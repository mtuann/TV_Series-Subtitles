    "she has those\nfeelings for someone else.",

    "I'm not tough.",
    "That's why I said \"act.\"",

    "Guys, hang on. Donna and I\nalready made plans this weekend.",
    "Well, then just leave us a key, man.\nAnd don't worry, if anything bad happens,",
    "I know how to make it look\nlike a robbery-homicide.",
    "Look, Eric and I\nwant one weekend alone",
    "where we don't have to be so\nsecretive about being engaged.",
    "I could even wear my ring if it\nweren't being resized for me.",
    "Can they make a ring big enough\nto fit your Paul Bunyan hands?",
    "- Jackie?\n- Well, I'm sorry, Donna.",
    "But if you're not gonna have a\nparty, you're gonna get insulted.",
    "It's just the way it is.",
    "The way I see it, unless Donna's\nblocking the door with her giant hands,",
    "we're coming over for a party.",
    "Oh-oh. We should get one of\nthose girls that jump out of cakes.",

    "Aw! That's awful bad luck.",

    "Good morning.",
    "Steven, you got a big\ntear in that jacket.",
    "Yeah. It's hard hopping over\na fence carrying two 12-packs.",

    "All right! Party time!\nI brought the Slip 'n Slide.",
    "- Let's move the couch.\n- Okay. I'll get the hose.",
    "No, we don't need the hose,\nman. We'll just use beer.",
    "- Kelso, are you nuts?\n- You're right.",
    "We don't wanna waste the beer.\nGo get the hose, man.",

    "I invited a girl in a halter-top\nwho was on her fifth beer.",
    "- Fifth beer! Halter-top!\n- Forget it, Kelso.",
    "But do you know what a Slip\n'n Slide can do to a halter-top?",
    "It turns it into a belt.",
    "- Hello?\n- Hello, is Mr. Forman there?",
    "No, I'm sorry. You just missed\nhim. Can I take a message?",
    "Yes. This is Fenton\nfrom All That Glitters.",
    "Mr. Forman bought a ring here,\nand I'm calling to tell him it's ready.",
    "And, ah, oh, it looks fabulous.",
    "He bought me a ring?",
    "I hope it wasn't a surprise. Perhaps\nyou shouldn't know that I called.",
    "Could you let Mr. Forman know\nthat I called? I mean...",
    "You shouldn't know\nthat he bought you... Oh!",
    "Now I've made a messy. Okay.",
    "Okay, dinner is all ready.",
    "I just had to add\nthe secret ingredient: love.",
    "By the way, \"love\" is salt.",

    "Is this red\nstuff gravy or blood?",
    "There's no gravy.",
    "Oh. Well, I guess\nit's just kind of moist then.",
    "Actually, it's kind of pink.\nIs this ham?",
    "No, it's Chicken Pinciotti.",
    "Mine looks fine.",
    "Well, if you don't wanna eat\nyours, we have some Fruity Pebbles.",
    "No... No. Grown-ups don't eat\nFruity Pebbles. They eat chicken.",
    "What grown-ups?",
    "Where are these grown-ups?",
    "Donna, us.",
    "The whole point of this weekend\nis to prove that we're grown-up",
    "and that Red doesn't know what he's\ntalking about when he says I'm immature.",
    "It is? I don't know. I thought the\npoint of this weekend was to have,",
    "you know, a fun, light weekend.",
    "Yeah. No, it will be fun and light.\nIt's just that in the next 36 hours,",
    "I would like to prove to myself",
    "that my father's been wrong\nabout me my entire life,",
    "but in a fun, light way.",
    "Well, whatever. You don't\nhave to eat the chicken.",
    "No! What? No. Are you\nkidding? I was kidding.",
    "I'm doing our grown-up, domestic\nsquabbling thing, you know?",
    "It's like,\nI make fun of your cooking,",
    "you tell me to put on pants\nwhen we have company.",
    "Are you gonna stop wearing your pants?\n'Cause I might have a problem with that.",
    "See? Good, we're bickering,\nlike husband and wife.",
    "What, you call this dinner?",
    "Hey, take my wife, please.",
    "That's delicious.",
    "Steven, just come in.\nYour jacket looks fine.",
    "Mrs. Forman, I don't think\nthis jacket's really my style.",
    "Oh, nonsense.",
    "Ever since I've know you, you've\nbeen nothing but flash and pizzazz.",
    "Oh, and look,\nit says \"stuntman\" on the arm.",
    "People are gonna think\nyou're from Hollywood.",
    "- Excuse me.\n- Yes? Oh. Mmm-hmm.",
    "I was wondering if I might look at\nthat ring you called Mr. Forman about",
    "that he doesn't\nknow I know about yet.",
    "Oh. I don't think I'm supposed\nto show you, but...",
    "But I do a lot of things behind\nthis counter I'm not supposed to do.",
    "So, hmm.",
    "This is an engagement ring.",
    "An engagement ring? Uh-oh.",
    "Why would Red give\nme a diamond ring?",
    "Maybe it's a menopause diamond.",
    "You know, for a happy menopause.",
    "Oh, oh, it's engraved.\n\"To Donna...\"",
    "You're a lucky woman, Donna.",
    "I mean, Mr. Forman seems\na tad young for you,",

    "Oh, my goodness!\nThis is from Eric to...",
    "Eric and Donna are engaged?",
    "Well, if they are, I'm learning\nit here for the first time.",
    "So, Mr. Stuntman...",
    "Are you from Hollywood?",
    "I gotta tell you, this being grown-up\nthing really seems to work for us.",
    "It's like we're already good\nat being married.",
    "All we did was eat.",
    "Hey, a little secret\nthey don't tell you?",
    "That's all marriage is.",

    "No! Okay? This house\nis closed to parties, okay?",
    "So just go away. Oh, and tell\nthe cast of Smokey and the Bandit",
    "that I said, \"10-4.\"",
    "Fine. I'm gone, man.",
    "Don't you mean, \"I'm eastbound\nand down, good buddy\"?",
    "What does a married couple do",
    "after a delicious dinner\nof Chicken Pinciotti?",
    "Well, we could\nmake out on the couch,",
    "but we're married, so maybe\nwe should just fight and go to bed.",
    "- Whoa.\n- What's wrong?",
    "Whoa!",
    "Okay, I think the Chicken\nPinciotti wants to fly the coop.",
    "Oh.",
    "I'm gonna be\nupstairs for a little bit.",
    "Do you have any magazines\nthat I could... Whoa! Okay.",
    "I'll\njust read the shampoo.",

    "You have to use\nthe one off the den.",
    "Right in there?",
    "While\nyou're right in here?",
    "I can't do that.\nYou might sense something.",
    "I might sense something? How\nmuch of a ruckus are you gonna make?",
    "What... I just...\nI can't go here, okay?",
    "And I can't go home because\nRed thinks I'm over at Fez's. What...",
    "I'm a man without a country.",
    "Eric, you wanted to\nbe grown-up. And...",
    "Well, this is something that\ngrown-ups do in the same house.",
    "No, I...\nYou know what I was thinking?",
    "I could build us another\nhouse, a separate house.",
    "Eric, you're\ntalking about an outhouse.",
    "Well, it's about time\nthose made a comeback!",
    "Eric and Donna can't be\nengaged. They're too young.",
    "How does something\nlike this happen?",
    "Well,\nEric asked her to marry him,",
    "and instead of saying, \"Ew,\"\nlike a normal person,",
    "Donna said yes.",
    "Well, I don't like\nsecret-keeping in my house.",
    "What else is going on\nthat I don't know about?",
    "Ooh. There is something else.",
    "In the back left\ncorner of Forman's closet,",
    "he has stashed some highly\noffensive photographic material.",
    "Well, this has gotta stop.",
    "Eric should have told me\nabout his engagement,",
    "because in this house\nwe do not keep secrets.",
    "What are you talking about?",
    "Cheesecake. Different\ntypes of cheesecake.",
    "Oh. Sorry I missed it.",
    "Don't judge me.",
    "Kelso,\nI need to use your bathroom.",
    "Nope. There's nobody here.",
    "Of course, I can't see people who\ndon't have parties for their friends.",
    "So maybe there is somebody\nhere, and I just can't see them.",
    "I can't see you, Eric!",
    "Kelso, I really need\nto use the bathroom.",
    "Well, maybe you should have\nthought of that",
    "before you kicked us out of\nDonna's house, you party pooper.",
    "- Yeah.\n- No party, no pooper!",
    "- Nice.\n- Yeah, it really was. No party, no pooper!",
    "So then I said, \"No party, no pooper!\"\nBecause he wouldn't have a party.",
    "See, I think it's stupid that Eric and\nDonna need to practice being married.",
    "I mean, it's simple.",
    "The woman just needs to be\na cook in the kitchen,",
    "a maid in the living room,\nand an acrobat in the bedroom.",
    "And I can hire\na cook and a maid.",
    "I am liking you more and more.",
    "You know, I was thinking\nabout The Incredible Hulk.",
    "I like that show.",
    "Especially the part where he\ngets all, like, mad and turns green",
    "and then his shirt rips off.",
    "But then I was thinking,\nlike, what if he was purple?",
    "And a lady?",
    "Come on. Like an\nangry, naked purple chick.",

    "What's going on down here?",

    "I need bacon.",
    "Okay, the reason I'd lie\nabout something like that is...",

    "If you're done reciting\npoetry, I'd like to yell at the kid.",
    "Hey, Forman,\nthis is about to get ugly.",
    "So if you have to go potty,\nnow's a good time.",
    "I'm sorry.",
    "Okay, I shouldn't have\ntold you I was at Fez's.",
    "Do you ever think\nabout what you're doing with your life?",
    "Hey, Dad, it's my life, okay?\nI'm grown-up now.",
    "Grown-up?",
    "Well, you sure say that a lot,\nso it must be true. Let me try it.",
    "Hey,\neverybody, I'm Mister Rogers.",
    "But wait,\nI'm not wearing a sweater.",
    "And I'm about to kick your ass.",
    "Maybe it doesn't work.",
    "Maybe you're just an immature\npissant who still lies to his parents.",
    "You know what, Dad?",
    "Oh, my God. You're right.",
    "I have been lying, and acting\nimmature, and keeping secrets.",
    "And I swear to God, I'm\njust as sick of it as you are.",

    "I get his room.",

    "- I already gave her the ring.\n- Kitty, are you hearing this?",
    "Yes, I am.",
    "And for the first time, too.",
    "Well, it's true.",
    "So, if I'm gonna be ready\nto be married, which I am,",
    "then I guess I should be ready\nto tell you the truth.",
    "So, there it is.",
    "Wow. That felt great.",
    "I'm gonna go see my fiancee.\nWow, that felt great, too.",
    "What a great day!",
    "Okay. Okay, this is good.",

    "No, you guys will be great.\nAll little girls love their daddies.",
    "Plus, I bet you'll probably\nlike a lot of the same toys.",
    "Oh, I'm late.",
    "Oh, yes.",
    "Hi.",
    "Bye, bye, Betsy-pie.\nMommy loves you.",
    "- Yes, she does. Yes, she does.\n- All right, hand her over.",
    "- You're so attached. Just...\n- Oh!",
    "Look, don't worry.\nAll she does is sleep.",
    "It's like taking care\nof a bowling ball.",
    "I don't like bowling, man.",
    "You throw the ball down there\nand it keeps coming back.",
    "It's spooky, man.",
    "Okay, Donna, I just\nspent the last 10 minutes",
    "cologning and powdering myself.",
    "Now, let's peel them\nand feel them.",
    "We can't because Fez is here.",
    "Yeah. I'm here and you can't.",
    "Fez, buddy, come on.",
    "You of all people should understand\nhow important sex is to a man.",
    "- Why should you do it\nif I can't?\n- Because I have a girlfriend.",
    "Why should you have\na girlfriend if I can't?",
    "- Okay, how are we gonna\nwork this out?\n- Give her to me.",
    "Guys, check it out. Brooke\nfinally let me take care of Betsy.",
    "We're gonna stay here\nfor the day, okay?",
    "No. Come on. Donna and I\nhave a \"do it\" day planned.",
    "Yeah, and I think\nI got a piece of this.",
    "Look, why don't you do it\nat your house?",
    "I can't. My brother's friends\nare over there,",
    "and they're playing darts,\nand they don't use a dartboard.",
    "They just run around\nand throw them at each other.",
    "Okay, Donna, I'm gonna go upstairs\nand change into something sexy.",
    "Now either you come join me\nin 60 seconds,",
    "or I'm gonna have to start\nwithout you,",
    "and we both know how awkward\nit is when you walk in on that.",
    "What's this?",
    "That's breast milk.\nDon't touch it.",
    "Breast milk?\nFrom real breasts?",
    "What don't they do?",

    "- What do you want me\nto do with it?\n- Just chuck it.",
    "- What about the shark?\n- Chuck it. Chuck it all.",
    "Why is she still crying?\nWe just changed her.",
    "Maybe she doesn't like you.\nBaby burn.",
    "No. I know what it is.",
    "We left her teddy bear at\nmy house. I'll go get it. Here.",
    "Um...",
    "Aren't you gonna\ntake her with you?",
    "No, I can't take Betsy\nin my car.",
    "I took out the seat belts\nto make it go faster.",
    "Okay, don't grab those.\nI'm not your mommy.",
    "Yeah, a lady once said that\nto me on the bus.",
    "Well, it wasn't a lady.\nIt was more like a man lady.",
    "It's hard to tell sometimes,\nyou know?",
    "Why tell this story, Fez?",
    "Why?",
    "Yeah, man, look at this place.\nChrome, tires, half-dressed women.",
    "It's like Sunday dinner\nat my grandma's house.",
    "All right, salesmen, pucker up.",
    "Red Forman's ass\nis in the building.",
    "Okay, well, mine's gone.\nI give yours about 30 seconds.",
    "All right, Jackie, so let's\nstart off looking at new tires.",
    "Then after lunch, you can help me\npick out an obnoxiously loud car stereo.",
    "Wait, you're gonna spend\nthe day with Jackie?",
    "Yeah, man. She's my chick. All\nright, I'm gonna go get us a funnel cake.",
    "But listen, this is a\nrough crowd, all right?",
    "So if any guys come up to you and\noffer to teach you how to drive a stick,",
    "just say no\nand pull the fire alarm.",
    "- Told you he wouldn't ditch me.\n- I'm his chick.",
    "Jackie, he's a man.",
    "Accept the fact\nthat he is not coming back.",
    "When I was in labor,\nRed went to get me ice chips.",
    "I didn't see him\nfor an hour-and-a-half",
    "because he found\na pinball machine.",
    "- No way.\n- But it's fine.",
    "I laugh about it now.",
    "I do.",
    "I will.",
    "It's just not that funny.",
    "- I think she's out.\n- Well, in that case...",
    "Eric, we can't do that\nwith her in here.",
    "What? Come on.\nShe's fast asleep.",
    "And it's been\nover a week for us.",
    "Donna, you can only keep\nthe tiger in its cage for so long.",
    "Yeah, that's right.\nI'm calling it a tiger now.",
    "- Crap, the baby's awake.\n- No, no, no, no, no.",
    "Hey, Betsy, close your eyes",
    "because Aunt Donna and\nUncle Eric are gonna do it.",
    "Eric, you are\nseriously disturbed.",
    "- We have to take care of her.\n- No, no, come on. She's fine.",
    "You can't put the tiger\nback in his cage now, Donna.",
    "He's all agitated.",
    "How can a crying baby\nnot turn you off?",
    "Two words, Donna, eight teen.\nNothing turns me off.",
    "Yeah?",
    "Hey, Fez.",
    "Why are you staring\nat that milk?",
    "It's from a breast.",
    "Simply remarkable.",
    "Okay, you're clearly a demented\npervert so let me ask you something.",
    "Would you be able to have sex\nwith a baby in the room?",
    "No way. I can barely do it\nwith a woman in the room.",
    "Congratulations, Eric. You're\nmore despicable sexually than Fez.",
    "Okay, Donna, here's the thing.",
    "I'm a man, so my\non-off switch is always on.",
    "Now you can either deal with\nthat, or you can switch to girls.",
    "Donna, if that's your baby,\nI'm gonna snap Eric in half.",
    "Dad, don't you think you would\nhave noticed if I was pregnant?",
    "Not really. I'm not\nthat hands-on of a dad.",
    "Anyhoo, I bought a hammock\nand put it up in the den",
    "'cause it's too cold outside.\nNow I need someone to push me.",
    "Sure, I'll push you\nin the hammock, Bob.",
    "Then I'll climb up a tree\nand pluck you a fresh coconut.",

    "Okay. I got\nBetsy's teddy bear,",

    "I got a dart in the calf.",
    "Oh, here's my little girl.",
    "Hey, baby, look.",
    "Look, it's your teddy bear\nand your handsome daddy.",
    "Why won't she stop crying?",
    "Maybe it is me.",
    "What if she doesn't like me?",
    "Kelso, don't take it personally.",
    "I didn't like you\nwhen I first met you.",
    "But that's because you\nwere peeing on my swing set.",
    "Well, it was brand-new\nand I was jealous.",
    "One funnel cake, extra sugar.",
    "Oh, Steven, I knew\nyou'd come back,",
    "and to show you how thankful I\nam, I'm gonna feed you a piece.",
    "Oh, get a room.",
    "- Did you see Red?\n- He didn't come back yet?",

    "isn't putting her\nin a great mood.",
    "It always works for me.",

    "All these houses look alike.",
    "Except for that red one on the\ncorner where the clown lives.",
    "That's a McDonald's.",
    "Well, whatever his name is,\nhe's funny.",
    "Hey, what's with the baby, man?",
    "I don't know. I can't\nget her to quit crying.",
    "Here, let me try.",
    "Yeah.",
    "There.",
    "How did you do that?",
    "Babies love me, man,\n'cause I'm fuzzy.",
    "I'll go give her a bottle.",
    "That proves it.\nMy own baby hates me.",
    "That's not true.",
    "She only stopped crying\nwhen Leo held her",
    "because he has the shakes.",
    "No. It's me.",
    "She hardly knows me,",

    "What happens if she grows up\nand starts dating, like, Fez?",
    "Boy, if she looks anything like\nyou, she'll be way out of my league.",
    "Kelso, if you really feel like that, you\nshould start getting to know her now.",
    "Go hold her.",
    "You're right.",
    "Leo?",
    "Oh, my God. They're gone.",
    "Everybody.\nEverybody, just stay calm.",
    "The breast milk is safe.",
    "Are they outside?",
    "Not in the driveway, but\nEric went to check the park.",
    "And they're not upstairs.",
    "Although I did find Kitty's\nspecial occasion panties",
    "hanging on the towel bar.",
    "There's a lot more going on\nup there than we think.",
    "How could I let this happen?",
    "I am the worst father ever.",
    "Betsy?",
    "No, Michael, it's me. I'm calling\nto check in. How's she doing?",
    "How's she doing? Fine.\nGod, quit smothering her.",
    "Hey, put the phone to her ear,\nlet me say hi.",
    "It's Brooke.\nShe wants to talk to the baby.",
    "Give me.",
    "Hey, Mama, send more milk.",

    "Oh! Um...",
    "Well, not a lot.",
    "I read comic books,",
    "- acted out movies\nwith my dolls...\n- Action figures.",
    "Okay, you always insist that\nthey are called action figures.",
    "You know, if Eric had told me he\nhad wasted a whole year of his life,",

    "You just sit around doing your nails\nand making smart-ass comments.",
    "Jackie, that's you.",
    "Yeah, well,\nit's annoying now, isn't it?",
    "How'd you get a promotion? You\ndon't know anything about music.",
    "Last week a guy came\nin asking for KISS,",

    "You put ketchup on everything.",
    "You'll starve to death.",
    "Can you believe\nhow much she's freaking out?",
    "No, I cannot believe that someone\nyou supposedly love is upset",
    "that you decided to go to Africa\nwithout considering her feelings at all.",
    "See? Donna understands.",
    "So, there's a problem with my\nsleeping-with-Angie's-best-friend plan.",
    "Angie's best friend is Hyde.",
    "You know what we\nmay have to do here?",
    "The dark room switch.",
    "You will make love to her in a dark room,\nhalfway through you will excuse yourself.",
    "Then I'll come in, pretend\nto be you, and finish the job.",

    "You guys, Donna's totally\nfreaking out about this Africa thing.",

    "- You mean my daughter Angie?\n- I stand by my statement.",
    "You can't hit a girl.",
    "Look, if this is about me\nnot being professional,",
    "I've already told you, bottle\nrocket Friday nights are over.",
    "Steven, I'm moving Angie to Milwaukee\nto get her away from the customers.",
    "I love my little girl, but you're the\none who should be running that store.",
    "So, it's yours.",
    "Whoa.",
    "- Thanks, man.\n- Oh,\nmy God, I own a record store!",
    "No, I own a record store.",
    "Actually, I own a record store.",
    "I own one-third\nof a record store.",

    "Eric, if you wanna break up\nwith me, just go ahead and do it.",
    "What? No. Donna, I'm\nnot breaking up with you.",
    "Really? Well, did you consider me at all\nbefore you decided to run away to Africa?",
    "Okay, look, Donna,",
    "the reason I'm\ndoing this is for us.",

    "That lady at the fair\nwho did the caricatures?",
    "She refused to draw him\n'cause she couldn't find a flaw.",
    "Oh, please.\nThat lady had no talent.",
    "Did you see how big\nshe drew my mouth?",
    "- Hey.\n- Hey.",
    "- Any luck finding that ring?\n- No.",
    "But we did find a broken\nhigh heel, some old stockings,",
    "and an empty pack of Marlboros.",
    "Yeah. So it looks like Steven's\nmom has been here, too.",
    "You don't know my mom.\nShe smokes Luckys.",
    "Well, maybe it's time we shake\nup the search parties a little bit.",
    "Tell you what, I'll flip a coin. Heads\nme and Donna, tails me and Jackie.",
    "It's heads, Donna, come on.",
    "Wait, no, no! I can't go with\nSteven. He's a disgusting pig.",
    "Yeah. She's a stuck-up princess\nwho only cares about looks and money.",
    "Oh, don't try to sweet-talk me.",
    "Okay, look, we're not going\nto find this stupid ring anyway,",
    "so let's just get out of here.",
    "Where's Fez?",
    "Well, Goldie,",
    "it seems that we're lost\nin a dark, cold, lonely cave.",

    "Your eyes are\nbugging out of your head.",
    "But I'm glad you're here.",
    "'Cause at least I can have\na conversation with a fish.",
    "Otherwise I'd be losing my mind.",
    "Fez?",
    "- Where is he?\n- Oh, don't worry.",
    "He survived his trip over here in a\nbanana crate, he'll be fine in the woods.",
    "Actually, I'm kind\nof worried about him.",
    "It's dark, it's cold, there's\nno pornography anywhere.",
    "What was that?",
    "That was a wild Canadian boar.",
    "They feed on likeable girls.",
    "You're safe.",
    "You know, being out here like\nthis, without any TV or magazines,",
    "you know, makes me realize how\npeople 500 years ago must have felt.",
    "Incredibly bored.",
    "By the way, Donna, if you're\never lost in the outdoors,",
    "just find the North Star.",
    "Its gentle twinkling will\ncomfort you as you slowly die.",
    "Oh. Ew!",
    "What, now we have to cross\na disgusting river?",
    "Jackie, it's just a creek.",
    "Okay, fine. Why don't\nyou take your shoe off,",
    "we'll all get in and\nrow ourselves across.",
    "- Allow me, milady.\n- Thank you.",
    "Wait, how am I\nsupposed to get across?",
    "Come across like you\nalways do. Real bitchy.",
    "Oh. Okay, you know what?",
    "Even when we were dating, you\nnever did the gentlemanly thing.",
    "All right, fine,\ngive me your hand.",
    "No, I am not touching that hand.",
    "You have been burping\nin that hand all day.",
    "Come on, you've touched\ngrosser things than this.",
    "You went out with\nKelso for four years.",
    "Oh.",
    "Okay, you know what,\nI'll just get myself across.",
    "Well, that couldn't have\nworked out any better.",
    "Well, Goldie, if my internal\nclock is correct,",
    "we've been here either\nan hour, or a month.",
    "Man, I'm terribly thirsty.",
    "Hope you don't mind, I'm going\nto drink a little bit of your water.",
    "You peed in there.",
    "Well, I made Bob\ngo and get the kids.",
    "Maybe they'll find the ring, maybe\nnot, either way, I got rid of Bob.",
    "I can't believe you lied to me\nabout that ring.",
    "Listen, Kitty.",
    "When I got back from Korea,",
    "I wanted to buy you the\nnicest engagement ring ever.",
    "But I wasn't making much money.",
    "And when I realized how long I\nwould have to save to get that ring,",
    "I just knew I couldn't wait that\nlong to ask you to marry me.",
    "Well, that's true.\nI had other offers.",
    "Jimmy Callahan used to call me\n\"sweet knees\" and he was absolutely right.",
    "So, I bought the best that I could\nafford and I was going to tell you",
    "that we'd get a better ring\nwhen we had the money.",
    "But then it all went wrong.",
    "You loved the ring, you said it must've\ncost $1,000 and you were so excited.",
    "I just couldn't let you down.",
    "Red.",
    "But I'll tell you what.",
    "If the kids don't find the old\none, I'll get you another ring.",
    "The kind that you deserve for\nputting up with me all these years.",
    "Well, I don't want\nyou to sell the house.",
    "Hey, Donna, you know when you see\na flock of ducks flying in a \"V\" formation,",
    "one side looks longer than\nthe other, you know why that is?",
    "- No?\n- More ducks.",
    "Hey, we lost Jackie and Hyde.",

    "Okay, I have been holding this in for,\nlike, three hours and I can't do it anymore.",
    "Yeah, I know. You like Randy, you're\njealous of my hair. Blah, blah, blah.",

    "I mean, we are complete opposites.\nIt's like I'm Beauty and he is the Beast.",
    "Um, Jackie, at the end of the story,\nBeauty and the Beast get together.",
    "Oh, would you\nshut up, you reader?",
    "Look, there are plenty of other\nthings on this list. For instance,",
    "my perfect guy compliments me,\nbuys me presents and comes when I call.",
    "And none of that describes Fez.",
    "Did you call me?",
    "- What? No, I...\n- Wow, Jackie,\nyou look fantastic today.",

    "And the only other time I've\nseen such a big smile on your face",
    "was when you got Fez and Kelso\nto smash their heads together",

    "Oh.",
    "Oh, I can't believe this.",
    "Yeah, me neither.",

    "And I think that, with this\ncheck, we can just about do it.",
    "If it's okay with you.",
    "Oh, Red. You don't have to ask\nmy permission for anything.",
    "You have fought in two wars,\nyou have worked your whole life.",

    "Well, I couldn't have done it\nwithout my best gal!",

    "into a parking lot?",
    "As long as that check clears,",
    "I don't care if they turn it into\na Communist recreation center.",
    "Anyway,\nwhat happened to you and Sam?",
    "Oh, well. We finally got\nsome time alone, we talked,",
    "I told her I thought it'd be a\nmistake if we stayed together,",
    "she agreed and we hugged.",
    "Then she jumped back on the\nmain stage and finished out her act.",
    "Well, you two kids lasted\nlonger than I expected.",
    "I thought she was gonna knock you out\nand steal your wallet on the first night.",
    "- Hey.\n- Hey.",
    "Thought you'd be\nhalfway to Vegas by now.",
    "Hyde, I'm really sorry\nhow things worked out.",
    "Yeah, me, too.",
    "But I like to think if our paths ever cross\nagain that I'd be able to give you $20",
    "and you'd be able to dance for\nme and it wouldn't be awkward.",
    "I'd like that.",
    "- Bye.\n- See ya.",
    "- You all right?\n- Yeah.",
    "Let me tell you something, son.\nI dodged a lot of bullets in Korea,",
    "but not one as crazy and blonde\nas the one that you just side-stepped.",
    "It's weird, man.",
    "I never imagined myself\ndivorced from a Vegas stripper",
    "with a second\nhusband at this age.",
