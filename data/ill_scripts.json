    "Well, won't you, won't you sit down?",
    "Yes.",

    "maybe we could discuss about...",

    "Well, you got any ideas?",
    "No.",

    "and one of the bad skins slipped past\nthe fur inspector.",
    "What?\nSure.",
    "And you have to have that coat\nfumigated.",
    "Otherwise, she might break out with",
    "a very bad case of mink pox.",
    "Mink's pox?",
    "Yeah, and it sounds even worse with\nyour accent.",
    "Now look, Fred, never mind, I don't\nlike that.",
    "Look, you remember the idea I had\nabout the burglar?",
    "Yeah.",
    "All right, the burglar is going to\nshow up tonight.",
    "What?",
    "Tonight when we sound sleep,",
    "a phony burglar is going to come in\nhere",
    "and demand that coat at the point of\na gun.",
    "Hey, that's wonderful!",
    "Besides, there's been a burglar scare",
    "in the neighborhood lately.",
    "Yeah, that's what gave me the idea.",
    "Do you suppose she'll think he's a\nphony?",
    "Not if you cover your face with a\nmask.",
    "That's a good idea.",
    "Hey, wait a minute, now.",
    "I draw the line at prowling around",
    "in other people's apartments in the\nmiddle of the night.",
    "Now, look, Fred.",
    "Uh... let's look at it this way.",
    "If you don't do it, Lucy will keep\nthe coat.",

    "Are you still moping 'cause Ricky\ndidn't struggle",
    "with an armed burglar?",
    "Well, you should have seen it.",
    "Ricky gave him the coat.",
    "I'm surprised he didn't gift wrap it\nfor him.",
    "Oh...",
    "Well, the way Ricky was acting,",
    "it's good the burglar didn't come in\nand ask for me.",
    "Now, Lucy.",
    "I'm sure Ricky would have been brave",

    "What do you mean-- real burglar?",
    "Uh... nothing, just, uh...",
    "Ethel, what did you start to say?",
    "Well, I might as well tell you.",
    "It's better than",
    "your thinking Ricky is a coward,\nanyway.",
    "Was it a real burglar or wasn't it?",
    "It really was, but Ricky thought it\nwas Fred.",
    "Fred?",
    "Yes, that's why he didn't try to\nfight him.",
    "Well, why would Fred pretend to be a\nburglar?",
    "Uh... I can't tell you any more.",

    "No, honey.",
    "Oh...",
    "But at least you know",
    "Ricky isn't a coward.",

    "No, please, please.",

    "Please...",

    "Well, listen, honey, thank you very\nmuch.",
    "Can I forget about Peggy now?",
    "I hope so.",
    "Hey, you know, this Arthur was so shy",
    "I practically had to lasso him to get\nhim in here.",
    "No kidding?",
    "Yeah. It was really unbelievable.",
    "And then, after we'd been dancing",
    "for a couple of minutes, he suddenly\nlooked me in the eye",
    "and said, \"I love you.\"",
    "Oh, no.",
    "Yeah.",
    "That's very funny.",
    "In love with you!",
    "That's a scream.",
    "Ha, ha.",
    "Oh, now, honey, you must admit it's\npretty funny.",
    "Look, I'll admit I'm old enough to be\nhis... sister...",

    "Me.",
    "You?",
    "Yes. I'm going to make a bust of\nmyself.",
    "I thought you'd already done that.",
    "(laughs)",

    "to look at my work.",

    "it will really impress him.",
    "Well, I hope your head turns out",
    "better than Fred's arm.",
    "It will.",
    "This book tells how to make a mold",
    "of anything that you want to copy.",
    "You mean, you're going to make a mold\nof your..?",
    "Yeah. I'm going to make an impression",
    "of my head and face.",
    "I'm going to put clay in it, take the\nmold away,",
    "and I'll have a perfect replica of my\nhead.",
    "Hey, Lucy, that's a wonderful idea.",
    "Yeah, and it's so easy, too.\nI got the plaster all mixed.",
    "Now listen, \"Cover the object to be\ncopied",
    "\"with plaster of paris and let it\nremain this way",

    "What?",
    "You mean, you're going to bury your\nhead",
    "in plaster of paris?",
    "Sure.",
    "But you won't be able to breathe.",
    "Oh. I never thought of that.",
    "Well, what am I going to do?",
    "It has to be a perfect likeness to\nget by that art critic.",
    "Maybe the book tells some other way\nto do it.",
    "Let's see.",
    "What's the matter?",
    "Ethel!\nI can't get my arm out!",
    "You're stuck?",
    "Oh, hey, look, pull, pull hard.",
    "I can't get it out!",
    "Well, let me try...",

    "Would you like me to show you her\nwork?",
    "Oh, no, I th...\nI think we better, uh, wait",

    "Uh, if you don't mind, Mr. Ricardo,",
    "I always prefer",
    "to look at these amateur attempts",
    "uh, without the artist being present.",
    "Oh, all right.",
    "What did she sculpt this time?",
    "She made a head of herself.",
    "She did, huh?",
    "Oh, you should have seen her.",
    "She put up seven mirrors all around",
    "so she'd cover every angle.",
    "(chuckling): Oh, no.",
    "Oh, this is really pretty good.",
    "Are you ready?",
    "Oh, I can hardly wait.",
    "All right.",
    "There.",
    "Hey, you know something?",
    "It kind of looks like her.",
    "I told you it was good.",

    "I know why.",
    "Fred just told me.",
    "Why?",
    "Well, Eddie thought",
    "you were making that date with him\nfor yourself,",
    "and being a man,",
    "he couldn't help bragging to Ricky\nand Fred",
    "that he had a heavy date.",
    "And Ricky and Fred-- also being men--",
    "decided to go down there and spy on\nhim.",
    "So Ricky must have thought...",
    "Oh, no, Ricky was just mad at me",
    "because I was matchmaking.",
    "Are you sure?",
    "Well, one thing I'm sure of:",
    "we got to get Ricky and Eddie",

    "Fresh.",
    "Eddie?",
    "Hello, Eddie.",

    "(with husky voice:)\nTelegram for Mr. Grant.",
    "Eddie, we've got to talk to you.",
    "Eddie, we just got to talk to you,",
    "you understand?",
    "Now, Eddie, I've just got to talk to\nyou.",
    "Listen, I'm in a spot",
    "because you jumped to some stupid\nconclusions.",
    "Ethel, get Sylvia on the phone, will\nyou?",
    "Sylvia Collins?",
    "Yes, Sylvia Collins, that very nice\ngirl",
    "I tried to get you a date with.",

    "Hello.",
    "No.",
    "No, she was exaggerating.",
    "Well, I guess it is a little curly.",
    "Oh, just average height.",
    "It's too bad we couldn't get together\nyesterday, Syl.",
    "Well, how about today?",
    "Wonderful.",
    "I'll be down and get you in about a\nhalf hour.",
    "What's that address again?",
    "Swell.",
    "So I'll be right down.",
    "Bye, Sylvia.",

    "She sounds wonderful.",
    "You see?",
    "You'll bring her here",
    "and then we'll go down to the club",
    "and explain to Ricky.",
    "Okay, I will.",
    "Incidentally, girls, while I'm gone,",

    "thinking he had a date with Lucy?",
    "Yeah, how about that?",
    "He said 925, didn't he?",
    "Yeah.",
    "I'd be a fine husband",
    "if I didn't trust my wife any more\nthan that.",
    "(shouting:)\nLucy!",
    "Lucy, open the door!",
    "Open the door!",
    "Now, now, Ricky, I know this looks\nbad",
    "and I can explain...",
    "I think.",
    "Lucy, you here, dressed in that.",
    "You must be out of your mind.",
    "ETHEL: Who is it, Lucy?",

    "Okay.",
    "Go ahead.",
    "Go ahead.",
    "Well, even though you told me not to,",
    "I fixed Eddie up with a date with\nSylvia for lunch",

    "and we called Eddie and he wasn't in",
    "so I came down to the hotel to tell\nEddie",
    "and then you saw us and got mad",
    "so I had to come down again today and\ntell Eddie",
    "and we called Sylvia and Eddie went\nover to get her",
    "and while he was gone",
    "he said if we found some negligees\nthat we wanted",
    "we could have them wholesale.",
    "That's exactly what happened.",
    "And it was all my fault and I'm\nsorry.",
    "You told me not to meddle in other\npeople's affairs",
    "and I did and I'm really sorry.",
    "That is the most ridiculous story\nI've ever heard.",
    "Isn't it, Fred?",
    "I'll say.",
    "Well, that makes me mad.",
    "It makes you mad?",
    "Yes, I tell you the truth,",
    "I admit it's all my fault,",
    "I practically grovel at your feet",
    "and you say you don't believe it.",

    "Yeah.",
    "All right, Ethel.",
    "If they want the real story,",
    "let's give it to them.",

    "Now, listen, we got to get ahold of\nourselves.",

    "I know!",
    "After Ricky goes to work tonight,",
    "we'll watch her and see what she\ndoes.",
    "We'll go up on the roof and come down\nthe fire escape",
    "and watch her through the window.",
    "What will that prove?",
    "Well, if she doesn't put on your suit",
    "and go out and come back later",
    "with a bag full of loot, then she\nisn't Madame X.",
    "That won't prove anything.",

    "What was she doing out there on that\nfire escape",
    "wearing a man's hat and coat?",

    "I'd like nothing better than to find\na good reason.",
    "I've been thinking and thinking and I\ncan't find one.",
    "Well, now, you don't really think\nthat Ethel is Madame X?",
    "Of course not, but how can I prove\nit?",
    "Well, why don't you just ask her\nabout it?",
    "Oh, sure.\nWhat am I gonna say?",
    "\"Hi, Ethel, robbed any good\napartments lately?\"",
    "You know what I mean.",
    "Tell her that you saw her out on the\nfire escape.",
    "Oh, I can't do that.",
    "Why not?",
    "If she's not Madame X,",
    "she'll tell why she was out there.",
    "And if she is, she'll shoot me.",
    "We got to be clever about this,\nRicky.",
    "What do the police do when they\nsuspect someone?",
    "Oh, well, they got a whole routine.",
    "What kind of a routine?",

    "Wait a minute.\nWait a minute.",
    "Just serve two drinks.",
    "Just two?",

    "LUCY: Oh, well, how did we do?",
    "Well, it only took us one hour and a\nhalf",
    "to get to the first green.",
    "Well, that ought to be some kind of a\nrecord.",
    "I would say so, yeah, yeah.",
    "Now what do we do?",

    "Yeah.\nOh?",
    "Uh-oh!",
    "What's the matter?",

    "this game is so much like hockey.",
    "That's right, yeah.",
    "Now, you see, uh...",
    "the idea of putting here",
    "is that you try to get your ball in\nthe cup",
    "and at the same time,",
    "you try to keep the other players'\nball",
    "from getting into the cup.",
    "Okay.\nOkay.",
    "Now, I'll count to three",

    "Old sticky fingers got it away from\nme.",
    "Oh...",
    "Well, I couldn't have loaned it to\nyou anyway",

    "Right.",
    "Uh, per day that is only...",
    "17 and 3/4 cents.",
    "17 and 3/4 cents.",
    "Correct.",
    "Well, obviously, a family of three",
    "cannot live on that.",
    "True.",
    "So, you will just have to give me\nmore money.",
    "Not a chance.",
    "(coughs)",
    "Well, my goodness, it's our money!",
    "I'm sorry, Mrs. Ricardo.",
    "But that's what you hired me for.",
    "Well, we didn't hire you",
    "to keep our money when we need it.",
    "Now, Mr. Hickox, I'm just going to\nhave to have more money.",
    "After all, half of that money is\nmine.",
    "I worked very hard around here.",
    "I take care of the house and I take\ncare of that baby",
    "and if you don't appreciate what I\ndo,",
    "then I guess you just don't want me\naround here!",
    "I can always take little Ricky\nand-and leave you,",
    "you selfish beast!",
    "You'd better save that for Mr.\nRicardo.",
    "Oh.",
    "Now, look Mr. Hickox, I can't believe",
    "that a charming, wonderful,\nunderstanding man like you",
    "would refuse to give me a few paltry\nlittle dollars.",
    "Uh, Mrs. Ricardo...",
    "Oh, my goodness!",
    "I never noticed what beautiful blue\neyes you have.",

    "I know.",
    "I know, Mr. Hickox, it's all right.",
    "Don't worry about me, I'll manage\nsomehow.",
    "Of course, towards the end of the\nmonth,",
    "we'll probably get pretty hungry,",
    "and the baby won't have any milk,",
    "the poor little thin thing.",
    "(sniffling)",
    "Well, now, Mrs. Ricardo,",
    "you probably have a point there as\nfar as food is concerned.",
    "I tell you what I'll do.",
    "You'll give me more money?",
    "No.",
    "I'll arrange some credit,",

    "Aw, you poor little thing,",

    "Now, Ricky, don't get all excited.",
    "Just be sensible.",
    "I'm not gonna tell my mother she\ncan't go",

    "Yeah.",

    "What are you talking about?",
    "We're not going to California,",
    "that's what we're talking about.",
    "But why?",

    "What is the matter?",
    "Nothing's the matter.",
    "Go ahead and have a nice trip.",

    "Ethel heard you!",
    "How could she have heard me?!",
    "How could she help hearing you",
    "with your big mouth and her big\nears?!",
    "Now, look, I'm not going to take the\nrap for this.",
    "I wanted the Mertzes along.",
    "You know that.",
    "This whole thing wouldn't have\nhappened",
    "if you hadn't insisted to bring your\nmother along, too.",
    "Honestly, your mother is the most...",
    "Hello, mother!",
    "(Little Ricky fussing)",
    "Oh, darling...",
    "Oh, Mother, I told you not to give\nhim any candy.",
    "Oh, is that what you spelled out?",
    "Oh...\t\tOh, now,",
    "one little lollipop won't hurt him.",
    "And grandma knows what's best for\nhim, doesn't she?",
    "You'd better put him down for his\nnap.",
    "Okay, dear.",
    "Oh, dear.",
    "(Little Ricky crying)",

    "Ethel.",
    "Oh.",
    "Hello, Ethel.",
    "Ethel, listen to me.",
    "Ethel, listen!",
    "Now, you know Ricky didn't mean that.",
    "You know how he is when he gets\nexcited.",
    "Now, listen, if I'd taken half the\nthings",
    "he said to me seriously, I'd have\nleft him long ago.",
    "(click)\nWhat? Hello?",
    "Hello?",
    "She hung up.",
    "Well, I don't blame her.",
    "Lucy? Micky?",
    "I want to speak to you about\nsomething.",
    "What is it, Mother?",
    "I didn't say anything in front of the\nbaby",
    "because little pitchers have big\nears.",
    "I ran into the Mertzes in the hall.",
    "Yes?",
    "They told me they're not going to\nCalifornia and I know why.",
    "You do?",
    "Yes. It's because of me.",
    "Now, just a minute, Mother.",
    "It has nothing to do with you.",
    "Oh, yes, it has.",
    "Everything was all right until I\ndecided to go.",
    "I'm the fly in the ointment.",
    "Well, I'm not going.",
    "You are, too.",
    "Oh, no, I'm not.",
    "Ricky...",
    "Well, honey, she's made up her mind.",
    "You tell my mother she has got to go.",
    "Honey, you don't want to force her.",
    "That would make her unhappy.",
    "All right, let me tell you something.",
    "If Mother isn't going, I'm not going.",
    "All right, then let me tell you\nsomething.",
    "If you're not going, I'm not going.",
    "Okay.",
    "Okay.",
    "(knock at door)",
    "May we come in again?",
    "Why not?",
    "We got to talking it over",
    "and we decided we acted pretty\nchildish.",
    "Yeah, we cooled off.",
    "We realize that Ricky said what he\ndid",
    "because he was a little upset about\nyour, uh...",
    "But, anyway, he didn't mean it.",
    "So, we're going to go on the trip\nafter all.",
    "Well, I hope you have a good time.",
    "Send us a postcard when you get out\nthere.",
    "What do you mean?",
    "Nobody's going.",
    "What's she talking about?",
    "We had a beef.",
    "The trip has been called off.",
    "And it's all my fault.",
    "I realized that you weren't going\nbecause of me, so I...",
    "Oh, no, honey, that wasn't it at all.",
    "We had a little misunderstanding",
    "and we just decided to forget it,",
    "so now we're going.",
    "Are you sure?",
    "ETHEL: Sure.",
    "Well, I wasn't going to go",
    "because you weren't going to if I was\ngoing.",
    "But if you're going when I'm going,",
    "I might as well go.",
    "What did she say?",
    "I don't know, but I think she's going\nto go.",
    "Of course she is.",
    "And I wasn't going because she wasn't\ngoing.",
    "But if she's going, I might as well\ngo.",
    "So, now everybody's going except,\nuh...",
    "I'm out of the mood.",
    "You four take the trip.",
    "Now, Ricky, if you're not going, I'm\nnot going.",
    "But if Lucy's not going, I certainly\nam not going.",
    "Well, if you three aren't going, we\ncertainly can't...",
    "Wait a minute, wait a minute.",
    "Oh, what a bunch of characters I'm\nmixed up with.",
    "Look, I'm going, everybody's going,",
    "Mother's going, everything's fine.",
    "Now, the only thing I insist on is an\nearly start.",
    "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
    "So, please pack all your things up\ntonight.",
    "We're going to leave at 6:00 a.m. in\nthe morning.",
    "(chatting excitedly)",
    "Room for all these, Rick?",
    "Oh, yeah. It's like a dance hall in\nhere.",
    "Here, give me those.",
    "(grunting)",
    "This is all the heavy stuff.",
    "The girls are bringing down some odds\nand ends later.",
    "Oh, that's good.",
    "Yeah.",
    "There we go.",
    "Fine.",
    "See?\nYeah, easy.",
    "How about that, huh?",
    "Yeah, how about that?",
    "Well, you can always tie a rope on it",
    "and drag it along behind.",
    "No, we got plenty of room.",
    "Yeah, put it over there.",
    "I'll just take a couple of these ones\nout of there",
    "and put it in this.",
    "Now what happens?",
    "Well, I think if I put this one\nfirst,",
    "it'll work out right.",
    "Why you put this in here for?",
    "I didn't put it in.",
    "I did, dear.",
    "I was just trying to help.",
    "Oh. Well, look, honey, whatever you\ngot left up there,",
    "just put it on the sidewalk",
    "and then when we're ready for you,\nwe'll fit it in, see?",
    "Okay. Oh, listen, Mother made\nsandwiches",
    "so we won't have to stop for lunch.",
    "Good!\tWell, thanks.",
    "10:00. We're four hours late already.",
    "Yeah.",
    "I'll get them all out of here.",
    "All right.\nAll right.",
    "You can put them down there.",
    "Okay. Do you think this will be\nenough lunch?",
    "Yes.",
    "This is a heavy one.",
    "Be careful with that.\t   Yeah.",
    "I'm going to get in here, Fred, and\nyou hand them to me. See...",
    "All right.",
    "Okay?\t What do you want first?",
    "Give me that big one, Fred.",
    "Yeah.\t\t    This?",
    "I got it. It's heavy.",
    "FRED: This one?",
    "Yeah. That's it.",
    "This is heavy, too.",
    "Careful with that.",
    "RICKY: Give me another one.\nThat one right there.",
    "Now what, the fat one?",
    "Yeah. Let's try the fat one there.",
    "And I'll put this...",
    "Watch-- now try it.",
    "Back in here, see?",
    "FRED: Now, what about this?",
    "(Ricky murmuring)",
    "That's it.",
    "That one...",
    "Got it?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Now, here's a little one, makeup kit.",
    "No spot for that?",
    "No. I got to take this one out.",
    "Turn that around the other way.",
    "That way.",
    "Next.\nUp with that.",
    "This one?",
    "Now.",
    "That little one will now fit in\nthere.",
    "Is that it?",
    "Yeah, that's done it.",
    "There.",
    "(exhaling)",
    "Okay.\nAy-ay-ay.",
    "(sighing)",
    "There we are.\nIsn't that great?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Ahh!",
    "What's all this junk?",
    "Are they crazy or something?",
    "Oh...",
    "Oh, no...",
    "Lucy, what's all this junk?",
    "Junk? This is all necessary stuff.",
    "ETHEL: Well, that's it, that's all.",
    "Well, we can't take all this stuff.",
    "We-we haven't got any more room.",
    "Well, make room!",
    "It's impossible.",
    "What do we do with it?",
    "Well, we'll have to live it here,\nthat's all.",
    "\"Live\" it here?\nWe need all this.",
    "(all talking over each other)",
    "(whistling)",
    "Wait a minute, will you?",
    "Now, I've been sizing this up",
    "and I think if we pack it all just\nright, we can make it.",
    "That's ridiculous.",
    "Why don't you let me try?",
    "Let him try.",
    "Okay, try.",
    "Now, Ricky, you go down in the\nbasement",
    "and bring me a nice piece of good,\nstrong rope.",
    "Okay, I'll get you the rope.",
    "What do you want us to do, Fred?",
    "Go on back in the house and relax,\nsit down!",
    "Get out of here!",
    "Okay.",

    "Give me that.",
    "Put that...",

    "Well... now I've seen everything.",
    "What's wrong with it?",
    "Well, for one thing,",
    "I can't see where I'm going.",
    "Oh, no, no. I figured that out, too.",
    "I left you a nice driving view",
    "right down through the middle here.",
    "Honestly, I could have loaded it\nbetter",
    "with a pitchfork.",
    "Our nice Pontiac.",
    "It looks like a laundry wagon.",
    "Yeah, well, you got to admit, I got\neverything in.",
    "Well, where are we going?",
    "(all complaining)",
    "FRED: Get in there. There's plenty of\nroom in there for...",
    "This is the most ridiculous thing\nI've...",
    "Wait a minute, wait a minute.",
    "Wait a minute, everybody.",
    "Listen to me.",
    "Did it ever occur to any of us",
    "that we could send this stuff on\nahead?",
    "Of course!",
    "What a bunch of jugheads we are!",
    "Sure, we'll be on the road two weeks.",
    "It'll get there before we do.",

    "for two whole weeks?",
    "Well, of course, Mother.",
    "It's 3,000 miles,",

    "Well, in that case, there's something\nyou ought to know.",
    "What?",
    "I get carsick.",
    "That's all, brother.",
    "That's all.",

    "Well, I had no idea it would take two\nweeks.",
    "It didn't look that far on the map.",
    "Oh, mother...",
    "I think I'll go by plane.",
    "Good!",
    "And I think little Ricky should go\nwith me.",
    "The baby?",
    "Gee, two weeks is a long time on the\nroad, Ethel.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Uh, it doesn't cost hardly anything",

    "What do you think, Ricky?",
    "I think it's a wonderful idea.",
    "I do, too. I think that's great.",

    "Whatever you do, don't let the cat\nout of the bag.",
    "Oh, don't worry.",
    "As far as he's concerned,",
    "we never even saw that item in\nVariety.",
    "And for heaven's sake, smile.",
    "Look happy or he'll know that\nsomething's wrong.",
    "Oh, hi, everybody.",
    "Hello, dear.",
    "Hi, Ricky.",
    "How are you?",
    "Hi, Rick, old boy.",
    "How's tricks? How's tricks?",
    "Hello, son.",
    "My, you're certainly all happy this\nmorning.",
    "Sure.",
    "Well, there's nothing to be sad\nabout.",
    "No. We didn't even see that item in\nVariety.",
    "What item?",
    "Oh, it's nothing, dear.\nIt was just a mention.",
    "It didn't say a thing about the\npicture being shelved. Oh!",
    "That cat wasn't let out of the bag.",
    "It was yanked out.",
    "What are you talking about?",
    "Oh, honey, it was just a little item\nin Variety",
    "about your picture being shelved,",
    "but it doesn't matter.",
    "Who wants to be in pictures anyway?\nFeh!",
    "Is that what you're worried about?",
    "Just one little item in the paper?",
    "Uh-huh.\nWell, honey,",
    "that's just publicity.",
    "Sure, you know, they want the people",
    "to keep talking about the picture.",
    "They'll do anything out here to keep\na picture alive.",
    "Even kill it?",
    "(chuckling)",
    "Sure. Look, if we weren't gonna make\nthe picture,",
    "don't you think I'd be the first one\nto know?",
    "Well, yeah, I suppose so.",
    "Of course, honey.\nThis afternoon",
    "I'm going to the studio to make some\ntests",
    "with the leading lady.\t     Oh?",
    "Now, they wouldn't be making tests",
    "if they were gonna cancel the\npicture.",
    "No, I guess not.",
    "Of course not.",
    "Oh, boy, am I relieved!",
    "Oh, thank goodness, my trip isn't\nruined.",
    "And I'll get to see Palm Springs\nafter all.",
    "LUCY: Yeah.\nDry those tears, Lana.",
    "(phone ringing)",
    "You should have asked me, then you\nwouldn't have been worried.",
    "Oh, boy.",
    "Hello?",
    "Yes, this is Ricky Ricardo.",
    "What?",
    "They are?",
    "Do you know why?",
    "You don't? I see.",
    "Yes, I'll be here.",
    "Thank you for calling.",
    "What's the matter, dear?",
    "Who was that?",
    "The studio.",
    "They're canceling the test this\nafternoon.",
    "Well... but why?",
    "They didn't say why.",
    "Oh, well, honey, that doesn't mean\nanything.",
    "Of course not.",
    "It's just publicity.\tSure.",
    "Yeah.",
    "They also said that Dore Schary",
    "wants to see me here tomorrow\nafternoon.",
    "I've heard that name before.",
    "Now, who's Dore Schary?",
    "Well, that's good, isn't it, honey?",
    "His wanting to see you here?",
    "No, that's bad.",
    "Who's Dore Schary?",
    "Oh, he's... he's someone at Metro,\ndear.",
    "Well, what does he do at Metro?",
    "Oh, he's a big shot.",
    "Well, just what does he do?",
    "Oh, he's the guy that twists the\nlion's tail",
    "when they want him to...",
    "(roaring)",
    "Oh, Fred!",
    "Well, honey...\nhoney, why is it bad?",
    "I don't understand.",
    "Well, don't you see, honey?",
    "When a big man like Mr. Schary's\ngonna come all the way out here,",
    "it must be just to make it nice while\nhe's firing me.",
    "Oh, dear.",
    "I guess he's right.",
    "Well, honey, don't you care.",
    "At least we got a trip to California\nout of it.",
    "Short as it was.",
    "Oh, Mother, please.",
    "Oh, I can't stand it anymore.",
    "I got to walk to the studio, find out\nwhat it's all about.",
    "Oh, well, you're right, dear.",
    "You demand to know.",
    "You're hardworking...\nall of a sudden they cancel.",
    "Yeah, I know, honey.",
    "I don't understand.",
    "Well, you have a right to know, dear.",
    "Oh, I could cry.",
    "He looked so disappointed.",
    "Poor Mickey.",
    "Aw, poor Ricky.",
    "If he just made one picture, I know\nthat the women of America",
    "would have gone absolutely mad about\nhis big, brown eyes.",
    "Yeah. That fan mail would have\nflooded the studio.",
    "Well, there's no use dreaming.",
    "That's it!",
    "Fan mail.",
    "Fan mail?",
    "Yeah. What do you think if all that\nflood of fan mail",
    "reached the studio by tomorrow\nmorning?",
    "I'll bet Dore Schary would think\ntwice about letting him go",
    "if the people of America were just\ndemanding",
    "to see more of Ricky Ricardo.",
    "More of him? He hasn't even been on\nthe screen yet.",
    "Who's gonna write him a fan letter?",
    "You got it.",
    "Lucy?",
    "Listen, everybody, the next hundred\nletters we write",
    "ask for Ricky's picture,",
    "and don't forget to change your\nhandwriting.",
    "Yeah, Fred, be sure and change your\nhandwriting",
    "or they'll think they're all from the\nsame person.",
    "I did change my handwriting.",
    "Look...",
    "I wrote the last hundred with my\nleft.",
    "Your left what? Foot?",
    "They'll think a chicken wants his\nautograph.",
    "Oh, come on, cut the gab.",
    "You're holding up the production\nline.",
    "Well, I'm going as fast as I can,",
    "but my hand's getting a cramp.",
    "Mine, too.",
    "Oh, for heaven's sake,",
    "we've only written 500 letters.",
    "Your hands can't be that cramped.",
    "Tell that to my hand.",
    "Oh, Ethel, you sure are a sissy.",
    "Well, haven't you got writer's cramp?",
    "No.",
    "Let me see your hand.",
    "Put down your pen.",
    "Now wiggle your fingers.",
    "Having a little trouble?",
    "Well, after all we have written 500\nletters.",
    "How about a little breather?",
    "Okay.",
    "Say,\t\t(sighing)",
    "why don't I take all these downstairs\nand mail them.",
    "Oh, that's a good idea, Mother.",
    "Oh, Lucy, my whole shoulder's sore.",
    "Me, too.\nI feel like",
    "I just pitched three games in the\nWorld Series.",
    "Well, now, remember, we're doing this\nfor Ricky's sake.",
    "You think 500 letters will do any\ngood?",
    "No, but 5,000 will.",
    "Oh, Lucy, I don't think I can make\nit.",
    "Now, don't forget, Ethel,",
    "if Ricky doesn't get into the movies,",
    "you don't get to stay in California.",
    "What's the good of staying in\nCalifornia,",
    "if I have to go around with my arm in\na sling?",
    "(phone ringing)",
    "Hello.",
    "He is?",
    "Did he see you, Mother?",
    "Okay, thanks.",
    "Ricky's on his way up from the lobby.",
    "Get rid of all the stuff.",
    "Oh, hide everything, Fred.",
    "Hide everything now.",
    "Ethel, hand me that ink well.",
    "Hurry up.",
    "(screaming): Oh!",
    "Fred, I'm sorry!",
    "What's the matter?",
    "Look, I slammed the drawer on your\nhand.",
    "Oh, how do you like that?",
    "It's so numb, I didn't even feel it.",
    "Oh, Fred...\nI'm sorry.",
    "Oh...\nYou all right?",
    "Gee, I'm sorry, Fred.",
    "Take a magazine.",
    "Just sit back and read it.",
    "LUCY: Oh, hi, dear.",
    "FRED AND ETHEL: Hi, Rick.",
    "Bueno, parece que ya se acabo todo.",
    "Oh, really?",
    "How were things at the studio, Rick?",
    "Did they shelve the picture?",
    "Yeah, they sure did.",
    "Oh...",
    "They can't do that to you.",
    "Well, they just did it.",
    "There's no doubt about it.",
    "Metro just gave me the door in the\nfence.",
    "What's that?",
    "Well, you ought to know, it's an\nAmerican 'spression.",
    "Are you sure that's an American\n'spression?",
    "Yeah. They gave me the door in the\nfence.",
    "Oh, they gave you the gate!",
    "That's what I said.",
    "I'm washed up. Finished.",
    "Did you see Mr. Schary today?",
    "No, but they're shoveling the\npicture.",
    "What if they do shovel it?",
    "Maybe they'll put you in another one.",
    "Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah.",
    "Maybe they're gonna use me",
    "in one of the Marx Brothers'\npictures,",
    "you know, Chico, Harpo, Groucho, and\nFloppo.",
    "Aw, honey, now, don't you worry.",
    "I have a feeling that the public will\nmake itself heard.",
    "What public?",
    "Yeah, well...",
    "Maybe I could borrow a couple hundred",
    "bobby-soxers from Sinatra.",
    "(mouthing words)",
    "(mouthing words)",
    "(no audio)",
    "This is Ricky Ricardo.",
    "Are you sure you haven't got any\ncalls for me",
    "from Mr. Dore Schary?",

    "Now, what do you think you're doing?",
    "Where's Dore Schary?",
    "He's not here yet.",
    "All right, back in the hall.",
    "Make another entrance.",
    "Now, just a minute, just a minute.",
    "Hold it, everybody.",
    "Nobody's gonna make another entrance\nanywhere.",
    "Well, don't you want us to help you?",
    "No!",
    "Good. I was gonna feel pretty silly\ntelling him",
    "I slept with your picture under my\npillow!",
    "(mirthless chuckle)",
    "No.",
    "Well, we only wanted to help you.",
    "Well, then get out of here.",

    "Oh, yes.",
    "Look, have I got my dates mixed up or\nsomething?",
    "Am I not supposed to have",
    "an appointment with Mr. Schary today?",
    "Why, yes. Isn't he there yet?",
    "No.",
    "Oh, he's probably still tied up",
    "at the Producer's Association meeting\nat the hotel.",
    "That's why he was gonna meet you\nthere.",
    "Oh.",
    "And he said he'd be back here by\n4:00.",
    "He has a very important appointment\nwith Mr. Stevens.",
    "Well, that's 25 minutes from now.",
    "Well, in that case, perhaps",
    "you'd better come out to the studio.",
    "Then you'll be sure to see him.",
    "Okay, I'll, I'll be right there.\nGood-bye.",
    "You can have your fan club meeting\nhere.",
    "I'm going to the studio.",
    "(giggling): Where...",
    "Oh, no!",
    "Where is Mickey Ricardo?",
    "Oh, brother!",
    "Hello. This is Dore Schary.",
    "May I have my office, please?",
    "Mr. Schary's office.",
    "Miss Ballantine, I won't be back at\nthe studio this afternoon.",
    "But what about your appointment with\nMr. Stevens?",
    "Oh, Mr. Stevens' is at the lunch",
    "and then we're having our meeting\nhere",
    "and then I'm going to drop in on\nRicky Ricardo.",
    "But Mr. Ricardo's on his way to the\nstudio.",
    "Well, uh, will you call him back,\nplease,",
    "and see if he's left yet?",
    "Yes, sir.",

    "(playing chords)",
    "(playing chords)",
    "I still say we should go right out\nthere",
    "and bust into Dore Schary's office.",
    "They wouldn't even let us through the\ngate.",
    "Oh...\n(phone ringing)",
    "Hello?",
    "This is Mr. Schary's secretary.",
    "Has Mr. Ricardo left yet?",
    "Oh, yes, he has.",
    "Oh, dear. Do you suppose you could\npossibly catch him?",
    "Mr. Schary still wants to meet him at\nthe hotel.",
    "Oh, yes, I can catch him.\nI'll call the garage.",
    "What's up?",
    "Dore Schary's coming here after all.",

    "Oh, no, I don't.",
    "Oh, Lucy, hurry up.",
    "He'll be gone in a minute.",
    "Yeah.",
    "What now, blue eyes?",
    "You know, maybe it's better",
    "if Ricky doesn't talk to Dore Schary\nright now.",
    "In his frame of mind,",
    "he'd probably say the wrong thing\nanyway.",
    "So?",
    "So, we can approach it",
    "from an entirely different angle.",
    "ETHEL: How?",
    "Suppose when Mr. Schary arrives,",
    "there's another big producer here",
    "just dying to get Ricky under\ncontract.",
    "Yeah.\nYeah.",
    "Now, where do we find somebody that\nlooks",
    "like a big, important producer?",
    "Oh, that's a tough one.",
    "Somebody who looks",
    "like a real important producer.",
    "(sputtering)",
    "Well, don't just stand there, Fred.",
    "Try to think of somebody.",
    "Well!",
    "Hey, the lobby's always full of\nactors",
    "and there're always a lot of them\naround the pool.",
    "Suppose we find one and pay him to do\nthe job?",
    "Great!\nNow wait a minute.",
    "I doubt if they'd take you seriously\nin that getup.",
    "Oh, that's right. Change and meet me\nback here right away.",
    "All right.",
    "Well, this meeting has been very\nhelpful, Dore.",
    "I'll get back to you in a day or two.",
    "Thank you, Jim.\nGood talking to you.",
    "Can I drop you at the studio?",
    "No, thanks.\nI have another engagement here.",
    "Fine. I'll see you.",
    "Bye.",
    "Would you ring the Ricky Ricardo\nsuite for me, please?",
    "Oh, honestly, you'd think there'd be\none actor",
    "in that lobby up there today,\nwouldn't you?",
    "There's always about two dozen\nhanging around.",
    "Boy, it's pretty discouraging.",
    "Well, there's none down here either.",
    "(sighing)",
    "(whispering): Lucy?",
    "What?",
    "What about him?",
    "Nah.",
    "Beggars can't be choosers.",

    "BOBBY: Hi, Mrs. Ricardo.",
    "Hi, Bobby.\nOh, hi, Bobby.",
    "Hey, Bobby, maybe you can help us.",
    "Sure. What can I do for you?",
    "Well, listen, Ricky's picture was\nshelved.",
    "Yeah, I know.\nI saw it in Variety.",
    "Yeah, well, Mr. Dore Schary is coming\nup to our apartment",
    "in a few minutes to have a little\ntalk with Ricky.",
    "Can I bring you up some ice water?",
    "I've never even seen Dore Schary.",
    "No, I'm afraid not, Bobby.",
    "There's gonna be too much going on.",
    "Now, look, I have a plan.",
    "I thought if we had another big\nproducer there",
    "that was just dying to put Ricky\nunder contract,",
    "then Mr. Schary wouldn't fire Ricky,\nsee?",
    "BOBBY: You know, you're right.",
    "These big producers always want you",
    "when somebody else wants you.",
    "Mm.\tWhat a bunch of eggheads.",
    "LUCY: Yeah.",
    "You can say that again.     Yeah.",
    "Well, you know where we can find an\nactor",
    "real quick that could play the\nproducer?",
    "We'll pay $10.",
    "Producer, huh?\nUh-huh.",
    "(clears throat)",
    "(pseudo British accent): Now, see\nhere, Dore,",
    "I simply must have Ricardo for my\nnext picture.",
    "Oh, no, Bobby, I'm afraid you're not\nthe type.",
    "I got shoes that make me four inches\nhigher.",
    "Four inches higher?",
    "How do you look?",
    "I look all right, but my ears pop.",
    "Oh, Bobby.",
    "LUCY: Thanks, anyway.",
    "Be sure and tell me if you see",
    "any producer-type actors around, huh?",
    "BOBBY: Yes, ma'am.",
    "Gee, we gotta find somebody and soon.\nCome on.",
    "Uh, pardon me.",
    "I couldn't help overhearing.",
    "Are you looking for an actor?",
    "Well, yes, I am.",
    "Well, I'm an actor.",
    "Well, I'm afraid you won't do.",
    "You see, we're looking for someone",
    "who looks like a producer.",
    "I've, uh... I've been told that I\nlook like a producer.",
    "You?",
    "(dismissive chuckle)",
    "The bellboy looks more like a\nproducer than you do.",
    "Now, Lucy, there's not much time",
    "and he is willing.",
    "Oh, I'm willing.",
    "Besides, I could use the ten bucks.",
    "Well, you're not exactly the type\nwe're looking for.",
    "Um, would you do it for $7.50?",
    "All right, it's a deal.",
    "Okay, come on.",
    "I don't usually work this cheap,",
    "but things are tough, what with\ntelevision and all.",
    "Yeah, I know, I know.",
    "Ethel?",
    "Oh, Lucy?",
    "Lucy.",
    "Well, Fred, we found one down by the\npool.",
    "Is that the best you could do?",
    "Well, we didn't have much choice.",
    "It was either him or the bellboy.",
    "He doesn't look like a producer.",
    "He's dressed all wrong.",
    "What's the matter with my clothes?",
    "Well, you just don't look like a\nproducer.",
    "You look like a banker or a\nbusinessman or something.",
    "Yeah, a real square.",
    "FRED: Yeah.",
    "Hey, maybe I got something in my\ncloset",
    "that'll sharpen him up a little.",
    "Hey, Fred, go get your sport coat.",
    "Right.",
    "Uh, now, listen, uh...\nuh, what's your name?",
    "Uh, Spelvin.\nGeorge Spelvin.",
    "Oh, well, listen, George.",
    "Here's the situation.",
    "Now, my husband Ricky Ricardo is\nunder contract to MGM.",
    "Was.",
    "Now, Ethel, we don't know.",
    "And Dore Schary is a big shot at MGM.",
    "Yes, I've heard of him.",
    "Yeah. Well, he's due here in a few\nminutes",
    "and we think he's going to fire\nRicky.",
    "Now, we want you to pretend",
    "that you're a big producer from\nanother studio",
    "and offer Ricky a contract.",
    "Well, do you think, uh,",
    "do you think Schary will go for a gag\nlike that?",
    "Well, why shouldn't he?",
    "Well, I hear he's pretty bright.",
    "Bright?",
    "If he's letting Ricky go, he's pretty\nstupid.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Oh.",
    "Well, uh, wouldn't he know all the\nother big producers in town?",
    "(gasps)",
    "Gee, that's right.",
    "Well, now, maybe he'd better be a\nproducer from back East",
    "or from Europe.",
    "A foreign producer.",
    "Can you do an accent?",
    "Not for $7.50.",
    "Well, let me hear your accent.",
    "I might go to ten dollars.",
    "(with Swedish accent): I just come\nhere from Sweden.",
    "I want to talk to Ricky Ricardo",
    "about making a picture for me in\nSweden.",
    "Back to $7.50.",
    "Well, I thought that was pretty good.",
    "Here's just the thing you need.",
    "Okay.",
    "Take off your coat, George.",
    "Oh, this is great.",
    "Okay.",
    "Put this on now.",
    "FRED: Now.",
    "There. Now he looks like a producer.",
    "FRED: Yeah.",
    "Yeah, that's more like it.",
    "Now... now, try to look important.",
    "Stand up straight.",
    "Hold in your stomach.",
    "I think he's the type that should be\nsitting down.",
    "Sit down.",
    "Now, get comfortable.",
    "Cross your legs.",
    "Now, try to say something in a real\ncultured tone of voice.",
    "Say, um...",
    "(with deep voice): Now, look here,\nDore.",
    "I want that very talented Ricky\nRicardo",
    "in a big musical I'm making.",
    "Now, look here, Dore.",
    "Ah, way down here.\nWay down here.",
    "Now, look here, Dore.",
    "Now, look here, Dore.",
    "I want that talented Ricky Ricardo",
    "for a musical...",
    "A big musical.",
    "A big musical I'm making.",
    "And money is no object.",
    "And m... and m...",
    "and I just can't bring myself to say\nthat.",
    "Listen, do you want the job or not?",
    "Well...",
    "Then say money is no object.",
    "And money is no object.",
    "What's the matter?",
    "It leaves a bad taste in your mouth,\ndoesn't it?",
    "Hi, everybody.",
    "Oh, hi, dear... Oh!",
    "Hi, dear.",
    "Uh... wel...\nHi, honey.",
    "RICKY: I'm sorry I'm late.\nI went to the studio.",

    "Dore Schary.",
    "Well?",
    "Well?",
    "Who... who...\nwho... who...",
    "Who... who...\nwho....",
    "What's the matter?\nYou sound like an owl.",
    "Who... who is he?",
    "Mr. Dore Schary.",
    "Uh, so long, Ricky.",
    "Nice being married to you.",

    "You want to come along?",
    "No. You go on, I got to get packed.",

    "Oh, I don't think that's very funny.",
    "Wait, ju-just a minute, dear.",
    "Hey, hey, you two.\nPlease, just a second.",
    "What'd you say, dear?",
    "I was saying that I'm at the studio,",
    "and I just sold the car.",
    "What? How are we gonna get home?",
    "On the train.",
    "Oh.",
    "You know, uh, the fellow I told you\nabout-- Ralph Berger--",
    "he paid me almost as much as I paid\nfor the car.",
    "And not only that, but by using the,\nuh, family travel plan,",
    "we can make money on the deal.",
    "Well, that sounds great.",
    "Are you gonna be home the rest of the\nafternoon?",
    "What?",

    "Well, I'm gonna have the tickets sent\nover right away.",
    "All right, dear. Good-bye.",
    "Guess what?",
    "Ricky sold the car.",
    "Sold the car?",
    "What are you talking about?",
    "Some fellow at the studio offered him",
    "practically what he paid for it, so\nhe sold it.",
    "Isn't that wonderful?",
    "Oh, yes, that's wonderful.",
    "That's just dandy.",
    "Well, you don't sound very pleased.",
    "I presume when Ricky sold the car,",
    "the back seat went with it?",
    "Well, naturally.",
    "What are you getting at?",
    "Well, we were rather attached to that\nseat.",
    "That's the way we came out here",
    "and that's the way we planned on\ngoing home.",
    "Is that what you're upset about?",
    "You'd be upset, too, if you just had\nyour back seat",
    "shot out from under you.",
    "Oh, Ethel, don't be silly.",
    "We're all going home on the train.",
    "You're going with us.",

    "Ricky says so.",
    "Quote, we're going home on the train,\nunquote.",
    "You're part of we.",
    "Messenger's on the way over here\nright now with the tickets.",
    "Yeah, but how many?",
    "One for you, one for Ethel, Ricky,\nmother and me.",
    "Five. The baby doesn't need any.",
    "(chuckling): Oh.",
    "I guess we were a little hasty,\nhoney.",
    "Good old Ricky wouldn't forget us.",
    "Well, of course not.",
    "Gee, the train!",
    "I haven't been on the train since I\nwas a little girl.",
    "Did they have trains then?",
    "Ho-ho.",
    "Gee, won't it be fun?",

    "Yes, and we made it.",
    "Come on, Fred.",
    "Now, Ethel, listen.",
    "Don't go away mad.",
    "Mad? Whatever gave you the idea we\nwere mad?",
    "Why, we're tickled to death.",
    "I think it's so thoughtful of Ricky",
    "to pick such a nice place as\nCalifornia to dump us in!",
    "Oh, Ethel.",
    "Oh...",
    "Hi, honey.",
    "What's the matter?\nYou mad because I'm late?",
    "No, I'm not mad because you're late.",
    "Well, did I do something?",
    "You sure did, buster.",
    "What did I did?",
    "Just think back over everything you\ndid this afternoon.",
    "Well, I went to the studio.",
    "I said good-bye to everybody.",
    "I sold the car.",
    "The guy that bought the car drove me\nhome,",

    "How many?",
    "Three.",
    "Only three?",
    "Yeah. The baby doesn't need one.",
    "One for your mother, one for you and\none for me.",
    "Oh, no.",
    "The Mertzes.",
    "Oh, yes, the Mertzes.",
    "What's the matter with you, Ricky?",
    "Well, I don't know.",
    "I was busy thinking of that travel\nfamily plan",
    "and try to save some money and the\ncar...",
    "They don't know anything about it, do\nthey?",
    "Oh, don't they. They were right here\nwhen the tickets arrived.",
    "Oh, dear. Are they mad?",
    "Well, let's put it this way:",
    "If I were you, I wouldn't walk ahead\nof them down a dark alley.",
    "Oh, well, now, this changes\neverything.",
    "You know, using that plan an-and only\nthree tickets,",
    "I made money on the deal, but now...",
    "Well, get them over here.",
    "We'll figure out something.",
    "Well, I should hope so.",
    "317, please.",
    "I don't know how could you forget\nthem.",
    "Well, honey, I got so many things on\nmy mind.",
    "The band and the whole thing...",
    "Checked out?",
    "That's impossible.",
    "317-- Mr. And Mrs. Fred Mertz.",
    "Oh, no!",
    "She said they checked out.",
    "They're down in the garage right now,\nshe said.",
    "What are they doing in the garage?\nThey don't have a car.",

    "All right.",
    "Oh, no! \tOh...",

    "Yes, on a motorcycle.",
    "Ethel, are you seriously considering",
    "going to all the way to New York on a\nmotorcycle?",

    "Come on, Fred.\nLet's go.",
    "Now, wait a minute, Ethel.",
    "We're all going home together.",
    "Ricky said he'd buy the tickets.\nDidn't you?",
    "Well, we'll figure out something.",

    "What's the matter?",
    "You step on the wrong gear?",
    "Yes, I step on the wrong gear.",
    "Well, what'd you want to do that for?",
    "Well, I thought it might be fun",
    "to back all the way to New York",
    "so we could see where we've been.",
    "Oh, I don't think",
    "this is any time to be funny, Fred.",

    "the main thing is, you're all right.",

    "Oh.",
    "Besides, she's stronger than I am.",
    "Oh, Fred...",
    "Well, she is.",
    "Hey, would it help if I rubbed your\nshoulder a little bit?",
    "Yeah, I guess so.",

    "Oh, that feels fine.",
    "Fred...\nYeah?",
    "I had a long talk with Ricky",

    "LUCY: What's the matter, girl?",
    "I pushed that piece of junk to three\ndifferent places",

    "Wouldn't they give you anything on\nit?",
    "Yep. I got this on it.",
    "A parking ticket?",
    "No. It's for \"dumping rubbish within\nthe city limits.\"",
    "Ethel, Ricky's going to buy",
    "your train tickets.",
    "After the things big mouth said to\nhim last night?",
    "Big mouth?",
    "I suppose I started it?",
    "Oh, now, Fred.",
    "He said he'd buy the tickets.",
    "Why didn't you leave well enough\nalone?",
    "Why should I get stuck for the price\nof a motorcycle?",
    "Because you smashed it.",

    "in the direction it was pointing in.",
    "Ethel, please.",
    "How did I know it was set in reverse?",

    "When I say he's wrong, he's wrong.",
    "Oh, Ethel.",
    "What are you doing over here anyway?",
    "Massaging his shoulder.",

    "such good friends--",
    "you taking his side and rubbing his\nshoulder?",
    "Why, Ethel, what's the matter with\nyou?",
    "Oh... we're stuck for the price of a\nmotorcycle",

    "in a million years.",
    "Oh, he will, too.",
    "Now, I'll show you how well I know\nRicky.",
    "I'll be right back.",

    "It is now that you've stuck your\nclaws into it.",
    "Here.",
    "Now, here's two of our tickets.",
    "Now, would I be giving you this",
    "if I wasn't sure that Ricky was gonna\nget some more?",
    "We'd be stuck.",

    "Thanks, Lucy.",
    "Yeah. 'Course I'm still stuck for the\nprice...",

    "No, I'm trying to keep from telling\nyou something.",
    "Tell what?",
    "Well, the Mertzes said that you\nwouldn't buy the tickets.",
    "I said you would. We got into a big\nfat argument,",
    "and... and... oh, dear.",
    "And I... I gave them two of our\ntickets.",
    "What?!",
    "Well, I didn't know the difference!",
    "They were just tickets.",
    "Well, these are just tickets, too.",
    "So, you take them over there",
    "and get my compartment back.",
    "I can't do that.",
    "Why not?",

    "Sure; I'm a sport.\nWhy not?",
    "There, you see!",
    "Oh, Lucy, we couldn't raise the money\nfor a trip to Europe.",
    "Ethel, you are not holding a positive\nthought.",

    "Well, let's see now.",
    "Boat fare, travel expenses,",
    "hotel, meal for the two of you--",
    "I'd say about $3,000.",
    "You see, all we got to do is scrape\nup $3,000?!",
    "Money found in overstuffed chairs and\nsofa cushions:",
    "$9.73.",
    "Money for sugar bowls: $29.25.",
    "Piggy banks: $28.16.",

    "What's G.T.H.P.?",
    "Going through husband's pants.",
    "Oh, yeah.",
    "Didn't you go through Fred's pants?",
    "Every pair, including his World War I\ncavalry britches.",
    "What did you get?",
    "A handful of lint and a Woodrow\nWilson button.",
    "Now, what does it all come to?",
    "Well, let's see.",
    "$200.16. Not bad, huh?",
    "Oh, great. Where will we get the\nother $2,800?",
    "How much do you get for selling\nblood?",
    "Oh, Lucy.",
    "What's wrong with that?",
    "You couldn't get $2,800 worth of\nblood",
    "out of a herd of elephants.",
    "Yeah, I guess you're right.",
    "Let's see, how can we take our $200",
    "and make it into $3,000?",
    "Yeah.",
    "How about the Irish Sweepstakes?",
    "Nah, the odds are too great.",
    "Yeah. What we need is a good local\nraffle",
    "where they're giving away two free\ntrips to Europe",
    "and we got all the tickets.",
    "Ha, ha! Yeah.",
    "Hey!\nWhy not hold our own raffle?",
    "What?",
    "The money we take in will pay for our\ntrip.",
    "Now, what can we raffle off?",
    "Your brain, for thinking up an idea\nlike that.",
    "No, no, no.\nNow, this is good.",
    "People are always raffling off things",
    "like automobiles, mink coats,\ntelevision sets.",
    "That's it. We could take our $200,\nbuy a television set",
    "and raffle it off.",
    "Well, I guess it would work at that.",
    "Sure it would.",
    "Only...",
    "Only what?",
    "Well, raffles are always held for\nneedy causes.",
    "Ethel, at this moment,",
    "you and I are the two neediest causes\nI can think of.",
    "Is it honest?",
    "It's a hundred percent honest.",
    "Look, we say we're gonna have a\nraffle.",
    "We sell tickets.",
    "Somebody who buys a ticket wins a\ntelevision set.",
    "What could be more honest than that?",
    "I guess it is.",
    "Sure it is. Now, all we have to do\nfor our needy cause",
    "is think up a good phony name.",
    "Let's see.",
    "I don't suppose we could call it",
    "two bundles for Britain?",
    "No. It has to sound real.",
    "How about...\nLadies Overseas Aid?",
    "Well...",
    "Look, we're ladies, we want to go\noverseas",
    "and, boy, do we need aid.",
    "Okay, Ladies Overseas Aid it is.",
    "Yes, ma'am.",
    "Who you gonna call?",
    "Mr. Feldman, the man who sold us our\ntelevision set.",
    "I thought maybe he could give us a\ngood price on one.",
    "FELDMAN: Hello?",
    "Mr. Feldman?",
    "Yes.",
    "This is Mrs. Ricky Ricardo, remember?",
    "Oh, yes.",
    "Is there something wrong with your\ntelevision set?",
    "Oh, no, no, it's fine.",
    "As a matter of fact, I want to buy\nanother one.",
    "Oh?",
    "Yes. We're, uh, trying to raise money",
    "for a needy cause, the Ladies\nOverseas Aid,",
    "and we want to raffle off a\ntelevision set.",
    "I see.",
    "I thought maybe you could give us a\ngood price on one.",
    "The Ladies Overseas Aid?",
    "Yes. It's a new group but very\nworthy.",
    "What aid do you give?",
    "Uh, well... just to, uh, pick a case\nat random from our files,",
    "at the moment, we're trying to raise\nmoney to send",
    "two dear little ladies to Europe to\nbe with their families.",
    "Aw, that's nice.",

    "I have an idea.",
    "I'll have your tickets printed for\nyou",
    "with my advertising on the back",
    "and then we can have the drawing in\nthe store here.",
    "Is that all right with you?",
    "Well, that is just perfect.",
    "We'll be down later to discuss",
    "the details with you, Mr. Feldman.",
    "And thank you very much.\nGood-bye.",
    "Europe, here we come!",
    "How about that!",
    "Oh, boy.",
    "I never knew 3,000 tickets weighed so\nmuch.",
    "Whoo!",
    "Honey, is that you?",
    "My gosh, Ricky's home.",
    "Quick, get ahold of those.",
    "Put them in there.",
    "Yeah, dear?!",
    "Okay.",

    "you had some time to play with the\nbaby.",
    "Well, I got to run along",

    "and very worthy organization,",
    "Ladies Overseas Aid.",
    "Oh, all right. How much?",
    "Oh, well, the tickets are a dollar\napiece.",
    "How many do you want?",
    "Well, honey, we've gone through this\nbefore.",
    "Let's save time, huh?",
    "I'll take all the tickets you have.",
    "Oh.",
    "All of them?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Wow!",
    "I think I've only got about ten left.",
    "All right, I'll take them.",
    "Okay.\nBoy, I'm getting off easy.",
    "I thought I was going to have to buy",
    "at least 20.",
    "20? Oh, well, let me take another\nlook.",
    "Oh, yeah, by George, I've got 20!",
    "Yeah, I've got 20. Here.",
    "As long as it is for a worthy cause.",
    "Oh, it is.",
    "I don't know when a cause has seemed\nso worthy to me.",
    "The need of those dear little ladies\njust gets me--",
    "right here.",
    "No, no, Marge, you don't have to be\nthere.",
    "Yeah, I'll let you know if you win,",

    "Thank you very much.",
    "I, uh, understand you're running a\nraffle today.",
    "Oh, yes, we are. Would you like to\nbuy a ticket?",
    "No. I'd just like to ask a few\nquestions about it.",
    "Oh. Oh, all right.",
    "Well, let's see now.",
    "Um, we're holding the drawing at\nFeldman's Appliance Store.",
    "The tickets are a dollar apiece.",

    "the Ladies Overseas Aid.",
    "(laughing): Oh... ha, ha!",

    "Ha, ha!",
    "We-we just made it up.",
    "Mrs. Ricardo, if you've been selling\ntickets",

    "A crime?\nOh, no, you don't understand.",
    "Anybody that buys a ticket",
    "buys a chance to win the television\nset.",
    "Someone will win the television set,",
    "so nobody gets hurt, right?",
    "Mrs. Ricardo, the people who bought\nthose tickets",
    "thought they were contributing to a\nreputable charity.",
    "Therefore, you've defrauded them.",
    "Now, fraud is a crime that's\npunishable",
    "by one to ten years in the\npenitentiary.",
    "But I'm going to Europe.",
    "I don't have time for ten years in\nthe penitentiary.",
    "No, you just may have to.",
    "Oh, but I didn't know it was a crime.",
    "I wouldn't have done it if I'd known",
    "it was a crime.",
    "I understand, Mrs. Ricardo.",
    "Now, look, here's what we can do.",
    "If you're willing to call off the\nraffle",
    "and give the money back, we'll forget\nthe whole thing.",
    "Well, I will. I will.",
    "Well, I certainly hope so,",
    "because once the drawing's actually\nheld,",
    "the matter is out of my hands,",
    "and we have to prosecute.",
    "Oh, I hope we can make it in time.",
    "The drawing is in 15 minutes.",
    "Lucy, I've come over to ask you...",

    "if we just went ahead without her.",
    "So, shall we? Let's do.",
    "Ha, ha, ha!",

    "Yeah, why not?",
    "Well, an affidavit is sworn\ntestimony.",
    "It's... it's testimony taken under\noath.",

    "But, Helen...",
    "Oh, I thought that said 1931.",
    "Helen?",
    "Yes, dear?",

    "Oh, oh, Daddy, you know, Lucy was a\nregular little mother.",

    "Ever since we've been married,",
    "she seems to be growing younger every\nday.",
    "Yeah, I guess it's the marriage that\ndid it.",
    "You've no idea how much younger she's\ngrown",
    "just since you walked into the room.",
    "Lucy, we don't want to keep you.",
    "If you want to run along...",
    "Look, Helen, I really need this\naffidavit.",
    "So, don't you think maybe you could\nsign it",
    "just for the sake of all those years\nthat I baby-sat with you?",
    "But that'd be perjury.",
    "Lucy, you wouldn't want Helen to lie,\nwould you?",
    "Oh, heaven forbid!",
    "Lucy, I hope you have a nice time in\nEurope.",
    "It was awfully nice to have met you,\nLucy.",
    "Yeah. Thanks.",
    "And maybe we'll see you soon?",
    "Oh, yes, you must come over for\ndinner sometime",
    "and bring your mother.",
    "Hi, honey, Dr. Peterson called, and\nhe's coming right over.",
    "Swell.",
    "What's the matter?",
    "I'll still need another witness.",
    "Why? What happened with Helen Kaiser?",
    "Helen Kaiser is a dirty rat.",
    "She wouldn't sign the affidavit.",
    "Her husband walked into the room",
    "and suddenly she became younger than\nI am.",
    "She wouldn't admit her real age.",
    "You're kidding.",
    "How do you like that?",
    "Oh, dear. What are you gonna do now?",
    "Well, I'll tell you one thing I'm not\ngoing to do.",
    "I'm not going to let you three trot\noff to Europe without me",
    "even if I have to stowaway.",
    "Oh, Lucy...",
    "You know, this is about the right\nsize at that.",
    "Oh, now, Lucy, not in that trunk!",
    "Why not?",
    "Well, how could you breathe?",
    "There's a hole in it.",
    "Yes, and it matches the one in your\nhead.",
    "Listen, if a seal could live in here,\nI can.",
    "Oh, dear.",
    "I'm just gonna try it on for size.",
    "Oh, Lucy, this is absolutely\nridiculous!",
    "It's a nice thing to sort of have\naround",
    "in case I can't get...",
    "Oh, honey...",
    "Now!",
    "I'm just gonna see if I fit in here.",
    "See? I fit like a glove.",
    "Yeah, but if the trunk was closed,",
    "you wouldn't last two minutes.",
    "Oh, I would, too.",
    "Go ahead, close it.\nI'll show you.",
    "Okay, but just to convince you.",
    "Ethel, now, let me get my skirt out\nof the way.",
    "Got it?",
    "Yep.",
    "Okay.",
    "How's that?",

    "I'll say you couldn't.",
    "Although... maybe I could find some\nballet tights",

    "Well, can't you just tell him",
    "that you changed your mind?\nYes.",
    "Well, honey, buying a house is not\nlike buying a dress.",
    "You just can't call up the guy",
    "and say \"I don't like the color.\"",
    "Well, you could tell him",
    "it doesn't fit.\nYes.",
    "All right, all right, I'll call him\nfirst thing in the morning",
    "and see what I can do.",
    "Oh, thank you, honey.\nOh, Ricky!",
    "Are you sure you won't change your\nmind again?",
    "I'm positive, honey.",
    "I never want to live any other place\nas long as I live.",
    "All right.",
    "I just want to be right here.",
    "Okay. Okay.",
    "Women-- you can't live with them,",
    "but I guess it'd be pretty hard to\nlive without them.",
    "Well, it might be worth a try.",
    "Well, I know, I know, Mr. Spaulding,",
    "but you see, well, my wife changed\nher mind",
    "and I thought that maybe we could...",
    "Sure.",
    "Yes, sir, uh-huh.",
    "All right, sir. Good-bye.",
    "What did he say?",
    "Is he gonna give you your deposit\nback?",
    "He said absolutely not.",
    "A deal is a deal.",
    "Oh, dear.",
    "You mean you have to move to the\ncountry",
    "whether you want to or not?",
    "No. But if I don't buy the house, I\nlose $500.",
    "Well, I don't think that's very nice\nof Mr. Spaulding",
    "not giving you your money back.",
    "Well, honey, on the strength of us\nbuying his house,",
    "he bought another house down the\nroad,",
    "so you can't blame him for holding us\nto the deal.",
    "I sure wouldn't be as calm as you are",
    "if I were losing $500.",
    "If you were losing $500, you'd be\nfoaming at the mouth.",
    "Well, I guess that's that.",
    "Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.",
    "It's all my fault.",
    "Maybe... maybe you could take it out\nof my allowance",
    "for the next 50 years.",
    "I have to go to the club, honey.",
    "I'll talk to you when I come home.\nGood-bye.",
    "Bye, Rick.\nBye.",
    "So long, Rick.",
    "Oh, gee.",
    "There must be some way to get that\n$500 back.",
    "Fred, you know about real estate and\nthings.",
    "Isn't there some way that we can make\nMr. Spaulding",
    "give, um, give that deposit back?",
    "Well, I don't know.",
    "Unless you could fix it some way",
    "to make him think you're undesirable,",
    "and he didn't want you to have the\nhouse.",
    "Hey, that's a good idea.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Now, let's think.",
    "How can we do that?",
    "We?",
    "How did we get in on this?",
    "Well, for heaven's sake, Ethel,",
    "You and Fred are the reason that I\ndon't want to move.",
    "The least you can do is help me out\nof this fix.",
    "Oh, you're right.",
    "Let's see now.",
    "How can we be undesirable?",
    "That shouldn't be hard for you,\nEthel.",
    "Never mind now.",
    "Just think.",
    "Oh, there, there, Eleanor.",
    "I can't help it, Gerald.",
    "Moving out of this house after 30\nyears.",
    "Well, we're not moving to the North\nPole, my dear.",
    "We'll be living right down the road.",
    "Oh, it won't be the same.",
    "Oh, maybe you should give the\nRicardos their money back.",
    "Now, Eleanor, a deal is a deal.",
    "And don't forget, we both agreed",
    "now that the children are married,",
    "we don't need this big house.",
    "That's right.",
    "Oh, I do hope they're nice people",
    "and will take care of it.",
    "They seem like very nice people.",
    "Well, you never can tell, dear.",
    "Remember, they're in show business.",
    "Oh, now, Eleanor, we mustn't be\nnarrow-minded.",
    "Some of them are all right.",
    "I suppose so.",
    "Oh, I'll, uh, I'll see who that is.",

    "So what I think I'll do is",

    "Yes, I know. I know.",
    "What's the problem, Fred?",
    "Well, the Taylors will, uh, move in",
    "only if they can have the apartment\nright away.",
    "Tomorrow.\nYeah.",
    "Oh, that's impossible!",
    "We can't get into our house for four\nmore days.",

    "Yeah, so?",
    "Do you know how much I saved you",

    "So that's what you sat up all night\nfiguring!",
    "Yep.",
    "Well, Fred, that's very nice of\nyou,",
    "but we can't possibly move out so\nfast.",
    "Listen, I'm saving you almost 150\ngrand.",
    "The least you could do would be to\nmove out",
    "a couple of measly days ahead of\ntime.",
    "Now, just a minute, Fred!",

    "anyone was foolish enough to want to\nbuy it.",
    "We can buy all-new furniture.",
    "Now just a minute, just a minute.",
    "Do you realize how much money it will\ncost",
    "to furnish that whole new house with\nnew furniture?",
    "Are you gonna quibble about a few\nsticks of furniture",
    "when you just made $150,000?",
    "No... no.",
    "All right.",
    "I know when I'm licked.",
    "Come on, honey.",

    "This is what?",
    "I'll never see this apartment again.",
    "Oh, now, let's not get sentimental.",
    "It's... just another apartment.",
    "Just another apartment?",
    "There's 15 years of memories here.",
    "Yeah, I know.",
    "Do you remember the day I got locked\nin the trunk",
    "right there?",
    "Remember the day",
    "we were redecorating the apartment",
    "and you wallpapered me into the\ncloset?",
    "How about the day the pressure-cooker\nexploded?",
    "It took us two days",
    "to get the chicken fricassee off the\nceiling!",
    "Ooh, I've got to cut this out.",
    "I haven't cried so much since the day\nI got married.",

    "this is the inventory-- here.",
    "Oh, thank you, thank you.\nI'll go over it",
    "and I'll give your husband a check\nthis afternoon.",
    "Well, we'll be in the apartment",
    "across the hall if you want to see us\nabout anything.",
    "We sure do appreciate",
    "your selling us the furniture.",
    "Saved us a lot of expense and\ntrouble.",
    "Well, we were glad to do it.",

    "as happy as we've been.",

    "Oh.",
    "Well, um...",
    "this, uh, this shade was made\nespecially for this lamp,",

    "It's very nice, but I really think",

    "Oh.",
    "Uh, would you mind terribly",

    "Yes, Betty.",
    "Do you remember I told you it wasn't\nright",

    "We... we just don't think we\nshould...",

    "Yeah, well...",
    "You know, Betty, now that I see all\nthis furniture here,",
    "I don't think it suits the house.",
    "Doesn't suit it?",
    "It's an early American house.",
    "This is early American furniture.",

    "Say what?",
    "You don't like my taste.",
    "Oh, no, Betty, I didn't mean that.\nNo.",

    "Oh, dear.",
    "Oh, dear.",
    "What's the matter?",
    "Betty Ramsey was just here.",

    "Hello, Fred.\nHow are you?",
    "Did you get the egg crates and the\nfeed?",
    "Well, I got the feed, but no egg\ncrates.",
    "Why not?",
    "Well, I don't know just how to tell\nyou this, Rick.",
    "Tell me what?",
    "Well, you remember, I told you the\nchickens",
    "started to lay when they were six\nweeks old?",
    "Yeah?",
    "I made a slight miscalculation.",
    "Mr. Corwyn tells me it's six months.",
    "What?",
    "Oh, brother.",
    "No wonder those little chicks looked\nso wild-eyed",
    "when I put them on the nest and said,\n\"Come on, give.\"",
    "I thought you were raised on a farm",
    "and you knew all about chickens.",
    "So I made one little mistake.",
    "One little mistake, he says.",
    "You know, that one little mistake of\nyours,",
    "puts me in a bad spot.",
    "I was depending on the money from the\neggs",
    "to help pay the expenses around here.",
    "Yeah, I know, Rick, and I'm sure\nsorry.",
    "It doesn't make me want to jump for\njoy, either.",
    "Oh, brother.",
    "Well, listen, partner, this puts a\nwhole new light",
    "on our business arrangement.",
    "What do you mean?",
    "Well, I mean, we were going to share\nthe profit",
    "from selling the eggs, right?",
    "Right.",
    "In return I was gonna do",
    "all the work around here for nothing,\nright?",
    "Right.",
    "Well, now there won't be any profits.",
    "So until the chickens start laying",
    "I think you ought to pay me a salary,\nright?",
    "Wrong.",
    "How do you figure?",
    "Well, now, look, Fred.",
    "I'm not making any money out of the\neggs.",
    "In the meantime, you're living in the\nguest house for nothing,",
    "so until the chickens start laying,",
    "I figure you should pay me rent.",
    "Rent?!",
    "Yeah, you know, that little thing\nthat I used to pay you",
    "the first of every month for 16\nyears?",
    "Now, look...",
    "Now, wait, you two, don't get into a\nsnit.",
    "Now just maybe we don't have to wait\nso long",
    "to have some profits.",
    "What are you talking about?",
    "Well, why couldn't we trade in those\nbaby chicks",
    "for some full-grown hens",
    "that would start laying eggs right\naway?",
    "Yeah, that way you'd have your\nprofits",
    "and you'd have your income.",
    "Now we're getting someplace.",
    "I've got to hand it to you, Lucy.",
    "Yeah, honey, that's a good idea.",
    "Yeah, I've done it again.",
    "Again?\nAgain?",
    "Don't knock it, just be glad I did it\nthis once.",
    "Look, Fred, let's go over to the\nhatchery,",
    "and see what kind of a deal we can\nmake with that fellow.\nRight.",
    "Let's go out and say good-bye to our\nbaby chicks.",
    "Oh, yes, that's a great idea.\nIsn't that a good idea?",
    "There's nothing like growing your own\nbreakfast, huh, Ethel?",
    "Mm, boy, I'll say, these are so\nfresh.",
    "Mommy, did our chickens lay these\neggs?",
    "Yes, dear.",
    "Our nice, new, big chickens.",
    "Now, what's the matter now?",
    "I tell you what's the matter!",
    "Fred botched it again.",
    "What are you talking about?",
    "You told me that each one of those\nhens",
    "was supposed to lay one egg every\nday.",
    "Right?",
    "Well, they've been here for a whole\nweek",
    "and all we've gotten is six lousy\neggs.",
    "What do you expect me to do, squeeze\nthe eggs out of them?",
    "Well, you're the expert, do\nsomething.",
    "I've done everything but jump up and\nsit in the nest with them.",
    "Oh, now, honey, don't get all upset.",
    "Maybe the reason the chickens aren't\nlaying",
    "is because they're nervous.",
    "Nervous? What have they got to be\nnervous about?",
    "Wouldn't you be nervous if someone\nwas standing around",
    "waiting for you to lay an egg?",
    "Yeah, Rick, it's their new\nsurroundings.",
    "As soon as they get to feeling at\nhome,",
    "I bet they'll drop eggs",
    "so fast we'll have to jump out of the\nway.",
    "She's right, Rick.",
    "I hope they start feeling at home\nsoon.",
    "Well, anyway, we're getting",
    "our breakfast for nothing.",
    "For nothing?",
    "Listen, with the cost of the feed,",
    "the money that I spent fixing the\nhenhouse,",
    "the extra heat and electricity",
    "and the money lost by switching",
    "the 500 baby chickens for the 200\nhens,",
    "I figured out each one of those\nbreakfasts",
    "is costing $18 apiece.",
    "Eww.",
    "Yeah, \"eww.\"",
    "Listen, I'll tell you what I'm going\nto do.",
    "I'm going to give those hens one more\nday.",
    "Now, if by tomorrow they don't start\nlaying regularly",
    "I'm gonna sell the whole bunch of\nthem",
    "and get out of the egg business.",
    "I can take a hint.",
    "Come on, Ethel, let's start packing.",
    "Oh, now, Fred...\nOh, now, Fred...",
    "Hold on, you got one more day.",
    "Yeah, now, Fred, instead of packing,",
    "maybe you'd better get out there",
    "to that chicken house",
    "and give those hens a pep talk.",
    "Yeah, why don't you try scaring them?",
    "Walk through the hen house with a\nsign that says:",
    "\"Fryers for sale.\"",
    "Sure, sure.",
    "Well...",
    "I'll help him.",
    "Yeah, you go help Uncle Fred, huh?",
    "Chickens.",
    "I should have raised something I knew\nabout, like sugar cane.",
    "Oh, dear.",
    "Oh, Lucy, this is awful.",
    "The boys at each other's throats,",
    "the chickens aren't cooperating.",
    "What are we going to do?",
    "I don't know, but don't give up, we\ngot one more day.",
    "You don't expect those hens",
    "to lay a bumper crop of eggs\novernight?",
    "You know, they could if we helped\nthem.",
    "Lucy, I've never laid an egg in my\nlife",
    "and I refuse to start trying now.",
    "No, I don't mean that,",
    "I mean buy some, maybe about five\ndozen.",
    "Take them out to the henhouse, put\nthem in the nest,",
    "and let Fred and Ricky discover them.",
    "What good would that do?",
    "It'll only delay the inevitable one\nmore day.",
    "Well, in the meantime maybe our hens\nwill warm up",
    "and our men will cool down.",
    "It's worth a try.",
    "Well, so far, so good.",
    "Where's Ricky?",
    "He went into New York.\nHow about Fred?",
    "He's taking a nap.",
    "How do you know that?",
    "It's after lunch and before dinner.",
    "What else would he be doing?",
    "I guess you're right.",
    "Well, get your eggs and let's get out\nthere.",
    "All righty.",
    "Uh-oh.",
    "What's the matter?",
    "Your sleeping prince, he's out by the\nhenhouse chopping wood.",
    "He's supposed to be taking a nap.",
    "Can't he ever do anything right?",
    "Well, now what will we do?",
    "We'll just have to wait till he\nfinishes chopping wood.",
    "He'll probably be out there all\nafternoon.",
    "We got to get these in the nest\nbefore Ricky comes home.",
    "Well, what'll we do?",
    "We'll just have to stash them on us\nsomeplace",
    "and just walk casually by Fred.",
    "We can't stash away five dozen eggs.",
    "Well, we can give it a try.\nHere, open them up.",
    "What are you going to do?",
    "Well, I'm going to put some in my\nblouse.",
    "I can get some in my hip pockets,\ntoo.",
    "Be careful.",
    "Want me to help you?",
    "No, let's see, now.",
    "Ooh, you have to be awful careful.",
    "Yeah, this...",
    "Oh, oh...",
    "What's the matter?",
    "Whoo, they're cold.",
    "I wonder how the chicken stands it.",
    "Hey, I can get a dozen in one pocket.",
    "Yeah, I'm doing all right, too.",
    "Don't break them, don't break them,\nbe careful.",
    "No, just sounded like it.",
    "Just precious.",
    "We'll make it.",
    "Three dozen?",
    "I haven't broken one yet.",
    "How do I look?",
    "Oh, you look kind of lumpy.",
    "Maybe I better put my jacket on.",
    "Yeah, want me to help you?",
    "I can do it.",
    "I'll help you, honey.",
    "Wait a minute, I got one more egg to\ngo.",
    "Now, how's that?",
    "Oh, that looks fine.",
    "How do I look?",
    "Well, whatever you do",
    "don't try to walk like Marilyn\nMonroe.",
    "Oh, we got to get rid of these\ncartons.",
    "Put them all in here",
    "and I'll put them away there in the\nfirebox.",
    "I'll get it, I'll get it.",
    "Want me to help you?",
    "Easy, now, I can't...",
    "Lucy.",
    "Hi, honey.",
    "Why, I thought you were in New York.",
    "Well, I decided to take the late\ntrain",
    "because I want to rehearse our\nnumber.",
    "Rehearse?",
    "Oh, the act's just fine, honey.",
    "We don't want to get over-rehearsed.",
    "Well, I wouldn't worry about that if\nI were you.",
    "Come on, I haven't got much time,\nit's either now or never.",
    "Well, then make it never?",
    "Look, honey, if we're going to do the\ndance",
    "in front of all those people",
    "I want to do it right.",

    "Now, Ethel...\nHuh?",
    "Wait a minute.",
    "Stick around, I want you to see--",
    "you know, tell us what it looks like.",
    "Come on, come on.",
    "Come on, honey.",
    "What's the matter?",
    "Honey, if we're gonna dance for the\nP.T.A.,",
    "we should be dignified.",
    "We should stand at least two feet\napart.",
    "To tango?",
    "Yeah, well, you were right.",
    "We don't want to get the school\nraided.",
    "Come on, honey, if we're going to\ntango, let's tango, eh?",
    "Lucy!",
    "That's enough, honey...",
    "Come on, I want to do the finish.",
    "The finish?",
    "Yeah.",

    "on their apartment.\nOh.",
    "Say, about the tickets now,",
    "are you sure you know where they are?",
    "Yes, honey, I'm sure.",
    "I put them in my dresser drawer",
    "in my jewel box with my good jewelry",
    "six months ago.",
    "All right. And you won't forget to\nbring them with you?",
    "Well, I thought I'd throw them in the\nwastebasket",
    "just before I left the house.",
    "Oh, my. Oh, my.",
    "I'm just checking.",
    "And you're sure you got the right\ndate?",
    "Yes, honey, I'm sure I have the right\ndate.",
    "I put a ring around the date on the\ncalendar.",
    "I made a mental note of it.",
    "I entered it my engagement book.",
    "I did everything but hire an elephant",
    "and tie a string around its trunk.",
    "Yeah, but are you sure you got the\nright date?",
    "Oh, honestly, Ricky, just this once,",
    "can't you give me credit for doing\nsomething right?",
    "All right, now, now, don't get so\ntouchy.",
    "Well, honestly.\nWell, you know how you are.",
    "No. How am I?",
    "Well, to tell you the truth, you're a\nlittle...",
    "Oh, now, come on.",
    "Really!",
    "Okay, okay, I trust you.",
    "Well, thanks a lot.",
    "Listen, don't forget that Fred and I",
    "are gonna meet you and Ethel at\nMeegham's Chop House.",
    "Okay.",
    "7:30.",
    "Yes, dear.",
    "And be on time.",
    "Yes, dear.",
    "And don't go crazy, shopping in all\nthe stores.",
    "No, dear.",
    "Bye.",
    "Good-bye, dear.",
    "Sheesh!",
    "Ethel, isn't it fun being in town for\nan evening?",
    "Ooh-huh.",
    "Would you ladies care to order now?",
    "Well, uh, we're waiting for our\nhusbands,",
    "but, uh, we do we have to get to the\ntheater,",
    "so maybe we'd better order something",
    "that doesn't take too long, huh?",
    "What's ready?\nThe roast beef's ready.",
    "Well, how's that for you?",
    "Oh, that's fine.",
    "All right, uh, four roast beefs,\nmedium,",
    "with, uh, mashed potatoes and lima\nbeans.",
    "Oh, lima beans.\nOkay.",
    "Very well.",
    "Oh, Lucy, just think,",
    "we're gonna go to the theater\ntonight.",
    "How about that?",
    "Where are we sitting?",
    "Sixth row, center.\nDownstairs.",
    "Let me see the tickets.",
    "I'd just like to hold mine for a\nwhile.",
    "Oh, you silly.",
    "I'll put them in my memory book.",
    "Now, Lucy, don't tell me you forgot\nthem.",
    "No, I did not forget them.",
    "Nobody seems to trust me anymore.",
    "Here they are.",
    "There you are-- row F, seats 104, 5,\n6 and 7.",
    "What's the matter?",
    "What time is it, Ethel?",
    "It's, uh, 7:40.",
    "Why?",
    "Too late for the matinee, huh?",
    "Matinee?!",
    "Oh, no!",
    "Oh, Lucy, how could you?!",
    "Well, I wrote for the best seats on\nthe first available Saturday.",
    "I forgot all about the matinee.",
    "Oh, of all the dumb tricks.",
    "Well, at least I didn't lose them,",
    "you'll have to admit that.",
    "Well, bully for you.",
    "Maybe we can get four more seats at\nthe box office.",
    "Oh, you know this show's been sold\nout for six months.",
    "Gee, it's too bad we didn't have\ntickets to a stinker.",
    "What am I gonna tell Ricky?",
    "I don't know, but you'd better think\nfast.",
    "Look, I'm gonna stall.",
    "Stall? What good would that do?",
    "Well, you know, he hates to get to\nthe theater late,",
    "so I'll, I'll take a long time eating\nmy dinner and,",
    "and, and then we'll miss the first\ncurtain, see,",
    "and then I'll say that oh, I heard\nthat",
    "the show was overrated,",
    "and I really don't want to go anyway.",
    "Yeah.\nAnd you be sure and say...",
    "Oh, hi, Ricky.\nHi.",
    "Hi, honey.\nHi.",
    "Sorry, I'm late. My taxi got stuck in\nthe traffic.",
    "Oh.\nWhere's Fred?",
    "Oh, um, I don't know.",
    "I guess he's still collecting the\nrent money",
    "at the apartment building.",
    "10:30 in the morning till 7:30 at\nnight?",
    "Well, collecting the rent money",
    "is the highlight of the month to\nFred,",
    "and he likes to linger over it.",
    "Well, I guess we'd better order.",
    "We haven't got much time.",
    "Oh, uh, I already ordered, dear, four\nroast beefs.",
    "Oh, that was a good idea.",
    "Yeah, I, uh, I thought roast beef was\na good idea",
    "at the time, but now I don't know.",
    "Steak might be nice, or, uh, maybe\nsome broiled chicken.",
    "What do you think about broiled\nchicken, Ethel?",
    "Oh, uh, uh...",
    "Well, I like broiled chicken.",
    "'Course, steak sounds very good, too.",
    "Maybe we should have some seafood.",
    "What month is this?\nIs there an \"r\" in it?",
    "Uh...",
    "What's the matter with you two?",
    "You know we haven't got time to\nchange our order.",
    "Roast beef is fine.",
    "Oh, here's Fred.",
    "Hi, Fred.",
    "Oh, hiya, Fred.",
    "Are they still following me?",
    "Who?",
    "Oh, here we go again.",
    "Every time Fred has more than $10 in\nhis pocket,",
    "he imagines the entire underworld is\ntrailing him.",
    "Pipe down, will you, Ethel?",
    "I got $500 cash in this pocket,",
    "and two guys followed me from the\nsubway station.",
    "Well, if you're so nervous, why\ndidn't you take a taxi?",
    "I may be nervous, Ethel, but I'm not\npanicky.",
    "Fred, are you really carrying $500 on\nyou?",
    "Shh! Do you want to get me bumped\noff?",
    "Look, Fred, if you're that worried,",
    "I'll keep it for you in my wallet.",
    "No, thanks.\nI want a safe place.",
    "A place no holdup man would ever\nthink of looking.",
    "Oh, well, then put it in my purse.",
    "Even I wouldn't think of looking\nthere.",
    "Hey, that's a good idea.",
    "His money belt is at the laundry.",
    "Say, Fred, we ordered roast beef for\nyou.",
    "Is that all right?",
    "That's swell. Thanks.",
    "Okay.",
    "Wanted to save time, you know.",
    "Yeah... good.",
    "This is great.",
    "Yeah, looks good.",
    "Mm-hmm.",
    "Mmm.",
    "Good roast beef.",
    "Mmm.",
    "What's the matter, honey, why aren't\nyou eating?",
    "Oh, I'm just waiting for my meat to\ncool off.",
    "It's not too hot, dear, it's just\nright.",
    "Well, they say hot food is bad for\nthe stomach.",
    "Who said that?",
    "I just did. Didn't you recognize my\nvoice?",
    "Come on, come on.",
    "Stop fooling around and eat your\nfood.",
    "We got to go to the theater.",
    "What are you doing?",
    "Will you please tell me what you are\ndoing?",
    "Chewing.",
    "I know that, but we have to get to\nthe theater.",
    "Can you chew any faster?",
    "Well, then go ahead.",
    "Why not?!",
    "I read somewhere that",
    "you should chew your food 25 times\nbefore swallowing.",
    "Well, swallow it now and chew it\nlater.",
    "People should chew their food\nthoroughly",
    "like animals do.",
    "Animals don't have to make an 8:30\ncurtain.",
    "Are you all right, Ethel?",
    "Yes. Why?",
    "Well, usually by now you've gobbled\nyour dinner",
    "and devoured half of mine.",
    "Well, I just decided",
    "to eat like the animals do, too.",
    "Just decided?",
    "You've been eating like a horse for\n20 years.",
    "I also read where you should peel\nlima beans",
    "to get the most out of them.",
    "Lucy...",
    "Yes, you see, all the vitamins are\nunder the upper epidermis.",
    "Lucy, what's up?",
    "Nothing's up.\nI just think that it's,",
    "it's much better to be healthy than\nto see an old show.",
    "Aha!",
    "You forgot the tickets!",
    "No, no. No, I didn't forget the\ntickets, did I, Ethel?",
    "No, no, she, she didn't forget the\ntickets.",
    "See? Here they are.",
    "Then what's the matter?\nWhat's wrong?",
    "Well...",
    "Oh, no.",
    "Oh, oh, no!",
    "What? What?",
    "These tickets are for the matinee.",
    "For today's matinee.",
    "Don't tell me that.",
    "Honey, maybe we can get some more\ntickets at the box office.",
    "How can get some more tickets?",
    "I asked you, \"Have you got the\ntickets?",
    "And you're sure you got the right\ndate?\"",
    "You said, \"I put them in my jewel\nbox. Oh, sure...\"",
    "Look, the sign says \"Sold Out.\"",
    "Let's stop this foolishness and go\nhome.",
    "Oh, now, Fred, it never hurts to try.",
    "We're in luck.",
    "He got 'em!",
    "Cancellations.\nRight in front.",
    "This fellow just turned them in.",
    "Oh, honey, that's wonderful.",
    "See, we see the show after all.",
    "Wait a minute.\nWait a minute now.",
    "I only got two tickets.",
    "Two?",
    "Well, we were lucky to get these.",
    "These are box seats.\nThat's all they got.",
    "Only two, huh?",
    "Just two?",
    "I'm afraid so.",
    "Oh.",
    "Well, um, which two of us are gonna\nget to see the show?",
    "Well, it's my fault that we missed\nthe matinee,",
    "so you two go.",
    "No, Lucy.",
    "You've been counting on this for\nmonths. You go.",
    "Oh. Well, no, I don't deserve to go.",
    "You take the tickets.",
    "Okay, we'll go.",
    "Oh...",
    "How come you get to go?",
    "I'm the one that's been counting on\nthis for months.",
    "Well, you just said we should go.",
    "Well, I didn't think you'd take me up\non it.",
    "Well, the show's starting.\nSomebody'd better go.",
    "Well, who?",
    "Well, look, to make it really fair,",
    "why don't two of us see the first\nhalf of the show,",
    "and then the other two will see the\nlast half.",
    "Yeah, that's a good idea.",
    "Yeah, okay. Which two of us will go\nfirst?",
    "Why don't you two go first.",
    "Oh, no.",
    "All right, then we'll two, we'll go\nfirst.",
    "Oh, no.",
    "All right, then you two girls go\nfirst.",
    "Oh, fine.\nYeah, we'll see you here.",
    "All right, all right.",
    "Have a good time.",
    "Oh, it doesn't really matter.",
    "They can fill us in on what happened.",
    "Sure.",
    "I wonder what the story's all about?",
    "The\nguy is not married.",
    "How you know that?",
    "Look at the title.",
    "Standing on the corner",
    "Watching all the girls go by",
    "Standing on the corner",
    "Underneath the springtime sky",
    "Brother, you can't go\nto jail for what you're thinking",
    "Or for the ooh...\nlook in your eye",
    "You're only standing on the\ncorner",
    "Watching all the girls, watching all\nthe girls",
    "Watching all the girls",
    "Go by.",
    "Oh, Ethel, isn't it marvelous?",
    "Oh, that Frank Loesser music is just\ngreat.",
    "Too bad we can't see the rest of it.",
    "Sure is.",
    "Hey, maybe we can see the rest of it.",
    "Oh, now, Lucy, we promised the\nfellas.",
    "No, look, these people didn't show up\nfor the first act.",
    "Well, maybe they're still coming to\nsee the show.",
    "Oh, Ethel, do you know anyone who's\nmissed the whole first act",
    "and still wants to see the show?",
    "Sure, Ricky and Fred.",
    "Besides them.",
    "Look, here's what we'll do.",
    "We go out and give the tickets to the\nfellas,",
    "and after they come back into the\ntheater,",
    "we'll just stroll back in with the\ncrowd.",
    "Oh, how could we do a thing like\nthat?",
    "We still got our programs in our\nhands. Nobody'll stop us.",
    "Just look innocent, you know.",
    "Never mind. Just stay behind me. I'll\nhandle it.",
    "I said look innocent.",
    "The boss has treated you\npretty good, Joey.",
    "Yeah...",
    "Hi.",
    "Hi.",
    "Hi. How'd you get in here?",
    "We just strolled in with the crowd.",
    "Where you gonna sit?",
    "Right here.\tRight here.",
    "Right there?",
    "Sure. These people didn't show up for\nthe first act,",
    "so evidently, they aren't coming.",
    "Honey, you can't sit there.",
    "We didn't pay for those seats.",
    "Oh, why not? They got all that extra\nmoney",
    "for the matinee tickets we didn't\nuse.",
    "She's got a point there, Rick.",
    "Now we'll fill you in on the first\nact.",
    "Yeah, see, this guy here, he isn't\nmarried.",
    "What'd I tell you?",
    "He wrote a letter and...",
    "Don't cry",
    "Don't cry",
    "Come on back in the house",
    "And don't cry",
    "Come on back in the house",
    "And get out from under that old, cold\nsky",
    "Don't weep",
    "Don't weep",
    "Come on back in the house, little\nsheep",
    "Come on back...",
    "Could've come by train,",
    "but oh, no, you had to drive.",
    "Okay, okay, I had to drive.",
    "65 miles an hour.",
    "I thought that judge would never let\nus go.",
    "Look, we've already missed the first\nact.",
    "You going to talk all the way through\nthe second?",
    "Oh, no.",
    "Shh, shh, shh!",
    "What are you doing?",
    "Shh, shh, shh!",
    "What are you doing?",
    "They took our seats.",
    "I know that, but you can't sit here.",
    "Why not?",
    "Shh!",
    "There's not enough room.",
    "They're sitting four people in two\nseats!",
    "Go down and tell the manager.",
    "You go. I'd like to see just two\nminutes of this show.",
    "I will not...",
    "Shh, shh, shh!",
    "I'm going to see the manager.",
    "Could you just move over a little?",
    "Just move over...",
    "I'm not pushing.",
    "Just move...",
    "Honey, I'd like some orangeade.",
    "Orangeade?",
    "Yes, I'm thirsty.",
    "Yeah, you're also crafty,",
    "but it won't work.",
    "You want an orangeade, go get it\nyourself.",
    "Oh...",
    "And when you're down in the lobby,\nstay there.",
    "Oh, shh!\nStop your grumbling.",
    "Shh!",
    "Wait a minute, wait a\nminute",
    "You're from big D",
    "I can guess",
    "By the way you drawl and the way you\ndress",
    "You're from big D",
    "My, oh, yes",
    "Big D, little A, double L, A-S...",
    "Where you going?",
    "I'm really thirsty.\nI'm going to get some orangeade.",
    "Well, listen, get me some, too, will\nyou?",
    "Yeah, all right.\nAnd...",
    "take your time.",
    "Oh, all right.",
    "Yes",
    "Big D, little A, double-L, A...",
    "Big D, little A, double-L, A...",
    "Big D, little A, double L, A-S...",
    "Move over, honey.",
    "I beg your pardon.",
    "Oh, sorry, wrong honey.",
    "Here you are, Ethel.",
    "What's this?",
    "Your bag. I knocked it off the\nbalcony,",
    "but thank goodness, I found it in the\naisle",
    "downstairs right next to a lady's\nseat.",
    "Oh.",
    "Lucy!\nWhat?",
    "This isn't my bag.",
    "Where are you going?",
    "Where you going?",
    "Downstairs.\nWe'll be right back.",
    "Well, don't hurry.",
    "This is most peculiar.",
    "Now, how could a thing like that\npossibly happen?",
    "Well, it's perfectly obvious.",
    "Somebody hit me on the head with this",
    "and then made off with my purse.",
    "There's a purse snatcher somewhere\nhere in this theater.",
    "You know, maybe I'd better call the\npolice.",
    "Well, I think you...",
    "Just let us go down the aisle.",
    "We won't make any noise.",
    "There was $500 in her purse.",
    "I'm sorry. You'll have to see the\nmanager.",
    "There she is! That's the purse\nsnatcher.",
    "What? What are you talking about?",
    "That's my purse!",
    "Oh, and that's my purse.",
    "What are you doing with my purse?",
    "Oh, what are you doing with her\npurse?",
    "Now, wait, wait.\njust a minute.",
    "Uh-uh, wait a minute.",
    "I'll take care of these, please,",
    "until we find out for sure just what\nhappened.",
    "I told you what happened.",
    "She hit me over the head with that",
    "and stole my purse.",
    "Now, not at all.\nIt was an accident.",
    "I knocked her purse out of the\nbalcony",
    "where we were sitting and I went\ndownstairs",
    "and I picked up that purse,",
    "thinking it was this purse because in\na dark theater,",
    "that purse looks a lot like this\npurse.",
    "In fact, right now",
    "you can't tell that purse from that\npurse.",
    "All right, now, let me get this\nstraight.",
    "Now, this is the purse",
    "you thought was that purse...",
    "I thought this purse was this purse.",
    "This is her purse.\nThis is mine.",
    "All right, ladies, ladies, now,",
    "wait just a minute.",
    "Now, please, look, hold everything.",
    "Look, why doesn't everybody just take\nher own purse?",
    "Yes.",
    "Now, is everybody happy?",
    "Well, I...I guess so.",
    "Nothing seems to be missing.",
    "Lucy...\nWhat?",
    "...the money's gone.",
    "Oh, no. Oh, no.",
    "She stole $500 out of my purse!",
    "Oh, don't be ridiculous!",
    "Well, if you didn't take it, where is\nit?",
    "I have no idea.",
    "Are you sure you had $500 in your\npurse?",
    "Oh, I'm positive.\nYes.",
    "Maybe she took it out",
    "before she threw it over the railing.",
    "Well, really!",
    "How dare you!",
    "She wouldn't do a thing like that!",
    "Would you, Lucy?",
    "Ethel!",
    "I'm sorry, honey, I'm so upset, I-I\ndon't know what I'm saying.",
    "You see, I have a penny-pinching\nhusband",
    "who's gonna kill me when he finds out\nthe money's gone.",
    "Well, lady, can you prove you had\n$500 in your purse?",
    "No. Her penny-pinching husband can.",
    "Yes, yes. He's sitting in box A with\nher husband.",
    "Now just go up Yes.\t   there and\nask him.",
    "Look, would you go up and bring them\ndown here, please?",
    "Mr. Ricardo and Mr. Mertz.",
    "Ask them to come down right away.",
    "Tell them to hurry.\nLucy?",
    "Yes?",
    "Will you tell Fred when he gets here?",
    "What about you?",
    "Oh, I'll be standing right behind\nyou,",
    "bobbing and weaving.",
    "All right, Ethel, I'll tell him.",
    "I'll just say, \"Fred, we lost your\n$500.",
    "But I'll say, \"Fred, it was your\nfault",
    "for putting the money in Ethel's\npurse.\"",
    "And then I'll say, \"Fred, take your\nhands",
    "from around Lucy's neck.\"",
    "That's right.",
    "What's the matter, what\nhappened?",
    "Is this a trick to get us out of the\nseats?",
    "No. Now, Fred,",
    "Fred, something awful has happened.",
    "Uh, I accidentally knocked Ethel's\npurse out of the box",
    "where we were sitting, and it hit\nthat woman on the head.",
    "Now, Fred, we got the purse back all\nright, but...",
    "your $500 is missing.",
    "How's that, Fred?",
    "Oh, dear me.",
    "Oh, he must be delirious.",
    "Fred...",
    "Fred, your rent money's gone. Fred,\nthey lost it.",
    "I just pretended to put the money in\nthe purse",
    "to throw the pickpockets off the\ntrack.",
    "You don't think I'd trust Ethel with\n500 bucks, do you?",
    "Oh, dear me!\t   Oh,\nFred...",
    "Oh...",
    "Oh, Fred, how could you do a thing\nlike that?",
    "Oh, I'm, I'm so sorry.",
    "Me, too, me, too, lady.",
    "Well, I guess we were all pretty\nexcited.",
    "Yes.",
    "Oh, dear.",
    "Oh!",
    "Well, I guess we can all go back to\nour seats",
    "and see the rest of the show.",
    "Why don't you go in?",
    "I'm tired of sitting four in two\nseats.",
    "Oh, come on, honey, it's not so bad.",
    "No, come on, Rick.",
    "Uh, uh, just a moment.",
    "Did you say four in two seats?",
    "Oh, yes, yes. There was a ticket\nmix-up, you see,",
    "so the four of us are sharing two\nseats.",
    "Oh, well, I'm sorry.",
    "Oh, that's all right.\nWe don't mind.",
    "Uh-uh-uh-uh. Now...",
    "...if four people have been watching\nthe show,",
    "then you've got to pay for four.",
    "Oh, well, yeah... no, no, that's not\nquite right.",
    "You don't understand.",
    "You see, the four of us didn't watch\nthe show.",
    "No.",
    "Actually, we didn't even see the\nfirst half at all.",

    "Did she?\nYes, she did.",
    "I told her the secret were your fresh\neggs.",

    "Why, Lucy, I think you're jealous.",
    "Jealous?",
    "Ha!",
    "You're acting jealous.",

    "like we have in our den.",
    "I could bring it over tonight and see\nwhat it looks like.",
    "And the next time we go into New\nYork,",
    "I could get you one just like it.",

    "Would you tell me if you think",
    "I should wallpaper the halls?",
    "Sure. Let's go look at it.",
    "That isn't the moon That's my mommy.",

    "No, she's with your Aunt Ethel.",
    "Got some cookies I'm hungry?",
    "Yeah. Come on!",

    "After all, she owns this house.",
    "By the way, Ethel,",
    "Lucy's been acting so strange lately.",
    "If I didn't know better,",
    "I'd think she was jealous of our\nfriendship.",
    "Oh, why should she be jealous?",

    "Well, I just can't figure her out.",
    "When you've known Lucy as long as I\nhave,",

    "for you here.",
    "A housewarming gift!\nWhy, thanks.",

    "I don't think you ought to tell her I\nbought it for you.",
    "Okay.",
    "Go, ahead, open it.",
    "What's that, Ethel?",
    "It's a housewarming gift.",
    "But whatever you do, don't tell Lucy.",
    "Oh, all right.",
    "Well, I've got to run now.",
    "Don't forget tonight, Ethel.",
    "Don't worry, Betty, I won't.",
    "Honey, I have been such a fool.",
    "What do you mean, dear?",
    "Oh, you know, I was kind of upset\nabout Betty and Ethel",
    "seeing so much of each other, but...",
    "Do you know what those two little\ndears been up to?",
    "What?\nThey're giving us",
    "a surprise housewarming party\ntonight.",

    "You see, honey, and you were jealous.",
    "Jealous?",
    "Oh, What in the world are you talking\nabout?",
    "How could I possibly be jealous of my\ntwo very best friends?",
    "Oh, honey.",
    "Oh, jealous, never, never.",

    "when we spend an evening alone.",
    "Well, there you got me.",
    "Well, I don't know.",
    "It's after 9:00.",
    "Are you sure the party's tonight?",
    "Of course, dear.",
    "Well, where are they?",
    "Well, they're probably gathering",
    "over at the Mertzes, you know,",
    "and they all want to come over\ntogether.",
    "Oh.",
    "What are you doing?",
    "Oh.",
    "I was practicing looking surprised.",
    "Oh.",
    "I don't want to spoil their fun.",
    "You ought to do it, too.",
    "You ought to try it.\nGo ahead.",
    "Try it.\nTry what?",
    "Try looking surprised.",
    "Oh, honey, it's a surprise party, not\na holdup.",
    "Don't pop your eyes out like that.",
    "I can't help it.",
    "When I'm surprised, my eyes pop out.",
    "Well, not so far, then.\nYou looked like",

    "that people slammed on their brakes",
    "and pulled over to the side.",
    "when they saw me coming.",
    "Then what happened?",

    "except for an occasional detour into\nsomeone's yard, you know--",

    "How did you finally get it stopped?",
    "Well, I-I cleverly ran it into that\nhedge",
    "I wanted to get rid of.",

    "Oh, Betty, I'm sorry.",
    "I can explain everything.",
    "Then you did do it.",
    "Oh, Lucy, I knew you wanted to win,",
