    "Excuse me?",
    "I know you didn't think anyone would catch you,\nbut you just slammed your door into my car.",
    "The least you could do is say you're sorry, lady.",
    "You don't have to take that tone.",
    "It's not like I'm hurting your resale value.",
    "I'm sorry.",
    "See? Like that.",
    "I don't know what happened.",
    "I just lost control of myself.",
    "It was like an out-of-body experience, and I was there\nwatching this woman go insane. And the woman was me.",
    "But you know what, Hal?",
    "I'd do it all over again.",
    "It felt great.",
    "It was almost worth destroying my car.",
    "Well, honey, the important thing is no cops were there to see it.",
    "No one says a word.",
    "This is my one. My one to your 11,000.",
    "So,",
    "due to unforeseen circumstances, we are now completely broke.",
    "Therefore, I am making a proclamation.",
    "This will be a handmade Christmas.",
    "We're not spending any money on gifts.",
    "They will be homemade,",
    "and therefore, more personal",
    "and more thoughtful.",
    "- But you can't do this!\n- Well, I think it's high time we had a handmade Christmas.",
    "You boys just don't appreciate the holidays.\nTo you it's nothing but a disgusting orgy of materialism.",
    "- But...\n- No buts!",
    "You're the ones who turned your mother\ninto a ticking time bomb!",
    "Oh, you just thank your lucky stars\nthat she went off on an innocent bystander!",
    "So we had our Christmas feast of oatmeal and hot dog buns.\nSince then, we've been waiting three hours for Dad to come out of the garage.",
    "What is taking him so long?",
    "What are you talking about?",
    "Nothing you'd be interested in.",
    "You don't know that.",
    "If it's interesting to you guys,\nit's gonna be interesting to me.",
    "We were wondering what nose hairs smell like.",
    "Well, that's very interesting!",
    "Hal, hurry up already!",
    "In a minute.",
    "Hal!",
    "All right, everyone over by the tree.",
    "- Open mine first!\n- Okay, okay. Let's see what little Dewey made for his dad.",
    "Where did you find that?",
    "I never take a good picture.",
    "I went through every box in the attic and found that one.",
    "I made the frame with mementos of your hobbies.",
    "Wait. You made this frame?",
    "Yeah.",
    "See it has a little golf club, a fishing pole, a poker hand.\nI even pasted on the Jumble you finished.",
    "Dewey, this is really nice.",
    "- Here, Mom, this is from me.\n- Oh, it's so heavy.",
    "Wow! Reese, are these jams?",
    "And candies. I had some sugar left over, so I figured, why not, it's Christmas.",
    "- You made this?!\n- Here, Mom. Here, Dad.",
    "Oh, my God, it's a clock.",
    "You made this?!",
    "I read up on all-wood clocks and then borrowed the tools from wood shop.\nSee the gears? They make different patterns as they turn.",
    "Oh, I'm very impressed, boys.\nYou all worked so hard on these gifts.",
    "- Open mine next. It's a sonata I composed for you.\n- Oh, I'll get to it.",
    "It's your father's turn to give something.",
    "My gift...",
    "isn't here.",
    "- Not here? What do you mean?\nWell, we-we knew the boys would really come through with great gifts,",
    "and any present that top what they did can't be here...",
    "can it?",
    "Merry Chris...\nYou started without us?",
    "Dad's about to give us a really cool present!",
    "Is it outside?",
    "Let's find out.",
    "Like a treasure hunt?",
    "Wow, Mom, this is fantastic.\nI am so happy to be home for Christmas.",
    "You said this house was Satan's trash can.",
    "You're quoting me out of context.",
    "So, Dad, where is it?",
    "Are we supposed to drive to it?",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes!",
    "You guessed the first clue.\nEverybody into the van. Let's go!",
    "- Hal...\n- Merry Christmas, honey!",
    "Are we there yet?",
    "Yeah, where are we going?",
    "I know. We're going to Disneyland.",
    "It's a thousand times better than Disneyland.",
    "Cool!",
    "What was that?",
    "A handshake.",
    "Now they've got some lame, third-grade secret handshake.",
    "I think I got half of it.",
    "We love Dad!",
    "We love Dad!",
    "We love Dad!",
    "We love Dad!",
    "We love Dad!",
    "Rest stop. Everybody out. No eye contact with strangers.",
    "Look at 'em scamper.",
    "- You don't need to...?\n- No.",
    "- You couldn't have said twice as good as Disneyland?\n- You saw those presents, Lois!\nWhat was I supposed to do? My presents were crap!",
    "- What did you make them?\n- Lanyards.",
    "Still better than what I had.",
    "Look, I underestimated these boys, Lois, \nand they deserve to have a really great Christmas.",
    "How much money do we have?",
    "- Zero.\n- No, I mean everything: credit cards, loose change, everything?",
    "- Oh. Minus $512.\n- What?!",
    "Oh, for God's sakes!",
    "Can you think of a Christmas reason for stopping somewhere I can sell blood?",
    "Oh, Hal, don't worry about it. It'll be okay.",
    "You just need to find something that's a thousand times better than Disneyland,",
    "open on Christmas day and free.",
    "Just because it's hard, Lois, doesn't mean it's impossible.\nI am going to make this happen.",
    "Hal, we don't even have enough gas to get home.",
    "Yes, we do. I did all the calculations, Lois.\nWe're exactly 40 miles from the point of no return. And I promise you,",
    "I will figure out a plan by then.",
    "If not, I will turn the van around.\nJust don't rat me out.",
    "Please, honey.",
    "It's Christmas.",
    "I can't wait much longer.",
    "Mom, is it really going to be as good as Dad says?",
    "Dewey, I think you'll remember this day for a long time.",
    "I think we'll all remember this day for a very long time.",
    "All right, since no one wants to race cigarette butts, I'm outta here.",
    "Francis, I need to talk to you about something.",
    "It's weird,",
    "- but lately I kind of feel like I'm being left out by Reese and Dewey.\n- Aw, geez. Look, I'm sorry. You weren't supposed to know about the beach trip.",
    "- What?!\n- Hey, geez, watch it!",
    "What beach trip?!",
    "I took Reese and Dewey to the beach last summer.\nI would've invited you, but you were over at Stevie's.",
    "He lives two blocks away!",
    "You have to go by his house to get to the beach!",
    "Why is this happening?",
    "I'm the brother everybody likes the best.",
    "What are you talking about?\nI'm the brother everybody likes best.",
    "I meant of the brothers who are still at home.",
    "That's Dewey.",
    "- What? Where am I in the pecking order?\n- Malcolm, I am not gonna stand here in a public toilet and rank me,\nDewey, Reese, Jamie and you in order of popularity.",
    "So are we getting close?",
    "Now, now.",
    "You're not going to trick me into giving it away.",
    "It's a surprise.",
    "Hal, you are five miles from your point of no return.",
    "Look, I know we don't talk about our emotions, but I don't care anymore.",
    "I'm just going to lay it out there.",
    "My feelings are hurt.",
    "There, I said it.",
    "They're hurt because you guys are systematically excluding me.",
    "Being excluded is extra hard for me because I see all the other places\nI don't fit in, and we're brothers.",
    "I really want us to be in this together.",
    "What a gasbag.",
    "Your feelings aren't hurt. Your ego is bruised.",
    "The reason we exclude you sometimes  is because you're a drag.",
    "You always have to be the special one.",
    "Even now, this is all about how you feel things more deeply than everyone else.",
    "Look, we love you. We just need a break from you once in a while.",
    "- Okay, Hal...\n- Francis, can I see you up here for a second, please?\nI need your help with the radio.",
    "- What are you...?\n- I need to borrow $1,800. I'll pay you back over the next six years in monthly payments of $39.50.\nI have no money to give these boys a Christmas gift and I'm not even sure where I'm driving.",
    "I hate to ask you, but I don't know what else to do.",
    "I love you.",
    "Well I guess this is as good a time as any to tell you.",
    "- I got fired from my job. I'm totally broke.\n- What?",
    "- You got fired from the ranch?\n- It turns out the ATM I was making all of Otto's deposits into wasn't an ATM.",
    "So sue me, right?",
    "Anyway, he's suing me.",
    "- I don't know what we're going to do.\n- You're not moving back in!",
    "- There isn't room enough in the house!\n- Besides, Piama doesn't want to live with us.",
    "Piama doesn't even know about it.\nShe thinks I'm on vacation.",
    "- I've been acting like the happiest man in the world\nthe last few weeks just to hide it from her.\n- I have to say, I am a little disappointed in you, Francis.",
    "You can't hide something like this from the ones you love.",
    "Honesty: it's the cornerstone of any healthy relationship.",
    "Well, I'm sorry I can't help you.",
    "Okay, Hal, it's been 40 miles. We are at the point of no return.",
    "Hal, turn around.",
    "Let's get out and stretch your legs!",
    "You're coming Malcom?",
    "You're sure? I might accidently talk about myself.",
    "You mean like just now?",
    "- Hal what are you doing,\n- I'm buying time.",
    "I don't know how you gotta be along with this but that's it!",
    "The Christmas lie is over.",
    "- 60 more seconds, Lois. You can time me.\n- I'm not...!",
    "Fine.",
    "Whoa, nice rides.",
    "Yeah. The fat lady at the car wash rides one of these.",
    "- Nice going, Dewey!\n- I wasn't even touching it. It was you!",
    "What'd you do, man?!",
    "Wait, wait!\nThose guys didn't do it.",
    "What are you talking about?",
    "I'm not going to let these people take the blame when they didn't do it.",
    "It was my dad.",
    "He was trying to teach me a lesson so I wouldn't grow up and be like you.",
    "Malcolm, oh, my God, that was awesome!",
    "- That was so cool!\n- Thanks!",
    "Okay, honey, you've got 20 seconds.",
    "Lois, there is going to be a Christmas!",
    "Hal, no!",
    "Oh, no! I seem to have slipped in an oil stain left here\nby a negligent owner or employee.",
    "Hal!",
    "Oh, my God!",
    "Are you okay?",
    "Yes, damn it!",
    "Oh, thank goodness.",
    "I don't have any insurance.",
    "We both dodged a bullet.",
    "After I sweep this up, you're getting wiper  blades on the house.",
    "Hal...",
    "You know what?",
    "- I saw a trail behind here that leads up into the hills. There's probably \nsomething really great up there. All we need is a few flashlights to get started.\n- Hal,",
    "it's time for you to face the boys and tell them what's going on.\nHal, they're good boys.",
    "They forgave you for banjo camp; they'll forgive you for this.",
    "And I will try sharing the blame with you, but honey,",
    "this has got your fingerprints all over it.",
    "- You know, you're a pretty good brother after all.\n- Thanks. You look cold. Take my jacket.",
    "I think I could've handled those bikers,",
    "but with a baby and a chick around, you probably did the  right thing, Malcolm.",
    "Thanks for thinking of us, Reese.",
    "What's this?",
    "Nothing. Give me that.",
    "It's a credit card receipt from The Clockworks.",
    "You bought those clocks?",
    "You have a credit card? Since when?",
    "They sent it to me in the mail a couple months ago.",
    "They must've thought I was old enough after I won that physics award.",
    "So when I superglued my eyelids shut, and I was in the emergency room,\nwe could've used your credit card instead of having to call Mom?!",
    "I'm not going to let you jeopardize my credit rating.\nI want to buy a house someday.",
    "Malcolm, you're a jerk.",
    "Mom, Malcolm has a credit card, and he bought you Christmas presents with it.",
    "What?",
    "Malcolm, you bought those presents,",
    "after everything I've been through?",
    "We all worked so hard to make this a special Christmas, \nand you just took a cheap shortcut!",
    "- Those clocks cost 50 bucks each!\n- I don't care what they cost!",
    "This isn't a competition, Malcolm.",
    "You know, all I really want from you on Christmas is this!",
    "I forgive you, son.",
    "Okay, everybody, listen up. \nI don't want this to ruin our trip.",
    "- You wanna know where we're going?\n- Yeah!",
    "Snow skiing on Mount Bundy!",
    "That's a room for the night, ski passes and equipment rentals.\nWill you be putting that on your credit card?",
    "Let's give it a shot.",
    "Oh, yes!",
    "In your face!",
    "Hal, this is the low point, isn't it?",
    "We're not going to sink any further, are we?",
    "- What are you talking about?\n- You've stolen our son's credit card.",
    "If it weren't for my rage and your recklessness,\nour kids might have a fighting chance.",
    "Lois, those are the exact things that make us great parents.\nIf it wasn't for your anger and my recklessness,\nwe wouldn't be on this amazing ski vacation, would we?",
    "You know, this just might be our best Christmas ever.",
    "Francis, I want you to quit your job.",
    "- What?\n- Ever since we left on this trip, you've just seemed so insanely happy.",
    "I can't let you go back to that job.\nYou've got to find something else to do.",
    "You're right.",
    "You know, in fact, let's not even go back to that ranch.\nI'll call Otto in the morning, and if he doesn't understand,",
    "tough.",
    "Okay, so who wants some hot chocolate by the fire, huh?",
    "- Enjoy your stay, Malcolm.\n- Thanks."

    "What is so special about this board?",
    "I think it's my last time.",
    "Last time for what?",
    "For anything stupid and reckless and fun.",
    "Maybe it's because I'm almost 18 now,",
    "but lately I've been hearing this voice in my head that says,",
    "\"That's dangerous, that's stupid.\nYou're gonna hurt yourself.\"",

    "Lois, did you see what he did in there?",
    "He used my tennis racket to smash \nmy camera and all my lenses to bits!",
    "I still had film in it from the Us Festival!",
    "Where is he?",
    "Hal, it's not his fault! I'm pretty sure \nhe's working through a limitation-anxiety phase.",
    "All the literature says this is the age where he's trying...",
    "You cannot undermine me every time I try to discipline him!",
    "I can't help it. He's so small, and helpless...",
    "I can't take any more of this! \nIt is tearing our marriage apart!",
    "For his own good, you have got to buckle down!",
    "Do you understand me, Lois? \nYou have to find some way to be this boy's mother!",
    "Hello, Dr. Sachs? It's Lois again.",
    "I know I just called, but... my husband yelled \nat me again about being stricter with Francis,",
    "and I wanted to know if you could write me a note",
    "that says yelling at him could damage his psyche?",

    "and not give him what he wants. \nHe has such a sweet little face and he's so innocent.",
    "I'm going to have to call you back.",
    "Fire... is... dangerous.",

    "I don't care if you grow up to hate me, \nbut you will understand this:",
    "I will... do... anything.",
    "That is how much I love you.",
    "Yes. That's right. It's coming back to me; \nthat sense of strength and power, and purpose...",
    "I finally knew who I was, and what I was born to be.",
    "Honey, you're back!",

    "What?!",
    "I am completely unprepared for this. I've had no practice.\nI haven't made a decision around here in years.",
    "When exactly did it get to the point where\nyou make all the decisions in our marriage?",
    "When you said, \"Lois, I want you to\nmake all the decisions in our marriage.\"",
    "Well, you didn't have to listen to me.",
    "Oh, I got all this stuff racing through my mind.\nI, I can't eat, I can't sleep...",
    "Oh, Hal, if you want, I'll make the decision for you.",
    "No.",
    "I was given this responsibility.",
    "A man entrusted his fate in my hands.\nI can't just shrug that off.",
    "I can do this.",

    "Yes.",

    "Lois, I have made the decision.",

    "Hal.",
    "Oh, all right.",
    "I'll keep trying.",
    "Craig, I'd like to welcome you to the\nfirst day of your new, more vicious life.",
    "I give you... the human body.",
    "For clarity, we've divided it into the\nthree major theaters of operation.",
    "The head.",
    "The torso.",
    "And what are those?",
    "You know what those are.",
    "Now the first thing you need to\nknow is that this is all about pride.",
    "Do you have pride, Craig?",
    "Yes.",
    "Okay, that is not the answer I was looking for.",
    "You show me a man with pride, and I'll\nshow you a man with limited options.",
    "Let's say that this is your opponent,\nand he's coming after you.",
    "Hey, man, we can work this out.\nI didn't know she was your girl.",
    "See? Now he's blind, and you have\nthe time to really get creative.",
    "Personally, I like to leave at least one sense\nintact so he knows what's happening to him.",
    "I knew I came to the right place.",
    "Okay, Dewey, you're up.",
    "Okay, first, I'm going to need\nyou to take off your glasses.",
    "Ow! My eyes!",
    "I didn't know we were starting!",

    "All right, Craig, listen.",
    "I want you to think.",
    "I want you to visualize every bully\nthat ever picked on you or beat you up.",
    "Really see the look of contempt on\ntheir faces as they pounded on you.",
    "- You got it?\n- Mm-hmm.",
    "Now, picture what they were looking at.",
    "Oh. It's disgusting!",
    "Is he going for the plums?",
    "It appears so.",
    "Well, he sure won't have to worry\nabout the guy's children coming after him.",
    "Look at him.",
    "He can't even move, and still you\ncan see how much he's suffering.",
    "Lying there, enduring the pain, hour after endless hour.",
    "You can see in his face he's just\nbegging to be put out of his misery.",
    "- It's awful.\n- Oh God, yes.",
    "Look at him. Look how hard he's fighting.",
    "Those clenched hands, the set of his jaw.\nIt's inspiring to see such a fierce will to live.",
    "He really wants to make it.",
    "It's beautiful. He's really gonna...",
    "Here's extra pudding if...",
    "Okay, it was a good plan having the guy meet you here.",
    "We've set up a few things to give\nyou a little edge if you get in trouble.",
    "There's a broken bottle in that pile of leaves,\nand a can of bug spray under the Big Wheel.",
    "- If it runs out, it still makesa great blunt object.\n- Remember, we're here for you.",
    "Unless it looks like you're getting a total beating.\nThen I may have to take his side.",

    "Craigy?",
    "Is that you back there?",
    "Hello, Dad.",
    "For God's sake, son, you have no upper body strength at all.\nI know girls that could get out of this hold.",
    "Get your foot off my neck so I can kill you.",
    "Craigy, do you have any idea how\npathetic you look right now?",
    "Do you even care?",
    "Are you so wrapped up with being a useless piece of pudgethat\nyou can't even see how embarrassed you're making me?",
    "Um, I think he needs to breathe.",
    "I'm going to let you up now. I want you to dust yourself off,\nsuck in your gut, and introduce me to your friends.",
    "I'm not doing anything you tell me. I hate you.",
    "And I wasn't even choking. I was faking it.",
    "Vic Feldspar. Nice to meet you, boys.",
    "- I'm this one's father, I guess.\n- Father? Ha!",
    "You pretended not to know me at the father-son picnic.",
    "Sorry I wasn't swelling with pride while I watched\nyou suck the butter off other people's corncobs.",
    "You wonder why I'm so messed up?",
    "It's because from the day I was born, I've heard nothing\nbut four-count Burpees and constant, lisping criticism.",
    "Why don't you go back to San Diego and all your macho friends?",
    "- I'm not leaving until you seriously think about my offer.\n- I don't want your stupid gymnasiums.",
    "I told you.",
    "Craigy, the people in Chicago put in a very nice bid.",
    "I can't put them off anymore. This is your last chance.",
    "He wants to give you\na string of gymnasiums?",
    "As long as he can get me back under his thumb.",
    "Actually, I'm giving them up either way. It's time for me to retire.",
    "I got a top of the line Fleetwood RV.",
    "I'm going to drag it across America with my teeth.",
    "Son, don't be an idiot. There is still a chance I can fix you.",
    "I don't care. I'm not going back with you.",
    "- I escaped, and I'm staying escaped.\n- Okay, you're obviously hysterical.",
    "I've got to start my 30-mile run.\nThat gives you two hours and 16 minutes to calm down.",
    "Meet me at Applebee's, and we'll try to discuss this like grown-ups.",
    "I'll come, but it'll be for the great\nservice and atmosphere, not for you!",
    "- Dad, what are you doing?\n- I am making a decision tree.",
    "It is a tool to help you make difficult decisions. First, I started out with\ntwo branches, one for pulling the plug, the other one for keeping him alive.",
    "Then I made branches from those\nbranches for all the possible outcomes.",
    "I'm getting it all out of my head so\nI can see what I'm dealing with logically.",
    "\"Pulling plug causes feeling of\nGodlike power. Forced to kill again\"?",
    "Well, I'm trying to cover everything. But now I have gone through\nall the possibilities, and I really think I am zeroing in on a decision.",
    "All your outcomes on \"pull the plug\"\nassume that he dies right away.",
    "Yes, Dewey, that's what pulling the plug means.",
    "Not necessarily.",
    "He could continue\nto live without his respirator,",
    "his body wasting away while he struggles for\nbreath like a fish on a dock gasping for air,",
    "slowly suffocating over the course of weeks or even months.",
    "- I read about this one...\n- Thank you, Dewey.",
    "Like I don't get enough of the\nknow-it-all stuff from Malcolm.",

    "I want to thank you people for your hospitality.",
    "Opening your house up to me and\nthe living garbage disposal over here.",
    "It's our pleasure.",
    "I hope you like dinner. I wasn't sure\nwhether to make a chicken or a ham.",
    "Chicken or ham, boy, that's a tough one. Chicken or ham.",
    "You're life must be a living hell.",
    "So, did Craig tell you how he got honorable\nmention for his community gardens?",
    "Sitting on his ass making food? Sounds about right.",
    "Hello.",
    "Oh, yes, Dr. Samson.",
    "Hal, you promised us a decision a week ago.\nThe hospital needs this room for urgent care patients.",
    "Now, we have to either pull the plug on Mr. Edelman\nor move him to a private intensive care facility.",
    "- We have to have your decision now, right now.\n- Okay, listen, I'm going to need your help here.",
    "Just strictly from an emotionless, purely\nmedical standpoint, what should I do?",
    "- Pull the plug.\n- Let him live.",
    "Damn it, Georgie, you know the chances for a\ncoma patient waking up are practically zero.",
    "Practically zero does not mean zero.\nWhy the hell do you give up so easily?",
    "He's shown no activity, no responsiveness,\nno eye movement for a month. It's over.",
    "You know as well as I that patients can be in a\npersistent vegetative state for years and still recover.",
    "We can argue about this all day.\nWe're not going to get anywhere. It's up to you.",
    "Just put an \"X\" somewhere.",
    "What's wrong with him?",
    "The doctors called it \"hysterical conversion disorder.\"\nIt's psychosomatic. Apparently, he's paralyzed from the waist up.",
    "Waist up?",
    "Dad, what is it?",
    "I think he's thanking you.",
    "Dad, what are you doing here?",
    "I told you no at Applebee's, no at Malcolm's house,",
    "and no all the way home as\nyou jogged alongside my car.",
    "I wanted to give you something.",
    "What is it?",
    "Used to call that your unk-unk.",
    "Your mother bought that for you the\nday she found out she was pregnant.",
    "The only day I saw her happier\nwas the day you were born.",
    "Wow.",
    "I haven't been totally honest with you, son,\nbut before I go, I owe you the truth.",
    "I never made it a secret\nhow disappointed I am with the way you turned out.",
    "But what you don't know is if your mother\nwas alive today, she's be just as disappointed.",
    "What?",
    "Opening those gyms wasn't just my dream,\nit was your mother's dream, too.",
    "Fitness was her life, and it was her dying wish\nfor you to embrace a life of health and vitality.",
    "- Why didn't you ever tell me that?\n- Because I kept thinking if I pushed you enough,",
    "eventually you'd turn yourself around.",
    "But, apparently to you, I'm an annoyance, not an inspiration.",
    "- No, you're...\n- It doesn't really matter.",
    "Your mom's in heaven now,\ncrying at the waste you made of your life.",
    "I know you don't want to run those gyms to please me,",
    "but you might want to consider doing it for your mother.",
    "Do those jumpsuits come in extra large?",
    "I waited all my life to hear those words.",
    "It's been four days, Hal. I've tried to be patient,\nbut this has gone on long enough.",
    "You've got to snap out of it.",
    "Look, I'll admit you've been resourceful.\nYou've learned to do so many things,",
    "and the sex has been interesting,\nbut you can't go on living like this.",
    "Don't think I don't know what this is all about, Hal.\nYou're trying to avoid making this decision.",
    "This is not going to work. And frankly,\nthis whole thing is beneath you.",
    "It's a cowards way out, Hal.",
    "You think I wouldn't like a paralyzed vacation,\neveryone waiting on me hand and foot?",
    "But you know what? It doesn't work that way.",
    "You can't make up ridiculous illnesses just\nto get out of doing what you don't want to do.",
    "Oh, for God's sake, do you have\nany idea how insane you're acting?",
    "I'm just glad that your boys aren't here to see this.",
    "Oh, Hal, you changed Jamie's diapers with those feet.",
    "- Reese, how could you just leave him in there?\n- Every time I pulled him out, Jamie started crying.",
    "Okay, this is ending right now.",
    "You are going to stop being paralyzed\nand you are going to make this decision.",
    "I know you think you can't do this.\nI know you're worried you'll choose wrong, but Hal,",
    "you had a very hard choice to make in your life\nbefore and you made not only a good decision.",
    "You made a brilliant one...",
    "you decided to marry me.",
    "No one thought it was a good idea.\nAll your friends thought you were making a horrible mistake.",
    "Your parents, my parents. They all said I was a pushy, opinionated\nloudmouth, but you knew I was perfect for you. And I am.",
    "It's the best decision anyone's ever made.",
    "Every day I wake up grateful or that brilliant, brilliant decision.",
    "And you can do it again, Hal. I know you can.",
    "But with you it was obvious.",
    "Even so, honey.",
    "You better say your good-byes quickly. We need to\nsqueeze in a lake swim before we head to the airport.",
    "- But...\n- Ready? Begin.",
    "I'll miss you guys.",

    "Let's face it. I don't have any better options.",
    "It's your lunchtime.",
    "That's his lunch?",
    "Every day until he drops 90 pounds.\nThese pills here are my own formula.",
    "It's got three times the RDA of the\nall you basic vitamins and nutrients.",
    "Sadly, it doesn't contain any character.",
    "See ya, Craig.",
    "I guess this means I don't owe\nyou that 50 bucks anymore.",
    "I'll think of you every time\nI open a jar of mayonnaise.",
    "So, um, Vic, Craig's mom was a real fitness buff, huh?",
    "Absolutely. She did a triathlon\nthe day after giving birth to Craig.",
    "There was no stopping that woman.",
    "Really? No stopping this woman?!",
    "Give that back!",
    "Mama?",
    "Oh, my God, she's beautiful. I thought you said all the\nphotos of her were destroyed in the twister that killed her.",
    "What did you want me to say? That your mother\nran out on me with a guy who owned a pie shop?",
    "That after years of slaving away to give that woman everything, she decided\nshe wasn't attracted to me anymore? That I wasn't man enough for her?",
    "Come on, Craig. What would that\nhave done to your self-esteem?",
    "- So, my mom is alive?\n- Oh, great. So, now this all going to be about her.",
    "How could you do this to me?\nHow could you lie to me all these years?",
    "I did what I thought was best for you.",
    "No, you didn't. You did what you thought would punish her. All this time,\nyou weren't yelling at me, but at this beautiful, beautiful woman.",
    "Dad, I'm not going with you.",
    "My life isn't a mess. I love my life.\nI love my job, I love my cat, I love my friends.",
    "I've made something of myself.\nI'm Desk Sergeant at my Neighborhood Watch.",
    "And a 14th-level elf cleric.\nI am not going to throw that away.",
    "You almost sounded like a man for a second.",
    "Good-bye, Dad.",
    "You actually have a pretty good grip there, son.",
    "It's my joystick hand.",
    "Hal, I am so proud of you for making such\na great decision. And such a surprising one.",
    "I thought your only choices were life or death.\nWho would have thought there was a third option?",
    "People aren't willing to think outside the box.\nSee, the answer was there all the time.",
    "Someone just had to see it. Once I found out\nhe was a bird lover, well, it all made sense.",
    "- And everything was at Radio Shack?\n- Everything but the hat.",
    "You know what, Hal? Your solution was so brilliant, would you mind walking me\nthrough it one more time, step-by-step, just so I understand it completely?",
    "Honey, no, it was so exhausting.\nI don't think I'll talk about it ever again.",
    "Well, I suppose it's for the best."

    "Since we're stuck watching him, I figured\nwe might as well do something cool with him.",
    "What's cooler than a smoking baby?",
    "Why don't you just shoot him out of a cannon?",
    "Come on, he could be famous.",
    "You know, \"Jamie, that smokin' baby.\"\nHe could do talk shows or tour with rock bands.",
    "But he doesn't even care.",
    "Give him a break. He's not even two.",
    "I'm not mad that he won't light the cigarette.\nI'm mad that he won't try.",
    "I think he's stupid.",
    "Look, pal, we missed the chance\nto raise you inside a Sparklet's bottle.",
    "This is our last shot.",
    "We're not going to move.\nWe're going to sit here for as long as it takes.",
    "Aw, man!",
    "You did that on purpose.",
    "You going to play it that way, fine. Now it's war.",
    "I miss the rotary phone, too.",
    "It made you slow down.\nThink about what you're gonna say.",
    "Yeah, exactly. Now it's bup-bup-bup and\nthere they are whether you're ready or not.",
    "This is wonderful.",
    "Just think, when we get to heaven\nwe'll feel like this all the time.",
    "Wouldn't that be nice?",
    "What do you mean?",
    "I mean, it would be nice, heaven.",
    "You mean it will be nice.",
    "I just don't personally... believe in that.",
    "Well, okay, maybe not the clouds and the harps and angels,\nbut you do believe in some kind of heaven, right?",
    "Okay, so you don't believe in heaven, but you do believe in\nsome kind of paradise where our two souls will go spend eternity.",
    "I'm just not much of an afterlife person.",
    "Wait a minute, Lois. Where are good\npeople rewarded and bad people punished?",
    "Right here on Earth, if I have anything to say about it.",
    "How is it I didn't know about this until now?",
    "Well, I guess we just never had time to talk about it.",
    "- Are you okay?\n- Yeah, yeah.",
    "It's silly to ruin tiki time over this.",
    "I will refresh our drinks.",
    "Oh, I can't do this! You've ruined it.",
    "Why?",
    "Because for the last 20 years I've assumed we'd be spending eternity together.\nAnd if you don't believe that, then you won't be there.",
    "Is that the rule?",
    "Nothing about this place is right anymore.",
    "It feels like that New Zealand\nMocking Mask is... mocking me.",
    "Hal, I didn't say this to upset you.",
    "I know...",
    "Can we talk about it?",
    "I think we've talked enough.",
    "I'm going to go take kind of a long walk now.",
    "But you stay. Enjoy your rum-tumbler.",
    "Look at me play with this great toy,\nand I'm not gonna share it!",
    "Whee! This is fun!",
    "I'm not gonna turn around. Is he getting pissed?",
    "He's eating his foot.",
    "Nice cover.",
    "I'm getting to him.",
    "You're having a feud with a toddler.",
    "And you don't think he's playing that for all it's worth?",
    "Well, tiki time is over.",
    "You boys don't have to baby-sit anymore.",
    "And Monte Carlo Night is starting to shape up really nicely.",
    "We've got really cool-looking plastic champagne glasses, and we've also got six-channel\nwalkie-talkies so we can be in constant audio contact in all sectors of the gymnasium.",
    "I also took it upon myself to raise the balloon budget.",
    "I figure if we're not going mylar, then why even bother?",
    "Okay, great, Victor.",
    "All right, and that brings us to the auction.",
    "It's gonna be horrible, but not because I'm not busting my butt.",
    "I've been hitting up people all around town, trying to get decent\nstuff that people will actually bid on, but no one's interested!",
    "Well, I'm sure you're doing the best that you can.",
    "Meeting adjourned.",
    "I can't believe that this is what\nhappens when you actually try.",
    "Um, Good Night.",
    "- Why can't we just get past this?\n- I don't know.",
    "Why the hell did we think that talking\nto each other was a good idea?",
    "We were having fun and we got greedy. Now look at us.",
    "We used to have no time at all\nfor each other, and it worked great.",
    "We should warn people. Write a book. Go on Oprah.",
    "- You know what would help?\n- What?",
    "If you changed your mind and told\nme that you believed in heaven.",
    "You want me to lie to you?",
    "It's not lying if what you say would\nbe true if the facts were different.",
    "I'll work with whatever you give me. If you just say the words, you'll be\ngiving me a tiny little gray area where I can live in peace for the rest of my life.",
    "I can live in gray, Lois.\nLet me live in gray!",
    "Hal, I'm sorry, I have to tell you the truth.",
    "Why?",
    "Because it's what I believe in.",
    "It's what I hang onto. The truth is all that I have.",
    "If I could give it up for anybody,\nI would give it up for you, but I just can't.",
    "Heaven's going to suck!",
    "We have to be home by 9:30. The baby-sitter\nsaid her halfway house goes into lockdown at 10:00.",
    "Did she tell you about the mobile over Jamie's crib?",
    "She said it looked like somebody took a saw and cut almost all tugh it.",
    "That's weird.",
    "It's not like he has any enemies or anything.",
    "Hey, Malcolm, the place looks great.\nLook at all these balloons.",
    "This is going to be a fun night.",
    "If watching your son be humiliated in front\nof the whole school is your idea of fun.",
    "What are you talking about?",
    "You're finally getting the attention you always wanted.",
    "Oh, come on, honey. I know you're upset.\nLet's try to have some fun tonight.",
    "Sure.",
    "If the here and now is all we've got, then\nlet's enjoy it in all its beauty and wonder.",
    "I'll get us some churros.",
    "Hello, Malc.",
    "- Malc?\n- Forgive me, I'm feeling very odd tonight.",
    "What is it called when you look around\nand you are not filled with festering rage?",
    "- Being moderately happy?\n- That is it!",
    "I am moderately happy. I have brake pads,\nand enough left overfor a side mirror.",
    "And now I find that there's a wine tasting booth with\nan incredibly underpriced Riesling, just 25 cents a glass.",
    "So, if you'll excuse me, I think I saw a slightly\ndrunk Ms. Bartlett headed for the ladies' room.",
    "I can't wait to see the look on Jamie's face tomorrow\nwhen he tries to tickle what's left of Elmo.",
    "Then he'll be sorry he started this.",
    "Stupid baby.",
    "Reese, let me ask you. When you end up in a situation like this,\ndoes it ever even occur to you to stop and figure out how you got there?",
    "And let him win?",
    "I mean, what do you do when your concept of eternity\nis wrapped up in a person that doesn't believe in eternity?",
    "I mean, does this eternity even exist?",
    "You might want to talk to a senior.",
    "That's it, Mr. Herkabe, you just broke the North High bank.",
    "Sometimes you're kissed by the gods.",
    "Your trip to the corndog cart has been comped.",
    "I should hope so.",
    "Ladies.",
    "I've been working hard, and I do care\nabout this, but all your stuff blows.",
    "Don't worry, Malcolm. Just go up there and do your best.",
    "And don't be nervous.\nNo one's expecting much.",
    "Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for\nthe Monte Carlo Night auction.",
    "Please gather around.",
    "It's a wonderful night and a wonderful cause.",
    "I have to say that the members of the North High Boosters\nhave really taught me so much about the true spirit of charity.",
    "So instead of the items listed in the program, we came up with\nsome new items, which I think people will be very excited to bid on.",
    "First item up: Our own Stephanie Wright has agreed to put\nup for auction, a photograph of herself from eighth grade...",
    "With her original nose!",
    "Ten dollars!",
    "- 20! 30! 40! 50!\n- 85 dollars!",
    "Sold!",
    "Next up: Wayne Finster, for the right price.",
    "Has volunteered to read out loud all the\nnotes his mother puts in his lunch every day.",
    "Five dollars! Ten! 25! 58 dollars and 25 cents!",
    "Sold!",
    "Next item: Our club president, Phillip, has agreed to show the video his\ndad took of him crying after he got pulled from the Madison football game.",
    "- 50 dollars! 60! 70! 80!\n- Sold!",
    "Over 200 dollars in 30 seconds. I think we've\nshown what the Booster spirit is really all about.",
    "That is so much money!",
    "We're raising so much money!",
    "For an extra 50 dollars, I'll throw in\na picture of me from before fat camp!",
    "- In a bikini!\n- 50 dollars! 60!",
    "- I also have notes from my shrink!\n- 80 bucks! 90!",
    "- And my dad taped me singing \"Skater Boy\" into a hairbrush!\n- 75 bucks! 80! 90!",
    "Our next item up for bid...",
    "is me.",
    "I will let the top bidder cover my mouth\nwith duct tape every morning for a week.",
    "90! 100! 120! 130! 160! 170!\n180! 200! 210! 240! 250!",
    "Well, that was quite an auction.",
    "Yeah. This was one of the best nights of my life.",
    "And I actually did something about myself.",
    "I was having this giant conflict about my principles,\nbut it was really just about my own pride.",
    "And all I had to do to fix it is get over myself.",
    "Excuse me.",
    "Hal?",
    "I've changed my mind.\nI do believe in heaven.",
    "I knew it!",
    "Oh, I always knew you believed in heaven.",
    "Keep the whistle. I'm good.",
    "Jamie, we need to talk.",
    "I'm calling a truce. I know you're willing\nto keep going it gets, and I respect that.",
    "But I realized something. Malcolm and Dewey are\nboth geniuses, so they're gonna team up against us.",
    "And since you and I are both mentally\nthe same, we should team up, too.",
    "Otherwise, they're gonna do something horrible to us,\nand we probably won't even  understand it.",
    "So...",
    "here.",
    "Hey, thanks.",

    "No, not the party.",

    "What do you want? I'll do anything.",
    "I want to go on a motorcycle\ntrip like you always talk about.",
    "Honey, that was way back in college.\nAnd you know how your mother feels...",
    "I want a motorcycle trip with my dad!",
    "Okay. Okay.",
    "I'll tell you what.",
    "When you turn 21, I promise I will take you on\nthe most awesome, special motorcycle trip, okay?",
    "We'll go when you turn 21.",
    "Oh, yeah.",
    "Motorcycle trip.",
    "At first I thought you were\njust saying it to shut me up.",
    "You're just saying this to shut me up.",
    "No, son, this is a promise.",
    "On the day of your 21st birthday, I swear by all that is holy,\nyou and I will go on a father-son motorcycle trip, so help me God.",
    "How are you going to get Mom to let you?",
    "I swear on my life, Francis, nothing will stop this.",
    "This is the holiest, most sacred promise between a father and a son.\nNothing, and I mean nothing, can ever undo this promise!",
    "- Boy, I sure liked to nail things down, didn't I?\n- Oh, yeah. It's going to be great.",
    "Wait, wasn't there...?",
    "This is sealed in blood.",
    "Do you hear me, son? Sealed in blood.",
    "Oh, crap.",
    "Okay, I'll pitch in three dollars\nfor Francis' birthday present.",
    "Me, too.",
    "And three from me.",
    "So we're agreed.",
    "We're giving Francis nine dollars for his birthday.",
    "Hey, your friend's outside.",
    "What do you mean \"friend\"?",
    "Your friend, Randy somebody. Really big kid.",
    "Randy Zane?",
    "Yeah, I think he wants to play baseball.",
    "What?",
    "He's outside right now with his bat.",
    "He seems really impatient.",
    "You know, I told you boys if you just\nmade an effort you could make friends.",
    "You see? You listened to me and it paid off.",
    "Just think how much easier your lives\nwould be if you listened to me all the time.",
    "God, he looks mad.",
    "Which one of us do you think he wants?",
    "Reese, it's obviously you.",
    "That must've been his bike that\nyou superglued to the train tracks.",
    "We don't know that.",
    "You were pretty fast and loose with\nthat dog-crap slingshot the other day.",
    "How do you know you didn't hit him?",
    "What about you?",
    "How many people did you convince\nto buy those algebra pills?",
    "You know, our lives would be a lot easier if\nwe didn't all pull this crap at the same time.",
    "I suggested a rotating calendar years ago,\nand you guys ignored me. And here we are.",
    "Let's just go tell Mom.",
    "We can't.",
    "If we send Mom out there, Randy will just tell her\nwhat we did, and then they'll both be after us.",
    "Did you see that movie where\nFreddie teamed up with Jason?",
    "Is that what you want?",
    "Then what do we do?",
    "He can't stand out there forever.\nWe'll just wait him out.",
    "So what if we have to stay inside for awhile.",
    "- Oh, my God, he's still out there.\n- I think he grew.",
    "Why is he smoking two cigarettes?",
    "Those are his eyes.",
    "Hal, what are you doing?",
    "I'm just trying to think of some wise\nthings to say to Francis tomorrow.",
    "A father should have some wisdom\nfor his son, don't you think?",
    "Well, it is a big day. You only turn 21 once.",
    "Hey, remember before he was born\nand I had that Harley Da...?",
    "No motorcycles ever!",
    "You do not talk about motorcycles.",
    "You do not think, you do not wish, you do not even\nreminisce about those stupid, idiotic death traps.",
    "They do not exist. Motorcycles do not exist.",
    "Say it.",
    "- Motorcycles do not exist.\n- What does not exist?",
    "- I don't know.\n- Good.",
    "He was out there all night.",
    "- Doesn't he get bored?\n- Do sharks get bored?",
    "You know what, we'll just stay\ninside all day today, too.",
    "We can last longer than he can.",
    "Mmm.",
    "So that's your famous pasta sauce\nFrancis talks so much about?",
    "Yeah, I only make it for birthdays and acquittals.",
    "One time it was both.",
    "I just love the smell of home cooking.",
    "Really?",
    "Do you know there's a way to get\nthat smell in your own house?",
    "Okay, it's all set up.",
    "The rental place is delivering two motorcycles\nto the gas station on 10th and Coolidge.",
    "I already have a couple of satchels packed.\nAt 5:30, we'll just slip out and disappear.",
    "This is so awesome.",
    "So Francis, your birthday dinner starts at 6:00.",
    "- I hope you're hungry.\n- Oh, gosh, I sure am.",
    "I'm hungry for all of it. My only problem will be\ndeciding which amazing side dish to eat first.",
    "But I guess I'll solve that problem at 6:00\n'cause that's when my birthday party starts.",
    "Be cool.",
    "We're going to be stuck in here forever.",
    "It'll be fine.",
    "Eventually, he'll get bored,\nor tired, or die of starvation.",
    "But who knows how long that could take?",
    "I'm going crazy here. I mean,\nlook at me, I'm reading a book.",
    "This is dumb.",
    "I'm not going to do this anymore.",
    "I'm just going to go out\nand see if it's me he wants.",
    "- What are you, nuts?\n- I'm not going to live like this.",
    "I've been beaten before.",
    "I'm just going to get it over with\nand live the rest of my life.",
    "God, he's walking right up to him.",
    "Randy's hitting him.",
    "He's hitting him. It's not us.",
    "You know, for a little kid,\nhe can really take a punch.",
    "I can't believe I've been going so easy on him.",
    "Give me the tape, and I'll get this side.",
    "Oh, I got it.",
    "This tape dispenser is tricky.\nIt'll take me longer to explain it.",
    "Dewey, are you okay?",
    "Boy, that was a beating.",
    "I mean, no offense to you guys, but \"wow.\"",
    "Why did he beat you up? Did he say?",
    "Actually, he said it wasn't me.",
    "Then why'd he eat you up?",
    "He said it was just a warm-up.",
    "Then he said to send out my brother.",
    "Which brother, me or Malcolm?",
    "He just said \"brother.\"",
    "Boy, what a weight off.",
    "It's just so great to have this\nover with. I'm finally free.",
    "And I'm getting some major tooth fairy money.",
    "You know, Hal, I realized this afternoon we don't have\nany pictures from any of Francis' birthday parties.",
    "I want you to make sure you have\nplenty of film in the camera.",
    "Will do. Get ready for a boatload of memories.",
    "Uh, Dad. Can you come out here for a second?",
    "No, no, no, no, no.",
    "These were supposed to go to the gas station.",
    "That's what I'm telling him.",
    "Look, this is the address that's on the credit card.",
    "But these can't be anywhere near here.",
    "You have to take them to the gas station.",
    "I'm not even insured to touch these\nthings once they're off the truck.",
    "But you know, you want them taken down\nto the gas station, they are motorcycles.",
    "Is everything okay out there, honey?",
    "Fine, no problem.",
    "Francis just wanted to make sure that we\nweren't wearing the same outfit tonight.",
    "Okay, just help me get these into the garage.",
    "Wow. Those are cool.",
    "Listen, do not say a word about this. If you just stay quiet, I promise\nwhen you turn 21, I will take you on a trip with me on a rocket ship.",
    "A rocket ship, Dewey.",
    "I swear on my life. I swear on everything\nthat is sacred, as God is my witness.",
    "Ow.",
    "Oh, how did you...? I don't care.",
    "Francis, come on, quickly.",
    "- How do I...?\n- Just kick it into neutral and follow me.",
    "Just turn left and gun it!",
    "I call you later.",
    "I love you.",
    "This should have been the greatest day of our lives.",
    "Dad and Francis rode motorcycles through\nthe living room, and where were we?",
    "Hiding under our beds.",
    "\"Oh, I'm really looking forward to dinner.\"",
    "What a jerk.",
    "I don't know what I'm gonna end up doing to him.",
    "All I know is every stroke of this\nbrush strengthens my killing arm.",
    "Do you have another bucket?",
    "I can get started on the tracks in the living room.",
    "Oh, I'll just end up redoing them all myself anyway.",
    "Why don't you just watch some TV?\nThen you'll be out of the way.",
    "Lois!",
    "No one is as useless as you think I am!",
    "My focus should be on hating my husband and planning\nrevenge, not worrying about whether I belong here.",
    "You are absolutely right.",
    "I'm sorry.",
    "You deserve better.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I appreciate that.",
    "So now what?",
    "Well, I don't know. We're kind\nof in uncharted waters here.",
    "- Drink?\n- Absolutely.",
    "Oh, man, what a day. What a ride.",
    "- That was fantastic!\n- Yeah.",
    "Just wait. Tomorrow we go around the lake to\nthis funky old hot springs you are gonna love.",
    "This is the same route I used to\ntake every month with my buddy, Roy,",
    "until he got dragged a quarter mile by that school bus.",
    "Thanks for doing this, Dad.",
    "You know, son, you should always pick\nbattles that are big enough to matter,",
    "but small enough to win.",
    "Yeah, okay.",
    "I say life is the only real counselor.",
    "Wisdom unfiltered through personal experience\ndoes not become part of the moral tissue.",
    "Dad, you feeling okay?",
    "Never mind.",
    "Listen, I have got something really special for you.",
    "You know, it's kind of a father-son\nthing to honor the occasion.",
    "It was a little expensive, but I am going to sit with\nmy 21-year-old son and share a 21-year-old bottle of Scotch.",
    "The guy at Liquor Clown said this was the best.",
    "Dad, I'm sorry. I'm sober now.\nI don't drink anymore.",
    "- What?\n- I'm sober now.",
    "I went to AA.",
    "What?",
    "When did this happen?",
    "Last year. It just became a problem, and",
    "I kind of bottomed out, so\nI decided to get some help, and,",
    "I've been sober\nfor six months now.",
    "And you didn't tell me about this?",
    "Well, I'm telling you now.",
    "What good is it to tell me now? I'm your father.\nYou could have come to me about this.",
    "Instead you go to a bunch of\nstrangers with drinking problems?",
    "Well, I'm sorry... I guess.",
    "Which one of the 12 steps is the one where\nyou act like your father doesn't exist?",
    "Dad, what's the big deal?\nIt was my problem.",
    "- I went, and I did what I needed to do to get help.\n- I'm supposed to help you.",
    "I deserved to know.",
    "And meanwhile, I plan this whole trip, and now I find out you're sober,\nand I'm standing here with a bottle of booze like some kind of jackass.",
    "You know, it's just a little tough... Wow.",
    "It's just little tough to find out.",
    "Do you have any other surprises for me?\nDo I have any grandchildren I never met?",
    "- Do you have a boyfriend?!\n- Dad, come on. This is a nice trip.",
    "I want to just enjoy this.",
    "I'm going to bed.",
    "I liked the thing you said about picking battles.",
    "I got it off a billboard.",
    "Oh, look at this. You got Francis a watch.",
    "That was so nice of you.",
    "This is a rare promotional Doobie Brothers EP.",
    "Oh. Hal almost cried when he found this at a yard sale.",
    "- It still doesn't seem like enough.\n- Oh, honey, this is just how we get the creative juices flowing.",
    "It's tough. You have to make your husband miserable, but I have to make\nmine miserable  and make it a warning to the other three boys in the house.",
    "- Do men ever think about what's gonna happen\nwhen they do these stupid things?\n- No, that's what's weird about men, they never do.",
    "I guarantee you those two won't even think\nabout the consequences of their actions",
    "until five minutes before they come home.",
    "So no matter how low I set the bar,\nhe'll still find a way to crawl under it?",
    "You still think there's a bar.",
    "That's so cute.",
    "Look at him, sleeping peacefully while\nI'm sitting here going through hell.",
    "It's not fair.",
    "God, when did this room get so small? I hate this.",
    "- Reese, come on, go to sleep.\n- I can't. I just keep thinking about the beating.",
    "How long it'll hurt, how bad\nit'll be, when it's gonna happen.",
    "What if it's on the Fourth of July? That'll ruin it.",
    "- I was gonna have pie.\n- Dude, you have to calm down.",
    "- We can wait it out. We can beat this.\n- I can't take this anymore.",
    "I'm going out there. It's probably me he wants, anyway.",
    "- Reese, that's stupid. There is no logic in that.\n- Yes, there is.",
    "He is just getting madder and madder. And the longer\nhe has to wait, the worse the beating is going to be.",
    "Reese, think about it. Dewey got beat up\neven though Randy wasn't after him.",
    "If you go out there now, he'll beat you up even if you're not\nthe one he wants, just to send a message to me.",
    "I don't care anymore.",
    "But if you just wait, I'll figure out a way to get out of this.",
    "I am not gonna wait while you keep trying to come up\nwith some plan that you'll never come up with.",
    "I have to live in the real world.",
    "This mud feels fantastic, doesn't it?",
    "It's so soothing, I don't even care about all\nthe hundreds of people who left their pubes in here.",
    "Come on, Dad. We should be making the most of this.",
    "You sulked all the way here, you sulked all the way through the\ncold plunge, you even sulked when they beat us with juniper branches.",
    "Stop being such a baby.",
    "I'm sorry I had such high expectations for this trip.",
    "For all the trouble I went to, I thought maybe\nI could maybe be an important part of your life.",
    "This has been a nice trip, Dad.\nThis is exactly how I was hoping it would be.",
    "It just gets to me, Francis. I mean, how did we get to\nthis point where you're doing all this stuff without me?",
    "I mean, you're-you're traveling everywhere, you're getting\nmarried, you're doing all these things without even telling me.",
    "- And now I find out you even went to AA without telling me?\n- I can't help it, Dad. I'm a grown-up now. It happens.",
    "And I missed it.",
    "I mean, here you've grown into this nice, responsible,\ndecent man, and I didn't get to be there for it.",
    "I missed you being there, too, Dad.",
    "It kind of makes me happy you feel sad about it.",
    "- Well, that's something anyway.\n- Yeah.",
    "Five minutes.",
    "Holy crap, we've got to get back home!\nDo you realize how much trouble we're in?",
    "Oh, God, you're right. We're dead. We can't go back.",
    "No, no, no, no, wait. I'll think of something. I've been\nmarried for 20 years, and I've gotten out of a lot of trouble.",
    "- Wait, how is it 20 years if I'm 21?\n- Just shut up and let me think.",
    "- Okay. I have something.\n- What?",
    "Ow! God. What the hell was that for?",
    "You were in a terrible motorcycle\naccident that taught you a lesson.",
    "Now it's not gonna solve everything, but it's gonna make\nyour apology go down a lot easier because it makes them right,",
    "which is what they really want.",
    "- Dad, you're brilliant.\n- There's no time for that. Just do me now.",
    "You're gonna want to grab between the second and\nthird knuckle, and go up and back in one smooth motion.",
    "But just these two so I can still work the throttle.",
    "- I love you, Dad.\n- I love you, too, son.",
    "- You were right, Dewey. I can't tell you how much better I feel.\n- Told ya.",
    "It's really freeing. Especially knowing\nhe still wants the other brother.",
    "Malcolm, you got to go out there. It's time. He wants you.",
    "No. By October, I'll be strong enough to beat him.",
    "Come on, Malcolm. You have school tomorrow. You can pretend to\nbe sick for a few days, but sooner or later, Mom gets involved.",
    "- Then what?\n- I'll think of something.",
    "Thinking won't do it, Malcolm. This is\nnot a smart thing. It's a life thing.",
    "Randy is like an earthquake.\nIt's just something that's gonna happen.",
    "Seriously, Malcolm, the longer you try to put this off,\nthe worse it's gonna to be.",
    "I could tell he was holding back.\nHe's got a lot farther he could go.",
    "- This is nothing.\n- No, I'm not giving up. I don't give up.",
    "I'm not a quitter. If I have a problem, I think\nand work and keep working on it until I solve it.",
    "Okay, name one time that's ever worked out for you.",
    "Well... ",
    "Did it work five years ago when your hamster died, and\nyou spent so many hours giving it CPR that the doctors\nhad to put a shunt in your mouth to help the sores drain?",

    "No, but I could... I could...",
    "Malcolm, think about it.",
    "You're right.",
    "I really have to go out there.",
    "I appreciate you guys looking out for me.",
    "We didn't think you'd be so easy to convince.",
    "No, not him. Where's the red-haired brother?",
    "- There is no red-haired brother. This is it.\n- Shoot. I have the wrong house.",
    "Where's that house with the assbag\nwho works with handicapped kids?",
    "Oh, that's Eddie Jeffers. He lives on Comstock.",
    "You guys got pounded, and I got off scot-free.\nHah! Now whose philosophy looks stupid?",
    "You thought I couldn't come up with...",
    "Guys, wait. What if we do this tomorrow?\nYou'll be rested. Take some time first.",

    "Not now, Craig.",
    "I figured it out.\nI know what's going on.",
    "The store is haunted.",
    "Craig...",

    "We don't sell this stuff.",
    "Okay, fine.",
    "If you must know,\nI was restocking my locker.",

    "And now that you've publicly humiliated\nme, can I go about my business?",
    "Okay, not bad. It's plausible,\nembarrassing enough for the outburst,\nand essentially unprovable.",
    "I just have to stand my ground.",
    "Attention Lucky\nAide trespasser.",
    "You do not get to do this.\nYou do not get to live off the grid.",

    "No one gets to shirk their\nshare of the misery.",
    "Everyone has to be stuck\nin this together. That's what's fair.\nThose are the rules.",
    "Now, you obviously know me, so you\nknow what I'm willing to do to find you.",
    "So save us both the\ntime and come out now.",
    "Let me handle this.",
    "Do you know anything about\na guy living in the store?",
    "No!",
    "No, Reese, you're not\ncoming in here with those.",
    "But they'll freeze\nto death out there!",
    "I'm sorry, son. I already promised\nyour mom I would get rid of them.",
    "And I have four or five other lies\nin the fire I can't jeopardize.",
    "The bugs stay outside.",
    "Fine.",
    "Then I'll...",
    "I'll... I'll fight you for it.",
    "Reese, you already fought me\nfor the last English muffin two\nweeks ago, and I cleaned your clock.",
    "But this time, I'm fighting for\nsomething I love even more\nthan those muffins.",
    "Keep your voice down.\nYou're going to wake Jamie.",
    "Good. I want him to hear what kind of\nheartless monster his father really is.",
    "Come on, old man, let's go.",
    "All right. But if I throw my back\nout again beating you up, I am\ngoing to kick the crap out of you.",
    "Well, the police\nare on their way.",

    "You've got to learn to chew.",
    "Easier said, my friend.",

    "He didn't even really\ndo anything wrong.",
    "He paid for everything he took.",
    "He helped out around the store.\nThe guy's just living here.",
    "What's wrong with that?",
    "I could just disappear, go to\nthe Wal-Mart down the block.\nI've heard great things about them.",
    "He broke the rules, Malcolm.",
    "The rules matter.",
    "Rules say we get paid time and\na half for the graveyard shift.",
    "The rules say trespassers\nare dealt with by the police.",
    "You can't just pick and choose what\nrules you want to follow, or the whole\nsystem breaks down.",

    "But as long as I'm working here,\nI can't bend the rules for anyone.",
    "7:30. Shift's over.",
    "What are you doing?",
    "I'm off the clock.\nI'm going home.",

    "-Thank you.\n-For what?",
    "Great. She lets that guy walk, but makes\na federal case whenever I put my phone\nnumber in with the birth control pills.",
    "-Hi, Malcolm.\n-Oh, hey, Wendy.",
    "Did you get the blue\nirises I sent you?",
    "Yeah, I did.",
    "How did you know those\nwere my favorite flowers?",
    "Well, you know, I guess we just\nreally have a lot in common.",
    "Like loving grilled cheese and tomato\nsandwiches and Stephen King books.",

    "What the hell are you doing?",
    "Following me around?\nAre you stalking me?",
    "No. No, no.\nI guess we're just really in sync.",

    "Don't worry, buddy.",
    "Even I get that sometimes.",
    "Dad, the toilet lid was up,\nand Jamie's tongue is blue again.",

    "You might as well wipe yourself with\nthe beard of the Most Holy Patriarch.",
    "Why is my tart vomit?",
    "Stop your temper tantrum!",
    "Look here. The 15th\nlayer... you put apricots.",
    "Is that correct?",
    "The Saint didn't slaughter the\npeacemakers on the 15th. He waited\ntill the 16th when they trusted him.",
    "This thing has, like, 35 layers.\nWho's gonna know where the apricots are?",

    "It's totally fair.",
    "You just hate that you don't\nget to be better than everybody\nat everything all the time.",
    "Music's my only thing.\nAnd you know what?",
    "It's greater than everything you\nhave put together, because it's\nabout beauty and love and feeling,",

    "But I think it's simple fairness.",
    "I don't know what you're talking\nabout. Just say what you mean.",
    "You seem confused.",
    "You want me to help you?",
    "Well, let's see if I can\nmake it loud and clear.",
    "I can't do it.",
    "I guess I'm just a better\nperson than you are.",
    "You know, there's some diabetes medicine\nin the fridge you may want to destroy.",
    "I am not going to be the\nbad guy in this, Mother.",
    "I just want to understand\nmy daughter's behavior.",
    "Why are you so frustrated?",

    "What?",
    "No, I was getting the oil\nstains out of the driveway.",
    "For your information,\nmarriage isn't just about sex.",
    "It's about commitment.",
    "Anyway, you know we can't have\nsex until after the waiting period.",
    "The waiting period?",
    "Poor, naive Malcolm.",

    "You do?",
    "Why are you saying that?",
    "Well, I'm giving you my blessing.",
    "I see what's happening here.",
    "You're using reverse psychology.",
    "It's not working.",
    "No, I'm really just saying that\nI like her, and I like how you\nare when you're with her.",
    "Nice try, Mom, but\nI'm staying with Raduca.",
    "And I approve.",
    "You'd like me to think\nso, wouldn't you?",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "Well, I'm staying with her, Mom.",

    "So you know what\nI should do better than I do.",
    "You're just like Mom.",
    "Maybe Mom has a point.",
    "Maybe just hanging out by\nthe pool isn't going to be the\nstepping-stone you're hoping for.",
    "You never supported me!",
    "All I'm saying is jobs don't\njust drop out of the sky.",
    "I hate you!",

    "Don't let me fall!",
    "Okay, I think we've\nmade a lot of progress!",

    "This is about the\ndental visit, isn't it?",
    "You know, I don't\nrecall a dental visit.",
    "I recall a mugging!",
    "I'm surprised you'd bring it up,\nconsidering you ran out on the bill.",
    "-Con artist!\n-Welsher!",
    "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\nWhat's this about?",
    "I went to Trey to get my tooth\nfixed for free like he promised,",
    "and then this pirate\nhands me a bill for $2,000!",
    "Free?! I never said\nI'd fix it for free!",
    "-You said you'd take care of it!\n-And I took care of it!",
    "I fixed it!",

    "The man said he'd take care of it.",
    "Everyone knows what that means.",
    "Yeah, it means he'd fix it for free.",
    "Thank you!",
    "You're just saying that because it\nwas your cheap-ass caramel corn\nthat broke his tooth in the first place.",
    "It had nothing to do\nwith the caramel corn!",
    "Guys, guys, guys,\nthis is ruining the game.",
    "Malik, you do mediation\nat your law firm.",
    "-Can't you help out?\n-Fine.",
    "Fellas, I want you both to just sit\ndown and listen to each other.",
    "Trey, can't you see where \"I'll take\ncare of it\" could be misinterpreted?",
    "-Well, I suppose it could.\n-Yeah!",
    "And, Hal, can't you see\nthat Trey is a professional?",
    "He went to years of medical school.",
    "And then he gave up\nand became a dentist.",
    "Trey deserves to be\ncompensated for his work.",
    "It's natural and it's fair.",
    "I guess it is.",
    "I'm sorry, Trey.",
    "No offense taken.",
    "So, Malik, how much do we owe you?",
    "Ah, nothing. We're friends.",
    "A-ha! You see?",
    "It's not the same!",
    "You came to me as a professional.",

    "That's it!",
    "I don't want your repo thugs\ncoming after me, so here!",
    "So, Peterson puts the report\non my desk and says, uh...",
    "Hal, if your tooth hurts, don't eat.",
    "I'm fine.",
    "-Hal, just stop it.\n-Stop what?",
    "We're all afraid you're\ngoing to choke to death.",
    "-You can't eat if you don't chew.\n-I don't need to chew.",
    "I am fine.",
    "The key is relaxing\nthe esophagus.",
    "Jamie, I hope you're\npaying attention.",
    "So, Mom, how's the\nbike-a-thon going?",
    "Just great.",
    "-I'm really excited about it.\n-You are, huh?",
    "How long have you been riding?",
    "Long enough.",
    "Fascinating!",
    "Hey, you know what I could go for?",
    "Another piece of cake.",
    "There is no more.",
    "-What about that piece?\n-My piece?",
    "That's okay. I don't need\nanother piece of cake.",
    "I can just continue talking.",
    "So, what was I talking about?",
    "Oh, yeah, your bike riding.",
    "These chairs are so uncomfortable.",
    "They have no idea how\nto conform to our bodies.",
    "Hal, you have an infection.\nYou have to see a dentist.",
    "I made an appointment with\nDr. Voorhees tomorrow.",
    "Isn't that the guy we\ntook Dewey's hamster to?",
    "He's a doctor.",
    "If he isn't in the society pages, then\nyou're not impressed, huh, Lois?",
    "Go back to Trey!",
    "-We'll find the money somehow.\n-No way!",
    "Well, you are going to have to\nfind some way to deal with this.",
    "I know and I have.",
    "I'm not an idiot, Lois.",
    "Now, please, will you\nhand me my scream box?",
    "Hey, what's all the noise?",
    "You know the rule.",

    "I got there in time to get a program off the\nfloor and see his ambulance drive away.",
    "Oh, well.",

    "Fine! More room for me.",
    "So that's your plan?",
    "You're going to sleep\nfor the rest of your life?",
    "That's pretty pathetic.",
    "I'll leave my mark.",
    "Long after I'm gone, the memory\ncoils in this bed will still remember\nthe contours of my body.",
    "Listen to yourself. That's insane.",
    "This bed is evil.",
    "It's draining your soul, Malcolm!",
    "Malcolm?",
    "Okay, Mom, I think today we might break\nthe 12-inch distance record we set yesterday.",
    "It's white-knuckle time.",
    "I'm not doing this anymore.",
    "-What?!\n-You know I can't do it.",
    "I just cannot get on that\nbike again. It's just too hard.",
    "Oh, it's too hard?",
    "Well, why didn't you say so?",
    "When things get tough, you got to just\ngive up and run away from your dreams.",
    "Lower your expectations.",
    "That's fine. I've had my fun.",
    "If you want to quit, go ahead and quit.",
    "All right, Reese, you made\nyour point. Let's give it a try.",
    "No, I was really saying quit.",

    "No, we sure won't.",
    "Seems like only yesterday you\nand I were going to homecoming,",
    "putting the school paper to bed, fretting\nover our first big date with Sharon Hines.",
    "That kiss went on forever.",
    "Uh, Mr. Kenarban, Stevie's supposed\nto help me work on my speech.",
    "Right, right.",
    "Mr. Valedictorian.",
    "Congratulations again.",
    "I'm glad my son can help you out\nwith your big, important speech.",
    "It's probably that selflessness\nthat got him the second spot.",
    "Dad!",
    "I'm not insulting salutatorian. It's...",
    "It's quite an honor.",
    "I'm just glad that even after I got\nCedric Hampton to be the school's\ncommencement speaker,",

    "What?",
    "We can get rid of\nthe nuclear option.",
    "-Oh, my God.\n-You're right.",
    "What's the... nuclear option?",
    "Evidence of the worst\nthing we ever did.",
    "This is what made sure that no matter\nhow bad we screwed each other over,",
    "there was always a limit.",
    "None of us could push anyone to a\npoint where they had nothing to lose.",
    "Or they'd just pull the trigger\nand destroy all of us.",
    "How bad... can it be?",
    "One time we made Mom\nthink... she had cancer.",
    "But we had a really good reason.",
    "Stop saying it'll be all right!",
    "You'll never be able\nto raise them alone!",
    "Mom, I know this\nis a bad time, but...",

    "I just need $5,000.",
    "You think I would be calling\nyou if I wasn't desperate?",
    "Look, I know how much\nyou hate me, but...",
    "No kidding, I'm at rock bottom.",
    "I've got no money, no prospects\nand nowhere else to turn.",
    "Well...",
    "Can I speak to a senior loan officer?",
    "So, 3:15 you make the last\nround of the bathrooms.",
    "Toilet 12 is a bit of a diva.",
    "Then you rinse your mop in hot water and\ndisinfectant, and you hang it on a yellow peg.",
    "Any questions?",
    "Yeah. Why would you ever go home?",
    "This job is better than\nI could ever imagine.",

    "Don't get too excited, kid.",
    "You'll be gone after 30 days.",
    "Oh, no, I am really committed to this.",
    "No, no, no, you don't understand.",
    "This is a union gig.",
    "Once you get past the 30-day\nprobation, you're locked for life.",
    "Full benefits, medical, everything.",
    "So they never keep a new\nguy for more than a month.",
    "Hey, I'm sorry, kid.",
    "You really seem to\nbe a natural at this.",
    "I've never seen anybody take\nto garbage the way you do.",
    "There's got to be some way.",
    "I mean... I mean, what\nif there was a mess...",
    "a mess that was so big\nand sticky and disgusting,",
    "that it was impossible to\nclean up in less than 30 days?",
    "It's a beautiful thought, kid.",
    "But there's no such\nthing as a 30-day mess.",
    "Yeah?",
    "Well, they also said they'd\nnever put a man on Mars.",
    "Sorry we're late.",
    "You wouldn't believe the fight\nwe got in over shower curtains.",
    "Those dolphins were gay.",
    "You think all dolphins are gay.",
    "All dolphins are gay.",

    "Can we begin?",
    "With this fire, a terrible secret that\nbound us together is gone forever.",
    "Jamie will grow up in a world without the\nfear that haunted every second of our lives.",
    "He'll learn to give birthday presents\nout of love, not blackmail,",
    "and to share out of the generosity\nof his heart, not the dread\nin the pit of his stomach.",
    "With this fire, a curse is lifted\nand a brilliant new dawn is born.",
    "-Amen.\n-Amen.",
    "Nice touch.",
    "You know, if you want me to take a look\nat your valedictory speech, I'd be happy to.",
    "Mom, stop it.",
    "I don't want anyone to\nsee it until it's ready.",
    "Fine.",
    "But if you ever want\nsome fresh ears...",
    "No, I'm really happy with it.\nJust let me do this.",
    "Okay, okay.",
    "But why are you quoting a rap\ngroup when there are people",
    "like Paul McCartney out there\nwho are just as relevant",
    "and don't go around showing\noff the tops of their underpants?",
    "It's a start.",
    "Susan, I'm sorry.",
    "Mom just bullied me into giving\nher our last ticket for graduation.",
    "Because the last time I stood\nup to her someone dumped a\npig's head down our chimney.",
    "Besides, she's already on her way.",
    "She's driving down\nwith Francis and Piama.",
    "Lois, I really think he's going to do\nit this time! You've got to stop him!",
    "There you are.",
    "I drove by 80 miles of blunt\nobjects just to get to you.",
    "I hope you run!",
    "You better make that first\nswing count, Princess.",
    "Hi, Mom.",
    "Finish your cigarette and\nI'll make you some lunch.",

    "I don't know why those\ntwo can't get along...",
    "You had to make\na speech first, didn't you?",
    "Hal...",
    "Right.",
    "Son, don't feel bad.",
    "In some parallel universe, you did it.",
    "Oh, no.",
    "They canceled my Pierson Grant.",
    "That was $3,000!",
    "They're using the money to\ndo a study on what happens\nto kids who can't afford college.",
    "They're offering me\n50 dollars to be a part of it.",
    "Show it to me.",
    "It's beautiful, Grandma.",
    "I just cracked the lid a quarter inch\nand it burned off all the hair in my nose.",
    "Good. Who takes the fall?",
    "Huh?",
    "Your patsy...\nwho is your patsy?",
    "It's a good thing you called me.",
    "If you're going to make this big mess,\nthey're going to blame someone.",
    "And you can make it anyone you want.",
    "A teacher, a neighbor.",
    "If you're lucky,\na whole family goes down.",
    "And you get to sell their dog.",
    "You are amazing.",
    "If you ever brushed\nyour teeth, I would kiss you.",
    "You want 8,000 dollars?",
    "Yes.",
    "All right, the way this works\nis you come back next week...",
    "That won't be necessary.",
    "I'm not going to pay you back.",
    "Hear me out.",
    "There's no way I can get\nthe money to pay you,",
    "but instead of making you go\nthrough that whole, stupid charade\nwhere you keep calling me",
    "and I keep making lame\nexcuses until you hunt me down,",
    "I am willing to go straight\nto the leg-breaking.",
    "Really?",
    "Yes.",
    "Whenever you say, I just show up\nand you start snapping bones.",
    "Arms, legs, whatever.",
    "Invite anyone you want.",
    "I promise, I will scream and\ncry and beg for mercy,",
    "and make it so loud and so horrible\nthat no one who sees it will ever\nmiss another payment again.",
    "Now, you can't buy\nthat kind of publicity.",
    "Couldn't I just not give you the money\nand still break your arms and legs?",
    "Wouldn't that accomplish the same thing?",
    "True. But...",
    "Then I think your point\nstarts to get muddled.",
    "Maybe we should sleep on it.",
    "Will you straighten\nup those magazines?",
    "The Kenarbans will be here any\nminute and I don't want their fancy\nfriend to think he's visiting a hobo camp.",
    "Yeah, Mom, let's all jump through\nhoops so the big corporate fat cat\ndoesn't have to see anything real.",
    "You know, Francis, it wouldn't hurt\nyou to jump through a hoop or two.",
    "Are you even still looking for a job?",
    "As a matter of fact...",
    "As a matter of fact, I don't have to.",
    "I got a lot of irons in the fire\nright now. I got three different\nideas for children's books,",
    "and I'm considering applying\nfor a bounty hunter's license.",
    "Are you insane?!",
    "In what world is that even remotel...?",
    "Piama, will you help me get\nthe good china on the closet ?",
    "I love finally having\nan excuse to use these.",
    "I took them out once when that\ncongressman was going door to door but,",
    "he just clogged up\nour toilet and left.",
    "By the way, Mom, I think it's high time\nwe cleared the air about that day",
    "you threw away my Harlem\nGlobetrotter autographs.",
    "Harlem who? What are you talking about?",
    "I'm not saying there was definitely\nsome unconscious racism going on,",
    "but I do think someone could benefit from\na little self-examination in a quiet moment.",
    "Dewey, can I see you in\nyour room for a second?",
    "Okay, it's pretty obvious\nI just saved your ass.",
    "Now I want to know why.",

    "I love you, Grandma.",
    "You're a good boy.",
    "Are you kidding me? That\nwhole cancer scare was fake?!",
    "I played cards with her in\nthe hospital for no reason?",
    "Why didn't you just get rid of this?",
    "I don't know.",
    "I couldn't.",
    "The thought of destroying\nit just made me... sad.",
    "I get it, Dewey.",
    "You love your brothers.",
    "You didn't have much to keep\nyou together, but you had this.",
    "And now I have this.",
    "Something really horrible to blackmail\nyou guys with that I'm totally clean on.",

    "We're good.",
    "So Mr. Hampton,",
    "You got all the subroutines,\nthe GUI, all of that into 16K?",
    "I can't get a Boolean sort in that.",
    "You youngsters are spoiled\nby all that cheap RAM.",
    "When I started out, I had an 8-bit\nbus that ran at 4.7 megahertz,\nand I was happy to have it.",
    "This is fantastic.",
    "I haven't understood a word\nyou've said for the last ten minutes.",
    "Oh, you don't have to be that impressed.",
    "Sure, now he owns a GulfStream\njet and a baseball team,",
    "but there was a time when this\nguy's name was Accident Pants.",
    "Remember that?",
    "Remember that?",
    "I remember somebody\nbegging me for a loan.",
    "Remember that?",
    "Remember that?",
    "Now, listen, I'm really\nnot here to socialize.",
    "I've seen some of the\nprogramming you boys have done.",
    "The server-to-server algorithm. The\nevolution simulator, that's all good stuff.",
    "He thinks...",
    "we're geniuses.",
    "Well, good enough for\na two-year contract, anyway.",
    "Full benefits, stock options.",
    "We're talking six figures-- each.",
    "Oh, my God!",
    "Wait, how many is six?",
    "I'm not being charitable.",
    "I'm locking you in while you're still\ncheap, but I need an answer right now.",
    "Otherwise it's not worth it to me.",
    "Well, I...",
    "That's a very generous\noffer, Mr. Hampton, but no.",
    "Mom, what are you...?",
    "Malcolm's going to college,\nhe's going to finish his education.",
    "But thank you very much.",
    "He wasn't asking you, he was...",
    "Ma'am, I completely understand.",
    "I should have talked to you first.",
    "Consider the offer withdrawn.",
    "Sorry, kid. 24/seven job. You'd need\nyour whole family behind you.",
    "And don't be mad at your mom.\nShe's only trying to look out for you.",
    "Who knows how far I would've\ngone if I went to college?",
    "What's that noise?",
    "Nothing, Dad.\nJust a little hungry.",
    "All right, Malcolm,\nI know you're angry.",
    "You might as well say what you have\nto now and get it out of your system.",
    "Oh, my eyes!",
    "I'm so sorry, Jamie.",
    "I didn't know I had you hanging upside\ndown until that last layer of gunk came off.",

    "Good job, Reese.",

    "Those are my hopes and dreams\nyou're scrubbing out of your cracks!",
    "Anybody else hungry?",
    "Oh, mother...",
    "You know what?",
    "I'm glad!",
    "This is appropriate.",
    "Now my life looks\nexactly how I feel.",
    "How could you screw me over like that?",
    "Because you were\ngoing to take that job,",
    "and we are not going to\nlet you throw your life away.",
    "How is being rich throwing my life away?!",
    "Because it's not the life\nyou're supposed to have!",
    "The life you're supposed to\nhave is you go to Harvard,",
    "and you earn every fellowship\nand internship they have.",
    "You graduate first in your class,\nand you start working in public service,",
    "either district attorney or\nrunning some foundation,",
    "and then you become\ngovernor of a mid-sized state,",
    "and then you become president.",
    "What?!",
    "Of the United States.",
    "Dad?",
    "I'm sorry, son. It's true.",
    "I thought you knew.",
    "Our expectations started out much smaller,\nbut you just kept upping the ante.",
    "What if I don't want to be president?",
    "It's too late that.\nYou're gonna do it.",
    "Oh, really?",
    "Have you decided my position\non capital-gains tax cuts?",
    "What are my foreign policy objectives?!",
    "That doesn't matter.",
    "What does matter is you'll be the only\nperson in that position who will ever\ngive a crap about people like us.",
    "We've been getting the short end\nof the stick for thousands of years,\nand I, for one, am sick of it.",
    "Now, you are going to be president,\nmister, and that's the end of it.",
    "Did it ever occured to you that\nI could have taken this job,",
    "gotten really rich and then bought\nmy way into being president?",
    "Of course it did.",
    "We decided against it.",
    "What?!",
    "Because then you wouldn't\nbe a good president.",
    "You wouldn't have suffered enough.",
    "I've been suffering all my life.",
    "I'm sorry, it's not enough.",
    "You know what it's like to be poor,\nand you know what it's like to work hard.",
    "Now you're going to learn what\nit's like to sweep floors and",
    "bust your ass and accomplish twice\nas much as all the kids around you.",
    "And it won't mean anything because\nthey will still look down on you.",
    "And you will want so much for\nthem to like you, and they just won't.",
    "And it'll break your heart.",
    "And that'll make your heart bigger and\nopen your eyes and finally you will realize",
    "that there's more to life than proving\nyou're the smartest person in the world.",
    "I'm sorry, Malcolm, but you\ndon't get the easy path.",
    "You don't get to just have fun and\nbe rich and live the life of luxury.",
    "That's Dewey.",
    "Really?",
    "This is unbelievable.",
    "You actually expect me to be president.",
    "No, no, I'm sorry.",
    "You expect me to be one of the greatest\npresidents in the history of the United States.",
    "You look me in the eye and\nyou tell me you can't do it.",
    "And as the Dalai Lama eloquently\nstated last summer on my yacht,",
    "\"Wisdom is the light by day,",
    "vertue is the protection by night",
    "And as we go down the path of life,\nthere's often confusion and fear,",
    "because we fail to remember that\nwe have this Wisdom within us.",
    "It's there to call on,",
    "to get us through the\ndark night of the soul,",
    "to help us achieve a new dawn\nwith new possibilities...",

    "What's that?",
    "Shh!",
    "It's my employee badge.",
    "Please don't tell Mom,\nit'd make her too happy.",
    "She'd never let\nme live it down.",
    "You got a job?",
    "For the last two months.",
    "It's at this giant corporation.",
    "I'm in this tiny little cubicle, surrounded\nby hundreds of other tiny little cubicles,",

    "Most of us have been\ndreaming of this day for years,",

    "there's no escape.",
    "Our families are\ncoming with us.",

    "Oh, Hal, for God's\nsake, don't touch it!",
    "Man, if Mom ever found\nout it was the two of us...",
    "Hey...",
