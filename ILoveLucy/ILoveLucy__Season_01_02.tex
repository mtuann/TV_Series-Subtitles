\subsection {Episode 00: Pilot (1951)}
1 - In this city live Lucy and Ricky
Ricardo.\\
2 - Of course, you know Ricky\\
3 - as a famous orchestra leader and
singer\\
4 - and Lucy as the famous, uh...\\
5 - Well, she's...
her hair is very red,\\
6 - and she's married to Ricky.\\
7 - In this district, close to theaters\\
8 - and nightclubs where Ricky works,\\
9 - they have a little apartment\\
10 - where they laugh, love, and
thoroughly enjoy life.\\
11 - They live in this apartment here on
the seventh floor.\\
12 - Now, let's look in.\\
13 - No, no, no, not that apartment.\\
14 - Yes, that's right.\\
15 - Okay.\\
16 - It's 11:00 now.\\
17 - They should be getting up.\\
18 - Ricky is one of those individuals\\
19 - who wakes up in the morning bright
and cheery.\\
20 - On the other hand,\\
21 - Lucy is one of those individuals\\
22 - who, when she wakes up in the
morning...\\
23 - He looks like he got in later than I
did.\\
24 - I wonder whatever happened to my
type.\\
25 - Ricky? Ricky?\\
26 - Ricky?!\\
27 - Yes, Lucy, what is it?\\
28 - If you had known how I look in the
morning,\\
29 - would you still have married me?\\
30 - Well, would you?\\
31 - I'm trying to decide.\\
32 - I was just teasing you, honey.\\
33 - You look beautiful to me all the
time.\\
34 - You were not "tizzing" me.\\
35 - I know you, Ricky Ricardo.\\
36 - Just because you're going to be a big
television star,\\
37 - you're casting me aside like an old
shoe.\\
38 - Now, please, don't talk about it
until it happens.\\
39 - What do you want to do, "jints" me?\\
40 - "Jints you?"\\
41 - Yeah, jints.\\
42 - J-I-N... um... um...\\
43 - "X?"\\
44 - "X?" Don't be ridiculous.\\
45 - I don't have to spell it.\\
46 - It means "bad luck."\\
47 - Some sponsors are coming to the club
to see my show,\\
48 - and if they like it, they'll put it
on television.
That's all.\\
49 - What night are they coming?
Do you know?\\
50 - No.\\
51 - You do, too.\\
52 - I do not.\\
53 - They're going to tell my agent,\\
54 - and Jerry will tell me as soon as he
knows.\\
55 - Well, it doesn't matter.\\
56 - You'll never be a success on
television anyway.\\
57 - What?\\
58 - What do you mean\\
59 - I won't be a success on television?\\
60 - You don't have a pretty girl in your
act.\\
61 - Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi, here we go again.\\
62 - On television, you have to have a
pretty girl\\
63 - to demonstrate the sponsor's product.\\
64 - Yeah?\\
65 - Sure-- she eats it or drinks it or
smokes it\\
66 - or waxes the floor with it or cuts
potatoes with it\\
67 - or drives off in it.\\
68 - Sure. How would you like to have your
sponsor's product\\
69 - demonstrated by a gorgeous redhead?\\
70 - I'd love it.\\
71 - You know where I can find one?\\
72 - Ah...
Ay!\\
73 - Oh, Ricky, stop.\\
74 - You're getting lather all over.\\
75 - Never mind that.\\
76 - Help me find my ear.\\
77 - You didn't really lose an ear.\\
78 - Huh?\\
79 - Stop.\\
80 - Okay, you talked me into it.\\
81 - You can demonstrate the sponsor's
product on the show.\\
82 - Good. What is it?\\
83 - Men's shorts.\\
84 - Oh...\\
85 - Now, look, Lucy, you know how I feel
about this.\\
86 - I don't want my wife in show
business.\\
87 - Why?\\
88 - Why?\\
89 - I asked you first.\\
90 - Oh, honey, we've been over this
10,000 times.\\
91 - I want a wife who is just a wife.\\
92 - Now, look, all you got to do is clean
the house for me,\\
93 - hand me my pipe when I come home at
night,\\
94 - cook for me, and be the mama for my
children.\\
95 - You don't smoke a pipe.\\
96 - It doesn't matter.\\
97 - Just do the others.\\
98 - You're missing a good bet.\\
99 - I say you're missing a good bet.\\
100 - Am I?\\
101 - Yeah.\\
102 - How do you figure?\\
103 - Because I can sing.\\
104 - Huh?\\
105 - And dance.\\
106 - What else?\\
107 - And tell jokes.\\
108 - How about it?\\
109 - No.\\
110 - Oh, you have no imagination.\\
111 - I'll bet if Ziegfeld or Earl Carroll
had seen me,\\
112 - they'd sign me up like that.\\
113 - As what?\\
114 - As a beautiful showgirl.\\
115 - Go answer the door.\\
116 - Hello, Jerry.\\
117 - Hiya, baby.\\
118 - Well, this is it, boy.\\
119 - Tonight is the night!\\
120 - This is it!
Tonight is the night!\\
121 - S-S-Shh!\\
122 - What do you mean, "Shoosh"?\\
123 - Shout it from the housetops, boy.
This is it!\\
124 - Tonight is the night the sponsors are
coming down\\
125 - to catch your show for TV.\\
126 - Fine, fine, but I don't want Lucy to
hear.\\
127 - If she knows the audition is tonight,\\
128 - she'll pester the life out of me.\\
129 - Oh, I see.\\
130 - Well, have you got everything all
set?\\
131 - Sure, everything's fine.\\
132 - Can you get that clown act\\
133 - you want to put in the show?\\
134 - You mean Pepito?\\
135 - Yeah, Pepito, the fella that rides on
the bicycle.\\
136 - Yeah, I'll have him do the bicycle
act,\\
137 - and then he can do that cello bit.\\
138 - That's good. Fine.\\
139 - Then everything is all taken care of,
huh?\\
140 - Everything's fine.\\
141 - Okay, I'll see you down at the club
later.\\
142 - All right, Jerry.\\
143 - Good. Yeah.
Bye-bye.\\
144 - Oh, ooh! I almost forgot.\\
145 - The lawyer gave me this yesterday.\\
146 - He wants you and Lucy to...
hey, what am I whispering for?\\
147 - He wants you and Lucy to sign it,\\
148 - and I'll take it right back to him.\\
149 - What is it?\\
150 - Well, you know, I don't think he has
much confidence\\
151 - that you'll be a success in
television.\\
152 - It's your will.\\
153 - He's been talking about that for
months.\\
154 - Well, come on, boy.
Let's get going with it.\\
155 - Get it signed because on account of
you\\
156 - I got to take it all the way back
downtown.\\
157 - Hey, wait a minute, Jerry.\\
158 - You run along.\\
159 - I'll have Lucy take it down to the
attorneys.\\
160 - Lucy? Well, now, why should she\\
161 - have to go all the way down there?\\
162 - It'll take her most of the day,\\
163 - and I won't have her in my hair
during rehearsals.\\
164 - Oh, I see.\\
165 - Is she still trying to get in the
act?\\
166 - Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.\\
167 - Ah, well, I give up.\\
168 - I tell you, I'll see you later, huh?\\
169 - All right, Jerry.\\
170 - knock 'em
dead tonight.\\
171 - Lucy, I got something...\\
172 - Lucy?\\
173 - No.\\
174 - And that's final.\\
175 - Hurry up, honey.\\
176 - Coming, master.\\
177 - Who was that at the door?\\
178 - Jerry.\\
179 - Jerry? What did he say?\\
180 - Does he know anything yet?\\
181 - What did he say?
What did he say?\\
182 - "What did he say?
What did he say?
What did he say?"\\
183 - Nothing. Just business.\\
184 - He brought my will.\\
185 - Oh. I'll get your toast for you.\\
186 - Your will?\\
187 - Yeah.\\
188 - What's the matter, Ricky?\\
189 - Nothing is the matter.\\
190 - There is, too.\\
191 - You're keeping something from me.\\
192 - You're sick.\\
193 - I never felt better in my whole life.\\
194 - Then you lied to me when we were
married.\\
195 - You're really older than I think.\\
196 - Now, look, honey, this is just good
business.\\
197 - The lawyer said I should have a will.\\
198 - Then everything is legally taken care
of\\
199 - if anything happens, that's all.\\
200 - I won't discuss it.\\
201 - Look, you have to know what to do,\\
202 - so that you know what you... going to
happen\\
203 - when, when I go.\\
204 - All right, Ricky.\\
205 - That's better.\\
206 - Now what's the matter?\\
207 - Oh, Ricky, I miss you so!\\
208 - For goodness' sakes, Lucy,\\
209 - I haven't gone yet.\\
210 - Don't go, Ricky.
Don't go!\\
211 - Now, look, honey, I'm perfectly well.\\
212 - I feel fine.\\
213 - we all have to go
sometime.\\
214 - We do?\\
215 - We do unless you know something\\
216 - the rest of us don't.\\
217 - No, I "dun't."\\
218 - I'll get your toast for you.\\
219 - All right.\\
220 - He brought your will along, too.\\
221 - My will?\\
222 - Yeah.\\
223 - What for?\\
224 - You're the one that's going.\\
225 - Now, Lucy...\\
226 - What are you trying to do,\\
227 - shove me ahead of you in line?\\
228 - Look, honey, this isn't my idea.\\
229 - It's the lawyers'.\\
230 - We got to get them signed,\\
231 - and you got to take it down to the
attorneys today.\\
232 - Impossible. I have an appointment\\
233 - to have my hair dyed. Washed.\\
234 - They got to go today.\\
235 - Aw, Ricky, the attorney's way
downtown.\\
236 - It'll take me all day.\\
237 - Yeah, I know.\\
238 - Look, Lucy, forget about the toast.\\
239 - I got to go to the club.\\
240 - Oh, Ricky, do I have to take them
down today?\\
241 - Can't they wait?\\
242 - Absolutely not.\\
243 - Why not?\\
244 - Well... well, suppose you didn't take
them down till tomorrow.\\
245 - Yes?\\
246 - And we both got killed today.\\
247 - Yes?\\
248 - How could you take them down
tomorrow?\\
249 - Oh, yeah, that's right.\\
250 - Babalu aye\\
251 - Babalu aye...\\
252 - Babalu aye\\
253 - Babalu aye...\\
254 - Yeah!\\
255 - Fellows, what's the use of having a
rehearsal\\
256 - if we're not going to do it right?\\
257 - When you sing, don't go, "Ah, ah, ah,
ah."\\
258 - Go "Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!"\\
259 - Let's put some pep into the thing,
you know?\\
260 - All right?\\
261 - Okay, all right.\\
262 - Pepito!\\
263 - Haven't you got your costume on yet?\\
264 - I'm coming!\\
265 - All right.
Start my music!\\
266 - Come on, let's go!
All right.\\
267 - Let's get "Valencia."\\
268 - Siempre elegante.\\
269 - Aydame un poquito.\\
270 - Como no, mucho gusto.\\
271 - Ah, thanks, SeÃ±or Ricardo, muchas
gracias.\\
272 - My impression of a baby cry.\\
273 - Awwww!\\
274 - The world's smallest bicycle.\\
275 - Make myself comfortable, Balley,
SeÃ±or Balley.\\
276 - No, trombonista.\\
277 - Hey, Don Carmen,\\
278 - Don Pepe, that's wonderful.\\
279 - Te gusta, eh?
Very good.\\
280 - Listen, aren't you going to do\\
281 - the big bicycle, you know, the zigzag
business?\\
282 - Oh, the zigzag?
Yeah.\\
283 - All right?\\
284 - Okay, vamos a ver.
Okay.\\
285 - Pepito!
Pepito!\\
286 - Pepito!\\
287 - Are you all right?\\
288 - Well, I'm alive.\\
289 - All you need is a little rest.\\
290 - Help him along there.\\
291 - I go home.\\
292 - No, Pepito, don't go home, would you?
That's too far.\\
293 - Why don't you go over to my
apartment?\\
294 - There's nobody there.\\
295 - You can rest for a couple of hours.\\
296 - Okay.
All right?\\
297 - My bicycle broke!\\
298 - They'll help you with it.
Will you help him?\\
299 - Sure.\\
300 - Take it easy now, Pepe, will you?\\
301 - I, I, I'll be all right.\\
302 - All right.\\
303 - You go and finish your rehearsal.\\
304 - All right, Pepe, take it easy now.\\
305 - Go with him, would you, fellows?\\
306 - Let's, uh, let's take "The
Continental."\\
307 - "The Continental," you ready?\\
308 - Okay.\\
309 - All right, all right.\\
310 - What kind of a start is that?\\
311 - All right, all right.\\
312 - Drum roll.\\
313 - It's me.
It's me, Pepito!\\
314 - Pepito!\\
315 - What are you doing here?\\
316 - I hurt myself at rehearsal.\\
317 - Ricky told me to come here and rest.\\
318 - What are you doing at rehearsal?\\
319 - Are they getting ready for that
television audition?\\
320 - It's tonight.\\
321 - Tonight!\\
322 - Why, that big bum.\\
323 - So that's why he wanted me to traipse
all the way downtown.\\
324 - Just to get rid of me.\\
325 - Well, how do you feel, Pepito, all
right?\\
326 - Uh, not so good.\\
327 - Gee, what's Ricky going to do if
you're not there?\\
328 - Who will he get?\\
329 - I don't know.\\
330 - Maybe you can take my place.\\
331 - Oh, don't be ridicu...\\
332 - Hey...\\
333 - Pepito!
Yeah?\\
334 - You look awful.
I do?\\
335 - Yeah, you're, you're hurt worse than
you think.\\
336 - I am?!
Yeah, you'd better lie down and rest.\\
337 - No, no, no, I, I, I,\\
338 - I need, I need to do it for Ricky.\\
339 - Feels pretty good.\\
340 - It does, huh?\\
341 - I think I can do it.\\
342 - You do, huh?\\
343 - Yup, yeah, I think I can do it just
fine.\\
344 - Hup! Eh!\\
345 - Still think you can make it tonight,
Pepito?\\
346 - Here, did, did, did, did Pepito show
up yet?\\
347 - No, he has not come.\\
348 - Oh, my goodness, here we are,\\
349 - we're giving the audition,\\
350 - the sponsor's out there, and, and
he's not here yet.\\
351 - What am I going to do?\\
352 - I'll tell you what I'll do.\\
353 - I'll do one more number,\\
354 - and if he doesn't show up by then,\\
355 - I, I'll just have to close the show.\\
356 - All right?
All right.\\
357 - Okay.\\
358 - Eh, we'll do "Cabbie," eh?\\
359 - Give me the hat.\\
360 - Ladies and gentlemen,\\
361 - may I have your attention for a
minute, please?\\
362 - You know, the last time that we went
to Havana,\\
363 - we met a fellow down there\\
364 - that we'd like to talk to you about\\
365 - because he's really quite a
character.\\
366 - He, uh, he drives a horse and buggy
in Havana.\\
367 - As a matter of fact,\\
368 - he drives the only horse and buggy
left in Havana.\\
369 - He, uh, he doesn't believe in taxi
cabs.\\
370 - He says a taxi cab and a Havana moon
don't go well together.\\
371 - So he's broke all the time, but he's
happy.\\
372 - Everybody knows him down there.\\
373 - They all like him,\\
374 - and they call him "The Cuban Cabbie."\\
375 - And if you want to see him,\\
376 - all you got to do is just come down
with me to Havana.\\
377 - We sit in the open air cafes in El
Prado.\\
378 - And he'll be riding up and down the
boulevard.\\
379 - Every night.\\
380 - And if you happen to be in the mood
for listening,\\
381 - you probably hear him singing
something like this.\\
382 - Giddyap there, Pinto.\\
383 - I forgot to tell you.\\
384 - "Pinto" is the name of the horse.\\
385 - My horse and carriage is for hire,
SeÃ±ora\\
386 - For just as long as you desire\\
387 - SeÃ±orita\\
388 - Do you want to ride\\
389 - Forget the maÃ±ana and come to Havana
with me\\
390 - I'm the Cuban Cabbie\\
391 - I'm the Cuban Cabbie\\
392 - The taxi drivers drive you frantic,
you know\\
393 - Oh, but my rig is more romantic and
so\\
394 - Do you want to ride?\\
395 - An eye full of splendor and you can
depend upon me\\
396 - I'm the Cuban Cabbie\\
397 - And I need dinero\\
398 - Money, that is.\\
399 - The moon is peeping, the shadows
creeping\\
400 - It's time for riding through the park\\
401 - A lovely night for lovers\\
402 - The same as you two are\\
403 - If you like music, I'll give you
music\\
404 - As we go riding in the dark\\
405 - I'll sing Spanish love songs to the
strains of my guitar\\
406 - Esa luna que tienes\\
407 - Cielito lindo, junto a la boca\\
408 - No se, no besa a nadie, cielito lindo\\
409 - I'm just kidding fellow.
Si a mi me toca\\
410 - Aye, aye, ya, aye\\
411 - Everybody, sing, sing!\\
412 - Canta y no llores\\
413 - Canta!\\
414 - Porque cantando se alegran, cielito
lindo, los corazones\\
415 - Once more, everybody!\\
416 - Aye, aye, ya, aye\\
417 - Aye, yay, yay.\\
418 - Canta y no llores\\
419 - Porque cantando se alegran, cielito
lindo, los cora...\\
420 - Ole!\\
421 - You're a fine one.\\
422 - I'm singing a love song.
She's getting hysterical.\\
423 - My horse and carriage is for hire,
SeÃ±ora\\
424 - For just as long as you desire,
SeÃ±orita\\
425 - Do you want to ride\\
426 - The sweet seÃ±oritas and gay
caballeros know me\\
427 - I'm the Cuban Cabbie\\
428 - And I know my business\\
429 - And I mind my business\\
430 - You want to ride\\
431 - You want to ride\\
432 - You want to ride\\
433 - You want to ride\\
434 - Do you want to ride?\\
435 - Thank you very much, ladies and
gentlemen.\\
436 - Thank you.\\
437 - You've been a wonderful audience,\\
438 - but I am afraid that we're going to
close...\\
439 - Have you seen a fellow
named Risky Riskerdoe?\\
440 - Have you seen a fellow named Risky
Riskerdoe?\\
441 - Have you...? Hah!\\
442 - Who are...?\\
443 - Who are you looking for?\\
444 - I'm looking for a fellow named Risky
Riskerdoe.\\

446 - Oh, well, pleased to meet you.\\
447 - Pleased to meet you.\\

Riskerdoe?\\
449 - Huh?\\

No.\\
516 - I'll tell you what, though.\\
517 - I have a brand-new instrument.
Yeah?\\
518 - And I've been looking for somebody

\subsection {Episode 01: The Girl Want To Go To The Nightclub (1951)}
1 - Here, you missed something on this
one.\\
2 - That's the design.\\
3 - It is?\\
4 - Sure, can't you see.\\
5 - Flowers against a background of...\\
6 - gravy.\\
7 - I've been meaning to talk to you
about Monday night.\\
8 - We want you and Ricky to help us
celebrate.\\
9 - It's our wedding anniversary.\\
10 - Oh, yours and Fred's?\\
11 - No, me and Gregory Peck.\\
12 - We've been married for 18 years\\
13 - and I vowed that at least once before
I died\\
14 - Fred was going to take me to a
nightclub\\
15 - on our wedding anniversary.\\
16 - Well, that sounds reasonable.\\
17 - Now this is my plan.\\
18 - We'll go in there and I'll say:\\
19 - "I know what let's do next Monday
night.\\
20 - Let's go to a nightclub."\\
21 - And you second the motion.\\
22 - Then Ricky will bound to his feet and
say\\
23 - "That's great."\\
24 - Then Fred will have to take me...\\
25 - Ricky bounds to his feet and says,
"That's great"?\\
26 - Right.\\
27 - Wrong, Ricky hates nightclubs.\\
28 - But he works in one.\\
29 - Your life should be just one gay
round of nightclubs.\\
30 - Yeah, that's what I thought when I
married a bandleader,\\
31 - but ever since we said "I do"\\
32 - there are so many things we don't.\\
33 - Well, it was a good idea while it
lasted.\\
34 - Gee, it was going to be the
Copacabana.\\
35 - The Copacabana.\\
36 - Uh-huh.\\
37 - Gee!\\
38 - Well, don't you worry, we'll go!\\
39 - We will?\\
40 - Sure, I want to go as much as you do.\\
41 - But don't forget you can catch more
flies\\
42 - with honey than you can with vinegar.\\
43 - You mean, be nice to the boys?\\
44 - Yeah, we'll be so lovey-dovey to them\\
45 - that they'll be sitting in a
nightclub\\
46 - before they know what hit them.\\
47 - Oh, that ought to do it.
Sure.\\
48 - Hey, Rick, are you doing anything
Monday night?\\
49 - I don't think so.
It's my night off, why?\\
50 - I'd like you to join me in
commemoration\\
51 - of an 18-year-old tragedy.\\
52 - What do you mean?\\
53 - Well, it's our wedding anniversary.\\
54 - Oh, you want us to join you in a
celebration?\\
55 - I prefer to think of it as a grim
reminder.\\
56 - I'd like to go over to Charlie's
steak house\\
57 - and then take in the fights.\\
58 - Oh, you dreamer, you.\\
59 - Yeah, I guess you're right.\\
60 - I don't know, Fred.\\
61 - If you want to go to the fights, I
think you should.\\
62 - After all, it's your anniversary.\\
63 - There must be some way\\
64 - we can get the girls to go to the
fights.\\
65 - Yeah, we can tie them in sacks\\
66 - and carry them in.\\
67 - I tell you what!\\
68 - As soon as they come into the living
room\\
69 - we'll be real nice to them, see\\
70 - soft-soap them a little\\
71 - smoosh 'em up.\\
72 - Smoosh?\\
73 - Ethel?\\
74 - Now, look, everybody knows you can
get around a woman\\
75 - with a little sweet talk.\\
76 - Well, that's all right for Lucy\\
77 - but it's a longer trip around Ethel.\\
78 - Do you want to go to the fights, or
don't you?\\
79 - All right, all right, I'll smooch.\\
80 - Okay, now...\\
81 - How can four people use so many
dishes?\\
82 - I don't know.\\
83 - What's the matter?\\
84 - What you standing up for?\\
85 - Because two gorgeous ladies entered
the room.\\
86 - They did, where?\\
87 - They mean us.\\
88 - Oh!\\
89 - You great big Latin lover, you!\\
90 - Oh, you sweet handsome man, you!\\
91 - You gorgeous exciting woman, you!\\
92 - I pass.\\
93 - Aw, isn't he cute?\\
94 - Darling, why don't you sit down here.\\
95 - Oh, yes, you sit down, too, baby.\\
96 - Well, you sit down on my lap.\\
97 - You'll be more comfortable there.\\
98 - All right.\\
99 - You sit there, darling.\\
100 - This chair is more comfortable.\\
101 - Oh, but if it's so comfortable\\
102 - I want you to have it.\\
103 - Ethel, do one thing that I ask, will
you, please?\\
104 - I said sit down!\\
105 - Ethel, don't you think you're
overdoing it a little?\\
106 - How about a cigarette?\\
107 - I'll get them.\\
108 - No, don't trouble yourself.\\
109 - Oh!
Oh, sorry.\\
110 - Thank you very much.\\
111 - That's all right.\\
112 - Thank you, Lucy.\\
113 - Thank you very much.\\
114 - It's all right.\\
115 - Light, light?\\
116 - You know, Ricky, baby,\\
117 - there's only one time you look
handsomer than you do now\\
118 - and that's when you wear a tuxedo.\\
119 - Oh, yes, I think a tuxedo\\
120 - is the best- looking thing\\
121 - a man can wear.\\
122 - Unless he's wearing boxing trunks.\\
123 - Speaking of boxing\\
124 - there's nothing more exciting\\
125 - than a ringside seat.\\
126 - Yes, sir, a ringside seat at the
Copacabana.\\
127 - Yeah. Well, look, Lucy, Monday is
Fred's anniversary\\
128 - and he wants to go to the fights.\\
129 - Yeah, well, Monday's Ethel's
anniversary, too,\\
130 - and she wants to go to a nightclub.\\
131 - Yeah, well, Fred is not going to go\\
132 - to any stuffy nightclub.\\
133 - Well, Ethel's not going to any stale
fights.\\
134 - Lucy, don't push me too far.\\
135 - It's the fights or nothing.\\
136 - Well, is that final?\\
137 - Final.\\
138 - Then you brought this on yourself.\\
139 - Ethel wants a divorce.\\
140 - Good.\\
141 - No, she doesn't!\\
142 - No, I don't!\\
143 - Well, honey, you said you wanted to
go...\\
144 - Why don't you mind your own business?\\
145 - Wait a minute, will you!\\
146 - Everybody be calm!\\
147 - We'll figure out a way to settle this
thing.\\
148 - I know, the democratic way!\\
149 - We'll put it to a vote.\\
150 - Couldn't you guess how it's going to
come out?\\
151 - We'll try it anyhow.\\
152 - All right, everybody wants to go to
the fights\\
153 - raise their hand.\\
154 - One, two.\\
155 - Everybody wants to go to the
nightclub\\
156 - raise their hands.\\
157 - One, two, three.\\
158 - All right, I guess we'll have to go\\
159 - to the Copaca...\\
160 - Three?\\
161 - Lucy!\\
162 - Well, I don't care.
We want to go to the Copacabana.\\
163 - We're going to the fights.\\
164 - If you go to the fights, you can just
go alone.\\
165 - Okay, if that's the way you want it\\
166 - and I hope you have\\
167 - a nice, pleasant evening at home.\\
168 - Who's staying at home?\\
169 - Ethel and I are going dancing at the
Copa.\\
170 - I hope one of you knows how to lead.\\
171 - We will not be dancing together,
smarty.\\
172 - We will have dates.\\
173 - We will?\\
174 - Oh, we will, we will!\\
175 - Date, Ethel with a date?\\
176 - Dates!\\
177 - That's very funny!\\
178 - Go ahead and laugh.\\
179 - I know just who our dates will be,\\
180 - and they're both tall, dark and
handsome and young.\\
181 - Who are they?\\
182 - You'll just die when I tell you.\\
183 - Two of the most eligible young
bachelors in town.\\
184 - Of course I can't talk while certain
parties are in the room.\\
185 - Well, whisper their names to me.\\
186 - Okay.\\
187 - No!\\
188 - Yes!\\
189 - I guess we can take a hint.\\
190 - Come on downstairs to my apartment,
Rick.\\
191 - I don't like the atmosphere up here.\\
192 - Yeah.\\
193 - Lucy, what were those names you
whispered to me?\\
194 - What did they sound like?\\
195 - It sounded like Little Boy Blue and
Peter Cottontail.\\
196 - That's who it was.\\
197 - Huh?\\
198 - Well, I was just trying to put up a
big front\\
199 - while the boys were here.\\
200 - That's what I was afraid of.\\
201 - Where can we get any dates?\\
202 - Don't give up so easily.\\
203 - We'll find some men somewhere.\\
204 - Where?\\
205 - There's no place where millions of
single women\\
206 - haven't already looked.\\
207 - Well, how about...\\
208 - No.\\
209 - Uh...\\
210 - No.\\
211 - Oh, we're not concentrating.\\
212 - We must know two men who are single
and attractive.\\
213 - Two men who are single?\\
214 - Two men?\\
215 - A boy and a dog?\\
216 - No, maybe we should settle\\
217 - for Little Boy Blue and Peter
Cottontail.\\
218 - I know.
What?\\
219 - I'll get my address book,\\
220 - call up some of my old boyfriends.\\
221 - Oh, Lucy.\\
222 - It's only 11 years old.\\
223 - Oh!\\
224 - Well, after all, it's worth a try.\\
225 - This is an emergency.\\
226 - I'll start at the A's.\\
227 - George Anderson.\\
228 - Hmm, Butterfield 89970.\\
229 - Brother, will Monday be a night!\\
230 - We'll go over to Charlie's\\
231 - and we'll get steaks this thick\\
232 - and we'll have big slices\\
233 - of raw onions all over 'em.\\
234 - And there won't be any women around\\
235 - to tell us we can't eat them.\\
236 - Do you suppose they really can get
dates?\\
237 - Well, who cares.\\
238 - Why don't you stop worrying about
them.\\
239 - I keep thinking\\
240 - that they'll go out to dinner
somewhere\\
241 - and they'll have some champagne\\
242 - then they'll go to the Copacabana\\
243 - and have more champagne\\
244 - and then they'll dance and have more
champagne\\
245 - and who knows what will happen.\\
246 - Yeah, with all that champagne even
Ethel might look good.\\
247 - Well, what are we going to do, Rick?\\
248 - Well, we could get dates, too\\
249 - and go to the Copacabana and keep an
eye on them.\\
250 - No, that's not a very good idea.\\
251 - Dates!\\
252 - You said dates.\\
253 - Ricky, that's the most sensational
idea\\
254 - you ever had!\\
255 - And we owe it to ourselves.\\
256 - We can get a couple of blondes\\
257 - just to help us keep our eye\\
258 - on our wives who've seen fit\\
259 - to go out with other men!\\
260 - Yeah.\\
261 - And they couldn't get mad at us\\
262 - by being with other girls\\
263 - because they're there with other
fellows.\\
264 - What a dream situation.\\
265 - And I bet you know a million gals.\\
266 - Where's your address book?\\
267 - I burned it.\\
268 - Burned it!\\
269 - I hadn't been in this country very
long\\
270 - and Lucy said it was part of\\
271 - the American marriage ceremony.\\
272 - That's absolutely criminal.\\
273 - I bet you could have got a fortune
for that book.\\
274 - "A" alone was worth a hundred bucks.\\
275 - Hey, I'll tell you what I'll do.\\
276 - I'll call Ginny Jones.\\
277 - You mean the girl that sings at the
Starlight Roof?\\
278 - Yeah.\\
279 - She's married now, but she knows
every girl in town.\\
280 - I'm glad you thought of her.\\
281 - Yes, well, it's been nice talking to
you, Paul.\\
282 - Yes, it's been a long time.\\
283 - My, my, seven children.\\
284 - Yes, it's been a long time.\\
285 - Yes, well, all right, good-bye, Paul.\\
286 - Well, that takes care of old Wagner.\\
287 - Yeah, Excelsior Cleaners, Yum Yum
Market\\
288 - and Sam Zabaglione.\\
289 - Sam Zabaglione, he must be around.\\
290 - Nobody would marry him.\\
291 - Plaza 52099.\\
292 - Did you call up Howard Thompson?\\
293 - He isn't marked off.\\
294 - Yeah, he's busy Monday night.\\
295 - Baby-sitting with his grandson.\\
296 - Oh, yeah.\\
297 - Grandson!\\
298 - Well, don't look at me like that!\\
299 - When I dated him\\
300 - he was an interesting older man.\\
301 - Hello, hello, is this Sam
Zabaglione's house?\\
302 - Oh, no, no, no, don't call your daddy
to the phone.\\
303 - I don't want to talk...\\
304 - Little girl, paisan!\\
305 - Well, we can always call the zoo\\
306 - and order a couple of dancing bears.\\
307 - Oh! Why didn't I think of this
before.\\
308 - Who are you calling?\\
309 - Who, who, who?\\
310 - Quiet, you sound like an owl.\\
311 - Well, who are you calling?\\
312 - Ginny Jones, she works at the
Starlight Roof\\
313 - and she knows every man in town.\\
314 - Oh, I feel hopeful again.\\
315 - Hello, Ginny, Ginny, this is Lucy
Ricardo.\\
316 - Well, it's very nice\\
317 - to hear your voice again, too, dear.\\
318 - I'll tell you why I called.\\
319 - It seems that a friend of mine, Ethel
Mertz...\\
320 - What?\\
321 - They did!\\
322 - Ricky and Fred just called her.\\
323 - They did!\\
324 - They didn't.\\
325 - They didn't!\\
326 - They did!\\
327 - They did!\\
328 - They didn't!\\
329 - Well, did they or didn't they?\\
330 - Ricky and Fred just asked her\\
331 - to get them dates for Monday night,
too.\\
332 - They didn't!\\
333 - They did!\\
334 - Those dirty two-timers.\\
335 - Wait till I get my hands on...\\
336 - Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, I got an idea.\\
337 - Ginny, I want you to get them dates\\
338 - for Monday night.\\
339 - That's right.\\
340 - But the dates will be Ethel and me.\\
341 - Yeah, and one more thing, Ginny\\
342 - I want you to build up these
beautiful, blind dates\\
343 - yeah, and tell them that we'll meet
them\\
344 - at Ricky's apartment at 8:00.\\
345 - That's right.\\
346 - Just leave the rest to us, Ginny.\\
347 - Okay, bye.\\
348 - I wonder what they'll be like.\\
349 - Ginny said that they were just
knockouts.\\
350 - Real dreams.\\
351 - Gorgeous willowy figures.\\
352 - Sweet dispositions.\\
353 - I wonder why they wanted\\
354 - to meet us here at the apartment.\\
355 - Well, maybe they want to be with us
alone.\\
356 - Well, why...?
Now, now, don't fight it.\\
357 - Just be thankful our wives have got
early dinner dates.\\
358 - Hello, there!\\
359 - H-H... How do you, how do you do?\\
360 - We're be looking for a couple\\
361 - of fellers named Ricky and Fred.\\
362 - Be you they?\\
363 - We be...

364 - Good-bye.\\
365 - Oh, boy, that's a good one.\\
366 - We be your dates.\\
367 - This one is yours, Fred.\\
368 - Oh, no, no, no.\\
369 - This one is yours, too, Fred.\\
370 - Wait a minute, now\\

372 - I'm going to have that little man

374 - Oh, no.\\
375 - Hey, I'm going to like you.\\

Come on.\\
485 - Oh, there you are, Ricky boy.\\
486 - I've been waiting to pitch a little
woo\\
487 - with you hog-center style.\\
488 - Okay, only I thought we'd do it Latin
style.\\
489 - Latin style?\\
490 - Yeah.\\
491 - Hey... hey, now, take it easy!\\
492 - Now wait just a...\\
493 - Hey, just a minute!\\
494 - Come here.\\
495 - Ma!\\
496 - I'm getting out of here.\\
497 - I'm coming with you!\\
498 - This smart aleck's trying to unbutton\\
499 - my high-top shoes.\\
500 - Call us again, Lucy.\\
501 - Nice to have met you, Ethel.\\
502 - Why, Fred Mertz!\\
503 - You knew it all the time!\\
504 - Well, not all the time.\\
505 - You were pretty convincing.\\
506 - Wait a minute, what are we laughing
at?\\
507 - You two bums were going out with
other women.\\
508 - Yeah!
Now, now, now, listen, listen.\\
509 - I swear we were only getting dates\\
510 - to go to the Copa just to keep an eye
on you girls.\\
511 - Is that the truth?\\
512 - Upon my honor, passion flower.\\
513 - What do you think?\\
514 - Now, look, just to convince you that
we're on the level,\\
515 - you two girls go and change your
clothes\\
516 - and we'll all go out\\
517 - and celebrate the Mertz's
anniversary.\\
518 - Right!
Oh, Ricky!\\
519 - Happy anniversary, Ethel.\\
520 - Thank you, Lucy.
 
\subsection {Episode 02: Be A Pal (1951)}
1 - More coffee, dear?\\
2 - Ricky, you want some more coffee?\\
3 - Are your eggs all right, dear?\\
4 - Are your eggs...\\
5 - "How are your eggs, Lucy?"\\
6 - "Oh, they're just fine, thank you."\\
7 - "Would you care for some more
coffee?"\\
8 - "Oh, no, thanks.\\
9 - It's just right, thank you."\\
10 - "You're a wonderful cook."\\
11 - "Oh! Do you really think so?\\
12 - Oh, thank you."\\
13 - "Would you care for sugar in your
coffee?"\\
14 - "Oh, well, thank you, don't mind if I
do."\\
15 - You are back there, aren't you?\\
16 - Answer it, dear.\\
17 - Good morning, is the lady of the
house in?\\
18 - Luce...!\\
19 - What are you doing out there?\\
20 - The least you could do is stay here\\
21 - and have breakfast with your husband\\
22 - in the morning.\\
23 - Oh, I only got ten minutes to get to
rehearsal.\\
24 - Bye, honey.
I'll see you for dinner.\\
25 - Morning, Lucy.\\
26 - Hello!\\
27 - How are things?\\
28 - Just fine.\\
29 - What's the matter, aren't you hungry?\\
30 - Somebody's disposition\\
31 - got up on the wrong side of the bed
this morning.\\
32 - Did you and Ricky have words?\\
33 - We had words all right, but they were
all mine.\\
34 - I'm sick and tired of eating
breakfast\\
35 - opposite a newspaper.\\
36 - Does Ricky hide behind his newspaper
in the morning?\\
37 - He certainly does!\\
38 - Does he ignore you\\
39 - and refuse to answer questions?\\
40 - Exactly.\\
41 - Well, this is a case for Dr.
Humphries.\\
42 - Dr. Who-phries?\\
43 - Dr. Humphries-- he just wrote a book\\
44 - called How to Keep the Honeymoon From
Ending.\\
45 - Is that a "Book of the Week"
selection?\\
46 - Uh-huh.
We have that book.\\
47 - Well, you should read it.\\
48 - Why? What could Dr. Humphries
possibly know about Ricky?\\
49 - I'll show you.\\
50 - Where's the book?\\
51 - Over there on the desk, I guess.\\
52 - Well, now... let's see.\\
53 - When Love is on
the Wane.\\
54 - "Often after the first years of
marriage,\\
55 - "the husband seems to lose interest
in the wife.\\
56 - "He reads the paper at the breakfast
table.\\
57 - "He doesn't answer when you talk to
him.\\
58 - "In short, he doesn't seem\\
59 - to know you are alive."\\
60 - I wonder where Dr. Humphries ever met
Ricky.\\
61 - "More than likely,\\
62 - this unfortunate condition is the
fault of the wife."\\
63 - What?!\\
64 - That's a lot of nonsense.\\
65 - "Contrary to what some wives may
think,\\
66 - this is not a lot of nonsense."\\
67 - Well.\\
68 - "Research shows that this condition
starts\\
69 - "when the wife becomes careless\\
70 - "about her appearance.\\
71 - "Let her ask herself these questions:\\
72 - "Does she come to breakfast\\
73 - with her hair in curlers?"\\
74 - "Is she sloppy in her attire?"\\
75 - "Does she forget to make up her
face?"\\
76 - "Is the answer to these questions
'Yes'?\\
77 - "Then it is time\\
78 - for the wife to do something about
it."\\
79 - What?\\
80 - "Dress up for your husband at
breakfast.\\
81 - "Be glamorous and sophisticated.\\
82 - "Make yourself so attractive,\\
83 - "he not only will pay attention to
you during breakfast,\\
84 - he won't even want to leave for the
office."\\
85 - I'll do it.\\
86 - Tomorrow morning, I'll be simply
dazzling.\\
87 - Good morning, Ricky darling.\\
88 - More coffee, Ricky darling?\\
89 - Sugar, dear?\\
90 - Cream?\\
91 - Jam on your toast, sweetheart?\\
92 - I want a divorce.\\
93 - That's nice, dear.\\
94 - Fuego! Fuego! Fuego!\\
95 - Lucy, get out!\\
96 - Fire! Fire!\\
97 - What's the matter with you?\\
98 - You crazy or something?\\
99 - Look at me.\\
100 - Well?\\
101 - Well?\\
102 - You don't look so good.\\
103 - Let me see your tongue.\\
104 - Say "Ah."\\
105 - Ah.\\
106 - I think you better go and see a
doctor.\\
107 - There's nothing the matter with me.\\
108 - Are you sure?\\
109 - Yes, I'm sure.\\
110 - Well, thank goodness.\\
111 - Good-bye, sweetheart.
Got to go.\\
112 - But Ricky...\\
113 - Oh, Ethel and that stale book of
hers.\\
114 - Hello.\\
115 - Hello, Ethel, what you doing?\\
116 - I'm eating a donut.\\
117 - Well, come on up here and have coffee
with me, will you?\\
118 - What are you talking about?\\
119 - I can't understand you; will you talk
into the phone?\\
120 - What?\\
121 - Oh, hi, Ethel, I'll be with you in a
minute.\\
122 - I got to hang up now, Ethel, Ethel's
here.\\
123 - I've been here all along.\\
124 - Oh.\\
125 - Gee, you look great.\\
126 - Thank you.\\
127 - Well, is everything okey-dokey?\\
128 - No, everything is inky-stinky.\\
129 - What happened?\\
130 - Nothing! He didn't even notice me.\\
131 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
132 - I can't imagine why it didn't work.\\
133 - Well, let's see what Dr. Humphries
has to say.\\
134 - Oh, forget that tired Dr. Humphries.\\
135 - "Be glamorous in the morning.\\
136 - "Be sophisticated.\\
137 - This method cannot fail."\\
138 - Ha! Ha!\\
139 - Now, just a minute.\\
140 - Let's look at chapter two.\\
141 - "If the method in chapter one
fails--"\\
142 - And it did.\\
143 - "If the method in chapter one fails,\\
144 - you should next try the 'Be a Pal'
system."\\
145 - "'Be a Pal' system"?\\
146 - "Share your husband's interests.\\
147 - "Join in his hobbies.\\
148 - "If he hunts, take up hunting.\\
149 - "If he fishes, take up fishing.\\
150 - If he golfs, take up golfing."\\
151 - Ricky plays poker-- I'll have to take
up poking.\\
152 - Hey, Ricky's playing tonight, isn't
he?\\
153 - Yeah, with Fred and the boys\\
154 - down in our apartment.\\
155 - I'm joining that game.\\
156 - Attagirl.\\
157 - Oh, wait a minute.\\
158 - I don't know how to play poker.\\
159 - So what? I can teach you in a couple
of hours.\\
160 - Okay, how do we start?\\
161 - Well, it's a lot like hearts,\\
162 - only you bet\\
163 - and there isn't any old maid.\\
164 - Aces and tens.\\
165 - Hold it, Curly.\\
166 - Three ladies.\\
167 - Your deal, Charlie.\\
168 - Hiya, fellas.\\
169 - Hiya, Charlie.
Hiya, Hank.\\
170 - Hello.\\
171 - Lucy, what's going on?\\
172 - Well, thought I'd join the game, if
you guys don't mind.\\
173 - Well...\\
174 - What goes?\\
175 - Look, honey, we'd love to play with
you,\\
176 - but you don't know how to play poker.\\
177 - Oh, yes, I do.\\
178 - Ethel taught me this afternoon.\\
179 - Oh, no!\\
180 - Honey, please, now, we're trying...\\
181 - I'll just sit right in here.\\
182 - Could you move over a bit, Hank?\\
183 - Thanks a lot.
Thank you.\\
184 - You mind, Hank?\\
185 - Not really.\\
186 - You fellas?\\
187 - I guess not.\\
188 - Well, go on.\\
189 - Deal the cards, Charlie.
Deal 'em!\\
190 - I don't have any of those little
round things.\\
191 - Here, I'll finance you.\\
192 - Oh, is this money?\\
193 - Ooh!\\
194 - Ooh! A queen.\\
195 - There's her sister.\\
196 - Honey, you're supposed\\
197 - to keep your cards a secret.\\
198 - Oh.\\
199 - Ooh!\\
200 - What'd you get, Fred?
What'd you get?\\
201 - Well, I shouldn't talk,\\
202 - but you can tell your two Andrews
Sisters\\
203 - not to wait up for Laverne.\\
204 - I'll open for two.\\
205 - I'm in.\\
206 - Honey, if you want to stay in the
pot,\\
207 - you've got to put in two chips.\\
208 - Oh, oh.\\
209 - Cards?\\
210 - Two.\\
211 - Two.\\
212 - Three for me, please.\\
213 - Three.\\
214 - How many cards you want, Lucy?\\
215 - Oh, do I get more?\\
216 - Honey, you've got\\
217 - to get rid of your worst cards\\
218 - in order to get new ones.\\
219 - Oh, my!
This is a problem.\\
220 - Honey, please, you're holding up the
game.\\
221 - Well, I can't decide\\
222 - whether to throw away my two queens\\
223 - or my three kings.\\
224 - What are you doing that for?\\
225 - 'Cause as much as we hate to admit
it, you won.\\
226 - I did?\\
227 - Hey, this is fun.\\
228 - You deal, Hank.\\
229 - I think I'll deal this one, fellas.\\
230 - Lucy, it's his...\\
231 - I'll fix it.\\
232 - You got your five?
Yeah.\\
233 - I got my five.\\
234 - Everybody got their cards?\\
235 - Thank you.\\
236 - There.\\
237 - I open for two.\\
238 - I'm in.\\
239 - I'll stay.\\
240 - Oh, excuse me.\\
241 - I'm in.\\
242 - Oh.\\
243 - Cards, honey.
Cards, please.\\
244 - Oh.\\
245 - No, the other way around, dear.\\
246 - I'm fine.\\
247 - You look tired.\\
248 - Two.\\
249 - Two.\\
250 - Three for me, please.\\
251 - I'll take four.\\
252 - I bet three.\\
253 - I'm out.\\
254 - Me, too.\\
255 - I'm folding.\\
256 - How about you, Peeping Tom?\\
257 - Well, I'll bet five.\\
258 - Oh, you're raising me?\\
259 - I am?\\
260 - There's your raise, and I'll raise
you two.\\
261 - Well, there's your raise, and I'll
raise you three.\\
262 - There's your raise, and I'll raise
you four.\\
263 - Well, there's your raise, and I'll
raise you...\\
264 - Ricky?\\
265 - What?\\
266 - Run over it for me, will you?\\
267 - Run over what?\\
268 - You know, what beats what.\\
269 - Two pairs beat a pair.\\
270 - Go on.\\
271 - Three of a kind beats two pair.\\
272 - Go on.\\
273 - A straight beats three of a
kind.\\
274 - Go on.\\
275 - A flush beats a straight.\\
276 - Go on.\\
277 - A full house beats a flush.\\
278 - Go on.\\
279 - Four of a kind beats a full house.\\
280 - That's the one!\\
281 - They're all yours.\\
282 - Whee!\\
283 - Oh, boy.\\
284 - Honey, just out of curiosity\\
285 - what were your four of a kind?\\
286 - I didn't have four of a kind,\\
287 - I had a pair.\\
288 - Sure... see?
Two nines.\\
289 - Lucy?\\
290 - Yeah.\\
291 - This one is a nine...\\
292 - Uh-huh.\\
293 - And this one is a six.\\
294 - Oh, what do you know about that.\\
295 - I didn't even have a pair.\\
296 - Isn't that funny?\\
297 - Gee, this is fun.\\
298 - Let's play a wild game.\\
299 - Everything wild but the old maid.\\
300 - Oh, forget that book, will you?\\
301 - As far as I'm concerned,\\
302 - Dr. Humphries can go jump-phrey.\\
303 - This morning, Ricky didn't even speak
to me.\\
304 - He hasn't been speaking to you in the
morning for weeks.\\
305 - Well, it was the way he didn't speak
to me.\\
306 - And Dr. Humphries knows why.\\
307 - One thing to remember\\
308 - "about the 'Be a Pal' system in
chapter two,\\
309 - "if you play games with your husband\\
310 - be sure not to beat him."\\
311 - Now he tells me.\\
312 - "If methods one and two have failed,\\
313 - "there is one last desperate measure.\\
314 - I suggest that the wife become a
mother."\\
315 - I suggest he mind his own business.\\
316 - Now, let me finish.\\
317 - "Most men marry a woman\\
318 - "that reminds them of their mother.\\
319 - "This is because most men\\
320 - "have happy memories\\
321 - "of their carefree childhood.\\
322 - So mother your husband; baby him."\\
323 - Treat Ricky like a baby?\\
324 - "And surround him with things\\
325 - that will remind him of his boyhood."\\
326 - I don't think I know\\
327 - how to fold one of these things.\\
328 - He doesn't mean that.\\
329 - Oh.\\
330 - You know, I wouldn't be surprised\\
331 - if your whole trouble is that Ricky
misses Cuba.\\
332 - Oh, Ethel, that's ridiculous.\\
333 - No, it isn't.\\
334 - You should fix this place up\\
335 - to remind him\\
336 - of his happy childhood in Cuba.\\
337 - What do you want me to do,\\
338 - plant a banana tree in the kitchen?\\
339 - You'll have to be more drastic than
that.\\
340 - This time, you really got to shock
him.\\
341 - You're right.\\
342 - This time, he'll notice me\\
343 - or I'll know the reason why.\\
344 - Now, what can we do?\\
345 - Well, what do you know about his
childhood?\\
346 - Well, not very much.\\
347 - He had five brothers, and his mother\\
348 - was a great singer and dancer.\\
349 - Perfect!\\
350 - What do you mean, perfect?\\
351 - I couldn't remind him of his mother.\\
352 - As a dancer, I got two left feet,\\
353 - and as a singer, I sound like a bull
moose\\
354 - pulling his foot out of the mud.\\
355 - So what? You've got a record player,
haven't you?\\
356 - Yeah.\\
357 - Well, we'll buy a record\\
358 - and I'll play it here in the kitchen\\
359 - while you pretend to...\\
360 - While I pretend to...\\
361 - That's it.\\
362 - Aha!\\
363 - Hey, amigo...\\
364 - SeÃ±or?\\
365 - Clem?\\
366 - Â¿Que paso?\\
367 - Oh, I beg your pardon.\\
368 - I must be in the wrong apartment.\\
369 - Oh, no, seÃ±or.\\
370 - This is it, your apartment.\\
371 - Your mama, he will be here in a
momento.\\
372 - OlÃ©!\\
373 - How are you, my little cucaracha?\\
374 - How you like the hacienda, eh?\\
375 - Lucy, have you gone off your rocker?\\
376 - Pedro, Pablo, Chucho, Jojosisi,
Jose-- la, la!\\
377 - Your brother is home.\\
378 - Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute!\\
379 - Lucy, what's going on?\\
380 - We have big fiesta--\\
381 - frijoles, taco, enchilada, tamale,
huevos ranchitas,\\
382 - guacamole and wacko taco.\\
383 - Big fiesta!\\
384 - Yay!\\
385 - Big fiesta!\\
386 - Lucy, please, would you mind telling
me what's going on?\\
387 - We make everything nice\\
388 - like when you little boy in Cuba.\\
389 - You like?\\
390 - No, I don't.\\
391 - Oh, you don't?\\
392 - Now, look, would you please explain
to me\\
393 - what is the idea of all this?\\
394 - Well, I thought you were getting
tired of me\\
395 - and if our home reminded you of Cuba\\
396 - you might like me better.\\
397 - Oh, honey.\\
398 - Oh, Lucy darling.\\
399 - If I wanted things Cuban,\\
400 - I'd have stayed in Havana.\\
401 - That's the reason I married you,\\
402 - because you're so different\\
403 - from anyone I've known in Cuba.\\
404 - Who did you know in Cuba?\\
405 - Come here.
\subsection {Episode 03: The Diet (1951)}
1 - Oh, boy, I ate too much.\\
2 - Me, too.\\
3 - I can hardly move.\\
4 - They make quite a picture, don't
they, Lucy?\\
5 - Yeah-- Porky and Fatso taking it
easy.\\
6 - Please, now, please.
No nagging on a full stomach.\\
7 - Besides, it's your own fault.\\
8 - You put too much food on the table.\\
9 - You didn't have to eat everything in
sight.\\
10 - I only ate 12 oysters.\\
11 - 16, But who counts?\\
12 - Fred, did you really eat 16 oysters?\\
13 - You heard what the oyster counter
said.\\
14 - But I was doing it for you.\\
15 - I was trying to find you a pearl.\\
16 - Well, don't pick on him.\\
17 - Ricky ate more oysters than all of us
put together.\\
18 - Naturally.\\
19 - What do you mean, naturally?\\
20 - Because I got more Rs in my name than
anyone else.\\
21 - Anyhow, the way you gals were
shoveling in that food\\
22 - I thought you were using a conveyor
belt.\\
23 - Can't help it, eating's my hobby.\\
24 - Yeah, you ought to watch that, Ethel.\\
25 - Course, it doesn't matter what I eat\\
26 - because it doesn't go to fat.\\
27 - Where does it go to, thin?\\
28 - For your information, loverboy,\\
29 - I weigh exactly the same\\
30 - as I did when we were married.\\
31 - Ha!\\
32 - Well, I do.\\
33 - Oh, come now, Lucy.\\
34 - Ethel and Fred and I have all
admitted\\
35 - that we're getting a little fat.\\
36 - A little puffy, perhaps.\\
37 - Now, why don't you break down and
admit it, too?\\
38 - Well, I'd be very happy to join your
tubby little trio\\
39 - if it were true, but it isn't.\\
40 - Oh, Lucy, you're among friends.\\
41 - Let's be honest.\\
42 - I am honest!\\
43 - When Ricky and I were married, I
weighed 110,\\
44 - and I weigh exactly that right now.\\
45 - We shall see.\\
46 - Now, don't bother getting those
bathroom scales--\\
47 - they're broken.\\
48 - I fixed them this morning.\\
49 - Oh.\\
50 - Anyway, I'm getting a little bored
with this discussion.\\
51 - Aren't you?\\
52 - No.\\
53 - Oh, whose side are you on anyway?\\
54 - I'm on the side of Ricky and his
puffy pal.\\
55 - Okay, on the scales, champ.\\
56 - This I got to see.\\
57 - Come on, on the scales.
No!\\
58 - You're the one...
Come on, on the scales.\\
59 - Oh, now, Ricky.\\
60 - On the scales.\\
61 - All right.\\
62 - How much do I weigh?\\
63 - 45 pounds, and stop leaning on us.\\
64 - Okay.\\
65 - 132?!\\
66 - On behalf of our tubby trio\\
67 - I welcome you to our flabby foursome.\\
68 - Well, now that that's over with.\\
69 - What are we going to do tonight?\\
70 - I don't know what you're going to do\\
71 - but I'm going out and kill myself.\\
72 - Honey, so you gained a little weight.\\
73 - Is that so terrible?\\
74 - A little weight?\\
75 - I walked into this room weighing 110.\\
76 - I now weigh 132.\\
77 - That's 22 pounds in ten minutes.\\
78 - Aw, Lucy, don't cry about it.\\
79 - What if I cried every time I gained a
pound?\\
80 - We'd be up to our ears in tears.\\
81 - Never mind, Fred.\\
82 - I'm nothing but a big, bloated bunch
of blubber.\\
83 - Oh, honey, now don't talk that way.\\
84 - I wouldn't want you any different\\
85 - than you are just now.\\
86 - You wouldn't?\\
87 - No... I like you plump.\\
88 - I... I didn't mean it like that.\\
89 - I mean, you look swell!\\
90 - I'm not worried about you,\\
91 - but how am I going to look on the
stage?\\
92 - The stage?\\
93 - Yes.\\
94 - Oh, no, you're not going to start
that again, are you?\\
95 - Oh, I know.\\
96 - You don't want me in show business,\\
97 - but someday, in spite of you,
opportunity will knock\\
98 - and what'll happen?\\
99 - I'll be so big and fat\\
100 - I won't be able to get up and open
the door.\\
101 - Oh, honey, forget it.\\
102 - You look wonderful.\\
103 - Hello?\\
104 - Hi, Jerry.\\
105 - What?\\
106 - Oh, this is a fine time.\\
107 - What am I supposed to do-- dance by
myself?\\
108 - Okay, okay.\\
109 - Well, look, try to get some girls
lined up\\
110 - and we'll have auditions in the
morning.\\
111 - Good-bye.\\
112 - Oh, hello, Jerry?
Hello...\\
113 - Listen, Jerry, what was the size\\
114 - of the new costume you just bought
for Joanne?\\
115 - Well, get girls that size.\\
116 - Good-bye.\\
117 - What's the matter, Ricky?\\
118 - Joanne is quitting.\\
119 - Who's Joanne?\\
120 - Oh, that's terrible.\\
121 - Who's Joanne?\\
122 - At a time like this, too.\\
123 - Who's Joanne?\\
124 - Why did she quit?\\
125 - Who's Joanne?\\
126 - She's getting married.\\
127 - Who's Joanne?\\
128 - She's the girl that dances with
Ricky.\\
129 - Now, what was I doing wrong?\\
130 - Now I got to find a girl who can sing
and dance\\
131 - and teach her the number by Saturday
night.\\
132 - I can't think of a soul.\\
133 - Lucy, will you stop that racket and
let me think?\\
134 - What are you so fidgety about?\\
135 - Your girdle too tight?\\
136 - No, I was just about to suggest that
in this very room\\
137 - there's a very pretty and talented
young lady\\
138 - who is a wonderful singer and dancer.\\
139 - Who? Ethel?\\
140 - Who? Ethel?\\
141 - No, not her-- me.\\
142 - Oh.\\
143 - Oh, Ricky, this is a wonderful chance
for me.\\
144 - I know the number.\\
145 - I can take Joanne's place. Please?\\
146 - No, that's out of the question.\\
147 - Give me one good reason.\\
148 - Well, you're...
You're too fat.\\
149 - Fat?!
You said so yourself.\\
150 - Plump maybe, but not fat.\\
151 - Come on, Fred, we'd better go.\\
152 - No, let's stay and see the fun.\\
153 - Then you won't have to hang out\\
154 - the bathroom window\\
155 - to hear what they're saying.\\
156 - Come on.\\
157 - No, now you two stay right there.\\
158 - I want you for witnesses.\\
159 - Ricky Ricardo, I'm asking you\\
160 - to give me the same chance you would
give anyone else.\\
161 - Let me come down and audition for you\\
162 - just as if I were a stranger.\\
163 - You can forget you ever knew me.\\
164 - That's a very tempting offer.\\
165 - Oh, can I audition for you, Ricky?
Can I?\\
166 - All right, all right.\\
167 - You can come down and audition in the
morning.\\
168 - Good! Fred and Ethel, now, you heard
that.
You're witnesses.\\
169 - But it's gonna be strictly business.\\
170 - I never saw you before in my life.\\
171 - Okay, Lucy?\\
172 - Lucy?\\
173 - I beg your pardon.\\
174 - Have we been introduced?\\
175 - Pardon me, but is this\\
176 - where Ricky Ricardo is auditioning
girls\\
177 - for the dance?\\
178 - Yeah, honey, but if I had known\\
179 - he wanted older women,\\
180 - I'd have brought my mother.\\
181 - Don't pay any attention to her,
honey.\\
182 - I guess we're all auditioning\\
183 - for the same part, huh?\\
184 - Can I give you a tip?\\
185 - Oh, yes.\\
186 - I've known Ricky Ricardo for a long
time.\\
187 - Oh?\\
188 - You're not his type.\\
189 - Hi, Marco.\\
190 - Hi, girls.
Sorry to keep you waiting.\\
191 - Good morning, Mr. Ricardo.\\
192 - Good morning, Mr. Ricardo.\\
193 - Now, let's all line up here, please.\\
194 - Let's all line up.\\
195 - We might as well get started.\\
196 - Let's see what you can...\\
197 - See what you can do.\\
198 - We'll, uh...
we'll start with a time step.\\
199 - All right, Marco, go ahead.\\
200 - That's fine, that's fine.\\
201 - That's enough for now.
That's enough for now.\\
202 - That's fine.\\
203 - All right, girls.
That's fine.\\
204 - Now, um..., you're all size 12,
aren't you?\\
205 - Yes.\\
206 - Uh... yeah.\\
207 - Well, that's good\\
208 - because whoever gets the job has to
wear this size-12 costume.\\
209 - Now, uh... miss...\\
210 - Uh...?\\
211 - MacGillicuddy.\\
212 - MacGillicuddy.\\
213 - Over here, please.\\
214 - Yes, sir.\\
215 - Now, take this costume into the
dressing room and put it on,\\
216 - and then we'll see what you can do
with the number.\\
217 - Yes, sir, thank you.\\
218 - All right.\\
219 - Miss Macgoullucuddy, uh...\\
220 - how are you coming along?\\
221 - Oh, I've almost got
the costume on.\\
222 - Well, hurry up.\\
223 - We're waiting.\\
224 - I'll be right there.\\
225 - All I have to do is fasten it.\\
226 - We're waiting.\\
227 - Just this one last...\\
228 - Oh!\\
229 - What happened?\\
230 - It was a very small size 12.\\
231 - Mira lo que lo hizo al vestido.\\
232 - Mira lo que le paso el vestido.\\
233 - Me dijo que tenia un size 12\\
234 - y se lo puso, y lo rompio todo\\
235 - para que se puso el vestido\\
236 - si sabia que no iba a caber?\\
237 - Gracias.\\
238 - Now I got to get a new costume.\\
239 - Oh, no, you don't, Mr. Ricardo.\\
240 - It's only split in the seams.\\
241 - I can sew it up myself.\\
242 - Now, look, never mind.
Just take it off\\
243 - and leave it in the dressing room\\
244 - and don't call us, we'll call you.\\
245 - Oh, but Mr. Ricardo...
What?\\
246 - If I get thin enough to fit the
dress,\\
247 - can I have the part?\\
248 - Look, the number goes in by Saturday.\\
249 - You couldn't possibly get thin enough
by then.\\
250 - But if I can, can I?\\
251 - All right, all right.\\
252 - Now, good-bye, good-bye.\\
253 - You heard him, Ethel.\\
254 - If I get thin enough to fit the
dress, I can have the part.\\
255 - Do you really think you can take off
12 pounds in four days?\\
256 - I'm going to get rid of this fat\\
257 - if I have to chop it off with a
cleaver.\\
258 - Hey, wait!\\
259 - That was the last lap.\\
260 - Oh, that's great.\\
261 - You did that in 2Â½ minutes flat.\\
262 - You now hold the national indoor
record\\
263 - for the around-the- fourth-floor
dash.\\
264 - You've done good work.\\
265 - You deserve a rest period.\\
266 - Thanks.\\
267 - Okay, time's up.\\
268 - Now, you have time\\
269 - to jump this rope 500 times\\
270 - before the boys come home for dinner.\\
271 - Two hundred?\\
272 - One hundred?\\
273 - Well, do as many as you can.\\
274 - Uh... one!\\
275 - Uh... two!\\
276 - Uh... higher!\\
277 - Oh, you poor little thing.\\
278 - You've worked very hard.\\
279 - Let's weigh you in.\\
280 - Come on.\\
281 - Stiffen up, Lucy.\\
282 - Another five ounces.\\
283 - In three days, you've lost almost two
pounds.\\
284 - Keen.\\
285 - Oh, don't get discouraged.\\
286 - Only ten pounds more to go.\\
287 - We'll get you into size 12.\\
288 - Yeah, a size-12 shroud.\\
289 - Now, take a shower and clean up.\\
290 - I'll get dinner.\\
291 - Dinner?\\
292 - Okay.\\
293 - What's the matter?\\
294 - I can't seem to move.\\
295 - Could you point me in the right
direction?\\
296 - Thanks.\\
297 - Here you are, Ricky.\\
298 - Oh, thank you.\\
299 - Here you are, Fred, a nice juicy
steak.\\
300 - Oh, I love steak.\\
301 - I hope you don't mind us bringing
Butch along?\\
302 - Not at all.\\
303 - If he behaves himself, we'll give him
the bone.\\
304 - Oh, he's a good dog.
Best dog in the...\\
305 - Here you are, Lucy.\\
306 - Oh, no, that's yours.\\
307 - How's your steak, Fred?\\
308 - Perfect-- just the way I like it.\\
309 - Is your steak all right, Ricky?\\
310 - Oh, delicious.
How's yours?\\
311 - Fine, nice and tender.
Good.\\
312 - How's your celery, Lucy?\\
313 - Oh, delicious, thanks.\\
314 - Is it cooked enough for you?\\
315 - Oh, yes, just the way I like it, nice
and tender.\\
316 - Will you pass the potatoes, Rick?\\
317 - Sure thing, here you go.\\
318 - Thanks.\\
319 - Oh, could I have a biscuit, Fred?\\
320 - Sure, you can have a biscuit.\\
321 - Excuse me.\\
322 - Thank you.\\
323 - Want a biscuit, Ricky?\\
324 - Mm-hmm.\\
325 - Thank you.\\
326 - Hey, Fred, could I have the potatoes
back, please?\\
327 - Sure, you may.\\
328 - Thank you, Fred.\\
329 - You know, I'm forgetting about poor,
old Butch.\\
330 - Hey, yeah, don't forget about him.\\
331 - I'm going to give him\\
332 - a nice, juicy piece of this steak.\\
333 - Do you mind?
Go ahead.\\
334 - Come on, Butch.\\
335 - Sit up there, boy.\\
336 - There you are.\\
337 - Sit up now.\\
338 - There you go.\\
339 - You going to thank me?\\
340 - Huh?\\
341 - Well, I can't stand anymore.\\
342 - I'll be back later.\\
343 - Ah! Stay out of the kitchen.\\
344 - How about another biscuit,
Ethel?\\
345 - Uh-huh.\\
346 - There you are.\\
347 - Hey, Fred,\\
348 - string beans?\\
349 - Sure, these are good for you.\\
350 - Full of iron.\\
351 - There you are, Ricky.\\
352 - Thank you.\\
353 - Hey, I didn't give Butch anything.\\
354 - Here you are, Butch.\\
355 - Aren't you going to thank me?\\
356 - Nice Butch, nice Butch.\\
357 - Who's under there?\\
358 - Who's under the table?\\
359 - Nobody here but us dogs.\\
360 - Lucy.\\
361 - Come out from under the table.\\
362 - Now, what do you got to say for
yourself?\\
363 - Lucy.\\
364 - All right, you don't have to get
nasty about it, I'm leaving.\\
365 - Where are you going?\\
366 - I'm going down to the corner bakery\\
367 - and smell the bread.\\
368 - Okay, Lucy, let's get started on our
road work for the day.\\
369 - What's that?\\
370 - A human pressure cooker.\\
371 - Where'd you get it?\\
372 - I rented it.\\
373 - You really are determined, aren't
you?\\
374 - Of course-- I'm going to do\\
375 - that number with Ricky tonight.\\
376 - Did you lose enough weight?\\
377 - I've got five more pounds to lose\\
378 - and five hours to do it in.\\
379 - This is my last day.\\
380 - If you spend five hours in that\\
381 - it really will be your last day.\\
382 - Well, it's my only chance, Ethel.\\
383 - Okay, I only hope you know what
you're doing.\\
384 - I do.\\
385 - Check me at 6:00 tonight.\\
386 - You're not really going to spend\\
387 - all that time in there?\\
388 - I certainly am.\\
389 - All right.\\
390 - They'll have to pick you up with a
blotter.\\
391 - Okay, honey, it's 6:00.\\
392 - How are you doing?\\
393 - Lucy!\\
394 - Where are you?\\
395 - Lucy!\\
396 - Lucy.\\
397 - Is this all that's left?\\
398 - Practically.\\
399 - Oh, Lucy, you gave me an awful
fright.\\
400 - Thank heavens you're here.\\
401 - I'm here, all right.\\
402 - 120 pounds of me.\\
403 - You did it.\\
404 - I'm going down to the club and do
that number.\\
405 - What about that other girl Ricky
hired?\\
406 - I'll take care of her somehow.\\
407 - Do you really think you can make it?\\
408 - Oh, don't worry.\\
409 - I'm as strong as...
as a very weak horse\\
410 - but I'll make it.\\
411 - They call me Cuban Pete\\
412 - I'm the king of the rumba beat\\
413 - When I play the maracas\\
414 - I go chick-chicky-boom,
chick-chicky-boom\\
415 - Yes, sir, I'm Cuban Pete\\
416 - I'm the craze of my native street\\
417 - When I start to dance\\
418 - Everything goes chick-chicky- boom,
chick-chicky-boom\\
419 - There's seÃ±oritas, they sing and how
they swing\\
420 - With this rumbero\\
421 - It's very nice\\
422 - So full of spice\\
423 - And when they're dancing\\
424 - They bring a happy ring of vaqueros\\
425 - Singing a song all the day long\\
426 - So if you like the beat, take a
lesson from Cuban Pete\\
427 - And I'll teach you to
chick-chicky-boom\\
428 - Chick-chicky-boom, chick-chicky-boom\\
429 - Si, seÃ±orita, I know\\
430 - That you will like the
chicky-boom-chick\\
431 - Because it's the dance of Latin
romance\\
432 - And Cuban Pete doesn't teach you in a
hurry\\
433 - Like Arthur Murray\\
434 - I come from Havana and there's always
maÃ±ana.\\
435 - So seÃ±orita...\\
436 - Oh, no.\\
437 - They call me Sally Sweet\\
438 - I'm the queen of Delancy Street\\
439 - When I start to dance\\
440 - Everything goes chick-chicky-boom\\
441 - Chick-chicky-boom.\\
442 - Ay-ya-ya-ya-ya.\\
443 - Excuse me, Mr. Pete.\\
444 - Yes, ma'am.\\
445 - Have the Cubans a different beat?\\
446 - If they have, will you teach me\\
447 - To chick-chicky-boom
chick-chicky-boom?\\
448 - Si, seÃ±orita\\
449 - I know that you will like\\
450 - The chicky-boom-chick.\\
451 - Yeah, man.\\
452 - It's very nice\\
453 - So full of spice\\
454 - I place my hand on your hip\\
455 - And if you will, just give me your
hand\\
456 - Then we shall try\\
457 - Just you and I.\\
458 - Hey! Hey!\\
459 - Hey!\\
460 - Ricky?\\
461 - Yes, Lucy?\\
462 - Do I get to be in the show every
night now, Ricky?\\
463 - Well, I'm afraid not, honey.\\
464 - You were wonderful, but the doctors
say\\
465 - you got to stay in bed for three
weeks.\\
466 - You're suffering from malnutrition.\\
467 - Ew...
\subsection {Episode 04: Lucy Thinks Ricky Is Trying To Murder Her (1951)}
1 - Hi, honey! Look what I got.\\
2 - Pretty good, eh?\\
3 - "Held over! Ricky Ricardo and his
orchestra\\
4 - at the beautiful Tropicana."\\
5 - Yes, sir...
isn't that wonderful?\\
6 - They want us to stay another four
weeks.\\
7 - If everything goes as well as it did
tonight,\\
8 - we'll stay there a hundred years.\\
9 - I took so many bows tonight\\
10 - that I got a charley horse in my hip.\\
11 - Boy, they sure recognize talent when
they see it.\\
12 - Good night.\\
13 - Oh...\\
14 - My goodness, you scared me!\\
15 - When did you sneak in here?\\
16 - A couple of minutes ago.\\
17 - Oh, I must have been so interested in
my book.\\
18 - Where did my book go?
Where is my book?\\
19 - It went out the window.\\
20 - Out the window?\\
21 - I don't see it anywhere.\\
22 - Of course not-- it's dark out there.\\
23 - Good night.\\
24 - Ricky...\\
25 - What?\\
26 - One of us ought to get up and go down
and get it.\\
27 - One of us?\\
28 - Yes.\\
29 - Which one of us did you have in mind?\\
30 - Oh, the one that's the biggest and
the strongest.\\
31 - Okay.\\
32 - Go ahead.\\
33 - Oh, Ricky.\\
34 - Now, look, honey,\\
35 - I'm a husband, not a retriever.\\
36 - Good night.\\
37 - How can I go to sleep till I know who
killed her?\\
38 - Let's see... it was either the
upstairs maid\\
39 - or the butler or the cook.\\
40 - It was her husband.\\
41 - Her husband? He didn't have any
reason to kill her.\\
42 - He was married, wasn't he?\\
43 - Oh...\\
44 - I can see it all now:\\
45 - He worked very hard all day.\\
46 - Got home about 2:00 in the morning.\\
47 - She started pestering him.\\
48 - Wouldn't let him sleep.\\
49 - He stood it as long as he could.\\
50 - Finally, he decided to do away with
her.\\
51 - So he got out of bed...\\
52 - ...looked around for a murder weapon.\\
53 - A gun!\\
54 - Nah... make too much noise.\\
55 - A knife! Aha!\\
56 - Too sloppy.\\
57 - Aha!\\
58 - A scarf.\\
59 - Perfect.\\
60 - It would do the job quietly and
neatly.\\
61 - Slowly he approaches the bed,\\
62 - murder in his heart.\\
63 - And then...\\
64 - Good morning, Lucy.\\
65 - I had the most exciting time last
night.\\
66 - I learned how...\\
67 - What's that you're reading?\\
68 - Lucy...\\
69 - Gosh, did I scare you?\\
70 - No, no. I was just getting ready to
scream\\
71 - and throw my book out the window
anyway.\\
72 - I'm sorry.\\
73 - Gee, no wonder they call it\\
74 - The Mockingbird Murder Mystery.\\
75 - Every time I get that book in my
hand,\\
76 - it flies out the window.\\
77 - Oh, Lucy, forget that book.\\
78 - I had the most exciting time last
night.\\
79 - I learned how to tell fortunes with
playing cards.\\
80 - Come on in, I'll tell your fortune.\\
81 - Look, Ethel, we just rent this
apartment from you.\\
82 - It doesn't say anything in the lease\\
83 - about having to have our fortune
told.\\
84 - Besides, I don't believe in that
silly stuff.\\
85 - Oh, but this system never fails.\\
86 - It's just fantastic the stuff we
learned last night.\\
87 - Well, maybe the cards will tell you
where my book is.\\
88 - Now, Lucy, you've got to be serious,\\
89 - or the cards won't tell you anything.\\
90 - Oh, I'm so sorry.\\
91 - Okay... serious.\\
92 - Now, we have here...\\
93 - Wait a minute, Ethel, what's wrong
with these cards?\\
94 - Oh, look, let's forget the
fortune-telling.\\
95 - You're right, there's nothing to it.\\
96 - Yeah, I know there's nothing to it,\\
97 - but I want to know what it is there's
nothing to.\\
98 - Oh, but really, Lucy...\\
99 - Why did you look like you did\\
100 - when you saw these cards?\\
101 - No, Lucy, please.\\
102 - Now, what does this grubby little
group of cards\\
103 - have to say for itself?\\
104 - Well...\\
105 - this is your card.\\
106 - The queen of hearts-- that's you.
Yeah.\\
107 - And this card right next to it is...\\
108 - the ace of spades.\\
109 - What does that mean?\\
110 - Death.\\
111 - Death!\\
112 - Well, what's it doing so close to me?\\
113 - That's just it.\\
114 - When your card is next to the ace of
spades,\\
115 - that means you're going to be...
dead.\\
116 - Dead?\\
117 - Like in "as a doornail"?\\
118 - Oh, what's the matter with me?\\
119 - I don't believe in fortune-telling.\\
120 - I don't either.\\
121 - Well, what are you laughing at?\\
122 - I'm laughing at fortune-telling\\
123 - because it's so silly.\\
124 - Do you know anyone who would like to
kill you?\\
125 - No.\\
126 - Well, then, you can see...\\
127 - Wait a minute, wait a minute.\\
128 - Last night I thought Ricky was going
to.\\
129 - Ricky?!\\
130 - Yeah... oh, but he was just kidding.\\
131 - I think.\\
132 - The phone.\\
133 - Oh...\\
134 - Hello?\\
135 - Oh, Ricky got it.\\
136 - I'd better get him some coffee.\\
137 - Hello, Ricky?\\
138 - Yeah. Who's this?\\
139 - This is Jerry, your agent, remember?\\
140 - Oh, yeah.\\
141 - Yeah, I'm way over in Jersey.\\
142 - Listen, I signed up that dog act for
you.\\
143 - They're all set for next week.\\
144 - Good, good.\\
145 - Yeah, and now I got to go see a
talking seal.\\
146 - Talking seal?\\
147 - Does he do an act?\\
148 - No, no. The seal is the manager.\\
149 - He's got a couple of trained people.\\
150 - You're daffy.\\
151 - Hey, listen, I want to give you the
dope on the dogs.\\
152 - You have to get it to the publicity
department\\
153 - this morning, or it'll never get out
on time.\\
154 - Okay, Jerry, wait a minute, will you?\\
155 - All right.\\
156 - Wait a minute.\\
157 - Give me their names.\\
158 - Ann...\\
159 - Ann.\\
160 - Mary...\\
161 - Mary.\\
162 - Helen...\\
163 - Helen.\\
164 - Cynthia...\\
165 - Cynthia.\\
166 - Alice...\\
167 - Alice.\\
168 - ...and Theodore.\\
169 - Theodore.\\
170 - Yeah.\\
171 - These are dogs?\\
172 - Well, that's the way they want to be
billed.\\
173 - Oh, and listen, while I think of it,
you know,\\
174 - your budget can't afford all those
dogs and a girl singer.\\
175 - Now, what are you going to do about
Marilyn?\\
176 - Oh, I didn't tell you, huh?\\
177 - Well, I've been wondering what to do
about her for a long time.\\
178 - I finally made up my mind.\\
179 - I'm going to get rid of her.\\
180 - Yeah, she's been with me a long time,
Jerry,\\
181 - and that's the trouble--\\
182 - she's been with me too long.\\
183 - After all, the same face night after
night\\
184 - gets pretty tiresome.\\
185 - I'll... I'll probably miss her some,\\
186 - but in a couple of weeks,\\
187 - I'll get another one\\
188 - and she'll be just as good.\\
189 - Maybe even better.\\
190 - Yeah, well, I guess you're right.\\
191 - A girl singer isn't the most
important thing in the world.\\
192 - Oh, before I forget,\\
193 - did you pick up that trick gadget for
the Western number?\\
194 - The gun? Yeah, I got it right here\\
195 - in my desk drawer.\\
196 - Oh, that's a good deal.\\
197 - Okay, then, I'll see you later, then.\\
198 - Good-bye, Jerry.\\
199 - Oh, hiya, honey.\\
200 - Hi! Hi.\\
201 - Listen, I have to rush right down to
the club,\\
202 - so I'll get breakfast down there.\\
203 - Bye.\\
204 - Good-bye.\\
205 - Oh...\\
206 - I'll be back in a couple of hours.\\
207 - Bye.\\
208 - Uh-oh, I forgot.\\
209 - Ethel! Ethel!\\
210 - What's the matter?\\
211 - You're looking at a future doornail.\\
212 - Huh?\\
213 - Ricky just tried to kill me.\\
214 - Really? Then I'm a better\\
215 - fortune-teller than I thought.\\
216 - What am I saying?\\
217 - What are you talking about?\\
218 - I overheard him on the phone.\\
219 - He's been planning this a long time,\\
220 - and he finally decided to do it.\\
221 - Last night was just a dress
rehearsal.\\
222 - Oh, no, Lucy, you must have
misunderstood him.\\
223 - No, I didn't.\\
224 - He took a shot at me already, but he
missed.\\
225 - Was that the noise I heard just now?\\
226 - Yeah. he bought a gun especially for
it.\\
227 - Let's see if it's in that desk.\\
228 - Oh, you poor, poor thing.\\
229 - What's that?\\
230 - Ricky wrote something\\
231 - while he was talking on the phone\\
232 - and he blotted it on this blotter.\\
233 - Where are you going?\\
234 - Mirror.
Mirror?\\
235 - Yeah.
Oh, so you can read it.\\
236 - My, you're clever.\\
237 - I don't read mystery books for
nothing.\\
238 - "Helen, Ann, Mary..."\\
239 - What's it mean?\\
240 - I'm not even cold yet,\\
241 - and Ricky's lining up girls to take
my place.\\
242 - "Helen, Ann, Mary, Cynthia, Alice,
Theodore."\\
243 - Theodore?\\
244 - Oh! It's you.\\
245 - I thought it was Ricky.\\
246 - Well, what are you going to do?\\
247 - Just stay here and wait for him to
shoot you?\\
248 - Oh, I thought maybe I could talk to
him,\\
249 - make him change his mind.\\
250 - Are you crazy?\\
251 - I still love him, Ethel.\\
252 - Well, all I've got to say is, Lucy,
you're awfully brave.\\
253 - Oh, I'm not brave at all.
I'm scared to death.\\
254 - Every time I think about it,\\
255 - I get a sinking feeling right here.\\
256 - You get a sinking feeling where?\\
257 - Here.\\
258 - Here?\\
259 - What's that?\\
260 - Bulletproof vest.\\
261 - And that's not all I bulletproofed.\\
262 - That's in case he shoots me in the
back.\\
263 - I got it all figured out, Ethel.\\
264 - I'm going to stand right up to him,\\
265 - and when he comes in that door,\\
266 - I'm going to say, "Okay, Ricky, okay.\\
267 - What seems to be the trouble between
us?"\\
268 - What are you doing?\\
269 - A moving target is harder to hit.\\
270 - Lucy!\\
271 - It's Ricky!\\
272 - Where are you, Lucy?\\
273 - Save me, save me!\\
274 - Who's going to save me?\\
275 - He won't shoot you, it's me he's
after.\\
276 - Yes, but to get to you, he's got to
go through me.\\
277 - Lucy!\\
278 - Let me go.\\
279 - Ethel, Ethel, you can't do this to
me.\\
280 - You're my best friend.\\
281 - I know I'm your best friend.\\
282 - That's why I can't stand to see you\\
283 - riddled with bullets.\\
284 - But Ethel!\\
285 - Ethel! Ethel!\\
286 - Oh, hello, honey, there you are.\\
287 - What's the matter with you, you got
an itch or something?\\
288 - No, nothing's the matter with me.\\
289 - What's new?\\
290 - What's new?!\\
291 - I can't go on.\\
292 - I give up.\\
293 - Go ahead, shoot.\\
294 - Shoot who?\\
295 - Me.\\
296 - Don't talk silly.\\
297 - Oh, you're getting smart, huh?\\
298 - Guns make noise, the neighbors might
hear.\\
299 - So you're going to strangle me.\\
300 - I'm not going to shoot you,\\
301 - and I'm not going to strangle you.\\
302 - Fortunately, I'm too big for the
garbage disposal.\\
303 - Lucy, for goodness' sakes...\\
304 - Honey...\\
305 - Lucy, what's the matter with you?\\
306 - Nothing, and there isn't gonna be,
either.\\
307 - Honey! Lucy!\\
308 - Come out here, honey.\\
309 - Come on, what's the matter with you?\\
310 - Go away!\\
311 - Open the door, honey!\\
312 - Come on, honey, open the door!\\
313 - Go away!\\
314 - Open the door, honey!\\
315 - Honey, please, open the door!\\
316 - Come on, honey,\\
317 - come on, what's the matter with you?\\
318 - Hey, Ricky, what's going on up here?\\
319 - Oh, hello, Fred.\\
320 - Ethel came running down to our place\\
321 - and told me to hurry up here right
away.\\
322 - What's the matter?\\
323 - Don't ask me, Fred-- Lucy's acting
crazy.\\
324 - Crazy for Lucy, or crazy for ordinary
people?\\
325 - Crazy for anybody.\\
326 - She seems to have some idea\\
327 - that I'm going to kill her.\\
328 - That doesn't mean anything.\\
329 - Sooner or later every married woman
decides\\
330 - that her husband wants to kill her.\\
331 - She's usually right.\\
332 - Look, Fred, please, this is no time
for jokes.\\
333 - She's really upset.\\
334 - I've never seen her like this way
before.\\
335 - Look, I got to go to the club\\
336 - I got a big rehearsal over there.\\
337 - I don't want to leave her alone here
tonight.\\
338 - There's only one thing you can do.\\
339 - The same thing I do with Ethel when
she gets upset.\\
340 - What's that?\\
341 - Slip her a Mickey.\\
342 - A Mickey?\\
343 - Well, not really a Mickey...
unfortunately.\\
344 - Just a mild sedative.\\
345 - Here, I've got one here-- wait.\\
346 - That's a stomach capsule.\\
347 - Oh, there's that button\\
348 - I want sewed back on my pants.\\
349 - Here... here it is-- here's the
sedative.\\
350 - Oh, great. If she thinks I'm gonna
kill her,\\
351 - you don't think she's...
she'll take this, do you?\\
352 - Just drop that in a glass of soda
water\\
353 - and she'll never know the difference.\\
354 - Well, it's not a bad idea, but I
don't know.\\
355 - Now, that'll put her to sleep for the
rest of the night.\\
356 - You go on down to the club.\\
357 - I'll look in from time to time\\
358 - and see that she's all right.\\
359 - Well, thanks, amigo, I hope it works.\\
360 - Don't you worry about a thing.\\
361 - Lucy!\\
362 - Yeah-yeah?\\
363 - Come on, honey, have a drink.\\
364 - Well, I...\\
365 - I'm not really very thirsty.\\
366 - Oh, come on, sweetheart, it'll do you
good.\\
367 - Come on, honey, come on.\\
368 - Well, all right.\\
369 - Let's dance.\\
370 - Dance?\\
371 - Yeah, I haven't danced in a long
time.\\
372 - Put your glass down here.\\
373 - But honey, there's no music.\\
374 - Oh, who needs music?
You dance divinely.\\
375 - That's enough dancing, let's drink.\\
376 - Look at that!
What?\\
377 - That is the biggest spider I've ever
seen.\\
378 - Where? Where?
I don't see anything.\\
379 - Well, I gu...
I guess I was mistaken.\\
380 - Oh. Well, let's drink.\\
381 - Salud.\\
382 - Gesundheit.\\
383 - No, wait!\\
384 - What was that for?\\
385 - I can't do it to you\\
386 - even though you would do it to me.\\
387 - What are you talking about?\\
388 - I switched glasses.\\
389 - I know you did, I switched them back.\\
390 - You mean... you mean, I got the one
with th-th-the...\\
391 - You certainly did.\\
392 - Ricky... Ricky, come here, I want to
talk to you.\\
393 - Ricky, no matter what you've done,\\
394 - I forgive you.\\
395 - Thank you.\\
396 - You're welcome.\\
397 - Gee, that's a powerful sleeping
powder.\\
398 - Sleeping powder, ha!\\
399 - The sleep from which no one returns.\\
400 - Oh, honey, come on, you'd better lie
down.\\
401 - Let me help you lie down.\\
402 - Lie down, honey, lie down.\\
403 - Don't rush me!\\
404 - I'll be lying down for a long, long
time.\\
405 - Boy, that certainly did the trick.\\
406 - Where's Ricky?\\
407 - He's gone. Are you all right, Lucy?\\
408 - What happened?\\
409 - I got a Mickey from Ricky.\\
410 - This is it, Ethel.\\
411 - You're just in time to say good-bye.\\
412 - Good-bye, Lucy.\\
413 - Good-bye.\\
414 - How long do you think I've got?\\
415 - Not long.\\
416 - I've got time.\\
417 - I've got to.\\
418 - What are you going to do?\\
419 - I'm going down to Ricky's club.\\
420 - If I can't have him, nobody else can.\\
421 - I'll come with you.\\
422 - Get your coat.\\
423 - I'm going to rub him out\\
424 - with the same gun he was going to use
on me.\\
425 - All right, Ricky!\\
426 - Lucy!\\
427 - Lucy, what are you doing?\\
428 - You know what I'm doing.\\
429 - Honey, don't make a scene.\\
430 - Hector, they're wonderful, they're
really great\\
431 - particularly Mary and Cynthia.\\
432 - Mary and Cynthia?\\
433 - Did you write their names down\\
434 - on the telephone pad?\\
435 - Yes. That's Ann, Helen, Mary,
Cynthia, Alice\\
436 - and that's Theodore.\\
437 - That's Theodore.\\
438 - Then that really was a sleeping
powder in my drink.\\
439 - Certainly.\\
440 - Well, then, what are you doing with
that gun?\\
441 - I was going to shoot you.\\
442 - Oh, honey.\\
443 - Hi, honey.\\
444 - The opening was wonderful!\\
445 - We were sensational.\\
446 - Good night.\\
447 - I hope this time you can't find it.
\subsection {Episode 05: The Quiz Show (1951)}
1 - Good morning, Lucy.\\
2 - Fortunately, I'm not the sensitive
type.\\
3 - Oh, I'm sorry, Ethel.\\
4 - I'm so terribly busy.\\
5 - You know what day this is, don't you?\\
6 - What day is it?\\
7 - This is the day Ricky goes over my
household accounts.\\
8 - Well, so long.\\
9 - Oh, now, Ethel, don't go.\\
10 - I need your moral support.\\
11 - I don't think I'll ever get it
figured out.\\
12 - I know I'm a fool to ask this\\
13 - but what are you doing?\\
14 - This is my system for paying bills.\\
15 - See, I throw them all up in the air,\\
16 - and those that land face up are the
winners.\\
17 - By the winners, you mean the ones you
pay?\\
18 - Uh-huh.\\
19 - Well, what happens if they all land
face up?\\
20 - Well, then I just switch.\\
21 - I only pay the ones that land
facedown.\\
22 - That figures.\\
23 - Oh, what's the use?\\
24 - I can't afford to pay any bills this
month.\\
25 - Honey!\\
26 - Yes, dear.\\
27 - Are your books ready for me to see?\\
28 - Yes.\\
29 - Let me know how you come out.\\
30 - All right.\\
31 - Okay, let's see what shape your
accounts are in this month.\\
32 - I'm afraid...\\
33 - Well, honey, if you're too busy this
morning...\\
34 - Oh, no, no, no, no.\\
35 - I wouldn't miss this\\
36 - for all the money in the world.\\
37 - And that's probably what it'll cost
me.\\
38 - Hmm...\\
39 - hmm...\\
40 - Is it interesting?\\
41 - Very.\\
42 - 50 cents for the newsboy.\\
43 - 39 cents for toothpaste.\\
44 - 15 cents for nail polish.\\
45 - $245 for miscellaneous.\\
46 - Miscellaneous?\\
47 - Yeah, miscellaneous.\\
48 - Would you mind telling me\\
49 - what comes under miscellaneous?\\
50 - Oh, you know, rent, groceries,
telephone, electric, gas--\\
51 - stuff like that.\\
52 - Oh, that kind of miscellaneous.\\
53 - Yeah.\\
54 - Uh-huh.\\
55 - Well, I'm glad to see you paid this
month's bills.\\
56 - Well, they're not exactly this
month's bills.\\
57 - Oh? They're last month's?\\
58 - No, they're not last month's either.\\
59 - You don't mean they're the month
before last?\\
60 - No, but you're getting warmer.\\
61 - What month's bills are you paying
now?\\
62 - Jingle bells, jingle bells\\
63 - Jingle all the way\\
64 - Oh, what fun it is to ride...\\
65 - Wait, wait, wait.\\
66 - Morbid curiosity makes me want to see
more.\\
67 - The lights have not been paid.\\
68 - The water hasn't been paid.\\
69 - The phone hasn't been paid.\\
70 - Why they haven't been turned off, I
don't know.\\
71 - Well, I've been going around stalling
our creditors.\\
72 - Huh?\\
73 - I jollied them out of it.\\
74 - Oh, you did.\\
75 - Yeah, except that this month\\
76 - I'm afraid they're going to want more
money and less jolly.\\
77 - Lucy, this is absolutely fantastic.\\
78 - It's just unbelievable.\\
79 - I would like a logical explanation of
it.\\
80 - Well, I'd like a "lowgical
splanation" of it, too.\\
81 - I make good money.\\
82 - I bring it home and it disappears.\\
83 - Now, what have you been doing with
it?\\
84 - I sank it all in a phony gold mine.\\
85 - That's very funny.\\
86 - I thought you'd like it.\\
87 - Yeah. Well, I got something very
funny to tell you, too.\\
88 - Oh, you have?
Yes, I have.\\
89 - You know, you've used up your
allowance\\
90 - until next February.\\
91 - And you're not going to get\\
92 - any more money until then.\\
93 - But, Ricky...\\
94 - And not only that, but you can't have
any more charge accounts.\\
95 - I will handle all the money\\
96 - and pay all the bills.\\
97 - Now, isn't that funny?\\
98 - But, Ricky, you can't do that to me.\\
99 - Well, now, honey, I know that this
seems very harsh to you right now,\\
100 - but we got to get our finances in
order\\
101 - and teach you a lesson\\
102 - and this is the only way.\\
103 - But, Ricky, you're so smart.\\
104 - Can't you think of another way?\\
105 - No!\\
106 - Look, if you can get the bills paid\\
107 - we'll go back to the old arrangement.\\
108 - Until then, it's got to be this way.\\
109 - Now, come on, come on.\\
110 - Give me a kiss.\\
111 - Hmm, salty but nice.\\
112 - See you later.\\
113 - How'd it go?\\
114 - Oh, just awful.\\
115 - He did something he's never done
before.\\
116 - What?\\
117 - He cut off my charge-a-plate.\\
118 - No!\\
119 - Yes, and it hurt, too.\\
120 - Aw, you poor little thing.\\
121 - Hey, I'm on my way to a radio show\\
122 - and I got two tickets.\\
123 - Why don't you come go with me?\\
124 - It'll take your mind off your
troubles.\\
125 - No.\\
126 - Oh, come on, it's the Freddie Filmore
Show.\\
127 - You know, the one called Females Are
Fabulous.\\
128 - I just came from a show called
"Husbands Are Horrible."\\
129 - Come on, put your coat on.\\
130 - No, if there's one thing I don't feel
like doing today,\\
131 - it's going to a radio show.\\
132 - But you might win a prize.\\
133 - Well, you go ahead, Ethel.\\
134 - The first prize is a thousand
dollars.\\
135 - Well, what would I do with a thousand
dol...\\
136 - A thousand dollars?!\\
137 - Uh-huh.
Well, come on, what are we waiting
for?\\
138 - Well!\\
139 - Females are Fabulous.\\
140 - Welcome to another session\\
141 - of Females Are Fabulous,\\
142 - our very outstanding program based on
the theory\\
143 - that any woman is willing\\
144 - to make an idiot out of herself\\
145 - in order to win a prize.\\
146 - Now, our first contestant today, a
lovely little lady\\
147 - who's going to try for our thousand
dollar jackpot,\\
148 - Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.\\
149 - Come on out here, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
150 - Oh, we're going to have a lot of fun\\
151 - aren't we, Mrs. Ricardo?\\
152 - Yeah.\\
153 - Tell me, how would you like to go to
the beach this afternoon?\\
154 - Oh, I'd like that.
You'd like that.\\
155 - Well, of course, we can't go to the
beach\\
156 - so we're going to do the next best
thing:\\
157 - we're going to bring the beach to
you.\\
158 - Bring the beach in here, fellows.\\
159 - Come on, get it right in here.\\
160 - That's it, set it right down there.\\
161 - Oh, isn't that a beautiful beach?\\
162 - Come on, right onto the beach.\\
163 - That's it, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
164 - Oh, look at that sand.\\
165 - Isn't that beautiful?\\
166 - Hey, why don't you take off your
shoes\\
167 - so you can wiggle your toes in the
sand?\\
168 - Don't you always do that when you're
down at the beach?\\
169 - Yes.
It's a lot of fun, isn't it?\\
170 - Get it on her, boys, get it on her.\\
171 - That's it.\\
172 - Oh, say, isn't that beautiful?\\
173 - I tell you,\\
174 - that really does something for you.\\
175 - Long bathing suit.\\
176 - Yes, sir.\\
177 - Oh, and then, too,\\
178 - we've got a beach umbrella here.\\
179 - You know, we wouldn't want you to get
sunburned.\\
180 - The sun's awfully bright down here at
the beach\\
181 - and we do want you to feel...\\
182 - Oh, that's real fetching, that is.\\
183 - Yes, sir.\\
184 - Yes, sir, that really does something
for you.\\
185 - You all ready for our little game
now?\\
186 - Well, I'll tell you what we want you
to do.\\
187 - You know the song\\
188 - "My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean"?\\
189 - Uh, yeah.\\
190 - You do? Lovely little song, isn't it?\\
191 - Yeah.\\
192 - Well, what we want you to do is sing
that song,\\
193 - and every time you mention something\\
194 - that has to do with water\\
195 - we're going to do our best to make
you feel\\
196 - that you're right down at the beach.\\
197 - Are you ready?\\
198 - Yeah.\\
199 - Okay, you go ahead.\\
200 - My... My bonnie lies over the
ocean...\\
201 - My bonnie lies over the sea...\\
202 - My bonnie lies over the ocean...\\
203 - Oh, bring back my bonnie to me.\\
204 - Oh, no, now that time, you see, I
didn't squirt you\\
205 - because the last line had nothing to
do with water.\\
206 - Now, do you get the idea of our
little game?\\
207 - Yes, I see.\\
208 - Sea!\\
209 - Listen, I've got a notion...\\
210 - An ocean!\\
211 - Oh, that was wonderful, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
212 - Yes, sir.\\
213 - How about giving her a big hand,
folks?\\
214 - Oh, naughty, naughty, naughty, Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
215 - Well, where's my thousand dollars?\\
216 - Oh, no, no, you don't get the
thousand dollars for this.\\
217 - This was just a little test\\
218 - to see if you qualify for the
thousand dollars.\\
219 - And she does qualify, doesn't she,
audience?\\
220 - Yes, sir.\\
221 - Now, in just a minute, I'm going to
tell you\\
222 - the simple little thing you have to
do\\
223 - in order to actually win the thousand
dollars.\\
224 - But first we want to present a check
for a thousand dollars\\
225 - to the winner of last week's jackpot,
Mrs. Peterson.\\
226 - Come right on in here, Mrs. Peterson.\\
227 - Well, now, Mrs. Peterson,\\
228 - it wasn't so tough going over Niagara
Falls\\
229 - in a barrel, was it?\\
230 - Well, here's your check.\\
231 - She seems to be a little shaken up.\\
232 - Yeah, well, I'll be seeing you.\\
233 - Oh, no, no, Mrs. Ricardo, now you
stay right here.\\
234 - This next little stunt is very
simple.\\
235 - It is?
Oh, yes, yes.\\
236 - I take it you're married?\\
237 - Yes.\\
238 - Never been married before?\\
239 - No.\\
240 - You've never been married before.\\
241 - Well, now, I'll tell you what's going
to happen.\\
242 - We're going to send a man out to your
house\\
243 - and you introduce him to your
husband.\\
244 - Where's the catch?\\
245 - Catch?\\
246 - The gimmick.\\
247 - Oh, I did forget one simple little
thing, yes sirree.\\
248 - You're to introduce this man to your
husband\\
249 - as your long-lost first husband.\\
250 - My long-lost first what?\\
251 - You don't seem to get the picture.\\
252 - Now, look, you're sitting at home at
8:00 tonight,\\
253 - this man comes and knocks on the
door.\\
254 - You open the door, you greet him with
tears in your eyes,\\
255 - you pull him into the room\\
256 - and you introduce him to your present
husband\\
257 - as your first husband\\
258 - whom you thought had disappeared.\\
259 - But what will my husband say?\\
260 - That's what we want to know,\\
261 - isn't it, audience?\\
262 - Yes, sir, now, Mrs. Ricardo\\
263 - if you can keep up this little
masquerade\\
264 - until midnight tonight,\\
265 - our man is going to give you this
$1,000.\\
266 - $1,000?\\
267 - How about it?\\
268 - How about letting me go over Niagara
Falls in a paper bag?\\
269 - Ah, no.\\
270 - Now, you have exactly three seconds\\
271 - to make up your mind.\\
272 - One... two... three!\\
273 - I'll do it!\\
274 - I knew you would\\
275 - because I always say "Females Are
Fabulous"!\\
276 - Give her a big hand, folks!
Come on!\\
277 - Well, that takes care of everything
on today's program\\
278 - except Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.\\
279 - Here's her address.\\
280 - Now, let me get this straight.\\
281 - I show up there at 8:00 tonight,\\
282 - And she'll introduce me as her first
husband.\\
283 - That's right.\\
284 - Now, here's the thousand dollars.\\
285 - She keeps up the pretense until
midnight\\
286 - you give her the money.
Got it.\\
287 - Good luck.\\
288 - I'll need it.\\
289 - What a way to make a living.\\
290 - I'll get it.\\
291 - Get what?\\
292 - Somebody knocked.\\
293 - I was trying to make the lighter
work.\\
294 - Oh.\\
295 - Why, are you expecting someone?\\
296 - Who, me?\\
297 - Who would I be expecting\\
298 - at this time of night?\\
299 - Lucy, you seem awfully nervous
tonight.\\
300 - Me, nervous?\\
301 - Why, I was never calmer in my life.\\
302 - Thank you.\\
303 - Are you sure there's nothing wrong?\\
304 - No, of course not, dear.\\
305 - I'll get it.\\
306 - Hello?\\
307 - No, I'm sorry, you have the wrong
number.\\
308 - Lucy, I never seen you act so
jittery.\\
309 - Are you sure everything's all right?\\
310 - Of course, dear.\\
311 - Well, why don't you do something?\\
312 - Yeah, I'll do something.\\
313 - You haven't finished those...\\
314 - You haven't finished those socks for
me yet.\\
315 - Oh.\\
316 - Why don't you knit for a while?\\
317 - Yeah, that's what I wanted to do.\\
318 - Yes?\\
319 - Madame, can you spare a bit of
sustenance\\
320 - for a deserving human who has met
with a terrible accident?\\
321 - No!\\
322 - Any odd jobs for an honest,
able-bodied man?\\
323 - No, and we don't allow bums in this
building.\\
324 - Bums!\\
325 - I think it only fair to warn you,
Madame,\\
326 - that you are laying yourself open\\
327 - for a libel suit.\\
328 - You get out of here, you
good-for-nothing tramp, or I'll call
the police.\\
329 - Aha! I thought you'd change your
tune.\\
330 - Change my tune...\\
331 - Well, it'll do you no good.\\
332 - I'm leaving.\\
333 - Not up there.\\
334 - The street's that way.\\
335 - What deplorable manners.\\
336 - Lucy.\\
337 - What?!\\
338 - I just want to know\\
339 - how you're coming along with my
socks.\\
340 - Oh, just fine, dear.\\
341 - I'm almost finished, see?\\
342 - I guess I got carried away.\\
343 - I'll get it.\\
344 - Ah, good evening.\\
345 - I wonder...\\
346 - Darling, after all these years\\
347 - you've come back.\\
348 - I have?\\
349 - Yes, it's so good to see you.\\
350 - Well, it's good to see you, too.\\
351 - I, um...\\
352 - I beg your pardon.\\
353 - Oh, no, don't go.\\
354 - I want you to meet Ricky.\\
355 - Ricky, I don't know exactly how to
say this,\\
356 - but I want you to meet my first
husband.\\
357 - How do you...\\
358 - Your first what?\\
359 - Husband.\\
360 - Husband?\\
361 - What kind of...\\
362 - Now, Ricky, Ricky, don't get excited.\\
363 - Let's all sit down\\
364 - and talk about this calmly.\\
365 - Yes, let's all sit down.\\
366 - Sit down, Ricky.\\
367 - I don't feel like sitting down.\\
368 - Now, listen, you,\\
369 - what kind of a gag is this?\\
370 - Well, it's really nothing, dear.\\
371 - Nothing?\\
372 - Well, it's just that a long time
ago--\\
373 - before I met you-- I was friends
with...\\
374 - You were not friends.
You were married.\\
375 - Yeah, just a little bit.\\
376 - A little bit?\\
377 - Well, all right, I was married to...\\
378 - Harold.
Sam.\\
379 - Sam.
Harold.\\
380 - All right, all right, so you were
married\\
381 - to Harold, Sam, Julius or whichever
his name is.\\
382 - Julius!?\\
383 - You stay out of this.\\
384 - How long were you married?\\
385 - Well, it was just a matter of weeks.\\
386 - Really, it's not worth talking about,
Ricky.\\
387 - Not worth talking about?\\
388 - Ha!\\
389 - Well, we were married for a very
short time\\
390 - and then Harold had to join the
service\\
391 - and then I learned he was missing in
action.\\
392 - Aw... oh, oh!\\
393 - It was for the battle of the Argonne
Woods.\\
394 - The Kaiser's troops were all about
us,\\
395 - and Blackjack Sherman Pershing put
his hand on my shoulder\\
396 - and said to me, "Sam"--\\
397 - he always called me by my nickname--\\
398 - "Sam," he said, "gather about you..."\\
399 - Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a
minute.\\
400 - Look, the battle of the Argonne Woods\\
401 - was in the first world war.\\
402 - Yes...\\
403 - That was 33 years ago.\\
404 - Ewww...\\
405 - How old were you when you got
married?\\
406 - I-I was very young.\\
407 - Yeah. As a matter of fact, how old
are you now?\\
408 - 65.\\
409 - What do you think, I'm a dope or
something?\\
410 - You couldn't possibly be 65.\\
411 - I couldn't?\\
412 - Of course not, look at you.\\
413 - 55 yes, but not 65.\\
414 - Don't you care what he says, dollface\\
415 - you still look good to me.\\
416 - A tu te calla la boca\\
417 - y no le digas a mi seÃ±ora
"dollface".\\
418 - Ricky, Ricky, now don't get
excited.\\
419 - I was married to Harold, and that's
all there is to it.\\
420 - Well, that's true-- I know it must
come\\
421 - as a horrible and surprising
disclosure...\\
422 - but the children are entitled\\
423 - to their true father.\\
424 - The children?\\
425 - Yes, my little darlings.\\
426 - Where are they?\\
427 - Don't you have them?\\
428 - You've misplaced them again.\\
429 - You always were forgetful,\\
430 - weren't you, uh, uh...?\\
431 - What's her name?\\
432 - Well, I always called her Red.\\
433 - Now, Ricky.\\
434 - You stay out of this.\\
435 - What's her name?\\
436 - Ricky.\\
437 - Lucy, I told you...\\
438 - Ah...\\
439 - the forgetful little Lucy.\\
440 - How well I remember the first time I
heard that lilting name.\\
441 - It seems like yesterday.\\
442 - In fact, it seems like today.\\
443 - Now, look, am I going crazy or
something?\\
444 - Neither one of you is telling the
truth.\\
445 - Now, why would you want me to think\\
446 - that she's married to you in the
first place?\\
447 - Well, uh...\\
448 - Lucy, I want the truth.\\
449 - The truth?\\
450 - Yes, were you or were you not married
to... him?\\
451 - Yes.\\
452 - Well, that does it, I'm packing.\\
453 - Packing?\\
454 - Of course.
If we are not married,\\
455 - you can't expect me to stay here.\\
456 - Besides, you want to be alone with
your husband.\\
457 - But, Ricky...\\
458 - Psst!\\
459 - Did that man from the program get
here?\\
460 - Yeah, he's here.\\
461 - I don't want to take up any of your
time.\\
462 - I just wanted to find how you were
making out.\\
463 - Okay.
Can I take a peek at him?\\
464 - Yeah, go ahead.\\
465 - What's that bum doing in there?\\
466 - What bum?\\
467 - That tramp-- he was down at my door\\
468 - not ten minutes ago asking for a
handout.\\
469 - He's not the man from the program.\\
470 - Oh!\\
471 - Take your hand out of that drawer.\\
472 - The honeymoon is over.\\
473 - What do you mean going on up those
stairs\\
474 - when I told you the street was the
other way?\\
475 - Good-bye, Lucy.\\
476 - Good-bye, Ricky.\\
477 - Wait a minute, come back here.\\
478 - Now, now, now, I resent this
intrusion upon my person.\\
479 - Those are my life's savings you're
taking from me.\\
480 - On your way.\\
481 - There is no need seeing me to the
door.\\
482 - Mother told me to expect days like
this.\\
483 - Get out!\\
484 - The nerve of some bums.\\
485 - Now, Mrs. Ricardo, if you don't mind,\\
486 - I think that I am entitled\\
487 - to a little bit of an explanation\\
488 - of what is going on here!\\
489 - Oh!\\
490 - Uh... Oh, Ethel, would you excuse us?\\
491 - I have a little explaining to do to
Ricky.\\
492 - You sure have, dear.
Good night.\\
493 - Now, now, Ricky, sit down, dear.\\
494 - Sit down.\\
495 - Wait till you hear.\\
496 - It's so funny and it's so simple.\\
497 - Well, what is it?\\
498 - Well, you know this morning\\
499 - when we had that discussion about
money.\\
500 - Well, Ethel and I...\\
501 - Oh, I'll get it.\\
502 - No, no-- I'll get it.\\
503 - Is this the Ricardo residence?\\
504 - Yes.\\
505 - Darling, don't you recognize me?\\
506 - It's Arnold.\\
507 - Well?\\
508 - Ricky, I want you to meet my second
first husband.\\
509 - Now, Ricky, listen to me.\\
510 - Please listen to me.\\
511 - That's what they asked me to do at
the radio program\\
512 - in order to win that thousand
dollars,\\
513 - and I came home and I tried to do it,\\
514 - and I don't know who that first man
was\\
515 - but I was never married to him\\
516 - and this is the man from the program\\
517 - and he's my real first husband\\
518 - but I was never married to him either\\
519 - and that's the truth, so help me.\\
520 - Now, if you don't believe me, you can
leave.\\
521 - That is the most ridiculous story\\
522 - I've ever heard in my whole life.\\
523 - But it's true, Mr. Ricardo,\\
524 - and your wife didn't start explaining
until after midnight,\\
525 - so she wins the thousand dollars.\\
526 - Congratulations, Mrs. Ricardo,\\
527 - and thanks for a very pleasant
evening.\\
528 - Thank you.\\
529 - Good night.\\
530 - Good night.\\
531 - You give me that, Ricky Ricardo.\\
532 - That belongs to me.\\
533 - Let's see.\\
534 - Rent, $250...\\
535 - grocer, $100...\\
536 - charge account, $575...\\
537 - utilities, $74.50.\\
538 - Well, you got some change coming.\\
539 - Well, I should hope so.\\
540 - There you are.\\
541 - Ricky!
\subsection {Episode 06: The Audition (1951)}
1 - Ricky, time to get up!\\
2 - Ricky, time to get up.\\
3 - Aw, come on, now, honey.\\
4 - You said you had an appointment at
11:00\\
5 - and it's after 10:00.\\
6 - All right, you asked for it.\\
7 - iBabalu!\\
8 - iBabalu!\\
9 - iBabalu-aye!\\
10 - All right, all right, all right, all
right!\\
11 - All right, I'll get up.\\
12 - All right.\\
13 - Ricky!\\
14 - Ricky!\\
15 - Yeah?\\
16 - Did you find out when you're going to
do your TV audition?\\
17 - No, I didn't.\\
18 - You did, too.\\
19 - I did not.\\
20 - It's any day now.\\
21 - They're going to tell me whenever
they're ready.\\
22 - You know, I've been thinking\\
23 - about shows like Burns and Allen.\\
24 - George Burns uses his wife on the
show.\\
25 - Why don't you?\\
26 - I'd love to.\\
27 - You think she would leave George?\\
28 - Oh...\\
29 - Well, I know one thing--\\
30 - you'll never be a success on
television.\\
31 - And what do you mean by that, pray
tell?\\
32 - Because you don't have a pretty girl
in your act, that's why.\\
33 - Here we go again.\\
34 - I'll get along.\\
35 - Everybody knows that you have to have\\
36 - a pretty girl in your act to
demonstrate\\
37 - the sponsor's product.\\
38 - Really?
Sure. She eats it or drinks it\\
39 - or waxes the floor with it or cuts
potatoes with it\\
40 - or drives off in it.\\
41 - Or smokes it.\\
42 - So?\\
43 - So how would you like to have\\
44 - your sponsor's product demonstrated\\
45 - by a gorgeous redhead?\\
46 - I'd love it.\\
47 - Oh, you would?\\
48 - You know where I can find one?\\
49 - Oh!\\
50 - Ay-ay-ay!\\
51 - Now what are you doing?\\
52 - I'm looking for my ear.\\
53 - Oh...\\
54 - You didn't really lose an ear.\\
55 - Eh? How's that?\\
56 - Oh, stop it.\\
57 - Honey, you know how I feel about
this.\\
58 - I don't want my wife in show
business.\\
59 - Why not?\\
60 - Oh, Lucy, we've been over this\\
61 - 10,000 times.\\
62 - I want a wife who's just a wife.\\
63 - Now, all you have to do is clean the
house for me,\\
64 - bring me my slippers when I come home
at night,\\
65 - cook for me and be the mama for my
children.\\
66 - You never wear your slippers.\\
67 - It doesn't matter.\\
68 - Just do the others.\\
69 - You're missing a good bet.\\
70 - Huh?\\
71 - I say, you're missing a good bet.\\
72 - Am I?\\
73 - Yeah.\\
74 - How you figure?\\
75 - Because I can sing.\\
76 - Oh?\\
77 - And dance.\\
78 - What else?\\
79 - And tell jokes.\\
80 - How about it?\\
81 - No.\\
82 - No?\\
83 - No.\\
84 - Oh, you have no imagination.\\
85 - I'll bet if Ziegfeld or Earl Carroll
had seen me,\\
86 - they'd sign me up like that.\\
87 - As what?\\
88 - As a beautiful show girl.\\
89 - Go answer the door.\\
90 - Oh!\\
91 - Oh.\\
92 - Hey, Rick, have I got news for you!\\
93 - Tonight's the night.\\
94 - Your audition's tonight.\\
95 - Shh! I don't want Lucy to hear.\\
96 - Oh. Oh, well, the network big shots
are coming down\\
97 - to the club tonight to audition your
show for TV.\\
98 - How do you know?\\
99 - Well, read this telegram.\\
100 - I opened it by mistake.\\
101 - Oh, here's some mail for you.\\
102 - "Dear Mr. Ricardo, we're coming down
to the Tropicana\\
103 - to catch your show tonight."\\
104 - Oh, Fred, that's wonderful!\\
105 - For goodness' sakes, don't tell Lucy,
will you?\\
106 - If she knows the audition is tonight\\
107 - she'll be pestering the life out of
me\\
108 - trying to get into the act.\\
109 - How am I going to get rid of her for
the day?\\
110 - Well, you could lock her in the
bathroom.\\
111 - If she stays in there as long as
Ethel does\\
112 - she'd never even know the door's
locked.\\
113 - No, Fred, I can't do that.\\
114 - Let's see what we got in here.\\
115 - Boy, what is this?\\
116 - What is all that stuff?\\
117 - Oh, it's our wills.\\
118 - The attorney wants us to sign them.\\
119 - Wills? Oh, that's a happy thought.\\
120 - Listen, if my show is not a success
tonight,\\
121 - I'm going to need them.\\
122 - Well, I wish I could help you.\\
123 - I wish you could figure\\
124 - a way to get rid of Lucy.\\
125 - Yeah?
Hey, I know.\\
126 - I'll have her take these things down
to the attorney.\\
127 - His office is way downtown.\\
128 - Well, that ought to do it.\\
129 - Now-Now-Now, listen,\\
130 - can I come and hear the rehearsal
tonight?\\
131 - Sure.\\
132 - Remember now-- tonight's the night.
Knock 'em dead!\\
133 - Shh!\\
134 - Shh!\\
135 - Da, da, da, da, da, da\\
136 - Da-da, da-da-da-da\\
137 - Da-da-da-da...\\
138 - Lucy...\\
139 - Yes?\\
140 - No.\\
141 - Oh, Ricky!\\
142 - Don't you want to know\\
143 - who was at the door?\\
144 - Who was it? Your agent?\\
145 - Does he know when the TV audition is?\\
146 - What'd he say?
What'd he say?\\
147 - No, it wasn't my agent; it was the
mailman.\\
148 - Oh.
He brought some papers for us to sign\\
149 - and we got to take them down to the
attorney's.\\
150 - It's my will.\\
151 - Well, I'll get your breakfast.\\
152 - Your will?!\\
153 - Yes.\\
154 - What's the matter, Ricky?\\
155 - Nothing is the matter.\\
156 - There is, too.\\
157 - You're keeping something from me.\\
158 - You're sick!\\
159 - I never felt better in my whole life.\\
160 - Then you lied to me when we were
married.\\
161 - You're really older than I think.\\
162 - Now, look, honey, it's just good
business.\\
163 - The lawyer says I should have a will.\\
164 - Then everything is legally taken care
of\\
165 - if anything happens.\\
166 - I won't discuss it.\\
167 - Oh, look, honey,\\
168 - you have to know how things are
arranged\\
169 - so you know what to do when I, uh...\\
170 - when I go.\\
171 - Oh, all right, Ricky.\\
172 - That's better.\\
173 - Now what's the matter?\\
174 - Oh, Ricky, I miss you so.\\
175 - For goodness' sakes, Lucy\\
176 - I haven't gone yet.\\
177 - Don't go, Ricky, don't go.\\
178 - Now, look, honey, I'm perfectly well.\\
179 - I feel fine.\\
180 - But let's face it.\\
181 - We all have to go sometime.\\
182 - We do?\\
183 - We do, unless you know something the
rest of us don't.\\
184 - No, I "dunt."\\
185 - I'll get your breakfast.\\
186 - All right, honey.\\
187 - He brought your will along, too.\\
188 - My will?\\
189 - Yeah.\\
190 - What for?\\
191 - You're the one that's going.\\
192 - Now, Lucy...\\
193 - What are you trying to do--\\
194 - shove me ahead of you in line?\\
195 - Now, look, honey,\\
196 - this isn't my idea-- it's lawyer's.\\
197 - We got to get them signed, and you
got to take them\\
198 - down to the attorney's today.\\
199 - Impossible.\\
200 - I have an appointment\\
201 - to have my hair dyed-- washed.\\
202 - They got to go today.\\
203 - Now, come on.\\
204 - Oh, Ricky, the attorney's way
downtown.\\
205 - It'll take me all day.\\
206 - Yeah, I know.\\
207 - Oh, can't they wait?\\
208 - Absolutely not.\\
209 - Well, why not?\\
210 - Well... Well, suppose you didn't take
them down\\
211 - till tomorrow.\\
212 - Yes?\\
213 - And we both got killed today.\\
214 - Yes?\\
215 - How could you take them down
tomorrow?\\
216 - Oh, yeah, that's right.\\
217 - Ole, ole, ole, ole...\\
218 - Ole, ole, ole, ole...\\
219 - Ah, ah, ah, ah...\\
220 - Ah, ah, ah, ah...\\
221 - All right, all right, fellows.\\
222 - That's pretty bad, you know.\\
223 - If you're going to sing, don't go:\\
224 - Ah, ah, ah, ah.\\
225 - Ah, ah, ah, ah!\\
226 - Let's put some pep into the thing.\\
227 - What's the use of having a rehearsal\\
228 - if we're not going to do it right?\\
229 - Buffo, aren't you ready yet?\\
230 - I'm ready.\\
231 - Go ahead with my music.\\
232 - All right, give me the clown music,
fellows.\\
233 - All right, wait, wait, wait a minute.\\
234 - Listen, aren't you going to do\\
235 - the cello bit first?\\
236 - No, I'm going to do the handstand\\
237 - on the handlebars.\\
238 - Oh, okay.\\
239 - Buffo!\\
240 - What happened there?\\
241 - Hey, buffo!\\
242 - What happened, kid?\\
243 - The brakes locked.\\
244 - The brakes locked?\\
245 - Oh, my goodness.
Sit down here.\\
246 - Are you all right?\\
247 - I don't know.\\
248 - He ought to lie down for a little
while.\\
249 - I'd better go home.\\
250 - And I'll go with him.\\
251 - Where do you live?\\
252 - Staten island.\\
253 - Look, you don't have to take him all
the way home.\\
254 - Why don't you take him to my
apartment, Fred.\\
255 - There's nobody there.\\
256 - All right, come on, Buffo.\\
257 - I'd better get the bicycle.\\
258 - I want to see if it's all right.\\
259 - Never mind the bike.\\
260 - I'll mind that.\\
261 - You take care of yourself.\\
262 - Don't worry about tonight.\\
263 - I'll be okay.\\
264 - All right, give me seventh in the
books.\\
265 - Everybody on the downbeat.\\
266 - Ay-ay-ay!\\
267 - What kind of a start is that,
fellows?\\
268 - It's me-- Buffo.\\
269 - It's Buffo!\\
270 - Buffo, you scared me to death.\\
271 - What are you doing here?\\
272 - I got hurt at rehearsal this
afternoon,\\
273 - and Ricky said I could come over here\\
274 - and lie down for a while.\\
275 - Oh... what rehearsal?\\
276 - Are they getting ready for that TV
audition?\\
277 - Sure, the show's tonight.\\
278 - Tonight? Why, that big bum.\\
279 - So that's why he sent me on a wild
goose chase--\\
280 - just to get rid of me.\\
281 - Well, are you all right, Buffo?\\
282 - Will you be able to do the show
tonight?\\
283 - Well, I guess I can, if the bicycle
works.\\
284 - The brakes locked.\\
285 - Oh.
I'll take a look at it.\\
286 - Oh, you got it here.\\
287 - Yeah.\\
288 - How is it?\\
289 - Seems all right.\\
290 - Wait till I try it, huh?\\
291 - Oh!\\
292 - Oh!\\
293 - Here.\\
294 - Buffo, are you badly hurt?\\
295 - Oh, you'd better tell Ricky to get
somebody else.\\
296 - But who?\\
297 - I don't care.\\
298 - Why don't you take my place?\\
299 - Me?\\
300 - Oh, don't be ridic...\\
301 - Yo quiero pedir que mi negra me
quiera\\
302 - Que tenga dinero y que no se muera\\
303 - Yo le quiero pedir\\
304 - A babalu\\
305 - Una alegra mona como tu\\
306 - Que no tenga otro negro para que no
se muera.\\

330 - Yeah!\\
331 - Hey!\\
332 - Isn't Buffo here yet?\\
333 - No sign of him anywhere.\\
334 - Oh, that's a fine thing.\\
335 - Look at that, the sponsors are here.\\
336 - What am I going to do?\\
337 - They don't look too happy.\\
338 - Are you kidding?\\
339 - For them, that's hilarious.\\
340 - Well, I'll just have to wrap up the
show.\\
341 - That's all I can do.\\
342 - Ladies and gentlemen,\\
343 - we thank you very much for being such
a wonderful audience\\
344 - but we'll have to conclude the show
because...\\
345 - Have you seen a fellow named "Risky
Riscardo"?\\
346 - I'm looking for a fel...\\
347 - I'm looking for a feller named...\\
348 - Who are you looking for?\\
349 - Who are you looking for?\\
350 - I'm looking for a feller named Risky
Riscardo.\\
351 - Well, I'm Ricky Ricardo.\\
352 - Oh, well, pleased to meet you.\\
353 - Pleased to meet you.\\
354 - Do you know where I'd find Risky
Riscardo?\\
355 - Now, look, clown\\
356 - we're doing a show here, you know.\\
357 - Oh, I know, I know, yeah.\\
358 - Well, what do you want?\\
359 - I want to be in the band.\\
360 - Oh, you're a musician.\\
361 - I am?\\
362 - Oh, I am, I am, yeah.\\
363 - Where do I sit?\\
364 - Hey, wait!\\
365 - Come back here!\\
366 - Now, look, come back here.\\
367 - Wait a minute.\\
368 - What do you think you can do?\\
369 - You think you can just walk up here\\
370 - and start working with a band\\
371 - just like that?\\
372 - Just like that?\\
373 - What do you think this is?\\
374 - First of all, I'll have to see your
credentials.\\
375 - Listen, tell me something,
professor--\\
376 - have you had any experience?\\
377 - Come over here, please.
Professor,\\
378 - come right over here.\\
379 - Look, tell me something, do you play
that thing?\\
380 - How's that?\\
381 - I said, "Do you play that thin'?"\\
382 - What "thin"?\\
383 - Never mind making fun of my English.\\
384 - That's English?\\
385 - Do you play that instrument?\\
386 - Where?\\
387 - Over there.\\
388 - Where?
There.\\
389 - Where?
Right there.\\
390 - Oh, there!\\
391 - Do you play it?\\
392 - Well...\\
393 - Yeah.\\
394 - Well, I tell you what we'll do--\\
395 - we'll give you an audition.\\
396 - Huh?\\
397 - We'll listen to you.\\
398 - Play something for us.\\
399 - No!
That's right.\\
400 - Now?
Right now.\\
401 - Oh, my, will you help me?\\
402 - I'll help you out, sure.\\
403 - Thank you.\\
404 - You're welcome.\\
405 - Well, here you are, professor.\\
406 - Gracias.\\
407 - Gracias to you, too.\\

417 - All right, all right.\\
418 - We'll go with the professor.\\
419 - On the downbeat, professor, we'll go

420 - Anytime you're ready, professor,
we'll go with you.\\
421 - Yeah, boy!\\
422 - Look, professor, professor!\\
423 - Come over here, will you, please?\\
424 - Look, professor, I'm sorry\\
425 - but I haven't got any use for a
cellist.\\
426 - No!\\
427 - No. I'll tell you what, though--\\
428 - we have a brand- new instrument...\\
429 - Oh?\\
430 - And I've been looking for someone who
can play it.\\
431 - Oh.\\
432 - And if you can play it...\\
433 - Eh?\\
434 - You've got yourself a job.\\
435 - Oh...\\
436 - Eh?... oh.\\
437 - Eh?... oh.\\
438 - You want to try it?\\
439 - Well, what is it?\\
440 - It's a saxovibatronophonavich.\\
441 - Oh, a saxovibatronophonavich.\\
442 - That's right. You think you can play
it?\\
443 - Oh, sure, sure.\\
444 - Well, wonderful.\\
445 - Bring it out here!\\
446 - The professor can play it.\\
447 - We found someone who can play it.\\
448 - Bring it out here.\\
449 - Professor, we'll take care of the
cello for you.\\
450 - It's a saxovibatronophonavich.\\
451 - It's a saxovibatronophonavich.\\
452 - It's a saxovibatronophonavich.\\
453 - It's a saxovibatronophonavich...\\
454 - Professor!\\
455 - Right over here, please.\\
456 - Now, look, professor--\\
457 - all you got to do is give us a tune,\\
458 - and you got yourself a job.
Right.\\
459 - All right?
Right.\\
460 - Go to it.
Right.\\
461 - That's it right there, professor.\\
462 - Go ahead, go ahead.\\
463 - Give us a tune.\\
464 - Hey, professor!
Professor!\\
465 - Ricky...\\
466 - Ricky, where you been?\\
467 - It's after 3:00.\\
468 - Oh, Ricky, talk to me.\\
469 - Oh, I was only trying to help--
honest.\\
470 - I never dreamed they'd offer me a
contract.\\
471 - What are you going to do about it?\\
472 - What do you want me to do, Ricky?\\
473 - You know what I want.\\
474 - I just want you to clean the house...\\
475 - Oh, I've been doing that\\
476 - ever since I got home.\\
477 - And hand me my slippers\\
478 - when I come home at night...\\
479 - And cook for you\\
480 - and be the mama for your children.\\
481 - Let's see you pull that out of your
pocket.\\
482 - Well, Ricky, that's what I wanted\\
483 - to talk to you about.\\
484 - I have a surprise for you.\\
485 - You do?\\
486 - Yes-- something that should make you
very happy.\\
487 - Lucy, you mean...\\
488 - Yes, darling.\\
489 - Oh, gosh.\\
490 - I baked your favorite pie.
\subsection {Episode 07: The Seance (1951)}
1 - Good morning, dear.\\
2 - Uh, what cooks with the breakfast?\\
3 - Yes, dear.\\
4 - Oh, breakfast, yeah.\\
5 - Oh, oh.\\
6 - What's so interesting?\\
7 - Numerology, it's just fascinating.\\
8 - Oh, no, what happened to reading
palms\\
9 - tea leaves and horoscopes?\\
10 - Nothing, only this is so much better
than any of them.\\
11 - Oh, it's a lot of nonsense.\\
12 - It is not. Now you read that book and
see for yourself, Five.\\
13 - Five?\\
14 - Yeah, that's your name in
numerology-- I figured it out.\\
15 - Oh, no.\\
16 - Drink your two before it gets cold.\\
17 - Now, wait a minute, before this thing
gets out of hand\\
18 - I think I better nip it in the three.\\
19 - Watch your language!\\
20 - Now look, honey, you're a grown woman\\
21 - and this is the 20th century.\\
22 - Why don't you forget\\
23 - all these superstitions and crazy
ideas?\\
24 - They are not crazy ideas.\\
25 - For all you know, Ricky Ricardo,\\
26 - you might be going through life\\
27 - with the wrong name.\\
28 - Hey, I better figure out the right
one for you.\\
29 - Maybe if you're something besides
five,\\
30 - it'll help our vibrations.\\
31 - Lucy.\\
32 - What?\\
33 - Don't you like the way I vibrate?\\
34 - Oh, now you be quiet\\
35 - and let me figure this out.\\
36 - Let's see now, two and three are five
and "C" is six.\\
37 - Now we need four and "O" is two.\\
38 - There you are.\\
39 - That's the perfect name.\\
40 - Uh-oh.\\
41 - What is it?\\
42 - Genevieve.\\
43 - That'd be interesting.\\
44 - Of course, you'll have to buy towels
marked "hers" and "hers."\\
45 - Look, I got a wonderful idea.\\
46 - Why don't you just call me Ricky
Ricardo\\
47 - and forget all the numerology
nonsense?\\
48 - Uh-oh, you dropped some silverware.\\
49 - That means company is coming.\\
50 - And it's a fork. That means it's
going to be a woman.\\
51 - Oh, and my palm itches.\\
52 - You know what that means, don't you?\\
53 - The woman is wearing woolen
underwear?\\
54 - No.\\
55 - You didn't take a shower this
morning?\\
56 - No, it means I'm going to get some
money.\\
57 - Ha!\\
58 - Now, you just watch-- a woman is
going to come\\
59 - to the door today and give me some
money.\\
60 - I tell you what, my witch doctor
friend--\\
61 - I'll make a deal with you.\\
62 - What?\\
63 - If a woman comes to the house\\
64 - and gives you some money\\
65 - I will give you ten bucks.\\
66 - Oh, you're a doll.\\
67 - Thank you.\\
68 - But...\\
69 - Oh, but.\\
70 - Yes, but...\\
71 - if this loaded female does not
appear, eh?\\
72 - You will forget all about these
horoscopes,\\
73 - numerology and superstition\\
74 - and all the rest of the nonsense, all
right?\\
75 - It's a deal.\\
76 - It's a deal.\\
77 - Good morning, Lucy.\\
78 - She's a woman.\\
79 - I guess so.\\
80 - Well, thanks.\\
81 - Now that that's settled, how are you,
Three?\\
82 - I'm fine, Seven.\\
83 - Oh.\\
84 - Five got out on the wrong side of the
bed this morning.\\
85 - Here's the mail.\\
86 - Mr. Six just brought it.\\
87 - Oh, thank you.\\
88 - And here's the dollar I borrowed from
you yesterday.\\
89 - Thank you.\\
90 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
91 - I better leave for rehearsal\\
92 - before I lose my sanity.\\
93 - Good-bye, Three.\\
94 - Good-bye, Five.\\
95 - Why do you have that idiotic smile on
your face?\\
96 - I was just thinking of a perfect 16 I
used to know.\\
97 - Oh, get out of here.\\
98 - Hey, by the way, my barber is going
to call this morning\\
99 - to see if I can make it\\
100 - this afternoon for a haircut.\\
101 - Tell him yes.\\
102 - Oh, wait a minute now, wait a minute.\\
103 - I want to look up your horoscope.\\
104 - This might not be a good day\\
105 - for you to have a haircut.\\
106 - Good-bye, Lucy.\\
107 - Wait a minute, here it is-- Gemini,
Gemini.\\
108 - "This is your big day.\\
109 - Everything you do today will turn out
well."\\
110 - Okay, Ricky, it's all right for you
to get a haircut.\\
111 - Well, I don't know.\\
112 - I'm worried.\\
113 - About what?\\
114 - You'd better look up the barber\\
115 - and see if it's a good day for him to
give me a haircut.\\
116 - Oh...\\
117 - Now you go on.\\
118 - You feel free to say yes\\
119 - to everything today no matter what it
is.\\
120 - Oh, boy, will I!\\
121 - Let's see what my horoscope is.\\
122 - What are you, Ethel?\\
123 - I'm Leo.\\
124 - And the old lion sure is in a rut.\\
125 - It says exactly the same thing it
said yesterday.\\
126 - Really?
Yeah.\\
127 - Matter of fact, this is yesterday's
paper.\\
128 - What?\\
129 - Mm-hmm. See?\\
130 - Oh, no, and I told Ricky\\
131 - to say yes to everything today\\
132 - and this may be his "no" day.\\
133 - What did I do with today's paper?\\
134 - Oh, no.\\
135 - Oh.\\
136 - I got to find that horoscope.\\
137 - Here it is-- Gemini, Gemini, Gemini.\\
138 - What does it say?\\
139 - "This is not your day.\\
140 - "Danger lurks everywhere.\\
141 - "Climb in a hole and pull the hole in
after you.\\
142 - Don't agree to anything."\\
143 - Oh, my goodness.\\
144 - Oh, poor Ricky.\\
145 - Out with a "yes" on his lips on a
"no" day.\\
146 - He shouldn't even go to the barber.\\
147 - He might lose an ear or something.\\
148 - That must be the barber.\\
149 - Hello.\\
150 - No, the answer is no.\\
151 - Look, Ricky told me you were going to
call\\
152 - and the answer is no-- N-O.\\
153 - See here, what is your name?\\
154 - Merriweather?
Well, listen, Merriweather,\\
155 - I'm going to recommend to Mr. Ricardo\\
156 - that he have nothing more to do with
you.\\
157 - One of his sideburns is always higher\\
158 - than the other anyway.
Good-bye.\\
159 - That takes care of Merriweather.\\
160 - You sure saved Ricky from that.\\
161 - I better call him at the club and
tell him to come home and hide.\\
162 - I got to go.\\
163 - So long, Three.\\
164 - Good-bye, Seven.\\
165 - Lucy!\\
166 - Oh, honey, am I glad you came
back!\\
167 - I was reading the wrong newspaper.\\
168 - This is one of your bad, bad days of
all time.\\
169 - You can't talk to anybody\\
170 - or transact any business.\\
171 - You better get in bed\\
172 - and pull the covers over your head.\\
173 - I think I'm reasonably safe sitting
here.\\
174 - Well, honey, I don't know.\\
175 - Did anybody call?\\
176 - Just the barber-- I told him no.\\
177 - Nobody else?
No.\\
178 - Well, good. I came back because I
remember I'm expecting\\
179 - a very important phone call here this
morning.\\
180 - What about?\\
181 - I don't want to talk about it.\\
182 - It's bad luck to talk about a big
deal before it's set.\\
183 - Just keep your fingers crossed.\\
184 - Well, if it's that big, I'll do
better than that.\\
185 - Aren't you overdoing it a little?\\
186 - I'm not finished yet.\\
187 - Well, that should keep the bad
spirits away.\\
188 - Now, go in the kitchen and do your
dishes\\
189 - and don't think about it anymore.\\
190 - The call should come through any
minute.\\
191 - Well, I'm not gonna uncross anything.\\
192 - You sure nobody called?\\
193 - Just the barber.\\
194 - Well, that's good, because I want to
make sure\\
195 - to talk to Mr. Merriweather
personally.\\
196 - What's the matter?\\
197 - Ricky, what's your barber's name?\\
198 - Nick.\\
199 - Nick what?\\
200 - Vascalupas.\\
201 - Just as a matter of idle curiosity\\
202 - who's Mr. Merriweather?\\
203 - Well, I guess there's no harm in
telling you.\\
204 - He's one of the biggest theatrical
producers in town\\
205 - and he's going to call me here this
morning\\
206 - and offer me a job in one of his next
shows.\\
207 - Isn't that wonderful?\\
208 - Oh, yeah, wonderful.\\
209 - Ah, honey, if this thing comes
through,\\
210 - all our worries are over.\\
211 - You can have anything that you ever
dreamed about.\\
212 - I'm going to buy you\\
213 - the biggest diamond ring in town.\\
214 - Diamond ring?\\
215 - Yes, and I'm going to buy you a
full-length mink coat.\\
216 - A mink coat?\\
217 - And the longest, shiniest Cadillac\\
218 - in the whole world.\\
219 - Lucy, is there something wrong?\\
220 - Oh, Ricky, I've done a terrible
thing.\\
221 - But before I tell you, is there any
chance\\
222 - that Vascalupas has changed his name
to Merriweather?\\
223 - Lucy...\\
224 - Lucy?\\
225 - What have you done?\\
226 - Lucy, what have you done?\\
227 - Stand still and I'll tell you.\\
228 - Well?\\
229 - Well, Mr. Merriweather called\\
230 - and I thought it was the barber and I
told him no.\\
231 - What?!\\
232 - I was only trying to help!\\
233 - Help?!\\
234 - Help!\\
235 - I'll call him and explain.\\
236 - You'll do better than that.\\
237 - You're going to go down there in
person\\
238 - on your knees.
Come on.\\
239 - Oh, won't we get there faster if we
take a cab?\\
240 - Come on.\\
241 - Tillie.\\
242 - Tillie.\\
243 - Tillie, if you can hear me, answer on
the Ouija board.\\
244 - Yes?\\
245 - Oh, send them in.\\
246 - Hello, Mr. Ricardo.\\
247 - Hello, Mr. Merriweather.\\
248 - This is my wife, Lucy.\\
249 - She has something to tell you.\\
250 - Oh, how charming.\\
251 - Mr. Merriweather, it was a big
mistake\\
252 - saying no to you today.\\
253 - You see, I thought...\\
254 - Oh, wait, please, please.\\
255 - I can't discuss any more business
today.\\
256 - It's after 12:00.\\
257 - After 12:00?\\
258 - Yes, my horoscope says no more
business after noon today.\\
259 - Oh, you follow horoscopes?\\
260 - Yes.
I'm Scorpio.\\
261 - Oh, I'm Taurus.\\
262 - I'm cooked.\\
263 - Well, won't you, won't you sit down?\\
264 - Yes.\\
265 - You see, you see, Mr. Merriweather,\\
266 - the reason that I said no\\
267 - was because Ricky's horoscope said\\
268 - that it was a very bad day for him to
accept anything.\\
269 - Oh, yes, I understand perfectly.\\
270 - Well, Mr. Merriweather, if you
understand,\\
271 - maybe we could discuss about...\\
272 - Oh, Ricky, if the stars say\\
273 - that he can't discuss business,\\
274 - that means he can't discuss it.\\
275 - Now, you see, important people like
Mr. Merriweather\\
276 - are interested in horoscopes,
numerology and all of that.\\
277 - Oh, you study numerology?\\
278 - Of course.\\
279 - I'm a one.\\
280 - I'm a three.\\
281 - I'm a five.\\
282 - We're all odd, aren't we?\\
283 - Do you Ouija?\\
284 - How's that?\\
285 - Do you Ouija?\\
286 - Well, I'm not sure.\\
287 - I mean, have you had any success\\
288 - with the Ouija board?\\
289 - Oh, Ouija board!\\
290 - Oh, no, I haven't gotten around to
that yet.\\
291 - Oh, too bad-- I've worn out three of
them\\
292 - trying to contact my dear, departed
Tillie\\
293 - who left me three years ago.\\
294 - Oh, I understand.\\
295 - I wish I could find a good sÃ©ance.\\
296 - You wouldn't happen to know\\
297 - where they're having one\\
298 - Mrs. Ricardo, would you?\\
299 - Well, now, it just happens\\
300 - that we're having a sÃ©ance at our
house tonight.\\
301 - We are?\\
302 - Oh, we are, we are.\\
303 - And we'd love to have you come.\\
304 - We just happen to have a vacant
chair.\\
305 - Oh, I just can't wait.\\
306 - Who knows? I may even get to talk to
Tillie tonight.\\
307 - Lucy, this is just plain silly.\\
308 - If Mr. Merriweather finds out\\
309 - that we're doing this just for him,\\
310 - he'll never give me a job.\\
311 - Oh, honey, he won't find out.\\
312 - Now, Ethel will be the medium\\
313 - and you and I and Fred will just it
here hold hands.\\
314 - Well, what good would that do?\\
315 - Well, now, you never can tell.\\
316 - Before the evening is over, we may
see a spook.\\
317 - Don't tell me you invited your
mother.\\
318 - Well!\\
319 - Introducing Rhea, the medium.\\
320 - Well done, medium Rhea.\\
321 - Ethel, you look sensational.\\
322 - That's a wonderful getup.\\
323 - Isn't it?\\
324 - Fred, what are you doing with this?\\
325 - It's not a Shriners' convention, you
know.\\
326 - Come on, Fred, help me get some ice.\\
327 - All right.\\
328 - Oh, bring the bucket, will you?\\
329 - Ethel, I want to tell you something\\
330 - before the boys come back.\\
331 - What?\\
332 - I have a feeling\\
333 - we're going to contact the other side
tonight.\\
334 - Yeah? What makes you think so?\\
335 - Shake hands with Tillie Merriweather.\\
336 - Huh?\\
337 - Ricky will kill me if he knows what
I'm planning,\\
338 - but after everybody gets seated,\\
339 - I'm going to sneak away from the
circle\\
340 - and I'm going to be the voice of
Tillie.\\
341 - Where will you be?\\
342 - Well, I'll be right over there behind
you, near the fireplace.\\
343 - Help me with the chairs.\\
344 - Listen, Fred, Lucy will kill me\\
345 - for even thinking about this,\\
346 - but as long as we're going to go
through with the sÃ©ance,\\
347 - Mr. Merriweather might as well really
contact his wife.\\
348 - Yeah.\\
349 - Now, would you care to help me,\\
350 - Mrs. Merriweather?\\
351 - I think you've snapped your twig,
son.\\
352 - Now look, Fred, it's very simple.\\
353 - All you have to do is pretend\\
354 - that you have a headache\\
355 - and that you want to go downstairs to
bed, see?\\
356 - Then, as soon as the sÃ©ance gets
going,\\
357 - I'll stamp my foot twice, you sneak
up,\\
358 - and pretend to be the voice of Mrs.
Merriweather.\\
359 - Now, do you think you can sound like
a female spirit?\\
360 - Well, I don't know,\\
361 - but I can certainly try, dear old
boy.\\
362 - Good girl.\\
363 - I mean, uh...
I meant, good boy.\\
364 - Now listen, Fred,\\
365 - don't be too obvious about the
headache.\\
366 - We don't want them to suspect
anything.\\
367 - Don't ham it up.\\
368 - Fred, is something wrong?\\
369 - It's my head.\\
370 - Oh.\\
371 - Aren't we going to have fun\\
372 - at this sÃ©ance?\\
373 - Well, I guess so.\\
374 - You look seriously ill to me.\\
375 - Oh, if it's his head, he's all right.\\
376 - There's nothing up there to hurt.\\
377 - Why, you cruel, heartless woman.\\
378 - Speaking to a sick man like this\\
379 - without any sympathy.\\
380 - Fred, you better go to bed
downstairs.\\
381 - Go to bed, Fred.\\
382 - Oh, good evening, Mr.
Merriweather, come in.\\
383 - Hello, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
384 - Good evening.\\
385 - Oh, good evening, Mr. Merriweather.\\
386 - I'll take your coat and hat.\\
387 - Thank you.\\
388 - Mr. Merriweather, I'd like to present\\
389 - Madame Ethel Mertzola.\\
390 - She's going to be our medium tonight.\\
391 - She's psychopathic.\\
392 - How do you do?\\
393 - Oh, how do you do?\\
394 - Oh, I've been thinking about this all
afternoon.\\
395 - You know, I have a feeling that
tonight\\
396 - I'm going to contact Tillie.\\
397 - So have I.\\
398 - Well, is everybody ready?\\
399 - Yes, I feel real trancey.\\
400 - Good.\\
401 - Uh, you sit here, Mr. Merriweather.\\
402 - Ricky, you're over there, dear.\\
403 - All right.\\
404 - I'll turn out the lights.\\
405 - Okay, I'll move this one over here.\\
406 - All right, Madame.\\
407 - Now, everybody join hands.\\
408 - Now everybody close their eyes\\
409 - and keep them tightly closed.\\
410 - The spirits must not see\\
411 - the whites of your eyes.\\
412 - Close your eyes and concentrate.\\
413 - Oh, excuse me.\\
414 - God bless you.\\
415 - Oh, thank you.\\
416 - I am now going into a trance.\\
417 - I shall try to contact Tillie.\\
418 - The next voice you hear will be the
voice of Tillie.\\
419 - Oh.\\
420 - What's the matter?\\
421 - Um, my foot was asleep.\\
422 - Oh.\\
423 - Is everyone comfortable now?\\
424 - I'm comfortable.\\
425 - Are you, Ricky?\\
426 - Yes, I am. How about you, Lucy?\\
427 - Yes, I'm comfortable.\\
428 - All right, here we go.\\
429 - I shall now contact Tillie.\\
430 - Ethel to Tillie.\\
431 - Ethel to Tillie.\\
432 - Come in, Tillie, over.\\
433 - Tillie.\\
434 - Tillie, is that you?\\
435 - Yes, it's me, Tillie.\\
436 - But Tillie, that sneeze, are you
sick?\\
437 - Sick? I'm dead.\\
438 - Oh, that's right.\\
439 - But wait, if you're a spirit, how can
you have a cold?\\
440 - I went out last night
without my shroud.\\
441 - Oh.\\
442 - Ow!\\
443 - I mean, owww.\\
444 - What's the matter?\\
445 - Oh, I burned myself.\\
446 - It's awfully hot here.\\
447 - Oh, that's where you are!\\
448 - Oh, Tillie, I'm so disappointed in
you.\\
449 - Oh, well, I have to go now.\\
450 - Oh, no, no, no! No, wait, Tillie,
wait.\\
451 - Tillie, I've always wanted to ask you
something.\\
452 - What?\\
453 - Tell me, Tillie--\\
454 - who did you like the best, me or Mrs.
Merriweather?\\
455 - Huh?\\
456 - I said, who did you like the best,\\
457 - me or Mrs. Merriweather?\\
458 - Well, you, of course.\\
459 - Oh, this is the most exciting day in
my life.\\
460 - Tillie liked me the best.\\
461 - Oh, now...
Now, if... if I may,\\
462 - I'd like to try and contact Mrs.
Merriweather.\\
463 - Mrs. Merriweather?\\
464 - Well, all right.\\
465 - Ethel to Mrs.
Merriweather.\\
466 - Ethel to Mrs. Merriweather.\\
467 - Come in, Mrs.
Merriweather.\\
468 - Over.\\
469 - Hello!\\
470 - Is... is that you, my dear?\\
471 - Yes, darling.\\
472 - Darling?\\
473 - That doesn't sound like Adelaide.\\
474 - Shut up, you worm!\\
475 - That's Adelaide!\\
476 - Oh, what terrible memories it brings
back to me.\\
477 - Uh, my trance is wearing off.\\
478 - I think you'd better hang up now.\\
479 - All right, good-bye, Adelaide.\\
480 - Good-bye.\\
481 - Good-bye, Tillie.\\
482 - Good-bye.\\
483 - Well, everybody unclasp hands now.\\
484 - Open your eyes.\\
485 - Well, this has certainly been\\
486 - an eventful evening.\\
487 - Yes.\\
488 - Well, I must dash home immediately\\
489 - and write it in my diary.\\
490 - I'll get your coat, sir.\\
491 - Thank you.
Oh, Mrs. Ricardo,\\
492 - I just can't thank you enough.\\
493 - Well, it's been a pleasure.\\
494 - Good night, Madame Mertzola.\\
495 - Oh, good night.\\
496 - I'll walk you downstairs.\\
497 - Oh, Lucy, you were great.\\
498 - I'd never have known you did those
two voices.\\
499 - I didn't.\\
500 - You didn't?\\
501 - No.\\
502 - Ethel, you underestimate your
transmitter.\\
503 - You really contacted the other side.\\
504 - I did?\\
505 - Yes.\\
506 - Oh, Lucy, I'm frightened.\\
507 - So am I.\\
508 - Hello, Fred.\\
509 - Hello.\\
510 - Yippee!\\
511 - Honey...\\
512 - you got the best horoscopes in town.\\
513 - Well, thank you.\\
514 - You know what he did?
What?\\
515 - Mr. Merriweather gave me an even
better job.\\
516 - He's going to star me in one of his
next shows.\\
517 - Oh, listen, Ricky, I have a
confession to make.\\
518 - I did a terrible thing.\\
519 - I was the voice of Tillie.\\
520 - But that other voice, Mrs.
Merriweather,\\
521 - it was real.\\
522 - It certainly was.\\
523 - Fred Mertz.\\
524 - You were the other voice.\\
525 - Yeah, and I thought Tillie was a real
spook.\\
526 - Oh, no!\\
527 - Wait a minute, wait a minute,\\
528 - there's something else I don't
understand.\\
529 - If Tillie wasn't Mrs.
Merriweather, who was she?\\
530 - Oh, well, um, Mr. Merriweather
explained that to me,\\
531 - and he paid you a great compliment.\\
532 - He said he knew it was the real thing\\
533 - because it sounded exactly like
Tillie\\
534 - if she could talk.\\
535 - Well, that's very flattering.\\
536 - If she could talk?\\
537 - Well, you see\\
538 - Tillie was Mr.
Merriweather's cocker spaniel.\\
539 - Oh, no!
\subsection {Episode 08: Men Are Messy (1951)}
1 - Hello.\\
2 - Oh, hi, Ethel.\\
3 - Oh, just straightening up.\\
4 - You know I can't stand it if the
house isn't neat.\\
5 - A place for everything and everything
in its place.\\
6 - That's the way I like it.\\
7 - Well, Ricky ought to be home any
minute.\\
8 - No, I had dinner.\\
9 - Ricky ate downtown at the club.\\
10 - Gee, I don't know what we're doing
tonight.\\
11 - I'll call you back after Ricky gets
home.\\
12 - Okay, dear.\\
13 - Ah...\\
14 - Ay!\\
15 - Hello, Ricky baby, I...\\
16 - Hi.\\
17 - Well!\\
18 - What's the matter?\\
19 - How could a cyclone hit in here\\
20 - and not hit in the kitchen?\\
21 - What are you talking about, a
cyclone?\\
22 - Well, something hit this room.\\
23 - Where? I don't see anything wrong.\\
24 - Oh, you don't?\\
25 - Would you mind telling me, please,\\
26 - what all these clothes are doing here
in the living room?\\
27 - Oh, that's where I took them off.\\
28 - Would you put them away for me, dear?\\
29 - Look, honey, there's a new invention
you'll just love--\\
30 - it's a hole in the wall, has a long
pole in it,\\
31 - little metal things hanging on it\\
32 - and it's called a coat closet.\\
33 - Well, what won't they think of next?\\
34 - Oh, honestly, Ricky.\\
35 - How can you men be so sloppy and
dirty?\\
36 - You're nothing but a bunch of mess
cats.\\
37 - There's nothing sloppy and dirty
about this room.\\
38 - It just looks, uh, lived in.\\
39 - Well, that's a good answer if you
happen to be a pig.\\
40 - Honey, just drop the subject, will
you?\\
41 - I'd be glad to drop it\\
42 - if there's any more room on the
floor.\\
43 - You can't expect me to live in a
museum.\\
44 - A man's home is his castle, and this
is my castle.\\
45 - Oh, all right, your majesty.\\
46 - I bow to Ricardo the first...\\
47 - king of the slobs.\\
48 - Thank you, my faithful subject.\\
49 - Don't expect this slave to pick up
after you.\\
50 - If you want the house to look like
this, okay,\\
51 - you can just sit and wallow in it.\\
52 - Ay, Lucy, Lucy, Lucy.\\
53 - Well, here's a whole spread on Tommy
Dorsey at home,\\
54 - and you know something?\\
55 - What?\\
56 - He has his shoes on and a tie, too.\\
57 - Yeah? What-what magazine is that?\\
58 - Your musician's magazine, The Half
Beat.\\
59 - It is?\\
60 - Let me see that.\\
61 - Well, how do you like that?\\
62 - My press agent told me\\
63 - I was going to get the next spread.\\
64 - It was going to be "Ricky Ricardo At
Home."\\
65 - What magazine was it going to be in,\\
66 - Better Homes and Garbage?\\
67 - No, smarty, in that magazine.\\
68 - That's a very important magazine\\
69 - in the music business.\\
70 - Wait till I hear from Kenny.\\
71 - Some press agent he is.\\
72 - Hello.\\
73 - Hi, Ethel.\\
74 - Hi, dear.\\
75 - No, I don't think we're doing
anything.\\
76 - Why don't you and Fred come on up.\\
77 - Okay.\\
78 - Ethel and Fred are coming up, honey.\\
79 - Put your shoes on and pick up those
papers.\\
80 - What for?\\
81 - Because company is coming.\\
82 - It isn't company, it's Fred and
Ethel.\\
83 - Well, put your shoes on.\\
84 - They know I have feet.\\
85 - Ricky, are you going to help me\\
86 - clean up this place or aren't you?\\
87 - No, this is my home\\
88 - and I want to be comfortable in it.\\
89 - Your home?\\
90 - What does that make me, a visiting
relative?\\
91 - Oh, honey, I didn't mean it that way.\\
92 - You know, I was under the impression\\
93 - that half of everything in this house
was mine.\\
94 - All right, all right,\\
95 - you go ahead and clean your half of
everything\\
96 - and leave my half just the way it is.\\
97 - All right, we'll divide the room in
half.\\
98 - I'll keep my half the way I want to,\\
99 - you keep your half any way you
please.\\
100 - Are you kidding?\\
101 - No, I'm very serious.\\
102 - Huh.\\
103 - We'll make a line right about here.\\
104 - Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.\\
105 - Esta mujer esta absolutamente loca.\\
106 - Never mind that.\\
107 - Now, honey, wait just a minute.\\
108 - Just stay right over there.\\
109 - That's your line.\\
110 - You can't come over here without a
passport.\\
111 - Oh, for goodness' sakes.\\
112 - Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.\\
113 - That's on the line.\\
114 - I just want a cigarette!\\
115 - Well, half of what's in this pack is
mine.\\
116 - You mean that's the only cigarette we
have in the house?\\
117 - Yep. You get Philip and I get Morris.\\
118 - Stay off my side.\\
119 - Oh, I forgot about the Mertzes.\\
120 - What are these things doing over here\\
121 - on my side?\\
122 - Come in.\\
123 - Hi, Lucy.\\
124 - Hi, folks.
Hi.\\
125 - What's this?\\
126 - Before you settle down, whose side do
you want to sit on?\\
127 - Huh?\\
128 - Over there in the neat side of the
house,\\
129 - or over here with us mess cats?\\
130 - What's going on here?\\
131 - Well, Ricky and I had an argument\\
132 - about his being so messy,\\
133 - so I divided the apartment in two.\\
134 - This is my side, that's Ricky's side.\\
135 - I wondered what happened over there.\\
136 - What's the matter with it?\\
137 - It looks okay to me.\\
138 - Okay?\\
139 - Sure, there's nothing wrong.\\
140 - Just looks lived in.\\
141 - Atta boy, Fred.\\
142 - Would you like to join me\\
143 - in the comfortable part of the house?\\
144 - Delighted.\\
145 - Well, pull up some debris and sit
down, Fred.\\
146 - Don't touch anything on your way over
here.\\
147 - Everything over there is sterilized.\\
148 - Lucy, do you mind if I sit on this
side?\\
149 - No, I think you might find it rather
pleasant over here...\\
150 - until the wind changes.\\
151 - Why don't you take your shoes off,
Fred?\\
152 - Oh, can I do that?\\
153 - Yeah.\\
154 - Oh, gee, thanks.\\
155 - Ah, what a relief.\\
156 - Take your coat off.\\
157 - Well, thanks.\\
158 - Thank you.\\
159 - Here, I'll hang it up for you.\\
160 - Ah.\\
161 - Go ahead.\\
162 - Would you like some fruit?\\
163 - Yeah, I love fruit.\\
164 - All right.\\
165 - Here, Fred, have a banana.\\
166 - Thanks.\\
167 - Good-looking banana.\\
168 - Uh-uh-uh.\\
169 - It's on the line.\\
170 - We have to answer it.\\
171 - We're going to.\\
172 - Hello?\\
173 - Well, go ahead, listen to your half
and see who it is.\\
174 - Oh, it's Kenny, my press agent.\\
175 - Tell him I'm plenty mad at him.\\
176 - Hello, Kenny, Ricky says to tell you
he's plenty mad at you.\\
177 - Why am I mad at you?\\
178 - Why am I mad at you?\\
179 - Huh! Because you've been promising me\\
180 - a spread in Half Beat Note magazine\\
181 - since last February.\\
182 - Splain that if you can.\\
183 - Because you've been promising me\\
184 - a spread in Half Beat magazine\\
185 - since last Febriary.\\
186 - Splain that if you can.\\
187 - Oh.\\
188 - Oh.\\
189 - Oh.\\
190 - I see.\\
191 - I see.\\
192 - They're gonna do the next one on me.\\
193 - Okay. Well, so long, kid, take it
easy.\\
194 - So long, kid, take a tease-y.\\
195 - If I hadn't seen it, I wouldn't
believe it.\\
196 - Well, I saw it and I still don't
believe it.\\
197 - Come on, Fred, you want some cold
beer?\\
198 - Yeah, I'd love it.\\
199 - I think I got some cold chicken\\
200 - in the icebox, too.
Come on.\\
201 - Uh-uh-uh, kitchen's on my side,
remember.\\
202 - You mean I can never go into the
kitchen?\\
203 - And stand back a little, you're over
the line.\\
204 - What am I supposed to do, starve to
death?\\
205 - Oh, I'll toss you a crust of bread
now and then.\\
206 - Hungry, Ethel?\\
207 - Are you kidding?\\
208 - Come on, we'll have some beer and
cold chicken\\
209 - and we'll toss the bottles and bones\\
210 - on Ricky's side.\\
211 - Oh, say, remind me--\\
212 - I want to show you some bath salts
that I got.\\
213 - They were on sale.\\
214 - Oh, show them to me now.
Okay.\\
215 - Uh-uh-uh, may I see your passport?\\
216 - I just want to show Ethel\\
217 - my new bath salts.\\
218 - Well, I'm terribly sorry,\\
219 - but the bathroom is on my side.\\
220 - Do you mean that I can never go\\
221 - into the bathroom?\\
222 - That's right.\\
223 - No more taking a shower,\\
224 - no more washing your face,\\
225 - no more doing whatever it is you do
to your hair.\\
226 - Well, no more food for you.\\
227 - Okay, we'll see who holds out the
longest.\\
228 - Come back in a couple of weeks,
Ethel,\\
229 - we'll still be here--\\
230 - a starving Cuban and a dirty
brunette.\\
231 - Whenever old man trouble makes
trouble arise\\
232 - Just put a big straw hat over your
eyes\\
233 - You'll never see the circumstance
making you...\\
234 - Is this a new number?\\
235 - It is, Maggie.\\
236 - Oh, glory be, I've got to see this.\\
237 - Now, don't do it till I get seated.\\
238 - Okay.\\
239 - You know, you're my best critic.\\
240 - Are you ready?
I am.\\
241 - Whenever old man trouble\\
242 - Makes trouble arise\\
243 - Just put a big straw hat over your
eyes\\
244 - You'll never see the circumstance
making you frown\\
245 - If you just push your eyes under the
crown.\\
246 - Life can be a simple thing\\
247 - A simple thing to laugh and sing\\
248 - Get yourself a hat of straw and put
it on\\
249 - Don't take it off\\
250 - And when the landlord tells you the
rent's in arrears\\
251 - A big straw hat over your ears\\
252 - You'll never hear the dialogue
tragically grim\\
253 - If you just push your ear, mm!
Under the brim.\\
254 - iAgua!\\
255 - iArriba!\\
256 - Yeah!\\
257 - Very good, Maggie.\\
258 - Hey!\\
259 - Hey!\\
260 - Very good!\\
261 - Yeah!\\
262 - Oh... life can be a simple thing\\
263 - A simple thing\\
264 - To laugh and sing\\
265 - Get yourself a hat of straw\\
266 - Put it on...\\
267 - Don't take it off...\\
268 - No.\\
269 - And... pretty soon\\
270 - Your troubles will come to an end\\
271 - Because you will not see\\
272 - Or hear it, my friend\\
273 - To visualize permanent sun in the
skies\\
274 - A big... straw...\\
275 - Hat... down...\\
276 - A big straw hat down over your eyes.\\
277 - Yeah!\\
278 - Well?\\
279 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
280 - Oh, thank you, Maggie, thank you very
much.\\
281 - I'm sure the pleasure was all mine.\\
282 - Oh, that's it.\\
283 - All right, fellows.\\
284 - All right, take ten.\\
285 - Take ten.\\
286 - And I mean ten, not half an hour.\\
287 - Hi, Rick.\\
288 - Hi, Kenny.\\
289 - How is this for fast action?\\
290 - I promised you last night\\
291 - you were going to get the next
magazine spread.\\
292 - Meet the photographer who's going to
shoot it, Jim White.\\
293 - Hello, Jim.\\
294 - Hello, Ricky.\\
295 - I'd like to shoot those pictures
tonight.\\
296 - All right, I think tonight will be
wonderful.\\
297 - You should get very good stuff here
tonight.\\
298 - Yeah, and I'll tell you something
else\\
299 - I'd like to do, Ricky--\\
300 - some pictures of your home life.\\
301 - Oh, sure.\\
302 - What kind of a place have you got?\\
303 - Well, I have a little apartment\\
304 - in a reconverted brownstone.\\
305 - Say, I'd better call the wife and
tell her you're coming.\\
306 - Give her a little warning, eh?\\
307 - Well, to tell you the truth, James,\\
308 - she doesn't need any warning.\\
309 - She's the best little housekeeper you
ever saw.\\
310 - Everything is always as neat as a
pin.\\
311 - Well, we got to go.\\
312 - Jim'll meet you here after rehearsal\\
313 - you can take him out to the house.\\
314 - Okay, I'll see you then.\\
315 - Fine.
Bye.\\
316 - Oh, you don't say, Marge, is that so?\\
317 - Really?\\
318 - Well, it's certainly good\\
319 - to get the other side of the story
for a change.\\
320 - Hey, do you know we've been gabbing
for 45 minutes?\\
321 - Yeah, well, let's get together next
week\\
322 - and have a real talk.\\
323 - Okay, dear, bye.\\
324 - Hi.\\
325 - Oh, hi, Ethel.\\
326 - Welcome to tobacco road.\\
327 - How did Ricky get out of the house
this morning\\
328 - without crossing the line?\\
329 - Through the bedroom window?\\
330 - No, he used the back door.\\
331 - I swapped him kitchen
privileges\\
332 - for bathroom rights.\\
333 - Lucy, how long can this go on?\\
334 - Oh, it's over now.\\
335 - I'm going to clean up\\
336 - the whole house this afternoon.\\
337 - Well, thank goodness.\\
338 - Oh, I forgot what I came up for.\\
339 - Ricky just called me.
Your line was busy.\\
340 - What'd he want?\\
341 - He said to tell you he's bringing\\
342 - a magazine photographer home tonight
to take some pictures,\\
343 - and he wants you to clean up the
house perfectly-- all of it.\\
344 - Oh, he won't keep it clean for me,\\
345 - but when it's important for him,\\
346 - he wants the whole house cleaned up
perfectly-- all of it.\\
347 - Let's face it, he's a man.\\
348 - Serve him right if I left it\\
349 - just the way it is.\\
350 - Yeah.\\
351 - Hey, I'll do it.\\
352 - Oh, Lucy, you wouldn't.\\
353 - Yes, I would.\\
354 - What about that photographer?\\
355 - Oh, that doesn't matter.\\
356 - It's just for that silly musician's
magazine.\\
357 - Nobody ever reads it anyway.\\
358 - And as soon as I make my point\\
359 - I'll tell him it's a gag.\\
360 - And as long as it's a gag, I might as
well go whole hog.\\
361 - Ethel, will you help me?\\
362 - Sure, what do you want me to do?\\
363 - Well, listen, when Ricky comes home
with that photographer,\\
364 - we'll have the whole place...\\
365 - Well, here we are, Jim...\\
366 - What's all this?\\
367 - Is this your apartment?\\
368 - Well, it sure doesn't look anything
like the...\\
369 - Well, what do you know, Jim?\\
370 - We got into the wrong apartment after
all.\\
371 - Let's get out of here.\\
372 - Hi, Ricky honey.\\
373 - Say...\\
374 - Say!\\
375 - What gives here?\\
376 - Do you know who this is?\\
377 - I don't even know what it is.\\
378 - Get me a stick and I'll kill it.\\
379 - Aren't you going to
introduce your bitty, bitty bride?\\
380 - Lucy, I swear...\\
381 - Is this your wife?\\
382 - Why, sure!\\
383 - Yes, Jim.\\
384 - This is my wife.\\
385 - Lucy, meet Jim White.\\
386 - Pleased to meet ya.\\
387 - Whoa! I got an itch.\\
388 - Ah...\\
389 - Lucy...\\
390 - Lucy, whatever you're up to, cut it
out.\\
391 - What's the matter?\\
392 - What's the matter?\\
393 - Look at the way this place looks!\\
394 - Yeah, it looks pretty good, don't it?\\
395 - You should have seen it 'fore I
cleaned it up.\\
396 - It's a regular pigpen!\\
397 - Oh, it ain't a regular one, but it'll
do.\\
398 - You know we don't keep pigs in here--\\
399 - just chickens!\\
400 - Jim, Jim, please, please.\\
401 - Please, Jim, now, look, believe me\\
402 - this place has never looked like this
before in my whole life\\
403 - and... and there isn't a chicken\\
404 - within ten miles of here!\\
405 - Boy, she's flying high tonight, ain't
she!\\
406 - Oh, Lucy, Lucy...\\
407 - Lucy, please, Lucy,\\
408 - come on, let's clean it up.\\
409 - Here, chick, chick, chick, chick,
chick, chick.\\
410 - Honey...\\
411 - honey, do you realize\\
412 - that this man is a very important
photographer?\\
413 - Oh, boy! Take my picture,\\
414 - will ya, sonny?\\
415 - I'd be glad to.\\
416 - Oh, wait a minute, I got to comb my
hair.\\
417 - There we are.\\
418 - Ha-ha!\\
419 - Yeah, boy.\\
420 - Oh, no.\\
421 - Ay!\\
422 - Ah...\\
423 - Oh, my god.\\
424 - Ha, it's messy, ain't it?\\
425 - I got to see if my clothes are dry.\\
426 - Grandma!\\
427 - You been hangin' there all day?\\
428 - Yep.\\
429 - Must have been quite a trip\\
430 - coming through the washing machine.\\
431 - I didn't mind the washing machine,\\
432 - but I durn near passed out comin'
through the wringer.\\
433 - Well, come on, grandma, we're goin'

434 - Gotta bag our supper.\\

442 - A-huntin' we will go...\\
443 - Jim, please believe me--\\
444 - I don't know what's going on here.\\
445 - I've seen her do strange things
before\\
446 - but this time I think she really
snapped her cap.\\
447 - She says she's going hunting.\\
448 - Hunting.
Hunting in the bedroom.\\
449 - How do you like that.\\
450 - That's the most ridiculous thing...\\
451 - What is that?!\\
452 - A-hunting we will go, a-hunting we
will go\\
453 - And a-hunting we will go.\\
454 - Whew!\\
455 - This ought to give your musician
fellers a laugh, huh?\\
456 - What do you mean, musician fellows?\\
457 - Well, who else reads your durn
magazine but musician fellers?\\
458 - Yeah.\\
459 - Lucy...\\
460 - Huh?\\
461 - This man is not from Half Beat
magazine.\\
462 - He ain't?\\
463 - No, I'm from\\
464 - Look magazine.\\
465 - Ewwwww...\\
466 - Hi, Lucy.\\

468 - Look magazine came out today.\\
469 - Oh, did they do the spread on me?\\
470 - How did it look?\\
471 - Oh, it was wonderful for you.\\
472 - They showed the nightclub and the
band\\
473 - and the shots of you singing.\\
474 - Oh, honey, what are you crying about?\\
475 - Jim White promised me\\
476 - he wouldn't use a single picture of
you\\
477 - in the article.\\
478 - No, I wasn't in the article.\\
479 - I made the cover.
\subsection {Episode 09: The Fur Coat (1951)}
1 - Lucy!\\
2 - I'm home!\\
3 - Lucy!\\
4 - Yoo-hoo!\\
5 - Where are you?\\
6 - I'm right here, dear.\\
7 - Lucy, how you've changed!\\
8 - Yes, it's a new way I'm doing my
hair.\\
9 - Where is she, Fred?\\
10 - She's gone to market.\\
11 - Oh, well, I'm glad to see\\
12 - that you're finally fixing that
drain.\\
13 - What do you mean, finally?\\
14 - When was the first time you told me
this drain leaked?\\
15 - The day after we moved here-- August
6, 1948.\\
16 - That's right, and that's pretty good
service for my building.\\
17 - Fred, aren't you finished with that
drain yet?\\
18 - Not quite.\\
19 - Well, come on downstairs-- dinner's
ready.\\
20 - Stop ordering me around, will you?\\
21 - Now, listen, Fred Mertz...\\
22 - Come here.
Come in, Ethel.\\
23 - I want to show you something.\\
24 - Come in here.\\
25 - You, too, curly.\\
26 - All right, all right.\\
27 - Oh, a mink coat!\\
28 - Oh, Ricky, Lucy will just go out of
her mind!\\
29 - I ought to slug you.\\
30 - What are you trying to do--\\
31 - make a bum out of me?\\
32 - Don't blame that on him.\\
33 - You were a bum before he was born.\\
34 - Oh, yeah?\\
35 - Yeah!\\
36 - Hold it, hold it!\\
37 - This coat is not for Lucy.\\
38 - It isn't?\\
39 - No.\\
40 - Saved by the bell.\\
41 - I just rented it.\\
42 - One of the girls is going to wear it\\
43 - in a dance number down at the club.\\
44 - Oh.\\
45 - Well, don't show it to Lucy.\\
46 - You know how she's always wanted a
mink coat.\\
47 - Yeah, I know, but she can't have this
one.\\
48 - You know how much this thing costs?\\
49 - 3,500 bucks.\\
50 - I may faint!\\
51 - Ricky?\\
52 - Yes?\\
53 - Could I play like it's mine,\\
54 - just for a little while?\\
55 - Sure, come here, put it on.\\
56 - Oh!\\
57 - Ooh!\\
58 - Be careful, now.\\
59 - Don't wrinkle it.\\
60 - I won't.\\
61 - And don't get attached to it,\\
62 - Miss Minnie Mink.\\
63 - Oh, I can dream, can't I?\\
64 - Hi, everybody!\\
65 - Hi!\\
66 - Ethel, a mink coat!\\
67 - When did you get it?\\
68 - Uh...\\
69 - Just now.\\
70 - But from whom?\\
71 - Him.\\
72 - Fred!\\
73 - Oh, uh, wasn't that generous of old
fat Fred?\\
74 - Oh, my goodness, yes!\\
75 - What was the occasion, Fred?\\
76 - Oh, I just thought it was about time
to buy the old battle-ax...\\
77 - the-the little woman a trinket of
some kind,\\
78 - so I picked up that bunch of skins.\\
79 - Oh, bunch of skins.\\
80 - Isn't he wonderful?\\
81 - Oh, Ethel you look so beautiful and
so glamorous.\\
82 - Honey, look, I got something to tell
you.\\
83 - Don't talk to me, you tightwad!\\
84 - Lucy!\\
85 - It's a pity you couldn't buy me a
coat\\
86 - if he could buy one for her.\\
87 - How can you stand there and laugh\\
88 - when I feel so awful?\\
89 - You know I've always wanted a mink
coat,\\
90 - - and now she...
-  she...\\
91 - Oh, Lucy!\\
92 - Oh, I'm sorry, Ricky.\\
93 - That's all right, Ethel.\\
94 - I'll straighten it out.\\
95 - Lucy!\\
96 - Honey! Honey, don't cry.\\
97 - Let me explain.\\
98 - Don't bother.\\
99 - Oh, honey, I'm trying to tell you\\
100 - that coat doesn't belong to Ethel.\\
101 - It's all right.\\
102 - I can wear this ratty old cloth coat\\
103 - for another four...\\
104 - It doesn't?\\
105 - No, I brought the coat home.\\
106 - Ethel was just trying it on.\\
107 - Oh, honey, you big, wonderful
husband.\\
108 - Wait, wait!\\
109 - Honey, you don't understand, honey!\\
110 - Yes, I do understand.\\
111 - You were just making a big joke with
me.\\
112 - Now, honey...\\
113 - Where's my coat?\\
114 - Where's my coat?\\
115 - It's mine.\\
116 - Oh, it's mine, Ethel!\\
117 - Oh, isn't it beautiful?\\
118 - It's just dreamy.\\
119 - Honey, honey, wait.\\
120 - Before you get too excited, honey,\\
121 - it's something I have to tell you.\\
122 - What?\\
123 - Well, honey, you see...\\
124 - You know what's wonderful about this
present, Ricky?\\
125 - You didn't forget our anniversary.\\
126 - Well, look, honey, I...\\
127 - It's the most perfect present.\\
128 - How did you know it was just what I
wanted, honey?\\
129 - Well, honey, you see, what I was... I
only...\\
130 - I had a hunch you'd like it.\\
131 - Oh, you had a hunch.\\
132 - And you two sly ones in on the joke
all the time.\\
133 - Yeah.\\
134 - Happy anniversary.\\
135 - Thank you!\\
136 - Ricky, I'm so in love with this coat\\
137 - that I'm never going to take it off.\\
138 - Never, never, never!\\
139 - Come on, Ethel, let's see how I look
in the full-length mirror.\\
140 - Come on!\\
141 - Okay.\\
142 - Come on, already!\\
143 - All right.\\
144 - Why didn't you tell her the truth?\\
145 - If I tell her the truth\\
146 - it'd get me in worse hot water--\\
147 - forgetting our anniversary.\\
148 - I should have brought her something.\\
149 - You brought her something now,
brother.\\
150 - She can't keep it.\\
151 - I got to get it back somehow.\\
152 - How? She's never going to take it
off!\\
153 - "Never, never, never!"\\
154 - She's got to take it off when she
goes to bed.\\
155 - Hey! I'll sneak it away during the
night.\\
156 - I'll open a few drawers, mess things
up a little bit\\
157 - and I'll tell her it was stolen by a
burglar.\\
158 - Hey, you got something up there.\\
159 - How'd you ever get an idea like that?\\
160 - It's easy-- I think of it in Spanish\\
161 - and then I translate it into English.\\
162 - Wh-what happened?\\
163 - Nothing, honey.\\
164 - Go back to sleep.\\
165 - Lucy!\\
166 - Yes?\\
167 - What are you doing?\\
168 - Washing dishes.\\
169 - Washing dishes!\\
170 - Ricky, anything wrong, dear?\\
171 - Wrong?
Oh, no, honey, no.\\
172 - Good.\\
173 - No, there's nothing wrong.\\
174 - I'm going in and get dressed.\\
175 - I want to go downtown\\
176 - to show my coat off to everybody.\\
177 - All right.\\
178 - Lucy...\\
179 - You see, it's not for me.\\
180 - It's just that I want everybody to
realize\\
181 - what a wonderful, wonderful husband I
have.\\
182 - Anybody home?\\
183 - Come in, Fred.\\
184 - I gather from the look on your face\\
185 - that Lucy is still attached to that
coat.\\
186 - I'm beginning to think that the coat
is attached to Lucy.\\
187 - I don't know what to do, Fred.\\
188 - The show is tomorrow.\\
189 - I got to get that coat back tonight
or else.\\
190 - Well, you got any ideas?\\
191 - No.\\
192 - But there must be some way.\\
193 - I got it!\\
194 - What?
It's simple!\\
195 - Just tell her there was an epidemic
of sick minks last year\\
196 - and one of the bad skins slipped past
the fur inspector.\\
197 - What?
Sure.\\
198 - And you have to have that coat
fumigated.\\
199 - Otherwise, she might break out with\\
200 - a very bad case of mink pox.\\
201 - Mink's pox?\\
202 - Yeah, and it sounds even worse with
your accent.\\
203 - Now look, Fred, never mind, I don't
like that.\\
204 - Look, you remember the idea I had
about the burglar?\\
205 - Yeah.\\
206 - All right, the burglar is going to
show up tonight.\\
207 - What?\\
208 - Tonight when we sound sleep,\\
209 - a phony burglar is going to come in
here\\
210 - and demand that coat at the point of
a gun.\\
211 - Hey, that's wonderful!\\
212 - Besides, there's been a burglar scare\\
213 - in the neighborhood lately.\\
214 - Yeah, that's what gave me the idea.\\
215 - Do you suppose she'll think he's a
phony?\\
216 - Not if you cover your face with a
mask.\\
217 - That's a good idea.\\
218 - Hey, wait a minute, now.\\
219 - I draw the line at prowling around\\
220 - in other people's apartments in the
middle of the night.\\
221 - Now, look, Fred.\\
222 - Uh... let's look at it this way.\\
223 - If you don't do it, Lucy will keep
the coat.\\
224 - Yeah.\\
225 - Now, Ethel wants\\
226 - everything that Lucy gets.\\
227 - Yeah.\\
228 - So pretty soon,\\
229 - you will have to buy Ethel...\\
230 - All right, what time do you want me
to break in?\\
231 - Hey, what kept you?\\
232 - You're late.\\
233 - Stick them up!\\
234 - Ouch!\\
235 - What are you doing with that thing?\\
236 - Come on, let's wake her up.\\
237 - I said stick them up!\\
238 - Stop fooling around with that gun.\\
239 - Why do you have to ham it up\\
240 - all over the joint all the time?\\
241 - Come on.\\
242 - Now, listen, you stay right here\\
243 - until I wake her up.\\
244 - Shh.\\
245 - Lucy!
What?\\
246 - Lucy!
What?\\
247 - I got a feeling there's somebody else\\
248 - in this room besides us.\\
249 - Really?
Yeah.\\
250 - Hands up and keep them up!\\
251 - What's in this box?\\
252 - Please, Mr. Burglar,\\
253 - take our money, take our jewels\\
254 - but don't take my wife's mink coat.\\
255 - It's worth 3,500 bucks... oh!\\
256 - Is that real mink?\\
257 - No, no, it's mink-dyed imitation
skunk.\\
258 - Eww! Smells awful, you wouldn't want
it.\\
259 - Hand it over.\\
260 - No, no, no!\\
261 - No, no!\\
262 - Hand me that coat.\\
263 - No, you can't have it.\\
264 - No!\\
265 - Give me that coat.\\
266 - No!\\
267 - Lady!\\
268 - Hand over that coat or I'll shoot.\\
269 - Wait a minute.\\
270 - Okay, go ahead and shoot.\\
271 - Look, lady, I don't want to get
nasty.\\
272 - Hand me that coat.\\
273 - No! Ricky, do something.\\
274 - All right, honey.\\
275 - Listen, you, are you really going to
shoot us\\
276 - if we don't give you this coat?\\
277 - Yeah.\\
278 - My hero!\\
279 - Honey, your life is worth much more
to me\\
280 - than a hunk of fur.\\
281 - What's that?\\
282 - A ladder!\\
283 - Hey, there's something screwy about
this joint.\\
284 - I'm getting out of here.\\
285 - Hey, you forgot the coat!\\
286 - Ricky, are you crazy?!\\
287 - Give me that!\\
288 - What's the matter with you?!\\
289 - Honey, be careful.\\
290 - I'm going to call the police.\\
291 - Be careful.\\
292 - Stick them up!\\
293 - Pretty good, eh, Rick?\\
294 - Oh, you've already been here.\\
295 - I have?\\
296 - I have not!\\
297 - Y-y-you mean that...
that... that guy was real?\\
298 - What do you mean?\\
299 - There was a real burglar here a
minute ago.\\
300 - Oh, no!\\
301 - Yes!\\
302 - Come on, let's go catch him.\\
303 - I don't want to catch him.\\
304 - What are you afraid of?\\
305 - You've got a gun.\\
306 - I don't think I'd better use it on
him.\\
307 - Why not?\\
308 - Good morning, Lucy.\\
309 - Hello.\\
310 - What's the matter with you?\\
311 - Oh.\\
312 - Gee, I thought you'd be happy this
morning.\\
313 - Believe me, I'd be happy\\
314 - if a burglar came and didn't get my
mink coat.\\
315 - Well, I'm happy about that, but I'm
so disappointed in Ricky.\\
316 - Ethel, I'm married to a coward.\\
317 - Are you still moping 'cause Ricky
didn't struggle\\
318 - with an armed burglar?\\
319 - Well, you should have seen it.\\
320 - Ricky gave him the coat.\\
321 - I'm surprised he didn't gift wrap it
for him.\\
322 - Oh...\\
323 - Well, the way Ricky was acting,\\
324 - it's good the burglar didn't come in
and ask for me.\\
325 - Now, Lucy.\\
326 - I'm sure Ricky would have been brave\\
327 - if he'd known it was a real burglar.\\
328 - Uh... I think I hear Fred
calling me.\\
329 - Ethel, what are you saying?\\
330 - What do you mean-- real burglar?\\
331 - Uh... nothing, just, uh...\\
332 - Ethel, what did you start to say?\\
333 - Well, I might as well tell you.\\
334 - It's better than\\
335 - your thinking Ricky is a coward,
anyway.\\
336 - Was it a real burglar or wasn't it?\\
337 - It really was, but Ricky thought it
was Fred.\\
338 - Fred?\\
339 - Yes, that's why he didn't try to
fight him.\\
340 - Well, why would Fred pretend to be a
burglar?\\
341 - Uh... I can't tell you any more.\\
342 - Lucy!\\
343 - Please! I'm not a yo-yo!\\
344 - Ethel, I want the whole story.\\
345 - All right, your honor.\\
346 - Well, you see, Ricky didn't intend to
give you the coat.\\
347 - He just rented it to use for a
dancing number down at the club.\\
348 - You mean this isn't my coat?\\
349 - No, honey.\\
350 - Oh...\\
351 - But at least you know\\
352 - Ricky isn't a coward.\\
353 - How do you like that?\\
354 - All this time he let me go on
thinking this was my coat.\\
355 - I've been living in a mink's
paradise.\\
356 - Now, Lucy, don't get upset.\\
357 - Oh, I'm going to get even with him\\
358 - if it's the last thing I do.\\
359 - I ought to carve my initials in it\\
360 - with an electric razor.\\
361 - Ohh!\\
362 - What are you going to do?\\
363 - You know that costume store downtown\\
364 - where they sell imitation fur coats?\\
365 - Yeah.\\
366 - Well, I'm going down there today\\
367 - and I'm going to get a coat exactly
like this.\\
368 - And tonight when Ricky comes home...\\
369 - Lucy, this is a pretty poor
imitation.\\
370 - Don't you think Ricky will know it
isn't real mink?\\
371 - Well, honey, I will,\\
372 - but I don't think Ricky will.\\
373 - You know how men are.
Yeah.\\
374 - I've got this thing fixed\\
375 - so it'll scare him to death.\\
376 - Now, when we go out there, this is
what I want you to do.\\
377 - Have you figured out\\
378 - how to get the coat away from her?\\
379 - Yup.\\
380 - How?\\
381 - I'm going to tell her the truth.\\
382 - Gosh, I hadn't thought of that.\\
383 - But what of the anniversary?\\
384 - I'll get her a couple of minks\\
385 - and let her raise her own coat.\\
386 - - Hiya, fellas!
- Hi, girls.\\
387 - Ethel, what are you doing in
that coat?\\
388 - I asked her to put it on.\\
389 - I want to take a look at it.\\
390 - I'm thinking of restyling it.\\
391 - Restyling it?\\
392 - Yeah, I think I look better\\
393 - in a short jacket, don't you, Ethel?\\
394 - Uh-huh.\\
395 - What are you cutting?\\
396 - What are you cutting!?\\
397 - What are you cutting?\\
398 - Oh, no! No, no, no!\\
399 - Just a minute.\\
400 - Oh, no, no, it's terrible!\\
401 - They've gone crazy.\\
402 - Crazy they've gone, both of them.\\
403 - You know what I think?\\
404 - I think that it's unbalanced.\\
405 - I think it needs shorter sleeves.\\
406 - No, please, please.\\
407 - Please don't cut it no more.\\
408 - Please...\\
409 - Oh!... look at that.\\
410 - Well, it'll make a nice muff.\\
411 - Hey, look at me, I'm a fur stylist!\\
412 - Oh... no, no!\\
413 - Oh, no, no.\\
414 - There you are.\\
415 - Congratulations, Ethel.\\
416 - You're the first woman to ever wear a
mink T-shirt.\\
417 - Look, Ricky.\\
418 - Ohh!\\
419 - How do you like it?\\
420 - It's darling.\\
421 - Ricky sent it to me at noon\\
422 - and at 3:00, these came, and at 5:00,
this arrived.\\
423 - Oh!
Isn't it dreamy?\\
424 - Yeah.\\
425 - Even though you didn't get a mink
coat,\\
426 - I think you did pretty well for your
anniversary.\\
427 - So do I, considering it wasn't our
anniversary.\\
428 - Lucy, what do you mean?\\
429 - Well, whenever there's a good present
in sight,\\
430 - I always tell Ricky it's our
anniversary.\\
431 - Oh, no!\\
432 - When is your anniversary?\\
433 - It's on, um... uh...\\
434 - Well, how do you like that?\\
435 - I've fibbed about it so much and now
I've forgotten.\\
436 - Ricky, darling, I just love the
things you sent!\\
437 - I'm glad, honey.\\
438 - You know, I actually ordered all
these things\\
439 - for your anniversary last week\\
440 - but, uh, the store forgot to send
them.\\
441 - Really?\\
442 - Yes-- happy anniversary, Lucy.\\
443 - Happy anniversary, darling.
\subsection {Episode 10: Lucy Is Jealous Of Girl Singer (1951)}
1 - Good morning, Lucy.\\
2 - Lucy!\\
3 - Good morning.\\
4 - Shh! Ricky's still asleep.\\
5 - What's on your mind, Ethel?\\
6 - Oh, nothing.\\
7 - You want to borrow something?\\
8 - Eggs, sugar, flour?\\
9 - No, thanks.\\
10 - Are you sure there's nothing on your
mind?\\
11 - No, not a thing.\\
12 - How about a cup of coffee?\\
13 - No, thanks.\\
14 - Well, I must say\\
15 - you're taking it calmly.\\
16 - How's that?\\
17 - I said I must say you're taking it
calmly.\\
18 - Now it comes.\\
19 - What's on your mind, Ethel?\\
20 - Look, honey, you don't have to
pretend with me.\\
21 - I come to you this morning\\
22 - not just as a landlady, not just as a
friend,\\
23 - but as a shoulder on which to weep\\
24 - in this time of crisis.\\
25 - Well.\\
26 - I think you've been twisting those
curlers too tight.\\
27 - Oh, honey, you're wonderful.\\
28 - It's not every wife\\
29 - who can keep her sense of humor\\
30 - when her husband's running around\\
31 - with another woman.\\
32 - Oh, Ethel.\\
33 - Where'd you ever get an idea like
that?\\
34 - What do you mean another woman?\\
35 - Have you seen this morning's paper?\\
36 - No.\\
37 - Oh, well, I'm not going to be\\
38 - the one to show it to you.\\
39 - Oh, you're not?\\
40 - Page eight, column two.\\
41 - "What Cuban bandleader with the
initials R.R.\\
42 - "is making cat's eyes at his dancing
mouse?\\
43 - "There's more going on during that
floor show\\
44 - than the script calls for."\\
45 - Oh, Ethel, that's just a publicity
story.\\
46 - It is, huh?\\
47 - Sure, Ricky's press agent put that
in.\\
48 - He did, huh?\\
49 - Certainly. He has to keep Ricky's
name before the public.\\
50 - He does, huh?\\
51 - Ricky doesn't care anything\\
52 - about that new dancer of his.\\
53 - Ha! What's she like?\\
54 - Rosemary?\\
55 - Oh, she's a brunette\\
56 - and she has a wonderful figure\\
57 - and she's... young and... quite
pretty.\\
58 - Oh, Ethel, it's just a publicity
story.\\
59 - Ricky is trustworthy, fine, honest
and loyal.\\
60 - Well, if he was brave, clean and
thrifty\\
61 - he'd be a Boy Scout.\\
62 - A cat's eye patrol, of course.\\
63 - All right, Ethel, that's enough.\\
64 - I'll be right down, Fred.\\
65 - Look, honey, don't let this get you
down.\\
66 - Ethel, I love Ricky.\\
67 - He's the most wonderful husband in
the world,\\
68 - and I trust him implicitly.\\
69 - You just keep saying that.\\
70 - Ricky, it's time to get up, dear.\\
71 - Time to get up, Ricky.\\
72 - Hi, honey.\\
73 - Are you awake, dear?\\
74 - Uh-huh.\\
75 - Hey, hey, hey, hey!\\
76 - Hey, what's that for?\\
77 - That's for being a big two-timer,\\
78 - you... you Cuban heel.\\
79 - What?\\
80 - Open your big cat's eyes and read
this.\\
81 - Hey, cut it out!\\
82 - Honey, honey, cut it out!\\
83 - Honey, come on, now.\\
84 - Cut it out.\\
85 - That's just a publicity story.\\
86 - It is, huh?\\
87 - Sure, my press agent put that in.\\
88 - He did, huh?\\
89 - Well, he has to keep my name in front
of the public.\\
90 - He does, huh?\\
91 - Why, honey, I don't care anything
about that new dancer.\\
92 - Ha!\\
93 - Oh, honey.\\
94 - You can trust me.\\
95 - I can, huh?\\
96 - Why, sure.\\
97 - I'm as faithful as an old dog.\\
98 - Yeah, old Rover.\\
99 - Oh, Lucy, you know\\
100 - I don't love anyone else but you.\\
101 - There's nothing between Rosemary and
me, honey.\\
102 - Cross your heart?\\
103 - Well, I think I have\\
104 - a better way to convince you.\\
105 - Did that convince you?\\
106 - What were we talking about?\\
107 - I don't know.\\
108 - Oh, Rosemary.\\
109 - Oh.\\
110 - Honey, now, you got to get used to
those kind of stories.\\
111 - You know, they're going to keep
showing up\\
112 - as long as I'm in show business.\\
113 - Well...\\
114 - Look, honey, why don't you come down
to the club\\
115 - and see for yourself.\\
116 - Oh, no, that's not necessary.\\
117 - Well, if there's any doubt in your
mind at all...\\
118 - No, no.
None whatsoever.\\
119 - Come on, honey, you've got to get
dressed.\\
120 - You'll be late for rehearsal.\\
121 - Okay, Rosemary.\\
122 - What?!\\
123 - I meant Lucy.\\
124 - Yeah.\\
125 - All right, all right, break it up,
break it up.\\
126 - We have to go through the whole
Saturday night show.\\
127 - Come on.\\
128 - Let's break it up.\\
129 - You're always squawking about
something.\\
130 - Come on, will you?\\
131 - We got a lot of work to do today.\\
132 - Playing cards, arguing about the
salary,\\
133 - reading the racing form...\\
134 - Where is Rosemary?\\
135 - Is she late again?\\
136 - No, no, she's getting into her
costume\\
137 - for the Jezebel number.\\
138 - All right.\\
139 - Well, let's take a...
let's take a letter "A," huh?\\
140 - And please, the first fellow\\
141 - who acts like he's playing in his
sleep\\
142 - is going to get traded to Phil
Spitalny.\\
143 - Let's do it nice.\\
144 - Put a little pep into it.\\
145 - Here we go.\\
146 - All right, all right, all right.\\
147 - Hi, Ricky.\\
148 - Hi.\\
149 - Is this okay?\\
150 - That's great, if we don't get raided.\\
151 - Listen, I want to...\\
152 - Before we start on this number,\\
153 - I want to find out\\
154 - what happens in the first part of the
dance.\\
155 - You know, when you go around me\\
156 - in the first part of the number, how
does it go?\\
157 - Step, step, round.\\
158 - And then what else?\\
159 - You go around here again?\\
160 - And then I come back here.\\
161 - And then you come back and we go
again?\\
162 - Oh, no!\\
163 - Oh...\\
164 - Gee, me and my big feet.\\
165 - I'm sorry, kid.\\
166 - Gee, I hope I can get it fixed by the
show.\\
167 - Well, I tell you what--\\
168 - give it to me and I'll have it fixed
for you.\\
169 - Oh, you're a doll.\\
170 - Well, I'll go and change before this
thing tears some more.\\
171 - All right.
I'll be back in a minute.\\
172 - Let's take something now that she's
gone.\\
173 - Let's take "Cumbachero," huh?\\
174 - From the top?\\
175 - All right, here we go.\\
176 - Wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
177 - Something is wrong with that first
chord there.\\
178 - Wait a minute.\\
179 - I've got an E-natural there, Ricky.\\
180 - E-natural?\\
181 - That should be E-flat concert.\\
182 - Let's try it, I think that's right.\\
183 - Just the brass alone.\\
184 - That's it, that's it.\\
185 - Now, everybody now.\\
186 - All right?\\
187 - Here we go.\\
188 - Here it is.\\
189 - Oh, put it in my coat pocket, will
you?\\
190 - Listen, get, uh...
the Jezebel number, now.\\
191 - When she's ready, all right?\\
192 - The Jezebel number from the top.\\
193 - Everybody.\\
194 - Here we go.\\
195 - Who is it?\\
196 - What?\\
197 - Look, honey, chicken and rice.\\
198 - Arroz con pollo!\\
199 - Yeah.
Oh, boy!\\
200 - What did I do to rate all this?\\
201 - Well, I'm trying to make up for being
so silly this morning.\\
202 - Oh, honey, forget it.\\
203 - No.\\
204 - I was wrong to mistrust you and I'm
ashamed of myself.\\
205 - Do you forgive me?\\
206 - Well, I... I guess so.\\
207 - Of course, I was terribly hurt.\\
208 - Oh.\\
209 - How could you possibly think\\
210 - that I could look at anyone else but
you?\\
211 - Oh, go on-- you didn't give it a
second thought all day.\\
212 - I din't, huh?\\
213 - No, you din't.\\
214 - Listen, I couldn't think of anything
else.\\
215 - You know where I spent all afternoon?\\
216 - Where?\\
217 - Uh... I went to the park.\\
218 - Oh?\\
219 - Yeah, I went to the park and...\\
220 - I sat there and...
I fed the pigeons\\
221 - and, uh... and I brooded.\\
222 - You mean you didn't even go to
rehearsal?\\
223 - Uh...?\\
224 - Is that what you meant to tell me?\\
225 - Well, that's not exactly what I meant
to tell you...\\
226 - Oh, honey, then you do care about me.\\
227 - Of course, I do.\\
228 - You were so upset you couldn't even
go to rehearsal.\\
229 - That's right, honey.\\
230 - Oh-ho, baby.\\
231 - Honey, let's eat, would you?\\
232 - I'm hungry.\\
233 - Look at all that wonderful food!\\
234 - What is this?\\
235 - What is that?\\
236 - Now, now, baby, now.\\
237 - Don't "now, baby" me.\\
238 - What is this?\\
239 - Oh! Oh, that.\\
240 - Oh, well, that's, uh...\\
241 - that's, uh...\\
242 - a black-lace...\\
243 - Blue jeans?\\
244 - Now, honey...\\
245 - So this is why you didn't go to
rehearsal today.\\
246 - Now, wait a minute, honey.\\
247 - You may have been in the park all
afternoon,\\
248 - but you weren't feeding the pigeons.\\
249 - Now, Lucy, if you just give me\\
250 - a chance to 'splain.\\
251 - All right.\\
252 - All right, I want to be fair about
this.\\
253 - 'Splain.\\
254 - Well, you...\\
255 - You'll have to speak louder than
that.\\
256 - All right, I'll tell you the truth.\\
257 - Well, that'll be novel.\\
258 - You haven't tried that before.\\
259 - I did not go to the park this
afternoon and fed the pigeons.\\
260 - No.\\
261 - I went to rehearsal.\\
262 - Yeah.\\
263 - And that's Rosemary's, uh...\\
264 - black-lace, uh...\\
265 - Blue jeans.\\
266 - Yeah.\\
267 - I tore it by mistake,\\
268 - so she took it off and she put it in
my pocket.\\
269 - Ha!\\
270 - Well, if you don't believe me, ask
the boys in the band.\\
271 - They were all there.\\
272 - Well, that must have been a cozy
gathering.\\
273 - Now, look, honey, I went to
rehearsal.\\
274 - That's part of the costume\\
275 - that Rosemary wears in the Jezebel
number.\\
276 - I stepped on it, it tore, she took it
off,\\
277 - she put in my pocket\\
278 - and I brought it home for you to fix.\\
279 - Is that the truth, Ricky?\\
280 - Cross my heart.\\
281 - You do believe me, don't you, honey?\\
282 - Of course, dear.\\
283 - There is one other question I'd like
to ask you, though.\\
284 - What's that?\\
285 - Where were you this afternoon?!\\
286 - Now, look, honey, I told you the
truth\\
287 - and that's the end of it.\\
288 - No, it isn't.\\
289 - All right, if you don't believe me,\\
290 - come down to the club tonight and see
for yourself.\\
291 - You're darn right, I will.\\
292 - All right!
All right!\\
293 - Well, good-bye.\\
294 - Good-bye!\\
295 - Excuse me.\\
296 - Come on in, Ethel.\\
297 - I was just...
polishing the doorknob.\\
298 - I suppose you heard everything.\\
299 - No, honey, not a thing.\\
300 - Well, I just quarreled with Ricky.\\
301 - I don't blame you.\\
302 - Who does he think he is\\
303 - going around, tearing girls'
black-lace blue jeans?\\
304 - Didn't hear a thing, huh?\\
305 - Well, I might have caught a word here
and there.\\
306 - You going to throw all that food out?\\
307 - Well, Ricky, doesn't want it.\\
308 - Do you want some?\\
309 - Um... no, I'm not a bit hungry.\\
310 - Well, I might just taste it to see
how your recipe is.\\
311 - What's your next move, honey?\\
312 - I'm going down to that club tonight.\\
313 - He's pretty clever asking you to come
down to the club.\\
314 - Huh?\\
315 - You're not dumb enough to fall for
that, are you?\\
316 - I should say not.\\
317 - Fall for what?\\
318 - You go down there tonight; he knows
you're coming;\\
319 - he's on his good behavior; you're
satisfied;\\
320 - you come home; and he starts playing
cat and mouse again.\\
321 - Why, that big stinker!\\
322 - Well, gee, what'll I do?\\
323 - You're going to call him up\\
324 - and tell him you're not coming down.\\
325 - Yeah!\\
326 - Why?\\
327 - Because you're going to sneak in
there without his knowing it\\
328 - and watch the floor show and see
what's really going on.\\
329 - Gee, that's a wonderful idea.\\
330 - I'll call right now.\\
331 - Oh, wait a minute.\\
332 - I can't sneak into the club.\\
333 - Everybody knows me down there.\\
334 - That won't work.\\
335 - Well, we'll think of something.\\
336 - Well, what?\\
337 - I don't know, but you call him up\\
338 - and tell him you're not coming down.\\
339 - All right.
Just leave it to me.\\
340 - Okay.\\
341 - Hello, this is Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.\\
342 - Would you please tell Mr. Ricardo\\
343 - that I won't be able to come down to
the club tonight.\\
344 - That's right.\\
345 - Thank you.\\
346 - I've got it.\\
347 - What?\\
348 - Where's the best place to see what
he's doing on the stage?\\
349 - Where?\\
350 - Right on the stage.\\
351 - Now, he does a number with Rosemary,
doesn't he?\\
352 - Yeah.\\
353 - And there are dancing girls...\\
354 - Right over there\\
355 - is where the girls go onto the stage.\\
356 - Now make sure you get the
girls out there\\
357 - in time for the Jezebel number.\\
358 - And tell Bill Caine, the electrician,
to be on his toes.\\
359 - That's my favorite number and I don't
want it loused up.\\
360 - Now, get going.\\
361 - We got to hide.\\
362 - Hey, wait a minute.\\
363 - There's something else I want to show
you in here.\\
364 - Would be better had I never known\\
365 - A lover such as you\\
366 - Forsaken dreams are all for the siren
call of your arms\\
367 - Like a demon love possess me you\\
368 - Obsess me constantly\\
369 - Whatever star is mine that my fate's
design should be\\
370 - Jezebel\\
371 - Jezebel\\
372 - If ever a devil was born without a
pair of horns\\
373 - It was you\\
374 - Jezebel\\
375 - It was you\\
376 - If ever an angel fell\\
377 - Jezebel\\
378 - It was you\\
379 - Jezebel\\
380 - It was you\\
381 - If ever a pair of eyes promised
paradise\\
382 - Deceiving me, grieving me, leaving me
blue\\
383 - Jezebel\\
384 - It was you.\\
385 - If ever a pair of eyes promised
paradise\\
386 - Deceiving me, grieving me, leaving me
blue...\\
387 - Jezebel\\
388 - Jezebel\\
389 - If ever the devil's plan was made to
torment man\\
390 - It was you\\
391 - Night and day, every way...\\
392 - Jezebel\\
393 - Jezebel...\\
394 - Jezebel!\\
395 - Lucy!\\
396 - Lucy.\\
397 - Oh, did I wake you up, dear?\\
398 - Oh, that's all right.\\
399 - I went to bed early.\\
400 - Oh, you did?\\
401 - Yeah, about 8:30.\\
402 - What time is it?\\
403 - It's about 2:30.\\
404 - Oh, really?\\
405 - You know, the funniest thing happened
tonight\\
406 - down at the club.
What?\\
407 - A strange girl got into the chorus
line.\\
408 - Oh, really?\\
409 - Yeah.\\
410 - She was terrible, too.\\
411 - She was real ugly.\\
412 - And she had the worst figure I've
ever seen.\\
413 - And she didn't know any of the steps
at all.\\
414 - Well, how could a thing like that\\
415 - possibly happen, dear?\\
416 - I haven't got the slightest idea.\\
417 - Oh, you knew it all the time.\\
418 - Come here.
\subsection {Episode 11: Drafted (1951)}
1 - Yoo-hoo!\\
2 - Yoo-hoo!\\
3 - Morning, Lucy, I brought up your
mail.\\
4 - Thanks, Ethel.\\
5 - A bill, a bill, a letter for Ricky,
an ad...\\
6 - Oh, a postcard, isn't that pretty.\\
7 - Oh, it's from the Bishers.\\
8 - "Dear Ricky and Lucy:\\
9 - "Having a wonderful time here in
Miami.\\
10 - "Leaving tomorrow for the uh, uh...\\
11 - Everglades.\\
12 - "The Everglades.\\
13 - "Ben has been fishing\\
14 - "and last week caught a 115-pound,
uh...\\
15 - Sailfish.\\
16 - "Sa..."\\
17 - Well, go ahead, tell me what the rest
of the card says.\\
18 - Getting a wonderful tan.\\
19 - We'll call you when we get home next
week.\\
20 - Love, Edna and Ben.\\
21 - What time was it postmarked?\\
22 - 4:30.\\
23 - A.M. or P.M.?\\
24 - Really, Ethel, I'm surprised at you!\\
25 - You know, this is a federal offense.\\
26 - If it wasn't for our friendship,\\
27 - I'd turn you over to the FBI.\\
28 - Thanks, terribly.\\
29 - No, really, I mean it.\\
30 - Reading another person's mail is just
awful.\\
31 - A person's mail is something sacred.\\
32 - It's like, like a diary.\\
33 - Why, Ricky and I wouldn't think\\
34 - of reading each other's mail.\\
35 - Now, take this letter, for instance.\\
36 - It's addressed to Ricky\\
37 - and it's from the War Department.\\
38 - Now, I'm curious, but I'm certainly
not going to...\\
39 - War Department?!\\
40 - Gee, you don't think Ricky's been...\\
41 - been...\\
42 - Drafted!\\
43 - Oh, please, Ethel.\\
44 - I, I wasn't going to say it out loud.\\
45 - Oh, look!\\
46 - Cheap glue.\\
47 - "You are hereby ordered to report\\
48 - to Fort Dix, New Jersey, Monday at
3:00."\\
49 - And it's signed, "Maurice Thompson,\\
50 - Colonel Infantry Commanding Officer."\\
51 - It's true!\\
52 - Ricky's been drafted!\\
53 - Now, Lucy, you've got to be brave.\\
54 - I'll be brave.\\
55 - Is that being brave?\\
56 - It is for a coward like me.\\
57 - Oh, now, Lucy, pull yourself
together.\\
58 - You know what you ought to do?\\
59 - What?\\
60 - Go downtown and buy a new hat.\\
61 - Oh, Ethel, please don't make jokes.\\
62 - I'm not joking.\\
63 - It'll take your mind off your
troubles.\\
64 - No use sitting around here moping.\\
65 - Well, maybe shopping would help,\\
66 - and while I'm downtown, I'll buy some
yarn\\
67 - so I can knit Ricky some socks to
wear with his uniform.\\
68 - That's a good idea!
Now, get your coat.\\
69 - All right.\\
70 - Oh, I got to glue this back together
again..\\
71 - I'll fix it.\\
72 - I've had lots of practice at this.\\
73 - Oh, all right.\\
74 - Oh, you know, I know where\\
75 - there's a dilly of a hat!\\
76 - To take my mind off my troubles, you
know.\\
77 - Yes.\\
78 - Yes.\\
79 - Ethel!\\
80 - Hiya, Fred.\\
81 - Hi, Rick, is Ethel up here?\\
82 - No, I haven't seen her.\\
83 - She and Lucy must be out shopping
someplace.\\
84 - Uh-oh, that'll cost me.\\
85 - Hey, we got a card from the Bishers.\\
86 - They're in Florida.\\
87 - Yeah, how do you like that guy
catching a 115-pound sailfish?\\
88 - How did you know that he caught a
hundred and...\\
89 - Oh, Ethel.\\
90 - Some people build model airplanes.\\
91 - Ethel reads postcards.\\
92 - Oh, good, I got my orders to go to
Fort Dix Monday.\\
93 - Orders! Fort Dix!\\
94 - Hold on, Fred, hold on.\\
95 - I haven't been drafted.\\
96 - Take it easy.\\
97 - No, I'm just taking a show down there
to entertain the boys,\\
98 - and you know how the Army is.\\
99 - You can't even scratch yourself
without orders.\\
100 - A show! Hey, that ought to be a lot
of fun.\\
101 - Well, why don't you come along?\\
102 - You can do one of your old Vaudeville
routines?\\
103 - Great! You know, I used to do a Civil
War act in Vaudeville.\\
104 - I played the North, and my partner
played the South.\\
105 - I still got the costumes.\\
106 - Really?\\
107 - Want to do it with me?\\
108 - Why sure, I'll be perfect for it--\\
109 - Stonewall Ricardo\\
110 - from south Havana.\\
111 - I'll show you how the thing goes.\\
112 - All right, Fred.\\
113 - Hey, I can use that broom there\\
114 - for the musket.\\
115 - Ta da...\\
116 - Uh-oh, we're supposed to go out to
dinner Monday night,\\
117 - but I'll just tell Ethel I'd rather
do this.\\
118 - Look, whatever you do\\
119 - don't tell Ethel where you're going\\
120 - because if you tell Ethel, she'll
tell Lucy,\\
121 - and Lucy will want to get into the
act.\\
122 - Well, why don't you let her sing a
song or something?\\
123 - It wouldn't be patriotic.\\
124 - Patriotic?\\
125 - Have you ever heard Lucy sing?\\
126 - No.\\
127 - Our fighting men have been through
enough.\\
128 - Okay, not a word to Ethel.\\
129 - I'll just tell her I'm not available
Monday night,\\
130 - and I won't tell her why.\\
131 - And boy, that'll drive her crazy.\\
132 - Now, spread out and I'll show you how
this thing...\\
133 - Okay.
Spread out.\\
134 - Hi.\\
135 - Hi.\\
136 - Ricky, did you read the mail, dear?\\
137 - Mm-hmm.\\
138 - Well?\\
139 - Well what?\\
140 - Well, was there anything interesting
or different?\\
141 - No...\\
142 - Oh, yes, there was something.\\
143 - Oh? What?\\
144 - Ben Bisher caught a 115-pound
sailfish.\\
145 - Oh. Don't you have anything else to
tell me, Ricky?\\
146 - About what?\\
147 - About, about, about...\\
148 - What's new.\\
149 - Lucy, are you all right?\\
150 - I'm fine.\\
151 - Well, honey, what are you crying
about?\\
152 - Did something happen?\\
153 - Yes, yes, that's it, something
happened.\\
154 - Well, what?\\
155 - Well, I bought a new hat\\
156 - and I don't know if you'll like it.\\
157 - Oh, honey, is that all?\\
158 - Well, let me see it.\\
159 - Oh, all right.\\
160 - Why, honey, I like it.\\
161 - It's real cute.\\
162 - I'm glad.\\
163 - Hi, Ethel.\\
164 - Hi.\\
165 - It's all true, Ethel.\\
166 - Ricky's been drafted and he's trying
to spare me\\
167 - by not telling me about it.\\
168 - Oh, Ethel, you're such a good friend\\
169 - to take my troubles so hard.\\
170 - Thanks, but I've got troubles of my
own.\\
171 - Fred just told me he's going with
Ricky Monday.\\
172 - What?\\
173 - He wouldn't tell me where, bless his
fat little heart.\\
174 - You mean, he's been drafted?\\
175 - No, they're not that hard up.\\
176 - He must have enlisted.\\
177 - Ethel, we got to pull ourselves
together.\\
178 - If our men are going to be\\
179 - so brave and so wonderful,\\
180 - the least we can do is make it\\
181 - as easy as possible for them.\\
182 - Yes.\\
183 - I'm knitting some socks for Fred,
too.\\
184 - That's nice.\\
185 - We got to be brave, Lucy.\\
186 - Brave.\\
187 - We've got to keep a stiff upper lip.\\
188 - Stiff.\\
189 - Halt! Parade rest!\\
190 - Right shoulder, arms!\\
191 - One, two, three!\\
192 - No, no, no!\\
193 - Who told you to throw your gun away?\\
194 - I'm sorry, Fred.\\
195 - Oh, you're sorry.\\
196 - What good does that do me?\\
197 - Come on, now, try it again.\\
198 - All right.\\
199 - Left face!\\
200 - Forward march!\\
201 - Hut!\\
202 - Hut!\\
203 - Hut!\\
204 - Hut!\\
205 - What's the matter with you, Ricky?\\
206 - Why did you hut it?\\
207 - I didn't hut it, I was coughing!\\
208 - Well, how can I know whether you're
coughing or hutting?\\
209 - I don't know where you're going.\\
210 - I'm going this way, and you hut, hut,
hut.\\
211 - You've been doing it all afternoon.\\
212 - Now, what's the matter with you?\\
213 - Well, I'm sorry, Fred.\\
214 - I just don't seem to be able to
concentrate.\\
215 - I'm worried.\\
216 - About what?\\
217 - Well, maybe you can help me.\\
218 - You've been married for a long while,
haven't you?\\
219 - Now, why bring that up when we're
having such a good time?\\
220 - Well, maybe you know women better
than I do.\\
221 - Lucy's been acting strange lately.\\
222 - Strange?
How can you tell?\\
223 - Look, I'm serious.\\
224 - I mean, for one thing, she breaks
into tears\\
225 - for no reason at all,\\
226 - and she seems terribly nervous.\\
227 - And the other day, I walked into the
room\\
228 - and she hid whatever she was doing
behind her back.\\
229 - It looked like knitting.\\
230 - Knitting?!\\
231 - Yeah.\\
232 - Well, Ricky, my boy, congratulations!\\
233 - Congratulations?\\
234 - Why, it's as plain as the nose on
your face.\\
235 - You're going to be a father.\\
236 - Me? Father?\\
237 - When a woman cries for no reason,\\
238 - sits down and knits tiny little
things,\\
239 - what else?\\
240 - Me? Father?\\
241 - Of course!\\
242 - Me? Father?\\
243 - Yeah, you father, Lucy mother,\\
244 - me Tarzan!\\
245 - Oh, gosh.\\
246 - Well, now that we've straightened out\\
247 - your paternal status, let's go on
with the routine.\\
248 - Okay.\\
249 - Of course, it could be something
else.\\
250 - When are you going to take facts like
I do, Ricky?\\
251 - Ethel is nervous and weepy lately,
too.\\
252 - She's been knitting little things\\
253 - and hiding them from me.\\
254 - But you don't think that I...\\
255 - that I...\\
256 - No! Oh, no!\\
257 - Fred!\\
258 - Congratulations, old boy!\\
259 - Imagine that, both of them!\\
260 - I can't imagine it.\\
261 - Isn't that wonderful!\\
262 - Let's give them a shower.\\
263 - What for?\\
264 - I mean a surprise party shower.\\
265 - And we can try our act out on the
crowd.\\
266 - All right, we'll give them a surprise
party Sunday night\\
267 - before we leave for Fort Dix.\\
268 - Good deal!\\
269 - Gee whiz, Lucy's going to be a mother\\
270 - and I'm going to be a father.\\
271 - I know just how you feel, son.\\
272 - Ethel's going to be a mother\\
273 - and I'm going to be a f... f... f...\\
274 - Ethel, does this look right?\\
275 - Right for what?\\
276 - Well, you don't have to get nasty
about it.\\
277 - I suppose yours is going to win a
prize.\\
278 - It's better than yours.\\
279 - Let's see.\\
280 - Yeah, I guess you're right.\\
281 - Gee, I guess I'm past the sock stage.\\
282 - I better try for a blanket.\\
283 - I think you're past the blanket
stage.\\
284 - You'd better try for a tent.\\
285 - Oh, well, I'm surprised we can knit
at all,\\
286 - what with our husbands going into the
Army.\\
287 - Our two wonderful little boys.\\
288 - Yeah. Gee, they're so anxious to be
good soldiers.\\
289 - You know what they were doing\\
290 - when I went up to the apartment a
little while ago?\\
291 - What?\\
292 - Drilling.\\
293 - Drilling.
Yeah.\\
294 - Marching up and down with a broom and
a mop.\\
295 - Oh, I wish there was something more
we could do for them\\
296 - besides just knitting socks and
tents.\\
297 - I know, let's give them a going-away
party.\\
298 - A surprise party!\\
299 - Yeah, we'll give it Sunday night just
before they leave.\\
300 - That's a wonderful idea.\\
301 - Who will we ask?\\
302 - Well, let's see now, there's the
Sedgewicks,\\
303 - the Orsattis, the Bezelles, Billy
Josefi...\\
304 - Ethel, do you think the boys found
out about the party tonight?\\
305 - No. They can't think about anything
but going into the Army.\\
306 - Yeah. Gee, this is their last night
as civilians.\\
307 - Now, remember, we're not going to
argue with them,\\
308 - no matter what happens.\\
309 - I wouldn't think of it.\\
310 - Where are they now?\\
311 - They're downstairs drilling.\\
312 - Bless their little britches.\\
313 - Now, here's the plan for the party:\\
314 - I told everybody that I'd leave the
front door unlocked.\\
315 - Unlocked.
Yeah.\\
316 - And that they should tiptoe in and
hide someplace.\\
317 - How we gonna keep the boys occupied
so they won't notice?\\
318 - Oh, now, don't worry.\\
319 - We'll manage some way.\\
320 - Who left this door unlocked?\\
321 - I don't know.\\
322 - Listen, do you think the girls
suspect anything\\
323 - about the party tonight?\\
324 - No, with all that knitting\\
325 - and acting like little mothers,\\
326 - they don't know anything else is
going on.\\
327 - Listen, I told everybody\\
328 - that I was going to leave the back
door unlocked,\\
329 - and that they should sneak in through
the kitchen.\\
330 - So I want you to keep your eye on the
kitchen door.\\
331 - Well, how we gonna hide them from the
girls?\\
332 - Well, look, whenever the people start
coming in,\\
333 - we'll just have to figure out some
way\\
334 - to get the girls back into the
bedroom.\\
335 - Watch it now, here they come.\\
336 - I don't know.\\
337 - Oh, hi, fellas.\\
338 - Hi.
Hi, girls.\\
339 - Did you hear anything?\\
340 - I thought I did.\\
341 - I think someone's at the door.\\
342 - I'll get it.\\
343 - No, no, I'll get it!\\
344 - I'll get it!\\
345 - Oh, all right.\\
346 - No, there's no one here.\\
347 - Ricky, would you get me a drink of
water, please, dear?\\
348 - Oh, all right.\\
349 - I'd like a glass of water, too, Fred.\\
350 - Well, I'll get them both.\\
351 - No!
No!\\
352 - I can't drink a glass of water\\
353 - unless Fred brings it to me\\
354 - with his own little hands.\\
355 - Okay, I'll get 'em both.\\
356 - No!
No!\\
357 - Ricky... Ricky, honey, you wouldn't
want me to have anything\\
358 - that you didn't bring me your little
ole self,\\
359 - now, would you, baby?\\
360 - Well, honey, what difference would it
make...\\
361 - Well, it does make a difference,
though, honey.\\
362 - I can't tell you exactly what it is,\\
363 - but there is a difference.\\
364 - All right, all right.\\
365 - Well, we'll both go.\\
366 - Okay.\\
367 - Shh!\\
368 - Where?\\
369 - The closet!\\
370 - Who locked that door?\\
371 - Well, unlock it.\\
372 - We brought you milk.\\
373 - Milk?\\
374 - It's better for you.\\
375 - Oh, thanks.\\
376 - How's the milk, girls?\\
377 - Fine.\\
378 - It's all right if you like
milk.\\
379 - Uh, Lucy...\\
380 - Hmm?\\
381 - Your nose is shiny.\\
382 - It is? I just powdered it.\\
383 - Well, stand still a minute, will you?\\
384 - I want to see how my hair looks.\\
385 - Oh, you!\\
386 - Okay, I'll go powder it.\\
387 - Ethel's nose is shiny, too.\\
388 - It is not, is it, Fred?\\
389 - Well, I can't tell,\\
390 - there's such a bright reflection
coming off...\\
391 - Now, listen, Fred Mertz, it...\\
392 - Oh, all right.\\
393 - I'll go powder my nose.\\
394 - Where?\\
395 - The closet!\\
396 - Shh!\\
397 - Well, here we are.\\
398 - Do we look any better?\\
399 - Oh, yes, fine.
Look great now.\\
400 - Uh, Ricky, I'm thirsty again.\\
401 - Would you get me a drink of water,
dear?\\
402 - Well, honey, you haven't finished
this one yet.\\
403 - Oh.\\
404 - More milk.\\
405 - Ethel, you just had a full glass of
milk.\\
406 - I don't know why I seem to be so
thirsty tonight.\\
407 - I must have had something salty for
dinner.\\
408 - All right, all right, more milk.\\
409 - I'll get you some more, too, honey.\\
410 - All right.\\
411 - Shh!\\
412 - The closet?\\
413 - The closet.\\
414 - Here you are, girls.\\
415 - Uh, Lucy?\\
416 - What?\\
417 - Your nose is shiny again.\\
418 - Oh, now, Ricky, really, it couldn't
be shiny...\\
419 - Oh, all right, dear.\\
420 - And Ethel...\\
421 - I know, I'm going.\\
422 - Where?\\
423 - The closet!\\
424 - Hey, Fred, come on, I got a wonderful
idea.\\
425 - Good.\\
426 - Oh, Lucy, you're crazy!\\
427 - I'm glad you kids didn't lose your
sense of humor.\\
428 - Why should we lose our sense of
humor?\\
429 - Yeah.\\
430 - Well, you know how women act\\
431 - when they're in your condition.\\
432 - My condition?
What's my condition?\\
433 - Well, honey...\\
434 - The same as Ethel's.\\
435 - Ethel's?\\
436 - Sure, we know all about it.\\
437 - Come on, honey, sit down.\\
438 - You have to take it real easy, you
know,\\
439 - and have a good rest,\\
440 - be real comfortable all the time.\\
441 - Fred, what are you talking about?\\
442 - Come on, darling, sit down now.\\
443 - Why?\\
444 - Coochie, coochie, coochie.\\
445 - Now, wait a minute.\\
446 - You guys act like somebody's going to
have a baby.\\
447 - Well, someone is.\\
448 - Well, don't look at me!\\
449 - Well, don't look at me!\\
450 - Well, don't look at us!\\
451 - Well, what made you think\\
452 - anybody was going to have a baby?\\
453 - Well what were all those little
things that you were knitting?\\
454 - Knitting!\\
455 - Oh, honey, we were knitting socks\\
456 - for you and Fred to take to Fort Dix
tomorrow.\\
457 - You knew about that?\\
458 - Yes, and we're just dying to see you
in your uniforms.\\
459 - Well, come on, Rick, let's put them
on.\\
460 - Yeah, we'll put them on!\\
461 - Let's go, Fred!\\
462 - We'll put them right on.\\
463 - Oh, imagine them thinking we were
going to have babies!\\
464 - Yeah, they certainly can jump at some
wrong conclusions.\\
465 - Yeah. Gee, I wish there were\\
466 - some wrong conclusions that we could
jump to.\\
467 - Are you ready, girls?!\\
468 - Yes!
Yeah, we're ready.\\
469 - Ooh, we're going to get to see our
soldier boys!\\
470 - Are you ready, Colonel Mertz?\\
471 - Colonel?\\
472 - Ready, General Ricardo!\\
473 - General?\\
474 - Ethel, they're fighting on opposite
sides!\\
475 - Oh, Ricky, you should have seen\\
476 - the expression on your face!\\
477 - Well, honey, how was I supposed to
know?\\
478 - Well, we all did some pretty fancy
jumping to conclusions!\\
479 - You know what?
What?\\
480 - We invited everyone here\\
481 - for a going-away party!\\
482 - No kidding!\\
483 - Well, you know something?\\
484 - We invited them over here for a
shower.\\
485 - A shower?\\
486 - The closet!\\
487 - Oh, look at these poor people!\\
488 - Easy!\\
489 - Easy!\\
490 - Easy!\\
491 - Pull them apart!
Pull them apart!\\
492 - Unglue, unglue.\\
493 - Unglue them there, pull them apart!\\
494 - Lucy and Ricky will be
back with a little surprise.\\
495 - Stand by.\\
496 - Oh, look!\\
497 - Fred!
Ethel!
Lucy!\\
498 - Fred!\\
499 - Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!\\
500 - Merry Christmas, Fred.\\
501 - We're all Santa Clauses.\\
502 - Yeah.\\
503 - How about that.\\
504 - Let's put our presents under the

505 - Okay, okay, here we go.\\
506 - Oh, that's nice.\\
507 - Gee!\\
508 - Hey, Santa, you put on\\
509 - a little weight, didn't you?\\
510 - How about you?\\
511 - Yeah.\\
512 - How about you, Ethel?\\
513 - Fred, where'd you ever find such a
big pillow?\\
514 - Huh? Why aren't you answering me?\\
515 - I'm not wearing a pillow.\\
516 - Oh!\\
517 - Come on, let's open all our presents.\\
518 - All right.\\
519 - Okay.\\
520 - Oh, no, no, let's sing first.\\
521 - Sing?
Sing?
Sing?\\
522 - Well, yeah.\\
523 - Everything is so wonderful,\\
524 - and spending Christmas with our good
friends...\\
525 - I just feel like serenading the
world.\\
526 - Okay.\\
527 - I know a wonderful Cuban melody.\\
528 - It's called "Cascabeles."\\
529 - Well, let's hear it.\\
530 - Go ahead, sing it.
All right.\\
531 - Cascabeles, cascabeles\\
532 - Cantan todo el dÃ­a\\
533 - Cascabeles, cascabeles\\
534 - Traen la alegria\\
535 - Hey!\\
536 - That's "Jingle Bells."\\
537 - "Jingle Bells"?\\
538 - Sure.\\
539 - Well, how about that.\\
540 - You Americans steal all our good
songs.\\
541 - Hey, let's all sing it, huh, Santa
Clauses?\\
542 - All right.
All right.
All right.\\

one-horse open sleigh\\
545 - Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle
all the way\\
546 - Oh, what fun it is to ride in a
one-horse open sleigh\\
547 - Dashing through the snow, in a
one-horse open sleigh\\
548 - O'er the fields we go, laughing all
the way\\
549 - Bells on bobtail ring, making spirits
bright\\
550 - What fun it is to ride and sing\\
551 - A sleighing song tonight\\
552 - Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way\\

\subsection {Episode 12: The Adagio (1951)}
1 - Mm... that was good, Lucy.\\
2 - Want some more?\\
3 - I have eight or nine pieces left in
the kitchen.\\
4 - No, three's my limit.\\
5 - Ha!\\
6 - Well, I guess I'd better go put on a
new face.\\
7 - Yeah, me too.\\
8 - Say, did you see that little
polka-dot dress at Orbach's?\\
9 - The one with the white, ruffled
collar?\\
10 - Wasn't that the cutest thing\\
11 - you've ever seen?\\
12 - What's that for?\\
13 - Well, I'm always hoping that this
time will be the charm.\\
14 - What do you mean?\\
15 - Ethel keeps going out to put on a new
face\\
16 - but she always comes back with the
old one.\\
17 - Well, you know how women are.\\
18 - Yeah.\\
19 - If Lucy doesn't have any lipstick on,\\
20 - she thinks she's naked.\\
21 - "Niked"?\\
22 - Yeah, you know-- not wearing a thing.\\
23 - A thin what?\\
24 - Clothes, clothes, clothes.\\
25 - "Niked"-- not wearing no thin
clothes.\\
26 - Nah, me either.\\
27 - Uh-huh, same old one.\\
28 - Same old one here, too.\\
29 - What are they talking about?\\
30 - I don't know, but whatever it is,\\
31 - ours aren't young enough.\\
32 - We were just teasing you, honey,
because you said\\
33 - you were going to go in and put on a
new face, and you didn't.\\
34 - Oh, Ethel, did you ever wish\\
35 - there was something else to marry
besides men?\\
36 - Often.\\
37 - Well, what are we gonna do tonight\\
38 - besides sit around and sneer at each
other?\\
39 - Shall I look in the paper?\\
40 - Yeah.\\
41 - I better call Jerry.\\
42 - Wouldn't it be quicker to look in the
paper?\\
43 - This is for something else.\\
44 - Oh.\\
45 - I'm having some trouble finding some
apache dancers for my show.\\
46 - Apache dancers?\\
47 - Yeah.\\
48 - Lucy.\\
49 - Lucy!\\
50 - What?\\
51 - Not that kind, honey.\\
52 - It's for the Parisian number.
Oh.\\
53 - The French kind.\\
54 - A French Indian?\\
55 - Oui, oui.\\
56 - Oui, oui\\
57 - Oui, oui\\
58 - Oui, oui...\\
59 - No, no, Lucy.\\
60 - You know, where the tough Frenchman\\
61 - grabs the girl by the hair and throws
her over his shoulder\\
62 - and slams her down on the floor and
steps on her.\\
63 - Oh!\\
64 - Oh.\\
65 - Wait.\\
66 - Oh!\\
67 - Ah-ah-ahhhh!\\
68 - Lucy.\\
69 - Lucy.\\
70 - Lucy!\\
71 - What?\\
72 - I got your message.\\
73 - You want to be in the show, right?\\
74 - Right.\\
75 - And you think you can do the dance,
right?\\
76 - Right.\\
77 - Well, honey, you don't have to go
into all this routines.\\
78 - I don't?\\
79 - No, honey.\\
80 - All you have to do is just come out
and ask me--\\
81 - "Ricky, can I be in the show?"\\
82 - Really?\\
83 - Of course.\\
84 - Ricky, can I be in the show?\\
85 - No.\\
86 - Jerry.
You're mean.\\
87 - You didn't even let me finish the
audition.\\
88 - Hold on a minute, Jerry, will you?\\
89 - You give everybody else a chance...\\
90 - What do you mean, "what's going on?"\\
91 - My wife is acting crazy again, Jerry.\\
92 - Now, look, you just hold on like I
told you to do, Jerry--\\
93 - just wait a minute.\\
94 - iAy, que barbaridad!\\
95 - Relax, Lucy, relax.\\
96 - Oh, he makes me so mad.\\
97 - There are just two things\\
98 - keeping me from dancing in that show.\\
99 - Your feet?\\
100 - No.\\
101 - A partner and some rehearsal.\\
102 - It's a wonderful opportunity for
somebody.\\
103 - Even if you had a partner,\\
104 - Ricky wouldn't hire you.\\
105 - Well, you heard what he said.\\
106 - He's having trouble finding somebody.\\
107 - Maybe if I had a partner and we were
really good,\\
108 - Ricky couldn't turn me down.\\
109 - It's a wonderful opportunity for...
somebody.\\
110 - Yeah, but who?\\
111 - Well...\\
112 - Gee, I wonder\\
113 - what Fred Astaire is doing these
days.\\
114 - Lucy.\\
115 - Coming.\\
116 - Hi, Ethel.\\
117 - Hi.\\
118 - Uh...\\
119 - Something on your mind, Ethel?\\
120 - No... yes.\\
121 - Well, that covers the territory
pretty well.\\
122 - Lucy, were you serious last night\\
123 - about finding that partner for the
apache dance?\\
124 - I certainly was.\\
125 - Well, I've got him for you-- Fred.\\
126 - Fred!\\
127 - Astaire!\\
128 - Ta-da!\\
129 - Oh, Mertz.\\
130 - Now, Lucy, before you make up your
mind, listen.\\
131 - Fred used to be a headliner in
vaudeville.\\
132 - Why, he can dance circles\\
133 - around any of the younger men today.\\
134 - He's the king of the apache dancers.\\
135 - There, I said it.\\
136 - Do I get my new hat?\\
137 - Yes.\\
138 - Well, thanks a lot, Fred, but I don't
think...\\
139 - Oh, now, listen, Lucy.
He's really not half bad.\\
140 - He might work out fine.\\
141 - Why don't you give him a chance?\\
142 - Yeah.\\
143 - Well, all right.\\
144 - I suppose a fat apache is better than
none.\\
145 - Okay, you're on your own.\\
146 - See you later.\\
147 - Bye.\\
148 - Now we can start rehearsing, huh?\\
149 - Oh, all right.\\
150 - Now, let's get going.\\
151 - Well, I don't know much about this,
but...\\
152 - Well, I'm gonna show you-- now, here.\\
153 - Put your hands together behind your
back.\\
154 - Put 'em up a little higher.\\
155 - Now turn around.\\
156 - Now... Now we face each other and
look in each other's eyes.\\
157 - Where are you?\\
158 - I'm down here.\\
159 - Well, it's impossible to look into
each other's eyes.\\
160 - No, it isn't; we've got to do it.\\
161 - All apache dancers do it.\\
162 - Now, you come down a little and I'll
come up.\\
163 - All right.\\
164 - Hey... whoa...
right in there.\\
165 - Hold that.\\
166 - Yeah.\\
167 - Now we put our heads together.\\
168 - Now stare in each other's eyes.\\
169 - All right.\\
170 - Now we go forward.\\
171 - Okay.\\
172 - Are you ready?\\
173 - Yep.\\
174 - Da, da, da, de--\\
175 - Forward, I said forward.\\
176 - I went forward.\\
177 - I mean I go forward and you go
backward.\\
178 - Well, why didn't you say that?\\
179 - I did.\\
180 - You did not.\\
181 - Now, don't argue with me.\\
182 - I'm the one who knows about this.\\
183 - All right.\\
184 - Oh, come on, let's try it again.\\
185 - Put your hands behind your back.\\
186 - All right.\\
187 - Now, turn around.\\
188 - Now, put our heads together.\\
189 - All right.\\
190 - Look in each other's eyes.\\
191 - Okay.\\
192 - Now, are you ready?\\
193 - Yeah.\\
194 - Da, da, da...\\
195 - Da, da, da, da da, da dum-- bam\\
196 - Da, da, da...\\
197 - Da, da, da, da da, da dum-- bam\\
198 - Oh, Fred, I'm sorry.\\
199 - You're sorry.\\
200 - Yeah, that helps a lot.\\
201 - Fred, I'll be careful next time.\\
202 - Try it yourself this time, will you?\\
203 - All right.\\
204 - All right, now, put your hands behind
your back.\\
205 - All right.\\
206 - All right, now.\\
207 - Stand still, will you?\\
208 - All right, yeah.\\
209 - Are you ready?\\
210 - Yeah.\\
211 - Da, da, da...\\
212 - Da, da, da, da da, da dum-- bam\\
213 - Da, da, da...\\
214 - Da, da, da, da da, da dum-- bam\\
215 - I guess I dah-ed when I should have
dum-ed.\\
216 - Yeah.\\
217 - Oh, Fred, I'm sorry.\\
218 - You're sorry and I'm crippled.\\
219 - Oh, come on, let's go on from here.\\
220 - Let's try something else.\\
221 - Okay.
Here.\\
222 - Now I grab you by the wrist\\
223 - and hurl you to the floor.\\
224 - What?\\
225 - I grab you by the wrist and hurl you
to the floor.\\
226 - Okay.\\
227 - I said I grab you by the wrist\\
228 - and hurl you to the floor.\\
229 - Okay.\\
230 - What's the matter with you?\\
231 - Are you nailed down?\\
232 - Well, Fred, maybe you weren't doing
it right.\\
233 - Now, you said you take me by the
wrist\\
234 - and you hurl me to the floor.\\
235 - Is that what you mean?\\
236 - Yes, that's exactly what I mean.\\
237 - But there's a little bug in it
someplace.\\
238 - We've got to figure out\\
239 - how to get you down here and me up
there.\\
240 - Lucy!
What?\\
241 - Lucy, I've got the most wonderful
news.\\
242 - What?\\
243 - Well, this is going to cost me a new
hat,\\
244 - but I found the perfect partner for
you.\\
245 - Really? Who?\\
246 - I'm sorry, Fred,\\
247 - but I'm about to dethrone you\\
248 - as king of the apache dancers.\\
249 - You're a little late.\\
250 - I've just abdicated.\\
251 - Who was it?\\
252 - The owner of the French laundry has a
nephew\\
253 - who just got here from Paris, and
he's an apache dancer.\\
254 - Really?
What's his name?\\
255 - His name is-- now, I want to say it\\
256 - just like he did--\\
257 - his name is Jean-Valjean Raymond.\\
258 - Onh?\\
259 - Jean-Valjean Raymond.\\
260 - Jean-Valjean Raymond.\\
261 - Onh.
Onh.\\
262 - I asked him to come over here this
afternoon.\\
263 - Is that all right?
Yeah, that's wonderful.\\
264 - Ricky will be at rehearsal all day.\\
265 - Oh, I envy you spending all afternoon\\
266 - with a romantic Frenchman.\\
267 - Oh, Ethel, don't be silly.\\
268 - This is strictly business.\\
269 - Onh?\\
270 - Onh.\\
271 - Madame Ricardo?\\
272 - Yes?\\
273 - I am Jean-Valjean Raymond.\\
274 - Oh!\\
275 - Won't you come in, please?\\
276 - It was so good of you to come this
afternoon.\\
277 - What's the matter?\\
278 - Oh, madame.\\
279 - But you have such a beautiful hand!\\
280 - Oh, really?\\
281 - Well, I have another one just like
it.\\
282 - Please, we better get to the dancing.\\
283 - Oh, but you don't understand, madame.\\
284 - The apache dance is a dance of amour.\\
285 - One must warm up to it.\\
286 - Yeah, well, I think you started
warming up\\
287 - on the way over here.\\
288 - I can't help it.\\
289 - I can't help it.\\
290 - There's a pounding in my heart.\\
291 - You don't watch out, there'll be a
pounding on your head.\\
292 - Lucy, Ricky's coming.\\
293 - Ricky?!\\
294 - I just saw him coming up the front
stairs.\\
295 - Oh, no! Quickly, quickly!\\
296 - Vite?
My husband.\\
297 - Oh, vite!\\
298 - Here, here.\\
299 - Hi, honey.\\
300 - Oh!\\
301 - Oh, hello, Ricky.\\
302 - What are you doing here?\\
303 - I live here, remember?\\
304 - I mean, what are you doing home in
the afternoon?\\
305 - Oh, I forgot this music, honey.\\
306 - I need it for rehearsal.\\
307 - Oh, gee, it's a shame you can't stay
for a minute.\\
308 - Oh, I guess I can stay a minute or
two.\\
309 - Oh, no, no, you better go.\\
310 - What's the matter with you?\\
311 - Well, I guess I'm just excited\\
312 - because you're...
h-home in the afternoon.\\
313 - Well!\\
314 - If you're going to get that excited,\\
315 - I should never leave.\\
316 - I'll see you tonight.\\
317 - Oh, good-bye, dear.\\
318 - I better get my hat; it looks like
rain.\\
319 - Oh, I'll get it, I'll get it.\\
320 - All right, thank you.\\
321 - There.\\
322 - Thank you, honey.\\
323 - Maybe I should take an umbrella, too.\\
324 - Oh, I'll get it, I'll get it.\\
325 - No, I guess not.\\
326 - Still, I hate to get soaked on the
way down to the club.\\
327 - Ah, the heck with it.\\
328 - I'll see you tonight, honey.\\
329 - Is he gone?\\
330 - Huh?\\
331 - Your husband, is he gone?\\
332 - Oh, yes, he's gone.\\
333 - Oh, ma cherie, now I know how you
really feel about me.\\
334 - Kiss me!\\
335 - No!\\
336 - Why are you American women\\
337 - so stubborn?\\
338 - Why are you Frenchmen so amorous?\\
339 - I don't know.\\
340 - Just fortunate, I guess.\\
341 - Kiss me.\\
342 - No!\\
343 - But if all you wanted me was to dance
with you,\\
344 - why did you hide me from your
husband?\\
345 - Because I want to get a job dancing
in his show\\
346 - and I don't want him to know that I'm
rehearsing with you.\\
347 - Am I not romantic to you?\\
348 - Yes, you are not romantic to me.\\
349 - Now, please go.\\
350 - Very well.\\
351 - I shall go.\\
352 - Thank goodness.\\
353 - But...
I shall return\\
354 - and I shall look for ways\\
355 - to make myself more romantic\\
356 - in your beautiful, big, blue eyes.\\
357 - Ewww...\\
358 - Vive la romance.\\
359 - Well!\\
360 - What are you doing, dear?\\
361 - Oh, just getting comfortable.\\
362 - Put your shoe back on.\\
363 - I promised the Mertzes we'd go to the
movies with them tonight.\\
364 - They'll be up in a few minutes.\\
365 - Oh... all right.\\
366 - Lucy?\\
367 - Yes, dear, you have to shave.\\
368 - Shave, shave, shave.\\
369 - All this shaving is liable to wear my
chin away.\\
370 - Okay, Andy Gump.\\
371 - Shh! shh!\\
372 - What are you doing here?\\
373 - Oh, this is more romantic.\\
374 - We will elope together.\\
375 - Elope? Are you out of your mind?\\
376 - Now, get out of here.\\
377 - No, please don't.\\
378 - Oh!\\
379 - What happened?\\
380 - The ladder-- she went down without
me.\\
381 - Fine, now what are you going to do?\\
382 - Lucy?\\
383 - Shh!\\
384 - Lucy?\\
385 - What is it?!\\
386 - No hot water again.\\
387 - Did you tell Ethel\\
388 - to fix the hot- water heater?\\
389 - Yes, I talked to her.\\
390 - Well, she better fix it\\
391 - or I'm going to move.\\
392 - I cut myself to pieces in here.\\
393 - Feels like I shaved with the top of a
tin can.\\
394 - Tin can?\\
395 - Yeah.\\
396 - You know, it wouldn't be such a bad
idea to move, at that.\\
397 - How would you like to live in the
country and commute?\\
398 - Oh, I'd like that.\\
399 - Uh, honey, you'd better go get your
shirt on.\\
400 - The Mertzes will be here any minute.\\
401 - Oh, we have lots of time.\\
402 - Want a cigarette?\\
403 - Yeah, light it for me, dear.\\
404 - All right.\\
405 - Hey, look at me.\\
406 - I'm making like Paul Henreid.\\
407 - Uh, put it in my mouth, dear.\\
408 - Do you want me to smoke it for you?\\
409 - You know, living in the country\\
410 - wouldn't be a bad idea at all\\
411 - with the trees and the flowers...\\
412 - the birds singing...\\
413 - tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet,
tweet-tweet.\\
414 - Tweet-tweet.\\
415 - Where would you like to live,\\
416 - Long Island or Westchester?\\
417 - Westchester.\\
418 - Yeah, you know,\\
419 - it would be real wonderful\\
420 - to be away from the crowd and the
noise and the nightclubs.\\
421 - And the smoke.\\
422 - We could get a place in New Jersey.
That's nice...\\
423 - What's that?\\
424 - What's that?\\
425 - Hey, there's a man out here!\\
426 - Hey, hold it now.\\
427 - Hold on.\\
428 - I'll get...\\
429 - Hold on, now, hold on.\\
430 - Oh, thank you, monsieur.\\
431 - I thought I was going to fall.\\
432 - Who are you, and what are you doing
outside that window?\\
433 - Yeah, how about that?\\
434 - My ladder fell.\\
435 - I came here to elope with madame.\\
436 - Elope! What's going on here?\\
437 - How can you say a thing like that?\\
438 - What do you mean you came here...?\\
439 - Please, please, this is no time to
argue.\\
440 - If we stay here much longer,\\
441 - her stupid husband will return\\
442 - and find us here.\\
443 - Watch what you're saying!\\
444 - He's my stupid husband!\\
445 - He's my husband.\\
446 - All right, you, now you tell me
what's going on\\
447 - or I'll punch you right in the nose.\\
448 - Don't try to get away, you gigolo!\\
449 - Gigolo!\\
450 - I am very insulted.\\
451 - I challenge you to a duel.\\
452 - A duel!\\
453 - You got yourself a deal, brother.\\
454 - Very well.\\
455 - Tomorrow at dawn\\
456 - behind Radio City Music Hall.\\
457 - What do you mean, "tomorrow at dawn\\
458 - behind Radio City Music Hall"?\\
459 - Right now-- I'm ready now.\\
460 - Very well.\\
461 - I challenge you.\\
462 - You choose the weapons.\\
463 - These are good enough for me,
brother.\\
464 - Put 'em up.
Come on.\\
465 - Ricky, Ricky.\\
466 - Please, please, please-- too crude.\\
467 - Very vulgar.
It must be pistols.\\
468 - "Pee-stoles"?\\
469 - "Pee-stoles"?\\
470 - Who's got any "pee-stoles"?\\
471 - I'll hit you on top of the head with
a conga drum, you bum.\\
472 - Qu'est-ce que c'est "conga drum, you
bum"?\\
473 - Well, it's a long...\\
474 - and it's...\\
475 - and you...\\
476 - It'll hurt you.\\
477 - It must be pistols.\\
478 - Where are we going to get pistols?\\
479 - I have such a terrible temper\\
480 - that I always carry with me\\
481 - dueling pistols.\\
482 - Oh, no.
Oh, no!\\
483 - Okay, that's good enough for me.\\
484 - Ricky, you don't know what you're
doing.\\
485 - Come on, honey, this is liable to be
a bit messy.\\
486 - Ricky, I'm not worth it.\\
487 - I'm not worth it.
Out.\\
488 - I'm not worth it.
Out! Out!\\
489 - All right, I'm ready.\\
490 - Where did you go?\\
491 - Hey, Frenchy!\\
492 - All right.\\
493 - Please, put that thing away before
you kill somebody.\\
494 - You mean we're not going to duel?\\
495 - I hope not.\\
496 - Whew!\\
497 - That's the closest I've ever been to
a duel\\
498 - in my whole life.\\
499 - Me, too.\\
500 - What do you mean, "me, too"?\\
501 - It was a bum steer.\\
502 - I was told that it was safe\\
503 - to challenge people over here\\
504 - because American men would be afraid
to duel.\\
505 - American men, eh?\\
506 - I guess I fooled you with my Brooklyn
accent, eh?\\
507 - I guess I made what you call a
boo-boo.\\
508 - I guess you did.\\
509 - What about all this stuff\\
510 - about eloping with my wife?\\
511 - Is that another, uh... boo-boo?\\
512 - Oh, super-size.\\
513 - I was also told that American women\\
514 - expect Frenchmen to be romantic.\\
515 - I have a wife and five children of my
own.\\
516 - Then what are you doing here?\\
517 - I came here to be your wife's dance
partner\\
518 - in the apache dance.\\
519 - Oh.\\
520 - Ohhh...\\
521 - Oh, I smell a red-headed rat.\\
522 - I tell you what we're going to do,
amigo.\\
523 - This thing loaded?\\
524 - But yes.\\
525 - Ay!\\
526 - We're going to teach my wife a lesson\\
527 - she will never forget.\\
528 - You and I are going to do...\\
529 - Well, we're ready to go to the
movies.\\
530 - Lucy...\\
531 - what's the matter?\\
532 - They're in there.
They're going to fight a duel.\\
533 - A duel!
Yes!\\
534 - Who's dueling?\\
535 - Did he come back?\\
536 - Yes!
Who's dueling?\\
537 - How did it happen?\\
538 - He called him a gigolo.\\
539 - Who's dueling?\\
540 - Swords?\\
541 - Pistols.\\
542 - Who's dueling?\\
543 - Ricky and Jean-Valjean Raymond.\\
544 - All four of them?\\
545 - Oh, no.\\
546 - Sorry, madame, c'est la vie.\\
547 - Is he...?\\
548 - Oh, Ricky!\\
549 - Don't, madame.\\
550 - It isn't a pretty sight.\\
551 - Oh, this is all my fault.\\
552 - I killed him.\\
553 - Oh, you poor little thing.\\
554 - No, you didn't.
He did.\\
555 - You... you crepe suzette.\\
556 - If I hadn't wanted to do that apache
dance,\\
557 - this never would have happened.\\
558 - Oh, if I only had it to do over
again,\\
559 - I'd just be happy being Mrs. Ricky
Ricardo.\\
560 - Oh, Ethel, if I only had another
chance.\\
561 - All right\\
562 - I'll give you one more chance.\\
563 - Ricky!\\
564 - Ricky, you're all right.\\
565 - Oh, sure I'm all right.\\
566 - Honey, what happened?\\
567 - We both made a boo-boo.\\
568 - Oh, yoo-hoo.\\
569 - Vive la romance.\\
570 - Oh, honey, you should have seen your
face\\
571 - when I popped out of that room.\\
572 - Well, you scared me out of ten years'
growth.\\
573 - Oh, well, honey, I just wanted to
teach you a lesson.\\
574 - That's all.\\
575 - Yeah, I guess I had it coming to me.\\
576 - Well, good night, baby.\\
577 - Good night, sweetheart.\\
578 - Hey! what's that for?!\\
579 - Well, I've just been thinking it
over.\\
580 - That wasn't funny at all.\\
581 - That was a terrible thing to do to
me.\\
582 - How could you play such a dirty trick\\
583 - when you know the effect it would
have on me?\\
584 - Of all the inconsiderate, no-good,
lowdown...\\
585 - I don't think that I'll ever\\
586 - speak to you again.\\
587 - Captioned by Media Access Group at

played by Jeff Mencken.

1 - Ha, ha, that's it, partner.\\
2 - Game and rubber.\\
3 - How do you like that, Ricky?\\
4 - We didn't take a single trick.\\
5 - Yeah. Fortunately, you only bid six
spades-- double.\\
6 - Oh...\\
7 - When I was leading diamonds and you
didn't have any diamonds,\\
8 - why didn't you play trumps?\\
9 - I didn't have any trumps.\\
10 - I thought you knew that.\\
11 - Why do you think I was kicking you
under the table?\\
12 - You didn't kick me.\\
13 - Well, then, who did I kick?\\
14 - Is there any liniment in the house?\\
15 - Oh, Fred, I'm sorry.\\
16 - I didn't know I was kicking you.\\
17 - Oh, I rather enjoyed it.\\
18 - I thought we were playing shinsies.\\

21 - Let's see, you owe us 14,000... at,
uh...\\
22 - let's see five and carry two...\\
23 - 85 cents.\\
24 - Pay them, Ricky.\\
25 - I'll get my purse.\\
26 - Yeah, I've been sitting still too
long\\
27 - I'll tell you that.\\
28 - Oh, I have, too.\\
29 - "Shine On Harvest Moon"--\\
30 - what are you doing with this old
tune, Ricky?\\
31 - Oh, we're doing it in the show.\\
32 - You know, an old-fashioned June moon
number.\\
33 - Yeah?\\
34 - Here, sit down.\\
35 - Oh, sing, Ricky.\\
36 - All right.\\
37 - Oh, shine on...\\
38 - Shine on harvest moon\\
39 - Up in the sky\\
40 - I ain't had no loving\\
41 - Since January, February, June or July\\
42 - Hey, Fred, you're pretty good.\\
43 - Aw, sure he is.\\
44 - Let's take it from the top again.\\
45 - All right.\\
46 - Oh, shine on, shine on, harvest
moon, up in the sky\\
47 - I ain't had no loving\\
48 - Since January, February, June or July\\
49 - Show time ain't no time\\
50 - To stay outdoors...\\
51 - And spoon\\
52 - Shine on...\\
53 - Shine on...\\
54 - Hold it, hold it!\\
55 - Hold it.\\
56 - Somebody's singing off key.\\
57 - Yeah, watch that, will you?\\
58 - Somebody's singing off key.\\
59 - Well, who was it?\\
60 - Who was it?\\
61 - Well, there's only one way to find
out.\\
62 - Ahh.\\
63 - Fred?\\
64 - Ahh.\\
65 - Ethel?\\
66 - Ahh.\\
67 - Lucy?\\
68 - Ahh.\\
69 - At ease, mounties, we found our man.\\
70 - You have not.\\
71 - I hit the right note.\\
72 - The piano needs tuning.\\
73 - Oh, honey, why don't you just go and
sit down\\
74 - and listen to the rest of us, huh?\\
75 - No, either we all sing or nobody
sings.\\
76 - Well, all right then.\\
77 - If nobody wants to sing, I'll just
sing by myself.\\
78 - No!\\
79 - Well, of all the insulting...\\
80 - Now, honey, come on.\\
81 - Fix us a snack, huh?
I'm hungry.\\
82 - No, you can't insult me\\
83 - and then expect me to feed you.\\
84 - Oh, honey.\\
85 - Come on, Fred, let's see what's out
there.\\
86 - Coming, maestro.\\
87 - Oh, dear, I might just as well fix it
for them--\\
88 - they'll just get the kitchen all
messy.\\
89 - No, wait a minute, Lucy, I want to
talk to you.\\
90 - What about?\\
91 - Well, come sit down.\\
92 - You got to help me.\\
93 - My women's club wants Ricky.\\
94 - Well, I'd be very glad to help them
out, Ethel,\\
95 - but I'm not through with him yet.\\
96 - No, I didn't mean that.\\
97 - I mean, we want him to sing\\
98 - at a benefit my club is giving next
week,\\
99 - and I can't get up the nerve to ask
him.\\
100 - You ask him.\\
101 - Well... how would you like to have
the both of us?\\
102 - Is that the only way we can get
Ricky?\\
103 - Never mind that.\\
104 - Do you want us or don't you?\\
105 - Well...\\
106 - all right.\\
107 - Do you think you can get him to do
it?\\
108 - Sure, if I wheedle him.\\
109 - How soon? I got to have the posters
printed\\
110 - and the signs made for the front of
the theater, you know.\\
111 - You go ahead and have them made, I'll
work on Ricky.\\
112 - I'll start on him tonight just as
soon as you and Fred leave.\\
113 - Oh, good, we'll go right now.\\
114 - Fred?\\
115 - Come on, it's getting late.
We gotta go.\\
116 - But I'm hungry.\\
117 - Oh, come on.\\
118 - You can live off of that till
breakfast.\\
119 - Thanks, Lucy, for a lovely evening.\\
120 - Good-bye.\\
121 - 85 cents.\\
122 - Straighten it up in the morning,
honey.\\
123 - Okay, dear.\\
124 - Anything you say.\\
125 - Hi.\\
126 - Hello.\\
127 - You know, I was watching you tonight.\\
128 - You're cute.\\
129 - Thank you.\\
130 - You sure look handsome in that
smoking jacket.\\
131 - I do?\\
132 - Yeah... I love you.\\
133 - Lucy, what do you want?\\
134 - Nothing, I just love you, that's all.\\
135 - Well, that's nice.\\
136 - Do you love me?\\
137 - Sure, I love you.\\
138 - Would you climb the highest mountain
for me?\\
139 - Uh-huh.\\
140 - Would you swim the widest ocean?\\
141 - Yeah.\\
142 - Would you do anything in the world
for me?\\
143 - Yup--\\
144 - anything but sing at Ethel's club
next week.\\
145 - I don't know what you're talking
about.\\
146 - And who told you?\\
147 - Fred told me.\\
148 - Oh, that big blabbermouth.\\
149 - All right, if that's the way you feel
about it,\\
150 - I'll just tell Ethel we can't make
it.\\
151 - What did you say?\\
152 - I said, I'll just tell Ethel that we
can't make it.\\
153 - What do you mean "we"?\\
154 - Well, for your information,\\
155 - Ethel asked me to appear at that
benefit, too.\\
156 - I thought perhaps we could sing a
duet together.\\
157 - Oh, no.\\
158 - Oh, Ricky, wouldn't you do it for me?\\
159 - No.\\
160 - But I can't...\\
161 - No.\\
162 - No!\\
163 - Lucy, I am not going to appear\\
164 - at that benefit.\\
165 - Do you understand?\\
166 - And I don't want to hear another word
about it, right?\\
167 - That's better.\\
168 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
169 - Now, Lucy!\\
170 - Lucy!\\
171 - Lucy...\\
172 - All right, honey, all right.\\
173 - All right, I'll do it with you.\\
174 - You will?\\
175 - Yes, I will.\\
176 - I have an arrangement\\
177 - that you might be able to do.\\
178 - I'll bring it home tomorrow night\\
179 - and we can rehearse it.\\
180 - Oh, Ricky, you're wonderful!\\
181 - Mmm!\\
182 - Ahh.\\
183 - Ahh.\\
184 - Ahh.\\
185 - Ahh.\\
186 - Ahh.\\
187 - Ahh.\\
188 - Ahh.\\
189 - Ahh.\\
190 - Ahh.\\
191 - Ahh.\\
192 - Ahh.\\
193 - Ahh.\\
194 - Ahh.\\
195 - Ahh.\\
196 - Ahh.\\
197 - Ahh.\\
198 - Ahh.\\
199 - Ahh.\\
200 - Ahh.\\
201 - Hi, honey, I forgot my key.\\
202 - Where's the song, where's the song?\\
203 - Is this it?\\
204 - That's the song.\\
205 - Ha-ha!\\
206 - "Auf Wiedersehen"?\\
207 - That's a nice Cuban melody.\\
208 - Well, I thought it would be very good
for you.\\
209 - Well, come on, let's try it.\\
210 - All right.\\
211 - Here, give me that.\\
212 - This is your part,\\
213 - and this is mine.\\
214 - All of this is mine?\\
215 - Yeah.\\
216 - Oh, honey, that isn't fair to you.\\
217 - Well, sweetheart, you are the star.\\
218 - So you sing all the words\\
219 - that are written on your music,\\
220 - and I'll sing everything on mine.\\
221 - Okay.
All right?\\
222 - Are you ready?\\
223 - Yep.\\
224 - Okay, let's try it.\\
225 - Come, let us stroll down lovers' lane\\
226 - Once more to sing love's old refrain\\
227 - Soon we must say...\\
228 - Auf...\\
229 - Wiedersehen...\\
230 - Auf...\\
231 - Wiedersehen, my dear.\\
232 - Here in your arms I can't remain\\
233 - So let me kiss you once again\\
234 - Soon we must say...\\
235 - Auf...\\
236 - Wiedersehen...\\
237 - Auf...\\
238 - Wiedersehen, my dear.\\
239 - Your love will cling to me\\
240 - Through the lonely daytime\\
241 - Each night will bring to me\\
242 - The magic memory of Maytime.\\
243 - I know my heart won't beat again...\\
244 - Until the day we meet again\\
245 - Sweetheart, good-bye...\\
246 - Auf...\\
247 - Wiedersehen...\\
248 - Auf...\\
249 - Wiedersehen, my dear.\\
250 - What's the matter?\\
251 - Didn't you like the song?\\
252 - Auf!\\
253 - What's wrong with it?\\
254 - What's wrong with it?\\
255 - I sound like a hungry seal.\\
256 - Honey, don't be silly.\\
257 - The audience will love us.\\
258 - Well, they might love you, but
they're going throw me a fish.\\
259 - Ricky Ricardo, you bring me another
song.\\
260 - Well, I am very sorry, honey,\\
261 - but that is the only song that I have\\
262 - that will fit your voice.\\
263 - We'll just have to forget all about
the benefit.\\
264 - Well, you look again, you'll be able
to find me one.\\
265 - No, I wan't.\\
266 - Not much you want.\\
267 - You find me another song tomorrow\\
268 - or just dun't come home.\\
269 - Auf!\\
270 - Auf!\\
271 - Auf!\\
272 - Hey, Lucy, look.\\
273 - Isn't this wonderful?\\
274 - Look at that.\\
275 - Pretty good, huh?\\
276 - Lucy? What's the matter?\\
277 - Lucy?\\
278 - Ricky did say he'd do it, didn't he?\\
279 - Lucy?\\
280 - This is the right name, isn't it?\\
281 - Well, yes, with one minor change:\\
282 - Mrs. Ricky Ricardo!\\
283 - Oh, no...\\
284 - and the show's tonight.\\
285 - You were so sure you could wheedle
him.\\
286 - So you can't get Ricky.\\
287 - You still have me.\\
288 - After all, what's Ricky got that I
haven't got,\\
289 - except a band, a reputation...\\
290 - And talent.\\
291 - Well, now, let's not be unkind.\\
292 - Do you want me or don't you?\\
293 - Oh, I don't know.\\
294 - It's too late to have any new posters
printed\\
295 - and you are Mrs. Ricky Ricardo,\\
296 - but it's like expecting Clark Gable\\
297 - and getting Hubert Grimset.\\
298 - Hubert Grimset?
I never heard of him.\\
299 - Exactly.\\
300 - Well, you must admit, I'm better than
nothing.\\
301 - There you've got me.\\
302 - Just what were you intending to do in
this show tonight?\\
303 - Well, I'm not sure.\\
304 - I could sing.\\
305 - But I'm not going to by popular
demand.\\
306 - I could dance, but I don't have a
partner.\\
307 - Oh, dear.\\
308 - Oh...\\
309 - I know!\\
310 - Ricky's got a closet full of costumes
left from his shows.\\
311 - I'll find one that fits me\\
312 - and I'll build a whole act around it.\\
313 - Oh, let me help you.\\
314 - Haven't you ever seen this stuff in
here?\\
315 - No.\\
316 - Ohh!\\
317 - What a treasure trove.\\
318 - There's more stuff in there than you
can shake a stick at.\\
319 - Hey, here's a clown suit.\\
320 - This might do.\\
321 - Let's see.\\
322 - You'll get a lot of laughs with that.\\
323 - I'll say I will.\\
324 - Oh, moths.\\
325 - Yeah.\\
326 - Hey, what's this?\\
327 - I don't know.\\
328 - Why it's half...
half a horse.\\
329 - Say, those moths were hungrier\\
330 - than I thought.\\
331 - Hey, look, here's the rest of it.\\
332 - Oh, Ethel!\\
333 - This is it, this is it!\\
334 - We'll do a horse act.\\
335 - But it takes two people to do a horse
act.\\
336 - Well, what are you doing tonight?\\
337 - Me? I'm the chairman.\\
338 - So?\\
339 - I guess I could.\\
340 - Yeah, come on, let's try it on.\\
341 - Okay.\\
342 - Lucy!\\
343 - Ethel!\\
344 - Now!\\
345 - Ethel!
Oh...\\
346 - That's your half right there.\\
347 - No, sir, that's your half.\\
348 - Ethel, now let's be sensible about
this.\\
349 - Who's the big name in this twosome?\\
350 - I'm Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.\\
351 - Listen, Lucy, when you're inside a
horse,\\
352 - it doesn't matter if you're Mrs.
Hubert Grimset.\\
353 - I'm only doing this benefit for you.\\
354 - I should think you could do this one
little thing for me.\\
355 - Listen, Lucy, even for sweet charity,\\
356 - I am not going to be the back end of
a horse.\\
357 - Ethel, now, be sensible.\\
358 - Who's going to recognize you?\\
359 - You just said so yourself.\\
360 - Well...\\
361 - Come on, now try it on.\\
362 - Why do these things always happen to
me?\\
363 - Take off your shoes.\\
364 - Take off my shoes?
Yes.\\
365 - You have to step into this thing.\\
366 - This is the front.
That's right.\\
367 - Into the feet?
Yeah.\\
368 - Now, I'll hold onto you.\\
369 - Oh, if my family in Albuquerque could
see me,\\
370 - they'd die of shame.\\
371 - Speaking of Albuquerque--\\
372 - is it true that your father drinks
goat's milk?\\
373 - I only hope this fit the horse better\\
374 - than it does me.\\
375 - Turn around now.\\
376 - That's it.\\
377 - There.\\
378 - There, that looks wonderful!\\
379 - Are you sure nobody can tell who I
am?\\
380 - I defy anybody to recognize you.\\
381 - Hi, Lucy.\\
382 - I got something for you.\\
383 - Hello, Fred.\\
384 - Hello, Ethel.\\
385 - What did I tell you?\\
386 - Oh, now, Ethel...\\
387 - Fred had to know that was you in that
costume,\\
388 - didn't you Fred?\\
389 - What costume?\\
390 - That's all, brother-- count me out.\\
391 - Oh, Ethel!\\
392 - Oh, no.\\
393 - Oh, Ethel!\\
394 - Nothing doing.\\
395 - Lucy, I stopped by the club, and
Ricky asked me\\
396 - to bring you this.
Music?\\
397 - It's the number he's going to do with
you tonight\\
398 - at Ethel's benefit.\\
399 - Oh, Ethel, he's going to do it!\\
400 - Thank goodness.\\
401 - He wants you to look it over,\\
402 - and he'll join you there later.\\
403 - He's bringing the costumes.
Oh, wonderful.\\
404 - "Underneath the Bamboo Tree."\\
405 - Oh, Ethel, this is that cute song and
dance number\\
406 - that Ricky had in the show last year.\\
407 - I know it backwards.\\
408 - Da-da...
da-da, da-da\\
409 - Da-da...
da-da, da-da...\\
410 - What's all this?\\
411 - Oh, those are jokes--\\
412 - Ricky's got a cane that he taps on
the floor with\\
413 - when he wants the music to stop...\\
414 - And you tell one of these jokes.\\
415 - Oh, good, I love to tell jokes.\\
416 - Hey, rehearse them with me, will you,
Fred?\\
417 - Why, sure I will.\\
418 - Dya-dya...
dya-dya, dya-dya\\
419 - Dya-dya...
dya-dya, dya-dya\\
420 - Dya-dya...
dya-dya, dya-dya\\
421 - Tap, tap, tap.\\
422 - Tap, tap, tap.\\
423 - Hi, Lucy.\\
424 - Hiya, Ricky.\\
425 - You know, a funny thing happened to
me\\
426 - on the way to the theater this
evening.\\
427 - What?\\
428 - Well, a tramp come up to me in the
street\\
429 - and told me that he hadn't had a bite
in weeks.\\
430 - What did you do?\\
431 - I bit him.\\
432 - Oh, brother.\\
433 - You keep out of this, Whirlaway.\\
434 - Come on, let's get to my jokes.\\
435 - Da-da...
da-da, da-da.\\
436 - Tap, tap, tap.\\
437 - Did you hear...\\
438 - No, no, no, I forgot to tell you--\\
439 - that's Ricky's line.\\
440 - Did you hear about the big fire\\
441 - down at the shoe factory?\\
442 - What happened?\\
443 - 200 soles were lost.\\
444 - Ho, ho, ho-- what a boffola.\\
445 - He must be saving the good jokes for
me.\\
446 - Tap, tap, tap.\\
447 - You know, there are two things...\\
448 - Wo, wo, wo...\\
449 - That's Ricky's line, too.\\
450 - Oh, I was afraid of that.\\
451 - You know, there are two things that I
can't...\\
452 - Wait a minute.\\
453 - Who does he think he is?\\
454 - He's got all the funny lines for
himself.\\
455 - Well, I'm not going to do it with
him.\\
456 - Oh, now, Lucy.\\
457 - If you don't do it, Ricky won't.\\
458 - Well, I don't care.\\
459 - Oh, Lucy, I never thought I'd live\\
460 - to ask this question,\\
461 - but will you please sing\\
462 - at our benefit tonight?\\
463 - No.\\
464 - Oh, please.\\
465 - No.\\
466 - I'll be in such a mess.\\
467 - I told all the women...\\
468 - Wait a minute, wait a minute, I got
an idea.\\
469 - Okay, I'll do it.\\
470 - Good.\\
471 - You two skedaddle.\\
472 - I have a little studying to do.\\
473 - Oh, come on, Fred.
Let's leave her while she's...\\
474 - All right, all right.\\
475 - Tap, tap, tap.\\
476 - Oh, thank you, Mrs. Thompson, thank
you.\\
477 - And now, club members and guests\\
478 - comes the piece de resistance--\\
479 - that means the best part of the
evening--\\
480 - Mr. And Mrs. Ricky Ricardo in "Songs
and Witty Sayings."\\
481 - We'll build a bungalow big enough for
two\\
482 - Big enough for two\\
483 - My honey!\\
484 - Yes, me and you\\
485 - Ha, ha, ha, ha\\
486 - And when we're married\\
487 - Happy we'll be...\\
488 - Under the bamboo...\\
489 - Underneath the bamboo tree.\\
490 - Say, Lucy?\\
491 - Yeah, Ricky.\\
492 - You know, a funny thing happened to
me\\
493 - on the way to the theater tonight.\\
494 - What?\\
495 - A tramp came up to me in the street\\
496 - and said he hadn't had a bite in
weeks.\\
497 - What'd you do, bite him?\\
498 - If... you'd... be...\\
499 - M-i-n-e, mine, I'll be t-h-i-n-e,
thine\\
500 - And I'll l-o-v-e, love you all the
t-i-m-e, time.\\
501 - Say, Lucy?\\
502 - Yeah, Ricky.\\
503 - Did you hear about the big fire\\
504 - down in the shoe factory?\\
505 - I'll bet some heel started it.\\
506 - You're supposed to say, "what
happened?"\\
507 - Huh?\\
508 - "What happened?"\\
509 - 200 soles were lost!\\
510 - You...
are... the...\\
511 - B-e-s-t, best of all r-e-s-t, rest\\
512 - And I'll l-o-v-e, love you\\
513 - All the t-i-m-e, time.\\
514 - Go ahead.\\
515 - I'm onto your tricks.\\
516 - You start it this time.
Go ahead.\\
517 - Okay.\\
518 - You know, there are two things\\
519 - that I can't eat for breakfast--\\
520 - lunch and dinner.\\
521 - We'll...
have... an...\\
522 - L-a-r-k, lark up in the p-a-r-k, park\\
523 - And I'll k-i-s-s, kiss you in the
d-a-r-k, dark.\\
524 - Go ahead.\\
525 - I got you this time.\\
526 - I got a joke that you never heard in
your whole life.\\
527 - Okay, go ahead, spill it, brother.\\
528 - Did you hear about the girl that was
so dumb\\
529 - that she thought a football coach had
four wheels?\\
530 - Ha, ha, ha--\\
531 - four wheels!\\
532 - How many wheels does it have?\\
533 - Oh, what's the use.\\
534 - And when we're married, happy we'll
be\\
535 - Under the bamboo...\\
536 - Under the bamboo...\\
537 - Under the bamboo tree.
\subsection {Episode 14: The Amateur Hour (1952)}
1 - Oh...\\
2 - Oh, brother, am I beat.\\
3 - Well, what a sale, huh?\\
4 - Oh, these little piggies\\
5 - may never go to market again.\\
6 - Wouldn't you know I wouldn't be able
to find anything\\
7 - and you got the cutest dress in town.\\
8 - Truthfully, Ethel, isn't this\\
9 - the biggest bargain you've ever seen?\\
10 - Absolutely.\\
11 - Oh... course, now it's a question\\
12 - of how to get Ricky to let me keep
it.\\
13 - Oh, he'll have to let you keep it.\\
14 - You got it at a sale; they won't take
it back.\\
15 - Yeah, well, that's the gamble I'm
taking.\\
16 - I have to get Ricky to say that I can
keep it\\
17 - without letting him know that even if
he says I can't keep it,\\
18 - I'll have to keep it because the
store\\
19 - will make me keep it anyway.\\
20 - Well, that ought to confuse him
enough.\\
21 - Oh, I guess I'll be able to smooch
him into it.\\
22 - Sure.\\
23 - Well, I'll just get this out of his
sight\\
24 - until I get him good and mellow\\
25 - and then I'll spring it on him.\\
26 - Well, I guess I'll go down and smooch
Fred\\
27 - and see if I can talk him into
letting me keep this.\\
28 - So long, Lucy.\\
29 - Good-bye, dear.\\

142 - unless you can do something.\\
143 - Yeah, how about that?\\
144 - Well, good-bye, fellow worker.\\
145 - Good-bye.\\
146 - Oh, listen, honey, I won't be home\\

157 - I'm going to get a job.\\
158 - Job? You? Ha!\\
159 - Well, you don't have to get nasty
about it.\\
160 - There's a lot of things in here that
I can do.\\
161 - What, for instance?\\
162 - Well, I could be a...\\
163 - um...\\
164 - Well, I could...\\
165 - I could be a baby-sitter.\\
166 - Yeah.\\
167 - 50 cents an hour.\\
168 - Oh...\\
169 - Gee, it's disgusting the measly wages\\
170 - they pay baby-sitters.\\
171 - At that rate it would take you\\
172 - a year to pay for that dress.\\
173 - Look at that-- "Baby-sitter, 50 cents
an hour.\\
174 - "Baby-sitter, 50 cents an hour.\\
175 - "Baby-sitter, $50 an...\\
176 - Five dollars an hour!"\\
177 - Oh, that must be a misprint.\\
178 - No, it isn't, right there--\\
179 - "Baby-sitter, five dollars an hour."\\
180 - I'm going to call up and see if
that's right.\\
181 - Susquehanna seven...\\
182 - Listen, Lucy, if they're willing to
pay\\
183 - five dollars an hour for a
baby-sitter,\\
184 - there's a catch in it someplace.\\
185 - I don't care.\\
186 - I wonder what kind of a baby it could
be?\\
187 - Listen, for five dollars an hour\\
188 - I'll sit with a baby gorilla.\\
189 - Hello?\\
190 - Hello, I'm calling about your ad in
the paper.\\
191 - Five dollars an hour for
baby-sitting,\\
192 - is that correct?\\
193 - Well, why do you pay so much?\\
194 - I mean, what kind of a baby is it?\\
195 - A little boy.\\
196 - A little boy what?\\
197 - I mean, is it human?\\
198 - What is it?\\
199 - It's all right, it's just a little
boy.\\
200 - There's something fishy!\\
201 - Yes, yes, yes, you can bring him
around this afternoon.\\
202 - The name is Mrs. Ricardo, 623 east
68th street.\\
203 - About 2:00?\\
204 - Fine.\\

206 - Just think, Ethel, if she leaves him
here\\
207 - four hours this afternoon, I'll make
$20.\\
208 - If you're still alive.\\
209 - Oh, don't be so pessimistic.\\
210 - It's just a little boy.\\
211 - Now, what do you think\\
212 - I better have ready for him when he
gets here?\\
213 - A little girl.\\
214 - Mrs. Ricardo?\\
215 - Mrs. Hudson?\\
216 - Yes.
Oh, come in, please.\\

69 - I guess I'll be running along.\\
70 - Toodle-oo!\\
71 - Good-bye, dear.\\
72 - Toodle-oo.\\
73 - What's on Grandma Lewis's mind?\\
74 - Listen, don't let Grandma Lewis fool
you.\\
75 - Yes, sir.\\
76 - You never know what's in a box by the
wrapper.\\
77 - Well, really, I didn't even look at
her wrapper.\\
78 - I didn't mean that.\\
79 - It's just an expression.\\
80 - It means just because there isn't any
fire on her roof\\
81 - that there is no snow in her furnace.\\
82 - What?\\
83 - Sounded better when she said it.\\
84 - Yeah.\\
85 - Honestly, Ricky, it's the cutest
thing.\\
86 - Miss Lewis has a crush on Mr. Ritter.\\
87 - Mr. Ritter?
Yeah.\\
88 - The grocery man?
Yeah.\\
89 - And she is so bashful\\
90 - that she doesn't want to ask him up
to supper,\\
91 - so I'm going to give him the
invitation for her.\\
92 - Uh-huh. Give it to me, nosy.\\
93 - Nosy? What are you talking about?\\
94 - You know what I'm talking about.\\
95 - How many times have I told you\\
96 - not to get involved in other people's
lives?\\
97 - But I'm just trying to help a sweet
old lady.\\
98 - They might even get married, and then
they'll thank me.\\
99 - Yeah, she'll thank you; he'll sue
you.\\
100 - Well, is that the way you feel about
marriage?\\
101 - Oh, honey, of course not.\\
102 - I think marriage is wonderful.\\
103 - Why, I think marriage is the greatest
thing there is\\
104 - in the whole world.\\
105 - It's the only way to live.\\
106 - But if the guy has been clever enough
to escape it this long\\
107 - why louse him up now?\\
108 - What?\\
109 - Honey, I didn't mean...\\
110 - I suppose you weren't clever enough.\\
111 - Well... Well, honey, now...
I mean, uh...\\
112 - Well, I could have been clever
enough,\\
113 - but you were so cute, I decided to
play dumb.\\
114 - Well, all right, then, it's all
settled.\\
115 - I'll give this invitation to Mr.
Ritter.\\
116 - It's all settled; you'll do nothing
of the kind.\\
117 - What do you mean?\\
118 - Are you going to give that invitation
back\\
119 - to Mrs. Lewis or not?\\
120 - No!\\
121 - Lucy, if you're going to act like a
child,\\
122 - I'm going to have to treat you like
one.\\
123 - Meaning what?\\
124 - Meaning I'll put you over my knees...\\
125 - You wouldn't dare!\\
126 - Oh, I wouldn't?\\
127 - No, you wouldn't!\\
128 - Ricky, Ricky!
Come here.\\
129 - Ricky, Ricky, Ricky!\\
130 - Are you going to do what I say?\\
131 - Oh, yes!\\
132 - All right.\\
133 - Oh, Ricky!\\
134 - Oh, come in.\\
135 - Oh, Mrs. Ricardo!\\
136 - Hello, Miss Lewis.\\
137 - I was just ironing the dress I'm
going to wear tonight.\\
138 - Yeah, well, that's what I came down
to talk to you about.\\
139 - This isn't really the one that I
wanted to wear at all.\\
140 - I wanted to wear my good one,\\
141 - but it's in my hope chest and the
lock is rusted shut.\\
142 - Oh. Well, it really won't make any
difference because I'm...\\
143 - Oh, of course it doesn't.\\
144 - Sit down, dear.\\
145 - No, I don't think I care to sit down.\\
146 - Well, let me show you, here.\\
147 - Now, look, I thought that we'd eat by
candlelight,\\
148 - because they say it makes you look
younger.\\
149 - Oh, yes, that's right.\\
150 - Maybe I'll look like a girl of 50
again, huh?\\
151 - Oh, easily.\\
152 - Oh, you're sweet, you're awfully
sweet.\\
153 - Look.\\
154 - Elderberry wine-- I made it myself.\\
155 - It's been fermenting since I was 21
years old.\\
156 - Twenty-one?\\
157 - Must have quite a tang by now.\\
158 - I thought Mr. Ritter and I could have\\
159 - a couple of belts before dinner.\\
160 - Well, I don't think you're going to
get\\
161 - much chance to serve it, Miss Lewis.\\
162 - You see, I had a long talk with my
husband...\\
163 - Oh, husband!\\
164 - That's the most beautiful word in the
English language.\\
165 - Miss Lewis!\\
166 - Don't forget... the invitation!\\
167 - I wanted to talk to you about that...\\
168 - Pretty late today, and I'm awful
sorry,\\
169 - but I want to tell you something.\\
170 - The traffic has been something awful.\\
171 - Oh, Mrs. Ricardo, howdy, howdy!\\
172 - Awful cold out-- it's awful cold,
really.\\
173 - How are you?\\
174 - Fine.\\
175 - How are you?\\
176 - Me, I can't kick-- rheumatism.\\
177 - Get it?\\
178 - I don't know how I think of them.\\
179 - Just like that, you know, comical.\\
180 - Where is, uh, where is Miss Lewis?\\
181 - Well, she ought to be back in a
minute.\\
182 - Well, she can, uh...\\
183 - She can pay me for these when I come
the next time.\\
184 - Okay.\\
185 - Mr. Ritter?\\
186 - Huh?\\
187 - Come here.\\
188 - I have a secret to tell you.\\
189 - Uh...\\
190 - Someone around here is very fond of
you.\\
191 - No!\\
192 - Yes, a certain someone thinks\\
193 - that you're the bee's knees.\\
194 - Well, hot diggity!\\
195 - You want to know something, Mrs.
Ricardo?\\
196 - What?\\
197 - I like you, too.\\
198 - What?\\
199 - You're just my type, Red.\\
200 - Oh, no, no, you don't understand.\\
201 - Here, read this.
This will explain.\\
202 - "Can you make it for dinner tonight,
just the two of us?"\\
203 - Uh-oh.\\
204 - "Will be waiting for you in my
apartment."\\
205 - Can I make it?\\
206 - Say, speed's my middle name, Lucy.\\
207 - Oh, now, now, stay away!\\
208 - I didn't write that note.
Miss Lewis did.\\
209 - Miss Lewis? Aw, who are you joshing?\\
210 - No, really, look at the signature.\\
211 - It says...
"Your secret lover."\\
212 - Secret lover?\\
213 - You don't have to keep anything
secret from me, lover.\\
214 - No! Miss Lewis!
Miss Lewis!\\
215 - Now, listen, you're not fooling
anybody.\\
216 - She's not here, you said so yourself.\\
217 - Don't try to fight this, Lucy.\\
218 - It's bigger than both of us.\\
219 - It is not!\\
220 - Miss Lewis, Miss Lewis, where are
you?\\
221 - Miss Lewis!\\
222 - See, alone. I tell you it's fate,
really.\\
223 - But she was here, honest.\\
224 - Sure, she was, sure.\\
225 - You know you're even cuter when you
get shy like this.\\
226 - Mr. Ritter!\\
227 - Don't worry about anything--\\
228 - your apartment, dinner, tonight,
sure.\\
229 - I'm afraid I can't make it till about
half past 7:00.\\
230 - Mr. Ritter!\\
231 - Oh, honey, I got to keep the store
open till 7:00, honest.\\
232 - Mr. Ritter!\\
233 - Oh, Miss Lewis, where have you been?\\
234 - I've been calling you for hours.\\
235 - Oh, Mrs. Ricardo, I just lost control
of myself.\\
236 - When I found out that Mr. Ritter
thought\\
237 - you were inviting him to dinner,\\
238 - I got hysterical and started running.\\
239 - Ran eight laps around the park.\\
240 - Passed lots of horses.\\
241 - Oh...\\
242 - I'm pooped.\\
243 - Well, you certainly got me in a fine
mess.\\
244 - Your secret lover is coming here for
dinner at 7:30\\
245 - and my husband is due home at the
same time.\\
246 - Oh... well, why don't you call him\\
247 - and tell him your husband's going to
be here?\\
248 - I did-- he was delighted.\\
249 - He wants to tell Ricky that we love
each other\\
250 - and that he should start getting a
divorce right away.\\
251 - Oh... oh, I wish there was some way I
could help.\\
252 - There is.\\
253 - What?\\
254 - You stay on those stairs tonight\\
255 - and don't let Mr. Ritter get into
this apartment.\\
256 - You get him into your apartment.\\
257 - How?\\
258 - I don't know how you're going to do
it, but you do it.\\
259 - Mrs. Ricardo?\\
260 - What?\\
261 - Would you teach me how to attract the
opposite...\\
262 - sex?\\
263 - Well, all right.\\
264 - Stand up, let's have a look at you.\\
265 - Well...\\
266 - um, let's see you walk back and forth\\
267 - and swing your hips.\\
268 - Swing my hips?\\
269 - Yes.\\
270 - Oh, no, no, no, no.\\
271 - All that will get you\\
272 - is a Boy Scout to help you across the
street.\\
273 - Look, now, watch me.\\
274 - You just shift them gently.\\
275 - Shift, shift, shift\\
276 - shift, shift...\\
277 - Shift them?\\
278 - That's easy for you.\\
279 - I've got a rusty transmission.\\
280 - I'm sorry.\\
281 - Maybe we could try a "come hither"
look.\\
282 - Yeah.\\
283 - Miss Lewis, what's the matter?\\
284 - Are you all right?\\
285 - What's the matter?\\
286 - There's nothing the matter.\\
287 - That's my "come hither" look.\\
288 - Oh.\\
289 - Oh, no, dear, try something like
this.\\
290 - Oh, dear.\\
291 - Oh, excuse me.\\
292 - Hello.\\
293 - Yes, dear?\\
294 - It's Ricky.\\
295 - Honey, I won't be home tonight for
dinner.\\
296 - Oh?\\
297 - No, I have to stay in town.\\
298 - Jerry and I are going to talk some
business.\\
299 - Oh, well, all right, dear.\\
300 - Don't be too lonesome.\\
301 - Oh, no, no, I won't.\\
302 - Good-bye.\\
303 - Ricky isn't coming home to dinner.\\
304 - You know, I just think\\
305 - I might keep that date with Mr.
Ritter tonight.\\
306 - That's not fair.\\
307 - He's mine.\\
308 - Oh, you don't understand, dear.\\
309 - I'm going to get him up here\\
310 - and disappoint him so completely\\
311 - that he wouldn't have me on a silver
platter.\\
312 - Then the road will be nice and clear
for you.\\
313 - Oh, oh, fine, fine.\\
314 - Let's see now, how can I disappoint
Mr. Ritter?\\
315 - What do you know about him?\\
316 - Well, we had a long conversation once
over the pickle barrel.\\
317 - That sort of raised my hopes.\\
318 - Um...\\
319 - he can't stand children.\\
320 - And he likes a tidy appearance,\\
321 - and he demands immaculate
housekeeping.\\
322 - He likes good cooking...\\
323 - Hold it, hold it.\\
324 - I think I can change Mr. Ritter's
heartthrob\\
325 - to heartburn in one sitting.\\
326 - Well, Mr. Ritter!\\
327 - How are you tonight?\\
328 - You ask that at a time like this?\\
329 - Oh, for me?\\
330 - Uh-huh, the whole bag.\\
331 - Oh, thank you.\\
332 - Oh, gumdrops!\\
333 - Thank you.\\
334 - Can I take your coat off?\\
335 - Please.\\
336 - There we are.\\
337 - Hat?\\
338 - Oh.\\
339 - Just a minute.\\
340 - What's that?\\
341 - Oh!\\
342 - Well, sit down; dinner's almost
ready.\\
343 - Yeah, that's right.\\
344 - I'm very anxious for you to sample my
cooking.\\
345 - So am I.\\
346 - Oh! Oh! Pardon me.\\
347 - Oh, I'm so sorry.\\
348 - There we are.\\
349 - Well, I hope you like tomato juice.\\
350 - Oh, I do, I like it very much.\\
351 - Yeah, this, huh?
Yeah.\\
352 - This is our special every Thursday
down at my store.\\
353 - Oh, is that so?\\
354 - Yeah, yes.\\
355 - Well, the same brand it is, yes,
sure.\\
356 - Is that so?\\
357 - Well, here's...
uh, what is it now?\\
358 - Here's mud in your eye.
Oh!\\
359 - Of course, it ain't mud;\\
360 - it's really tomato juice.\\
361 - Yeah. You know, I put the tiniest
dash of Tabasco in this.\\
362 - Inside?\\
363 - Yeah.\\
364 - Yes, it helps, you know, everything,
you know...\\
365 - Just right, huh?\\
366 - Oh, fine...\\
367 - Want some more?\\
368 - No, something to chew on, like a
piece of bread.\\
369 - Oh, I have some nice, fluffy
biscuits.\\
370 - Oh, I'm crazy about...\\
371 - Hurry, will you, hurry!\\
372 - Oh!\\
373 - Well, a little dirt never hurt
anybody.\\
374 - No, really, I don't think I care for
biscuits.\\
375 - Oh, no?\\
376 - No.\\
377 - Well, I hope you like soup.\\
378 - That's what's coming up next.\\
379 - Soup, yes.
Soothing soup.\\
380 - Yeah, hot.\\
381 - There you are.\\
382 - Mmm...\\
383 - Mine's too hot.\\
384 - It's always too hot for me.\\
385 - Want some more?\\
386 - I'm not really much of a soup eater.\\
387 - You're not?\\
388 - Why not?\\
389 - A throat condition.\\
390 - Oh.\\
391 - You know, you have a very finicky
appetite.\\
392 - No, I'm pretty rugged as a rule,
pretty rugged.\\
393 - You like roast turkey with sage
dressing?\\
394 - I love it, yes-- dark meat, you know.\\
395 - Nice and juicy, huh?\\
396 - Well, we're not having that tonight.\\
397 - How about pot roast and...\\
398 - Oh, with the pancake, huh?\\
399 - Potato pancakes, apple sauce.\\
400 - Oh, my. I had a banquet once...\\
401 - We're not having that tonight either.\\
402 - We're having steak.\\
403 - Steak?
Yeah.\\
404 - Oh, steak.
Yeah.\\
405 - Oh, haven't had it for months.\\
406 - We have them down at my store, but I
can't afford to buy them.\\
407 - Well, here we are, nice, sizzling
steak.\\
408 - Hang on to this, will you?\\
409 - Oh, I don't think...\\
410 - Oh, go ahead, I won't hurt you.\\
411 - Come on, hang on.\\
412 - Attaboy.\\
413 - There we are.\\
414 - Oop!\\
415 - Sorry, I lose more friends that way.\\
416 - Well, here we are.\\
417 - Gesundheit.\\
418 - Lucy?\\
419 - Yeah?
You know something?\\
420 - What?\\
421 - I'm not hungry.\\
422 - You're not?\\
423 - I'm not hungry.\\
424 - You don't like my cooking.
No...\\
425 - You're disappointed in me.\\
426 - You're going away and you're never
coming back.\\
427 - I am not!\\
428 - Lucy, I'll never leave you, never.\\
429 - You won't?\\
430 - What's food compared to the
fundamental principles?\\
431 - We love each other; that's all that
counts.\\
432 - Now, I'm going to do all the cooking
until you learn how.\\
433 - The important thing is...\\
434 - Quiet, you're waking the children.\\
435 - Don't stop me. The important thing
is...\\
436 - The what?\\
437 - The children.\\
438 - You haven't any children.\\
439 - Oh, yes, I have.\\
440 - You never told me.
I've never seen one...\\
441 - I keep them hidden.\\
442 - They don't like kids in this
apartment house.\\
443 - You mean to tell me that you're the
mother\\
444 - of these lollipop-eating,\\
445 - sticky-fingered, candy-stealing...\\
446 - That's right, and if you're not going
to eat your dinner,\\
447 - I'm going to have to give it to the
kids.\\
448 - I can't eat that.\\
449 - All right, children, come and get it!\\
450 - Come and get it!\\
451 - Oh, oh, oh, Mr. Ricardo?\\
452 - Yes, Miss Lewis?\\
453 - Mr. Ricardo, could I see you for a
minute?\\
454 - Why, sure, Miss Lewis.\\
455 - Yes, yes, it's, um...\\
456 - Oh, it's a nice evening, isn't it?\\
457 - Yes, lovely, if you like it below
zero.\\
458 - Oh, below zero.\\
459 - Well, um...\\
460 - uh... is...\\
461 - Miss Lewis, if there's nothing else
on your mind,\\
462 - I'm anxious to get upstairs.\\
463 - Oh...\\
464 - Miss Lewis, are you having an attack?\\
465 - Razz-a-matazz.\\
466 - Razz-a... razz-a-matazz...\\
467 - I'll see you later.\\
468 - No, no, no!\\
469 - You can't go up there until Mr.
Ritter leaves.\\
470 - What?!\\
471 - Did Lucy give him that invitation?\\
472 - Oh...\\
473 - Yes, poor dear, and he thought it was
from her,\\
474 - and now he wants to marry her.\\
475 - He wants to...\\
476 - She's... she's...\\
477 - she's upstairs now trying to
discourage him.\\
478 - She is?\\
479 - Oh, this is great, this is wonderful.\\
480 - I'll see you later, good-bye.\\
481 - Oh, Mr. Ricardo...\\
482 - Yes, yes, dear?\\
483 - You're the first man I ever flirted
with,\\
484 - and do you want to know something?\\
485 - What?\\
486 - I like it.\\
487 - Well, I think you're very cute.\\
488 - I'll see you later.\\
489 - Twenty-two...\\
490 - twenty-three...\\
491 - twenty-four...\\
492 - Twenty-four and a half.\\
493 - You know, Lucy, that's an awful lot
of children.\\
494 - Six of them are missing.\\
495 - Missing?\\
496 - Yeah. Well, now you know.\\
497 - Go ahead and leave me.\\
498 - I wouldn't blame you.\\
499 - Lucy, you know that I hate kids.\\
500 - Yeah?\\
501 - I can't stand bad housekeeping...
Yeah.\\
502 - and sloppy food.
Yeah.\\
503 - But when a guy has got a chickadee
like you\\
504 - nothing else really matters.\\
505 - Come to me, baby!\\
506 - No, now, Mr. Ritter!\\
507 - Hi, Lucy.\\
508 - Hello, Mr. Ritter.\\
509 - What's new?\\
510 - What's new?!\\
511 - Mr. Ricardo, there's something you
ought to know.\\
512 - Your wife and I love each other.\\
513 - No!\\
514 - No, Ricky, let me explain.\\
515 - Well, honey, there's nothing to
explain.\\
516 - I've been expecting this for some
time.\\
517 - You been "specting" what?\\
518 - Well, I can't possibly hope to keep\\
519 - such a glorious hunk of stuff like
you\\
520 - all to myself forever.\\
521 - Of course not.\\
522 - I pass her on to you.\\
523 - And you pass her into waiting hands.\\
524 - Wait a minute.\\
525 - Can the football say something?\\
526 - Mr. Ritter, please be good to her.\\
527 - She'll make a wonderful wife.\\
528 - Ricardo, you're a good scout.\\
529 - I'm going to send you a whole case of
lima beans.\\
530 - And don't you worry about Lucy,\\
531 - and don't you worry about those
children.\\
532 - What children?\\
533 - Say, you really hid those kids,
didn't you?\\
534 - Now, Ricky, listen...\\
535 - Honey, please, please don't say
another word.\\
536 - Just stand there like you are.\\
537 - I want to remember you like this
forever.\\
538 - Good-bye-- I'll pack my things.\\
539 - Ricky!\\
540 - Don't worry about him, don't-- you
got me.\\
541 - Oh, wait a minute, leave me alone!\\
542 - At last, at last you're altogether
mine.\\
543 - Mr. Ritter!\\
544 - What's the matter?\\
545 - What's the matter with you?\\
546 - Lover boy!

1 - Ricky!\\
2 - Ricky!\\
3 - Ricky!\\
4 - He isn't home yet.\\
5 - Oh!\\
6 - And what is this, Ethel?\\
7 - It's the third time today\\
8 - you've been up here asking for Ricky.\\
9 - Well, Fred and I want to talk to him
about his ad in Variety.\\
10 - Ethel...
Ad in Variety?
Uh-huh.\\
11 - See you later, Lucy.
We got to go.\\
12 - Ethel, what is it?\\
13 - Come on, Ethel.
Ethel, tell me.\\
14 - Come on!
Ethel!\\
15 - Wait a minute!\\
16 - One of you let go\\
17 - or I'm going to have a split
personality.\\
18 - All right, Ethel, let's have it.\\
19 - Well?
Well, as long as you've opened your
big bazoo\\
20 - you might as well tell her the whole
thing.\\
21 - All right.\\
22 - You see, it's this way.\\
23 - We saw Ricky's ad in Variety.\\
24 - Ricky's ad?
What's it for?\\
25 - He's looking for new acts for his
show down at the club.\\
26 - I didn't see that.\\
27 - Where's our Variety?\\
28 - Here it is.\\
29 - It's inside the back page, I think.\\
30 - Oh.\\
31 - How do you like that?\\
32 - He cut it out.\\
33 - He told me there was\\
34 - a recipe in here he wanted to save.\\
35 - He's a slick one, all right.\\
36 - He'd do anything to keep you from
going in show business.\\
37 - Yeah, well, what kind of acts does
Tricky Ricky need?\\
38 - Well, he needs a dance team.\\
39 - That's where Fred and I come in.\\
40 - Yeah, anywhere where I come in?\\
41 - Well, he needs a good dog act.\\
42 - Well, thanks a lot.\\
43 - Fred Mertz!\\
44 - And the ad said he needed a beautiful
showgirl, too.\\
45 - That's me!
Sure.\\
46 - Hey, looks like there's a spot\\
47 - for all of us in his show.
Yeah.\\
48 - And this time, we're not going to let
him\\
49 - talk us out of it...
No.\\
50 - Not for one minute.\\
51 - Hi, everybody.\\
52 - What's going on here?\\
53 - We're answering your recipe in
Variety.\\
54 - Oh, so that's it, huh?
Yeah.\\
55 - Yeah, that's it.\\
56 - Give us a chance\\
57 - to show you our routine, will you,
Rick?\\
58 - Come on, you might...
you might like it\\
59 - if you give us a chance to show it to
you.\\
60 - Ricky!\\
61 - Thanks for coming down, folks.\\
62 - And don't call us, we'll call you.\\
63 - Ricky, you open this door!\\
64 - I'm sorry, but the casting office is
closed for the day.\\
65 - Ricky Ricardo, you open this door!\\
66 - Who wants to come in--\\
67 - two dancers and a showgirl or the
Mertzes and my wife?\\
68 - Well, you better make up your mind.\\
69 - Who is going to be?\\
70 - Hold it. Hold it.\\
71 - Hold it!\\
72 - What?\\
73 - Now, wait a minute.\\
74 - Now, Ricky, before you say no, take a
good look at us.\\
75 - Look at the Mertzes; they're
wonderful dancers.\\
76 - The least you could do is give them
an audition.\\
77 - Tah-dah!\\
78 - All right, all right, they can come
down and audition\\
79 - but you're not going to get any more
consideration\\
80 - than anyone else.\\
81 - Oh, fine, Ricky.
Good enough.\\
82 - All right. Now that that's all
settled\\
83 - how about a little game of cards, eh?\\
84 - Well, Ricky, what about me?\\
85 - Oh, you can play, too.\\
86 - No, no, I mean you're giving Fred and
Ethel their chance.\\
87 - Haven't you got a place for me in the
show?\\
88 - Why, sure, honey.
I got just the place for you.\\
89 - Where?
Out front, in the audience.\\
90 - Oh, you.\\
91 - Ricky, I think you're being mean.\\
92 - If you keep Lucy from doing what she
wants to do\\
93 - she'll develop some sort of a
complex.\\
94 - Yeah.\\
95 - She might become depressed.\\
96 - Yeah.\\
97 - She might even go off her trolley.\\
98 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
99 - Thank you, Dr. Mertz.\\
100 - Now, what is it going to be-- bridge
or canasta?\\
101 - Oh, Ricky, you make me so mad.\\
102 - Now, we're going to have this out
right now.\\
103 - You're never going to let me be in
your show, are you?\\
104 - Never! Never! Never!\\
105 - Now, honey, don't be so upset.\\
106 - Who knows?\\
107 - Maybe some day in the far, distant
future\\
108 - you may get your chance.\\
109 - Where?\\
110 - In that big nightclub up yonder?\\
111 - I can see it now--\\
112 - Ricky Ricardo and his Heavenly Revue\\
113 - starring Lucy and her magic harp.\\
114 - Good morning, Lucy.\\
115 - Hi.\\
116 - Pour yourself a cup of coffee.\\
117 - Thanks, I will.\\
118 - Why don't you sit down?\\
119 - Don't mind if I do.\\
120 - Help yourself to a cookie.\\
121 - No, thanks, I'm not hungry.\\
122 - What are you reading?\\
123 - Listen, do you remember last night
when you told Ricky\\
124 - that if I didn't get into show
business\\
125 - I might develop some sort of a
complex?\\
126 - Yeah.
Well, you were right.\\
127 - Yeah?
I got this book at the library\\
128 - and it says anybody who is constantly
frustrated\\
129 - may do all sorts of things.\\
130 - So?\\
131 - So, look.\\
132 - Abnormal Psychology.\\
133 - Yeah, I'm learning to act abnormal.\\
134 - For this, you need a book?\\
135 - I thought you were on my side.\\
136 - I am, but I was just making all that
stuff up\\
137 - as I went along last night.\\
138 - I don't really know anything about
it.\\
139 - Oh, yes, you do.
Listen to this.\\
140 - "A person who is kept\\
141 - "may manifest this frustration\\
142 - "in the following ways:\\
143 - "One, he may assume the
characteristics\\
144 - of the person he is kept from
becoming."\\
145 - Now, you know Ricky's kept me from
becoming a famous actress.\\
146 - Uh-huh.\\
147 - "Two, he may develop amnesia."\\
148 - Uh-huh.\\
149 - "Three, he may withdraw from reality\\
150 - and become childlike again."\\
151 - Gee, what a keen bunch of complexes.\\
152 - Which one of them\\
153 - are you going to have?\\
154 - Which one? I'm going to have all
three of them.\\
155 - All three of them?\\
156 - Certainly.\\
157 - Well, this, I got to see.\\
158 - Lucy!\\
159 - I'm home!\\
160 - Hello, darling.\\
161 - Hello.\\
162 - How'd things go at rehearsal,
darling?\\
163 - Fine.\\
164 - How'd things go here at home?\\
165 - Oh, frightful, darling.\\
166 - The phone woke me at the crack of
noon.\\
167 - Noel called.\\
168 - We chatted till 1:00, I bathed till
2:00\\
169 - turned down scripts until 3:00.\\
170 - Then Noel darling sent me the most
darling present.\\
171 - Oh, yes, it was a darling Cadillac.\\
172 - You should really see it, darling,
it's darling.\\
173 - What is this?\\
174 - What's what, darling?\\
175 - Why don't you cut it out and be
yourself, huh?\\
176 - I'd be happy to be myself if I could
remember who I am.\\
177 - Who am I?\\
178 - Who are you?\\
179 - Well, don't you know either, buster?\\
180 - Buster?\\
181 - What kind of a gag is this?\\
182 - Now, Lucy, what are you trying to do?\\
183 - Lucy... is that my name?\\
184 - Well, it was when I left here this
morning.\\
185 - Oh, do you live here, too?\\
186 - I have for the past five years.\\
187 - Oh, we better get married.\\
188 - We are married.\\
189 - Ha!\\
190 - You say that, but how do I know that
it's true?\\
191 - Honey, what are you talking about?\\
192 - You stay away from me, fresh.\\
193 - Fresh?\\
194 - I was told never to talk to strange
men.\\
195 - My mother told me...\\
196 - whoever she is.\\
197 - Honey, are you sure you're well?\\
198 - No, I'm not.\\
199 - Could it possibly be\\
200 - that you're suffering from magnesia?\\
201 - Amnesia!\\
202 - Oh, who am I?\\
203 - What am I?\\
204 - Where am I?\\
205 - Oh, honey...
Look, honey.
Look around you.\\
206 - Doesn't this place look familiar to
you?\\
207 - No.\\
208 - No.\\
209 - No.\\
210 - No.\\
211 - No.\\
212 - Oh!\\
213 - No.\\
214 - Oh, honey, now, come on, try to
think.\\
215 - Honey, look...\\
216 - Oh, oh, honey, come here.\\
217 - Where?
Look. Look there. Look.\\
218 - Do you remember this picture?
I gave it to you.\\
219 - Oh, she's pretty.\\
220 - Who is she?\\
221 - Honey, I think you're really sick.\\
222 - May-May-Maybe you better go and lie
down, huh?\\
223 - All right, I'll go lie down.\\
224 - Yeah.\\
225 - Tha-That's not the bedroom, dear.\\
226 - Oh.\\
227 - That's not, either.\\
228 - Oh.\\
229 - No, honey, over...\\
230 - Honey, over here.
That's where the bedroom is.\\
231 - Oh.
Right here, honey.\\
232 - Oh.
Now, you take it easy, honey.\\
233 - You have a very lovely apartment
here, mister.\\
234 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
235 - Hello.\\
236 - Hello, is Dr. Stevenson in?\\
237 - Oh.\\
238 - Well, look, please-please tell him to
call me\\
239 - as soon as he gets in.\\
240 - Oh, this is Ricky Ricardo.\\
241 - Yes.\\
242 - It's about my wife.\\
243 - She's acting peculiar.\\
244 - Yeah, I know, I know.\\
245 - Well, this time it's even worse.\\
246 - What?\\
247 - Oh, I see.\\
248 - I should humor her until-until the
doctor calls me.\\
249 - All right, all right, I'll humor her.\\
250 - Yes.\\
251 - Bye.\\
252 - Hi!\\
253 - Hi!\\
254 - You want to play with me, little boy?\\
255 - Will you?
Huh? Huh? Huh?\\
256 - Yeah, sure, sure, I'll play with you.\\
257 - Take a lick of my sucker.\\
258 - Go on.\\
259 - Take a big lick.\\
260 - Go on.\\
261 - That's enough.\\
262 - You want to play games, little boy?\\
263 - Sure, yeah, I'll play a game with
you.\\
264 - Okay, I'll be the leader.
You stay where you are.\\
265 - You want to play "May I?"\\
266 - Yeah, whatever you say.\\
267 - All right.
Okay, you stay right there, now.\\
268 - I won't, no.
Don't you go away.\\
269 - Okay, you take two giant steps.\\
270 - All right.\\
271 - May I?\\
272 - No!\\
273 - I want you to take me for a ride.\\
274 - All right.\\
275 - On my tricycle.\\
276 - Now, wait a minute...\\
277 - On my tricycle!
On my tricycle!\\
278 - All right.\\
279 - All right.\\
280 - All right, on the tricycle.\\
281 - All right.
I'll take you.\\
282 - I'll take you.
On the tricycle.\\
283 - All right.\\
284 - On the tricycle, I'll take you for a
ride.\\
285 - Whee! Whee!
Ring the bell!\\
286 - Ring the bell!
Ring the bell!\\
287 - Toot the horn!
Toot the horn!\\
288 - Toot the horn!
All right!\\
289 - No eyes! No eyes!
Toot the horn! Toot the horn!\\
290 - All right!
All right!\\
291 - You pushed me!\\
292 - Hi, Rick.\\
293 - Hello, Fred.\\
294 - How's Lucy? Does she still think
she's a child?\\
295 - Yeah.\\
296 - She's in the bedroom with Ethel.\\
297 - They're playing jacks.\\
298 - Ricky, I got to tell you something.\\
299 - Not now, Fred.
Not now; later, please.\\
300 - Lucy is faking.\\
301 - Look, Fred, we'll talk about it
later.\\
302 - The most important thing right now is
her heal...\\
303 - What do you mean, she's faking?\\
304 - I was downstairs in the basement\\
305 - listening through the furnace pipe\\
306 - and I heard everything that Lucy and
Ethel said.\\
307 - Well, why didn't you tell me before?\\
308 - It took me an hour to get my head out
of the pipe.\\
309 - Why, that little monkey.\\
310 - She'll do anything to get in the act,
won't she?\\
311 - Looks like.\\
312 - Oh, brother, I got a wonderful idea.\\
313 - I'm going to teach her a lesson she
will never forget.\\
314 - Are you phoning the doctor?\\
315 - No.\\
316 - I'm phoning an actor friend of mine,
Hal March.\\
317 - Hello.\\
318 - Hello, Hal?\\
319 - Who's this, Ricky?\\
320 - Yeah, this is Ricky.\\
321 - Listen, Hal, I got a job for you--
the part of a doctor.\\
322 - Good. What's the show?\\
323 - Well, the show is called, uh...
"Getting Even with Lucy"\\
324 - and it all takes place right here in
my apartment.\\
325 - What?\\
326 - Yes, here's the way it goes.\\
327 - Lucy's been pretending that she's
sick\\
328 - so that I'd feel sorry for her\\
329 - and give her a part in my new show.\\
330 - So I want you to come over here\\
331 - and pretend that you're a doctor,
see?\\
332 - And while you're giving her a checkup\\
333 - you will discover that she has a very
unusual condition.\\
334 - Uh... some rare tropical disease.\\
335 - Like what?\\
336 - I don't know.\\
337 - Make it up.\\
338 - Be tough to keep a straight face.\\
339 - It's an awful dirty trick, Ricky.\\
340 - Yeah, I know.\\
341 - Like they say in Mexico\\
342 - "Mi amigo, alla va el zorrillo."\\
343 - What's that mean?\\
344 - I'm a real stinker.\\
345 - What comes after twosies?\\
346 - Threesies.\\
347 - Oh, yeah.\\
348 - I'd forgotten how much fun this was.\\
349 - Yes?\\
350 - May I come in?\\
351 - Oh, yes.\\
352 - How do you feel, little girl?\\
353 - Oh, she's not at all well.\\
354 - She has a terrible fever.\\
355 - I feel fine, mister.\\
356 - I'm playing jacks.\\
357 - Oh, Ethel, it's all my fault.\\
358 - I wish she would snap out of it.\\
359 - You know, I just decided to star her
in the club.\\
360 - Ricky, that's wonderful.\\
361 - Wow, what do you know?!
She got her memory back.\\
362 - Oh, yes, I know who I am.\\
363 - I'm Lucy, and you're Ricky.\\
364 - Ethel!\\
365 - Welcome home, honey.\\
366 - Well, when do we start rehearsal?\\
367 - Now, wait a minute, honey.\\
368 - Wait a minute.\\
369 - You know, you've been very sick.\\
370 - So I asked a doctor to come over.\\
371 - A doctor?\\
372 - But I feel fine.\\
373 - Oh, no, no, no, never mind that.\\
374 - But I feel fine.\\
375 - Doctor!\\
376 - Come in, doctor.\\
377 - This is my wife Lucy, doctor.\\
378 - How do you do, Mrs. Ricardo?\\
379 - I feel fine.\\
380 - Yeah.
Yeah. Well, would you remove this,
please?\\
381 - I-I won't need that.\\
382 - Excuse me.\\
383 - Well, now...\\
384 - Oh... oh...\\
385 - I'm glad you called me in, Mr.
Ricardo.\\
386 - Pretty bad, huh?
Oh, yes.\\
387 - Now, if you'll just open your mouth,
Mrs. Ricardo\\
388 - and stick out your tongue.\\
389 - Say, "Ah." Ah.\\
390 - Ah.
Ah.\\
391 - Ah.
Ah.\\
392 - Ah.
Ah.\\
393 - Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.\\
394 - What is it, doctor?\\
395 - I don't know yet.\\
396 - Is it very bad, doctor?\\
397 - We'll have to see.\\
398 - Well, I feel fine.\\
399 - Yeah, well, I'm...\\
400 - Please, please, Mrs.
Ricardo, don't talk.\\
401 - You may need all your strength.\\
402 - Just hold that right there.\\
403 - Now, if you'll just turn around\\
404 - and give me a little cough, Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
405 - A little cough?\\
406 - Louder.\\
407 - Louder.\\
408 - Now, Mrs. Ricardo\\
409 - if you'll just give me one good
cough.\\
410 - Hmm, just as I feared.\\
411 - Oh...\\
412 - Well, what is it?\\
413 - You can tell me; I can take it.\\
414 - Frankly, Mrs. Ricardo\\
415 - you've contracted a terrible,
terrible attack\\
416 - of the go-bloots.\\
417 - Go-bloots?\\
418 - Doctor, what kind of a disease is
that?\\
419 - Well, we doctors don't know too much
about it\\
420 - but there's a terrible epidemic of it
lately.\\
421 - It seems... it seems it came into the
country\\
422 - on the hind legs of the booshoo bird.\\
423 - I got the go-bloots from a booshoo
bird?\\
424 - Ew...\\
425 - Tell me, doctor, is it very, very
serious?\\
426 - Well, Mr. Ricardo\\
427 - I may as well be honest with you.\\
428 - If it gets worse, we may have to
operate.\\
429 - Operate?\\
430 - Yes, we'll have to go in and take out
your zorch.\\
431 - My zorch?!\\
432 - There's nothing wrong with my zorch.\\
433 - Now, now, don't be alarmed, Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
434 - Some people go on for years without a
zorch.\\
435 - Well, is the operation painful?\\
436 - No, no, we anesthetize thoroughly for
a zorchectomy.\\
437 - Well, tell me, doctor, uh...\\
438 - would you be forced to remove the
entire zorch?\\
439 - Well, Mr. Ricardo, we may be very
fortunate and save half\\
440 - and as I always say\\
441 - half a zorch is better than none.\\
442 - Of course, even if I'm able to save
half\\
443 - you'll never be able to...
trummel again.\\
444 - I won't?\\
445 - Oh...\\
446 - What's trummeling?\\
447 - Well, it's an involuntary internal
process.\\
448 - Oh.\\
449 - Doctor, is there anything we can do
for her?\\
450 - All we can do is just wait.\\
451 - She should reach the crisis very
soon.\\
452 - Just wait and hope that she doesn't
turn green.\\
453 - Green!\\
454 - Yes, yes, green.\\
455 - That's the danger sign.\\
456 - Well, what happens then?\\
457 - If you turn green, a half hour
later...\\
458 - ...gone.\\
459 - Gone?\\
460 - Gone.\\
461 - Deal me out, boys.\\
462 - How's the patient?\\
463 - Did the patient got rid of the
go-bloots?\\
464 - I'm afraid not, Fred.\\
465 - She just turned green.\\
466 - Now, don't be silly.\\
467 - There's no such thing as go-bloots.\\
468 - Thanks.\\
469 - I know, I know...\\
470 - but there's such a thing as a green
light bulb.\\
471 - You didn't...\\
472 - Yes, I did.\\
473 - Oh, you rascal, you.\\
474 - I sneaked in there when she was
asleep\\
475 - and I put a green light bulb in the
lamp by her bed.\\
476 - Well, how did you keep Ethel from
finding out?\\
477 - I sent Florence Nightingale\\
478 - to the drugstore for some aspirin.\\
479 - Oh, good.\\
480 - Now, listen, when she comes back\\
481 - you better get her to bed.\\
482 - Why?\\
483 - Well, she told me that she's starting\\
484 - to feel some pains in her zorch, too.\\
485 - Oh, no, no.\\
486 - Ricky! Ricky!\\
487 - Ricky!
Come on, the fun is about to begin.\\
488 - Ricky!
I'm coming! I'm coming!\\
489 - Ricky...
What's the matter, honey?\\
490 - My hands, they're green.\\
491 - Why, they are.\\
492 - Your face is green, too.\\
493 - Oh, no! Give me the mirror, give me
the mirror.\\
494 - Oh! Oh! Oh!\\
495 - Oh, my face!\\
496 - And my hair!\\
497 - Oh... Ricky... Oh!\\
498 - Oh!\\
499 - You got the go-bloots, too.\\
500 - What are you talking about?\\
501 - You're both green.\\
502 - We are?\\
503 - No, Fred.\\
504 - She doesn't know what she's saying.\\
505 - Fred, do I look green to you?\\
506 - No.\\
507 - You don't look green to me, either.\\
508 - Oh, no.\\
509 - I'm looking at the world through
green-colored eyeballs.\\
510 - Lucy, here's your pill.\\
511 - Take one of these, and you'll...\\
512 - You're green.\\
513 - I've been sick.\\
514 - Oh... you poor little green thing.\\
515 - Oh, this is it, Ricky.\\
516 - This is it, I'm going.\\
517 - Good-bye, Ethel.\\
518 - Good-bye.\\
519 - Good-bye, Fred.\\
520 - So long, chum.\\
521 - Good-bye, Ricky.\\
522 - Now, wait a minute, honey.\\
523 - Don't go yet.\\
524 - Why not?\\
525 - Well, I asked some of the boys in the
band to come over here\\
526 - and play a farewell dirge for you.\\
527 - What'd he say?\\
528 - Some of the boys in the band came
over\\
529 - to play a farewell dirge.\\
530 - Oh.\\
531 - Well, I'll try to hang on.\\
532 - I wouldn't want them to have made the
trip for nothing.\\
533 - Good girl, good girl.\\
534 - All right, fellas!\\
535 - Fellas!\\
536 - Come in.\\
537 - All right, fellows.\\
538 - Now, please, this is the last music
that she will ever hear.\\
539 - So make it sweet.\\
540 - What kind of music was that?\\
541 - Yeah, watch it, will you, fellas? I'm
dying.\\
542 - Lucy, I have something to tell you,
honey.\\
543 - What?\\
544 - There's no such thing as the
go-bloots.\\
545 - How can you look me in my green eye
and say that?\\
546 - Well, honey, you're not green either.\\
547 - Show her, Fred.\\
548 - All right.\\
549 - A green light bulb?\\
550 - Yeah.\\
551 - Then you mean I'm not really sick at
all?\\
552 - No, honey, you're perfectly well.\\
553 - You were just pretending all the
time, you big bum.\\
554 - Now, wait a minute.\\
555 - Remember, you pretended first, you
know.\\
556 - This makes us igual Pascual.\\
557 - What does that mean?\\
558 - That's "even Steven" in Spanish.\\
559 - Come here.\\
560 - I guess you're right, honey.\\
561 - Mmm...\\
562 - Well, when do we start rehearsing?\\
563 - Rehearsing?\\
564 - You said I could be the star of the
show.\\
565 - Now, wait a minute, honey. I only
said...\\
566 - Ricky, you promised me.\\
567 - You said I could be the star of the
show.\\
568 - I didn't force you to say it, you
know.\\
569 - Now, Ricky, you made me a promise
and...\\
570 - What's the matter?\\
571 - Ricky?\\
572 - Ricky, what's the matter?\\
573 - Ricky!\\
574 - Who am I?\\
575 - What am I?\\
576 - Where am I?\\
577 - Oh, I give up, I give up.\\
578 - You win.\\
579 - The part of Hal March was
played by Hal March.

6 - "the genius of the conga drum\\
7 - "who, as usual, stopped the show last
night\\
8 - "with his rendition of 'Babaloo'\\
9 - Ricky Ricardo."\\
10 - Couldn't have been better if I wrote
it myself.\\
11 - How about that?\\
12 - Lucy... what are you doing?\\
13 - I'm writing a play.\\
14 - You're writing a what?\\
15 - A play.\\
16 - And there it is... finished.\\
17 - 125 pages dripping with drama\\
18 - dripping with intrigue, dripping with
excitement!\\
19 - I better get the mop.\\
20 - Never mind.\\
21 - I wonder if Ethel's ready with her
costume.\\
22 - Good.\\
23 - Oh, I wonder what she looks like.\\
24 - Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Shakespeare\\
25 - but, um... would you mind telling me\\
26 - what this is all about?\\
27 - Well, you see, all the women's clubs
in town\\
28 - are having a big playwriting contest.\\
29 - I knew it, I knew it.\\
30 - This had to do\\
31 - with the Wednesday Afternoon Fang and
Claw Society.\\
32 - It's the Wednesday Afternoon Fine
Arts League.\\
33 - Gee, just think, if our play wins\\
34 - I might become a big, famous
playwright.\\
35 - I might become another Tennessee
Ernie.\\
36 - That's Tennessee Williams.\\
37 - Oh.\\
38 - You know, that's a very interesting
name-- Tennessee.\\
39 - I wonder what I should call myself?\\
40 - How about "South Dakota Ricardo"?\\
41 - No, it's not so good, is it?\\
42 - Why don't you tell them you were born
in Providence?\\
43 - Then they can call you "Rhode Island
Red."\\
44 - Stop.\\
45 - Incidentally, how do you happen to be
the one\\
46 - who's writing this play?\\
47 - How do you think?\\
48 - You're the only one that has a
typewriter?\\
49 - No, smarty.\\
50 - I happen to be very close\\
51 - to the star who's going to play the
lead.\\
52 - Oh? Anyone I know?\\
53 - Well, I-I can't reveal his name.\\
54 - I'm saving it for publicity.\\
55 - Uh-huh.\\
56 - Uh, this, uh...
this, uh, star\\
57 - that is going to play the lead...\\
58 - his initials aren't "Ricky Ricardo,"
are they?\\
59 - Oh, don't be ridiculous.\\
60 - Hah! You flatter yourself.\\
61 - Da, da, da...\\
62 - Da, da, da, Da-da, da, da, da.\\
63 - Could I help you, madam?\\
64 - That's Ethel.\\
65 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
66 - How do you like my costume?\\
67 - It's just wonderful, Ethel.\\
68 - Who are you supposed to be?\\
69 - Well, what do you think?\\
70 - The Bride of Frankenstein?\\
71 - Well!\\
72 - She's a Spanish senora.\\
73 - She suffers in the translation.\\
74 - Oh...\\
75 - Are you ready for rehearsal?\\
76 - Rehearsal?\\
77 - You mean you finished the whole play
since dinner?\\
78 - Uh-huh.
It's only been two hours.\\
79 - Well, that's nothing for a famous
playwright\\
80 - like "Rhode Island Red."\\
81 - Huh?\\
82 - Oh, he means me.\\
83 - Pay no attention to him.\\
84 - What did it turn out to be\\
85 - a comedy, a drama or an epic?\\
86 - She wasn't sure when she started.\\
87 - Oh.\\
88 - A drama.\\
89 - Light or heavy?\\
90 - Well, about medium, I think.\\
91 - Well, that does it.\\
92 - Let me know when rehearsal is over.\\
93 - I thought maybe that you'd help us
out\\
94 - by reading the man's part.\\
95 - Well, honey, if I'm not going to be
in it\\
96 - what good would that do?\\
97 - Well, uh...\\
98 - Oh, please, Ricky, won't you do it
for me...\\
99 - and "Rhode Island Red"?\\
100 - Well, all right.\\
101 - If you put it that way, I will.\\
102 - Good.\\
103 - What is it all about?\\
104 - Well, it's a tender, moving,
heart-rending story\\
105 - of a Cuban tobacco picker\\
106 - and his love for the plantation
owner's daughter.\\
107 - Wait a minute.\\
108 - This play is all about a Cuban
tobacco picker?\\
109 - Yes, but don't worry--\\
110 - you're not going to be in it.\\
111 - Now, you go out in the kitchen\\
112 - and wait for your entrance cue.\\
113 - Now, go on.
Go on.\\
114 - All right.\\
115 - Now, remember, Ethel\\
116 - I am a gorgeous, dark-eyed beauty\\
117 - and you're my fat, ugly, old crone of
a mother.\\
118 - Fat?\\
119 - Yes.\\
120 - Well, it'll take a lot of acting\\
121 - but I guess I can do it.\\
122 - All right.\\
123 - Now, as the scene opens\\
124 - you're sitting outside your hacienda\\
125 - and you're rocking back and forth on
your veranda.\\
126 - Now, you're seated there.\\
127 - You're rocking back and forth\\
128 - and you're singing, and I come out of
my hacienda.\\
129 - La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la...\\
130 - How long do I keep singing?\\
131 - Till I make my entrance.\\
132 - La, la, la, la-la, la, la\\
133 - La-la, la, la, la-la, la, la, la...\\
134 - ?Como esta, Mamasita?\\
135 - "My bean, Lukita."\\
136 - "My bean, Lukita."\\
137 - That's "Muy bien, Lucita."\\
138 - Oh.\\
139 - Yeah.
"Muy bien, Lucita."\\
140 - Mamasita, how you like me in my new
dress?\\
141 - "You look very pretty, Lucita.\\
142 - "Your hair is shining, your eyes are
bright\\
143 - and your nose is continued on the
next page."\\
144 - You don't read that-- that's the
directions.\\
145 - Well, how can I tell?\\
146 - It's all run together.\\
147 - Well, I typed it in a big hurry,\\
148 - Now, go on...
and read it with an accent.\\
149 - This is in Spanish.\\
150 - Oh.\\
151 - "Why are you all dressed up, Lucita?"\\
152 - Because I think I go for a walk
through the mango trees.\\
153 - "That's nice?"\\
154 - "That's nice? That's nice?"\\
155 - What's the matter?
That's not a question!\\
156 - Well, there's a question mark here.\\
157 - There is not.\\
158 - Look.\\
159 - Oh. Well, there shouldn't be.\\
160 - You ought to know that.\\
161 - How should I ought to know that?\\
162 - Well, go on, go on.\\
163 - "That's nice.\\
164 - Do you go alone?"\\
165 - Si, I go alone.\\
166 - "Eh, eh, eh!\\
167 - I think you go there to meet your
liver."\\
168 - Lover!\\
169 - "I think you go there to meet your
lover\\
170 - "that worthless, good-for-nothing
tobacco picker.\\
171 - "How can you even look at him--\\
172 - you, the plantation owner's
daughter?"\\
173 - Shush, Mamasita, here he comes now.\\
174 - Shush, Mamasita, here he
comes now.\\
175 - Ricky, that's your cue!\\
176 - Oh.\\
177 - Senora y senorita.\\
178 - Buenas noches.\\
179 - ?Como estan?\\
180 - What are you doing with a sandwich?\\
181 - I didn't write that into the script.\\
182 - Well, I got so hungry waiting for my
cue, I ad-libbed it.\\
183 - Well, swallow and come on.\\
184 - All right.\\
185 - Uh... "Buenas noches, senora y
senorita.\\
186 - ?Como estan?"\\
187 - ?Como esta, mi amor?\\
188 - "?Como esta, you big bum?"\\
189 - Oh, you pay no attention to Mama,
Fernando.\\
190 - She no feel well.\\
191 - Now you kneel.\\
192 - I kneel. All right.\\
193 - Uh...\\
194 - "I am sorry to hear you don't feel
well, Mamasita.\\
195 - Are you having trouble with your
lover?"\\
196 - Liver!\\
197 - "Are you having trouble with your
liver?"\\
198 - "No, I am not, Fernando.\\
199 - "I am feeling not well\\
200 - "because you are in love with my
daughter\\
201 - "but you have no way\\
202 - to make money to support her, do
you?"\\
203 - "No, I dun't."\\
204 - No, Mama, he "dun't."\\
205 - Now, wait a minute, Wait a minute.\\
206 - Wh-What's the idea of making fun of
me in this play?\\
207 - Fun of you?\\
208 - Yeah, look at the way you got "don't"
D-U-N-T.\\
209 - Well, that's a typographical error.\\
210 - Yeah?\\
211 - Yeah, now go on.\\
212 - All right.\\
213 - "Someday I will be\\
214 - "a big man, senora.\\
215 - I am learning how to play the conga
drum."\\
216 - Oh, yes, Mama, he make nice music on
the drum.\\
217 - Lots of noise, Mama, yes.\\
218 - Mm-hmm.\\
219 - "Someday I will become famous\\
220 - "by singing a song called...\\
221 - 'Babaloo'"?\\
222 - Uh, it's a very nice song,
Mama.\\
223 - iBabaloo! iBabaloo!\\
224 - Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.\\
225 - Who is this Cuban tobacco picker\\
226 - who plays the conga drums and sings
"Babaloo"?\\
227 - Guess.\\
228 - Sir Cedric Hardwicke?\\
229 - No.\\
230 - John Charles Thomas?\\
231 - No.\\
232 - Lassie?\\
233 - All right, Ricky.\\
234 - I wrote the whole thing with you in
mind.\\
235 - No!\\
236 - Well, I thought when you read it\\
237 - and you found out what a good part it
was\\
238 - you'd want to be in it.\\
239 - Well, Lucy, I realize that this part\\
240 - will make Laurence Olivier hop on the
next boat\\
241 - but, uh... thanks just the same.\\
242 - But Ricky, you've got to do it.\\
243 - Why?\\
244 - Well, because...\\
245 - Because that's the only reason\\
246 - they let Lucy write the play.\\
247 - Lucy!\\
248 - You mean, you were just using me\\
249 - to further your own selfish purposes?\\
250 - For shame!\\
251 - But Ricky...\\
252 - I am sorry, I am not interested.\\
253 - Get yourself a new boy.\\
254 - Good-bye.\\
255 - Ricky Ricardo, you'll regret this!\\
256 - Well, I'm pretty sure that I will\\
257 - but, uh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Playwright.\\
258 - Thanks for thinking of me.\\
259 - I will always treasure\\
260 - this original carbon copy of your
masterpiece... forever.\\
261 - Oh...\\
262 - Oh, Lucy, I'm sorry I had to open my
big, fat mouth.\\
263 - Well, don't you worry, Ethel.\\
264 - There's a lot of actors in this town\\
265 - that'll jump at the chance\\
266 - and I'm going to call them right now.\\
267 - Uh-huh?\\
268 - Yes.\\
269 - Well, yes, yes, it's an original play
for a woman's club.\\
270 - Oh, yes, you'll be the star.\\
271 - How's that?\\
272 - Oh, no, we can't pay you anything.\\
273 - Well, you see, our club...\\
274 - Hello?\\
275 - Hello?\\
276 - Hello...\\
277 - Oh.\\
278 - Good morning, Lucy.
How you doing?\\
279 - Oh, awful.\\
280 - Actors are certainly peculiar.\\
281 - They won't work unless you pay them.\\
282 - Well, look, Lucy...\\
283 - Hmm?
as long as you haven't found anyone
to play the part\\
284 - I know someone who'll do it.\\
285 - Really?
Is he the right type?\\
286 - Oh, sure.\\
287 - He's a real Latin lover.\\
288 - I'll bring him in.\\
289 - Oh!\\
290 - Introducing Fernando.\\
291 - Tah-dah!\\
292 - Ya, dya-da, dya, dya, dya-da, dya-da,
da.\\
293 - Oh, Ethel, why do you always foist
Fred on me?\\
294 - Foist?\\
295 - Yes, foist.\\
296 - You're some Latin lover.\\
297 - Well, I took Latin in high school.\\
298 - Amo, amas, amat, amamus, amatis,
amant.\\
299 - What's the matter with that?\\
300 - But this is Spanish.\\
301 - Do you know how to speak Spanish?\\
302 - Bonus nokas, sinura.\\
303 - There, he sounds just like Ricky.\\
304 - Yeah, he sounds like Ricky speaking
English.\\
305 - Well, maybe he doesn't look the part\\
306 - and maybe he can't speak Spanish\\
307 - but you'll have to admit\\
308 - there's one thing in his favor.\\
309 - What?\\
310 - He's willing to do it.\\
311 - Oh, what a spot to be in.\\
312 - You know who's going to judge these
plays?\\
313 - A big movie producer, Darryl B.
Mayer.\\
314 - What a chance to be seen.\\
315 - Yeah, and I'm stuck\\
316 - with Fat Freddy, the Latin lover.\\
317 - Oh, now, wait a minute, Lucy.\\
318 - Give us a break.\\
319 - Why, I'll go on a diet.\\
320 - Well, that isn't the only thing,
Fred.\\
321 - The important thing is the way you
sound.\\
322 - Can you speak any other language?\\
323 - Say, he can do British.\\
324 - He can?\\
325 - Well, rather, old
thing.\\
326 - I'll put you through to my secretary.\\
327 - Cheerio! Pip-pip!\\
328 - And all that silly sort of rot.\\
329 - Hey, that isn't bad.\\
330 - How about you, Ethel?\\
331 - Oh, definitely, darling.\\
332 - Right-o, old bean.\\
333 - Good show, Deborah.\\
334 - Thank you.\\
335 - Ha-ha!
That's wonderful.\\
336 - How about you, Lucy?\\
337 - Uh, let's see now.\\
338 - Uh... afternoon, Mater.\\
339 - Pater won't be down for tea.\\
340 - We just buried him.\\
341 - Had to-- dead, you know.\\
342 - Oh, this is great!\\
343 - I'll switch the whole thing to
England.\\
344 - Right-o?\\
345 - Right-o!\\
346 - Right-o! Pip-pip, cheerio, here we
go.\\
347 - Well, there you are.\\
348 - Good morning, ladies.\\
349 - Would you pour me a spot of tea, my
dear louse?\\
350 - Louse?\\
351 - Oh... "My dear Louise."\\
352 - Hiya, Fred.\\
353 - Hi.\\
354 - I just came down to see if you want
to go to the fights.\\
355 - You know, Lucy is going to be in that
stupid play.\\
356 - I can't make it, Rick.\\
357 - Why not?\\
358 - Well, I'm going to be in the stupid
play, too.\\
359 - You are going to...?\\
360 - You mean to tell me\\
361 - you let them make a boob out of you?\\
362 - All right, go ahead and laugh.\\
363 - Just wait till Darryl B. Mayer gets a
gander at my performance.\\
364 - Darryl B. Mayer?\\
365 - Yeah.\\
366 - What does he want with a corny
contest like that?\\
367 - He's just going to judge the whole
thing, that's all.\\
368 - Hollywood, here I come.\\
369 - Darryl B. Mayer!\\
370 - Where you get an idea like that?\\
371 - It's in the morning paper.
Here.\\
372 - It is?\\
373 - Take a look at it yourself.\\
374 - Uh... Fred...\\
375 - old chum...\\
376 - old pal...\\
377 - old buddy...\\
378 - Yeah?\\
379 - We've been friends for a long time.\\
380 - Yeah.\\
381 - Well, I'm not going to let them do
this to you.\\
382 - You're not?\\
383 - No, sir.\\
384 - Old chum...\\
385 - old pal...\\
386 - Old buddy.\\
387 - I'm not going to let them make a boob
out of you.\\
388 - You're not?\\
389 - No, sir. I'm going to let them make a
boob out of me.\\
390 - And incidentally, let Mayer make a
star out of you.\\
391 - Fred, you hurt me when you say things
like that.\\
392 - You don't realize what a tremendous
sacrifice I'm making.\\
393 - and Lucy's would be worse than any of
them.\\
394 - Now, if Mayer sees you in a flop...\\
395 - you're finished.\\
396 - You know, I hadn't thought of that.\\
397 - I guess you're right.\\
398 - Of course I'm right.\\
399 - When is the play, tonight?
Yeah.\\
400 - Well, I better go upstairs and
rehearse my part, eh?\\
401 - Well, here, take this.\\
402 - No, no, I-I have my own script\\
403 - but listen, don't say anything to
Lucy, eh?\\
404 - I want to surprise her, see?\\
405 - I don't, uh... I don't want her to
think\\
406 - that I'm trying to get into her play.\\
407 - Oh, then you are trying to get into
it.\\
408 - Now, wait a minute.\\
409 - All right, Rick...\\
410 - old pal...\\
411 - old chum...\\
412 - old buddy...\\
413 - I'm not going to let you do it.\\
414 - Why not?\\
415 - Because the play is going to be a
flop--\\
416 - you said so yourself--\\
417 - and you can't afford to be in a flop.\\
418 - Well, Fred, you seem to forget\\
419 - one little thing that makes it
different.\\
420 - Oh, what's that?\\
421 - With me in it, how can it possibly be
a flop?\\
422 - Yeah, I did forget that.\\
423 - Adios.\\
424 - Adios.\\
425 - You have just seen Mrs. Glazingham's
play\\
426 - entitled Pearl One, Drop Two\\
427 - or Much Ado about Knitting.\\
428 - Isn't that a dear title?\\
429 - Knitting... I-I think...\\
430 - Oh, well, anyway, um...\\
431 - That brings us\\
432 - to the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts
entry in our contest.\\
433 - It was written by Mrs. Ricky Ricardo\\
434 - and is entitled The Perils of Pamela.\\
435 - Take it away, Wednesday Afternoon
Fine Arts League.\\
436 - A pip-pip and toodle-oo.\\
437 - I wonder what could be keeping my
daughter Pamela.\\
438 - She should have been here a fortnight
ago.\\
439 - Ah, there's dear old Pam now.\\
440 - Oh... oh, I must have been jolly well
mistaken.\\
441 - There's obviously no one there.\\
442 - Ah, here she comes now.\\
443 - She's coming up the walk.\\
444 - She must have had terrible trouble\\
445 - tethering her 'orse.\\
446 - Psst!\\
447 - Oh, daughter!\\
448 - How you startled me!\\
449 - Afternoon, Mater.\\
450 - Afternoon, daughter.\\
451 - Well, I don't mind telling you,
Mater, I've 'ad it.\\
452 - Why, whatever do you mean, Pamela?\\
453 - All morning long I was riding the
hounds\\
454 - and frankly, I'm pooped.\\
455 - Tired from riding the 'ounds?\\
456 - Yes, and I do believe\\
457 - Pamela, what you need is a spot of
tea.\\
458 - Right-o, Mater.\\
459 - That's it, a spot of tea.\\
460 - Thank you very much.\\
461 - There you are.\\
462 - Thank you.\\
463 - May I have some sugar?\\
464 - Thank you.\\
465 - May I have some milk?\\
466 - Thank you.\\
467 - May I have a needle and thread?\\
468 - Whatever for?\\
469 - I have a nasty tear in my tea bag.\\
470 - Pamela...\\
471 - I've been wanting to talk to you.\\
472 - What's the mater, Matter?\\
473 - Uh, what's the matter, Mater?\\
474 - It's about this Reggie you've been
going with.\\
475 - Oh!\\
476 - Not another word, Mater.\\
477 - I love the lad.\\
478 - That's all that matters, Mater.\\
479 - Well, we'll take this up with Pater
later.\\
480 - Mater!\\
481 - Now, Pamela.\\
482 - Oh, here comes Reggie now.\\
483 - Buenas noches\\
484 - senora y senorita.\\
485 - ?Como estan?\\
486 - Ricky!\\
487 - Uh, uh...\\
488 - Reggie!\\
489 - What happened?\\
490 - Uh...\\
491 - Oh, I know, Mater.\\
492 - You do?\\
493 - Yes, Reggie's all dressed up\\
494 - for the king's birthday ball.\\
495 - Oh, good show!\\
496 - Yes, good show.\\
497 - I think it stinks.\\
498 - Uh... uh, Reggie, what you need is\\
499 - a spot of tea and a crumpet.\\
500 - Si, Mamasita.\\
501 - Si, Mamasita.\\
502 - I'm sorry you're not feeling well.\\
503 - Are you having trouble with your
liver?\\
504 - Um...\\
505 - What now?\\
506 - There will be a short intermission.\\
507 - I don't know.
What's happen...?\\
508 - Ricky, what's the matter with you?\\
509 - I never was so humiliated in my life.\\
510 - What are you trying to do, ruin my
whole play?\\
511 - Yeah, what are you trying to do?\\
512 - No, no, honest, I was trying to be
good.\\
513 - I just wanted to surprise you.
What happened?\\
514 - "What happened?" You're doing the
wrong script.\\
515 - We switched to British.\\
516 - This is the one we're doing.\\
517 - Oh, well, what are we going to do?\\
518 - Well, we'll just have to change\\
519 - so that we're all doing the same
thing.\\
520 - Oh, all right, all right.\\
521 - Oh, Lucy...\\
522 - What's happened?\\
523 - What shall I tell the audience?\\
524 - Well, tell them that we're going to
change costumes\\
525 - and we're going back to the original
version, A Tree Grows in Havana.\\
526 - Oh, I hope I don't get my "cheerios"
mixed up\\
527 - with my "como estas."\\
528 - You won't.
Come on.\\
529 - Oh, what shall we do?\\
530 - Well, entertain them, Miss Mitchell.\\
531 - Entertain them.\\
532 - Me?!\\
533 - Sure, go ahead.\\
534 - Oh, all right.\\
535 - I just happened to bring a poem.\\
536 - "By the shores of Gitche Gumee\\
537 - "By the shining big-sea-water\\
538 - "Stood the wigwam of Nokomis\\
539 - "Daughter of the moon, Nokomis.\\

2 - Just like the girl\\
3 - That married dear, old Dad\\
4 - My dear old dad.\\
5 - Oh, that was wonderful!\\
6 - We're great.\\
7 - Yeah, you even sounded good.\\
8 - Thank you.\\
9 - You know, a little more practice and
we could do\\
10 - singing commercials for television.\\
11 - Gee, Ethel, you certainly play the
piano wonderfully.\\
12 - Oh, thanks, Lucy.\\
13 - Hey, how about "Sweet Sue"?\\
14 - Yeah, that has a nice harmony, all
right?\\
15 - Da-da da-da-da-da...\\
16 - Oh, wait a minute, Ethel.\\
17 - It's, uh, it's 2:00 in the morning.\\
18 - Well, what about it, honey?\\
19 - Yeah, yeah, 2:00's the perfect time
for "Sweet Sue."\\
20 - Yeah.
Well, I mean, it's a little late.\\
21 - Won't the other tenants complain?\\
22 - About what, honey?
About what?\\
23 - About all the noise.\\
24 - Noise?
Noise?
Noise?\\
25 - Huh, we're not making noise; we're
making music.\\
26 - Yeah. Let them phone the landlord.\\
27 - I'm not home.\\
28 - I always forget that you're the
landlord.\\
29 - Yeah, come on.\\
30 - Besides, what's wrong with good
friends harmonizing a little?\\
31 - That's what the world needs more of.\\
32 - You're right.\\
33 - Oh, it's so wonderful to have
landlords like you two.\\
34 - What a break for us to have tenants
like you two.\\
35 - Well, okay, okay, "Sweet Sue." Yeah.\\
36 - Da-da da-da-da-da...\\
37 - Look at this place, Lucy.\\
38 - You've taken such good care of it\\
39 - we could rent it tomorrow and not
have to change a thing.\\
40 - Yeah.
Okay, okay, "Sweet Sue."\\
41 - Da-da da-da-da-da...\\
42 - Well, you know why, Ethel?\\
43 - It was in such wonderful condition
when we moved in.\\
44 - Well, all right, all right, girls.\\
45 - Now, "Sweet Sue."\\
46 - Da-da da-da da-da...\\
47 - You're the nicest tenant I ever had.\\
48 - And you're certainly\\
49 - the nicest landlady I've ever had.\\
50 - And this is the most sickening
conversation\\
51 - I've ever heard.\\
52 - You're so right.\\
53 - Oh...
Oh, you two have no sentiment.\\
54 - I move that we dedicate the next
number\\
55 - to our wonderful friendship.\\
56 - All right, to our friendship.
I subscribe to that.\\
57 - That's a wonderful idea.
To Ricky and Lucy.\\
58 - Here we go.\\
59 - Ah, now then.
All right?\\
60 - "Sweet Sue"-- ready, go.\\
61 - "Sweet Sue." Good, wasn't it?\\
62 - Da-da da-da-da-da\\
63 - Every star above\\
64 - Knows the one I love\\
65 - Sweet Sue, just you\\
66 - And the moon up high\\
67 - Knows the reason why\\
68 - Sweet Sue, yes, you\\
69 - No one else, it seems, ever shared my
dreams\\
70 - And without you, dear, I don't know
what I'd do\\
71 - In this heart of mine you live all
the time\\
72 - Sweet Sue, that's you\\
73 - Nobody but you.\\
74 - Oh, that's all.
It's getting late.
We got to go.\\
75 - Yeah, we got to get out of here.\\
76 - You got to go?
Oh, no, Ethel.\\
77 - Thanks for everything, now.
Oh, honey, no.\\
78 - Oh, that's too bad.
Thanks for everything, Rick.\\
79 - Well, I'm glad you came up, Fred.
We've enjoyed it.\\
80 - See you in the morning.\\
81 - Good-bye, Ethel.
You cut that out.\\
82 - Good night.
Good night.\\
83 - Good night.\\
84 - Oh...\\
85 - Gee...\\
86 - Aren't they wonderful people?\\
87 - Yeah, they sure are a lot of fun,
honey.\\
88 - Oh, I had such a good time tonight.\\
89 - I want to live in this apartment the
rest of my life.\\
90 - Well, honey, I think that you and I
and Fred and Ethel\\
91 - are fated to go through life
together.\\
92 - Yep.
Hey, look.\\
93 - Ethel left her rings here.\\
94 - Oh, yeah.
Yeah.\\
95 - You know, honey, she's absolutely
right.\\
96 - People ought to do more singing in
this world.\\
97 - That's right, honey.\\
98 - Yes, sir, they sure should sing--
everybody.\\
99 - "Sweet Sue."\\
100 - Every star above knows the one I love\\
101 - Sweet Sue, just you\\
102 - And the moon up high knows the reason
why\\
103 - Sweet Sue, yes, you\\
104 - No one else, it seems, ever shared my
dreams\\
105 - And without you, dear, I don't know
what I'd do.\\
106 - Ya-da-bum, ba-de-dum, ba-de-dum,
bum-bum.\\
107 - What was that?\\
108 - I don't know.\\
109 - Come on, let's go.\\
110 - In this heart of mine, you l...\\
111 - That sounded like it came from the
Mertz apartment.\\
112 - Oh, no, honey, it couldn't be.\\
113 - No, I guess not.\\
114 - You live all the...\\
115 - Time.\\
116 - Sweet Sue, it's you.\\
117 - Hello?\\
118 - Hello, Lucy?\\
119 - Hi, Ethel, what's you...
what's on your mind?\\
120 - What's going on up there, anyway?\\
121 - Oh, we're singing "Sweet Sue."\\
122 - Want to come up for another chorus?\\
123 - Do you know what time it is?\\
124 - How do you expect anybody to get to
sleep?\\
125 - Why, Ethel, what's the matter?\\
126 - You thought it was fine when you were
up here.\\
127 - Well, I'm down here now and I think
it's lousy.\\
128 - Well, really, Ethel!\\
129 - How can you change in such a short
time?\\
130 - Good night, Lucy.\\
131 - Good night.\\
132 - What's the matter with Ethel?\\
133 - She must've walked downstairs too
fast and gotten the bends.\\
134 - What?\\
135 - Well, she's a little grumpy because
we're making noise.\\
136 - Well, I thought she...
Well, so did I.\\
137 - She'll be over it in the morning.\\
138 - All right.
Come on, honey, let's go to bed.\\
139 - Da-da da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da...\\
140 - 94, 95, 96...\\
141 - 97, 98, 99, 100.\\
142 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
143 - Now, Ricky...\\
144 - All right, all right, we'll
compromise.\\
145 - That's a compromise?\\
146 - Now, what do you want me to do,
freeze to death?\\
147 - A little fresh air isn't going to
hurt you\\
148 - you hothouse plant.\\
149 - Hello?\\
150 - Will you cut out that racket up
there?\\
151 - Fred?\\
152 - Yes, Fred!\\
153 - How do you expect people to get any
sleep?\\
154 - Well, I was only closing the windows.\\
155 - What with? A sledgehammer?\\
156 - Now listen, Fred...\\
157 - Listen, my foot.\\
158 - Now, let's have it quiet up there!\\
159 - Huh, how do you like that?\\
160 - "Let's have it quiet up there!" he
says.\\
161 - Some lousy landlords they are.\\
162 - Yeah.\\
163 - Nerts to the Mertz.\\
164 - Yeah.\\
165 - Well...
good night, baby.\\
166 - Good night, honey.\\
167 - Oh, no.\\
168 - The shower is dripping.\\
169 - Yep, sure is.\\
170 - Somebody should get up and fix it.\\
171 - Yep, somebody should.\\
172 - Well?\\
173 - Well?\\
174 - This isn't getting us anyplace.\\
175 - We'll both get up and fix it.\\
176 - What?\\
177 - That's the only fair way.\\
178 - When I count to three, we'll both
jump out of bed.\\
179 - All right.\\
180 - You ready?
Ready.\\
181 - Okay.\\
182 - One...\\
183 - two...\\
184 - three!\\
185 - Apparently, we can't trust either of
us.\\
186 - Apparently.\\
187 - Well, as far as I'm concerned, that
shower can drip all night.\\
188 - I just don't care.\\
189 - I won't pay any attention to it.\\
190 - All right, neither will I.\\
191 - All right.
All right.\\
192 - I can't stand it anymore!\\
193 - I can't stand it, I tell you!\\
194 - I can't stand it!\\
195 - I can't stand it anymore!\\
196 - I can't stand it!\\
197 - What are you doing?\\
198 - I can't lock it up!
I can't lock it!\\
199 - I'm going to use the wrench.\\
200 - Oh...\\
201 - Hello?\\
202 - What's going on up there now?!\\
203 - Ricky's trying to fix some of your
antique plumbing!\\
204 - That's what's going on!\\
205 - Oh, no.\\
206 - Let me talk to him!\\
207 - All right!\\
208 - Fred wants to talk to you!\\
209 - Just a minute!\\
210 - Just a minute!\\
211 - Oh, Ricky!\\
212 - Ricky, what happened?!\\
213 - What happened?!
What happened?!\\
214 - Oh...\\
215 - Oh...\\
216 - The pipe broke, that's what happened!\\
217 - Oh, honey, you're all wet.\\
218 - Give me that phone! Hello!\\
219 - Listen, lunkhead, stop pounding on
those pipes!\\
220 - Listen, you old poop\\
221 - why don't you put some decent
plumbing in this firetrap?!\\
222 - We will, as soon as we get some
decent tenants!\\
223 - Yeah? Well, maybe you'd like us to
move.\\
224 - That'd suit me fine.\\
225 - All right, all right!\\
226 - That settles it-- we're moving!\\
227 - Good-bye and good riddance!\\
228 - Good-bye!\\
229 - We're moving!\\
230 - Good!\\
231 - They're moving.\\
232 - Good!\\
233 - I wouldn't stay in this crummy
apartment\\
234 - with those horrible Mertzes if you
paid me.\\
235 - Hello!\\
236 - Hello. I'd like to speak to Mrs.
Mertz.\\
237 - Hello.\\
238 - Whoever told you you could play the
piano?!\\
239 - Good morning.\\
240 - I hate to bother you, Mrs. Ricardo\\
241 - but I believe I left my diamond rings\\
242 - on your piano last night.\\
243 - Yes, you did, Mrs. Mertz.\\
244 - I'd be very happy to get them for
you.\\
245 - Oh, don't bother.\\
246 - I'll get them...\\
247 - if they're still there.\\
248 - I don't know why you should worry.\\
249 - You can always buy another box of
Cracker Jack.\\
250 - I'll have you know these are real
diamonds.\\
251 - Ha!\\
252 - Mrs. Ricardo, would you be so kind as
to inform me\\
253 - just when we are to be deprived of
your charming company?\\
254 - Very shortly.\\
255 - Good.\\
256 - Thank you.\\
257 - My, it'll certainly be nice\\
258 - getting away from such disagreeable
people.\\
259 - It certainly will.\\
260 - Would you like to give me the check\\
261 - for the next five months' rent now?\\
262 - Of course, I'd be delighted.\\
263 - What do you mean "the next five
months' rent"?\\
264 - Well, if you're leaving\\
265 - you have to pay off your lease.\\
266 - Our lease?!\\
267 - Yes, don't you remember?\\
268 - You begged me on bended knee to give
you a lease\\
269 - just so that no one else could have\\
270 - this fantastically inexpensive,
lovely apartment.\\
271 - Oh, you mean that one-sided, unfair,
binding contract\\
272 - that we were forced to sign\\
273 - before you would grant us the
privilege\\
274 - of moving into this broken-down
hovel?\\
275 - "Broken-down" is right.\\
276 - Look at this place.\\
277 - It'll take the next five months' rent
to redecorate.\\
278 - Redecorate?\\
279 - Yes.\\
280 - After we fumigate.\\
281 - You can leave the check in my
mailbox.\\
282 - I...\\
283 - Ooh!\\
284 - Honey, I don't seem to be able to...\\
285 - Oh, shut up!\\
286 - What's the matter with you?\\
287 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
288 - Ethel was just up here and she made
me so darn mad!\\
289 - What now?\\
290 - She says she...
they're going to hold us to our
lease.\\
291 - We have to give them five months'
rent\\
292 - before we can leave!\\
293 - I guess we're stuck here.\\
294 - Well, now that, uh...
that all depends.\\
295 - On what?\\
296 - On whether we can, uh, break the
lease or not.\\
297 - Do you think we can?\\
298 - Mm... could be.\\
299 - What's on your mind?\\
300 - We are going to become the two most
unpleasant, disagreeable\\
301 - nasty people in the whole world.\\
302 - But how?\\
303 - We'll force ourselves.\\
304 - Oh, boy.\\
305 - Let's see, now.\\
306 - What can we think of that'll make
them kick us out?\\
307 - Nah...\\
308 - Think nastier.\\
309 - We'll get it.\\
310 - Hiya, honey.\\
311 - Hi!\\
312 - How's my little lease-breaker doing?\\
313 - Just fine.\\
314 - Ha, ha! That's good.\\
315 - How'd things go at rehearsal?\\
316 - Oh, pretty good, honey.\\
317 - Look.\\
318 - What's that?\\
319 - A riveter's hammer. Watch.\\
320 - Hey, that's very good.\\
321 - That's very good.\\
322 - I'm surprised they haven't moved out.\\
323 - Yeah?
I have quite a schedule.\\
324 - Oh, it's time to make another call to
Ethel.\\
325 - Let me, let me, let me do this.\\
326 - Hey!
What happened?\\
327 - Shh-- get this.
Yeah?\\
328 - Hello, this is the Ajax Salvage
Company.\\
329 - We buy old glass.\\
330 - I understand you have some rings\\
331 - that you're interested in selling.\\
332 - Oh, she's furious!\\
333 - Oh, am I glad I'm on your side!\\
334 - We'll break that lease yet.\\
335 - Now, remember, when you come home
tonight\\
336 - make a lot of noise.\\
337 - Oh, that reminds me.\\
338 - I won't be home till late tonight,
honey.\\
339 - Why?
Well, we have to rehearse\\
340 - for a couple of hours after the club
closes.\\
341 - Ricky, why don't you have the
rehearsal here?\\
342 - Honey, are you crazy?\\
343 - I got a 16-piece band.\\
344 - I'll blow the roof off the joint.\\
345 - Well... doesn't look like rain.\\
346 - I'll do it.\\
347 - I'll do it.\\
348 - Good.\\
349 - Yeah! Yeah!\\
350 - Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!\\
351 - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!\\

359 - Oh, that was wonderful!\\
360 - That's the best number you've done
since midnight.\\
361 - What time is it?\\
362 - Uh, 4:30.\\
363 - All right, now let's have a loud one.\\
364 - A loud one?
Yeah.\\
365 - All right.\\
366 - Listen, I wonder how Fred and Ethel
are enjoying it.\\
367 - Well, they have a lot of courage.\\
368 - I haven't heard a peep out of them.\\
369 - Oh, boy, this is swell.\\
370 - No, isn't it?\\
371 - Honey, who are all these people?\\
372 - I don't know, but the more, the
noisier.\\
373 - Yeah?\\
374 - All right, we'll dedicate the next
number\\
375 - to Fred and Ethel Mertz.\\
376 - Great!
All right.
Fred and Ethel Mertz?\\
377 - Yes, our lovely landlords.\\
378 - They won't hear this.\\
379 - They're still down in the street.\\
380 - Down in the street?\\
381 - Yes, they have a big sign\\
382 - Ricky Ricardo in Person"\\
383 - and they're selling tickets.\\
384 - Oh, no!\\
385 - Oh!\\
386 - How do you like that?\\
387 - I'm going down there\\
388 - and give them a piece of my mind.
Yeah!\\
389 - Oh, they're back in their apartment.\\
390 - It was too cold outside.\\
391 - Oh...
They sold us the last tickets.\\
392 - Oh, they're back in their apartment,
are they?\\
393 - Well, we'll dedicate the next number\\
394 - to Fred and Ethel Mertz--\\
395 - an old Cuban folk dance called "El
Break-o the Lease-o."\\
396 - "El Break-o the Lease-o"?
Yes.\\
397 - How does this old Cuban folk dance
go?\\
398 - Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum\\
399 - Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-dum...\\
400 - Oh, that one!
That one!\\
401 - Everybody!\\
402 - Okay...\\
403 - Okay, you win.\\
404 - Here's your lease.\\
405 - Ba da...
ba-da-dah...\\
406 - Is that all, honey?\\
407 - I think so.\\
408 - Gee, it'll certainly be good\\
409 - to get out of this joint, won't it?\\
410 - Yeah. Did you tell Ethel we were
moving today?\\
411 - Well, I haven't seen her since she
brought up the lease.\\
412 - I mailed her a note\\
413 - telling her to come up and get the
keys today.\\
414 - What shall I do about this?\\
415 - What is it?\\
416 - It's a picture of us and Fred and
Ethel\\
417 - taken in Atlantic City last summer.\\
418 - Oh.\\
419 - We sure had a lot of fun there,
didn't we?\\
420 - Yeah.\\
421 - What shall I do, throw it away?\\
422 - Oh, no, no, I better pack it.\\
423 - Huh?\\
424 - Well, we can always cut them out with
a scissors.\\
425 - What are all these things here?\\
426 - Oh, they're some things I borrowed
from Ethel.\\
427 - She has a lot of my things, too\\
428 - if she hasn't sold them.\\
429 - You know, I got a lot of tools that
belong to Fred.\\
430 - Some of them we bought together.\\
431 - What shall I do with those?\\
432 - I don't know.\\
433 - Gee, it's amazing we could have been
such good friends\\
434 - with a couple of stinkers.\\
435 - Yeah... we sure had a lot of fun in
the last nine years...\\
436 - until they showed their true colors.\\
437 - Yeah.\\
438 - Well, that just shows you how sneaky
they are.\\
439 - Yeah.\\
440 - Yeah.
Here, honey, you want some paper for
that?\\
441 - Come in, come in, please.\\
442 - All these are yours.\\
443 - Oh, thanks.\\
444 - Uh...\\
445 - These are yours, I guess.\\
446 - Thanks.
It's all right.\\
447 - Here's some things of yours\\
448 - that somehow got into my apartment.\\
449 - Thanks.\\
450 - There are some of your things\\
451 - that I managed to get hold of.\\
452 - It's all there.\\
453 - You can count it if you like.\\
454 - Oh, well, that won't be necessary,
Mrs. Mertz.\\
455 - I trust you.\\
456 - You do?\\
457 - Uh...\\
458 - Uh...\\
459 - Uh...\\
460 - look, uh, Fred, uh\\
461 - it doesn't matter to me, you know\\
462 - but, uh, for some crazy reason or
other\\
463 - I think Lucy wants to stay.\\
464 - Don't you, Lucy?\\
465 - Well, it doesn't matter to me either\\
466 - but it's, uh, up to Ethel.\\
467 - What do you say, honey?\\
468 - I...\\
469 - You heard what the girls said.\\
470 - I guess we're staying, eh?\\
471 - Yeah.\\
472 - Only-Only this time, I want a long
lease\\
473 - so that we don't ever get kicked out.\\
474 - Well...\\
475 - Fred...\\
476 - I just happen to have a new lease\\
477 - already made out.\\

18 - we're not going to go all over this
again.\\
19 - You cannot be in the show.\\
20 - Give me one good reason.\\
21 - You have no talent.\\
22 - Give me another good reason.\\
23 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
24 - Look, honey, even if I wanted to put
you in the show\\
25 - I wouldn't be able to do it.\\
26 - There's only two openings--\\
27 - a ballet dancer and a pair of
burlesque comics.\\
28 - I'm a ballet dancer.\\
29 - Well, I am, and I've had...
I've had experience, too.\\
30 - I-I-I was in a dance recital in high
school--\\
31 - "The Dance of the Flowers."\\
32 - She has got nice stems.\\
33 - LUCY: Thank you.\\
34 - I was the only petunia that did a
solo.\\
35 - Look, Petunia, Madame Lamand--\\
36 - the premier ballerina of the French
Ballet--\\
37 - is staging this number.\\
38 - I hardly think that she would
consider that training enough.\\
39 - Well, then she'll just have to be
shown.\\
40 - I just happen to have that costume in
my trunk\\
41 - and I know that I can do that dance\\
42 - just as well now as I did then.\\
43 - Once you really know ballet, it never
leaves you.\\
44 - Lucy, I didn't know you were a ballet
dancer.\\
45 - For four years, I was never off my
toes.\\
46 - What am I going to do about her?\\
47 - Have you ever thought of putting her
in a large basket\\
48 - and leaving her on somebody's
doorstep?\\
49 - (chuckling): No, that wouldn't work.\\
50 - She's too smart; she'd find her way
home.\\
51 - Hey, Rick...
(clears throat)\\
52 - You know those comedians you want--\\
53 - do they... do they really have to be,
uh, burlesque comics?\\
54 - You know, I did a very funny act
years ago\\
55 - with my partner, Ted Kertz.\\
56 - Mertz and Kertz, the laugh twins.\\
57 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
58 - Presenting Mertz and Kertz.\\
59 - Well, if I ain't my ol...
if it ain't my old friend, Fred.\\
60 - How are you, Fred?\\
61 - Well, if it ain't my old friend, Ted.\\
62 - How are you, Ted?\\
63 - Did you hear about the terrible
accident\\
64 - on the streetcar, Freddy?\\
65 - No, I didn't hear about an accident\\
66 - on the streetcar, Teddy.\\
67 - You mean to tell me you didn't hear\\
68 - about the accident on the streetcar,
Teddy?\\
69 - Mertz...\\
70 - I'm Kertz.\\
71 - Now I'm Mertz.\\
72 - How are you, Rick?\\
73 - They have to be burlesque comics.\\
74 - Aw, pshaw, that's too bad.\\
75 - Hey, by the way\\
76 - what was the terrible accident on the
streetcar?\\
77 - (laughing)\\
78 - Wouldn't you like to know?\\
79 - No.\\
80 - Well, I'll tell you anyway\\
81 - but remember, this is my best gag\\
82 - and you got to promise not to use it.\\
83 - Okay, I promise.\\
84 - What was the terrible accident on the
streetcar, Fred?\\
85 - Well, a man had his eye on a seat\\
86 - and a woman sat on it.\\
87 - (laughing)\\
88 - What a pip-a-roo!\\
89 - Remember now, you promised not to use
it.\\
90 - That's one promise I will never
break.\\
91 - Introducing Petunia Ricardo.\\
92 - (music)\\
93 - (piano playing "Dance of the
Sugarplum Fairies")\\
94 - (music ends)\\
95 - Well?\\
96 - Well, you'll do for the comic\\
97 - but who am I going to get for the
ballet dancer?\\
98 - Oh, Ricky, you're mean.\\
99 - Look, honey, you're not serious about
this, are you?\\
100 - I am, too.\\
101 - Here I am with all this talent\\
102 - bottled up inside of me\\
103 - and you're always sitting on the
cork.\\
104 - Now, Lucy.\\
105 - I'm gonna get in that show if it's
the last thing I do.\\
106 - Lucy, you're too young to die.\\
107 - Whose side are you on?\\
108 - ETHEL: Well...\\
109 - I'm going to get in that show or my
name isn't Lucy Ricardo.\\
110 - What did you say, Clem?\\
111 - Oh!\\
112 - (laughing): Touche.\\
113 - En garde!\\
114 - I have just had a most exciting visit\\
115 - with the wife of Monsieur Ricardo.\\
116 - She is a very experienced dancer\\
117 - and she will be your partner.\\
118 - She is here now.\\
119 - Come in, Madame Ricardo.\\
120 - Entrez, entrez, entrez.\\
121 - Come in, come in.\\
122 - Mesdames et messieurs, Madame
Ricardo.\\
123 - Kiss the hand, Enchante, N'est-ce
pas?\\
124 - Now, first I think we will start\\
125 - with a few limbering-up exercises.\\
126 - I assume you know all the basic
positions.\\
127 - Uh, yeah, yeah.\\
128 - All right, Ici, madame, ici.\\
129 - Classe, en place.\\
130 - All righty, class.\\
131 - Now then, first position.\\
132 - Bon, bon.\\
133 - No, madame, further out.\\
134 - No, madame, the toes...
further out.\\
135 - Madame, not that far out.\\
136 - Now then, a plie.\\
137 - And a one, a two, a three, a four\\
138 - a five, a six, a seven, eight.\\
139 - A one, a two, a three, a four, a
five...\\
140 - Stop, stop, stop.\\
141 - Stop!\\
142 - Fifth position.\\
143 - Now then...\\
144 - Plie.\\
145 - And a one, a two, a three, a four\\
146 - a five, a six, a seven, eight.\\
147 - A one...\\
148 - Tres bien, classe.\\
149 - Petite battement.\\
150 - And a one, a two, a three, a change.\\
151 - A one, a two, a three, a change.\\
152 - A one, a two, a three, a change.\\
153 - A one, a two, a three, a change.\\
154 - One, a two, a three, a change.\\
155 - One, a two, a three, a change.\\
156 - One, a two, a three, a change.\\
157 - a one, a two...\\
158 - (taps floor with cane)\\
159 - Un moment, un moment.\\
160 - Releve.\\
161 - Tour en l'air.\\
162 - A one, a two, a three, a four\\
163 - a five, a six, a seven, eight.\\
164 - A one, a two, a three, a four\\
165 - a five, a six, a seven, eight.\\
166 - A one, a two, a three, a four...\\
167 - Enough! Enough!\\
168 - Take a rest period!\\
169 - Except Madame Ricardo.\\
170 - Madame Ricardo, I am afraid\\
171 - you have not quite had\\
172 - the experience I had hoped for.\\
173 - Well, I guess I am a little rusty.\\
174 - I think we should go to the barre.\\
175 - Oh, good, because I'm awful thirsty.\\
176 - Madame...\\
177 - This barre.\\
178 - Oh, I thought you meant...\\
179 - Take your place at the barre.\\
180 - Feet in first position.\\
181 - Now, in the first place\\
182 - your posture is atrocious.\\
183 - Shoulders back, hips under\\
184 - stomach in, chest out\\
185 - chin up, knees straight.\\
186 - Now then, remembering all these
things\\
187 - raise the right leg even with the
barre.\\
188 - Even with the barre?\\
189 - Even with the barre.\\
190 - Now then, lower the leg\\
191 - slowly to the floor.\\
192 - Madame, the leg down, a bas.\\
193 - A bas!\\
194 - A bas.\\
195 - A bas.\\
196 - A bas! A bas!\\
197 - A bas!\\
198 - A bas.\\
199 - A bas, a bas.\\
200 - A bas.\\
201 - A-a-a bas!\\
202 - A bas.\\
203 - A bas.\\
204 - A bas.\\
205 - A bas.\\
206 - A bas.\\
207 - A bas.\\
208 - A bas.\\
209 - A bas!\\
210 - A bas.\\
211 - A bas.\\
212 - Where are you going?\\
213 - No, no, no, no, there is much work to
do.\\
214 - There is?\\
215 - Oui, you have great talent.\\
216 - I have?\\
217 - But there is much to do\\
218 - to get you in shape for the opening.\\
219 - Now then, at the barre\\
220 - feet in first position.\\
221 - Shoulders back, hips under\\
222 - stomach in, chest out\\
223 - chin up, knees straight.\\
224 - Now then, plie.\\
225 - 500 times!\\
226 - And a one, a two, a three, a four\\
227 - a five, a six, a seven, eight...\\
228 - (phone rings)\\
229 - Hello.\\
230 - Hello, Lucy.
How are you feeling today?\\
231 - Can you move yet?\\
232 - Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
As a matter of fact\\
233 - I'm expecting my partner here any
minute.\\
234 - Your partner?
I thought you gave up ballet.\\
235 - Oh, I did; that was too much work.\\
236 - No, I called the Lido Theater and
asked them\\
237 - to send over a comic to teach me a
burlesque act.\\
238 - (doorbell buzzes)
Oh, somebody's at the door; maybe
that's him.\\
239 - I'll call you back later, Ethel.\\
240 - Well, this must be the place.\\
241 - (whistles)\\
242 - Well, what time do the girls get
here?\\
243 - Uh, how do you do?
I'm Mrs. Ricardo.\\
244 - Oh, how do you do?
Where's the fella\\
245 - who wants me to teach him a bit?\\
246 - Oh, right here.\\
247 - Say, you're a nice-looking fella.\\
248 - Thank you. You see, I have a
wonderful chance\\
249 - to get into a show if I can do a
burlesque act.\\
250 - Oh, I don't know about doing this bit
with a dame.\\
251 - These bit-bits are done by two men.\\
252 - Well, couldn't you just pretend that
I'm a man?\\
253 - Okay, I got a good imagination.\\
254 - Come here.\\
255 - Here, this will help.\\
256 - Try it on.\\
257 - Okay.\\
258 - Now, let's see.\\
259 - What bit will we do?\\
260 - How about "Slowly I turn"?\\
261 - Slowly I turn?\\
262 - What's that?\\
263 - That's the name of the sketch.\\
264 - Oh.
Want to try it?\\
265 - All right.\\
266 - There isn't much to it.\\
267 - What do I do?\\
268 - Well, I'll be sitting here on this
park bench here.\\
269 - You come along, tell me I look down
in the mouth.\\
270 - Ask me if you can help.\\
271 - Yeah, well, what happens then?\\
272 - Well, the rest of it sort of takes
care of itself.\\
273 - Okay.
Want to try it?\\
274 - Yeah.\\
275 - Uh, you look down in the mouth.\\
276 - Can I help you?\\
277 - Stranger, you have a kind face.\\
278 - Would you like to hear my story?\\
279 - Say, "Yeah."\\
280 - Yeah.\\
281 - Okay.\\
282 - I wasn't always a bum.\\
283 - Once I was handsome like you.\\
284 - Then she came into my life.\\
285 - It was love at first sight.\\
286 - And we were married\\
287 - and very happy\\
288 - until one night, there came a knock
at the door.\\
289 - I opened it.\\
290 - A stranger was there.\\
291 - I vowed to make my home his home.\\
292 - And that was the beginning of the
end.\\
293 - One night when I returned home from
work\\
294 - I found the usual note.\\
295 - The stranger had stolen my wife away.\\
296 - Then the search began.\\
297 - I followed them all over the world\\
298 - Until one day I saw them at Niagara
Falls--\\
299 - that beast and my lovely wife.\\
300 - I never mention her name because when
I do\\
301 - everything turns black in front of
me.\\
302 - I'm possessed with a lust to kill.\\
303 - That's why I never mention her name.\\
304 - But it's the same as George
Washington's wife.\\
305 - Martha?\\
306 - Martha... that's it, Martha.\\
307 - Slowly I turned\\
308 - step by step, inch by inch\\
309 - I crept up on the beast\\
310 - who had ruined my life.\\
311 - I looked around for a rock.\\
312 - I grab one, I let him have it.\\
313 - Revenge was all I had on my mind.
(screaming)\\
314 - Stop it! Stop it!\\
315 - Stop it!\\
316 - What's the matter with you?\\
317 - Oh.\\
318 - Oh, you're not him.\\
319 - No!\\
320 - You're the one with the kind face.\\
321 - Yeah!\\
322 - I'm sorry.\\
323 - I'm not well.\\
324 - Well, that's all right, I understand.\\
325 - I guess it might have been quite a
shock to you thinking\\
326 - about Martha.\\
327 - Martha!\\
328 - Martha!\\
329 - Slowly I turned\\
330 - step by step\\
331 - inch by inch, I crept up on him.\\
332 - I looked around for another rock.\\
333 - I grab it.\\
334 - I let him have it once more.\\
335 - Revenge, that's all I wanted.\\
336 - Stop! Stop it!\\
337 - Give me that thing.\\
338 - What's the matter with you?
Don't you remember me?\\
339 - Oh, it's you.\\
340 - Yeah, the one with the kind face.\\
341 - I'm sorry.\\
342 - I'm very weak.\\
343 - I should have met you when I was
stronger.\\
344 - Yeah, you should have met me before
you met Ma... Oh.\\
345 - I almost said "Martha."\\
346 - Slowly I turned\\
347 - step by step, inch by inch.\\
348 - I looked around for a rock.\\
349 - I couldn't find one.\\
350 - So, I grabbed a handful of Niagara
Falls\\
351 - and I let him have it.\\
352 - Give me that thing.\\
353 - That's enough of this.\\
354 - I agree with you.\\
355 - It's too much.\\
356 - I'm ashamed of myself.\\
357 - Well, you ought to be.\\
358 - Look at me, I'm a mess.\\
359 - That's a very strange way to react\\
360 - just because you hear the name
Martha.\\
361 - Martha! Slowly I turned\\
362 - step by step, inch by inch\\
363 - I crept up on him.\\
364 - I let him have it.\\
365 - I let him...
Drop it! Drop it!\\
366 - Drop it! Drop it!\\
367 - On the floor?\\
368 - No, let me have it.\\
369 - Okay.\\
370 - What's the matter with you?\\
371 - Are you crazy or something?\\
372 - You said to let you have it.\\
373 - Oh!\\
374 - Oh, you gotta...\\
375 - You're a pretty good sport.\\
376 - Here.\\
377 - Now that you got the idea of the bit\\
378 - you want to try it again?\\
379 - Yeah, but this time, you be the one\\
380 - with the kind face.\\
381 - Okay.\\
382 - (phone rings)\\
383 - Hello.\\
384 - Hello, Lucy, Fred just called me\\
385 - and I think I ought to tell you
before you get too involved\\
386 - Ricky hired those burlesque comics.\\
387 - Ew...\\
388 - (Latin dance music playing)\\
389 - Well, some opening night, huh?\\
390 - Yes.\\
391 - Too bad Lucy was so stubborn.\\
392 - She wouldn't even come down.\\
393 - Did you see Ricky?\\
394 - Yeah, but he couldn't talk to me.\\
395 - Something went wrong backstage.\\
396 - One of the ballet dancers took sick,
and they don't know\\
397 - what they're going to do about the
number.\\
398 - Lucy knows that routine.\\
399 - She learned it from Madame Lamand.\\
400 - Gee, that would be a great break for
her.\\
401 - Yeah.
But what a terrible trick to play on
Ricky.\\
402 - It is not.\\
403 - She'll be fine.\\
404 - I'm going to call her up\\
405 - and tell her to come right now.\\
406 - You go find Ricky\\
407 - and tell him you've got another
dancer.\\
408 - All right.\\
409 - (phone rings)\\
410 - Hello.\\
411 - Hello, Lucy, this is Ethel.
I'm down at the club.\\
412 - Yeah.\\
413 - The most exciting thing just
happened.\\
414 - One of the performers just got sick\\
415 - and can't do the act\\
416 - and you're the only one that knows
the routine.\\
417 - Routine?
You mean "Slowly I Turn"?\\
418 - Yeah, all that turning stuff.\\
419 - You learned it that day, didn't you?\\
420 - I'll say.
Uh, what about my partner?\\
421 - Oh, he's here.\\
422 - Okay, I'll get my costume on, and
I'll be right down.\\
423 - Well, hurry up. You'll just have time
to make it.\\
424 - Okay.\\
425 - (playing song intro)\\
426 - Linda flor de alborada\\
427 - Te brotaste del suelo\\
428 - Cuando la luz del cielo\\
429 - Tu capullo besaba\\
430 - De la rosa y el encanto\\
431 - El penso que te ama tanto\\
432 - Que ya loco de amor siente celos de
la vez\\
433 - Del aire, del sol.\\
434 - Marta, capullito de rosa\\
435 - Marta, del jardin linda flor\\
436 - Dime que feliz mariposa\\
437 - En tu caricia pulsa\\
438 - Arriata del sol\\
439 - Marta, que en tus claras pupilas\\
440 - Brilla una aurora de amor\\
441 - Marta, que en tus ojos azules\\
442 - De infatigable candor\\
443 - De buen huellos, adios.\\
444 - Martha, rambling rose in the wildwood\\
445 - Martha, with a fragrance divine\\
446 - Rosebud of the days of my childhood\\
447 - Watch you bloom in the wildwood\\
448 - And I hope you'll be mine\\
449 - Martha, now your eyes beam at
twilight\\
450 - Sparkling like the dew from a dawn\\
451 - Martha, well, I live for your
love-light\\
452 - I awake with a sigh\\
453 - And I find you are gone\\
454 - Martha, Martha, Martha.\\
455 - Ricky?\\
456 - Ricky?\\
457 - Well, hello, honey.\\
458 - It's about time you got home.\\
459 - Come in, dear.\\
460 - Are you mad at me, honey?\\
461 - Why, of course not, honey.\\
462 - Are you sure?\\
463 - Positive.\\
464 - Come in, honey.\\
465 - Ricky Ricardo!\\
466 - Well, I guess I had it coming to me.\\
467 - Now we're even.\\
468 - Yeah.\\

\subsection {Episode 20: The Young Fans (1952)}
1 - Good morning, honey.\\
2 - Good morning.\\
3 - What are you doing up at the crack of
dawn?\\
4 - It's only 9:30.\\
5 - Well, I'm trying to get out of here\\
6 - without that little monster from next
door following me.\\
7 - Little Peggy Dawson?\\
8 - Yeah, yeah.
I can't get rid of her.\\
9 - Ever since she found out that I'm
Ricky Ricardo\\
10 - she's like a spook.\\
11 - No matter where I go, she's there.\\
12 - She walks with me to the subway in
the morning\\
13 - she shows up at rehearsal\\
14 - and the way she looks at me--
ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
15 - Well, you know how teenage girls are.\\
16 - They get these fabulous crushes on
men\\
17 - for no reason at all.\\
18 - Yeah, well, I...\\
19 - What do you mean, "for no reason at
all"?\\
20 - Oh, you know what I mean.\\
21 - She thinks the sun rises and sets in
you.\\
22 - Of course, I don't know where she
ever got the idea\\
23 - that you're the smartest, the
handsomest\\
24 - the most talented man in the whole
world.\\
25 - Neither do I.\\
26 - There are a few other men smarter
than I.\\
27 - Why, you big ham!\\
28 - Well, anyway, I can't go through this
cow-eyed routine\\
29 - for another morning.\\
30 - I got to get out of here.\\
31 - Oh, now, you've got plenty of time.\\
32 - Nobody in their right mind would
expect you to be up\\
33 - for another two hours yet.\\
34 - Oh, I guess you're right.\\
35 - Drink another cup of coffee.
I'll get your coat.\\
36 - All right, honey.
Thank you.\\
37 - Am I going crazy or something?\\
38 - No.\\
39 - Oh, Peggy.\\
40 - Good morning... Ricky.\\
41 - Good morning.\\
42 - Did I startle you?\\
43 - Oh, no, no.\\
44 - I always wash my hands in the coffee
every morning.\\
45 - My, that's interesting!\\
46 - Yeah.\\
47 - You go right ahead and eat your
breakfast.\\
48 - Don't let me bother you.\\
49 - Now, look, Peggy, I-I have something
to say to you.\\
50 - What?\\
51 - Uh...\\
52 - Well, now, look, uh, uh, Peggy\\
53 - y-you're a very sweet girl, dear.\\
54 - Oh, you called me "dear"!\\
55 - Now I can die happy.\\
56 - Well, uh, look, look, Pe-Peggy...\\
57 - Yes, Ricky darling.\\
58 - I'll be right back.\\
59 - Lucy, Lucy.\\
60 - What?\\
61 - This is not my day.\\
62 - Look, Lucy, will you do me a favor,
honey?\\
63 - Oh, you called me "honey"!\\
64 - Oh, now I can die happy.\\
65 - Now, cut it out, will you?\\
66 - May I have your autograph, Ricky?\\
67 - Just tattoo it on my arm.\\
68 - Now, that's enough of that, honey.\\
69 - How am I going to get rid of her?\\
70 - Why don't you disillusion her?\\
71 - How?\\
72 - Just go in there and be mean and
nasty and unattractive.\\
73 - I'm not that good an actor.\\
74 - There must be some way.\\
75 - Of course.\\
76 - I know the perfect way for me to
straighten her out.\\
77 - How?\\
78 - You talk to her.\\
79 - Me?
Yep. I got to go to rehearsal.\\
80 - Good-bye, honey.\\
81 - But Ricky, what'll I say?\\
82 - Well, honey, you're so clever, you'll
think of something.\\
83 - Good-bye.\\
84 - Good-bye, you coward.\\
85 - Oh, Peggy...\\
86 - Oh, Peggy, you scared me.\\
87 - Is Mr. Ricardo ready to go to work?\\
88 - He's gone.\\
89 - Oh! Gosh, I'll have to catch up with
him.\\
90 - Oh, now, Peggy, wait a minute.\\
91 - But I walk him to the subway every
morning.\\
92 - Yeah, well, he's a big boy now.\\
93 - He can find it by himself.\\
94 - Uh, sit down, Peggy.\\
95 - I want to have a little talk with
you.\\
96 - All right.\\
97 - That's a good idea, really.\\
98 - I want to have a talk with you, too.\\
99 - Now, look, Peggy...\\
100 - Mrs. Ricardo, let's be adult about
this.\\
101 - I'm in love with your husband.\\
102 - Are you sure about what you're
saying, Peggy?\\
103 - Do you know it's love and not
infatuation?\\
104 - Oh, yes.\\
105 - My infatuations only last a little
while.\\
106 - This has been going on for two whole
weeks.\\
107 - "Two whole weeks."\\
108 - Well, there's a little thing you
overlooked, Peggy--\\
109 - Ricky is married.\\
110 - I know.\\
111 - Doesn't that make it sophisticated?\\
112 - Well, yes.\\
113 - And he's so much more worldly than
the boys I know.\\
114 - Well, I should hope so.\\
115 - He's a little older, too.\\
116 - I know-- he's middle-aged.\\
117 - What?\\
118 - He must be pushing 23.\\
119 - Yeah, he's pushing 23, all right.\\
120 - In fact, he's pushed it all the way
to 35.\\
121 - I suppose you think that I'm pushing
23, too?\\
122 - Oh, no.\\
123 - A woman can always tell another
woman's age.\\
124 - Yes, well...
now, about Ricky.\\
125 - You know, there's another thing you
overlooked, Peggy.\\
126 - What?
I love him, too.\\
127 - I was afraid of that.\\
128 - You're going to be terrific
competition.\\
129 - Well, thanks.\\
130 - Gosh, you've got that certain
something.\\
131 - Well, that's-that's quite a
compliment\\
132 - but, uh, how would a girl your age
know\\
133 - that I have that certain something?\\
134 - I can tell by the way my mother looks
at my father\\
135 - when my father looks at you.\\
136 - I hope we can get this settled by
Saturday night\\
137 - so that Ricky can take me to the
school dance.\\
138 - Well, now, look, Peggy, I want to
have a talk with you\\
139 - not as a rival but as a... a...\\
140 - A mother?\\
141 - No, a friend.\\
142 - Now, what about boys your own age?\\
143 - Oh, they're all so icky.\\
144 - They're icky, huh?\\
145 - Yeah...
except Arthur!\\
146 - Arthur?\\
147 - Arthur Morton.\\
148 - He's wonderful.\\
149 - He's got curly hair, big sad eyes and
floppy ears.\\
150 - He looks like Gregory Peck.\\
151 - Sounds more like Lassie.\\
152 - But if you like Arthur so much\\
153 - why don't you go to the school dance
with him?\\
154 - Oh, he's too shy to ask me.\\
155 - Well, why don't you ask him?\\
156 - He doesn't know how to dance.\\
157 - Oh.
Well, how about this?\\
158 - Now, suppose someone taught him to
dance by Saturday.\\
159 - Would you ask him to take you?\\
160 - Oh, sure.\\
161 - Okay, I'll teach him.\\
162 - Do you still know how to dance?\\
163 - I think I can recall a few variations
on the turkey trot.\\
164 - Now, look, you tell Arthur to come
here right after school\\
165 - and have his first lesson.\\
166 - Okay. Oh, gosh, I'm going to be late.\\
167 - Oh, uh, Mrs. Ricardo?\\
168 - Yes?\\
169 - Don't say anything about Arthur.\\
170 - I don't want Ricky to know that...
I'm untrue.\\
171 - Well, your secret is safe, Peggy.\\
172 - Gee, you're keen.\\
173 - Bye.\\
174 - Bye.\\
175 - "Gee, you're keen."\\
176 - Arthur?\\
177 - Come in, Arthur.\\
178 - Come in.\\
179 - How do you do?\\
180 - I'm Mrs. Ricardo.\\
181 - Won't you sit down?\\
182 - Can I get you a drink of water?\\
183 - Arthur, say something!\\
184 - I think I'm going to faint.\\
185 - Now, nonsense.\\
186 - There's nothing to be shy about.\\
187 - I'm just going to teach you how to
dance, that's all.\\
188 - Well, look, we'll start this way.\\
189 - Now, you just watch my feet.\\
190 - Now, one, two, three, four.\\
191 - One, two, three, four.\\
192 - That's all there is to it.\\
193 - Oh, is that all?\\
194 - Yeah. Now, you try it.\\
195 - Now, one, two, three, four.\\
196 - One, two, three, four.\\
197 - One, two...\\
198 - Arthur, Arthur...\\
199 - take shorter steps.\\
200 - You'll be dancing with a girl, not an
antelope.\\
201 - Oh.\\
202 - Now, try it again.\\
203 - Now, one, two, three, four.\\
204 - One, two, sidestep.\\
205 - That's right, sidestep, that's it.\\
206 - Gee, is this all there is to dancing?\\
207 - Yes.\\
208 - Well, this is easy.\\
209 - Yeah, I knew you'd catch on.\\
210 - There now.\\
211 - Let's try it together.\\
212 - Oh, now, come on, Arthur.\\
213 - What are you going to do to me?\\
214 - I'm not going to do anything to you.\\
215 - We're just going to dance together.\\
216 - You mean...
just the two of us?\\
217 - Yes, that's the usual number.\\
218 - Mrs. Ricardo, I can't dance with you.\\
219 - You're a... a woman.\\
220 - Yeah, my husband likes me that way.\\
221 - Well, I don't know...
a... a woman...\\
222 - Now, look, Arthur\\
223 - some people are men and some people
are women.\\
224 - They're made that way so they can
dance together.\\
225 - Now, come on.
Take hold of me.\\
226 - Oh, Arthur, we're not dancing the
minuet.\\
227 - Put your arms around me.\\
228 - Oh, I couldn't.\\
229 - Now, don't be silly.\\
230 - Now, come on.\\
231 - Now, just follow me.\\
232 - Now, come on.\\
233 - Now, one, two, three, four.\\
234 - One, two, three, four.\\
235 - Arthur, relax.\\
236 - Relax, now.\\
237 - Loosen up, come on.\\
238 - Just let yourself go loose, that's
all.\\
239 - Now, just relax.\\
240 - Now, come on, follow me.\\
241 - Now, relax.\\
242 - Now, be light on your feet, now.\\
243 - Li-Light on my feet.\\
244 - Yeah. Now, follow me.\\
245 - One, two, three, four.\\
246 - One, two, three, four.\\
247 - Oh! Oh, gosh!\\
248 - I'm sorry.\\
249 - Oh, that's all right.\\
250 - Okay.\\
251 - Now, come on, let's try it again.\\
252 - Light on my feet.\\
253 - Yeah.
Now, try it again.\\
254 - Now, one, two, three, four.\\
255 - One, two...\\
256 - three, four...
One...\\
257 - Oh! Oh!\\
258 - I-I'm sorry.
I did it again.\\
259 - You don't think this last time broke
it?\\
260 - No, the first time broke it.\\
261 - Well, I'll try to be more careful.\\
262 - Okay, now, come on.\\
263 - Light on my feet.\\
264 - Yeah, light on your feet.\\
265 - Come on.\\
266 - One, two, three, four.\\
267 - One, two, three, four.\\
268 - One, two, three, four.\\
269 - That's right, now you're getting it.\\
270 - There, that's fine.\\
271 - Now we'll try it with the music.\\
272 - Well, Arthur, let me go.\\
273 - Arthur, what's the matter with you?\\
274 - Why don't you let me go?\\
275 - I like it.\\
276 - But, Arthur...\\
277 - Mrs. Ricardo...\\
278 - What?\\
279 - I love you.\\
280 - What do you mean, you love me?\\
281 - I love you.
I love you!\\
282 - Arthur, relax, now, relax.\\
283 - Calm down.\\
284 - Now, relax.\\
285 - Gosh, this is the first time\\
286 - I've ever had my arms around a woman.\\
287 - Now I know what all the fellas are
talking about.\\
288 - Now, Arthur.\\
289 - I love you.\\
290 - Stop saying that.\\
291 - Now, Arthur, th-there's a big
misunderstanding.\\
292 - You better go now.\\
293 - No, I'm never going away from you,
ever.\\
294 - Now, Arthur...\\
295 - Let's dance some more.\\
296 - No, no, you dance by yourself.\\
297 - Oh, no.\\
298 - Come on, now.\\
299 - Let's see how much you've learned\\
300 - and then, maybe I'll dance with you.\\
301 - Now, go on.\\
302 - Well... all right.\\
303 - Now...\\
304 - one, two, sidestep.\\
305 - Three, four, sidestep.\\
306 - That's it, sidestep.\\
307 - Three, four, sidestep.\\
308 - Sidestep, sidestep, sidestep.\\
309 - That's it, sidestep, sidestep, three,
four.\\
310 - Sidestep, that's it.\\
311 - The stairs!\\
312 - Arthur, watch out for the st...\\
313 - Oh, no!\\
314 - Hi, honey.\\
315 - Hi.\\
316 - What's the matter?\\
317 - I gave Arthur a dancing lesson.\\
318 - Arthur? Arthur who?\\
319 - Well, believe me, it wasn't Arthur
Murray.\\
320 - Would you mind telling a poor
confused Cuban\\
321 - what you're talking about?\\
322 - Well, after you left this morning\\
323 - I had that little chat with Peggy.\\
324 - Yeah?\\
325 - And she said that she liked a boy
named Arthur Morton\\
326 - Yeah?
but that he didn't know how to dance.\\
327 - So I had Arthur come over here\\
328 - and I gave him a dancing lesson to
get Peggy off your neck.\\
329 - What are you whispering about?\\
330 - If my feet ever find out that it was
my idea\\
331 - they'll kill me.\\
332 - Well, I knew you'd figure a simple
way\\
333 - to clear the entire situation.\\
334 - Simple? I may never walk again.\\
335 - Well, listen, honey, thank you very
much.\\
336 - Can I forget about Peggy now?\\
337 - I hope so.\\
338 - Hey, you know, this Arthur was so shy\\
339 - I practically had to lasso him to get
him in here.\\
340 - No kidding?\\
341 - Yeah. It was really unbelievable.\\
342 - And then, after we'd been dancing\\
343 - for a couple of minutes, he suddenly
looked me in the eye\\
344 - and said, "I love you."\\
345 - Oh, no.\\
346 - Yeah.\\
347 - That's very funny.\\
348 - In love with you!\\
349 - That's a scream.\\
350 - Ha, ha.\\
351 - Oh, now, honey, you must admit it's
pretty funny.\\
352 - Look, I'll admit I'm old enough to be
his... sister...\\
353 - but his being in love with me isn't
that funny.\\
354 - You fell in love with me once, you
know.\\
355 - I sure did, sweetheart.\\
356 - Hello.\\
357 - Oh, hello, Peggy.\\
358 - Oh, Peggy, I don't know what
you're...\\
359 - Well, Peggy, I didn't mean to...\\
360 - Oh, well, now, dear, you're jumping
to concl...\\
361 - But, Peggy, I...\\
362 - Hello, Peggy?\\
363 - Peggy?\\
364 - Peggy is coming over.\\
365 - What for?\\
366 - She says now that I've taken Arthur
away from her\\
367 - she ought to get you.\\
368 - Well, why didn't you tell her not to
come over?\\
369 - I couldn't get a word in edgewise.\\
370 - No, no, no, I'll get it this time.\\
371 - Now, listen here, Peggy...\\
372 - Oh, hello, Arthur.\\
373 - Yeah, I know, Arthur.\\
374 - Well, now, look, after all...\\
375 - Now, look, Arthur, you can't...\\
376 - Arthur?\\
377 - Arthur?\\
378 - Arthur is coming over, too.\\
379 - Oh, no.\\
380 - Yeah. He said he wants\\
381 - to have a man-to-man talk with me
about you.\\
382 - Oh, swell, here we are in the middle
of a four-sided triangle.\\
383 - And it's all your fault.\\
384 - This never would've happened\\
385 - if you hadn't learned to play that
lousy conga drum.\\
386 - Never mind that.\\
387 - We got to figure a way to discourage
them.\\
388 - Well, pointing up that we're too old
for them won't work.\\
389 - I tried that with Peggy.\\
390 - Didn't make the slightest impression.\\
391 - Well, maybe, uh, you didn't make us
old enough.\\
392 - Hey, you know...\\
393 - maybe you got something there,
Grandpa.\\
394 - Yeah. Yeah.\\
395 - That's what I mean, Grandma.\\
396 - Hey, come on, we've got a lot of
aging to do.\\
397 - Okay.\\
398 - Well...\\
399 - How is this?\\
400 - That's pretty good\\
401 - but you can't talk with such a young
voice.\\
402 - Oh. Uh...\\
403 - Is this any better?\\
404 - Yeah, that's better\\
405 - but don't tell me a man your age
still has teeth.\\
406 - Oh, uh...\\
407 - Is this all right, Grandma?\\
408 - Oh, no!\\
409 - I used to think I'd enjoy growing old
with you\\
410 - but after this preview, you'd better
grow old alone.\\
411 - Never mind that.\\
412 - Listen, how about you?\\
413 - You don't look very old.\\
414 - Oh, don't worry about me.\\
415 - I have a few plans.\\
416 - I may misplace my
teeth, too.\\
417 - Well, that'll help.\\
418 - Yeah, kiss me, Grandpa.\\
419 - All right.\\
420 - Ooh, there's one of them now.\\
421 - All right.
Get out of sight.\\
422 - Mrs. Ricardo, this is a terrible
thing\\
423 - that you've done to me.\\
424 - I'm disappointed in you.\\
425 - Oh, well, girlie, I'm so sorry.\\
426 - Sit down, we'll have a little talk.\\
427 - What?\\
428 - Oh, pardon me.\\
429 - Oh, dear, I always forget those
things.\\
430 - There, now, sit down.\\
431 - We'll have a girl-to-girl talk.\\
432 - Those teeth, aren't they yours?\\
433 - Well, they sure are.\\
434 - I made the last payment two months
ago.\\
435 - Gosh, you're even older than I
thought.\\
436 - Well!\\
437 - I can see why you're so afraid of
losing Ricky\\
438 - but now that you've stolen Arthur\\
439 - I can't let that make\\
440 - any difference to me.\\
441 - Well, I think you're absolutely
right.\\
442 - You do?\\
443 - Absolutely, Ricky is yours.\\
444 - Gee, Mrs. Ricardo, thanks.\\
445 - Oh, that's all right.\\
446 - It's really nothing.\\
447 - I'll get him for you.\\
448 - Oh, Peggy, I-I-I must, uh, warn you.\\
449 - You know, Ricky isn't as young as you
think he is either.\\
450 - Oh, don't try to scare me, Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
451 - I've seen him when he comes in for
breakfast.\\
452 - Oh, well, he's all put together by
then.\\
453 - "Put together"?\\
454 - Oh, yeah. You should see him when he
wakes up in the morning.\\
455 - He's scattered all over the place.\\
456 - Yeah, well, uh, you see\\
457 - us show people know a lot of makeup
tricks.\\
458 - We can look young whenever we want
to.\\
459 - Oh, you can't frighten me.\\
460 - Well, all right, Peggy, have it your
way.\\
461 - I'll turn him over to you.\\
462 - I'll go get him.\\
463 - Oh...\\
464 - Ricky is mine at last.\\
465 - Ah, hello, Peggy.\\
466 - Oh, Ricky, you're...\\
467 - Old man!\\
468 - Yes, yes.\\
469 - Isn't that wonderful?\\
470 - We'll be so happy together.\\
471 - But... Oh, but this must be some sort
of a joke.\\
472 - You must be Ricky Ricardo's father.\\
473 - Oh, no, no, no.\\
474 - It's me, all right...\\
475 - Yeah, the one and only Ricky Ricardo.\\
476 - That's right, you show them, dear.\\
477 - All right, Mother.\\
478 - All right.\\
479 - iBabalu!\\
480 - iBabalu, aye!\\
481 - Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.\\
482 - What's the matter?\\
483 - Wh-What's the matter?\\
484 - Well, it's his rheumatism.\\
485 - Rheumatism?\\
486 - Yeah, he has very...\\
487 - Put his legs up on the coffee table
there, will you, dear?\\
488 - That's right.\\
489 - Be careful, now, when you pull them.\\
490 - Look out, now.\\
491 - Watch out.\\
492 - That's right.\\
493 - Yeah, now, jiggle them.\\
494 - "Jiggle them"?\\
495 - Yeah, you have to keep them moving\\
496 - or his arteries harden.\\
497 - Go ahead, jiggle them.\\
498 - I'll fill this up, dear.\\
499 - Thank you.\\
500 - Oh, dear, I-I don't understand this
whole thing.\\
501 - Your hair, Ricky, when did it get
white?\\
502 - Oh, oh, that's right.\\
503 - You never saw my hair this way, did
you?\\
504 - No.\\
505 - Well, you see, I don't bother with
the shoeblack at home.\\
506 - Keep jiggling, Peggy.
Please, keep jiggling.\\
507 - Is that better?\\
508 - Yes, that's better.\\
509 - You know, you're a much better
jiggler than Lucy.\\
510 - Yeah.\\
511 - Thanks.\\
512 - Okay. All right.\\
513 - I can't believe this whole thing.\\
514 - Why, I just saw you at rehearsal
yesterday\\
515 - dancing around and beating your conga
drum.\\
516 - Oh, yes.\\
517 - Well... I'm glad you saw that, yes.\\
518 - That was my farewell performance.\\
519 - Yeah, he's baba'd his last loo.\\
520 - Thank you.
Thank you.\\
521 - Oh, I'll get it.\\
522 - Keep jiggling.\\
523 - Yeah, keep jiggling, please.\\
524 - Where's Mr. Ricardo?\\
525 - Look, Mr. Ricardo\\
526 - let's be adult about this.\\
527 - I...\\
528 - Ay!\\
529 - What happened to him?\\
530 - He's old.\\
531 - This is the first time we've seen him\\
532 - without shoeblack on his hair.\\
533 - Oh. Well, look, Mr. Ricardo...\\
534 - Oh, Arthur, not another word.\\
535 - I'm happy.\\
536 - I have Peggy.\\
537 - Yeah.\\
538 - Keep jiggling, Peggy.
Please, keep jiggling.\\
539 - Go to Lucy, Arthur.\\
540 - She's all yours.\\
541 - Uh, we'll be very happy together,
Arthur.\\
542 - Of course, I'll miss the old
gentleman.\\
543 - He's the only one that knew\\
544 - how to put the batteries in my
hearing aid.\\
545 - Your hearing aid?\\
546 - Yes. You don't mind, do you?\\
547 - Oh, no, no.\\
548 - I still love you.\\
549 - How's that?\\
550 - I said, I still love you.\\
551 - Oh, yes, sir, it sure does.\\
552 - No!\\
553 - I said, I still love you!\\
554 - Oh, no. Oh, no, thanks.\\
555 - Never touch the stuff.\\
556 - Peggy, please, keep jiggling, please.\\
557 - I never knew you wore glasses.\\
558 - How's that?\\
559 - The glasses!\\
560 - I said, I never knew you wore
glasses!\\
561 - Oh, well, I don't really need them.\\
562 - I can see just as well without them.\\
563 - Hello, Arthur?\\
564 - Arthur?\\
565 - Where'd he go?\\
566 - Oh!\\
567 - Oh, there you are.\\
568 - Gee, Arthur...\\
569 - th-they're both falling apart.\\
570 - Well, Mrs. Ricardo doesn't look so
old.\\
571 - She's kind of...
well preserved.\\
572 - At least her hair isn't white.\\
573 - Oh, sonny, do you like my hair?\\
574 - Yeah.\\
575 - Well, here, you can have it.\\
576 - The part of Peggy was
played by Janet Walden.\\
577 - The part of Arthur was played by Dick
Crenna.

\subsection {Episode 21: New Neighbors (1952)}
1 - Gee, two vanloads of furniture.\\
2 - What can they do with so much junk?\\
3 - Mmm. Where'd they ever get that sofa?\\
4 - Isn't that a...?\\
5 - Are you still hanging out that
window?\\
6 - Now, come on, honey...\\
7 - I want my breakfast.\\
8 - There's some coffee over there.\\
9 - I'll make you some soft-boiled chairs
in a minute.\\
10 - What?
I mean, eggs.\\
11 - Look at those chairs, will you,
Ethel?\\
12 - Ugh.\\
13 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
14 - Hi, Ricks.\\
15 - Hello, Fred.\\
16 - Ethel up here?\\
17 - Oh, there she is.\\
18 - The nosy twins.\\
19 - They've been hanging out that window\\
20 - for an hour, snooping.\\
21 - You'd think they'd never seen anyone
move into an apartment before.\\
22 - Do you want some coffee?
No, thanks.\\
23 - Ethel, look at those china lamps.\\
24 - He shouldn't try to balance that lamp\\
25 - on that table like that.\\
26 - Oh, honey, now, those moving men know
what they're doing.\\
27 - They never drop any...\\
28 - Oh...
Oh...\\
29 - Well, I guess one lamp's better than
none.\\
30 - Ethel, come out of that window.\\
31 - Suppose the new tenant should see
you.\\
32 - There's nobody down there but the
moving men.\\
33 - They won't be satisfied until they
see every last bit\\
34 - of those people's, uh, paraphernalia.\\
35 - Par...\\
36 - Que no va a estar conforme\\
37 - hasta que no ven el ultimo trasto\\
38 - de los nuevos vecinos.\\
39 - Oh, paraphernalia.\\
40 - You understand Spanish?\\
41 - No.\\
42 - Now, come out of there, both of you.\\
43 - Come on! You've done enough snooping.\\
44 - We're not snooping.\\
45 - I'm surprised they're not using
binoculars.\\
46 - Oh, I forgot I had them.\\
47 - Say, that must be the new tenant
coming up now.\\
48 - Isn't he handsome?\\
49 - "Handsome"?\\
50 - How can you call him handsome\\
51 - with those bugged-out eyes and long
hairy legs?\\
52 - Huh?\\
53 - Hey, you got a fly on the lens.\\
54 - Oh!\\
55 - Ooh, say, he is handsome.\\
56 - Let me see through those things.\\
57 - Ethel!\\
58 - Curiosity killed the cat, eh, Fred?\\
59 - Yeah, but we'll never get a break
like that.\\
60 - Now, why can't they wait until
tomorrow\\
61 - to see what those people look like?\\
62 - I don't know.\\
63 - It doesn't make any difference to me\\
64 - what they look like.\\
65 - Me, neither.\\
66 - Hey, who was that?\\
67 - Do you suppose that could be his
wife?\\
68 - Look at that gorgeous
blond hair.\\
69 - Ethel Mertz!\\
70 - How do you dare let a woman like that\\
71 - that has a figure like that, come
into this building?\\
72 - Just a minute.
That's the biggest mista...\\
73 - Nothing doing.
Give me that, will you?
Hey, fellas!\\
74 - Fred, give me that thing!\\
75 - Fellas, watch it, will you?\\
76 - Gee, I'm sure glad men aren't nosy.\\
77 - Yeah.\\
78 - Wow, wow.\\
79 - All right, fellas, break it up, will
you?\\
80 - We were here first.
Get your own window.\\
81 - Ah... they gone inside.\\
82 - That's all, girls.\\
83 - Yeah, the show is over.
Here.\\
84 - Well, something tells me\\
85 - I'm going to be doing a lot of
repairing\\
86 - in that apartment.\\
87 - Ah...\\
88 - You need a helper?\\
89 - Have you got a card?\\
90 - I'll join.\\
91 - Okay, Ethel, what's the dirt on the
new tenants?\\
92 - Where are they from?\\
93 - I don't know.\\
94 - What business is he in?\\
95 - I don't know.\\
96 - Do they have any children?\\
97 - I don't know.\\
98 - What's the matter with you? Your
radar bent?\\
99 - No, they rented the apartment through
an agent.\\
100 - All I know is their name is O'Brien\\
101 - she's a blond, and they've got one
broken lamp.\\
102 - Well, what are we waiting for?\\
103 - Let's go down and call on them.
Okay, let's go.\\
104 - Now, now, wait a minute, Ethel.\\
105 - Give them a chance to get settled.\\
106 - Yeah, I guess he's right.\\
107 - No sense rushing things.\\
108 - Okay, let's go.\\
109 - Lucy, come on!\\
110 - Well, I'm trying to, but there's a
very strong current here.\\
111 - Ricky, let go.
Come here, Lucy.\\
112 - You're not going to go downstairs.\\
113 - Why not?\\
114 - Because there's nothing downstairs
that concerns you.\\
115 - You'll have to give me a better
reason than that.\\
116 - You just go in the kitchen and fix my
breakfast.\\
117 - Oh... we'll go down later, Ethel.\\
118 - His majesty is hungry.\\
119 - Okay, there's plenty of time.\\
120 - His majesty has another proclamation.\\
121 - I don't want you to go down there at
all.\\
122 - "At all" as in "never"?\\
123 - Right.\\
124 - Now, repeat after me:\\
125 - I, Lucy Ricardo, promise never to set
foot\\
126 - in the O'Brien apartment.\\
127 - Oh, really.\\
128 - Come on.\\
129 - I, Lucy Ricardo, promise never to set
foot...\\
130 - Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a
minute.\\
131 - Uh-huh.\\
132 - Now.\\
133 - I, Lucy Ricardo, promise never to set
foot\\
134 - in the O'Brien apartment-- okay?\\
135 - Okay.\\
136 - Okay.\\
137 - Information.\\
138 - Do you have a telephone number\\
139 - for O'Brien, 623 East 68th Street?\\
140 - They just moved in today.\\
141 - One moment, please.\\
142 - Fred, are you going to be long?\\
143 - I want to use the phone.\\
144 - No, no, I'll just be a minute.\\
145 - I thought I'd call downstairs\\
146 - and see if there's anything\\
147 - they wanted me to do...
Are you calling the O'Briens?\\
148 - They'll call you if they want
anything done.\\
149 - You're never too busy to do anything\\
150 - when there's a blond around.\\
151 - Are you calling them?\\
152 - How can you think a thing like that?\\
153 - Oh, hello, Mr. Thompson?\\
154 - How's the plumbing holding up down
there?\\
155 - Well, good.\\
156 - No, no, no, not at all, thanks.\\
157 - Help yourself.\\
158 - The number for the O'Briens is Murray
Hill 5-9-5-7-0.\\
159 - Stick 'em up.\\
160 - Tom, you scared me to death.\\
161 - Hiya, baby.\\
162 - Hi. Put this on the mantel for me,
will you?\\
163 - Forget about unpacking.
We've got a script to learn.\\
164 - But, Tom, this place...
Look, honey, this television show
goes on Friday night.\\
165 - We don't even know our lines yet.\\
166 - Well, I know mine.\\
167 - All right, smarty.\\
168 - I'll help you with yours.\\
169 - Good. Now, let's see.\\
170 - I think I know that first scene,
baby.\\
171 - Let's start with the second one.\\
172 - All right.\\
173 - Now, where are we?\\
174 - Are you sure this
is the right place?\\
175 - I am positive.\\
176 - They live in this building on an
upper floor.\\
177 - Good.\\
178 - Let me go over the plan with you once
more.\\
179 - We do away with them both--\\
180 - dispose of the bodies and assume
their identities.\\
181 - We become them, yes?\\
182 - Exactly.\\
183 - It is dangerous\\
184 - but it is our only chance to stay in
this country\\
185 - so we can blow up the capital.\\
186 - Shh!\\
187 - You know, that's
pretty corny dialogue.\\
188 - Yeah, even for television.\\
189 - Well, it's a living.\\
190 - Let's see, where were we?\\
191 - You know, my little
chicken, this job will not be easy.\\
192 - They're clever and physically strong.\\
193 - "Physically
strong"...\\
194 - "Physically strong"...
Yeah, I thought you knew your part,
baby.\\
195 - That's the first one I've missed.\\
196 - It's, "Especially..."\\
197 - Especially the
red-haired one.\\
198 - Did you notice those big bulging
muscles\\
199 - those-those popping eyes\\
200 - and-and that horrible, ugly, leering
face?\\
201 - I will take care of that one,
silently\\
202 - with a knife in the back.\\
203 - You will handle the other.\\
204 - I will, on one condition--\\
205 - that you take me out to lunch.\\
206 - Huh?\\
207 - It's 3:00 and I'm starved.
Ah.\\
208 - I haven't had anything to eat since
breakfast.\\
209 - All right.\\
210 - Come on, let's go down to the
drugstore and have a sandwich.\\
211 - We can finish rehearsing when we get
back.\\
212 - Okay, baby.\\
213 - I will take care of
that one, silently\\
214 - with a knife in the back.\\
215 - Hey...\\
216 - Oh.\\
217 - Wait.\\
218 - Good, they have not seen us.\\
219 - The coast is clear.\\
220 - Darling, you're such a
fool.\\
221 - You know, baby, I think we're going
to like this place.\\
222 - Mrs. O'Brien?\\
223 - Mrs. O'Brien, it's me, the landlady.\\
224 - Is there anything I can help you
with?\\
225 - Mrs. O'Brien?\\
226 - Ew.\\
227 - Hi, Ethel.\\
228 - Lucy.\\
229 - What about your promise?\\
230 - Well, I promised Ricky\\
231 - I wouldn't set foot in this apartment\\
232 - but that doesn't mean I can't stay
out here in the hall\\
233 - and give a long-distance snoop.\\
234 - Aren't they home?\\
235 - No.\\
236 - I had to wait all morning and half
the afternoon\\
237 - for them to leave.\\
238 - What'd you find?\\
239 - Well...\\
240 - Lucy, what period is this?\\
241 - 19th-century provincial?\\
242 - Looks like 20th-century ugly.\\
243 - What else is there?\\
244 - These lamps.\\
245 - Now that I see these lamps up close\\
246 - it's too bad they didn't drop both of
them.\\
247 - Where are they?\\
248 - Here.\\
249 - Oh...\\
250 - Gosh, this is the most frustrating
thing\\
251 - that ever happened to me.\\
252 - Wait, I'll bring one over to you.\\
253 - No, listen-- just because I promised
Ricky\\
254 - that I wouldn't set foot in this
apartment\\
255 - doesn't mean I can't set knees in.\\
256 - So long as I keep my feet off the
floor\\
257 - I'm an honest woman, right?\\
258 - He better see his dentist.\\
259 - Oh, fine thing-- she removed all the
price tags.\\
260 - Hey, look at this.\\
261 - What is that?\\
262 - Early Pullman.\\
263 - Lucy!\\
264 - Ricky's home.\\
265 - Lucy!\\
266 - He's coming down here.
What'll I do?\\
267 - Hide someplace.
I'll get rid of him.\\
268 - But where?\\
269 - In the closet.\\
270 - Oh, hi, Ethel.\\
271 - I have a perfect right to be here.\\
272 - Who said you didn't?\\
273 - Well, uh...\\
274 - I just came up to see\\
275 - if everything was all right, and
everything's all right.\\
276 - Well, let's go.\\
277 - You seen Lucy?\\
278 - Lucy who?\\
279 - Lucy Ricardo, my wife.\\
280 - Oh, that Lucy.\\
281 - Yeah, that Lucy.\\
282 - No, I haven't seen her.\\
283 - Let's go.\\
284 - Are you sure this
is the right place?\\
285 - I am positive.\\
286 - They live in this building\\
287 - on an upper floor.\\
288 - Good.\\
289 - Let me go over the plan with you once
more.\\
290 - We do away with them both--\\
291 - dispose of the bodies and assume
their identities.\\
292 - We become them, yes?\\
293 - Exactly.\\
294 - It is dangerous\\
295 - but it is our only chance to stay in
this country\\
296 - so we can blow up the capital.\\
297 - Shh!\\
298 - You know, my little chicken\\
299 - this job will not be easy.\\
300 - They are clever and physically
strong.\\
301 - Especially the red-haired one.\\
302 - Did you notice...\\
303 - did you notice those big bulging
muscles\\
304 - those popping eyes\\
305 - and that horrible, ugly, leering
face?\\
306 - I will take care of that one,
silently\\
307 - with a knife in the back.\\
308 - You will handle the other.\\
309 - Do not worry.\\
310 - In a dark alley\\
311 - a loop of silver wire around the
neck.\\
312 - One tug-- poof!\\
313 - Wait...\\
314 - I do not know if you actually realize\\
315 - the importance of this mission.\\
316 - What a great honor it is for you and
I\\
317 - to have been chosen to perform it.\\
318 - It is a crowning glory.\\
319 - It makes us the most trusted agents\\
320 - in our nation's service.\\
321 - I am overwhelmed with pride.\\
322 - Darling...\\
323 - when this assignment is over\\
324 - and we return to our native homeland\\
325 - I will tell you something\\
326 - that I have wanted to say to you for
a long, long time.\\
327 - Tell me now.\\
328 - No, there is no time for personal
emotion.\\
329 - We have a job to do.\\
330 - That is all that counts.\\
331 - Tell me now.\\
332 - No.\\
333 - I think I can guess.\\
334 - What do you think it is?\\
335 - Tell me.\\
336 - No, guess.\\
337 - Kiss me.\\
338 - Ah, you guessed.\\
339 - Enough of this.\\
340 - We are on a sacred mission.\\
341 - We cannot be weak.\\
342 - You are right\\
343 - but I'll remember this until we can
be weak again.\\
344 - Now, my little chicken\\
345 - are all our preparations in order?\\
346 - Now, my little chicken...\\
347 - Now, my little chicken, are all our
preparations in...\\
348 - Now, my little chicken, are all our
preparations in order?\\
349 - You have the knife?\\
350 - Yes.\\
351 - The silver wire?\\
352 - Yes.\\
353 - The map?\\
354 - Yes.\\
355 - The explosives?\\
356 - Yes.\\
357 - The two-way wrist television set?\\
358 - Yes.\\
359 - Good.\\
360 - I cannot...\\
361 - I cannot think as a patriot.\\
362 - My blood is pounding in my ears.\\
363 - As a woman, I beg of you...\\
364 - be weak again.\\
365 - The roar of my blood is loud and
deep.\\
366 - What a tragedy my life has been up to
now.\\
367 - I see for the first time that to love
is to live.\\
368 - Hey, not bad, eh?\\
369 - That's gin.\\
370 - Aw, Ricky.\\
371 - That's all.\\
372 - Oh, no, let's play one more hand,
Ricky, huh?\\
373 - All right.\\
374 - Oh, there you are, Ethel.\\
375 - Have you got the pass key?\\
376 - I want to check the heat\\
377 - in Miss Lewis's apartment.\\
378 - Lucy, what are you doing?\\
379 - They're after us.
Help me.\\
380 - Well, what happened?\\
381 - What are you talking about?\\
382 - Who's after who?\\
383 - The O'Briens, Ethel.\\
384 - You're nurturing two vipers in your
brownstone bosom.\\
385 - What?\\
386 - Lucy... have you been snooping
downstairs?\\
387 - Yes, I've been snooping\\
388 - and it's a good thing I did, too.\\
389 - Those people are foreign enemy
agents.\\
390 - They're going to rub us out\\
391 - and they're not going to use an
eraser either.\\
392 - Lucy, you mean to tell me that you
went downstairs\\
393 - after you promised me not to?\\
394 - Yes, I've been a bad girl and you can
spank me tomorrow\\
395 - if there's anything left to spank!\\
396 - Well, didn't you hear what I said?\\
397 - What's the matter with you?\\
398 - Our lives are in danger!\\
399 - Now, look, honey\\
400 - why would those people want to give
us a rubdown?\\
401 - Rub us out!\\
402 - I heard them.\\
403 - They're going to kill us and assume
our identities.\\
404 - Why?\\
405 - So they can blow up the capital.\\
406 - "Blow up the capital."\\
407 - Yes!
Now, look, honey...\\
408 - Now, wait a minute.\\
409 - Maybe we better pay attention to
Lucy.\\
410 - After all, she was in their
apartment.\\
411 - Yeah, and I'm going to call the
police.\\
412 - I got to get them over here.\\
413 - We got to save the country.\\
414 - Now, now, look, honey, calm down,
will you?\\
415 - Let's talk this thing over.\\
416 - Now, wait a minute.
A lot of talking you're going to do\\
417 - with a silver wire wrapped around
your neck.\\
418 - Silver wire?\\
419 - Yeah!\\
420 - Aw, honey, you better lie down.\\
421 - Come on, now.
I don't want to lie down!\\
422 - If I go, I want to be...
go standing up fighting.\\
423 - I think it's time to turn on the
furnace.
Good luck, Rick.\\
424 - And you go with him, Ricky.\\
425 - All right.
I'll try to settle her down.\\
426 - Ricky, you're not going to leave me
at a time like this!\\
427 - When you come back, I might be gone!\\
428 - Well, if you go, leave me a note\\
429 - and tell me where I can find my clean
socks.\\
430 - Ricky!\\
431 - Why won't anybody believe me?\\
432 - Oh...
I'm telling you I heard.\\
433 - Oh, come on, now, honey.
I heard it!
I heard it!\\
434 - Calm down.
I know what I heard!\\
435 - Now, Lucy, are you sure you heard
right?\\
436 - Cross my heart and hope to... Oh!\\
437 - Oh, dear.\\
438 - Well, I'm not going to sit here like
a sitting duck.\\
439 - I'm going to call the police.\\
440 - Operator, give me the police.\\
441 - 32nd Precinct.
Sergeant Morton speaking.\\
442 - Help!\\
443 - Name, please.\\
444 - Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.\\
445 - Send a squad of men over right away.\\
446 - Send two squads, the whole force.\\
447 - Address?\\
448 - 623 East 68th Street, and hurry.\\
449 - Now, Mrs. Ricardo, what seems to be
your trouble?\\
450 - Well... some people that moved in
downstairs\\
451 - are plotting to kill us.\\
452 - Do you know these people?\\
453 - No.\\
454 - Then, how do you know they're going
to kill you?\\
455 - I heard them.\\
456 - I-I just happened to be hiding\\
457 - in their closet at the time.\\
458 - I see.\\
459 - And why do you suppose they want to
kill you?\\
460 - So they can assume our identities\\
461 - and blow up the capital.\\
462 - This is serious.\\
463 - You're darn right it is!\\
464 - These people are agents of some
foreign government.\\
465 - What's their names?\\
466 - O'Brien.\\
467 - Lady, have you been nipping on the
cooking sherry?\\
468 - Oh, please, you've got to believe me.\\
469 - I'm-I'm living on borrowed time.\\
470 - It was only by a very clever ruse\\
471 - that I managed to escape from their
apartment\\
472 - right under their eyes.\\
473 - And how did you manage that?\\
474 - I pretended to be a chair.\\
475 - I don't think the police can help
you, madam.\\
476 - Why don't you call an upholsterer?\\
477 - Oh, Officer, please, I'm serious.\\
478 - My life is at stake.\\
479 - What'll I do?\\
480 - Just relax.\\
481 - Take it easy...\\
482 - and in time, you may grow up to be a
nice big sofa!\\
483 - But, Officer...\\
484 - Oh, Officer!
Oh, come on, now, Lucy.\\
485 - Aw, nobody will believe me.
Come on, honey\\
486 - don't you think a good hot bath and a
nice rest\\
487 - I keep telling you what's happening
will help you relax?\\
488 - but nobody will believe me!
But, after all, Lucy...\\
489 - To arms! To arms!
To arms! To arms!\\
490 - What happened?
Lucy's right! Lucy's right!\\
491 - We listened through the furnace pipe.\\
492 - Yeah!
See?\\
493 - Yeah, th-they are planning to kill us\\
494 - and blow up the capital!\\
495 - Yeah, well, now, maybe you'll believe
me\\
496 - when I tell you something.\\
497 - I'm going to call the police right
away!\\
498 - I just did.
They don't care a darn about it.\\
499 - Well, they're not going to get us
without a fight.\\
500 - I'm going to get my rifle!\\
501 - Yeah, and I got two shotguns
downstairs\\
502 - and I'll get them, too.\\
503 - All right, bring both of them.\\
504 - Lock the doors and shut all the
windows!
Yeah.\\
505 - Lock the doors and shut all the
windows.\\
506 - 10:00 in the living room and all's
well!\\
507 - 10:00 in the bedroom and all's
well!\\
508 - 10:00 in the hallway and all's
well!\\
509 - 10:00 in the
kitchen and all's well!\\
510 - Kitchen sentry, report to the living
room.\\
511 - Yes, sir.\\
512 - Ethel, are you eating on duty?\\
513 - No, sir.\\
514 - What's that in your hand?\\
515 - Um...\\
516 - Well, I'm not very good with a gun\\
517 - and I thought if anybody sneaked in
through the back door\\
518 - I'd beat them to death.\\
519 - Well, I hope they get here before you
eat your club away.\\
520 - Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.\\
521 - Fred, what are you doing away from
your post?\\
522 - I'm hungry and I request transfer to
the kitchen.\\
523 - What do you want?\\
524 - I'm lonesome in there all by myself.\\
525 - What's that?
I hear something.\\
526 - I do, too.\\
527 - Be calm. Be calm.\\
528 - Be steady.
Take it easy.\\
529 - Don't get excited.\\
530 - Now, don't shoot till you see the
whites of their eyes.
Okay.\\
531 - Take it easy.
Okay.
Okay.\\
532 - Hello?\\
533 - No, this isn't the city dump.\\
534 - You got the wrong number.\\
535 - Very clever ruse of theirs\\
536 - to find out if we're home or not.\\
537 - Right.
Hey, hey.\\
538 - Go around.
Come here.\\
539 - What's the matter?
Someone's at the door.\\
540 - Okay. Be careful.
Be steady.\\
541 - Be calm.
Get ready.\\
542 - Just don't be trigger-happy now.
Oh?\\
543 - Don't shoot till it's absolutely
necessary.
All right.\\
544 - All right?
Okay.
Okay.\\
545 - Good morning, folks.\\
546 - Good morning.\\
547 - Well, I finally got this thing
straightened out.\\
548 - You have?
You did?
What?\\
549 - Great.
Yeah.\\
550 - The O'Briens are actors.\\
551 - What you heard was a play they were
rehearsing.\\
552 - Eww!\\
553 - You can go now.\\
554 - Mr. Mertz.\\
555 - Yeah?\\
556 - The O'Briens told me to tell you\\
557 - they're moving out of your apartment.\\
558 - Aw... fine.\\
559 - This is all your fault, Lucy.\\
560 - Yes, and you'll pay that rent
till we get another tenant.\\
561 - And one of your trigger-happy
sentinels\\
562 - shot a hole in the hot water pipe.\\
563 - Your whole apartment is flooded.\\
564 - And she'll pay for that, too!\\
565 - Oh, come on, Fred, we better hurry
home.\\

15 - Hey, company for dinner?\\
16 - Uh-huh.\\
17 - Who is it?\\
18 - How do you like the new water
glasses, Ricky?\\
19 - Who's coming for dinner, Lucy?\\
20 - Doesn't the table look beautiful
tonight?\\
21 - Lucy, who is it?\\
22 - Some people.\\
23 - Lucy...\\
24 - Whom is coming here for dinner
tonight?\\
25 - Whom, you mean, besides meem and
youm?\\
26 - Never mind that.
What are their names?\\
27 - Fred and Ethel Mertz.\\
28 - Wait a minute.\\
29 - I thought you said Fred and Ethel had
a big fight\\
30 - and they were mad at each other.\\
31 - They are.\\
32 - I thought you said\\
33 - they weren't speaking to each other.\\
34 - They aren't.\\
35 - And that he was staying at the Y.\\
36 - He is.\\
37 - And she won't let him in the house.\\
38 - She won't.\\
39 - Well, if they are\\
40 - and they aren't and he is and she
won't-- how come?\\
41 - Well, I thought...\\
42 - Lucy Esmeralda Macgillicuddy\\
43 - Ricardo.\\
44 - Yes?\\
45 - I thought we had an understanding\\
46 - that you were not going to mess
around\\
47 - in other people's affairs.\\
48 - But, Ricky...\\
49 - Lucy, sometimes I think that you
don't have\\
50 - anything inside your head.\\
51 - Now, come on.
Let me see.\\
52 - Hey, that picture on the wall is
crooked.\\
53 - Oh, stop.\\
54 - Now, Ricky, I can't stand seeing them
apart like this.\\
55 - I heard Ethel downstairs crying all
morning.\\
56 - I'll bet Fred's eating his heart out
too.\\
57 - Hah!\\
58 - What do you mean, hah?\\
59 - How would you like to be separated
from me\\
60 - for three whole days.\\
61 - Ah!\\
62 - Oh... Now really, Ricky, it's up to
us\\
63 - to get Fred and Ethel back together
again.\\
64 - Say you'll help me.\\
65 - Well, it would be nice.\\
66 - Yeah.\\
67 - And I guess\\
68 - after you've gone through all this
trouble\\
69 - and this far that the cast is dead.\\
70 - "The cast is dead"?\\
71 - Yeah, you know...\\
72 - Don't tell me.
Don't tell me.\\
73 - The die is cast.\\
74 - That's what I said.\\
75 - Oh, fine.\\
76 - Now, tell me, Dorothea Dix\\
77 - if they are not speaking to each
other\\
78 - how did you get them to come here for
dinner?\\
79 - Neither one knows that the other one
is coming.\\
80 - Oh, that should be interesting.\\
81 - Yoo-hoo.\\
82 - There's one of the lovebirds now.\\
83 - Yeah, before the evening is over\\
84 - there'll be feathers flying all over
the place.\\
85 - Oh, now, stop.\\
86 - Hi, Lucy.\\
87 - Hi, Ethel.\\
88 - Hi, Ricky.
Hello, Ethel.\\
89 - Let me take your coat, honey.\\
90 - Thanks.
Here, I'll take it, dear.\\
91 - Gee, you look beautiful.\\
92 - It was nice of you to ask me to
dinner.\\
93 - I almost didn't make it.
I just got home.\\
94 - I've been so busy socially, you know\\
95 - dancing every night\\
96 - luncheons and teas every afternoon.\\
97 - Oh, really?\\
98 - Oh, yes.\\
99 - I've been having a wonderful time.\\
100 - Oh, bread.\\
101 - I haven't eaten since he left.\\
102 - Oh, really?\\
103 - Gee, you sure must miss him.\\
104 - I do not.\\
105 - He didn't leave me any money, the big
fat slob.\\
106 - Well, we'll eat right away, dear.\\
107 - Good.\\
108 - Oh, four places, is someone else
coming?\\
109 - Well, I-I didn't tell you, Ethel\\
110 - but I've invited a fascinating man
for you.\\
111 - He's a real dream.\\
112 - Oh, Lucy, you shouldn't have done
that.\\
113 - After all, I'm still a married woman.\\
114 - What's he like?\\
115 - I'm not going to tell you.\\
116 - I want you to be surprised.\\
117 - She will be.\\
118 - Oh, this is exciting.\\
119 - I better go powder my nose.\\
120 - He's a real dream, huh?\\
121 - Uh-huh.\\
122 - Can I put on some of your good
perfume?\\
123 - Sure.\\
124 - Well, you really cooked one up this
time.\\
125 - Now, don't worry.\\
126 - Everything's going to be all right.\\
127 - You know what'll happen?\\
128 - Yeah, they'll kill each other\\
129 - right in front of our eyes.\\
130 - They will not.\\
131 - That must be the other lovebird now.\\
132 - Hi, Rick.\\
133 - Hello, Fred.
How are you?\\
134 - Gee, I'm glad to see you.\\
135 - We sure miss you around here.\\
136 - How's everything down at the Y?\\
137 - Oh, fine, fine, thanks.\\
138 - Hi, Lucy.\\
139 - Hi, Fred.\\
140 - I brought you something.\\
141 - Oh, thank you.\\
142 - You're welcome.\\
143 - I was going to call up and say hello\\
144 - but I've really been having a time.\\
145 - Really?
Yeah.\\
146 - You really been living it up, eh?\\
147 - Have I? Rick, I'm a free man again.\\
148 - You wouldn't believe the things I
been doing.\\
149 - What have you been doing?\\
150 - Everything I did before I was
married.\\
151 - No kidding?\\
152 - Yeah, handball, basketball,
badminton, squash...\\
153 - I'm pooped.\\
154 - Gee, when do we eat?\\
155 - I-I've been living on peanut butter
sandwiches.\\
156 - Oh, are you expecting somebody else?\\
157 - Well, um, yes, Fred.\\
158 - I-I-I took the liberty\\
159 - of inviting a nice young lady\\
160 - to be your dinner companion.\\
161 - A young lady?\\
162 - Yeah, a cute young chick.\\
163 - Oh.\\
164 - Well, bring her on.\\
165 - Ho, ho, ho.\\
166 - A young chick, huh?\\
167 - Am I ready.\\
168 - Yoo-hoo, he's here.\\
169 - Come on out now.\\
170 - What are you doing here?\\
171 - What are you doing here?\\
172 - Lucy, is that my date?\\
173 - He's no dream; he's a nightmare.\\
174 - Is that your idea of a cute young
chick?\\
175 - You'll never shop for my poultry.\\
176 - Aw, now come on.\\
177 - As long as we're all here\\
178 - why don't we sit down and eat?\\
179 - Yeah, come on, Ethel.\\
180 - No, thanks, I just lost my appetite.\\
181 - Me too.
I'm leaving.\\
182 - Where's my coat?\\
183 - Where's my coat?\\
184 - Well, all right, Ricky, get their
coats.\\
185 - Okay.\\
186 - Here you are, Fred.\\
187 - Well, thanks.\\
188 - Here you are, Ethel.\\
189 - Thank you.\\
190 - Well, as long as she's leaving\\
191 - I guess I could stay and help you eat
that food.\\
192 - You're not letting him stay\\
193 - and do you out of this beautiful
roast beef\\
194 - are you, Ethel?\\
195 - Um, no, why should I?\\
196 - Good. Let's everybody sit down.\\
197 - That a girl.
Give me that coat.\\
198 - Yeah, Fred, you sit over here by me.\\
199 - Well, thanks.\\
200 - Uh, you two don't mind sharing the
piano bench, do you?\\
201 - Now, let's see here.\\
202 - How's that, Ethel?\\
203 - Not too much fat is there?\\
204 - There certainly is.\\
205 - He means the meat.\\
206 - Oh, oh, no, the meat looks fine.\\
207 - Oh, thanks.
Here you are, Ethel.\\
208 - Thank you.\\
209 - Here you are, Fred.\\
210 - Thank you.\\
211 - Ah, potatoes.\\
212 - Nice and hot too.\\
213 - And beans.\\
214 - No potatoes, Ricky?\\
215 - No, I'm strictly a meat man.\\
216 - What about you, Fred?\\
217 - Thank you, Lucy.
Thank you.\\
218 - Okay, string beans?\\
219 - If it weren't for you\\
220 - I wouldn't get anything to eat.\\
221 - Oh, here you are, Ethel.\\
222 - Thank you.\\
223 - Want some gravy, Ricky?\\
224 - Yeah, a little bit, please.\\
225 - Oh, on your meat?\\
226 - Yeah, right on the meat.\\
227 - I love gravy.
That's it.\\
228 - I love gravy.\\
229 - Yeah?\\
230 - Yes, I love gravy.\\
231 - There, Lucy.\\
232 - Thank you.\\
233 - You're welcome.\\
234 - There, now has everybody got
everything?\\
235 - Yep.
Yeah.\\
236 - So...\\
237 - This sure looks good.\\
238 - I've never been so hungry.\\
239 - Oh!\\
240 - Oh!\\
241 - Oh!\\
242 - Ethel, what happened?\\
243 - He pushed me off the bench, that's
what happened.\\
244 - I did not. She fell off.\\
245 - Oh, that does it.\\
246 - Roast beef or no roast beef, I'm
leaving.\\
247 - Don't bother, I'll go.\\
248 - Oh, you don't have to go...\\
249 - Ethel, Ethel, please.\\
250 - Ricky, I guess this was a bad idea of
mine.\\
251 - Let's get their coats.\\
252 - All right.\\
253 - Here you are, Fred.\\
254 - Thanks.\\
255 - Here you are, Ethel.\\
256 - Thanks.\\
257 - Oh, oh!\\
258 - Why you...\\
259 - What's going on here?\\
260 - Lucy, let me out of here.\\
261 - Untie this coat.\\
262 - Not until you kiss and make up.\\
263 - I'll never speak to him again\\
264 - after the things he said to me.\\
265 - What about the things you said to me?\\
266 - She said my mother looks like a
weasel.\\
267 - Apologize, Ethel.\\
268 - No.\\
269 - Oh, come on, Ethel.\\
270 - Tell him you're sorry.\\
271 - Well, I'm sorry\\
272 - your mother looks like a weasel.\\
273 - Now, Ethel...\\
274 - Well, he should have more
consideration.\\
275 - After all, I gave him the best years
of my life.\\
276 - Were those the best?\\
277 - All right, all right, now you're
even.\\
278 - Now, what are your terms for making
up, Ethel?\\
279 - Well, let him apologize.\\
280 - He started it.\\
281 - I did not.\\
282 - You did too.\\
283 - I did not! I never...\\
284 - All right! All right. It doesn't
matter who started it.\\
285 - What matters is how it got started.\\
286 - What was it all about?\\
287 - Well...\\
288 - Uh...\\
289 - I was, uh, uh...\\
290 - He said, uh...\\
291 - I forget.\\
292 - So do I.\\
293 - You see, you can't even remember.\\
294 - Well, it wasn't how it started.\\
295 - It was the things we said afterward.\\
296 - I'm sorry, Fred.\\
297 - I apologize, honey bun.\\
298 - Sweetie pie.\\
299 - Baby doll.\\
300 - Sugar lips.\\
301 - You know, this is pretty sickening.\\
302 - I liked them better when they were
mad.\\
303 - Let's get back to the dinner.\\
304 - Now we can eat.\\
305 - Dinner is getting cold.\\
306 - Doesn't that food look great?\\
307 - Aren't quarrels silly?\\
308 - They sure are, honey.\\
309 - When's the last time we had a fight,
Ricky?\\
310 - Gosh, I don't remember, dear.\\
311 - Neither do I.\\
312 - See, why don't you two be like us?\\
313 - That's a good idea.\\
314 - I'll dye my hair red\\
315 - and Fred can speak with an accent.\\
316 - Well, if I remember correctly\\
317 - you two had your spats.\\
318 - Well...\\
319 - Ricky only got to go to the fights\\
320 - with me last month\\
321 - because you weren't speaking to each
other.\\
322 - Oh, yeah.\\
323 - But it didn't last long.\\
324 - No, I gave in and put an end to it.\\
325 - Yeah, you want some more gravy,
Ethel?\\
326 - What'd you say, Ricky?\\
327 - You put an end to it?\\
328 - I was the one who gave in.\\
329 - Oh, pardon me, honey, but, uh\\
330 - I was the one that called the whole
thing off, remember?\\
331 - You? I went all the way down to your
club to apologize--\\
332 - remember?\\
333 - Well, honey, that was after--\\
334 - you went down all the way to the club
and apologized--\\
335 - after I sent you a dozen roses\\
336 - with a card saying that I was wrong,
remember?\\
337 - Before, darling.\\
338 - After, baby.\\
339 - Before, dear.\\
340 - After, sweetheart.\\
341 - Before.\\
342 - After.\\
343 - Before.\\
344 - It's your serve.\\
345 - After!\\
346 - I remember how tough it was\\
347 - to-to-to-to write that card\\
348 - saying that I was wrong when I was
right.\\
349 - Oh, you thought that you were right?\\
350 - I certainly did, and I still do.\\
351 - Well, it's good to know\\
352 - that I'm married to a hypocrite.\\
353 - Hypocrite?\\
354 - What's a hypocrite?\\
355 - A person who says one thing\\
356 - and means another.\\
357 - Thanks.\\
358 - Oh, yeah?\\
359 - Yeah.\\
360 - Oh, now, Ricky take it easy.\\
361 - She can't talk to me that way.\\
362 - But she's excited.\\
363 - That's no excuse.\\
364 - That's plenty 'scuse.\\
365 - And don't you make fun of my English.\\
366 - Hmm, that's English.\\
367 - Si, es ingles, yo hablo muy bien, muy
perfectamente.\\
368 - Usted no me tiene\\
369 - que decir que no hablo bien.\\
370 - How dare you say that to me.\\
371 - What did I say?\\
372 - I don't know, but how dare you!\\
373 - I'll show you who gives in first in
this family.\\
374 - Mira que me decia a mi que yo no se
hablar ingles\\
375 - cuando lo he estudiado perfectamente\\
376 - en todas las universidades muchisimos
anos.\\
377 - Yo hablo mejor que toda\\
378 - la gente que esta sentada en la mesa
aqui.\\
379 - And whenever you're ready to call me
and apologize\\
380 - you can call me down at the club!\\
381 - Don't hold your breath!\\
382 - Ha!\\
383 - Fred, Fred, we'd better go.\\
384 - Yes, yes...\\
385 - No, no, no, don't go.\\
386 - We'll just finish our dinner.\\
387 - Certainly not going to let him\\
388 - spoil a dinner for us.\\
389 - This meat is cooked just the way I
like it\\
390 - nice and juicy.\\
391 - Yoo-hoo.\\
392 - Lucy, where are you?\\
393 - I'm in the bedroom.\\
394 - Good morning.\\
395 - Morning.\\
396 - Oh...\\
397 - You've been crying.\\
398 - I have not.\\
399 - A rabbit should have such pink eyes.\\
400 - I'm getting a cold.\\
401 - Oh.\\
402 - I gather Ricky didn't come home last
night.\\
403 - You mean that funny-looking Cuban\\
404 - that used to hang around here?\\
405 - Yeah, that's the guy I had reference
to.\\
406 - No, he didn't come home last night\\
407 - and he didn't call this morning.\\
408 - Not that it makes any difference to
me.\\
409 - Oh, I can see it doesn't matter to
old indifferent you\\
410 - Why don't call him up\\
411 - and tell him you're sorry?\\
412 - What? Swallow my pride?\\
413 - Call him up and go crawling back to
him?\\
414 - Hah!\\
415 - Well...\\
416 - Besides, the line was busy.\\
417 - I thought so.\\
418 - Call him up again.\\
419 - I will not.\\
420 - Why not?\\
421 - I called him once; now it's his turn.\\
422 - What if he never calls you?\\
423 - Then we'll just never see each other
again.\\
424 - Oh, we can't have that.\\
425 - Now, let's see.\\
426 - I could invite you both to dinner\\
427 - without telling the other\\
428 - but that's been done a lot lately.\\
429 - Yeah, that's a pretty stale bit.\\
430 - I know, we'll use the old sympathy
routine.\\
431 - Sympathy routine?\\
432 - Yeah. You know how families are--\\
433 - no matter what differences they've
had\\
434 - they always unite in cases of
sickness, accident\\
435 - and terrible tragedy.\\
436 - What are you talking about?\\
437 - I'll call up Ricky and tell him
you've been run over by a bus.\\
438 - Run over by a bus?\\
439 - Yeah.\\
440 - Well, that seems rather drastic.\\
441 - Oh, we'll only pretend.\\
442 - Oh.\\
443 - I'll wrap you all up in bandages\\
444 - and then I'll call him up\\
445 - and tell him you've had a terrible
accident.\\
446 - That'll bring him back.\\
447 - Well, it might work.\\
448 - It can't miss.\\
449 - Have you got plenty of adhesive tape\\
450 - and bandages in the house?\\
451 - Well, that all depends.\\
452 - On what?\\
453 - On what kind of a bus I get hit by,
local or express.\\
454 - You like the peanut butter sandwiches\\
455 - they serve here, Rick?\\
456 - Kind of stick\\
457 - to the roof of your mouth, don't
they?\\
458 - Yeah.\\
459 - Oh, just give me a small grape juice.\\
460 - It's none of my business, Rick, but
this is silly.\\
461 - Why don't you break down and call
Lucy?\\
462 - What? And give her the satisfaction\\
463 - of knowing that I gave in first?\\
464 - Well, I was just thinking.\\
465 - Besides, the line was busy.\\
466 - Well, what do you want to do?\\
467 - Go through life with a sticky upper
plate?\\
468 - There are other places to eat\\
469 - besides this drugstore, you know.\\
470 - You know what I mean.\\
471 - I know all about this business.\\
472 - Why don't you swallow your pride?\\
473 - I'm having enough trouble with this
sandwich.\\
474 - If only we could think\\
475 - of a way to bring you two together\\
476 - without making you make up first.\\
477 - Let's give this a good think.\\
478 - Yeah.\\
479 - We're very noisy thinkers.\\
480 - If only the apartment would catch on
fire\\
481 - and you could rush in and save Lucy.\\
482 - What'd she put in there?\\
483 - No, I saw it last week on television.\\
484 - This girl couldn't stand this guy\\
485 - until he saved her life in a fire.\\
486 - Then she was so grateful, she married
him.\\
487 - Well, thanks, Fred, that's a swell
idea\\
488 - but I hardly think\\
489 - that I will set your apartment
building on fire.\\
490 - Of course, that's it.\\
491 - You must be daffy or heavily insured.\\
492 - Oh, you don't understand.\\
493 - We just pretend to set the apartment
on fire.\\
494 - How do you pretend to have a fire?\\
495 - It's easy.\\
496 - That strap tight enough, Lucy?\\
497 - I guess so.\\
498 - How about this?
A little tighter.\\
499 - How's that?
Okay.\\
500 - This comfortable?\\
501 - Yeah.\\
502 - Now, put your arm in this sling.\\
503 - Oh.\\
504 - There.\\
505 - Okay.\\
506 - That's great.
You look fine.\\
507 - I hope you got the number of the bus
that hit me.\\
508 - You know\\
509 - you look like you really were hit.\\
510 - And dragged nine blocks.\\
511 - Come on, now, get in bed.\\
512 - Oh, here, I'll help you.\\
513 - Get your legs up.\\
514 - Want another pillow?\\
515 - Yeah.\\
516 - Oh.\\
517 - How's that?\\
518 - Okay. Ooh...
I got an itch.\\
519 - Where?
Right under my arm.\\
520 - Right back there.\\
521 - Right there, to the right, to the
right.\\
522 - Over, over, up.
Over?\\
523 - Ah! Oh!\\
524 - Thanks.\\
525 - I got to go before Ricky gets home.\\
526 - Are you sure he's coming, Ethel?\\
527 - I called the club, and they said he
was out\\
528 - but they'd give him the message.\\
529 - Well, I hope he hurries.\\
530 - Are you okay?\\
531 - Okay? I've been in a terrible
accident.\\
532 - Good luck.\\
533 - She must be in the bedroom.\\
534 - Pull that couch out of there.\\
535 - Okay.\\
536 - Hurry up.\\
537 - Hurry up.
That ought to do it.\\
538 - Hook up the fan.\\
539 - Okay.\\
540 - Here, here's the switch.\\
541 - Right in here.
I got it.\\
542 - Go ahead.\\
543 - Think this ought to do it?\\
544 - Yeah, looks like it.\\
545 - Help, fire, the building's on fire.\\
546 - Run for your lives!\\
547 - Hey, what's going on here?\\
548 - What's going on here?\\
549 - Ricky, I'm glad you're here.\\
550 - Lucy's trapped in the bedroom.\\
551 - Well, I'm going to go in there and
save her.\\
552 - No, no, the whole place is a solid
wall of flames.\\
553 - I'm going in there no matter what you
say.\\
554 - Hold him, men, hold him.\\
555 - Let me go, let me go.\\
556 - I'm going in there and save my wife.\\
557 - Stand back.\\
558 - You'll be burned to a cinder.\\
559 - I'm going in there, men, let me go.\\
560 - I'm going in there no matter what
happens.\\
561 - Careful, everybody\\
562 - the whole building is beginning to
crumble.\\
563 - I'm going in no matter what happens
to me.\\
564 - Let me go, let me go, let me go,
fellows.\\
565 - Don't hold me back.\\
566 - Do you think it's time to go in?\\
567 - Yeah.
All right.\\
568 - I'm going in there.
Lucy, don't worry.\\
569 - I'm coming in to save you.\\
570 - Right now. Here we go.\\
571 - Where are you, Lucy?\\
572 - Where are you?
Are you in there?\\
573 - She's not here.\\
574 - She's not in there.\\
575 - Well, how do you like that.\\
576 - We went through all that trouble\\
577 - and she wasn't even here.\\
578 - Gee, honey, now are you sure\\
579 - those bandages are fake?\\
580 - Uh, yeah, honey.\\
581 - Are you sure you're all right?\\
582 - I'm fine.\\
583 - Here, honey, let me help you.\\
584 - It's a good thing\\
585 - the Mertzes had their awning up.\\
586 - Aw, honey, it was all my fault.\\
587 - No, it was my fault, honey.\\
588 - Weren't we silly?\\
589 - Yeah, we'll never argue again.\\
590 - No, baby.\\
591 - Are you okay, Lucy?\\
592 - Yeah, Fred, I'm fine.\\
593 - Sure?\\
594 - Sure.\\
595 - Oh, thank heavens you're all right.\\
596 - Why? What's the matter?\\
597 - Well, when I told Ethel the whole gag
was my idea\\
598 - she got mad and went home to her
mother.\\
599 - Oh!

\subsection {Episode 23: The Moustache (1952)}
1 - Hurry up, dear.\\
2 - The Mertzes will be here any minute.\\
3 - I'll be ready, honey.\\
4 - I was just shaving\\
5 - so I look real nice when I go out
with my wife.\\
6 - Well, isn't that sweet?\\
7 - I thought you said you shaved.\\
8 - I did.\\
9 - What's the matter with your upper
lip?\\
10 - Is it out of bounds?\\
11 - You mean my moustache?\\
12 - Your what?\\
13 - My moustache.\\
14 - Ricky, it's true.\\
15 - Your upper lip has whiskers on it.\\
16 - What do expect, feathers?\\
17 - No, I expect you to go in there and
shave it off.\\
18 - You know I don't like a moustache on
you.\\
19 - Why not?\\
20 - Because it looks like an eyebrow\\
21 - and your mouth keeps staring at me.\\
22 - Well, I guess it could use a little
eyebrow pencil\\
23 - until it gets stronger.\\
24 - Listen, now, we're going to have this
out right now.\\
25 - You're going in there and shave that
off?\\
26 - No.\\
27 - Come here.\\
28 - Oh, darn it.\\
29 - It's still there.\\
30 - I thought maybe I could singe it off.\\
31 - Oh, honey, you'll love my moustache\\
32 - once you get used to it.\\
33 - I will not.\\
34 - Well, honey, just wait till it gets a
little strunger.\\
35 - It's never get "strunger."\\
36 - You've tried this before, Ricky.\\
37 - You know you always end up\\
38 - looking like a little boy who drank
chocolate milk.\\
39 - Well, you never let me give it a
chance.\\
40 - This time, I'm going to cultivate it.\\
41 - What are you going to use on it--
Vigoro?\\
42 - Never mind that.\\
43 - I look wonderful in a moustache.\\
44 - You just look silly in a moustache,
Ricky.\\
45 - I do not.\\
46 - Here are the Mertzes.\\
47 - Let's see what they think.\\
48 - All right, we'll see.\\
49 - Well, we'll just see.\\
50 - Just don't put any words in their
mouth.\\
51 - Don't worry, I won't have to.\\
52 - Okay.\\
53 - Hi, folks.\\
54 - Hi, Lucy.
Hi, Lucy.\\
55 - Hi, Ricky.
Hiya.\\
56 - Hi.
Are you ready to go to the movies?\\
57 - You are just in time to settle
something.\\
58 - We are?
Yeah?\\
59 - Yes. As two impartial observers\\
60 - we'd like your opinion on something.
Yeah.\\
61 - Well, I'll be happy to g...\\
62 - Ricky, you're growing a moustache.\\
63 - Gee, it looks wonderful.\\
64 - Well, let me see.\\
65 - Hey, that looks great.\\
66 - Now, what did you want our opinion
on?\\
67 - Nothing, Benedict Ethel.\\
68 - Well, Ricky and I just had a big, fat
argument\\
69 - about how ridiculous he looks in that
moustache\\
70 - and then you had to come in and louse
up everything.\\
71 - Well, I think he looks handsome.\\
72 - I do too.\\
73 - So do I.\\
74 - Brother.\\
75 - Besides, I have a very good reason\\
76 - for growing this moustache.\\
77 - What is it?\\
78 - He wants a divorce.\\
79 - You'll change your tune when you see
me as the star\\
80 - of the new Technicolor motion picture
Moon over Baghdad.\\
81 - Ricky! You didn't tell me\\
82 - you were going to star in a moving
picture.\\
83 - Well, I was keeping it...\\
84 - spring it on you as a surprise, you
know?\\
85 - You know when you're leaving for
Hollywood?\\
86 - Well, not exactly.\\
87 - Have you signed your contract yet?\\
88 - Well, not exactly.\\
89 - But they've agreed to star you.\\
90 - Well, not exactly.\\
91 - Well, what exactly?\\
92 - Well, a talent scout from Hollywood\\
93 - is coming to town to look\\
94 - for someone to star in the picture\\
95 - and my agent has a friend\\
96 - whose brother-in-law knows the talent
scout's wife.\\
97 - Well, what are we waiting for?\\
98 - Let's pack.\\
99 - Star you in a picture.\\
100 - Well, don't you worry.\\
101 - I'll get an appointment to see him.\\
102 - Yeah, you'll get an appointment\\
103 - if the agent's friend's
brother-in-law\\
104 - is still speaking to this talent
scout's wife.\\
105 - Gee, a real, live talent scout from
Hollywood.\\
106 - Hey, Rick-- ask him if he can use a
song-and-dance man.\\
107 - And don't forget about me.\\
108 - I used to do an oriental dance.\\
109 - La-dee-da-da, da-da-da, da, da-da-da\\
110 - I was known as "The Queen of the
Nile."\\
111 - Oh!\\
112 - She's a little rusty around Cairo.\\
113 - Oh, you!\\
114 - All right, come on, are we going\\
115 - to go to the movies or not?\\
116 - I'm not leaving here\\
117 - till you shave off that silly
moustache.\\
118 - Honey... baby doll...\\
119 - I'm not going to shave it off\\
120 - so why don't you just relax and enjoy
it?\\
121 - I mean it, Ricky.
I'm not leaving here.\\
122 - Now, Lucy.\\
123 - No!\\
124 - All right.\\
125 - We'll go without her.\\
126 - Come on.\\
127 - You two go ahead.\\
128 - I'll stay here with Lucy.\\
129 - All right. Good-bye, Ethel.\\
130 - Come on, Fred.
Bring me a bag of popcorn\\
131 - Okay.
with lots of butter.\\
132 - Yeah, yeah.\\
133 - Got 20 cents, Rick?\\
134 - Come on.\\
135 - Darn that Ricky.\\
136 - I'll get rid of his cookie-duster
somehow.\\
137 - You know, my grandfather used to have
a moustache--\\
138 - a great, big, long handlebar one--\\
139 - and Grandma got rid of it in the
middle of the night.\\
140 - How?\\
141 - She tied it around a bedpost\\
142 - when he was asleep and then yelled
"fire."\\
143 - Oh!\\
144 - Oh, Ethel!\\
145 - Hey, that gives me an idea though.\\
146 - It does?\\
147 - Yeah. Ricky's not going\\
148 - to be the only one in this family\\
149 - with a moustache.\\
150 - What?\\
151 - I'm going to glue on a false one\\
152 - and I'm not going to take it off\\
153 - till he shaves off his.\\
154 - Lucy, congratulations.\\
155 - What for?\\
156 - You've finally topped yourself.\\
157 - This is the craziest idea you've had
yet.\\
158 - Lucy!\\
159 - Where are you?\\
160 - I'm in here.\\
161 - Where have you two been?\\
162 - Ricky will be home any minute.\\
163 - We had a hard time finding it.\\
164 - It was down at the bottom\\
165 - of my vaudeville trunk.\\
166 - Well, give it here.
Let's see now.\\
167 - I'll have to cut off the beard.\\
168 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
169 - You can't cut that, Lucy.\\
170 - Those things are expensive.\\
171 - Well, I can't wear the whole thing.\\
172 - Why not?\\
173 - Yeah, why not?\\
174 - Yeah, why not?\\
175 - Uncle Sam wants you.\\
176 - Show me how to stick it on, Fred.\\
177 - All right.\\
178 - This is spirit gum.\\
179 - Look, I just put a little\\
180 - on your upper lip here.\\
181 - Oh, that smells awful.\\
182 - Lucy, I'm home.\\
183 - Be right there.\\
184 - Hi, dear.\\
185 - Hi, honey.\\
186 - How's about giving me a nice big
kiss?\\
187 - There's nothing I...\\
188 - What's the matter?\\
189 - I thought you were going to kiss me.\\
190 - Lucy, where did you get that thin'?\\
191 - What "thin"?\\
192 - Those whiskers.\\
193 - What whiskers?\\
194 - These.\\
195 - Oh, these.\\
196 - Oh, my five-o'clock shadow?\\
197 - Guess I didn't give myself\\
198 - a very close shave this morning.\\
199 - All right, Lucy.\\
200 - What are you up to?\\
201 - Nothing, nothing.\\
202 - I'm just growing this so that I can
get a part\\
203 - in that Technicolor movie called Moon
Over the North Pole.\\
204 - I'm going to play Santa Claus.\\
205 - Okay, okay, joke's over.\\
206 - Now, take that ridiculous thing off
your face.\\
207 - It makes you look like a freak.\\
208 - Oh, you think it looks funny, huh?\\
209 - I certainly do.\\
210 - Well, now you know how your moustache
looks to me.\\
211 - Oh, so that's it, huh?\\
212 - Well, your little gag didn't work.\\
213 - So just take it off.\\
214 - Nothing doing.\\
215 - I'm not taking it off till you shave
off yours.\\
216 - Well, I'm not shaving.\\
217 - Neither am I.\\
218 - Of course, we'll have to change our
name to the Smith Brothers.\\
219 - And we could always get\\
220 - moustache cups marked his and hers.\\
221 - Now, Lucy, you listen to me.\\
222 - Now, I'm not going to stand here
and...\\
223 - I can't stand it.\\
224 - You win.\\
225 - Take it off and I'll shave.\\
226 - Good!\\
227 - Shave right now.\\
228 - I got it all set up for you.\\
229 - There you are.\\
230 - All right, all right.\\
231 - You've got more eyebrow pencil on
there\\
232 - than you have whiskers.\\
233 - Never mind the cracks.\\
234 - Get it off, now.\\
235 - You missed one right there.\\
236 - What do you call this one-- Charlie?\\
237 - There!\\
238 - Now you look like your old self
again.\\
239 - Welcome back, little lip.\\
240 - Give me a great big kiss.\\
241 - I'm not going to kiss you with that
thing on.\\
242 - Oh, I forgot.\\
243 - Gee, this must have been put on\\
244 - with pretty strong stuff.\\
245 - Here, let me try, honey.\\
246 - Ow!\\
247 - Gosh.\\
248 - Boy, that's really stuck.\\
249 - Are you sure you didn't grow this?\\
250 - I better call Fred\\
251 - and find out how to get this off.\\
252 - Hello?\\
253 - Fred, this is Lucy.\\
254 - Oh, hi, did the joke come off all
right?\\
255 - Yeah, the joke did, but the beard
didn't.\\
256 - Well, what do you mean?\\
257 - Well, I've tugged and I've pulled and
I can't get it off.\\
258 - Well, that's funny.\\
259 - It should come off easy.\\
260 - I just used a little spirit gum.\\
261 - Ricky, get me that bottle off the
dresser, will you, dear?\\
262 - All right, Hon.\\
263 - Fred, y-you shouldn't have used\\
264 - such old stuff.\\
265 - Maybe it changes with age.\\
266 - How long have you had it?\\
267 - Well, now, let's see, the last date I
played\\
268 - was a split week in Peoria in 1925.\\
269 - '25?!\\
270 - But spirit gum shouldn't change.\\
271 - Oh.\\
272 - Here, honey, I've got the bottle.\\
273 - Thanks, dear.\\
274 - I have the bottle right here, Fred.\\
275 - It says "bull dog cement"!\\
276 - Cement?\\
277 - Yeah. "Bull dog cement will not let
go, holds fast forever.\\
278 - "Can only be removed\\
279 - with bull dog cement remover number
three."\\
280 - Oh, no.\\
281 - Oh, yes!\\
282 - Oh, shut up.\\
283 - You certainly have a warped sense of
humor.\\
284 - I'm sorry, honey, I'll ca...\\
285 - I'll call the...\\
286 - I'll call the drug store and see if
they got some of that stuff.\\
287 - They won't have it in a drug store.\\
288 - They have everything in a drug store.\\
289 - Hello.\\
290 - Listen, have you ever heard of some
stuff\\
291 - called bull dog cement remover number
three?\\
292 - You have?\\
293 - Oh, I see.\\
294 - Well, thanks.\\
295 - They don't make it anymore.\\
296 - You mean... you mean I'll have to
keep this on forever?\\
297 - Well, honey, I guess it'll wear off
eventually.\\
298 - Well, what happens in the meantime?\\
299 - Well, honey\\
300 - I really should let you suffer\\
301 - but I don't have the heart to do it.\\
302 - There's one simple solution\\
303 - and I'll do it for you.\\
304 - What?\\
305 - I'll get you job as the bearded lady
in the circus.\\
306 - Oh.\\
307 - Lucy?\\
308 - Lucy?\\
309 - Where are you?\\
310 - Lucy, I wanted to ask...\\
311 - Oh, I beg your pardon.\\
312 - I was looking for...\\
313 - Good afternoon, ma'am.\\
314 - Lucy?\\
315 - Colonel Ricardo, at your beck and
call, you all.\\
316 - Lucy, what are you doing in those
clothes?\\
317 - Well, it's the only way I can get
down\\
318 - to that little old drugstore\\
319 - without people laughing\\
320 - at little old me.\\
321 - I thought maybe that little old
druggist\\
322 - could do something\\
323 - for this little old face.\\
324 - Well, how did you all do, Colonel?\\
325 - Bad, powerful bad.\\
326 - Oh, you poor little old thing.\\
327 - Didn't he have any ideas?\\
328 - Yeah, he said dye the beard red\\
329 - and the head would match all over.\\
330 - Oh, what'll I do?\\
331 - What's the matter?\\
332 - When you chew with that beard on you
look just like a billy goat.\\
333 - Nobody but a nanny goat would notice
it.\\
334 - Well!\\
335 - I've got it.\\
336 - What?\\
337 - Nah, you wouldn't go for it.\\
338 - What is it?\\
339 - Well...\\
340 - Nah, you wouldn't like it.\\
341 - Well, give me a chance.\\
342 - What is it?\\
343 - Well, we'll tie a string to your
beard.\\
344 - Yeah.\\
345 - Then we'll tie the other end of the
string to a flat iron.\\
346 - Yeah?
Then I'll throw...\\
347 - No! Don't throw it.\\
348 - Oh!\\
349 - I knew you wouldn't like it.\\
350 - Look out!\\
351 - Scared me to death.\\
352 - I think this is safer for little old
me.\\
353 - Lucy...\\
354 - What?\\
355 - You just gave me an idea.\\
356 - What is it?\\
357 - Well... we'll set fire to your beard\\
358 - but I'll stand by with a hose\\
359 - to see that it doesn't get out of
hand.\\
360 - Ethel, this is my face.\\
361 - You're not burning weeds off a vacant
lot.\\
362 - Who is it?\\
363 - It's Fred.\\
364 - What do you want?\\
365 - If I bring good news, can I come in?\\
366 - All right.\\
367 - What is it?\\
368 - I must have made a thousand phone
calls\\
369 - before I located a drugstore that
sells\\
370 - bull dog cement remover number three.\\
371 - Oh, Fred, you doll.\\
372 - Where is it?\\
373 - It's in Chicago.\\
374 - Chicago?\\
375 - Yeah, but he's sending it Air Mail\\
376 - so it ought to be here tomorrow.\\
377 - Oh...\\
378 - Now, Lucy, that's not bad.
No.\\
379 - Oh... Chicago.\\
380 - Hello.\\
381 - Hello, is Monty Woolley there?\\
382 - Did you call me up just to make gags?\\
383 - No, this is important.\\
384 - You know that talent scout I was
talking to you about?\\
385 - Yeah?\\
386 - Well, I talked to him today\\
387 - and I talked him into coming to the
house\\
388 - to spend an evening with us.\\
389 - Oh, Ricky, that's wonderful.\\
390 - Right in our own home.\\
391 - When is he coming?\\
392 - Tonight.\\
393 - Oh, that...
oh, no, not tonight, Ricky.\\
394 - Please, not tonight.\\
395 - Well, honey, he's flying back to
Hollywood tomorrow.\\
396 - If I don't get him up to the house
tonight\\
397 - I'll never get a chance to see him
alone.\\
398 - But, Ricky, what about me?\\
399 - It's my one chance to get into the
movies, too.\\
400 - My beard, remember? My beard!\\
401 - Well, I'm sorry, honey, there's
nothing I can do about it.\\
402 - Oh.\\
403 - We'll be home about 7:30.
Good-bye.\\
404 - Good-bye.\\
405 - Oh, Ricky's bringing\\
406 - that Hollywood talent scout to the
house tonight.\\
407 - He is?\\
408 - No kidding?\\
409 - Uh... Lucy, would you mind if we
dropped in?\\
410 - No, of course not.\\
411 - Well, we got to go.\\
412 - Yeah, see you later!\\
413 - Here we are, Mr. Murdoch.\\
414 - Ah.\\
415 - Let me take your coat.\\
416 - Oh, thank you.\\
417 - Make yourself at home, will you?\\
418 - Fine. Well, nice place you have here,
Ricardo.\\
419 - Thank you.\\
420 - Sit down.\\
421 - Thanks.\\
422 - Boy, I'll be glad\\
423 - when that picture, Moon over Baghdad\\
424 - is finished with the casting.\\
425 - Ah... have a cigarette, won't you?\\
426 - Oh, thank you.\\
427 - You know, it's nice to spend an
evening someplace else\\
428 - besides a hotel room or a theater.\\
429 - Yes, well, that's what I thought.\\
430 - That's why I asked you to come over
here\\
431 - and get a night off from show
business.\\
432 - Ah, that's sounds good.\\
433 - Oh!\\
434 - I wonder how that got here.\\
435 - What's that?\\
436 - That's my old scrapbook.\\
437 - My wife must have been doing\\
438 - some housecleaning.\\
439 - I haven't seen this for years.\\
440 - Well, let's see it.\\
441 - Oh, no, no. This is your night off.\\
442 - I wouldn't want to bother you with
this.\\
443 - All right.\\
444 - This is the first part\\
445 - that I had in New York--\\
446 - Broadway play, Too Many Girls.\\
447 - Oh, yeah, yeah.\\
448 - And, uh, over here's when I was at
the Copacabana.\\
449 - Oh, it's very interesting.\\
450 - Now, this...\\
451 - All right, all right, all right.\\
452 - That's enough.\\
453 - Mr. Murdoch\\
454 - this is our landlord and our
landlady.\\

comedy.\\

465 - Uh-uh.\\
466 - I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Murdoch.\\
467 - I must apologize for my friends.\\
468 - Oh, that's all right.\\
469 - Just please sit down and relax and
enjoy yourself.\\
470 - I'll put on\\
471 - a little music here for you.\\
472 - Fine, fine.\\
473 - Not so far from here\\
474 - There's a very lively atmosphere\\
475 - Everybody's going there this year\\

C-U-B-A.\\
492 - It's, um... very nice.\\
493 - Uh, Mr. Murdoch, you know\\
494 - we have a lot of other numbers.\\
495 - No, I... I...\\
496 - But I could convert some of them\\
497 - into the Arabian mood, you know.\\
498 - A little Arabian...\\
499 - What is this, a stranded Major Bowes
unit?\\
500 - Mr. Murdoch, I want you\\
501 - to meet my wife, Lucy.\\
502 - Lucy, this is Mr. Murdoch.\\
503 - How do you do?\\
504 - Well, I'll say one thing for you,
Mrs. Ricardo.\\
505 - You certainly dance very well.\\
506 - Oh, thank you.\\
507 - You know, we could use some dancing
girls\\
508 - in our new picture.\\
509 - Maybe we could use you.\\
510 - Oh, really?\\
511 - Yeah, I imagine so.\\
512 - Let me see your face.\\
513 - Oh.\\
514 - Oh, no, no, no.\\
515 - It's, uh, it's just a nose, a mouth,
a chin.\\
516 - You know, a complete set.\\
517 - Oh, come on, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
518 - Take off your veil.\\
519 - Well...\\
520 - Oh, yeah, come on, Lucy.\\
521 - Take it off.\\
522 - You keep out of this.\\
523 - Come on, Lucy.\\
524 - Ricky, stay away from me.\\
525 - Show him your face.\\
526 - Ricky...\\
527 - This is your big chance.\\
528 - You know, now I'm getting curious.\\
529 - I've got to see that face.\\
530 - Yeah.\\
531 - All right, all right.\\
532 - All right.\\
533 - It's time for the unveiling.\\
534 - Well, here's my nose.\\
535 - My mouth is just below it and it has
teeth\\
536 - and it goes sideways.\\
537 - All the way.\\
538 - Ricky!\\
539 - Hey, honey, look what just got
here.\\
540 - What?\\
541 - Special delivery letter from
Hollywood.\\
542 - What does it say?\\
543 - What does it say?\\
544 - Well, wait a minute, wait a minute.\\
545 - Well, what do you know?\\
546 - They want to test me for the lead.\\
547 - Oh, Ricky, how wonderful!\\
548 - Hey, wait a minute.\\
549 - They want to test you too.\\
550 - Where? Where? Where?\\
551 - "We think Mrs. Ricardo might be
perfect for..."\\
552 - I don't care what they pay me.\\
553 - I'm not going to play the part of
your father.\\
554 - The part of Mr. Murdoch was played by
John Brown.

\subsection {Episode 24: The Gossip (1952)}
1 - No!\\
2 - Really, Marge?\\
3 - Well, confidentially, I've suspected
that right along.\\
4 - I have, I have.\\
5 - You know what I've always thought\\
6 - about Betty and Jack.\\
7 - Yeah, well, I've always said\\
8 - if there was ever anything in the
world...\\
9 - Lucy, Lucy, for goodness sakes, get
off the phone.\\
10 - Pardon me, Marge.\\
11 - Did you say something. Ricky?\\
12 - Yes, I said, "Lucy, for goodness
sakes, get off the phone."\\
13 - Oh.\\
14 - Hello, Marge, bad connection.\\
15 - Where were we?\\
16 - Oh, yeah, Betty.\\
17 - Yeah, uh-huh...\\
18 - She didn't!\\
19 - She didn't!\\
20 - She didn't!\\
21 - She couldn't!\\
22 - Maybe that's why she didn't.\\
23 - Oh, keep quiet.\\
24 - No, not you, Marge.\\
25 - Well, honey, I never would have
thought that of Betty.\\
26 - Oh, good-bye, Marge.\\
27 - I'm surprised the phone hasn't grown
to your ear.\\
28 - Oh...\\
29 - Lucy, why did you stop?\\
30 - Don't tell me you got tired of taking
Betty apart?\\
31 - Who got tired?\\
32 - Marge had to hang up.\\
33 - Betty just walked in.\\
34 - Gee, I wonder what they're saying
about me.\\
35 - Lucy, I want to speak to you about
goss'ping.\\
36 - "Gossping"?\\
37 - Yes, I think that gossiping is
vicious and petty\\
38 - and I think a gossip is the lowest
form of human life.\\
39 - Oh, so do I.\\
40 - You don't seem to get my message.\\
41 - I was talking about you.\\
42 - Me gossip?\\
43 - What do you call what you were doing
on the phone?\\
44 - Well, it wasn't gossiping.\\
45 - I prefer to think of it\\
46 - as a mutual exchange of vital
information.\\
47 - Ay...\\
48 - Anyway, she was gossiping.\\
49 - I was just listening.\\
50 - Lucy, you remember the old saying\\
51 - "Birds of a feather smell the same"?\\
52 - You mean, "A rose by any other name
flocks together."\\
53 - Yeah.\\
54 - Well, anyway, I was just listening.\\
55 - It isn't gossip unless I tell it to
someone else.\\
56 - Well, that shouldn't take very long.\\
57 - Are you implying that I can't keep my
mouth shut?\\
58 - Yeah.\\
59 - Well, you'll find out.\\
60 - Nobody's going to get this
information from me.\\
61 - My lips are sealed.\\
62 - Uh, Fred and Ethel are coming up
tonight.\\
63 - I don't care, my lips are sealed.\\
64 - This I got to see.\\
65 - You will.\\
66 - Let them in, I'll be right back.\\
67 - All right.\\
68 - Hi, Ricky.\\
69 - Hi.\\
70 - I'm sorry we're late.\\
71 - I was fixing my hair.\\
72 - Hey, Rick, is your phone out of
order?\\
73 - I've been trying to get you for an
hour and a half.\\
74 - Yeah, well, I know.
Lucy's been on the phone\\
75 - for an hour and a half talking to
Marge.\\
76 - Oh.\\
77 - She's been getting all the details\\
78 - in some nice, juicy gossip.\\
79 - Really?\\
80 - Who was it?
When did it happen?
Who did what?\\
81 - Oh, come on, Ethel, reel in your
antenna.\\
82 - Quiet.\\
83 - Come on, Ricky, give out.\\
84 - Uh-uh.\\
85 - Well, Lucy will tell me.\\
86 - I don't know about that.\\
87 - She said she wouldn't say a word.\\
88 - She said her lips are sealed.\\
89 - Huh?\\
90 - Oh, boy, I'll say they're sealed.\\
91 - Hey, I kind of like that.\\
92 - How come you never went in for one of
those?\\
93 - Oh, shut up.\\
94 - Lucy, Ricky says you know\\
95 - a nice piece of juicy gossip.\\
96 - Well, tell me.\\
97 - Oh, darn it!\\
98 - This is liable to be real good, Fred.\\
99 - Would you care to join me in a
ringside seat.\\
100 - Thank you.\\
101 - Oh, this is maddening.\\
102 - Who's it about, Lucy?\\
103 - Madge?\\
104 - Uh... Blanche?\\
105 - Um...\\
106 - Dorothy?\\
107 - Um...\\
108 - Luanne?\\
109 - Uh, Betty?\\
110 - It's about Betty?\\
111 - Um...\\
112 - Uh, Betty and who?\\
113 - Betty and Fred?\\
114 - No...\\
115 - Betty and Ricky?\\
116 - Oh!\\
117 - Betty and her husband, Jack!\\
118 - Oh, Betty and her husband Jack, yeah!\\
119 - Um...\\
120 - what happened?\\
121 - They had a fight?\\
122 - What did they... what did they fight
about?\\
123 - A vase?\\
124 - A woman?\\
125 - Another woman?\\
126 - Betty and her husband, Jack, had a
fight\\
127 - about another woman? Oh...\\
128 - Lucy, you promised you wasn't
going\\
129 - to say anything to Ethel about it.\\
130 - You're breaking your promise.\\
131 - I don't care\\
132 - if you're not saying anything.\\
133 - You're still gossiping.\\
134 - Don't stop her now.\\
135 - I haven't found out what happened.\\
136 - How did Betty find out\\
137 - about Jack and the other woman?\\
138 - Who are you?\\
139 - A man?\\
140 - Her husband, Jack!\\
141 - Yeah, her husband, Jack...\\
142 - and Betty.\\
143 - No, no...\\
144 - the other woman!\\
145 - Jack and the other woman!\\
146 - Were out dancing?\\
147 - And drinking?\\
148 - And kissing?\\
149 - Oh!\\
150 - How'd Betty find out about it?\\
151 - Now, they were dancing...\\
152 - Yeah, Jack and the other woman are
dancing...\\
153 - and Betty came in the club...\\
154 - and saw them!\\
155 - So she separated them.\\
156 - Ooh!\\
157 - Oh!\\
158 - Oh!\\
159 - And Jack, Jack, yeah, yeah...\\
160 - tried to get them to stop fighting,
huh? Yeah...\\
161 - And they both beat up on him?\\
162 - Oh!\\
163 - Now they're all fighting...\\
164 - all three of them are fighting...\\
165 - and somebody came in.\\
166 - Uh, the manager?\\
167 - Uh, the bouncer?\\
168 - Oh!\\
169 - The doorman.\\
170 - Uh, uh, uh...\\
171 - a-a policeman!\\
172 - A policeman.\\
173 - He put the girls in the black Maria?\\
174 - Oh!\\
175 - Ooh, he threw in Jack!\\
176 - Oh, what a juicy piece of gossip.\\
177 - What a performance.\\
178 - Bravo!\\
179 - Bravo!\\
180 - Thank you, thank you.\\
181 - Isn't it amazing what women go
through\\
182 - to tell each other some dirt?\\
183 - Fantastic!\\
184 - Listen, so we gossip a little-- so do
men.\\
185 - Men gossip?\\
186 - Yes, men gossip.\\
187 - Well, now...\\
188 - Now, wait a minute, Fred.\\
189 - In all fairness, some men gossip a
little.\\
190 - Who does?\\
191 - Well, uh, take Marco, my piano
player, for instance.\\
192 - It was only yesterday\\
193 - that I caught him talking to the
drummer\\
194 - about Joe, the trombone player and
what a wolf he is.\\
195 - Joe, a wolf?\\
196 - Is he?\\
197 - I don't see how he can blow a note\\
198 - with those fangs of his.\\
199 - No kidding?\\
200 - Well, listen, this week is Nancy, the
harpist.\\
201 - Last week was one of the girls in the
trio.\\
202 - The week before that, it was the
hat-check girl.\\
203 - No!\\
204 - Yeah.\\
205 - Thank you, Hedda and Lolly.\\
206 - Now, wait a minute.\\
207 - The point is we can take it or leave
it alone.\\
208 - With you women, it's your life's
blood.\\
209 - Well, you two aren't exactly anemic.\\
210 - I'll bet you that we can keep from
gossiping\\
211 - longer than you men can.\\
212 - Oh, that's a hot one!\\
213 - Girls, you've made yourself a bet.\\
214 - Okay, what's the bet?\\
215 - Well, let's make it something
interesting, now.\\
216 - I know!\\
217 - The losers will serve the winners\\
218 - breakfast in bed for a month. How's
that?\\
219 - Okay, you've got yourself a deal.\\
220 - All right!\\
221 - Oh, hiya, Fred.\\
222 - Oh, hi, Rick.\\
223 - Wait a second, I'll walk home with
you.\\
224 - Ah, I'm glad I saw you.\\
225 - Just coffee.\\
226 - How are things in the gossip front?\\
227 - Well, this is the third day, isn't
it?\\
228 - Yeah, I haven't heard a peep of
gossip out of Lucy.\\
229 - Not a peep out of my biddy either.\\
230 - Thank you.\\
231 - You know, I have a plan\\
232 - but I think it's a little sneaky.\\
233 - Good, let's hear it.\\
234 - Well, I thought maybe we could cook
up\\
235 - some sensational hunk of gossip,
see...\\
236 - Uh-huh?\\
237 - And then we tell it to our wives\\
238 - and leave them alone and wait for
them to explode.\\
239 - Well, there will be an explosion, all
right\\
240 - except for one thing.\\
241 - What's that?\\
242 - If we tell them, then we'll be
gossiping.\\
243 - Oh, yeah, I didn't think of that.\\
244 - It was a nice try, though-- good try.\\
245 - Listen.\\
246 - Huh?\\
247 - Supposing that, accidentally, we
mumbled something in our sleep\\
248 - and our wives overheard it.\\
249 - We couldn't be accused\\
250 - of gossiping then, could we?\\
251 - Well, no...\\
252 - but what with...\\
253 - oh, you mean we-we pretend that we're
talking in our sleep?\\
254 - You got me.\\
255 - Ricky, you're a Cuban genius.\\
256 - Thank you.\\
257 - Now, let's see...\\
258 - who will we make up the story about?\\
259 - Well, what about...\\
260 - wait a minute, now.\\
261 - What about the Foster woman, the
blonde in 3-B?\\
262 - They're both jealous of her looks
anyway.\\
263 - Yeah, Grace Foster.\\
264 - Yeah.\\
265 - That's good, that's good.\\
266 - Grace Foster and who?\\
267 - The milkman.\\
268 - The milkman?\\
269 - Yes.\\
270 - That little, bitty guy?\\
271 - Yeah.\\
272 - He's so bashful.\\
273 - That makes it all the juicier.\\
274 - Grace Foster.\\
275 - Grace Foster.\\
276 - Grace Foster!\\
277 - Huh? What's the matter?\\
278 - What's the matter, Ricky?\\
279 - Oh, you must have had a nightmare.\\
280 - Sleep well, little husband.\\
281 - Grace Foster.\\
282 - Grace Foster?\\
283 - What about Grace Foster?\\
284 - What are you dreaming about?\\
285 - Why are you smiling like that?\\
286 - What about Grace Foster?\\
287 - Grace Foster is running away.\\
288 - Grace Foster is running away with...\\
289 - Don't stop now.\\
290 - Go on.\\
291 - Grace Foster is running away with the
milkman.\\
292 - The milkman?\\
293 - Uh-huh.\\
294 - Go on, go on.\\
295 - Grace Foster y el lechero\\
296 - se van a salir juntos...\\
297 - In English, in English!\\
298 - Grace Foster is running away with the
milkman\\
299 - and her husband doesn't suspect
anything.\\
300 - Go on.\\
301 - That is all.\\
302 - Ooh, Ethel will die when she hears
this.\\
303 - I can't keep it to myself another
minute.\\
304 - I'll call her right now.\\
305 - Gee, it's pretty late.\\
306 - I wonder what time it is.\\
307 - 4:00.\\
308 - Well, she might still be up.\\
309 - I can't tell her without losing that
bet.\\
310 - It would be gossip.\\
311 - Darn it!\\
312 - That's right, sleep, you big ox.\\
313 - What? What?\\
314 - What happened? What?
What happened?\\
315 - You must have been dreaming, dear.\\
316 - Oh... oh.\\
317 - Good night, dear.\\
318 - Good night.\\
319 - I'm a real stinker, all right.\\
320 - Ricky!\\
321 - Ricky!\\
322 - Hello, Fred.\\
323 - How did it go last night?\\
324 - Wonderful.\\
325 - She swallowed the whole story.\\
326 - How did it go with Ethel?\\
327 - Well, if she'd have flapped her ears
any more\\
328 - she would have taken off\\
329 - and circled the room.\\
330 - Listen, we're a cinch to win the bet.\\
331 - How do you know?\\
332 - Well, Lucy just announced\\
333 - that she's going to go downstairs\\
334 - and borrow a cup of flour from Ethel.\\
335 - Well, let's not waste any more time.\\
336 - Where are we going?\\
337 - We'll go down to the basement\\
338 - and listen through the furnace pipe.\\
339 - Good idea.\\
340 - Come on!\\
341 - Ricky, I'm going downstairs now.\\
342 - Ricky?\\
343 - Oh.
Oh.\\
344 - I just came up to borrow a cup of
sugar.\\
345 - I was just coming down to borrow a
cup of flour.\\
346 - Well, come on in, sit down.\\
347 - Okay.\\
348 - How about a cup of coffee?\\
349 - Uh, no, thanks.\\
350 - Um...\\
351 - how have you been?\\
352 - Oh, I've been fine, fine.\\
353 - I feel wonderful.\\
354 - How have you been?\\
355 - Great, great, never felt better.\\
356 - Well, let's drink to our good health.\\
357 - What's new?\\
358 - Um, uh...\\
359 - Nothing.\\
360 - What's new with you?\\
361 - Nothing.\\
362 - Dull, aren't we?\\
363 - Yeah.\\
364 - Well, I might as well go home.\\
365 - How about your sugar?\\
366 - Sugar?\\
367 - Oh, never mind.\\
368 - I really didn't need any flour
either.\\
369 - Well, so long.\\
370 - Bye.\\
371 - Drop up later, Ethel.\\
372 - I got a pudding in the oven.\\
373 - Pudding?\\
374 - What kind?\\
375 - Grace Foster...
I mean, brown betty!\\
376 - You know then!\\
377 - Yes, do you?\\
378 - Yes!\\
379 - Ricky, are you in there?\\
380 - What did you hear?\\
381 - I heard that Grace is getting ready\\
382 - to run away with the milkman!\\
383 - They're going to Mexico and get a
quick divorce\\
384 - and they're settling in Steubenville.\\
385 - Steubenville?!\\
386 - Yeah, he's got a new milk route.\\
387 - Well, if you ask me, I think her
husband is well rid of her.\\
388 - I think so too.\\
389 - I think so too.\\
390 - Ethel Mertz!\\
391 - What's that?\\
392 - You ought to be ashamed of yourself.\\
393 - Who's that?\\
394 - This is your conscience.\\
395 - You have been gossiping.\\
396 - Ethel, you've got the loudest
conscience I ever heard.\\
397 - Lucy Ricardo!\\
398 - This is your conscience.\\
399 - You've been goss'ping, too.\\
400 - Oh, fine, my conscience has an
accent.\\
401 - Ricky Ricardo, where are you?\\
402 - Fred and I are down in the basement.\\
403 - We listened to the whole thing\\
404 - through the furnace pipe.\\
405 - Looks like you've lost the bet,
girls.\\
406 - Oh!\\
407 - Keep them talking.\\
408 - What are you doing down there now?\\
409 - We knew you'd blab that phony
Grace Foster story\\
410 - to each other.\\
411 - Phony?\\
412 - Yes, we dreamt it up\\
413 - and told it to you last night in our
sleep.\\
414 - There! Maybe a little soot will teach
them\\
415 - not to be so smart next time.\\
416 - How do you like that?\\
417 - They deliberately tricked us.\\
418 - What a couple of fools we are.\\
419 - Now we got to give those two bums\\
420 - breakfast in bed for a month.\\
421 - What a revolting thought.\\
422 - Wait a minute!\\
423 - If they weren't asleep, they were
awake.\\
424 - Well, that's a monumental conclusion.\\
425 - No, no, I mean if they were awake\\
426 - when they told us that story\\
427 - they were gossiping.\\
428 - Yeah!\\
429 - How about that?\\
430 - Suddenly the breakfast is on the
other foot.\\
431 - Well, if it isn't the coal dust
twins.\\
432 - Very funny.\\
433 - All right, girls, we won the bet fair
and square.\\
434 - Didn't we, Fred?\\
435 - That we did.\\
436 - Now, let's see...\\
437 - tomorrow morning I would like some
orange juice\\
438 - two eggs basted, ham, toast, jam and
coffee.\\
439 - I'll have the same, sweetie.\\
440 - Well, that's just wonderful\\
441 - except for tomorrow morning, you'll
be serving it to us.\\
442 - She is so right.\\
443 - What do you mean?\\
444 - I mean you weren't really talking in
your sleep\\
445 - so you were gossiping first!\\
446 - Now, wait a minute, girls, wait a
minute.\\
447 - You have misconstrued\\
448 - the entire point of the situation.\\
449 - Now, you see, if the story were true\\
450 - then we would have been gossiping\\
451 - but the story was not true--\\
452 - we made it up.\\
453 - The whole thing was "friction"\\
454 - so we were not gossiping.\\
455 - Now, you girls believed that the
story was true\\
456 - so you were gossiping.\\
457 - Now, that's the whole thing.\\
458 - Oh, that is the silliest way\\
459 - of trying to crawl out of a bet....\\
460 - What do you mean, "friction"?\\
461 - Wait a minute!\\
462 - Good morning, your majesty.\\
463 - Good morning.\\
464 - That's nice.\\
465 - You're a very good wife.\\
466 - Thank you very much.\\
467 - Thank you.\\
468 - Ricky, don't start till I get
there!\\
469 - Fred, what are you doing up here?\\
470 - Well, I thought we ought to share our
moment of triumph.\\
471 - May I?\\
472 - Be my guest.\\
473 - Where are you, Ethel?\\
474 - Coming, master.\\
475 - This is the life, isn't it, Fred?\\
476 - We're living like kings.\\
477 - Why did you ever agree that they won
the bet?\\
478 - Well, Ethel, it would be different\\
479 - if that story about Grace Foster\\
480 - and the milkman was true, but it
wasn't.\\
481 - That's right.\\
482 - Absolutely.\\
483 - Help! Help! Save me! Help!\\
484 - What's this?
Who's that?\\
485 - Save me!
He's after me, he's after me!\\
486 - Who's after you?\\
487 - Oh, all my milk will turn sour.\\
488 - He's after me!
Who's after you?
Who's after you?\\
489 - Who's that?\\
490 - Mr. Foster, Mr. Foster!\\
491 - Mr. Foster?!\\
492 - Where can I hide?\\
493 - In there.
Oh...\\
494 - All right, where is
that...?\\
495 - Oh, help hide him, Lucy.\\
496 - What's going on here?\\
497 - Just watch me get my
hands on that little shrimp!\\
498 - That's all I want to do is find him!\\
499 - What do you mean breaking in here?\\
500 - What's going on here, Mr. Foster?\\
501 - I'll teach that cow juice peddler\\
502 - to flirt with my wife.\\
503 - Come on out, you cottage cheese
Casanova!\\
504 - What you doing there, you little
shrimp...\\
505 - Mr. Foster, now, now nothing can be
settled with a gun.\\
506 - No?\\
507 - You'll just go to jail.\\
508 - Wow.\\
509 - Now, you don't want to go to jail, do
you?\\
510 - No.\\
511 - Now... now, this is something that
should be settled\\
512 - between you and your wife, Grace.\\
513 - Yeah, I guess shooting him wouldn't
solve anything.\\
514 - It certainly wouldn't.\\
515 - I suppose maybe I ought to give Grace\\
516 - a chance to explain.\\
517 - That's right.\\
518 - Yeah.\\
519 - But let me tell you one thing.\\
520 - From now on, we drink goat's milk.\\
521 - So there's no truth to the story,
hey, fellas?\\
522 - Yeah, how about that, boys?\\
523 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
524 - I'll have honeydew melon filled with
strawberries\\
525 - eggs Benedict and hot chocolate.\\
526 - I'll have the same, Fatso.\\
527 - Eso es lo que quiere comer para el
desayuno--\\
528 - un pedazo de honeydew melon, Benedict
eggs\\
529 - filled with strawberry\\
530 - y chocolate caliente...\\
531 - Oh, I forgot all about you.\\
532 - You're safe now.\\
533 - What a break\\
534 - he chose this apartment to hide in.\\
535 - Would you hand me my purse there
please?\\
536 - Oh.\\
537 - Thank you.\\
538 - Now, here's five dollars for you\\
539 - and please give this five dollars to
Mr. Foster\\
540 - and tell him I said, "thank you very
much."\\
541 - You both gave wonderful performances.\\
542 - Aw, think nothing of it, Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
543 - Oh, with my compliments.\\
544 - Oh, thank you.\\
545 - It was a pleasure.\\
546 - Any time.\\
547 - Bye-bye.\\
548 - The part of the milkman\\
549 - was played by Bobby Jellison.\\

1 - Hi, Lucy.\\
2 - Ho. Hi, Ricky is in the living room,
Fred.\\
3 - Thank you.\\
4 - Hi, girl.
Hi.\\
5 - Did you tell Ricky yet?\\
6 - Uh-huh.\\
7 - Oh, I can hardly wait.\\
8 - Imagine us being members of the
Society Matrons League.\\
9 - Mm, I don't see how you got up nerve
enough\\
10 - to send in the application.\\
11 - Why not? It's just another club.\\
12 - Just another club?\\
13 - They're the cream of society.\\
14 - Well, we'll fit in perfectly.\\
15 - "How do you do,
Mrs. Mertz?\\
16 - It's so good to see you, my dear."\\
17 - "How do you do?"\\
18 - "Eh, how do you do?"\\
19 - Oh, dear.\\
20 - What's the matter?\\
21 - Do you suppose when we're introduced\\
22 - to those society- type husbands\\
23 - they'll try to kiss our hands?\\
24 - Well, if they kiss mine, they'll get
dishpan lips.\\
25 - Boy, I don't know how many dishes
I've washed\\
26 - since we've been married.\\
27 - I don't either.\\
28 - Let's see-- 20 dishes a meal, three
meals a day\\
29 - 306... I'm going to figure this out.\\
30 - 20 dishes a meal\\
31 - three meals a day...
365 days a year...\\
32 - uh, four, five...
two, three, four.\\
33 - We've been married for ten years.\\
34 - 219,000 dishes!\\
35 - No kidding?\\
36 - How about that!\\
37 - Come on, Mrs. Mertz.\\
38 - Where are we going?\\
39 - We're going to revolt.\\
40 - We are going in there and demand\\
41 - that our husbands buy us electric
dishwashers.\\
42 - I'm with you.\\
43 - Don't you ever throw anything but
deuces?\\
44 - Ricky?\\
45 - Fred?\\
46 - We're revolting.\\
47 - No more than usual.\\
48 - We didn't mean that.\\
49 - Now, listen, Ricky, I just figured
this out.\\
50 - Since you and I have been married\\
51 - I have washed 219,000 dishes.\\
52 - No!\\
53 - You can imagine how many I've washed.\\
54 - Yeah, must be up in the millions!\\
55 - Lucy!\\
56 - Well, I was just trying to make a
point.\\
57 - Oh.\\
58 - Would you mind telling us\\
59 - what this is all leading up to?\\
60 - Gladly.\\
61 - There's a wonderful invention on the
market\\
62 - that makes it impossible\\
63 - for about-to-be society matrons like
us\\
64 - to get rough, red hands in dishwater\\
65 - and we think it would be\\
66 - a wonderful, wonderful investment.\\
67 - Well, so do I.\\
68 - You do!?\\
69 - Certainly.
Hey!\\
70 - They want us to buy them some rubber
gloves.\\
71 - I had reference to an automatic
dishwasher.\\
72 - Well, forget it, honey.\\
73 - Why?\\
74 - I can't afford it.\\
75 - I can't even afford rubber gloves.\\
76 - Oh, well, nice try, Lucy.\\
77 - Oh!\\
78 - Isn't it amazing\\
79 - how spoiled modern women are?\\
80 - Spoiled?\\
81 - Yes, spoiled.\\
82 - You got to do a little work\\
83 - and you think it's terrible.\\
84 - A little work!\\
85 - Why, honey, this is the electric age.\\
86 - All you have to do is flip a swish.\\
87 - We flip a "swish."\\
88 - Listen, your grandmothers didn't have\\
89 - any of these modern electrical
conveniences\\
90 - and they not only washed the dishes\\
91 - but they swept the floor, they
churned the butter\\
92 - they baked the bread, they did the
laundry\\
93 - and they made their own clothes.\\
94 - Sure. Where are those women today?\\
95 - Dead.\\
96 - You know what I mean.\\
97 - I'd like to see you girls run the
house\\
98 - without any of these modern
conveniences.\\
99 - Well, what about you guys?\\
100 - Yeah. You couldn't get along with
them\\
101 - any better than we could.\\
102 - Aw, honey, we're men, we're rugged.\\
103 - Yeah!\\
104 - They're rugged.\\
105 - Why don't you put your money where
your big mouth is.\\
106 - Meaning what?\\
107 - Meaning that we'll just try\\
108 - living without any modern
conveniences\\
109 - and we'll see who yells "uncle"
first--\\
110 - the men or the women.\\
111 - Okay.
Okay.\\
112 - Okay, what do you want to bet?\\
113 - How about $10?\\
114 - What's the matter with $20?\\
115 - Well, what's the matter with $30?\\
116 - What's the matter with $50?\\
117 - What was the matter with $10?\\
118 - Okay, 50 bucks!\\
119 - What are the rules?\\
120 - Well...\\
121 - I know.\\
122 - We'll pick a year, like 1900\\
123 - and we won't use\\
124 - anything that was invented after
that.\\
125 - Good. 1900.\\
126 - Uh, did they use electric lights\\
127 - before then, Fred?\\
128 - Don't look at me-- ask Ethel.\\
129 - Now, listen, you old...\\
130 - Never mind, never mind.\\
131 - 1900. That's a good date.\\
132 - Okay, tomorrow we all go back\\
133 - to the gay '90s.\\
134 - 23 Skidoo!\\
135 - Morning, Lucy.\\
136 - Hi, Ethel.\\
137 - What's all this?\\
138 - I've been shopping in a junk store.\\
139 - Say, those lamps are a good idea.\\
140 - I was going to use candles.\\
141 - How's Ricky?\\
142 - Has he run into any snags yet?\\
143 - Well, not really.\\
144 - He got very upset when he found out\\
145 - he couldn't use his electric razor.\\
146 - So did Fred.\\
147 - And what a fuss he made.\\
148 - I don't see anything so tough\\
149 - about shaving with a sharp-edged
razor\\
150 - and cold water, do you?\\
151 - No.\\
152 - Fred just refused to shave at all.\\
153 - No kidding.\\
154 - What's that?\\
155 - Oh, look at this.\\
156 - A bathtub!\\
157 - Lucy, you're not going to make Ricky\\
158 - take a bath in that?\\
159 - Why not?\\
160 - We want to win the bet, don't we?\\
161 - Yeah.\\
162 - Lucy!\\
163 - Lucy!\\
164 - Yeah, yeah?\\
165 - Lucy, I want...\\
166 - Oh. Good morning, Ethel.\\
167 - Hi.\\
168 - Look at all this junk.\\
169 - Is breakfast ready?\\
170 - Well, I was just about to fix it,
dear.\\
171 - What'll you have?\\
172 - Coffee, toast, a transfusion?\\
173 - Never mind that.\\
174 - Is breakfast ready?\\
175 - I'll fix it for you right now.\\
176 - Hey, you can't use the electric
stove, you know.\\
177 - Oh, yes, I can.\\
178 - Lucy!
Lucy, you...!\\
179 - You can't light that.\\
180 - This is the way my grandmother
cooked.\\
181 - This stove is not built that way.\\
182 - It won't work.\\
183 - It'll set the house on fire.\\
184 - All right, do you want to eat cold
food?\\
185 - Well, I guess we'll have to
compromise.\\
186 - You can use the stove, but nothing
else.\\
187 - Thank you.\\
188 - Where's my coffee?\\
189 - Coming up, sire.\\
190 - My grandmother was Swedish.\\
191 - Howdy, neighbors.\\
192 - Hi, Fred.\\
193 - Hello, Fred.\\
194 - I thought I'd find you up here,
Ethel.\\
195 - We are out of butter.\\
196 - Oh, dear.\\
197 - I'll run down to the store for some.\\
198 - Ethel, if you're going out for butter\\
199 - will you get me a loaf of bread,
please?\\
200 - Sure.\\
201 - Now, just a minute, my pretty maid.\\
202 - My grandmother churned her own
butter.\\
203 - Yeah!\\
204 - Churned?\\
205 - Yeah.\\
206 - That's right.\\
207 - And my grandmother baked her own
bread.\\
208 - Baked? Like I bake a cake?\\
209 - I hope not.\\
210 - Bake bread.\\
211 - Churn butter.\\
212 - Yeah.\\
213 - Well, you'd like to call off the bet?\\
214 - No!
No!\\
215 - You churn a little extra butter for
me\\
216 - and I'll bake a little extra bread
for you.\\
217 - Hi, Ethel, how's the butter churner?\\
218 - Oh, I've been churning\\
219 - for two hours.\\
220 - Well, you deserve a rest.\\
221 - Put that thing down.\\
222 - I can't!\\
223 - Pry me loose, will ya?\\
224 - My hands are beginning to grow to
this thing.\\
225 - Are you kidding?\\
226 - I can't get them off.\\
227 - Well, maybe you can pull it right out
that way, huh?\\
228 - Pull!
Well, relax now, relax.\\
229 - I can't! Pull!\\
230 - Oh!\\
231 - You poor kid!\\
232 - Oh, gosh!\\
233 - How much butter did you make?\\
234 - None.\\
235 - You've been churning for two hours\\
236 - and you didn't make any butter?\\
237 - Our grandmothers must have had arms\\
238 - like Gorgeous George.\\
239 - How long does it take milk to turn
into butter?\\
240 - Ethel, you have to start with cream
to make butter.\\
241 - Anybody knows that.\\
242 - My goodness!\\
243 - Oh, cream!\\
244 - Certainly.\\
245 - Oh. How you coming with the bread?\\
246 - Well, it-it's very interesting.\\
247 - You see, you mix everything together\\
248 - you put the yeast in, you mix it all
up\\
249 - and you knead it, knead it.\\
250 - This it what you call "kneading" it,
see?\\
251 - Yeah.\\
252 - And then you let it set, and it
rises, see?\\
253 - And then you take it out, and you
knead it again.\\
254 - And you let it set, and it rises some
more.\\
255 - Then you put it in the oven, and you
bake it.\\
256 - Well, that sounds simple.\\
257 - Sure. I had to go to three, four
stores\\
258 - before I could get enough yeast,
though.\\
259 - Why? How much did you need?\\
260 - 13 cakes.\\
261 - 13 cakes?\\
262 - That seems like an awful lot.\\
263 - Well, here's the recipe right here.\\
264 - Let me see.\\
265 - Lucy.\\
266 - What?\\
267 - Three cakes.\\
268 - Oh, really?\\
269 - Oh, well, they're small.\\
270 - It won't make much difference.\\
271 - Well, now you have to put it in a
bowl.\\
272 - Mm-hmm.\\
273 - There.\\
274 - "Now set in warm place to rise."\\
275 - Yeah, and I'm going to put it\\
276 - right down here by the oven.\\
277 - Okay.\\
278 - Oh! Now, let's get back to the butter
department.\\
279 - All right.\\
280 - Gosh!\\
281 - Ethel, help me.\\
282 - Oh.\\
283 - Can you lift it?\\
284 - Gee, I must have hurt this some way.\\
285 - What do you mean?\\
286 - It's all swollen.\\
287 - I told you that was too much yeast.\\
288 - Well, I just won't have to bake again
so soon.\\
289 - Now I have to knead it again.\\
290 - Yeah.\\
291 - And then I have to let it set again.\\
292 - Yeah.\\
293 - There now.\\
294 - Oh. You want to get me a bigger bowl?\\
295 - Here?\\
296 - Yeah.\\
297 - How's this, Lucy?\\
298 - Okay... ooh!\\
299 - You think that's enough?\\
300 - Yeah.\\
301 - Oh!\\
302 - Sorry, honey, I'm sorry.\\
303 - There.\\
304 - Now I let that set and that rises.\\
305 - You better help me.\\
306 - Yeah, I thought so.\\
307 - There. Back to the butter.\\
308 - See, I told you that cream would do
the trick.\\
309 - Imagine-- all that butter\\
310 - and it only cost me $23.75.\\
311 - Ethel!\\
312 - Oh, Lucy!\\
313 - Oh, oh, my...\\
314 - Ethel!
I've got it.\\
315 - That's awful heavy.\\
316 - Let me help.\\
317 - Oh! Oh, oh!\\
318 - Oh!
Oh...\\
319 - Get this out of here.\\
320 - You want some help?\\
321 - Ow! Look, wait a minute.\\
322 - Let me turn the bowl.\\
323 - Oh!\\
324 - I think this has grown to the bowl.\\
325 - Here, put the bowl over there.\\
326 - My goodness!\\
327 - Well, it's a happy, little loaf,
isn't it?\\
328 - I have to knead this.\\
329 - All right.\\
330 - I'll hold the board.\\
331 - Whoa!\\
332 - Oh!\\
333 - Ethel! Ethel!\\
334 - Whoa! Hang on now!\\
335 - Oh, Ethel, help me put it on the
board!\\
336 - Put it up on the board!\\
337 - I'm sorry, Ethel.\\
338 - Get that pan over there.\\
339 - A pan?\\
340 - Yeah.\\
341 - How's this?\\
342 - All right.\\
343 - Oh, wait a minute\\
344 - there's a yeast bit there.\\
345 - I got it, I got it.\\
346 - Where?\\
347 - There it is, over there.\\
348 - All right, ready?\\
349 - Ready.\\
350 - Whoo!\\
351 - Now I have to...\\
352 - I have to shape it into a loaf.\\
353 - Yeah?\\
354 - Open the oven.\\
355 - Oh, open the oven.\\
356 - There.\\
357 - You ready?\\
358 - Come on, now, yeah.\\
359 - Look out.\\
360 - Oh!
Oh!\\
361 - There.\\
362 - Now, let's see.\\
363 - The oven's all preheated\\
364 - like it says\\
365 - and in a couple of hours\\
366 - we'll have some nice homemade bread.\\
367 - And butter.\\
368 - Yeah. What's so tough\\
369 - about this pioneering business?\\
370 - Let's play canasta.\\
371 - Okay.\\
372 - Don't you look at my hand, now.\\
373 - Oh, telegram.\\
374 - Thank you.\\
375 - Oh, Ethel, it's from the Society
Matrons League!\\
376 - We're in, we're in!\\
377 - No kidding.\\
378 - Look at this!\\
379 - Let me see, let me see.\\
380 - "You are invited to a tea\\
381 - "Friday afternoon at the Waldorf\\
382 - to be scrutinized..."\\
383 - Scrutinized?\\
384 - That's what it says.\\
385 - "Before your final acceptance\\
386 - into the Society Matrons League."
Yippee!\\
387 - Oh, isn't that wonderful?!
Oh, yes.\\
388 - Now, we have to look real sharp on
Friday.\\
389 - We have to go to the beauty parlor\\
390 - and we have to get the works:\\
391 - a-a shampoo, a fingerwave, a
manicure, a pedicure\\
392 - a permanent...\\
393 - Oh, wait a minute, Lucy.\\
394 - What?\\
395 - If we go to a modern beauty parlor\\
396 - we'll lose that bet with the boys.\\
397 - Oh, gosh.\\
398 - Oh, it looks like it'll cost us\\
399 - 50 bucks apiece to be Society
Matrons.\\
400 - Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.\\
401 - There must be some way.\\
402 - I know, Ethel, our clothes.\\
403 - What do you mean?\\
404 - Well, if we... if we were really
living in 1900\\
405 - we'd be wearing bustles and corsets\\
406 - and the fellows would be wearing\\
407 - high-button shoes and celluloid
collars\\
408 - and those skimpy suits all the time.\\
409 - You mean, on the street and down to
work?\\
410 - All the time\\
411 - and you know they'd never agree to
that\\
412 - and we'd win the bet.\\
413 - You're right.\\
414 - Hey, do you smell bread?\\
415 - Maybe it's done.\\
416 - How did the oven door get open?\\
417 - Ethel! Ethel, help!\\
418 - Oh, Ethel!\\
419 - Oh, Ethel!\\
420 - Ethel, I'm stuck!\\
421 - Ethel, get me out!\\
422 - Oh, Ethel!\\
423 - Hurry up!
Hurry up!\\
424 - Oh! Watch out for my leg!\\
425 - Watch out for my leg!\\
426 - Ethel, watch out, it'll drop in my
lap!\\
427 - Hi, Ethel.\\
428 - How do I look?\\
429 - Oh, you look wonderful!\\
430 - How do I look?\\
431 - Like a doll\\
432 - like an old-fashioned doll.\\
433 - Fred's in the bathtub.\\
434 - I hid all of his clothes\\
435 - and left the old-fashioned ones.\\
436 - Oh, good girl.\\
437 - That's what I'm going to do to Ricky.\\
438 - Gee, I hope this works, Lucy.\\
439 - It will, but if it doesn't, I just
had another thought.\\
440 - What?\\
441 - Well, you know\\
442 - I never mentioned transportation to
Ricky\\
443 - so I'm going to watch out the window
tonight\\
444 - and if he comes home\\
445 - in a cab, a bus or a subway\\
446 - we win the bet.\\
447 - Ah, that's wonderful.\\
448 - We're in.\\
449 - I'll see you later.\\
450 - Okay.\\
451 - Oh, no!\\
452 - Ridi pagliaccio\\
453 - Oh, don't be so happy.\\
454 - Ah, honey, I love living in the turn
of the century.\\
455 - I love a hot bath, too.\\
456 - Here are your clothes.\\
457 - What, my clothes!?\\
458 - Those old-fashioned- looking things?\\
459 - Yeah. You thought it was fine that I
was wearing them.\\
460 - Now wait a minute, honey, it's
different with you.\\
461 - You stay in the house all day.\\
462 - I got to go out on the street and be
seen by people.\\
463 - Sorry!\\
464 - Now Lucy, you can't be serious\\
465 - about me wearing these clothes.\\
466 - I got to go out on the street.\\
467 - I got to...\\
468 - Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
Lucy, look out, look out!\\
469 - Hi, kiddo.\\
470 - I am the chicken inspector.\\
471 - And it's my day to crow.\\
472 - With a little razzmatazz.\\
473 - What's with him?\\
474 - He likes those clothes.\\
475 - What do I care what kind of clothes I
wear\\
476 - just to fix the plumbing?\\
477 - Besides, these remind me of the days\\
478 - when I was a gay, young blade.\\
479 - While strolling through the park one
day\\
480 - In the merry, merry month of may\\
481 - I was taken by surprise\\
482 - By a pair of roguish eyes\\
483 - While strolling through the park one
day\\
484 - In may.\\
485 - Very good, old man.\\
486 - Thank you, sir.\\
487 - You know, Lucy, you gave me a great
idea.\\
488 - I'm going to put a gay '90s number\\
489 - down at the club.\\
490 - Now just a minute, Ricky.\\
491 - You know you have to wear those
clothes all the time\\
492 - not just down at the club.\\
493 - I know, honey.\\
494 - Be a wonderful advertisement\\
495 - for the show!\\
496 - Oh!
Oh, fine.\\
497 - Hey, Rick, doesn't Ethel look
cute?\\
498 - But what are you wearing that bustle
for, honey?\\
499 - You don't need it.\\
500 - Pay no attention to him.\\
501 - You leave it on.\\
502 - I'm not wearing a bustle.\\
503 - Eww!\\
504 - Uh, is this the Ricardo residence?\\
505 - Yes, I'm Mrs. Ricardo.\\
506 - Good. I'm Mrs. Pettibone.
This is Mrs. Pomerance.\\
507 - We're the surprise investigating
committee\\
508 - for the Society Matrons League.\\
509 - Oh... oh!\\
510 - Uh, oh, won't you come in, please?\\
511 - Oh!\\
512 - Uh, oh, this is Mr. and Mrs...\\
513 - I mean, Mr. and Mrs. Mertz.\\
514 - Hiya!\\
515 - Uh, and this is my husband, Mr. uh...
uh...\\
516 - Ricardo... Ricardo.\\
517 - Mr. Ricardo.\\
518 - Won't you sit down, please?\\
519 - Um...\\
520 - we pop in like this unexpectedly\\
521 - so as to investigate\\
522 - how our prospective members really
live.\\
523 - Oh.\\
524 - We want to make sure they're not
bringing\\
525 - their best foot forward just for us.\\
526 - Uh, do you dress like this normally?\\
527 - Well, I...\\
528 - Oh, it's not an every, uh...\\
529 - Not as a...\\
530 - Er, uh...\\
531 - Oh, I see.\\
532 - Uh, do you mind if we look around?\\
533 - Uh, no, of course not.\\
534 - Help yourselves.\\
535 - Uh, where's the kitchen, please?\\
536 - The kitchen?\\
537 - Thank you.\\
538 - What are we going to do?\\
539 - I don't know, what can we do?\\
540 - Ricky, Ricky, you can think of
something, can't you?\\
541 - Sure.\\
542 - What?\\
543 - You want to call off the bet?\\
544 - No.
No!\\
545 - All right, honey, all right.\\
546 - I know how much this means to you.\\
547 - I got an idea.\\
548 - What?\\
549 - I'll tell them that we're putting on\\
550 - an act together for our club\\
551 - and they caught us right in the
middle of rehearsal.\\
552 - Oh, honey, That's wonderful.\\
553 - Thank you.\\
554 - Quite interesting.\\
555 - Quaint, to say the least.\\
556 - Eh, ladies, eh, I know what you must
think.\\
557 - You do?\\
558 - Uh, yes, you see, you chose the wrong
time\\
559 - for your investigation.\\
560 - I mean, that is to see the way that
we really live.\\
561 - You see, eh, we're putting an act
together for my club\\
562 - and you caught us right in the middle
of rehearsal.\\
563 - You put on shows?\\
564 - Yes.\\
565 - Why?\\
566 - Why not?\\
567 - I mean, uh, do you do this for a
living?\\
568 - Oh, no, no.\\
569 - We just developed a bad habit.\\
570 - We like to eat.\\
571 - Show people.\\
572 - Uh, Matilda, we've been allowing show
people\\
573 - to join for several seasons now.\\
574 - Oh, yes, it happened three years ago\\
575 - when we needed money.\\
576 - Um, well, we're willing to make
allowances.\\
577 - We'll look you over\\
578 - at the Friday afternoon tea, ladies.\\
579 - Good afternoon, gentlemen.\\
580 - Uh, just a minute, just a minute,
just a minute.\\
581 - What do you mean, "make allowances"?\\
582 - What's wrong with show people?\\
583 - Well, you must admit\\
584 - that most of them are a little,
uh-uh...\\
585 - My dear Mrs. Ricardo\\
586 - please don't misunderstand me.\\
587 - The Society Matrons League as a body\\
588 - does not disapprove of show people as
such.\\
589 - Mm-hmm, well, perhaps\\
590 - we have something against the League.\\
591 - When you get back to your
blue-blooded sisters\\
592 - tell them that the Ricardo/Mertz\\
593 - investigating committee looked you
over\\
594 - and we have no desire to join\\
595 - your phony baloney club!\\
596 - Yeah, tell them that.\\
597 - Go ahead, tell them that.\\
598 - Well!\\
599 - Well, I guess we'd better leave!\\
600 - Good afternoon.\\
601 - So long, kids.\\
602 - Oh, Lucy, you were wonderful!\\
603 - Ha, ha, baby, I love you!\\
604 - You told those bats.\\
605 - Yeah.\\
606 - Oh, Lucy, you said all the things\\
607 - I was trying to think of and
couldn't.\\
608 - Ah, sweetheart, I'm so proud of you.\\
609 - I'm going to give you the $50 and
call off the bet.\\
610 - Oh, Ricky, that's wonderful!\\
611 - Listen, honey, I'm starved.\\
612 - Let's go out to dinner, eh?\\
613 - Good.\\
614 - We got plenty of food right here.\\
615 - Well, where?
Wha...?\\
616 - Right here.\\
617 - Homemade bread with home-churned
butter.\\
618 - Dive in, everybody.\\
619 - The last one in the middle\\
620 - is a rotten egg!

\subsection {Episode 26: The Marriage License (1952)}
1 - Hi, Lucy. I'm going down to the
store.\\
2 - Do you want...
What are you doing?\\
3 - Cleaning out the desk.\\
4 - Hasn't been done in a year.
Boy, what a mess.\\
5 - They sure fill up with junk, don't
they?
I'll say.\\
6 - Is this the stuff you're throwing
away?\\
7 - No, that's the stuff I'm keeping.\\
8 - What I'm throwing away is in the
wastebasket.\\
9 - You're sure getting rid of a lot.\\
10 - Now, here's something no home should
be without.\\
11 - What is it?\\
12 - I don't know.\\
13 - Why don't you throw it away?\\
14 - Well, I can't till I find out what it
is.\\
15 - Might be something I need.\\
16 - I give up.\\
17 - Don't you ever throw anything away?\\
18 - Not very often, no.\\
19 - Everything brings back some sort of a
memory.\\
20 - For instance, these are mementos\\
21 - from all our wedding anniversaries.\\
22 - I keep something from each one.\\
23 - Oh, Lucy, you're an incurable
sentimentalist.\\
24 - Yeah, I'm sticky over Ricky.\\
25 - Here's our marriage license.\\
26 - Aw.\\
27 - This is the little piece of paper\\
28 - that changed my name to "Ricardo."\\
29 - "On this day, Lucille Esmeralda
MacGillicuddy\\
30 - "was married to Ricky...\\
31 - Bicardi"?\\
32 - Bicardi?\\
33 - Yeah, B-I-C-A-R-D-I.\\
34 - I never noticed that before--\\
35 - must be a mistake in typing.\\
36 - Well, it doesn't make any difference.\\
37 - Well, I don't know.\\
38 - You know how funny the laws are.\\
39 - Gee.\\
40 - Ethel, you don't suppose\\
41 - this license isn't legal, do you?\\
42 - Oh, of course it's legal.\\
43 - Don't be ridiculous, Lucy.\\
44 - Hey, I never saw this picture of you
two in a canoe before.\\
45 - When was it taken?\\
46 - Last summer, when Mr. Bicardi and I
were at the lake.\\
47 - Now, Lucy, you're not going\\
48 - to worry about that, are you?\\
49 - No.\\
50 - You are, too, aren't you?\\
51 - Yes.\\
52 - Well, it's just a simple clerical
error.\\
53 - Well, what if it matters?\\
54 - Maybe for ten years\\
55 - Ricky and I would have been null and
void.\\
56 - Hi, honey, hi, Ethel.\\
57 - Hi.\\
58 - How's my little wife?\\
59 - What's the matter with her?\\
60 - She's off on another one.\\
61 - Well, good luck, Mr. Bicardi.\\
62 - What?\\
63 - What's she talking about?\\
64 - What happened, honey?\\
65 - I was cleaning out the desk\\
66 - and I found this.\\
67 - That's our marriage license.\\
68 - Yeah.\\
69 - Well, what's the matter?\\
70 - Don't tell me it's expired.\\
71 - Read it.\\
72 - "On this day, Lucille Esmeralda
MacGillicuddy\\
73 - was married to Ricky Ricardo."\\
74 - To Ricky who?\\
75 - "Ricky Ric...\\
76 - Bicardi"?\\
77 - Oh, that's what she was talking
about.\\
78 - Well, honey, it's just a mistake.\\
79 - I'll say it is!\\
80 - We've never been married.\\
81 - Never been married?\\
82 - No.\\
83 - Oh, now, sweetheart\\
84 - you're making a big thing out of
nothing.\\
85 - Nothing?\\
86 - Suppose there is a Ricky Bicardi.\\
87 - For all I know\\
88 - I might be married to a rum factory.\\
89 - Now, honey, you're being completely
ridiculous about this.\\
90 - Well, I want you to call your lawyer\\
91 - and ask him if we're legally married.\\
92 - Well, honey, my lawyer is out of town\\
93 - and besides, I'd feel silly...\\
94 - I'm going to call the City Hall.\\
95 - I'm going to get ahold of the License
Bureau\\
96 - and I'm going to find out.\\
97 - Give me the City Hall, please.\\
98 - Well, this is an emergency.\\
99 - Thank you.\\
100 - Hello, City Hall?\\
101 - There's a mistake on my license\\
102 - and I want to talk to someone about
it.\\
103 - What do you mean, "Call the tail
waggers"?\\
104 - It's... it's not a dog license, it's
a marriage license.\\
105 - Oh.\\
106 - Hello, Marriage Bureau?\\
107 - There's a mistake on my license\\
108 - and I want to know if it makes any
difference.\\
109 - Oh. All right, I'll be right down.\\
110 - They say they have to see it.\\
111 - Oh, honey, you're not going to go\\
112 - all the way down to the City Hall,
are you?\\
113 - Now, honey, I just can't rest\\
114 - until I find out.\\
115 - I'll be back as soon as I can.\\
116 - Ay, esta mujer esta completamente
loca.\\
117 - Casada por diez anos y todos los anos\\
118 - se pone peor y peor y peor de la
cabeza, esa muchacha.\\
119 - Hi, Rick.\\
120 - Oh, hi, Fred.\\
121 - Oh, sorry, I didn't know\\
122 - you were having a nap.\\
123 - That's all right.\\
124 - I got to get dressed anyway.\\
125 - Ethel just told me\\
126 - about the mistake in your marriage
license.\\
127 - Isn't that silly?\\
128 - Yeah, I just got ours out\\
129 - and took a look at it.\\
130 - Some darn fool spelled my name right.\\
131 - Well, it wouldn't make any difference
anyway, Fred.\\
132 - I know. I thought I could worm out on
a technicality.\\
133 - Lucy was so worried\\
134 - that she went all the way down to the
License Bureau\\
135 - to find out how we stand.\\
136 - I wish I'd have known that.\\
137 - I got a good friend down there.\\
138 - I'd have called him for her.\\
139 - They won't tell her on the phone
anyway.\\
140 - Oh.\\
141 - I wonder what'd happen if this guy
tells her\\
142 - that the license is no good.\\
143 - Oh, no.\\
144 - Hey, how well do you know this guy?\\
145 - Well, he's a pretty good friend of
mine. Why?\\
146 - He is, eh?\\
147 - Yeah.\\
148 - I was just thinking\\
149 - suppose you call this guy down there\\
150 - just for a gag, you know, and tell
him\\
151 - that when Lucy gets down there\\
152 - to tell her that the license is no
good\\
153 - and that we're not married at all.\\
154 - Do you think he'll do it?\\
155 - Oh, I know he'll do it.\\
156 - Any word from Lucy yet?\\
157 - No.\\
158 - It's 9:00.\\
159 - The License Bureau closed at 5:30.\\
160 - Where can she possibly be?\\
161 - I don't know.\\
162 - Oh, it's all my fault.\\
163 - Oh, there she is now.\\
164 - Honey, I've been so worried about
you...\\
165 - Don't.\\
166 - What's the matter?\\
167 - I'm no longer yours to touch.\\
168 - Well, now, Lucy, now, look, hon...\\
169 - Did you see the man at the License
Bureau?\\
170 - Yes.\\
171 - We've been revoked.\\
172 - No!\\
173 - I didn't know what to do\\
174 - so I've just been walking.\\
175 - You've been walking all this
time?\\
176 - Well, the last hour\\
177 - I was on a train coming home.\\
178 - On a train?\\
179 - Where did you walk to?\\
180 - East Orange, New Jersey.\\
181 - How I ever got through the Holland
Tunnel, I don't know.\\
182 - Hey, you really took that news
seriously.\\
183 - Well, how do you think you'd feel\\
184 - if you suddenly found out you weren't
married to Ethel?\\
185 - Yeah!\\
186 - Now, look, honey, look, sweetie\\
187 - I got something to tell you, honey.\\
188 - Oh, I know what you're going to say,
dear.\\
189 - No, honey, you don't, and this is
very important\\
190 - so don't stop me.
Now, look...\\
191 - I know what you're going to say,
baby--\\
192 - that you still love me\\
193 - and that it doesn't make any
difference to you\\
194 - whether we're legally married or not.\\
195 - Oh, Ricky, it's so wonderful of you.\\
196 - That's what you were going to say,
wasn't it, dear?\\
197 - Yeah. Yeah, honey, yeah.\\
198 - Well, I thought it all over\\
199 - and there's only one thing for us to
do.\\
200 - What's that, honey?\\
201 - Get married again right away.\\
202 - Married again?\\
203 - Of course!\\
204 - Oh, isn't this exciting!\\
205 - And I don't want anything\\
206 - to spoil my memories of our first
marriage--\\
207 - the one that didn't take.\\
208 - So we're going to do the whole thing
over again\\
209 - exactly as we did before, starting
with the proposal.\\
210 - You mean we got to go all the way\\
211 - up to Connecticut?\\
212 - You mean you don't want to?\\
213 - Oh, yeah, honey, sure, I want to.\\
214 - Yeah, baby, I'd like to do it.
Okay.\\
215 - Okay, we'll start the first thing in
the morning.\\
216 - We'll find that same little bench\\
217 - and you'll propose in the same way\\
218 - and we'll be married by the same
justice of the peace\\
219 - and we'll stay overnight at the Byram
River Beagle Club\\
220 - and-and we'll do everything just the
way we did before.\\
221 - Honey, it's 125 miles\\
222 - to the Beagle Byram River Club\\
223 - and I got a rehearsal the next
morning.\\
224 - Well, we'll get back in plenty of
time.\\
225 - Come on, Ethel.\\
226 - Good night, Ricky.\\
227 - Lucy, where are you going?\\
228 - Pardon me.\\
229 - My dear Mr. Ricardo\\
230 - surely you don't expect me to stay
here.\\
231 - You're a bachelor, remember?\\
232 - Lucy, now wait a minute.\\
233 - Lucy!\\
234 - You got to have a friend down at the
License Bureau.\\
235 - Well, I know it's around in
here someplace, Ricky.\\
236 - It's got to be, because I know...\\
237 - Oh, here it is! Here it is, the same
little bench.\\
238 - I told you it was in here.\\
239 - Come on, Ricky!\\
240 - Coming, coming.\\
241 - Well, the least you could do is help
me with this stuff.\\
242 - Why do you make me carry everything?\\
243 - Before we were married\\
244 - you insisted on carrying everything,
remember?\\
245 - Oh, yeah.\\
246 - Oh, honey!\\
247 - Gee, I don't remember\\
248 - this seat being so small, do you?\\
249 - I guess the trees grew in a little
from each side.\\
250 - Let's face it.\\
251 - We've grown out a little from each
side.\\
252 - Gee, doesn't just being here make you
feel romantic, Ricky?\\
253 - Yeah.\\
254 - Let's eat, huh?\\
255 - The last time you were here\\
256 - you said, "Who needs food?\\
257 - I want to feast on your beauty."\\
258 - Oh. Who needs food?\\
259 - I want to feast on your beauty.\\
260 - You bring any mustard?\\
261 - Somehow, it sounds different than it
did then.\\
262 - Honey, what you want to start with--\\
263 - chicken salad or peanut butter?\\
264 - I want to start with a proposal.\\
265 - Before we eat?\\
266 - Now, Ricky, down on your knee.\\
267 - Oh, honey, the ground is all wet.\\
268 - Down on your knee.\\
269 - Now, I want everything\\
270 - just the way it was before.\\
271 - All right, honey, all right.\\
272 - Okay.\\
273 - Down on my knees.\\
274 - You know, I even took your wallet\\
275 - out of your pocket and left it home.\\
276 - My wallet? Why?
What did you do that for?\\
277 - Don't you remember?\\
278 - That day you left your wallet at home\\
279 - and I had to pay for the license.\\
280 - Oh, yeah.\\
281 - Well, go ahead with the proposal.\\
282 - Uh...\\
283 - You took my hand...\\
284 - Oh.\\
285 - Uh...\\
286 - um...\\
287 - Lucy, I love you madly.\\
288 - Lucy, I love you madly.\\
289 - Lucy, I can't live without you.\\
290 - Lucy, I can't live without you.\\
291 - Why did you take my wallet?\\
292 - Now I don't have my driver's license!\\
293 - I know-- I know I don't deserve\\
294 - a wonderful girl like you.\\
295 - I know I don't deserve...\\
296 - Take my hand.\\
297 - Oh. I know I don't deserve\\
298 - a wonderful girl like you.\\
299 - Lucy, will you marry me?\\
300 - Lucy, will you marry me?\\
301 - What's the matter?\\
302 - Well, this is a pretty important step\\
303 - in my life.\\
304 - I don't want to be rushed into
anything.\\
305 - What?!\\
306 - It's a good thing to know where I
stand.\\
307 - Honey, I was just kidding you.\\
308 - Come on, sit down.\\
309 - No!
Come on, sit down,\\
310 - I'll propose, honey. Come on.
Never mind.\\
311 - Oh, come on, honey.
Let me do it right.\\
312 - Sit down, I'll propose.
No.\\
313 - It's a pretty big step for me, too\\
314 - and I don't want to be rushed into
anything.\\
315 - Well, honey, can't you...\\
316 - can't you take a joke?\\
317 - What's funny about your not wanting
to marry me?\\
318 - Oh, honey, I do want to marry you. I
do...\\
319 - You do not. You do not.\\
320 - The real truth slips out.\\
321 - Oh, now, Lucy, baby.\\
322 - Don't "Lucy baby" me!\\
323 - From now on, I'm Miss MacGillicuddy
to you.\\
324 - and for your information\\
325 - I wouldn't marry you if you were
Xavier Cugat!\\
326 - Lucy!\\
327 - Honey, look!\\
328 - Xavier Cugat?!\\
329 - Lucy!\\
330 - "The Eagle Hotel." I don't know why\\
331 - you couldn't remember to put gas in
the car.\\
332 - Even if I had remembered, I couldn't
have paid for it.\\
333 - You took my wallet.\\
334 - That's no excuse.\\
335 - No excuse.\\
336 - Isn't there anybody alive in this
town?\\
337 - What town?\\
338 - Fire! Fire!\\
339 - Start the engines pumping!\\
340 - Where's the ladder?\\
341 - Get the hose!\\
342 - Where's the fire?\\
343 - There is no fire.\\
344 - Well, I heard the bell.\\
345 - I saw the flames.\\
346 - Oh... must have been your hair.\\
347 - Well, sir...\\
348 - what can I do for you?\\
349 - I'm Burt Willoughby, Fire Chief of
this here fair city.\\
350 - Well, look, Mr. Willoughby\\
351 - you know that gasoline station across
the street?\\
352 - There's nobody there.
You know who runs it?\\
353 - Oh, you're looking\\
354 - for the man that runs the gas
station.\\
355 - Yes, sir.\\
356 - Fill 'er up?\\
357 - Oh, you run the gas station, too, eh?\\
358 - Well, we're out of gas.\\
359 - Too bad, so am I.\\
360 - What?\\
361 - Yep, won't get any\\
362 - till 6:00 tomorrow morning.\\
363 - Oh... well, I guess\\
364 - we'll just have to spend the night
here.\\
365 - Yep.\\
366 - Sign the register.\\
367 - "Mister and Missus...\\
368 - "Ricky...\\
369 - "Ri... Ri...\\
370 - Ricardo."\\
371 - Pardon me, please.\\
372 - "Miss... Lucille MacGillicuddy."\\
373 - Good girl.\\
374 - You cad!\\
375 - That'll be two rooms--\\
376 - 102, 312.\\
377 - Oh, what's the difference?\\
378 - Two floors-- that's the difference.\\
379 - I'll send a boy out for your luggage.\\
380 - Oh, well, this is all the luggage
that we have.\\
381 - Oh, well, in that case\\
382 - it'll be $4.00 in advance.\\
383 - Each, that is.\\
384 - You took my wallet.\\
385 - I don't have any money.\\
386 - That's too bad.\\
387 - Would you show me to my room, please?\\
388 - What do you mean, "That's too bad"?\\
389 - Give the man the money, will you?\\
390 - Why should I pay for your room?\\
391 - We're not married.\\
392 - Yeah, why should she?\\
393 - Now, look, honey, let me explain.\\
394 - Let me explain the whole thing to
you, will you, please?\\
395 - The whole thing is a gag, honey.\\
396 - Now I'll tell you what happened.
Look...\\
397 - You know, Fred Mertz had a friend.\\
398 - He had a friend down at the License
Bureau, see?\\
399 - So I asked him to tell his friend to
tell you\\
400 - when you got down there\\
401 - that the license was no good\\
402 - and that we were not married at all.\\
403 - That's what I told him\\
404 - and he did it, you know?\\
405 - Isn't that funny?\\
406 - That's the phoniest story I've ever
heard.\\
407 - That's the phoniest story I have ever
heard\\
408 - and I've heard them all.\\
409 - Now, Lucy, for goodness' sake...\\
410 - Uh-uh.\\
411 - Please, stop annoying our paying
guest.\\
412 - I'll have a bell boy take you\\
413 - right up to your room, young lady.\\
414 - Thank you.\\
415 - Front!\\
416 - Oh, are you the bell boy, too?\\
417 - Why, sure.\\
418 - Call for Philip...\\
419 - Gosh, I've heard that a thousand
times\\
420 - but I just can't remember what that
fellow's last name is.\\
421 - Follow me.\\
422 - What happened? What? What?\\
423 - Good morning.\\
424 - Good morning.\\
425 - Well, she's all filled with gasoline
and raring to go.\\
426 - Good. Let's get out of here.\\
427 - Gee, we're just in time to go to New
York\\
428 - in time for rehearsal.
Let's go.\\
429 - Just a minute.\\
430 - That gasoline came to $3.25.\\
431 - Well?\\
432 - Well?\\
433 - Well, give him the money.\\
434 - You certainly don't expect me\\
435 - to pay for the gas, do you?\\
436 - Well, you better give the man the
money\\
437 - or neither one of us is going to get
back in town.\\
438 - Well, it doesn't matter to me.\\
439 - I have no pressing engagements.\\
440 - But, honey, I have...\\
441 - I'm the sheriff.\\
442 - I just had a call from the gas
station.\\
443 - Which one of you is the deadbeat?\\
444 - He's your man, Officer.\\
445 - All righty.\\
446 - Well, I guess you're going to jail.\\
447 - Jail?!\\
448 - Yep.\\
449 - Wait a minute.\\
450 - Un momento, caballero.\\
451 - Me deje explicar.\\
452 - Estamos casado hace diez anos.\\
453 - Ella esta completamente loca.\\
454 - Me quiere poner en la carcel.\\
455 - Aha! A spy!\\
456 - A spy?!\\
457 - Just a minute.\\
458 - Just a minute, Mr. Willoughby.\\
459 - Uh, he isn't a spy.\\
460 - Well, you don't kid me.\\
461 - I know Russian when I hear it.\\
462 - Well, that wasn't Russian, that was
Spanish.\\
463 - Spanish? Well, we licked them in '98\\
464 - and by golly, we can do it again.\\
465 - Come on.\\
466 - Look, you better give this character
his money\\
467 - or he's going to have me shot.\\
468 - Why should I care what happens to you\\
469 - when you don't care enough about me
to marry me?\\
470 - Yeah.\\
471 - Say, why don't you marry that little
lady?\\
472 - Well, I would marry her\\
473 - but she wouldn't marry me.\\
474 - No?
No.\\
475 - Anyway, I don't even have money\\
476 - to pay the justice of the peace.\\
477 - Well, maybe if you talk right nice
like\\
478 - the justice of the peace might do it
for nothing.\\
479 - Yeah? Well, you know where I can find
him?\\
480 - Where's the happy couple?\\
481 - You know, the real money in this town
is selling hats.\\
482 - Look, Mr. Willoughby, can we rush
this thing?\\
483 - I'm in a terrible hurry to get back
into town.\\
484 - Young man, this is serious business.\\
485 - You just can't rush into marriage,
you know.\\
486 - Now, let's see...
we need a witness.\\
487 - Mother!\\
488 - Yes?\\
489 - That's Mrs. Willoughby.\\
490 - I call her "Mother."\\
491 - Look, can we get started now, please?\\
492 - I'm in a terrible rush.\\
493 - Look, I'm not going to marry you\\
494 - until you propose.\\
495 - In front of Mr. Willoughby?\\
496 - Oh, go on, please.\\
497 - Go ahead, Ricky.\\
498 - All right.\\
499 - Lucy...\\
500 - Down on your knee.\\
501 - Lucy, will you...\\
502 - Oh, wait!
Wait just a minute.\\
503 - I want Mother to see this.\\
504 - Mother!\\
505 - Hurry up, please.\\
506 - Goodness!\\
507 - Well, don't hurry me.\\
508 - I want you to hear this.\\
509 - This young gentleman here\\
510 - is just about to pop the question to
the lady.\\
511 - Oh...\\
512 - All right, Ricky, start popping.\\
513 - Lucy...\\
514 - Lucy, I...\\
515 - Lucy, I think you're\\
516 - the most wonderful girl in the world.\\
517 - I can't live without you.
Lucy, will you marry me?\\
518 - Yes, I will.\\
519 - How sweet!\\
520 - All right.\\
521 - Now, can we get going now, please?\\
522 - All righty.\\
523 - Now, Mother, take your place.\\
524 - Now, you two just get right...
No, you're on the other side.\\
525 - Mother, please!\\
526 - Well, I don't know where...\\
527 - For all the times you've done this...\\
528 - For goodness' sake, now, stand still,
will you?\\
529 - All right.\\
530 - Oh, I just had a terrible thought.\\
531 - We can't get married.\\
532 - We don't have a license.\\
533 - Oh, don't worry about that.\\
534 - I know.\\
535 - You're the head of the License
Bureau.\\
536 - Oh, no, I'm not, smarty.\\
537 - I am.\\
538 - Mrs. Willoughby\\
539 - would you make the license out right
away?\\
540 - And I'll be right back.\\
541 - Lucy, where are you going?\\
542 - You'll see.\\
543 - I want everything to be just the way
it was before.\\
544 - Come on, honey, aren't you ready yet?\\
545 - Come on, Lucy.\\
546 - Lucy, you look so beautiful.\\
547 - Will you marry me?\\
548 - Yes.\\
549 - Well, I guess we're all set.\\
550 - You're on the wrong side.\\
551 - Oh.\\
552 - We have a beautiful ceremony, we do.\\
553 - We start with a song.\\
554 - Hit it, Mother.\\
555 - I... I love you truly, truly, dear\\
556 - Life with its sorrows, life with its
tear\\
557 - Fades into dreams when I feel you are
near\\
558 - For I love you truly, truly, dear\\
559 - Thank you, Mrs. Willoughby.\\
560 - Very nice, very nice.\\
561 - Ah, love, 'tis something to feel your
kind hand\\
562 - Ah, yes, 'tis something...\\
563 - Mother.\\
564 - Beside you to stand...\\
565 - Mother.\\
566 - Gone are the dreams...\\
567 - Mother!\\
568 - That's all, Mother.\\
569 - Don't I even get to sing the second
verse?\\
570 - No.\\
571 - Oh, nuts!\\
572 - There's your certificate.\\
573 - Now you're all legally married.\\
574 - Thank you, Mrs. Willoughby.\\
575 - Thank you.
Good-bye.\\
576 - Wait, wait, wait!
I forgot something.\\
577 - Whee!\\
578 - Oh!\\
579 - Oh, thank you, thank you.\\
580 - Thank you.\\
581 - Not so fast.\\
582 - Do you own that car parked out there
at the curb?\\
583 - You know I do-- you just filled it up
with gas\\
584 - a couple of hours ago.\\
585 - Do you realize that you've parked 12
hours\\
586 - in a one-hour zone?\\
587 - Ten dollars or ten days.\\
588 - But we just gave you all the money we
had\\
589 - to pay for the gas.\\
590 - Ten dollars or ten days.\\
591 - Just a minute, Burt.\\
592 - You young folks just run right along\\
593 - and forget what he said.\\
594 - Mother, please!\\
595 - Are you forgetting you're talking to
the sheriff?\\
596 - Father, you're forgetting I'm the
mayor.
 
\subsection {Episode 27: The Kleptomaniac (1952)}
1 - Hi, Lucy, I came up to give you
some...\\
2 - What was that?\\
3 - It was on the ceiling.\\
4 - I'm trying to learn\\
5 - to flip pancakes up in the air\\
6 - like they do in restaurants.\\
7 - Oh.\\
8 - I came up to give you this money.\\
9 - Boy, am I glad to get it off my
hands.\\
10 - What is all that?\\
11 - What are you trying to do-- bribe me?\\
12 - The club treasurer asked me\\
13 - to give it to you.\\
14 - Oh, for the bazaar.\\
15 - Yeah. You're supposed to use it\\
16 - to rent the hall and buy the
refreshments\\
17 - have the posters printed...\\
18 - Shh!\\
19 - What's the matter?\\
20 - I don't want Ricky to hear.\\
21 - Lucy\\
22 - haven't you told him you're chairman
of the bazaar?\\
23 - No, and I'm not going to tell him
till next Friday.\\
24 - But the bazaar's next Thursday.\\
25 - Exactly.\\
26 - You sure live dangerously, Lucy.\\
27 - Well, after what happened\\
28 - at the Fourth of July carnival last
year\\
29 - Ricky made me promise\\
30 - that I wouldn't get mixed up\\
31 - in any more club affairs.\\
32 - I don't blame him.\\
33 - You weren't very bright\\
34 - throwing all those skyrockets\\
35 - and Roman candles in a fireplace.\\
36 - Well, who uses a fireplace in July?\\
37 - He should have looked\\
38 - before he threw that match in there.\\
39 - Poor Ricky.\\
40 - His eyebrows didn't grow in for a
month.\\
41 - You remember those little baby
toupees he wore over each eye?\\
42 - Say, where are you hiding all the
stuff\\
43 - that's been donated to the bazaar
auction?\\
44 - I'll show you.\\
45 - What a treasure trove!\\
46 - Shh!\\
47 - Say, when we sell that\\
48 - the club will have nothing but money.\\
49 - And I've got a slew of stuff to
collect.\\
50 - I'm going out as soon as Ricky
leaves.\\
51 - Lucy!\\
52 - Yeah, dear?\\
53 - Ready yet?
Okay, yeah.\\
54 - I got to run along.\\
55 - So long.\\
56 - Bye-bye.\\
57 - Hey! Not a word to Ricky.\\
58 - Don't worry.\\
59 - Okay.\\
60 - Good morning, honey.\\
61 - Good morning, dear.\\
62 - Hey!\\
63 - Tortillas.\\
64 - Yeah.\\
65 - I made them\\
66 - out of Aunt Jemima tortilla mix.\\
67 - Oh, I keep forgetting here in America\\
68 - you call them flapcakes.\\
69 - Come again?\\
70 - Hot jacks?\\
71 - You were closer with tortillas.\\
72 - They are hot cakes.\\
73 - Oh.\\
74 - Not these.\\
75 - These are cold cakes.\\
76 - Oh, honey, I'm sorry.\\
77 - I'll make you some hot ones.\\
78 - No, honey, it'll take too long.\\
79 - I'll just have some coffee.
I'm in a hurry.\\
80 - Well, I'll make some for myself.\\
81 - Listen, you got any money?\\
82 - I haven't got any money for cab fare.\\
83 - I don't know. There's my bag over
there on the shelf.\\
84 - Thanks.\\
85 - Oh, honey, I just remembered--\\
86 - no, I don't have any money.\\
87 - I don't have a cent in there, honey.\\
88 - Give me my bag.\\
89 - Wait a... wait...\\
90 - I don't have a cent.\\
91 - Wait a minute.\\
92 - What are you getting so excited
about?\\
93 - Let's see what's in here.\\
94 - Wow.\\
95 - What is this?\\
96 - Uh...
it's my mad money.\\
97 - 150... 160...
170... $200 here.\\
98 - Yeah, I get awful mad.\\
99 - Lucy.\\
100 - Where did you get this money?\\
101 - Uh... I saved it out of my allowance?\\
102 - No?\\
103 - No.\\
104 - Uh...\\
105 - No.\\
106 - Ew...\\
107 - Now, Lucy, this is no joke.\\
108 - There's a lot of money here.\\
109 - I want to know where you got it.\\
110 - Ricky, you said you were late for
work.\\
111 - Now, Lucy, I want to know where you
got that money.\\
112 - Did you earn it?\\
113 - Did you borrow it?\\
114 - Did you steal it?\\
115 - Yeah, that's it.\\
116 - Which one?\\
117 - Oh, it doesn't matter-- any one of
them.\\
118 - Now, Lucy.\\
119 - All right.\\
120 - You'll find out sooner or later
anyway.\\
121 - I stole it.\\
122 - What?\\
123 - Well, I'm sorry-- I saw it\\
124 - and I just couldn't help myself.\\
125 - Now, Lucy, you're not telling me the
truth.\\
126 - Yes, I am.\\
127 - Word of honor?\\
128 - Well... what good's a crook's word of
honor?\\
129 - Look, I haven't got time for jokes
right now\\
130 - but by the time that I come home this
afternoon\\
131 - you better have an explanation\\
132 - of how you got that money,
understand?\\
133 - Yes, sir.\\
134 - All right.\\
135 - I'll take the subway.\\
136 - Lucy?\\
137 - Lucy?\\
138 - Ricky?\\
139 - Lucy?\\
140 - Yeah?
Oh, there you are.\\
141 - How did everything go today?\\
142 - Oh, just wonderful.
I got some wonderful stuff.\\
143 - That's great.\\
144 - But listen, Ethel\\
145 - Ricky found that bazaar money\\
146 - in my bag this morning.\\
147 - He did?
How did you explain it?\\
148 - Oh, I didn't.\\
149 - I tried to gag my way out by saying I
stole it.\\
150 - Stole it?!\\
151 - Yeah, well, he didn't believe me.\\
152 - Listen, Ethel, can I tell him that it
belongs to you?\\
153 - Huh?\\
154 - Can I tell him the money is yours?\\
155 - Well, if you'll do me a favor.\\
156 - What?\\
157 - Do you think you could auction off\\
158 - that hideous cuckoo clock\\
159 - that Fred won at Coney Island?\\
160 - Well, sure, but Fred would never
donate that.\\
161 - But I've got a scheme.\\
162 - I bought a little clock to donate\\
163 - and I'm going to tell you to go
downstairs and get it.\\
164 - It's on a table next to the cuckoo
clock\\
165 - and you take the cuckoo clock by
mistake, see?\\
166 - After it's auctioned off\\
167 - what can he do about it?\\
168 - Ethel, how could ever think up a
sneaky scheme like that?\\
169 - Who do you think you are-- me?\\
170 - I'll do it.\\
171 - Fred?\\
172 - Yeah.\\
173 - Where are you?\\
174 - Right here.\\
175 - I'm trying to fix the leg on this
darn couch.\\
176 - It keeps coming off all the time.\\
177 - You want to give me a hand?\\
178 - Listen, Fred, I got an awful problem
on my hands.\\
179 - You should have thought of that\\
180 - before you married her.\\
181 - Look, this is no joke.\\
182 - This morning I found\\
183 - a roll of bills in Lucy's purse--
$200.\\
184 - And just now I saw her sneaking in
the house\\
185 - carrying some big silver things--\\
186 - real expensive-looking stuff.\\
187 - Well, there must be some explanation.\\
188 - I don't think so.\\
189 - She hid them in the closet.\\
190 - You know, there must be\\
191 - thousands of dollars worth of stuff
in that closet\\
192 - that doesn't belong to us.\\
193 - Gee whiz, you don't suppose\\
194 - she's a kleptomaniac?\\
195 - Oh, no, I just think she steals
things.\\
196 - Yeah, that's what a kleptomaniac is--\\
197 - a person who steal things and can't
help it.\\
198 - It's a kind of a disease.\\
199 - Oh, gee.\\
200 - Oh, you must be mistaken.\\
201 - Come on, help me with this, will you?\\
202 - Okay.\\
203 - My God.\\
204 - Fred, are you home?\\
205 - Fred?\\
206 - Oh, Fred.\\
207 - You see!\\
208 - If I hadn't see it with my own eyes\\
209 - I'd never believe it.\\
210 - How do you like that?\\
211 - She is a klep...
klep... klep...\\
212 - what you said.\\
213 - Oh, this is terrible.\\
214 - I'm married to a thief.\\
215 - Now, listen, Rick, if she is a
kleptomaniac\\
216 - it isn't her fault.\\
217 - She doesn't know what she's doing.\\
218 - She's just a poor, sick person\\
219 - and we shouldn't blame her for...\\
220 - hey, that dirty crook stole my clock!\\
221 - What am I going to do?\\
222 - Well, I don't know about you\\
223 - but I'm going to get my cuckoo clock.\\
224 - Come on, let's sneak up the back way.\\
225 - Okay.\\
226 - Come on.\\
227 - Hi, fellas.\\
228 - Hi, Lucy.\\
229 - Hi, Lucy.\\
230 - What's new?\\
231 - Nothing.\\
232 - If you'll excuse me\\
233 - I got to go in the bedroom.\\
234 - Lucy?\\
235 - Lucy, I want to talk\\
236 - to you about something, honey.\\
237 - Won't you sit down?\\
238 - Oh, I'd rather not.\\
239 - I...\\
240 - Don't you...\\
241 - don't you have anything\\
242 - to tell me?\\
243 - No.\\
244 - Aren't you hiding something\\
245 - under your coat?\\
246 - No, no, that's all me.\\
247 - Too much pie and cake lately, I
guess.\\
248 - Are you sure?\\
249 - Yeah, I'm sure.\\
250 - What was that?\\
251 - Yeah.\\
252 - Oh, I did it.\\
253 - Uh... Cuckoo, cuckoo.\\
254 - I'm learning to do bird calls.\\
255 - It didn't sound like you.\\
256 - Well, it was.\\
257 - I'm... Cuckoo.\\
258 - I'm... I do...\\
259 - ...several kinds of bird calls.\\
260 - Uh... Cuckoo\\
261 - Bird calls?\\
262 - Yeah.\\
263 - What was that?\\
264 - That was a South African
Yellow-Bellied Sapsucker.\\
265 - Cuckoo.\\
266 - Cuckoo.\\
267 - Do you know any more bird calls?\\
268 - Um...\\
269 - What was that?\\
270 - A hummingbird.\\
271 - Cuckoo.\\
272 - Cuckoo.\\
273 - You do that cuckoo a lot, don't you?\\
274 - Well, that's my best one.\\
275 - Cuckoo.\\
276 - Um... I do the English sparrow.\\
277 - Cuckoo.\\
278 - Cuckoo.\\
279 - It's part sparrow and part cuckoo.\\
280 - I know someone who's all cuckoo.\\
281 - I'll see you later, fellas.\\
282 - I want my cuckoo clock.\\
283 - Wait, Fred, please.\\
284 - You'll get your cuckoo clock back
later.\\
285 - The most important thing right now is
Lucy.\\
286 - Now, come on. Let's go down to your
place.\\
287 - What are you going to do?\\
288 - There's only one thing to do.\\
289 - I'm going to call a "pysaciatrist."\\
290 - What?\\
291 - A "pysaciatrist."\\
292 - I'm going to call a head doctor.\\
293 - I think\\
294 - you should.\\
295 - Come on, will you?\\
296 - Lucy?\\
297 - What?\\
298 - The most awful thing happened.\\
299 - Fred and Ricky saw you take the
cuckoo clock.\\
300 - They couldn't have.
There was nobody there.\\
301 - Yes, there was.\\
302 - They were behind the sofa fixing
something.\\
303 - Oh, so that's why they were asking me
all those questions.\\
304 - And that's not all.\\
305 - Ricky was hiding in the kitchen\\
306 - and saw you putting all that stuff in
the closet.\\
307 - Oh, and that money this morning.\\
308 - What must he think?\\
309 - He thinks you're a kleptomaniac.\\
310 - What?\\
311 - A kleptomaniac.\\
312 - He came down to our apartment\\
313 - and called a psychiatrist.\\
314 - I heard him.\\
315 - He told him all about it.\\
316 - He's bringing him home with him
tonight.\\
317 - Oh, he is, is he?\\
318 - A fine, trusting husband to have.\\
319 - Well, I'll show him.\\
320 - Now, wait a minute, Lucy.\\
321 - After all\\
322 - Ricky actually saw you taking things.\\
323 - Sure I've been taking things\\
324 - but he thinks I've been taking
things.\\
325 - Oh.\\
326 - Why don't you tell him\\
327 - about the bazaar?\\
328 - What, and admit that I'm a liar?\\
329 - Oh, no.\\
330 - If he wants a wife who's a thief\\
331 - I'll give him a wife who's a thief.\\
332 - Lucy, what are you hatching?\\
333 - When Ricky and that psychiatrist\\
334 - come home tonight\\
335 - we are going to be playing a little
play\\
336 - starring Lucy the Lip and Babyface
Ethel.\\
337 - Oh, no.\\
338 - You're not going to get me in on
this.\\
339 - Listen to me, Babyface.\\
340 - Now, you help me pull this job or
I'll squeal\\
341 - that you were the brains in the
cuckoo clock caper.\\
342 - Okay, you got me.\\
343 - What's the deal?\\
344 - Come in, doctor.\\
345 - Oh, remember, Ricky, not doctor.\\
346 - Oh, that's right... Tom.\\
347 - Lucy, where are you?\\
348 - Oh, give me your coat.\\
349 - Oh, thank you.\\
350 - Sit down, won't you?\\
351 - Oh, yes, yes, of course.\\
352 - Lucy?\\
353 - I wonder where she could be.\\
354 - Well, I...\\
355 - Hi, Rick, you seen Ethel?\\
356 - No.\\
357 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
358 - I didn't know you had company.\\
359 - Oh, that's all right.\\
360 - This is a very good friend of mine\\
361 - Dr. Robinson, the "pysaciatrist."\\
362 - This our landlord, Mr. Mertz.\\
363 - How do you do, Mr. Mertz?\\
364 - How are you, doctor?\\
365 - Very well, thank you.\\
366 - Listen, don't call him doctor in
front of Lucy.\\
367 - We want her to think that he's just a
friend.\\
368 - Oh.\\
369 - Have you seen Lucy?\\
370 - She's probably with Ethel.\\
371 - Maybe they're out shopping.\\
372 - Yeah...
or shoplifting.\\
373 - Well, I hope they'll be home soon.\\
374 - Would you like a cigarette, doc?\\
375 - Oh, yes, thank you.\\
376 - Well, this is the first time I ever
smoked one of these.\\
377 - Gee.\\
378 - Fred, look at all these jewels.\\
379 - Sticky fingers strikes again.\\
380 - Wait a minute-- what's the matter
with this chair?\\
381 - Look at this.\\
382 - A blowtorch.\\
383 - A crowball...
a crowbar.\\
384 - Flash.\\
385 - This is terrible.\\
386 - Let me see what this is.\\
387 - What is it?\\
388 - Oh, no.\\
389 - It's the floor plan of the Chase
National Bank.\\
390 - The 72nd street branch.\\
391 - Why, that's where I keep my money.\\
392 - This is serious.\\
393 - Oh, I hope I'm not too late to help
her.\\
394 - What's going...\\
395 - Okay.\\
396 - Okay?\\
397 - Okay.\\
398 - Did you get any of them?\\

shall we?\\
472 - Now, Mrs. Ricardo\\
473 - why don't you tell me\\
474 - how you got started\\
475 - in this life of crime?\\
476 - Go back.\\
477 - Go back into your childhood.\\
478 - Go back.\\
479 - Back.\\
480 - Back.\\
481 - Well, it all started
when I was a little girl.\\
482 - I was riding on the streetcar one day\\
483 - and I looked up and I saw a box and
it said, "take one."\\
484 - So I took one.\\
485 - There was nothing wrong with that.\\
486 - Oh, yes, there was.\\
487 - From then on, I took anything that
came into my pretty head\\
488 - even though it didn't say, "take
one."\\
489 - I took a bright, new penny.\\
490 - I took a bicycle.\\
491 - I took a little boy.\\
492 - You took a little boy?\\
493 - Yeah.\\
494 - But my mother made me give him back.\\
495 - And then...
then you grew up.\\
496 - Yeah.\\
497 - Yeah.\\
498 - Yeah.\\
499 - Yeah, and I began picking pockets.\\
500 - I picked a peck of pockets.\\
501 - Pretty soon I graduated to purse
snatching.\\
502 - Would you like to see my collection?\\
503 - Well, uh... I don't believe I have
time.\\
504 - Where's my watch?\\
505 - Right here, sonny.\\
506 - Come on, dead end.\\
507 - Okay, brains.\\
508 - Oh, Ricky, this is much more serious
than I realized.\\
509 - Oh, do you think there's any hope?\\
510 - Do you think you can do something?\\
511 - I don't know.\\
512 - Hey! That's a lot of purses!\\
513 - I got purses here\\
514 - I ain't never opened yet.\\
515 - Get a load of this loot, sonny.\\
516 - Get a load of that, will you?\\
517 - Boy, I been snatching purses\\
518 - for nigh unto 12 years.\\
519 - Whoa, boy!\\
520 - I grabbed this one quicker than I
thought.\\
521 - I remember now--\\
522 - snatched this off a dummy in a store
window.\\
523 - Mrs. Ricardo.\\
524 - Yeah?\\
525 - I'm not just a friend of your
husband's.\\
526 - No?\\
527 - No, I'm a doctor, a psychiatrist.\\
528 - Now, if you'll undergo treatment with
me\\
529 - I think I can cure you of all this.\\
530 - Well... I think I'm cured completely.\\
531 - I don't think I'll ever steal
anything\\
532 - as long as I live.\\
533 - Oh, why?\\
534 - Well, what is there left?\\
535 - This morning I achieved my highest
desire--\\
536 - a kleptomaniac's dream.\\
537 - What do you mean, Mrs. Ricardo?\\
538 - Well, I...
sandpapered my fingertips\\
539 - put on my big coat with the big,
secret pocket\\
540 - went down to Clyde Beatty's circus.\\
541 - Down to Clyde Beatty's circus...\\
542 - What could she possibly get at the
Clyde Beatty circus?\\
543 - Oh!

Renita, was a child\\
269 - she and Ricky used to dance together.\\
270 - She was much younger than he was.\\
271 - Yeah, what happened?\\
272 - Well somehow she caught up with him.\\
273 - So?\\

275 - and they want Ricky to dance with her
tonight.\\
276 - So?\\

279 - I'd just like to get a load\\
280 - of that dance they're doing, that's
all.\\
281 - Then why don't you go to rehearsal.\\
282 - Oh, I can't do that.\\
283 - I'm not going down there and have
Ricky think\\
284 - that I'm jealous and spying on him.\\
285 - Well, I could go watch and then
report to you.\\
286 - Oh, no you couldn't.\\
287 - I could go.\\
288 - No, that's no good.\\
289 - Well, you know in the afternoon down

scrubwomen hanging around.\\
291 - Scrubwomen?\\

congestion\\

404 - The cab will be right over.\\
405 - Thank you.\\
406 - Did you call a cab, lady?\\
407 - Well, yes, I did.\\
408 - I'd have been here sooner\\
409 - only, but, uh, traffic was agin' me.\\
410 - Good-bye, Mrs. Mertz.\\
411 - Now, Cabbie, I want you to take\\
412 - very good care of this little lady.\\
413 - I want you to take her to the
Tropicana Club.\\
414 - Don't you worry, lady.\\
415 - I know a short cut through
Piladelpia.\\
416 - Adios, Lucy.\\
417 - Adios.\\
418 - Good-bye, lady.\\
419 - Adios.\\
420 - Lucy...\\
421 - Bueno, muy bueno.\\
422 - Magnifico, isn't that right?\\
423 - Thank you.\\
424 - Thank you very much, Carlos and
Maria,\\
425 - and thank you, ladies and gentlemen.\\
426 - I'm indeed very happy that you like
those wonderful people\\
427 - because they were the ones\\
428 - that gave me my start in show
business.\\
429 - And now for the highlight of the
evening,\\
430 - I'd like to introduce to you Ramon
and Renita\\
431 - doing their version of the African
wedding dance.\\
432 - So now we take you to...\\
433 - Africa.\\
434 - Just me.\\
435 - I only want to get you into the mood.\\
436 - You know, on the night of the full
Moon,\\
437 - the high priest goes to a jungle
clearing\\
438 - and sings a song of love\\
439 - and then follows the courtship dance\\
440 - in which the bridegroom tries to
impress his bride-to-be\\
441 - with his fierceness and strength.\\
442 - So now let's pretend that this is a
jungle clearing,\\
443 - there is a full Moon,\\
444 - and the high priest is singing his
song.\\
445 - Spirit in the wood, beat the hollow
cane\\
446 - Spirit in the wood, float away the
pain\\
447 - Make their bodies ripe and alive
again\\
448 - I sing me-lo\\
449 - I sing me-lo\\
450 - I sing me-lo\\
451 - Spirit in the heart, make the blood
flow fast\\
452 - Spirit in the heart, make the muscle
last\\
453 - Keep the hope alive while their youth
will pass\\
454 - I sing me-lo\\
455 - I sing me-lo\\
456 - I sing me-lo\\
457 - When the woman come upon the scene\\
458 - Drop a petal from a tree\\
459 - Veil the mountain up into the skies\\
460 - Spill the river in the sea.\\
461 - Spirit in the wood\\
462 - Let the hollow cane echo in the
afterglow\\
463 - Waiting for the flame to burn again\\
464 - I sing me-lo\\
465 - I sing me-lo\\
466 - I sing me-lo\\
467 - I sing me-lo\\
468 - I sing me-lo\\
469 - I...\\
470 - Sing me-lo.

\subsection {Episode 29: The Freezer (1952)}
1 - Here you are, dear.\\
2 - Oh, thank you, honey.\\
3 - Hey, what goes here?\\
4 - Just two eggs?
Where's the bacon?\\
5 - Bacon happens to be 75 cents a pound.\\
6 - Look, Lucy, I can't eat eggs that
way.\\
7 - They-they-they look absolutely naked.\\
8 - Well, look the other way when you eat
them.\\
9 - Now, Lucy, where's the bacon?\\
10 - As far as I'm concerned, it's still
on the hog.\\
11 - I'm economizing.\\
12 - Well, look, honey, that's a very good
attitude,\\
13 - but why do you have to cut down on
food?\\
14 - There's just no other place to cut
down.\\
15 - Is that so, eh?\\
16 - What about all the money that you
spend on clothes\\
17 - and the beauty parlor, hmm?\\
18 - Why don't you cut them out?\\
19 - Well, all right, if you think you'd
like your meals served\\
20 - by an ugly brunette wearing a flour
sack.\\
21 - You know what I mean.\\
22 - This must be some other way to
economize.\\
23 - Well, as a matter of fact there is,
Ricky.\\
24 - Look, "Save money with a home
freezer.\\
25 - Get your meat wholesale."\\
26 - I knew it! I knew it had to be
something\\
27 - in back of all this.\\
28 - But it won't cost us a cent, Ricky.\\
29 - Look, it says right here:\\
30 - "This freezer pays for itself."\\
31 - Oh, well, let me see.\\
32 - Hey, maybe we ought to get one.\\
33 - Really?\\
34 - Sure.\\
35 - As soon as it gets through paying for
itself,\\
36 - tell it to give us a call and come
over.\\
37 - Now, you know what I meant.\\
38 - Honey, I can't afford a freezer,\\
39 - not even one that pays for itself.\\
40 - But Ricky, listen, it's only going to
save us money...\\
41 - I cannot do it, honey, no.\\
42 - Can't afford it.\\
43 - See you later.\\
44 - What about your eggs?\\
45 - Oh, I got a feeling\\
46 - that they won't go to waste.\\
47 - Ethel is coming up, isn't she?\\
48 - Good-bye.\\
49 - Good-bye.\\
50 - Good morning, Lucy.\\
51 - Oh, yeah?\\
52 - Good-bye, Lucy.\\
53 - Come back, Ethel.\\
54 - If I'd wanted to be with somebody
grumpy\\
55 - I'd have stayed downstairs with Fred.\\
56 - What's the matter with you?\\
57 - Oh, I asked Ricky\\
58 - if we couldn't have this freezer,\\
59 - and he says he can't afford it.\\
60 - Can't afford it.\\
61 - I asked Fred to buy us a freezer,
too.\\
62 - What did he say?\\
63 - I'll tell you what I said.\\
64 - Please, please, there are ladies
present.\\
65 - I just come up to tell you not to
expect any heat today.\\
66 - I put all new firebrick in that
furnace\\
67 - and we can't use it till the cement
dries.\\
68 - This house might be a home freezer
itself by night.\\
69 - Charm boy.\\
70 - Yeah.\\
71 - Gee, why is it everything that's
wonderful costs money?\\
72 - I don't know.\\
73 - Say, why didn't I think of this
before?\\
74 - Uncle Oscar!\\
75 - Uncle Oscar?\\
76 - My Uncle Oscar is a butcher,\\
77 - and he's got a big cold chest.\\
78 - Why don't you knit him a sweater?\\
79 - Well, of course, if you don't want to
hear my plan...\\
80 - I do, I do.\\
81 - Well, he's retiring from the meat
business,\\
82 - and he's got a great big old
freezer--\\
83 - you know, the kind you walk into and
hang up the meat.\\
84 - I'll bet he'd sell us that for
practically nothing.\\
85 - Really?
I'm going to call him up.\\
86 - If we could buy it and put it in the
basement,\\
87 - we'd have a real home freezer.\\
88 - How much do you think he'd sell it
for?\\
89 - I don't know, but there's no harm in
asking him,\\
90 - 'cause this would be a great way...\\
91 - Hello, Uncle Oscar?\\
92 - This is little Ethel.\\
93 - Little?\\
94 - Uncle Oscar, how much do you want\\
95 - for that big old freezer of yours?\\
96 - For me.\\
97 - Well, that sounds like a fair price.\\
98 - How much?\\
99 - He'll sell it to us for nothing.\\
100 - For nothing!\\
101 - All we have to do is pay\\
102 - for the hauling and installation?\\
103 - How much is that?\\
104 - How much is that?\\
105 - $50.\\
106 - Sold!\\
107 - We'll take it!\\
108 - When can we have it installed?\\
109 - This afternoon?\\
110 - Oh, gee, that's fine.\\
111 - Kiss Aunt Emmy for me, will you?\\
112 - Good-bye, unc.\\
113 - Lucy, we now own a home freezer.\\
114 - Thank you.\\
115 - Let's get busy!\\
116 - Look out!\\
117 - What are you doing?\\
118 - Ordering meat.\\
119 - The sooner we get the meat in the
freezer,\\
120 - the quicker we'll be saving money.\\
121 - I wonder how much we ought to order?\\
122 - Oh, 20, 25 Pounds, maybe 30.\\
123 - Gee, that sounds like a lot of meat.\\
124 - Honey! It'll last!\\
125 - Hello?\\
126 - Hello, this is Mrs. Ricky Ricardo\\
127 - at 623 East 68th Street.\\
128 - I'd like to order some meat for our
freezer.\\
129 - Beef.\\
130 - Oh, I see.\\
131 - Just a minute.\\
132 - It's only 69 cents a pound!\\
133 - No kidding?\\
134 - Why, steak's $1.89.\\
135 - I know, I'd better order right away\\
136 - before he realizes what a bargain
he's giving us.\\
137 - Uh, all right, that'll be fine.\\
138 - Oh, by the side?\\
139 - Oh, well, just a minute.\\
140 - That's the price by the side.\\
141 - How big is a side of beef?\\
142 - Well, a side of bacon is about this
big.\\
143 - Oh, well, that's okay.\\
144 - All right, I'll take a side.\\
145 - Better make it two sides.\\
146 - One for each of us.\\
147 - Yeah, can you send it over this
afternoon?\\
148 - East 68th Street.\\
149 - That's right, thank you.\\
150 - In the meantime, we'll go downtown.\\
151 - What for?\\
152 - Well, with all that money we're
saving on the freezer,\\
153 - we can afford to buy ourselves new
dresses.\\
154 - Hurry up! Get ready!\\
155 - Oh, yeah, it was a lot of money,\\
156 - but after all, it's a very basic
style.\\
157 - I can wear it for years.\\
158 - Oh, I can hardly wait to try these
things on!\\
159 - I'm going right down to my apartment
and put this on.\\
160 - Oh!\\
161 - Say, maybe that's the meat.\\
162 - Yes, sir?\\
163 - Mrs. Ricardo?\\
164 - Yes, sir?\\
165 - Johnson's Meat Company.\\
166 - Gee, that sure is a lot, isn't it?\\
167 - Oh, there's more.\\
168 - Oh?\\
169 - Look at the way they wrap it.\\
170 - Yeah.\\
171 - My goodness.\\
172 - Oh, hey, are you sure\\
173 - that's all for us?\\
174 - Lady, this is only the beginning.\\
175 - Oh, there must be a mistake.\\
176 - Oh, that isn't a side of beef.\\
177 - That must be a side of elephant.\\
178 - Lucy, what have we got ourselves
into?\\
179 - Well, what's all this going to cost,
Ethel?\\
180 - We're getting 700 pounds of meat!\\
181 - At 69 cents a pound, that's...\\
182 - $483.\\
183 - Listen, there's been a mistake.\\
184 - You're going to have to take most of
this meat back.\\
185 - All but 30 pounds.
Yeah.\\
186 - Sorry, ladies, once a side of beef
has been cut,\\
187 - we're not allowed to bring it back.\\
188 - Come on, Ethel, let's get busy.\\
189 - What are we going to do?\\
190 - I'm going to paste this animal back
together again.\\
191 - Find the piece that fits that.\\
192 - Look, ladies, even if you defrosted
it, pasted it together\\
193 - and taught it to walk, I couldn't
take it back!\\
194 - Well, that's one side.\\
195 - Now let's go down and get the other
one.\\
196 - The other one!\\
197 - Ricky and Fred are going to kill us!\\
198 - Yes, but by buying it all wholesale\\
199 - we saved them at least $500.\\
200 - I hope you can explain all that\\
201 - before their fingers tighten around
our throats.\\
202 - Maybe we could sell some of it!\\
203 - Sell it?\\
204 - Yeah, you know, we could go to a
butcher shop\\
205 - and grab some of the customers\\
206 - before the butcher gets to them.\\
207 - We could sell this for 79 cents a
pound.\\
208 - But it only cost 69.\\
209 - Well, we might as well make a little
something on it.\\
210 - Oh, no, Lucy, we couldn't sell it.\\
211 - It wouldn't be right.
It wouldn't be fair.\\
212 - Why not?\\
213 - It's...\\
214 - Well, don't just stand there!\\
215 - We got a lot of meat to sell!\\
216 - Get ready for business.\\
217 - Psst!\\
218 - Psst!\\
219 - Come here.\\
220 - Are you tired of paying high prices?\\
221 - Are you interested in a little
high-class beef?\\
222 - Do you want a bargain?\\
223 - Tell you what I'm gonna do.\\
224 - Step up a little closer\\
225 - I don't want to block the traffic.\\
226 - Now, you look like a smart dame.\\
227 - What'll it be?\\
228 - I got sirloin, tenderloin\\
229 - T-bone, rump, pot roast, chuck roast,
oxtail stump.\\
230 - I got a special on T-bone, 79 cents a
pound.\\
231 - Well, really, I'm...\\
232 - 79 cents!\\
233 - Shh! Quiet. Get 'em while they last,
lady.\\
234 - Step right over and help yourself.\\
235 - Ethel, help the little lady, will
you?\\
236 - What'll you have?\\
237 - Well, I'd like a sirloin.\\
238 - A sirloin coming up.\\
239 - Keep it down, keep it down, kid.\\
240 - How much does this weigh?\\
241 - Weigh.\\
242 - Three pounds.\\
243 - I'll take it.\\
244 - Psst!\\
245 - Come here.\\
246 - Are you interested in some high-class
beef?\\
247 - Are you tired of paying high prices?\\
248 - Do you want a bargain?\\
249 - Tell you what I'm gonna do.\\
250 - Is this choice meat?\\
251 - Absolutely-- give the little lady her
choice, Ethel.\\
252 - Tell you what I'm gonna do.\\
253 - That's not what I meant.\\
254 - Get away from me, kid, you bother me.\\
255 - Tell you what I'm gonna do:\\
256 - any cut you want, 79 cents a pound.\\
257 - But how can you afford to sell it so
cheap?\\
258 - I'm glad you asked that, lady.\\
259 - This is all made possible\\
260 - because we do everything ourselves.\\
261 - We rope, we brand, we butcher, we
market.\\
262 - We do everything but eat it for you.\\
263 - 79 cents a pound.\\
264 - Well, I'll try a round steak.\\
265 - Okay, step right over here.\\
266 - A round steak.\\
267 - Keep it down.\\
268 - Hey, hey...\\
269 - Rock-a-bye baby\\
270 - In the treetop\\
271 - Rock-a-bye baby in the treetop...\\
272 - Step right up.\\
273 - Every...\\
274 - Ohh!\\
275 - Amscray, amscray!
Utcherbay.\\
276 - Watch the papers for our new
location!\\
277 - Good afternoon.\\
278 - This is the last.\\
279 - Oh, thank goodness.\\
280 - Boy, 700 pounds of meat is a lot to
carry.\\
281 - Oh!\\
282 - You know...\\
283 - you know, what worries me is how
we're...\\
284 - Oh! Honey, I'm sor...\\
285 - Wait till I get the key.\\
286 - Gee, I'm sorry!\\
287 - Oh, boy, it gets cold in there in a
hurry!\\
288 - Yeah, how about that.\\
289 - You know, this is dangerous\\
290 - not being able to open that from the
inside.\\
291 - We'd better have this lock taken off
tomorrow.\\
292 - Yeah, that's a good idea.\\
293 - Golly.\\
294 - Well, Lucy, we did it.\\
295 - It's all in there.\\
296 - Yeah... now we just got to explain\\
297 - all this meat to Ricky and Fred.\\
298 - Yeah.\\
299 - You don't suppose they'd believe\\
300 - that a cow wandered in there and fell
apart?\\
301 - Nope.\\
302 - No, I guess not.\\
303 - What's that?\\
304 - It's Ricky and Fred.\\
305 - They're coming down here!\\
306 - Oh, no, they're up in the apartment.\\
307 - We're hearing them through the
furnace.\\
308 - Are you sure?\\
309 - Sure, I'll show you.\\
310 - Don't touch that, honey, it's hot!\\
311 - No, Fred's fixing it, remember?\\
312 - Oh.\\
313 - I wonder what Ricky's doing home
already.\\
314 - I'll see.\\
315 - Lucy, they're looking for us!\\
316 - What are we gonna tell them?\\
317 - Well, come on, we can't let them find
us down here.\\
318 - Hurry up!\\
319 - Well, Ethel, look who's here!\\
320 - Why, it's Ricky and Fred!\\
321 - Yeah.\\
322 - Girls, we want to talk to you.\\
323 - About what?\\
324 - I ran into Uncle Oscar today.\\
325 - Start packing, Ethel.\\
326 - Wait a minute, wait a minute.\\
327 - We're not mad at you.\\
328 - We think it's a wonderful idea\\
329 - that you got the freezer.\\
330 - Yeah, that was a real smart business
deal.\\
331 - Yeah, how about that?\\
332 - In fact, we think you did so well
getting the freezer\\
333 - that we want to do our share, too.\\
334 - That's right,\\
335 - and just to get you started,\\
336 - here's what we got.\\
337 - 30 pounds of meat.\\
338 - Gee, swell.\\
339 - Gee.\\
340 - You ever saw that much meat in your
whole life?\\
341 - No.\\
342 - Boy, that sure is a lot, isn't it,
Ethel?\\
343 - Well, come on, let's get it down to
the freezer.\\
344 - Yeah, let's put it in the freezer,
come on.\\
345 - No, no, wait a minute.\\
346 - I have a couple of steaks.\\
347 - I think we ought to do it all in one
trip.\\
348 - Come here and help me, Ethel.\\
349 - What's with her?\\
350 - Listen, you stall them while I get
that meat out of the freezer.\\
351 - How can I stall them?\\
352 - Listen, if I can move 700 pounds of
meat\\
353 - you ought to be able to keep two
husbands occupied\\
354 - for a couple of minutes.\\
355 - Well, what can I do?\\
356 - Dance with them, talk, sing.\\
357 - That's it, ask Ricky to sing.\\
358 - Sing?
You know he won't.\\
359 - Oh, won't he? Listen, you take care
of the ham.\\
360 - I'll take care of the beef.\\
361 - Hi, fellas.\\
362 - Hi. What's the delay?\\
363 - Delay?\\
364 - Where's Lucy?
Come on.\\
365 - Lucy?\\
366 - Um, uh... uh, she, uh...
she, uh...\\
367 - The freezer was dirty and she wanted
to go down\\
368 - and clean it all up before you saw
it.\\
369 - Oh, honey, what's the difference?\\
370 - Come on, we want to see it.\\
371 - Let's go down there.\\
372 - Come on, let's go down.\\
373 - No, wait a minute, Fred.\\
374 - You know Lucy, if she...
uh... if, uh...\\
375 - Ricky, I think you sing better\\
376 - than anybody in the whole world.\\
377 - Would you sing for me?\\
378 - Sing? Now?\\
379 - Yeah, now.\\
380 - What's the matter with you?\\
381 - Are you losing your mind?\\
382 - Come on, we've got a freezer down
there\\
383 - and a lot of meat to put in it.\\
384 - Now let's go right now.\\
385 - Wait, wait a minute, Fred.\\
386 - Wait a minute.\\
387 - If Ethel wants to hear me sing that
bad, I...\\
388 - gee, I wouldn't want to deprive her\\
389 - of the pleasure of it.\\
390 - Oh, no.\\
391 - Well, you'd like to hear me sing, eh?\\
392 - All right.\\
393 - You really think I sing good, huh?\\
394 - Gee, that's very nice of you.\\
395 - What would you like to hear?\\
396 - Anything with a lot of choruses.\\
397 - Oh, boy, a lot of choruses, eh?\\
398 - All right.\\
399 - Here's one.\\
400 - Ay mama, ay nene\\

437 - All right, what you like to hear now?\\
438 - How about that dandy little ditty
entitled\\
439 - "Let's vamooso to el freezo"?\\
440 - What would you like to hear, Ethel?\\
441 - Anything.\\
442 - All right, here's one you should
like.\\
443 - Ese lunar que tienes, cielito lindo,
junto a la boca\\
444 - No se lo des a nadi, cielito lindo,

445 - Ay, ay, ay, ay\\
446 - Canta y no llores\\
447 - Porque cantando se alegran, cielito

449 - Canta y no llores\\
450 - Porque cantando se alegran, cielito

452 - Here we come, Lucy.\\
453 - Have you got it all cleaned up, Lucy?\\
454 - Lucy?\\
455 - Hey, this is great, Fred.\\
456 - This is wonderful.\\
457 - Yeah, look how big and roomy.\\
458 - I bet you could hang a whole side of
beef in there.\\
459 - Are you kidding?
I bet that you...\\
460 - Oh!\\
461 - Oh, Lucy!\\

1 - Hi, honey.\\
2 - Hi.\\
3 - What are you doing?\\
4 - Darning your socks.\\
5 - Well, good for you.\\
6 - I didn't know you knew how to darn.\\
7 - Oh, sure, there's nothing to it,\\
8 - especially if you have a darning egg.\\
9 - Boy, you should have seen the hole in
this one.\\
10 - It's taken me half an hour to sew it
up.\\
11 - Hmm.\\
12 - There.\\
13 - Darn it, I sewed up the top.\\
14 - Oh, Lucy, you're amazing.\\
15 - Oh, well, I'll just have to rip it
out.\\
16 - No, no, don't do that.
Why?\\
17 - I can use it as a blackjack.\\
18 - Oh, give me that.\\
19 - No, I've got to fix it.\\
20 - Oh, dear.\\
21 - Honey, where are you going?\\
22 - I'm going to rehearsal, honey.\\
23 - Again? You've been to rehearsal every
day for a week.\\
24 - I know, but I can't help it.\\
25 - Wouldn't it be easier to get good
musicians?\\
26 - Please, no disparaging remarks.\\
27 - I'll get it, I'll get it.\\
28 - Hello.\\
29 - Oh, hello, Jerry.\\
30 - Well, my goodness, Jerry,\\
31 - there must be millions of girls\\
32 - who want to take this job.\\
33 - Oh, look, Jerry, don't I have enough
trouble\\
34 - putting the whole television show
together\\
35 - without having to look for a girl\\
36 - to do the commercial?\\
37 - Uh... uh...\\
38 - Cuantas veces ha dicho\\
39 - que no me llame a la casa?\\
40 - Never mind, never mind.\\
41 - I know what you're talking about.\\
42 - What about a television show, Ricky?\\
43 - Wait a minute.\\
44 - All right, Jerry.\\
45 - I'll get the girl to do the
commercial.\\
46 - Good-bye.\\
47 - Well?\\
48 - Well, I'm going to do a television
show.\\
49 - That's all.\\
50 - And you cannot be on it.\\
51 - Oh, Ricky, please?\\
52 - Just let me do the commercial.\\
53 - Nothing doing.\\
54 - Why not?\\
55 - Look, honey, this is too big a chance
for me.\\
56 - I need someone with a lot of
'sperience.\\
57 - Well, I've had "'sperience."\\
58 - You never even been on a television
show.\\
59 - Well, maybe not, but I've watched
them a lot.\\
60 - There's a slight difference.\\
61 - Oh, now, Ricky...\\
62 - I'm sorry, honey-- I got to go now.\\
63 - I'll see you later.\\
64 - Oh!\\
65 - Oh!\\
66 - Hi, Lucy.\\
67 - Hi.\\
68 - Need any work done up here?\\
69 - Ethel's gone to see her mother for a
couple of days\\
70 - and I got a lot of time.\\
71 - Ethel's gone and you want to work?\\
72 - Yeah, it seems loafing isn't any fun\\
73 - unless she's nagging at me to get
some work done.\\
74 - Well, there's nothing to do up here\\
75 - unless you want a job knocking some
sense into Ricky's head.\\
76 - What's the matter?\\
77 - Well, he's going to emcee a big
television show\\
78 - and they need a girl to do the
commercial.\\
79 - Now you know how good I am at that.\\
80 - Oh, sure, I've seen you do\\
81 - a hundred television commercials.\\
82 - Well, I would be good\\
83 - if somebody would ever give me a
chance.\\
84 - Now, why don't you just relax\\
85 - and forget the whole thing?\\
86 - Gee, if there was only some way\\
87 - Ricky could see me on television.\\
88 - Well, now, maybe you'd qualify as a
lady wrestler.\\
89 - Wait a minute, wait a minute!
I got it!\\
90 - I know what I'm going to do.
What?\\
91 - Well, listen, when Ricky comes home
tonight\\
92 - I'm not going to be here, but you
are.\\
93 - Oh, I am, huh?\\
94 - Yeah, and you're going to turn on
that television set,\\
95 - and you know who's going to be on it?\\
96 - Well, I can only hope it's Faye
Emerson.\\
97 - No, no, it's going to be me.\\
98 - Well, how are you going to work that
out?\\
99 - Never mind, you just turn on that set\\
100 - and leave the rest to me, okay,
buster?\\
101 - Oh, hello, Fred.\\
102 - Oh, hi, Rick.\\
103 - Where's Lucy?\\
104 - I don't know.\\
105 - I came up to watch your television.\\
106 - Ours is on the blink.\\
107 - Oh?\\
108 - And there's a wonderful show coming
on just about now.\\
109 - At 23 minutes after 4:00?\\
110 - Yeah, now, sit down there.\\
111 - I want you to watch it.\\
112 - You'll enjoy it.\\
113 - Call... for...
Philip Morris!\\
114 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
115 - Look, look, Rick, that's Lucy.\\
116 - She's on television.\\
117 - Yeah, how about that?\\
118 - I can't get over\\
119 - how clear the picture is.\\
120 - Yeah.\\
121 - Da-da ta-da-da-da!\\
122 - Well, what do you know?\\
123 - Third-dimensional television.\\

127 - Philip Morris, America's most
enjoyable cigarette,\\
128 - presents the Lucy Ricardo Show.\\
129 - Da-da ta-da-da-da!\\
130 - I don't think this is such a hot
show, Fred.\\
131 - I think I'll get another station.\\
132 - As our first offering this evening,
we...\\
133 - Stop that now!
Go back and sit down!\\
134 - That's very funny.\\
135 - Now, come on out of there.\\
136 - As our first offering this evening,
we present...\\
137 - Lucy, I said come on out of there.\\
138 - As our first offering this evening,
we present\\
139 - that inimitable personality\\
140 - that talented performer\\
141 - that versatile entertainer...\\
142 - Lucy Ricardo!\\
143 - Ricky! Ricky!\\
144 - What are you trying to do?!\\
145 - Are you crazy or something?\\
146 - What are you trying to do, barbecue
me?\\
147 - I'm sorry.\\
148 - Are you really sorry?\\
149 - Of course I'm really sorry.\\
150 - Are you truly sorry?\\
151 - Yeah.\\
152 - Well, are you sorry enough\\
153 - to let me do the commercial?\\
154 - No.\\
155 - Oh, why not?\\
156 - Look, honey, even if I wanted to give
you the job, I couldn't.\\
157 - I already hired another girl.\\
158 - Oh...\\
159 - Say, what did you do with all the
works?\\
160 - I took them out.\\
161 - Well, I can see that, but where is
it?\\
162 - It?\\
163 - Yeah.\\
164 - The chassis slides right out.\\
165 - All in one piece?\\
166 - Yeah, all in one piece.\\
167 - Eww...\\
168 - What do you mean, "eww"?\\
169 - Well...\\
170 - Lucy, what have you done?\\
171 - Well, I didn't know it all came out
together.\\
172 - So?\\
173 - So, I took it out one piece at a
time.\\
174 - Oh, no!\\
175 - Oh, no!\\
176 - Lucy, I've got to be at a television
rehearsal\\
177 - in half an hour.\\
178 - Is my breakfast ready?\\
179 - Are you still not speaking to me?\\
180 - Look...\\
181 - I don't care if you don't want to
talk to me or not,\\
182 - but please get up and fix my
breakfast.\\
183 - I need my strength.\\
184 - Lucy, are you going to fix\\
185 - my breakfast or not?\\
186 - What do you want me to do, starve to
death?\\
187 - Would you, please?\\
188 - Look, I had a perfect right to bawl
you out.\\
189 - Putting that television set together\\
190 - is going to cost a fortune, maybe
more.\\
191 - I'm glad it's broken.\\
192 - Glad?\\
193 - Yes, now I won't have to look\\
194 - at your silly Cuban mug on that show
tonight.\\
195 - Ay, que barbaridad.\\
196 - No se lo que le paso a esta mujer.\\
197 - Cada vez, cada semana\\
198 - se pone peor y peor la cabeza.\\
199 - Yo me voy a ir de aqui.\\
200 - Esta completamente equivocada de
todo.\\
201 - No se lo que le paso.\\
202 - Hello.\\
203 - Oh, Fred, could you come up for a
minute, please?\\
204 - Senora Ricardo and I are not speaking
to each other\\
205 - and I'd like you to do me a favor.\\
206 - Thank you, Fred.\\
207 - Hi, Rick, what do you want?\\
208 - Oh, listen, Fred, I got to go to
rehearsal right away\\
209 - and I'm expecting a very important
phone call\\
210 - and Lucy's mad at me.\\
211 - So would you please stay here\\
212 - and give someone a message?\\
213 - Sure.\\
214 - Well, the girl\\
215 - that is gonna do the television
commercial\\
216 - is going to call.\\
217 - Now you tell her to be\\

224 - Oh, hello, Fred.\\
225 - What are you doing here?\\
226 - Oh, hi, Ricky asked me\\
227 - to wait here and take a telephone
message.\\
228 - He told me that you two aren't
speaking to each other.\\
229 - Oh, well... I'll take the call, Fred.\\
230 - It's silly to have you wait up here.\\
231 - All right, it's from the girl\\
232 - who's doing the commercials\\
233 - on Ricky's television show tonight,\\

247 - Hello.\\
248 - Oh, no, Mr. Ricardo isn't here.\\
249 - Oh, yes, yes, he wanted me to give
you a message.\\
250 - He said to tell you that he's very
sorry\\
251 - but they've already hired another
girl\\
252 - to do the commercial\\
253 - and they won't be needing you after
all.\\
254 - Good-bye.\\

\subsection {Episode 31: The Publicity Agent (1952)}
1 - Oh, boy, how can two people manage to
use so many dishes?\\
2 - What'll we do tonight, Ricky?\\
3 - Nothing.\\
4 - What do you mean, nothing?\\
5 - Let's call the Mertzes and play some
cards.\\
6 - I don't feel like seeing the Mertzes\\
7 - and I don't want to play cards.\\
8 - What do you call what you're doing
here?\\
9 - Tiddledywinks.\\
10 - Play your black tiddledy on your red
wink.\\
11 - Look, this game is supposed to be
played by one person,\\
12 - hence the name solitaire.\\
13 - "Hence thee name solee-taire."\\
14 - You don't want to see the Mertzes,\\
15 - you don't want to play cards.\\
16 - I'll get you a gun, you can shoot
yourself.\\
17 - Thank you.\\
18 - What's the matter tonight, honey?\\
19 - Oh, I'm sorry, dear.\\
20 - I guess I'm just discouraged\\
21 - about my career.\\
22 - Your career? Why?\\
23 - Well, I don't seem to be getting
anyplace.\\
24 - I'm not exciting anymore.\\
25 - You are to me.\\
26 - I mean I'm not news.\\
27 - Can't get my name in the paper.\\
28 - Nobody's talking about me.\\
29 - Oh, they are, too.\\
30 - I hear people talking about you\\
31 - all the time all over the place.\\
32 - Yeah, name one.\\
33 - Well, uh...
just the other morning\\
34 - the milkman asked me how your cold
was.\\
35 - That's what I mean.\\
36 - The milkman wants to know how my cold
is.\\
37 - Big deal.\\
38 - Well, what about your publicity
agent?\\
39 - That's a good question.\\
40 - I should give that 50 bucks a week\\
41 - to someone who can get my name in the
paper.\\
42 - 50 bucks a week.\\
43 - Gee, would you give that job\\
44 - to anybody who's bright and energetic\\
45 - and has wonderful ideas about
publicity?\\
46 - Who?\\
47 - Well, would you?\\
48 - Well, who is it?\\
49 - If I don't get your name in the
paper,\\
50 - it won't cost you a cent.\\
51 - Oh, no.\\
52 - Oh, no, no, no, please, please don't!\\
53 - Now, look, don't...
look, look,\\
54 - just forget the whole thing, will
you, please?\\
55 - Now, just-just-just put publicity\\
56 - out of your mind altogether.\\
57 - Oh, come, now.\\
58 - Oh, my goodness.\\
59 - What a horrible thought.\\
60 - It isn't that bad.\\
61 - Look, you want to help me really?\\
62 - Sure.
All right,\\
63 - just-just forget publicity
altogether.\\
64 - All right.\\
65 - Don't even tell people that you know
me.\\
66 - All right!\\
67 - All right.\\
68 - Okay.\\
69 - All right.
All right already.\\
70 - Good morning, Lucy.\\
71 - Hi.\\
72 - What are you doing?\\
73 - Figuring out the value of my jewelry.\\
74 - Insurance?\\
75 - No, publicity.
Ricky's worried\\
76 - because he hasn't been getting enough
publicity\\
77 - so I'm going to help him.\\
78 - You know how those Hollywood stars\\
79 - get their name in the paper when
their jewels are stolen.\\
80 - Hey, that's a wonderful idea.\\
81 - Yeah.
I can see the headline now.\\
82 - So can I.\\
83 - "Ricky Ricardo's wife robbed\\
84 - of priceless jewels valued at..."\\
85 - 43 dollars.\\
86 - Some headline.\\
87 - Yeah.\\
88 - Hey, how about letting Ricky win a
title like Miss America?\\
89 - He doesn't have the right
measurements.\\
90 - Oh, that's not what I meant.\\
91 - No, we need something like this.
Look.\\
92 - "The Shah of Persia has a standing
order\\
93 - for all of Benny Goodman's records."\\
94 - Well, you can do exactly the same
thing.\\
95 - How?\\
96 - Have Ricky order all of Benny
Goodman's records.\\
97 - Oh, Ethel!\\
98 - This item is good only because it
concerns royalty\\
99 - from a faraway country.\\
100 - That's what makes it exciting.\\
101 - Oh.\\
102 - If we just knew a countess or a
princess\\
103 - who couldn't live without "Babalu."\\
104 - You don't know any royalty, do you?\\
105 - My aunt was queen-for-a-day once.\\
106 - Well, we'll just have to dream
someone up.\\
107 - Let's see, now...\\
108 - we'll tell the papers\\
109 - that an exotic princess is coming\\
110 - from a faraway country,\\
111 - traveling halfway around the world\\
112 - just to hear Ricky Ricardo in person.\\
113 - Hey, that's sensational!\\
114 - Yeah, now what country will she be
from?\\
115 - Well, it can't be too well known.\\
116 - No.\\
117 - I know-- Franistan.\\
118 - Yeah...\\
119 - Franistan?\\
120 - I never heard of it.\\
121 - Neither did I.\\
122 - Princess Scheherazade\\
123 - daughter of the Maharajah of
Franistan.\\
124 - Oh, if she was the daughter of a
maharajah,\\
125 - they wouldn't call her a princess.\\
126 - What would they call her?\\
127 - A maharani.\\
128 - Oh, no, Ethel, that's a maharajah's
wife.\\
129 - Oh.\\
130 - I guess she'd be a "maharincess."\\
131 - "Maharincess."\\
132 - Yeah.\\
133 - Scheherazade, Maharincess of
Franistan.\\
134 - Gee, that's wonderful.\\
135 - Yeah.\\
136 - Too bad she can't really come to
town.\\
137 - Yeah.\\
138 - Of course, that's impossible.\\
139 - Yeah?\\
140 - Lucy!\\
141 - Just call me Scheherazade.\\
142 - You wouldn't dare!\\
143 - I would, too.\\
144 - Will you help me?\\
145 - I'm yours to command, my maharincess.\\
146 - The papers will eat this up.\\
147 - Come on, we got a lot of work to do.\\
148 - Now, you look up the phone numbers\\
149 - of all the newspapers in town.\\
150 - All right.
I got the number of the Post here.\\
151 - And we have to make a reservation at
a fancy hotel.\\
152 - How about staying at the Waldorf?\\
153 - Swell.\\
154 - Hello.\\
155 - Hello, city editor, please.\\
156 - This is the overseas operator.\\
157 - Hello, editor?\\
158 - We have an overseas call from
Franistan.\\
159 - It's a maharani-to-person call.\\
160 - Go ahead, Franistan.\\
161 - Hello, hello,
hello?\\
162 - Hello, this is the maharani of
Franistan.\\
163 - Please do not print in paper about my
daughter, Scheherazade.\\
164 - The Maharincess, she come to America.\\
165 - Yes, she come to America\\
166 - and Maharajah very mad she come to
America\\
167 - just to see famous singer in person.\\
168 - He is famous band leader.\\
169 - Ricky Ricardo.\\
170 - Ricky Ricardo!\\
171 - Ricky Ricardo!\\
172 - R-i-c-k-y R...\\
173 - Yeah, that's right, Ricky
Ricardo.\\
174 - Yes.\\
175 - Now, promise... promise you print
nothing in paper\\
176 - and you do not try to contact her at
Waldorf Astoria Hotel.\\
177 - Waldorf Astoria Hotel!\\
178 - Yeah, good-bye.\\
179 - Good-bye.\\
180 - How'd I sound?\\
181 - Great.\\
182 - Give me the next number.\\
183 - Well, do you know when he'll be in?\\
184 - All right, look, as soon as he gets
there\\
185 - would you please tell him to call me?\\
186 - This is Ricky Ricardo.\\
187 - I'm down at the club.\\
188 - All right, good-bye.\\
189 - Hi, Rick.\\
190 - Hiya, Fred.\\
191 - Did you see the paper?\\
192 - Yeah, I saw the paper.\\
193 - Congratulations, old boy.\\
194 - Look at the size of this type.\\
195 - "Franistan royalty makes pilgrimage\\
196 - to see Cuban idol."\\
197 - I know, I know.\\
198 - "Maharajah's daughter claims\\
199 - Ricky Ricardo is real gone."\\
200 - I've read it, Fred, I read it.\\
201 - Yeah, yeah, well, I'd...\\
202 - kind of think you'd be a little bit
more excited.\\
203 - Not every band leader\\
204 - can make a maharincess flip her
beanie.\\
205 - You don't mean to tell me\\
206 - you really believe that story, do
you?\\
207 - Well, it's in all the papers.\\
208 - Are you out of your head or
something?\\
209 - A member of royalty\\
210 - in some ridiculous place called
"Crafistan"\\
211 - or whatever the name of the joint
is--\\
212 - she gets ahold of one of my records,\\
213 - so she travels halfway around the
world\\
214 - just to hear me sing.\\
215 - Well, that's the phoniest story I've
ever heard in my life.\\
216 - Then where did it come from?\\
217 - My press agent, where else?\\
218 - I told that character I wanted some
publicity,\\
219 - but this is ridiculous.\\
220 - I'll be laughed right out of the
business.\\
221 - Well, now that I think it over,\\
222 - it does sound pretty silly.\\
223 - Of course it's silly.\\
224 - Only an idiot will believe a story
like that.\\
225 - Hello.\\
226 - Kenny. Now, look, what is the matter
with you, Kenny?\\
227 - Are you trying to get me kicked out
of show business?\\
228 - You know what I'm talking about--\\
229 - the story in the paper, the story.\\
230 - Look, that is the most ridiculous,
the most stupid\\
231 - the silliest, phoniest...\\
232 - What?\\
233 - You didn't?\\
234 - Now, wait a minute, Clem.\\
235 - You're not kidding me, are you?\\
236 - Well, I'm going to call the Waldorf
right away and find out.\\
237 - You did call the Waldorf.\\
238 - And the Maharincess of Franistan
registered there this morning?\\
239 - Holy cow.\\
240 - Huh...\\
241 - how about that?\\
242 - Okay.\\
243 - Talk to you later, kid.\\
244 - I guess it's true.\\
245 - Somebody around here just said\\
246 - only an idiot would fall for a story
like that.\\
247 - Now, wait a minute, Fred.\\
248 - Now, let's look at it this way--\\
249 - here's this poor girl\\
250 - sitting in her castle in faraway
Franistan,\\
251 - she gets ahold of one of my records,\\
252 - she finds my voice irresistible\\
253 - and she falls madly in love.\\
254 - There's nothing farfetched about
that.\\
255 - Maybe I ought to go out and come in
again.\\
256 - Gee, I wonder if she speaks English.\\
257 - You know what they speak in
Franistan?\\
258 - I don't know, where is it?\\
259 - Where is it?\\
260 - Yeah.\\
261 - Oh, Fred, don't you know anything?\\
262 - No, where is it?\\
263 - Franistan?\\
264 - Yeah.\\
265 - Well, it's right between
Czechoslovakia and...\\
266 - Below the border of Austria.\\
267 - Well, you know, it's stuck\\
268 - right in between Switzerland and
Persia--\\
269 - right in there someplace.\\
270 - Oh, there!\\
271 - Yeah, there-- Franistan.\\
272 - That's where it is, right there.\\
273 - How about that?\\
274 - Gee, I wonder what you do when you're
introduced to royalty?\\
275 - How about this, Fred--\\
276 - Your Highness, I am delighted to meet
you.\\
277 - Oh, Mr. Ricardo, you send
me!\\
278 - Now, you're sure that Her Highness
said\\
279 - she'd be here at 3:00?\\
280 - Yes, her lady-in-waiting called me\\
281 - right after they checked into the
Waldorf,\\
282 - and she said she'd be here at 3:00.\\
283 - Hey, Ricky...\\
284 - hold it.\\
285 - Thanks.\\
286 - Are you going to put on a whole show
just for her?\\
287 - Yes, yes, it's a command performance,
you know.\\
288 - We're going to do everything.\\
289 - Hey, Rick, I just called the house
again.\\
290 - Lucy and Ethel must be out shopping.\\
291 - Oh, gee, that's too bad they have to
miss it.\\
292 - Yeah.
Uh, fellows...\\
293 - Now, please don't forget how we
rehearsed her entrance now.\\
294 - All right? We tuned up?\\
295 - Okay.\\
296 - Cigarette?\\
297 - Yeah, please, thank you.\\
298 - I guess you must be pretty nervous\\
299 - at meeting royalty like this, huh?\\
300 - Mm? Nervous?\\
301 - No, why should I be nervous\\
302 - about meeting royalty?\\
303 - I don't have to be...\\
304 - Hey, Rick, look.\\
305 - Here they come.\\
306 - All right, fellows, up, everybody up.\\
307 - The Maharincess of
Franistan.\\
308 - Your Highness.\\
309 - Welcome to the Tropicana.\\
310 - Your Highness.\\
311 - Uh...\\
312 - Your Highness...\\
313 - Um... Your Highness, uh...\\
314 - did you have a nice trip over?\\
315 - Yes.\\
316 - Um...\\
317 - Uh... are you... are you enjoying
your stay in America?\\
318 - Yes.\\
319 - Would Her Highness answer\\
320 - a few questions for the press?\\
321 - Yes.
Good.\\
322 - Your highness, is it true that
Ricky...\\
323 - Uh-uh-uh.\\
324 - Oh.\\
325 - Your Highness, is it true\\
326 - that Ricky Ricardo is your favorite
vocalist?\\
327 - Yes.\\
328 - Do you like any other American
performers?\\
329 - No.\\
330 - Now, let me see if I have this
straight--\\
331 - you've never seen Ricky Ricardo in
person,\\
332 - you first heard his records two years
ago\\
333 - and you fell in love with his voice\\
334 - and decided to come to America to see
him.\\
335 - Your father didn't approve, but you
came anyway\\
336 - and you can hardly wait to hear him
sing.\\
337 - Is that right?\\
338 - Yes, no, yes, yes, yes, no and yes.\\
339 - I see.\\
340 - Now, about the political situation\\
341 - in Franistan-- do you...\\
342 - Please!\\
343 - No more questions.\\
344 - The Maharincess want you to sing.\\
345 - Oh, well...\\
346 - I'm deeply honored.\\
347 - When we are dancing\\
348 - And you're dangerously near me\\
349 - I get ideas...\\
350 - Hold it, hold it.\\
351 - What's wrong, please?\\
352 - You sing, she swoon.\\
353 - Please go on.\\
354 - Well, if my singing makes her faint,\\
355 - maybe I'd better not.\\
356 - Please, I like it.\\
357 - When we are dancing\\
358 - And you're dangerously near me\\
359 - I get ideas\\
360 - I get ideas\\
361 - I want to hold you\\
362 - So much closer than I dare to...\\
363 - I want to scold you\\
364 - But I care more than I fear to\\
365 - And when you touch me\\
366 - I perspire in every finger...\\
367 - I get ideas\\
368 - I get ideas\\
369 - And after we have kissed good night
and still you linger\\
370 - I kind of think you get ideas, too.\\
371 - Though your eyes are always saying\\
372 - The things you're never saying\\
373 - I only hope they're saying\\
374 - That you could love me, too.\\
375 - For that's the whole idea, it's true\\
376 - The lovely idea\\
377 - That I've fallen in love\\
378 - With...\\
379 - You.\\
380 - Oh.\\
381 - Encore, encore.\\
382 - Thank you.\\
383 - Really, would you like some more?\\
384 - Really.\\
385 - Oh, I see, uh...\\
386 - uh, Your Highness, I understand\\
387 - that... your favorite number of ours
is... "Babalu."\\
388 - Oh! "Babalu"...\\
389 - "Babalu"!\\
390 - Babalu...\\
391 - Babalu...\\
392 - Well, Lucy, we'd better get out of
here.\\
393 - We've got to check out of this hotel\\
394 - and get home in time for dinner.\\
395 - Oh, but I'm so tired after that
performance\\
396 - at the club all afternoon.\\
397 - It was worth it.\\
398 - Think of all the publicity Ricky's
going to get.\\
399 - Yeah, but why did he have to sing so
many songs?\\
400 - 25 numbers and every other one was
"Babalu."\\
401 - If I'd had to faint one more time,
I'd have fainted.\\
402 - Well, let's get out of here.\\
403 - Okay.\\
404 - Listen, if that's another reporter,\\
405 - don't let him in.\\
406 - Yes?\\
407 - Where is Her Highness?\\
408 - Hey, wait a minute.\\
409 - What do you want here?\\
410 - I want to...\\
411 - Your highness, you are in terrible
danger.\\
412 - Things are not going good in
Franistan.\\
413 - Franistan?\\
414 - Oh, wait a minute, now, who are you?\\
415 - Chief of Franistanian secret police,
Amjan Xanadu.\\
416 - Well, I'm Lucy Ricardo.\\
417 - You do not have to conceal your
identity from me.\\
418 - You bear the mark that is borne\\
419 - only by women of royal Franistan
family--\\
420 - red and black hair.\\
421 - Look, this is just a wig, see?\\
422 - Please believe me, you are in great
danger.\\
423 - The revolutionists are after you.\\
424 - Hey, he's serious.\\
425 - Good heavens, Ethel.\\
426 - Do you really think there is such a
place as Franistan?\\
427 - Hurry.
We have no time to lose!\\
428 - Too late, they are here!\\
429 - Who's here?!
What do you mean?!\\
430 - Who's here?\\
431 - Huh?\\
432 - There she is.\\
433 - Get him!\\
434 - Ooh, what's the matter?\\
435 - Farewell, Your Highness.\\
436 - Please tell Maharajah I have died for
my country.\\
437 - No...\\
438 - no...\\
439 - no!\\
440 - We want royal secret.\\
441 - Look, fellows, you got me all wrong,
I...\\
442 - You have red and black hair\\
443 - of Franistan royalty.\\
444 - What is secret?\\
445 - All right, I'll give you the secret.\\
446 - It's every two weeks\\
447 - a cup of henna to a gallon of water.\\
448 - I'm not a maharincess, I'm a
henna-rinse-ess.\\
449 - She will talk when the tiger gets
here.\\
450 - The tiger?\\
451 - He knows all methods of oriental
torture.\\
452 - Water dripping on head.\\
453 - Death by a thousand cuts.\\
454 - Oh!\\
455 - Ow!\\
456 - The lingering death of the whips.\\
457 - The tiger knows them all.\\
458 - Well, so long, Lucy.\\
459 - Ethel, Ethel, where are you going?\\
460 - The tiger!\\
461 - The tiger, the tiger.\\
462 - Hail, tiger.\\
463 - Hail, tiger.\\
464 - Hail, tiger.\\

4 - Hi, kids.\\
5 - Well, what do we watch?\\
6 - Comedy? Drama? Soap opera?\\
7 - I don't care.\\
8 - Anything but wrestling.\\
9 - Ricky, wait a minute\\
10 - let's not watch television tonight.\\
11 - Not watch television?!\\
12 - What else is there to do?\\
13 - Well, whatever happened to that game
we used to play\\
14 - before television was invented?\\
15 - It was called conversation.\\
16 - Oh, yeah, how did that go?\\
17 - You know, the four of us\\
18 - used to just sit around all evening
and talk.\\
19 - Nothing so unusual about it.\\
20 - In millions of homes all over the
country\\
21 - other people were having\\
22 - the same kind of conversations we
were having.\\
23 - Yeah, that's why television was
invented.\\
24 - Go on, Rick, turn it on, will you?\\
25 - Now, wait a minute, Fred.\\
26 - Maybe Lucy's got something there.\\
27 - Yeah, we're four intelligent,
interesting people.\\
28 - Let's just talk-- exchange ideas.\\
29 - Okay.\\
30 - All right.\\
31 - Well, what do we talk about?\\
32 - Anything.\\
33 - Just let the conversation flow.\\
34 - Let it go where it wants to.\\
35 - All right.\\
36 - Okay, let's start.\\
37 - Well, come on, let's talk.\\
38 - Um... how about those elections?\\
39 - They were really something, huh?\\
40 - I guess so.\\
41 - Elections?\\
42 - Yeah, yeah, I...
what about them?\\
43 - Well, they had them, all right.\\
44 - Oh.\\
45 - Oh, come now\\
46 - someone must know something to say.\\
47 - Oh...\\
48 - What do we watch?\\
49 - Let's see what's on, eh?\\
50 - Okay.\\
51 - Hey, hey, that's good.\\
52 - Oh, it's a movie.\\
53 - That's a pretty new movie for
television.\\
54 - New?\\
55 - Yeah, that little girl is Margaret
O'Brien, isn't it?\\
56 - Look again-- it's Shirley Temple.\\
57 - Look again-- it's Mary Pickford.\\
58 - Hey, that's not tuned in right.\\
59 - I'll get it lighter.\\
60 - There.\\
61 - Oh, honey, that's too light.\\
62 - But don't make it too dark now.\\
63 - Well, if it's too light, it hurts my
eyes.\\
64 - Well, compromise.\\
65 - All right, how's that?\\
66 - All right, that's good now.\\
67 - Fine.
That's good.\\
68 - What are those lines across there?\\
69 - There's too much contrast.\\
70 - I'll fix it.\\
71 - There... how does it look now?\\
72 - Well, I can see the lines much
better.\\
73 - Well, let's try it this way.\\
74 - There, the lines are fading.\\
75 - Yeah, the lines are gone.\\
76 - So is the picture.\\
77 - Well, wait a minute, will you?\\
78 - Okay, okay.\\
79 - All right, leave it!\\
80 - Leave it alone, leave it alone!\\
81 - Sit down, will you?
That's fine now!\\
82 - Sit down.\\
83 - You think that's in focus?\\
84 - What?\\
85 - You think the picture is sharp
enough?\\
86 - Yeah.\\
87 - It's all right.\\
88 - Ah, I can get it\\
89 - much sharper than that.\\
90 - There, that's what I call in focus.\\
91 - Honey, that's too light.\\
92 - All right.\\
93 - Uh-oh, that's too dark.\\
94 - Can't you get rid of those lines?\\
95 - Ricky, why couldn't you have left it
alone?\\
96 - It was fine for all of us.\\
97 - Well, I'll get it, honey, I'll get
it.\\
98 - Now, listen, let me do it.\\
99 - Honey, I know how to do it.\\
100 - I've had it...\\
101 - Honey, please, I know...\\
102 - Oh!\\
103 - Now see what you've done!\\
104 - Me?!\\
105 - Well, that's the end of television
for tonight.\\
106 - Good, I'm glad.\\
107 - Now what are we going to do?\\
108 - Well, we could try conversation again\\
109 - but personally I'm all worn out\\
110 - from the last gabfest.\\
111 - We could make fudge and dress up in
our mothers' clothes.\\
112 - Yeah, that's the best idea yet.\\
113 - Oh, wait a minute.\\
114 - My goodness!\\
115 - Look!\\
116 - A radio!\\
117 - Well, what do you know?\\
118 - It takes a little time to warm up.\\
119 - Well, what are we staring at?\\
120 - This is a radio.\\
121 - Testing, testing...\\
122 - Mr. and Mrs. Eric Findley, meet
Freddy Fillmore.\\
123 - Oh, I remember this show--\\
124 - Freddy Fillmore, Mr. and Mrs. Quiz.\\
125 - How do you do, Mr. and Mrs. Findley?\\
126 - Now, here are your three $100
questions.\\
127 - First, who was the youngest man to be
inaugurated\\
128 - president of the United States?\\
129 - Theodore Roosevelt.\\
130 - Theodore Roosevelt?\\
131 - Oh, no, it was one of the earlier
ones--\\
132 - Adams or McKinley, wasn't it, Ethel?\\
133 - Ask Fred, he was probably there.\\
134 - Oh, time's up, I'm so sorry.\\
135 - The youngest president was 42 years
old\\
136 - the day of his inauguration\\
137 - and his name was Theodore Roosevelt.\\
138 - Well!\\
139 - What do you know about that?\\
140 - You were right-- how did you know
that?\\
141 - Doesn't everybody?\\
142 - "Doesn't everybody?"\\
143 - Oh-ho-ho!\\
144 - Now, Mr. and Mrs. Findley, here's
your second question\\
145 - and remember, only one answer between
you:\\
146 - What was the last state to be
admitted to the union?\\
147 - I know what that was-- uh,
Nebraska, Nebraska.\\
148 - No, it was New Mexico.\\
149 - Wyoming.\\
150 - It was Arizona.\\
151 - Arizona?\\
152 - Er, was it Arizona?\\
153 - You are so right!\\
154 - The last state to be admitted to the
union was Arizona!\\
155 - And you now have $100!\\
156 - Now for your third question:\\
157 - What was the date of Lincoln's
Gettysburg Address?\\
158 - Well, brain?\\
159 - November 19...\\
160 - 1863.\\
161 - Come on, now, Mr. Findley, take a
guess.\\
162 - Mrs. Findley?\\
163 - Sorry, but your time is up.\\
164 - The answer is November 9, 1863.\\
165 - Ha!\\
166 - Oh! Oh, oh, I beg your pardon, I read
that wrong.\\
167 - The answer is November 19, 1863.\\
168 - Ha!\\
169 - That's too bad, Mr. and Mrs.
Findley, but you do have $100\\
170 - and a chance at our $500 jackpot
question.\\
171 - Oh, wait a minute, we don't have
enough time left\\
172 - so we'll just have to ask you the
jackpot question\\
173 - at the beginning of our next program.\\
174 - We're a little late, folks\\
175 - so this is Freddy Fillmore saying
good night\\
176 - and remember to tune in every Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday...\\
177 - I'm very surprised at you.\\
178 - How did you happen to know\\
179 - the answer to those questions?\\
180 - Well, who do you think you're married
to, a country pumpkin?\\
181 - We studied American history in Cuba
too, you know.\\
182 - Well, you're certainly a lot smarter
than I am.\\
183 - I got all I can do to remember\\
184 - that there are 46 states.\\
185 - Forty-eight.\\
186 - Oh, yeah...\\
187 - I guess I forgot Alaska and Hawaii.\\
188 - Yeah.\\
189 - Hey, honey\\
190 - will you fix us some sandwiches?\\
191 - Sandwiches?\\
192 - Yeah, sandwiches-- two pieces of
bread\\
193 - with a thing in the middle and the
mustard on the top.\\
194 - Oh, eat, eat, eat, all they want
to...\\
195 - Come on, Ethel, help me.\\
196 - Hey, you sure fooled me, Rick.\\
197 - I'd have bet you couldn't answer
those questions.\\
198 - I got something to tell you about
that, old man.\\
199 - What?\\
200 - That's why I send them out of the
room.\\
201 - You know, that program was a delayed
broadcast.\\
202 - Yeah?\\
203 - Yeah, they made it this afternoon\\
204 - and I was at the station when they
were doing it.\\
205 - I heard the whole thing.\\
206 - Then you knew the answers before they
asked them.\\
207 - Shh!\\
208 - Yeah.\\
209 - Boy, you...
you tricky Cuban.\\
210 - Woo-hoo!\\
211 - Woo-hoo.\\
212 - What are you doing?\\
213 - I thought we were going shopping.\\
214 - Oh, I guess I was just daydreaming\\
215 - about Ricky knowing the answers\\
216 - to all those questions last night.\\
217 - Just think, he would have won $300--\\
218 - $100 for each question.\\
219 - Gosh.\\
220 - Three crisp, new, green $100 bills.\\
221 - Is that the way you see it?\\
222 - Uh-huh.\\
223 - I see it all in pennies\\
224 - and I'm running barefoot through it.\\
225 - Oh, well, we might as well stop
dreaming.\\
226 - Wait a minute, why do we have to
dream?\\
227 - Why can't he go on that program\\
228 - and win all the money?\\
229 - Sure. Do you think he'd do it?\\
230 - Why not? He knows all the answers.\\
231 - Besides, it'd give him a chance\\
232 - to show off, the big ham.\\
233 - I'm going to call\\
234 - the station right now.\\
235 - Hey, you might win that $500 jackpot\\
236 - then you'd really be rich.\\
237 - Yeah, I'd have golden eggs\\
238 - all over the house.\\
239 - Huh?\\
240 - I didn't realize\\
241 - what kind of a goose I was married
to.\\
242 - Freddy Fillmore, please.\\
243 - Say, wait a minute.\\
244 - It's a Mr. and Mrs. Quiz show.\\
245 - You'll have to go on it, too.\\
246 - So what? Ricky will answer all the
questions.\\
247 - I'll just stand there, keep my mouth
shut.\\
248 - Uh, Freddy Fillmore?\\
249 - Mr. Fillmore, this is Mrs. Ricky
Ricardo.\\
250 - Mr. Fillmore, I don't know if you
know it or not\\
251 - but my husband is one of the smartest
men\\
252 - in the United States.\\
253 - Yes, sir.\\
254 - Yes, sir, and if you play your cards
right\\
255 - you might be able to get him on your
program.\\
256 - Uh-huh... that's right.\\
257 - Well, I'm sure he'd be glad to.\\
258 - Hi, honey.\\
259 - Oh, Ricky, am I glad you're home in
time.\\
260 - Time for what?\\
261 - I have a big surprise for you.\\
262 - Really? What is it?\\
263 - I won't tell you until 7:00.\\
264 - Oh?\\
265 - I was so proud of you last night\\
266 - knowing the answers to all those
questions.\\
267 - Well, honey, I have something\\
268 - to tell you about that, too.\\
269 - Wait a minute-- it's 7:00.\\
270 - Now, what is it?\\
271 - Well, you see, that program that we
heard last night\\
272 - was a delayed broadcast\\
273 - and I was down at the station\\
274 - when they were doing it\\
275 - and that's the reason that I knew all
the answers.\\
276 - What's the matter, honey?\\
277 - ...Xyza, Ricky Ricardo.\\
278 - Yes, be sure to tune in for\\
279 - the Mr. and Mrs. Quiz program
tomorrow night\\
280 - when Freddy Fillmore's special guests
will be\\
281 - Mr. and Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.\\
282 - Oh, no.\\
283 - Lucy...\\
284 - before I kill you...\\
285 - would you mind telling me the
details?\\
286 - Well, you were so smart last night\\
287 - and you knew all the answers\\
288 - and I thought you were a cinch to win
all the money\\
289 - so I called the radio station...\\
290 - And why did you call the radio
station\\
291 - without asking me first?\\
292 - Well, how did I know that you were
faking?\\
293 - I thought you were an overgrown Cuban
quiz kid.\\
294 - Look, all I know is\\
295 - that Columbus discover Ohio in 1776.\\
296 - Oh, fine. Well, what are we going to
do now?\\
297 - What are we going to do now?\\
298 - We'll have to go through with it.\\
299 - It's been announced on the air.\\
300 - I can't back out now.\\
301 - But you know something?\\
302 - What?\\
303 - Tomorrow night, when we get on that
show\\
304 - you better know the answers.\\
305 - What are you going to do if I don't?\\
306 - It's too horrible to think about.\\
307 - Eew!\\
308 - Eew!\\
309 - Hi, Mr. Fillmore.\\
310 - Here are the questions for tonight.\\
311 - Oh, good, Tommy.\\
312 - Well, these ought to be hard enough.\\
313 - Let's see if you can answer any of
these, Tommy.\\
314 - Eh, "To whom do you make your federal
tax check out\\
315 - on March 15?"\\
316 - You don't know that?\\
317 - "How do subfreezing temperatures in
the arctic\\
318 - affect the growth of trees?"\\
319 - You don't know that one either?\\
320 - "Why was the steamship Ile de France\\
321 - put in dry dock recently?"\\
322 - I don't know any of those.\\
323 - You mean to tell me\\
324 - you can't answer these questions?\\
325 - Neither can I.\\
326 - Where are the answers?\\
327 - Oh, didn't I bring them in?\\
328 - I must have left them on my desk.\\
329 - I'll go get them.\\
330 - Say, there's a Mrs. Ricky Ricardo
outside to see you.\\
331 - Oh, yeah, she's one of the
contestants.\\
332 - Have her come in, will you?\\
333 - Okay.\\
334 - You may come in, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
335 - Thank you.\\
336 - You do you do, Mrs. Ricardo?\\
337 - How do you do?\\
338 - Awfully nice of you to come down.\\
339 - Won't you sit down?\\
340 - Thank you. Uh...\\
341 - Mr. Fillmore, you can do me a
tremendous favor.\\
342 - You can get me out of a very big
spot.\\
343 - Anything you want, I'll do, Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
344 - Oh, thank you very much.\\
345 - And do you know why?\\
346 - Why?\\
347 - Because this is the biggest break
I've ever had\\
348 - having you and your husband appear on
my show tonight.\\
349 - Oh?\\
350 - Yes. You see, I have an offer from a
national sponsor\\
351 - who's willing to buy the program\\
352 - if I can get people like Ricky
Ricardo to appear.\\
353 - Oh.\\
354 - And once he's appeared on the show
tonight\\
355 - that'll pave the way for other
celebrities.\\
356 - Oh, I see.\\
357 - You don't realize what a break this
is for me.\\
358 - Now, what can I do for you?\\
359 - Uh...\\
360 - could I have some tickets for the
broadcast?\\
361 - Well, certainly.\\
362 - You can have all the tickets you
want.\\
363 - Pardon me, Mr. Fillmore\\
364 - here are the answers for tonight's
questions.\\
365 - Oh, thank you, Tommy.\\
366 - Have we got some pips for you
tonight.\\
367 - You have?\\
368 - Yes, we sure have.\\
369 - Oh, that's right, you wanted those
tickets.\\
370 - Yes, please.\\
371 - I'll take care of that right now.\\
372 - Yes, Mr. Fillmore?\\
373 - Nancy, will you see that Mrs. Ricardo\\
374 - gets all the tickets she wants,
please?\\
375 - Oh, excuse me.\\
376 - Hello?\\
377 - Oh, yeah, yeah, I've got them right
here.\\
378 - Yeah, we can check it.\\
379 - One...\\
380 - Yeah.\\
381 - Uh, two...\\
382 - Yeah.\\
383 - Uh, three...\\
384 - Uh, yeah.\\
385 - Yeah, that checks.\\
386 - Okay, now, would you read\\
387 - that opening commercial to me,
please?\\
388 - Uh-huh.\\
389 - That sounds good.\\
390 - Sure.\\
391 - Okay.\\
392 - Why, Mrs. Ricardo\\
393 - you wouldn't want to see the answers\\
394 - for tonight, would you?\\
395 - Oh, were those the answers?\\
396 - Well, yes.\\
397 - You didn't see them, did you?\\
398 - No, darn it.\\
399 - Well, good.\\
400 - Uh... well...\\
401 - Good-bye, Mr. Fillmore.\\
402 - Oh, well... good-bye, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
403 - So nice of you to come by.\\
404 - Thank you.\\
405 - I'll see you tonight.\\
406 - Thank you.\\
407 - Excuse me. Hello?\\
408 - Hi, Lucy, you ready to go to the
broadcast?\\
409 - I was just going over these answers--\\
410 - see if I knew them.\\
411 - Here, you hold the paper.\\
412 - Uh, the first one is, "the collector
of Internal Revenue."\\
413 - The second one is, "the sap runs
every two years."\\
414 - The third is, "to scrape the
barnacles off her hull."\\
415 - Perfect.\\
416 - Wonder what the questions are?\\
417 - Who cares, so long as I have the
answers?\\
418 - Come on, Come on. We might as well
get it over with.\\
419 - Oh, honey, don't look so worried.\\
420 - I have an idea I'm going to walk up
there\\
421 - and give them those answers one, two,
three.\\
422 - You're so confident one would think
you knew\\
423 - what the questions were going to be.\\
424 - Yes, one would, wouldn't one?\\
425 - Come on, come on, we're all going to
be late.\\
426 - All right!\\
427 - Let's go.\\
428 - Oh, I forgot something.\\
429 - I'll be right with you.\\
430 - All right.\\
431 - Collector of Internal Revenue, the
sap runs every two years\\
432 - to... to scrape the barnacles off her
hull.\\
433 - Come on, honey, hurry up.\\
434 - It's time for Mr. and Mrs. Quiz.\\
435 - Yes, once again it's time to play\\
436 - that fascinating game, Mr. and Mrs.
Quiz\\
437 - and here to ask the questions\\
438 - is that well-known quizmaster\\
439 - Freddy Fillmore!\\
440 - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen\\
441 - and welcome once again to Mr. and
Mrs. Quiz.\\
442 - Now, for our first contestant tonight\\
443 - we have a gentleman known to all of
you\\
444 - as an orchestra leader and a singer.\\
445 - But what you don't know--\\
446 - and we didn't, either, until his wife
told us today--\\
447 - he's one of the greatest brains of
all time--\\
448 - a real top intellectual.\\
449 - Yes, sirree.\\
450 - And now, just in case you think we
picked questions\\
451 - to make him look good tonight\\
452 - we're going to change our usual
practice\\
453 - and have him select his questions\\
454 - out of this glass bowl, at random.\\
455 - And now, here they are, Mr. and Mrs.
Ricky Ricardo!\\
456 - How do you do, Mr. and Mrs. Ricardo?\\
457 - How do you do?\\
458 - You all ready for your questions?\\
459 - Yes, sir.\\
460 - Oh-ho, they're going to be pretty
hard.\\
461 - Oh, I'll bet they're not too hard.\\
462 - Well, we'll see about that.\\
463 - Now, remember, you only have one
answer\\
464 - between the two of you.\\
465 - Okay, dig right in there, Ricky.\\
466 - Ah, here we go for number one.\\
467 - Ah. What is name of the animal that
fastens itself to you\\
468 - and drains you of your blood?\\
469 - The Collector of Internal Revenue.\\
470 - Oh, I...\\
471 - I... I'm so sorry.\\
472 - You only had one answer between the
two of you\\
473 - and that's wrong.\\
474 - It is?\\
475 - Yes, the answer is, "a vampire bat."\\
476 - A vampire bat, sure--\\
477 - that's what I was going to say.\\
478 - Well, let's try the next one.\\
479 - Maybe we'll have better luck this
time.\\
480 - I'll get the next one.\\
481 - Ah, here we go, number two:\\
482 - What is a senator's term of office?\\
483 - The sap runs every two years.\\
484 - Oh, I... I'm sorry, Mrs. Ricardo\\
485 - but you're not giving your husband a
chance.\\
486 - A senator's term of office is six
years.\\
487 - Six years, sure.\\
488 - Why don't you let me answer one?\\
489 - Well, let's try the last one.\\
490 - Let me answer this one, eh?\\
491 - Here we go for number three.\\
492 - Why did the French people put Marie
Antoinette\\
493 - under the sharp blade of the
guillotine?\\
494 - Um...\\
495 - Well?\\
496 - You got any ideas?\\
497 - Well, come on, Ricardos\\
498 - you must know the answer to this one.\\
499 - Yeah, we know the answer to this one.\\
500 - Okay, why did the French people\\
501 - put Marie Antoinette\\
502 - under the sharp blade of the
guillotine?\\
503 - To scrape the barnacles off her hull.\\
504 - Oh, I'm so sorry.\\
505 - You are the first husband-and-wife
team ever\\
506 - to miss all three questions.\\
507 - What's the matter with you, honey?\\
508 - Well, I memorized the answers\\
509 - but they must have switched the
questions.\\
510 - Oh, no, what have you done to me?\\
511 - Well, anyway\\
512 - you still have a chance\\
513 - at the giant jackpot question\\
514 - and it's worth $500.\\
515 - Ricky, it's not over yet.\\
516 - Now, we've all seen the picture\\
517 - of George Washington crossing the
Delaware.\\
518 - You've seen that picture, haven't
you?\\
519 - Yeah, yeah.\\
520 - And you've seen it too, haven't you?\\
521 - Of course you have.\\
522 - Now, what I want you to tell me is
this:\\
523 - What did George Washington say while
making that crossing?\\
524 - Yeah, I'll repeat the question:\\
525 - What did George Washington say\\
526 - while crossing the Delaware?\\
527 - Do you know, Ricky?\\
528 - Please let me sit down, this is
making me sick.\\
529 - That's right! That's what George
Washington said\\
530 - when crossing the Delaware!\\
531 - Five hundred bucks!\\
532 - The part of Freddy Fillmore was
played by Frank Nelson.\\
533 - The office boy was Bobby Ellis\\
534 - and the announcer was played by Roy
Rowan.

\subsection {Episode 33: Lucy's Schedule (1952)}
1 - Lucy, for goodness' sakes, aren't you
ready yet?\\
2 - I'll be ready in a minute, dear.\\
3 - Hurry up, we're going to miss\\
4 - the start of the movie.\\
5 - I'll be ready in a minute, dear.\\
6 - I wonder what time that feature
starts.\\
7 - What did you do with the paper?\\
8 - I'll be ready in a minute, dear.\\
9 - "I'll be ready in a minute, dear."\\
10 - "I'll be ready in a minute, dear."\\
11 - Ay-ay-ay.\\
12 - Oh, there it is.\\
13 - High Noon, Gary Cooper...\\
14 - 8:23!\\
15 - I'll be ready in a minute, dear.\\
16 - Ay-ay-ay.\\
17 - Lucy, you haven't even got your dress
on yet.\\
18 - You were supposed to be ready an hour
ago.\\
19 - Well, it's all your fault.\\
20 - My fault?\\
21 - Yes, I wasted an hour\\
22 - telling you I'd be ready in a minute.\\
23 - Oh, now, come on, what are you doing?\\
24 - Now, honey, I'm almost ready and
you're not helping any.\\
25 - If you want to make yourself useful\\
26 - get a dress out for me to put on.\\
27 - All right, all right.\\
28 - Which dress you want to wear?\\
29 - Well, which dress you want to put on?\\
30 - I'm thinking.\\
31 - I can't make up my mind.\\
32 - Put on any dress, honey.\\
33 - The Mertzes will be here in a minute.\\
34 - What makes you think so?\\
35 - I talked to Ethel ten minutes ago.\\
36 - She wasn't anywhere near ready.\\
37 - She'll be here.\\
38 - Fred told me that tonight she's going
to be here\\
39 - ready to go, with her coat on, at
8:00, no matter what.\\
40 - Hah! If I know Ethel\\
41 - she's just about getting out of the
tub.\\
42 - Well, look, just in case\\
43 - they happen to be on time\\
44 - would you please decide which dress
you want to put on?\\
45 - Well, what dress would you like me to
wear?\\
46 - How about this one, eh?\\
47 - You like that dress?\\
48 - Yeah, sure, I like it, it's
beautiful, fine.\\
49 - No, Ethel's seen me in that so much.\\
50 - How about this one?\\
51 - Oh, honey, everybody's seen me in
that.\\
52 - Oh, I wouldn't wear that to a movie.\\
53 - Why not?\\
54 - Don't tell me Gary Cooper has seen
you in it.\\
55 - No, it's too tight.\\
56 - Ay-ay-ay.\\
57 - Hi, Rick, here we are!\\
58 - You folks ready?\\
59 - We'll be ready in a minute, dear.\\
60 - Now you got me doing it.\\
61 - You see, he's got Ethel up here,
ready to go\\
62 - just like he said he would.\\
63 - You go out and talk to them, dear.\\
64 - I'll be right out.\\
65 - Okay.\\
66 - Now, look, if you're not ready in
five minutes\\
67 - we're going to go without you.\\
68 - Yes, dear.\\
69 - All right.\\
70 - Hiya, Fred, hi, Ethel.\\
71 - Hi, Rick.\\
72 - You did better than I did.\\
73 - Lucy's still dressing.\\
74 - You're not firm enough.\\
75 - Well, I'll be firm enough tomorrow
night, boy.\\
76 - We're going to have dinner with the
new buss.\\
77 - You're having dinner with a bus?\\
78 - Mr. Littlefield-- the fellow that
bought the nightclub--\\
79 - I work for him now; he's my buss.\\
80 - Oh, I thought you meant bus\\
81 - like they have at the boss station.\\
82 - Oh.\\
83 - Yeah.\\
84 - Well, she better be on time tomorrow
night\\
85 - or she'll really be known\\
86 - as the late Mrs. Ricardo.\\
87 - I heard that remark.\\
88 - Hi, Fred.
Hi, Lucy.\\
89 - Hi, Ethel.\\
90 - Oh, gee, do you look pretty!\\
91 - Is that new?\\
92 - What's the matter with you?\\
93 - Oh, she's mad at me.\\
94 - When I say 8:00, ready or not, I mean
it.\\
95 - I don't get it.\\
96 - Lucy, it's one minute to 7:00\\
97 - and we're supposed to be there at
7:30.\\
98 - I'll be ready in a minute, dear.\\
99 - Lucy, I'm telling you\\
100 - I don't want anything to go wrong
tonight.\\
101 - I'm talking to Mr. Littlefield\\
102 - about making me the manager of the
club.\\
103 - Now, I'm going to give you 25
seconds...\\
104 - 20 seconds...\\
105 - What were you saying, dear?\\
106 - Lucy, you're all dressed and ready to
go.\\
107 - Naturally.\\
108 - Well, I apologize for everything I
ever said.\\
109 - How did you do it?\\
110 - I played a little trick on myself.\\
111 - What do you mean?\\
112 - Well, knowing my own weakness\\
113 - I wanted to make sure that I'd be on
time\\
114 - so I turned the clock back\\
115 - so I'd have an extra hour.\\
116 - it's only 6:00, instead of 7:00.\\
117 - Why, honey, that's wonderful.\\
118 - I'm proud of you.\\
119 - Thank you.\\
120 - You know, I can really get things
done\\
121 - if I just put my mind to it.\\
122 - Oh, gee, I hope the Littlefields\\
123 - have a good dinner.\\
124 - I'm starved.\\
125 - Me, too-- I didn't have any lunch.\\
126 - You know, that clock idea is real
clever.\\
127 - I should have thought of that a long
time ago.\\
128 - Come on, honey.\\
129 - Okay, dear.\\
130 - Gee, look how dark it is, and it's
only 6:00.\\
131 - Yeah, well, the days are getting
shorter.\\
132 - No, they're not, they're getting
longer.\\
133 - Lucy?\\
134 - What?\\
135 - Which way did you turn this clock?\\
136 - Forward or backwards?\\
137 - Backwards, so I'd get an extra hour.\\
138 - Oh, no!\\
139 - You should have turned it forward.\\
140 - Forward?\\
141 - Sure, then when it said 7:00\\
142 - it would only be 6:00.\\
143 - It's now 8:00.\\
144 - Eww...\\
145 - We'll be an hour late for dinner.\\
146 - Come on, will you?\\
147 - Oh, no!\\
148 - Alvin, what do you suppose\\
149 - could have happened to the Ricardos?\\
150 - I can't imagine.\\
151 - I told them dinner at 7:30.\\
152 - It's nearly 8:30 now.\\
153 - Really, when I realize how you rushed
me.\\
154 - "Have it ready on time."\\
155 - "Have it ready on time."\\
156 - "Be sure it's ready on time."\\
157 - Phoebe, you know I consider tardiness
a major sin.\\
158 - I wish I could get you to feel that
way.\\
159 - Oh, darling, why do you persist in
sneaking these in here?\\
160 - They're so cheap-looking.\\
161 - We can afford real fruit, you know.\\
162 - Alvin...\\
163 - Mama gave us that wax fruit\\
164 - for our wedding anniversary.\\
165 - You put it right back...\\
166 - I don't care, Phoebe...\\
167 - Oh, there they are now.\\
168 - Well, come in, come in, come in.\\
169 - I don't believe you've met Mrs.
Littlefield.\\
170 - Phoebe, may I present\\
171 - Mrs. Ricardo, Mr. Ricardo.\\
172 - How do you do?
How do you do?\\
173 - Pleasure.\\
174 - I'm so sorry that we're late.\\
175 - It's just disgraceful.\\
176 - It's quite all...\\
177 - Won't you sit down?\\
178 - Mr. Ricardo\\
179 - you come and sit here next to me.\\
180 - Thank you, thank you.\\
181 - Gee, I hope we haven't ruined your
dinner.\\
182 - Oh, not at all.\\
183 - Of course not.\\
184 - Oh, that's good.\\
185 - It was delicious.\\
186 - You mean you finished dinner?\\
187 - Oh, some time ago.\\
188 - When I say 7:30, I mean 7:30.\\
189 - Oh.\\
190 - Of course, I could fix you something\\
191 - even though everything has been put
away\\
192 - and the dishes are all washed.\\
193 - Oh, well, I hate to bother you, but,
gee, I'm so darn hungry...\\
194 - No, thank you, Mrs. Littlefield,
we've eaten.\\
195 - But Ricky...\\
196 - We've eaten.\\
197 - See, when we saw\\
198 - that we couldn't get a cab right away\\
199 - we had a little snack.\\
200 - Oh, well, if you're
quite sure.\\
201 - It's too bad you couldn't make it for
dinner.\\
202 - Phoebe outdid herself.\\
203 - It wasn't anything special.\\
204 - Just pork chops.\\
205 - Pork chops?\\
206 - Oh, they're my favorite.\\
207 - Oh, then you would have loved these.\\
208 - They were stuffed\\
209 - and about that thick.\\
210 - About that thick?\\
211 - And the potatoes were a masterpiece.\\
212 - Now, Alvin!\\
213 - But they were, my dear, they were--\\
214 - baked, and with big globs of
cheese...\\
215 - and butter.\\
216 - Big globs of cheese and butter?\\
217 - I must have gained five pounds\\
218 - what, with all that cheese and butter\\
219 - and the hollandaise sauce.\\
220 - Hollandaise sauce?\\
221 - What was it on?\\
222 - Asparagus tips--\\
223 - fresh, tender asparagus tips.\\
224 - Are you sure you've both had dinner?\\
225 - Oh, yes, we had plenty.\\
226 - Didn't we, Lucy?\\
227 - Hollandaise sauce, huh?\\
228 - Perhaps you'd like an after-dinner
mint.\\
229 - Oh, where are they?
Where are they?\\
230 - Well, I think I have room\\
231 - for just one teensy- weensy mint.\\
232 - I always say\\
233 - there's nothing quite...\\
234 - There's nothing\\
235 - quite like a good after-dinner mint,
is there?\\
236 - Oh!\\
237 - I'll get some more.\\
238 - I must say, Mr. Ricardo\\
239 - I hope this being late isn't a habit
with you.\\
240 - I like punctuality\\
241 - in the people who work for me.\\
242 - Oh, yes, I know.\\
243 - This was just an accident, sir.\\
244 - Well, I hope it was.\\
245 - Mrs. Ricardo!\\
246 - Lucy!\\
247 - Lucy!\\
248 - Honey, I don't know what you're so
upset about.\\
249 - The Littlefields understood when we
explained the clock business.\\
250 - Mrs. Littlefield cooked dinner for
us, didn't she?\\
251 - It doesn't matter.\\
252 - It was very embarrassing.\\
253 - She wouldn't have had to go through
all that trouble\\
254 - if you would have been on time.\\
255 - Now, how long does it take you in the
bathtub?\\
256 - To do what?\\
257 - What are you writing there?\\
258 - "Lucy's schedule"?\\
259 - Lucy who?\\
260 - Lucy you, that's who.\\
261 - Let me see this.\\
262 - I'm making out a schedule\\
263 - so you can budget your time.\\
264 - Budget my time?\\
265 - You mean like I budget my money?\\
266 - Heaven forbid.\\
267 - Give me that.\\
268 - Now, Ricky, listen...\\
269 - You listen to me.\\
270 - Now, I'm sick and tired\\
271 - of you being late all the time.\\
272 - It's obvious you cannot budget your
time\\
273 - so somebody has to do it for you.\\
274 - Well, I don't think I'm going to like
this.\\
275 - How does it go?\\
276 - Well, we'll write down everything
that you do\\
277 - and we'll allow so much time for each
thing--\\
278 - ten minutes for this, 15 minutes for
that...\\
279 - Oh, I'm going to need more than 15
minutes for that.\\
280 - Never mind.\\
281 - You're going to go on this schedule\\
282 - and you're starting tomorrow morning,
understand?\\
283 - Good morning, dear.\\
284 - Good morning.\\
285 - How about a good-morning kiss?\\
286 - Sorry, it's not on the schedule.\\
287 - You know, as a matter of fact I want
to congratulate you\\
288 - on the way you've been budgeting your
time\\
289 - in the last few days.\\
290 - Well, as much as I hate to admit it,\\
291 - this thing does seem to work.\\
292 - Good.\\
293 - Is breakfast ready?\\
294 - Yep, all set.\\
295 - There's nothing on the stove.\\
296 - Where is it?\\
297 - Well, I knew I wouldn't have time\\
298 - to cook it this morning.\\
299 - So, I had some time left over last
night\\
300 - so I cooked breakfast last night.\\
301 - You did what?\\
302 - Don't worry about it spoiling.\\
303 - It's all in the freezer.\\
304 - Lucy, I can't eat this egg.\\
305 - Why not?\\
306 - It's too salty.\\
307 - Well, I'd cook you another one\\
308 - but it would throw me off schedule.\\
309 - Never mind, I have an appointment
with Mr. Littlefield.\\
310 - Just give me some coffee, huh?\\
311 - Yes, sir.\\
312 - Thank you.\\
313 - Lucy...\\
314 - What's the matter?\\
315 - You always like iced coffee.\\
316 - More coffee, Ricky?\\
317 - Oh, yes, thank you.\\
318 - Another roll?\\
319 - Don't mind if I do.\\
320 - Don't you people ever eat at your
house?\\
321 - Yes, sir.\\
322 - It's just that I have a very big
appetite.\\
323 - Oh. Oh, I see.\\
324 - Well, let's get down to business.\\
325 - I've been thinking over your
suggestion\\
326 - about being the manager of the club\\
327 - and I'd like to talk to you about it.\\
328 - Well, certainly.\\
329 - I've been watching you\\
330 - and I like the way you handle things.\\
331 - Oh, thank you.\\
332 - In fact, you have all the
qualifications\\
333 - to be manager of the Tropicana.\\
334 - Oh, well, then can I...
can I get the job?\\
335 - No.\\
336 - Oh.\\
337 - I'd say yes, except for one little
thing--\\
338 - that business about being late for
dinner the other night.\\
339 - Oh, but that was my wife's fault.\\
340 - Oh, that's just it.\\
341 - If a man can't run his own home\\
342 - I certainly can't give him a
nightclub to manage.\\
343 - Uh, cigarette?\\
344 - Yes, thank you.\\
345 - You can appreciate my position, of
course.\\
346 - Oh, yes, sir, I do, of course I do.\\
347 - Uh...\\
348 - You see, Mr. Littlefield, you don't
understand.\\
349 - That was before.\\
350 - Things are all different now.\\
351 - Oh?\\
352 - Oh, yes, sir.\\
353 - The other night when I got home, I
laid down the law.\\
354 - I made out a schedule and I'm making
her stick to it.\\
355 - And?\\
356 - It's working fine.\\
357 - She's really doing what you say?\\
358 - Oh, sir, I got her jumping around\\
359 - like a trained seal.\\
360 - A trained seal.\\
361 - Oh, I sure would like to see a thing
like that.\\
362 - Well, why don't you come for dinner
tonight\\
363 - and you can see how the schedule
works?\\
364 - May I bring my wife?\\
365 - Certainly.\\
366 - Then she can see\\
367 - that a house can be run on schedule.\\
368 - If it works the way you say it does,\\
369 - you can be the new manager.\\
370 - Thank you very much.\\
371 - Hi.\\
372 - Oh, oh!\\
373 - Hi, Ethel.\\
374 - Uh... sit down.\\
375 - I have three and a half minutes to
spare.\\
376 - Listen, Lucy, you're going to have to
cut out\\
377 - this schedule business.\\
378 - Why?\\
379 - 'Cause Fred thinks it's a wonderful
idea.\\
380 - If it works out, he's going to put me
on one.\\
381 - Well, truthfully, Ethel\\
382 - I find that I get everything done\\
383 - and I have time left over.\\
384 - Of course, I cheated a little bit.\\
385 - What do you mean, you cheated a
little bit?\\
386 - I drew in an extra hour at the bottom
of the chart.\\
387 - Where did you get the extra hour?\\
388 - From the next day.\\
389 - From the next day?\\
390 - Yeah, it'll work out fine till the
end of the year\\
391 - and then I'll be two weeks short.\\
392 - Who can that be?\\
393 - Oh, Mrs. Littlefield!\\
394 - How do you do?\\
395 - Come in, won't you?\\
396 - Uh, this is my neighbor Ethel Mertz.\\
397 - This is Mrs. Littlefield.\\
398 - Sit down, won't you?\\
399 - Thank you.\\
400 - Well, I... I didn't expect you until
tonight.\\
401 - Mrs. Ricardo, what are you trying to
do\\
402 - to the wives of America?\\
403 - I beg your pardon?\\
404 - Your husband told my husband\\
405 - that you're running this house on a
time schedule.\\
406 - That's right.\\
407 - You Benedict Arnold.\\
408 - What do you mean?\\
409 - We wives have spent years persuading
our husbands\\
410 - that we haven't time to do our work.\\
411 - Now, if you go through with this\\
412 - you'll louse it up for all of us.\\
413 - You're darned right.\\
414 - My husband wants to put me\\
415 - on a schedule, too.\\
416 - If my Alvin sees what he likes\\
417 - here at dinner tonight\\
418 - I start punching a time clock
tomorrow.\\
419 - Well, I can't let Ricky down.\\
420 - He's asked you here tonight\\
421 - to show you how proud he is of me.\\
422 - Oh, yes?\\
423 - Well, I overheard him tell my husband\\
424 - that he had you hopping around\\
425 - like a trained seal.\\
426 - Oh, he didn't mean it like that.\\
427 - No, of course not.\\
428 - Trained seal, huh?\\
429 - It was probably\\
430 - just an unfortunate choice of words\\
431 - when he invited us here tonight\\
432 - to "watch you perform."\\
433 - "Watch me perform"?\\
434 - Well, I'm sorry, but you're not going
to see me\\
435 - balance a ball on my nose tonight.\\
436 - Good girl!\\
437 - Lucy, what are you going to do?\\
438 - Will you and Fred come to dinner
tonight?\\
439 - Sure.\\
440 - This is no time for formality.\\
441 - Phoebe, will you help me?\\
442 - Lucy, I'll do anything.\\
443 - Thank you.\\
444 - Me, too.\\
445 - Thank you.\\
446 - Trained seals of the world, unite!\\
447 - Lucy?\\
448 - Yes, dear?\\
449 - Are you sure dinner is going to be
ready\\
450 - when the Littlefields get here?\\
451 - Now, don't worry, dear.\\
452 - Everything will come off right on
schedule.\\
453 - Good girl.\\
454 - I got to hand it to you--\\
455 - that schedule idea was a real
brainstorm.\\
456 - I'm putting Ethel on one tomorrow.\\
457 - Attaboy!\\
458 - You know, that little idea is going
to make me\\
459 - a nightclub manager.\\
460 - Good.\\
461 - Here they are.\\
462 - Come on in, come on in.\\
463 - Hello, good evening, Mr. Littlefield.\\
464 - How are you?\\
465 - Oh!\\
466 - Sit right down here, Mr. Littlefield.\\
467 - Oh, I'd like you to meet Mr. Mertz.\\
468 - Mr. Littlefield.\\
469 - How do you do?
Sit right down.\\
470 - Come in, Mrs. Littlefield.\\
471 - Right over in here.\\
472 - Lucy.\\
473 - What?\\
474 - What is this?\\
475 - Well, can't waste time.\\
476 - Got to keep on schedule, you know.\\
477 - Oh, oh.\\
478 - Oh, Mr. Little...\\
479 - the schedule, you know,\\
480 - Mr. Littlefield, the schedule.\\
481 - Oh. Oh, yeah, very interesting.\\
482 - Well, let's talk.\\
483 - How have you been, Mr. Littlefield?\\
484 - Oh, fine, fine.\\
485 - I had a cold, but I went to the
doctor.\\
486 - He gave me a shot.\\
487 - It went right away.\\
488 - Of course, there's been a lot of
colds going around...\\
489 - Time's up!\\
490 - How are you, Fred?\\
491 - Not so good-- I got kind of a
hitch...\\
492 - Sorry. Mr. Littlefield used up all
your time.\\
493 - How about a drink?\\
494 - Yeah, that's a good idea.\\
495 - I'd love one!\\
496 - Yeah, so would I; had a hard day.\\
497 - A drink would just hit the spot.\\
498 - Well, it's too bad we don't have time
for one.\\
499 - Well, let's sit down and eat.\\
500 - You sit right here, Mr. Littlefield.\\
501 - Fred, you're right across from Mr.
Littlefield.\\
502 - Mrs. Littlefield, would you help me
in the kitchen?\\
503 - I'd love to.\\
504 - Lucy, Mrs. Littlefield is a guest.\\
505 - I don't mind.\\
506 - She doesn't mind.\\
507 - Well, I'm really hungry.\\
508 - Me, too.\\
509 - Well, that's good\\
510 - because Lucy's a wonderful little
cook, you know.\\
511 - Yes, sir!\\
512 - Soup.\\
513 - Soup!\\
514 - Oh, and doesn't that look good.\\
515 - Isn't that nice?\\
516 - Well, dig in, everybody.\\
517 - Lucy, where are you going?\\
518 - It's all the time we had for soup.\\
519 - Got to stick to the schedule, you
know.\\
520 - The schedule.\\
521 - The schedule.\\
522 - I didn't have time to taste it.\\
523 - Too bad. It was delicious.\\
524 - I wonder what kind it was.\\
525 - Split pea, I think.\\
526 - Split pea, yep.\\
527 - Salad.\\
528 - Salad!\\
529 - Well, this is a nice salad.\\
530 - Looks fine.\\
531 - Doesn't that look good.\\
532 - That is really...\\
533 - Did you get any?\\
534 - Me, either.\\
535 - Look, look.\\
536 - There's a radish.\\
537 - Ah!\\
538 - Lucy!\\
539 - What are you trying to do?\\
540 - Just trying to stay on schedule.\\
541 - I'll talk to you later.\\
542 - Well, okay.\\
543 - I think I have some free time at
11:43 tonight.\\
544 - What's the matter, Mr. Littlefield?\\
545 - There's a shirt button in my water
glass!\\
546 - Lucy!\\
547 - Yes, dear?\\
548 - There's a shirt button in Mr.
Littlefield's water glass!\\
549 - Oh, well, I know how that happened.\\
550 - You see, I found that I could save
time\\
551 - by washing the dishes and the clothes
together.\\
552 - What is this?\\
553 - Steak and peas.\\
554 - They look frozen.\\
555 - They are.\\
556 - You see, there's no time on the
schedule for defrosting.\\
557 - But don't worry.\\
558 - We have some nice hot biscuits.\\
559 - Ethel, let's have those biscuits!\\
560 - Here we go, girl!\\
561 - Right smack through the middle!\\
562 - There we go, yes, sir!\\
563 - Pass them right along.\\
564 - That a girl!\\
565 - Come on, Ethel, that's it, kid!\\
566 - Faster, faster.\\
567 - There we go.\\
568 - Come on, a little faster!\\
569 - That a girl, kid.\\
570 - Right straight through the middle!\\
571 - That a girl, very good.\\
572 - Just...\\
573 - Just a minute!\\
574 - I've had enough of this.\\
575 - I tell you...\\
576 - Mr. Littlefield, please.\\
577 - Please, Mr. Littlefield.\\
578 - I think I can explain this, Mr.
Littlefield.\\
579 - So can I!\\
580 - You've got this poor girl terrified.\\
581 - She's scared to death of you.\\
582 - She's afraid of losing a second.\\
583 - Anyone can see that.\\
584 - Yeah!\\
585 - What a temper you must have.\\
586 - Yeah.\\
587 - It's one thing wearing the trousers
in the family\\
588 - but it's another being a Simon Legree\\
589 - an ogre, a... a...\\
590 - Monster.\\
591 - Yeah.\\
592 - Yeah.\\
593 - Well, maybe I have been cracking down\\
594 - a little bit too hard.\\
595 - I should say you
have.\\
596 - Now, first, we're going to get rid of
this nonsense!\\
597 - Yes, sir.\\
598 - Being a slave driver is no way to run
a home.\\
599 - No, sir.\\
600 - But... it's the only way\\
601 - to run a nightclub, Mr. Manager.\\
602 - Mr. Manager!\\
603 - Mr. Manager!

\subsection {Episode 34: Ricky Thinks He's Going Bald (1952)}
1 - Lucy, what are you doing?\\
2 - Honey, remember what you said to me
the first time you met me?\\
3 - I sure do.\\
4 - I said you were a cute little
chicken.\\
5 - Well, I got something to tell you\\
6 - about this cute little "shicken"--\\
7 - she has crow's-feet.\\
8 - You do not.\\
9 - You don't even know what crow's-feet
are.\\
10 - I do, too.\\
11 - They're like pigeon toes.\\
12 - No, they're little lines around the
eyes.\\
13 - Come here, look.\\
14 - See?\\
15 - Oh, honey, are you kidding?\\
16 - You're beautiful.\\
17 - Aw, you're just being nice, Ricky.\\
18 - I am not.\\
19 - It doesn't really bother me.\\
20 - I knew the day would come when I'd
have crow's-feet\\
21 - and your hairline started to recede\\
22 - but I just didn't expect it so soon\\
23 - that's all.\\
24 - But if you say I'm beautiful, I'll
take your word for it.\\
25 - Because after all, you're the only
one I have to please.\\
26 - All you have to do to make me happy\\
27 - is say that you still love me-- do
you?\\
28 - My hairline is starting to recede,
huh?\\
29 - Oh, honey, that's just a figure of
speech.\\
30 - You haven't got anything to worry
about.\\
31 - Oh, I have, too.\\
32 - I'm starting to lose my hair.\\
33 - Ricky, don't be ridiculous.\\
34 - My hairline is receding.\\
35 - Look, honey, look.\\
36 - Are you crazy?\\
37 - You should have as much money as you
have hair.\\
38 - Well, I'm sure this much of my
forehead didn't show before.\\
39 - You're not serious.\\
40 - If your hairline was any lower\\
41 - they'd have to bill you\\
42 - as "Ricky Ricardo, Boy Sheepdog."\\
43 - Well, it's thick enough on top\\
44 - but gee, that hairline.\\
45 - Oh, so your hairline has receded\\
46 - a quarter of an inch.\\
47 - So what?\\
48 - Quarter of an inch?\\
49 - Do you think it's that much?\\
50 - And they say women are vain.\\
51 - Vanity has nothing to do with this.\\
52 - I'm only thinking of my career.\\
53 - Oh.\\
54 - Well, you'd make a nice fountain.\\
55 - What are you doing?\\
56 - I think it's getting thin in the
back, right here.\\
57 - It's getting thin back here in the
back.\\
58 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
59 - Come on to bed, baldy.\\
60 - "Baldy."\\
61 - Ay, que barbaridad.\\
62 - Tiene razon.\\
63 - Se me va a caer el pelo y me va a
llamar "Baldy".\\
64 - Como la aguila americana.\\
65 - Stop muttering in Spanish.\\
66 - I refuse.\\
67 - I won't do it.\\
68 - I will not get bald!\\
69 - Well, don't talk to me.\\
70 - Speak to your scalp.\\
71 - Look, you're not losing your hair\\
72 - and even if you were\\
73 - there's nothing you can do about it.\\
74 - Yeah, I guess you're right.\\
75 - Worrying won't do it any good.\\
76 - Certainly not.\\
77 - Yeah.\\
78 - Good night, darling.\\
79 - I wonder how I'd look without any
hair.\\
80 - Ricky, good night.\\
81 - Oh... oh.\\
82 - Good night.\\
83 - Good night, honey.\\
84 - No, no, no.\\
85 - Ricky, breakfast is ready, dear!\\
86 - Coming!\\
87 - Well, you are in a hurry.\\
88 - What are you wearing your...\\
89 - What's the matter?\\
90 - You're afraid I'll steal it?\\
91 - No.\\
92 - Well, what are you wearing your hat
for?\\
93 - I thought it might rain.\\
94 - Well, now that you mention it\\
95 - the ceiling does look pretty cloudy.\\
96 - My head was cold.\\
97 - Oh.\\
98 - Besides, you never can tell\\
99 - when the plaster might fall down.\\
100 - All right, all right, I'm not asking
you.\\
101 - You got any jam?\\
102 - Yep.\\
103 - Lucy, I want...\\
104 - And what's the big idea of that?\\
105 - You're right\\
106 - the ceiling doesn't look any too
safe.\\
107 - Is my toast ready?\\
108 - Coming up.\\
109 - Honey, take off your hat.\\
110 - I feel like I'm having breakfast in a
beanery.\\
111 - Well, what are you wearing your hat
for, anyway?\\
112 - Well, so I won't get embarrassed\\
113 - with everybody staring at my receding
hairline.\\
114 - Oh, I give up.\\
115 - And please, no more jokes about it.\\
116 - This is a serious matter.\\
117 - All right, who's making jokes?\\
118 - I'll see you later.\\
119 - Hi.\\
120 - Hi, Luc.\\
121 - Hi.\\
122 - What's the matter with you?\\
123 - Oh, I was just thinking about Ricky.\\
124 - He's off on a new kick.\\
125 - He thinks he's getting bald.\\
126 - Ricky?\\
127 - Bald?\\
128 - Yeah, he actually thinks his hairline
is receding.\\
129 - He wore a hat at breakfast.\\
130 - Wait a minute.\\
131 - It's no laughing matter, Ethel.\\
132 - I can understand how he feels\\
133 - now that my hairline has started to
recede.\\
134 - Aw, honey, your hairline isn't
starting to recede.\\
135 - Let me see.\\
136 - Turn around.\\
137 - Never mind, I got plenty hair.\\
138 - It comes way down over my eyes.\\
139 - Yeah, you better cut it.\\
140 - People will think you're a girl.\\
141 - Very comical.\\
142 - Oh, Lucy, you're kidding about Ricky.\\
143 - Why, he's got lots of hair.\\
144 - I know it, but he's got this crazy
idea\\
145 - and he believes it.\\
146 - I got to snap him out of it somehow.\\
147 - How?\\
148 - Well, I thought maybe I'd invite
someone over\\
149 - that was really bald\\
150 - just to point up the comparisons.\\
151 - Mmm-- that's a good idea.\\
152 - Yeah.\\
153 - Now, who do we know that's bald?\\
154 - Yeah.\\
155 - Fred, would you, uh...\\
156 - Would I what?\\
157 - Would you like a cup of coffee?\\
158 - No, thanks.\\
159 - What are you laughing at, Curly?\\
160 - I was just thinking of what Lucy's in
for.\\
161 - What?\\
162 - Well, Ricky will start trying\\
163 - one hair-restoring treatment after
another\\
164 - just like every other man\\
165 - when he thinks he's getting bald.\\
166 - What kind of treatments?\\
167 - Well, you wouldn't believe some of
them.\\
168 - Massagers, tonics, poultices\\
169 - scalp scrapers, suction devices\\
170 - freezing the scalp, burning the
scalp.\\
171 - Why, a man will try anything if he
thinks he's losing his hair.\\
172 - Fred, you've given me an idea.\\
173 - I'm going to give Ricky scalp
treatments.\\
174 - And they're going to be so drastic\\
175 - that he'd be glad to forget the whole
thing.\\
176 - It won't work.\\
177 - Why not?\\
178 - Nothing has ever been invented that a
man won't try\\
179 - if he thinks he can get his hair
back.\\
180 - Oh, yeah?\\
181 - Well, you haven't heard\\
182 - of the Lucy Ricardo torture system of
hair restoring.\\
183 - Oh.\\
184 - How do you do?\\
185 - How do you do?\\
186 - I'm Mr. Thurlow, may I help you?\\
187 - Yes, I'd like to get some
preparations\\
188 - that will grow hair.\\
189 - I see-- won't you sit down?\\
190 - Thank you.\\
191 - What are you looking at me like that
for?\\
192 - Oh, it's nothing, nothing.\\
193 - Now, what did you have in mind?\\
194 - Well, my husband thinks that he's
losing his hair\\
195 - and I'd like to get several kinds of
preparations.\\
196 - I see, Mrs....?\\
197 - Ricardo.\\
198 - Mrs. Ricardo, every case that comes
to my attention\\
199 - requires its own special treatment.\\
200 - Now, I can't do anything\\
201 - unless you're willing to be frank
with me.\\
202 - Just how bald are you?\\
203 - Well...\\
204 - Me?\\
205 - It isn't me.\\
206 - It's my husband.\\
207 - Oh, your husband, yes.\\
208 - Of course.\\
209 - Of all the nerve.\\
210 - You think I actually came in here\\
211 - to buy all these things for myself?\\
212 - Oh, no, no, no.\\
213 - Farthest thought from my mind.\\
214 - Well, that's better.\\
215 - But...\\
216 - But what?\\
217 - Well...\\
218 - You could at least let me show you\\
219 - a more realistic- looking wig than
that.\\
220 - Wig?\\
221 - This is my own hair.\\
222 - Oh, come now.\\
223 - Well, it is-- see?\\
224 - I beg your pardon.\\
225 - My goodness, so it is.\\
226 - Now, if you don't mind, would you
please show me\\
227 - some of those hair-growing things?\\
228 - What would you like?\\
229 - We have ointments, salves, creams,
tonics, scrapers\\
230 - vibrators, suction devices and
agitators.\\
231 - Would you like me to demonstrate
them?\\
232 - No, you just pick out some for me.\\
233 - Yes, madam.\\
234 - Um...\\
235 - Pick out the ones that smell the
worst and hurt the most.\\
236 - Yes, madam.\\
237 - Well, I've been waiting for you to
call me.\\
238 - How did the torture treatment work?\\
239 - Ethel, I just didn't have the nerve
to do it to him.\\
240 - You should have seen some of the
things I was going to use.\\
241 - Awful, huh?\\
242 - Yeah, there must be some less drastic
way\\
243 - to snap him out of it.\\
244 - Well, I still say your original idea
was a good one.\\
245 - What was that?\\
246 - Surround him with people who are
really bald\\
247 - and make him realize how much hair he
has.\\
248 - Bald people-- a lot of them.\\
249 - Yeah, that might work.\\
250 - I'm going to give a party\\
251 - and everybody there is going to be as
bald as a billiard ball.\\
252 - Will you help me?\\
253 - You don't expect me to shave my head,
do you?\\
254 - No.\\
255 - I wonder how many bald-headed men we
know?\\
256 - I want this place looking like a sea
of honeydew melons.\\
257 - Well, I can ask Fred and...\\
258 - Wait a minute.\\
259 - Why didn't I think of this before?\\
260 - I know a man who can put his finger\\
261 - on a hundred bald heads.\\
262 - Who?\\
263 - Mr. Thurlow, the hair-restorer man.\\
264 - Hi.\\
265 - Hi.\\
266 - Lucy, don't count on Fred.\\
267 - He's not coming to your bald-headed
party.\\
268 - Why not?\\
269 - When I asked him, he got highly
insulted\\
270 - and stalked out of the room\\
271 - and I haven't seen him since.\\
272 - Aw, too bad.\\
273 - Well, I guess we'll have enough
without him.\\
274 - Can I help you with anything?\\
275 - Yeah, honey, put some of those around
for me, will you?\\
276 - Okay.\\
277 - How did Mr. Thurlow get all those men\\
278 - to come here tonight, anyway?\\
279 - Well, it seems that they all took
treatments\\
280 - at the same time\\
281 - and he told them it was a class
reunion.\\
282 - Ah, bless their little bald heads.\\
283 - There they are.\\
284 - Oh, good evening, Mr. Thurlow.\\
285 - Good evening, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
286 - Come in, gentlemen.\\
287 - May I present Mr. Johnson\\
288 - Mr. Miller and Mr. Davis.\\
289 - How do you do?\\
290 - And this is Mrs. Mertz, Mr. Thurlow.\\
291 - How do you do?\\
292 - How do you do?\\
293 - Mr. Johnson, Mr. Miller and Mr.
Davis.\\
294 - How do you do?\\
295 - There are six more coming.\\
296 - Oh, fine, fine.\\
297 - May I take your hats, gentlemen?\\
298 - Mrs. Ricardo...\\
299 - I had a tough time\\
300 - getting the boys to come.\\
301 - I had to promise you'd give them
dinner.\\
302 - Dinner?\\
303 - Oh, well, I guess we can take them
out somewhere.\\
304 - And I had to promise\\
305 - you'd give them each ten dollars.\\
306 - Ten dollars?\\
307 - And there are six more coming?\\
308 - $90?\\
309 - Gee whiz.\\
310 - Well, we do have $100\\
311 - that we keep for emergencies.\\
312 - Well, I guess this is an emergency.\\
313 - Pardon me.\\
314 - There you are, $90.\\
315 - Thank you, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
316 - Okay, boys, let me have your hats.\\
317 - There you are.\\
318 - Mr. Thurlow!\\
319 - Well, business hasn't been so good
lately.\\
320 - I need the ten bucks.\\
321 - Thank you.\\
322 - Sit down, gentlemen.\\
323 - All I can say is this better work.\\
324 - Oh, Fred.\\
325 - Come on in.\\
326 - Hello, Lucy.\\
327 - Gee, I'm so glad you could come.\\
328 - Good old Fred.\\
329 - He always comes through in a pinch.\\
330 - Aw, shucks.\\
331 - Could I have your hat, Fred?\\
332 - Yes, ma'am.\\
333 - Well, I guess that evens things up.\\
334 - Excuse me.\\
335 - Hello.\\
336 - Hi, honey.\\
337 - Hi.\\
338 - I won't be able to get home.\\
339 - I got a lot of work to do.\\
340 - Oh, honey.\\
341 - Can't you just get home for a minute?\\
342 - What for?\\
343 - Well, I have a new treatment\\
344 - I want to try on you for baldness.\\
345 - Well, it'll just have to wait.\\
346 - But it can't wait.\\
347 - It's a very expensive treatment.\\
348 - Well, I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I
got a lot of work to do.\\
349 - I'll see you later, good-bye.\\
350 - Is he coming home?\\
351 - No, darn it.\\
352 - This is what I get for being so
softhearted.\\
353 - It cost me a hundred bucks.\\
354 - What now?\\
355 - Torture system, here I come.\\
356 - Lucy!\\
357 - I'm in here, dear, in the kitchen.\\
358 - Hi, honey.\\
359 - Hi.\\
360 - Oh, a beret.\\
361 - Say, you look very continental.\\
362 - Yeah.\\
363 - What's all this stuff?\\
364 - Well, I went down to one of those\\
365 - hair-restoring places today\\
366 - and I am going to give you scalp
treatments\\
367 - to make your hair grow back.\\
368 - Scalp treatments?\\
369 - Yeah.\\
370 - Do you think these things really
work?\\
371 - They're guaranteed.\\
372 - Yeah?\\
373 - Yeah. Come on, sit down.\\
374 - Let's get started.\\
375 - All right.\\
376 - Your roots won't know what hit them.\\
377 - There we are.\\
378 - Now, you just relax.\\
379 - There, now...\\
380 - First we're going to wake up your
scalp\\
381 - with a stimulating vibration.\\
382 - Honey... cut it out, will you?\\
383 - Now, honey, you want to grow hair,
don't you?\\
384 - Yeah, yeah.\\
385 - Makes your whole scalp tingle,
doesn't it?\\
386 - Yeah, my head feels like it's on
fire.\\
387 - Good, that means we got your scalp on
the run.\\
388 - Now for a little brush job.\\
389 - Are you sure you know what you're
doing?\\
390 - Yes, I read all the instructions.\\
391 - Now, this is the one that really does
the trick.\\
392 - Honey, my eyes.\\
393 - I don't...\\
394 - My eyebrows are all right.\\
395 - I don't need any hair there.\\
396 - There, I think we're making progress.\\
397 - Your scalp has a nice, red, healthy-
looking glow.\\
398 - You sure it isn't blood?\\
399 - Oh.\\
400 - Here, try this on for size.\\
401 - What's this for?\\
402 - To cover the mustard plaster.\\
403 - The mustard plaster?\\
404 - Yeah, after you get the mustard
plaster on\\
405 - you wear the stocking to bed.\\
406 - I wear the stocking to bed?\\
407 - Yeah.\\
408 - Well, I don't get it, but I'll do it.\\
409 - Oh, honey!\\
410 - Not on your foot, on your head.\\
411 - On my head?\\
412 - Yes.\\
413 - The next part of this treatment is
very gooey.\\
414 - After I get the mustard plaster on
your head\\
415 - you wear a stocking over it all
night.\\
416 - Oh... oh, I didn't know.\\
417 - Honey, it's awfully tight.\\
418 - Well, I'm sorry, that's the biggest
stocking I could find.\\
419 - Honey, take it off!\\
420 - Take it off!\\
421 - I'm only doing what you told me to
do.\\
422 - Now, never mind.\\
423 - You wear it on top like a cap.\\
424 - I'll fix it later.\\
425 - Here, now, you hold onto that.\\
426 - Leave that right there now.\\
427 - Put your neck in here and hold onto
the bowl.\\
428 - Put your head over.\\
429 - What are you putting on now?\\
430 - Oil, to lubricate your scalp.\\
431 - Oh.\\
432 - What's that?\\
433 - Vinegar, to marinate your scalp.\\
434 - Eggs?\\
435 - Honey...\\
436 - What are you doing now?\\
437 - Mixing in the egg.\\
438 - Oil, vinegar, eggs...\\
439 - Why don't you put some anchovies,
make a Caesar salad?\\
440 - What is that?\\
441 - What are you doing?\\
442 - What is that?\\
443 - Hey!\\
444 - Hey!\\
445 - What is that?\\
446 - What are you doing?\\
447 - What's that you're doing now?\\
448 - What's that for?\\
449 - That's a heat cap.\\
450 - What's that you put on now?\\
451 - It's a heat cap, you have to bake for
20 minutes.\\
452 - Is that the end of the treatment?\\
453 - Yeah, that's it, but we have to do
that\\
454 - every other night for six months.\\
455 - Six months, huh?\\
456 - Yeah, how about that?\\
457 - Well... you know something?\\
458 - What?\\
459 - My scalp is tingling.\\
460 - I can feel something happening
already.\\
461 - Yeah? Well, you have to do it every
other night, you know.\\
462 - I think we ought to do it every
night.\\
463 - What?\\
464 - Then my hair will grow in faster.\\
465 - Oh, no.

\subsection {Episode 35: Ricky Asks For A Raise (1952)}
1 - Hurry up, honey.\\
2 - The Littlefields will be here any
minute.\\
3 - Well, how do I look?\\
4 - Oh, you look wonderful, dear.\\
5 - Oh, fine, how could I look wonderful?\\
6 - I have on an old house dress and
haven't even done my hair.\\
7 - Well, why not?\\
8 - Well, I thought maybe\\
9 - if I didn't look too good\\
10 - it would help things along\\
11 - when you ask Mr. Littlefield for that
raise tonight.\\
12 - Now, Lucy...\\
13 - Maybe I ought to suck in my cheeks\\
14 - so he'll think we don't get enough to
eat.\\
15 - Now, you listen to me, honey...\\
16 - Hmm?\\
17 - Look, I don't want you to try\\
18 - any of your crazy stunts tonight.\\
19 - Honey, you promised me\\
20 - you were going to ask him for a
raise.\\
21 - I will, I will!\\
22 - I just don't want you to go pushing
me into it.\\
23 - Ricky, if you're afraid to ask for a
raise\\
24 - you're never going to get it.\\
25 - I'm not afraid; I'll do it.\\
26 - Well, what are you going to say?\\
27 - Let's rehearse.\\
28 - Rehearse?\\
29 - Sure.\\
30 - You can't leave a thing like this to
chance.\\
31 - Now, look, I'll pretend I'm Mr.
Littlefield\\
32 - and you pretend you're you.\\
33 - Now, we've finished dinner.\\
34 - Mr. Littlefield is full of food\\
35 - and he's leaning back, weak, bloated
and vulnerable.\\
36 - Ricardo, my
boy, your wife sure is a good cook.\\
37 - Go ahead, Ricky, here's where you
speak up.\\
38 - Uh... uh...\\
39 - Mr. Littlefield...\\
40 - Yes, my boy, what's on your mind?\\
41 - Uh... I was wondering...\\
42 - Yes?\\
43 - You couldn't give me any more money
next year, could you?\\
44 - Well, that ought to sweep him off his
feet.\\
45 - Honey, if he wants to give me a raise\\
46 - that will do it.\\
47 - Honey, nobody ever wants to give
anybody a raise.\\
48 - You have to demand it.\\
49 - Now, look, you be Mr. Littlefield\\
50 - and I'll be you-- go ahead, sit down.\\
51 - You're Mr. Littlefield.\\
52 - All right.\\
53 - My boy, that was a good meal.\\
54 - Well, Mr. Littlefield\\
55 - I want to talk to you about my new
contract.\\
56 - How much of a raise am I getting?\\
57 - How much?\\
58 - Yes, how much?\\
59 - You know, Mr. Littlefield\\
60 - I have to decide whether to stay with
you\\
61 - or accept one of my many other
offers.\\
62 - I don't have any other offers.\\
63 - Oh, well, honey, I know that\\
64 - but Mr. Littlefield doesn't know it.\\
65 - Now put yourself in his place.\\
66 - Think-- how would you react,
honestly?\\
67 - Well, Mr. Littlefield\\
68 - are you going to top those other
offers\\
69 - or do I quit?\\
70 - What do you say?\\
71 - Don't quit, my boy.\\
72 - I'll give you the raise.\\
73 - See?\\
74 - Hey, I got the raise!\\
75 - That's right.\\
76 - What do you know?\\
77 - How about that?\\
78 - Yeah...\\
79 - I just hope the Littlefield\\
80 - sees thins that lowgically.\\
81 - Don't worry;\\
82 - he'll see "thins" that "lowgically."\\
83 - Come on, let's go into the parlor\\
84 - and wait for the fly.\\
85 - Oh, that was a wonderful dinner.\\
86 - Your wife certainly knows how to
cook, Ricky.\\
87 - Oh, thank you.\\
88 - Phoebe, I want you to get\\
89 - Mrs. Ricardo's recipe for that
cheesecake.\\
90 - It was delicious.\\
91 - Yes, Alvin, I'd love it, Lucy, if
you'll give it to me.\\
92 - Oh, I'd be glad to.\\
93 - I'll write it out before you leave.\\
94 - Did you say something?\\
95 - No, no, but Ricky has something to
ask you\\
96 - don't you, dear?\\
97 - Uh...\\
98 - Oh, no, not really, it can wait.\\
99 - No, go ahead, dear.\\
100 - Yes, Ricky, what is it?\\
101 - Well, um...\\
102 - Mr. Littlefield...\\
103 - Yes?\\
104 - Mr. Littlefield, you and I\\
105 - are going to have to have a talk very
soon\\
106 - about my new contract.\\
107 - And there's one thing I have to know\\
108 - and I have to know it right away.\\
109 - What's that?\\
110 - You couldn't give me\\
111 - any more money next year, could you?\\
112 - Well...\\
113 - as a matter of fact, Ricky\\
114 - I've been thinking over the idea of
giving you a raise.\\
115 - Yes?\\
116 - And my boy...\\
117 - it's out of the question.\\
118 - Why?\\
119 - The nightclub business isn't what it
used to be--\\
120 - taxes have come up, things are more
expensive.\\
121 - So you can see that I'm in no
position\\
122 - to give you any more money.\\
123 - Oh, yes, sir, absolutely\\
124 - it's out of the question.\\
125 - You want any more coffee, Mrs.
Littlefield?\\
126 - Well, Ricky, I guess you're just
going to have to accept\\
127 - one of those other offers then.\\
128 - "Other offers"?\\
129 - Yes, Ricky wasn't going to say
anything--\\
130 - he's so loyal, you know--\\
131 - but other clubs have been clamoring
for him.\\
132 - Really?\\
133 - Oh, I wouldn't say...\\
134 - Just the other day a club owner
called--\\
135 - I won't mention any names--\\
136 - and offered Ricky twice as much money\\
137 - as you're paying him.\\
138 - It wasn't twice as much.\\
139 - Oh, no, that's right, it was three
times as much.\\
140 - But Ricky said, "No, no, if it's at
all possible\\
141 - I want to stay with good old Mr.
Littlefield."\\
142 - Didn't you, Ricky?\\
143 - Oh, yes, yeah, yeah--\\
144 - my zact words.\\
145 - His "zact" words.\\
146 - Well, that's very flattering.\\
147 - You understand, Mr. Littlefield\\
148 - I don't want to leave.\\
149 - I want to stay right where I am.\\
150 - I don't want to go anyplace, you
know.\\
151 - I'm happy there.\\
152 - But the people--\\
153 - they're offering me so much money\\
154 - I mean, I, uh...\\
155 - I don't know what else to do, you
know.\\
156 - I see, I see your problem.\\
157 - Uh, how many such offers have you
had?\\
158 - Four.
Twelve.\\
159 - Um...\\
160 - I got eight more this morning.\\
161 - Oh...\\
162 - Well, Mr. Littlefield?\\
163 - Oh, this is a very difficult
decision.\\
164 - Very difficult, very difficult.\\
165 - You've been wonderful for the
Tropicana.\\
166 - We have a fine personal
relationship...\\
167 - Yes?\\
168 - I can't stand in your way, my boy.\\
169 - Take one of those other offers.\\
170 - Onward and upward\\
171 - and you'll get to the top of the
heap.\\
172 - But Mr. Littlefield, you don't
understand.\\
173 - If you don't give Ricky that raise\\
174 - you'll lose him, he'll quit.\\
175 - I understand perfectly.\\
176 - Oh, you do?\\
177 - We'll give him one more chance, dear.\\
178 - Uh... Mr. Littlefield\\
179 - are you sure you don't want to change
your mind\\
180 - and snap him up before it's too late?\\
181 - No.\\
182 - No?\\
183 - No?\\
184 - No! N-O.\\
185 - All right, I quit. K-W-I-T!\\
186 - All right.\\
187 - All right.\\
188 - All right.\\
189 - All right!\\
190 - And don't think you're going to get
my recipe\\
191 - for cheesecake, either!\\
192 - What?\\
193 - Lucy, what's the meaning of this?\\
194 - What?\\
195 - This ad in the paper says\\
196 - that Xavier Valdez and his orchestra\\
197 - are opening at the Tropicana Club
Thursday night.\\
198 - Isn't Ricky there anymore?\\
199 - No, thanks to a certain big-mouth
redhead.\\
200 - What are you talking about?\\
201 - Well, the other night\\
202 - Ricky told Mr. Littlefield\\
203 - that he had to have a raise or he'd
quit\\
204 - and I egged him onto it.\\
205 - And?\\
206 - That was some of the rottenest egging
I ever did.\\
207 - Oh, Lucy, how's Ricky taking it?\\
208 - Just terrible-- he's done nothing\\
209 - but mope around the house for two
days--\\
210 - won't even get out of his pajamas.\\
211 - Hi, Ethel.\\
212 - Oh, hi, Ricky.\\
213 - I'll get your breakfast.\\
214 - No, no, thank you, thank you.\\
215 - I want to get downtown.\\
216 - Oh, that's the spirit, Ricky.\\
217 - Don't let this get you down-- get out
and fight.\\
218 - You'll be bringing home a check again
any day now.\\
219 - That's right; I'm on my way\\
220 - to the unemployment office right now.\\
221 - Well, how does it feel to be married
to an also-been?\\
222 - An "also-been"?\\
223 - He means a has-ran.\\
224 - Gee, it's pitiful, Ethel.\\
225 - I got to do something about getting
his job back.\\
226 - Well, maybe this Xavier Valdez won't
work out\\
227 - and Mr. Littlefield will be forced\\
228 - to ask Ricky to come back again.\\
229 - Wouldn't it be wonderful\\
230 - if nobody showed up for Xavier's
opening?\\
231 - It would take a miracle, though.\\
232 - Yeah...\\
233 - Wait a minute!\\
234 - What?\\
235 - I feel a miracle coming on!\\
236 - What do you mean?\\
237 - Listen, there are 75 tables at the
Tropicana.\\
238 - What if I called as 75 different
people\\
239 - and made 75 reservations\\
240 - and then at the last minute got 75
headaches\\
241 - and couldn't make it?\\
242 - Hey, that might work out.\\
243 - Sure, the place would be empty.\\
244 - I'm going to call the Tropicana right
now.\\
245 - Tropicana Club.\\
246 - Hello, this
is Mrs. Worthington Proudfoot.\\
247 - I'd like to make a reservation for
Thursday evening.\\
248 - Oh, fine, Mrs. Proudfoot.\\
249 - You are our first reservation.\\
250 - Oh, how charming.\\
251 - Charming, yes.\\
252 - I'd like a table for eight, please.\\
253 - Yes...\\
254 - Yes, you're welcome.\\
255 - It worked!\\
256 - Who'll I be now?\\
257 - Say, listen, Ethel, why don't you go
down\\
258 - and make reservations on your phone?\\
259 - That way we'll tie up the line\\
260 - and nobody else will be able to get a
table.\\
261 - That's a good idea.\\
262 - Okay, I think I'll be a celebrity
this time.\\
263 - I'll check with you later.\\
264 - Okay, honey.\\
265 - Hello,
Tropicana, darling?\\
266 - I'd like a reservation for Thursday,
darling.\\
267 - Yes, I'd like one of those darling
little tables\\
268 - underneath those darling little palm
trees, darling.\\
269 - Yes, good-bye.\\
270 - Hello, Tropicana.\\
271 - Yes, we have a nice table for two.\\
272 - De la chopa.\\
273 - Thank you.\\
274 - Hello, Tropicana.\\
275 - Yes, Mrs. Thompson.\\
276 - J-just one minute, please.\\
277 - Hello, Mrs. Bennett?\\
278 - Y-yes, would you hold for a second,
please?\\
279 - Yes, Mrs. Thompson.\\
280 - All right, Mrs. Bennett, all right,
all right.\\
281 - That's right, that's four at 8:00.\\
282 - Eight at 10:00.\\
283 - Ten at...\\
284 - Oh... sorry... I'm very sorry.\\
285 - I'm very sorry...\\
286 - No, I didn't mean you.\\
287 - Mrs., uh, Mrs., uh...\\
288 - Oh! Mon dieu!\\
289 - Thank you. Thank you very much.\\
290 - We'd be delighted to see you.\\
291 - Good-bye.\\
292 - Well, how's everything going,
Maurice?\\
293 - It's amazing, Mr. Littlefield.\\
294 - We opened the book for reservations
two hours ago\\
295 - and we are completely, completely
sold out.\\
296 - Splendid, splendid.\\
297 - I cannot understand it.\\
298 - This is the first time this has
happened\\
299 - in the history of the club.\\
300 - It's quite clear to me:\\
301 - I finally hired someone with talent.\\
302 - Hello, Tropicana Club.\\
303 - No, I'm very, very sorry, we are all
booked up\\
304 - we are completely sold out.\\
305 - Yes, yes.\\
306 - But it's impossible, madame, that's
impossible.\\
307 - Oh, well, are
you sure\\
308 - that you don't have just one little
table\\
309 - for Scarlet Culpepper?\\
310 - Oh, well, I am sorry.\\
311 - Is that so?\\
312 - Well, I declare.\\
313 - Well, bye now.\\
314 - Whew!\\
315 - Oh, brother...\\
316 - I can't make one more phone call.\\
317 - My finger's all worn down to a nub.\\
318 - You won't have to, they're all sold
out.\\
319 - Good.\\
320 - Harry and Bess Truman got the last
table.\\
321 - Hey, this'll make Ricky look pretty
good, huh, Fred?\\
322 - Well, I don't know if it will make
Ricky look good\\
323 - but it will certainly make the other
guy look bad.\\
324 - Hey, that's right, Ethel.\\
325 - We have to make Mr. Littlefield
realize\\
326 - that those people aren't showing up\\
327 - because Ricky Ricardo isn't there.\\
328 - Oh, yeah.\\
329 - How?\\
330 - Gee, I don't know.\\
331 - I guess we'll just have to go in and
sit down at the table\\
332 - and then everybody get up and walk
out\\
333 - when we find out Ricky isn't playing
there.\\
334 - Oh, no, we'd be recognized.\\
335 - Well, not necessarily.\\
336 - Depends on how we're fixed up.\\
337 - Sure, we could all be disguised.\\
338 - Yeah.\\
339 - But, Lucy, one table of people
walking out\\
340 - isn't going to mean anything.\\
341 - Well, maybe we could go out and come
back\\
342 - a couple of times or something.\\
343 - How?\\
344 - Well...\\
345 - Wait a minute.\\
346 - What?\\
347 - I got a pal that's a quick-change
artist.\\
348 - Hal King!\\
349 - Yeah, and I'll bet\\
350 - he'd let us borrow all his trick
wardrobe.\\
351 - Well, call him up!\\
352 - What are you waiting for? Come on!\\
353 - Well...\\
354 - everything all set?\\
355 - Yes, sir, everything is fine.\\
356 - Ah, wonderful, wonderful.\\
357 - In a few moments, this room will be
filled\\
358 - with 300 jolly, fun-seeking,
money-spending revelers.\\
359 - Psst, psst, they're beginning to
arrive.\\
360 - Good evening.\\
361 - Good evening.\\
362 - Do you have a reservation?\\
363 - Mrs.
Worthington Proudfoot and party.\\
364 - Oh, yes, yes.
table 29.\\
365 - Yes, yes.\\
366 - This way, please.\\
367 - Charming place.\\
368 - They changed the decor here.\\
369 - Is, uh, this satisfactory?\\
370 - Oh, yes, everything's fine, thank
you.\\
371 - You know, my dear, you're going to be
very impressed\\
372 - with this chap Ricky Ricardo.\\
373 - Very remarkable chap, Ricky Ricardo.\\
374 - Oh, I'm sorry, madame.\\
375 - What about?\\
376 - Uh, Ricky...\\
377 - Yes, Ricky Ricardo is not here
anymore.\\
378 - Oh, but we have\\
379 - that world-famous entertainer Xavier
Valdez.\\
380 - No Ricky Ricardo?!\\
381 - But we only came here to hear Ricky
Ricardo.\\
382 - Certainement.\\
383 - If the Ricardo chap isn't here, we
may as well pop off.\\
384 - Indeed.\\
385 - Um, um...\\
386 - Oh, please, please, wait.\\
387 - You'll enjoy Xavier Valdez.\\
388 - He's a lot more clever than Ricky
Ricardo.\\
389 - Please!\\
390 - Really...\\
391 - no one is more clever than Ricky
Ricardo, peasant.\\
392 - Where is everybody?!\\
393 - Well, I don't know.\\
394 - There was that one group over there\\
395 - but they walked out.\\
396 - Yes, yes, I know, I know.\\
397 - Good evening.\\
398 - Mrs. Miriam
Chumley and party.\\
399 - Oh, certainly, table 27.\\
400 - Ah, this way, please.\\
401 - Good evening.\\
402 - Righto, righto.\\
403 - Hiya.\\
404 - Good evening.\\
405 - The rest of my party ain't here yet.\\
406 - Do you have a reservation?\\
407 - Do I have a reservation?\\
408 - Of course I have a reservation.\\
409 - 17 people, that's all.\\
410 - MacGillicuddy.\\
411 - MacGillicuddy...\\
412 - Miss MacGillicuddy.\\
413 - Oh! Yes, indeed, yes.\\
414 - Maurice, Maurice!\\
415 - Miss MacGillicuddy's table, number
11.\\
416 - The rest of her party will be here
shortly.\\
417 - This way, please, Miss MacGillicuddy.\\
418 - Hiya, Maury.\\
419 - Fine, thank you.\\
420 - How are you?\\
421 - Fine.\\
422 - This is your table right here.\\
423 - I guess I'm a little early.\\
424 - This is my favorite club.\\
425 - You always put on a good show here.\\
426 - I always say that.\\
427 - I always tell everybody that.\\
428 - You should hear me.\\
429 - I always say, "You never get let down\\
430 - if you go and see Ricky Ricardo."\\
431 - That's what I always say.\\
432 - But, uh, Ricky Ricardo is not here
anymore.\\
433 - Ricky Ricardo ain't here no more?!\\
434 - Well, I'm getting out of this crummy
dump.\\
435 - Oh, but if you please...\\
436 - Please, save your breath.\\
437 - I beg your pardon.\\
438 - Did I hear you say\\
439 - that Ricky Ricardo isn't here
anymore?\\
440 - Yeah, how do you like that?\\
441 - Well, I don't like it at all.\\
442 - Oh, please, please, please\\
443 - I assure you if you stay\\
444 - you won't be disappointed.\\
445 - Ha!\\
446 - My good man, is Ricky Ricardo\\
447 - appearing here tonight or not?\\
448 - Well... no.\\
449 - That's all.\\
450 - Let me use your telephone.\\
451 - Please, Mrs. Chumley,
no, if you just...\\
452 - Say, buster, who's the stupe\\
453 - that let Ricky Ricardo slip through
his fingers?\\
454 - You?\\
455 - Well... yes.\\
456 - Oh, brother.\\
457 - Hello, Mary, this is Miriam.\\
458 - I just called to tell you\\
459 - not to bother to come to the
Tropicana Club tonight.\\
460 - Ricky Ricardo isn't appearing here
anymore.\\
461 - Yes, I knew you'd want to know.\\
462 - Oh, no, no, please.\\
463 - Cancel Mrs. Ackerman's reservation.\\
464 - But Mrs. Ackerman has a reservation
for 30 people!\\
465 - I know.\\
466 - That a girl, Crumley.\\
467 - Here we go, up and at 'em.\\
468 - Oh, but ladies, ladies...\\
469 - You're jolly well stupid, you know.\\
470 - Now, do not worry, Mr. Littlefield.\\
471 - After all, they looked rather
strange.\\
472 - Maybe they did look strange\\
473 - but they were paying customers.\\
474 - Hello.\\
475 - Ah...\\
476 - Oh...\\
477 - Oh, it's you.\\
478 - What's the matter, Alvin?\\
479 - Well, where is everybody?\\
480 - They're all out washing their hands.\\
481 - Isn't this opening night?\\
482 - Aren't you sold out?\\
483 - What happened?\\
484 - Oh, please, please\\
485 - stop asking so many questions,
Phoebe.\\
486 - Here, sit down.\\
487 - Pretend you're enjoying yourself.\\
488 - Hmm?\\
489 - Well, at least smile.\\
490 - Ohh...\\
491 - Uh... good evening.\\
492 - Do you have a reservation?\\
493 - Oh, of course we
have a reservation.\\
494 - Don't we have a reservation?\\
495 - Oh, dear!\\
496 - Hazel, look!\\
497 - Oh...\\
498 - Countess Blueblichki\\
499 - Ricky Ricardo isn't playing here
tonight.\\
500 - Ricky Ricardo is
not here anymore?\\
501 - Well, Mr. Ricardo finished his
engagement here.\\
502 - Well, where is he playing?\\
503 - We'll go there.\\
504 - Yes.
Yes.\\
505 - Well, that does it.\\
506 - Maurice, get Ricky Ricardo on the
phone.\\
507 - If I don't get him back, I'll go
bankrupt!\\
508 - That's a very smart move, my man.\\
509 - Yes, yes.\\
510 - When you get Ricky Ricardo back here\\
511 - we'll be back again.\\
512 - Good-bye.\\
513 - Come, girls.\\
514 - Gee, I wish Ricky would come home\\
515 - or phone or something.\\
516 - Didn't his note say he'd phone?\\
517 - No, it just says...
it says\\
518 - "Mr. Littlefield called and wanted to
talk to me.\\
519 - I think he wants to hire me back."\\
520 - Oh, hiya, folks!\\
521 - Hi, Ricky.\\
522 - Hi, honey.\\
523 - How's everybody?\\
524 - We got your note.
What happened?\\
525 - Oh, Lucy, you should have seen what
happened.\\
526 - No kidding.\\
527 - Let's see, I went down to the
Tropicana\\
528 - and there wasn't one single solitary
soul in the place.\\
529 - No?\\
530 - And not only that, but Maurice told
me\\
531 - that the few people that came in\\
532 - as soon as they found out that I
wasn't there...\\
533 - out they went.\\
534 - Fantastic.\\
535 - My goodness.\\
536 - Boy!\\
537 - Well, I guess I didn't realize\\

2 - Lucy?\\
3 - Is that you, sweetie pie?\\
4 - Oh, gee, I'm glad you're home.\\
5 - How's about a great big...?\\
6 - Well, see you later.\\
7 - Lucy...\\
8 - come here.\\
9 - What's the matter?\\
10 - I stopped by the bank on the way home\\
11 - and they show me this.\\
12 - What's that?\\
13 - Your check to the beauty parlor.\\
14 - I write a check to the beauty parlor
every month.\\
15 - Yes, I know that,\\
16 - but they don't always have\\
17 - a little note in the back like this
one:\\
18 - "Dear teller, be a lamb\\
19 - and don't put this through till next
month."\\
20 - Now what do you got to say for
yourself?\\
21 - That's why they call them tellers--\\
22 - they go around blabbing everything
they know.\\
23 - Lucy.\\
24 - Now, look. I'm serious.\\
25 - I don't know what's the matter with
you.\\
26 - Every month, every single month\\
27 - your bank account is overdrawn.\\
28 - Now, what is the reason?\\
29 - You don't give me enough money?\\
30 - I don't give you enough money?!\\
31 - Well, we both agree.\\
32 - That must be the reason.\\
33 - Now look, Lucy.\\
34 - Yes, sir?\\
35 - Do you think this is a game we're
playing?\\
36 - No, sir.\\
37 - Do you realize how tough it is\\
38 - for a guy to make a buck these days?\\
39 - Yes, sir, yes, sir.\\
40 - Do you think that the money grows on
trees?\\
41 - No.\\
42 - LUCY: No, no, come on.
Come in and sit down.\\
43 - No, thanks. I went to the fights last
night.\\
44 - Fred, please come in, will you?\\
45 - Come in, Ethel.\\
46 - Yeah, please, please come in.\\
47 - I-I... Fred, I want to ask your
advice on a certain subject.\\
48 - What subject?\\
49 - Well, tell me something, will you?\\
50 - How often is Ethel's checking account
overdrawn?\\
51 - Never.\\
52 - RICKY: Never?! How do you manage
that?\\
53 - It's easy.\\
54 - I never had enough money at one time\\
55 - to open a checking account.\\
56 - What?!\\
57 - She spends money\\
58 - like I was printing it in the
basement.\\
59 - Printing in the basement... hah!\\
60 - Let's face it, Rick, when it comes to
money,\\
61 - there are two kinds of people:\\
62 - The earners and the spenders,\\
63 - or as they are more popularly known,\\
64 - husbands and wives.\\
65 - RICKY: Yeah.\\
66 - Brother, if they had to make the
dollar\\
67 - they would think twice before
spending it that fast.
Yeah.\\
68 - What's so tough about earning a
living?\\
69 - Yeah.\\
70 - Have you ever done it?\\
71 - No, but I could.\\
72 - Ha!\\
73 - ETHEL: I could, too.\\
74 - Ha!\\
75 - (chortling)\\
76 - Listen, holding down a job is a lot
more difficult\\
77 - than lying around the house all day
long.\\
78 - Lying around the...?
Lying around the...?\\
79 - Is that all you think we do?\\
80 - Yeah.\\
81 - Well, now, let's be fair, Rick.\\
82 - Every once in a while, they get up
and play canasta.\\
83 - Who do you think does the housework?\\
84 - And who do you think\\
85 - cooks all the meals?
Yeah.\\
86 - Oh, anybody can cook and do the
housework.\\
87 - Ha! I'd just like to see you two try
it for a week.\\
88 - Okay, we will.\\
89 - We will?\\
90 - Yeah.\\
91 - This I got to see.\\
92 - I want to get a load...\\
93 - Yeah, but wait a minute.\\
94 - You will have to go out and earn the
living.\\
95 - Okay, we will.\\
96 - We will?\\
97 - Yeah. We'll change places.\\
98 - We'll get jobs, and you take care of
the house\\
99 - for a week. Okay?\\
100 - Okay.\\
101 - Okay?\\
102 - Okay.
Okay.\\

111 - Well, happy housework.\\
112 - Happy job hunting.\\
113 - Thank you.\\
114 - Oh, boy, does this look good.\\
115 - Mmm.\\
116 - I'm hungry this morning, too.\\
117 - (chuckles)\\
118 - Mmm. It is good.\\
119 - Why, naturally.\\
120 - There's nothing to cooking.\\
121 - Mmm. Oh, the coffee's good, too.\\
122 - Where did you learn to do all this?\\
123 - Oh, I'm...\\
124 - just a natural-born cook, I guess.\\
125 - Honey, what kind of a job are you
going to...?\\
126 - What kind of a job are you going to
get?\\
127 - Are you going to go to an employment
office?\\
128 - Lucy, why don't you answer me?\\
129 - That's nice, dear.\\
130 - Okay, I get your message.\\
131 - Now you know what I go through every
morning.\\
132 - All right, I'll reform.\\
133 - Oh. Gee, these fried potatoes\\
134 - are just great.\\
135 - I don't see why you're so surprised.\\
136 - There's nothing to it.\\
137 - (telephone ringing)\\
138 - Well... I'll get it.\\
139 - Hello?\\
140 - Yes?\\
141 - Oh, yes.\\
142 - Oh.\\
143 - Well, thank you very much.\\

146 - Gee, this is a sensational breakfast.\\
147 - My gosh, but you're a good cook.\\
148 - Who was that on the phone?\\
149 - It was the drugstore.\\
150 - You left your hat down there\\
151 - when you picked up these two
breakfast orders.\\
152 - You know, you could have tried to
cook this yourself.\\
153 - We have a dozen eggs in the
refrigerator.\\
154 - Well, um...\\
155 - they didn't turn out quite right.\\
156 - The whole dozen?!\\
157 - Yeah.\\
158 - Oh.\\

197 - Well, why didn't you say so?\\
198 - I have a lot of stenographic jobs
available.\\
199 - Oh, good.\\

201 - Oh, about this fast.\\
202 - Oh, I see.\\

204 - Uh, mine's not as good as hers.\\
205 - No.\\
206 - Look, ladies, let's be honest with
one another.\\
207 - I can't find you a job\\
208 - until you can tell me what you can
really do.\\
209 - Now, what do you do?\\
210 - What kind of jobs do you have open?\\
211 - All right, let's try it another way.\\
212 - I have a list.\\
213 - I will read off the jobs that I have

228 - (whistling)\\
229 - Oh, hiya, Fred.\\
230 - Hi, Rick.\\
231 - Well, don't you look cute.\\
232 - What are you doing\\
233 - with that scarf on top of your head?\\
234 - Oh! Oh, you mean this.\\
235 - I was cleaning the apartment\\
236 - and I didn't want to get any dust in
my hair.\\
237 - Hey, take a tip from me,\\
238 - from an old housewife like me, will
ya,\\
239 - and don't let that iron get too hot.\\
240 - You might scorch something.\\
241 - Really?\\
242 - Yeah.\\
243 - You mean, uh...\\
244 - like this?\\
245 - That's the, uh...\\
246 - That's the general idea, yes.\\
247 - Well, I thought I'd tell Lucy\\
248 - that this was, uh...
an original new design.\\
249 - That story won't work.\\
250 - No, eh? Why not?\\
251 - Ethel has three blouses with that
same design.\\
252 - Listen, you know what's really tough?\\
253 - Silk stockings.\\
254 - Yeah, how about that?\\
255 - They're really tough to iron.\\
256 - You're not supposed to iron silk
stockings.\\
257 - No?\\
258 - No.\\
259 - Fred, anybody knows that.\\
260 - Look, just make sure\\
261 - that you use plenty of starch when
you wash them.\\
262 - Oh.\\
263 - I see.\\
264 - I'll show you.\\
265 - I got a couple of them over here.\\
266 - I'll show you. Here.\\
267 - See?\\
268 - Oh, beautiful.\\
269 - Now, you seen better creases than
that anyplace?\\
270 - My boy, you're a regular Ricky
Margaret McBride.\\
271 - Why, sure, man, sure.\\
272 - Oh, you know something?\\
273 - I been thinking about that dinner,
you know?\\
274 - Yeah?\\
275 - Yeah, I think it's...\\
276 - I think it's silly for both of us to
cook...\\
277 - each one of us to cook a whole meal,
you know?\\
278 - Yeah, yeah.\\
279 - So I thought what we should do is\\
280 - pool our talents, and I'll cook the
main course\\
281 - and you cook the dessert.\\
282 - Okay.\\
283 - Now let's see.\\
284 - How about arroz con pollo?\\
285 - Well, which is that--\\
286 - the main course or the dessert?\\
287 - Chicken and rice.\\
288 - Oh-ho!\\
289 - I seen my mother do it a hundred
times.\\
290 - I love it.\\
291 - Well, listen, I tell you what.\\
292 - Can you bake a cake for dessert?\\
293 - Well, will I--\\
294 - a big juicy one, seven layers thick.\\
295 - Yeah? With frosting?\\
296 - Globs of frosting.\\
297 - (both chuckling)\\
298 - Boy, this is going to be the best
meal\\
299 - our wives ever had.\\
300 - All right, girls, this is the first
stop.\\
301 - Now you understand from your
indoctrination session\\
302 - you're here for one purpose-- to
work.\\
303 - Yes, ma'am.\\
304 - Ricardo, I'm going to put you to work
chocolate dipping.\\
305 - You say you've had experience.\\
306 - Oh, yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.\\
307 - I'm a dipper from way back.\\
308 - Yes?\\
309 - They used to call me the big dipper.\\
310 - Ew.\\
311 - There's no room in this plant\\
312 - for levity, however weak.\\
313 - Yes, ma'am.\\
314 - All right, Ricardo, that's your
place.\\
315 - Mertz, I'm going to put you to work\\
316 - down in the chocolate boxing
department.\\
317 - Follow me.\\
318 - Hey, this is fun.\\
319 - What do you do when your nose itches?\\
320 - Is that so?\\
321 - (fly buzzing)\\
322 - There's a fly in here.\\
323 - (buzzing continues)\\
324 - Hiya, Fred!\\
325 - Hi, Rick.\\
326 - How do you like my new invention?\\
327 - What is it?\\
328 - Well, I can sweep the rug\\
329 - and read the sport pages at the same
time.\\
330 - Pretty clever.\\
331 - Why sure. You know, the only reason
that women claim\\
332 - that housework is so hard\\
333 - is because they don't use their
heads.\\
334 - I guess so.\\
335 - What you got there?\\
336 - Oh, I brought my cake.\\
337 - Oh.\\
338 - Seven layers of luscious devil's
food.\\
339 - Wait till you see it.\\
340 - What happened to the other six
layers?\\
341 - Well, they're all in there.\\
342 - Some of them just didn't rise very
much.\\
343 - Well, you can put on a lot of
frosting.\\
344 - What do you mean, "put on"?\\
345 - The frosting's already in it.\\
346 - In it?\\
347 - Yeah. I mixed it all up together
before I baked the cake.\\
348 - Well, maybe you'd better wait until
breakfast\\
349 - and serve it as a pancake.\\
350 - Oh, never mind, now.\\
351 - How about your part of the meal?\\
352 - Well, it's coming along fine.\\
353 - Good.\\
354 - Yeah. I got the rice cooking.\\
355 - Hey, listen, by the way,\\
356 - what do you know about rice?\\
357 - Well, I had it thrown at me\\
358 - on one of the darkest days of my
life.\\
359 - No, never mind that.\\
360 - I mean how much do you think we
should use\\
361 - for four people?\\
362 - Well, I don't know.
People like that stuff.\\
363 - Well, how does one pound per person
sound?\\
364 - That sounds about right.\\
365 - That's good, because that's what I
put in--\\
366 - four pounds.\\
367 - Good. That's good.\\
368 - Well, let me see.\\
369 - I got the, uh...
I got chickens cooking\\
370 - in the pressure cooker.\\
371 - Yeah.\\
372 - Now, how long do you think they
should take?\\
373 - Oh, I don't know.\\
374 - I'd say about an hour and a half.\\
375 - (explosion)\\
376 - What was that?!
What was that?!\\
377 - Hey, Rick, what was that noise?\\
378 - Why, who took the... oh!\\
379 - Don't burn yourself.\\
380 - Hey, what happened to my chickens?!\\
381 - I had two chickens in there!\\
382 - Well, they got to be here someplace.\\
383 - Chick, chick.
Chick, chick, chick.\\
384 - Chick, chick, chick.\\
385 - Hey.\\
386 - What happened?\\
387 - Are those your birds up there?\\
388 - Yeah.\\
389 - Now what are we going to do?\\
390 - Well, let's wash them off. Come on.\\
391 - All right.\\
392 - Turn the water on.\\
393 - Here's the brush.\\
394 - Give me some of this stuff, here.\\
395 - Give me some more of that stuff over
here.\\
396 - Attaboy.\\
397 - This one's really strong.\\
398 - Hey, Ricky, what's this?!\\
399 - Oh, no!\\
400 - Catch the rice!\\
401 - Hurry up, Fred!\\
402 - Hurry up, will you?!\\
403 - Hurry up, Fred!\\
404 - It's still coming!\\
405 - Hurry up, Fred!\\
406 - Get it! Get it!\\
407 - Get it!\\
408 - It's like a volcano!\\
409 - Get going!\\
410 - I'm going!\\
411 - Fred, here!\\
412 - All right, girls.\\
413 - Listen carefully.\\
414 - This is the wrapping department.\\
415 - Yes, ma'am.\\
416 - Now, the candy will pass by on this
conveyor belt\\
417 - and continue into the next room\\
418 - where the girls will pack it.\\
419 - Now, your job is to take each piece
of candy\\
420 - and wrap it in one of these papers,\\
421 - and then put it back on the belt.\\
422 - You understand?\\
423 - Yes, sir.\\
424 - Yes, ma'am.\\
425 - Let her roll!\\
426 - Let her roll!\\
427 - Well!\\
428 - Wait here.\\
429 - Somebody's asleep at the switch.\\
430 - Whew!\\
431 - What are you doing up here?\\
432 - I thought you were downstairs boxing
chocolates.\\
433 - Oh, they kicked me out of there fast.
Why?\\
434 - I kept pinching them to see what kind
they were.\\
435 - This is the fourth department I've
been in.\\
436 - Oh? I didn't do so well either.\\
437 - All right, girls.\\
438 - Now, this is your last chance.\\
439 - If one piece of candy gets past you\\
440 - and into the packing room unwrapped,
you're fired.\\
441 - Yes, ma'am.\\
442 - Let her roll!\\
443 - Well, this is easier.\\
444 - Yeah. We can handle this okay.\\
445 - Listen...\\
446 - Ethel, I think this...\\
447 - I think we're fighting a losing game.\\
448 - Here she comes.\\
449 - Fine. You're doing splendidly.\\
450 - Speed it up a little!\\
451 - Ricky?\\
452 - Fred?\\
453 - Ricky?\\
454 - I wonder where they are.\\
455 - Lucy, have you got any bicarbonate of
soda?\\
456 - Yeah. I got some in the kitchen.\\
457 - I'll get it.\\
458 - Oh, here's a note.\\
459 - "Dear girls, please do not go in the
kitchen\\
460 - "until we can explain.\\
461 - We'll be back in a few minutes."\\
462 - Gee, I wonder what's in there.\\
463 - I hate to think.\\
464 - You stay here.\\
465 - I'm stronger than you are.\\
466 - (screaming)\\
467 - Oh, Ethel!\\
468 - What is it?\\
469 - Ethel, it's a shambles!\\
470 - Food all over the place--\\
471 - on the floor, on the walls, on the
ceiling--\\
472 - it's a mess.\\
473 - All over-- food.\\
474 - I don't want to clean it up.\\
475 - Oh, no, I can't.\\
476 - Lucy, oh!\\
477 - Oh, Lucy, thank goodness you're home.\\
478 - Something awful happened.\\
479 - No.\\
480 - Yeah, don't go in the kitchen until
Fred and I...\\
481 - I've already been in there.\\
482 - Oh... oh, well.
Don't worry about it.\\
483 - We'll clean it up.\\
484 - Thank you.\\
485 - Listen, we don't know how you girls
feel about it,\\
486 - but we'd like to forget the whole
thing.\\
487 - We're lousy housewives.\\
488 - Hideous.\\
489 - Well, we're not so good\\
490 - at bringing home the bacon either.\\
491 - We got fired off our first job.
Yeah.\\
492 - Well, look, uh... what say we go back
to the way we were?\\
493 - We'll make the money, and you spend
it.\\
494 - Oh, that's great with me.\\
495 - Good idea, Fred.\\
496 - A-And listen, girls,\\
497 - we never realized how tough it was to
run a house before.\\
498 - Aw...\\
499 - So just to show you our appreciation\\
500 - we brought you a little present.\\
501 - Really?
You did?\\
502 - For each one of you\\
503 - a five-pound box of chocolates.\\

5 - ETHEL: Lucy, are you up in the attic?\\
6 - Yeah. Come on up, Ethel.\\
7 - Hi.
Hi.\\
8 - What are you doing up here?\\
9 - Oh, I'm getting this trunk ready.\\
10 - Ricky's going on tour, you know.
Really?\\
11 - Yeah, he's taking the band on the
road for three weeks.\\
12 - Oh.\\
13 - Well, I guess this is big enough for
my clothes.\\
14 - What can I find for Ricky's things
now?\\
15 - Well, I guess this will do.\\
16 - You mean you're going with him?\\
17 - Why, sure. You don't think he'd go
away for three weeks\\
18 - and leave me here all alone, do you?\\
19 - Um, no, I guess not.\\
20 - Besides, what fun could he have on
the road all alone\\
21 - with just the boys in the band?\\
22 - Lucy, when did he ask you to go with
him?\\
23 - Lucy, when did he ask you to go with
him?\\
24 - Lucy...\\
25 - Well, he will!\\
26 - He just hasn't thought of it yet.\\
27 - Oh, look at all the junk in here.\\
28 - Oh, here's that fish that Ricky
caught\\
29 - in Lake Chautauqua.\\
30 - He had it mounted.\\
31 - My, a rainbow sardine.\\
32 - Oh, Ethel, look at this.\\
33 - (laughing)\\
34 - Would you believe that five years ago\\
35 - I wore this on 5th Avenue\\
36 - and I was the hit of the Easter
parade?\\
37 - Oh, you must have been a doll.\\
38 - I was-- a veritable doll.\\
39 - Oh, this was my Greta Garbo period.\\
40 - Oh, no!\\
41 - (laughing)\\
42 - Oh, I had forgotten\\
43 - all about this.\\
44 - What?\\
45 - My saxophone.\\
46 - Your saxophone?\\
47 - My saxophone.\\
48 - I used to play it in the high school
band\\
49 - at Celeron, New York.\\
50 - Oh, no. Not a girl saxophone player
in a band.\\
51 - Well, I had a reason.\\
52 - I was dating a football player\\
53 - and the band got to go on trips with
the team.\\
54 - I did it the hard way.\\
55 - I played left tackle.\\
56 - Come on, play something for me.\\
57 - Play something.\\
58 - (playing "Glow Worm" off-key)\\
59 - I guess I'm a little out of practice.\\
60 - Well, I knew what it was.\\
61 - "Glow Worm"?\\
62 - That's right.\\
63 - Now what do you want to hear?\\
64 - Uh, "Stardust."\\
65 - Okay.\\
66 - (plays "Glow Worm" off-key)\\
67 - Hey... Lucy?\\
68 - Hey, Lucy!\\
69 - Hey!\\
70 - That sounds like "Glow Worm."\\
71 - I know. Everything I play sounds like
"Glow Worm."\\
72 - That's the only piece I ever learned.\\
73 - Well, how'd you play with the band?\\
74 - Well, I used "Glow Worm" for the
audition\\
75 - and then I just marched up and down\\
76 - and puffed my cheeks out and wiggled
my fingers.\\
77 - (no sound)\\
78 - Oh, no.\\
79 - I'll bet I marched a million miles\\
80 - for that stale football player.\\
81 - Well, enough of my grimy amors.\\
82 - I got to get this trunk out of here.\\
83 - I'll get Fred to haul it down for
you.\\
84 - Oh, will you, honey?
Thanks.\\
85 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
86 - How's everything?\\
87 - Oh, everything's wrong, honey.\\
88 - Oh?\\
89 - Yeah, some of the arrangements are
missing,\\
90 - one of the guys got the flu and I got
to replace him\\
91 - and the tailor won't have my tuxedo
ready in time.\\
92 - Oh, that's too bad.\\
93 - He won't have it ready till Friday\\
94 - and we got to leave Wednesday.\\
95 - Would you do me a favor and send it
to me?\\
96 - Send it to you?\\
97 - Yes, please.\\
98 - Well, I wasn't figuring on being
here.\\
99 - Oh? You didn't tell me you were
planning to go out of town, too.\\
100 - You going to visit your mother?\\
101 - No. I was going to visit my husband.\\
102 - Oh?\\
103 - Well, I know it's presumptuous of
me--\\
104 - I'm only your wife--\\
105 - but I kind of expected to go along,
too.\\
106 - Oh, no, honey, now, now, that's
impossible.\\
107 - Why?\\
108 - Well, that's just out of the
question, that's all.\\
109 - Now, I'll write out the address for
you,\\
110 - and you can mail the tuxedo out to
me.\\
111 - I think I will visit my mother--
permanently.\\
112 - Oh, now look, honey, let's not have a
scene.\\
113 - Well, why can't I go along, too?\\
114 - Honey, we're doing one-nighters,
one-night stands.\\
115 - It's a very, very terrible life.\\
116 - You travel all day long.\\
117 - You work all night long.\\
118 - Well, I don't want to stay here all
alone.\\
119 - Look, besides, we're going on a bus.\\
120 - We need every inch of space\\
121 - for the people in the show.\\
122 - Maybe I could lie up on top of the
luggage.\\
123 - Honey, just relax, will you?\\
124 - Here's the address.\\
125 - I got to call some saxophone players.\\
126 - Saxophone players?\\
127 - Hello.\\
128 - Hello, is Ralph Brady there?\\
129 - Will you please tell him to call
Ricky Ricardo\\
130 - when he comes home?\\
131 - Ricky Ricardo.\\
132 - R-i-c-k-y...\\
133 - c, c-- like in "Cuba."\\
134 - No, no, no. Cuba.\\
135 - C-u-b-a.\\
136 - B, B-- like in "barracuda."\\
137 - That's right.\\
138 - Ricky Ricardo.\\
139 - Yeah. Please have him call me, will
you?\\
140 - Thank you very much.\\
141 - (saxophone wailing)\\
142 - (playing "Glow Worm" off-key)\\
143 - Wait a minute, wait a minute.\\
144 - Lucy, what are you doing with that
thing?\\
145 - Well, it's mine.
I used to play\\
146 - in the high school band at Celeron,
New York,\\
147 - and you don't have to look any
further\\
148 - for a saxophone player.\\
149 - Look, honey, even if you could play\\
150 - you couldn't go on the tour.\\
151 - You couldn't travel with a bunch of
men.\\
152 - You wouldn't fit in.\\
153 - You're not one of the boys.\\
154 - What about your harp player, Nancy?\\
155 - She's not going and neither are you.\\
156 - (blows sharp note)\\
157 - Ay-yi-yi.\\
158 - Hello, Ned?\\
159 - Look, Ned, this is Ricky Ricardo.\\
160 - We're having rehearsals tomorrow\\
161 - at 3:00 in the afternoon at the club.\\
162 - I'm trying out some saxophone
players.\\
163 - Could you be down?\\
164 - (playing scales off-key)\\
165 - (playing scales off-key)\\
166 - Hey!\\
167 - Hey!\\
168 - What?\\
169 - Have you seen Ethel?\\
170 - She went shopping, Fred.\\
171 - (resumes playing scales)\\
172 - What are you doing with that
saxophone?\\
173 - I'm practicing.\\
174 - I'm going to audition for Ricky's
band today, you know.\\
175 - Oh. I'm glad I found out it was you
making that noise.\\
176 - I thought there was something wrong
with the plumbing.\\
177 - Oh, Fred, come here a minute.\\
178 - Fred, you used to be around a lot of
musicians\\
179 - when you were in vaudeville, didn't
you?\\
180 - Yeah. Why?\\
181 - Well, the real reason Ricky won't let
me go on tour with him\\
182 - is because he doesn't think I'll fit
in with the musicians.\\
183 - What can I do to show him that I'm
one of the boys?\\
184 - You know, how can I act like a
musician?\\
185 - Well, that's easy.\\
186 - Stay up late, don't eat right, get
circles under your eyes\\
187 - and read nothing but the Racing Form.\\
188 - No. Now Fred, I'm serious.\\
189 - Tell me how to act like one of the
fellas.\\
190 - All right, then, I got to tell you.\\
191 - Now, first you got to dress like
musicians.\\
192 - Oh?\\
193 - They have their own getups.\\
194 - Then you have to speak their
language.\\
195 - They don't talk like human beings.\\
196 - They don't?\\
197 - No. When one musician meets another
musician...\\
198 - (playing swing tune)\\
199 - That's good, Ralph.\\
200 - You got yourself a job.\\
201 - Will you go in the office and make
the deal?\\
202 - Thanks, Rick.\\
203 - You're welcome.\\

247 - That was a crazy A, wasn't it, boys?\\
248 - Let's go. Hit it.\\
249 - One, two...\\
250 - (playing swing tune)\\

252 - (complete silence)\\
253 - RICKY: Lucy...\\
254 - that was supposed to be your solo.\\
255 - Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.\\
256 - How'd I ever miss that?\\
257 - Yeah, well, it was pretty good up
till then, wasn't it?\\
258 - Do I get the job?\\
259 - Well, you know, to tell you the
truth, I can't make up my mind.\\
260 - Oh, well, take your time, man.
Take your time.\\
261 - RICKY: I think we'd better try it

surprise to you\\
271 - after that brilliant audition that
you just gave us...\\
272 - Yeah, dad.\\
273 - ...but, um, you cannot have the job.\\
274 - Ew...\\
275 - When I go on the road, I want you to
stay home\\
276 - and be a good little girl.\\
277 - Yeah, well, I'll stay home.\\
278 - What do you mean by that?\\
279 - Oh, nothing.\\
280 - Hi.\\
281 - Hi.\\
282 - Here's Fred's hat and gloves.\\
283 - Oh, thank you.\\
284 - What'd you want with them?\\
285 - Meet my secret lover.\\
286 - What are you talking about?\\
287 - Well, yesterday down at rehearsal,\\
288 - I got a wonderful idea.\\
289 - You know, I think Ricky would take me
on tour with him\\
290 - if I can convince him of one thing.\\
291 - What?\\
292 - That it isn't safe to leave me at
home.\\
293 - I don't get you.\\
294 - Well, I'm just going to leave these
things lying around,\\
295 - and when Ricky finds them,\\
296 - I'm going to be very flustered\\
297 - and I'm going to be unable to explain
to whom they belong.\\
298 - You mean he'll think you've got a...\\
299 - Uh-huh.\\
300 - (both chortling)\\
301 - Oh, come now, it isn't that funny.\\
302 - You think you're safe?\\
303 - You'd better be careful.\\
304 - You know Ricky's temper.\\
305 - Well, you keep an ear cocked,\\
306 - and if you hear too much commotion,\\
307 - you come up and save me, huh?\\
308 - Okay. I hope I get here on time.\\
309 - Okay.\\
310 - Lucy, I'm home.\\
311 - Oh!\\
312 - Oh, Ricky, you're, you're home so
soon.\\
313 - I didn't expect you to come so soon.\\
314 - I thought you'd call like you usually
do.\\
315 - Oh.\\
316 - I sure wish you'd called.\\
317 - Gee, don't you look nice.\\
318 - Where did you go this afternoon?\\
319 - Oh, nowhere.
Nowhere at all.\\
320 - Well, why are you all dressed up for?\\
321 - No reason, no reason.\\
322 - Oh.\\
323 - Uh... honey, could I have a piece of
the paper?\\
324 - Sure, dear.\\
325 - Thank you.\\
326 - Lucy.\\
327 - Yes, dear?\\
328 - What is this?\\
329 - Oh! Uh, tha...
uh, your hat.\\
330 - I don't remember buying a hat like
this.\\
331 - You sure this is my hat?\\
332 - Yes.\\
333 - Your head must have shrunk.\\
334 - I suppose these are my gloves too.\\
335 - Lucy, who was here this afternoon?\\
336 - No one. No one, really.\\
337 - Lucy... this hat, these gloves...\\
338 - Hey, he must still be here.\\
339 - Where is he?\\
340 - I don't know what you're talking
about.\\
341 - And don't you go in that bedroom.\\
342 - The bedroom! Aha!\\
343 - (stomping)\\
344 - He was in the closet all the time.\\
345 - Lucy, who is he?!\\
346 - I don't know what you're talking
about.\\
347 - My goodness!
If you're going to act like this,\\
348 - I'll be glad to have you away for
three weeks.\\
349 - Now, Lucy, I'm telling you...\\
350 - Hey, what's all the ruckus up here?\\
351 - Fred, I'm glad you're here.\\
352 - Maybe you can calm him down.\\
353 - I've had enough.\\
354 - Well!\\
355 - What's the matter, Rick?\\
356 - Oh, Fred, something awful happened.\\
357 - Well, now, pull yourself together.\\
358 - Pull yourself together and tell me
all about it.\\
359 - Well, I don't know how to tell you
about it.\\
360 - I don't know how to start.\\
361 - I just came home here...\\
362 - What's my hat doing up here?\\
363 - There are more important things.\\
364 - I came home...\\
365 - Did you say your hat?\\
366 - Yeah, it's my old derby.\\
367 - Are you sure?\\
368 - Sure, I'm sure. Look.\\
369 - Feels pretty good.\\
370 - Looks pretty good, too.\\
371 - I think I'll start wearing it again.\\
372 - I suppose these are your gloves, too.\\
373 - Yeah, those are my gloves.\\
374 - It couldn't be him.\\
375 - I wonder why Lucy...\\
376 - Why, the little devil.\\
377 - She wants to make me jealous\\
378 - so I'll take her on that tour with
me.\\
379 - You mean she's pretending\\
380 - that these things belong to another
man?\\
381 - Yeah, not that I believed her for a
minute.\\
382 - Yeah, I could see that when I came
in.\\
383 - How do you like that?\\
384 - She was pretending\\
385 - that this fellow was in the closet
all the...\\
386 - Hey, wait a minute.\\
387 - Wait a minute.\\
388 - What's that gleam in your eye?\\
389 - Oh, I'm going to catch that little
redheaded mouse\\
390 - in her own trap.\\
391 - How?\\
392 - I'm going to get a real guy to come
over here tonight\\
393 - and I'm going to hide him in that
closet\\
394 - and I'm going to say to her,\\
395 - "Someone is hiding in that closet,"\\
396 - and then I will demand that she opens
the door,\\
397 - and when she does,\\
398 - oh, brother, will she be surprised.\\
399 - I'm going to call the musicians
union.\\
400 - I'll bet that Julie will dig up
someone for me.\\
401 - That's a pretty dirty trick.\\
402 - Yeah, I know.\\
403 - She's got it coming to her, though.\\
404 - (ringing)\\
405 - Hello.\\
406 - Hello, Julie.\\
407 - This is Ricky Ricardo.\\
408 - Oh, hello, Ricky. How are you?\\
409 - Fine, thank you.\\
410 - Listen, Julie, will you do me a
favor?\\
411 - I want you to dig up some guy for
me--\\
412 - someone that I don't know.\\
413 - Uh, wait a minute.\\
414 - Make it three or four guys.\\
415 - We might as well do it right.\\
416 - Ricky, I'm sorry you're so upset.\\
417 - I didn't know it had such an awful
effect on you.\\
418 - Not have an effect on me?\\
419 - When my happy home is turned
asoonder?\\
420 - Oh, honey, your happy home is not
turned "asoonder."\\
421 - Look, Ricky, I thought maybe if I
could make you jealous,\\
422 - you'd take me on your trip with you.\\
423 - There isn't anyone else, honey, I
just made that up.\\
424 - No, don't try to make me feel good.\\
425 - I heard that guy come out of that
closet\\
426 - and go out the front door.\\
427 - Now, honey, I did that.\\
428 - Ha!\\
429 - Well, I did.\\
430 - When you went into the bedroom\\
431 - I went over to the closet door, I
opened it, and I slammed it.\\
432 - Then I went to the front door and I
slammed it.\\
433 - That's impossible.\\
434 - All right, it's impossible.\\
435 - It is impossible.\\
436 - It is a physical impossible.\\
437 - What do you want me to do, draw you a
diagram?\\
438 - Look, when you went into the bedroom,\\
439 - I ran over here, I opened the
closet...\\
440 - (screams)\\
441 - Aah!\\
442 - Aah!\\
443 - What's the matter?\\
444 - Nothing, nothing.\\
445 - Uh... nothing.\\
446 - Lucy...\\
447 - there's somebody in that closet now,
isn't there?\\
448 - Oh, no.\\
449 - That's the silliest thing I ever
heard of.\\
450 - (laughing nervously)\\
451 - Lucy, I want to see who's in that
closet.\\
452 - No.\\
453 - No! No! Uh...\\
454 - No.\\
455 - Whoever is in that closet better come
out!\\
456 - It's no use pretending.\\
457 - He caught us.\\
458 - What are you talking about?\\
459 - I never saw this man before in my
life.\\
460 - If you never saw him before in your
life,\\
461 - how come he's in the closet?\\
462 - I don't know.\\
463 - Now, Lucy, I want an answer.\\
464 - Uh... uh...\\
465 - Well?\\
466 - He was giving me saxophone lessons?\\
467 - Lucy, why don't you tell the truth?\\
468 - Yes, Lucy, tell the truth.\\
469 - Oh, shut up!\\
470 - Look, Ricky, if I'd known\\
471 - there was anybody in there,\\
472 - do you think I'd be fool enough to
come over here and...\\
473 - (screaming)\\
474 - Uh...\\
475 - Well?\\
476 - When he gives me saxophone lessons\\
477 - he turns the music.\\
478 - We're going to clear out that closet.\\
479 - There's more?\\
480 - Everybody in that closet come out!\\
481 - (Lucy screaming)\\
482 - Oh, no!\\
483 - I wonder where can she be.\\
484 - She's been gone for two hours.\\
485 - It would serve you right if she never
came back.\\
486 - What a dirty trick.\\
487 - Now, Ethel, it was only a joke.\\
488 - Some joke.\\
489 - She must have been terribly upset\\
490 - to be gone this long.\\
491 - (telephone rings)\\
492 - There she is. Hello!\\
493 - Hello, Ricky, this is Julie.\\
494 - Oh. Hello, Julie.\\
495 - Gee, I should have called you sooner,\\
496 - but I've been trying all over town\\
497 - and it's just no soap.\\
498 - What are you talking about, Julie?\\
499 - Well, I'm sorry, but I couldn't find
anybody\\
500 - to send over there tonight.\\
501 - Well, that's all right. You...\\
502 - Esta metido en el closet!\\

57 - Well, now, suppose you were my
husband\\
58 - and I served you rice for breakfast.\\

61 - The rice is a symbol.\\
62 - It means something.\\
63 - Oh, you want him\\
64 - to stop by the Chinese laundry.\\
65 - No, day after tomorrow is our wedding
anniversary.\\
66 - Oh, the rice is just a subtle
reminder, huh?\\
67 - Mm-hmm, and if the rice doesn't get
to him\\
68 - I have a lot of other things planned.\\
69 - I have the date on the calendar
circled, see?\\
70 - Well, that's subtle.\\
71 - And I left my wedding ring by his
plate.\\
72 - Lucy...\\
73 - did you ever think of saying\\
74 - "Ricky, day after tomorrow is our
wedding anniversary"?\\
75 - Oh, I wouldn't say a thing like that.\\
76 - If he can't think of this by himself\\
77 - I'm just not interested.\\
78 - Well, I can't stay and watch\\
79 - this tender little scene.\\
80 - Let me know how you make out.\\
81 - Okay.\\
82 - Oh, sit down, honey.\\
83 - Breakfast is all ready.\\
84 - Good.\\
85 - Rice.\\
86 - Yeah, rice.\\
87 - Honey, doesn't that rice remind you
of anything?\\
88 - It sure does.\\
89 - Makes me think of when I was a little
boy in Cuba.\\
90 - We used to eat rice for breakfast all
the time.\\
91 - Oh.\\
92 - Sweet of you to think about it,
honey.\\
93 - Oh, that's all right.\\
94 - Honey, what day is it?\\
95 - Saturday, why?\\
96 - Are you sure?\\
97 - Well, now, let me see.\\
98 - Yesterday was Friday.\\
99 - I know tomorrow is Sunday.\\
100 - Friday, Saturday...
Yeah, it's Saturday.\\
101 - Well, I'm not sure.\\
102 - I better check.\\
103 - Yeah, it's Saturday, all right.\\
104 - Well, I'm glad that's settled.\\
105 - Oh, look, there's a big red circle
around Monday.\\
106 - I wonder what that's for.\\
107 - Mm... Monday, huh?\\
108 - Yeah.\\
109 - Can you think of anything important\\
110 - that happens on that day?\\
111 - No.\\
112 - Oh, sure, I know.\\
113 - That's the day they collect the
garbage.\\
114 - Lucy...\\
115 - how many times have I told you\\
116 - not to leave your wedding ring lying
around?\\
117 - Honey, that little ring means a lot
to you, doesn't it?\\
118 - It sure does, honey.\\
119 - Cost me 50 bucks.\\
120 - (humming "Wedding March")\\
121 - I... I got to go down and see Fred.\\
122 - I'll see you later.\\
123 - Hi, Luce.
Hi.\\
124 - Ricky around anyplace?\\
125 - He just went downstairs to see you.\\
126 - Oh, I've been up on the roof\\
127 - checking on the painters.\\
128 - I'll catch him.
Okay.\\
129 - There's nobody down in our apartment.\\
130 - Are you sure he's looking for me?\\
131 - Sure. That's what he said.\\
132 - Well, maybe he's looking for me up on
the roof.\\
133 - Why don't you sit down and have a cup
of coffee?\\
134 - He's got to come back.\\
135 - No, thanks, I'll find him.\\
136 - Okay.\\
137 - (door closes)\\
138 - Did you find Fred?\\
139 - Uh... oh, yeah, yeah, I found him,
yeah.\\
140 - You sure must have had\\
141 - a lot to say to each other.\\
142 - What do you mean?\\
143 - Well, you couldn't have said\\
144 - more than a couple of words.\\
145 - Oh, well, you know\\
146 - he's busy with the painting and the
stuff, you know,\\
147 - so I told him I'd talk to him
tonight.\\
148 - Mm-hmm.\\
149 - See you later.\\
150 - Bye, honey.
Listen, Ricky\\
151 - you know, that isn't the garbage
collection day.\\
152 - No, I wish I could figure out what
that's circled for.\\
153 - Look at that date again.\\
154 - Are you sure that doesn't mean
anything to you?\\
155 - No.\\
156 - No?\\
157 - No.\\
158 - Well, bye.\\
159 - Bye.\\
160 - Hey, Lucy, I can't find that guy
anyplace.\\
161 - Who are you looking for now?\\
162 - Ricky.\\
163 - Ricky? You were just talking to him.\\
164 - I was not.\\
165 - Fred, what's the matter with you?\\
166 - Ricky just went out the front door\\
167 - and said he was talking to you a
minute ago.\\
168 - Just talked to me?\\
169 - Yeah.\\
170 - Well, I better catch him.\\
171 - Why?\\
172 - Because one of us has cracked his
crock.\\
173 - Hi.\\
174 - Ethel, the strangest thing just
happened.\\
175 - What?\\
176 - Well, Ricky just told me he was
downstairs\\
177 - talking to Fred a minute ago, and
Fred was just here\\
178 - and said he hadn't seen Ricky all
morning.\\
179 - No!\\
180 - Yeah, why would Ricky make up\\
181 - a story like that?\\
182 - Where do you suppose he really was?\\
183 - Um... I got to go, Lucy, good-bye.\\
184 - Ethel... what's the matter with you?\\
185 - What do you know?
Look me in the eye.\\
186 - Ethel! Look me in the eye.\\
187 - You know something, don't you?\\
188 - Who, me?\\
189 - No, I don't know anything.\\
190 - Ethel...\\
191 - Now, Lucy...\\
192 - Ethel...\\
193 - If I...\\
194 - Oh, Lucy, I wasn't going to tell you\\
195 - but... I just saw Ricky coming out
of...\\
196 - Now, I know he's got a reason.\\
197 - I know there's a good explanation.\\
198 - But where do you suppose Ricky was\\
199 - when he told you he was downstairs
talking with Fred?\\
200 - Where?\\
201 - In the Fosters' apartment.\\
202 - So what? Why wouldn't he want me to
know\\
203 - he was talking to Bill Foster?\\
204 - Well, there's no reason\\
205 - except that Bill Foster is out of
town.\\
206 - So, Bill Foster's out of town.\\
207 - I still don't why he wouldn't want
me...\\
208 - Bill Foster's out of town?!\\
209 - Now, Lucy, don't jump to conclusions.\\
210 - I'm not. I'm not jumping to
conclusions.\\
211 - I trust Ricky.\\
212 - That's good.\\
213 - If Bill Foster's out of town and
Grace Foster stayed here\\
214 - and Ricky said he was going down to
talk to Fred\\
215 - and he went to Grace Foster's
apartment instead\\
216 - he must have a good, simple logical
explanation for it.\\
217 - Oh, Lucy, you sure are sensible.\\
218 - (wailing)\\
219 - Oh, now, Lucy...
Lucy, don't cry.\\
220 - (wailing gets louder)\\
221 - Oh, Lucy, you got to give Ricky\\
222 - a chance to explain.\\
223 - (wailing)\\
224 - Oh, Lucy, you're much more attractive\\
225 - than Grace Foster.\\
226 - I am?\\
227 - Oh, certainly.\\
228 - You're much prettier than she is.\\
229 - You got a better figure.\\
230 - You got much more personality.\\
231 - As a matter of fact\\
232 - Grace Foster hasn't got anything\\
233 - that you haven't got.\\
234 - She has so.\\
235 - What?\\
236 - She's got Ricky.\\
237 - You'll find your life will begin\\
238 - The very moment you're in Argentina\\
239 - Yeah!\\
240 - If you're romantic, seÃ±or\\
241 - Then you will surely adore Argentina\\
242 - You'll be as gay as can be\\
243 - If you will learn to sing, sing like
a Latino\\
244 - For mister, soon as you learn\\
245 - Then you will never return to
Manhattan\\
246 - When you hear "yo te amo"\\
247 - You'll want a kiss and then...\\
248 - If she should say "maÃ±ana"\\
249 - It's just too late, you know you're
gonna meet again\\
250 - (singing in Spanish)\\
251 - You will never forget Argentina\\
252 - Yeah!\\
253 - For there are rumbas and tangos to
tickle your spine\\
254 - Moonlight and music and orchids and
wine\\
255 - You'll want to stay...\\
256 - Down Argentina way!\\
257 - Yeah!\\
258 - Yeah!\\
259 - Pretty good, pretty good.\\
260 - We... we finished together, for a
change.\\
261 - Hey, watch it, here comes the union.\\
262 - ALL: Allah, Allah, Allah...\\
263 - Hey, Ricky.\\
264 - Hello, Julie.\\
265 - Listen, when I was in the office
before\\
266 - some dame called.\\
267 - She says her name is Grace Foster.\\
268 - What are you whispering about?\\
269 - That's business.\\
270 - Yeah?
Yeah.\\
271 - What kind of business?\\
272 - She says she can't come down to the
club tonight\\
273 - and she wants you to go up to her
apartment.\\
274 - She says she'll phone you\\
275 - when the coast is clear.\\
276 - Well, look, I can't tell you\\
277 - what it's all about, but it is
business.\\
278 - Business, huh?\\
279 - (chuckling)\\
280 - (imitates chuckle)\\
281 - What a character he is.\\
282 - Hey, let's try that intro again, will
you?\\
283 - Hi, Rick.\\
284 - Oh, hiya, Fred.\\
285 - I've been looking for you since
yesterday morning.\\
286 - What did you want?\\
287 - What do you mean what do I want?\\
288 - Well, Lucy told me you wanted to see
me.
What do you want?\\
289 - Oh...\\
290 - (chuckling)\\
291 - I wasn't really looking for you,
Fred.\\
292 - I wanted to go down and see Grace
Foster\\
293 - and I used you as an excuse.\\
294 - Oh, yeah?\\
295 - No, not "Oh, yeah?"\\
296 - Monday is our wedding anniversary.\\
297 - Tomorrow?\\
298 - Yeah.\\
299 - And I want to get Lucy some real
pearls\\
300 - and Grace is gonna get them for me at
a discount.\\
301 - I'm waiting for her to call me right
now.\\
302 - Ah, too bad.\\
303 - I thought maybe something exciting\\
304 - was going to happen around here\\
305 - for once.\\
306 - Lucy thinks that I've forgotten\\
307 - that it's our wedding anniversary,\\
308 - and she's been real grumpy.\\
309 - Yeah, just forget an anniversary and
they grump right up.\\
310 - She won't even speak to me.\\
311 - Oh?\\
312 - That's what I want you to do, Fred.\\
313 - Don't worry, I'll look after it,
Rick.\\
314 - Thank you, old man.\\
315 - Hello, Lucy.\\
316 - Hi, Fred.\\
317 - Well, I'll see you folks later.\\
318 - (phone rings)\\
319 - Hello.\\
320 - Hello, Ricky? This is Grace.\\
321 - Can you talk?\\
322 - Oh, hello, Sam.\\
323 - Yeah, that's right, Sam.\\
324 - Oh... she left the room.\\
325 - I can talk now.\\
326 - I brought home a whole selection of
pearls\\
327 - for you to choose from.\\
328 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
329 - Does Lucy suspect anything yet?\\
330 - No, not a thin'.\\
331 - Oh, it would be terrible\\
332 - if she found out what we're up to.\\
333 - Oh, yeah, it would be awful!\\
334 - Well, don't you worry.\\
335 - I think we got her completely fooled.\\
336 - When can you come down?\\
337 - I'll be down right away.\\
338 - Fine, I'll be waiting.\\
339 - Oh, uh...\\
340 - I got to go down and see Fred.\\
341 - Oh.\\
342 - I'll see you later.\\
343 - Lucy, I came up to see if you'd
like...\\
344 - What's the matter with you?\\
345 - Oh, Ethel, it's all true.\\
346 - I've lost him.\\
347 - What?\\
348 - I listened on the extension.\\
349 - Grace Foster asked him to come down\\
350 - and he flew to her waiting arms.\\
351 - Oh, Lucy!\\
352 - I still can't believe that he chose
her over me.\\
353 - After all, don't 11 years of faithful
service\\
354 - count for anything?\\
355 - Oh, you poor little thing.\\
356 - You'd think if he was going to let me
go like this\\
357 - he'd at least give me a gold watch.\\
358 - Or a letter of recommendation.\\
359 - Gee, Ricky and Grace Foster.\\
360 - I got to see what's going on in that
apartment right now.\\
361 - How can I do it?\\
362 - Gee, that's a tough one.\\
363 - You could... you could hang me by my
heels\\
364 - and lower me out the window.\\
365 - No! It's two floors down!\\
366 - Besides, I might drop you.\\
367 - Oh, yeah.\\
368 - No... no, there's just no way\\
369 - we can see what's going...\\
370 - Hey, wait a minute.\\
371 - Why do we have to see?\\
372 - We still have ears, don't we?\\
373 - The furnace pipe.\\
374 - The furnace pipe!\\
375 - The snooper's friend.\\
376 - Let's go-- come on.\\
377 - Here's a nice set.\\
378 - How do you like these?\\
379 - Oh, these are beautiful.\\
380 - Yeah, I'll take these.\\
381 - Why don't you look at the rest?\\
382 - I've got all these cases full.\\
383 - Oh, all right.\\
384 - Here's one with three strands.\\
385 - I'll just slip them on so you can see
what they look like.\\
386 - Oh, those are real pretty.\\
387 - I'll take those.\\
388 - Oh, wait a minute.\\
389 - We've got lots more to look at.\\
390 - All right.\\
391 - Good old furnace pipe.\\
392 - I can't hear anything.\\
393 - Where can I turn up the volume?\\
394 - WOMAN: Albert!\\
395 - ALBERT: What?\\
396 - Lunch is ready.\\
397 - All right.\\
398 - 4B is coming in good and clear.\\
399 - Where's 2A?\\
400 - Come in, 2A,\\
401 - come in, 2A. Over.\\
402 - RICKY: Stand over here by the window,
Grace\\
403 - so I can see you better.\\
404 - GRACE: Well?\\
405 - That's the most beautiful sight\\
406 - I've ever seen.\\
407 - He always tells me to get away from
the window.\\
408 - He says I'm standing in his light.\\
409 - GRACE: I'd always heard\\
410 - you Cubans were great flatterers.\\
411 - WOMAN: Albert!\\
412 - ALBERT: What?\\
413 - Come and eat your lunch!\\
414 - I'll be there in a minute.\\
415 - RICKY: What do you say, Grace?\\
416 - Let's open up another case.\\
417 - GRACE: Okay.\\
418 - They're up there drinking!\\
419 - You certainly know\\
420 - how to give expensive presents,
Ricky.\\
421 - Oh, well, what's money?\\
422 - After all, these are\\
423 - for the sweetest, most wonderful
woman\\
424 - in the whole world.\\
425 - Oh, what a guy.\\
426 - Grace, you sure have been wonderful\\
427 - and I've finally made up my mind.\\
428 - You have?\\
429 - Yeah, it's a tough choice to have to
make\\
430 - but the one for me is...\\
431 - WOMAN: Albert!\\
432 - Is who? Is who?\\
433 - Albert, are you coming?!\\
434 - I told you I'd be there in a minute!\\
435 - Oh, for heaven's sake, Albert,\\
436 - go eat your lunch!\\
437 - Oh, I can't stand it, Ethel.\\
438 - I can't stand it anymore.\\
439 - I got to see what's going on.\\
440 - Look-- the painters left their
clothes here.\\
441 - They always leave them over the
weekend.\\
442 - Well come on. Why didn't I think of
this before?\\
443 - Get into them!\\
444 - Oh, Grace, I can't make up my mind.\\
445 - Those are real pretty\\
446 - but, you know, these are very pretty,
too.\\
447 - Well, you better look at them both
again.\\
448 - After all, if you're going to spend\\
449 - that much money, you want to be sure.\\
450 - I'll try these on for you.\\
451 - Okay, thank you.\\
452 - What's the matter?\\
453 - Oh, will you help me get these
unfastened, Ricky?\\
454 - Sure.\\
455 - (pounding at door)\\
456 - Hey, hey, there's been an accident!\\
457 - Two guys are in trouble\\
458 - on the painters' scaffolding!\\
459 - Let's see if we can help them!\\
460 - Oh, oh, hold that rope!
Hold the rope!\\
461 - Let's get them in here!\\
462 - Oh, my goodness,\\
463 - they've got the paint all over them
and everything.\\
464 - Watch it there.
Easy.\\
465 - Watch it.
Careful.\\
466 - Careful.\\
467 - Lucy!\\
468 - Lucy?!\\
469 - Holy...\\
470 - Come on, get her in here!\\
471 - Lucy!\\
472 - Oh!\\
473 - Why is she so heavy?\\
474 - FRED: Well, the other guy's hanging
on her feet.\\
475 - Come on in.\\
476 - Come on.\\
477 - Get in.\\
478 - Get the other fella now.\\
479 - Hold it, hold it.\\
480 - I wonder what makes this one so
heavy?\\
481 - Oh, no wonder.\\
482 - Ethel, have you lost your mind?\\
483 - What's the matter with you girls?\\
484 - Are you crazy or something?\\
485 - What's the matter with you? Sit down!
Look at you!\\
486 - Lucy...\\
487 - what were you doing out there?\\
488 - I got a better question.\\
489 - What are you doing in here?\\
490 - What are you doing in Grace Foster's
apartment\\
491 - when her husband's out of town?\\
492 - Uh...\\
493 - Uh...\\
494 - Well, you both got the same story.\\
495 - Now, listen, Lucy...\\
496 - Well, Grace, I guess we might as well
tell her the whole truth.\\
497 - I'm afraid so.\\
498 - Yeah.\\
499 - Lucy...\\
500 - this is going to be a terrible shock
to you.\\
501 - Well?\\
502 - Well, you know Grace works\\
503 - at Joseph Jewelry Company.\\
504 - And you know how valuable pearls are.\\
505 - Real pearls.\\
506 - Well, she took all these pearls from
the store--\\
507 - thousands of dollars' worth.\\
508 - There's enough in there\\
509 - for two people to run away to Mexico\\
510 - and live there for the rest of their
lives.\\
511 - You mean, you and-and...\\
512 - Yes.\\
513 - Grace and I have finally decided\\
514 - that these are the pearls\\
515 - that I should buy you for your
anniversary.\\
516 - Anniversary!\\
517 - Anniversary!\\
518 - Yes!\\
519 - Anniversary!\\
520 - Happy anniversary, Lucy.\\

1 - And now, ladies and gentlemen,\\
2 - if you will observe closely, please,\\
3 - I shall endeavor\\
4 - to make the packet of cigarettes
magically reappear.\\
5 - Hocus...\\
6 - pocus...\\

8 - (whistles)\\
9 - Thank you.\\
10 - Thank you.\\
11 - That's very good.\\
12 - Fine, Fred. That's fine.\\
13 - What a talent.\\
14 - And now, ladies and gentlemen,\\
15 - for my next trick...\\
16 - Oh, not another one.\\
17 - Oh, Fred, you've been on an hour.\\
18 - That's 70 minutes too long.\\
19 - Well, if you're going to take that
attitude\\
20 - I won't show you my next trick.\\
21 - That's Great.
Fine.\\
22 - That's good, Fred, because I got a
lot of work to do...\\
23 - This next demonstration is known\\
24 - as Mystifying Mertz's handcuff
escape.\\
25 - And you're going to have to beg me
before I do it.\\
26 - Oh, please, Fred.\\
27 - Well, well, well, if you're going to
say please,\\
28 - okay, I'll do it.\\
29 - It'll only take a second.\\
30 - You have to be a volunteer from the
audience.\\
31 - This is the most mystifying bit\\
32 - of prestidigitation in my entire
repertoire,\\
33 - and I shall need a volunteer.\\
34 - I'm here.\\
35 - Well, well, there's a very beautiful
young lady.\\
36 - Now I'm going to ask you to look at
these\\
37 - and see that they are securely locked\\
38 - and that it will be impossible for
you to remove them.\\
39 - Very funny.\\
40 - I'm sorry, Fred.\\
41 - I didn't mean to spoil...\\
42 - I'm coming, Houdini.\\
43 - Listen, Ethel, I hope I didn't hurt
his feelings.\\
44 - Hurt his feelings?\\
45 - Listen, I've seen him do those magic
tricks\\
46 - a hundred times.\\
47 - This is the best audience he ever
had.\\
48 - We didn't intend to stay all
afternoon.\\
49 - See you later.\\
50 - That's all right.
Bye-bye, dear.\\
51 - Bye, Ethel.\\
52 - Oh, poor Fred.\\
53 - What do you mean, poor Fred?\\
54 - Poor us.\\
55 - I'm certainly glad they finally left.\\
56 - I got a lot of work to do this
afternoon.\\
57 - You have? I thought you were just
saying that to get rid of Fred.\\
58 - No, I got to learn my part for this
television show.\\
59 - Oh, honey, you've got a lot of time
for that.\\
60 - That doesn't go on till tomorrow.\\
61 - I know, but the rehearsal is tonight.\\
62 - Well, I'll just clean things up
then...\\
63 - Tonight?\\
64 - Yeah.\\
65 - But, Ricky, tonight is Monday.\\
66 - You were going to take me to a movie
and dinner.\\
67 - I was?\\
68 - Well, I didn't tell you about it yet,
but you were.\\
69 - Gee whiz, Ricky, you only get one
night off a week.\\
70 - Well, honey, that's why they're
having the rehearsal tonight--\\
71 - so I can be there.\\
72 - I'm very important to the show.\\
73 - Well, you're very important to me,
too.\\
74 - Gee, I never get to see you anymore.\\
75 - Well, honey, I'll take you to dinner
and a movie\\
76 - some other night, huh.\\
77 - You've been saying that for a long
time.\\
78 - You know how long it's been since
I've seen a movie?\\
79 - How long?\\
80 - Well, I can't remember the title,\\
81 - but there was a guy named Ben that
won a chariot race.\\
82 - I understand they have pictures with
sound now.\\
83 - Never mind that.\\
84 - Well, it makes me mad.\\
85 - We never get to go out together.\\
86 - Well, honey, I promise\\
87 - that I'll keep Mondays for you from
now on.\\
88 - Well, you better.\\
89 - I'll see what Ethel's doing tonight.\\
90 - Okay, honey.\\
91 - Hmm.\\
92 - Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.\\
93 - Hey.\\
94 - What's this? Hey!\\
95 - What happened?\\
96 - (laughing)\\
97 - What are you doing?\\
98 - I'm going to use these on you every
Monday\\
99 - and then you can't get away from me.\\
100 - Oh, honey, you know I'm not trying\\
101 - to find ways to get away from you.\\
102 - I know, and I love you.\\
103 - Well, I love you, too...\\
104 - Oh!\\
105 - How do you get these things off?\\
106 - Well, I'll show you.\\
107 - Hocus-pocus dominocus!\\
108 - Gee, that's funny.\\
109 - When Fred had them on\\
110 - I just jiggled them and they fell
off.\\
111 - Hocus-pocus dominocus!\\
112 - Ooh.\\
113 - Let me try it.\\
114 - Hocus-pocus...
whatever it is.\\
115 - Ow!\\
116 - Gee, Mertz is more mystifying\\
117 - than I thought.\\
118 - I better call him, honey.\\
119 - Whoop!\\
120 - Ow!
Sorry, honey.\\
121 - Fred isn't home-- he went down to the
corner.\\
122 - Ethel and I got these out of his
trunk.\\
123 - Well, come on, let's call Ethel, huh?\\
124 - Yeah.\\
125 - I'll dial.\\
126 - Hey! Hey, Lucy, don't put those...\\
127 - Uh-oh.\\
128 - We're too late.\\
129 - Too late for what?\\
130 - Um...
RICKY: Too late for what?\\
131 - Uh, Fred, uh...\\
132 - Too late for what?
What is it?\\
133 - Those are not the trick handcuffs.\\
134 - What?\\
135 - These are the trick handcuffs.\\
136 - I took them down to the barbershop to
show the boys.\\
137 - Oh, great.\\
138 - Well, any idiot should have seen the
difference.\\
139 - Almost any idiot.\\
140 - Well, isn't there any way you can get
these things unlocked?\\
141 - Sure. You open them with a key.\\
142 - Well, what are you waiting for?
Where's the key?\\
143 - I never had one.\\
144 - Those are old Civil War handcuffs.\\
145 - Civil War?!\\
146 - Civil war?!\\
147 - Have you been saving them ever since
then?\\
148 - Never mind.\\
149 - They were given to me when I did a
police benefit,\\
150 - and that was way back in 1919.\\
151 - Oh, no.\\
152 - Well, genius, what now?\\
153 - Are we going to go through life like
this?\\
154 - Now, honey, remember.\\
155 - When we were married,\\
156 - you wanted to be joined together in
matrimony.\\
157 - And as I recall, it was "till death
do us part."\\
158 - Yeah, that's right.\\
159 - That event is about to take place
right now.\\
160 - Now, Ricky!\\
161 - Hey, hey, wait a minute.\\
162 - We can fix this whole thing with one
phone call.\\
163 - What do you mean?\\
164 - Well, there is such a thing as a
locksmith.\\
165 - Of course.\\
166 - Now wait a minute.\\
167 - I'll do it.\\
168 - I'll get the locksmith.\\
169 - I'll do it!\\
170 - Here, "L".\\
171 - I got him.
I got him.\\
172 - Here they are.
Right there.\\
173 - Here it is.\\
174 - Here's a fellow right near here on
First Avenue.\\
175 - Well, he won't be at the store this
late.\\
176 - Call his home.\\
177 - Well, let's see if they got his...\\
178 - Yeah. Here's his home number.\\
179 - What's the number?\\
180 - Well, I lost my place now.\\
181 - Here. Here it is.\\
182 - Hey, what time is it?\\
183 - 8:30. I got to be down at the
television rehearsal.\\
184 - Don't worry, I'll have him meet us
down there.\\
185 - Oh, no, I'm not going to go down
there like this.\\
186 - I'll just have to call and tell them
I'll be late.\\
187 - Gee, I don't think he's home.\\
188 - Hello? Are you the locksmith?\\
189 - Well, this is Mrs. Ricky Ricardo\\
190 - at 623 East 68th street.\\
191 - Yes. Uh, by accident,\\
192 - my husband and I got handcuffed
together,\\
193 - and we'd like you to come over\\
194 - and take them off for us.\\
195 - No, we didn't escape from jail.\\
196 - It was an...
it was an accident.\\
197 - But wait a minute.\\
198 - That's too late.\\
199 - Wait a minute!\\
200 - Oh.\\
201 - He won't come until morning.\\
202 - Well, never mind.\\
203 - There's a whole page full of
locksmiths here.\\
204 - Here's another character--
Pennsylvania 60599.\\
205 - Look now, Ricky, I can't help it\\
206 - if there isn't a locksmith in New
York City\\
207 - that will come over here tonight.\\
208 - Can't help it.\\
209 - Estas loca completamente.\\
210 - (speaking Spanish)\\
211 - All right, all right, all right!\\
212 - Here. Cut my arm off and go to
rehearsal.\\
213 - Never mind that.
It's too late.\\
214 - Let's go to bed.\\
215 - Come on.
All right.\\
216 - I'm sorry.\\
217 - Well, look, now let's not lose our
tempers.\\
218 - Let's get organized.\\
219 - Now, first, let's get undressed.\\
220 - Okay. All right.
All right.\\
221 - After you.\\
222 - Thank you.\\
223 - Well, it takes women a little longer\\
224 - to get undressed.\\
225 - Well?\\
226 - Well, now, there must be a way out of
this.\\
227 - Now just a minute.\\
228 - Come here.\\
229 - Wait a minute!\\
230 - That's a new suit.\\
231 - Well, it's either that\\
232 - or we're going to have to sleep in
our clothes all night.\\
233 - Well, then, we'll have to sleep in
our clothes all night.\\
234 - I'm not going to ruin a new suit.\\
235 - Okay.\\
236 - Now let me see.\\
237 - Well...\\
238 - let's at least take our shoes off,
huh?\\
239 - All right.\\
240 - Ah! Don't tickle my feet!\\
241 - I didn't mean...\\
242 - Okay?\\
243 - Yeah.\\
244 - Let's go to bed.\\
245 - Oh, Ricky!\\
246 - Cut it out, will you?\\
247 - Well, you did it, too.\\
248 - All right, wait a minute, wait a
minute.\\
249 - Let me figure it out.\\
250 - Now let's turn around.\\
251 - Let's turn around.\\
252 - No, not there.\\
253 - Turn over here\\
254 - and climb into bed from the end.\\
255 - No. That's no good.\\
256 - Then we'll be on the wrong side.\\
257 - I want to sleep where I usually do.\\
258 - All right. Crawl around.\\
259 - There you are.\\
260 - (grunting)\\
261 - Oh...\\
262 - Good night, dear.\\
263 - Good night, honey.\\
264 - Ricky?\\
265 - What?\\
266 - I can't sleep on my back.\\
267 - Well, try it!\\
268 - All right.\\
269 - No, I can't do it.\\
270 - Let's trade places.\\
271 - Okay.\\
272 - Well, you come around this way.\\
273 - I'll go around the other way.\\
274 - There we are.\\
275 - Ah, good night, dear.\\
276 - Good night.\\
277 - Ricky?\\
278 - What?\\
279 - I can't sleep this way either.\\
280 - Why not?\\
281 - Because I want to sleep\\
282 - in my own bed and on my stomach.\\
283 - That's impossible.\\
284 - Well, you're doing it.\\
285 - What are you talking about?\\
286 - Well, if there was only some way\\
287 - we could get on the other side of
each other.\\
288 - Come here, I think I can figure it
out.\\
289 - Wait a minute, let me put the light
on.\\
290 - Now, look...
Yeah?\\
291 - Now just stand here a minute.\\
292 - Now let me figure something out.\\
293 - Yeah.\\
294 - Yeah. Yeah, that will do it.\\
295 - Now hold still.\\
296 - All right.\\
297 - Hey, wait a minute!\\
298 - Now wait.\\
299 - Hey!\\
300 - What are you doing?\\
301 - Wait!\\
302 - No!\\
303 - I'll give you five dollars\\
304 - if you can get out of this one.\\
305 - What are you doing?\\
306 - There. Look. See?\\
307 - See? I'm here.\\
308 - That's just the right way\\
309 - that we started from.\\
310 - You were there, and I was here.\\
311 - Now let me get it straight.\\
312 - You want to sleep on your stomach in
your bed.\\
313 - Right.\\
314 - Right? Okay.\\
315 - Oye, que pesada estas.\\
316 - Eleven years marriage, 22 pounds.\\
317 - Oh!\\
318 - There.\\
319 - Ow!\\
320 - There you are.\\
321 - Lucy, are you up yet?\\
322 - LUCY: I'll be right there.\\
323 - Just sit down, Mr. Walters.\\
324 - They'll be here in just a minute.\\
325 - All righty.\\
326 - My goodness!\\
327 - This is Mr. Walters, the locksmith.\\
328 - Mr. Walters, Mr. And Mrs. Ricardo.\\
329 - How do you do?\\
330 - Uh, well...\\
331 - I'm certainly glad to see you.\\
332 - Yes, I imagine you are.\\
333 - My, my, that is an old pair, all
right.\\
334 - They don't make them anymore, you
know.\\
335 - Yeah, we know, we know.\\
336 - What museum did you steal them from?\\
337 - Uh, Mr. Walters,\\
338 - you can get them off, can't you?\\
339 - Oh, yes, I think so, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
340 - I, uh...\\
341 - Ricardo?\\
342 - Say, you any relation to that
bandleader\\
343 - that Ricky Ricardo?\\
344 - Yes. He's a close relative-- very
close.\\
345 - Oh, I recognize you now.\\
346 - You are Ricky Ricardo, aren't you?\\
347 - Yeah, that's right.\\
348 - Well, imagine that.\\
349 - Me and the missus\\
350 - went to your Tipicany Nightclub\\
351 - on our 40th wedding anniversary.\\
352 - Saw you do that thing with the drum--\\
353 - that, uh... that, uh...
Bobolink number.\\
354 - "Babaloo."\\
355 - Yeah, that's what I said.\\
356 - Oh, say, wait till I tell the missus.\\
357 - She'll never believe me.\\
358 - Look, would you give me your
autograph\\
359 - so that she'll know that I was here?\\
360 - Just make it out to Abigail.\\
361 - Abigail?
Abigail, yes.\\
362 - Oh, she buys all your records.\\
363 - She's played that Bobolink number\\
364 - a million times, I'll bet you.\\
365 - Told her I was going to get her a
drum for Christmas.\\
366 - Sweet, sweet.\\
367 - Oh, she likes you.\\
368 - Sweet, sweet.\\
369 - She would rather hear...\\
370 - Uh, Mr. Walters, the handcuffs?\\
371 - Oh. Oh, yes, yes.\\
372 - You know, I'm probably the only
locksmith in America\\
373 - that has a key to fit these.\\
374 - Yes, sir.\\
375 - Now, let's see here.\\
376 - See what we got.\\
377 - Uh-huh.\\
378 - You know, I always had a hankering
for show business.\\
379 - No.\\
380 - Won an amateur dance contest once.\\
381 - No.\\
382 - My friends all said\\
383 - that I'd make another Freddie
Astaire.\\
384 - No.\\
385 - But what with one thing and another\\
386 - I finally drifted into the locksmith
game.\\
387 - No.\\
388 - But I always figured\\
389 - that I missed my real calling.\\
390 - No.\\
391 - But who knows.\\
392 - What with...\\
393 - one of these days with television and
all\\
394 - I may still get my real break.\\
395 - No.\\
396 - None of these fit.\\
397 - Look, couldn't you file them off?\\
398 - Oh, no.
That's tempered steel.\\
399 - You wouldn't want to go through that,
son.\\
400 - Say, I'll tell you what.\\
401 - I got a collection of real old
handcuff keys at home--\\
402 - the only one in existence.\\
403 - My grandfather started me on it.\\
404 - Yes, grandy used to say, "Son..."\\
405 - He called me son even though I was
his grandson, and...\\
406 - Oh, um... I'll dash on home.\\
407 - How long will it take?\\
408 - Oh, I can easily make it in two
hours.\\
409 - Two hours?!
Two hours?!\\
410 - Where do you live?\\
411 - Yonkers.\\
412 - Oh, I wonder where that locksmith
could be.\\
413 - He's been gone five hours.\\
414 - He would be the only one with the
key.\\
415 - Well, he'd better hurry up.\\
416 - I'm going to miss the television show
now.\\
417 - (telephone ringing)\\
418 - Come on.\\
419 - Hello? Mr. Walters?\\
420 - Well, what happened?
What happened?\\
421 - Oh, no!\\
422 - What happened?\\
423 - Well, look, Mr. Walters, don't come
to the apartment.\\
424 - What happened?
Wait a minute, will you.\\
425 - Mr. Walters, don't come to the
apartment.\\
426 - No. Look, go to Television Center,
Studio A.\\
427 - Studio A.\\
428 - Meet us there right away, please.\\
429 - I'm on the air in one hour.\\
430 - Don't forget now.\\
431 - Better be there.
All right, good-bye.\\
432 - What happened?\\
433 - He had a little trouble getting the
key\\
434 - and guess why.
Why?\\
435 - He locked himself out of his house.\\
436 - Oh.\\
437 - Come on, will you?\\
438 - Oh, honey!\\
439 - Sorry.\\
440 - Wait a minute.
Oh.\\
441 - How you doing?\\
442 - I haven't made a dent.\\
443 - Oh. I hope the locksmith gets here
quick.\\
444 - Does the producer know about these
handcuffs?\\
445 - Nobody saw you come in.\\
446 - (knocking)
Yeah?\\
447 - MAN: Mr. Ricardo, you're on in two
minutes.\\
448 - Oh, we might as well tell him.\\
449 - We'll never make it in time.\\
450 - Oh, you can't do that.
The producer will kill me.\\
451 - You'll never work this show again.\\
452 - Well, I don't care if I ever work
this show again.\\
453 - You don't think I'm going to go on
television\\
454 - handcuffed to her, do you?\\
455 - As your agent, I say go on.\\
456 - Well, as myself, I say no.\\
457 - Do I get a vote?\\
458 - No!
No!\\
459 - All right.\\
460 - Are you going to cancel, or shall I?\\
461 - You cancel your 90%.\\
462 - My 10% goes on.\\
463 - You might as well go on, Ricky.\\
464 - They'll find out why you're
canceling.\\
465 - It'll be in the papers.
Oh...\\
466 - Get on stage, Mr. Ricardo.\\
467 - All right, all right, we're coming.\\
468 - Well, come on, will you?\\
469 - I got a wife and two kids.\\
470 - All right, come on.\\
471 - Come on, honey.\\
472 - Now, listen.\\
473 - You stand behind me as much as you
can.\\

\subsection {Episode 05: The Operetta}
1 - We had a wonderful time.\\
2 - We had such a grand time.\\
3 - Good night.\\
4 - It's so nice to have met you.\\
5 - What a wonderful evening.\\
6 - Lucy.\\
7 - Oh, Lucy, this has been\\
8 - a most momentous club meeting,\\
9 - just too, too, really.\\
10 - (all exclaiming)\\
11 - Bye, Lucy.\\
12 - Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.\\
13 - Bye-bye.\\
14 - I will let you know all about it,
dear...\\
15 - Oh, okay, dear.
Bye-bye.\\
16 - just as soon as I can.\\
17 - Yes. Bye-bye.\\
18 - (sighs)\\
19 - Hi. Oh, is the club meeting over?\\
20 - Yeah. They just left.\\
21 - Oh, darn it. I thought I'd get home
on time.\\
22 - What happened?\\
23 - The roof fell in on me.\\
24 - What do you mean?\\
25 - Oh, Ethel, it's just terrible.\\
26 - The club voted to use the money in
the treasury\\
27 - to put on an operetta on the 25th\\
28 - and I'm supposed to be in charge.\\
29 - So what?\\
30 - Well, there isn't enough money in the
treasury.\\
31 - Well, you're the treasurer of the
club--\\
32 - you ought to know.
How much is there?\\
33 - The books say $246.\\
34 - Well?\\
35 - Well, about a year and a half ago\\
36 - Ricky wanted to go over my household
account,\\
37 - and I was ten dollars short.\\
38 - So?\\
39 - Well, I borrowed ten dollars from the
club treasury\\
40 - so that my household account would
balance.\\
41 - Well, ten dollars.\\
42 - That was only the beginning.\\
43 - From then on, I borrowed from the
household account\\
44 - so that the treasury account would
balance,\\
45 - and then I borrowed from the treasury\\
46 - so the household account would
balance,\\
47 - and on and on and back and forth like
a tennis game,\\
48 - and somewhere along the line, I lost
the ball.\\
49 - What do you mean?\\
50 - Now there's no money in either
account.\\
51 - Oh, my goodness, you are in a spot.\\
52 - What are you going to do?\\
53 - Well, I was going to pay back the
treasury\\
54 - with my household money,\\
55 - but Ricky doesn't give it to me\\
56 - until the first of the month.\\
57 - And you need the money on the 25th.\\
58 - Gee, I'm worried.\\
59 - You know how fat I look in stripes.\\
60 - Why don't you ask Ricky to advance
you the money?\\
61 - Oh, I thought of that.\\
62 - I don't look good in black and blue
either.\\
63 - You'd better start thinking.\\
64 - Well, I've got one last desperate
idea.\\
65 - What is it?\\
66 - Well, we can save the royalty fee--
that's $100--\\
67 - if we write the operetta ourselves.\\
68 - Wait a minute.
And then...\\
69 - We could save the royalty fee?\\
70 - Who is "we"?\\
71 - "We" is Ethel Romberg and Lucy Friml.\\
72 - That's who "we" is.\\
73 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
74 - Just forget all about me.\\
75 - Oh, all right, I'll just have to get
someone else\\
76 - to sing the lead.\\
77 - The lead?\\
78 - Yeah. That's all right, though.\\
79 - I can find someone else.\\
80 - Oh. The lead, huh?\\
81 - Who could possibly do it but you?\\
82 - Now the next thing we have to do is
get\\
83 - someone to sing the male lead for
nothing.\\
84 - Who?\\
85 - Who else but John Charles Ricardo?\\
86 - (humming)\\
87 - (continues humming tune)\\
88 - Hi, Lucy.\\
89 - Hi.
Sorry I'm late.\\
90 - That's okay.
I got the story pretty well along.\\
91 - You want to hear it?\\
92 - Sure.\\
93 - It's called The Pleasant Peasant.\\
94 - She's really a princess in disguise.\\
95 - That's my part, huh?\\
96 - Oh, well, I kind of wanted to talk to
you about that, Ethel.\\
97 - Now, Lucy, you said nobody could
possibly sing the lead but me.\\
98 - But now look, If Ricky's going to do
the male lead\\
99 - it's only logical that I sing the
female lead.\\
100 - Oh...
Besides, I have a much better part
for you.\\
101 - What?\\
102 - Camille.\\
103 - Camille?\\
104 - Yeah, Camille-- the snaggletooth old
queen of the gypsies.\\
105 - Oh, no. Now, Lucy...\\
106 - Now, Ethel, give me one good reason\\
107 - why you should do the female lead
instead of me.\\
108 - You can't carry a tune.\\
109 - Well!\\
110 - If you're going to get petty about
it.\\
111 - All right, we'll audition right now.\\
112 - I'll go first.\\
113 - Get over.\\
114 - (playing scale)\\
115 - (clearing throat)\\
116 - Mi.\\
117 - (singing scale)\\
118 - (singing higher scale)\\
119 - (sustaining high note)\\
120 - Now you.\\
121 - (singing off-key:)
Mi.\\
122 - (wailing)\\
123 - I been working on the railroad\\
124 - All the livelong day.\\
125 - Where do I go to get my teeth
snaggled?\\
126 - Good girl.\\
127 - Now let's hear the story of the
operetta.\\
128 - Well, we open on the outside of the
inn,\\
129 - and there's dancing on the green.\\
130 - And then Squire Quinn-- that's Fred--
comes out of the inn.\\
131 - His inn is on the River Out.\\
132 - And then you come on and you sing a
song\\
133 - about nobody being in love with you.\\
134 - Then the queen of the gypsies comes
on--\\
135 - that's me, I guess--\\
136 - and predicts that you're going to
fall in love\\
137 - with a prince and be married,\\
138 - but it will come to a terrible
tragedy.\\
139 - Then Ricky comes in-- he's the
prince--\\
140 - and he takes one look at you and
falls madly in love with you.\\
141 - That'll take a little acting.\\
142 - Never mind.\\
143 - Well, anyway, they have the wedding,\\
144 - and then, like the gypsy predicted,
tragedy strikes.\\
145 - On the way to the prince's castle,\\
146 - the band of highwaymen hit the prince
on the head, kidnap you\\
147 - and take you to their cave in the
forest.\\
148 - Now, the reason the highwaymen
kidnapped the peasant girl\\
149 - is that the wicked witch has turned
the leader into a frog.\\
150 - Huh?
Yeah.\\
151 - The leader of the highwaymen is the
princess' brother\\
152 - who was separated from her when they
were tadpoles.\\
153 - But she doesn't know this, see.\\
154 - And that's the end of the first act.\\
155 - The first act?
Yeah.\\
156 - How many scenes are there in that?\\
157 - Only 18.\\
158 - Eighteen?!\\
159 - That will take a lot of scenery,
won't it?\\
160 - Now, don't get excited.\\
161 - I've already rented the scenery and
the costumes.\\
162 - But don't you have to pay for that
stuff in advance?\\
163 - Sure, I gave them a check on the club
treasury.\\
164 - But there's no money\\
165 - in the club treasury account.\\
166 - You don't give me credit for
anything.\\
167 - I dated the check the day after the
show.\\
168 - By that time there will be a lot of
money in the bank.\\
169 - Oh, dear.\\
170 - Want to hear the rest of the story?\\
171 - Why not?\\
172 - Now, in the meantime,\\
173 - the prince, who thinks he's a peasant\\
174 - but he's really a frog, you know,\\
175 - is working for Squire Quinn at the
inn,\\
176 - and the only way...\\
177 - (piano playing)\\
178 - I am the good Prince Lancelot\\
179 - I love to sing and dance a lot\\
180 - I have an eye for a da-da-da...\\
181 - None of that "da-da-da" stuff.\\
182 - Let's hear the words.\\
183 - They're good words; let's hear them.\\
184 - Good words?\\
185 - "Lancelot..."\\
186 - "dance a lot."\\
187 - Who wrote this operetta anyway?\\
188 - Who wrote it?\\
189 - Did you ever hear of Victor Herbert?\\
190 - Well, sure.\\
191 - Well, all right then.\\
192 - Go ahead.\\
193 - I am the good Prince Lancelot\\
194 - I love to sing...\\
195 - Say, Lucy, does this costume look
right to you?\\
196 - Is that what they sent over?\\
197 - Well, there's a lot of stuff
downstairs,\\
198 - but I can't figure it out.\\
199 - Oh, I'll just have to go down and
check.\\
200 - I have to do everything around here.\\
201 - Come on, I'll take care of it.\\
202 - You two keep on your rehearsing.\\
203 - Come on now.
Don't stop.\\
204 - Yes, Mrs. De Mille.\\
205 - (piano playing)\\
206 - Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Ethel.\\
207 - I want to talk to you about
something.\\
208 - What?\\
209 - Well, look, honey, I, I...\\
210 - You know I love Lucy, and she's a
wonderful girl\\
211 - and she's got wonderful qualities,\\
212 - but, uh, confidentially...\\
213 - when she sings, she hits a bad note
once in a while.\\
214 - Once in a while?\\
215 - Oh, you've noticed.\\
216 - Well, what are we going to do about
it?\\
217 - You don't have to worry about it.\\
218 - I've already taken care of it.\\
219 - I talked to the women, and she isn't
going to get a chance to sing by
herself.\\
220 - Every time she opens her mouth, the
entire cast will join in.\\
221 - I am the good Prince Lancelot...\\
222 - (audience applauding)\\
223 - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,\\
224 - and welcome\\
225 - to the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts
League production\\
226 - of The Pleasant Peasant.\\
227 - I can't come out in front of the
curtain\\
228 - because I have my costume on.\\
229 - Overture, maestro, please.\\
230 - (piano playing)\\
231 - We're the pleasant peasant girls\\
232 - Happy pleasant peasant girls\\
233 - We're so happy we could fly\\
234 - With an H-A-P-P-Y\\
235 - We're the pleasant peasant girls\\
236 - Happy pleasant peasant girls\\
237 - With a happy mom and a happy pappy\\

240 - Girls.\\
241 - Oh... what do we do today?\\
242 - Let's have a picnic down by the River
Out.\\
243 - Oh, that's a lovely idea.\\
244 - Oh, wonderful.\\
245 - Look, there is Squire Quinn.\\
246 - Well, well, good morning, girls.\\
247 - Good morning.\\
248 - Good morning, Squire Quinn.\\
249 - There, there, there.\\
250 - Well, what a bunch of pleasant
peasants you are.\\
251 - (piano playing)\\
252 - I'm the good Squire Quinn\\
253 - And I wanna shout\\
254 - About my inn on the River Out\\
255 - You can easily see the shape Squire
Quinn is in\\
256 - But wait till you see the shape his
inn is in\\
257 - The rooms are lovely and full of
space\\
258 - There's running water in every place\\
259 - Yes, and lots of water if you can
stay Long enough for a rainy day\\
260 - Every room has a beautiful view\\
261 - Of sailing boats on the river blue\\
262 - You can watch the boats when the wind
blows\\
263 - But the squire didn't put in windows\\
264 - Lots of ale and stout are on my shelf\\
265 - And I take a drop or two myself\\
266 - A drop, he says, the squire's got the
gout\\
267 - The stout makes him ail\\
268 - And the ale makes him stout\\
269 - So ends my story, and I think that
this'll\\
270 - Be a good time to wet my whistle\\
271 - That's all there is, and it leaves no
doubt\\
272 - That the squire's in his inn\\
273 - And his inn's on the Out.\\
274 - Well, well, good-bye, girls.\\
275 - I've got to go now and polish off a
few tankards.\\
276 - WOMEN: Good-bye!\\
277 - Good-bye, girls.\\
278 - Good-bye! Good-bye!\\
279 - Look. Look who's coming yonder.\\

281 - from the next village.\\

285 - Of the valley\\
286 - Of the quiet, peaceful valley over
there\\
287 - And I'm lonely\\
288 - Oh, so lonely\\
289 - And nobody in the valley seems to
care\\
290 - When other girls go walking\\
291 - On their arms they have a swell beau\\
292 - But whenever I go walking\\
293 - On my arm is just my elbow\\
294 - And I'm looking\\
295 - Always looking\\
296 - For my dream man\\
297 - And I guess I always will\\
298 - I know a girl's supposed to wait\\
299 - For a prince to come and get her\\
300 - The only prince I ever met\\
301 - Is a neighbor's Irish setter\\
302 - So, if by any chance\\
303 - You see\\
304 - A prince who has a plan for me\\
305 - Tell him not to dilly-dally\\

1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Morning, Lucy.\\
3 - (thudding)\\
4 - ETHEL: Oh, hey!\\
5 - I'll be right there, Ethel.\\
6 - What did you lock the door for?\\
7 - I almost broke my neck.\\
8 - I just wanted to see what would
happen\\
9 - if I did something different for a
change.\\
10 - What are you talking about?\\
11 - Life.\\
12 - I've just been thinking about life.\\
13 - Ethel, Ricky and I are in a terrible
rut.\\
14 - What do you mean?\\
15 - Everything has become routine.\\
16 - We do the same dull thing every day.\\
17 - We see the same dull people.\\
18 - Thanks a lot.\\
19 - I didn't mean you.\\
20 - It's just that nothing new ever
happens.\\
21 - Why, I can tell everything Ricky's
going to say and do\\
22 - before he does it.\\
23 - Ah, can you?\\
24 - Wait till he wakes up.
You'll see.\\
25 - He'll call, "Hey, Lucy, is the coffee
percolated yet?"\\
26 - Then he'll come into the kitchen half
asleep\\
27 - looking like a zombie...\\
28 - stagger over to the stove...\\
29 - say, "Oh, I could have slept all
day..."\\
30 - scratch his leg while he pours some
coffee for himself...\\
31 - kiss the air in my general
direction...\\
32 - stagger off into the bedroom.\\
33 - It isn't funny, Ethel.\\
34 - It's tragic.\\
35 - I know it is.\\
36 - You know, I just realized\\
37 - I can do exactly the same thing with
Fred.\\
38 - I'll bet you can.\\
39 - Right now\\
40 - he's sitting down with the morning
paper\\
41 - to do the crossword puzzle.\\
42 - So he'll call to me...\\
43 - FRED: Ethel!\\
44 - He hasn't varied five minutes in 22
years.\\
45 - I'm up here, Fred!\\
46 - He won't find his glasses up here.\\
47 - Oh, yes, he will.\\
48 - They'll be on top of his head.\\
49 - You're kidding.\\
50 - And when I tell him, he'll say\\
51 - "Hmm. If they'd been a snake,\\
52 - they'd a bit me."\\
53 - He hasn't been saying the same thing\\
54 - for 22 years?\\
55 - 22...\\
56 - Hi.\\
57 - Well, you're in a jolly mood this
morning.\\
58 - Ethel, have you seen\\
59 - my glasses?\\
60 - Well, it must be hilarious\\
61 - that I can't read without my glasses.\\
62 - Oh, it's not that, Fred.\\
63 - It's just that...\\
64 - What a sense of humor.\\
65 - I'll go break my leg and give you a
real laugh.\\
66 - Ah, wait a minute, Fred.\\
67 - Your glasses are on top of your head.\\
68 - Huh? Well, how do you like that?\\
69 - If they'd been a snake, they'd a bit
me.\\
70 - RICKY: Lucy!\\
71 - Lucy, is the coffee percolated yet?\\
72 - I could have slept all day.\\
73 - (kissing sound)\\
74 - It's fantastic, Lucy.\\
75 - Ricky and Fred are cut out of the
same mold.\\
76 - Yeah, and they're getting moldier all
the time.\\
77 - What are we going to do about them?\\
78 - Them? What about us?
We're just as bad as they are.\\
79 - We've all let ourselves become four
big, dull clunks.\\
80 - You know, I think you're right.\\
81 - Sure, I'm right.\\
82 - And tonight, instead of playing
canasta,\\
83 - we're going to sit down\\
84 - and figure out the quickest way to
de-clunk ourselves.\\
85 - Do you all realize that we're in a
terrible rut?\\
86 - In a rut?\\
87 - What are you talking about?\\
88 - The four of us have allowed ourselves\\
89 - to deteriorate.\\
90 - Yeah.\\
91 - We have become stuffy, moldy, and
musty.\\
92 - We are knee-deep in a pool of
stagnation.\\
93 - Now, what are we going to do about
it?\\
94 - Well, I don't know about the rest of
you,\\
95 - but I'm going to go and take a
shower.\\
96 - Never mind being funny.\\
97 - Now, sit down.\\
98 - We're serious.\\
99 - We certainly are.\\
100 - Our lives have become a stale
routine.\\
101 - We do the same thing in the same way.\\
102 - We know each other like a book.\\
103 - Well, honey, that's only normal.\\
104 - After you're married for 11 years,\\
105 - you're supposed to know each other
like a book.\\
106 - It's the same after 25 years,\\
107 - only the cover gets more dog-eared.\\
108 - Listen, the kind of routine we're in
is not normal.\\
109 - Now, Ethel and I went down to the
library this afternoon\\
110 - and we found a lot of books\\
111 - on the subject.\\
112 - And?\\
113 - And the books all agree.\\
114 - This one states it as well as any.\\
115 - "There are times when married couples\\
116 - let their lives fall into set
patterns."\\
117 - That's exactly what's happened to us.\\
118 - Right.\\
119 - "The only thing to do in a case like
this\\
120 - "is for the marital partners\\
121 - to spend some time away from each
other."\\
122 - What?\\
123 - Please.\\
124 - "Change your whole way of living.\\
125 - "Take a week's vacation from marriage\\
126 - "and don't even see your husband or
wife.\\
127 - "Vacation from marriage\\
128 - will give you both a whole new
perspective."\\
129 - So?\\
130 - So Ethel and I are going to spend a
week away\\
131 - from you and Fred.\\
132 - You mean I won't see you for a whole
week?\\
133 - That's right.\\
134 - And you won't see me\\
135 - for a whole week, Fred.\\
136 - Well, I'll make the sacrifice.\\
137 - Come on.
Are you crazy or something?\\
138 - What are you going to do, leave town?\\
139 - No, not necessarily.\\
140 - I'll go downstairs and live with
Ethel.\\
141 - Fred can come up here and live with
you,\\
142 - and we'll just lead our own lives.\\
143 - We just won't see each other, that's
all.\\
144 - Isn't this going to be fun?\\
145 - We can sleep as late as we want to\\
146 - go shopping, call up our old
girlfriends.\\
147 - Yeah, we'll be just a couple of
bachelor girls.\\
148 - I don't like the sound of this whole
thing.\\
149 - Now, wait a minute, Rick.\\
150 - You don't understand.\\
151 - If they're going to be bachelor
girls,\\
152 - we're bachelor boys.\\
153 - Hey, that's right.\\
154 - You might have something at that in
there.\\
155 - Yeah.\\
156 - Well, good-bye, Fred.\\
157 - Good-bye, Ethel.\\
158 - Good-bye, Ricky.\\
159 - Good-bye.
I'll be seeing you.\\
160 - Well, Lucy, what do we do tonight?\\
161 - Oh, I don't care.\\
162 - What do you want to do?\\
163 - How about going to a movie?\\
164 - Again? We've been to five movies
already this week.\\
165 - Well, it's Saturday night\\
166 - and I don't feel like staying home.\\
167 - Well, neither do I.\\
168 - Maybe we can call somebody.\\
169 - Who?\\
170 - We called up all our old girlfriends.\\
171 - They're all married.\\
172 - Yeah.\\
173 - They'll all be with their husbands\\
174 - on Saturday night.\\
175 - Yeah, they're all in that awful rut
we used to be in.\\
176 - Yeah.\\
177 - They don't know what fun it is\\
178 - to be on their own like us.\\
179 - Yippee.\\
180 - Ethel...\\
181 - Huh?\\
182 - Well, nothing personal, but...\\
183 - I'm sick of the sight of your face.\\
184 - Well, you should try it from out here
looking at yours.\\
185 - If you think this has been any...\\
186 - All right, all right.\\
187 - Let's not fight among ourselves.\\
188 - We're all we've got.\\
189 - How true.\\
190 - Gee, I wonder what the boys are doing
tonight.\\
191 - I wonder.\\
192 - Ethel, let's swallow our pride\\
193 - and go up and admit that we miss the
big dopes.\\
194 - Oh, no, Lucy.\\
195 - They'd never let us hear the end of
it.\\
196 - No?\\
197 - I know what we should do.\\
198 - What?\\
199 - We should get all dressed up\\
200 - like we're going out on a mad date,\\
201 - and then we should go up and I should
say\\
202 - that I want to get some of my good
perfume.\\
203 - Yeah, then what?\\
204 - Well, then when they see us all
dressed up\\
205 - and they think we're going out,\\
206 - they'll get insanely jealous\\
207 - and they'll demand that we go out
with them.\\
208 - Fred get insanely jealous?\\
209 - Listen, if they're as bored as we
are,\\
210 - we'll even look good to them.\\
211 - Now, come on, let's get dressed.\\
212 - Well, there's no new movies.\\
213 - We've seen them all.\\
214 - You know something, Fred?\\
215 - I hate to admit this,\\
216 - but I'd like to see Lucy tonight.\\
217 - I can top that.\\
218 - I'd like to see Ethel.\\
219 - You know, if there was only some way\\
220 - that we could ask them\\
221 - without they thinking\\
222 - that we really miss them.\\
223 - (buzzing)\\
224 - What could that be?\\
225 - Good evening.\\
226 - Oh, hello.\\
227 - I'm sorry to barge in like this,\\
228 - but I wondered if I could get some of
my good perfume.\\
229 - Why, sure. Come in.
Won't you?\\
230 - Come right in.\\
231 - Gee, don't you look pretty.\\
232 - (giggling)\\
233 - Thank you.\\
234 - You, too, Ethel.\\
235 - Thank you, Frederick.\\
236 - We were just talking about you.\\
237 - You were?\\
238 - You were?!\\
239 - Um, I hope you boys are going to have\\
240 - as gay an evening as we are.\\
241 - Oh, yes.\\
242 - We've been invited to 21 for dinner.\\
243 - Oh, Ethel, 21 again?\\
244 - That's what the boys said-- 21.\\
245 - LUCY: Oh, dear.\\
246 - Well, we mustn't be late.\\
247 - I better get the perfume.\\
248 - Pardon me, please.\\
249 - You, uh...\\
250 - you two really been living it up,
huh?\\
251 - Oh, yes.\\
252 - We've been to 21 four times this
week.\\
253 - That's 84.\\
254 - Well, come on, Ethel.\\
255 - So long, boys.\\
256 - So long.\\
257 - Uh...\\
258 - Uh...\\
259 - Uh...\\
260 - Sorry we have to rush off like this.\\
261 - Ethel, promise me something, will
you?\\
262 - Um, let's be sensible tonight.\\
263 - Let's get in before 4:00 a.m.\\
264 - Okay, I promise.\\
265 - Okay.\\
266 - Well, so long, boys.\\
267 - So long, girls.\\
268 - We could stay and chat\\
269 - for just a little while.\\
270 - No. We'll be late.\\
271 - You understand how it is.\\
272 - Yeah, we know how it is.\\
273 - We have dates ourselves.\\
274 - Don't we, Fred?\\
275 - Yeah.\\
276 - Yeah.\\
277 - Oh.\\
278 - Well, so long.\\
279 - Well, how do you like it here at 21?\\
280 - TrÃ¨s gay.\\
281 - Where do you suppose the boys went?\\
282 - I told you 50 times.\\
283 - It's as plain as the nose on your
face.\\
284 - They didn't have any place to go.\\
285 - They just said that\\
286 - because they thought we were going
out.\\
287 - Now, let's hear no more about it,
shall we?\\
288 - Okay.\\
289 - Okay.\\
290 - You think I'm right, don't you?\\
291 - I don't know.\\
292 - I wish I could be sure.\\
293 - I'd sleep a lot better\\
294 - if I knew they were safely up there\\
295 - worrying about us.\\
296 - Come on.\\
297 - Where?\\
298 - We're going sneak up the back way\\
299 - and peek in our apartment.\\
300 - Once we know the boys are there,\\
301 - I think we'll sleep a lot better.\\
302 - Hey, Rick, why don't you come on to
bed.\\
303 - You go to sleep, Fred.\\
304 - Don't worry about me.\\
305 - I'm not.\\
306 - The slap of the cards\\
307 - keeps me awake.\\
308 - Fred, you're just as worried as I am,\\
309 - aren't you?\\
310 - You know something, Rick?\\
311 - I bet they didn't go out with anybody
at all.\\
312 - They're just faking.\\
313 - Yeah, well, I tried\\
314 - to talk myself into that one too.\\
315 - No, I mean it.\\
316 - If they had had a date,\\
317 - they wouldn't have come up here\\
318 - and made such a big to-do about it.\\
319 - Yeah. Ethel did kind of sort of want\\
320 - to stick around and chat, didn't she?\\
321 - You know something,\\
322 - I bet if we went down there right now\\
323 - and rang the bell, they'd answer it.\\
324 - Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.\\
325 - If we go down there and ring the bell\\
326 - they'd know that we didn't have any
dates.\\
327 - Let's go ring the bell\\
328 - and then hide around the corner.\\
329 - Yeah, and if they answer,\\
330 - we know it's them.\\
331 - Right.\\
332 - RICKY: Let's go. Come on.\\
333 - Oh, Ethel, I was wrong.\\
334 - They're not in there.\\
335 - I guess they did have dates.\\
336 - Oh, where do you suppose they are?\\
337 - I don't know.\\
338 - Go on.
Let's go back downstairs.\\
339 - Let's not go down the back way.\\
340 - It's too cold.\\
341 - Fine thing.\\
342 - They're out someplace having the time
of their lives.\\
343 - FRED: How did I know they really had
dates?\\
344 - That's them.
It's the boys.\\
345 - They're coming upstairs.\\
346 - Come on, down the back way.\\
347 - Oh. It's locked.\\
348 - Where do we go?\\
349 - The roof.\\
350 - The roof?\\
351 - I just want to know who they went out
with.\\
352 - Yeah, so do I.\\
353 - Well, I'm going to find out too.\\
354 - How?\\
355 - Well, I'm going to stay right here\\
356 - and when I hear someone come in,\\
357 - I'll look down and see who Lucy's
with.\\
358 - I'm a little bit curious too.\\
359 - Let's sit down here.
Come on.\\
360 - We'll wait right here.\\
361 - Lucy, take another look.\\
362 - Darn it, the watchdogs are still
there.\\
363 - Oh, why don't they go on inside?\\
364 - I'm getting cold.\\
365 - Gee, me too.\\
366 - It's pretty windy up here, isn't it?\\
367 - Oh, this is ridiculous.\\
368 - I'm going downstairs.\\
369 - Ethel, where's your pride?\\
370 - I don't know, but wherever it is,
it's frozen.\\
371 - Now, listen.
Just stay in here.\\
372 - It isn't so windy in here.\\
373 - Now, let's just wait a few more
minutes.\\
374 - Okay. That's long enough.\\
375 - Lucy, it's stuck.\\
376 - Let me try it.\\
377 - Ethel, this isn't stuck.\\
378 - It's locked from the inside.\\
379 - Oh, fine. What do we do now?\\
380 - Pound on it.
Pound on the door.\\
381 - Ricky?\\
382 - Fred?\\
383 - Ricky?\\
384 - Fred?
Open the door!\\
385 - Oh, why don't they come up and open
the door?\\
386 - You'll be glad to know\\
387 - they finally gave up and went inside.\\
388 - Fine. What do we do now?\\
389 - I don't know.\\
390 - I'm getting cold.\\
391 - So am I.\\
392 - And I'm tired too.\\
393 - (wailing)\\
394 - Ethel?\\
395 - Ethel, this isn't getting us
anyplace.\\
396 - We got to... we got to...
we got to be brave.\\
397 - Yeah. We've got to get hold of
ourselves.\\
398 - Yeah. We got to keep a stiff upper
lip.\\
399 - (wailing)\\
400 - We got to find some way\\
401 - to attract someone's attention down
on the street.\\
402 - How?\\
403 - I don't know.\\
404 - I know.\\
405 - What?\\
406 - One of us could jump off\\
407 - and... and then a crowd would collect\\
408 - and then she could tell the people\\
409 - that I was up here.\\
410 - I hope you don't think I'm a bum
sport,\\
411 - but let's think up another way.\\
412 - Oh, look. There's a light\\
413 - in that apartment across the alley.\\
414 - Oh, that's Mrs. Sanders.\\
415 - I know her.\\
416 - Mrs. Sanders!\\
417 - Yoo-hoo!\\
418 - Yoo-hoo!
Mrs. Sanders!\\
419 - Mrs. Sanders!\\
420 - She can't hear us.\\
421 - The windows are closed.\\
422 - We got to attract her attention.\\
423 - How?\\
424 - Here.\\
425 - (thumping)\\
426 - That wasn't far enough.\\
427 - (glass breaking)\\
428 - That was far enough.\\
429 - Too bad it wasn't Mrs. Sanders'
window.\\
430 - Oh, darn it.\\
431 - She turned off the light and went in
the other room.\\
432 - Oh, boy. That was a big waste of
time.\\
433 - No, it wasn't.\\
434 - The exercise kind of warmed me up.\\
435 - Well, what do we do now?\\
436 - Ethel!\\
437 - What?\\
438 - Our troubles are over.\\
439 - Come here.
Give me a hand.\\
440 - Give you a hand?\\
441 - Help me move this.\\
442 - Move it where?\\
443 - Look out, now.\\
444 - Let it fall right there.\\
445 - Then what?\\
446 - Right there.\\
447 - Push.\\
448 - Push?\\
449 - Push.\\
450 - Push hard.\\
451 - There.\\
452 - There.\\
453 - Put that box over here.\\
454 - Put the other one on top of it.\\
455 - There!\\
456 - There what?\\
457 - Yeah?\\
458 - We walk across there, and, and...\\
459 - and go down the stairs in the other
building.\\
460 - You mean walk across the board\\
461 - five flights up?\\
462 - Certainly.\\
463 - Oh, no. Oh, no.\\
464 - You do it.\\
465 - Listen, Ethel.\\
466 - I've already done all the hard work.\\
467 - I thought it up.\\
468 - Now, all you have to do\\
469 - is just tippy-toe across the board.\\
470 - Oh, no.\\
471 - Listen, why don't you think of this
board\\
472 - as a foot off the ground\\
473 - instead of five flights up? Huh?\\
474 - Then it will be a cinch.\\
475 - If it's such a cinch, you do it.\\
476 - All right.\\
477 - Good girl!\\
478 - Uh, come on.\\
479 - Who me? Oh, no, Lucy.\\
480 - I'm afraid to do it.\\
481 - There's nothing to it.\\
482 - Really. Come on.\\
483 - Will you help me?\\
484 - It's easy. Yeah.\\
485 - Come on. It's safe.\\
486 - Come on.\\
487 - Come on.\\
488 - (screaming)\\
489 - Don't!\\
490 - Don't look down!
Don't look down!\\
491 - Don't look down.\\
492 - Am I getting there, Lucy?\\
493 - Yeah.\\
494 - Am I almost there?\\
495 - Yeah.\\
496 - (screaming)\\
497 - (screaming)\\
498 - (crashing)\\
499 - (yawning)\\
500 - Wonder what time it is.\\
501 - I wonder what year it is.\\
502 - Oh! Ethel, it's raining.\\
503 - Oh, fine.\\
504 - Of all the things, it has to rain
too.\\
505 - Oh, Lucy...\\
506 - Look.\\
507 - It isn't raining out there.\\
508 - You see the pave..?\\
509 - Ricky!\\
510 - (laughing)\\
511 - How did you get up there?\\
512 - Same way you did.\\
513 - How did you know we were up here?\\
514 - Mrs. Sanders across the street
phoned.\\
515 - Well, what happened to your dates?\\
516 - What happened to your dates?\\
517 - Never mind that.\\
518 - This whole thing\\
519 - was your idea.\\
520 - Well, it was a lousy idea.\\
521 - I don't like having a vacation from
marriage.\\
522 - I want to be in a rut with you.\\
523 - And I want to be in a rut with you.\\

133 - ETHEL: Thank you for a wonderful
evening.\\
134 - Hide it.\\
135 - Hide it?\\
136 - Open your coat.\\
137 - Oh, wasn't that sweet of Miss Lewis\\
138 - to give us this little cake?\\
139 - Happy anniversary!
Happy anniversary!\\
140 - A television set!\\
141 - For us?\\
142 - LUCY: Yes.\\
143 - It was worth it.\\
144 - Let's get it inside and see how it
works.\\
145 - Well, there you are.\\
146 - Now, here's to make it dark or light.\\
147 - I know.\\
148 - Over here's the channel selector.\\
149 - Where it's marked "channel selector."\\
150 - That's right.\\
151 - Let's see what we get.\\
152 - How's that?\\
153 - There's a wavy line right across the
middle.\\
154 - Wait a minute, I got it.\\
155 - Honey, that's just making it worse.\\
156 - Yeah, now it's wavy all over.\\
157 - Let me try it, will you, Rick?\\
158 - Fred, will you, please?\\
159 - You don't know anything about this
set.\\
160 - I can make it just as wavy as you
can.\\
161 - Fred, it will have to be adjusted.\\
162 - Adjusted?
Yes.\\
163 - What are you going to do with it?\\
164 - I'll fix it.\\
165 - I brought this, just in case.\\
166 - I'll fix this thing right away, boy.\\
167 - I got to take\\
168 - the plug first.\\
169 - Hey, wait, Rick, look at this.\\
170 - "Danger, high voltage.\\
171 - Do not remove this back under any
circumstances."\\
172 - Oh, that's just for people\\
173 - that don't know anything about these
sets.\\
174 - Ah, here's the trouble right here,
you see?\\
175 - These two wires probably came loose\\
176 - when we were bringing the set
downstairs.\\
177 - Now, you see this red one here\\
178 - and the blue one?\\
179 - They're disconnected.\\
180 - I'll put them together, see?\\
181 - And... put them together just like
that.\\
182 - That ought to do it.\\
183 - Yeah?\\
184 - Now we'll plug it in,\\
185 - and we get ourselves a real picture.\\
186 - Gee, I hope so.\\
187 - You wait and see.\\
188 - ETHEL: Ricky!\\
189 - Now look what you've done!\\
190 - You've busted it!\\
191 - What I've done?\\
192 - It's the lousy wiring in this
broken-down apartment.\\
193 - Now just a minute, Ricky.\\
194 - Everything would have been okay\\
195 - if you hadn't butted in and tried to
fix it.\\
196 - FRED: Yes!\\
197 - Oh, Ethel, is that any way to talk to
Ricky?\\
198 - He was only trying to help.\\
199 - He helped it, all right.\\
200 - He ruined our TV set.\\
201 - What do you mean, your TV set?\\
202 - We just gave it to you.\\
203 - RICKY: Yeah!\\
204 - Well, a couple of Indian TV givers.\\
205 - Oh, yeah?\\
206 - Yeah! Why didn't you just give us the
set\\
207 - and keep your grubby, Cuban paws off
of it?\\
208 - He can put his grubby, Cuban paws\\
209 - any place he wants to.\\
210 - Stay out of this.\\
211 - Listen, you ungrateful old goat.\\
212 - That's the word, ungrateful.\\
213 - Yeah. This set is just like ours,\\
214 - and I fixed ours 100 times.\\
215 - It is not like yours.\\
216 - Yours works!\\
217 - Now it's like ours.\\
218 - Now, listen, you.\\
219 - You're going to pay for having that
set fixed, Mr. Mertz.\\
220 - Oh, yeah?\\
221 - You're going to pay to have our set
fixed,\\
222 - Mr. Ricardo.\\
223 - We are not.\\
224 - You are too.\\
225 - We are not.\\
226 - You are too,\\
227 - or we'll sue you.\\
228 - Well, we'll see who's going to sue
who.\\
229 - Yeah, we'll sue who's going to see...\\
230 - Come on, Fred,\\
231 - let's go.\\
232 - Good riddance.\\
233 - Yeah.\\
234 - Honey, look at our beautiful set.\\
235 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
236 - Look.\\
237 - Thanks for the present!\\
238 - You're welcome!\\
239 - Hi, honey.\\
240 - Oh, hi, dear.\\
241 - How did everything go today?\\
242 - Oh, everything's fine.\\
243 - That's good.\\
244 - I spent the whole afternoon\\
245 - figuring our case against the
Mertzes.\\
246 - No kidding?
Are we going to sue them?\\
247 - You're darn right we're going to sue
them,\\
248 - unless he pays for that set.\\
249 - What if he sues us first?\\
250 - They wouldn't dare.\\
251 - Now, I got the whole thing figured
out, right here.
(knocking)\\
252 - I'll get it.\\
253 - All right.\\
254 - Pardon me, is this the Lewis
apartment?\\
255 - Oh, no. Mrs. Lewis lives downstairs
in 1A.\\
256 - Oh, uh-- Say, haven't I seen you
before?\\
257 - You're...\\
258 - you're Ricky Ricardo, aren't you?\\
259 - Yes.\\
260 - Oh, gosh, could I have your
autograph?\\
261 - Sure.\\
262 - Would you sign it right there?\\
263 - There you are, my good man.\\
264 - Here's your autograph.\\
265 - On second thought, maybe you better
keep it.\\
266 - A summons!\\
267 - A summons?\\
268 - "The City of New York, Mertz v.
Ricardo."\\
269 - How do you like that?\\
270 - They are suing us.\\
271 - Okay, he asked for it.\\
272 - We better get ourselves a lawyer.\\
273 - Look, I told you, I got the whole
thing figured out.\\
274 - Who needs a lawyer?\\
275 - We do.\\
276 - Now, look, honey, I don't want any
lawyers lousing us up.\\
277 - I'm going to do it myself.\\
278 - Here.\\
279 - What's this?\\
280 - This is your onrehearsed,
espontaneous testimony.\\
281 - My "onrehearsed, espontaneous"
testimony.\\
282 - Right.\\
283 - And we don't need a lawyer?\\
284 - Nope.\\
285 - How about an interpreter?\\
286 - Now, let's not try to be funny.\\
287 - I'm trying to think.\\
288 - Wait a minute.\\
289 - Oh, I know, here.\\
290 - You sit here on this chair.\\
291 - This is the witness chair.\\
292 - This is the courtroom here.\\
293 - Now, let's practice.\\
294 - Okay.\\
295 - Now, Mrs. Ricardo, tell us in your
own words\\
296 - what happened on the night in
question.\\
297 - Well, we went down to the Mertzes...\\
298 - No, no, I mean in your own words that
I wrote for you.\\
299 - Oh.\\
300 - Uh, "Your Honor,\\
301 - "my grisly little story starts when
my dear, sweet husband\\
302 - looks adoringly at Ricky, and I went
to..."\\
303 - "Looks adoringly at Ricky"?\\
304 - They are directions, like stage
directions.\\
305 - I put a lot of them in there.\\
306 - Oh.\\
307 - They help point things up.\\
308 - Oh, yeah, yeah.\\
309 - "When my dear, sweet husband..."\\
310 - All right, that's long enough.\\
311 - Go ahead.\\
312 - "...and I went to help celebrate the
25th wedding anniversary\\
313 - "of our landlords, and then good
friends\\
314 - "Mr. And Mrs. Fred Mertz...\\
315 - Snarls at Mertzes."\\
316 - Oh, where will they be?\\
317 - They'll be\\
318 - right around there.\\
319 - Okay, okay, okay.\\
320 - Okay, that's enough already.\\
321 - "Little did we dream then that we'd
end up in court...\\
322 - "before such a handsome\\
323 - "distinguished, and honorable jurist
as you, Your Honor...\\
324 - Lift skirts a little higher."\\
325 - Oh! Really?\\
326 - Go ahead.\\
327 - I solemnly swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,\\
328 - and nothing but the truth, so help
me.\\
329 - You may be seated.\\
330 - Proceed.\\
331 - Now, uh...\\
332 - what is your name?\\
333 - You know my name.\\
334 - Please tell the court your name.\\
335 - Oh.\\
336 - Lucy Ricardo.\\
337 - Lucy Ricardo.\\
338 - Now, Mrs. Ricardo, in your own words,\\
339 - please tell the court what happened\\
340 - in the night in question.\\
341 - Well, Your Honor, my grisly little
story\\
342 - starts about three weeks ago\\
343 - when my dear, sweet husband...\\
344 - ...and I\\
345 - went to help celebrate the 25th
wedding anniversary\\
346 - of our landlords and then good
friends\\
347 - Mr. and Mrs. Fred Mertz.\\
348 - Okay, Mrs. Ricardo, please go on.\\
349 - "Without knowing and in good
faith..."\\
350 - I object, Your Honor.\\
351 - The witness has been rehearsed.\\
352 - Objection sustained.\\
353 - Proceed, young lady, but remember,\\
354 - you're on a witness stand.\\
355 - Yes, sir.\\
356 - Uh...\\
357 - In good faith, but not knowing\\
358 - they were preparing to stab us in the
back,\\
359 - we brought them, as a token of our
esteem\\
360 - an expensive, 20-inch television set.\\
361 - 20 inch!\\
362 - Little did we dream then\\
363 - that we would end up in court\\
364 - in front of such a... handsome,
distinguished\\
365 - and honorable jurist\\
366 - as you, Your Honor.\\
367 - I object, Your Honor.\\
368 - Objection overruled.\\
369 - Go on, my dear.\\
370 - Uh...\\
371 - Start back with that\\
372 - "handsome, distinguished, and
honorable jurist."\\
373 - Oh, yes.\\
374 - Little did we dream then that we'd
end up in court\\
375 - before such a handsome, distinguished\\
376 - and honorable jurist as you, Your
Honor.\\
377 - Well, Mr. Fred Mertz insisted on
adjusting the set,\\
378 - and in spite of my husband's repeated
warnings--\\
379 - and my husband is an electronics
specialist--\\
380 - uh, Mr. Mertz reached in\\
381 - and ripped off the back of the set\\
382 - and suddenly, there was a big
explosion-- poof!\\
383 - Poof.\\
384 - And then Mr. Mertz suddenly went out
of his head and ran amok.\\
385 - And he raced upstairs to our
apartment\\
386 - and with a fiendish gleam in his eye\\
387 - and flecks of foam on his lips, he
went straight\\
388 - to our television set and kicked the
glass in.\\
389 - And that's what really happened.\\
390 - Poor Mrs. Ricardo.\\
391 - Yeah.\\
392 - I rest my case, Your Honor.\\
393 - JUDGE: Attorney for the defense,\\
394 - would you care to cross-examine?\\
395 - No, thanks, Your Honor.\\
396 - I just want to call a witness\\
397 - who'll tell us what really happened.\\
398 - That will be for the court to decide.\\
399 - That's all, Lucy.\\
400 - That's all.\\
401 - Oh.\\
402 - Call your witness.\\
403 - Mrs. Fred Mertz.\\
404 - Mrs. Fred Mertz.\\
405 - I heard him.\\
406 - Raise your right hand and repeat
after me:\\
407 - I solemnly swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,\\
408 - and nothing but the truth, so help
me.\\
409 - I solemnly swear to tell the truth,\\
410 - the whole truth and nothing but the
truth,\\
411 - which is more than someone in this
room did, so help me.\\
412 - You may sit down.\\
413 - What are you trying to do--\\
414 - lose the case for us?\\
415 - Your name, please.\\
416 - Ethel Mertz.\\
417 - Tell the court, please, just exactly
what happened\\
418 - on the night in question.\\
419 - Well...\\
420 - on the night of our wedding
anniversary\\
421 - the Ricardos came down to our
apartment\\
422 - and forced their company on us
without being invited.\\
423 - As an excuse for an anniversary
present,\\
424 - they brought us an old, broken-down,\\
425 - secondhand television set.\\
426 - Yes, go on.\\
427 - Well, the set was playing pretty
good,\\
428 - which is a miracle in itself, when
suddenly, Mr. Ricardo,\\
429 - or, as he is more commonly known,\\
430 - SeÃ±or Know-It-All,\\
431 - took an axe from his pocket and
started hacking it.\\
432 - It wasn't long before the set
exploded,\\
433 - and then, this Cuban maniac\\
434 - forced us all to go to his apartment\\
435 - and led us to his television set\\
436 - and with a look of fiendish glee,\\
437 - picked up my husband's foot and
pushed it\\
438 - through the glass.\\
439 - FRED: That's exactly what happened,
Your Honor.\\
440 - Your Honor, I object.\\
441 - Order, order, order!\\
442 - Order!\\
443 - Really!\\
444 - Well.\\
445 - There would seem to be\\
446 - some slight discrepancy in your
stories.\\
447 - I think the only way we can get at
the truth of this\\
448 - is to reenact the scene.\\
449 - Bailiff, will you go into my chambers\\
450 - and bring out my television set?\\
451 - Yes, Your Honor.\\
452 - Now, then, before we reenact this,\\
453 - I want to warn you all that this is a
court of law.\\
454 - You are under oath.\\
455 - And the penalty for perjury is $500
or 90 days in jail.\\
456 - Ew...\\
457 - That's right.\\
458 - Bring it right through.\\
459 - Now, Mrs. Ricardo, will you show me\\
460 - exactly how Mr. Mertz pushed your
husband out of the way\\
461 - and ripped the back of the set off?\\
462 - Well...\\
463 - Your Honor...\\
464 - now that I think of it, maybe it was
Ricky\\
465 - that took off the back of the set.\\
466 - Really?\\
467 - Well, now that she thinks of it,
yeah.\\
468 - FRED: Yeah!\\
469 - Now, Mrs. Mertz,\\
470 - I want you to go over there\\
471 - and show me exactly what happened.\\
472 - Just where did Mr. Ricardo hit the
set with the axe?\\
473 - Um...\\
474 - now that I...\\
475 - I don't think it was exactly an axe.\\
476 - It was more like a sort of a
screwdriver.\\
477 - And then what happened?\\
478 - I'll tell you what happened.\\
479 - There was a couple of loose wires\\
480 - in the back of this television set--\\
481 - a red one and a blue one--\\
482 - and this dope tried to put them
together.\\
483 - Well, they're supposed to be
together.\\
484 - FRED: They are not supposed to be
together.\\
485 - Look at this set here...\\
486 - Hey, Your Honor, they're loose here
too.\\
487 - They are?\\
488 - The red and the blue.\\
489 - Let me see.\\
490 - Pardon me.\\
491 - Oh, well, just putting these two
wires together\\
492 - couldn't cause an explosion.\\
493 - Maybe it couldn't, but it did.\\
494 - Now, now, just a minute.\\
495 - I happen to know something about
television sets myself,\\
496 - and I know positively\\
497 - that this could never cause an
explosion.\\
498 - You must have done something else.\\
499 - Did you?\\
500 - Well, sir, with him yelling at me all
the time...\\
501 - Yeah, he never shut his mouth.\\
502 - (all talking at once)\\
503 - Quiet! Quiet!\\
504 - Now, look, all four of you.\\
505 - Now, this was obviously\\
506 - just one of those misunderstandings
among friends.\\
507 - Now, I want you all to go into my
chambers\\
508 - and talk this over and apologize to
each other.\\
509 - After all, good friends are worth\\
510 - more than the price of a television
set.\\
511 - Now, go on.\\
512 - Take them in, Bailiff.\\
513 - And when you come out\\
514 - I want you all to be pals again.\\
515 - This way, please.\\
516 - (laughing)\\
517 - You were right, Judge.\\
518 - Good friends are worth more\\
519 - than the price of a television set.\\
520 - Yeah, Judge, we apologized all
around,\\
521 - and everything's just dandy now.\\
522 - Yes, sir. We are going to pay for
their set,\\
523 - and they're going to pay for our set.\\
524 - Ah, that's wonderful, wonderful.\\
525 - Thank you very much.\\
526 - You've sure been nice.\\
527 - Not at all.\\
528 - Thank you very much.\\
529 - Thank you, Judge.\\
530 - Now, let this be a lesson\\
531 - to all of us.\\
532 - We must never lose our tempers.\\
533 - Good-bye.\\
534 - We remember.\\
535 - Thank you, Judge.\\
536 - Good-bye.\\
537 - Good-bye, Judge.\\

1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Hi, Rick.\\
3 - Oh, hiya, Fred.\\
4 - Is Ethel up here?\\
5 - No. She went out with Lucy.\\
6 - They went to the home show.\\
7 - Oh... no.\\
8 - Why do they have to go and look at
those model homes,\\
9 - stuffed with all that fancy
furniture?\\
10 - It'll only make them unhappy.\\
11 - I know.\\
12 - Last year Lucy went to the home show.\\
13 - When she got home,\\
14 - she said all of our old furniture
gave her the hives.\\
15 - It was two weeks\\
16 - before Ethel could walk into our
living room\\
17 - without bursting into tears.\\
18 - When I told Lucy that she couldn't
redecorate,\\
19 - she cried all night.\\
20 - Well, let's face it,\\
21 - we're in for another session with the
Sobbsy twins.\\
22 - I don't know, Fred.\\
23 - I got a surprise that might, uh, take
their minds off of it.\\
24 - Yeah?\\
25 - I managed to get four seats\\
26 - for the new Rodgers and Hammerstein
show\\
27 - tomorrow night.\\
28 - Oh, boy!
Four of them!\\
29 - Hi, honey.\\
30 - (Lucy sighs)\\
31 - Hi, Ethel.\\
32 - Ugh!\\
33 - It's even worse than I remembered.\\
34 - Hey, hey, honey, I got a wonderful
surprise for you.\\
35 - Sit down, will you?\\
36 - Sit down?\\
37 - On that?\\
38 - How could anyone possibly sit on
that?\\
39 - Well, honey, it's easy.\\
40 - You stand up here like this, and you
bend your knees,\\
41 - and there you are, huh?\\
42 - Comfortable?\\
43 - No, no. It's so dirty,\\
44 - and the-and the springs are lumpy,\\
45 - and it's... oh...
it's repulsive.\\
46 - And that desk and that tired, old
lamp,\\
47 - and that chair... oh!\\
48 - (shivers)\\
49 - You think this is bad?\\
50 - I have to go down and look at our
apartment.\\
51 - Never mind. Never mind.\\
52 - It all stays as is.\\
53 - But our furniture looks crummy.\\
54 - It looks crummy because it is crummy.\\
55 - But it's all paid for, so forget it.\\
56 - Yeah, and that goes for our stuff,
too.\\
57 - Ricky, you don't really expect\\
58 - me to live...
(all talking)\\
59 - I cannot spend one more penny...\\
60 - (all talking at once)\\
61 - Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.\\
62 - Wait a minute!\\
63 - Ethel, what are we going through this
for?\\
64 - We're going to get our furniture.\\
65 - Oh, yes, I forgot.\\
66 - What is this?\\
67 - FRED: Look out for a trick.\\
68 - It's no trick.\\
69 - The home show is having a big drawing\\
70 - and the winners are each getting\\
71 - five rooms of beautiful furniture\\
72 - absolutely free.\\
73 - Yes.\\
74 - (Fred whistles)\\
75 - Oh. And you two put your names down?\\
76 - That's right.		 Yes.\\
77 - Oh, well, Fred, help me get this junk
out of the way\\
78 - before the new furniture arrives.\\
79 - Excuse me.\\
80 - Go ahead, make fun.\\
81 - You're going to feel pretty silly
when we win.\\
82 - Now, look, honey,\\
83 - sit down, will you?\\
84 - Hmm!\\
85 - Force yourself.\\
86 - Now, look, listen to me, will you?\\
87 - Do you know how many people\\
88 - put their names down on a thing like
that?\\
89 - Yes, I do.\\
90 - Do you know that your chances are one
in a million?\\
91 - (Ethel and Lucy chuckle)\\
92 - A lot you know.\\
93 - We each made out a hundred cards.\\
94 - Our chances are one in 10,000.\\
95 - Now, look, let's forget the whole
thing, huh?\\
96 - We will until they call us and tell
us that we won.\\
97 - All right, all right.\\
98 - Now, in the meantime,\\
99 - I got some real good news for you.
What?\\
100 - Well, I managed to get four seats\\
101 - for the opening of a new musical
tomorrow night.\\
102 - Not the Rodgers and Hammerstein show?\\
103 - Right.\\
104 - Oh, honey, how wonderful.\\
105 - ETHEL: Ricky, that's wonderful!\\
106 - Uh-oh.\\
107 - ETHEL: What's the matter, Lucy?\\
108 - We can't go out tomorrow night.\\
109 - Why not?
What do you mean you can't go out?\\
110 - They might call us from the home
show.\\
111 - So what?
They'll call you back.\\
112 - Oh, no, they won't.\\
113 - You have to be home when they call.\\
114 - Now, look, honey, you know how tough
it is\\
115 - to get seats for an opening night,\\
116 - and this is Rodgers and Hammerstein.\\
117 - I'm sorry, dear. It's out of the
question.\\
118 - I'm not leaving this house\\
119 - until the home show drawing is over,
and that's final.\\
120 - Hey, Fred. Gee, I'm glad you stopped
by.\\
121 - I wanted to see you.\\
122 - Hey, Rick.
What are you doing around here\\
123 - this early in the morning?\\
124 - Well, I had a bunch of business calls
to make\\
125 - and Lucy won't let me use the phone.\\
126 - Yeah, I know what you mean.\\
127 - We may as well forget about that
opening night.\\
128 - Well, I don't know, Fred.\\
129 - I got a plan on how to get Lucy and
Ethel\\
130 - out of the house tonight.\\
131 - How?\\
132 - Make them think that one of them won
the prize.\\
133 - What?\\
134 - Well, look, we know that they haven't
got a chance anyway.\\
135 - So all we have to do\\
136 - is one of us has to get to the phone,\\
137 - call Lucy and tell her that she won
the prize.\\
138 - And then make sure that you hang up\\
139 - before she recognizes your voice.\\
140 - Wait a minute.\\
141 - Why should I be the one to call?\\
142 - Well, Fred, I'd be glad to do it,\\
143 - I'd love to do it,\\
144 - but she'd recognize my accent in a
minute.\\
145 - You're going to use an accent?\\
146 - Never mind.\\
147 - Now, will you call her?\\
148 - Well, okay, okay.\\
149 - Well, go ahead; there's the phone.\\
150 - Well, now, wait a minute, wait a
minute.\\
151 - I got to get up my nerve.\\
152 - Oh, Hazel, give me a double-chocolate
malted.\\
153 - I'll see you later.\\
154 - Hi.\\
155 - Ethel, what are you doing away from
your phone?\\
156 - I'm not.\\
157 - Is it connected?\\
158 - Yeah. Fred fixed it\\
159 - so I could go anyplace in the
building.\\
160 - Where did you ever get such a long
cord?\\
161 - Well, don't tell the phone company,\\
162 - but every time anybody moves out of
an apartment,\\
163 - Fred swipes the extension cord.\\
164 - Oh. Gee, my phone hasn't rung all
morning.\\
165 - I wonder if there's anything wrong
with it.\\
166 - Oh, darn these party lines.\\
167 - There's always somebody using it.\\
168 - Well, tell them to get off.\\
169 - Oh, you know how much good that would
do me.\\
170 - I've had run-ins with these
characters before.\\
171 - Well, it's about time she named the
date.\\
172 - Do you know how long she's been
engaged?\\
173 - Huh?\\
174 - 14 years.\\
175 - 16 years.\\
176 - I'll believe the marriage when I see
it.\\
177 - Pardon me, but would you please get
off the phone?\\
178 - Wait a minute, Agnes.\\
179 - Miss Big Ears is listening in.\\
180 - I'm sorry, but the phone is in use.\\
181 - But this is an emergency.\\
182 - It's a matter of life and death.\\
183 - Help, fire!\\
184 - Help, fire!
Fire!\\
185 - BOTH: Help!\\
186 - Ah, try something new.\\
187 - Now, what were we saying, Agnes?\\
188 - Oh... there's no use.\\
189 - I'll bet the home show's calling me
right now.\\
190 - Oh, dear.\\
191 - Hey, I got an idea.\\
192 - This worked once before.\\
193 - What?\\
194 - Now, be quiet.\\
195 - ...absolutely.\\
196 - What else is new, Agnes?\\
197 - AGNES: Oh, so many things.\\
198 - Boy, have I got dirt to spill.\\
199 - Go ahead. I'm listening.\\
200 - (imitating both women): Oops, there
goes my doorbell.
I'll have to call you back.\\
201 - Okay, dear, good-bye.
Okay, good-bye.\\
202 - (satisfied sigh)\\
203 - There now.\\
204 - Gee, if it doesn't ring soon for one
of us,\\
205 - I'm going to be a nervous wreck.\\
206 - So am I.\\
207 - All this suspense is making me
hungry.\\
208 - Well, come on.\\
209 - Let's go in the kitchen and make a
sandwich.\\
210 - We can hear the phone from there.\\
211 - Okay.\\
212 - (phone ringing)\\
213 - Hello? Hello?
Hello? Hello?\\
214 - It's the home show.\\
215 - You got my phone.
Hello?\\
216 - I have not.
This is my phone.\\
217 - No, that's my phone!\\
218 - Ethel, that's my phone.\\
219 - Hello?\\
220 - Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Ricardo.\\
221 - Yes.\\
222 - I did?\\
223 - I didn't?\\
224 - I did?\\
225 - Oh... oh, thank you so much.\\
226 - Oh, yes, yes, I'm very thrilled.\\
227 - Yes. Good-bye.\\
228 - Ethel, I won!\\
229 - I won all the furniture!\\
230 - Gee, that's swell.\\
231 - And that's for you, you ugly, old
thing.\\
232 - Oh, Lucy, look what you've done.\\
233 - You broke off the leg.\\
234 - I don't care.\\
235 - I won! I won!\\
236 - I won all that wonderful furniture.\\
237 - And you know what I'm going to do
now?
What?\\
238 - I'm going to get rid of all this
junk.\\
239 - I'm going to call a secondhand man\\
240 - and I'm going to have him come over\\
241 - and I'm going to sell him everything
but the lightbulbs.\\
242 - Now, that glue ought to hold it.\\
243 - Help me set it up.\\
244 - Okay.\\
245 - You ready?
Mm-hmm.\\
246 - Oh... boy, will I be glad to get rid
of this junk.\\
247 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
248 - Oh, there he is.\\
249 - Hide that glue.\\
250 - Mrs. Ricardo?\\
251 - Yes.\\
252 - I'm Dan Jenkins, secondhand furniture
man.\\
253 - Oh, come right in.\\
254 - Is this the junk you want to sell?\\
255 - Junk?\\
256 - Why, this is fine furniture in
excellent condition.\\
257 - Yeah...\\
258 - Yeah, sure.\\
259 - (plays piano chord)\\
260 - Hmm.\\
261 - Hmm...\\
262 - Ah, ah... oh.\\
263 - Uh...\\
264 - This is my neighbor, Mrs. Mertz.\\
265 - Mr. Jenkins.\\
266 - How do you do?
How do you do?
How do you do?\\
267 - Well...\\
268 - Y-You can see\\
269 - that everything's practically new.\\
270 - It's hardly been used at all.\\
271 - Yeah, I see.\\
272 - She's right.\\
273 - Many times I've been up here when
nobody sat down.\\
274 - Uh-huh.\\
275 - You see, I wouldn't dream of selling\\
276 - except that someone's giving us some
new furniture.\\
277 - Well, uh...
bedroom furniture, too?\\
278 - Yes, in there.\\
279 - Ah.\\
280 - I don't think he likes it, do you?\\
281 - He just wants us to think that.\\
282 - You watch-- when he comes out,\\
283 - he's going to make me a very low
offer\\
284 - and I'll just get him to go higher
and higher.\\
285 - You watch.\\
286 - Mrs. Ricardo...\\
287 - Yes?\\
288 - Well, I'll take your furniture.\\
289 - You will?\\
290 - Yeah, and I'll give you...\\
291 - Oh, I shouldn't go this high,\\
292 - but I took an immediate liking to
you,\\
293 - so I'll give you $100.\\
294 - $100?\\
295 - Well, you'd better look again, Mr.
Jenkins.\\
296 - All right, make it $90.\\
297 - Ninety?!\\
298 - Oh, that's ridiculous.\\
299 - Why, this coffee table alone is worth
more than that.\\
300 - Seventy-five.\\
301 - I'll take it.\\
302 - Sign the bill of sale, please.\\
303 - $5... $30, $60...\\
304 - $70 and $5.\\
305 - Thank you.\\
306 - I'll have my truck in the
neighborhood this afternoon.\\
307 - Can I pick up the furniture then?\\
308 - Oh, well, could you check back?\\
309 - I'd kind of like to have the new
furniture here before you take this.\\
310 - All right.\\
311 - Now, you ladies sure made a sharp
deal.\\
312 - Getting 75 bucks out of me for all
this broken-down stuff.\\
313 - Ooh.\\
314 - Well...\\
315 - I'll just have to make it up on the
next customer.\\
316 - Afternoon, ladies.\\
317 - LUCY: Good-bye.\\
318 - Gee, I'm sorry.\\
319 - Well, it really doesn't matter,\\
320 - as long as I'm getting the new
furniture for nothing.\\
321 - Oh.\\
322 - Gee, you know it's a shame to put all
that new stuff in here\\
323 - with this old paint and paper.\\
324 - You know what I'm going to do with
this money?
What?\\
325 - I'm going to repaint and repaper this
whole dingy apartment.\\
326 - Oh, Lucy, paper hangers are awful
expensive.\\
327 - Who needs a paper hanger?\\
328 - We'll do it ourselves.\\
329 - We will?\\
330 - Sure. Come on, let's go downtown\\
331 - and buy all the paper and stuff.\\
332 - Okay, I'll get dressed.\\
333 - Hurry up, now.\\
334 - (music)\\
335 - There.
Did you get it all?\\
336 - Is this everything we need?\\
337 - Yep. Let me see it.\\
338 - Let me see how it looks here.\\
339 - Oh, boy! Isn't that pretty?\\
340 - Isn't it beautiful for a bedroom?\\
341 - Uh-huh.\\
342 - It's so dreamy.\\
343 - Isn't that nice?\\
344 - Well, let's get started.\\
345 - By the time we get to the living
room,\\
346 - we'll be professionals.\\
347 - We got to measure it.\\
348 - Now, I got to find out\\
349 - how much paper there is in each roll.
Okay.\\
350 - Got to get-- have an idea\\
351 - of how many we need, you know?\\
352 - All right.\\
353 - Okay... there.\\
354 - That's-that's about it now, I think.
All right.\\
355 - Put it down here a minute.\\
356 - Let's see now.\\
357 - It's about... that high.\\
358 - Hold it up.\\
359 - All right.\\
360 - (giggles)\\
361 - There.\\
362 - Now we got to put the paste on it.\\
363 - All right.\\
364 - Turn it over.\\
365 - Lay it down on the floor.\\
366 - Oh, Lucy, it'll get dirty.\\
367 - Oh, yeah.\\
368 - Well, you hold it up in front of you\\
369 - and I'll put paste on it that way.\\
370 - All right.
Now be careful.\\
371 - Ready?
Yeah.\\
372 - Hold on now.\\
373 - All right.\\
374 - Okay.\\
375 - Keep it moving.
Okay. Okay.\\
376 - Keep it moving.
All right.\\
377 - Keep it moving.\\
378 - Oh, Lucy!\\
379 - Ethel, I'm sorry.
Oh...\\
380 - You're on the paper!\\
381 - I'm sorry, Lucy, but you hit me in
the face with that.\\
382 - Oh, look what you did.\\
383 - Well, let's straighten it out.\\
384 - Wait... wait...\\
385 - Ethel, we haven't got a lot of paper.\\
386 - You have to be careful.\\
387 - Could we use that-that little...?\\
388 - Oh, Lucy.\\
389 - This looks like the biggest chunk
here.\\
390 - Oh... here.\\
391 - Whoo!\\
392 - Oh, we can't use this.\\
393 - We'll have to cut another piece.\\
394 - All right, put it over here.\\
395 - Oh, that's a shame.\\
396 - I got that so pretty, too.\\
397 - Let's try another one, huh?\\
398 - All right now.\\
399 - Be careful now.
I will.\\
400 - There. Now, that's about it.\\
401 - There.\\
402 - Now...\\
403 - turn it over.\\
404 - Careful.\\
405 - Okay.\\
406 - Oh, no, that didn't work.\\
407 - Put it down on the floor.\\
408 - Oh, okay.\\
409 - (both grunt)\\
410 - There we are.\\
411 - Yep.\\
412 - It'll look so pretty up there.\\
413 - Oh.\\
414 - Oh, Lucy.\\
415 - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\\
416 - I'm sorry, honey.
Now leave me alone.\\
417 - Move back.\\
418 - There now.\\
419 - Okay.\\
420 - There now.\\
421 - Now we got to get it on the wall.\\
422 - Where?\\
423 - Right over there in the corner.\\
424 - Okay, in the corner.\\
425 - All right. Listen, you'd better come
up here\\
426 - on this side with me.\\
427 - All right.\\
428 - Now be careful.\\
429 - All right.\\
430 - Okay?
Ready.\\
431 - Okay, let's go.\\
432 - What's the matter with you?\\
433 - You said over here in the corner.\\
434 - Well, I meant in this corner!\\
435 - Oh...!\\
436 - Now take ahold of it.\\
437 - Okay.\\
438 - Now, are you ready?\\
439 - Now, before we start,\\
440 - which wall do you want it on?\\
441 - That wall.\\
442 - Put it in the middle--\\
443 - we'll have plenty of room on either
side.\\
444 - Okay.
Ready?\\
445 - One, two, three.\\
446 - Go!\\
447 - How do you get the slack out?\\
448 - Not very straight, is it?\\
449 - No.\\
450 - Well, look, we can put the rest of it
on at this angle\\
451 - and then it'll be uniform.\\
452 - You'll have to hang on the mattress\\
453 - to keep from falling out of bed.\\
454 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
455 - Mrs. Ricardo, got my van downstairs\\
456 - ready to pick up my furniture.\\
457 - Oh, well, uh, my new stuff hasn't
arrived yet.\\
458 - Oh. Well, I'll call back in the
morning, huh?\\
459 - Okay. I'll sure be glad to get rid of
this old junk.\\
460 - Bye.\\
461 - Bye.\\
462 - Hi, honey.\\
463 - Oh, darn.\\
464 - I'd hoped that you wouldn't get home
until later.\\
465 - What's going on?\\
466 - Well, I kind of wanted to surprise
you, but I won.\\
467 - The home show called, and I won all
the furniture.\\
468 - Oh, that's nice, yeah, but, uh, what
are you doing?\\
469 - Well, did you see that man that just
left?\\
470 - Yeah.\\
471 - Well, that's Mr. Jenkins\\
472 - and I sold him all of our furniture
for $75.\\
473 - And Ethel and I are...
You what?!\\
474 - What?
You what?!\\
475 - I said, I sold him all the furniture.\\
476 - Mr. Jenkins!
Mr. Jenkins!\\
477 - Mr. Jenkins!\\
478 - JENKINS: You calling me?\\
479 - Yeah. Please come back here, Mr.
Jenkins!\\
480 - Please come back!
Hurry up!\\
481 - Oh, my goodness.\\
482 - What's the matter, Ricky?\\
483 - He gave me $75 for all the stuff.\\
484 - $75 for all...?\\
485 - (whining): Oh, no.\\
486 - Me and my great ideas.\\
487 - That wasn't the home show calling,\\
488 - that was Fred.\\
489 - Fred?\\
490 - Yeah, Fred.\\
491 - Ricky, what are you saying?\\
492 - Well, I thought it was a nice way\\
493 - to get you out of the house to go to
the opening...\\
494 - Somebody call me?\\
495 - Yeah, Mr. Jenkins, come here, would
you please?\\
496 - I want to talk to you a minute.\\
497 - Here, sit down, won't you?\\
498 - This is a nice chair here.\\
499 - Sit down, Mr. Jenkins.\\
500 - Sit down here a minute.\\
501 - Listen, Mr. Jenkins...\\
502 - Listen... there's been a terrible
mistake.\\
503 - It's all my stupidity.\\
504 - You see, my wife didn't win the prize
at all,\\
505 - and, you see, I thought...\\
506 - Uh, I want to get the furniture back.\\
507 - Oh, fine, that's okay by me.\\
508 - Thank you.
Give me the $75, will you, honey?\\
509 - What's the matter, honey?\\
510 - I spent the money for the wallpaper.\\
511 - Oh. Well, I'll give you the $75.\\
512 - Hey, just a minute, Mr. Ricardo.\\
513 - I'll be glad to sell you this stuff,\\
514 - but certainly you don't expect to get
three rooms\\
515 - full of beautiful furniture like this
for a measly $75?\\
516 - But that's what you paid for it!\\
517 - That's true,\\
518 - but I'm in the business.\\
519 - It isn't just the purchase price.\\
520 - I got to add my overhead,
electricity, rent,\\
521 - insurance, storage charges,
advertising.\\
522 - You haven't moved a stick of
furniture out of this apartment.\\
523 - Yeah...
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.\\
524 - Lucy, did you sign anything?\\
525 - No...
only a bill of sale.\\
526 - Only a bill of sale.\\
527 - All right, Mr. Jenkins,\\
528 - you paid $75 for the furniture?\\
529 - Now, how much all this other stuff
that you mentioned?\\
530 - What... what does it add up to?\\
531 - What? What was...?\\
532 - Now remember, you haven't moved
anything\\
533 - out of the apartment.\\
534 - Oh, I'm allowing for that.\\
535 - Better take another look at the
furniture.\\
536 - We've had it an awful long time,\\
537 - and the paint's all off,\\
538 - and it's real ugly, and it's old,
and...\\
539 - I realize how much\\
540 - these valuable antiques mean to you,
madam.\\
541 - Antiques?\\
542 - Lucy, please, you said enough.\\
543 - Wha...\\
544 - All right, how much?
How much?
Well...\\
545 - I shouldn't really do this.\\
546 - I'm taking off every penny I can.\\
547 - I'll let you have it all for...\\
548 - only $500.\\
549 - $500!\\
550 - That's ridiculous.\\
551 - I won't buy it back.\\
552 - I'll get the fellas in the van...\\
553 - Now, wait a minute.
Don't hurry up so fast.\\
554 - Come back here a minute, will you?\\
555 - Now, let's compromise, maybe.\\
556 - How about two, uh...?\\
557 - $300 and, uh...\\
558 - uh, $95?\\
559 - Well, I'm a lousy businessman\\
560 - but, uh, I like the way you sing
"Babalu,"\\
561 - so I'll take it.\\
562 - Thank you.\\
563 - Mira, lo que me pasa a mi,\\
564 - no le pasa a nadie en este pais.\\
565 - Vende el furniture for $75.\\
566 - Y lo tengo que comprar ahora por
$395.\\
567 - Ese va ser.
Aqui esta.\\
568 - Ah, you two are certainly making a
sharp deal. Well...\\
569 - I guess I'll just have to make it
up...\\
570 - Yeah, you'll just make it up on your
next customer. I know.\\
571 - Well... evening.\\
572 - Good-bye.\\
573 - Adios.\\
574 - Now, Ricky,\\
575 - it wasn't my fault.\\
576 - I know. I know.\\
577 - It's all my fault.\\
578 - It is?\\
579 - Yeah. Come on, I'll help you\\
580 - carry the stuff into the bedroom.
Come on.\\
581 - In the bedroom?\\
582 - Yeah.\\
583 - Uh, well, we-we really haven't\\
584 - finished papering in there yet, and
I, uh...\\
585 - What? What? What?
What did you say?\\
586 - I said, we haven't finished papering
in there yet, and...\\
587 - -Who is "we"?
-"We" is Ethel and Lucy paper hanger.\\
588 - Oh, this...
this I got to see.\\
589 - No, Ricky.\\
590 - I won't get mad.\\
591 - You promise?\\
592 - I promise you I won't get mad.\\
593 - Promise?
Yeah. Just let me see it.\\
594 - Now, come on.\\
595 - You and Ethel papered the room.
Uh-huh.\\
596 - Just the two of you, huh?
Uh-huh.\\
597 - Ricky, what's the matter?\\
598 - It makes me dizzy.\\
599 - Open the window, will you?
I need some air.\\
600 - Window? Window.\\
601 - Lucy, what have you done with the
windows?\\
602 - Now, don't worry.\\
603 - It's here someplace.\\
604 - There.\\
605 - How can you possibly paper over a
window?!\\
606 - Now, Ricky, don't bawl me out.\\
607 - That's only a minor thing.\\
608 - Wait till I tell Ethel I didn't win.\\
609 - What's the matter?\\
610 - Where is Ethel?\\
611 - Where is Ethel?\\
612 - Ethel?\\
613 - Ethel?\\
614 - Ethel?\\
615 - Ethel?\\
616 - Ethel!\\
617 - What?\\
618 - Ethel, the most terrible thing has
happened.\\
619 - FRED: Oh, Ricky!\\
620 - I'm in here, Fred!
What? What?\\
621 - I was waiting for you to get home.\\
622 - What happened?\\
623 - Lucy sold all the furniture and
papered the room,\\
624 - thanks to a very funny phone call.\\
625 - What phone call?\\
626 - Look, don't try to cover it up.\\
627 - She knows all about it.\\
628 - No, no, no. That's what I was going
to tell you.\\
629 - I lost my nerve and I didn't make
that phone call.\\
630 - Then who did?\\
631 - It must have been the home show!\\
632 - I won! I really won!
I won!\\
633 - I really won!\\

1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - (piano playing)\\
3 - One day in Mexico the radio picked up
a station\\
4 - From the USA\\
5 - I know the people heard just what
occurred\\
6 - A corny program known as Giveaway\\
7 - They heard a lady win a diamond pin,
a sable\\
8 - And a brand-new limousine\\
9 - She took home all the loot and more
to boot\\
10 - For knowing 12 and five are 17\\
11 - That day in Mexico\\
12 - The radio was heard by one whose name
was Don Jose\\
13 - He said if that's what goes on all
those shows\\
14 - I think I go for visit right away\\
15 - He got his papers quick\\
16 - And then a ticket on a plane for
Hollywood and Vine\\
17 - He got to town at 8:00, and sure as
fate\\
18 - He wound up in a studio at 9:00\\
19 - He knew that Mexico would hear the
show\\
20 - And he was set to make his family
proud\\
21 - And so he whistled and he raised his
hand and yelled\\
22 - Until they picked him from the crowd\\
23 - He got the biggest score and what is
more\\
24 - He even won the jackpot of the show\\
25 - He blew his top because the prize--\\
26 - It was an airplane trip right back\\
27 - (glissando)\\
28 - To Mexico.\\
29 - That's all, Marco.
My throat is sore today.\\
30 - Will you call Lucy and tell her I'll
be home right away?\\
31 - Okay, Des.
Thank you.\\
32 - Bye.
Bye.\\
33 - Lucy?
Yeah?\\
34 - Your new furniture came.\\
35 - Really? What's it like?\\
36 - I don't know, I was so busy,\\
37 - I just told them to put it all in the
apartment.\\
38 - Oh, I'm just dying to see it.\\
39 - Oh, darn this key.\\
40 - You know, for the rent you charge,\\
41 - you could have bigger keyholes.\\
42 - You know, I think there's\\
43 - a little too much furniture in here.\\
44 - It does look a little overcrowded,
doesn't it?\\
45 - I forgot we had to take the old
furniture out.\\
46 - (phone ringing)\\
47 - Oh, well...\\
48 - Gee, there's a lot of wonderful
stuff, huh?\\
49 - (ringing)\\
50 - Where's the phone?\\
51 - Where's the phone?\\
52 - Yeah. It's not here.\\
53 - Oh.
(ringing)\\
54 - Well, now, where is the phone?\\
55 - (ringing)\\
56 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
57 - What did they do with it?\\
58 - (ringing continues)\\
59 - Let's see now,\\
60 - I was lying on the sofa talking.\\
61 - It's on the floor someplace.\\
62 - Yeah, sounds like it, doesn't it?\\
63 - Lucy!\\
64 - Did you find it?\\
65 - No.\\
66 - Oh.\\
67 - Oh, here it is, for heaven's sake.\\
68 - (ringing)\\
69 - Oh, gosh.\\
70 - Hello?\\
71 - Oh, too late.\\
72 - Now I'll never know who it was\\
73 - and that drives me absolutely crazy.\\
74 - Me, too.\\
75 - Gee. Hey, look at this stuff.\\
76 - Isn't it going to look wonderful?\\
77 - Uh-huh.\\
78 - Oh, look at that luscious chair.\\
79 - Oh, boy.\\
80 - Oh, Ethel, will you help me get the
old stuff out?\\
81 - I'm dying to see how the room's gonna
look.\\
82 - Where will I put it?\\
83 - Let's take it and put it in the hall,\\
84 - all the old stuff.\\
85 - Okay.\\
86 - Here.\\
87 - Listen, you know,\\
88 - I'm not going to be able to leave
that piano there.\\
89 - I'm going to put it over on that
wall.\\
90 - I want everything completely
different, you know?\\
91 - There.\\
92 - Oh, it just looks wonderful, Lucy.\\
93 - Isn't it beautiful?\\
94 - I'm going to make an entrance from
another room\\
95 - and see how it looks.\\
96 - Oh, this is the most beautiful room\\
97 - I've ever seen.\\
98 - FRED: Ethel?\\
99 - Yeah?\\
100 - Oh...\\
101 - (whistles)\\
102 - How do you like it?\\
103 - Gee, this new stuff is marvelous.\\
104 - Isn't it, though?\\
105 - Listen, Fred, would you do me a big
favor?\\
106 - Would you take a few little pieces of
furniture\\
107 - down to the basement for me?\\
108 - Sure. Where are they?\\
109 - Right out here.\\
110 - A few little pieces, huh?\\
111 - Well, it's not very much.\\
112 - If you just move this over a little
bit...\\
113 - (screaming)\\
114 - What's the matter?\\
115 - Something moved!
Something touched me!\\
116 - There's something alive in there!\\
117 - Alive?!
Yes, right there.\\
118 - Oh, that's impossible.\\
119 - It is not impossible.
It's me.\\
120 - Fred, what's the big idea?\\
121 - This is the craziest thing I've ever
seen yet.\\
122 - What's the idea of putting all the
furniture\\
123 - in the...?\\
124 - Well?\\
125 - Oh, it's real nice, honey.\\
126 - You don't like it?\\
127 - Oh, yes, I do, honey, I do.\\
128 - It's just I don't feel good today,
honey.\\
129 - I feel real bad.\\
130 - I got a sore throat and I...\\
131 - I think I'm catching a cold,
everything.\\
132 - Oh, you've been working too hard
redecorating that club.\\
133 - Yeah, maybe that is.\\
134 - Will you get me a couple of aspirins,
honey?\\
135 - Sure, dear, sure.\\
136 - Ethel, do you think I make a mistake\\
137 - putting that chair there?\\
138 - You know, my first impulse was to put
the chair here,\\
139 - have the table on this side...\\
140 - RICKY: Lucy, Lucy...\\
141 - What?\\
142 - Please, honey.\\
143 - I don't feel good.\\
144 - Get me the aspirins.\\
145 - I think I'm getting a strep-te-coccy.\\
146 - Oh, I'm sorry, dear.\\
147 - I didn't know it was so serious.\\
148 - Do you think you'll live\\
149 - till I get back from the kitchen?\\
150 - Get me the aspirins, please.\\
151 - Does Fred always act like a child\\
152 - when he gets ill?\\
153 - You mean, Baby Snooks?\\
154 - Oh, brother.\\
155 - Very funny.\\
156 - Yeah.\\
157 - Boy, it has to happen now.\\
158 - I got an opening coming up and
everything\\
159 - and now I got to get a sore throat.\\
160 - Oh, you'll be all right.\\
161 - Well, I want to make a good
impression\\
162 - on Mr. Chambers.\\
163 - Who's Mr. Chambers?\\
164 - He's the new owner of the Tropicana.\\
165 - Oh. Hey, Rick, does Lucy know\\
166 - that you're casting a new show?\\
167 - No. That's the good part about this
furniture deal.\\
168 - She's been so busy,\\
169 - she's not thinking about getting into
the act. Gee...\\
170 - Fred will take your furniture down a
little later, honey.\\
171 - Okay.\\
172 - Yeah. Ricky and I\\
173 - will carry it downstairs for you.\\
174 - Ricky isn't feeling well.\\
175 - Oh, he doesn't feel that bad.\\
176 - Do you, Rick?\\
177 - Aw, come on.
You're all right.\\
178 - Come on.\\
179 - (raspy voice): Well, if you insist,\\
180 - I'll take it down with you, Fred.\\
181 - Oh, never mind!\\
182 - I'll do it myself!\\
183 - Come on, Ethel!\\
184 - (imitating raspy voice)\\
185 - (laughs loudly)\\
186 - Honey, it is not funny.\\
187 - I don't feel too good.\\
188 - Oh, I'm sorry, dear. Here.\\
189 - There.\\
190 - Poor baby.\\
191 - Lucy?\\
192 - Lucy?\\
193 - Hi.\\
194 - How's Ricky this morning?\\
195 - He's dying.\\
196 - That's good.\\
197 - I thought it might be something
serious.\\
198 - Yeah. Honestly, Ethel, why are men
such babies?\\
199 - I wish I could get away with acting
like that.\\
200 - You said it.\\
201 - Last week Fred had a little headache\\
202 - and took to his bed\\
203 - and moaned he might not live through
the night.\\
204 - Remember when I broke my ankle last
year?\\
205 - He tried to get me out of bed the
second morning\\
206 - to fix his breakfast.\\
207 - He said walking would help the bone
heal.\\
208 - Lucy...\\
209 - Pardon me, Ethel.\\
210 - I'm wanted in surgery.\\
211 - I'll go scrub up in case you need me.\\
212 - What is it, dear?\\
213 - Oh, I-I feel worse.\\
214 - My-my throat is worse.\\
215 - I feel awful.
Mm-hmm.\\
216 - You want to look at it, please, for
me?\\
217 - Yes. Open up, dear.\\
218 - What you see?\\
219 - Oh...\\
220 - (clicks tongue)\\
221 - Uh? Uh? Uh?\\
222 - Wh-Wh-What do you see?\\
223 - Just as I thought.\\
224 - What?\\
225 - It's dark down there.\\
226 - I'll have to get the flashlight.\\
227 - All right.\\
228 - Get a flashlight.\\
229 - I don't know why this has to happen
to me now.\\
230 - I got the opening coming and
everything.\\
231 - You never put the flashlight in the
same place twice.\\
232 - I put it where you told me to put it\\
233 - the last time you said\\
234 - I didn't put it in the same place.\\
235 - All right, now let's take a look at
that throat.\\
236 - All right.\\
237 - Here I am, lying in a bed of pain\\
238 - and y-you making fun with me.\\
239 - I'm sick.\\
240 - All right, dear.\\
241 - Open up.\\
242 - Oh, boy, I wish you could see down in
here.\\
243 - It's so colorful.\\
244 - It's like the Carlsbad Cavern.\\
245 - Is it...? Is it red?\\
246 - Yeah. Red, white, blue, pink, burnt
orange.\\
247 - Now... don't-don't make fun, will
you?\\
248 - I don't feel good.\\
249 - Not only my throat, I mean, my...\\
250 - I got a cold, clammy feeling in my
stomach.\\
251 - A cold, clammy feeling on your
stomach?\\
252 - Yeah, I do.\\
253 - I have...
Oh, honey, no wonder.\\
254 - That's why.\\
255 - I'll probably catch pneumonia.\\
256 - I'd better change the clothes.\\
257 - I'll never be able to make that show.\\
258 - Babalu...\\
259 - Babalu-u-u...\\
260 - That's pretty baba-lousy.\\
261 - Never mind.\\
262 - Honey, are you sure you don't feel\\
263 - like eating a little breakfast?\\
264 - Oh, no. No.\\
265 - No? Well, you should have some
liquids.\\
266 - How about a little orange juice?\\
267 - All right, a little orange juice.\\
268 - Okay.\\
269 - And, uh...\\
270 - maybe a little coffee.\\
271 - Okay.\\
272 - Uh...\\
273 - M-maybe I could choke down one piece
of toast.\\
274 - Buttered.\\
275 - Yeah.\\
276 - I, uh...\\
277 - I really need my strength, you know.\\
278 - Maybe you should put some bacon with
it?\\
279 - Orange juice, toast, coffee, and
bacon.\\
280 - Yeah.\\
281 - Coming up.\\
282 - Uh, Lucy?\\
283 - How do you want them-- fried or
scrambled?\\
284 - Poached.\\
285 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
286 - Hi, Lucy.\\
287 - Oh, hi, kids.\\
288 - How's Ricky?\\
289 - Well, I called the doctor\\
290 - and it's a little more serious than I
thought.\\
291 - He has a virus that settled in his
throat.\\
292 - Oh, gee.
Is it bad?\\
293 - Well, the doctor said\\
294 - if he was going to be in the show,\\
295 - he'd have to stay in bed a whole week
and not talk.\\
296 - Not talk at all?\\
297 - Not a word.\\
298 - Gee. Imagine not being able to talk\\
299 - for seven whole days.\\
300 - Why don't you hang around here?\\
301 - Maybe you can catch it.\\
302 - Never mind.\\
303 - Let us know if there's anything we
can do.\\
304 - Okay.\\
305 - We'll check you later.\\
306 - Thanks. Bye-bye.
Good-bye.\\
307 - Ethel and Fred-- they came up to see
how you were.\\
308 - Here's your medicine.\\
309 - Doctor said you got to take your
medicine.\\
310 - Now, the doctor said you have to take
your medicine.\\
311 - Don't shout at me.\\
312 - Now, when I say you got to take
medicine,\\
313 - that means you got to take it.\\
314 - Now, Ricky...!
Look what you did.\\
315 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
316 - Now, look, if you're gonna act like a
child,\\
317 - I'm gonna treat you like one.\\
318 - Open your mouth!\\
319 - Open your mouth!\\
320 - Open it up!\\
321 - Never mind.\\
322 - Now, is there anything else I can do
for you or to you?\\
323 - Oh, this is silly.\\
324 - Write it.
Write it. Write it.\\
325 - No. This is silly.\\
326 - I got to go down there and stage the
show.\\
327 - I got to stage the show.\\
328 - Ricky, stay where you are.\\
329 - Let Mr. Chambers stage the show.\\
330 - Well, I can't ask him to do that.\\
331 - All right then, I'll ask him.\\
332 - I'll call him on the phone and ask
him.\\
333 - No, you know,\\
334 - this is too important for a telephone
call.\\
335 - I'm going to get dressed and go down
there\\
336 - and see him in person.\\
337 - You stay in that bed.\\
338 - Well...\\
339 - Well.\\
340 - Here I am, Lucy.
What'd you want?\\
341 - Oh, thanks for coming up, honey.\\
342 - Listen, I got to go down to the club
for Ricky.\\
343 - Will you stick around in case he
needs anything?\\
344 - Sure. What are you going down to the
club for?\\
345 - I'm going to see Mr. Chambers.\\
346 - You know how conscientious Ricky is.\\
347 - He's going to get out of that sickbed\\
348 - and go down there and stage that
show.\\
349 - Well, I'm going to ask Mr. Chambers
to stage it\\
350 - for himself.\\
351 - Oh. Well, good luck.\\
352 - Thanks. I'll need it.\\
353 - (phone rings)\\
354 - Hello?\\
355 - Hello. May I speak to Ricky Ricardo,
please?\\
356 - This is Mr. Chambers calling.\\
357 - Oh, Mr. Chambers, this is Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
358 - Ricky can't talk right now.
You see...\\
359 - Will you give him a message for me,
Mrs. Ricardo?\\
360 - You tell him I've been called out of
town for a few days.\\
361 - I ought to be back the day before the
opening.\\
362 - Tell him not to worry.\\
363 - I have every confidence that he'll
turn out a great show.\\
364 - But, Mr. Chambers...\\
365 - Yes?\\
366 - Uh... have a nice trip.\\
367 - Thank you...
thank you very much.\\
368 - Bye.\\
369 - Gee, Mr. Chambers is going out of
town.\\
370 - Oh... what's Ricky going to have to
say about that?\\
371 - Nothing. I'm not going to tell him.\\
372 - You're not going to tell him?\\
373 - Of course not.\\
374 - Well, then who's going to stage the
show?\\
375 - Who cares?\\
376 - I'm not letting Ricky out of that bed\\
377 - until the doctor says so\\
378 - if I have to stage a show myself.\\
379 - You wouldn't.\\
380 - Of course I wouldn't...\\
381 - would I?\\
382 - Well...\\
383 - Oh, it's crazy.\\
384 - Oh, sure, it's fantastic.\\
385 - What a thought.\\
386 - Of course, it would give me an
opportunity to hire some talent\\
387 - that has been grossly overlooked in
the past.\\
388 - You mean Fred and I could do one of
our dance routines?\\
389 - Right after my opening number.\\
390 - Oh!\\
391 - That is, if you're as good as you say
you are.\\
392 - What do you mean?\\
393 - You may audition for me\\
394 - the first thing in the morning.\\
395 - Oh, good! I'll go tell Fred.\\
396 - Yes. Yes, I understand, Doctor.\\
397 - Well, I'm glad that you agree.\\
398 - Yes, well...\\
399 - Lucy...\\
400 - Oh, well, thank you very much.\\
401 - Thank you.
Good-bye, Doctor.\\
402 - Fred will be up just a minute.\\
403 - He's got the act and the music and
everything.\\
404 - Good. I just talked the doctor\\
405 - into making Ricky stay in bed\\
406 - until opening night.\\
407 - That'll get him out of the way.\\
408 - He's not even going to get to come to
one rehearsal.\\
409 - Ricky still thinks\\
410 - that Mr. Chambers is staging the
show?\\
411 - Sure!
And Mr. Chambers\\
412 - still thinks Ricky's staging the
show.\\
413 - That's right.
Uh-oh.\\
414 - Now don't worry about Mr. Chambers.\\
415 - I think we can handle him.\\
416 - I hear he's an ex-vaudevillian.
Oh, good.\\
417 - Hi, kids.\\
418 - I got it.\\
419 - It was in the trunk-- the whole act:\\
420 - Words, music, orchestrations,\\
421 - gags, routines, everything!\\
422 - You're sure this is good, now?\\
423 - It was a smash when Ethel and I did
it at the palace.\\
424 - At the palace?!\\
425 - You're darn tootin'.\\
426 - That was the best theater\\
427 - in Jamestown, New York.\\
428 - "Flapper Follies of 1927."\\
429 - FRED: Yeah.\\
430 - You don't think maybe\\
431 - this might be a little out of date,
do you?\\
432 - Oh, no! That's what's wonderful about
it.\\
433 - They're reviving everything we did in
that show--\\
434 - ukuleles, the Charleston, even the
fashions.\\
435 - Gee, that's right.\\
436 - And I wish you could've seen those
showgirls.\\
437 - (whistling a catcall)\\
438 - Oh, That was the most beautiful line\\
439 - of showgirls I ever saw.\\
440 - Really?\\
441 - And here's another break we get--\\
442 - I called them up, and every one of
them\\
443 - was still available!\\
444 - Oh! Well, that's just wonderful.\\
445 - We got an awful lot of work to do\\
446 - before next Saturday.\\
447 - Oh! And I wish you could see\\
448 - the way Ricky has redecorated the
club for the opening.\\
449 - It is the most beautiful thing you've
ever seen.\\
450 - Listen, now you take this to Marco.\\
451 - Tell him to get the musicians ready.\\
452 - We got to talk about costumes.\\
453 - Wait till you see a blue dress I
found in the trunk\\
454 - that I used to wear in the act...\\

456 - (rimshot)\\

458 - (piano plays opening chord)\\
459 - There is sweetness in the call of a
woodland dove\\
460 - As her love song echoes through the
trees\\
461 - There is sweetness in a rose with its
symbol of love\\
462 - Floating on a summer breeze\\
463 - But nothing can compare with the
sweetness of\\
464 - The one and only one I love\\
465 - Yeah!\\
466 - Sweet...\\
467 - And lovely\\
468 - Sweeter than the roses in May\\
469 - And she loves me\\
470 - Heaven must have sent her my way\\
471 - I'm an angel!\\
472 - Skies above me\\
473 - Never were as blue as her eyes\\
474 - And she loves me\\
475 - Who would want a sweeter surprise?\\
476 - Surprise!
Surprise!
Surprise!\\
477 - When she nestles in my arms so
tenderly\\
478 - There's a thrill that words cannot
express\\
479 - In my heart, a song of love is
taunting me\\
480 - Melody\\
481 - Taunting me\\
482 - (music crescendos)\\
483 - Sweet and lovely\\
484 - Sweeter than the roses in May\\
485 - And she loves me\\

2 - Good morning, Lucy.\\
3 - Oh, hi, Ethel.\\
4 - Where are you going so early?\\
5 - Oh, I thought I'd go down and see the
doctor.\\
6 - What's the matter, honey, are you
sick?\\
7 - No, I just want to get a checkup.\\
8 - I need a tonic or something.\\
9 - I've been feeling real donsey.\\
10 - Donsey?\\
11 - Yeah. That's a word my grandmother
made up\\
12 - for when you're not really sick, but
you just feel lousy.\\
13 - Oh.\\
14 - Oh, I-I don't know what's the matter
with me.\\
15 - I've been getting a lot of rest, and
then\\
16 - I wake up feeling all dragged out in
the morning.\\
17 - I don't have much energy,\\
18 - and yet I've been putting on a lot of
weight.\\
19 - I just feel blah.\\
20 - Well, maybe you need some vitamin
pills\\
21 - or a liver shot or something.\\
22 - Yeah. Listen, don't tell Ricky that I
went to see the doctor.\\
23 - No sense worrying him.\\
24 - Okay.\\
25 - Gee, I-I'm going to have to go on a
diet.\\
26 - You know, I could hardly get into my
dress this morning.\\
27 - Hey, Lucy...\\
28 - Hmm?\\
29 - Wait a minute.\\
30 - You don't suppose...?\\
31 - I don't suppose what?\\
32 - You don't suppose you're going to
have a baby?\\
33 - Oh, of course not.\\
34 - (laughing)\\
35 - For heaven's sake.\\
36 - A baby?!\\
37 - Yeah. Baby.\\
38 - That's a word my grandmother made up\\
39 - for tiny little people.\\
40 - That's the silliest thing I ever
heard of.\\
41 - I've been married 11 years, Ethel.\\
42 - You were a lot closer\\
43 - when you said I needed liver shots.\\
44 - Well, we'll wait and see what the
doctor says.\\
45 - Oh, I got to go.\\
46 - I'll see you later.\\
47 - Good-bye, mummy.\\
48 - I'm going to wait right here until
you come back.\\
49 - Go on.\\
50 - Now, cut that out.\\
51 - Let's have no more kidding about me
having a baby.\\
52 - The whole thought is utterly
ridiculous.\\
53 - Lucy?\\
54 - What did the doctor say?\\
55 - Lucy?\\
56 - Oh, hi, Ethel.\\
57 - Hi, Lucy.\\
58 - What did the doctor say?\\
59 - Ethel...
we're going to have a baby.\\
60 - We are?!\\
61 - Oh...\\
62 - oh, isn't that wonderful?\\
63 - I... I never had a baby before.\\
64 - I mean, I've never been let in on it
so soon.\\
65 - Let in on it?\\
66 - Why, you knew it even before I did.\\
67 - This whole thing was practically your
idea.\\
68 - Aw!\\
69 - Gee...\\
70 - just think, Ethel.\\
71 - I'm going to be a mother.\\
72 - And I'm going to be a...\\
73 - I am going to be something, aren't I?\\
74 - Oh, sure, sure.\\
75 - Y-You and Fred will be the
godparents.\\
76 - Oh, isn't that exciting?\\
77 - Did the doctor say what it's going to
be?\\
78 - It's going to be a baby.\\
79 - No. I mean, I wonder\\
80 - if it's going to be a boy or a girl.\\
81 - Oh, I can't wait to find out\\
82 - whether I'm going to be a godmother
or a godfather.\\
83 - Wait till I tell Fred.\\
84 - He's going to be so excited!\\
85 - Oh, Ethel, Ethel, don't tell Fred.\\
86 - Why not?\\
87 - Because I haven't told Ricky yet,\\
88 - and he'd feel awful if Fred knew
before he did.\\
89 - Why haven't you told Ricky?\\
90 - Well... because I-I want to tell him\\
91 - in a very special way.\\
92 - All my life, I've dreamed\\
93 - about how I was going to tell my
husband\\
94 - when we were going to have a baby.\\
95 - I've known exactly what I was going
to say to him.\\
96 - I've dreamed about it a million
times.\\
97 - Aw....\\
98 - Now it's going to come true.\\
99 - See, h-he'll be sitting right here,
see?\\
100 - And then...
and then I-I'll come over,\\
101 - and I'll...
I'll sit on his lap.\\
102 - And I'll put my arms around his neck,\\
103 - and I'll say\\
104 - Ricky... darling...\\
105 - our dream has come true.\\
106 - You and I are going to be blessed
with something\\
107 - that means more to us\\
108 - than anything in the whole world.\\
109 - Well, I shouldn't be here at a time
like this.\\
110 - What?\\
111 - Uh... I mean,\\
112 - I'll come back after you've told
Ricky.\\
113 - Oh, he ought to be home for lunch any
minute.\\
114 - He's going to be so thrilled!\\
115 - Oh, Lucy! Oh!\\
116 - (both stomping their feet)\\
117 - (sighing)\\
118 - Hi, honey.\\
119 - Oh, hello, Ricky.\\
120 - Uh, I thought you'd never get here.\\
121 - What are you talking about?\\
122 - I'm ten minutes early.\\
123 - Oh, yeah.
(chuckles)\\
124 - H-How's everything, darling?\\
125 - Everything's terrible.\\
126 - Oh, good.\\
127 - Good?\\
128 - I said everything was terrible.\\
129 - Huh? Oh, terrible.\\
130 - Yeah, terrible.\\
131 - I don't think I'll ever put on\\
132 - another nightclub show as long as I
live.\\
133 - The lights are all wrong.\\
134 - The costumes are all wrong.\\
135 - Nobody knows their number.\\
136 - Nothing good happened today.\\
137 - Well, it will, dear.\\
138 - You come over here and sit down.\\
139 - See? I fixed lunch in here.\\
140 - It's cozier and comfyer.\\
141 - Oh, gee, honey, that looks wonderful.\\
142 - Yeah, well, just relax, dear.\\
143 - I'm all right, honey.\\
144 - I'm just hungry.\\
145 - Sit back, dear.
Sit back.\\
146 - Yes, dear.\\
147 - Ricky...\\
148 - Ricky, darling...\\
149 - What is it, honey?\\
150 - Give me that.\\
151 - Now, swallow.\\
152 - There.\\
153 - (loud crunching)\\
154 - Ricky, do you have to eat now?\\
155 - Well, honey, it's lunchtime.\\
156 - You fixed me a beautiful lunch.\\
157 - Well, stop for a minute.\\
158 - Now, swallow that.\\
159 - My stomach is going to think I lost
my teeth.\\
160 - All right, honey.\\
161 - Now, what is it?\\
162 - Ricky... darling...\\
163 - (phone ringing)\\
164 - Honey, the phone is ringing.\\
165 - I know it.\\
166 - Well, honey, one of us has to get up\\
167 - and answer it.\\
168 - No!\\
169 - Lucy...\\
170 - Let it ring.
Oh, honey, come on.\\
171 - It might be important, honey.\\
172 - Oh...\\
173 - Come on, sweetheart.\\
174 - (ringing continues)\\
175 - Hello?\\
176 - Oh, hello, Marco.\\
177 - What?!\\
178 - What do you mean,\\
179 - they can't have the costumes there\\
180 - till tonight?\\
181 - Now, look, you tell that guy\\
182 - that he has to have those costumes
there\\
183 - by 2:00 this afternoon or I'm going
to sue him.\\
184 - That's what I said-- I'm going to sue
him.\\
185 - And-and look,\\
186 - will you have the orchestra there\\
187 - on time for a change?\\
188 - I don't care how you do it.\\
189 - Just get 'em there, eh?\\
190 - Thanks. Good-bye.\\
191 - Oh, what a business.\\
192 - Sometimes I think I'll go back to
Cuba\\
193 - and work in a sugar plantation.\\
194 - Just the two of us.\\
195 - Just the two of us?\\
196 - Yeah.\\
197 - I don't mind to get you all involved\\
198 - in my affairs, honey,\\
199 - but you should be happy you're a
woman.\\
200 - Oh, I am, I am.\\
201 - Oh, you-you think that you know how
tough my job is,\\
202 - but believe me, if you traded places
with me,\\
203 - you'd be surprised.\\
204 - Believe me, if I traded places with
you, you'd be surprised.\\
205 - Uh, honey, what is this all about,
huh?\\
206 - What's the matter?\\
207 - Nothing, dear.\\
208 - I just love you, that's all.\\
209 - Uh-oh.\\
210 - How much are you overdrawn?\\
211 - I am not overdrawn.\\
212 - I want to tell you something.\\
213 - Lucy, what did you buy?\\
214 - Nothing!\\
215 - Ricky... darling...\\
216 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
217 - Oh, I'll get it.\\
218 - Who was that?\\
219 - Nobody.\\
220 - Now, how can nobody ring the
doorbell?\\
221 - Well, I think it was probably...\\
222 - Nobody's necktie is caught in the
door.\\
223 - I'll get it.\\
224 - Nah, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.\\
225 - I'll get it.\\
226 - Whose father got...\\
227 - It's Ricky.
Hi, Ricky.\\
228 - Hi, Rick.\\
229 - Now, what's going on here?\\
230 - Why'd you slam the door in their
face?\\
231 - Well, I...
ETHEL: Oh, that's all right.\\
232 - I-I don't think you should be
disturbed\\
233 - while you're eating your lunch.\\
234 - No, Ricky, go ahead and have your
lunch.
We can come back.\\
235 - We can come back later.
Oh, come on, will you?!\\
236 - Come in.
Why everybody acting so silly?\\
237 - Now, come on and sit down.\\
238 - I want to talk to you. Come on.\\
239 - Come on, will you?\\
240 - Sit down, Fred.\\
241 - All right.\\
242 - Fred, I want to tell you something.\\
243 - You don't know how smart you are\\
244 - that you got out of show business.\\
245 - Oh?\\
246 - You should have been at the club
today.\\
247 - Everything went wrong.\\
248 - First of all, you know that costume
shop...\\
249 - ...and not only that,\\
250 - but the guy in the spotlight\\
251 - has the nerve to tell me\\
252 - that I told him not to light me
during my number\\
253 - but to go around looking for
interesting faces\\
254 - in the audience.\\
255 - (chuckling): Oh, no.\\
256 - Yeah, well, do you folks really have
to go?\\
257 - Oh, yes, we really do.
Yeah, I guess.\\
258 - We'll see you later, Ricky.\\
259 - Come on, Fred.\\
260 - Yeah, okay.
(clears throat)\\
261 - Good-bye.\\
262 - Hey, Fred, how about the fights?\\
263 - Everything's all right.\\
264 - I've taken care of it, Rick.\\
265 - I told...\\
266 - Honey, he was still talking.\\
267 - Honey...\\
268 - Honey, I-I want to talk to you.\\
269 - Lucy, what do you sit on when I'm not
home?\\
270 - (giggling)\\
271 - Ricky... darling...\\
272 - (phone rings)\\
273 - Darn that thing!\\
274 - Lucy, you're sure acting strange.\\
275 - What's the matter, honey?\\
276 - Come on, let me answer the phone.\\
277 - Maybe it's important.
Oh...\\
278 - Hello?\\
279 - Yeah, yeah.\\
280 - What?!\\
281 - What do you mean?\\
282 - Of course the club has\\
283 - an automatic dishwashing machine.\\
284 - We just put it in.\\
285 - What?!\\
286 - I got to pay for standby dishwashers?\\
287 - Aw, now, wait a minute.\\
288 - No-no-no, d-don't do anything, would
you?\\
289 - I'll be right down.\\
290 - Just hold everything.
I'll be right down.\\
291 - Good-bye.\\
292 - But Ricky, can't you stay a few more
minutes?\\
293 - Honey, I'm sorry, honey,\\
294 - but this is union trouble I got to
take care of.\\
295 - Standby dishwashers they want, yet.\\
296 - Thanks for the lunch, honey.\\
297 - Yeah, but, Ricky, Ricky,\\
298 - I want to talk to you about
something.\\
299 - Well, look, sweetheart, whatever it
is,\\
300 - use your own judgment.\\
301 - Now, if... if you think it's a good
idea,\\
302 - go ahead with it.\\
303 - (door closes)\\
304 - I just saw Ricky leaving.\\
305 - That didn't take long.
What did he say?\\
306 - Nothing.
I haven't told him yet.\\
307 - You haven't?
Why not?\\
308 - Because I kept being interrupted\\
309 - by telephones, sandwiches, and...\\
310 - certain busybodies.\\
311 - Well, thanks.\\
312 - Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.\\
313 - Oh, that's all right.\\
314 - You're bound to be a little cranky\\
315 - in your condition.\\
316 - I am not cranky!\\
317 - Of course not.\\
318 - Well, I'm not!\\
319 - That's right.\\
320 - Come on. I'll help you with the
dishes.\\
321 - (dishes clattering)\\
322 - Fred, what is all that?\\
323 - Well, I want to get the little fella\\
324 - started off right.\\
325 - Oh, Fred, for heaven's sake.\\
326 - Here, Lucy.
For my godson.\\
327 - Oh... gee, thanks, Fred.\\
328 - Oh, she doesn't want all that junk.\\
329 - Junk? Do you realize\\
330 - that that's an honest-to-goodness\\
331 - Yankee ball cap?\\
332 - Huh! Junk...\\
333 - And wait till you see the name on
this.\\
334 - That's the name of the best
ballplayer\\
335 - the Yankees ever had.\\
336 - Oh. "Spaulding."\\
337 - No, honey, turn it around.\\
338 - Oh! "Joe DiMaggio!"\\
339 - You betcha.\\
340 - Old Joltin' Joe himself.\\
341 - Ah, gee, Fred.\\
342 - I bet these things meant a lot to
you.\\
343 - You shouldn't be giving them to us.\\
344 - Aw, why not? There's nothing too good
for little Freddie.\\
345 - Aw...\\
346 - (chuckling)\\
347 - You mean, there's nothing too good\\
348 - for little Ethel.\\
349 - That baby's name is going to be Fred.\\
350 - How can they call little Ethel
"Fred"?\\
351 - Oh, now wait a minute.
Just a minute.\\
352 - We're getting a little ahead of
ourselves, aren't we?\\
353 - The baby won't be here for quite a
while, you know.\\
354 - (chuckling): That's right.\\
355 - Yeah, I guess you're right there.\\
356 - There's plenty of time to name him
Fred.\\
357 - Yeah.
(chuckles)\\
358 - Ah, I bet Ricky was thrilled, huh,
Lucy?\\
359 - She didn't get a chance to tell him.\\
360 - You didn't?\\
361 - No.\\
362 - I'm going down to the club and tell
him.\\
363 - Oh, Lucy, that won't be the way\\
364 - you've always planned it.\\
365 - Well, I can't help it.
Ricky's got to know.\\
366 - And if I don't tell Ricky soon,\\
367 - I might as well wait and let the baby
tell him.\\
368 - (orchestra tuning up)\\
369 - All right, all right.\\
370 - All right, fellas.\\
371 - Let's, uh, let's try "Granada," huh?\\
372 - You got it in there?\\
373 - What's the number of that?\\
374 - And listen, I want to check this mic,

23 - and it's all about infant care,\\
24 - and you have to practice with a doll,\\
25 - so you know everything there is to do
before the baby gets here.\\
26 - Oh.\\
27 - You have to practice, too.\\
28 - Really?
Yeah.\\
29 - Isn't it cute?\\
30 - (chuckles)\\
31 - (chuckles)\\
32 - Is this, uh...\\
33 - little Scott or Pamela Ricardo?\\
34 - Scott or Pamela...\\
35 - Do you really like those names,
Ricky?\\
36 - Now, Lucy!\\
37 - For weeks we've been going over and
over and over\\
38 - thousands of names.\\
39 - I'm so confused, I don't know what my
name is.\\
40 - Now, last night we decided finally,
both of us, that\\
41 - the baby's name is going to be Scott
if it's a boy\\
42 - and they just don't go with Ricardo.\\
43 - All right, then, let's change
Ricardo.\\
44 - That'd be easier.
No.\\
45 - Now, look, this is nothing to joke
about, Ricky.\\
46 - It's a terrible thing to go
through...\\
47 - go through life with the wrong name--\\
48 - the poor little baby.\\
49 - All right, all right.\\
50 - What are their names now?\\
51 - Gregory or Joanne.\\
52 - Good, Gregory or Joanne.\\
53 - Isn't Gregory a beautiful name?\\
54 - Yeah, honey, beautiful, uh-huh.\\
55 - So is Joanne.\\
56 - Joanne...\\
57 - Jo-anne...\\
58 - Ricky, do you really think Joanne...\\
59 - Gregory or Joanne!\\
60 - Now, Lucy, I don't care what you name
the baby,\\
61 - but we got to get it settled.\\
62 - Well, I'm not going to settle on just
any old thing.\\
63 - I want the names to be unique and
euphonious.\\
64 - Okay, Unique if it is a boy,\\
65 - and Euphonious if it is a girl.\\
66 - For your information, those are not
names, they're words.\\
67 - Well, they're the prettiest ones
you've mentioned yet.\\
68 - How about Gregory if it's a boy
and...\\
69 - and Cynthia if it's a girl?\\
70 - That's fine, honey.\\
71 - Still, I always liked the name Philip
for a boy.\\
72 - How about Philip for a boy...\\
73 - And Morris if it's a girl?\\
74 - Oh, Ricky!\\
75 - Now, honey, forget about the names.\\
76 - You're gonna go to bed, come on.\\
77 - No, I'm not, not till we get this
settled.\\
78 - I'll sleep late in the morning.\\
79 - Lucy, you're going to bed.\\
80 - No, no, honest, I'll go back to bed\\
81 - right after I get your breakfast.\\
82 - You're not going to get my breakfast.\\
83 - Who is?\\
84 - I am, and what's more,\\
85 - I'm going to get your breakfast, too.\\
86 - Oh, really?\\
87 - Absolutely.\\
88 - There's nothing too good for the
mother of my child.\\
89 - (laughing): Oh, honey!\\
90 - Come on, honey, you got to take it
easy.\\
91 - Now, come on, you got to go to bed.\\
92 - Come on.
Okay.\\
93 - (sighs)\\
94 - Oh, Ricky!\\
95 - I've got the perfect names, something
very simple:\\
96 - John or Mary.\\
97 - That's fine, honey.\\
98 - John or Mary.\\
99 - Oh, I'm glad that's settled.\\
100 - Good.\\
101 - Ricky?\\
102 - Ricky?\\
103 - Good morning, honey.\\
104 - Good morning.\\
105 - Just getting ready to cook you
breakfast.\\
106 - Oh, I forgot about that.\\
107 - Well.
(chuckles)\\
108 - Are you hungry?\\
109 - Oh, starved.\\
110 - After all, I'm eating for me\\
111 - and little Romeo or Juliet.\\
112 - Romeo or Juliet?\\
113 - Yeah. Aren't they beautiful names?\\
114 - What happened to John and Mary?\\
115 - Well, I got to thinking last night--
Mary's all right,\\
116 - but every Tom, Dick and Harry's named
John.\\
117 - All right, I give up.\\
118 - What do you want for breakfast?\\
119 - Oh...\\
120 - How about waffles?\\
121 - Oh, no, honey, don't bother.\\
122 - But you like them so much.\\
123 - Oh, but they're too much trouble.\\
124 - Well, won't be any trouble for you.\\
125 - You just stay right here and take it
easy,\\
126 - and I'll take care of everything.\\
127 - Oh!
I want you to have your favorite
breakfast:\\
128 - waffles.\\
129 - Okay.\\
130 - I'll have them for you in a jiffy.\\
131 - All right.\\
132 - You just stay there and rest now.\\
133 - I will, dear.
All right.\\
134 - (sighs)\\
135 - Lucy?\\
136 - Yeah?\\
137 - Where's the waffle iron?\\
138 - It's in that cabinet under the sink.\\
139 - Oh.\\
140 - It's not there, honey.\\
141 - Are you sure, dear?\\
142 - Yeah.
Did you look way in the back?\\
143 - Yeah, I looked all over the place.
Not there.\\
144 - Well, I must have put it up here.\\
145 - Hey, honey, wait, wait!\\
146 - Honey, you can't climb up that.\\
147 - You're supposed to be resting.\\
148 - Okay.\\
149 - I know I saw it around here this
morning someplace.\\
150 - Ricky!\\
151 - Oh, there it is!\\
152 - Yeah. What are you trying to do,
start a fire?\\
153 - Honey, I didn't even see it.\\
154 - I just plugged the coffeepot...\\
155 - Oh.\\
156 - Well, uh, you go on to bed.\\
157 - I'll fix you waffles.\\
158 - Okay.\\
159 - Lucy?\\
160 - Yeah?\\
161 - Where's the waffle mix?\\
162 - It's in that cupboard with the flour
and the cereals.\\
163 - I know, honey, it isn't there.\\
164 - Are you sure?\\
165 - Yeah, honey, I looked all over the
place.\\
166 - You looked up in here behind the
cans?\\
167 - I looked up in there and every place,
it's not there.\\
168 - Well, I don't know where else it
could be.\\
169 - What's this?\\
170 - Oh, waffle mix.\\
171 - Yeah.\\
172 - How did that get there?
Magic.\\
173 - Lucy?\\
174 - Where's the salt?\\
175 - Ricky, do me a favor, will you?\\
176 - Don't cook breakfast for me this
morning.\\
177 - I'm not strong enough.\\
178 - Hi, Rick.\\
179 - Oh, hiya, Fred.\\
180 - What're you doing?\\
181 - Well, I was...\\
182 - I was cooking breakfast for Lucy.\\
183 - Attaboy, we got to take care of Lucy
and little Fred.\\
184 - Well, uh, don't count on the baby
being called Fred.\\
185 - She's changed her mind every three
seconds.\\
186 - Naturally. That's because she's gonna
have a baby.\\
187 - Do they all act that way?\\
188 - Of course.
Expectant mothers are\\
189 - the most unpredictable creatures in
the world.\\
190 - Yeah, well, Lucy sure is.\\
191 - You know, I got up this morning\\
192 - and I offered to cook her waffles.\\
193 - And then suddenly, for no reason at
all,\\
194 - she said she doesn't want me to cook
her breakfast.\\
195 - Oh?\\
196 - I'm telling you, being an expectant
father\\
197 - is pretty tough on a man.\\
198 - Yeah, but you got to go along with
it.\\
199 - Sure. In a minute or so,\\
200 - she'll probably say that she wants
breakfast.\\
201 - So, I'll just forget her
unpredictable behavior\\
202 - and turn the other chick.\\
203 - Chick?\\
204 - Yeah.\\
205 - Is that what you're having for
breakfast?\\
206 - Chick, chick-- the outside of your
face.\\
207 - Oh... cheek!\\
208 - That's what I said.\\
209 - You want to help me?\\
210 - Sure, I'll help you.\\
211 - Get me some milk and some eggs there,
will you?\\
212 - Sure.\\
213 - Lucy?\\
214 - Lucy?\\
215 - Hi.\\
216 - Hi!\\
217 - Having breakfast in bed!\\
218 - Yeah. Ricky and Fred cooked waffles
for me this morning.\\
219 - They did?\\
220 - How were they?\\
221 - Well, I don't know.
You want to try one?\\
222 - How could they serve you a thing like
that?\\
223 - They said this one turned out\\
224 - better than the others.
Oh, no.\\
225 - Yeah, they explained that the
charcoal\\
226 - would be good for the baby's teeth.\\
227 - I suppose they left a few dishes in
the kitchen.\\
228 - Come on, let's see.\\
229 - Okay.\\
230 - Oh, Lucy!\\
231 - Now, you think they'd get one good
waffle out of all this.\\
232 - Oh, well.\\
233 - I'll help you clean it up.\\
234 - Whoo!\\
235 - Ho, hum.\\
236 - This is a fine way for you to rest.\\
237 - Oh, I really don't mind.\\
238 - Ricky meant well.\\
239 - It's just the idea that counts.\\
240 - Yeah.\\
241 - This shows how much he loves me.\\
242 - You know, it's amazing the way he
fusses over me\\
243 - and takes care of me since we've been
expecting the baby.\\
244 - Well, that's one thing you can be
sure of.\\
245 - Ricky really loves you all right.\\
246 - Yeah.\\
247 - Ethel.\\
248 - What?\\
249 - Now that I think of it,\\
250 - he never treated me this nice when it
was just me.\\
251 - What do you mean?\\
252 - It's just the baby he loves.\\
253 - Oh, don't be silly.\\
254 - It is, it's little Sharon or
Pierrepont.\\
255 - That's all that counts.\\
256 - Oh, Lucy, you're just being crazy.\\
257 - I am not.\\
258 - You are, too.\\
259 - He's only taking care of me because
of the baby.\\
260 - He doesn't love me.\\
261 - Now, Lucy...\\
262 - I don't count at all.\\
263 - After the baby's born, I'll just be
forgotten.\\
264 - Oh, that's not true.\\
265 - It is so true.\\
266 - I'll be just like a salmon.\\
267 - I'll swim upstream, spawn, and never
be heard from again!\\
268 - ETHEL (whispering): Ricky? Ricky?\\
269 - Oh, hi, Ethel.\\
270 - Where have you been?\\
271 - I've been trying to get hold of you
all afternoon.\\
272 - Oh, I was out shopping all day.\\
273 - I brought Lucy some presents.\\
274 - Lucy? Oh, thank goodness for that.\\
275 - Why, what's the matter?\\
276 - She's been moping around all day.\\
277 - She's got a crazy idea that instead
of being...\\
278 - Hi, honey.\\
279 - (coldly): Hello.\\
280 - I-I-I brought some presents for you.\\
281 - For me?\\
282 - Yeah.\\
283 - Here, honey.\\
284 - Open that one.\\
285 - Just what I've always wanted.\\
286 - It's a rattle.\\
287 - Yeah.\\
288 - Here, honey, open that one.\\
289 - Does this do anything for me, Ethel?\\
290 - Now, Lucy.\\
291 - Honey, it's for the baby.\\
292 - Oh, yes, of course.\\
293 - I should've rea...\\
294 - Oh, oh, then, these are for me.\\
295 - No, no, honey, those are for the
baby, too.\\
296 - You don't seem to get the idea.\\
297 - I get the idea all right.\\
298 - Thanks for the presents.\\
299 - (wails)\\
300 - Well, now, what's the matter?\\
301 - I can't figure her out these days.\\
302 - She's upset; she thinks all you care
about is the baby\\
303 - and that you don't love her anymore.\\
304 - Why, that's ridiculous.\\
305 - Only this morning I fixed her
breakfast in bed.\\
306 - That's because she's gonna have a
baby.\\
307 - She wants you to do something for
her.\\
308 - What do you mean?\\
309 - Well, why don't you take her out for
an evening?\\
310 - Take her dining, take her dancing.\\
311 - Dancing?\\
312 - In her condition?\\
313 - Sure. Why not?\\
314 - Well, all right,\\
315 - if you think it's the thing to do.\\
316 - Sure, I'd love to take her out dining
and dancing.\\
317 - I'll take her down to the club
tonight.\\
318 - Oh, that's great.\\
319 - Uh, why don't you take another couple
along?\\
320 - You know, just to make it a real
happy foursome?\\
321 - Anyone special you have in mind?\\
322 - We'd love to.\\
323 - Lucy?\\
324 - Yeah?\\
325 - This just came for you.\\
326 - For me?\\
327 - It looks like a corsage.\\
328 - Sure, open it.\\
329 - Oh, Ethel, look!\\
330 - It's an orchid.\\
331 - Oh, isn't it beautiful?\\
332 - Listen to this: "My darling,\\
333 - no flower I could send would be half
as lovely as you."\\
334 - I wonder who it's from.\\
335 - Isn't it signed?\\
336 - Yeah, it says Ricky, but Ricky who?\\
337 - Ricky Ricardo.\\
338 - Oh.\\
339 - Well, then it must be for the baby.\\
340 - Now, Lucy, stop being silly.\\
341 - You know this is for you.\\
342 - For little old me?\\
343 - I mean, little old big me?\\
344 - (buzzer sounds)\\
345 - Mrs. Ricardo?\\
346 - Yes?
A package for you.\\
347 - Thank you.\\
348 - Ethel, look, candy!\\
349 - Oh, boy.\\
350 - "Darling, sweets to the sweet.\\
351 - Devotedly, lover boy."\\
352 - Aw, isn't that cute?\\
353 - I wonder who this is from.\\
354 - Now, Lucy...\\
355 - Well, I suppose it's from Ricky.\\
356 - You know darn well it is.\\
357 - Well, it could be from somebody else,
you know,\\
358 - except that I happen to recognize his
handwriting,\\
359 - and I don't know any other lover boy.\\
360 - (phone rings)\\
361 - Hello?\\
362 - Hello, sweetheart.\\
363 - How's my beautiful girl?\\
364 - Uh... what number were you calling,
please?\\
365 - Lucy, this is me-- lover boy.\\
366 - Who is it?
Who is it?\\
367 - It's the same crazy fool\\
368 - that sent the flowers and candy.\\
369 - What were you calling about, please?\\
370 - I just miss you, that's all.\\
371 - Do you?\\
372 - Yeah. I want to talk to you.\\
373 - How are you?\\
374 - Oh, I'm fine. How are you?\\
375 - Fine, honey.\\
376 - Listen, I hate to think of not seeing
you tonight.\\
377 - So, why don't you come down to the
club\\
378 - and have dinner with me, huh?\\
379 - He wants me to come down to the club
and have dinner with him.\\
380 - Oh, I'd love to, dear.\\
381 - Good. I'll get a nice ringside table\\
382 - and you can stay afterwards and we
can dance for a while.\\
383 - And dancing afterward.\\
384 - Oh, that would be wonderful, darling.\\
385 - Good. You want to ask Fred and Ethel
to be with us?\\
386 - Okay.\\
387 - Ethel...
We'd love to.\\
388 - You'd love to what?\\
389 - I haven't asked you anything yet.\\
390 - Oh, uh, well, uh, what were you going
to ask me?\\
391 - Would you like to go with us?\\
392 - Yes, we'd love to.\\
393 - They'd love to.\\
394 - Good. I'll see you around 8:00, huh?\\
395 - All right.\\
396 - Good-bye, angel.\\
397 - Good-bye, sweetheart.\\
398 - I love you.\\
399 - He loves me. Me!\\
400 - (slow dance music playing)\\
401 - (music)\\
402 - (music)\\
403 - (music ends)\\
404 - (applause)\\
405 - Oh, isn't this fun?\\
406 - I haven't been dancing in ages.\\
407 - Oh, we ought to do this more often.\\
408 - Oh, boy, I love to dance,\\
409 - but I haven't danced in a while.\\
410 - I'm a little out of condition.\\
411 - A little out of condition?\\
412 - He puffs so much,\\
413 - it's like dancing with a steam
engine.\\
414 - (laughs)\\
415 - Steam engines always puff\\
416 - when they're pushing a heavy load.\\
417 - Is that so?\\
418 - Now, listen, Fred...\\
419 - Now, now, now, wait a minute,\\
420 - you two, no bickering.\\
421 - I'm having a wonderful time.\\
422 - I don't want anything to spoil this
evening.\\
423 - We're not bickering, that's how we
make love.\\
424 - (orchestra begins playing "Dancing
Cheek to Cheek")\\
425 - Lucy, this is our dance.\\
426 - Oh, do you mind, Ethel?\\
427 - No. Go ahead, trip the heavy
fantastic.\\
428 - Ethel...\\
429 - I got to hand it to you.\\
430 - You sure were right.\\
431 - Yeah. All she wanted was a little
attention.\\
432 - She's so happy.\\
433 - Yeah. Listen.\\
434 - Do you think Fred will mind if I cut
in on him?\\
435 - This is our favorite number.\\
436 - No, go ahead.\\
437 - May I?\\
438 - Heaven\\
439 - I'm in heaven\\
440 - And my heart beats so that I can
hardly speak\\
441 - And I seem to find the happiness I
seek\\
442 - When we're out together dancing cheek
to cheek\\
443 - Heaven\\
444 - I'm in heaven\\
445 - And the cares that hung around me\\
446 - Through the week\\
447 - Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky
streak\\
448 - When we're out together dancing cheek
to cheek\\
449 - Oh, I love to climb a mountain\\
450 - And to reach the highest peak\\
451 - But it doesn't thrill me half as much\\
452 - As dancing cheek to cheek\\
453 - Oh, I love to go out fishing\\
454 - On a river or a creek\\
455 - Yeah, man!\\
456 - I don't enjoy it half as much\\
457 - As dancing cheek to cheek\\
458 - Dance with me\\
459 - I want my arms around you\\
460 - The charm about you\\
461 - Will carry me through\\
462 - Heaven\\
463 - I'm in heaven\\
464 - And my heart beats so that I can
hardly speak\\
465 - And I seem to find the happiness I
seek\\
466 - When we're out together dancing\\
467 - Cheek to cheek.\\
468 - (song ends, crowd applauds)\\
469 - Oh, isn't this fun?\\
470 - You were the handsomest couple on the
floor.\\
471 - Well, that's because\\
472 - I was dancing with my lovely wife.\\
473 - Honey, what's the matter?\\
474 - ETHEL: Oh, she's crying 'cause she's
so happy.\\
475 - Are you?\\
476 - No.\\
477 - Honey, what's wrong?\\
478 - You haven't mentioned the baby once
tonight.\\
479 - You don't love little Robert or
Madelyn.\\

1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Yeah, yeah...\\
3 - yeah, that'll be all right.\\
4 - Okay, now, let's see, what else do we
need?\\
5 - Barbershop quartet. Okay.\\
6 - Hi, Rick.\\
7 - Oh, hi.\\
8 - A barbershop quartet-- yeah, that's
right.\\
9 - Listen, uh... how much will that
cost?\\
10 - What?!\\
11 - Look, I only want a quartet.\\
12 - I don't want the whole Metropolitan
Opera Company.\\
13 - Look, I don't want you to think\\
14 - that I'm a tight skate.\\
15 - (louder): Tight skate.\\
16 - Cheap wad.\\
17 - Well, you know what I'm talking
about.\\
18 - All right, well, look, they're only
singers.\\
19 - See if you can get them to work
cheaper than that.\\
20 - Okay, good-bye.\\
21 - Hey, Rick, you looking for singers?\\
22 - Good ones that'll work cheap?\\
23 - Yeah, I'm putting on a new show.\\
24 - If I'd known what I was getting into,\\
25 - I would have never...\\
26 - BOTH: Ta-da!\\
27 - Oh, no.\\
28 - Presenting...\\
29 - Those incomparable exponents of
mellifluous melody...\\
30 - Heartwarming harmony...\\
31 - And appropriate terpsichore...\\
32 - BOTH: The Merry Mertzes.\\
33 - Now look, Fred, Ethel...\\
34 - Oh, come on, now, Ricky,\\
35 - you used us once, and we were good,
remember?\\
36 - Yeah!\\
37 - Oh, nothing could be finer than to be
in Carolina\\
38 - In the mo-wo-worning\\
39 - No one could be sweeter than my
sweetie when I meet her\\
40 - In the mo-wo-worning...\\
41 - All right, all right, hold it, hold
it.\\
42 - and I'll give you an audition.\\
43 - Oh, fine! What kind of a show is it
going to be?\\
44 - It's going to be a gay '90s revue.\\
45 - ETHEL: That ought to be fun.\\
46 - FRED: Great.\\
47 - You know, we didn't have the gay '90s\\
48 - in Cuba like you did over here.\\
49 - What were they like, Fred?\\
50 - I don't know.\\
51 - That was before my time.\\
52 - Ask Ethel.\\
53 - We shouldn't be talking about a new
show.\\
54 - Lucy might hear us.\\
55 - So what? In her condition,\\
56 - she wouldn't want to be in the show.\\
57 - She wouldn't?\\
58 - RICKY: Of course not.\\
59 - Oh, I can understand that.\\
60 - Her figure has changed quite a bit,
you know.\\
61 - Sure.\\
62 - While strolling through the park one
day\\
63 - In the merry, merry month of May\\
64 - I was taken by surprise\\
65 - By a pair of roguish eyes\\
66 - And you can put that parasol away,
bom, bom.\\
67 - Now, Ricky, if Fred and Ethel are
going to be in your show,\\
68 - there's no reason why I can't be in
it, too.\\
69 - Now, look, wait a minute.\\
70 - In the first place,\\
71 - I have not definitely promised Fred
and Ethel\\
72 - that they're going to be in the show.\\
73 - And in the second place,\\
74 - I can definitely promise you\\
75 - that you're not going to be in it.\\
76 - But Ricky...\\
77 - You're going to have a baby,
remember?\\
78 - Of course I remember.
That's just the point.\\
79 - After I have the baby, I'll have\\
80 - to stay home and take care of it.\\
81 - I'll never be able to be in a show
again.\\
82 - Hey, I never thought about it that
way.\\
83 - Sure, it'll sort of be my show
business farewell.\\
84 - My show business swan song.\\
85 - Lucy, the answer is no.\\
86 - Would you begrudge an expectant swan
her song?\\
87 - You seem to forget\\
88 - that this particular swan has no
talent.\\
89 - Oh, no? What time is that rehearsal
tomorrow?\\
90 - You're not going to be there, so just
forget it.\\
91 - No?\\
92 - No, I said no, I'm not going to be
there.\\
93 - Sir, you dare not strike a mother.\\
94 - Lucy?\\
95 - I'm in the closet, Ethel,\\
96 - trying to find a costume for my
audition today.\\
97 - Oh, no, Lucy, you're not really going
to go down there\\
98 - and audition, are you?\\
99 - I certainly am.\\
100 - Trying to find a costume\\
101 - that won't be too revealing.\\
102 - How's this?\\
103 - Well, I guess that's not too
revealing.\\
104 - What number are you going to do?\\
105 - Oh, I never thought about that.\\
106 - I could sing "Roll Out the Barrel."\\
107 - You could, but it's not a gay '90s
song.\\
108 - Oh.\\
109 - How about "Put On Your Old Gray
Barrel"?\\
110 - "I'm Only a Bird in a Gilded..."\\
111 - No?\\
112 - No.\\
113 - Oh, well, I guess you're right.\\
114 - This won't work.\\
115 - Hey, where'd everybody go?\\
116 - Don't stand there laughing, get me
out me out of this thing.\\
117 - I can't move.\\
118 - Okay. Hello, down there.\\
119 - Hello.\\
120 - Move up a little.\\
121 - Oh, ow, uh.\\
122 - Guess I'll have to find something
else\\
123 - that'll do the trick.\\
124 - Say!\\
125 - How about that horse costume that
Ricky's got?\\
126 - That's a wonderful idea, you know, we
can both...\\
127 - Now, wait just a minute, forget I
ever said it.\\
128 - If you dress as half a horse, I know
who'll be the other half\\
129 - and no, thanks.\\
130 - Oh, I know.\\
131 - I know.\\
132 - Oh, sure, these ought to do it.\\
133 - How will I look in these?\\
134 - What are you going as, a lamb chop?\\
135 - There's an old fashioned hoop skirt
that goes with this.\\
136 - We can work up a cute song and dance
number.\\
137 - I hope you're not thinking of me as
part of "we."\\
138 - Sure. We'll be a couple.\\
139 - A couple of what?\\
140 - I'll be the woman and you be the man.\\
141 - Good-bye, Lucy.\\
142 - Aw, now, Ethel,\\
143 - are you going to desert me in my hour
of need?\\
144 - Yes.\\
145 - Ethel, you who would like to be the
godmother of my child.\\
146 - Oh... but why me?\\
147 - Why can't you be the man?\\
148 - Well, that should be fairly obvious.\\
149 - Oh, all right.\\
150 - But I have a feeling I'd be better
off\\
151 - if I'd settled for the back end of
that horse.\\
152 - Pepito, haven't you got your costume
on yet?\\
153 - Yes, start my music.\\
154 - Okay, here we go, music.\\
155 - (band plays)\\
156 - Oh, SeÃ±or Ricardo.\\
157 - Hello, SeÃ±or.\\
158 - (speaking Spanish)\\
159 - (clucking)\\
160 - Muchas gracias, muchas gracias.\\
161 - (sighing)\\
162 - (laughing)\\
163 - Oh, no!\\
164 - Thank you, SeÃ±or Ricardo.\\
165 - Muy bien, amigo, muy bien.\\
166 - Oh...\\
167 - My impression of a baby crying.\\
168 - (crying)\\
169 - (crying stops)\\
170 - (crying resumes and intensifies)\\
171 - (laughing)\\
172 - (screaming)\\
173 - (gasping sobs)\\
174 - Ah.\\
175 - (crying stops)\\
176 - Muchas gracias.\\
177 - Bravo, Pepe!\\
178 - (laughing)\\
179 - Ah, SeÃ±or Ricky...\\
180 - Mira, mira, mira.\\
181 - The world's eh-smallest bicycle.\\
182 - Oh.\\
183 - (muttering softly)\\
184 - Excuse me, make myself comfortable.\\
185 - Oh-ay.\\
186 - (trombone playing low note)\\
187 - SeÃ±or Trombonista.\\
188 - Oh.\\
189 - (quick drum rolls)\\
190 - Hup, hup.\\
191 - (band plays fanfare)\\
192 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
193 - Listen, you know what I'd like you to
do?\\
194 - Si?\\
195 - That imitation of Clyde Beatty,\\
196 - you know, the lion tamer?\\
197 - With the, with the lamp chimney?\\
198 - Yeah, will you do that?\\
199 - Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.\\
200 - All right. I'll help you.\\
201 - Oh, my portable dressing room.\\
202 - (laughing)\\
203 - Oh...\\
204 - What a character.\\
205 - Gracias, gracias.\\
206 - All right.\\
207 - (clears throat)\\
208 - Open the gate.\\
209 - (imitates creaking gate)\\
210 - (whistles)
Hey, hup!\\
211 - (calling lion)\\
212 - (imitating lion's roar)\\
213 - (growling and roaring as he cracks
whip)\\
214 - Listen, you know,\\
215 - that is so realistic, you know, the
way that you do that.\\
216 - Why don't you get yourself a couple
of lions\\
217 - and be a real lion tamer?\\
218 - Let's see what else...\\
219 - Hey, Ricky.\\
220 - Yeah?\\
221 - There's an act out there waiting for
an audition.\\
222 - What act?\\
223 - McGillicuddy and Mertz.\\
224 - I didn't ask for any Mack or
McGillicuddy--\\
225 - McGillicuddy and Mertz?\\
226 - Oh, give them the music, will you?\\
227 - I won't miss this for all the money
in the world.\\
228 - This I got to see.\\
229 - Okay, girls.\\
230 - (orchestra plays introduction)\\
231 - By the light\\
232 - Not the dark, but the light\\
233 - Of the silvery moon\\
234 - Not the sun, but the moon\\
235 - I want to spoon\\
236 - Hug and kiss, 'neath the moon\\
237 - To my honey I'll croon love's tune\\
238 - What a tune\\
239 - Honeymoon\\
240 - Funny, sunny honeymoon\\
241 - Keep a-shining in June\\
242 - Not July, but in June\\
243 - Your silvery beams\\
244 - Will bring love's dreams, we'll be
cuddling soon\\
245 - Smooch, peck, neck, spoon\\
246 - By the light of the moon\\
247 - (out of tune): The silvery moon.\\
248 - Dance, Maestro.\\
249 - (piano introduction)\\
250 - Your silvery beams will bring love's
dreams\\
251 - We'll be cuddling soon\\
252 - 'Neath the silvery moon\\
253 - The silvery moon.\\
254 - Hi, Lucy.\\
255 - What do you want?\\
256 - Oh, for goodness' sake, you're still
mad.\\
257 - I am not mad!\\
258 - Well, then you got a new way of
acting happy.\\
259 - Well, how do you expect me to act\\
260 - when my own husband won't let me be
in his show?\\
261 - Oh, now, Lucy, it's his show.\\
262 - He's got a right to hire whoever he
wants.\\
263 - Yeah, what a flimsy excuse he gave
us.\\
264 - You mean telling us we stank?\\
265 - Now, you know he didn't mean that.\\
266 - He just said it because I'm expecting
a baby\\
267 - and he doesn't want me to be in the
show.\\
268 - Makes me so mad.\\
269 - Well, if it'll make you feel any
better,\\
270 - he couldn't find a place for Fred and
me either.\\
271 - Some showman he is.\\
272 - Hi, Ethel.\\
273 - Hi.\\
274 - Hiya, honey.\\
275 - (hissing)\\
276 - Huh?\\
277 - (hissing)\\
278 - Boo!\\
279 - Oh, Lucy, are you still mad at me\\
280 - on account of this afternoon?\\
281 - I'm not talking to you.\\
282 - Well, look, I'm awfully sorry\\
283 - if I could not find a place for you
in the show.\\
284 - But there is no place for a gay '90s
striptease.\\
285 - Very funny.\\
286 - (mocking laughter)\\
287 - Oh, you're a sorehead.\\
288 - Oh, now, Ricky, it's her condition.\\
289 - It is not my condition!\\
290 - I was a sorehead long before I ever
thought about...\\
291 - That's not what I meant.\\
292 - (Ricky laughing)\\
293 - Hi, Rick.\\
294 - Oh, hiya, Fred.
Listen, Fred, uh,\\
295 - I might find a place for you in the
barbershop quartet.\\
296 - FRED: Oh, good. Nobody sings
barbershop\\
297 - any better than I do.\\
298 - Oh, good night, ladies, good night,
ladies\\
299 - Good night, ladies\\
300 - We're going to leave you now\\
301 - Merrily we roll along, roll along,
roll along\\
302 - Merrily we roll along\\
303 - O'er the deep blue sea.\\
304 - Hey, that sounds pretty good!\\
305 - It's too bad you're not a man, Ethel.\\
306 - Oh, I can wear a wig and a handlebar
mustache.\\
307 - I dressed up like a man this
afternoon.\\
308 - You just heard her sing that harmony.\\
309 - Oh, come on, Ricky.
Say yes.\\
310 - RICKY: Well, we might be able to work
it out.\\
311 - What do you think of this idea?\\
312 - I thought that the three of us could
be barbers\\
313 - and then the fourth guy could be the
customer in the chair.\\
314 - ETHEL: Hey, that's cute.\\
315 - FRED: Yeah, that's a great idea.\\
316 - It'll be the first time I ever heard\\
317 - a Cuban sing barbershop.\\
318 - Well... yeah.\\
319 - A Cuban singing barbershop.\\
320 - That wouldn't sound so right, would
it?\\
321 - I'll tell you what I'll do--\\
322 - I'll sing it with an Irish accent.\\
323 - Oh, this I got to hear.\\
324 - Now, wait a minute.\\
325 - I'll practice, you'll be surprised.\\
326 - That's for sure.\\
327 - Oh...!\\
328 - ETHEL: Who's going to play the fourth
guy, Ricky?\\
329 - Good night, ladies\\
330 - Good night, ladies...\\
331 - Good night.\\
332 - Now, Ricky...\\
333 - Now, honey, please.\\
334 - Now, look, it would just be perfect.\\
335 - I can be the fourth guy in the chair
with a sheet over me.\\
336 - You seem to overlook one little minor
detail.\\
337 - You can't sing.\\
338 - I sang this afternoon.\\
339 - Look, honey, we're singing "Sweet
Adeline."\\
340 - We're singing harmony, everybody
sings something different.\\
341 - Well, then, that's just perfect.\\
342 - If everybody's singing something
different,\\
343 - it won't matter what note I hit.\\
344 - It doesn't work quite that way.\\
345 - Besides, I practically offered the
job to George Watson.\\
346 - Oh, George Watson.\\
347 - You haven't even given me a chance.\\
348 - Now, Ricky, couldn't Lucy just sing
the first part?\\
349 - You know, Sweet Adeline\\
350 - And then we could come in on the
second part.\\
351 - Of course. Just give me a chance.\\
352 - Yeah. Give her a chance.\\
353 - Come on.
Hit the notes for us.\\
354 - Okay.\\
355 - (playing melody)\\
356 - That's me.\\
357 - (singing)\\
358 - (sings harmony)\\
359 - (sings harmony)\\
360 - Lucy?\\
361 - (singing loudly off-key)\\
362 - (searching for right note)\\
363 - (hitting right note)\\
364 - (cheering)\\
365 - Bravo, bravo!
She made it!\\
366 - All right, all right, you start all
by yourself now.\\
367 - Give her the chord.\\
368 - (out of tune): Sweet Adeline.\\
369 - Well, it's a little difficult to
start all by yourself\\
370 - just out of nowhere.\\
371 - All right, we'll try it the other
way.\\
372 - LUCY: What other way?\\
373 - We'll sing the first phrase\\
374 - and you come in with the repeats.\\
375 - LUCY: Repeats?\\
376 - Yeah. We'll sing, "Sweet Adeline,"\\
377 - and you sing, "Sweet Adeline, my
Adeline."\\
378 - "My Adeline."\\
379 - "Sweet Adeline, sweet Adeline, my
Adeline," okay.\\
380 - All right. Now, you better stand\\
381 - away from us so you won't be thrown
off\\
382 - by anybody singing harmony in your
ear.\\
383 - All right? Go.\\
384 - All right, go ahead.\\
385 - Hit it.\\
386 - (perfect harmony ): Sweet Adeline\\
387 - (tinnily): Sweet Adeline\\
388 - Well, I guess I'm standing a little
close, it threw me off.\\
389 - Try it again.\\
390 - My Adeline\\
391 - (out of tune): My Adeline\\
392 - At night, dear heart\\
393 - (out of tune): At night, dear heart\\
394 - For you I pine\\
395 - For you I pine\\
396 - In all my dreams\\
397 - In all my dreams\\
398 - In all my dreams\\
399 - In all my dreams?\\
400 - George Watson, huh?\\
401 - And now, ladies and gentlemen,\\
402 - for the finale of our show,\\
403 - something that a gay '90s revue
cannot be without:\\
404 - A barbershop quartet.\\
405 - So, here it is,\\
406 - a quartet composed of Mertz,\\
407 - Mertz,\\
408 - Watson\\
409 - and Ricardo,\\
410 - with their version of "Sweet
Adeline."\\
411 - (piano introduction)\\
412 - In the evening when I sit alone
a-dreaming\\
413 - Of days gone by, love\\
414 - (clumsy Irish accent)
To me so dear...\\
415 - There's a picture that in fancy oft'
appearing\\
416 - Brings back the time, love\\
417 - When you were near...\\
418 - It is then I wonder where you are, me
darling\\
419 - And if your heart to me is still the
same\\
420 - For the sighing wind and nightingale
a-singing\\
421 - Are breathing only\\
422 - Your own sweet name\\
423 - ETHEL AND FRED: Your own sweet name\\
424 - ALL: Sweet Adeline\\
425 - (off-key): Sweet Ad--\\
426 - My Adeline\\
427 - My Ad--\\
428 - At night, dear heart\\
429 - At--\\
430 - For you I pine\\
431 - Pi--\\
432 - In all my dreams\\
433 - In all--\\
434 - Your fair face beams\\
435 - You're the flower\\
436 - Of my heart...\\
437 - Sweet Adeline...\\
438 - ALL: Sweet Adeline.\\
439 - Lucy and Desi will be back in a
moment.\\
440 - (chimes)\\
441 - (all screaming and laughing)\\
442 - Fred! Merry Christmas!\\
443 - Lucy!\\
444 - We're all Santa Clauses!\\
445 - Yeah!\\
446 - How about that?\\
447 - Let's put our presents under the
tree.\\
448 - Okay, okay. Here we go. All right.\\
449 - Whoo!\\
450 - Hey, Santa, you put on\\
451 - a little weight, didn't you?\\
452 - Ha-ha! How about you?\\
453 - Yeah!\\
454 - How about you, Ethel?\\
455 - Fred, where'd you ever buy such a big
pillow?\\
456 - Huh? Why don't you answer me?\\
457 - I'm not wearing a pillow.\\
458 - (Ricardos laugh)\\
459 - Come on, let's open all our presents.\\
460 - All right.\\
461 - Okay!\\
462 - Oh, no, no!
Let's sing first?\\

melody.\\
468 - It's called "Cascabeles."\\
469 - FRED: Let's hear it!\\
470 - Go ahead! Sing it!\\
471 - All right.
Cascabeles, cascabeles\\
472 - Cantan todo el dÃ­a\\
473 - Cascabeles, cascabeles\\
474 - Traen la alegria...\\
475 - Hey, that's "Jingle Bells."\\
476 - "Jingle Bells"?\\
477 - Sure!\\
478 - How about that?\\
479 - You Americans steal all our good
songs.\\
480 - Ha-ha! Hey, let's all sing it, huh,
Santa Clauses?\\
481 - ALL: All right.\\

\subsection {Episode 13: Lucy Hires an English Tutor}
1 - (I Love Lucy theme music plays)\\
2 - Oh, honey, where have you been?\\
3 - What took you so long?\\
4 - What do you mean, what took me so
long?\\
5 - I had to go all over town.\\
6 - There's only one store in New York
City\\
7 - that makes a papaya juice milkshake.\\
8 - Oh, thank you.\\
9 - Mmm...\\
10 - Oh...\\
11 - Did you get the dill pickle?\\
12 - Lucy, are you sure that you want
to...?\\
13 - That's right.\\
14 - Mmm...\\
15 - Ricky?\\
16 - Yes, dear.\\
17 - Honey, I never asked you this before,\\
18 - but what do you hope the baby's going
to be,\\
19 - a boy or a girl?\\
20 - You're going to be disappointed if it
isn't a boy, aren't you?\\
21 - Oh, no, honey, don't be silly.\\
22 - You will, too.\\
23 - Every man wants a little boy\\
24 - so he can see himself running around.\\
25 - Well, I don't particularly.\\
26 - If it's a boy, I'll be happy,\\
27 - and if it's a girl I'll be happy,
too.\\
28 - I really don't care.\\
29 - Well, that's good.\\
30 - How do you feel about it, honey?\\
31 - I guess every woman wants a little
girl\\
32 - so she can dress her up fancy and
fuss over her\\
33 - and teach her how to catch a man.\\
34 - Well, maybe most women do, but I feel
just the way you do, Ricky.\\
35 - I don't care, boy or girl, doesn't
make any difference.\\
36 - Oh, that's good.\\
37 - Here, honey.\\
38 - Thank you.\\
39 - Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.\\
40 - Oh, honey, what's in the package?\\
41 - Oh, honey, nothing, nothing.\\
42 - Well, it's spoiled now.\\
43 - I might just as well open it.\\
44 - But I don't want you...\\
45 - So you have no preference, huh?\\
46 - Well, that doesn't mean anything.\\
47 - Lots of little girls play football,
too, you know.\\
48 - What are you going to name her, Rocky
Ricardo?\\
49 - Come on, now.\\
50 - Let's see what other feminine frills\\
51 - we have here.\\
52 - Havana U., 1974.\\
53 - So it doesn't make any difference to
you,\\
54 - boy or girl, no preference, doesn't
matter.\\
55 - All right, all right, so I'd rather
have a boy.\\
56 - Is that so terrible?\\
57 - Now, give me the stuff, come on.\\
58 - Oh, honey, now, don't get mad.\\
59 - No, come on, you're making fun of me.
Aw, come on.\\
60 - Sit down, honey.\\
61 - Come on, sit down, baby, come on,
now.\\
62 - Well...\\
63 - If you dress my son in this,\\
64 - he'll need those boxing gloves.\\
65 - Well, I guess it's true.\\
66 - Women want girls and men want boys.\\
67 - Yeah, I guess you're right.\\
68 - Havana U.?\\
69 - What?\\
70 - You mean you want our child to go to
Havana University?\\
71 - Certainly.\\
72 - Havana U., my old alma mater.\\
73 - Oh, wouldn't that be wonderful?\\
74 - Just think of it.\\
75 - Our son.\\
76 - Or daughter.\\
77 - Walking the very same campus\\
78 - where I used to walk.\\
79 - And one day, after Havana wins the
big game\\
80 - and holds the jai alai pennant,\\
81 - we'll stand together and sing:\\
82 - Arriba, arriba por Havana U.\\
83 - No hay nadie en el mundo que sea como
tu\\
84 - Rah, rah, viva, rah, rah, rah\\
85 - Havana, Havana U., ole!\\
86 - Yeah, well, that's fine, dear, from
your point of you,\\
87 - but... gee, I don't know, Havana?\\
88 - What's the matter with Havana?\\
89 - Well, nothing,\\
90 - but we have a couple little red
schoolhouses\\
91 - in this country, too, you know.\\
92 - Well, honey, let's not worry about
it.\\
93 - The main thing is\\
94 - that our child will go to college.
Yeah.\\
95 - You know, I've been giving this a lot
of thought, Ricky.\\
96 - It's a big responsibility having a
baby and bringing up a child.\\
97 - You know all the questions they ask.\\
98 - You have to give them a right answer,
too.\\
99 - Gee, I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to do it.\\
100 - Oh, honey, sure you will.\\
101 - Well, I don't know.\\
102 - You know the kind of questions
children ask.\\
103 - Suppose our child asks something
simple like,\\
104 - "Mommy, where does rain come from?"\\
105 - "Where does rain come from?\\
106 - "Well, I don't know, dear.\\
107 - Your mommy's a dumbbell."\\
108 - Oh, honey,\\
109 - you're just being ridiculous.\\
110 - I am not.\\
111 - Of course, there's always one good
answer:\\
112 - "Ask your daddy, dear.\\
113 - He can explain it better than I can."\\
114 - "Daddy, where does rain come from?"\\
115 - Well, dear, it's very simple.\\
116 - You see, the water...\\
117 - Well, first of all,\\
118 - there are the clouds, see.\\
119 - And the clo...\\
120 - The moisture in the air...\\
121 - See what I mean?\\
122 - We have to do something about this.\\
123 - Oh, honey, you're just exaggerating
the whole thing.\\
124 - I am not.\\
125 - And I'm going to start studying right
now.\\
126 - When I get through, I want my child
to think\\
127 - that its mother is a walking book of
knowledge.\\
128 - (chuckling)\\
129 - Hi, honey.\\
130 - Good evening.\\
131 - Oh, when you get started on
something,\\
132 - you really go through with it, don't
you?\\
133 - Oh, boy, am I pooped.\\
134 - Well, this is indeed distressing
news.\\
135 - To what do you attribute your
plethora of fatigue?\\
136 - The enervating activities of your
nocturnal occupation?\\
137 - What?\\
138 - I said, this is indeed distressing
news.\\
139 - To what do you attribute your
plethora of fatigue?\\
140 - I heard you the first time, but what
language is it?\\
141 - It's the language I want our child to
learn: good English.\\
142 - That's English?\\
143 - Yes.\\
144 - Funny thing-- when it's spoken
correctly,\\
145 - you don't even recognize it, do you?\\
146 - You know, I had no idea how sloppy my
speech was\\
147 - until I started reading this book.\\
148 - Oh, brother.\\
149 - No, really, it's true.\\
150 - But they have a wonderful exercise\\
151 - to correct it.\\
152 - "How do you do, Mrs. Smith?\\
153 - "How do you do, Mrs. Jones?\\
154 - "And how are all your adorable
children?\\
155 - "Quite well, thank you.\\
156 - "And how is your sister Cynthia?\\
157 - Sister Cynthia is simply
scintillating."\\
158 - Now, Lucy, you're not going to teach
our child\\
159 - to talk that way, are you?\\
160 - I certainly am.
From the time our child is born,\\
161 - it's not going to hear anything but
perfect English.\\
162 - Well, honey, it's a very nice
thought,\\
163 - but as usual you have no logical
'splanation\\
164 - for doin' it the way you're doin' it.\\
165 - What did you say?\\
166 - You heard what I said.\\
167 - "As usual, there's no logical
'splanation\\
168 - for doin' it the way you're doin'
it."\\
169 - Ricky, promise me something.\\
170 - What?\\
171 - Promise me that until our child is at
least 19 or 20 years old,\\
172 - you won't talk to it.\\
173 - What?\\
174 - What's the matter with the way I
talk?\\
175 - Well, I haven't told you this before,
dear,\\
176 - but you speak with a slight accent.\\
177 - You can understand me, can't you?\\
178 - Well, now, yes.\\
179 - I've learned to listen with an
accent.\\
180 - But when we first started going
together, it was just...\\
181 - Well, do you remember when you
proposed?
Yeah.\\
182 - Well, it was a stab in the dark
when... when I said yes.\\
183 - I wasn't sure that you'd asked me to
get married\\
184 - or go to a movie.\\
185 - Do you mean to tell me\\
186 - that I could have gotten out of this
whole deal\\
187 - by just taking you to a movie?\\
188 - Ricky Ricardo.\\
189 - Here, honey, I'll show you what I
mean.\\
190 - Now, you take this book\\
191 - and pretend that our child has come
to you and said,\\
192 - "Daddy, read me a good-night story."\\
193 - All right.\\
194 - There you are, Daddy.\\
195 - "Once upon a time in the woods live a
peasant.\\
196 - "He was a good man with a noble
heart.\\
197 - "He spent his time in the forest\\
198 - cutting down booges from the trees."\\
199 - "Cutting wood..." Wait a minute.\\
200 - Wait, wait, wait, just a minute.\\
201 - What is this "booges?"\\
202 - "Booges," right in there.\\
203 - That's "boughs."\\
204 - B-O-U-G-H is "bough?"\\
205 - Right.\\
206 - Bough.\\
207 - "He spent his time in the forest
cutting down boughs\\
208 - "from the trees.\\
209 - "Cutting wood all day made his hands
strong and row.\\
210 - One day..."\\
211 - That's "rough."\\
212 - Spelled the same way as the other:
O-U-G-H.\\
213 - That's right.\\
214 - That shows how little you know about
the English language.\\
215 - So I made a little mistake.\\
216 - "Made his hands strong and rough.\\
217 - "One day he cut wood so fast that by
3:00 in the afternoon,\\
218 - "his day's work was thruff.\\
219 - When the..."\\
220 - Hold it, Shakespeare.\\
221 - Thraugh?\\
222 - T-h-r-o-u-g-h is pronounced
"through."\\
223 - Through, that's what I always say.\\
224 - Now, stop picking on me, will you?\\
225 - You're getting me all confuse.\\
226 - "His day's work was through.\\
227 - "It started to rain on the way home,\\
228 - "and he got so wet that his nose
became red\\
229 - and he developed a hacking..."\\
230 - "coo?"\\
231 - Well, I know it can't be "cow."\\
232 - It's "cough."\\
233 - Oh, that did it.\\
234 - I had enough.\\
235 - Or should I say "enu"?\\
236 - No, enough.\\
237 - Enough.\\
238 - I don't see why you have to have such
a crazy language anyway.\\
239 - In Spanish you don't have all those
"ow," "oh," "oo,"\\
240 - "off," "oof" sounds.\\
241 - In Spanish, you got a sound, it
sounds the same all the time.\\
242 - You write it the same way, it sounds
the same way.\\
243 - No matter where you put it, it comes
out the same way.\\
244 - Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.\\
245 - I tell you what we're gonna do.\\
246 - We're gonna teach our child to speak
Spanish.\\
247 - Spanish!\\
248 - That's right.\\
249 - And what's more,\\
250 - I don't want you to talk to the kid
until he's 21 years old.\\
251 - Our child is going to learn to speak
English,\\
252 - but first we have to learn.\\
253 - We're going to hire a tutor.\\
254 - A tutor?\\
255 - That's right.\\
256 - And you and I and Fred and Ethel will
take lessons.\\
257 - Fred and Ethel?\\
258 - How did they get into the act?\\
259 - Well, they're gonna be around here a
lot,\\
260 - and I want anyone who's gonna
converse with my child\\
261 - to speak perfect English.\\
262 - Now, Lucy, that is the most
ridiculous thing I ever heard...\\
263 - Now, honey, my mind is made up...\\
264 - I had enough trouble learning how to
speak American.\\
265 - ETHEL: Hi, Lucy.\\
266 - Hi.\\
267 - Is the tutor here yet?\\
268 - No, not yet. He ought to be here any
minute.\\
269 - I'm fixing the classroom, see?\\
270 - Oh!\\
271 - Say, Lucy, aren't tutors awful
expensive?\\
272 - How did you get Ricky to agree to pay
for one?\\
273 - I didn't. I told him it wouldn't cost
him a cent.\\
274 - Huh?\\
275 - Well, you see, when Mr. Livermore
called me,\\
276 - he just happened to mention that he
would be interested...\\
277 - RICKY: Lucy!
Yeah, dear?\\
278 - Are the Mertzes here yet?
Ethel's here.\\
279 - Hi, Ethel.
Hi.\\
280 - Where's Fred?
Isn't he coming?\\
281 - Yeah, he's coming all right, but he
kicked like a steer.\\
282 - Well, is he coming?\\
283 - Look, if Fred doesn't come, I don't
want to...\\
284 - He'll be here, Ricky.\\
285 - He had on dirty overalls,\\
286 - and I made him change his clothes.\\
287 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
288 - That must be Mr. Livermore now.\\
289 - School days, school days, dear old
golden rule days\\
290 - Reading and writing and 'rithmetic
(Ricky laughing hysterically)\\
291 - Taught to the tune of a hickory stick\\
292 - You were my bashful barefoot beau\\
293 - Wrote on my slate, "I love you,
Joe"...\\
294 - Fred Mertz!\\
295 - (laughing)\\
296 - Oh, Fred, that's wonderful.\\
297 - What do you think you're doing?\\
298 - Now, you two stop.\\
299 - This is serious.\\
300 - All right, Buster Brown, go
downstairs\\
301 - and get out of that silly outfit.\\
302 - All right, all right!\\
303 - See you at recess, Rick.\\
304 - Last one to the teeter-totter's a
rotten egg.\\
305 - (laughing)\\
306 - I was your queen in calico\\
307 - You were my bashful barefoot beau\\
308 - Why-ay-ay...\\
309 - How do you do?\\
310 - How do you do?\\
311 - Are you Mister...\\
312 - I'm Mr. Livermore.\\
313 - Oh, come in, please. Please.\\
314 - I-I'm Mrs. Ricardo.\\
315 - Charmed.\\
316 - Pleased to meetcha.\\
317 - Meetcha?\\
318 - The phrase is "meet you."\\
319 - Meet you.\\
320 - Meet you.\\
321 - Meet... I'm glad to meet you.\\
322 - Meet you.\\
323 - Uh, I'd like you to meet your other
pupils.\\
324 - This is Mrs. Mertz.\\
325 - Howdja do?\\
326 - Are you, by any chance, endeavoring
to pronounce\\
327 - "How do you do?"\\
328 - Yeah-- uh, yes.\\
329 - Uh, and this is Fred Mertz.\\
330 - Howdja do?\\
331 - You see, Mrs. Mertz,\\
332 - you've transmitted your bad
enunciation\\
333 - to your son here.\\
334 - (Ricky laughs)\\
335 - Ow, you hurt me, Mommy.\\
336 - Oh, behave yourself.\\
337 - He isn't my son.\\
338 - He's my husband.\\
339 - My word.\\
340 - Either way, it presents an appalling
prospect.\\
341 - You don't understand, Mr. Livermore.\\
342 - You see, Fred is dressed like that\\
343 - because he's going back to school.\\
344 - It's his idea of a little joke.\\
345 - (laughs)\\
346 - Oh?\\
347 - Uh, this is my husband, Ricky
Ricardo.\\
348 - It is a great pleasure\\
349 - to make your acquaintance, Mr.
Ricardo.\\
350 - Hi. I just want you to know that the
only reason\\
351 - I'm only doing this is to keep her
happy\\
352 - because she's going to have a baby in
February.\\
353 - But to tell you the truth,\\
354 - this whole thing is ridiculous to me,\\
355 - and the whole routine, I don't want
any part of it.\\
356 - What did he say?\\
357 - Well, he was just trying to...\\
358 - What's the matter with you?\\
359 - Don't you understand English?\\
360 - We'd better get started immediately.\\
361 - There's more to do here than I
thought.\\
362 - Places, everybody.\\
363 - Is he making fun of me?\\
364 - No. Shh! Shush!\\
365 - LIVERMORE: Attention, class.\\
366 - Inasmuch as we are faced here with a
state of emergency,\\
367 - I will dispense with the traditional
oath of allegiance\\
368 - and good-morning song.\\
369 - To properly enunciate,\\
370 - we must practice first saying our
vowels.\\
371 - Repeat after me, please.\\
372 - A, E, I, O, U.\\
373 - A,	A,	A,	    Ah,\\
374 - E,	E,	E,	    Eh,\\
375 - I,	I,	I,	    Ee,\\
376 - O,	O,	O,	    Oh,\\
377 - U,	U,	U,	    Ooh.\\
378 - Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh.\\
379 - Mr. Ricardo, please, alone.\\
380 - Ah, eh, ee, oh, ooh.\\
381 - Mr. Ricardo, wherever did you acquire\\
382 - that odd pronunciation?\\
383 - I went to school in Cuba.\\
384 - What's your 'scuse?\\
385 - Ricky, apologize!\\
386 - Apologize!\\
387 - Okay, okay, I'm...\\
388 - No, no, just a moment.\\
389 - Did you say "okay?"\\
390 - Yeah.\\
391 - We must rid our speech of slang.\\
392 - Now, besides "okay," I want you all
to promise me\\
393 - that there are two words that you
will never use.\\
394 - One of these is "swell" and the other
one is "lousy."\\
395 - Okay, what are they?\\
396 - One of them is "swell" and the other
one is "lousy."\\
397 - Well, give us the lousy one first.\\
398 - I don't believe you quite understand.\\
399 - Don't bother to explain, Mr.
Livermore.\\
400 - Just tell us what the words are\\
401 - and we won't use them.
No.\\
402 - But don't you see? The word...\\
403 - Well, the other...\\
404 - May I have a glass of water, please?\\
405 - Okay.\\
406 - I-I mean yes.\\
407 - Would you help me, Ethel,\\
408 - get a pitcher and some glasses?
Yes.\\
409 - I would say "okay."\\
410 - That's a swell way to get off to a
lousy start.\\
411 - Mr. Ricardo, perhaps this would be a
good time\\
412 - to discuss our song.\\
413 - Our song?\\
414 - Well, at least my song.\\
415 - You see, I'm referring to the
business deal\\
416 - your wife and I made.\\
417 - Don't you understand?\\
418 - In lieu of the remuneration for my
tutelage,\\
419 - I am to be permitted to introduce my
talents\\
420 - into your nocturnal bistro.\\
421 - Hey, hey, I think I got it, Rick.\\
422 - Instead of you paying him, this guy's
gonna sing\\
423 - in your nightclub.
Yes.\\
424 - You want to sing at the Tropicana?\\
425 - Thank you, I'd love to.\\
426 - I tippy-tippy-toe through my garden\\
427 - Where all the pretty flowers dwell\\
428 - Wait a minute...
There's a rare perfume in my
garden...\\
429 - Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.\\
430 - Hold it. Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.\\
431 - I don't know what...
Ricky, what's the matter?\\
432 - What's the matter?
What's going on, dear?\\
433 - Well, I was singing my little ditty\\
434 - for your husband...
You mean to tell me\\
435 - that you actually promised this
character\\
436 - that he was going to sing at the
club?\\
437 - Yes, isn't it wonderful?\\
438 - And we're going to get six months'
English lessons free.\\
439 - I don't care we're gonna get English
lessons free\\
440 - for the rest of our lives.\\
441 - He's not gonna sing in my club.\\
442 - Well!\\
443 - But, Ricky, that isn't fair.\\
444 - You haven't even heard the song.\\
445 - I heard the song.\\
446 - "Tippy-tippy-toe." Ay-yi-yi-yi.\\
447 - Well, I think you owe Mr. Livermore
the courtesy\\
448 - of at least hearing it through once.\\
449 - Now, after all, it's going to sound a
lot better\\
450 - down at the club, with the lights on\\
451 - and all of us singing with him and
everything...\\
452 - BOTH: All of us singing?!\\
453 - What do you mean, all of us singing?\\
454 - Now, just a minute.\\
455 - He's worked up a very cute little
act,\\
456 - he's got it all figured out,\\
457 - and I think the least we could do is
listen\\
458 - and I insist that we try it now.\\
459 - Thank you.\\
460 - Now, this is the way I start.\\
461 - Mr. Mertz, please.\\
462 - I stand here,\\
463 - Mr. and Mrs. Ricardo there, Mr. and
Mrs. Mertz there.\\
464 - (clears throat)\\
465 - And I sing the verse first.\\
466 - (clears throat)\\
467 - I tippy-tippy-toe through my garden\\
468 - Where all the pretty flowers dwell\\
469 - There's a rare perfume in my garden\\
470 - And I just love to stand there and
smell\\
471 - And as...\\
472 - Now you come back here.\\
473 - You come right back here.\\
474 - You haven't heard the best part yet.\\
475 - That's obvious, yeah.\\
476 - Now come on back here, right where
you were, all of you.\\
477 - Go ahead, Mr. Livermore.\\
478 - Thank you.\\
479 - And as I tippy-tippy-toe along\\
480 - All the pretty flowers seem to sing
this song.\\
481 - Now, here's where you come in.\\
482 - Here's one for each.\\
483 - Ladies first, of course.\\
484 - Now, you sing when I point to you.\\
485 - Now I'll sing what I just sang again.\\
486 - (clears throat)\\
487 - And as I tippy-tippy-toe along\\
488 - All the pretty flowers seem to sing
this song\\
489 - Darry-down pip-pip\\
490 - Dilly-dilly day\\
491 - Hey, nonny-nonny\\
492 - Rippity-pippity ay\\
493 - Now comes the cute part.\\
494 - You begin first this time, Mr. Mertz.\\
495 - Darry-down ding-dong\\
496 - Dilly-dilly doo\\
497 - Hey, nonny-nonny\\
498 - Rippity-pippity poo\\
499 - That's all, brother, I had it.\\
500 - Ricky, Ricky...
You can...\\
501 - ETHEL: Oh, Lucy...\\
502 - (all talking at once)\\
503 - Sit down, won't you?\\
504 - Hey, Rick.\\
505 - Yeah, hi, Fred.\\
506 - Ethel tells me\\
507 - you're going through with this silly
thing.\\
508 - Yeah, I told Lucy that I was going to
last night.\\
509 - See? Where is Lucy?\\
510 - She's in the bedroom.\\
511 - What's the matter with you?\\
512 - I believe you've finally cracked your
Cuban crock.\\
513 - Look, Fred, will you trust me, huh?\\
514 - I got a plan, I got it all figured
out,\\
515 - and I think it'll work perfect.\\
516 - I made a deal with Mr. Livermore.\\
517 - Yes, but I'm afraid I've sullied my
principles\\
518 - by accepting your scheme, Mr.
Ricardo.\\
519 - Now, remember, you guaranteed to get
me auditions\\
520 - with every record company in town.\\
521 - Look, you just hold your end of the
bargain\\
522 - and I'll take care of mine.
Don't you worry.\\
523 - Will you please tell me what's going
on?\\
524 - Relax, will you?
You'll see.\\
525 - Lucy!\\
526 - LUCY: Yes, dear Coming.\\
527 - Oh, hello, Mr. Livermore.\\
528 - Hi, Fred.
Hi, Lucy.\\
529 - What's the matter, dear?
Is something wrong?\\
530 - I didn't expect you home so soon.\\
531 - Oh, no, no, honey, nothing is wrong.\\
532 - Everything is fine.
The orchestrations are wonderful.\\
533 - We just thought that we'd come home\\
534 - and get a good, uninterrupted singing
rehearsal.\\
535 - Oh, well, that's nice.\\
536 - You know something, Lucy?
You were right.\\
537 - I can't 'splain it, but this guy
grows on you.\\
538 - Aw...\\
539 - Well, I knew you'd like him.\\
540 - Yeah, no kiddin'.\\
541 - He dun't know what a real nice guy he
is.\\
542 - He dun't either.\\
543 - What did you say?\\
544 - I said he dun't either.\\
545 - I can't 'splain it, but...\\
546 - He's a swell guy.\\
547 - Oh, no.\\
548 - Ah, listen, you should hear him get
going\\
549 - when he gets ahold of a good song.\\
550 - He really goes-- he's good, this guy.\\
551 - Oh, Percy, come on, go ahead.\\
552 - LIVERMORE: Well...\\
553 - Bum...\\
554 - Babaloo\\
555 - Bum...\\
556 - Babaloo\\
557 - RICKY: Bum...\\
558 - Babaloo ay yay...\\
559 - That a boy! Give it to them, Percy.\\
560 - Yay...\\
561 - Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.\\
562 - It won't work. It won't work.\\
563 - What won't work?\\
564 - It was a battle of the accents,\\
565 - and Mr. Livermore lost.\\
566 - It won't work.
Just forget it.\\
567 - But honey, I got the orchestratings\\
568 - and everything's fine...\\

2 - Hi, Fred.\\
3 - Listen, did you call Jim and Morey?\\
4 - Well, as soon as they get there,
bring them up, huh?\\
5 - Yeah, I'll have the television
getting warm\\
6 - and the beer getting cold.\\
7 - Yeah, we'll watch the game from up
here.\\
8 - What do you mean we'll upset Lucy?\\
9 - Of course not.\\
10 - Listen, Fred, there is nothing wrong
with Lucy.\\
11 - She's just having a baby.\\
12 - Why does everybody treat her\\
13 - like she's falling apart or
something?\\
14 - Okay, I'll see you\\
15 - in a few minutes. Bye.\\
16 - (yells)\\
17 - Honey!\\
18 - Why did you take that chair away?\\
19 - Oh, I'm sorry, honey.\\
20 - I didn't know that was your chair.\\
21 - What's the big idea?
I want to watch the ball game.\\
22 - Oh, honey, you can't watch television
up here today.\\
23 - What do you mean I can't?\\
24 - Fred is coming up with a couple of
the guys.\\
25 - Well, I'm sorry.
The girls are coming over.\\
26 - They're giving me a baby shower.\\
27 - Oh, now, honey.\\
28 - Now, dear, think of the baby.\\
29 - Think of all the nice things she'll
get.\\
30 - Well, think of me.\\
31 - I finally get an afternoon off,\\
32 - and I can't even sit in my own home\\
33 - and watch my own television set.\\
34 - Now, I am thinking of you.\\
35 - If it wasn't for the baby shower,\\
36 - you'd have to pay for all that loot
I'm going to get.\\
37 - Well, it might be worth it.\\
38 - Ricky Ricardo, you're jealous of the
baby.\\
39 - Oh, now, honey, don't be silly.\\
40 - Well, then you go to Fred's and look
at the game.\\
41 - Isn't it nice the girls are giving me
a surprise shower?\\
42 - Well, if it's a surprise, how do you
know about it?\\
43 - Well, how do you think?\\
44 - Every girl in the club called up and
told me.\\
45 - Every girl in the club called up and
told you\\
46 - it was going to be a surprise?\\
47 - Yeah, yeah.\\
48 - They knew I'd hate it if they came
over here to surprise me\\
49 - and the house was a mess, and I had
my hair up in curlers.\\
50 - I want them to surprise me\\
51 - but I don't want them to surprise me.\\
52 - Yeah, uh-huh.\\
53 - (sighs)\\
54 - What are you doing?\\
55 - Oh... (laughing)\\
56 - Trying to pick up this dead petunia
and I got stuck.\\
57 - Help me, will you?\\
58 - Oh, honey, come on.\\
59 - Up you go.\\
60 - (both laughing)\\
61 - My center of gravity has shifted a
little.\\
62 - (both laughing)\\
63 - Well, honey, after six months, you
should've learned\\
64 - there are a few things that you can't
do.\\
65 - Yeah, that's right.\\
66 - Here, I'll take them out for you,
honey.\\
67 - Oh, thank you.\\
68 - You sit down and rest; go on.\\
69 - No, honey, I'm all right.\\
70 - Come on, I want you to sit down and
rest; sit down.\\
71 - Uh, well, all right, but in that
chair, dear.\\
72 - Well, honey, that's the most
comfortable chair\\
73 - in the whole house.\\
74 - Yeah, I know it's comfortable,\\
75 - but once I get into it, I can't get
out of it.\\
76 - Well, honey, I'm here to help you.\\
77 - Sit down, be comfortable.\\
78 - Well...\\
79 - Go ahead. Come on.\\
80 - All right.\\
81 - There you are.\\
82 - Oh, honey, would you take out\\
83 - that wastepaper basket too?\\
84 - Sure.\\
85 - Whew...\\
86 - There's a few bottles under the sink\\
87 - that ought to go out, too, dear.\\
88 - (phone ringing)\\
89 - (ringing continues)\\
90 - Hello?\\
91 - No, no, thank you.\\
92 - We already subscribe to all the
magazines we can use.\\
93 - Thank you.\\
94 - Hey, what are you doing up?\\
95 - I thought you couldn't get up out of
that chair.\\
96 - Oh, well, I was wrong, dear.\\
97 - It was a cinch.\\
98 - You better run along now.\\
99 - The girls will be here any minute.\\
100 - Okay.\\
101 - Say, uh, what am I supposed to do for
lunch?\\
102 - Oh, honey,\\
103 - I just haven't got time to fix lunch
for you.\\
104 - Gee, I forgot all about you.\\
105 - Yeah, that's been happening a lot
lately.\\
106 - Aw, gosh, honey, I'm s...\\
107 - Oh, that's all right, that's all
right.\\
108 - I guess I can get Fred to rustle up
something.\\
109 - Well, that would be a lot...\\
110 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
111 - That must be the girls.
Honey, go out the back way.\\
112 - Go on, go out that way.\\
113 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
114 - Uh... come on in, the door is open.\\
115 - ALL: Surprise! Surprise!\\
116 - Surprise!
Surprise!\\
117 - Oh!\\
118 - Oh, my gosh!\\
119 - Oh, I never thought...\\
120 - A surprise for me?\\
121 - Oh, that's wonderful!\\
122 - (laughing)\\
123 - Did you ever see\\
124 - anything like that in your life?\\
125 - Oh, I love 'em!
Aren't they adorable?\\
126 - They're so little!\\
127 - Look at this that goes with it.\\
128 - Isn't that cute!\\
129 - Did you notice these little shirts,
Lucy?\\
130 - Weren't the girls generous, Ethel?\\
131 - Oh, I'll say they were.\\
132 - Oh, hi, Ricky.\\
133 - Look at all the wonderful things the
baby and I got.\\
134 - Oh, gee, that's swell.\\
135 - Aren't they adorable?\\
136 - (chuckling): Oh, yeah...\\
137 - Listen, honey, is dinner ready?\\
138 - Oh, honey, I've been so busy.\\
139 - I forgot.\\
140 - Well, honey, you know what time I
have to get to work.\\
141 - Oh, yeah, well, I'll fix something
right away.\\
142 - Look at this.
Isn't that cute?\\
143 - That's cute.\\
144 - Look at this, honey.
Can't you just...?\\
145 - Ooh, isn't that darling?\\
146 - I'll be right back.\\
147 - Hey, Rick, did you see today's paper?\\
148 - No.\\
149 - You made Winchell's column.\\
150 - I did?
Yeah!\\
151 - Ricky, Winchell!
How wonderful!\\
152 - No kidding!\\
153 - Yeah, there's a whole item here about
you.\\
154 - Oh, imagine me in Winchell's column.\\
155 - Yeah.
There it is.\\
156 - "Carrot-topped Lucy Ricardo, formerly
Lucy McGillicuddy\\
157 - "and currently one of show business's
most beautiful wives\\
158 - is 'infanticipating.'"\\
159 - Oh! Isn't that wonderful?\\
160 - How about that?\\
161 - It's a nice article about me, yeah.\\
162 - You're in there.\\
163 - You haven't finished it.
Here, read that.\\
164 - Oh. Oh.\\
165 - Her husband is the bandleader.\\
166 - Oh, that's wonderful, dear.\\
167 - Let me see.
Look, Ethel.\\
168 - Uh... "Lucy Ricardo...\\
169 - (mumbling)\\
170 - "beautiful..."\\
171 - "infanticipating."\\
172 - Aw! We'll have to cut that out and
save it.\\
173 - It's the first time\\
174 - the baby's been mentioned in print.\\
175 - Hey, you ought to start a scrapbook.\\
176 - How 'bout dinner, eh?\\
177 - That's a wonderful idea!
A baby scrapbook.\\
178 - How 'bout dinner?\\
179 - I would love that.\\
180 - I love keeping scrapbooks.\\
181 - It'll have to be a great big one\\
182 - "Would you like dinner, Ricky?\\
183 - ...if it's already made Winchell's
column.\\
184 - "Yeah, I'd love some dinner."\\
185 - "What would you like?"\\
186 - "I would like a nice, big, thick
steak; juicy."\\
187 - "Would you like some potatoes with
it?"\\
188 - "Yes, please, and put plenty of
butter in the potato."\\
189 - "How about some onions, Ricky?"\\
190 - "Oh! I would like to have some
onions."\\
191 - All right, all right, all right, I'll
fix you something to eat.\\
192 - Would a nice piece of rare roast beef
make you feel better?\\
193 - And how.\\
194 - Okay, coming right up.\\
195 - Okay.\\
196 - Aw, gee, it was a wonderful shower.\\
197 - Too bad you fellows couldn't be here.\\
198 - Well, Ethel, I'd have come,\\
199 - (falsetto:)
but I didn't have a thing to wear.\\
200 - Oh, you, come on downstairs and I'll
fix your supper.\\
201 - Bye, Ricky.\\
202 - Good-bye.\\
203 - (laughs)\\
204 - Would this be rare enough?\\
205 - Oh, Lucy.\\
206 - Well, I bought it.\\
207 - I just forgot to cook it, that's all.\\
208 - Don't you have anything else?\\
209 - Uh, yeah, how would you like a nice,
thick,\\
210 - juicy, delicious...
fried egg sandwich.\\
211 - No?\\
212 - Well, the surprise shower threw me
off schedule.\\
213 - I had a lot of things to do today,
Ricky.\\
214 - You should see the list of things I
had.\\
215 - Here, look, look at this.\\
216 - "Buy roast beef."\\
217 - Well, congratulations.\\
218 - Thank you.\\
219 - "Pick up Ricky's laundry."\\
220 - Ew...\\
221 - Now, you're not going to tell me\\
222 - that I don't have any clean shirts.\\
223 - I'm not?\\
224 - Well, couldn't you stop by the
laundry\\
225 - on your way to the club?\\
226 - "Pick up Ricky's tux at cleaners."\\
227 - Well, it's only a couple more blocks\\
228 - to the cleaners.\\
229 - I better get going.\\
230 - I got a lot of things to do.\\
231 - Uh, you don't mind if I borrow your
list, do you?\\
232 - No.\\
233 - Thanks.\\
234 - Well, honey, you have to eat.\\
235 - Let me fix you something.\\
236 - Oh, don't worry about me.
I'll get by.\\
237 - I'll-I'll-I'll eat.\\
238 - I'll get something, somehow,
somewhere.\\
239 - It's the doctor, dear.\\
240 - Good morning, Ricky.\\
241 - Hiya, Doc.\\
242 - Now, what seems to be the trouble?\\
243 - You just tell me all about it.\\
244 - Uh, well, he was very nauseated this
morning.\\
245 - Oh?
And, uh...\\
246 - Nauseated?
Yes, and he has dizzy spells\\
247 - and he has pains in his stomach.\\
248 - Pains in his stomach.\\
249 - Uh-huh.
Hmm.\\
250 - Every few minutes.\\
251 - It must be something I ate last
night.\\
252 - I see.\\
253 - Yeah, well, I suppose it's my fault.\\
254 - I should've gotten you dinner, dear,\\
255 - instead of having that silly shower.\\
256 - Hmm...
Yeah.\\
257 - Hmm, no temperature.\\
258 - Mrs. Ricardo, do you mind\\
259 - if I talk to your husband alone for a
moment?\\
260 - Oh, not at all.\\
261 - Is it, is it serious, Doctor?\\
262 - Is it fatal?\\
263 - Come on, tell me.\\
264 - I can take it.
Go ahead.\\
265 - Tell me, Ricky, have you been feeling
neglected lately,\\
266 - since your wife is going to have a
baby?\\
267 - Neglected?!\\
268 - No. Why?\\
269 - Well...\\
270 - Think of all your symptoms.\\
271 - You say you have morning sickness,
right?\\
272 - Yeah.\\
273 - Pains in the stomach?\\
274 - Yeah.
Dizziness?\\
275 - Yeah.\\
276 - Don't you see, Ricky?\\
277 - They're exactly like the symptoms\\
278 - your wife has been having lately.\\
279 - Oh, now, come on, what are you going
to tell me,\\
280 - that I'm going to have a baby?\\
281 - (chuckles)\\
282 - No, I can definitely assure you\\
283 - you are not going to have a baby.\\
284 - No kidding.\\
285 - Now, for this I got to pay you for a
house call?\\
286 - Now, come on, stop joking, will you?\\
287 - I'm not neglected, I'm sick.\\
288 - I'm surprised you don't feel
neglected.\\
289 - Why, your wife even said\\
290 - she couldn't fix dinner for you last
night\\
291 - because of the baby shower.\\
292 - So? That didn't bother me.\\
293 - Listen, if I wanted to get upset,\\
294 - I got a hundred things to get upset
about.\\
295 - She didn't pick up my laundry.\\
296 - My suits weren't cleaned.\\
297 - I come home on an afternoon off,\\
298 - I can't even sit and watch the ball
game.\\
299 - Now, what are you trying to say,\\
300 - that I'm sick because I'm feeling
sorry for myself?\\
301 - Well, not...\\
302 - Aw, come on, will you?\\
303 - That's the craziest thing\\
304 - I ever heard of in my whole life.\\
305 - I'm sick because I ate something.\\
306 - It didn't land in the right place.\\
307 - It gave me a pain.
It made me dizzy.\\
308 - That's what made me sick.\\
309 - That's the craziest double-talk I
ever heard in my life.\\
310 - Well, on second thought,\\
311 - maybe I better have another look at
you.\\
312 - Oh...\\
313 - Ah...\\
314 - Yes, you definitely have ptomaine.\\
315 - Well, that's more like it.\\
316 - Hi, Lucy.\\
317 - Oh, hi.\\
318 - Did you find out\\
319 - what's the matter with Ricky yet?\\
320 - No, the doctor's still in there.\\
321 - Oh, Doctor, what's the matter with
him?\\
322 - Oh, it's nothing serious.\\
323 - You know, Mrs. Ricardo,\\
324 - sometimes, when a wife is expecting,\\
325 - the, uh, husband develops the same
symptoms.\\
326 - Really?
Well, that seems strange.\\
327 - Oh, no, no.\\
328 - It's not unusual.\\
329 - At a time like this, when everybody's
interest\\
330 - centers around the expected child,\\
331 - the husband feels left out,
neglected.\\
332 - Oh, I don't think Ricky feels
neglected.\\
333 - Still, there was that baby shower
yesterday.\\
334 - Yeah, and you forgot to fix dinner
for him.\\
335 - Yeah, and I forgot to pick up his
cleaning and his laundry\\
336 - and he did act kind of funny about
that, didn't he?\\
337 - Exactly as I thought.
You know,\\
338 - if there was some way that you could
figure out\\
339 - to make your husband the center of
attention,\\
340 - I'm sure your troubles would be over.\\
341 - Oh.
Well, I'll call you later on\\
342 - to see how you're getting on.\\
343 - Well, thank you, Dr. Rabwin.\\
344 - Not at all.\\
345 - Good day, ladies.
Bye.\\
346 - Oh, my bag.\\
347 - Now, how am I going to make Ricky\\
348 - the center of attention?\\
349 - I don't know.\\
350 - Why don't you give him a baby shower.\\
351 - Don't try to be funny.
Try to help me.\\
352 - Hey, you know, that's not such a bad
idea, at that:\\
353 - A daddy shower.\\
354 - Yeah! We can have the men come\\
355 - and give Ricky presents for the baby.\\
356 - Who could give it for him?\\
357 - Fred, who else?\\
358 - Do you think he would?\\
359 - He'd love it.\\
360 - Come on, let's go tell him.\\
361 - Okay.\\
362 - What happened?\\
363 - What'd he say?
Did he like the idea?\\
364 - He's crazy about it.\\
365 - You should have seen him perk up when
I told him.\\
366 - He's practically well already.\\
367 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
368 - Here's the list of fellas he wants me
to invite.\\
369 - Oh, Fred, I love you.\\
370 - Mm! Thank you!\\
371 - Wow!\\
372 - I love you too, Fred.\\
373 - Well...\\
374 - (laughing)\\
375 - I hate to leave this little love nest\\
376 - but I'll see you later.\\
377 - Okay. Where are you going?\\
378 - Down to the recreation club.\\
379 - I've got to make arrangements for our
stag party.\\
380 - Oh.
G'bye.\\
381 - So long.
Bye.
Okay. Bye-bye.\\
382 - Oh, gee, won't they have fun?\\
383 - Yeah.\\
384 - Stag party?\\
385 - What happened to the baby shower?\\
386 - Oh, I guess Fred would feel kind of
funny\\
387 - asking men to a baby shower,\\
388 - so he's going to call it a stag
party.\\
389 - Oh.\\
390 - Stag party, huh?\\
391 - Well, it's still a baby shower.\\
392 - It is?\\
393 - Oh, now, Lucy, don't be silly.\\
394 - You want Ricky to get well, don't
you?\\
395 - Sure I want him to get well.\\
396 - But I'd like to know what kind of
medicine he's using.\\
397 - When they call a party "stag,"\\
398 - it means only men are allowed.\\
399 - It does?\\
400 - Yeah.\\
401 - Doesn't it?\\
402 - Well, there's one good way to find
out.\\
403 - How?\\
404 - What if a couple of uninvited stags
showed up?\\
405 - Uninvited sta...?\\
406 - You mean...?\\
407 - Yeah.\\
408 - Oh, Lucy!\\
409 - We could disguise ourselves.\\
410 - What are you going to go as, an
expectant father?\\
411 - Even if we could disguise ourselves,\\
412 - they know everybody who's going to be
there.\\
413 - Well, now, just leave it to me.\\
414 - I'll think of something.\\
415 - RICKY: Sure. Yes, sir.\\
416 - Well, we'll be happy to have you.\\
417 - Yeah, well, come right over.\\
418 - Okay, thank you. Bye.\\
419 - Hey, Fred?\\
420 - Yeah?\\
421 - This is getting to be quite an
affair.\\
422 - Why?\\
423 - Well, you know who that was on the
phone?\\
424 - No.
It's a reporter.\\
425 - Yeah. He wants to bring a
photographer over\\
426 - and they want to cover the first
daddy shower.\\
427 - Well, that sounds interesting.\\
428 - What paper was it?\\
429 - He didn't say.\\
430 - Wouldn't it be wonderful\\
431 - if we made the society page?\\
432 - Oh, boy.\\
433 - (laughing)\\
434 - I can see it now.\\
435 - "Fred Mertz poured last night\\
436 - "for Ricky Ricardo\\
437 - and some of his most intimate slobs."\\
438 - Well, here's the gang.\\
439 - Hi! Congratulations.\\
440 - (men talking excitedly)\\
441 - (whistling)\\
442 - Break it up, now, boys.
Break it up.\\
443 - Now, remember, this is a shower,\\
444 - and let's do it right.\\
445 - Now, first, everybody put their
presents\\
446 - on that table.\\
447 - FRED: All right...\\
448 - right over here.\\
449 - Oh, fellas!
(laughing): Oh, gee whiz.\\
450 - Oh, isn't that...?\\
451 - Look-- "From Jerry."\\
452 - Oh, yeah.\\
453 - Oh, Jerry, you didn't have to do it.\\
454 - Oh, well, it was nothing, Rick.\\
455 - Just what I always wanted.\\
456 - Oh, just a little something I thought
you could use.\\
457 - Oh, that's nice.\\
458 - Well, let's start opening the
presents, huh?\\
459 - (men clamoring)\\
460 - Yes?\\
461 - Is this the Ricardo party?\\
462 - Yes, I'm Ricky Ricardo.\\

492 - JERRY: Oh, is that right?
Yeah.\\
493 - Well, uh, what do you like to know?\\
494 - Well, now, whose idea was this here
shower?\\
495 - Uh, that was mine.\\
496 - Oh, is that so, Mr. Mertz?\\
497 - Yes. I said to my old battle ax, I
said...\\
498 - "Why should the mother...\\
499 - "why should the mothers get all the
breaks?\\
500 - Why don't we do something about the
fathers?"\\
501 - Oh, you said that, huh?\\
502 - That's what I said, yeah.\\
503 - You're looking for a story, are you?\\
504 - I sure am.\\
505 - Well, I've got a great story for you,
Pete.\\
506 - Oh, well, go ahead.\\
507 - Yeah! Of course, you'd never be able\\
508 - to print this in a newspaper, you
know.\\
509 - (laughing)\\
510 - Tell it, Jerry. Go on!\\
511 - All right. All right.\\
512 - Well, you see, there was this fella--\\
513 - he was a bachelor, a sort of a man
about town,\\
514 - and he goes into this nightclub in
Paris.\\
515 - Ah...!\\
516 - You say this whole thing was your
idea, huh, Mr. Mertz?\\
517 - Just a minute, Pete.\\
518 - Just a minute, will you?\\
519 - Just let the young man tell his...\\
520 - Yeah, let him tell the story, will
you?\\
521 - Come back here, please?
Let the fella tell it.\\
522 - Now, one night, he goes into this
nightclub, see?\\

dancer,\\
525 - Yeah, yeah?\\
526 - she's doing her act.

532 - Now, do you get the picture?\\

558 - that keep his mustache on with Scotch
tape.\\
559 - Fred, how did you see through my
disguise?\\
560 - What disguise?\\
561 - Well, we just wanted to see what went
on at a stag party.\\
562 - Are you mad?\\
563 - No, sweetheart, I'm not mad.\\
564 - (laughing)\\
565 - Oh, that tickles.\\
566 - Ooh, it's cold outside.\\
567 - Hi. Did you get everything?\\
568 - Yeah, I got everything.\\
569 - But if you don't stop having these
silly cravings\\
570 - at 4:00 in the morning, I'm gonna
freeze to death.\\
571 - Here.\\
572 - Is this pistachio?\\
573 - Yeah, that's pistachio.\\
574 - Here's your spoon.\\
575 - Which is that?\\
576 - Hot fudge.\\
577 - Pour it on top.\\
578 - That's right.\\
579 - Ooh. Now, pour that right on top of
this.\\
580 - But, honey, these are sardines.\\
581 - I know.\\
582 - Right on top.\\
583 - Oh, boy.\\
584 - Honey, how can you possibly eat that?\\
585 - Wonderful. Mmm!\\
586 - You know, I'm surprised\\
587 - that you didn't get any cravings.\\
588 - Me? When?\\
589 - When you were sick the other day\\
590 - 'cause you weren't getting enough
attention.\\
591 - I was sick because I ate something\\
592 - that made me sick.\\
593 - Yes, dear.\\
594 - Well, I was!\\
595 - Yeah. All right.\\
596 - You were.\\
597 - Funny how you snapped out of it,
though,\\
598 - after the doctor told us what we
should do.\\
599 - What do you mean?\\
600 - Uh... nothing, dear.\\
601 - Did the doctor tell you\\
602 - to give me that daddy shower\\
603 - just so I get some attention?\\
604 - No.\\
605 - No, he just said that if we, you
know, kind of\\
606 - made you feel that, well...\\
607 - What's the matter?\\
608 - I don't know.\\
609 - I feel kind of funny.\\
610 - Again?!\\
611 - Hey, that looks pretty good.\\
612 - Give me some, will you?\\
613 - Are you crazy?
No, I'm not crazy.\\
614 - Now don't be silly.\\
615 - That looks good.
I got to have some.\\
616 - Now, come on, give me some of that.\\
617 - Ricky! Ricky, now stop!\\

\subsection {Episode 15: Lucy Becomes a Sculptress}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Hi, honey.\\
3 - Hi.\\
4 - Say, what are you doing up so late?\\
5 - Oh, I'm just looking at the pictures\\
6 - in this family album.\\
7 - Gee, they're wonderful.\\
8 - How do you happen\\
9 - to start looking at those?\\
10 - Well, I guess I was wondering\\
11 - what our baby might look like.\\
12 - Look. This is me, eight months old.\\
13 - (Ricky laughing)\\
14 - Gee, what are you laughing at?\\
15 - Look at this.\\
16 - What did they call you, "fancy
pants"?\\
17 - Everything's at half-mast.\\
18 - Oh, now, of course at two\\
19 - I was very sophisticated.\\
20 - Get that hair ribbon.\\
21 - I think it's cute.\\
22 - Oh, no!\\
23 - Well, that was just about the time\\
24 - I joined the navy.\\
25 - Oh-ho...\\
26 - Gee, that's cute.\\
27 - I think you were handsome.\\
28 - I hope our baby looks the way you
did.\\
29 - Oh, you're sweet.\\
30 - Hey, who's that character?\\
31 - Oh.\\
32 - That's my great grandfather.\\
33 - He was an artist.\\
34 - He'd better be, in that outfit.\\
35 - Well, no cracks now.\\
36 - He was very good.\\
37 - Gee, Ricky, isn't it wonderful--\\
38 - all the musical and artistic talent\\
39 - that our baby will be surrounded
with?\\
40 - Yeah.\\
41 - Oh, dear. Surrounded with music and
art.\\
42 - Hey, who are we going to get to teach
him about art?\\
43 - Well, honey, I wouldn't worry about
it.\\
44 - It'll take care of itself somehow.\\
45 - Well, now, it's not that easy.\\
46 - Our child's artistic and cultural
future is at stake.\\
47 - Well, there's just one thing for me
to do.\\
48 - I know I shouldn't ask this, but what
is it?\\
49 - I'll have to become an artist.\\
50 - Now, Lucy, don't be ridiculous.\\
51 - I'm not being ridiculous.\\
52 - I undoubtedly inherited a world of
talent\\
53 - from my great grandfather.\\
54 - Well... where is it?\\
55 - It's been sleeping for three
generations.\\
56 - I just have to wake it up.\\
57 - Look, will you do me a favor?\\
58 - Pull down the blinds and let it
sleep.\\
59 - Oh, now I'm not doing this for me,
Ricky.\\
60 - I'm doing it for the future of our
child.\\
61 - Well, I guess it won't hurt anything\\
62 - if you dabble in some watercolors for
a while,\\
63 - but don't get too involved.\\
64 - You haven't got much time before the
baby gets here.\\
65 - Hey, you're right.\\
66 - I have to become a fine artist in
three weeks.\\
67 - (laughing)\\
68 - (door bell dings)\\
69 - How do you do?\\
70 - Oh, uh, how do you do?\\
71 - May I help you?\\
72 - Yes, I'd like some art supplies,
please.\\
73 - Which of the media do you employ?\\
74 - I beg your pardon?\\
75 - Well, we have a complete stock of all
the media.\\
76 - Media?\\
77 - Uh, what you like to work in.\\
78 - Oh...\\
79 - (chuckling)\\
80 - ...just an old smock.\\
81 - Oh, I see.\\
82 - Well, tell me\\
83 - what do you like to use?\\
84 - We have equipment for any kind of
artwork--\\
85 - uh, watercolors, oils, pastel, finger
painting.\\
86 - Oh, finger painting-- that sounds
good.\\
87 - I won't have to buy anything.\\
88 - I already have fingers.\\
89 - Are these the kind you need?\\
90 - Stop.\\
91 - Just a minute.\\
92 - Do it again.\\
93 - Do what?\\
94 - Hold up your hand just the way you
did it before.\\
95 - (gasping)\\
96 - Those hands.\\
97 - What expression.\\
98 - What symmetry.\\
99 - Those long, expressive fingers.\\
100 - Oh, those are the hands of a
sculptor.\\
101 - They are?\\
102 - They certainly are.\\
103 - Oh, you must be very talented.\\
104 - Well, I don't know.\\
105 - I've never...\\
106 - I've never sculpt...
uh... sculpteded before.\\
107 - Well, I just couldn't be wrong.\\
108 - No?\\
109 - No.\\
110 - Here.\\
111 - Create something for me.\\
112 - Oh, I couldn't.\\
113 - I don't know how.\\
114 - Try. Your talent will tell you how.\\
115 - (giggling)\\
116 - Oh, go ahead.\\
117 - Don't be inhibited.\\
118 - Dig right in with both hands.\\
119 - Well...\\
120 - Stop!
Ah!\\
121 - Wait.\\
122 - Did I do something wrong?\\
123 - Wrong?\\
124 - Was Michelangelo wrong?\\
125 - I don't know.\\
126 - Just a moment ago\\
127 - this was a shapeless mass of clay,\\
128 - and look at it now.\\
129 - Just look at it--\\
130 - such form, such rhythm...\\
131 - such movement.\\
132 - Oh, it's just something I squeezed
together.\\
133 - Yes, yes,\\
134 - but it's the way you squeezed it.\\
135 - The world is waiting for a squeezer
like yours.\\
136 - Oh, you're just saying that.\\
137 - D-Do you really think that that...?\\
138 - Please, please,\\
139 - don't take my word for it.\\
140 - You've certainly heard of our owner,\\
141 - Mr. William Abbott--\\
142 - the famous art connoisseur.\\
143 - Oh, uh, uh, oh, yeah.\\
144 - Just a moment.\\
145 - Uh... Mr. Abbott!\\
146 - Mr. Abbott.\\
147 - I won't say a word.\\
148 - You do all the talking.\\
149 - Okay.\\
150 - Mr. Abbott, this is Mrs., uh...\\
151 - Ricardo.
Ricardo.\\
152 - How do you do?
How do you do?\\
153 - Uh, Mr. Abbott, I was wondering if...\\
154 - This figure.\\
155 - This-this-this-this...
this masterpiece.\\
156 - Where did you get it?\\
157 - Did it just come in?\\
158 - That's what I wanted to talk to you
about, Mr. Abbott.\\
159 - You see...\\
160 - Oh, I'm sorry, madame.\\
161 - This is not for sale.\\
162 - I'm putting this in my own
collection.\\
163 - Oh, well, y... you don't understand,
Mr. Abbott.\\
164 - No, no, you don't understand,\\
165 - Mr. Abbott.\\
166 - Mrs. Ricardo just made it\\
167 - before my own eyes with her own
hands.\\
168 - With these.\\
169 - It's breathtaking.\\
170 - Really?\\
171 - Well, you know, now that I look at
it,\\
172 - it isn't bad at all, is it?\\
173 - It's the first thing I ever tried.\\
174 - Oh!\\
175 - She's considering taking up
sculpturing.\\
176 - Oh, you must.\\
177 - You owe it to cultural society.\\
178 - The world is calling.\\
179 - Me?\\
180 - Well, then, I'd better answer.\\
181 - Uh, h-how much clay will I need to
start?\\
182 - Uh, ten pounds?\\
183 - Make it 25.\\
184 - Make it 50.\\
185 - 50?\\
186 - You have a big talent.\\
187 - Oh.\\
188 - Well, y-you just send anything that I
need to this address.\\
189 - And, uh...\\
190 - thank you.\\
191 - I feel a great discovery has been
made here today.\\
192 - I will personally handle your first
exhibit.\\
193 - Well...\\
194 - Uh, put that in my private
collection.\\
195 - Now, what are you doing,\\
196 - and what is that crazy getup you got
on?\\
197 - This is an artist smock and a tam.\\
198 - A smock and a tam?\\
199 - Sure. It's what all us
sculptressesses wear.\\
200 - All us what-essesses?\\
201 - Never mind now.\\
202 - Don't bother me, I'm busy.
I'm sculpting.\\
203 - How did you get mixed up in all this
mud pie stuff?\\
204 - Well, I tried it at the art store
this morning,\\
205 - and both the salesman and the owner\\
206 - said that I had exceptional talent.\\
207 - There.\\
208 - How do you like it?\\
209 - You made that, huh?\\
210 - Yeah.\\
211 - All by yourself?\\
212 - Yeah. Do you like it?\\
213 - Like it? Why, honey, it's, uh...\\
214 - I mean, I've never seen anything
quite like this.\\
215 - It's the most, uh...\\
216 - And you made that all by yourself?\\
217 - Oh, I'll bet you don't even know what
it is.\\
218 - Oh, honey, now how can you say that?\\
219 - Anyone can tell what it is.\\
220 - Well, what is it?\\
221 - Let me look at it from the back, eh?\\
222 - Okay.\\
223 - Well?\\
224 - That's the back of it, all right.\\
225 - Oh, now, Ricky, come on.\\
226 - Tell me what it is.\\
227 - A boy and his dog?\\
228 - No.\\
229 - A girl and her dog?\\
230 - No, and I don't think you're being
very funny.\\
231 - Okay, I give up.\\
232 - What is it?\\
233 - It's a child at its mother's knee.\\
234 - Oh, why, sure.\\
235 - I can see it now, yeah.\\
236 - Sure.\\
237 - Oh, look at that cute expression\\
238 - on the child's face.\\
239 - Kootchie, kootchie, kootchie,
kootchie...\\
240 - That's the knee.\\
241 - That's the knee?\\
242 - Yes.\\
243 - Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.\\
244 - Hi, Ricky.\\
245 - Hi, Ethel.\\
246 - Hi, Lucy.
How you doing?\\
247 - Hi, Ethel.
I'm glad you're here.\\
248 - At least you have taste and
appreciation for art.\\
249 - I do?\\
250 - Well, you certainly have more taste\\
251 - than some people I know around here.\\
252 - Now go ahead, tell Ricky what this
is.\\
253 - Hmm.\\
254 - Hmm...\\
255 - Well, go ahead, tell him what it is.\\
256 - It's as plain as the nose on your
face.\\
257 - Oh, yeah.\\
258 - Well?\\
259 - Is it the nose on somebody's face?\\
260 - No, it isn't!\\
261 - No, Ethel.\\
262 - It's a mother with her nose in her
knee.\\
263 - (laughing)\\
264 - The two of you think you're so smart.\\
265 - I think this is pretty good,\\
266 - considering I did it from
imagination.\\
267 - I didn't have a model, you know.\\
268 - Well, maybe a model would help.\\
269 - Well, of course a model would help.\\
270 - All great artists have models.\\
271 - I wish I knew someplace where I could
get...\\
272 - Good-bye.
I got to go to the club.\\
273 - I got to go, Lucy, I hear Fred
calling.\\
274 - Ethel, you come right back here.\\
275 - You do not hear Fred calling you.\\
276 - Yes, I do.\\
277 - I'll be right there, Fred!\\
278 - Ethel, I'm very disappointed you
won't model for me\\
279 - because you have such classic beauty.\\
280 - What did you say I had?\\
281 - Classic beauty.\\
282 - I do?\\
283 - Sure.\\
284 - Look at that head, that profile.\\
285 - It's like the head on a Greek coin.\\
286 - You really think so, Lucy?\\
287 - Yeah.\\
288 - I always thought my head was kind...\\
289 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
290 - I'm not going to model for you.\\
291 - Now, Ethel...\\
292 - No.\\
293 - Well, who will I get?\\
294 - I don't know,\\
295 - but it's not going to be me.\\
296 - Oh...\\
297 - Lucy, did I tell you about Jane
Sebastian?\\
298 - Ethel, will you please hold your head
still?\\
299 - Well, her baby\\
300 - was due last week, and it didn't
arrive,\\
301 - and it didn't arrive.\\
302 - And when they finally rushed her to
the hospital,\\
303 - what did she do but have twins.\\
304 - Ethel, how can I do anything right\\
305 - if you keep moving your head?\\
306 - Well, I got a crick in my neck.\\
307 - Let me see what I look like.\\
308 - Boy, I'm not a bit well.\\
309 - Well, it's not supposed to be\\
310 - an exact copy of you.\\
311 - I know that.\\
312 - Where's my face?\\
313 - Right there.\\
314 - What's this supposed to be?\\
315 - That's your ear.\\
316 - What's it doing over my mouth?\\
317 - Well, you moved so much, I couldn't
tell where it was.\\
318 - What's this?\\
319 - That's your nose.\\
320 - On top of my head?\\
321 - Well, I know it isn't where it's
supposed to be,\\
322 - but isn't it a nice nose?\\
323 - It's lovely.\\
324 - You know, Ethel, I think that\\
325 - I should do a full-length figure of
you in action.\\
326 - Okay, you can do a statue of me\\
327 - running down the back stairs.\\
328 - Good-bye.\\
329 - Oh, Ethel Mertz, you come back here!\\
330 - Oh, darn it.\\
331 - Hi, Lucy.\\
332 - Hi.\\
333 - I thought I'd find Ethel up here.\\
334 - Well, she was,\\
335 - but she had to leave for a minute.\\
336 - I know you're busy, so I won't bother
you.\\
337 - Fred, turn sideways.\\
338 - What for?\\
339 - That profile.\\
340 - Huh?\\
341 - You know, I never noticed it before,\\
342 - but you have real classic features.\\
343 - I do?\\
344 - Yeah.\\
345 - Your head is like the head on a Greek
coin.\\
346 - Hey, Lucy, how long do I have to stay
like this?\\
347 - I'm getting kind of tired.\\
348 - Just a few more minutes, Fred, then
you can rest.\\
349 - I hope so.\\
350 - (Ricky whistling)\\
351 - (laughing)\\
352 - What's so funny?\\
353 - Yes, I fail to see what's so
hilarious.\\
354 - Oh, no, that getup that you got on.\\
355 - And you should see what she's doing
to you over here.\\
356 - Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.\\
357 - Well, then maybe I'd better take a
look.\\
358 - Come on, Fred, take a look.\\
359 - I'll be glad to have you see it.\\
360 - I think it's coming along very
nicely.\\
361 - Well, straighten up, Fred.\\
362 - Take a rest for a while.\\
363 - I'd be glad to straighten up\\
364 - except for one thing.\\
365 - What?\\
366 - I can't.\\
367 - Oh, no.\\
368 - Easy, Rick, easy.\\
369 - What's the matter?\\
370 - You better wait.\\
371 - I'd better go down\\
372 - and have Ethel put some liniment on
it.\\
373 - LUCY: Ah, gee, Fred, I'm sorry.\\
374 - Ah, it's okay.\\
375 - As long as I'm in this position, I
think I'll go bowling.\\
376 - (Ricky laughing)\\
377 - Watch it now, Fred.\\
378 - Watch it going downstairs.\\
379 - Take it easy now, Fred.\\
380 - Take it easy.\\
381 - Oh, no...\\
382 - Lucy, look what you did to poor
Hercules Mertz.\\
383 - I wonder if Michelangelo had this
trouble with his models.\\
384 - Oh, honey, you can't expect Fred\\
385 - to pose like a professional model.\\
386 - Hey, that's what I need.\\
387 - What?\\
388 - A professional model.\\
389 - Now wait a minute.\\
390 - They cost a lot of money-- eight or
ten dollars an hour.\\
391 - Don't you want your child\\
392 - surrounded by art and culture?\\
393 - Not at ten bucks a throw I don't.\\
394 - Well, if you're going to be crass...\\
395 - I am not being crass.\\
396 - And what does that mean?\\
397 - It means you care more for money than
you do our child.\\
398 - I do not, honey.\\
399 - We just haven't got that kind of
money to spend.\\
400 - Oh!\\
401 - Look, honey, we've already spent a
fortune on the baby--\\
402 - nursery things, furniture, layette.\\
403 - As it is, I'm going to have to pay
for them on time.\\
404 - It's not that bad.\\
405 - It is, too. If they deliver the baby
C.O.D.,\\
406 - I'm going to have to send him back.\\
407 - You don't love me or the baby.\\
408 - Oh, now, honey, you know I do.\\
409 - You do not.\\
410 - Now, look, sweetheart.\\
411 - If I thought that you had any kind of
talent at this,\\
412 - money would be no object.\\
413 - Really?\\
414 - Well, you just ask Mr. William
Abbott--\\
415 - he's the owner of the art store,\\
416 - and he's a famous connoisseur, and he
said I was brilliant.\\
417 - He also wanted to sell you some clay.\\
418 - Oh, you have such a sneaky,
suspicious mind.\\
419 - All right, I'll tell you what I'll
do.\\
420 - I'll make a deal with you.\\
421 - I'll get one of the art critics\\
422 - from one of the papers\\
423 - to come up to the house and look at
your work.\\
424 - If he says that you have any kind of
talent,\\
425 - you can have anything you want.\\
426 - Really, Ricky?\\
427 - Yeah, but wait a minute now.\\
428 - If he says no, that you don't have
any talent,\\
429 - then you forget this whole business.\\
430 - It's a deal.
Okay.\\
431 - Good morning, Lucy.\\
432 - Hi.\\
433 - I came to get some more liniment\\
434 - for Fred's arm.\\
435 - I'm sorry.
I gave you all we had.\\
436 - How is his arm?\\
437 - Is it any better?\\
438 - It's pretty good.\\
439 - We got it down to here now.\\
440 - Well, that's good.\\
441 - Say, Ethel, would you do me a favor?\\
442 - No!\\
443 - Oh, Ethel, come back here.\\
444 - I don't want you to model for me.\\
445 - I have a model--\\
446 - someone who appreciates my work\\
447 - and who'll pose for me as long as I
want.
Who?\\
448 - Me.\\
449 - You?\\
450 - Yes. I'm going to make a bust of
myself.\\
451 - I thought you'd already done that.\\
452 - (laughs)\\
453 - Ricky's bringing home an art critic\\
454 - to look at my work.\\
455 - And I think that if I make a perfect
replica of my head,\\
456 - it will really impress him.\\
457 - Well, I hope your head turns out\\
458 - better than Fred's arm.\\
459 - It will.\\
460 - This book tells how to make a mold\\
461 - of anything that you want to copy.\\
462 - You mean, you're going to make a mold
of your..?\\
463 - Yeah. I'm going to make an impression\\
464 - of my head and face.\\
465 - I'm going to put clay in it, take the
mold away,\\
466 - and I'll have a perfect replica of my
head.\\
467 - Hey, Lucy, that's a wonderful idea.\\
468 - Yeah, and it's so easy, too.
I got the plaster all mixed.\\
469 - Now listen, "Cover the object to be
copied\\
470 - "with plaster of paris and let it
remain this way\\
471 - "until the plaster hardens.\\
472 - Then crack away..." Lucy!\\
473 - What?\\
474 - You mean, you're going to bury your
head\\
475 - in plaster of paris?\\
476 - Sure.\\
477 - But you won't be able to breathe.\\
478 - Oh. I never thought of that.\\
479 - Well, what am I going to do?\\
480 - It has to be a perfect likeness to
get by that art critic.\\
481 - Maybe the book tells some other way
to do it.\\
482 - Let's see.\\
483 - What's the matter?\\
484 - Ethel!
I can't get my arm out!\\
485 - You're stuck?\\
486 - Oh, hey, look, pull, pull hard.\\
487 - I can't get it out!\\
488 - Well, let me try...\\
489 - Oh, Lucy...\\
490 - Right this way, Mr. Harvey.\\
491 - You'll see what I mean.\\
492 - Hi, Ricky.\\
493 - Oh, hi, Ethel.\\
494 - Uh, this is, uh, Mr. Harvey, the art
critic of the Times.\\
495 - Mrs. Mertz, Mr. Harvey.\\
496 - How do you do?\\
497 - How do you do?\\
498 - Uh, where's Lucy?\\
499 - Oh, she had to go down to the store.\\
500 - Well, that's funny.\\
501 - She knew I was bringing Mr. Harvey
home.\\
502 - Oh, she'll be right back.\\
503 - Would you like me to show you her
work?\\
504 - Oh, no, I th...
I think we better, uh, wait\\
505 - till Lucy gets here.\\
506 - Uh, if you don't mind, Mr. Ricardo,\\
507 - I always prefer\\
508 - to look at these amateur attempts\\
509 - uh, without the artist being present.\\
510 - Oh, all right.\\
511 - What did she sculpt this time?\\
512 - She made a head of herself.\\
513 - She did, huh?\\
514 - Oh, you should have seen her.\\
515 - She put up seven mirrors all around\\
516 - so she'd cover every angle.\\
517 - (chuckling): Oh, no.\\
518 - Oh, this is really pretty good.\\
519 - Are you ready?\\
520 - Oh, I can hardly wait.\\
521 - All right.\\
522 - There.\\
523 - Hey, you know something?\\
524 - It kind of looks like her.\\
525 - I told you it was good.\\
526 - This is excellent, Ricardo,
excellent!\\
527 - It is, huh?\\
528 - Oh, my boy, believe me, if this is a
sample\\
529 - of your wife's first attempt at
sculpturing,\\
530 - you're married to a genius.\\
531 - Well, what do you know?\\
532 - Oh, Lucy will be so happy when she
hears this.\\
533 - Oh, this is fine, fine.\\
534 - Say, look, do me a favor.\\
535 - Sure. What?\\
536 - I-It's always a tremendous thrill\\
537 - for me to be in at the launching\\
538 - of a great artistic career.\\
539 - Let me buy this.\\
540 - He wants to buy it.\\
541 - Buy it?\\
542 - Yes.\\
543 - I-I'd like to add it\\
544 - to my private collection.\\
545 - Oh, oh, Mr. Harvey,\\
546 - you can't have that for your private
collection.\\
547 - I don't... I don't think Lucy'd want
to sell it.\\
548 - Oh, what are you talking about?\\
549 - I would think she'd be delighted to
sell it.\\
550 - Oh, you don't know how hard she
worked on this.\\
551 - She put a lot of herself into this
statue.\\
552 - Well, I guess she's right.\\
553 - I guess it'll have to be up to Lucy.\\
554 - Well, I don't have time to wait.\\
555 - I'm-I'm due at an art critic's
meeting.\\
556 - Uh, let me know if she'll sell it,
will you?\\
557 - All right. Thank you for coming out,
Mr. Harvey.\\
558 - Oh, Mr. Ricardo.\\
559 - I'd love to have this at that meeting
with me.\\
560 - Won't you let me buy it?\\
561 - Well, uh...\\
562 - no, I-I'm afraid I couldn't take the
responsibility.\\
563 - I'll pay $500.\\
564 - ETHEL: Oh, no!\\
565 - I'll take the responsibility.\\
566 - Mr. Harvey, you mustn't do that.\\
567 - This statue isn't worth $500.\\
568 - Well, I believe\\
569 - I know what a statue is worth, Mrs.
Mertz.\\
570 - I'll write you a check.\\
571 - Thank you.\\
572 - Um...\\
573 - uh...\\
574 - um...\\
575 - Mr. Harvey,\\
576 - don't you think you ought to take
another look at this?\\
577 - It really isn't worth that much
money.\\
578 - It isn't quite right.\\
579 - Now look at that mouth.\\
580 - You know the-the side of it should be
up higher.\\
581 - Like that.\\
582 - Ethel!\\
583 - And this-this side of it should be
lower.\\
584 - Like that.\\
585 - HARVEY: Oh, Mrs. Mertz.\\
586 - And, you know, the whole thing's too
long.\\
587 - Don't you think it should be like
that?\\
588 - Ethel, now look what you done!\\
589 - You ruined it!\\
590 - HARVEY: Oh, no, she hasn't ruined it.\\
591 - I haven't?\\
592 - No.\\
593 - Uh, do you know something that when
Mrs. Ricardo\\
594 - is a famous sculptress,\\
595 - this will be a-a collector's item.
Here.\\
596 - Thank you.
Oh, wait!\\
597 - I'll deliver it anyplace you want me
to.\\
598 - Oh, no.\\
599 - I wouldn't trust this to any other
hands\\
600 - but my own.\\
601 - (Lucy screaming)\\
602 - Oh, give me that check!\\
603 - What kind of a ridiculous...?!\\
604 - I didn't have anything\\
605 - to do with this, Mr. Harvey!\\

\subsection {Episode 16: Lucy Goes to the Hospital}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Nah!\\
3 - Ricky?\\
4 - I can't figure out which kind of
makeup\\
5 - to use for that show tonight.\\
6 - Ricky, I just called the doctor.\\
7 - You did? Why?\\
8 - Oh, I feel sort of funny.\\
9 - Oh? What did he say?\\
10 - He said it might be any time now.\\
11 - Oh, that's nice, honey. We can
always...\\
12 - Any time now?!\\
13 - Now, honey, please, please, please
don't get excited.\\
14 - Don't worry, I-I'll know when it's
time\\
15 - to leave for the hospital.\\
16 - Now, honey, I-I think\\
17 - we better go now.\\
18 - Now-now-now Ricky, just relax, dear.\\
19 - There's plenty of time.\\
20 - Now, just relax.\\
21 - (sighs)\\
22 - Is there anything I can get you?\\
23 - No, dear, not a thing.\\
24 - Are you sure you're all right?\\
25 - Yes, honey. I'm fine.\\
26 - Now-now, you just sit down and relax.
Huh?\\
27 - Look, now, Ricky.\\
28 - It may be hours, may be days.\\
29 - Why don't you go down to the club?\\
30 - Go down to the club when you going to
have a baby?\\
31 - Yeah.\\
32 - They can get along without me for one
night.\\
33 - Oh, but not on opening night.\\
34 - This is a brand-new show.\\
35 - Oh, I forgot all about that.\\
36 - How do you like that?\\
37 - Opening a show on the night that you
going to have a baby.\\
38 - What lousy planning.\\
39 - Well, I don't care.\\
40 - I'm going to stay right here with
you.\\
41 - Now, Ricky, be sensible.
The doctor will be there.\\
42 - All you can do is just sit there and
worry.\\
43 - I know, I know,\\
44 - but I want you to know that I am
sitting there worrying.\\
45 - I want you to feel that I'm near.\\
46 - Well, I'd like to feel that you're
near, too,\\
47 - but I don't want you to lose your
job.\\
48 - I'd like to feel that the baby's
going to eat for a while.\\
49 - Oh, honey, I-I don't...\\
50 - Now, Ricky, it's the only sensible
thing to do.\\
51 - I insist that you go to the club.\\
52 - All right, honey.\\
53 - If that's what you want me to do,\\
54 - I'll... I'll go to the club.\\
55 - (sighs)\\
56 - Hey, honey, will you do something for
me?\\
57 - Anything, dear.\\
58 - What is it?\\
59 - Well, look, I don't have to be at the
club until 8:00.\\
60 - Mm-hmm.\\
61 - That gives you three and a half
hours.\\
62 - I'll do the best I can.\\
63 - As a matter of fact, you know,\\
64 - I don't go on stage until 9:00.\\
65 - I can get there in 15 minutes.\\
66 - 15 minutes to make up-- you can have
till 8:30.\\
67 - Thank you.\\
68 - Ricky...?\\
69 - Hey, is it time?\\
70 - No.\\
71 - Now, honey, calm down,\\
72 - or you're going to fall apart.\\
73 - Why don't you do something?\\
74 - Do something. Okay.\\
75 - What am I going to do?\\
76 - Uh, get me something to drink.\\
77 - Okay, honey. Sure.\\
78 - Uh, what would you like?\\
79 - Oh, glass of milk.\\
80 - A glass of milk? Okay.\\
81 - Would you like something else, baby?\\
82 - Oh, some cookies.\\
83 - Cookies.\\
84 - That'd be nice.\\
85 - Okay. Now, don't go anyplace.\\
86 - I'll be right back.
Stay right there.\\
87 - Hello, Ethel. Ethel, will you do me a
favor?\\
88 - Could you and Fred come up here for a
few minutes?\\
89 - Well, the doctor said it would be any
minute now\\
90 - and Ricky's driving me crazy.\\
91 - Yeah, he keeps staring at me\\
92 - like I'm going to explode any minute.\\
93 - Yeah, well, come up and treat the
whole thing\\
94 - very casually, will you?\\
95 - Okay. Bye-bye.\\
96 - Oh, thank you, dear.\\
97 - There you are, honey.
Cookie?\\
98 - Uh-huh.\\
99 - (doorbell ringing)\\
100 - Hello?\\
101 - Honey, it's the door.\\
102 - Oh.\\
103 - Hi, Ricky.\\
104 - Oh, hi. Hi.\\
105 - Hi, folks.\\
106 - Hiya, Fred.\\
107 - Hi.
Hi, Lucy.\\
108 - We weren't doing anything,\\
109 - so we thought we'd just come up\\
110 - and see how you are.\\
111 - Well, what a nice surprise.\\
112 - Well, what's new?\\
113 - Uh, Lucy's due to leave for the
hospital any minute.\\
114 - Oh, that's nice.\\
115 - I guess you didn't hear what I said.\\
116 - The baby's due any minute--\\
117 - right now, maybe this very second.\\
118 - -Oh. What else is new?
-Fred, did you hear what I said?\\
119 - The baby's due any minute.\\
120 - What's so amazing about that?\\
121 - You knew it would happen sooner or
later.\\
122 - I would think you'd get a little
excited or something.\\
123 - Why? It's a perfectly natural thing.\\
124 - Sure. Babies are born every day.\\
125 - You see, dear? The Mertzes don't get
excited.\\
126 - There's nothing to get upset... upset
about.\\
127 - Is it really due any minute?!\\
128 - How do you feel?!\\
129 - Are you sure you're all right?\\
130 - I think we ought to have a rehearsal!\\
131 - A rehearsal? For what?\\
132 - A rehearsal for when you get the
signal.\\
133 - Everything should go like clockwork.\\
134 - I don't want to lose a minute getting
you to the hospital.\\
135 - She's right. She's right.
Oh, that's a wonderful idea, Ricky.\\
136 - Yeah.
Now, Ricky, Ricky, Ricky\\
137 - T-There's no problem, dear.\\
138 - The room is reserved at the hospital.\\
139 - The doctor's number is right here by
the phone.\\
140 - My suitcase is all packed.\\
141 - All we have to do is go downstairs,
get a cab, and go.\\
142 - I know, I know, but who's going to
call the doctor?\\
143 - Who's going to carry the suitcase?\\
144 - Who's going to hail the cab?\\
145 - That's what we got to rehearse.\\
146 - (all talking at once)\\
147 - (whistling)\\
148 - Hold it. Hold it, group.\\
149 - Look, you-you split it up any way you
want.\\
150 - I'm going to go lie down.\\
151 - All right, honey.\\
152 - I think that's a good idea.\\
153 - You need your rest.\\
154 - Here. I'll help you in.\\
155 - That's nice. Come on, honey.\\
156 - Don't you worry about anything, now.\\
157 - No. I won't.\\
158 - You leave everything to us, honey.\\
159 - Okay.\\
160 - Take it easy.\\
161 - Ricky, it seems to me...
Now, listen, I'll tell you how we
ought to do this...\\
162 - Now, wait a, wait a, now wait a
minute, wait a minute.\\
163 - I'm in charge of this thing.\\
164 - After all, I'm the baby's father.\\
165 - Take over, captain.\\
166 - All right.
Now, let's see.\\
167 - First of all,\\
168 - one of us has to call the doctor.\\
169 - Who's going to do that?\\
170 - I'll do that.\\
171 - Okay. Soon as we get the signal, you
rush to the phone.\\
172 - Okay.\\
173 - All right.
Now, you carry the suitcase.\\
174 - Right.\\
175 - I'll look after Lucy.\\
176 - I'll get her coat, see that she gets
downstairs all right,\\
177 - and we'll hail a cab.\\
178 - Now, let's rehearse.\\
179 - Okay.
Good.\\
180 - Okay. Let's go.\\
181 - Now, let's make believe\\
182 - that Lucy just came out of the
bedroom. See?\\
183 - And she comes out of the bedroom\\
184 - and she says, "The time has come."\\
185 - Go!\\
186 - Hello, Dr. Harris.\\
187 - We're leaving for the hospital with
Mrs. Ricardo now. Good-bye.\\
188 - Hey, that was pretty good.\\
189 - We did that in a few seconds.\\
190 - Fine.
Let's do it again\\
191 - so we'll have everything prefect.\\
192 - Okay.
Now, the main thing is to be calm\\
193 - so we don't get Lucy excited.\\
194 - That's right.
We got to keep calm.\\
195 - Good.
Yeah, right, put that over there,
Fred,\\
196 - so we can start right now.\\
197 - Get it over there...\\
198 - Get it over where it was at the
beginning, now, all right?\\
199 - Go back over there, now.\\
200 - Right.\\
201 - Are you ready?\\
202 - Yep.
Yep.\\
203 - Okay.\\
204 - Now, Lucy comes out of the room and
she says,\\
205 - "The time has come."\\
206 - Go!\\
207 - Hello, Dr. Harris.\\
208 - We're leaving for the hospital with
Mrs. Ricardo now. Good-bye.\\
209 - Hey, that was even better than
before.\\
210 - Great!
Sure it was!\\
211 - Yeah, that was wonderful.\\
212 - Well organized.\\
213 - Okay, now we know what to do.\\
214 - Now, let's put this stuff right where
it was\\
215 - so we know where everything is.\\
216 - ETHEL: Now all we have to do is just
wait.\\
217 - That was fine, kids.\\
218 - That's wonderful.\\
219 - All righty.\\
220 - Just think--\\
221 - tomorrow night at this time,\\
222 - I'm going to be a father.\\
223 - Yes, sir, and I'm going to be a
godfather.\\
224 - And I'm going to be a godmother.\\
225 - Uh-huh.\\
226 - Ricky, this is it.\\
227 - This is..?\\
228 - ALL: This is it!\\
229 - Let's go!\\
230 - Come on! Let's get going!\\
231 - Somebody ought to call the doctor.\\
232 - Call the doctor!\\
233 - No. That's my job!
That's my job!\\
234 - You get the suitcase!\\
235 - The suitcase!
The suitcase!\\
236 - I got it, Fred!\\
237 - We got to get the suitcase!\\
238 - We have to hurry, Ricky!\\
239 - We have to hurry, she says!\\
240 - Oh! The line is busy!\\
241 - Ricky, the line's busy!
The line is busy!\\
242 - (all muttering nervously)
Somebody better put me in a cab\\
243 - and then you call Dr. Harris.
Go! Go get a cab!\\
244 - Go get a cab!\\
245 - Go get a cab!
Go get a cab!\\
246 - BOTH: I'll get the cab.\\
247 - Hey! Wait for me!\\

261 - My suitcase!\\
262 - Her suitcase!
I'll get it!

264 - Another maternity case coming in.\\
265 - Are you sure you're all right?\\
266 - I'm all right, I'm all right.\\
267 - I just got a little dizzy, that's
all.\\
268 - Now, would you like to answer\\
269 - a few questions for me?\\
270 - Uh, what are they?\\
271 - Honey, please, I'll take care of it.\\
272 - I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.\\
273 - I-I just got a little dizzy in the
cab.\\
274 - I see, I see.\\
275 - Must have been something I ate,

godparents\\
367 - waiting at home either.\\
368 - Gee, I only got a couple of more
minutes.\\
369 - I wish she'd hurry.\\
370 - What can you do?\\
371 - Hey, I know how I can save some time.\\
372 - I can put my makeup on in here.\\
373 - That's a good idea.\\
374 - Yeah, that's what I'll do.\\
375 - Yeah.
Oh, listen, Fred, that's Mr. Stanley.\\

391 - It's not a boy?\\
392 - You mean, I've got seven girls?\\
393 - No.\\
394 - No?\\
395 - Come over here.\\
396 - Triplets.\\
397 - Nine girls.\\
398 - Well, you can always plan on a girls'
softball team.\\
399 - (chuckles)\\
400 - (screams)\\
401 - Fred, it's Ricky. Ricky!
It's me!\\
402 - Oh. Oh...\\
403 - Oh.\\
404 - (laughs)\\
405 - Pretty frightening, huh?\\
406 - Oh, I'll say.\\
407 - Listen, any word from Lucy?\\
408 - Nothing.
Not a thing.\\
409 - Oh, darn it.\\
410 - I'm going to have to leave, Fred.\\
411 - I just barely have enough time to get
a taxi\\
412 - and get down to the club.\\
413 - No, no, no, no.
I'll get the taxi.\\
414 - That will give you more time to wait
here.\\
415 - I'll get the taxi.\\
416 - All right, Fred. Thank you.\\
417 - Cab's waiting, Rick.\\
418 - Oh, thank you, Fred.\\
419 - Now, don't you worry about a thing.\\
420 - I'll call you at the club\\
421 - and let you know everything that
happens.\\
422 - Ah, you're a real pal, Fred.\\
423 - And I think I'll call Ethel, too,\\
424 - and have her come down and wait with
me.\\
425 - Okay, Fred.\\
426 - He was right in here a minute ago.\\
427 - Well, he's not here now.\\
428 - If he's in the hospital, we'll find
him. Come on.\\
429 - Day-a\\
430 - Day-a\\
431 - Day-a\\
432 - Day-a\\

446 - Yippee!\\
447 - I'll be right there, Fred.\\
448 - Play something, play something!\\
449 - Hey, I'm a father, I'm a father!\\
450 - (all clamoring)\\
451 - MAN: Hey, what is it, a boy or a
girl?\\
452 - I forgot to ask.\\
453 - I'll tell you later. Play!\\
454 - Fred, Fred!\\
455 - Oh, thank heavens you're back.\\
456 - This is too much responsibility for
me.\\
457 - -Listen, Fred, Fred, how's Lucy?
-Oh, she's great, but I'm a wreck.\\
458 - From now on, you're going to have
your babies alone.\\
459 - Ah, listen, Fred, Fred, I forgot to
ask you.\\
460 - What is it?\\
461 - It's a... it's a...\\
462 - Fred, Fred!\\
463 - Fred! Tell me what is it?\\
464 - Fred! Fred, tell me...
Fred! What is it? What?!\\
465 - We got here just in time.\\
466 - Come on, let me out of here!
You crazy?!\\
467 - What's going on here?\\
468 - Come on! Oh, Ethel, tell them it's
me, Ricky!\\
469 - Tell them who I am, will you?\\
470 - That's Ricky Ricardo, the orchestra
leader.\\
471 - Fred?! What have you done to Fred?\\
472 - What are you doing in that outfit?\\
473 - I was doing a show down at the club\\
474 - when they called me that my wife just
had the baby.\\
475 - Now let me out of this thing.\\
476 - Oh, we're sorry, Mr. Ricardo.\\
477 - RICKY: All right.\\
478 - Mr. Ricardo?\\
479 - This is Mr. Ricardo.\\
480 - Yes?\\
481 - Uh, they're... bringing...
your... little... boy\\
482 - to the window.\\
483 - A boy.\\
484 - You hear that, I had a boy.\\
485 - (excited yelling)\\

\subsection {Episode 17: Sales Resistance}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - (playing piano)\\
3 - There's a brand-new baby at our house\\
4 - The nicest little gift we've ever had\\
5 - How much fuller life's become\\
6 - No one knows what makes it hum\\
7 - Till you call each other Mommy and
Dad\\
8 - There's a brand-new baby at our house\\
9 - And though he's been there just a
little while\\
10 - In the parlor, in the hall\\
11 - Every picture on the wall\\
12 - Seems to know because they all wear a
smile\\
13 - I can't explain what he does to my
heart\\
14 - With his infant charms\\
15 - I never knew what heaven was\\
16 - Till I held an angel in my arms\\
17 - There's a brand-new baby at our house\\
18 - He's twice as sweet as honey from the
comb\\
19 - He's the image of my spouse, he's the
tricky Mickey Mouse\\
20 - Who has changed our happy house to a
home\\
21 - We thank the Lord\\
22 - Whose love and wondrous powers\\
23 - Gave us that brand-new\\
24 - Grand-new\\
25 - Baby of ours.\\
26 - Oh, Ricky, that was wonderful.\\
27 - That's great.\\
28 - Rick, did you really write that song?\\
29 - Yeah. I wrote it for Lucy.\\
30 - I'm going to take it down to the
hospital\\
31 - and play it for her.\\
32 - See, I was recording it while I was
singing it.\\
33 - Oh, isn't that clever?\\
34 - Where did you get this thing?\\
35 - Well, Lucy bought it to record the
baby's first words.\\
36 - How could she buy it if she's in the
hospital?\\
37 - Well, the lady in the next bed\\
38 - is a salesman for the tape recorder
company.\\
39 - ETHEL: What?\\
40 - Yeah, no kidding.\\
41 - This lady has a baby every year\\
42 - We certainly do.\\
43 - Remember that Handy Dandy Company?\\
44 - Ay-yi-yi.\\
45 - Oh, gee, I'll never forget\\
46 - the expression on Lucy's face that
morning\\
47 - when I brought the mail up to her.\\
48 - Good morning, Lucy.\\
49 - Hi.\\
50 - What's the matter with you?\\
51 - Oh, it's that Cuban sorehead I'm
married to.\\
52 - I just had my weekly lecture about
spending too much money.\\
53 - What'd he have to say this time?\\
54 - I couldn't understand most of it.\\
55 - All I could get was that pesos don't
grow on trees.\\
56 - Well, it's over for another week.\\
57 - I brought up your mail.\\
58 - Good.\\
59 - What's this?\\
60 - Oh, no.\\
61 - Oh, I don't want Ricky to know that I
bought this.\\
62 - This is a kitchen gadget that I saw
demonstrated on television.\\
63 - Where can I hide it?\\
64 - How about the refrigerator?\\
65 - That's a good idea.\\
66 - He'd never look in there.\\
67 - He'll never think of looking in here
in a million years.\\
68 - (Ethel whispering): No, I guess not.\\
69 - There, you think that's safe?\\
70 - Yeah, I think it's safe.\\
71 - Ricky!\\
72 - What's in the package you don't want
me to see?\\
73 - Nothing.\\
74 - Let me see the package.
Nothing.\\
75 - Statue-of-liberty play, Ethel.\\
76 - Okay.\\
77 - Throw it here, Ethel!\\
78 - Now, Ricky, give me that thing.\\
79 - That's mine, Ricky.\\
80 - Now, wait a minute.
Let me see.\\
81 - Let's see what's in the package.\\
82 - Let's see what's in the package.\\
83 - What is it?\\
84 - It's a Handy Dandy kitchen helper.\\
85 - I saw it demonstrated on television.\\
86 - It's a tremendous bargain\\
87 - when you think of all the things you
can do with it.\\
88 - How much is it?\\
89 - Uh, it rices, dices, and splices.\\
90 - Lucy, how much?\\
91 - It cuts down on the time\\
92 - that a housewife has to spend in the
kitchen.\\
93 - How much?\\
94 - About two hours a day.\\
95 - Lucy...\\
96 - $7.98.\\
97 - $7.98!\\
98 - Yeah, but you'd think it was cheap at
twice the price\\
99 - if you saw all the things\\
100 - the man does with it on television.\\
101 - I watch him every day.
Here, I'll show you.\\
102 - FRED: Ethel?
Yeah.\\
103 - You'd better come down and let me see\\
104 - what you want me to do with that
clothesline.\\
105 - Just a minute. Come on in.\\
106 - Lucy's going to give us a
demonstration.\\
107 - Of what?\\
108 - A woman's stupidity.\\
109 - That shouldn't take very long.\\
110 - All right, now you all stand over
there.\\
111 - Now, ladies and gentlemen\\
112 - I am about to demonstrate the Handy
Dandy kitchen helper.\\
113 - It's something you shouldn't be
without.\\
114 - It peels and splices, cuts and rices\\
115 - skins and dices at lowest prices.\\
116 - Now watch me closely, ladies and
gentlemen.\\
117 - I will set the dial for French fries,\\
118 - and then by turning this handle,\\
119 - I will cut this potato into 16
identical slices.\\
120 - Here we go.\\
121 - Oh, I must have had it set for baked
potato.\\
122 - Oh, yeah. Yeah.\\
123 - I didn't have it right on French
fries.\\
124 - That was it.\\
125 - Here we go.\\
126 - 16 identical slices.\\
127 - It looked so easy when the man did it
on television.\\
128 - Oh, honey, maybe you just haven't got
the hang of it yet.\\
129 - Well, I did what they told me.\\
130 - Honestly, Fred, why is it that women\\
131 - have no sales resistance whatsoever?\\
132 - I don't know.
They'll buy anything.\\
133 - Lucy doesn't know\\
134 - the meaning of the word "no."\\
135 - Ethel doesn't either.\\
136 - Lucy is a sucker for any sales pitch.\\
137 - Ethel is too.\\
138 - Lucy and Ethel make me sick.\\
139 - Now, honey, you, you must admit\\
140 - that you'll buy anything that comes
along.\\
141 - I'm no worse than you are.\\
142 - How about that little purchase you
made\\
143 - at the war surplus store?\\
144 - That was a necessary item.\\
145 - Oh, sure. You never know\\
146 - when you're going to use a 20-foot
rubber life raft.\\
147 - What are you laughing at, fatso?\\
148 - You're just as bad.\\
149 - What are you talking about?\\
150 - Now, look, look, look.\\
151 - The fact is that you've just thrown
eight dollars\\
152 - down the drain for... this.\\
153 - $7.95, and it isn't down the drain.\\
154 - I got it on a three-day free trial.\\
155 - If I don't want it, I just call them
up\\
156 - and tell them to take it back.\\
157 - Well, then call them up.\\
158 - No.\\
159 - Lucy, either you're going to call
them up\\
160 - and tell them to take it back,\\
161 - or I'm going to use it to demonstrate
how to cut a wife\\
162 - into 16 identical slices.\\
163 - Really?\\
164 - (door buzzer)\\
165 - Mrs. Ricardo?\\
166 - Yes?\\
167 - I'm Harry Martin of the Handy Dandy
Company.\\
168 - Oh, yes, I've been expecting you.\\
169 - Won't you come in, please?\\
170 - Mr. Martin, this Handy Dandy kitchen
helper does not work\\
171 - and I have it on a three-day free
trial and I don't want it.\\
172 - You'll have to take it back.
Gladly.\\
173 - It isn't any good, and I'm not going
to pay for it.\\
174 - Of course you're not.\\
175 - I see no reason why I should...\\
176 - What'd you say?\\
177 - I said of course you're not going to
pay for it.\\
178 - We don't want you to keep any
merchandise\\
179 - that you're not happy with.\\
180 - You don't?\\
181 - No, of course not,\\
182 - and you're quite right not to want
that.\\
183 - Why, that isn't a wise buy at all.\\
184 - In fact, Mrs. Ricardo,\\
185 - I wouldn't let you keep this dreadful
little gadget\\
186 - even if you begged me to.\\
187 - I'm glad you didn't want that.\\
188 - That shows me that you're a woman of
judgment and taste.\\
189 - Really?\\
190 - Yes, indeed.\\
191 - When you opened that door, I said to
myself, I said,\\
192 - "Harry, there stands a woman of
judgment and taste."\\
193 - Is that so?\\
194 - Mm-hmm.\\
195 - Mrs. Ricardo, you have no idea\\
196 - of the inferior type of humanity\\
197 - that I have to contend with in my
profession.\\
198 - Why, you just wouldn't believe\\
199 - some of the women that I have to talk
to.\\
200 - They... they have no intelligence at
all.\\
201 - My goodness.\\
202 - Mm-hmm.\\
203 - Why, just this morning, I ran in...\\
204 - Say, I'll bet I'm keeping you\\
205 - from something important.\\
206 - Oh, no, no. Not at all.\\
207 - Well, I find you're such an easy
person to talk to\\
208 - and, I don't know, I'd just like to
get this off my chest.\\
209 - Oh, well, go right ahead.\\
210 - May I tell you about what happened to
me this morning?\\
211 - Certainly.\\
212 - Thank you, thank you.\\
213 - Now, you just pretend\\
214 - that you're this woman I'm calling
on, eh?\\
215 - All right.\\
216 - Just stay right there.\\
217 - (door buzzer)\\
218 - What's that?\\
219 - I also represent\\
220 - the Handy Dandy vacuum cleaner.\\
221 - Oh.\\
222 - So this morning when the woman opened
the door\\
223 - and I threw the dirt on the floor,\\
224 - just like I did now\\
225 - and then I handed her a ten-dollar
bill,\\
226 - just like this, you see,\\
227 - and then I said to her\\
228 - I said, "Madam, that ten-dollar bill,\\
229 - "that sawbuck, that one-tenth of a
C-note\\
230 - "is all yours if this Handy Dandy
vacuum cleaner\\
231 - "fails to clean up all this dirt\\
232 - in less than two minutes flat."\\
233 - I said that to her, see?\\
234 - And then I, uh...
I took\\
235 - my Handy Dandy vacuum cleaner\\
236 - and I... I plugged it in...
like this,\\
237 - and then I...
went right to work.\\
238 - That's funny.\\
239 - Oh, this plug is controlled by this
switch.\\
240 - So's that light, see?\\
241 - Oh, I see.\\
242 - Go.\\
243 - 45 seconds.\\
244 - My!\\
245 - That was fast.\\
246 - Yes, it was, wasn't it?\\
247 - But do you know that woman was angry
with me?\\
248 - About what?\\
249 - Because I threw dirt on her floor.\\
250 - But you cleaned it right up\\
251 - with your wonderful Handy Dandy
vacuum cleaner.\\
252 - Yes, yes, of course I did, but she
was still angry\\
253 - and do you know what she did next?\\
254 - What?\\
255 - Why, when I told her\\
256 - that this Handy Dandy vacuum cleaner\\
257 - and the attachments\\
258 - that it sold for $8.95 for the works,\\
259 - why, that shortsighted, narrow-vision
female\\
260 - did not even have the intelligence to
buy one.\\
261 - What a dope.\\
262 - Well, it shows you\\
263 - what you've got to put up with.\\
264 - I'm glad you let me get that off my
chest.\\
265 - Mr. Martin...
did you say, uh, 8.95?\\
266 - That's right.\\
267 - And, uh, now I think I'll have to
go...\\
268 - Mr. Martin, aren't you going to give
me\\
269 - a chance to buy one of those?\\
270 - Oh, Mrs. Ricardo,\\
271 - when I told you about this other
woman,\\
272 - I didn't mean to get you to buy...\\
273 - Oh, but Mr. Martin, our sweeper is so
outdated.\\
274 - It's old, it doesn't work right or
anything\\
275 - and we really do need one of those.\\
276 - Well, as a matter of fact, I...\\
277 - I was bringing this little gem home\\
278 - as a present for my wife, but...\\
279 - Oh...\\
280 - Well, I don't know.\\
281 - I suppose if you really need one.\\
282 - Oh, we do, we do.\\
283 - You talked me into it.\\
284 - Oh, thank you, Mr. Martin.\\
285 - Thank you.\\
286 - Uh... five,\\
287 - six,\\
288 - seven,\\
289 - eight...\\
290 - Mm-hmm.\\
291 - Let's see... 95.
Is that right?\\
292 - That's the price...\\
293 - for the works.\\
294 - Now that you own the works\\
295 - don't you think that you would like\\
296 - this nice gray metal cover\\
297 - to keep it from getting dirty?\\
298 - But didn't I just buy the...?\\
299 - You bought the most important part--\\
300 - yeah, the... the works.\\
301 - Now, there are\\
302 - a few more little accessories,\\
303 - like, like the hose, and the electric
cord\\
304 - and the attachments there.\\
305 - Gee, that must run into quite a bit
of money.\\
306 - No, no, no, not at all.\\
307 - This, this electric cord, for
instance,\\
308 - is only five dollars.\\
309 - Five dollars?!\\
310 - Well, it's extra long.\\
311 - Oh.\\
312 - And, uh...
the attachments, uh...\\
313 - are $2.50.\\
314 - $2.50?\\
315 - Apiece.
Oh.\\
316 - And then there's a utility lamp...\\
317 - Oh?\\
318 - there's a carrying case for the
cleaner...\\
319 - Oh?\\
320 - carrying case for the attachments...\\
321 - Oh?\\
322 - there's a switch that turns it on and
off...\\
323 - Hi, Lucy.\\
324 - Did the man take back the kitchen
helper?\\
325 - Did you have any trouble with him?\\
326 - What's the matter with...?\\
327 - Lucy, did you buy all this stuff from
him?\\
328 - Oh, Lucy, I thought you\\
329 - were going to have sales resistance
from now on.\\
330 - What happened?\\
331 - I don't know.\\
332 - Right after he took back the kitchen
helper,\\
333 - everything went black.\\
334 - Oh?\\
335 - When the lights came on again,\\
336 - I was short $102.40.\\
337 - $102.40 for just this?\\
338 - No. For a bonus, he threw in the
kitchen helper.\\
339 - That was nice of him.\\
340 - For a dollar and a half.\\
341 - What a salesman he must be!\\
342 - Yeah, but this is really a wonderful
machine\\
343 - and it just works beautifully.\\
344 - Turn on the switch and I'll show you.\\
345 - Okay.\\
346 - (whirring)\\
347 - What's this one for, Lucy?\\
348 - Lucy?\\
349 - (whirring stops)\\
350 - Try this one, Lucy.\\
351 - RICKY: Ay, yi, yi, yi...\\
352 - That's Ricky! That's Ricky!\\
353 - I don't want him to see this stuff.\\
354 - Help me hide it.\\
355 - Hide it?
Yeah.\\
356 - Oh.
He can't see this.\\
357 - Aren't you going to tell him you
bought all this?\\
358 - Someday, yes, when we're old and
grey, but not now.\\
359 - Where will I put it?\\
360 - In the closet.\\
361 - In the closet?\\
362 - Ay, yi, yi, yi\\
363 - Canta y no llores\\
364 - Porque cantando se alegran, cielito
lin...\\
365 - Hello.\\
366 - Oh, look. Here's Ricky.\\
367 - Hi, Ricky.\\
368 - Hello, Ricky.\\
369 - Good-bye, Ricky.\\
370 - (door closing)\\
371 - Well, she's in a hurry.\\
372 - Yeah.\\
373 - Oh, I'll hang it up for you, dear.\\
374 - Oh, thank you.\\
375 - What did you do today?\\
376 - Why do you ask that?\\
377 - I always ask that.\\
378 - Oh, yeah.\\
379 - That's right.\\
380 - Uh, nothing much.\\
381 - It's dark in here.\\
382 - Oh...\\
383 - (vacuum cleaner whirring)\\
384 - What's that?\\
385 - What's what?\\
386 - That.\\
387 - What?\\
388 - That.\\
389 - Oh, that. That's me.\\
390 - (imitating motor whirring)\\
391 - What?!\\
392 - My stomach's growling.\\
393 - It's been growling all day.\\
394 - (whirring)\\
395 - Now, Lucy, you know darn well\\
396 - you're not making that noise.\\
397 - It sounds like a vacuum cleaner.\\
398 - Where's it coming from?\\
399 - Oh, that sound.\\
400 - Oh, Ethel must be cleaning her rugs.\\
401 - All right, Ethel, break it up down
there!\\
402 - That's all.\\
403 - There. I guess she's finished.\\
404 - (whirring)\\
405 - Whoops. Not quite.\\
406 - Ricky?\\
407 - What?\\
408 - Kiss me?\\
409 - After I see what's at the end of this
cord.\\
410 - All right?\\
411 - You'd better kiss me now if you're
ever going to.\\
412 - (whirring stops)\\
413 - Lucy, what is this?\\
414 - Oh, darn. You found your Christmas
present.\\
415 - "The Handy Dandy vacuum cle... "\\
416 - Oh, no. Lucy, you didn't!\\
417 - Yeah, I sort of did, I guess.\\
418 - Okay, come on.\\
419 - Call the man.
Tell him to take it back.\\
420 - No.\\
421 - Come on.\\
422 - You'll be sorry.
Why?\\
423 - 'Cause he'll probably sell me\\
424 - a Handy Dandy bulldozer.\\
425 - Never mind.\\
426 - But Ricky, Ricky, really, he does
sell other things,\\
427 - and you know how I am.\\
428 - Yes. I know only too well.\\
429 - Now, look, you're going to call him
back\\
430 - and you're going to get rid of that
vacuum cleaner\\
431 - and you're going to get your money
back, understand?\\
432 - (piano keys banging)
Oh, yes.\\
433 - Lucy?\\
434 - I'm taking it back this afternoon!\\
435 - Oh...\\
436 - I thought you were Ricky.\\
437 - Oh. Are you really going to take it
back?\\
438 - Yeah. I was just having one last
sweep for the road.\\
439 - Oh, gee, Ethel, I don't dare call Mr.
Martin.\\
440 - I'm absolute putty in his hands.\\
441 - Obviously.\\
442 - Why did I buy that thing anyway?\\
443 - Why did you?\\
444 - I couldn't resist it.\\
445 - Hey... if I couldn't resist it\\
446 - maybe someone else won't be able to.\\
447 - You mean you're going try to sell it
to somebody else?\\
448 - Sure, I could sell it.\\
449 - I remember everything Mr. Martin said
and did.\\
450 - Don't look at me.\\
451 - Oh, I'm going to start on the next
block\\
452 - and I'm going to keep going until I
unload this monster.\\
453 - (door buzzer)\\
454 - Good afternoon, madam.\\
455 - Are you the lady of the house?\\
456 - Yeah.\\
457 - Hey! What are you doing?\\
458 - Madam, that ten-dollar bill, that
sawbuck,\\
459 - that one-tenth of a C-note is all
yours\\
460 - if my Handy Dandy vacuum cleaner\\
461 - fails to clean up that mess in two
minutes flat.\\
462 - You mean this ten dollars is mine if
you don't pick up\\
463 - all that dirt in two minutes flat?\\
464 - That's right.\\
465 - Let's see, now.\\
466 - Here we are.\\
467 - (clicking)\\
468 - That's funny.\\
469 - I can't imagine why it doesn't work.\\
470 - I can. The electricity is turned off.\\
471 - What?\\
472 - We didn't pay our bill.\\
473 - Oh, no.\\
474 - Why didn't you tell me?\\
475 - You didn't ask me.\\
476 - Oh, dear.\\
477 - I'm sorry I made such a mess on your
floor.\\
478 - I don't know how you're going to
clean it up.\\
479 - I do.\\
480 - Ew...\\
481 - Where can she be, Ethel?\\
482 - It's so late.\\
483 - I don't know.
Maybe she had to call\\
484 - on more houses than she thought she
would.\\
485 - Well, there's nothing to worry about.\\
486 - She's prob...
Shh! I hear somebody.\\
487 - Lucy!\\
488 - What happened?\\
489 - You'll be glad to know, Ricky,\\
490 - that there are plenty of women in
town\\
491 - with sales resistance.\\
492 - Couldn't you sell the vacuum cleaner?\\
493 - Oh, you poor little thing.\\
494 - Come on, honey, and sit down.\\
495 - Here. Sit there.\\
496 - I'll take your shoes off.\\
497 - That will help.\\
498 - Lucy, where's your other shoe?\\
499 - Stuck in the door at 310 East 69th
Street.\\
500 - Oh, dear.\\
501 - I was kicked downstairs, bitten by a
dog\\
502 - and chased three blocks by a
policeman\\
503 - that wanted to see my peddler's
license.\\
504 - One more hour, they'd have reported\\
505 - the death of another salesman.\\
506 - Now, honey, I'm sorry\\
507 - that you had to go through all of
that\\
508 - but you know it's your own fault.\\
509 - Why didn't you call Mr. Martin like I
told you to do?\\
510 - Oh, sure.\\
511 - Well, I'll call him.\\
512 - What's his number?\\
513 - It's right there on the pad.\\
514 - Okay.\\
515 - Oh, Fred, I don't know what these
women would do\\
516 - without us men getting them out\\
517 - of all these messes that they get
into.\\
518 - I don't either.\\
519 - Hello, Mr. Martin.\\
520 - This is Ricky Ricardo.\\
521 - Look. You sold my wife a vacuum
cleaner yesterday.\\
522 - Yes. That's right.\\
523 - Well, uh, we decided not to keep it
after all.\\
524 - So we'd like you to come back tonight\\
525 - and take it back.\\
526 - 8:00? Yes, that will be fine.\\
527 - Thank you very much. Good-bye.\\
528 - There. You see how simple it was?\\
529 - Ricky, you shouldn't have him come
over here.\\
530 - You don't know what he's like.\\
531 - He'll say that he'll take it back,\\
532 - but he'll sell you something else.\\
533 - Oh, nonsense.\\
534 - Well, I'm not going to be here.\\
535 - I'm going to a movie.\\
536 - Come on, Ethel, let's get out of
here.\\
537 - Okay.
I'm going to get cleaned up.\\
538 - Have you ever seen anything like
that?\\
539 - Never in my life.\\
540 - You take my advice.\\
541 - You put that vacuum cleaner out in
the hall,\\
542 - lock the door and sit here in the
dark.\\
543 - Hi.\\
544 - Oh, hi. How was the movie?\\
545 - Fine.\\
546 - Did, uh... Mr.
Martin get here?\\
547 - Yeah. He was here.\\
548 - Did he take back the vacuum cleaner?\\
549 - Of course he did.\\
550 - He had no trouble at all.\\
551 - Oh?\\
552 - As a matter of fact, he paid me a
great compliment.\\
553 - He said I was a man of great judgment
and real taste.\\
554 - (knowingly): Oh.\\
555 - And not only that, but he said he
didn't blame me in the least\\
556 - for not buying such an inferior
product.\\
557 - Uh-oh.\\
558 - What happened then?\\
559 - Nothing.\\
560 - Come on.\\
561 - Nothing.\\
562 - Come on.
Where is it?\\
563 - Ethel, guess what?\\
564 - We have a new Handy Dandy
refrigerator.\\
565 - Oh, Ricky, I'm glad\\
566 - you don't have any sales resistance
either.\\
567 - ETHEL: Aw, Lucy.\\
568 - You get all the breaks.\\
569 - Nobody could sell ol' Fred anything.\\
570 - Oh, no?\\
571 - Oh?\\
572 - Fred?\\
573 - Come on down and see\\
574 - your Handy Dandy washing machine.\\

\subsection {Episode 18: The Inferiority Complex}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Hi, Rick.\\
3 - Oh, hiya, Fred.\\
4 - What's all this stuff?\\
5 - Well, it's some presents I bought for
Lucy.\\
6 - I'm going to take them down to the
hospital this afternoon.\\
7 - Oh.\\
8 - See, that's a box of her favorite
candy,\\
9 - her favorite perfume\\
10 - and how do you like this, huh?\\
11 - Oh, pretty fancy.\\
12 - Yeah, I want her to feel that she's
getting\\
13 - a lot of attention.\\
14 - Hey, tell me something.\\
15 - If you just had a baby,\\
16 - you think this would do the trick?\\
17 - Well, if I just had a baby,\\
18 - I'd be getting plenty of attention.\\
19 - I mean if you were a woman.\\
20 - Oh, if I were a woman.\\
21 - Oh, I guess so.\\
22 - Let's see.\\
23 - You think it clashes with my hair?\\
24 - Oh, nurse.\\
25 - Hi, Ricky.
Is Fred...?\\
26 - Oh, there you are, nurse.\\
27 - Tell me, do you think they'll
operate?\\
28 - Yes-- on your brain, from the look of
things.\\
29 - ETHEL: What are you doing?\\
30 - He's modeling Lucy's new bed jacket.\\
31 - Give me that.\\
32 - Oh. Are all these things for Lucy?\\
33 - Yes. I'm going to take it\\
34 - down to the hospital this afternoon.\\
35 - She feels kind of depressed.\\
36 - Depressed? Why?\\
37 - Well, last week, one of the women had
triplets,\\
38 - and this week, another lady had
twins,\\
39 - so Lucy feels that she's shortchanged
me.\\
40 - (both laughing)\\
41 - Listen, don't laugh.\\
42 - Oh, yeah. We don't want that to
happen again.\\
43 - I should say not.\\
44 - Do you remember how that started?\\
45 - No warning.\\
46 - Out of the blue she had a
full-fledged complex.\\
47 - We were just sitting around telling
each other stories...\\
48 - That was wonderful.\\
49 - I loved it.\\
50 - Listen, listen, did you hear the
story\\
51 - about that fellow that used to take
his dog\\
52 - to the movie with him all the time?\\
53 - No.
No.\\
54 - Well, this fellow used to take the
dog to the movie with him\\
55 - all the time, and they sit together,\\
56 - and the dog sit there and he laughs
at the all jokes\\
57 - and he applauds and everything.\\
58 - So, the manager of the theater saw
this.\\
59 - He walks down to this guy and says,\\
60 - "Do you mind telling me something?\\
61 - Does this dog actually enjoy the
picture?"\\
62 - And the guy says, "Yeah.
I can't understand it, either.\\
63 - He hated the book."\\
64 - (all laughing)\\
65 - The dog read the book.\\
66 - I got it, I got it.\\
67 - Oh, Ricky, that's wonderful.\\
68 - Want some candy, dear?\\
69 - Candy, Fred?\\
70 - No, thanks.\\
71 - He's on a diet.\\
72 - Since when?\\
73 - Since now.\\
74 - Oh.\\
75 - Hey, talking about diets,\\
76 - Did you hear the one about the fat
fella\\
77 - that wandered into the ladies'
Turkish bath by mistake...\\
78 - Fred, is this a story for mixed
company?\\
79 - Of course not.\\
80 - And he asks about the fat fella that
walked into...\\
81 - Fred.\\
82 - Ethel, this company isn't mixed.\\
83 - It's married.\\
84 - I don't care.\\
85 - It doesn't sound like the kind of
story he should tell\\
86 - when there are ladies present.\\
87 - It isn't.\\
88 - It's about the fat guy that str...\\
89 - Fred...\\
90 - All right, I won't tell it.\\
91 - Oh, darn. That's one story I hadn't
heard.\\
92 - Oh, well, don't be too unhappy.
Ricky.\\
93 - I know a joke.\\
94 - You?\\
95 - Yeah, and it's fit for mixed company,
too.\\
96 - Well, tell it anyway.\\
97 - Well, it seems that this woman walked
into a restaurant...\\
98 - Or no, wait a minute.\\
99 - Was it a woman that walked into a
restaurant,\\
100 - or was it a man?\\
101 - Does it make any difference to the
story?\\
102 - No.\\
103 - Well, it made a difference in my
story.\\
104 - (laughs)\\
105 - Okay, Fred.\\
106 - Aw, we'll say it was a woman.\\
107 - This woman walked into the
restaurant, and, uh...\\
108 - And-and-and...\\
109 - or was it a cafeteria?\\
110 - Honey, it doesn't matter.\\
111 - Get on with the story.\\
112 - Oh, we'll say it was a restaurant.\\
113 - This woman walked in to the
restaurant and sat down.\\
114 - Or did she stand up?\\
115 - Well, she could...\\
116 - Fred, you're mixing me all up.\\
117 - ETHEL: Let her finish.\\
118 - Um... this woman walked into a
restaurant and sat down\\
119 - and she ordered a steak from the
waiter.\\
120 - And she said...\\
121 - No, honey, no, no.\\
122 - I know that story, and it wasn't a
steak.\\
123 - It wasn't?
No.\\
124 - Oh, it was roast beef!\\
125 - No, no, honey.
What was it?\\
126 - Pork chops.\\
127 - Oh, yes. Pork chops.\\
128 - And she said, "I'd like two pork
chops."\\
129 - Oh...\\
130 - Go on, honey, go on.\\
131 - Well, now that I think of it, this
story isn't very funny.\\
132 - Well, it's a scream so far.\\
133 - Oh, keep quiet, Fred.\\
134 - Go on, honey.\\
135 - You really want to hear it?\\
136 - Of course we do.\\
137 - Sure, sure, go on.\\
138 - I just can't wait till you get to the
punch line.\\
139 - The punch line?\\
140 - The finish, honey, the finish.\\
141 - It has a finish, hasn't it?\\
142 - Well, I think so.\\
143 - I just can't remember how it goes.\\
144 - Oh...\\
145 - Oh, I remember! I remember.\\
146 - The woman walked into a restaurant
and sat down,\\
147 - and she said to the waiter,\\
148 - "I'd like two pork chops, please."\\
149 - And the waiter said, "Yes, ma'am."\\
150 - And she said, "And not too much fat,
either."\\
151 - And the waiter said, "Yes, ma'am.
Which way?"\\
152 - (Lucy laughing)\\
153 - Well?\\
154 - Is that all there is to it?\\
155 - Yeah. Pretty funny, huh?\\
156 - (laughs heartily)\\
157 - Huh?\\
158 - No?\\
159 - I don't get it.\\
160 - Oh, Ethel, you have no sense of
humor.\\
161 - She has, too.
You told it wrong.\\
162 - The woman said to the waiter,\\
163 - "Two pork chops, and make them lean."\\
164 - And the waiter said, "Yes, ma'am.
Which way?"\\
165 - Oh.\\
166 - (laughing)\\
167 - Well, isn't that what I said?\\
168 - No.\\
169 - Well, either way, it's hardly a belly
laugh.\\
170 - Oh, yeah, make them lean.\\
171 - I forgot that little part.\\
172 - Little part?\\
173 - Oh, Lucy, you haven't told a story
right\\
174 - for your whole life.\\
175 - Well!\\
176 - I'm sorry I'm not Milton Berle.\\
177 - Oh, honey, I didn't mean it that way.\\
178 - You don't have to get your feelings
hurt.\\
179 - No, I've known worse storytellers
than you.\\
180 - Thanks a lot.\\
181 - Oh, Fred, you and Ricky quit picking
on Lucy.\\
182 - After all, she can't help it\\
183 - if she's a lousy joke teller.\\
184 - Well, I can't thank you all enough.\\
185 - You can just sit here\\
186 - and tell yourselves hilarious jokes.\\
187 - I'm going to bed.\\
188 - Oh, now, honey, wait a minute. Honey!\\
189 - You don't have to cry about it.\\
190 - Uh, no. Who cares about telling
stories?\\
191 - Let's all play bridge, huh?\\
192 - Yeah, yeah.\\
193 - That's a good... Huh?\\
194 - Oh, yeah, yeah.\\
195 - We haven't played bridge in a long
time.\\
196 - Yeah, that's a wonderful idea, isn't
it, Lucy?\\
197 - Lucy?\\
198 - Well...\\
199 - Oh, good, come on.\\
200 - ETHEL: Let's get it set up.\\
201 - FRED: All right.\\
202 - That's a girl.\\
203 - Here we go. Come on, now.\\
204 - I got the table.\\
205 - Can I help you with that, Rick?\\
206 - Yeah, it's a new one, see?\\
207 - Oh!
Oh, look at that.\\
208 - Well, you don't need any help.\\
209 - ETHEL: Oh, boy!\\
210 - There you go.\\
211 - Rick, you sit over there.\\
212 - I'd like to have Ethel as my partner\\
213 - for a change tonight.\\
214 - No, Ethel is always my partner.\\
215 - Yeah. Why does she always have to be
your partner, Fred?\\
216 - Well, I'll flip you to see who gets
her.\\
217 - All right.\\
218 - That won't be necessary.\\
219 - It's pretty obvious\\
220 - that no one wants me for a partner.\\
221 - Now, honey, wait a minute.
Where are you going?\\
222 - I'm going in the bedroom and tell
myself funny stories\\
223 - and play solitaire.\\
224 - Morning, honey.\\
225 - Good morning, dear.\\
226 - Here you are.\\
227 - Thank you.\\
228 - Ricky, I've been thinking about last
night.\\
229 - Yes, honey?\\
230 - And you know something?\\
231 - I'm not very bright.\\
232 - I-I don't do things well.\\
233 - Well, honey, that's not true.\\
234 - You're the most wonderful, the
cleverest\\
235 - and the most fascinating woman I've
ever met.\\
236 - And I love you very much.\\
237 - Really?\\
238 - Of course I do.\\
239 - Here's to the greatest little wife in
the whole world.\\
240 - Oh...\\
241 - (choking)\\
242 - What's the matter, dear?\\
243 - What's wrong with the orange juice?\\
244 - It's full of seeds.\\
245 - Oh, I forgot to strain it.\\
246 - I'm sorry.\\
247 - Oh, that's all right, honey.\\
248 - Oh...\\
249 - Oh, boy, these eggs look great. Mm!\\
250 - (gagging)\\
251 - What's the matter?\\
252 - Nothing...
nothing, dear, nothing.\\
253 - Oh, I salted them twice.\\
254 - I know I did.\\
255 - I couldn't remember and I did it
again.\\
256 - Oh, what's the matter with me?\\
257 - Oh, honey, they're fine.\\
258 - It's just, well, you know,\\
259 - I don't have a taste for eggs this
morning.\\
260 - I tell you what-- I'll have some
toast and coffee.\\
261 - Toast!\\
262 - (scraping)\\
263 - Honey, why didn't you use the
toaster?\\
264 - Well, it's being fixed.\\
265 - I accidentally knocked it off the
counter and broke it.\\
266 - Oh.
This will be all right.\\
267 - I'm just scraping off the burnt part.\\
268 - Sure, honey, sure.\\
269 - There.\\
270 - Oh, well, that's, that's all right,
honey.\\
271 - I'll eat something downtown.\\
272 - Good-bye.\\
273 - (wailing)\\
274 - Lucy, what's the matter, honey?\\
275 - I've done it again.\\
276 - Chalk up another boo-boo.\\
277 - Now, honey.\\
278 - We might as well face it, Ricky.\\
279 - I'm a big, fat flop.\\
280 - Well, you are not.\\
281 - I am, too.\\
282 - I can't tell jokes.\\
283 - I can't play bridge.\\
284 - I can't get breakfast.\\
285 - I can't do anything.\\
286 - Oh, now, sweetheart, that's not true.\\
287 - You can do a lot of things.\\
288 - Name one.\\
289 - Well, honey, you are very good at,
uh...\\
290 - Well, you're wonderful at, uh...\\
291 - (wailing)\\
292 - Now, what are you crying about?\\
293 - I can't think of anything either.\\
294 - Now, honey, you stop talking that
way.\\
295 - You're getting an inferiority
complex.\\
296 - No, I'm not.\\
297 - Well, it sounds like it.\\
298 - No, I'm not.
I don't need a complex.\\
299 - I really am inferior.\\
300 - Oh, honey.\\
301 - Lucy?\\
302 - Hi, Ethel.\\
303 - Hey, why are you in bed\\
304 - in the middle of the day?\\
305 - Why not?\\
306 - Lucy, what's the matter with you?\\
307 - Ethel, I'm no good.\\
308 - I'm a failure.\\
309 - Now, whatever made you say a thing
like that?\\
310 - You all told me so last night, and
you were right.\\
311 - Oh, we didn't mean it that way.\\
312 - Why, you're a very clever person.\\
313 - You can do a lot of things.\\
314 - Such as?\\
315 - Well, you're just wonderful at...
Um...\\
316 - Well, you've always been tops, uh...\\
317 - Those are the same ones Ricky thought
of.\\
318 - Oh, now, wait a minute.\\
319 - I know one thing you do better\\
320 - than anybody in the whole world.\\
321 - What?\\
322 - There's nobody can get her hair the
color you can.\\
323 - Thank you.\\
324 - That didn't come out\\
325 - the way I wanted it to.\\
326 - Neither did my hair.\\
327 - Oh, come on.\\
328 - Get out of that bed and get dressed.\\
329 - No.\\
330 - Lucy, come on and get up.\\
331 - This isn't getting you anywhere.\\
332 - Ethel, I've been where I'm going.\\
333 - Hi, Ethel.\\
334 - Hi.\\
335 - Lucy, are you still in bed?\\
336 - Hi, Ricky.\\
337 - I thought we settled this on the
phone.\\
338 - I thought you were going to get up.\\
339 - Well, I was going to, and then I
asked myself why.\\
340 - There I had me.\\
341 - Now, come on, honey.
Come on.\\
342 - How about a kiss, huh?\\
343 - No.\\
344 - Why not?\\
345 - You wouldn't like it.\\
346 - Well, honey, you...
you rest for a little bit\\
347 - and I'll come back and see you later.\\
348 - Good-bye.\\
349 - I'm worried about her.\\
350 - I'm very worried about her.\\
351 - She's got the worst inferiority
complex\\
352 - I ever saw, the poor little thing.\\
353 - I know.\\
354 - I'm going to call a physio-chiatrist.\\
355 - A what?\\
356 - A physio-chiatrist.\\
357 - A head doctor.\\
358 - She's really sick.\\
359 - Physio-chiatrist.\\
360 - "F."\\
361 - Doctor, she's just given up
altogether.\\
362 - She won't even get out of bed.\\
363 - She doesn't think that she can do
anything at all.\\
364 - I see.\\
365 - Well, it's just too bad that all
those events\\
366 - happened together the other night\\
367 - and made her feel rejected.\\
368 - I'll tell you what I want you to do.\\
369 - Pay a lot of attention to her,
flatter her...\\
370 - Bring her flowers and candy.\\
371 - Yeah, I tried that.\\
372 - Last night I brought her a big,
beautiful bouquet of flowers\\
373 - and a big box of candy.\\
374 - What did she say?\\
375 - She said, "Now what have you done?"\\
376 - And she has decided that I'm in love
with somebody else.\\
377 - And the worst part of it is, she
doesn't blame me.\\
378 - Well, I don't suppose\\
379 - she'll believe she's attractive\\
380 - unless the attention\\
381 - comes from some outside source.\\
382 - Can you think of a tall, handsome,
charming man\\
383 - who might be willing to play along?\\
384 - No.\\
385 - What about this Fred Mertz\\
386 - you spoke of?\\
387 - Oh, no.\\
388 - Tall, handsome, charming man...\\
389 - No, I can't think of anyone like
that, doc.\\
390 - What am I going to do?\\
391 - Well, don't worry about it.\\
392 - I'll find someone for you.\\
393 - At, uh, 8:00 tonight,\\
394 - a tall, handsome, charming man will
appear at your apartment.\\
395 - You introduce him as an old friend.\\
396 - Call him... Chuck Stewart.\\
397 - Oh, gee, that's wonderful, doc.\\
398 - Thank you very much.\\
399 - It's all right.\\
400 - Thank you. Good-bye.\\
401 - Right.\\
402 - Why did you have me get my hair all
fixed up\\
403 - and sit out here tonight?\\
404 - Well, honey, I told you, a friend of
mine,\\
405 - an old friend of mine, Chuck Stewart,
is in town, see,\\
406 - and I asked him to come over tonight.\\
407 - I want him to meet you.\\
408 - Why? Is he a talent scout for a freak
show?\\
409 - Oh, now, Lucy...\\
410 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
411 - Hey, that must be him now.\\
412 - Chuck Stew...\\
413 - Hi, Ricky.\\
414 - Hello, Chuck.\\
415 - Come on in.\\
416 - Uh, Chuck...\\
417 - I want you to meet...\\
418 - No. This isn't your wife?\\
419 - Pretty awful, isn't it?\\
420 - Oh, Ricky, you told me she was
pretty,\\
421 - but I never expected to see such a
living doll!\\
422 - Eh... sit down.\\
423 - Won't you sit down, please?\\
424 - Oh, Ricky, you always got the breaks,\\
425 - but how you managed to marry\\
426 - this gorgeous dream, I...\\
427 - What eyes...\\
428 - what lips...\\
429 - what hair.\\
430 - Oh, but I just met you.\\
431 - I shouldn't be saying these things to
you, should I?\\
432 - No, but don't let that stop you.\\
433 - You know, when Ricky asked me to come
over this evening,\\
434 - I never expected to meet anything
like you.\\
435 - Oh?\\
436 - Uh, uh... Chuck, uh...\\
437 - how's the band business been to you?\\
438 - Fine.\\
439 - You heard anything from the gang yet?\\
440 - Nope.\\
441 - Oh, I can't believe\\
442 - those heavenly blue eyes.\\
443 - What do you say we all watch the
television?\\
444 - I'm not going to take my eyes off
this gorgeous creature.\\
445 - Uh, let's listen to the radio.\\
446 - (soft music playing)\\
447 - Ah, that music makes me feel like
dancing, huh?\\
448 - Yeah. it makes me feel like dancing,
too.\\
449 - Oh, you two go ahead.\\
450 - I'll watch.\\
451 - Aw, come on, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
452 - Now, just a minute, Chuck.\\
453 - Ricky, this is part of the treatment.\\
454 - What?\\
455 - Oh, that's musician talk.\\
456 - I asked Ricky if he knew what this
part of the beat meant.\\
457 - Oh.\\
458 - Let's keep things moving there.\\
459 - Am I holding you too tight?\\
460 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
461 - Treatment, Ricky, treatment.\\
462 - (music stops)\\
463 - Eh... I'm tired of dancing.\\
464 - Let's sit this one out, huh?\\
465 - The music has stopped!\\
466 - Oh, I know I shouldn't say this to
you,\\
467 - but you're glorious.\\
468 - Oh...\\
469 - You're ravishing.\\
470 - Oh...\\
471 - You're breathtaking!\\
472 - Ooh...\\
473 - Now, you cut that out.\\
474 - Treatment, Ricky, treatment.\\
475 - What do you know about treatment?\\
476 - Nothing, but every time he says it,\\
477 - you let him alone.\\
478 - Well, the treatment is all over with,
doctor.\\
479 - What?\\
480 - He's not an old friend of mine.\\
481 - He's a physio-chiatrist.\\
482 - What?\\
483 - I hired him to snap you out of your
inferiority complex,\\
484 - but I don't like the way he operates.\\
485 - Oh, now, Ricky, you don't
understand...\\
486 - Good night, doctor.
Come on.\\
487 - Will you let me explain, Mr. Ricardo?\\
488 - I understand. Don't worry.\\
489 - You're highly nervous.\\
490 - Never mind that stuff.\\
491 - You'll get my bill in the morning.\\
492 - Yeah. Good-bye.\\
493 - Ay-ay.\\
494 - Hey, um, I'm sorry I had to fool you
like that, honey,\\
495 - but, well, the main thing\\
496 - is that you're okay again.\\
497 - You are okay, aren't you?\\
498 - Lucy?\\
499 - (wailing)\\
500 - Honey...\\
501 - (footsteps approaching)\\
502 - Come on in.\\
503 - What's the matter?\\
504 - What'd you want us to come on up for?\\
505 - Oh, I'm telling you, I made a
terrible mistake\\
506 - with that doctor last night.\\
507 - She's even worse today.\\
508 - Worse?
Yeah.\\
509 - She hasn't talked all day.\\
510 - Oh, no.\\
511 - So, listen, I thought of an idea\\
512 - that can snap her out of it, you
know?\\
513 - You know, we actually were
responsible\\
514 - for making her get this inferiority
complex--\\
515 - telling her that she couldn't tell
jokes,\\
516 - that she couldn't play bridge, you
know?\\
517 - ETHEL: I guess you're right.\\
518 - So, I figure that if we tell her just
the opposite,\\
519 - we can cure her.\\
520 - You mean laugh like mad if she tells
a joke\\
521 - and fight over who's going to play
bridge with her?\\
522 - Yeah.\\
523 - Isn't there some less painful method?\\
524 - Come on.
Oh, come on, now, Fred.\\
525 - This is important.\\
526 - Yeah, this has got to work.\\
527 - Come on, will you.\\
528 - Lucy?\\
529 - Honey, come on out.\\
530 - We got company!\\
531 - Now, lay it on real thick, will you?\\
532 - You can count on us.\\
533 - Oh... Fred and Ethel.\\
534 - I guess you came up to see Ricky,
huh?\\
535 - I'll go back in the bedroom and sit
in the dark.\\
536 - Oh, no.\\
537 - Honey, the Mertzes came up to see
you.\\
538 - ETHEL: Of course we did!\\
539 - Oh?\\
540 - Come on, sweetheart.
Come on, sit down.\\
541 - Sit down, kids.\\
542 - Come on.\\
543 - How are you feeling, Lucy?\\
544 - Eh.\\
545 - Well, you're beginning to look like
your old self again.\\
546 - That's an awful thing to say to
anybody.\\
547 - Now, Lucy, don't go.\\
548 - If you leave, Ethel and I might as
well go back home.\\
549 - We came up to see you especially.\\
550 - Oh?\\
551 - Yes, we did.\\
552 - We were sitting downstairs after
supper\\
553 - and I said to Fred, "Fred, who do you
think\\
554 - I want to see tonight more than
anybody else in the world?"\\
555 - And Fred said...\\
556 - "Who?"\\
557 - ...and I said, "Lucy Ricardo, that's
who.\\
558 - "Lucy Ricardo, the greatest little
person\\
559 - in the whole wide world."\\
560 - And what did he say?\\
561 - "And what did he say"?\\
562 - (all three laughing hysterically)\\
563 - ETHEL: Isn't she a scream?\\
564 - FRED: That's a killer.\\
565 - (all laughing)\\
566 - Did I make a funny?\\
567 - Did she make a funny?\\
568 - (laughing harder)\\
569 - (laughing)\\
570 - Lucy, have you heard any good jokes
lately?\\
571 - Jokes? Oh, you know I don't tell
jokes very well, Ethel.\\
572 - Oh, honey, what are you talking
about?\\
573 - You're the greatest little
storyteller in the whole world.\\
574 - Since when?\\
575 - Well, you've always told stories
better than anybody I know.\\
576 - Really?\\
577 - Sure!\\
578 - Well, I do know one.\\
579 - Well, come on, tell us, Lucy.\\
580 - Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, go ahead.\\
581 - Well, it seems there were these two
fellows, Pat and Mike,\\
582 - and they were working together
building a house,\\
583 - and every time that Pat bent over to
pick up something,\\
584 - Mike kicked him.\\
585 - (laughing)\\
586 - I'm not finished yet.\\
587 - Oh.\\
588 - Anyway, Pat finally decided\\
589 - to put some dynamite in his back
pocket,\\
590 - and he said, "The next time Mike
kicks me,\\
591 - he'll blow his foot off."\\
592 - (all laughing)\\
593 - ETHEL: Oh, that's a real gem.\\
594 - That was a lollapalooza!\\
595 - What do you say we all...\\
596 - I know another one.\\
597 - Oh.\\
598 - Well, go ahead and tell it, honey. Go
ahead.\\
599 - Well, it seems\\
600 - there was this bashful little worm\\
601 - and he saw another worm and he fell
in love with it,\\
602 - and said, "Will you marry me?"\\
603 - And the other worm said,\\
604 - "Don't be silly.
This is my other end."\\
605 - That's all.\\
606 - That's all!\\
607 - (all laughing)\\
608 - Pretty good, huh?\\
609 - Pretty good?\\
610 - That was better than the first one!\\
611 - Oh, honey, I got to hand it to you.\\
612 - You're a great little storyteller.\\
613 - Really? Do you really think so?\\
614 - Yeah, honey.\\
615 - Well, let's all play bridge.\\
616 - Yeah!
That's a great idea.\\
617 - Oh, dear.\\
618 - RICKY: What's the matter, honey?\\
619 - Oh, now you'll all start arguing over
who has to play with me.\\
620 - Why, are you kidding?\\
621 - You are my partner and nobody else's.\\
622 - FRED: Now, that's not fair, Ricky.\\
623 - You get Lucy for a partner all the
time,\\
624 - and tonight I want her.\\
625 - No. Tonight it's men against women.\\
626 - Lucy, you're my partner.\\
627 - Oh, now I'm not going to argue with
you.\\
628 - No, no, no, no.
I want to play with Lucy.\\
629 - Aw, Ricky...\\
630 - Fellas, fellas, fellas, don't fight
over me.\\
631 - We can sort of take turns.\\
632 - You can sort of share me.\\
633 - Sort of share!
All right.\\
634 - All right, all right.\\
635 - Just so I can play with her a little
bit, that's all.\\
636 - Here we go.\\
637 - You got the chairs and stuff, Fred?\\
638 - Yeah.
All right.\\
639 - Gee, I feel so much better now.\\
640 - You liked my jokes\\
641 - and you want me for a bridge
partner--\\
642 - the next thing I know,\\
643 - you'll be asking me to sing.\\
644 - Don't you want to hear me sing?\\
645 - Sing?
Sure, honey.\\
646 - Do we?! Oh!\\
647 - Oh, come on, sing us a song, honey.\\
648 - (singing off-key)
Who stole my heart away?\\
649 - Who makes me dream all day?\\
650 - Dreams I know will...\\
651 - Oh, I feel so much better now.\\
652 - ...ever be blue\\
653 - Who means my happiness?\\
654 - He...\\

\subsection {Episode 19: The Club Election}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Hi, Ricky.\\
3 - Oh, hi, Ethel.\\
4 - Come in.\\
5 - Aw... hi, sweetie.\\
6 - Where's Lucy?\\
7 - She went out shopping.\\
8 - Do you know that this little
character\\
9 - has already outgrown his clothes?\\
10 - No kidding?\\
11 - Come on.\\
12 - Oh, isn't he a little doll?\\
13 - Hi.\\
14 - Hey, Ricky, he keeps looking at me
with one eye.\\
15 - Don't you wish he'd just stay like
this?\\
16 - Yeah.\\
17 - Anything special on your mind?\\
18 - Yeah, I came up to tell Lucy\\
19 - that the Wednesday Afternoon Fine
Arts League\\
20 - is meeting on Friday this week.\\
21 - The Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts
League\\
22 - is meeting on Friday.
Yeah.\\
23 - I thought you always met on Thursday.\\
24 - Oh, no, we never met on Thursday.\\
25 - We usually meet on Tuesday.\\
26 - Well, look, this is probably a very
stupid question\\
27 - but why couldn't the Wednesday
Afternoon Fine Arts League\\
28 - meet on Wednesday?\\
29 - Oh, we tried it, but nobody could
make it.\\
30 - Wednesday afternoon isn't a good day
for club meetings.\\
31 - That figures.\\
32 - Why don't you forget about the
meetings altogether?\\
33 - Oh, now, Ricky, don't pick on our
club.\\
34 - It's really a very worthwhile
organization.\\
35 - (fusses and burps)\\
36 - Nobody asked your opinion.\\
37 - He's going to grow up to be just like
you.\\
38 - (chuckling)\\
39 - Oh, I guess the club is all right,
Ethel,\\
40 - but, you know, if Lucy wouldn't get
so involved in it.\\
41 - Every time she gets into it, I get
into it, too.\\
42 - Oh, no.\\
43 - (cooing)\\
44 - You said it, kid.\\
45 - What do you mean, you said it?\\
46 - Don't you remember what happened on
the last nominations?\\
47 - Oh, that.\\
48 - Yes, that.\\
49 - Hey, Lucy, what's going on?\\
50 - Oh, my women's club is meeting here
today.\\
51 - Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.\\
52 - Why do they have to meet here all the
time?\\
53 - Oh, honey, they haven't met here for
three months.\\
54 - We're taking turns until we can
afford a clubhouse.\\
55 - Honey, you don't need a clubhouse.\\
56 - Why don't you meet on the back fence\\
57 - like other cats do?\\
58 - Never mind now.\\
59 - This is a very important meeting,
especially for me.\\
60 - We're nominating candidates for the
club election.\\
61 - I'll probably be nominated for every
office.\\
62 - I've acceptance speeches written for
all of them.\\
63 - Oh, you feel pretty sure of yourself,
huh?\\
64 - Well, honey, I know how the girls
feel about me, that's all.\\
65 - You think you're going to be elected
for some office, huh?\\
66 - Yeah, I'll be elected for something,
surely.\\
67 - Well, maybe I'll get a break and
they'll elect you nothing.\\
68 - Now, don't start on me about my
women's club.\\
69 - Okay, okay, I'll go spend the
afternoon with Fred.\\
70 - That's a good idea.\\
71 - Hi, Ricky.
Hi, Ethel.\\
72 - Hi, Ethel.\\
73 - Oh, Lucy, that's a beautiful sweater.\\
74 - Is it new?\\
75 - Yeah, you like it?\\
76 - It's gorgeous.\\
77 - Ooh, cashmere?\\
78 - Yeah, isn't that yummy?\\
79 - Mm-hmm.\\
80 - And look.\\
81 - A bag to match.\\
82 - Oh!
Isn't that the end?\\
83 - Of course, I won't be able to afford
another thing\\
84 - for three months, but who cares?\\
85 - Oh, dear, this terrible pitcher and
these cheap glasses.\\
86 - Say, listen, Ethel, you are going to
vote\\
87 - to admit Ruth Knickerbocker into the
club, aren't you?\\
88 - I don't know.\\
89 - Well, she'd be a wonderful addition
to the club.\\
90 - You think so?\\
91 - She seems sort of a quiet and mousey
type to me.\\
92 - Yeah, well, under that mousey
exterior\\
93 - beats a cut glass punch bowl and 20
cups.\\
94 - Oh...\\
95 - That's the kind of a woman we need in
our club.\\
96 - That's the way I feel about it.\\
97 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
98 - Oh, there they are, the thundering
herd.\\
99 - Lucy!\\
100 - Lillian! Hi!\\
101 - Hi, how are you?\\
102 - Ethel, how are you?\\
103 - Lucy, that sweater, it's stunning.\\
104 - Oh, thank you.\\
105 - Look.\\
106 - Oh, no, look at that bag to match.\\
107 - Oh, what an outfit!\\
108 - You know, I've been just dying for
one.\\
109 - Well, I got it...\\
110 - Don't tell me.\\
111 - I know how expensive they are, and I
just can't afford it.\\
112 - All right, I won't tell you.\\
113 - Oh, say, listen, before the others
get here,\\
114 - have you heard the dirt about Marion?\\
115 - Marion Strong?\\
116 - Yes!
What?\\
117 - Oh, let me tell you.\\
118 - You know how she's always trying to
pretend she's somebody?\\
119 - Oh, do I.\\
120 - Well, she finally got her
comeuppance.\\
121 - What happened?
She did?\\
122 - Well, let me tell you.\\
123 - I ran into her on the street the
other day,\\
124 - and she had on the most...\\
125 - Marion!
Marion!\\
126 - Oh, hi.\\
127 - (all exclaiming)\\
128 - Oh, I'm so glad to see you.\\
129 - (all talking at once)\\
130 - Lucy, you have new furniture.\\
131 - The whole thing is new.\\
132 - (pounding)\\
133 - Lucy, I got you a chair.\\
134 - We're all ready to start.\\
135 - Girls?\\
136 - Ladies, ladies.\\
137 - Shh.\\
138 - Ladies.\\
139 - The meeting will come to order.\\
140 - Now, we'll skip the minutes of the
last meeting\\
141 - and get right down to business.\\
142 - Madam President.\\
143 - Yes, Lillian.\\
144 - I would like to submit the name of
Ruth Knickerbocker\\
145 - for membership in our club.\\
146 - I think that's a wonderful idea.\\
147 - Very well.
You all had a chance\\
148 - to meet Ruth at our last meeting,\\
149 - so if there's no more discussion,
we'll vote.\\
150 - All those in favor of asking Ruth
Knickerbocker\\
151 - to join our club say aye.\\
152 - ALL: Aye.\\
153 - Noes?\\
154 - No noes.\\
155 - (all clamoring)\\
156 - (gavel pounding)\\
157 - Ruth Knickerbocker...\\
158 - (gavel pounding)\\
159 - Ruth Knickerbocker is now a member of
our club.\\
160 - And now, the election of officers.\\
161 - The chair will entertain nominations\\
162 - for the office of Treasurer.\\
163 - Yes. The chair recognizes Pauline
Lobos.\\
164 - Well, Madam President, I would like
to nominate for Treasurer\\
165 - one of our most conscientious
members.\\
166 - Now this girl really deserves an
office in our club.\\
167 - She's a wonderful person and a fine
character\\
168 - and a real leader--\\
169 - Grace Munson.\\
170 - (all exclaiming)\\
171 - Me?\\
172 - (all clamoring)\\
173 - Are there any more nominations?\\
174 - Oh, Grace, you'll make a wonderful
Treasurer.\\
175 - Of course, I wouldn't be Treasurer\\
176 - if they handed it to me on a silver
platter.\\
177 - You wouldn't?\\
178 - Terrible job.\\
179 - And now nominations are open for the
office of Secretary.\\
180 - The chair recognizes Marion Strong.\\
181 - I nominate a member who...\\
182 - well, she's just about the most
wonderful person.\\
183 - She's the loyalest person in the club\\
184 - and she's always ready to lend a hand\\
185 - when you ask her to.\\
186 - She's intelligent, pretty\\
187 - and one of the nicest persons you
could ever meet\\
188 - my very dear, dear friend,\\
189 - Lillian Appleby.\\
190 - Lillian!\\
191 - (all clamoring)\\
192 - Are there any more nominations?\\
193 - Oh, Lillian, you'll make a wonderful
Secretary.\\
194 - Secretary is really a very thankless
job, you know.\\
195 - Oh, is it?\\
196 - Very.\\
197 - Now, let me hear nominations for the
office of Vice President.\\
198 - Madam President.\\
199 - Chair recognizes Lillian Appleby.\\
200 - For the office of Vice President,\\
201 - I would like to nominate a girl who
really deserves the job.\\
202 - A girl who will fight for our club.\\
203 - You can tell that from the color of
her hair.\\
204 - My very dearest, dearest friend,\\
205 - Marion Strong.\\
206 - (Marion shrieking)\\
207 - Are there any more nominations for
Vice President?\\
208 - Oh, Marion, you'll make a wonderful
Vice President.\\
209 - Vice President's merely a figurehead,
you know.\\
210 - Oh, really?\\
211 - They work in name only.
Oh.\\
212 - And now we come\\
213 - to the most important office of all--\\
214 - the presidency.\\
215 - As far as I'm concerned there's only
one person\\
216 - who should follow me in the office of
President.\\
217 - She has administrative ability,\\
218 - she's charming, makes a good
appearance.\\
219 - In fact, she'll be a wonderful
President,\\
220 - and I'm so sure that you're all going
to elect her unanimously that I want
to be the first to shake the hand\\
221 - of our next president.\\
222 - Ethel Mertz!\\
223 - Ethel Mertz?\\
224 - Yes.\\
225 - (women exclaiming )
Oh, I don't...\\
226 - Please let us come to order now.\\
227 - Ladies. Ladies.\\
228 - I'm sure there will be no more
nominations for President.\\
229 - So I hereby declare the
nominations...\\
230 - Uh, Madam President.\\
231 - Yes, the chair recognizes Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
232 - I think that there should be\\
233 - some more nominations for presidency.\\
234 - Why, Lucy...\\
235 - Oh, it isn't that I don't feel\\
236 - that you'll make a wonderful
president, Ethel.\\
237 - It's just that I feel that the more
democratic way\\
238 - is to have more than one nominee.\\
239 - It doesn't matter who it is, just so
there are two.\\
240 - You understand.\\
241 - Well... yeah.\\
242 - Well, do I hear another nomination\\
243 - for President?\\
244 - Since there are no more nominations
for President,\\
245 - I hereby declare the nomina...\\
246 - Madam President.\\
247 - Yes, Lucy?\\
248 - I'd like time-out for a caucus.\\
249 - A-A-A what?\\
250 - A caucus.\\
251 - Didn't you watch the conventions on
television?\\
252 - Oh...\\
253 - Well...\\
254 - Well, very well, all right...
caucus.\\
255 - Come on, Lillian, let's caucus.\\
256 - You know, television has changed the
thinking\\
257 - of the entire world.\\
258 - She wouldn't have had sense enough to
caucus\\
259 - this time last year.\\
260 - (all clamoring)\\
261 - You look it up in the bylaws.\\
262 - Ethel, you ought to filibuster.\\
263 - Really, you should filibuster.\\
264 - Madam President.\\
265 - Yes, Lillian.\\
266 - I would like to nominate Lucy Ricardo
for President.\\
267 - Oh!\\
268 - Oh, well, I...\\
269 - Well, you see, I feel that if there
are two,\\
270 - it's the more American way of
doing...\\
271 - It's democratic, it's, uh...\\
272 - Well, how's the campaign coming,
Lucy, dear?\\
273 - Just fine, Ethel, honey.\\
274 - Just fine, sweetie.\\
275 - That's good.\\
276 - You know, running for the same office\\
277 - might bother some good friends, but
it doesn't bother me a bit.\\
278 - Well, it doesn't bother me either.\\
279 - I just feel it's all in the family.\\
280 - Sure, all in the family.\\
281 - That's the way I feel.\\
282 - Hey, you should see the cute campaign
poster\\
283 - that Lucy made.\\
284 - Oh, honey, don't bother to show them
that.\\
285 - No, let's see it.\\
286 - Oh, don't be silly.\\
287 - "Happy you will be with Lucy,\\
288 - cast your vote and wait till you
see."\\
289 - Oh!\\
290 - Oh, that's darling, honey.\\
291 - FRED: That's pretty good.\\
292 - They're sort of fun to make, you
know.\\
293 - Ethel wrote some good ones, too.\\
294 - Uh, Fred...\\
295 - LUCY: Oh?\\
296 - RICKY: What were they?\\
297 - Well, one of them said, uh...\\
298 - "You can go farther with Ethel."\\
299 - Oh!\\
300 - Oh, that's just darling.\\
301 - That's like that gasoline ad.
Yeah.\\
302 - Hey, here's another one.\\
303 - Oh, never mind, Ricky, never mind.\\
304 - That's enough, dear.\\
305 - Oh, this is a beaut.\\
306 - "Nertz to Mertz"?\\
307 - It's a joke, dear.\\
308 - Oh, a joke.\\
309 - It's very amusing.\\
310 - Oh, boy, and you were worried\\
311 - about that one you wrote about her.\\
312 - Now, Fred...\\
313 - Uh, Fred...\\
314 - What was it?\\
315 - "A vote for the redhead is a vote for
a deadhead."\\
316 - And then she put underneath...\\
317 - Uh, never mind, never mind.\\
318 - Come on, let's play cards.\\
319 - Oh, wait a minute.
Just a minute.\\
320 - Uh, Fred, what was it that was
underneath?\\
321 - Well, underneath "deadhead" she wrote\\
322 - "or should I say dyedhead."\\
323 - Well, that's a fine thing to say.\\
324 - Well, "Nertz to Mertz" isn't exactly
a bouquet of roses.\\
325 - Now, wait a minute, hold it
candidates.\\
326 - Don't lose your tempers.\\
327 - Nobody's losing her temper.\\
328 - It's just good to know what I'm
running against, that's all.\\
329 - Well, the same goes for me.\\
330 - I might have known you'd resort to
mudslinging.\\
331 - And I might have known you would
conduct a smear campaign.\\
332 - Smear campaign?
Give me that thing.\\
333 - I'll show you what a real smear
campaign is.\\
334 - This isn't nearly strong enough.\\
335 - Well, if that's the way you want to
play,\\
336 - I've got some ideas of my own.\\
337 - Come on, Fred.\\
338 - Well, that's perfectly all right with
me.\\
339 - You can play anyway that you want,
and see if I care.\\
340 - Okay! I'm going to do that poster I
decided not to do.\\
341 - You mean, "With our club's welfare do
not tinker.\\
342 - Lucy Ricardo's a dirty..."\\
343 - That's the one.\\
344 - That's going to be tame\\
345 - next to the ones that I'm going to
write!\\
346 - I see. I see. Uh-huh.\\
347 - Well, it was nice talking with you,
Marion. Mm-hmm.\\
348 - No, no, no, I didn't call for
anything special.\\
349 - Uh, by the way, who do you think\\
350 - is going to be our next club
president?\\
351 - Lucy or Ethel?\\
352 - Oh.\\
353 - Oh!\\
354 - Oh...\\
355 - Well, if that's the way it is,\\
356 - then that's the way it's got to be.\\
357 - A divorce will be the best thing for
her.\\
358 - Uh-huh.\\
359 - Well, I'll see you next week\\
360 - at the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts
Club.\\
361 - Who did you say you were going to
vote for?\\
362 - Oh, good choice, good choice. Bye.\\
363 - She's voting for Ethel.\\
364 - Ethel?\\
365 - What was all that "good choice, good
choice" for?\\
366 - Well, that was to throw her off the
scent\\
367 - so she wouldn't know what we were
doing.\\
368 - Fine thing.
Ethel and I are tied.\\
369 - Half the club's voting for Ethel,\\
370 - half the club's voting for me.\\
371 - Oh. Well, we haven't heard from Ruth
Knickerbocker yet.\\
372 - She wasn't home.\\
373 - Oh, dear, how do you like that?\\
374 - She's only been in the club a week\\
375 - and she's going to decide who the
next president is.\\
376 - I think I'm going to have to put\\
377 - a little friendly pressure on Ruth
Knickerbocker this week.\\
378 - Well, Lucy, dear, I really must be
going now.\\
379 - Well, it was certainly nice of you\\
380 - to come over this afternoon, Lillian.\\
381 - You know, Lucy, I'm a little ashamed\\
382 - at what I've done for you this
afternoon.\\
383 - Oh...
You know, I really shouldn't have.\\
384 - Well, I certainly appreciate it.\\
385 - You know that, Lillian.\\
386 - I sure do, dear.\\
387 - Thanks very much.\\
388 - Well, Lucy, really, I do have to go
now.\\
389 - Yes?\\
390 - Oh!\\
391 - Bye, Lucy.\\
392 - Good-bye.\\
393 - Hi, Rick.\\
394 - Hi, Fred.\\
395 - Want to join me?\\
396 - No, thanks.\\
397 - That's the same thing I had for
dinner.\\
398 - Where's Lucy?\\
399 - Oh, I don't know.\\
400 - Ever since this club election
started,\\
401 - she's never home.\\
402 - She's out campaigning.\\
403 - Yeah, Ethel, too.\\
404 - She's rushing that new member right
off her feet.\\
405 - You mean Ruth Knickerbocker?\\
406 - Yeah. Hers is the deciding vote, you
know?\\
407 - Ethel's had her to tea,\\
408 - then to dinner, and a couple of
movies.\\
409 - (chuckling)\\
410 - That's funny.\\
411 - Lucy had her out to lunch twice,\\
412 - and last night she took her to dinner
and to the theater.\\
413 - Mm-hmm. That kid's being pulled apart\\
414 - like the last girdle at a bargain
sale.\\
415 - Well, I hope she votes for Ethel.\\
416 - Well, I don't.\\
417 - Just think how involved my life will
be\\
418 - if Ethel is president of that club.\\
419 - Listen, you just think how involved
my life is\\
420 - with Lucy just being Lucy.\\
421 - Yeah, you got a point there.\\
422 - Yeah.\\
423 - Boy, she's not going to be elected\\
424 - president of that club if I can help
it.\\
425 - Well, there's nothing much\\
426 - we can do about it, except pray.\\
427 - Well, I don't know.\\
428 - There must be something that we can
do.\\
429 - If there was only some way\\
430 - that I could sway the Knickerbocker
vote.\\
431 - Then I could...\\
432 - See you later, Lucy!
Hey, Fred!\\
433 - Good-bye, Fred. Adios.\\
434 - Ethel will be home any minute.\\
435 - Yeah, so long, Fred.\\
436 - So long.
Good-bye.\\
437 - Good-bye\\
438 - Knickerbocker, Knickerbocker,
Knickerbock...\\
439 - Knickerbock..?\\
440 - Hello, information?\\
441 - I'd like to have\\
442 - Ruth Knickerbocker's phone number,
please.\\
443 - Knickerbocker.\\
444 - Listen, if I knew how to spell it\\
445 - I wouldn't have to call information.\\
446 - Knickerbocker, I don't know.\\
447 - N-i-k-e-r-b-o-k-e-r.\\
448 - Yeah.\\
449 - There's nobody by that name?\\
450 - Look again, will you?\\
451 - Yeah, yeah, that's it. That's it.\\
452 - With a "K"?\\
453 - Well, give me the number.\\
454 - Thank you.\\
455 - With a "K"?\\
456 - Wonder why they put a "K" in front...\\
457 - Hello, Miss K-nickerbocker?\\
458 - This is Ricky Ricardo.\\
459 - Lucy's husband, you know.\\
460 - Yeah, well, you know, I have a club,
you know, the Tropicana,\\
461 - and I sing and they have the band
down there and everything.\\
462 - So I just thought that maybe you'd
like to come down tonight\\
463 - and have some dinner and see the
show...\\
464 - Oh?\\
465 - Oh, you're busy tonight.\\
466 - Oh, I see.\\
467 - You have a date with Freddie Mertz?\\
468 - Oh, oh, all right.\\
469 - Well, good-bye.\\
470 - I didn't know he could run that fast.\\
471 - (soft big band music playing)\\
472 - "Cuban Cabby."\\
473 - (samba playing)\\
474 - (clicking tongue to music)\\
475 - My horse and carriage is for hire,
seÃ±ora\\
476 - For just as long as you desire,
seÃ±orita\\
477 - You want to ride\\
478 - Forget the maÃ±ana\\
479 - And come to Havana with me\\
480 - I'm the Cuban cabby\\
481 - I'm the Cuban cabby\\
482 - The taxi drivers drive you frantic,
you know\\
483 - Oh, but my rig is more romantic, and
so\\
484 - You want to ride\\
485 - A night full of splendor\\
486 - And you can depend upon me\\
487 - I'm the Cuban cabby\\
488 - And I need dinero\\
489 - Money, that is.\\
490 - Broke, huh?\\
491 - Hey...\\
492 - The moon is peeping\\
493 - The shadow's creeping\\
494 - It's time for riding through the park\\
495 - A lovely night for lovers\\
496 - The same as you two are\\
497 - If you like music\\
498 - I'll give you music\\
499 - As we go riding in the dark\\
500 - I'll sing a Spanish love song\\
501 - To the strains of my guitar\\
502 - Ese lunar que tienes, cielito lindo\\
503 - Junto a la boca\\
504 - No se lo des a nadie, cielito lindo\\
505 - Que ami me toca\\
506 - Ay-ay-ay-ay\\
507 - Canta y no llores\\
508 - Porque cantando se alegran\\
509 - Cielito lindo, los corazones\\
510 - Ay-ay-ay-ay\\
511 - Canta y no llores\\
512 - Porque cantando se alegran\\
513 - Cielito lindo, los corazones.\\
514 - Ole!\\

seÃ±ora\\
517 - For just as long as you desire,
seÃ±orita\\
518 - We're gonna ride\\
519 - We're gonna ride\\
520 - We're gonna ride.\\
521 - (applause)\\
522 - Miss Knickerbocker, I've been wanting
to...\\
523 - Uh, just a minute, Ricky.\\
524 - Fred, please, we're talking.\\
525 - Please, don't bother us.\\
526 - Hi, fellas.\\
527 - We came down to the club to
celebrate.
Celebrate?\\
528 - Yeah, the club elections were
tonight.\\
529 - Yeah, and we both won-- it was a tie.\\
530 - We are co-presidents.\\
531 - RICKY: What, what, what?\\
532 - How can it be a tie?\\
533 - How about Ruth Knickerbocker's vote?\\
534 - Oh, she wasn't there.\\
535 - She's home sick in bed from all the
rich food\\
536 - that Ethel and I fed her all week.\\
537 - What do you mean she's home sick in
bed?\\
538 - She's sitting right here.\\
539 - Oh, hello, Mrs.
Knickerbocker.\\
540 - Oh, that isn't Ruth Knickerbocker.\\
541 - She isn't?\\
542 - No.\\
543 - You're not?\\
544 - No.\\
545 - That's Ruth's mother-in-law.\\
546 - Why didn't you tell us?\\
547 - I didn't want to spoil the fun.\\
548 - At my age, you don't get too many
chances.\\

1 - (I Love Lucy theme song playing)\\
2 - Ricky!\\
3 - Lucy!\\
4 - Ow!\\
5 - What are you trying to do, kill me?\\
6 - Well, what are you doing\\
7 - sneaking around behind the door?\\
8 - Hey, hey, hey.
Don't make so much noise.\\
9 - What's going on?\\
10 - You're going to wake up the kid.\\
11 - She slammed the door on my nose.\\
12 - I did not.
He walked right into it.\\
13 - You okay now, Fred?\\
14 - I wouldn't be surprised if it's
broken.\\
15 - I may never smell again.\\
16 - You want to bet?\\
17 - Oh, go on, make jokes.\\
18 - You probably knew I was behind the
door.\\
19 - I did not.\\
20 - Anyway, I don't see\\
21 - how the door got near your nose\\
22 - with that big stomach bumper you've
got.\\
23 - I just hope you haven't marred\\
24 - this classic profile, that's all.\\
25 - ETHEL: Oh, brother.\\
26 - RICKY (chuckling): Let me see, Fred.\\
27 - Hey, you got quite a bump.\\
28 - I wouldn't be surprised if that eye
turns black.\\
29 - Yeah?\\
30 - Now you see what you've done.\\
31 - Here I am with a black eye\\
32 - and I got to go to a lodge meeting
tonight.\\
33 - Well, you got a perfect excuse.\\
34 - You're probably the only person in
history\\
35 - who ever really got a black eye\\
36 - by walking into a door.\\
37 - But they'll never believe that.\\
38 - Why not?
It's the truth.\\
39 - No, that doesn't matter.\\
40 - Nobody ever believes the real story
of a black eye.\\
41 - I don't see why not.\\
42 - When?\\
43 - Oh, I did too believe you.\\
44 - You did not.\\
45 - I did, too.\\
46 - You certainly had a funny way of
showing it.\\
47 - I'll never forget how surprised I was\\
48 - by your attitude.\\
49 - Lucy and I were just sitting at home\\
50 - minding our own business.\\
51 - She was reading a book, and I walked
into the room\\
52 - and that's when the whole thing
started.\\
53 - Hey, honey, you seen the book I was
reading?\\
54 - I thought I left it on that table
there.\\
55 - What could I have done with my book?\\
56 - Hey, that's my book.\\
57 - Hey, what are you doing?!\\
58 - Well, that's the book I was reading.\\
59 - I was reading it last night.\\
60 - Well, I'm reading it tonight.\\
61 - Now, Lucy, be fair.\\
62 - The book belongs to the person who
started it first.\\
63 - It does not.
There's a new rule:\\
64 - readers keepers, losers go look at
television.\\
65 - That rule does not apply to Cubans.\\
66 - Now, Ricky, come on.\\
67 - Come on, now, give me the book!\\
68 - Oh, this is getting us nowhere.\\
69 - Come on, we'll read it together.\\
70 - Oh, all right.\\
71 - (sighs)\\
72 - Can you see all right to read?\\
73 - Sure.\\
74 - "Madge went into the darkened room\\
75 - and there she saw..." Lucy's thumb.\\
76 - Oh.\\
77 - Sorry. How's that?\\
78 - That's fine.\\
79 - (to herself): "Gordon plunged a knife
into her back several times.\\
80 - "She tried desperately to fight back.\\
81 - "But the blood, oozing from her many
wounds,\\
82 - "poured about her feet as she slipped
to the ground\\
83 - "taking the lamp, electrocuting
herself.\\
84 - Nothing but a pile of ashes was
left."\\
85 - Are you ready to turn the page?\\
86 - No, I'm not ready to turn the page.\\
87 - You were mumbling so loud\\
88 - I wasn't able to concentrate.\\
89 - I haven't read a word yet.\\
90 - Oh, well, there's nothing on that
page anyway.\\
91 - Madge tried to poison Gordon, Gordon
found out about it\\
92 - and he tried to run her over with his
car.\\
93 - That's all. Next page.\\
94 - "Gordon left the house...
dismembering the housekeeper"?\\
95 - Ew!\\
96 - "Disposing of her body in the garbage
disposal..."\\
97 - Honey, will you please stop mumbling?\\
98 - Well, I'm just reading.\\
99 - Well, honey, can you read with your
mouth close?\\
100 - Okay.\\
101 - (muffled mumbling)\\
102 - Oh, no, no, no, this won't work.\\
103 - No, no, I can't read that way. No.\\
104 - I can't read that way!\\
105 - How about one of us reading out loud
to the other?\\
106 - All right.\\
107 - Okay.\\
108 - Well, go ahead.\\
109 - "Madge se levantÃ³ de la carretera\\
110 - "y fue donde estaba...\\
111 - "cuando llegÃ³ ahÃ­ with the car,
Gordon le dijo:\\
112 - "'Madge, ven acÃ¡,' y le dio asÃ­ en
la cara\\

114 - "Y entonces la pobre muchacha tenÃ­a
blood all over the place\\
115 - "y le dijo 'iNo, no me des mÃ¡s, no
me des mÃ¡s!\\
116 - Perdona, Gordon, ino, no me des
mÃ¡s!'"\\
117 - When I read, I translate into Spanish\\
118 - as I go along.\\
119 - Yeah.\\
120 - "Madge got up from the road\\
121 - "after Gordon had run her over with
the car\\
122 - "and ran to him.\\
123 - "She was beaten and torn.\\
124 - "Her clothes were in shreds\\
125 - "And blood poured from her many
wounds.\\
126 - "Their eyes met.\\
127 - "Then in a feeble voice, Madge said,\\
128 - "'You don't like me, do you?'"\\
129 - "Suddenly, she gathered strength.\\
130 - "'Go ahead, admit it,' she shouted\\
131 - 'You hate me!'"\\
132 - Honey...\\
133 - "You hate me, don't you?
Lucy.\\
134 - Don't you?!" You don't have to shout!\\
135 - Honey, you don't have to shout.\\
136 - I can't help it!\\
137 - (softer): I can't help it.\\
138 - I get carried away with this stuff.\\
139 - All right, go ahead.\\
140 - But try to control yourself.\\
141 - Okay.\\
142 - "Gordon couldn't stand it any longer.\\
143 - "He screamed at her, 'Okay, Madge,
you asked for it.'\\
144 - "He started slowly toward her.\\
145 - "Madge's eyes showed terror.\\
146 - "He came closer, closer...\\
147 - closer..."\\
148 - Wait a minute, Fred.\\
149 - Don't just walk in.
Ring the bell.\\
150 - Well, we always just walk in.\\
151 - Yeah, I know, but they don't know
we're coming\\
152 - and people like a little privacy.\\
153 - Well, these aren't people.\\
154 - They're Ricky and Lucy.\\
155 - Ring the bell.\\
156 - All of a sudden you're so sensitive.\\
157 - LUCY (yelling): "I was right. I knew
it.
I was right.\\
158 - You do hate me, don't you?"\\
159 - No, wait.\\
160 - "No, you wouldn't.\\
161 - You wouldn't strike me!"\\
162 - What's going on In there?\\
163 - "Go ahead, you cad, hit me!\\
164 - "I dare you. I dare you.\\
165 - I dare you!"\\
166 - Ah!\\
167 - She went one "I dare you" too far.\\
168 - She should know better\\
169 - than to dare that hot-blooded Cuban.\\
170 - Why, that big bum hit her.\\
171 - No, Fred, wait.\\
172 - Come here.
I'm thinking of them.\\
173 - When they hear the bell\\
174 - they'll go to neutral corners.\\
175 - We can't just bust in on them at a
time like this.\\
176 - Don't you feel well, Ethel?\\
177 - I thought you'd be dying to get in
there\\
178 - and see what the fight's all about.\\
179 - Fred... No, there's just one decent
thing to do.\\
180 - We'll go downstairs and phone.\\
181 - What for?\\
182 - To let them know we're coming up.\\
183 - Then we'll go in and see what the
fight's about.\\
184 - "Later that night\\
185 - "Madge was crying softly in her room\\
186 - "waiting for the phone to ring.\\
187 - "They said they'd call\\
188 - "if they found Gordon's battered body\\
189 - "when they dragged the river.\\
190 - "She waited and waited.\\
191 - Wouldn't that phone ever ring?"\\
192 - (phone rings)
They found the body!\\
193 - Honey, what's the matter?!\\
194 - (phone ringing)\\
195 - That's our phone.\\
196 - Oh.\\
197 - Hello?\\
198 - Hello, Lucy.
This is Ethel.\\
199 - Are you all right?\\
200 - Yeah. Why?\\
201 - Lucy, this is Ethel.\\
202 - Yeah, I know.\\
203 - This is Ethel, your friend.\\
204 - To whom you may turn in a moment of
crisis.\\
205 - Ethel, have you been drinking?\\
206 - Okay, don't tell me.\\
207 - We thought we'd come up.\\
208 - Unless, of course, there's some
reason\\
209 - you don't want to see us right now.\\
210 - No, come on up.
We're just sitting here reading.\\
211 - "We're just sitting here reading,"
she says.\\
212 - Okay, we'll be up.\\
213 - Anything we can bring?\\
214 - Cookies? Ice cream? Iodine?\\
215 - No, not a thing.
Come on up.\\
216 - Okay.\\
217 - Iodine?\\
218 - What does Ethel want?\\
219 - They're coming up.\\
220 - Oh, I want to find out\\
221 - what happened to Madge and Gordon.\\
222 - Well, we'll find out later.\\
223 - I'm going to go put on a new face.
All right.\\
224 - Oh, listen, honey,\\
225 - put this by the bed\\
226 - and then we can read it before we go
to sleep.\\
227 - Oh! My eye!\\
228 - Oh, honey... oh, what happened,
honey?\\
229 - Oh...\\
230 - Oh, honey, oh, I'm sorry.\\
231 - -Did I hit you in the eye?
-Oh, yes.\\
232 - Oh, gee, honey, I'm sorry, doll.\\
233 - Well, it wasn't your fault, honey.\\
234 - Oh, gosh, it hurts so.
Right there.\\
235 - Let me look at it.
Oh...\\
236 - Oh, you sure got a whack.
Oh...\\
237 - It's starting to get black already.\\
238 - Oh, really?\\
239 - That's all I need: a black eye.\\
240 - (doorbell buzzes)
Oh, honey.\\
241 - Oh, that must be the Mertzes.
You let them in.\\
242 - I'm going to go put something cold on
this.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.\\
243 - It's all right, dear.\\
244 - Oh...\\
245 - Hi, Ethel.\\
246 - Hello, Ricky.\\
247 - Hi, Fred.\\
248 - Hi, Rick.\\
249 - Where's Lucy?\\
250 - Oh, she'll be right in.\\
251 - Won't you sit down?\\
252 - FRED: Fine.\\
253 - Honey, it is the Mertzes!\\
254 - They're here!\\
255 - He's a cool customer, isn't he?\\
256 - Fast, too.\\
257 - He hasn't got a scratch on him.\\
258 - What's new?\\
259 - Oh, nothing.\\
260 - Nothing.\\
261 - What's new up here?\\
262 - Nothing.\\
263 - Just sitting around.\\
264 - Oh?\\
265 - I see.\\
266 - Uh...\\
267 - would you, uh...\\
268 - Would you like a drink or something?\\
269 - Oh, no, thanks.
No?	No, thanks.\\
270 - Hi, folks.\\
271 - Lucy...\\
272 - Oh, you poor little thing.\\
273 - What? Oh, my eye.\\
274 - FRED: Yeah, your eye.\\
275 - ETHEL: How did it happen?\\
276 - Oh...\\
277 - Ricky slugged me.\\
278 - Yeah.\\
279 - Yeah, I finally decided to, boom, let
her have it.\\
280 - (laughing)\\
281 - Oh, you better come down and stay
with us, honey.\\
282 - What?\\
283 - What do you mean, Ethel?\\
284 - Imagine, striking a woman.\\
285 - Oh, Fred, Ethel, I was just kidding.\\
286 - Now, don't try to protect him, honey.\\
287 - He isn't worth it.\\
288 - No, really.\\
289 - I just said that Ricky slugged me\\
290 - because nobody ever believes\\
291 - the real story of a black eye.\\
292 - RICKY: Yeah.\\
293 - And what is the real story?\\
294 - Ricky tossed a book to me, I missed
it,\\
295 - and it hit me in the eye.\\
296 - Yeah.\\
297 - Oh, come now.\\
298 - You can do better than that.\\
299 - No, really, Ethel, that's what
happened.\\
300 - How do you like it, they never
believe the real story.\\
301 - How do you like that?\\
302 - For goodness' sakes, Ethel,\\
303 - you don't think\\
304 - that I would actually hit Lucy, do
you?\\
305 - Apparently they don't want to take us\\
306 - into their confidence.\\
307 - Come on, Fred.\\
308 - Oh, now, Ethel, come here.\\
309 - No. There are times\\
310 - when even the best friends are
unwelcome.\\
311 - Now, wait a minute, you two.\\
312 - Now, listen, Fred, let me explain to
you what...\\
313 - Please, please.\\
314 - Don't drag us into your sordid family
squabbles.\\
315 - Shall we go, Ethel?\\
316 - (door closes)\\
317 - Well, did you ever?\\
318 - How do you like that?\\
319 - Well, I'll explain it to her in the
morning.\\
320 - Come on, now we can find out\\
321 - what happened to Madge and Gordon.\\
322 - Okay.\\
323 - (vacuum running)\\
324 - Good morning, Lucy.\\
325 - Oh, hi, Ethel.\\
326 - Has the brute gone?\\
327 - Who?\\
328 - Oh, Ricky.\\
329 - Yeah, he's gone to rehearsal.\\
330 - Let me see your eye.\\
331 - Oh, boy.\\
332 - That rat really gave you a mouse.\\
333 - Gee, I'm sorry I talked to you\\
334 - the way I did last night.\\
335 - I couldn't sleep a wink.\\
336 - Well, honey, I accept your apology.\\
337 - I'm not apologizing.\\
338 - I couldn't sleep\\
339 - 'cause I didn't know the real story.\\
340 - Come on, tell me. What happened?\\
341 - I told you, Ethel:\\
342 - Ricky tossed a book to me, I missed
it\\
343 - and it hit me in the eye.\\
344 - I know, I know.\\
345 - That's the story for publication.\\
346 - Now, what's the gory truth?\\
347 - How many times do I have to tell you,
honey?\\
348 - Ricky tossed a...\\
349 - You're not going to be satisfied\\
350 - until you get a real juicy story out
of me, are you?\\
351 - No.\\
352 - Come on.\\
353 - Okay.\\
354 - Well, last night\\
355 - Ricky and I were sitting around after
dinner.\\
356 - We got into a little argument.\\
357 - Close your mouth.\\
358 - Where was I?\\
359 - You were sitting around after dinner\\
360 - when, suddenly, Ricky grabbed you by
the hair\\
361 - and slugged you.\\
362 - Yeah.\\
363 - Go on.\\
364 - Well, like you say,\\
365 - he grabbed me by the hair, and he
slugged me.\\
366 - Yeah.
No!\\
367 - And then he slugged me again...\\
368 - Pow! Oh!\\
369 - Pow! Oh!\\
370 - Pow! Oh!\\
371 - And then what?\\
372 - He came at me.\\
373 - You know how wild those Cubans are\\
374 - when they get mad.\\
375 - He grabbed me by the throat.\\
376 - I gasped for air.\\
377 - (gasping)\\
378 - I cried for mercy.\\
379 - "Mercy! Mercy! Mercy!"\\
380 - And then he said he hated you.\\
381 - Okay.\\
382 - Finally, who knows why, he let go.\\
383 - And I lay there cowering and
whimpering...\\
384 - "Please, no, oh, oh, no."\\
385 - He just looked down at me, and he
laughed.\\
386 - "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"\\
387 - And then he kicked me.\\
388 - He was just about to kick me again\\
389 - when the phone rang.\\
390 - Oh, this is even better than I
expected.\\
391 - Uh, what started it all?\\
392 - What made him so mad?\\
393 - I don't know.\\
394 - You don't know?\\
395 - No. We were just sitting around\\
396 - talking about the weather, his new
show at the club.\\
397 - I told him I was in love with another
man\\
398 - and all of a sudden, for no reason at
all...\\
399 - Wait a minute.\\
400 - Wait a minute. Back up.\\
401 - You said you were in love with
another man?\\
402 - Oh, no, no, I didn't say that.\\
403 - Who is it?! Who? Who?\\
404 - Nobody. I couldn't possibly tell you,
Ethel.\\
405 - Why, is it somebody I know?\\
406 - Who is it?!\\
407 - I'm not going to tell you.\\
408 - Oh, Lucy, you can't stop there.
I am not going to tell you.\\
409 - I didn't sleep a wink last night.
I shouldn't have told you...\\
410 - Well, what am I going to do tonight?
No! I am not going to tell you.\\
411 - FRED: Oh, Rick!\\
412 - Hey, Ricky!\\
413 - Wait a minute.\\
414 - Oh, hiya, Fred.
What's the matter?\\
415 - Where you rushing off to?\\
416 - Well, I'm going to rehearsal.\\
417 - I'm late now.
What's up?\\
418 - Well, I wanted to talk to you about
last night.\\
419 - I wasn't really sore at you.\\
420 - I was going along with Ethel.\\
421 - Last night?
Yeah.\\
422 - Oh! Well, let me tell you about
that...\\
423 - Listen, I know just how you felt.\\
424 - No, you don't.\\
425 - Oh, yes I do.\\
426 - I've been married a lot longer than
you have.\\
427 - And you should never have lost your
temper that much.\\
428 - However, it's done, and there's one
way out of it.\\
429 - I see. What's that?\\
430 - Don't stand on false pride.\\
431 - Whether you're right or wrong\\
432 - be big about it.\\
433 - Apologize.\\
434 - Send her some flowers.\\
435 - Well, that's very sweet of you\\
436 - to be so concerned about it, Fred,\\
437 - but, uh, I told you what happened
last night.\\
438 - You don't think that I would ever\\
439 - really hit Lucy, do you?\\
440 - If you give her a chance to brood\\
441 - it'll cost more than flowers.\\
442 - Now, why don't you be smart?\\
443 - Look, Fred, I'm late.\\
444 - I'll talk to you about it later.\\
445 - Now, listen, I really know about
these things, Rick.\\
446 - Come on in now and send her some
flowers.\\
447 - Wait a minute, Fred.\\
448 - This is getting silly.\\
449 - I didn't do anything last night.\\
450 - I'm not going to send anybody any
flowers,\\
451 - and I'm already late for rehearsal,
so good-bye.\\
452 - (Ricky chuckles)\\
453 - Good morning, Mr. Mertz.\\
454 - Oh, hello, Pete.\\
455 - I want you to pick me out a dozen
beautiful red roses\\
456 - and I'd like to have them delivered
this afternoon.\\
457 - Gee, I'm afraid you're too late.\\
458 - Our delivery truck is just leaving.\\
459 - See if you can catch him, will you?\\
460 - I'll try.
Thanks.\\
461 - Hey, Phil!\\
462 - Phil, hold it a second!\\
463 - Hold it!\\
464 - Okay, I caught him.\\
465 - Oh, fine. Thanks.\\
466 - I'll have this card ready in a
minute.\\
467 - Right.\\
468 - Hey, Pete, what are these?\\
469 - Gladiolus.\\
470 - Gladiolus?
That's right.\\
471 - They're beautiful.\\
472 - Put some of those in, will ya?\\
473 - Okay, fine.\\
474 - They're grand.\\
475 - Mm-hmm.\\
476 - There we are.\\
477 - There, you got 'em?\\
478 - One second.\\
479 - Address is right on that envelope.\\
480 - Okay, fine.\\
481 - They'll have it in a jiffy.\\
482 - Well, they're on their way.\\
483 - Oh, fine.\\
484 - I want them to get up there\\
485 - before her husband gets home.\\
486 - Why, Mr. Mertz!\\
487 - Oh, now, now, now.\\
488 - Just a minute.\\
489 - Ricky and Lucy had a little fight
last night.\\
490 - Ricky's a little stubborn\\
491 - so I'm sending her some roses in his
name.\\
492 - Oh, I see.\\
493 - Wait till she sees that card.\\
494 - I wrote, "Darling, I love you, I love
you,\\
495 - I love you."\\
496 - Oh.\\
497 - And then I signed it, "Eternally
yours, Fred."\\
498 - Fred?\\
499 - Fred!\\
500 - Stop that truck!\\
501 - Get that card!\\
502 - It's too late!
It's left.\\
503 - Oh, no!\\
504 - Wait a minute!
You didn't pay me!\\
505 - Hey, Fred.\\
506 - What's the matter with you?\\
507 - Nothing.\\
508 - Well, why did you run in the door
like that?\\
509 - Well, well, I-I couldn't wait to get
home to you.\\
510 - Oh.\\
511 - Me?!\\
512 - Yeah.\\
513 - Hey, you haven't seen any deliveries\\
514 - in the last few minutes...\\
515 - Laundry? Groceries?\\
516 - No, nothing like that.\\
517 - Oh.
Just a florist.\\
518 - He left some flowers for Lucy\\
519 - and she wasn't home, so I took 'em.\\
520 - Yeah? Well, where are they?\\
521 - I put them up in her apartment.\\
522 - Gee, I was dying to peek in the box
and see who they were from.\\
523 - If she doesn't come home pretty soon,
I think I will.\\
524 - Oh, no, no, no!\\
525 - I don't want my wife doing anything
like that.\\
526 - Besides, they must be from Ricky.\\
527 - Maybe they are, and maybe they
aren't.\\
528 - Well, I'll see you later.\\
529 - Where are you going?\\
530 - Uh...
I'm going to turn the heat up.\\
531 - It's cold in here.\\
532 - Turn the heat up?\\
533 - It's like an oven in here!\\
534 - Yeah, by gosh, you're right.\\
535 - I better turn the heat down.\\
536 - Lucy?\\
537 - ETHEL: Lucy?\\
538 - (knocking)\\
539 - Lucy?\\
540 - Lucy?\\
541 - (key turning in lock)\\
542 - Ooh!\\
543 - Gee.\\
544 - Ooh!\\
545 - La, la-la-la\\
546 - Oh, hello, Lucy!\\
547 - Hi!\\
548 - I didn't know you were home.\\
549 - Yeah, I just got here.\\
550 - Look, Ethel... flowers!\\
551 - Oh...?\\
552 - Gee, I wonder who they're from.\\
553 - So do I.\\
554 - They're probably from... him.\\
555 - "Him"?\\
556 - Him whom?\\
557 - You know him whom.\\
558 - M.L.\\
559 - Oh...!\\
560 - Mystery lover.\\
561 - They're probably from Ricky.\\
562 - Ooh, I'm so excited!\\
563 - Oh! Aren't they lovely!\\
564 - Oh, gee.\\
565 - Yeah, they're from Ricky.\\
566 - Yeah? Look at the card and see.\\
567 - Ethel, I wouldn't do this for anyone
but you.\\
568 - Here, you look at the card\\
569 - and then you'll know who my mystery
lover is.\\
570 - Okay.\\
571 - "Darling, I love you, I love you, I
love you.\\
572 - Eternally yours, Fred."\\
573 - Fred?!
Fred?!\\
574 - Fred who?\\
575 - You know Fred who.\\
576 - Oh, now, Ethel,\\
577 - you certainly don't think\\
578 - that these are from Fred Mertz, do
you?\\
579 - Well, this card certainly\\
580 - wasn't written By Fred MacMurray.\\
581 - Oh, now, Ethel.\\
582 - Fred, my beautiful, fat old goat\\
583 - your mystery lover.\\
584 - This is just ridiculous.\\
585 - How can I fall for a fat old goat
like him?\\
586 - Don't you talk like that about Fred!\\
587 - Well, you said it first.\\
588 - Well, I can say it.\\
589 - He's my old goat.\\
590 - This is just silly.
I'm not going to discuss it.\\
591 - Oh, yes, you are!\\
592 - Oh, no, I'm not!\\
593 - Oh, yes, you are!\\
594 - Oh, no, I'm not!
I'm not going to say one word!
Oh, yes, you are!\\
595 - Wait a minute.\\
596 - Well, if it isn't old mystery lover.\\
597 - Fred, what were you doing in my
closet?\\
598 - "Fred, what were you doing in my
closet?"\\
599 - Oh, brother.\\
600 - Ethel, my love!\\
601 - Don't you "Ethel, my love" me!\\
602 - Oh!\\
603 - My eye!\\
604 - My eye!\\
605 - Oh, Ethel, really!\\
606 - Don't you talk to me!\\
607 - RICKY: Fred, how are you?
What's the matter?\\
608 - FRED: I'll show you what the matter
is! This is!\\
609 - (punch landing)\\
610 - RICKY: Oh!\\
611 - What happened?\\
612 - (clears throat)\\
613 - Well?\\
614 - Ethel and I have an apology to make.\\
615 - Oh?\\
616 - You remember that story you told us\\
617 - about you getting a black eye when
Ricky tossed a book to you?\\
618 - Yes?\\
619 - It is possible.\\
620 - Oh. And how did you finally arrive\\
621 - at that conclusion?\\
622 - Ethel!\\
623 - Oh, no.\\
624 - (chuckles)\\
625 - Did Fred tell you how it happened?\\
626 - You mean that phony story about
tossing a book to you?\\
627 - Yeah.\\
628 - Oh, come now.\\
629 - You can do a lot better than that,
can't you?\\
630 - (laughing)\\
631 - Oh, Lucy, I'm sorry I didn't believe
you.\\
632 - I'm sorry, too, Rick.\\
633 - It can happen.\\
634 - That's all right, Fred.\\
635 - I wanted to take a couple of days off
from work anyway.\\
636 - Oh, Ricky, you're a wonderful sport.\\

1 - (I Love Lucy theme music plays)\\
2 - Lucy?\\
3 - Oh, hi, Ethel.
Lucy isn't here.\\
4 - She took the baby down to Mrs.
Jenkins.\\
5 - What's going on around here?\\
6 - Oh, Lucy rearranged the furniture
again.\\
7 - But she just rearranged it last week.\\
8 - No!\\
9 - Oh, well, she'll rearrange it back
again in a couple of days.\\
10 - I just hope that she gets my favorite
chair\\
11 - over there where there's some light
so I can see.\\
12 - What makes Lucy change her mind like
this?\\
13 - Ask Lucy, Ethel.\\
14 - Yeah.\\
15 - This is nothing.\\
16 - You remember the time\\
17 - that we went to the roof garden to
have dinner?\\
18 - Oh, yeah.\\
19 - What a night.\\
20 - The whole evening started off wrong.\\
21 - I was just sitting here, waiting for
Lucy to get ready.\\
22 - Lucy!\\
23 - I'll be ready in a minute, dear.\\
24 - "I'll be ready in a minute, dear."\\
25 - Hi, Ricky.\\
26 - Hi, Ethel.\\
27 - Hi, Rick.\\
28 - Hi, Fred.\\
29 - Well, we're all set.\\
30 - Is Lucy ready?\\
31 - Oh, sure.\\
32 - Isn't she ready yet?\\
33 - I thought you were going to get her
started\\
34 - earlier tonight so we can have dinner
and then go to a movie.\\
35 - I started her at 2:00 this afternoon.\\
36 - That early enough?\\
37 - What's she doing?\\
38 - Well, she's trying to make up her
mind.\\
39 - First she couldn't decide what movie
she wanted to go to.\\
40 - That took until 5:00.\\
41 - Then she couldn't decide what dress
she was gonna wear.\\
42 - No, no, son, that's your fault.\\
43 - You've trained her wrong.\\
44 - You mean that doesn't happen at your
house?\\
45 - I should say not.\\
46 - The first dress Ethel puts on is the
dress she wears.\\
47 - Oh, how do you manage that?\\
48 - That's easy. I've only got one dress.\\
49 - Very funny.\\
50 - Go on, Rick, will you?
Do something.\\
51 - LUCY: I'll be ready in a minute,
dear!\\
52 - I swear that she can see through the
walls.\\
53 - Boy, I'm starved.\\
54 - Oh, you can live off your fat\\
55 - for a few more minutes.\\
56 - You might as well get comfortable.\\
57 - Sit down, will you?\\
58 - Well, come on.
What are you waiting for?\\
59 - Where are you going to dinner?\\
60 - I don't know.\\
61 - How about some good Italian food?\\
62 - Oh, you know, I kind of felt like
Chinese food tonight.\\
63 - Well, that's okay with me as long as
we eat.\\
64 - Yeah, me, too.
How about you, Lucy?\\
65 - Gee, they both sound so good.\\
66 - I like Chinese food, but I'm crazy
about Italian food, too.\\
67 - Well, maybe we can find a place\\
68 - that serves ravioli foo yong.\\
69 - Or chicken chow pizza.\\
70 - Uh, Italian food sounds okay by me.\\
71 - All right.
Okay.\\
72 - Let's go.\\
73 - Let's go.\\
74 - Oh, darn it!\\
75 - As you were, diners.\\
76 - I just happened to think,\\
77 - we ate Italian food a couple of
nights ago.\\
78 - All right, then, we'll have Chinese
food.\\
79 - All right.\\
80 - Okay.\\
81 - Oh, wait a minute!\\
82 - Don't tell me.\\
83 - You want a steak.\\
84 - No, smartie, but I just happened to
remember\\
85 - that Chinese restaurant we like so
much\\
86 - isn't open on Monday nights.\\
87 - Well, honey, there's a lot of Chinese
restaurants in town.\\
88 - We'll go to another Chinese
restaurant.\\
89 - Oh, I don't know. I don't want to go
to a strange...\\
90 - Do you want a steak?\\
91 - Oh...\\
92 - No, I don't want a steak. No.\\
93 - I just want to go anyplace-- anyplace
that I can eat--\\
94 - anything at all, I don't care where
we go.\\
95 - Well, let's go someplace that's new
and exciting.\\
96 - There's a lot of ads in the paper.\\
97 - Lucy.\\
98 - Yeah, look, here's one right here.
Come here.\\
99 - Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi...\\
100 - This looks wonderful.\\
101 - Look at this.\\
102 - See?\\
103 - (mutters)\\
104 - Fred.\\
105 - What do you think you're doing?\\
106 - Well, this may take some time,\\
107 - and I thought I'd better fortify
myself.\\
108 - It's a nice restaurant.\\
109 - Yes, it is, Lucy.\\

121 - He didn't see me.\\
122 - Uh, waiter. Waiter, we're ready to...\\
123 - Waiter?\\
124 - I'll get him when he comes back.\\
125 - I'll lay you three to one.\\
126 - Oh, uh, waiter.\\
127 - Waiter, dear!\\
128 - Nice try.\\
129 - He gets by me again over my dead
body.\\
130 - Well, are we ready to order now?\\

132 - I'd like roast beef, please.\\
133 - Yeah, one roast beef.\\

135 - Uh, yes, pardon me just a second.\\
136 - I'll be back in a moment.\\
137 - Honey, that's the first time\\
138 - that I heard you make up your mind
and order just like that.\\
139 - Well, I happened to know what I
wanted.\\
140 - Look, honey, there's an empty table\\
141 - back there by the window.\\
142 - Let's move back there.\\
143 - Honey, what's wrong with this table?\\
144 - Oh, but look, we have that nice view\\
145 - while we're eating.
Come on!\\
146 - Oh, now, Lucy!\\
147 - Honey, now, wait a minute.\\

180 - And what would you like, Ethel?\\
181 - I think I'll have the lamb chops.\\
182 - One lamb chops.\\
183 - FRED: What looks good to you, Rick?\\
184 - RICKY: Well...\\
185 - Lamb chops, huh?\\
186 - See, that sounds good.\\
187 - They're not fattening either.\\
188 - Would you mind changing my order to
lamb chops?\\
189 - Two lamb chops.\\
190 - That's two for each of us.\\
191 - Yes.\\
192 - Oh, an-and, uh, I don't want too much
fat on mine,\\
193 - but I would like them extra thick.\\
194 - Maybe you'd like to have me trot the
lamb by,\\
195 - and you can pick out\\
196 - the chops you want.\\
197 - Well!\\
198 - Lucy, please?\\
199 - Go ahead, Rick, order somethin'.\\
200 - Sirloin steak.\\
201 - Uh, yes, sir.\\
202 - How would you like it?\\
203 - Rare.\\
204 - Thick and juicy.\\
205 - Yes, sir.
And you, sir?\\
206 - FRED: Well, uh, let me see.\\
207 - I believe I'm going to try the, uh...\\
208 - Sirloin steak, huh?\\
209 - How would you like it, madam?\\
210 - Well, medium or rare?\\
211 - Rare.\\
212 - Pork chops.\\
213 - Yes, sir.\\
214 - Now, what would you like to drink?\\
215 - Well, I...\\
216 - You order last.\\
217 - Um, coffee for me.\\
218 - I'll have coffee, too.\\
219 - Two coffees.\\
220 - Milk.\\
221 - Milk. Now, madam, what would you
like?\\
222 - Pork chops, huh?\\
223 - Would it be too much bother\\
224 - to change my order to pork chops?\\
225 - Why, no, madam.\\
226 - Whatever gave you that idea?\\
227 - I'd like two pork chops, please.\\
228 - Very well.\\
229 - Why don't you write it down?\\
230 - I already did when he ordered it.\\
231 - Now, let's see if I've got this
straight.\\
232 - Lamb chops for you, sirloin steak for
you,\\
233 - uh, pork chops for you, pork chops
for you,\\
234 - and a new eraser for me.\\
235 - You know, with all this talk about
pork chops, I...\\
236 - Yeesh!\\
237 - I guess I'll stick to lamb chops.\\
238 - Now, how about shrimp cocktails all
around?\\
239 - Uh...\\
240 - That'd be fine.
Thank you very much.\\
241 - WAITER: Thank you, sir.\\
242 - What did you do that for?\\
243 - Honey, I'm sick and tired\\
244 - of hearing you change your mind every
two seconds.\\
245 - Well, I couldn't help it.\\
246 - Everything everybody ordered sounded
so wonderful.\\
247 - Fine thing, you come to a restaurant\\
248 - and you can't even order what you...\\
249 - (sneezes)\\
250 - Bless you!\\
251 - You catching a cold, honey?\\
252 - Well, there's a horrible draft in
here.\\
253 - You want to change places with me?\\
254 - Oh, no, that wouldn't do any good.\\
255 - Oh, look, there's an empty table over
there.\\
256 - Let's go over there.\\
257 - Stand by for another troop movement.\\
258 - Honey, we're going to stay right
here.\\
259 - No, now, come on.
It's nice over th...\\
260 - Sit down!\\
261 - What do you want me to do?\\
262 - Catch my death of cold?\\
263 - No, but we came from there...\\
264 - Well, then come on.
Come on over here.\\
265 - There's no reason why we can't move
over here.\\
266 - ETHEL: Why fight it?\\
267 - RICKY: Okay, here we go again.\\
268 - See how much better it is over here?\\
269 - Mm-mm-hmm.\\
270 - I hate to sit in a draft.\\
271 - All right, hon.\\
272 - Oh, uh, we're over here now.\\
273 - You see, we were over there, but
there was such a draft,\\
274 - I couldn't...\\
275 - (music)\\
276 - Good morning, Lucy.\\
277 - Hi.\\
278 - What are you doing?\\
279 - Oh, I've been cleaning out that
closet.\\
280 - Oh.\\
281 - I'm on a new regime.\\
282 - I'm gonna finish everything I start.\\
283 - I started cleaning out that closet 11
years ago.\\
284 - 11 Years ago?\\
285 - Yeah, right after we were married.\\
286 - You should see the stuff I found in
there.\\
287 - I've just been reading some of my old
mementos.\\
288 - Uh, Lucy, tell me something.\\
289 - How did you happen to start on this
new regime?\\
290 - Oh, I just thought it was the thing
to do.\\
291 - Lucy, does anybody else on this floor\\
292 - speak with an accent?\\
293 - What do you mean by that?\\
294 - Well, last night\\
295 - when I was out in the hall changing a
lightbulb,\\
296 - and I heard some Cuban\\
297 - yelling at his wife\\
298 - and saying that from now on,\\
299 - she had to finish everything she
starts.\\
300 - Ethel, do you sleep with your ears
under or over the covers?\\
301 - Well, the walls of this apartment are
pretty thin.\\
302 - (laughs)\\
303 - He really was upset, wasn't he?\\
304 - Wasn't he?\\
305 - (both laugh)\\
306 - Why, his face turned absolutely
purple.\\
307 - These walls are a lot thinner than I
thought.\\
308 - Uh...\\
309 - I mean, he sounded like it was
purple.\\
310 - Oh.\\
311 - Hey, listen to this.
I wrote this 15 years ago.\\
312 - "Dearest, darling Tom,\\
313 - As long as I live, I can never forget
you."\\
314 - Tom who?\\
315 - I don't remember.\\
316 - Oh, fine.\\
317 - "Being with you the other night was
pure heaven.\\
318 - Remember how we..."\\
319 - Well, don't stop now.
Go on.\\
320 - That's all there is.\\
321 - Oh.\\
322 - Oh, I remember now.\\
323 - It was Tom Henderson.\\
324 - And just as I was writing this
letter,\\
325 - he called on the phone, we had a big
fight,\\
326 - and I never finished it.\\
327 - Oh.\\
328 - Oh, I should never have fought with
him.\\
329 - He now owns a swanky fur salon
downtown.\\
330 - Oh, you fool.\\
331 - Yeah.\\
332 - Oh, well, so much for Tom Henderson.\\
333 - Hey... I'm supposed to finish
everything I start, aren't I?\\
334 - Uh-huh.\\
335 - Uh-huh.\\
336 - Uh-huh.\\
337 - Lucy, are you gonna finish that
letter?\\
338 - Uh-huh.\\
339 - Are you gonna mail it?\\
340 - No.\\
341 - Well, what's the use?
Who'll see it?\\
342 - A certain purple-faced Cuban we both
know.\\
343 - (laughs)\\
344 - As long as he's so insistent that I
finish everything,\\
345 - I'm going to have a little fun with
him.\\
346 - Let's see now.\\
347 - "Being with you the other night was
pure heaven.\\
348 - "Remember how we...\\
349 - "Remember how we...\\
350 - laughed... and what fun we had?"\\
351 - (giggling)\\
352 - (wicked laugh)\\
353 - Hee, hee.\\
354 - Uh, "See you for lunch tomorrow.
Love, Lucy."\\
355 - (giggling)\\
356 - Now, I'll just be finishing this when
Ricky comes in,\\
357 - and I'll get all flustered when he
catches me, see?\\
358 - Oh, Lucy, I wish you had a window in
your forehead\\
359 - so I could peek in and watch those
wheels go 'round.\\
360 - You'd better go now.\\
361 - Ricky's gonna home for lunch any
minute.\\
362 - Okay. Good luck.\\
363 - Okay.\\
364 - (doorknob turning)\\
365 - Well... oh, I... I...\\
366 - Oh, Ethel!\\
367 - Oh, I'm sorry, but I just got to
thinking it over.\\
368 - Do you think this is safe,\\
369 - what with Ricky's temper and all?\\
370 - Oh, sure.\\
371 - Well, good luck.\\
372 - Okay.\\
373 - (sighs)\\
374 - FRED: Psst! Psst!\\
375 - Hey, Rick.\\
376 - Hiya, Fred.\\
377 - I've been waiting for ya.\\
378 - Yeah? What happened?\\
379 - We men have to stick together.\\
380 - What do you mean?\\
381 - Ethel couldn't keep her big
blabbermouth closed,\\
382 - so she told me a secret.\\
383 - What's that?\\
384 - Lucy found an old, unfinished love
letter.\\
385 - Oh?\\
386 - Yeah, but she finished it this
afternoon,\\
387 - and now she's waiting to have a
little fun with you.\\
388 - (chuckling)\\
389 - Is that so?\\
390 - Yeah.\\
391 - All right, Fred, thanks for telling
me.\\
392 - I'll see you later.\\
393 - All right.\\
394 - Ha, ha, ha!\\
395 - A little fun, eh?\\
396 - Oh! Hi, honey.\\
397 - Hi, honey.\\
398 - Oh! Uh...\\
399 - Uh... oh.\\
400 - Uh, what you got there?\\
401 - Where?\\
402 - In back of you there.\\
403 - Oh, nothing.\\
404 - It-it's not for you to see.\\
405 - Oh. Oh, it's a surprise for me, eh?\\
406 - Uh, yeah.\\
407 - Well, I can wait.\\
408 - All right, all right.\\
409 - You want me to see the letter, let me
have it.\\
410 - No, no. I don't want you to see it!\\
411 - Honey, you've been waving it around
like a flag.\\
412 - Now, come on.
What is it?\\
413 - Is it a bill?\\
414 - No.\\
415 - (laughing loudly)\\
416 - (laughing harder)\\
417 - What are you laughing at?\\
418 - Oh, this is very funny, this letter.\\
419 - (chuckles)\\
420 - What's the gag?\\
421 - It's no gag.\\
422 - I guess I had to expect that sooner
or later,\\
423 - you'd... find out.\\
424 - Now, Lucy...\\
425 - we've been married for 11 years.\\
426 - I know you like a book,\\
427 - and every time you act like this,\\
428 - you must have an interior motive.\\
429 - "Ulterior," and I have not.\\
430 - Come, come, now.\\
431 - Are you by any chance\\
432 - trying to get back at me for that
scolding\\
433 - that I gave you the other night?\\
434 - No, and you think you're so smart.\\
435 - Lucy?\\
436 - Well, I'm not!\\
437 - That's just what it looks like.\\
438 - It's, it's a letter to Tom Henderson.\\
439 - Oh, Tom Henderson?\\
440 - Yes. He's a big fur man downtown\\
441 - and-and Tom and I used to go to
college together\\
442 - and-and we used to go around a lot
together\\
443 - and we've been seeing each other
since, that's all.\\
444 - Oh, well, if that's all...\\
445 - (dismissive chuckle)\\
446 - You don't believe me, do you?\\
447 - Sure, honey, sure, I believe you,
yeah.\\
448 - It's the truth!\\
449 - Well, then, uh, you don't mind if I
mail the letter?\\
450 - No. I-I wrote it to be mailed.\\
451 - All right.\\
452 - I'll mail it on my way to the club
tonight.\\
453 - Go ahead and see if I care.\\
454 - See if I care about anything that you
do!\\
455 - (laughing)\\
456 - I heard the voices being raised.\\
457 - (chortling)\\
458 - Oh, boy, is she mad.\\
459 - What did you do?\\
460 - I told her I was going to mail the
letter.\\
461 - That's not cricket, old boy.\\
462 - (both laugh)\\
463 - Are you really gonna mail it?\\
464 - No. I'm just gonna to let her stew\\
465 - in her own goose for a while.\\
466 - What's the matter?\\
467 - Nothing.\\
468 - I know what you mean all right,\\
469 - but I just never heard it put that
way before.\\
470 - I don't know why you wanted to come
down here anyway.\\
471 - Because Ricky mailed the letter.\\
472 - I have to explain to Tom.\\
473 - Okay. Come on.\\
474 - Now, wait a minute.\\
475 - I have to think what I'm going to
say.\\
476 - I haven't seen Tom Henderson in 15
years.\\
477 - He'll think I'm crazy.\\
478 - Oh, he'll understand.\\
479 - Well, I hope you're right.\\
480 - Gee, Ethel, do you think I've changed
any in 15 years?\\
481 - I got a little older, huh?\\
482 - Don't be silly.
Women don't get older.\\
483 - They just mature a little.\\
484 - Men get older.\\
485 - Yeah. Well, of course, in Tom's case,\\
486 - it won't make any difference.\\
487 - He was so handsome to start with.\\
488 - He was certainly a gorgeous hunk of
man.\\
489 - Well, come on.\\
490 - Hey, wait a minute.\\
491 - You don't suppose that's Tom, do you?\\
492 - Oh, he couldn't have changed that
much.\\
493 - I'll have it for you Tuesday.\\
494 - Good-bye, Mrs. Corner.\\
495 - Good-bye, Mr. Henderson.\\
496 - Mr. Henderson.\\
497 - That must be Tom.\\
498 - That's a gorgeous hunk of man?!\\
499 - Looks like my hunk has shrunk.\\
500 - Come on, let's forget the whole
thing.\\
501 - (gasps): Look!\\
502 - Ricky and Fred!\\
503 - Yeah. They must have followed us.\\
504 - Well, let's make a run for it, huh?\\
505 - No, honey, they've seen us. It's too
late.\\
506 - Listen, you-you go in there and
pretend to buy a coat\\
507 - or something get Tom out of the way.\\
508 - What good will that do?\\
509 - Go on. I'll think of something.\\
510 - Okay.\\
511 - I have just what you want, Mrs.
Mertz.\\
512 - I've got one on display in the
window.\\
513 - Uh, silver fox?\\
514 - You know, Fred, I think this time\\
515 - she's really jumped her trolley.\\
516 - Looks like.\\
517 - Oh, hi, Ricky.\\
518 - How nice to see you, dear.\\
519 - And don't bother turning around, Tom.\\
520 - It's just my husband.\\
521 - (laughing giddily)\\
522 - What's going on here?\\
523 - Oh, uh, Tom was just going to teach
me a new dance step,\\
524 - Weren't you, dear?\\
525 - How's that go again now?\\
526 - One, two, three, four.\\
527 - One, two, three, four.\\
528 - One, two, three, four.\\
529 - One, two...\\
530 - (laughing)\\
531 - (Ricky laughing uncontrollably)\\
532 - (laughter continues)\\
533 - (still laughing)\\
534 - Is this your old boyfriend?\\
535 - He isn't half the man he used to be.\\
536 - Where, uh...
where is Tom Henderson?\\
537 - Oh, Ricky, that letter was just a
gag.\\
538 - You were so darn smart about it, you
made me mad, that's all.\\
539 - (chuckling): Well, what... what about
this dummy routine?\\
540 - Didn't you know this guy at all?\\
541 - Sure I did, but when I knew Tom,\\
542 - he was tall, dark and handsome.\\
543 - I saw him today and he's short, bald
and dumpy.\\
544 - You never would have stopped kidding
me about that.\\
545 - Well, honey, I guess I was a little
cruel.\\
546 - Listen, you'll have lunch with a
tall, dark\\
547 - and handsome man anyway.\\
548 - Come on. I'll take you.\\
549 - Okay.\\
550 - You know, it's a good thing he was a
funny-looking guy,\\
551 - otherwise you'd be plenty worried by
now,\\
552 - 'cause I was gonna go through with
it.\\
553 - Yeah, I don't have the slightest
doubt.\\
554 - (chuckling)\\
555 - ETHEL: Oh, Lucy?\\
556 - Yeah?\\
557 - Lucy, we made an awful mistake.\\
558 - This isn't Tom Henderson.\\

You settle right dow...\\
23 - What's that?\\
24 - Mrs. Trumbull upstairs.\\
25 - She's been doing that all night.\\
26 - I guess she's mad because Ricky's
crying.\\
27 - Oh, Mrs. Trumbull's such a sweet old
lady.\\
28 - I can't imagine her getting that mad.\\
29 - She must be hanging pictures.\\
30 - On the floor?\\
31 - (crying)\\
32 - Aw, now, don't you pay any attention
to that old crank.\\
33 - You just settle down now\\
34 - and stop your crying.\\

68 - Beginner's luck, nothing.\\
69 - It's my phenomenal memory.\\
70 - Memory?\\
71 - Yeah. It's not generally known,\\
72 - but I was a little bit of a baby boy
myself once.\\
73 - You know, to look at him now,\\
74 - it's hard to believe he was ever a
little baby anything.\\
75 - Well, what's the difference?\\
76 - The main thing is, Ricky's asleep.\\
77 - Yeah.\\
78 - Well, good night, honey.\\
79 - I'll see you tomorrow.\\
80 - Good night.\\
81 - Oh!\\
82 - (crying)\\
83 - Oh! Oh!\\
84 - Ricky, what's the matter with you?\\
85 - Now look what you did.\\
86 - You woke up the baby.\\
87 - What you put the crib over here for?\\
88 - What?\\
89 - You shouldn't have put the crib over
here!\\
90 - (pounding from above)\\
91 - (pounding continues)\\
92 - (crying)\\
93 - What's that?\\
94 - The art gallery upstairs.\\
95 - Huh?\\
96 - Never mind. I'll explain it to you in
the morning.\\
97 - (crying)\\
98 - Gee, I'm sorry I woke you up, old
man.\\
99 - Now that you got him awake and
yelling,\\
100 - what are you going to do about it?\\
101 - Well, I apologized to him.\\
102 - What else do you want me to do?\\
103 - I want you to put him back to sleep,\\
104 - that's what I want you to do.\\
105 - Put him back to sleep?\\
106 - Honey, I had a hard night.\\
107 - I've been working.\\
108 - What do you think I've been doing?\\
109 - Well, honey, you're supposed to put
him to sleep,\\
110 - and things like that-- you're his
mother.\\
111 - Hey, I know.\\
112 - Why don't you walk with him?\\
113 - Well, there's a fresh, new idea.\\
114 - Oh. You've been doing that.\\
115 - Yeah.\\
116 - (crying louder)\\
117 - Ricky, why don't you sing to him?\\
118 - Oh, honey, please, not tonight.\\
119 - I'm so tired.\\
120 - Come on, honey.\\
121 - Oh...\\
122 - (soft crying)\\
123 - (singing off-key:)
Rockaby baby on the treetop\\
124 - (loud crying)\\
125 - When the wind blows, the cradle will
rock\\
126 - All right! All right!
All right! All right!\\
127 - All right! All right!
All right!\\
128 - I give up! I give up!\\
129 - Anything is better than that.\\
130 - Come on, I'll do it.
I'll do it. I'll do it.\\
131 - Oh, come on, boy. Come on. Come on,
sweetheart.\\
132 - (crying)\\
133 - (tries to quiet baby)\\
134 - Come on.\\
135 - Rockaby baby on the treetop\\
136 - When the wind blows, the cradle will
rock\\
137 - Da, da-da, dee-da, da, da-da dee...\\
138 - (crying)\\
139 - Down will come baby, cradle and all\\
140 - Rockaby baby on the treetop\\
141 - When the wind blows, the cradle will
rock\\
142 - Da, da-da, dee-da, dee da-da, da...\\
143 - Hi.\\
144 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
145 - How's Little Ricky this morning?\\
146 - Oh, fine. He slept the rest of the
night.\\
147 - Where are you going all dressed up?\\
148 - I'm going shopping.\\
149 - I'm having a table of bridge
tomorrow.\\
150 - You are? So am I.\\
151 - Really?\\
152 - Yeah. Why mess up both apartments?\\
153 - Let's have them together.\\
154 - Okay.\\
155 - Let's have it up here,\\
156 - and we'll have lunch first.
All right.\\
157 - Both make half the sandwiches up.
Yep.\\
158 - Will you bring your card table, your
teapot, and your cups?\\
159 - How many cups?
Eight.\\
160 - (door buzzer)\\
161 - Eight cups. Okay, I'll bring 'em.\\
162 - Who is that?\\
163 - Oh. Mrs. Trumbull.\\
164 - Mrs. Ricardo.\\
165 - Well, Mrs. Mertz, I'm glad I found
you two together.\\
166 - ETHEL: You are?\\
167 - How are you, Mrs. Trumbull?\\
168 - As well as could be expected after
two hours' sleep.\\
169 - Oh, I'm sorry about that, Mrs.
Trumbull.\\
170 - The baby was a little fussy.\\
171 - He won't annoy you again.\\
172 - No, I'm sure of that.\\
173 - Perhaps you'll recall\\
174 - this piece of paper, Mrs. Mertz.\\
175 - Your lease?\\
176 - Yes.\\
177 - "It is expressly understood that at
no time will children\\
178 - be allowed to live in said building."\\
179 - Little Ricky.\\
180 - He's a "children."\\
181 - Since it says "no children" in plain
English,\\
182 - what excuse is there for Mrs.
Ricardo's baby?\\
183 - Uh... uh...\\
184 - He can't read.\\
185 - "He can't read."\\
186 - Did the Ricardos sign a lease like
mine, or didn't they?\\
187 - Of course they did,\\
188 - but they didn't have a baby till ten
years later.\\
189 - I'd expect them to do something
underhanded like that.\\
190 - Aw, now, Mrs. Trumbull\\
191 - can't you be a little more
understanding?\\
192 - I understand only one thing--\\
193 - either the Ricardos leave or I do.\\
194 - Mrs. Trumbull, I'd rather you didn't
force me\\
195 - to make that decision.\\
196 - Oh, Ethel, wait a minute.
You can't afford\\
197 - to have another vacant apartment.\\
198 - Don't worry, Lucy, we can rent that
apartment\\
199 - just like that.\\
200 - And even if we couldn't, it wouldn't
matter\\
201 - because my friendship with the
Ricardos\\
202 - means more to me than all the money
on Earth.\\
203 - I'm not the only tenant who feels
that way, Mrs. Mertz.\\
204 - I advise you to think it over.\\
205 - Well, I advise you to think it over.\\
206 - Well!\\
207 - Oh, Ethel, I can't let you do that.\\
208 - You'll lose all your tenants.\\
209 - We'll just have to move, that's all.\\
210 - No, you're staying.\\
211 - I won't let you out of your lease.\\
212 - Oh, Ethel, you're just about the
swellest friend\\
213 - a person ever had.\\
214 - Now, Lucy, let's not talk about it.\\
215 - If there's anything I can't stand,\\
216 - it's somebody who does something nice
for somebody\\
217 - and then talks about it all the time.\\
218 - All right.
Just forget it, honey.\\
219 - I'll see you later.
Okay.\\
220 - So long.
Bye.\\
221 - And then the old prune said,\\
222 - "Either the Ricardos leave or I do."\\
223 - And then Lucy said, "Wait a minute,
Ethel.\\
224 - You can't afford to have another
vacant apartment."\\
225 - And then what do you guess I said?\\
226 - What?\\
227 - What?\\
228 - I was there.\\
229 - Oh, yes.\\
230 - Well, I said, "Don't worry, Lucy.\\
231 - "We can rent that apartment just like
that.\\
232 - "And even if we couldn't, it wouldn't
matter,\\
233 - "because my friendship with the
Ricardos\\
234 - means more to me than all the money
on Earth."\\
235 - If I'd have been there, I'd have said
the same thing.\\
236 - Gee.\\
237 - And then she said,\\
238 - "I'm not the only tenant who feels
this way.\\
239 - I advise you to think it over."\\
240 - And I said, "Well, I advise you to
think it over."\\
241 - And then she flounced out of the
apartment.\\
242 - Ethel, I think that you're just
wonderful.\\
243 - Oh, it wasn't anything.\\
244 - Let's not talk about it anymore.\\
245 - Well, Lucy and I will never forget
it,\\
246 - will we, honey?\\
247 - No, no, we never will.\\
248 - Well, come on, Fred.\\
249 - We've got a big day tomorrow--
bridge, you know.\\
250 - Bye.
Good night.\\
251 - Bye, Lucy.
Good night.\\
252 - Good night, Rick.
Good night.\\
253 - Gee, honey, wasn't Ethel wonderful?\\
254 - Yeah. Wonderful.\\
255 - You don't sound very appreciative.\\
256 - Oh, I am, I am.\\
257 - In fact, I'm up to here with
appreciation.\\
258 - Huh?\\
259 - Well, it was nice of her, okay,\\
260 - but all day long, she's been
reenacting her scene.\\
261 - She told the mailman, the grocery
boy,\\
262 - the cop on the beat.\\
263 - This afternoon, she came down to the
beauty parlor\\
264 - while I was there and played a
matinee\\
265 - for the manicurist.\\
266 - Well, maybe she got it out of her
system by now.\\
267 - I hope so.\\
268 - Well, honey, it was nice.\\
269 - Nice, yes, but Ethel acts as if she
discovered penicillin.\\
270 - And then the old prune said,\\
271 - "Either the Ricardos move, or I
move."\\
272 - And then Lucy said, "Wait a minute,
Ethel.\\
273 - You can't afford to have another
vacant apartment."\\
274 - And then I said,\\
275 - "Lucy, don't worry.\\
276 - "We can rent that apartment just like
that,\\
277 - "and even if we couldn't, it wouldn't
matter,\\
278 - "because my friendship with the
Ricardos\\
279 - means more to me than all the money
on Earth."\\
280 - (door buzzer)\\
281 - And then she said, "Well, I advi..."\\
282 - Oh, hi!\\
283 - Oh, that hat is adorable!\\
284 - (exchanging greetings)\\
285 - Yeah, how about that, huh?\\
286 - Dorothy, come here.
I've got to tell you...\\
287 - Oh, it's been very exciting around
here.\\
288 - Wait'll you hear what happened
yesterday morning.\\
289 - You know that old Mrs. Trumbull\\
290 - that lives upstairs?
(door buzzer)\\
291 - Well, she came down here this
morning...\\
292 - Oh, too bad, honey, you're not going\\
293 - to be able to finish your story.\\
294 - The rest of the girls are here.\\
295 - Oh, well, listen...\\
296 - Oh, hi!\\
297 - That is the cutest outfit!\\
298 - How about that, huh?\\
299 - (all talking)\\
300 - ETHEL: ...and then the old prune
said, "Either the Ricardos\\
301 - leave this apartment, or I do."\\
302 - Oh, off all the nerve.\\
303 - Isn't that awful?\\
304 - And then Lucy said, "Wait a minute,
Ethel,\\
305 - you can't afford to have another
vacant apartment."\\
306 - And then I said...\\
307 - BOTH: "Lucy, don't worry.
We can rent\\
308 - "that apartment just like that, and
even\\
309 - "if we couldn't, it wouldn't
matter...\\
310 - "because my friendship with the
Ricardos\\
311 - means more to me than all the money
on Earth."\\
312 - Well!\\
313 - I'm sorry, Ethel.\\
314 - I just couldn't stand it any longer.\\
315 - Oh. You don't care how many tenants I
lose,\\
316 - but you get awfully excited\\
317 - if I tell a couple of people about
it.\\
318 - A couple of people?\\
319 - Ethel, that scene has had more
performances than South Pacific.\\
320 - Well!\\
321 - That does it.\\
322 - I'm leaving.\\
323 - My half of the party come downstairs.\\
324 - Go ahead! See if I care.\\
325 - Come on, and bring that table-- it's
mine--\\
326 - and all those dishes.\\
327 - And I'll take the sandwiches I
brought up, too.\\
328 - That's my sandwich.\\
329 - Come on, girls.\\
330 - Just a minute.\\
331 - That is my tablecloth.\\
332 - (door slamming)\\
333 - Oh, she makes me so mad...\\
334 - (Little Ricky crying)\\
335 - Oh, she woke up the baby!\\
336 - (door buzzer)\\
337 - And keep that squalling brat quiet!\\
338 - (door buzzer)\\
339 - Oh!\\
340 - Mrs. Ricardo,\\
341 - I've been trying to make up this
afternoon\\
342 - for the sleep I lost last night.\\
343 - My nerves are almost gone.\\
344 - I'd...\\
345 - I...\\
346 - If I hear that baby cry once more,\\
347 - I'm going to send for the police.\\
348 - The police?\\
349 - (crying continues)\\
350 - I'll be there, honey.\\
351 - Lucy, I'm home!\\
352 - Lucy?\\
353 - Shh! Ricky, you'll wake up the baby.\\
354 - Mrs. Trumbull said if he annoyed her
one more time,\\
355 - she was going to call the police.\\
356 - What do I care what she says?\\
357 - We got Ethel on our team.\\
358 - You'd better consult your program.\\
359 - There's been a last-minute change in
the lineup.\\
360 - Huh? What are you talking about?\\
361 - Ethel and I had a fight.\\
362 - What?!\\
363 - Well, I just couldn't stand it any
longer.\\
364 - Tallulah Mertz played her big scene
three times\\
365 - at the bridge game today.\\
366 - Finally, I just started acting it out
with her.\\
367 - Oh, Lucy, you didn't.\\
368 - Well, she makes me so mad.\\
369 - All right, honey, so she make you
mad,\\
370 - but do you have to make a big fight
out of it\\
371 - and lose your best friend?\\
372 - That's the most childish thing\\
373 - I've ever heard.\\
374 - Well...\\
375 - well, she did us a tremendous favor.\\
376 - You don't know how a thing like that
can get on your nerves.\\
377 - I do, too.\\
378 - And I also know what you're going to
do right now.\\
379 - What?
You're going to get on that phone,\\
380 - call Ethel and apologize.\\
381 - Apologize?!\\
382 - Oh, no, I'm not.\\
383 - Oh, yes, you are.\\
384 - Oh, no, I'm not.\\
385 - Oh, yes, you are.\\
386 - I am not!\\
387 - Hi.\\
388 - How about some dinner?\\
389 - Dinner?!\\
390 - Yeah. I'm hungry.\\
391 - Fred Mertz, do you mean to tell me\\
392 - that you can even think of eating\\
393 - after what happened to me this
afternoon?\\
394 - Well, no, I can't, but my stomach
can.\\
395 - Now, look, honey, you're making
entirely too much out of this.\\
396 - Too much?!\\
397 - Do you realize what happened to me up
there today?\\
398 - We were having a perfectly nice
bridge luncheon\\
399 - and I was telling the girls...\\
400 - I know--\\
401 - you told me, you told me.\\
402 - That's the trouble with you--\\
403 - you keep harping on things too much.\\
404 - What?!
Now, now, now.\\
405 - I won't say that Lucy was right,\\
406 - but I'm getting tired of hearing that
story myself,\\
407 - and I think the thing for you to do\\
408 - is to go up there and apologize.\\
409 - Apologize?!\\
410 - Why?\\
411 - Well, because it's your fault as much
as hers,\\
412 - and because you'll never be happy\\
413 - till you and Lucy make up,\\
414 - and because I'm hungry.\\
415 - Well...\\
416 - maybe if she apologizes to me first,\\
417 - why, then maybe I'll apologize to
her.\\
418 - Well, that's better.\\
419 - Now come on.\\
420 - Don't push me!\\
421 - Lucy, for the last time,\\
422 - are you going to get on that phone
and call Ethel?\\
423 - No!\\
424 - All right, then you're going to go\\
425 - right downstairs and apologize.
Come on.\\
426 - No. Now, Ricky, stop.
Come on.\\
427 - Lucy...\\
428 - I apologize.\\
429 - Ethel?\\
430 - So do I.\\
431 - You really mean it?\\
432 - Yes, I really do.\\
433 - Do you?\\
434 - Yes, I do, Ethel.\\
435 - Oh, I'm sorry, Lucy.\\
436 - So am I.\\
437 - Okay, let's eat.\\
438 - Yeah, come on, let's eat.\\
439 - Okay. What say we all eat up here
together?\\
440 - Fine. Let's eat here, fine.\\
441 - Wonderful. I'll fix something.\\
442 - All right, go ahead.
Cook the dinner.\\
443 - Fine, fine.\\
444 - Good deal.\\
445 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
446 - What a pair.\\
447 - Yeah.\\
448 - You know, they'd die without each
other.\\
449 - Yeah, you know something?\\
450 - Lucy was right.\\
451 - No. Ethel was right.\\
452 - Listen, listen, Ethel was harping on
that story\\
453 - till even I was sick.\\
454 - Well... I guess Ethel has the habit\\
455 - of staying on a subject until it gets
sickening.\\
456 - What do you mean, "sickening"?\\
457 - Well, you know what I mean, Fred.\\
458 - You just said yourself\\
459 - that sometimes you get sick of her.\\
460 - Well, I'm supposed to get sick of
her.\\
461 - She's my wife.\\
462 - Well, you don't have to get upset
about it, Fred.\\
463 - I was just agreeing with you.\\
464 - Well, agree with me\\
465 - without making cracks about Ethel.\\
466 - Well, I'm sorry, Fred.\\
467 - You don't see me taking potshots at
Lucy,\\
468 - although heaven knows I'm loaded with
ammunition.\\
469 - And what do you mean by that?\\
470 - I mean I'd rather be married\\
471 - to a blabbermouth than an ingrate.\\
472 - Ingrate?!\\
473 - You don't even know what it means.\\
474 - It doesn't matter.\\
475 - I don't like the way you looked when
you said that.\\
476 - Ingrate!\\
477 - Tu lo que un viejo muy atrevido,\\
478 - muy bruto y muy sinverguenza!\\
479 - Oh, now, listen, you Cuban crumb!\\
480 - Oh, I'd better get out of here\\
481 - before I bust your nose.\\
482 - Yeah, well, I'd like to see you try
it!\\
483 - Break you in pieces!\\
484 - You and who else?!\\
485 - I'll massacre you!\\
486 - (both shouting)\\
487 - They're fighting!\\
488 - What about?\\
489 - (Little Ricky crying)\\
490 - Mrs. Ricardo.\\
491 - Mrs. Ricardo!\\
492 - Mrs. Ricardo!\\
493 - Come on now.
Come on now, then.\\
494 - Go ahead now, Fred, apologize.\\
495 - Tell Fred you're sorry, Ricky.\\
496 - Oh...\\
497 - Why don't you apologize together?\\
498 - Look, now you say\\
499 - "I'm sorry, Fred,"\\
500 - and you say, "I'm sorry, Ricky."\\
501 - Now, I'll conduct.\\
502 - One, two, three.\\
503 - I'm sorry, Ricky.
I'm sorry, Fred.\\
504 - There you are!\\
505 - You see?\\
506 - That wasn't so hard.\\
507 - I'm glad that's over.\\
508 - I didn't mean it\\
509 - when I called you a Cuban crumb.\\
510 - That's all right, Fred.\\
511 - I didn't mean it when I called you\\
512 - un viejo sinverguenza, atrevido y
bruto.\\
513 - Yeah, that's all right, too, but what
does it mean?\\
514 - If I told you,\\
515 - we'd start fighting all over again.\\
516 - (all laughing)\\
517 - You know, for four grown-up people,\\
518 - we've been acting pretty childish.\\
519 - Yeah, we're bigger babies than Little
Ricky.\\
520 - Little Ricky!\\
521 - We left him alone!\\
522 - Oh, no!\\
523 - Oh, thank goodness he isn't crying.\\
524 - Shh, shh.\\
525 - Mrs. Trumbull!\\
526 - Mrs. Ricardo, you should be ashamed
of yourself--\\
527 - running off and leaving this poor,
little child alone.\\
528 - Don't you worry, dear.\\
529 - You'll always have me around\\
530 - to see that nobody leaves you alone
again.\\

1 - (I Love Lucy theme song playing)\\
2 - (sighs)\\
3 - Honey, I think that tomorrow...\\
4 - (whispering): Please!\\
5 - (baby cries briefly)\\
6 - (gurgling)\\
7 - (both sighing)\\
8 - (whispering): I'm sorry, honey, I
didn't mean...\\
9 - What's the matter with you?\\
10 - Are you crazy or something?\\
11 - You want the baby to keep us awake
again tonight?\\
12 - I'm sorry, dear, I guess I wasn't
thinking.\\
13 - If I don't get some sleep soon,\\
14 - I don't know what I'm going to do.\\
15 - Well, honey, we'll keep our fingers
crossed.\\
16 - Maybe we won't hear a peep out of him
tonight.\\
17 - Well, I hope not.\\
18 - And, honey, listen, if he does wake
up,\\
19 - I'd certainly appreciate it if you'd
get up and take care of him.\\
20 - Sure, honey, I will.
Okay.\\
21 - Come on, let's go to bed.\\
22 - What?!\\
23 - Oh, Ricky, I'm simply asking if the
baby wake up\\
24 - that you get up and take care of him.\\
25 - Well, honey, I know it's a lot of
hard work taking care of the baby,\\
26 - but that's what mothers are for.\\
27 - Oh, and what are fathers for?\\
28 - Well, the father is the breadwinner.\\
29 - See, the father is supposed to get
his rest at night\\
30 - so he can get up fresh in the
morning, go out into the world\\
31 - and make money for his family.\\
32 - You wouldn't tell me the rules before
the game started.\\
33 - The next time we have a baby, I get
to be the father.\\
34 - Now, don't try to be funny.\\
35 - (tearfully): I'm not trying to be
funny.\\
36 - You just don't know how tired I am.\\
37 - You don't care anything about me.\\
38 - Oh, honey, I do, honestly I do.\\
39 - Then will you get up and take care of
him?\\
40 - Isn't there some kind of a
compromise?\\
41 - Look, I'll tell you what--\\
42 - will get up, keep him quiet so the
other one can sleep.\\
43 - Now, is that fair?\\
44 - All right, you got a deal.\\
45 - Okay.\\
46 - Come on, let's go to bed.\\
47 - (baby crying softly)\\
48 - (crying stops)\\
49 - (louder crying)\\
50 - (crying stops)\\
51 - (very loud crying)\\
52 - (both snore loudly)\\
53 - All right, you out-snored me, you big
phony.\\
54 - (crying continues)\\
55 - Shh, shh, shh.\\
56 - It's all right, honey, it's all
right.\\
57 - It's all right, baby.\\
58 - That's okay, that's okay, honey.\\
59 - (crying continues)\\
60 - Shh.\\
61 - (alarm clock ringing)\\
62 - Lucy!\\
63 - Lucy, honey, wake up!\\
64 - What's the matter? Baby cry?\\
65 - Don't get up, dear, I'll get him.\\
66 - Honey, it's morning.\\
67 - Oh, oh.\\
68 - Straighten up.\\
69 - Uh... oh, I can't.\\
70 - Lower the side of the crib.\\
71 - Huh? Oh.\\
72 - (moaning)\\
73 - What time is it?\\
74 - It's 10:00.\\
75 - Oh, I got to get your breakfast.\\
76 - Hey, honey, wait. Honey!\\
77 - Honey, please don't...
don't worry about my breakfast.\\
78 - Come on, you got to get some rest.\\
79 - All right.\\
80 - Listen, tonight I'm going to make
sure\\
81 - you go to bed real early.\\
82 - Oh, no, we're going to play bridge
with the Mertzes.\\
83 - Oh, no, no, I'll call that off.\\
84 - Oh, no, don't do that, that's all the
fun I have.\\
85 - I'll be all right.\\
86 - All I need is a little sleep.\\
87 - All I ask...\\
88 - Well, are you all set to play...\\
89 - RICKY: Honey, I don't seem to be able
to find\\
90 - the card...\\
91 - No use trying to play tonight.\\
92 - No.
She's really bushed, isn't she?\\
93 - Yes. I guess taking care of the house
and the baby\\
94 - is a little bit too much for her.\\
95 - Well, taking care of a little baby's
no easy job.\\
96 - Well... You know what I was thinking,
Ethel?\\
97 - What?\\
98 - I ought to get Lucy a maid.\\
99 - A maid? Oh, Ricky, that's wonderful.\\
100 - Well, it's a big expense, but she
can't go on this way.\\
101 - So you're thinking of getting Lucy a
maid, huh?\\
102 - Hey, that idea might be a good thing
for us, too.\\
103 - Why, Fred, are you thinking of
getting me a maid?\\
104 - Nope. I'm thinking of hiring you out
to the Ricardos.\\
105 - Lucy, honey...\\
106 - wake up.\\
107 - (shouting): Three, no trump!\\
108 - We haven't started playing yet.\\
109 - Oh, hi.\\
110 - Hi.
Hi.\\
111 - And, honey, you know what we just
decided?\\
112 - I'm going to get you a maid.\\
113 - ETHEL: Isn't that wonderful, Lucy? A
maid!\\
114 - I must still be asleep.\\
115 - I thought you said you were going to
get me a maid.\\
116 - I did, honey.
You can't go on this way.\\
117 - You need some help.\\
118 - Oh, Ricky, you're the most wonderful
husband in the world!\\
119 - Oh, honey!\\
120 - Gee, just think, honey,\\
121 - this is the last breakfast I'll ever
have to serve.\\
122 - What time is the first maid coming
out?\\
123 - Well, the agency said she'd be here
about 10:00.\\
124 - What do you mean, the first maid?\\
125 - Well, honey, you have to talk to
three or four of them\\
126 - before you can decide.\\
127 - Oh, anybody the agency sends out
ought to be all right.\\
128 - Now, wait a minute, honey.\\
129 - I don't want you to get started
wrong.\\
130 - I want you to handle this like a real
businesswoman.\\
131 - Well...\\
132 - You got to ask her questions, find
out something about her.\\
133 - Oh, I don't know.\\
134 - Honey, why don't you stay around and
interview her?\\
135 - Well, I can't, honey.\\
136 - I got to go to rehearsal.\\
137 - Well, I've never interviewed one
before.\\
138 - What do I ask her?\\
139 - Well, you got to ask her, uh...\\
140 - where she worked before,\\
141 - why she left,\\
142 - if she's a good cook, if she knows
how to serve...\\
143 - if she's got a catcher's mitt.\\
144 - Well, couldn't I just hire her,\\
145 - and hope that everything works out
all right?\\
146 - Now, now, now, wait a minute.\\
147 - The most important thing in hiring
anybody\\
148 - is to establish the relationship\\
149 - right from the start.
Oh.\\
150 - You've got to be firm.\\
151 - Let her know who's working for who.\\
152 - Oh.
Yeah, don't give her too much time
off.\\
153 - Make sure she understands\\
154 - what her hours are and what her
duties are.\\
155 - Be tough.\\
156 - Well, I better go.\\
157 - I'll call you later, see how you made
out.\\
158 - Okay.
Bye.\\
159 - (no sound)\\
160 - Hey...
(screaming)\\
161 - Oh, Ethel.\\
162 - I was practicing interviewing the
maid.\\
163 - Oh.\\
164 - Ricky said that I should be firm with
her.\\
165 - Well, what are you going to say?\\
166 - Well, I... Here, you be the maid.\\
167 - Now, first, I want to get a look at
you.\\
168 - Eh.\\
169 - Now, I want you to understand just
what kind of a job this is.\\
170 - It's no cinch.\\
171 - You'll cook and clean, do the laundry
and the ironing\\
172 - and help take care of the baby.\\
173 - You'll have Thursdays off and Sunday
afternoons only.\\
174 - I expect you here at 8:00 in the
morning\\
175 - and you mustn't leave until after
8:30 at night.\\
176 - Do you understand?\\
177 - Hey, that was good, you were real
firm.\\
178 - Well, it's the only way.\\
179 - You see, you have to establish the
relationship\\
180 - right from the start.\\
181 - (door buzzer)\\
182 - There she is.\\
183 - Well, I'll see you later. Now, be
firm.\\
184 - Yeah.\\
185 - (door buzzer)\\
186 - Good morning, I am from the
employment agency.\\
187 - Are you Mrs. Ricardo?\\
188 - Yes.\\
189 - Uh, there are a few things that I
think that...\\
190 - First there are some things that I
think we should discuss.\\
191 - That's right.\\
192 - Now, I must have Wednesday afternoons
off\\
193 - and every weekend.\\
194 - I can't possibly come before 9:00 in
the morning,\\
195 - and I must leave before 7:00 at
night.\\
196 - Oh.\\
197 - Of course, you have an automatic
dishwasher?\\
198 - No, we don't.\\
199 - A dryer?\\
200 - No.\\
201 - Uh, but we have a...
we have a garbage disposal\\
202 - and a washing machine.\\
203 - Well...\\
204 - And a television set, 21-inch screen.\\
205 - I'll take the job.\\
206 - Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.\\
207 - May I help you off with your coat?\\
208 - Yes.\\
209 - Oh, that's a very pretty hat.\\
210 - Yes. Well, now I'll see what I've
gotten myself into.\\
211 - Oh, yes, go right ahead.\\
212 - Just don't wake up the baby.\\
213 - Baby?!\\
214 - Well, he's just a little one.\\
215 - He, he really isn't very much
trouble.\\
216 - -Who takes care of him?
-I do?\\
217 - Including his laundry?\\
218 - Oh, yes, yes, I do everything for
him.\\
219 - I take full charge of the baby,
always.\\
220 - Oh, well, that's all right.\\
221 - Yes.\\
222 - Where's the kitchen?\\
223 - In there.\\
224 - Oh, I forgot, what is your name?\\
225 - Mrs. Porter.\\
226 - Oh, and what do I call you?\\
227 - Mrs. Porter.\\
228 - (phone rings)\\
229 - Ricardos' residence.\\
230 - Huh? Just a minute.\\
231 - Are you in to a Mrs. Mertz?\\
232 - Ask her which Mrs. Mertz.\\
233 - Which Mrs. Mertz?\\
234 - The one you owe two months' rent to.\\
235 - Hello, Ethel.\\
236 - Oh, this is Mrs. Mertz' scullery
girl.\\
237 - I'll ask the downstairs maid to ask
the upstairs maid\\
238 - if madame can talk to you.\\
239 - All right, all right.\\
240 - How you doing?\\
241 - Well, it isn't exactly\\
242 - the way I dreamed about it.\\
243 - What's the matter?\\
244 - Oh, I'll come down later and tell you
about it.\\
245 - She's fixing my lunch now.\\
246 - Fixing your lunch?\\
247 - That doesn't sound bad.\\
248 - Well, I think maybe it'll work out
all right.\\
249 - I'll be down later. Good-bye.\\
250 - Lunch is ready.\\
251 - Oh, all right.\\
252 - Well, you don't want me to bring it
in there, do you?\\
253 - Oh. Oh, no, of course not.\\
254 - I'll eat in the kit... uh, in the
breakfast nook.\\
255 - What's the matter?\\
256 - Don't you like peanut butter
sandwiches?\\
257 - Oh, yes. Yes, I like them very much
as a rule, but...\\
258 - I tell you what, I think I'd rather
have\\
259 - some of that roast beef that's in the
refrigerator.\\
260 - That snivelly little leftover?\\
261 - Why, there was half a roast...\\
262 - Oh, yeah, that was the one.\\
263 - Why, it hardly made a good mouthful.\\
264 - Well, there's a head of lettuce, if I
could...\\
265 - If I didn't have the salad, I'd have
starved to death.\\
266 - There's some jelly up in the...\\
267 - All gone?\\
268 - Some milk?\\
269 - All gone?\\
270 - Well, I've got to eat, too, you know.\\
271 - Oh, I know, I know.\\
272 - Yes, of course, surely.\\
273 - That's the way to eat a peanut butter
sandwich.\\
274 - That's what's good for you--\\
275 - a nice, pure\\
276 - thick peanut butter on dry bread.\\
277 - Good, huh?\\
278 - I'll make you another one.\\
279 - (knocking on door)\\
280 - Hi.\\
281 - Oh, pardon my answering the door\\
282 - dressed like this, your highness.\\
283 - If you'll excuse me, I'll go put on a
formal gown.\\
284 - Oh, shut up.\\
285 - What's the matter?\\
286 - Oh, Ethel, let's face it, I'm not the
type to have a maid.\\
287 - Some people are cut out for champagne
and caviar.\\
288 - I'm more the beer and pretzel type.\\
289 - What's the matter?
What happened?\\
290 - Oh, she walks all over me.\\
291 - She gets most of the time off, I have
to take care of the baby,\\
292 - I have to do his laundry,\\
293 - and she's eating me out of house and
home.\\
294 - What am I going to do?\\
295 - That's easy, fire her.\\
296 - Fire her? Oh, I don't know.\\
297 - Well, you certainly can't keep her.\\
298 - You just said you're not the type to
have a maid.\\
299 - Well, I'm not the type to fire one,
either.\\
300 - Lucy Ricardo, are you afraid of the
maid?\\
301 - Afraid? Me?\\
302 - Yes!\\
303 - Lucy, you go right up there and fire
her.\\
304 - Come on, now, who's the boss?\\
305 - You or her?\\
306 - I am.\\
307 - Who gives the orders?\\
308 - I do.\\
309 - Well, are you going to let someone,\\
310 - a stranger, someone you pay money to,
boss you around?\\
311 - I should say not!\\
312 - Well, what are you going to do about
it?\\
313 - I'm going to go right up there\\
314 - and tell her she's through right now.\\
315 - I'll show her who's the boss.\\
316 - She's got a lot of nerve.\\
317 - Mrs. Porter.\\
318 - Yes?\\
319 - May I see you for a moment?\\
320 - Mrs. Porter, there's something I'd
like to say to you.\\
321 - Well?\\
322 - Uh, could I have glass of water,
please?\\
323 - Thank you.\\
324 - Mrs. Porter!\\
325 - Well?\\
326 - Could I have some more water, please?\\
327 - Well, you haven't finished that.\\
328 - Oh.\\
329 - I guess I'm kind of thirsty from all
that peanut butter.\\
330 - (laughing weakly)\\
331 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
332 - How's my lady of leisure?\\
333 - All rested up, huh?\\
334 - No.\\
335 - Why, what's the matter?\\
336 - I don't like having a maid.\\
337 - I'm just not cut out for it, Ricky.\\
338 - I feel like I'm working for her.\\
339 - That's worse than doing all the work
myself.\\
340 - Well, we only got her\\
341 - because we thought it was going to be
good for you.\\
342 - If you don't like her, we'll let her
go.\\
343 - We'll fire her, huh?\\
344 - Sure.\\
345 - Good. I'll go down and see Ethel,\\
346 - and after you fire her, call me.\\
347 - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\\
348 - Wait a minute, wait a minute.\\
349 - This is your project-- you hire her,
you fire her.\\
350 - Oh, I tried to and I couldn't.\\
351 - Well, why not?\\
352 - I got waterlogged.\\
353 - Huh?\\
354 - You'll do it for me, won't you,
Ricky?\\
355 - Honey, I haven't even met her.\\
356 - Well, that's perfect.
I'll introduce you.\\
357 - I'll say, "Mrs. Porter, this is my
husband."\\
358 - You say, "How do you do?
You're fired."\\
359 - Now don't be silly.\\
360 - I told you I want you to run this
house like a business.\\
361 - Well, if you're afraid...\\
362 - Me? Afraid?\\
363 - (laughing)\\
364 - Why, I could go in there right now
and fire her just like that.\\
365 - Well, go ahead.\\
366 - I will, I'll tell her, go right in
there now.\\
367 - That's telling her.\\
368 - Well, I was waiting for you to
introduce me.\\
369 - Oh, sure.\\
370 - Besides, if we don't lower our
voices,\\
371 - nobody will have to tell her-- she'll
hear us.\\
372 - Hey... hey, that's it.\\
373 - What?
Um...\\
374 - (loudly): It's too bad,\\
375 - but I think we're going to have to
let Mrs. Porter go!\\
376 - Did you say we have to let Mrs.
Porter go?!\\
377 - Yes, I'm going to let her go right
after dinner!\\
378 - It just isn't working out.\\
379 - Well, I guess you have to let Mrs.
Porter go, then.\\
380 - Yes. Um, I'm going to let her go,\\
381 - but I'm going to give her a good
recommendation\\
382 - and a week's pay.
A whole week.\\
383 - A good recommendation.\\
384 - A week's pay.\\
385 - A good recommendation!\\
386 - (door buzzer)\\
387 - (no sound)\\
388 - Mrs. Porter, what are you doing here?\\
389 - I went out to empty some trash and
the back door locked me out.\\
390 - I knocked, but with all that yelling,
nobody could hear me.\\
391 - You must have had some fight.\\
392 - Hi.\\
393 - Hi.\\
394 - What's the matter?\\
395 - Oh, I can't stand it upstairs with
that maid,\\
396 - and I haven't got the nerve to fire
her.\\
397 - Well, somebody's got to fire her.\\
398 - Yeah.\\
399 - Ethel, will you...\\
400 - No!\\
401 - Guess there's not much chance that
she'll quit, huh?\\
402 - With an easy job like that, why
should she quit?\\
403 - Yeah.\\
404 - Hey, wait a minute-- what if she
didn't have such an easy job?\\
405 - What if she had to work her head off
cleaning up all the time?\\
406 - Yeah.\\
407 - How can we make my apartment look
like a pigpen?\\
408 - Oh, that's easy-- let Fred stay there
for a while.\\
409 - No, come on, now, help me, what can
we do?\\
410 - Well, let's see...
I could have Fred\\
411 - bring up a lot of junk from the
basement.\\
412 - Tell him to bring up everything
that's messy.\\
413 - Okay.
Let's see, then we have to wait\\
414 - until Mrs. Porter goes marketing,\\
415 - and then we'll mess the place up.\\
416 - And after she gets it all cleaned up,\\
417 - we'll say we get it that dirty every
day.\\
418 - That ought to do it.\\
419 - That ought to do it, yes, sir.\\
420 - Oh, hurry up. Come on!\\
421 - (laughing)\\
422 - How does it look?\\
423 - Oh, boy, that's beginning to look
good.\\
424 - How you doing in the kitchen?\\
425 - Oh, fine.\\
426 - I made a paste out of peanut butter\\
427 - and mustard and molasses\\
428 - and I smeared it over everything out
there.\\
429 - Oh, this I got to see.\\
430 - Come on and look at it.\\
431 - I really did a fine job, wait till
you see it.\\
432 - Oh, no, oh... oh, Ethel.\\
433 - Isn't that great?\\
434 - Oh, I wouldn't believe it if I didn't
see it.\\
435 - Oh, look at that.\\
436 - Oh!\\
437 - Well, let's see now.\\
438 - We forget anything?\\
439 - Well, we could always throw a dead
horse in the corner.\\
440 - (laughing)\\
441 - Hey, hey!
What?\\
442 - I found these old feather pillows.
Here.\\
443 - What are they for?
What are they for?\\
444 - Why, to spread the feathers around,
of course.\\
445 - How do you go about doing that?\\
446 - Well, there's only one way.\\
447 - Oh!\\
448 - Hey, what's going on here?\\
449 - Hey, are you crazy or something?\\
450 - What are you doing?\\
451 - It's a scheme to make Mrs. Porter
quit.\\
452 - Oh, no.\\
453 - What's the matter?\\
454 - Well, I felt sorry for you,\\
455 - so I called her up an hour ago and I
fired her.\\

49 - All those Indians\\
50 - you used to have in this country.\\

56 - I thought you meant like in that song\\
57 - "Curdle Up a Little Closer."\\

kitchen\\
73 - that needs fixing.\\
74 - All right, okay, okay.\\

116 - Hi, Fred.
Hi, Lucy.\\
117 - Oh, Lucy.
What?\\
118 - I was just telling Fred\\
119 - that since you had the baby\\
120 - the thought of being in show business\\
121 - has completely left your mind.\\
122 - Hasn't it?\\
123 - Yup, it's gone.\\
124 - See, she doesn't care anything about
the new show.\\
125 - New show?\\
126 - What do I do?\\
127 - I thought it had left your mind.\\
128 - Well, it had, but you opened the door\\
129 - and it flew right back in.\\
130 - Oh, no.
Ricky, what'll I do?\\
131 - What'll I do, sing?
No.\\
132 - Dance?
No.\\
133 - Tell jokes?
No.\\
134 - Play my saxophone?
No.\\
135 - Walk around, look beautiful like a
show girl?\\
136 - (humming)\\
137 - Down, girl.\\
138 - (continues humming)
Down, girl.\\
139 - Down, girl!\\
140 - Little mother...\\
141 - Now, Ricky, it's been a long time\\
142 - since I even asked you to be in one
of your shows.\\
143 - Yes, I remember the last time\\
144 - and you said it was going to be your
swan song.\\
145 - Well, it's time for that swan\\
146 - to hit the comeback trail.\\
147 - That swan's got a little ham in it.\\
148 - You keep out of this.\\
149 - Look, I want you to understand this.\\
150 - You cannot be in this show\\
151 - or in any other show.\\
152 - Give me one good reason.\\
153 - I'll give you one good reason.\\
154 - You're a mother.\\
155 - I have just as much talent now\\
156 - as I had before the baby was born.\\
157 - That makes two good reasons.\\
158 - (baby crying)\\
159 - Your public is waiting for you in
there.\\
160 - Oh.\\
161 - I guess I better call up and cancel
those auditions, huh?\\
162 - What's the show about?\\
163 - Never mind!\\
164 - Ay-ay-ay.\\
165 - (no audio)\\
166 - (high-pitched whistling)\\
167 - What's the matter?\\
168 - What?\\
169 - What's the matter?\\
170 - Matter?\\
171 - Oh, nothing, dear.\\
172 - I'm just sitting here.\\
173 - What's new?\\
174 - I'm going down to the club.\\
175 - Oh, nothing, nothing.\\
176 - I'm all right.\\
177 - Good-bye, dear.\\
178 - Oh, that's nice.\\
179 - Oh, are you leaving?\\
180 - Good-bye.\\
181 - Fred, I'm going to go down to the
club\\
182 - and call Jerry and tell him\\
183 - to switch the auditions down there.\\
184 - Hey, I got a great joke you can use.\\
185 - Yeah?
Yeah.\\
186 - Do you know the one about the Indian\\
187 - that had to sleep in the hotel lobby\\
188 - because he didn't have a reservation?\\
189 - No.\\
190 - How does it go?\\
191 - Never mind, you wouldn't like it.\\
192 - Hi.
(screams)\\
193 - (both screaming)\\
194 - Oh, my...\\
195 - Don't ever do that!\\
196 - Are you crazy?\\
197 - Oh, you startled me.\\
198 - I was reading this book.\\
199 - Well, it must be some book.\\
200 - Let me see it.\\
201 - Good night!\\
202 - Blood-Curdling Indian Tales.\\
203 - Oh, you're reading more sophisticated
stuff these days,\\
204 - aren't you?\\
205 - Those were very exciting times.\\
206 - I-I'm glad I didn't live in them.\\
207 - Listen-- listen to this.\\
208 - "Then the silhouettes of the Indians
appeared on the horizon.\\
209 - "The pioneer men pushed the women and
children\\
210 - back into the wagons."\\
211 - Imagine being alone out on the
prairie\\
212 - thousands of miles away from any
help.\\
213 - Oh, yeah.
Imagine that.\\
214 - "The Indians crept closer and closer.\\
215 - "Fire-tipped arrows pierced the
canvas of the first wagon.\\
216 - "Women fainted.\\
217 - "Children screamed.\\
218 - "The Indians were almost upon them.\\
219 - "They could see their fiendish faces
hideously painted--\\
220 - "grotesque in the light of the
leaping flames.\\
221 - "There was a lull as the last groans
of the dying men faded.\\
222 - "Suddenly to the ears of the cowering
women and children,\\
223 - "out of the stillness of the night,\\
224 - broke the sound of an Indian war
cry."\\
225 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
226 - (screams)\\
227 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
228 - Oh.\\
229 - It's just the doorbell.\\
230 - Oh, I was really gone.\\
231 - I'm telling you, these things can
really...\\
232 - (shrieking): Ethel!\\
233 - Ethel!\\
234 - My baby, my baby!\\
235 - Oh, Lucy.\\
236 - My baby! There are wild Indians out
there!\\
237 - Wild Indians!\\
238 - Your imagination has run away with
you.\\
239 - We're surrounded!
We're being attacked!\\
240 - Indians! Don't open the door, Ethel.\\
241 - They'll scalp us.\\
242 - Lucy...
wait a minute.\\
243 - I never thought I'd see you crack up.\\
244 - (screams)\\
245 - What do we do?!
What do we do?!\\
246 - Barricade the door!\\
247 - (both shouting at once)\\
248 - (no audio)\\
249 - Oh, he's a big one.\\
250 - We better get the...\\
251 - Help!\\
252 - Fred! Indians! Look!\\
253 - Indians!\\
254 - They tried to scalp us!\\
255 - Wait a minute, wait a minute!
They tried to scalp us!\\
256 - What's... What's going...?\\
257 - They came right in on us.\\
258 - Are you dames balmy or something?\\
259 - No!\\
260 - These guys are actors.\\
261 - Actors?
ETHEL: Actors?!\\
262 - FRED: They're gonna be in Ricky's new
show.\\
263 - Eww...\\
264 - They should've gone down to the club.\\
265 - Why'd you slug 'em?\\
266 - What?\\
267 - Why'd you slug 'em?\\
268 - Why'd we slug 'em?\\
269 - ETHEL: Uh...\\
270 - Oh! Oh, oh, I was reading a book
about Indians,\\
271 - and right in the most exciting part
they came in\\
272 - and... we just got carried away.\\
273 - Well, if they're hurt, you might get
put away.\\
274 - Oh, let's see, then.\\
275 - Help him up, Fred.\\
276 - We'll help you up.\\
277 - Mr. Indian.\\
278 - There you are.

279 - There. You okay? You okay?

280 - Oh, uh, me heap sorry me smackum on

284 - What are youse trying to do, murder

285 - Oh, no. No, I'm terribly sorry.\\
286 - We thought you were someone else.\\
287 - Well, ain't this Ricardo's place?\\
288 - Yes, yes.\\
289 - Oh, and you're supposed to go down\\
290 - to the Tropicana club.\\
291 - Are you all right?\\
292 - Well... I guess we'll live.\\
293 - Man, these auditions\\
294 - are getting tougher every day.\\
295 - Listen, I'm Mrs. Ricardo\\
296 - and I promise\\
297 - that you'll both get the job if...\\
298 - if, uh, maybe you'll just forget
about this.\\
299 - Well, okay.\\
300 - Oh, thank you.\\
301 - Come on, Herman.\\
302 - Oh, they were real friendly Indians.\\
303 - Yeah.\\
304 - So the show has an Indian theme, huh?\\
305 - FRED: Mm-hmm.\\
306 - Oh, hey, I played Hiawatha in a
school pageant once.\\
307 - "By the shores of Gitche Gumee\\
308 - by the, by the shining-big-sea water,
stood the wigwam of..."\\
309 - Ethel, will you stay with the baby
while I go to rehearsal?\\
310 - No, she won't.\\
311 - Why won't I?\\
312 - Well, 'cause Ricky just called\\
313 - and he wants us to come down at the
club.\\
314 - He's got a job for us in the new
show.\\
315 - He has?
On, that's wonderful.\\
316 - I'm sorry, Lucy.\\
317 - I'll see you later.\\
318 - Oh, yeah, maybe you will.\\
319 - Huh?\\
320 - Well, I might just stroll down to the
club\\
321 - with the baby this afternoon.\\
322 - Stroll down?\\
323 - It's miles down there.\\
324 - Oh, yeah, I guess you're right.\\
325 - It's too far.\\
326 - Well, so long.\\
327 - Bye.
Bye.\\
328 - (imitating Indian singing)\\
329 - All right, all right, all right, all
right.\\
330 - That's pretty good for that step.\\
331 - Now, let's take the whole thing from
the top.\\
332 - Oh, no.
Oh, wait a minute, Rick.\\
333 - I couldn't do it again, Ricky.
My back's broke.\\
334 - I'm too tired.
I've had it.\\
335 - I couldn't go through with it.\\
336 - Well, you characters,\\
337 - you want to be in show business and
you don't want to rehearse.\\
338 - Oh, my feet.
Why don't you get a whip?\\
339 - All right, okay, you go over the
table and rest for awhile.\\
340 - I'll try the other number.\\
341 - Pepin, you go take a smoke.
Go ahead.\\
342 - All right, let's try the, uh...
"The Waters of the Minnetonka."\\
343 - Is that the number?
That's right, all right.\\
344 - I want to try the moon effect, too,\\
345 - so get ready with the light, boys.\\
346 - Juanita, you ready?\\
347 - Okay, Rick.\\
348 - Marco, ready?\\
349 - Here we go.\\

390 - That's great.\\
391 - You like it, huh?\\
392 - Good.\\
393 - FRED: All right.\\
394 - Listen, take it easy going down
there.\\
395 - ETHEL: I love those repeats, that was
very...\\
396 - That's my favorite...
my favorite part.\\
397 - Watch it now. This is kind of tricky\\
398 - getting out of here, you know.\\
399 - ETHEL: Your voice sounds wonderful,
Juanita.\\
400 - Thank you.\\
401 - That's nice.
That's nice, boys.\\
402 - Nice and soft like that.\\
403 - Now, listen, we've got a lot of work
to do\\
404 - because we've got to open this thing
tomorrow afternoon.\\
405 - ALL: Tomorrow afternoon?\\
406 - That's right.\\
407 - Whoever heard of nightclub opening in
the afternoon?\\
408 - Well, the place is sold for a
benefit--\\
409 - a women's club benefit.\\
410 - Besides, it'll give us a good chance\\
411 - to break in the act.\\
412 - Gee, Ricky, that's the only time I've
got\\
413 - to spend with my baby.\\
414 - RICKY: Well, honey, you'll make some
extra money.\\
415 - You can buy the kid\\
416 - a defense bond, all right?\\
417 - Okay.
All right.\\
418 - Now, let's see.\\
419 - What kind of an act can I get to fill
in\\
420 - while I change my costume\\
421 - for that peace pipe number?\\
422 - Well...\\
423 - "By the shores of Gitche Gumee,\\
424 - "by the shining big-sea-water,\\
425 - "stood the wigwam of Nokomis\\
426 - "daughter of the moon, Nokomis.\\
427 - "Bright before it beats the water,\\
428 - "beats the clear and sunny water,\\
429 - "beats the shining big-sea-water.\\
430 - "Dark before it loomed the forest,\\
431 - "loomed the black and gloomy pine
trees,\\
432 - "loomed the fir with cones upon them.\\
433 - "There the wrinkled old Nokomis\\
434 - nursed the little Hiawatha."\\
435 - As I was saying\\
436 - what kind of an act can I get...?\\
437 - Now, Ricky.\\
438 - Look, you know what my answer is\\
439 - and I don't want to hear another word
about it.\\
440 - But, honey, you didn't even give me a
chance\\
441 - to show you what I can really do.\\
442 - Well, why don't you leave your name
and address\\
443 - with the secretary.\\
444 - Come on, let's check our costume.
Let's go.\\
445 - We got a lot of work.
Let's get moving here.\\
446 - Juanita.\\
447 - Juanita, it sure is a shame you can't
spend\\
448 - any time with your baby tomorrow
afternoon.\\
449 - I-I know just how you feel\\
450 - now that we have a child.
Uh-huh.\\
451 - Wouldn't it be wonderful\\
452 - if we could figure out some way that
the show could go on\\
453 - and you could still spend time with
your baby?\\
454 - It would be terrific.\\
455 - Well, now, if we just put our heads
together,\\
456 - I'm sure that we're going to be able
to figure out...\\
457 - (conga drums playing)\\
458 - Ug!\\
459 - A medicine man I met\\
460 - Said don't get yourself in a sweat\\
461 - BOTH: When things go wrong just shrug
and say...\\
462 - (horn section playing)\\
463 - It must've been something I et.\\
464 - ALL: Hey, if your temper is getting
in the top hat\\
465 - All you got to do is just stop and\\
466 - Pass that peace pipe and bury that
tomahawk.\\
467 - BAND: Like those Choctaws, Cherokees
and Chippewas do.\\
468 - If you're feeling mad as a wet hen\\
469 - Mad as you can possibly get\\
470 - FRED: Then pass that peace pipe, bury
that tomahawk\\
471 - Like those Choctaws, Cherokees and
Chippewas do.\\
472 - (music)\\
473 - Don't be cranky\\
474 - Give yourself a little restraint\\
475 - Fold that hanky\\
476 - ALL: And wash off all that war paint\\
477 - And if you find yourself in a fury\\
478 - Be your own judge, don't land in no
jury\\
479 - Pass that peace pipe and bury that
tomahawk\\
480 - Like those Seminoles, chewchews,
babalus do\\
481 - Like those Choctaws, Cherokees and
Chippewas do.\\
482 - Ug!\\
483 - Whoo, whoo, whoo!\\
484 - Whoo, whoo, whoo!\\
485 - Whoo, whoo, whoo!\\
486 - How!\\
487 - (applause)\\
488 - Whoo, whoo, whoo!\\
489 - Gracias, gracias.\\
490 - Thank you very much, ladies.\\
491 - And now we'd like to give you our

\subsection {Episode 25: Lucy's Last Birthday}
1 - (I Love Lucy theme song playing)\\
2 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
3 - Oh, good morning, Mrs. Trumbull.\\
4 - Morning.\\
5 - Well!\\
6 - Happy birthday to you\\
7 - Happy birthday to you\\
8 - Happy birthday, Mrs. Ricardo\\
9 - Happy birthday to you.\\
10 - Well, thank you very much, Mrs.
Trumbull,\\
11 - but today isn't my birthday.\\
12 - It isn't?\\
13 - No.\\
14 - But I wrote the date down\\
15 - when the Mertzes gave you\\
16 - that birthday party last year.\\
17 - Can't understand\\
18 - how I could have made such a mistake.\\
19 - When is your birthday?\\
20 - Never.\\
21 - What?\\
22 - I had my last birthday a year ago
today.\\
23 - Oh.\\
24 - So you've reached that point.\\
25 - Mm-hmm.\\
26 - I know how you feel.\\
27 - I stopped having birthdays\\
28 - when I was your age.\\
29 - At least I think I was your age.\\
30 - How old are you?\\
31 - How old were you when you stopped?\\
32 - Well, my last birthday was my 29th.\\
33 - You were just my age.\\
34 - That's what I figured.\\
35 - I was 34 at the time.\\
36 - Well, if it isn't your birthday,\\
37 - I'll take back my song.\\
38 - Well, thank you very much.\\
39 - It was a very nice song,\\
40 - but I just don't want anything\\
41 - to remind me it's my birthday.\\
42 - Mrs. Trumbull, I'll have you know\\
43 - that Ricky never forgets my birthday.\\
44 - Why, this is the most important day
of the year to him.\\
45 - Well, that's nice.\\
46 - Really.\\
47 - RICKY: Lucy!\\
48 - Yes, dear?\\
49 - Have I got any clean handkerchiefs?\\
50 - Uh, in the top drawer.\\
51 - You just watch what a big fuss he
makes.\\
52 - Oh, hello, Mrs. Trumbull.\\
53 - Good morning, Mr. Ricardo.\\
54 - Honey, I'm in a hurry,\\
55 - so I'll eat breakfast on the way down
to the club.\\
56 - Good-bye.\\
57 - Bye.\\
58 - Bye.
Good-bye.\\
59 - What are you looking for, dear?\\
60 - Well, I got something for you.\\
61 - You have?\\
62 - Yeah.\\
63 - Oh, here it is.\\
64 - I broke the crystal to my watch.\\
65 - Will you take it to the jewelers for
me, please?\\
66 - Oh, sure, sure.\\
67 - Thanks.\\
68 - Well, he's probably going to buy my
present downtown today\\
69 - and he'll bring it home with him\\
70 - when he comes home to dinner tonight.\\
71 - Yes.\\
72 - Honey?
Oh, yes, dear?\\
73 - I almost forgot what day this is.\\
74 - You did?\\
75 - I got an extra rehearsal at the club,\\
76 - so I won't be able to be home for
dinner.\\
77 - Now, don't feel too bad, Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
78 - Remember, you wanted him\\
79 - to forget your birthday.\\
80 - Sure I wanted him to forget my
birthday,\\
81 - but he forgot my birthday!\\
82 - Hi, Rick, come on in.\\
83 - No, Fred, I'm in a hurry.\\
84 - Look, I just wanted to check.\\
85 - Did you order the cake?\\
86 - We certainly did.\\
87 - It's got pink roses and a great big
heart\\
88 - with "Happy Birthday, Lucy" written
right on top of it.\\
89 - Oh, gee, that's just wonderful.\\
90 - Oh, you should have seen her just
now.\\
91 - She was just about to cry\\
92 - because she thinks\\
93 - that I've forgotten her birthday.\\
94 - Well, we'll make up for it tonight\\
95 - and everybody said they could come.\\
96 - Let me see, there's the Orsattis,\\
97 - the Sedgwicks,\\
98 - the Morgans and the Van Blacks.\\
99 - Wonderful, wonderful.\\
100 - I got a big ringside table at the
club\\
101 - I'm getting all fixed up real pretty.\\
102 - And I wrote a special song just for
Lucy.\\
103 - A song?
Yeah.\\
104 - No kidding?
Yeah.\\
105 - Oh, great.\\
106 - Now, look, look, will you tell Ethel\\
107 - to keep it quiet?\\
108 - You mean old blabbermouth?\\
109 - Yeah.\\
110 - Don't worry, she won't say a word.\\
111 - Okay. I'll see you later, Fred.\\
112 - Thanks a lot.\\
113 - So long, Rick.
Bye.\\
114 - Oh, my dear, you mustn't brood\\
115 - because your husband acted that way.\\
116 - I'm not brooding.\\
117 - I'm really glad that Ricky forgot my
birthday.\\
118 - It's just that it makes him look so
bad in comparison\\
119 - to all my other friends\\
120 - who think enough of me to remember,\\
121 - like you and Ethel Mertz and all the
rest.\\
122 - Mrs. Trumbull...\\
123 - would you stay here with Little Ricky\\
124 - while I go downstairs for a while?\\
125 - Why, certainly I will.\\
126 - You know I...\\
127 - I guess I am feeling a little low
about Ricky\\
128 - and all the fuss that Ethel will make
over my birthday\\
129 - will kind of cheer me up a little,\\
130 - to say nothing of the nice present\\
131 - she has undoubtedly bought me.\\
132 - All right, I'll stay with the baby\\
133 - just as long as you want.\\
134 - Thank you.\\
135 - Now, don't rush.\\
136 - No, I won't, thanks.\\
137 - Oh. Oh, Ethel.\\
138 - Hi, Lucy.\\
139 - Hi.\\
140 - I was just coming down to see you.\\
141 - You were?\\
142 - Uh-huh.\\
143 - Why?\\
144 - Oh, I just wanted to say hello.\\
145 - Oh.\\
146 - Hello.\\
147 - Hello.\\
148 - What did you want to see me about?\\
149 - I brought up your mail.\\
150 - Oh, is that all?\\
151 - Yeah, there wasn't much\\
152 - for anybody today.\\
153 - I mean, there wasn't anything else on
your mind?\\
154 - Nope.\\
155 - No?\\
156 - Well, let's see what's in the mail.\\
157 - Oh... oh, this looks like a card of
some kind.\\
158 - You know, a happy- something-or-other
card.\\
159 - Isn't this exciting?\\
160 - What's the matter?\\
161 - Wasn't it exciting?\\
162 - Not unless you want to go to the
opening of Joe's Delicatessen.\\
163 - Oh.\\
164 - Well, guess I'd better be running
along.\\
165 - Oh, no.\\
166 - No, sit down.\\
167 - Let's chat.\\
168 - Okay.\\
169 - What's new?\\
170 - Oh, nothing.\\
171 - Nothing.\\
172 - What's new with you?\\
173 - Nothing.\\
174 - Not a thing.\\
175 - You know, I have a strange feeling\\
176 - that today is some special day or
something.\\
177 - You know, like I'd forgotten
something.\\
178 - Oh, I've had that feeling.\\
179 - Isn't it annoying?\\
180 - Yeah.\\
181 - What could it be?\\
182 - Well, it must be something important.\\
183 - (humming "Happy Birthday To You")\\
184 - (continues humming)\\
185 - (hums ending to "Happy Birthday To
You")\\
186 - Gee, I can't imagine what it could
be, Lucy.\\
187 - Oh!\\
188 - What?\\
189 - I got a date at the beauty parlor in
20 minutes.\\
190 - I got to get my hair fixed up for
tonight.\\
191 - Tonight?\\
192 - Um... yes, Fred and I are going to go
out\\
193 - with the head of his lodge to dinner.\\
194 - Oh, that's nice.\\
195 - Well, so long, Lucy.\\
196 - Good-bye.\\
197 - (whimpering)\\
198 - Oh, didn't Mrs. Mertz\\
199 - remember your birthday either?\\
200 - She sure didn't.\\
201 - In fact, she made Ricky's "didn't"
look like a "did."\\
202 - (hiccups)\\
203 - Here, now,\\
204 - you just have a good, good cry.\\
205 - Well, crying won't do any good.\\
206 - It won't change things any.\\
207 - (hiccups)\\
208 - Oh, fine, now I got the hiccups.\\
209 - Try holding your breath; that ought
to stop them.\\
210 - No. That never does any good.\\
211 - I always get the hiccups when I cry.\\
212 - Ever since I was a little (hiccup)
girl.\\
213 - Well, hold your breath for 20
seconds, that'll stop it.\\
214 - It never does any good.\\
215 - Oh, yes, it will.\\
216 - Come on, I'll prove it to you now.
Let's try.\\
217 - All right.\\
218 - Now, when I say "go,"\\
219 - you take a deep, long breath.\\
220 - All right.\\
221 - Go.\\
222 - (inhales)\\
223 - Not yet.\\
224 - Not yet.\\
225 - 20 seconds is a long time.\\
226 - People don't realize how long it is.\\
227 - Well, this watch isn't even going.\\
228 - (hiccups)\\
229 - Oh!\\
230 - Well, anyway,\\
231 - it made you forget your troubles.\\
232 - It did not.\\
233 - You know what I'm going to do?\\
234 - What?\\
235 - I'm going to give myself a birthday
party.\\
236 - Now, that's a good idea.\\
237 - Will you come?\\
238 - I certainly will.\\
239 - It's going to be a gay party, too--\\
240 - everybody all dressed up, formal.\\
241 - Fine.\\
242 - I'm going to ask all my good
friends--\\
243 - the Orsattis, the Sedgwicks\\
244 - and the Morgans and the Van Blacks.\\
245 - I'll get my dress out of the trunk.\\
246 - It's been there so long, it's back in
style again.\\
247 - Oh, good.\\
248 - Say, have you ever met a girl who's
the toast of the town?\\
249 - A work of art without a question\\
250 - You better write her number down.\\
251 - Okay, boys, that's all right.\\
252 - Be sure you watch those last brass
figures there.\\
253 - Bite 'em off real good, eh?\\
254 - Now, let's have everything\\
255 - just right tonight, fellas.\\
256 - It's Lucy's birthday\\
257 - and I got a surprise party for her.\\
258 - I want everything to be perfect.\\
259 - Hey, Rick!\\
260 - Oh, hi, Fred.\\
261 - Everything's all set.\\
262 - Did you get the cake?\\
263 - Yeah... all right, bring it in.\\
264 - Did you ever see a cake like that in
your life?\\
265 - Oh, isn't that the most beautiful
thing you've ever seen?\\
266 - Isn't that a beauty?
Look at the candles.\\
267 - Oh, and that frosting.\\
268 - "Happy birthday, Lucy."\\
269 - Oh, she's going to get a big... mmm.\\
270 - She's going to get a big kick out of
that.\\
271 - Look at those colors, yeah.\\
272 - Isn't that beautiful?\\
273 - (Little Ricky fussing)\\
274 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
275 - Oh, Mrs. Trumbull.\\
276 - Well, I'm early, I see.\\
277 - Oh, dear, I forgot to call you.\\
278 - I couldn't get anyone\\
279 - to come to my party, Mrs. Trumbull.\\
280 - What do you mean you couldn't get
anyone to come? I'm here.\\
281 - Well...
Little Ricky's here.\\
282 - Why, we can have a wonderful party\\
283 - just the three of us.\\
284 - You can't have a real party\\
285 - without paper hats.\\
286 - There's one for you\\
287 - and... one for me...\\
288 - (giggling): and one for Little Ricky.\\
289 - Oh, he looks so cute.\\
290 - Well, um... now, let's throw some of
this around, give it a gay
atmosphere.\\
291 - Whee!\\
292 - Whee!\\
293 - Whee!\\
294 - Whee.\\
295 - (cries out)\\
296 - Oh... oh...\\
297 - Isn't this fun?\\
298 - Yeah, I guess so.\\
299 - Uh... I sure appreciate\\
300 - everything you've done, Mrs.
Trumbull.\\
301 - The cake and all, it's very nice.\\
302 - It's just that I guess\\
303 - I'm not much in a party mood.\\
304 - Mrs. Trumbull, would you stay\\
305 - with Little Ricky again?\\
306 - I'd like to take a walk.\\
307 - All right, dear, you go right ahead.\\
308 - Thank you.\\
309 - Don't you worry.\\
310 - I'll take care of Little Ricky, all
right.\\
311 - Okay, thank you.\\
312 - And hurry back so we can cut the
cake.\\
313 - Yeah.\\
314 - (telephone rings)\\
315 - Tropicana.\\
316 - TRUMBULL: I'd like to speak to Mr.
Ricardo, please.\\
317 - Mr. Ricardo?
Yes, he's around somewhere.\\
318 - Just a moment.\\
319 - Oh, Ricky.\\
320 - RICKY: Yeah?\\
321 - On the phone, please.\\
322 - Okay.\\
323 - Thank you.\\
324 - Hello.\\
325 - You ought to be ashamed of yourself.\\
326 - What?\\
327 - You... y-y-you man, you!\\
328 - Who is this?\\
329 - It's Mrs. Trumbull.\\
330 - Mrs. Trumbull!\\
331 - Thanks to you, your poor little wife
is crying her eyes out,\\
332 - and even now, she's walking the
streets brokenhearted.\\
333 - What are you talking about?\\
334 - Today happened to be your wife's
birthday.\\
335 - Oh, I know that, I know it.\\
336 - I got a wonderful surprise party all
fixed up for her.\\
337 - You have?\\
338 - Why, sure.\\
339 - I was just about to call the
apartment and ask her\\
340 - to bring me down some music that I
left on top of the piano.\\
341 - Now, what are you talking about her
walking the streets?\\
342 - Well, I guess I exaggerated, but...
oh, she was so upset.\\
343 - She went out for a walk.\\
344 - Oh, gee, I didn't want that to
happen.\\
345 - Well, look, Mrs. Trumbull, as soon as
she comes back,\\
346 - tell her that I called\\
347 - and that I want her to bring me some
music\\
348 - that I left on top of the piano right
down to the club.\\
349 - All right, Mr. Ricardo.\\
350 - And don't you worry, I'll stay with
the baby.\\
351 - Oh, thank you, Mrs. Trumbull.\\
352 - You're a real doll.\\
353 - (giggles)\\
354 - Muchas gracias.\\
355 - Adios, amigo.\\
356 - (hiccups)\\
357 - (hiccups)\\
358 - (marching band playing)\\
359 - (whistle blows)\\
360 - (hiccups)\\
361 - Friends, I think we have found here\\
362 - a poor, lonely soul who needs our
help.\\
363 - Oh, you mean me?\\
364 - Indeed we do, my dear.\\
365 - We who know what it is to be lonely,
cast off and forgotten,\\
366 - bring you friendship.\\
367 - Oh, well, thanks just the same, but
I'm all right.\\
368 - Well, open up your heart and let our
friendship in.\\
369 - We know what it is to have\\
370 - to spend the night on a park bench.\\
371 - Oh, you've got me all wrong.\\
372 - I'm all right, I got plenty of money.\\
373 - We're sure of that.\\
374 - No, really, (hiccups)
I'm loaded.\\
375 - We're sure of that, too.\\
376 - Oh! Oh, no, you don't understand.\\
377 - You see, I always get the hiccups
when I cry,\\
378 - and, well, I...
I've been crying.\\
379 - I don't know why I should tell you,
but...\\
380 - well, today was my birthday\\
381 - and nobody even...\\
382 - Oh, it's her birthday.\\
383 - (blows whistle)\\
384 - Happy birthday to you\\
385 - Happy birthday to you\\
386 - Happy birthday, dear...\\
387 - Lucy.\\
388 - Lucy\\
389 - Happy birthday to you.\\
390 - Oh, thank you very much.\\
391 - That's very nice. Thanks.\\
392 - You don't have any friends, do you?\\
393 - No, I don't.\\
394 - Well, you have friends now.\\
395 - Come with us, my dear.\\
396 - Oh, no, I couldn't.\\
397 - Oh, you still don't trust us, do you?\\
398 - Well, it isn't that I don't trust...\\
399 - Is there anyone here among us\\
400 - who would like to tell of his
experience\\
401 - with The Friends of the Friendless?\\
402 - I would like to do that, sir.\\
403 - I would like to tell you\\
404 - of something that happened to me\\
405 - and the lesson I learned\\
406 - and the meaning of true friendship.\\
407 - I didn't have a friend in the world.\\
408 - I was just a bit of flotsam\\
409 - in the sea of life,\\
410 - a pitiful outcast\\
411 - shunned by my fellow man.\\
412 - I was a mess.\\
413 - And then one day they came along--\\
414 - these good people--\\
415 - unasked,\\
416 - The Friends of the Friendless.\\
417 - And they put their arm around my
waist\\
418 - and they said, "We will be your
friend\\
419 - "because you are friendless\\
420 - "and we are The Friends of the
Friendless.\\
421 - "And if you accept our friendship,\\
422 - "you will never again be friendless,\\
423 - "for we are The Friends of the
Friendless\\
424 - and you will have friends."\\
425 - To this day, I have never been
friendless.\\
426 - I have friends...\\
427 - friends in the time of joy...\\
428 - friends in the time of sorrow...\\
429 - real friends...\\
430 - true friends...\\
431 - friends.\\
432 - Friends.\\
433 - Friends.\\
434 - My friends.\\
435 - You will come with us?\\
436 - No.\\
437 - No, I want you to go with me.\\
438 - There's someone I want to give a
lesson to\\
439 - in the true meaning of friendship.\\
440 - Of course.\\
441 - (blows whistle)\\
442 - (marching band playing)\\
443 - (enthusiastic applause)\\
444 - Thank you, thank you, thank you.\\
445 - Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.\\
446 - Thank you.
You're a wonderful audience.\\
447 - Those were Pugh and Carroll--\\
448 - the two greatest contortionists in
America today.\\
449 - And now, we'd like to introduce...\\
450 - (marching band playing)\\
451 - (whistle blows)\\
452 - We are friends of the friendless\\
453 - Yes, we are, yes, we are.\\
454 - We are friends of the friendless\\
455 - Be they near, be they far.\\
456 - We uplift the poor downtrodden\\
457 - And we sober up the sodden\\
458 - We are friends of the friendless\\
459 - Yes, we are, yes, we are.\\
460 - I want to tell you all something that
happened to me,\\
461 - the lesson I learned tonight\\
462 - and the true meaning of friendship.\\
463 - These people are my friends, The
Friends of the Friendless.\\
464 - And I was friendless.\\
465 - I was just a bit of flotsam in the
sea,\\
466 - a pitiful outcast shunned by my
fellow man.\\
467 - I was a mess.\\
468 - The people I thought were my friends
forsook me.\\
469 - Even my own husband\\
470 - proved he was just a husband\\
471 - and not a friend.\\
472 - Today was my birthday,\\
473 - and do you think anybody remembered?\\
474 - Nobody remembered.\\
475 - Nobody did a thing about it.\\
476 - Nobody even as much...
not a sing...\\
477 - CROWD: Happy birthday!\\
478 - Ethel!\\
479 - Happy birthday, sweetheart.\\
480 - Happy birthday?\\
481 - Happy birthday for me?\\
482 - Yeah, honey, we didn't forget your
birthday.\\
483 - We had this thing planned for weeks.\\
484 - We just couldn't get a hold of you--\\
485 - you had run out of the house.\\
486 - Nobody could find you.\\
487 - Oh, no!\\
488 - Oh, honey.\\
489 - And I got a wonderful present for
you.\\
490 - You want to hear it?\\
491 - Hear it?\\
492 - Yeah.\\
493 - (band begins playing)\\
494 - I love Lucy and she loves me\\
495 - We're as happy as two can be\\
496 - Sometimes we quarrel, but then\\
497 - How we love making up again.\\
498 - Lucy kisses like no one can\\
499 - She's my missus and I'm her man\\
500 - And life is heaven, you see\\

\subsection {Episode 26: The Ricardos Change Apartments}
1 - (I Love Lucy theme song playing)\\
2 - Oh.\\
3 - Hi, Lucy.\\
4 - Oh, hi.\\
5 - Look around, Ethel.\\
6 - You wouldn't know there was a baby in
this apartment,\\
7 - would you?\\
8 - Well, I might get a slight clue\\
9 - from that bundle you're carrying in
your arms.\\
10 - No, I mean you wouldn't know that a
baby lived here,\\
11 - you know, with all the things you
have to have for a baby.\\
12 - Just by looking at this room\\
13 - you wouldn't notice that.\\
14 - You know, a high chair and a crib\\
15 - and diapers and bottles and bottle
warmers and toys.\\
16 - So, what's your point?\\
17 - So, it just shows what you can do
with a little system.\\
18 - I had to find a place for everything\\
19 - if we're going to be stuck in this
apartment.\\
20 - What do you mean, "stuck"?\\
21 - Well, I've been trying to convince
Ricky\\
22 - that we need a larger apartment now
that we have the baby,\\
23 - but I can't get anywhere with him.\\
24 - Well, I'm glad.\\
25 - I don't want you moving away,\\
26 - and I haven't got a bigger apartment
that's vacant.\\
27 - Well, it wouldn't matter if you did.\\
28 - Ricky says we can't afford it.\\
29 - Yeah, honey.\\
30 - Well, you sure did a good job\\
31 - of putting everything away, honey.\\
32 - I came up to borrow a cup of sugar.\\
33 - Will you loan it to me?\\
34 - Yeah.\\
35 - What a matter?\\
36 - (baby crying)\\
37 - (rattling)\\
38 - Here's your sugar.\\
39 - Lucy...
Hmm?\\
40 - I might be slightly confused\\
41 - because I've only lived\\
42 - Yeah.\\
43 - Well, do you always keep the sugar in
the bedroom?\\
44 - Oh, it wasn't in the bedroom;\\
45 - it was in the bathroom.\\
46 - You see, I found a place for each
thing,\\
47 - but when I came to the sugar,\\
48 - the kitchen was all full.\\
49 - Uh-huh.\\
50 - Well, thanks for the sugar.\\
51 - I got to go bake my cake.\\
52 - Oh, that reminds me,\\
53 - I got to get a roast in the oven.\\
54 - So long.\\
55 - Bye.\\
56 - Lucy, I'm home.\\
57 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
58 - Oh, hi.\\
59 - Lucy.\\
60 - Yeah?\\
61 - There's no room in the closet for my
coat.\\
62 - Nonsense-- I reorganized the entire
apartment today\\
63 - and there is a place for everything.\\
64 - You're right.\\
65 - Wait a minute, wait a minute.\\
66 - What am I going to do with this?\\
67 - I guess you'll just have to wear it.\\
68 - Listen, have I got time before dinner
to do some work?\\
69 - I'll say.\\
70 - Lucy!\\
71 - Yeah?\\
72 - What are all my socks doing in the
desk?\\
73 - I'm keeping them there now.\\
74 - Your underwear is in the other
drawer.\\
75 - So what happened to the dresser?\\
76 - I had to have more room for the
baby's things.\\
77 - I'm putting things away for three
now, dear.\\
78 - All right, all right, all right, all
right, okay.\\
79 - (high-pitched squeak)\\
80 - (squeak)\\
81 - (squeak)\\
82 - (squeaks)\\
83 - Ay, quÃ© barbaridad!\\
84 - Mira, Â¿quÃ© tienen las cosas?, los
juguetes aquÃ­\\
85 - y las medias allÃ­ los calzoncillos
allÃ¡\\
86 - y no se puede sentar en la casa...\\
87 - Temper, temper...\\
88 - temper.\\
89 - Why don't you put these things away
where they belong?\\
90 - Gladly-- where do they belong?\\
91 - Well, there must be some better place\\
92 - to put all this junk\\
93 - than under the cushions in the living
room.\\
94 - Not in this stuffy little crackerbox.\\
95 - Ricky, I worked very hard\\
96 - finding a place for everything.\\
97 - You don't realize what a problem it
is.\\
98 - After all, I'm only human.\\
99 - I can only do so much, you know.\\
100 - All right, all right, all right, all
right!\\
101 - Let's not go through that again.\\
102 - Go through what again?\\
103 - (mockingly): "This apartment is
entirely too small\\
104 - "for the two of us and little Ricky,\\
105 - and if we don't move to a larger
apartment, I'll go crazy."\\
106 - Well, I'm glad you finally agreed
with me.\\
107 - Never mind that.\\
108 - Now, look, honey, I know it's crowded
here,\\
109 - and I would love to move just as much
as you would,\\
110 - but we can't afford it.\\
111 - Can't afford it!
Can't afford it!\\
112 - That's all you ever say anymore.\\
113 - Well, we can't afford it!\\
114 - There you go again!\\
115 - Well, we can't!\\
116 - Well, I can't afford to work so hard
either.\\
117 - You don't know how tough it is.\\
118 - I'm wasting away to nothing.\\
119 - Well, you're the fattest nothing I've
ever seen.\\
120 - Well!\\
121 - Now, look, we are staying right here\\
122 - and that's all there is to it.\\
123 - Hey, I forgot to tell you...\\
124 - Well, I'll see you later.\\
125 - Wait a minute, Ethel.\\
126 - Come back here.\\
127 - I'm just trying to reason\\
128 - with Mr. Ricky Ricardo, the Cuban
skinflint.\\
129 - Hey, I came up to tell you something.\\
130 - You know the Bensons that live in 3B?\\
131 - Yeah.\\
132 - Their daughter got married this
afternoon.\\
133 - Really?\\
134 - Yeah, I just saw Mr. and Mrs. Benson
in the hall.\\
135 - They both reacted in the strangest
way\\
136 - to their daughter's wedding--\\
137 - she was crying and he was laughing.\\
138 - He probably thought that he would
never unload her.\\
139 - Oh, I'll have Mrs. Benson\\
140 - crying on my shoulder for months.\\
141 - Every time she faces her daughter's
empty room,\\
142 - she'll rush right...\\
143 - Empty room.\\
144 - They've got an extra room they don't
need!\\
145 - Oh, gee, I hope they don't move.\\
146 - I hope they do.\\
147 - Why, Lucy!\\
148 - That way we could move to a larger
apartment\\
149 - and still stay in the building.\\
150 - Yeah, but we'd lose a tenant.\\
151 - Oh.\\
152 - Maybe they'll trade.\\
153 - ETHEL: Hey, that's a wonderful idea.\\
154 - LUCY: Do you think they'd do it?\\
155 - Now, wait a minute.\\
156 - ETHEL: There's no harm in asking
them.\\
157 - I bet we could talk them into it.\\
158 - LUCY: That would just be ideal.
Lucy.\\
159 - We could take their daughter's room,\\
160 - make it into the nursery.\\
161 - I know just how the furniture would
go.\\
162 - ETHEL: And then she wouldn't Ethel.\\
163 - have to face that empty room...\\
164 - (both talking at once)\\
165 - I "wun't swish aparments."\\
166 - Did you understand what I said?\\
167 - All right.\\
168 - What did I say?\\
169 - You "wun't swish aparments."\\
170 - "Buh" why?\\
171 - Look, the Bensons' apartment\\
172 - is larger than this apartment.\\
173 - Therefore, it must cost more\\
174 - than this apartment.\\
175 - $20 a month more.\\
176 - You see?\\
177 - Now, there you are.\\
178 - Now, I told you, I would love to move\\
179 - just as much as you would,\\
180 - but we can't afford it.\\
181 - I know, I know.\\
182 - Those must be\\
183 - the first English words you ever
learned.\\
184 - ETHEL: Ricky, I know\\
185 - this isn't any of my business,\\
186 - but Lucy is awful crowded here,\\
187 - and, well, you know there is that
extra room downstairs...\\
188 - Ethel, Ethel, never mind.\\
189 - Ricky is right.\\
190 - After all, Ricky is my husband,\\
191 - he's little Ricky's father,\\
192 - and I respect his judgment.\\
193 - In all the years that we've been
married,\\
194 - I've never known him to be anything\\
195 - but generous and kindhearted\\
196 - and wonderful.\\
197 - Kiss me.\\
198 - I can't afford it.\\
199 - What do you mean, you can't afford
it?\\
200 - That kiss will cost me $20 a month.\\
201 - You don't love me anymore, Ricky!\\
202 - You don't care how hard I work!\\
203 - You don't care\\
204 - if little Ricky is so crowded\\
205 - that he can't even move around!\\
206 - (mockingly): I do, too, Lucy!\\
207 - I love you very much\\
208 - and I care that little Ricky is so
crowded\\
209 - and I think it's terrible...\\
210 - Oh, shut up!\\
211 - Come on, Ethel!\\
212 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!\\
213 - (rattling)\\
214 - Ay!\\
215 - Hi.\\
216 - Hi.\\
217 - Hi.\\
218 - Any new developments since last
night?\\
219 - No.\\
220 - Is there anything you can think of\\
221 - that we can do to help you, Lucy?\\
222 - Anything?\\
223 - Anything at all?\\
224 - No.\\
225 - Thanks, Fred.\\
226 - We'll just have to go on living
exactly the way we are.\\
227 - Little Ricky is going to get awfully
cramped\\
228 - sleeping in that crib until he's 21
years old.\\
229 - Gee, I wish there was\\
230 - something we could do.\\
231 - Of course, it's just the extra rent
that stands in the way.\\
232 - If we could get the Benson apartment\\
233 - for the same amount of money that we
pay here,\\
234 - there wouldn't be any problem.\\
235 - (no voice)\\
236 - (no voice)\\
237 - Don't you think that possibly...?\\
238 - Maybe you could...?\\
239 - No.\\
240 - It wouldn't be fair to the other
tenants.\\
241 - Oh...\\
242 - I guess you're right, Fred.\\
243 - We'll just have to stay the way we
are\\
244 - until we get so crowded we can't turn
around.\\
245 - Can't turn around.\\
246 - ETHEL: What are you talking about?\\
247 - What a dope I've been!\\
248 - Of course Ricky is willing to stay
here\\
249 - if I break my back putting everything
away.\\
250 - I've been doing everything all wrong.\\
251 - Look at that gleam in her eye.\\
252 - (creaking)\\
253 - (giggles)\\
254 - (Ricky singing)\\
255 - Lucy?\\
256 - Yes, dear?\\
257 - Hey, what is all this stuff?\\
258 - What's this thing doing here?\\
259 - That's little Ricky's slide.\\
260 - Oh, no, come on, now, Lucy!\\
261 - What's going on?\\
262 - Nothing, dear.\\
263 - Just a few things we needed for the
baby\\
264 - and I didn't have any other place to
put them.\\
265 - Lucy...!\\
266 - Oh, I know it's crowded, dear,\\
267 - but you'll just have to bear with it
if we're going to stay in this teensy
apartment.\\
268 - Lucy, I sw...
How am I supposed to get in here?\\
269 - Be my guest.\\
270 - (train whistle blowing)\\
271 - Look out for the Super Chief!\\
272 - Look out for the Super Chief!\\
273 - Na-na-na!\\
274 - Na-na-na-na!\\
275 - Na-na-na, na-na-na!\\
276 - Here we go, whoo-whoo!\\
277 - Whoo-whoo!\\
278 - Whoo-whoo.\\
279 - (laughing)\\
280 - Lucy, I know what you're up to\\
281 - and we are not going to move!\\
282 - Well, if you want to live like this.\\
283 - You are going to take all this stuff
back.\\
284 - No, I'm not.\\
285 - Oh, yes, you are.\\
286 - No, I'm not.\\
287 - Oh, yes, you are, and not only that,\\
288 - but I'm going to put you on top of my
knee and spank you.\\
289 - Well, you have to catch me first.\\
290 - (laughing)\\
291 - Oh-oh-oh!\\
292 - Ricky!\\
293 - Ricky, you're making me dizzy!\\
294 - Ricky!\\
295 - Oh, Ricky, you're making me dizzy!\\
296 - Ricky!\\
297 - (wailing)\\
298 - Oh!\\
299 - Oh, Ricky!\\
300 - Ow, Ricky!\\
301 - I'll take them back, I'll take them
back!\\
302 - Ricky!\\
303 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
304 - Good morning, Mrs. Benson.\\
305 - Hello, Mrs. Ricardo, Mrs. Mertz.\\
306 - Come in, come in.\\
307 - We just thought we'd come down and
chat a while.\\
308 - Oh, how nice.\\
309 - Now, sit down and make yourselves at
home.\\
310 - I was just mixing a meat loaf.\\
311 - Oh, it smells good.\\
312 - Oh, thank you.\\
313 - I'll be right with you.\\
314 - Oh, take your time.\\
315 - Take your time.\\
316 - Gee, won't this be a wonderful place
for us to live in?\\
317 - It'll be a wonderful place\\
318 - for you to recuperate in\\
319 - when Ricky finds out what you're up
to.\\
320 - Oh, he won't mind.\\
321 - I just used\\
322 - the wrong approach last night, that's
all.\\
323 - But I'm going to take all those toys
back.\\
324 - Even if you do talk Mrs. Benson\\
325 - into switching apartments with you,\\
326 - this apartment is still going to cost
Ricky\\
327 - an extra $20 a month.\\
328 - It isn't going to cost Ricky
anything.\\
329 - It's going to cost me $20 a month.\\
330 - I'm going to scrimp and save\\
331 - and pay it out of my allowance.\\
332 - You're already drawn on your
allowance\\
333 - seven months in advance!\\
334 - Oh, you'll never be able to pay me.\\
335 - I will, too.\\
336 - If I were smart,\\
337 - I'd let you have this place for the
same price;\\
338 - then we could still stay friends.\\
339 - Yeah!\\
340 - But I'm not that smart.\\
341 - Well, then you just have to help me
work on Mrs. Benson.\\
342 - Okay.\\
343 - Now, after all, it's for her own
good.\\
344 - She won't have to worry about her
daughter being gone...\\
345 - Sorry to keep you waiting.\\
346 - Oh.\\
347 - Well, now, there we are.\\
348 - Uh, how have you been, Mrs. Benson?\\
349 - Oh, fine, just fine.\\
350 - It's a beautiful morning, isn't it?\\
351 - Wonderful.\\
352 - Don't you just love the spring?\\
353 - Uh-huh.\\
354 - Mmm!\\
355 - Congratulations on your daughter's
marriage.\\
356 - Uh...\\
357 - (crying loudly)\\
358 - My baby, my baby!\\
359 - LUCY: Oh...\\
360 - Oh, the thorns of motherhood.\\
361 - Oh, poor Mrs. Benson.\\
362 - Yes, poor Mrs. Benson.\\
363 - She's left me, my little baby.\\
364 - (sobbing)\\
365 - Oh, well, don't feel too badly, Mrs.
Benson,\\
366 - she'll come to see you often.\\
367 - Oh, no, she won't.\\
368 - And I'm all alone.\\
369 - Oh, well, you still have Mr. Benson.\\
370 - Eh!\\
371 - Oh, I... I feel so sorry for Mrs.
Benson,\\
372 - rattling around in this big apartment\\
373 - and her daughter's room standing
there empty,\\
374 - reminding her that she's all alone.\\
375 - (sobbing)\\
376 - Oh, I know.\\
377 - What?\\
378 - Um, this is a big sacrifice to make,\\
379 - but I can't stand to see her suffer.\\
380 - Our apartment would be just perfect
for the Bensons.\\
381 - Why, yes, it's just the right size.\\
382 - No, no, no, I couldn't,\\
383 - I couldn't...\\
384 - It's $20 a month cheaper.\\
385 - Oh?\\
386 - Well, Mr. Benson would like that.\\
387 - Oh, yeah, when do we switch? Today?\\
388 - Oh, no, no, my dear.\\
389 - I couldn't do it today.\\
390 - You see, I'll be out all day\\
391 - helping my baby get settled.\\
392 - She'll get no help\\
393 - from that nincompoop she's married.\\
394 - Well, why don't you give me the key\\
395 - and I'll have everything all fixed up
when you come back?\\
396 - Oh, my dear, now, I don't know.\\
397 - What about the moving?\\
398 - Isn't that very expensive?\\
399 - Oh, well, don't you worry about it.\\
400 - I'll take care of everything.\\
401 - As a matter of fact,\\
402 - some of my best friends are furniture
movers.\\
403 - Really?\\
404 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
405 - I certainly appreciate all you're
doing.\\
406 - Oh, that's all right.\\
407 - Bless you.\\
408 - Well, I'll go and get you the key.\\
409 - All right.\\
410 - (chuckling): Oh, dear.\\
411 - If you think I'm going to help you
carry\\
412 - all of this furniture...\\
413 - Shh... be quiet.\\
414 - We'll talk about it later.\\
415 - You want us to stay here, don't you?\\
416 - Yes, but I'm not going to help you
carry\\
417 - all this furniture back and forth...\\
418 - Fred will.\\
419 - Fred wouldn't touch a piece of it.\\
420 - What do you mean?\\
421 - Well, we're ready.\\
422 - Oh, shh!\\
423 - I told you not to come up here\\
424 - until he had left.\\
425 - Now, go on.\\
426 - I'll pound on the floor when I want
you.\\
427 - Go on.
All right.\\
428 - Hurry up, before he sees you.\\
429 - You better hurry, dear, you'll be
late for rehearsal.\\
430 - RICKY: No, I got plenty of time.\\
431 - What are you going to do today?\\
432 - Why do you ask that?\\
433 - I just thought you could take my tux
to the cleaners.\\
434 - Oh... oh, sure, sure, sure.\\
435 - I haven't got a thing to do.\\
436 - I'm just going to be sitting around,
resting, relaxing.\\
437 - Well, good-bye, dear.\\
438 - Good-bye.\\
439 - Bye.\\
440 - Uh...\\
441 - My foot went to sleep.\\
442 - I forgot my music.\\
443 - Oh. Don't be late for your rehearsal,
dear.\\
444 - Oh, listen, honey, there's something\\
445 - I want to talk to you about.\\
446 - What, dear?\\
447 - Well, you know, I've been thinking\\
448 - the whole situation about moving and
everything,\\
449 - you know, and really I want you to
understand\\
450 - that I would like to very much,\\
451 - but you don't seem to realize...\\
452 - I do realize, dear...\\
453 - No, you don't.\\
454 - Yes, I do.\\
455 - I understand exactly.\\
456 - You don't...\\
457 - Yes, I do, dear, good-bye.\\
458 - Let's get started.\\
459 - (sighs deeply)\\
460 - Hey, where's the baby?\\
461 - Mrs. Trumbull is going to take care
of him today.\\
462 - Now, okay, everybody grab something
up here,\\
463 - take it downstairs, pick up something
downstairs,\\
464 - bring it up here and keep on going\\
465 - till we get everything switched
around in both apartments.\\
466 - Now, come on.\\
467 - All right.\\
468 - (grunts)\\
469 - Well, my back has been bothering me
lately.\\
470 - You've been using that same gag for
years.\\
471 - Come on, now, and do a man's work.\\
472 - Lucy, give him that coffee table.\\
473 - That's too heavy for you.\\
474 - There, that's better.\\
475 - Yeah!\\
476 - Come on.\\
477 - (sighs contentedly)\\
478 - (banging)\\
479 - ETHEL: Watch out, now.\\
480 - Take it easy.\\
481 - All right.\\
482 - Take it easy going around that
corner.\\
483 - Don't scratch anything, now, Fred.\\
484 - Watch your fingers.\\
485 - Gee, this is heavy, isn't it?\\
486 - Where do you want this?\\
487 - Oh, right there, thank you.\\
488 - Hey, we're pretty fast movers, aren't
we?\\
489 - Yeah, we're the busy little bees, all
right.\\
490 - Well, let's not lose any time, busy
bees.\\
491 - Buzz on up and get some more
furniture.\\
492 - All right, all right.\\
493 - Say, Lucy.\\
494 - Correct me if I'm wrong,\\
495 - but we've been moving for three hours
now\\
496 - and there's one member of our little
moving firm\\
497 - that I haven't passed on the stairs
lately.\\
498 - Has Fred goofed off?\\
499 - I wasn't referring to Fred.\\
500 - Well, Ethel, you certainly don't mean
me.\\
501 - Don't I?\\
502 - Why, I've been working like a Trojan\\
503 - overseeing things.\\
504 - Someone's got to be in charge.\\
505 - Well, let's take turns being in
charge.\\
506 - Well!\\
507 - Apparently one of our busy bees is a
sorehead.\\
508 - Well, apparently one of our busy bees\\
509 - thinks she's the queen.\\
510 - All right, all right.\\
511 - Don't get your stinger out of joint.\\
512 - You just relax.\\
513 - I'll move all the rest of my
furniture myself.\\
514 - Everything!\\
515 - Well, this is the last of it.\\
516 - Nice timing.\\
517 - Oh, come on, now, let's not get mad.\\
518 - We're all finished.\\
519 - Let's all go down to the corner
drugstore\\
520 - and relax over an ice cream soda.\\
521 - I'll buy.\\
522 - Well, you talked me into it.\\
523 - Come on.\\
524 - You know, I may have a sandwich\\
525 - and a piece of apple pie.\\
526 - With whipped cream-- I'm hungry, huh?\\
527 - Ricky will just love this apartment\\
528 - once he gets...\\
529 - What happened?\\
530 - What happened?\\
531 - How did the Benson furniture get back
in here?\\
532 - I can't understand it!\\
533 - I didn't have anything stronger than
an ice cream soda.\\
534 - Hi.\\
535 - I can't... Hi.\\
536 - How do you like it?\\
537 - How do I like what?\\
538 - Oh.\\
539 - Oh, they didn't get here, huh?\\
540 - Who didn't get here?\\
541 - Honey, I had a wonderful surprise for
you,\\
542 - but I guess they didn't get here,\\
543 - so I might as well tell you.\\
544 - Tell me what?\\
545 - I got Mr.
Benson's okay,\\
546 - and then I called Mrs. Trumbull\\
547 - and asked her to call me\\
548 - as soon as you left the apartment,\\
549 - and then I called the movers\\
550 - and told them to rush over here\\
551 - and switch all the furniture\\
552 - from our apartment to this apartment\\
553 - and all the furniture from this
apartment to...\\
554 - Ew...
Ew...
Ew...\\

1 - (I Love Lucy theme music plays)\\
2 - It's your bid, Ethel.\\
3 - Uh, one club.\\
4 - Say, did you see that dress\\
5 - Sylvia Collins had on\\
6 - at the dance Saturday night?\\
7 - Yeah, what there was of it.\\
8 - Uh... one heart.\\
9 - One no trump.\\
10 - How do you suppose she held it up?\\
11 - Two diamonds.\\
12 - Who knows?\\
13 - All I know is every man in the room\\
14 - was waiting for her to exhale.\\
15 - I'll say.\\
16 - Fred's eyes bugged out\\
17 - like a bullfrog\\
18 - with an overactive thyroid.\\
19 - Uh, I pass.\\
20 - Hey, how about the attention\\
21 - that Sylvia Collins got from our
husbands?\\
22 - How about that?\\
23 - Uh, I pass.\\
24 - Pass.\\
25 - I get it for two diamonds.\\
26 - Put your cards down, girl.\\
27 - You know, she didn't light her own
cigarette once.\\
28 - Every time I looked up,\\
29 - some man was racing across the room\\
30 - with a lighted match.\\
31 - Looked like the start of the Olympic
games.\\
32 - Yeah, the indoor cigarette lighting
sprint.\\
33 - I didn't know\\
34 - my little fat torchbearer\\
35 - could run that fast.\\
36 - Well, of all the countries
represented,\\
37 - Cuba seemed to be taking the most
first prizes.\\
38 - And just what do you mean by that?\\
39 - Well, it wasn't my husband who taught
her how to play "Babalu"\\
40 - on an upturned wastebasket.\\
41 - Now, just a minute.\\
42 - Well...\\
43 - Oh, it's getting to be\\
44 - the same old story\\
45 - every time we play cards:\\
46 - Sylvia Collins, Sylvia Collins,
Sylvia Collins.\\
47 - Well, why not?\\
48 - She's the biggest female wolf\\
49 - in our crowd.
Yeah.\\
50 - The way she attracts men.\\
51 - She's not so beautiful.\\
52 - No. What's she got that we haven't
got?\\
53 - No husband.\\
54 - Hey, I know how to cure this
situation.\\
55 - ETHEL: How?\\
56 - Don't you see?\\
57 - The men are intrigued by Sylvia\\
58 - because she's single.\\
59 - This makes her mysterious and
exciting.\\
60 - We have to find Sylvia a husband.\\
61 - Good idea.
A husband?
A husband?\\
62 - Yeah, it's our only chance.\\
63 - Now, where can we find her a husband?\\
64 - I'll make the sacrifice.\\
65 - She can have mine.\\
66 - Now, Ethel.\\
67 - Is it agreed, then?\\
68 - The four of us will dedicate
ourselves\\
69 - to getting Sylvia Collins a husband.\\
70 - Agreed?\\
71 - ALL: Agreed.\\
72 - Okay.\\
73 - Oh, look, there's going to be a
wedding.\\
74 - There we go.\\
75 - Yeah.\\
76 - It's all gone.\\
77 - You don't have to take any more,
honey, no.\\
78 - You want to give Mama a big burp,
huh?\\
79 - Give me a big burp.\\
80 - Come on, great big one.\\
81 - Oh, come on, give Mama a big burp.\\
82 - Oh, oh... that's a good one, honey.\\
83 - Oh, my.\\
84 - You're getting to be such a big boy.\\
85 - Yes, sir.\\
86 - Oh, come on, now.\\
87 - Just going to go sleepy-bye.\\
88 - You're going to go sleepy-bye, that's
all.\\
89 - Isn't it wonderful?\\
90 - Honey, you got your own little bed in
your own little room.\\
91 - Oh, come on now.\\
92 - Hi, honey.\\
93 - Hi, honey.\\
94 - Here's your Papa.\\
95 - Time to kiss him good night.\\
96 - Ah, what's the matter?\\
97 - What's the matter?\\
98 - Aw, come on.\\
99 - Were you a good boy today?\\
100 - Say "Yes, Daddy."\\
101 - Ahh...\\
102 - Come on.\\
103 - Were you a good girl?\\
104 - Yes, Daddy.\\
105 - Yes.\\
106 - Yes, daddy.\\
107 - You're going to go bye?\\
108 - You're going to go to bed?\\
109 - Say, "Yes, Daddy."\\
110 - Good night.\\
111 - I'll be out in a minute, honey.\\
112 - Oh, he's such a tired boy.\\
113 - He doesn't want to go to sleep,\\
114 - that's all.\\
115 - Well...\\
116 - Come on, honey.\\
117 - Good night, boy.\\
118 - Go say, "Goodnighty night, Papa."\\
119 - There we go, honey.\\
120 - Now, come on, it's time you were in
bed.\\
121 - Little sleepy boy.\\
122 - Come on, now, you go sleepy-bye.\\
123 - (clucking)\\
124 - Honey, we're going to have a little
company.\\
125 - Company?
Yeah.\\
126 - Why didn't you tell me?\\
127 - Oh, I forgot about it.\\
128 - It's a friend of Fred's,\\
129 - and he and Ethel are going to be late
getting home\\
130 - so they asked me if we would
entertain him\\
131 - till they get here.\\
132 - Who is it?\\
133 - I don't know.\\
134 - Some traveling salesman or something.\\
135 - He's a nephew of one of Fred's old
buddies,\\
136 - and since he's a bachelor,\\
137 - they thought that he would like a
home-cooked meal.\\
138 - Oh, that's all very nice, but I...\\
139 - A bachelor?\\
140 - And young, too.\\
141 - Oh, boy!\\
142 - Real live bachelor, right here in my
own trap.\\
143 - What are you so excited about?\\
144 - You're married, remember?\\
145 - Oh, don't be silly.\\
146 - He sounds like the perfect man for
Sylvia Collins.\\
147 - You see, the girls in the club have
decided\\
148 - that we should find Sylvia a husband.\\
149 - Now, Lucy, lay off this guy, will
you?\\
150 - Why is it that every married woman\\
151 - thinks it's their sacred duty\\
152 - to marry off every single guy?\\
153 - Oh, we do not.\\
154 - Well, see that you don't.\\
155 - After all, if this guy is fortunate
enough\\
156 - to still be single, I don't...\\
157 - What?\\
158 - I, uh... I didn't mean it that way.\\
159 - I mean, if he's smart enough\\
160 - to still be...\\
161 - How's that?\\
162 - There must be some word that
describes\\
163 - what I'm trying to say.\\
164 - The word is "stupid."\\
165 - All right, stupid.\\
166 - If the guy's stupid enough to still
be single,\\
167 - leave him alone.\\
168 - That's better.\\
169 - After all,\\
170 - ignorance is bliss.\\
171 - You let Sylvia Collins get her own
husband.\\
172 - I wouldn't mind if she got her own,\\
173 - but she's getting everybody else's.\\
174 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
175 - There he is.\\
176 - I got to put my face on.\\
177 - Now, Lucy, don't forget what I told
you.\\
178 - I don't want to hear one word\\
179 - that sounds like matchmaking.\\
180 - Oh, now, Ricky...\\
181 - I mean it.\\
182 - Oh, all right.\\
183 - All right.\\
184 - (chuckles)\\
185 - Mr. Ricardo?
Yeah.\\
186 - I'm Eddie Grant, Fred Mertz's friend.\\
187 - Oh, yeah, how are you, Eddie?\\
188 - Come on in, won't you?\\
189 - Sit down.
Thank you.\\
190 - Fred will be here in a little while.\\
191 - Fine.\\
192 - Would you like a cigarette?\\
193 - Yeah, swell, thank you.
You're welcome.\\
194 - Nice apartment.\\
195 - Thank you, Eddie.\\
196 - Listen, uh, Fred says\\
197 - that you just got in town.\\
198 - Yeah, I'm on a sales trip.\\
199 - Oh! What do you sell?\\
200 - Negligees.\\
201 - Negligees.\\
202 - Oh...\\
203 - Oh, dear, I didn't know you had
company.\\
204 - RICKY: Eddie, this is my wife, Lucy.\\
205 - Lucy, this is Eddie Grant.\\
206 - How do you do?\\
207 - How do you do, Mrs. Ricardo?\\
208 - Are you a native New Yorker?\\
209 - No, no, as a matter of fact,\\
210 - I'm on a sales trip.\\
211 - It's the first time in several years.\\
212 - Oh, my.\\
213 - I'll bet your wife\\
214 - is having a gay time in all the
shops.\\
215 - No, no, I'm not married.\\
216 - Not married?\\
217 - A big, handsome, intelligent man like
you\\
218 - not married?\\
219 - Well, Eddie, how do you like it here\\
220 - in New York City?\\
221 - I know just what you need, Mr.
Grant...\\
222 - Eddie.\\
223 - What?\\
224 - How would you like to have a
beautiful girl\\
225 - to take you around and show you the
town?
Go dancing...\\
226 - Lucy, leave Eddie alone.\\
227 - Eddie, Fred tells me\\
228 - that your uncle was in show business
with him.\\
229 - Oh, speaking of show business,\\
230 - you'll want to see all the big
Broadway shows.\\
231 - and it'd be just ridiculous if you
went alone.\\
232 - Wouldn't you like someone\\
233 - to share all that fun with you?\\
234 - Lucy, that'll be enough.\\
235 - Eddie, what kind of an act\\
236 - did your uncle have?\\
237 - He did a magic act.\\
238 - Sawed a woman in half.\\
239 - Oh, no kidding?\\
240 - Have you ever stopped to think\\
241 - how nice it would be\\
242 - to have a woman of your own to saw in
half?\\
243 - No, but I have.\\
244 - Well, hi, Eddie boy.\\
245 - Oh, Fred, how are you?\\
246 - Glad to see you.\\
247 - It's good to see you.\\
248 - Sorry we weren't in.\\
249 - That's all right.\\
250 - The Ricardos took good care of me.\\
251 - Oh, it was a pleasure.\\
252 - Well, let's get going-- Ethel's
waiting.\\
253 - Bye, Mr. Ricardo.\\
254 - Nice meeting you.\\
255 - Nice to have met you, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
256 - Nice to have met you.\\
257 - Oh, I think I'll go with you.\\
258 - I want to say hello to Ethel.\\
259 - All right.\\
260 - Lucy, I want you to stay here with
me.\\
261 - Oh, I'll be right back, dear.\\
262 - I know, honey.\\
263 - But I'll be lonesome.\\
264 - Well, I'll only be a minute.\\
265 - Don't go, dear.\\
266 - Well, on second thought, maybe I
better stay here.\\
267 - Yes.\\
268 - Well, good-bye, Eddie.\\
269 - Have a good time.\\
270 - You're going to have a wonderful
meal.\\
271 - Ethel really cooks well.\\
272 - What's the matter with you?\\
273 - You crazy or something?\\
274 - I just finished telling you\\
275 - that I don't want you to play cupid\\
276 - and you make us look ridiculous with
this guy\\
277 - trying to marry him to somebody\\
278 - he doesn't even know.\\
279 - How many times am I going to ask you\\
280 - not to meddle in other people's
affairs?\\
281 - If I asked you once,\\
282 - I asked you a thousand times.\\
283 - Lucy?\\
284 - Yeah? Ooh, I wanted to tell you,\\
285 - I tried to come over last night\\
286 - but Ricky just wouldn't let me.\\
287 - That Eddie Grant is perfect for
Sylvia Collins.\\
288 - I'll say-- I went to work on him\\
289 - the minute he walked in.\\
290 - Did you do any good?\\
291 - No.\\
292 - Fred kept kicking me under the table.\\
293 - We're just going to have to set up a
date ourselves.\\
294 - I'm going to call Sylvia.\\
295 - Okay.\\
296 - Let's see.\\
297 - That's, uh, C-2-2...\\
298 - You know, when I think how I'm
sticking my neck out\\
299 - for that bleach blonde in wolf's
clothing...\\
300 - Sylvia, darling, how are you?\\
301 - Yeah, this is Lucy.\\
302 - Oh, fine, thanks.\\
303 - Look, Sylvia, dear, I just met\\
304 - the most divine, handsome, well-to-do
bachelor\\
305 - and he's all alone,\\
306 - doesn't have anyone to show him
around town.\\
307 - Look, sweetie, sweetie, I told him
about you\\
308 - and he wants to have lunch with you
today.\\
309 - What's she saying?
Does she like the idea?\\
310 - She's drooling.\\
311 - Well, look, dear, can you meet him\\
312 - in the lobby of the Sherry Plaza at
noon?\\
313 - Yeah, well, just ask for him at the
desk.\\
314 - His name is Eddie Grant.\\
315 - That's right.\\
316 - Oh, he's just dreamy.\\
317 - You'll swoon.\\
318 - Okay, bye-bye.\\
319 - Well, that takes care of the spider--
now for the fly.\\
320 - (phone ringing)\\
321 - (whistling)\\
322 - Hello.\\
323 - Hello, Eddie.\\
324 - This is Lucy.\\
325 - Lucy Ricardo.\\
326 - Oh, hi, how are you?\\
327 - Oh, just fine, thanks.\\
328 - I'll bet you didn't expect\\
329 - to hear from me, did you?\\
330 - Well, not so soon.\\
331 - Look, Eddie,\\
332 - since you don't know any girls in
town,\\
333 - how would you like a date for lunch
today?\\
334 - Oh, I'd like it fine.\\
335 - But won't your husband mind?\\
336 - Oh, no, you don't understand.\\
337 - I was talking about someone else.\\
338 - Mm-hmm.\\
339 - No, really.\\
340 - A beautiful girl named Sylvia
Collins.\\
341 - You don't have to pretend with me,
Lucy.\\
342 - Now, look, Eddie, be serious.\\
343 - If you want to have lunch with
Sylvia,\\
344 - I'll arrange to have her meet you in
the lobby\\
345 - of your hotel at noontime.\\
346 - Okay, I'd love it.
I'll be there.\\
347 - All right, good.
She'll ask for you at the desk.\\
348 - Good-bye, Eddie.\\
349 - Good-bye... Sylvia.\\
350 - Well, that takes care of that.\\
351 - Come out here and help me with the
dishes.\\
352 - I think this is a wonderful idea.\\
353 - Get me circle 7-2-0-9-9, please.\\
354 - (phone rings)\\
355 - Hello.\\
356 - Fred? This is Eddie Grant.\\
357 - FRED: Oh, hi.\\
358 - Listen, I'm afraid I won't be able\\
359 - to have lunch with you today after
all.\\
360 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
361 - What's the matter?
Business?\\
362 - No, not really.\\
363 - I've got a date.\\
364 - That's all right, bring her along.\\
365 - EDDIE: No, I don't think I should.\\
366 - Oh, why not? I want to see what kind
of taste you have.\\
367 - There will only be the four of us.\\
368 - The four?\\
369 - Yeah, I've invited Ricky to come.\\
370 - No, no, Fred, I, uh...\\
371 - I couldn't bring her along, no.\\
372 - FRED: What's the matter?\\
373 - You ashamed of her?\\
374 - No!\\
375 - No, no, she's a doll, real dream...\\
376 - but to tell you the truth, Fred,\\
377 - she's, uh...
she's married, you know?\\
378 - You're the sly one.\\
379 - Well, I got to hang up now, Fred.\\
380 - I got a couple of business
appointments.\\
381 - I've got to meet her in the lobby at
noon.\\
382 - See you later.\\
383 - Good-bye, Eddie.\\
384 - (phone rings)\\
385 - Tropicana.\\
386 - Is Ricky Ricardo there?\\
387 - Yeah, just a moment, please.\\
388 - Oh, Ricky?\\
389 - Yeah.\\
390 - Telephone.\\
391 - Okay.\\
392 - Thanks.\\
393 - Hello.\\
394 - Hi, Rick?\\
395 - Yeah, hi, Fred.\\
396 - Eddie can't make it for lunch.\\
397 - Oh, that's too bad.
You want to skip it?\\
398 - Oh, no, no, now...\\
399 - here's what I thought.\\
400 - Uh, he's got a heavy date with some
beautiful doll.\\
401 - Special deal, you know what I mean?\\
402 - And I thought we might have a little
fun.\\
403 - RICKY: What do you mean?\\
404 - Well, we'll wait in the lobby\\
405 - until he meets her\\
406 - and then we'll have a little fun with
him.\\
407 - (chuckling)\\
408 - You old dog.\\
409 - FRED: It's the Sherry Plaza and I'll
meet you there at noon.\\
410 - Okay, they have good food there, so
we'll eat there.\\
411 - FRED: All right, good-bye, Rick.\\
412 - Good-bye, Fred.\\
413 - Uh-huh.\\
414 - Mm-hmm.\\
415 - Well, Marion, listen, I expected it.\\
416 - There just was no other way for that
marriage to go.\\
417 - That's right.\\
418 - That's right.\\
419 - What do they expect?\\
420 - Yeah, well, that's just life, I
guess.\\
421 - Well, look, dear, I'll call you again\\
422 - and we'll have a nice, long chat.\\
423 - Give my love to Norman, huh?\\
424 - Okay, dear, bye-bye.\\
425 - What's the matter?\\
426 - Do you have any idea\\
427 - how long you've been on that phone?\\
428 - I certainly do.\\
429 - I picked up the phone at 9:15.\\
430 - It is now 11:30.\\
431 - 11:30?\\
432 - I have a hairdresser's appointment at
12:30!\\
433 - Sylvia Collins has been trying to get
you for two hours.\\
434 - She finally had to call me.\\
435 - What does she want?\\
436 - She can't make that date with Eddie.\\
437 - She broke a cap off of a front tooth.\\
438 - Oh, no-- well, can't she go anyway?\\
439 - With her looks, one tooth\\
440 - isn't going to make any difference.\\
441 - She won't go.\\
442 - She says she looks like a beaver.\\
443 - Oh.\\
444 - She's been trying to get hold of
Eddie\\
445 - but he's not at the hotel.\\
446 - She could leave a message.\\
447 - He might not get it, though.\\
448 - Listen, will you stay here\\
449 - until Mrs. Trumbull gets here to take
care of Ricky?\\
450 - Yeah, why?\\
451 - Well, I'll stop by\\
452 - on my way to the beauty parlor\\
453 - and I'll tell Eddie myself.\\
454 - That's the safest way.\\
455 - Gee, isn't that too bad?\\
456 - That was such a perfect setup.\\
457 - (whistling softly)\\
458 - Oh, hello, Eddie.\\
459 - Well, well, well...\\
460 - If it isn't Sylvia Collins.\\
461 - Oh, now, Eddie.\\
462 - I came down here to tell you\\
463 - that Sylvia couldn't make it.\\
464 - Oh?\\
465 - No, now really.\\
466 - Listen, if you're thinking\\
467 - what I think you're thinking\\
468 - you're way off base.\\
469 - I'm thinking only one thing.\\
470 - Hi, Fred.\\
471 - Hi, Rick, let's go.\\
472 - Where you going?\\
473 - I thought you wanted to kid Eddie
Grant\\
474 - about his girlfriend.\\
475 - We haven't got time for that now, I'm
hungry.\\
476 - Well, come on, this is the best place
to eat.\\
477 - What's the matter with you?\\
478 - Are you crazy or something?\\
479 - Come on, let's go and eat.\\
480 - Oh, look there's Eddie now.\\
481 - Fred.\\
482 - Fred, stop it.\\
483 - You lost your mind?\\
484 - Wait a minute.\\
485 - Oh, no.\\
486 - Oh, hello, Ricky.\\
487 - Uh...\\
488 - Lucy.\\
489 - Well.\\
490 - Uh, Ricky, the...\\
491 - Ricky.\\
492 - Ricky, I can explain\\
493 - if you just give me a chance.\\
494 - Hi, Lucy.\\
495 - Hi.\\
496 - Is Ricky talking to you yet?\\
497 - No.\\
498 - I don't see why he should get so
upset\\
499 - just because I did a little
matchmaking.\\
500 - I know why.\\
501 - Fred just told me.\\
502 - Why?\\
503 - Well, Eddie thought\\
504 - you were making that date with him
for yourself,\\
505 - and being a man,\\
506 - he couldn't help bragging to Ricky
and Fred\\
507 - that he had a heavy date.\\
508 - And Ricky and Fred-- also being men--\\
509 - decided to go down there and spy on
him.\\
510 - So Ricky must have thought...\\
511 - Oh, no, Ricky was just mad at me\\
512 - because I was matchmaking.\\
513 - Are you sure?\\
514 - Well, one thing I'm sure of:\\
515 - we got to get Ricky and Eddie\\
516 - and everybody concerned together\\
517 - so we can explain this thing.\\
518 - Will you go down\\
519 - to Eddie's hotel with me?\\
520 - Yes, I think you need a chaperone.\\
521 - I'll get Mrs. Trumbull\\
522 - to take care of little Ricky.\\
523 - You get dressed right away.\\
524 - Okay, I'll get ready.\\
525 - Hurry up now.\\
526 - 925, this is it, isn't it?\\
527 - Oh, Eddie, I wanted to...\\
528 - Eddie?\\
529 - Eddie, I wanted to talk to you.\\
530 - Eddie, let us in, Eddie.\\
531 - Eddie, open the door.\\
532 - Come on, now.\\
533 - Let us in.\\
534 - Eddie?\\
535 - Let us in, Eddie.\\
536 - Oh, girls?\\
537 - I'm down in 914.\\
538 - If Eddie won't let you in, I will.\\
539 - Oh, go away...\\
540 - Fresh.\\
541 - How do you like that?\\
542 - Fresh.\\
543 - Eddie?\\
544 - Hello, Eddie.\\
545 - Well, I guess we might as well leave.\\
546 - He isn't going to open the door.\\
547 - Okay.\\
548 - (stomping)\\
549 - (with husky voice:)
Telegram for Mr. Grant.\\
550 - Eddie, we've got to talk to you.\\
551 - Eddie, we just got to talk to you,\\
552 - you understand?\\
553 - Now, Eddie, I've just got to talk to
you.\\
554 - Listen, I'm in a spot\\
555 - because you jumped to some stupid
conclusions.\\
556 - Ethel, get Sylvia on the phone, will
you?\\
557 - Sylvia Collins?\\
558 - Yes, Sylvia Collins, that very nice
girl\\
559 - I tried to get you a date with.\\
560 - The rest is just a silly coincidence\\
561 - and I want you to please explain it
to Ricky.\\
562 - You want me to explain it to Ricky?\\
563 - ETHEL: Sylvia, Lucy wants to talk to
you.\\
564 - Just a minute.\\
565 - Hello, Sylvia dear.\\
566 - Is your tooth better?\\
567 - That's good...\\
568 - Yes, as a matter of fact\\
569 - I want to introduce you to him right
now.\\
570 - Sylvia Collins, this is Eddie Grant.\\
571 - Oh, all right.\\
572 - Hello.\\
573 - No.\\
574 - No, she was exaggerating.\\
575 - Well, I guess it is a little curly.\\
576 - Oh, just average height.\\
577 - It's too bad we couldn't get together
yesterday, Syl.\\
578 - Well, how about today?\\
579 - Wonderful.\\
580 - I'll be down and get you in about a
half hour.\\
581 - What's that address again?\\
582 - Swell.\\
583 - So I'll be right down.\\
584 - Bye, Sylvia.\\
585 - Gee, I certainly owe you an apology.\\
586 - She sounds wonderful.\\
587 - You see?\\
588 - You'll bring her here\\
589 - and then we'll go down to the club\\
590 - and explain to Ricky.\\
591 - Okay, I will.\\
592 - Incidentally, girls, while I'm gone,\\
593 - I want you to pick out any two
negligees you want\\
594 - and I'll let you have them...\\
595 - (both squealing)\\
596 - wholesale.\\
597 - RICKY: Well, I'm glad you brought me\\
598 - down here today.\\
599 - How do you like that Eddie Grant\\
600 - thinking he had a date with Lucy?\\
601 - Yeah, how about that?\\
602 - He said 925, didn't he?\\
603 - Yeah.\\
604 - I'd be a fine husband\\
605 - if I didn't trust my wife any more
than that.\\
606 - (shouting:)
Lucy!\\
607 - Lucy, open the door!\\
608 - Open the door!\\
609 - Now, now, Ricky, I know this looks
bad\\
610 - and I can explain...\\
611 - I think.\\
612 - Lucy, you here, dressed in that.\\
613 - You must be out of your mind.\\
614 - ETHEL: Who is it, Lucy?\\
615 - Did Eddie come back?\\
616 - Ethel!\\
617 - You here, dressed in that.\\
618 - He must be out of his mind.\\
619 - Lucy, did they think that we...\\
620 - that I...?\\
621 - Well.\\
622 - Now, now, Ricky, this is all very
simple\\
623 - and I can explain it if you'll just
listen.\\
624 - Okay.\\
625 - Go ahead.\\
626 - Go ahead.\\
627 - Well, even though you told me not to,\\
628 - I fixed Eddie up with a date with
Sylvia for lunch\\
629 - and then Sylvia couldn't make it\\
630 - and we called Eddie and he wasn't in\\
631 - so I came down to the hotel to tell
Eddie\\
632 - and then you saw us and got mad\\
633 - so I had to come down again today and
tell Eddie\\
634 - and we called Sylvia and Eddie went
over to get her\\
635 - and while he was gone\\
636 - he said if we found some negligees
that we wanted\\
637 - we could have them wholesale.\\
638 - That's exactly what happened.\\
639 - And it was all my fault and I'm
sorry.\\
640 - You told me not to meddle in other
people's affairs\\
641 - and I did and I'm really sorry.\\
642 - That is the most ridiculous story
I've ever heard.\\
643 - Isn't it, Fred?\\
644 - I'll say.\\
645 - Well, that makes me mad.\\
646 - It makes you mad?\\
647 - Yes, I tell you the truth,\\
648 - I admit it's all my fault,\\
649 - I practically grovel at your feet\\
650 - and you say you don't believe it.\\
651 - Come on, come on, tell the real
story.\\
652 - Yeah.\\
653 - All right, Ethel.\\
654 - If they want the real story,\\
655 - let's give it to them.\\
656 - Huh?\\
657 - They want the truth.\\
658 - Let's give it to them.\\
659 - Go ahead.\\
660 - Oh.\\
661 - Well...\\
662 - Uh...\\
663 - You start.\\
664 - Well, for a long time now\\
665 - Ethel and I have been sick and tired\\
666 - of being married to a stale bongo
player\\
667 - and a fat old fuddy-duddy.\\
668 - A fat old fuddy-duddy?\\
669 - A fat old fuddy-duddy.\\
670 - So when Eddie Grant came to town,\\
671 - we realized that...\\
672 - that here was the chance of a
lifetime.\\
673 - And then what happened?\\
674 - Uh...\\
675 - And then what happened will amaze
you.\\
676 - Yeah.\\
677 - So the three of us made plans.\\
678 - And at midnight tonight,\\
679 - we're all flying to South America.\\
680 - You were, huh?\\
681 - What's so funny?\\
682 - What are you laughing at?\\
683 - What are you laughing at?\\
684 - Look, I ran into Eddie Grant
downstairs\\
685 - and I straightened him out but good.\\
686 - So we decided to come up here\\
687 - and teach you a lesson.\\
688 - Oh, Ricky...\\
689 - That's mean.\\
690 - That's mean.\\
691 - (all laughing)\\
692 - Come on, Ethel, let's change.\\
693 - Okay.\\
694 - Hey, do you think maybe\\
695 - we've suffered enough\\
696 - so that you fellows\\
697 - might buy us these negligees,
wholesale?\\
698 - How much are they?\\
699 - 139.50.\\
700 - 98.50.\\
701 - Good-bye, Lucy.\\
702 - Good-bye, Ethel.\\
703 - What do you mean, "good-bye"?\\
704 - Too much money.\\
705 - We decided to let you go to South
America.\\
706 - Oh, Fred.\\

2 - (crying)\\
3 - Shh!\\
4 - (crying)\\
5 - Shh... there we go.\\
6 - (no voice)\\
7 - (no voice)\\
8 - (no voice)\\
9 - (no voice)\\
10 - Honey, isn't it wonderful\\
11 - that little Ricky has his own room\\
12 - and we got all this space here?\\
13 - Yeah, wonderful, dear.\\
14 - I'm sure glad you talked me into
moving.\\
15 - So am I.\\
16 - Look at this beautiful place.\\
17 - Oh, everything is just great.\\
18 - Ugh!\\
19 - What's the matter?\\
20 - That ratty old couch\\
21 - and that nasty-looking coffee table--\\
22 - they just don't belong in this
beautiful room.\\
23 - Lucy, what's on your mind?\\
24 - Nothing... nothing.\\
25 - Now that you mention it, though, I
did see an ad today\\
26 - for the most beautiful couch and
coffee table you've ever seen.\\
27 - The couch was a three-piece...\\
28 - No new couch, no new coffee table.\\
29 - Finish, closed.\\
30 - Aw, gee, Ricky,\\
31 - you should look at this ad.\\
32 - It's the most beautiful couch\\
33 - and coffee table you've ever seen.\\
34 - It's only $299, and...\\
35 - Just forget it.\\
36 - So, what are you doing that for?\\
37 - I may have to live with that couch\\
38 - but I don't have to look at it.\\
39 - I think any normal person feels the
way I do.\\
40 - I'll bet Ethel Mertz thinks\\
41 - that those two pieces are just awful.\\
42 - I'd be ashamed to.\\
43 - Hi, folks.\\
44 - Hiya, Fred.\\
45 - Hi, Lucy.\\
46 - Hi, Ethel.\\
47 - Ugh!\\
48 - Oh, that ratty old couch\\
49 - and that nasty old coffee table--\\
50 - they just don't belong in this...\\
51 - Hold it, hold it, hold it, Ethel.\\
52 - The performance has been canceled.\\
53 - No new furniture.\\
54 - Why not?\\
55 - Ask Mr. Ricardo.\\
56 - Or as he is more commonly known,
SeÃ±or Tightwad.\\
57 - All right, I'll tell you what I'll
do.\\
58 - I'll leave it up to an impartial
observer.\\
59 - Fred, what do you think\\
60 - of this couch and this coffee table?\\
61 - What are you looking for?\\
62 - The price tag-- it's brand-new, isn't
it?\\
63 - Isn't it sickening the way men stick
together?\\
64 - Come on, Ethel, I don't like\\
65 - the atmosphere around here.\\
66 - "Brand-new, is it?
Where's the price tag?"\\
67 - "Brand-new."\\
68 - Well, it was a good fight, Lucy, but
you lost.\\
69 - Gee, Ethel, this is terrible.\\
70 - What am I going to do?\\
71 - What do you mean, what are you going
to do?\\
72 - He isn't going to buy you any new
furniture\\
73 - so you'll just have to live with the
old.\\
74 - You don't understand.\\
75 - I went down to the furniture store
this afternoon\\
76 - and, well, there was a big sale on
and...\\
77 - You didn't.\\
78 - Yes, I did.\\
79 - They're delivering it in the morning.\\
80 - Oh, Lucy!\\
81 - Do you suppose they accept mothers
with children\\
82 - in the Foreign Legion?\\
83 - Ethel, where have you been?\\
84 - I've been trying to find you all day.\\
85 - I had some shopping to do...\\
86 - Oh, Lucy!\\
87 - Oh, it's just beautiful!\\
88 - No, Ethel!\\
89 - What's the matter?\\
90 - Don't sit on it!\\
91 - Well, that's what it's for, isn't it?\\
92 - Well, I know, but it's much too
pretty to sit on.\\
93 - Well, all right, but gently, huh?\\
94 - Ha-ha!
It's comfy, too.\\
95 - Isn't that wonderful?\\
96 - You should see the close call I had
this morning.\\
97 - Ricky no sooner closed that door\\
98 - than they delivered the furniture.\\
99 - They must have passed each other in
the hall.\\
100 - Oh, what are you going to do when he
comes home?\\
101 - Pray.\\
102 - Well, good-bye, Lucy,\\
103 - it's been nice knowing you.\\
104 - Now...\\
105 - The only plan I have is to hide the
furniture.\\
106 - Hide it?\\
107 - Yeah, that way, if he doesn't see it
the minute he walks in,\\
108 - I may have a chance to soften him up,
you know.\\
109 - Where are you going to hide all this
stuff?\\
110 - Well, the bedroom is no good.\\
111 - The bathroom... no.\\
112 - Won't fit in that closet.\\
113 - Let's put it in the kitchen.\\
114 - He doesn't go in there very often.\\
115 - In the kitchen?\\
116 - Yeah, it's the only place.\\
117 - Come on, help me, will you?\\
118 - Okay.\\
119 - Get a hold of the other end.\\
120 - That's right, now, all together:\\
121 - one, two, three, four!\\
122 - Oh!
Oh!\\
123 - Oh, I forgot, it's in sections.\\
124 - Just help me with this piece.\\
125 - All right.\\
126 - There.\\
127 - Ready?\\
128 - Yeah.\\
129 - Oh, come on, push, Ethel!\\
130 - I am pushing.\\
131 - Well, push harder.\\
132 - There must be something in the way.\\
133 - Yeah, my fingers.\\
134 - Well, I don't understand.\\
135 - We got the other two sections out
here all right.\\
136 - What's the matter?\\
137 - I'm coming around to your side and
help you push.\\
138 - Maybe that'll do it.\\
139 - Where are you going?\\
140 - I'm going through your apartment.\\
141 - Okay, now, let's both have at it.\\
142 - All right, now level off.\\
143 - There it goes... oh.\\
144 - Go that way.\\
145 - (grunting)\\
146 - It's stuck again.\\
147 - Yeah, it's stuck on the edge of the
sink.\\
148 - Oh...\\
149 - Look, I can get the door closed;\\
150 - that'll at least hide it.\\
151 - Let's get your old furniture and put
it back\\
152 - so Ricky won't suspect anything.\\
153 - All right.\\
154 - I'll help you push it out here.\\
155 - Watch out for your hands.\\
156 - Okay.\\
157 - There.\\
158 - There we are.\\
159 - Now, where's the rest of your
furniture?\\
160 - Lucy?\\
161 - Where's your old couch and coffee
table?\\
162 - They took it in the down payment for
the new stuff.\\
163 - You just going to leave\\
164 - this great big hole in the room?\\
165 - Well, it's better than having a great
big hole in my head.\\
166 - That's what would happen if Ricky
came home\\
167 - and saw all that new furniture.\\
168 - Can I stick around and watch?\\
169 - No.\\
170 - Why don't you sell tickets?\\
171 - This is going to be the best fight\\
172 - since Dempsey fought Willard.\\
173 - I know what I'll do--\\
174 - I'll serve dinner out here.\\
175 - That'll hide the fact\\
176 - that some of the furniture is
missing.\\
177 - How you going to get in and out of
the kitchen?\\
178 - Oh...\\
179 - I won't-- I'll have everything we
need\\
180 - right out on the table before we
start.\\
181 - Oh, I haven't got much time.\\
182 - Will you get the card table out of
the closet?\\
183 - And the tablecloth, too.\\
184 - Oh!\\
185 - Hi, honey!\\
186 - Oh, hi, dear.\\
187 - Did you have a nice day?\\
188 - Yeah, wonderful, honey.\\
189 - That's good.\\
190 - Well!\\
191 - Oh, I thought we'd eat\\
192 - in the living room tonight, dear.\\
193 - You know, it's nice and cozy and
comfy.\\
194 - Sure, that's a wonderful idea.\\
195 - What happened?
Something's missing.\\
196 - It is?\\
197 - The couch and the coffee table are
gone!\\
198 - Oh, so they are.\\
199 - Well, where are they?\\
200 - Gee, I don't know, they were here a
minute ago.\\
201 - I wonder where they went.\\
202 - Here, couch, here, coffee table!\\
203 - Here, coffee table!\\
204 - (whistling)\\
205 - Here, coffee table, here, coffee
table!\\
206 - Lucy...\\
207 - What have you done with the couch and
the coffee table?\\
208 - I sold them.\\
209 - I'd rather have nothing\\
210 - than look at that junk.\\
211 - Uh-huh... I can see through your
little scheme.\\
212 - I know what you've done.\\
213 - You do?\\
214 - You figured that if you sold the old
stuff,\\
215 - I'm going to buy you some new
furniture.\\
216 - Well, now that you mention it,\\
217 - that was my little scheme.\\
218 - It won't work.\\
219 - Well, I'm glad I didn't spend\\
220 - too much time on it, then.\\
221 - Well, let's talk about it after
dinner, huh?\\
222 - After dinner.\\
223 - Yeah.\\
224 - All right.\\
225 - Oh.\\
226 - You see, it's kind of nice having
dinner\\
227 - in the living room for a change,\\
228 - don't you think?\\
229 - I think so...
looks good, too.\\
230 - Where's the butter?\\
231 - Butter?\\
232 - Yeah, butter.\\
233 - What do you want to do with it?\\
234 - I thought I'd put some on my bread.\\
235 - Butter on bread?\\
236 - Yeah.\\
237 - I'll never get used to your strange
Cuban dishes.\\
238 - Okay, I'll get it myself.\\
239 - Mmm!\\
240 - Never mind, I'll get it.\\
241 - Where are you going?\\
242 - Uh... uh, I'm all out of butter.\\
243 - I'll have to borrow some from Ethel.\\
244 - Butter.\\
245 - Thanks a lot, Ethel.\\
246 - Good old Ethel-- I don't know what
I'd do without her.\\
247 - Well, thank you, honey.\\
248 - That's all right.\\
249 - Steak sure looks good.\\
250 - Yeah.\\
251 - Honey, these are the wrong kind of
knives.\\
252 - Can I have a steak knife?\\
253 - Steak knife?\\
254 - Yes.\\
255 - Oh, here, I'll cut it for you.\\
256 - No, thank you, Mother,\\
257 - just get me a steak knife, huh?\\
258 - Oh, you don't need a steak knife.\\
259 - Just pick it up in your fingers like
this.\\
260 - It's good for your teeth.\\
261 - Nice and strong.\\
262 - No?\\
263 - I'll get a steak knife.\\
264 - Now where are you going?\\
265 - Well, we... we... we, uh...\\
266 - Our steak knives are very dull.\\
267 - I'll have to get Ethel's.\\
268 - (tapping on table)\\
269 - (running footsteps)\\
270 - Steak knife.\\
271 - Oh, thank you.\\
272 - Salt cellar is empty.\\
273 - Ooh!\\
274 - Will you get me some, please?\\
275 - Well, uh... I, uh...\\
276 - I loaned Ethel our salt.\\
277 - I'll have to go get some.\\
278 - I wish you'd told me sooner.\\
279 - (screams)\\
280 - Now, Ricky...\\
281 - Okay...\\
282 - Let's have it.\\
283 - I don't mean that.\\
284 - You deliberately went out and bought
that furniture\\
285 - after I told you not to.\\
286 - No, I didn't.\\
287 - I bought it before you told me not
to.\\
288 - And who did you think was going to
pay for it?\\
289 - Well, I was hoping that a certain
handsome, generous,\\
290 - kind, generous, wonderful, generous
husband\\
291 - whom we all know and love...\\
292 - Lucy...\\
293 - You going to take that stuff back\\
294 - to the furniture store tomorrow
morning,\\
295 - do you understand?\\
296 - Well, yes, sir, I understand,\\
297 - but I don't know that the store will.\\
298 - I got it on sale.\\
299 - Oh... you got it on sale.\\
300 - Yes, sir.\\
301 - All right... do you know what I'm
going to do?\\
302 - Yes... Do you mind if I close my
eyes?\\
303 - I can't stand the sight of blood.\\
304 - Never mind that.\\
305 - As long as we have to keep that
furniture,\\
306 - you are going to pay for it out of
your allowance.\\
307 - Oh, Ricky, that's wonderful!\\
308 - Just a minute.\\
309 - I'll pay the store for it.\\
310 - and I'll pay you.\\
311 - Right.\\
312 - But I'm taking it to the club\\
313 - and putting it in my office.\\
314 - When you save enough money,\\
315 - you can buy it back from me.\\
316 - Oh, Ricky, that's $299.\\
317 - I'll be an old lady before I save
that much money.\\
318 - Well, at least you know\\
319 - that you're going to have\\
320 - a nice sectional couch\\
321 - to rest on in your old age.\\
322 - Well, that's true.\\
323 - You can save it; you can save the
money.\\
324 - All you got to do is to learn how to
economize.\\
325 - You waste a lot of money\\
326 - out of your allowance every month.\\
327 - You've got to learn the value of a
dollar, Lucy.\\
328 - You'll be surprised how soon you can
save that much money.\\
329 - But I want the furniture now.\\
330 - The place looks awful without it.\\
331 - Well, I can stand it; it doesn't
bother me.\\
332 - You'll get the furniture when I get
my money.\\
333 - All right, Ricky, I'll buy it back
from you.\\
334 - I'll economize-- you wait and see.\\
335 - Good.\\
336 - Salt?\\
337 - Thank you.\\
338 - Morning, honey.\\
339 - Oh, good morning, dear.\\
340 - Breakfast is all ready.\\
341 - Good, I'm starved.\\
342 - What is this?\\
343 - That's your orange juice.\\
344 - We're economizing, dear.\\
345 - We're cutting down on everything.\\
346 - Oh, but don't worry, we have eggs and
sausage coming up.\\
347 - Well, they were in here someplace.\\
348 - Oh, there you are!\\
349 - See this?\\
350 - This makes it seem like more-- see,
dear?\\
351 - Lucy, now, you listen...\\
352 - Oh, I forgot the toast.\\
353 - Want some butter on it?\\
354 - Lucy, I am not amused.\\
355 - No?\\
356 - No-- when I told you to economize,\\
357 - I didn't mean by starving me to
death.\\
358 - You leave me the way I am.\\
359 - Cut down on some of your
"stravagances."\\
360 - What kind of "stravagances"?\\
361 - You know what kind--\\
362 - like going to the beauty parlor\\
363 - and buying too many clothes.\\
364 - And cleaning.\\
365 - Yeah, cleaning--\\
366 - the dry cleaning bills in this place
are ridiculous.\\
367 - Well, you don't have to worry, dear;
I thought about that.\\
368 - I'm cleaning all of your dirty suits
here at home.\\
369 - My suits!\\
370 - Yeah, I've already started--\\
371 - there's one in the sink.\\
372 - Oh, no, you didn't.\\
373 - You didn't put one of my good... in
the sink...\\
374 - Yeah.\\
375 - Oh, no, Lucy, it's ruined!\\
376 - Look at this!\\
377 - Don't worry, dear, I was practicing\\
378 - on one of your old suits.\\
379 - Okay.\\
380 - Just for being so smart,\\
381 - that is going to cost you another
$100.\\
382 - You now owe me $399.\\
383 - Would you care to shoot for $400?\\
384 - You can't charge me $100 for a stale
old suit.\\
385 - Can't I?\\
386 - Aw, Ricky, please\\
387 - I'll be serious, I'll economize.\\
388 - I won't buy any more clothes\\
389 - and I'll stop going to the beauty
parlor--\\
390 - after Saturday night.\\
391 - What do you mean, after Saturday
night?\\
392 - Well, the Carrolls are giving that
big party\\
393 - at the club-- you know.\\
394 - I have to have a new dress\\
395 - and I'll get my farewell permanent.\\
396 - No.\\
397 - No?\\
398 - Well, if I make my dress myself, can
I get the permanent?\\
399 - No.\\
400 - No?\\
401 - Well, if I give myself a permanent,\\
402 - can I buy the dress?\\
403 - No.\\
404 - Well, if I give myself the permanent\\
405 - and make the dress myself, will you
go back to $299?\\
406 - Yeah, that I'll do.\\
407 - If you do that, that means that you
mean business.\\
408 - I only hope that you're serious.\\
409 - Oh, I am, I am, Ricky, I'm serious.\\
410 - Can't you tell by the way I look?\\
411 - Hi, honey.\\
412 - Hi.\\
413 - How you doing?\\
414 - Oh, fine, I've got my dress almost
all cut out.\\
415 - What are you cutting with?\\
416 - A razor blade.\\
417 - A razor blade!\\
418 - Why don't you use scissors?\\
419 - Well, I tried to,\\
420 - but they wouldn't cut.\\
421 - Manicuring scissors.\\
422 - Well, that's all I had.\\
423 - Gee, I sure am impressed.\\
424 - I never made a dress in my life.\\
425 - Oh, there's nothing to it.\\
426 - How's your home permanent coming?\\
427 - Okay, I guess.\\
428 - Oh, boy!\\
429 - Hey, how about that?\\
430 - I rented that sewing machine.\\
431 - Isn't that a dilly?\\
432 - You know how to run it?\\
433 - Oh, sure, it's simple.\\
434 - The booklet says even a child could
operate it.\\
435 - Let's see.\\
436 - "First thread the bobbin."\\
437 - Do you have any idea what a bobbin
looks like?\\
438 - I'd better turn it on-- maybe I can
tell that way.\\
439 - Oh... that must be it-- it's bobbin'
up and down.\\
440 - Hey, Lucy, look at this chart.\\
441 - That's not the bobbin at all.\\
442 - Ethel, will you go home?\\
443 - Why?\\
444 - I want to make this dress all by
myself\\
445 - And I want to surprise you.\\
446 - Oh, okay, I'll see you later.\\
447 - Okay, come back in a couple of hours.\\
448 - All right.\\
449 - Lucy?\\
450 - Just a minute, Mrs. Mertz!\\
451 - I'm trying on my new dress!\\
452 - Hurry up, I can hardly wait to see
it.\\
453 - What do you think?\\
454 - I give up, what is it?\\
455 - Pretty bad, isn't it?\\
456 - I was hoping it would look different\\
457 - when I tried it on.\\
458 - Well, it's different, all right.\\
459 - Well, you don't have to get nasty
about it.\\
460 - After all, I made it with my own two
hands.\\
461 - It looks like you made it with your
own two feet.\\
462 - If it weren't so true, I'd get mad at
that.\\
463 - (key turning in lock)\\
464 - How are you, Fred?\\
465 - All right, thanks.\\
466 - Hi!\\
467 - Hi, Lucy.\\
468 - Hi.\\
469 - What's the matter with you?\\
470 - Honey, what are you doing?\\
471 - She's got on the dress she made.\\
472 - Oh, come on, let us see it.\\
473 - Yeah, come on out\\
474 - and let's see the new creation.\\
475 - No.\\
476 - Oh, come on, Lucy, you might as well.\\
477 - (both laughing)\\
478 - (laughing)\\
479 - (wailing)\\
480 - Oh...\\
481 - (wailing)\\
482 - Oh, honey...
come on, sweetheart.\\
483 - Don't cry, honey.\\
484 - It's tough making a dress,\\
485 - and this is your first try.\\
486 - Well, I wanted it to be so nice so I
could save money.\\
487 - You saved money by giving yourself a
home permanent.\\
488 - Well, I don't...\\
489 - My permanent!\\
490 - I forgot all about it!\\
491 - ETHEL: Oh, my goodness!\\
492 - It's only supposed to be on 20
minutes.\\
493 - RICKY: How long has it been on?\\
494 - Five hours!\\
495 - That's the funniest dress\\
496 - I ever saw in my life.\\
497 - Oh, now, you guys shouldn't have made
fun of her.\\
498 - She worked awful hard cutting that
out.\\
499 - (laughing)\\
500 - ETHEL: Wasn't that something?\\
501 - It looked like a sack of potatoes\\
502 - tied in the middle.\\
503 - Oh, Fred, she tried real hard.\\
504 - Oh, I can't...\\
505 - Oh, we got to stop, it'd be awful...\\
506 - No, no, now\\
507 - she can't come back out\\
508 - and find us all laughing.\\
509 - Now, quiet down.\\
510 - All right.\\
511 - Oh, honey...\\
512 - Well, Little Orphan Annie.\\
513 - Oh, honey, what a shame.\\
514 - It's all right, I've always wanted\\
515 - to look like a chrysanthemum.\\
516 - Don't cry, sweetheart\\
517 - Don't cry.\\
518 - There must be something you can do.\\

show.\\
520 - (wailing)\\
521 - Now, honey...\\
522 - Lucy, you can go to the beauty parlor
tomorrow\\
523 - and maybe they can fix it up.\\
524 - I can't go to the beauty parlor-- I
can't afford it.\\
525 - Yes, you can, honey.\\
526 - I can?\\
527 - Yes... you can go to the beauty
parlor,\\
528 - and you can buy yourself a new dress.\\
529 - Oh, Ricky, really?\\
530 - As a matter of fact, you look so sad\\
531 - I'll bring the couch and the coffee
table back home.\\
532 - Oh, honey, Oh, thank you!\\
533 - Do you forgive me for everything?\\
534 - Yes, sweetheart, everything.\\
535 - Oh, the furniture and the dress\\
536 - and the suit and the rug?\\
537 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
538 - Wait a minute-- the rug?\\
539 - Yeah...
remember you said\\
540 - you forgave me for everything.\\
541 - I know, I forgive you for everything,\\
542 - that's all right,\\
543 - but what is this about the rug?\\
544 - Well, when I cut out my dress,\\
545 - I guess I cut\\
546 - a little too deep.\\
547 - Oh!\\

\subsection {Episode 29: The Camping Trip}
1 - (I Love Lucy theme music plays)\\
2 - It's your lead, Lucy.\\
3 - -I know it.
-Play it while you're still young.\\
4 - You leave her alone.\\
5 - This is important.\\
6 - Oh, how did you know to lead hearts?\\
7 - Ah, just a good guess!\\
8 - That's mine, that's mine!\\
9 - Down two, double and redouble.\\
10 - That'll take a lot of figuring.\\
11 - Oh, say, have you heard about Joanne?\\
12 - No, what about her?\\
13 - They're getting a separation.\\
14 - Joanne and Greg?\\
15 - Oh, honestly!
Is that true?\\
16 - You're kidding, Caroline!\\
17 - They decided they no longer had
anything in common.\\
18 - He claimed she was so wrapped up in
the children,\\
19 - she didn't care about him.\\
20 - If that's true, then it's her fault.\\
21 - She claimed he came home and buried
himself in the paper\\
22 - and didn't want her to have any part
of his life.\\
23 - If that's true, then it's his fault.\\
24 - Aw, listen, it's both their fault,
and it's nobody's fault.\\
25 - It happens to every couple.\\
26 - There's nothing you can do about it.\\
27 - Why, Ethel Mertz, I'm ashamed to hear
you talk like that.\\
28 - That could never happen to Ricky and
me.\\
29 - Why, we just have everything in
common.\\
30 - Oh, come now, Lucy, every marriage
reaches a point\\
31 - where the honeymoon's over.\\
32 - Yeah, our honeymoon was over on our
honeymoon.\\
33 - I think you're all just terrible.\\
34 - Ricky and I never get bored with each
other.\\
35 - He's interested in everything that I
do\\
36 - and I'm interested in everything that
he does.\\
37 - and the honeymoon isn't over at all!\\
38 - Well, it isn't!\\
39 - Oh, come on, let's play cards.\\
40 - Oh, hi, dear.\\
41 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
42 - Uh... I had a pretty interesting day
today.\\
43 - Don't you want to hear about it?\\
44 - Uh-huh.\\
45 - Well, I took little Ricky to the park
this morning,\\
46 - and then this afternoon,\\
47 - Ethel and I had a bridge game and we
won.\\
48 - We won 25 cents.\\
49 - That's twelve and a half cents
apiece.\\
50 - That's wonderful, dear.\\
51 - What's that for?\\
52 - Ricky Ricardo, you put down that
paper.\\
53 - We're going to talk.\\
54 - Talk?\\
55 - Yes-- I say something, you say
something,\\
56 - then I say something, then you say
something and so on.\\
57 - Well, I am aware of the way it goes,
but why?\\
58 - Because we're married, and I don't
want you to come home\\
59 - and bury yourself in the paper like I
didn't exist.\\
60 - Oh, well, honey, that's a very good
reason.\\
61 - Okay.\\
62 - Let's talk.\\
63 - Well, that's better.\\
64 - Uh...\\
65 - How did rehearsal go today, dear?\\
66 - Fine.\\
67 - You told me that much before.\\
68 - Well, that's all.\\
69 - It went fine.\\
70 - You know, nothing went wrong.\\
71 - Everything was just... fine.\\
72 - Oh...\\
73 - What kind of a day did you have?\\
74 - Oh, fi... real good.\\
75 - Uh, this morning I took little Ricky
to the park\\
76 - and this afternoon Ethel and I had a
bridge game and we won.\\
77 - 25 cents.\\
78 - Oh, I told you that much before, too,
didn't I?\\
79 - Yeah.\\
80 - Uh...\\
81 - You start this time.\\
82 - Okay.
Um...\\
83 - What will we talk about?\\
84 - Anything-- anything you're interested
in,\\
85 - I'm interested in.\\
86 - Okay.\\
87 - Just pick a topic.\\
88 - Um...\\
89 - What do you think of the new tax law?\\
90 - Pick another topic.\\
91 - Well, aren't you interested in
anything else, dear?\\
92 - Right now I'm interested\\
93 - in reading my paper.\\
94 - Oh, well, go ahead.\\
95 - We'll both read it.\\
96 - Okay.\\
97 - There you are.\\
98 - Thank you.\\
99 - Why did you give me the society page?\\
100 - I want the sports page.\\
101 - The sports page?\\
102 - Sure! What do you think I am, a
square?\\
103 - I want to read the sports page.\\
104 - Well, I'll read it to you.\\
105 - Oh... all right.\\
106 - Who won the fight last night?\\
107 - The fights...\\
108 - Now, let's see.\\
109 - Uh...\\
110 - fight, fight, oh, here it is.\\
111 - "Williams bags crown by Tko in
eighth."\\
112 - "Tko"?\\
113 - Yeah, Tko, t-k-o.\\
114 - How else would you pronounce it?\\
115 - That's how you pronounce it-- t-k-o.\\
116 - It means technical knockout.\\
117 - Oh, of course, sure, sure.\\
118 - Well, how long has this been going
on?\\
119 - What?\\
120 - They're racing little girls at
Churchill Downs!\\
121 - What?\\
122 - It says so right here-- see?\\
123 - "First race won by three-year-old
maiden."\\
124 - Well, I wouldn't worry about that
little girl if I were you.\\
125 - She's as strong as a horse.\\
126 - Well, she certainly was carrying a
lot of money\\
127 - for a little girl.\\
128 - She had $2,000 in her purse.\\
129 - Thank you, Grantland Rice.\\
130 - What?\\
131 - Grantland Rice.\\
132 - You surely heard of Grantland Rice?\\
133 - Oh, sure, I've heard of it,\\
134 - but I've never tasted it.\\
135 - Yeah.\\
136 - Gee, isn't it fun reading the sports
page together?\\
137 - It's very enlightening.\\
138 - I've been reading the sport pages for
years,\\
139 - I never found any of that stuff in
there before.\\
140 - Well, you learn something every day.\\
141 - Maybe you can move over there\\
142 - and we can read it at the same time.\\
143 - Oh, sure.\\
144 - I'd like that.\\
145 - Sure.\\
146 - Okay.\\
147 - Isn't this fun, dear?\\
148 - Mm-hmm.\\
149 - We have a lot in common, don't we?\\
150 - Mmm.\\
151 - Oh, Ricky, it's so wonderful having
you around this morning.\\
152 - Didn't you like it?\\
153 - I sure did, honey.\\
154 - Oh, I sure did.\\
155 - I wish you could do it more often.\\
156 - Uh... will you let go of my arm long
enough\\
157 - to put my coat on?\\
158 - Oh, sure.\\
159 - Let me help you.\\
160 - Thank you.\\
161 - Remember now, honey\\
162 - if anything interesting happens to
you down at the club,\\
163 - be sure to tell me because I'm
interested\\
164 - in anything interesting that happens
to you.\\
165 - All right, honey, sure.\\
166 - Hi, Rick.\\
167 - Oh, hiya, Fred.\\
168 - I'm glad I caught you.\\
169 - What's up?\\
170 - I just heard from my brother\\
171 - and he's got everything all set\\
172 - for our camping trip.\\
173 - How's the last week in July for you?\\
174 - Oh, that sounds just great.\\
175 - Great. He's got the guide and the
pack train all set\\
176 - and he says the streams are so full
of trout\\
177 - that they jump in your pocket.\\
178 - Oh, boy!\\
179 - Oh, boy!\\
180 - I'll write and tell him okay, huh?\\
181 - Oh, sure.\\
182 - We wouldn't miss it for the world.\\
183 - Honey...\\
184 - (little Ricky crying)\\
185 - Oh, the baby.\\
186 - Honey, I'll be right back.\\
187 - Uh... the camping trip is going to be\\
188 - just wonderful, Fred.\\
189 - What camping trip?\\
190 - Oh, now, come on, Fred.\\
191 - No, no, no.\\
192 - If Lucy's going, Ethel will want to
go,\\
193 - and I could be miserable at home.\\
194 - Look, Fred, I'll talk her out of it.\\
195 - it's just that she's in a funny kind
of mood.\\
196 - She wants to do everything that I do.\\
197 - I don't know what's the matter with
her.\\
198 - Yeah, Ethel told me about that.\\
199 - Well, tell me, would you-- what's
cooking?\\
200 - Well, Lucy's been trying to prove\\
201 - to the gals in the bridge club\\
202 - that you two are not bored with each
other\\
203 - like other couples who've been
married\\
204 - as long as you have.\\
205 - Oh, that's it, huh?\\
206 - Well, that explains the whole deal.\\
207 - She's been sticking to me every
minute.\\
208 - It's like having a piece of gum stuck
to your shoe,\\
209 - you know?\\
210 - Well, you better try and scrape her
off\\
211 - before it's time to go on the camping
trip.\\
212 - Don't worry, Fred, I'll talk her out
of it.\\
213 - I'll think of something.\\
214 - Well, I hope so.\\
215 - Well, let's see, there must be some
way to do this.\\
216 - Hey...\\
217 - suppose I take her on a preview
camping trip.\\
218 - I don't quite get you.\\
219 - Well, I could play up all the
discomforts of camping--\\
220 - make her work her head off-- you
know, really rough it.\\
221 - By the time I'm through, she won't
want to go\\
222 - on another camping trip again.\\
223 - You've really got something there.\\
224 - Oh, gee, fellas, that camping just
sounds wonderful--\\
225 - that camping trip.\\
226 - I'll do all the cooking for us.\\
227 - Listen, honey, just to get you an
idea\\
228 - of what it's going to be like next
summer,\\
229 - I thought that maybe you and I should
go\\
230 - on a camping trip next weekend as a
rehearsal.\\
231 - Just the two of us, Ricky?\\
232 - Ethel and I can take care of the
baby.\\
233 - Oh, thank you.\\
234 - Oh, honey, that's wonderful!\\
235 - I'd just love it.\\
236 - Oh, honey!\\
237 - Lucy?\\
238 - LUCY: I'll be right there!\\
239 - Well, do I look like I stepped out of
Field and Stream?\\
240 - You look more like you fell in.\\
241 - Well!\\
242 - Never mind that.\\
243 - I've got news for you.\\
244 - What?\\
245 - Do you know why Ricky's taking you on
this little trip?\\
246 - I certainly do.\\
247 - Because we do everything together\\
248 - and because he can't stand being away
from me.\\
249 - Oh, no.\\
250 - What do you mean, "Oh, no"?\\
251 - He doesn't want you to go this
summer,\\
252 - so he's going to take you on this
little trip\\
253 - and make things so tough for you\\
254 - that you'll never want to go camping
again\\
255 - as long as you live.\\
256 - I don't believe that!\\
257 - I can't help it.\\
258 - I heard him talking\\
259 - when he came down to borrow Fred's
sleeping bag.\\
260 - He says he's sick and tired of you
and him\\
261 - being the Bobbsey twins.\\
262 - The Bobbsey...\\
263 - Well, that big...\\
264 - How do you like that.\\
265 - Lucy, when you tell Ricky you're not
going with him,\\
266 - don't mention that I...\\
267 - What do you mean, I'm not going?\\
268 - Well, are you?\\
269 - I certainly am.\\
270 - I'm going to beat him at his own
little game.\\
271 - What do you mean?\\
272 - Well, of course, I'll need the help\\
273 - of a very loyal friend, one who will
tell Fred\\
274 - that she's visiting her mother,\\
275 - but who in reality will be staying\\
276 - at a lodge nearby.\\
277 - Oh, no, I won't!\\
278 - Now, Ethel!\\
279 - I'm not going to do it!\\
280 - You haven't even heard my idea!\\
281 - You thought it up-- that's enough for
me!\\
282 - What kind of a friend are you?\\
283 - Every time you get an idea,\\
284 - I get dragged in on it somehow.\\
285 - Just answer me that--\\
286 - what kind of a friend are you?\\
287 - I always end up...\\
288 - I think it's right around here
someplace.\\
289 - Yeah, that's the spot right down
there.\\
290 - That's where the good fishing is.\\
291 - My feet hurt.\\
292 - Well, honey, I'm sorry, but you've
got to hike for miles\\
293 - before you get to the good fishing
spot.\\
294 - Your feet will feel better\\
295 - when you're standing in the water.\\
296 - Standing in the water?\\
297 - You got to walk right out into the
stream.\\
298 - How are we going to catch these
fish--\\
299 - by stepping on them?\\
300 - Don't mind that--\\
301 - that's the way that you fish for
trout.\\
302 - Oh.\\
303 - So you got to go right into the
stream\\
304 - and stand in the water there,\\
305 - and you stand there for hours and
hours.\\
306 - Water is cold-- freezing.\\
307 - Maybe you want to call the whole
thing off.\\
308 - It's too much for you?\\
309 - No, no...\\
310 - Too much for me? Pooh!\\
311 - What's a little cold water?\\
312 - Listen, Ricky, do you think\\
313 - this measly little basket is big
enough\\
314 - for all the fish I'm going to catch?\\
315 - Oh, well, I wouldn't worry about that
if I were you.\\
316 - No?\\
317 - No, usually the first time that you
come out,\\
318 - you don't catch anything, except
maybe a cold\\
319 - or a mosquito bite, or frostbitten
feet.\\
320 - Oh.\\
321 - Well, come on, let's go.\\
322 - Listen, Ricky, let's not fish
together.\\
323 - Let's, uh, separate\\
324 - and see who catches the most.\\
325 - Well, don't be silly, now, come on.\\
326 - No, no, really, you know how fish
are.\\
327 - No, how are they?\\
328 - Well, they're shy.\\
329 - If there's too many people around,\\
330 - the fish just won't stay-- they go.\\
331 - Okay, we'll go downstreams a way\\
332 - and then we'll separate.\\
333 - Well, I think I'll go upstreams a
way.\\
334 - Look, I've been here a hundred times\\
335 - and there's no good spot up there.\\
336 - There's no fish up there.\\
337 - Oh, I don't know.\\
338 - It looks pretty fishy up there to me.\\
339 - Okay, have it your own way.\\
340 - I'll meet you back here in one hour.\\
341 - Okay.\\
342 - All right.\\
343 - Watch out for bears!\\
344 - Bears!\\
345 - (bushes rustling)\\
346 - (whispers:)
Ethel?\\
347 - Ethel?\\
348 - (both scream)\\
349 - Oh!\\
350 - I thought you were a bear.\\
351 - Huh?\\
352 - Did you get the fish?\\
353 - One dozen of the best trout\\
354 - that they had at the fish market.\\
355 - Good.\\
356 - No, don't give them to me.\\
357 - Throw them to me.\\
358 - Throw them to you?\\
359 - I want to be able to tell Ricky I
caught them.\\
360 - Oh.\\
361 - Okay.\\
362 - Ooh!\\
363 - Oh, they're beauties.\\
364 - How'd you get here?\\
365 - I trailed you like an Indian.\\
366 - That was some walk, wasn't it?\\
367 - Not for me.\\
368 - I borrowed a station wagon from the
lodge.\\
369 - I've trailed you all the way from
your campsite.\\
370 - It's parked back down the road.\\
371 - Hey, that gives me an idea.\\
372 - What?\\
373 - Go back in the car and wait for me.\\
374 - What are you going to do?\\
375 - I'll tell you later.\\
376 - Just go in the car and wait for me on
the road.\\
377 - Don't let anybody see you.\\
378 - Okay.\\
379 - Say "Ah."\\
380 - RICKY: Lucy?\\
381 - (whistles)\\
382 - (answers)\\
383 - (whistles again)\\
384 - (answers)\\
385 - (whistles)\\
386 - (answers)\\
387 - Oh, there you are.\\
388 - I don't blame you for quitting.\\
389 - The fish are really not biting today.\\
390 - Oh, haven't you caught any yet?\\
391 - And how many did you caught?\\
392 - Well, I didn't have very much luck.\\
393 - That's what I thought.\\
394 - Only these.\\
395 - You catch all those?\\
396 - Yes, sir.\\
397 - I certainly did.\\
398 - What did you use for bait?\\
399 - Bait?\\
400 - Yeah, didn't you put anything on the
hook?\\
401 - No, no.\\
402 - I just threw the hook in\\
403 - and then when all the fish jumped on,\\
404 - I just pulled them out.\\
405 - Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
406 - Well, we better get back to camp.\\
407 - How do you feel?\\
408 - Tired, huh?\\
409 - Well, yeah, those fish put up quite a
fight.\\
410 - Well, I'm sorry, but we're going to
have to keep\\
411 - a pretty good brisk pace back to
camp,\\
412 - or we'll never make it back there by
night.\\
413 - Well, don't worry, I'll keep up with
you.\\
414 - I hope you're able to.\\
415 - Able to? I'll tell you what I'll do--\\
416 - I'll race you back to camp.\\
417 - Race me back to camp?\\
418 - Yeah.\\
419 - (laughs)\\
420 - You've been standing out in the heat
too long.\\
421 - Well, nevertheless I'll race you\\
422 - and I'll bet you five dollars\\
423 - that I'll beat you back.\\
424 - Are you game?\\
425 - Okay, I'll just take you up on that.\\
426 - And because you're a woman,\\
427 - I'll give you a head start.\\
428 - Well, because I'm a woman,\\
429 - I'll take it.\\
430 - Hey, you keep up that pace, you won't
last a mile.\\
431 - Slow down!\\
432 - Isn't this a beautiful night?\\
433 - Yeah.\\
434 - What time is it?\\
435 - Eight o'clock.\\
436 - Three hours, what do you think is
keeping Ricky?\\
437 - Give him time.\\
438 - He didn't have me waiting in a
station wagon\\
439 - to bring him back like you did.\\
440 - Here he comes!
Hurry up!\\
441 - Be sure and meet me right here\\
442 - in the morning.\\
443 - Don't forget!\\
444 - Keep out of sight!\\
445 - What took you so long, dear?\\
446 - Great day for a hike, wasn't it?\\
447 - (mumbles)\\
448 - Nothing like a hike\\
449 - to tone up those old muscles, eh?\\
450 - Ricky, say something.\\
451 - Water!\\
452 - Of course, dear.\\
453 - (grunts)\\
454 - Oh, I'm sorry, dear.\\
455 - I must have used it all up.\\
456 - You see, I got back so early,\\
457 - I had time to wash my hair.\\
458 - Look, honey, if you're so tired\\
459 - you'd better go to bed, huh.\\
460 - -Yeah.
-Come on.\\
461 - That a boy.\\
462 - Remember, you promised to take me
hunting\\
463 - at 5:00 in the morning.\\
464 - Oh, no.\\
465 - Okay, I'm all ready to go hunting.\\
466 - All right.\\
467 - I'll get the guns.\\
468 - Okay.\\
469 - (whispers:)
Ethel?\\
470 - Ethel?\\
471 - Ethel?\\
472 - ETHEL: Here I am.\\
473 - Where?\\
474 - Here.\\
475 - Where?\\
476 - Here.\\
477 - Where?\\
478 - Up here.\\
479 - How did you get up there?\\
480 - It wasn't easy.\\
481 - Where have you got the horseshoe
nailed up?\\
482 - Over there on that tree.\\
483 - Where?\\
484 - Over there.\\
485 - Way over there?\\
486 - I can hardly see it.\\
487 - Don't worry, you'll hit it every
time.\\
488 - Let's hear how it's going to sound.\\
489 - (loud clang)\\
490 - Shh!\\
491 - That's fine.\\
492 - Remember now, I'm depending on you.\\
493 - Yeah.\\
494 - How about the ducks?\\
495 - Everything's under control.\\
496 - Okay.\\
497 - Are you sure you want to go hunting?\\
498 - Sure, I want to go.\\
499 - Which gun is mine, that one?\\
500 - Yeah. You know how to use one of
these things?\\
501 - Do I know how to use one of these
things.\\
502 - You see that horseshoe over there?\\
503 - Where?\\
504 - Right over there.\\
505 - Way over there?\\
506 - Don't tell me you're going to hit
that.\\
507 - Watch this.\\
508 - The trigger is the one behind there.\\
509 - Oh... oh, it's that kind of a gun,
huh?\\
510 - Yeah.\\
511 - (metal clangs)\\
512 - I don't believe it.\\
513 - Now, with my eyes closed.\\
514 - (metal clangs)\\
515 - Over my shoulder.\\
516 - Aha, you missed that time.\\
517 - Well, anybody could miss...\\
518 - (metal clangs)\\
519 - One of my slow ones.\\
520 - What's going on around here?\\
521 - Now, Ricky, look,\\
522 - That's enough target practice.\\
523 - What's say we start hunting, huh?\\
524 - I bet I get more ducks than you do.\\
525 - Ducks?\\
526 - Yeah, you know, birds flying over.\\
527 - (quacking)\\
528 - Well, there isn't one duck\\
529 - within 100 miles of here.\\
530 - Oh, I don't know.\\
531 - These look like pretty good duck
trees to me.\\
532 - This might come as a surprise to you,
Lucy,\\
533 - but you find ducks on the water,\\
534 - not up in the trees.\\
535 - Well, I'm sure I saw...\\
536 - Oh, there they are!\\
537 - There they are!\\
538 - Watch it, watch it!\\
539 - Watch it, watch it!\\
540 - You know, that's pretty good
shooting.\\
541 - Not only did you kill the duck,\\
542 - but you knocked his feathers off\\
543 - and you cleaned it, too.\\
544 - Yeah, well, that's enough duck
hunting.\\
545 - Let's do something else.\\
546 - Now, wait a minute.\\
547 - I think you're right.\\
548 - I think there's a lot of ducks here.\\
549 - No, no.\\
550 - Oh, I think so.\\
551 - I don't think there's any.\\
552 - Look, there's a nice big fat one\\
553 - right over there.\\
554 - Don't shoot, Ricky, it's me!\\
555 - Ethel, you get out of that tree!\\
556 - Okay.\\
557 - What are you doing up in there?\\
558 - I was just looking at the view.\\
559 - Never mind that, get out of there!\\
560 - Oh...\\
561 - You come here!\\
562 - Ethel, what's the matter with you,\\
563 - getting ducks that are all cleaned
and plucked?\\
564 - I didn't unwrap the package\\
565 - till I got up in the tree\\
566 - and then it was too late.\\
567 - Oh!\\
568 - So Ethel has been here all the time,
huh?\\
569 - Well, that explains a lot of things.\\
570 - Does it explain why you brought me up
here\\
571 - just to make me hate camping?\\
572 - That has nothing...\\
573 - Oh, you knew about that?\\
574 - Yeah, I knew about that.\\
575 - Oh.\\
576 - (snickering)\\
577 - Well, I guess this makes us even,
huh?\\
578 - Oh, all right, Ricky.\\
579 - I'm sorry.\\
580 - You know, I really don't want\\
581 - to share everything with you.\\
582 - You dun't?\\
583 - No, I "dun't."\\
584 - Just certain things.\\
585 - Like this.\\

3 - TV ANNOUNCER: Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen.\\
4 - Here we are once again from the
Rainbow Arena\\
5 - bringing you a 15-round bout for the
championship.\\

a wonderful turnout\\
7 - here at the largest stadium in the
East.\\
8 - We can see many celebrities.\\
9 - The weather is fine, and a sell-out
gate is expected.\\
10 - Okay, sucker, who do you like, huh?\\
11 - I like Murphy.\\
12 - He'll murder this other guy.\\
13 - (chuckles)\\
14 - Oh, my little pigeon.\\
15 - You like Murphy, eh?\\
16 - Okay, now, let me see...\\
17 - he's, uh...
three-to-one underdog\\
18 - So I'll give you, um... even money.\\
19 - You think you're kidding\\
20 - but I'll take it.\\
21 - What you do, you find a gold mine or
something?\\
22 - Throwing your money away like that?\\
23 - Just put up or shut up, buster.\\
24 - I'll put up, I'll put up.\\
25 - How much would you like to bet, Mr.
Rockefeller?\\
26 - Make it easy on yourself.\\
27 - All right, uh...
ten dollars?\\
28 - What's the matter, you frightened?\\
29 - Fifteen dollars?\\
30 - How about $20?\\
31 - Oh, you must know something.\\
32 - I know Murphy.\\
33 - He's trained for this fight\\
34 - and he'll run through these 15 rounds\\
35 - like it was nothing.\\
36 - Okay, okay, you may have Murphy.\\
37 - I got Murphy.\\
38 - You got him, all right, don't worry.\\
39 - And may the best man win.\\
40 - SÃ­.\\
41 - (bell rings)\\
42 - Just pace yourself.\\
43 - Move away from him.\\
44 - 15 rounds to go.\\
45 - You'll murder this guy.\\
46 - Don't you worry about nothin'.\\
47 - He can't hurt you now--\\
48 - remember that.\\
49 - Just keep in there.\\
50 - Keep your chin under your shoulder.\\
51 - Throw the right, throw the right.\\
52 - Can't you hear me?\\
53 - Throw the right.\\
54 - Now!\\
55 - Well, that's the last one.\\
56 - Good.\\
57 - Honestly, I seem to have my hands\\
58 - in hot water all the time--\\
59 - baby's laundry, dishes three times a
day.\\
60 - Nope, not yet.\\
61 - "Not yet" what?\\
62 - Well, sooner or later\\
63 - I'm bound to develop webbed-foot
hands.\\
64 - (chuckling)\\
65 - Well, what will we do tonight?\\
66 - Are you kidding?\\
67 - The same thing we do every week at
this time--\\
68 - sit and watch Ricky and Fred\\
69 - watching the fights on television.\\
70 - Oh, yeah.\\
71 - Gee, Ethel, remember\\
72 - when we used to go to the movies\\
73 - on Ricky's nights off?\\
74 - "Movies"?
Yeah.\\
75 - What's that?\\
76 - Oh, you know, it's sort of like
television\\
77 - except the screen is bigger\\
78 - and it's just one channel.\\
79 - Oh... yeah.\\
80 - Hey, do you think we could talk the
guys\\
81 - out of watching tonight?\\
82 - Are you kidding?\\
83 - Tonight's the big fight.\\
84 - Every week's the big fight.\\
85 - Well, tonight's the big big fight.\\
86 - Everybody's talking about it.\\
87 - Oh, who's fighting?\\
88 - I don't know.\\
89 - It's always the same--\\
90 - Rocky somebody versus Kid
something-or-other.\\
91 - I got to go down to the corner\\
92 - and get some ginger ale.\\
93 - Well, he sure was in a hurry.\\
94 - Oh, they only allow him\\
95 - one minute between rounds.\\
96 - Yeah.\\
97 - You know, he's got himself trained\\
98 - so he can do anything in less than a
minute.\\
99 - Yeah, I know what you mean.\\
100 - Well, Ethel, what will we do tonight?\\
101 - Play cards?\\
102 - Oh, I'm sick of cards.\\
103 - Want to make some fudge?\\
104 - Oh, I'm sick of fudge.\\
105 - Well, we'll just have to sit here and
listen\\
106 - to the homey sounds of catcalls and
body blows.\\
107 - Yep.\\
108 - Say, you know, Fred's going to miss
that next round.\\
109 - Well, he didn't expect to go down to
the corner\\
110 - and get back here in time for the...\\
111 - (bell rings)\\
112 - Ethel, you know what?!\\
113 - What?\\
114 - I'm revolting.\\
115 - Oh, I wouldn't say that.\\
116 - I mean, this is a revolution.\\
117 - I am going to revolt.\\
118 - I'm tired of playing second fiddle\\
119 - to a television set.\\
120 - Ricky is my husband\\
121 - and he is going to spend the evening
talking to me or else.\\
122 - Fred, too!\\
123 - Or else what?\\
124 - Or else I am going to find\\
125 - my evening's entertainment elsewhere
without him.\\
126 - Come on.\\
127 - Okay.\\
128 - Ricky!\\
129 - Fred!\\
130 - Help!\\
131 - Fire!\\
132 - Murder!\\
133 - That's very flattering.\\
134 - Do you think they'd notice me\\
135 - if I went around and stood in front
of the set?\\
136 - (bell rings)\\
137 - Oh, boy...\\
138 - you were saved by the bell that time.\\
139 - He's only playing possum.\\
140 - Wait till the next round\\
141 - and Murphy will murder him.\\
142 - What "next round"?\\
143 - He won't be able to come out\\
144 - for the next round.\\
145 - FRED: That's only the second round.\\
146 - Just have your dough ready\\
147 - after the 15th round is over.\\
148 - I'll have my money ready...\\
149 - Fred!
Ricky!\\
150 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
151 - What is it, Ethel?\\
152 - Ethel and I have decided\\
153 - that you have married us and not a
television set.\\
154 - What do you mean?\\
155 - You know what we mean.\\
156 - We are sick and tired\\
157 - of sitting around for an hour and a
half\\
158 - looking at each other while you look
at the silly fights.\\
159 - Oh, now, honey, you know we watch the
fights\\
160 - every week at the same time.\\
161 - Yeah.\\
162 - Sorry, I'm standing right here.\\
163 - So am I.\\
164 - Girls, don't be silly.\\
165 - You know we watch the fights all the
time.\\
166 - We want to see the fights.\\
167 - I made a little bet with Rick...\\
168 - (bell rings)\\
169 - Get out!
Get out!\\
170 - FRED: Get out!
Get out!\\
171 - My goodness!\\
172 - Gee, I never heard Fred talk like
that.\\
173 - Wow! You'd think\\
174 - they were fighting that fight
themselves.\\
175 - Well, what do you think we'd better
do?\\
176 - Just forget about it?\\
177 - No, they've got to be made\\
178 - to understand how we feel about
this...\\
179 - from a safe distance, of course.\\
180 - Now you're talking sense.\\
181 - I know--\\
182 - we'll leave.\\
183 - And never come back?\\
184 - No, no, we'll go down to the corner\\
185 - and call up here.\\
186 - What?\\
187 - I'll disguise my voice and ask for me\\
188 - and then when Ricky goes to get me\\
189 - to come to the phone\\
190 - he'll find out I'm gone.\\
191 - And then they'll look for you\\
192 - and they'll find out that you're
gone.\\
193 - Then they'll really start to worry
about us.\\
194 - Yeah, let's leave a note\\
195 - and tell them to drag the river for
our bodies.\\
196 - Oh, Ethel, come on.\\
197 - Okay.\\
198 - (television blaring)\\
199 - Good night, Ricky.\\
200 - Good-bye, Fred.\\
201 - Don't wait up for us.\\
202 - We may be out quite late.\\
203 - In fact, we may never come back.\\
204 - Yeah, yeah.\\
205 - Come on, come on.\\
206 - Come on, kid.\\
207 - Kid, go, kid.\\
208 - Get away from him, Murph, get away!\\
209 - "Get away from him"?\\
210 - He'll have to leave town!\\
211 - Come on, boy, come on.\\
212 - (shouting excitedly)\\
213 - (television blaring)\\
214 - Will you look at that?\\
215 - Even the policemen.\\
216 - What a night to rob a bank.\\
217 - Yeah, go ahead and call the boys.\\
218 - Yeah.\\
219 - Have you got a dime?\\
220 - I didn't even bring my purse.\\
221 - Oh, here's one.\\
222 - (telephone ringing)\\
223 - Hello?\\
224 - (in different voice): Hello, may I
speak to Lucy, please?\\
225 - Just a minute.\\
226 - Lucy, it's for you!\\
227 - Hey, hello?\\
228 - Hello?\\
229 - (whistles)\\
230 - Hello?\\
231 - Oh...\\
232 - (in normal voice): Ethel, you know
what happened?\\
233 - Ethel...\\
234 - Ethel!\\
235 - Huh?\\
236 - You know what just happened?\\
237 - What?\\
238 - He called me to the phone\\
239 - and went back to watch the fights.\\
240 - Oh, fine, now they won't even know\\
241 - we're out of the house.\\
242 - Well, come on, let's go home.\\
243 - No.\\
244 - I refuse to go home and be ignored.\\
245 - How about going to the movies?\\
246 - They won't even miss us.\\
247 - Well, what's the difference?\\
248 - At least we'll get to go to the
movies.\\
249 - Besides, after the movies are over\\
250 - they'll miss us plenty.
That's right.\\
251 - I think I'll call Mrs. Trumbull\\
252 - and ask her to look in on little
Ricky.\\
253 - Even if he cried, you know\\
254 - they wouldn't even know the
difference.\\
255 - No.\\
256 - Oh... I haven't got a dime.\\
257 - It's a nickel.\\
258 - I'll have to get change for this.\\
259 - Uh, pardon me.\\
260 - Could I have change for this, please?\\
261 - Pardon me, mister, could I have
change for this, please?\\
262 - I'd like to make a phone call.\\
263 - We might as well be at home.\\
264 - Well, if he's so busy\\
265 - I'll make the change myself.\\
266 - (register bell rings)\\
267 - Hey, officer.\\
268 - What is it, Max?\\
269 - (round bell rings)\\
270 - Just caught this dame with her hand
in the till.\\
271 - Aha!\\
272 - Aha, nothing.\\
273 - I was just trying to make some
change.\\
274 - Oh, sure.\\
275 - That's right--\\
276 - she tried to get your attention,\\
277 - but you were busy watching
television.\\
278 - It was a lucky thing\\
279 - I dropped in here tonight\\
280 - when I came off duty.\\
281 - You must be the two babes\\
282 - who are pulling all that stick-up
stuff\\
283 - in this neighborhood.\\
284 - We are not.\\
285 - How dare you?\\
286 - We're no "stick-up babes."\\
287 - We'll see soon enough.\\
288 - What are you going to do?\\
289 - We're going to take you down\\
290 - to the station house, book you\\
291 - and fingerprint you.\\
292 - (bell rings)\\
293 - Remember, Max\\
294 - I got ten bucks on Murphy.\\
295 - Ow...\\
296 - Oh... look, a knockout!\\
297 - A knockout?!\\
298 - Who...\\
299 - Hey!\\
300 - Come back here!\\
301 - You see him?\\
302 - No.\\
303 - I think we gave him the slip\\
304 - coming up that alley.\\
305 - (groans)\\
306 - What a mess.\\
307 - Of all the things to have happen.\\
308 - For heaven's sake.\\
309 - (both sigh)\\
310 - Well, what do you think\\
311 - our dear husbands are doing?\\
312 - Care to make any bets?\\
313 - (television blaring)\\
314 - Oh, fine, we almost got arrested\\
315 - and put in jail\\
316 - and they didn't even know we were out
of the house.\\
317 - The only way we'll ever get their
attention\\
318 - is to put on trunks\\
319 - and fight each other at the Garden.\\
320 - Nah, wouldn't matter.\\
321 - Oh, don't fight it, Lucy.\\
322 - It's bigger than all four of us.\\
323 - All we can hope is that the set
breaks down.\\
324 - Hey, that's an idea.\\
325 - It is?\\
326 - Yeah.\\
327 - We could go up on the roof\\
328 - find the wire that connects with our
television set\\
329 - and...\\
330 - You mean go up there and cut the
wire?\\
331 - Yeah.\\
332 - We don't even know which wire it is.\\
333 - Oh...\\
334 - Wouldn't it be easier to fight each
other at the Garden?\\
335 - No, come on.\\
336 - TV ANNOUNCER: He throws a left and a
left and another left and still
another.\\
337 - Now he crosses with a right...\\
338 - Oh, gee, I forgot there were\\
339 - this many wires up here.\\
340 - I wonder how we'll ever find out\\
341 - which one is ours.\\
342 - It's going to be kind of hard to tell
which one's which.\\
343 - Well, guess I'll just have to cut
them all.\\
344 - No!\\
345 - I'm only kidding.\\
346 - We'll find the right one.\\
347 - My gosh, a big building like this\\
348 - sure has a lot of wires\\
349 - running around it, doesn't it?\\
350 - I'll say.\\
351 - Oh, I think it's that one right
there.\\
352 - Which one?\\
353 - That big one right over there.\\
354 - Oh, no, that's connected\\
355 - to that building across the alley.\\
356 - No, no, look where it comes from,
see?\\
357 - Look, that's it--\\
358 - that big one right there.\\
359 - No, I don't think so, Lucy.\\
360 - I think it's this little one.\\
361 - No, I think it's this big one.\\
362 - No, I think it's this little one.\\
363 - I think it's the medium- sized one.\\
364 - You do?
I don't know what...\\
365 - (screams)\\
366 - All right, you two, put up your
hands.\\
367 - Now, look, officer\\
368 - I was just going to cut this wire...\\
369 - Yeah, I know how you work.\\
370 - You cut the wire, the whole place
goes dark\\
371 - and you clean out the entire
building.\\
372 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
373 - Listen, I happen to own this
building.\\
374 - Yes, and I'm J. Edgar Hoover.\\
375 - Hold out your hands.\\
376 - I'm not taking any chances on you two
getting away this time.\\
377 - Now, look, officer, I live in this
building\\
378 - and I was just going to cut this wire\\
379 - so that our television set would go
off\\
380 - so that our husbands\\
381 - wouldn't be able to watch the fight.\\
382 - Yeah, it didn't have anything to do
with the lights.\\
383 - No.\\
384 - Your wrists, please.\\
385 - Now, look, I'll prove it.\\
386 - This is the wire I was going to cut,
isn't it?\\
387 - Yeah.\\
388 - And I'm still holding it, right?\\
389 - Right.\\
390 - Okay.\\
391 - (electricity crackles)\\
392 - Ew...\\
393 - Throw a left, will you, Murph?!\\
394 - Help!
We're being arrested!\\
395 - Help!\\
396 - (bell rings)\\
397 - Boy...\\
398 - Hey...\\
399 - did I just hear Lucy call me?\\
400 - I don't think so.\\
401 - Lucy, did you call me?\\
402 - Lucy?\\
403 - No.\\
404 - I guess not.\\
405 - How about that eighth round, huh?\\
406 - This fight will never go the
distance.\\
407 - Oh, yeah?\\
408 - Do you want to put your money\\
409 - where your mouth is?\\
410 - You're darn right.\\
411 - Come on, five bucks more?\\
412 - Okay.\\
413 - (bell rings)\\
414 - Officer, this is utterly ridiculous.\\
415 - Quiet!\\
416 - I'll do the talking.\\
417 - Well, Sarge, I finally got hold of
the two dames\\
418 - that are doing all that stick-up work
on my beat.\\
419 - Good work.\\
420 - I'd know those two faces anywhere.\\
421 - Pickpocket Pearl and Sticky Fingers
Sal.\\
422 - Really?\\
423 - What'd you get them for?\\
424 - Attempted robbery, resisting arrest\\
425 - escaping an officer\\
426 - prowling, possessing a deadly weapon\\
427 - and destruction of private property.\\
428 - (chuckles)\\
429 - You'll probably get 20 years for
this.\\
430 - And I wouldn't be surprised if you
didn't get a promotion.\\
431 - Oh, thank you, Sarge.\\
432 - Now, look, officer, I can explain.\\
433 - You see...\\
434 - I'll do the talking, Sticky Fingers.\\
435 - I'm not Sticky Fingers.\\
436 - Look, I know who you are.\\
437 - Why don't you admit it?\\
438 - Why, I've seen your faces on wanted
posters\\
439 - a hundred times.\\
440 - You have not!\\
441 - I have, too.\\
442 - I never forget a face, do I?\\
443 - Never.
Yeah.\\
444 - The only difference is\\
445 - you used to be a brunette, didn't
you?\\
446 - Dyed your hair.\\
447 - A lot you know.\\
448 - My hair is naturally red\\
449 - isn't it, Ethel?\\
450 - Look, Lucy, let's not add perjury\\
451 - to our other charges.\\
452 - Well, I might have expected\\
453 - something like that from you,
Pickpocket Pearl.\\
454 - Aha!\\
455 - Oh, "aha" yourself.\\
456 - I can clear this up in a minute.\\
457 - Will you let me use your phone?\\
458 - Don't touch it!\\
459 - I wouldn't trust it in your hands.\\
460 - What's your mouthpiece's number?\\
461 - "Mouthpiece"!\\
462 - My husband's number is Murray Hill
5-9975.\\
463 - He'll come down here\\
464 - and straighten you out in a minute.\\
465 - (whispering)\\
466 - Yeah, it's busy.\\
467 - Busy?!\\
468 - BOTH: Oh...\\
469 - The phone must still be off the hook.\\
470 - Well, now I'm going to ask you a few
questions.\\
471 - Pardon me, Sarge.\\
472 - Do you need me anymore?\\
473 - I'm off duty.\\
474 - What's your hurry?\\
475 - Well, I would like to see the end of
that fight.\\
476 - Oh, sure, go ahead.\\
477 - Thank you, Sarge.\\
478 - Wait!\\
479 - (others yell)\\
480 - What's the matter?\\
481 - Where'd everybody go?\\
482 - What are you trying to do--\\
483 - to be funny or something?\\
484 - No, no, I was just thinking.\\
485 - Officer, if you would go to my
apartment--\\
486 - that's 3-B in the building where you
arrested us--\\
487 - and tell our husbands that we're
here.\\
488 - Well...\\
489 - They're looking at the fight--\\
490 - you can see it there.\\
491 - Why not?\\
492 - Okay.\\
493 - Now, do you mind if I book you,
Sticky Fingers?\\
494 - I am not Sticky Fingers.\\
495 - Now, I'll tell you who I am.\\
496 - Have you ever heard of Ricky Ricardo?\\
497 - Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't recognize
you, Mr. Ricardo.\\
498 - I've heard you sing "Babalu" many
times.\\
499 - I am not Mr. Ricardo, I am his wife.\\
500 - Have you got any identification to
prove it?\\
501 - Identification?\\
502 - Well, I certainly didn't think\\
503 - I'd need my purse up on that roof.\\
504 - Oh, no identification, huh?\\
505 - Well, now, wait a minute, wait a
minute.\\
506 - We can identify ourselves.\\
507 - We can?\\
508 - Sure.\\
509 - Uh... uh...\\
510 - Well?\\
511 - I'd like you to meet\\
512 - my friend, Ethel Mertz.\\
513 - How do you do?\\
514 - How do you do?\\
515 - I'd like for you to meet\\
516 - my friend, Lucy Ricardo.\\
517 - How do you do?\\
518 - How do you...\\
519 - Now, wait a minute!\\
520 - That doesn't prove anything.\\
521 - Well, it proves who we are.\\
522 - Now, who are you?\\
523 - Who am I?!\\
524 - Don't you know?\\
525 - I'm Sergeant Nelson.\\
526 - How do we know that?\\
527 - Because I say so!\\
528 - Well, that isn't enough.\\
529 - Do you have any identification?\\
530 - My word is my identification!\\
531 - Well, then that's good enough for all
three of us!\\
532 - So it's settled:\\
533 - I'm Lucy Ricardo, this is Ethel Mertz\\
534 - and you're Sergeant Nelson.\\
535 - How do you do?\\
536 - How do you...\\
537 - Now, cut that out!\\
538 - Why should we believe you\\
539 - if you don't believe us?\\
540 - I'll show you why.\\
541 - I've got some posters here\\
542 - with your pictures on it.\\
543 - You have not.\\
544 - Oh, yes, I have, Sticky Fingers.\\
545 - And don't call me Sticky Fingers!\\
546 - That last round was a pip.\\
547 - Oh, boy, two more rounds.\\
548 - I don't see how either one of them\\
549 - is still standing up.\\
550 - What a fight, what a fight.\\
551 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
552 - TV ANNOUNCER: The blows that have

564 - Stay away from him.\\
565 - (shouting)\\

586 - The policeman should be there by now.\\
587 - For heaven's sake...\\

601 - Ew... hold on.\\
602 - -I'm sorry, you can go.
-Oh, we can go?\\
603 - Well, you haven't heard the last of
this.\\
604 - Jenkins, you idiot!\\
605 - Now, wait a minute, Sarge, don't get
excited.\\
606 - I can get out without them ever
knowing I've been here.\\
607 - What?\\
608 - I know it sounds crazy.\\
609 - I'll explain it to you when I get
down there.\\
610 - I'll be right over.\\
611 - Come on, come on, come on...\\
612 - Oh, what an experience!\\
613 - Oh...\\
614 - Oh, dear.\\
615 - An earthquake wouldn't drag them\\
616 - away from that set.\\
617 - Say, how much do you think that cop
told them?\\
618 - Do you think they'll be mad at us?\\
619 - Listen, if they are, our only chance\\
620 - is to be just as mad right back at
them.\\
621 - This whole thing wouldn't have
happened\\
622 - if they hadn't been so wrapped up in
their silly fight.\\
623 - That's right.\\
624 - Now, remember\\
625 - we're going to be mad at them.\\
626 - They make me sick.\\

you?\\
640 - You're a bum, Murphy!\\

whole world.\\
645 - Huh?\\
646 - What a couple of dolls.\\
647 - "Dolls"?\\
648 - Certainly, who else has such
wonderful wives?\\
649 - You knew that we wanted to watch the
fights\\
650 - so you stayed right here in the
kitchen\\

1 - (I Love Lucy theme music plays)\\
2 - RICKY: Lucy?\\
3 - Yes, dear?\\
4 - Where are you?\\
5 - Right here.\\
6 - Where'd you go?\\
7 - I'm here, I'm looking for you.\\
8 - Well, wait there, I'll come back.\\
9 - No, no.\\
10 - Stay where you are, I'll find you.\\
11 - I know this jungle better than you
do.\\
12 - Dr. Livingstone, I presume.\\
13 - What is all this?\\
14 - The laundry.\\
15 - I can't hang it outside today;\\
16 - looks like rain.\\
17 - Well, can you hang it someplace else\\
18 - besides the kitchen?\\
19 - Well, there's always the living room\\
20 - or the front hall.\\
21 - Well, I guess it is a problem.\\
22 - I'll say it is.\\
23 - It's an awful problem.\\
24 - But it's one that you could solve\\
25 - if you'd just say the word.\\
26 - What word?\\
27 - Automatic dryer.\\
28 - That's two words, and I'd like to add
one more.\\
29 - What would you like to add?\\
30 - No.\\
31 - Oh, now, Ricky, if I had a dryer\\
32 - this wouldn't happen every time it
rains.\\
33 - And there's a lot of rain ahead.\\
34 - I read about it just the other day in
the almanac.\\
35 - Look, honey, the answer is no.\\
36 - Oh...\\
37 - Dryers are too 'spensive.\\
38 - They are not "spensive."\\
39 - Not considering\\
40 - all the backbreaking work they save.\\
41 - I know, honey, I know...\\
42 - carrying this heavy basket.\\
43 - Up and down, up and down\\
44 - my muscles straining, body all aching\\
45 - and racked with pain.\\
46 - Fold those shirts, lift those sheets,
up...\\
47 - All right.\\
48 - Now, look, Old Man River, will you
dry up?\\
49 - Well...\\
50 - How about some breakfast, huh?\\
51 - I haven't fixed it yet.\\
52 - How come?\\
53 - I can't find the stove.\\
54 - I know it's around here someplace\\
55 - but I just haven't been able to find
it.\\
56 - All right, all right, all right.\\
57 - I'll eat downtown.\\
58 - How do I get out of here?\\
59 - I won't tell you.\\
60 - Ay, Dios mÃ­o.\\
61 - Esta mujer estÃ¡ completamente loca.\\
62 - No sÃ© lo que le pasa...\\
63 - Hi, Lucy.\\
64 - Hi.\\
65 - Gee, it's taken this wash\\
66 - a long time to dry.\\
67 - This is my third batch.\\
68 - Oh, you poor little thing.\\
69 - Babies sure make a lot of laundry.\\
70 - I'll say.\\
71 - I've been trying to talk Ricky\\
72 - into buying me an automatic dryer\\
73 - but he says they're too "spensive."\\
74 - I'm surprised he doesn't want me\\
75 - to go down to the river\\
76 - and beat the clothes clean on a
stone.\\
77 - Well, at least you've got\\
78 - a good washing machine.\\
79 - How'd you like to do your wash\\
80 - in that old relic of mine?\\
81 - Honestly, I think it was the first
one ever made.\\
82 - Yeah.\\
83 - Ethel, you know what?\\
84 - What?\\
85 - I want a dryer.\\
86 - I don't care how much it costs--\\
87 - we can buy it on time or something\\
88 - but I'm going to have a dryer.\\
89 - Honey, I'm home.\\
90 - Good, we can have this out right now.\\
91 - Do you mind if I come with you?\\
92 - Not at all, but why?\\
93 - I want to watch your technique.\\
94 - If it works, maybe I can use it\\
95 - to get a new washing machine out of
Fred.\\
96 - Be my guest.\\
97 - RICKY: Hi, honey.\\
98 - Hi.\\
99 - Hello, Ethel.\\
100 - Hi, Ricky.\\
101 - Ricky, I have something to say to
you.\\
102 - Well, honey, I got something to tell
you.\\
103 - Hold it, Buster, I'll do the talking
here.\\
104 - I want a new dryer, understand?\\
105 - Now, I know they're expensive\\
106 - but we can buy it on time\\
107 - and pay a little bit each week.\\
108 - Well, honey, I bought a new washer
and dryer today.\\
109 - You just don't realize what I go
through.\\
110 - Up and down those stairs 20 times a
day.\\
111 - Up and down, up and down\\
112 - down and up...\\
113 - Lucy.\\
114 - Poor little arms aching\\
115 - so that I can hardly lift them.\\
116 - Back breaking, shoulders stooped,
legs buckling...\\
117 - New washer and dryer!\\
118 - Ethel, did you hear that?\\
119 - Yep, five minutes ago.\\
120 - Oh, honey, you're wonderful.\\
121 - Well, I got to thinking\\
122 - that it is pretty rough on you\\
123 - and I got a good deal.\\
124 - Oh, honey, you're so thoughtful.\\
125 - I love you.\\
126 - Aren't they sweet?\\
127 - ETHEL: Just like two lovebirds.\\
128 - What are you, a bird watcher?\\
129 - Fred, guess what?\\
130 - Ricky's buying me\\
131 - a new automatic washer and dryer.\\
132 - No kidding?\\
133 - Yeah!\\
134 - Well, it isn't as much as it sounds.\\
135 - I got them wholesale\\
136 - and the fellow's allowing me $35\\
137 - on our old washing machine.\\
138 - Hey, wait a minute.\\
139 - How'd you like to have a new washing
machine?\\
140 - Oh, Fred, do you really mean it?\\
141 - Sure, I'll buy you the Ricardos' old
one.\\
142 - Old one?\\
143 - You just said a new one.\\
144 - Well, it'll be new to you.\\
145 - Oh, fine.\\
146 - All I ever get is hand-me-downs.\\
147 - All right, if you don't want it, you
don't...\\
148 - Oh, no, no, I'll take it.\\
149 - We can give our old one\\
150 - to the Smithsonian Institute.\\
151 - Well, now, just a minute.\\
152 - I-I-I don't think\\
153 - this whole thing is any good.\\
154 - Why not?\\
155 - Well, my father told me many years
ago:\\
156 - "Nunca hagas negocios\\
157 - con amigos ni con parientes."\\
158 - (gasps)\\
159 - Your father said that?\\
160 - Never mind.\\
161 - It was good advice.\\
162 - Well, will somebody please tell us
what it means?\\
163 - It means, "Never do business\\
164 - with friends or relatives."\\
165 - Oh, honey, that's just silly.\\
166 - It isn't silly.\\
167 - Listen, people act in a very strange
way\\
168 - when they're dealing with money.\\
169 - Arguments about a business deal\\
170 - could mean the end of our friendship.\\
171 - Oh, you certainly don't think much of
our friendship.\\
172 - Well, I do, too--\\
173 - that's why I don't think it's a good
idea.\\
174 - Now, you let me sell it to the dealer\\
175 - and have him sell it to you.\\
176 - Oh, that's fine.\\
177 - You'll sell it to him for $35\\
178 - and he'll charge me $75.\\
179 - Yeah, Ricky, if you sell it to us\\
180 - you'll be saving us $40.\\
181 - Yeah, the dealer might even charge
them $100\\
182 - and then you'd be saving them, uh...
$65.\\
183 - FRED: Yeah.\\
184 - And the dealer might even charge them
$125\\
185 - and then you'd be...\\
186 - All right, all right.\\
187 - Saving them probably...\\
188 - All right, I get it, all right, all
right.\\
189 - As much as a hundred...\\
190 - Ricky, you'll be doing me a favor.\\
191 - I'll never get a new washing machine\\
192 - out of Secondhand Louie here.\\
193 - Well, now, look.\\
194 - Suppose that something goes wrong?\\
195 - Oh, honey, what could go wrong?\\
196 - We've had that machine for four years\\
197 - and nothing's ever gone wrong.\\
198 - What if some little thing does go
wrong?\\
199 - I'm handy with tools, I could fix it.\\
200 - LUCY: Sure.\\
201 - Oh, it can't affect our friendship.\\
202 - Of course not.\\
203 - Ethel, Fred...\\
204 - you may have the machine.\\
205 - For $35.\\
206 - Oh, thanks, Ricky.\\
207 - That's fine.\\
208 - Great, I'll go and make out the
check.\\
209 - Oh, wait, wait, Fred.\\
210 - Now, there's no hurry.\\
211 - Okay.\\
212 - Let's move the machine right now\\
213 - over to our apartment, huh?\\
214 - Are you finished with it, Lucy?\\
215 - They're delivering\\
216 - the new one in the morning.\\
217 - Okay!\\
218 - Come on, let's go and get it.\\
219 - I'll help you, Fred.\\
220 - Now, Ricky, Ricky, be careful, don't
scratch it.\\
221 - It might ruin our friendship.\\
222 - All right....\\
223 - (singing off-key): All through the
summer\\
224 - Plants blooming all alone\\
225 - La-di-da-di-di-di-di-di\\

229 - Da-da-da-di\\
230 - La-di-da-da...\\
231 - (trails off)\\
232 - Oh, it's you.\\
233 - I thought there was something wrong
with the washing machine.\\
234 - Oh.\\
235 - How about some lunch?\\
236 - I'm fixing you a sandwich.\\
237 - Good, I'm hungry.\\
238 - Good.\\
239 - La-di-di-da...\\
240 - Hi.\\
241 - Oh, hi, honey.
Oh, hi, Luce.\\
242 - Come on in.
Come on.\\
243 - Oh, have you got the little doll with
you?\\
244 - FRED: Yeah.\\
245 - Oh, hello, honey.\\
246 - LUCY: Say "hi."\\
247 - Look at that little champion.\\
248 - Get the dukes up, Champ.\\
249 - Look out, now, Fred.\\
250 - He's stronger than you are, you know.\\
251 - I just came up to see\\
252 - how my washing machine was doing.\\
253 - You mean my washing machine.\\
254 - Oh, that's right, I forgot.\\
255 - Oh, Lucy, it's just wonderful.\\
256 - It washes everything so fast\\
257 - I've run out of things to wash.\\
258 - Really?\\
259 - As a matter of fact\\
260 - I was just getting ready to ask Fred\\
261 - to go out someplace and get dirty.\\
262 - (laughing)\\
263 - Oh, hi.\\
264 - Hi, Rick.\\
265 - I thought I'd find you here.\\
266 - Hi, honey.\\
267 - I didn't expect you home so soon.\\
268 - I'll go get your lunch, dear.\\
269 - Oh, no, stay and eat with us.\\
270 - Yeah.\\
271 - Oh, no.\\
272 - Oh, I got cold cuts and everything.\\
273 - You sure you got enough?\\
274 - Anybody from Albuquerque\\
275 - has always had enough to eat.\\
276 - Oh, we've got everything.\\
277 - Well, I love it.\\
278 - FRED: Bologna, salami...\\
279 - Put the baby right there.\\
280 - Oh, just put everything in there.\\
281 - Sit down here.\\
282 - Oh, I love it.\\
283 - What kind of meat, Ricky?\\
284 - (all speaking over each other)\\
285 - (washing machine rattles)\\
286 - (conversation continuing)\\
287 - I wonder what that is.\\
288 - Yeah, honey...\\
289 - I always forget to get the butter.\\
290 - (loud banging)\\
291 - Hey, it's the washer!\\
292 - What's the matter with this thing?\\
293 - What's the matter with it, Fred?\\
294 - I don't know!\\
295 - (all shouting)\\
296 - RICKY: Pull the plug out!\\
297 - The plug!\\
298 - Pull the plug out, Fred!\\
299 - Pull the plug!\\
300 - Oh!\\
301 - (all shouting)\\
302 - Oh!\\
303 - Oh, dear.\\
304 - Gee, honey, this never happened
before, did it?\\
305 - Never, never.\\
306 - Gee, Fred, that's too bad.\\
307 - Yeah, this is really a mess.\\
308 - It's a good thing we found out in
time.\\
309 - I'll say.\\
310 - Yeah.\\
311 - Found out in time for what?\\
312 - I mean before the deal went through.\\
313 - What do you mean, "before the deal
went through"?\\
314 - Yeah.\\
315 - Well, I hope you don't think\\
316 - we're buying this piece of junk.\\
317 - You already bought it!\\
318 - I did not.\\
319 - No money changed hands.\\
320 - You took possession of the
merchandise.\\
321 - That's the same thing!\\
322 - Yeah!\\
323 - I told you we shouldn't have sold it
to them.\\
324 - You didn't.\\
325 - Not much, I did.\\
326 - You're going to pay me\\
327 - for this washing machine!\\
328 - He is not.\\
329 - He is too.\\
330 - He is not.\\
331 - He is too!\\
332 - He is not!\\
333 - I mean, I am not!\\
334 - You're not going\\
335 - to unload this lemon on us.\\
336 - Lemon?\\
337 - Mira que tiene el coraje de decirle a
uno ahora\\
338 - que no quieren comprar la mÃ¡quina de
lavar.\\
339 - Yeah.\\
340 - Oh...\\
341 - I can see it all now.\\
342 - They knew this was a bum machine.\\
343 - They knew it didn't have any trade-in
value\\
344 - so they cagily planned to palm it off
on us.\\
345 - Palm it off!\\
346 - You begged us to let you have it.\\
347 - Begged!\\
348 - Yeah, begged!\\
349 - He says, "I'm a very handy man with
tools.\\
350 - If anything go wrong, I can fix it."\\
351 - Entonces Ud. SeÃ±ora dijo: "A mÃ­ no
me importa nada."\\
352 - "It won't harm our friendship a
little bit."\\
353 - No... yeah-- some friendship!\\
354 - That was before we knew you were
cheating us.\\
355 - Cheating!?
Cheating!?\\
356 - There's been no cheating\\
357 - but there's been plenty of welching.\\
358 - Welching?!
Welching?!\\
359 - I'll thank you to haul\\
360 - this hunk of junk out of our kitchen!\\
361 - It is immaterial to me, Mr. Mertz\\
362 - what you do with your old appliances\\
363 - after you ruin them.\\
364 - Well said.\\
365 - Thank you.\\
366 - Come on, Lucy.\\
367 - RICKY: And I shall expect the check\\
368 - in the mailbox in the morning\\
369 - or I'll see my lawyer.\\
370 - Oh, yeah?\\
371 - BOTH: Yeah!\\
372 - (glass shattering)\\
373 - Oh, no, you don't, Mrs. Mertz.\\
374 - You put that machine\\
375 - in front of your own door.\\
376 - I'd be very happy to, Mrs. Ricardo\\
377 - only that this happens to be your
washing machine.\\
378 - Oh, no.\\
379 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
380 - (straining): Put it right over there
where it belongs.\\
381 - Oh!\\
382 - MRS. TRUMBULL: Mrs. Ricardo!\\
383 - Yoo-hoo, Mrs. Ricardo!\\
384 - Mrs. Ricardo!\\
385 - I'm out here!\\
386 - Oh, my, your front door was open,
Mrs. Ricardo.\\
387 - Well...\\
388 - Good morning, Mrs. Mertz.\\
389 - (straining): Good morning.\\
390 - What are you doing?\\
391 - We're moving Mrs. Mertz's washing
machine\\
392 - in front of her door.\\
393 - (panting): No... we're moving\\
394 - Mrs. Ricardo's washing machine\\
395 - in front of her door.\\
396 - Well, if you don't mind my saying so\\
397 - you're doing it the hard way.\\
398 - What's the matter?\\
399 - You seem to be angry\\
400 - with each other.\\
401 - I'll tell you what's the matter.\\
402 - Truce?\\
403 - Truce.\\
404 - I'll tell you exactly what happened.\\
405 - Ricky bought me a new washing
machine.\\
406 - And the Mertzes insisted on buying
our old one\\
407 - and then they got it over into their
place.\\
408 - They ruined it and they refuse to pay
for it.\\
409 - Oh, that isn't the way it happened at
all.\\
410 - As a favor to them, we allowed
ourselves\\
411 - to be talked into buying this piece
of junk\\
412 - and when we got it home, it fell
apart.\\
413 - What do you mean, it fell apart?\\
414 - What do you mean, we talked you into
it?\\
415 - Oh, that's...\\
416 - You practically begged.\\
417 - (shouting over each other)\\
418 - Now, now, now, now!\\
419 - Ladies, calm down.\\
420 - You begged!\\
421 - That's what you did, you begged!\\
422 - You begged us to.\\
423 - That's what you did, you begged!\\
424 - Why, Mrs. Ricardo\\
425 - your temper is as hot as your red
hair.\\
426 - What about hers?\\
427 - Oh, mine's as cold as your dark
roots.\\
428 - Well!\\
429 - Well, now...\\
430 - Now, now, listen, let's see a minute.\\
431 - There ought to be some way\\
432 - to settle this in a friendly manner.\\
433 - There... there is.\\
434 - They can pay us our friendly $35.\\
435 - What?\\
436 - Well, now, now wait just a minute.\\
437 - I'll tell you.\\
438 - I have a nephew\\
439 - who works in an appliance business.\\
440 - I'll ask him to look at it.\\
441 - Maybe he can fix it.\\
442 - How about that?\\
443 - Don't ask me, it isn't my machine.\\
444 - She can do anything she wants to with
her washing machine.\\
445 - It is none of my business.\\
446 - (door slams)\\
447 - Oh, she makes me so darn mad.\\
448 - Oh, you two.\\
449 - Well, I just came up to tell you\\
450 - that I'll be able to baby-sit\\
451 - with little Ricky this afternoon.\\
452 - Oh, well, thank you, Mrs. Trumbull.\\
453 - I'm very happy that you can, because
I...\\
454 - How is it, Joe?\\
455 - Anything serious?\\
456 - Oh, I think we can pull her through,
Aunt Matilda.\\
457 - Oh.\\
458 - But I think somebody's confused.\\
459 - This is a washing machine.\\
460 - They've been trying to use it\\
461 - as a garbage disposal.\\
462 - Well... that's strange.\\
463 - How much will it cost to fix it?\\
464 - Oh, seeing it's your friends\\
465 - about a dollar and a half.\\
466 - Say, they wouldn't want to sell this,
would they?\\
467 - I don't know.\\
468 - I'll give them 50 bucks for it.\\
469 - Well, I'll tell them\\
470 - and let you know what they say.\\
471 - I... I better go look after the baby
now.\\
472 - So long, Joe.\\
473 - Good-bye, Aunt Matilda.\\
474 - Oh, are you the man fixing the
machine?\\
475 - Yeah, that's right.\\
476 - It's a wreck, isn't it?\\
477 - No, it's in pretty good shape.\\
478 - It can be fixed up.\\
479 - Oh, yeah?\\
480 - Say, you don't know if they'd like to
sell that machine, do you?\\
481 - Sell it?\\
482 - Yeah, whoever owns it, I'll give them
50 bucks for it.\\
483 - Uh... uh...
it, um... it, uh...\\
484 - It belongs to my husband and me\\
485 - but I don't know\\
486 - whether he'd want to sell it so
cheap.\\
487 - Have you spoken to the Ricardos?\\
488 - Ricardos-- who are they?\\
489 - You don... oh...\\
490 - Never mind, I'll call you.\\
491 - Have you got a card?\\
492 - Oh.\\
493 - There you are.\\
494 - Oh, thanks, well, I'll let you know\\
495 - if my husband decides to sell it.\\
496 - It's such a good machine.\\
497 - Yeah.\\
498 - Okay, good-bye.\\
499 - Good-bye.\\
500 - (door closes)\\
501 - Fred! Fred!\\
502 - Hi, Mrs. Trumbull.\\
503 - Well, hello, Mrs. Trumbull.\\
504 - How'd little Ricky behave?\\
505 - Like an angel.\\
506 - I gave him his bottle\\
507 - and he went right back to sleep.\\
508 - That's good.\\
509 - I wanted to talk to you\\
510 - about your washing machine.\\
511 - Oh, you mean the Mertzes' washing
machine.\\
512 - Well, whoever it belongs to...\\
513 - It belongs to the Mertzes.\\
514 - Yes, that's right.\\
515 - Well, my nephew says he'll pay $50
for it.\\
516 - He'll pay $50 for our washing
machine?\\
517 - That's what he said.\\
518 - Well, uh... did...\\
519 - did you speak to Ethel about it,
uh...?\\
520 - No, no, I haven't told her yet.\\
521 - Well... well, don't bother, dear.\\
522 - I'll... tell her for you.\\
523 - Thank you so much.\\
524 - It's all right.\\
525 - Let me know if they decide to sell
it.\\
526 - Oh, yes, yes, I will.\\
527 - Thanks very much for coming down.\\
528 - I hope little Ricky wasn't too much
trouble.\\
529 - Wasn't any trouble at all.\\
530 - Thank you, Mrs. Trumbull.\\
531 - Good-bye.\\
532 - Good-bye.\\
533 - Ricky!\\
534 - (laughing)\\
535 - Oh, my gosh!\\
536 - I'm glad the Mertzes didn't buy it
now.\\
537 - (laughing): This is perfect.\\
538 - We will go tell them\\
539 - that we will relieve them of their
obligation.\\
540 - (door buzzer sounds)\\
541 - Isn't this wonderful?\\
542 - I can't believe it.\\
543 - (sweetly): Hi.\\
544 - RICKY: Well.\\
545 - Lucy.\\
546 - Ethel.\\
547 - RICKY: Hiya, Fred.\\
548 - Nice to see you.\\
549 - Come on in, sit down.\\
550 - Oh, no, you sit down.\\
551 - No, you sit down, Fred.\\
552 - I'd rather...\\
553 - No, I want you to be comfortable.\\
554 - Sit down, Fred.\\
555 - Thank you.\\
556 - My, but it's good to see you.\\
557 - Oh, it's good to see you, too.\\
558 - You know, we've been talking over\\
559 - this silly washing machine situation.\\
560 - Oh, so have we.\\
561 - Isn't that a coincidence?\\
562 - (forcing a laugh)\\
563 - Well, we did act pretty terrible.\\
564 - Yeah, we're ashamed of ourselves\\
565 - and we want to apologize.\\
566 - Oh, it's not...\\
567 - Ricky, here's your check.\\
568 - Well, now...
look here, old man\\
569 - you really don't...\\
570 - No, no, no, we couldn't take your
check.\\
571 - Well, why not?\\
572 - Why, we just wouldn't expect you\\
573 - to pay for a washing machine\\
574 - that wasn't any good.\\
575 - Oh, nonsense.\\
576 - I'm a man of my word\\
577 - and a deal's a deal.\\
578 - Here, Ricky.\\
579 - No, no, no, no.\\
580 - No, sir, no, no, no.\\
581 - Not when I tried to palm off some
faulty merchandise on you.\\
582 - No, I couldn't.\\
583 - No, we wouldn't let you pay for it.\\
584 - To tell you the truth, we knew it
would break down.\\
585 - Why, we're practically swindlers.\\
586 - That's right, yeah.\\
587 - Oh, no.\\
588 - We tried to welch on a perfectly
legitimate deal.\\
589 - Give him the money, Fred.\\
590 - Yes, sir.\\
591 - You've got to take the check.\\
592 - Come on, now, Ricky\\
593 - you've got to take the money...\\
594 - There you are.\\
595 - Oh, no, you don't, Ricky.\\
596 - No, no.\\
597 - No, no.\\
598 - Now, Ethel, you just take this check.\\
599 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
600 - No, no...\\
601 - Now, look, Fred, I don't want it.\\
602 - Oh!\\
603 - Come on, Ethel\\
604 - let's get our washing machine!\\
605 - Okay.\\
606 - Now, there's your check.\\
607 - Now, look, Fred, I don't want it!\\
608 - Fred, I won't sell it to you!\\
609 - Hurry up.\\
610 - Fred... Fred!\\
611 - Ricky, let go of our washing machine.\\
612 - Oh, no.\\
613 - Let go of it!\\
614 - Fred, I won't want you to get stuck
with it.\\
615 - I want to get stuck!\\
616 - You don't want it.\\
617 - Lucy, would you kindly take your
hands\\
618 - off of my washing machine?\\
619 - Why should I take my hands off your
washing machine\\
620 - when it belongs to us?\\
621 - (all shouting, arguing)\\
622 - (loud crash)\\
623 - Look what happened to your washing
machine.\\
624 - Our washing machine?\\
625 - Certainly.\\
626 - You said it was your washing machine.\\
627 - You said you were ashamed...\\
628 - (all shouting over each other)\\
629 - Pardon me, I was up here this
afternoon\\
630 - looking at a washing machine.\\
631 - I offered 50 bucks for it.\\
632 - I spoke to you.\\
633 - Yeah, I know.\\
634 - Well, I got a buyer for it.\\
635 - He'll go as high as $75.\\
636 - Seventy-five...?\\
637 - Oh, no...!\\
638 - (laughing)\\
639 - They'd pay seventy...\\
640 - For that thing!\\
641 - Oh, no, I don't believe it.\\
642 - What's the matter...\\
643 - What's the matter with you people?\\
644 - Are you all nuts or something?\\
645 - (all four continue laughing)\\
646 - Oh, my.\\
647 - I'll tell you what I'll do, Fred.\\
648 - I'll split the cost of the rail with
you.\\
649 - Okay, and I'll give you $17.50\\
650 - for half of that washing machine.\\
651 - Oh, that's a good idea.\\
652 - Here's your check.\\
653 - You see, I knew\\
654 - nothing could ever affect our
friendship.\\
