1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - ANNOUNCER: And now, "I Love Lucy."\\
3 - (audience applauding as orchestra
plays theme song)\\
4 - Oh, Lucy, this party's a wonderful
idea.\\
5 - I think so.\\
6 - I still can't think why we're having
this party for Ricky.\\
7 - Oh, it's just something you do in
Hollywood, Fred.\\
8 - When a person finishes a picture,\\
9 - you give a party for him.\\
10 - Oh.\\
11 - Oh, gee, Ethel, those hors d'oeuvres
you bought\\
12 - are just scrumptious.\\
13 - Thanks.\\
14 - But caviar-- you shouldn't have done
that.\\
15 - Oh, why not? Well, enjoy it.\\
16 - After all, how many Hollywood stars
do we know?\\
17 - (hammering)
But caviar, five dollars a jar.\\
18 - Ow!\\
19 - Five bucks for a jar of fish eggs?!\\
20 - FRED: Oh, now, Fred!\\
21 - ETHEL: Don't make anything out of it.\\
22 - Five bucks is five bucks.
Well, it's for a party.\\
23 - We'll talk about it later.\\
24 - Look.\\
25 - (gasps)\\
26 - What a beautiful cake!\\
27 - Isn't it dreamy?
Oh, Lucy!\\
28 - Yeah, it's great.\\
29 - "To my darlin', another Marlon."\\
30 - Marlon?\\
31 - Marlon Brando.\\
32 - Do you know anybody else named
Marlon?\\
33 - Sure. Monroe.\\
34 - Marlon Monroe!\\
35 - Oh, Fred.\\
36 - I'm going to get the baby.\\
37 - I promised him he could come to the
party.\\
38 - I wouldn't want to disappoint the
little doll.\\
39 - Oh, boy.\\
40 - Oh, oh, oh, oh, now, Fred, no sneak
previews.\\
41 - Well, you'd think I could have one
bite.\\
42 - ETHEL: Hi, honey.\\
43 - Oh, hi, son.\\
44 - He's so sleepy.
Oh, hello, honey.\\
45 - Here he comes.\\
46 - Hide the cake.
Hide the cake.\\
47 - LUCY, FRED AND ETHEL: Happy party to
you\\
48 - Happy party to you\\
49 - Happy end of the picture, dear Ricky\\
50 - Happy party to you\\
51 - I bought the caviar.\\
52 - Aren't you nice!\\
53 - Thank you.
Thank you.\\
54 - Say, happy party, papa.\\
55 - Hiya, there, partner.\\
56 - He's so sleepy.\\
57 - Hi, my son.\\
58 - Show him the cake, honey.
Show him the cake.\\
59 - Oh, look at that beautiful cake!\\
60 - "To my darlin', another Marlon."\\
61 - (chuckling)\\
62 - Well, I guess Brando and I do have a
lot in common.\\
63 - Yeah, I can't understand either of
you when you talk.\\
64 - Well, he's got to go back to bed,
honey.\\
65 - You can have your cake in the
morning.\\
66 - Say good night.
All right, son.\\
67 - I'll save you a nice, big piece.\\
68 - Aw, he wants to say beddy-bye.\\
69 - I'll take him.
You take him, honey.\\
70 - We'll give you a piece of cake\\
71 - in the morning, sweetie.\\
72 - Honey, we'll give you a piece of cake
in the morning.\\
73 - It's so late. I thought I was gonna
finish early.\\
74 - Well, I shouldn't have brought him
out, but I...\\
75 - I'll be right in, son.\\
76 - I'm sorry, honey.\\
77 - Well, how did the picture go, dear?\\
78 - Well, everybody seems to think\\
79 - it's going to be a hit-- a big hit.\\
80 - Wonderful.\\
81 - Well, here is to Hollywood.\\
82 - Oh, wait for me.
Wait a minute.\\
83 - Wait for Ethel.
Wait for Ethel.\\
84 - Here, hon.\\
85 - Here were are.\\
86 - Here is to Hollywood.\\
87 - ALL: Here's to Hollywood.\\
88 - It's been fun, but it'll be nice to
get back home.\\
89 - Home?
Home?\\
90 - Sure. I'm finished with the picture.\\
91 - There's nothing to keep us here now.\\
92 - Well, I know, bu-but we can't leave
Hollywood yet.\\
93 - Why not?\\
94 - Because there are a million things we
haven't seen.\\
95 - The Coconut Grove.\\
96 - Olvera Street.\\
97 - Ava Gardner.\\
98 - The Hollywood Bowl.\\
99 - Catalina Island.\\
100 - Ava Gardner.\\
101 - We heard you the first time.\\
102 - Oh, we haven't seen the footprints\\
103 - at Grauman's Chinese Theater.\\
104 - Well, I'm sorry, honey, but I got to
go back to work.\\
105 - I got to go back to work at the
Tropicana.\\
106 - You know, the studio's not paying for
this anymore. I am.\\
107 - Oh, all right, warden.\\
108 - When do we leave?\\
109 - Well, just as soon as you can get
ready.\\
110 - How long will it take you?\\
111 - Six years.\\
112 - Lucy...\\
113 - Well, if you're going to bargain,\\
114 - I want to start high.\\
115 - Come on, Lucy.\\
116 - Four years.\\
117 - Come on!\\
118 - Oh, it isn't fair, Ricky.\\
119 - We haven't seen anything\\
120 - and we have no souvenirs to take
home...\\
121 - No souvenirs?\\
122 - Well, hardly any.\\
123 - What do you call this?\\
124 - You got a whole box full of junk.\\
125 - Junk?!\\
126 - Do you call an orange\\
127 - autographed by Robert Taylor junk?\\
128 - Look at this old, dried-up thing.\\
129 - You can't even read his name.\\
130 - The letters are all shriveled
together.\\
131 - Oh, they are not.\\
132 - It's very clear. It says...\\
133 - (muffled): "Robert Taylor."\\
134 - How about this-- this old, tired
grapefruit?\\
135 - That says, "Richard Widmark."\\
136 - It does?\\
137 - Well, it did when it was young. Right
there,\\
138 - in that deep crevice.\\
139 - Sure, it says, uh,\\
140 - (muffled): "Richard... Richard
Widmark."\\
141 - Robert Taylor and Richard Widmark.\\
142 - Look at this-- an old tin can.\\
143 - Just a minute.\\
144 - That is not an ordinary old tin can.\\
145 - This just happens to be an old tin
can\\
146 - that was squashed by Cary Grant's
left rear wheel.\\
147 - Oh, well, that's different.\\
148 - Yeah, well.\\
149 - What's this?\\
150 - "Lana Turner's Lipstick Print."\\
151 - Which one of you morons is saving
this?\\
152 - I am!\\
153 - Give it here before you smear it.\\
154 - Menus from the Brown Derby.\\
155 - Yes.\\
156 - Match covers from Ciro's.\\
157 - An ashtray from the Beverly Hilton.\\
158 - So?\\
159 - Chopsticks from the Beachcomber.\\
160 - You got enough stuff here. Don't
worry.\\
161 - We have not, Ricky.\\
162 - We just haven't been anyplace.\\
163 - Now, you just got to give us more
time.\\
164 - FRED: Come on, Rick.\\
165 - We really wanted to see where you
were making the picture.\\
166 - You said that you would go with us
after you finished.\\
167 - All right.
All right.\\
168 - I'll tell you what.\\
169 - We'll stay one more week.\\
170 - Good!
Great!\\
171 - That's all.
One more week.\\
172 - That's enough.
Now, we'll start\\
173 - the first thing in the morning.\\
174 - What'll we see first?\\
175 - I vote for Catalina.\\
176 - I vote for Catalina.\\
177 - I vote for Grauman's Chinese.\\
178 - We got the majority.\\
179 - I got the car.\\
180 - Grauman's Chinese.
Grauman's Chinese.\\
181 - Oh, hurry up, Fred.\\
182 - You've been focusing that thing for
30 minutes.\\
183 - We haven't got all day.\\
184 - All right. All right.\\
185 - I'm ready now.\\
186 - Come on, look at me, Ethel.\\
187 - Come on, look at me and smile, Ethel.\\
188 - Make up your mind.\\
189 - I can't do both.\\
190 - Watch for the little birdie, now.\\
191 - One... two...\\
192 - ETHEL: Fred!\\
193 - Three!\\
194 - There. I got a good one.\\
195 - Don't forget to turn it up to the
next picture.\\
196 - Oh, look, Ethel.\\
197 - Gloria Swanson's footprints.\\
198 - Oh, doesn't she have tiny little
feet?\\
199 - I'll say, about size one-and-a-half,
I would say.\\
200 - Oh, Harold Lloyd!\\
201 - Harold Lloyd's footprint.\\
202 - Oh, look.
His glasses.\\
203 - Isn't that cute?\\
204 - How do you suppose they ever did
that?\\
205 - Oh, Lucy, Tyrone Power.\\
206 - (swooning)\\
207 - What are you doing?\\
208 - Comparing my leg to Betty Grable's.\\
209 - Oh, it looks identical.\\
210 - Oh, what, to you and me, maybe,\\
211 - but I doubt if it would fool Harry
James.\\
212 - Oh, look.
Joan Crawford's footprint.\\
213 - Oh, my feet are smaller than Joan
Crawford's.\\
214 - Let me try.\\
215 - Mine aren't.\\
216 - Hey! Look, my feet are smaller than
Gary cooper's.\\
217 - No kidding?\\
218 - Yeah. Look.\\
219 - Mine aren't.\\
220 - Oh, here's one for you to try,
Ethel-- Trigger!\\
221 - Oh, Ethel, look!\\
222 - Oh! John Wayne!\\
223 - Oh, boy, just his footprints give me
goose bumps.\\
224 - We got to go see his new picture,
Blood Alley.\\
225 - I hear it is just wonderful.\\
226 - I heard it was so exciting.\\
227 - Oh, he plays the part of a daring
adventurer\\
228 - and his block is loose.\\
229 - John Wayne's block is loose.\\
230 - It is?\\
231 - Yeah.\\
232 - Ethel?\\
233 - What?\\
234 - I've got an idea.\\
235 - I don't like that look on your face.\\
236 - I'm going to take home\\
237 - a souvenir to end all souvenirs--\\
238 - John Wayne's block.\\
239 - Well, you'll need it,\\
240 - 'cause when Ricky finds out what
you've done,\\
241 - he'll knock yours off.\\
242 - Now, let's see how we will go about
it.\\
243 - We?!\\
244 - Oh, ho. Count me out.\\
245 - I wouldn't touch that with a ten-foot
pole.\\
246 - Oh, now... now, listen here, Ethel.\\
247 - How would you like to be\\
248 - the only woman in New York City\\
249 - with a friend who has John Wayne's
footprints\\
250 - under her bed?\\
251 - Not interested.\\
252 - Well, then, how would you like to be
the only woman\\
253 - in New York City who has John Wayne's
footprints\\
254 - under her own bed?\\
255 - Every other week.\\
256 - Oh...\\
257 - Okay.\\
258 - Okay.\\
259 - Now, let's see...\\
260 - Oh, Lucy, how are we gonna\\
261 - steal a big cement block\\
262 - like that without being seen?\\
263 - It's a cinch.\\
264 - We'll come here late at night when
nobody else is around.\\
265 - We'll bring a crowbar and we'll pry
it up.\\
266 - Okay.\\
267 - Now, we'll...\\
268 - Ooh, wait just a second.\\
269 - What'll you do about the space it'll
leave?\\
270 - We'll bring some quick-drying cement,\\
271 - fill it in, it'll be dry by morning.\\
272 - Lucy, you're a natural-born crook.\\
273 - Thank you, ma'am.\\
274 - Now, we'll need cement, a bucket,\\
275 - a trawl, a crowbar\\
276 - and a car to make a quick getaway.\\
277 - Now, is there anything else we'll
need?\\
278 - Yeah. A good lawyer.\\
279 - Fred!\\
280 - Yes, "Fred!" I heard the whole thing.\\
281 - You two dames have had some pretty
nutty schemes\\
282 - in your time, but this one is regular
Bellevue bait.\\
283 - Oh, come on, Fred.
Help us, huh?\\
284 - I will not, and you're not gonna do
it either.\\
285 - Oh, come on, please, Fred.\\
286 - Ethel, Ethel, Ethel, never mind.\\
287 - It's a real crazy idea.\\
288 - Fred's right. Just forget it.\\
289 - I'll go and get the car.\\
290 - I'd better put you two squirrels back
in your cage.\\
291 - Lucy, what's happened to you?\\
292 - I never saw you give up so easy.\\
293 - Who's giving up? I just want to throw
him off the scent\\
294 - so he doesn't go blabbing to Ricky.\\
295 - Oh, sorry, Chief.\\
296 - Now, here's what we're gonna do and
this is the way....\\
297 - There's nobody around.\\
298 - Good.\\
299 - I thought Ricky would never go to
sleep.\\
300 - Oh, Fred was a little restless, too.\\
301 - He didn't start to snore till his
head hit the pillow.\\
302 - Oh, Lucy, I'm scared.\\
303 - What if somebody sees us?\\
304 - (sighing)\\
305 - Listen, Ethel, if you're gonna get
chicken\\
306 - on a routine souvenir hunt...\\
307 - Routine?!\\
308 - Come on.\\
309 - Okay.\\
310 - Oh, say, we'd better hurry.\\
311 - This cement's getting hard.\\
312 - Really?\\
313 - Maybe I'd better hide this bucket\\
314 - till we need Okay.	     it, huh?\\
315 - All right. I'll put it over here.\\
316 - All right.	    Oh!\\
317 - This is moving it.
Okay.\\
318 - I got it!\\
319 - I got it.\\
320 - What'll I do?\\
321 - Now, wait... wait till I lift it up a
little bit,\\
322 - and then put your fingers right...\\
323 - Now wait.\\
324 - Oh, be careful!\\
325 - Now get a good, firm grip on it.\\
326 - It's heavier than I thought.\\
327 - All right, there.\\
328 - You got it?
I got it.\\
329 - Ooh! That's....!\\
330 - Ooh!
All right. I got it.\\
331 - Ready?\\
332 - Firm grip.\\
333 - You ready?\\
334 - Somebody's coming!\\
335 - Don't panic.\\
336 - Maybe they'll walk right by.\\
337 - Oh, they're coming closer.\\
338 - (groaning)\\
339 - Ooh, I'm sorry!\\
340 - Hurry up. Here, wait a minute.\\
341 - Can you stand it?\\
342 - (groaning)\\
343 - Can you stand it, honey?\\
344 - MAN: Oh, there they are, honey.\\
345 - I came down here this afternoon\\
346 - and measured them.\\
347 - I'm bigger than any of these he-men.\\
348 - Really?\\
349 - Yeah, look.\\
350 - Gary cooper.\\
351 - Oh, darling!\\
352 - You're wonderful!\\
353 - I'm bigger than John Wayne, too!\\
354 - You are?\\
355 - Yeah. Come on, I'll show you.\\
356 - Oh...\\
357 - (chuckling)\\
358 - Good evening.\\
359 - Good evening.\\
360 - It was around here someplace.\\
361 - Pardon me.\\
362 - Are you sitting on John Wayne?\\
363 - Who, me? No!\\
364 - Are you sure?\\
365 - Positive. She's sitting on Bill
Holden.\\
366 - She's President of the Bill Holden
Fan Club,\\
367 - and once a year she comes here to sit
on his signature.\\
368 - Very funny.
I could have sworn...\\
369 - Come on, honey.\\
370 - Let's get out of here.\\
371 - Oh, Lucy!\\
372 - Oh, you poor little thing!\\
373 - You ought to try sitting on a
crowbar.\\
374 - Oh!\\
375 - What do I do?\\
376 - Just lift it up so I can get my hand
out.\\
377 - One hand.\\
378 - Oh...\\
379 - Are you all right?\\
380 - Just what I needed-- two Chinese back
scratchers.\\
381 - Oh, honey, maybe we'd better\\
382 - forget the whole thing.\\
383 - Oh, no, I may go home without any
fingers,\\
384 - but I'm not going home empty-handed.\\
385 - Come on now, give me a hand with
this.\\
386 - All right.
Get it out.\\
387 - Are you all right with it?\\
388 - Yeah. Yeah.	    Huh?\\
389 - ETHEL: Can you tilt it a little for
me?\\
390 - Yeah.
This way?\\
391 - Ow!
Oh! Oh!\\
392 - Come on.	  Got it, honey?\\
393 - Yeah.
Get up together now.\\
394 - Okay. All right.\\
395 - Here we go.\\
396 - There we go.\\
397 - Just as I thought: a couple of cement
snatchers.\\
398 - Fred, how'd you know we were here?\\
399 - I thought you said he was home
snoring!\\
400 - He was snoring when I left.\\
401 - What woke you up?\\
402 - You did.\\
403 - I did? I wasn't even there!\\
404 - That's what did it.\\
405 - There was nobody poking me in the
ribs\\
406 - until I made a rollover.\\
407 - Now put that down!\\
408 - Oh, Fred, the hardest part is over.\\
409 - All we got to do is get it back to
New York.\\
410 - Put that down.\\
411 - Oh, Fred, go on home!\\
412 - I won't move out of here until
I've...\\
413 - (man whistling)\\
414 - Two cops coming up the block!\\
415 - Oh, easy now.
Easy! Easy!\\
416 - Oh!\\
417 - Put it...\\
418 - Who's, who's going first?\\
419 - I will, I will.\\
420 - Oh, come on, let's hide.\\
421 - Where? Where?\\
422 - Behind those bushes.
Get in there.\\
423 - Hurry up, Lucy.
Get in there!\\
424 - Oh!\\
425 - What's the matter?\\
426 - Oh, my foot's in the bucket!\\
427 - First time since I've been on this
beat.\\
428 - Yeah. There's always some joker\\
429 - trying to fit his feet into the
stars' footprints.\\
430 - Well, it takes Yeah.	     all
kinds.\\
431 - Take a look at the side door will
you?\\
432 - Yeah.\\
433 - (whistling)\\
434 - (imitating Gary Cooper): Yup.\\
435 - Well, Tyrone!\\
436 - Oh!\\
437 - Steve, don't tell anybody, huh?\\
438 - All right.\\
439 - Oh, boy, that was close.\\
440 - Come on.	I'll say it was.\\
441 - Let's get Come on, Lucy.    out of
here!\\
442 - Come on. Hurry up!
Come on, Lucy!\\
443 - I can't hurry.
Come on.\\
444 - It didn't harden?!\\
445 - Oh, didn't it!\\
446 - Well, we can get it off when we get
home.\\
447 - Come on, we got to get home.
Okay.\\
448 - I'm not going home without this.\\
449 - Come on, give me a hand.\\
450 - Oh, Lucy!\\
451 - Come on!\\
452 - Are you two dames out of your head?\\
453 - Wait a minute.
Wait, wait...\\
454 - I got it.\\
455 - Put the...\\
456 - Somebody else is coming now!\\
457 - Give me that!\\
458 - Give me!\\
459 - Oh, Fred!\\
460 - Hold it!
Look out!\\
461 - Go on, Ethel.\\
462 - Hurry up!\\
463 - I can't hurry!\\
464 - Wait for me!\\
465 - Here, Lucy.\\
466 - Come on.\\
467 - Come on.
Get around her.\\
468 - Come on.
Okay.\\
469 - Now run.
Run, honey!\\
470 - Hurry now!
Run!\\
471 - Hurry!		    Hurry!\\
472 - Come on!\\
473 - Oh...\\
474 - There!\\
475 - "There" what?\\
476 - Now what do we do?\\
477 - Well, we may have to blast.\\
478 - Oh, Fred...\\
479 - Oh, Ethel, I've just got to get this
thing off\\
480 - before Ricky sees it.
He'll kill me.\\
481 - Oh, brother! If he ever finds out
what we've done...\\
482 - Well, at least you can get away from
him.\\
483 - I have to stay here and take it.\\
484 - I'm like a sitting cement duck.\\
485 - That's true.\\
486 - Listen, if Ricky should come barging
in here,\\
487 - you both pick me up, aim my foot\\
488 - and we'll try to ram him.\\
489 - Oh, Lucy!\\
490 - Oh, there must be some way to get her
foot out of there.\\
491 - Now, let's everybody think.\\
492 - What are we gonna do?\\
493 - I don't know, but I'd hate to be\\
494 - the next shoe clerk that waits on
you.\\
495 - (phone ringing)\\
496 - Hello.\\
497 - Oh, hi, Ricky.\\
498 - Ricky!?\\
499 - ETHEL: Huh?\\
500 - Oh, yeah, yeah.\\
501 - Yeah, we were in bed asleep.\\
502 - Lucy? Lucy who?\\
503 - Oh, that Lucy.\\
504 - Yeah, she's here.\\
505 - What's she doing here?\\
506 - Uh, well, she was restless\\
507 - and she couldn't sleep,\\
508 - so she just wandered over here.\\
509 - (chuckling )\\
510 - No, I don't think there's any rea...\\
511 - Ricky? Ricky?!\\
512 - He's coming over here!\\
513 - What are we gonna to do?\\
514 - Get in bed! I told him we were
asleep!\\
515 - All right.
Oh.\\
516 - (Fred snoring)\\
517 - Fred! Give me a hand with my foot.\\
518 - "Give me a hand with my foot"!\\
519 - Get it up here.\\
520 - Hurry up. Then I got to cover it up.\\
521 - Careful now, it hurts.\\
522 - This is heavy!\\
523 - Come on, hurry up.
Go on, way up.\\
524 - Way up, hurry up, come on, Fred!\\
525 - Come on!\\
526 - Pull up. Cover it up.
Cover it up.\\
527 - Now tuck it in, right around there.\\
528 - Tuck it in.\\
529 - That's it.
Now get back in bed.\\
530 - Hurry up.\\
531 - (snoring)\\

534 - Lucy!\\
535 - Yeah, what? Huh? What?\\
536 - Oh, hello, dear.\\
537 - What are you doing here?\\
538 - Oh, I was restless and couldn't
sleep.\\
539 - Well, come on home.\\
540 - No, no. I can't seem to sleep in my
bed.\\
541 - Th-This couch is so comfortable.\\
542 - Just makes you want to drop right
off.\\
543 - Good night, dear.\\
544 - Good night, Ricky.\\
545 - Good night, Rick.\\

549 - Oh, no, I'm not!\\
550 - Yes, you are!
No, I'm not!\\

beauty sleep?\\
553 - You are going home.\\
554 - Come on.
Oh, Ricky.\\
555 - (groaning)\\
556 - Are you gaining weight?\\
557 - You feel like a block of cement.\\
558 - It's all those malts, dear.\\
559 - Put me back on the couch.\\
560 - Oh, Ricky, let her stay here.\\
561 - Put her down, you cad!\\
562 - All right.
Let's have the story.\\
563 - Story? What makes you think there's a
story?\\
564 - Well, the Mertzes are in their beds\\
565 - with their clothes on\\
566 - and you have your foot\\
567 - in what seems to be a block of
cement.\\
568 - I just thought there might be a
little explanation.\\
569 - You'd think so, wouldn't you?\\
570 - All right, Lucy.\\
571 - Let's have it.\\
572 - Well, uh, I was restless and couldn't
sleep.\\
573 - You see, I have this foot
condition...\\
574 - It's sort of a hardening of the
arches. I...\\
575 - I'm not buying that.\\
576 - Lucy, I want you to tell me the
truth.\\
577 - Yeah, well, I can't think\\
578 - with all this cement wrapped around
my foot.\\
579 - Oh, is that where your brains are?\\
580 - Let's see if I...\\
581 - Oh, here.\\
582 - I'll loosen it up for you.\\
583 - Sure.\\
584 - Ooh.\\
585 - Yeah.\\
586 - Oh, well.\\
587 - Thank you!\\
588 - Uh, well, come on, let's go home,
dear.\\
589 - RICKY: Lucy!\\
590 - Yes, sir?\\
591 - What happened?\\
592 - Uh...\\
593 - Well, I'll tell you what happened.\\
594 - Well, before you do, I'd better take
this.\\
595 - Well, I, uh... We went to Grauman's
Chinese Theatre\\
596 - on a routine souvenir hunt, and, uh,\\
597 - while we were there,\\
598 - we, uh, we saw this hunk of cement\\
599 - with John Wayne's footprints on it\\
600 - an-and we decided to-to swipe this
hunk of cement\\
601 - and while we were doing it, the cops
came along\\
602 - and we got scared and we tried to
hide in some bushes\\
603 - and that's just where Ethel had put
a... a big bucket of cement\\
604 - an-and, uh, and my foot got caught...
in it.\\
605 - Well, you've told me a lot of crazy
stories in your time,\\
606 - but this is the craziest.\\
607 - Now, come on, Fred, Ethel.
What's the truth?!\\
608 - She's telling the truth!\\
609 - That's the truth!
We got the block of cement\\
610 - right under the bed.\\
611 - Yeah, we'll show it to you.\\
612 - It sounded kind of silly\\
613 - when she was telling it, I'll admit.\\
614 - It's heavy, honey.\\
615 - John Wayne...
It's heavy.\\
616 - ETHEL: Ooh, look out, Fred.\\
617 - See, Rick? John Wayne.\\

624 - What's he saying?\\
625 - Well, I don't know, but I have an
idea it isn't\\
626 - "Hot diggety! Just what I've always
wanted."\\
627 - Lucy, you're taking that back right
now.\\
628 - After all I went through to get it?\\
629 - No, I don't want to, Ricky!\\
630 - Lucy, you take that back where it
belongs.\\
631 - Come on!\\
632 - Well, okay.\\
633 - Come on, Ethel.\\
634 - Give me a hand.\\
635 - Yeah.\\
636 - Careful.\\
637 - It's heavy.\\
638 - Be careful, Ethel.
Don't drop it.\\
639 - Look out.\\
640 - Yeah. You got it?\\
641 - Yep. Got it?\\
642 - Yeah. Okay.\\
643 - We'll take it back where it belongs,

650 - You scared me.\\
651 - You take that back.\\

671 - Did you put it back?\\
672 - What do you mean, "no"? Why not?\\
673 - Well, Ricky, we... dropped it\\
674 - and it broke in ten million little
pieces.\\
675 - What!\\
676 - Where's Lucy?\\
677 - Well, we heard the cops coming again\\
678 - and we started to run and that's how
we broke it.\\
679 - Where is Lucy?\\

170 - and there's no footprints in the
forecourt!\\
171 - LUCY: Oh, no!\\
172 - Well, kids, our troubles are all
over.\\
173 - I just made a duplicate\\
174 - of John Wayne's footprints.\\
175 - Now, now, now, now, don't touch it.\\
176 - It's still wet.\\
177 - How do you like it?\\
178 - Oh, it's pretty awful, Fred.\\
179 - Well, it's terrible, Fred.\\
180 - That's no good.\\
181 - What's wrong with it?\\
182 - Well, for one thing, the feet are way
too big.\\
183 - Yeah. I guess I shouldn't have used
Ethel's shoes.\\
184 - Besides, the real footprints\\
185 - were made with Western boots, not
shoes.\\
186 - And you don't spell Wayne "W-a-i-n."\\
187 - W-a-y-n-e.\\
188 - Oh, I'll go make another one.\\
189 - Oh, forget it, Fred.\\
190 - You know, it's dishonest to forge
footprints.\\
191 - Yeah.\\
192 - Look who's turning honest\\
193 - all of a sudden--\\
194 - Dishwater Mertz and Frowsy Ricardo.\\
195 - LUCY: Don't use that expression again
if you don't mind.\\
196 - (phone rings)\\

Hello.\\

206 - We forgot our hairdressing
appointment.\\
207 - Oh, my...\\
208 - Are you kidding?!\\
209 - You're gonna your hair done at a time
like this?!\\
210 - If I have to go to jail,\\
211 - I do not want to be referred to as a
Frowsy Redhead!\\
212 - What am I gonna do?\\
213 - Well, you can always shoot yourself.\\
214 - Well, come on, think of something.\\
215 - Well...\\
216 - What's the matter with me?\\
217 - Why don't I call Duke?\\
218 - Who?\\
219 - Duke-- John Wayne.\\
220 - All his friends call him Duke.\\
221 - Oh.
He's a wonderful guy!\\
222 - I had lunch with him at the studio a
couple of times.\\
223 - I'll bet you he'll help me out.\\
224 - Yeah, well, what if he won't?\\
225 - Then I'll shoot myself.\\
226 - Fred, what do you think of that?\\
227 - Good. Looks nice and smooth.\\
228 - Yeah, I think so.\\
229 - Yeah.
(phone ringing)\\
230 - Hello?\\
231 - Oh! Send him right up, please.\\
232 - Thank you.\\
233 - He's here.\\
234 - He's sure an all right guy.\\
235 - Say, Rick, is it really true\\
236 - that John Wayne is as tough as he
appears to be on the screen?\\
237 - Well, he's pretty big and well-built.\\
238 - Yeah, well, I heard a fella in the
barbershop said\\
239 - the other day that when you shake
hands with John Wayne,\\
240 - it's like putting your fingers in a
vise.\\
241 - Well, I don't know about that.\\
242 - Well, I got a pretty good grip
myself, you know.\\
243 - Fred, you're not going to act like a
cornball, are you?\\
244 - Oh, now, don't worry.\\
245 - I'm going over to get Ethel's
autograph book.\\
246 - She'll want his signature.\\
247 - All right.\\
248 - If you annoy him, enough, you may
find out how tough he is.\\
249 - All right, all right.\\
250 - Hi, Duke!\\
251 - Hey!\\
252 - Hi!\\
253 - Good to see you.\\
254 - Nice to see you, Duke.\\
255 - It-it's sure great of you to help me
out this way.\\
256 - Oh, well, I'm glad to.\\
257 - I'm very flattered that your wife is
such a fan of mine,\\
258 - stealing my footprints.\\
259 - Is she here?\\
260 - No, no.\\
261 - Oh, well, that's too bad.\\
262 - I've heard a lot about her-- from
Bill Holden.\\
263 - Oh, yeah. Right.\\
264 - 'Course...\\
265 - I accused him of making a lot of it
up.\\
266 - Yeah, well, uh, look, uh, John, uh,
speaking of-of fans,\\
267 - I have a friend of mine that lives
next door here,\\
268 - and I think he's gonna come over and
ask for your autograph.\\
269 - I hope you don't mind.\\
270 - Oh, absolutely not.\\
271 - I'm afraid of the day they won't want
it.\\
272 - Well, I also have an awful hunch\\
273 - that he's gonna try to shake hands
with you\\
274 - and try to find out how strong your
grip is.\\
275 - Oh, another one Yeah.	     of
those, eh?\\
276 - Well, if he's a friend of yours,
we'll humor him.\\
277 - Hi!\\
278 - Hi, Count!\\
279 - Not "Count." Duke.\\
280 - "Mr. Wayne" to you.\\
281 - John, this is Fred Mertz.\\
282 - Howdy, pardner!\\
283 - How do ya do-o-o-o-o...?\\
284 - Ooh!\\
285 - I'm sorry.\\
286 - You've got quite a grip there, fella.\\
287 - Yeah, well, I used to box a little\\
288 - when I was a young fella.
Really?\\
289 - Fred, don't press your luck, huh?\\
290 - Oh, no, no.
I'm sorry.\\
291 - Hey, I forgot.\\
292 - Would you sign my wife's autograph
book for me?\\
293 - Well, I'd be glad to...\\
294 - Here's a pencil.\\
295 - ...as soon as I can get some blood
back in this hand.\\
296 - Rick, Ethel's gonna flip when she
sees this.\\
297 - Yeah, well, let's get going with the
footprints\\
298 - We don't want to waste John's time.\\
299 - Thank ya, Count.\\
300 - Duke.\\
301 - I wore the same shoes I had on\\
302 - when I made this the first time.\\
303 - Oh, that's great.\\
304 - Yeah, just put them right in there.\\
305 - That's it.\\
306 - Now we get the other one.\\
307 - Here. That's it.\\
308 - Here, Rick.\\
309 - Here. That's it.
Attaboy.\\
310 - I'll take it.\\
311 - (grunting)\\
312 - I tell you what--\\
313 - we'd better get downstairs and get
these boots shined.\\
314 - All right, Rick.
Fine.\\
315 - Now for the signature,\\
316 - let's put it on top of the table,
huh?\\
317 - All right.\\
318 - Oh, oh, oh, oh!\\
319 - Don't strain yourself.\\
320 - I'll handle that.\\
321 - Kinda heavy.\\
322 - (spitting)\\
323 - Well, I was just too nervous to sit
there, that's all.\\
324 - Well, you might have let me take the
curlers out of my hair.\\
325 - You could. I can think with curlers
in my hair.\\
326 - Now, for heaven's sake, I got a few
things on my...\\
327 - Oh, look.\\
328 - Freddy the Forger strikes again!\\
329 - No, the writing is different.\\
330 - I think Ricky did this.\\
331 - Well, nice try,\\
332 - but they'll never get away with it.\\
333 - Oh, dear, what's the matter with
those characters?\\
334 - They can't forge a thing like this.\\
335 - Millions of people have seen this.\\
336 - Everybody knows what John Wayne's
signature looks like.\\
337 - Look what I got for you, honeybunch.\\
338 - What?\\
339 - Oh...\\
340 - What is it?\\
341 - "Good luck. John Wayne."\\
342 - Oh, Fred.\\
343 - Oh, honestly, Fred.\\
344 - I'm surprised\\
345 - you haven't started forging his name
on checks.\\
346 - What do you mean?!\\
347 - That's John Wayne's signature.\\
348 - Oh, sure.\\
349 - Yes, it is...\\
350 - Hi.\\
351 - Hey, Rick, They don't believe\\
352 - that's John Wayne's signature.\\
353 - Sure it is.
He signed it\\
354 - while he was here a few minutes ago.\\
355 - He wa...\\
356 - He was... He wa...?\\
357 - Wha...? Wha...? Wha...?\\
358 - I thought you'd be surprised.\\
359 - I don't believe it!\\
360 - Sure, honey. He's down there in the
lobby\\
361 - getting his boots shined.\\
362 - Yeah.
He got them all dirty\\
363 - when he stuck the boots in th...\\
364 - No! No!\\
365 - I'm sorry, honey!\\
366 - What happened?!\\
367 - I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I didn't know!\\
368 - We thought it was some more\\
369 - of little Freddy's finger painting.\\
370 - Oh, no!\\
371 - Oh, honey, honey, I'm sorry.\\
372 - Look, you said he's downstairs.\\
373 - Why don't go get him, ask him to do
it again?\\
374 - I can't do that.\\
375 - Well, why not?
He-he'll understand.\\
376 - He's in movies.
Tell him it's a retake.\\
377 - Well, all right, all I have to do is
go to jail.\\
378 - Your whole career will be ruined.\\
379 - Yes.\\
380 - All right.\\
381 - All right.\\
382 - Mira que tengo que...\\
383 - Mira que tengo que ir abajo y decirle
al hombre\\
384 - que ponga el foot en el cemento otra
vez!\\
385 - Oh, Lucy, that was a great idea.\\
386 - Gee, we not only get off the hook,\\
387 - but we get to meet John Wayne in
person.\\
388 - Right up here.\\
389 - Oh, John Wayne!\\
390 - Oh, I can hardly wait.\\
391 - He's so big and strong\\
392 - and rugged.\\
393 - Ha!\\
394 - What do you mean, "Ha"?\\
395 - Well, he may be big and strong and
rugged,\\
396 - but I'm bigger and stronger and
ruggeder.\\
397 - Oh, Fred, what are you babbling
about?\\
398 - They say he's got a grip like a vise,\\
399 - but he was like putty\\
400 - in the hands of Old Bone Crusher
Mertz!\\
401 - Oh, honestly, Fred, you're really
gone.\\
402 - Well, I mean it!\\
403 - When I gave him the iron grip,\\
404 - he went right down to his knees!\\
405 - Here. I'll show you.\\
406 - Like that?\\
407 - Yeah, you big bully.\\
408 - Oh, honestly, Fred.\\
409 - There we are--\\

429 - I... I'm so terribly sorry.\\
430 - I-I wasn't ready for it.\\
431 - Does she always wear her pocketbook
on her head?\\

apology.\\

451 - You know, when you were up in that
plane,\\
452 - in The High and the Mighty,\\
453 - when your motor conked out,\\

478 - John, I promise you.\\
479 - John, I promise you.\\
480 - This will be the last time.\\
481 - Well, I'm afraid it'll have to be.\\
482 - As much as I love stepping in wet
cement,\\
483 - I'm afraid I'll be late at the
studio.\\
484 - Well, you keep making those pictures
for us.\\
485 - Bye, John.	Good-bye.\\
486 - Don't you quit.\\
487 - Good-bye!\\
488 - Good-bye, John.\\
489 - Oh...\\
490 - Isn't he a wonderful guy?\\
491 - He is, Rick.\\
492 - Well, all we have to do now\\
493 - is take the block of cement to
Grauman's Chinese\\
494 - and everything is straightened out.\\
495 - Eh, Lucy?\\
496 - Lucy?\\
497 - Lucy!\\
498 - Come on, honey, let's get the block
of cement.\\
499 - We'll take it to the theater, huh?\\
500 - Come on.     Okay.\\
501 - Oh, no!\\
502 - Oh!	Oh!\\
503 - Oh, no!\\
504 - I'm telling you, I walked around for
two hours\\
505 - before I got enough nerve to come
over here\\
506 - and ask you to do it again.\\
507 - (grunting)\\
508 - My wife doesn't know I'm here.\\
509 - (straining)\\
510 - I suppose those things happen.\\
511 - Pardon me, Ricky.\\
512 - That's okay.\\
513 - (knock on door)\\
514 - Come in.\\
515 - Is this okay to go on with, Mr.
Wayne?\\
516 - Looks okay to me.\\
517 - Better check with Mr. Wellman.\\
518 - Thank you.\\
519 - (phone ringing)\\
520 - Hello!\\
521 - Oh.\\
522 - Your wife and her friend are at the
gate.\\
523 - I tell you what.\\
524 - Pretend you're mad.\\
525 - Pretend?\\
526 - (snickering)\\
527 - Let them stew for a while,\\
528 - and then we'll surprise them with
this, you see.\\
529 - Tell them, "No!"\\
530 - No!\\
531 - "Absolutely not!"\\
532 - Absolutely not!\\
533 - "Don't bother me with a thing like
that no more!"\\
534 - Don't bother me with a thing like
that no more!\\
535 - Ready for your rubdown?\\
536 - Oh, don't bother with that.
George'll...\\
537 - Oh, I insist.\\
538 - This is the least I can do.\\
539 - MAN: Ready on the set, Mr. Wayne,\\
540 - for the beach scene!\\
541 - Okay!\\
542 - George, you'll have to wait till
after this scene.\\
543 - Okay.\\
544 - Sorry, Ricky, I'll have to get on the
set.\\
545 - Sure, sure.\\
546 - How can I ever thank you?\\
547 - Make this the last time.\\
548 - (chuckling): Okay, sure. Okay.\\
549 - (door shuts)\\
550 - (whispering :)
Go ahead. Closer to the...\\
551 - (grunting)\\
552 - Wait. That's enough.\\
553 - Ooh!\\
554 - There.\\
555 - Oh, Lucy, are you sure that'll work?\\
556 - Listen, when Mr. Wayne comes out of
his dressing room,\\
557 - he must step down there.\\
558 - That way, we will have his
footprints.\\
559 - It's that simple.\\
560 - What about his signature?\\
561 - Once we have his footprints, how can
he refuse to sign?\\
562 - I don't see how can he refuse\\
563 - to punch you in the nose.\\
564 - (door opening)\\
565 - (thudding and clattering)\\
566 - Oh!\\
567 - Ricky, what are you doing here?\\
568 - I came... I came...\\
569 - Aah...\\
570 - (angry muttering)\\
571 - He didn't even say good-bye.\\
572 - Oh, Lucy, look.\\
573 - He came down here\\
574 - to get John Wayne's footprints again.\\
575 - Ethel, we're saved.\\
576 - The signature, it isn't touched, see?\\
577 - All I have to do now is go in there,\\
578 - steal a pair of his boots, make the
imprints\\
579 - and our troubles are over.\\
580 - Okay.\\
581 - I'll get this stuff out of here.\\
582 - All right.\\
583 - (footsteps approaching)\\
584 - WAYNE: Well, give me five...
ten minutes, will ya?\\
585 - I want to get a rubdown.\\
586 - Ah...\\
587 - George?\\
588 - (gruff voice): Yeah?\\
589 - Let's get on with the rubdown.\\
590 - Hurry it up!\\
591 - I haven't got all day.\\
592 - Oh, cut the comedy, George.\\
593 - Get on with the rubdown.\\
594 - The robe, George!\\
595 - Harder.\\
596 - You heard any good stories lately,
George?\\
597 - Nope.\\
598 - Oh, I heard a beaut\\
599 - in the steam room the other day.\\
600 - It seems there was this traveling
salesman...\\
601 - (grunting)\\
602 - ...who couldn't find a hotel room\\
603 - in this town...\\
604 - but he did find a farmer\\
605 - who had a beautiful daughter.\\
606 - Hey! Take it easy, will ya?\\
607 - Well, anyway, it was raining
outside...\\
608 - (knocking)\\

612 - They want you on the set.\\
613 - Okay.\\
614 - George, I'm wanted on the set.\\
615 - George!\\
616 - Are you ready for your rub now?\\
617 - You just gave me one!\\
618 - I just got here.\\
619 - I'm beginning to worry about you,
George.\\
620 - You're getting punchy!\\
621 - I don't know.
I don't know.\\
622 - I just ran out of his dressing room\\
623 - and I was so scared, I just came on
home.\\
624 - I don't know what happened to Ethel.\\
625 - Well, let's just hope for the best.\\
626 - Don't worry, Fred.
She'll show up.\\
627 - I said let's hope for the best.\\
628 - Fred, I am worried about Ethel.\\
629 - Hi.\\
630 - LUCY: Hi.\\
631 - Come on in, Duke.\\
632 - LUCY: Duke?!\\
633 - I told him what happened and he was
just a doll.\\
634 - Oh, Mr. Wayne, I'm so...!\\
635 - Oh, you're so wonderful!\\
636 - Thank you so much.\\
637 - John, I don't know how to thank you.\\
638 - Oh, that's so wonderful of you.\\
639 - And we're gonna take good care of
that.\\
640 - Don't you worry.\\
641 - And I took care of that, too.
Come in here!\\
642 - I brought you a six-month supply!\\

2 - ANNOUNCER: And now, I Love Lucy.\\
3 - (applause)\\
4 - Hello, hello.\\
5 - (screaming)\\
6 - Oh!\\
7 - It's just a model of my head\\
8 - that the studio made for the trick
shots.\\
9 - Oh, what a terrible thing to do.\\
10 - Don't you ever come home with two
heads again.\\
11 - Not-not bad, huh?\\
12 - Same eyes, same nose, same lips.\\
13 - Can't tell the difference, can you?\\
14 - Nope.\\
15 - Lucy...\\
16 - I'm only kidding.\\
17 - You kiss much better.\\
18 - Sheesh, what a wonderful souvenir to
take back home\\
19 - and I know just what to do with it.\\
20 - We'll put it on top of the piano.\\
21 - Oh, great.\\
22 - No, really, I think it would look
wonder...\\
23 - Hey, it'd make a wonderful lamp!\\
24 - Lamp?\\
25 - Yeah, look.\\
26 - Sure, a little longer neck,\\
27 - you'd make a wonderful floor lamp.\\
28 - I'm going to take a shower.\\
29 - I'd better get this out of the way.\\
30 - If little Ricky sees this, it'll
scare him to pieces.\\
31 - (laughing)\\
32 - Gee, if I just had two of these
heads,\\
33 - they'd make wonderful bookends.\\
34 - Yeah, but don't get any ideas.\\
35 - Oh...\\
36 - Hey, I forgot to tell you.\\
37 - I made a date to go dipsy fishing.\\
38 - Dipsy fishing?\\
39 - Yeah, you know, in the ocean.\\
40 - Oh! Deep-sea fishing.\\
41 - I'm leaving tomorrow morning.\\
42 - No.\\
43 - And don't stick your tongue out at
me.\\
44 - Oh, honey, I promise I won't say a
word\\
45 - while the fish are biting.\\
46 - (shower running)
Oh...\\
47 - About this dipsy fishing...\\
48 - Now, you know I'm not the kind of
girl that talks...\\
49 - (phone ringing)\\
50 - Will you excuse me?\\
51 - Thank you very much.\\
52 - (ringing)\\
53 - Hello?\\
54 - MAN: Is Ricky Ricardo there?\\
55 - Yes, he is, but he's busy right now.\\
56 - Could I take a message?\\
57 - Yeah. This is Chip Jackson over at
MGM.\\
58 - Oh.\\
59 - We're having a studio party tomorrow
night\\
60 - and we thought Ricky could help
entertain\\
61 - in a show we're putting on for the
executives.\\
62 - Well, I'm sorry, but he's...\\
63 - For the executives?\\
64 - Mm-hmm. All the big shots will be
there.\\
65 - (shower running)
Well, uh...\\
66 - Mr. Ricardo does do an act with Mrs.
Ricardo,\\
67 - a great undiscovered talent,\\
68 - and, uh, if he could, uh, a-appear
with Mrs. Ricardo,\\
69 - I think he would do it.\\
70 - He doesn't like to appear without
her.\\
71 - She's really very talented.\\
72 - Hello, hello?
Are you still there?\\
73 - Uh... yes. Uh... eh, eh, is Mrs.
Ricardo really good?\\
74 - Is she? I'll say I am-- she am. She
is.\\
75 - Uh... well, uh.... well, as long as
we can get Mr. Ricardo.\\
76 - Well, now just a moment, and I'll
check with him.\\
77 - Ricky?\\
78 - Yeah?!\\
79 - MGM's on the wire.\\
80 - They want to know if you'll appear\\
81 - at a studio party tomorrow night.\\
82 - Absolutely not!
I'm going fishing!\\
83 - He says he'd love to.\\
84 - Oh, fine. Meet at Fox Century.\\
85 - Oh, they'll be there. Bye.\\
86 - Did you tell them?\\
87 - Yeah, I told them.\\
88 - That's too bad about the studio
party, honey,\\
89 - but nobody's gonna keep me from this
fishing trip.\\
90 - I don't know why you want to go
fishing anyway.\\
91 - You know you're not gonna catch any
fish.\\
92 - Why do you say that?\\
93 - Well, you know the old saying:\\
94 - You can't catch fish in a month that
has an "R" in it.\\
95 - That's for oysters.\\
96 - Oh.\\
97 - What's the matter?
Don't you want me to go?\\
98 - Oh, sure, I do.
I-It's just that...\\
99 - I'll miss you.\\
100 - Oh, now, honey, I'll only be gone a
couple of days.\\
101 - All right, all right, go ahead and
go.\\
102 - I don't care...\\
103 - I don't care if you'd rather go
fishing than be with me.\\
104 - Oh, now, honey.\\
105 - You love fish better than you do your
own wife.\\
106 - Now, that's not true.\\
107 - You should have married a barracuda!\\
108 - All right, all right.\\
109 - If it will make you happy, I'll take
you with me.\\
110 - Oh...\\
111 - I don't want to go!\\
112 - What is this?
You don't want to go.\\
113 - You don't want me to go.
What do you want?\\
114 - I want you to go\\
115 - to the studio party tomorrow night.\\
116 - Uh-huh. I knew there was something
cooking\\
117 - in that little brain of yours.\\
118 - Why are you so interested\\
119 - that I go to the studio party
tomorrow night?\\
120 - You want the truth?\\
121 - That would be refreshing, yes.\\
122 - The whole truth?\\
123 - That would be even more refreshing.\\
124 - I lied.\\
125 - That sounds like the truth.\\
126 - I told them that you and I would do
an act together.\\
127 - Oh, no!\\
128 - Oh, now, Ricky, please!\\
129 - Oh, no. I'm going fishing.\\
130 - But, honey, I already told the
studio.\\
131 - Well, then you will have to tell the
studio\\
132 - that you made a mistake.\\
133 - I will not.\\
134 - You will, too. Hi.\\
135 - Hi.
Hi.\\
136 - I can't do that. Hi.\\
137 - Hi.
Hi.\\
138 - Why can't you?\\
139 - Because that would be lying.\\
140 - Well, I don't want to hear one more
word about it.\\
141 - Oh, Ricky, now, please!\\
142 - Let's get out of here.\\
143 - And miss this?\\
144 - LUCY: You stay here for the studio
party or you'll be sorry.\\
145 - Now, Lucy, don't threaten me. Let go.\\
146 - No!\\
147 - Let go!\\
148 - Oh, Ricky!\\
149 - Ouch!\\
150 - Well, it serves you right!\\
151 - Ricky, talk to me.\\
152 - Oh...\\
153 - Let's go.\\
154 - Where are you going?\\
155 - (screaming)\\
156 - I knew someday he'd go too far.\\
157 - Oh, this is just a model of Ricky's
head\\
158 - he brought home from the studio.\\
159 - Oh, Lucy, you almost scared me to
death with that thing.\\
160 - It looks exactly like Ricky.\\
161 - Doesn't it?\\
162 - Looks so much like him,\\
163 - I'd like to punch it in the nose.\\
164 - Hey, that's fun!\\
165 - Yeah, yeah.\\
166 - Yeah, dipsy fishing, huh?\\
167 - Dipsy fishing. Yeah.\\
168 - Ricky, after all I've said, you're
still going fishing?\\
169 - Oh, no, no, honey. No.\\
170 - I'm going golfing.\\
171 - Oh, you're impossible.\\
172 - No, you're the one who's impossible.\\
173 - I happen to be very possible.\\
174 - Well, I got to get going.\\
175 - Ricky, please?\\
176 - Nope.\\
177 - Please do the number with me just
this once.\\
178 - Absolutely not!\\
179 - Oh!\\
180 - They're always showing\\
181 - the same old movie on this channel.\\
182 - Well, so long.\\
183 - See you in a couple of days.\\
184 - No, wait. Fred, in all the years
you've been married,\\
185 - have you ever left Ethel alone to go
fishing?\\
186 - Nope.\\
187 - You see? He loves his wife.\\
188 - He's devoted, considerate.\\
189 - And what's more, he gets seasick.\\
190 - No, I do not get seasick.\\
191 - Hah! He gets queasy if I have too
many waves in my hair.\\
192 - Well, I got to get going.\\
193 - You think someone would kiss me
good-bye.\\
194 - Well, don't look at me.\\
195 - See you in a couple of days.
Bye.\\
196 - Have a good time, Rick.
Good-bye, Rick.\\
197 - Thank you.
Catch us a fish.\\
198 - I'll try to get you some.
All right.\\
199 - Oh... some husband I've got.\\
200 - If my mother wasn't living with us,
I'd go home to her.\\
201 - Well, what are you gonna do?\\
202 - Call up the studio and tell them you
can't make it?\\
203 - No. I can make it.\\
204 - I'll tell them Ricky can't make it.\\
205 - They won't want you without Ricky.\\
206 - Why do you say that?!\\
207 - Because it's the truth.\\
208 - Well, I know, but why do you say it?\\
209 - I got to get an idea.\\
210 - Okay, we'll leave you here to think.\\
211 - Come on, Fred.\\
212 - All right.\\
213 - Here, Lucy, two heads are better than
one.\\
214 - Oh...\\
215 - Lucy?! Lucy?!\\
216 - Yeah?\\
217 - What did you want to see us about?\\
218 - Yeah, I'm eating my lunch.\\
219 - LUCY: Oh, I'm sorry, Fred.\\
220 - Listen, Ethel, turn on that record of
Ricky's and sit down,\\
221 - and I have something very important
to show you.\\
222 - What's going on here?\\
223 - I don't know.\\
224 - (upbeat music playing)\\
225 - When we are dancing and you're
dangerously near me\\
226 - I get ideas\\
227 - I get ideas\\
228 - I want to hold you so much closer
than I dare to\\
229 - I want to scold you\\
230 - 'Cause I care more than I care to\\
231 - And when you touch me\\
232 - And there's a smile in every fac...\\
233 - What do you think?
You think it'll work?\\
234 - Think what'll work?\\
235 - Well, my dance for the studio club.\\
236 - Do you think they'll know it's a
dummy?\\
237 - Nobody but the audience.\\
238 - Aw! Didn't it fool you at all?\\
239 - Nope. The dummy's a better dancer
than Ricky.\\
240 - Oh, Fred! It fooled me for a couple
of seconds.\\
241 - Did it?\\
242 - It sure did.\\
243 - Then I can fool an audience that
long.\\
244 - Now, this is what I want to do.\\
245 - I want to dance out on the stage with
Raggedy Ricky here,\\
246 - I dance around a little bit\\
247 - and then he'll be suddenly taken ill,
see,\\
248 - and I'll help him off the stage\\
249 - and I'll come back and finish the
number by myself.\\
250 - You'll never get away with it.	    
No.\\
251 - Well, I will if you help me.\\
252 - Well, so long, Lucy.\\
253 - Come on, Fred.\\
254 - Now, Ethel!
I want you to help me.\\
255 - Not a chance.\\
256 - Why not, Ethel?\\
257 - What?!\\
258 - Good boy, Fred.\\
259 - Are you out of your mind?\\
260 - Now, look, we're going to give in
eventually--\\
261 - we always do-- and if we say no now,\\
262 - she'll keep us around here arguing
all afternoon.\\
263 - So, why don't we say yes right away\\
264 - and then I can go ahead with my
lunch.\\
265 - Oh, you're absolutely right, Fred!\\
266 - Now here's what I want to tell you
about.\\
267 - Oh, you can't hear this.\\
268 - Now, this is ridiculously simple.\\
269 - All I...\\
270 - (knocking at door)\\
271 - Come on in. Hurry.\\
272 - Did you have much trouble?
A little.\\
273 - Well, The guard at the gate wanted to
smell his breath,\\
274 - but I talked him out of it.\\
275 - You know, I'm getting fond of this
guy.\\
276 - Put him right down here.\\
277 - Okay. Come on, Esteban.\\
278 - Thank you very, very much.\\
279 - Oh, that's beautiful!\\
280 - Where did you get it?\\
281 - At a costume company.\\

Don't be alarmed.\\
314 - In the tradition of our business,
though,\\
315 - the show must go on.\\

322 - (whispering)\\
323 - Hold still.\\
324 - Get the arm off.\\
325 - Straighten my mantilla out in the
back.\\
326 - Straighten it way out.\\
327 - Are you ready?\\
328 - I got it.\\
329 - Okay, here I go.\\
330 - Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Ricky
Ricardo.\\
331 - (applause)
Wait! Wait.\\
332 - When we are dancing\\
333 - And you're dangerously near me\\
334 - I get ideas\\
335 - I get ideas\\
336 - I want to hold you so much closer
than I dare to...\\
337 - What a trooper.\\
338 - I want to scold you\\
339 - But I care more than I care to\\
340 - And when you touch me\\
341 - And when there's fire in every finger\\
342 - I get ideas\\
343 - I get ideas\\
344 - And after we have kissed good night\\
345 - And still you linger...\\
346 - I kinda think you get ideas, too\\
347 - (off-key): Your eyes...\\
348 - Your, your, your, your, your, your,
your...\\
349 - eyes are always saying\\
350 - The things I hope they're saying\\
351 - I only hope they're saying\\
352 - That you would love me, too\\
353 - 'Cause that's the whole idea, it's
true\\
354 - The lovely idea\\
355 - That I've fallen in love with you.\\
356 - (song ends, but musical refrain
continues)\\
357 - (applause)\\
358 - (music and applause continuing)\\
359 - Oh, Fred, what are we gonna tell
Ricky?\\
360 - Well, I maintain that honesty is the
best policy.\\
361 - I know, but what are we gonna tell
Ricky?\\
362 - Hi, everybody.\\
363 - Hi, Rick.
Hi, Rick.\\
364 - Where's Lucy?\\
365 - Uh, did you catch a lot of fish?\\
366 - No, it was too shoppy.\\
367 - You know, when it's that shoppy,\\
368 - there's not much fish.\\
369 - Where's Lucy?\\
370 - Uh, "shoppy," huh?\\
371 - Oh, yeah, I'm telling you, all the
way to Catalina,\\
372 - the boat just roll and roll and roll
and roll\\
373 - and then it pitch forward and goes
back\\
374 - and it roll and it roll.\\
375 - I'm telling you, it was terrible.\\
376 - All the way through.\\
377 - Hey, Rick, get me off this boat.\\
378 - (laughing): I'm sorry, Fred.\\
379 - Where's Lucy?\\
380 - Did she go out?\\
381 - Oh, uh, she, uh...\\
382 - Ethel, where's Lucy?\\
383 - Ricky, Lucy's got a job.\\
384 - What?!\\
385 - She went to that studio party last
night.\\
386 - Oh, you two were a sensation.\\
387 - Who two?\\
388 - You and Lucy.\\
389 - What are you talking about?\\
390 - Wait a minute. I'll show you.\\
391 - What is she babbling about?\\
392 - (singing melody to "I Get Ideas")\\
393 - Oh... no.\\
394 - How could she have gotten away with
it?\\
395 - She didn't, but it was such a mess,\\
396 - they thought it was a comedy act\\
397 - and they offered her a year's
contract!\\
398 - That's where she is now, over there
talking over terms.\\
399 - I can't believe it.\\
400 - Oh, Ricky, you can't let her sign
that contract.\\
401 - She'd have to stay out here a whole
year.\\
402 - She can't do that.\\
403 - But you can stop her, can't you,
Rick?\\
404 - 'Course I stop her. Huh!\\
405 - I'll just tell her, "You just can't
take this contract.\\
406 - What do you think, you're gonna..."\\
407 - Wait a minute.\\
408 - I can't stop her.\\
409 - If I do, she'll throw it in my face\\
410 - for the rest of my life.\\
411 - He's right.\\
412 - But you'd better think up something
fast.\\
413 - She'll be home any minute.\\
414 - Well, let's see...\\
415 - I tell you what.\\
416 - We'll use physiocology.\\
417 - What?!\\
418 - Physiocology.\\
419 - You know, when you want somebody to
do something,\\
420 - you make them think you want them to
do something else.\\
421 - Physicology.\\
422 - Physicology?\\
423 - Yes, honey, you know, what a
physichiatrist use.\\
424 - That's a head doctor.\\
425 - Oh, psychology.\\
426 - FRED: Oh.\\
427 - All right, have it your own way.\\
428 - Look, here's what we're gonna do.\\
429 - When she comes in...\\
430 - LUCY: I get ideas, I get ideas...\\
431 - Follow my lead.\\
432 - Ethel, I'm gonna sign the contract
tomorrow.\\
433 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
434 - Hi, there.\\
435 - Did you hear the news?\\
436 - Yes, yes.\\
437 - The Mertzes told me all about it.\\
438 - Oh.\\
439 - And I think it's wonderful.\\
440 - You do?\\
441 - Yes, I certainly do.\\
442 - I was afraid you'd be angry with me.\\
443 - Angry? Well, honey, why should I be
angry?\\
444 - Just because you took a dummy over to
the studio\\
445 - and made him pass as your husband?\\
446 - (chuckling): Why, honey...\\
447 - that is exactly what any...\\
448 - any normal, red-blooded, American
girl would have done.\\
449 - Oh, boy, you must have caught a lot
of fish.\\
450 - No, no, no, I'm sincerely glad.\\
451 - This is what you've always wanted to
do\\
452 - and now you've done it.\\
453 - Gee, you're really glad, huh?\\
454 - Yeah.\\
455 - Oh, Lucy, this is so exciting.\\
456 - Oh, boy, I can hardly wait till I get
my first big picture.\\
457 - Yeah, well, you'll have to be sure
and write to us\\
458 - and tell us all about it.\\
459 - Oh, don't worry...\\
460 - What do you mean, write?\\
461 - Well, honey, Little Ricky and me\\
462 - and the Mertzes are gonna be back in
New York\\
463 - and you'll be out here...\\
464 - Oh, no, no, you're all gonna be out
here with me.\\
465 - Oh, I'm sorry, I can't do that.\\
466 - I have a contract at the Tropicana.\\
467 - I open there in a couple of weeks.\\
468 - Oh, we've left our apartment house\\
469 - much too long already.\\
470 - Yeah, after all, we're still the
landlords.\\
471 - Well, gee, I know, but...\\
472 - Now, honey, you cannot let\\
473 - your family and your best friends\\
474 - interfere with your professional
career.\\
475 - Well, I know, but...\\
476 - And, besides, it's not like\\
477 - we were gonna be millions of miles
away.\\
478 - You can come and visit us every
Christmas.\\
479 - And you can call us as often as you
like.\\
480 - That's right. And don't you worry
about Little Ricky.\\
481 - I'll show him your picture every
night,\\
482 - so he won't forget his mommy.\\
483 - Oh, no, no! I gotta have Little Ricky\\
484 - and all of you out here.\\
485 - Now, look, Ricky, you can book your
band out here someplace,\\
486 - you know that, and if it's a matter
of money,\\
487 - I'll be making a large salary.\\
488 - I'll, I'll pay all your expenses.\\
489 - Oh, thanks, honey, but I'm afraid
not.\\
490 - Well, now, wait a minute, Ethel.\\
491 - I'm sorry, I-I'm afraid we can't.\\
492 - No, no, we really have to go,\\
493 - but that doesn't mean that you have
to, you know.\\
494 - Honey, what's the matter?\\
495 - You look sad.\\
496 - We're happy for you.\\
497 - FRED: Yeah.\\
498 - This is what you've always wanted:\\
499 - a career in show business.\\
500 - We're really happy for you.\\
501 - Aren't you happy?\\
502 - Yeah.\\
503 - Yeah, I'm happy.\\
504 - I'm very happy...\\
505 - I guess.\\
506 - RICKY: You can't let your family and
best friends\\
507 - interfere with your career.\\
508 - ETHEL: You can call us as often as
you like.\\
509 - RICKY: We'll show the baby your
picture,\\
510 - so he'll know who his mommy is.\\
511 - LUCY: I'm sorry, sir, but I've
decided to go home\\
512 - and be with my family.\\
513 - MAN: You're making a big mistake, my
dear.\\
514 - We have great plans for you.\\
515 - We're certain that you'll be a big
star.\\
516 - Big star.\\
517 - Big star.\\
518 - Big star.\\
519 - LUCY: Oh, yes, yes, I'm Lucy Ricardo.\\
520 - My autograph? Of course.\\
521 - I don't mind.\\
522 - When people stop asking, that's when
I'll mind.\\
523 - Oh, you're welcome, my dear.\\
524 - What's that? Another Oscar?\\
525 - I'll have to oblige to this.\\
526 - This is the sixth one.\\
527 - Uh, the twelfth one.\\
528 - A call for me?\\
529 - I'll take it right here on the set.\\
530 - Hello? Oh, hello, Little Ricky,

later.\\
7 - Good-bye.\\
8 - Who was that, honey?\\
9 - Ralph Berger.\\
10 - He fell in love with our car.\\
11 - He wants to buy it.\\
12 - You can't sell the car.\\
13 - How are we gonna get home?\\
14 - I know. I told him to forget it.\\
15 - Oh.\\
16 - Gee, I wonder what happened to Fred.\\
17 - What do you mean?\\
18 - Well, I called him about an hour ago\\
19 - and asked him to go out and buy
something for me\\
20 - and he just disappeared.\\
21 - All he had to do was get a little box
of Q-tips.\\
22 - It shouldn't take him that long.\\
23 - A box of what?\\
24 - Q-tips. You know,\\
25 - these little things I use for the
baby.\\
26 - Oh, oh.\\
27 - You see the new can that I bought?\\
28 - The can of shaving lather I just
bought?\\
29 - No, I didn't see it.\\
30 - Well, it's missing.\\
31 - And another little item is missing,
too.\\
32 - My safety razor.\\
33 - The razor I saw.\\
34 - I took it away from the baby this
morning.\\
35 - There was no Oh.	 blade in it,\\
36 - but do you know that he climbed all
the way up\\
37 - on the sink to get it?\\
38 - Now, what did I do with it?\\
39 - Oh.\\
40 - Certainly, you didn't put it in your
purse.\\
41 - Well, you never can...\\
42 - I think we're closing in on that can
of lather.\\
43 - Oh, get me something to wipe this off
with, honey.\\
44 - Look at this mess.\\
45 - What that kid won't do.\\
46 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
47 - Uh-oh.\\
48 - What's the matter?\\
49 - I found the razor.\\
50 - (chuckling): Oh.\\
51 - How did he ever get that in there?\\
52 - Here, honey.\\
53 - Oh, what that kid doesn't get into.
Honestly.\\
54 - I can't get it out. How did he put it
in there?\\
55 - It's gonna be an interesting way to
shave.\\
56 - (laughing)\\
57 - Oh, dear.\\
58 - Ricky?\\
59 - Little Ricky?\\
60 - I want to see you.\\
61 - Maybe I can shoot my whiskers off.\\
62 - Oh, no!\\
63 - What happened?\\
64 - Let's see what your daddy has to say
about this.\\
65 - Oh, no!\\
66 - Oh, Ricky!\\
67 - It's all over everything in there.\\
68 - Now, you know you shouldn't do that.\\
69 - Let's wash him off.\\
70 - I'll wash him off.\\
71 - Wash him off.\\
72 - Lucy?\\
73 - Oh, Lucy?\\
74 - Here.\\
75 - Well, what's this?\\
76 - Well, you wanted cue tips, didn't
you?\\
77 - Yes.\\
78 - Well, they wouldn't sell me the tips\\
79 - without the cues.\\
80 - Here, I brought you some chalk, too.\\
81 - Fred, I think you flipped your lid.\\
82 - I wanted some of these little things.\\
83 - What?!\\
84 - I'd like to see you shoot pool\\
85 - with a silly, little thing like that.\\
86 - Oh, Fred.\\
87 - Tried to do somebody a favor\\
88 - and this is the thanks you get.\\
89 - Fred, I thought you knew what they
were.\\
90 - I flipped my lid, huh?\\
91 - Oh... heavens.\\
92 - Well... I tried it, but it's
impossible.\\
93 - I'm sorry, honey.\\
94 - I'm going over to Fred and finish
shaving.\\
95 - Okay.\\
96 - And maybe I can... I'll go over to
the studio after that\\
97 - and say good-bye to everybody\\
98 - and then I'll have the car checked.\\
99 - All right, dear.\\
100 - Bye.\\
101 - (door shuts)\\
102 - Oh, gosh.\\
103 - Lucy, what's going on around here?\\
104 - Fred's as mad as a hornet\\
105 - and I just passed Ricky in the hall\\
106 - and he's half dressed and bleeding to
death.\\
107 - What are you doing?\\
108 - I'm just taking some shaving lather
out of my purse.\\
109 - It's a good thing we're gonna go back\\
110 - to New York in a couple of days.\\
111 - This group is cracking up.\\
112 - You can say that again.\\
113 - Hey, Lucy, we're going swimming.\\
114 - You want to come along?\\
115 - No. You go on, I got to get packed.\\
116 - I got twice as much stuff as I had
when we came out here.\\
117 - Oh. Where we gonna eat tonight?\\
118 - Don't you ever think of anything but
food?\\
119 - Ehh.\\
120 - I've got twice as much Ethel as we
had when I come out here.\\
121 - Oh, Fred, leave her alone.\\
122 - (phone ringing)\\
123 - ETHEL: What do you want to start that
for?\\
124 - FRED: Because it's true.\\
125 - Hello.\\
126 - Lucy?
Yeah, Ricky.\\
127 - You're getting big as a barrel.\\
128 - I am not.\\
129 - If Route 66 was downhill,\\
130 - I could roll you back to New York.\\
131 - Oh, I don't think that's very funny.\\
132 - Wait, ju-just a minute, dear.\\
133 - Hey, hey, you two.
Please, just a second.\\
134 - What'd you say, dear?\\
135 - I was saying that I'm at the studio,\\
136 - and I just sold the car.\\
137 - What? How are we gonna get home?\\
138 - On the train.\\
139 - Oh.\\
140 - You know, uh, the fellow I told you
about-- Ralph Berger--\\
141 - he paid me almost as much as I paid
for the car.\\
142 - And not only that, but by using the,
uh, family travel plan,\\
143 - we can make money on the deal.\\
144 - Well, that sounds great.\\
145 - Are you gonna be home the rest of the
afternoon?\\
146 - What?\\
147 - Are you gonna be home?
Yeah.\\
148 - Well, I'm gonna have the tickets sent
over right away.\\
149 - All right, dear. Good-bye.\\
150 - Guess what?\\
151 - Ricky sold the car.\\
152 - Sold the car?\\
153 - What are you talking about?\\
154 - Some fellow at the studio offered him\\
155 - practically what he paid for it, so
he sold it.\\
156 - Isn't that wonderful?\\
157 - Oh, yes, that's wonderful.\\
158 - That's just dandy.\\
159 - Well, you don't sound very pleased.\\
160 - I presume when Ricky sold the car,\\
161 - the back seat went with it?\\
162 - Well, naturally.\\
163 - What are you getting at?\\
164 - Well, we were rather attached to that
seat.\\
165 - That's the way we came out here\\
166 - and that's the way we planned on
going home.\\
167 - Is that what you're upset about?\\
168 - You'd be upset, too, if you just had
your back seat\\
169 - shot out from under you.\\
170 - Oh, Ethel, don't be silly.\\
171 - We're all going home on the train.\\
172 - You're going with us.\\
173 - Who says so?\\
174 - Ricky says so.\\
175 - Quote, we're going home on the train,
unquote.\\
176 - You're part of we.\\
177 - Messenger's on the way over here
right now with the tickets.\\
178 - Yeah, but how many?\\
179 - One for you, one for Ethel, Ricky,
mother and me.\\
180 - Five. The baby doesn't need any.\\
181 - (chuckling): Oh.\\
182 - I guess we were a little hasty,
honey.\\
183 - Good old Ricky wouldn't forget us.\\
184 - Well, of course not.\\
185 - Gee, the train!\\
186 - I haven't been on the train since I
was a little girl.\\
187 - Did they have trains then?\\
188 - Ho-ho.\\
189 - Gee, won't it be fun?\\
190 - You know, they have those new
dome-liner observation cars\\
191 - and diners on that train.\\
192 - You can, oh, see the scenery all the
way back to New York.\\
193 - (knock at door)
Eat and look out at the same time.\\
194 - Yeah?
Mrs. Ricardo?\\
195 - Yes.
Sign here, please.\\
196 - Yes, sir.\\
197 - Thank you.\\
198 - Thank you.\\
199 - Here are the tickets.\\
200 - Uh-huh.\\
201 - One... two... three... four...\\
202 - One, two, three...\\
203 - Hmm.\\
204 - Now, there's just been a mistake.\\
205 - Yes, and we made it.\\
206 - Come on, Fred.\\
207 - Now, Ethel, listen.\\
208 - Don't go away mad.\\
209 - Mad? Whatever gave you the idea we
were mad?\\
210 - Why, we're tickled to death.\\
211 - I think it's so thoughtful of Ricky\\
212 - to pick such a nice place as
California to dump us in!\\
213 - Oh, Ethel.\\
214 - Oh...\\
215 - Hi, honey.\\
216 - What's the matter?
You mad because I'm late?\\
217 - No, I'm not mad because you're late.\\
218 - Well, did I do something?\\
219 - You sure did, buster.\\
220 - What did I did?\\
221 - Just think back over everything you
did this afternoon.\\
222 - Well, I went to the studio.\\
223 - I said good-bye to everybody.\\
224 - I sold the car.\\
225 - The guy that bought the car drove me
home,\\
226 - and... oh, yeah, I bought the train
tickets.\\
227 - How many?\\
228 - Three.\\
229 - Only three?\\
230 - Yeah. The baby doesn't need one.\\
231 - One for your mother, one for you and
one for me.\\
232 - Oh, no.\\
233 - The Mertzes.\\
234 - Oh, yes, the Mertzes.\\
235 - What's the matter with you, Ricky?\\
236 - Well, I don't know.\\
237 - I was busy thinking of that travel
family plan\\
238 - and try to save some money and the
car...\\
239 - They don't know anything about it, do
they?\\
240 - Oh, don't they. They were right here
when the tickets arrived.\\
241 - Oh, dear. Are they mad?\\
242 - Well, let's put it this way:\\
243 - If I were you, I wouldn't walk ahead
of them down a dark alley.\\
244 - Oh, well, now, this changes
everything.\\
245 - You know, using that plan an-and only
three tickets,\\
246 - I made money on the deal, but now...\\
247 - Well, get them over here.\\
248 - We'll figure out something.\\
249 - Well, I should hope so.\\
250 - 317, please.\\
251 - I don't know how could you forget
them.\\
252 - Well, honey, I got so many things on
my mind.\\
253 - The band and the whole thing...\\
254 - Checked out?\\
255 - That's impossible.\\
256 - 317-- Mr. And Mrs. Fred Mertz.\\
257 - Oh, no!\\
258 - She said they checked out.\\
259 - They're down in the garage right now,
she said.\\
260 - What are they doing in the garage?
They don't have a car.\\
261 - Maybe they're stealing ours.\\
262 - We don't have one either.\\
263 - Oh, well, what's the difference? Come
on.\\
264 - All right.\\
265 - Oh, no! 	Oh...\\
266 - Are you stepping on the right thing?\\
267 - Yes, I'm stepping on the right thing.\\
268 - Is that what the man said to step on?\\
269 - Yes, that's what the man said to step
on.\\
270 - You want to get up here and drive
this?\\
271 - No, I just want to get this thing
started.\\
272 - (engine sputtering)\\
273 - What do you think you're doing?\\
274 - Well, what does it look like we're
doing?\\
275 - We're going back to New York.\\
276 - On a motorcycle?\\
277 - Yes, on a motorcycle.\\
278 - Ethel, are you seriously considering\\
279 - going to all the way to New York on a
motorcycle?\\
280 - Well, Fred gave me a choice, and this
beats hitchhiking.\\
281 - Come on, Fred.
Let's go.\\
282 - Now, wait a minute, Ethel.\\
283 - We're all going home together.\\
284 - Ricky said he'd buy the tickets.
Didn't you?\\
285 - Well, we'll figure out something.\\
286 - There, you see...\\
287 - What do you mean, "Figure out
something?"\\
288 - Give her the gas, Fred.\\
289 - (horn tooting)
Get out of the way, Lucy.\\
290 - Go!\\
291 - We can talk about it.\\
292 - Get out of the way.\\
293 - (clamoring)\\
294 - RICKY: Fred! Fred!\\
295 - (crashing)\\
296 - Look out, Fred!\\
297 - (rattling, glass shattering)\\
298 - (horn tooting)\\
299 - (glass breaking)\\
300 - (dull thud)\\
301 - Are you all right?\\
302 - What's the matter?\\
303 - You step on the wrong gear?\\
304 - Yes, I step on the wrong gear.\\
305 - Well, what'd you want to do that for?\\
306 - Well, I thought it might be fun\\
307 - to back all the way to New York\\
308 - so we could see where we've been.\\
309 - Oh, I don't think\\
310 - this is any time to be funny, Fred.\\
311 - All right, all right, Ethel, Ethel,
Ethel,\\
312 - the main thing is, you're all right.\\
313 - That's right, Fred, Ethel.\\
314 - I'm sorry. I'll...
I'll buy the tickets.\\
315 - There. That fixes everything.\\
316 - Oh, Gee, that's great, isn't it Fred?\\
317 - Fred?\\
318 - Ricky is spending.
He will pay.\\
319 - Fred, he said he'd buy the tickets.\\
320 - What more do you want?\\
321 - Who's gonna pay for that motorcycle?!\\
322 - Oh...\\
323 - Well, you certainly don't expect me
to.\\
324 - Oh...	    Why not?\\
325 - If you'd bought tickets in the first
place,\\
326 - I wouldn't have to buy the motorcycle\\
327 - in the second place!\\
328 - (all clamoring)\\
329 - ...you don't even know how to ride!\\
330 - (all talking over each other)\\
331 - Oh!!\\
332 - (knock at door)\\
333 - Come in.\\
334 - Hi.\\
335 - Hi.\\
336 - Where's Ethel?\\
337 - Well, she took the motorcycle down to
have it fixed.\\
338 - Ethel took it down?\\
339 - Well, I'd have taken it, but my
shoulder is killing me.\\
340 - Oh.\\
341 - Besides, she's stronger than I am.\\
342 - Oh, Fred...\\
343 - Well, she is.\\
344 - Hey, would it help if I rubbed your
shoulder a little bit?\\
345 - Yeah, I guess so.\\
346 - How's that?\\
347 - Oh, that feels fine.\\
348 - Fred...
Yeah?\\
349 - I had a long talk with Ricky\\
350 - and he's gonna buy the tickets.\\
351 - After the fight we had last night?\\
352 - After the fight you had last night.\\
353 - Did he say he'd buy 'em?\\
354 - Well, not exactly,\\
355 - but I could tell by the look on his
face.\\
356 - Oh, sure.
No, now, really,\\
357 - I know him.\\
358 - Oh...\\
359 - LUCY: What's the matter, girl?\\
360 - I pushed that piece of junk to three
different places\\
361 - and they can't fix it and they won't
buy it.\\
362 - Wouldn't they give you anything on
it?\\
363 - Yep. I got this on it.\\
364 - A parking ticket?\\
365 - No. It's for "dumping rubbish within
the city limits."\\
366 - Ethel, Ricky's going to buy\\
367 - your train tickets.\\
368 - After the things big mouth said to
him last night?\\
369 - Big mouth?\\
370 - I suppose I started it?\\
371 - Oh, now, Fred.\\
372 - He said he'd buy the tickets.\\
373 - Why didn't you leave well enough
alone?\\
374 - Why should I get stuck for the price
of a motorcycle?\\
375 - Because you smashed it.\\
376 - You'd think anybody would have the
sense\\
377 - to start it off and drive it\\
378 - in the direction it was pointing in.\\
379 - Ethel, please.\\
380 - How did I know it was set in reverse?\\
381 - If you didn't know...\\
382 - All right, all right, all right.\\
383 - Now wait a minute, Ethel, Ethel, Fred
is right.\\
384 - If Ricky bought the tickets in the
first place,\\
385 - there wouldn't have been any
motorcycle.\\
386 - Who asked you?\\
387 - Well, it's just common sense.\\
388 - Common sense has nothing to do with
it.\\
389 - When I say he's wrong, he's wrong.\\
390 - Oh, Ethel.\\
391 - What are you doing over here anyway?\\
392 - Massaging his shoulder.\\
393 - I'll rub it if it needs rubbing.\\
394 - Since when did you and he get to be\\
395 - such good friends--\\
396 - you taking his side and rubbing his
shoulder?\\
397 - Why, Ethel, what's the matter with
you?\\
398 - Oh... we're stuck for the price of a
motorcycle\\
399 - and Ricky won't buy those tickets for
us\\
400 - in a million years.\\
401 - Oh, he will, too.\\
402 - Now, I'll show you how well I know
Ricky.\\
403 - I'll be right back.\\
404 - Is this the place that's sore?!\\
405 - It is now that you've stuck your
claws into it.\\
406 - Here.\\
407 - Now, here's two of our tickets.\\
408 - Now, would I be giving you this\\
409 - if I wasn't sure that Ricky was gonna
get some more?\\
410 - We'd be stuck.\\
411 - Well, that's more like it.\\
412 - Thanks, Lucy.\\
413 - Yeah. 'Course I'm still stuck for the
price...\\
414 - Shut up!\\
415 - Lucy...\\
416 - I'm sorry for what I said.\\
417 - Oh, honey, that's all right.\\
418 - I understand.
You were just upset.\\
419 - That feel good, Fred?\\
420 - Feels fine now.\\
421 - Lucy...\\
422 - Huh?\\
423 - I'll do that.\\
424 - Hi.\\
425 - What's that for?\\
426 - I gambled a lot on the sweetness of
your character today, Ricky.\\
427 - Did you get the tickets for the
Mertzes?\\
428 - Yeah, I got the tickets.\\
429 - Hooray! You're just wonderful as I
thought you were!\\
430 - Well, I don't know what's going on,
but I got the tickets.\\
431 - Good. Now I'll tell you what I did
today.\\
432 - 'Course I couldn't get them
compartments as we have.\\
433 - But, uh, I got them the best thing I
could get, you know--\\
434 - upper berths.\\
435 - Oh, dear.\\
436 - Oh, what... "Oh, dear" about what?\\
437 - You think they'll mind sleeping in an
upper berth?\\
438 - No, but you will.\\
439 - Me? I won't have to.\\
440 - Won't you?\\
441 - No. I have a compartment.\\
442 - Have you?\\
443 - Lucy, are you trying to tell me
something?\\
444 - No, I'm trying to keep from telling
you something.\\
445 - Tell what?\\
446 - Well, the Mertzes said that you
wouldn't buy the tickets.\\
447 - I said you would. We got into a big
fat argument,\\
448 - and... and... oh, dear.\\
449 - And I... I gave them two of our
tickets.\\
450 - What?!\\
451 - Well, I didn't know the difference!\\
452 - They were just tickets.\\
453 - Well, these are just tickets, too.\\
454 - So, you take them over there\\
455 - and get my compartment back.\\
456 - I can't do that.\\
457 - Why not?\\
458 - Well, upper berths...\\
459 - An upper berth is as good as a back
seat.\\
460 - Well, it'll be different if they...\\
461 - if they didn't have the tickets
already,\\
462 - but to say, "Here, take these.
The good ones are for us."\\
463 - I can't do that.
Look, are you gonna do it,\\
464 - or you want me to go over there and
tell them?\\
465 - Well, there must be some other way.\\
466 - All right, I will.
I'll explain it to them.\\
467 - Hi.\\
468 - You get the tickets?\\
469 - Yeah.\\
470 - Ethel...\\
471 - Oh, Ricky, we ought to be ashamed of
ourselves,\\
472 - and we are.\\
473 - How could we ever forget\\
474 - what a wonderful friend we have in
you.\\
475 - Yeah, well, Ethel...\\
476 - And you treat us like this.\\
477 - The way you treat yourself and your
own family.\\
478 - Well, you know the way I feel about
you.\\
479 - Oh, Ricky, there's nothing two-faced
about you.\\
480 - No.\\
481 - Oh, you're just wonderful.\\
482 - You're...\\
483 - you're noble.\\
484 - You know, I was awful upset about
those tickets.\\
485 - Yeah?\\
486 - I didn't think you were gonna get
them.\\
487 - RICKY: Oh.\\
488 - I got so mad, I got mad at Lucy
rubbing Fred's shoulders.\\
489 - (chuckling): Oh.\\
490 - She did.
She was so upset, yeah.\\
491 - (chuckling): Yeah.\\
492 - Lucy, I'm going to the drugstore. You
want anything?\\
493 - No, thanks, dear.\\
494 - Fred's taking a nap,\\
495 - but he'll be in to thank you just as
soon as he wakes up.\\
496 - Lucy...\\
497 - yeah?\\
498 - Can I trust you to stay away from my
husband?\\
499 - (guffawing)\\
500 - Now what are we gonna do?\\
501 - I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.\\
502 - You can all take the tickets.\\
503 - I'll go home on the motorcycle.\\
504 - Oh, Ricky, now, don't be silly.\\
505 - Look, go to the phone, see if they
had a cancellation.\\
506 - I was just there a half an hour ago.\\
507 - Well, lots can happen in 30 minutes.\\
508 - Yeah, I'll tell you something\\
509 - that happened in the last 30 minutes:\\
510 - My stomach is all knotted up.\\
511 - Well, unknot it and go to the phone.\\
512 - Go on.\\
513 - Hello. Give me Union Pacific, please.\\
514 - How do you like that?\\
515 - We're stuck being nobble to the
Mertzes.\\
516 - Well, you're the one who was being
"nobble."\\
517 - Ticket agency, please.\\
518 - Uh, listen, this is Ricky Ricardo.\\
519 - Yes, Mr. Ricardo, uh, what can I do
for you?\\
520 - Oh, have you had any cancellations
for compartments\\
521 - in th-the dome-liner, city of Los
Angeles?\\
522 - Oh, I'm very sorry, Mr. Ricardo.\\
523 - The only thing we have left on that
train are uppers.\\
524 - Yeah, well, that's what I was afraid
of.\\
525 - Thank you very much.\\
526 - If you have any, would you please let
me know?\\
527 - Good-bye.\\
528 - Nothing.\\
529 - Yeah...\\
530 - Hey!\\
531 - I just realized something.\\
532 - Fred put those tickets in his wallet\\
533 - without even looking at them.\\
534 - He doesn't know whether\\
535 - they're riding in a compartment or a
caboose.\\
536 - So?\\
537 - If we could just switch his tickets
for these\\
538 - without his knowing it.\\
539 - What made you think that he hasn't
opened his wallet\\
540 - and looked at the tickets?\\
541 - Fred? Open his wallet?\\
542 - You're right.\\
543 - He hasn't seen the tickets.\\
544 - Now, if we could just think of\\
545 - a sneaky way to make the switch.\\
546 - Well, that's your department.\\
547 - You're vice president in charge of
sneaky switches.\\
548 - That's true.\\
549 - Good luck.\\
550 - (snoring)\\
551 - (snoring)\\
552 - (snorting)\\
553 - (snorting)\\
554 - What are you doing?\\
555 - Uh...\\
556 - What are you doing?\\
557 - Now, Ethel, I can explain.\\
558 - What's going on?\\
559 - What are you doing?\\
560 - What's going on?\\
561 - I, I, uh, I-I got to thinking,\\
562 - it was sort of our fault that...
that Fred's shoulder was hurt,\\
563 - so I came down to massage it for him.\\
564 - Does-does that feel all right, Fred?\\
565 - That feels fine. Thanks.\\
566 - It should. It was the other shoulder
he hurt.\\
567 - Oh, I... I-I thought maybe the pain
traveled over\\
568 - to the sort of a sympathetic travel
over-- no, I guess not.\\
569 - Well, I'm waiting for an answer.\\
570 - What was that question again?\\
571 - What are you doing?\\
572 - Oh, yeah.\\
573 - Uh, well, Ethel, I was...\\
574 - You see, I was just, uh...\\
575 - Not at first, I wasn't.\\
576 - But...\\
577 - there, there's usually...\\
578 - there comes a time, you know, when...\\
579 - you're absolutely right.\\
580 - We'll talk about it on the train.\\
581 - What happened?
You switch the tickets?\\
582 - Not quite.\\
583 - What do you mean, "not quite"?\\
584 - (pounding on door)\\
585 - Who's that?\\
586 - Who's what?\\
587 - ETHEL: Lucy, I want to talk to you!\\
588 - FRED: Lucy!\\
589 - The Mertzes!\\
590 - Don't answer the door.
Maybe they'll go away.\\
591 - What are you talking about?\\
592 - Lucy, I want to know what you were
doing\\
593 - in our room with your arms around
Fred.\\
594 - So do I.\\
595 - Oh, no!\\
596 - Oh, I might as well tell you the
whole ugly story.\\
597 - (Ricky moans)\\
598 - I-I was trying to... change\\
599 - the tickets in Fred's wallet for
these.\\
600 - Is that all?\\
601 - Well, all you had to do was ask.\\
602 - Well, these are uppers.\\
603 - Well, that's okay.\\
604 - Why, sure it is.
Here.\\
605 - Well, gee, thanks, Fred.\\
606 - You're welcome.\\
607 - There you are.
All that trouble for that?\\
608 - That's fine, Fred.\\
609 - Thank you. I'm glad you don't mind.\\
610 - I didn't know...\\
611 - Wait a minute!\\
612 - These tickets are uppers, too.\\
613 - I know it. We didn't need that
expensive compartment,\\
614 - so I traded it off for two uppers.\\
615 - Oh... no!\\
616 - And the difference just paid for the
motorcycle.\\
617 - Asi que de todas maneras\\
618 - yo estoy comprando motocicleta otra
vez.\\
619 - Yeah, I know it.\\
620 - (phone ringing)\\
621 - Hello?\\
622 - Yes! Yes, we'll take it, definitely.
Thank you.\\
623 - They got a cancellation on a
compartment.\\
624 - Oh!	Great!\\
625 - Hey, that must be the compartment\\
626 - that Fred just turned in.\\
627 - Yeah, that's right. That's...\\
628 - How do you like that?\\
629 - I just bought back my own
compartment!\\
630 - Oh, no!\\
631 - Oh, honey!\\

2 - ANNOUNCER: And now, I Love Lucy.\\
3 - (applause)\\
4 - Hurry up!\\
5 - I am hurrying up.
Come on!\\
6 - Oh, look at this.\\
7 - I had no idea a train was nice as...\\
8 - Oh, Mother, look.\\
9 - They got the little beds already made
up.\\
10 - Oh, it's a beautiful train.\\
11 - Come on, I'll take the baby, Micky.\\
12 - All right, Mother... Micky.\\
13 - Oh, come on, darling.\\
14 - All right, I mean, I...
I can't help it.\\
15 - Come on.\\
16 - Phew.\\
17 - Gee, these things are heavy.\\
18 - Why didn't you let the porter carry
them, Fred?\\
19 - I'll give you three guesses.\\
20 - I need the exercise.\\
21 - I'm building up my muscles.\\
22 - You'd get more exercise\\
23 - if you'd try to pry open that
pocketbook of yours.\\
24 - Aah!\\
25 - Oh, gee, I'm really on a train.\\
26 - This is my first train trip, you
know.\\
27 - You're kidding!
No.\\
28 - No. She's never been on a train
before.\\
29 - No, of course, I know all about them.\\
30 - I've seen them in movies and
everything.\\
31 - Which car do the spies usually ride
in?\\
32 - Spies?\\
33 - Yeah. This wouldn't by any chance\\
34 - be the Orient Express, would it?\\
35 - ETHEL: Oh, Lucy.\\
36 - Gee, I can't believe it.\\
37 - I'm taking the city of Los Angeles
home.\\
38 - Is that what you've got in these
bags?\\
39 - Oh, Fred...\\
40 - Just be joyous.
Have fun.\\
41 - Are you gonna be all right with
those, Fred?\\
42 - What do you mean?\\
43 - Look: "Danger. Do not touch.
Emergency brake."\\
44 - Well?\\
45 - Well, don't tell me\\
46 - if there's an emergency,\\
47 - the engineer has to run way back here\\
48 - to stop the train?\\
49 - No, honey.\\
50 - They got one of those in every car.\\
51 - The engineer has his own set of
brakes.\\
52 - Well, I'm awful glad to hear that.\\
53 - Oh, honey, I can't tell you how happy
I am\\
54 - to be going home on a train!\\
55 - I bet Little Ricky's gonna enjoy it.\\
56 - Oh, look, I didn't know they had
little hallways like this.\\
57 - I thought they all, they all had
compartments\\
58 - that opened on the outside.\\
59 - That's only in those foreign movies
you've been seeing.\\
60 - Oh!\\
61 - Well, this is our compartment\\
62 - and Mother must be over here in B.\\
63 - Yeah.\\
64 - Pardon me.\\
65 - Oh, yes, of course.\\
66 - Mother, are you and the baby okay?\\
67 - What's up, porter?\\
68 - How soon do we leave?\\
69 - Right away, sir.\\
70 - You can set your watch by the
domeliner.\\
71 - Oh, well, that's nice.\\
72 - Those go in there, please.\\
73 - LUCY: Oh, isn't this cute!\\
74 - Ricky...
Yeah?\\
75 - There's a little door that connects
the two rooms.\\
76 - It's just like a little apartment.\\
77 - Yeah, they think of everything.\\
78 - Yeah.
Oh.\\
79 - Pardon me, sir.\\
80 - Yeah.
Oh, certainly.\\
81 - Thank you, porter.\\
82 - Thank you, sir.\\
83 - RICKY: Ah, there!
Here they come.\\
84 - Hey, this is great.\\
85 - We're in the car right ahead of you.\\
86 - Yeah?
Oh, yeah?\\
87 - Yeah, we're neighbors.\\
88 - 'Course, we're out of the high-rent
district.\\
89 - Uppers, 12 and 13.\\
90 - Oh, stop complaining.\\
91 - The altitude's good for your sinus.\\
92 - Come on in and sit down.\\
93 - No, no, no, we're headed for the
diner.\\
94 - There's a car right behind.\\
95 - The diner so soon?\\
96 - Guess who's hungry already.\\
97 - The bottomless pit.\\
98 - Oh, now, Fred.\\
99 - I heard they had wonderful food on
this train\\
100 - and I want to get in there before
it's all gone.\\
101 - Now, don't worry.
They'll have plenty.\\
102 - They heard you were coming.\\
103 - Oh, you're so funny.
Let's go.\\
104 - We'll see you later.\\
105 - When we get settled, we'll be up
there.\\
106 - All right.\\
107 - Gee, they have all the luck.\\
108 - Their car is right next to the diner.\\
109 - Well, maybe I can get you an upper\\
110 - right over the stove.\\
111 - Then you can just let down a basket
for your food.\\
112 - If I wasn't so hungry, I'd slug you.\\
113 - Try to amuse him, dear.\\
114 - The crayons are in that little bag,
huh.\\
115 - Ricky?\\
116 - Yeah, honey?\\
117 - Are you hungry?\\
118 - Well...\\
119 - Let's go up and join the Mertzes,
huh?\\
120 - All right.\\
121 - Okay, I-I'll just take for a minute
to fix up.\\
122 - Okay.\\
123 - Oh, Ricky, now, where's my bag?\\
124 - You had it.
Mother, is my bag in there?\\
125 - MRS. McGILLICUDDY: No, no, dear.\\
126 - LUCY: Well, that's funny.\\
127 - I don't see it here anyplace.\\
128 - It's all the stuff the porter brought
in.\\
129 - Are you sure it isn't in there?\\
130 - MRS. McGILLICUDDY: Well, no, dear, it
isn't in here.\\
131 - Ricky, my bag is gone!\\
132 - Now, honey, it can't be gone.\\
133 - It was there a minute ago.\\
134 - My purse is gone!
Now, let's see.\\
135 - I had it when I bought the magazines.\\
136 - It's, uh... it's at the newsstand.\\
137 - The newsstand!
Ricky, go and get it!\\
138 - I can't go and get it.\\
139 - The porter said the train is leaving
right now.\\
140 - Ricky, please, please, go get my
purse.\\
141 - Oh, honey, it's silly.\\
142 - We'll wire them, and they'll send it
ahead.\\
143 - No, Ricky, no! Go!\\
144 - Honey, what can be so wonderful about
that old bag of yours?\\
145 - It's got the train tickets in it!\\
146 - Oh, no!
Yeah!\\
147 - What's the matter with you?!\\
148 - LUCY: Honey, I'm sorry!
Hurry up!\\
149 - Oh, please... Oh, dear.\\
150 - Excuse me, lady.\\
151 - Excuse me, sir.\\
152 - LUCY: Oh, I don't know. I-I-I...\\
153 - Honey...\\
154 - All visitors off, please.\\
155 - Wh-What do you mean?
Why do you say that?\\
156 - Well, the train's about to leave,
ma'am.\\
157 - But it can't leave!
It can't leave!\\
158 - You tell them to hold the train,
porter.\\
159 - Tell them to hold the train!\\
160 - I'm sorry, ma'am.\\
161 - You'll have to speak to the
conductor.\\
162 - (train whistle blowing)\\
163 - We're moving.\\
164 - Hey, you stop the train!\\
165 - You have to stop the train.\\
166 - I'm sorry, madam.
I can't do that.\\
167 - Stop this train!\\
168 - Lady, I-I can't stop this train once
it's started.\\
169 - We have rules, you know.\\
170 - But-but my husband isn't on yet.\\
171 - Please! We left him back at the
station.\\
172 - Well, he can take a cab and pick us
up at Riverside.\\
173 - Riverside?!\\
174 - Oh, no!\\
175 - (hissing)\\
176 - (rumbling and crashing)\\
177 - (glass shattering)\\
178 - Mother, are you all right?\\
179 - Well, we're all right.
What was that?\\
180 - Oh, I-I don't know.\\
181 - The train just made a slight
hesitation.\\
182 - I'll be right back.\\
183 - Lucy!\\
184 - What made the train stop like that?\\
185 - Gosh, what a jolt.\\
186 - I didn't get a bite of my food.\\
187 - What happened?\\
188 - I stopped the train.\\
189 - What?!
Why?\\
190 - Well, Ricky got off to get my purse\\
191 - and they started without him.\\
192 - Oh, that's too bad.\\
193 - Oh, he'll make it.\\
194 - I hope so.\\
195 - Eww! Come on, Fred.\\
196 - Let's go get out of this food\\
197 - and into something more comfortable.\\
198 - Well, I sure hope so.\\
199 - Did you stop this train?\\
200 - Me?\\
201 - You.\\
202 - Well, uh...\\
203 - Madam, did you stop this train\\
204 - by pulling that handle?\\
205 - Well, I didn't do it by dragging my
foot!\\
206 - I told you not to.\\
207 - And I told you that my husband wasn't
on the train yet.\\
208 - Sheesh!\\
209 - In the future, madam, would you allow
me to decide\\
210 - when and where this train shall stop?\\
211 - Gladly.\\
212 - Thank you.\\
213 - Now, if it meets with your approval,\\
214 - I would like to inform the engineer\\
215 - that he may proceed.\\
216 - According to our schedule,\\
217 - we are already several minutes la...\\
218 - Oh, Ricky, you made it!\\
219 - Oh, honey... thank you.\\
220 - Yeah, I made it.\\
221 - What happened? You look like you ran
into something.\\
222 - I did.
What?\\
223 - The back of the train.\\
224 - Honey, why did you do that?\\
225 - I had just gotten your purse\\
226 - when the train started to leave,\\
227 - so I ran after it.\\
228 - I was catching up with it\\
229 - and I was just making a flying leap\\
230 - for the back of the train\\
231 - when it stopped and wham, bang!\\
232 - I ran right into it.\\
233 - (train whistle blowing)\\
234 - Well, nice to have you aboard, dear.\\
235 - Why did they stop the train like that
anyway?\\
236 - Well, maybe there was a cow on the
tracks.\\
237 - A cow in Los Angeles?\\
238 - We haven't gotten out of the city
yet.\\
239 - How can there be a cow?\\
240 - Now, dear, get washed up.\\
241 - It's all right, dear.\\
242 - (train whistle blowing)\\
243 - Mother, are you ready to go and eat?\\
244 - Oh, dear, the baby's so sleepy.\\
245 - We'd better stay here.\\
246 - But will you bring us something?\\
247 - Oh, sure, dear.\\
248 - Here, I'll give you the tickets\\
249 - in case the conductor comes by.\\
250 - I'll bring you a little sandwich or
something.\\
251 - Come on, Ricky.\\
252 - All right, dear.\\
253 - Hi.\\
254 - Hi.
LUCY: Oh, hi.\\
255 - Where you going?\\
256 - To the diner.\\
257 - You gonna eat again?\\
258 - What do you mean, "again?"\\
259 - We didn't get anything to eat.\\
260 - Our food just came when the train
stopped.\\
261 - Oh.\\
262 - I got so many mashed potatoes on my
shirt,\\
263 - Ethel will never have to starch it
again.\\
264 - Come on.\\
265 - All right.
You going, too?\\
266 - Yeah, we're going.\\
267 - Excuse me.
Excuse us.\\
268 - Thank you.\\
269 - May I see your ticket, please?\\
270 - Oh, oh, yes. All right.\\
271 - It's right here.\\
272 - Thank you.\\
273 - Why, I'm very sorry, madam,\\
274 - but you're in the wrong compartment.\\
275 - Well, this says compartment B.\\
276 - Yes, but this calls for compartment B
in 107.\\
277 - This is 108.\\
278 - Oh, but my daughter and her husband\\
279 - are in that compartment.\\
280 - Well, I'm very sorry, lady.\\
281 - I have to go by the tickets.\\
282 - I'll show you to the other
compartment.\\
283 - Oh, oh, dear.\\
284 - Oh, oh, Sam!
Yes?\\
285 - Will you get this luggage?\\
286 - We'll have to move it down to the
next car.\\
287 - Yes, sir.\\
288 - Here we go.\\
289 - Just follow me, please.\\
290 - Okay.\\
291 - Oh, my.\\
292 - Oh, hello, Mr. Estes.\\
293 - Oh, hi.
Nice to have you aboard.\\
294 - Thank you.\\
295 - Your, uh, ticket?\\
296 - Oh, here you are.\\
297 - Thank you.\\
298 - How, uh, how's the jewelry business?\\
299 - Oh, a very successful trip. Very
successful.\\
300 - Why... well, it must be successful\\
301 - if you have to wear that.\\
302 - (chuckling): Oh, I always carry this.\\
303 - Never had occasion to use it, though.\\
304 - Good.\\
305 - Mom.\\
306 - I...\\
307 - Oh, I'm terribly sorry.\\
308 - I must have the wrong car.\\
309 - I'm sorry.\\
310 - I... I'm sorry, sir,\\
311 - but I left my mother and child in
there and I...\\
312 - Why, I'm sorry, madam.\\
313 - There's no one in here but me.\\
314 - Well, ar-are you sure? I know that I
left them in here.\\
315 - You see, we're in compartment A\\
316 - and we have the adjoining
compartments.\\
317 - Ma-Ma-Madam, I'm the only one in
here.\\
318 - Wh-Wh-What have you done to my baby?!\\
319 - Help!\\
320 - Well, madam, I...
Help!\\
321 - Don't you touch me!\\
322 - Don't touch me!\\
323 - Help! Help! Conductor!\\
324 - My mother and child are missing!\\
325 - Help! Help! Help!\\
326 - Help!\\
327 - (hissing)\\
328 - (rumbling and crashing)\\
329 - Oh, no!\\
330 - Never mind that!
Arrest that man!\\
331 - My mother and child are missing!\\
332 - Oh, your mother and child are in the
next car.\\
333 - Oh.\\
334 - What... what car?\\
335 - Why? Why are they in there?\\
336 - Their tickets call for compartment B
but in 107.\\
337 - 107. 107. Oh!\\
338 - Well...\\
339 - I only hope they don't run out of
food\\
340 - before we run out of clothes.\\
341 - Yeah.\\
342 - I have never been so embarrassed in
my whole life.\\
343 - Everybody in the train is talking\\
344 - about the screwy redhead with the
itchy trigger finger.\\
345 - You'd have done the same thing.\\
346 - He's carrying a gun.\\
347 - A lot of people carry guns.\\
348 - You don't.\\
349 - It's a good thing I don't.\\
350 - Oh...\\
351 - Probably a detective.\\
352 - No! No! No!\\
353 - That's a criminal type if I ever saw
one.\\
354 - Close-set beady eyes and a weak chin.\\
355 - Detectives have wide-set eyes\\
356 - and a strong chin.\\
357 - Oh.\\
358 - (brakes hissing)\\
359 - Don't look at me.\\
360 - My hands are clean.\\
361 - Oh, this must be Riverside.\\
362 - Yeah.\\
363 - (knock on door)\\
364 - Yes?\\
365 - Police.\\
366 - Police?\\
367 - What can I do for you, sir?\\
368 - Would you mind showing me your
identification?\\
369 - There you are.\\
370 - Ricky Ricardo!\\
371 - Well, say, my kids have all your
phonograph records.\\
372 - Well, that's nice.
Thank you.\\
373 - I'm sorry to bother you,\\
374 - but we've had a big jewel robbery in
L.A.,\\
375 - and we're checking on all trains,
planes\\
376 - and buses going east.\\
377 - Oh, I see.\\
378 - Well, uh, I hope you catch your
thief.\\
379 - Thank you, Mr. Ricardo.\\
380 - Good night, folks.\\
381 - Good night.\\
382 - Uh, Mr. Detective, sir.\\
383 - Yes, ma'am?\\
384 - Uh, if you're going into the next
compartment, be careful.\\
385 - That man's carrying a gun.\\
386 - Oh? Thank you, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
387 - You're quite welcome, sir.\\
388 - Police.\\
389 - Why don't you mind your own business?\\
390 - I am minding my business as a
citizen.\\
391 - That's terrible.\\
392 - It sure is.\\
393 - I can't hear a thing.\\
394 - Well, we'll hear plenty once the
battle starts.\\
395 - You'd better lie down.\\
396 - Get out of the range of flying
bullets.\\
397 - That's funny.\\
398 - That's funny.\\
399 - He's going off without him.\\
400 - Why couldn't he see that that man is
a criminal?\\
401 - Well, maybe it's because\\
402 - the detectives' eyes are so far apart\\
403 - and his are so close together.\\
404 - How can you make jokes?\\
405 - Aren't you concerned about riding all
the way to New York\\
406 - with a criminal in the next
compartment\\
407 - that's carrying a gun?\\
408 - No. I'm a lot more concerned\\
409 - riding to New York on an empty
stomach.\\
410 - Oh...\\
411 - Come on, I'm hungry.\\
412 - Oh, all right.\\
413 - Let's go.\\
414 - Uh, you go ahead, dear.\\
415 - I want to get my lipstick.\\
416 - I'll be right along.\\
417 - All right.\\
418 - All right, come on in, Miss.\\
419 - I want to talk to you.\\
420 - Uh... uh... some other time.\\
421 - Hey!\\
422 - (screaming)
What's the matter?\\
423 - Ahh!\\
424 - That man in there is a real jewel
thief.\\
425 - I peeked through the door.\\
426 - Oh, no.\\
427 - I peeked through the door and I saw
it.\\
428 - I told you to stay out of it.\\
429 - He's a real jewel thief.
I saw him.\\
430 - Now, listen, honey.\\
431 - I saw a million dollars worth of
diamonds in there, honey!\\
432 - I saw it with my own eyes!	 
You...\\
433 - Listen to me!\\
434 - He's a jewel thief!\\
435 - Would you listen to me?!\\
436 - Now, look, the police have talked to
this man in there.\\
437 - Now it's the police case.\\
438 - As far as you're concerned, this is
finished.\\
439 - This is the end,\\
440 - and I don't want you to talk to
anybody about it.\\
441 - Do you understand?\\
442 - All right.\\
443 - Especially, I don't want you to tell
Ethel about it.\\
444 - Oh, Ethel.\\
445 - I'm glad you reminded me not to tell
Ethel.\\
446 - (train whistle blowing)\\
447 - LUCY: Hi.		  Hi.\\
448 - Hi. How have you been?\\
449 - Oh, wonderful.\\
450 - Gee. Aren't there four seats together
someplace?\\
451 - There's two right down there.\\
452 - You, you and Ricky take those, huh?\\
453 - Ethel and I want to sit and chat.\\
454 - All right.\\
455 - Come on, Rick, let's play some gin
rummy.\\
456 - All right.\\
457 - I'm sending postcards.\\
458 - I should do it.
I should...\\
459 - Hey.
What?\\
460 - Don't forget what I told you.\\
461 - I know, I know.\\
462 - All right.\\
463 - What was that all about?\\
464 - Ricky told me not to tell you
something.\\
465 - Well, you're not gonna\\
466 - let a little thing like that stop
you, are you?\\
467 - Listen, Ethel, if Ricky told me not
to tell you something,\\
468 - I'm certainly not gonna.\\
469 - Good, they're gone.\\
470 - What is it?\\
471 - Do you know why that detective got on
at Riverside?\\
472 - No. I was just dying to ask him. Why?\\
473 - He's looking for a big jewel thief
from Los Angeles.\\
474 - Really?\\
475 - Yes, and I know who it is\\
476 - and what's more, he's aboard this
train.\\
477 - (gasps)\\
478 - Who is he?\\
479 - He's the man in the compartment next
to ours.\\
480 - ETHEL: How do you know that?\\
481 - Well, for one thing, he was carrying
a gun,\\
482 - and when I peeked through the door, I
saw...\\
483 - Lucy, what were you doing peeking
through the door?\\
484 - Do you want to hear this or don't
you?\\
485 - Oh, yes.\\
486 - All right. When I peeked through the
door,\\
487 - I saw a million dollars worth of
diamonds.\\
488 - Are you sure?\\
489 - I have never seen more diamonds
outside of Tiffany's window.\\
490 - I'll bet he's the biggest jewel thief
in the whole world.\\
491 - (gasps)\\
492 - I'll be right back.\\
493 - Where are you going?\\
494 - Oh, I left my opal brooch in my
overnight bag\\
495 - and I want to get it and pin it to
my, uh...\\
496 - I want to pin it.\\
497 - Pardon me, Miss.\\
498 - I couldn't help overhearing.\\
499 - Are you sure of what you saw?\\
500 - Positive.\\
501 - Good work.\\
502 - Special agent.\\
503 - My identification.\\
504 - Oh, I should have known.\\
505 - I can tell you fellows miles away.\\
506 - Now, you say this fellow's in the
compartment\\
507 - right next to yours, huh?\\
508 - Yes, Compartment B, car 108.\\
509 - Close-set, beady eyes and weak chin.\\
510 - That's our man all right.\\
511 - Mm.\\
512 - We'd better not waste any time. Come
on.\\
513 - Me?\\
514 - Well, I need your help\\
515 - in capturing this dangerous criminal.\\
516 - Oh, well, I...\\
517 - Now, look, Miss, I'm not asking you.\\
518 - This is an order.\\
519 - Your government needs you.\\
520 - Yes, sir!\\
521 - He's right in there.\\
522 - What are you gonna do, rush him?\\
523 - No, I don't want any bloodshed.\\
524 - Oh... gee, you fellows are clever.\\
525 - I'll hide,\\
526 - then I want you to get him into this
compartment.\\
527 - I'll have the drop on him.\\
528 - Okay. How am I gonna get him in here?\\
529 - You're a woman, aren't you?\\
530 - Yes.\\
531 - Well?\\
532 - You mean, lure him in?\\
533 - Gee, this will look great in my
memoirs.\\
534 - "I was a woman for the FBI."\\
535 - That's great!
Pretend you're sick.\\
536 - Sick?\\
537 - Sure. Then he'll come in here\\
538 - to help you. Now, go on.\\
539 - All right.
I'll pretend I'm sick.\\
540 - (groaning): Help! Help!\\
541 - Help! Help!\\
542 - (groaning)\\
543 - Help! Help!\\
544 - Help! Help!\\
545 - What's all...\\
546 - (groaning)\\
547 - Oh! Oh, boy, you got him.\\
548 - Oh, look, he's colder than a
mackerel.\\
549 - Good work.\\
550 - Oh, anything for J. Edgar.\\
551 - Oh, look. Let's put the cuffs on him.\\
552 - Come on, let's put the cuffs on him.\\
553 - Let's put the cuffs on him. Hurry up!\\
554 - Oh, boy!\\
555 - Come on, let's put the cuffs on him.\\
556 - You don't need that.
He's unconscious.\\
557 - Oh, boy, let's put the cuffs on...\\
558 - You don't need that.\\
559 - He's unconscious.\\
560 - I know.\\
561 - I made a boo-boo?\\
562 - He's not the man the police are
looking for?\\
563 - No.\\
564 - You?\\
565 - True.\\
566 - Ew!\\
567 - For your sake, I'll keep your secret,
I promise you.\\
568 - I can promise you.\\
569 - Oh, you don't have to promise me
anything.\\
570 - Now, you're the only living person
that can identify me.\\
571 - Oh, yeah, that's right.\\
572 - We're gonna walk out of here\\
573 - and stop between the next two cars.\\
574 - What for?
Never mind!\\
575 - Ah, oh, all right!\\
576 - Now, remember, I got this gun on you.\\
577 - Yeah, I'll remember.\\
578 - All right, come on.
Okay.\\
579 - Come on.\\
580 - Move!\\
581 - Uh, hello!\\
582 - Oh, good evening.\\
583 - I'd like you to meet my...\\
584 - Shake hands with Mr. J... oh!\\
585 - Oh, that must be the crazy redhead\\
586 - everyone is talking about.\\
587 - Now, no more funny business, you
understand?\\
588 - I understand... oh!\\
589 - Hello.\\
590 - Pardon me. Pardon me.\\
591 - I beg your pardon.\\
592 - I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.\\
593 - Excuse me. Excuse me.\\
594 - I'm sorry.\\
595 - (screaming)\\
596 - Excuse me.\\
597 - I'll tell the conductor.
There's a man!\\
598 - (screaming)\\
599 - Lucy!\\
600 - What are you doing?\\
601 - He's the real jewel thief, Ricky.\\
602 - Oh, hon...
He's got a gun!\\
603 - He's got a gun!\\
604 - Put that gun away.\\
605 - (hissing)\\
606 - (rumbling and crashing)\\
607 - (glass shattering)\\
608 - I got him.\\
609 - Goody. I just won five dollars from
the engineer.\\
610 - Never mind that, I got the real jewel
thief!\\
611 - This is the guy.
Grab the jewel case.\\
612 - This is the guy that they were
looking for.\\
613 - LUCY: That's the real jewel thief.\\
614 - And in the compartment back there. I
had no idea...\\
615 - I caught a real jewel thief.\\
616 - That was a real jewel thief that I
caught.\\
617 - It wasn't the man that I thought was
a jewel thief.\\
618 - (muttering): It was another one and I
was...
this one.... back in here\\
619 - and all the time, he was a jewel
thief.\\

145 - Some woman just ripped it right off
my back.\\

156 - (crowd clamoring)\\
157 - Anybody want a souvenir?\\
158 - What's that?\\
159 - Well, it's what's left of Ricky's
sport coat.\\
160 - You mean they pulled it right out of
your hands?\\
161 - Well, not exactly.\\
162 - When I saw which way the wind was
blowing,\\
163 - I capitalized on it.\\
164 - What do you mean?\\
165 - Well, I mean, I grabbed it and tore
it into pieces\\
166 - and sold them for four bits a pop!\\
167 - Why, Fred, you're kidding.\\
168 - When it comes to money, he never
kids.\\
169 - Yeah.\\

181 - Oh...		     (sighing)\\
182 - Well, isn't it wonderful\\
183 - having our own little group together
again?\\
184 - It's so good to have you home, Lucy.\\

you,\\
186 - and I'll bet you're just dying to
hear about our trip.\\
187 - (excited murmur)\\
188 - Well, it was just fabulous.\\
189 - Did Ricky really hobnob with the
stars?\\
190 - Oh, yes, we all hobnobbed.\\
191 - We hobbed with every nob that was
worth hobbing with.\\
192 - It was just fabulous.\\
193 - Right after we checked into our
palatial suite\\
194 - at the Beverly Palms Hotel,\\
195 - we all decided to go out to lunch.\\
196 - So, we all trooped over to the Derby.\\
197 - Oh, you probably know it as the Brown
Derby,\\
198 - but us show folk who eat there all
the time,\\
199 - we just call it the Derby.\\
200 - So as I was saying, we wanted some
lunch,\\
201 - so we went over to the Derby\\
202 - and we sat in a booth.\\
203 - Uh, let's see now,\\
204 - you were on the outside, Fred was in
the middle,\\
205 - I was on this side, and we had...\\
206 - Wasn't Ricky with you?\\
207 - How's that?\\
208 - Wasn't Ricky with you?\\
209 - No, no. As I was saying,\\
210 - we'd only been there about five
minutes when who...\\
211 - Where was Ricky?\\
212 - Wh-What was that, dear?\\
213 - Where was Ricky?\\
214 - Oh, I don't know.\\
215 - He was at MGM, I guess.\\
216 - Oh, MGM!
(all shouting excitedly)\\
217 - Meanwhile...\\
218 - Meanwhile!\\
219 - Meanwhile, in another part of town,\\
220 - we were having lunch at the Derby\\
221 - and, as I was saying,\\
222 - we'd only been there about five
minutes and who...\\
223 - RICKY: Hi, everybody.\\
224 - Ah, here's Ricky!\\
225 - (all clamoring)\\
226 - How was your trip, Ricky?\\
227 - RICKY: Oh, it was wonderful.

it, Mrs. Trumbull.\\
238 - I'll tell you all about all the love
scenes.\\
239 - The funniest thing that happened is,
uh...\\

241 - (all oohing and aahing)\\
242 - Oh, I... I...
I know Bill Holden!\\
243 - I know Bill Holden.
I know, I know...\\
244 - (chattering)\\
245 - Roy, Roy, I knew Bill Holden. I
know...\\
246 - Roy, Roy, I know...
I knew Bill Holden.\\
247 - (chattering)\\
248 - ...dropped this thing on me.\\
249 - And all of a sudden, I looked around,
I said,\\
250 - "Who do you think the waiter was?"\\
251 - Bill Holden!\\
252 - (all shouting excitedly)\\
253 - We were there, too.\\
254 - We have stories to tell.\\

you know, and, uh...\\
263 - Here, this is a Richard Widmark
grapefruit.\\

275 - Is he awake yet?\\
276 - Who?\\
277 - Ricky.\\
278 - We were gonna vacuum the hall, but we
don't want to bother him.\\
279 - Oh, go ahead, vacuum.\\
280 - No, no, no, no, we don't want to wake
him up.\\
281 - Oh, we wouldn't do anything that
would disturb him.\\
282 - What's the matter with you two?\\
283 - I can understand those people last
night,\\
284 - but why are you treating Ricky\\
285 - like he was made of cake or
something?\\
286 - Oh, Lucy, he doesn't belong to us
anymore.\\
287 - He belongs to the world.\\
288 - He's not an ordinary person.\\
289 - He's a great big movie star.\\
290 - Oh, movie star, phooey!\\

309 - I hope so.\\
310 - Well, I'm disappointed in you.\\
311 - Why?	What do you mean?\\
312 - Letting him walk.\\
313 - Aren't you afraid he'll get the soles
of his shoes dirty?\\
314 - I'm surprised you didn't pick him up\\
315 - and carry him all the way downtown.\\
316 - (phone ringing)\\
317 - Really!\\
318 - Well, it's...\\
319 - Well...\\
320 - It's different now.\\

336 - Nancy Graham's coming here this
afternoon\\
337 - to do a column just about me.\\
338 - She's gonna call it "The Lucy Ricardo
Story."\\
339 - Oh, that's great.\\
340 - Yeah, it's about time somebody
realized\\
341 - that I'm important, too.\\
342 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
343 - Mrs. Ricardo?\\
344 - Yes. Won't you come in, please?\\
345 - Thank you.\\
346 - I'm Nancy Graham.\\
347 - Oh, I know.\\
348 - Won't you sit down?\\
349 - Thank you.\\
350 - Care for some tea?\\
351 - No, thank you.\\
352 - I have another interview this
afternoon,\\
353 - so if you don't mind, we'll get right
down to business.\\
354 - Fine. I was born Lucille McGillicuddy\\
355 - in the thriving metropolis of
Jamestown, New York,\\
356 - in 19...\\
357 - Oh... uh...\\
358 - I had a very happy childhood.\\
359 - Uh, I graduated from Jamestown High
School in...\\
360 - Let's say I just graduated four years
after I started.\\
361 - After I left high school,\\
362 - I went to New York City, and...\\
363 - Don't you take notes?\\
364 - Oh.		Yes, I do.\\
365 - Now, tell me, when did you first meet
Ricky Ricardo?\\
366 - Oh, that was years later.\\
367 - After I left high school,\\
368 - I went to New York City...\\
369 - Mrs., Mrs. Ricardo...\\
370 - Mrs. Ricardo...\\
371 - Yes?\\
372 - When did you first meet... him?\\
373 - Himmmm?\\
374 - Well, I thought this was the Lucy
Ricardo story.\\
375 - Oh, it is-- uh, from the time you met
him.\\
376 - Well, I had a very exciting life
before I met him.\\
377 - I'm sure you did, my dear, but you
are only interesting\\
378 - to my readers as you reflect him.\\
379 - Well, I thought you wanted to know
something about her.\\
380 - Mrs. Ricardo, my dear, you obviously
don't know\\
381 - what your husband really means\\
382 - to every one of the 160 million
people\\
383 - in the United States.\\
384 - 80 million of them are women,\\
385 - and they would all love to be in your
shoes.\\
386 - Well, I-I don't understand.\\
387 - Ricky went to Hollywood and made one
picture,\\
388 - came back here, and suddenly the
whole world is all...\\
389 - 80 million of them are women?\\
390 - Yes.\\
391 - And they, and they'd all like to be
in my shoes?\\
392 - That's right.\\
393 - And... I am one of them.\\
394 - Mrs. Ricardo, my dear.\\
395 - What?\\
396 - You have been chosen for a very
important task in life.\\
397 - I have?\\
398 - Why, certainly.\\
399 - It's up to you and you alone\\
400 - to make Ricky Ricardo happy.\\
401 - You must see that his every wish is
fulfilled,\\
402 - that his every waking hour is filled
with happiness\\
403 - due to your love and devotion.\\
404 - Why, Ricky Ricardo is no ordinary
man.\\
405 - He's something special.\\
406 - Give him the attention he deserves.\\
407 - Make him happy!\\
408 - I will! I will!\\
409 - Yours is a sacred trust.\\
410 - Don't worry, I won't goof.\\
411 - Now I must be going.\\
412 - Well, what about your story?\\
413 - I have my story, and to think that\\
414 - it happened right here before my very
eyes--\\
415 - the regeneration of a woman's
character.\\
416 - 80 million heartsick women will rest
easier\\
417 - on their tear-stained pillows\\
418 - when they have read my article\\
419 - "Now I Am His Slave By Lucy Ricardo."\\
420 - (sighing)\\
421 - Good-bye.\\
422 - Good-bye.\\
423 - Hi.\\
424 - A big crowd out in front, so Fred
snuck me through the back.\\
425 - Paper here, honey?\\
426 - Paper? Yes, I'll get it.\\
427 - Oh, you sit down, dear.\\
428 - You sit down.\\
429 - Lucy, is something wrong?\\
430 - Are you sure?\\
431 - Everything's wonderful.\\
432 - Hi!\\
433 - Oh, good morning, Fred.\\
434 - You got any more Ricky souvenirs for
me?\\
435 - No. You picked me clean yesterday.\\
436 - What smells so good?\\
437 - Are you roasting another pig?\\
438 - Yep. Ricky's favorite food,\\
439 - and that's what Ricky's gonna get.\\
440 - Mmm-hmm, that's... what you ought to
give him.\\
441 - (rattling)\\
442 - What are you doing, shining his
shoes?\\
443 - I certainly am.
He likes to be able\\
444 - to see his face in them, and so I
shine them myself.\\
445 - Oh.\\
446 - (whistling)\\
447 - Good morning.\\
448 - Oh, hi, Rick, old pal.\\
449 - Morning, darling.
Good morning.\\
450 - There you are, sweetheart,\\
451 - and there's your orange juice.\\
452 - No seeds.\\
453 - All gone.\\
454 - All... gone.\\
455 - That's it.\\
456 - Here we are.\\
457 - Want to close that, Fred, please?\\
458 - Sure.\\
459 - Here we are, darling.\\
460 - I want you to eat.\\
461 - Here we are.\\
462 - Here we are, sweetheart.\\
463 - You gonna watch the football game on
television today?\\
464 - Well, I... I'd love to, Fred,\\
465 - but I have to go to Tropicana and get
some music.\\
466 - Oh, now, darling, you stay right here\\
467 - and watch that football game.\\
468 - I'll go down and get your music for
you.\\
469 - Oh, honey, Tropicana's way downtown.\\
470 - Now, there's nothing I'd rather do.\\
471 - Now, Lucy...
Now, not another word.\\
472 - I'll go right now, darling.\\
473 - I don't mind at all.\\
474 - Is there anything else I can get you\\
475 - while I'm downtown, dear?\\
476 - No, no, nothing at all, honey.\\
477 - Nothing? All right, sweetheart.\\
478 - Well, I don't get it.
I don't get it at all.\\
479 - Why is everybody treating me\\
480 - like I was a perfect stranger-- even
you.\\
481 - Have I changed?\\
482 - Nope.\\
483 - Then why is everybody treating me\\
484 - like I was something special?\\
485 - Well, I don't know about the rest of
them,\\
486 - but I got a pretty good gimmick going
for me here,\\
487 - and I... I don't want to louse it up.\\
488 - Well, I should have known you had
some kind of an angle.\\
489 - But what about her?\\
490 - She shines my shoes, she answers my
fan mail,\\
491 - sh-sh-she runs all my errands.\\
492 - She follows me around like a, like a
little puppy.\\
493 - She thinks I'm a...\\
494 - She's treating me as if I was a big
movie star.\\
495 - I want to be treated like a husband.\\
496 - What an awful thing to say.\\
497 - Now, look, Fred, I got to snap her
out of it.\\
498 - You got any ideas?\\
499 - Nope. Getting Ethel to stop being
nice to me\\
500 - is a problem I've never had to face.\\
501 - Well, you wouldn't like it any more
than I do.\\
502 - Well, maybe Lucy will get tired of
it.\\
503 - I hope so.\\
504 - Hey, wait a minute.\\
505 - Maybe I can help her get tired of it.\\
506 - What do you mean?\\
507 - Well, she wants to do things for me,
right?\\
508 - Yeah.\\
509 - I'll give her things to do.\\
510 - Mm-hmm.\\
511 - She thinks I'm a big movie star,
right?\\
512 - Mm-hmm.\\
513 - Well, I am going to become the
biggest\\
514 - and most revolting movie star she has
ever seen.\\
515 - Ricky, I got your music, honey!\\
516 - Where are you?\\
517 - Coming!\\
518 - Lucy, where have you been?\\
519 - I have been dying for a cigarette.\\
520 - Oh, uh... I'm sorry, dear.\\
521 - I... I'm sorry I took so long.\\
522 - There you are.\\
523 - Traffic was terrible.\\
524 - Really-- an hour and a half.\\
525 - Well, I'm sorry, dear.\\
526 - My shoes shined?\\
527 - What?\\
528 - Are my shoes shined?\\
529 - Oh, yes.... yes.
I'll get them, dear.\\
530 - Here they are.\\
531 - See?\\
532 - There they are, Mm-hmm.     
sweetheart.\\
533 - I can't be bothered with this music
and lyrics\\
534 - all mixed up together.\\
535 - Type up the lyrics all by themselves,
please.\\
536 - Yes, sir-- I mean, certainly, dear.\\
537 - Thank you.\\
538 - Right now, please.\\
539 - (typing)\\
540 - Lucy?\\
541 - Yes, dear?\\
542 - You didn't shine these shoes, did
you?\\
543 - Oh, yes, I did, dear.
Why? Is something wrong?\\
544 - Well, I can't see my face in it.\\
545 - You can't?\\
546 - Well, I saw mine.\\
547 - Yeah, there I am.\\
548 - See?\\
549 - Is it too much to ask\\
550 - that one's shoes be shined properly?\\
551 - No, dear.\\
552 - No.\\
553 - Gladly.\\
554 - Thank you.\\
555 - The lyrics. Don't forget the lyrics,
please.\\
556 - No.\\
557 - Right now?\\
558 - Yes, please, immediately.\\
559 - How about the shoes, Lucy?\\
560 - I'm waiting for the shoes.\\
561 - Well, honey, I'm typing.\\
562 - Well, you have two hands, haven't
you?\\
563 - Well, yeah, that's true.\\
564 - (phone ringing)\\
565 - (ringing continues)\\
566 - Well?\\
567 - Oh.\\
568 - Hello?\\
569 - (talking in rhythm with typing)\\
570 - Yes, this is the Ricky Ricardo
residence.\\
571 - Yes, I'll hang on.\\
572 - Uh, Lucy?\\
573 - Yes, dear?\\
574 - My cigarette ashes are about to fall
off.\\
575 - Well, honey, there's a...
there's an ashtray right there.\\
576 - (typing)\\
577 - I don't seem to be able to reach it.\\
578 - Well, neither can I.\\
579 - Well, uh, what do you want me to do
with them?\\
580 - I don't care what\\
581 - you do with them!\\
582 - And I don't care\\
583 - whether your shoes are shined or not!\\
584 - And I don't care about your typing!\\
585 - And you can take care of your own
music!\\
586 - Is that so?!\\
587 - Yes, that's so! What do you think of
that?!\\
588 - And I'm not gonna lift a little
finger to help you anymore!\\
589 - You can answer your own phone\\
590 - shine your own shoes, type your own
lyrics,\\
591 - light your own cigarettes and knock
off your own ashes!\\
592 - And if you want another roast pig,\\
593 - you can crawl in the oven yourself,
you big ham!\\
594 - Oh, yeah?\\
595 - Yeah! What do you think of that?!\\
596 - I think it's just great!\\
597 - I don't care what you think.\\
598 - You think it's just great?\\
599 - Yeah! You think\\
600 - I want to be treated like a star,
"dun't" you?\\
601 - Well, "dun't" you?\\
602 - No, I don't.\\
603 - Well, then, what are you doing all
that stuff for?\\
604 - I just wanted to make you mad enough\\
605 - so you'd start fighting back.\\
606 - (crying): Well... oh... Ricky!\\
607 - That... that Nancy Graham said\\
608 - that I should fulfill your every
wish.\\
609 - Well, you been fulfilling my every
wish\\
610 - for 15 years, sweetheart.\\

1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - ANNOUNCER: And now, "I Love Lucy."\\
3 - (applause)\\
4 - (theme song fading out)\\
5 - Hi.\\
6 - Hi.
Hi.\\
7 - Going to go to the movies?\\
8 - Oh, no, thanks, we can't.\\
9 - No, I have a business appointment.\\
10 - Guess what, he signed with Associated
Artists today.\\
11 - Who are they?\\
12 - "Who are they?"\\
13 - Ha! Just the biggest talent agency\\
14 - in the business, that's all.\\
15 - Oh, Rick, that's great.\\
16 - Well, congratulations, Rick.\\
17 - You know, the funny part about that
is,\\
18 - before I went to Hollywood,\\
19 - I couldn't get in the front door of
their office.\\
20 - And since I come back, they came
after me.\\
21 - Well, a trip to Hollywood\\
22 - sort of made celebrities out of all
of us.\\
23 - I'm a very important person\\
24 - since we came home.\\
25 - Really?\\
26 - Yes, sir.\\
27 - Nowadays when I go to the meat market\\
28 - and order hamburger,\\
29 - the butcher grinds it right in front
of my eyes.\\
30 - Yeah, you know, if I wanted to go to
the store\\
31 - without collecting a crowd,\\
32 - I'd have to wear dark glasses and
walk down an alley.\\
33 - Well, that's a lot of trouble, isn't
it?\\
34 - I don't know.\\
35 - I haven't tried it yet.\\
36 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
37 - Hey, that must be Johnny.\\
38 - ETHEL: Oh, we'll duck out.\\
39 - No, stick around.\\
40 - Stick around.
I'd like you to meet him.\\
41 - All right, okay.\\
42 - Johnny, I want you to meet my wife
Lucy.\\
43 - How do you do, Mr. Clark?\\
44 - Hello, Lucy, how are you?\\
45 - These are my friends Fred and Ethel
Mertz.\\
46 - Mrs. Mertz,	    Hello, how are
you?	    Mr. Clark.\\
47 - Mr. Mertz.	Hi, Mr. Clark.\\
48 - I'm sorry I'm late.\\
49 - I was having dinner with Bing,\\
50 - and we had a few problems we had to
iron out.\\
51 - Oh, uh, Mr. Clark, pardon me, but
when you left him,\\
52 - did you shake hands with him?\\
53 - Yes.\\
54 - Ethel, I just shook the hand\\
55 - that shook the hand of Bing Crosby.\\
56 - I shook it, too.\\
57 - Well, I was first.\\
58 - You were a whole hand later.\\
59 - Sit down, Johnny.\\
60 - You must forgive Lucy.\\
61 - She's a little star-struck.\\
62 - Star struck? Well, you'd better get
over that, Lucy,\\
63 - because before long,\\
64 - your husband is going to be one of
the biggest stars\\
65 - this country has ever known.\\
66 - Really?\\
67 - Absolutely.\\
68 - Well, gee.\\
69 - Sit down, John.\\
70 - I saw Dick and Oscar at the Stork
tonight.\\
71 - They're considering you for their new
show.\\
72 - Oh, no kidding.\\
73 - Yeah, and I think I've got you
planted\\
74 - on the Ed Sullivan Show for next
month.\\
75 - No kidding.
Boy.\\
76 - And Ed Warren wants you\\
77 - on his Face To Face TV show.\\
78 - Ed Warren?!
Yeah.\\
79 - You mean, millions of people\\
80 - will be seeing us right here in our
own home?\\
81 - That's right.\\
82 - Oh, gosh!\\
83 - Oh, isn't that wonderful!\\
84 - Honey! Honey!\\
85 - Yeah?\\
86 - We're not on tonight.\\
87 - I'll tell you in plenty of time.\\
88 - Oh, well, that's good,\\
89 - because I want to get new draperies,\\
90 - slipcover all the furniture\\
91 - and we'd better repaint the
apartment.\\
92 - No, that won't be necessary, Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
93 - No, that won't be necessary, Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
94 - Well, I just want everything to look
nice and cheery.\\
95 - Well, it's gonna take more than\\
96 - a coat of paint to make this dump\\
97 - look like anything.\\
98 - Ricky, you can't be seen on Face To
Face\\
99 - in a, in a crummy joint like this.\\
100 - Now, uh, wait a minute now, Johnny.\\
101 - I forgot to mention something about
the Mertzes.\\
102 - Yeah, we own this crummy joint.\\
103 - Well, listen, there's no offense.\\
104 - It's just that we're building Ricky
up\\
105 - as a colorful, exciting, new
personality,\\
106 - and he's got to live like a star
should.\\
107 - You know, in some place like...\\
108 - well, like a Park Avenue apartment.\\
109 - Penthouse even.\\
110 - Here, I, uh, I brought along some
apartment house brochures.\\
111 - Well, look them over.\\
112 - Well, I like it here.\\
113 - So do I.\\
114 - I'll have you know that this is\\
115 - one of the finest apartment buildings
in New York.\\
116 - If not the finest.\\
117 - These walls are solid.\\
118 - Fred.\\
119 - Solid as a rock.\\
120 - They don't build them like this
anymore.\\
121 - No, they haven't built them like this
for a hundred years.\\
122 - Now, just a minute, Johnny.\\
123 - The Mertzes are our best friends\\
124 - and we've lived in this apartment for
15 years\\
125 - and we're gonna stay right here.\\
126 - I didn't mean anything, Ricky,\\
127 - and I'm sorry if I offended anyone.\\
128 - It's just that I'm thinking about
your career.\\
129 - He can have just as big a career
living here\\
130 - as he can in some Park Avenue
penthouse.\\
131 - That's right.
All right, all right.\\
132 - Have it your own way.\\
133 - I'll see if I can't get another angle\\
134 - on that Ed Warren show and call you
in the morning.\\
135 - Okay.
Good night, Lucy.\\
136 - Good night, Mr. Clark.\\
137 - Good-bye.\\
138 - (door shuts)\\
139 - Gee, I'm...
I'm sorry, Fred.\\
140 - Oh, that's all right.\\
141 - This apartment has been insulted by
bigger men than him.\\
142 - Yeah, building inspectors.\\
143 - Imagine us living in a big, fancy
apartment.\\
144 - I like it here.\\
145 - So do I.\\
146 - Don't you worry, Fred.\\
147 - We're never gonna leave this crummy
joint.\\
148 - LUCY: Oh!\\
149 - We're not worried about that.\\
150 - We're going to the movies.\\
151 - We'll run along.
See you tomorrow.\\
152 - Okay, good-bye.
Okay.\\
153 - Don't forget-- tomorrow night we play
bridge, huh?\\
154 - All right, see you later.
We won't.\\
155 - I'm not sure I like your new agent.\\
156 - Oh, honey, he doesn't know any
better.\\
157 - Us in a Park Avenue penthouse.\\
158 - Sheesh!\\
159 - "Four bedrooms, four bathrooms and a
library."\\
160 - What would we do with all that room?\\
161 - Hmm.\\
162 - "Private terrace."\\
163 - Hmm. Well, that would be nice for
little Ricky.\\
164 - "Daily maid service." Whoa.\\
165 - How much do they want for all that
swank?\\
166 - They start at $11,000 a year!\\
167 - For us they end there, too.\\
168 - I'll say.\\
169 - Hoo-hoo.\\
170 - I would kind of like to take a look
at one\\
171 - just to see what it's like inside,
you know?\\
172 - Just forget it.\\
173 - Yeah.\\
174 - Hi, honey.\\
175 - Well, hi.
Where have you been?\\
176 - It's after 8:00.\\
177 - I know. I'm sorry.\\
178 - Rehearsing a new show, you know,
takes a lot of time.\\
179 - Yeah. You have any dinner?\\
180 - Yeah, I had a bite at the club.\\
181 - Hey, guess what I did today?\\
182 - What?\\
183 - I looked at one of those Park Avenue
penthouses.\\
184 - I just wanted to see what it looked
like.\\
185 - It was a $11,000 humdinger.\\
186 - Boy, you should have seen it.\\
187 - A tremendous living room, view of
Central Park\\
188 - and the softest carpet.\\
189 - They were this thick.\\
190 - I didn't see my feet for half an
hour.\\
191 - Made this place look like the city
dump.\\
192 - Now, Lucy...\\
193 - Relax. I found out a terrible thing.\\
194 - It wasn't comfortable over there.\\
195 - I guess I'm the city-dump type.\\
196 - Well, my pocketbook thanks you.\\
197 - I must have looked like the city-dump
type, too.\\
198 - Mrs. Skyler-- she's the manager over
there--\\
199 - she wasn't even gonna show me the
place\\
200 - until I told her who you were.\\
201 - (wry chuckle)\\
202 - I'll tell Fred and Ethel you're here.\\
203 - Okay, I'll clean up.\\
204 - I'll be right out.\\
205 - Okay, fine.
We'll be right over.\\
206 - Ricky's home.\\
207 - Let's go over and play some bridge.\\
208 - Well, come on, what's the matter with
you?\\
209 - Oh, I was just thinking about last
night\\
210 - and how Lucy and Ricky told his agent\\
211 - they'd never move out of here.\\
212 - They're such wonderful people.\\
213 - Yeah, you're right.\\
214 - They really are.\\
215 - They're the kind of people\\
216 - that give people a good name.\\
217 - They're the best friends we ever had.\\
218 - That's for sure.\\
219 - We got to get them out of here.\\
220 - Yep, we got to...\\
221 - What?!\\
222 - We got to make them move out of here.\\
223 - And lose perfectly good tenants?\\
224 - Oh, now, Fred, for once, will you
think with your heart\\
225 - instead of your wallet?\\
226 - I don't know what you're talking
about.\\
227 - They don't want to move.\\
228 - Sure they do, and they should,\\
229 - but they don't want to hurt our
feelings.\\
230 - We can't let friendship stand in the
way of Ricky's career.\\
231 - He doesn't belong in a place like
this.\\
232 - He belongs in a big, beautiful,
wonderful apartment.\\
233 - You know, you're right,\\
234 - but how are we gonna get them to
move?\\
235 - Well, we'll have to be subtle about
it\\
236 - so they won't catch on.\\
237 - Yeah. We can burn the building down.\\
238 - Fred, are you crazy?\\
239 - No, I'm insured.\\
240 - Oh, Fred.\\
241 - Now, let's see.\\
242 - How does a landlord get a tenant to
move out?\\
243 - Well, suppose we give them a lot of
bad service--\\
244 - no heat, no repairs.\\
245 - Think that'll work?\\
246 - It hasn't for 15 years.\\
247 - No, we got to think of something
else.\\
248 - How about, uh...\\
249 - Well, we could pick a fight.\\
250 - What, what about?\\
251 - Well, we could pick one about, um,
about the bridge game.\\
252 - You know how sensitive Lucy is about
her bridge playing.\\
253 - Good. Come on.\\
254 - Now, Fred, Fred, don't weaken.\\
255 - Remember, it's all for friendship.\\
256 - Okay, come on.\\
257 - What's keeping them?\\
258 - (knock at door)\\
259 - Whoa, since when do you knock?\\
260 - Hi. Sorry I was late.\\
261 - Come on, let's get going.\\
262 - Hurry up. Sit down.\\
263 - Come on, sit down.\\
264 - Come on.\\
265 - No, we just came over to tell you\\
266 - not to count on us for bridge.\\
267 - Uh, yes, uh, we've made other plans.\\
268 - Well, how come? You know this is our
regular bridge night.\\
269 - Well, maybe it's time for a change.\\
270 - What do you mean?\\
271 - Well, I guess you'd better come right
out\\
272 - and tell them the truth.\\
273 - The fact of the matter is,\\
274 - we don't want to play bridge with you
anymore.\\
275 - What?!\\
276 - Why not?\\
277 - Well, to put it as charitably as
possible\\
278 - and not wanting to hurt anyone's
feelings,\\
279 - you are lousy bridge players.\\
280 - Now, just a minute!\\
281 - Oh, now, Ricky, you're not so bad,\\
282 - but there's some excuse for you:\\
283 - You learned how to play in Cuba.\\
284 - But Lucy-- whee!\\
285 - She may bring back mah-jongg.\\
286 - Look who's talking--\\
287 - the queen of the ace trumpers!\\
288 - Well, if you want to get nasty about
it,\\
289 - I thought we knew each other well
enough to be honest.\\
290 - Oh, well, if you want to get honest,
let's go.\\
291 - I've got plenty of ammunition.\\
292 - You are possibly one of the worst...\\
293 - Now, just-just wait-wait-wait,\\
294 - wait-wait a minute, wait a minute.\\
295 - Why don't you put your money where
your big mouth is?\\
296 - Why don't you stay and play for
money?\\
297 - Real money.\\
298 - Ha! Fred play for money?\\
299 - I'm not the cheapskate in this group.\\
300 - Meaning I...?\\
301 - Meaning you!\\
302 - You're tighter than the skin on your
congo drum.\\
303 - Now, now, now, now, don't bug your
eyes out at me.\\
304 - Save that for your movie fans if you
have any.\\
305 - (shrieking)\\
306 - This is the thanks we get for
sticking it out\\
307 - for 15 long years in this
termite-ridden deep freeze.\\
308 - If you don't like it here, nobody is
twisting your arm.\\
309 - Yeah, go ahead.\\
310 - Go ahead and what?\\
311 - Go ahead and move out.\\
312 - Well, that's all we had to hear.\\
313 - That's just what we're going to do!\\
314 - Good riddance.\\
315 - And the sooner the better.\\
316 - Don't worry, we're getting out of
this tenement\\
317 - before it's condemned by the Board of
Health.\\
318 - Good, and you can't make it soon
enough for us.\\
319 - That's right!\\
320 - Ha!\\
321 - Ha!\\
322 - Oh! I'm going to start packing right
this minute.\\
323 - Oh, no, you're not.\\
324 - Why not?\\
325 - Those two crazy, wonderful people.\\
326 - What are you talking...?\\
327 - What-what-what, what's...
You deserting to the enemy?\\
328 - No, honey. Don't you see?\\
329 - They were acting like that because
they love us.\\
330 - Well, I'd hate to think how they'd
act\\
331 - if they couldn't stand us.\\
332 - Now, honey, they think that if I stay
here,\\
333 - it's going to ruin my career.\\
334 - Oh.\\
335 - Sure. So they, they, they acted like
that\\
336 - so we'd pick a fight\\
337 - and move to one of those fancy
apartments\\
338 - that my agent was talking about.\\
339 - Oh, Ricky, you're right.\\
340 - When did you catch on?\\
341 - Listen, any time that Fred Mertz\\
342 - tells one of his steady-paying
tenants\\
343 - to move out, there's something fishy
somewhere.\\
344 - Oh, Ricky, they're so...\\
345 - Oh, I could just cry.\\
346 - Boy, I'll bet they'll move out
tomorrow.\\
347 - Tomorrow? They may even go tonight.\\
348 - Yeah, they might.\\
349 - Did you see Lucy's face when I told
her\\
350 - what a horrible bridge player she
was?\\
351 - Did you hear Ricky when I told him\\
352 - what a cheapskate he is?\\
353 - (laughing): Yeah.\\
354 - (crying): Oh, I miss them already!\\
355 - Yeah, me, too.\\
356 - Now... now we'll have to get somebody
else\\
357 - to play bridge with us.\\
358 - Yeah, and the way we play, that's not
gonna be easy.\\
359 - No, it's not.\\
360 - What's your Aunt Martha's phone
number?\\
361 - Gramercy 3-8-0-9-8.\\
362 - (sobbing)\\
363 - What are you calling Aunt Martha for?\\
364 - Well, she always wanted to rent an
apartment\\
365 - in our building, and I thought\\
366 - we might let them have the Ricardos'
apartment.\\
367 - Fred, how can you think of money at a
time like this?!\\
368 - In my sorrow, do I know what I'm
doing?\\
369 - Hello?\\
370 - I'll take it.\\
371 - Hello, Aunt Martha?\\
372 - This is little Ethel.\\
373 - Listen, do you and Uncle Elmo still
want an apartment\\
374 - in our building?\\
375 - I think we're going to have a
vacancy.\\
376 - The Ricardos.\\
377 - Well, they haven't told us the exact
date,\\
378 - but I could let you know.\\
379 - Oh, that's nice.\\
380 - Okay, I'll call you, Aunt Martha.\\
381 - Bye.\\
382 - She'll take it.\\
383 - That's fine.\\
384 - I miss Lucy already!\\
385 - Oh, now, honeybunch, don't start
crying.\\
386 - She's the best friend I ever had.\\
387 - Now, come on, honey, snap out of it.
Come on.\\
388 - Oh, I can't help it.\\
389 - That's the nicest thing anybody ever
did for anybody.\\
390 - I know, I know. Look, we'll just go
over there\\
391 - and we'll tell them that we
appreciate\\
392 - what they're trying to do,\\
393 - but that we're not going to move.\\
394 - Oh, honey, we can't do that.\\
395 - They mustn't know that we know what
they're trying to do.\\
396 - I guess you're right.\\
397 - Well, I'll tell you what.\\
398 - Look, I'll, I'll apologize for
starting the fight.\\
399 - I'll tell them it's all my fault.\\
400 - Well, all right, and I'll tell them\\
401 - that I'm gonna start taking bridge
lessons.\\
402 - Hey, that's good.\\
403 - Okay.	  Come on, let's go.\\
404 - (phone ringing)\\
405 - (sniffling)\\
406 - Hello?\\
407 - Oh, yes. How are you?\\
408 - It's Ethel's Aunt Martha.\\
409 - Oh, uh...\\
410 - Well, just a minute.\\
411 - How tall are you?\\
412 - 5' 11?". Why?\\
413 - 5' 11?". Why?\\
414 - Well, yes, he fits in it.\\
415 - Fits in what?\\
416 - Oh?\\
417 - Oh.\\
418 - Well, uh, we don't know the exact
date,\\
419 - but it's gonna be much sooner than
they expected.\\
420 - Yes. Well, we'll let you know.\\
421 - All right. Good-bye.\\
422 - How do you like that?!\\
423 - What?\\
424 - Aunt Martha wanted to know how tall
you were\\
425 - so she could tell if Uncle Elmo would
fit into our bathtub.\\
426 - Huh?\\
427 - The Mertzes have already rented this
apartment to them.\\
428 - Well, I'll be darned.\\
429 - They knew what they were doing right
along.\\
430 - They had already rented this place!\\
431 - How do you like that?\\
432 - Iy mira que creyendo lo que fuera
mejor amigo mio!\\
433 - Yeah.\\
434 - Oh, come on, Ethel, snap out of it.\\
435 - We did what we had to do and that's
that.\\
436 - (ringing)\\
437 - Hello.\\
438 - Yes, this is Mrs. Mertz.\\
439 - Mrs. Skyler?\\
440 - Uh, yes, the Ricardos have lived in
our building for 15 years.\\
441 - Yes, they've been very good tenants.\\
442 - Oh, she did?!\\
443 - Oh, it is?\\
444 - Yes.\\
445 - Yes, I can recommend them very
highly.\\
446 - You're welcome.\\
447 - Well!\\
448 - Who was that?\\
449 - That was a Mrs. Skyler,\\
450 - the manager of a Park Avenue
apartment building.\\
451 - What did she want?\\
452 - Lucy was over there today looking at
an apartment.\\
453 - What?!\\
454 - Oh, boy they planned to move out all
the time.\\
455 - They just pretended they didn't want
to leave here.\\
456 - Those dirty double-crossers.\\
457 - I ought to go right over there\\
458 - and blacken one of those bugged-out
eyes of Ricky's.\\
459 - Let's go over there tell them what we
really think of them.\\
460 - Come on.\\
461 - Hi.\\
462 - That agent.\\
463 - Say, I'm glad I bumped into you two.\\
464 - I was just on my way over to the
Ricardos'.\\
465 - Ed Warren says it's fine to do the
show from here.\\
466 - From this crummy joint?\\
467 - Well, now, please, I apologize for
that.\\
468 - Now, we have a new angle.\\
469 - Instead of Ricky living in a fancy
apartment,\\
470 - we're gonna show how success hasn't
changed him--\\
471 - how even though he's a big star,\\
472 - he refuses to move\\
473 - from his simple and comfortable, old
apartment--\\
474 - and his two best friends, the
Mertzes.\\
475 - You're both gonna be on the show with
him.\\
476 - That's all very interesting.\\
477 - It's at 8:00 tomorrow night.\\
478 - The only reason we got on is 'cause
somebody canceled.\\
479 - Well, thank you very much, Mr. Clark,\\
480 - but I wouldn't be on a show with
them.\\
481 - Now just a minute, Ethel.\\
482 - You tell the Ricardos we'll do it.\\
483 - Okay.\\
484 - Fred, what's the matter with you?\\
485 - What's the matter with you?\\
486 - How many chances do we get to be on
Face to Face?\\
487 - Besides, who am I to deny 50 million
people\\
488 - the opportunity of seeing Fred Mertz?\\
489 - And his wife.\\
490 - Well...\\
491 - And what about the advertising\\
492 - for the building?\\
493 - I bet we could get double rentals\\
494 - for every apartment in the house.\\
495 - Fred, I'll say this for you: You
never hold a grudge.\\
496 - Thanks.\\
497 - If there's money involved.\\
498 - Nothing doing, Johnny.\\
499 - We just don't want to do a television
show\\
500 - with the Mertzes.\\
501 - But, Ricky...\\
502 - Look, if they want to go on
television,\\
503 - let them go on with Aunt Martha and
Uncle Elmo.\\
504 - Yeah.\\
505 - Aunt Martha and Uncle Elmo?\\
506 - What's that, a kid's show or
something?\\
507 - Never mind.\\
508 - We just don't want to do a television
show with them.\\
509 - But it's all set.\\
510 - Ed Warren expects them on the show.\\
511 - You've got to do it with them.\\
512 - I don't got to do nothing!\\
513 - Now, listen, Ricky, I've got a lot of
important people\\
514 - out there tomorrow night watching
you.\\
515 - Dick and Oscar-- they want to hear
you sing.\\
516 - Ed Sullivan.\\
517 - Well...\\
518 - Look, honey, if it's important to
your career,\\
519 - I guess we can stomach the Mertzes
for half an hour.\\
520 - After all, we never have to see them
again\\
521 - once the show is over.\\
522 - I guess you're right.\\
523 - Good. Then it's all settled.\\
524 - I'll see you tomorrow night, Rick.\\
525 - All right.\\
526 - That a boy.\\
527 - Now, don't be nervous, Ricky.\\
528 - Just-just pretend like it's just any
other night\\
529 - in your living room.\\
530 - Well, hold on.\\
531 - Hey, these, these chocolates, they
look terrible.\\
532 - I think the light is melting them.\\
533 - I'd better go change them, huh?\\
534 - No, no, no. We don't have time.\\
535 - Nobody will see them.\\
536 - I'd better get out of here.\\
537 - I'll go over to the Mertzes\\
538 - and watch it on their TV set.\\
539 - Okay.\\
540 - Did you call us?\\
541 - No. It isn't time.\\
542 - Get back. Get back.\\
543 - Good luck, kids.
Good luck.\\
544 - Are you nervous?\\
545 - No.\\
546 - 20 seconds.\\
547 - Oh. Hello, Ed.\\
548 - Honey, we're not on yet.\\
549 - I know.
I'm just rehearsing.\\
550 - Oh.
Oh... oh, hi, Ed.\\
551 - Mm.\\

happened\\
581 - in the past few months.\\
582 - How did you find Hollywood?\\
583 - Huh?\\
584 - I say, how did you find Hollywood?\\
585 - Oh, Hollywood was wonderful.\\
586 - It was really great.\\
587 - You know, I... I'd been working in...
in nightclubs, you know,\\
588 - for the past few years.\\
589 - It was different, you know, working
without an audience.\\
590 - Uh, Ricky, do you like working to an
audience better?\\
591 - Well, I don't know if I like it
better or not.\\
592 - It's just that it's different, you
know,\\
593 - and then, of course, when you...\\
594 - when you go to the preview and... and
there it is,\\
595 - and there's nothing you can do about
it, you know?\\
596 - I imagine... I imagine that that
preview was pretty exciting\\
597 - for everybody concerned.\\
598 - How about that, Mrs. Ricardo?\\
599 - (mumbling)\\
600 - What?\\
601 - (mumbling)\\
602 - I-I say...
I say, the preview\\
603 - must have been pretty exciting for
everybody.\\
604 - (mumbling)\\
605 - Yes, it was very exciting, Ed.\\
606 - We can hardly wait for...\\
607 - (mumbling): ...going to a preview.\\
608 - We're very excited\\
609 - and we can hardly wait for the
picture to open.\\
610 - Neither can I.\\
611 - Ricky, I understand that-that you
have an unusual situation\\
612 - in that you are best friends with
your landlords.\\
613 - Oh, yes. Fred and Ethel Mertz.\\
614 - They're our very best friends.\\
615 - Would you like to meet them?\\
616 - Yes, Ricky, I would.\\
617 - All right.\\

627 - ain't this something?\\
628 - He's not used to these things.\\
629 - Ricky.\\
630 - Yes?\\
631 - I hope you won't mind my telling
this,\\
632 - but I understand from your agent\\
633 - that he wanted you to move into a
swanky penthouse,\\
634 - but you refused.\\
635 - Oh, yes.\\
636 - Yes.\\
637 - We've lived here for 15 years\\
638 - and we wouldn't move for anything in
the world.\\
639 - (coughing)\\
640 - Anything wrong, Ethel?\\
641 - I found that hard to swallow.\\
642 - Well, Fred, Fred\\
643 - Ricky's attitude must make you very
happy.\\
644 - It certainly does,\\
645 - and we hope they never leave.\\
646 - That's wonderful.\\
647 - He'd be a fool if he did.\\
648 - He's getting reasonable rent and a
wonderful apartment\\
649 - and plenty of service and-- oh, by
the way,\\
650 - if any of you folks out there\\
651 - need a good apartment, just give me a
ring.\\
652 - Ricky... Ricky...\\
653 - Yes, Ed?\\
654 - How about a song?\\
655 - Oh, I'd like...
Sure, very happy to.\\

flag-bearer again.\\

69 - to be flag-bearer again with that
pot.\\
70 - The last time they marched down Fifth

72 - Aah! Can't you get out of it, Rick?\\

79 - that they had to get a show together?\\
80 - ETHEL: Lucy, you were way out in
Little Ricky's room.\\
81 - How did you hear him say that?\\
82 - Listen, when it comes to hearing
about show business,\\
83 - Lucy has a special sense--\\
84 - something that the Navy later
developed and called radar.\\
85 - Oh... How about it, Fred, you need
some talent\\
86 - in the show, huh?
Can I be in it?\\
87 - Now, wait, wait a minute.
Can I...?\\
88 - Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, will you?\\
89 - Let me get comfortable.
I'm going to enjoy\\
90 - watching this happening to somebody
else.\\
91 - Go on.
Oh...!\\
92 - Go ahead!\\
93 - Can I, Fred, Can I be\\
94 - in the show, please?
(cackling)\\
95 - Will you be quiet now!\\
96 - Fred, look, I know there's something
I could do\\
97 - for the lodge show, I know there is.
Can I be in it, can I?\\
98 - Okay, Lucy, I'll take you.\\
99 - Oh, Fred, thank you!\\
100 - Mmm... Thank you!\\
101 - Now, that's the kind of appreciation
I like.\\

104 - Yep.\\
105 - Oh, Fred, thank yo...\\
106 - What kind of show did you have in
mind?\\
107 - Well, I don't know.
It's for my lodge brothers.\\
108 - I know just exactly the kind of show\\
109 - that your lodge brothers would like
to see.\\
110 - So do I, but you can't do that kind
of a show.\\
111 - What's the matter with an operetta?\\
112 - Oh, an operetta!
And I could sing.\\
113 - The one we did at the women's club.\\
114 - The one we did at the club.\\
115 - "Lily of the Valley."\\
116 - La da dee la\\
117 - Of the valley...
Wouldn't that be fun?\\
118 - Yeah, wouldn't it be fun?\\
119 - La da dee la...
Are you kidding?\\
120 - They'll throw you out of that place\\
121 - if they do a show like that.\\
122 - Lucy...\\
123 - I got it. I got my act for Fred's
lodge show.\\
124 - It's just the gypsy in my soul.\\
125 - Well, just forget it.\\
126 - Fred's got What?       another idea.\\
127 - He just called. He'll be here any
minute.\\
128 - What are we gonna do now?\\
129 - He didn't say.\\
130 - He's out having lunch with some old
crony of his again.\\
131 - Another old crony?
Where does he dig 'em up?\\
132 - I don't know.\\
133 - I think somebody put Fred on the old
crony mailing list.\\
134 - (guffawing)\\
135 - Hi, kids.\\
136 - Oh, hi.
Hi, Fred.\\
137 - Well, our troubles are over.\\

144 - Glad to know you, Mrs. Mertz.\\
145 - I'm Mrs. Mertz.\\
146 - Oh, excuse me.\\
147 - Well, the heifer part still goes.\\
148 - Now, Fred.\\
149 - Honey, I'm just kidding.\\
150 - Yeah, he's quite a kidder.\\
151 - Yeah. Sit down, everybody. Sit down.\\
152 - You say you got a new idea for the
show, huh, Fred?\\
153 - Yeah. Well, uh, Rattlesnake is in
town to see the rodeo\\
154 - at Madison Square Garden.
Uh-huh.\\
155 - His kid brother's in the show.\\
156 - Is that so?
Oh, that's nice.\\
157 - He's going to help us put together\\
158 - a Western show for my lodge.\\
159 - A Western show!
A Western show!     Yeah.\\
160 - Well, that's great, ain't it,
partner?\\
161 - You said it, Red.\\
162 - Yeah, boy.\\
163 - Well, we gotta get going.\\
164 - We ain't got much time here.\\
165 - Let me see what kind of talent we got
around here.\\
166 - Say, Fred, uh, can you and your
missus,\\
167 - can y'all do a Western number?\\
168 - Oh, I'll say we can.\\

179 - Oh, send me...
Wait, wait.\\
180 - What's the matter?\\
181 - That's a Western song,\\
182 - and y'all are doing it Eastern.\\
183 - FRED: What do you mean?\\
184 - ETHEL: What's the difference?\\
185 - Western music, you gotta take your
time.\\
186 - Now, you was rushing through that
song\\
187 - like your britches was on fire.\\
188 - Well, we can sing it slower.\\
189 - Yeah, we'll slow it up.\\
190 - Yeah, you gotta slow it up a little
bit.\\
191 - You know what you gotta do?\\
192 - You gotta take your time on it\\
193 - and you really gotta make it sound

199 - "Bend them notes," what do you mean?\\
200 - Bend 'em, just bend...
When I move my hand\\

217 - Now, little lady...\\
218 - What you aiming to do?\\
219 - I'm aiming to do anything you aim at
me.\\
220 - Well, what we need, we need a pretty
girl\\
221 - that can sing a song and yodel.\\
222 - Well, then you can just stop looking.\\
223 - Oh, Lucy, you can't yodel.\\
224 - Well, if you're gonna be technical,\\
225 - she can't sing either.\\
226 - You just pay them no never mind,
Rattle.\\
227 - They don't know everything about me.\\
228 - All right, then give me a little
touch\\
229 - of yodeling and singing, then.\\
230 - All right, um...\\
231 - Ah, ah, oh, oh, oh\\
232 - Oh... oh....\\
233 - (singing off-key): Give me a home\\
234 - Where the buffalo roam\\
235 - And the deer and the antelope play\\
236 - Yodel, yodel, yodel\\
237 - And seldom is heard\\
238 - A discouraging word\\
239 - (whistling)\\
240 - And the skies...\\
241 - What's the matter?\\
242 - You're about to hear\\
243 - your first discouraging word.\\
244 - Well, now, I know my yodeling's a
little rusty\\
245 - but how about my singing?\\
246 - You're about to hear\\
247 - your second discouraging word.\\
248 - Oh...\\
249 - Wait a minute.\\
250 - Now, there must be something we can
do with that voice.\\
251 - Well, I can make a few suggestions.\\
252 - Now, Fred!\\
253 - Now, listen, little lady,\\
254 - all you got to remember that us
Western folks,\\
255 - we always sing through our noses
right here.\\
256 - Oh, you do?\\
257 - Yep. It keeps the prairie dust out
our lungs.\\
258 - Oh, is that right?\\
259 - Now, this time, give it to me\\
260 - and really whine it out.\\
261 - Okay.\\
262 - I will. 	Whine it.\\
263 - Mm. Yeah. Oh...\\
264 - (singing through nose :)
Oh, give me a home\\
265 - Where the buffalo roam\\
266 - And the deer and the antelope play\\
267 - Yodel, yodel, yodel...\\
268 - How's that?\\
269 - Can you spin a rope?\\
270 - No.\\
271 - Well, can you play a fiddle or-or-or
a steel guitar?\\
272 - No.\\
273 - I don't know, little lady.\\
274 - You just don't seem to be the
Western-type entertainer.\\
275 - Oh, I'm not the Eastern-type
entertainer either.\\
276 - I'm just an all-American flop.\\
277 - Aw, now, honey.\\
278 - You gotta to think up something for
her to do,\\
279 - 'cause Fred promised her she could be
in the show.\\
280 - Yes, I did.\\
281 - Well, I got it.\\
282 - Say, I know an act you can do.\\
283 - What is it?
I'll do anything.\\
284 - All you got to know is your right
hand from your left.\\
285 - My right hand from my left.\\
286 - Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.\\
287 - I know. I know.\\
288 - (muttering)\\
289 - Ah. This is my left hand!\\
290 - Good girl!\\
291 - The idea of this act--\\
292 - to make tune on bells.\\
293 - Like a Swiss bell ringer.\\
294 - No, like a Western bell ringer.\\
295 - Oh.\\
296 - Now, you take these bells\\
297 - Yeah.\\
298 - and you tie 'em all over you.\\
299 - All over you?\\
300 - Yeah, and then you start jingling a
little tune.\\
301 - Uh-huh.\\
302 - Yeeng...\\
303 - Yeeng, yeeng, re-reeng...\\
304 - We-re-weeng...\\
305 - Oh, she can do that.\\
306 - I'll be able to do that.\\
307 - All you gotta do\\
308 - is to play the right note with the
bell.\\
309 - Yeah, I'll be able to do that.\\
310 - ...mill stream\\
311 - Where I first... met... you\\
312 - Down by the\\
313 - Old... mill...\\
314 - Stream\\
315 - Where... I... first...\\
316 - Met...\\
317 - You...\\
318 - Down by the old...\\

320 - Oh, hi, dear.\\
321 - Hi, sweetie.\\
322 - Dinner ready?\\
323 - Not yet, but soon.\\
324 - Okay.\\
325 - (humming)\\
326 - (humming)\\
327 - Lucy...\\
328 - Yeah?\\
329 - What are you doing?\\
330 - Rehearsing.\\
331 - Oh.\\
332 - Rehearsing?!\\
333 - Yeah, for the act\\
334 - I'm going to do at Fred's lodge.\\
335 - Oh.\\
336 - Lucy, you can't do that kind of an
act.\\
337 - Ricky, I'm gonna have bells tied all
over me\\
338 - and I'm going to jiggle a tune.\\
339 - You know, I've been married to you so
long\\
340 - that that sounds logical.\\
341 - It's gonna be the hit of the show,
now, you see.\\
342 - Hmm, hmm, ho, ho, ho...\\
343 - Would you mind stop rehearsing long
enough\\
344 - to jiggle me some dinner?\\
345 - Okay.\\
346 - (humming)\\
347 - You'd better make it scrambled eggs.\\
348 - Hey, your agent called.
I forgot to tell you.\\
349 - He wants you to call him.\\
350 - Johnny?\\
351 - Yeah.\\
352 - (phone ringing)\\
353 - Johnny Clark speaking.\\
354 - Hello, Johnny, this is Ricky.
You called me?\\

numbers you're gonna do\\
356 - Friday night on the Western show?\\
357 - Western show? What Western show?\\
358 - Well, don't you remember?\\
359 - I asked you to get together a program
for the rodeo.\\
360 - Yeah?\\
361 - Well?\\
362 - What's that got to do with a Western
show?!\\
363 - Oh, no!\\
364 - Don't you know what a rodeo is?\\
365 - Of course I know what it is.\\
366 - It's a little box, and it has a dial\\
367 - and out of it comes music\\
368 - and football games and all that
stuff.\\
369 - Not radio, rodeo.\\
370 - Rodeo is a big Western show with
horses and cowboys.\\
371 - Oh, are you crazy or something?\\
372 - I can't do that.\\
373 - I got a rumba band.\\
374 - You want to be sued for breach of
contract?\\
375 - Well, I don't...\\
376 - Breach of contract?\\
377 - Fine. I knew you wouldn't disappoint
your public.\\
378 - I'll tell them everything's all set.
Good-bye.\\
379 - Mira, que tiene cosa de decirle a
esta gente mira...\\
380 - (grumbling)\\
381 - What's the matter, honey?\\
382 - What's the matter?
I'll tell you what's the matter.\\
383 - I'm going back to Cuba where the
language makes some sense.\\
384 - You Americans sure have a funny way
of talking.\\
385 - We have a funny way of talking?\\
386 - Yeah. You know that radio show I was
supposed to do?\\
387 - Yeah?\\
388 - It turned out to be a rodeo.\\
389 - Oh, no!\\
390 - Oh, yeah.\\
391 - Now I got to put a whole Western show
in two days.\\
392 - Well, what do you know?\\
393 - A Western show.\\
394 - Yeah. I'd never been in such a mess
in my life.\\
395 - You never had it so good.\\
396 - What are you talking about?\\
397 - If I was a Western snake, I'd bite
you.\\
398 - I got to go back to Cuba.\\
399 - No, no, listen.\\
400 - Ricky, Ricky, the show we're gonna do\\
401 - for Fred's lodge is a Western show.\\
402 - Oh, now, honey, now, come on.\\
403 - Look, it's a natural.\\
404 - You need a Western show, we got a
Western show.\\
405 - It's heaven-sent.\\
406 - Well, send it back.\\
407 - Now, Ricky,\\
408 - you'd better think twice about this.\\
409 - Now, honey, I got a lot of work to
do.\\
410 - I got to call some agents and see if
they've got some\\
411 - Western acts in town.
Now, don't...\\
412 - (grumbling)\\
413 - Hello, Harry?\\
414 - Look, this is Ricky.\\
415 - Look, they've booked me\\
416 - into a Western show,\\
417 - and I want to know if I can get some
Western acts from you.\\
418 - Yes.\\
419 - What about Tex Ritter?\\
420 - He's out of town.\\
421 - What about that, uh, fellow, that
Gabby Hayes?\\
422 - He's very good. No.\\
423 - RICKY: Well, how about that fellow
that plays Wyatt Earp?\\
424 - You know, O'Brien.\\
425 - Oh. Well, look, I-I know that the
rodeo\\
426 - is booked into the Garden for two
weeks,\\
427 - but there must be some Western acts
around\\
428 - that are not at the Garden.\\
429 - You couldn't get anybody at all?\\

with his teddy bear.\\
75 - And that is why you find me sitting
here\\
76 - with my coat and my boots on.\\
77 - Phew!\\
78 - Wow!\\
79 - What's the matter with you?\\
80 - I'm worn out from just listening.\\
81 - Honestly, I'm so tired, I could
scream.\\
82 - Well, go ahead and scream.\\
83 - It'll do you good.\\
84 - I'm too tired.\\
85 - Honey, it's just silly for you to get
this tired every day.\\
86 - Little Ricky is three years old now.\\
87 - There's only one thing to do.\\
88 - Now, don't start that again.\\
89 - What again?\\
90 - You want me to send him to nursery
school.\\
91 - That's right.\\
92 - Well, I won't hear of it.\\
93 - He's entirely too young.\\
94 - You said that six months ago.\\
95 - And I was right.\\
96 - We're just gonna have to wait until
he gets older.\\
97 - How much older?\\
98 - Well, until I feel he's old enough\\
99 - to go to nursery school.\\
100 - Well, he's gonna look pretty silly\\
101 - playing in a sand pile when he's 30
years old.\\
102 - Now, honey, don't be funny.\\
103 - Now, look, it's not, it's not fair to
the kid.\\
104 - He needs children his own age to play
with.\\
105 - He has plenty of playmates.\\
106 - Who?\\
107 - Me, Ethel, Fred.\\
108 - Well, Fred and you and Ethel\\
109 - are not exactly Little Ricky's age.\\
110 - Although at times you act like you
were.\\
111 - It may interest you to know\\
112 - that one of the world's leading
authorities on baby care\\
113 - does not think he should go to
nursery school.\\
114 - Who's that?\\
115 - Dr. Spock.\\
116 - I've been reading his book\\
117 - ever since Little Ricky was born.\\
118 - Now, this is what he has to say on
the subject. I quote,\\
119 - "A good nursery school does not take
the place of home."\\
120 - So, there.\\
121 - Well, that doesn't sound right to me.\\
122 - Let me see that book.\\
123 - I told you what it said.\\
124 - What's good enough for Dr. Spock\\
125 - is good enough for me.\\
126 - Let me see the book.
Give it to me.\\
127 - Why'd you want to see the book?\\
128 - I told you what it says.\\
129 - I want to see the...\\
130 - Uh-huh. You didn't quite finish that
sentence.\\
131 - "A good nursery school doesn't take
the place of the home.\\
132 - "It adds to it.\\
133 - "Most children benefit from a good
nursery school.\\
134 - "It is particularly valuable for the
only child,\\
135 - "for the child without much chance to
play with others\\
136 - and for the child who lives in a
small apartment."\\
137 - That's what the good doctor says.\\
138 - Well, what does he know?\\
139 - This man is supposed to be one of the
authorities on baby care.\\
140 - He says that Little Ricky should go
to nursery school.\\
141 - I don't care.\\
142 - Well, I do.\\
143 - I say that he should go to nursery
school\\
144 - and so does Dr. Spook.\\
145 - Dr. Spock, and he doesn't know
everything.\\
146 - Well...\\
147 - was he ever a mother?\\
148 - Now, Lucy...\\
149 - He can't go. He'll catch germs there.\\
150 - Germs?\\
151 - Yes. All those other children have
germs.\\
152 - And I suppose that we have\\
153 - the only sanitary child in New York
City.\\
154 - You know perfectly well\\
155 - that as soon as a child starts to go
to school,\\
156 - they come home with chicken pox and
measles\\
157 - and all sorts of nasty little
diseases.\\
158 - Well, that's part of being a child.\\
159 - What are you gonna do?\\
160 - Seal him up in a plastic bag until
he's 21 years old?\\
161 - Oh...\\
162 - Now, look, Lucy, this does it.\\
163 - I want you to promise me that
tomorrow morning\\
164 - you are going to enroll Little Ricky
in nursery school.\\
165 - No buts.\\
166 - But Ricky...\\
167 - No, no buts!\\
168 - All right.\\
169 - All right.\\
170 - You'll be a better mother, too.\\
171 - You won't get so tired.\\
172 - ("Pop Goes the Weasel" playing)\\
173 - (wailing)\\
174 - What's the matter?\\
175 - What are you crying about?\\
176 - We're losing our baby.\\
177 - Now, honey, it's only nursery school.\\
178 - Today, nursery school.\\
179 - Tomorrow, college.\\
180 - And then he'll get married and have
children of his own.\\
181 - We'll never see him again.\\
182 - (chuckling): Oh... now, Mama.\\
183 - Come on.\\
184 - (sobbing): I'm losing my baby.\\
185 - (chuckling)\\
186 - Lucy?\\
187 - Yeah?\\
188 - Have you seen Ethel?\\
189 - Not since this morning.\\
190 - She took Little Ricky to the park\\
191 - while I went to nursery school.\\
192 - You went to nursery school?\\
193 - Yeah.\\
194 - I thought you promised Ricky\\
195 - you'd take the baby to nursery
school.\\
196 - I promised him I would enroll the
baby in nursery school\\
197 - and I did enroll him.\\
198 - I didn't promise he would attend.\\
199 - Oh, brother.\\
200 - What's he gonna say when he hears
that?\\
201 - Nothing, if we all keep our big
blabbery lips buttoned up.\\
202 - Now, don't worry.\\
203 - I'm not the one to break that kind of
news to him.\\
204 - Well.\\
205 - Hi.\\
206 - Hi, Rick. Got to check the furnace.
Bye, Rick.\\
207 - He sure is in a hurry.\\
208 - Yeah.\\
209 - Say, uh, how did Little Ricky like
nursery school?\\
210 - Uh...\\
211 - You took him, didn't you?\\
212 - I enrolled him just like I promised
you.\\
213 - Well, how did he like it?\\
214 - He didn't say.\\
215 - He's a close-mouthed little rascal.\\
216 - What are you talking about, honey?\\
217 - What did they do there?\\
218 - Oh, you know the kind of things they
do\\
219 - in nursery school.\\
220 - No, I don't.\\
221 - You went to nursery school in Cuba,
didn't you?\\
222 - Yeah.\\
223 - Well, they do the same things over
here, only in English.\\
224 - Lucy, what's the big, uh, secret?\\
225 - I mean, what, what, what's, uh...\\
226 - What-what do they have over there?\\
227 - Well, it's sort of hard to describe.\\
228 - What do you mean, hard to describe?\\
229 - Do they, uh...\\
230 - Th-They must have sand piles and
swings and slides.\\
231 - Good. That's just what they have.\\
232 - Well, how about finger-painting and,
uh... building blocks?\\
233 - All right.\\
234 - What else do they have?\\
235 - Oh, you name it and they got it.\\
236 - I got to finish my cake.\\
237 - Remarkable school.\\
238 - Lucy?\\
239 - Yeah?\\
240 - Say, listen, Lucy,\\
241 - I've been thinking this over.\\
242 - And I'll bet you when Ricky finds out\\
243 - that you didn't take the baby to
nursery...\\
244 - Aha!\\
245 - Thank you, Ethel bean-spiller.\\
246 - Lucy, come here.\\
247 - Hi, Ricky.\\
248 - RICKY: Lucy!\\
249 - Gee, I didn't know you were home.\\
250 - I didn't hear you come up the stairs.\\
251 - Oh, you!\\
252 - Well, it's all your fault.\\
253 - You're the one that pestered Fred\\
254 - to have the stairs carpeted.\\
255 - Oh...\\
256 - Come here.\\
257 - Why did you tell me\\
258 - that you took Ricky to nursery
school?\\
259 - I didn't.\\
260 - You did, too.\\
261 - I did not!\\
262 - I said I enrolled him and I did
enroll him.\\
263 - I just didn't take him there.\\
264 - Lucy, I'm ashamed of you.\\
265 - Well, I tried, but he refused.\\
266 - He refused?\\
267 - Yes, yes. Ethel was right here\\
268 - when I asked him.
Didn't I ask him?\\
269 - Yup, she asked him.\\
270 - She said, "Little Ricky,\\
271 - "you don't want to go to that nasty
old school, do you?"\\
272 - Whose side are you on?\\
273 - Oh, what's the difference.\\
274 - I'm glad the cat's out of the bag.\\
275 - I'm his godmother and I think he
should\\
276 - go to nursery school.
If you ask me...\\
277 - Yeah, well, nobody's asking you.\\
278 - Just butt out!\\
279 - Never mind.
You keep butting in.\\
280 - I never know anything around here\\
281 - if you didn't come up once in a while\\
282 - and spin the beans out of the cat
bag.\\
283 - It's not "spin the beans out of the
cat bag."\\
284 - It's, it's "spill the beans" or "let
the cat out of the bag."\\
285 - It doesn't matter which way it goes.\\
286 - The only thing that is important is
that tomorrow morning\\
287 - Little Ricky is gonna go to nursery
school\\
288 - because I am going to take him.\\
289 - This is delicious.\\
290 - RICKY: Little Ricky, come on.\\
291 - Let's go to nursery school.\\
292 - Little Ricky?\\
293 - Come on, amigo!\\
294 - Let's go to nursery school.\\
295 - You seen Little Ricky?\\
296 - No.\\
297 - What do you mean, "no"?\\
298 - Where can he be?\\
299 - Maybe he didn't want to go to nursery
school,\\
300 - so he ran away from home.\\
301 - Lucy, you've hidden him!\\
302 - Why, whatever makes you say a thing
like that?\\
303 - Ay, mira que tiene esta mujer, las
cosas...\\
304 - Little Ricky, where are you?\\
305 - Little Ricky!\\
306 - Little Ricky?!\\
307 - Lucy, where is he?\\
308 - I'll never tell.\\
309 - Little Ricky, come out wherever
you're hiding! Come on out!\\
310 - Why don't you try calling "Olly,
olly, oxen free!"\\
311 - What does that mean?\\
312 - Oh, I forget you're unfamiliar\\
313 - with our American expressions.\\
314 - You see, in this country,\\
315 - children have a game called
hide-and-seek.\\
316 - And when the player who is "it"\\
317 - wants all of his little playmates\\
318 - to come out from wherever they're
hiding,\\
319 - he yells, "Olly, olly, oxen free!"\\
320 - And all the little children come
scampering out,\\
321 - and the game is over.\\
322 - And do you also have an expression\\
323 - for whenever a husband is tired of
playing hide-and-seek,\\
324 - and he's just about read to hit the
wife in the nose?\\
325 - Uh, not up to now, we don't.\\
326 - Look, I have a right to know where he
is.\\
327 - He's half my child, you know?\\
328 - Well, he's half mine, too,\\
329 - and, unfortunately, when I hid my
half,\\
330 - your half went right along with it.\\
331 - Well, unfortunately,\\
332 - your half has to go to nursery school
with my half.\\
333 - Not until you find him.\\
334 - Lucy, where is he?\\
335 - (door opening)\\
336 - There he is!\\
337 - Fred! I thought I told you to stay
out\\
338 - until at least 11:00.\\
339 - Come on, son.
How are you, partner?\\
340 - Oh, Fred!
Oh, sweetie pie!\\
341 - I'll talk to you later.\\
342 - You're going to nursery school.\\
343 - Oh, please.\\
344 - You be a good boy now.\\
345 - Mind the teacher,\\
346 - and don't go near any of these other
children that have germs!\\
347 - Oh...\\
348 - Fred Mertz!\\
349 - Aah, don't start on me, Lucy.\\
350 - I'm too weak to defend myself.\\
351 - Men are not cut out to be mothers.\\
352 - Oh...\\
353 - He just loved school.\\
354 - He didn't even want to come home.\\
355 - No kidding.
That's wonderful.\\
356 - Yeah, and look, look, his first
painting.\\
357 - ETHEL: Oh, isn't that great?\\
358 - Isn't it wonderful?\\
359 - ETHEL: Yeah.\\
360 - You know what it is, don't you?\\
361 - Sure.
Yeah.\\
362 - What?\\
363 - Oh, uh...\\
364 - It's a sailboat.\\
365 - Oh, Ethel, it's a house.\\
366 - It is?\\
367 - Sure.\\
368 - Well, now, wait a minute.\\
369 - You're both wrong.\\
370 - It's an elephant.\\
371 - You know, he's smarter than I
thought.\\
372 - This is a picture of an elephant
sailing a houseboat.\\
373 - That's right. Yeah.
Of course it is.
That's right.\\
374 - Isn't it wonderful. I'm going to have
it framed and hang it\\
375 - in my bedroom.
You can...\\
376 - RICKY: Hi.
Honey, honey,\\
377 - Look! Look!	     Hi, Rick.\\
378 - The first thing your son ever did in
school.\\
379 - Well, how about that?!\\
380 - Isn't that great?\\
381 - Yes, it is.\\
382 - Isn't it wonderful?
Boy!\\
383 - I bet, I bet he's gonna be another
Grandpa Moses.\\
384 - You know what it is, don't you?\\
385 - Why, sure. It's a...\\
386 - It's an, it's an elephant sailing a
houseboat.\\
387 - Of course. Sure.
What else could it be?\\
388 - That's right.
Isn't that wonderful?\\
389 - Isn't that wonderful the talent that
child has shown in one day?\\
390 - Well, it's hereditary, you know.\\
391 - Oh, hereditary!\\
392 - It's the nursery school.\\
393 - It's working out fine just like I
told you it would.\\
394 - Like you...?\\
395 - (chuckling): Mira que esta
muchacha...\\
396 - Hey, hey, hey, hey, now, watch your
language.\\
397 - The baby will be learning Spanish any
day now.\\
398 - (laughing)\\
399 - Oh, I think I hear the baby.\\
400 - The baby learning Spanish!\\
401 - He's too young.\\
402 - Well, I don't know.\\
403 - I was speaking Spanish when I was his
age.\\
404 - Oh, well...\\
405 - Well, I hope you are satisfied.\\
406 - Well, what's the matter?\\
407 - The baby is sneezing.\\
408 - Sneezing?\\
409 - I told you that nursery school\\
410 - is nothing but a hotbed of bacteria.\\
411 - Dr. Gettleman?
This is Lucy Ricardo.\\
412 - Something's wrong with our baby.\\
413 - Can you come over right away?\\
414 - There's nothing to worry about, Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
415 - It's just a mild tonsillitis.\\
416 - Are you sure?\\
417 - Oh, yes.\\
418 - I'll write you a prescription.\\
419 - You and that nursery school!\\
420 - You can't blame it on the nursery
school, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
421 - After all, this is the fourth attack
of tonsillitis\\
422 - Little Ricky's had this year.\\
423 - It's all your fault.\\
424 - My fault?\\
425 - He just told you it had nothing to do
with nursery school.\\
426 - He inherited his weak tonsils from
you.\\
427 - What are you talking about?\\
428 - Everybody knows Cubans have weak
tonsils.\\
429 - Doctor, do Cubans have weak tonsils?\\
430 - Not that I ever heard of.\\
431 - Thank you.\\
432 - Well, he certainly didn't get them
from me.\\
433 - I had the strongest tonsils on the
block.\\
434 - They'd bulge with muscles.\\
435 - People used to come from miles around\\
436 - saying, "Let me look at your
tonsils."\\
437 - Oh...\\
438 - Well...\\
439 - I'm afraid you'll have a siege like
this to look forward to\\
440 - every time he has a cold, Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
441 - Oh, dear!\\
442 - As I strongly I advise that when this
infection clears up,\\
443 - we remove those tonsils.\\
444 - Oh, no, Doctor!\\
445 - Well, honey, we don't have to decide
right now.\\
446 - He's just a little baby!
We can talk about it later.\\
447 - I know, sweetheart.\\
448 - Thank you for coming, Doctor.\\
449 - I'll drop this at the drugstore\\
450 - and have them send it up.\\
451 - That infection will clear up in a few
days.\\
452 - Well...
Good night.\\
453 - Good night.
Good night, Doctor.\\
454 - Oh...\\
455 - LITTLE RICKY: Mama!\\
456 - Oh, I'm coming, dear.\\
457 - LITTLE RICKY: Mama, my teddy bear.\\
458 - Oh, he wants his teddy bear.\\
459 - The patient is being flown in.\\
460 - Tell all those medical students
interested\\
461 - to be ready to come over as soon as
we call.\\
462 - This is a most unusual operation.\\
463 - Good-bye.\\
464 - Come on, honey.
Let's go.\\
465 - Oh, I hate to leave the baby like
this.\\
466 - Honey, the operation was over hours
ago.\\
467 - The baby's in fine shape.\\
468 - He's getting the best of care.\\
469 - You haven't eaten all day. Come on,\\
470 - you gotta eat something.\\
471 - Oh, all right.
Nurse?
Yes?\\
472 - Please take good care of our little
boy until we get back.\\
473 - Ricky Ricardo Jr., Room 602.\\
474 - We will.\\
475 - Okay. I'll be right back as soon as I
have dinner\\
476 - and then you won't have to bother,\\
477 - 'cause I'm gonna spend the night with
him.\\
478 - Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
479 - Parents are not allowed\\
480 - to stay overnight with their
children.\\
481 - Oh, but this is the first time\\
482 - our baby's ever been in a hospital
and I promised him.\\
483 - Oh, my dear, I'm sorry-- regulations.\\
484 - Re-re... Well, well, we'll just have
to get permission.\\
485 - We'll have to call Dr. Gettleman.\\
486 - I'm afraid that won't do you any
good.\\
487 - But I... I promised him.\\
488 - But, honey...\\
489 - Well, she says it's regulations.\\
490 - But, honey, I promised him. I
promised him.\\
491 - I... I've never broken a promise to
him in my life.\\
492 - I know, honey. Well, you shouldn't
have promised...\\
493 - And I-I promised that I'd bring him
his teddy bear\\
494 - so he could to cuddle with it.\\
495 - I know, honey, but there's nothing
you can do about it.\\
496 - It's against regulations.\\
497 - There's nothing we can do about it.\\
498 - Now, come on, let me get some dinner
for you\\
499 - and have a good night's sleep, huh?
Come on.\\
500 - Good night.\\
501 - Good night.\\
502 - See you in the morning.\\
503 - Yeah. See you in the morning.\\
504 - Yes?\\
505 - Good evening.\\
506 - Can I help you?\\
507 - No, thank you.\\
508 - Are you a patient?\\
509 - Oh, of course.\\
510 - The maternity ward\\
511 - is just in there, to the right.\\
512 - Would you register first, please?\\
513 - (mumbling): ...in the morning. Thank
you.\\
514 - Wait a minute!\\
515 - Say, did you just send up a maternity
case?\\
516 - You didn't?!\\
517 - Thanks.\\
518 - Madam?\\
519 - Madam!\\
520 - NURSE: Madam!\\
521 - Where did she go?\\
522 - Madam?\\
523 - Did a red-haired woman just go
through here?\\
524 - I didn't see anyone. Why?\\
525 - Well, she just ran right by my desk.\\
526 - Patient?\\
527 - Maternity.\\
528 - When?\\
529 - Any minute.\\
530 - I mean, when did she run past you?\\
531 - Just now.\\
532 - Look, if you see her let me know,
will you?\\
533 - Okay.\\
534 - (murmur of conversation)\\
535 - (hospital staff chattering)\\
536 - All right, nurse, we're ready for the
next patient.\\
537 - Uh, just a minute. Let go.\\
538 - What's the matter?\\
539 - M-M-My patient changed his mind.\\
540 - He doesn't want an operation.\\
541 - Do you? No, no, no.\\
542 - He's decided to hang on to whatever
it was\\
543 - you were gonna take out.\\
544 - Oh, cut the nonsense.\\
545 - Now, wait a minute.\\
546 - Dr. Barnett's waiting to perform this
operation.\\
547 - Believe me, this man does not want to
be cut open!\\
548 - He does not want to be cut open!\\
549 - This man does not want to be cut
open!\\
550 - Gentlemen, I want to apologize\\
551 - for calling you in here at this hour
of the night,\\
552 - but this is a most unusual operation.\\
553 - You may never have a chance\\
554 - of seeing anything like this again.\\
555 - Thought you should see it.\\
556 - I understand a few of you\\
557 - have never witnessed surgery before,\\
558 - and under those circumstances,\\
559 - we always have a few incidents of
fainting.\\
560 - Now, if you feel as though you're
going to keel over,\\
561 - why, just step back,\\
562 - so you don't fall over the patient.\\
563 - (clamoring)\\
564 - LUCY: Listen, you don't understand.\\
565 - This is a mistake.
A big mistake.\\
566 - Nurse, what's going on here?\\
567 - M-My patient has changed his mind.\\
568 - He doesn't want to have the
operation.\\
569 - He doesn't want to have the
operation?\\
570 - No, he doesn't want any part of this
whole ordeal.\\
571 - Well, why, you've got the sheet
pulled over his head.\\
572 - He can't stand the sight of blood.\\
573 - Why, why, this is most unusual.\\
574 - Oh, he says he wants to go home.\\
575 - I'm gonna have to take him home.\\
576 - He lives quite a ways from here-- New
Rochelle.\\
577 - I have to take him all the way out
there.\\
578 - This is unusual.\\
579 - Well, what patient is that?\\
580 - This is your patient for the
operation, Doctor.\\
581 - Well, what patient is this?\\
582 - (groaning)\\
583 - Get ahold of yourself.\\
584 - Doctor!\\
585 - Nurse?\\
586 - Yes?\\
587 - Look, I'm looking for my wife, Mrs.
Ricardo,\\
588 - and I think she's in Room 602 with
our child.\\
589 - No, she couldn't be.
It isn't permitted.\\
590 - Well, I got a feeling that that's
where she is.\\
591 - You evidently don't know our rules.\\
592 - Well, you evidently don't know my
wife.\\
593 - No one missing from the psychiatric
ward, Nurse.\\
594 - Thank you, dear.\\
595 - I'll keep looking.\\
596 - Look, if you would just take me to
Room...\\
597 - Oh, I'm awfully sorry,\\
598 - but I just don't have the time.\\
599 - The whole hospital's in a turmoil,
trying to find\\
600 - some screwball, redheaded nurse that
has gone berserk.\\
601 - Was she carrying a teddy bear?\\
602 - How did you know?\\
603 - Well, let me put it this way.\\
604 - I am looking for my screwball,
redheaded wife\\
605 - who has been berserk for 15 years.\\
606 - Now, if you'll just take me to this
Room 602,\\
607 - I got a hunch that we're gonna solve
both our problems.\\
608 - Well, very well, but I'm quite sure
it won't do a bit of good.\\
609 - Well, you never can tell.\\
610 - It's entirely against the rules.\\

\subsection {Episode 10: Ricky's European Booking}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - ANNOUNCER: And now, "I Love Lucy."\\
3 - (applause)\\
4 - (theme song fading out)\\
5 - (snoring)\\
6 - Fred?
Hey, Fred.\\
7 - I'll have this lamp fixed in a
minute, honeybunch.\\
8 - Don't...\\
9 - Oh, it's you.\\
10 - Listen, I'm sorry I startled you,
Fred,\\
11 - but, uh, I got a serious problem, and
I need your advice.\\
12 - Well, what's the trouble?\\
13 - Well, my agent has booked me and my
band\\
14 - on a tour of Europe.\\
15 - Going to Europe?\\
16 - Hey, that's terrific.\\
17 - Now, what's the problem?\\
18 - I won't be able to take Lucy along.\\
19 - You know, that is a problem.\\
20 - Well, you see, it's only a three-week
trip,\\
21 - and we'll be doing mostly
one-nighters,\\
22 - so I won't have any time\\
23 - for sightseeing or stuff like that.\\
24 - And being such a short trip,\\
25 - I can't afford to take her with me.\\
26 - Well, that makes sense.\\
27 - To you and me, yes, but what about
Lucy?\\
28 - What am I going to do?\\
29 - Well, you could go out some night\\
30 - to buy a pack of cigarettes\\
31 - and not come back for three weeks.\\
32 - Oh, Fred.\\
33 - Hey, I know how to fix it.\\
34 - How?\\
35 - Don't go.\\
36 - I gotta go.\\
37 - It's good for my career.\\
38 - Besides, I already signed the
contract.\\
39 - Yeah, well.\\
40 - Listen, suppose I tell her the truth.\\
41 - You think that maybe she'll be
reasonable this time?\\
42 - Well, suppose I promise her something
else.\\
43 - Suppose I say that later on I will
take her\\
44 - on a wonderful trip to Europe, just
the two of us.\\
45 - That will never work.\\
46 - Oh, now, wait just a minute.\\
47 - Let's see how it sounds.
You be Lucy.\\
48 - I'll be Lu...\\
49 - Just pretend you're Lucy and I come
home and I say:\\
50 - Hi, honey. I'm home.\\
51 - Lucy, my agent tells me\\
52 - that he has booked me on a tour of
Europe.\\
53 - (falsetto): Europe?! Oh, honey,
that's wonderful!\\
54 - I don't believe it.\\
55 - I'm so thrilled for you.\\
56 - (laughing): Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!\\
57 - Caroline, guess what.\\
58 - I'm going to Europe. Good-bye.\\
59 - Oh!\\
60 - Oh!\\
61 - Oh, now, Fred, she won't act like
that.\\
62 - Are we talking about the same Lucy?\\
63 - Now, if I promise her a wonderful
trip later on,\\
64 - I think she'll be reasonable.\\
65 - My Lucy has red hair and blue eyes.\\
66 - What does your Lucy look like?\\
67 - Well, there's one good thing about
this idea.\\
68 - What?\\
69 - It's the only one I've got.\\
70 - Come on, let's see how it works.\\
71 - (chuckling): All right, I'm with you.\\
72 - Honey, I'm home!\\
73 - Okay, dear.\\
74 - Hello. Hi, Fred.\\
75 - Hi, Lucy.\\
76 - Honey, I've got something to tell
you.\\
77 - What?
My agent has booked me\\
78 - and my band on a tour of Europe.\\
79 - Europe?!\\
80 - Oh, honey!\\
81 - That's wonderful!\\
82 - Oh, honey!\\
83 - Oh, Fred, isn't that exciting? Oh,
Europe!\\
84 - LUCY: Honey, you don't know how much\\
85 - I'm looking forward to this.\\
86 - For years and years and years!\\
87 - Caroline, this is Lucy.\\
88 - Guess what. We're going to Europe.\\
89 - Yes. Good-bye.\\
90 - (hangs up phone)\\
91 - Just call me Dunninger.\\
92 - What do I do now?\\
93 - Well, you're married to her.\\
94 - I just read her mind.\\
95 - Hello, Josephine?\\
96 - Uh, good-bye, Josephine.\\
97 - Look, sweetie, we got a lot of things
to discuss.\\
98 - Oh, I know.
My, my overseas shots,\\
99 - my tickets, my, uh, my new clothes...\\
100 - I can't take you along.\\
101 - You can't take me along.\\
102 - Uh, I gotta have my luggage and
camera.\\
103 - What do you mean you can't take me
along?\\
104 - Honey, look, sit down a minute, will
you?\\
105 - I want to explain this to you.\\
106 - Look, it's a very short trip.\\
107 - It's only about three weeks.\\
108 - I'll be doing mostly one-nighters.\\
109 - I won't have any time for sightseeing
or stuff like that.\\
110 - And being such a short trip,\\
111 - I can't afford to take you along.\\
112 - You understand, don't you?\\
113 - Yeah, I understand.\\
114 - Good.\\
115 - But why can't I go?\\
116 - Now, honey, listen, I'll take you\\
117 - on a wonderful trip to Europe later
on.\\
118 - Just the two of us.\\
119 - No! I want to go this time.\\
120 - Well, I can't afford it this time.\\
121 - Oh, Ricky, you never take me
anyplace.\\
122 - What do you mean I never take you
anyplace?\\
123 - We just came back from a wonderful
trip\\
124 - to Hollywood just a month ago.\\
125 - Yeah, but where have you taken me
lately?\\
126 - Now, look, sweetheart, you be a good
girl,\\
127 - be a good girl, and I promise you
that next year\\
128 - I'll take you on a wonderful trip to
Europe,\\
129 - just the two of us.\\
130 - Oh, sure.\\
131 - I will. I promise you.\\
132 - Well, okay, if you promise.\\
133 - Ah, that's my baby.\\
134 - What a wonderful wife I've got.\\
135 - I knew you'd understand.\\
136 - Listen, I tell you what.\\
137 - Tonight just go out for dinner.\\
138 - Just the two of us.\\
139 - Okay.		All right?\\
140 - Okay, honey.\\
141 - That's my baby.\\
142 - (sighing)\\
143 - Lucy, Lucy I was just down in the
market\\
144 - and the butcher told me you were
gonna go to Europe.\\
145 - The butcher? How did he know?\\
146 - The grocery boy told him.\\
147 - How did he get it?\\
148 - Well, he just made a delivery to
Marion Strong.\\
149 - Well, how in the world did Ma...?\\
150 - Oh, Marion Strong.\\
151 - She's just a hop, skip and a blab
from Caroline Appleby.\\
152 - What's the difference how they found
out?\\
153 - Aren't you excited?\\
154 - When do you leave?\\
155 - I don't.
I'm not going.\\
156 - What do you mean?\\
157 - Well, Ricky's only gonna be there for
three weeks.\\
158 - Well, you could see a lot of Europe
in three weeks.\\
159 - Yeah, I know, but he's gonna be so
busy, and I'd be all alone.\\
160 - All alone in those fancy Paris
shops--\\
161 - just you and Ricky's checkbook.\\
162 - Yeah, I know, but he doesn't think I
ought to go with him.\\
163 - What husband would?\\
164 - Oh, Ethel, he'd love to take me if he
could.\\
165 - Oh, sure.\\
166 - He would, he said so, and he also
said\\
167 - he couldn't take me this time, he'd
take me on a trip next year\\
168 - all over Europe, just the two of us.\\
169 - And wipe that cynical look off your
face.\\
170 - Huh.\\
171 - He gave me his promise.\\
172 - He'd never broken his promise to me.\\
173 - Uh-huh.\\
174 - Oh, you just don't know Ricky, that's
all.\\
175 - He's a man, isn't he?\\
176 - Well, yes.\\
177 - Oh, boy, what a setup for him.\\
178 - Three glorious weeks in Europe.\\
179 - Just the band.\\
180 - No wives along.\\
181 - Yeah.\\
182 - And then a whole week on glamorous
shipboard\\
183 - and then London.\\
184 - And then Rome.\\
185 - And then... Paris.\\
186 - Yeah.\\
187 - And he says he can't afford\\
188 - to take you along.\\
189 - Three weeks isn't long enough.\\
190 - He'll be too busy.\\
191 - Oh, brother.\\
192 - Did he ever pull a wool over your
eyes.\\
193 - Yeah.\\
194 - Oh, hi. Hi, Ethel.
Hi.\\
195 - Where, where do you want to go to
eat, sweetie?\\
196 - Don't you "sweetie" me!\\
197 - What's the matter?\\
198 - I know what you're up to,\\
199 - you-you-you Cuban wool-puller!\\
200 - (howling scream)\\
201 - What happened?\\
202 - (chuckling)\\
203 - Lucy, come here.\\
204 - (phone ringing)\\
205 - Hello?\\
206 - Oh, hello, Barney.\\
207 - Look, I was trying to get you all day
yesterday.\\
208 - Yeah. Say, Barney, how would you like
your old job back?\\
209 - Oh, you're working for Cougie now,
huh?\\
210 - Well, uh... look, Barney,\\
211 - my agent has booked me on a tour of
Europe\\
212 - and I need a good manager.\\
213 - Yeah, band manager.\\
214 - Well, look, I can't think of anybody.\\
215 - If you happen to think of someone\\
216 - that you think would be good, would
you have him call me?\\
217 - Thanks a lot, Barney.\\
218 - Good-bye.\\
219 - Ricky?\\
220 - Yeah?\\
221 - I'm speaking to you again.\\
222 - You are?\\
223 - Yeah, I know a wonderful manager for
your band.\\
224 - Me.		Who?\\
225 - Honey, it wouldn't cost you a cent\\
226 - and I get to go along.\\
227 - Now, look, Lucy, I'd love to be able
to do it,\\
228 - but a bandman has a lot of
responsibilities.\\
229 - He has to keep the luggage straight,\\
230 - he has to see that all the boys get
on the right train,\\
231 - he has to make all the hotel
reservations...\\
232 - Yeah, well, give me a chance.\\
233 - I'll bet I can get your boys all over
Europe.\\
234 - We... we play a lot better when we're
all in one place.\\
235 - Aw, now...\\
236 - Now, honey, forget it, it won't work.\\
237 - Well, if I raise the money myself,
can I go?\\
238 - Look, if you can raise enough money
to go to Europe,\\
239 - let me know, and I'll quit the band
business.\\
240 - You didn't answer my question.\\
241 - If I raise enough money myself,\\
242 - and it doesn't cost you a cent, can I
go?\\
243 - That's impossible.\\
244 - Well, if I can and it doesn't, can I?\\
245 - Sure. Why not?\\
246 - Good! I'm going to Europe.\\
247 - Oh, boy! I'll call mother\\
248 - and ask her if she could stay with
the baby for three weeks.\\
249 - Oh, honey! Honey, you're the most
wonderful husband\\
250 - in the whole world.\\
251 - Mmm.... huh!\\
252 - I love you, huh!\\
253 - Uh-oh, wrong apartment.\\
254 - Oh, Ethel, I don't need you now.\\
255 - Ricky said that I could go to Europe
with him.\\
256 - Oh, really?
Yeah.\\
257 - Well, there are some conditions.\\
258 - Never mind now.
I'm going.\\
259 - Oh, that's wonderful, Rick.\\
260 - I'm sorry about this.\\
261 - She made me do this, Rick.\\
262 - (sighing): I'm sorry.\\
263 - I'm gonna get to go to Europe!\\
264 - Oh, Lucy, I'm gonna get to\\
265 - my goodness!
to go to Europe!\\
266 - That's wonderful.
Fred let me...\\
267 - I want to ask you something.\\
268 - Yeah?\\
269 - Listen, who used to handle your act\\
270 - when you were in vaudeville, you
know?\\
271 - Nobody. I did it myself.\\
272 - You did?
I took care of the bookings\\
273 - transportation, hotels and
everything.\\
274 - No kidding.\\
275 - Yeah.\\
276 - Hmm... maybe...\\
277 - No, it won't work.\\
278 - What?\\
279 - Oh, it was just a wild thought.\\
280 - You wouldn't want to leave Ethel.\\
281 - Try me.\\
282 - How would you like to manage the band
in this European tour?\\
283 - Would I? Brother, you've got a
manager.\\
284 - RICKY: Well, wonderful, Fred.\\
285 - Oh, Fred is going to Europe!\\
286 - Oh, Fred, that's wonderful!\\
287 - You and Ricky and me and...\\
288 - Oh, dear.\\
289 - Don't mind me.\\
290 - I'll just stay here alone\\
291 - while you're all having a wonderful
trip to Europe.\\
292 - I don't want to see Europe anyway.\\
293 - It's so old.\\
294 - You just send me a postcard now and
then\\
295 - from wherever you're at.\\
296 - Oh, Fred, you have to take Ethel with
you.\\
297 - What do you mean I have to take Ethel
with me?\\
298 - Well, think of it: Ethel all alone
here in New York\\
299 - and you all alone in Paris.\\
300 - Yeah.\\
301 - You're a big help.\\
302 - Oh, no, honey, Oh...	    I didn't
mean that.\\
303 - You know I didn't.\\
304 - Now, just a minute.\\
305 - Everybody is getting upset about
nothing.\\
306 - Now, Lucy, you tell them how I said
you could go.\\
307 - Oh, oh, oh, he said I could go if
I...\\
308 - if I raise the money for my trip
myself.\\
309 - Well, that's Oh, great.      more
like it.\\
310 - Well, Fred, if Ethel raises the money\\
311 - for her trip, can she go?\\
312 - Sure; I'm a sport.
Why not?\\
313 - There, you see!\\
314 - Oh, Lucy, we couldn't raise the money
for a trip to Europe.\\
315 - Ethel, you are not holding a positive
thought.\\
316 - Now say, "We will be able to raise
the money." Say it.\\
317 - "We will be able to raise the money."\\
318 - "We will be able\\
319 - to raise the money."\\
320 - Yes, ma'am!\\
321 - Now, how much will it need?
How much it will be?\\
322 - Well, let's see now.\\
323 - Boat fare, travel expenses,\\
324 - hotel, meal for the two of you--\\
325 - I'd say about $3,000.\\
326 - You see, all we got to do is scrape
up $3,000?!\\
327 - Money found in overstuffed chairs and
sofa cushions:\\
328 - $9.73.\\
329 - Money for sugar bowls: $29.25.\\
330 - Piggy banks: $28.16.\\
331 - G.T.H.P.: $15.36.\\
332 - What's G.T.H.P.?\\
333 - Going through husband's pants.\\
334 - Oh, yeah.\\
335 - Didn't you go through Fred's pants?\\
336 - Every pair, including his World War I
cavalry britches.\\
337 - What did you get?\\
338 - A handful of lint and a Woodrow
Wilson button.\\
339 - Now, what does it all come to?\\
340 - Well, let's see.\\
341 - $200.16. Not bad, huh?\\
342 - Oh, great. Where will we get the
other $2,800?\\
343 - How much do you get for selling
blood?\\
344 - Oh, Lucy.\\
345 - What's wrong with that?\\
346 - You couldn't get $2,800 worth of
blood\\
347 - out of a herd of elephants.\\
348 - Yeah, I guess you're right.\\
349 - Let's see, how can we take our $200\\
350 - and make it into $3,000?\\
351 - Yeah.\\
352 - How about the Irish Sweepstakes?\\
353 - Nah, the odds are too great.\\
354 - Yeah. What we need is a good local
raffle\\
355 - where they're giving away two free
trips to Europe\\
356 - and we got all the tickets.\\
357 - Ha, ha! Yeah.\\
358 - Hey!
Why not hold our own raffle?\\
359 - What?\\
360 - The money we take in will pay for our
trip.\\
361 - Now, what can we raffle off?\\
362 - Your brain, for thinking up an idea
like that.\\
363 - No, no, no.
Now, this is good.\\
364 - People are always raffling off things\\
365 - like automobiles, mink coats,
television sets.\\
366 - That's it. We could take our $200,
buy a television set\\
367 - and raffle it off.\\
368 - Well, I guess it would work at that.\\
369 - Sure it would.\\
370 - Only...\\
371 - Only what?\\
372 - Well, raffles are always held for
needy causes.\\
373 - Ethel, at this moment,\\
374 - you and I are the two neediest causes
I can think of.\\
375 - Is it honest?\\
376 - It's a hundred percent honest.\\
377 - Look, we say we're gonna have a
raffle.\\
378 - We sell tickets.\\
379 - Somebody who buys a ticket wins a
television set.\\
380 - What could be more honest than that?\\
381 - I guess it is.\\
382 - Sure it is. Now, all we have to do
for our needy cause\\
383 - is think up a good phony name.\\
384 - Let's see.\\
385 - I don't suppose we could call it\\
386 - two bundles for Britain?\\
387 - No. It has to sound real.\\
388 - How about...
Ladies Overseas Aid?\\
389 - Well...\\
390 - Look, we're ladies, we want to go
overseas\\
391 - and, boy, do we need aid.\\
392 - Okay, Ladies Overseas Aid it is.\\
393 - Yes, ma'am.\\
394 - Who you gonna call?\\
395 - Mr. Feldman, the man who sold us our
television set.\\
396 - I thought maybe he could give us a
good price on one.\\
397 - FELDMAN: Hello?\\
398 - Mr. Feldman?\\
399 - Yes.\\
400 - This is Mrs. Ricky Ricardo, remember?\\
401 - Oh, yes.\\
402 - Is there something wrong with your
television set?\\
403 - Oh, no, no, it's fine.\\
404 - As a matter of fact, I want to buy
another one.\\
405 - Oh?\\
406 - Yes. We're, uh, trying to raise money\\
407 - for a needy cause, the Ladies
Overseas Aid,\\
408 - and we want to raffle off a
television set.\\
409 - I see.\\
410 - I thought maybe you could give us a
good price on one.\\
411 - The Ladies Overseas Aid?\\
412 - Yes. It's a new group but very
worthy.\\
413 - What aid do you give?\\
414 - Uh, well... just to, uh, pick a case
at random from our files,\\
415 - at the moment, we're trying to raise
money to send\\
416 - two dear little ladies to Europe to
be with their families.\\
417 - Aw, that's nice.\\
418 - Yes.\\
419 - I'll tell you what I'll do.\\
420 - I'll donate a set.\\
421 - You'll dona... oh!\\
422 - He'll donate a set.\\
423 - Oh, Mr. Feldman, that's just
wonderful of you.\\
424 - I have an idea.\\
425 - I'll have your tickets printed for
you\\
426 - with my advertising on the back\\
427 - and then we can have the drawing in
the store here.\\
428 - Is that all right with you?\\
429 - Well, that is just perfect.\\
430 - We'll be down later to discuss\\
431 - the details with you, Mr. Feldman.\\
432 - And thank you very much.
Good-bye.\\
433 - Europe, here we come!\\
434 - How about that!\\
435 - Oh, boy.\\
436 - I never knew 3,000 tickets weighed so
much.\\
437 - Whoo!\\
438 - Honey, is that you?\\
439 - My gosh, Ricky's home.\\
440 - Quick, get ahold of those.\\
441 - Put them in there.\\
442 - Yeah, dear?!\\
443 - Okay.\\
444 - Yeah, honey?!\\
445 - Hi.		    Hi, Rick.\\
446 - Hi, Ethel.	    Hi.\\
447 - I didn't know you were home, dear.\\
448 - Well, I got home early, so I was
playing with Little Ricky.\\
449 - Oh.
Mrs. Trumbull went to the market.\\
450 - Oh, oh, I see.
Well, I'm glad\\
451 - you had some time to play with the
baby.\\
452 - Well, I got to run along\\
453 - and start selling my raffle tickets.\\
454 - Oh, yeah, me, too.\\
455 - I'll see you later.\\
456 - So long.    Okay, dear.\\
457 - Bye.\\
458 - What's this about raffle tickets?\\
459 - Oh, well, well, our club is raffling
off a TV set\\
460 - to raise money for that well-known\\
461 - and very worthy organization,\\
462 - Ladies Overseas Aid.\\
463 - Oh, all right. How much?\\
464 - Oh, well, the tickets are a dollar
apiece.\\
465 - How many do you want?\\
466 - Well, honey, we've gone through this
before.\\
467 - Let's save time, huh?\\
468 - I'll take all the tickets you have.\\
469 - Oh.\\
470 - All of them?\\
471 - Yeah.\\
472 - Wow!\\
473 - I think I've only got about ten left.\\
474 - All right, I'll take them.\\
475 - Okay.
Boy, I'm getting off easy.\\
476 - I thought I was going to have to buy\\
477 - at least 20.\\
478 - 20? Oh, well, let me take another
look.\\
479 - Oh, yeah, by George, I've got 20!\\
480 - Yeah, I've got 20. Here.\\
481 - As long as it is for a worthy cause.\\
482 - Oh, it is.\\
483 - I don't know when a cause has seemed
so worthy to me.\\
484 - The need of those dear little ladies
just gets me--\\
485 - right here.\\
486 - No, no, Marge, you don't have to be
there.\\
487 - Yeah, I'll let you know if you win,\\
488 - that is, if you let me off the phone.\\
489 - I'm gonna be late for the drawing.\\
490 - (doorbell buzzing)
Oh, someone's at the door.\\
491 - I gotta go, girl. Bye.\\
492 - Yes?\\
493 - Yes, sir.	Mrs. Ricardo?\\
494 - My name is Jamison, from the district
attorney's office.\\
495 - The district attorney's...?\\
496 - That's right.\\
497 - Won't you come in, please?\\
498 - Thank you very much.\\
499 - I, uh, understand you're running a
raffle today.\\
500 - Oh, yes, we are. Would you like to
buy a ticket?\\
501 - No. I'd just like to ask a few
questions about it.\\
502 - Oh. Oh, all right.\\
503 - Well, let's see now.\\
504 - Um, we're holding the drawing at
Feldman's Appliance Store.\\
505 - The tickets are a dollar apiece.\\
506 - We're giving away rather\\
507 - a large model	Uh, TV set...	   
Mrs. Ricardo,\\
508 - tell me something about this
organization,\\
509 - the Ladies Overseas Aid.\\
510 - (laughing): Oh... ha, ha!\\
511 - Well, if you promise not to tell my
husband\\
512 - because, uh, we just sort of made the
name up.\\
513 - (giggling)\\
514 - Ladies Overseas Aid.\\
515 - It really should be called\\
516 - The Ethel Mertz And Lucy Ricardo Want
To Go To Europe Aid.\\
517 - Ha, ha, ha!\\
518 - But then nobody would buy a ticket,
would they?\\
519 - Ha, ha!\\
520 - We-we just made it up.\\
521 - Mrs. Ricardo, if you've been selling
tickets\\
522 - under false pretenses,\\
523 - you've committed a crime.\\
524 - A crime?
Oh, no, you don't understand.\\
525 - Anybody that buys a ticket\\
526 - buys a chance to win the television
set.\\
527 - Someone will win the television set,\\
528 - so nobody gets hurt, right?\\
529 - Mrs. Ricardo, the people who bought
those tickets\\
530 - thought they were contributing to a
reputable charity.\\
531 - Therefore, you've defrauded them.\\
532 - Now, fraud is a crime that's
punishable\\
533 - by one to ten years in the
penitentiary.\\
534 - But I'm going to Europe.\\
535 - I don't have time for ten years in
the penitentiary.\\
536 - No, you just may have to.\\
537 - Oh, but I didn't know it was a crime.\\
538 - I wouldn't have done it if I'd known\\
539 - it was a crime.\\
540 - I understand, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
541 - Now, look, here's what we can do.\\
542 - If you're willing to call off the
raffle\\
543 - and give the money back, we'll forget
the whole thing.\\
544 - Well, I will. I will.\\
545 - Well, I certainly hope so,\\
546 - because once the drawing's actually
held,\\
547 - the matter is out of my hands,\\
548 - and we have to prosecute.\\
549 - Oh, I hope we can make it in time.\\
550 - The drawing is in 15 minutes.\\
551 - Lucy, I've come over to ask you...\\
552 - Fred! Fred, I'm so glad you're here.\\
553 - Will you stay with the baby?\\
554 - I have to go downtown.
I'll be right back.\\
555 - You'll stay with Sure I will.	
Little Ricky?\\
556 - Sure.		Okay.\\
557 - A crime?! Are you sure?\\
558 - I can't imagine why Mrs. Ricardo
isn't here,\\
559 - but I'm sure she wouldn't mind\\
560 - if we just went ahead without her.\\
561 - So, shall we? Let's do.\\
562 - Ha, ha, ha!\\
563 - Now, you hold, Mr. Feldman.\\
564 - Here we go, oh...\\
565 - This is to keep it honest, you know.\\
566 - (chortling)\\
567 - All righty, now, shake up those
tickets, Mr. Feldman.\\
568 - Here we go.\\
569 - All righty.\\
570 - Oh, oh...\\
571 - Here we go.\\
572 - Let's see who's going to win.\\
573 - The winning number is...\\
574 - Oh...\\
575 - (laughter)\\
576 - I'm such a dope.\\
577 - (chuckling)\\
578 - Number 2725.\\
579 - Oh! That's me!
I've won.\\
580 - Mrs. Hazel Beardswell!\\
581 - Mrs. Beardswell.\\
582 - Oh, congratulations, dear.\\
583 - Ethel, Ethel, I have to talk to you.\\
584 - Oh, you're late.\\
585 - We just had the drawing.\\
586 - Here, take the money I won.\\
587 - No, no, no, no.\\
588 - Well, honey, I have something else\\
589 - I have to thank everybody for.\\
590 - Oh, you'll never know how happy this
$3,000\\
591 - is going to make two dear little
ladies.\\

594 - Mr. Feldman, thank you so much.\\
595 - (both chuckling)\\
596 - Well, thank you, Mrs. Mertz.\\
597 - But I really didn't do anything.\\
598 - But I never saw anyone work as hard\\
599 - as Mrs. Mertz and Mrs. Ricardo.\\
600 - Well, come up here, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
601 - Come on...
Oh, no, no.\\
602 - Come on.
(applause)\\
603 - She worked so hard for this money.\\
604 - Oh, they worked very hard.\\
605 - They worked so hard, you'd think\\
606 - they were gonna keep the money
themselves.\\
607 - (uproarious laughter)\\
608 - Now, now, ladies,\\
609 - I have a very pleasant surprise for
you.\\
610 - Who do you think is in town?\\
611 - Who?

614 - and we arranged this wonderful
surprise for you.\\
615 - Now, here she is, all the way from
Indiana,\\

work,\\
620 - and this money is more than we've
ever\\
621 - received before at any one time\\
622 - for the Ladies Overseas Aid...\\
623 - Uh-huh.\\
624 - ...and I'm delighted\\
625 - to be here to accept the money in
person.\\
626 - Ethel... Ethel, give her the money.\\
627 - Give her the money?\\
628 - Give her the money.\\

650 - And willingly I'll keep it\\
651 - Forever\\
652 - Forever, darling\\
653 - You will find me true\\
654 - Ever and ever\\

659 - Want to pick up the phone?\\
660 - Someone from the steamship company.\\
661 - Uh, thanks. Hello.\\
662 - Yes?\\
663 - Well, I-I guess we could play on the

679 - Oh, never mind.\\
680 - Did the raffle go all right?\\
681 - Yeah, it went all right, but we don't
care.\\
682 - No, we don't care.\\
683 - What canary did you two cats swallow?\\
684 - Shall I tell him?\\
685 - Go ahead.\\
686 - We raised the money for our trip to
Europe.\\
687 - And legitimately.\\
688 - How did you two clowns ever get ahold
of $3,000 legitimately?\\
689 - You think he's ready?\\
690 - Tell him.\\
691 - Well, I suddenly remembered that\\
692 - this building was in my name, so...\\
693 - I mortgaged it.\\
694 - Fred!\\
695 - Fred! Fred!\\
696 - Fred!\\

699 - Hey, honey, honey, I've got
wonderful...\\
700 - What's the matter?
What happened to Fred?\\
701 - Fred fainted.
Ethel told him\\
702 - that she mortgaged the building\\
703 - so we could go to Europe.\\
704 - Oh, you didn't have to do that.\\
705 - No?	Why not?\\
706 - Well, I thought I had to pay\\
707 - the passage for everyone in the band,\\
708 - but I found out about playing aboard
ship,\\
709 - I don't have to, so with the money I
save,\\
710 - you two can come along.\\
711 - You can take us for nothing?!\\
712 - Oh!	 (screaming)\\
713 - Fred!	    Hey, Fred!\\

1 - Hi, Lucy. What are you doing?\\
2 - Hi. Ethel, I have a schedule of all
the places\\
3 - the band's gonna play in Europe.\\
4 - Really?\\
5 - Our whole itinerary.	Yeah?\\
6 - Listen to this: London,
(gasps)\\
7 - Paris, Venice, Holland...\\
8 - ...the Riviera,     Oh!\\
9 - Madrid.\\
10 - Oh, my!\\
11 - I can't believe we're really going.\\
12 - Neither can I, but we're practically
on our way.\\
13 - Mother said she'd stay with the baby
while we were gone.\\
14 - Oh, aren't mothers wonderful?\\
15 - Aw, they sure are.\\
16 - She's taking an auto trip to New
England\\
17 - with a chum of hers,\\
18 - but she said she'd be here the day
before we leave.\\
19 - She's so cute.\\
20 - She said they had no idea where they
were going,\\
21 - but when they came to an
intersection,\\
22 - they were just gonna flip a coin.\\
23 - Ah, your mother.\\
24 - The coin won't be the only thing in
that car\\
25 - that's flipped.\\
26 - Hi.\\
27 - Hi.\\
28 - Ricky home yet?\\
29 - Not yet, no.
What's that?\\
30 - Fred!\\
31 - What are you doing with our old
vaudeville trunk?\\
32 - Well, as long as I'm Ricky's band
manager,\\
33 - it's my job to save him some money.\\
34 - So, I thought we could pack\\
35 - some of the band uniforms in here.\\
36 - Oh, but it's so old and beat-up,\\
37 - and it's even got a hole in it!\\
38 - "And it's even got a hole in it!"\\
39 - I defy anyone to find that hole\\
40 - with the naked eye.\\
41 - I said the naked eye, not two bony
fingers.\\
42 - Oh, he bought it from a man who had a
seal act.\\
43 - LUCY: Oh, fine.\\
44 - Hey, Fred, here's the schedule for
Europe. Look.\\
45 - First we go to London, then Paris...\\
46 - Ah, Paris.\\
47 - Get ready, you cute mademoiselles.\\
48 - Corporal Mertz is gonna make his
triumphant return.\\
49 - Fred, you were there 35 years ago.\\
50 - Yes, but I left a lasting impression.\\
51 - By the way, where's that old uniform
of mine?\\
52 - Now, you're not gonna try to put that
old thing on.\\
53 - I just want to see it; it's full of
memories.\\
54 - Hi, everybody.\\
55 - Hi.	      Hi.\\
56 - I got the boat tickets.\\
57 - Oh, no kidding!
The boat tickets!\\
58 - Now, all we got to do tomorrow\\
59 - is get our pass-a-ports.\\
60 - Yeah, that's all we got to do now is
get our "pass-a-ports."\\
61 - Europe, here we come!\\
62 - Look out, Mademoiselle from
Armentieres!\\
63 - Honey, did you get my naturalization
papers?\\
64 - Yeah, I got them out of the safe
deposit box this morning.\\
65 - How about your birth certificate?\\
66 - I wired the Jamestown Hall of
Records,\\
67 - and they'll send it to me.	Good.\\
68 - I got mine.\\
69 - Ethel?\\
70 - Yep. I had to hunt for it,\\
71 - but I finally found it.\\
72 - Show it to them, honey.\\
73 - No.\\
74 - She doesn't want us to see the year.\\
75 - Put your finger over the year.\\
76 - Thought they might like to see\\
77 - what Lincoln's signature looks like.\\
78 - Oh, Fred!\\
79 - (phone ringing)
Ha, ha!\\
80 - He-he-he-hee.\\
81 - The phone, honey.\\
82 - Oh. Hello...\\
83 - Hey, what's that trunk?\\
84 - Oh, that's my old vaudeville trunk.\\
85 - I thought we could pack the band
uniforms in there.\\
86 - Hello?\\
87 - Yes?\\
88 - Oh, uh, just a minute, please.\\
89 - Honey, it's a collect call for you\\
90 - from Jamestown Hall of Records.\\
91 - Oh, must be about my birth
certificate.\\
92 - Hello? Yes, I'll take the call.\\
93 - Hello?\\
94 - But there must be some mistake.\\
95 - Well, my maiden name was Lucille
McGillicuddy\\
96 - and I was born in Jamestown.\\
97 - Well, I'm positive.\\
98 - Well, I don't understand.\\
99 - Oh, well, you misunderstood me.\\
100 - Yes, you're looking under the wrong
year.\\
101 - Oh, yes, I was born in 19...\\
102 - I was born in 19...\\
103 - (mumbling)\\
104 - (muffled): 19...\\
105 - Look, you know the year you just
mentioned?\\
106 - Well, it's three more years than
that.\\
107 - No, no, no, not backwards, forwards.\\
108 - Yeah, I'll hang on.\\
109 - They were looking under the wrong
year.\\
110 - Really, honey? What year were they
looking under?\\
111 - 19...\\
112 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
113 - Yes?\\
114 - But there must be some mistake.\\
115 - Well, I...\\
116 - All right.\\
117 - Thank you.\\
118 - How do you like that?\\
119 - What's the matter, honey?\\
120 - They can't find my birth certificate.\\
121 - There's no record.\\
122 - Oh, there must be.\\
123 - Well, there isn't.\\
124 - If I'd known Jamestown\\
125 - was gonna be that careless,\\
126 - I'd have been born somewhere else.\\
127 - Well, honey, you-you-you need\\
128 - your birth certificate if you want to
get a passport.\\
129 - Well, what do you want me to do?\\
130 - They never heard of me.\\
131 - Maybe you were never born.\\
132 - I was, too.\\
133 - ETHEL: Now, Fred.\\
134 - I was only kidding her.\\
135 - 'Course you were born.\\
136 - Well, you know it and I know it,\\
137 - but as far as Jamestown is concerned,\\
138 - the stork just dropped me and didn't
tell anybody.\\
139 - Now, look, honey, why don't you call
your mother\\
140 - and ask her about it?\\
141 - (wailing)\\
142 - What's the matter?\\
143 - I don't know where my mother is.\\
144 - The whole family's disappearing\\
145 - right in front of our eyes.\\
146 - Well, mother is on an auto trip up in
New England or someplace.\\
147 - She won't be here until the day
before you leave.\\
148 - I'm not going to get to go to Europe
at all!\\
149 - Now, honey, let me see. I'll call the
pass-a-port office.\\
150 - I got their number right here.\\
151 - Bon voyage, everybody.\\
152 - Now, now, Lucy, it can't be that bad.\\
153 - You don't know what it's like to be
born a missing person.\\
154 - Hello?\\
155 - Pass-a-port office?\\
156 - Look. I'd like some information,
please.\\
157 - If you want to get a pass-a-port\\
158 - and you can't find your bir'
certificate, what do you do?\\
159 - Pass-a-port.\\
160 - Bir' certificate.\\
161 - Yes, yes, that's right.\\
162 - Uh-huh. What is it?\\
163 - You get an affidavit from an older
living blood relative.\\
164 - Suppose you misplace your older
living blood relative?\\
165 - Well, you don't know this family.\\
166 - Oh? I see.\\
167 - Oh, thank you very much.\\
168 - Honey, all you got to is find two old
friends of your family\\
169 - that remember who you were born\\
170 - and get an affidavit from them.\\
171 - Oh, that'll be easy.\\
172 - I do know a lot of people in
Jamestown.\\
173 - No, no. Wait a minute now.\\
174 - That name sounded familiar.\\
175 - No.\\
176 - You still on the phone?\\
177 - Who are you talking to?\\
178 - The Jamestown Hall of Records.\\
179 - Oh.	 Did you say Paul Jones?\\
180 - No.\\
181 - Richard Jones?\\
182 - No.\\
183 - Robert A. Jones?\\
184 - Bob Jones, Bob Jones. No.\\
185 - What are they doing, reading you the
whole directory?\\
186 - Yes.\\
187 - What?!\\
188 - Ah, uh, Mrs. Mell, I'll call you
back.\\
189 - You scared me.\\
190 - Are you crazy or something?\\
191 - That'll cost a fortune.\\
192 - Well, I'm desperate.\\
193 - I can't find a soul in Jamestown that
knew me when I was born.\\
194 - Now, look, honey, wasn't there a
doctor there\\
195 - when you were born?\\
196 - Yes. I called Dr. Peterson,\\
197 - but he's visiting here in New York.\\
198 - His daughter said she tried\\
199 - to get in touch with him and have him
call.\\
200 - Well, there you are.\\
201 - No, there I'm not.\\
202 - Even if he does call--\\
203 - there is a very good chance that he
won't--\\
204 - I still need one more witness.\\
205 - Well, you'll think of somebody, don't
worry.\\
206 - If I could just think of\\
207 - Helen Erickson's second husband's
name.\\
208 - Helen Erickson?\\
209 - Yeah. You don't know her.\\
210 - She's a girl who used to live next
door to us.\\
211 - She used to baby-sit me when my folks
wanted to go out.\\
212 - Well...\\
213 - Darn it. She lives here in New York
now, too.\\
214 - Well, I got to go to the club, honey.\\
215 - I'll see you later.\\
216 - Her first husband's name was Sears.\\
217 - You don't suppose her second
husband's name could be...\\
218 - No, I guess that's impossible.\\
219 - Hi, Rick.
Hi.\\
220 - Bye.
Bye.\\
221 - Lucy, has Fred been over here?\\
222 - No.\\
223 - Wonder where he is.\\
224 - Well, did you get your witnesses?\\
225 - No.\\
226 - FRED: ...Parlez-vous\\
227 - Mad'moiselle from Armentieres\\
228 - Parlez-vous\\
229 - Mad'moiselle from Armentieres\\
230 - She ain't been kissed in 40 years\\
231 - Hinky-dinky parlez-vous.\\
232 - Fred, what are you doing in that?\\
233 - I'm getting ready to burst upon Gay
Paree.\\
234 - Well, that's sure the outfit for it.\\
235 - So it needs a little letting out here
and there.\\
236 - Now, don't make fun of us doughboys.\\
237 - Dough boys?!\\
238 - Whoever put the dough in that boy
used too much yeast.\\
239 - It's a good thing that Kaiser didn't
see you in that outfit.\\
240 - He never would have surrendered.\\
241 - FRED: Is that so? Let me tell you
what...\\
242 - That's it!\\
243 - That's what?\\
244 - That's Helen's last name-- Kaiser.\\
245 - Helen married...
Sidney Kaiser.\\
246 - What are you talking about?\\
247 - Helen Kaiser is a girl who knew me
when I was a baby.\\
248 - She can sign one of the affidavits.\\
249 - Oh, that's great.\\
250 - Okay, Corporal, back to your
barracks.\\
251 - Hut, two, three, four!\\
252 - Hut, two, three, four!\\
253 - Hut, two, three, four!\\
254 - Mad'moiselle from Armentieres\\
255 - Parlez-vous\\
256 - Mad'moiselle from Armentieres\\
257 - Parlez-vous...\\
258 - Honey, you think she'll remember you?\\
259 - Sure. She was like a sister to me.\\
260 - (contented sigh): Oh...\\
261 - Hello? I'd like to speak to Helen
Kaiser, please.\\
262 - Oh, hi, Helen!\\
263 - This is Lucy Ricardo...\\
264 - I mean, Lucille McGillicuddy from
Jamestown.\\
265 - Lucille McGillicuddy.\\
266 - Used to live next door to you?\\
267 - Well, Helen, do you remember a little
skinny girl\\
268 - with freckles and red hair?\\
269 - Well, do you remember a little skinny
girl\\
270 - with freckles and brown hair?\\
271 - Well, you used to kid me about my
bloomers.\\
272 - They were alway...\\
273 - Yes! This is Droopy Drawers!\\
274 - Hi! Yeah, yeah, it's been a long
time, hasn't it?\\
275 - Well, I'll tell you why I called,
Helen.\\
276 - You see we're going to Europe\\
277 - and I can't find my birth
certificate,\\
278 - so I have to have someone sign an
affidavit\\
279 - saying they knew when and where I was
born.\\
280 - Would you, Helen?\\
281 - Oh, I'd appreciate it so much.\\
282 - Could I come over now?\\
283 - Oh, thank you. Okay, bye.\\
284 - She's gonna do it.\\
285 - I'm halfway to Europe.\\
286 - Oh, honey, that's wonderful.\\
287 - Listen, I'll be gone about an hour.\\
288 - Will you stay here until I get back?\\
289 - Why? The baby's in nursery school,
isn't he?\\
290 - In case Dr. Peterson calls.\\
291 - I don't want to miss him.\\
292 - Oh, okay.\\
293 - Okay. Bye.\\
294 - Good luck, Droopy Drawers.\\
295 - Oh, come now!\\
296 - Helen!\\
297 - Droopy Drawers!\\
298 - (laughing)\\
299 - Oh, it's so good to see you.\\
300 - You haven't changed a bit.\\
301 - Neither have you...\\
302 - (laughing): Well...\\
303 - Ah, yeah, I know.\\
304 - There have been a few color changes
here and there,\\
305 - and I'm wearing better-fitting
bloomers.\\
306 - (laughing)\\
307 - Oh, what a lovely apartment.\\
308 - Oh, thank you.\\
309 - You know, Lucy, ever since you
called,\\
310 - I've been thinking about the old days\\
311 - when we used to live in Jamestown.\\
312 - Those were the days, weren't they?\\
313 - Yeah.\\
314 - Lucy, do you remember the time\\
315 - your baby buggy got away from me?\\
316 - No.\\
317 - Well... well, you were only about a
year old.\\
318 - Oh, well, I guess that's why I don't
remember it.\\
319 - Oh.		(laughing)\\
320 - Well, anyway, I was pushing your
buggy,\\
321 - and I stopped for a minute to go into
a candy store.\\
322 - And when I came out,\\
323 - the buggy had rolled all the way down
the hill\\
324 - and was out in the middle of the
street stopping traffic!\\
325 - Oh, no!\\
326 - It's a wonder we ever grew up, isn't
it?\\
327 - Yes.\\
328 - Well, Helen, I'd just love\\
329 - to sit here all afternoon\\
330 - talking over old times with you,\\
331 - but I guess we'd better get this
affidavit signed.\\
332 - Oh, it's okay.\\
333 - I typed it all up,\\
334 - and it just says that you knew my
family\\
335 - for ages and ages\\
336 - and you remember when I was born.\\
337 - Oh, good.\\
338 - And you sign on the bottom line
there.\\
339 - Oh, fine.\\
340 - I have a pen Oh, good.
right here.\\
341 - LUCY: There you are.\\
342 - Hi, honey.\\
343 - Oh!\\
344 - Hello, Sidney.\\
345 - Oh...\\
346 - Hey...\\
347 - SIDNEY: Mmm...\\
348 - Darling, I want you to meet\\
349 - an old friend of mine, Lucy Ricardo.\\
350 - This is Sidney.\\
351 - Hello, Sidney.\\
352 - Very nice to meet you.\\
353 - Nice to know you, Lucy.\\
354 - Lucy and I grew up together in
Jamestown,\\
355 - and she came over to have me sign an
affidavit for her.\\
356 - Yes, I'm going to Europe.\\
357 - Well, it's the silliest thing.\\
358 - For some reason or other,\\
359 - there is just no record of my being
born in Jamestown,\\
360 - so I can't get my birth certificate.\\
361 - So, I have to have Helen swear\\
362 - that she remembers when I was born so
I can get my passport.\\
363 - You sign on the bottom line there,
dear.\\
364 - Okay.\\
365 - Well, now, wait a minute, Helen.\\
366 - You can't sign an affidavit just like
that.\\
367 - Well, why not?\\
368 - Yeah, why not?\\
369 - Well, an affidavit is sworn
testimony.\\
370 - It's... it's testimony taken under
oath.\\
371 - That'd have to be witnessed by a
notary public.\\
372 - Oh, I didn't know that.\\
373 - Well, I'll go get a notary public.\\
374 - Oh, no, no, no, that won't be
necessary.\\
375 - Helen and I can take it down to my
office.\\
376 - We'll have it notarized tomorrow and
mail it to you.\\
377 - Yeah, Sidney is an attorney.\\
378 - Well, how convenient having one right
in the family!\\
379 - They sure come in handy, don't they?\\
380 - Honey?\\
381 - Yes?\\
382 - You can't sign this at all.\\
383 - I can't?\\
384 - Says here, Lucy, you were born in
1921.\\
385 - That's right.\\
386 - (chuckling): Ah, honey,\\
387 - you always were poor in arithmetic.\\
388 - How old are you?\\
389 - 29.\\
390 - (Sidney chuckling)\\
391 - You'd have to have a pretty good
memory.\\
392 - You weren't even born until 1927.\\
393 - Oh. Oh, that's right!\\
394 - But, Helen...\\
395 - Oh, I thought that said 1931.\\
396 - Helen?\\
397 - Yes, dear?\\
398 - I... I don't want to contradict you
in front of Sidney,\\
399 - and I don't know how you did it\\
400 - if you were just born 29 years ago,\\
401 - but you were there when I was born.\\
402 - Lucy, that's impossible.\\
403 - But, uh, well, what about the baby
buggy?\\
404 - Who was pushing whom?\\
405 - Oh, oh, Daddy, you know, Lucy was a
regular little mother.\\
406 - She used to push me around when...\\
407 - (with baby talk): She pushed me
around\\
408 - when I was just a eensy-weensy little
baby in a buggy.\\
409 - Ew!\\
410 - Well, Lucy, it must be great\\
411 - for you two to see each other again.\\
412 - Tell me, has Helen changed much since
she was a little child?\\
413 - Not a bit.\\
414 - She just never seems to get any
older.\\
415 - I know what you mean.\\
416 - Ever since we've been married,\\
417 - she seems to be growing younger every
day.\\
418 - Yeah, I guess it's the marriage that
did it.\\
419 - You've no idea how much younger she's
grown\\
420 - just since you walked into the room.\\
421 - Lucy, we don't want to keep you.\\
422 - If you want to run along...\\
423 - Look, Helen, I really need this
affidavit.\\
424 - So, don't you think maybe you could
sign it\\
425 - just for the sake of all those years
that I baby-sat with you?\\
426 - But that'd be perjury.\\
427 - Lucy, you wouldn't want Helen to lie,
would you?\\
428 - Oh, heaven forbid!\\
429 - Lucy, I hope you have a nice time in
Europe.\\
430 - It was awfully nice to have met you,
Lucy.\\
431 - Yeah. Thanks.\\
432 - And maybe we'll see you soon?\\
433 - Oh, yes, you must come over for
dinner sometime\\
434 - and bring your mother.\\
435 - Hi, honey, Dr. Peterson called, and
he's coming right over.\\
436 - Swell.\\
437 - What's the matter?\\
438 - I'll still need another witness.\\
439 - Why? What happened with Helen Kaiser?\\
440 - Helen Kaiser is a dirty rat.\\
441 - She wouldn't sign the affidavit.\\
442 - Her husband walked into the room\\
443 - and suddenly she became younger than
I am.\\
444 - She wouldn't admit her real age.\\
445 - You're kidding.\\
446 - How do you like that?\\
447 - Oh, dear. What are you gonna do now?\\
448 - Well, I'll tell you one thing I'm not
going to do.\\
449 - I'm not going to let you three trot
off to Europe without me\\
450 - even if I have to stowaway.\\
451 - Oh, Lucy...\\
452 - You know, this is about the right
size at that.\\
453 - Oh, now, Lucy, not in that trunk!\\
454 - Why not?\\
455 - Well, how could you breathe?\\
456 - There's a hole in it.\\
457 - Yes, and it matches the one in your
head.\\
458 - Listen, if a seal could live in here,
I can.\\
459 - Oh, dear.\\
460 - I'm just gonna try it on for size.\\
461 - Oh, Lucy, this is absolutely
ridiculous!\\
462 - It's a nice thing to sort of have
around\\
463 - in case I can't get...\\
464 - Oh, honey...\\
465 - Now!\\
466 - I'm just gonna see if I fit in here.\\
467 - See? I fit like a glove.\\
468 - Yeah, but if the trunk was closed,\\
469 - you wouldn't last two minutes.\\
470 - Oh, I would, too.\\
471 - Go ahead, close it.
I'll show you.\\
472 - Okay, but just to convince you.\\
473 - Ethel, now, let me get my skirt out
of the way.\\
474 - Got it?\\
475 - Yep.\\
476 - Okay.\\
477 - How's that?\\
478 - (Lucy imitating seal barking)\\
479 - Oh, come on now, it's awful, isn't
it?\\
480 - No, it's very cozy in here.\\
481 - Cozy.\\
482 - It is! It's quite comfortable.\\
483 - We should all go to Europe this way
and save the fare.\\
484 - Sure, if you could get a whole bunch
of...\\
485 - Ethel, let me out of here.\\
486 - I thought so.\\
487 - Hey, it's locked.\\
488 - Wasn't there a key?\\
489 - Sure, there's a key.\\
490 - I got it.\\
491 - I got it?!\\
492 - Oh, now, don't get nervous, honey.\\
493 - Just poke it out through the hole\\
494 - and get you right out of there.\\
495 - Oh, okay.\\
496 - Oh. Oh!\\
497 - What's the matter?\\
498 - Ethel, th-the key's in my pocket\\
499 - and I can't move my arms!\\
500 - What?!\\
501 - My arms are pinned down to my side!\\
502 - Oh, Lucy, only you would get yourself
locked in a trunk\\
503 - with the key in your pocket.\\
504 - Oh, well, don't scold me.\\
505 - I got to get out of here.\\
506 - I don't want Ricky to come over\\
507 - and find out that I planned to
stowaway.\\
508 - Go get Fred.\\
509 - Okay, honey.\\
510 - Hurry up.
All right, I'll hurry.\\
511 - Now you wait right there!\\
512 - All right, I'll do that!\\
513 - Oh, uh...\\
514 - (shouting): Hello, Ricky!\\
515 - Hi, Ethel.
What's the matter?\\
516 - Oh, uh, uh, uh... you just startled
me, that's all.\\
517 - Where's Lucy?\\
518 - (stammering): Uh, uh, uh....\\
519 - Why?\\
520 - Why?\\
521 - Well, I'm married to her and I live
here.\\
522 - When I come home, I like to know
where she is, you know.\\
523 - Oh, of course you do.\\
524 - Well, you know Lucy.\\
525 - She's just liable to be anywhere.\\
526 - (forced laughter)\\
527 - ?Que pasa con ella?\\
528 - I don't know.\\
529 - Oye quiero ensenar la parte otra mas
del drum.\\
530 - Si.\\
531 - You need the music?\\
532 - No, no.
No?\\
533 - La... la parte es del final...\\
534 - La parte, si.\\
535 - La parte. All right.\\
536 - All right. Si.\\
537 - Hey, I'll try here on this thing. Go
ahead.\\
538 - Magnifique.\\
539 - (playing upbeat music)\\
540 - That's good.\\
541 - Now let's do double tempo here, you
know.\\
542 - Double tempo, huh.
Double tempo.\\
543 - That's good. Now the very end of
that.\\
544 - (imitating rapid drumbeat)\\
545 - You know?\\
546 - Here we go.\\
547 - (playing up-tempo music)\\
548 - Hey, hey, hey, hey!\\
549 - Now, that's the tempo we should do.\\
550 - How's that?\\
551 - Hey, this trunk has a pretty good
tone.\\
552 - Bueno Desi que yo...
tengo que ir.\\
553 - ?Tiene que ir?\\
554 - Va entrar el tiempo...\\
555 - Well, yo voy contigo ahi al subway.\\
556 - Tengo que comprar un evening paper.\\
557 - Oh, I thought they'd never leave.\\
558 - Lucy, I can't find Fred anywhere.\\
559 - Lucy?\\
560 - Lucy, are you all right?\\
561 - Somebody talking to me?\\
562 - Are you all right?\\
563 - Huh?\\
564 - Are you all right?\\
565 - I can't hear a thing.\\
566 - Ricky just beat out\\
567 - a concerto for piano and trunk.\\
568 - Oh, I heard it, you poor little
thing.\\
569 - (Doorbell buzzing)\\
570 - Don't bother.
I'll get it.\\
571 - Yes?\\
572 - Lucille McGillicuddy!\\
573 - My gosh, I'd know you anywhere.\\
574 - Oh, no, I'm not Lucille.\\
575 - I'm Ethel Mertz.\\
576 - (chuckling): Oh, I don't have my
glasses on.\\
577 - Oh, you must be Dr. Peterson.\\
578 - Yep.\\
579 - Hello, Doc.\\
580 - (gasps)\\
581 - Who said that?\\
582 - Lucy. She's in the trunk.\\
583 - Oh, hello, hello.\\
584 - Hello.\\
585 - Ethel, go get a notary public.\\
586 - Where'll I get a notary public?\\
587 - At the bank.\\
588 - Okay.\\
589 - Whup-up-up-up-up.\\
590 - I couldn't sign anything until I'm
sure\\
591 - that she's really Lucille...
McGillicuddy.\\
592 - Oh, no, I am, Dr. Peterson.\\
593 - I am. I'm Lucille McGillicuddy.\\
594 - Well, I don't know.\\
595 - Uh, I thought she was you at first.\\
596 - Oh, no, now, you could see her.\\
597 - There's a hole right there in the
trunk.\\
598 - You look right through there,\\
599 - you can see that that's Lucy.\\
600 - Well, I'll take a look.\\
601 - Hi.\\
602 - I can't tell a thing.\\
603 - Oh, now, wait a minute, Doc.\\
604 - Wait a minute.
Here's one of my eyes.\\
605 - Here's my other eye.\\
606 - Here's my nose.\\
607 - Here's my mouth.\\
608 - Put them all together\\
609 - and they spell Lucille McGillicuddy.\\
610 - All that is is an eye, an eye, a nose
and a mouth.\\
611 - I've seen so many.\\
612 - Oh...\\
613 - Well, I know.\\
614 - Listen, Doc, I-I was bitten by a cat
once on my ear\\
615 - and-and you took some stitches in it,
remember?\\
616 - Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep, that I
remember.\\
617 - It was Fred Bigelow's cat.\\
618 - Yeah, that's right.\\
619 - Well, look, maybe you can see the
scar.\\
620 - Ah... wait a minute.\\
621 - Scar or no scar, you couldn't be
Lucille McGillicuddy.\\
622 - She had brown hair.\\
623 - Look at the roots-- the roots!\\
624 - Oh, never mind, Ethel.\\
625 - It's no use.\\
626 - I'm never gonna get out of this trunk\\
627 - as long as I live.\\
628 - (crying)\\
629 - Don't cry, honey.\\
630 - It won't do any good.\\
631 - Goodness, no, don't cry.\\
632 - Ethel, I need a handkerchief.\\
633 - Oh, all right, honey.\\
634 - Here.	     (wailing)\\
635 - Aw, let me have your nose.\\
636 - Thank you.
Well, now,\\
637 - will you please go get Fred?\\
638 - Well, I'll try to find him again.\\
639 - I'll be right back, Dr. Peterson.\\
640 - Hurry up.\\
641 - Hey, young lady?\\
642 - I just remembered	What?\\
643 - how you can absolutely identify
yourself for me.\\
644 - How?\\
645 - Well, when you was a little girl,\\
646 - I taught you a song we sang together.\\
647 - Do you remember?\\
648 - Yes. Yes, I do!\\
649 - Well, if you can sing that song all
the way through with me,\\
650 - like you used to, you must be Lucille
McGillicuddy.\\
651 - Oh, I-I-I can. Just let me think a
minute.\\
652 - Oh... um... uh...\\
653 - Oh, yeah. Uh...

670 - What's going on here?\\
671 - I'm locked in the trunk, honey.\\
672 - This is Dr. Peterson from Jamestown.\\
673 - How do...
how do you do?\\
674 - How do you do?\\
675 - I'm the doctor who brought your wife
into the world.\\
676 - Oh, you are. Well, I don't know
whether\\
677 - to thank you or punch you in the
nose.\\
678 - Lucy, what are you doing in that
trunk?\\
679 - Oh, just packing a few things.\\
680 - ETHEL: Come on, Fred, hurry up.\\
681 - She's been in here so long, I got...\\
682 - Fred, hurry up.
Fred, hurry up.\\
683 - Well, now, wait a minute.\\
684 - What do you mean, wait a minute?\\
685 - Well, maybe we can do this\\
686 - without damaging the trunk.\\
687 - ETHEL: Oh, Ricky, help him.\\
688 - She was in there when you were
beating on the top.\\
689 - Oh, hurry up.\\
690 - Wait a minute.
Hurry up.\\
691 - Look out for your hand, Fred.\\
692 - Is it coming?
Is it coming?\\
693 - Yes.\\
694 - ETHEL: Oh, are you all right, honey?\\
695 - Are you all right?
There you go.\\
696 - Got it.\\
697 - RICKY: Okay.\\
698 - There you go.\\
699 - Oh, honey!\\
700 - Are you all right?\\
701 - Oh, was it awful?\\
702 - Well, it's a nice place to visit--\\
703 - I wouldn't want to live there.\\
704 - Hiya, Doc.\\
705 - Lucy McGillicuddy!\\
706 - I thought you'd be bigger by now.\\
707 - RICKY: Will somebody mind telling me
what's going on here?\\
708 - Why? You'll never believe it.\\
709 - Well, now... I...\\
710 - Whoa.\\
711 - Thanks, Doc.\\
712 - I, uh...\\
713 - I just figured maybe\\
714 - I'd have to stowaway if I want to get
to Europe,\\
715 - and I... I knew that a seal could
live in there,\\
716 - so I supposed maybe I could,\\
717 - and when I tried it on for size, I
got locked in it.\\
718 - What makes you think I wouldn't
believe that?\\
719 - Oh, Doc, have you any idea why there
is no record\\
720 - of my being born in Jamestown?\\
721 - Jamestown? You weren't born in
Jamestown.\\
722 - What?\\
723 - You were born in West Jamestown.\\
724 - (doorbell buzzing)
Oh...\\
725 - West Jamestown!
West Jamestown!\\
726 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
727 - You don't know what I've gone
through.\\
728 - I didn't even know there was a West
Jamestown.\\
729 - Honey, it's a special delivery letter
there for you.\\
730 - H-Honestly, Doc, you don't know\\
731 - How do you like that?
what we've gone through.\\
732 - We've been calling the Hall of
Records for one solid...\\
733 - Oh, it's from Mother.
What'd she say?\\
734 - "We had car trouble and got stuck
overnight\\
735 - "in West Jamestown, so I picked this
up.\\
736 - Hope you can use it."\\

26 - Well, I haven't learned how to\\
27 - say "Fred" and "Ethel" in French.\\
28 - How do you say "seasick" in French?\\
29 - Oh, will you stop harping on that.\\
30 - LUCY: What's wrong?\\
31 - He's afraid he's gonna get seasick on
the boat.\\
32 - Oh, Fred, that's silly.\\
33 - It is not.\\
34 - You were on a boat when you went to
France\\
35 - during the First World War, weren't
you?\\
36 - Yeah, but believe me, it wasn't my
idea.\\
37 - And you came back on a boat, too,
didn't you?\\
38 - Only because my top sergeant\\
39 - had a bayonet in my back.\\
40 - Oh, Fred.\\
41 - Look, it's different nowadays on
these big ocean liners.\\
42 - the Constitution, one of the best.\\
43 - Sure. It's all in your mind.\\
44 - Just don't think about it.\\
45 - You'll be all right.\\
46 - Well...\\
47 - This is a terrible time to get a case
of jitters.\\
48 - We've made all the arrangements.\\
49 - We've sat for our passport photos.\\
50 - We've had our overseas shots.\\
51 - Okay, okay.\\
52 - But I still wish there was a way\\
53 - of getting to Europe by bus!\\
54 - Fred, don't forget we're depending on
you\\
55 - to be our guide in Germany.\\
56 - Have you been studying your German?\\
57 - Ja wohl, fraulein.\\
58 - Hey, that's wonderful.\\
59 - Giemen a sie, me a...
ein stein Wurzburger.\\
60 - Oh, great!
What does that mean?\\
61 - What do you think it means?\\
62 - "Give me a glass of beer."\\
63 - Is that all he's learned?\\
64 - Nope. He's learned how to order nine
different kinds of beer.\\
65 - Oh, we're gonna have an interesting
time in Germany.\\
66 - Never mind, now.\\
67 - You're not doing so hot with your
Italian.\\
68 - Is that so?\\
69 - By the time we get to Italy,\\
70 - you won't be able to tell me from
Gina Lollobrigida.\\
71 - Well, gieben sie me a Gina
Lollobrigida.\\
72 - Oh, shuttenze up.\\
73 - How are you doing with your French,
honey?\\
74 - Fine. I've mastered the two most
important sentences\\
75 - in the language.\\
76 - What were they?\\
77 - "How much is that dress in the
window?"\\
78 - And "Wrap it up.
I'll take it."\\
79 - Well, I have a feeling that Ricky
will know the French\\
80 - for "Take it back.
It's too expensive."\\
81 - Yeah.
I'll bet he does.\\
82 - Hi.\\
83 - Hi, Honey.	    Hello, Rick.\\
84 - Hey, I got our pass-a-port pictures.\\
85 - Oh, passport pictures!\\
86 - Let me	    Let's see mine.   see
'em.\\
87 - Look pretty good.\\
88 - Every one except mine.\\
89 - Yeah?\\
90 - Let me see yours, hon.\\
91 - Hey, that's pretty good of you.\\
92 - That's you.\\
93 - Me?\\
94 - Here, oh, oh, look, this is you.\\
95 - I got them all mixed up.
Give me me.\\
96 - Here, honey, this is you.\\
97 - I guess this is yours.\\
98 - (screaming)   (screaming)\\
99 - I look like Frankenstein.\\
100 - Well, shake hands with your bride.\\
101 - Let me see that one of you.\\
102 - Hey, that looks more like me than the
one of me does.\\
103 - You want to trade?\\
104 - Fred, let me see yours.\\
105 - Yeah.\\
106 - I don't think that's very bad, do
you?\\
107 - No, that's not so bad.\\
108 - That's very realistic.\\
109 - I look like a fist with eyes.\\
110 - You're the one that got the good one.\\
111 - Mm...\\
112 - Yeah, that's not bad, Ethel.\\
113 - I think he's captured the real you.\\
114 - Is that so?\\
115 - If I thought I really looked like
this,\\
116 - I wouldn't blame Fred if he walked
out on me\\
117 - right this minute.\\
118 - Good-bye!\\
119 - Come back here.\\
120 - Let me see yours, Ricky.\\
121 - Oh, it's terrible.\\
122 - Oh, I think that's pretty cute.\\
123 - Honey, that's good.\\
124 - I look all right, but my hair looks
so funny.\\
125 - What's the matter with it?\\
126 - I look like I had a head full of
chocolate fudge.\\
127 - (chuckling): Chocolate fudge.\\
128 - Well, now that we've all looked at
each other's pictures...\\
129 - Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.\\
130 - Come on now, come on.\\
131 - Yeah, let's see yours.\\
132 - Oh, now, you don't want to see them.\\
133 - Come on now.\\
134 - (sighing)\\
135 - Why, honey, I think that's pretty
cute.\\
136 - That's not bad.\\
137 - Oh, it's terrible.\\
138 - Looks like my face was put on hot and
it ran.\\
139 - Well, that's the way the pictures
came out.\\
140 - So what are you going to do about it?\\
141 - I know what I'm going to do.\\
142 - I'm going to find another
photographer\\
143 - and have some more pictures made
right now.\\
144 - So am I.\\
145 - Good.\\
146 - I'll go put on a new face.\\
147 - Just a minute. You mean you've had a
new face\\
148 - at home all this time and you're
still wearing that one?\\
149 - Oh, Fred!\\
150 - Hey, listen.\\
151 - We really should go and get our
pass-a-ports this morning.\\
152 - Well, you and Fred go.\\
153 - We want to get some decent pictures.\\
154 - Absolutely.
Well...\\
155 - And, honey, don't worry about the
baby.\\
156 - I'm gonna leave him at nursery school
all day.\\
157 - All right.
I'll see you later.\\
158 - Right.\\
159 - Feminine vanity.\\
160 - Yeah.\\
161 - What's the difference\\
162 - what your pass-a-port picture looks
like?\\
163 - I'm gonna use this thing right here.\\
164 - Let me see.\\
165 - I think I'll use this, too.\\
166 - (snickering)\\
167 - No, I guess I'd better use my own.\\
168 - I look so much better than this
picture,\\
169 - it'll give them a thrill just to see
me in person.\\
170 - (phone ringing)\\
171 - Hello?\\
172 - Oh, hello, Mr. Emory.\\
173 - Yes... well, we have to go down to
the pass-a-port office.\\
174 - That's down your way, so we'll stop
by.\\
175 - Sure, we'd love to see you.\\
176 - Thank you.\\
177 - That's Mr. Emory of the American
Export Line.\\
178 - He wants us to go down to the boat,
and he'll show us\\
179 - where the boys are gonna play\\
180 - and, uh, the accommodations and
stuff.\\
181 - Well, let's away!\\
182 - Okay.\\
183 - Well, it's no use, Ethel.\\
184 - Well, you'd think with your own
photographer\\
185 - and 50 different poses apiece,\\
186 - we would have gotten at least one
good picture.\\
187 - I just don't understand it.\\
188 - This is the same photographer\\
189 - that took our wedding pictures 15
years ago\\
190 - and we looked great.\\
191 - Well, I guess they're just not making
cameras\\
192 - like they used to.\\
193 - Hey, I just had a horrible thought.\\
194 - What?\\
195 - Maybe we really look like this.\\
196 - Bite your tongue.\\
197 - Well, what are we gonna do now?\\
198 - Well, either find another
photographer\\
199 - or a plastic surgeon.\\
200 - You'll be all right.
Don't worry.\\
201 - LUCY: What's the matter with Fred?\\
202 - What's the matter with Fred, Ricky?\\
203 - What's the matter with him?	     
    Well...\\
204 - I'll tell you what happened.\\
205 - We went down to the SS Constitution.\\
206 - Oh, no.\\
207 - Now, Fred, don't tell me you got
seasick.\\
208 - It was 1918 all over again.\\
209 - Well, honey, was it rough?\\
210 - Rough?\\
211 - The boat was tied to the dock.\\
212 - It was absolutely still.\\
213 - Fred, it's impossible to get seasick
on a boat\\
214 - that is standing still.\\
215 - Tell that to my stomach.\\
216 - Well, Fred, if you're gonna get
seasick on a boat\\
217 - that's tied to the dock,\\
218 - what are you gonna do when you get in
the middle of the ocean?\\
219 - Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna
do:\\
220 - I'm not going.\\
221 - Oh, Fred, you don't mean that.\\
222 - Ethel, there's no way to get me on
that boat.\\
223 - Where can I buy a bayonet?\\
224 - Now, Fred, you'll be all right once
we get underway.\\
225 - I'm not going.\\
226 - You've got to go.\\
227 - You're the band manager.\\
228 - I'm sorry, I get seasick.\\
229 - If I miss this trip on account of
you,\\
230 - I'll make you landsick.\\
231 - What a horrible choice to have to
make.\\
232 - Now, look, what's the matter with
everyone?\\
233 - What about those new, wonderful,
seasick pills\\
234 - that they have now?\\
235 - ETHEL: Sure!
They work great.\\
236 - Well...\\
237 - Oh, come on, Fred.\\
238 - Say you'll go.\\
239 - What have you got to lose?\\
240 - Don't ask me that right now.\\
241 - Did you have to say that?\\
242 - No, Fred, really, those pills will
work great.\\
243 - Well, suppose they don't!\\
244 - Well, take some and try it.\\
245 - Now, take some pills and go for a
ride\\
246 - on the Staten Island Ferry.\\
247 - Yeah.\\
248 - Will you go with me?\\
249 - I'm not gonna face the raging seas\\
250 - of New York Harbor alone.\\
251 - Sure I will, honey.\\
252 - I'm gonna be busy this afternoon,\\
253 - but tomorrow morning, we'll get up...\\
254 - Hey, listen, you got... you-you...\\
255 - This afternoon you gotta go get your
passports.\\
256 - We do?\\
257 - Yes. We were just down there.\\
258 - The man says that you had-- this the
last day\\
259 - if you want to be in time to sail.\\
260 - What time does the office close?\\
261 - 5:00.\\
262 - Oh, dear, I gotta go over\\
263 - and get Aunt Martha's luggage for the
trip.\\
264 - Lucy, will you baby-sit with
Commodore Squeamish here\\
265 - on the Staten Island Ferry?\\
266 - Sure.\\
267 - Okay, I'll see you at the passport
office.\\
268 - All right.
Come on, Fred.\\
269 - Oh, Ethel!
What?\\
270 - We don't have any decent pictures.\\
271 - Hey, here's two good ones, right
here.\\
272 - How can you say these are good?\\
273 - Because either you use these, or you
don't go.\\
274 - Oh, well, by George, these are kind
of good.\\
275 - Oh, I must admit that one...\\
276 - Oh, this is really good.\\
277 - I'll see you at the passport office,
honey.\\
278 - Yeah, come on, Fred.
Come on.\\
279 - Listen, you can buy those pills in
any drugstore.\\
280 - They'll work great.\\
281 - Well, if they don't,\\
282 - you can wave good-bye to me now,\\
283 - because they'll never get me off of
Staten Island.\\
284 - Oh, Fred, you're gonna take those
pills\\
285 - and you're gonna be all right.\\
286 - You just relax now, Fred.\\
287 - Those pills are gonna work great.\\
288 - Yeah, you know, I think they've
commenced to work already.\\
289 - Really?\\
290 - Yeah. I'm not seasick.\\
291 - Good.\\
292 - I'm not one bit seasick.\\
293 - I feel great!\\
294 - I-I never felt better in my life.\\
295 - I'm not seasick.\\
296 - Okay, boy, okay, wait till the boat
leaves.\\
297 - Yeah.\\
298 - (yawning)\\
299 - Gee, those pills sure relax you.\\
300 - They do, huh?	    Yeah.\\
301 - (steamship horn blaring)\\
302 - (engine roaring)\\
303 - You can let go now, Fred.\\
304 - Fred, let go.\\
305 - Come on, straighten up. Relax.\\
306 - Take your hands off.\\
307 - Attaboy. Relax, now, relax.\\
308 - There. How do you feel?\\
309 - Oh, I feel fine.\\
310 - Well, you don't look fine.\\
311 - Come on, smile.\\
312 - Aah, I don't want to jinx it.\\
313 - Aw, come on. Come on, boy, smile for
me.\\
314 - Attaboy, attaboy. There.\\
315 - You're not gonna mind this trip at
all.\\
316 - Nope.\\
317 - No.\\
318 - (yawning)\\
319 - Gee, look at all those whitecaps out
there.\\
320 - Yeah.\\
321 - Real wavy and choppy, isn't it?\\
322 - Yeah.\\
323 - Up we go and down we go\\
324 - and up we go\\
325 - and down...\\
326 - Gee, you feel fine, don't you, Fred?\\
327 - Yeah.\\
328 - Up we go and down we go and...\\
329 - You're not going to mind this trip at
all, Fred?\\
330 - Nope.\\
331 - All you have to do is take a big,
deep breath of fresh air.\\
332 - (taking deep breath)\\
333 - Nothing like the ocean air to pep you
up\\
334 - and make you ship-shape.\\
335 - Yeah.\\
336 - Oh...\\
337 - What's the matter?\\
338 - Nothing.\\
339 - Now, you don't have to pretend with
me.\\
340 - I've been on the other side of that
green face.\\
341 - No, really, I...
I feel... oh...\\
342 - Oh, now, steady, honey, steady.\\
343 - It's all in your mind.\\
344 - Never mind your philosophy.\\
345 - Just give me some of your pills.\\
346 - Oh. Yeah.\\
347 - Here.\\
348 - (ragged breathing)\\
349 - I only took two of those.\\
350 - Oh, I only took five or six.\\
351 - This is an emergency.\\
352 - Now, don't take any more.\\
353 - They make you awful sleepy.\\
354 - Yeah, well, I don't care what they do\\
355 - just so long as they settle...\\
356 - Oh...
Hold on!\\
357 - Honey, steady, steady. Hon...\\
358 - Come on, honey, let's go over and sit
down.\\
359 - I think I'd better stay right over
here.\\
360 - Let's sit down.\\
361 - Come on!\\
362 - There.\\
363 - Don't you feel any better?\\
364 - Well, I don't feel any worse.\\
365 - So, compared to the way I was
feeling, I...\\
366 - I'm feeling better, yeah.\\
367 - Yeah.\\
368 - Well, I-I guess I'm gonna get to make
that trip\\
369 - to Europe after all.\\
370 - Yeah, well, have a good time.\\
371 - (snoring)\\
372 - (ferry horn blaring)\\
373 - (snoring)\\
374 - Yeah?\\
375 - Yeah?\\
376 - Well, it's 4:15 already.\\
377 - Hasn't Lucy even called?\\
378 - I haven't heard a word from her.\\
379 - I can't even get my own passport.\\
380 - Somebody has to identify me.\\
381 - Look, I'll right come down there and
identify you.\\
382 - What do you think could have happened
to Lucy and Fred?\\
383 - I don't know, unless the seasick
pills didn't work\\
384 - and she can't get Fred off of Staten
Island.\\
385 - RICKY: Now, I'll be right down.\\
386 - Okay, thanks.\\
387 - Bye.
Bye.\\
388 - Come on, sir. You've got to wake up.\\
389 - Wake up, sir.\\
390 - Come on.
Up you go.\\
391 - Huh? Huh?\\
392 - Wake up.\\
393 - Ethel, all right, all right.\\
394 - All right, Ethel, I'm awake!\\
395 - Come on, sir.\\
396 - Huh?
I am sorry,\\
397 - but you and your friend have got to
get off.\\
398 - Well, where are we?\\
399 - New York.\\
400 - Well, we must have had a nice trip.\\
401 - Yeah. You had five nice trips.\\
402 - What?!\\
403 - Yes. I woke you up after the first
trip,\\
404 - and you said you and your friend
wanted to sleep.\\
405 - Oh, boy, you must have really tied
one on.\\
406 - Now, wait a minute.
You never woke me up.\\
407 - I did. You gave me a dollar.\\
408 - Well, the dollar's up-- five trips.\\
409 - Well, what time is it?\\
410 - Oh, it's about... 4:22.\\
411 - 4:2...\\
412 - Holy cow!\\
413 - 4:2..?\\
414 - Lucy!\\
415 - Lucy, honey, you got to wake up.\\
416 - Huh?\\
417 - You've got to wake up, honey right
now. Wake...\\
418 - You've got to wake up, honey. I...\\
419 - You've got to wake up.\\
420 - We gotta get off of this tub.
Huh?\\
421 - We gotta get your passport.\\
422 - Passport?
Yes.\\
423 - If we don't get off of this boat,\\
424 - you'll never get to Paris.\\
425 - Paris?
Yeah.\\
426 - Where are the dress shops?\\
427 - Down there!\\
428 - No, no, honey, this way.\\
429 - This way. There.\\
430 - That's right.\\
431 - No, honey! No!\\
432 - That way. There.\\
433 - There. That's right.\\
434 - Back that way.\\
435 - Honey, come here!\\
436 - No!\\
437 - This way!\\
438 - Now. Now, straight ahead.\\
439 - There. There.\\
440 - That's right.
That's right.\\
441 - Well, madam, it looks like your
friend didn't make it.\\
442 - Oh, now, she'll make it.\\
443 - We've still got eight minutes.\\
444 - Seven minutes. This office closes
promptly at 5:00.\\
445 - Oh, but we have to have our passports
today.\\
446 - Rules are rules.\\
447 - Well, it wouldn't hurt you to stay
open a few extra minutes,\\
448 - would it?\\
449 - When the 5:00 whistle blows, so do I.\\
450 - I am not leaving this office until I
get my passport.\\
451 - This office closes at 5:00\\
452 - if I have to eject you forcibly.\\
453 - You just try it.\\
454 - I'm a tax-paying citizen.\\
455 - I'll report you to Washington,\\
456 - and then you see how long you hold
this job.\\
457 - This is a civil service job.\\
458 - You want to get me fired, you'll have
to wait till I die.\\
459 - Ohh!\\
460 - Come on now, honey.\\
461 - Where have you been?\\
462 - You know the office cl....\\
463 - Fred, what's the matter with her?\\
464 - Well, she got seasick and took a mess
of those pills\\
465 - and got a little drowsy.\\
466 - A little drowsy?\\
467 - I was sleeping, too, and before we
woke up,\\
468 - we'd been to Staten Island five
times.\\
469 - You see that clock?\\
470 - You've got exactly six minutes left.\\
471 - Six minutes!\\
472 - Okay, okay. Now, I've made up all the
papers.\\
473 - All she has to do is sign them and be
sworn in.\\
474 - And identify you.\\
475 - I'll identify her.
I'm her husband.\\
476 - Oh, that's too bad.\\
477 - Well, you don't have to rub it in.\\
478 - I mean, she can't be identified by a
relative.\\
479 - Oh, well, she'll identify me.\\
480 - Well, madam, can you ident...?\\
481 - Are we keeping her up?\\
482 - Lucy, Lucy, wake up.\\
483 - I'm awake.\\
484 - Okay.\\
485 - Lucy, come on now.\\
486 - You have to wake up, honey.\\
487 - Wake up! Wake up!\\
488 - Fred, sit down.\\
489 - You're rocking the boat.\\
490 - Can you identify this woman\\
491 - as Ethel Mertz?\\
492 - Yeah, that's Ethel.\\
493 - Not me, honey, her.\\
494 - Can you identify this woman?\\
495 - Oh, what woman?\\
496 - Oh, I'll get a little water.\\
497 - She'll be all right.\\
498 - She's taking a little nap.\\
499 - Looks to me like she's taken a little
nip.\\
500 - Here you are, honey.\\
501 - Oh, Fred,\\
502 - I'm sorry.\\
503 - What did you do that for?\\
504 - Oh, I-I couldn't help it.\\
505 - Lucy, come on now, wake up. Wake up.\\
506 - I got to get my passport.\\
507 - Honey, you're here, right here now.
Come on now.\\
508 - Madam, can you identify this woman as
Ethel Mertz?\\
509 - Huh?\\
510 - Oh, hi, Ethel.\\
511 - Oh, thank you, Lucy.\\
512 - You got a passport photo?\\
513 - Yes, sir.\\
514 - Now don't laugh.\\
515 - Madam, I've been looking at...
at passport photos all my life.\\
516 - There's never one that's made me...\\
517 - Hee-hee-hee-hee.\\
518 - (chuckling)\\
519 - Okay. Okay, let's get on with it,
shall we?\\
520 - Yeah, just sign your photo.\\
521 - All right.\\
522 - Now, do you solemnly swear that the
statement made\\
523 - on your passport application is true,\\
524 - that the photograph attached to the
likeness of you?\\
525 - Do you further solemnly swear that
you will support\\
526 - and defend the Constitution of the
United States\\
527 - against all enemies, foreign and
domestic,\\
528 - that you will bear true faith and
allegiance\\
529 - to the same, that you take this
obligation freely\\
530 - without mental reservation\\
531 - or purpose of evasion, so help you.\\
532 - If so, raise your right hand and say,
"I do."\\
533 - I do.\\
534 - (laughing): Now...\\
535 - You'll have your passport in a week.\\
536 - Okay. Now, what about her?\\
537 - Well, we haven't got time for her.\\
538 - Oh, yes, we have. We've got
four-and-a-half minutes.\\
539 - Come on, now, Lucy.
You'll have to wake up.\\
540 - Come on, honey, come on.
Okay, let's go.\\
541 - Do you identify this woman as Mrs.
Lucille Ricardo?\\

She got seasick\\

seasick.\\
551 - What is she taking pills for?\\
552 - She made me look like Admiral Nimitz.\\
553 - You have exactly four minutes left.\\

paper.\\
616 - She can't take the oath being sleep.\\
617 - Well, you can't wake her up.\\
618 - We haven't got time.\\
619 - Well, if we don't have time to wake
her up,\\
620 - she's gonna have to stay home.\\

6 - Huh?\\
7 - What did you say, Mother?\\

9 - No! Come on. You can come on the
boat.\\
10 - Sure.\\
11 - WOMAN: Oh, bye!\\
12 - ETHEL: Good-bye!\\
13 - (crowd murmuring)\\
14 - This is ours, right?\\
15 - Oh, honey, look at the beautiful
stateroom!\\
16 - RICKY: Hey, how about this, huh?\\
17 - Look at the things everybody sent us.\\
18 - Yeah.\\
19 - Oh, look at this extravaganza.\\
20 - "Bon voyage from Billy, Danny and
little Jerry Asher."\\
21 - Ha, ha! Isn't that nice?\\
22 - Oh, gosh. What a boat this is!\\
23 - It has a ballroom, a theater, some
shops and even elevators!\\
24 - I know. Isn't it great?\\
25 - It's just like a big hotel\\
26 - floating along on the waves.\\
27 - Oh, that reminds me, Lucy.\\
28 - I brought the bottle of...
of seasick pills you wanted.\\
29 - Oh, thank you, Mother.\\
30 - RICKY: Oh...\\
31 - You won't need those.\\
32 - Well, I know, but my stomach will
rest easier\\
33 - if my mind knows they're here.\\
34 - Uh, Mrs. Ricardo?\\
35 - Yes, dear?\\
36 - I wonder if you'd do me a little
favor\\
37 - while you're in Paris.\\
38 - Well, of course, I will, Mrs.
Trumbull. What is it?\\
39 - Will you buy me a bottle of French
perfume?\\
40 - You know I will, but it'll be a
present from us.\\
41 - Oh, no.\\
42 - (chuckling)\\
43 - (whispering)\\
44 - My Sin?!\\
45 - Oh...\\
46 - (laughing)\\
47 - Now, Lucy, I want you to just enjoy
yourself\\
48 - and don't worry about a thing.\\
49 - Oh, I can't see Lucy not worrying
about the baby.\\
50 - Well, I'll relax if you promise to
cable me if he even sneezes.\\
51 - What are you gonna do, cable back
"gesundheit"?\\
52 - Well, I just want to know, that's
all.\\
53 - Oh, we have a phone!\\
54 - You can call me every day.\\
55 - Oh, I can't call you when you're at
sea.\\
56 - Oh, yes, you can, but it's pretty
expensive.\\
57 - Well, make it station-to-station.\\
58 - That way, it'll be cheaper.\\
59 - And I know I'm... I'm always gonna be
home.\\
60 - What's the number?\\
61 - There's no number, Mother.\\
62 - You call the marine operator and ask
for the Constitution.\\
63 - But let me put it this way: Don't
call us, we'll call you.\\
64 - Well, maybe not for just a sneeze,\\
65 - but anything important, huh, Mom?\\
66 - Okay, okay.\\
67 - MAN: All ashore that's going ashore.\\
68 - Oh, dear.
Uh-oh.\\
69 - Let me kiss him good-bye.
Come on, son.\\
70 - Give us a kiss good-bye, honey.\\
71 - Good-bye?
Good-bye?\\
72 - Where's everybody going?\\
73 - Huh?
Where's everybody going?\\
74 - Well, the man says all ashore who's
going ashore.\\
75 - Oh, they start that long before you
have to get off.\\
76 - Oh. Honey, he said they start that\\
77 - long before they have to get off.\\
78 - Oh, well, good, that'll give me\\
79 - a few more minutes with the baby,
then.\\
80 - Say, how do you like your stateroom?\\
81 - Oh, it's just gorgeous!\\
82 - It's just right down the hall.\\
83 - Band manager reporting, sir.\\
84 - All members present and accounted
for.\\
85 - At ease, Mr. Manayer.\\
86 - Ah, did you hear that, honey?\\
87 - Your papa has a band "manayer."\\
88 - (laughing)\\
89 - For heaven's sake, Ethel, can't you
wait?\\
90 - You've been spoiling the looks of the
basket.\\
91 - Oh, I can't help it.\\
92 - This sea air makes me hungry.\\
93 - We haven't even left the dock.\\
94 - (muffled): Well, we haven't even left
the dock.\\
95 - Wait till she finds out the food's
free.\\
96 - Could be the biggest bundle Britain's
ever seen.\\
97 - MAN: All ashore that's going ashore.\\
98 - Uh-oh, I think this is it, honey.\\
99 - We'd better go.\\
100 - We'd better go now.\\
101 - Oh, come on, dear...\\
102 - All right.\\
103 - Good-bye, son.\\
104 - Good-bye. Aw, I hate to see him go.\\
105 - It's all right, honey.\\
106 - Aw, good-bye.\\
107 - Honey, we can say good-bye from the
deck.\\
108 - We can wave from the deck.\\
109 - We'll wave good-bye from the deck.\\
110 - All right, we'll wave from the deck.\\
111 - Oh, good-bye, Mrs. Trumbull!\\
112 - All right, good-bye, Little Ricky!\\
113 - Good-bye, honey!\\
114 - Good-bye, sweetheart!\\
115 - Good-bye, honey!\\
116 - Hey, who are you waving at?\\
117 - That tall blonde down there.\\
118 - You don't know her.\\
119 - Well, I can dream, can't I?\\

137 - What's the matter, honey?\\
138 - I miss the baby.\\
139 - Oh... now, it's not gonna be for very
long.\\
140 - I just gotta give him one more kiss.\\
141 - Lucy, you'd better hurry,\\
142 - 'cause we're gonna take off in just a
few minutes.\\
143 - Hurry, hon!\\
144 - MRS. McGILLICUDDY: Bye! Good-bye!\\

166 - What are you doing down here?\\
167 - Oh, I just had to give him one more
hug.\\
168 - Now, stop being silly, you'll miss
The boat.\\
169 - Oh, you don't know what it's like to
be a mother, Mother.\\

baby.\\
171 - Now, you be a good little angel\\
172 - and I'll bring you lots of things
from Europe, honey.\\
173 - I'm not worrying about him, dear.\\

that's all.\\
175 - Give me a kiss, sweetheart.\\
176 - Give me a kiss.
Oh! Oh!\\
177 - Sorry, lady.\\
178 - Oh, my skirt is caught.\\

217 - Hey, wait a minute!\\
218 - Where do you think you're going?\\
219 - I've got to get on this boat.\\
220 - Not with my bike, you don't.\\
221 - Oh, after all, this is just a
bicycle,\\
222 - for heaven's sake.
I can't miss the boat.\\
223 - This bike is more important to me
than that boat.\\
224 - (horn blaring)
Oh...\\
225 - Stop the boat!\\
226 - Oh! Have you got a knife?\\
227 - No, but here's a pencil.\\

244 - Yeah, honey?
Do something!\\
245 - I'll do something.\\
246 - Turn the boat around.\\
247 - Ricky! Ricky!\\
248 - Yeah, honey?
Do something!\\
249 - I'll do something, honey!\\
250 - Turn the boat around!\\
251 - Oh, God!\\
252 - Mother, they sailed without me.\\
253 - The boat went without me, Mother!\\
254 - There must be something we can do.\\
255 - Somebody will think of something,
Lucy.\\
256 - Officer! Officer! Officer, my wife is
on the docks!\\
257 - Stop the ship!\\
258 - Well, now, that's impossible, sir.\\
259 - But-but look...\\
260 - Everything's gonna be all right, sir.\\
261 - She can come out on the pilot boat\\
262 - and come aboard when the pilot gets
off.\\
263 - Oh, you can come on the pilot boat!\\
264 - Wait a minute.
What?\\
265 - Come out on the pilot boat, honey!\\
266 - On the pilot...
She can't hear me.\\
267 - You can telephone the dock agent.
He'll page her.\\
268 - Oh, okay.\\
269 - Ricky's gonna call somebody to help
you!\\
270 - Oh...
Oh, these things happen.\\

the dock agent's desk.\\
283 - I'm Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.\\
284 - It's for you.\\
285 - Oh, thank you.
Hello?\\
286 - Honey, this is Ricky!\\
287 - Oh, Ricky...\\
288 - Now, honey, get-get ahold of
yourself.\\
289 - I missed the boat.\\
290 - I'm not gonna be able to go to Europe
at all.\\
291 - Now, honey, listen to me.\\
292 - Ricky...
Lis...\\
293 - Oh, Ricky...
Honey, you can...\\
294 - Honey, you can come out on the pilot
boat.\\
295 - I can come out on what?\\
296 - (shouting): You can come out on the
pilot boat!\\
297 - The pilot boat?\\
298 - Yes.
Well, where do I get it?\\
299 - Ask the dock agent.\\
300 - Oh, okay.\\
301 - And hurry!\\
302 - Yeah, honey.\\
303 - Where can I get the-the pilot boat\\
304 - for the Constitution?\\
305 - You get down to the end of the pier,
turn right,\\
306 - and then after about 30 yards down,\\
307 - you'll see a ramp that leads down to
a lower level.\\
308 - On the lower level, you'll see a
little pier\\
309 - that has two boats tied to it.\\
310 - Yeah.
Those are the pilot boats.\\
311 - Oh, uh, uh, the end of the pier, uh,
lower level, two boats.\\
312 - You'd better hurry.\\
313 - Yeah.
They'll be leaving right away.\\
314 - Pardon me, mister.\\
315 - Mrs. Ricardo, what happened?\\
316 - Have you got a pilot boat that goes
to the pilot boat?\\
317 - You didn't miss it?\\
318 - Oh, didn't I?\\
319 - Well, what happened?\\
320 - Well, I'll tell you.\\
321 - You may not believe it, but I'll tell
you.\\
322 - I went down to the end of the pier.\\
323 - I ran 30 yards to the right.\\
324 - I ran down the ramp to the lower
level.\\
325 - I saw the little pier with the two
little boats tied to it,\\
326 - and one of them was on its way.\\
327 - So, I raced to the end of the pier\\
328 - and I made a flying leap across\\
329 - and landed ker-plunk on the deck.\\
330 - Well, then what are you doing here?\\
331 - That boat was on the way in!\\
332 - No. What about the other boat?\\
333 - By the time I noticed my mistake, it
was gone.\\
334 - What do I do now?\\
335 - The Independence is leaving in a
couple days. Maybe you can...\\
336 - I want to go on the Constitution\\
337 - so I can be with my husband, so I can
be with my friends,\\
338 - so I can eat my bon voyage fruit\\
339 - before it all gets spoiled.\\
340 - I'm sorry, lady, but...\\
341 - Wait a minute.
There might be a way.\\
342 - How? How?\\
343 - Just a month ago,\\
344 - we had a passenger miss this same
boat.\\
345 - He hired a helicopter and flew out to
it.\\
346 - Oh, that's wonderful! All right,
where do I get one?\\
347 - Idyllwild Airport.\\
348 - Oh, boy, a helicopter!\\
349 - A helicopter?!\\
350 - ("Sailing, Sailing" playing)\\
351 - You see Lucy yet?\\
352 - No. Wait till they get a little
closer.\\
353 - (boat engine roaring)\\
354 - (engine winding down)\\
355 - Lucy's... Lucy's not on that boat!\\
356 - No, she isn't!\\
357 - Maybe she's in the wheelhouse.\\
358 - (shouting):	      RICKY: Ahoy
there!		   Hey!\\
359 - (shouting): Hey!\\
360 - He hears you.\\
361 - Have you got a woman on that boat?\\
362 - MAN: What, are you a private
detective or something?\\
363 - Big joker.\\
364 - No. My wife, she missed this boat!\\
365 - She missed this one, too, buddy.\\
366 - How could Lucy miss that boat, too?!\\
367 - She's Lucy. Does that answer your
question?\\
368 - Well, there's one other chance, Mr.
Ricardo.\\
369 - What's that?\\
370 - About a month ago,\\
371 - one of our passengers missed the
boat,\\
372 - and he hired a helicopter and flew
out.\\
373 - A helicopter?\\
374 - I don't know.
I don't like the idea\\
375 - of Lucy taking a helicopter.\\
376 - That's too risky.\\
377 - Yeah, for the helicopter.\\
378 - Oh, come on now, Ricky.\\
379 - It's the only way.\\
380 - Well... where can we get one?\\
381 - Well, we'll have to call Idlewild
Airport.\\
382 - Okay. Yeah...
Why don't you come with me.\\
383 - Oh, Fred, what if Lucy misses the
helicopter?\\
384 - Well, if I know Lucy,\\
385 - she'll grease her body and swim after
it.\\
386 - Yes, madam?\\
387 - I want to rent a helicopter.\\
388 - Oh, I'm sorry, our helicopter is
being used right now.\\
389 - Oh, darn it.
I should have called.\\
390 - Isn't it a shame?\\
391 - It was sitting here all morning,\\
392 - and now it's just taking off on an
emergency call.\\
393 - Well, I'm an emergency, too.
When will it be back?\\
394 - Oh, I don't know, ma'am.\\
395 - It's leaving right now to pick up
some crazy dame\\
396 - who missed the SS Constitution.\\
397 - Well, get it back!
Get it back!\\
398 - But, ma'am...
I'm that crazy dame.\\
399 - Get it back!\\
400 - Come back!
Joe, Joe,\\
401 - radio the copter to come back to the
field immediately.\\
402 - Oh, for heaven's sake!\\
403 - Oh, well, don't just stand there!\\
404 - Do something! Get that plane back
here!\\
405 - I just did.\\
406 - I've got to get on that ship.\\
407 - My husband's on that ship.\\
408 - My friends are on that ship.\\
409 - We've planned to go to Europe for...\\
410 - You just did?\\
411 - Yes, ma'am.\\
412 - Oh, thank you! Thank you!\\
413 - I, uh, beg your pardon, madam, but,
uh, your slip is showing.\\
414 - Yeah, I know, and I...
I tore it, too\\
415 - when I jumped for the pilot boat.\\
416 - You jumped right out of your skirt?\\
417 - Uh, no. I had to take it off.\\
418 - I got it caught in a bicycle.\\
419 - Oh, I see.\\
420 - Uh, would you allow me to get some...
some coveralls?\\
421 - Oh, would you?\\
422 - I'd appreciate it so much. Thank you.\\
423 - Would you make that a size 12,
please?\\
424 - Yes.\\
425 - And maybe in charcoal gray\\
426 - so it would match what I'm wearing.\\
427 - Well, this is my first time on a
luxury liner,\\
428 - and I don't... don't want to look
tacky...\\
429 - ...going aboard.\\
430 - (helicopter rotor blades whirring)\\
431 - Have we left yet?\\
432 - Left?\\
433 - We're a thousand feet in the air.\\
434 - Oh... oh!\\
435 - Relax, Mrs. Ricardo. Relax.\\
436 - Well, I'll try, but I've never been
up in a helicopter before.\\
437 - Well, I guess it is a little
different\\
438 - from those big airliners.\\
439 - I got news for you:\\
440 - I've never been in one of those
either.\\
441 - Now, there's no reason to be
frightened.\\
442 - Please, Mrs. Ricardo, try to relax
and enjoy it.\\
443 - Yeah, I'll...
I'll try to relax,\\
444 - but I don't think I'm gonna enjoy it.\\
445 - (screams)\\
446 - Where's the door?!\\
447 - The door's gone!\\
448 - Well, we took it off,\\
449 - so it would be easier for you to get
out.\\
450 - Right now I'm just concerned with
staying in.\\
451 - Well, Mrs. Ricardo, just settle back\\
452 - and take a look at the view.\\
453 - Gee, all you can see is water.\\
454 - That's right.\\
455 - Except for that cigar someone threw
away.\\
456 - Mrs. Ricardo, that cigar is your
ship.\\
457 - That dainty little thing?\\
458 - It's the SS Constitution.\\
459 - Gee, the water must have shrunk it.\\
460 - Well, it will get a little bigger\\
461 - as we get down closer to it.\\
462 - Oh.\\
463 - Pretty good-size cigar, isn't it?\\
464 - Yeah. Now it's beginning to look like
a ship\\
465 - with little ants running all over it.\\
466 - You'd better start getting ready.\\
467 - Oh. Okay.\\
468 - How do I look?\\
469 - No, no, no.
I mean your harness.\\
470 - Is it on tight?\\
471 - You mean my safety belt?\\
472 - Oh, that isn't a safety belt.\\
473 - That's a harness.\\
474 - A harness? What do I need a harness
for?\\
475 - When we land, I just step out, don't
I?\\
476 - We're not allowed to land.\\
477 - Not allowed to land?!\\
478 - No.\\
479 - You mean we can't land on that deck?\\
480 - No, it's against the rules.\\
481 - I hover over the boat and lower you\\
482 - down on a cable.\\
483 - You hover over where and lower who on
a what?\\
484 - Now, Mrs. Ricardo, it's done all the
time.\\
485 - Not to me, it isn't.\\
486 - You turn this eggbeater around\\
487 - and go back to the airport.\\
488 - Well, I-I can assure you it's
perfectly safe.\\
489 - It's up to you.\\
490 - You want to get down to that boat,\\
491 - this is the only way to do it.\\
492 - You hover over the-the ship\\
493 - and-and-and lower me on-on something,
and then...\\
494 - Either that or back to the airport.\\
495 - Well...\\
496 - Now fasten that hook to your belt.\\
497 - What hook?\\
498 - That hook right out there.\\
499 - That one?
Yeah.\\
500 - I can't reach it.\\
501 - Wait a minute.
I'll release it for you.\\
502 - There.\\
503 - You got it?\\
504 - Yeah.\\
505 - Don't push!\\
506 - I'm not ready yet!\\
507 - I was trying to tell you to throw
your legs\\
508 - over the side and jump out, and I
gradually lower...\\
509 - I jump out?!\\
510 - Yeah.\\
511 - Now sit down on the edge\\
512 - put your feet over and jump out.\\
513 - I can't do it.
I can't do it.\\
514 - Yes, you can.\\
515 - No. Are you sure this cable's strong
enough?\\
516 - Yes, of course.\\
517 - Well, all right.\\
518 - I can't do it!\\
519 - You're going to have to give me a
push.\\
520 - Okay. I'll count to three.\\
521 - Okay.\\
522 - One...\\
523 - two...\\
524 - Wait a minute! I got an idea.\\
525 - What?\\
526 - Have you, by any chance,\\
527 - got enough gasoline to fly me all the
way to Europe?\\
528 - No, I'm afraid not.\\
529 - Well, maybe you can borrow some\\
530 - from the captain of the boat.\\
531 - I'll pay for it.\\
532 - I got a credit card.\\
533 - Money's no object.\\
534 - Mrs. Ricardo, this is the only way.\\
535 - Now, wait a minute.\\
536 - Think. Maybe you'll get an idea.\\
537 - Haste makes waste, you know?\\
538 - Now, come on. We're almost over the
ship.\\
539 - Now out you go.\\
540 - One, two, three.\\
541 - Are you all right?\\
542 - Huh?\\
543 - You all set?\\
544 - Yeah.\\
545 - Okay. Here we go.\\
546 - (Lucy screaming)\\
547 - (screaming excitedly)\\
548 - Lucy!\\
549 - Honey, hold on to that rope!\\
550 - Honey!\\
551 - Fred, look at her hang off of that
rope.\\
552 - Come on!\\
553 - RICKY: Honey, over here!\\
554 - Come on!\\
555 - Come on, honey!\\
556 - You all right, honey?\\
557 - Whoa!\\

559 - Come on, bring her down!\\
560 - Honey, are you all right?\\
561 - Oh. Oh.\\
562 - I got it.\\
563 - You get it?\\
564 - Oh...\\
565 - Good-bye.\\
566 - (applause)\\
567 - Oh, he was the nicest pilot.\\
568 - He didn't want me to do that,\\
569 - but I said, "Oh..."\\
570 - Are you all right?\\
571 - Oh, sure. I'm fine.\\
572 - There was nothing to...\\
573 - Well, I'm here, aren't I?\\
574 - Oh, the poor thing.\\
575 - MAN (over P.A.): Mrs. Anderson,
please come to the purser's office.\\
576 - Will Mrs. Anderson please come to the
purser's office.\\

newspaper?\\
579 - No.\\
580 - They just raved about your new\\
581 - MGM record of "Forever, Darling."\\
582 - No kidding.\\
583 - Yeah. They said it's gonna be\\
584 - one of the top records of the year.\\
585 - (chuckling): Well.\\
586 - Did you bring any records with you?\\
587 - Yeah.\\
588 - Well, let's get them to play it on
the public address system.\\
589 - Oh, no.\\
590 - Oh, why not?\\
591 - Well, that wouldn't be right.\\
592 - Oh, now, I know how modest you are,\\
593 - but think what a treat it would be
for the passengers.\\
594 - Oh, honey...\\
595 - RICKY (over P.A.): Forever, darling\\

Oh, shh...\\

honeymoon.\\
25 - Don't you feel that way, Ethel?\\
26 - You forget I'm married to Fred.\\
27 - Can you imagine anything making him
romantic?\\
28 - I can just see the two of you, after
a couple of days at sea,\\
29 - standing at the rail in the
moonlight,\\
30 - you'll be holding his hand.\\
31 - If we're standing by the rail, I'll
be holding his head.\\
32 - Or he'll be maneuvering\\
33 - to throw me overboard.\\
34 - Ha, ha! Well, for Ricky and me,\\
35 - it's gonna be just one long romantic
interlude--\\
36 - five whole days of being together\\
37 - and having nothing to do but fun.\\
38 - Will you wave to me once in a while
so I won't get lonely?\\

wanted\\

chaperon.\\

for any of these things?\\
72 - I'm afraid not, honey.\\
73 - Oh... can't you Ping one little Pong?\\
74 - Now, look, honey, when we first
talked about this trip,\\
75 - I said that I was gonna be very busy\\
76 - and I wouldn't have much time to
spend with you.\\
77 - And you said, "That's all right,
dear."\\
78 - And I said, "Are you sure?"\\
79 - And you said...\\
80 - What did you do-- tape-record the
whole conversation?\\
81 - Now, Lucy, that's the way it's gotta
be,\\
82 - so why don't you make the best of it,
huh?\\
83 - Well...\\
84 - Come on, give me a smile.\\
85 - Come on!\\
86 - That's my girl.\\
87 - Oh, you mean on the whole trip, I'm
not gonna be ab...\\

time off.\\

97 - Oh...
(sighing)\\

102 - You've gained a Ping-Pong partner--
me.\\
103 - Well, I guess you're better than
nothing.\\
104 - Thanks a lot.\\
105 - Oh, I didn't really mean that.\\
106 - I can't afford to offend you.\\
107 - Oh, that's all right.\\
108 - I can't afford to be offended.\\
109 - Hmm. Well, I'll change my clothes.\\
110 - We might as well sign up for
something.\\
111 - Oh, that's gonna be great.\\
112 - Two lonely dames.\\
113 - Oh, there you are, baby doll.\\
114 - I've been looking all over this boat
for you,\\
115 - you little dickens.\\
116 - Come on, honeybunch, let's not waste\\
117 - one single precious second of this
trip.\\
118 - Fred, what's in those seasick pills\\
119 - you've been taking?\\
120 - Now, sweetie pie, is that any way for
you to talk\\
121 - to your apple dumpling?\\
122 - Fred, what's the matter with you?\\
123 - Nothing, sweetheart.\\
124 - It's this ocean voyage,\\
125 - the sea air, you and I together.\\
126 - It just gets me.\\
127 - Yeah, in the head.\\
128 - Now, listen, Ethel,\\
129 - this could be a second honeymoon,\\
130 - so don't louse it up.\\
131 - Wait a minute.\\
132 - Fred, do you really mean it?\\
133 - Of course I do, honey.\\
134 - Look, we can play in all these
tournaments and win them.\\
135 - Now, will you come with me?\\
136 - Oh, anywhere, honey, anywhere.\\
137 - Goodie! Goodie! Goodie!\\
138 - (laughing giddily)\\
139 - Okay, Ethel, I'm ready.\\
140 - Oh, hi, Fred.
Hi!\\
141 - What?
Lucy?\\
142 - I guess you'll have to find yourself\\
143 - another Ping-Pong partner.\\
144 - How come?\\
145 - Well, we're gonna be\\
146 - on our second honeymoon, too.\\
147 - (chuckling)\\
148 - The lovebug has bitten my Freddie.\\
149 - The lovebug?\\
150 - I thought Fred had been vaccinated
for that.\\
151 - Honeybun, I'll go and get my sneakers\\
152 - and then we'll sign up for the
Ping-Pong tournament.\\
153 - Bye-eee.\\
154 - Bye-eee.\\
155 - Why, isn't he cute?\\
156 - Cute?\\
157 - Oh, boy, if the sea air affects him
like this\\
158 - when we get back to New York,\\
159 - I'm gonna sell the apartment building
and buy a houseboat.\\
160 - Well, I hope you two lovebirds\\
161 - will be very happy.\\
162 - Oh, come on, honey, you can play the
games with us.\\
163 - Oh, no, no, three's a crowd.\\
164 - Oh, come on now,\\

181 - Thank you.
Thank you.\\
182 - Oh, hello, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
183 - Hello, I'd like to sign up for
everything,\\
184 - but I'm particularly good at
Ping-Pong.\\
185 - I... I really like that game... I...\\
186 - Well, uh, who will your partner be?\\
187 - Oh, well, I-- at the moment-- don't
have a partner,\\
188 - but I thought perhaps...\\
189 - Well, I'll play with anyone.\\
190 - Well, I'll do what I can to get a
partner for you, Mrs. Ricardo,\\
191 - but right now all I have is couples.\\
192 - Yes.\\
193 - Well, I'll, I'll wait outside.\\
194 - All right.\\
195 - (giggling)\\
196 - Oh, Freddie.\\
197 - (laughing harder)\\
198 - Ethel, what's the name of this boat?\\
199 - The SS Constitution. Why?\\
200 - Well, from the way everybody's paired
up,\\
201 - I thought maybe it was the SS Noah's
Ark.\\
202 - Oh, honey.\\
203 - I'll see you outside.\\
204 - Okay.\\
205 - (clearing throat)\\
206 - Pardon me...\\
207 - but do you play Ping-Pong?\\
208 - Well, as a matter of fact, I do.\\
209 - Not very well, but I do like the
game.\\
210 - So do I, and I...
I noticed that they have...\\
211 - Well, dear, they're ready for us.\\
212 - Hello, darling.\\
213 - Would you excuse me?\\
214 - Oh, surely.\\
215 - Come on, Rocky.\\
216 - That a boy.\\
217 - Hi, honey.\\
218 - Oh.\\
219 - Come on.
Get around there.\\
220 - Come on.\\
221 - Sit.\\
222 - Stay.\\
223 - Rocky and I had a nice walk.\\
224 - You play Ping-Pong?\\
225 - Well, I always knew you were my best
friend,\\
226 - but I didn't know you'd be my only
one.\\
227 - You'll never leave me, will you?\\
228 - You gonna stick with me, pal?\\
229 - You gonna be...\\
230 - (sighing)\\
231 - Oh, pardon me, Mrs. Ricardo,\\
232 - but I think I found you a partner.\\
233 - Oh, really?
Yes.\\
234 - His name is Kenneth Hamilton.\\
235 - Kenneth Hamilton.\\
236 - I'll ask him to come over and see
you.\\
237 - Well, thank you very much.\\
238 - Hello.\\
239 - Hello.\\
240 - You looking for someone?\\
241 - Yes. Are you Mrs. Ricardo?\\
242 - Yes. Why?\\
243 - My name is Kenneth Hamilton.\\
244 - Well, put her there, partner.\\
245 - Ricky, what are you doing,\\
246 - sitting here in the room with me?\\
247 - Shouldn't you be somewhere?\\
248 - No, I still got three minutes\\
249 - before I have to start the dance.\\
250 - Oh, goodie, goodie, gumdrop!\\
251 - Three whole minutes just for me.\\
252 - Never mind.\\
253 - It says here you played in the
shuffleboard contest.\\
254 - Not only played, we won.\\
255 - Oh. Who's Kenneth Hamilton?\\
256 - Kenny, oh, he's a doll.\\
257 - He's so cute.\\
258 - (chuckling)\\
259 - He is?\\
260 - Yes. He wanted me to keep the cup
that we won,\\
261 - but I said, "Kenny, dear, you keep
the cup.\\
262 - It will remind you always of our..."\\
263 - Wait a minute.\\
264 - ...wonderful afternoon." Wait, wait,
wait, wait...\\
265 - Wait just a minute.\\
266 - What do you mean, you said, "Kenny,
dear"?\\
267 - Who is this guy anyway?\\
268 - Oh, he's just a nice, young man,
unmarried,\\
269 - looking for someone to have a little
fun with aboard ship.\\
270 - Look, Lucy, you watch out.\\
271 - There's a lot of wolves aboard these
big ocean liners.\\
272 - Oh-ho-ho, you're telling me.\\
273 - What do you mean by that?\\
274 - Nothing. Just "oh-ho-ho, you're
telling me."\\
275 - Well, oh-ho-ho, I'm telling you, you
keep away from that guy.\\
276 - But I promised I'd dance with him
tonight.\\
277 - Well, you're not gonna dance with him
tonight.\\
278 - Oh, well, who will I be dancing with?
You?\\
279 - Now, you know I'm gonna have to be
working.\\
280 - Well, then I'll just have to dance
every dance with Kenny.\\
281 - You don't have to dance no dances
with Kenny.\\
282 - But I promised him.\\
283 - I don't care what you promised him!\\
284 - (knocking at door)\\
285 - Huh!\\
286 - Whoo-hoo-hoo!\\
287 - Come in, please.\\
288 - Is Mrs. Ricardo here?\\
289 - Oh, yes, right here.\\
290 - I know you-- you're Ricky Ricardo.\\
291 - I'm pleased to meet you.\\
292 - My name is Kenneth Hamilton.\\
293 - Oh, ha, ha, ha!\\
294 - I am pleased to meet you, Kenny.\\

302 - Oh, boy!\\
303 - (laughing uncontrollably)\\
304 - (upbeat dance music playing)\\
305 - Everybody!\\
306 - Ay, ay, ay, ay\\
307 - Ay, ay, ay\\
308 - Canta y no llores\\

315 - Aha!\\
316 - (band playing finale)\\
317 - RICKY: Thank you.\\
318 - Thank you very much.\\
319 - Fred, you're a wonderful dancer.\\
320 - You're a regular king of the samba.\\
321 - Arthur Murray, look out.\\
322 - (giggling)\\
323 - Whew!
Wasn't that fun?\\
324 - Yeah.
Thank you, Kenny.\\
325 - Thank you for the dance.\\
326 - I have to go now.\\
327 - It's past my bedtime.\\
328 - Hi.\\
329 - Uh-oh, don't tell me.\\
330 - I never forget a face.\\
331 - Oh, yes, you're Ricky Ricardo.\\
332 - Now, cut it out.\\
333 - You know I have to be working.\\
334 - You might be understanding.\\
335 - I might be, yes, but let's face it,\\
336 - I'm a sea-going sorehead.\\
337 - FRED: Say, kitten,\\
338 - how about a little walk out on the
deck in the moonlight?\\
339 - You know what I mean?\\
340 - (giggling)
Yes, sir.\\
341 - Will you excuse us?\\
342 - Gladly.\\
343 - Let's go, tiger.\\
344 - He is one, too.\\
345 - Tiger?!\\
346 - They're on their second honeymoon.\\
347 - Haven't you heard?\\
348 - Come on, sit down.\\
349 - The least you can do is talk with me
for a while.\\
350 - Ah, I got a few minutes.\\
351 - Well, what have you planned for
tomorrow?\\
352 - Well...\\
353 - Pardon me, Mr. Ricardo.\\
354 - Captain Jacobson would like to talk
to you.\\
355 - Okay.\\
356 - I'm awfully sorry, honey, but I...\\
357 - Oh, that's all right.
Go right ahead.\\
358 - I'm all talked out anyway.\\
359 - See you later.\\
360 - Ricky?\\
361 - Yes, dear.\\
362 - What time do you finish tonight?\\
363 - Oh, about 2:30, I guess.\\
364 - Well, I'm gonna wait for you.\\
365 - We've gotta have some time together.\\
366 - Honey, it'll be awfully late.\\
367 - I don't care.\\
368 - I'll, I'll wait on the promenade
deck.\\
369 - Okay.\\
370 - See you later.\\
371 - Marco, play that song, all right?\\
372 - (lilting piano music playing)\\
373 - FRED: Can't a man sit on the stairs
with his wife\\
374 - without somebody butting in?\\
375 - I'm sorry, Fred.\\
376 - (Ethel giggling)\\
377 - RICKY: Well, I'll see you tomorrow,
Marco.\\
378 - Good night.\\
379 - (muttering)\\
380 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
381 - Hi, dear.\\
382 - Oh, brother, am I beat.\\
383 - Yeah, I know, but you just forget all
about your work now.\\
384 - This is fun time.\\
385 - Yep.\\
386 - Let's dance.\\
387 - Dance?\\
388 - Yeah.\\
389 - There's no music.\\
390 - Well, I'll hum.\\
391 - (humming)\\
392 - Honey, I'd love to dance with you,\\
393 - but I've been standing on my feet all
day long.\\
394 - Of course you have, dear.\\
395 - Do you want to take off your shoes?\\
396 - I'd like to take off my feet.\\
397 - Oh.\\
398 - Well, forget all about dancing.\\
399 - We'll, we'll just stand here\\
400 - and look at that big, yellow,
romantic moon, huh?\\
401 - (sighing)\\
402 - Gee, isn't it beautiful?\\
403 - (yawning): Uh-huh.\\
404 - (sighing)\\
405 - Ricky?\\
406 - Hmm?\\
407 - I thought this was going to be our
second honeymoon.\\
408 - It is, honey, it is.\\
409 - (sniffling)\\
410 - Well, you haven't even kissed me.\\
411 - Oh, that's right.\\
412 - Oh, Ricky...
Excuse me, honey.\\
413 - Excuse me.\\
414 - We'll just stand here and look at the
moon, huh?\\
415 - All right.\\
416 - (snoring)\\
417 - (snoring loudly)\\
418 - (snoring loudly)\\
419 - Lucy, what did you want to see me
about?\\
420 - Is something wrong?\\
421 - Ethel, you gotta help me.\\
422 - Oh, no.\\
423 - You don't even know what it's about.\\
424 - I know that tone in your voice.\\
425 - Now, this is important.\\
426 - Listen, Lucy,\\
427 - I don't mind helping you out on dry
land,\\
428 - but this is the high seas.\\
429 - International law prevails.\\
430 - It's just a simple, little thing.\\
431 - Okay. What is it?
What do you want to do?\\
432 - Kidnap Ricky.\\
433 - A simple, little thing?!\\
434 - Oh, no, I'm not gonna have anything
to do with it.\\
435 - Ethel, aren't you...\\
436 - Ar-Aren't you willing to help me\\
437 - spend just one evening...\\
438 - just a few fleeting, golden moments
alone with my husband?\\
439 - Well, as long as you put it that way,
I'll do it.\\
440 - Okay, now, when he comes in at 7:00\\
441 - and goes in there to change his
clothes,\\
442 - I'm going to lock the door...\\
443 - and I'm going to give you the key.\\
444 - Where will I be?\\
445 - Out on the deck.\\
446 - I'll hand you the key\\
447 - through the porthole thusly and then
you disappear.\\
448 - Uh... what happens when Ricky\\
449 - doesn't show up on the bandstand?\\
450 - Good thinking.\\
451 - After I hand you the key,\\
452 - you tell Marco Ricky isn't feeling
well\\
453 - and then you disappear.\\
454 - Uh... one more question, Raffles.\\
455 - Yes?\\
456 - What about the telephone?\\
457 - I have disconnected the wires.\\
458 - Good girl!\\
459 - Now, hall we synchronize our watches?\\
460 - Okay.\\
461 - 5:03.\\
462 - 5:03.\\
463 - Psst.\\
464 - Not yet, Ethel. You're early.\\
465 - Well, Tiger's waiting for me on the
upper deck,\\
466 - and I don't want to keep him waiting.\\
467 - Listen, you've waited for 25 years.\\
468 - You can wait a few more minutes.\\
469 - Hi.\\
470 - Hi, dear.\\
471 - What have you been doing?\\
472 - Oh, nothing much.\\
473 - I supposed you want to get dressed\\
474 - and rush right off, so the bathroom
is yours, dear.\\
475 - Thank you.\\
476 - (whispering): Ethel.\\
477 - (sighing)\\
478 - Honey, I got a surprise for you.\\
479 - Oh, you have a surprise for me?\\
480 - Yes, ma'am.\\
481 - You and I are going to spend the
entire evening together.\\
482 - I fixed it so I could get the whole
night off.\\
483 - Oh, honey, how wonderful!\\
484 - Oh, Ricky, that's just great.\\
485 - Isn't that great?\\
486 - Dinner first, and then dancing,\\
487 - and then a walk around the deck\\
488 - under the moonlight--\\
489 - you know, the whole romance bit.\\
490 - Oh, who could ask for a...?\\
491 - Yipe!\\
492 - What's the matter?\\
493 - Ethel!\\
494 - Ethel! Ethel!\\
495 - What's the matter?\\
496 - Oh, Ethel!\\
497 - Ethel! Ethel, come back! Ethel!\\
498 - Lucy, what's the matter with you?\\
499 - Ethel! Ethel!\\
500 - Lucy, what's the matter with you?\\
501 - Nothing.\\
502 - Well, come back in here.\\
503 - Uh... okay.\\
504 - Ethel.\\
505 - Oh...\\
506 - Come back in here!\\
507 - I can't.\\
508 - What do you mean, you can't?\\
509 - I'm stuck.\\
510 - Stuck?\\
511 - I can't get back.\\
512 - Ricky, get me out of here.\\
513 - Pull my legs.\\
514 - I can't get you out.\\
515 - Pull my legs.\\
516 - Oh, Ricky, I'm stuck.\\
517 - Well, wait a minute.
I'll go outside.\\
518 - The door is locked.
Where's the key?\\
519 - What?\\
520 - Where's the key?\\
521 - I don't believe it.\\
522 - The door is locked.
Where's the key?\\
523 - Oh, uh... Ethel has it.\\
524 - Ethel has it?!\\
525 - Yeah. I-I had a surprise for you,
too.\\
526 - You were gonna be my prisoner.\\
527 - Now, what... what made you go and do
a thing like that?\\
528 - Well, I don't know.\\
529 - It seemed like a good idea at the
time.\\
530 - I told you I was gonna get time off.\\
531 - Yeah, well, I didn't know.\\
532 - Of all the craziest, silliest things\\
533 - that you have ever done...\\
534 - Good evening.\\
535 - I don't understand it.\\
536 - Never mind that.
This is no time to argue.\\
537 - Get me out of here.\\
538 - Pull my legs.\\
539 - I tried that; it won't work.\\
540 - Try it again, for heaven's sakes.\\
541 - Oh, honey, I don't...\\
542 - Good evening.\\
543 - RICKY: Good evening. How are you?\\
544 - Nice to see you...\\
545 - Lucy, what's the matter?\\
546 - What's the matter?\\
547 - Oh, Ethel, give him the key.\\
548 - The key?\\
549 - What good is the key?
She's stuck.\\
550 - She's stuck?\\
551 - What did he try to do to you?\\
552 - Oh, he didn't try to do anything to
me.\\
553 - I'm just stuck, that's all.\\
554 - For heaven's sakes, somebody unstick
me.\\
555 - Pull my legs, Ricky!\\
556 - RICKY: Pull your legs?\\
557 - If I only had a few baseballs,\\
558 - I could make a fortune.\\
559 - Oh, Fred.\\
560 - What'll we do, honey?\\
561 - Try to pull me out of here.\\
562 - Try to pull you out?
Is your arm stuck right there?\\
563 - Oh, oh, wait a minute, everybody get
together!\\
564 - (straining)\\
565 - (Lucy screaming)\\
566 - My love is true, amor tierno\\
567 - I promise you amor eterno\\
568 - So cling to me, dear, and say\\
569 - You'll never let me go\\
570 - Because I love you so, querida mia.\\
571 - Oh, that was lovely, sweetheart.\\
572 - Thank you.\\
573 - We finally got to be alone together,
didn't we, dear?\\
574 - Yes, baby.\\
575 - (tittering)\\
576 - MAN: Is it cool enough to start

2 - ANNOUNCER: And now, "I Love Lucy."\\
3 - (applause)\\
4 - Oh, Ricky, can you believe it?\\
5 - We're in London!\\
6 - How about it, eh?\\
7 - It just doesn't seem real,\\
8 - actually seeing all those places:\\
9 - Picadilly, London Bridge, Westminster
Abbey.\\
10 - Isn't it exciting?\\
11 - Oh, and look at this lovely room.\\
12 - Isn't it nice?\\
13 - Oh, honey, we have a balcony!\\
14 - Oh, yeah.\\
15 - Will that	    Yes.
be all, sir?	    Thank you.\\
16 - Pardon me, but could you tell me\\
17 - where Buckingham Palace is from here?\\
18 - Yes, ma'am.
It's right over that way.\\
19 - Oh, Ricky, we can see it from here!\\
20 - Yeah!\\
21 - Isn't it beautiful?\\
22 - Wonderful.\\
23 - Oh, gee, I-I'm just dying to see the
queen.\\
24 - Oh, have you ever seen the queen?\\
25 - No, ma'am.\\
26 - But I came frightful close during the
coronation.\\
27 - I just missed her.\\
28 - Aw, what a shame.\\
29 - But I did catch a glimpse of him.\\
30 - Philip?\\
31 - No, ma'am. Danny Kaye.\\
32 - I'll bring up the rest of your
luggage.\\
33 - All right.\\
34 - Isn't this wonderful?
Isn't it exciting?\\
35 - Don't you just love it?\\
36 - I say, old bean, ain't this the nuts?\\
37 - (Ricky laughs)\\
38 - What a city this is!\\
39 - How's your room?\\
40 - It's great, just like this.
Same view and everything.\\
41 - Uh, one thing stumped him though.\\
42 - I didn't know whether to give him
tuppence\\
43 - or thruppence.\\
44 - Fred, thruppence is only about three
cents.\\
45 - Well, he solved it rather neatly.\\
46 - What'd he give?\\
47 - Nuppence.\\
48 - Well, it's not my fault.\\
49 - I just can't figure the money over
here.\\
50 - What was your excuse in the USA?\\
51 - Fred is now the darling of the
bellhops\\
52 - on two different continents.\\
53 - (chuckling)\\
54 - Well, whether I tip him or not,\\
55 - remember that there'll always be an
England.\\
56 - Yeah, but it won't always have us in
it.\\
57 - Come on, we got a million sights to
see.\\
58 - Let's go to Buckingham Palace first
and see the queen.\\
59 - Honey, it's only 10:00.\\
60 - Queens don't get up this early.\\
61 - How would you know?\\
62 - Oh, well, let's just go by the palace
and look.\\
63 - You know, see if the shades are down.\\
64 - Yeah, and if the milk is in the front
porch,\\
65 - don't ring the bell.\\
66 - Oh, I won't, honey.\\
67 - Fred, while their majesties are out
here hobnobbing\\
68 - with the royalty, let's you and I go
to the theater, huh?\\
69 - Right-o.\\
70 - Oh, honey, aren't you gonna go with
us?\\
71 - No, I gotta go to the Palladium.\\
72 - I'll go get my coat.\\
73 - Okay.
I'll go get my coat, too.\\
74 - Hey, maybe we can do some shopping.\\
75 - Okay, I want to get some souvenirs.\\
76 - Souvenirs! Okay.\\
77 - Honey, if I'm gonna go shopping,\\
78 - I need some money.\\
79 - All right, but no funny stuff now.\\
80 - What do you mean?\\
81 - Well, back in Hollywood,\\
82 - you came home with John Wayne's
footprints.\\
83 - I don't want to find Big Ben\\
84 - ticking right next to my bed.\\
85 - Here.\\
86 - Thanks...
What's this?\\
87 - That's 10, English money.\\
88 - English money!\\
89 - Yeah.\\
90 - How much is this in our money?\\
91 - Well a pound is $2.80 So that's $28.\\
92 - 28? Well, thank you.\\
93 - Hey, what if I want to buy something
less than $28?\\
94 - You get change, just like you do in
America.\\
95 - Well, I won't know what kind of
change I should be getting.\\
96 - Well, here it is, right in this
little book.\\
97 - Now, you know how much a pound is.\\
98 - Sure, 16 ounces.\\
99 - A pound is $2.80.\\
100 - Oh.\\
101 - There are 20 shillings in a pound.\\
102 - Each shilling is worth 14 cents.\\
103 - There are seven shillings in a dollar\\
104 - and 12 pennies in one shilling, see.\\
105 - No wonder the Pilgrims left here to
go to America.\\
106 - Just buy whatever you want\\
107 - and trust the people to give you the
right change.\\
108 - All right, honey, I will.\\
109 - ETHEL: Okay.\\
110 - I'm ready, honey.\\
111 - I'm all ready to go shopping.\\
112 - You all set, Rick?
Yeah.\\
113 - I'll see you later.
So long, Ricky.\\
114 - All right.
Bye, Fred.\\
115 - Don't spend all that dough, I gave
you, Ethel.\\
116 - How much you give her?\\
117 - $10.\\
118 - $10?\\
119 - Well, ten of whatever they call
dollars over here.\\
120 - Fred, if you gave her 10, you gave
her $28.\\
121 - $28! Holy cow.\\
122 - Ethel! Ethel! Ethel...\\
123 - (chuckling)\\
124 - Come on.\\
125 - I told you it was too early for the
queen.\\
126 - Well, she gotta come out sometime.\\
127 - I thought we were gonna go shopping.\\
128 - Later, later.\\
129 - No, let's go now.
We can come back here.\\
130 - No. We might miss her.\\
131 - Wouldn't you feel terrible\\
132 - if you went home without seeing the
queen?\\
133 - I'd feel much worse if I went home\\
134 - without spending the money Fred gave
me.\\
135 - Oh. Look at the book\\
136 - and see if it says what time she
comes out.\\
137 - Oh, okay.\\
138 - Nope, just tells about the palace,\\
139 - how old it is and how many rooms it
has.\\
140 - Oh, how many rooms has it got?\\
141 - Over 500!\\
142 - No wonder she hasn't come out.\\
143 - She's probably lost.\\
144 - Oh, look, look!
I see a man.\\
145 - Where?\\
146 - Right there.\\
147 - Do you think that might be Philip?\\
148 - Oh, I doubt it.
I hardly think\\
149 - Philip would be out wrestling ash
cans.\\
150 - Oh...\\
151 - Come on, honey, let's go shopping,
huh?\\
152 - Come on.\\
153 - Wait a minute.\\
154 - Pardon me, sir, could you tell me\\
155 - when the queen might be coming out?\\
156 - (speaking garbled British English)\\
157 - Quite clear?\\
158 - Glad to be of service.
Good morning.\\
159 - What'd he say?\\
160 - Couldn't you understand him?\\
161 - He said: (speaking gibberish).\\
162 - What's that?\\
163 - I don't know.\\
164 - And after living with Ricky for 15
years,\\
165 - I thought I could understand anybody.\\
166 - Let's go, honey, huh?\\
167 - Wait a minute.
Maybe this man will know.\\
168 - Pardon me, but could you tell me\\
169 - what time the queen might be coming
out?\\
170 - I say, could you tell me\\
171 - what time the queen might be coming
out, sir?\\
172 - Lucy...
What?\\
173 - He's not allowed to pay any attention
to anyone.\\
174 - How do you know?\\
175 - Says it right here in the book.\\
176 - He's a palace guard.\\
177 - He's not allowed to pay any attention
to anyone.\\
178 - He's not even allowed to smile.\\
179 - Why not?\\
180 - It's tradition\\
181 - and no one can make him break the
rule.\\
182 - I bet I can.\\
183 - Lucy?\\
184 - I bet I can make him smile.\\
185 - Now, Lucy...\\
186 - Hello.\\
187 - He's a big one, isn't he?\\
188 - Will you pardon me\\
189 - while I pretend not to know who you
are?\\
190 - So you won't smile, huh?\\
191 - Come on.\\
192 - (laughing boisterously)\\
193 - (laughing louder and harder)\\
194 - Well...\\
195 - (humming taunting tune)\\
196 - Wow, you make Ed Sullivan look like
laughing boy.\\
197 - Did you ever hear the one about the
dog psychiatrist\\
198 - that wrote a book?\\
199 - It's called Is Your Cocker Off His
Rocker?\\
200 - Is Your Collie Off His Trolley?\\
201 - Is Your Poodle Off His Noodle?\\
202 - I don't know, that kills them in
America.\\
203 - Oh, Lucy, what a thrill!\\
204 - What?\\
205 - Well, didn't you see her?\\
206 - Who?\\
207 - The queen.
She just drove out.\\
208 - No! No!
I missed her!\\
209 - Oh, it's all your fault, you sphinx
you.\\
210 - I say, excuse me,\\
211 - I found the answer to your question.\\
212 - (unintelligible)\\
213 - Oh, just a minute now.\\
214 - What'd you say?\\
215 - I said, (unintelligible).\\
216 - You'll have to pardon us.\\
217 - We're Americans.\\
218 - We don't understand English.\\
219 - Could you perhaps\\
220 - talk just a bit slower?\\
221 - Oh, yes, sorry.\\
222 - I understand Her Majesty's appearing
at 1:00\\
223 - at the Wimbleshire Hotel Charity
Luncheon.\\
224 - Thank you! The Wimbleshire Hotel--
that's our hotel.\\
225 - Okay, yeah.
We gotta go right now.\\
226 - Right now.
Good-bye, Smiley.\\
227 - Come on, honey, it's almost 1:00.\\
228 - You want to miss the queen again?\\
229 - All right, I'm coming.\\
230 - You wouldn't want me to have a shiny
nose\\
231 - when I see the queen, would you?\\
232 - (crowd cheering)\\
233 - What's that?\\
234 - (crowd cheering)\\
235 - It's a big mob to get somebody's
autograph.\\
236 - Is it the queen?\\
237 - Oh, they all went inside.\\
238 - Come on, come on, honey, let's go
down.\\
239 - Oh, I hope we don't miss her again.\\
240 - Oh, we won't.
Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
241 - (crowd clamoring)\\
242 - Can you see her?\\
243 - No, I can't see a thing.\\
244 - Gee, I didn't know queens gave out
autographs.\\
245 - Neither did I. Can I borrow a sheet
of your autograph?\\
246 - Thank you very much.\\
247 - Would you pass this in there?\\
248 - I'd like to have an autograph too,
please.\\
249 - Do you see anything?\\
250 - Nope, not a thing.\\
251 - Jump way up.\\
252 - See her now?\\
253 - No.\\
254 - Gee, that isn't fair.\\
255 - They live here.\\
256 - They've seen her before.\\
257 - Here it comes.\\
258 - Oh, thank you very much.\\
259 - What's the matter?\\
260 - "Best wishes to one of my British
fans.\\
261 - Signed, Ricky Ricardo."\\
262 - Really!\\
263 - Well, that's just about the sneakiest
thing\\
264 - you ever did in your whole life.\\
265 - What did I do?\\
266 - All I did was come home.\\
267 - Yes, you came home at 1:00--\\
268 - the same time the queen was supposed
to arrive.\\
269 - That's the second time today I missed
her.\\
270 - Can I help it if the English people\\
271 - are nice enough to think of me as a
celebrity?\\
272 - Oh...		Besides...\\
273 - I wish you'd never made a movie.\\
274 - Really.\\
275 - I want to tell you something.\\
276 - Shh...\\
277 - Uh, could you tell me, please,\\
278 - what time the queen is arriving for
the charity luncheon today?\\
279 - What?!\\
280 - Oh, thank you.\\
281 - The luncheon was yesterday.\\
282 - (chuckling)\\
283 - Well, it's not funny and it's all
your fault.\\
284 - My fault?\\
285 - Yes. If we'd left New York a day
earlier,\\
286 - we'd have been here yesterday, and
I'd have seen the queen.\\
287 - Look, would you just calm down for
one minute?\\
288 - I got something to tell you.\\
289 - Well, all right, one minute, but
hurry up!\\
290 - I gotta get out and look for the
queen.\\
291 - That's just what I want to talk to
you about.\\
292 - Now, tomorrow night we open our show\\
293 - at the Palladium, right?
Yeah.\\
294 - All right. The royal family's gonna
be there.\\
295 - Not only will you get to see the
queen,\\
296 - you're gonna be presented to her.\\
297 - I... I... I'm gonna be presented to
the queen?\\
298 - Yes.\\
299 - Oh, Ricky!\\
300 - What'll I wear?
What'll I do?\\
301 - What'll I say?
How will I act?\\
302 - Honey, I'm really gonna be presented
to the queen?\\
303 - Yes.
Lucy, did you hear?\\
304 - We're gonna meet the queen.\\
305 - Yes. I'm so excited, I can't stand
it.\\
306 - Imagine me, meeting a queen
face-to-face.\\
307 - I'm scared.\\
308 - You're scared-- think of the queen.\\
309 - There's nothing to be scared about.\\
310 - Gee, I don't know how to address a
queen.\\
311 - What do I say-- "Hello, Highness"?\\
312 - "Good evening, Elizabeth"?\\
313 - Oh, uh, maybe just call her "Mrs.
Mountbatten."\\
314 - LUCY.
Oh.\\
315 - Oh, you make so much of this.\\
316 - You just walk up, slip her the grip\\
317 - and say, "Hiya, Queen."\\
318 - Fred, honestly.\\
319 - Well, why not? I've seen her in the
newsreel,\\
320 - and she looks like a real good egg.\\
321 - Oh, Fred!\\
322 - No, no. I think you call her "Your
Majesty."\\
323 - "Your Majesty"?\\
324 - RICKY: That's right.\\
325 - Uh, uh, Your Maj...\\
326 - Good evening, Your Majesty.\\
327 - How do you do?\\
328 - I don't think you shake hands.\\
329 - No?\\
330 - When women are presented to the
queen,\\
331 - they curtsey.\\
332 - They curtsey!\\
333 - Of course they...\\
334 - Oh, dear.\\
335 - What's the matter?\\
336 - Well, I can't get into my good dress\\
337 - with my girdle off\\
338 - and I can't curtsey with it on.\\
339 - Well, you know,\\
340 - I haven't curtsied since I was a kid.\\
341 - Well, I can remember how.\\
342 - You put your foot like that\\
343 - and then you bring it around\\
344 - and you make a nice bow...\\
345 - Lower, Ethel, lower.\\
346 - That's as low as I can get.\\
347 - The queen's gonna have to meet me
halfway.\\
348 - How's this, Ricky?\\
349 - RICKY: That's not too bad.\\
350 - Oh, say, you know, this isn't easy.\\
351 - It's been years\\
352 - since I used my curtsey muscles.\\
353 - Hey, we'd better practice.\\
354 - Yeah, let's practice.\\
355 - You know, we'll probably have on a
big dress, too,\\
356 - you know, a big wide skirt.\\
357 - ETHEL: We ought to really practice a
sweeping one.\\
358 - It'll make it more graceful, you
know.\\
359 - Let's see now. My dress would come
out to about there.\\
360 - Ooh!\\
361 - Down, girl, down.\\
362 - Just a minute now, I'll make it.\\
363 - Rome wasn't built in a day.\\
364 - Rome wasn't built like you either.\\
365 - You mind your own business!\\
366 - Yeah, you and Ricky practice your
bowing.\\
367 - ETHEL: Yeah, practice bowing.\\
368 - All right.\\
369 - LUCY: Now, let's see.\\
370 - There, that feels good.\\
371 - I say, you Americans do have strange
customs, don't you?\\
372 - We were just practicing bowing.\\
373 - Yes, we're gonna be presented to the
queen.\\
374 - Are you now?\\
375 - Ain't that nice?\\
376 - Uh, good evening, Your Majesty.\\
377 - Oh, blimey, that'll never do.\\
378 - Huh, what's the matter with it?\\
379 - Well, ma'am, according to British
etiquette,\\
380 - when you're presented to the queen,\\
381 - your curtsey is all the way down,\\
382 - resting the weight on the heel,\\
383 - extending the end\\
384 - and bowing the head like this.\\
385 - All the way down.\\
386 - Oh, that's pretty, yeah.\\
387 - All the way down.\\
388 - All the...\\
389 - This leg is over here.\\
390 - All the way down.\\
391 - On the heel.\\
392 - Then extend the hand and bowing the
head.\\
393 - Boy, I'd like to have the lineament
concession\\
394 - for this group.\\
395 - It's simple once you get the hang of
it.\\
396 - Well, thanks very much for showing
us.\\
397 - Oh, ma'am, one thing you got to watch
out for.\\
398 - What?\\
399 - The hind leg.\\
400 - The hind leg?\\
401 - The one you puts behind you.\\
402 - Keep it firm so's you don't topple
over.\\
403 - Oh. I wish she hadn't mentioned that.\\
404 - Try it, honey.\\
405 - Topple over?\\
406 - Keep the hind leg firm.\\
407 - Yeah.\\
408 - Firm and sit on your heel.\\
409 - That's it, that's it!\\
410 - And, uh...\\
411 - Yes, and keep your...\\
412 - Whoops-a-daisy.\\
413 - Aw, you'll get it, ma'am.\\
414 - All you need's a bit of practice.\\
415 - Good luck to you.\\
416 - Thank you.\\
417 - (with Cockney accent): Ooh, I say,
governor,\\
418 - I think I've hurt my hip.\\
419 - Well, come on.
Enough of this.\\
420 - Let's go and have lunch, eh?
Now you're talk...\\
421 - No, I'm gonna stay right here\\
422 - and practice my curtseying.\\
423 - RICKY: How about you, Ethel?\\
424 - Well, I think I'll go with the
fellows, Lucy.\\
425 - I don't like to curtsey on an empty
stomach.\\
426 - Yeah.\\
427 - After we have lunch,\\
428 - we'd better go to International
Artists\\
429 - and talk to the fellow over there.\\
430 - FRED: Good idea, Rick.\\
431 - See you later, honey.\\
432 - Good-bye...\\
433 - Oh.\\
434 - Good-bye, dear.\\
435 - Good-bye, governor.\\
436 - See you later.\\
437 - Ooh.\\
438 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
439 - Hi.\\
440 - You're still rehearsing?\\
441 - Yes, sir, I'm right in the groove.\\
442 - Well, I think you'd better ungroove
yourself.\\
443 - Why, what do you mean?\\
444 - I hate to tell you this\\
445 - but I found out something this
afternoon.\\
446 - What?\\
447 - Well, the royal family has a special
room\\
448 - behind their box at the theater.\\
449 - They do?\\
450 - And it seems that only certain people\\
451 - get invited up there to be presented
to the queen.\\
452 - Oh, dear, what a shame.\\
453 - The Mertzes don't get to go.\\
454 - Well, they'll just have to keep a
stiff upper lip.\\
455 - Lucy...\\
456 - Hmm?\\
457 - Make it three stiff upper lips.\\
458 - What do you mean?\\
459 - Well, honey, I looked at the
invitation\\
460 - and it only says Ricky Ricardo.\\
461 - But surely they mean Ricky Ricardo
and wife\\
462 - or Ricky Ricardo and guest.\\
463 - I'll be a guest.\\
464 - Honey, no, it only says Ricky
Ricardo.\\
465 - I'm sorry, honey, but I don't know
what to do.\\
466 - Well, couldn't you call Buckingham
Palace\\
467 - and ask if you could bring a friend?\\
468 - I don't think it'll be right\\
469 - to question the queen's list.\\
470 - Besides, you know, the British people
think\\
471 - that Americans are a little forward
anyway,\\
472 - and I'm kind of representing the
American people.\\
473 - (whining): Oh, Ricky, I did so want
to meet the queen.\\
474 - (wailing)\\
475 - (wailing continues)\\
476 - Give me the International Artists
Agency, please.\\
477 - Uh, Philip Wilcox.\\
478 - Hello, Philip, this is Ricky Ricardo.\\
479 - Yes, fine, thank you.\\
480 - Listen, uh, I got a problem here.\\
481 - I'd like to ask your advice.\\
482 - Do you think it'll be all right\\
483 - if I bring my wife tomorrow night\\
484 - when I'm presented to the queen?\\
485 - No, her name is not on the list.\\
486 - I know, Philip,\\
487 - but she's dying to meet your queen.\\
488 - What was that, Philip?\\
489 - Ricky, I didn't mean for you to
really call Buckingham Palace.\\
490 - Oh, I see.\\
491 - Well, thanks a lot, Phil.\\
492 - Phil!\\
493 - I'll... I'll see you tomorrow night.\\
494 - Good-bye.\\
495 - What's the matter with you?\\
496 - Well, talk about Americans being
forward!\\
497 - And where did you ever get the
telephone number\\
498 - of Buckingham Palace?\\
499 - Buckingham...\\
500 - Oh, oh.\\
501 - (laughing)\\
502 - Is that what you thought?\\
503 - No, I was calling Philip Wilcox.\\
504 - That's my agent here in Europe.\\
505 - Oh.\\
506 - I just wanted to find out if he
thought\\
507 - it'd be all right to bring you
tomorrow.\\
508 - What'd he say?\\
509 - He said no. Your name is not on the
list,\\
510 - it's not proper.\\
511 - Oh, dear.\\
512 - He said it'd be different\\
513 - if... if you were in the show, you
know.\\
514 - If you were one of the entertainers\\
515 - or something, maybe he could...\\
516 - Ricky, Ricky, I've asked you\\
517 - to let me in that show before,\\
518 - but I never meant it as much as I do
this time.\\
519 - If you don't let me be in your show
at the Palladium,\\
520 - I'm gonna give you such a punch,\\
521 - you'll talk funnier than you do now!\\
522 - All right, all right.\\
523 - I know this is very important to you.\\
524 - You can be It is.	   in the
show.\\
525 - Oh, thank you, honey, thank you!\\
526 - Oh, baby, if you weren't already
married,\\
527 - I'd marry you.\\
528 - Now what can I do?\\
529 - Well, now, let me see, uh...\\
530 - How about that...\\
531 - Could you dance the lead\\
532 - in that, uh...
train horse number?\\
533 - Dance the lead? Yeah.\\
534 - Train horse number?
Yeah, yeah.\\
535 - The ponies.\\
536 - The circus pony number.\\
537 - Where I play the ringmaster.\\
538 - Yes, yes, I could.
Sure, I could.\\
539 - You haven't rehearsed it or...\\
540 - Well, I've seen it, I've seen it so
many times, honey, I...\\
541 - You sure you know all the steps?\\
542 - Yes, yes, I know all the steps.\\
543 - How about that...
They have to prance out.\\
544 - Yeah, how about that big leap\\
545 - they make through the loop and all
that stuff?\\
546 - I'd leap through fire and water to
see the queen.\\
547 - Yes, and I know how they prance
out...\\
548 - That's right and I got the whip and
the whistle.\\
549 - Ooh!\\
550 - Ooh!
What's the matter?\\
551 - Ooh, I got a little cramp in my leg.\\
552 - I guess my muscles are tired from all
that bowing.\\
553 - Well, are you sure you gonna be all
right tomorrow?\\
554 - Oh, certainly I'll be all right
tomorrow for heaven's sake.\\
555 - A little charley horse--\\
556 - that ought to be good for a pony
number.\\
557 - Ah-ha-ha!\\
558 - Oh...\\

592 - Fred, has Ricky come back from seeing
the queen?\\
593 - No. How's Lucy?\\
594 - Oh, she hasn't been able\\
595 - to get the charley horse out of her
leg yet.\\
596 - I never thought I'd see the day\\
597 - when Lucy'd turn down an introduction
to the queen.\\
598 - Well, she's so embarrassed.\\
599 - She thinks she made a fool of herself
in that number\\
600 - and she can't curtsey.\\
601 - And she won't meet the queen if she
can't curtsey.\\
602 - Hi!
Oh, did you,\\
603 - did you meet the queen?
What was she like?\\
604 - Oh, Ethel, she is the most\\
605 - charming and gracious lady I have
ever met.\\
606 - Oh, I knew she would be.\\
607 - What about the duke?
Is he a pretty good joe?\\
608 - Just as charming as she was.\\
609 - Listen, how's Lucy?\\
610 - Oh, she feels terrible.\\
611 - She's so disappointed.\\
612 - Well, wait till she hears what I
gotta tell her.\\
613 - What?\\
614 - Well, the queen has requested\\
615 - to meet the lady that did the comical
dancing.\\
616 - I'm going to tell her right now.\\
617 - Hey!\\
618 - This is like a command performance.\\
619 - Oh, this is gonna break her heart,
Fred.\\
620 - The poor little thing.\\
621 - Of all times to get a charley horse.\\
622 - I bet she goes.\\
623 - Oh, never.\\
624 - Well, this means a lot to her.\\
625 - Besides, it's a special invitation.\\
626 - But she can't curtsey.
I can tell...\\
627 - Going?\\
628 - Well, you won't believe this.\\
629 - She got into a curtsey position to
see if she could do it\\
630 - and she can't get out of it.\\
631 - Oh, well, that's that.\\
632 - Oh, no, that's not.\\
633 - Wait till you see.\\
634 - She got a couple of ushers and
well...\\
635 - See for yourself.\\

1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - ANNOUNCER: And now, "I Love Lucy."\\
3 - (applause)\\
4 - Boy, these English people\\
5 - are sure friendly.\\
6 - What a party!\\
7 - Well, I'm glad you had a good time.\\
8 - Didn't you?\\
9 - If you ask me, the English people\\
10 - are a little too friendly.\\
11 - Especially that drooling debutante\\
12 - you danced with all night.\\
13 - All night? How many times did I dance
with her?\\
14 - I'm sure I didn't count.\\
15 - Three times.\\
16 - Five.\\
17 - Three times.\\
18 - You danced with her three times.\\
19 - You intermissioned her twice.\\
20 - Now, honey, it's very flattering of
you to be jealous\\
21 - but I didn't ask her, she asked me.\\
22 - Can't you say no?\\
23 - Of course not. It's not polite.\\
24 - Don't forget, we're guests here in
London.\\
25 - You'd better learn how to be rude\\
26 - before we get to Paris.\\
27 - Now, honey, that girl is just a fan.\\
28 - She saw my last performance\\
29 - at the Palladium.\\
30 - I have to be nice to my public.\\
31 - Oh, sure-- your pretty, young public.\\
32 - You weren't being very nice\\
33 - to all of those ugly, old public
sitting around.\\
34 - Angela Randall is just a nice,\\
35 - stagestruck girl.\\
36 - Aha!\\
37 - "Aha" what?\\
38 - You know her name.\\
39 - Of course I know her name.\\
40 - Yeah, well... ha-ha!\\
41 - What's wrong with asking her name?\\
42 - Well, everybody makes a mistake once
in a while.\\
43 - What?!\\
44 - Honey, I danced with the girl three
times.\\
45 - I'll probably never see her again.\\
46 - You don't have to start an
international "instant."\\
47 - I'll start over whatever I want\\
48 - (phone ringing)
with an international incident.\\
49 - Oh, look, you woke up...\\
50 - I can do what I want about it.\\
51 - You woke up everybody in the hotel.\\
52 - I don't care who I woke up!\\
53 - Ay-ay-ay.\\
54 - Hello.\\
55 - Yeah, speaking.\\
56 - Who?\\
57 - Oh.\\
58 - Oh, yes.\\
59 - Yes, sir, I have certainly heard of
you, sir.\\
60 - Well, I'd be delighted to.\\
61 - Tomorrow morning?\\
62 - Wonderful.\\
63 - Good-bye.\\
64 - Who was that?\\
65 - That was Sir Clive Richardson.\\
66 - The Sir Clive Richardson?\\
67 - Yeah. He wants to talk to me about a
picture deal.\\
68 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
69 - You know, there's a whole layout of
him\\
70 - on the London Times today.\\
71 - Really?
Look.\\
72 - On his country estate.\\
73 - It's called Berkshire Manor.\\
74 - See, that's Sir Clive right there on
his horse.\\
75 - Oh, yeah.
"Sir Clive Richardson,\\
76 - well-known cinema producer,\\
77 - is pictured above, just after riding
to hounds."\\
78 - "Riding to hounds"?
What's that?\\
79 - Oh, honestly, Ricky.\\
80 - Don't they do anything in Cuba?\\
81 - That's what they call fox hunting.\\
82 - Oh, oh.\\
83 - Oh, gee, what I wouldn't give if Sir
Clive would invite us\\
84 - to his country estate for the
weekend.\\
85 - Ricky, you've just got to get us an
invitation.\\
86 - I don't gotta do nothing; I haven't
even met the man.\\
87 - Oh, but it'll be so easy.
He'll be right here.\\
88 - All you have to do is ask him.\\
89 - Oh, honey, don't be ridiculous.\\
90 - I couldn't do a thing like that.\\
91 - Well, I could.\\
92 - Lucy, you don't want to be a moocher,
do you?\\
93 - Just call me "Minnie."\\
94 - Now, look, I forbid you to ask him.\\
95 - Oh, I won't come right out and ask
him.\\
96 - I'll just... hint around, you know.\\
97 - Nothing doing.
Just forget it.\\
98 - But, honey, it's such a big estate.\\
99 - 300 acres-- they wouldn't even know
we were there.\\
100 - Now, Lucy, American tourists have\\
101 - a reputation for being pushy\\
102 - and I don't want to add to that
reputation.\\
103 - Oh...\\
104 - Now, listen, promise me.\\
105 - No hinting, no word, no nothing.\\
106 - Oh...\\
107 - Promise?\\
108 - All right, I'll promise!\\
109 - Don't be so pushy.\\
110 - (knock at door)\\
111 - Is the coast clear?\\
112 - Yeah. Ricky's getting dressed.\\
113 - He's been trying to get rid of me all
morning.\\
114 - I'll bet.\\
115 - Did you get it?\\
116 - I did.\\
117 - The right size?
I know your size.\\
118 - Now, you know the plan.
Yes.\\
119 - We telephone you at exactly 11:30.\\
120 - Right.\\
121 - Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk,
tsk...\\
122 - What's the matter with you?\\
123 - How come we always get sucked into
Lucy's wild schemes?\\
124 - Because we're a couple of shnooks,
that's why.\\
125 - Okay, I just wanted to know.\\
126 - Lucy.\\
127 - Yeah?\\
128 - Uh, honey, do you think\\
129 - you could get us invited for the
weekend, too?\\
130 - No. Now, Ethel, I can only wangle for
two.\\
131 - Well, as long as you're wangling for
two, it...\\
132 - No, now, honey, two is just right.\\
133 - Four would be overwangling.\\
134 - Shh.\\
135 - ETHEL: Oh, hi, Rick.\\
136 - FRED: Hi, Rick.
Hi.\\
137 - Uh, we just, uh, dropped in to say
good-bye.\\
138 - We're going someplace.\\
139 - Good. I was expecting a guest.\\
140 - Why don't you take Lucy with you?\\
141 - Oh, I've already been there.\\
142 - Why don't you go again, dear?\\
143 - Well, I didn't like it the first
time.\\
144 - What didn't you like the first time?\\
145 - Wherever they're going.\\
146 - She didn't like it.\\
147 - No, I didn't.\\
148 - No, she didn't.\\
149 - Well, good-bye, Rick.\\
150 - We'll see you later.\\
151 - So long, Rick.\\
152 - We'll talk to you later.
Okay.\\
153 - Come on.
Bye.\\
154 - Come on, Fred.
Bye.\\
155 - Lucy, uh...\\
156 - why don't you go shopping\\
157 - or-or, you know, go sightseeing, take
a bus ride.\\
158 - Right here, spend some money-- go
ahead.\\
159 - You wouldn't by any chance\\
160 - be trying to get rid of me, would
you?\\
161 - Who, me?\\
162 - Why, honey, how can you say such a
thing?\\
163 - It's just that Sir Clive is coming
over,\\
164 - and there'll be a lot of boring talk,
you know.\\
165 - Yeah, well, I happen to be very fond
of boring talk.\\
166 - It's one of my hobbies.\\
167 - I took it in high school-- "Boring
Talk 1A."\\
168 - (phone rings)\\
169 - Yes?\\
170 - Sir Clive?\\
171 - Oh, ask him to come up, please.\\
172 - Thank you.\\
173 - Lucy...
Hmm?\\
174 - remember your promise.\\
175 - No hinting about a weekend
invitation.\\
176 - I won't say a word.\\
177 - (knock at door)\\
178 - Mr. Ricardo?
Sir Clive!\\
179 - How are you, sir?
How do you do?\\
180 - I'm very glad to see you.\\
181 - May I help you with your coat?\\
182 - Thanks very much.
Yes, sir.\\
183 - Come right in, please.\\
184 - Oh.\\
185 - Oh, Sir Clive, this is my wife, Lucy.\\
186 - Delighted.\\
187 - Oh, it is in-indeed an honor\\
188 - to meet you, Sir Clive, sir.\\
189 - Oh, no trouble, no trouble.\\
190 - Will you be seated?\\
191 - Thank you, thank you, thank you.\\
192 - Uh, Sir Clive, you know,\\
193 - I want to tell you something.\\
194 - Last night when you called me\\
195 - after you revealed your identity,\\
196 - I was completely flabbergasted.\\
197 - You could have knocked me over with a
feather.\\
198 - I beg your pardon?\\
199 - Oh, uh, oh, Ricky said last night
when you called\\
200 - and revealed your identity,\\
201 - he was completely flabbergasted.\\
202 - You-you could have knocked him over
with a feather.\\
203 - He was that surprised.\\
204 - Oh, oh, quite, yes.\\
205 - Yes, uh, yes, I-I must explain that
call.\\
206 - My daughter's idea, you know.\\
207 - She's quite a fan of yours.\\
208 - She thinks that you would be
absolutely smashing\\
209 - in the British cinema.\\
210 - Oh.\\
211 - Yeah, well...\\
212 - Oh.\\
213 - Oh, Sir Clive said that\\
214 - he wanted to explain about the call.\\
215 - It was his daughter's idea.\\
216 - She's a fan of yours,\\
217 - and she thinks you'd be a big hit in
British movies.\\
218 - Oh!\\
219 - He says, "Oh!"\\
220 - Oh.\\
221 - He says, "Oh."\\
222 - Well, if you'll excuse me,\\
223 - I know you both have scads of things
to talk about.\\
224 - So, uh, I'll see you a little later,
perhaps.\\
225 - Yes, very good, yes.\\
226 - Uh, Mr. Ricardo, uh, my daughter
tells me\\
227 - that you've just recently finished a
cinema in America.\\
228 - A cinnamon in America?\\
229 - Yes. She said you've just completed
one.\\
230 - Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes!\\
231 - I-I-I just completed a cinnamon in
America.\\
232 - I beg your pardon?\\
233 - What you just said, I did it.\\
234 - Oh!\\
235 - The cinema, the cinema!\\
236 - Yes.\\
237 - Yes.\\
238 - ...so that after we finish this
European tour,\\
239 - I don't have any other engagements.\\
240 - Splendid, splendid.\\
241 - Say, I must be doing better.\\
242 - I must be talking a lot better.\\
243 - You understood the last two things I
said.\\
244 - I say!\\
245 - What?\\
246 - You know, I must be improving, too.\\
247 - You understood me.\\
248 - (laughing): Yes, yes.\\
249 - Well, you know, just give us a little
time.\\
250 - We'll get along fine.\\
251 - Well, I'm sure we will.
Yes, indeed.\\
252 - Tallyho.\\
253 - Lucy, what's that?\\
254 - What's what?\\
255 - That.\\
256 - Oh, oh, this is my new outfit for the
weekend.\\
257 - Charming.\\
258 - Thank you, Sir Clive.\\
259 - But we are not going anyplace\\
260 - for the weekend.\\
261 - Oh, didn't I tell you?\\
262 - Tell me what?\\
263 - Well, you know, my fondest dream\\
264 - has always been to spend a weekend\\
265 - on one of those fabulous English
country estates.\\
266 - My dream has finally come true.\\
267 - The earl has invited us.\\
268 - The earl? What earl?\\
269 - Didn't I tell you?\\
270 - It seems to be a lot of things\\
271 - that you didn't tell me.\\
272 - Well, Fred and Ethel--\\
273 - they're our friends, the Mertzes--\\
274 - uh, met this earl in the lobby.\\
275 - The Mertzes met an earl in the lobby?\\
276 - Yes.\\
277 - And one thing led to another,\\
278 - before they knew it,\\
279 - the earl had invited us to his
country estate\\
280 - for a ripping weekend of riding and
shooting\\
281 - just like we do at home.\\
282 - Oh, I say, which earl is it?\\
283 - I mean, what's the chap's name?\\
284 - How was that again?\\
285 - He wants to know the earl's name.\\
286 - I heard him.\\
287 - Well, what is his name?\\
288 - Uh...
You know,\\
289 - I know most of the fellows down
there.\\
290 - Uh, Earl of, uh, Gloucester?\\
291 - Mm...\\
292 - Earl of, uh, Twickenham?\\
293 - I know-- Earl of Chichester.\\
294 - No, uh...\\
295 - No, I think it's the, uh, Earl of
Wilson.\\
296 - Earl of Wilson?\\
297 - Yes, he's a new one.\\
298 - He's just been promoted from
assistant earl.\\
299 - Oh, well, very well.\\
300 - The country down there\\
301 - simply crawling with earls, isn't it?\\
302 - Yes, isn't it?\\
303 - (laughs)\\
304 - Uh, by the way, evidently, you must
be\\
305 - quite a horsewoman, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
306 - Oh... oh, quite.\\
307 - Oh, what a shame.\\
308 - If I'd only known,\\
309 - you could have come down to my place
for the weekend.\\
310 - Oh, well, that's very sweet of you,
Sir Clive,\\
311 - but thanks just the same.\\
312 - Oh...\\
313 - (phone rings)\\
314 - I'll get it.\\
315 - I'll get it, dear.\\
316 - I'll get it.\\
317 - Hello.\\
318 - What's that?\\
319 - Oh, you don't say.\\
320 - Oh... oh, well, give him my best.\\
321 - Another time?\\
322 - Well, I'm afraid that would be
impossible.\\
323 - You see, we're leaving the country.\\
324 - It's quite all right. Good-bye.\\
325 - Drat the luck!\\
326 - Trouble?\\
327 - The earl's got the gout\\
328 - and had to cancel our weekend
invitation.\\
329 - My dream bubble has burst.\\
330 - Well, now, perhaps not.\\
331 - What do you mean, Sir Clive?\\
332 - Now, you're, you're perfectly free\\
333 - to come to my place for the weekend.\\
334 - No, no, Sir Clive.
Oh, no, no.\\
335 - We wouldn't think of barging in, my
goodness.\\
336 - Not at all, I insist.\\
337 - And, and bring your friends, too.\\
338 - Four strangers dropping in on you for
the weekend?\\
339 - A glorious weekend where I would have\\
340 - the most memorable experience of my
life?\\
341 - I wouldn't hear of it.\\
342 - Oh, no trouble at all.\\
343 - No trouble.\\
344 - No, no, it's just, uh, too pushy.\\
345 - Oh, well, of course, if you feel like
that...\\
346 - I mean, I...
But...\\
347 - if you insist.\\
348 - Good show.\\
349 - We'll have the most ripping weekend.\\
350 - Oh, right-o!\\
351 - And, by the way, we can talk business\\
352 - down there, too, you know.\\
353 - Well, yes, sir, yes, that would be
fine.\\
354 - Thank you.
(phone rings)\\
355 - I'll get it, dear.\\
356 - Hello.\\
357 - Yes, Sir Clive is here.\\
358 - Oh, by all means, send her up.\\
359 - Your daughter is here.\\
360 - Oh, yes, yes, I asked her to pick me
up here.\\
361 - We are lunching together.\\
362 - Oh. Oh, well, if you'll excuse me,
then,\\
363 - I'll be right back.\\
364 - Charming woman, your wife.\\
365 - Charming.\\
366 - Uh, Sir Clive, I'm very anxious, uh,\\
367 - to meet your daughter.\\
368 - You said she's a fan of mine?\\
369 - But you have already met her.\\
370 - You danced with her last night.\\
371 - I did?\\
372 - Richardson?\\
373 - No, no. Angela doesn't use her family
name.\\
374 - Um, she's an actress, you know.\\
375 - Uses a stage name: Randall.\\
376 - Your daughter is Angela Randall?\\
377 - Rather!\\
378 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!\\
379 - I beg your pardon?\\
380 - Oh, oh, uh, uh, that's an American
expression.\\
381 - It means "blimey."\\
382 - Oh!\\
383 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-- blimey.\\
384 - (knock at door)\\
385 - She must be here.\\
386 - Hello, Angela.\\
387 - Hello, Ricky.\\
388 - I'm glad to see you.\\
389 - Hello, Father.
My dear.\\
390 - Hello. I believe\\
391 - we met last night.\\
392 - Uh... she's your daughter?\\
393 - Yes. Angela Randall is her stage
name.\\
394 - I just found out.\\
395 - Isn't that funny?\\
396 - (uneasy chuckle)\\
397 - Hilarious.\\
398 - Father, did you have\\
399 - your little business talk with Ricky?\\
400 - Well, only partly.\\
401 - Yeah, we didn't get quite finished,\\
402 - but it's all right because your
father\\
403 - has asked us over to your place for
the weekend.\\
404 - Uh, yes, but unfortunately, we will
not be able to accept.\\
405 - Oh, but you accepted just now, you
know.\\
406 - Uh, yes, but dash it all, I just
remembered,\\
407 - we're scheduled to go to the cricket
matches this weekend.\\
408 - At this time of year?\\
409 - Cricket's out of season.\\
410 - Well, these are young crickets.\\
411 - Don't worry, Sir Clive, we'll be
there.\\
412 - Oh, marvelous, Ricky.\\
413 - It'll be such fun!\\
414 - It'll be just ripping!\\
415 - Come along, Father.
Yes, thank you.\\
416 - Good-bye.\\
417 - It'll be such fun to have you down
with us.\\
418 - Well, I'd love to.\\
419 - May I help you with your hat, sir?\\
420 - No, thank you.
I'll just carry it.\\
421 - Well, I'll be seeing you all
Saturday.\\
422 - Cheerio.\\
423 - RICKY: Good-bye.\\
424 - Cheerio.\\
425 - "Cheerio."\\
426 - Ricky, we are not going!\\
427 - Oh, yes, we're going.\\
428 - I wouldn't want to burst your dream
bubble.\\
429 - My dream did not include a washed-out
blond\\
430 - named Angela Randall.\\
431 - You knew she was Sir Clive's daughter
all along.\\
432 - I did not know any such thing.\\
433 - You did, too!
I didn't know anything.\\
434 - But you accepted, and we're going.\\
435 - You opened your big mouth and you put
your foot in it.\\
436 - Tallyho! Tallyho!\\
437 - (hounds baying)\\
438 - You're invited, you're invited.\\
439 - Ethel, have you seen Ricky anywhere?\\
440 - Yeah, I think he's out with Angela
someplace.\\
441 - I know that, but where are they this
time?\\
442 - I think she's showing him the rock
garden.\\
443 - Yesterday it was the rose garden.\\
444 - This morning it was the stable, then
the grape arbor.\\
445 - What's she doing, auditioning him for
caretaker?\\
446 - Oh, honey, you're making too much out
of this.\\
447 - Well, how long does it take to look
at a rock garden?\\
448 - What are they doing, prospecting for
uranium?\\
449 - Lucy, you're being silly about this.\\
450 - Listen, if she was monopolizing Fred,\\
451 - and you never got to see him, what
would you say?\\
452 - I'd say, "Jolly good show, Angela,
old bean. Have at it."\\
453 - You would not.\\
454 - I'll tell you one thing.\\
455 - I'm not letting them out of my sight
again.\\
456 - Oh, Lucy.\\
457 - Oh, there you are, Lucy.\\
458 - We looked all over for you.\\
459 - We wanted you to see the rock garden
with us.\\
460 - Sure you did.\\
461 - Hi, honey.\\
462 - Hello, stranger.\\
463 - I didn't realize it,\\
464 - but I guess I've been monopolizing
Ricky\\
465 - ever since he got here.\\
466 - What must you think?\\
467 - Would you really like to know, huh?\\
468 - Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, it must be time
for tea.\\
469 - I'm just famished!\\
470 - Uh, where are Sir Clive and Fred?\\
471 - Oh, they're down by the stable.\\
472 - Well, now, let's all\\
473 - go down there and get them, huh?\\
474 - Ricky, be a dear and show her the
way.\\
475 - I've been wanting to chat with Lucy.\\
476 - All right.\\
477 - Lucy, dear...\\
478 - Yes, Angela?\\
479 - My dearest friend, Cecily Higgins,\\
480 - is having a lawn party tomorrow,\\
481 - and I was wondering, might I borrow
Ricky?\\
482 - Well, yes, you might borrow him\\
483 - if I could go along as collateral.\\
484 - Oh. Well, that's kind of
embarrassing.\\
485 - You see, Father's car is in the shop\\
486 - and all we have is my little sports
runabout,\\
487 - and it only seats two.\\
488 - Oh. Well, maybe you could strap me\\
489 - on the fender like a deer.\\
490 - Oh, now, Lucy, you aren't going\\
491 - to get into a stew, are you?\\
492 - You could feed the whole British Army\\
493 - on the stew I'm going to get into.\\
494 - But I promised Cecily I'd be there.\\
495 - She's always managing to get
celebrities\\
496 - at her country estate,\\
497 - and I just want to take Ricky down
there to show him off.\\
498 - He's a prize.\\
499 - Yes, well, that prize\\
500 - belongs in my box of Cracker Jacks.\\
501 - Oh, dear!\\
502 - ETHEL: Well, come on.\\
503 - Here they are. I found them down at
the stable.\\
504 - Angela, my dear, I've had a perfectly
topping idea.\\
505 - In honor of our American guests,\\
506 - I've arranged for a fox hunt
tomorrow.\\
507 - Oh, wonderful, Father!\\
508 - How about it, Ricky?\\
509 - Fine, I'd love to.\\
510 - Will you join us, Lucy?\\
511 - You just know I will.\\
512 - Splendid!\\
513 - But, of course, you won't be able to
go, Angela.\\
514 - You promised to go to Cecily's party
tomorrow.\\
515 - Oh, silly me.\\
516 - Cecily's party is the day after
tomorrow.\\
517 - Oh.\\
518 - I can go to the fox hunt.\\
519 - Oh, splendid! Then that's all
settled.\\
520 - Now, how about a spot of tea?\\
521 - ETHEL: Yes, let's all go have some
tea.\\
522 - FRED: I'll enjoy that.\\
523 - ETHEL: You run along and have some,
Fred.\\
524 - FRED: All right.\\
525 - Lucy, why did you say you'd go on a
fox hunt?\\
526 - You've never been on a horse in your
life.\\
527 - Well, I don't care.\\
528 - I'm not letting them out of my sight.\\
529 - The fox isn't the only thing she's
hunting.\\
530 - Bye.
Good-bye.\\
531 - Hurry up, Lucy!\\
532 - FRED: Bring back the bacon, Rick.\\
533 - Okay.
Good-bye!\\
534 - Good luck!\\
535 - Psst!\\
536 - What?\\
537 - Lucy, what's the matter with you?\\
538 - I'm scared.\\
539 - Well, I should think you would be if
you've never\\
540 - been on a horse before.
Shh...!\\
541 - I don't want the horse to hear that.\\
542 - Lucy, this is dangerous.\\
543 - Not half as dangerous\\
544 - as leaving Ricky and Angela alone all
afternoon.\\
545 - Does Ricky know you've never been on
a horse before?\\
546 - No. I told him I rode a lot in Girl
Scout camp.\\
547 - You needn't be afraid, ma'am.\\
548 - Well, Danny Boy is the gentlest horse
in the stable.\\
549 - He looks kind of ferocious to me.\\
550 - Ah, gentle as a lamb, ma'am.\\
551 - Well, uh, haven't you got, maybe, a
smaller horse?\\
552 - No, ma'am.\\
553 - Have you got a large lamb?\\
554 - (laughing)\\
555 - You'd better get started, ma'am.\\
556 - Yeah, well, h-h-how do you get on
this animal?\\
557 - Well, just come right around this
side.\\
558 - Oh.\\
559 - Now, then, put your left foot up in
the stirrup.\\
560 - That's the stirrup.\\
561 - Left foot?
Yeah.\\
562 - Okay.
There she goes.\\
563 - There you go.\\
564 - Up!
Oh!\\
565 - Again, honey.\\
566 - (grunting)\\
567 - Fred, you help her.\\
568 - FRED: All right.\\
569 - Fred will help you.\\
570 - He'll help you now.\\
571 - Now, wait a minute.\\
572 - Let's get all together, huh, fellas?\\
573 - I'll, I'll, I'll count.\\
574 - One, two, three.\\
575 - Oh!\\
576 - Fred, I want to stay up on top.\\
577 - I don't want to go all the way over.\\
578 - I was only trying to help you.\\
579 - Well, you-you just don't know your
own strength.\\
580 - Come on.
I'm sorry,\\
581 - I'm sorry.\\
582 - I'll... I'll be able to make it.\\
583 - Shall we try this slippery beast
again?\\
584 - There we are.\\
585 - ETHEL: Up you go.\\
586 - I have to give a big...\\
587 - push.\\
588 - I'd like to oblige, ma'am,\\
589 - but I'm a rotten jumper.\\
590 - I'm sorry.\\
591 - Come on, now, honey.\\
592 - You'll make it this time.\\
593 - Shall we have another go at it?\\
594 - ETHEL: Here she goes, here she goes.\\
595 - (grunting)
Up she goes!\\
596 - Good girl!\\
597 - Just sit up, ma'am.\\
598 - Yeah, well, you ride your way, I'll
ride mine.\\
599 - (horn sounding fanfare)\\
600 - They're going, honey.
They're going.\\
601 - EHTEL: Hang on now!\\
602 - FRED: Hang on, Lucy!
Hang on!\\
603 - Hang on!
Hold on!\\
604 - Hold on!\\
605 - Oh, Fred, I'm worried about her.\\
606 - She didn't exactly look like Johnny
Longden\\
607 - sitting up there.\\
608 - You look at her.
I can't stand to look.\\
609 - (horn sounding fanfare)\\
610 - They're off and running.\\
611 - (yelling): Oh! Oh!\\
612 - Lucy!\\
613 - How do you steer this thing?\\
614 - You steer him with the reins, ma'am.\\
615 - You pull on the left rein to go left\\
616 - and on the right rein to go right.\\
617 - Yeah, well, where are the brakes?\\
618 - You just pull back on the reins,
ma'am, like that.\\
619 - Lucy, if you didn't know how to
steer,\\
620 - how did you get back here?\\
621 - I don't know.\\
622 - Oh, Danny Boy always comes back to
the stable\\
623 - if you let him have his head, ma'am.\\
624 - It comes straight in the backway
every time.\\
625 - I gotta go!
(horn sounding fanfare)\\
626 - Oh, you gotta go.\\
627 - FRED: Hang on now!\\
628 - Okay.
Hang on, Lucy!\\
629 - Hang on!
Hang on!\\
630 - Hang on tight!\\
631 - How's she doing, Fred?\\
632 - Well, I can't find her.
You can't find her?\\
633 - I can't find her.
She's disappeared!\\
634 - She's disappeared?\\
635 - Is there a horse without a rider?\\
636 - No!\\
637 - Is there a rider without a horse?\\
638 - No!\\
639 - Oh, let me look, Fred!\\
640 - Well, don't tear my head off.\\
641 - All right, but just let me look.\\
642 - I can't stand it.\\
643 - Oh, where could she be?\\
644 - I don't know.
She...\\
645 - How did you ever do that?\\
646 - Well, believe me, it wasn't easy.\\
647 - We went over a jump,\\
648 - and while I was up in the air,\\
649 - Danny Boy must have turned around.\\
650 - Oh, honey, please give this up.\\
651 - No, sir, Danny Boy and I\\

13 - Quite a village, eh, Rick?\\
14 - Isn't it great, Fred?\\
15 - Lucy, I'm so excited,\\
16 - I don't think I can stand it.\\
17 - LUCY: Oh...
What a town.\\
18 - Hasn't changed a bit.\\
19 - Everything is exactly the same as it
was in 1918.\\
20 - Present company excepted.\\
21 - Yeah.\\
22 - Listen, Fred,\\
23 - I have to see my French agent today,\\
24 - so you can take the day off.\\
25 - A day off in Paris?\\
26 - Hot ziggedy!\\
27 - You are coming on a sightseeing tour\\
28 - with Lucy and me.\\
29 - Cold ziggedy.\\
30 - No, Ethel, you and Fred take that
tour.\\
31 - What are you going to do?\\
32 - Oh, I kind of want to get off by
myself--\\
33 - you know, feel the pulse of the city,\\
34 - get the true flavor of Paris.\\
35 - Well, you can't go running around
Paris all by yourself.\\
36 - Why not?	What about your
French?\\
37 - What about my French?\\
38 - Well, Paris is a big city, and not
knowing the language,\\
39 - you're liable to get into a lot of
trouble.\\
40 - Oh, poo. When you first came to the
United States,\\
41 - you didn't get into a lot of trouble\\
42 - What?\\
43 - She told me that "I do" meant
"Pleased to meet you."\\
44 - And then she introduced me\\
45 - to the preacher.\\
46 - Just a minute, just a minute.\\
47 - What are you doing?\\
48 - I'm looking up the French for...\\
49 - While you're at it, look up "I am
lost.\\
50 - Take me to the Royal Hotel."\\
51 - Oh, now, honey, what can happen? How
can I get lost?\\
52 - I have my French dictionary,\\
53 - I have my guidebook, I have my map of
Paris.\\
54 - Don't try to fight it, Rick.\\
55 - Just call the American Embassy and
tell them to stand by.\\
56 - All right, but be careful, honey, eh?\\
57 - I will. Don't worry about me.\\
58 - Just give me some money.\\
59 - All right.\\
60 - I think I'll just wander around, and
who knows?\\
61 - I may discover an undiscovered artist\\
62 - whose paintings have never been
discovered.\\
63 - Sure, sure, you do that, yeah.\\
64 - Well, now, that's possible.\\
65 - I read about a man who bought a
painting for $2.98,\\
66 - and ten years later, it was worth
$50,000.\\
67 - Well! well, get me two dozen.\\
68 - Here. Here's 20 bucks.\\
69 - Take this to the American Express
office\\
70 - and they'll give you 7,000 francs.\\
71 - 7,000 francs? Wow!\\
72 - I like this better than English
money.\\
73 - It's the same in dollars.\\
74 - Oh, I know, but it sounds like more.\\
75 - Okay.\\
76 - Be careful now.
I will.\\
77 - Have a good time on your sightseeing
tour.\\
78 - So long, Rick.\\
79 - See you later, honey.\\
80 - Bye.
See you later.\\
81 - We'll go down to the Express office
with you, Lucy.\\
82 - I want to change some money\\
83 - and pick up the mail.
Okay.\\
84 - Well, Fred, I can't go looking like
this.\\
85 - Why not?\\
86 - Well, look at my hair.\\
87 - What's the matter?
It looks all right to me.\\
88 - It's up in curlers!\\
89 - Isn't that the way you always wear
it?\\
90 - No, that's not the way I always wear
it!\\
91 - We'll see you down at the Express
office later, honey.\\
92 - Okay.
Bye.\\
93 - Bye.\\
94 - It is pretty.
It is pretty.\\
95 - Pardon.\\
96 - C'est joli.\\
97 - Le painting...

98 - Oh, thank you very much.\\
99 - Oh, uh, you speak English.\\
100 - A little.\\
101 - Oh.\\

107 - Who, me?\\
108 - Madame is... uh...\\
109 - Madame is going in there\\
110 - to exchange American currency,
n'est-ce pas?\\
111 - Oui.\\
112 - Ah, ha. There is no need for madame\\
113 - to go all that way in there.\\
114 - I can do it for you right here.\\
115 - Oh?\\
116 - And, besides, in there,\\
117 - they give you only 350 francs for a
dollar.\\
118 - I can give you 450.\\
119 - Well...
(chuckles)\\
120 - gee, it's lucky I met you.\\
121 - Ah, Oui.\\
122 - I see madame has there a 20 dollar.\\
123 - Yes.
I can give you, uh...\\
124 - 9,000 francs.\\
125 - Oh, well, uh, just a second.\\
126 - How come you can give me more\\
127 - than the American Express can?\\
128 - Ah. Well, madame, it is very simple.\\
129 - You see there this big building?\\
130 - Yeah.
They pay high rent.\\
131 - I work out of doors, hmm?\\
132 - As you Americans say, no overhead.\\
133 - Oh... oh, well, that makes sense.\\
134 - Okay.\\
135 - Oh, merci.\\
136 - Merci, madame. Au revoir.\\
137 - Oh, uh, I have some friends meeting
me here,\\
138 - and I'm quite sure they'd like to
exchange their money, too.\\
139 - Ah, bon, madame, bon.\\
140 - Bon?\\

142 - Bon.\\
143 - Oh, bon!\\

150 - beaucoup de francais.\\
151 - Well, there you are.\\
152 - I just said, "Evidently, madame
speaks\\
153 - and understands a great deal of
French."\\
154 - Oh, I do, I do.\\
155 - Oui, oui.\\
156 - Madame, madame, au revoir.\\
157 - Oh, but my friends aren't here yet.\\
158 - Yes, I know, madame, but, uh...\\
159 - I just remembered an appointment...\\
160 - whoa, on the other side of town.\\
161 - Au revoir.\\
162 - Oh.\\
163 - Oh, hi, honey.
Hi.\\
164 - Hi, Fred, you just missed it.\\
165 - I met the most wonderful man, and he
changed my money\\
166 - and gave me 450 francs for each
dollar.\\
167 - A hundred extra francs for every
buck?\\
168 - Yeah.
Where is the guy?\\
169 - He's gone.
Where is he?\\
170 - Oh. Will he be back?\\
171 - I don't know.\\
172 - Look, I'll give you half of mine.\\
173 - Here, you give me $10,\\
174 - I'll give you...
4,500 francs.\\
175 - Oh, here, thanks, Lucy.\\
176 - Oh, that's awful sweet of you, honey.\\
177 - That's all right.
Thank you.\\
178 - Come on, we'll go and get the mail.\\
179 - We'll see you later.\\
180 - Thanks again.\\
181 - Okay.
Have a good time.\\
182 - That certainly is joli.\\
183 - Thank you.\\
184 - How much do you want for it?\\
185 - Oh, I never sell my paintings.\\
186 - You never sell them?\\
187 - No... never.\\
188 - I could not sell my paintings.\\
189 - You see, they are a part of me.\\
190 - I could not sell a picture\\
191 - any more than I could sell... my arm.\\
192 - Well... if you never sell your
paintings,\\
193 - how do you expect to be discovered?\\
194 - It is always the same.\\
195 - When I die, then I will be
discovered.\\
196 - Look... I just have to have one of
your paintings.\\
197 - I'll give you 500 francs for that.\\
198 - Oh... oh, I'm sorry, madame.\\
199 - This picture is... my life.\\
200 - It took me three years to paint.\\
201 - 600 Francs?\\
202 - Sell three years of my life for 600
francs?\\
203 - 700?\\
204 - Madame, I told you, no.\\
205 - I think I would turn down even a... a
thousand francs.\\
206 - A thousand.\\
207 - Oh, I'll take it.\\
208 - Oh, oh, well, thank you very much.\\
209 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
210 - Be very careful with it, madame.\\
211 - Oh, I will.
You see, it is still wet.\\
212 - Yes, yes, I will. I'll go right to
the hotel with it.\\
213 - Oh, thank you so much.\\
214 - By the way, what is your name?\\
215 - Pierre Charpentier.\\
216 - Pierre Charpentier.\\
217 - You see, after you die and become
famous,\\
218 - I want to be able to tell my friends\\
219 - that I discovered you,\\
220 - and that I have an original
Charpentier.\\
221 - Well, it's been awfully nice
discovering you, Pierre.\\
222 - Oh, it was wonderful being
discovered.\\
223 - Au revoir.\\
224 - Au revoir.\\

\subsection {Episode 19: Lucy Meets Charles Boyer}
1 - (theme song ending)\\
2 - ANNOUNCER: And now, "I Love Lucy."\\
3 - (applause)\\
4 - Oh, boy, this is good French pastry!\\
5 - (clears throat)\\
6 - Ethel, there he is.\\
7 - There who is?
Charles Boyer.\\
8 - Where?
Right here.\\
9 - Oh, not again.\\
10 - Honey, this is the fifth time\\
11 - you've seen Charles Boyer today.\\
12 - That is the back of his head.\\
13 - I will know it anywhere.\\
14 - In Hollywood, every guy you passed\\
15 - in the street was Clark Gable.\\
16 - In Paris, it's Charles Boyer.\\
17 - I don't care.\\
18 - I have seen every picture he ever
made\\
19 - and if that isn't...\\
20 - Well, that's the way he would look if
he had a beard.\\
21 - I'm getting sick and tired of you\\
22 - and your imaginary Charles Boyers.\\
23 - I don't want to hear another word
about it.\\
24 - All right, all right.\\
25 - You don't have to get mad.\\
26 - I think he's jealous.\\
27 - Lucy, are you going to finish that
pastry?\\
28 - No. Go ahead, help yourself.\\
29 - (cackling)\\
30 - Fred, did you get the itinerary for
Europe yet?\\
31 - Yeah. We're going to stay over here
in Europe\\
32 - a lot longer than we planned.\\
33 - OTHERS: We are?\\
34 - FRED: Here's a list of the places
we're playing.\\
35 - Well, that's good.\\
36 - If you want to see someone\\
37 - who looks more like that man I keep
seeing\\
38 - than anyone we've seen yet, look over
there.\\
39 - Lucy!\\
40 - This time, I'm positive!\\
41 - Come on.
Come on, let's...\\
42 - Just a minute.\\
43 - Quiet down.\\
44 - Why? What's the matter?\\
45 - You're not going to go over.\\
46 - Why not?\\
47 - Because something awful is bound to
happen.\\
48 - Oh, don't be silly.
What could happen?\\
49 - I don't know, I don't know,\\
50 - but I don't want to be embarrassed.\\
51 - You somehow or other seem to attract
trouble.\\
52 - Oh, give me one good example\\
53 - where I ever attracted trouble.\\
54 - All right. We arrived in Paris,\\
55 - you went sightseeing,\\
56 - and we all wound up in jail as
counterfeiters.\\
57 - That could have happened to anyone.\\
58 - All right, in Hollywood,\\
59 - you went to the Brown Derby for
dinner,\\
60 - and Bill Holden ended up with a face
full of pie.\\
61 - That was purely an accident.\\
62 - Van Johnson.\\
63 - Well, that...\\
64 - John Wayne.\\
65 - That was not my fault.\\
66 - Come on, let's go. Come on.\\
67 - Just a minute.\\
68 - You can't go over there like that.\\
69 - Why? What's the matter?\\
70 - Uh, you need lipstick.\\
71 - Oh, I do?
Oh, you do, honey.\\
72 - We'd better fix your face up a
little.\\
73 - He hasn't ordered yet.\\
74 - It's him.
Yeah.\\
75 - I just want to get rid of him.\\
76 - I got an idea. I'm going to go over
there and talk to him.\\
77 - Yeah, let's go have a chat...\\
78 - Sit down, will you?\\
79 - Two cornballs in this outfit is
enough.\\
80 - Excuse me.
I'm Ricky Ricardo.\\
81 - Oh, oh, yes, of course.
How are you?\\
82 - I'm glad to see you.
Sit down.\\
83 - Thank you.\\
84 - My agent cabled me about having lunch
with you\\
85 - sometime this week.\\
86 - I was going to call you at your
hotel.\\
87 - Oh.
I think it's about\\
88 - doing some television shows in the
States\\
89 - on Four Star Playhouse.\\
90 - Yes, well, uh, I didn't come over to
talk business with you.\\
91 - I came over to warn you.\\
92 - Warn me? About what?\\
93 - Well...\\
94 - have you ever heard about my wife?\\
95 - Oh, yes, yes. Uh, her name is Lucy,
is that it?\\
96 - That's right, yeah.\\
97 - Yes, yes, I heard all those publicity
stories about her.\\
98 - Yeah, well, I got news for you.\\
99 - Those were not publicity stories.\\
100 - You mean they were true?\\
101 - Yes.\\
102 - Well, she must... she must, she must
be quite a character.\\
103 - Well, she's, uh... more than just a
character.\\
104 - She's a... a...\\
105 - Oh, yes, yes, we have a word for her
in French:\\
106 - balle de vis.\\
107 - What does that mean?\\
108 - Screwball.\\
109 - That's the word.\\
110 - That's exactly the word.\\
111 - Well, look, she's coming over here\\
112 - to ask for your autograph.\\
113 - Play it safe-- tell her you're not
Charles Boyer.\\
114 - Well, she certainly can see that...\\
115 - I know, but she's already seen ten
men today\\
116 - that she thought was you.\\
117 - So, just tell her that she made
another mistake.\\
118 - All right, Charles?\\
119 - Charles? But I think you made a
mistake, monsieur.\\
120 - My name is Maurice, Maurice DuBois.\\
121 - Thank you very much, Mr. DuBois.\\
122 - It'll be a pleasure having lunch with
you\\
123 - later on in the week.\\
124 - Good-bye, Mr. Ricardo.
Thank you.\\
125 - (chuckling)\\
126 - Oh, he's a nice fellow.\\
127 - I've been watching him, Rick, and I
don't know.\\
128 - What do dames see in him?\\
129 - Well, I guess he's...\\
130 - What's he got that I haven't got?\\
131 - Nothing.\\
132 - It's just what you got that he hasn't
got\\
133 - that louses you up.\\
134 - We'll be right back.\\
135 - RICKY: Mm-hmm.\\
136 - Pardon me.\\
137 - Uh, I'm Lucy Ricardo,\\
138 - and this is my friend, Ethel Mertz.\\
139 - (giddily): Oh, Mr. Boyer, how do you
do?\\
140 - It's happened again!\\
141 - What?\\
142 - I'm terribly sorry to disappoint you,
lady,\\
143 - but I'm afraid you've made a mistake.\\
144 - Oh?\\
145 - Yes. People are always taking me for
Charles Boyer,\\
146 - but I'm not.\\
147 - My name is Maurice, Maurice DuBois.\\
148 - Oh... oh.\\
149 - Personally, I don't understand\\
150 - why people make the mistake.\\
151 - Well, now that I see you up closer,\\
152 - I can tell that you're not Boyer.\\
153 - Sorry to disappoint you, ladies.\\
154 - You know, you don't even sound like
him, does he?\\
155 - No.\\
156 - Well, good.\\
157 - You know, that whole resemblance to
Boyer\\
158 - has been my downfall.\\
159 - Oh, how come?\\
160 - Well, you see I am actor, too.
Oh.\\
161 - And because I look like him,\\
162 - producers will not hire me.\\
163 - And between you and me,\\
164 - I am a much better actor than he is.\\
165 - Oh, come now.\\
166 - I happen to think that Charles Boyer\\
167 - is a marvelous actor.\\
168 - He is the greatest.\\
169 - Ha!\\
170 - Well, that's sour grapes if I ever
heard it.\\
171 - Well, huh, you can hardly blame me.\\
172 - It has changed my whole life.\\
173 - Oh, well, I can understand that.\\
174 - Well, sorry we bothered you, Mr.,
uh...\\
175 - Eh, DuBois.\\
176 - Oh, yes.
Well, um...\\
177 - uh, see you, uh, later.\\
178 - Good-bye. I'm sorry I'm not Charles
Boyer.\\
179 - That makes three of us.\\
180 - I could have sworn that was him.\\
181 - Yeah.
Huh?\\
182 - Oh.
Come on, let's go.\\
183 - Oh, you get your autograph?\\
184 - No. That wasn't Charles Boyer.\\
185 - Are you kidding?\\
186 - No.
No, it was some ham actor\\
187 - named Maurice DuBois.\\
188 - Oh, what do you know.\\
189 - He looked so much like Boyer.\\
190 - Nah, not really.
Come on.\\
191 - (knock at door)\\
192 - Oh, come in, Fred.\\
193 - Hi, Rick.
What do you want?\\
194 - Listen, did you give out any
publicity\\
195 - about me having luncheon with Charles
Boyer this week.\\
196 - Of course not.\\
197 - That must have been Don Sharp.\\
198 - What's the matter?
These agents.\\
199 - See the Paris Tribune?\\
200 - No.\\
201 - Listen to this.\\
202 - "International Note."\\
203 - "Cuban Ricky Ricardo and French
Charles Boyer\\
204 - "have a luncheon engagement this week
here in Paris\\
205 - to discuss a deal for American
television."\\
206 - Uh-oh.\\
207 - How am I gonna keep Lucy away from
this luncheon?\\
208 - Well, you could lock her in the
closet.\\
209 - Cut it out, will you?\\
210 - No, you know what I was thinking?\\
211 - You know, the other day at that
restaurant\\
212 - when I said to her that I was sick
and tired\\
213 - of her imaginary Charles Boyer?\\
214 - She thought I was jealous, right?\\
215 - Uh-huh.\\
216 - Well, what if I put on a big act\\
217 - and make her really think that I'm
jealous?\\
218 - You're not that good an actor.\\
219 - Is that so?\\
220 - Ricky... did you see Buchwald's
column?\\
221 - Yes.\\
222 - Are you really having lunch with
Boyer?\\
223 - Yes, I am.\\
224 - Can I go with you?
No.\\
225 - But Ricky!\\
226 - I said no.\\
227 - (whining): Oh, why can't I go?\\
228 - Mr. Boyer is my idol.\\
229 - He's so romantic.
How can I leave Paris...\\
230 - (shouting): I said, "No!"\\
231 - I am sick and tired of hearing you
talk about him.\\
232 - "Charles Boyer, Charles Boyer,
Charles Boyer."\\
233 - What is he, the end of the earth or
something?\\
234 - Well, no, he's just...\\
235 - Yeeees, you just said what he was!\\
236 - He's your idol!\\
237 - "He's so romantic!" (grunts)\\
238 - Why, Ricky, you're jealous.\\
239 - Jealous? Ha!\\
240 - You are.\\
241 - Fred, will you pardon me?
This is a private matter.\\
242 - Please.
I'll be glad to.\\
243 - Thank you.\\
244 - All right, now you know my secret.\\
245 - I am jealous-- insanely jealous!\\
246 - But, honey, you have nothing to be
jealous about.\\
247 - Charles Boyer, he's just a movie
star.\\
248 - I haven't even met him.\\
249 - And you're not going to.\\
250 - Huh... huh...\\
251 - Why would I introduce a charming man\\
252 - like Charles Boyer to a gorgeous
redhead like you?\\
253 - Well...\\
254 - You're not even going to get near
him.\\
255 - Do you hear me?\\
256 - You're mine, mine, all mine!\\
257 - Wow! Who needs Boyer?\\
258 - You don't, that's who.\\
259 - Darling, I have to leave you now,\\
260 - but I'll be back to your arms as soon
as I can.\\
261 - (weakly): All right.\\
262 - Wait for me, my love.\\
263 - I will.\\
264 - Good-bye, my sweet.\\
265 - Good-bye.\\
266 - My goodness!\\
267 - Lucy, Lucy, is it true?\\
268 - Is he really going to have lunch with
Charles Boyer?\\
269 - Oh, boy, this is your big
opportunity, huh?\\
270 - No, Ethel, I'm not going.\\
271 - Why not?\\
272 - I have a big problem.\\
273 - Ricky is insanely jealous of Charles
Boyer.\\
274 - (cackling)\\
275 - Oh, Lucy.\\
276 - He is. You should have seen him.\\
277 - He was so mad, he was snorting like a
bull,\\
278 - and his eyes bugged out something
awful.\\
279 - Worse than they usually do?\\
280 - Yeah.\\
281 - What's your big problem?\\
282 - I should think you'd be delighted.\\
283 - Well, it's flattering, but it's also
very disturbing.\\
284 - How would you feel if-if Fred were
smoldering with jealousy?\\
285 - Fred wouldn't smolder if he backed
into a blowtorch.\\
286 - I've just got to do something to
prove to him\\
287 - that Charles Boyer doesn't mean a
thing to me.\\
288 - What can you possibly do?\\
289 - Well...\\
290 - listen, do you remember that actor we
met in that restaurant?\\
291 - That... that Maurice...\\
292 - DuBois, the one that looks like
Boyer?\\
293 - Yeah. Ricky thought he really was
Charles Boyer, right?\\
294 - He sure did.\\
295 - Well, I'm going to ask Maurice DuBois
to come up here\\
296 - and make love to me right in front of
Ricky.\\
297 - And I won't pay a bit of attention to
him,\\
298 - see? And when Ricky sees that I'm not
a bit impressed,\\
299 - he'll realize that he has nothing to
be jealous about.\\
300 - Oh, boy, this is one of your crazy
schemes\\
301 - you can leave me out of.\\
302 - Who asked you in?\\
303 - Well, you always do drag me into your
crazy schemes.\\
304 - Well, this is one time I can do
without you.\\
305 - What's wrong with me all of a sudden?\\
306 - Well, nothing, but this, I can handle
by myself.\\
307 - I know this sounds crazy, but I feel
left out.\\
308 - Well, all right, Ethel, come along if
you want to.\\
309 - No, I don't want to; I just wanted
you to ask me.\\
310 - Oh, well...\\
311 - I'll see you later.
Okay.\\
312 - Good work.\\
313 - Okay.\\
314 - Madame, perhaps, would like another
cafe?\\
315 - Oh, no, thank you.
I've already had seven.\\
316 - Listen, are you sure you don't know
Maurice DuBois?\\
317 - I'm sorry, no.\\
318 - Funny, I felt sure he hung around
here all the time.\\
319 - There he is.\\
320 - Je vous demande pardon, madame.\\
321 - This is Monsieur Charles Boyer!\\
322 - Ha, ha. So he fooled you, too, huh?\\
323 - Well, good, that means he can fool my
husband.\\
324 - Here you are.\\
325 - Merci, madame.\\
326 - Merci.\\
327 - Monsieur DuBois?\\
328 - Monsieur DuBois?\\
329 - You are Monsieur DuBois, aren't you?\\
330 - Oh, oh, yes, I certainly am.\\
331 - Oh, it's nice to see you again.\\
332 - Well, it's very nice seeing you.\\
333 - I've been waiting for you for hours.\\
334 - For me?
Yes.\\
335 - I-I have something very important\\
336 - to talk to you about.\\
337 - Oh, I'm sorry, but I have a luncheon
engagement.\\
338 - This is very important.\\
339 - I have a job for you-- an acting job.\\
340 - Oh, really?\\
341 - Yes.\\
342 - Yes, it, uh...\\
343 - (clears throat)\\
344 - It's a romantic lead.\\
345 - Do you think you can handle it?\\
346 - Well, I don't know.\\
347 - I've never done anything like that
before.\\
348 - I see. Well, what kind of acting do
you do?\\
349 - Mostly Westerns.\\
350 - French Westerns?\\
351 - Yep.\\
352 - Well, do you think that you can do\\
353 - an imitation of Charles Boyer?\\
354 - (chuckling): Oh... Oh, I doubt it.\\
355 - Oh, he's so... so corny.\\
356 - Corny?\\
357 - My, you are bitter, aren't you?\\
358 - Well, and that voice of his.\\
359 - He always sounds like he has
indigestion.\\
360 - Don't worry about the voice.\\
361 - That, you can fake; I'll coach you.\\
362 - All right, I can try,\\
363 - but what's this all about, anyway?\\
364 - Well, my husband, Ricky, is insanely
jealous\\
365 - of Charles Boyer.\\
366 - No, he is?\\
367 - Yes. 'Course there's no sense to it.\\
368 - We've been happily married for 15
years.\\
369 - But I want to prove to Ricky\\
370 - that he has no reason to be jealous.\\
371 - And where do I come in?\\
372 - I want you to play a love scene with
me\\
373 - in front of Ricky.\\
374 - And when he sees I'm not a bit
impressed,\\
375 - he'll realize that he has nothing to
be jealous about.\\
376 - Will you do it?\\
377 - Well, you know, it's a tough
assignment.\\
378 - I'm a good actor, but I'm not sure
I'm that good.\\
379 - Well, we'll see.\\
380 - Now, I'll give you ten dollars.\\
381 - That's 3,500 francs!\\
382 - Hey, that's a lot of money.\\
383 - Yes, it is.\\
384 - Remember, if you do it well,\\
385 - you never can tell what might happen.\\
386 - I know a lot of pretty big people in
Hollywood.\\
387 - You do? Well, in that case, I can't
afford to turn you down.\\
388 - Good. Good. Now, can you get out of
this luncheon today?\\
389 - This-- oh, no, no, I'm afraid not.\\
390 - No? Well, all right, I'm at the Hotel
Royal.\\
391 - As soon as you have your little
luncheon,\\
392 - come up and I'll start coaching you.\\
393 - I'll be there as soon as I can.\\
394 - Fine. I'll see you later.\\
395 - Good-bye, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
396 - Good-bye.
Good-bye.\\
397 - Hello, Ricky.\\
398 - Hi, Charles.\\
399 - I've been just having a chat with
your wife.\\
400 - What?!\\
401 - Don't worry. She still thinks I'm
Maurice DuBois.\\
402 - Good, good.
And, by the way,\\
403 - she told me you are jealous of
Charles Boyer.\\
404 - (laughing uncontrollably)\\
405 - I put on a big act for her the other
day\\
406 - because I wanted to keep her away\\
407 - from this luncheon, you know.\\
408 - What did she want with you?\\
409 - Wait, wait until you hear the plot
she's cooked up.\\
410 - She wants me...\\
411 - Don't do it.\\
412 - But you haven't even heard what it
is.\\
413 - It doesn't matter, don't do it.\\
414 - Ricky, I think it might be a lot of
fun.\\
415 - She's hiring me to play the part of
Charles Boyer.\\
416 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
417 - You see, she is really quite
concerned\\
418 - about your jealousy, and she wants...\\
419 - All right, Maurice, now you know what
to do.\\
420 - Let's pretend that Ricky is seated
over there.\\
421 - Go ahead.\\
422 - Oh, no, no, Maurice.\\
423 - What's wrong?\\
424 - Charles Boyer doesn't kiss like that.\\
425 - When you kiss a woman's hand, put
some schmaltz into it.\\
426 - (smooching loudly)\\
427 - Silent schmaltz.\\
428 - Honestly, I don't know\\
429 - how you ever make a living as an
actor.\\
430 - I often wonder myself.\\
431 - Well, for one thing, don't just sit
there\\
432 - like a bump on a log.
Sit up, sit up.\\
433 - Try to look romantic, like Boyer.\\
434 - All right, and how does your Boyer
look romantic?\\
435 - Well...\\
436 - for one thing, he gets an expression
on his face\\
437 - like he just walked into the grand
ballroom\\
438 - and smelled cauliflower cooking.\\
439 - Oh, I see.\\
440 - Like that, huh?\\
441 - That's it.\\
442 - That's the look.\\
443 - That's good. Now, now tell me you
like me.\\
444 - Madame Ricardo, I like you very much.\\
445 - No, no, no.\\
446 - The voice, the voice.
Oh.\\
447 - When Boyer is being romantic,\\
448 - he doesn't just talk, he-he growls,
he says,\\
449 - (growling): "Ah, Lucy, I like you."\\
450 - Is that the way he sounds?\\
451 - Yes.\\
452 - Then I'm surprised he got as far as
he did.\\
453 - Just never mind.\\
454 - Now you try it.\\
455 - (growling)\\
456 - That's good!
No, no, no, no.\\
457 - I was just clearing my throat.\\
458 - Oh. Well, keep it in.
That's good, that's good.\\
459 - (growling)\\
460 - (with deep voice): Lucy, I like you.
You're so gor...\\
461 - No, keep the face up.
Keep the face up.\\
462 - Huh? What? Yes.
Remember, cauliflower cooking.\\
463 - (growling)\\
464 - Ah, Lucy, I like you.\\
465 - (growling)\\
466 - You're so gorgeous.\\
467 - Good, but don't strain your voice
now.\\
468 - You've got it, you've got it.\\
469 - You know, that's hard to do.\\
470 - Whew, that Boyer must have throat
muscles like a horse.\\
471 - Well, remember the plan now.\\
472 - You're to come by at 5:00\\
473 - and tell Ricky you were just passing\\
474 - and thought you'd drop in.\\
475 - Of course.\\
476 - Well, good-bye, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
477 - Good-bye.\\
478 - I'll see you at 5:00.\\
479 - Oh, uh, one more thing.\\
480 - Don't get too close to Ricky.
He'll know you're a phony.\\
481 - Oh, oh, I'll remember.\\
482 - Good-bye, Lucy.\\
483 - That's good.
That's good.\\
484 - (phone ringing)\\
485 - It's the phone, dear.\\
486 - Oh.\\
487 - Hello.\\
488 - Oh?\\
489 - Uh, yes, ask him to come up, please.\\
490 - Lucy, leave the room.\\
491 - Why, what's the matter?\\
492 - Somebody's coming up here that I
don't want you to meet,\\
493 - so leave the room go over to the
Mertzes'.\\
494 - Well, who is it? Who's coming up?
Tell me.\\
495 - All right, if you must know-- it's
him.\\
496 - Him?\\
497 - Charles Boyer, so leave the room. Go.\\
498 - That won't be necessary.\\
499 - Lucy!\\
500 - I am going to stay right here and
prove to you\\
501 - that Charles Boyer doesn't mean a
thing to me.\\
502 - (knock at door)\\
503 - Monsieur Ricardo.\\
504 - Oh, Mr. Boyer, will you please come
in?\\
505 - Mr. Boyer, I'd like you to meet my
wife, Lucy.\\
506 - Lucy, Charles Boyer.\\
507 - Well, I'm delighted to see you.\\
508 - Hi, there.\\
509 - Won't you sit down, please?\\
510 - Lucy, may I say that you are the most
fascinating,\\
511 - the most exciting creature I've ever
seen.\\
512 - Charles.\\
513 - (growling)\\
514 - Charles.\\
515 - (growling)\\
516 - Charles!\\
517 - Pardon me.\\
518 - Charles, would you mind telling me
what's going on here?\\
519 - I'm sorry, Ricky.\\
520 - I realize that you must think I'm a
cad,\\
521 - but when I walked into this room and
saw her,\\
522 - I took leave of my senses.\\
523 - I'm not responsible anymore.\\
524 - Ah, Lucy...\\
525 - Lucy, I... I know I could never have
your heart,\\
526 - but at least let me hold your hands.\\
527 - Oh, thank you, thank you.\\
528 - Lucy, how can you act so indifferent
to me\\
529 - when you must realize how I feel
about you?\\
530 - You want some orange?\\
531 - Oops!\\
532 - Want some orange, Ricky?\\
533 - No, thank you.\\
534 - Delicious.\\
535 - (phone rings)\\
536 - Hello.\\
537 - Lucy? Lucy, this is Ethel.\\
538 - Ricky is playing an awful dirty trick
on you.\\
539 - Fred just spilled the beans.\\
540 - What do you mean?\\
541 - That Maurice DuBois really is Charles
Boyer.\\
542 - (choking)\\
543 - Keep him there now.
I'm coming right up.\\
544 - Lucy, who was that on the phone?\\
545 - Nobody!\\
546 - Lucy, what was I saying before I was
interrupted?\\
547 - I don't know!\\
548 - Ah, don't run away from this.\\
549 - It was meant to be.\\
550 - Lucy, I am drawn to you like a moth
to a flame.\\
551 - I cannot help myself.\\
552 - (screams loudly)\\
553 - (laughing heartily)\\
554 - Charles, I think our little game is
over.\\
555 - That telephone call must have tipped
her off.\\
556 - I'm afraid so.\\
557 - Don't be silly. I knew who you were
all the time.\\
558 - Well, I hope you're not too angry
with us.\\
559 - No.\\
560 - Well, I must run along.\\
561 - I'm supposed to be interviewed on
television.\\
562 - Oh, that's right.
You told me.\\
563 - Well, thank you very much\\
564 - for being such a wonderful sport.\\
565 - Not at all; it was fun.\\
566 - Good-bye, Ricky.
Good-bye, Lucy.\\
567 - (growling)\\
568 - (Ricky laughing loudly)\\
569 - Ricky Ricardo, that's a dirty trick!\\
570 - What are you talking about?\\
571 - I thought you said\\
572 - you knew who he was all the time?\\
573 - Oh.\\
574 - Well, I did, but if I hadn't, that
was a dirty trick!\\
575 - So...\\
576 - So, you weren't even jealous or
anything.\\
577 - That was all a frame-up, huh?\\
578 - Right. I just wanted to keep you away
from him\\
579 - to avert the catastrophe.\\
580 - I don't trust you with celebrities.\\
581 - Well, you see, you were wrong.\\
582 - He was up here and what happened?\\
583 - Not a thing!
Well...\\
584 - Oh, oh, I saw him, I saw him!\\
585 - He was just getting off the elevator.
I was getting on.\\
586 - I'm goose bumps all over.\\
587 - What was he like?
What was he like?\\
588 - Oh, Ethel, he was just dreamy.\\
589 - He's so French and so...\\
590 - (growling)\\
591 - ETHEL: Oh, boy.\\
592 - He's just the living end.\\
593 - Oh, was he romantic like we thought?\\
594 - (knock at door)
I wanted to ask him\\
595 - for his autograph, but I just
couldn't do it.\\
596 - Hi, Charles.\\
597 - I'm sorry, Ricky, I forgot my hat.\\
598 - RICKY: Oh, come in.
Where is it?\\
599 - I think I...\\
600 - Excuse me.\\
601 - I think... I think I set it down on
the couch.\\
602 - Your hat?\\
603 - Yes.
You forgot your hat?\\
604 - Yes, I did.
Well.\\
605 - Oh, Mr. Boyer, I'm terribly sorry.\\
606 - I'm terribly sorry.\\
607 - That's perfectly all right.\\
608 - We'll have to get you a new hat.\\
609 - Oh, are you kidding?\\
610 - Mr. Boyer, while you're here could we
have your autograph?\\
611 - Why, certainly.\\
612 - Oh, yes, please.
I brought my book\\
613 - Now, Lucy!\\
614 - (clamoring)\\
615 - You'll have to write it twice now.\\
616 - I saw your picture...
I saw your picture\\
617 - about the Casbah,\\
618 - where you smoked two cigarettes and
everything.\\
619 - I afraid it's out of ink.\\
620 - No ink!\\
621 - Oh, I filled it this morning!\\
622 - Have you got a pen?\\
623 - I filled it this morning.\\
624 - Oh!\\
625 - RICKY: Lucy! Oh, no!\\
626 - Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Boyer.\\
627 - Milk... milk will take that out.\\
628 - All right, then, I'll get some. Thank
you.\\
629 - Look, you want to borrow one of my
shirts?\\
630 - Yeah, borrow one of Ricky's shirts.\\
631 - Oh, no, no.
No, that's all right.\\
632 - I'll keep my coat on.\\
633 - Oh, well, let me help you then.\\
634 - That's all right.\\
635 - Let me help you put your coat on.\\
636 - That's all right.\\
637 - Let me help him put his coat on!\\
638 - Please, now!\\
639 - I want to help him put his coat on!\\
640 - (coat ripping)\\
641 - RICKY: No!\\
642 - I'm sorry, Mr. Boyer.\\
643 - That's all right.\\
644 - We tore your coat.\\
645 - Oh, don't think about it.\\
646 - We'll mend it for you right now.\\
647 - No, no, no, please.\\
648 - Would you like for me to get my
sewing kit?\\
649 - No, that's all right.\\
650 - Just let me get out of here.\\
651 - No, no. No, no, that's fine.\\
652 - Charlie, I'm awfully sorry.\\
653 - (thud)
Oh, no!\\
654 - Mr. Boyer, I'm terribly sorry.\\
655 - Perfectly all right.\\
656 - It's all right. Never mind.\\
657 - Au revoir.\\
658 - No, no, no, no. Don't say au revoir,
dear.\\
659 - Just say good-bye.\\

\subsection {Episode 20: Lucy Gets a Paris Gown}
1 - (theme song ending)\\
2 - ANNOUNCER: And now, "I Love Lucy."\\
3 - (applause)\\
4 - (knock at door)\\
5 - Come in.\\
6 - Band manager Mertz reporting, sir.\\
7 - Hi, Fred.\\
8 - Hi.\\
9 - And here's your mail.\\
10 - Oh, thank you very much.\\
11 - You're welcome.\\
12 - Hey, this'll make Lucy happy.\\
13 - What is it?\\
14 - An invitation\\
15 - to the most famous spring fashion
show in Paris--\\
16 - Jacques Marcel's.\\
17 - Jacques Marcel, the big dress
designer?\\
18 - Yeah. Oh, this was hard to get.\\
19 - I had to pull a few strings.\\
20 - I'd like to pull a string around your
neck.\\
21 - Why? What's the matter?\\
22 - What do you let me in for?\\
23 - Do you know what that guy charges for
his clothes?\\
24 - Oh-ho-ho, Fred, they just want to go
there\\
25 - so they can say that they've been
there.\\
26 - They don't want to buy anything; they
want to look.\\
27 - "Look"? turning our wives loose in
that place\\
28 - is like taking two mice on a tour\\
29 - through a cheese factory.\\
30 - No, Fred, I-I don't think...\\
31 - Oh, now, listen.\\
32 - I met a guy yesterday from St.
Petersburg, Florida,\\
33 - down at the American Express office.\\
34 - Yeah?\\
35 - His wife went to one of those
showings.\\
36 - He ended up shelling out 500 clams
for one dress!\\
37 - 500?!\\
38 - That's just the start.\\
39 - Where they finish, nobody knows.\\
40 - Well, well...\\
41 - Well?\\
42 - I do want to make Lucy happy.\\
43 - Well?\\
44 - And if she goes to this place,\\
45 - and she's not able to buy a dress,\\
46 - Yeah?\\
47 - ...she will feel miserable.\\
48 - Uh-huh.\\
49 - So, if I don't show her this
invitation,\\
50 - I will actually be sparing her all of
that misery.\\
51 - Uh-huh.\\
52 - I'll be doing her a favor.\\
53 - You know, it's wonderful\\
54 - the way you're always thinking of
Lucy.\\
55 - Thank you.\\
56 - Welcome back to the Husbands Union.\\
57 - Thank you, Fred.\\
58 - I lost my head there for a minute,
old man.\\
59 - Yes, you did.\\
60 - (Lucy and Ethel chattering)\\
61 - Cheese it, the mice.\\
62 - RICKY AND FRED: Hi, girls.\\
63 - Hi, fellas.\\
64 - Well, where have you been all day?\\
65 - Shopping on the Champs-Elysees.\\
66 - RICKY: Well, isn't that nice?\\
67 - Fred, look at the bag I bought.\\
68 - It only cost a thousand francs.\\
69 - A thousand francs?!\\
70 - Relax. That's $2.85.\\
71 - Oh, I keep forgetting.\\
72 - Honey, what did you buy?\\
73 - Oh, a toy for Little Ricky\\
74 - and perfume for Mrs. Trumbull.\\
75 - That bottle must be leaking.
I smell perfume.\\
76 - Oh, no, dear, that's on me.\\
77 - The sales lady says that after one
good whiff of this perfume,\\
78 - you'd burst into flame.\\
79 - Take a whiff.\\
80 - Pow-wow!\\
81 - Mmm-mm.\\
82 - Uh, I'm wearing some of that\\
83 - potent perfume, too, Freddie.\\
84 - (sniffing)\\
85 - Well?\\
86 - Nice try.\\
87 - Oh, I could have done better\\
88 - with a book of wet matches.\\
89 - Oh, darn it, it isn't here.\\
90 - It should have been here by now.\\
91 - Wh-What's that, dear?\\
92 - Our invitation to Jacques Marcel's
fashion show.\\
93 - Oh, oh, the invitation.\\
94 - Yeah, well, uh, you know, I forgot to
tell you\\
95 - I tried to get one, but they're very
hard to get.\\
96 - Only the, um... you know,\\
97 - the fashion designers and the buyers,\\
98 - that's all that get them.\\
99 - Oh, darn it!\\
100 - Oh, I really wanted to go to that.\\
101 - (phone rings)\\
102 - That's probably our last chance to
see a big show, too.\\
103 - Maybe some other time.\\
104 - Hello.\\
105 - Yes, this is Mrs. Ricardo.\\
106 - Oh?\\
107 - Jacques Marcel's secretary?\\
108 - Yes.\\
109 - Oh, no, we didn't.\\
110 - Well, of course, we'll be there.\\
111 - Tomorrow at 2:00.\\
112 - Thank you. Good-bye.\\
113 - We're invited to the fashion show.\\
114 - Gee, I wonder why we didn't get our
invitation.\\
115 - I have a feeling we did.\\
116 - Ricky, where is the invitation?\\
117 - The...
the invitation?\\
118 - The invitation to the fashion show,
where is it?\\
119 - Honey, I don't...\\
120 - By George, it did come in the mail!\\
121 - How do you like that?\\
122 - You lied to me.\\
123 - You said this didn't come.\\
124 - No, I did not.\\
125 - I said they were hard to get.\\
126 - It's my own fault.\\
127 - He's beginning to think like me.\\
128 - Promise me, you're only going there
to look.\\
129 - I'm disappointed in you.\\
130 - You don't trust me.
I told you,\\
131 - I was only going to go there to look.\\
132 - Ethel, need I say that the same goes
for you?\\
133 - You need not, Diamond Jim Mertz.\\
134 - What are you going to wear, honey?\\
135 - My brown jacket.\\
136 - I think I'll wear my gray. The one...\\
137 - ETHEL: Oh!\\
138 - LUCY: Did you ever see such clothes
in your life?\\
139 - Oh, Lucy, weren't they dreamy?\\
140 - That blue satin suit\\
141 - was the most beautiful thing I've
ever seen.\\
142 - Wouldn't I like to have something
like that just once.\\
143 - How about that wedding dress...\\
144 - Bonjour, madame.\\
145 - Entrez, s'il vous plait.\\
146 - Oh, thank you.
Merci.\\
147 - Oh, merci.\\
148 - That's hand-embroidery on that
wedding dress.\\
149 - Oh, wasn't that beautiful?\\
150 - Thousands and thousands of little...\\
151 - There'll be four or us.\\
152 - Oh, my, what dresses!
What dresses!\\
153 - Gee, I can hardly wait for the fellas
to get here.\\
154 - (sighing): What are you gonna have?\\
155 - A Jacques Marcel dress.\\
156 - Oh, Lucy.\\
157 - I've just got to have one.\\
158 - I'm going to get one if it's the last
thing I do.\\
159 - Well, it will be.\\
160 - (sighing)\\
161 - Oh, here come the fellas.\\
162 - LUCY: Hi.\\
163 - ETHEL: Hi there.\\
164 - RICKY: Did you have a good time?\\
165 - Yeah, wonderful.\\
166 - Ricky, it was the most beautiful
thing.\\
167 - Just magnificent clothes.\\
168 - The most gorgeous clothes\\
169 - I've ever seen in my whole life.\\
170 - Well, I'm glad you went and got a
good look\\
171 - and got it out of your system.\\
172 - Ricky?\\
173 - No.\\
174 - No what?\\
175 - I'm not gonna buy you a Jacques
Marcel dress.\\
176 - That is not what I was going to ask.\\
177 - Honey, I know you pretty well.\\
178 - You know me well enough to know\\
179 - that I'm gonna pester you for that
dress\\
180 - till the end of my days?\\
181 - And do you know me well enough to
know\\
182 - that if you do, the end might come
sooner than you expect?\\
183 - You never buy me anything.\\
184 - What do you mean I never buy you
anything?\\
185 - How about that Don Lauper original\\
186 - I bought you in Hollywood?\\
187 - That Don Lauper original.\\
188 - That old thing?\\
189 - When I bought you that dress,\\
190 - you promised me that you will never
ask me\\
191 - for another expensive dress as long
as you live.\\
192 - Oh, I couldn't have said a thing like
that.\\
193 - You must be thinking of one of your
other wives.\\
194 - Ethel, I'll leave it up to you.\\
195 - Did that sound like something I'd
say?\\
196 - I pass.\\
197 - You see... What do you mean, you
pass?\\
198 - I'd like to read something to you.\\
199 - (sighs)\\
200 - "February 28, 1955.\\
201 - "If Ricky buys me a Don Lauper
original,\\
202 - "I will never ask him for another
expensive dress\\
203 - "as long as I live.\\
204 - Signed, Lucy Ricardo."\\
205 - Let me see that.\\
206 - Obviously, a forgery.\\
207 - It won't help you; I had it
photostated.\\
208 - Oh...\\
209 - Now, honey, why don't you be a good
girl?\\
210 - You don't hear Ethel\\
211 - asking Fred to buy her a new dress.\\
212 - I'll be lucky if he buys me my lunch.\\
213 - (Ethel shrieks)\\
214 - Look, Lucy, there's one of the models
from the show.\\
215 - LUCY: Oh, yes.\\
216 - ETHEL: Oh!\\
217 - What was that?\\
218 - That's one of the outfits she wore in
the show.\\
219 - She's too late for Halloween.\\
220 - Yeah, and she's too early for April
Fool.\\
221 - Oh, Fred, honestly.\\
222 - Now, that was really a beautiful
outfit.\\
223 - You just...
(shrieks)\\
224 - ETHEL: Here comes another one.\\
225 - Oh, isn't that hat really something?\\
226 - Oh...\\
227 - Did you ever see anything like that
in your life?\\
228 - It was absolutely out of this world.\\
229 - That explains it-- they're from Mars.\\
230 - Oh, Fred, honestly.\\
231 - You just don't appreciate high
fashion.\\
232 - High fashion?\\
233 - That looks like it was made out of a
potato sack.\\
234 - ETHEL: Oh, Ricky.\\
235 - Just ignore them.
Just ignore them.\\
236 - (Ethel shrieks)\\
237 - LUCY: Oh, this is the one I like.\\
238 - I really love this one.\\
239 - Ethel, did you leave our hotel room
unlocked?\\
240 - No. Why?\\
241 - She's got on my old flannel bathrobe.\\
242 - Oh, Fred, honestly.\\
243 - You two make me sick.\\
244 - You just make me ill, that's all.\\
245 - Oh, forget about the fashion show.\\
246 - Let's have some lunch.
Yeah.\\
247 - What do you want?\\
248 - Nothing.\\
249 - What do you mean, nothing?\\
250 - I am going on a hunger strike.\\
251 - Oh, no.\\
252 - Until you buy me a Jacques Marcel
dress,\\
253 - no food will pass my lips.\\
254 - Oh, Lucy, don't you think that's
carrying...\\
255 - If that's what she wants to do, it's
all right with me.\\
256 - Yeah, that hungers strike's a good
idea.\\
257 - Ethel, why don't you...?\\
258 - Oh, shut up.\\
259 - It won't last very long anyway.\\
260 - You just wait and see.\\
261 - Until you put a Jacques Marcel dress
on my back,\\
262 - I will put not a bite in my stomach.\\
263 - Okay.\\
264 - Okay.\\
265 - Okay.\\
266 - Okay.\\
267 - Okay.\\
268 - Okay!\\
269 - Here we are, Rick.
What did you want?\\
270 - Oh, listen, I got a plan.\\
271 - I think I know how to break Lucy's
hunger strike.\\
272 - Oh, good. What are you gonna do?\\
273 - Well, I ordered some lunch sent up
here, see,\\
274 - and we'll all gonna eat it right in
front of her.\\
275 - Oh, that's a wonderful idea.\\
276 - What did you order?\\
277 - Ethel, we just ate.
How can you eat again?\\
278 - There is no sacrifice I wouldn't make
for my friend Lucy.\\
279 - What did you order?\\
280 - Well, all kinds of tasty-looking
stuff, you know.\\
281 - I'll bet this will weaken her.\\
282 - You know, she's been on this strike
for three whole days.\\
283 - I don't know how she can stand it.\\
284 - Maybe she's sneaking food in on you.\\
285 - No, no, no. The clerk told me that
she hasn't left the room\\
286 - or had anything sent up.\\
287 - Holy cats!\\
288 - If this doesn't work, I don't know
what else I can do.\\
289 - I do.\\
290 - No.\\
291 - I'm not going to buy her a Jacques
Marcel dress.\\
292 - By now, it's the principle of the
thing.\\
293 - And $500 is a lot of principle.\\
294 - Now, will you help me?\\
295 - Sure.
Okay.\\
296 - Lucy!\\
297 - Come out here, honey.\\
298 - The Mertzes are here.\\
299 - Come on, sweetheart.\\
300 - Honey, I ordered some lunch for all
of us.\\
301 - Not for me.\\
302 - I'm staying on my hunger strike.\\
303 - Ethel: Oh...\\
304 - Now, honey, you got to eat something.\\
305 - You can't go on like this.\\
306 - No, no, I'm fine.\\
307 - Oh, Lucy, no dress is worth all of
this.\\
308 - Don't worry about me.\\
309 - Somehow, food doesn't mean a thing to
me anymore.\\
310 - Oh, food!
ETHEL: Oh, honey...\\
311 - (knock at door)\\
312 - Here's the lunch.\\
313 - Come on, everybody, let's eat.\\
314 - Sit down, Ethel.\\
315 - Okay.\\
316 - I had a beautiful lunch sent up.\\
317 - Oh, fine.
Come right in.\\
318 - Look at that.\\
319 - Oh, Ricky!\\
320 - RICKY: Isn't that gorgeous?\\
321 - ETHEL: Isn't that wonderful?\\
322 - Oh!\\
323 - Oh, boy, look at that food.\\
324 - Everybody, dig right in there!\\
325 - RICKY: Dig right in.\\
326 - Huh?\\
327 - ALL: Mmm!\\
328 - ETHEL: Mmm, boy!\\
329 - Mmm, delicious.\\
330 - Mmm-mm. Boy, that's good.\\
331 - RICKY: Mm, huh, huh, huh?\\
332 - Honey, look. Mmm.\\
333 - Steak...\\
334 - french-fried potatoes...\\
335 - broccoli and hollandaise sauce.\\
336 - Isn't that gorgeous, hmm?\\
337 - Look at this, honey... bread.\\
338 - And look at that butter--\\
339 - lots of butter with the bread.\\
340 - Isn't that nice?\\
341 - Look, baby.\\
342 - Look at this wonderful shrimp salad.\\
343 - You ever seen anything so beautiful
in your life?\\
344 - Hmm? Huh?\\
345 - Look, look, honey, look.\\
346 - Look at the French pastry.\\
347 - Huh? Isn't that gorgeous?\\
348 - Isn't that pretty, huh?\\
349 - Doesn't it all taste and smell good?\\
350 - FRED: Come on, Lucy, sit down and dig
into this.\\
351 - Come on, baby. Here.\\
352 - Look, look, nice piece of meat.\\
353 - Look at that.\\
354 - No! No!\\
355 - Now, honey, you got to eat something.\\
356 - No.\\
357 - If you don't, I'll force it.\\
358 - You can't force me.\\
359 - We'll wait and see. Hmm.\\
360 - Make a nice sandwich.\\
361 - Look at this beautiful sandwich,
here. Here.\\
362 - No.\\
363 - Lucy.\\
364 - (muffled grunt)\\
365 - Lucy!
(muffled grunts)\\
366 - Open your mouth.
(muffled grunt)\\
367 - Open your mouth!\\
368 - I'll make you open your mouth.\\
369 - You gotta breathe some time.\\
370 - You gotta open your mouth.\\
371 - You're going to 'splode.\\
372 - Open your mouth.\\
373 - Come on, come on.\\
374 - Lucy.\\
375 - There.\\
376 - Lucy.\\
377 - Well, I don't know what else I can
do.\\
378 - You can buy me that dress.\\
379 - I will not!\\
380 - All right, then, I'll starve.\\
381 - Okay, then starve!\\
382 - Come on, Fred, I got a rehearsal.\\
383 - Okay.\\
384 - The coast is clear.\\
385 - Good! I thought they'd never leave.\\
386 - Oh, so that's where you've been
keeping it. Ha-ha!\\
387 - Aah-dee-dah\\
388 - 23... bologna\\
389 - And 85... Jacques cheese.\\
390 - Dee-dee-dee-dah.\\
391 - Say, Ethel, we're getting a little
low on lettuce.\\
392 - You'd better put it down on your
shopping list.\\
393 - Okay.\\
394 - Let's see now, uh... mustard.\\
395 - Mustard?\\
396 - Mustard, mustard\\
397 - Have to have mustard on a sandwich
like this.\\
398 - Doo-whoo-doo-doo.\\
399 - Ha-ha!\\
400 - Oh, boy. Hurry up, take a bite.\\
401 - (chomping noisily)\\
402 - Good, huh?
Mmm, wonderful.\\
403 - Oh, Lucy, that was a regular
Academy-Award performance\\
404 - you gave in front of Ricky and Fred.\\
405 - You even had me believing you were
starving.\\
406 - Thank you.\\
407 - Now then, what do you want me\\
408 - to bring you for dinner tonight?\\
409 - Oh, I don't know, I'm kind of sick of
sandwiches.\\
410 - I'll bet. How about a nice roast
chicken?\\
411 - Hey, that sounds good.\\
412 - All righty.
I'll see you later.\\
413 - Okay.\\
414 - Anything else?\\
415 - No. I got to cut down.\\
416 - If I stay on this hunger strike much
longer,\\
417 - I'll be as fat as a pig.\\
418 - Are you ready for your dinner?\\
419 - Yes, ma'am.\\
420 - I got you a nice roast chicken.\\
421 - Oh, wonderful.\\
422 - I would've gotten you a great big
one,\\
423 - but it wouldn't fit in my camera bag.\\
424 - Oh, Ethel, oh, this is a beauty!\\
425 - RICKY: Come on in, Fred.\\
426 - Oh, Lucy, oh! Oh!\\
427 - I don't know what's gonna happen to
you\\
428 - if you don't eat... Hi.\\
429 - Hi.\\
430 - Honey...\\
431 - (weak grunt)\\
432 - You win.\\
433 - I couldn't stand to see you suffer
anymore,\\
434 - so I bought you a Jacques Marcel
dress.\\
435 - Oh, honey, how...\\
436 - Oh, darling...\\
437 - you've made me the happiest starving
woman in France.\\
438 - Well, honey,\\
439 - I think it's a great tribute to your
willpower.\\
440 - Oh, thank you.\\
441 - Here, you're too weak.
I'll help you out.\\
442 - Oh, no, that's all right.
I'll open it.\\
443 - I feel my strength coming back
already.\\
444 - I can hardly wait to try it on.\\
445 - Well, listen, let's go and eat
something\\
446 - and then you can try it on.\\
447 - Oh, no, I want to try it on first and
then we'll eat.\\
448 - You do, you want to try it on first?\\
449 - Yeah.
Well, all right.\\
450 - Try it on. Oh, I'll take a picture of
you.\\
451 - Oh, no! I'll, I'll...\\
452 - On second thought, let's go eat.\\
453 - Before I try it on, we'll go...\\
454 - What kind of a camera is this?\\
455 - It's a... It's a-a...\\
456 - Well...\\
457 - It looks like a roast chicken.\\
458 - It's a 3D picture of a roast chicken.\\
459 - See, the depth...\\
460 - Looks almost real, doesn't it?\\
461 - Lucy...
Hmm?\\
462 - you've been sneaking food in here all
this time!\\
463 - FRED: Yeah.\\
464 - And I know who was mother's little
big fat helper.\\
465 - Oh...\\
466 - Okay, that dress is going right back.\\
467 - Oh, no, it is not!\\
468 - Yes, it is!\\
469 - Throw it, Lucy!\\
470 - I got it!\\
471 - Oh, no, catch it!\\
472 - Ethel!\\
473 - I got it!\\
474 - Oh! I got it! I got it!\\
475 - Oh, no! Oh!\\
476 - Open up, Fred!\\
477 - No!\\
478 - You... you Indian giver!\\
479 - Oh, you!\\
480 - Oh, that was real nice of Marcel, you
know.\\
481 - He didn't really have to give me my
money back.\\
482 - Well, listen, at those prices,\\
483 - I could afford to be a good egg, too.\\
484 - Yeah, but usually you buy something\\
485 - and then you're stuck.\\
486 - Yeah, I guess you're right.\\
487 - MAITRE D': Bonjour, monsieur.\\
488 - Comment ca va ?
Fine. Comment ca va?\\
489 - Two coffees, please.\\
490 - Two coffees.\\
491 - Well, I can't get over that Lucy.\\
492 - I'd sure like to get even with her.\\
493 - Well, you just did.\\
494 - That's not enough.\\
495 - Oh, come, come, come now, come.\\
496 - Don't be bitter.\\
497 - Now, that one had to be made out of a
potato sack.\\
498 - Yeah, and some of the potatoes are
still in it.\\
499 - Hey, you know, Fred, that gives me an
idea.\\
500 - Oh, what is it?
What do you mean?\\
501 - I think I know a way how to get even
with Lucy,\\
502 - and at the same time show her how
silly\\
503 - this high fashion stuff is.\\
504 - Well, let's hear it.\\
505 - You know that-that little tailor
across the hotel?\\
506 - You mean where we had the band
uniforms cleaned?\\
507 - Right.
Yeah.\\
508 - Now, suppose I make a deal with this
guy\\
509 - to make me a...
a completely crazy dress\\
510 - out of a real potato sack\\
511 - and then I get a Jacques Marcel label
and put it on it.\\
512 - You think that Lucy would...?\\
513 - Of course she would.\\
514 - Only make it two potato sacks.\\
515 - For a couple of extra bucks,\\
516 - I'd like to have Ethel well-dressed,
too.\\
517 - Oh, wait a minute, we need hats.\\
518 - Hats.\\
519 - Yeah. What about hats?\\
520 - What can we do with that?\\
521 - Hey, wait a minute.\\
522 - Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, will you?\\
523 - (with falsetto): How do I look?\\
524 - Simply stunning.\\
525 - Thank you.\\
526 - There's another one down there right
like it.\\
527 - Fred, please.\\
528 - Lucy wouldn't be caught dead wearing
the same bucket.\\
529 - Well, I should have known. Yeah.\\
530 - Hey, look.\\
531 - Where?\\
532 - That would make a wonderful hat.\\
533 - Right across the street.\\
534 - All I see over there is a horse.\\
535 - That's right.\\
536 - If he doesn't mind giving up his feed
bag.\\
537 - Oh, honey, so you have to go home\\
538 - without a Jacques Marcel dress.\\
539 - You've been moping about it for two
days.\\
540 - I haven't even started to mope.\\
541 - I intend to mope all the way across
Europe.\\
542 - I will be the mopiest, mopiest...\\
543 - What's that?\\
544 - Well, honey...\\
545 - the other day when you called me an
Indian giver,\\
546 - it got me right here.\\
547 - So, I bought you a whole new outfit.\\
548 - Oh, honey!\\
549 - And here, Ethel, I'm no piker.\\
550 - Here's an outfit for you, too.\\
551 - For me?
Yeah.\\
552 - From Jacques Marcel!\\
553 - Fred, are you all right?\\
554 - I'm fine.
Are you getting a fever?\\
555 - No-no fever.\\
556 - Oh, Fred!\\
557 - Oh, my, I'm so glad you went on a
hunger....\\
558 - Oh, Fred, I can't...
Oh, I can't...\\
559 - Oh, isn't it... lovely?\\
560 - I didn't see anything like this in
the show.\\
561 - I didn't either.\\
562 - Of course not.\\
563 - These are later than the show.\\
564 - These are next year's fashions.\\
565 - Well, you're the only two women in
the world\\
566 - who have these.\\
567 - LUCY: No kidding?
We are?\\
568 - RICKY: That's right, yeah.
Oh, boy!\\
569 - Gee, that's unusual fabric.\\
570 - Well, leave it to Jacques.\\
571 - What an inspired use of burlap.\\
572 - Isn't that clever of him?\\
573 - Yeah.\\
574 - Oh, come on, Ethel, let's try them
on.\\
575 - Don't forget your hat.\\
576 - Hat?! Hat?!\\
577 - Are they originals?\\
578 - Of course they are.\\
579 - I'll meet you back here.\\
580 - We'll take you for a walk afterwards.\\
581 - Oh, thank you, Frederick.\\
582 - You're welcome.\\
583 - How do I look?\\
584 - Ethel, you never looked better in
your life.\\
585 - My, we're certainly attracting
attention.\\
586 - Do you think maybe these outfits are
a little too extreme?\\
587 - No, honey.\\
588 - On you, it looks great.
Okay.\\
589 - I never wore burlap before.\\
590 - Honeybunch, you were made for it.\\
591 - Oh, thank you, Fred.\\
592 - Oh, Ethel, look, there's Jacques
Marcel.\\
593 - He's staring at us.\\
594 - Yes.\\
595 - LUCY: I hope he thinks\\
596 - we're doing the clothes justice.\\
597 - (laughing)\\
598 - Oh, that hat on you.\\
599 - You like it?\\
600 - Yes.\\
601 - Oh, they really look lovely, don't
they?\\
602 - You know, I think I'll go after him\\
603 - and thank him for letting us scoop
the fashion world.\\
604 - I think we should.
Well, duh, duh, duh,\\
605 - I wouldn't do that if I were you.\\
606 - Why not? I think it's a very nice
gesture.\\
607 - Oh, I think we should.\\
608 - Yeah, I know, but...\\
609 - We'll just say thank you\\
610 - for letting us be a few months ahead.
I love the...\\
611 - I wouldn't do it if I were you.\\
612 - (Fred and Ricky laughing)\\
613 - What are you laughing at?\\
614 - (laughing harder)\\
615 - What are you laughing at?\\
616 - I don't see anything funny.\\
617 - Oh, you fell for this\\
618 - just like I fell for that hunger
strike.\\
619 - (taunting laugh)\\
620 - What? What?!\\
621 - I had a little tailor made those
dresses\\
622 - out of real potato sacks.\\
623 - You mean, you mean, you mean, Jacques
Marcel didn't make this?\\
624 - No, a little tailor made the potato
sacks.\\
625 - Jacques Marcel didn't make these.\\
626 - You think that's funny?\\
627 - We have to leave. We have to go. I
don't think I\\
628 - I borrowed that from a horse-- the
feed bag.\\
629 - Oh.\\
630 - RICKY: That's a big bucket.\\
631 - Honestly.\\
632 - They look lovely.\\
633 - I think you look very cute.\\
634 - (both grumbling)\\
635 - I don't think that's very funny.\\
636 - (laughing)\\
637 - I see. Not till after 2:00.\\
638 - All right, thank you very much.\\
639 - They're having a private showing.\\
640 - Nobody can get in there till after
2:00.\\
641 - Well, don't you think you're getting
away with a thing.\\
642 - We're going to the restaurant next
door,\\
643 - and on the stroke of 2:00,\\
644 - you are going up to Jacques Marcel's\\
645 - and buy me the dress I want no matter
what it costs.\\
646 - All right, all right.
All right.\\
647 - And don't try to get out of your
bargain.\\
648 - I won't.\\
649 - And Ricky, you got to pay\\
650 - for half of Ethel's dress for getting
me into this.\\
651 - I told you we shouldn't have taken
these girls over there...\\
652 - All right already!
I said I'd do it. Come on\\
653 - I wish I never heard of Jacques
Marcel.\\
654 - Well, it serves you right for
humiliating us\\
655 - that way in a public place.\\
656 - I never heard of anybody\\
657 - doing anything quite like that in my
life.\\
658 - Come on, let's go.\\
659 - Sometimes I wish I never left Cuba.\\
660 - FRED: Yeah.\\
661 - Trente mille francs.\\
662 - Oh, that was good coffee, wasn't it?\\
663 - Yeah.\\
664 - Lucy, look.
What?\\
665 - There's Jacques Marcel and his
models.\\
666 - Well, I'll be.\\
667 - How do you like that?\\
668 - That crook stole our stuff.\\
669 - Well, girls, now we don't have to buy
you any dresses.\\
670 - You have the originals.\\
671 - (chortling)\\
672 - What's the matter?\\
673 - We burned them.\\
674 - Oh, no!\\
675 - (orchestra playing closing flourish)\\
676 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
677 - ANNOUNCER: The waiter was John
Bleifer.\\
678 - "I Love Lucy" is a Desilu Production.\\
679 - Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz\\
680 - will be back next week at this same
time.
\subsection {Episode 21: Lucy in the Swiss Alps}
1 - "Lucy in the Swiss Alps"\\
2 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
3 - (theme song ending)\\
4 - ANNOUNCER: And now, "I Love Lucy."\\
5 - (applause)\\
6 - Hi.			Hi.\\
7 - Oh, Ethel,\\
8 - isn't that the greatest sight you've
ever seen?\\
9 - Imagine having an Alp right outside
your window.\\
10 - Oh, Lucy, it's all so beautiful,\\
11 - it leaves me absolutely speechless.\\
12 - Yeah. Why did you have to louse it
up, Lucy?\\
13 - That's the first time she's stopped
talking\\
14 - since we've been married.\\
15 - Oh, Fred, you haven't even looked out
the window.\\
16 - Haven't you any appreciation for
beauty?\\
17 - What are you doing, Ethel, fishing
for insults?\\
18 - Oh, Fred, now come on.
Isn't Switzerland\\
19 - the most breathtaking country you've
ever been in?\\
20 - Well, I'll admit, the scenery around
Steubenville, Ohio,\\
21 - is not as pretty as it is here in
Locarno.\\
22 - Locarno?\\
23 - Yeah.\\
24 - (laughing): You don't even know where
you are.\\
25 - This is Lucerne.\\
26 - Ethel, we're in Locarno.\\
27 - No, Fred, we're in Lucerne.\\
28 - Now, don't tell me.\\
29 - After Paris, Ricky and the band were
booked into Locarno.\\
30 - It's right here on the schedule.\\
31 - What does that say?\\
32 - Lucerne.\\
33 - Now, put your glasses on.\\
34 - You know you can't read without them.\\
35 - And you're the one that sat on my
glasses in Paris.\\
36 - Lucy, does this really say "Lucerne?"\\
37 - Yes, Fred.\\
38 - Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh!\\
39 - What's the matter?
We're in Lucerne.\\
40 - Yeah, we're in Lucerne,\\
41 - but I sent the whole band to Locarno.\\
42 - Yes, I read that schedule without my
glasses on!\\
43 - Oh, Lucy, what are you gonna do with
him?\\
44 - If you sent the band to Locarno,\\
45 - why did you buy us tickets for
Lucerne?\\
46 - I didn't. Ricky bought our tickets.\\
47 - I had a headache and...\\
48 - Oh, I'm getting out of here.\\
49 - Why?\\
50 - I'm not gonna hang around here\\
51 - and explain this to Ricky.\\
52 - Oh, for heaven's...\\
53 - He'll punch me right in the nose.\\
54 - Oh, he will not punch you in the
nose.\\
55 - Now, listen, all the times Ricky's
been mad at me,\\
56 - he never once struck me.\\
57 - Well, you're bigger than I am.\\
58 - Oh, Fred.\\
59 - Don't let that Latin temperament
scare you.\\
60 - Rick's bark is worse than his bite.\\
61 - Don't tell me he bites, too.\\
62 - Now, Fred, you've got to tell him
sometime.\\
63 - Well, I'll tell him all right, in a
year or two.\\
64 - No, sir, you're gonna go right in
there and tell him now.\\
65 - Wait a minute.\\
66 - Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Ethel.\\
67 - We'll help you, Fred.\\
68 - We'll go in there and we'll get Ricky\\
69 - in a gay, happy, carefree mood.\\
70 - And when he's sort of off his guard,\\
71 - we will laughingly let the bad news
sneak in, huh?\\
72 - Well... all right.\\
73 - But what a way to go.\\
74 - Come on, now, laugh it up.\\
75 - Laugh it up now.\\
76 - Gay, carefree, you know.\\
77 - (laughter)\\
78 - Hi!\\
79 - Hi.\\
80 - (laughing)\\
81 - Hey, what's with you?
You're in good humor, huh?\\
82 - Yeah, we're all so happy to be here
in Lucerne.\\
83 - Isn't the scenery beautiful?\\
84 - Isn't the weather gay and carefree?\\
85 - Yeah, yeah, Lucerne is certainly\\
86 - everything everybody said it was
gonna be.\\
87 - Yeah. It just makes you want to laugh
out loud, doesn't it?\\
88 - I guess it kind of does, yeah.\\
89 - LUCY: Yeah!\\
90 - (all laughing)\\
91 - Just think, the four of us,\\
92 - all together here in Lucerne.\\
93 - (laughing)
Yeah.\\
94 - Just the four of us.\\
95 - By the way, the band is in Locarno.\\
96 - (laughing heartily)\\
97 - Yes, sir.\\
98 - Fred sent them there by mistake.\\
99 - (laughing harder)\\
100 - The... the band is in Locarno?\\
101 - Yeah!\\
102 - (laughing uncontrollably)\\
103 - You're fired!\\
104 - (Ricky laughing hysterically)\\
105 - Fired?\\
106 - Yeah, fired.\\
107 - What kind of a band manager are you
anyway?\\
108 - You can't fire Fred\\
109 - right here in the middle of the Swiss
Alps.\\
110 - Oh, I can't, huh?\\
111 - What are you gonna do,\\
112 - get a Saint Bernard to manage the
band?\\
113 - He could do better than Fred.\\
114 - (phone dialing)\\
115 - The band is in Locarno.\\
116 - Mira, que tiene cosa... Hello?\\
117 - I want some information, please.\\
118 - Have you got a train from Locarno to
Lucerne?\\
119 - All right.
How long does it take?\\
120 - Four hours?\\
121 - I want to send a wire right away.\\
122 - To the Ricky Ricardo Band.\\
123 - Where are they?\\
124 - I told them to meet us\\
125 - at the American Express office.\\
126 - That was clever.\\
127 - Hello? At the American Express office
in Locarno, that's right.\\
128 - Here's the message: "Mistake in
booking.\\
129 - "Take the next train to Lucerne.\\
130 - Signed, Ricky."\\
131 - Right. Thank you very much.\\
132 - There, now, you see how simple it is?\\
133 - Everything's gonna be all right, huh?\\
134 - All right, you're not fired, but that
band better get here.\\
135 - For heaven's sake, Ricky,\\
136 - you can't stay in this room all day
worrying.\\
137 - I can't help it. I'm nervous.\\
138 - If the band doesn't get here, I have
to cancel the show.\\
139 - Well, at least stop pacing.\\
140 - When I'm nervous, I pace.\\
141 - Well, do your pacing outside.\\
142 - Let's go climb a mountain or
something.\\
143 - I'm not in a climbing mountain mood.\\
144 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
145 - (knock at door)
Come in.\\
146 - Rick, our troubles are over.\\
147 - What happened? What do you mean?\\
148 - In case the band doesn't get here on
time,\\
149 - Yeah?\\
150 - I lined up a local outfit\\
151 - that'll play with you tonight.\\
152 - They're right outside.\\
153 - A local outfit?
Yeah.\\
154 - Are you kidding? How can a Swiss band
play Latin rumbas?\\
155 - Well, they've been practicing for an
hour.\\
156 - Oh, Fred...\\
157 - Oh, come on, honey, at least you can
listen.\\
158 - Please, try it, Rick.
They're musicians\\
159 - and music is the universal language.\\
160 - They can play anything.\\
161 - Well, all right, all right.\\
162 - Oh, goody, goody.\\
163 - Hey! Come on in, fellas!\\
164 - Come on.\\
165 - Hello.\\
166 - Guten tag, guten tag.\\
167 - Guten tag.\\
168 - Okay.\\
169 - All right, fellas, "La Cucaracha."\\
170 - Give them the beat, Rick.\\
171 - One, two...\\
172 - Try eins, zwei.\\
173 - Eins, zwei?\\
174 - Ja.\\
175 - Eins, zwei.\\
176 - (playing oom-pah version of "La
Cucaracha")\\
177 - (song ends)\\
178 - That is not "La Cucaracha."\\
179 - No?\\
180 - No.\\
181 - Das is not "La Cucaracha."\\
182 - Es ist nicht "La Cucaracha"?\\
183 - Nein, das sounds more like der
"Schnitzelbank."\\
184 - A "Schnitzelbank."\\
185 - Gewiss!\\
186 - (band playing "Schnitzelbank")\\
187 - What are you doing?\\
188 - Here they are. I'm getting out our
hiking outfits.\\
189 - We are going to climb a mountain.\\
190 - I am not gonna let you sit around
here all day worrying.\\
191 - No, I'd better hang around here.\\
192 - What for? You can't rehearse without
the band,\\
193 - and they can't possibly get here
until tonight.\\
194 - Now, come on, honey, it'll do you
good.\\
195 - Well... where's Fred and Ethel?\\
196 - They're out renting some outfits,\\
197 - and the hotel's packing us a great
big fat lunch.\\
198 - Now, come on, hurry up and change.\\
199 - ETHEL: Ah-yodel-lay-hee, a lay-hee-oh\\
200 - Yodel-lay-he, oh, yodel lay-he
a-lady-oh, lady-ah.\\
201 - (laughing)\\
202 - (Lucy starts laughing)\\
203 - Well, what are you laughing at?\\
204 - Didn't you ever see Swiss mountain
climbers before?\\
205 - Oh, Fred, those are not
mountain-climbing outfits.\\
206 - You look like you came out of a Swiss
clock.\\
207 - (laughing harder)\\
208 - I got it, honey!\\
209 - Be careful now.\\
210 - Watch your footing there.\\
211 - LUCY: Okay.\\
212 - Come on. Here, honey.\\
213 - There we go. Up we go.\\
214 - Oh!\\
215 - Yeah!
Boy, we made it!\\
216 - Isn't it beautiful?\\
217 - Oh, honey, why did I forget my
camera?\\
218 - Come on, Fred!\\
219 - I'm coming.\\
220 - Come on, boy.
You need any help?\\
221 - Here you go.\\
222 - Come on, Ethel.\\
223 - Ethel!\\
224 - Where's Ethel?\\
225 - Ethel!
Ethel!\\
226 - ETHEL: I'm coming, I'm coming.\\
227 - Come on, honey!\\
228 - Honey, give me your hand.\\
229 - Give me your hand.\\
230 - Here you go.
Give me yours.\\
231 - Come on.
(grunting)\\
232 - What happened to you, Ethel?\\
233 - Oh, I untied the rope.\\
234 - I got tired of him yanking on me.\\
235 - I was scared to death when I didn't
find you\\
236 - on the end of that rope.\\
237 - Really, honey? Were you afraid you'd
lose me?\\
238 - I'll say. That outfit you're wearing
is rented.\\
239 - All right.\\
240 - Oh, honey, look how thrilling!\\
241 - Isn't it beautiful, honey?\\
242 - I'm sure glad you talked me into
coming.\\
243 - I feel better already.\\
244 - ETHEL: Look down there!\\
245 - Look how high up we are!\\
246 - FRED: Isn't it wonderful?\\
247 - Hey, is anybody hungry?\\
248 - Oh, I am. I'm starved.
LUCY: Me, too.\\
249 - Listen, it looks like it might snow.\\
250 - You think it'd be better if we go to
that shelter\\
251 - that we passed on the way over here
and eat there?\\
252 - Oh, no, honey, it's so beautiful.\\
253 - Let's eat our lunch here on top of
the world.\\
254 - ETHEL: Yeah. We may never get another
chance like this.\\
255 - Okay. Come on.
We can?\\
256 - Sure. Let's eat it right here.\\
257 - Oh, boy, I can't wait...\\
258 - ETHEL: Oh, boy, that was good.\\
259 - Wasn't that lunch good?\\
260 - (shrieks)\\
261 - Gee, this high altitude sure gives me
an appetite.\\
262 - What's your excuse at sea level?\\
263 - Oh... Fred.\\
264 - Well, they certainly make\\
265 - man-size sandwiches at that hotel,
don't they?\\
266 - Hey, look, Rick, snow!\\
267 - Oh, it is!
Yeah.\\
268 - We'd better start back.\\
269 - Oh, yeah, let's get going.\\
270 - But isn't this beautiful?
It sure is.\\
271 - ETHEL: Uh-huh. Oh, fellas!\\
272 - It's really snowing.
Here, honey.\\
273 - Okay.
Start tying up.\\
274 - Can I help you?
Can I get down down first?\\
275 - Here, Ethel.\\
276 - All righty.\\
277 - I'll just carry it.\\
278 - With that lunch you packed away,\\
279 - I doubt if there's enough rope left
to go around you.\\
280 - Oh, there's enough.\\
281 - There's enough, don't worry.\\
282 - Be sure there is.
Yeah.\\
283 - I don't want to lose you again.\\
284 - RICKY: Oh, it's really coming down
now.\\
285 - Whoo, it's coming down!\\
286 - I'll go first, huh?\\
287 - RICKY: Come on, everybody, mush!\\
288 - Mush?\\
289 - Mush!
Mush?\\
290 - ETHEL: Whoo, boy!\\
291 - Oh, this is a blizzard now.\\
292 - Oh, my goodness.\\
293 - Oh, what a nice little place!\\
294 - It's a nice little cabin, Ricky.\\
295 - Yeah, it's chilly in here.\\
296 - I wonder if we can get this old stove
started.\\
297 - Oh, big shot-- now that he isn't the
landlord,\\
298 - he's gonna turn on the heat.\\
299 - (laughs)\\
300 - There's no wood around here.\\
301 - Oh, well, we don't need a fire.\\
302 - We're gonna leave as soon as it stops
snowing.\\
303 - Yeah. Oh, it's really coming down
now.\\
304 - Yeah.
Wow.\\
305 - Look at that!\\
306 - LUCY: What?\\
307 - There's a big cliff of snow\\
308 - hanging right over the cabin.\\
309 - Oh, honey, you think that's
dangerous?\\
310 - No, I don't think so.\\
311 - (whistles)\\
312 - Fred, don't do that.\\
313 - What's the matter with you?\\
314 - Well, I thought one of those\\
315 - Saint Bernards might be going by.\\
316 - I could use a shot of brandy.\\
317 - Oh.
(whistling)\\
318 - Will you stop that! Come in here and
close the door.\\
319 - All right.\\
320 - For heaven's sake.\\
321 - Now, don't make a sound.\\
322 - What's the matter, honey?\\
323 - All that snow hanging over our head--\\
324 - a loud noise will cause an avalanche.\\
325 - (chortling)\\
326 - It's true-- I read it in a book.\\
327 - And you remember that picture\\
328 - Seven brides For Seven Brothers?\\
329 - Yeah, that's right.\\
330 - Somebody shot a pistol\\
331 - and it caused a great, big avalanche.\\
332 - Yeah. Now, don't anybody move.\\
333 - You don't have to stand around\\
334 - looking like statues.\\
335 - Just act natural, you know?\\
336 - Well... okay, All right.\\
337 - but don't make any sharp noise.\\
338 - Not even a sneeze.\\
339 - Whatever you do, don't sneeze.\\
340 - Oh, Lucy, why did you have to say
that?\\
341 - You know the power of suggestion.\\
342 - Now we'll all have to sneeze.\\
343 - Oh, Ethel, just because I said don't
sneeze,\\
344 - four people are suddenly gonna...\\
345 - Aah.... aah...\\
346 - Easy. Easy.\\
347 - Aah...\\
348 - Oh.\\
349 - Whew.\\
350 - Must be the dust in here.\\
351 - Yeah.\\
352 - (loud sneeze)
What...\\
353 - Oh, wow, that was close!\\
354 - (door slams)\\
355 - (loud rumbling)\\
356 - (screaming)
Oh, Fred!\\
357 - An avalanche!
Fred!\\
358 - An avalanche!\\
359 - An avalanche!\\
360 - Shh-shh-shh...
It's okay, honey.\\
361 - It is!\\
362 - (panicked shouting)\\
363 - It's all right, honey.\\
364 - Oh!\\
365 - (rumbling subsiding)\\
366 - Oh...\\
367 - ETHEL: Oh...\\
368 - Phew!
Oh, honey...\\
369 - It's all right, dear.\\
370 - (crying)\\
371 - Honey, let me see if I got a match,
honey.\\
372 - Let me see, wait a minute.\\
373 - (wailing)
That's all right, dear.\\
374 - See-- let's see, wait a minute.\\
375 - Let me see if I can get the lamp.\\
376 - Get a light here.\\
377 - There we go.\\
378 - Yeah.\\
379 - Let me get the door.\\
380 - Uh-oh, I can't open the door.\\
381 - LUCY: Oh, the snow is in front of the
door!\\
382 - It's all down in front of the door!\\
383 - Over close to Rick now.\\
384 - RICKY: One, two, three.
At the same time.\\
385 - One, two, three!\\
386 - Oh!\\
387 - Harder.
Harder.\\
388 - One, two, three!\\
389 - Ow!\\
390 - Now wait a minute, it's no use.\\
391 - It's no use.
The door...\\
392 - Must be a lot of snow in there.\\
393 - Oh.. How about the window, Rick?\\
394 - The window!
Yeah.\\
395 - Too small.
Even if we could open it,\\
396 - we couldn't get out there.\\
397 - There's all snow in front of it, too.\\
398 - All down in front of the window, too.\\
399 - Well...
how'd they get out\\
400 - in Seven Brides For Seven Brothers?\\
401 - They waited for the spring thaw.\\
402 - Oh, great.\\
403 - Well, I wouldn't mind that if we had
five more brides.\\
404 - Fred, this is no time to be funny.\\
405 - No! What's gonna happen to us?\\
406 - Now, now, honey...\\
407 - We're all gonna freeze to death.\\
408 - That's what's gonna happen to us.\\
409 - Now...
Oh, what a horrible fate,\\
410 - trapped under tons and tons of snow!\\
411 - Now, dear...\\
412 - Somebody will come along and dig us
up.\\
413 - Yeah, next spring.\\
414 - Next spring!\\
415 - Now, now, now, now, now, now...\\
416 - Look, now, listen to me, you two.\\
417 - Don't panic now.\\
418 - (bawling)\\
419 - Don't panic!\\
420 - The first thing we got to do, the
main thing we got to do\\
421 - is got to figure a way to get out of
here.\\
422 - After all, I got a show to put on
tonight.\\
423 - (Ethel gasps)\\
424 - How can you think about a stale show\\
425 - when we're all about to be turned
into human popsicles?\\
426 - Well, don't pick on me.\\
427 - You were the one who slammed the
door.\\
428 - Yes, and you were also the one who
sneezed.\\
429 - Yeah, and you were also the one\\
430 - that had the hot idea about going
mountain climbing.\\
431 - Oh, well, so I did a few wrong
things.\\
432 - I wasn't the only one.\\
433 - We wouldn't be here in the first
place\\
434 - if Fred hadn't bungled\\
435 - and sent the band to the wrong place.\\
436 - She's right. This is all your fault.\\
437 - Is that so?
Is that so?!\\
438 - Oh, what a dumb- bunny trick!\\
439 - It's your fault. You're the one that
sat on my glasses.\\
440 - My fault?
Yes!\\
441 - Well, actually, the whole thing is
Ricky's fault.\\
442 - My fault?\\
443 - Yes. If you hadn't left Cuba and come
to America,\\
444 - we wouldn't have gotten married\\
445 - and we wouldn't be in Switzerland in
the first place!\\
446 - Mira, que tiene cosa...\\
447 - Oh, never mind all that Spanish!\\
448 - Mira, que tiene cosa, my foot!\\
449 - (all talking over each other)\\
450 - I'm always blamed for everything.\\
451 - All right, now, wait a minute now.\\
452 - Wait a minute, fellas.
Settle down.\\
453 - This is no time to quarrel.\\
454 - The four of us are gonna spend\\
455 - the rest of our life together--\\
456 - what's left of it.\\
457 - You're right, Ethel.\\
458 - I'm sorry, honey.\\
459 - I'm sorry I blamed you.\\
460 - Well, I'm sorry I said your show was
stale.\\
461 - That's all right.\\
462 - Fred, I'm sorry\\
463 - I called you a dumb bunny.\\
464 - And I'm sorry you're so fat, you
broke my glasses.\\
465 - Oh, Fred!\\
466 - Just a minute, everybody, please,
now.\\
467 - We have to concentrate.\\
468 - We have to use our brains.\\
469 - Well, now, let me see.\\
470 - You stay out of this.\\
471 - Well, I got a good idea.\\
472 - What?\\
473 - Why don't we look up the stovepipe?\\
474 - If we can see the sky, we know it's
not too bad.\\
475 - Hey, she really has got an idea.\\
476 - Yeah. How about that?\\
477 - You know, I knew if I waited long
enough,\\
478 - you would come up with one.\\
479 - Congratulations.\\
480 - Thank you.\\
481 - Okay, Rick?\\
482 - Let's see, what do we do?\\
483 - Just take that elbow out.\\
484 - Just knock it right down.
Yeah, right down.\\
485 - Oh, yeah.\\
486 - It's a good thing it isn't hot, huh?\\
487 - Yeah. Yeah, you...\\
488 - LUCY: Oh! Oh!\\
489 - Oh, honey!\\
490 - Oh, honey, I'm sorry.\\
491 - Oh, I'm sorry, honey.\\
492 - Oh, it seemed like a good idea, baby.\\
493 - Well, you might not have much time
left,\\
494 - but you're sure going out true to
form.\\
495 - Dear, well, did you see any sky?\\
496 - No, I didn't see any sky!\\
497 - Oh, baby...\\
498 - FRED: Well, what do we do now?\\
499 - We'll just have to wait here\\
500 - until somebody comes and digs us out,
I guess.\\
501 - LUCY: Oh...\\
502 - Gee, It's been five hours already.\\
503 - How much longer is it gonna be?\\
504 - I don't know, but there's nothing we
can do about it.\\
505 - You think anybody knows where we are?\\
506 - Well, there must be.\\
507 - The people at the inn knew we come up
here.\\
508 - Well, they'll probably find us.\\
509 - How can they under all this snow?\\
510 - It may take days or even weeks.\\
511 - Weeks?
Yeah.\\
512 - Oh, I can't go that long without
food.\\
513 - I'm hungry already.\\
514 - Me, too.\\
515 - Well, we haven't got any food.\\
516 - ETHEL: Not even one little crumb?\\
517 - RICKY: No! You wanted to eat on top
of the mountain.\\
518 - You said, "We want to eat on top of
the world."\\
519 - So you ate on top of the world. Now
we got no food,\\
520 - so forget about the food.\\
521 - Just forget it.
We haven't got it.\\
522 - ETHEL: Kind of a tough thing to do to
forget about food.\\
523 - Well, what are you gonna do?\\
524 - (crackling)\\
525 - What was that?\\
526 - What was what?\\
527 - I didn't hear anything.\\
528 - I didn't neither.\\
529 - Oh, fine, now I'm beginning to hear
things.\\
530 - Yeah.\\
531 - (crackling)\\
532 - There it goes again.\\
533 - I heard it, too.\\
534 - I didn't hear anything.\\
535 - Maybe it's the ice breaking.\\
536 - Maybe it's the ice breaking, yeah.\\
537 - No. That sounded like paper rustling.\\
538 - FRED: Well, it's probably a mouse.\\
539 - Yeah, a mouse.\\
540 - ETHEL: Well...\\
541 - That's all we need now.\\
542 - ETHEL: I smell cheese!\\
543 - FRED: So do I!\\
544 - Me, too!\\
545 - It's that mouse!\\
546 - He brought his own cheese!\\
547 - Well, I want some of it.\\
548 - So do I!\\
549 - A pretty smart mouse.\\
550 - He brought his own mustard, too.\\
551 - Lucy, what you got under your coat?\\
552 - Nothing! Nothing!\\
553 - Lucy, what you got under your coat?\\
554 - Nothing!\\
555 - Come on!\\
556 - Oh, it's mine.
A sandwich!\\
557 - It's mine, it's mine!\\
558 - I want a bite of it!\\
559 - No, no, it's mine.
You had yours.\\
560 - Well, give me a bite of it!\\
561 - No, it's mine.\\
562 - Fred, let's take it away from her!\\
563 - No, it's my sandwich!\\
564 - Just a minute, just a minute.\\
565 - She's right.
We ate ours.\\
566 - It's her sandwich.\\
567 - So there.\\
568 - Besides, it'll be better this way.\\
569 - One of us will be alive and strong.\\
570 - When the rescuers get here, they can
tell\\
571 - how brave we were till the end.\\
572 - Well, it is mine.\\
573 - Of course it's yours, honey.\\
574 - You have every right in the world\\
575 - to go ahead and eat your sandwich--\\
576 - even though we're standing here\\
577 - in front of your eyes, starving to
death.\\
578 - (whimpering)\\
579 - (whimpering)\\
580 - Oh, all right, I'll divide it.\\
581 - Oh, Lucy, I knew you would.\\
582 - Gee, thanks.
Thanks.\\
583 - Oh, boy, is that good.\\
584 - ETHEL: Mmm...\\
585 - Oh, dear.\\
586 - They're never gonna get us out of
here.\\
587 - Now, honey.\\
588 - She's right.\\
589 - We're doomed.\\
590 - Now, don't talk that way.\\
591 - Gee, I wouldn't believe the end would
be like this.\\
592 - I'm too young to go.\\
593 - So am I.\\
594 - (Lucy and Ethel crying)\\
595 - Now, get ahold of yourselves.\\
596 - Get ahold of yourselves.\\
597 - Yeah.\\
598 - If this is it and I've got to go,\\
599 - I want to go with a clear conscience.\\
600 - Fred, I've got a confession to make
to you.\\
601 - Well, what is it, honey bunch?\\
602 - You remember when we were married, I
said I was 18?\\
603 - Yeah.\\
604 - I was 19.\\
605 - I got something to tell you, too.\\
606 - What?\\
607 - You were 24.
Oh...\\
608 - While we're on the subject,\\
609 - I got a confession to make to you.\\
610 - What's that, Fred?\\
611 - Well, Rick, I've been charging you\\
612 - ten dollars a month more rent\\
613 - than anybody else in the building.\\
614 - I got another confession to make.\\
615 - Every month I gave them back the ten
dollars.\\
616 - Oh, boy, if I thought\\
617 - I was gonna get out of here alive,\\
618 - would I let you have it?\\
619 - Ricky, don't you have a confession to
make?\\
620 - Not me-- I'm no fool.
We might be saved.\\
621 - Well, I got a confession to make.\\
622 - What's that, honey?\\
623 - I got another whole sandwich in my
knapsack.\\
624 - Well, you know, now that I think
about it,\\
625 - I do have a confession to make.\\
626 - What?\\

up the mail\\
22 - at the American Express office.\\
23 - He'll probably bring you a whole slew
of it.\\
24 - Oh, he'd better. Today is Little
Ricky's third birthday.\\
25 - I don't even know if he got my
birthday presents or not.\\
26 - Oh, he'll get the presents all right.\\
27 - I mailed them a couple weeks ago.\\
28 - Oh, brother, if you mailed them,\\
29 - he'll be lucky if he gets them for
his 23rd birthday.\\
30 - Will you get off of my back?\\
31 - Where is everybody?\\

72 - That elevator, she's a no bust, she's
a pooped.\\
73 - The very best place in the hotel--\\
74 - the bridal suite.\\

while they're young.\\
77 - Where's our room?\\

79 - One flight up!\\
80 - What did you give us--\\
81 - the bridal suite for mountain goats?\\
82 - Come on, Ethel.\\

84 - I got to stay at this level for a
while\\
85 - or I'll get the bends.\\

99 - Yeah.
Ooh.\\
100 - Anything for me?\\
101 - Yep.\\
102 - (groans)\\
103 - (loud thud)\\
104 - What's this? A box springs without
springs?\\
105 - We got four letters from Mother!\\
106 - Oh, good.\\
107 - Now, which one was mailed first?\\
108 - Ethel, you ought to see our room.\\
109 - There's a flock of pigeons right
outside the window.\\
110 - Those aren't pigeons up there,
they're angels.\\
111 - Here.\\
112 - Oh, thanks.\\
113 - Oh, dear!\\
114 - RICKY: What's the matter, honey?\\
115 - Little Ricky has a bad cold and
Mother has kept him\\
116 - out of nursery school for three whole
days!\\
117 - Well, honey, you know how kids are.\\
118 - They all get colds.\\
119 - He'll be all right.\\
120 - You sound just like a father:\\
121 - "They all get colds.\\
122 - He'll be all right.
He'll be all right."\\
123 - Oh, wonderful!\\
124 - What does that letter say?\\
125 - Says he's all right.\\
126 - See?\\
127 - Fred, here's a letter from Mrs.
Trumbull.\\

129 - Well, let's see what she has to say.\\

131 - Good girl!\\
132 - And she says the furnace broke down
last Monday\\
133 - and there was no heat all week.\\
134 - (chuckling)\\
135 - "The repairman finally fixed it
yesterday\\
136 - and I'm enclosing the bill."\\
137 - (wry chuckle)\\
138 - $118.00!
Is she off her nut?\\
139 - Oh, now, calm down, scrooge.\\
140 - It's cold in New York.\\
141 - She's got to keep the tenants warm.\\
142 - It would have been cheaper\\
143 - to send them all to Florida for the
winter.\\
144 - $118!\\
145 - That old doll is off her...\\
146 - (loud thud)\\
147 - (thudding)\\
148 - You're in luck, you got a soft one.\\
149 - Oh, dear!\\
150 - RICKY: What's the matter now?\\
151 - Mother doesn't say a thing about the
birthday presents we sent.\\
152 - Well, you know how your mother is.\\
153 - She always forgets to tell you
things.\\
154 - Oh, no, honey, she wouldn't forget to
tell me that.\\
155 - He just didn't get them, the poor
little thing.\\
156 - Fred, are you sure you mailed those
birthday presents?\\
157 - Yes, I'm sure I mailed those birthday
presents!\\
158 - Poor baby, all alone in New York on
his birthday,\\
159 - no birthday presents.\\
160 - He'll think nobody loves him.\\

2 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
3 - (theme song ending)\\
4 - ANNOUNCER: And now, "I Love Lucy."\\
5 - (applause)\\
6 - Gee, these Italian trains sure are
cramped.\\
7 - Imagine one seat for four people.\\
8 - Ethel, will you stop complaining?\\
9 - Well, it's true-- they're not very
roomy.\\
10 - They're roomy enough.\\
11 - It's just that you're roomier.\\
12 - Oh...\\
13 - Well, it's not so bad now that Lucy's
not here.\\
14 - Yeah. Where'd she go?\\
15 - Just out to stretch her legs.\\
16 - Honestly!\\
17 - What's the matter?\\
18 - There's a man out there\\
19 - leering at me.\\
20 - He's a typical masher.\\
21 - Lucy, why is it that every time you
get on a train,\\
22 - you start imagining things?\\
23 - I am not imagining things.\\
24 - I know a masher when I...\\
25 - (gasps) There he is now.\\
26 - Now, Ricky, don't lose your temper.\\
27 - Why should I lose my temper?\\
28 - Aren't you going to beat him up?\\
29 - What for?\\
30 - "What for?"\\
31 - Oh, honey, calm down.
He didn't do anything.\\
32 - Well... he was thinking.\\
33 - Where was I sitting?\\
34 - Right beside me.\\
35 - Where?\\
36 - Gee, it was there a minute ago.\\
37 - Come on, move over.\\
38 - Shove over.
Get over, Fred.\\
39 - Come on, get over.\\
40 - I'll get over.\\
41 - Let me get my dress.\\
42 - Such a train.\\
43 - Fred, at what time do we get to Rome?\\
44 - 10:00.\\
45 - Oh. Well, that's... only just about
one more hour.\\
46 - That won't be so bad in this torture.\\
47 - Well, I mean, that-that's, uh...\\
48 - 10:00 tomorrow morning.\\
49 - What?!
What?!\\
50 - You mean we have to sit like this all
night?\\
51 - Well, it's only 13 more hours.\\
52 - If I could only reach you,\\
53 - I'd punch you right in the nose.\\
54 - Fred, why didn't you get us berths?\\
55 - Well, it's cheaper this way.\\
56 - Oh, fine.\\
57 - Well, as Ricky's band manager, it's
my job...\\
58 - To save money.
To save money.\\
59 - I appreciate that, Fred,\\
60 - but you got to draw the line
someplace.\\
61 - Oh, we're lucky he hasn't got us
hitchhiking.\\
62 - Will you stop yapping?\\
63 - Oh, 13 more hours in this sardine
can.\\
64 - Sardines were better off.\\
65 - They got all that oil to wiggle
around in.\\
66 - Well, let-let's try to get some
sleep, huh?\\
67 - Sleep?\\
68 - (Fred snoring)\\
69 - (snoring)\\
70 - Oh, Lucy, it's no use.\\
71 - We've got to have more room.\\
72 - This is all Fred's fault.\\
73 - Let him stand up.\\
74 - (Fred snoring)\\
75 - Fred.\\
76 - Fred.\\
77 - Wake up, sleeping beauty.\\
78 - You couldn't wake him up with a stick
of dynamite.\\
79 - Hey, I got an idea.\\
80 - Hey, look, there goes Gina
Lollobrigida!\\
81 - Where? Where?\\
82 - (mocking laugh)\\
83 - Now, what's the big idea?\\
84 - Well, you got us into this.\\
85 - You can just stand up.\\
86 - Ethel, I'm not going to forget this.\\
87 - Fred.\\
88 - Oh!\\
89 - What are you trying to do?\\
90 - Oh...\\
91 - Honestly!\\
92 - Oh, honey, help me.
I can't move.\\
93 - I'll help you.\\
94 - Here, dear.\\
95 - Oh, dear.\\
96 - I may never play the violin again.\\
97 - Where are we?
Where are we?\\
98 - We're just pulling into the station.\\
99 - Oh.
Come on, Fred.\\
100 - Help me with these bags.\\
101 - Here, I'll take this one.	     
  Oh, boy.\\
102 - Give me that one.\\
103 - Honey, there's that man again.\\
104 - Yeah, he is looking kind of funny at
you.\\
105 - I told you he was a masher.\\
106 - Is there anything I can do for you?\\
107 - Excuse me, signor.\\
108 - I am afraid I have given the wrong
impression.\\
109 - Yeah, well!\\
110 - Allow me to introduce myself.\\
111 - I am Vittorio Fellipi.\\

118 - Yep.\\
119 - Oh! I've seen all of your pictures\\

121 - They're, they're, they're so
realistic and earthy.\\
122 - Thank you.
Thank you.\\
123 - Well, we'd better introduce
ourselves.\\
124 - My name is Ricky Ricardo.\\
125 - Ricky Ricardo, well!\\
126 - I read you were traveling in Europe.\\
127 - Oh, you did.\\
128 - How about that?\\
129 - That's nice.
He read it in a paper.\\

How do you do, Mrs. Mertz.\\
134 - And Mr. Mertz.\\
135 - Hi.
Glad to know you, sir.\\
136 - How are you? Grazie.\\
137 - I shouldn't have been staring at Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
138 - Oh, that's all right.\\
139 - But you see, she happens to be just
the type\\
140 - I need for a new picture.\\
141 - Who, me?\\
142 - Yes.\\
143 - Tell me, Mrs. Ricardo,\\
144 - have you ever considered acting?\\
145 - ETHEL, RICKY AND FRED: Has she ever
considered acting?\\
146 - Well... uh...\\
147 - (imitating Katharine Hepburn):\\
148 - The calla lilies are in bloom again.\\
149 - Really, they are.\\
150 - I mean...\\
151 - (ITALIAN ACCENT): Oh, those calla
lil-- mama mia!--\\
152 - they got to be a-blooming.\\
153 - Very nice, very nice, indeed.\\
154 - Look, here, Mr. Ricardo, here's my
card.\\
155 - If your charming wife would be
interested in auditioning,\\
156 - call me, please...
but do it soon.\\
157 - You see, we start production in a few

174 - The Colosseum!\\
175 - Oh, isn't it magnificent?\\
176 - Aah, it's nothing, Rick.\\
177 - Nothing!\\
178 - Smaller than the Yankee Stadium.\\
179 - Joe DiMaggio would have hit 80 home
runs\\
180 - in that hat box.\\
181 - Oh, what can I expect\\
182 - when I expose him to culture?\\
183 - (Ricky laughs)\\
184 - Come on, Lucy, take a look at it.\\
185 - I saw it. Listen, here's a big
article\\
186 - about Vittorio Fellipi in here\\
187 - and-and pictures of some of the
actresses he's discovered.\\
188 - Aren't they earthy?\\
189 - Wow!\\
190 - Oh, I don't think\\
191 - those Italian actresses are so much.\\
192 - Not one of them has got her hair
combed.\\
193 - Well, they look great to me.\\
194 - Hmm, if I let my hair go like that,\\
195 - you'd never let me hear the end of
it.\\
196 - Honeybunch, if the rest of you looked
like that,\\
197 - I wouldn't care if you were bald.\\
198 - Oh, fine.\\
199 - Ricky?\\
200 - Yeah, honey.\\
201 - Do you like earthy women?\\
202 - What's earthy?\\
203 - That.\\
204 - Well, we don't call that earthy in
Cuba.\\
205 - Oh? What do you call it?\\
206 - We have five words for it:\\
207 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
208 - (chuckling)\\
209 - (knock on door)\\
210 - Come in.\\
211 - The hangers you called for, signor.\\
212 - Oh, yeah, yes.\\
213 - Oh, uh... Signor Bellboy.\\
214 - Si, signora.\\
215 - Would you, uh, translate\\
216 - this story for me on Vittorio
Fellipi?\\
217 - I don't understand the Italian, you
know.\\
218 - Si, si, con piacere.\\
219 - Uh, it says here:\\
220 - "Signor Vittorio Fellipi has
announced\\
221 - "the starting date of his newest
picture\\
222 - "which will be called, uh...\\
223 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!\\
224 - How about that?\\
225 - It's the same thing in Italy.\\
226 - Scusi, signora.\\
227 - The name of the picture will be
Grappolo Pungente.\\
228 - Grappolo... what does that mean?\\
229 - It means "Bitter Grapes."\\
230 - "Bitter Grapes"?
Si.\\
231 - Oh, what else does it say?\\
232 - "The picture will be filmed in color\\
233 - and will be shot in and around Rome."\\
234 - Uh-huh. Go on.\\
235 - That's all there is.
E finito.\\
236 - Oh. Well, thank you very much.\\
237 - Belle bambine tutte queste, ma come
sono belle! Bellissima.\\
238 - Would you like to take the magazine
with you?\\
239 - Oh, grazie.\\
240 - You're welcome.\\
241 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
242 - (Ricky laughing)\\
243 - Oh...\\
244 - Gee, did you hear that, honey?\\
245 - It's going to be called Bitter
Grapes.\\
246 - I wonder what part they want me for.\\
247 - Oh, you're probably going to be one
of the bunch.\\
248 - (laughs)\\
249 - Fred, that's funny.\\
250 - Very funny.\\
251 - Gee, I got to find out about the
grape vineyards--\\
252 - how the workers act,\\
253 - what they do there.\\
254 - Lucy...
There must be\\
255 - some grape vineyards\\
256 - near here someplace.
Lucy...\\
257 - I bet I can learn all about them in a
couple of hours.\\
258 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
259 - Why not?\\
260 - Look, honey, Italy has enough
problems already.\\
261 - I don't want to have to worry\\
262 - about you lousing up the entire grape
industry.\\
263 - Oh...\\
264 - All I want to do is soak up a little
local color\\
265 - so I'll know what I'm acting about.\\
266 - What could possibly happen to me?\\
267 - Well, I could answer that,\\
268 - but we're only gonna be here ten
days.\\
269 - Oh...
Come on, Fred.\\
270 - FRED: Okay.
Let's check the theater.\\
271 - ETHEL: So long, Fred.
See you later.\\
272 - No funny business-- promise?\\
273 - All right, all right.\\
274 - All right.\\
275 - See you later.\\
276 - Come on, Ethel, let's go.\\
277 - Go where?\\
278 - To the grape vineyards!
Where else?\\
279 - You promised Ricky you wouldn't.\\
280 - I did not. I promised him no funny
business.\\
281 - Soaking up local color for acting
purposes\\
282 - happens to be a very serious
business.\\
283 - Oh, brother.\\
284 - Besides, the only reason he doesn't
want me to go\\
285 - is 'cause he doesn't want me to be in
that picture.\\
286 - Now, don't start that\\
287 - he-doesn't-want-me- in-show-business
stuff.\\
288 - Well, he doesn't.\\
289 - How could I find out where the grape
vineyards are?\\
290 - Just look in the yellow pages of the
phone book.\\
291 - Operator, would you ask\\
292 - the bellboy to come up to 605,
please? Thank you.\\
293 - I'll ask him where they are.\\
294 - So, you find a vineyard.\\
295 - What are you gonna do about the, uh,
fact\\
296 - that you don't speak Italian?\\
297 - I know a few words.\\
298 - When I don't know, I'll shrug.\\
299 - How can you shrug a conversation?\\
300 - Ethel, you have been in Italy for a
week.\\
301 - Haven't you learned anything?\\
302 - What does this mean?\\
303 - It's wonderful?\\
304 - Right.\\
305 - How about this?\\
306 - Who knows?\\
307 - Very good.\\
308 - Uh...\\
309 - Don't cut the spaghetti; wind it
around the fork!\\
310 - (laughs)\\
311 - No.\\
312 - What's this?\\
313 - Ooh, I give up.\\
314 - What is it?\\
315 - Get me a large pizza.\\
316 - (knock at door)\\
317 - Come in.\\
318 - Si, signora, you sent for me?\\
319 - Yes. I'd like a little information,
please.\\
320 - I'd like to know a little bit about
the wine industry,\\
321 - how they make the wine, how they pick
the grapes,\\
322 - and how they press the juice out with
their feet.\\
323 - Are there any grape vineyards around
here?\\
324 - Well, uh, there's only one little
town called Turo,\\
325 - where they still make wine like that,
you know.\\
326 - All other wineries are modern.\\
327 - They use big machinery.\\
328 - Oh, oh. Well, where is this Turo?\\
329 - Oh, it's right on the outskirts of
the city.\\
330 - Oh, well, thank you very much.\\
331 - Prego.
Turo, Turo.\\
332 - You want to come along?\\
333 - No, thanks.\\
334 - What am I gonna tell Ricky when he
asks where you are?\\
335 - Tell him anything you want.
I have nothing to hide.\\
336 - Tell him the truth.\\
337 - Okay, I'll tell him the truth.\\
338 - Don't you dare!\\
339 - No, I won't.\\
340 - All right.\\
341 - Andiamo, andiamo!\\
342 - (chattering excitedly in Italian)\\
343 - (all talking over each other)\\
344 - Buon giorno, buon giorno.\\
345 - (everyone speaking at once)\\
346 - No, e troppo caldo.\\
347 - Allora, sta sera.\\
348 - Magari, si.\\
349 - Senti, senti.\\

366 - Che vuoi, che hai visto?\\
367 - Vai al lavoro subito.\\
368 - Vai a lavorare, cammina.\\

370 - Eh, tu, vieni qua.\\
371 - La raccolta e stata buona\\
372 - e noi due dobbiamo\\
373 - pigiare tutta questa uva.\\
374 - Preghiamo che non stare qui fino sta
notte.\\
375 - Fa presto.\\
376 - Eh, vieni dentro!\\
377 - (yelling in Italian)\\
378 - Lucy?\\
379 - Lucy?\\
380 - Oh, hi, Rick.
Is Lucy back yet?\\
381 - No, she's not here.\\
382 - Well, good-bye, Rick.\\
383 - Ethel!\\
384 - Come back here.\\
385 - Where is Lucy?\\
386 - Lucy?\\
387 - Yeah. Vittorio Fellipi called and
he's coming over.\\
388 - Where is she?\\
389 - Where is she?\\
390 - Ethel, where did Lucy go?\\
391 - Where did Lucy go?\\
392 - Will you stop repeating everything I
say?\\
393 - Where did she go?\\
394 - Well...\\
395 - Ethel, did she go shopping?\\
396 - I promised not to tell.\\
397 - Did she go around sucking up local
color?\\
398 - "Sucking up lacal color?"\\
399 - No, I don't think so.\\
400 - Ethel!\\
401 - Yes.\\
402 - Mira que tiene cosa\\

407 - What do you mean keep her out of that
movie?\\
408 - I just don't want her to go around\\
409 - and get herself into trouble again.\\
410 - Really?\\
411 - Why would I ask Vittorio Fellipi to
come over here\\
412 - if I didn't want her in the movie?\\
413 - Why, that's right.\\
414 - Sure!\\
415 - Now, don't you worry about it, Ricky.\\
416 - She just probably picked a few grapes\\
417 - and she's on her way home right now.\\
418 - Yeah, well, I hope you're right.\\
419 - Yeah, I'm sure of it.\\
420 - No, I'm a-pooped.\\
421 - Abbasta!\\
422 - Dai, lavora!\\
423 - Poverina, e che credi?\\
424 - Ti piglia la paga senza far nulla?\\
425 - Naah!\\
426 - Oh!\\
427 - (both yelling)\\
428 - Allora ci vogliamo divertire de vero,
eh?\\
429 - E va bene, adesso.\\
430 - I'm sorry, Signor Ricardo,\\
431 - I-I cannot wait any longer, really.\\
432 - Oh, gee, that's too bad.\\
433 - She's gonna be awful sorry\\
434 - that she missed you.\\
435 - Oh, she's so anxious to be in your
picture.\\
436 - I'm sorry, but you see,\\
437 - I have to go back at the studio. I'm
late.\\
438 - ETHEL: Well, just a few minutes
longer.\\
439 - Just... I'm sure she'll...\\
440 - No!\\
441 - Oh!\\
442 - Oh, Signor Fellipi.\\
443 - How do you do?\\
444 - Oh, you'll have to excuse the way I
look,\\
445 - but I've been working in the grape
vineyards\\
446 - so I could get the proper atmosphere\\
447 - for working in your picture.\\
448 - FRED: Boy, when it comes\\
449 - to soaking up local color, you don't
mess around.\\
450 - Lucy, why don't you go and wash that
blue stuff off?\\
451 - I tried to.\\
452 - It won't come off.\\
453 - But, Mrs. Ricardo, I'm afraid you
misunderstood.\\
454 - You see, Bitter Grapes is just a... a
symbolic title.\\
455 - The picture has nothing to do with
the grape industry.\\
456 - And besides, you see, I had you in
mind\\
457 - for a small part\\
458 - as a... a typical American tourist\\
459 - visiting in Italy.\\
460 - Oh, well, fine.\\
461 - Oh, it isn't fine at all.\\
462 - You see, we're shooting the scene\\
463 - tomorrow morning in color, and I
couldn't take a chance\\
464 - that you would be back to normal by
then.\\
465 - Well... well... well,\\
466 - couldn't I be a typical American
tourist\\
467 - who... who was homesick for America\\
468 - and that's why I'm blue?\\
469 - Oh, no.\\
470 - No, no, I'm sorry.\\
471 - Well, could I be a...
a typical American tourist\\
472 - who fell in a wine vat?
No.\\
473 - Oh, please, I'll do anything.\\
474 - I'll dye my hair.
I'll do anything.\\
475 - Mrs. Ricardo, please.\\
476 - You know, the part isn't big enough\\
477 - to go through all that trouble,
really.\\
478 - Well, it's very nice of you\\
479 - to come over, Mr. Fellipi.\\
480 - It was nice meeting you.\\
481 - Thank you.\\
482 - I'm awfully sorry, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
483 - I'll shave my head.
I'll wear a mask.\\
484 - No.\\
485 - Good-bye, Mr. Mertzer.\\
486 - Good-bye.\\
487 - Good-bye, Mrs. Mertzer.\\
488 - Good-bye.
It was...\\
489 - Just a minute.\\
490 - Mrs. Mertzer, would you be interested\\
491 - in playing that part?\\
492 - Would I!\\
493 - Good.\\
494 - Oh...!\\
495 - Then report tomorrow morning\\
496 - at my studio at 8:00.\\
497 - You are a typical American tourist\\
498 - if I ever saw one.\\
499 - Oh, thank you!
Oh, thank you!\\
500 - Good-bye.
Yes, I always...\\
501 - Oh, I'll be right there at 8:00.\\
502 - Oh, imagine me in an Italian movie.\\
503 - This is only the beginning.\\
504 - I may end up being a star.\\
505 - Arrivederci, mi amore.\\
506 - Mi amore, arrivederci.\\

2 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
3 - (theme song ending)\\
4 - ANNOUNCER: And now, "I Love Lucy."\\
5 - (applause)\\
6 - Hi.\\
7 - You know you've done crazy stunts
before,\\
8 - but this is the craziest.\\
9 - I don't care. I just wanted to make
sure that I got to swim\\
10 - in the Mediter-r-r-ranean at least
once.\\
11 - But it's such a cold day.\\
12 - Wasn't it freezing?\\
13 - (quavering): Y-Y-Y-yes.\\
14 - Go and put some warm clothes on.\\
15 - Ok-k-k-k...
Ok-k-k-k...\\
16 - 'K-K-K-K-kay, yeah,\\
17 - Okay.
go ahead, go ahead.\\
18 - It was good, though; I liked it.\\
19 - FRED: I can't believe it, Ethel,
that's all.\\
20 - I just can't believe it.\\
21 - Oh, if you'll just stop talking,\\
22 - I'll prove it to you.\\
23 - Where's Lucy?\\
24 - Getting out of her bathing suit.\\
25 - There.\\
26 - All right, Ethel, I'm convinced.\\
27 - I don't know why I ever doubt\\
28 - anything Miss Crazy Quilt does.\\
29 - Yeah, you should know better than
that by now, Fred.\\
30 - Are you all packed?\\
31 - Yeah, and when you finish,\\
32 - I'm gonna send all the baggage down
to the bus depot.\\
33 - The bus depot?
Isn't there a train to Nice?\\
34 - Yeah, but the bus is cheaper, and you
know me.\\
35 - Boy, do we know you.\\
36 - Yeah.\\
37 - Besides, we'll get to see more of the
country\\
38 - if we go by bus.\\
39 - Bus? What's this about a bus?\\
40 - Well, well, if isn't\\
41 - the poor man's Florence Chadwick.\\
42 - because it's cheaper.\\
43 - Well, I vote for the train.\\
44 - And I vote for the train.\\
45 - I vote for bicycles.\\
46 - There, you see?\\
47 - Bicycles?!\\
48 - Yeah, bicycles.\\
49 - How'd that get on the ballot?\\
50 - Everybody in Italy rides bicycles.\\
51 - Why shouldn't we?\\
52 - From here to Nice?\\
53 - Oh, I looked it up on the map\\
54 - and it's only about that far from
here to Nice.\\
55 - Have you ever tried riding that far
on a bicycle?\\
56 - That's probably a hundred miles.\\
57 - That's a hundred miles?\\
58 - Actually, Nice is about 35 miles from
here.\\
59 - There, I knew that couldn't be a
hundred miles.\\
60 - Well, you'll never get me up on a
bicycle.\\
61 - On behalf of bicycle seats
everywhere, thank you.\\
62 - Oh, Fred.\\
63 - Let's forget it, honey.\\
64 - ETHEL: Yeah.\\
65 - What is the matter with the three of
you?\\
66 - You wouldn't climb to the top of the
Eiffel Tower.\\
67 - You wouldn't ride the ski lift in
Switzerland.\\
68 - You won't swim in the Mediterranean\\
69 - and now you don't want to\\
70 - bicycle along the Italian Riviera.\\
71 - Nothing personal,\\
72 - but I sure am traveling with three
wet blankets.\\
73 - Some group--\\
74 - three wet blankets and a crazy quilt.\\
75 - Well, I don't care what you do.\\
76 - You get bus tickets or train tickets,
whatever you want.\\
77 - Well, that's better.\\
78 - I am going to Nice by bicycle.\\
79 - Okay, you can go to Nice whichever
way you want to go.\\
80 - Very well, I shall.\\
81 - All right.\\
82 - That's telling her, Rick.\\
83 - Yeah, no dame's gonna lead you around
by the nose.\\
84 - Yeah.\\
85 - Fred.\\
86 - What?\\
87 - You'd better rent me two bicycles.\\
88 - What?!	    What?\\
89 - What am I gonna do?\\
90 - I can't let her ride all over Italy
by herself.\\
91 - I may never see her again.\\
92 - Yeah.\\
93 - Now, now, go ahead, get two bikes.\\
94 - You and Ethel go on the bus and we'll
meet you there.\\
95 - Well, if you're gonna do it...\\
96 - Let's do it, too, huh, Fred?\\
97 - You can get one of those bicycles
built for two.\\
98 - Yeah, that'll be fine for you, but
what am I gonna ride?\\
99 - Ah, you know, it might be fun at
that.\\
100 - Well, it'll be an experience.\\
101 - Yeah.
Honey...\\
102 - you win.\\
103 - We're all going to Nice by bicycle.\\
104 - Well, wonderful.\\
105 - Fred, you go ahead\\
106 - and rent some bicycles for all of us,
huh?\\
107 - Okey-dokey.\\
108 - That won't be necessary, Fred.\\
109 - Why not?\\
110 - I just did.\\
111 - (grunts)\\
112 - Boy, I never seen so many hills in my
life.\\
113 - Ooh, are my legs tired.\\
114 - That's good for 'em.
Makes strong leg muscles.\\
115 - Oh, sure. Just what I need.\\
116 - I can play the conga drum with my
feet.\\
117 - Well, let's rest awhile.\\
118 - Wait for Fred and Ethel.\\
119 - Don't tell me that the six-day
bicycle racer is getting tired.\\
120 - Eh, just a little.\\
121 - But I have an idea\\
122 - that Nice is right over that next
hill.\\
123 - Are you kidding?\\
124 - We haven't even reached the French
border.\\
125 - Eww...\\
126 - Eww...\\
127 - Hi.\\
128 - Oh, boy, I'm exhausted.\\
129 - Me, too, I'm beat.\\
130 - I'm just one big charley horse.\\
131 - Yeah.\\
132 - For even thinking of coming over here
by bicycle,\\
133 - I should have my head examined.\\
134 - My trouble is in an entirely
different spot.\\
135 - Come on, let's push on.\\
136 - Push on?\\
137 - Oh, honey, I'm too tired.\\
138 - Besides, it's getting late.\\
139 - Yeah, that's right.\\
140 - Don't you think we ought to find a
someplace\\
141 - to spend the night?\\
142 - Hey, Rick, there's a farmer.\\
143 - Yeah, maybe he can put us up for the
night.\\
144 - Yeah.
Uh, signor?\\
145 - Ah, salve, signori, volete qualche
cosa?\\
146 - Do you speak English?\\
147 - Huh?\\
148 - English. You speak it?\\

160 - degli americani fra di noi.\\
161 - Yeah. What'd he say?
What'd he say?\\
162 - I don't even know what I said.\\
163 - How are we gonna ask him to put us up
for the night\\
164 - if we can't talk to him?\\
165 - I know, I'll use sign language.\\
166 - Anybody can understand that.
All right.\\
167 - Um, uh... uh, signor....\\

228 - What do we do now?\\
229 - It's either stay here or get back on
the bicycles.\\
230 - What do you say, honeybunch, should
we turn in?\\
231 - Why not?\\
232 - Well, don't just stand there--\\
233 - grab a pitchfork and make up our bed.\\

328 - (screams)\\
329 - (laughing)\\
330 - (screams)\\
331 - MAN: Au revoir.\\
332 - (groans)\\
333 - Boy, we finally made it to the French
border.\\
334 - And I thought we'd never make it.\\
335 - Oh, Rick, can't we rest a little
while?\\
336 - No, let's keep going. We'll never get
to Nice. Come on.\\
337 - Where you going?\\
338 - I just want to say good-bye to Italy.\\
339 - I sure hate to leave.\\
340 - Well, hurry up.\\
341 - (sighs)\\
342 - Farewell, Italy, with your beautiful
mountains\\
343 - and your lakes and your wonderful
people.\\
344 - Good-bye, dear Italy.\\
345 - No, I'm not going to say good-bye.\\
346 - I'm going to say arrivederci!\\
347 - Hurry up.\\
348 - I'm coming.\\
349 - (sighs)\\
350 - Good-bye, paisan.\\
351 - He doesn't want to shake hands;\\
352 - he wants to see your passport.\\
353 - Oh, my passport. I'm sorry.\\
354 - Honey, haven't you got my passport?\\
355 - Look, Lucy, this is no time for
jokes.\\
356 - I'm not joking.\\
357 - Well, where is it? I told you to keep
it in a safe place.\\
358 - Oh, my gosh.\\
359 - What's the matter?\\
360 - It's in my blue purse.\\
361 - Well, where's your purse?\\
362 - Oh, my gosh.\\
363 - What now?\\
364 - Well?\\
365 - It's in that trunk that was sent
ahead to Nice.\\
366 - What?!\\
367 - How did you expect to leave Italy\\
368 - and come into France without a
passport?\\
369 - Oh, now, honey, he knows I'm with
you.\\
370 - Look, I... I-I don't have my passport
right now,\\
371 - but I'm with them, and they'll vouch
for me.\\
372 - No, no, I'm sorry.\\
373 - You cannot cross the border without a
passport.\\
374 - Now, look, I-I just told you I have a
passport,\\
375 - but I just haven't got it with me.\\
376 - Now, look, you let me go through\\
377 - and I'll get it and bring it back to
you.\\
378 - I happen to have it in a purse\\
379 - that's sent ahead in a trunk to Nice.\\
380 - No, no, signora, you cannot go
through\\
381 - without a passport.\\
382 - Ricky, do something!\\
383 - Look, if we promise you that we'll
bring her passport back.\\
384 - can she go through with us?\\
385 - Mmm... mm-hmm, I'm sorry.\\
386 - (sobbing)\\
387 - All right, all right, now, don't cry.\\
388 - Now, don't cry, honey.\\
389 - Look, there's only one thing to do:\\
390 - I'll go to Nice and get your passport
and bring it back.\\
391 - Oh, honey, would you, please?\\
392 - Yes, I will.
Come on, Fred.
Oh, thank you.\\
393 - Go with me.
We'll go on the tandem.\\
394 - We'll make better time.\\
395 - I'll stay and keep you company.\\
396 - Thank you, Ethel.\\
397 - We'll leave these knapsacks here.\\
398 - Okay, I'll keep my eye on them.\\
399 - LUCY: I'm awfully sorry, honey.\\
400 - It's all right, okay.
Now, Fred, you pedal!\\
401 - Be sure and pedal.
Thank you, honey.\\
402 - All right.
Hurry back.\\
403 - Bye.\\
404 - You saw my passport.
My husband's got it.\\
405 - I just want to go over there\\
406 - and sit with my friend for a while.\\
407 - I must have your passport, ma'am.\\
408 - I haven't got it.\\
409 - Then you cannot go over.\\
410 - Well, anyway, it's nice to know\\
411 - I have a friend right in the next
country.\\
412 - I wonder what's keeping them.\\
413 - I don't know.\\
414 - (phone rings)\\
415 - Pronto, confine italiano, si.\\
416 - Con chi parlo?
Ho capito, si, si.\\
417 - Signora, for you.\\
418 - Oh, it must be Ricky.\\
419 - Hello.\\
420 - Hello.\\
421 - LUCY: Was the trunk there, honey?\\
422 - Yeah, the trunk is here.\\
423 - Did you find my purse?\\
424 - No, I didn't.\\
425 - Why didn't you?\\
426 - Because I can't find the key to open
the trunk with.\\
427 - RICKY: Where is the key?\\
428 - It's in my blue jacket.\\
429 - Where is your blue jacket?\\
430 - It's, uh...\\
431 - Oh, my gosh.\\
432 - What's the matter now?\\
433 - I'm wearing it.\\
434 - Mira que tiene cosa a decirle...\\
435 - mandando uno para venir aca a
buscar...\\
436 - Honey, honey, here it is.\\
437 - I found the key.
I found it, honey.\\
438 - Now, look, look, why don't you\\
439 - bring the trunk out here and unlock
it?\\
440 - I'm not gonna take this trunk for a
20-mile taxicab drive.\\
441 - Well, what do you want to do?\\
442 - Just leave me here and forget about
me?\\
443 - Well...\\
444 - Oh, now!\\
445 - All right, all right, send Ethel over
here with the keys.\\
446 - All right, I will, honey. Bye.\\
447 - Ethel, you take this key to Ricky
right away.\\
448 - Ride all that way by myself?\\
449 - Well, you're going to have to ride
there anyway.\\
450 - Come on, now, be a good scout. Go
ahead.\\
451 - Oh...\\
452 - (phone rings)\\
453 - Pronto, confine italiano.\\
454 - Si, va bene, ho capito, subito.\\
455 - Signora, for you.\\
456 - What now?\\
457 - Hello?\\
458 - Hello.
Hi, honey,\\
459 - did Ethel get there?\\
460 - Did you find my purse?\\
461 - Yeah, yeah, Ethel, Ethel got here\\
462 - and, uh, she brought the key\\
463 - and we opened the trunk and we found
your purse.\\
464 - Now I have a question to ask you.\\
465 - What?\\
466 - Where is your passport?\\
467 - Well, honey, it must be in the purse.\\
468 - I distinctly remember when we left
Rome to go to San Remo,\\
469 - I knew I wouldn't need it, so I put
it in my blue purse\\
470 - and locked it in the trunk.\\
471 - Oh, wait.\\
472 - Yesterday when we left San Remo, I
remember thinking to myself:\\
473 - "Lucy," I thought to myself,\\
474 - "you're going to need that passport\\
475 - when you cross the border."\\
476 - So I...\\
477 - Oh, my gosh!\\
478 - What is "Oh, my gosh" for now?\\
479 - I put it in my knapsack.\\
480 - It's been right here all the time.\\
481 - What?!\\
482 - I got the knapsack right here,\\
483 - so the three of you go ahead and have
a good time\\
484 - and-and I'll get there\\
485 - just as fast as my little old legs
can pump a bicycle.\\
486 - Good-bye, honey.\\
487 - Silly me.\\
488 - You're never gonna believe this.\\
489 - You know, my passport,\\
490 - I thought was in the trunk in Nice?\\
491 - Well, it wasn't there at all.\\
492 - It was right over there in my
knapsack,\\
493 - so I'll just go get it and give it to
you.\\
494 - Oh, no, no, no, I'm sorry, signora.\\
495 - You can't go through without a
passport.\\
496 - Mamma mia, I just told you it's over
there in my knapsack.\\
497 - Let me go through and I'll get it.\\
498 - No, no, no, no, no, mi dispiace.\\
499 - You cannot go through unless you show
me your passport.\\
500 - Well, how can I show you my passport\\
501 - if you won't let me go through to get
it?\\
502 - Well, I'm sorry, regulation.\\
503 - Regulations, smegulations!\\
504 - All right, it's in my knapsack. You
go get it.\\
505 - Signora, those knapsacks have been
cleared\\
506 - out of Italy and into France\\
507 - and they can only be brought out of
France\\
508 - back in Italy by the owner.\\
509 - But I am the owner!\\
510 - Can you prove it?\\
511 - Of course! What do you want me to do
to prove it?\\
512 - Show me your passport.\\
513 - Mamma mia!\\
514 - May I use your phone?\\
515 - Ma, si, si, si.\\
516 - Thank you very much.\\
517 - Regulations.\\
518 - Sheesh!\\
519 - Operator, I'd like the Plaza Hotel in
Nice, France.\\
520 - Buona fortuna.\\
521 - Operator, I'd like to speak to
Monsieur Ricky Ricardo, please.\\
522 - (sighs)\\
523 - Buona fortuna.\\
524 - What? There's no answer.\\
525 - Well, I...
Please give him this message:\\
526 - Help!\\
527 - Thank you.\\
528 - No, no name.
He'll know who it's from.\\
529 - GUARD: Buona fortuna.\\
530 - Va adagio, adagio, eh?\\
531 - Oh, honey, am I glad to see you!\\
532 - He wouldn't let me go over and get my
passport\\
533 - unless I had a passport,\\
534 - and I, and I couldn't get my passport\\
535 - unless he let me go through to get
it.\\
536 - Honey, I'm sorry.\\
537 - Oh, boy, gee, thanks.\\
538 - Thanks, honey.\\
539 - Va bene.\\
540 - Well, thank you very much.\\
541 - Oh, hooray, I made it!\\
542 - Thank you.\\
543 - Ah, give it to me.
I'll know where it is.\\
544 - Oh.\\
545 - Oh, honey, aren't you gonna to ball
me out or anything?\\
546 - (sighs)\\
547 - Do something to me, please.\\
548 - No, no, I'm afraid to get mad.\\
549 - I'm afraid to get mad for what might
happen if I get mad.\\
550 - But the next time that you get into
trouble...\\
551 - Oh, I won't, sir.
You can trust me, sir.\\
552 - I'll never get in trouble again, sir.\\
553 - If I do, you'll be the last to hear
about it.\\
554 - RICKY: Come on.\\
555 - LUCY: Okay.\\
556 - Get your bicycle.\\
557 - Oh.\\
558 - Hurry up!\\
559 - Your passport, madame.\\
560 - Well, you remember me. I...
I just crossed the border.\\
561 - I just came back to get my bicyc...\\
562 - My, but you've changed.\\
563 - Where's the guard that was just here?\\
564 - He just left.
I came on duty now.\\
565 - Oh, but he knows all about me.\\
566 - You see I had a little...\\
567 - Well... my passport was...\\
568 - We...\\
569 - Oh, it was a mess.
It was a mess.\\
570 - When will he be back?\\

5 - (applause)\\
6 - Honey, it's time to get down for the
dinner show.\\
7 - Ricky?\\
8 - Ricky, do you mind if I don't go to
your show tonight?\\
9 - Don't go?\\
10 - Uh, yeah. The show is wonderful\\
11 - and I just love the numbers you do,\\
12 - but, you know, after seeing it so
many times,\\
13 - it does get a little boring.\\
14 - Do you mind if I don't go tonight?
Ethel and I?\\
15 - No, of course not, honey.
Why should I mind?\\
16 - Good. I-I thought we might go to a
movie.\\
17 - Sure. That's a good idea.\\
18 - Go out, have a little dinner, then go
to a movie,\\
19 - and what do you mean my show is
boring?\\
20 - Oh, well, honey, I didn't mean it was
really boring,\\
21 - but, you know, after seeing it so
many times, it...\\
22 - Well, after 20 or 30 times it does
get a little...\\
23 - Yes?\\
24 - Well, let's put it this way:\\
25 - Your show is so great, I just can't
stand the excitement\\
26 - of seeing it one more time.\\
27 - That's better.\\
28 - Oh.\\
29 - That's better?\\
30 - Hi, Rick.\\
31 - Oh, hi. 		Hi.\\
32 - We'd better get down for the dinner
show, Rick.\\
33 - Yeah, okay, I'll be right with you,
Fred.\\
34 - Hey, Ethel, Ethel, how would you\\
35 - like to have dinner and go to a movie
with me tonight?\\
36 - Oh, I'd love to,\\
37 - but how did you get us out of the,
uh, s-h-o-w?\\
38 - Oh, Ethel, he can't pronounce
English,\\
39 - but he can spell it.\\
40 - You're darn tootin' I can.\\
41 - That's one thing I know how to do is
how to s-p-e-l.\\
42 - I'll get my things.\\
43 - FRED: Hey, Rick, there's something I
want to...\\
44 - Well, I'd better tell you.\\
45 - Yeah, what is it, Fred?\\
46 - Well, I was going over the books and,
uh...\\
47 - Well, you know that money isn't
everything.\\
48 - And you also know that, uh, anyone
can make a mistake.\\
49 - Well, wha-wha-what's going on?\\
50 - You remember how I told you back in
Rome\\
51 - that we'd cleared $3,000.\\
52 - Yeah?\\
53 - Well, I checked the figures again,
and, uh...\\
54 - when I jiggled the paper, uh...\\
55 - for what I thought were decimal
points fell off.\\
56 - Must've been dirt or something.\\
57 - So, we, uh, didn't make quite $3,000.\\
58 - Well, how much did we make?\\
59 - $300.\\
60 - $300?!\\
61 - Fred, when I hire a band manager,\\
62 - I hire somebody to handle things, not
to louse them up.\\
63 - Well, I'm sorry, Rick, but these
things just happen.\\
64 - Well, there's been too many\\
65 - of these dumb things just happening.\\
66 - I might as just as well had Lucy for
a band manager.\\
67 - Well, you don't have to get nasty.\\
68 - What do you mean?\\
69 - What do you mean you might just as
well\\
70 - have had Lucy for a band...\\
71 - And what do you mean," "You don't
have to get nasty"?\\
72 - Never mind.\\
73 - What's going on?\\
74 - Three guesses who goofed.\\
75 - What did I do?!\\
76 - Not you-- Fred, the boy wonder of
Wall Street.\\
77 - Oh.\\
78 - Well, look, we'll have to\\
79 - go over the books tomorrow and see
exactly where we stand.\\
80 - Come on or we'll be late for the
show.\\
81 - Okay.\\
82 - I'll go get my coat.\\
83 - Hey, I got a wonderful idea.\\
84 - Let's you and I go to the Monte Carlo
Casino tonight.\\
85 - Oh, let's do. We couldn't leave\\
86 - without seeing the most famous
gambling casino in the world.\\
87 - And who knows, we might be the first
Americans\\
88 - who ever broke the bank at Monte
Carlo.\\
89 - Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.\\
90 - You're not going to broke no bank
nowhere.\\
91 - Why not? Because I don't want you to
go to the casino.\\
92 - Why not?\\
93 - Because I don't want you to gamble.\\
94 - Oh, honey, just a few dollars. I
might win.\\
95 - That would be worse.\\
96 - Like my father used to say:\\
97 - "El dinero que se gana jugando no
tiene ningun bien.\\
98 - "Y si te encuentro jugando, no puedes
sentar por una semana.\\
99 - Well!\\
100 - What does that mean?\\
101 - It means, "Ill-gotten gold is no
one's gain.\\
102 - "And furthermore, my son, if I catch
you gambling,\\
103 - you won't be able to sit down for a
week."\\
104 - All right, so I won't gamble.\\
105 - I just want to see what the casino
looks like.\\
106 - Ah, no, no, no, no.\\
107 - Once you get in there, the temptation
is irresistible.\\
108 - Oh, how do you know?\\
109 - I know.\\
110 - My father took me to Havana once.\\
111 - So?\\
112 - So I couldn't sit down\\
113 - for a week.\\
114 - Remember, no casino.\\
115 - Why don't you just lock me in my room
for the night?\\
116 - Oh, no, honey, don't be silly.\\
117 - You can go and have dinner anywhere
you want,\\
118 - and then go see a movie.\\
119 - And you stay out of that casino, too,
Ethel.\\
120 - Oh, with the money you give me, you
don't have to worry.\\
121 - It's not that; I'm afraid you might
meet up with some prince\\
122 - and sweep him off his feet.\\
123 - Well, I could. I might, I might.\\
124 - (chuckling): Well, good luck.\\
125 - (door shuts)\\
126 - Dinner and a movie, big deal.\\
127 - Well, so we can't gamble.\\
128 - We can at least eat.\\
129 - Where'll we go?\\
130 - Well, let's see, restaurants,
restaurants...\\
131 - Hey.\\
132 - You know where we're dining tonight?\\
133 - Where?\\
134 - At a very famous\\
135 - Monte Carlo restaurant called "Le
Grille."\\
136 - Is it near the casino?\\
137 - It's in the casino.\\
138 - Lucy, we can't do that.\\
139 - Why not? They said we could eat\\
140 - at anyplace we wanted to, didn't
they?\\
141 - Yeah, but they also said we couldn't
go to the casino.\\
142 - Oh, well, Ethel, if you're gonna
split hairs...\\
143 - Well, I'd rather split hairs\\
144 - than have the boys split our skulls.\\
145 - Look at it this way:\\
146 - How many times in your life are you
going to be in Monte Carlo?\\
147 - Well, I don't know, but...\\
148 - Is it our fault the best restaurant
is in the casino?\\
149 - Well, we don't have to go to that
restaurant.\\
150 - We do if we want to see the casino.\\
151 - In the face of such logic, how can I
refuse?\\
152 - Oh, Ethel, isn't it exciting?\\
153 - Uh, yeah, yeah.\\
154 - Le-let's get out of here.\\
155 - Now, now, we are, we are, we're on
our way out.\\
156 - We're just strolling slowly through
the casino\\
157 - to help digest our food, you know.\\
158 - Les des sont a vous, madame.\\
159 - Huh?\\
160 - It is your dice, madame.\\
161 - Oh, uh, uh, j'ai do not play-ay.\\
162 - Oh, look.\\
163 - Ooh, a chip, huh?\\
164 - Uh...\\
165 - Pardon me, sir, is this your chip?\\
166 - Uh, this must be your chip, then,
sir.\\
167 - No, no, madame.\\
168 - No?\\
169 - (sighing)\\
170 - Il n'y en a plus. Merci.\\
171 - 26 black.\\
172 - Madame, madame.\\
173 - Madame!\\
174 - Number 26 has won.\\
175 - What?\\
176 - Number 26 has won.\\
177 - So?\\
178 - Your number has won.\\
179 - My number won?\\
180 - Yes. Look, all this is yours.\\
181 - Oh, well, that...
there's been a mistake.\\
182 - See, I put the chip on the table,\\
183 - but it wasn't really my chip in the
first place.\\
184 - I-I threw it on a number, but I
didn't mean to.\\
185 - This isn't my money.\\
186 - Look, this isn't my money, sir.\\
187 - The whole stack on number 18, madame?\\
188 - Oh, fine, 18, I don't care.\\
189 - Nombre dix-huit, 18.\\
190 - You have won again.\\
191 - Pardon me.\\
192 - What is your system, madame?\\
193 - System?
I don't have any system.\\
194 - I don't know anything about the game.\\
195 - (laughing)\\
196 - Madame, madame, your money.\\
197 - It is not my money, no, sir.\\
198 - Pardon, madame.\\
199 - It is your money.\\
200 - I saw you placing the bet with my own
eyes.\\
201 - Now, now, look.
Wait just a minute, mister.\\
202 - I... Oh, Ethel.\\
203 - Uh, you saw her put the bet on the
table,\\
204 - but that chip didn't belong to her.\\
205 - The first chip, it was not mine.\\
206 - Oh, very well.\\
207 - Voila, this is for the house.\\
208 - The rest is yours.\\
209 - Pardon, madame,\\
210 - do you wish to place another bet?\\
211 - Now, look, look. Try to get this
through your head.\\
212 - I-I-I wash my hands of those chips.\\
213 - But, madame...\\
214 - As far as I'm concerned,\\
215 - they can stay right where they are, I
don't care.\\
216 - Oh, then you like to try it on the
number 18?\\
217 - Fine, fine.\\
218 - 18 repeats!\\
219 - Ethel, this is terrible.\\
220 - What are they doing to me?\\
221 - Oh, let's just get out of here, huh?\\
222 - Pardon, pardon, pa-pa-pardon, madame.\\
223 - Uh, does madame wish to continue with
the game?\\
224 - I was never in the game.\\
225 - Oh, you do not wish to place another
bet?\\
226 - No, sir. No, sir.\\
227 - Oh, wait, madame,\\
228 - then please follow me to the cashier.\\
229 - The cashier?\\
230 - Ja. you just won 875,000 francs.\\
231 - Look, I-I just couldn't care less.\\
232 - All I was doing was just walking
through the casino.\\
233 - I put-- 875,000 francs!\\
234 - Oui, madame.\\
235 - Ethel!\\
236 - Ethel, come on!\\
237 - Fred?\\
238 - Freddie?\\
239 - Come on in. We're safe.\\
240 - He must have stayed for the late
show.\\
241 - Oh, Ethel, what are we gonna do with
this?\\
242 - Oh, Lucy, we've got to do something.\\
243 - We can't hide it in my room.\\
244 - If Ricky finds it, he'll kill me.\\
245 - Even after he finds out how much you
won?\\
246 - Oh, honey, that would be worse.\\
247 - He'd be a rich widower.\\
248 - Let me hide it in here\\
249 - until I can at least think of some
way to...\\
250 - to tell him without admitting\\
251 - that I went to the casino.\\
252 - Well, all right.
Where'll we put it?\\
253 - How about under the mattress?\\
254 - Oh, no, it'd get mixed up with Fred's
money.\\
255 - I know, I know.\\
256 - I've got it.\\
257 - Right in here with my good lingerie.\\
258 - There's lots of room.
I haven't much good lingerie.\\
259 - Here. Put it under there.\\
260 - It'll be safe there.\\
261 - Gee, French money is big, isn't it?\\
262 - Oh, I never knew it was that big.\\
263 - Who would imagine a thing like this
happening?\\
264 - Come on now.
It's all right.\\
265 - Winning all that money.\\
266 - Ethel, how am I gonna explain all
that money?\\
267 - This is probably the toughest
assignment I've ever had.\\
268 - Well, maybe something will come to
you in the night.\\
269 - Gee, I hope so.\\
270 - Don't tell Fred.\\
271 - Flannelmouth Freddie?\\
272 - I should say not.\\
273 - Okay, and thanks a lot, Ethel.\\
274 - Well, good night.
'Night.\\
275 - Hi.\\
276 - Hi.
Is Fred here?\\
277 - No, he's down in the barbershop.\\
278 - Oh, I'll call him.\\
279 - Barbershop, please.\\
280 - Is Lucy in her room?\\
281 - No. I think she's down in the lobby.\\
282 - Oh, well, maybe I'll run into her.\\
283 - So long, Rick.
Bye.\\
284 - Monsieur Mertz, please.\\
285 - FRED: Hello?\\
286 - Oh, hello, Fred, this is Ricky.\\
287 - I'm up in your room.\\
288 - I came over to go over the books, you
know.\\
289 - I'll be right up.\\
290 - As long as you're there,\\
291 - why don't you get started on the
books?\\
292 - All right. Where are they?\\
293 - They're in my suitcase in the closet.\\
294 - Okay.\\
295 - (whistling)\\
296 - (laughing)\\
297 - Hi, Rick.\\
298 - Hi, Fred.\\
299 - I'm sorry, I...\\
300 - Hey, you got hold of the wrong
suitcase.\\
301 - I'll say I did.\\
302 - That's full of Ethel's
unmentionables.\\
303 - There's a few of yours in here, too.\\
304 - What do you mean?\\
305 - Look, Fred...\\
306 - we've been friends for a long time.\\
307 - Well?\\
308 - I-I-I know there's a logical
explanation.\\
309 - Don't you have something to tell me?\\
310 - Well, no, I don't think so.\\
311 - All right, Fred,\\
312 - if that's the way you want to handle
it.\\
313 - Open the suitcase and explain what's
in it.\\
314 - Well, what are you talking about?\\
315 - Just open the suitcase and explain
what's in it.\\
316 - Well, all right.\\
317 - This is Ethel's girdle.\\
318 - (whistles)
This is what I mean.\\
319 - Holy smoke! Where did that bundle of
cabbage come from?\\
320 - That's what I'd like to know.\\
321 - Huh?\\
322 - What's the story?\\
323 - What's what story?\\
324 - Now, look, Fred...\\
325 - Yeah?\\
326 - Yesterday, you told me\\
327 - that you made a mistake in
bookkeeping in Rome.\\
328 - Uh-huh.\\
329 - That we hadn't made $3,000,\\
330 - that we've only made $300.\\
331 - That we were short $2,700.\\
332 - And today I find a suitcase full of
money in your closet.\\
333 - Are you trying to tell me\\
334 - you think I've been juggling the
books?\\
335 - Fred, I am trying to find out a
logical explanation.\\
336 - Now, after all, you...\\
337 - you have almost a million francs in
this suitcase,\\
338 - and you say you don't know where it
comes from, huh!\\
339 - Well, in the first place,\\
340 - it isn't my suitcase, it's Ethel's.\\
341 - Please, now, don't be a cad and pin
it on your wife!\\
342 - Now, where did this money come from?\\
343 - I tell you, I don't know!\\
344 - Now, Fred,\\
345 - I am afraid I have caught you
red-handed.\\
346 - You have not caught me red-handed,\\
347 - you Cuban mush-mouth.\\
348 - Fred...\\
349 - I am trying to be fair.\\
350 - Don't make me lose my temper.\\
351 - Oh, go ahead and lose it.\\
352 - I've already lost mine.\\
353 - Now, put up your dukes!\\
354 - Fred...\\
355 - Go on, put 'em up.\\
356 - I'm gonna thrash you within an inch
of your life.\\
357 - Fred, I am not gonna get into a fight
with you.\\
358 - Oh, yes, you are. You've sullied the
name of Mertz.\\
359 - Now, come on.\\
360 - Fred.\\
361 - Fred!\\
362 - Fred!\\
363 - Es una cosa horrible que paso!\\
364 - No lo puedo creer!
No lo puedo creer!\\
365 - I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!\\
366 - It's not you.
This time it's Fred.\\
367 - Oh.
Fred Mertz.\\
368 - You know what he's been doing?\\
369 - What?	     He's been juggling the
books.\\
370 - Fred Mertz is an embezzler.\\
371 - Not our Fred Mertz.\\
372 - Yes, our Fred Mertz.\\
373 - Oh, honey, that...
that can't be true.\\
374 - You must be mistaken.\\
375 - No, no, no, I'm not mistaken.\\
376 - Accidentally I found a suitcase full
of money in his closet.\\
377 - And he says he has no idea\\
378 - where that money came from. Huh!\\
379 - Oh, uh...\\
380 - Uh, Ricky, that isn't Fred's money in
Ethel's suitcase.\\
381 - What do you mean it isn't Fred's...\\
382 - How did you know it was Ethel's
suitcase?\\
383 - Oh... uh, how did I know it was
Ethel's suitcase?\\
384 - Yeah?\\
385 - Was Ethel there?\\
386 - No.\\
387 - Well, then, uh...\\
388 - she told me it was her money.\\
389 - Where did Ethel get all that money?\\
390 - Her aunt died and left it to her.\\
391 - Her aunt left her French money?\\
392 - Oh.\\
393 - It was her French aunt.\\
394 - That's good.\\
395 - I mean, that's right.\\
396 - Her French aunt, her aunt Yvette.\\
397 - Yeah, Yvette.\\
398 - Are you telling me the truth?\\
399 - If I'm not, may I drop dead.\\
400 - Why didn't Fred say something about
it?\\
401 - He didn't know.\\
402 - He didn't know?\\
403 - No, no, you know how tight Fred is.\\
404 - Uh, Ethel didn't want that old
rooster\\
405 - to know about her nest egg.\\
406 - Boy, if... if what you're saying is
right,\\
407 - I certainly owe Fred Mertz an
apology.\\
408 - Yeah, well...\\
409 - (door slamming)\\
410 - There it is, Ricardo.\\
411 - My resignation.\\
412 - Effective immediately.\\
413 - Immediately after you pay our
transportation\\
414 - back to the States,\\
415 - plus two weeks severance pay.\\
416 - Now, Fred...\\
417 - Fred.\\
418 - I-I'm afraid I owe you an apology.\\
419 - I just found out\\
420 - that that money belongs to Ethel.\\
421 - Ethel who?\\
422 - Ethel Mertz.\\
423 - My Ethel Mertz?\\
424 - Yes.\\
425 - Her aunt died and left her the money.\\
426 - What aunt?\\
427 - A... A French aunt that you don't
know about.\\
428 - That's right, Fred.\\
429 - Do you mean my little honeybun is
loaded?\\
430 - Yeah.\\
431 - Gee, Fred, I'm, I'm...\\
432 - I'm sorry I thought you were a crook.\\
433 - That's all right, Rick, what are
friends for?\\
434 - Listen, we'll tear this up, huh?\\
435 - All right.\\
436 - Fred... Fred, uh,\\
437 - don't tell Ethel you know.\\
438 - Let her tell you in her own way, huh?\\
439 - Yeah, that-that'd be better, Fred.\\
440 - Sure, sure.	Don't say that we
told you.\\
441 - I know what you mean.\\
442 - Oh, there you are!\\
443 - It was so hot out,\\
444 - I had to come right back.\\
445 - I've never seen, uh, uh...\\
446 - What are you looking so funny about?\\
447 - Hello, there, you little dickens,
you!\\
448 - What's the matter with you?\\
449 - Sweetheart, it just dawned on me\\
450 - what a fascinating creature you are.\\
451 - The heat's got him.\\
452 - No, no, no, don't be silly.\\
453 - It's you, you doll.\\
454 - Why, when you walked into this room,\\
455 - if we weren't already married, I'd
have asked you for a date.\\
456 - Come on, honey, let's try and go
someplace\\
457 - where we can be alone.\\
458 - Come on, darling,\\
459 - come on.\\
460 - Let's try and be alone for a minute.\\
461 - Come on, I'll sit here.\\
462 - You sit in my lap.\\
463 - Come on, sweetie pie.\\
464 - Now, now, put your arm around me.\\
465 - There.\\
466 - Fred, are you sure you're all right?\\
467 - I never felt better in my life,
lover.\\
468 - Oh, then you meant all those things\\
469 - you said in there?\\
470 - 'Course I did.\\
471 - Oh, you are cute.\\
472 - (phone rings)\\
473 - (laughs giddily)\\
474 - Hello.\\
475 - Hello. Ethel, it's me.\\
476 - Uh, call back later, dear.\\
477 - Now, where were we?\\
478 - (phone rings)\\
479 - Oh...\\
480 - Hello?\\
481 - Ethel, listen to me now.\\
482 - Ricky's going downstairs.\\
483 - It's my only chance to talk to you.\\
484 - Ricky found all that money in your
suitcase\\
485 - and thought Fred had been juggling
the books,\\
486 - so I told him it was your money.\\
487 - What'd you do that for?\\
488 - Well, I didn't want him to think Fred
was an embezzler\\
489 - and I didn't want him to find out I'd
been gambling\\
490 - and you were the only one left.
I ran out of people.\\
491 - Well, you've run out of friends, too.\\
492 - That's the dirtiest trick you've ever
played on me!\\
493 - I never want to see you again!\\
494 - (phone clicks)
Oh, but now...\\
495 - Who was that, snookums?\\
496 - Aah, you let me up.\\
497 - No, now, tootsie...\\
498 - I just found out why you're
tootsieing me.\\
499 - It's on account of that money in my
suitcase.\\
500 - Money? That money had nothing\\
501 - to do with my deep devotion for you.\\
502 - Well, it's a good thing it didn't\\
503 - because it isn't mine, it's Lucy's.\\
504 - Lucy's?!\\
505 - She won it last night gambling at the
casino.\\
506 - What are you trying to pull?\\
507 - I'm not trying to pull anything.\\
508 - It was Lucy's half-baked idea.\\
509 - Ethel, I'm sorry. I'm sorry!\\
510 - You're sorry?
How do you think I feel?\\
511 - Lucy, you and I are through.\\
512 - Oh, now, Ethel, listen...\\
513 - And don't you say anything, you
golddigger.\\
514 - Don't you call me a gold digger, you
pauper!\\
515 - Oh, now, Ricky was right.\\
516 - Ill-gotten gold is nobody's gain.\\
517 - Look at us, at each other's throats\\
518 - just because of that dirty money.\\
519 - This dirty old money!\\
520 - Lucy, what are you gonna do?\\
521 - Lucy! Where are you gonna go?\\
522 - I'm going back to the casino\\
523 - and get rid of this ill-gotten gold!\\
524 - (groaning)\\
525 - Now, what's the matter with you?\\
526 - Wiped out twice in one lifetime.\\
527 - What do you mean?\\
528 - The crash of '29 and now this.\\
529 - Fred!\\
530 - Hi.\\
531 - What's the matter?
What's going on?\\
532 - What's the matter with Fred?\\
533 - He just found out I'm not Bobo
Rockefeller.\\
534 - What are you talking about?\\
535 - The money in that suitcase isn't
mine, it's Lucy's.\\
536 - Oh.\\
537 - Lucy's!\\
538 - Yeah, she won it gambling last night
at the casino.\\
539 - I told her not to gamble!\\
540 - Oh, now, put your eyes back in their
sockets.\\
541 - She only gambled by accident.\\
542 - By accident?\\
543 - Oh, come now, there was almost a
million francs in that suitcase.\\
544 - You can think of a better story than
that.\\
545 - Oh, now, Ricky, it's the truth.\\
546 - It's the truth. She found a chip on
the floor\\
547 - and she threw it on the table to give
it back and it won.\\
548 - She kept pushing the chips,\\
549 - just kept pushing them away from her\\
550 - and she pushed her way into a
fortune.\\
551 - Oh.\\
552 - Now, Rick, she kept her promise,\\
553 - honest she did.\\
554 - We just happened to eat in a
restaurant\\
555 - that was in the casino.\\
556 - You told her she could eat anyplace
she wanted to.\\
557 - Ricky, please don't be angry.\\
558 - (chuckling)\\
559 - I'm not angry.\\
560 - You're not?\\
561 - I think it's wonderful.\\
562 - You do?\\
563 - Gee, Lucy thought you'd be furious.\\
564 - Of course not, it wasn't her fault.\\
565 - No, it wasn't.
Not her fault.\\
566 - No.\\
567 - Where is she?\\
568 - She's gone to the casino to give back
the money!\\
569 - Oh, no!
Yeah.\\
570 - (yells)\\
571 - There, and I never want to see it
again.\\
572 - One moment, madame.\\
573 - You don't know, you don't know\\
574 - what has happened to me with that
money.\\
575 - I-I put one chip on this table
yesterday and-and it...\\
576 - and it... money like that that I
don't...\\
577 - Here are your chips, madame.\\
578 - I do not want the chips, I wash my
hands.\\
579 - Vingt-cinq. 25.\\
580 - Wait, madame, you have won again.\\
581 - That is impossible\\
582 - because I did not put my chips on any
number.\\
583 - I know, madame, but you had them on
red.\\
584 - And 25 is red.\\
585 - Oh, no.\\
586 - Lucy!\\
587 - Ricky, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't
mean it.\\
588 - I didn't mean it...
Look, look, honey,\\
589 - Ethel explained everything to me,\\
590 - and I think it's wonderful.\\
591 - You mean I can keep it?\\
592 - Sure. Where's the money?\\
593 - 22.
Right there.\\
594 - Oh, no!\\
595 - (wailing)\\

4 - ANNOUNCER: And now, "I Love Lucy."\\
5 - (applause)\\
6 - Lucy, have you got room for this
stuff in your trunk?\\
7 - I was just coming down to ask you the
same thing.\\
8 - Ethel, I told you, you were buying
too many souvenirs.\\
9 - Well, now, I want a lot of things\\
10 - to remind me of my trip when I get
home.\\
11 - Gee, I hate to leave Europe.\\
12 - Me, too.\\
13 - From the looks of things, you're not
leaving it.\\
14 - You're taking it with you.\\
15 - Oh, Fred, you can't come home from
Europe\\
16 - without buying gifts for your
friends.\\
17 - The test of true friendship\\
18 - does not depend upon buying gifts.\\
19 - He ought to know--\\
20 - he's been testing his friends for 20
years.\\
21 - Look at all this junk you're lugging
home.\\
22 - This is not junk, Fred, believe me.\\
23 - Hi, Rick.
Come here.	Hi, Ricky.\\
24 - Hi, honey.    Hi, dear.\\
25 - Listen, I stopped by American 'Spress\\
26 - and I gave them our forwarding
address in New York.\\
27 - Hey, did they have any mail Good.     \\
28 - for us at American 'Spress?\\
29 - Oh, yes, I almost forgot. Here.\\
30 - Oh, a letter from Mother!\\
31 - Gee, it'll be wonderful to see Mother\\
32 - and Little Ricky again, won't it,
honey?\\
33 - Yeah, it'll be wonderful to see
Little Ricky again all right.\\
34 - Here's a telegram for you.\\
35 - How do you like that?
A telegram\\
36 - and she forwards it in the regular
mail.\\
37 - It takes three weeks to get here.\\
38 - Only your mother would...\\
39 - Oh, now, honey, maybe it isn't
important.\\
40 - It's probably a birthday greeting or
something.\\
41 - I hope you're right.\\
42 - que estaba esperando.\\
43 - What's it say?\\
44 - Oh, no! Lo estoy esperando por tres
meses el telegram...\\
45 - FRED: What's it say?\\
46 - Well, whatever it is,\\
47 - I have a feeling it isn't "happy
birthday."\\
48 - Your mother is a... a...\\
49 - Honey, is it important?\\
50 - Oh, no, no.\\
51 - Only the managing director of the
Roxy Theater in New York,\\
52 - and he wants me to open there with my
band for two weeks,\\
53 - starting next Monday!
That's all.\\
54 - Oh...\\
55 - We'll make it if fly.\\
56 - That's a good idea.
I'll call him\\
57 - and find out if the offer still
stands.\\
58 - All right.\\
59 - Hello, operator.\\
60 - Operator, I want to put a call to New
York City, please.\\
61 - Mr. Rothefel at the Roxy Theater in
New York City.\\
62 - As soon as you can.
It's very important.\\
63 - Listen, Fred, would you see if you
can get a reservation\\
64 - on Pan American for us and the
orchestra?\\
65 - Sure I will.\\
66 - Hey, this is exciting.\\
67 - We're gonna fly across the ocean.\\
68 - Who said you were going to?\\
69 - What do you mean?\\
70 - I may leave you right here in Europe.\\
71 - I didn't do anything.\\
72 - Your mother did, and she inherits it
from you.\\
73 - Oh!\\
74 - Hello.\\
75 - Yes? Yes.\\
76 - Mr. Rothefel?\\
77 - This is Ricky Ricardo.\\
78 - Ye-Yes, sir. I'm still...
I'm still in Europe.\\
79 - I got your wire.
Well, I just got it today.\\
80 - Well, I-I know when it was sent,\\
81 - but it went to my personal dead
letter office.\\
82 - Oh, push tush.\\
83 - Well, it doesn't matter. Look, I just
wanted to find out:\\
84 - Does the offer stand?\\
85 - Wonderful.\\
86 - Yeah, well, I'm just trying to find
out if I can fly.\\
87 - Yeah, you'll make it, Peter Pan.\\
88 - I'll let you know...
Oh, hold it a minute.\\
89 - Hey, it's all set, Rick.\\
90 - There's a clipper leaving tomorrow
afternoon,\\
91 - arriving New York the following day.\\
92 - Wonderful. Listen, it's all right.\\
93 - We-we're gonna be able to fly\\
94 - and we'll be there in plenty of time.\\
95 - Yes. Thank you very much.\\
96 - Good-bye. Good.\\
97 - Now listen. Wait a minute.\\
98 - You'd better call the steamship lines\\
99 - and tell them that we have to go by
plane.\\
100 - All right.\\
101 - You see, everything's all right.\\
102 - Mother didn't make such a bad mistake
after all.\\
103 - Hey, Rick, I'm just thinking.\\
104 - The band was going home free for
playing on the boat.\\
105 - This way, you'll have to buy plane
tickets for all of us.\\
106 - Oh, who asked you?\\
107 - Thanks to your mother,\\
108 - I have to play the Roxy for two weeks
for nothing.\\
109 - All right, forget about the Roxy.\\
110 - Let's go home on the boat like we
planned.\\
111 - Oh, no. No, no.\\
112 - I've been waiting to play the Roxy
for a long time,\\
113 - and I'm gonna play the Roxy.\\
114 - Oh, ho! You see? It isn't my mother's
fault at all.\\
115 - It's just your neurotic need to be in
the spotlight.\\
116 - My neurotic need to be in the
spotlight?\\
117 - Yeah. How do you like them apples?\\
118 - And close your mouth.\\
119 - What apples?\\
120 - I hope that's a big plane we're going
home on.\\
121 - Got to have plenty of room for all
this stuff.\\
122 - Oh, no, you dunt.\\
123 - What "dunt" I "dunt?"\\
124 - You don't take this junk on the
plane.\\
125 - That's what you don't dunt.\\
126 - Why not?\\
127 - Look, they only allow you 66 pounds,\\
128 - and every pound over 66 costs you two
dollars.\\
129 - Two dollars a pound?
That's right.\\
130 - Everything over 66 pounds has to go
by boat.\\
131 - (sighing): Well, all right.
Let's see.\\
132 - Oh, dear, now, I've got to take these
wooden shoes\\
133 - to Marian Van Black.\\
134 - And I got to take this bottle\\
135 - of My Sin to Mrs. Trumbull, I
promised her.\\
136 - Oh, here's something you can ship.\\
137 - That probably weighs all of two
ounces.\\
138 - Well, I don't care.\\
139 - These other things are very
important.\\
140 - Look, Lucy, make up your mind, that
everything goes by boat\\
141 - except your luggage and your clothes.\\
142 - That alone will weigh 66 pounds.\\
143 - All right, but there's one thing\\
144 - I have to take with me for sure--
that cheese.\\
145 - That cheese?\\
146 - Yes. Now, don't argue with me.\\
147 - You can't get that kind of cheese at
home.\\
148 - Are you kidding?\\
149 - This thing must weigh 66 pounds by
itself.\\
150 - No, it's only 25 pounds.\\
151 - That's a very rare kind of Italian
cheese\\
152 - and I promised to bring it home for a
very special person.\\
153 - And who is this very special person?\\
154 - Someone we all know and love--\\
155 - my mother.\\
156 - Your what?!\\
157 - My mother, and she's a who, not a
what.\\
158 - Now, look, Lucy, your mother has
already cost me a fortune.\\
159 - And I'm not going to spend one more
penny\\
160 - on that big hunk of cheese.\\
161 - How can we get off that plane\\
162 - and not have a present for mother?\\
163 - After all, she stayed with the baby\\
164 - all the time we were gone.\\
165 - For the money she's cost me, I could
have hired Dr. Spock.\\
166 - Oh...\\
167 - Now, look, I don't want to hear
another argument about it.\\
168 - I'm not going to spend one more penny
for this cheese\\
169 - even to ship it.\\
170 - Now, come on, Fred.\\
171 - We've got a lot of things to do.\\
172 - Okay.\\
173 - Boy, there's going to be some family
argument\\
174 - if I get off that plane without a
present for my mother.\\
175 - How can I get that cheese to New
York?\\
176 - You can't.\\
177 - Oh, yes, I can, now.\\
178 - Ricky won't pay for taking it...\\
179 - What do, what do they take on the
plane for free?\\
180 - Only the clothes you're wearing.\\
181 - Oh, well, that's no good.\\
182 - Very few people wear cheese.\\
183 - Try to think of something else
besides clothes.\\
184 - You thinking?\\
185 - Y-Yes. I'm, I'm thinking.
Yeah, I'm thinking.\\
186 - Do they charge for babies on planes?\\
187 - I don't think so. Why?\\
188 - Oh, no.\\
189 - Lucy, oh, no, Lucy.\\
190 - Isn't that cute?\\
191 - Yeah.\\
192 - Gee, that'll come in handy, won't it?\\
193 - Hi.\\
194 - Hi, boys.\\
195 - Hi, Rick.\\
196 - Where's Lucy?\\
197 - Oh, uh, uh, she stopped to get a
magazine.\\
198 - She'll be here in a minute.\\
199 - How much time do we have?\\
200 - We take off in five minutes.\\
201 - Thank you.\\
202 - If Lucy misses this plane...\\
203 - Now, Rick, she'll make it.\\
204 - Five will get you ten.\\
205 - Don't worry, Rick.\\
206 - Sit down.
She'll make it.\\
207 - Yeah, well...\\
208 - Oh, here she comes.\\
209 - I told you, she'd make it.\\
210 - What's she...\\
211 - What's that?\\
212 - What's what?\\
213 - That. What are you doing?\\
214 - Oh, Rock-a-bye, baby...\\
215 - What have you got there?\\
216 - Where are you going?\\
217 - I am not the father of that cheese.\\
218 - Oh... come on, sit down.
Sit down here.\\
219 - Look...
Sit down!\\
220 - I don't want anything to do with you
or your little scheme.\\
221 - I will be sitting in the lounge\\
222 - in the back of the plane.\\
223 - Oh, Ricky.
Fred.\\
224 - I thought I'd sit up here with you\\
225 - so we wouldn't disturb the others.\\
226 - WOMAN (over P.A.): Good afternoon.\\
227 - All of us are happy to have you
aboard\\
228 - this Pan American President flight
number 155 to New York.\\
229 - Fasten your seat belts, please,\\
230 - and observe the "No Smoking" sign.\\
231 - Thank you.\\
232 - I'm Evelyn Bigsby.\\
233 - Oh, I'm, uh...
How do you do?\\
234 - I'm Lucy Ricardo.\\
235 - How do you do?\\
236 - (baby crying)\\
237 - No, no.\\
238 - She's a little fussy.
She missed her nap.\\
239 - Oh.\\
240 - My, you certainly have a quiet baby.
Good baby.\\
241 - Yeah, well...\\
242 - Is it a girl?\\
243 - Huh?\\
244 - Is it a girl?\\
245 - No.\\
246 - Oh, a boy.\\
247 - All right.\\
248 - Mine's a girl.\\
249 - Oh.\\
250 - She's four months old.\\
251 - Hmm.\\
252 - How old is yours?\\
253 - Uh... four months.\\
254 - Oh, big baby.\\
255 - How much does he weigh?\\
256 - 25 pounds.\\
257 - 25 pounds at four months?\\
258 - Too much?\\
259 - Well, how much did he weigh when he
was born?\\
260 - Uh...fif... uh...\\
261 - Eight pounds.\\
262 - But he's a big eater.\\
263 - Well, I think I'll take a nap.\\
264 - I'm just dying to see him.\\
265 - What's his name?\\
266 - Cheddar...\\
267 - Uh, Chester.\\
268 - My daughter's name's Caroline.\\
269 - Oh, well, that's nice.\\
270 - Especially for a girl.\\
271 - Isn't she cute?\\
272 - Yeah.\\
273 - May I?\\
274 - Oh, no, he's...
he's very shy.\\
275 - He doesn't like to have strangers
look at him.\\
276 - Do you want the strange lady to see
you?\\
277 - You don't? Oh, well, don't worry
about it. No.\\
278 - No, no, it's perfectly all right.\\
279 - No, I'll just tell her, that's all.
Forget about it.\\
280 - He said no.\\
281 - He talks?\\
282 - Only the last couple of months.\\
283 - If you ladies will give me the
babies' bottles,\\
284 - I'll heat them.\\
285 - Oh, fine, yes.
Thank you.\\
286 - There you are.\\
287 - Wouldn't you like me to warm your
baby's bottle?\\
288 - Oh, well, he isn't hungry yet. Thank
you.\\
289 - Well, then, let me keep it in the
refrigerator it for you.\\
290 - Oh, okay... oh.\\
291 - Uh... I didn't bring any.\\
292 - You didn't bring any?
You didn't bring any?\\
293 - Oh, well, I meant to, really.
I-I just forgot.\\
294 - So, just skip it.\\
295 - He can have one of mine.\\
296 - Oh, no, I wouldn't think of it.
Thank you just the same.\\
297 - I'll, I'll feed him when we get to
New York.\\
298 - But we don't get there until
tomorrow.\\
299 - Oh, well, it will do him good.\\
300 - He's too fat anyway.\\
301 - Please heat both bottles, Miss.\\
302 - Thank you very much.\\
303 - Oh, hi, dear.\\
304 - Oh, is that your husband?
Yes.\\
305 - Oh, pardon me, sir.\\
306 - Wouldn't you like to sit next to your
wife?\\
307 - I'd be glad to change seats with you.\\
308 - Yes, come on, dear, sit here.\\
309 - Not while you have that.\\
310 - He can't stand children.\\
311 - Oh, well, that's a shame.\\
312 - Yes, it is,\\
313 - especially when the baby looks
exactly like him.\\
314 - Here we are.\\
315 - Oh, good.\\
316 - Oh, thank you.\\
317 - You know, this is a wonderful
formula.\\
318 - It's been in the family for years.\\
319 - Is that so?\\
320 - Mmm. Here we go, honey.\\
321 - (clicking tongue)\\
322 - Good baby.\\
323 - Yes, you're a good baby.\\
324 - Drink it all up.\\
325 - That's a boy.
Down the hatch.\\
326 - Now, here we go.\\
327 - (chuckling)\\
328 - He hates to drink alone.\\
329 - What's in that formula?\\
330 - Cod liver oil.\\
331 - I... I think he's had enough.
Thank you very much.\\
332 - Well he hasn't had any at all.\\
333 - Oh, no, he's had plenty, really.\\
334 - He wasn't very hungry.\\
335 - Burp.\\
336 - Burp.\\
337 - Mrs. Ricardo?\\
338 - Burp. Yes?\\
339 - I've been checking my list\\
340 - and there seems to be a mistake.\\
341 - Oh?\\
342 - I don't have a record of your baby on
our passenger list.\\
343 - Oh, that. Well, I didn't mention it\\
344 - because I-I didn't think it mattered\\
345 - as long as babies travel for free.\\
346 - Oh, but they don't on overseas
flights.\\
347 - Oh.\\
348 - We do charge, but we charge only ten
percent\\
349 - of the regular fare for babies.\\
350 - Oh.\\
351 - You can pay for the baby when you get
to New York.\\
352 - (whispering): Ethel, wake up.
Ethel, wake up.\\
353 - Fred, Fred, stop. Don't pull all the
covers.\\
354 - What's the matter?
Wake up.      Huh, what?\\
355 - What's the matter?
Complications.\\
356 - Complications.
What's the matter?\\
357 - They charge ten percent of the
regular fare for babies.\\
358 - That's $30.\\
359 - Oh, well, how much will it cost for
the cheese?\\
360 - Fifty dollars.\\
361 - Well, it's cheaper to have the cheese
be a baby\\
362 - than have the baby be a cheese.\\
363 - That's not the point.\\
364 - Either way, Ricky will kill me.\\
365 - But what are you gonna do, honey?\\
366 - I'll be back.\\
367 - Where are you going? Ooh...!\\
368 - I'm going to the kitchen.\\
369 - Okay.\\
370 - Ethel, wake up.
What, what?\\
371 - Move over.\\
372 - What are we gonna do, Lucy?\\
373 - What are we gonna do?\\
374 - We're gonna eat it.\\
375 - What?!\\
376 - We're gonna eat the cheese.\\
377 - You like cheese, don't you?\\
378 - Oh, well, not enough to eat all of
that.\\
379 - Oh, come on now.\\
380 - Oh, Lucy, I couldn't eat 25 pounds of
cheese.\\
381 - I-I polished off a wonderful meal.\\
382 - I-I ate a-a nice, great, big steak\\
383 - and-and some apricot pie...\\
384 - Hey, stop talking and eat. Here.\\
385 - Oh, Lucy, this is ridiculous.\\
386 - Even I can't eat all of this.\\
387 - Eat what you can.\\
388 - We'll figure out what to do with the
rest later.\\
389 - (contented sigh)\\
390 - Where's your baby?\\
391 - Huh?\\
392 - Your baby-- where is he?\\
393 - Oh, that.\\
394 - (chuckling): Oh, I didn't have a
baby.\\
395 - (laughing)\\
396 - What do you mean, you didn't have a
baby?\\
397 - I didn't.
I didn't have a baby.\\
398 - It was a piece of cheese.\\
399 - (screams)\\
400 - Stewardess!\\
401 - Mrs. Bigsby...
Stewardess!\\
402 - Help!
Mrs. Bigsby...\\
403 - What's the matter?\\
404 - This woman's baby's disappeared\\
405 - and now she claims she never had one.\\
406 - No, no, no, no, no, no, that's not
true.\\
407 - What's the matter?
I saw your baby.\\
408 - No, you did not.\\
409 - (all talking over each other)\\
410 - I've been with this department a good
many years,\\
411 - but I've never seen a case like this.\\
412 - Now, Mrs. Bigsby claims that\\
413 - Mrs. Ricardo had an object in her
arms,\\
414 - and that that object was a baby.\\
415 - I don't claim; I saw.\\
416 - Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!\\
417 - You have no idea what you saw.\\
418 - Mrs. Ricardo says it was not a baby.\\
419 - So far, this is logical.\\
420 - There's a difference of opinion.\\
421 - One lady is right,\\
422 - the other's wrong.\\
423 - Yeah, well.\\
424 - Mr. Ricardo, a celebrated and
seemingly rational man,\\
425 - says that it looked like a baby,\\
426 - but it was in reality a piece of
cheese.\\
427 - That's right.\\
428 - Yeah.\\
429 - Now, Mrs. Ricardo,\\
430 - I'm going to ask you once more:\\
431 - Was there a baby?\\
432 - No, sir.\\
433 - Then whose is this?\\
434 - Oh...\\
435 - It's mine.\\
436 - It's the latest thing from Paris.\\
437 - Now, look, mister, mister...\\
438 - the newsreel fellow is there.\\
439 - He wants to take a picture of me and
my orchestra.\\
440 - Oh, he does?\\
441 - Yes, sir. Now, uh, you see,\\
442 - th-they're getting awfully close to
the deadline.\\
443 - Oh, they are?\\
444 - Well, I thought you'd like to know.\\
445 - Yeah.\\
446 - I beg your pardon, sir, but I am
positive\\
447 - Mrs. Ricardo was carrying a baby.\\
448 - Oh, no you're not, you're not
positive about a thing.\\
449 - Ma'am, please.\\
450 - I saw the baby drinking the milk.\\
451 - (shouting): Wait a minute!\\
452 - Did you actually see the baby's face?\\
453 - I most certainly.\\
454 - RICKY: Oh, come now.\\
455 - You couldn't miss It.\\
456 - It looked just like him.\\
457 - What do you mean, it looked just like
me?\\
458 - You leave him out of it.\\
459 - He had nothing to do with it.\\
460 - It was a baby.\\
461 - It was a piece of cheese.\\
462 - Did you ever hear a piece of cheese
burp?\\
463 - Oh...\\
464 - Look, let me try to explain\\
465 - this whole thing to you from the
beginning.\\
466 - We were in Nice.\\
467 - She wanted to bring this cheese to
her mother.\\
468 - All right, now, I had been telling
her\\
469 - she had too much luggage already.\\
470 - So, she thought that babies travel
for free.\\
471 - She took the cheese,\\
472 - she put a blanket around it,\\
473 - put the little bonnet on the cheese\\
474 - and took it in the plane with her.\\
475 - Well, didn't you think this was
rather strange behavior?\\
476 - For Lucy? No.\\
477 - You see, I intended to pay for the
cheese\\
478 - the minute I got here.\\
479 - Oh, you did?
I did.\\
480 - That's right.
He told me he was.\\
481 - RICKY: Sure.
Hey, Rick, we're gonna\\
482 - miss out on those newsreels.\\
483 - Yeah, get your instruments out...\\
484 - You don't mind if they start
getting...\\
485 - Well, yes, oh, all right, but just
one question.\\
486 - Where is the cheese?\\
487 - That's a good question.\\
488 - Where is the cheese, honey?\\
489 - Uh, where is the cheese?\\
490 - Yes, where is the cheese?\\
491 - ETHEL: We ate it.\\
492 - You and Mrs. Ricardo ate 25 pounds of
cheese?\\
493 - Oh, come now.\\
494 - Oh, it's possible.\\
495 - I've seen my wife sit down and polish
off a whole...\\
496 - Oh, shut up.\\
497 - Lucy, where is the cheese?\\
498 - Well?\\
499 - Well, I'm afraid to tell you.\\
500 - I am not going to do anything to you.\\
501 - You promise?\\
502 - (shouting): I am not going to do...!\\
503 - (wailing)\\
504 - You scared me!\\
505 - I'm sorry.\\
506 - Look, I'll be glad to pay for the
cheese, honey.\\
507 - Well, that's not what I'm afraid of.\\
508 - Well, tell me what it is.\\
509 - Pardon me, Mr. Ricardo.
Yes, sir.\\
510 - We've just got two minutes\\
511 - and I've got to get that shot.\\
512 - All right. Would you excuse...
Let me take this, please.\\
513 - It's very important.
Oh, go ahead.\\
514 - We're working at the Roxy.
The one that you see...\\
515 - Mr. Ricardo, right over here.\\
516 - You stand right over here in front of
the band.\\
517 - Yes, sir.
I'll ask you\\
518 - if you're glad to be home\\
519 - and you answer by playing "Home Sweet
Home."\\
520 - Thank you.
Roll it, Vic.\\
521 - All right, boys, "Home Sweet Home.\\
522 - Everybody together.\\
523 - Mr. Ricardo, how does it feel\\
524 - to be back in the United States?\\
525 - (silence)\\
526 - What's the matter?\\
527 - Oh, no!\\
528 - CUSTOMS AGENT: So that's where you
hid the cheese!\\
529 - Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry\\
530 - I didn't know it'd get all gooey and
everything like that.\\
531 - You don't know how much trouble it
was\\
532 - to get rid of that cheese.\\
533 - I just had to get that cheese home to
my mother, honey.\\
534 - Oh, all I could think of was to put
it in there.\\
535 - I put it in the trombone-- that
wasn't bad--\\
536 - but that piccolo... I thought I'd
never get it in the piccolo.\\
537 - If you'd only had a tuba in the band,\\
538 - I could've put the whole thing in the
tuba.\\
539 - I'm terribly sorry, honey, but I
didn't know what else to do.\\
540 - It'd have meant a lot to me to take
a...\\
541 - You're laughing.
I thought you'd be angry.\\
542 - What are you laughing at?\\
543 - (laughing): It's so ridiculous.\\
544 - The whole thing is so utterly
ridiculous.\\
545 - It is? Yeah, I guess so.\\
546 - It could only happen to you.\\
547 - Yeah, little old silly me.\\
548 - (exaggerated laugh)\\
549 - You know something, Lucy?\\
550 - What?\\
551 - Being married to you is not easy.\\
552 - No.\\
553 - But it sure is a lot of fun.\\
554 - Oh, honey!\\
555 - Mmm...\\
556 - Come on, let's go home and see the
baby, huh?\\
557 - All right, honey.\\

\subsection {Episode 01: Lucy & Bob Hope (1956)}
1 - Come on now, Little Ricky,\\
2 - let me see you swing that bat.\\
3 - Attaboy! Ha-ha!\\
4 - You're gonna be another Mickey
Mantle.\\
5 - Uncle Fred, who's Mickey Mantle?\\
6 - Who's Mickey Mantle?\\
7 - Why, he's the guy\\
8 - they got to replace Joe DiMaggio.\\
9 - Who's Joe Maggio?\\
10 - "Who's Joe Maggio?"\\
11 - You talk more like your father every
day.\\
12 - It's Joe DiMaggio.\\
13 - And he's one of the greatest Yankees
of all time.\\
14 - Come on now, let me see you take
another swipe\\
15 - at that old apple.\\
16 - Boffo!\\
17 - Right out of the park. Attaboy.\\
18 - Hi, Daddy.\\
19 - Hey! Hi!
Hi, Rick.\\
20 - Say, what's going on, partner?\\
21 - I'm swiping apples.\\
22 - You're swiping apples?\\
23 - He means he's taking a swipe at the
old apple.\\
24 - Oh. Well, let me see you do it. Go
on.\\
25 - Show him. Show your dad. At 'em!\\
26 - Hey!\\
27 - He's gonna be another Joe Maggio.\\
28 - Yes, sir.\\
29 - I'm treating the two girls and Little
Ricky\\
30 - to the ball game this afternoon at
Yankee Stadium.\\
31 - Well, that's very generous of you,
Uncle Fred.\\
32 - Well, it's nothing, Rick.
I'm glad to do it.\\
33 - Today is Ladies' Day, Daddy.\\
34 - Oh, it's Ladies' Day.\\
35 - Uh-huh.\\
36 - Ladies and little boys get in free.\\
37 - "Ladies and little boys get in free."\\
38 - Yeah. He's just like his mother.\\
39 - with Uncle Fred, you'd better go take
a nap, huh?\\
40 - Okay, Daddy.\\
41 - You go to sleep now, son.\\
42 - Good-bye.\\
43 - Ain't he a dandy?\\
44 - How about that kid, huh?\\
45 - He's a dandy.\\
46 - Listen, did the girls come back from
shopping yet?\\
47 - No, not yet.\\
48 - And I'm getting hives\\
49 - at the thought of Ethel running loose
in a department store\\
50 - with a loaded charge-a-plate.\\
51 - Well, listen, Fred,\\
52 - you can't expect the girls to go to
the opening\\
53 - of a new nightclub in an old dress.\\
54 - Ah, well, it's all your fault, too.\\
55 - If you hadn't bought a piece of the
Tropicana,\\
56 - I wouldn't be buying a piece of Saks
Fifth Avenue.\\
57 - Listen, you won't recognize the old
Tropicana.\\
58 - Boy, it's all changed.\\
59 - It's brand-new furniture, brand-new
paint job\\
60 - new bandstand, new uniforms...\\
61 - We even changed the name.\\
62 - We call it Club Babalu.\\
63 - Club Babalu?\\
64 - Yeah.
Hey, I like that.\\
65 - And wait till you hear who I got\\
66 - for the opening night.\\
67 - Who?\\
68 - Bob Hope.\\
69 - Bob Hope!\\
70 - Yeah. Bob Hope.\\
71 - His agent Jimmy Safield\\
72 - just called me and said, "It's all
set."\\
73 - Well, that's terrific.\\
74 - Yeah, there's only one thing, though.\\
75 - I made a slip the other day\\
76 - and Lucy knows that I was trying\\
77 - to get Bob Hope for the opening, you
know.\\
78 - How could you pull a boner like that?\\
79 - You know how she acts in front of
celebrities.\\
80 - I know, but I was talking on the
telephone\\
81 - and I didn't know that she was in the
apartment,\\
82 - but she doesn't need to know it's all
set\\
83 - and that Bob is going to do it.
Understand?\\
84 - Mm-hmm.\\
85 - So not a word in front of Lucy\\
86 - and not a word in front of Ethel\\
87 - and not a word in front of Little
Ricky.\\
88 - Now we got him to worry about.\\
89 - Yeah, fine way to live-- surrounded
by blabbermouths.\\
90 - Hi.\\
91 - Hiya, honey, what you do?\\
92 - Buy half of the store?\\
93 - Well, not quite.\\
94 - Fred, you'd better go give Ethel a
hand.\\
95 - She can't get up the stairs.\\
96 - She's got so many packages.\\
97 - Oh, good night, nurse.\\
98 - If I ever find where she hides that
charge-a-plate,\\
99 - I'll pound the letters down.\\
100 - Fred.\\
101 - Where is the baby, honey?\\
102 - He just went in to take a nap.\\
103 - Oh, good. Any news about the opening?\\
104 - News?\\
105 - Yeah, about the guest star.\\
106 - Did you get hold of Bob Hope?\\
107 - Bob Hope?\\
108 - Yeah. Did he call you?\\
109 - Uh... no.\\
110 - No, Bob Hope didn't call. No.\\
111 - Well, he certainly knows\\
112 - that you were waiting to hear from
him.\\
113 - He knows the opening is tomorrow
night.\\
114 - Yeah, well, you know, that's show
business.\\
115 - Well, I can't understand why he
didn't even call you,\\
116 - for heaven's sake.\\
117 - Oh, my goodness!\\
118 - Oh, I just had a horrible thought.\\
119 - What?\\
120 - Ricky, you don't suppose...?\\
121 - Oh, I know it's a wild idea,\\
122 - but you don't suppose that Bob Hope
heard about me,\\
123 - and that's the reason he hasn't
called you, do you?\\
124 - About you?\\
125 - Yeah. You know,\\
126 - those exaggerated reports\\
127 - about what happens to a celebrity\\
128 - when they meet up with me.\\
129 - No.\\
130 - No, as bad as you are, I don't
think...\\
131 - By George,\\
132 - I hate to say this, but you may be
right.\\
133 - Oh, no!\\
134 - Yeah, I think you hit it right on top
of the head.\\
135 - I think that-that Bob is afraid even
to come near you.\\
136 - Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.\\
137 - Well...\\
138 - Oh, I just feel awful.\\
139 - Well, that's all right, honey.\\
140 - Oh, this is terrible!\\
141 - Honey, you're married to a jinx!\\
142 - Now, now, now, honey...\\
143 - Yes, you are.\\
144 - Here are the lineups and
batting orders\\
145 - for today's game:\\
146 - For Cleveland, batting first\\
147 - and playing right field, Al Smith...\\
148 - Gee, a baseball game is fun.\\
149 - Kind of wish I knew what it was all
about.\\
150 - Kill the umpire!\\
151 - Stop, Ethel! Stop!\\
152 - Well, that's what you always say.\\
153 - Game hasn't even started.\\
154 - Oh.\\
155 - Oh, Lucy, come on, cheer up.\\
156 - There could be a million reasons why
Bob Hope\\
157 - hasn't called Ricky.\\
158 - No, there aren't.\\
159 - He's heard that every time\\
160 - I come near a celebrity, there's
trouble.\\
161 - It happened in Hollywood.
It happened in Europe.\\
162 - I'm a scourge of two continents.\\
163 - Oh, now, honey, that's the silliest
thing I ever heard of.\\
164 - Oh, come on, perk up.\\
165 - Red hots!\\
166 - Get your red hots!\\
167 - Get 'em while they're hot!\\
168 - Fred, Fred, I'm hungry.
Get me a hot dog.\\
169 - Did you come out here to watch a ball
game\\
170 - or to stuff your face?\\
171 - That guy down there is eating.\\
172 - He's not eating.\\
173 - He's a pitcher.\\
174 - He's chewing tobacco.\\
175 - A lot of ball players chew tobacco.\\
176 - Well, whatever it is, it sure looks
good.\\
177 - Come on, go get me a hot dog.\\
178 - That man won't be back here for
hours.\\
179 - Oh... all right.\\
180 - Can I have one, Uncle Fred?\\
181 - Okay, Little Rick.
Okay.\\
182 - Well, as long as you're up,\\
183 - you might as well bring me one, too,
Fred.\\
184 - I came out here to watch a ball game\\
185 - and I wind up as a short-order cook.\\
186 - Fred, come on...\\
187 - Can I have your autograph, Mr. Hope?\\
188 - Well, I don't know.\\
189 - You seen my latest picture, The Iron
Petticoat?\\
190 - Yes, sir!\\
191 - You watch my television show?\\
192 - Oh, yes, sir.\\
193 - You root for Cleveland?\\
194 - I own a piece of the team, you know.\\
195 - Yes, sir.\\
196 - Well, now that you've been\\
197 - properly brainwashed...\\
198 - There you are, you lucky boy.\\
199 - How are you?\\
200 - How's it going, all right?\\
201 - Listen, Ethel, you keep an eye\\
202 - on Little Ricky for a minute, will
you?\\
203 - What are you gonna do?\\
204 - I'm gonna talk to Bob Hope.\\
205 - Oh, no, you're not.

206 - Now, listen, now, listen, Ethel,\\
207 - I'm just gonna explain to him\\
208 - that I'm not really a jinx\\
209 - and I'm gonna promise to stay away
from him.\\
210 - and maybe he'll do Ricky's show.\\
211 - Oh, Lucy.\\

229 - Um, I think you and I better have a
little talk.\\
230 - Paul... Paul, the uniforms are not
here yet. They're...\\
231 - What are they doing to the floor?!\\
232 - What's the matter with the floor?!\\
233 - Calm down, Rick.\\
234 - It will be finished today.\\
235 - And by tomorrow night, it will be all
set in and dry.\\
236 - Now don't panic!\\
237 - It's my opening. If I want to panic,
I'll panic.\\
238 - Oh, say, Rick, before I forget,\\
239 - Jimmy Safield called.\\
240 - Bob Hope's out at the ball game.\\
241 - He wants you to come out there and
look over\\
242 - the material for the opening.\\
243 - Now, there's a ticket for you\\
244 - at the box office at Yankee Stadium.\\
245 - Now go on, go on.
Please go.\\
246 - I got a lot of things to do around
here.\\
247 - Are you sure that floor is gonna get
in all right?\\
248 - It'll be fine.\\
249 - Now just take it easy.\\
250 - Just go to the ball game.
Enjoy yourself.\\
251 - Yankee Stadium.\\
252 - Yankee stadium!\\
253 - 80,000 people are there.\\
254 - They couldn't possibly meet.\\

272 - Mr. Hope, I'd like to talk to you for
a minute.\\
273 - Look, I told you I don't want a hot
dog.\\
274 - But Mr. Hope,\\
275 - if I could just talk to you for a
second.\\
276 - Look, you don't get my message.\\
277 - I don't want a hot dog.\\
278 - Look upon me as a vegetarian,\\
279 - will you, please?\\
280 - Please, please, Mr. Hope...\\
281 - Will you get this thing out of here?\\
282 - The steam is taking the curl out of
my nose.\\
283 - Will you get out of here?\\
284 - Please, Mr. Hope.\\
285 - Mr. Hope, it'll only take a minute.\\
286 - You see, I don't really sell hot
dogs.\\
287 - No? What are you doing with this
thing?\\
288 - Hatching chickens?\\
289 - Oh, no. No, no...\\
290 - Red hots! Get your red hots!\\
291 - Hey, hey! Here, I'll take one.\\
292 - Oh, all right.\\
293 - Would you pass this, Mr. Hope,
please?\\
294 - The gentleman right over there.\\
295 - I want to talk to you when I get a
chance.\\
296 - Would you pass this over there,
please?\\
297 - Thank you very much.\\
298 - What I have to talk to you about\\
299 - is very important, Mr. Hope.\\
300 - Would you give him the change,
please?\\
301 - There you are, sir.\\
302 - Hey, I'll have one, too.\\
303 - Oh, uh, yes, ma'am.\\
304 - Yes, ma'am.
Here, Mr. Hope,\\
305 - would you pass that, please?\\
306 - Hey, you forgot my relish.\\
307 - Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I'm sorry.\\
308 - There you are, sir.
Thank you.\\
309 - Would you pass this over, please?\\
310 - All of a sudden, I feel like UNIVAC.\\
311 - Oh, Mr. Hope, have you got change for
a five?\\
312 - Five?
Hey, can I have some mustard?\\
313 - Yes. I'm sorry.\\
314 - Could I have some mustard, too?\\
315 - I got change for a five.\\
316 - I could shave you,\\
317 - but I got a little action going here.\\
318 - Mustard. A little mustard right
there, please.\\
319 - This is mine.\\
320 - Okay. Here you are.\\
321 - Ma'am wants a little mustard.\\
322 - Right.\\
323 - There you are. Fine.\\
324 - I've...\\
325 - Will you put a bun around this
finger?\\
326 - It looks delicious.\\
327 - Oh, Mr. Hope, I'm sorry.\\
328 - Yeah, it's all right.\\
329 - What was that?
What was that?\\
330 - Oh, nothing. Somebody just hit the
ball over the fence.\\
331 - Oh, no. Al Rosen hits a home run\\
332 - and I gotta miss it. Oh, no!\\
333 - I'm sorry, Mr. Hope,\\
334 - but if you can just let me talk to
you for just a minute.\\
335 - I'm trying to watch the game.\\
336 - Will you leave me...\\
337 - What is it?\\
338 - Mr. Hope, please,\\
339 - I have got to talk to you.\\
340 - Yeah, but, honey...
This is important.\\
341 - It's my tie.
This is very important.\\
342 - I didn't come to the ball game\\
343 - just to talk to you.\\
344 - Get your red hots!\\
345 - Get your red hots!\\
346 - Get your red hots right here!\\
347 - Get your red hots!
Get your red hots!\\
348 - This ought to help.\\
349 - There.\\
350 - Ooh.\\
351 - Ah, that's what I've always wanted--\\
352 - a quick-frozen beret.\\
353 - Relax for five minutes and take it
easy\\
354 - and then go back to see the game.\\
355 - Mm-hmm.\\
356 - Mr. Hope...
Yeah.\\
357 - there's a Mr. Ricardo outside to see
you.\\
358 - Fine. Send him in.\\
359 - Thank you very much.\\
360 - Hi, Bob. I heard about the foul ball.\\
361 - Are you all right?\\
362 - Yeah, they can't hurt me.\\
363 - I used to be in vaudeville, you know.\\
364 - I understand that a hot dog vendor\\
365 - caused the whole thin'.\\
366 - Pardon?\\
367 - A hot dog vendor caused the whole
thin'.\\
368 - You're trying to tell me something.\\
369 - Oh, yeah! Yeah!
A hot dog vendor.\\
370 - Yeah.
Yeah.\\
371 - Some real weirdo kept saying\\
372 - he wanted to talk to me-- yatata,
yatata, yatata.\\
373 - A real weirdo that kept going yatata,
yatata, yatata?\\
374 - Mm-hmm.\\
375 - What did this, uh, hot dog vendor
look like?\\
376 - Oh, tall, red hair.\\
377 - Uh-oh.\\
378 - Oh? What?\\
379 - It could be my wife.\\
380 - Are you married to a tall, redheaded
weirdo\\
381 - that goes yatata, yatata, yatata?\\
382 - Yes.\\
383 - With a mustache?\\
384 - Oh. Well, thank goodness, for once it
wasn't Lucy.\\
385 - But if you ever bump into a tall,
red-haired weirdo\\
386 - that goes yatata, yatata, yatata\\
387 - and doesn't have a moustache,\\
388 - run for your life.\\
389 - That's Lucy.\\
390 - Your wife really like that?\\
391 - Yes.\\
392 - You need this more than I do.\\
393 - Listen, Bob,\\
394 - I wanted to talk to you about\\
395 - that, uh, opening for the club, you
know.\\
396 - You got any ideas what we should do?\\
397 - Yeah, I've been thinking it over\\
398 - and I think we can do some real...\\
399 - How's the game coming?\\
400 - Oh, pretty good,\\
401 - but the game isn't over\\
402 - till the last man is out, you know.\\
403 - Well, hello, Mr. Hope.\\
404 - Well, good-bye, Mr. Hope.\\
405 - Oh, uh, uh, sonny?\\
406 - Who? Me?\\
407 - Yeah, you. Come here.
I want to talk to you.\\
408 - I don't remember seeing you with the
team before.\\
409 - Uh, no. I'm a new one.\\
410 - Well, back to the ol' ball game.\\
411 - Yeah, oh...\\
412 - Wait a minute.\\
413 - Say, you must be that new rookie\\
414 - we brought up from our farm in
Indianapolis.\\
415 - Uh, yep.\\
416 - Well, how are things down on the
farm?\\
417 - Well, farm, uh...\\
418 - Pigs are all right, but the cow died.\\
419 - Well, back to the ol' ball game.\\
420 - Wait!\\
421 - I understand you have quite a
throwing arm.\\
422 - I'd like to see your pitching motion.\\
423 - Um, all righty.\\
424 - What do you pitch?
Bonbons?\\
425 - Well, uh, I could pitch much better\\
426 - if I had a chaw of tobacco.\\
427 - All us pitchers chew tobacco, you
know.\\
428 - I'll go get some tobacco\\
429 - and come back and pitch for you
later.\\
430 - Hey, wait a minute, buddy.\\
431 - Here. Here's some chewing tobacco
right here.\\
432 - What's the matter?\\
433 - Not my brand.\\
434 - Lucy, who you do think you're
foolin'?\\
435 - Oh, you were great.\\
436 - You were a million laughs.\\
437 - Could I interest you in a stomach
pump?\\
438 - Look. Would you please tell me what
you are doing?\\
439 - Well, I was only trying\\
440 - to get Mr. Hope to appear at the
club.\\
441 - I'm sorry you got hit on the head\\
442 - when I tried to sell you a hot dog.\\
443 - Was that you, too?\\
444 - I told you. Yeah.\\
445 - I didn't recognize you without your
moustache.\\
446 - Yeah, well, now you'll never appear
at the club.\\
447 - I'll be there.\\
448 - You will?!
Yes.\\
449 - I had the whole thin' straightened
out\\
450 - with his agent this morning.\\
451 - This morning?!\\
452 - Yes.
Oh...\\
453 - Now, look, Bob, we still haven't
decided what we're gonna do.\\
454 - The opening is tomorrow night.\\
455 - What do you think?\\
456 - Well, I've got a special-material
number\\
457 - about baseball for three people.\\
458 - We'll need a couple...\\
459 - I'll need a couple partners that can
sing and dance.\\
460 - Well, I'm not exactly Gene Kelly,\\
461 - but I'd love to do it.\\
462 - Oh, that's great.\\
463 - Who else can we get?\\
464 - You stay out of this.\\
465 - I didn't say anything.\\
466 - You mean the Kiss of Death can sing
and dance?\\
467 - Well, that is a matter of opinion.\\
468 - Well, it's an easy little number.\\
469 - She might be cute in it.\\
470 - How can you say that after all she's
done to you?!\\
471 - I figure if you can't lick 'em, join
'em.\\
472 - Nothing doing.
We'll get somebody else.\\
473 - I'll talk to you later.\\
474 - Well, back to the
ol' ball game.\\
475 - I forgot my...\\
476 - Oh, what's wrong, Lucy?\\
477 - Oh, nothing.\\
478 - Aw, now, it can't be that bad.\\
479 - What's the problem?\\
480 - Well, I really did want to do that
act\\
481 - with you, Mr. Hope.\\
482 - All my life I've wanted to be in show
business,\\
483 - and doing an act with you\\
484 - would be the greatest thing that ever
happened to me.\\
485 - Well, why don't you do it, then?\\
486 - Because Ricky won't let me.\\
487 - He says I'm a jinx.\\
488 - Aw, no, now, come, come.\\
489 - Ballplayers never cry.\\
490 - I'm sorry I got mustard on you\\
491 - and I'm sorry I made you get hit on
the head.\\
492 - It's all right.
Anytime at all.\\
493 - And I'm sorry I hit you on the back\\
494 - and made you swallow your tobacco.\\
495 - Oh, that's all right.\\
496 - You got a lump on the head\\
497 - and I got a lump in my stomach.\\
498 - That's a funny joke.\\
499 - It is?\\
500 - Yeah.\\
501 - Thank you.\\
502 - You know, I sing and dance\\
503 - even better than I tell jokes.\\
504 - No!\\
505 - Yes.\\
506 - Then why doesn't Ricky let you go
into show business?\\
507 - I don't know.\\
508 - It's just professional jealousy, I
guess.\\
509 - Oh, you poor thing.\\
510 - And you know, Mr. Hope, I'm only
trying to help him.\\
511 - I'm only trying to be a good wife.
That's all.\\
512 - I can sing and I can dance.\\
513 - I can do a lot of things.\\
514 - You have no idea how talented I am.\\
515 - May I?\\
516 - Where'd you go?\\
517 - I turn around and you were gone.\\
518 - Don't speak to me, you Cuban heel.\\
519 - Wha' happen'?\\
520 - Wha' happen'?
I'll tell you wha' happen'.\\
521 - This dear little girl wants to get
into our act\\
522 - and you won't let her.\\
523 - All her life she's tried to get into
show business\\
524 - and you've held her back.\\
525 - Yeah!\\
526 - She's the best little...\\
527 - best little wife any man ever had\\
528 - and you don't appreciate her.\\
529 - Yeah.\\
530 - I think we ought to let her do the
act with us.\\
531 - Yeah!\\
532 - Nothing doing.\\
533 - No? Well, let me put it this way:\\
534 - If she doesn't do it, I don't do it.\\
535 - Yeah?\\
536 - Yeah.\\
537 - Yeah!\\
538 - Safe!\\
539 - You're out!\\
540 - Foul ball!\\
541 - Nobody loves the ump\\
542 - He's the apple of nobody's eye\\
543 - Nobody loves the ump\\
544 - And I'll never know, never know why\\
545 - Oh, they boo and they hiss and they
holler at me\\
546 - Just because it's a ball and I call
it strike three\\
547 - I'm not wearin' my glasses, so how
can I see?\\
548 - Nobody loves\\
549 - Nobody loves\\
550 - Nobody loves the ump\\
551 - If I call it a ball, then they call
me a slob\\
552 - If I call it a strike, then they call
out the mob\\
553 - If called off the game, I'd be out of
a\\
554 - Job\\
555 - Job...\\
556 - Job... job...\\
557 - You've got a lifetime job looking for
that note.\\
558 - Nobody loves\\
559 - Nobody loves\\
560 - Nobody loves the ump\\
561 - The very first inning, the fans all
commence\\
562 - They belt me with bottles\\
563 - I take no offense\\
564 - 'Cause each one they throw, I return
for two cents\\
565 - Nobody loves\\
566 - Nobody loves\\
567 - Nobody loves the ump\\
568 - The
poor old ump\\
569 - And that's without a lesson.\\
570 - Oh, if Marge sees this, Gower's
finished.\\
571 - Hey!\\
572 - Hey!\\
573 - Hey!\\
574 - Ole!\\
575 - That'll set Cuba back a hundred
years.\\
576 - What's the matter?\\
577 - My spiked shoes are caught in the
floor.\\
578 - Spiked shoes?\\
579 - Ay-ay-ay.\\
580 - Well, come on, fellas.\\
581 - Give me a couple of yanks.\\
582 - Yanks?
You have to say that word?\\
583 - Oh, come on.
The legs.\\
584 - Oh, the legs.\\
585 - Hey, hey!\\
586 - Hey, hey!\\
587 - Nobody loves the ump\\
588 - He's the apple of nobody's eye\\
589 - I'll never know, never know why\\

610 - I said, "How lovely it was."\\
611 - Why didn't he say so?\\
612 - Oh, he's a showoff.\\
613 - You made such a wonderful ump.\\
614 - I'm afraid that I danced like a chump\\
615 - Well, that's all right.\\
616 - And I'm sorry I gave you that lump\\
617 - Well, I don't care\\

19 - That's the last thing in the world I
want him to be.\\
20 - What's so bad with being a drummer?\\

of mine.\\
22 - Well, it's good enough for a husband
of yours.\\
23 - Well, that's different.\\
24 - How is it different?\\
25 - He's my flesh and blood.\\
26 - You're just a close relative.\\
27 - Well, what do you want him to be?\\

should be a drummer\\
40 - because he showed ability.\\
41 - You heard him.\\
42 - That's natural talent.\\
43 - Oh, "natural talent," my foot.\\
44 - He's trying to get the oatmeal off
his spoon.\\
45 - He was not.\\

doctor.\\

56 - I did not. He's gonna be a doctor and
that's that.\\
57 - Well, that is not that at all.\\
58 - Yes, it is now, Ricky.\\
59 - Just because I want him to be a
doctor and you want him\\

They're having a fight.\\
63 - We'll see you later.\\
64 - We're not having a fight.\\

66 - It's just that I'm right\\
67 - and he's too stubborn to admit it.\\
68 - It's not that at all.\\
69 - It is, too. You just don't want to
admit\\
70 - No!
that I'm right, that's all.\\
71 - Hold it, hold it, hold....\\
72 - Wait...
yip, yip, yip.\\
73 - Would you stop not fighting for just
a minute?\\
74 - Lucy, I came over to see if I could
borrow\\
75 - your fox stole to wear to the theater
Saturday night.\\
76 - Sure, honey, it's in the living room
closet.\\
77 - Oh, thank you!\\
78 - Well, Fred, I got the theater
tickets.\\
79 - Oh.\\
80 - Here's your pair.\\
81 - Oh, thank you, Rick.\\
82 - It was mighty nice of you to invite
us.\\
83 - That's all right.\\
84 - Oh...!\\
85 - What's the matter with you?\\
86 - For a minute I thought you were\\
87 - being strangled by a giant
caterpillar.\\

90 - this is a beautiful stole.\\
91 - Thank you.
Come on, Fred.\\

grows up.\\
96 - Hey, why don't we ask them?\\
97 - After all, they're his godparents.\\
98 - All right. What do you think he
should be?\\
99 - A wealthy, distinguished doctor\\
100 - or a crummy, out-of-work drummer?\\
101 - Well, thanks for putting it so
impartially.\\
102 - Well, that's all right.\\
103 - Uh, why don't you let him decide for
himself?\\
104 - Yeah.\\
105 - We never thought of that.\\
106 - What about it?
All right.\\
107 - We'll let him decide for himself.
Okay.\\
108 - And neither one of us will try to
influence him.\\
109 - No, neither one will try to influence
him.\\
110 - We will let him decide for himself.\\
111 - Yeah, we'll let him decide for
himself.\\
112 - All right.\\
113 - Hey, Fred, did they deliver a package
here for me?\\
114 - Yeah. I was just going to take it
over to your apartment.\\
115 - Oh, well, I, uh, I don't want you to
do that.\\
116 - I want you to keep it here for a
while.\\
117 - What are you doing, surprising Lucy
with a new hat?\\
118 - Well, uh... it's not exactly a new
hat, no...\\
119 - It's a...
it's a sort of a drum.\\
120 - How can it be "a sort of a drum"?\\
121 - It's either a drum or it isn't.\\
122 - Well, it is.
That's what it is.\\
123 - It's a drum all right.\\
124 - Now, Fred, I know what you're
thinking.\\
125 - But look at it this way.\\
126 - I just want to have it there in case
the child decides\\
127 - that he wants to play the drum
someday, that's all.\\
128 - Just to be prepared, you know.\\
129 - Well, you-you should have heard...
seen him\\
130 - the other day at the breakfast table.\\
131 - He got the thin' and he go "dink,
dink, da."\\
132 - Oh, the boy has a tremendous amount
of talent really.\\
133 - Stop hemming and hawing.\\
134 - I'm not Lucy.\\
135 - Well, then, will you keep it here
until the time is ripe?\\
136 - Sure, I'll keep it.\\
137 - Thanks a lot.\\
138 - Hi, Daddy.\\
139 - Hi, partner.\\
140 - What are you doing dressed that way?\\
141 - I'm playing doctor.\\
142 - Oh, you're playing doctor, huh?\\
143 - Little Ricky?\\
144 - Better get out of that outfit, dear.\\
145 - You know, we want to surprise Daddy\\
146 - and he's gonna be home any...\\
147 - Oh... dear.\\
148 - Yes, "Oh... dear."\\
149 - I thought we weren't gonna try to
influence him.\\
150 - I thought we were gonna let him
decide for himself.\\
151 - Yes, now, we did say that, and he did
decide for himself.\\
152 - This afternoon we just happened to be
in a toy store\\
153 - and he took me by the hand\\
154 - and dragged me over to the counter\\
155 - and pointed to the little doctor's
kit.\\
156 - He dragged you?\\
157 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
158 - Daddy, are you sick?\\
159 - Just a little, son, yeah.\\
160 - Stick out your tongue and say, "Ah."\\
161 - There you see?\\
162 - He's a natural-born doctor.\\
163 - Come on, Daddy.\\
164 - Ah...\\
165 - Mm-hmm, you'd better have your
tonsils out.\\
166 - All right. I'll do that.\\
167 - Come down to my office tomorrow.\\
168 - Okay, I will.\\
169 - Now, you know\\
170 - isn't that the cutest thing...?\\
171 - Now, Ricky...\\
172 - Of all the low tricks--\\
173 - influence him behind my back.\\
174 - Oh... shame!\\
175 - Well, he will make a good doctor.\\
176 - Ricky, this package is for you,\\
177 - but it came over to...\\
178 - Give me that package!\\
179 - What is it?
Let me see it.\\
180 - Nothing, dear.\\
181 - Well, what is it?
Let me see it.\\
182 - Nothing at all.
Is it something for me?\\
183 - Is it for me? Is it?\\
184 - Well, it was supposed to be a
surprise, dear.\\
185 - Oh, really? It looked like a hatbox.\\
186 - Yeah. Yeah, that's what it is.\\
187 - It's a hat.\\
188 - It's a hat I bought you for Easter.\\
189 - Easter?\\
190 - Yeah, well, I believe in doing\\
191 - my Easter shopping early, you know.\\
192 - A hat from Schirmer's Music Company?\\
193 - Oh-ho!\\
194 - From Schirmer's Music Company, huh?\\
195 - Yakety-yak, yakety-yak...\\
196 - What'd I do?\\
197 - Well, well, well.\\
198 - Oh, it has a very good tone for a
hat.\\
199 - Yes, sir.\\
200 - Well, now,\\
201 - I'm just gonna be the grandest lady
in the Easter parade.\\
202 - Hey, Rick, it's gone!\\
203 - Somebody must have taken the...\\
204 - Uh-oh.\\
205 - Well...\\
206 - Leave it to you, Miss United Parcel.\\
207 - How was I to know that that was a...\\
208 - Come on, Let's get out of the combat
zone!\\
209 - Well, I guess the shame is on the
other foot.\\
210 - Well, you did it, too.\\
211 - I don't care.\\
212 - This drum goes back first thing in
the morning.\\
213 - All right. So does that Junior Dr.
Kildare Kit.\\
214 - All right.\\
215 - Okay.\\
216 - All right, we'll start from
scratch.\\
217 - Okay, scratch.
Okay.\\
218 - All right.
All right...\\
219 - Honey, honey, let me take that.\\
220 - Now, darling, it has to go back to
the store in the morning.\\
221 - No, Mommy.\\
222 - Now, come on, give it to Mother. Come
on.\\
223 - I want to play the drum.\\
224 - Oh, now, honey, wouldn't you rather
play\\
225 - with your little doctor's kit?\\
226 - No, Mommy, I want to play the drum.\\
227 - Well, all right.\\
228 - I hate to admit it,\\
229 - but he does have a pretty good beat.\\
230 - Ah, yeah...\\
231 - Well, what are you doing up so early?\\
232 - Well, Little Ricky has a great beat,\\
233 - but it's not too good for sleeping.\\
234 - Oh.\\
235 - What time is it?\\
236 - 7:30.\\
237 - 7:30!\\
238 - Yeah, you must be a sound sleeper.\\
239 - He's been playing for the last hour.\\
240 - He's been playing for the last four
days.\\
241 - Should I ask him to stop, honey?\\
242 - No, no, no, no, no.\\
243 - If he wants to play, we should let
him play.\\
244 - Yeah, that's the way I feel about it.\\
245 - After all, we don't want to in-hi-bit
him.\\
246 - What?\\
247 - We don't want to in-hi-bit him.\\
248 - You know, frustrate.\\
249 - Oh, in-hibit.\\
250 - Yeah, yeah, whatever you say.\\
251 - Oh, no, no, we don't want to do that
to him.\\
252 - Want me to get you some breakfast,
honey?\\
253 - Yeah.\\
254 - How many eggs, dear?\\
255 - Two.\\
256 - Two.\\
257 - Two, two, two.\\
258 - Well, that is a catchy beat, isn't
it?\\
259 - Yeah, it sure is.\\
260 - I only wanted two eggs, dear.\\
261 - Fred? Fred?\\
262 - Fred, Fred, Fred?!\\
263 - How can you stay so calm during all
of this?\\
264 - That drumming is driving me crazy.\\
265 - Did you say something, Ethel?\\
266 - Hey, that's a good idea.\\
267 - Does it work?\\
268 - Huh?\\
269 - Does it work?\\
270 - Well, they muffle the noise,\\
271 - but your ears get hotter than blazes.\\
272 - Oh, we got to do something about
this.\\
273 - You bet your boots we do.\\
274 - Let's go over there and ask them if
they'd mind\\
275 - restricting Little Ricky's playing\\
276 - for just an hour or two a day.\\
277 - An hour or two?
How about a minute or two?\\
278 - Now, Fred, none of that. None of
that.\\
279 - If we go over there, you got to be
careful what you say.\\
280 - Parents get awful touchy\\
281 - when you're talking about their
children.\\
282 - I'm sure that if we're nice and
diplomatic,\\
283 - they'll be reasonable.\\
284 - Let's go.\\
285 - You know something?\\
286 - Maybe he should be a doctor when he
grows up.\\
287 - I can't stand it.\\
288 - I just can't stand it anymore.\\
289 - Neither can I.\\
290 - He's just gonna have to cut down\\
291 - on his practicing, that's all.\\
292 - Okay.\\
293 - Hi, fellas.
Hi.\\
294 - Oh, hi.
Oh, hi.\\
295 - Listen, I'm awfully sorry about the
noise.\\
296 - Noise? What noise?\\
297 - Little Ricky's drumming.\\
298 - Oh, that.\\
299 - Well, we never noticed it.\\
300 - Right, Ethel?
Right.\\
301 - My, he certainly loves to play.\\
302 - And, my, we certainly love to listen.\\
303 - He has such a nice, steady beat.\\
304 - Yeah, steady.\\
305 - Well, we're glad it didn't bother
you.\\
306 - Yeah, me, too.\\
307 - Bother us?
Oh, don't be silly.\\
308 - Now that you brought it up,\\
309 - we thought it might not be a bad idea\\
310 - if he'd cut down a little.\\
311 - Just a bit.\\
312 - Just to give his little hands a rest.\\
313 - Yeah, we're only thinking of the
child.\\
314 - Well, we were thinking of asking him
to just...\\
315 - What's that?\\
316 - He stopped.\\
317 - What a relief.\\
318 - I thought he'd never quit.\\
319 - What did you say?\\
320 - Oh...\\
321 - No-no-nothing.\\
322 - He's, he's just amazed at the child's
stamina.\\
323 - He didn't think anybody could keep up
that racket\\
324 - for four whole days.\\
325 - Racket?\\
326 - That is not a very nice word\\
327 - to use about my son's playing.\\
328 - We were under the impression\\
329 - that it was rhythm and music.\\
330 - Rhythm it might be; music it ain't.\\
331 - How would you know?
You got a tin ear.\\
332 - Is that so?!\\
333 - Yeah, that's so.\\
334 - Why don't you go ahead and say it?\\
335 - Go ahead!
Come right out and say it.\\
336 - Say you can't stand Little Ricky's
drumming.\\
337 - All right. We can't stand Little
Ricky's drumming.\\
338 - How dare you say a thing like that?!\\
339 - Because it's true.\\
340 - Oh!\\
341 - Come on, Fred, let's get out of here\\
342 - before that pounding starts again.\\
343 - Oh, what's the use?\\
344 - It's just the same over in our place.\\
345 - Well, don't blame that on Little
Ricky.\\
346 - Blame it on your cheap, thin walls.\\
347 - Yeah.\\
348 - As the owner of these cheap, thin
walls\\
349 - I might have you evicted for
disturbing the peace!\\
350 - You wouldn't.\\
351 - Oh, wouldn't we?\\
352 - Out you go unless you put a muffler\\
353 - on that baby bongo beater.\\
354 - Just a minute.\\
355 - Just a cotton-pickin' minute.\\
356 - Before you go evicting anybody,\\
357 - I got a piece of paper here.\\
358 - Two years ago, when we wanted to
move,\\
359 - you were so crazy about us as tenants\\
360 - that you gave us a 99-year lease.\\
361 - Yeah. That means for 97 more years,\\
362 - Little Ricky can play the drums.\\
363 - Yeah!\\
364 - Go ahead and play, son!\\
365 - Oh, Fred, let's get out of this
boiler factory!\\
366 - With pleasure!\\
367 - Honestly!\\
368 - Huh! Some friends.\\
369 - How did we ever choose them to be our
son's godparents?\\
370 - I don't know.\\
371 - Maybe we can turn them in and get two
new ones.\\
372 - Huh!\\
373 - Sheesh!\\
374 - Here are your theater tickets.\\
375 - I'm afraid we've made other plans.\\
376 - And here is your moth-eaten fur.\\
377 - Moth-eaten?\\
378 - I've trapped better-looking things
than that\\
379 - underneath my kitchen sink.\\
380 - Out!\\
381 - Out!\\
382 - Out! Out! Out!\\
383 - Don't count too much on that lease.\\
384 - Landlords have a way of getting rid\\
385 - of undesirable tenants.\\
386 - a...cualquier cosa, viejo...!\\
387 - You said it!\\
388 - Yeah! What did we say?\\
389 - It's very hard to translate,\\
390 - but take my word for it, it fits.\\
391 - Good.\\
392 - Yes, Mrs. Trumbull.\\
393 - We're leaving for the theater at
7:30.\\
394 - Well, the baby's already had his
dinner,\\
395 - so if you'll just... you'll come up
any time you want.\\
396 - Okay? Okay, dear.\\
397 - Hi.\\
398 - Oh, hi!\\
399 - How did everything go today?\\
400 - Fine, fine.\\
401 - Uh.... Mr. Mertz didn't pull any
monkey business?\\
402 - Haven't even seen him.\\
403 - I knew he was just bluffing.\\
404 - Sheesh.\\
405 - Well, if we're gonna go to the
theater,\\
406 - I'd better go get cleaned up.
All right, honey.\\
407 - Dinner's almost ready.\\
408 - I have a delicious roast chicken in
the oven.\\
409 - Good. I'll just take a quick shave
and a shower.\\
410 - All right. Hurry, up, huh?\\
411 - All right.\\
412 - Honey?\\
413 - What?\\
414 - Something is wrong with the
electricity.\\
415 - My shaver isn't working.\\
416 - Something's wrong with the gas.\\
417 - My chicken isn't working either.\\
418 - What happened?\\
419 - I don't know. It's been in for two
hours.\\
420 - Funny, the gas and electricity\\
421 - would go on the fritz at the same
t...\\
422 - Oh, no.\\
423 - What?\\
424 - I'll bet this is the work of Freddie
the Fritzer.\\
425 - Oh... he wouldn't go that far.\\
426 - Well, we'll just see.\\
427 - We'll just call the gentleman and
find out.\\
428 - Hello?\\
429 - Mr. Mertz, this is your tenant, Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
430 - The gas and electricity are off.\\
431 - Now, I know you're mean and sneaky,\\
432 - but you wouldn't stoop that low\\
433 - now, would you?\\
434 - He is that mean and sneaky!\\
435 - I'm gonna go over there and punch him
right in the nose.\\
436 - No, now, honey, that's just what he
wants you to do.\\
437 - He wants to pick a fight so he can
ask us to leave.\\
438 - Well, what are we gonna do?\\
439 - Now, wait a minute.\\
440 - The first thing in the morning\\
441 - I'll call the Board of Health to
report him.\\
442 - That'll fix him.\\
443 - Yeah. That's a good idea.\\
444 - How do you like that guy?\\
445 - Listen, we'll grab a bite to eat
downtown.\\
446 - All right, dear.\\
447 - What am I gonna do about shaving?\\
448 - Oh, you don't need a shave.\\
449 - You look wonderful.\\
450 - I'll just take a quick shower, huh?\\
451 - Okay.\\
452 - How did he ever forget that?\\
453 - La-la-la di a-la di\\
454 - La-lai la-lei la-lai.\\
455 - Hey, honey, I just thought of
somethin'.\\
456 - What?\\
457 - What are we gonna do\\
458 - when Mrs. Trumbull comes over
tonight?\\
459 - She can't sit here in the dark all
night long.\\
460 - She's gonna take the baby back to her
apartment,\\
461 - and we'll pick him up when we come
back.\\
462 - Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.\\
463 - Oop!\\
464 - ?Que paso? El agua, se seco el agua.\\
465 - No hay agua aqui.
What happened?\\
466 - I know. The water is off in the
basin, too.\\
467 - Phantom Freddie has struck again!\\
468 - Ai! Mira, ?que quiere el hombre de
esta cosa?\\
469 - Oh, honestly, that man.\\
470 - Listen, honey,\\
471 - there's an... an emergency valve in
the back porch.\\
472 - Go turn it back on.\\
473 - Honey, I can't. I can't see.\\
474 - I-I-I... I can't open my eyes.\\
475 - I'll get soap in them.\\
476 - Oh, all right, I'll go and get it.\\
477 - I'm sorry, dear.\\
478 - All right. I'll get it. Oh...\\
479 - Oh, honestly, that man.\\
480 - Hurry up, honey.\\
481 - Que barbaridad...\\
482 - Sheesh.\\
483 - Ooh! Ooh!\\
484 - Ai dios!\\
485 - Ooh, hurry up, honey.
Yes, I'll...\\
486 - I'm getting soap in my eyes.
Hurry up!\\
487 - Oh, honey,    Ooh!
all right.\\
488 - Ooh! Ooh...\\
489 - You took the towel!\\
490 - Oh, dear.\\
491 - Oh, Ricky.\\
492 - You took the towel.\\
493 - For heaven's...\\
494 - Ah!\\
495 - Oh!\\
496 - Oh!!\\
497 - Ah!\\
498 - Honey, the water is back on!\\
499 - You're telling me!\\
500 - What happened?\\
501 - What happened?\\
502 - Oh, honestly, honey.
Look at me.\\
503 - Oh, oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Honey, my hair.\\
504 - Now I won't be able to go anyplace.\\
505 - Oh, dear!\\
506 - Darn that Fred Mertz!\\
507 - What a fiend!\\
508 - What a fiend that man is!\\
509 - Oh...\\
510 - He probably thinks that\\
511 - this is gonna make us move.\\
512 - Well, he's got another thing coming.\\
513 - We've only begun to fight.\\
514 - You got an idea?\\
515 - Follow me!\\
516 - Okay.\\
517 - Get this right here.\\
518 - Here-- you take this.\\
519 - What are we gonna do?\\
520 - They want to be nasty,\\
521 - we'll give them something to be nasty
about.\\
522 - Oh, a little drum concert, right?\\
523 - Yes. We're gonna play a little
well-known Latin-American tune\\
524 - called "Nurtz to the Mertz Mambo."\\
525 - Let them hear it, boy!\\
526 - Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.\\
527 - They're probably having dinner.\\
528 - Let's play the serenade from the
kitchen.\\
529 - Oh, that's a good idea, yeah.\\
530 - That way, they won't miss a single
glorious beat.\\
531 - Ha, ha, ha, ha!\\
532 - What are you doing?\\
533 - Just a little added sound effects.\\
534 - Ready?\\
535 - Yeah.\\
536 - One, two, three, four.\\
537 - One, two, three, four.\\
538 - Just a minute!\\
539 - Fred, go on, call the police!\\
540 - He's not gonna call the police on my
telephone.\\
541 - Too cheap to use your own phone, huh?\\
542 - Yeah.
Yeah.\\
543 - Too cheap to use your phone, huh?\\
544 - Are you gonna stand there\\
545 - and let that Havana "Horace" Hite\\
546 - call you cheap?\\
547 - No, I'm not!\\
548 - Now put them up!\\
549 - Listen, you lay a hand on me\\
550 - and you'll have to use the telephone\\
551 - Put them up!
to call the hospital!\\
552 - Yeah.
Call the hospital!\\
553 - Yeah, let me tell you, I can take you
on, too.\\
554 - What's the matter?
What happened?\\
555 - Where's the baby?\\
556 - I came up to take him.
He's not in his room.\\
557 - Are you sure?
What?!\\
558 - He's not in his room?\\
559 - Did you look every place, Mrs.
Trumbull?\\
560 - I looked all over the place.\\
561 - Did you look in all the closets?\\
562 - Oh... Little Ricky?\\
563 - Oh, Little Ricky?\\
564 - No, he isn't in there!\\
565 - No.
He isn't in there.\\
566 - The door was open when I came in.\\
567 - The door was open!
He might be outside!\\
568 - I'll go get him.\\
569 - I'll get my coat and go with you.\\
570 - Get your coat, Fred.\\
571 - I'll call the police!\\
572 - Oh...\\
573 - Operator? Operator?\\
574 - Operator, the police!
Get me the police!\\
575 - Oh, Lucy, where do you suppose he
went?\\
576 - How do I know?
Take it easy.\\
577 - He's wandering around outside.\\
578 - Wait, wait, wait.\\
579 - Take it easy, everybody.\\
580 - Everything is all right.\\
581 - Did you find him?\\
582 - Follow me.\\
583 - Never mind, operator.\\
584 - Aw, the poor little thing.\\
585 - He couldn't stand all that noise.\\
586 - The next time we fight, we'll fight
more quietly.\\
587 - We're not going to have any more
fights, Ethel.\\
588 - It was all our fault.\\
589 - No. No, Fred, it was our fault.\\
590 - We promise you from now on\\
591 - he won't play the drums so much.\\
592 - You let him play the drums as much as
he wants to.\\
593 - He can do half of his practicing\\
594 - right here in our place.\\
595 - Fred!\\
596 - What's the matter, Ethel?\\
597 - We're only going to be here for 97
years.\\
598 - Oh, Lucy...\\
599 - You think you can stand us that long?\\
600 - Oh, Lucy, I'm so sorry, honey!\\
601 - Ah, Rick.
All right, Fred.

22 - How?\\
23 - Spend it in Florida.\\
24 - Well, winter is officially here.\\
25 - We've had our first cold wave.\\
26 - Fred's put on his red flannels, and
you've started your annual\\
27 - "Let's Send Lucy To Florida"
campaign.\\
28 - Well, I don't see any reason\\
29 - why we couldn't spend just a few
weeks in Florida.\\
30 - Don't talk to me, talk to Ricky.\\
31 - I'm going to, but it won't do any
good.\\
32 - He'll have a million excuses:\\
33 - It's too far, it's too expensive,\\
34 - and he can't get away.\\
35 - Those are three of the worst excuses\\
36 - I ever heard in my whole life.\\
37 - It's just ridiculous leaving us\\
38 - But does he ever think of us?\\
39 - No! He just thinks of himself.\\
40 - Hi.\\
41 - Hi, honey.\\
42 - Don't "honey" me, you selfish beast.\\
43 - And so, once again,\\
44 - it's time to play that well-known
parlor game,\\
45 - "Kick The Cuban."\\
46 - Good luck, amigo.\\
47 - Whatsa matter with everybody?\\
48 - Why can't we go to Florida?\\
49 - Well, first of all, there's a lot...\\
50 - Who said anything about Florida?\\
51 - I did, but we can't go because\\
52 - it's too far, it's too expensive,\\
53 - and you can't get away.\\
54 - I didn't say a word!\\
55 - Well, can we go?\\
56 - No!\\
57 - Why not?\\
58 - Because it's too far, it's too
expensive, and I can't get away.\\
59 - Oh! Everybody goes to Florida for the
winter.\\
60 - Even the birds go south.\\
61 - All right, I'll make you a deal:\\
62 - If you can get there the same way the
birds do, you can go.\\
63 - Now, Ricky, listen...\\
64 - Look, Florida is out of the question,\\
65 - so don't nag me.\\
66 - Mommy!\\
67 - Coming, dear.
Don't go away.\\
68 - I've got a lot of nag I haven't even
used yet.\\
69 - Hello?\\
70 - Oh, hi, Rick.\\
71 - This is Paul.\\
72 - Oh, yeah, hi, Paul.\\
73 - Say, I've got great news for you.\\
74 - I just spoke to Orson Welles' agent.\\
75 - He's all set to do the benefit.\\
76 - He'll meet you here this
afternoon for rehearsal.\\
77 - Oh, that's just wonderful!\\
78 - Listen, is he gonna do the same act
that he did in Las Vegas?\\
79 - Yeah, some Shakespeare, and, of
course, his magic routine.\\
80 - Oh, that is just great.\\
81 - What time am I supposed to meet him?\\
82 - 4:00 here at the club.\\
83 - He's tied up autographing record
albums\\
84 - at some department store until then.\\
85 - Okay, I'll be there.\\
86 - Oh, by the way, Orson needs an
assistant for his magic act,\\
87 - so I suggested Lucy to him.\\
88 - You did?\\
89 - Yes.\\
90 - You are fired!\\
91 - Now, wait a minute.\\
92 - Wait a minute.
You don't have to blow your top!\\
93 - It's only a benefit.\\
94 - Look, whenever Lucy gets into the
act, nobody benefits.\\
95 - I'm, I'm sorry.\\
96 - I'll get out of it.\\
97 - Yeah, well, tell him that she's going
out of town.\\
98 - Oh? Is she?\\
99 - She is now.
She's going to Florida.\\
100 - Oh. Well, okay, I'll tell him.\\
101 - Okay. I'll see you later.\\
102 - Sheesh!\\
103 - And another thing:\\
104 - You've always wanted Little Ricky to
know to swim.\\
105 - If we went to Florida, he could take
swimming lessons.\\
106 - I agree with you.\\
107 - Yeah, that's right.
Don't listen to reason.\\
108 - Just be pigheaded and stubborn and
keep us here all...\\
109 - What did you say?\\
110 - I said that you were absolutely
right.\\
111 - Oh, honey!\\
112 - Little Ricky and you should go to
Florida.\\
113 - Do you really mean it?\\
114 - Of course I do.\\
115 - I have been a selfish beast.\\
116 - Oh, no, you haven't, honey!\\
117 - Ethel!\\
118 - Fred! Come quick!\\
119 - Oh, honey, you're the best husband in
the whole world!\\
120 - Oh, thank you!\\
121 - You and Little Ricky can leave right
away.\\
122 - I'll come down as soon as I can.\\
123 - Okay, honey.\\
124 - What's the matter?\\
125 - Guess what?
Guess what?\\
126 - Ricky's sending me and the baby to
Florida.\\
127 - Wonderful!\\
128 - Isn't that great?\\
129 - I'm going to tell the baby, honey.\\
130 - Oh! Freddy...\\
131 - you know, I'm commencing to feel this
cold weather myself.\\
132 - Well, you won't have to worry about
the cold, honeybunch.\\
133 - I won't?\\
134 - Nope. Tomorrow I'll run out and buy
you\\
135 - a brand-new hot water bottle.\\
136 - Oh, fine.\\
137 - Ricky?\\
138 - Yes, dear?\\
139 - If I'm going to Florida,\\
140 - I'm going to have to buy a lot of new
clothes.\\
141 - You're right.\\
142 - I am?\\
143 - Yes. Here, honey.\\
144 - Oh.\\
145 - Buy anything that you want.\\
146 - Oh!\\
147 - What happened to him?\\
148 - I don't know,\\
149 - but let's get to the store before he
snaps out of it.\\
150 - I'll get my hat.\\
151 - Well, I promised Little Ricky
I'd get him a beach ball.\\
152 - They ought to have one in here.\\
153 - See, those are volleyballs.\\
154 - Oh, Ethel, look at this!\\
155 - What is that?\\
156 - Skin diving equipment.\\
157 - Oh, just what you need.\\
158 - You're right.
I'm going to Florida.\\
159 - I'm going to skin dive.\\
160 - Now, Lucy, don't you get into enough
trouble on dry land?\\
161 - Oh, push-tush.\\
162 - May I help you?\\
163 - Yes. I'd like to see\\
164 - some of the skin-diving equipment.\\
165 - You know, I'd kind of like\\
166 - to try some of it on and see how it
works.\\
167 - Oh, well, this is our complete
skin-diving kit.\\
168 - Just step this way, please.\\
169 - Skin diving kit!\\
170 - I'll wait out here for you.\\
171 - This way.
All right, honey.\\
172 - Okay, thank you.\\
173 - Oh, y'all just follow me into the
record department here.\\
174 - Now, if you select your records here,
he'll be here any moment.\\
175 - Oh, uh, pardon me, sir, but why is
this crowd gathering?\\
176 - Oh, they're waiting for Mr. Orson
Welles.\\
177 - Orson Welles!\\
178 - Yes! He's going to autograph his new
Shakespearean album.\\
179 - He'll be here any moment.\\
180 - He'll be here?!
Right here?!
Yeah.\\
181 - Just select one.\\
182 - Here he comes!\\
183 - Oh, well! Oh!\\
184 - Oh, Mr. Welles, I really want to see
you.\\
185 - Uh, Mr. Welles?\\
186 - Lucy! Lucy, Orson Welles is here!\\
187 - Come on. He won't stay long.\\
188 - Come on.\\
189 - Let us through.\\
190 - Would you mind letting us through,
please?\\
191 - Mr. Welles!\\
192 - Mr. Welles!\\
193 - My "Man From Mars" broadcast was 18
years ago.\\
194 - What kept you?\\
195 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
196 - Ethel, help me.\\
197 - Let me help you.\\
198 - I'm sorry, but you see, I'm going to
Florida.\\
199 - Underwater all the way, I presume?\\
200 - No, no, of course not.\\
201 - Mr. Welles, Mr. Welles,\\
202 - I've seen everything you've ever
done--\\
203 - in movies, on the stage, in
television.\\
204 - I think you're just marvelous.
Just marvelous.\\
205 - Me, too.
I think so, too.
Thank you.\\
206 - Mr. Welles, you won't believe this,\\
207 - but I played Shakespeare in high
school.\\
208 - I believe it.\\
209 - Yes, sir. I-I played the lead in
Romeo and Juliet\\
210 - in the senior play.\\
211 - Did I ever tell you that?\\
212 - 32 times.\\
213 - Oh. Oh, uh, uh, Mr. Welles,\\
214 - Mr. Welles, my dramatic teacher said\\
215 - that I was the best Juliet she'd ever
seen,\\
216 - and she said that she wouldn't be a
bit surprised\\
217 - if-if I ended up as...\\
218 - ...a star on the
Broadway stage.\\
219 - Hmm, uh, you took 16 curtain calls.\\
220 - There wasn't a dry eye in the house.\\
221 - You were in the audience!\\
222 - Alas, no.\\
223 - Well, then, how did you know?\\
224 - Oh, every girl I ever meet has played
poor Juliet\\
225 - to an audience that's practically
awash\\
226 - with overactive tear ducts.\\
227 - Well, I really was and they really
were.\\
228 - Hmm.\\
229 - If you don't believe me, ask Miss
Hanna.\\
230 - Who's Miss Hanna?\\
231 - Who's Miss Hanna?!\\
232 - Just the greatest dramatic teacher\\
233 - Jamestown High School ever had,
that's all.\\
234 - Oh, I see. How many albums would you
like?\\
235 - Well, I'd like one.\\
236 - Just autograph it to Ethel Mertz,
please.\\
237 - I'd take two, only we haven't got a
phonograph.\\
238 - I'll take one.\\
239 - And please autograph it to that great
Shakespearean actress,\\
240 - Lucy Ricardo.\\
241 - Lucy Ricardo?\\
242 - Wh-Where have I heard that name
before?\\
243 - Romeo and Juliet, Jamestown High
School.\\
244 - You're Ricky Ricardo's wife!\\
245 - Oh, you know him?\\
246 - But of course! I'm doing that charity
benefit\\
247 - at his nightclub.\\
248 - You are?\\
249 - Why, yes. I'm, I'm terribly sorry\\
250 - you couldn't take me up on my offer.\\
251 - Offer? What offer?!\\
252 - Well, I wanted you to help me out in
the act.\\
253 - But Ricky said you were going to
Florida.\\
254 - Oh, he did, did he?\\
255 - Yeah.
How do you like that?\\
256 - How do you like that?\\
257 - Oh...
That conniving Cuban!\\
258 - No wonder he was so nice to you.\\
259 - He just wanted to get you out of town
until Mr. Welles blew over.\\
260 - How about that?\\
261 - Mr., Mr. Welles...\\
262 - Mr. Welles, is the job still open?\\
263 - Well, you're, you're going to
Florida.\\
264 - Oh, I changed my mind.\\
265 - I'd love to do the show for you.\\
266 - Can I have the job, Mr. Welles? Can
I?\\
267 - Can I? Can I?\\
268 - Mrs. Ricardo, please, take your
flippers off me.\\
269 - I'm sorry.\\
270 - I'm sorry, but-but can I, can I have
the job?\\
271 - Well, I'm sure you can...\\
272 - you can handle it very nicely.\\
273 - If you'd just come over to your
husband's nightclub\\
274 - this afternoon, we can rehearse.\\
275 - I'll be there, sir.
I'll be there.\\
276 - Did you hear that?
I heard. I heard.\\
277 - I got the job.
I got the job.\\
278 - Oh, that's wonderful.
I'm going to do Shakespeare.\\
279 - Good-bye, Mr. Welles.\\
280 - "Farewell.\\
281 - "Farewell.\\
282 - Parting is such sweet sorrow."\\
283 - So we'll just charge\\
284 - these albums and send them out
tomorrow.\\
285 - Hey!\\
286 - Did you hear that voice?\\
287 - Yes!\\
288 - You are going to be on that show.\\
289 - He's a wonderful pal.\\
290 - Yes, that's right, operator.\\
291 - Jamestown, New York, 4755, please.\\
292 - Hello?\\
293 - Miss Hanna?\\
294 - Yes?\\
295 - Miss Hanna, this is Lucy Ricardo.\\
296 - Who?\\
297 - Lucy Ricardo.\\
298 - Lucy McGillicuddy.\\
299 - Who?\\
300 - Juliet.\\
301 - Juliet McGillicuddy?\\
302 - No, Miss Hanna.\\
303 - Uh, uh, I played Juliet.\\
304 - Herman Schlup was Romeo.\\
305 - Herman Schlup.\\
306 - Now, let me see.\\
307 - Herman was so short, we had to lower
the balcony two feet.\\
308 - Oh, of course!\\
309 - Lucy McGillicuddy.\\
310 - Well, how are you, little Lucy?\\
311 - I'm fine, Miss Hanna.\\
312 - Guess what?\\
313 - I'm going to do Shakespeare with
Orson Welles!\\
314 - What class was he in, dear?\\
315 - No, Miss Hanna, the famous Orson
Welles.\\
316 - Oh, that one.\\
317 - Oh, how exciting!\\
318 - Yes, isn't it?\\
319 - We're appearing at my husband's
nightclub\\
320 - this Friday night here in New York,\\
321 - and I thought maybe you could come up
and watch me perform.\\
322 - Friday?\\
323 - Yes.\\
324 - Oh, I'm sorry, dear,\\
325 - but it's the drama class's opening
night\\
326 - of The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial.\\
327 - One of the boys is sick,\\
328 - and I may have to play Captain Queeg.\\
329 - Oh. Well, I'm sorry, Miss Hanna.\\
330 - Well, may I send you the notices?\\
331 - Oh, would you, my dear?\\
332 - Thank you so much.\\
333 - And good luck, Lucy.\\
334 - And remember, project.\\
335 - Play to the balcony!\\
336 - Oh, I will, Miss Hanna.\\
337 - Good-bye.\\
338 - I mean...\\
339 - Good-bye, Miss Hanna.\\
340 - "Dost thou love me?\\
341 - "I know thou wilt say 'aye.'\\
342 - "Aye?\\
343 - Aye!"\\
344 - Is Ricky home?\\
345 - No, not yet.\\
346 - I thought I heard someone saying
"ay-ay-ay."\\
347 - That was me.\\
348 - I'm practicing playing to the
balcony.\\
349 - Oh. I heard all that yelling,\\
350 - and I thought you two were having a
fight.\\
351 - Well, stick around, girl.\\
352 - I'm gonna tell him just what I think\\
353 - of his little scheme of shipping me
out of town.\\
354 - Hi, honey.
Hi.\\
355 - Hi, Ethel.\\
356 - Well, did you find some nice clothes
for Florida?\\
357 - Yes, I found a lot of cute things at
Macy's.\\
358 - Good. After all,\\
359 - I want my wife to be well dressed.\\
360 - Guess what else I found at Macy's?\\
361 - What?\\
362 - Orson Welles,\\
363 - and we had a very interesting little
chat.\\
364 - Bye.\\
365 - Where do you think you're going?\\
366 - From the look in your eyes, back to
Cuba.\\
367 - You come right back here.\\
368 - What a cheap chiseling trick\\
369 - trying to bundle me off to Florida\\
370 - just to keep me from playing
Shakespeare with Orson Welles!\\
371 - What are you talking about,
"Shakespeare"?\\
372 - All he wanted you to do was help in
his magician act.\\
373 - He did not want me to help in his
magician act!\\
374 - He did, too.\\
375 - He just wanted you to hand him things\\
376 - while he performs.\\
377 - I don't believe you.\\
378 - It's true!\\
379 - Uh... as a matter of fact, that's why
I turned him down.\\
380 - I was only thinking of you.\\
381 - How do you figure?\\
382 - Well, it was, eh...
such a nothing part\\
383 - that, uh, I wanted to save you the
embarrassment\\
384 - of having to turn him down.\\
385 - Now you understand?\\
386 - Well, when you put it that way, yes.\\
387 - I understand.\\
388 - Ah, now, I knew you would.\\
389 - Thank you for protecting me.\\
390 - I will always do that.\\
391 - I'll talk to you when I come back
from the club.\\
392 - All right, honey.\\
393 - I just stopped by to pick my
briefcase.\\
394 - Okay.
Good-bye.\\
395 - Good-bye, Rick.\\
396 - Good-bye, dear.\\
397 - What a sweetheart.\\
398 - What a phony.\\
399 - What do you mean?\\
400 - You didn't believe all that hokum,
did you?\\
401 - That's just another one of his
tricks.\\
402 - Lucy, are you sure?\\
403 - Sure, I'm sure.\\
404 - Would he send me all the way to
Florida\\
405 - just to keep me from handing Orson
Welles\\
406 - a hat full of rabbits?\\
407 - No. What a phony!\\
408 - It's Shakespeare all right.\\
409 - Ethel, will you cue me?\\
410 - I want to go over my lines again.\\
411 - Sure, I will.\\
412 - Gee, I just want to be letter-perfect\\
413 - when I go to rehearsal.\\
414 - Who knows? With Orson Welles playing
opposite me,\\
415 - I might even top my performance at
Jamestown High School.\\
416 - Listen, I like some of these
pictures.\\
417 - They're very good.\\
418 - This is good.
Mm-hmm.\\
419 - I don't like this one.
It's too much teeth.\\
420 - All right...\\
421 - put all those rabbits in the cloak
room\\
422 - and I'll be, uh...\\
423 - Hi, Orson.\\
424 - Hello, Ricky.\\
425 - Glad to see you.\\
426 - Listen, it's just wonderful of you to
do this benefit for us.\\
427 - Oh, it's my pleasure.\\
428 - I saw your act in Las Vegas Really?\\
429 - and I thought you were just great.\\
430 - Thanks.\\
431 - Oh, uh, incidentally, uh,\\
432 - Lucy won't be able to be your
assistant after all.\\
433 - Oh, I'm sorry.
I saw her in Macy's,\\
434 - and she told me that she'd love to do
it.\\
435 - Yeah, I know, but she changed her
mind.\\
436 - Would you sit down?
I'll get you some coffee.\\
437 - Sure, sure.\\
438 - I guess, uh, you'll just have\\
439 - to find somebody else to saw in half.\\
440 - Oh, I don't saw anybody in half
anymore.\\
441 - I do the, uh, levitation trick.\\
442 - The what?\\
443 - The levitation.\\
444 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
445 - Well, uh, she can't do that, whatever
it is.\\
446 - Well, that's where\\
447 - I raise somebody off the ground, you
know.\\
448 - Uh-huh. Well, uh,\\
449 - Lucy's two feet off the ground always
anyway,\\
450 - but she can't do it.\\
451 - Well, I'm sorry.\\
452 - Better safe than sorry.\\
453 - Why?\\
454 - Well, it just seems that every time\\
455 - that Lucy gets close to famous
people,\\
456 - something happens to them.\\
457 - You mean she really did\\
458 - all those things in Europe and
Hollywood?\\
459 - Every one of them.\\
460 - And they call me a character.\\
461 - Well, I could tell you stories\\
462 - about this girl that you wouldn't
believe.\\
463 - Like one time...\\
464 - "Oh, Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art
thou, Romeo?\\
465 - "Deny thy father and refuse thy name
or...\\
466 - "if thou wilt not be but sworn, my
love,\\
467 - and I'll no longer be...
a Capulet."\\
468 - What do you think, Mr. Welles?\\
469 - Uh, well...\\
470 - tha... that had its moments.\\
471 - There was a... a certain\\
472 - indefinable something about it.\\
473 - What about it, Ricky?\\
474 - Lucy, I thought I told you\\
475 - that Mr. Welles wanted you for his
assistant\\
476 - in his magic act.\\
477 - You don't think I fell for that, do
you?\\
478 - No, but it's true.
I really do.\\
479 - Oh, Mr. Welles, I promised my
dramatic teacher\\
480 - that I was going to do Shakespeare
with you.\\
481 - I even promised I'd send her the
notices.\\
482 - Oh, I'm awfully sorry.\\
483 - Lucy, can't you see that\\
484 - Mr. Welles does not want to do
Shakespeare with you?\\
485 - You keep out of this!\\
486 - Mr. Welles, won't you at least read a
scene with me?\\
487 - It's been my lifelong ambition to do
Shakespeare with you,\\
488 - Mr. Welles.
Lucy.\\
489 - I think you're the greatest\\
490 - Shakespearean actor in the whole
world.\\
491 - I think You're better than John
Gielgud.\\
492 - I think you're better than...
than Maurice Evans.\\
493 - I think you're better than...
than Sir Ralph Richardson.\\
494 - You left out Laurence Olivier.\\
495 - Well, I think you're better than he
is, too.\\
496 - You really think so?\\
497 - Yes, I do, Mr. Welles.\\
498 - I really do.
Please do Shakespeare with me.\\
499 - Just read a scene with me now\\
500 - so that I can tell my grandchildren\\
501 - about it someday.\\
502 - Please, Mr. Welles.\\
503 - "What man art thou\\
504 - "that thus bescreened in night,\\
505 - so stumblest on my counsel."\\
506 - Lucy, can't you see that Mr. Welles\\
507 - does not want to do Shakespeare with
you?\\
508 - You keep out of this.\\
509 - "By a name, dear heart,\\
510 - "I know not how to tell you how I am.\\
511 - "My name is hateful to myself.\\
512 - Had I it written, I would tear the
words."\\
513 - "Had I it written, I would tear the
words."\\
514 - That's the cue.\\
515 - "I..."\\
516 - "Had I it written, I would..."\\
517 - I know, I guess I'm a little nervous\\
518 - at last playing with the great Orson
Welles.\\
519 - Oh, why don't we do my favorite
scene?\\
520 - What's that?
"For fear of that I still\\
521 - "will stay with thee\\
522 - and never from this palace of dim
night depart again."\\
523 - Oh, that one.\\
524 - Well, I'm already dead in that scene.\\
525 - Yes, yes.\\
526 - "Here, here will I set up my
everlasting rest..."\\
527 - But Mr. Welles, you just have the
soliloquy in that one.\\
528 - "...and shake the yoke of
inauspicious stars\\
529 - I don't have it.
"from this world-wearied flesh.\\
530 - "Eyes, look your last.\\
531 - I...
"Arms, take your last embrace.\\
532 - "And lips, o you the doors of breath\\
533 - "seal with a righteous kiss,\\

543 - Thank you.\\
544 - You're just wonderful.\\
545 - Mr. Welles, are you sure you won't
change your mind\\
546 - and-and let me do just a little
Shakespeare\\
547 - in your act with you?\\
548 - Well, you see, The way the act is
built...\\
549 - I know, I'm a lot better\\
550 - when I'm not nervous, Mr. Welles.\\
551 - The way it's arranged,\\
552 - we just do the soliloquies, you
understand?\\
553 - But my offer still stands\\
554 - for you to do the assistant in the
magic act.\\
555 - Well, I don't know.\\
556 - Well, take it or leave it.\\
557 - I'll take it.\\
558 - Good. All right, Ricky, come on.\\
559 - Let me show you...\\
560 - Oh, honey, aren't you excited?\\
561 - This is gonna be your big night.\\
562 - Yeah, what a comedown--\\
563 - from a Shakespearean actress to a
magician's stooge.\\
564 - What are you complaining about?\\
565 - I turned out to be the stooge's
hairdresser.\\
566 - Come in.\\
567 - Miss Hanna!\\
568 - Lucy McGillicuddy!\\
569 - Oh, Miss Hanna, what a surprise!\\
570 - Oh, this is Miss Hanna,\\
571 - my high school dramatic teacher.\\
572 - Miss Hanna, Mrs. Mertz.\\
573 - How do you do?\\
574 - Lucy's told me all about you.\\
575 - Oh, she has?
Oh, little Lucy.\\
576 - Oh, Miss Hanna, won't you sit down?\\
577 - Mi-Miss Hanna, what happened\\
578 - to Caine Mutiny Court-Martial?\\
579 - Well, we postponed it\\
580 - until Captain Queeg gets over the
chicken pox.\\
581 - Oh. Well, Miss Hanna...\\
582 - So I brought the rest of the cast
with me.\\
583 - You did?\\
584 - Oh, imagine, you and Orson Welles.\\
585 - Oh, I'm sure it'll be an evening of
sheer magic.\\
586 - You can say that again.\\
587 - Miss... Miss Hanna, about this
evening...\\
588 - My dear, I've been teaching drama for
25 years,\\
589 - and this is the proudest night of my
life.\\
590 - It is?\\
591 - Oh, just to hear you do\\
592 - that balcony scene with Orson Welles\\
593 - will make my entire teaching career
worthwhile.\\
594 - Miss Hanna, I have something to tell
you.\\
595 - I...
Yes, Juliet?\\
596 - I'll see you after the show, Miss
Hanna.\\
597 - All right, my dear.\\
598 - And remember what I told you:\\
599 - project.
Yes.\\
600 - Tr-r-r-rippingly on the tongue.\\
601 - Oh, Lucy, you should've told her.\\
602 - She's in for an awful letdown.\\
603 - No, she isn't.\\
604 - What do you mean by that?\\
605 - I am not going to disappoint Miss
Hanna.\\
606 - Somehow, someway, I'm going to do
Shakespeare.\\
607 - And now...\\
608 - enough of Shakespeare.\\
609 - We'll try to entertain you now\\
610 - with a few feats of magic,
legerdemain, hanky-panky\\
611 - and sidearm snookery.\\
612 - From the mysterious East...\\
613 - The inscrutable...\\
614 - the inimitable...\\
615 - the mysterious...\\
616 - Princess Lu-Si.\\
617 - Professor...\\
618 - Ladies and gentlemen,\\
619 - please.\\
620 - I must beg you not to make the
slightest sound\\
621 - 'cause the princess is in a state of
trance.\\
622 - "Oh, Romeo, Romeo,\\
623 - wherefore art thou, Romeo?"\\
624 - Bravo, bravo!\\
625 - "Deny thy father...\\
626 - ...refuse thy name..."\\
627 - Apparently the princess\\
628 - is not, uh, in a deep enough
condition of trance.\\
629 - Now the princess...\\
630 - will feel nothing...\\
631 - and definitely speak nothing.\\
632 - "Oh, Romeo, Romeo,\\
633 - wherefore art thou, Romeo?"\\
634 - It just happens that I have\\
635 - a pack of playing cards in my hand.\\
636 - "...and refuse thy name...\\
637 - or if thou wilt not..."\\
638 - Perhaps somebody...\\
639 - "Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo?"\\
640 - Romeo?\\
641 - Romeo, get me down from here.\\
642 - Romeo!\\

1 - Lucy?\\
2 - Yeah.\\
3 - What about my lunch?\\
4 - Oh, yeah.
Right away, dear.\\
5 - I was getting Little Ricky ready for
his recital.\\
6 - He looks so cute.
Good.\\
7 - Oh, I'm so nervous.\\
8 - Imagine our son playing drums in
public for the first time.\\
9 - Yeah, it's quite an occasion all
right.\\
10 - Oh, it sure is.\\
11 - Hmm.\\
12 - Well?\\
13 - Well what?\\
14 - What about my lunch?\\
15 - Oh, yes, honey.\\
16 - I got a nice sandwich for you\\
17 - all ready in the refrigerator.\\
18 - That's funny.\\
19 - Lucy...
What?\\
20 - The refrigerator is that big, white
thing back there.\\
21 - Oh, sure. What's the matter with me?\\
22 - Here it is.\\
23 - There you are, dear.\\
24 - Thank you.\\
25 - And I have some hot coffee here.\\
26 - Here we are.\\
27 - Oh, gee, isn't this exciting?\\
28 - Mm-hmm.\\
29 - Mmm!\\
30 - What's the matter?
What's the matter?\\
31 - Oh, honey, it's too hot.\\
32 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
33 - Well, look, we'll just do this.\\
34 - This is what my mother used to do.\\
35 - There we are.\\
36 - That'll cool it off.\\
37 - There you are, dear.\\
38 - It's cooler all right,\\
39 - Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.\\
40 - There you are, dear.\\
41 - Mmm, honey, it's still too hot.\\
42 - Maybe an ice cube will help, huh?\\
43 - An ice cube, an ice cube, an ice
cube. Yeah.\\
44 - Okay, dear.\\
45 - Here we are.\\
46 - There's an ice cube for you.\\
47 - That's a very good idea.\\
48 - Lucy...
Yeah?\\
49 - Do you always put the ice cubes in
the oven?\\
50 - Oh, no.\\
51 - Not always, dear. No.\\
52 - Honey, calm down.\\
53 - Why are you so nervous?\\
54 - Oh, honey, I can't help it.\\
55 - I just can't help it.\\
56 - He's such a baby.\\
57 - Do you think we're rushing him?\\
58 - Aw, now, honey, it's just a little
recital\\
59 - at his music school.\\
60 - I know, I know, but this is such a
big moment\\
61 - in my child's life.\\
62 - I'm just nervous about it.
That's all.\\
63 - What's with you?
It's your child, too.\\
64 - How come you're so calm?\\
65 - Well, what is there to be uncalm
about?\\
66 - Nothing to worry. At the recital,
he'll be great.\\
67 - Now, uh, are you ready?\\
68 - Yeah, I'm all ready.\\
69 - Is Little Ricky ready?\\
70 - Yeah, he's ready.
How about you?\\
71 - I've been ready for hours.\\
72 - Come on, let's go.\\
73 - Oh, honey, look at you.\\
74 - Not nervous, huh?\\
75 - Well, I guess so.\\
76 - Yeah, I guess you are.\\
77 - I'll call the Mertzes and see if
they're ready.\\
78 - Hi, Lucy.
Hi.\\
79 - Have you seen Ethel?\\
80 - I can't find my green tie.\\
81 - No. She hasn't been here.\\
82 - Well, I'll be ready in a minute.\\
83 - Yeah, hurry up.\\
84 - Lucy, have you seen Fred?\\
85 - I was taking the spot off his tie.\\
86 - I can't find him anywhere.\\
87 - He was just here looking for you.\\
88 - Oh, thanks.\\
89 - Are you sure Ethel isn't over here?\\
90 - She was just here looking for you.\\
91 - Well, I'll find her.\\
92 - Lucy, he isn't over there.\\
93 - Over there.\\
94 - Where have you been?!\\
95 - I've been looking all over for you.\\
96 - How do you like that?\\
97 - For the first time in 20 years,\\
98 - we've been trying to find each other.\\
99 - Get your tie on.\\
100 - Let's go.\\
101 - Yeah, hi.\\
102 - Let's get
going.	  All right.\\
103 - We're all ready, dear.\\
104 - Oh, I'm as nervous as a cat.\\
105 - Me, too.\\
106 - I was so nervous, I couldn't eat my
breakfast.\\
107 - And, believe me, for Ethel, that's
nervous.\\
108 - Oh, look who's talking.\\
109 - He was so nervous, he got dressed
first\\
110 - and then took a shower.\\
111 - Ethel, have we no family secrets?\\
112 - Why is everybody so jittery?\\
113 - Yeah, what's the matter with us?\\
114 - It's silly to be this way.\\
115 - 'Course, the kid has been taking drum
lessons for a month\\
116 - and we know he's good.\\
117 - Good? Why, he's wonderful.\\
118 - That kid's dynamite.\\
119 - That's right. So what do we have to
worry about?\\
120 - Yeah, why worry about it?\\
121 - Honey, do you really think he's good?\\
122 - Now, look, Lucy,\\
123 - I have complete confidence in the
boy.\\
124 - It just so happens\\
125 - that he has inherited his father's
musical ability.\\
126 - Yeah, but is he good?\\
127 - Look, didn't Mr. Crawford said\\
128 - that he was the best drummer in the
school?\\
129 - Uh-huh.
Well, there you are.\\
130 - 'Course he's the only drummer in the
school.\\
131 - Now, honey, don't worry...\\
132 - Hi, Uncle Fred.
Hi, Aunt Ethel.\\
133 - Oh, hi!\\
134 - There he is.\\
135 - Well, now, how do you feel, honey?\\
136 - Fine, Mommy.\\
137 - Look how calm he is.\\
138 - Sure. Perfectly relaxed.\\
139 - That's kids for you.\\
140 - You're not nervous, are you, honey?\\
141 - No.\\
142 - Yeah, he's not a bit nervous.\\
143 - We knew you wouldn't be.\\
144 - Mommy...
What, honey?\\
145 - what's nervous?\\
146 - Nervous? Well, that's, uh,\\
147 - when you get stage fright,\\
148 - like when you're playing drums in
front of strangers!\\
149 - Oh, go get your coat on, honey.\\
150 - Yeah, get your coat.\\
151 - We'll get our hats and coats, honey.\\
152 - We'll be right back.\\
153 - We can help you with the drums.\\
154 - Okay.
What's the matter with you?\\
155 - Oh, honey, I didn't mean to say
anything in front of him.\\
156 - I didn't want to put ideas in his
head,\\
157 - but I just didn't think...\\
158 - Well, maybe it didn't register,\\
159 - but just, you know, if we're calm,\\
160 - then he'll be calm now.
Yeah.\\
161 - Just you and I don't...\\
162 - It's kind of hard to be calm.\\
163 - Well, just you and I don't get
nervous\\
164 - Okay.
and then the kid\\
165 - will be all right.\\
166 - If we don't get all upset...\\
167 - I just didn't think that...\\
168 - Come on now, we don't want to be
late.\\
169 - You're not nervous, are you, Rick?\\
170 - No, not nervous.\\
171 - Well, the two coats were there,\\
172 - and then we were talking.\\
173 - I didn't... didn't see what I was
doing.\\
174 - Let's go.
Let's get this...\\
175 - Everybody grab something.\\
176 - All right.
Let's go.\\
177 - I can carry this.\\
178 - Okay.\\
179 - Now...\\
180 - Have we got everything?\\
181 - I think so.
Sorry, dear.\\
182 - I got the bass drum.
Here's the snares.\\
183 - I got the cymbal.\\
184 - I got the tom-tom.\\
185 - Okay, we've got everything. Let's go.\\
186 - All right, here we go.\\
187 - Thank you.
Thank you, Laurie Blaine.\\
188 - That was very nice, Laurie.\\
189 - That was really very nice.\\
190 - Now, Diana Van Fossen\\
191 - will favor us with a selection on the
violin.\\
192 - Diana.\\
193 - That's my little girl.\\
194 - Oh, she's very sweet.\\
195 - She's very good.\\
196 - Thank you.\\
197 - Oh, that was Diana Van Fossen.\\
198 - Oh, say, Diana...\\
199 - Aw, say, that was nice.\\
200 - Now, as a, as a finale for our little
recital here,\\
201 - our own little six-piece band is
going to play\\
202 - "Has Anybody Seen My Gal?"\\
203 - Well, well, first, on bass, Buddy
Noble.\\
204 - Buddy, Buddy, come in.\\
205 - Bass.\\
206 - Ukelele, Earl Robie.\\
207 - Come in, Earl.\\
208 - And trumpet, Robert Norman.\\
209 - Come in, Robert.\\
210 - And trombone, Jeff Woodruff.\\
211 - Hello, Jeff.\\
212 - And accordion, Larry Gleason.\\
213 - Come, Larry.\\
214 - Come on, Larry.\\
215 - And on drums, Ricky Ricardo, Jr.\\
216 - Yeah!\\
217 - And on drums, Ricky Ricardo, Jr.\\
218 - No, no!\\
219 - No, no, no, no, no!\\
220 - Mom-mom-...
What...\\
221 - What's the matter, honey?\\
222 - Mommy, Mommy...\\
223 - What's the matter?\\
224 - What's the matter?\\
225 - I'm nervous, Mommy.\\
226 - I got stage fright.\\
227 - I told you...
He's got stage fright.\\
228 - Oh, he's sorry.
He's got stage fright.\\
229 - It's all right.\\
230 - Look, Ricky. It's all right, Ricky.\\
231 - Lucy.
What?\\
232 - What are you doing?\\
233 - Well, his drums have been in the
closet for three whole days.\\
234 - He hasn't even gone near them.\\
235 - I thought maybe if I put them out\\
236 - in plain sight...\\
237 - I thought we agreed not to force him
to play.\\
238 - Who's forcing him?\\
239 - I'm just going to use the power of
suggestion.\\
240 - If he sees the drums out here,\\
241 - he may want to play them, that's all.\\
242 - All right, but I don't want to make
him play.\\
243 - I want it to be his own idea.
Oh, honey.\\
244 - Now you know I won't make him do
anything he didn't want to do.\\
245 - I won't say a word.
The drums will be out here.\\
246 - If he wants to play them, fine.\\
247 - Okay. I gotta go get finish dressing.\\
248 - I gotta get out of here.\\
249 - All right, honey.\\
250 - Hi. You want to go to the grocery
store with me?\\
251 - I can in about half an hour.\\
252 - Oh, Lucy, Little Ricky's playing his
drums again.\\
253 - No, no, no, honey, this is just my
idea.\\
254 - I thought if I put them out,\\
255 - maybe I'd put the idea in his head.\\
256 - Oh. Gee, I sure hope it works.\\
257 - Oh, me, too.\\
258 - Call me when you're ready to go to
the store.\\
259 - Okay, dear.\\
260 - Maybe I can get a little dusting
done.\\
261 - Okay.\\
262 - Now, Lucy...\\
263 - you'll be glad to know\\
264 - that I'm going to fix that loose
railing on the back porch.\\
265 - Well, what's the rush?\\
266 - We only reported it five years and
three delivery boys ago.\\
267 - Very, very funny.\\
268 - Hey, is my godson coming out of
retirement?\\
269 - No, your godson isn't coming out of
retirement.\\
270 - I'm just putting the drums out here.\\
271 - If he wants to play them, he can.\\
272 - Now, listen, mother hen, don't peck
at me\\
273 - because you're upset about your baby
chick.\\
274 - Little Ricky.\\
275 - Yes.\\
276 - Hi. What you doing, honey?\\
277 - Just playing.\\
278 - Oh.\\
279 - Oh, boy!\\
280 - That's what I've been wanting to play
with!\\
281 - It is?\\
282 - Yeah.\\
283 - My crayons.\\
284 - Your crayons.\\
285 - By George, somebody put your drums
out here!\\
286 - They look kind of lonely.\\
287 - I bet they wish somebody would play
them.\\
288 - Well, if nobody wants to play them, I
think I will.\\
289 - I'm playing your drums.\\
290 - Oh, Little Ricky, come back here.\\
291 - Look at the fun I'm having.\\
292 - Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da\\
293 - Bum, bum, bum, bum bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, da, da...\\
294 - Little Ricky!\\
295 - I knew it!
I knew it!\\
296 - Honey, you were right...!\\
297 - Back to your chores, fellow loved
ones.\\
298 - I goofed.\\
299 - Didn't anything happen?\\
300 - Well, nothing, except I may put out
an album\\
301 - called Music To Color By.\\
302 - Do you really think so, Mr. Crawford?\\
303 - Ooh, absolutely.\\
304 - Stage fright is just like falling off
a horse.\\
305 - If you don't get right back on,
you'll never ride again.\\
306 - Is that so?\\
307 - Yes, and I want you to know, Mrs.
Ricardo,\\
308 - I'm every bit as concerned about your
boy\\
309 - as you and Mr. Ricardo are.\\
310 - Well, thank you, Mr. Crawford.\\
311 - We certainly appreciate that, and
thanks for the advice.\\
312 - I'll... I'll talk to my husband when
he comes in.\\
313 - Ah, good-bye.\\
314 - Good-bye, Mr. Crawford.\\
315 - What does he want to talk to me
about, honey?\\
316 - Little Ricky's got to get right back
on his horse.\\
317 - What?!\\
318 - When you fall off a horse,\\
319 - you've got to get right back on.\\
320 - Little Ricky fell off a horse?\\
321 - What was he doing on a horse?\\
322 - Oh, relax, honey, he didn't really
fall off a horse.\\
323 - Oh. Why did you say so?\\
324 - Mr. Crawford was just using a figure
of speech.\\
325 - He meant that if we wanted to help
Little Ricky\\
326 - get over his stage fright,\\
327 - we wanted to make sure that he played
in public again\\
328 - as soon as possible.\\
329 - Oh. Well, that's the way he got
frightened\\
330 - in the first place.\\
331 - That's just the point.\\
332 - This is now the cure.\\
333 - Well, I don't know, honey.\\
334 - I think we're making too much of
this.\\
335 - Maybe the kid just doesn't want to
play the drums.\\
336 - Look, whether he wants to play the
drums or not\\
337 - is no longer important.\\
338 - The big thing now is his fear.\\
339 - Being afraid to play at the recital
was only the beginning.\\
340 - From here on, he could develop a fear
of all sorts of things.\\
341 - He might be afraid to go to school.\\
342 - He might be afraid to meet people,
appear in public.\\
343 - Why, if we don't conquer this right
now,\\
344 - it could ruin his whole life.\\
345 - Well, that makes a lot of sense.\\
346 - Boy, I'm sure glad\\
347 - that you're the mother of my child.\\
348 - Well, thank you, dear.\\
349 - When I think of all those other women\\
350 - I might have married...\\
351 - Yeah, you sure were
lucky.\\
352 - All what other women?\\
353 - Uh... like you say,\\
354 - we have enough problems already.\\
355 - Yeah. We'll just talk about that
later.\\
356 - Right now the important thing\\
357 - is finding a place for Little Ricky\\
358 - to play in public as soon as
possible.\\
359 - All right.
What do you suggest?\\
360 - Well, I was thinking...\\
361 - why can't Little Ricky and his band
play\\
362 - at your club one night?\\
363 - Lucy...\\
364 - what's come over you?\\
365 - Bad idea, huh?\\
366 - No.\\
367 - Good idea.\\
368 - What's come over you?\\
369 - Well, I don't know.\\
370 - I guess I just make a mistake now and
then.\\
371 - I think it's a wonderful idea.\\
372 - You do?\\
373 - Oh, sure. It's probably just what he
needs\\
374 - to snap him out of this mood that
he's in.\\
375 - Uh-huh.
And I bet you\\
376 - that the audience will love it.\\
377 - Well, honey, I'm so happy you like my
suggestion.\\
378 - Yes, baby.\\
379 - Close your eyes, Ethel.\\
380 - I don't want you to get any wild
ideas.\\
381 - Hi.\\
382 - Hi.\\
383 - We bought Little Ricky a present.\\
384 - Oh, how cute.\\
385 - A little teddy bear that plays the
drum.\\
386 - We figured he might take the hint.\\
387 - That cost 49 cents,\\
388 - but in a case like this, money is no
object.\\
389 - Well, gee, it's a wonderful idea\\
390 - and thanks a lot,\\
391 - but I think we've got the problem all
settled.\\
392 - You have?\\
393 - Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna have\\
394 - Little Ricky and his band play at the
Club Babalu one night.\\
395 - You are?!\\
396 - Yeah. We decided that if he's not
going\\
397 - to go through life being afraid, he
has...\\
398 - he just has to play the drums again.\\
399 - Right away.\\
400 - Oh, of course!\\
401 - Oh, boy, I'm glad it's all settled.\\
402 - Wait a minute.\\
403 - Is it all settled?\\
404 - If we can't get him to play here in
the living room,\\
405 - how are we going to get him to play
at the club?\\
406 - Hey, that's right.\\
407 - If we could get him to play at the
club,\\
408 - we wouldn't have to get him to play
at the club.\\
409 - That makes sense.\\
410 - Or does it?\\
411 - Of course it does.\\
412 - The trick is how to get Little Ricky
to do it.\\
413 - Oh.\\
414 - One of us will just have to go in
there\\
415 - and talk him into it.\\
416 - Okay.\\
417 - Well?\\
418 - Well?\\
419 - You're his father.\\
420 - You're his mother.\\
421 - Well, now that we got it straight\\
422 - who his parents are,\\
423 - which one is going in there and talk
to him?\\
424 - Why don't you?\\
425 - Me?\\
426 - Yeah. Why not?\\
427 - You're his godfather.\\
428 - Well, you're his godmother.\\
429 - Well, now that we got it straight\\
430 - who his godparents are, which one of
you\\
431 - is going to go in there and talk to
him?\\
432 - Go ahead, Ethel.\\
433 - Me?\\
434 - Yeah, go ahead, Ethel.\\
435 - All right, I will.\\
436 - I'll use reverse psychology on him.\\
437 - That always works with children.\\
438 - Mm-hmm.\\
439 - Well?\\
440 - What happened?\\
441 - Did your reverse psychology work?\\
442 - Not exactly.\\
443 - I said, "Little Ricky, you don't want
to play\\
444 - those nasty old drums, do you?"\\
445 - And he said, "No."\\
446 - Oh, my.\\
447 - Well, now what will we do?\\
448 - All right, all right.\\
449 - You can talk him out of his stage
fright.\\
450 - If anybody can talk anybody into\\
451 - doing anything, it's Lucy.\\
452 - Yeah, she's good at that sort of
thing.\\
453 - Sure.\\
454 - Next.\\
455 - What's the matter?\\
456 - Can't you talk him into it?\\
457 - I got stage fright.\\
458 - Oh, no.\\
459 - Well, I guess that leaves you and me,
Fred.\\
460 - It leaves you.\\
461 - I'm chicken.\\
462 - Very well.\\
463 - Hi, pardner.\\
464 - Hi, Daddy.\\
465 - I brought a surprise for you.\\
466 - It's a present from Uncle Fred and
Aunt Ethel.\\
467 - Thank you.\\
468 - You're welcome.\\
469 - Um...\\
470 - What do you say we have a little
talk, huh?\\
471 - Okay.\\
472 - You know, when I was a little boy
your age,\\
473 - I used to love to go down to my
daddy's office and visit him,\\
474 - but I don't have an office.\\
475 - I work in a nightclub.\\
476 - The Babalu?\\
477 - That's right.\\
478 - How'd you like to come to the Babalu
and visit me?\\
479 - I'd like that, Daddy.\\
480 - Okay.\\
481 - And, uh, would you like to bring your
drums with you\\
482 - and your little band and play there?\\
483 - Will you be there, Daddy?\\
484 - I sure will.\\
485 - Will other people be there?\\
486 - Yeah.\\
487 - I'll stay home.\\
488 - You'll stay home, huh?\\
489 - Why? Are you afraid?\\
490 - Well, now, you come over here,
pardner.\\
491 - You know, I want to tell you
something.\\
492 - It's all right to be afraid.\\
493 - You know, when I play in front of
people, I'm afraid, too.\\
494 - I don't know whether they're going to
like me\\
495 - or whether they're going to laugh at
me or what.\\
496 - Is that the way you feel?\\
497 - Yes, Daddy.\\
498 - But... the minute I start playing,\\
499 - the minute that I hear the music,\\
500 - I'm not afraid anymore.\\
501 - I'll show you what I mean.\\
502 - You see our little friend here?\\
503 - Look at that.\\
504 - He's so scared, he can't even move.\\
505 - Now, let's pretend\\
506 - that he's gonna play at the club,
see?\\
507 - And let's pretend that all these are
the people in the audience\\
508 - and they're all sitting around\\
509 - and they're gonna watch him play the
drums, see?\\
510 - Now, let's see what happens to him,
okay?\\
511 - Look at him go, see?\\
512 - He's not afraid anymore.\\
513 - And look at them.\\
514 - They're not laughing at him.\\
515 - They like him.\\
516 - And if they like him,\\
517 - they'll like you a lot more,\\
518 - because you're a much better drummer
than he is.\\
519 - So, uh...\\
520 - what do you say, pardner?\\
521 - Okay, pardner.\\
522 - Good boy.\\
523 - There you are, Robert.\\
524 - Oh, Robert looks great, doesn't he?\\
525 - There you are, honey.\\
526 - Okay.
There you are.\\
527 - Oh, hi.\\
528 - Everybody here, Mr. Crawford?\\
529 - Everybody but Earl Robie, the ukelele
player.\\
530 - Well, you'd better call the house and
find out if he's left.\\
531 - Well, that's a good idea.\\
532 - Yeah. Listen, kids, you want to peek\\
533 - at the audience through the curtains?\\
534 - Yeah.		Yeah.\\
535 - Peek at the audience, that's
lots of fun.\\
536 - Get your instruments.\\
537 - We might as well put them on the
bandstand, huh?\\
538 - Well, listen, honey, will you bring
him right back?\\
539 - Want to go, Ricky? Sure, I'll bring
him right back.\\
540 - Because I haven't finished dressing
him yet.\\
541 - Okay. I'll bring him right back.\\
542 - You come right back now, darling.\\
543 - Just let him take a peek.\\
544 - Okay. Oh, don't they look cute?\\
545 - I'll say.
Yes, yes.\\
546 - Oh, boy, I hope this idea works.\\
547 - Me, too. My stomach's so full of
butterflies,\\
548 - I could start a collection.\\
549 - Honey, now, whatever you do, don't
say anything\\
550 - about being nervous in front of
Little Ricky.\\
551 - Oh, no, now, Fred, don't even mention
the word "scared"\\
552 - or "stage fright" now.\\
553 - Okay, okay.
Be sure.\\
554 - Don't forget now.\\
555 - Okay, son.
Hey, uh...\\
556 - Get him ready right away, Mom.\\
557 - I'm starting the show right now.\\
558 - All right, honey, we will.\\
559 - Well, did you see all the nice
people?\\
560 - I'll say.\\
561 - How do you feel, honey?\\
562 - Fine, Mommy.\\
563 - Attaboy. You're not the least bit
ner...\\
564 - What are you trying to do, scare...\\
565 - Watch yourselves.\\
566 - You're going to give Little Ricky
sta...ay\\
567 - as sweet as you are, dear.\\
568 - Oh, dear!\\
569 - What's the matter?\\
570 - Of all things.\\
571 - What?\\
572 - Earl Robie can't be here.\\
573 - He has the measles.\\
574 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
575 - No ukelele player.\\
576 - And they've rehearsed for six, and
now they've only got five.\\
577 - I don't know how it'll sound.\\
578 - It will just blow the whole thing
wide open.\\
579 - Mr. Crawford...\\
580 - Oh, oh, this is the most terrible
thing\\
581 - that could have happened to us.
Mr. Crawford...\\
582 - Oh, what a cata...\\
583 - No, ukelele!\\
584 - Mr. Crawford...\\
585 - Yes, but I told Mr. Ricardo\\
586 - that I... I'm so nervous.\\
587 - Mr. Crawford.\\
588 - Here, honey. Put your hat on,
sweetheart.\\
589 - Here we go. We're all ready now.\\
590 - Mommy...
Yes, dear?\\
591 - I don't want to play without a
ukelele.\\
592 - Oh, now, honey, don't worry about a
thing.\\
593 - Everything is going to be just fine.\\
594 - Here are your drumsticks.\\
595 - But I don't want to play without a
ukelele.\\
596 - Now, look, honey...\\
597 - Honey, look, I promise you...\\
598 - I promise you, you'll have a ukelele
player.\\
599 - Do you hear?\\
600 - Fred, get a message to Ricky.\\
601 - Tell him the band will play as
scheduled.\\
602 - All right, all right.\\
603 - Look, fix his coat.\\
604 - Okay, I'll fix his coat.\\
605 - I'll button up your coat.\\
606 - And you go out there and just be
great\\
607 - and play your drums.\\
608 - Thank you.
Thank you very much.\\
609 - Thank you.\\
610 - Thank you very much.\\
611 - Ladies and gentlemen,\\
612 - tonight we have a-a-a wonderful new
attraction for you\\
613 - here at the Club Babalu\\
614 - and I am indeed very proud to present
to you\\
615 - Ricky Ricardo, Jr.
and his Dixieland Band.\\
616 - Hey!\\
617 - Let's go!\\
618 - Hey, hey, hey!\\
619 - Yeah!\\
620 - Hey, hey!\\
621 - Let's get it on!\\
622 - Okay, pardner?\\
623 - You bet!\\
624 - Well, uh, you were wonderful!\\
625 - You sure were.
\subsection {Episode 05: Visitor From Italy (1956)}
1 - Listen, I'll go get Fred and Ethel.\\
2 - Oh, don't bother, honey.\\
3 - They'll be right over.\\
4 - Oh, all right.\\
5 - Hey, you know something?\\
6 - We haven't played bridge since before
we went to Europe.\\
7 - I know. I'll bet I've forgotten\\
8 - everything I ever knew about bridge.\\
9 - Good, then maybe we can win.\\
10 - Oh, pooh.\\
11 - Well, why the formality?\\
12 - Come on in.\\
13 - Really.\\
14 - Yes?\\
15 - Senora Ricardo.\\
16 - Senora Ricardo, it's so good to see
you again.\\
17 - It's so good to see you again, Senor
Ricardo.\\
18 - Uh, well, uh, it's good to see you
again, too.\\
19 - Yeah, yeah, it sure is.\\
20 - You know, you said, "If ever you come
to America,\\
21 - you must be sure and stop and say
hello."\\
22 - Hello.\\
23 - Hello.\\
24 - Hello.\\
25 - Hello.\\
26 - Hello.\\
27 - When I got off of the boat\\
28 - this morning from Italy,\\
29 - I said to myself,\\
30 - "Suppose the Ricardos don't remember
me?"\\
31 - Oh, not remember you?\\
32 - Oh-ho, imagine not remembering him.\\
33 - Yeah. How about that?\\
34 - You...\\
35 - How could we possibly forget you?\\
36 - Yeah, good ol'... you.\\
37 - Uh, Ricky, can I see you in the
kitchen for a moment?\\
38 - Make yourself at home.
Grazie.\\
39 - Excusa momento.\\
40 - Grazie.
Yeah.\\
41 - Who is he?\\
42 - I don't know.\\
43 - His face is awfully familiar, but
I... I...\\
44 - Well, think. Now, who do we know from
Italy?\\
45 - I can't place him, honey.\\
46 - I know. Florence.\\
47 - Florence who?\\
48 - Florence, Italy.\\
49 - He's that friend of the Leders'\\
50 - that was so nice to us.\\
51 - Oh, yeah.
Yeah.\\
52 - So, you just got off the boat today,
huh?\\
53 - That's right.\\
54 - And New York, she's a beautiful city.\\
55 - Yeah, well, not as half as beautiful
as Florence, I'll bet.\\
56 - By the way, how are things in
Florence?\\
57 - I don't know. I was never in
Florence.\\
58 - So, you just got off the boat today,
huh?\\
59 - That's right.\\
60 - And when I got off the boat in
America,\\
61 - I said to myself, I says, "Mario..."\\
62 - Mario.\\
63 - Mario.\\
64 - Mario?\\
65 - I said, "Mario, the first thing you
got to do\\
66 - is to look up your old friends, the
Ricardos and the Mertzes."\\
67 - Oh, the Mertzes.
The Mertzes!\\
68 - Well, they live right across the
hall.\\
69 - Yeah. I'll go get them.\\
70 - I'll go get them.\\
71 - Yeah, they live...
Ah!\\
72 - Uh, look who's here.
Mario!\\
73 - Yeah, Mario.\\
74 - Mario, oh, how are you?
Senora Mertz.\\
75 - Oh, and Senor Mertz.\\
76 - Man, what a surprise.\\
77 - How's it going, boy?\\
78 - Fine. Just fine.\\
79 - Fred, Ethel, could we see you\\
80 - in the kitchen for a moment, please?\\
81 - Yeah.
Sit down, Mario.\\
82 - Excusa minute.
Sit down.
Grazie. Grazie.\\
83 - Who is he?\\
84 - Don't you know?\\
85 - No. Don't you?\\
86 - No. I thought you did.\\
87 - Oh, dear.\\
88 - All we know is that his name is
Mario,\\
89 - and he met us someplace in Europe.\\
90 - Well, I got a clue.\\
91 - What?			What?\\
92 - He's Italian.\\
93 - Listen, let's see\\
94 - if we can try to find out what-what
city he's from.\\
95 - That's a good idea.\\
96 - Yeah, if we know the city,\\
97 - maybe we can place his face.\\
98 - Yeah.
Yeah, huh?\\
99 - Well, we...
we certainly\\
100 - enjoyed our trip through Italy.\\
101 - Rome?\\
102 - Naples?\\
103 - Genoa?\\
104 - San Remo...\\
105 - Oh, San Remo!
San Remo!\\
106 - San Remo!
San Remo!\\
107 - Someday I would like to go there.\\
108 - So, you just got off the boat today,
huh?\\
109 - That's right.\\
110 - And you know something?\\
111 - You haven't changed a bit.\\
112 - You all look just like you look in
the picture\\
113 - you gave me.\\
114 - Picture?\\
115 - The one you took in my gondola\\
116 - on the Grand Canal.
Gondola!\\
117 - Grand canal.\\
118 - Venice.\\
119 - Mario!\\
120 - Mario, the gondolier!\\
121 - Ah, si, bueno.
Ah, si, Mario.\\
122 - How long you gonna be in town?\\
123 - Well, just for few months.\\
124 - Oh.\\
125 - I-I come to surprise my brother
Dominic.\\
126 - Oh, that's right.\\
127 - You told us you had a brother in New
York.\\
128 - Yeah.
That's right.
He was not there.\\
129 - Oh?
Somebody said\\
130 - he went to visit Sam Francesco.\\
131 - I wrote it down on a piece of paper.\\
132 - Ah... ah... ah, ah.\\
133 - Maybe Mrs. Ricardo,\\
134 - maybe you can help me.
Sure.\\
135 - How can I find this Sam Francesco?\\
136 - Well, let's see now...\\
137 - Well, my writing, she's not so pretty
good.\\
138 - No. That's all right.\\
139 - "44 West Third..."\\
140 - Oh, this isn't Sam Francesco.\\
141 - It's San Francisco.\\
142 - Who?\\
143 - Not "who," "what."\\
144 - San Francisco's a big city.\\
145 - Oh... well, maybe you can tell me how
I get there.\\
146 - Can I, can I walk?\\
147 - Oh, not from New York, no.\\
148 - It's 3,000 miles away.\\
149 - Eh!\\
150 - Yes, you'll have to take a train or a
plane or bus.\\
151 - Yeah.
Train, plane... oh.\\
152 - Well, I got $10.\\
153 - Is she enough?\\
154 - Oh, no, I'm afraid she isn't.\\
155 - No. It's about $60 by bus.\\
156 - $60. Mama mia!\\
157 - Oh, well, now, Mario, don't worry.\\
158 - We'll all chip in and help you.\\
159 - Sure, Mario.
We'll give you the money.\\
160 - Sure, we'll be glad to.\\
161 - Won't we, Fred?\\
162 - Yeah, glad.\\
163 - No, no, I'm sorry.\\
164 - Borrowing is no way to start a
vacation in America. No.\\
165 - Well, why not?
That's the way\\
166 - Americans always start their
vacations.\\
167 - Besides, if we don't give you the
money,\\
168 - how you going to get to see your
brother?\\
169 - Yeah.
Well, I work.\\
170 - I get a job and make the money to pay
the... the bus.\\
171 - Well, all right, Mario.\\
172 - If you want to get a job, we'll help
you get a job.\\
173 - Sure. Mario, what can you do?\\
174 - Well, I'm the best gondolier in all
of Venice.\\
175 - Oh, dear.\\
176 - No, I'm afraid it's slack season\\
177 - for gondoliers in New York.\\
178 - Unless you go down to Canal Street.\\
179 - Fred.\\
180 - Hey!\\
181 - I-I got an idea.\\
182 - I know where he can get a job--\\
183 - in Ricky's nightclub.\\
184 - He can?\\
185 - Yeah. He can work as a busboy.\\
186 - He can?\\
187 - Sure. He can make $60 in a couple of
nights.\\
188 - He can?\\
189 - Well, if he won't take the job, I
will.\\
190 - Uh, look.\\
191 - You stay here with us\\
192 - and-and then you go to work tomorrow
night.\\
193 - $60 for two days.\\
194 - My goodness.\\
195 - America, she's a great country.\\
196 - Good morning, honey.\\
197 - Morning. Where's Mario?\\
198 - I don't know.
He was gone when I got up.\\
199 - Look, when he comes back, give him
this check for $60\\
200 - and put him on the bus.\\
201 - Put him on the bus? Why?\\
202 - Is something wrong?\\
203 - Oh, no, no, no.\\
204 - You and your bright ideas.\\
205 - What happened?\\
206 - Well, first of all,\\
207 - he thought that the nightclub was in
a canal in Venice.\\
208 - What do you mean?\\
209 - He collected all the garbage and
threw it out the window.\\
210 - Well, now, that was a honest mistake.\\
211 - That's just the beginning.\\
212 - When I stopped singing "Babalu,"\\
213 - he stopped to applaud.\\
214 - So what? I've seen busboys applaud
before.\\
215 - While they're carrying a tray full of
dishes?\\
216 - Well, he's not the first busboy\\
217 - that ever drop a tray full of
dishes...\\
218 - Wait, wait, there's more.\\
219 - There's more?\\
220 - Yeah.\\
221 - As he bent over to clean the mess
that he had made,\\
222 - the maitre d' was coming in with a
cake for some newlyweds.\\
223 - Oh, no.\\
224 - Oh, yeah.\\
225 - He tripped over Mario,\\
226 - the whole thing went up in the air,\\
227 - and that bride and groom\\
228 - have the world's first upside-down
wedding cake.\\
229 - Oh, my goodness.\\
230 - What happened to Mario then?\\
231 - The last I saw of Mario,\\
232 - the maitre d' and the chef each had
him by an arm\\
233 - and they were carrying him out the
back door.\\
234 - Oh, dear.\\
235 - So, just give him the $60 and put him
on the bus.\\
236 - Honey, I don't think he's ever gonna
believe\\
237 - that he should get all this money\\
238 - for just one night's work.\\
239 - Look, Lucy, he thought that America
was a great country.\\
240 - Well, just tell him that\\
241 - it's a little greater than he thought
it was.\\
242 - Maybe I can get another idea for a
job...\\
243 - I can't afford any more of your
ideas.\\
244 - Oh, honey....
Now, make up your mind.\\
245 - It's either\\
246 - "Arrivederci, Mario or "Good-bye,
Lucy."\\
247 - Oh, hi, Mario.\\
248 - Buon giorno, Senora.\\
249 - Um, Mario, I have good news for you.\\
250 - Si, senora?\\
251 - You're going to be on your way to see
your brother today.\\
252 - Ricky left your pay with me.\\
253 - My-my pay?\\
254 - Yeah, for last night at the club.\\
255 - I can't take the money.\\
256 - Why not? It's your pay.\\
257 - No. Last night, I'm a-get fire.\\
258 - No, Mario.
You didn't get a-fire.\\
259 - Yes, I'm a-get fire.\\
260 - Mario, I think you misunderstood.\\
261 - Ricky said that you...\\
262 - Please, Senora Ricardo,\\
263 - my English is not so pretty good,
but...\\
264 - in my country, when two men grab me,
push me to the door\\
265 - and kaploopa, I'm a-fire!\\
266 - Well, look, Mario,\\
267 - will you accept this money as a
friendly gesture\\
268 - from our country to yours?\\
269 - Grazie a molto.\\
270 - No.\\
271 - How are you going to get to see your
brother?\\
272 - I got good news, too.\\
273 - I got another job.\\
274 - Another job?\\
275 - Si. I was taking a walk.\\
276 - I pass by a pizza restaurant.\\
277 - In the window, I see a sign\\
278 - that says, "somebody to make pizza."\\
279 - That's me.\\
280 - I go inside, I get the job.\\
281 - Well, that's just wonderful.\\
282 - And now I stay three more days,\\
283 - make enough money to go see my
brother Dominic\\
284 - in San Francisco.\\
285 - Three more days...
and nights.\\
286 - Uh, excuse me.\\
287 - Uh, sit down, Mario.\\
288 - Grazie, grazie.\\
289 - Could I see you in the kitchen for a
minute?\\
290 - Ethel, how'd you like to play\\
291 - a new game called "hide the
houseguest"?\\
292 - Mario.\\
293 - Yeah, he's going to be here three
more days.\\
294 - Well, you see, he got another job\\
295 - after Ricky told me to get rid of
him.\\
296 - So, now if Ricky finds him here,
he'll blow his Cuban cork!\\
297 - Nice to be alone, huh?\\
298 - Sure is.\\
299 - Well, let's see now.\\
300 - Mario's been gone for two days.\\
301 - He should be halfway to San
Francisco.\\
302 - He should be.\\
303 - Well, I gotta go to work, dear.\\
304 - I'll see you later.\\
305 - All right, sweetheart.\\
306 - Good-bye.\\
307 - Bye, doll.\\
308 - Mrs. Ricardo?\\
309 - Yes?\\
310 - Bureau of Immigration.\\
311 - Do you know a Mario Orsatti?\\
312 - Come in.\\
313 - Yes, sir. Why?\\
314 - Is he here?\\
315 - Here? No, he isn't here.\\
316 - Anything wrong?\\
317 - I understand for the past two days,\\
318 - he's been working at Martinelli's
Pizza Parlor.\\
319 - That's right.\\
320 - Well, I was just over there, and it
isn't opened yet.\\
321 - No, not now.
Well, you see,\\
322 - Mario Orsatti entered this country on
a visitor's visa.\\
323 - Visitors are not allowed to work.\\
324 - So, if your friend has violated the
law,\\
325 - he may have to be deported.\\
326 - Deported?\\
327 - Oh, you couldn't do a thing like
that.\\
328 - Oh, oh, Mario didn't know he was
breaking the law.\\
329 - Honest, he didn't, and I didn't
either.\\
330 - You see, he was just working to get a
little money\\
331 - so he could go visit his brother in
San Francisco,\\
332 - and that's the truth, the whole truth\\
333 - and nothing but the truth, so help
me, Your Honor.\\
334 - We try to be lenient in these cases.\\
335 - However, Mrs. Ricardo,\\
336 - under no circumstances is Orsatti to
continue working.\\
337 - Even for one more day?\\
338 - Not without a work permit.\\
339 - And it'll take him at least 90 days
to get one.\\
340 - I, uh, trust that you'll see he'll
get this information?\\
341 - Oh, yes, sir.\\
342 - Yes, sir, I'll, I'll tell him, and
thank you, sir.\\
343 - That's quite all right. Good-bye.\\
344 - Good-bye.\\
345 - Ethel, Ethel,\\
346 - could I see you in the kitchen for a
moment, please?\\
347 - Please!\\
348 - This time Mario go in the kitchen.\\
349 - Okay.\\
350 - What's up?\\
351 - We're in a terrible jam.\\
352 - A man from the Immigration Bureau\\
353 - just told me that if Mario works one
more day,\\
354 - he's gonna Deported!	       be
deported.\\
355 - Yeah, it's the law.\\
356 - Visitors can't work without a permit.\\
357 - So we can't let him go back to that
pizza place.\\
358 - Lucy!\\
359 - If Mario ever finds out that he broke
the law\\
360 - he won't even accept the two days
salary\\
361 - that's coming to him.\\
362 - So we mustn't let him know.\\
363 - Well, how are we gonna get his money?\\
364 - Well... I could go down and pick it
up\\
365 - if you'll stay with Little Ricky\\
366 - when he comes home from school.\\
367 - I will.\\
368 - Let's see now, he's got two days
salary coming.\\
369 - Bus fare...\\
370 - I'll make up the rest out of my
allowance.\\
371 - That's good. Mario doesn't have to
know anything about it.\\
372 - Okay, all right.\\
373 - Uh, Mario?\\
374 - Ma...\\
375 - Si, senora?
Uh, Mario...\\
376 - Uh, Mr. Martinelli just called\\
377 - and said that-that you don't have to
go to work today.\\
378 - No work? How come no work?\\
379 - Well, um...
it's a new labor law.\\
380 - Uh, you see, when you, when you start
a new job,\\
381 - you work two days, and then you get
the third day off...\\
382 - with pay.\\
383 - That's-a the law?\\
384 - Yep. What's the name of that new law,
Ethel?\\
385 - I don't know. You're the labor expert
around here.\\
386 - It's called the, um...\\
387 - "The Taft-Hartley Visitors From Italy\\
388 - "Who Work In Pizzerias\\
389 - Get Every Third Day Off Amendment."\\
390 - My goodness.\\
391 - America, she's a great country.\\
392 - Yes.\\
393 - Uh, Mario, as long as you don't have
to go to work,\\
394 - why don't you relax.\\
395 - Just sit around and rest up for your
bus trip tomorrow, huh?\\
396 - Yeah, that's a good idea.\\
397 - And I'll go down and pick up your
pay.\\
398 - Oh, you such lovely people.\\
399 - Table, senora?\\
400 - Uh, I'd like to see Mr. Martinelli,
please.\\
401 - Si, senora.
I'll get him.\\
402 - You wanted to see me?\\
403 - Mr. Martinelli?
Yes.\\
404 - Mr. Martinelli, I'm Mrs. Ricardo,\\
405 - where Mario is staying?\\
406 - Yes?
Well, Mario is very sick\\
407 - and he won't be able to come back and
work anymore.\\
408 - So, I came over to pick up his two
days salary.\\
409 - Oh, no.\\
410 - What do you mean "Oh, no"?\\
411 - I made a deal with Mario to work
three days.\\
412 - He works three days or no pay.\\
413 - Well, that doesn't seem very fair.\\
414 - Look, the pizza chef\\
415 - is getting off in five minutes.\\
416 - If Mario is not here to relieve him,
no pay.\\
417 - Uh, uh, Mr. Martinelli,\\
418 - uh, if I, if I could find a
substitute for Mario,\\
419 - will you pay the money?\\
420 - Well, it all depends.\\
421 - Who are you going to get?\\
422 - Well, um...\\
423 - I know a pizza specialist.\\
424 - Who?\\
425 - Me.\\
426 - You?\\
427 - Yes.\\
428 - You know how to make pizza?\\
429 - Yes. Yes, I majored in pizza\\
430 - in my high school cooking class.\\
431 - Yeah, I make all kinds.\\
432 - Uh, you see, people from Rome\\
433 - write me for my pizza recipe.\\
434 - I'll give you a cap and an apron.\\
435 - Two pizzas.\\
436 - Here you are, Miss.\\
437 - Thank you.\\
438 - One pizza,\\
439 - mushroom and sausage!\\
440 - Oh, I'm a little rusty.\\
441 - Hurry up with my pizza!\\
442 - Oh, he's wonderful, isn't he?\\
443 - Oh, he's sweet.\\

445 - Hi, son.\\
446 - Where's Lucy?\\
447 - Oh, Ricky, let's go over to your
apartment\\

460 - Come here.\\
461 - Start back at the beginning\\
462 - and tell me the whole story.\\

465 - What do you think you're doing?\\
466 - Well?\\
467 - No speak-a de English.\\

pusiera\\

la senora aqui.\\
474 - Look what you...!\\

Estupida!\\

the club,\\

483 - burned-out pizza oven.\\
484 - $210.33.\\

number on my chest.\\
486 - Hi. Well, that's that.\\
487 - You get him on the bus?\\
488 - Yep. He's on his way to San
Francisco.\\

out.\\
490 - Senor Ricardo?\\

1 - Hi, honey.\\
2 - Hi. What are you ringing the bell
for?\\
3 - I couldn't find my key.\\
4 - Don't tell me you lost your key
again.\\
5 - Certainly not.
I haven't lost it.\\
6 - I just couldn't find it.\\
7 - That's the third key that you've lost
in one month.\\
8 - Now, honey, let's not fight.\\
9 - You're leaving tonight.\\
10 - We're going to be separated for three
whole days.\\
11 - Let's not spoil our last few hours
together.\\
12 - All right, all right.\\
13 - Hi, Mommy.\\
14 - Hello, sweetie pie.\\
15 - Well, what have we here?\\
16 - I caught a fish.\\
17 - Well, I'll say you did.\\
18 - You're getting ready for Florida,
huh?\\
19 - Uh-huh.\\
20 - Mommy?\\
21 - What, darling?\\
22 - Why aren't you going fishing with us?\\
23 - Well, just the men in the family are
going fishing, honey.\\
24 - You and Uncle Fred and Daddy are
going.\\
25 - Mommy and Aunt Ethel are going\\
26 - to meet you down there in about three
days.\\
27 - Oh, boy! We're gonna have fun!\\
28 - You bet you're gonna have fun.\\
29 - Say, you bought a lot of stuff,
didn't you?\\
30 - Well, honey, you don't want me to
look tacky.\\
31 - After all, you and your band are
appearing\\
32 - at the Eden Roc Hotel.\\
33 - Well, well.\\
34 - Honey, I bought you a lot of things
for Florida, too.\\
35 - Look at this.\\
36 - See? You wear this on the boat.\\
37 - There you are, Commodore.\\
38 - Mommy bought you a bathing suit.\\
39 - That's mine.\\
40 - Yours?\\
41 - Relax. It stretches when it's on.\\
42 - See that it does.\\
43 - Ricky, look at this, honey.\\
44 - For a great big boy\\
45 - who's going on a trip with his daddy,\\
46 - he has just got to have a wallet.\\
47 - Oh, boy! Thanks.
What's it for?\\
48 - Oh, well, honey, it's to keep things
in.\\
49 - You know, like money and pictures\\
50 - and valuable things that you don't
want to lose.\\
51 - See? It's just like Daddy's.\\
52 - Just like Daddy's, there won't be
money in it.\\
53 - Oh, push-tush.\\
54 - Well, let me see now.\\
55 - You're going on the Sunshine Limited.\\
56 - You leave Penn Station Thursday at
2:00.\\
57 - We'll meet you at the station in
North Miami.\\
58 - Okay.\\
59 - Now, make sure that you put these\\
60 - in a place that you don't lose them.\\
61 - Honey, sometimes you treat me just
like a child.\\
62 - Have I ever lost any train tickets
before?\\
63 - Yes.\\
64 - Have I ever lost any train tickets\\
65 - to Florida before?\\
66 - We've never been to Florida before.\\
67 - There you are.\\
68 - Look, from here on, they're your
responsibility.\\
69 - Well, honey, don't worry about them.\\
70 - I'm going to put them right over here\\
71 - where I know where they are.
Okay.\\
72 - There they are!\\
73 - Well, maybe they'd be a lot safer
over there.\\
74 - Yeah. If I ever lost them, I'd never
hear the end of it.\\
75 - Maybe you'd better use my wallet,
Mommy.\\
76 - Oh, no, honey.
Now, that's just for you.\\
77 - I'll leave them right here in the
desk.\\
78 - I know they'll be perfectly safe in
there.\\
79 - Well, maybe there's a better place.\\
80 - Let's see.\\
81 - Good morning.\\
82 - Hi.\\
83 - What's the matter?\\
84 - Now, Ethel, don't get panicky.\\
85 - Now, Ethel, don't get panicky.
I'll find them.\\
86 - Lucy! Don't tell me you've lost our
train tickets.\\
87 - Don't get panicky, Ethel.\\
88 - Ethel?
What?\\
89 - Get panicky.\\
90 - Oh, Lucy, of all the stupid things to
do.\\
91 - Oh, if Ricky finds out about this,
he'll kill me.\\
92 - Not this time he won't.\\
93 - I intend to do the job myself.\\
94 - Now, Ethel, don't get excited.\\
95 - Look, all I have to do is call him on
the telephone\\
96 - and tell him to wire me some more
money.\\
97 - Oh, yeah, that'll be great, except
for one thing.\\
98 - What's that?\\
99 - They're out on a boat where they
can't be reached.\\
100 - Oh, darn it.\\
101 - Honestly, Lucy.\\
102 - Well, maybe we have enough to buy two
more train tickets.\\
103 - How much money did Fred leave you?\\
104 - $18 and a half a sheet of Green
Stamps.\\
105 - Well, let's see now.\\
106 - I have... $32 and 24.... cents.\\
107 - That's over $50.\\
108 - That's not nearly enough for two
train fares to Florida.\\
109 - Oh.\\
110 - Well, um... is it enough for one
train fare and...\\
111 - and one half-fare\\
112 - for a very large, blond, chubby
child?\\
113 - It is not.\\
114 - Well, maybe one of us could go.\\
115 - Which one?\\
116 - The one of us that...\\
117 - that has a little child down there\\
118 - that needs her?\\
119 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
120 - Either we both go to Florida or
nobody goes.\\
121 - All right, all right.\\
122 - There must be some way for both of us
to get down there.\\
123 - Okay. How?\\
124 - Well...\\
125 - I know! By sharing a ride!\\
126 - Sharing a ride?\\
127 - Sure. In a car.\\
128 - You know, people are always looking
for passengers\\
129 - to share the cost of gas and stuff.\\
130 - Here they are.
Now, let's see.\\
131 - Here's one.\\
132 - La-la-la-la!\\
133 - Mrs. Ricardo, you were right.\\
134 - You two don't take up any more room
than one.\\
135 - No, it's, it's really quite roomy.\\
136 - Isn't it, Ethel?\\
137 - Oh, roomy isn't the word for it.\\
138 - In fact, the word for it is cramped.\\
139 - Mrs. Grundy, uh, I'm getting a little
hungry.\\
140 - So am I.\\
141 - After all, we have been on the road\\
142 - since 6:30 this morning.\\
143 - Well, we've got to push on\\
144 - if we're going to get to Florida in
2? days.\\
145 - Well, I know, but it's 1:30 already,\\
146 - and don't you think we'd better start\\
147 - looking for a place to eat?\\
148 - We can't stop and dawdle for things
like lunch.\\
149 - Well, aren't you ever gonna stop and
eat?\\
150 - Oh! Didn't I tell you to pack a
lunch?\\
151 - No, you didn't tell us to pack a
lunch.\\
152 - We thought we'd stop along the road.\\
153 - All you'll find on the road are hot
dog and hamburger stands.\\
154 - Well, what's that you're eating?\\
155 - It's a watercress sandwich.\\
156 - Well, I guess you wouldn't find\\
157 - too many watercress sandwich stands\\
158 - along the road.\\
159 - Care to try one?\\
160 - No, I don't...
I'd love to!\\
161 - Help yourself.\\
162 - Oh, thank you.
Thank you!\\
163 - Oh... boy.\\
164 - There you are, Lucy.\\
165 - Like it?\\
166 - Not bad.
Not bad at all.\\
167 - Very tasty... if you like buttered
grass.\\
168 - I love buttered grass.\\
169 - All right.\\
170 - Beddy-bye, everyone.\\
171 - What are we stopping here for?\\
172 - I don't see any motel.\\
173 - Who needs a motel?\\
174 - What do you mean?\\
175 - Didn't I tell you to bring a
sleeping bag?\\
176 - No, you didn't tell us to bring a
sleeping bag.\\
177 - Look, Mrs. Grundy, if there's
anything else\\
178 - you forgot to tell us, please tell us
now.\\
179 - Listen to me, Missy.\\
180 - If you're going to get testy,\\
181 - you can just get out and walk the
rest of the way.\\
182 - You've got our money.\\
183 - Exactly.\\
184 - Nighty-night!\\
185 - Well, uh, where are we supposed to
sleep?\\
186 - Well, the car is very comfortable.\\
187 - Let's see, now.
It's, uh, it's 12:30.\\
188 - I'd like to be on the road at 4:00 in
the morning. Yoo-hoo!\\
189 - You want the upper or the lower?\\
190 - And now for your early
morning edition of the news.\\
191 - Evelyn Holmby, gray-haired hatchet
murderess\\
192 - whose spectacular escape\\
193 - from the New York State Prison for
Women\\
194 - three days ago astounded the nation,\\
195 - is still at large.\\
196 - Police are tracking down reports
that...\\
197 - Where are we?\\
198 - South Carolina.\\
199 - What happened to North Carolina?\\
200 - Hey, we must have traveled over 200
miles this morning.\\
201 - Sure have.\\
202 - I always take the back roads.\\
203 - You make much better time on them.\\
204 - Oh.
Oh.\\
205 - What's that?
What's that?\\
206 - Oh!\\
207 - Oh, boy! She's flat all right.\\
208 - Whew! She sure is.\\
209 - Flat as a pancake.\\
210 - Please.\\
211 - Do you have to mention food?\\
212 - Well, I guess this is a chance for me
to catch a little catnap.\\
213 - A nap? Now?\\
214 - Who's gonna change the tire?\\
215 - Well, after all, I've been doing all
the driving.\\
216 - I'm sure you two wouldn't mind
changing a tire.\\
217 - You'll find everything you
need in the trunk.\\
218 - I hope we find a mechanic back there.\\
219 - I don't know anything about changing
a tire.\\
220 - I do. I watched Ricky and Fred\\
221 - on our trip to California.\\
222 - It's a cinch.
It is?\\
223 - Whew!\\
224 - Well, she's got a lot of gadgets in
here.\\
225 - Yep. There's a hammer.\\
226 - Here's sort of a bent-looking thing.\\
227 - Yeah. Here's a...
a hatchet.\\
228 - I wonder what she does with this.\\
229 - Oh, didn't I
tell you to bring a hatchet along?\\
230 - We might have to chop our way through
the Everglades.\\
231 - I got to get this tire out of here.\\
232 - Okay.\\
233 - There. Now, let's see.\\
234 - You'd better get the jack out of the
back.\\
235 - All right.\\
236 - Oh, dear.\\
237 - Lucy...
What?\\
238 - what does a jack look like?\\
239 - Oh, Ethel, you're such a dumb bunny.\\
240 - Anybody knows what a jack looks like.\\
241 - It's a... It's a...\\
242 - with a...\\
243 - Lucy.\\
244 - What?\\
245 - I don't see any...\\
246 - with a... back here.\\
247 - Oh, Ethel.\\
248 - There it is.\\
249 - That isn't a... with a...\\
250 - All right, so it's a... with a...\\
251 - That's it, huh?\\
252 - It couldn't be anything else.\\
253 - Gosh, you're smart.\\
254 - I'm not so smart.
I'm just observant.\\
255 - What do you do now?\\
256 - Put it under the car and pump it up.\\
257 - Oh. Where under the car do you put
it?\\
258 - Just anywhere.\\
259 - Oh, dear.\\
260 - There.\\
261 - Now.\\
262 - Is it moving?\\
263 - Not a bit.\\
264 - Come here and help me.\\
265 - Okay.\\
266 - What do I do now?\\
267 - Now just pump steady.
Just-just steady.\\
268 - Okay.\\
269 - There. Now.
Oh!\\
270 - Now it's getting harder.\\
271 - Yeah.\\
272 - Yeah.\\
273 - Is it supposed to do that?\\
274 - No, it isn't supposed
to do that.\\
275 - It's her fault for having such thin
fenders.\\
276 - What do we do now, Lucy?\\
277 - Let the jack down.\\
278 - Let it down, huh?\\
279 - Good heavens.\\
280 - Okay. All right.\\
281 - Not yet. Not yet.\\
282 - There. Now we got it.\\
283 - Getting it?\\
284 - Yeah.\\
285 - There. She'll never know the
difference.\\
286 - Lucy.
What?\\
287 - You must have put the jack in the
wrong place.\\
288 - No kidding.\\
289 - There. Now it's off the ground.\\
290 - Oh, good.\\
291 - Hey, look, Lucy!
What?\\
292 - It's not flat anymore.\\
293 - Oh, dear.\\
294 - Mira que cosa loca la goma esta!\\
295 - Mira que cosa loca la goma esta!\\
296 - What are you doing that for?\\
297 - That's what Ricky always does when he
changes a tire.\\
298 - Mira que cosa loca la goma esta!\\
299 - See? It works.\\
300 - Hey, no wonder it wouldn't come off.\\
301 - It's screwed on.\\
302 - Oh, yeah.\\
303 - Well, maybe that's what this thing is
for.\\
304 - You think so?\\
305 - Yeah. See?
It's all groovy.\\
306 - Oh. Okay.\\
307 - Oh!\\
308 - Lucy!
Whoa!\\
309 - Lucy! Oh!\\
310 - Oh, honey...\\
311 - You'd better hold the tire.\\
312 - Yeah, I'd better hold it, huh?\\
313 - Good girl.\\
314 - Hey, how about this?\\
315 - We changed a tire all by ourselves,
huh, girl?\\
316 - That's something, huh?
Yeah.\\
317 - Too bad we can't tell Ricky and Fred
about it.\\
318 - They'd never believe it anyway.\\
319 - They wouldn't, would they?
No.\\
320 - Well, there we are.\\
321 - Okay.\\
322 - I would say that is a good job well
done.\\
323 - What happened?!\\
324 - Lucy, we put the same tire back on we
took off.\\
325 - No!\\
326 - Mira que cosa loca la goma esta!\\
327 - Oh, it's five minutes to 4:00.\\
328 - Lucy, did you sleep at all?\\
329 - Who can sleep with all that noise?\\
330 - Sounds like feeding time in a pet
shop.\\
331 - Wouldn't you know she'd park us\\
332 - right in the middle of the
Everglades.\\
333 - Maybe some music will lull us to
sleep.\\
334 - Well, let's try it.\\
335 - Okay.\\
336 - Now here's the latest
bulletin on the Evelyn Holmby case.\\
337 - Police have definitely established
that Evelyn Holmby,\\
338 - famous gray-haired hatchet murderess
who escaped\\
339 - from New York State Prison Thursday,
is heading south\\
340 - in a cream-colored convertible coupe.\\
341 - Stand by for further bulletins.\\
342 - And now back to our recorded music.\\
343 - What did you turn it off for?\\
344 - Did you hear what he said?\\
345 - Yeah. So what?\\
346 - Which way are we heading?\\
347 - South.\\
348 - Exactly.\\
349 - Gray-haired...\\
350 - Cream-colored convertible...\\
351 - Oh, Lucy, that's just a coincidence.\\
352 - But think.
It all fits.\\
353 - Likes to drive in the dark.\\
354 - Won't stop at motels.\\
355 - Uses back roads.\\
356 - Just why do you suppose, she uses
back roads?\\
357 - She told us.
To save time.\\
358 - Oh, sure. She uses back roads to
avoid the police.\\
359 - Oh, Lucy, I don't believe it.\\
360 - The woman they're looking for is a
hatchet murderess.\\
361 - She doesn't look like a...\\
362 - Hatchet!
Hatchet!\\
363 - We're just jumping to conclusions.\\
364 - She brought that hatchet along to,
uh...\\
365 - to, uh...\\
366 - To what?\\
367 - Chop watercress?!\\
368 - Ethel, that woman definitely has a
criminal face.\\
369 - She's really that Evelyn Holmby\\
370 - the police are looking for.\\
371 - No!\\
372 - Yes! So we got to make a break for
it. Come on.\\
373 - In the middle of a swamp?\\
374 - What difference does it make?\\
375 - Come on, let's get out of here.\\
376 - Up!\\
377 - 4:00, and time to hit the road.\\
378 - What do we do now?\\
379 - I don't know, but whatever you do,
don't fall asleep.\\
380 - Fall asleep? Oh!\\
381 - Well, it won't be long now.\\
382 - That winds up the news
from Washington today.\\
383 - And here's the latest bulletin on
Evelyn Holmby,\\
384 - escaped hatchet murderess.\\
385 - Police have learned that, before
leaving New York,\\
386 - she dyed her gray hair red, and is
heading south\\
387 - with a blonde companion.\\
388 - What are you doing?
What are you doing?\\
389 - Oh, I was just admiring your lovely
red hair.\\
390 - Is it dyed?\\
391 - Dyed?\\
392 - Who died?\\
393 - My hair!\\
394 - Of course it isn't dyed.\\
395 - It's very pretty.\\
396 - Lucy, we got to call the police.\\
397 - How are we going to get her to stop?\\
398 - What are you two muttering about?\\
399 - Oh, nothing, nothing.\\
400 - I... I... I just remembered that I...\\
401 - I... I left the water running in my
bathtub\\
402 - before I left New York.\\
403 - I've got to stop someplace and call
my landlady.\\
404 - I thought you said she was your
landlady.\\
405 - Oh, yeah.\\
406 - Landlady, my tub's running over.\\
407 - I've just remembered that I...
I've got to stop, too.\\
408 - I've got to make a...
a phone call.\\
409 - There's a place up there.\\
410 - Where's the phone?\\
411 - No, let her go.\\
412 - It's a very important phone call.\\
413 - No, no, no.\\
414 - Sorry, ladies.\\
415 - That phone's out of order.\\
416 - Coffee, ladies?\\
417 - Coffee?
Yeah.\\
418 - Yeah, let's have some coffee.\\
419 - Let's have a cup of coffee, huh?\\
420 - Have some coffee.\\
421 - Here. We won't need these.\\
422 - Pfft! Pfft!\\
423 - Y'all must be from the north.\\
424 - New York.\\
425 - New York. Yeah.
Heading south.\\
426 - South.\\
427 - All three of us--\\
428 - me, this redhead and this blonde.\\
429 - You notice how gray her hair is?\\
430 - Care for some more coffee?\\
431 - Um...\\
432 - Yes. I'd like a second help-ing.\\
433 - Help-ing.\\
434 - When will your telephone be fixed?\\
435 - First thing tomorrow morning.\\
436 - Oh.\\
437 - I've got to fetch something out of
the car.\\
438 - I'll be right back!\\
439 - She's going out to get the hatchet!\\
440 - She's the hatchet murderer!\\
441 - She's the one that escaped!\\
442 - Yeah. The police are looking for her.
How can we get\\
443 - in touch with the police?
Now, calm yourself, ma'am.\\
444 - They just caught that hatchet lady in
Kentucky.\\
445 - They did?
They did?\\
446 - Yeah. I just heard it on the radio\\
447 - 'fore y'all came in.\\
448 - Oh.\\
449 - You and your wild ideas.\\
450 - Well...\\
451 - Oh, I feel terrible.\\
452 - Just terrible.\\
453 - You're going to feel a lot worse.\\
454 - She just drove off without us.\\
455 - No!\\
456 - Why do you suppose she did that?\\
457 - I don't know.\\
458 - Thank goodness she threw our
suitcases off before she left.\\
459 - A lot of good that will do us.\\
460 - How are we going to get from here to
Miami?\\
461 - Well, how's your right thumb?\\
462 - Oh...\\
463 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
464 - I'm not going to hitchhike all the
way to Miami.\\
465 - It's either that or walk,\\
466 - and I think it's about 100 miles.\\
467 - Did you hear that, thumb?\\
468 - Get going.\\
469 - Oh, honestly.\\
470 - I might have known, if I listened to
you,\\
471 - I'd end up hitchhiking to Florida.\\
472 - Well, we got here, didn't we?\\
473 - Yeah, on a poultry truck with 85 live
chickens.\\
474 - You'll have to admit it beat walking.\\
475 - A few more feathers and I could have
flown.\\
476 - Remember, now.
When the boys get here,\\
477 - tell them we came in on the train,\\
478 - and... and they'll never know what
happened.\\
479 - I'm not sure I know what happened
myself.\\
480 - Here they come.\\
481 - Here they come.\\
482 - Oh, hi, dear!
Ha, ha!\\
483 - Oh, I missed you!\\
484 - Hello, honey.
How are you?\\
485 - Hi, sweetheart.\\
486 - Did you have a nice trip?\\
487 - Oh, it was fabulous.\\
488 - Just fabulous.
Wasn't it, Ethel?\\
489 - Oh, that's what it was-- just
fabulous.\\
490 - I don't think this warm weather\\
491 - agrees with you, honeybunch.\\
492 - You're molting.\\
493 - Sweetie pie. I sure missed you,
honey.\\
494 - Well, thank you, dear.\\
495 - Listen... uh...\\
496 - there's a couple of things\\
497 - that I'd like you to 'splain.\\
498 - What?\\
499 - Well, first of all,\\
500 - how come you got here an hour before
the train?\\
501 - Huh?\\
502 - I just checked.
The train is an hour late.\\
503 - It is?\\
504 - Yeah.\\
505 - And another thing--\\
506 - how come you got here without any
tickets?\\
507 - I just, uh, found your tickets\\
508 - in Little Ricky's wallet.\\
509 - You what?!\\
510 - You said you wanted them in a safe
place, Mommy.\\
511 - Well, so I did, honey.\\
512 - I did tell him that...\\
513 - How did you get here?\\
514 - It's a long story.\\
515 - How did we get here?\\
516 - "I Love Lucy"\\
517 - starring Lucille Ball\\
518 - and Desi Arnaz\\
519 - has been presented for your pleasure\\
520 - by Instant Sanka,\\
521 - the hardy coffee you can drink as
strong as you like,\\
522 - it still can't affect your nerves.
\subsection {Episode 07: Deep Sea Fishing (1956)}
1 - Boy, what lousy luck.\\
2 - Everybody on the ocean was catching
fish but us.\\
3 - Yeah, well, Fred,\\
4 - it's not important how many fish you
catch.\\
5 - It's the sport that counts.\\
6 - You believe that?\\
7 - Well, no...\\
8 - but it helps to say it\\
9 - when you haven't caught anything\\
10 - in a couple of days.
I see.\\
11 - Hey, there's a note here from Lucy.\\
12 - "Ethel and I have gone shopping for
beach clothes."\\
13 - What, again?
Beach clothes. Beach clothes.\\
14 - That's all they think about.\\
15 - You know something?
I think I got an idea\\
16 - how to keep them from going shopping.\\
17 - How?\\
18 - Well, the next time we go fishing,\\
19 - we'll take the girls with us.\\
20 - Are you crazy?\\
21 - The fish aren't biting as it is.\\
22 - Why antagonize them further?\\
23 - Take your choice.\\
24 - You're either going to take Ethel
fishing with you,\\
25 - or you're going to let her run wild
in the shops.\\
26 - Well...\\
27 - She might easily spend over $100.\\
28 - Welcome aboard, Ethel.\\
29 - I thought you'd see it my way.\\
30 - I'm going to get out of these
clothes.\\
31 - And I'm going to take a little nap.\\
32 - Ricky?\\
33 - It's all right, Ethel.\\
34 - He's taking a shower. Come on.\\
35 - Oh, Lucy...\\
36 - when Fred sees all this stuff I
bought, he'll kill me.\\
37 - Oh...\\
38 - Oh, now, Ethel, pull yourself
together.\\
39 - Come on. Hey, hide your packages in
here.\\
40 - Can I, honey?
Yeah.\\
41 - Oh, thanks.\\
42 - I don't know what came over me.\\
43 - I walked in that store and I saw all
those beautiful things\\
44 - and I just got drunk with power.\\
45 - I know. I got a little plastered
myself.\\
46 - I spent $68!\\
47 - Let's see.\\
48 - That's my clothing allowance for the
next eight weeks.\\
49 - I spent $72!\\
50 - How many weeks allowance is that for
you?\\
51 - I should live so long!\\
52 - How are we gonna tell the fellas\\
53 - we bought all this stuff?\\
54 - I don't know, but we're gonna have\\
55 - to break it to them gently.\\
56 - Whoo!\\
57 - Hey!\\
58 - I think I'm getting an idea.\\
59 - Well, encourage it.
I'm desperate!\\
60 - How's this?\\
61 - The next time the boys go fishing,\\
62 - we'll insist on going along.\\
63 - Oh, Lucy, what are you talking about?\\
64 - They'll never take us with them.\\
65 - Exactly. They'll refuse.\\
66 - So...?\\
67 - So, we'll say, "Well, if we can't go
fishing,\\
68 - we'll go shopping."\\
69 - And then when they come back,\\
70 - we'll show them all those packages,\\
71 - and they won't be able to say a word
about it.\\
72 - What do you think?\\
73 - In spite of what I think,\\
74 - let's do it.
Okay.\\
75 - When are you going to tell them\\
76 - we're going fishing with them?\\
77 - I think they're going in the morning.\\
78 - Let's tell them right now.
Go get Fred.\\
79 - Okay.\\
80 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
81 - Hi. How was the fishing? Any luck?\\
82 - Terrible. Not a bite.
Oh...\\
83 - I think our boat is a yinx.\\
84 - Oh, ho-ho! Of course your boat isn't
a "yinx."\\
85 - Well, something is wrong someplace.\\
86 - Come on, come on.\\
87 - Oh, man, can't even get a
chance to take a nap.\\
88 - What are you dragging me over here
for?\\
89 - I told you!\\
90 - Lucy wants to talk to you.\\
91 - Well, we were just thinking...\\
92 - You know, uh, Ethel and I aren't
getting\\
93 - the most out of this trip.\\
94 - After all, how much of Florida\\
95 - can you see from the inside of a
store?\\
96 - So, we decided that the next time\\
97 - you go fishing, we'd like to go
along.\\
98 - You want to go fishing with us?\\
99 - Yeah. Unless, of course, for some
reason or other,\\
100 - you don't want us to go along.\\
101 - Then I suppose we could spend some
more time\\
102 - in those stale shops.\\
103 - Oh, no, no!
We want you to.\\
104 - Well, I think it's a wonderful
idea.\\
105 - You do?\\
106 - Yeah!\\
107 - You don't think it's a wonderful
idea,\\
108 - do you, Fred?\\
109 - Honeybunch, I think it's swell.\\
110 - Fred, you know me.\\
111 - You know how I get on water.\\
112 - I'll be hungry and thirsty and
cranky.\\
113 - What's your excuse on dry land?\\
114 - But what husband wants his wife along\\
115 - on a fishing trip?\\
116 - We do!\\
117 - And besides that, it was you who
suggested it.\\
118 - Yeah!\\
119 - Yeah.\\
120 - Yeah, so I did.\\
121 - And I think it's a wonderful
suggestion.\\
122 - You might turn out to be a great
fishermen.\\
123 - Yeah. You might even catch something.\\
124 - Yeah! I'll bet they-they catch the
biggest fish\\
125 - on the whole trip.\\
126 - Right!\\
127 - I'll bet we could at that.\\
128 - I'll bet you could, too, honey.\\
129 - I mean a real bet.\\
130 - The women against the men.\\
131 - We'll bet you that we'll catch a
bigger fish than you two.\\
132 - Well, you want to make it
interesting?\\
133 - Yeah!\\
134 - All right. How much you want to bet?\\
135 - Uh, 68 and, uh...\\
136 - 72, uh...\\
137 - $140, plus tax.\\
138 - Huh?\\
139 - Well, make it 150 even.\\
140 - That'll be, um, $75 apiece.\\
141 - Lucy...\\
142 - Uh, where are you gonna get the money
to pay if you lose?\\
143 - Out of our clothing allowance.\\
144 - Lucy, could I see you in the hall for
a minute?\\
145 - Now, don't worry, Ethel.\\
146 - Ricky, you were saying\\
147 - that your boat was a jinx?\\
148 - Well, now, just so Ethel and I don't
get jinxed, too,\\
149 - what say we have a boat of our own?\\
150 - Okay with you, Fred?\\
151 - Okay? It's perfect.\\
152 - Well, I'll see that the
hotel gets\\
153 - a different boat for you two in the
morning.\\
154 - Oh, fine. Well, then, it's all
settled.\\
155 - Yup. I'll go get dressed.\\
156 - And I'll take another crack at that
nap.\\
157 - Yes, sir.\\
158 - Are you out of your mind?\\
159 - We don't know a thing about fishing!\\
160 - We won't lose a thing, Ethel.\\
161 - I have a plan.\\
162 - Now, look...
I'm still recuperating\\
163 - from your last plan.\\
164 - Oh, now, Ethel.\\
165 - Now here's what we're gonna do.\\
166 - Right after lunch, we're going out\\
167 - and buy the biggest fish we can find,\\
168 - and we're gonna have it here for
insurance\\
169 - in case we don't catch anything.\\
170 - Have it here?
Yeah.\\
171 - Where will we keep it?\\
172 - In the refrigerator here in the hotel
kitchen.\\
173 - Well, couldn't we get it in the
morning?\\
174 - You know how early they go fishing.\\
175 - There won't be time.\\
176 - Now, listen. I remember seeing a pier\\
177 - not far from here...\\
178 - Oh... careful.\\
179 - Ooh... oh...\\
180 - Oh!\\
181 - You and your hot ideas.\\
182 - Well, was it-- is it my fault\\
183 - if the chef didn't have any more room\\
184 - in the refrigerator?
Close the door.\\
185 - Go ahead, close it.\\
186 - Okay.\\
187 - And was it my fault there's a
convention here\\
188 - and he just made 2,000 ice-cream
molds\\
189 - in the shape of a shriner's hat?
Oh!\\
190 - Well, let's put it somewhere.\\
191 - Moby Dick is getting heavy.\\
192 - Well, we can't put it anyplace.\\
193 - We gotta hide it.\\
194 - Now, we gotta hide it before Little
Ricky\\
195 - comes home from the playground.\\
196 - I'd hate to have to explain this to
him.\\
197 - Why would you have to explain it?\\
198 - Isn't he used to having tuna around
the house?\\
199 - Oh, be quiet.\\
200 - Hold on a minute now.\\
201 - I'll see if I can get it in this
closet.\\
202 - All right.\\
203 - Oh, I can't put it in there with the
clothes.\\
204 - Oh, Lucy...\\
205 - Even if you find a place to hide it,\\
206 - you can't just keep a dead fish in
your room\\
207 - all night and all day tomorrow!\\
208 - But we gotta hide it.\\
209 - We can't let Ricky and Fred see it
now.\\
210 - Oh, great. We got a hot tuna on our
hands.\\
211 - Oh...\\
212 - Come on.\\
213 - I know. We'll put it in the bathtub.\\
214 - In the bathtub?\\
215 - Yeah. Help me get ahold of this
thing.\\
216 - All right.\\
217 - We'll pack it in ice cubes.\\
218 - All right.\\
219 - Hey, won't Ricky find it in there?\\
220 - Well, I'll draw the shower doors
around the tub.\\
221 - Okay.\\
222 - Come on.\\
223 - All right.\\
224 - Got it?\\
225 - Oh!\\
226 - Lucy?
What?\\
227 - What if Ricky wants to take a shower?\\
228 - One thing at a time.\\
229 - We'll worry about that when it
happens.\\
230 - Here, let me have it.\\
231 - Where are the fellas?\\
232 - They're at the Seaquarium taking
publicity pictures.\\
233 - They'll be gone for hours.\\
234 - Oh, that's good.\\
235 - Room service, please.\\
236 - Room service, this is Mrs. Ricardo in
919.\\
237 - I'd like some ice cubes, please.\\
238 - Oh... how many?\\
239 - About 4,000.\\
240 - No, I don't need any glasses.\\
241 - Well, you see, they're...
they're for the bathtub.\\
242 - The bathtub!\\
243 - I think I'd better come down and
explain.\\
244 - I'll be right down.\\
245 - Come on, Ethel.\\
246 - This explanation is gonna take two of
us.\\
247 - Okay.\\
248 - You and your great ideas.\\
249 - Buying a hundred-pound tuna\\
250 - in case we don't catch anything.\\
251 - I didn't want to take any chance\\
252 - on losing that 75 bucks.\\
253 - And you said the chef was gonna keep
it\\
254 - down in the refrigerator.\\
255 - I still think\\
256 - he was giving us a song-and-dance.\\
257 - Whoever heard of ice cream in the
shape of a shriner's hat?\\
258 - Did you see the wild look he gave us?\\
259 - Yeah. You'd think somebody came to
him\\
260 - with a hundred-pound tuna every five
minutes.\\
261 - Where are we gonna put this beast?\\
262 - Well, can't we put it in your
bathtub?\\
263 - Yeah, that's a good idea.\\
264 - Oh, my God, watch out, Ricky.\\
265 - Hey, wait a minute.
What?\\
266 - We can't put it in there.\\
267 - Why not?\\
268 - Lucy brings Little Ricky back from
the playground,\\
269 - she gives him a bath, she's sure to
find it in there.\\
270 - Oh, that's great.\\
271 - Let's put it in your tub.\\
272 - No, no, no, no, no.\\
273 - Suppose that Ethel wants to take a
bath?\\
274 - Listen, this was your idea.\\
275 - You'll think of something.
Let's go.\\
276 - Now, really!\\
277 - You'd think the Eden Roc Hotel\\
278 - would have 4,000 ice cubes on hand.\\
279 - Oh, sure.\\
280 - All the guests must keep fish in
their bathtubs.\\
281 - I'm going to see how our "guest" is
doing.\\
282 - How is he?\\
283 - He's resting comfortably.\\
284 - Never mind. Never mind.\\
285 - I'll go take a hot bath.\\
286 - Oh, hi.\\
287 - Good-good-bye, good-bye, Rick.\\
288 - Bye.\\
289 - Hi, dear.\\
290 - Oh, hi, honey, hi.\\
291 - How was the Seaquarium?\\
292 - Fine. Wonderful.\\
293 - We have to take Little Ricky there
sometime.\\
294 - Oh, yeah, that's good idea.\\
295 - How was your day?\\
296 - Fine... fine.\\
297 - That's good.\\
298 - Where are you going?\\
299 - I'm going to take a bath, dear.\\
300 - Take a bath?
In Miami Beach?\\
301 - Wow, with the whole Atlantic Ocean at
your doorstep?\\
302 - Oh, take a dip.
Take a dip, honey.\\
303 - It's much more refreshing.\\
304 - No, I don't want to take a dip.
I want this bath.\\
305 - Well, well, look, honey.\\
306 - Let me draw the water for you.\\
307 - A wife should do those things\\
308 - for her husband anyway, don't you
think?\\
309 - While I'm drawing the water for you,\\
310 - uh, why don't you go in there\\
311 - and-and find Little Ricky's red
swimming trunks.\\
312 - I promised to take them down to him
at the playground.\\
313 - Would you do that for me?\\
314 - All right.\\
315 - Ethel? Ethel?\\
316 - Yeah?\\
317 - You got a visitor.\\
318 - Honey, I can't find those swimming...\\
319 - What are you doing here? Where's
Lucy?\\
320 - I didn't see her.\\
321 - Wow! That was a close one.\\
322 - What are you talking about?\\
323 - The fish. Ethel had the gall to want
to take a bath,\\
324 - and when she went in the dressing
room,\\
325 - I sneaked the fish out of our tub\\
326 - and stuck him over there in your tub.\\
327 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
328 - What's the matter?\\
329 - Ay...\\
330 - Hi. Where'd you go to?\\
331 - I had to talk to Ethel for a minute.\\
332 - Oh.\\
333 - Uh... I couldn't find the trunks.\\
334 - Oh! He's wearing them.\\
335 - Oh.\\
336 - Ethel, I thought you were gonna take
a bath?\\
337 - Well, I, uh, I...
changed my mind.\\
338 - I thought you were gonna take a bath,
honey.\\
339 - Yeah, well, uh...
I changed my mind.\\
340 - Oh, well, if you're not gonna bathe,
I certainly am.\\
341 - All right.
Oh, wait, honey!\\
342 - You don't want to take a bath\\
343 - here in Miami Beach\\
344 - with the whole Atlantic Ocean at your
doorstep.\\
345 - Take a dip, dear.
Take a dip.\\
346 - I don't want to take a dip.
I want to take a bath.\\
347 - You can't.
Why not?\\
348 - Uh... the, uh, the...
the hot-water faucet is broken.\\
349 - So, I'll take a cold bath.\\
350 - It will be a terrible shock.\\
351 - You can say that again.\\
352 - The-the cold water makes you sick.\\
353 - It does not make me sick.\\
354 - Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah, I got to think of
your health, dear.\\
355 - If you want to take a bath, I insist
that you take a bath\\
356 - over at the Mertzes.\\
357 - I can't.\\
358 - Why not?\\
359 - Yeah. Why not?\\
360 - Okay, Ethel, let's go.\\
361 - Honey, you can't take a bath in our
tub\\
362 - with Tillie the tuna in there.\\
363 - I know it, but I gotta have a bath.\\
364 - I gotta get this fish off me.\\
365 - What are you gonna do?\\
366 - I'm gonna take an ice-cold shower in
our tub.\\
367 - Oh, fine. How are you gonna explain\\
368 - to the fellas that our tub is
occupied?\\
369 - I'm not going to explain to the
fellas.\\
370 - I'm going to get rid of them.\\
371 - And how are you gonna do that?\\
372 - I have a plan.
I have a plan.\\
373 - Well, I have!\\
374 - 919.\\
375 - What are you calling your room for?\\
376 - Now, Ethel, just relax.\\
377 - I know what I'm doing.\\
378 - Mr. Ricardo, this
is the manager's office.\\
379 - The manager would like to have you
and Mr. Mertz\\
380 - come down to the office right away.\\
381 - Thank you very much.\\
382 - What do you suppose the manager
wanted\\
383 - to talk to us about?\\
384 - Oh, probably stuff about the band or
something.\\
385 - Oh, I see.\\
386 - Just a minute.\\
387 - What's the matter with you?
Just a minute.\\
388 - Now, Ethel, everything's working out
very nicely.\\
389 - Oh, just peachy.\\
390 - You're gonna take an ice-cold shower,\\
391 - and I've got a hundred-pound fish in
my tub.\\
392 - Now get this through your head, Lucy.\\
393 - I am not going to keep that sea
monster\\
394 - in my bathtub overnight.\\
395 - All right, all right.\\
396 - We'll worry about that after I bathe.\\
397 - Now you go on back over there and
guard that bathroom.\\
398 - Fred will be back any minute.\\
399 - Uh...\\
400 - Ethel?\\
401 - What?\\
402 - You sure that fish is in your tub?\\
403 - Sure I'm sure.\\
404 - Hmm.\\
405 - You don't suppose\\
406 - he could've swum through the pipes\\
407 - from your tub back to ours, do you?\\
408 - What are you babbling about?\\
409 - The fish is in our tub.\\
410 - Oh, you poor little thing.\\
411 - I knew if you kept up this mad pace,\\
412 - sooner or later you'd crack up.\\
413 - Go see for yourself.\\
414 - Lucy...\\
415 - What?\\
416 - Do you suppose we've both cracked up?\\
417 - I don't know, Ethel.\\
418 - Now don't panic.
Don't panic. Don't panic.\\
419 - Now we're gonna sit down\\
420 - think this out calmly and rationally.\\
421 - Yeah.
Now look.\\
422 - Um, we brought the fish up here,
didn't we?\\
423 - Yeah, that's right.\\
424 - And then who took it over there?\\
425 - You did.\\
426 - I did. I took it over there...\\
427 - Are you sure that was the manager's
office that called?\\
428 - Sure I'm sure.\\
429 - Oh, you must have misunderstood.\\
430 - Look, Fred, I may speak with an
accent,\\
431 - but I don't listen with one.\\
432 - Yeah.\\
433 - Where are the girls?\\
434 - Lucy's probably still in the tub.\\
435 - Honey, I locked myself out of our
room.\\
436 - You got the key?\\
437 - That's funny.\\
438 - Lucy?\\
439 - Isn't Lucy in the tub?\\
440 - No... but guess who is.\\
441 - Ethel?\\
442 - No... but you're getting warmer.\\
443 - Quit playing games with me.
Who's in there?\\
444 - Is the tuna by any chance a flying
fish?\\
445 - No, no. What are you talking about?\\
446 - Go in there and look.\\
447 - Go. Go in there and look.\\
448 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
449 - Well?\\
450 - Well, what?\\
451 - If you put that fish in our tub,\\
452 - how did it get back into your tub?\\
453 - Oh, I don't know, but I'm sick and
tired\\
454 - of playing hide-and-seek with that
fish.\\
455 - Well, that makes two of us.\\
456 - What do you say we just forget\\
457 - this whole crazy scheme of yours,
huh?\\
458 - I'm with you.\\
459 - But how are we gonna get rid of our
friend in there?\\
460 - Well, we'll dump him someplace.\\
461 - There's a big trash can in that
service room.\\
462 - We'll just pick him up and dump him
in there.\\
463 - That way, our hands will be clean.\\
464 - Smelly but clean.\\
465 - Well, what are we gonna do now?\\
466 - Ethel, what say\\
467 - we get rid of the fish and call the
whole thing off?\\
468 - Oh, now you're talking sense.\\
469 - But what in the world are we gonna do
with it?\\
470 - I don't know.
We'll get rid of it\\
471 - if we have to get it a room.\\
472 - Get it a room?!\\
473 - All right, so we'll dump it down the
elevator shaft.\\
474 - Sheesh!\\
475 - What are you doing with that fish?\\
476 - Uh... what fish?\\
477 - That fish.\\
478 - Never mind this fish.\\
479 - What are you doing with that fish?\\
480 - I asked you first.\\
481 - Oh, yeah. So you did.\\
482 - While I'm thinking of an answer,\\
483 - you tell me what you're doing with
yours.\\
484 - Well, uh... Fred?\\
485 - What are we doing with this?\\
486 - Well, I wa...
I was...\\
487 - Well, that's not the point.\\
488 - Ethel, why did you get that?\\
489 - Yeah!\\
490 - Well...\\
491 - I know what you were gonna do with
that fish.\\
492 - You bought that fish\\
493 - and you were going to pretend\\
494 - that you caught it.\\
495 - What a sneaky thing to do.\\
496 - Well, you were gonna do the same
thing,\\
497 - so you're just as snicky as we are.\\
498 - Oh, you started the whole thing.\\
499 - That's right.
I did not start the whole thing.\\
500 - Yes, you did.
Yeah.\\
501 - What do you I started the whole...\\
502 - All right, all right, all right.\\
503 - All right, let's admit it.\\
504 - We're all guilty, but the bet's still
on.\\
505 - Tomorrow morning we're going fishing,\\
506 - but we'll all go on the same boat\\
507 - so there'll be no funny business.\\
508 - Understand?\\
509 - Mrs. Ricardo...\\
510 - what do you want me to do with these
4,000 ice cubes?\\
511 - Where do you want me to put them?\\
512 - Four hours and not a bite.\\
513 - Oh, be patient, Ethel.\\
514 - Just keep thinking about\\
515 - all those new clothes we're gonna
get.\\
516 - Hey, Rick, I'd better check my bait.\\
517 - Daddy, what if I catch the biggest
fish?\\
518 - If you catch the biggest fish, it
counts for our side.\\
519 - Oh, just a minute now.\\
520 - He's as much my child as he is yours,
you know.\\
521 - The bet was the men against the
women.\\
522 - We get credit for anything he
catches.\\
523 - That's right.\\
524 - You couldn't have had a girl child.\\
525 - Oh, no, you had to go and have a boy.\\
526 - Hey!\\
527 - I got a fish on mine.\\
528 - Hey, how about that?\\
529 - Take it off, Rick!
Take it off!\\
530 - Look at it, hey!\\
531 - Oh, come now.\\
532 - How about that?\\
533 - Oh, you call that a fish?\\
534 - Aah, your bait was bigger than that.\\
535 - Yeah, well, go ahead and laugh.\\
536 - Yeah, that's the biggest fish we've
caught.\\
537 - That's the biggest fish that's been
caught out here.\\
538 - That's right.
We're going back in 20 minutes.\\
539 - That's right. So far, that fish wins
the bet.\\
540 - Oh, we still got 20 minutes.
Yeah.\\
541 - I'm going to use one of those live
sardines in there.\\
542 - That's a good idea.\\
543 - Oh, I got a fish!\\
544 - Oh, you got one?
I got a fish!\\
545 - Put on your brake.\\
546 - I got a fish!
What?\\
547 - Put on your brake.
Hang on to it.\\
548 - Yeah, I got it.
Oh, it's a big one!\\
549 - Hang on, Mommy.\\
550 - Whose side are you on?\\
551 - Oh!
Hang on, honey.\\
552 - Oh, that's a good one.\\
553 - We're gonna win.\\
554 - We're gonna to win, Lucy.\\
555 - Oh, this has got to be the biggest
thing\\
556 - that was ever in the ocean.\\
557 - Come on.
Come on.
Yeah.\\
558 - Yeah.
Come on.
Hurry up.\\
559 - Ricky Ricardo!\\
560 - What have you done with my fish?!\\
561 - Come on, help him up.\\
562 - Come on, Rick.
Lost my big fish.\\
563 - Come on.
Come on.\\
564 - Give me your hand.\\
565 - Oh... Oh...\\
566 - Give me your hand.\\
567 - Are you wet?\\
568 - Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh, Rick!\\
569 - Now, now, it's your fault\\
570 - for getting all tangled up in my
line.\\
571 - It's my fault for getting tangled up
with you\\
572 - 15 years ago.\\
573 - What?!\\
574 - Let's go back to shore.\\
575 - Well, now, what about our bet?\\
576 - We won our bet.\\
577 - Oh...
This little baby\\
578 - just won papa 75 bucks.
Yeah.\\
579 - Thanks a lot, Lucy.\\
580 - Well, we can't win 'em all.\\
581 - What's the matter, Rick?\\
582 - What's the matter with you?\\
583 - What's the matter with you?!\\
584 - Let me help...\\
585 - What is...\\
586 - How about that?\\
587 - I caught a fish, too, Fred.\\
588 - Hey! Hey!\\
589 - Bigger than yours.
Yeah.\\
590 - That means that we won.\\
591 - What are you talking about?\\
592 - Because that fish was on you, and I
caught you!\\
593 - We won!
\subsection {Episode 08: Desert Island (1956)}
1 - Lucy?
Yeah?\\
2 - Fred just told me that he and Ricky
are gonna judge\\
3 - a bathing beauty contest this
afternoon.\\
4 - I know.\\
5 - How are we gonna stop them?\\
6 - We're not.
We're gonna let them do it.\\
7 - Honey, you've been in Florida too
long.\\
8 - Your poor little brain is sunburned.\\
9 - Not at all, Ethel, not at all.\\
10 - I just decided that for once,\\
11 - I'm was going to let Ricky do what he
wants to.\\
12 - When he told me about the contest\\
13 - I said, "Go ahead and do it, dear."\\
14 - You said that?\\
15 - Yes. This is the new, understanding
me.\\
16 - Oh, dear, this is quite a blow.\\
17 - I was counting heavily\\
18 - on the old, conniving you.\\
19 - That's all over, Ethel.\\
20 - Look, what possible harm could there
be in them\\
21 - judging a beauty contest?\\
22 - Are you kidding?\\
23 - Well, they sit out on the beach and
ogle the girls, anyway.\\
24 - This way, I-I-I figure it's
supervised ogling.\\
25 - Well, I don't like it.\\
26 - And anyway, how can they judge\\
27 - a bathing beauty contest?\\
28 - I thought we were going\\
29 - for a boat ride this afternoon.\\
30 - There'll be plenty of time for that.\\
31 - The contest doesn't start until 5:00.\\
32 - Hey, where's Ricky?\\
33 - They want us down at the pool to take
pictures\\
34 - with some of the girls in the
contest.\\
35 - Well, uh, Ricky's in the manager's
office.\\
36 - Okay, I'll Rick pick up in the lobby.\\
37 - I mean, I'll pick Rick up in the
robby.\\
38 - Oh, you know what I mean.\\
39 - Yeah, we know what you mean.\\
40 - What is he...?
Hey, Rick, they want us\\
41 - I'm going to be in a movie that
they're going to make down here.\\
42 - That's great.
Come on, Rick.
The girls are waiting.\\
43 - Yeah.
What kind of a movie?\\
44 - Well, it's a documentary about
Florida.\\
45 - It's the whole history of Florida
from the early days\\
46 - of Ponce de Leon until the present
days.\\
47 - Come on, will you, Rick?\\
48 - Well, honey, how do you fit into
that?\\
49 - Well, I'm gonna be part of the
present days.\\
50 - Me and the band are gonna be\\
51 - playing right here, at the Eden Roc
Hotel.\\
52 - - Come on, will you?
- Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
53 - The bathing beauties are waiting for
us.\\
54 - Will you look at the old goat?\\
55 - He's practically pawing the ground.\\
56 - Oh, never mind, Ethel.\\
57 - I'll be right with you, Fred.
I just want to comb my hair.\\
58 - Hey, Rick, can I borrow some of that
fancy\\
59 - eau de cologne of yours?\\
60 - Sure.\\
61 - Thanks.\\
62 - Eau de cologne, yet!\\
63 - He hasn't used eau de cologne\\
64 - since Lillian Russell came to town.\\
65 - Hello.\\
66 - Yes?\\
67 - We're looking for Mr. Ricky Ricardo.\\
68 - Oh?\\
69 - And Mr. Mertz.\\
70 - Oh?\\
71 - We're supposed to have\\
72 - publicity pictures taken with them.\\
73 - Yes, down by the pool.\\
74 - Are they in?\\
75 - Well, um...\\
76 - No, they're not.\\
77 - Dear! Well, didn't they know about
the pictures?\\
78 - Uh, yes, they knew about them.
But they had to go out.\\
79 - And there's no telling when they'll
be back.\\
80 - Uh, sometimes when they leave like
this, they don't come back\\
81 - for hours, days.\\
82 - Weeks.\\
83 - Months.\\
84 - So if I were you,\\
85 - I-I'd find somebody else to take
pictures with.\\
86 - Oh, welcome home, dear.\\
87 - Huh?\\
88 - Mr. Ricardo?\\
89 - Yes?\\
90 - I'm Joi Lansing.\\
91 - And this is Jill Jarmyn.\\
92 - Oh, well, hello.\\
93 - Glad to know you, girls.\\
94 - How are you?
This is Mr. Mertz.\\
95 - Well, how do you do?\\
96 - Joi!\\
97 - He's a regular little kewpie doll, he
is.\\
98 - We're supposed to have our pictures\\
99 - taken with you down by the pool.\\
100 - In fact, the photographer's waiting
for us right now.\\
101 - Well, we were just on our way
down.\\
102 - I'll just grab some cigarettes, and
we'll go.\\
103 - I was so thrilled when I heard you
were going to be\\
104 - one of the judges, Mr. Ricardo.\\
105 - Oh!
I just adore Cuban music.\\
106 - Thank you. Thank you.\\
107 - Me, too. I must have seen your show\\
108 - in the casino a hundred times.\\
109 - Well, isn't that nice?\\
110 - I get such a boot out of it\\
111 - every time you sing "Babalu."\\
112 - Well, thank you
very much.\\
113 - Shall we go, Fred?\\
114 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go.\\
115 - Bye.\\
116 - Tell me, Mr. Ricardo,\\
117 - is your accent real?\\
118 - Oh, yes, yes.\\
119 - Well, that was a nauseating scene.\\
120 - "Tell me, Mr.
Ricardo,\\
121 - is your accent real?"\\
122 - "Oh, Joi, look.\\
123 - He's a regular little kewpie doll, he
is."\\
124 - "I get such a boot out of it\\
125 - when you sing 'Babalu.'"\\
126 - I'd sure like to give her a boot.\\
127 - And did the boys love it.\\
128 - Did you see Fred's eyes pop out?\\
129 - How about Ricky's eyes?\\
130 - His nose looked like\\
131 - it was balancing two Ping-Pong balls.\\
132 - Hey, what's happened\\
133 - to that understanding attitude?\\
134 - Where is the new you?\\
135 - When I saw those two mincing
mermaids,\\
136 - the old me came right out of
retirement.\\
137 - Oh, boy, it's good to have you back.\\
138 - Now, let me see.\\
139 - How can we keep them\\
140 - from judging that contest?\\
141 - Yeah, what awful thing are we going
to do?\\
142 - I don't know yet, but I got a hunch\\
143 - it's going to be a dilly.\\
144 - Lucy?\\
145 - Yeah.
I got here as fast as I could.\\
146 - Oh, help me, huh?
Okay.\\
147 - Ooh...\\
148 - Now, what's your plan?\\
149 - Well, I told the boatman to only give
us a half a tank of gas.\\
150 - Half a tank?\\
151 - Yeah, so when we get out in the
middle of the ocean,\\
152 - the motor will suddenly go...\\
153 - ...and stop.\\
154 - We'll run out of gas?\\
155 - Yeah. That's my plan\\
156 - for keeping the boys from judging the
contest.\\
157 - Oh, boy, that is a dilly.\\
158 - That's a double dilly.\\
159 - Does your plan also include a way\\
160 - to get back to civilization,\\
161 - or do we just float around\\
162 - in the Atlantic Ocean forever?\\
163 - Ethel, how many times have I ever let
you down?\\
164 - Well, uh...\\
165 - Never mind.\\
166 - Now, when we're sure\\
167 - that they've missed the contest,\\
168 - I suddenly discover this...\\
169 - and pour it in the tank.\\
170 - The boat runs on lemonade?\\
171 - This is filled with gasoline...\\
172 - and this thermos is filled with
lemonade.\\
173 - And this is filled with sawdust.\\
174 - Listen, do you want to keep Fred from\\
175 - judging that contest, or don't you?\\
176 - Oh, yes, I do.
Well, all right!\\
177 - I know he's an old goat,\\
178 - but an old goat's better than no goat
at all.\\
179 - Honey, I want to get some suntan oil
before we go.\\
180 - There's a little shop down there at
the end of the pier.\\
181 - Want to go?
Okay, let's go.\\
182 - Okay.\\
183 - Hey, girls, where are you going?\\
184 - Gonna get some suntan oil!\\
185 - We'll be right back.\\
186 - Well, hurry up!
Yeah.\\
187 - Daddy?
Yeah, son.\\
188 - Is this the boat we're going on?\\
189 - Yeah, that's it.
Isn't she a beauty?\\
190 - Hold him, Uncle Fred.
All right, I'll watch him.\\
191 - Here you go.
There we go.\\
192 - Give me a hand.
Come on, Uncle Fred.\\
193 - All right, thank you.\\
194 - Well, as long as we got a little time\\
195 - I'll 'splain a few more things\\
196 - to you about boats.\\
197 - I'm a landlubber.\\
198 - 'Splain to me, too.\\
199 - All right.\\
200 - Now, over there, see, in the front--\\
201 - that's called the bow.\\
202 - And back here is called the stern.\\
203 - So, that's the bow and the stern.\\
204 - The bow and the stern.\\
205 - That's right. Say!\\
206 - You're a regular skipper already.\\
207 - This cruise-along is a dandy little
boat, Rick.\\
208 - Daddy?
Yeah?\\
209 - I'm thirsty.
You're thirsty?\\
210 - Well, your mommy said she was gonna
bring some lemonade.\\
211 - Is there any lemonade in front there,
Fred?\\
212 - Hey, I found a jug.\\
213 - See if there's any cups in there,
would you?\\
214 - He's thirsty.\\
215 - All right, here we are.\\
216 - Now, Little Ricky,\\
217 - the right side of the boat\\
218 - is called the starboard side.\\
219 - Remember that now.\\
220 - The right side...
Hey, hey.\\
221 - This smells like gasoline.\\
222 - It does?\\
223 - It's supposed to be lemonade.\\
224 - Well, if it's lemonade,\\
225 - it's made from high-octane lemons.\\
226 - Hey, you're right.\\
227 - Yeah.\\
228 - Is there another thermos up front
there?\\
229 - Well, I'll look again.\\
230 - Yeah, here's another.\\
231 - Well, that must be the lemonade.\\
232 - Why do you suppose they put gasoline
in a thermos jug?\\
233 - Well, I don't know, but it's a very
dangerous place\\
234 - to keep gasoline.
Well, that's just...\\
235 - You should only carry gasoline\\
236 - in a safety can.
Yeah.\\
237 - I'll take it out of here\\
238 - and leave it on the pier someplace.\\
239 - Here you are, Little Rick.\\
240 - You try that.\\
241 - There. That all right?\\
242 - Yeah, Uncle Fred.\\
243 - Well, I wonder what's keeping the
girls.\\
244 - Come on...
Oh, here they come.\\
245 - Come on, girls!
Come on!\\
246 - Here we are.\\
247 - - All right.
- Hi.\\
248 - Hi, hi, hi.\\
249 - Oh, boy isn't this gonna be great?\\
250 - Having much fun today, sweetheart?\\
251 - Hi, lovey!\\
252 - Sitting on a nice boat,\\
253 - going out in the ocean, huh?\\
254 - And a nice day for it, too.
Beautiful day, isn't it?\\
255 - Here. Watch this rope, huh?\\
256 - Here, I'll take it, honey.
Over back there.\\
257 - Watch it.
Okay.\\
258 - All right.
Ooh, it's wet.\\
259 - There we go.\\
260 - Now, look at this.\\
261 - Here we go!\\
262 - Having a good time, honey?\\
263 - Oh, just wonderful.\\
264 - We love it.\\
265 - How about you, honeybunch?\\
266 - Oh, Fred, this is marvelous.\\
267 - He's been looking at his watch all
afternoon.\\
268 - Fred, will you forget about that
beauty contest?\\
269 - Huh? That's the farthest thing from
my mind.\\
270 - Say, maybe it is time for us to be
heading home.\\
271 - What time is it, Fred?\\
272 - It's, uh, half past bathing beauty...\\
273 - Uh... I mean, half past 3:00.\\
274 - Uh-oh.\\
275 - What's the matter, Rick?
What's the matter?\\
276 - I don't know.
The motor just stopped.\\
277 - Well, do something, will you?\\
278 - We haven't got much time.\\
279 - Oh, what an awful thing to have
happen.\\
280 - What are we gonna do now, dear?\\
281 - We'll have to take a look at the
engine.\\
282 - I can't understand it.\\
283 - I checked every part of that motor,\\
284 - and I can't find a darn thing wrong
with it.\\
285 - Well, you got to find something
wrong, Rick.\\
286 - We only got about five minutes.\\
287 - Oh, forget it.
We couldn't make it now, anyway.\\
288 - Besides, we got a bigger problem.\\
289 - If we don't get\\
290 - this thing started,\\
291 - we'll just keep drifting\\
292 - further and further out to sea.\\
293 - Oh, are you sure you're too late for
the contest, dear?\\
294 - I'm positive.\\
295 - We can't make it by now.\\
296 - Oh, what a shame.\\
297 - Yeah.\\
298 - Look, honey, I-I don't know anything
about motors,\\
299 - but, uh, maybe we're out of gas.\\
300 - Out of gas?!\\
301 - Don't be ridiculous.\\
302 - Well, now, Rick, it wouldn't hurt\\
303 - just to look and see, would it?\\
304 - All right, if it'll make you happy,
I'll look and see.\\
305 - I've been on boats all my life.\\
306 - Since I was younger than Little
Ricky, I been on boats.\\
307 - I know that these boats don't run out
of gas\\
308 - in an hour and 15 minutes.\\
309 - Let me see...\\
310 - You're right.\\
311 - We're out of gas.\\
312 - Oh, no! Now what are we supposed to
do?\\
313 - Thumb a ride on a passing halibut?\\
314 - Well, now, let's not lose our heads.\\
315 - I seem to remember hearing somewhere\\
316 - that they always keep extra gasoline
on these boats,\\
317 - you know, just for emergencies like
this.\\
318 - Here, let me...
help me down, honey, and I'll...\\
319 - I'll just take a look around, yeah.
Take a look around, honey.\\
320 - See if you can find anything like
that, huh?
Yeah.\\
321 - Yeah, I-I read it someplace...\\
322 - My!
I know I have.\\
323 - Oh, well, now!\\
324 - Look what I found.\\
325 - That's lemonade.\\
326 - Ooh, I must have the wrong one.\\
327 - Where's that thermos of gasoline?\\
328 - Ricky left it on the dock.\\
329 - Left it on the dock?
Yes!\\
330 - Oh, for heaven's sake, Why would you
do a...?\\
331 - How did you know\\
332 - that the gasoline was in the thermos?\\
333 - Uh, uh, well, uh...\\
334 - I'm waiting.
Tell me the story.\\
335 - Yeah, Mommy.
Tell us a story.\\
336 - A story?\\
337 - Well, all right, dear.
Once upon a time\\
338 - there were these three bears--\\
339 - the mama bear, papa bear...\\
340 - Lucy!
Lucy bear...!\\
341 - Lucy!\\
342 - Well, now, we only did it\\
343 - because we love you and Fred so much.\\
344 - Didn't we, Ethel?\\
345 - Uh... Y-Yes.
That's why we did it.\\
346 - That's why.
Did-did what?\\
347 - Yeah. Did what?\\
348 - Well, uh... uh... uh...\\
349 - Told the man that I only needed a
half a tank of gas\\
350 - and then brought the extra gasoline
along in a thermos\\
351 - so that when we were sure that it was\\
352 - too late for you to go to the
contest...\\
353 - and I think I'll try swimming ashore.\\
354 - Of all the miserable things to do.\\
355 - If I were the captain of this tub,
I'd make her walk the plank.\\
356 - Mommy, what's that?\\
357 - What's what?\\
358 - Over there.\\
359 - Look! It's an island!\\
360 - Yeah.\\
361 - Maybe we can drift close enough so we
can wade ashore.\\
362 - Yeah. We can wade ashore.\\
363 - Oh, what good would that do?\\
364 - We'd still be out in the middle of
the Atlantic Ocean.\\
365 - Well, it's better than being adrift.\\
366 - Yeah, it's better than being adrift.\\
367 - Maybe someone would come by
eventually and rescue us.\\
368 - Somebody'd come by and rescue us...
eventually.\\
369 - You see, gang, everything's turning
out all right.\\
370 - Isn't it, Ricky?\\
371 - Isn't it, Fred?\\
372 - Ethel?\\
373 - Little Ricky?\\
374 - I think I'll go below and put myself
in irons.\\
375 - Whoo!\\
376 - Oh, boy.\\
377 - Whoo!\\
378 - Hey, I wonder if anybody lives on
this island.\\
379 - I doubt it.\\
380 - Well, let's find out.
Call out, Ricky.\\
381 - Hello there!\\
382 - Try it in Spanish.\\
383 - Huh?\\
384 - This might be part of Cuba.\\
385 - Oh!\\
386 - Hey, they got some cacanuts
here.\\
387 - Cacanuts?\\
388 - Oh, yeah.\\
389 - There are a lot of cacanuts.\\
390 - Well, it looks like\\
391 - we got the whole island to ourselves.\\
392 - How do you like that?
Marooned on a desert island\\
393 - and it's got to be with, uh...\\
394 - Fred,\\
395 - you'd better be nice to me.\\
396 - We may be here so long that I'll
start looking good to you.\\
397 - Hey!\\
398 - Look at this.\\
399 - What?\\
400 - Huge footprints in the sand.\\
401 - So?\\
402 - So this island might be inhabited.\\
403 - Inhabited by whom?\\
404 - Well, from the looks of these
footprints,\\
405 - giant natives.\\
406 - Giant natives.\\
407 - No kidding. Look at these.\\
408 - Oh, boy. He must be a big one.\\
409 - Now, if I follow them,\\
410 - maybe I'll be able to track him down\\
411 - and find out...\\
412 - Well, it could have been a giant
native.\\
413 - Hey! That's a speedboat!\\
414 - Oh... hey, Mister!\\
415 - Hey!\\
416 - Hey! Mister, we're over here!\\
417 - Hey!
This way! Hey!\\
418 - - Hey, fellas!
- Hey!\\
419 - Come back!\\
420 - How do you like that?\\
421 - All he did was wave back.\\
422 - Yeah.\\
423 - Well, at least he was friendly.\\
424 - Listen, Fred,\\
425 - maybe you and I should go out\\
426 - and see what's on the other side of
this island.\\
427 - All right.
Want to go out with us, Ricky?\\
428 - Sure.
Come on, let's go explore.\\
429 - You stay here and see.
Maybe some boats go by,\\
430 - and maybe you can get their
attention.\\
431 - All right.\\
432 - Oh, boy, this heat is killing me.\\
433 - You're either hot or you're hungry.\\
434 - You're always complaining about
something.\\
435 - Well, that's because when I'm around
you,\\
436 - I always have something to complain
about.\\
437 - Well!\\
438 - How do you like this?\\
439 - Stranded on a desert island.\\
440 - You know, sometimes Lucy goes too
far.\\
441 - Well, there's one good thing about
her.\\
442 - What's that?\\
443 - She makes me glad I'm married to
Ethel.\\
444 - It don't do me any good.\\
445 - See if I can find anything around
here.\\
446 - It's the ocean on the other side.\\
447 - Hey!\\
448 - What's the matter?\\
449 - There's someone in there.\\
450 - Who is it?\\
451 - It looks like a giant native.\\
452 - Boy, you've been married to Lucy too
long.\\
453 - You come and look.\\
454 - You stay here, Little Ricky.\\
455 - Good night, nurse!
You hold them off, Rick.\\
456 - I'll take Little Ricky and make a run
for it.\\
457 - Now, wait a minute, Fred.\\
458 - "Wait" nothing. It's uncles and
little children first.\\
459 - Now, there's got to be an
explanation.\\
460 - There's no natives on these islands.\\
461 - Well, you tell him that while he's
shrinking your head.\\
462 - Now, Fred, I went to high school
here...\\
463 - He's right back of you now.\\
464 - Hello.\\
465 - Good-bye.\\
466 - Hey, what's the matter with you guys?\\
467 - Huh?\\
468 - Aren't you Ricky Ricardo?\\
469 - Yeah.\\
470 - Well, I guess you don't recognize me\\
471 - under all the makeup.\\
472 - I'm Claude Akins.\\
473 - Claude Akins?
Yeah.
The actor?\\
474 - Yeah.\\
475 - Well, goodness sakes.
How are you, Claude?\\
476 - Good to see you.
How are you?\\
477 - Oh, this is Fred Mertz.
Hi, Claude.\\
478 - Hi. How are you?
Nice to see you.
Glad to see you.\\
479 - This is my son.
This is Little Ricky.\\
480 - Well, hi, Rick.\\
481 - You know, I made a picture with
Claude out in Hollywood.\\
482 - Yeah.\\
483 - What are you doing in Miami?\\
484 - Well, I'm playing a native\\
485 - in a picture called The Florida
Story.\\
486 - We're shooting the scene where Ponce
de Leon landed in Florida.\\
487 - I'm in the same picture.\\
488 - Really?
Yeah, in the present day.\\
489 - You mean, there's a whole movie
company here?\\
490 - Sure, right over there.\\
491 - Oh, for goodness sakes.\\
492 - You're here making the picture, too,
huh?\\
493 - No, no. I-I...
We ran out of gas.\\
494 - We were taking a boat ride, and we
run out of gas.\\
495 - Oh.\\
496 - You think we could borrow some gas
from those fellows?\\
497 - Oh, I'm sure you can get some\\
498 - from one of the skippers who brought
us out.\\
499 - Boy, are we lucky we run into him,
huh?\\
500 - You had us plenty scared a minute
ago.\\
501 - Yeah.
We thought you were the giant native\\
502 - Mommy was talking about.
Oh.\\
503 - We thought you were a giant native.\\
504 - Yeah.\\
505 - Hey.\\
506 - I've got an idea.\\
507 - You got a little time on your hands?\\
508 - Sure. Why?\\
509 - Well, our wives are on the other side
of the island, see?\\
510 - And we got a little score to settle
with them.\\
511 - So if you could do us the favor of\\
512 - coming over there...\\
513 - Gee, I wonder what's keeping the
boys.\\
514 - I don't know, but after what you did
to them,\\
515 - I wouldn't blame them if they never
came back.\\
516 - Well, at least we accomplished our
purpose--\\
517 - we kept them from the contest.\\
518 - You got to give me credit for that.\\
519 - Listen, one credit hardly balances 15
years of debits.\\
520 - Sheesh! There's just no talking to
you today.\\
521 - Oh, I must look a mess by now.\\
522 - Ethel...\\
523 - Ethel, your nose is shiny.\\
524 - Why don't you look in the mirror?\\
525 - "Ethel, your nose is shiny."\\
526 - "Ethel, you got big feet."\\
527 - "Ethel, you're always hungry."\\
528 - What is this, "Pick On Ethel Mertz
Week"?\\
529 - Ethel, please powder your nose.\\
530 - Oh, powder your own nose.\\
531 - Ethel, I don't blame you for being
mad,\\
532 - but there's a huge, ferocious-looking
native\\
533 - standing right behind us.\\
534 - You never give up, do you?\\
535 - Ethel, please, look behind you\\
536 - and see if you see what I see.\\
537 - Please?\\
538 - Ho tasho! Ho tasho!\\
539 - He's trying to tell us something.\\
540 - Maybe I'd better talk to him.\\
541 - Well... uh...
d-d-do you think\\
542 - you can understand his language?\\
543 - If I can understand Ricky, I can
understand anybody.\\
544 - Uh...\\
545 - uh...\\
546 - hello...\\
547 - uh, us friends.\\
548 - What you want?\\
549 - Oo-ta-goo-gah.\\
550 - Oo-ta-goo-gah.\\
551 - You go village.\\
552 - Oh, thank you very much,\\
553 - but we don't want to go village.\\
554 - You go village.\\
555 - Big chief have dinner.\\
556 - Hey, Lucy, he's friendly.\\
557 - He wants us to have dinner.\\
558 - Have dinner?\\
559 - He wants us to be dinner.\\
560 - Oh!\\
561 - You!\\
562 - Lucy! Lucy!\\
563 - Oh! Me go village.\\
564 - You get help.\\
565 - Fred! Ricky! Hurry up!
Oh, Rick!\\
566 - What's the matter?
What's the matter?\\
567 - Oh, Rick, look at that savage.
He's going to carry Lucy away.\\
568 - Ricky! Ricky, save me!\\
569 - Well, what are you waiting for?
Aren't you gonna save me?\\
570 - I'm trying to decide.\\
571 - Ricky!\\
572 - Hey, you, stop!\\
573 - Attaboy, Fred!\\
574 - You forgot one.\\
575 - What's so funny?\\
576 - What are you laughing at?\\
577 - What's going on?\\
578 - It's a joke, Mommy.
It's a joke.\\
579 - A joke?\\
580 - Well, some joke.\\
581 - This is Claude Akins.
He's an actor.\\
582 - They're making a picture\\
583 - on the other side of the island.\\
584 - I hope I didn't hurt you too much,
Mrs. Ricardo.\\
585 - You didn't hurt me, but you scared
the daylights out of me.\\
586 - Oh, what a dirty trick.\\
587 - What are you talking about?
You started the whole thing.\\
588 - Hey, you better go and borrow that
gas,\\
589 - if we're going to get out of here.\\
590 - Yeah.
Hey, listen.\\
591 - Why don't you all stick around?\\
592 - As soon as we're through shooting,
the whole cast\\
593 - and crew are going to have a beach
party, a kind of a luau.\\
594 - You're all invited.\\
595 - A luau? Well, I'd like that.\\
596 - - Yeah.
- How 'bout it?\\
597 - - That's my favorite food.
- Yeah.\\
598 - Wonderful.\\
599 - You see, honey?
I told you everything\\
600 - was going to turn out all right.\\
601 - Yeah!\\
602 - We've been looking all over for you.\\
603 - The luau's about to start.
Oh!\\
604 - Why, Mr. Ricardo and Mr. Mertz.\\
605 - What are you all doing here?\\
606 - Well, our boat ran out of gas.\\
607 - What are you doing here?\\
608 - Yeah.\\
609 - Yeah. What are you all doing here?\\
610 - Well, they needed some more girls for
the picture,\\
611 - so they brought us all out here.\\
612 - Well, what happened to the contest?\\
613 - Why, that's been postponed till
tomorrow.\\
614 - Come on, everybody.
Let's go to the luau.\\
615 - You want to come with me?\\
616 - Come on, Mr. Mertz.
Here we go.\\
617 - Come on, Ricky.
Yeah!\\
618 - Hey, you were right.\\
619 - Everything worked out real fine.
\subsection {Episode 09: The Ricardos Visit Cuba (1956)}
1 - Oh, Lucy, isn't this exciting?\\
2 - In a little while we'll land in Cuba\\
3 - and you'll meet Ricky's family.\\
4 - Well, to tell you the truth, Ethel,
I'm scared.\\
5 - Scared?\\
6 - Well, weren't you when you met Fred's
family\\
7 - for the first time?\\
8 - After marrying Fred, nothing could
scare me.\\
9 - Oh, I sure hope they like me.\\
10 - Honey, they'll love you.\\
11 - What if they don't?\\
12 - Well, so they don't.\\
13 - What are they going to do\\
14 - start another Spanish-American war?\\
15 - Honey, stop worrying.\\
16 - They'll love you.\\
17 - Oh, just think...\\
18 - you'll be visiting your relatives\\
19 - in a foreign land.\\
20 - Sometimes I wish I'd married a Cuban.\\
21 - That makes two of us.\\
22 - Oh, go back to sleep.\\
23 - Ricky, what are you going to say\\
24 - when you meet your grandmother?\\
25 - Buenos dias, abuela.\\
26 - Very good, very good.\\
27 - What are you going to say, Mommy?\\
28 - What, dear?\\
29 - What are you going to say when you
meet my mother?\\
30 - Oh, um...\\
31 - Bonus dies, madry.\\
32 - Bonus dies, madry?\\
33 - Honey, it's buenos dias, madre.\\
34 - I don't think that's very nice,\\
35 - making fun of my Spanish.\\
36 - Well, you've been making fun of my
English\\
37 - for 15 years.\\
38 - Well, English is a foreign language
to me.\\
39 - Well, the way you speak it\\
40 - it is to me, too.\\
41 - I don't know why you're so worried.\\
42 - After all, Ricky's mother loved you\\
43 - when she visited you in New York.\\
44 - Well, I'm not worried about his
mother.\\
45 - It's all those other relatives--\\
46 - his aunts, his uncles, his nieces,
his cousins,\\
47 - his great uncles, his great aunts.\\
48 - Oh, now, honey, a big family's nice.\\
49 - You don't know how big his family is.\\
50 - Let's see.\\
51 - There's Uncle Pedro, and Aunt Rosa,\\
52 - and Uncle, uh...\\
53 - Rafael.\\
54 - Rafael\\
55 - and Aunt Sylvia and Aunt...\\
56 - Maria Pepa.\\
57 - Maria Pepa.\\
58 - Uncle Jorge.\\
59 - That's Uncle George.\\
60 - Nandine, Manuel, Amberta...\\
61 - Guillermito Menendez.\\
62 - Who?\\
63 - That's another uncle.
Guillermito Menendez.\\
64 - That's another one.\\
65 - Amparo...\\
66 - Amparo.\\
67 - Eduardo.\\
68 - Eduardo.
He's the judge.\\
69 - The twins.\\
70 - The twins.
If you ask me\\
71 - you did not leave the island of Cuba
voluntarily.\\
72 - You were squeezed off.\\
73 - Now look, honey, I told you\\
74 - that the only one that you got to
worry about--\\
75 - and remember,\\
76 - the only one that is really important\\
77 - is Uncle Alberto.\\
78 - Yeah, Uncle Alberto.\\
79 - He's the head of the family.\\
80 - I remember that.\\
81 - That's right.
He practically raised me.\\
82 - You make a good impression on him and
you're in.\\
83 - Well, I shall certainly try, you know
that.\\
84 - Now, I just want to warn you; it's
not going to be easy.\\
85 - Uncle Alberto's the one that wanted
me to marry a Cu...\\
86 - What were you saying, dear?\\
87 - Oh, uh...\\
88 - I-I was saying that Uncle Alberto\\
89 - is the one that wanted me to marry\\
90 - a cute, red-headed American.\\
91 - You were not.\\
92 - You were saying that Uncle Alberto\\
93 - was the one who wanted you to marry a
Cuban girl.\\
94 - I didn't say anything of the kind.\\
95 - But you were going to say it.\\
96 - How do you know?\\
97 - I might not be able to understand\\
98 - what you say when you say it,\\
99 - but before you say it\\
100 - I can understand what you're going to
say perfectly.\\
101 - No wonder Uncle Alberto wanted me to
marry a Cuban girl.\\
102 - So, you admit it.\\
103 - But I didn't marry a Cuban girl.\\
104 - I married you.\\
105 - Daddy, I'm glad you married Mommy.\\
106 - Well, you and me both, partner.\\
107 - And I'll bet that Uncle Alberto\\
108 - will be glad, too, when he meets you.\\
109 - Oh, I hope so, dear.
Sure.\\
110 - Our clipper will be landing in Havana
in 15 minutes.\\
111 - Oh, dear, do we have to?\\
112 - Honey?\\
113 - Yes, dear?\\
114 - Honey, did we have to have this
family reunion\\
115 - our first night in Havana?\\
116 - Couldn't you have made it some other
night?\\
117 - Well, honey, you know that\\
118 - we're only going to be in Havana two
nights.\\
119 - And tomorrow night, they've asked me
to appear\\
120 - at the Casino Parisien here at the
Nationale.\\
121 - So, what other night is there?\\
122 - Well, I was thinking about some night
next year maybe.\\
123 - Now, honey, you'll get along just
fine.\\
124 - Oh, I wish Fred and Ethel were going
to be here.\\
125 - Well, you know, we invited them,\\
126 - but they felt it was a family
reunion;\\
127 - they didn't want to barge in.\\
128 - Well, I feel the same way.\\
129 - I think I'll join Fred and Ethel.\\
130 - Now, Lucy, come back here.\\
131 - Daddy, when is abuela going to get
here?\\
132 - In a few minutes, son.
Who?\\
133 - Abuela.\\
134 - It means grandma.\\
135 - Oh. I'm so nervous I can't remember
my own name.\\
136 - It's Mommy.\\
137 - Thank you very much.\\
138 - Oh, they're not going to understand
me.\\
139 - I'm not going to be able to
understand them.\\
140 - Now look, honey, they speak a few
words of English.\\
141 - You speak a few words of Spanish...\\
142 - Oh, I've forgotten my Spanish.\\
143 - Well, you took it in high school,
didn't you?\\
144 - Don't you remember anything?\\
145 - I remember I flunked.\\
146 - Well, look, all you have to remember
is just a few words.\\
147 - If I help you, maybe it'll all come
back to you.\\
148 - All right.\\
149 - Say hello.
Hello.\\
150 - No, in Spanish.\\
151 - How you gonna greet them when they
get here?\\

boy.\\

250 - I'm sorry, Uncle Alberto.\\

256 - You look well.\\
257 - Tu muy bien tambien.\\
258 - Muy bien. Muy bien.\\
259 - You see, she was nervous.\\
260 - You know, she was nervous meeting
you.\\
261 - Te debias haber casado con una
muchacha Cubana.\\
262 - But I wasn't in love with a Cuban
girl.\\
263 - You'll love Lucy when you get to know
her.\\
264 - You really would.
Dale una oportunidad.\\
265 - I'll give her, I'll give her...
Very well, very well.\\
266 - Honey, come on. Come on.\\
267 - Oh, I'm so sorry.
I was so nervous.\\
268 - I made a terrible impression on your
uncle.\\
269 - Honey, no, no.\\
270 - Why don't you tell him it's an old
American custom.\\
271 - Oh, now-- What?\\
272 - When you like somebody, you break
their hat.\\
273 - Now, honey, I had a talk with him\\
274 - and everything's smoothed out.\\
275 - Now, you just go over and talk with
him.\\
276 - Oh, do I have to?\\
277 - Por favor.
Please.\\
278 - What will I say?\\
279 - Well, let him do the talking.\\
280 - Oh, okay.\\
281 - Uh, Uncle Alberto?\\
282 - ?Si, querida?\\
283 - Would you care for some punch?\\
284 - Si. Macho grasa.\\
285 - What?\\
286 - Macho grasa.\\
287 - ?Que modo de tratar el tio son esas?\\
288 - What did I say?
What'd I say?\\
289 - What? What did you say?\\
290 - He asked me if I wanted some punch.\\
291 - I said, si. Macho grasa.\\
292 - ?Macho grasa?\\
293 - Oh, dear, it's muchas gracias.\\
294 - You just called him a big, fat pig.\\
295 - Oh, no!\\
296 - Say you're sorry.\\
297 - That you didn't know what you were
saying.\\
298 - Uncle Alberto...\\
299 - Oh!\\
300 - Oh, I'm so sorry!\\
301 - I'm so sorry.\\
302 - I'm terribly sorry, Uncle Alberto.\\
303 - It will come right off.\\
304 - It will come right off.\\
305 - Let me get some cold water.\\
306 - It will come right off.\\
307 - Honey, please. Honey...\\
308 - Lucy, sit down, darling.\\
309 - I'll get a towel, dear.\\
310 - My cigars! My cigars!\\
311 - He should have married a Cuban girl.\\
312 - Now, honey, it couldn't have been
that bad.\\
313 - Well, I ruined his straw hat, spilled
punch on his clothes,\\
314 - crushed his cigars,\\
315 - and called him a big, fat pig in
Spanish.\\
316 - Well, that's pretty bad, even for
you.\\
317 - After what I did last night\\
318 - Cuba may cut off America's sugar
supply.\\
319 - Oh, dear.\\
320 - We've got to rehearse.\\
321 - Hey! Hey!\\
322 - Hey, where did you get that drum?\\
323 - Uncle Alberto gave it to me.\\
324 - Yeah. It's the drum I used to have\\
325 - when I was a little boy.\\
326 - Yeah?\\
327 - Say, shall we tell them the big news?\\
328 - Ricky's going to appear with me
tonight.\\
329 - Oh.
No kidding.\\
330 - Will you be there?\\
331 - Will we?!\\
332 - Why, we wouldn't miss that for
anything in the world.\\
333 - My whole family's coming.\\
334 - I got a big table reserved.\\
335 - Yeah, you better reserve one table
for your family\\
336 - and one for me.\\
337 - Oh, now, honey, what are you talking
about?\\
338 - After what happened last night,\\
339 - Uncle Alberto will never want to see
me again,\\
340 - much less sit at the same table with
me.\\
341 - Now, that's not true.\\
342 - Well, if the first time I met you\\
343 - I said awful things, spilled stuff
all over you,\\
344 - and acted like a first-class
nincompoop,\\
345 - what would you have done?\\
346 - Just what I did--\\
347 - wait for my clothes to come back from
the cleaners\\
348 - and then marry you.\\
349 - Boy, he's got a memory like an
elephant.\\
350 - Come on, partner, we got to go to
rehearsal.\\
351 - Listen, after the rehearsal,\\
352 - I'm going to take him over to his
grandma's house\\
353 - and then I'm going to see Uncle
Alberto.\\
354 - So I'll see you later.
Okay.\\
355 - Adios.
Good-bye.\\
356 - Adios.
Bye-bye, dear.\\
357 - Oh, come on now, honey, snap out of
it.\\
358 - Let's all go shopping.\\
359 - Shopping? Again?\\
360 - Yeah, let's go shopping.\\
361 - There's something I want to get.\\
362 - What?\\
363 - A box of cigars for Uncle Alberto.\\
364 - I found out where he has his made.\\
365 - Maybe if I get some more for him\\
366 - I'll get back in his good graces.\\
367 - Oh, sure you will, honey.\\
368 - Come on.
Oh, look at me.\\
369 - Brown purse, blue shoes.\\
370 - Heavens to Betsy.\\
371 - I'll only be a second.\\
372 - I want to get my other purse.\\
373 - I'm going to get my other wallet.\\
374 - I left my money in this one.\\
375 - Yeah, this is the place, all right.\\
376 - Oh, look, they make cigars by hand.\\
377 - Isn't that interesting?\\
378 - Mm-hmm.
Hey, how about that?\\
379 - Honey, while you're buying the cigars\\
380 - I think I'll go buy some more
souvenirs.\\
381 - Ethel, do you think I'm made of
money?\\
382 - Oh, I just want to buy a pair of
those maracas.\\
383 - Swell-- then we can mambo\\
384 - all the way to the poor house.\\
385 - I'll catch up with you later.\\
386 - Buenos dias, senora.\\
387 - Bonus dies.\\
388 - What can I do for you?\\
389 - I'd like a box of Corona Grande,
please.\\
390 - Por favor.\\
391 - Aqui estan sus tobacos.\\
392 - El mejor tobaco en Havana.\\
393 - Ah, macho gra...\\
394 - I mean, muchas gracias.\\
395 - Quince pesos.\\
396 - What's that?\\
397 - 15 Dollars.\\
398 - 15 Dollars?\\
399 - Si, senora.\\
400 - Oh, my gosh!\\
401 - ?Que paso?\\
402 - I forgot to put my money in this
purse.\\
403 - I have some friends right down the
street.\\
404 - I'll go get them\\
405 - and bring the money back to you.\\
406 - No money, no cigars.\\
407 - What are you talking...?\\
408 - Look what you did!\\
409 - What do you mean, "what I did," for
heaven's sake.\\
410 - If you hadn't grabbed ahold my arm,\\
411 - I wouldn't have dropped the box.\\
412 - Si usted hubiera traido dinero\\
413 - no pasa esto.\\
414 - Now, you have to pay for this.\\
415 - Well, how can I pay for them\\
416 - if you won't let me get the money
from my friends?\\
417 - You stay here.\\
418 - Your friends come back for you.\\
419 - But they're not coming back for me.\\
420 - Oh, then I call the police right now.\\
421 - What are you talking about, for
heaven's sakes?\\
422 - Why should you call the police?\\
423 - Me espera ahi un ratito.\\
424 - Ahorita regreso, ?eh?\\
425 - Ah, Senor Don Alberto.\\
426 - ?Como esta usted?\\
427 - Muy bien, senor.\\
428 - What can I do for you?\\

433 - que ha comprado usted una casa\\
434 - en Santiago.\\
435 - Bueno, una casa asi no mas.\\
436 - No vaya creer que es una cosa del
otro mundo.\\
437 - Este es un tobaco
excelente.\\
438 - Tambien aqui esta...\\
439 - Mire usted, esto lo
hemos hecho\\
440 - de un tobaco selecto\\
441 - para gustos delicados de la
aristocracia.\\
442 - ?Que le parece?\\
443 - Ah, que bien.\\
444 - Este es una cosa
excelente.\\
445 - Hey ?Donde esta?\\
446 - La Americana loca que ha venido aqui.\\
447 - La turista.\\
448 - I didn't see no one.\\
449 - Dice usted que ha
venido.\\
450 - Me ha comprado cigarros.\\
451 - Se ha ido sin pagarme.\\
452 - Y ademas de eso los ha roto y los ha
pisado.\\
453 - No hay derecho, pero...
Angelo,\\
454 - ?has visto a alguien salir por aqui?\\
455 - Maybe she went out this door.\\
456 - No puede ser.\\
457 - Senor Don Alberto, I'm sorry for this
delay.\\
458 - Don't worry.\\
459 - I am waiting for my nephew right
here.\\
460 - Which one?\\
461 - Ricky, the one that married the
Americana.\\
462 - Oh, el maestro que tiene
una orquestra famosa.\\
463 - Tendre mucho gusto en verlo.\\
464 - If you think that Americana turista
is bad\\
465 - you should meet my nephew's wife.\\
466 - No!\\
467 - Alberto.\\
468 - ?Como estas?\\
469 - Mi sobrino, Ricky Ricardo.\\
470 - Mucho gusto.\\
471 - An American ruined a whole box of his
best cigars.\\
472 - Si, senor. Si, senor.\\
473 - Americano?\\
474 - Si, una loca turista Americana.\\
475 - Si, imaginese que ha venido los roto\\
476 - se ha querido ir sin pagar.\\
477 - Sin pagar, senor!\\
478 - Disappeared right before his
eyes.\\
479 - ?Una loca turista Americana?\\
480 - Loquisima!
Loquisima!\\
481 - No sabe donde...\\
482 - Alberto, I just remembered\\
483 - I got to be someplace in ten minutes.\\
484 - Look at that big cigar they're
making.\\
485 - They don't make them like they used
to anymore do they?\\
486 - Aha!\\
487 - That's the woman!\\
488 - No, senor...\\
489 - Ladies and gentlemen, this evening,
the casino\\
490 - takes great pleasure and pride\\
491 - in presenting a very special
attraction.\\
492 - Some years ago,\\
493 - a young boy left Cuba to go to
America.\\
494 - The only thing that he took with him\\
495 - was a drum full of rhythm\\
496 - and a heart full of hope.\\
497 - He's back home tonight.\\
498 - Let's give him a real great welcome.\\
499 - Ricky Ricardo!\\
500 - Pablo!\\
501 - You see un hombre afortunado\\
502 - Which means you're looking at a lucky
guy\\
503 - In Cuba, I'm a Cuban\\
504 - In the U.S.A., I'm a yank\\
505 - Wherever I am, I'm home, and I got
you to thank\\
506 - You never see me homesick\\

510 - I've got two places to hang my hat\\
511 - Two verandas if we choose to\\
512 - And in two languages, a welcome mat\\
513 - To say "hello" to my shoes\\
514 - In New York or Havana, people make me
feel I belong\\
515 - Wherever I am, I'm home\\
516 - I can go, but I can't go wrong\\
517 - Just name me one other chap\\
518 - With a girl like Lucy on his lap\\
519 - And a diet of hot tamales and apple
pie\\
520 - You see un hombre afortunado\\
521 - Which means you're looking at a lucky
guy\\
522 - I'm a lucky guy\\
523 - What a lucky guy\\
524 - Yes, sir, you're looking at a lucky
guy.\\
525 - Here's your hat, Uncle Alberto.\\
526 - Thank you.\\
527 - Thank you very, very much, ladies and
gentlemen.\\
528 - You don't know how wonderful it is to
be back in Cuba.\\
529 - You know, I...
I left here alone,\\
530 - but I didn't come back alone.\\
531 - I'd like you to meet my wife, a
wonderful girl.\\
532 - Lucy.\\
533 - And I'd like to ask another member of
the family\\
534 - to join me in the next number.\\
535 - I'd like you to meet my son, Ricky,
Jr.\\
536 - Say, "gracias."\\
537 - Gracias.\\
538 - Now, uh, even though Little Ricky was
born in America,\\
539 - I want to prove to you\\
540 - that there's a lot of Cuba in his
heart.\\
541 - Hey!\\
542 - Babalu\\

\subsection {Episode 10: Little Ricky's School Pageant (1956)}
1 - Hello.\\
2 - Oh, hi, Caroline.\\
3 - Yeah, we got back Friday.\\
4 - Oh, I just loved it.\\
5 - Florida was marvelous.\\
6 - Cuba?\\
7 - Well, just bueno, bueno, that's all.\\
8 - I met all of Ricky's family,\\
9 - and guess what, Caroline.\\
10 - I learned how to do the cha-cha-cha.\\
11 - Took lessons at the hotel.\\
12 - No, it wasn't too expensive.\\
13 - It came to about ten dollars a cha.\\
14 - Well, it's, uh...\\
15 - it's sort of like the rumba, only
you, uh...\\
16 - you do a lot more, uh...\\
17 - And then there's two or three times
that you, that you...\\
18 - Oh.\\
19 - Hi, Mommy. What are you doing?\\
20 - Yeah, well, just a minute.\\
21 - Caroline, I got to run now.\\
22 - I'll call you back later.\\
23 - Okay, dear. Bye.\\
24 - Oh, I-I'm just dancing, honey.\\
25 - Hi, sweetheart.\\
26 - Well, now, were you a good boy this
afternoon?\\
27 - Oh, he was just a doll.\\
28 - He and Uncle Fred have been playing
cowboys and Indians.\\
29 - Lucy, if you've got this thing
unpacked,\\
30 - I'll put it down in the basement.\\
31 - Oh, Fred.\\
32 - Oh, what's so funny?\\
33 - Isn't he cute?\\
34 - That's the way he used to look when
he had hair.\\
35 - Here, cowboy.\\
36 - You'd better put that back in the
wigwam.\\
37 - Go on, honey. You can take that
anytime, Fred.\\
38 - What's the matter?\\
39 - Can't you handle it by yourself?\\
40 - No, I can't handle it by
myself.\\
41 - Why not?\\
42 - Because when I lost my hair, I lost
my strength.\\
43 - Well, if you expect me to help you,\\
44 - you just lost your mind.\\
45 - Hi. Hiya, Fred.\\
46 - Oh, hi, Rick.\\
47 - Hi, honey.\\
48 - Hey, Rick, will you help me\\
49 - put this thing down in the basement?\\
50 - Why, sure, Fred.\\
51 - Come on, grab ahold.\\
52 - Where's Little Ricky?\\
53 - Oh, he'll be out in a minute.\\
54 - Honey, here's Daddy.
Hi, partner!\\
55 - Hi, Daddy.
Hi.\\
56 - Hey, honey, hurry back, will you?\\
57 - Because I want to tell you all about
the PTA meeting.\\
58 - We made some wonderful plans.\\
59 - No, absolutely not.\\
60 - "No, absolutely not" what?\\
61 - I am not going to cook Spanish food
for 800 people\\
62 - at another school bazaar again.\\
63 - Well, it's not a bazaar.\\
64 - It's a pageant, and it's called The
Enchanted Forest.\\
65 - Oh. Oh.\\
66 - Little Ricky's gonna be in it.\\
67 - Oh, is he?
Yeah.\\
68 - What's he gonna do?\\
69 - I don't know. They haven't assigned
the parts yet.\\
70 - Well, if, uh...\\
71 - they haven't assigned the parts,\\
72 - how do you know that he's gonna be in
it?\\
73 - Well, it's being presented by the
kindergarten\\
74 - and the first and second grades.\\
75 - He's bound to be in it.\\
76 - Oh, I see.\\
77 - In fact, I assume Little Ricky will
have the star part.\\
78 - And why do you assume that he's gonna
have the star part?\\
79 - Well, my goodness, it's perfectly
obvious to me\\
80 - that Little Ricky has much more
talent\\
81 - than any other child in the school.\\
82 - It should also be obvious to you\\
83 - that there are a lot\\
84 - of other talented children in school,\\
85 - and that their families\\
86 - probably feel exactly the same way.\\
87 - Well, honey, it's only right that the
most talented child\\
88 - get the biggest role.\\
89 - Now, it isn't fair to our son\\
90 - to give him a stale, unimportant
little part.\\
91 - Now, Lucy, listen to me.\\
92 - Hey, Ricky,\\
93 - wouldn't you like to go into your
room\\
94 - and play with your trains?\\
95 - No, Daddy.
I'd like to stay here.\\
96 - Oh. Well...\\
97 - will you do it as a favor to Daddy?\\
98 - Okay.\\
99 - Thank you, partner.\\
100 - Thank you, sweetheart.\\
101 - See you in a minute.\\
102 - Lucy, we know that the child is
talented,\\
103 - but that is not the point.\\
104 - It is much more important\\
105 - that he learns how to cooperate\\
106 - and to become a part of a group\\
107 - than it is for him to be the center
of attention.\\
108 - Well...\\
109 - No, really. We don't want him to
think\\
110 - that... that the world revolves
around him.\\
111 - We want him to learn that there are
other people\\
112 - that count, too.\\
113 - You know something, honey?\\
114 - You're absolutely right.\\
115 - You know, you're a regular Cuban Dr.
Spock.\\
116 - Well, thank you.\\
117 - Then it's all settled, huh?\\
118 - Yeah, it's all settled, baby.\\
119 - Okay. Come on, Fred, let's get this
thing downstairs.\\
120 - What? Already?\\
121 - Yeah, children sure love to have a
snack\\
122 - when they come home from school in
the afternoon.\\
123 - Kids never seem to get full.\\
124 - No.\\
125 - I guess they burn up a lot of energy
playing.\\
126 - Yeah.\\
127 - Well, I burn up a lot of energy
eating.\\
128 - Yeah.\\
129 - Hi, Mommy. Hi, Ethel.\\
130 - Well, hi, there.\\
131 - Hi, sweetheart.\\
132 - Look at those rosy cheeks.\\
133 - I bet it was cold outside today.\\
134 - My sandwich!\\
135 - Where's my sandwich?!\\
136 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
137 - Oh, sweetheart, I'm so sorry.\\
138 - There we are.\\
139 - Honey, did you have a good time in
school today?\\
140 - No.\\
141 - No?!\\
142 - No!\\
143 - Gee, it reminds me of my schooldays.\\
144 - Well, honey, what happened?\\
145 - It's the old pageant.\\
146 - What about the pageant?\\
147 - Didn't the teacher give you a part?\\
148 - Yes.\\
149 - Well, then why the long face?\\
150 - She just wanted to give me a little
part.\\
151 - Well, now, I think that's fine.\\
152 - I don't.\\
153 - Why not?\\
154 - I don't want a stale little part.\\
155 - Oh, dear. You don't?\\
156 - I should get a big part.\\
157 - I've got talent.\\
158 - Well, now, whoever told you that?\\
159 - You did.\\
160 - Where are you going?\\
161 - I think I hear my mother calling me.\\
162 - Little Ricky, darling,\\
163 - I want to have a talk with you.\\
164 - Now, listen, honey.\\
165 - Even though\\
166 - you might want to have a big part in
the pageant,\\
167 - you must realize that the other
little boys and girls\\
168 - in the school want to have a big
part, too.\\
169 - Now, the main thing\\
170 - is to make the pageant a success,
isn't it?\\
171 - So, honey, it's much more important\\
172 - for you to cooperate, and be a member
of the group,\\
173 - than it is to be the center of
attention.\\
174 - Do you understand what I'm trying to
say?\\
175 - Yes, Mommy.\\
176 - Good.\\
177 - Now, tomorrow, when you go to school,\\
178 - I want you to tell your teacher\\
179 - that you'll be very happy to accept
that stale...\\
180 - that nice little part in the pageant.
Okay?\\
181 - Okay, Mommy.\\
182 - All right, sweetheart.\\
183 - Hi, Lucy.\\
184 - Hi.\\
185 - Say, how about playing\\
186 - some bridge tonight?\\
187 - Oh, sorry, honey.\\
188 - Ricky has to go\\
189 - to a fathers' meeting at school.\\
190 - And, say, the last time we played
bridge,\\
191 - you said you'd never want to play
with me again.\\
192 - What happened?\\
193 - Our television set's broken.\\
194 - Stranded, eh?\\
195 - Hi, Ethel.
Hi.\\
196 - Honey, I'll be back about 8:30 or
9:00.
Okay.\\
197 - What's the meeting for, Rick?\\
198 - Well, it's a school pageant, you
know.\\
199 - Yeah, well, the parents are going to
take part in it, too,\\
200 - and the fathers are getting their
assignments tonight.\\
201 - Yeah, they'll probably want me\\
202 - to produce and direct the whole
thing.\\
203 - Gee, it sounds like a big job.\\
204 - Yes, I guess it'll be, but, you know,\\
205 - it's one of those things that they
ask you to do\\
206 - that you have to do, you know.\\
207 - Well, I'm very proud of you, dear.\\
208 - You're such a good father.\\
209 - It's nothing, honey.\\
210 - It's a community project,\\
211 - and everyone should be proud and glad
to do their part.\\
212 - That's right, dear.\\
213 - I'll see you later.\\
214 - Bye-bye, sweetheart.\\
215 - Oh, boy, you're married to a
wonderful guy.\\
216 - Yeah.\\
217 - Hey, how about playing some
three-handed bridge?\\
218 - Okay. I'll go get the dummy.\\
219 - That meeting's taking longer than
Ricky figured.\\
220 - Well, you know Ricky.\\
221 - When he's in charge of something,\\
222 - time means nothing.\\
223 - Huh! Mira!\\
224 - Que quieren la cosa la gente.
Huh!\\
225 - Se puede ofrecerle uno que voy
hacerlo.\\
226 - Y quieren que haga alli\\
227 - Y no me lo dan a mi nada!\\
228 - Honey! Honey!
What's wrong?\\
229 - I'll tell you what's wrong.
What?\\
230 - You know who they picked\\
231 - to produce and direct the pageant?\\
232 - Who?\\
233 - Clifford Terry.\\
234 - Clifford Terry?!\\
235 - Yeah. He's not even in show business.\\
236 - He runs an orange juice stand.\\
237 - Why did they ever pick him?\\
238 - Because, during intermission,\\
239 - he's gonna give them free orange
juice.\\
240 - That's why they ever picked him.\\
241 - What are you gonna be?
His assistant?\\
242 - No.\\
243 - His assistant's assistant?
No.\\
244 - Know what they want me to do?
What?\\
245 - They want me to be an actor\\
246 - with all the little kids in The
Enchanted Forest.\\
247 - Well, honey, that doesn't sound so
bad.\\
248 - It's probably a big role.\\
249 - What part are you gonna play?\\
250 - A hollow tree.\\
251 - A hollow tree?\\
252 - A hollow tree.\\
253 - Eso es lo que quieren que yo haga.\\
254 - Un actor como mi pasando un hollow
tree.\\
255 - Eso es lo que quieren que haga yo
alla.\\
256 - The only father in the whole school\\
257 - that is in show business,\\
258 - and they want me to play a hollow
tree.\\
259 - Mira que tienen cosa.\\
260 - I've got a good mind to tell them
that\\
261 - I don't want anything to do\\
262 - with the whole school pageant.\\
263 - Daddy, you woke me up.\\
264 - Oh. I'm sorry, son.\\
265 - I'm... I'm sorry I shouted so loud.\\
266 - Daddy?\\
267 - What?\\
268 - Why don't you want to be a tree?\\
269 - Oh. Well, I'm a performer.\\
270 - I've been in show business since I
was a...\\
271 - I think you should be a tree.\\
272 - You do?\\
273 - Uh-huh. It's more fun to cooperate\\
274 - than to be the center of attention.\\
275 - You're right, son.\\
276 - You're absolutely right.\\
277 - I'll be a tree.\\
278 - Oh, boy! Daddy's gonna be a tree!\\
279 - Daddy's gonna be a tree!\\
280 - Well, I guess he taught you a lesson.\\
281 - Just because you couldn't be the big
cheese,\\
282 - you didn't want to play.\\
283 - Don't you talk too much.\\
284 - Wait till you find out what they want
you to do.\\
285 - What?\\
286 - You are going to be the old witch.\\
287 - Ew!\\
288 - Oh, a hollow tree and an old witch.\\
289 - Funny, huh?\\
290 - And don't you two laugh either.\\
291 - What do you mean?\\
292 - Well, all the parents are busy\\
293 - in the production and direction end\\
294 - of this extravaganza,\\
295 - so I told them that you two\\
296 - would be very happy to take a part.\\
297 - Oh.\\
298 - Oh, no. What did they pick out for
me?\\
299 - Oh, they got a dilly for you.\\
300 - You're gonna be a frog.\\
301 - Freddy the Frog.\\
302 - Oh, that's really funny.\\
303 - And you, Ethel, are gonna be\\
304 - - the Fairy Princess.
- Oh!\\
305 - Well, if there's anything funnier
than me being a frog,\\
306 - it's you being a fairy princess.\\
307 - Hey, how come she's a fairy princess\\
308 - and I'm a witch?\\
309 - Now, look, dear, remember,\\
310 - you have to cooperate with the group.\\
311 - I don't mind cooperating,\\
312 - but this casting is ridiculous.\\
313 - Just what do you mean by that?\\
314 - Oh, nothing personal, Ethel,\\
315 - but anyone can see you look more like
a witch than I do.\\
316 - Well, I'm glad you didn't get
personal.\\
317 - Look, it's really purely a matter of
economics.\\
318 - What do you mean?\\
319 - Well, they want to use the costume\\
320 - that they used last year for the
Fairy Princess,\\
321 - and Ethel happens to fit it perfect.\\
322 - Oh, yeah, last year.
I remember.\\
323 - Jimmy Wilson's mother was the Fairy
Princess\\
324 - and, oh, she's a...\\
325 - Oh, you'll fit it perfectly.\\
326 - Hi, Mommy.
Hi, Daddy.\\
327 - Hi, partner.\\
328 - Oh, hi, sweetheart.\\
329 - Say, that bus got you home kind of
early today, didn't it?\\
330 - Say, what's this?\\
331 - Oh, what have you been doing?\\
332 - A note from the teacher.\\
333 - "Dear Mrs. Ricardo,\\
334 - "The child who was to have played the
lead in the pageant\\
335 - "can't do it because his parents feel
the part is too big,\\
336 - "and he can't memorize all the lines.\\
337 - "If you think your son can handle it,\\
338 - we'd like him to play the lead."\\
339 - Isn't that wonderful?\\
340 - Wait a minute, honey.
Who are you calling?\\
341 - I'm going to call his teacher\\
342 - and tell her we'd be delighted to
have Ricky play the lead.\\
343 - Now, wait a minute, honey.\\
344 - I don't know whether he can handle a
lead.\\
345 - He's just a little boy.\\
346 - Honey, he's got show business in his
blood.\\
347 - You can handle\\
348 - the lead, can't you, honey?\\
349 - Sure, Mommy.\\
350 - Sure.\\
351 - Hello? Hello, Miss Pringle.\\
352 - This is Mrs. Ricardo.\\
353 - Yes. We just read your note,\\
354 - and we'd like to tell you that we'd
be delighted\\
355 - to have Ricky play the lead.\\
356 - Yes. Well, thank you very much. Bye.\\
357 - Mommy.
What, sweetheart?\\
358 - What's a lead?\\
359 - Oh, dear.\\
360 - "What's a lead?"\\
361 - Come on, partner.
Time to go to bed.\\
362 - Oh, not yet, dear.
I want him\\
363 - to rehearse his lines just once more.\\
364 - Oh. How's he doing?\\
365 - Fine. By tomorrow night,\\
366 - he's gonna be perfect.\\
367 - Now, honey, let's show Daddy.\\
368 - Little Suzy says, "Sometime, wouldn't
you like to visit\\
369 - the Enchanted Forest, Billy?"\\
370 - Come on, now.
You remember, honey.\\
371 - All you do is nod.\\
372 - That's right.\\
373 - Lucy, I don't know, dear.\\
374 - This is an awfully big part for a
little fellow.\\
375 - I don't think we can expect him\\
376 - to memorize the whole thing in a
couple of days.\\
377 - Oh, now, honey, don't worry.\\
378 - He'll remember them all right.\\
379 - Now, suppose that he doesn't remember
them all right?\\
380 - Well, so what can happen?\\
381 - There will always be one of us--\\
382 - you or me or Fred or Ethel-- close by
to help him.\\
383 - Now, don't worry about it.\\
384 - Now, Little Ricky, this is the end.\\
385 - Suzy is sitting there\\
386 - reading the book about the Enchanted
Forest,\\
387 - and she comes to the end of the
story.\\
388 - What do we do?\\
389 - "...and after the mean old witch\\
390 - "recited the code of the Enchanted
Forest,\\
391 - "the Fairy Princess waved her wand\\
392 - "and there was dancing and singing\\
393 - and everyone lived happily ever
after."\\
394 - Sometime, wouldn't you like to visit\\
395 - the Enchanted Forest, Billy?\\
396 - I said, "Sometime, wouldn't you like\\
397 - to visit the Enchanted Forest,
Billy?"\\
398 - Good.\\
399 - Good. Maybe, if we go right to sleep,\\
400 - we'll visit the Enchanted Forest in
our dreams.\\
401 - Look! This must be the Enchanted
Forest.\\
402 - Isn't this a beautiful forest?\\
403 - The most beautiful forest I ever saw.\\
404 - I sure would love to live here.\\
405 - Wouldn't you?\\
406 - I'd love to live here,
too.\\
407 - I'd love to live here, too.\\
408 - Thanks, Daddy.\\
409 - The bunnies!\\
410 - The bunnies, Billy!\\
411 - Weren't the gnomes and bunnies
adorable?\\
412 - Yes. And here comes Hippity-Hoppity
the frog.\\
413 - Where?\\
414 - Right over there.\\
415 - Hello, children.\\
416 - Hello.
Hello.\\
417 - You must be Hippity-Hoppity.\\
418 - That's right.\\
419 - What's your name, little girl?\\
420 - I'm Suzy Brown,\\
421 - and this is my brother.\\
422 - Well, hello, young fella.\\
423 - What's your name?\\
424 - My name is, uh, um...\\
425 - My name is, uh, um...\\
426 - Huh?\\
427 - I can't hear ya.\\
428 - Billy Brown!\\
429 - Oh, yeah.\\
430 - My name is Billy Brown.\\
431 - We were just saying,\\
432 - we sure would love to live here.\\
433 - That's right, Hippity-Hoppity.\\
434 - Can we live in the Enchanted Forest?\\
435 - Why, sure, but there's one thing\\
436 - you've got to be careful about.\\
437 - You mean the witch?\\
438 - Yes, because she doesn't like little
children.\\
439 - So you've got to hide behind the
magic tree\\
440 - when you see her.\\
441 - Then you'll be safe.\\
442 - We'll remember.\\
443 - Thanks for telling us, Hippity.\\
444 - You're welcome.\\
445 - What's that?\\
446 - Why, those are our friends
the three wise owls.\\
447 - It's the witch!\\
448 - Hurry! Hide!\\
449 - Aha!\\
450 - I see you, children.\\
451 - You come out from behind that tree!\\
452 - No! Never!\\
453 - This is a magic tree.\\
454 - You can't hurt us here.\\
455 - All right, then.
If you won't come out,\\
456 - then I'm gonna put a curse on your
friend Hippity-Hoppity.\\
457 - Hippity-bippity...\\
458 - No! Don't do that!\\
459 - Don't hurt our friend!\\
460 - All right, then, you come with me.\\
461 - No! Never!\\
462 - Why not?\\
463 - Do you know who I am, little boy?\\
464 - I say, do you know who I am?\\
465 - Sure. You're my mommy.\\
466 - Uh-uh.\\
467 - You are the witch.\\
468 - But I'm not the witch.\\
469 - I'm Billy Brown.\\
470 - Ai-yi-yi-yi.\\
471 - If you're not gonna come with me,\\
472 - then I'm gonna take you with me!\\
473 - Oh, it's the Fairy Princess.\\
474 - Do not be frightened, little
children.\\
475 - Nothing can harm you now that I am
here.\\
476 - Run to the frog.\\
477 - And now,\\
478 - so that the witch cannot harm\\
479 - little children anymore,\\
480 - I'm going to wave my magic wand\\
481 - and banish her from the Enchanted
Forest forever.\\
482 - Vanish, old witch!\\
483 - Vanish!\\
484 - Come here.\\
485 - And, now that the wicked witch has
been banished,\\
486 - we can all live in the Enchanted
Forest\\
487 - happily ever af-after.\\
488 - Can't the witch ever come back?\\
489 - Only if she promises to start loving
little children\\
490 - instead of hating them,\\
491 - and she must be a good witch\\
492 - and live by the code of the Enchanted
Forest.\\
493 - Give her another chance, Fairy
Princess.\\
494 - Yes, please give her another chance.\\
495 - Yeah. Why don't you give the kid a
break?\\
496 - All right, if it will make you all
happy.\\
497 - Reappear\\
498 - Reappear\\
499 - Return, old witch\\
500 - And come back here.\\
501 - What do you want?\\
502 - We may let you stay.\\
503 - Oh, let me stay, Fairy Princess.\\
504 - Let me stay.\\
505 - Only if you promise to be a good
witch.\\
506 - I promise to be a good witch.\\
507 - And you have to start loving little
children.\\
508 - I will.\\
509 - And you have to recite the code\\
510 - of the Enchanted Forest.\\
511 - I will!
I will! I will!\\
512 - Come, gnomes!\\
513 - Come, bunnies!\\
514 - Oh, come on, everybody!\\
515 - Gather round!\\
516 - Come on, everybody!\\
517 - I promise to be good and kind and
gentle,\\
518 - and to love little children\\
519 - and all the birds, the trees, and the
flowers and the animals,\\
520 - and I promise to, uh...\\
521 - uh...\\
522 - I promise to, uh...\\
523 - Promise to laugh and sing and spread
joy and happiness.\\
524 - Oh. Thanks, dear.\\
525 - I promise to laugh and sing and
spread joy and happiness,\\
526 - and I promise never to cast an evil
spell as long as I live.\\
527 - And now, let there be dancing and
singing.\\
528 - Hi-dee-dee\\
529 - Di-da-di.\\
530 - The witch has changed from bad
to good\\
531 - And now she's acting like she should\\
532 - She loves each child eternally\\
533 - And she loves you and you and me...\\
534 - And now the...
\subsection {Episode 11: Christmas Show (1956)}
1 - And now, "I Love Lucy."\\
2 - How's it here, honey?\\
3 - Over to the left a little.\\
4 - No, no, the other way.\\
5 - No, I want it in the middle\\
6 - so the mantle won't look lopsided.\\
7 - Santa Claus doesn't care if the
mantle looks lopsided.\\
8 - Oh, well.\\
9 - There you are, partner.\\
10 - Thank you, Daddy.\\
11 - You're welcome.\\
12 - Now, when you get up in the morning,
honey,\\
13 - Santa Claus is going to have that
chock full of goodies.\\
14 - Yes, sir.\\
15 - Now, off to bed, son.\\
16 - In a minute, Daddy.\\
17 - What are you doing, dear?\\
18 - I'm waiting for Santy Claus.\\
19 - You've got to go to bed now.\\
20 - I'll go to bed after Santa Claus gets
here.\\
21 - But, honey,\\
22 - Santa Claus is not going to come and
bring the tree\\
23 - and the presents and everything\\
24 - until you go to sleep.\\
25 - He won't?\\
26 - No.\\
27 - Why, Mommy?\\
28 - Yeah, why is that, Daddy?\\
29 - Why?\\
30 - Uh, why?\\
31 - Well, uh,\\
32 - you see, um...\\
33 - partner, Santa Claus comes\\
34 - all the way down from the North Pole\\
35 - and he has all these reindeers with
him.\\
36 - And when he gets here,\\
37 - he circles around in the sky\\
38 - until he gets a signal.\\
39 - Now, you know who gives him the
signal?\\
40 - Who?
Yeah, who?\\
41 - The San... the Sandman, that's right.\\
42 - Yeah, the Sandman gives him the
signal.\\
43 - That's right.\\
44 - When all the little children are in
bed,\\
45 - the Sandman runs up to the roof\\
46 - and he says, "Santa Claus, all
clear!"\\
47 - So you got to go to bed.\\
48 - Why, honey, that's fascinating.\\
49 - You see, young man?\\
50 - You got to go to bed right now.\\
51 - Okay, Mommy.\\
52 - Good boy.\\
53 - Mommy.\\
54 - What?\\
55 - There aren't any steps.\\
56 - How does Santa Claus get down the
chimney?\\
57 - Yeah, how does he do that, Daddy?\\
58 - Well, I took care of the "why" and
the "who."\\
59 - You take care of the "how."\\
60 - Uh... how, huh?\\
61 - Well, um...
now, you see,\\
62 - Santa Claus doesn't need any steps,
honey.\\
63 - He, he...\\
64 - When he comes, he brings the North
Pole with him\\
65 - and he slides down like a fireman.\\
66 - Oh.\\
67 - Good, good, good.\\
68 - All right, son, off to bed.\\
69 - Yeah, come on, honey.\\
70 - Good night.\\
71 - Night, Daddy.\\
72 - Good night.\\
73 - Fred, Ethel, come on.\\
74 - Come on in.\\
75 - Where do you want it?\\
76 - Right there, Fred.
Wait a minute.\\
77 - I'll show you.
I'll show you.\\
78 - I think right about in here.\\
79 - Oh, it's a beauty, Fred.\\
80 - How much do I owe you?\\
81 - It's from us.\\
82 - Well, that's very generous of you.\\
83 - Oh, it was nothing.\\
84 - Nothing? The tree cost five bucks.\\
85 - Well, it's Christmas Eve, all right.\\
86 - The children are tucked in their beds\\
87 - waiting for Santa Claus,\\
88 - the stockings are hung by the chimney
with care,\\
89 - and we have our very own Scrooge.\\
90 - Look, honey!\\
91 - Oh, that is a beautiful tree.
Isn't it?\\
92 - It's a present from me and Ebenezer.\\
93 - Well, thank you very much.\\
94 - Would you lay off, Ethel?\\
95 - Anyway, I thought Santy Claus was
supposed\\
96 - to foot the bill for the tree.\\
97 - Well, he does ordinarily,\\
98 - but this year, we're doing it for
him.\\
99 - You just try and think of yourself\\
100 - as one of Santa's little helpers.\\
101 - Well, I'll try.
Okay.\\
102 - Come on. Let's get the tree trimmed.\\
103 - Yes.
Okay.\\
104 - Honey?
What?\\
105 - Is it right where you want it?\\
106 - Back by the window a little bit.\\
107 - Oh, okay. Here.\\
108 - Come on.
You help me, Ethel.\\
109 - Yes, ma'am.
Be very careful with these now.\\
110 - These are the only bulbs that I have.\\
111 - All right.\\
112 - You take that box there.\\
113 - Oh, I love doing this.\\
114 - Isn't this wonderful?\\
115 - Honey?
Yes, dear?\\
116 - See how it looks from the front, eh?\\
117 - What do you think?\\
118 - Well, it looks pretty good, except
there's a branch\\
119 - on the right side that spoils the
shape.\\
120 - Which one, honey?\\
121 - This one right up here.\\
122 - Fred, would you go down to the
basement\\
123 - and get your saw and cut that off for
me?\\
124 - It's a little unbalanced.\\
125 - Oh, now, honey,\\
126 - maybe we can hang something there.\\
127 - He doesn't have to go all the way
down\\
128 - to the basement and get a saw.\\
129 - Now, look, honey, the tree has
to be balanced.\\
130 - You know that.\\
131 - We can't have one branch out like...\\
132 - I've been putting up trees with that
kid\\
133 - for the last 15 years.\\
134 - He came prepared.\\
135 - That's right, Fred.\\
136 - Gee, the four of us have spent\\
137 - a lot of Christmases together,
haven't we?\\
138 - We sure have.\\
139 - Yes, sir, and it's been great.\\
140 - It's even been better since little
Ricky came along.\\
141 - That's right, honey.\\
142 - Oh, Fred, now that you've cut that
branch off,\\
143 - it makes the other side look too
full.\\
144 - You better trim that branch\\
145 - on the other side, make it all even.\\
146 - You know, honey,\\
147 - I've been thinking.\\
148 - Our life has sure been different\\
149 - since you told me you were going to
have the baby.\\
150 - I almost never got to tell you.\\
151 - What do you mean?\\
152 - Don't you remember?\\
153 - Oh, Fred, that skinny branch on the
top\\
154 - just looks awful.\\
155 - It's going to have to come off.\\
156 - Don't you remember, Ricky?\\
157 - I tried to tell you all day,\\
158 - and I never got a chance because you
were so busy?\\
159 - Oh, now the other side looks uneven.\\
160 - That lower branch there.\\
161 - Honey, finally, in desperation,\\
162 - I had to go down to the club\\
163 - while you were working and give a
note\\
164 - to the maitre 'd for you.\\
165 - Thank you.\\
166 - Thank you very much, ladies and
gentlemen.\\
167 - Thank you.
And now for the...\\
168 - For you, Ricky.\\
169 - Oh, thank you.
Excuse me.\\
170 - Pardon me, please.\\
171 - Oh, isn't this wonderful?\\
172 - Listen to this.\\
173 - "Dear Mr. Ricardo,\\
174 - "My husband and I are going to have a
blessed event.\\
175 - "I just found out about it today,\\
176 - "and I haven't told him yet.\\
177 - "I heard you sing a number called\\
178 - "'We're Having a Baby, My Baby and
Me.'\\
179 - "If you will sing it for us now,\\
180 - it will be my way of breaking the
news to him."\\
181 - Isn't that wonderful?\\
182 - Of course I'll do it for you.\\
183 - Sure. Eh, mae...?\\
184 - Oh, wait a minute.\\
185 - I got a wonderful idea.\\
186 - Why don't we bring the couple up
here,\\
187 - and I'll sing it right to them, eh?\\
188 - Come on, let's bring them up on the
floor.\\
189 - Come on, folks.\\
190 - Come on. We just want to wish you
luck.\\
191 - Who is it?\\
192 - Rock-a-bye, baby\\
193 - On the treetop...\\
194 - No?\\
195 - When the wind blows\\
196 - The cradle will rock...\\
197 - No?\\
198 - When the bough breaks\\
199 - The cradle will fall\\
200 - And down will come baby\\
201 - Cradle and all\\
202 - Rock-a-bye, baby\\
203 - On the...\\
204 - Hiya, honey.
Hi.\\
205 - On the treetop\\
206 - When the wind blows\\
207 - The cradle will fall\\
208 - When the bough breaks\\
209 - The cradle will fall\\
210 - An...\\
211 - Honey, honey...\\
212 - Honey, no.\\
213 - Yes.\\
214 - Really?
Yes.\\
215 - Why didn't you tell me?\\
216 - Well, you didn't give me a chance.\\
217 - Are you kidding?\\
218 - No. I tri...
It's me!\\
219 - I'm going to be a father!\\
220 - How about that?\\
221 - I want you to meet my mother.\\
222 - I mean, my wife, my wife.\\
223 - Do the baby song!\\
224 - What?\\
225 - Do the baby song!
Do the baby song!\\
226 - We're having a baby\\
227 - My baby and me\\
228 - You'll read it in Winchell\\
229 - That we're adding a limb\\
230 - To our family tree\\
231 - While pushing that carriage\\
232 - How proud I will be\\
233 - There's nothing like marriage\\
234 - Ask your father and mother\\
235 - And they'll agree\\
236 - He'll have toys\\
237 - Baby clothes\\
238 - He'll know he's come to the right
house\\
239 - By and by\\
240 - When he grows\\
241 - Maybe he'll live in the White
House...\\
242 - Really?\\
243 - And why not?\\
244 - Our future looks brighter\\
245 - But definitely\\
246 - We're having a baby...\\
247 - I bet he's going to look just like
you.\\
248 - Oh, I hope not.\\
249 - We're having a baby...\\
250 - I'll bet she'll speak with an accent
like you.\\
251 - She?\\
252 - Yeah.\\
253 - We're having a baby\\
254 - My baby...\\
255 - And... me.\\
256 - It's silly.\\
257 - It happened five years ago,\\
258 - and I'm crying all over again.\\
259 - It's okay, honey.
So am I.\\
260 - I'm crying, too.\\
261 - Me, too, but for a different reason.\\
262 - Fred, what have you done to that
tree?\\
263 - Well, I got so carried away with the
story,\\
264 - I forgot what I was doing.\\
265 - Oh, Fred, for heaven's sake.\\
266 - Well, you got to admit\\
267 - that it's even on both sides.\\
268 - Well, how do you think we're going to
trim that?\\
269 - Well, why can't we trim it\\
270 - with those branches I just cut off?\\
271 - Fred Mertz, you march right down to
the corner\\
272 - and get another tree.\\
273 - Okay, but who's going to pay for it?\\
274 - I will. I will.\\
275 - No, you won't.\\
276 - He will, and one word out of you,\\
277 - and I'll tell Santa Claus that you
were a bad little boy,\\
278 - and you won't get any presents.\\
279 - You can't squeal on me.\\
280 - I'm one of his helpers.\\
281 - Oh, get out of here.\\
282 - You might as well get the lights
ready, dear.\\
283 - Okay, honey.\\
284 - Gee, I just love this old ornament.\\
285 - It's been on our tree ever since I
can remember.\\
286 - Cascabeles, cascabeles\\
287 - Llenos de alegria All the way\\
288 - Oh what fun it is to ride\\
289 - In a one-horse open sleigh\\
290 - Jingle bells,
jingle bells\\
291 - Jingle all the way\\
292 - Oh...\\
293 - I don't know what's happened to my
voice lately.\\
294 - I don't seem to sing well anymore.\\
295 - Lately?\\
296 - Anymore?\\
297 - Now, that's not very nice.\\
298 - I grant you, my voice isn't quite
what it used to be.\\
299 - It's exactly what it used to be.\\
300 - That's, uh, what's wrong with it.\\
301 - Why do you say that?\\
302 - I used to sing quite well, as I
recall.\\
303 - Well, dear girl, then something is
wrong with your memory.\\
304 - What do you mean?\\
305 - Well, a few months after you told me\\
306 - that the baby was going to be born,\\
307 - you wanted to sing at the club in a
barbershop quartet.\\
308 - Oh, I remember that.\\
309 - Fred and I did that with you.
Right.\\
310 - Boy, that was a terrible evening.\\
311 - It was not.
It turned out very well.\\
312 - It was one of the most embarrassing
nights\\
313 - of my career.\\
314 - Well!\\
315 - I'll never forget it.\\
316 - The three of us started the number\\
317 - thinking George Watson was under the
sheet\\
318 - in the barber chair.\\
319 - Little did we know\\
320 - that the tuneless wonder was there
instead.\\
321 - In the evening, when I sit alone
a-dreamin'\\
322 - Of days gone by, love\\
323 - To me so dear...\\
324 - There's a picture that in fancy oft'
appearing\\
325 - Brings back the time, love\\
326 - When you were near...\\
327 - When you were near\\
328 - It is then I wonder where you are, me
darling\\
329 - And if your heart to me is still the
same\\
330 - For the sighing wind and nightingale
a-singin'\\
331 - Are breathing only\\
332 - Your own sweet name\\
333 - Your own sweet name\\
334 - Sweet Adeline\\
335 - Sweet Ad...\\
336 - My Adeline\\
337 - My Ade...\\
338 - At night, dear heart\\
339 - A...\\
340 - For you I pine\\
341 - For y...\\
342 - In all my dreams\\
343 - In all...\\
344 - Your fair face beams\\
345 - You're the flower\\
346 - Of my heart...\\
347 - Sweet Adeline...\\
348 - Sweet Adeline.\\
349 - That's it.
Yeah, that looks beautiful.\\
350 - Hey!
Hey, Fred!\\
351 - Isn't this a dandy?\\
352 - Oh, boy!\\
353 - Look at that; that's a beauty, Fred!\\
354 - Fred, that's better than the first
one.\\
355 - And the best thing of it is,\\
356 - because it's getting so late,\\
357 - they guy let me have it for a half a
buck.\\
358 - It has just been proven to Fred,\\
359 - once and for all, there is a Santy
Claus.\\
360 - You bet! And he also gave me some
mistletoe.\\
361 - Now don't go getting any wild ideas,
Ethel.\\
362 - I'll try to restrain myself.\\
363 - Oh, Fred, this tree is just perfect.\\
364 - Absolutely perfect.
Yeah!\\
365 - Except for this one little branch
right here.\\
366 - Now if you could just...\\
367 - No!
Oh, no you don't.\\
368 - Nothing doing.\\
369 - Okay, leave it alone.
All right.\\
370 - Hey, Fred, let me...\\
371 - help me put the lights on, eh?\\
372 - Sure.
Let me help, too, huh?\\
373 - Okay, here.
Oh, boy.\\
374 - Give me a strand.
Okay, Fred.\\
375 - Want to help me?
There you are.\\
376 - Fine, thanks.\\
377 - Ricky?\\
378 - Yeah, honey?\\
379 - Won't you give me just one little
hint\\
380 - about what you're giving me for
Christmas?\\
381 - You know, you're worse than your son.\\
382 - You'll find out tomorrow morning.\\
383 - I know, but I just want to think
about it.\\
384 - Come on, give me one little clue.\\
385 - All right, I'll give you one clue.\\
386 - Good, what is it?\\
387 - It's a gift.\\
388 - Oh!\\
389 - Merry Christmas, sweetheart.\\
390 - Merry Christmas, you great big
wonderful,\\
391 - adorable, lovable husband you.\\
392 - Do you love me?
Mm-hmm.\\
393 - How much?\\
394 - A lot, but not enough to tell you\\
395 - what your Christmas present is.\\
396 - Oh! Now what makes you think that's
what I wanted to know?\\
397 - And what is it?\\
398 - You'll find out tomorrow morning.\\
399 - Oh, all right.\\
400 - Freddy?\\
401 - Yeah?\\
402 - Go ahead.\\
403 - Go ahead and what?\\
404 - You know what this means, don't you?\\
405 - Yeah, it means you're an incurable
optimist.\\
406 - Oh, Fred!\\
407 - Honey, I'm only fooling.\\
408 - Merry Christmas!\\
409 - Ah, Merry Christmas,\\
410 - you great big adorable husband!\\
411 - All right, Fred, plug in the lights\\
412 - and see if they work.\\
413 - Hey!\\
414 - Hey!\\
415 - Fred, congratulations.\\
416 - This is the only time that the lights
have worked\\
417 - on the first time in 15 years.\\
418 - We usually have to spend an hour\\
419 - testing all the bulbs\\
420 - to see which one hasn't burned...\\
421 - Out.\\
422 - Okay, let's start testing the bulbs.\\
423 - You know, I'm kind of glad it
happened.\\
424 - It makes it seem more like Christmas.\\
425 - Girls, why don't you get the
ornaments, huh?\\
426 - Oh, yeah, come on, this is the part I
love.\\
427 - What's little Ricky getting this
year?\\
428 - Well, I don't know what Santa Claus
is going to bring him,\\
429 - but we're getting him a new set of
drums and a bike.\\
430 - Hmm!\\
431 - Yeah, we're probably spoiling him,\\
432 - but he won't be little for long.\\
433 - Gee, it's amazing how much he's
grown.\\
434 - Seems like only yesterday that he was
born.\\
435 - Will you ever forget that night?\\
436 - I had a new show at the club,\\
437 - and Lucy insisted that I make it,\\
438 - and I was going crazy trying to be in
two places at once.\\
439 - Well, it wasn't any picnic for me,
either,\\
440 - waiting at that hospital while you
were doing the show.\\
441 - Well, what about me?\\
442 - I thought I'd lose my mind\\
443 - sitting at home, waiting for the
news.\\
444 - Of course, I was lucky.\\
445 - All I had to do was have the baby.\\
446 - You're right, honey.\\
447 - You three were so nervous that night.\\
448 - I remember, it was almost time for me
to go to the hospital,\\
449 - and you all sat and watched me\\
450 - like I was going to explode any
minute.\\
451 - Is it really due any minute?!\\
452 - How do you feel?!\\
453 - Are you sure you're all right?!\\
454 - I think we ought to have a rehearsal.\\
455 - A rehearsal? For what?\\
456 - A rehearsal for when you get the
signal.\\
457 - Everything should go like clockwork.\\
458 - I don't want to lose a minute\\
459 - getting you to the hospital.\\
460 - Oh, that's a wonderful idea.
He's right, he's right.\\
461 - Now, Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, there's no
problem, dear.\\
462 - The room is reserved at the hospital.\\
463 - The doctor's number's right here by
the phone.\\
464 - My suitcase is all packed.\\
465 - All we have to do is go downstairs,
get a cab and go.\\
466 - I know, I know, but who's going to
call the doctor?\\
467 - Who's going to carry the suitcase?\\
468 - Who's going to hail the cab?\\
469 - That's what we got to rehearse.\\
470 - Rick, I'll do anything you suggest.\\
471 - Hey, hold it, hold it, group.\\
472 - Look, you split it up any way you
want.\\
473 - I'm going to go lie down.\\
474 - All right, honey, I think that's a
good idea.\\
475 - You need your rest.
Here, I'll help you, dear.\\
476 - That's nice.\\
477 - Come on, honey.\\
478 - Don't you worry about anything now.\\
479 - No, I won't.\\
480 - You leave everything to us, honey.\\
481 - Okay.\\
482 - Take it easy.\\
483 - Now, listen, Rick,\\
484 - I'll tell you how we ought to do
this.\\
485 - Now, wait a... wait a...
now, wait a minute,\\
486 - wait a minute, I'm in charge of this
thing.\\
487 - After all, I'm the baby's father.\\
488 - Take over, captain.\\
489 - All right.
Now, let's see now.\\
490 - First of all, one of us has to call
the doctor.\\
491 - Who's going to do that?\\
492 - I'll do that.\\
493 - Okay. Soon as we get the signal,\\
494 - you rush to the phone.\\
495 - Okay.\\
496 - All right.
Now, you carry the suitcase.\\
497 - Right.\\
498 - I'll look after Lucy.\\
499 - I'll get her coat, see that she gets
downstairs all right,\\
500 - and we'll hail a cab.\\
501 - Now let's rehearse.\\
502 - Okay.
Good.\\
503 - Okay. Let's go.\\
504 - Now... let's make believe\\
505 - that Lucy just came out of the
bedroom, see?\\
506 - And she comes out of the bedroom\\
507 - and she says, "The time has come."\\
508 - Go!\\
509 - Hello, Dr. Harris.\\
510 - We're leaving for the hospital with
Mrs. Ricardo now.\\
511 - Good-bye.\\
512 - Hey, that was pretty good.\\
513 - We did that in a few seconds.\\
514 - Fine.
Well, now, let's do it again\\
515 - so we'll have everything perfect.\\
516 - Okay, now, the main thing is to be
calm\\
517 - so we don't get Lucy excited.\\
518 - That's right.
We got to keep calm.
Good.\\
519 - Put that over there so we can start
right where we were.\\
520 - Get it over there and...\\
521 - Get it all where it was at the
beginning, now.\\
522 - Go back over there now.\\
523 - Right.\\
524 - Are you ready?\\
525 - Yep.
Yep.\\
526 - Okay.\\
527 - Now, Lucy comes out of the room,\\
528 - and she says, "The time has come."\\
529 - Go!\\
530 - Hello, Dr. Harris.\\
531 - We're leaving for the hospital with
Mrs. Ricardo now.\\
532 - Good-bye.\\
533 - Hey, that was even better than
before.\\
534 - Sure it was!\\
535 - Yeah, that was wonderful.\\
536 - Fine.
Well organized.\\
537 - Okay, now we know what to do.\\
538 - Now, let's put this stuff right where
it was\\
539 - so we know where everything is.\\
540 - Now all we have to do is just
wait.\\
541 - That was fine, kids.
That was wonderful.\\
542 - Just think...\\
543 - ...tomorrow night at this time, I'm
going to be a father.\\
544 - Yes, sir, and I'm going to be a
godfather.\\
545 - And I'm going to be a godmother.\\
546 - Uh-huh.\\
547 - Ricky, this is it.\\
548 - This is it.
This is it!
This is it!\\
549 - Let's go!\\
550 - Come on! Let's get going!\\
551 - Somebody better call the doctor.\\
552 - Call the doctor!\\
553 - No. That's my job!
That's my job!\\
554 - You get the suitcase!\\
555 - The suitcase!
Suitcase!\\
556 - I got it, Fred!\\
557 - Give me the suitcase!\\
558 - We have to hurry, Ricky!\\
559 - We have to hurry, she says!\\
560 - Oh! The line is busy!
Ricky!\\
561 - The line's busy!
The line is busy?\\
562 - Why doesn't somebody go hail the cab,\\
563 - and then you call Dr. Harris.
Go! Go get a cab!\\
564 - Go get the cab!\\
565 - Go get a cab!
Go get a cab!\\
566 - I'll get the cab!\\
567 - I'll get the cab!
I'll get the cab!\\
568 - Hey! Wait for me!\\
569 - For heaven's sake.\\
570 - Why didn't we get together on this?\\
571 - The four of us sure got the same idea
at once.\\
572 - We sure did.\\
573 - Mommy, Daddy,\\
574 - is it time to get up?\\
575 - He can't find four of us here.\\
576 - Come on, go in the kitchen.\\
577 - Yeah.\\
578 - Oh, boy!\\
579 - Listen, as long as we've gone to this
much trouble,\\
580 - one of us ought to go in there and
let Little Ricky see us.\\
581 - Yeah.\\
582 - That's right.\\
583 - Boy, you've got to get up early\\
584 - if you want to be Santa Claus around
here.\\
585 - Just a minute.\\
586 - Ouch!\\
587 - Merry Christmas, everybody.

64 - Uh-huh!\\
65 - Come on, honey, open up.\\
66 - Let's see what you bought.\\
67 - Okay.
Oh, listen, dear.\\
68 - I have a lot of business to do uptown\\
69 - before I go to the banquet,\\
70 - and I don't want to lug that cup
around with me,\\
71 - so will you bring it down?\\
72 - Sure, honey.
Now, look.\\
73 - The banquet starts at 7:00, so don't
be late.\\
74 - No, I won't be late, dear.
All right.\\
75 - Come on, let me see your new dress!\\
76 - All right, calm down.\\
77 - You're acting like you never saw a
new dress before.\\
78 - Who's acting?\\
79 - How do you like it?\\
80 - Oh, it's gorgeous!\\
81 - Honey, how do you like it?\\
82 - Oh, it's beautiful.\\
83 - Looks like a million dollars.\\
84 - That's probably what it cost.\\
85 - It was only 49.95.\\
86 - To him, that's a million dollars.\\
87 - Honeybunch, can I help it\\
88 - if I think of you as my dungaree
doll?\\
89 - Ethel, wait till you see my new hat.\\
90 - Let me see.
It's the smartest thing you ever saw.\\
91 - Come on, let me see it.
Let me see it.\\
92 - Well, you really have to see it on to
appreciate it,\\
93 - so close your eyes, everybody.\\
94 - All right.\\
95 - Open your eyes, everybody.\\
96 - Close your eyes, everybody.\\
97 - Oh, Fred, shut up.\\
98 - Honey, it's adorable.\\
99 - How do you like it, dear?\\
100 - Well, it's uh... uh...\\
101 - What are you laughing at?\\
102 - Oh, honey,\\
103 - that's the funniest thing I ever
seen.\\
104 - I'll say it is.\\
105 - Looks like you're wearing a fuzzy
fishbowl.\\
106 - Now, honey,\\
107 - don't you pay any attention to them.\\
108 - It's divine.\\
109 - Yeah, who cares what they think?\\
110 - They don't know what's smart.\\
111 - Well, I may not know what's smart,\\
112 - but I know what's funny.\\
113 - And that's funny.\\
114 - I don't care what you think.\\
115 - It may interest you two hyenas\\
116 - to know that this is the latest style
from Paris.\\
117 - Oh, no.\\
118 - I think it's the end, the very end.\\
119 - The end of what?\\
120 - I don't care what you think,\\
121 - I'm gonna wear it to the dinner
tonight.\\
122 - Oh-ho, no, you're not.\\
123 - My wife is not gonna look ridiculous\\
124 - in front of all those people.\\
125 - I do not look ridiculous.\\
126 - You do, too.\\
127 - You'll be better off wearing...\\
128 - wearing that trophy on your head.\\
129 - You wouldn't look half as funny.\\
130 - Well, honey, all the new hats look
like this.\\
131 - Well, then, wear one of your old
hats.\\
132 - Wear an old hat to the banquet\\
133 - in front of Johnny Longden and his
wife and everybody?\\
134 - Look, Lucy, I don't care what you
wear,\\
135 - but don't wear that.
Mommy.\\
136 - I gotta go.
What dear?\\
137 - I need a bigger box for my turtle.\\
138 - A bigger box?\\
139 - Oh, wait just a minute.
I'll get you one, honey.\\
140 - Now, Ricky, I'm giving you one last
chance.\\
141 - Can I wear this hat?\\
142 - I'm giving you one last answer-- no.\\
143 - Hey, this is a swell new house for my
turtle.\\
144 - Hey, stop him!\\
145 - He can't put his turtle\\
146 - in that thin'.\\
147 - Oh, Ricky, Ricky, honey, come here,
dear.\\
148 - You can't put your turtle in that
thin'.\\
149 - Isn't that funny, Fred?\\
150 - Women will buy anything if it's in
fashion.\\
151 - They certainly will.\\
152 - How would you know?\\
153 - You haven't bought me anything since
bloomers were in style.\\
154 - Oh, good grief.\\
155 - Ethel, if you're gonna play that same
old tune\\
156 - on your player piano, I'm going home.\\
157 - Well, twenty-three skidoo.\\
158 - I'll see you later, Fred.\\
159 - All right.\\
160 - Honey, I'll see you\\
161 - down at the banquet!
I gotta go.\\
162 - Wait a minute, dear.\\
163 - I want you to see the hat that I
decided to wear.\\
164 - Okay, honey.\\
165 - Now, what do you think you're doing?\\
166 - You said I might as well wear this,
and I think I will.\\
167 - Very, very funny.\\
168 - Now, take that thing off your head\\
169 - and bring it down to the club in
time.\\
170 - Oh...
Good-bye.\\
171 - Hey, you're cold.\\
172 - That was a nice try, girl.\\
173 - Yeah.
I'll see you later.\\
174 - I got a lot to do.\\
175 - Ethel...\\
176 - Ethel, help me get out of this,\\
177 - will you? It's a little tight.\\
178 - Oh... Ooh! Ooh!\\
179 - Oh, Ethel, I think it's stuck.\\
180 - Oh, this could only happen to you.\\
181 - What did you say?\\
182 - This could only happen to you.\\
183 - Speak up. I can't hear in this thing.\\
184 - This could only hap...\\
185 - Oh, don't shout.
It echoes in here.\\
186 - Oh, honey, I'm sorry.\\
187 - Here. Come here, honey.\\
188 - Now, now, just bend over.\\
189 - I'll, I'll get some...\\
190 - Okay. Ready?\\
191 - Ethel!\\
192 - Oh, Lucy, it won't come off!\\
193 - What am I gonna do?\\
194 - Well, we could always butter your
head.\\
195 - Now, let's not be funny.\\
196 - I gotta get this thing off.
Now, think.\\
197 - Okay.\\
198 - Oh, gosh.\\
199 - Of all the things.\\
200 - Are you thinking, Ethel?\\
201 - Yeah, I'm thinking.\\
202 - What are you laughing at?\\
203 - Oh, you don't know how funny you look
in that thing.\\
204 - Well, this is no laughing matter.
Now, think.\\
205 - Oh, all right.\\
206 - Lucy, does heat make metal contract
or expand?\\
207 - I think it makes it expand. Why?\\
208 - Then that's it. We'll stick your head
in the oven.\\
209 - In the oven?!\\
210 - Yeah. The trophy will get bigger,\\
211 - and then your head will be free.\\
212 - Oh, great. Why don't you put an apple
in my mouth\\
213 - and barbecue me?\\
214 - I guess it wouldn't work, huh?\\
215 - No, I guess it wouldn't work.\\
216 - Hey, I got another idea.\\
217 - It'd better be better than your last
one.\\
218 - Wait a minute now.\\
219 - Just a second.\\
220 - Ah! Oh! What are you doing, Ethel?!\\
221 - I'm trying to loosen it like the lid
on a jar.\\
222 - Oh, cut it out, Ethel!\\
223 - You're giving me a headache.\\
224 - Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
Oh!\\
225 - Boy, this is a tough one.\\
226 - Ethel, are you gonna stay over here
all winter?\\
227 - Oh, Fred, come here and see if you
can help us.\\
228 - Wait till I tell the boys in my old
outfit\\
229 - that the Kaiser is still alive.\\
230 - This is no time for your corny jokes.\\
231 - We can't get that thing off of Lucy's
head.\\
232 - You gotta be kidding.\\
233 - I am not kidding.\\
234 - Now, honey, honey, don't cry.\\
235 - It'll only make things worse.\\
236 - Yeah, it might get the trophy rusty.\\
237 - Fred, what are we gonna do?\\
238 - Well, we could get a silversmith\\
239 - and cut it off with a blowtorch.\\
240 - A blowtorch?!\\
241 - Or whatever they use.\\
242 - Then you can weld it back together
again.\\
243 - Oh, dear. Can't you think of an
easier way?\\
244 - You'd better think fast,\\
245 - or you'll wind up wearing it to the
banquet.\\
246 - He's right, honey. You haven't got
much time.\\
247 - Oh, no... What time is it, Ethel?\\
248 - It's 5:30.\\
249 - Oh, I'd better call the silversmith,\\
250 - tell him to come over right away.\\
251 - I'll do it, I'll do it for you,
honey.\\
252 - A silversmith, a silversmith...\\
253 - I'm not even gonna ask you how this
happened.\\
254 - Thank you.\\
255 - What are you doing?\\
256 - What are you doing, Fred?\\
257 - You can't give Johnny Longden a
trophy\\
258 - all full of fingerprints.\\
259 - Oh, sit down now.\\
260 - Hello. Is this the silversmith?\\
261 - Can you get a loving cup off of a
woman's head?\\
262 - Huh?\\
263 - Oh, well, she bought a new hat, and I
thought it was...\\
264 - Oh, never mind how she got it on
there.\\
265 - Can you come up here and get it off?\\
266 - Oh, well, now, just a minute.\\
267 - Lucy, he's gonna close his shop in a
half an hour,\\
268 - and he says if you want him to take
it off,\\
269 - you'll have to come down there.\\
270 - Go down there?\\
271 - How am I gonna get there?\\
272 - I'll take you.\\
273 - Oh, all right.\\
274 - All right. She'll be right down.\\
275 - Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.\\
276 - Huh?\\
277 - Oh, you won't have any trouble
recognizing her.\\
278 - Lucy, his shop's way down on Bleecker
Street,\\
279 - so you'll have to go right from there\\
280 - to the banquet.\\
281 - Oh, oh, Fred, Fred...\\
282 - Yeah?
Oh, ooh, Fred,\\
283 - run down and hail a taxi for us right
away.\\
284 - All right.\\
285 - Just a minute.\\
286 - Honey, a taxi will take too much
time.\\
287 - The subway will be faster.\\
288 - I can't go on a subway like this.\\
289 - Do you want to get to that banquet or
don't you?\\
290 - Oh, all right, all right.\\
291 - Fred... Is Fred gone?\\
292 - Answer her!\\
293 - Oh, I'm here!\\
294 - Fred, Fred, would you stay with
Little Ricky.\\
295 - You can finish reading Cinderella to
him.\\
296 - Yeah, I'll go and get my specs.\\
297 - I can hardly wait to see who that
glass slipper belongs to.\\
298 - Honey, I'd better go change my
clothes, too.\\
299 - I can't go on a subway dressed like
this.\\
300 - Well, if I can go like this,\\
301 - you certainly can go like that.\\
302 - In my blue jeans?\\
303 - Ethel, with a loving cup on my head,\\
304 - I hardly think anybody will be
looking at your blue jeans.\\
305 - Lucy, I have never ridden on a subway
in my blue jeans,\\
306 - and I'm not gonna start now.\\
307 - Okay.\\
308 - Oh, boy, I look terrible.\\
309 - What on earth are you trying to do
now?\\
310 - If I have to go from the
silversmith's to the banquet,\\
311 - I want to wear my new dress.\\
312 - Oh, well, let me try to help you,
honey.\\
313 - Uh, get over here.\\
314 - Over here, Lucy.\\
315 - I'll get up on the couch\\
316 - so I can... I can pull it better from
there.\\
317 - Here, honey. Right here.\\
318 - Turn around.\\
319 - Ready, set... go!\\
320 - Ahh!\\
321 - Oh, Ethel!\\
322 - Oh, Lucy, we can't get it up over
that loving cup.\\
323 - I want to wear my new dress.\\
324 - Okay, honey, we'll take your dress
along\\
325 - and you can change down there.\\
326 - Oh, okay.\\
327 - Say... we'd better get a big hat or
something\\
328 - to cover that thing in the subway.\\
329 - A big hat?\\
330 - Yeah. You got one?\\
331 - There might be one in the box in the
closet.\\
332 - Okay, I'll look.\\
333 - Right there.
Stay right there.\\
334 - Ethel, are people staring at me?\\
335 - No, they're not paying much attention
to you.\\
336 - What'd you say?\\
337 - I said they're not staring at you.\\
338 - You'll have to speak up, honey.\\
339 - With this hat and the cup and the
veil and everything,\\
340 - I can't hear you.\\
341 - I said they're not
staring at you!\\
342 - Ethel, are you still there?\\
343 - Yeah, I'm still here. Why?\\
344 - Well, I have a feeling you're trying
to pretend\\
345 - you're not with me.\\
346 - I'm right here beside you.\\
347 - Okay.\\
348 - What are you staring at?\\
349 - Haven't you ever seen a beekeeper\\
350 - on a subway before?\\
351 - Smart aleck.
Who was it?\\
352 - Just some smart aleck.\\
353 - What did he say?
He's going away.\\
354 - He's going away.
Did he go away?\\
355 - This is Bleecker Street, honey.\\
356 - Here's where we get off.\\
357 - Come on.\\
358 - Ethel, are we on or off?\\
359 - Ethel?\\
360 - Ethel!\\
361 - Ooh, pardon me.\\
362 - Pardon me, sir.\\
363 - Very sorry, sir.\\
364 - Oh, excuse...\\
365 - Pardon me. Can you tell me\\
366 - where the stairs are?\\
367 - Well, you'd better get off the train
first.\\
368 - I am off.\\
369 - You're telling me.\\
370 - Oh, pardon me.\\
371 - Can you tell me where I am?\\
372 - Yeah. You're on Earth.\\
373 - Pardon me.\\
374 - Where am I?\\
375 - Where are you?\\
376 - What are you?\\
377 - What's the matter with everybody?\\
378 - Haven't you ever seen anybody\\
379 - with a loving cup on their head
before.\\
380 - No, I haven't,\\
381 - and I've lived in Brooklyn for 56
years.\\
382 - Brooklyn?
Am I in Brooklyn?\\
383 - Yes, you are.\\
384 - Flatbush Avenue.\\
385 - Oh, dear.\\
386 - Would you do a favor for me?\\
387 - Would you, would you make a telephone
call for me?\\
388 - There's something I have to tell my
husband.\\
389 - Yes, dearie, anything you say.\\
390 - Oh, thank you.\\
391 - If you would call Plaza 3-2099\\
392 - and ask for Ricky Ricardo-- he's my
husband--\\
393 - and tell him that I have the cup,\\
394 - but I put my foot in it again.\\
395 - I mean, I put my head in it.\\
396 - J-J-Just tell him I have the cup and
I'm on my way\\
397 - and tell Johnny Longden to hold his
horses.\\
398 - Hold his horses.\\
399 - Oh, boy, that's funny, isn't it?\\
400 - That's hilarious.\\
401 - Now, maybe it's a little hard for you
to understand,\\
402 - but my husband will understand.\\
403 - Now, if you'll just call Plaza
3-2099,\\
404 - ask for Ricky Ricardo\\
405 - and tell him Lucy's on the way with
the cup.\\
406 - Oh, dear, I can't find a dime.\\
407 - Just take what you need.\\
408 - Thanks, lady.\\
409 - Who's that?\\
410 - Where's that lady I was talking to?\\
411 - Where'd everybody go?\\
412 - Maybe it's a sorority initiation.\\
413 - Either that, or she played tennis\\
414 - with a sore loser.\\
415 - Would a policeman be of any help?\\
416 - Oh, good grief, no.\\
417 - Don't get a policeman.\\
418 - You know how nosy they are.\\
419 - Always asking those foolish questions\\
420 - and then instead of helping after
you've gone all...\\
421 - explaining for a half an hour,\\
422 - all they do is just mess things up.\\
423 - Don't get a policeman.\\
424 - Thank you very...\\
425 - Listen, if you could direct me to
a...\\
426 - If...\\
427 - Uh, yeah. Would, would, would you get
me\\
428 - one of those wonderful, kindhearted
policemen?\\
429 - One of those\\
430 - guardians of the law\\
431 - in this great city?\\
432 - One of those grand chaps that I...\\
433 - Just what do, what do you think
you're doing?\\
434 - Well, Officer, sir...\\
435 - You see, sir...\\
436 - Officer, sir...\\
437 - Uh... uh...\\
438 - Now, you're not gonna believe this...\\
439 - ...but a very funny thing happened to
me\\
440 - on the way to a banquet tonight.\\
441 - Now, ladies and gentlemen,\\

her head.\\
473 - That's my wife.\\
474 - You have my deepest sympathy.\\
475 - Thank you.\\
476 - Seems to be in a little mishap.\\
477 - Oh, no.\\
478 - I tried to get it off.\\
479 - Yes, that's all right, dear.\\
480 - There, this is the trophy, ladies and
gentlemen,\\
481 - right along with my wife, Lucy.\\

498 - I'm sure it will look good in my...
trophy... collection,\\
499 - but what am I gonna do with your
wife?\\
500 - Well, Johnny, that's been my problem\\
501 - for 15 years.
Now it's yours.\\

69 - Oh, come on.\\
70 - Who's coming over?\\
71 - Caroline and Charlie Appleby.\\
72 - Yeah. They were in the neighborhood
and called us.\\
73 - And we couldn't think of an excuse
fast enough,\\
74 - so they're dropping by.\\
75 - An excuse?\\
76 - I thought Caroline was a good friend
of yours.\\
77 - Oh, she is, but she's so boring.\\
78 - She's one of those mothers who's
always bragging about her child.\\
79 - Yeah, and Charlie's even worse.\\
80 - Her Stevie is so cute,\\
81 - Her Stevie is so sweet.\\
82 - Her Stevie is so smart.\\
83 - Ooh, I get so sick of it...\\
84 - Yeah.\\
85 - ...when everyone knows\\
86 - that Little Ricky is a lot cuter,\\
87 - a lot sweeter\\
88 - and certainly a lot smarter.\\
89 - Yeah.\\
90 - But for bores, they're really awfully
nice people,\\
91 - so I guess we can put up with them,
huh?\\
92 - Besides, Stevie's Little Ricky's best
friend.\\
93 - Yeah, that's right.\\
94 - Oh, I must remember to invite
Stevie\\
95 - to the party Saturday.\\
96 - Sure, you gotta invite him to the
party, honey.\\
97 - What are you looking for, dear?\\
98 - I'm looking for the new pictures I
took of Little Ricky.\\
99 - Oh.
Here they are.\\
100 - What do you want with them?\\
101 - Well, when Charlie Appleby starts to
bore me\\
102 - with his pictures of Little Stevie,\\
103 - I'm gonna be ready.\\
104 - Come on, Fred,\\
105 - let's get out of here.\\
106 - I don't want to stick around\\
107 - for the "bore war."\\
108 - Oh, come on.\\
109 - Thanks for the gifts.\\
110 - Oh, that's all right, honey.\\
111 - See you later, Rick.
Bye, Fred.\\
112 - Oh, I just love buying them.\\
113 - Don't mention it.\\
114 - Okay.
Bye.\\
115 - Good night.\\
116 - What's the matter with you, boy?\\
117 - I'm practicing.\\
118 - For once, I'm gonna beat Charlie
Appleby to the draw.\\
119 - Oh...\\
120 - And he picked up Marilyn Monroe,\\
121 - slung her over his shoulder and
carried her off.\\
122 - Oh, Caroline, that just sounds like a
wonderful movie.\\
123 - We have to see that, honey.\\
124 - Yeah.
Yeah, it was good all right.\\
125 - Say, do you realize we've been here\\
126 - almost an hour\\
127 - and not one of us has even mentioned
our children?\\
128 - You know you're absolutely right,
Charlie.\\
129 - Seems like whenever people\\
130 - with children get together,\\
131 - that's all they can talk about.\\
132 - Personally, I think it's a terrible
bore.\\
133 - Yeah, yeah, me, too.\\
134 - 'Course, every once in a while,\\
135 - Stevie does something so cute,\\
136 - I just can't resist telling about it.\\
137 - Like the other day,\\
138 - we, we were talking about his
birthday--\\
139 - he'll be five next week, you know--\\
140 - he came up to me\\
141 - and he said... he came up to me and
he said...\\
142 - he said, "Daddy, are you five years
old yet?"\\
143 - "Are you five years old yet?"\\
144 - Yeah.\\
145 - "Are you five years old yet?"\\
146 - That's very cute.\\
147 - Yeah, cute.\\
148 - Oh, say, speaking of birthdays,\\
149 - we want to invite Little Ricky to
Stevie's party.\\
150 - Well, thank you very much.\\
151 - We want to invite Stevie to Ricky's
party, too.\\
152 - Oh, well, good.
He'd love to come.\\
153 - I just remembered--\\
154 - the kids were born four days apart.\\
155 - That's right.\\
156 - Well, then we'll expect Little Ricky\\
157 - at 2:00 Saturday afternoon.\\
158 - That's fine. Saturday afternoon?\\
159 - That's when we're having Little
Ricky's party.\\
160 - Oh, my goodness, what a shame.\\
161 - Oh, this is awful.\\
162 - Well, honey, neither of the kids'
birthdays\\
163 - is really on Saturday,\\
164 - so one of us will change the day of
the party.\\
165 - Sure, and that way, all their little
friends\\
166 - can go to both parties.
Yeah.\\
167 - Well, that's a good idea.\\
168 - One of us will change.\\
169 - Yeah. One of us will have to change.\\
170 - What day are you gonna have your
party on, Caroline?\\
171 - Now, wait a minute, Lucy.\\
172 - I don't want Stevie's party another
day.\\
173 - Saturday's the best day; it's a
non-school day.\\
174 - But it makes much more sense for you
to change, Caroline.\\
175 - After all, Stevie's birthday isn't on
Saturday.\\
176 - It's on Thursday, isn't it?\\
177 - Well, so what?\\
178 - Little Ricky's birthday isn't till
next Monday.\\
179 - Well, Monday's much closer to
Saturday than Thursday.\\
180 - How do you figure?\\
181 - Well, Monday's all part of the
weekend--\\
182 - you know, Saturday, Sunday, Monday--\\
183 - but Thursday-- it's Thursday...
Friday... Saturday.\\
184 - Thursday is miles from Saturday.\\
185 - Oh, that's ridiculous.\\
186 - Thursday is just as close to Saturday
as Monday.\\
187 - Well...\\
188 - What time was Little Stevie born?\\
189 - 12:00 noon.\\
190 - Aha! Little Ricky was born at 11:00
in the morning.\\
191 - And 11:00 Monday is closer to 2:00
Saturday\\
192 - than 12:00 Thursday.\\
193 - So, you'll just have to change your
party, Caroline.\\
194 - Oh, now, wait, wait, Stevie was born
in California.\\
195 - That's Pacific standard time.
So, that means\\
196 - he actually would've been born\\
197 - three hours later in New York time...\\
198 - Well, if you're gonna drag in those
phony technicalities.\\
199 - Well, you're the one who started it.\\
200 - Well, we'll just see who'll change
their party, Caroline.\\
201 - Yeah, we'll just see.\\
202 - Yes, we will.\\
203 - All right, all right,\\
204 - now, girls, it's no use\\
205 - getting upset about nothing.\\
206 - Don't worry, you'll work something
out.\\
207 - Anyone care for a cigarette?\\
208 - Caroline?\\
209 - No, thank you.\\
210 - Lucy?\\
211 - No. Thank you.\\
212 - Ricky?\\
213 - Yes. Let's have a cigarette.\\
214 - Oh, I just remembered.\\
215 - I've got some new pictures here of
Stevie.\\
216 - Isn't that cute?\\
217 - Isn't that the cutest thing?\\
218 - ...about Pacific standard time.\\
219 - Ricky, what do you want for
breakfast, dear?\\
220 - Nothing, honey, I'm awful late.\\
221 - Okay.\\
222 - If there's one thing I can't stand\\
223 - is someone who's pigheaded.\\
224 - Now, it wouldn't have hurt her a bit\\
225 - to change her party to another day.\\
226 - Well, it wouldn't hurt you\\
227 - to change yours either.\\
228 - Whose side are you on?!\\
229 - Well, I'm in Little Ricky's camp.\\
230 - Well, all right.\\
231 - But why can't you both\\
232 - have your parties on Saturday?\\
233 - Because Stevie and Ricky are in the
same class at school,\\
234 - and they'll each be inviting the same
children.\\
235 - Well, can't you split the guest list
down the middle?\\
236 - No, that won't work.\\
237 - She's invited a clown, a magician.\\
238 - She's having a puppet show.\\
239 - All the little kids will want to go
to Stevie's party.\\
240 - Oh.\\
241 - Well, why don't you get some
entertainment\\
242 - that'll top Caroline's,\\
243 - and then they'll want to come to
Little Ricky's party.\\
244 - Who am I gonna get?\\
245 - Oh, boy, there goes Superman!\\
246 - Ethel, that's it!\\
247 - That's what?\\
248 - I'll get Superman for Ricky's party.\\
249 - How could you do that?\\
250 - Ricky'll get him for me.\\
251 - He met him when we were in Hollywood.\\
252 - And Superman's in town; I heard it on
television.\\
253 - Oh, boy, that'd be great.\\
254 - Wouldn't it?\\
255 - Honey, will you do me a favor?\\
256 - Will you call Superman this
afternoon?\\
257 - Sure, dear. Good-bye.\\
258 - Superman?!\\
259 - Yeah, for Ricky's party Saturday.\\
260 - Oh, oh.\\
261 - Oh, yeah, hey, that would be a
wonderful idea.\\
262 - Will you get him for me?\\
263 - Okay, honey, I'll call him\\
264 - the minute I get to the club.\\
265 - Okay, dear.
All right.\\
266 - Boy, imagine having a father who
knows Superman. Oh!\\
267 - How about that?
Ha, ha, ha!\\
268 - Hey, Ricky, guess what?\\
269 - You're gonna get your wish.\\
270 - Who do you think's coming to your
party Saturday? Superman!\\
271 - Oh, boy, oh, boy!\\
272 - Ha, ha!\\
273 - Hello.\\
274 - Hello, Caroline.\\
275 - Oh, hello, Lucy.\\
276 - How are you, dear?\\
277 - Fine, dear, and how are you?\\
278 - Fine. I'm calling about Little
Ricky's party Saturday.\\
279 - Oh. Look, Lucy, if you're determined\\
280 - to have Little Ricky's party on
Saturday,\\
281 - I'm afraid he's going to be awfully
lonesome.\\
282 - All the children seem so anxious\\
283 - to see the magician and the puppets
and the clowns.\\
284 - Yes, uh, Little Ricky was, too, until
he found out\\
285 - that Superman's going to be at his
party.\\
286 - Superman's coming to Little Ricky's
party?\\
287 - Uh-huh.
Superman? Oh, boy!\\
288 - Shh!\\
289 - I want to go to Little
Ricky's party.\\
290 - Now, listen, Stevie, you're
having a party of your own.\\
291 - I don't want a party.\\
292 - I want to go to Little Ricky's party.\\
293 - Now, now, Stevie.\\
294 - I want to see Superman, I want to see
Superman.\\
295 - Oh, Stevie, shh...\\
296 - Is that Little Stevie I hear?\\
297 - He sounds so cute.\\
298 - O-kay, Lucy, you win.\\
299 - We'll change our party.\\
300 - Well, if you insist, dear.\\
301 - See you Saturday, then.
Toodle-oo.\\
302 - Lucy!\\
303 - What?\\
304 - Will you hide my sterling silver for
me?\\
305 - Sure, but why?\\
306 - Oh, it's Fred.\\
307 - He's frantic because that apartment
next door\\
308 - is still empty.\\
309 - What's that got to do with this?\\
310 - He's getting that look in his eye\\
311 - that means he's gonna pawn the family
silver.\\
312 - Oh, Ethel, he wouldn't do that.\\
313 - Not your mother's flatware.\\
314 - He'd pawn me if I had a few more gold
fillings.\\
315 - Ethel, call the police!\\
316 - Somebody stole our silver.\\
317 - Oh, there it is.\\
318 - What did you want with it, Fred?\\
319 - Well, I-I noticed last thanksgiving\\
320 - that it was getting a little
tarnished,\\
321 - and I want to clean it.\\
322 - Oh, sure.\\
323 - Well, then give it to me so I can
clean it.\\
324 - Oh, no, nothing doing.\\
325 - Oh...\\
326 - Well, then what did you do with my
mandolin?\\
327 - It's downstairs in a box in the
basement.\\
328 - But you won't get more than 50 cents
on that.\\
329 - Well, 50 cents is two hamburgers,\\
330 - and that'll keep us eating for
another day.\\
331 - Isn't that a pitiful sight?\\
332 - Poor Fred.\\
333 - Oh, here, girl.\\
334 - What's this?\\
335 - That's your invitation to the party.\\
336 - I thought it was sort of silly to
mail it with the others.\\
337 - Oh, honey, you didn't have to invite
us.\\
338 - I insist that you come.\\
339 - I need your help.\\
340 - Our help?\\
341 - Ethel, we're having ten
five-year-olds.\\
342 - When they start wrestling and
fighting,\\
343 - I want you and Fred to help referee.\\
344 - Oh, but don't forget\\
345 - you'll have Superman here to keep
them in line.\\
346 - Well, that might help a little.\\
347 - Yeah.\\
348 - Gee, honey, that's a cute invitation.\\
349 - Aren't they sweet?\\
350 - Hello?\\
351 - Hi, honey.\\
352 - Oh, hi, we all set with Superman?\\
353 - Well, I'm afraid not, dear.\\
354 - You see, I talked to his secretary,\\
355 - and he's leaving Saturday for Terry
Hoot.\\
356 - For Terry who?\\
357 - Terry Hoot.
Terry hoot, Indiana.\\
358 - He's taking a plane Saturday.\\
359 - Oh, no.\\
360 - What's the matter, honey?\\
361 - Superman pooped out.\\
362 - Oh, honey, can't he take a later
plane?\\
363 - That's the only flight that day.\\
364 - Oh, if he's Superman, what does he
need a plane for?\\
365 - All right, all right.\\
366 - Oh, I've already told Little Ricky\\
367 - and all the other children.\\
368 - Well, honey, I'm sorry,\\
369 - but you shouldn't cross your bridges\\
370 - before they're hatched.\\
371 - What?\\
372 - You shouldn't burn your chickens
behind you.\\
373 - Oh, you know what I mean.\\
374 - You shouldn't tell people anything
until you're sure.\\
375 - Oh. Well, I was so certain you'd get
him.\\
376 - I tried, honey, but I can't, so don't
worry about it.\\
377 - Little Ricky will have a very nice
party anyway.\\
378 - Oh, I hope so.\\
379 - All right, dear, good-bye.\\
380 - Good-bye, dear.\\
381 - Oh, dear.\\
382 - Gee, that's a shame, Lucy.\\
383 - What are you going to do now?\\
384 - I don't know.\\
385 - If I can't produce Superman, my name
will be Supermud.\\
386 - Well, knowing you, I'm surprised\\
387 - you don't dress up like Superman\\
388 - and play the part yourself.\\
389 - Oh, Ethel, I could never get away\\
390 - with a silly thing like that.\\
391 - I'll say you couldn't.\\
392 - Although... maybe I could find some
ballet tights\\
393 - and make some sort of a cape,\\
394 - and then run around the room like
crazy\\
395 - and they wouldn't know the
difference.\\
396 - Are you serious?\\
397 - I don't want to disappoint those
kids.\\
398 - Now, look, here's what we'll do.\\
399 - Sometime during the party, you rush
over to the window,\\
400 - look up into the sky and announce my
arrival.\\
401 - You mean like this?\\
402 - Kids, guess who's here?\\
403 - It's Sup...\\
404 - The window?\\
405 - Oh, now, you're not gonna fly in
here?!\\
406 - Well, not exactly.\\
407 - Uh, during the party, I'll slip away\\
408 - and I'll go to the vacant apartment
next door.\\
409 - I'll go out the window and walk along
the ledge.\\
410 - The ledge? Honey, that's three
stories high!\\
411 - You might break your neck.\\
412 - Well, I'd rather break my neck\\
413 - than break my promise to Little
Ricky.\\
414 - Oh, gee, Lucy, I don't know.\\
415 - Isn't there some other way Superman
comes into a room?\\
416 - Well, sometimes he comes bursting
through a wall,\\
417 - but you know how Fred would feel
about that.\\
418 - Yep, you'd better fly in.\\
419 - Yeah.\\
420 - It's Terry's turn.\\
421 - Having fun?\\
422 - Oh, they're having a great
time, honey.\\
423 - Say, Lucy, Stevie's been asking me
when Superman's coming.\\
424 - When is he coming, dear?\\
425 - Oh, I have a feeling he'll be along
any minute.\\
426 - Okay, here we go.\\
427 - There you go.
There you go.\\
428 - He came pretty close.\\
429 - Lucy, I still say the helmet's wrong.\\
430 - Superman doesn't wear a helmet.\\
431 - He would if he wanted to cover his
long, red hair.\\
432 - I'm just afraid you won't be able\\
433 - to fool the kids, that's all.\\
434 - Well, let's hope they're so logy with
ice cream and cake,\\
435 - they won't know the difference.\\
436 - Yeah, let's hope so.\\
437 - Now, look, wait ten minutes, and then
give signal.\\
438 - Yeah, I will.\\
439 - You didn't tell Fred, did you?\\
440 - Oh, of course not.
Good.\\
441 - Hey, what'll I tell Ricky if he comes
home before you come in?\\
442 - Oh, just tell him anything.\\
443 - Anything?\\
444 - Anything but the truth.\\
445 - Oh. Good luck.
All right.\\
446 - Now, Lucy, be careful.\\
447 - I will.\\
448 - London bridge is falling down,
falling down, falling down\\
449 - London bridge is falling down, my
fair lady.\\
450 - Ha, ha, ha!\\
451 - Let's lock him up, lock him up, lock
him up...\\
452 - Yes?
How do you do?\\
453 - Oh, look, Martha, a party!\\
454 - Oh, is the landlord here?\\
455 - We saw the note on his door.\\
456 - We'd like to look at the apartment.\\
457 - that's for rent.\\
458 - Oh, well, he's busy just now.\\
459 - You'll have to come back tomorrow.\\
460 - Those folks want to see the
apartment?\\
461 - Yes, but I'll show it to them.\\
462 - You're having so much fun.\\
463 - Right over here.
Right over here.\\
464 - London bridge is falling down,
falling down, falling down...\\
465 - Shoosh, shoosh.\\
466 - Shoosh! Shoosh!\\
467 - Go deliver your messages.\\
468 - Uh, just a minute.\\
469 - Uh, here it is.\\
470 - Oh, nice.\\
471 - Well, now, uh, now then you just, uh,
look around\\
472 - and I'll be right next door.\\
473 - Well, we'd like to ask you a few
questions.\\
474 - Oh, you would?\\
475 - Yes. Would you redecorate if we
signed a lease?\\
476 - Well, uh, yes, I think we-we could do
that.\\
477 - Uh-huh, yes.\\
478 - Oh, all right, why don't you go to
Central Park?\\
479 - There's a million statues over there.\\
480 - Oh, come on, fellas.\\
481 - Everybody off.\\
482 - Ah, you big sissy.\\
483 - Oh, why don't you get off and walk?\\
484 - I wish I knew some pigeon English.\\
485 - My turn! My turn!\\
486 - Catch him.\\
487 - My turn! My turn!\\
488 - Go get him!
Hurry up.\\
489 - Hi, kids!\\
490 - Hi, Rick.\\
491 - Having a good time?\\
492 - Want to get into that game?\\
493 - Yeah, listen, where's Lucy?\\
494 - Isn't she in the kitchen?\\
495 - No, but guess who is.\\
496 - Who?
Superman!\\
497 - Superman!\\
498 - Well, you know, when he heard\\
499 - that it was a birthday party,\\
500 - he didn't want to disappoint the
kids.\\
501 - Isn't that great?
Yeah.\\
502 - You don't... Where, where'd she go?\\
503 - Ethel said she went out for some more
ice cream,\\
504 - and she hasn't come back yet.\\
505 - Oh, dear. I wanted her to be here,\\
506 - for the surprise, but I can't keep
him too long.\\
507 - I know it.\\
508 - Well, we'll have to do it.\\
509 - All right, children, I got a
wonderful surprise for you.\\
510 - Now if you all line up there\\
511 - and close your eyes.\\
512 - You're gonna get your wish, young
man.\\
513 - Just close your eyes.\\
514 - Right there, honey.\\
515 - Close your eyes.
Don't look now.\\
516 - Now when I tell you to look, you
look.\\
517 - You're gonna see your favorite
television star.\\
518 - Look-- Superman!\\
519 - How about that?\\
520 - And happy birthday, Little Ricky.\\
521 - Which one of you is Ricky?\\
522 - That's me.\\
523 - That's him right there.\\
524 - How are you, sweetie?\\
525 - Happy birthday.\\
526 - How about that, huh?\\
527 - Any of you fellows want to wrestle?\\
528 - Yeah! Yeah!\\
529 - We're not needed here.\\
530 - Come on, scoot, go home, go home, go
home.\\
531 - Heard any good stories lately?\\
532 - I'm sorry, but I really have to get
back to the party.\\
533 - Oh, we just love the apartment.\\
534 - But I'm not sure my wife ought to be
up so high.\\
535 - Yes, you see, I get dizzy spells.\\
536 - Oh.\\
537 - Well, you make up your mind, and then
you let me know.\\
538 - Shoosh, scoot, scat, scoot, scat.\\
539 - There's good light.\\
540 - There's plenty of closet space here.\\
541 - Martha, what is it?\\
542 - Out there.\\
543 - I just saw something strange.\\
544 - Something strange?\\
545 - Three flights up?\\
546 - Was it a bird?\\
547 - No.\\
548 - Was it a plane?\\
549 - No.\\
550 - Well, what was it, dear?\\
551 - It was Superman!\\
552 - There, there, Martha.\\
553 - Oh, come, come, come, Martha.\\
554 - Oh...\\
555 - We'll look for some basement
apartments.\\
556 - These heights make you dizzier than I
thought.\\
557 - Oh, it's raining in.\\
558 - I'll close the window for Mrs. Mertz.
Ooh!\\
559 - There. Now, come on,\\
560 - we'll go home so you can lie down,
honey.\\
561 - That's it.\\
562 - Shoosh.\\
563 - Oh!\\
564 - Bye-bye, Superman.\\
565 - Bye, kids\\
566 - Bye. Bye.\\
567 - We're glad you had a good time.\\
568 - Good-bye, Stevie.\\
569 - Bye, now.\\
570 - Glad you had a good time.\\
571 - Well, Superman,\\
572 - that was a wonderful thing you did.\\
573 - Oh, Ricky, it was my pleasure.\\
574 - I'm only sorry I didn't get to meet
Lucy.\\
575 - I've heard so much about her.\\
576 - Yeah, well, I don't know.
Where is Lucy, Ethel?\\
577 - Oh, she'll be here in a minute.\\
578 - She's out on the ledge.\\
579 - Oh.\\
580 - Out on the ledge?!\\
581 - Out here?
Yes...\\
582 - What's she doing out there?\\
583 - Lucy!\\
584 - Oh, my goodness.\\
585 - Lucy, are you all right?\\
586 - I'm caught!\\
587 - Wait... don't move, honey!\\
588 - I'll come and get you right away.
Wait a minute.\\
589 - Oh...\\
590 - No, Daddy, let Superman do it.\\
591 - All right.
Come on.\\
592 - Allow me?\\
593 - Yes, please.\\
594 - Oh, boy!\\
595 - Ah!\\
596 - How do you do?
My name is Superman.\\
597 - Oh, boy, am I glad to see you.\\
598 - Tell me, when you're flying around,\\
599 - do you have cape trouble?\\
600 - No, but then I've had a lot more
flying time than you have.\\
601 - Oh.\\
602 - Lucy, what are you doing out there?!\\
603 - Oh, I'm fixing the drainpipe.\\
604 - It was a little loose.\\
605 - Are you crazy? What are you doing in
that outfit?\\
606 - Well, uh...\\
607 - There you are.\\
608 - Come in here!
I want an explanation.\\
609 - Okay.\\
610 - Come on in here right now!\\
611 - Can you teach me to fly?
Uh...\\
612 - Lucy, of all the crazy things that
you've done\\
613 - in the 15 years that we've been
married...\\
614 - Ricardo, do you mean to say\\
615 - that you've been married to her for
15 years?\\
616 - Yeah, 15 years.\\
617 - And they call me Superman.
\subsection {Episode 14: Little Ricky Gets A Dog (1957)}
1 - Good morning.\\
2 - Hi, honey.
Oh, hi.\\
3 - Say, I'm going to the market pretty
soon.\\
4 - You want to go with me?\\
5 - I can't, I have to take care of\\
6 - Little Ricky's little friends.\\
7 - Lucy, it looks like you're running a
pet shop.\\
8 - Oh, you're telling me.\\
9 - Every morning I have to change the
paper\\
10 - in Alice and Phil's cage,\\
11 - I have to feed Tommy and Jimmy their
turtle food,\\
12 - and I have to water their little palm
tree,\\
13 - I have to tidy up the cigar box for
Hopalong...\\
14 - Hopalong?\\
15 - He's the frog.
Oh.\\
16 - And I have to change the water for
Mildred and Charles.\\
17 - I wonder if this is the way Osa
Johnson started.\\
18 - Come on, Mildred, come, dear.\\
19 - Come, Mildred.\\
20 - Sweetheart, there we are.\\
21 - Hey, girl, you're pretty good at
that.\\
22 - Well, Mildred's easy, Charles is the
problem.\\
23 - Oh, Charles, come, dear.\\
24 - Charles.
Charles?\\
25 - Chuckie-Wuckie.\\
26 - Charles.\\
27 - Charles!\\
28 - I see what you mean.\\
29 - I have several different techniques I
work with him.\\
30 - Sometimes I sneak up on him.\\
31 - And then again, I just act
nonchalant,\\
32 - you know, sort of stroll away, and,
uh...\\
33 - And then when I think\\
34 - he's off his guard, I just...\\
35 - Listen, let me borrow your hairnet.\\
36 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
37 - Aw, come on, I'll buy you a new one.\\
38 - I didn't think of this before.\\
39 - Oh, help me, will you?\\
40 - Okay, I'll help you.
Over here.\\
41 - Grab the bottom.
Okay. Got it? You got it?\\
42 - Yeah. I'll hold on to the net.\\
43 - Now, you just tip up as far as you
can.\\
44 - Okay, go, fast.\\
45 - All right, go!
Real fast.\\
46 - I got it, I got it, I got it.\\
47 - There.\\
48 - There, now that was simple, wasn't
it?\\
49 - Simple?\\
50 - Gregory Peck had less trouble with
Moby Dick.\\
51 - Well, that's life.\\
52 - Children bring home pets, mothers
take care of them.\\
53 - Oh, now, who's the lettuce for?\\
54 - Lunch for hopalong.\\
55 - Okay?\\
56 - Okay.\\
57 - Lucy, why do you let Little Ricky\\
58 - keep all these pets?\\
59 - Well, I think it's important for a
child to have pets,\\
60 - especially a city child, you know.\\
61 - Gee, sometimes, I think we should
move to the country\\
62 - so Little Ricky could have all the
animals he wants.\\
63 - Oh, Lucy, don't even say you might
move away.\\
64 - I don't know what I'd do without you.\\
65 - Well, frankly, Ethel,\\
66 - I don't know what I'd do without you,
either.\\
67 - Besides, with another vacant
apartment,\\
68 - Frantic Freddy would blow what's left
of his top.\\
69 - I just went through three weeks of
torture\\
70 - with that apartment next door.\\
71 - Hey, speaking of our new neighbors,\\
72 - are there any little children Ricky's
age?\\
73 - No, it's a bachelor, a Mr. Stewart.\\
74 - And he's an old grouch.\\
75 - Why would Fred rent to an old grouch?\\
76 - Well, to one old grouch,\\
77 - another old grouch doesn't seem like
an old grouch.\\
78 - And he's gonna pay to have his
kitchen remodeled,\\
79 - so Fred doesn't care anything\\
80 - about his disposition.
Oh.\\
81 - Well, I'm going on to the market,
honey.\\
82 - You want anything?\\
83 - Well, not for us,\\
84 - but, uh, Alice and Phil could use
some birdseed\\
85 - and Tommy and Jimmy could use some
turtle food\\
86 - and Mildred and Charles could use
some fish food.\\
87 - Wouldn't it be easier if they just
ate each other?\\
88 - I'll see you later.
Okay.\\
89 - Hi, Mommy.\\
90 - Well, hello...\\
91 - Oh, for goodness sake.\\
92 - What have you got there?\\
93 - A doggie.\\
94 - Whose is it?\\
95 - Mine.\\
96 - Yours?\\
97 - Uh-huh.\\
98 - Is that one of Billy Palmer's six
puppies?\\
99 - Oh, now, honey, listen, I'm sorry,\\
100 - it's a very sweet little puppy,\\
101 - but I'm afraid we're not gonna be
able to can't keep it.\\
102 - Why not?\\
103 - Well, for one thing dear,\\
104 - our house is too small for a dog.\\
105 - But, Mommy, it's a small dog.\\
106 - Well, I know, but he's gonna grow
bigger.\\
107 - Maybe our house will grow bigger,
too.\\
108 - Look, honey, I got all I can do to
take care of your fish\\
109 - and your parakeets and your frog and
your turtles...\\
110 - But, Mommy!\\
111 - Aw, now, honey, I'm sorry, I'm just
gonna have to call\\
112 - Billy's Mommy and...
and tell her that...\\
113 - that we can't keep the puppy.\\
114 - Oh!
I'm sorry, sweetheart.\\
115 - You take your things off now.\\
116 - Lillian?\\
117 - Lillian, this is Lucy.\\
118 - Yes, about the little puppy.\\
119 - About the little pu...\\
120 - Well, I, I...\\
121 - I, I just wanted to say...\\
122 - I just wanted to say thank you for
this sweet little puppy.\\
123 - Yes, well, thank you very much.\\
124 - Good-bye.\\
125 - Oh, boy, thanks, Mommy!\\
126 - Well, honey, I can't make any
promises,\\
127 - but we'll just have to wait until
Daddy comes home\\
128 - see what he thinks, huh?\\
129 - Okay, you go to your room now,
sweetheart.\\
130 - Okay, Mommy.\\
131 - Aw.\\
132 - Oh, hi, dear.\\
133 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
134 - Where's Little Ricky?\\
135 - He's in his room.\\
136 - Ah, Good. I'll go say hello to him.\\
137 - Oh, honey, before you do, come here.\\
138 - We, uh...\\
139 - We have a bit of a problem.\\
140 - Well, what is it?\\
141 - He brought home a little puppy dog
today.\\
142 - Honey, you know that he can't keep a
dog\\
143 - in this apartment.
There's no room.\\
144 - I know that, dear.\\
145 - He already has frogs and turtles\\
146 - and parakeets and goldfish and
lizard...\\
147 - The lizard fell out the window,
remember?\\
148 - He didn't fall out of the window--\\
149 - he jumped out to get away from the
crowd.\\
150 - Now, look, honey, he cannot keep a
dog in this apartment.\\
151 - I know, I know.\\
152 - Well, did you tell him?\\
153 - Were you firm about it?\\
154 - Well, not exactly.\\
155 - Well, what did you tell him?\\
156 - Well, I told him he'd have to wait\\
157 - till Daddy got home and let him
decide\\
158 - whether we could keep the dog or not.\\
159 - Oh, that's being firm.\\
160 - Well... can I help it if I'm soft and
squishy?\\
161 - Oh, he's the cutest little puppy.\\
162 - Wait till you see them together,
honey.\\
163 - Look, dear, it's out of the question.\\
164 - The boy cannot keep a dog in this
apartment.\\
165 - Now, the trouble with you is that\\
166 - you don't use enough discipline with
the child.\\
167 - I'll just go in there and tell him,
"Little Ricky,\\
168 - you cannot keep a dog in this
apartment."\\
169 - And that's that.\\
170 - Huh, gee!\\
171 - Hi, Daddy.\\
172 - Hi, son.\\
173 - Oh, is that your little dog?\\
174 - He's very cute.\\
175 - Hi, there, boy.\\
176 - He likes you, Daddy.\\
177 - Yes, yes, very cute.\\
178 - Look, uh, partner,\\
179 - I... have to have\\
180 - a little talk with you.\\
181 - Now, I know that\\
182 - you're old enough to know\\
183 - that you cannot have everything that
you want.\\
184 - Now, it just so happens that...\\
185 - Well, did you talk to him, dear?\\
186 - Yeah.\\
187 - Where you going?\\
188 - Down to the basement to get a box.\\
189 - A box?\\
190 - Well, that little puppy can't sleep\\
191 - on the cold floor all night.\\
192 - Oh, hi.\\
193 - Hi.
Hi, Rick.\\
194 - Hi, Fred.
Hi.\\
195 - Say, Fred, have you got a box down in
the basement?\\
196 - Yeah. What for?\\
197 - For Little Ricky's dog.\\
198 - Oh, th-th-the dog.\\
199 - Yeah.
Yeah, uh, uh...\\
200 - That's what I want to talk to you
about.\\
201 - Ethel just told me about it.\\
202 - Yeah.
You can't have a dog in this
apartment.\\
203 - Oh, it's only a tiny little bitty
dog.\\
204 - Yeah, Fred, we're not gonna let him
grow very big.\\
205 - But there's a "no pet" clause in your
lease.\\
206 - Oh, now, Fred.\\
207 - Now, haven't I been lenient?\\
208 - Didn't I close my eyes when you got
the turtles?\\
209 - Didn't I look the other way when,
uh...\\
210 - the frogs and the goldfish arrived?\\
211 - Didn't I keep quiet\\
212 - when you got those two, uh, molting
buzzards?\\
213 - I've got to draw the line someplace.\\
214 - That pooch has got to go.\\
215 - Oh, Fred, you haven't seen him.\\
216 - He is the cutest little thing!\\
217 - One more word out of you, Ethel, and
you go, too.\\
218 - Ah, I'm afraid that Fred's right.\\
219 - Oh, now, honey.
Well, I'm sorry.\\
220 - I'm sorry, but if I let Little Ricky
have a dog,\\
221 - everybody in the building will want
one!\\
222 - I don't mind being a landlord,\\
223 - but I'll be darned if I'm gonna run a
pet motel!\\
224 - All right, Fred, all right, we
understand.\\
225 - Mommy, Daddy.\\
226 - What is it, dear?\\
227 - I found a name for my dog.\\
228 - Oh, what?\\
229 - His name is Fred.\\
230 - Fred?\\
231 - Well, how did you ever happen to name
him that?\\
232 - I always name my pets after people I
like.\\
233 - Fred, where you going?\\
234 - Down in the basement to get the box.\\
235 - Come on, Rick.\\
236 - Oh, wonderful!\\
237 - Oh, boy!\\
238 - Aw, now, you saved the day,
sweetheart.\\
239 - Hey, you know you kind of look like
Fred?\\
240 - Except you got a lot more hair than
he has.\\
241 - Oh...\\
242 - Oh, no, not again.\\
243 - What time is it?\\
244 - Huh?
What time is it?\\
245 - 3:00.\\
246 - Oh.\\
247 - He's getting better; he hasn't yipped
in about 20 minutes.\\
248 - Can you go out in the kitchen\\
249 - and see if you can quiet him down
again?\\
250 - Oh, now, you go; it's your turn.\\
251 - I'm sitting this one out.
You go.\\
252 - No, Ricky, you go.\\
253 - You go-- it's your son's dog.\\
254 - My son? Isn't he your son, too?\\
255 - Not at 3:00 in the morning, he isn't.\\
256 - Now, who's that?\\
257 - How do I know?\\
258 - Hello?\\
259 - Lucy?\\
260 - Yeah?\\
261 - Fred.\\
262 - Fred, what are you doing\\
263 - up at this hour?\\
264 - What do you mean, what am I doing up
at this hour?\\
265 - The whole building's awake.\\
266 - I've had six phone calls\\
267 - complaining about that hound of
yours.\\
268 - All right, Fred, I'll see what I can
do.\\
269 - Well, see what you can do!\\
270 - All right.\\
271 - All right, Fred.
All right, Fred.\\
272 - All right, Fred.\\
273 - Okay, okay, okay.\\
274 - Listen, what am I gonna do with you?\\
275 - Oh, dear.\\
276 - Fred,\\
277 - I told you to go to sleep.\\
278 - Do you understand?
Sleep, sleep, sleep.\\
279 - Look at me.\\
280 - Oh...\\
281 - I'll sing you to sleep.\\
282 - Now, come on, Fred,\\
283 - please, please, please, go to sleep.\\
284 - Please, Fred.\\
285 - Rockabye doggy on the treetop\\
286 - When the wind blows...\\
287 - All right, so I'm not Dinah Shore.\\
288 - You're no Lassie, either.\\
289 - Now, Fred, please, get in there and
go to sleep.\\
290 - Don't you know what time it is?!\\
291 - It's 3:00 in the morning.\\
292 - Do you hear me?\\
293 - 3:00!\\
294 - Hey.\\
295 - Maybe that will work.\\
296 - Now, you get down there, see?\\
297 - Now, look, look, now, nice clock,
nice clock.\\
298 - That's a good boy.\\
299 - Look at that. Look at that.\\
300 - Yeah. Yeah, see?\\
301 - That's a nice boy.\\
302 - That's a nice Fred.\\
303 - Yeah.\\
304 - Hey, he stopped.\\
305 - How'd you do it?\\
306 - Well, I remember reading someplace\\
307 - if you put a clock in with a little
puppy,\\
308 - they go to sleep.\\
309 - The ticking sound keeps them company\\
310 - or something, I don't know.\\
311 - Oh, nice work.\\
312 - We can only hope.
Good night.\\
313 - Good night.\\
314 - What are you doing?\\
315 - You put an alarm clock in there!\\
316 - I didn't know it was gonna go off.\\
317 - What's the matter with you?\\
318 - We're coming!\\
319 - We're coming!\\
320 - Who's that?
Who's that?\\
321 - How do I know?\\
322 - Wait a minute!
What are you...\\
323 - That dog's got to go and right this
minute!\\
324 - All right now, take it easy, Fred,
take it easy.\\
325 - What do you mean, take it easy?\\
326 - Mr. Stewart, the new tenant,\\
327 - just phoned and threatens to move!\\
328 - All right.
Lucy, I'm sorry,\\
329 - but it's either the tenants or the
dog.\\
330 - And dogs don't pay rent.\\
331 - All right, Fred, all right.\\
332 - We'll get rid of him tomorrow
morning.\\
333 - Well, see that you do.\\
334 - Okay.
Come on, Fred.\\
335 - You're awful cranky.\\
336 - Yeah, go back to bed, will you, Fred?\\
337 - Now, look, honey, I'm sorry,\\
338 - but you will have to tell Little
Ricky\\
339 - that he has to get rid of the dog.\\
340 - I'll make a deal with you:\\
341 - You tell Little Ricky, I'll tell the
dog.\\
342 - Look, honey, let's be sensible.\\
343 - Tomorrow morning, when Little Ricky
gets up,\\
344 - one of us will tell him.\\
345 - Which one?\\
346 - Well...\\
347 - whoever sees him first.\\
348 - Okay.\\
349 - Good morning, Fred.\\
350 - All right, Ricky Ricardo,\\
351 - will you please tell me where you
were going?\\
352 - Me?\\
353 - Uh, rehearsal.\\
354 - Yeah, that's it, rehearsal at the
club.\\
355 - At 7:00 in the morning?\\
356 - Well, yeah, well...\\
357 - Uh, never mind about me.\\
358 - Where were you going?\\
359 - To the market.\\
360 - The market is open at 7:00 in the
morning?\\
361 - If you can have a rehearsal, the
market can be open!\\
362 - I know what you were trying to do.\\
363 - You were trying to sneak out of the
apartment\\
364 - so you didn't have to tell Little
Ricky.\\
365 - Yeah, well, you gotta get up awful
early\\
366 - in the morning to sneak out of this
apartment.\\
367 - You can say that again.\\
368 - Yeah... you're right, honey.\\
369 - I'm his father.\\
370 - I guess I should tell him.\\
371 - Oh, well, honey, I'm glad you finally
decided.\\
372 - Hi, Mommy.
Hi, Daddy.\\
373 - Well, good morning, sweetheart.
Hi, son.\\
374 - Say, uh, I want to talk to you,
partner...\\
375 - because you...\\
376 - He went to get his dog.\\
377 - Oh.\\
378 - Yes, Daddy?\\
379 - All right, we have to have a talk
here.\\
380 - I want to tell you that, uh...\\
381 - I want to tell you that, uh...\\
382 - I want to tell you\\
383 - that your mother has\\
384 - something to tell you.\\
385 - I am late. I gotta go.\\
386 - Good-bye, everybody.\\
387 - Well, honey, listen.\\
388 - Listen, sweetheart.\\
389 - Oh, it's not important, it can wait.\\
390 - What say you, Fred and I have some
breakfast?\\
391 - Okay.		Okay, Mommy.\\
392 - Come on, sweetheart.\\
393 - You are the cutest thing.\\
394 - Aw, come on, he just loves this hat.\\
395 - Hee-hee.\\
396 - Who is it?\\
397 - It's me, Fred.\\
398 - Well, what is it, Fred?\\
399 - Well, Mr. Stewart here claims that he
heard a dog barking.\\
400 - You did get rid of that dog, didn't
you, Lucy?\\
401 - Well, you told me to, didn't you,
Fred?\\
402 - Well, that's what I told Mr. Stewart,\\
403 - but he insists on having a look for
himself.\\
404 - Oh. Oh, well, just a minute, Fred.\\
405 - Honey, it's way past your nap time.\\
406 - You run in and take your nap,
sweetheart.\\
407 - Okay, Mommy.\\
408 - Thank you, sweetheart.\\
409 - Go on.\\
410 - What's keeping you, Lucy?\\
411 - Okay. Okay, Fred, just a minute.\\
412 - Oh, hello, Fred.\\
413 - Oh, oh, hello.
This is Mr. Stewart,\\
414 - your new neighbor.\\
415 - This is Mrs. Ricardo.\\
416 - How do you do, sir?\\
417 - Do you have a dog in here?\\
418 - A dog in here?\\
419 - I told you they got rid of it.\\
420 - Then what was that barking a few
minutes ago?\\
421 - Oh, you must have been hearing
things... sir.\\
422 - Now, just remember, Mertz.\\
423 - If I find there is a dog in this
building,\\
424 - I'm taking back the first and last
month's rent\\
425 - and moving out.\\
426 - I can assure you, there's no dog
around here.\\
427 - Right, Lucy?\\
428 - Oh, you won't find a dog around here.\\
429 - Oh, no?\\
430 - Well, if there's no dog in this
apartment,\\
431 - what are these doing here?\\
432 - Oh, they're mine.\\
433 - I love a snack in the afternoon.\\
434 - You eat dog biscuits?\\
435 - Oh, yes.\\
436 - Yes, yes. Th-they're wonderful.\\
437 - I just love them.\\
438 - Um, um, um, I...
Would you...\\
439 - Oh, you should try it!\\
440 - There's, um... They're...\\
441 - They got it all over doughnuts for
dunking.\\
442 - Want one?\\
443 - Fred?\\
444 - No, no, thanks.
I'm trying to cut down.\\
445 - Hi, honey.\\
446 - Oh, hi, Rick.
Oh, hi!\\
447 - This is Mr. Stewart,\\
448 - your new neighbor.\\
449 - This is Mr. Ricardo.\\
450 - Oh. How do you do?\\
451 - I'm sorry about all that noise last
night.\\
452 - It won't happen again.\\
453 - I should hope not.\\
454 - Oh, we, we got rid of the dog this
morning, didn't we, Lucy?\\
455 - Well, you don't see him around, do
you?\\
456 - Well, good.\\
457 - Uh, excuse me.\\
458 - Uh, oh, I'll, I'll hang that up for
you, dear.\\
459 - I can do it, honey.
No, no, no, I'll do it.\\
460 - That's what wives are for.\\
461 - Oh, so that's what they're for.\\
462 - Say, uh, Mr. Stewart,\\
463 - what kind of business are you in?\\
464 - I'm retired.\\
465 - Oh, well, nice work if you can get
it.\\
466 - Mr. Ricardo's in the nightclub
business.\\
467 - He owns the Club Babalu.\\
468 - You've probably heard of it.\\
469 - I never go to nightclubs.\\
470 - Oh, oh.\\
471 - Mr. Stewart wants to remodel his
kitchen, Ricky.\\
472 - Do you mind if he has a look at
yours?\\
473 - Well, we have a very
modest....\\
474 - Yeah, go ahead, honey, show him the
kitchen.\\
475 - Go ahead, dear.\\
476 - The kitchen's right in here, Mr.
Stewart.\\
477 - Oh, thanks.\\
478 - Right in here?\\
479 - What's that doing on the floor?\\
480 - Oh, I, uh...\\
481 - I-I was gonna practice my hat
dancing.\\
482 - What hat dancing?\\
483 - Oh, I was gonna try to surprise you,
dear.\\
484 - I've been taking hat dancing lessons
from Arthur Murray.\\
485 - Yeah?\\
486 - Yeah!\\
487 - Ole!\\
488 - The kitchen's right in here.\\
489 - Hey!\\
490 - Hey!\\
491 - Well, I guess I'd better get
back to my own apartment.\\
492 - Well, I told you it wasn't much of a
kitchen, you know.\\
493 - I must remind you, you'll have
to stand the expense.\\
494 - I know, I know.\\
495 - You told me 20 times.\\
496 - Just so you understand.\\
497 - I understand.\\
498 - I have a very\\
499 - nice carpenter.\\
500 - What was that?\\
501 - It's me, I'm playing the piano.\\
502 - Since when do you play the piano?\\
503 - I thought I'd play the piano, uh,\\
504 - so that I can accompany myself with
my hat dancing.\\
505 - Well, that was very strange-sounding
music.\\
506 - Well, it's, uh, progressive jazz.\\
507 - I'm taking singing lessons!\\
508 - Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, where's my dog?!\\
509 - For goodness sake, come here.\\
510 - Here's your dog, son.\\
511 - That does it, Mertz.
I'm moving.\\
512 - I must remind you, Stewart, you have
a lease.\\
513 - The lease says, "No pets."\\
514 - Now, either the dog goes, or I go.\\
515 - Good. I'd rather live with a little
dog\\
516 - than a big grouch!\\
517 - Here, take your check back and scram!\\
518 - With pleasure!\\
519 - Adios!\\
520 - Oh, hello, Mr. Stewart...\\
521 - I guess I told him off.\\
522 - Hey, what's the matter with Mr.
Stewart?\\
523 - Oh, Fred just did a wonderful thing.\\
524 - He sure did, he told Mr. Stewart\\
525 - he could take his check back\\
526 - and told him to scram.
Yeah.\\
527 - Darn right I did.\\
528 - It's not the money, it's the
principle of the thing.\\
529 - Fred, you gave him back the whole
$250?\\
530 - Yes, I gave him back the whole 200...\\
531 - $250?!\\
532 - Get the fan, honey, and fan him.\\
533 - Oh, Fred...\\
534 - Do something, fan him.
Fred?\\
535 - the hearty coffee you can drink as
strong as you like,\\
536 - it still can't upset your nerves.
\subsection {Episode 15: Lucy Wants To Move To The Country (1957)}
1 - Ethel!\\
2 - Hi, honey.\\
3 - Hi.\\
4 - Did you have a nice weekend in
Connecticut?\\
5 - Oh, honey, it was just marvelous.\\
6 - The Munsons' place is so beautiful\\
7 - and Grace Munson is so sweet.\\
8 - Look what she gave me to bring home.\\
9 - Country butter.\\
10 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
11 - Grace made that herself, and look...\\
12 - Grape jelly.\\
13 - From the grapes in their own arbors.\\
14 - Grace made that, too.\\
15 - And look at the size of these eggs.\\
16 - Now, don't tell me that Grace...\\
17 - Oh...\\
18 - Ha! Don't be silly.\\
19 - But they're from their own chickens.\\
20 - Oh.
And these are for you.\\
21 - Oh, thanks, honey.\\
22 - Oh, Ethel, there's nothing like
living in the country.\\
23 - Clean, fresh air, homegrown food.\\
24 - Lucy, you're not thinking of moving,
are you?\\
25 - Why not? It'd be great for Little
Ricky.\\
26 - And Grace took us to see\\
27 - the most wonderful house that's for
sale--\\
28 - a quaint, old, early American.\\
29 - Why, Lucy, you're really serious
about this.\\
30 - Well, I am, but Ricky isn't.\\
31 - We argued about it all the way home
on the train.\\
32 - You know how pigheaded he can be.\\
33 - Well, hurray for pigheaded Ricky.\\
34 - Ethel, whose side are you on?\\
35 - Well, I know it'd be wonderful for
Little Ricky,\\
36 - but I'm thinking of big Ethel.\\
37 - Gee, if you moved to the country,\\
38 - I may never see you again.\\
39 - Oh, now, it's not as bad as all that.\\
40 - You and Fred can come out on the
train on weekends.\\
41 - A round-trip ticket's only $3.08.\\
42 - Hi, Ethel.
Hi, Rick.\\
43 - Hi, dear.
Honey, I'm in a hurry.\\
44 - I haven't got time for breakfast.\\
45 - Oh, honey, I wanted to fix you\\
46 - a couple those nice, fresh country
eggs.\\
47 - I'm sorry, honey, but I got to go.\\
48 - Oh, and I wanted to give you some
toast\\
49 - spread with country butter and
homemade jelly.\\
50 - Lucy, don't start that again.\\
51 - Start what again?\\
52 - We decided on the train last night\\
53 - that we're not gonna talk about
moving to the country anymore.\\
54 - We didn't, you did.\\
55 - I decided to keep right on talking
about it.\\
56 - All right, you keep on talking\\
57 - and I'll keep right on not listening.\\
58 - Oh, honey, won't you at least think
about it\\
59 - before you say no?\\
60 - All right.\\
61 - No.\\
62 - Oh, you.\\
63 - Good-bye.\\
64 - Good-bye.
Bye, Ethel.\\
65 - Bye, Rick.\\
66 - Oh, boy, good for him.\\
67 - I have a feeling this is one time\\
68 - you're not going to be able to talk
Ricky into something.\\
69 - Don't you be too sure.\\
70 - All my life I've wanted to live\\
71 - in a quaint, old, early American
house,\\
72 - and I'm not giving up without a
fight.\\
73 - Oh, speaking of quaint old early
Americans,\\
74 - I have to fix Fred's breakfast.\\
75 - See you later.
Okay.\\
76 - Thanks for the eggs, honey.\\
77 - Okay.\\
78 - Hi, honey.\\
79 - Hi.\\
80 - What are you doing?\\
81 - Moving the furniture.\\
82 - Well, obviously, but why is it all
pushed together\\
83 - in the middle of the room?\\
84 - So I can show Ricky how cramped it is\\
85 - living in a crowded city apartment.\\
86 - And then he'll want to move to the
country, is that it?\\
87 - Ethel, I wish you'd stop thinking
like my friend\\
88 - and start thinking like Little
Ricky's godmother.\\
89 - Well, I just don't want you to move
away, that's all.\\
90 - Oh...\\
91 - Gee.\\
92 - Look out.\\
93 - Morbid curiosity makes me ask:\\
94 - What is that for?\\
95 - That's to show Ricky how really dirty
it is in the city.\\
96 - I should have known.\\
97 - Yeah.\\
98 - Don't tell me.\\
99 - City pallor.\\
100 - That's right.\\
101 - Oh.\\
102 - Let's see now.\\
103 - There, I'm all ready for Ricky to
come home.\\
104 - When is the poor unsuspecting victim
due?\\
105 - Any minute now.\\
106 - Well, bad luck.\\
107 - Oh, Ethel, honestly.\\
108 - Hi, honey.\\
109 - Oh, hi, dear.\\
110 - What's the matter with you?\\
111 - Nothing. Why?\\
112 - You look kind of pale.\\
113 - Oh, that.\\
114 - Well, we don't get much sun around
here, you know?\\
115 - It was sunny today when you were out.\\
116 - Yeah, I was out, but you know how it
is here in New York,\\
117 - with all the big skyscrapers.\\
118 - The Empire State Building has better
color than I do.\\
119 - Lucy, what are you driving at?\\
120 - Nothing, darling.\\
121 - Here, I'll hang this up for you.\\
122 - Oh, honestly!\\
123 - This apartment gets smaller every
day.\\
124 - What's the matter with the furniture?\\
125 - Not a thing. Why?\\
126 - Why is it all scrunched up together\\
127 - in the middle like that?\\
128 - Well, that's what happens\\
129 - after you spend a weekend in the
country.\\
130 - You realize how small these city
apartments really are.\\
131 - Any mail today?\\
132 - It's on the mantle, dear.\\
133 - Thank you.\\
134 - Oh, honestly, the dirt in this city!\\
135 - Now, you wouldn't believe that I
dusted there\\
136 - just a half an hour ago, would you?\\
137 - Oh, living in this congested city,\\
138 - you just have one cold after another.\\
139 - Lucy, I think you have gone far
enough.\\
140 - How's that?\\
141 - I said you have gone far enough.\\
142 - Oh, you're gonna have to speak up,
dear.\\
143 - I can't hear a thing over that city
noise.\\
144 - Why don't you sit down, dear,\\
145 - if you can find room in this crowded
apartment.\\
146 - I'm gonna put our poor little city
child to bed\\
147 - in his stuffy, dusty little room.\\
148 - While you're in there, wash that pale
look off your face.\\
149 - Hi, Rick.\\
150 - Hi.
Hi.\\
151 - Go ahead.\\
152 - Uh, Rick, we've been talking it over\\
153 - and we think you should move to the
country.\\
154 - You do?\\
155 - Yup. After all, it doesn't matter\\
156 - if we have a vacant apartment,\\
157 - and what's money compared\\
158 - to the health and well-being of our
good friends?\\
159 - Fred, you really mean that?\\
160 - No, but Ethel made me say it.\\
161 - He does, too, mean it.\\
162 - I really do, Rick.\\
163 - For once you should listen to the
rattle-brained redhead.\\
164 - I get it. You're part of Lucy's
propaganda campaign.\\
165 - No, we're not.\\
166 - I was against it at first and said
so,\\
167 - but after I got to thinking it over,\\
168 - I realized I was just being selfish.\\
169 - Little Ricky should live in the
country.\\
170 - You really think so, huh?\\
171 - Yes, I think that every child is
better off\\
172 - when they're out in the fresh air.\\
173 - Can you keep a secret?\\
174 - Ethel, put your fingers in your ears.\\
175 - Why?\\
176 - Because the only way you can keep a
secret\\
177 - is not to hear it.\\
178 - Oh, never mind now.
I won't tell, Ricky.\\
179 - Well, you know, next week is our 16th
wedding anniversary.\\
180 - Yeah, I know that.\\
181 - And I got a surprise for Lucy.\\
182 - Oh, what is it?\\
183 - I bought her that house in the
country.\\
184 - You bought the house?\\
185 - Yeah. Isn't that wonderful?\\
186 - You know, I pretended to be against
it at first\\
187 - to throw her off the track.\\
188 - But it's a wonderful house and I got
a real bargain.\\
189 - I gave the man $500 deposit this
afternoon.\\
190 - Gee, that's swell.\\
191 - What's the matter, Ethel?\\
192 - I thought you said we should move.\\
193 - Yes, I... I know we said you should
move, but...\\
194 - But what?\\
195 - You're going to move.\\
196 - Good grief, Ethel.\\
197 - Oh, now, it won't be that bad.\\
198 - Sure, we can go out and see them on
weekends.\\
199 - Fred, round-trip tickets on the train
cost $3.08 apiece.\\
200 - Like I said, they can come in and see
us on weekends.\\
201 - Good night, sweetheart.\\
202 - Shh...\\
203 - Well, hi, Fred.
Hi.\\
204 - Hi, Ethel.\\
205 - Hi.\\
206 - Honey, the baby wants you to come in\\
207 - and tell him a bedtime story.\\
208 - All right, dear.\\
209 - Why don't you tell him\\
210 - the one about Rudolph the red-nosed
reindeer\\
211 - who lived in the big city and had one
cold after another\\
212 - and had to keep blowing his nose and
that's why his nose was red.\\
213 - I'll do that.\\
214 - Or you could tell him the one\\
215 - about Snow White and the seven city
dwarfs--\\
216 - Sneezy, Dusty, Stuffy, Drafty,
Sniffly,\\
217 - Noisy...\\
218 - That's enough.\\
219 - ..and Pasty.\\
220 - Gee, I'm sure not getting anywhere
with him.\\
221 - You don't suppose through the
years, Ricky has grown\\
222 - an immunity to me, do you?\\
223 - Well, they're giving shots for
everything these days.\\
224 - Well, I don't know.\\
225 - Looks like the Ricardos and the
Mertzes\\
226 - are gonna be living side by side for
the rest of their lives.\\
227 - What's the matter with you, Ethel?\\
228 - Are you crying?\\
229 - No. No, I... I just guess\\
230 - I'm getting one of those city colds
you were talking about.\\
231 - You are, too, crying.\\
232 - I am not!\\
233 - Oh, Ethel.\\
234 - Come on, Ethel, we'd better get out
of here.\\
235 - No, now, wait a minute, Fred.\\
236 - Something's wrong.
What is it, Ethel?\\
237 - Oh, Lucy, I know you're not gonna
move,\\
238 - but if you ever do move, don't move!\\
239 - Oh, Lucy...\\
240 - Why, I've never seen her like this
before.\\
241 - Oh, she's out of control.\\
242 - Oh, well...\\
243 - Come on, honey, but you'd better go
home\\
244 - and lie down and take a nap\\
245 - and I'll put a cold cloth on your
head.\\
246 - No, no, no.\\
247 - Oh, honey, now, there's no need to
get upset,\\
248 - We're not moving to the country.\\
249 - You heard what Ricky said.\\
250 - Oh...\\
251 - Well, honey, I know how you feel.\\
252 - I'd hate to leave you, too.\\
253 - I must have been crazy to even think
about moving.\\
254 - Yes, Lucy.\\
255 - Oh, for corn's sake.\\
256 - I wouldn't leave you two and go to
the country\\
257 - if you paid me.\\
258 - You wouldn't?\\
259 - Really, I wouldn't.\\
260 - Oh...\\
261 - Well, he fell asleep right after I
was...\\
262 - What happened?\\
263 - Oh, honey,\\
264 - thank you for being so stubborn and
pigheaded.\\
265 - What?\\
266 - I'm glad you didn't buy that house.\\
267 - I don't want to move.\\
268 - You dun't?\\
269 - No, I "dun't."\\
270 - I want to stay right here\\
271 - in the city near my loved ones.\\
272 - Well, one of your loved ones isn't
gonna be very near.\\
273 - Which one?\\
274 - Me-- I'm gonna be living in the
country.\\
275 - What?\\
276 - Well, I wanted to save it\\
277 - as a surprise for our anniversary,
but...\\
278 - Well, I bought you that house.\\
279 - Yes.\\
280 - You bought me that house?\\
281 - Oh, Ricky, that's the sweetest,
nicest thing you've ever done\\
282 - in all the years we've been married.\\
283 - I thought so.\\
284 - Oh, wasn't that sweet?\\
285 - Sweet, sweet.\\
286 - Oh...\\
287 - What's the matter with them?\\
288 - Five minutes ago, she wanted the
house.\\
289 - Oh, that was before Ethel turned on
the waterworks.\\
290 - Well, if I'd known that the Bobbsey
twins\\
291 - were gonna pledge eternal friendship,\\
292 - I wouldn't have given that guy $500
deposit this afternoon.\\
293 - Well, honey, you can get your deposit
back.\\
294 - How?\\
295 - Well, can't you just tell him\\
296 - that you changed your mind?
Yes.\\
297 - Well, honey, buying a house is not
like buying a dress.\\
298 - You just can't call up the guy\\
299 - and say "I don't like the color."\\
300 - Well, you could tell him\\
301 - it doesn't fit.
Yes.\\
302 - All right, all right, I'll call him
first thing in the morning\\
303 - and see what I can do.\\
304 - Oh, thank you, honey.
Oh, Ricky!\\
305 - Are you sure you won't change your
mind again?\\
306 - I'm positive, honey.\\
307 - I never want to live any other place
as long as I live.\\
308 - All right.\\
309 - I just want to be right here.\\
310 - Okay. Okay.\\
311 - Women-- you can't live with them,\\
312 - but I guess it'd be pretty hard to
live without them.\\
313 - Well, it might be worth a try.\\
314 - Well, I know, I know, Mr. Spaulding,\\
315 - but you see, well, my wife changed
her mind\\
316 - and I thought that maybe we could...\\
317 - Sure.\\
318 - Yes, sir, uh-huh.\\
319 - All right, sir. Good-bye.\\
320 - What did he say?\\
321 - Is he gonna give you your deposit
back?\\
322 - He said absolutely not.\\
323 - A deal is a deal.\\
324 - Oh, dear.\\
325 - You mean you have to move to the
country\\
326 - whether you want to or not?\\
327 - No. But if I don't buy the house, I
lose $500.\\
328 - Well, I don't think that's very nice
of Mr. Spaulding\\
329 - not giving you your money back.\\
330 - Well, honey, on the strength of us
buying his house,\\
331 - he bought another house down the
road,\\
332 - so you can't blame him for holding us
to the deal.\\
333 - I sure wouldn't be as calm as you are\\
334 - if I were losing $500.\\
335 - If you were losing $500, you'd be
foaming at the mouth.\\
336 - Well, I guess that's that.\\
337 - Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.\\
338 - It's all my fault.\\
339 - Maybe... maybe you could take it out
of my allowance\\
340 - for the next 50 years.\\
341 - I have to go to the club, honey.\\
342 - I'll talk to you when I come home.
Good-bye.\\
343 - Bye, Rick.
Bye.\\
344 - So long, Rick.\\
345 - Oh, gee.\\
346 - There must be some way to get that
$500 back.\\
347 - Fred, you know about real estate and
things.\\
348 - Isn't there some way that we can make
Mr. Spaulding\\
349 - give, um, give that deposit back?\\
350 - Well, I don't know.\\
351 - Unless you could fix it some way\\
352 - to make him think you're undesirable,\\
353 - and he didn't want you to have the
house.\\
354 - Hey, that's a good idea.\\
355 - Yeah.\\
356 - Now, let's think.\\
357 - How can we do that?\\
358 - We?\\
359 - How did we get in on this?\\
360 - Well, for heaven's sake, Ethel,\\
361 - You and Fred are the reason that I
don't want to move.\\
362 - The least you can do is help me out
of this fix.\\
363 - Oh, you're right.\\
364 - Let's see now.\\
365 - How can we be undesirable?\\
366 - That shouldn't be hard for you,
Ethel.\\
367 - Never mind now.\\
368 - Just think.\\
369 - Oh, there, there, Eleanor.\\
370 - I can't help it, Gerald.\\
371 - Moving out of this house after 30
years.\\
372 - Well, we're not moving to the North
Pole, my dear.\\
373 - We'll be living right down the road.\\
374 - Oh, it won't be the same.\\
375 - Oh, maybe you should give the
Ricardos their money back.\\
376 - Now, Eleanor, a deal is a deal.\\
377 - And don't forget, we both agreed\\
378 - now that the children are married,\\
379 - we don't need this big house.\\
380 - That's right.\\
381 - Oh, I do hope they're nice people\\
382 - and will take care of it.\\
383 - They seem like very nice people.\\
384 - Well, you never can tell, dear.\\
385 - Remember, they're in show business.\\
386 - Oh, now, Eleanor, we mustn't be
narrow-minded.\\
387 - Some of them are all right.\\
388 - I suppose so.\\
389 - Oh, I'll, uh, I'll see who that is.\\
390 - Hiya, Pops.\\
391 - Uh... oh, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
392 - That's right.\\
393 - Do you mind if I bring a couple my
friends in\\
394 - and case the joint?\\
395 - Uh, well, uh, not at all.\\
396 - I just want to show them around, you
know.\\
397 - Come on in, the coast is clear.\\
398 - I want you to meet a couple friends
of mine,\\
399 - Fred and Ethel Mertz.\\
400 - Uh, how do you do?\\
401 - Hiya, honey.\\
402 - Lay off, baby.\\
403 - Okay.\\
404 - Oh, Eleanor.\\
405 - Oh, hiya, toots.\\
406 - You, uh, you know Mrs. Ricardo,\\
407 - and these are her friends, Fred and
Ethel Mertz.\\
408 - How do you do?
Hi, honey.\\
409 - Lay off, baby.\\
410 - Mrs. Ricardo, you...\\
411 - you don't look at all the way you did
the other day.\\
412 - Your clothes are so different.\\
413 - Oh, you mean that little dark suit
and the hat\\
414 - with the veil and the little white
gloves?\\
415 - Yes, that's right.\\
416 - I was on my way to a masquerade
party.\\
417 - Went as a lady.\\
418 - Well, come on, let's case the joint.\\
419 - Okay.\\
420 - Whoo, boy.\\
421 - Well, nice little hideout.\\
422 - Hideout?\\
423 - He means hideaway.\\
424 - Hey, Fingers, get a load of this.\\
425 - Perfect spot for stashing the ice.\\
426 - Yeah.\\
427 - Ice?\\
428 - Oh, we have a refrigerator.\\
429 - Ah, you're cute, kiddo.\\
430 - Corny, but cute.\\
431 - Leave it to The Brains to pick out a
spot like this.\\
432 - Yeah, they don't call him "The
Brains" for nothing.\\
433 - Brains?\\
434 - Tricky Ricky Ricardo.\\
435 - Your husband?\\
436 - I thought he was a bandleader.\\
437 - He's our leader.\\
438 - We're the band.\\
439 - But he told us he had a rhumba band.\\
440 - Oh, that one again.\\
441 - Don't tell me he used that phony
Spanish accent, too?\\
442 - Whoops!\\
443 - Sorry.\\
444 - Fingers, I thought I told you not to
pack a rod\\
445 - unless we were pulling a job.\\
446 - Now hand it over.\\
447 - Why should I?
You ain't The Brains.\\
448 - No, but I'm Mrs. Brains\\
449 - and don't you forget it, bub.\\
450 - Uh, Mrs. Ricardo...\\
451 - What do you want?\\
452 - Well, uh, Eleanor and I have just
been thinking,\\
453 - and perhaps this isn't the right
house for you after all.\\
454 - Now just a minute.\\
455 - A deal's a deal.\\
456 - The Brains bought this house\\
457 - and gave you his check for a deposit.\\
458 - Well, it's not really a deal unless I
cash the check.\\
459 - Is that so?\\
460 - So what I think I'll do is\\
461 - just return it, nothing personal.\\
462 - That's right, nothing personal.\\
463 - Now The Brains will have to find
another house.\\
464 - He ain't gonna like this.\\
465 - What do I care what he likes?\\
466 - Watch out or you'll step on The
Brains' toes, Fingers.\\
467 - All right, hands up, everybody!\\
468 - Not you, Eleanor.\\
469 - Don't try anything funny.\\
470 - Eleanor, get her purse, that's where
she put the gun.\\
471 - Careful.\\
472 - Uh, Mr. Spaulding, I can explain
everything.\\
473 - You can explain it to the police.\\
474 - Well, I'd rather explain it to you,
sir.\\
475 - No, to the police.\\
476 - And here, you can take your check
back.\\
477 - We don't want your kind of people out
here.\\
478 - Take it, take it.\\
479 - All right, now back up against the
fireplace.\\
480 - You, too, buster.\\
481 - Back up.\\
482 - All right, now turn around.\\
483 - That's better.\\
484 - Oh, Eleanor, see who that is at the
door, and be careful.\\
485 - Higher with the hands!\\
486 - It's The Brains!\\
487 - Mr. Spaulding, what's...\\
488 - All right, get your hands up!\\
489 - What's the matter?\\
490 - Back over here, Brains.
What?\\
491 - Right there.
Back up.\\
492 - Somebody wanna tell me what's go...\\
493 - What are you doing here?\\
494 - Well, I got your deposit back, dear,
here.\\
495 - Oh, good.\\
496 - What are we doing up with our hands
like this?\\
497 - Well, uh, he thinks we're gangsters.\\
498 - Gangsters!\\
499 - That's right, Ricardo.\\
500 - And you can drop that phony Spanish
accent.\\
501 - Huh?\\
502 - We-we-we pretended to be gangsters\\
503 - so that Mr. Spaulding would think we
were undesirable\\
504 - and then wouldn't sell us his house,
see,\\
505 - so we can get your deposit back, and
it worked.\\
506 - Except that we might have to spend
the rest\\
507 - of our lives in the pokey.\\
508 - If my hands weren't up here,\\
509 - they'd be right around your neck.\\
510 - Look, Mr. Spaulding, this is very
simple.\\
511 - My wife just changed her mind...\\
512 - She really didn't make...\\
513 - Back! Back! Back!
Back! Back! Back!\\
514 - I changed my mind, that's all.\\
515 - Mr. Spaulding, I know that it's very
difficult\\
516 - for anybody to believe\\
517 - that anyone would pull a stunt like
this,\\
518 - but you don't know my dizzy wife and
her crackpot friends.\\
519 - Quiet! Quiet!
Quiet!\\
520 - Quiet. The man said quiet.\\
521 - I'd never known such gabby gangsters.\\
522 - Mr. Spaulding, I-I assure you\\
523 - if we could just be alone for a
minute, I could 'splain\\
524 - if I could get in a wordge in
edgewise.\\
525 - Yeah, just let him get a "wordge" in
edgewise\\
526 - and he'll "'splain."\\
527 - Well, yeah, all right.\\
528 - See if he's got a gun, Eleanor, and
be careful.\\
529 - He's clean.\\
530 - That's what they say on Line Up.\\
531 - Well, you, uh, take this and guard
them,\\
532 - and be careful now.\\
533 - All right, Ricardo, come with me.\\
534 - Look out with that thing, lady, now.\\
535 - Right over there.\\
536 - Through that door, and keep your
hands up.\\
537 - Yes, sir.
Yes.\\
538 - I'm an orchestra leader.\\
539 - Yes. Right in there, please.\\
540 - Oh, boy, I could never be a gangster.\\
541 - I don't have the arms for it.\\
542 - You know, Lucy, now that I get a
chance\\
543 - to look around this room, it really
is beautiful.\\
544 - Oh, I know, it's the most charming
house I've ever seen,\\
545 - and you should see the den in the
upstairs.\\
546 - Oh, it's beautiful.\\
547 - Oh, thank you.\\
548 - Oh, don't mention it.\\
549 - Oh, and it's authentic early
American.\\
550 - Yes, it's over a hundred years old.\\
551 - You won't find beamed ceilings like
that\\
552 - in the houses that they build today.\\
553 - No kidding, a hundred years old, huh?\\
554 - Ethel, did you see the fireplace?\\
555 - Yes, I did.\\
556 - And there's one in the master
bedroom, too.\\
557 - And oh, the kitchen.\\
558 - You ought to see the kitchen, Ethel.\\
559 - It's a dream.\\
560 - Lucy, I don't blame you\\
561 - for wanting to move out here.\\
562 - Isn't it wonderful?\\
563 - Beautiful.\\
564 - It's all right, Eleanor.\\
565 - Mr. Ricardo has just convinced me\\
566 - they're not really gangsters.\\
567 - But you wouldn't believe some of the
other things\\
568 - his dizzy wife and her crackpot
friends have done.\\
569 - Well, are you sure he's telling the
truth, Gerald?\\
570 - Yes, ma'am.
Oh, I'm sure\\
571 - for one thing that accent isn't
phony.\\
572 - I could hardly understand his
explanation.\\
573 - But how about that gun?\\
574 - Just a water pistol, see?\\
575 - Just a water pistol.\\
576 - It belongs to our little son.\\
577 - I'm sorry... I'm sorry about all the
misunderstanding,\\
578 - and I think it's very, very nice of
you to let me keep the check.\\
579 - It's quite all right.\\
580 - Uh, Ricky, honey.\\
581 - Yes, dear?\\
582 - What, dear?\\
583 - Give him the check back, honey.\\
584 - What?!\\
585 - I want the house after all.\\
586 - Oh, no!\\
587 - Oh, please, honey, I just got to have
it.\\
588 - Oh...
Please?\\
589 - Are you sure this time?\\
590 - I'm positive.\\
591 - Mr. Spaulding, is the house still for
sale?\\
592 - Yes, it's still for sale, but it'll
cost $500 more.\\
593 - $500 more?!\\
594 - Yes. You frightened Eleanor and me
out of our wits.\\
595 - It'll cost exactly $500 to recover.\\
596 - All right.\\
597 - All right, $500 more.\\
598 - Oh, thank you!\\
599 - Thank you!\\
600 - Oh! I'm sorry.\\
601 - That'll be $550 more.\\
602 - Oh.\\
603 - Happy anniversary, darling.\\
604 - 16 years.\\
605 - Honey?\\
606 - Happy anniversary.
\subsection {Episode 16: Lucy Hates To Leave (1957)}
1 - What's the matter, honey?\\
2 - Oh, nothing, nothing.\\
3 - Oh, honey, it can't be "nothing,
nothing."\\
4 - You don't pace around at 3:00 in the
morning\\
5 - just to put mileage on your new
bedroom slippers.\\
6 - If you want to know the truth,\\
7 - I'm worrying about\\
8 - that new house in the country.\\
9 - Aw, honey.\\
10 - Now, there's nothing to worry about.\\
11 - Mr. Spaulding accepted our offer,\\
12 - the bank's got all the papers,\\
13 - that house is ours.\\
14 - That's what I'm worrying about--\\
15 - that house is ours.\\
16 - Isn't it wonderful?\\
17 - We own a home.\\
18 - What's so wonderful about it?\\
19 - You know how much money that house is
gonna cost me?\\
20 - Yeah, it's gonna cost...\\
21 - Oh, please, don't say it out loud.\\
22 - That house is worth it.\\
23 - Yeah, well.\\
24 - You realize how many times\\
25 - I'm gonna have to sing "Babalu" to
pay for that house?\\
26 - Oh, well, honey, you don't have to
give...\\
27 - give all the money at one time.\\
28 - There's a mortgage.\\
29 - Oh, dear me, a mortgage.\\
30 - Well, now, that'll be paid off in 20
years.\\
31 - 20 years!\\
32 - You realize how old we will be in 20
years?\\
33 - I'll be 56 and you'll be...\\
34 - Never mind.\\
35 - Now, honey, I know how old you are.\\
36 - I know, but I've been juggling my age
for so many years,\\
37 - I've... I've kind of forgotten what
it is\\
38 - and I want to leave it that way.\\
39 - I don't know what made me...\\
40 - decide to buy that place!\\
41 - I must have been out of my mind.\\
42 - Oh, not much.\\
43 - Taxes. There's lots of taxes in that
territory over there.\\
44 - And then you got all those grounds to
keep up\\
45 - and you a big barn house in that
place\\
46 - and you got a chicken house.\\
47 - And what are we going to farm,
anyway?\\
48 - Who do I think I am, old McDougal?\\
49 - Honey, it's old McDonald, and calm
down.\\
50 - There's the heating.\\
51 - It takes a lot to heat a big place
like that, you know.\\
52 - And then...
oh, you gotta buy a new car.\\
53 - And then the money, the...
the train going back and forward\\
54 - from Connecticut to New York all the
time,\\
55 - that's a lot of money.\\
56 - Then the furniture.\\
57 - The furniture.\\
58 - You know how much it's gonna cost\\
59 - to fill that big house with new
furniture?!\\
60 - No, now, honey.\\
61 - No, now, we're gonna use\\
62 - all our of own furniture.\\
63 - We don't have to buy new.\\
64 - This will fit perfectly.
Oh, good! Good!\\
65 - Thank you.\\
66 - Now, honey...\\
67 - That's a big load off my mind.\\
68 - Yeah. Wh-Why don't you go back to bed\\
69 - and just try to relax now, honey?\\
70 - All right, dear.\\
71 - Now come on.\\
72 - All right.\\
73 - Maybe things will look\\
74 - a lot better in the morning.\\
75 - Sure they will, honey.\\
76 - You just got a bad case\\
77 - of homeowners' heebie-jeebies, that's
all.\\
78 - Now, now, relax.\\
79 - You're right, this, this furniture is
nice.\\
80 - Sure, it's fine.\\
81 - This will look good there.\\
82 - Sure it will, honey.\\
83 - It's well-built, this stuff.
Yes, all solid stuff.\\
84 - That's good.\\
85 - And we got a lot of pictures\\
86 - and knickknacks and everything.\\
87 - Yeah, a lot of pictures and
everything.\\
88 - Pleasant dreams, darling.\\
89 - Thank you, honey.\\
90 - Go right to sleep.\\
91 - We won't have to buy anything, maybe.\\
92 - No, honey, nothing.\\
93 - That's good.\\
94 - What's the matter, honey?\\
95 - Nothing, nothing.\\
96 - What do you mean, nothing?
You don't get up at 4:00\\
97 - in the morning for nothing.
What's wrong?\\
98 - Well, maybe we can't afford that
house in the country.\\
99 - Now, dear, calm down, honey, calm
down.\\
100 - How can you be calm with a mortgage\\
101 - staring you in the face?\\
102 - That house won't be ours for 20
years.\\
103 - Oh, now, honey, now, now.\\
104 - It's nothing to cry about.\\
105 - Oh, no? I just figured out how old
I'll be in 20 years!\\
106 - Now, now, you just relax, honey.\\
107 - You were right, honey.
You were right.\\
108 - We just got a bad case\\
109 - of homeowners' jeebie-heebies,\\
110 - Yeah.
that's all.\\
111 - We got the jeebie-heebies all right.\\
112 - Sure. Come on, honey.
Go back to bed, dear.\\
113 - Oh...\\
114 - We'll work out something, honey.\\
115 - Are you sure?\\
116 - Sure, dear.\\
117 - We'll manage somehow.\\
118 - Good night, honey.\\
119 - Good night.\\
120 - Maybe I can get a hit record or
something.\\
121 - You never had one before.\\
122 - That's right, well.\\
123 - Good night, dear.\\
124 - Good night.\\
125 - Now, you're sure, honey,\\
126 - that we're doing the right thing?\\
127 - Positive.\\
128 - We bought the house,\\
129 - we are going to keep it\\
130 - and we're going to be very happy\\
131 - living in the country.\\
132 - Oh, I'm glad you feel that way\\
133 - because I feel just the same way
about it.\\
134 - Good.\\
135 - I'm all ready!\\
136 - Ready for what?\\
137 - Ready to move to the country.\\
138 - Ready to move to the country?\\
139 - Well, we're not moving yet, partner.\\
140 - We're not?\\
141 - No.
No.\\
142 - Not yet, Fred.\\
143 - When are we going, Daddy?\\
144 - Well, in about a week or so.\\
145 - Well, honey,\\
146 - you shouldn't put Fred in a bag like
that.\\
147 - Here, you go on out in the kitchen\\
148 - and give him his breakfast, okay?\\
149 - Okay, Mommy.\\
150 - Okay. He's ready to move to the
country.\\
151 - Can't hardly wait.\\
152 - He's gonna be a farmer.\\
153 - Hi!\\
154 - Oh, hi, Fred.
Hi, Fred.\\
155 - How are you?\\
156 - Fine.\\
157 - I hate to bring this up,\\
158 - but do you remember this?\\
159 - For goodness sake.\\
160 - What's that?\\
161 - Our 99-year lease.\\
162 - Ho, ho!\\
163 - If you recall,\\
164 - I gave it to you two years ago\\
165 - in a sudden fit of friendliness.\\
166 - Now, don't tell me\\
167 - that you're gonna make us stay here
for 97 more years.\\
168 - Of course not.\\
169 - Oh, well, thank you, Fred.\\
170 - That's very decent of you, friend.\\
171 - Now, there's just one thing.
What's that?\\
172 - Since I've let you off the hook for
97 years' rent,\\
173 - I'd like permission to let me show\\
174 - the apartment for two or three days
before you leave.\\
175 - Sure.\\
176 - Oh, sure, that'll be fine, Fred.\\
177 - Of course I'm not gonna barge in on
you.\\
178 - I'm, uh, gonna give plenty of notice.\\
179 - Okay.
Oh, any time at all.\\
180 - Thank you very much.\\
181 - Okay, Fred.
Good-bye.\\
182 - Thank you.\\
183 - Oh, gee, what a sweet guy.\\
184 - Yeah, he's the... the nicest landlord
in the world.\\
185 - Sure.\\
186 - Mm.\\
187 - Wonder who that is.
I don't know.\\
188 - Hi! Well, I've given you notice.\\
189 - I'm showing your apartment!\\
190 - Come right in, folks.\\
191 - Oh.
These are the Ricardos.\\
192 - H-How do you do?\\
193 - Mr. And Mrs. Taylor.\\
194 - - How do you do?
- How do you do?\\
195 - I hope we're not barging in.\\
196 - Oh, no. That's perfectly all right.\\
197 - Not at all, no.\\
198 - This apartment is a perfect\\
199 - love nest for newlyweds.\\
200 - Oh, yes, it certainly is.\\
201 - Oh, are you newlyweds, too?\\
202 - Not exactly.\\
203 - That's our Ricky.\\
204 - It's a little chilly in here.\\
205 - Is it always this cold?\\
206 - Well...\\
207 - Oh, mercy, no! The Ricardos like it
this way.\\
208 - If there's one thing I give my
tenants,\\
209 - it's plenty of heat!\\
210 - What is all that?\\
211 - Oh, who knows?\\
212 - This is only from one closet.\\
213 - Boy, what you can accumulate after 15
years.\\
214 - Yep.\\
215 - You want me to help you, honey?\\
216 - Yeah. Will you put all this stuff\\
217 - over there in that big box?\\
218 - I want to give it to the Salvation
Army.\\
219 - All right, dear.\\
220 - Hi, fellas.\\
221 - Hi.
Hi! Hi!\\
222 - Guess what?\\
223 - What?\\
224 - We rented your apartment.\\
225 - No!\\
226 - To the newlyweds you met yesterday.\\
227 - Oh, they were so nice.\\
228 - Gee, I hope they're gonna be as happy
in here\\
229 - as Ricky and I have been.\\
230 - Yeah.\\
231 - We sure had 15 wonderful years in
this apartment.\\
232 - Oh...\\
233 - Oh, Ethel, not again.\\
234 - Oh, I can't help it.\\
235 - Oh...
Oh...\\
236 - Dry up, honey. We've got a problem to
settle.\\
237 - Yes, I know. I know.\\
238 - What's the problem, Fred?\\
239 - Well, the Taylors will, uh, move in\\
240 - only if they can have the apartment
right away.\\
241 - Tomorrow.
Yeah.\\
242 - Oh, that's impossible!\\
243 - We can't get into our house for four
more days.\\
244 - That's right, Fred, you know, we
can't move\\
245 - until the papers are all signed and
that won't be till Friday.\\
246 - We can't possibly move now.\\
247 - That's the thanks I get for being so
nice.\\
248 - What's so nice about trying to throw
me\\
249 - out of my own apartment?\\
250 - Did I or did I not tear up a lease\\
251 - of yours that had 97 more years to
run?\\
252 - Yeah, so?\\
253 - Do you know how much I saved you\\
254 - by being a good- hearted schnook?\\
255 - Here, look at these figures.\\
256 - $125 a month rent for 97 years\\
257 - comes to $145,500!\\
258 - Oh, oh... no!
Yeah.\\
259 - So that's what you sat up all night
figuring!\\
260 - Yep.\\
261 - Well, Fred, that's very nice of
you,\\
262 - but we can't possibly move out so
fast.\\
263 - Listen, I'm saving you almost 150
grand.\\
264 - The least you could do would be to
move out\\
265 - a couple of measly days ahead of
time.\\
266 - Now, just a minute, Fred!\\
267 - Oh, now, wait a minute, fellas,
there's no problem.\\
268 - It's just for four days.\\
269 - You can move in with us.\\
270 - Well, thanks a lot, Ethel,\\
271 - but what are we gonna do with all of
our furniture?\\
272 - Yeah, it'd be ridiculous\\
273 - to store this for only four days.\\
274 - That's no problem, either.\\
275 - The Taylors like your furniture so
much,\\
276 - they want to buy it.\\
277 - Buy it?!\\
278 - Oh, no, no, we're not gonna sell our
furniture.\\
279 - Wait, wait, wh-why not?\\
280 - Why not?\\
281 - Because we're gonna use it in our new
house!\\
282 - This tacky stuff, it'll never fit in
our new house.\\
283 - What are you talking about?\\
284 - Just... just the other night,\\
285 - you told me it was beautiful
furniture,\\
286 - that it'd fit in there just perfect.\\
287 - Well, honey, that was before I knew\\
288 - anyone was foolish enough to want to
buy it.\\
289 - We can buy all-new furniture.\\
290 - Now just a minute, just a minute.\\
291 - Do you realize how much money it will
cost\\
292 - to furnish that whole new house with
new furniture?\\
293 - Are you gonna quibble about a few
sticks of furniture\\
294 - when you just made $150,000?\\
295 - No... no.\\
296 - All right.\\
297 - I know when I'm licked.\\
298 - Come on, honey.\\
299 - Fred can bring the rest of this
stuff.\\
300 - Okay.\\
301 - Well, Ethel, this is it.\\
302 - This is what?\\
303 - I'll never see this apartment again.\\
304 - Oh, now, let's not get sentimental.\\
305 - It's... just another apartment.\\
306 - Just another apartment?\\
307 - There's 15 years of memories here.\\
308 - Yeah, I know.\\
309 - Do you remember the day I got locked
in the trunk\\
310 - right there?\\
311 - Remember the day\\
312 - we were redecorating the apartment\\
313 - and you wallpapered me into the
closet?\\
314 - How about the day the pressure-cooker
exploded?\\
315 - It took us two days\\
316 - to get the chicken fricassee off the
ceiling!\\
317 - Ooh, I've got to cut this out.\\
318 - I haven't cried so much since the day
I got married.\\
319 - Come on, honey, let's get out of
here.\\
320 - You go ahead, Ethel.
I'll be right over.\\
321 - Okay.\\
322 - Oh.\\
323 - Oh, we're sorry, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
324 - We thought you'd already gone.\\
325 - Oh, that's all right.
I was just leaving.\\
326 - Um, I'll, I'll get all these boxes\\
327 - out of here soon.\\
328 - No hurry.\\
329 - My husband made a list of all the
furniture--\\
330 - this is the inventory-- here.\\
331 - Oh, thank you, thank you.
I'll go over it\\
332 - and I'll give your husband a check
this afternoon.\\
333 - Well, we'll be in the apartment\\
334 - across the hall if you want to see us
about anything.\\
335 - We sure do appreciate\\
336 - your selling us the furniture.\\
337 - Saved us a lot of expense and
trouble.\\
338 - Well, we were glad to do it.\\
339 - I, uh... I sure hope you're going to
be happy here--\\
340 - as happy as we've been.\\
341 - Thank you.
Thank you.\\
342 - Honey, that pink shade\\
343 - will go just fine on this lamp.\\
344 - Pink shade?\\
345 - Yes. I've got a lovely pink shade
that my mother gave me,\\
346 - and it'll look beautiful on this
lamp.\\
347 - Oh.\\
348 - Well, um...\\
349 - this, uh, this shade was made
especially for this lamp,\\
350 - and it's only two years old.\\
351 - It's very nice, but I really think\\
352 - the pink shade will look better.\\
353 - Oh.\\
354 - Uh, would you mind terribly\\
355 - if-if I took this lamp off the
inventory?\\
356 - I'd... I'd kind of like to buy it
back.\\
357 - I guess that'd be all right with us,
huh?\\
358 - I guess so.
Oh, thank you.\\
359 - We can buy another lamp.\\
360 - Thank you very much.\\
361 - You were right, dear.\\
362 - This table will look stunning painted
black.\\
363 - Oh, sure!\\
364 - Black?\\
365 - Yeah.\\
366 - Black?\\
367 - This is getting to look like the
Will-Call Department at Macy's!\\
368 - Oh, now, Fred, it's just for four
days.\\
369 - Why do you have to grumble so much?\\
370 - Because grumbling is my hobby.\\
371 - Like nagging is yours.\\
372 - Oh, honestly, Fred.\\
373 - Hey, you got room for these?\\
374 - Why, honey, I thought the Taylors
bought those things.\\
375 - Well, they did, but they were gonna
ruin them,\\
376 - so I bought them back.\\
377 - Oh. Well, I guess we can make room.\\
378 - Yeah, we can move out.\\
379 - Now, Fred.\\
380 - I guess there's room for that table
in the kitchen.\\
381 - Come on, give me a hand here, will
you, Ethel?\\
382 - Sure, yeah. Come on.\\
383 - There's room in the kitchen.\\
384 - All right. Okay.\\
385 - All right.\\
386 - Excuse me.
Huh?\\
387 - I wonder if I could borrow Mr.
Mertz's saw.\\
388 - Saw?\\
389 - My wife wants to cut the legs off the
sofa.\\
390 - Cut off its legs?!\\
391 - It was my wife's idea.\\
392 - I think I'd better have a little talk
with your wife.\\
393 - Fred?\\
394 - Oh, Fred.\\
395 - I'm over here.\\
396 - Where shall I put this desk chair?\\
397 - How about back in your old apartment?\\
398 - Oh, now, Fred, I got the desk.\\
399 - I might as well have the chair.\\
400 - Lucy, please don't buy back any more
of your old stuff.\\
401 - Don't worry, I won't.\\
402 - Oh, thank goodness.\\
403 - There's nothing else left.\\
404 - Where's Ethel and Little Ricky?\\
405 - They went to the delicatessen to get
some sandwiches.\\
406 - Sandwiches?
Yeah.\\
407 - After the way we've been working,\\
408 - I was kind of looking forward to a
hot meal.\\
409 - Yeah, so was I, but the kitchen is so
jammed full of stuff\\
410 - Ethel couldn't find the stove.\\
411 - Oh, come now, Fred.\\
412 - She could see it all right, but she
couldn't reach it.\\
413 - Aah.\\
414 - Come on, I fixed a little nook back
in here\\
415 - where we can have something to eat.\\
416 - Oh.\\
417 - We're gonna be a little cramped,\\
418 - but we'll have to make it do.\\
419 - Just so I get to sit down for a few
minutes.\\
420 - There's a place for you.\\
421 - Where is everybody?\\
422 - Over here in the
breakfast nook.\\
423 - Where?\\
424 - Here!\\
425 - Where?\\
426 - Here!\\
427 - Oh.\\
428 - Where's Little Ricky?\\
429 - Here I am, Mommy!\\
430 - Here he is.
Oh. Come on here, honey.\\
431 - Go right through there, honey.
Come in this way.\\
432 - Right in through there.\\
433 - Careful. Don't bump your head,
sweetheart.\\
434 - Hurry up, Ethel, I'm starved!\\
435 - I'll be right there.\\
436 - Here you are, honey.\\
437 - Take your coat and hat off.\\
438 - Can I help you, Ethel?\\
439 - Yeah, you can come and get the milk.\\
440 - Okay.\\
441 - Oh.\\
442 - I guess I'd better back up.\\
443 - Thanks.\\
444 - Okay.\\
445 - Ethel, where's my mustard?\\
446 - Oh, I forgot it.\\
447 - I'll have to go out in the kitchen
and get it.\\
448 - Oh.\\
449 - Oh!\\
450 - Fred wants the mustard.\\
451 - Oh. Well, here, you take this.\\
452 - I'll get the mustard.\\
453 - Honey, you'd never be able to find
it.\\
454 - I'll have to get it.\\
455 - Oh.\\
456 - Okay?\\
457 - Kind of crowded.\\
458 - Make it?\\
459 - Whoop!\\
460 - Well, hi, what's new?\\
461 - Mommy?\\
462 - I'm coming, honey.\\
463 - There you are.
There's your milk, honey.\\
464 - I want chocolate milk.\\
465 - You want chocolate milk?\\
466 - Oh, I thought that you wanted plain
milk.\\
467 - I'll go get it.\\
468 - Well, no, no, honey,\\
469 - I don't think you're gonna be able to
find it.\\
470 - I'll have to go with you.\\
471 - Oh, he wants chocolate milk.\\
472 - Oh, well, back up, honey.\\
473 - Then you can get it.\\
474 - Well, Ethel, you back up.\\
475 - I backed up the last two times.\\
476 - Ethel, where's my mustard?\\
477 - I got a hungry husband.\\
478 - Well, I got a thirsty child.\\
479 - Back up.
Okay.\\
480 - There we are.\\
481 - Now, now, honey, don't bump your
head.\\
482 - There we are.\\
483 - No, this is the wrong mustard.\\
484 - I wanted hot mustard!\\
485 - If you want hot mustard, you
go get it yourself!\\
486 - Lucy, would you mind backing up?\\
487 - I want hot mustard on my sandwich and
I'm starved!\\
488 - Well, Fred, you back up.\\
489 - I have a thirsty child.\\
490 - Little Ricky, where are you?\\
491 - Here, Mommy.\\
492 - How'd you get back there?\\
493 - I took a shortcut under the
furniture.\\
494 - He took a shortcut under the
furniture!\\
495 - Isn't that cute?\\
496 - Do you mind if I play through?\\
497 - Go ahead.\\
498 - Thank you.\\
499 - Hello, Moby.\\
500 - Excuse me.\\
501 - Thank you.\\
502 - Oh, I forgot the salt.\\
503 - Back up, Fred.\\
504 - You back up.\\
505 - I will not.\\
506 - Well, neither will I.\\
507 - Well, we'll just see about that.\\
508 - Now come on!\\
509 - All right, we will see about that!\\
510 - Oh, Fred, come on!\\
511 - Back up!
You back up!\\
512 - Come on now.\\
513 - Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!\\
514 - Why push me?
I'm an innocent bystander.\\
515 - Come on now, Ethel, back up.\\
516 - No.\\
517 - Fred?\\
518 - No!\\
519 - We could starve to death this way.\\
520 - Oh, okay, I give up.
Let's eat.\\
521 - So stubborn.\\
522 - Stubborn?\\
523 - Lucy?\\
524 - How are you gonna explain all this to
Ricky?\\
525 - Explain all what?\\
526 - About buying all your old
furniture back.\\
527 - Listen, I convinced him it was
right to sell it,\\
528 - so I'll convince him it was right to
buy it back.\\
529 - You know I have Ricky trained.\\
530 - He's putty in my hands.\\
531 - Lucy!\\
532 - Speak of the putty.\\
533 - Lucy, where are you?\\
534 - Lucy!\\
535 - Lucy, where are you?\\
536 - Come out here!\\
537 - Lucy, I want to speak to you!\\
538 - Lucy!\\
539 - Lucy!\\
540 - Oh, hi, Fred.
Hi.\\
541 - Where'd she go?\\
542 - She took the shortcut to the
kitchen.\\
543 - You stool pigeon!\\
544 - You come here.
I want to talk to you.\\
545 - No.
Come right here!\\
546 - I want to talk to you.
No!\\
547 - Not till you calm down.\\
548 - All right, I can take the shortcut,
too.\\
549 - Ah, ah, aha!\\
550 - All right, start explaining.\\
551 - Well, the Taylors were ruining our
furniture,\\
552 - so I bought it all back.\\
553 - You bought it all back?!\\
554 - They wanted to put a pink shade on
our lamp.\\
555 - They wanted to cut the legs off our
sofa.\\
556 - The phone is ringing, Fred.\\
557 - And they wanted to paint our table
black.\\
558 - All right, I'll talk to you later.
Where's the phone?\\
559 - They were ruining everything...
I'll find it.\\
560 - Look for the phone!
I'll talk to you later.\\
561 - No.\\
562 - Hello? Hello?\\
563 - That's Little Ricky's phone.\\
564 - Oh.\\
565 - Hello?\\
566 - Yes, this is Mr. Ricardo.\\
567 - Oh, hello, Mr. Spaulding.\\
568 - All right, fine.\\
569 - Well, we're planning to move in four
days.\\
570 - Yes, sir.\\
571 - What?\\
572 - They have?\\
573 - It was?\\
574 - Oh...\\
575 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
576 - Well, thanks for calling.
Good-bye.\\
577 - What'd he say?\\
578 - The title search for the house has
been delayed.\\
579 - We will have to stay here two more
weeks.\\
580 - Eww...\\
581 - Oh, now, honey...\\
582 - Honey...\\
583 - Now...
\subsection {Episode 17: Lucy Misses The Mertzes (1957)}
1 - Gee, Ethel, this place has been in
such a mess\\
2 - for the last two weeks, I bet you'll
be glad to get rid of us.\\
3 - Aw, Lucy, how can you be like that?\\
4 - We just loved having you.\\
5 - Thank you, dear.\\
6 - This the last of it, ma'am?\\
7 - Yes, that's it.
Thank you.\\
8 - Honey, we'll take these two bags in
the car, huh?\\
9 - Okay.
Car? What car?\\
10 - Oh, didn't Ricky tell you?\\
11 - We rented a station wagon\\
12 - to use in the country till we get
settled.\\
13 - Station wagon, huh?
Pretty snappy.\\
14 - Yeah, I'm going to be a regular
country square.\\
15 - Honey, it's country squire.\\
16 - Well, whatever it is, you know,\\
17 - we're gonna be real suburbaneeties.\\
18 - Suburbaneeties?\\
19 - He means "suburbanites."\\
20 - Oh.\\
21 - I just hope we can cross the border
into Connecticut\\
22 - without a passport.\\
23 - Oh, never mind.\\
24 - Get your coat, honey.\\
25 - It's time for us to go.\\
26 - Remember now, you two, no more
bawling.\\
27 - That's right, Lucy.\\
28 - This isn't good-bye.\\
29 - It's just toodle-oo.\\
30 - Yeah. Toodle-oo...\\
31 - Oh, no, there she goes again.\\
32 - Come on now, honey, buck up.\\
33 - Yeah, honey,\\
34 - they'll come out and see us real

54 - Well...\\
55 - I guess this is it, Fred, huh?\\
56 - Rick, old man, I sure hate to see you
go,\\
57 - not just because you paid your rent
on time...\\
58 - but because you've been a wonderful
friend.\\
59 - Thank you, Fred.\\
60 - You've been kind of wonderful
yourself.\\
61 - Thank you, Ricky.\\
62 - We sure had a wonderful 15 years.\\
63 - We sure did.\\
64 - Well...\\
65 - so long, everybody.\\
66 - Lucy?\\
67 - I don't want to go.\\
68 - Honey, get ahold of yourself
there.\\
69 - Yes, now.\\
70 - You just march right through that
door\\
71 - and don't look back.\\
72 - I'm proud of you, Ethel.\\
73 - You, you, you didn't even whimper.\\
74 - Well, now, honey, isn't this a
wonderful house?\\
75 - Boy, I'll say.\\
76 - Come on, Fred, I'll show you the
kitchen.\\
77 - Show him where he's gonna sleep.\\
78 - There you are.\\
79 - Well, it's nice being of service to
you, Mr. Ricardo.\\
80 - I hope you folks enjoy your new home.\\
81 - Thank you very much.\\
82 - Thanks a lot.\\
83 - Well, here we are.\\
84 - No more tears, honey?\\
85 - Oh, no. I'm fine now that we're here.\\
86 - Gee, isn't this exciting?\\
87 - We're in our very own home.\\
88 - The first house we ever had.\\
89 - Our first house.\\
90 - Come here.\\
91 - Where you going?\\
92 - Come here, come here,\\
93 - come here, come here,\\
94 - come here, come here.\\
95 - What are you doing, honey?\\
96 - Hey!\\
97 - Why are you doing that, Daddy?\\
98 - Well, you see, that's a...\\
99 - It's a tradition, son.\\
100 - When, uh... whenever you bring
someone you love\\
101 - into a new home,\\
102 - you carry them across the threshold.\\
103 - And that is the threshold.\\
104 - See?
Oh.\\
105 - That's a very sweet thing to do,
honey.\\
106 - Come on, Fred, I'll show you my room.\\
107 - Yeah, show him your room.\\
108 - Isn't that sweet?\\
109 - Oh, gee, honey, I just can't believe
we're really here.\\
110 - You know, we should be awfully happy
in this house.\\
111 - It's so quiet and peaceful.\\
112 - Yeah, no noise.\\
113 - No dust.\\
114 - No traffic.\\
115 - No Mertzes.\\
116 - Oh, now, now.\\
117 - Package for Mr.
and Mrs. Ricardo.\\
118 - Oh, isn't that nice?\\
119 - Thank you.
Wait a minute.\\
120 - Here. Here you are.\\
121 - Thanks. Welcome to Westport.\\
122 - Thank you very much.\\
123 - Thank you.\\
124 - Isn't that nice?\\
125 - Who could have sent that?\\
126 - There's a card there, I think.\\
127 - "Lots of happiness in your new home\\
128 - from your dear friends, Fred and
Ethel."\\
129 - Oh, how about that?\\
130 - Oh, wasn't that sweet of them?\\
131 - Oh, boy, this must have set Fred back
ten bucks.\\
132 - You know, they must feel just as sad
as we do.\\
133 - Sad?\\
134 - For Fred to spend $10 on a basket of
fruit,\\
135 - he must have been hysterical.\\
136 - Where are you going, honey?\\
137 - I'm gonna call up and thank them
right now.\\
138 - Well, honey, the phone is not
connected.\\
139 - Oh, that's right.\\
140 - Hey, let's drive in and thank them
right now.\\
141 - Drive in? We just drove out.\\
142 - We got a lot of unpacking to do,
honey.\\
143 - Let's get going.
Yeah, you're right.\\
144 - Where should we start?\\
145 - Well, let's start right here.\\
146 - Oh, boy.\\
147 - After all that unpacking,\\
148 - I can sure use a good night's sleep.\\
149 - Me, too.\\
150 - Hey, we ought to sleep real good
here--\\
151 - no city noises.\\
152 - Yeah, it should be nice and quiet for
a change.\\
153 - Good night, honey.\\
154 - Good night.\\
155 - You think I'd better put another
blanket on Little Ricky's bed?\\
156 - Oh, no, honey.\\
157 - The furnace keeps this house nice and
warm.\\
158 - Okay.\\
159 - What are you laughing at?\\
160 - This is the first time in 15 years\\
161 - that I haven't had to call Fred and
ask him for more heat.\\
162 - Oh, that's right.\\
163 - Oh, Fred and Ethel, I sure do miss
them.\\
164 - Now, now, honey. Good night.\\
165 - Good night.\\
166 - Ricky?\\
167 - Huh?\\
168 - Are you asleep?\\
169 - No.\\
170 - It sure is quiet out here.\\
171 - Yeah, nice and quiet.\\
172 - I never heard so much quiet.\\
173 - Well, you'll get used to it.\\
174 - Good night.\\
175 - Good night.\\
176 - If you ask me, it's a little too
quiet.\\
177 - I know what you mean.\\
178 - I wish a taxi would go by or
something.\\
179 - Or a fire engine.\\
180 - One of those lovely, rattly garbage
trucks.\\
181 - Well, let's try to get some sleep,
dear.\\
182 - Good night.\\
183 - Good night.\\
184 - Ricky?\\
185 - Yeah?\\
186 - This quiet is so loud, I can't sleep.\\
187 - Well, force yourself.\\
188 - What's that?\\
189 - I don't know.\\
190 - Move over.\\
191 - What is that?\\
192 - Well, it sounds like a squirrel on
top of the roof.\\
193 - I think.\\
194 - A squirrel?\\
195 - I think.\\
196 - Mommy! Daddy!\\
197 - What's the matter, son?\\
198 - I'm scared.\\
199 - Scared? Well, it's nothing to be
scared of.\\
200 - Move over, Daddy.\\
201 - Move over, dear.\\
202 - What have you got in there?\\
203 - Fred. He's scared, too.\\
204 - Oh, dear.
Aw...\\
205 - He's got Fred with him.\\
206 - Oh...\\
207 - Come on, Fred.\\
208 - Fred.\\
209 - Lie down, Fred, now, come on.\\
210 - Everybody go to sleep now.\\
211 - Come on, Fred.\\
212 - Isn't it funny how you get used to
sleeping around noise?\\
213 - Yeah. They say it's even better\\
214 - when you get used to sleeping around
quiet.\\
215 - Maybe I could sleep better if you
took up snoring.\\
216 - How can I take up snoring if I can't
fall asleep?\\
217 - Well, you sure got a point there.\\
218 - Ah, well...\\
219 - Hey, we sure could use some help
around here.\\
220 - We sure could use some help.\\
221 - Ethel!\\
222 - Honey, Ethel is not there anymore.\\
223 - Oh, my goodness, I forgot.\\
224 - Well, after 15 years,\\
225 - it's kind of hard to break a habit.\\
226 - What's in this box here?\\
227 - That's Ricky's stuff--\\
228 - books and toys and things--\\
229 - they go upstairs.\\
230 - Oh, this is heavy.\\
231 - Oh, I'll help you, dear.\\
232 - No, it's too heavy for you to carry,
honey.\\
233 - I'll just go across the hall and
get...\\
234 - Fred isn't over there anymore,
either.\\
235 - I forgot, too.\\
236 - Come on, help me in the kitchen,
honey.\\
237 - All right.\\
238 - I'll be right there, honey!\\
239 - Who are you talking to?\\
240 - I thought I heard Lucy calling me.\\
241 - Oh, good grief, Ethel.\\
242 - Get hold of yourself.\\
243 - They've gone, so we'll just have to
get used to it.\\
244 - I know.\\
245 - Yeah.\\
246 - Hey, there's a great fight at the
Garden\\
247 - Saturday night.\\
248 - I wonder who could get me some
passes.\\
249 - Where were you going?\\
250 - No place.\\
251 - Oh, yes, you were.\\
252 - You were going over to see Ricky,
weren't you?\\
253 - Certainly not. I was going around to
see Mrs. Trumbull.\\
254 - Oh, sure, Mrs. Trumbull\\
255 - always has passes to the fights.\\
256 - You don't have the monopoly on
missing people, you know.\\
257 - Oh, dear.\\
258 - Aw, there, there, honeybunch.\\
259 - Oh, I know...\\
260 - Harry, it was so nice of you\\
261 - to invite Little Ricky\\
262 - to stay overnight at your house.\\
263 - Oh, he and Billy will have a great
time.\\
264 - I'm sure they will.\\
265 - Now, you be a good boy, sweetheart,\\
266 - and mind Mrs. Munson.\\
267 - Yes.
All right, sweetheart.\\
268 - Good luck.
Have a good time.\\
269 - Bye-bye, darling.\\
270 - Bye!
Bye!\\
271 - Good night. Now, don't worry
about him.\\
272 - We'll take good care of him.\\
273 - Okay. All right.\\
274 - Well, here we are.\\
275 - Yup, here we are.\\
276 - Just the two of us, all alone in the
country.\\
277 - Yup, all alone in the country.\\
278 - What do we do, all alone in the
country?\\
279 - I don't know.\\
280 - I got an idea.\\
281 - What?\\
282 - Let's go to the city.\\
283 - Go to the city?
What are we going to do there?\\
284 - Well, we could have dinner and maybe
see a show and...\\
285 - and if we have time,\\
286 - or just happen to be in the
neighborhood...\\
287 - we're going to see the Mertzes!\\
288 - What do you think we're gonna do?\\
289 - Hey, that's a wonderful idea.\\
290 - I'll check the train schedules.\\
291 - Okay. Gee, I'm dying to see them.\\
292 - I wonder if they've changed.\\
293 - Changed?\\
294 - We only left them a day and a half
ago.\\
295 - Oh, yeah.\\
296 - Oh, we missed that train,\\
297 - but there's another one in two hours.\\
298 - Well, let's drive.\\
299 - No, I think it's going to snow.\\
300 - I don't want to take a chance.\\
301 - We'll leave the car at the station
and call them\\
302 - from there to see if they're home.\\
303 - Did you find a good movie?\\
304 - No, there's nothing around.\\
305 - Oh.\\
306 - Well, you want to watch some
television?\\
307 - Not tonight.\\
308 - Want to play some gin rummy?\\
309 - Uh-uh. I don't feel like it.\\
310 - Well, I suppose we could just sit and
talk.\\
311 - Okay. Who will we talk to?\\
312 - To each other.\\
313 - Oh, come now, Ethel.\\
314 - Well, there must be something we can
do.\\
315 - Fred, are you willing to be a good
sport?\\
316 - What are you suggesting?\\
317 - Let's go out to the country and see
the Ricardos.\\
318 - Ethel, that's the greatest idea you
ever had.\\
319 - I'll check and see if they're home.\\
320 - Oh, no, don't call them.\\
321 - Let's surprise them.\\
322 - They're bound to be home.\\
323 - Where would you go in the country?\\
324 - I'll look up the schedule\\
325 - and see what time the next train
goes.\\
326 - Ooh, it's so windy.\\
327 - It's cold, too.\\
328 - You call the Mertzes.
I'm going to fix my hair.\\
329 - It's a mess.
All right, dear.\\
330 - Some wind, huh?\\
331 - Yeah.\\
332 - Hey, we'd better call the Ricardos.\\
333 - Oh, no, let's take a taxi and
surprise them.\\
334 - Now, listen, I spent two bucks on
taxi fare to Grand Central,\\
335 - $6.16 on train tickets.\\
336 - Isn't that surprise enough?\\
337 - Come on, ask him to drive over and to
pick us up.\\
338 - Oh, all right.\\
339 - Somebody's using the phone.\\
340 - Um, mister, is there another phone
around here?\\
341 - There's one out on the
platform.\\
342 - Thank you.
I'll be right back.\\
343 - All right.\\
344 - Well, what'd they say?\\
345 - They're not home.\\
346 - Not home? Oh, the operator\\
347 - must have been ringing the wrong
number.\\
348 - No. That's what I thought at first.\\
349 - I asked her to ring it again and
nobody answered.\\
350 - Oh, what'll we do now?\\
351 - Go home and go back to sleep.\\
352 - At 8:30?\\
353 - Listen, I didn't get any sleep last
night\\
354 - listening to that quiet.\\
355 - Oh...\\
356 - Well?\\
357 - I couldn't use the phone.\\
358 - Some teenager was talking to her
girlfriend\\
359 - about that Elvis what's-his-name.\\
360 - You can use that phone over there
now.\\
361 - Fred, you call them. I want to fix up
just a little, huh?\\
362 - All right.\\
363 - Oh, how do you like that?\\
364 - Well, a flat tire.\\
365 - Well, call a garage.\\
366 - Somebody using the phone.\\
367 - Oh.\\
368 - Have you got a garage out here\\
369 - that I can call?
I got a flat tire.\\
370 - Yeah, but they all close at 6:00.\\
371 - Oh, dear.\\
372 - How are we gonna get home?\\
373 - Hey, you're in luck, mister.
A cab just drove up.\\
374 - Oh, good. Come on, honey. Thank you.\\
375 - I'll take care of the car in the
morning.\\
376 - From the back, that man looks just
like Fred Mertz.\\
377 - You're lonesomer than I thought.\\
378 - Well?\\
379 - Well, first the operator couldn't
find their number,\\
380 - and then she discovered\\
381 - that their phone hasn't been
connected yet.\\
382 - Then we'll have to take a taxi.\\
383 - Well, okay.\\
384 - Mister, where's the cab stand?\\
385 - Right out there.\\
386 - The cab just left.\\
387 - Good.\\
388 - What do you mean, good?\\
389 - Well, it's not far.
We can walk.\\
390 - Walk? It's cold out there!\\
391 - Walking in the cold air is very
healthy.\\
392 - Since when?\\
393 - Since now. Come on.\\
394 - Oh, Fred.\\
395 - I can open it.\\
396 - Good thing she gave me a key.\\
397 - Yeah.\\
398 - Ethel, the car is not in the garage,\\
399 - the house is dark-- they're not home.\\
400 - Why are we coming in?\\
401 - To wait for them.\\
402 - What else do you suggest?\\
403 - We'll walk back to the station and go
home.\\
404 - Walk way back there?!\\
405 - Over my dead body.\\
406 - Don't tempt me, Ethel.\\
407 - Oh, pooh.\\
408 - Gee, the place is shaping up nicely.\\
409 - Yeah, isn't it?\\
410 - There's that basket of fruit we sent
them.\\
411 - Yeah.\\
412 - Well, we might as well get some
return on our investment.\\
413 - That wind makes it seem kind of
spooky out here, doesn't it?\\
414 - It certainly does.\\
415 - Gee, these new shoes hurt.\\
416 - When you spend $16 for shoes, they're
not supposed to hurt.\\
417 - You don't buy $16 shoes for comfort,\\
418 - you buy them for looks.\\
419 - Then you ought to walk on your hands\\
420 - so people can see your feet.\\
421 - Oh, dry up, will you?\\
422 - Sure.
Ooh...\\
423 - Ah-ha.\\
424 - Ricky.\\
425 - Hmm?\\
426 - Ricky.
Hmm?\\
427 - Ricky, wake up.
Yes, what?\\
428 - I heard something downstairs.\\
429 - What?\\
430 - I heard something downstairs.\\
431 - You must have been dreaming, then.\\
432 - No, I distinctly heard a noise
downstairs.\\
433 - It's the wind. There's a lot of wind
outside.\\
434 - Would the wind blow the lights on?\\
435 - What, the lights?\\
436 - The lights are on.\\
437 - The lights downstairs?\\
438 - We got burglars.\\
439 - Burglars, honey?\\
440 - Come on.\\
441 - Yeah?\\
442 - Shh!\\
443 - Did you hear that?\\
444 - Yeah. What was it?\\
445 - There's someone upstairs.\\
446 - It must be a burglar.\\
447 - Let's get out of here.\\
448 - It must have been your imagination.\\
449 - I just forgot to turn out the lights,
that's all.\\
450 - Did you forget to turn out the fruit?\\
451 - See, someone has been here.\\
452 - Maybe they're outside.\\
453 - Get the flashlight.\\
454 - Come on, I think he's
gone.\\
455 - Hurry up, Fred.\\
456 - It's so cold.\\
457 - Well, honey, if anybody was here,
they're gone.\\
458 - Maybe they were just hungry or
something.\\
459 - Yeah, maybe that's right.\\
460 - Go get 'em, Ricky, go get 'em.\\
461 - I don't want to go get them.\\
462 - Well, you were looking for 'em.\\
463 - Yeah, but I didn't want to find them.\\
464 - Hide in there.\\
465 - This is the most ridiculous thing
I've heard of.\\
466 - I paid 16 bucks for those shoes\\
467 - and we're not leaving them here.\\
468 - Hurry up!\\
469 - Out of my way, Ethel!
Out of my way, Ethel!\\
470 - Ethel?!\\
471 - Ethel!
Ethel!!\\
472 - Lucy!\\
473 - Fred!\\
474 - Ricky!\\
475 - Oh, my goodness.\\
476 - We thought you were burglars.\\
477 - We thought you were burglars.\\
478 - We were just coming in to visit you.\\
479 - Oh, honey,\\
480 - we came out here to see you\\
481 - and surprise you.\\
482 - We missed...
We missed you so.\\
483 - Oh, Lucy, we missed you so much.\\
484 - Oh, there they go again.
\subsection {Episode 18: Lucy Gets Chummy With The Neighbors (1957)}
1 - Breakfast ready, honey?\\
2 - Lucy?\\
3 - Oh, there you are.\\
4 - Oh, good morning, darling.\\
5 - Where you been?\\
6 - Well, we were out of bread, so I went
next door\\
7 - to the Ramseys' to borrow some.\\
8 - Oh.\\
9 - Oh, gee, that Betty Ramsey is a nice
person.\\
10 - And so is Ralph, her husband.
You're just gonna love him.\\
11 - We're sure lucky to have such good
neighbors.\\
12 - Look, honey, uh...
I don't think it's a good idea\\
13 - to get too friendly with the
neighbors too fast.\\
14 - Why not? We're gonna be living here
the rest of our lives.\\
15 - Why shouldn't we get friendly with
the neighbors right away?\\
16 - That's just it.\\
17 - We are gonna be here for the rest of
our lives,\\
18 - so I think that we get... that we
should get chummy gradually.\\
19 - Oh, well, maybe you can get chummy
gradually.\\
20 - With me, it's instant chummy.\\
21 - Well, I still say\\
22 - that you shouldn't rush into
friendships.\\
23 - Oh, pish-tush.\\
24 - There you are, some nice, neighborly
toast.\\
25 - I'll have some nice, unneighborly
jelly.\\
26 - Okay, dear, I'll get it.
Thank you.\\
27 - Gee, you should see the Ramseys'
house.\\
28 - It's all done in the most beautiful
early American.\\
29 - I'm getting some wonderful ideas from
Betty\\
30 - for redecorating our house.\\
31 - In the far distant future, of course.\\
32 - Here you are, doll.\\
33 - Thank you.\\
34 - Blech!\\
35 - Tush-sheesh!\\
36 - Ugh!\\
37 - Why don't you ask me what's the
matter?\\
38 - I can't afford to ask you what's the
matter.\\
39 - Honey, our old furniture looks just
awful\\
40 - in our beautiful new house.\\
41 - you said that our furniture would
look perfect in here.\\
42 - Well, we haven't got enough furniture
for this big place.\\
43 - Aw, gee, honey, please, can't I buy
just one new thing?\\
44 - All right, I guess we could afford
one new thing.\\
45 - What's it gonna be?\\
46 - One house full of furniture.\\
47 - One downstairs full of furniture?\\
48 - One living room full of furniture?\\
49 - Oh, if you put some seeds in you
head,\\
50 - you could use it for a maraca.\\
51 - Look, Lucy, we just cannot afford\\
52 - a lot of new furniture right now.\\
53 - But this stuff looks so awful.\\
54 - Look, why can't we put all this in
the den\\
55 - and then all we'd need is just a few
basic things,\\
56 - you know, like a... a table and a
lamp and a little old rug.\\
57 - Oh, please, honey, please?\\
58 - All right, all right.\\
59 - You can buy $500 worth of furniture\\
60 - and not a penny more.\\
61 - Oh, thank you, honey.
Thank you so much.\\
62 - All right.\\
63 - Well, good morning, Bruce.\\
64 - Hello.\\
65 - Hi. Honey, you know Bruce Ramsey?\\
66 - Oh, yeah.
Hi, Bruce.\\
67 - Hi. Is Little Ricky here?\\
68 - Yes, sweetheart.\\
69 - He's here.
He's upstairs.\\
70 - Go on up.\\
71 - Little Ricky, Bruce is here!\\
72 - Hi, Ramsey.\\
73 - Hi, Ricardo.\\
74 - Oh, isn't that cute?\\
75 - Ramsey and Ricardo.\\
76 - How about that.\\
77 - I got to go.\\
78 - I got to catch the 9:20.\\
79 - Oh, okay, darling.\\
80 - Bye-bye, sweetheart.\\
81 - Good-bye, honey.\\
82 - Now, only $500.\\
83 - I know, $500. I have it engraved
right here.\\
84 - All right.\\
85 - Bye-bye.
Bye.\\
86 - Oh!\\
87 - Come on in, Betty.\\
88 - Hi!
Hi, dear.\\
89 - Lucy, guess what.
What?\\
90 - You remember your telling me about\\
91 - wanting to buy new furniture?
Yes.\\
92 - Well, I just talked to Ralph on the
phone\\
93 - and he's arranged for us\\
94 - to go to a wholesale furniture place
this afternoon.\\
95 - Oh, how wonderful!\\
96 - And I just talked to Ricky\\
97 - and he said, "Go ahead, buy a few
things."\\
98 - Oh, good!\\
99 - How about that?
You want some coffee?\\
100 - I'd love some.\\
101 - Oh, really, they have simply gorgeous
things at this place,\\
102 - and I can get you 40% discount on
everything you buy.\\
103 - Oh, that's great!\\
104 - Let's see, 40% of five...\\
105 - of, uh... of what Ricky said I could
spend...\\
106 - Why, I can get almost twice as much
as I thought I could.\\
107 - Oh, you're so lucky, Lucy.\\
108 - You know, most husbands would raise
quite a fuss\\
109 - if their wives wanted to redecorate.\\
110 - Ricky must be very generous.\\
111 - Oh, yes, he is very generous in his
own little way.\\
112 - Of course, someone in Ricky's
position\\
113 - doesn't have to worry about money.\\
114 - No.\\
115 - Well, now, let's see.\\
116 - Um... we'll do the whole living room
and dining room\\
117 - in early American.\\
118 - We will? The whole thing?\\
119 - Oh, well, I, uh...\\
120 - I kind of wanted to keep a couple of
the old pieces\\
121 - for sentimental reasons, you know.\\
122 - Oh, no, no, no, dear,\\
123 - you don't want to mix this beat-up
old stuff\\
124 - with your lovely new things.\\
125 - Well, I don't want to, but...\\
126 - You know what we should do with this?\\
127 - Set fire to it?\\
128 - No, trade it in, get an allowance on
the new furniture.\\
129 - That way, you'll save even more
money.\\
130 - Trade it in!
That's a great idea!\\
131 - Now, I think we should put two wing
chairs here.\\
132 - Two wing chairs, yeah.\\
133 - And a big sofa here...
maybe even two sofas.\\
134 - Two sofas!\\
135 - Yes.\\
136 - Now, let's see. we picked out
the whole dining room set,\\
137 - the buffet, the two chairs\\
138 - the couch, the bench, end tables...\\
139 - Uh, now, we decide on a coffee table.\\
140 - Uh-huh.\\
141 - Well, how about this one?\\
142 - Yes, yes.
That's very nice.\\
143 - How about that one over there, Betty?\\
144 - Could be.\\
145 - Uh, yeah, now that I get a better
look at this,\\
146 - this is fine.\\
147 - Yes, I like that.\\
148 - I like the shape there.\\
149 - Mm-hmm. Now, lamps.\\
150 - That's attractive.\\
151 - Oh, isn't it? Yes.\\
152 - Uh... how about that one over there?\\
153 - Sometimes at parties,\\
154 - our friends like to try on lampshades
for hats.\\
155 - I was just making sure it was the
right size.\\
156 - Oh, Lucy, you're such a clown.\\
157 - Yeah, well...\\
158 - Say, you know, Betty,\\
159 - I can't get over how inexpensive\\
160 - all this furniture is.\\
161 - What do you mean, dear?\\
162 - Mr. Perry hasn't quoted prices yet.\\
163 - Oh, well, I just casually happened to
glance\\
164 - at some of the price tags,\\
165 - and there's some real bargains here.\\
166 - Price tags?\\
167 - Yeah. You know, like, for instance,\\
168 - here's one right here.\\
169 - See, this table is $10.62.\\
170 - Oh, Lucy, there you go clowning.\\
171 - Those aren't price tags.\\
172 - They're stock numbers.\\
173 - Stock numbers?!\\
174 - Uh, Mrs. Ramsey, Yes.\\
175 - I've, uh, been going over Mrs.
Ricardo's purchases,\\
176 - like you asked me to,\\
177 - and the furniture that she has
selected so far\\
178 - less the 40% discount, of course,\\
179 - and the allowance on her old
furniture\\
180 - comes to exactly $1,875.50.\\
181 - We like to do these little favors for
our friends.\\
182 - $1,875.50?\\
183 - That price is fantastic.\\
184 - You can say that again.\\
185 - Now, Mr. Perry, do you have any more
lamps\\
186 - besides this because\\
187 - I don't think any of these are right\\
188 - for Mrs. Ricardo.\\
189 - I have just the thing for you.\\
190 - Look, Betty...	  Oh, good.\\
191 - Betty...\\
192 - maybe I shouldn't have rushed into
this.\\
193 - Maybe I shouldn't buy so much all at
once.\\
194 - Maybe I should just buy a-a chair or
a lamp\\
195 - or a little old table or something.\\
196 - But dear, why not buy everything all
at once?\\
197 - Yeah, why not?\\
198 - Well, because... I sort of like to
have furniture trickle in\\
199 - one at a time, you know.\\
200 - Like a Chair-Of-The-Month Club.\\
201 - Stop clowning, Lucy.\\
202 - Here we are.\\
203 - Oh, that's very nice.\\
204 - Uh, to tell you the truth, Betty,\\
205 - I... I... I need everything by
Saturday night.\\
206 - Yeah, we're having some friends in
Saturday night\\
207 - and if we can't have everything by
Saturday night--\\
208 - and I know that's impossible--\\
209 - why, then I'm afraid I won't be able
to take any of it.\\
210 - But just so the afternoon won't be a
total loss, I'll, um...\\
211 - I'll take this little footstool here.\\
212 - Saturday night?\\
213 - Oh, my, that is awfully fast.\\
214 - Yes, I knew it would be, so if you'd
just wrap it up...\\
215 - But since you are\\
216 - such a good friend of Mrs. Ramsey's,
I'll do it.\\
217 - Thanks a lot.\\
218 - Er, this is $24.50.\\
219 - I'll just put it with your other
furniture.\\
220 - Thank you so much, Mr. Perry.\\
221 - Oh, come on, Lucy, we've got lots of
other things to look at.\\
222 - We haven't even started on the den
yet, dear.\\
223 - Yeah, why not? What have I got to
lose except my life?\\
224 - What?\\
225 - Oh, there I go, clowning again.\\
226 - Well, here it is, Lucy-- all your new
furniture.\\
227 - Yeah, here it is.\\
228 - I'll bet Ricky raves when he sees
this.\\
229 - He'll rave all right.\\
230 - Of course you'll still need a few
knickknacks and things,\\
231 - but we can get those next week.\\
232 - Listen, I have to run now, dear, but
I'll see you later, okay?\\
233 - Bye.
Okay. Okay, Betty. Bye.\\
234 - Operator, can I have Schuyler 4-8098,
New York City, please?\\
235 - Hello?\\
236 - Oh, I'm in terrible trouble.\\
237 - Can you come out right away?\\
238 - What's the matter?
What's up?\\
239 - Who is it?\\
240 - It's Lucy and she's in trouble!\\
241 - Quick, hang up!\\
242 - Oh, Fred.\\
243 - Is it bad trouble, honey?\\
244 - Well, Ricky told me that I could
spend $500\\
245 - for some new furniture\\
246 - and I got carried away and I spent
over thr...\\
247 - I... I spent over thr...\\
248 - How much? How much?\\
249 - I spent over $3,000.\\
250 - $3,000?!\\
251 - What, what, what about $3,000?\\
252 - Ricky told Lucy she could spend $500\\
253 - for some new furniture, and she spent
over $3,000!\\
254 - Now, Fred...\\
255 - Fred, loosen your collar so you won't
faint.\\
256 - Fred, it's not your money.\\
257 - Lucy?\\
258 - What happened to Fred?\\
259 - Oh, he got lightheaded\\
260 - just thinking about somebody spending
$3,000.\\
261 - Oh, Ethel, can you come out right
away?\\
262 - Maybe Ricky won't be so mad if you're
here.\\
263 - Sure, honey, we'll get on a train\\
264 - just as soon as I can revive Fred.\\
265 - Oh, thank you so much and hurry,
hurry!\\
266 - Okay, we will. Bye.\\
267 - Fred? Fred?\\
268 - Fred, come on. Pull yourself
together.\\
269 - We got to go out to Connecticut.\\
270 - Three thousand dollars...\\
271 - Oh, good, Fred and Ethel.\\
272 - I forgot my key, honey...\\
273 - Hey! What's going on here?\\
274 - Hey, honey!\\
275 - Lucy!\\
276 - My foot's stuck!\\
277 - I know. I want to talk to you\\
278 - before I let you in.\\
279 - Now, listen, Ricky, I've done
something awful,\\
280 - and I want to tell my side of the
story\\
281 - such as it is,\\
282 - and then when you've had a chance to
calm down,\\
283 - I'll let you in.\\
284 - Now, listen, honey, now, listen.\\
285 - Uh... remember the other day\\
286 - when, when Betty Ramsey took me to
that wholesale house\\
287 - and you said that I could spend $500\\
288 - and when I came home, you asked me if
I spent it\\
289 - and I said "yes"?\\
290 - Well, honey, I...
I spent a little more.\\
291 - I didn't mean to, but, uh, I-I-I
thought\\
292 - that the price tags-- the tags were
price tags\\
293 - and they were really stock numbers,
see?\\
294 - And, well, honey...\\
295 - Now, honey, get a grip on yourself.\\
296 - I-I-I spent over $3,000.\\
297 - I didn't mean to, Ricky.
Really, I didn't.\\
298 - And I'm not going to let you in now\\
299 - until you promise to calm down, be
understanding\\
300 - and talk like a normal human being.\\
301 - Now, do you promise that, Ricky, do
you?\\
302 - Okay, I promise.\\
303 - Let me out!\\
304 - Lucy!\\
305 - You stay right where you are!\\
306 - Oh, now, honey, you promised\\
307 - to be calm and understanding.\\
308 - I am... I am calm,\\
309 - and I am very understanding.\\
310 - Now, we go in there.\\
311 - We go and sit down in there\\
312 - and-and we'll talk over this whole
thing\\
313 - like two normal human beings.\\
314 - Honey, isn't this pretty what we're
sitting on?\\
315 - See, I... I got both,\\
316 - because the room is so big\\
317 - and they match the two chairs and
everything.\\
318 - I bought this 'cause I like the
little railings\\
319 - and it spins; you can get things from
all sides.\\
320 - And the rug. Did you notice the
rug...\\
321 - Three thousand dollars!\\
322 - $3,272.65.\\
323 - How could you do such a thin'?!\\
324 - Well?\\
325 - Well, um...
I didn't mean to, but...\\
326 - Now, if you look at it another way,
dear,\\
327 - we really saved you money, you see,\\
328 - because Betty got them to take our
other furniture in on trade,\\
329 - and Betty got us a 40% discount.\\
330 - Betty.\\
331 - Yes, Betty.\\
332 - Do you remember I told you it wasn't
right\\
333 - to get too chummy with the neighbors
too fast?\\
334 - Oh, you're not gonna say, "I told you
so"?\\
335 - Yes, I am!\\
336 - Well, I just thought I'd ask.\\
337 - But, honey, I still say that Betty
did us a big favor.\\
338 - Uh, do you know how much money we're
saving?\\
339 - Yeah, exactly.\\
340 - We're saving $3,292.95.\\
341 - Well, now, why...\\
342 - Because all this stuff is going back!\\
343 - Oh, honey, I can't return all this.\\
344 - What'll I tell Betty Ramsey?\\
345 - Just tell her the truth-- that we
can't afford it.\\
346 - Oh, I couldn't tell her that.\\
347 - Why not?\\
348 - Why, I just couldn't, that's all.\\
349 - You, you, you tell her.\\
350 - You go on over and tell her you're a
tightwad.\\
351 - I'm a tightwad?\\
352 - Well, if the shoe fits...\\
353 - You go right over there,\\
354 - you go right over there this minute
and tell Betty.\\
355 - But Ricky...
Right this minute\\
356 - you go over there and tell her,\\
357 - I'll be upstairs.\\
358 - Honey?\\
359 - You, uh, you might notice a few new
things up there, too.\\
360 - Go on!\\
361 - Go on!\\
362 - Hi!
Hi!\\
363 - I'm going into town to pick up a few
things.\\
364 - Anything I can get for you?\\
365 - No, not another thing.\\
366 - I saw Ricky come home.\\
367 - What did he have to say when he saw
all the new things?\\
368 - Couldn't you hear him over at your
house?\\
369 - No. What do you mean?\\
370 - Well, as a matter of fact, Betty,\\
371 - I was just on my way over to talk to
you.\\
372 - I'm afraid we're going to have to
return all these things.\\
373 - Return them? Why?\\
374 - Well, we just can't...\\
375 - I don't think that, uh....\\
376 - Well...\\
377 - We... we just don't think we
should...\\
378 - We should look at some other
furniture\\
379 - before we plunge into buying all
this.\\
380 - Well, Lucy, you might at least have
told me this\\
381 - before we took up Mr. Perry's time\\
382 - and had everything sent out.\\
383 - Yeah, well...\\
384 - You know, Betty, now that I see all
this furniture here,\\
385 - I don't think it suits the house.\\
386 - Doesn't suit it?\\
387 - It's an early American house.\\
388 - This is early American furniture.\\
389 - That's just it, it's too pat.\\
390 - What?\\
391 - Well, you know what this house needs?\\
392 - What?\\
393 - Chinese modern.\\
394 - Yeah, low black tables and bamboo
mats\\
395 - and cushions thrown all around.\\
396 - We love to eat on the floor.\\
397 - And, and, and lanterns and screens\\
398 - and a built-in mah-jongg set.\\
399 - All right, Lucy, why don't you just
come right out and say it.\\
400 - Say what?\\
401 - You don't like my taste.\\
402 - Oh, no, Betty, I didn't mean that.
No.\\
403 - What else could it be?\\
404 - I'm only trying to be helpful.\\
405 - Well, that's what I get.\\
406 - My husband warned me not to get too
chummy\\
407 - with the new neighbors, and he was so
right. Huh!\\
408 - Oh, Betty, but I didn't say that. I
didn't mean that.\\
409 - You don't understand, Betty.\\
410 - Betty, listen...\\
411 - Oh, dear.\\
412 - Oh, dear.\\
413 - What's the matter?\\
414 - Betty Ramsey was just here.\\
415 - Oh. You tell her we couldn't afford
the furniture?\\
416 - Oh, I couldn't bring myself to tell
her we couldn't afford it,\\
417 - so now she thinks that we don't like
her taste\\
418 - and everything's a big mess.\\
419 - Oh, fine, leave it to two women to
get everything fouled up.\\
420 - All right, I'll go next door\\
421 - and have a man-to-man talk with her
husband\\
422 - and just tell him that we cannot
afford it, that's all.\\
423 - All right.\\
424 - And don't cry on that sofa--\\
425 - that's going back.\\
426 - Oh!\\
427 - Mr. Ramsey?
Yes.\\
428 - I'm Ricky Ricardo from next door.\\
429 - Our wives have already met.\\
430 - Oh, hi! Come on in.\\
431 - Thank you.\\
432 - Call me Ralph.\\
433 - Thank you.\\
434 - Let's go in the den where we can sit
down.\\
435 - Oh, uh, I haven't got much time.\\
436 - I just want to talk about something.\\
437 - Oh? I was telling the boys down at
the agency\\
438 - that I live next door to a big
celebrity now.\\
439 - Uh, what agency are you with?\\
440 - Burton, Warshman & Ramsey.\\
441 - Oh! Are you that Ramsey?\\
442 - Well, yes, I guess I am.\\
443 - Talking about you last week out at
the country club.\\
444 - You were?
Mm-hmm.\\
445 - Proposed your name to the membership
committee.\\
446 - No kidding.\\
447 - Yeah, of course the dues,\\
448 - the initiation fee are pretty high,\\
449 - but I told them that money doesn't
mean a thing\\
450 - to a big star like Ricky Ricardo.\\
451 - Yeah, well, uh...\\
452 - Oh, yeah!\\
453 - Yeah!\\
454 - Sure.\\
455 - Yesterday, down at our weekly Think
Conference at the agency,\\
456 - I suggested your name for a guest
shot on a TV show.\\
457 - You did?\\
458 - Yes, and the reaction was tremendous.\\
459 - Well, how nice.\\
460 - Are you interested?\\
461 - Why, sure, I'm always interested\\
462 - in doing guest spots.\\
463 - Oh, good, good.\\
464 - Uh, what was it you wanted to talk to
me about?\\
465 - Oh, well, I just wanted to talk to
you\\
466 - about the furniture that your wife
picked up.\\
467 - Oh, that's all right.\\
468 - You don't have to thank me.\\
469 - I was glad to set it up for you.
How do you like it?\\
470 - Fine, fine.
Only that, uh...\\
471 - Well, it's a little bit high...\\
472 - High-priced?\\
473 - No, no, no, it's not that; it's
just...\\
474 - high-class, you know.\\
475 - We, uh...\\
476 - We're very earthy people.\\
477 - You mean you don't like it?\\
478 - Oh, no, no, it's not that; it's fine.
It's just that...\\
479 - Well...\\
480 - it's not for us.\\
481 - What you mean is, it doesn't suit
you.\\
482 - Yes, that's it.\\
483 - In other words, you don't like my
wife's taste.\\
484 - Oh, no, I didn't say that.\\
485 - Well, that's what you were inferring.\\
486 - Well, no, I... I didn't infer, I
didn't.\\
487 - Well, I got you a wonderful discount,\\
488 - so it can't be the price.
What is it?\\
489 - We just want to return it, that's
all.\\
490 - Well, it's impossible.\\
491 - Why?\\
492 - Well, I went to a lot of trouble to
set up that deal.\\
493 - I can't ask those people to take it
back.\\
494 - Why not?\\
495 - Well, I just can't, that's all.\\
496 - Are you by any chance getting a
kickback\\
497 - from this furniture store?\\
498 - Now, look here, Mr. Ricardo,\\
499 - I don't have to stand here and be
insulted.\\
500 - First you don't like my wife's taste,\\
501 - now you call me a crook.\\
502 - I think you'd better get going.\\
503 - Are you throwing me out?\\
504 - I said, I think you'd better get
going.\\
505 - Who's going to make me?\\
506 - I am.\\
507 - You are?\\
508 - Mm.\\
509 - Hah!\\
510 - Would you care to step outside?\\
511 - I'd love to.\\
512 - So would I.\\
513 - Good.\\
514 - Good!\\
515 - And you can forget about that TV
show.\\
516 - We'll get Cugat.\\
517 - That does it.
Come on, let's go.\\
518 - Don't bother to knock.\\
519 - Just use your key, Fred.\\
520 - Hurry up. Hurry up, Fred.\\
521 - All right.\\
522 - Do you suppose we beat Ricky here?\\
523 - I guess so. There's nothing broken.\\
524 - My, Fred, isn't all this new
furniture beautiful?\\
525 - Beautiful it is.\\
526 - $3,000 worth it ain't.\\
527 - Oh, Fred.\\
528 - It's too quiet around here.\\
529 - I don't like it.\\
530 - Mira que cosa!\\
531 - Hi!\\
532 - Mira que cosa!\\
533 - Oh, my goodness!\\
534 - If he looks like that, what must Lucy
look like?\\
535 - Oh, Fred and Ethel, you're here!\\
536 - Not a scratch on her.\\
537 - Honey! What happened?\\
538 - Don't you know?\\
539 - No! Honey, what happened to you?\\
540 - Yo te voy a decir lo que ha pasado\\
541 - y que es esta senora y que es Ralph
Ramsey!\\
542 - What about Ralph Ramsey?\\
543 - Que nos pusimos en un peleado y me
empujo en un rosebush!\\
544 - What's he saying, Lucy?
What's he saying?\\
545 - Well, as near as I can tell,\\
546 - our next-door neighbor Ralph Ramsey\\
547 - pushed him into a rosebush.\\
548 - Why did he do a thing like that?\\
549 - Well, Ricky went over to tell Ralph
Ramsey--\\
550 - that's Betty's husband--\\
551 - that we couldn't afford all this
furniture,\\
552 - because when I told Betty we couldn't
afford it,\\
553 - she thought that I thought that she
had bad taste.\\
554 - What'd she say?\\
555 - I got it. Didn't you?\\
556 - No. I was doing better with his
Spanish.\\
557 - What happened to you?\\
558 - I had a fight with Bruce.\\
559 - You had a fight with Bruce!
What about?\\
560 - He said his daddy beat up my daddy.\\
561 - Is that so?!\\
562 - Honey, honey, now calm down.\\
563 - I'm not going to calm down!\\
564 - I'm going to...
Honey, honey...\\
565 - I thought people moved to the country\\
566 - for peace and quiet.\\
567 - Honey, we'll get cleaned up.\\
568 - Ricardo, I think you owe us an
apology!\\
569 - Look what your boy did to our boy!\\
570 - What do you mean I owe you an
apology?\\
571 - You owe us an apology!\\
572 - Look what your boy\\
573 - did to our boy!\\
574 - I'm not apologizing until you do!\\
575 - Well, I'm not apologizing until you
do.\\
576 - Well, you started the whole thing.\\
577 - I did not.
My wife did.\\
578 - I did?\\
579 - You inferred you didn't like my
taste.\\
580 - I did not.\\
581 - And you called me a crook.\\
582 - No, I did not...\\
583 - I didn't call you a crook.\\
584 - Fellas, keep quiet, please.\\
585 - Just give me a chance!\\
586 - Lucy...\\
587 - What?\\
588 - Aren't you going to introduce us?\\
589 - These are our friends, the Mertzes;\\
590 - our enemies, the Ramseys.\\
591 - You won't give me a chance!\\
592 - Oh, you fellas, quiet.\\
593 - This is all a big misunderstanding.\\
594 - The real reason for all this trouble
is\\
595 - that the Ricardos simply cannot
afford\\
596 - all this new furniture.\\
597 - Is that all?\\
598 - Why didn't you say so?\\
599 - Yeah, why didn't you say so?\\
600 - Yeah, why didn't you say so?\\
601 - Me? I'm just a little boy.\\
602 - Oh, Lucy...\\
603 - why didn't you tell me the truth?\\
604 - Well, I was too embarrassed to admit
it.\\
605 - Yeah, me, too.\\
606 - We would have understood.\\
607 - I've been wanting to redecorate our
house for years,\\
608 - but we just couldn't...\\
609 - Go ahead, honey, tell them.\\
610 - We couldn't afford it either.\\
611 - Hey, Bruce,\\
612 - how about being friends?\\
613 - Sure. Want to be mine?\\
614 - Sure. Let's go out and play.\\
615 - Aw...\\
616 - Lucy...\\
617 - I'm sorry.\\
618 - Sorry, pal.\\
619 - Had a nice workout, anyway.\\
620 - We sure did.\\
621 - Forget what I said about Cugat.\\
622 - If you want that job, it's yours.\\
623 - Well, thanks.
I'll take it.\\
624 - Hey, Lucy.
Yeah.\\
625 - Ralph is going to give me\\
626 - a television job in one of his shows.\\
627 - A guest appearance.\\
628 - A television job!
Yeah.\\
629 - Oh, boy, that's wonderful!\\
630 - Yeah.
It pays $3,500.\\
631 - $3,500?
Mm-hmm.\\
632 - $3,500!\\
633 - Honey, that'll just about, uh...\\
634 - Yeah, I know, pay for the new
furniture.\\
635 - Yeah.\\
636 - All right, all right.
\subsection {Episode 19: Lucy Raises Chickens (1957)}
1 - Bills, bills, bills!\\
2 - That's all there is in the mail this
morning.\\
3 - Lucy...\\
4 - I'm sorry, I bought it.
I didn't want it anyway,\\
5 - and I'll take it back tomorrow.\\
6 - No, no, no, honey, it's not you this
time.\\
7 - These are household bills.\\
8 - Oh, thank goodness.\\
9 - The house is gonna catch it for a
change.\\
10 - How can we spend so much money?\\
11 - heating bill-- $52,\\
12 - telephone-- $23,\\
13 - electric bill-- $18.75,\\
14 - water-- $16.\\
15 - How are we gonna pay all these bills?\\
16 - Well, now, honey,\\
17 - you don't have to pay them all at
once.\\
18 - Look... look, I got a system.\\
19 - See? We put them all\\
20 - in the lazy Susan like this, see?\\
21 - Just like that.\\
22 - Now, we spin it around\\
23 - and any bill that stays on gets paid.
See?\\
24 - The lucky winner\\
25 - is the Connecticut Light and Power
Company.\\
26 - Lucy, we can't pay our bills\\
27 - by spinning them around on a lousy
Susan.\\
28 - It's a lazy Susan.\\
29 - Well, whatever it is.\\
30 - How do you suggest we pay all the
unlucky losers?\\
31 - Well...\\
32 - What's this one here?\\
33 - Groceries-- $88!\\
34 - How can three people eat so much?\\
35 - It's five people.\\
36 - Don't forget the Mertzes have been
here every weekend,\\
37 - and you know how this country air
affects Ethel's appetite.\\
38 - Well, maybe this weekend\\
39 - you'd better tell Ethel to breathe a
little less.\\
40 - They're only gonna be here one day
this time,\\
41 - and, anyway, you know you love having
them.\\
42 - What's this?\\
43 - Tree surgery-- $50.\\
44 - Well, now, honey,\\
45 - you know how sick that poor elm was
outside\\
46 - It needed attention.\\
47 - I know, but $50?!\\
48 - I could have had my appendix taken
out.\\
49 - Oh, honey, now,\\
50 - you knew it was gonna cost more
living in the country.\\
51 - I didn't know it was gonna\\
52 - cost this much more.\\
53 - Well, I'll say one thing for those
bills.\\
54 - They've certainly taken your mind off
the $3,000 I paid\\
55 - for the furniture.\\
56 - Oh, I've forgotten all about that.\\
57 - Oh, me and my big mouth.\\
58 - You spent $3,000 for new furniture!\\
59 - Well, now, honey, it would have cost
a lot more\\
60 - if Betty Ramsey hadn't gotten us that
discount.\\
61 - That's another thing.
Oh...\\
62 - If Betty Ramsey hadn't taken you to
that wholesale house,\\
63 - you wouldn't have spent nearly as
much.\\
64 - Oh, me, I gotta have a talk with my
mouth.\\
65 - Wouldn't you know?\\
66 - Wouldn't you know that we would just
move right next door\\
67 - to somebody like Betty Ramsey?\\
68 - She's the nosiest,\\
69 - most meddling female that I have
ever...\\
70 - Oh, hi, Betty!
Hi, Betty!\\
71 - How are you, Betty?
Hi, Ricky.\\
72 - I'm sorry to barge in,\\
73 - but I've got the most wonderful news.\\
74 - What?
I just talked\\
75 - to this friend of mine who writes\\
76 - for House and Garden magazine,\\
77 - and I told her about your house.\\
78 - Well, she'd love to see it,\\
79 - and if she likes it,\\
80 - she's gonna do a whole spread of
pictures\\
81 - of your house in her magazine.\\
82 - Oh, Betty, how wonderful.\\
83 - Isn't that exciting, Ricky?\\
84 - Yeah, exciting.\\
85 - Oh-ho-ho, Ricky, and you were worried\\
86 - about Lucy spending all that money
for furniture.\\
87 - Yeah.\\
88 - Betty, I don't really have time to
talk to you about it\\
89 - but I think it's wonderful.\\
90 - That's really thrilling news, Betty.
Bye!\\
91 - Oh, just think, honey.\\
92 - Maybe we're gonna get a picture of
our home\\
93 - in House and Garden.\\
94 - Yeah, great, and that'll be another
expense.\\
95 - Now we'll have to buy 50 copies of
the magazine.\\
96 - Oh...\\
97 - Gee, honey,\\
98 - I guess you're right about it\\
99 - being more expensive living in the
country\\
100 - but it doesn't have to be.\\
101 - What do you mean?\\
102 - Well, we're not making the country
work for us.\\
103 - You know, we could raise things.\\
104 - You're right. First thing we gotta
raise is money\\
105 - to pay for these bills.\\
106 - No, now, I'm serious.\\
107 - A lot of people around here\\
108 - make extra money by farming.\\
109 - Now, we could have apple orchards\\
110 - and grape vineyards\\
111 - and maybe some grain and wheat fields
and...\\
112 - and a herd or two of cattle, maybe.\\
113 - Lucy, we only own two acres, you
know.\\
114 - What you're talking about\\
115 - would take the entire state of
Ay-oh-a-way.\\
116 - "Ay-oh-a-way"?\\
117 - Well, how do you think the state of
"Ay-oh-a-way" got started?\\
118 - Farming, huh?\\
119 - That's right.\\
120 - Well, maybe we could do a little
farming,\\
121 - but it's got to be on a small scale.\\
122 - Something small, now, something
small.\\
123 - Chickens!\\
124 - Let's raise chickens.\\
125 - What about corn?\\
126 - Why corn instead of chickens?\\
127 - Well, we'll sleep a lot better.\\
128 - Corn doesn't crow at 5:00 in the
morning.\\
129 - We'll make a lot more money raising
chickens.\\
130 - Yeah, how do you figure?\\
131 - Well, chickens lay eggs, right?\\
132 - I can't argue with you on that.\\
133 - And eggs are 75 cents a dozen.\\
134 - That's clear profit right there.\\
135 - Yeah, well, suppose the chickens stop
laying eggs?\\
136 - Once a chicken is all egged out, you
sell it for poultry.\\
137 - You can't lose.\\
138 - What about 'spenses?\\
139 - Oh, what "spenses" are there?\\
140 - Shelter and some food.\\
141 - What can a little grain and corn
cost?\\
142 - 50 cents a sack-- that's chicken
feed.\\
143 - Chicken feed.\\
144 - Well, when you stop cackling...\\
145 - who's gonna take care of all these
chickens?\\
146 - Well, what's there to take care of?\\
147 - As fast as they drop the eggs,\\
148 - we pick them up and put them in the
cartons.\\
149 - Well, it sounds good.\\
150 - Sure, it's a snap.\\
151 - And who knows, maybe later on\\
152 - we can train the chickens to lay the
eggs right in the cartons.\\
153 - You know, cut out the middle man.\\
154 - Well, honey, if the business folds,\\
155 - we can always eat the inventory.\\
156 - That's true.\\
157 - Sure.\\
158 - So we figure that by selling the
eggs,\\
159 - and marketing the chickens,\\
160 - we could make a nice piece of change.\\
161 - And it was all my idea.\\
162 - Yeah.\\
163 - What's the matter?\\
164 - Haven't you ever seen me eat before?\\
165 - I've never seen you do anything else.\\
166 - I don't see you going on any hunger
strike.\\
167 - Well, Fred, what do you think of our
little scheme?\\
168 - Well, it sounds pretty good,\\
169 - but you'd better hire somebody\\
170 - with experience to handle it for you.\\
171 - Well, if we gotta get somebody,\\
172 - then it's out of the question.\\
173 - We can't afford to hire a hand.\\
174 - We can't even afford to hire a
finger.\\
175 - You don't have to pay him a salary,
Rick.\\
176 - Let him work, give him a place to
live\\
177 - and cut him in for a share of the
profit.\\
178 - Oh, are there people who do that?\\
179 - Why, sure, we had a man who did just
that\\
180 - when I was a little boy on the farm.\\
181 - Huh. It's hard to believe Fred was
ever on a farm.\\
182 - It's hard to believe he was ever a
little boy.\\
183 - All right, you two, all right.\\
184 - You know, Fred, if we could get\\
185 - somebody like that, it might be worth
it.\\
186 - Yeah, it might be profitable for both
parties.\\
187 - Hey, if we got a chicken fellow,\\
188 - he could live in the guest house.\\
189 - Yeah. How do you go about getting
someone like that?\\
190 - Well, put an ad in the local paper.\\
191 - Yeah, that's a good idea.\\
192 - Now, let's see, what will we say?\\
193 - I had a pencil around here.
What happened to it?\\
194 - Maybe Ethel ate it.\\
195 - You write out the ad, Rick,\\
196 - and we'll drop it off at the
newspaper\\
197 - on our way to the station.\\
198 - Okay, now, let's see.\\
199 - How do we start it, Fred?\\
200 - Well, you gotta have a tricky heading
for the ad.\\
201 - Something that'll catch their eye.\\
202 - Uh-huh.\\
203 - I know. "Become a millionaire
overnight."\\
204 - That's a little bit too optimistic,
don't you think?\\
205 - How about "Get rich quick"?\\
206 - That's still too much.\\
207 - Why don't you just say\\
208 - "Want to pour your money down a rat
hole?"\\
209 - Now, honey, don't be silly.\\
210 - Besides, there's no money required.\\
211 - "No money
required."\\
212 - That'd sure catch my eye.\\
213 - "No money required." That's good.\\
214 - "No... money... required."\\
215 - Now, what else?\\
216 - Wanted...\\
217 - "Wanted." That's good.\\
218 - "'Sperienced chicken farmer."\\
219 - How do you spell 'sperience?\\
220 - E-x-p...\\
221 - "E-x", you're kidding?\\
222 - E-x-p-e-r...\\
223 - What do you know?
E-x-p...\\
224 - Honey, we got some answers to our ad.\\
225 - Oh, any good ones?\\
226 - Well, this sounds pretty good,\\
227 - but he's got 12 children.\\
228 - There's no place to put them all.\\
229 - Well, don't throw away his address.\\
230 - He sounds like a great customer for
our eggs.\\
231 - Here's a kid who's going to
agricultural college.\\
232 - Oh, he sounds good.\\
233 - Well, he's not for us, though.\\
234 - He's a sophomore,\\
235 - and he wants us to hold the job open
until he graduates.\\
236 - Oh, no.\\
237 - Here's one I haven't seen yet.\\
238 - Let's see.\\
239 - "In answer to your ad,\\
240 - "I present the following
qualifications.\\
241 - "I was born and raised on a farm in
the Midwest,\\
242 - "and I'm very familiar with chickens.\\
243 - "I am an industrious, intelligent and
reliable veteran\\
244 - of World War I."\\
245 - Oh, he's an old codger.\\
246 - "Although my wife and I live in the
city,\\
247 - "we're most anxious to return to the
simple life.\\
248 - "Having been in show business\\
249 - "for a long while, I feel especially
qualified\\
250 - "for this position\\
251 - since over the years, I have laid
many an egg myself."\\
252 - He's got a good sense of humor.
Yeah.\\
253 - "If you're interested, just open your
front door.\\
254 - "My wife and I are waiting\\
255 - "on the porch.\\
256 - Sincerely yours, Fred H. Mertz."\\
257 - Oh, no!\\
258 - Are they kidding?\\
259 - Oh!
Fred and Ethel!\\
260 - I don't believe it.\\
261 - What is this?\\
262 - I hear you're looking for a good
hired hand.\\
263 - We almost froze hiding out there.\\
264 - We thought you'd never come out for
the mail.\\
265 - Oh, honestly.\\
266 - You mean, this whole thing isn't a
joke?\\
267 - We were never more serious in our
lives.\\
268 - We've been talking about it\\
269 - ever since we left here Saturday.\\
270 - Just made the decision this morning.\\
271 - This morning? Well, how'd your letter
get here so fast?\\
272 - We brought it up with us on the train\\
273 - and stuck it in your mailbox.\\
274 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
275 - Didn't you notice the stamp?\\
276 - No.
No.\\
277 - An Easter seal.\\
278 - You don't think Fred'd waste three
cents?\\
279 - Oh, honey!\\
280 - Oh, come on in!\\
281 - I was afraid you'd catch onto it.\\
282 - Oh, I never had an idea.\\
283 - Ah, what a nice surprise!\\
284 - Glad to be here.\\
285 - Gosh, imagine you two applying for
the job.\\
286 - Why, we never thought of you.\\
287 - No.\\
288 - We never thought of us either\\
289 - until after we got to town.\\
290 - We've been talking about it ever
since.\\
291 - Fred was so excited, he couldn't
sleep.\\
292 - I can top that.\\
293 - Ethel was so excited, she couldn't
eat.\\
294 - Oh, honey, I just think this is
marvelous.\\
295 - And best of all, if you give us the
job,\\
296 - we'll be near you again.\\
297 - Of course you've got the job.\\
298 - Fred, do you really know anything
about chickens?\\
299 - Well, for the past 25 years, I've
been henpecked.\\
300 - Remember, Rick, I told you I was
raised on a farm.\\
301 - Well, partner, you got yourself a
job.\\
302 - We're in the chicken business
together.\\
303 - Fine.\\
304 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
305 - Hey, what about your apartment?\\
306 - Mrs. Trumbull's sister wants to move
in\\
307 - and manage the building for us.\\
308 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
309 - She'll move in anytime we give her
the high sign.\\
310 - Well, that's just wonderful.\\
311 - Then it's all settled, huh?\\
312 - Lucy, Lucy...
What?\\
313 - Well, now, we can't move into the
guest house\\
314 - until all of our stuff gets here.\\
315 - Oh, honey, you can stay\\
316 - in our spare room upstairs.\\
317 - Oh, good, fine.
Sure.\\
318 - Well, look, we can start in the
chicken business right away.\\
319 - Let's see now.
What do we want first?\\
320 - Baby chicks.\\
321 - Hold it, Lucy. Hold it.\\
322 - We got a lot of fixing up to do in
that henhouse.\\
323 - I gotta paint, plaster, put up
chicken wire.\\
324 - That'll take at least a week.\\
325 - A week?
Yes.\\
326 - Oh, my. Well, if we're gonna live
with you for a week,\\
327 - before we can go into business
together,\\
328 - we want to pay you rent.\\
329 - Oh, Ethel, no.\\
330 - No, that's out of the question.\\
331 - I'll say it is.\\
332 - Fred, we are paying rent.\\
333 - Oh, for corn's sake.\\
334 - What's so funny?\\
335 - I was just thinking,\\
336 - after all these years,\\
337 - I'm going to be Fred's landlord.\\
338 - Well, I hope you'll be a good one,
Rick.\\
339 - Well, I'll try to be\\
340 - as good a landlord as you were.\\
341 - Uh-oh, we're in trouble.\\
342 - Oh-ho-ho!\\
343 - Brrrr!\\
344 - Yoo-hoo!\\
345 - Anybody home?\\
346 - Just the hired hand, ma'am.\\
347 - Hi.
Oh, hi, Fred.\\
348 - Where's Little Ricky?\\
349 - He's next door, playing with the
Ramsey kid.\\
350 - Oh.
What have you been doing, Fred?\\
351 - Plastering the cracks in the henhouse
all afternoon\\
352 - that you were supposed to help me
with.\\
353 - That's what I've been doing, Fred.\\
354 - The hired help seems to be getting
nastier all the time.\\
355 - What have you been doing?\\
356 - Well, we...\\
357 - You tell him, Lucy.\\
358 - Okay. Well, as you know, Fred,\\
359 - we went into the village to do a
little shopping\\
360 - and we just happened to pass the
hatchery\\
361 - and we went in to browse.\\
362 - Well, we just couldn't resist.\\
363 - Fred, you and Ethel are now the proud
parents\\
364 - of 500 baby chicks!\\
365 - Congratulations, you old rooster.\\
366 - The same to you, you old hen.\\
367 - We can have them delivered next week\\
368 - when the henhouse is ready.\\
369 - Oh, the henhouse is fine,\\
370 - and after all, chickens aren't fussy.\\
371 - Yeah, we were just down there.\\
372 - And your little family seems to love
it.\\
373 - Holy mackerel!\\
374 - Do you mean to tell me\\
375 - that you put 500 baby chicks in that
henhouse?\\
376 - Yeah. Why not?\\
377 - Are you crazy?\\
378 - In this cold weather, they'll freeze
their fuzz off.\\
379 - Well, Fred, they're all in boxes.\\
380 - Oh... but they gotta be kept warm.\\
381 - Now you phone that hatchery\\
382 - and tell them to send two brooders
over here right away.\\
383 - Two brooders?
Yes. Right away.\\
384 - Come on now, you help me bring those
chickens in here\\
385 - so they'll stay warm.\\
386 - Oh, I will, I will.\\
387 - I never heard of such a thing.\\
388 - Freeze their fuzz off?\\
389 - Okay!\\
390 - Okay, Fred, careful on the step.\\
391 - Yeah.\\
392 - Take off the feed, Lucy.\\
393 - Take the feed.\\
394 - Gee, it is cold out there.
Whew!\\
395 - Did you phone the hatchery?\\
396 - Oh, yes, Fred, I did,\\
397 - but they were already closed.\\
398 - Oh, my! What'll we do with them,
Fred?\\
399 - We'll keep them in the house till
tomorrow.\\
400 - Oh, it's a good thing we got this
feed.\\
401 - Uh, where shall we put them?\\
402 - What's the warmest room in the house?\\
403 - Well, the den, I guess.\\
404 - It's right over the furnace.\\
405 - Well, open the vents in the den\\
406 - and turn the heat up to 90.\\
407 - Ninety?\\
408 - Yes, ninety.\\
409 - We want to raise chickens, not roast
them.\\
410 - Baby chicks have to have a
temperature of 90 degrees.\\
411 - Now, don't stand there and argue.\\
412 - Turn up the heat.\\
413 - All right!
All right.\\
414 - Oh, my, that's the first time in his
life\\
415 - Fred's ever said, "Turn up the heat."\\
416 - You never did this for me.\\
417 - You're no chicken, Ethel.\\
418 - Where's a good place?\\
419 - Right here.
right here, Fred.\\
420 - Oh, oh...
Ooh, ooh...\\
421 - Push it over a little bit.\\
422 - Oh, boy.\\
423 - Whew!\\
424 - Hey, let's take the boxes...\\
425 - the covers off the boxes.\\
426 - I'll bet it's very stuffy in here.\\
427 - I'll go and check the furnace.\\
428 - We gotta keep these chickens warm.\\
429 - Okay.\\
430 - Oh, aren't they the cutest little
things you ever saw?\\
431 - Oh, God love them.\\
432 - Aren't they funny?\\
433 - Hello, you little darlings.\\
434 - Oh, my goodness.\\
435 - Look at those little things.\\
436 - Hello, lovie.\\
437 - They're so soft and sweet.\\
438 - You can hardly feel one in your
hands.\\
439 - Hey, listen.\\
440 - They're talking about Fred.\\
441 - They're talking about Fred?\\
442 - Yeah, they're saying, "cheap, cheap,
cheap."\\
443 - Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello!\\
444 - Gee, I bet they're hungry.\\
445 - Let's feed them.\\
446 - Okay.\\
447 - I'll push this back.\\
448 - You stay in those boxes till I get
ready for you.\\
449 - Lucy, what are you doing?\\
450 - I'm setting the table for their
dinner.\\
451 - Don't you just leave them in the
boxes?\\
452 - No, it's too cramped in there.\\
453 - They gotta have elbow room.\\
454 - You're gonna let them out?\\
455 - Yeah, we'll put them all down here.
Sure.\\
456 - Oh, well, I'll get mine out, huh?\\
457 - Yeah.
Come on, honey.\\
458 - Come on, honey.\\
459 - Come on.
Come and get it!\\
460 - Come on, honey.\\
461 - Oh, you're gonna have some food.\\
462 - Come and get it.\\
463 - Isn't this fun?\\
464 - Come on.\\
465 - Here you go.\\
466 - Get out there.\\
467 - Wow-dee-oh!\\
468 - Wow-dee-yow-dee!\\
469 - Here you go!\\
470 - Get out from underneath there.\\
471 - Come on there, fellas.\\
472 - Here you go.
Come on.\\
473 - Here you are. Get out.\\
474 - Right over there.
Right over there.\\
475 - Here you are, get out.\\
476 - Go, go, go.\\
477 - Oh, my.\\
478 - Come and get it!\\
479 - Over here, come on, fellows.\\
480 - Over here, over here, over here.\\
481 - Come on.
Come on.\\
482 - Here you are.\\
483 - Here you are.\\
484 - Oh, careful, Fred, careful.\\
485 - Careful!
Oh, come on.\\
486 - Goodness sakes, why'd you let them
out?\\
487 - So they'd have room to eat.\\
488 - It's crowded in those boxes.\\
489 - Well, I guess it'll be all right for
a few minutes.\\
490 - It's hot in here now.\\
491 - Yeah.
Oh, boy, I'll say it is.\\
492 - Say, watching them eat has made me
kind of hungry.\\
493 - Let's have a little snack, Lucy?\\
494 - Okay, good idea.\\
495 - Not till you put\\
496 - those chickens back in their boxes.\\
497 - Oh, no, Fred, let them eat.\\
498 - We'll put them back in after we
finish.\\
499 - Good-bye.
Come on, fellas.\\
500 - Enjoy your dinner.\\
501 - Have a good time.\\
502 - There you go, over there. Over there.\\
503 - Oh, brother.\\
504 - Wall-to-wall chickens!\\
505 - Oh, boy, it was hot in there.\\
506 - I'll say.\\
507 - Gee, I don't want to be around\\
508 - when Ricky finds 500 chickens in the
den.\\
509 - I'll tell you one thing.\\
510 - He's gonna be plenty miserable\\
511 - when he starts reading his newspaper.\\
512 - What do you want to eat, Ethel?\\
513 - Oh, just something to nibble on.\\
514 - How about a chicken leg?\\
515 - Shh, Ethel!\\
516 - Oh, I hope they didn't hear you.\\
517 - I'm sorry, honey.\\
518 - My gosh.\\
519 - Most chicken farmers only have foxes
to worry about.\\
520 - We got Ethel, too.\\
521 - Mommy!\\
522 - Oh, boy!\\
523 - Boy, those chicks are noisy little
fellows, aren't they?\\
524 - Yeah, they have strong lungs.\\
525 - You can hear them all the way from
the den.\\
526 - If I didn't know,\\
527 - I'd swear they were right in the next
room.\\
528 - Mommy, look!\\
529 - Oh, hi, sweetheart.\\
530 - Oh, yeah, you found them.\\
531 - Isn't that the sweetest thing?\\
532 - Did you close the den door, dear?\\
533 - I don't remember.\\
534 - You don't remember?\\
535 - Oh, Lucy!\\
536 - Oh, no!\\
537 - Oh, my gosh.\\
538 - Oh, no wonder they sounded like\\
539 - they were right in the next room.\\
540 - Quick, open the vents and let in more
heat.\\
541 - Hurry.
Oh, my....\\
542 - Oh, fellas, fellas, come on
now.\\
543 - Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.\\
544 - Back to the den.\\
545 - Oh, dear!\\
546 - Come on, fellas.\\
547 - Come on.
Back, back, back.\\
548 - Back to the den.
Back to the den.\\
549 - To the rear march!
To the rear march!\\
550 - Oh, come on, fellas.\\
551 - Come on, now. Come on, come on, come
on, come on.\\
552 - Come on, come on.\\
553 - Fred, what'll we do?\\
554 - You were raised on a farm.\\
555 - I don't know.\\
556 - We were kind of funny farmers.\\
557 - We kept our chickens in the henhouse.\\
558 - Come on now.\\
559 - 431...
432... 433.\\
560 - Now, let's see.\\
561 - Oh, Ethel, we're still missing 67
chicks.\\
562 - Oh... well, where would you go if you
were 67 chicks?\\
563 - Anywhere to get out of this 90-degree
heat.\\
564 - They gotta be around here somewhere.\\
565 - Chick, chick, chick, chick, chick.\\
566 - Come on, come on, chickens.\\
567 - Chick, chick, chick, chick, chick,
chick.\\
568 - Oh, where's Fred?\\
569 - He's making us some lemonade.\\
570 - Oh, good for him.\\
571 - Chick, chick, chick, chick...\\
572 - Chicky-chicky-chicky, chick, chick,
chick!\\
573 - Come on. Chicky, chicky, chicky!\\
574 - Oh...\\
575 - 65-- I just found two more.\\
576 - Come on out of...
Come on! Come on!\\
577 - All right. Come and get it!\\
578 - Cool and refreshing.\\
579 - There you are.\\
580 - Oh! Oh!\\
581 - I know, I know.\\
582 - Oh, boy, that just hits the spot!\\
583 - Oh, I'll say it does.\\
584 - It's like a steam bath in here.\\
585 - What's the latest count?\\
586 - 65 still at large.\\
587 - Any suggestions?\\
588 - Yeah. Let's wait till they grow up.\\
589 - They'll be easier to find.\\
590 - Hello?\\
591 - Oh, we're in here, honey.\\
592 - Hey, it's hot in here.\\
593 - Yeah.\\
594 - Why, it's over 90.\\
595 - Don't touch that thermostat!\\
596 - What's the matter?\\
597 - What's going on?
What's all this?\\
598 - Why is the heat up so high?\\
599 - Why are you dressed up like that?\\
600 - What questions do you want me to
answer:\\
601 - "What's going on?
What's all this?"\\
602 - "Why is the heat up so high?"\\
603 - Or "why are we dressed like this?"\\
604 - Answer them all.\\
605 - Okay.\\
606 - Boy, it's hot!\\
607 - These are baby chicks\\
608 - and the heat's up so high so they
won't freeze.\\
609 - We're dressed like this so we won't
roast,\\
610 - and this is all going on\\
611 - 'cause Little Ricky left the door to
the den open,\\
612 - and would you care for some lemonade?\\
613 - Well, I like to think that I got into
the wrong house,\\
614 - but I know I didn't.\\
615 - No, you didn't.\\
616 - Well, Rick, you see,\\
617 - Lucy and I bought 500 baby chicks.\\
618 - Yeah. Aren't they cute, honey?\\
619 - Adorable, but what are they doing
here?\\
620 - Well, we had to bring them into the
house\\
621 - because these two dumb Doras\\
622 - didn't know that you have to keep
baby chicks in brooders.\\
623 - Why, anybody knows\\
624 - that you have to keep baby chicks in
a brooder.\\
625 - What's a brooder?\\
626 - It's a contraption to keep them warm.\\
627 - Oh, well, come on.\\
628 - Let's get them out of here, put them
in the den\\
629 - and let's cool off the rest of the
house.\\
630 - We can't.
Why not?\\
631 - Because, sir, 65 of our chickens are
missing\\
632 - Well, I can't stand this heat any
longer.\\
633 - Well, now, Rick, we gotta keep it
this hot\\
634 - until we find the missing chicks.\\
635 - All right, come on, let's find them.\\
636 - Oh, we've been looking, Ricky.\\
637 - Pollito, pollito, pollito, aqui,
aqui, pollito!\\
638 - Pollito!
Pollito!\\
639 - Ricky, in English.\\
640 - In English.
Oh....\\
641 - Chick, chick, chick, chick,\\
642 - chick, chick, chick, chick!\\
643 - Chicky!\\
644 - Boy, it's hot in here.\\
645 - Hey, there's a bunch of them\\
646 - out here under the clothes dryer!\\
647 - Well, get them out of there.\\
648 - Oh, I can't reach them.\\
649 - They're all huddled up against the
wall.\\
650 - I'll help you.\\
651 - Chicky, come on.\\
652 - Chicky!\\
653 - Come on, chick.
Chick, chick, chick!\\
654 - Are you getting them?\\
655 - No, I can't reach them either.\\
656 - Well, you need any help?\\
657 - No. I got an idea.\\
658 - I think I'll pretend I'm their
mother.\\
659 - Maybe they'll follow me.\\
660 - Hey, she's getting them.\\
661 - Over here, honey.
Over here, honey.\\
662 - That's it.
That's it.\\
663 - Hi, Betty.\\
664 - Lucy, these are the people\\
665 - from House and Garden magazine.\\
666 - I don't think so.\\
667 - Oh, dear, no.\\
668 - I'll call you later, Lucy.\\
669 - Oh, dear!\\
670 - Now we'll never get our picture in
House and Garden.\\
671 - That's all right, honey. Don't worry.\\
672 - Maybe we'll make the next issue of
Chicken Breeders' Gazette.\\
673 - Oh...\\
674 - Come on.
Come on.\\
675 - Come on.
Come on.
\subsection {Episode 20: Lucy Does The Tango (1957)}
1 - What's the matter?\\
2 - You are not cooperating.\\
3 - When you dance the tango\\
4 - you should have a sultry look.\\
5 - A sultry look?
What do you mean?\\
6 - Like this.\\
7 - Well, I don't think we should look
that sultry.\\
8 - Why not?\\
9 - Look, honey, we're doing this dance
for Little Ricky's P.T.A.\\
10 - We don't want to have the school
raided.\\
11 - You don't have to overdo it.\\
12 - Just look interested.\\
13 - You know, breathe heavily or
something.\\
14 - Breathe heavily?\\
15 - Well, you know.\\
16 - Oh, not that heavily.\\
17 - Hi.\\
18 - Hi.\\
19 - Hi, Ethel.\\
20 - What are you doing?\\
21 - We're dancing, what do you think?\\
22 - Oh.\\
23 - Ricky and I are going to tango for
the P.T.A.\\
24 - a week from Saturday.\\
25 - Oh.\\
26 - Now, look, honey...\\
27 - What?\\
28 - Do we have to dance?\\
29 - Couldn't we just take tickets or sell
popcorn\\
30 - or scrape the gum from underneath the
chairs\\
31 - after the show or something?\\
32 - Now, honey, I promised them that we
would perform.\\
33 - I know, but I just don't want to lay
an egg, that's all.\\
34 - Hey, speaking of that, look.\\
35 - Ethel, you mean our chickens are
starting to lay?\\
36 - Oh, no, not yet,\\
37 - but I thought we ought to be ready\\
38 - to get right down to business\\
39 - the minute that first egg rolls off
the assembly line.\\
40 - Fred says that they should start
laying\\
41 - when they're six weeks old.\\
42 - Gee, just think, 500 chickens.\\
43 - And, if they're conscientious,\\
44 - we'll have 500 eggs a day to sell.\\
45 - We'll be rich.\\
46 - Smartest thing we ever did.\\
47 - Let's see, 500 eggs a day at 60 cents
a dozen... Let's see....\\
48 - Oh, now, don't bother.\\
49 - Fred's got it figured out to the last
penny.\\
50 - Oh, I'll bet he has.\\
51 - Say, by the way, where is our
vice-president\\
52 - in charge of chickens?\\
53 - He went over to Corwyn's Hatchery to
pick up\\
54 - some egg crates and some more feed.\\
55 - More feed?\\
56 - Yep. Fred says you got to\\
57 - put something into chickens\\
58 - if you want to get something out of
them.\\
59 - Well, he's right.\\
60 - Honey, let's try the finish again,
huh?\\
61 - All right.\\
62 - Hey, look at this, see what you
think, will you?\\
63 - All right.
We're going to do a dance.\\
64 - Okay?
Fine.\\
65 - Gee, you look just like\\
66 - Vilma Banky and Rudolph Valentino.\\
67 - Yeah, well...\\
68 - It's a little rough yet; needs some
practice.\\
69 - Yeah, a little bit.\\
70 - Hi.\\
71 - Oh, hi, Fred, you're back.\\
72 - Hello, Fred.
How are you?\\
73 - Did you get the egg crates and the
feed?\\
74 - Well, I got the feed, but no egg
crates.\\
75 - Why not?\\
76 - Well, I don't know just how to tell
you this, Rick.\\
77 - Tell me what?\\
78 - Well, you remember, I told you the
chickens\\
79 - started to lay when they were six
weeks old?\\
80 - Yeah?\\
81 - I made a slight miscalculation.\\
82 - Mr. Corwyn tells me it's six months.\\
83 - What?\\
84 - Oh, brother.\\
85 - No wonder those little chicks looked
so wild-eyed\\
86 - when I put them on the nest and said,
"Come on, give."\\
87 - I thought you were raised on a farm\\
88 - and you knew all about chickens.\\
89 - So I made one little mistake.\\
90 - One little mistake, he says.\\
91 - You know, that one little mistake of
yours,\\
92 - puts me in a bad spot.\\
93 - I was depending on the money from the
eggs\\
94 - to help pay the expenses around here.\\
95 - Yeah, I know, Rick, and I'm sure
sorry.\\
96 - It doesn't make me want to jump for
joy, either.\\
97 - Oh, brother.\\
98 - Well, listen, partner, this puts a
whole new light\\
99 - on our business arrangement.\\
100 - What do you mean?\\
101 - Well, I mean, we were going to share
the profit\\
102 - from selling the eggs, right?\\
103 - Right.\\
104 - In return I was gonna do\\
105 - all the work around here for nothing,
right?\\
106 - Right.\\
107 - Well, now there won't be any profits.\\
108 - So until the chickens start laying\\
109 - I think you ought to pay me a salary,
right?\\
110 - Wrong.\\
111 - How do you figure?\\
112 - Well, now, look, Fred.\\
113 - I'm not making any money out of the
eggs.\\
114 - In the meantime, you're living in the
guest house for nothing,\\
115 - so until the chickens start laying,\\
116 - I figure you should pay me rent.\\
117 - Rent?!\\
118 - Yeah, you know, that little thing
that I used to pay you\\
119 - the first of every month for 16
years?\\
120 - Now, look...\\
121 - Now, wait, you two, don't get into a
snit.\\
122 - Now just maybe we don't have to wait
so long\\
123 - to have some profits.\\
124 - What are you talking about?\\
125 - Well, why couldn't we trade in those
baby chicks\\
126 - for some full-grown hens\\
127 - that would start laying eggs right
away?\\
128 - Yeah, that way you'd have your
profits\\
129 - and you'd have your income.\\
130 - Now we're getting someplace.\\
131 - I've got to hand it to you, Lucy.\\
132 - Yeah, honey, that's a good idea.\\
133 - Yeah, I've done it again.\\
134 - Again?
Again?\\
135 - Don't knock it, just be glad I did it
this once.\\
136 - Look, Fred, let's go over to the
hatchery,\\
137 - and see what kind of a deal we can
make with that fellow.
Right.\\
138 - Let's go out and say good-bye to our
baby chicks.\\
139 - Oh, yes, that's a great idea.
Isn't that a good idea?\\
140 - There's nothing like growing your own
breakfast, huh, Ethel?\\
141 - Mm, boy, I'll say, these are so
fresh.\\
142 - Mommy, did our chickens lay these
eggs?\\
143 - Yes, dear.\\
144 - Our nice, new, big chickens.\\
145 - Now, what's the matter now?\\
146 - I tell you what's the matter!\\
147 - Fred botched it again.\\
148 - What are you talking about?\\
149 - You told me that each one of those
hens\\
150 - was supposed to lay one egg every
day.\\
151 - Right?\\
152 - Well, they've been here for a whole
week\\
153 - and all we've gotten is six lousy
eggs.\\
154 - What do you expect me to do, squeeze
the eggs out of them?\\
155 - Well, you're the expert, do
something.\\
156 - I've done everything but jump up and
sit in the nest with them.\\
157 - Oh, now, honey, don't get all upset.\\
158 - Maybe the reason the chickens aren't
laying\\
159 - is because they're nervous.\\
160 - Nervous? What have they got to be
nervous about?\\
161 - Wouldn't you be nervous if someone
was standing around\\
162 - waiting for you to lay an egg?\\
163 - Yeah, Rick, it's their new
surroundings.\\
164 - As soon as they get to feeling at
home,\\
165 - I bet they'll drop eggs\\
166 - so fast we'll have to jump out of the
way.\\
167 - She's right, Rick.\\
168 - I hope they start feeling at home
soon.\\
169 - Well, anyway, we're getting\\
170 - our breakfast for nothing.\\
171 - For nothing?\\
172 - Listen, with the cost of the feed,\\
173 - the money that I spent fixing the
henhouse,\\
174 - the extra heat and electricity\\
175 - and the money lost by switching\\
176 - the 500 baby chickens for the 200
hens,\\
177 - I figured out each one of those
breakfasts\\
178 - is costing $18 apiece.\\
179 - Eww.\\
180 - Yeah, "eww."\\
181 - Listen, I'll tell you what I'm going
to do.\\
182 - I'm going to give those hens one more
day.\\
183 - Now, if by tomorrow they don't start
laying regularly\\
184 - I'm gonna sell the whole bunch of
them\\
185 - and get out of the egg business.\\
186 - I can take a hint.\\
187 - Come on, Ethel, let's start packing.\\
188 - Oh, now, Fred...
Oh, now, Fred...\\
189 - Hold on, you got one more day.\\
190 - Yeah, now, Fred, instead of packing,\\
191 - maybe you'd better get out there\\
192 - to that chicken house\\
193 - and give those hens a pep talk.\\
194 - Yeah, why don't you try scaring them?\\
195 - Walk through the hen house with a
sign that says:\\
196 - "Fryers for sale."\\
197 - Sure, sure.\\
198 - Well...\\
199 - I'll help him.\\
200 - Yeah, you go help Uncle Fred, huh?\\
201 - Chickens.\\
202 - I should have raised something I knew
about, like sugar cane.\\
203 - Oh, dear.\\
204 - Oh, Lucy, this is awful.\\
205 - The boys at each other's throats,\\
206 - the chickens aren't cooperating.\\
207 - What are we going to do?\\
208 - I don't know, but don't give up, we
got one more day.\\
209 - You don't expect those hens\\
210 - to lay a bumper crop of eggs
overnight?\\
211 - You know, they could if we helped
them.\\
212 - Lucy, I've never laid an egg in my
life\\
213 - and I refuse to start trying now.\\
214 - No, I don't mean that,\\
215 - I mean buy some, maybe about five
dozen.\\
216 - Take them out to the henhouse, put
them in the nest,\\
217 - and let Fred and Ricky discover them.\\
218 - What good would that do?\\
219 - It'll only delay the inevitable one
more day.\\
220 - Well, in the meantime maybe our hens
will warm up\\
221 - and our men will cool down.\\
222 - It's worth a try.\\
223 - Well, so far, so good.\\
224 - Where's Ricky?\\
225 - He went into New York.
How about Fred?\\
226 - He's taking a nap.\\
227 - How do you know that?\\
228 - It's after lunch and before dinner.\\
229 - What else would he be doing?\\
230 - I guess you're right.\\
231 - Well, get your eggs and let's get out
there.\\
232 - All righty.\\
233 - Uh-oh.\\
234 - What's the matter?\\
235 - Your sleeping prince, he's out by the
henhouse chopping wood.\\
236 - He's supposed to be taking a nap.\\
237 - Can't he ever do anything right?\\
238 - Well, now what will we do?\\
239 - We'll just have to wait till he
finishes chopping wood.\\
240 - He'll probably be out there all
afternoon.\\
241 - We got to get these in the nest
before Ricky comes home.\\
242 - Well, what'll we do?\\
243 - We'll just have to stash them on us
someplace\\
244 - and just walk casually by Fred.\\
245 - We can't stash away five dozen eggs.\\
246 - Well, we can give it a try.
Here, open them up.\\
247 - What are you going to do?\\
248 - Well, I'm going to put some in my
blouse.\\
249 - I can get some in my hip pockets,
too.\\
250 - Be careful.\\
251 - Want me to help you?\\
252 - No, let's see, now.\\
253 - Ooh, you have to be awful careful.\\
254 - Yeah, this...\\
255 - Oh, oh...\\
256 - What's the matter?\\
257 - Whoo, they're cold.\\
258 - I wonder how the chicken stands it.\\
259 - Hey, I can get a dozen in one pocket.\\
260 - Yeah, I'm doing all right, too.\\
261 - Don't break them, don't break them,
be careful.\\
262 - No, just sounded like it.\\
263 - Just precious.\\
264 - We'll make it.\\
265 - Three dozen?\\
266 - I haven't broken one yet.\\
267 - How do I look?\\
268 - Oh, you look kind of lumpy.\\
269 - Maybe I better put my jacket on.\\
270 - Yeah, want me to help you?\\
271 - I can do it.\\
272 - I'll help you, honey.\\
273 - Wait a minute, I got one more egg to
go.\\
274 - Now, how's that?\\
275 - Oh, that looks fine.\\
276 - How do I look?\\
277 - Well, whatever you do\\
278 - don't try to walk like Marilyn
Monroe.\\
279 - Oh, we got to get rid of these
cartons.\\
280 - Put them all in here\\
281 - and I'll put them away there in the
firebox.\\
282 - I'll get it, I'll get it.\\
283 - Want me to help you?\\
284 - Easy, now, I can't...\\
285 - Lucy.\\
286 - Hi, honey.\\
287 - Why, I thought you were in New York.\\
288 - Well, I decided to take the late
train\\
289 - because I want to rehearse our
number.\\
290 - Rehearse?\\
291 - Oh, the act's just fine, honey.\\
292 - We don't want to get over-rehearsed.\\
293 - Well, I wouldn't worry about that if
I were you.\\
294 - Come on, I haven't got much time,
it's either now or never.\\
295 - Well, then make it never?\\
296 - Look, honey, if we're going to do the
dance\\
297 - in front of all those people\\
298 - I want to do it right.\\
299 - Now come in and rehearse.\\
300 - Well, I guess you won't be needing
me, Lucy. So long!\\
301 - Now, Ethel...
Huh?\\
302 - Wait a minute.\\
303 - Stick around, I want you to see--\\
304 - you know, tell us what it looks like.\\
305 - Come on, come on.\\
306 - Come on, honey.\\
307 - What's the matter?\\
308 - Honey, if we're gonna dance for the
P.T.A.,\\
309 - we should be dignified.\\
310 - We should stand at least two feet
apart.\\
311 - To tango?\\
312 - Yeah, well, you were right.\\
313 - We don't want to get the school
raided.\\
314 - Come on, honey, if we're going to
tango, let's tango, eh?\\
315 - Lucy!\\
316 - That's enough, honey...\\
317 - Come on, I want to do the finish.\\
318 - The finish?\\
319 - Yeah.\\
320 - Look, Lucy...\\
321 - I know that this is a ridiculous
question...\\
322 - What were you doing with eggs under
your shirt?\\
323 - Trying to hatch them?\\
324 - Lucy...\\
325 - Well, Ethel and I were trying to
sneak\\
326 - some eggs out into the henhouse\\
327 - you know, just to give the hens the
idea\\
328 - so that you and Fred wouldn't be mad
at each other anymore.\\
329 - Ethel!\\
330 - Are you carrying eggs?\\
331 - I was.\\
332 - I'm sorry, Ethel.\\
333 - You're sorry.\\
334 - All right, that does it.\\
335 - Tomorrow morning\\
336 - I'm gonna sell all the chickens\\
337 - and get out of this chicken business.\\
338 - Hi, Ricardo.\\
339 - Hi, Ramsey.\\
340 - Want to ride bikes?\\
341 - Uh-uh.\\
342 - Why not?\\
343 - I don't feel like it.\\
344 - What's wrong?\\
345 - We're going to have to get rid of all
our chickens.\\
346 - How come?\\
347 - They don't lay enough eggs\\
348 - so my daddy says they got to go.\\
349 - That's what mine said when our cat
had kittens.\\
350 - Did he give the kittens away?\\
351 - He couldn't.\\
352 - How come?\\
353 - Because I hid the kittens\\
354 - so he couldn't find them.\\
355 - Hey!\\
356 - Think we could hide chickens?\\
357 - How many chickens are there?\\
358 - 200.\\
359 - Boy, I think this is going to be\\
360 - a little tougher than kittens.\\
361 - Come on, Bruce, let's get started.\\
362 - Okay.\\
363 - Fred?\\
364 - Yeah?\\
365 - Well, where are they?\\
366 - Where are who?\\
367 - The chickens, that's who.\\
368 - The poultry man is outside waiting to
buy them\\
369 - and they've all disappeared.\\
370 - Well, don't tell me your troubles.\\
371 - Now, look, Fred, you're in charge of
the chickens.\\
372 - Now where are they?\\
373 - I was in charge of the chickens\\
374 - I quit, remember?\\
375 - As long as you're staying here\\
376 - the chickens are your responsibility.\\
377 - I'm not staying here, we're moving
out.\\
378 - Who do you mean by we?\\
379 - Me and my wife, Mrs. Mertz.\\
380 - You sure that's everybody that's
moving out?\\
381 - What are you driving at?\\
382 - I'm not driving at anything, Fred.\\
383 - Just so happens this room is full of
chicken feathers.\\
384 - So what?\\
385 - So what?\\
386 - Yeah, so what?\\
387 - So how'd they get here?\\
388 - Don't ask me.\\
389 - You know what a miserable housekeeper
Ethel is.\\
390 - What's that, Fred?\\
391 - How should I know?\\
392 - Well, it doesn't sound like Perry
Como.\\
393 - My, what a lovely hat.\\
394 - Well, Fred?\\
395 - Well, what?\\
396 - Now, look, Fred,\\
397 - just because there was no profit out
of the egg business,\\
398 - there's no reason for you to plan\\
399 - to walk off with 200 chickens.\\
400 - Just a minute.\\
401 - Are you calling me a chicken thief?\\
402 - Those are your words, not mine.\\
403 - I don't know how this chicken got in
here\\
404 - and I don't care,\\
405 - but I defy you to find another one in
this house.\\
406 - You got some friends around here?\\
407 - All right, Fred.\\
408 - All right what?\\
409 - Look, I'll tell you what I'm going to
do.\\
410 - I'm going to go over to the house,\\
411 - I'm gonna wait there for 20 minutes.\\
412 - Now, if the chickens reappear\\
413 - there will be no questions asked\\
414 - and I will not prosecute.\\
415 - Just a minute.\\
416 - Just a chicken-pickin' minute.\\
417 - Gee, Ethel, I just feel terrible.\\
418 - Me, too.\\
419 - You and Fred moving back to the city.\\
420 - I don't want you to move away.\\
421 - Well, I guess friends should never\\
422 - go into business together.\\
423 - Yeah, I guess you're right.\\
424 - I wonder how Sears and Roebuck
handled it?\\
425 - Well, for one thing, Sears wasn't a
stubborn Irishman\\
426 - and Roebuck wasn't a hot-tempered
Latin.\\
427 - Yeah, I guess you're right.\\
428 - Well, even though we're not going to
be neighbors anymore,\\
429 - you and Fred can come out and visit
us on weekends.\\
430 - Oh, Fred's so mad\\
431 - it'll be years before I can drag him
out here again.\\
432 - Yeah.\\
433 - Well, we can meet secretly for lunch
at Schraft's.\\
434 - We can do that.\\
435 - Yeah.\\
436 - Well, I got to go help Fred with the
packing.\\
437 - Okay.\\
438 - Dear.\\
439 - So long.\\
440 - Oh.\\
441 - Oh, I almost forgot, my fur jacket's
in your closet.\\
442 - Oh.\\
443 - Hey.\\
444 - Why don't you leave it there?\\
445 - Pretend that you forgot it\\
446 - and you can come out and get it next
week.\\
447 - Oh, that's a wonderful idea, Lucy.\\
448 - Maybe by that time our gladiators
will have cooled off.\\
449 - Come on, you coward, put up your
dukes.\\
450 - I'll paste you right in the mouth.\\
451 - I'd like to see you try.\\
452 - Yeah, well, step outside.\\
453 - We just came in from outside.\\
454 - What's going on?\\
455 - He called me a chicken thief.\\
456 - That's what's going on.\\
457 - A chicken thief?\\
458 - There are 200 chickens missing\\
459 - and I found a bunch of them over at
their place.\\
460 - Oh, this is ridiculous.\\
461 - Fred didn't steal any chickens.\\
462 - Did you, Fred?\\
463 - Of course not.\\
464 - See, Ricky, if he says he didn't take
them\\
465 - he didn't take them.\\
466 - How do you know?\\
467 - If there's one thing Fred isn't--\\
468 - and there's only one thing Fred
isn't--\\
469 - it's a chicken thief.\\
470 - Thanks, Ethel.\\
471 - All right, then, Ethel\\
472 - let me ask you a question.\\
473 - How did a chicken get into your
hatbox?\\
474 - How did a chicken get into my hatbox?\\
475 - Yeah, how did it get in there, Ethel?\\
476 - Lucy, are you going to stand there\\
477 - and let him accuse me, too?\\
478 - Well, how did that chicken get in
your hatbox?\\
479 - That does it.\\
480 - We're leaving, and I'll just take my
fur jacket with me.\\
481 - I wouldn't want to make another trip
out here\\
482 - to pick it up.\\
483 - Now who's a chicken thief?\\
484 - You're a pretty cool cookie\\
485 - planting those birds in our place\\
486 - just to throw us off the track.\\
487 - I don't know what you're talking
about.\\
488 - You were going to call me a chicken
thief\\
489 - and get me to leave\\
490 - and then sell all the chickens to the
poultry man\\
491 - and collect all the money!\\
492 - Oh, no, Fred.\\
493 - He isn't that clever.\\
494 - But there's someone in this room who
is.\\
495 - Are you calling me a chicken thief?\\
496 - Those are your words, not mine.\\
497 - You've got a lot of nerve,\\
498 - you and your hatbox full of chicken
feathers.\\
499 - Yeah, yeah.\\
500 - I suppose you want me to think those
birds\\
501 - walked in to that closet and shut the
door behind them.\\
502 - I have no idea how those birds got
into that closet.\\
503 - I bet he's got them stashed all over
the place.\\
504 - I'll bet they have, too.\\
505 - How do I know how they got in there?\\
506 - Oh, isn't that...\\
507 - What are you doing in there?\\
508 - Yeah, you know what he's doing in
there.\\
509 - You put him in there!\\
510 - I did not!\\
511 - Hello?\\
512 - What?\\
513 - Oh, no.\\
514 - Thank you.\\
515 - What is it?\\
516 - That was Betty Ramsey.\\
517 - Her little Bruce's room is full of
our chickens.\\
518 - How did they get there?\\
519 - I don't know, but I have a sneaking
suspicion.\\
520 - Little Ricky!\\
521 - What, Mommy?\\
522 - Have you been hiding our chickens,
dear?\\
523 - Come on, son, tell us the
truth.\\
524 - Will I get a spanking, Daddy?\\
525 - No, not if you tell me the truth.\\
526 - Bruce and I hid them.\\
527 - Why did you and Bruce hide them?\\
528 - I didn't want you to give them away.\\
529 - Gee, Fred...\\
530 - I'm sorry I called you a chicken
thief.\\
531 - That's all right, Rick.\\
532 - I've been called worse things by
Ethel.\\
533 - Lucy, can you forgive me?\\
534 - Can you forgive me?\\
535 - I guess it'll take more than a bunch
of chickens\\
536 - to break our friendship.
Right.\\
537 - How about the chickens, Daddy, can we
keep them?\\
538 - Well, I don't know if we can keep
them or not, son.\\
539 - You see, Uncle Fred and I\\
540 - went into the egg business
together...\\
541 - Hey, look what I found in my bedroom.\\
542 - Our chickens are laying, our chickens
are laying eggs.\\
543 - Well, the Ricardos and the Mertzes\\
544 - are in business together!\\
545 - Oh, I'll help you unpack!
\subsection {Episode 21: Ragtime Band (1957)}
1 - Hi, honey, I saw you drive in.\\
2 - Hi.\\
3 - How was the meeting?\\
4 - Oh, it was all right.\\
5 - Did you see Fred and Little Ricky out
there\\
6 - playing baseball with the
neighborhood kids?\\
7 - Yeah, I saw them.\\
8 - Uh-oh, Fred struck out again.\\
9 - He's so vain, he won't wear his
glasses\\
10 - and he can't see the ball without
them.\\
11 - Well, what's new with the Westport
Historical Society?\\
12 - What's the matter, honey?\\
13 - Oh, Ethel,\\
14 - I've done something awful.\\
15 - What is it this time?\\
16 - Now, if you take that tone, I may not
tell you.\\
17 - Good.\\
18 - Come back here.\\
19 - I have to tell someone.\\
20 - Okay.\\
21 - What is it?\\
22 - Well, our historical society's having\\
23 - its annual fundraising drive\\
24 - and today we were planning the show\\
25 - and everyone was promising what their
husbands would do.\\
26 - Uh-oh.\\
27 - Betty Ramsey said\\
28 - that her husband would get the
advertising for the program\\
29 - and Gertrude Foote said that her
husband would\\
30 - print the programs\\
31 - and Grace Munson said that her
husband\\
32 - would take care of the floral
decorations and...\\
33 - well...\\
34 - Out with it.\\
35 - Well, everyone was volunteering their
husbands\\
36 - and I jumped up and said\\
37 - that Ricky and his band would play
for the show.\\
38 - Oh, Lucy, how are you going\\
39 - to break this to him?\\
40 - Oh, I don't know.\\
41 - This is a tough one.\\
42 - Gee!\\
43 - I could try buttering him up; that
always works...\\
44 - sometimes.\\
45 - Lucy, there isn't buttering-up in the
world\\
46 - that could get Ricky to bring his
band\\
47 - out here to Westport to play for a
show\\
48 - put on by a historical society.\\
49 - You forget I'm a pretty good
butter-upper.\\
50 - Let's see now.\\
51 - When he gets home,\\
52 - I'll have a delicious dinner waiting
for him.\\
53 - I'll put him down on the divan.\\
54 - I'll give him the evening paper and
his slippers.\\
55 - I'll get him in a very good mood.\\
56 - How's that sound?\\
57 - Great, as long as you don't tell him.\\
58 - Oh, Ethel!\\
59 - Heavens!\\
60 - Well, hi, dear.\\
61 - What's the matter, Ricky?\\
62 - Oh, nothing!\\
63 - What's the matter with him, Fred?\\
64 - Oh, the other kids threw him out of
the ball game\\
65 - because he can't play as well as they
can.\\
66 - Aw, the poor little thing.\\
67 - Yeah, well, these country kids get
more time to practice\\
68 - than the city kids, but he'll learn.\\
69 - Oh, sure he will.\\
70 - Oh, poor kid.\\
71 - Now, now, Lucy, let him alone.\\
72 - There are some things a man has just
got to\\
73 - work out for himself.\\
74 - Yeah, I guess you're right.\\
75 - Well, how'd you do, Babe Ruth?\\
76 - Oh, they threw me out of the game,
too.\\
77 - You poor little thing.\\
78 - Good luck with both your Rickys.\\
79 - Well, hi, darling.\\
80 - Hi, honey.\\
81 - Did you have a hard day?\\
82 - Well...\\
83 - How'd everything go at the club?\\
84 - I'll bet that was\\
85 - a long, tiring ride home on the
train, huh, honey?\\
86 - You just sit down here and don't you
worry\\
87 - about a thing, sweetheart.\\
88 - You just sit, and here's your evening
paper\\
89 - and here are your bedroom slippers.\\
90 - Thank you.\\
91 - My, I sure missed you today.\\
92 - My shoes, dear.
Oh.\\
93 - I sure missed you today, dear.\\
94 - I wish you didn't have to go\\
95 - into New York every day, sweetheart.\\
96 - It would be nice if you could stay\\
97 - around here with me all the time.\\
98 - It would be kind of nice.\\
99 - Oh, I'd sure love that.\\
100 - Now, honey, you just sit right up
there\\
101 - and you be comfy-cozy, see?\\
102 - And don't you worry about a thing.\\
103 - And dinner will be ready in a little
while.\\
104 - And do you know what we're having?\\
105 - It's one of your favorites.\\
106 - Smell that?
What does it smell like?\\
107 - It smells like you want me and the
band for that show.\\
108 - Oh, no, no, no.\\
109 - We're having chicken and rice and
fried bana...\\
110 - How'd you find out?\\
111 - Betty Ramsey just told me.\\
112 - I forgot Betty Ramsey was gonna drive
you home\\
113 - from the station.\\
114 - Well, that's one of the hazards of
living in the suburbs.\\
115 - Yeah, well.\\
116 - Well, now that you know\\
117 - all about it, Ricky, will you?\\
118 - No.\\
119 - And I spent two hours over a hot
stove\\
120 - cooking chicken and rice.\\
121 - Well, don't worry about that, honey,
I'll eat it.\\
122 - But Ricky, just tell me why.\\
123 - Because I love chicken and rice.\\
124 - Oh, I mean, why won't you play for
the show?\\
125 - Look, I'm not gonna transport my
whole band\\
126 - to Westport, Connecticut,\\
127 - and besides, you know that we have to
play at the club.\\
128 - Well, maybe you could just give us a
few of them,\\
129 - you know, like the piano and the
drums and the...\\
130 - whatever you call them.\\
131 - The claves and the maracas.\\
132 - Yeah.\\
133 - No.
Oh.\\
134 - It's such a worthy cause, honey.\\
135 - I know, dear, and I'll be very happy
to give them some money.\\
136 - Oh, the money's not important;\\
137 - it's the spirit of the thing.\\
138 - It's a community project.\\
139 - And we need your band to play if we
want the entertainment good.\\
140 - Oh, honey, I'm sorry, but I cannot do
it, and that's final.\\
141 - But, uh, thanks for the paper and the
slippers\\
142 - and the chicken and rice and the soft
soap.\\
143 - Where's Ricky?\\
144 - He's up in his room.\\
145 - Hey, partner!\\
146 - I think maybe you'd better go up and
have a talk with him.\\
147 - He's a little upset.\\
148 - Oh, what's the matter?\\
149 - Well, the kids wouldn't\\
150 - let him play baseball with them
today.\\
151 - They said he wasn't good enough.\\
152 - Oh, dear.\\
153 - Well, I'll go up\\
154 - and have a little father-and-son talk
with him.\\
155 - And after dinner,\\
156 - you can have a little
husband-and-wife talk with me.\\
157 - This little husband is through
talking.\\
158 - Now, the issue is closed.\\
159 - Well, if you won't bring your band,\\
160 - what are we gonna do for music?\\
161 - Well, you play a pretty mean
saxophone.\\
162 - Maybe some of your friends can play.\\
163 - Organize your own band.\\
164 - I promised them Ricky Ricardo.\\
165 - All right, just go...\\
166 - Maybe they won't notice.\\
167 - Oh!\\
168 - Honey, I forgot\\
169 - to bring these eggs over this
morning.\\
170 - Thanks.\\
171 - Look at the size of that one.\\
172 - That's nothing compared to the one\\
173 - I just laid with Ricky.\\
174 - Uh-oh.\\
175 - What happened to your buttering-up
plan?\\
176 - Well, Betty Ramsey spilled the whole
thing\\
177 - before I even got my churn started.\\
178 - Well, I hate to say I told you so...\\
179 - Well, don't, then!\\
180 - I have to call the historical society\\
181 - and tell them Ricky can't make it.\\
182 - Oh, honestly, that Betty Ramsey-- big
blabbermouth.\\
183 - Hello, is this the Westport
Historical Society?\\
184 - Well, this is Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.\\
185 - Yes, I just called to say that...\\
186 - Oh.\\
187 - Oh, really?\\
188 - Oh, well, that's wonderful.\\
189 - Yes.\\
190 - Yes, that...
Oh, that's wonderful.\\
191 - Well, I just called to say that...\\
192 - Ricky will be delighted to play.\\
193 - Good-bye.\\
194 - What'd you say that for?\\
195 - She said on the strength of Ricky's
appearance,\\
196 - tickets are selling like hot cakes.\\
197 - Oh, dear.\\
198 - Wait till they hear the bad news.\\
199 - They'll have to change their name\\
200 - to the Westport Hysterical Society.\\
201 - Ethel, I promised them Ricky Ricardo\\
202 - and I'm gonna deliver Ricky Ricardo!\\
203 - Huh?\\
204 - Junior.\\
205 - Little Ricky?\\
206 - Yeah, why not?
They both play drums.\\
207 - Yeah, that's right.\\
208 - Oh, Lucy, I gotta hand it to you.\\
209 - You get caught in a jam\\
210 - and you're able to produce another
Ricky Ricardo.\\
211 - Well, I always believe in having a
spare.\\
212 - So you got a drummer.\\
213 - Where are you going to get the rest
of the band?\\
214 - I got the rest of the band.\\
215 - Lucy Ricardo on saxophone, Ethel
Mertz on the piano...\\
216 - Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.\\
217 - Who was that on the 88 again?\\
218 - The wizard of the ivories, Ethel May
Mertz.\\
219 - Well, maybe so.\\
220 - Yeah, and I got...\\
221 - Just to round out the rest of the
quartet,\\
222 - I have Fred Mertz on the violin.\\
223 - Does he still have his fiddle?\\
224 - Yeah, but the last time he played, it
was three chins ago.\\
225 - Don't worry. I'm sure if he
practices,\\
226 - he'll play just like he used to.\\
227 - Oh, well, then, Lucy, whatever you
do,\\
228 - don't let him practice.\\
229 - Now, Ethel, it's gonna be great.\\
230 - Our little band is gonna burst upon
the music world.\\
231 - We are gonna be the new sound.\\
232 - Okay, Fred, you stay right there\\
233 - and be our audience.\\
234 - You tell us what you think.\\
235 - What are you doing?\\
236 - I'm limbering up my fingers.\\
237 - Think what she'd have sounded like
unlimbered.\\
238 - Oh, now, Fred.\\
239 - Boy, I haven't had this thing out of
the case in years.\\
240 - Ooh, I even forgot to take this off.\\
241 - How do you like that?\\
242 - What? Oh!\\
243 - Gosh!\\
244 - You ought to take that out\\
245 - in the backyard and beat it.\\
246 - Oh, I know.\\
247 - oh, Fred, Fred!\\
248 - That cat sounded better when it was
alive.\\
249 - Oh, never mind the wisecracks.\\
250 - There's something wrong.\\
251 - Yeah, what is all that?\\
252 - Confetti.\\
253 - The last time I played this thing\\
254 - was at a Roosevelt rally.\\
255 - He means Teddy.\\
256 - She knows who I mean.\\
257 - Mommy, can we start now?\\
258 - Yeah, as soon as we get tuned up,
honey.\\
259 - Give me an "A," Ethel.\\
260 - An "A"?
Yeah.\\
261 - Oh, an "A."\\
262 - Is that a black key\\
263 - or a white one?\\
264 - Ethel plays by ear.\\
265 - Oh.\\
266 - The trouble is, we have to listen by
ear.\\
267 - Lucy, how about a middle "C"?\\
268 - I know where that one is.\\
269 - Well, thanks a lot, girl, but I gotta
have an "A."\\
270 - Oh, well, there has to be one on here
someplace.\\
271 - Let's see now.\\
272 - Is that an "A"?\\
273 - Oh, thank you, honey!\\
274 - So you had to go and find the "A."\\
275 - Let's hear your "A," Jascha.\\
276 - Sounds more like a "Z."\\
277 - Oh, is that so?\\
278 - Oh, come on, you two, let's get
started, huh?\\
279 - Yeah, what are we gonna play?\\
280 - Well, I only know that one tune\\
281 - "Comin' 'Round The Mountain."\\
282 - For heaven's sake, Ethel, don't you
know "Sweet Sue"?\\
283 - No. Why?\\
284 - 'Cause that's the only tune I know.\\
285 - I never learned "Sweet Sue."\\
286 - Well, you could; you play by ear.\\
287 - Come on, try "Sweet Sue."\\
288 - Well, I'll try it, but don't blame me\\
289 - if it sounds like "Sweet Sue is
Comin' 'Round The Mountain."\\
290 - Ready, everybody?\\
291 - Yeah.\\
292 - A-one, a-two...\\
293 - Hold it, hold it.\\
294 - Honey, aren't you playing\\
295 - a little too fast?\\
296 - No, Mommy, you're playing too slow.\\
297 - Oh, we're playing too slow.\\
298 - Well, we'll try to speed it up.\\
299 - Let's try it again now.\\
300 - A-one, a-two...\\
301 - Honey...\\
302 - honey, are you sure you're not
playing too fast?\\
303 - Yes, Mommy, I'm sure.\\
304 - How would you like to go outside and
play\\
305 - and let us practice for a while?\\
306 - Great! Thanks.\\
307 - Thanks, yet.\\
308 - Come on, we can get it.\\
309 - Let's try it again.\\
310 - I can do that "a-one, a-two" thing.\\
311 - A-one, a-two...\\
312 - Honey, I'm home!\\
313 - Oh, hi, darling.\\
314 - Hi, dear.\\
315 - Aw, gee, you look tired.\\
316 - I'm bushed.\\
317 - Dinner ready?\\
318 - Not yet. Why don't you stretch out
and take a nap?\\
319 - Good idea.\\
320 - There you are.\\
321 - Okay?\\
322 - Yeah, thanks.\\
323 - Ricky?\\
324 - Mm.\\
325 - We had our first rehearsal today.\\
326 - Mm-hmm.\\
327 - Aren't you gonna ask me how it went?\\
328 - All right. How'd it go?\\
329 - Don't ask.\\
330 - What happened?\\
331 - Well, naturally, Little Ricky was
just wonderful on the drums\\
332 - and I was pretty good on the
saxophone if I do say so myself.\\
333 - But Fred's violin and Ethel's piano--
sheesh!\\
334 - Pretty bad, huh?\\
335 - Oh, Fred's violin sounds\\
336 - like he's breaking in a new pair of
shoes.\\
337 - And what Ethel does to those ivories\\
338 - is enough to make an elephant want to
take back his tusks.\\
339 - So what do you want me to do?\\
340 - Well, honey, we're having another
rehearsal after dinner\\
341 - tonight, see, and I thought maybe you
could tell them\\
342 - in a nice way, you know, what they're
doing wrong.\\
343 - All right, dear, I'll see what I can
do.\\
344 - Will you do that, dear?
Sure.\\
345 - Well, now you just take a nice nap\\
346 - and I'll let you know when dinner's
ready.\\
347 - Thank you.\\
348 - Ricky.\\
349 - Where's Lucy?\\
350 - She's in the kitchen.
What's the matter?\\
351 - Oh. Well, uh... Rick,\\
352 - we had our first rehearsal this
afternoon,\\
353 - and I want to talk to you about our
little group.\\
354 - All right.\\
355 - Well, of course, Ricky, Jr., was\\
356 - just wonderful on the drums\\
357 - and I was pretty good on the piano,
too,\\
358 - but Lucy and Fred...
whew-ew!\\
359 - Pretty bad, huh?\\
360 - Oh, yeah, it was bad.\\
361 - Well, maybe they'll get better with
practice.\\
362 - Well, maybe, but you should have
heard them.\\
363 - Lucy playing the saxophone\\
364 - sounds like a wounded moose calling
to its mate.\\
365 - And Fred's violin?\\
366 - Oh, I make better music when I file
my nails.\\
367 - Rick?\\
368 - We're gonna have another rehearsal
tonight\\
369 - and I thought maybe you might just
stick around\\
370 - and-and straighten them out, huh?\\
371 - All right, I'll see what I can do.\\
372 - You will?
Mm-hmm.\\
373 - Oh, bless you, Rick.\\
374 - Thank you.\\
375 - You're welcome.\\
376 - Where is...?\\
377 - She's in the kitchen.\\
378 - I'm in trouble.\\
379 - What's the matter, Fred?\\
380 - Rick, could I talk to you\\
381 - as one professional musician to
another?\\
382 - Sure, Fred.\\
383 - Well, we had that rehearsal this
afternoon.\\
384 - Oh, is that so?
Yeah.\\
385 - Well, how did it go, Fred?\\
386 - Little Ricky and I were okay.\\
387 - But the women...\\
388 - Bad, eh?\\
389 - The way Ethel hits those piano
keys...\\
390 - I wouldn't blame them if they hit her
back.\\
391 - And Lucy with that saxophone...\\
392 - it's a wonder every hog in Westport
didn't answer the call.\\
393 - Well, now, look, Fred, you're gonna
have another rehearsal\\
394 - after dinner, is that right?\\
395 - Yeah.\\
396 - Well, I'll tell you what I'll do.\\
397 - I'll see if I can tell the girls\\
398 - in a nice way what they're doing
wrong.\\
399 - You took the words right out of my
mouth. See you later.\\
400 - Right, bye-bye.
Bye.\\
401 - Daddy?\\
402 - Oh, hiya, partner.\\
403 - How are you?\\
404 - Can I talk to you a minute?\\
405 - Sure. What is it?\\
406 - Our band.\\
407 - Your band? Well, how did the
rehearsal go?\\
408 - Eesh!\\
409 - You mean that Uncle Fred and Aunt
Ethel\\
410 - and Mommy are pretty bad, huh?\\
411 - Boy, I'll say.\\
412 - Well, maybe they're not as bad as you
think.\\
413 - Oh, yes, they are.\\
414 - Well, maybe they'll get better\\
415 - with a little practice.\\
416 - I don't want to play with them
anymore.\\
417 - Don't want to play with them anymore?\\
418 - Well, now, wait a minute, that's not
very nice.\\
419 - You remember what happened to you
yesterday\\
420 - when you were playing baseball with
those kids\\
421 - and they didn't want you to play with
them anymore?\\
422 - But I play baseball better than they
play music.\\
423 - That's not the point, though.\\
424 - You know, when we had our little
talk,\\
425 - we agreed that it wasn't nice\\
426 - to be unkind to people, right?\\
427 - Yes, Daddy.\\
428 - So we can't just tell them\\
429 - that they don't play well, can we?\\
430 - No, Daddy.\\
431 - Now, the thing to do is\\
432 - to teach them to play better.\\
433 - So, tonight after dinner,\\
434 - you're gonna have a rehearsal\\
435 - and I'll stick around\\
436 - and I'll see what I can do, okay?\\
437 - Okay, Daddy.\\
438 - Okay, son.\\
439 - Dinner, everybody!\\
440 - Did you have\\
441 - a nice nap, sweetie?\\
442 - Sheesh!\\
443 - Look, let's try it one more time from
the top.\\
444 - Okay.\\
445 - Now, please, everybody, will you try
to remember\\
446 - what I told you that you were doing
wrong?\\
447 - Oh, sure, sure, sure.\\
448 - One more time.\\
449 - It's a nice simple tune.\\
450 - It should be bright and happy and
relaxed.\\
451 - Yeah, aha, that's the way it should
go, just like that.\\
452 - Yeah, boy.\\
453 - Right here, eh?\\
454 - Right here, huh?\\
455 - One, two...\\
456 - Hold it, hold it, everyone. Hold it.\\
457 - Hold it.\\
458 - Hold it, everybody.\\
459 - Before we go any further, there is
something that I have to say.\\
460 - We'll listen to you.
Oh, well, just say it, Rick.\\
461 - Go ahead and say it.
Go ahead, honey, go ahead.\\
462 - Well, you know, Little Ricky's fine
on the drums.\\
463 - Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
That's right.\\
464 - But some of the rest of you need a
little work.\\
465 - Yeah, some of us are pretty bad.\\
466 - Yeah, some of us are.\\
467 - Yeah, some of us.\\
468 - Well, to tell you the truth, you
know...\\
469 - Go ahead, Rick, be frank.\\
470 - Sure, just speak right out.\\
471 - Sure, they can take it.\\
472 - I mean, we can take it.\\
473 - Well... it's... it's...
the situation is, you know\\
474 - that you play fine, you play good,
you know.\\
475 - As a matter of fact, you play too
good.\\
476 - Well, it's that you-you're so far
ahead of your time\\
477 - the public is not ready, for your
type of music.\\
478 - Really?\\
479 - Take my word for it as a musician.\\
480 - They are not ready.\\
481 - Oh. Well, that's too bad\\
482 - because the show is tomorrow night.\\
483 - Yeah.
What are we gonna do?\\
484 - Yeah, well, you know, honey,\\
485 - I-I-I-I realize that, you know, it's
such an emergency--\\
486 - and boy, is it an emergency--\\
487 - that, uh, well, I thought maybe I can
get away from the club\\
488 - for an hour and bring a couple of the
boys down\\
489 - and I'll do a calypso number.\\
490 - A calypso.
That would be wonderful.\\
491 - From my album, you know.\\
492 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
493 - Well, if you're just gonna bring a
couple of the boys,\\
494 - then you'll need some of us,\\
495 - some of us that aren't too bad, you
know.\\
496 - Oh, sure, sure, you will.\\
497 - No.\\
498 - You said we were pretty good.\\
499 - I did, didn't I?\\
500 - Yeah, I did that, and I meant it.\\
501 - Meant every word of it.\\
502 - And, by God, I think that you should
be in it!\\
503 - Oh.\\
504 - Yes, sir, and I want you in it.
I want you in the band.\\
505 - Oh, well, good.\\
506 - Right. I tell you,\\
507 - right in that rhythm section, that's
where you'll be.\\
508 - The rhythm section?
Yeah.\\
509 - What do we do?\\
510 - Oh, well, you, you...
I'll tell you what.\\
511 - Little Ricky can play the bongos\\
512 - and Fred can play the quijada and
Ethel can play the cencerros\\
513 - and you can play the cuica.\\
514 - Oh, well, that's wonderful!\\
515 - What are we gonna play?\\
516 - The quijada, the cuica\\
517 - and the cencerros.\\
518 - Oh, is that good?\\
519 - Good. Oh, honey,\\
520 - that's the most, the most important
part.\\
521 - The cuica Cuica?\\
522 - is the most important part of the
calyso...\\
523 - I play the cuica.\\
524 - Hey, hey\\
525 - Hey, hey...\\
526 - Let us put men and women together\\
527 - To find out which one is smarter\\
528 - Some say men, but I say no\\
529 - The women got the men beat, they
should know\\
530 - Samson was the strongest man long ago\\
531 - No one could have beaten him as we
all know\\
532 - He clashed with Delilah and before he
knew what\\
533 - Samson had the world's very first
crew cut.\\
534 - Not me, other people, they say\\
535 - That the men are a-leadin' the women
astray\\
536 - But I say that the women of today\\
537 - Smarter than the man in every way.\\
538 - That's right, the woman is...\\
539 - Smarter!\\
540 - That's right, the woman is...\\
541 - Smarter!\\
542 - That's right, the woman is...\\
543 - Smarter!\\
544 - That's right.\\
545 - That's right.\\
546 - Your wife announces that you and she\\
547 - Are expectin' an addition to the
family\\
548 - You sing and dance and yell hurrah\\
549 - But she only expectin' your
mother-in-law.\\
550 - Not me, other people, they say\\
551 - That the men are leadin' the women

\subsection {Episode 22: Lucy's Night In Town (1957)}
1 - Honey, aren't you gonna eat any
breakfast?\\
2 - Oh, no, I'm too excited to eat.\\
3 - Excited about what?\\
4 - About what?\\
5 - This is my first trip into New York
City\\
6 - since we moved to the country,\\
7 - and that was six whole weeks ago.\\
8 - I'll bet I won't even recognize the
old place.\\
9 - Well, it has changed a little.\\
10 - They got skyscrapers now.\\
11 - Oh, you... you get to go into town
every day\\
12 - while I'm stuck out here in the
country.\\
13 - What do you mean "stuck"?\\
14 - You're the one who wanted to move to
the suburbs\\
15 - so you could get out of the dirty old
city.\\
16 - Oh, I like it out here.\\
17 - It's just that after six weeks of
fresh, clean country air,\\
18 - a woman looks forward to one day of
city dirt.\\
19 - Am I going, Mommy?\\
20 - No, honey, you're gonna stay
overnight with Bruce Ramsey.\\
21 - Why can't I go?
I like dirt.\\
22 - He likes dirt.\\
23 - Well, honey, we're gonna be out so
late.\\
24 - Mommy and Daddy are gonna go to see a
show\\
25 - with Uncle Fred and Aunt Ethel.\\
26 - What show?\\
27 - It's called The Most Happy Fella.\\
28 - Can I see it sometime?\\
29 - Well, you're a little bit too young
for theater, partner.\\
30 - Yeah, you can see it when you grow
up, honey.\\
31 - At the rate they're selling tickets,
it'll still be playing.\\
32 - That's right.\\
33 - Say, would you do me a favor?\\
34 - What?\\
35 - Would you go out to the guest house\\
36 - and tell Uncle Fred that I'm about
ready to leave?\\
37 - Okay, Daddy.
Thank you.\\
38 - Fred's going into town when you do,
huh?\\
39 - Yeah. Today is his day to collect the
rent\\
40 - on their apartment.
Oh.\\
41 - Say, about the tickets now,\\
42 - are you sure you know where they are?\\
43 - Yes, honey, I'm sure.\\
44 - I put them in my dresser drawer\\
45 - in my jewel box with my good jewelry\\
46 - six months ago.\\
47 - All right. And you won't forget to
bring them with you?\\
48 - Well, I thought I'd throw them in the
wastebasket\\
49 - just before I left the house.\\
50 - Oh, my. Oh, my.\\
51 - I'm just checking.\\
52 - And you're sure you got the right
date?\\
53 - Yes, honey, I'm sure I have the right
date.\\
54 - I put a ring around the date on the
calendar.\\
55 - I made a mental note of it.\\
56 - I entered it my engagement book.\\
57 - I did everything but hire an elephant\\
58 - and tie a string around its trunk.\\
59 - Yeah, but are you sure you got the
right date?\\
60 - Oh, honestly, Ricky, just this once,\\
61 - can't you give me credit for doing
something right?\\
62 - All right, now, now, don't get so
touchy.\\
63 - Well, honestly.
Well, you know how you are.\\
64 - No. How am I?\\
65 - Well, to tell you the truth, you're a
little...\\
66 - Oh, now, come on.\\
67 - Really!\\
68 - Okay, okay, I trust you.\\
69 - Well, thanks a lot.\\
70 - Listen, don't forget that Fred and I\\
71 - are gonna meet you and Ethel at
Meegham's Chop House.\\
72 - Okay.\\
73 - 7:30.\\
74 - Yes, dear.\\
75 - And be on time.\\
76 - Yes, dear.\\
77 - And don't go crazy, shopping in all
the stores.\\
78 - No, dear.\\
79 - Bye.\\
80 - Good-bye, dear.\\
81 - Sheesh!\\
82 - Ethel, isn't it fun being in town for
an evening?\\
83 - Ooh-huh.\\
84 - Would you ladies care to order now?\\
85 - Well, uh, we're waiting for our
husbands,\\
86 - but, uh, we do we have to get to the
theater,\\
87 - so maybe we'd better order something\\
88 - that doesn't take too long, huh?\\
89 - What's ready?
The roast beef's ready.\\
90 - Well, how's that for you?\\
91 - Oh, that's fine.\\
92 - All right, uh, four roast beefs,
medium,\\
93 - with, uh, mashed potatoes and lima
beans.\\
94 - Oh, lima beans.
Okay.\\
95 - Very well.\\
96 - Oh, Lucy, just think,\\
97 - we're gonna go to the theater
tonight.\\
98 - How about that?\\
99 - Where are we sitting?\\
100 - Sixth row, center.
Downstairs.\\
101 - Let me see the tickets.\\
102 - I'd just like to hold mine for a
while.\\
103 - Oh, you silly.\\
104 - I'll put them in my memory book.\\
105 - Now, Lucy, don't tell me you forgot
them.\\
106 - No, I did not forget them.\\
107 - Nobody seems to trust me anymore.\\
108 - Here they are.\\
109 - There you are-- row F, seats 104, 5,
6 and 7.\\
110 - What's the matter?\\
111 - What time is it, Ethel?\\
112 - It's, uh, 7:40.\\
113 - Why?\\
114 - Too late for the matinee, huh?\\
115 - Matinee?!\\
116 - Oh, no!\\
117 - Oh, Lucy, how could you?!\\
118 - Well, I wrote for the best seats on
the first available Saturday.\\
119 - I forgot all about the matinee.\\
120 - Oh, of all the dumb tricks.\\
121 - Well, at least I didn't lose them,\\
122 - you'll have to admit that.\\
123 - Well, bully for you.\\
124 - Maybe we can get four more seats at
the box office.\\
125 - Oh, you know this show's been sold
out for six months.\\
126 - Gee, it's too bad we didn't have
tickets to a stinker.\\
127 - What am I gonna tell Ricky?\\
128 - I don't know, but you'd better think
fast.\\
129 - Look, I'm gonna stall.\\
130 - Stall? What good would that do?\\
131 - Well, you know, he hates to get to
the theater late,\\
132 - so I'll, I'll take a long time eating
my dinner and,\\
133 - and, and then we'll miss the first
curtain, see,\\
134 - and then I'll say that oh, I heard
that\\
135 - the show was overrated,\\
136 - and I really don't want to go anyway.\\
137 - Yeah.
And you be sure and say...\\
138 - Oh, hi, Ricky.
Hi.\\
139 - Hi, honey.
Hi.\\
140 - Sorry, I'm late. My taxi got stuck in
the traffic.\\
141 - Oh.
Where's Fred?\\
142 - Oh, um, I don't know.\\
143 - I guess he's still collecting the
rent money\\
144 - at the apartment building.\\
145 - 10:30 in the morning till 7:30 at
night?\\
146 - Well, collecting the rent money\\
147 - is the highlight of the month to
Fred,\\
148 - and he likes to linger over it.\\
149 - Well, I guess we'd better order.\\
150 - We haven't got much time.\\
151 - Oh, uh, I already ordered, dear, four
roast beefs.\\
152 - Oh, that was a good idea.\\
153 - Yeah, I, uh, I thought roast beef was
a good idea\\
154 - at the time, but now I don't know.\\
155 - Steak might be nice, or, uh, maybe
some broiled chicken.\\
156 - What do you think about broiled
chicken, Ethel?\\
157 - Oh, uh, uh...\\
158 - Well, I like broiled chicken.\\
159 - 'Course, steak sounds very good, too.\\
160 - Maybe we should have some seafood.\\
161 - What month is this?
Is there an "r" in it?\\
162 - Uh...\\
163 - What's the matter with you two?\\
164 - You know we haven't got time to
change our order.\\
165 - Roast beef is fine.\\
166 - Oh, here's Fred.\\
167 - Hi, Fred.\\
168 - Oh, hiya, Fred.\\
169 - Are they still following me?\\
170 - Who?\\
171 - Oh, here we go again.\\
172 - Every time Fred has more than $10 in
his pocket,\\
173 - he imagines the entire underworld is
trailing him.\\
174 - Pipe down, will you, Ethel?\\
175 - I got $500 cash in this pocket,\\
176 - and two guys followed me from the
subway station.\\
177 - Well, if you're so nervous, why
didn't you take a taxi?\\
178 - I may be nervous, Ethel, but I'm not
panicky.\\
179 - Fred, are you really carrying $500 on
you?\\
180 - Shh! Do you want to get me bumped
off?\\
181 - Look, Fred, if you're that worried,\\
182 - I'll keep it for you in my wallet.\\
183 - No, thanks.
I want a safe place.\\
184 - A place no holdup man would ever
think of looking.\\
185 - Oh, well, then put it in my purse.\\
186 - Even I wouldn't think of looking
there.\\
187 - Hey, that's a good idea.\\
188 - His money belt is at the laundry.\\
189 - Say, Fred, we ordered roast beef for
you.\\
190 - Is that all right?\\
191 - That's swell. Thanks.\\
192 - Okay.\\
193 - Wanted to save time, you know.\\
194 - Yeah... good.\\
195 - This is great.\\
196 - Yeah, looks good.\\
197 - Mm-hmm.\\
198 - Mmm.\\
199 - Good roast beef.\\
200 - Mmm.\\
201 - What's the matter, honey, why aren't
you eating?\\
202 - Oh, I'm just waiting for my meat to
cool off.\\
203 - It's not too hot, dear, it's just
right.\\
204 - Well, they say hot food is bad for
the stomach.\\
205 - Who said that?\\
206 - I just did. Didn't you recognize my
voice?\\
207 - Come on, come on.\\
208 - Stop fooling around and eat your
food.\\
209 - We got to go to the theater.\\
210 - What are you doing?\\
211 - Will you please tell me what you are
doing?\\
212 - Chewing.\\
213 - I know that, but we have to get to
the theater.\\
214 - Can you chew any faster?\\
215 - Well, then go ahead.\\
216 - Why not?!\\
217 - I read somewhere that\\
218 - you should chew your food 25 times
before swallowing.\\
219 - Well, swallow it now and chew it
later.\\
220 - People should chew their food
thoroughly\\
221 - like animals do.\\
222 - Animals don't have to make an 8:30
curtain.\\
223 - Are you all right, Ethel?\\
224 - Yes. Why?\\
225 - Well, usually by now you've gobbled
your dinner\\
226 - and devoured half of mine.\\
227 - Well, I just decided\\
228 - to eat like the animals do, too.\\
229 - Just decided?\\
230 - You've been eating like a horse for
20 years.\\
231 - I also read where you should peel
lima beans\\
232 - to get the most out of them.\\
233 - Lucy...\\
234 - Yes, you see, all the vitamins are
under the upper epidermis.\\
235 - Lucy, what's up?\\
236 - Nothing's up.
I just think that it's,\\
237 - it's much better to be healthy than
to see an old show.\\
238 - Aha!\\
239 - You forgot the tickets!\\
240 - No, no. No, I didn't forget the
tickets, did I, Ethel?\\
241 - No, no, she, she didn't forget the
tickets.\\
242 - See? Here they are.\\
243 - Then what's the matter?
What's wrong?\\
244 - Well...\\
245 - Oh, no.\\
246 - Oh, oh, no!\\
247 - What? What?\\
248 - These tickets are for the matinee.\\
249 - For today's matinee.\\
250 - Don't tell me that.\\
251 - Honey, maybe we can get some more
tickets at the box office.\\
252 - How can get some more tickets?\\
253 - I asked you, "Have you got the
tickets?\\
254 - And you're sure you got the right
date?"\\
255 - You said, "I put them in my jewel
box. Oh, sure..."\\
256 - Look, the sign says "Sold Out."\\
257 - Let's stop this foolishness and go
home.\\
258 - Oh, now, Fred, it never hurts to try.\\
259 - We're in luck.\\
260 - He got 'em!\\
261 - Cancellations.
Right in front.\\
262 - This fellow just turned them in.\\
263 - Oh, honey, that's wonderful.\\
264 - See, we see the show after all.\\
265 - Wait a minute.
Wait a minute now.\\
266 - I only got two tickets.\\
267 - Two?\\
268 - Well, we were lucky to get these.\\
269 - These are box seats.
That's all they got.\\
270 - Only two, huh?\\
271 - Just two?\\
272 - I'm afraid so.\\
273 - Oh.\\
274 - Well, um, which two of us are gonna
get to see the show?\\
275 - Well, it's my fault that we missed
the matinee,\\
276 - so you two go.\\
277 - No, Lucy.\\
278 - You've been counting on this for
months. You go.\\
279 - Oh. Well, no, I don't deserve to go.\\
280 - You take the tickets.\\
281 - Okay, we'll go.\\
282 - Oh...\\
283 - How come you get to go?\\
284 - I'm the one that's been counting on
this for months.\\
285 - Well, you just said we should go.\\
286 - Well, I didn't think you'd take me up
on it.\\
287 - Well, the show's starting.
Somebody'd better go.\\
288 - Well, who?\\
289 - Well, look, to make it really fair,\\
290 - why don't two of us see the first
half of the show,\\
291 - and then the other two will see the
last half.\\
292 - Yeah, that's a good idea.\\
293 - Yeah, okay. Which two of us will go
first?\\
294 - Why don't you two go first.\\
295 - Oh, no.\\
296 - All right, then we'll two, we'll go
first.\\
297 - Oh, no.\\
298 - All right, then you two girls go
first.\\
299 - Oh, fine.
Yeah, we'll see you here.\\
300 - All right, all right.\\
301 - Have a good time.\\
302 - Oh, it doesn't really matter.\\
303 - They can fill us in on what happened.\\
304 - Sure.\\
305 - I wonder what the story's all about?\\
306 - The
guy is not married.\\
307 - How you know that?\\
308 - Look at the title.\\
309 - Standing on the corner\\
310 - Watching all the girls go by\\
311 - Standing on the corner\\
312 - Underneath the springtime sky\\
313 - Brother, you can't go
to jail for what you're thinking\\
314 - Or for the ooh...
look in your eye\\
315 - You're only standing on the
corner\\
316 - Watching all the girls, watching all
the girls\\
317 - Watching all the girls\\
318 - Go by.\\
319 - Oh, Ethel, isn't it marvelous?\\
320 - Oh, that Frank Loesser music is just
great.\\
321 - Too bad we can't see the rest of it.\\
322 - Sure is.\\
323 - Hey, maybe we can see the rest of it.\\
324 - Oh, now, Lucy, we promised the
fellas.\\
325 - No, look, these people didn't show up
for the first act.\\
326 - Well, maybe they're still coming to
see the show.\\
327 - Oh, Ethel, do you know anyone who's
missed the whole first act\\
328 - and still wants to see the show?\\
329 - Sure, Ricky and Fred.\\
330 - Besides them.\\
331 - Look, here's what we'll do.\\
332 - We go out and give the tickets to the
fellas,\\
333 - and after they come back into the
theater,\\
334 - we'll just stroll back in with the
crowd.\\
335 - Oh, how could we do a thing like
that?\\
336 - We still got our programs in our
hands. Nobody'll stop us.\\
337 - Just look innocent, you know.\\
338 - Never mind. Just stay behind me. I'll
handle it.\\
339 - I said look innocent.\\
340 - The boss has treated you
pretty good, Joey.\\
341 - Yeah...\\
342 - Hi.\\
343 - Hi.\\
344 - Hi. How'd you get in here?\\
345 - We just strolled in with the crowd.\\
346 - Where you gonna sit?\\
347 - Right here.	Right here.\\
348 - Right there?\\
349 - Sure. These people didn't show up for
the first act,\\
350 - so evidently, they aren't coming.\\
351 - Honey, you can't sit there.\\
352 - We didn't pay for those seats.\\
353 - Oh, why not? They got all that extra
money\\
354 - for the matinee tickets we didn't
use.\\
355 - She's got a point there, Rick.\\
356 - Now we'll fill you in on the first
act.\\
357 - Yeah, see, this guy here, he isn't
married.\\
358 - What'd I tell you?\\
359 - He wrote a letter and...\\
360 - Don't cry\\
361 - Don't cry\\
362 - Come on back in the house\\
363 - And don't cry\\
364 - Come on back in the house\\
365 - And get out from under that old, cold
sky\\
366 - Don't weep\\
367 - Don't weep\\
368 - Come on back in the house, little
sheep\\
369 - Come on back...\\
370 - Could've come by train,\\
371 - but oh, no, you had to drive.\\
372 - Okay, okay, I had to drive.\\
373 - 65 miles an hour.\\
374 - I thought that judge would never let
us go.\\
375 - Look, we've already missed the first
act.\\
376 - You going to talk all the way through
the second?\\
377 - Oh, no.\\
378 - Shh, shh, shh!\\
379 - What are you doing?\\
380 - Shh, shh, shh!\\
381 - What are you doing?\\
382 - They took our seats.\\
383 - I know that, but you can't sit here.\\
384 - Why not?\\
385 - Shh!\\
386 - There's not enough room.\\
387 - They're sitting four people in two
seats!\\
388 - Go down and tell the manager.\\
389 - You go. I'd like to see just two
minutes of this show.\\
390 - I will not...\\
391 - Shh, shh, shh!\\
392 - I'm going to see the manager.\\
393 - Could you just move over a little?\\
394 - Just move over...\\
395 - I'm not pushing.\\
396 - Just move...\\
397 - Honey, I'd like some orangeade.\\
398 - Orangeade?\\
399 - Yes, I'm thirsty.\\
400 - Yeah, you're also crafty,\\
401 - but it won't work.\\
402 - You want an orangeade, go get it
yourself.\\
403 - Oh...\\
404 - And when you're down in the lobby,
stay there.\\
405 - Oh, shh!
Stop your grumbling.\\
406 - Shh!\\
407 - Wait a minute, wait a
minute\\
408 - You're from big D\\
409 - I can guess\\
410 - By the way you drawl and the way you
dress\\
411 - You're from big D\\
412 - My, oh, yes\\
413 - Big D, little A, double L, A-S...\\
414 - Where you going?\\
415 - I'm really thirsty.
I'm going to get some orangeade.\\
416 - Well, listen, get me some, too, will
you?\\
417 - Yeah, all right.
And...\\
418 - take your time.\\
419 - Oh, all right.\\
420 - Yes\\
421 - Big D, little A, double-L, A...\\
422 - Big D, little A, double-L, A...\\
423 - Big D, little A, double L, A-S...\\
424 - Move over, honey.\\
425 - I beg your pardon.\\
426 - Oh, sorry, wrong honey.\\
427 - Here you are, Ethel.\\
428 - What's this?\\
429 - Your bag. I knocked it off the
balcony,\\
430 - but thank goodness, I found it in the
aisle\\
431 - downstairs right next to a lady's
seat.\\
432 - Oh.\\
433 - Lucy!
What?\\
434 - This isn't my bag.\\
435 - Where are you going?\\
436 - Where you going?\\
437 - Downstairs.
We'll be right back.\\
438 - Well, don't hurry.\\
439 - This is most peculiar.\\
440 - Now, how could a thing like that
possibly happen?\\
441 - Well, it's perfectly obvious.\\
442 - Somebody hit me on the head with this\\
443 - and then made off with my purse.\\
444 - There's a purse snatcher somewhere
here in this theater.\\
445 - You know, maybe I'd better call the
police.\\
446 - Well, I think you...\\
447 - Just let us go down the aisle.\\
448 - We won't make any noise.\\
449 - There was $500 in her purse.\\
450 - I'm sorry. You'll have to see the
manager.\\
451 - There she is! That's the purse
snatcher.\\
452 - What? What are you talking about?\\
453 - That's my purse!\\
454 - Oh, and that's my purse.\\
455 - What are you doing with my purse?\\
456 - Oh, what are you doing with her
purse?\\
457 - Now, wait, wait.
just a minute.\\
458 - Uh-uh, wait a minute.\\
459 - I'll take care of these, please,\\
460 - until we find out for sure just what
happened.\\
461 - I told you what happened.\\
462 - She hit me over the head with that\\
463 - and stole my purse.\\
464 - Now, not at all.
It was an accident.\\
465 - I knocked her purse out of the
balcony\\
466 - where we were sitting and I went
downstairs\\
467 - and I picked up that purse,\\
468 - thinking it was this purse because in
a dark theater,\\
469 - that purse looks a lot like this
purse.\\
470 - In fact, right now\\
471 - you can't tell that purse from that
purse.\\
472 - All right, now, let me get this
straight.\\
473 - Now, this is the purse\\
474 - you thought was that purse...\\
475 - I thought this purse was this purse.\\
476 - This is her purse.
This is mine.\\
477 - All right, ladies, ladies, now,\\
478 - wait just a minute.\\
479 - Now, please, look, hold everything.\\
480 - Look, why doesn't everybody just take
her own purse?\\
481 - Yes.\\
482 - Now, is everybody happy?\\
483 - Well, I...I guess so.\\
484 - Nothing seems to be missing.\\
485 - Lucy...
What?\\
486 - ...the money's gone.\\
487 - Oh, no. Oh, no.\\
488 - She stole $500 out of my purse!\\
489 - Oh, don't be ridiculous!\\
490 - Well, if you didn't take it, where is
it?\\
491 - I have no idea.\\
492 - Are you sure you had $500 in your
purse?\\
493 - Oh, I'm positive.
Yes.\\
494 - Maybe she took it out\\
495 - before she threw it over the railing.\\
496 - Well, really!\\
497 - How dare you!\\
498 - She wouldn't do a thing like that!\\
499 - Would you, Lucy?\\
500 - Ethel!\\
501 - I'm sorry, honey, I'm so upset, I-I
don't know what I'm saying.\\
502 - You see, I have a penny-pinching
husband\\
503 - who's gonna kill me when he finds out
the money's gone.\\
504 - Well, lady, can you prove you had
$500 in your purse?\\
505 - No. Her penny-pinching husband can.\\
506 - Yes, yes. He's sitting in box A with
her husband.\\
507 - Now just go up Yes.	   there and
ask him.\\
508 - Look, would you go up and bring them
down here, please?\\
509 - Mr. Ricardo and Mr. Mertz.\\
510 - Ask them to come down right away.\\
511 - Tell them to hurry.
Lucy?\\
512 - Yes?\\
513 - Will you tell Fred when he gets here?\\
514 - What about you?\\
515 - Oh, I'll be standing right behind
you,\\
516 - bobbing and weaving.\\
517 - All right, Ethel, I'll tell him.\\
518 - I'll just say, "Fred, we lost your
$500.\\
519 - But I'll say, "Fred, it was your
fault\\
520 - for putting the money in Ethel's
purse."\\
521 - And then I'll say, "Fred, take your
hands\\
522 - from around Lucy's neck."\\
523 - That's right.\\
524 - What's the matter, what
happened?\\
525 - Is this a trick to get us out of the
seats?\\
526 - No. Now, Fred,\\
527 - Fred, something awful has happened.\\
528 - Uh, I accidentally knocked Ethel's
purse out of the box\\
529 - where we were sitting, and it hit
that woman on the head.\\
530 - Now, Fred, we got the purse back all
right, but...\\
531 - your $500 is missing.\\
532 - How's that, Fred?\\
533 - Oh, dear me.\\
534 - Oh, he must be delirious.\\
535 - Fred...\\
536 - Fred, your rent money's gone. Fred,
they lost it.\\
537 - I just pretended to put the money in
the purse\\
538 - to throw the pickpockets off the
track.\\
539 - You don't think I'd trust Ethel with
500 bucks, do you?\\
540 - Oh, dear me!	   Oh,
Fred...\\
541 - Oh...\\
542 - Oh, Fred, how could you do a thing
like that?\\
543 - Oh, I'm, I'm so sorry.\\
544 - Me, too, me, too, lady.\\
545 - Well, I guess we were all pretty
excited.\\
546 - Yes.\\
547 - Oh, dear.\\
548 - Oh!\\
549 - Well, I guess we can all go back to
our seats\\
550 - and see the rest of the show.\\
551 - Why don't you go in?\\
552 - I'm tired of sitting four in two
seats.\\
553 - Oh, come on, honey, it's not so bad.\\
554 - No, come on, Rick.\\
555 - Uh, uh, just a moment.\\
556 - Did you say four in two seats?\\
557 - Oh, yes, yes. There was a ticket
mix-up, you see,\\
558 - so the four of us are sharing two
seats.\\
559 - Oh, well, I'm sorry.\\
560 - Oh, that's all right.
We don't mind.\\
561 - Uh-uh-uh-uh. Now...\\
562 - ...if four people have been watching
the show,\\
563 - then you've got to pay for four.\\
564 - Oh, well, yeah... no, no, that's not
quite right.\\
565 - You don't understand.\\
566 - You see, the four of us didn't watch
the show.\\
567 - No.\\
568 - Actually, we didn't even see the
first half at all.\\
569 - No, we saw the first half.\\
570 - Then we came in the second half,\\
571 - Yeah.
and we hardly have seen any part of
that\\
572 - when all this happened.\\
573 - Besides that, you know,\\
574 - we bought four tickets for the
matinee,\\
575 - which nobody used at all.\\
576 - No.\\
577 - Then I bought two more tonight,\\
578 - so I really bought six tickets
altogether.\\
579 - Yeah. So, you really owe us for two.\\
580 - Look, rules are rules.\\
581 - If four people are watching the show,\\
582 - then four have got to pay.\\
583 - Ah.\\
584 - Well, I guess that's...\\
585 - I'll get it, Fred.
That's all right.\\
586 - There.
Oh, thanks.\\
587 - That'll do it.
Thank you.\\
588 - Eight tickets already.
Yeah.\\
589 - Well...
Well, come on.\\
590 - Let's go see the rest of the show.\\
591 - All right, Fred.\\
592 - Oh, no, the show's over.\\
593 - Oh, no!\\
594 - How did it come out?
\subsection {Episode 23: Housewarming (1957)}
1 - How you doing, Fred?\\
2 - Well, I got the unit installed over
at our house.\\
3 - Now it's just a matter of connecting
this\\
4 - and the one up in little Ricky's room\\
5 - and the intercom's all set.\\
6 - Fred, are you sure you know what
you're doing\\
7 - with all those little wires and
things?\\
8 - Do I know what I'm doing?\\
9 - I'll have you know I'm the Thomas A.
Edison of today.\\
10 - Hmm-hmm. Yeah, but do you know what
you're doing?\\
11 - Look, name one time when I ever
botched an electrical job.\\
12 - All right. How about the time you
tried to rewire your kitchen\\
13 - and the whole East Side of New York
was dark for 48 hours?\\
14 - Was it my fault that all that wiring
was 20 years old?\\
15 - I'll bet you can't name another one.\\
16 - All right. How about the time you
tried to fix our TV set\\
17 - and the picture tube exploded and
burned a hole in the rug?\\
18 - And how about the time you...\\
19 - Do you want this thing set up or not?\\
20 - Yes, Fred, I'd love to have it set
up.\\
21 - I just want to make sure you know
what you're doing.\\
22 - That's all.
I know what I'm doing.\\
23 - Okay.
All right.\\
24 - Hi, sweetheart.\\
25 - Hi, Mommy.\\
26 - What's Uncle Fred doing?\\
27 - Oh, he's setting up an intercom
system.\\
28 - What's an intercom system?\\
29 - Well, it's kind of like a telephone.\\
30 - See, Aunt Ethel has another gadget
like that in her place,\\
31 - and she and Mommy can talk to each
other.\\
32 - Is it better than a telephone?\\
33 - It's cheaper.\\
34 - Oh, is that good?\\
35 - Is that good?\\
36 - I'll have to have a talk with this
lad.\\
37 - What's that one for?\\
38 - Well, that's for your room, honey,\\
39 - Oh, good. I want to talk to Ethel.\\
40 - Hi, Ethel!
How are you, girl?\\
41 - Hello, there.\\
42 - Uh, Ethel?\\
43 - Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.\\
44 - What?\\
45 - When you want to talk to Ethel,
just... turn that knob.\\
46 - Oh. Hello, Ethel!
How are you?\\
47 - Hi, Ethel!\\
48 - Testing, one, two, three.\\
49 - Testing, one two, three.\\
50 - Hello, Lucy, is that you?\\
51 - Yeah.\\
52 - Isn't this exciting?
Yeah.\\
53 - It's just like a telephone,\\
54 - only we can talk to each other\\
55 - whenever we want to and all we...\\
56 - That's the way to turn it off.\\
57 - That's the best part of it.\\
58 - Oh, now, Fred.\\
59 - Hey, Ethel?\\
60 - Yeah?\\
61 - You want to do me some...\\
62 - You want to go out to the henhouse\\
63 - get a dozen fresh eggs\\
64 - and bring them over right away?\\
65 - Sure.
Thank you.\\
66 - Now, when you get through talking,\\
67 - don't forget to turn it off.\\
68 - Oh, okay.\\
69 - Ricky, you almost ready for
breakfast?\\
70 - In a few minutes, dear.\\
71 - I'm getting out of the shower.\\
72 - Okay.
Where do you want to put\\
73 - the speaker in Little Ricky's room?\\
74 - Well, on the nightstand, I guess,
would be fine.\\
75 - Okay.		 Can I help, Uncle
Fred?\\
76 - Sure, you can help, partner.\\
77 - Come on.\\
78 - Can I talk to outer space through
this?\\
79 - Outer space?\\
80 - Well, I guess you can.\\
81 - But they may not answer.\\
82 - Oh, boy, I'm going to say hello to
the moon.\\
83 - Say hello to the moon?\\
84 - All right, come on.\\
85 - We'll try it.\\
86 - We'll say hello to everybody.
Get up there.\\
87 - Hi.\\
88 - Hi, dear.\\
89 - I'll just put your eggs in the
frigidaire.\\
90 - Oh, don't bother, honey.\\
91 - I've to take them over to Betty
Ramsey's right away.\\
92 - She's making a cake for the dinner
tonight.\\
93 - What dinner?\\
94 - Oh, she's having the neighbors over.\\
95 - Oh, that's wonderful!\\
96 - Gee, my good dress is at the
cleaners, but I think if I\\
97 - called them up, they'd deliver it\\
98 - in time for the dinner party.\\
99 - Uh, Ethel...\\
100 - Huh?\\
101 - She's just having the Munsons\\
102 - and the Baileys and Ricky and me.\\
103 - Oh?\\
104 - Well, you know, it's just the
neighbors that live real close.\\
105 - Oh, just the close ones, huh?\\
106 - Yeah.\\
107 - I see. The Baileys live four miles
away\\
108 - and we live four feet away.\\
109 - Oh, now, honey, there's no reason\\
110 - to feel funny about it.\\
111 - She just doesn't know you very well.\\
112 - Well, that's true.\\
113 - People like the Ramseys don't hobnob
much\\
114 - with us chicken pluckers.\\
115 - Chicken pluckers?\\
116 - Oh, Ethel, for heaven's sake.\\
117 - What a thing to say.\\
118 - Now, look, we're all in the egg
business together.\\
119 - If you're chicken pluckers, we're
chicken pluckers.\\
120 - Then how come us chicken pluckers\\
121 - weren't invited to the dinner party?\\
122 - Well, she just doesn't know you
chicken pluckers...\\
123 - I mean, she doesn't know you and Fred
as well, that's all.\\
124 - Now, look, honey, I'm sure\\
125 - when she gets to know you a little
better\\
126 - she'll ask you to one of her parties.\\
127 - I couldn't care less.\\
128 - I wouldn't go to a party given by
that snob if she begged me.\\
129 - Oh, honey, now, you got Betty all
wrong.\\
130 - Here are the eggs for your friend.\\
131 - And I hope her cake falls.\\
132 - Oh, Ethel, for heaven's sake.\\
133 - Oh...\\
134 - Hi, honey.\\
135 - Morning, dear.\\
136 - Oh, I see Fred connected the
intercom, huh?\\
137 - Yeah.\\
138 - How do you work it?\\
139 - Like this.\\
140 - Oh.\\
141 - He's putting one in Little Ricky's
room now.\\
142 - What's the matter with you?\\
143 - Oh, Ethel's all upset because they
weren't asked\\
144 - to the Ramsey's dinner party tonight.\\
145 - That's nothing to be upset about.\\
146 - Well, that's what I told her, but it
didn't do any good.\\
147 - She still feels left out\\
148 - If I didn't know better,\\
149 - I'd think she was jealous of my
friendship with Betty Ramsey.\\
150 - Oh, honey, that's ridiculous.\\
151 - Well, I don't know.\\
152 - You know what the trouble is.\\
153 - It's hard for the Mertzes to meet
people out here.\\
154 - You know, you have your work, I have
my PTA Club activities,\\
155 - but the Mertzes don't have any
friends in the country.\\
156 - We didn't have
any friends in the city either.\\
157 - Now turn off your switch.\\
158 - Yeah.\\
159 - Where is he?\\
160 - He just connected the speaker in
Little Ricky's room.\\
161 - Oh.\\
162 - You know, with that thin' around,\\
163 - you gotta be careful what you say.\\
164 - Yeah, that's right.\\
165 - Honey, I feel so guilty about the
Mertzes.\\
166 - Well, it's not your fault, dear.\\
167 - Well, yes, honey, in a way, it is.\\
168 - You know, they wouldn't be living out
here at all\\
169 - if it wasn't for us.\\
170 - Well, everything will work out all
right.\\
171 - I don't know. I have never seen Ethel
so upset.\\
172 - She acted like she'd lost her best
friend.\\
173 - Good grief!\\
174 - I guess she thinks she has.\\
175 - Oh, now, honey, you're exaggerating.\\
176 - No, I'm not. You know, Betty and
Ethel have only met once.\\
177 - I'll bet if they got to know each
other, they'd be friends.\\
178 - Well, why don't you bring them
together?\\
179 - That's a good idea.\\
180 - I'm gonna have the two of them over
here for lunch tomorrow.\\
181 - Fine. Then it's all settled.\\
182 - Hmm. Now, what'll I serve for lunch?\\
183 - How about breakfast?\\
184 - Who ever heard of serving breakfast
for lunch?\\
185 - Oh, your breakfast!\\
186 - Yeah.
Oh, honey, yes, sir!\\
187 - Hi, Ethel.\\
188 - Hello.\\
189 - What's the big formal occasion\\
190 - inviting me to luncheon?\\
191 - Well, I thought it'd be fun\\
192 - to have a fancy girl-type luncheon,\\
193 - you know, like we used to have at
Schrafts in New York.\\
194 - Who else is coming?\\
195 - Lucy, what are you up to?\\
196 - What do you mean what am I up to?\\
197 - Now, don't tell me you've invited
Betty Ramsey,\\
198 - the Elsa Maxwell of Westport, to
lunch, too.\\
199 - I gotta get the mints.\\
200 - Now, Lucy...\\
201 - Oh, hi, Ethel!\\
202 - Hello.\\
203 - Well, where's our hostess?\\
204 - She's in the kitchen.\\
205 - Hi, Betty!
Hi, dear.\\
206 - How are you, dear?\\
207 - Wonderful.\\
208 - How's Ralph?
Fine.\\
209 - He's still on the trip.\\
210 - Oh, is he really?
I didn't know that.\\
211 - Listen, lunch is all ready, so why
don't we sit down.\\
212 - Oh, good.
I'm starved.\\
213 - Sit right here, dear.\\
214 - Thank you.\\
215 - Right there, dear.\\
216 - Oh, it looks wonderful, Lucy.\\
217 - Good.\\
218 - Lucy, I must tell you\\
219 - I love that dinner dress\\
220 - you had on last night.\\
221 - Oh, well, thank you.\\
222 - It's real old, but it's my favorite,\\
223 - so I just keep on wearing it and
wearing it.\\
224 - Oh, yes, I know.
I do the same thing.\\
225 - I get a dinner dress I like and I
wear it to death, too.\\
226 - You're the same way, aren't you,
dear?\\
227 - Oh, yes, every night when Fred and I
have dinner\\
228 - in front of our TV set, I wear the
same old flannel bathrobe.\\
229 - Oh, she's a funny one.\\
230 - You know, when you get to know Ethel
better,\\
231 - you will find that she's more fun
than a barrel of monkeys.\\
232 - Monkeys that seldom get invited out
of their barrel, that is.\\
233 - There she goes again.\\
234 - Oh, Lucy, I was so flattered.\\
235 - Kay Bailey asked me for the recipe
for my cake last night.\\
236 - Did she?
Yes, she did.\\
237 - I told her the secret were your fresh
eggs.\\
238 - Oh, well, thank you.\\
239 - You know, we're in the egg business
together,\\
240 - so half of those belong to Ethel.\\
241 - Isn't that right, dear?\\
242 - Yes, the shells.\\
243 - That reminds me.\\
244 - Did you notice my new
eggshell-colored cushions?\\
245 - Yes, I saw them yesterday.\\
246 - They're just right for that couch.\\
247 - Oh, I'm glad you like them.\\
248 - As a matter of fact, your house
really looks lovely.\\
249 - Just lovely.\\
250 - Thanks to you.\\
251 - Now that you've got it all fixed up,\\
252 - we'll have to have a housewarming
party.\\
253 - Mm, oh, I would love that!\\
254 - Oh, yeah, let's see.
We'll have, uh, the Baileys,\\
255 - Bill and June Spear, the Munsons,\\
256 - the Parkers...\\
257 - And the Mertzes.\\
258 - Oh, yes, and the Mertzes.\\
259 - I'm afraid we can't make it.\\
260 - Oh, that's a shame.\\
261 - Now, dear, we haven't even set the
date yet.\\
262 - Oh, but we're booked up months ahead.\\
263 - There's the, uh, Hired-Hands
Convention\\
264 - and, uh,\\
265 - the Poultry Growers Annual Ball...\\
266 - and the Baby-Sitters Amalgamated...\\
267 - Dear, dear, dear...\\
268 - why don't we wait until we set the
date.\\
269 - I'm sure you'll be able to work
something out.\\
270 - Oh, yes, it'd be such fun.\\
271 - I love parties.\\
272 - I've loved parties since I was a
little girl.\\
273 - So have I.\\
274 - And so have you, haven't you, dear?\\
275 - I haven't been to a party since I was
a little girl.\\
276 - Thank you.\\
277 - I have sufficient.\\
278 - Speaking of being a little girl,\\
279 - you should hear about\\
280 - the fascinating childhood that Ethel
has had.\\
281 - You know, she was raised\\
282 - on a ranch outside of Albuquerque,\\
283 - and I want to tell you...\\
284 - Albuquerque?
Is that where you're from?\\
285 - Mm-hmm.\\
286 - For heaven's sake, that's my
hometown.\\
287 - Oh, really?\\
288 - I was born there.\\
289 - No kidding?\\
290 - I was born there, too.\\
291 - Well, what a wonderful coincidence!\\
292 - Isn't it a small world?\\
293 - What was your name before it was
Mertz?\\
294 - Potter? What was yours?\\
295 - Foster.\\
296 - Not the Leslie Fosters?\\
297 - Leslie's my father.\\
298 - Well, Will Potter is my father.\\
299 - Oh, no!\\
300 - They belonged to the same lodge.\\
301 - I'm from Jamestown.\\
302 - Oh, my goodness, it certainly is a
small world.\\
303 - So you're Ethel Potter.\\
304 - And you were Betty Foster.\\
305 - I was Lucy McGillicuddy.\\
306 - Oh, I remember, your family moved
away\\
307 - when you were just a little girl.\\
308 - Yes, that's right.
I was just nine years old.\\
309 - Just nine years old.\\
310 - I lived in Jamestown till I was 17.\\
311 - Why didn't you tell me you were from
Albuquerque?\\
312 - Me? Why didn't you mention you were
from Albuquerque?\\
313 - Ethel Potter!\\
314 - Betty Foster!\\
315 - Lucy.\\
316 - What?! Yes?\\
317 - Why don't you get Little Ethel Potter
and me\\
318 - another cup of coffee?\\
319 - I tell you.\\
320 - Oh, I should have known you were from
Albuquerque.\\
321 - You're so warm and friendly.\\
322 - Uh, Betty, dear, uh, uh, Yes?\\
323 - I just love the way you did Lucy's
house over for her.\\
324 - Would you mind doing the same thing
for me?\\
325 - Do my house over?\\
326 - Oh, you know I'd love it.\\
327 - Where'd you go to school?\\
328 - Albuquerque Elementary.\\
329 - So did I.\\
330 - Strawberry shortcake, gooseberry pie\\
331 - V-i-c-t-o-r-y.\\
332 - Will we win...\\
333 - Betty, it's Lucy.
Listen, I thought\\
334 - I'd like to browse around\\
335 - some of the local antique shops
today.\\
336 - Want to go with me?\\
337 - Oh.\\
338 - Uh-huh.\\
339 - Well, maybe some other time, then,
dear.\\
340 - Okay, bye.\\
341 - What's the matter, can't she go?\\
342 - No, she's going into New York today.\\
343 - What do you mean, you want $40
for a lamp?\\
344 - It's what I said.\\
345 - We don't have a decent lamp to read
by.\\
346 - Listen, Ethel,\\
347 - if you want to read, you can read by
firelight.\\
348 - If it was good enough for
Abraham Lincoln,\\
349 - it's good enough for you.\\
350 - Oh, don't drag in your boyhood
pals, Fred.\\
351 - Hey, listen, you two, stop your
arguing.\\
352 - I'm on the intercom.\\
353 - Who's arguing?\\
354 - This is the way we always talk.\\
355 - Oh, Fred.\\
356 - Listen, Ethel, you want to go
antiquing with me today?\\
357 - Oh, I can't. I'm going into New York\\
358 - with Betty to look at lamps and
stuff.\\
359 - Oh.\\
360 - But thanks anyway.\\
361 - Yeah.\\
362 - What's the matter, honey?\\
363 - Betty and Ethel are going into New
York together.\\
364 - So what?\\
365 - So, yesterday they went to New Canaan\\
366 - to visit a mutual friend from
Albuquerque.\\
367 - Yeah.\\
368 - The day before that,\\
369 - Ethel took Betty to the market with
her.\\
370 - Ever since they had lunch here,
they've been thick as thieves.\\
371 - Well, you wanted them to be friends.\\
372 - Yeah, I want them to be friends.\\
373 - So everything is working out fine.\\
374 - Yeah, everything is working out fine.\\
375 - What's so hot all of a sudden about
being born in Albuquerque?\\
376 - What?\\
377 - I could have been born there myself\\
378 - if my family hadn't lived in
Jamestown.\\
379 - Why, Lucy, I think you're jealous.\\
380 - Jealous?\\
381 - Ha!\\
382 - You're acting jealous.\\
383 - Not in the least.\\
384 - Look, if a person brings her two best
friends together\\
385 - so that they can become friends\\
386 - and those two friends become friends\\
387 - and then they choose to ignore the
friend\\
388 - who brought them together in the
first place,\\
389 - then those friends are no longer
friends of mine.\\
390 - Why, honey, you don't mean that.\\
391 - I certainly do, too,\\
392 - and I don't care if I never speak to
them again in my life!\\
393 - What's the matter now?\\
394 - My two best friends just went by arm
in arm.\\
395 - I still don't believe it.\\
396 - I did, too.\\
397 - I talked to the moon last night.\\
398 - Did they answer?\\
399 - No, but maybe they will today.\\
400 - Okay, let's try it.\\
401 - You know, Ethel, maybe you
could use a lamp\\
402 - like we have in our den.\\
403 - I could bring it over tonight and see
what it looks like.\\
404 - And the next time we go into New
York,\\
405 - I could get you one just like it.\\
406 - Oh, that'd be great!\\
407 - Would you tell me if you think\\
408 - I should wallpaper the halls?\\
409 - Sure. Let's go look at it.\\
410 - That isn't the moon That's my mommy.\\
411 - Maybe your mommy's on the moon.\\
412 - No, she's with your Aunt Ethel.\\
413 - Got some cookies I'm hungry?\\
414 - Yeah. Come on!\\
415 - Glad you liked the idea of the
wallpaper.\\
416 - But maybe I ought to ask Lucy what
she thinks.\\
417 - After all, she owns this house.\\
418 - By the way, Ethel,\\
419 - Lucy's been acting so strange lately.\\
420 - If I didn't know better,\\
421 - I'd think she was jealous of our
friendship.\\
422 - Oh, why should she be jealous?\\
423 - She's the one who brought us
together.\\
424 - Well, I just can't figure her out.\\
425 - When you've known Lucy as long as I
have,\\
426 - you won't try to figure her out.\\
427 - Ethel, I have a little housewarming
gift\\
428 - for you here.\\
429 - A housewarming gift!
Why, thanks.\\
430 - But, uh, since Lucy's been acting so
funny,\\
431 - I don't think you ought to tell her I
bought it for you.\\
432 - Okay.\\
433 - Go, ahead, open it.\\
434 - What's that, Ethel?\\
435 - It's a housewarming gift.\\
436 - But whatever you do, don't tell Lucy.\\
437 - Oh, all right.\\
438 - Well, I've got to run now.\\
439 - Don't forget tonight, Ethel.\\
440 - Don't worry, Betty, I won't.\\
441 - Honey, I have been such a fool.\\
442 - What do you mean, dear?\\
443 - Oh, you know, I was kind of upset
about Betty and Ethel\\
444 - seeing so much of each other, but...\\
445 - Do you know what those two little
dears been up to?\\
446 - What?
They're giving us\\
447 - a surprise housewarming party
tonight.\\
448 - They are?
Yeah.\\
449 - How do you know?\\
450 - I just heard them on the intercom.\\
451 - And, you know, they were looking\\
452 - at a housewarming gift for us,\\
453 - and Ethel told Fred not to tell me
about it.\\
454 - You see, honey, and you were jealous.\\
455 - Jealous?\\
456 - Oh, What in the world are you talking
about?\\
457 - How could I possibly be jealous of my
two very best friends?\\
458 - Oh, honey.\\
459 - Oh, jealous, never, never.\\
460 - Honey, I-I still say that we're too
dressed up.\\
461 - They'll know that we're expecting
them.\\
462 - Now, honey, if I'm gonna be
surprised,\\
463 - I want to be surprised in my best
dress.\\
464 - Won't they be suspicious?\\
465 - We never dress like this when we
spend an evening alone.\\
466 - Well, how do they know?\\
467 - They're never with us\\
468 - when we spend an evening alone.\\
469 - Well, there you got me.\\
470 - Well, I don't know.\\
471 - It's after 9:00.\\
472 - Are you sure the party's tonight?\\
473 - Of course, dear.\\
474 - Well, where are they?\\
475 - Well, they're probably gathering\\
476 - over at the Mertzes, you know,\\
477 - and they all want to come over
together.\\
478 - Oh.\\
479 - What are you doing?\\
480 - Oh.\\
481 - I was practicing looking surprised.\\
482 - Oh.\\
483 - I don't want to spoil their fun.\\
484 - You ought to do it, too.\\
485 - You ought to try it.
Go ahead.\\
486 - Try it.
Try what?\\
487 - Try looking surprised.\\
488 - Oh, honey, it's a surprise party, not
a holdup.\\
489 - Don't pop your eyes out like that.\\
490 - I can't help it.\\
491 - When I'm surprised, my eyes pop out.\\
492 - Well, not so far, then.
You looked like\\
493 - you just stuck your finger in a light
socket.\\
494 - Come on, let's have a dress rehearsal
at the door.\\
495 - A dress rehearsal?\\
496 - Yeah. We're gonna practice looking
surprised, see?\\
497 - I'll go outside and rap,\\
498 - and then when I come in, you look
surprised, see?\\
499 - Okay, let's try it.\\
500 - This girl.\\
501 - Surprise!\\
502 - Honey, that is not a look of
surprise.\\
503 - Yes, it is.\\
504 - I'll be surprised if my ribs aren't
broken.\\
505 - Oh, now...\\
506 - Come on now, you go out.\\
507 - Go ahead, honey.\\
508 - Now you surprise me.\\
509 - Come in.\\
510 - Surprise!\\
511 - Surprise!\\
512 - I thought I was supposed to surprise
you.\\
513 - Well, honey, I'm sorry.
but, you know, sometimes\\
514 - the guests come in and hide while the
people are out\\
515 - and then when they come home,\\
516 - they jump out and surprise them...\\
517 - I'll bet that's why they're not here.\\
518 - They're waiting for us to got out\\
519 - so that they can come in here and
hide.\\
520 - Hey, you get our coats.\\
521 - Where are you going?\\
522 - Just get our coats.\\
523 - Ethel?\\
524 - Yeah?\\
525 - Ethel, dear, we're going into town
for about 20 minutes.\\
526 - Would, uh, you leave the intercom
open\\
527 - so you can hear Little Ricky?\\
528 - Okay.\\
529 - Okay, dear, remember we'll be back in
20 minutes.\\
530 - Okay. Gee, it's lucky you caught me.\\
531 - I was just getting ready to go to
bed.\\
532 - Oh? Oh. Uh-huh.\\
533 - She's waiting for us to
go out.\\
534 - Well, we're home.\\
535 - Yep, here we are.\\
536 - So hang up my coat...\\
537 - Well, we're home.\\
538 - Yep, here we are.\\
539 - Dee-da dee-da-do\\
540 - It's so nice to be home...\\
541 - Want something to eat, dear?\\
542 - Yes, yes.
Okay.\\
543 - Let's go in the kitchen, have
something to eat.\\
544 - Okay.\\
545 - Well, you must have been wrong,
honey.\\
546 - I don't think anybody's giving us a
party tonight.\\
547 - Yes, they are, dear-- I heard them on
the intercom.\\
548 - Well, you must have misunderstood,
honey.\\
549 - They wouldn't wait this long\\
550 - if they were gonna give us a party.\\
551 - Oh, now, they might.\\
552 - You know, just to throw us off the
track.\\
553 - That Ethel's a sly one, you know.\\
554 - She just might wait this long\\
555 - so it'd be so late that we'd just...\\
556 - You're right, we're not having any
party.\\
557 - You don't have to cry\\
558 - because we're not having a party.\\
559 - I'm not crying because we're not
having a party.\\
560 - I'm crying because we don't have any
friends.\\
561 - Oh, now, of course, we've got
friends.\\
562 - No, we haven't.\\
563 - Sure, they're good friends of yours.\\
564 - Come on, let's go to bed.\\
565 - I don't want to go to bed!\\
566 - Fred! Fred!\\
567 - Come down here quick!\\
568 - Hurry up, Fred!\\
569 - Oh, dear.\\
570 - What's the matter?\\
571 - What's going on?\\
572 - Oh, Fred, I just heard\\
573 - Lucy and Ricky talking on the
intercom,\\
574 - and they think we're having a
surprise housewarming party\\
575 - for them tonight.\\
576 - Where'd they get that idea?\\
577 - Well, I don't know, but we gotta do
something.\\
578 - I don't know what you're gonna do,\\
579 - but I'm going back to bed.\\
580 - Oh, now, Fred, those poor little
things,\\
581 - they're sitting over there,\\
582 - thinking they haven't got a friend in
the world.\\
583 - What time is it?
10:00.\\
584 - They haven't.\\
585 - Fred, now, we've got to do something.\\
586 - Uh, here.
Wrap that as a gift.\\
587 - Wrap that as a gift.\\
588 - I'll call Betty Ramsey\\
589 - and have her round up a lot of the
neighbors\\
590 - and we'll give them a party.\\
591 - Oh, brother, there goes my beauty
sleep.\\
592 - Coming.\\
593 - Surprise!\\
594 - Oh, am I surprised.\\
595 - You think you're surprised!\\
596 - Happy housewarming!\\
597 - You didn't have any idea.\\
598 - Oh, no, I certainly...\\
599 - Oh, honestly...\\
600 - Happy housewarming.\\
601 - Oh, honey!\\
602 - That's a present to you from me.\\
603 - Oh, oh, boy...\\
604 - Oh, you shouldn't have.\\
605 - Hey, I gave you one just like that.\\
606 - Oh, well, now, that's funny.\\
607 - Well, now we've each got one.
Yeah.\\
608 - Come on, are we gonna have this party
or not?!\\
609 - Everybody, make yourselves at home.\\
610 - I'll get some ice.\\
611 - Take off your coat, Fred.\\
612 - Take your coat off, Fred.\\
613 - Come on, Fred, take your coat off.\\
614 - Ethel.\\
615 - Fred!\\
616 - I thought you told me this was a
slumber party.\\
617 - Here again are Lucille
Ball and Desi Arnaz\\
618 - for our alternate sponsors.\\
619 - Listen, honey, tonight I gotta tell
the ladies\\

1 - Hurry up, Ricky!\\
2 - You'll be late for work.\\
3 - Good-bye, honey.
You got five minutes\\
4 - to get to the station.
Bye-bye.\\
5 - Hi, honey.\\
6 - Oh, hi.\\
7 - How's Ricky enjoying his vacation?\\
8 - Oh...\\
9 - vacation!\\
10 - Honey, could you move down a little?\\
11 - Where you going to sweep next?\\
12 - I'm all through.\\
13 - Good.\\
14 - Why don't you come over and talk to
me, honey?\\
15 - Talk?\\
16 - Sure, you don't have to do\\
17 - all that dustin' and swipin' now.\\
18 - Well, I'm afraid I do, dear.\\
19 - The house gets pretty dirty\\
20 - if I don't do my "dustin' and
swippin'" every day.\\
21 - Honey?\\
22 - Yeah.\\
23 - You missed a spot here.\\
24 - Right along the edge there, see?\\
25 - Right along that edge there.\\
26 - Thanks.\\
27 - Look, honey, this is your vacation.\\
28 - Wouldn't you like to be doing
something?\\
29 - No, no, I just want to sit here and
relax.\\
30 - Psst.\\
31 - Top of the picture there.\\
32 - Honey, why don't you call up little
Freddie Mertz\\
33 - and ask him to come over and play
with you?\\
34 - You know Fred isn't in town for the
morning.\\
35 - Oh.
He's in New York, remember?\\
36 - Yeah.\\
37 - A piece of lint.\\
38 - You must have missed it with the
carpet sweeper.\\
39 - Thank you very much.\\
40 - What do you want me to do with it?\\
41 - Why don't you get yourself a
scrapbook\\
42 - and start a lint collection?\\
43 - Look, honey, why don't you go for a
walk\\
44 - or go out to the village\\
45 - or go out and talk to the chickens or
something?\\
46 - No, I don't want to do anything.\\
47 - This is my vacation.\\
48 - I just want to sit here and relax.\\
49 - How comes there's no cigarette in the
cigarette box?\\
50 - Well, I haven't had time to fill them
yet this morning, dear.\\
51 - There's a whole drawerful\\
52 - in the kitchen.
Oh, thank you.\\
53 - Whew, a whole week with the Cuban
Kibitzer.\\
54 - You say something?\\
55 - A whole drawerful in the kitchen,
dear.\\
56 - Cigarettes...
Oh.\\
57 - ...loaded with them.\\
58 - Lucy?\\
59 - What?\\
60 - What's the meaning of this?\\
61 - What's the meaning of this?\\
62 - Yes.\\
63 - Well, this is my wedding ring.\\
64 - It means that we're married.\\
65 - It means you're my husband, I'm
you're wife\\
66 - and we have a child by this union.\\
67 - I know all of that.
Oh.\\
68 - What is it doing in the windowsill\\
69 - on top of the kitchen sink?\\
70 - Well, that's where I put it every
morning.\\
71 - You see, every morning after
breakfast\\
72 - I take it off, I put it on the
windowsill.\\
73 - Then I wash the dishes.\\
74 - Then I come in here, and I do my
housework.\\
75 - I go back into the kitchen,\\
76 - I take it off the windowsill\\
77 - and put it back on my finger.\\
78 - Mm-hmm. Well, that's the easiest way
in the world\\
79 - to lose your wedding ring.\\
80 - Well, I've been doing it for 16
years,\\
81 - and I haven't lost it yet.\\
82 - Why you have to take it off?\\
83 - Because dishwater is very hard\\
84 - on diamond rings.\\
85 - When we got married\\
86 - you said you will never take your
ring off.\\
87 - When we got married, you said\\
88 - that dishwater would never touch\\
89 - these lily white hands.\\
90 - Well, I bought you\\
91 - a pair of rubber gloves, didn't I?\\
92 - Right.
That's the easiest way to lose a ring\\
93 - is to take it off and leave it
someplace.\\
94 - You forgot you put it there...\\
95 - Look, Ricky...
and then you lose it...\\
96 - ...I don't know if you realize it or
not,\\
97 - but ever since you started your
vacation\\
98 - you've done nothing but pick on me
and criticize.\\
99 - Daddy...\\
100 - let's fly my new kite.\\
101 - Yeah, go fly a kite.\\
102 - All right, son.\\
103 - Come on.\\
104 - Hi, honey.\\
105 - Oh, hi.\\
106 - What are you doing?\\
107 - Trying to keep Ricky out of my hair.\\
108 - What do you mean?\\
109 - Oh, I don't know what I'm gonna do\\
110 - with him home for a whole week.\\
111 - He's driving me crazy.\\
112 - Oh, now you know how I feel every
week.\\
113 - I'm going to have to cook up a
project\\
114 - to keep him occupied.\\
115 - A project, huh?\\
116 - Yeah.\\
117 - Well, how about that barbecue\\
118 - he and Fred are planning to build out
on the patio?\\
119 - Gee, I don't know.
That sounds like work.\\
120 - All he wants to do is sit around and
relax.\\
121 - I don't know how I'd get him to build
a barbecue.\\
122 - Why don't you use the method I always
use\\
123 - when I want Fred to do something?\\
124 - What's that?\\
125 - Well, I start the project myself, and
then Fred sees me\\
126 - and he says, "Ethel, that's not the
way to do that."\\
127 - And then he goes ahead and does it
himself.\\
128 - Ethel, you're getting to be a pretty
tricky thinker.\\
129 - Well, I've been around the old master
for so long,\\
130 - I guess some of you has rubbed off on
me.\\
131 - Well, Ethel, I guess we're
ready to build the old barbecue now.\\
132 - Yeah, we've never built one before,\\
133 - but let's give it a try.\\
134 - Yeah.\\
135 - I don't think he heard us.\\
136 - Make a lot of noise.\\
137 - Here he comes. Here he...
Uh, guess you better\\
138 - put the cement in there, Ethel.\\
139 - Might as well look like\\
140 - we're starting, anyway.
Oh, okay.\\
141 - We're probably gonna need a lot more\\
142 - cement, too, don't you think?\\
143 - Yep. Got all the cement in there.\\
144 - Got plenty of bricks though, I think.\\
145 - Yeah. We may need...\\
146 - What are you doing?
What are you doing?\\
147 - Oh, we're building the barbecue,
dear.\\
148 - Wait a minute. Fred and I are gonna
do that next month.\\
149 - Oh, I know, but the weather's so
warm,\\
150 - we got kind of anxious to have it
built,\\
151 - so Ethel and I thought we'd just go
ahead and do it.\\
152 - Yeah, just because we've never built
one before\\
153 - doesn't mean we can't build this one.\\
154 - No. Now here's where I thought we'd
put it, Ethel.\\
155 - Right over here. This seems like the
best place, see?\\
156 - Yeah.
And then I figure\\
157 - that the grill should be up, say,
about that high,\\
158 - to keep the smoke out of our eyes.\\
159 - Now, won't that make it kind of
awkward for cooking?\\
160 - Well, we'll get a little stepladder
and stand on that.\\
161 - Oh, a stepladder, sure.\\
162 - Wait, a minute.
Where are the blueprints?\\
163 - Blueprints?\\
164 - The plans.\\
165 - Oh, who needs plans?\\
166 - We'll just create as we go along.\\
167 - Yeah, we thought we'd just ad-lib
this barbecue.\\
168 - Yeah.
Now, just a minute, girls, just a
minute.\\
169 - It is very obvious that you don't
know what you're doing.\\
170 - I better do this job myself.\\
171 - Well, Ethel, I guess that's right.\\
172 - I guess they do know more about it
than we do.\\
173 - Yeah, building a barbecue\\
174 - - is man's work.
- Yeah.\\
175 - Well, let us know how you're doing,
dear.\\
176 - Hold on, I'll need some help.\\
177 - Help?\\
178 - Help?\\
179 - Yeah, sure, while I'm doing the
brickwork\\
180 - you two can be mixing the cement,\\
181 - so pour the water in there and get
going.\\
182 - I'll go get the blueprints.\\
183 - Well, you pour the water right in
there.\\
184 - That's what he said.\\
185 - I know what he said.\\
186 - Doesn't seem to be mixing together
very well.\\
187 - Maybe we're supposed to help it
along.\\
188 - Oh.\\
189 - Well, all right.\\
190 - Oh, my ring.\\
191 - Oh...\\
192 - Well, don't just stand there.\\
193 - Come on.\\
194 - Oh, Lucy.\\
195 - Eww.\\
196 - What are you doing now?\\
197 - Mixing the cement, like you told us
to.\\
198 - You're not supposed to put your hands
in there.\\
199 - You're supposed to mix it with that
hoe over there.\\
200 - Now he tells us.\\
201 - Hey.
Hi, Fred! Hi!\\
202 - Oh, hi, Fred.\\
203 - Hi.\\
204 - What in Sam Hill's going on around
here?\\
205 - Well, we're going to build the
barbecue.\\
206 - I thought we were going to do that
next month.\\
207 - I know, but the weather got so nice,\\
208 - we thought we'd start right away.\\
209 - Well, then, I'll go and put on my
working clothes\\
210 - and come back and help you.
Thank you.\\
211 - You're welcome.\\
212 - Okay, Fred.
All right.\\
213 - Well, as long as you have Fred to
help you,\\
214 - guess you won't be needing us, dear.\\
215 - No, we'll just go on in the house.\\
216 - Now, just a minute.
Just a minute.\\
217 - For a job like that, it's very good
to have some helpers.\\
218 - Uh, you can mix the cement and hand
us\\
219 - the brick while we're doing the work.\\
220 - Now, go on, get going, mix the
cement.\\
221 - And put some more water in there,
Ethel.\\
222 - Lucy, you pile all these bricks over
there\\
223 - in a nice... little nice pile over
there.\\
224 - All the bricks over there.\\
225 - Nice and neat.\\
226 - Keep it moving, Ethel.\\
227 - Yes, sir.\\
228 - Hurry up, honey.\\
229 - Well, Fred, how about it, huh?\\
230 - Well, if I do say so myself, it looks
pretty good.\\
231 - Pretty good?\\
232 - Why, it's a work of art.\\
233 - I hope the gals got dinner ready.\\
234 - I'm starved.\\
235 - Yeah, me, too.\\
236 - Well, we get...\\
237 - Ay, mira que tiene cosa,\\
238 - la mujer esta...
What's wrong, what's wrong?\\
239 - Oh, Lucy-- I never seen anyone as
careless as she is.\\
240 - Look where she left her ring.\\
241 - Well, that's one problem I'll never
have with Ethel.\\
242 - She's careful, huh?\\
243 - No, her fingers have gotten so fat\\
244 - she can't get her ring off.\\
245 - You know what I got a notion to do?
No.\\
246 - I'm going to hide this ring in my
pocket.\\
247 - Oh?
And let's see how long\\
248 - it takes her to find out that it's
missing.\\
249 - Surprise!\\
250 - - Hi!
- Surprise. Hi!\\
251 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no!\\
252 - Honey, don't put it there.\\
253 - That's still wet, dear.
That's still wet.\\
254 - Don't do that.
Oh, I'm sorry.\\
255 - Oh...
Gosh.\\
256 - What were you going to do?\\
257 - Well, we're gonna initiate our new
barbecue.\\
258 - We were going to cook hamburgers.\\
259 - Oh, well, you'll have to wait till
tomorrow.\\
260 - You see, this needs about 12 hours,\\
261 - at least, before it sets.\\
262 - Oh...
Oh...
Gotta dry.\\
263 - Well, honey, save it for tomorrow.\\
264 - Well, okay.
We can cook them tomorrow.\\
265 - We'll make something else tonight,
then, hon.\\
266 - All right.
I'll go home and clean up.\\
267 - Wait a minute, Fred.\\
268 - Lucy?
Hmm?\\
269 - Uh... be sure that when you're ready\\
270 - to give Fred a ring.\\
271 - Yeah, Lucy, give me a ring.\\
272 - What are you talking about?\\
273 - I'll call you on the intercom.\\
274 - Why should I give you a ring?
We have an intercom now.\\
275 - Why...?\\
276 - Lucy, you can cook macaroni and
cheese for me anytime.\\
277 - Oh, thanks, Ethel.\\
278 - I'll wash, you dry.\\
279 - No, I'll wash, you dry.\\
280 - Okay.\\
281 - What's the matter?\\
282 - Oh, no.\\
283 - What's the matter, Lucy?\\
284 - My ring is missing.
I've lost my ring.\\
285 - Oh, now, Lucy, are you sure?\\
286 - Yes. Oh, and it couldn't have
happened at a worse time.\\
287 - This morning Ricky found my ring just
lying here,\\
288 - and he just about hit the ceiling.\\
289 - Oh, well, now think, girl.\\
290 - When do you remember wearing it last?\\
291 - Let's see now... after Ricky gave it
back to me,\\
292 - I put it on my finger and I left it
on until...\\
293 - I took it off to mix the cement.\\
294 - I remember. I saw you put it on the
bench.\\
295 - It must be still on there.\\
296 - I left it right here.\\
297 - Oh, dear.\\
298 - Oh, dear.
It isn't here.\\
299 - No, it isn't.\\
300 - Maybe it fell through the slats.\\
301 - Oh, Ethel, I don't see it.\\
302 - Maybe it fell in one of those pails
of water.\\
303 - And we used that water to mix the
cement.\\
304 - Oh, Ethel.\\
305 - My wedding ring\\
306 - is someplace in this barbecue.\\
307 - What are you going to do?\\
308 - What else can we do?\\
309 - Now, Lucy, I'm not going to start\\
310 - taking this whole barbecue apart.\\
311 - Neither one of us are, right now.\\
312 - We're gonna have to wait until the
boys are asleep.\\
313 - No, Lucy, I'm just not going to do
it.\\
314 - I won't do it!
Now, Ethel, I'd do it for you\\
315 - if you'd lost your wedding ring.\\
316 - If I lost my wedding ring we wouldn't
have to find it,\\
317 - we'd just have to buy another box of
Cracker Jack.\\
318 - Ethel, it's my wedding ring,\\
319 - the one that I've had for 16 years.\\
320 - The one that Ricky slipped on my
finger\\
321 - when we promised to love, honor and
obey.\\
322 - When the minister said, "Do you take
this woman...\\
323 - to be your la...?" Look, before you
start\\
324 - singing "O, Promise Me," I'll help
you.\\
325 - Oh, thanks, Ethel.
Thanks.\\
326 - I just got to find that ring.
Well...\\
327 - Now look, after Fred gets to sleep,
you meet me\\
328 - out here, see?
Okay.\\
329 - You know, it's times like these I
wished I'd have kept a diary.\\
330 - Why?\\
331 - Just so I could write, "Dear Diary,\\
332 - "tonight I went out in the backyard
in my nightgown\\
333 - and felt wet cement."\\
334 - Oh, now, Ethel...\\
335 - Oh, Lucy, that's the last of it.\\
336 - Where can your ring be?\\
337 - I don't know...\\
338 - Now, honey, it'll turn up someplace.\\
339 - Oh, gee, it's 2:30.\\
340 - I got to get some sleep.\\
341 - Yeah, I know what you mean.\\
342 - I'm beat, too.\\
343 - What are you doing?\\
344 - I'm putting the barbecue back
together again.\\
345 - Lucy, that'll take you all night.\\
346 - Listen, I'm going to be in enough
trouble\\
347 - when Ricky finds out I lost my
wedding ring.\\
348 - I'd hate to think what he'd do if he
sees this.\\
349 - I could have been in a nice, quiet
apartment in New York.\\
350 - No, I had to move to Connecticut so I
could be near you.\\
351 - I don't blame you for the way you
feel, Ethel.\\
352 - You go on to bed, I'll do this.\\
353 - Good night.\\
354 - Good night.
Sleep tight.\\
355 - Oh, gee, Ethel, thanks.\\
356 - It's times like this\\
357 - when you know what friends are for.\\
358 - If I'd known this is what friends are
for,\\
359 - I'd have signed up as an enemy.\\
360 - Morning!\\
361 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
362 - Hi! Where's Ricky?\\
363 - Oh, he's out flying his kite.
How do you want your eggs?\\
364 - Oh, hold it for a minute.\\
365 - I want to go out and see the
barbecue.\\
366 - Oh, you don't want to look at the
barbecue.\\
367 - Why not?\\
368 - Well, uh, you-you shouldn't look\\
369 - at a barbecue on an empty stomach.\\
370 - Hey, that's very funny.\\
371 - I'll be back in a minute.\\
372 - Lucy, everybody, hurry!\\
373 - Come out here and look!\\
374 - Hurry up! Hurry up!\\
375 - What happened?\\
376 - What happened?\\
377 - Oh, my goodness, how terrible!\\
378 - Oh, isn't that awful?\\
379 - Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.\\
380 - Never mind about your relatives!\\
381 - How did this thing happen?\\
382 - How should I know?\\
383 - That's not the barbecue we built!\\
384 - Of course it isn't!\\
385 - This is a monstrosity!\\
386 - I'll say! I've seen better things\\
387 - built by a beaver with his tail in a
sling.\\
388 - I-It looks like-like somebody took it
apart\\
389 - and-and put it back together again.
Yes.\\
390 - Oh, for heaven's sake, who would do a
thing like that?\\
391 - Well, what else could have happened?\\
392 - Well, any one of a number of things.\\
393 - Like what?\\
394 - Well...\\
395 - like maybe an earthquake...\\
396 - an earthquake last night.\\
397 - Yeah, that's it.\\
398 - They don't have earthquakes here in
Connecticut!\\
399 - That's not it!\\
400 - It looks like it was hit by a
tornado.\\
401 - A tornado, that's it, hit by a big
fat tornado.\\
402 - They don't have tornadoes in
Connecticut, either.\\
403 - Oh, boy, this is a dull state.\\
404 - I tell you what I think it was.\\
405 - What?\\
406 - A couple of hurricanes.\\
407 - Hurricanes!
Oh, hurricanes.\\
408 - Yeah, Hurricane Lucy and Hurricane
Ethel!\\
409 - Whatever makes you think a thing like
that?\\
410 - I don't know.\\
411 - But it just so happens\\
412 - that anytime something goes wrong
around here,\\
413 - I got a pretty good idea where to
start looking.\\
414 - Well, could we help it if the cement
wasn't...?\\
415 - Aha! Aha! The cement was what?\\
416 - What did you say?\\
417 - I didn't say anything, did I, Ethel?\\
418 - Uh, no, no, no.
I didn't...\\
419 - I didn't hear her say a-anything.
Daddy, Daddy!\\
420 - Just-just-just a minute, partner.\\
421 - We're about to hear a very
interesting story\\
422 - from your mother.\\
423 - But Daddy...\\
424 - In a minute, amigo.\\
425 - All right, Lucy, let's hear it.\\
426 - I'd rather hear from little amigo.\\
427 - Lucy!\\
428 - Well, all right.\\
429 - We took the barbecue apart\\
430 - and put it back together again.\\
431 - But why?\\
432 - Why?\\
433 - Don't hold back the sordid details.\\
434 - Because I lost my wedding ring,\\
435 - and we thought it was in the cement,
but it wasn't.\\
436 - Oh, no.\\
437 - Oh, no.\\
438 - Ethel!\\
439 - Were you really in on the
shenanigans?\\
440 - Yes, I was in on the shenanigans,\\
441 - and I'm dead tired\\
442 - from being up all night\\
443 - lifting those heavy bricks.\\
444 - And if you say one more word to me,
Fred Mertz,\\
445 - I'm going to take you apart\\
446 - and put you back together again.\\
447 - I just asked, honeybunch.\\
448 - Ricky, go ahead and get mad or
something\\
449 - and get it over with.\\
450 - I'm not mad.\\
451 - You're not?\\
452 - No, I'm not mad at all.\\
453 - This is all my fault.\\
454 - Your fault?\\
455 - Yeah...\\
456 - I found your ring on the bench here
yesterday\\
457 - when we were building the barbecue,\\
458 - so I hid it in my shirt pocket.\\
459 - But why, honey?\\
460 - To teach you a lesson.\\
461 - I wanted to find out how long it
would take you\\
462 - before you realized it was missing.\\
463 - Oh, dear.\\
464 - I'll go and get it.\\
465 - It's in the shirt I was wearing
yesterday.\\
466 - Oh, honey...\\
467 - that shirt was all covered with
cement.\\
468 - I gave it to Ethel to use as a rag.\\
469 - Oh, and I gave it to Fred\\
470 - to use on the lawnmower.\\
471 - Oh, for corn's sake.\\
472 - What's the matter?
What's the matter?\\
473 - I tore it to pieces to make the tail\\
474 - for Little Ricky's kite.\\
475 - Oh, well, where's your kite?\\
476 - That's what I been trying to tell
you.\\
477 - It flew away.\\
478 - It flew away?\\
479 - Which way?
Which way?\\
480 - Where?!
That way!\\
481 - The barbecue may look kind of funny,\\
482 - but it makes awful good hamburgers,
huh?\\
483 - Yeah, I'm still going to rebuild it.\\
484 - I'll cut it up for you.\\
485 - It sure is an eyesore.\\
486 - Here you are, honey.\\
487 - Mmm-mm!\\
488 - Mmm... good.\\
489 - There you are.\\
490 - Honey?\\
491 - Come on, eat your hamburger.\\
492 - No, thanks, I'm not hungry.\\
493 - Oh, you better have one, honey.
They're awful good.\\
494 - How can I eat when my wedding ring is
flying\\
495 - somewhere over Long Island Sound?\\
496 - Oh, honey...\\
497 - I told you I'll buy you a new one.\\
498 - I don't want a new one.
I want the same one.\\
499 - I feel so terrible about this.\\
500 - I'll tell you what.\\
501 - Look, I'll buy you a new one
with-with\\
502 - big diamonds all around it.\\
503 - I don't want one with big diamonds
all around it.\\
504 - I want mine with the little diamonds
halfway around it.\\
505 - Oh, honey. I'm sorry.\\
506 - Come on, honey. Come on.
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on.\\
507 - Lucy, it's great.
I don't want it.
Come on.\\
508 - Oh, it tastes so good...\\
509 - It's good, really.\\
510 - Mm-mmm!\\
511 - Good, huh?\\
512 - Mmm!\\
513 - Mmm!\\
514 - Hmm, boy...\\
515 - - What?
- What's that?\\
516 - - What?!
- Her ring!\\
517 - I found my ring!
Your ring!\\
518 - Where'd you find it?\\
519 - In the hamburger.\\
520 - In the hamburger?!
In the hamburger!\\
521 - How did it get there?\\
522 - - I don't know!
- Oh...\\
523 - Hey, wait a minute.\\
524 - What?
I think I know.\\
525 - You know, you know, yesterday\\
526 - - when you brought that tray...
- Yeah.\\
527 - ...with the hamburgers and
everything?\\
528 - Oh, yeah?\\
529 - A-And I pi-pick...
bend down\\
530 - to-to give it back to you?\\
531 - Yeah?
Yeah?\\
532 - It must have fallen out of my shirt
in the meat.\\
533 - Oh, Lucy, oh!
Oh, boy!\\
534 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!\\
535 - What's the matter?\\
536 - I want to slip it on your finger,\\
537 - like I did 16 years ago.\\
538 - Oh...\\
539 - honey...\\
540 - There you are...\\
541 - Aw, isn't that romantic?\\
542 - Yeah, just like it was 16 years ago,
only then my ring\\
543 - didn't have mustard and relish all
over it.\\
544 - Oh...
Oh!
\subsection {Episode 25: Country Club Dance (1957)}
1 - You mean he took you to see the
Dodgers at Ebbets Field?\\
2 - Well, wasn't that nice of Mr.
Appleby?\\
3 - Uh-huh... and tomorrow he's taking us
to the zoo.\\
4 - Well, that sounds like fun.\\
5 - Well, good night, sweetheart.\\
6 - Sleep well and I'll see you Monday.\\
7 - Want to say good night to Daddy?
Here.\\
8 - Good night, partner.\\
9 - Good night, Daddy.\\
10 - Good night, son.\\
11 - Good night, dear.\\
12 - Good night.\\
13 - Oh, good thing I called him early.\\
14 - He was in his nighty-nights, all
ready to go to bed.\\
15 - I wish I was in my nighty- nights,
all ready to go to bed.\\
16 - Now, Ricky, don't start that again.\\
17 - Well, it's just that I'd rather be
going to bed\\
18 - than to some boring country club
dance.\\
19 - Oh, grumble, grumble, grumble.\\
20 - Why shouldn't I grumble?\\
21 - Every night of my life I wear a
tuxedo.\\
22 - I take a weekend off, and what do I
do?\\
23 - I'm wearing a tuxedo.\\
24 - Honey, I think you should always wear
a tuxedo.\\
25 - You look very distinguished in it.\\
26 - I look even more distinguished in my
nighty-nights.\\
27 - Aw, now.\\
28 - The Ramseys asked us to be their
guests,\\
29 - we accepted, we're going, and that's
all there is to it.\\
30 - All right, honey, all right.\\
31 - Anyway, honey, it sounds like fun.\\
32 - The Mertzes are going\\
33 - and Harry and Grace Munson are going.\\
34 - Oh, yes, they're bringing along a
houseguest of theirs, too.\\
35 - Who is their houseguest?\\
36 - Oh, I don't know, some cousin of
Grace's--\\
37 - Diana somebody or other.\\
38 - Oh, great. There's another one I'll
have to dance with.\\
39 - Oh, Ethel, you've got a new dress!\\
40 - Isn't it darling?\\
41 - Oh, it's just beautiful.\\
42 - I'm just crazy about it.\\
43 - Wonderful with your eyes.
I love it.\\
44 - And doesn't Freddy look cute in his
tux?\\
45 - Adorable.\\
46 - Oh, I'm adorable, all right.\\
47 - I'm choking to death, my shoes pinch\\
48 - and I reek to high heaven of
mothballs.\\
49 - Oh, Fred.\\
50 - Come in, come in.
Door's open!\\
51 - Oh, look at that girl, will
you?\\
52 - Oh, Betty, you look beautiful!\\
53 - Is that a new dress?\\
54 - Won't we have fun?\\
55 - Come on, let's go, let's go,
huh?\\
56 - Yeah, come on, honey, let's go.\\
57 - All right, listen, take our car; it's
in the garage.\\
58 - All right, we'll take our car. Yeah.\\
59 - Isn't that a beautiful dress on her?\\
60 - We're going dancing...\\
61 - Hey, uh, look, fellas,\\
62 - I want to apologize for this.\\
63 - It was all Betty's idea.\\
64 - You mean you hate the thought of
getting into a tuxedo\\
65 - and going to this dance as much as we
do?\\
66 - Sheesh!\\
67 - The only reason I belong to the
country club\\
68 - is so I can play golf.\\
69 - It's the little woman's idea dragging
me to these affairs.\\
70 - If we'd known how you felt, man,\\
71 - we could have banded together and
refused to go.\\
72 - Yeah. Do you think it's too late to
try?\\
73 - I'm afraid so, Fred, I'm afraid so.\\
74 - The Munsons and their houseguest are
expecting us.\\
75 - Ricky, come on, dear!\\
76 - Ralph!
We're waiting!\\
77 - Fred!!!\\
78 - Yeah, it's too late.\\
79 - Yeah.\\
80 - Coming, honeybunch!\\
81 - Fred, are we gonna dance again?\\
82 - Again! We've already danced once.\\
83 - What's wrong with twice?\\
84 - My feet are still throbbing from
once.\\
85 - Oh, Fred.\\
86 - Oh, stop yawning, Ricky.\\
87 - I'm sorry, honey, it's past my
bedtime.\\
88 - Well, try to stay awake.\\
89 - I am-- if I wasn't trying, I'd be
asleep.\\
90 - Oh...\\
91 - Ralph, why don't you ask the
orchestra\\
92 - to play a Charleston?\\
93 - A Charleston! I haven't that much
energy.\\
94 - Well, honestly.\\
95 - Well, look, if we're just gonna sit
here\\
96 - like bumps on a log, we might as well
go home.\\
97 - Good, let's go home.\\
98 - Second the motion.\\
99 - It's been moved and seconded, we all
go home.\\
100 - All those in favor say "aye."\\
101 - Aye.
Aye.\\
102 - The ayes have it, motion carried,
let's go.\\
103 - Oh, Ricky!\\
104 - Honey, you heard it.
There were three "ayes."\\
105 - Well, there are gonna be three black
eyes\\
106 - unless you all sit down.\\
107 - Fred, come on, now.\\
108 - Besides, it's early.\\
109 - Early!
It's 11:30.\\
110 - It would be rude to leave\\
111 - before the Munsons even get here.\\
112 - All right, I'll give them ten more
minutes.\\
113 - And listen, when they do get here,\\
114 - be sure you ask Grace's cousin to
dance, do you hear?\\
115 - Oh, no, honey, not me.\\
116 - Ralph...\\
117 - Nothing doing.\\
118 - Don't look at me, Ethel.\\
119 - Just because\\
120 - you don't want to dance with us\\
121 - is no reason you should be rude to
Grace's cousin.\\
122 - It's not that we don't want to dance
with you, honey...\\
123 - Oh, for heaven's sake, honey...\\
124 - Hi, folks!\\
125 - Something happen?\\
126 - You get tied up in traffic?\\
127 - Oh, it's always something like
that.\\
128 - Listen, where is your
houseguest?\\
129 - She'll be right along.\\
130 - Oh, here we are, Diana.\\
131 - Hi!\\
132 - I'd like you to meet Grace's
cousin, Diana Jordan.\\
133 - This is Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Ramsey.\\
134 - And how do you do?\\
135 - Hello.\\
136 - And, uh, Mr.
and Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.\\
137 - Hello.\\
138 - How do you do?\\
139 - And I'm Freddy Mertz.\\
140 - Well, hello.\\
141 - Well, hello!\\
142 - I'm Mrs. Mertz.\\
143 - Oh, yeah.\\
144 - Uh, Miss, uh...\\
145 - Diana.\\
146 - Oh, Diana, won't you sit down?\\
147 - Oh, but yes.\\
148 - It's all right, fellows,\\
149 - I've got it.\\
150 - Thank you.\\
151 - Yeah!\\
152 - Well, did we miss anything?\\
153 - Have you been having fun?\\
154 - Oh, we've been having a lovely
time.\\
155 - Yeah, it's been great.\\
156 - Yes, it's been a lot of fun, but we
were just leaving\\
157 - because the boys are so tired.\\
158 - Who's tired?\\
159 - Who's leaving?\\
160 - But it's late.\\
161 - Honey, it's only 11:30.\\
162 - Yes, the night's young.\\
163 - We just got here.\\
164 - Would you care to dance?\\
165 - Oh! But yes.\\
166 - Well, good.\\
167 - Oh, no, wait a minute.\\
168 - My... mother...
told... me...\\
169 - to... pick...\\
170 - you!\\
171 - Oh.\\
172 - Your country club is simply fabulous.\\
173 - Oh, thank you.\\
174 - The music's so dreamy.\\
175 - Do you like to dance?\\
176 - Oh, but yes,\\
177 - I adore it.\\
178 - Oh, well, isn't that nice.\\
179 - Let's cut in.\\
180 - By all means.\\
181 - Well, I see your husband's suddenly
recovered\\
182 - from his sleeping sickness.\\
183 - I see your husband's foot condition\\
184 - finally cleared up.\\
185 - Isn't this a disgusting spectacle?\\
186 - Now what are we supposed to do?\\
187 - Well, maybe we should dance with each
other.\\
188 - My... mother...
told... me...\\
189 - to... pick... you!\\
190 - Dancing is fun.\\
191 - We should do it more often.\\
192 - I was just trying not to be rude.\\
193 - Fred is trying not to be rude, too.\\
194 - He's out there now not being rude.\\
195 - And Ralph is...\\
196 - waiting his turn not to be rude next.\\
197 - What a night.\\
198 - Diana Jordan... sheesh!\\
199 - And they didn't want to be rude to
her.\\
200 - Do you know Ralph danced with that
girl eight times?\\
201 - Ricky danced with her nine times.\\
202 - How about Fred?\\
203 - 13 was the grand total for
Twinkletoes.\\
204 - What an exhibition.\\
205 - You'd think they'd never seen a
blonde before.\\
206 - They still haven't.\\
207 - If she's a blonde, I'm a redhead.\\
208 - How about the boys taking up a
collection\\
209 - so they could keep the orchestra
there\\
210 - for an extra hour?\\
211 - Well, how about Fred, of all people,\\
212 - starting it off with a ten-dollar
bill?\\
213 - And did you see the way they leaped
at the invitation\\
214 - to the party tonight\\
215 - the Munsons are giving in Diana's
honor?\\
216 - Well, I'll tell you one thing:\\
217 - I'm not gonna sit around like a bump
on a log again tonight.\\
218 - As one bump to another, just how do
we avoid it?\\
219 - If our husbands want glamour, let's
be glamorous\\
220 - like Diana.\\
221 - Oh, isn't there an easier way?\\
222 - Ethel, it's simple.\\
223 - Glamour today is nothing but a tight
skirt,\\
224 - loose hips and wet lips.\\
225 - Well, Lucy, that might be all right
for you, dear,\\
226 - but I'm just not the glamorous type.\\
227 - If I could look like Diana,\\
228 - do you think I'd have married Fred?\\
229 - Oh, come on now, there must be some
way\\
230 - for you two to glamour it up.\\
231 - Say, I do have some very exotic
perfume I've been saving.\\
232 - This may be just the occasion to use
it.\\
233 - Good. What about you, Ethel?\\
234 - Oh, I don't know.\\
235 - Why don't you try your glamorous
hairdo,\\
236 - the one that makes you look like
Grace Kelly?\\
237 - You think it'd work?\\
238 - It worked for Grace Kelly.\\
239 - Good. That might be just the thing.\\
240 - Sure, there's no reason\\
241 - why wives can't be just as glamorous
as other women.\\
242 - After all, we were women once
ourselves.\\
243 - Well... our wives are still over at
my house\\
244 - huddled around the dining room table.\\
245 - Boy, we're really in the doghouse.\\
246 - Yup. I sure would give a lot\\
247 - to hear what they're saying.\\
248 - I wouldn't.\\
249 - Betty gave me the silent treatment.\\
250 - Lucky you.
Hmm.\\
251 - Did she really lock you out of the
house?\\
252 - I had to sleep in the rumpus room.\\
253 - That's what we call it\\
254 - because every time we have a rumpus,\\
255 - that's where I sleep.\\
256 - I've never seen Lucy so mad--\\
257 - they way she stormed and ranted and
raved.\\
258 - She acted like me!\\
259 - Boy, they're really sore.\\
260 - Well, it was worth it.\\
261 - That Diana is a cute dish.\\
262 - Ooh, wasn't she, though?\\
263 - Wasn't she, though?\\
264 - And do you know that I think she kind
of went for me?\\
265 - Must be the Yul Brynner influence.\\
266 - Now, listen, you characters.\\
267 - We weren't very nice to our wives
last night.\\
268 - What do you mean?\\
269 - You know what I mean.\\
270 - We acted like a bunch of schoolboys.\\
271 - Well, when I was a schoolboy,\\
272 - there were no schoolgirls like Diana.\\
273 - Well, I think that tonight we should
be nice to the girls.\\
274 - We're going to dance every dance with
our own wives tonight.\\
275 - Every dance?\\
276 - Every dance.\\
277 - With our own wives?\\
278 - Yes, with our own wives.\\
279 - Well, Ralph?\\
280 - Well, yeah, I... I guess you're
right, Rick.\\
281 - How about it, Yul Brynner?\\
282 - Well, okay, but for corns' sake,\\
283 - don't let this get to be a habit.\\
284 - Honey! Hurry up, it's time to go.\\
285 - In a minute, dear.\\
286 - All right.\\
287 - Hi, Rick.\\
288 - Well, hi, fellas.\\
289 - Where are the girls?\\
290 - Oh, Betty's still primping.\\
291 - Yeah, and so is Ethel.\\
292 - She usually takes an hour to dress.\\
293 - Today she's taking over 2? hours.\\
294 - Well, Betty was spraying so much
perfume on herself\\
295 - that I had to get out of the house.\\
296 - Sheesh! One more squirt from that
atomizer\\
297 - and I'd have been overcome by the
fumes.\\
298 - You think you've got a problem!\\
299 - Ethel's got her hair all skinned back\\
300 - like a wet Pekinese.\\
301 - Don't you guys see what the girls are
trying to do?\\
302 - No.\\
303 - They're trying to glamorize
themselves\\
304 - to outshine Diana.\\
305 - You really think so?\\
306 - Sure. Lucy's been locked up\\
307 - in our room all day long getting
ready.\\
308 - I even had to get dressed in the
guest room.\\
309 - Oh-ho-ho, so that's what they're up
to.\\
310 - Oh, brother, if Ethel's trying to be
glamorous,\\
311 - she won't be ready for a week.\\
312 - Now, look, Fred, don't forget what we
promised.\\
313 - We are going to be nice to the girls.\\
314 - Besides, what they're doing I think
is kind of cute.\\
315 - Cute! Wait till you get a look at
Ethel.\\
316 - Wait till you get a whiff of Betty.\\
317 - No matter what they do,\\
318 - we're gonna go right along with them.\\
319 - Okay, you're the boss.\\
320 - Hello.\\
321 - Well, pardon me, beautiful,\\
322 - you have the wrong house.\\
323 - Freddy, it's me.
Who?\\
324 - Ethel!\\
325 - You didn't know me?\\
326 - I didn't know you!\\
327 - Oh, you're a real stunner,\\
328 - you little Dickens.\\
329 - Oh, thank you, Fred.\\
330 - Uh, somebody smells awful good.\\
331 - Oh, uh, yeah, yeah,\\
332 - that's that new perfume that Betty's
wearing.\\
333 - Brings out the beast in a man.\\
334 - Oh!\\
335 - Hi!\\
336 - Hello.\\
337 - What's the matter, dear?\\
338 - Uh...\\
339 - That... that dress.\\
340 - Do you like it?\\
341 - Oh, I think it's lovely...\\
342 - and so are you.\\
343 - Thank you.\\
344 - Oh, Ethel, your hairdo
is simply fabulous.\\
345 - Thank you.\\
346 - Charming.\\
347 - Lucy, do you like my perfume?\\
348 - Oh, I think it's dreamy.\\
349 - But yes, I love it.\\
350 - Uh, shouldn't we go?\\
351 - Yes, let's go.\\
352 - Honey...\\
353 - don't you think that the dress\\
354 - is just a little bit too tight?\\
355 - Oh, but no.\\
356 - Everyone's wearing them like this.\\
357 - Yeah, I know, but are you gonna be
able to sit down?\\
358 - Oh, of course, but yes, I can sit
down.\\
359 - Well, it's a dance, so who'll be
sitting?\\
360 - Well, honey, you're gonna have to sit
down in the car\\
361 - to get to the dance.\\
362 - Well, we'll put the top down\\
363 - and I can stand up all the way.\\
364 - Oh, Lucy, that'd be fun!\\
365 - Yes, by all means, put the top down,
Rick.\\
366 - Put the top down...
all right. Let's go.\\
367 - Yeah, well, wait a minute, girls,
look, listen--\\
368 - you wait right here, I'll go get the
car\\
369 - and bring it to the front.\\
370 - Yeah, honeybunch, don't you walk\\
371 - any more than you have to.\\
372 - Save those gorgeous legs for the
dance.\\
373 - Come on, Fred.\\
374 - I'm coming.\\
375 - We'll be right back, girls.\\
376 - Gorgeous legs!\\
377 - Oh, Lucy, you were absolutely right!\\
378 - A little glamour really works.\\
379 - Yeah... usually I have to wait in the
cold\\
380 - while he backs the car out so I can
close the garage doors.\\
381 - Oh, thank you, Freddy.\\
382 - Thank you.\\
383 - Hey, can I get you a plate\\
384 - from the buffet, dear?\\
385 - Thank you, dear.\\
386 - Lover?\\
387 - Well, I've already had one plate.\\
388 - Oh, have another-- I like my women
chubby.\\
389 - How about you, honey?\\
390 - Oh, I'd adore something to eat.\\
391 - Lucy, you must be getting\\
392 - awful tired of standing up.\\
393 - Oh, it's not too bad, I'm getting to
be a good leaner.\\
394 - I can't get over the way the boys are
acting.\\
395 - It's too good to be true.\\
396 - Yeah, isn't it?\\
397 - Fred hasn't been this nice to me\\
398 - since he thought my aunt left me
$500.\\
399 - Well, I'm going to start buying this
perfume by the barrel.\\
400 - Do you
realize that the boys\\
401 - haven't even looked at Diana tonight?\\
402 - Sure they haven't.\\
403 - It's because we're so devastating.\\
404 - Yeah, well, we're pretty devastating
all right-- for us.\\
405 - But why are they ignoring her the way
they are?\\
406 - It seems very strange.\\
407 - I think there's more to this than
meets the eye.\\
408 - Oh, listen, Lucy, I don't care why
Fred's acting the way he is.\\
409 - I'm just gonna relax and enjoy it.\\
410 - Glammy pie, this is for you.\\
411 - Oh, Fred!\\
412 - Uh, couldn't we dance now and eat
later?\\
413 - Well, I was in hopes you'd ask me,
snookums.\\
414 - Oh!\\
415 - And shall we dance\\
416 - or would you rather eat this one out?\\
417 - Oh, we can always eat.\\
418 - All righty.\\
419 - How about you, honey?
Would you like to dance?\\
420 - No, I think I'd rather eat.\\
421 - Oh, all right.\\
422 - Oh.\\
423 - You know, I've never eaten standing
up before.\\
424 - It's kind of fun at that.\\
425 - Probably good for the digestion.\\
426 - Food goes straight down--\\
427 - doesn't have to make any turns or
nothing.\\
428 - You having a good time, honey?\\
429 - Uh-huh.\\
430 - Ricky!
Oh, hello.\\
431 - You haven't danced with me all
evening.\\
432 - How come?\\
433 - Well, I've been dancing with my wife.\\
434 - What's the matter with Ralph and
Freddy?\\
435 - They've been dancing with their
wives, too.\\
436 - What's this world coming to?\\
437 - Yeah, well.\\
438 - You're certainly acting a lot
different tonight\\
439 - than you did last night.
I am?\\
440 - Yes, and I'd like to know why.\\
441 - Ricky Ricardo, you're up to
something.\\
442 - No, I'm not up to nothing.\\
443 - How come you haven't danced with
Diana tonight?\\
444 - I just don't feel like dancing with
Diana.\\
445 - I want to dance with you.\\
446 - You felt like dancing with her last
night.\\
447 - Oh, honey, well, last night\\
448 - I was just trying to do what you told
me.\\
449 - I was just trying to be polite.\\
450 - Oh, you were just trying to be
polite.\\
451 - Look, why don't you just confess?\\
452 - Confess what?\\
453 - You're up to something;\\
454 - you're being much too sweet.\\
455 - What's wrong with being sweet?\\
456 - When you're this sweet,\\
457 - there's something rotten in Cuba!\\
458 - Wait a minute, I don't know what I'm
gonna do with you.\\
459 - If I don't pay attention to you, you
get mad,\\
460 - and if I pay attention to you, you
get mad.\\
461 - What am I supposed to do?\\
462 - I know that you're just dying to get
out there\\
463 - and dance with Diana,\\
464 - so why don't you go ahead and dance
with her?!\\
465 - All right, I will.\\
466 - All right.
All right!\\
467 - All right!
All right! Okay!\\
468 - Ethel, come on, we're getting out of
here.\\
469 - What do you mean?\\
470 - And tell that beast to take his hands
off you.\\
471 - Beast?\\
472 - I just found out why the boys\\
473 - are being so nice to us.\\
474 - They're cooking up a scheme with that
blonde.\\
475 - What are you talking about?\\
476 - See? Whenever husbands have anything
to hide,\\
477 - they say, "What are you talking
about?"\\
478 - Well, what are you talking about?\\
479 - See?\\
480 - Freddy why are you being so nice to
me?\\
481 - Because husbands should be nice to
their wives.\\
482 - Oh, that's the worst excuse\\
483 - I ever heard in my life.\\
484 - All right, let's go.\\
485 - Yeah, you get Betty, I'll get the
car.\\
486 - I will.\\
487 - Oh! Oh, I'm terribly sorry.\\
488 - Pardon me.\\
489 - Any sign of them yet?\\
490 - No.\\
491 - Well, they should be here by now.\\
492 - It's almost 1:30.\\
493 - Maybe Fred took up another collection
for the band.\\
494 - I must have been crazy\\
495 - to let you talk me into leaving that
party.\\
496 - Me, too. Frankly, I was having a
wonderful time.\\
497 - So was I.\\
498 - It was the best evening I ever spent
with Fred.\\
499 - He was...
Well, he was...\\
500 - almost human.\\
501 - Yeah, well, the whole thing was a
plot.\\
502 - Lucy, just what was this plot?\\
503 - Yeah, you've never been very clear on
that.\\
504 - Well, don't you worry, it was a plot
all right.\\
505 - The three of them and Diana were...
were...\\
506 - Well, they were...\\
507 - Well, they were.\\
508 - Were what?\\
509 - Oh, I don't know,\\
510 - but at least we'll teach the boys a
lesson.\\
511 - Oh, sure, they're out dancing half
the night with that blonde\\
512 - and we're all here brooding\\
513 - and we're teaching them a lesson?\\
514 - Well, this has gone far enough.\\
515 - I'm going back to the club, apologize
to Ralph\\
516 - for running out and bringing him
home.\\
517 - And I'm going with you.
Let's go.\\
518 - Well, now, isn't this a pretty sight?\\
519 - Two cringing wives, crawling on their
knees,\\
520 - begging their husbands' forgiveness.\\
521 - Coming with us, Lucy?\\
522 - Yes.\\
523 - Well, how about it, Rick?\\
524 - Can we go home now?\\
525 - Yeah, it's ten minutes to 2:00.\\
526 - Look, we said we were gonna stay here
until 2:00.\\
527 - Then we'll go home.\\
528 - But it seems like we've been sitting
here for hours.\\
529 - We have. The party broke up at 11:00.\\
530 - The way that our wives run out
of us\\
531 - we agreed that we were gonna stay
here\\
532 - until 2:00 and then go home.\\
533 - That way, they'll think that
we've been\\
534 - dancing with lovely Diana all this
time.\\
535 - Please don't mention dancing in front
of my feet.\\
536 - Has the swelling gone down?\\
537 - No, they're so puffed up; I'll have
to wear Ethel's shoes.\\
538 - Yeah, well, you were lucky.\\
539 - You only danced with her.\\
540 - I tried to talk to her once.\\
541 - You know, it's amazing how little I
have\\
542 - in common with a 20-year-old.\\
543 - Who's Pat Boone?\\
544 - At least you talked to her in
English.\\
545 - I had to spend a half an hour\\
546 - trying to understand her high-school
Spanish.\\
547 - "Bonos dyas, senior."\\
548 - Look...\\
549 - let's either go home or get me more
hot water.\\
550 - All right, Fred, I guess we
can go home now.\\
551 - Don't forget, let's stick to our
story.\\
552 - Okay, okay.\\
553 - Oh, here you are!\\
554 - At 2:00 in the morning!\\
555 - Where is she, the little hussy?\\
556 - I'll scratch her eyes out!\\
557 - Oh, well, you just missed her.\\
558 - Boy, can that girl dance.\\
559 - Dance! You should see the way she
intermissions.\\
560 - I think it's high time\\
561 - that you three gigolos came home with
your wives.\\
562 - Come on, Fred, get your feet\\
563 - out of that bucket. Let's go.\\
564 - All right, all right.\\
565 - Where are your socks?\\
566 - In my shoes.\\
567 - Well, pick 'em up, and we're going
home.\\
568 - All right, all right.\\
569 - Honest to goodness, carrying on...\\
570 - Easy now, easy!
\subsection {Episode 26: Lucy Raises Tulips (1957)}
1 - Fred, cut that out.\\
2 - Fred, you get out of my tulip bed.\\
3 - The idea!\\
4 - What's the matter, Mommy?\\
5 - Oh, Fred's trying to bury his bone in
my tulip bed.\\
6 - Oh, that's naughty, Fred.\\
7 - Yes, that's naughty, Fred.\\
8 - Especially when Mama's trying to win
a prize.\\
9 - A prize?\\
10 - Yeah, the garden club's gonna give a
prize\\
11 - for the best-looking garden tomorrow,\\
12 - and Mama wants to win the prize.\\
13 - Hear that, Fred?\\
14 - Yeah, you hear that, Fred?
Now, you just\\
15 - take your old bone and skedaddle.\\
16 - Here, you take it, honey, and call
him.\\
17 - Come on, Fred.
Go on, go on, Fred.\\
18 - Come on, Fred.
Go on.\\
19 - Come on, Fred.
You go on.\\
20 - Come on, Fred.
Call him.\\
21 - Come on, Fred.
Go and get him, honey.\\
22 - Don't let him run in the street.\\
23 - Fred!\\
24 - Ricky, come back, honey!\\
25 - Here, now, you carry him, dear.\\
26 - Take him way outside there, now.\\
27 - Now, you stay out of here, Fred.\\
28 - Hi, honey.\\
29 - Hi.\\
30 - Oh... how do you think my tulips
look?\\
31 - Oh, they're just beautiful.\\
32 - Do you think I can win a prize?\\
33 - Well, I don't know, Lucy.\\
34 - I was just next door at Betty
Ramsey's,\\
35 - and her tulips are beautiful, too.\\
36 - In fact, her whole\\
37 - garden's just gorgeous.\\
38 - She really has a green thumb.\\
39 - Oh, this isn't work-- it's fun.\\
40 - You know, you ought to have a garden,
Ethel.\\
41 - Then you could have fresh flowers all
the time.\\
42 - Oh, who has to work so hard?\\
43 - I just went down to the village gift
shop\\
44 - and bought some wax tulips,\\
45 - and you can't tell the difference.\\
46 - Wax tulips! Oh, Ethel!\\
47 - How can you live with a substitute\\
48 - when you could have the real thing?\\
49 - I don't know.\\
50 - I've been asking myself that ever
since I married Fred.\\
51 - You know, I-I think I really do have
a chance\\
52 - to win that prize tomorrow.\\
53 - I hope so, honey, but remember, now,\\
54 - Betty's won the cup three years in a
row.\\
55 - That's before I moved to Westport.\\
56 - Gee, I'd get a big kick out of
beating her.\\
57 - She thinks she's so smart.\\
58 - You know, the way she brags about\\
59 - the cross-pollination she does, you'd
think she was a bee.\\
60 - That's what I like--\\
61 - a nice, friendly rivalry between
friends.\\
62 - Well, she thinks she knows
everything.\\
63 - She's always talking about root rot\\
64 - and compost heaps and aphids.\\
65 - and all that stuff.
Shh, here comes the queen bee.\\
66 - Hi.\\
67 - Hi, Betty, dear.\\
68 - I'm going to New York to meet Ralph,\\
69 - but I had to stop by and see how your
garden looks.\\
70 - Oh, Lucy, it's lovely.\\
71 - Oh, can't compare with your garden,
Betty.\\
72 - Oh, I don't know.\\
73 - You're going to be pretty stiff
competition.\\
74 - Well, I know it hasn't got a chance
against your garden.\\
75 - As a matter of fact, I was just
looking at it\\
76 - and I was thinking it looks so ratty\\
77 - I ought to plow it under and plant
rutabagas.\\
78 - Why, this is one of the prettiest
gardens\\
79 - I've ever seen...\\
80 - Well, thanks, Betty.\\
81 - For a beginner.\\
82 - For a beginner?\\
83 - I'll bet you when the judges award
the prizes tomorrow,\\
84 - you're gonna walk away with...
at least second or third.\\
85 - And who do you think's gonna walk
away with first, Betty?\\
86 - Well, three years in a row with the
same bulbs, the same soil...\\
87 - And the same shy, modest gardener.\\
88 - Lucy, that wasn't a very nice thing
to say.\\
89 - Well, it wasn't very nice of you to
call me a beginner.\\
90 - Now, Lucy...
Dear, you are a rank beginner.\\
91 - You don't know the first thing about
gardening.\\
92 - I'll match my tulips against the
blooms\\
93 - from your burned-out bulbs any day.\\
94 - Oh, now look, why doesn't everybody
take her green thumb\\
95 - and go to a neutral corner?\\
96 - You keep out of this, Ethel.\\
97 - Yeah, butt out, Ethel.\\
98 - We'll just see who wins tomorrow.\\
99 - Yeah, we'll just see.\\
100 - And if I were you, Lucy,\\
101 - I wouldn't clear a place on your
mantel for that cup.\\
102 - I hope all your tulips get root rot!\\
103 - Well, now, that was a pretty
exchange.\\
104 - Well, she makes me so mad.\\
105 - There's no reason why I can't win
that prize tomorrow.\\
106 - My tulips are perfect.\\
107 - My roses are beautiful and my lawn...\\
108 - Oh, good heavens, the lawn.\\
109 - Ricky forgot to mow the lawn.\\
110 - Well, it does look kind of shaggy.\\
111 - He promised me faithfully he'd get
this mowing done\\
112 - in time for the judging tomorrow.\\
113 - Husbands make me so mad.
They're always promising you\\
114 - they'll do something for you, and
then they don't do it.\\
115 - Well, that's one problem I never have
with Fred.\\
116 - You don't?
Nope.\\
117 - Never promises to do anything\\
118 - for me in the first place.
Oh...\\
119 - Come on, let's go find my reluctant
grass cutter.\\
120 - Okay.\\
121 - Rick, you asleep?\\
122 - No, Fred, just relaxing.\\
123 - Okay.\\
124 - You think you'd maybe like to go down
to the village?\\
125 - We could browse around the hardware
store\\
126 - and kind of poke at the power tools.\\
127 - No, not today, Fred.\\
128 - My day off.\\
129 - Wouldn't move off this couch if my
foot was on fire.\\
130 - Ricky?\\
131 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
132 - Do you think if a person makes a
promise, he should keep it?\\
133 - Sure, honey.\\
134 - And if a husband makes a promise to
his wife\\
135 - and doesn't keep it, isn't he a cad?\\
136 - I guess so.\\
137 - Then why didn't you cut the grass?\\
138 - Hi, Ethel.\\
139 - What have you got to say?\\
140 - Well, it looks like you're married to
a cad.\\
141 - Ricky!\\
142 - The judges are coming tomorrow,\\
143 - and the lawn looks terrible!\\
144 - Look, honey, it's my day off.\\
145 - I don't feel like pushing a lawnmower
all afternoon.\\
146 - But the grass is a foot high.\\
147 - What am I going to do?\\
148 - Maybe you could rent a couple of
sheep for the day.\\
149 - Oh, you two are a big help.\\
150 - Lucy's trying so hard to beat Betty\\
151 - and win that prize.\\
152 - Ralph cut the grass for Betty.\\
153 - Well, I would, too, if I had a power
mower like Ralph has.\\
154 - Well, good, 'cause Ralph said that
you could borrow\\
155 - his lawnmower any day you want, so
then it's all settled.\\
156 - Except that today is not the day I
want to borrow it.\\
157 - You promised to cut the grass,\\
158 - Enrique Alberto Ricardo y De Acha,
the Third.\\
159 - Well, are you going to do it?\\
160 - When she uses my full name, I'm
cooked.\\
161 - Go help him, Fred.\\
162 - I will not.\\
163 - You go out there and help him,\\
164 - Frederick Hobart Edie Mertz, the
First.\\
165 - Hobart, huh?\\
166 - Hey, the boys are doing a good job on
the lawn.\\
167 - Yeah.\\
168 - Are you ready to go to town?\\
169 - Soon as I finish my list here.\\
170 - Come on, Rick, how about it?\\
171 - Nothing doing.
Get out of my way.\\
172 - I'm not moving.\\
173 - Now, Fred, for the last time,
I'm warning you!\\
174 - What's going on?\\
175 - Now, Fred, I'm telling you for the
last time, I want to cut\\
176 - the lawn where you're standing.
Get out of my way!\\
177 - I'm not moving till you let me take
my turn\\
178 - and quit trying to hog it all.\\
179 - What are you arguing about?\\
180 - Wh-What's-What's the matter?\\
181 - Fred won't get out of my way.\\
182 - It's Ricky. He won't let me take my
turn on the mower.\\
183 - It's not your turn yet!\\
184 - I still got a whole minute to go.\\
185 - Not by my watch, you haven't.\\
186 - Oh, come on, now.\\
187 - You must be able to settle this
peacefully.\\
188 - I'd love to, if he just gets out of
my way.\\
189 - I'm not getting out of his way till
he lets me take my turn.\\
190 - He's been on that mower so long,\\
191 - you'd think he was glued to the seat.\\
192 - Come on, Ricky, let Fred have his
turn.\\
193 - I don't have to let him have his
turn.\\
194 - It's not his lawnmower.\\
195 - Well, it's not yours, either.\\
196 - Well, it's my lawn!\\
197 - Oh, now, now, kiddies.\\
198 - Come on, take your turns\\
199 - like little gentlemen.\\
200 - Well... all right.\\
201 - Go on, take your old turn.\\
202 - Your darn tooting, I will.\\
203 - Oh, come on, let's go.\\
204 - Oh, now wait!
Do you think it's safe\\
205 - to leave the children here with...
all by themselves?\\
206 - They may get to fighting again over
that toy.\\
207 - Well, I'll tell Little Ricky to keep
his eye on them.\\
208 - How do you start this thing?\\
209 - Figure it out for yourself.\\
210 - Oh, gee, isn't it a beautiful day?\\
211 - Yeah, and the lawn looks great--\\
212 - what they've cut of it.\\
213 - Yeah. I wonder why they left the
mower\\
214 - out by the garage.\\
215 - Where do you think they've gone?\\
216 - Probably in the kitchen having a cold
drink.\\
217 - Hey!\\
218 - They're not in there.\\
219 - Ricky!\\
220 - Fred!\\
221 - That's funny.\\
222 - Well, they can't have gone far,
honey,\\
223 - with the lawn only half-mowed.\\
224 - Oh, they haven't gone far, huh?\\
225 - Just to Yankee Stadium.\\
226 - What?\\
227 - "Harry Munson had some tickets\\
228 - "for the baseball game,\\
229 - and we took Little Ricky with us."\\
230 - Well, what are they gonna do about
the lawn?\\
231 - It says they'll finish it in the
morning.\\
232 - Oh, well, then that's all right.\\
233 - All right, my foot!
I have no idea how early\\
234 - those judges are coming in the
morning.\\
235 - Oh, honestly!\\
236 - If they hadn't spent so much time\\
237 - arguing about whose turn it was\\
238 - they could've had it finished.\\
239 - Well, I guess there's just one thing
to do.\\
240 - What?
I'll have to finish the lawn myself.\\
241 - You?!\\
242 - You don't know anything\\
243 - about running a power mower.\\
244 - Well, what is there to know?\\
245 - I know how to drive a car.\\
246 - It can't be any harder than that.\\
247 - Come on.\\
248 - Interesting little machine, isn't it?\\
249 - I wonder how you get it started.\\
250 - Oh, fine.\\
251 - Oh, look, it's got a crank.
I guess you crank it\\
252 - like the old Model T's, remember?\\
253 - That was quite a bit before my time.\\
254 - Oh, come, now, Ethel.\\
255 - I only go back as far as the Stutz
Bearcat and no farther.\\
256 - Oh...\\
257 - Hey, this looks like it might be fun.\\
258 - Come on, crank her up, girl.\\
259 - Gee, it's got gear shifts and
everything.\\
260 - Oh, you got to get a good grip.\\
261 - You got to get a good grip and go
around there.\\
262 - Lots of elbow grease.
Steady--\\
263 - steady around.\\
264 - Oh, honey, you're not doing it right.\\
265 - This is exactly the way we used to
cr...\\
266 - Same way you used to crank, huh?\\
267 - Well, I've been watching those old
movies on television.\\
268 - Oh...
They... do it there.\\
269 - Yeah.
The late, late show.\\
270 - Yeah. Come on, crank her up.\\
271 - There she goes!\\
272 - Hooray!\\
273 - Ethel, what do I do?\\
274 - Switch it off, Lucy!\\
275 - I can't!\\
276 - Switch it off!\\
277 - No, no!
Well...\\
278 - Lucy, turn it off!\\
279 - I don't know how to turn it off!\\
280 - There must be a switch there
someplace!\\
281 - A switch, a switch!
Lucy, what are you do...?!\\
282 - I don't know where the switch is!\\
283 - What?!
I don't know where...\\
284 - Call the hardware store!\\
285 - Ask Mr. Becks how to turn it off!\\
286 - The hardware store?\\
287 - Yeah!
Mr. Becks?\\
288 - Hurry up, I'm getting dizzy!\\
289 - Operator, get me the Village Hardware
Store, quick.\\
290 - Hello, Mr. Becks, this is Mrs. Mertz.\\
291 - You know that power lawnmower that
you sold...?\\
292 - I'm fine, thank you.\\
293 - You know that power lawnmower that
you sold, uh...?\\
294 - He's fine, too, thank you.\\
295 - You know that power lawnmower that
you sold to the Ramseys?\\
296 - Well, how do you turn it off?\\
297 - Oh, Mr. Becks, I haven't got time\\
298 - to look at a book of instructions.\\
299 - M-Mrs. Ricardo's outside, and she's
on the thing,\\
300 - and she's going around in circles!\\
301 - Yes, in circles!\\
302 - Huh?
Ethel!\\
303 - Oh, Mr. Becks, she's not going in
circles anymore.\\
304 - She's-she's running amok.\\
305 - Huh?\\
306 - What?\\
307 - Ethel...!\\
308 - Now she's running amok backwards.\\
309 - Huh?\\
310 - Well, ho... just tell me how to shut
it off.\\
311 - Ethel!\\
312 - There she goes again.\\
313 - What? A little gadget that's by the
carburetor?\\
314 - Well, where's the carburetor?\\
315 - Oh, is that the carburetor?\\
316 - Oh, now, what do I do?
I push down on that...\\
317 - by the little gadget, and that...
O-Okay.\\
318 - Just a minute and I'll see if I can
find the gadget.\\
319 - Lucy!\\
320 - Lucy!\\
321 - Lucy!\\
322 - Mr. Becks, I can't even find Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
323 - What?\\
324 - She just went by your store heading
for Main Street?\\
325 - Oh, no!\\
326 - Lucy?\\
327 - Oh, it's you, Grace.\\
328 - Uh, this is Ethel.\\
329 - No, Lucy isn't here just now.\\
330 - Well, to tell you the truth, I don't
know just where she is,\\
331 - but the last I heard\\
332 - she was on a lawnmower heading toward
Main Street.\\
333 - No, I haven't been nipping at the
cooking sherry.\\
334 - Grace, I think I hear her coming now.\\
335 - Yeah, she's heading this way.\\
336 - Call back later, Grace.\\
337 - Oh, Lucy.\\
338 - Hi.\\
339 - Are you all right?\\
340 - Yeah, I'm all right.\\
341 - Oh, honey!\\
342 - Poor little thing.\\
343 - How'd you finally get that thing
stopped?\\
344 - Well, you know that hedge out here\\
345 - that we were thinking of getting rid
of?\\
346 - Yeah.\\
347 - We don't have to think about that
anymore.\\
348 - Did you hurt the lawnmower?\\
349 - No, not a scratch on it.\\
350 - That thing is indestructible.\\
351 - Oh, Lucy.\\
352 - Where have you been?\\
353 - Oh, where haven't I been?\\
354 - I've seen parts of Connecticut I
didn't even know existed.\\
355 - First that galloping grass cutter\\
356 - took me straight through the main
street of town.\\
357 - The way people came out of their
houses to watch me ride by\\
358 - you'd have thought I was Lady Godiva.\\
359 - Then what happened?\\
360 - Well, the next thing I knew I was on
the Boston Post Road.\\
361 - The Boston Post Road?\\
362 - Why did you go on a busy highway like
that?\\
363 - It wasn't my idea.\\
364 - That beast has a mind of its own.\\
365 - I stayed on that Post Road for a mile
and a half.\\
366 - You didn't.\\
367 - Yeah.\\
368 - Against traffic all the way.\\
369 - Oh, Lucy.\\
370 - You must've been terrified.\\
371 - Oh, I was. If I ever let my hair get
dark at the roots\\
372 - I'm afraid it's going to be snow
white.\\
373 - Lucy?\\
374 - What?\\
375 - Was there much damage?\\
376 - Well, every lawn between here and
town is half-mowed.\\
377 - Well, thank goodness nothing really
serious happened.\\
378 - That's what you think.\\
379 - Just now as I was coming through the
Ramseys' yard\\
380 - I plowed right through Betty's
garden.\\
381 - Lucy... what happened?\\
382 - All of them?\\
383 - All the tulips.\\
384 - When I looked back, all I saw was a
sea of stems.\\
385 - Oh, honey.\\
386 - Oh, what am I ever going to tell
Betty?\\
387 - She'll think I did it on purpose.\\
388 - Oh, now, don't get too upset.\\
389 - Uh... maybe you could get some tulips
at the nursery\\
390 - a-and put them in Betty's garden\\
391 - before she gets back from town.\\
392 - Oh, honey, there isn't a tulip left\\
393 - in the nursery with a bloom on it.\\
394 - I was just there yesterday.\\
395 - I feel so bad, I could cry.\\
396 - Oh, dear.\\
397 - I know what you could do.
What?\\
398 - You can take your tulips\\
399 - and transplant them into Betty's
garden.\\
400 - Ethel, I feel bad, but not that bad.\\
401 - Now, Lucy...\\
402 - Well, maybe I'd better.
I ruined hers.\\
403 - I guess it's only fair I give her
mine.\\
404 - Good girl.\\
405 - Oh, gee, when I think of the loving
care\\
406 - I've given those little pink blooms.\\
407 - Wait a minute.\\
408 - Betty's tulips are yellow.\\
409 - I could never fool her with my pink
ones.\\
410 - It won't work...
thank goodness.\\
411 - Gee, that's right, they were yellow,\\
412 - just like those wax ones I bought.\\
413 - That's it!\\
414 - Wax tulips! I'll go down to the gift
shop\\
415 - and get some wax tulips and put them
in there.\\
416 - Come on!\\
417 - Lucy?
While we're down there,\\
418 - can I get some liniment for my
shoulder?\\
419 - Yeah.\\
420 - the Boston Post Road and headed for
home.\\
421 - Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.\\
422 - You mean to tell me you were going
the wrong way\\
423 - on the Boston Post Road?
Yeah, honey.\\
424 - But nothing happened--\\
425 - no accidents or anything.\\
426 - All that happened was\\
427 - that people slammed on their brakes\\
428 - and pulled over to the side.\\
429 - when they saw me coming.\\
430 - Then what happened?\\
431 - Well, like I said, I-I finally got\\
432 - the fool thing headed for home, and I
went along pretty good--\\
433 - except for an occasional detour into
someone's yard, you know--\\
434 - until I got to the Ramseys'.\\
435 - And then that infernal machine\\
436 - had the nerve to plow right through
Betty's tulip bed.\\
437 - Oh, no.
Yeah.\\
438 - How did you finally get it stopped?\\
439 - Well, I-I cleverly ran it into that
hedge\\
440 - I wanted to get rid of.\\
441 - How come you didn't turn that little
switch\\
442 - by the carburetor and shut off the
motor?\\
443 - Because I didn't know anything about
the little switch\\
444 - by the carburetor to shut off the
motor!\\
445 - Now, don't pick on him just because
you insisted\\
446 - on fooling around with a machine\\
447 - that you didn't know anything about.\\
448 - And I wouldn't have been fooling
around\\
449 - with a machine I didn't know anything
about\\
450 - if you hadn't gone tooting off to
some\\
451 - baseball game.\\
452 - Well, you know something, honey,\\
453 - you're right.\\
454 - I let you down.\\
455 - The minute the Ramseys get home, I'll
go over there\\
456 - and I'll tell Betty that it was all
my fault.\\
457 - Oh, well, honey, thank you, but that
won't be necessary.\\
458 - What do you mean?\\
459 - Well, I know how Betty feels about
her garden,\\
460 - so I replaced them.\\
461 - Oh, good. You went to the nursery\\
462 - and bought some new ones and
transplanted them, huh?\\
463 - Yeah, well... No, the nursery was all
out of tulips,\\
464 - so I went to the gift shop\\
465 - and got some wax ones.\\
466 - Wax tulips?!\\
467 - Yeah.\\
468 - Oh, you think you're going to fool\\
469 - the judges with wax tulips?\\
470 - Oh, yes.\\
471 - Yeah, Rick.\\
472 - They look real.
You can't tell the difference.\\
473 - Oh, come on, now. Any child can tell
the difference\\
474 - between a real tulip and a... and a
wax tulip.\\
475 - Well, honey, do you mean that I
wouldn't be able\\
476 - to get wax tulips that look as good
as these?\\
477 - Never in a million years.\\
478 - These are wax.\\
479 - What are you talking about?\\
480 - Yeah.\\
481 - By George, they are wax.\\
482 - Yeah.\\
483 - You know something, maybe these could
fool the judges.\\
484 - Oh, I hope so, for Betty's sake.\\
485 - And look, for my sake, when are you
going to finish\\
486 - cutting the grass?\\
487 - I'm going to do it right now.\\
488 - Right now?!
Yeah.\\
489 - It's so dark, you won't know what
you're doing.\\
490 - Oh, yes, I'll be able to see all
right.\\
491 - Besides this thing was all my fault.\\
492 - The sooner I get it out of the way,\\
493 - the better I'll feel.\\
494 - Well, okay, honey.\\
495 - Fred, we're having dinner over here
tonight,\\
496 - so just read the paper for a while,
while we fix it.\\
497 - Okay, okay.\\
498 - Fred, where are the
girls?\\
499 - In the kitchen.\\
500 - Come on.\\
501 - Where we going?\\
502 - I want you to go to the gift shop for
me.\\
503 - What for?\\
504 - Well, you know how Lucy said that it
was\\
505 - too dark out there to see what I was
doing?\\
506 - Yeah.
She was right.\\
507 - Do you mean...?\\
508 - Yeah, Lucy's tulips are going to be
wax, too.\\
509 - Come on, let's go.
Oh, no.\\
510 - ...some of those marigolds...\\
511 - Well, the judges are still over at
the Ramseys'.\\
512 - Oh, honey, is it hot, or am I just
nervous?\\
513 - Both-- it's hot, all right.\\
514 - Why are they taking\\
515 - so long over there?
I don't know.\\
516 - They didn't find out about the
tulips, did they?\\
517 - Now, now, honey, calm down.
Everything will be all right, dear.\\
518 - Oh, I just hope those judges are
nearsighted.\\
519 - That makes two of us.\\
520 - What?\\
521 - Uh... we don't want Betty to find
out...
Lucy!\\
522 - Do you know anything about this
outrage?\\
523 - What outrage?\\
524 - The judges have disqualified me.\\
525 - Someone replaced my tulips with wax
ones.\\
526 - Oh, Betty, I'm sorry.\\
527 - I can explain everything.\\
528 - Then you did do it.\\
529 - Oh, Lucy, I knew you wanted to win,\\
530 - but I didn't think you'd stoop so
low.\\
531 - Oh, now, Betty, it was an accident.\\
532 - I ran amok on that lawnmower of yours\\
533 - and just plowed through your garden.\\
534 - And I-I tried to fix it by replacing
your tulips\\
535 - with the wax ones.\\
536 - I'm sorry.
Well, you fixed it, all right.\\
537 - You fixed it so I couldn't possibly
win.\\
538 - Oh, I really...
I'm terribly sorry, Betty.\\
539 - Look, if I win the cup, I'll give it
to you.\\
540 - Well, that won't be necessary.\\
541 - No, I insist, Betty.\\
542 - Uh, Betty, by the way,\\
543 - how did the judges find out\\
544 - that the tulips were wax?\\
545 - Well, it wasn't hard.\\
546 - They were melting in the sun.\\
547 - Lucy, the judges are coming up the
walk.\\
548 - The judges are here.
This is it.\\
549 - Yeah, this is it, all right.\\
550 - Lucy, honey?\\
551 - Yeah?\\
552 - Uh, I got to tell you something,
dear.\\
553 - What?\\
554 - Yeah?\\
555 - Huh?!\\
556 - Good luck.\\
557 - Oh.\\
558 - Oh, please...\\
559 - Lovely, just lovely.\\
560 - Oh, thank you.
Yes.\\
561 - Certainly the nicest grounds we've
seen.\\
562 - Oh...\\
563 - Well, I don't think there's any doubt\\
564 - about who the winner will be.\\
565 - You mean Lucy's won?\\
566 - Oh, honey.\\
567 - Well, as long as it couldn't be me,\\
568 - I'm glad it was you, Lucy.\\
569 - Oh, thanks, Betty, but my offer still
goes\\
570 - about that cup.
Oh, no!\\
571 - Well, look, let's all go inside\\
572 - and have some lemonade, eh?
It's very hot outside.\\
573 - These are remarkably perfect tulips.
Yeah, well, let's...\\
574 - Well, I certainly loved raising them.\\
575 - You see, I started from scratch.
I-I didn't have a compost heap.\\
576 - I didn't have anything, 'cause I just\\
577 - moved here, as you well know.
Let's go inside\\
578 - and have some lemonade.
Huh? Everybody?\\
579 - And I just had a wonderful...\\
580 - We can talk about it inside, honey.\\
581 - If you notice these wonderful little,
uh...\\
582 - Oh, no!\\
583 - My tulips, my tulips!\\
584 - What's happening to my baby tulips?\\
585 - My little pink blooms!\\
586 - Oh, gracious!\\
587 - These are wax, too.\\
588 - Wax!\\
589 - Well!\\
590 - Now, just a minute.
Well, what?\\
591 - Just a minute, just a minute, girls.\\
592 - Honey? Uh... Betty didn't have
anything to do about this.\\
593 - I can 'splain.\\
594 - You?\\
595 - Well, start "splaining."\\
596 - Well, now, this might be very hard to
believe,\\
597 - but you know, like you said last
night,\\
598 - it was too dark outside to see what\\
599 - I was doing?
Yes? Yes?\\
600 - Well, you was right.
It was dark.\\
601 - Oh, it was so dark!\\
602 - It was darker than the inside of your
sombrero.\\
603 - And, uh, I was mowing the lawn very
nicely.\\
604 - I mean, you really...
I don't know\\
605 - how you did so well on the Boston
Post Road, I...\\
606 - Never mind!\\
607 - Here again are Lucille
Ball and Desi Arnaz\\
608 - for our alternate sponsors.\\
609 - Listen, honey, tonight I gotta tell
the ladies\\
610 - about the new Squiz Cumb Lilt Home
Permanent,\\
611 - and I need your help.\\
612 - Oh, you sure do.\\
613 - It's the new Squeeze Comb Lilt Home
Permanent.\\
614 - Ah, you don't understand, honey.\\
615 - Just tell me the name of this thin'
here.\\
616 - That's the Squiz Cumb.\\
617 - I mean it's a Squeeze Comb.\\
618 - No, no, no, no, this.\\
619 - Oh, that's the comb tip.\\
620 - Thank you.\\
621 - Now, this cumb tip cumbs the lotion
right into your hair\\
622 - out of a squiz bottle.\\
623 - Remember how we gals used to dip-dab
those messy lotions on?\\
624 - Well, that's out.\\
625 - With new Lilt, you just squeeze the
bottle\\

4 - Fred!\\
5 - Fred, wake up!\\
6 - Fred!\\
7 - What is it, Ethel?\\
8 - Fred, this is Lucy on the intercom.\\
9 - Oh, oh.\\
10 - Is Ethel there?\\
11 - No.\\
12 - Well, where is she?\\
13 - How should I know?\\
14 - Well, she's your wife.\\
15 - Well, did you wake me up just to rub
it in?\\
16 - Oh...\\
17 - Listen, Ethel was supposed to be here
an hour ago.\\
18 - I don't know how I'm gonna do all the
things I have to do\\
19 - for the Yankee Doodle Day celebration\\
20 - if Ethel isn't gonna cooperate with
me.\\
21 - Honestly!\\
22 - Listen, Fred, did you try on your
costume yet?\\
23 - Fred, did you try on your costume
yet?\\
24 - Really.\\
25 - Committee member Mertz reporting.\\
26 - Ethel, where have you been?\\
27 - I've got a million things to check
with you.\\
28 - Let me see that poster.\\
29 - "Yankee Doodle Day Celebration."
Uh...\\
30 - I thought it was supposed to say\\
31 - "Lucy Ricardo, chairman\\
32 - Did you put these posters up all over
town?\\
33 - Yeah.\\
34 - Did you nail them\\
35 - to the telephone poles like I asked
you to?\\
36 - All right, now. Let's see.\\
37 - Did you call all the members of my
committee\\
38 - and ask them to be here for luncheon
tomorrow?\\
39 - Yep, I did.\\
40 - All of them?\\
41 - Yep, all of them.\\
42 - Did you check the man who's writing\\
43 - a special song about the Battle of
Campo?\\
44 - Yep. I did that.\\
45 - Did you talk to Mr. Silvestri the
sculptor,\\
46 - make sure the statue will be ready\\
47 - the day after tomorrow?\\
48 - Yeah. Uh-huh.\\
49 - Day after tomorrow.\\
50 - Yep, yep, yep.\\
51 - Did you rent the trailer to carry it
in?\\
52 - Yep, yep.\\
53 - Good. Oh, boy!\\
54 - I'm never gonna be chairman of
another committee.\\
55 - It's too much work.\\
56 - For who?\\
57 - For me.\\
58 - For you?!\\
59 - Who do you think's been doing all the
work?\\
60 - How about... Ouch!\\
61 - Listen, Ethel, I just mean\\
62 - that I have all the responsibility.\\
63 - I'm the one that has to sit home and
worry\\
64 - about whether you're getting all the
work done or not.\\
65 - Well, now, I'll just make you a deal.\\
66 - Next year, I'll sit home and worry,\\
67 - and you go out and nail your thumb to
a telephone pole.\\
68 - Oh, Ethel. Listen.\\
69 - We are commemorating a battle of the
Revolutionary War.\\
70 - Now, let's not start one of our own.\\
71 - Well, all right.
Okay.\\
72 - Did you and Fred try on your costumes
yet?\\
73 - Yep.
How were they?\\
74 - Oh, mine's just fine.\\
75 - Fred's grumbling about his as usual.\\
76 - He's gonna wear it, isn't he?\\
77 - Yeah, I think he is.\\
78 - When I left this morning,\\
79 - he was standing in front of a mirror,\\
80 - trying on his powdered wig.\\
81 - It was a proud sight.\\
82 - It's the first time in 20 years\\
83 - Fred's been able to brush his hair.\\
84 - Well, I got Ricky to read the speech
at the unveiling.\\
85 - You did?
Yeah.\\
86 - Did you have much of a struggle?\\
87 - No. He agreed to it right away.\\
88 - You mean you didn't have to trick him
or anything?\\
89 - Mm.\\
90 - My, he's getting agreeable these
days.\\
91 - I know. Things are working out
beautifully.\\
92 - Ricky's getting mellow just as I'm
running out of tricks.\\
93 - Lucy!\\
94 - What?\\
95 - Look at this!\\
96 - What is it?\\
97 - Fred! He chewed up my slippers!\\
98 - Fred wouldn't do a thing like that.\\
99 - Oh, he means the dog Fred.\\
100 - Oh.\\
101 - I knew we made a mistake\\
102 - letting Little Ricky name that dog
Fred.\\
103 - We made a mistake letting Little
Ricky\\
104 - get the dog in the first place.\\
105 - Where is that four-legged beast?\\
106 - Oh, I don't know. He's up with Little
Ricky, I guess.\\
107 - Well, where is Ricky?
He's not in his room.\\
108 - Well, he must be up there someplace.
Ricky!\\
109 - Yes, Mommy?\\
110 - Is Fred up there with you?\\
111 - No, Mommy.\\
112 - What is that you have on your
face?\\
113 - I'm a clown.\\
114 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!\\
115 - He's a clown.\\
116 - March yourself right down here, young
man.\\
117 - He must have gotten into my
makeup kit.\\
118 - Yeah. Ricky, you shouldn't put stuff
like that\\
119 - all over your face, honey.\\
120 - Daddy was a clown this morning.\\
121 - Yeah, I know I was a clown this
morning,\\
122 - but that's because I'm doing a circus
number at the club.\\
123 - I wanted to show Mommy how I was
gonna look.\\
124 - Well, from now on,\\
125 - you'd better not bring home your
m-a-k-e-u-p.\\
126 - I know what that is.\\
127 - You do?\\
128 - Uh-huh. It's spelling.\\
129 - It's spelling. Yeah.\\
130 - Well, now, you go on upstairs\\
131 - and take all that stuff off your
face,\\
132 - and don't you ever get in Daddy's
makeup kit again.\\
133 - Okay, Mommy.
Go on now.\\
134 - Where's Fred?\\
135 - In the den, Daddy, sleeping in your
chair.\\
136 - In the den, sleeping in my chair.\\
137 - You know, that dog uses my favorite
chair more than I do.\\
138 - Well, he likes to be comfortable like
anyone else.\\
139 - Well, then why doesn't he go out and
buy his own izzy share?\\
140 - He's not gonna hurt your old "izzy
share."\\
141 - Besides, there's a brand-new doghouse
in the backyard,\\
142 - and you were supposed to keep him
there.\\
143 - He doesn't like it out there.\\
144 - Why not?
I don't know.\\
145 - Why don't you ask him?\\
146 - Mira, que tiene cosa...\\
147 - el perro este no le gusta la casa de
perro...\\
148 - And stop jabbering at me in a foreign
tongue.\\
149 - I got enough trouble without you
being cranky.\\
150 - I am not cranky!\\
151 - The dog sits in my favorite chair all
the time.\\
152 - He doesn't like the doghouse that I
bought him.\\
153 - He chews up all my slippers.\\
154 - Ever since we got that animal,\\
155 - he's leading my life\\
156 - and I'm leading the dog's life.\\
157 - I'm sorry you have to hear all this
arguing, Ethel.\\
158 - Oh, that's all right.\\
159 - Makes me feel right at home.\\
160 - I thought you were taking him to
obedience school.\\
161 - I have been.\\
162 - Well, then, how come\\
163 - that he hasn't learned how to
obedience?\\
164 - Well, I don't know.
Maybe it's because\\
165 - I haven't been helping him with his
homework.\\
166 - Well, you'd better help him with his
homework,\\
167 - or I'm going to take him right back
to the pound\\
168 - that's where we got him.\\
169 - Oh, honey, now you don't mean that.\\
170 - Anyway, he's graduating from
obedience school tomorrow,\\
171 - and I'm sure he's gonna come through
with flying colors.\\
172 - Good.
Now, listen.\\
173 - Did you try your costume on yet?\\
174 - Oh, that's another thing.\\
175 - I'll make the speech,\\
176 - but I'm not gonna wear that
silly-looking\\
177 - Yankee Doodle dandy outfit that you
got me. No.\\
178 - Oh, honey, you look so wonderful\\
179 - in a Revolutionary War uniform.\\
180 - Oh, sure, yeah.\\
181 - Yeah, those knee breeches will give
you a chance\\
182 - to show off your good-looking legs.\\
183 - I am not going to be seen\\
184 - in those silly early-American
snickers.\\
185 - It's knickers.\\
186 - That's what I said-- snickers.\\
187 - Well, now, look.
you're making a mistake.\\
188 - I'll leave it to you, Ethel.\\
189 - Doesn't he have good-looking legs?\\
190 - Come on, now, will you?
Cut it out.\\
191 - Well, everybody else is wearing a
costume.\\
192 - Yeah, Rick.
Even Fred.\\
193 - Yeah? What's he wearing?\\
194 - Oh, he's got a wonderful one.\\
195 - He's gonna be the town crier.\\
196 - He's gonna go through the town
ringing a bell,\\
197 - announcing all the ceremonies.\\
198 - This I got to see.\\
199 - Well, will you wear it or not?\\
200 - All right, all right.\\
201 - I'll go learn my speech.\\
202 - Okay, he will.
Oh, honestly.\\
203 - They give you a fight, don't they?\\
204 - What you have to go through...\\
205 - Boy, oh, boy.\\
206 - ...to get him into costume for a
thing like this.\\
207 - Hear ye!\\
208 - Hear ye! Hear ye!\\
209 - Oh, Fred, you look wonderful!\\
210 - Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye!\\
211 - Get yourself another town crier!\\
212 - What are you talking about?\\
213 - I refuse to do this fool thing.\\
214 - Well, why, Fred?\\
215 - Well, first of all, this ding-dang
wig is too hot!\\
216 - How do people stand it when they have
hair?\\
217 - Listen, Fred.
Maybe you can do it\\
218 - without the wig, huh?\\
219 - That's not all.\\
220 - These things are killing my feet.\\
221 - If their shoes pinched like these,\\
222 - no wonder the town criers cried.\\
223 - Fred, we can get you some bigger
shoes.\\
224 - Oh, sure, Fred. You gotta do
something\\
225 - to celebrate Yankee Doodle Day.\\
226 - Well, I can always stick a feather in
my hat\\
227 - and call it macaroni.\\
228 - Oh, now, Fred.\\
229 - Fred!\\
230 - Come on, now.\\
231 - Say you'll be the town crier.\\
232 - No, sir. I wouldn't go yelling
through town in this outfit\\
233 - if the British were to come back
again!\\
234 - Oh, Fred!\\
235 - I'll get him to do it.\\
236 - Don't worry about it.\\
237 - I'll get him to do it.\\
238 - Now, listen, Fred...\\
239 - Fred! Fred! Fred!\\
240 - Fred! Fred!\\
241 - Where did he go?\\
242 - What did he do?\\
243 - He chewed up my whole speech.\\
244 - Oh. Well, now, honey, don't, don't,
don't be mad at him.\\
245 - He won't do these things\\
246 - once he's graduated from obedience
school.\\
247 - If you ask me, we should have sent
him to reform school.\\
248 - Oh...\\
249 - "Fellow citizens of Westport,\\
250 - "we're gathered here on Yankee Doodle
Day\\
251 - to commemorate, to unveil and
dedicate a statue."\\
252 - "The statue will commemorate the
great bravery and daring courage\\
253 - "of the patriots of this community\\
254 - "during the Battle of Campo in 17...\\
255 - "1777.\\
256 - "I hereby dedicate this statue to the
ancestors\\
257 - "of these brave men,\\
258 - "many of whom are still living...\\
259 - Hi, dear.\\
260 - in this..." Oh, hi.\\
261 - Congratulations are in order.
Fred graduated!\\
262 - Well! Congratulations, old man!\\
263 - What's that?\\
264 - That's his diploma.\\
265 - Well, we'll frame it up\\
266 - and put it in his doghouse.
Yeah.\\
267 - Did he really learn something?\\
268 - Well, I told you he graduated.\\
269 - Well, good for you, because I'm
running out of slippers.\\
270 - Hey, who set the table for my
luncheon?\\
271 - Oh, Ethel did.\\
272 - And there's a beautiful plate\\
273 - of cold cuts back in the kitchen.\\
274 - Oh, good.
They're delicious.\\
275 - What are you doing?\\
276 - These cold cuts are for my committee
members.\\
277 - Well, what is the principal speaker\\
278 - supposed to eat for lunch?\\
279 - I'll fix you\\
280 - a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\\
281 - Thanks a lot.\\
282 - Well, Fred, now let's see if you
really graduated.\\
283 - I want you to take this diploma,\\
284 - take it over to Little Ricky upstairs
and show it to him.\\
285 - Then after you do that,\\
286 - I want you to the diploma over to the
guest house\\
287 - and show it to Aunt Ethel and Uncle
Fred.\\
288 - Oh, for heaven's sake, Ricky.\\
289 - He can't do all that.\\
290 - Well, you just told me\\
291 - he graduated from obedience school.\\
292 - Well, he learned obedience,\\
293 - but he's not ready for The Ed
Sullivan Show.\\
294 - What can he do?\\
295 - He can do lots of things.\\
296 - He can sit up, he can speak, he can
roll over.\\
297 - I'll show you later.\\
298 - Well, show me now.\\
299 - No. I haven't got time now, honey.\\
300 - I gotta get this luncheon going.\\
301 - Listen. I paid 30 bucks\\
302 - for this character to go to that
school.\\
303 - I want to see what he learned.\\
304 - I don't want to show you right now.\\
305 - I will show you later.\\
306 - Apparently, the wrong one went to
obedience school.\\
307 - Oh, all right.\\
308 - Show what you learned to Senor Simon
Legree.\\
309 - Leash. Come on, now, Fred.\\
310 - All righty, boy.\\
311 - Show Daddy what we learned here, huh?\\
312 - Oh, boy, he graduated top honors,\\
313 - too, boy.
All right, now.\\
314 - Sit up, honey.\\
315 - Sit up, Fred.\\
316 - Fred, sit up.\\
317 - Come on, Fred, sit up.\\
318 - Aw, come on, Fred.
You know how to sit up.\\
319 - Now, you're not paying attention.
Come on, now.\\
320 - Sit up.
Here we go.\\
321 - Up we go.\\
322 - Up, up, up, up, Fred. Up!\\
323 - Show Daddy how you can sit up.\\
324 - Come on here. Fred, up.\\
325 - You know how to sit up.\\
326 - You know how to sit up.
Come on, honey.\\
327 - Never mind the lovemaking.\\
328 - Just come on, now. Sit up.\\
329 - I want you to sit up.\\
330 - Now, pay attention. Up, boy.\\
331 - Up.\\
332 - Aw, come on, now.
You know how to it.\\
333 - Look. Like this. See? Like this.\\
334 - I guess he just doesn't feel like
sitting up right now.\\
335 - No, I guess not.\\
336 - Well, actually, sitting up wasn't his
best subject.\\
337 - Oh?\\
338 - No. Let's try speaking.\\
339 - Here we go now.\\
340 - All right, Fred, pay attention now.\\
341 - All right, speak!\\
342 - Speak, boy!\\
343 - Speak! Fred?\\
344 - Speak, speak, speak!\\
345 - Come on, say something.\\
346 - Talk up a storm, boy!\\
347 - Come on. Say something.\\
348 - Speak, Fred!\\
349 - Come on, say something for me.\\
350 - Just a couple of words, huh?\\
351 - Oh, now, Fred, stop.\\
352 - Come on. Speak.\\
353 - I guess he didn't head his class in
speaking either.\\
354 - Well, actually, he isn't supposed to
speak\\
355 - unless he wants something, you know,
like his dinner.\\
356 - Oh. Oh, I see.\\
357 - He's a before-dinner speaker.\\
358 - Yeah, well.\\
359 - Here's something he does very well.\\
360 - Now, watch.\\
361 - Okay, Fred.\\
362 - Now, roll over and play dead!\\
363 - Come on, Fred.\\
364 - Come on now, roll over and play dead.\\
365 - Come on. Roll over and play dead,
boy.\\
366 - Come on. Down you go.
Play dead.\\
367 - Fred...\\
368 - Come on now, roll over and play dead,
boy.\\
369 - Fred, pay attention to me.\\
370 - Look. Look, Fred. Fred...\\
371 - Like this.\\
372 - Are you sure they didn't give him the
diploma\\
373 - just to get rid of him?\\
374 - Well, I don't understand it.\\
375 - He did everything beautifully for the
instructor at school.\\
376 - Look, I'm gonna give you one more
chance here.\\
377 - Now, you stand up there.\\
378 - Now, Fred, pay attention!\\
379 - Go get it, boy!\\
380 - Fred, go get it.\\
381 - Fred! Go get it!\\
382 - Fetch the paper, Frederick.\\
383 - Can't you do just one trick, for me,
Fred? Come on.\\
384 - Fred, look.\\
385 - Nice Lucy.\\
386 - Nice Lucy.\\
387 - Here. You deserve this more than he
does.\\
388 - Well, he just must be exhausted\\
389 - for cramming for all of his exams,
that's all.\\
390 - He needs a vacation.\\
391 - Good. Then he can go out in the
doghouse\\
392 - and then he can take his vacation.\\
393 - He doesn't like it out there.\\
394 - Well, that's too bad.\\
395 - But if he's not smart enough to
learn, how...\\
396 - Shh! Don't talk like that in front of
Fred.\\
397 - You'll hurt his feelings.\\
398 - Come on, Fred.\\
399 - Fred.\\
400 - Fred!\\
401 - Oh, Fred!\\
402 - You big bully.\\
403 - Now, what were you saying?\\
404 - I was saying that if he's not smart
enough to mind,\\
405 - he can stay in the doghouse.\\
406 - You're mean!\\
407 - Since when is mean for a dog\\
408 - to stay in his doghouse?\\
409 - When the dog doesn't like the
doghouse,\\
410 - he's not happy out there.\\
411 - Why shouldn't he be happy out there?\\
412 - It's a beautiful doghouse.\\
413 - It's very roomy.\\
414 - It's brand-new.\\
415 - It doesn't have a mortgage.\\
416 - And he doesn't have a wife to nag
him.\\
417 - Oh, there's no talking to you.\\
418 - I have things to do.\\
419 - We'll discuss this later.\\
420 - Fellow citizens of Westport,\\
421 - we are gathered here on Yankee
Doodle...\\
422 - Oh, no!\\
423 - Oh, you naughty dog!\\
424 - What's the matter?\\
425 - He licked half of the cold cuts on
that platter!\\
426 - Where are you going?\\
427 - I'm going to put him out\\
428 - in the doghouse where he belongs!\\
429 - ...On Doodle Dandy Day to dedicate...\\
430 - Ethel, wait till you see it.\\
431 - Mr. Silvestri did a wonderful job.\\
432 - Oh, I can hardly wait!\\
433 - Oh, it's really...
It's just beautiful.\\
434 - Are you ready?\\
435 - Yeah.\\
436 - Oh!\\
437 - Oh, it's pretty lifelike, isn't it?\\
438 - Oh, I should say it is.\\
439 - I thought I saw him squeeze the
trigger.\\
440 - Ha, ha!\\
441 - Isn't it great?\\
442 - It is just great!\\
443 - When do you take it over to Jessup
Green?\\
444 - Well, I'm going to get it there\\
445 - just a few minutes before Ricky does
the unveiling.\\
446 - That way nobody will be able to peek
at it\\
447 - before the ceremony.\\
448 - Where is Ricky?\\
449 - He's over at the newspaper office.\\
450 - They're taking some pictures\\
451 - for the Yankee Doodle Day
celebration.\\
452 - Mommy! Mommy!\\
453 - What?\\
454 - Fred ran away!\\
455 - Fred ran away?\\
456 - Which Fred?\\
457 - My dog!\\
458 - Oh, nuts.\\
459 - Are you sure?\\
460 - Are you sure he ran away?\\
461 - His rope's chewed up,\\
462 - and there's a hole in the fence.\\
463 - Oh, dear. It's my fault for putting
him\\
464 - out there in that doghouse.\\
465 - Now, honey, he's around here
someplace.\\
466 - We'll find him.
Oh, dear.\\
467 - Fred!
Fred!\\
468 - Fred!
Fred!\\
469 - Fred!
Fred!\\
470 - Fred!
Fred?\\
471 - What do you want?\\
472 - Oh, not you.\\
473 - We're calling the dog.\\
474 - He ran away.\\
475 - Oh, Mommy, where is he?\\
476 - We'll find him, honey. I promise.\\
477 - Don't worry, honey.\\
478 - Fred!\\
479 - Lucy, your phone's ringing.
Lucy..\\
480 - What?\\
481 - Your phone.
Your phone.\\
482 - You keep looking.
We will, honey.\\
483 - Fred!\\
484 - Fred!
Fred!\\
485 - Hello.\\
486 - Oh, hello, Grace.\\
487 - Yeah.\\
488 - Yeah, we just found out a minute ago.\\
489 - He did?\\
490 - Which way did he go?\\
491 - Oh. Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Grace.\\
492 - Oh, dear!\\
493 - Fred.\\
494 - Fred! Fred!\\
495 - Can't you hear me?\\
496 - Yeah, I can hear you.\\
497 - Well, why didn't you answer?\\
498 - I thought you were calling the dog.\\
499 - Oh, for heaven's sakes.\\
500 - Tell Ethel and Ricky to come in here
right away.\\
501 - Ethel!
Yes?\\
502 - Come on.
Lucy wants you.\\
503 - What's up?\\
504 - Grace Munson just called and said\\
505 - that she saw a dog that looked like
Fred\\
506 - running up the road past her house.\\
507 - Oh! That's almost a mile away from
here!\\
508 - Maybe it wasn't our Fred.\\
509 - Well, we gotta track down every lead.\\
510 - Now, listen, I'm gonna drive over to
the Munsons'.\\
511 - You go out and get Bruce Ramsey,
honey.\\
512 - Look all around the neighborhood.\\
513 - Hear?
Okay, Mommy.\\
514 - You stay here in case there're\\
515 - any more calls, will you, Ethel?\\
516 - Oh, sure.\\
517 - Lucy, you call us, now, if you find
him.\\
518 - Yeah, I will.
I'll look around here.\\
519 - Maybe he's hiding inside.\\
520 - I'll look in the kitchen.\\
521 - Fred!\\
522 - What?\\
523 - I'm calling the dog.\\
524 - Oh, for corn sakes.\\
525 - I haven't been right once today.\\
526 - Maybe it'd make things simpler\\
527 - if you changed your name.\\
528 - To what?\\
529 - Rover.\\
530 - Very funny!\\
531 - I'll go and look in the den.\\
532 - I'll go upstairs and look, Fred.\\
533 - Hey!
What was that?\\
534 - Something sounded like a wreck out
there in back.\\
535 - No, no. It was out here, Fred.\\
536 - No, it was in back.\\
537 - I know it was out there.\\
538 - My ear tells me it's in the back.\\
539 - It sounded just like it was out
front.\\
540 - It's out back!
Now go on!\\
541 - Lucy, are you all right?\\
542 - I'm all right, but look at him.\\
543 - Oh, my goodness, honey.\\
544 - What happened?\\
545 - Oh, I jumped in the car\\
546 - and forgot all about the trailer\\
547 - and backed right into that elm tree.\\
548 - Wouldn't you know it?\\
549 - The poor guy got through the
Revolutionary War\\
550 - without a scratch,\\
551 - but five minutes with you and he's
finished.\\
552 - Oh, be quiet, Fred.\\
553 - Uh, Lucy, maybe we can glue it back
together.\\
554 - Glue what back together?\\
555 - This is all that's left of him.\\
556 - Oh, my goodness.\\
557 - Well, you gotta do something.\\
558 - You've got to fix it.\\
559 - Oh, how can I fix it, for heaven's
sake?\\
560 - Doesn't look very good.\\
561 - Lucy.
What?\\
562 - The unveiling's in an hour.\\
563 - What are you gonnna do?\\
564 - Oh, dear, I don't know.\\
565 - But while I'm thinking,\\
566 - will you drive over to the Munsons',\\
567 - find Little Ricky and go find the
dog, will you?\\
568 - Sure.
Yeah.\\
569 - Oh...\\
570 - See you later, shorty.\\
571 - Ethel, what am I gonna do?\\
572 - They'll throw me out of the
Historical Society.\\
573 - Oh, you'll be lucky\\
574 - if they don't throw you out of town.\\
575 - Oh, dear.\\
576 - Hey, I'll call Mr. Silvestri\\
577 - and see if he's got another one.\\
578 - Another one?\\
579 - They don't make statues in pairs like
bookends.\\
580 - Oh, it doesn't hurt to ask.\\
581 - Mr. Silvestri?\\
582 - This is Mrs. Ricardo.\\
583 - Yeah. You know the statue you made
for us?\\
584 - Well, by any chance, do you happen to
have a spare?\\
585 - Oh, you don't, huh?\\
586 - Well, could you make another one?\\
587 - Oh, good!\\
588 - How long will it take?\\
589 - Two weeks!\\
590 - Oh, dear.\\
591 - Well, could you make it sooner?\\
592 - Well, I was thinking in about an
hour, maybe?\\
593 - Yeah, well, all right, all right, all
right, Mr. Silvestri.\\
594 - Well, you start on it right now, huh?\\
595 - Yeah. What?\\
596 - Why do I want another one?\\
597 - Why? Why?\\
598 - Why, Ethel?\\
599 - Why do we want two of them?\\
600 - Uh... well...
Westport is growing\\
601 - and it may become twin cities\\
602 - like Saint Paul and Minneapolis.\\
603 - Yeah, well, you know, Mr. Silvestri,\\
604 - Westport is growing so, it just might
become twin cities\\
605 - like Saint Appolis and Minnie Paul.\\
606 - Minneapolis and Saint Paul.\\
607 - Oh.\\
608 - Well, you just go ahead, Mr.
Silvestri,\\
609 - and we'll think up a reason later.\\
610 - I mean, I'll tell you the reason
later. Yeah.\\
611 - Oh, uh, Mr. Silvestri,\\
612 - incidentally, is the, uh, the first
statue insured?\\
613 - Oh! Oh, thank goodness!\\
614 - Yeah, well, just start on the...\\
615 - on the other one.\\
616 - Thanks very much.\\
617 - Oh! Thank goodness that's over.\\
618 - Now all you have to do\\
619 - is postpone the ceremonies for two
weeks.\\
620 - Yeah.\\
621 - Postpone the...?\\
622 - I can't postpone the ceremonies!\\
623 - Everybody in town will be over there
in an hour.\\
624 - Well, what are you gonna do?\\
625 - I don't know. I forgot all about the
ceremonies.\\
626 - Oh, dear.\\
627 - Oh, Ethel.\\
628 - Hey, I got an idea.\\
629 - No, maybe it's too wild.\\
630 - If you've got an idea that you think
is too wild,\\
631 - I don't want to hear it.\\
632 - No, I think it will work.\\
633 - Yeah, I think so.\\
634 - You know, we're going to have\\
635 - ice cream and cake later.\\
636 - Are you having a good time, honey?\\
637 - Yes.\\
638 - Fred! Fred, you found Fred!\\
639 - Oh, let him through here. Oh, Fred!\\
640 - Yeah, I found him.
I found him all right.\\
641 - Oh, bless his little heart.\\
642 - Where was he?\\
643 - Well, you will never believe it.\\
644 - He was sitting on the steps\\
645 - of the obedience school.\\
646 - Oh, Fred.\\
647 - Now, why do you suppose he went
there?\\
648 - Well, I guess he heard he had a bad
report.\\
649 - He was trying to sign up for summer
school.\\
650 - Oh, maybe.\\
651 - Your mommy's here, honey.\\
652 - You'll see her pretty soon.\\
653 - And your daddy's getting ready to
make a speech.\\
654 - Did you know that?
Yeah.\\
655 - Fellow citizens of Westport,\\
656 - we are gathered here on Yankee Doodle
Day\\
657 - to unveil and dedicate a statue--\\
658 - a statue which commemorates\\
659 - the great bravery and daring courage\\
660 - of the patriots of this community\\
661 - during the Battle of Campo in 1777.\\
662 - So I hereby dedicate this statue to
these brave men and women,\\
663 - and to their descendants,\\
664 - many of whom are still living in this
community.\\
665 - And now, for the unveiling.\\
666 - Here we go!\\
667 - Lucy?\\
668 - Lucy!\\
669 - Shoot, if you must, this old redhead.\\
670 - Un momento, un momento que ha pasado
algo...\\
