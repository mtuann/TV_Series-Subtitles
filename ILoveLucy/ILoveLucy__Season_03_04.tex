26 - Such a good boy.\\
27 - We take our nap now, huh?\\
28 - Should we take our nap now?\\
29 - (mouthing words)\\
30 - Good morning, Lucy.\\
31 - Oh, hi.\\
32 - I brought up your mail.\\
33 - Oh, thank you very much.\\
34 - Oh! Oh, Ethel, look!\\
35 - Life, the magazine--\\
36 - the one with our pictures in it.\\
37 - Is this the one with your pictures in
it?\\
38 - Yeah, well, let me have it now.\\
39 - Well, I'll find 'em for you.\\
40 - Honey, I can find it.\\
41 - It's my magazine and my pictures are
in it.\\
42 - "Life visits an orchestra leader at
home"-- page 43.\\
43 - Oh, I'm so excited.\\
44 - I wonder what my hair looks like.\\
45 - Oh, you know, the beauty parlor did\\
46 - a whole new makeup on me that day.\\
47 - Yeah, I know.\\
48 - All right, all right.\\
49 - Oh, and I had on a new dress.\\
50 - Oh! Oh, here it is.\\
51 - Isn't that wonderful?\\
52 - Oh, that's just great!\\
53 - Look, Ricky practicing at the piano.\\
54 - Oh, doesn't he look great?\\
55 - Look at that expression.\\
56 - Oh, here he is making arroz con pollo
in the kitchen.\\
57 - I've seen him like that a dozen
times.\\
58 - Doesn't that look natural?\\
59 - Oh, look at the baby.\\
60 - Oh, isn't he a little doll?\\
61 - Yeah.\\
62 - Oh, here's Ricky teaching Little
Ricky\\
63 - to play the conga drum.\\
64 - I didn't know they took one like
that.\\
65 - Isn't that wonderful?
That's awful cute.\\
66 - (gasps)\\
67 - Look at that big picture of Ricky.\\
68 - Isn't that wonderful?\\
69 - Oh, yeah.\\
70 - That's all?\\
71 - I must have missed something.\\
72 - No, that's all.\\
73 - Gee, three whole pages of pictures!\\
74 - Well, so what happened to me?\\
75 - There are no pictures of me there.\\
76 - Oh, yes, there are.
I saw them.\\
77 - You did not.\\
78 - I did, too.\\
79 - You were in this, uh... Uh...\\
80 - Yeah, there you are.\\
81 - Where?\\
82 - There-- holding the baby.\\
83 - Oh, great.\\
84 - That's a fine picture of my left arm.\\
85 - Oh, come now.\\
86 - And after all the trouble I went
through.\\
87 - I told all my friends to look for
pictures of me.\\
88 - Now, Lucy.\\
89 - If they don't recognize my left arm,
I'm dead.\\
90 - Oh, it isn't everybody\\
91 - who gets her arm in Life magazine.\\
92 - Oh, I don't want my arm in there.\\
93 - I want my face in there.\\
94 - For heaven's sake.\\
95 - If I'd known what they were up to,\\
96 - I'd have held the baby in my mouth.\\
97 - Hey, 20 million people read this
magazine.\\
98 - Why, your arm will be famous.\\
99 - Thanks.\\
100 - Oh, don't be so unhappy.\\
101 - Think of how much good it'll do
Ricky's career.\\
102 - Oh, sure, what about my career?\\
103 - You don't have a career.\\
104 - Exactly, and why?\\
105 - Publicity like this.\\
106 - Oh, now, Lucy.\\
107 - It's a wonder I've got where I am.\\
108 - Where are you?\\
109 - Oh, shut up!\\
110 - (door buzzer sounds)\\
111 - Who's that?\\
112 - Hi, honey!\\
113 - We made it!\\
114 - We made it!\\
115 - Look! Look!\\
116 - It's all over the place!\\
117 - We're in Life magazine!\\
118 - Yes, I saw us.\\
119 - Oh, isn't that wonder...?
How about that?\\
120 - Oh, it's just wonderful, Ricky.\\
121 - We got more pages than the two-headed
alligator.\\
122 - And the wonderful pictures of the
baby?\\
123 - Yeah, wonderful.
Oh, boy.\\
124 - Look at the picture of me at the
piano.\\
125 - Isn't that good?\\
126 - I got kind of a funny expression on
my face, though.\\
127 - Oh, I don't know.\\
128 - It isn't as funny as the expression
on my elbow.\\
129 - Huh?\\
130 - How did you like the pictures of me,
dear?\\
131 - Oh, beautiful, honey.\\
132 - I thought you never looked better.\\
133 - Oh, thank you.\\
134 - Oh, we ought to be\\
135 - the happiest two people in the whole
world.\\
136 - Well, the happiest one and a quarter
anyway.\\
137 - What do you mean?\\
138 - I hate to be the one to point this
out, Ricky,\\
139 - but there's a certain loved one\\
140 - whose picture does not appear in
there.\\
141 - Who?\\
142 - Me.\\
143 - Oh, now, don't be silly, you're in
here.\\
144 - I am?\\
145 - Sure...\\
146 - Oh, that's right, you're not.\\
147 - (in mocking tone:)
Oh, that's right, you're not.\\
148 - Well, gee, I'm sorry.\\
149 - You don't have to get mad at me.\\
150 - It's not my fault.\\
151 - It is, too.\\
152 - How can it be my fault?\\
153 - They would have printed my picture,\\
154 - but they didn't because I'm not
famous,\\
155 - and the only reason I'm not famous\\
156 - is because you've never given me an
opportunity\\
157 - to display my talents.\\
158 - Oh, no.\\
159 - Now, Ricky, you listen to me...\\
160 - Now, you listen to me.\\
161 - If you don't mind,\\
162 - I don't want to listen to either of
you.\\
163 - Now, no low blows and watch your
kidney punches.\\
164 - Go to your corners,\\
165 - and when the door slams, come out
fighting.\\
166 - And may the best man win.\\
167 - (door slams)\\
168 - Now, Ricky...
Now. listen...\\
169 - I don't want to go into a long
discussion\\
170 - of why you should be in show
business.\\
171 - I will save you a lot of time and a
lot of breath.\\
172 - I will give you an answer right now:
no.\\
173 - But I want a career.\\
174 - You have a career.\\
175 - Being a mother is very important, you
know.\\
176 - I know that, and it's only because of
Little Ricky\\
177 - that I want to get my break in show
business.\\
178 - Well, I know I'm going to be sorry I
asked this,\\
179 - but how do you figure?\\
180 - Well, you just think ahead a little
bit.\\
181 - When Little Ricky goes to school\\
182 - and some of his playmates asks\\
183 - who his parents are...
Yeah?\\
184 - just what is he going to have to say?\\
185 - "My father is Ricky Ricardo,\\
186 - "the internationally known
entertainer,\\
187 - "and then there's my mother,\\
188 - whose name escapes me for the
moment."\\
189 - Oh, the poor, poor child.\\
190 - Yeah, well.
(baby cries)\\
191 - You see?
He heard me.\\
192 - He's so humiliated he's crying
already.\\
193 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
194 - Hiya, Fred.\\
195 - Hey!\\
196 - Aren't you the fella\\
197 - that I saw in Life's magazine today?\\
198 - Gosh!\\
199 - Could I get your autograph?\\
200 - Oh, shut up, Fred.\\
201 - What's the matter, Rick?\\
202 - Gosh, I thought you'd be feeling
great\\
203 - after all that publicity.\\
204 - Well, do you happen to notice that
they didn't put\\
205 - one of Lucy's pictures in the
magazine?\\
206 - So what? The spread was about you.\\
207 - Well, that's what she's mad about.\\
208 - She said if I hadn't kept her out of
show business,\\
209 - the spread would have been about both
of us.\\
210 - Oh, now, don't tell me:\\
211 - So she wants to get the act again,
huh?\\
212 - To put it mildly, yeah.\\
213 - Well, it's all your own fault.\\
214 - Not you, too.\\
215 - Well, I've always felt\\
216 - that you handled the thing wrong,
Rick.\\
217 - Huh?\\
218 - How much did Lucy pay you\\
219 - to come in here and say that?\\
220 - Oh, now, don't get me wrong.\\
221 - She's like a million other people\\
222 - that are trying to break into show
business.\\
223 - All they see is the glamour and the
stardom.\\
224 - So?\\
225 - So, why don't you give her a job,\\
226 - and let her see\\
227 - how much good, hard work there is in
it?\\
228 - Hey...\\
229 - you might got something there.\\
230 - Yeah.\\
231 - That's a wonderful idea.\\
232 - Sure.\\
233 - Yes, sir.\\
234 - I think that's a good idea.\\
235 - I will give her a job in the show.\\
236 - Sure, give her a job-- even if it's a
job in the chorus.\\
237 - Please, Fred, how dare you say that?\\
238 - I'll make her a star.\\
239 - Then she'll really find out what hard
work is.\\
240 - Mmm, Ricky, you can be a meanie when
you want to be.\\
241 - Listen, I'll tell you what.\\
242 - Yeah?\\
243 - Go over to your apartment\\
244 - and call me on the telephone, will
you?\\
245 - Okay. Who am I supposed to be?\\
246 - It doesn't matter.
Just ring and then I'll take it from
there.\\
247 - All right.
Okay?\\
248 - All right.
Thank you, Fred.\\
249 - You're welcome.\\
250 - (chuckles)\\
251 - Hurry up.\\
252 - I will.\\
253 - (mouthing words)\\
254 - (phone rings)\\
255 - Hello?\\
256 - What do you mean, I need one more
dancer?\\
257 - Oh, I see.\\
258 - Well, what do you want-- a blond or a
brunette?\\
259 - Oh, a redhead.\\
260 - I see.\\
261 - A redhead.\\
262 - Well, I don't know.\\
263 - I think I'd rather have a brunette.\\
264 - Well...\\
265 - maybe you're right.\\
266 - Maybe a redhead would be better.\\
267 - Yeah.\\
268 - Listen, how tall a dancer do you
want?\\
269 - A small one?\\
270 - Oh, a tall one, huh?\\
271 - Well, look,\\
272 - in comparison to my height,\\
273 - where should she come to?\\
274 - Here or here...?\\
275 - I mean, I don't see exactly what you
mean.\\
276 - Oh, right about here.\\
277 - Uh-huh.\\
278 - Well, if I can think of anybody,\\
279 - I'll give you a ring.\\
280 - All right, good-bye, Jerry.\\
281 - Good-bye.\\
282 - Look, Ricky-- medium height, red hair\\
283 - and a dancing fool.\\
284 - You couldn't possibly mean you\\
285 - for the dancing part in the show?\\
286 - Ricky, please?\\
287 - Please, baby doll, please?\\
288 - Oh, no, no, honey.\\
289 - That's completely out of the
question.\\
290 - Oh, but why?\\
291 - Well... well, I must admit\\
292 - that physically you are just right
for it.\\
293 - Uh...\\
294 - No, no.\\
295 - But you just said I was just right.\\
296 - Yeah, I know, but, honey, it's a big
part.\\
297 - It's-It's a lot of dancing in it.\\
298 - Very... a lot of hard work.\\
299 - You couldn't take it.\\
300 - Oh, yes, I could.\\
301 - I'll work day and night.
I know I could.\\
302 - I'm ready, coach.
Send me in.\\
303 - Well...\\
304 - Okay, you talked me into it.\\
305 - Oh, Ricky!
You're wonderful!\\
306 - Oh, thank you, honey.\\
307 - (playing upbeat big-band number)\\
308 - Okay, boys.\\
309 - Lucy!\\
310 - Are you ready to rehearse your
number?\\
311 - LUCY: Yeah, I'm coming.\\
312 - Ladies and gentlemen,\\
313 - our new star!\\
314 - (cheering)\\
315 - ("The Sidewalks of New York" plays)\\
316 - Oh!\\
317 - Oh, I got a little crick in my
muscle.\\
318 - You know, I've been working awful
hard.\\
319 - She sure has, Ricky.\\
320 - We've been rehearsing six hours a day\\
321 - for the last three days.\\
322 - Well, good, good.\\
323 - Oh, I liked it, though.\\
324 - I liked every minute of it.\\
325 - Well, that's fine, because I'd like\\
326 - to rehearse your number right now.\\
327 - Do you know, do you know the number?\\
328 - Well, I learned all the steps,\\
329 - but I haven't gone through the whole
routine.\\
330 - I see. Well, it's what we call a
challenge routine.\\
331 - What?\\
332 - A challenge routine.\\
333 - You see, I do a step,\\
334 - and then when I finish, I go like
this\\
335 - and that means you take it.\\
336 - Then you do a step,\\
337 - and when you finish, you go like
that,\\
338 - and that means that I take it.\\
339 - Uh-huh.
And so on.\\
340 - Oh, I've seen them do that.\\
341 - Well, there's nothing to it.\\
342 - Uh, yeah.
Okay, are you ready?\\
343 - Uh-huh.
Okay.\\
344 - All right, boys, we start the
challenge routine off\\
345 - from the very top.
Come over here.\\
346 - The entrance, you stand behind me,
see,\\
347 - and you start with the right foot.\\
348 - Yeah, I know.
All right?\\
349 - Boys, are you ready?\\
350 - One, two!\\
351 - (fast two-step plays)\\
352 - (slow soft-shoe number plays)\\
353 - (fast swing music plays)\\
354 - (soft-shoe number continues)\\
355 - (swing music continues)\\
356 - (soft-shoe number continues)\\
357 - (swing music continues)\\
358 - (music stops)\\
359 - Listen, how come I'm doing all the
dancing?\\
360 - Well, honey, you are the star.\\
361 - Oh, that's right.\\
362 - (swing music continues)\\
363 - (soft-shoe number continues)\\
364 - (swing music continues)\\
365 - What's the matter?\\
366 - Nothing.\\
367 - I'm fine.\\
368 - Well, that's good, you know.\\
369 - We've got to learn this number today.\\
370 - We've got about two more hours of
rehearsal yet.\\
371 - That's all right.
Go ahead, I'm ready.\\
372 - All right.\\
373 - Okay, on your feet now.
Let's go.\\
374 - (moans)\\
375 - Here, here, I'll help you, honey.\\
376 - Up you go. Come on.
Up you go.\\
377 - Oh... Up she goes.\\
378 - Oh!\\
379 - Oop!\\
380 - Now, here we go now.\\
381 - Let's get up.\\
382 - You all right?\\
383 - Yes, sir.\\
384 - Okay.\\
385 - Let's take it from the very top.\\
386 - All right?\\
387 - It's no use, boy, I can't do it.\\
388 - I can't do it.\\
389 - Here, honey, I'll help you up.\\
390 - Up...
up you go now.\\
391 - Up.\\
392 - Now, you see, honey, I was afraid of
this.\\
393 - You see, all you were thinking was\\
394 - about the glamour and the stardom.\\
395 - You never realized how much hard work\\
396 - goes into show business.\\
397 - Yeah, I guess you're right.\\
398 - I'm sorry I let you down.\\
399 - I'd just like to go home and rest,
thank you.\\
400 - All right, honey.\\
401 - Look, now, don't forget...\\
402 - don't forget I gave you your big
chance.\\
403 - Oh, yes, honey.
You were wonderful.\\
404 - I'm pooped.\\
405 - Now, honey...
Honey, I...\\
406 - I wish there was something else\\
407 - for you to do in the show,\\
408 - but there isn't, you know.\\
409 - Oh, that's all right.
I understand.\\
410 - Hey, Ricky, you still need a girl\\
411 - in that balcony during the Spanish
scene.\\
412 - What girl?\\
413 - What balcony?\\
414 - Honey, honey, honey, look, look,
look...\\
415 - What girl?\\
416 - Honey, you wouldn't like it.\\
417 - Look, all she does is just sit in the
balcony\\
418 - and holds a rose in her teeth.\\
419 - All she does is just sit there?\\
420 - Yeah.\\
421 - Can I do it, Ricky?\\
422 - Oh, you wouldn't want to do that,
honey.\\
423 - Oh, yes, I would, yes, I would.
Really.\\
424 - I told everybody I was going to be in
the show,\\
425 - and I promise if you let me do it
this time,\\
426 - I'll never ask you again.\\
427 - Look, I'm a real good sitter, see?\\
428 - You really promise?\\
429 - I promise.\\
430 - Okay.\\
431 - Oh, thank you, thank you.\\
432 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
433 - Hi. What are you two doing here?
Hi, Luce.\\
434 - Where's Mrs. Trumbull?\\
435 - She had to go visit her sister\\
436 - so Fred and I are baby-sitting.\\
437 - Oh, swell.
How is the baby?\\
438 - He's fine.
He's still asleep.\\
439 - Oh, that's good.\\
440 - (sighs)\\
441 - How's the rehearsal going?\\
442 - Fine.\\
443 - What's that for?\\
444 - My part in the show.\\
445 - See, I sit up on the balcony and hold
a rose in my teeth\\
446 - and Ricky sings a number to me.\\
447 - Is that all you do in the show?\\
448 - Well, it's a very important part.\\
449 - The whole number revolves around me.\\
450 - I didn't think he'd have nerve enough
to go through with it.\\
451 - Go through with what?\\
452 - Well, he was going to pretend to star
you in a big dance number\\
453 - and then rehearse you so hard you'd
get tired and quit.\\
454 - What?\\
455 - Well, don't get sore.
He didn't do it.\\
456 - The heck he didn't!\\
457 - And thanks for telling me.\\
458 - Me and my big blabbermouth.\\
459 - So, he let me do all that dancing\\
460 - and he had no intention of putting me
in the show, huh?\\
461 - But you said you were in the show.\\
462 - Oh, sure, all I do is sit there and
hold a rose.\\
463 - I might as well be a vase.\\
464 - But you said you had a big important
part\\
465 - and you said you were doing all
right.\\
466 - What do you do, write down everything
I say?\\
467 - I'll get even with him, the bum!\\
468 - Oh, Lucy...\\
469 - do me a favor, will you?\\
470 - Don't tell Ricky I told you.\\
471 - Fred, I'll do you a favor on one
condition:\\
472 - What's that, I'm afraid?\\
473 - You will help me get even with him.\\
474 - Uh-oh.\\
475 - Listen, I remember you told me\\
476 - about a vaudeville act you used to
have.\\
477 - Now, there's a certain part of that
act\\
478 - that I think I can use...\\
479 - if you will enlighten me on a few
facts.\\
480 - (harp plays)\\
481 - (playing "Lady of Spain")\\
482 - RICKY: Night in Madrid, blue and
tender\\
483 - Spanish moon made silver splendor\\
484 - Music throbbing plaintive, sobbing
notes\\
485 - Of a guitar\\
486 - While ardent caballeros serenade.\\
487 - Lady of Spain, I adore you\\
488 - Right from the night I first saw you\\
489 - My heart has been yearning for you\\
490 - What else could any heart do?\\
491 - (enthusiastic applause)\\
492 - Lady of Spain, I'm appealing\\
493 - Why should my lips be concealing\\
494 - All that my eyes are revealing?\\
495 - Lady of Spain, I love you.\\
496 - (applause)\\
497 - Paso doble, paso doble.\\
498 - ("Lady of Spain" plays faster)\\
499 - Lady of Spain, I'm appealing\\
500 - Why should my lips be concealing?\\
501 - All that my eyes are revealing\\
502 - Lady of Spain, I love you.\\
503 - (enthusiastic applause)\\
504 - Thank you.\\
505 - "Loveliest Night of the Year."\\
506 - When you are in love\\
507 - It's the loveliest night of the year\\
508 - Stars twinkle above\\
509 - And you almost can touch them from
here\\
510 - Words fall into rhyme\\
511 - Every time you are holding me near\\
512 - When you are in love\\
513 - It's the loveliest night of the year\\
514 - (music swells)\\
515 - Waltzing along in the blue\\
516 - Like a breeze drifting over the sand\\
517 - Thrilled by the wonder of you\\
518 - And the wonderful touch of your hand\\
519 - And...\\
520 - My heart starts to beat\\
521 - Like a child when a birthday is near\\
522 - So kiss me, my sweet\\
523 - It's the loveliest night of the
year...\\
524 - Don't you touch those wires!\\
525 - Don't you touch those wires!\\
526 - Let me down!\\
527 - Ladies... don't you touch those
wires!\\
528 - Ladies and gentlemen, my version of
"Babalu."\\
529 - Ay-ay-ay-ay.\\

\subsection {Episode 02: The Girls Go Into Business}
1 - (I Love Lucy theme music plays)\\
2 - Did you have a nice time\\
3 - shopping with Mama and Aunt Ethel?\\
4 - You were such a good boy.\\
5 - Now we're going to get our coat off\\
6 - and we're going to have a big dinner\\
7 - and you can sit here and play while
Mama changes her clothes.\\
8 - Will you be a good boy?\\
9 - There you are, tanny right up there.\\
10 - That's a fella.\\
11 - Tanny right up there, we take the
coat off.\\
12 - Him was such a good boy.\\
13 - You tired, baby?\\
14 - Little baby tired?\\
15 - Tanny up... tanny up, Ricky.\\
16 - There we go.\\
17 - Let go.\\
18 - That's it.\\
19 - Now, you play, play.\\
20 - There you go, honey.\\
21 - I'll be right back.\\
22 - Give me mine.\\
23 - Oh, wasn't that a wonderful break we
went by Hansen's\\
24 - during their selling-out sale?\\
25 - Uh-huh. I wonder why she's giving up
that dress shop.\\
26 - Oh, I don't know, but I'm glad she
is.\\
27 - Oh, did you ever see such a bargain?\\
28 - Never.\\
29 - And Ricky thinks I don't know how to
save money.\\
30 - Why, I saved $10 on this dress alone.\\
31 - I saved seven on mine.\\
32 - That's $17 we saved today.\\
33 - What'll we spend it on?\\
34 - How about buying hats?\\
35 - Oh, wonderful-- they actually won't
cost us a cent.\\
36 - Gee, won't our husbands be proud of
us?\\
37 - Yeah. Let's wear these dresses
tonight and show 'em, huh?\\
38 - Oh, no, I won't get to wear mine\\
39 - for a couple of months yet.\\
40 - What do you mean you won't get to
wear yours\\
41 - for a couple of months yet?\\
42 - when I buy a new dress?
Yeah.\\
43 - Well, I just hang this away in the
closet\\
44 - for a couple of months\\
45 - and then I take it out and wear it\\
46 - and Ricky says, "Is that a new
dress?"\\
47 - And I say, "No, it's been hanging\\
48 - in the closet for months."\\
49 - Oh, you're the sneaky one.\\
50 - Yeah.\\
51 - See you later.\\
52 - Bye-bye.\\
53 - Yes, sir, and do you know\\
54 - how many steps he took yesterday?\\
55 - Six?\\
56 - No.\\
57 - Seven?\\
58 - No, two.\\
59 - No kidding.
Oh, really?\\
60 - Honestly-- I got so excited\\
61 - that I called Ricky down at the club,\\
62 - didn't I, dear?\\
63 - Huh?\\
64 - What's the matter with you?\\
65 - Nothing.\\
66 - There is, too.\\
67 - Ever since you came home,\\
68 - you've been sitting there in a Cuban
funk.\\
69 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
70 - It's this crazy business that I'm in\\
71 - that's getting me down.\\
72 - There's no sense to show business.\\
73 - He gets like this every once in a
while.\\
74 - What's the matter, dear?\\
75 - Did you have a tough day?\\
76 - Every day is a tough day.\\
77 - Everybody wants more money,\\
78 - everybody wants better billing.\\
79 - You have to put up\\
80 - with all these crazy, temperamental
people.\\
81 - If there's one thing that I can't
stand,\\
82 - it's temperamental people\\
83 - yelling and screaming all the time!!\\
84 - Why do they have to yell and scream?!\\
85 - Why can't they do business\\
86 - in a normal, sensible manner like I
do?!\\
87 - Well, I don't know, dear.\\
88 - Perhaps it's because they're not calm\\
89 - and even-tempered like you are.\\
90 - Yeah.\\
91 - Well, the whole thing is not worth
it.\\
92 - I mean, it's not worth it.\\
93 - When you are through, you've got
nothing. Nothing.\\
94 - You got nothing going for you.\\
95 - What have I got going for me?
Nothing.\\
96 - I got nothing going for me.\\
97 - Oh, you have, too, Ricky.\\
98 - You're a big, important star.\\
99 - Sure.
Certainly.\\
100 - Well, I mean, show business is not
like any other business.\\
101 - You know, in another business, if you
get sick, let's say...\\
102 - maybe you own a store, people working
for you.\\
103 - It takes care of itself, you don't
have to worry.\\
104 - You get sick, you stay home, you
enjoy being sick.\\
105 - You're the smart one, Fred.\\
106 - Fred?!\\
107 - Fred?!\\
108 - Me?!\\
109 - Sure! You saved your money and you
bought this building.\\
110 - Well, that's true.\\
111 - Now all you got to do\\
112 - is just sit back and watch the money\\
113 - roll in.\\
114 - (spluttering)\\
115 - All right, so it's not a million
dollars,\\
116 - but you got security.\\
117 - That's what I ought to do.\\
118 - I ought to get myself a little
business.\\
119 - That's a wonderful idea, Ricky.\\
120 - Hey, we've got a couple of bucks
saved up.\\
121 - Maybe we could go in partners with
them.\\
122 - Yeah!
Really?\\
123 - What kind of business\\
124 - did you have in mind?\\
125 - Well, gee, I don't know...\\
126 - I do-- Hansen's Dress Shop.\\
127 - Yes! It's for sale.\\
128 - You know that little store in the
middle of the next block?\\
129 - LUCY: It's a gold mine right here in
our own neighborhood.\\
130 - Now, now, wait a minute, Lucy.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.\\
131 - Well, but Ricky, a dress shop is just
the thing for you.\\
132 - Look, I already own a dress shop.\\
133 - What do you mean you already own a
dress shop?\\
134 - Have you looked in your closet
lately?\\
135 - Oh, now don't be smart.\\
136 - I don't have a lot of clothes.\\
137 - Huh?\\
138 - All right, so I do have a lot of
clothes,\\
139 - but where did I buy them all?\\
140 - From Hansen's.\\
141 - Me, too. In fact, I bought a dress
there just this morning.\\
142 - So did... lots of people.\\
143 - Ethel, did you buy another dress?\\
144 - Yes, at Hansen's.\\
145 - That's where I've bought all my
dresses\\
146 - ever since we've been married.\\
147 - All three of them.\\
148 - Ethel...\\
149 - Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.\\
150 - Let's not get off the subject.\\
151 - The point is that that dress shop\\
152 - would be a good investment for us.\\
153 - Look, that might be fine and all of
that.\\
154 - The dress shop might be great, but
it's out of the question.\\
155 - Fred and I don't know anything about
running a dress shop.\\
156 - You don't have to run it, Ethel and I
will.\\
157 - Yes!\\
158 - You and Ethel...\\
159 - Yeah.\\
160 - (Fred and Ricky laughing)\\
161 - Oh, no!\\
162 - Well, I don't see what's so funny.\\
163 - Women have good business brains, too.\\
164 - I saved $7 on that dress I bought
this morning.\\
165 - And I saved $10.\\
166 - What did you say?\\
167 - Uh, never mind, just keep on laughing
at us.\\
168 - Ha, ha, ha, ha.\\
169 - "Let's run a business!"\\
170 - Ha, ha, ha, ha.\\
171 - Ha ha?\\
172 - Oh, honestly, Ethel, doesn't it make
you sick\\
173 - that those husbands of ours\\
174 - can't see an opportunity like this?\\
175 - I don't even want to think about it.\\
176 - Honest to goodness, such a darling
shop.\\
177 - Hello, Mrs. Hansen.\\
178 - Oh, Mrs. Ricardo and Mrs. Mertz, how
are you?\\
179 - Hello.
Fine, but Ricky said\\
180 - I had to bring this dress back.\\
181 - Well, that's all right.\\
182 - Well, seeing it was on sale and
everything,\\
183 - won't it foul up your bookkeeping?\\
184 - Oh, not at all, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
185 - You see, I never charge up my sales
to you\\
186 - until at least a week after.\\
187 - Oh.\\
188 - That's nice.\\
189 - We're sure going to miss you\\
190 - when you sell this store.\\
191 - Yeah, we wanted to buy it ourselves,\\
192 - but our husbands wouldn't let us.\\
193 - No. Men have no business sense.\\
194 - No. You know, I'd like to buy it
anyway just to prove\\
195 - that they don't know what they're
talking about.\\
196 - You know, that would be wonderful.\\
197 - And it would practically pay for
itself in no time.\\
198 - Oh, no, no, it's out of the question.\\
199 - It's too much money.\\
200 - You're probably asking thousands of
dollars for it.\\
201 - Now, you'd be surprised how cheap it
is.\\
202 - I have a tremendous stock and a long
lease\\
203 - and all I'm asking is $3,000.\\
204 - $3,000? Is that all?\\
205 - That's all.\\
206 - Uh, you'll excuse me just a moment.\\
207 - Oh, Ethel, I can't stand it.\\
208 - We can't let this opportunity go by.\\
209 - Do you have an idea?\\
210 - Yes, how much money have you got?\\
211 - You always get that same idea.\\
212 - Never mind, how much have you got?\\
213 - It doesn't matter, $3,000 is out of
the question for us.\\
214 - Now, listen, that's just her asking
price.\\
215 - I'll bet I could get her down to
$1,500.\\
216 - I'll bet you couldn't.\\
217 - I'll bet I could.\\
218 - Bet.\\
219 - Now, where were we?\\
220 - Oh, yes, I was telling you the price,
wasn't I?\\
221 - Well, frankly, Mrs. Hansen\\
222 - $3,000, that's just too much money.\\
223 - Uh... I'm sure that was just your
asking price.\\
224 - You'd go a little lower, wouldn't
you?\\
225 - I'm sorry.\\
226 - Just a little bit lower?\\
227 - No.\\
228 - Not a penny?\\
229 - No.\\
230 - Ha, ha, ha!\\
231 - (laughing)\\
232 - What's so funny?\\
233 - I was going to offer you $1,500.\\
234 - $1,500.\\
235 - (all laughing)\\
236 - I'll take it.\\
237 - Uh, just a moment, please.\\
238 - Some customers.
WOMAN: Good afternoon, Mrs. Hansen.\\
239 - Good afternoon.\\
240 - This is that marvelous shop\\
241 - I was telling you about, Grace.\\
242 - Just wait till you see the goodies.\\
243 - Oh, I can hardly wait.\\
244 - Oh, Mrs. Hansen, I'll take that
divine striped dress\\
245 - you put away for me yesterday.\\
246 - Fine.
Just imagine, Grace,\\
247 - 100% pure wool for only $39.50.\\
248 - And look at this cute little sweater.\\
249 - How much is it?\\
250 - $49.50.\\
251 - I'll take it.\\
252 - How much is this sweater?\\
253 - $20.\\
254 - I'll take these two.\\
255 - FIRST WOMAN: I'll take two myself.\\
256 - May I try the dress on?\\
257 - Why, of course, right this way.\\
258 - Come on, Grace.\\
259 - Ethel, do you realize, she just took
in $200?\\
260 - I know.\\
261 - Listen, we've just got to get this
place.\\
262 - This is a gold mine.\\
263 - Oh, but we don't even have the down
payment.\\
264 - Now, look, Mrs. Hansen just made $200
in five minutes.\\
265 - That's $2,400 an hour.\\
266 - The store is open eight hours a
day...\\
267 - Do you realize we'll be making
$19,000 a day?\\
268 - Wow!\\
269 - Mrs. Hansen!\\
270 - Mrs. Hansen, we'll take the store.\\
271 - Oh!\\
272 - All right.\\
273 - If only I had time\\
274 - to hold out for a fair price.\\
275 - Fair!\\
276 - But I cannot stay here.\\
277 - Mother needs me.\\
278 - Your mother!\\
279 - Yes... she's in the hospital\\
280 - and that $1,500 will just about pay
for her operation.\\
281 - Oh, well, Mrs. Hansen,\\
282 - we don't want to take advantage of
you.\\
283 - Oh, well, let's make it $1,750.\\
284 - Oh, bless you.\\
285 - The difference in the money\\
286 - will just about pay the repairs on
the car.\\
287 - The repairs on the car?\\
288 - Yes, grandma had a wreck\\
289 - when she was taking mother to the
hospital.\\
290 - Oh, dear.\\
291 - Oh, Lucy, let's make it 2,000.\\
292 - No, let's make it 2,250.\\
293 - Oh, thank you, thank you!\\
294 - Now, you mustn't think any more about
money.\\
295 - I'll get the house rebuilt somehow.\\
296 - The house!\\
297 - It's a shambles since the fire.\\
298 - Oh, dear, well, look,\\
299 - I-I-I can't have this hanging on my
conscience.\\
300 - Now, look, Mrs. Hansen, you thought
$3,000 was a fair price\\
301 - and that's what we'll pay you.\\
302 - We'll get it back in no time at all.\\
303 - Oh, you're the dearest, sweetest
girls in all the world,\\
304 - and how do you want to handle the
down payment?\\
305 - Uh, well, uh... what did you have in
mind?\\
306 - Money.\\
307 - I mean, I've heard that 10% is usual.\\
308 - 10%... 10%, three...\\
309 - That's $300.\\
310 - Uh, would you, uh, take a check\\
311 - that's postdated a couple of days?\\
312 - Well, I don't know...\\
313 - Well, you see, I have to transfer
some of my...\\
314 - assets in my other accounts.\\
315 - Well, I guess that would be all
right.\\
316 - Good, I'll bring you a check this
afternoon.\\
317 - Partner?\\
318 - Partner.\\
319 - Saks Fifth Avenue, look out!\\
320 - (bell tinkles)\\
321 - I think I'll take this adorable belt,
too.\\
322 - Never mind, they've gone.\\
323 - Oh. Deal set?\\
324 - All set.\\
325 - You were just fine, and you can each
have a scarf\\
326 - for helping me out.\\
327 - Oh, thank you.\\
328 - Oh, hi, I'm sorry I'm late.\\
329 - I had to wait for Ricky to leave\\
330 - before I could take the baby down to
Mrs. Trumbull.\\
331 - How many sales did you make?\\
332 - None.\\
333 - None!\\
334 - We've been open for an hour and a
half.\\
335 - So?\\
336 - So we've already lost $3,600.\\
337 - Oh, Lucy, you can't expect\\
338 - to make $200 every five minutes.\\
339 - Sometimes it'll be more, sometimes
it'll be less.\\
340 - Wait till the rush starts, then we'll
make it up.\\
341 - Yeah, well, I guess you're right.\\
342 - Hey, you know, we ought to call all
our friends\\
343 - and tell them that we bought this
place.\\
344 - Yeah. Say, we're not going\\
345 - to keep on calling it Hansen's, are
we?\\
346 - Oh, no, I guess not.\\
347 - What do you want to call it?\\
348 - Oh, you think of a name.\\
349 - Doesn't make any difference to me.\\
350 - No, it doesn't matter to me either.\\
351 - Well, then, I think it ought to be a
combination\\
352 - of both our names, like "Ethelu's."\\
353 - "Ethelu's"?\\
354 - Well, that doesn't sound very good.\\
355 - Why not?\\
356 - Well, it just doesn't have an easy
flow,\\
357 - a nice, pleasing sound.\\
358 - Well, what would you suggest?\\
359 - Well, something that rolls right off
your tongue\\
360 - like "Lucyeth's."\\
361 - "Lucyeth's?"\\
362 - Well, that rolls right off your
tongue, all right.\\
363 - You couldn't keep it on your tongue
if you tried.\\
364 - Well, maybe we shouldn't try to be
too cute.\\
365 - Just use both our names and that's
all.\\
366 - Okay.\\
367 - Well, it's settled, then:\\
368 - "Lucy and Ethel's Dress Shop."\\
369 - "Lucy and Ethel's Dress Shop"?\\
370 - Yeah.\\
371 - Well, I think there ought to be a
slight change.\\
372 - What kind of a change?\\
373 - Well, like "Ethel and Lucy's Dress
Shop."\\
374 - Why would you make a change like
that?\\
375 - Well, just because I think "Ethel and
Lucy's Dress Shop"\\
376 - sounds better to the ear.\\
377 - Not to my ear it doesn't.\\
378 - Well, you've got a tin ear.\\
379 - Well, you're a big ham.\\
380 - Who's a big ham?\\
381 - You are, you've always got to have
your name first.\\
382 - You're the one...
Ethel, Lucy, Ethel, Lucy,\\
383 - (bell tinkles)\\
384 - This is a pretty pickle.\\
385 - We've been open two whole days\\
386 - and haven't seen a customer.\\
387 - We've made five sales.\\
388 - Yes, to each other.\\
389 - And I think we should have
investigated our credit\\
390 - before we opened those charge
accounts.\\
391 - Hey, there's Ricky and Fred.\\
392 - Look.
Where? Oh!\\
393 - RICKY: I just don't get it.\\
394 - Oh, isn't that a really darling...\\
395 - Oh, hi!
Oh, hi.\\
396 - Don't worry, we didn't buy anything.\\
397 - We're on our way home from the
drugstore.\\
398 - Do you want to go home with us?\\
399 - No, we got to do a little more
shopping.\\
400 - All right, see you later.\\
401 - Okay.
Bye, honey.\\
402 - You know, I don't understand it.\\
403 - How can a guy be flat on his back
three times\\
404 - and still get up and win?\\
405 - FRED: Maybe he had a sore back.\\
406 - Where is everybody?\\
407 - I don't know.\\
408 - Maybe the whole town's been
evacuated,\\
409 - and they forgot to tell us.\\
410 - What time is it, anyway?\\
411 - It's 3:00.\\
412 - Here comes somebody-- pretend you're
a customer.\\
413 - (bell tinkles)\\
414 - LUCY: Now, this is a lovely dress.\\
415 - Oh, that's just darling.\\
416 - Does it come in any other colors?\\
417 - Well, uh...\\
418 - Oh, never mind, Ethel, it's Mrs.
Hansen.\\
419 - Hello, Mrs. Hansen.\\
420 - Mrs. Ricardo, your check bounced.\\
421 - My check bounced!\\
422 - Like a rubber ball.\\
423 - Well! I'll call that bank\\
424 - and give them a piece of my mind.\\
425 - I've already called them.\\
426 - Oh, you have?\\
427 - Uh, look, Mrs. Hansen, now, you know
who my husband is.\\
428 - Now, there's no question about that
check being good.\\
429 - Then you won't mind if I call and ask
him.\\
430 - Uh, no, go right ahead.\\
431 - Oh, but you won't be able to use our
phone--\\
432 - it's out of order, isn't it, Ethel?\\
433 - Huh? Oh, yes, it's out of order.\\
434 - Hello, hello?\\
435 - Dead as a doornail.\\
436 - I'll call him from the drugstore.\\
437 - Oh, Lucy, what are you going to do?\\
438 - Get my coat and purse.\\
439 - (phone rings)\\
440 - Hello?\\
441 - Hello, Ricky?\\
442 - Ricky, this is Lucy.\\
443 - How are you, dear?\\
444 - Fine. Where are you?\\
445 - I'm downtown.\\
446 - Uh... oh, listen, honey,\\
447 - hang on a minute-- don't hang up.\\
448 - Where are you going?\\
449 - I'm going home.
Home?\\
450 - Yeah, and don't hang up this phone
for five minutes.\\
451 - Hi, dear.\\
452 - What kept you so long?\\
453 - Well, I got here as soon as I could.\\
454 - Well, what do you want?\\
455 - Well, hang up and I'll tell you.\\
456 - Okay, good-bye.\\
457 - What are you doing?\\
458 - Uh... well, I was so close\\
459 - I thought I might as well come on
home.\\
460 - Oh... well, what do you want, honey?\\
461 - Uh, well, I...
I was worrying\\
462 - about Little Ricky-- how is he?\\
463 - He's fine.
He's been fine all day.\\
464 - (phone rings)\\
465 - Uh, are you sure?\\
466 - I think I hear him crying.\\
467 - I don't hear anything.\\
468 - Oh, you'd better go see, dear.\\
469 - All right, I'll go see.\\
470 - Hello, Ricardos' residence, this is
the maid speaking.\\
471 - Mr. Ricardo? Yes, he's here, but he
doesn't speak any English.\\
472 - You don't speak Spanish, do you?\\
473 - Oh, you do.\\
474 - Oh, well, just a moment.\\
475 - He's fine, honey, he wasn't crying.\\
476 - Is the call for me?\\
477 - Uh... yeah.\\
478 - Yeah, it's one of my girlfriends\\
479 - and she's trying to help her daughter\\
480 - with some Spanish for school,\\
481 - and she thought maybe you could help
her out.\\
482 - Sure, what does she want to know how
to say?\\
483 - Uh...\\
484 - "The check is good."\\
485 - "The check is good"?\\
486 - Uh-huh.\\
487 - That's a funny thing for a kid to
know how to say.\\
488 - Well, it's probably one of those
sentences\\
489 - that they have to write out--\\
490 - you know, like "Do you have an
umbrella?"\\
491 - "Do you have a match?"\\
492 - "The check is good."\\
493 - Oh.\\
494 - You know, like that.\\
495 - "The check is good."\\
496 - "El cheque esta bueno."\\
497 - Thank you.\\
498 - That's all you wanted to know, wasn't
it?\\
499 - Thank you, good-bye.\\
500 - Esta bueno cheque.\\
501 - No, no, no, el cheque esta bueno.\\
502 - Esta... esta check e beno, bueno.\\
503 - El cheque esta bueno.\\
504 - Esta bueno, esta bueno.\\
505 - El cheque esta bueno...\\
506 - Yeah, that's a very cute way of
saying it.\\
507 - Oh, boy, I got out of that one.\\
508 - Lucy, while you were gone\\
509 - a man called up-- a Mr. Ralph S.
Boyer.\\
510 - What did he want?\\
511 - Did he want to buy something?\\
512 - Yes.
What, a dress?\\
513 - No, he's interested in buying the
store.\\
514 - Buying the store!\\
515 - Yes, he's on his way over here now.\\
516 - Oh, wonderful.\\
517 - We'll use the same gag on him that
Mrs. Hansen used on us.\\
518 - You know, about her grandmother\\
519 - that's been in a terrible accident.\\
520 - Only this time we won't just talk
about the grandmother.\\
521 - What do you mean?\\
522 - You just stall him off.\\
523 - I'll be back as soon as I can.\\
524 - (humming loudly)\\
525 - (humming frantically)\\
526 - Here, wait a minute, Grandma,\\
527 - let me help you.\\
528 - I'm going that way.
I'm going down there.\\
529 - Oh, you're going this way.\\
530 - You must have had a...\\
531 - you must have had a a terrible
accident.\\
532 - Oh, it was awful.
Yes, it was a terrible thing.\\
533 - I got all smashed up.
Somebody came at me from behind.\\
534 - I'm going right here.
This is where I'm going.\\
535 - Well, this shop is closed.\\
536 - How's that?\\
537 - This shop is closed.\\
538 - Closed?
There's a note on the door here.\\
539 - What does it say?\\
540 - It says, "Lucy, I've gone to Mr.
Boyer's bank with him\\
541 - to close the deal-- Ethel."\\
542 - Oh, for heaven's sake, what's the
matter with her?\\
543 - Is she crazy or something?\\
544 - She doesn't know how to take care of
a deal.\\
545 - Oh, I could kill her.\\
546 - She can't add two and two.\\
547 - What does she know about making
deals?\\
548 - For heaven's sakes, oh...\\
549 - Ethel!\\
550 - Lucy!\\
551 - Come here and help me get this off.\\
552 - Help you get...
Oh, all right.\\
553 - Now, where have you been?\\
554 - Lucy, you've got to come down to the
bank\\
555 - and sign the papers.\\
556 - I'm not going anyplace till I find
out what this is all about.\\
557 - He gave us $3,500.\\
558 - I don't...\\
559 - $3,500!\\
560 - Yippee!\\
561 - Oh, this is wonderful!\\
562 - That's $500 for us.\\
563 - Oh, and our husbands think\\
564 - we don't know anything about
business.\\
565 - Oh, be my guest, I'll drive you to
the bank.\\
566 - Okay.\\
567 - (Lucy singing gleefully)\\
568 - And that's for you, and that's for
me.\\
569 - That's 250 for you and 250 for me.\\
570 - I'm just going to wave it at them
when they come in.\\
571 - Oh, I can't wait to see their faces\\
572 - when we show it to them.\\
573 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!\\
574 - What a deal this could have been.\\
575 - Yeah, two prize idiots.\\
576 - Okay, Rick, you kick me\\
577 - and then I'll kick you.\\
578 - What are you talking about?\\
579 - What's the matter?\\
580 - Well, you know that dress shop that
you wanted us to buy?\\
581 - Yeah?\\
582 - Somebody just bought it in a deal.\\
583 - How did you know about it?\\
584 - RICKY: Right here in the papers.\\
585 - In the papers? Really?\\
586 - You know, it seems that they wanted\\
587 - to build a skyscraper in that block,\\
588 - and the only thing that was holding
the deal up\\
589 - was the lease on that shop.\\
590 - So a fellow by the name of Boyer
bought it\\
591 - and sold it to the construction
company\\
592 - for $50,000.\\

1 - (I Love Lucy theme music plays)\\
2 - (all cooing)\\
3 - Bye-bye.\\
4 - Say bye-bye.\\
5 - Say bye-bye.\\
6 - ALL: Bye.\\
7 - He's going to take his nap.\\
8 - Bye.\\
9 - Bye-bye.\\
10 - Isn't he just growing?\\
11 - I tell you, he's the image of his
father.\\
12 - He's my godson, you know.\\
13 - Just darling...\\
14 - (cooing continues)\\
15 - Well, let's get on with the meeting.\\
16 - We have to wait for Lucy?\\
17 - Well, she's the president.\\
18 - Well, I'm the co-president.\\
19 - I'll take over even though it isn't
my turn.\\
20 - Then we won't waste any time, huh?\\
21 - Yeah.\\
22 - All right.\\
23 - (all talking)\\
24 - Well, did I miss anything?\\
25 - Next thing on the agenda is...\\
26 - Uh, I'll take over now, Ethel.\\
27 - It's my turn to be president.\\
28 - ETHEL: Hey, that's doing pretty good,
isn't it?\\
29 - That's great.\\
30 - (Lucy taps gavel)\\
31 - Girls, girls.\\
32 - The meeting will come to order.\\
33 - Now, I would like to talk about the
club's yearly show.\\
34 - I think we should schedule it for
sometime next week.\\
35 - Next week?\\
36 - But it's so close to the bazaar.\\
37 - But it's only three months\\
38 - since we had our last yearly show.\\
39 - Yes, I know.
Now, if you'll all be quiet\\
40 - I'll have Caroline tell you\\
41 - the wonderful reason-- Caroline?\\
42 - and last night we were talking, and
he just happened to mention\\
43 - that there was one half hour of time\\
44 - that they hadn't been able to sell.\\
45 - So I said to him,\\
46 - "Charlie, how about letting our
women's club put on a show\\
47 - during that half hour?"\\
48 - And he said... well, never mind what
he said.\\
49 - Well, anyway, after I talked to him
for a while,\\
50 - he finally agreed that our club can
have the time.\\
51 - (all exclaiming excitedly)\\
52 - (tapping gavel)\\
53 - Girls, girls, girls, let's be
businesslike about this now.\\
54 - What time did he agree to give us,
Caroline?\\
55 - Uh, next Monday from 12:00 to 12:30.\\
56 - Oh, that's fine time.\\
57 - That's right in the middle of the day\\
58 - when everybody's home.\\
59 - Yeah, well, everybody's home, all
right,\\
60 - but it's not the middle of the day.\\
61 - It's 12:00 midnight.\\
62 - Midnight!\\
63 - Oh, well, now, look-- what difference
does it make?\\
64 - We have a whole half hour on
television.\\
65 - Now, the important thing is to select
the chairman,\\
66 - someone to be in charge of the whole
program.\\
67 - Now, it's very important that we
select someone\\
68 - who has a lot of talent, who makes a
good appearance,\\
69 - someone who is in show business or at
least close to it\\
70 - by having a husband, or someone like
that, you know,\\
71 - who is in it.\\
72 - You all agree with me, don't you?\\
73 - (all talking at once)\\
74 - Well, then the chair will have
nominations\\
75 - for that important post.\\
76 - The chair recognizes Marian Strong.\\
77 - You're absolutely right, Madam
Chairman.\\
78 - That's just the kind of a person we
need.\\
79 - Well, it's the only logical way.\\
80 - Now, as you all know, there is only
one of us here\\
81 - who is really close to the theater.\\
82 - I spent a number of years as an
actress...\\
83 - brilliantly climaxing my career\\
84 - by being mistress of ceremonies at
the Senior Shenanigans\\
85 - of the Rappahannock School For Girls.\\
86 - Need I say more?\\
87 - Well, you certainly need not.\\
88 - I didn't know you were professional.\\
89 - (all talking excitedly)\\
90 - Madam Co-President,\\
91 - uh, at this point, may I ask you to
take over?\\
92 - Why?\\
93 - Well, it's not fair for me\\
94 - to be president at this moment.\\
95 - For what I have to say, I'd rather be
a civilian.\\
96 - Now, do I hear any more nominations\\
97 - for chairman of our show?\\
98 - Lucy Ricardo.\\
99 - Well, uh, dramatic experience is
fine,\\
100 - but will the general public know\\
101 - who Marian Strong is?\\
102 - Well, you can tell them\\
103 - at the beginning of the program, you
know.\\
104 - The program would be over before we
could say\\
105 - "Senior Shenanigans of the
Rappahannock School For Girls."\\
106 - It would not!
Oh, girls.\\
107 - Oh, it certainly would.\\
108 - Girls!\\
109 - You can't say...\\
110 - Girls!\\
111 - ..."school for girls"\\
112 - without your tongue getting twisted.\\
113 - Lucy... Lucy, you have the floor.\\
114 - Thank you very much.\\
115 - Therefore, I think\\
116 - that I should be the chairman.\\
117 - Who knows who you are?\\
118 - Nobody, and you hit it right on the
head.\\
119 - What we need is a star name, and if I
am chosen chairman\\
120 - I will guarantee to get Ricky Ricardo\\
121 - as master of ceremonies.\\
122 - Oh, Lucy, are you sure you could get
Ricky?\\
123 - Oh, well, girls, girls,\\
124 - in that case,\\
125 - I'm sure that Marian will be\\
126 - the first to agree\\
127 - that Lucy should be in charge.\\
128 - Of course.\\
129 - Now, all those in favor of making
Lucy Ricardo chairman\\
130 - of our yearly show on television, say
"aye."\\
131 - SEVERAL VOICES: Aye.\\
132 - The "ayes" have it.\\
133 - Meeting adjourned, let's eat.\\
134 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
135 - Ethel, will you help me?\\
136 - (all chatting)\\
137 - Don't forget the punchbowl.\\
138 - Oh, Lucy, imagine us being on
television.\\
139 - Isn't it wonderful?\\
140 - Oh, boy.\\
141 - And with Ricky as master of
ceremonies.\\
142 - Good night.\\
143 - Hey, what made him change his mind?\\
144 - I thought he said he never would be\\
145 - in another women's club production.\\
146 - He did.\\
147 - Well, then, how come he agreed to be
in this one?\\
148 - He didn't yet.\\
149 - Oh, Lucy, you just said you could get
Ricky\\
150 - so you'd get to be the chairman.\\
151 - Oh, what a sneaky thing to do.\\
152 - If I am the chairman\\
153 - the best parts in the show\\
154 - are certain to go to you and me.\\
155 - Oh, yeah.\\
156 - Doesn't seem so sneaky now, does it?\\
157 - Well...\\
158 - (knock)\\
159 - Come in.\\
160 - Hi.
Hi, Fred.\\
161 - Hi.
Hi, Fred.\\
162 - Is this week's meeting\\
163 - of the claw and cackle club over?\\
164 - Never mind that now, Fred.\\
165 - We're going to be on television.\\
166 - Who is?\\
167 - Our women's club.\\
168 - Well, That ought to bring back
movies.\\
169 - No kidding, Fred.\\
170 - Caroline Appleby's husband said\\
171 - that we could have a whole half hour\\
172 - on his TV station next Monday night.\\
173 - Oh, do you need any good talent?\\
174 - What kind of a show are you going to
put on?\\
175 - Uh...\\
176 - A cooking show.
A panel show.\\
177 - Oh, I get it.\\
178 - Well, if you don't want me on your
show, I won't be in it.\\
179 - Okay.
Okay.\\
180 - On the other hand,\\
181 - you're entitled to a...\\
182 - to a little peek at the kind of
talent you're turning down.\\
183 - Now, listen, Fred, Ricky's going to
be the only man in it.\\
184 - All the rest are members of our
women's club.\\
185 - When the red, red robin comes a-bob
bob bobbin' along, along\\
186 - We should know better than to tell
him.\\
187 - There'll be no more sobbin'\\
188 - When he starts robbin' his own sweet
song\\
189 - Wake up, wake up, wake up, you sleepy
head\\
190 - Okay, Fred.
All right, Fred.\\
191 - Get up, come on, come on, get out of
bed\\
192 - Cheer up, cheer up...\\
193 - Okay, you can be in it.\\
194 - Cheer up, the sun is red\\
195 - Fred, she said you can be in it.\\
196 - Live, love, laugh and be happy\\
197 - What if I were blue\\
198 - I'll be walking through a field of
flowers\\
199 - The rain will glisten, and I will
listen\\
200 - BOTH: For hours and hours.\\
201 - Oh, I'm just a kid again, doing what
I did again\\
202 - Singing a song\\
203 - When the red, red robin...\\
204 - FRED: When the red, red robin\\
205 - Comes bob, bob, bobbin' along...\\
206 - He's still at it.\\
207 - Come on, Ethel.\\
208 - Let's figure out the routine for the
show.\\
209 - Okay.\\
210 - What'll we start with?\\
211 - Well, Luann Hall\\
212 - will want to play the piano.\\
213 - Yeah.\\
214 - And Jane Sebastian will want to do
her birdcalls.\\
215 - Yeah.\\
216 - She's all right.\\
217 - I suppose Caroline will want to do\\
218 - her impersonation of Bette Davis.\\
219 - That isn't Bette Davis she
impersonates.\\
220 - It's Lionel Barrymore.\\
221 - It is?\\
222 - Say...\\
223 - you don't think we could get along
without Caroline, do you?\\
224 - Her husband manages the station.\\
225 - Who follows Caroline?\\
226 - Rosalyn McKee will want to recite
"Trees."\\
227 - Oh, she does that so beautifully.\\
228 - Yeah, she does, she really does.\\
229 - Let's see now, Ricky can sing a
couple of numbers\\
230 - and then I'll do\\
231 - the big closing number\\
232 - and that's it.\\
233 - I don't think I've left out anyone,
have I?\\
234 - Can you think of anyone el...?\\
235 - Oh, dear.\\
236 - Well, thank you.\\
237 - Oh, well, come now, dear.\\
238 - We'll find a spot for you someplace.\\
239 - Let's see here, Luann, Jane,
Caroline.\\
240 - Well, you can't do the closing
number.\\
241 - Why?\\
242 - 'Cause I'm doing it.\\
243 - Why?\\
244 - Well, I'm the president.\\
245 - Well, I'm the co-president.\\
246 - Well, I'm the chairman.\\
247 - Well, I'm the one who knows how you
got to be chairman.\\
248 - Well!\\
249 - Oh, come on, now, Lucy,\\
250 - seeing as we're co-presidents,\\
251 - why don't we do a duet?\\
252 - A duet?\\
253 - Yeah, something like, uh...\\
254 - that Cole Porter song, "Friendship."\\
255 - Isn't that a wonderful idea?\\
256 - Well, no.\\
257 - That way I don't get to sing alone.\\
258 - That's what makes it a wonderful
idea.\\
259 - Now, cut it out, Ethel.\\
260 - "Friendship"?\\
261 - Uh-huh.\\
262 - "Friendship," let's see,\\
263 - is that the one that goes...
(hums)\\
264 - (off-key): If you're ever up a tree\\
265 - Call on me.\\
266 - That's it.\\
267 - Is that it?\\
268 - Yeah, that's a wonderful number.\\
269 - Listen, let's get some sheet music\\
270 - and rehearse it.
Okay.\\
271 - Here, help me move this table.\\
272 - Where are you gonna put it?\\
273 - Play with your toys, honey.\\
274 - ETHEL: Lucy?\\
275 - Yeah, I'm here, Ethel.\\
276 - Hi, honey.\\
277 - Ricky isn't home yet, huh?\\
278 - No, not yet.\\
279 - Lucy, I've been worrying.
About what?\\
280 - Well, what if you can't talk him into\\
281 - emceeing the show?\\
282 - Don't worry, I've got my strategy all
planned.\\
283 - What are you going to do, wheedle
him?\\
284 - No, I've done that so much\\
285 - my wheedle is all worn out.\\
286 - And I'm not going to be lovey dovey\\
287 - or cry or pout either.\\
288 - What's left?\\
289 - I'm going to use my head.\\
290 - What are you going to do, beat him
with it?\\
291 - No, I'm going to make Ricky ask\\
292 - to be in that show.\\
293 - How? Hypnotize him?\\
294 - No, when Ricky comes home,\\
295 - you and I are going to be talking
about the show,\\
296 - and we'll be discussing who we're
going to get to emcee.\\
297 - You watch, Ricky won't be able to
stand it.\\
298 - We won't even mention him.\\
299 - Oh, I don't know.\\
300 - Well, I do.\\
301 - Listen, Ethel, next to sugar,\\
302 - Cuba's biggest export is ham.\\
303 - RICKY: Honey, I'm home.\\
304 - There it is.\\
305 - Okay, dear, I'll be right there.\\
306 - Now, Ethel, you remember, you follow
my lead.\\
307 - We won't even mention Ricky.\\
308 - We'll consider everyone but him.\\
309 - Okay.\\
310 - Hi, dear.\\
311 - Hi. Oh, hi, Ethel.\\
312 - Hello, Ricky.\\
313 - Hi, honey.
Hi, honey.\\
314 - Guess what happened at the club
meeting today.\\
315 - I know I shouldn't ask, but what?\\
316 - Well, Caroline Appleby's husband\\
317 - said that we could have one whole
half hour\\
318 - on his TV station next Monday night.\\
319 - We're going to put on a review.\\
320 - Yes?\\
321 - And we were waiting for you to come
home\\
322 - because we wanted to ask you\\
323 - a very important question.\\
324 - Yes...?\\
325 - Should we wear formals?\\
326 - Should you wear formals?\\
327 - Yeah, Ethel and I have got a number
to do together,\\
328 - and we don't know whether to wear
costumes or formals.\\
329 - Oh, let's wear formals.\\
330 - It'll give me an excuse to buy a new
one.\\
331 - Okay. Formals it is.\\
332 - Thanks anyway, Ricky.\\
333 - Didn't need you after all.\\
334 - Come on, Ethel.\\
335 - Oh, say, wait a minute: what about
the emcee?\\
336 - Yeah, what about the emcee?\\
337 - Yeah, what about the emcee?\\
338 - Well, you see, we need a master of
ceremonies\\
339 - and it'd be great if it was someone
really wonderful, you know.\\
340 - Gee, I can't think of a soul.\\
341 - Can you think of anybody, Ethel?\\
342 - Well, it'll be a great opportunity\\
343 - for someone to be seen on television.\\
344 - Sure will.\\
345 - He'll be in front of the cameras\\
346 - most of the time.\\
347 - That's right.\\
348 - Should be someone who makes a good
appearance.\\
349 - A dark, handsome type.\\
350 - It'd be great if he could play\\
351 - a musical instrument and sing a song.\\
352 - Yeah.\\
353 - Let's see now, a dark, handsome type,\\
354 - plays a musical instrument and sings
a song.\\
355 - Well, there's only one person to ask.\\
356 - Dan Jenkins.\\
357 - Dan Jenkins?\\
358 - Yeah, what's the matter with him?\\
359 - Well, it's none of my business,\\
360 - but this fella doesn't even have a
voice.\\
361 - Well, he plays a musical instrument.\\
362 - Sure, tissue paper and comb.\\
363 - Well, if that's what you want, it's
okay with me.\\
364 - Oh, well, honey, it isn't what we
want.\\
365 - We don't want Dan Jenkins.\\
366 - But, uh, you know\\
367 - we'd like to have somebody like,
uh...\\
368 - Well, somebody great\\
369 - but we don't know anybody like that,\\
370 - so what are we going to do?\\
371 - Well, uh...
you haven't asked me.\\
372 - You? Why, you said you'd never be\\
373 - in another one of our shows.\\
374 - Oh, I don't know.\\
375 - I might be available if I was
approached correctly.\\
376 - Oh, honey, now don't kid us about
this.\\
377 - This is serious.\\
378 - You're being mean.\\
379 - No, I'm not.
I'm not kidding.\\
380 - I'm serious.
I'll do it.\\
381 - Really? What made you change your
mind?\\
382 - I don't know, I just feel like it.\\
383 - And that should teach you a lesson.\\
384 - What should?\\
385 - Well, you know, I can always tell\\
386 - when you're trying to make me do
something,\\
387 - when you, you know, when you trick me
into it.\\
388 - Oh?
And I'll never do it\\
389 - when you're trying to make me do it.\\
390 - No.\\
391 - But this is different, as you know.\\
392 - Here you were in a spot,\\
393 - and, uh... you respected my wishes\\
394 - about not being in the show.\\
395 - You didn't even ask.\\
396 - No.\\
397 - So I'm going to be big about it and
I'll help you out.\\
398 - Oh, honey, you're wonderful.\\
399 - Oh, that's so sweet.\\
400 - Now you see how much farther you get
by just being honest?\\
401 - Yes, dear, I've learned my lesson.\\
402 - That's a good girl.\\
403 - Ricky, we've been rehearsing our
number\\
404 - and we want to do it with a piano.\\
405 - Will you play for us?\\
406 - Sure.\\
407 - Well, I've got to have a ringside
seat for this.\\
408 - Honey, help me move this down there.\\
409 - All right.\\
410 - Push it up toward the couch.\\
411 - Okay.
Now you stand over there\\
412 - and we'll make an entrance like this.\\
413 - Right there?
Yeah.\\
414 - Ricky, give us a-one, a-two.\\
415 - Are you ready?\\
416 - Uh-huh.\\
417 - All right.\\
418 - One, two.\\
419 - (Ricky begins playing piano)\\
420 - If you're ever in a jam, here I am.\\
421 - If you're ever in a mess, S.O.S.\\
422 - If you ever get so happy, you land in
jail\\
423 - I'm your bail.\\
424 - BOTH: It's friendship, friendship,
just the perfect blendship.\\
425 - When other friendships have been

426 - Ours will still be hot.\\
427 - A da-da-da-da da-da dig-dig-dig\\
428 - A da-da-da-da da-da dig-dig-dig\\
429 - Isn't that funny?\\
430 - If you're ever up a tree\\
431 - A-phone to me.\\
432 - If you're ever down a well\\
433 - Ring my bell.\\
434 - Okay.\\
435 - If you ever lose your dough\\
436 - When you're out to dine, borrow mine.\\
437 - BOTH: It's friendship, friendship,
just the perfect blendship.\\
438 - When other friendships have been
forgate\\
439 - Ours will still be great.\\
440 - A la-da-la-da la-da chuck-chuck-chuck\\
441 - A la-da-la-da la-da
chuck-chuck-chuck.\\
442 - If they ever a-black your eye\\
443 - A-put me wise.\\
444 - If they ever cook your goose\\
445 - Turn me loose.\\
446 - If they ever put a bullet\\
447 - Right through your brain, I'll
complain.\\
448 - BOTH: It's friendship, friendship,
just the perfect blendship.\\
449 - When other friendships have been
forgit\\
450 - Ours will still be it\\
451 - A la-da-la-da la-da hep-hep-hep\\
452 - Two, three.\\
453 - A da-da-da-da da-da hep-hep-hep\\
454 - Two, three.\\
455 - A da-da-da-da da-da hep-hep-hep!\\
456 - Ooh.\\
457 - Did you like it?\\
458 - Well, it's a little bit on the corny
side,\\
459 - but I think it'll go, yeah.\\
460 - What'd you think, Fred?\\
461 - Well, it may even be worth\\
462 - all the money you spent on your new
dress.\\
463 - Oh, Ethel, you didn't tell me.\\
464 - When did you get it?\\
465 - Yesterday afternoon.\\
466 - I got mine today.\\
467 - Go get yours and I'll show you mine.\\
468 - Okay.\\
469 - (laughs)\\
470 - Oh, what a pair, eh?\\
471 - La-la la-la la-la la-la\\
472 - BOTH: Hep-hep-hep.\\
473 - Oh, they're demons all right.\\
474 - I want you to see this.\\
475 - I think this is the most beautiful
dress...\\
476 - I never thought I'd own a dress like
this in my whole life.\\
477 - When I saw it there, I just couldn't
stand it.\\
478 - And I had such a wonderful
opportunity to buy it and everything.\\
479 - I can only hope I'm looking in a
mirror.\\
480 - Well, I'm sorry to say you're not.\\
481 - Where did you get yours?\\
482 - At Macy's.\\
483 - Where did you get yours?\\
484 - Gimbel's.\\
485 - Imagine us getting the same dress\\
486 - at two different stores.\\
487 - Yeah, it sure is a funny coincidence.\\
488 - Sure is.\\
489 - Well, it's very amusing,\\
490 - but what are we going to do about it?\\
491 - Oh, well, there's only one thing to
do.\\
492 - One of us will have to take her dress
back.\\
493 - Yeah, one of us will have to.\\
494 - Why take either one of them back?\\
495 - Yeah, I think it's kind of cute.\\
496 - You know you can do like a sister
act.
Yeah.\\
497 - Oh, for heaven's sake,\\
498 - you don't think we're going to go out
there\\
499 - and do that number in the same dress,
do you?\\
500 - Good grief, no.\\
501 - Well, I'll make the sacrifice, Ethel.\\
502 - I'll take mine back and get something
else.\\
503 - Oh, no, I'll take mine back.\\
504 - No, it's all right, Ethel.\\
505 - I'll take mine back.\\
506 - Oh, I couldn't let you do that,
honey.\\
507 - I'll take mine back.\\
508 - Well, somebody take something back.\\
509 - Look, if it's going to create some
hard feelings,\\
510 - why don't you both take them back?
Yeah.\\
511 - Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.\\
512 - Okay, I'll go for that.\\
513 - Yeah, we'll both take them back.\\
514 - All right.\\
515 - Yeah.\\
516 - Honey, I'll meet you down at the
television studio.\\
517 - LUCY: Oh, no, now, wait for me,
honey.\\
518 - I'm going with you.\\
519 - Now, you just wait.\\
520 - Lucy, isn't that the...\\
521 - Yes, it is.\\
522 - I got to thinking it was silly\\
523 - for both of us to take our dresses
back.\\
524 - As long as Ethel was taking hers
back,\\
525 - there was no reason for me to take
mine back.\\
526 - Well, there isn't.\\
527 - I didn't say a word.\\
528 - I'll go and get Mrs. Trumbull\\
529 - to stay with Little Ricky.\\
530 - Ricky?\\
531 - What?\\
532 - Do you think Ethel will be mad at me?\\
533 - I wouldn't be surprised\\
534 - if she punched you right in the nose.\\
535 - Why do you say that?\\
536 - It's perfectly logical.\\
537 - Well, if she was going to take her
dress back,\\
538 - there's no reason why I have to take
mine back.\\
539 - Oh, for pete's sake, Ethel, aren't
you ready yet?\\
540 - ETHEL: I'm coming, I'm coming.\\
541 - Why, Ethel Louise Mertz.\\
542 - Well, there wasn't any sense\\
543 - in both of us taking our dresses
back.\\
544 - If she was going to take her dress
back,\\
545 - I couldn't see any reason for me to
take my dress back.\\
546 - Well, one of us should have it.\\
547 - It's such a pretty dress.\\
548 - Come on, they're going to meet us
down there.\\
549 - I'm not going to let her see me till
we do the number.\\
550 - All right, all right.\\
551 - RICKY: Now if I may, I'd like to do a
little number for you.\\
552 - It's become quite popular in the last
couple of months.\\
553 - Se llego el momento ya de separarnos\\
554 - En silencio el corazon dice y
suspira...\\
555 - Vaya con dios, mi vida\\
556 - Vaya con dios, mi amor.\\
557 - Las campanas de la iglesia suenan
tristes\\
558 - Y parece que al sonar tambien te
dicen\\
559 - Vaya con dios, mi vida\\
560 - Vaya con dios, mi amor.\\
561 - Adonde vayas tu ire contigo\\
562 - En sueno siempre junto a ti estare\\
563 - Mi voz escucharas, dulce amor mio\\
564 - Y como yo estaras tambien a de
volver.\\
565 - La alborada al despertar feliz te
espera\\
566 - Si en mi corazon yo voy adonde quiera\\
567 - Vaya con dios, mi vida\\
568 - Vaya con dios, mi amor.\\
569 - (applause)\\

you, gentlemen.\\

\subsection {Episode 04: Equal Rights}
1 - (I Love Lucy theme music plays)\\
2 - Those things were always happening to
us.\\
3 - Oh, you characters.\\
4 - So anyhow, we went down to Miami\\
5 - and asked the real estate man\\
6 - to show us our lot.\\
7 - He pointed out in the bay\\
8 - and he said, "You see that row boat?\\
9 - It's anchored on your lot."\\
10 - (laughs)\\
11 - We thought we were going to be
millionaires.\\
12 - Ah, here's Lucy.\\
13 - Well, it's about time.\\
14 - Let's go.\\
15 - Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not ready yet.\\
16 - Well, honey, Mrs. Trumbull is with
Little Ricky.\\
17 - Let's go.
Honey, it'll only be a minute.\\
18 - My nails aren't dry.\\
19 - But I'm hungry.\\
20 - Come on now, sit down.\\
21 - Tell another story, Fred.\\
22 - Oh, well, all right.\\
23 - Rick, did I ever tell you\\
24 - what happened to Ethel and me on our
honeymoon?\\
25 - Not lately.\\
26 - Oh!\\
27 - Did I tell you, Lucy?\\
28 - Yes.\\
29 - I was there.\\
30 - Oh, I forgot.\\
31 - Hey, you know, speaking of funny
things that happen to people,\\
32 - Lucy, you remember the musicians'
picnic last Fourth of July?\\
33 - Oh, what a day that was.\\
34 - What happened?\\
35 - Oh, well...\\
36 - I'll tell it, dear.\\
37 - Oh, okay.\\
38 - The, uh, the musicians' local was
having a picnic, see...\\
39 - it was for charity.
You know, you paid so much money\\
40 - and half of it went for charity\\
41 - and half of it went for the picnic.\\
42 - wanted to go,\\
43 - so Marco and Alberto and Pepin\\
44 - and Joe and Ralph--\\
45 - everybody was going down there.\\
46 - So we left about 10:00...\\
47 - It was 12:00.\\
48 - No, dear, it was 10:00.\\
49 - No, honey, it was 12:00.\\
50 - Well, what's the difference?\\
51 - Two hours.\\
52 - I mean to the story.\\
53 - It doesn't make any difference.\\
54 - Yes, it does, dear.\\
55 - That's the reason we were late.\\
56 - That's why...\\
57 - Well, it's your story, go ahead.\\
58 - Thank you.\\
59 - Well, we got to the picnic grounds...\\
60 - Don't forget about the cars.\\
61 - What was that?\\
62 - I said don't forget about the cars,
dear.\\
63 - Oh, the cars.
Yeah, that's right.\\
64 - We took three cars.\\
65 - Lucy and I were in the first car,\\
66 - Pepin was in the second car\\
67 - and Marco was in the last car.\\
68 - Oh, honey, you're ruining everything.\\
69 - Would you like to tell the story?\\
70 - No, dear, you're the storyteller in
the family,\\
71 - but I just want you to get it right.\\
72 - Now, Pepin was in the first car,\\
73 - Marco was in the second and we were
in the last.\\
74 - Maybe Pepin was in the first car,\\
75 - and you were in the second\\
76 - and Marco was in the third.\\
77 - Fred.\\
78 - Well, it was the only combination
left.\\
79 - Okay, I take it all back.\\
80 - We all took the same bus.\\
81 - Coward.\\
82 - Anyway...\\
83 - we got to the picnic grounds about
2:00.\\
84 - Don't look at me.\\
85 - I'm not going to say anything more.\\
86 - Good.\\
87 - I'm not going to tell you what you
left out.\\
88 - Anyway, we got to the picnic grounds
about...\\
89 - um... what did I leave out?\\
90 - Nothing, go on with the story.\\
91 - Well, it feels like there's something\\
92 - missing there someplace.\\
93 - You sure?\\
94 - Positive.\\
95 - All right, well, we spread the food
out\\
96 - and it started to rain.\\
97 - Oh, it poured.\\
98 - So we took everything and we ran to
the cars\\
99 - and then when we got there...\\
100 - Yeah, yeah, what happened?\\
101 - What's the matter, Ricky?\\
102 - What did I leave out?\\
103 - Nothing, I was just kidding you.\\
104 - Now go on.\\
105 - Well, I'm telling you, it feels like
there's\\
106 - something missing there someplace.\\
107 - Oh, what's the difference?\\
108 - Go on and finish it.\\
109 - Well...\\
110 - Oh, the heck with it.\\
111 - It's not funny anymore.\\
112 - Come on, let's go and have dinner.\\
113 - Well, all right.
My nails are dry now.\\
114 - Let's go to that place on 45th
Street.\\
115 - Oh, I hear they have wonderful
steaks.\\
116 - Well, I don't particularly feel like
a steak.\\
117 - Steak sounds wonderful.
We'll go there.\\
118 - Now, wait just a minute, Lucy.\\
119 - What's the matter?\\
120 - Well, I just had about enough of
this.\\
121 - First you keep everybody waiting\\
122 - while you're fixing your nails.\\
123 - Then-then you keep interrupting me\\
124 - while I'm telling the story,\\
125 - and now you decide all by yourself\\
126 - where we're going to eat dinner\\
127 - because you want a steak.\\
128 - Well, Ricky, I...\\
129 - Well, I don't feel like eating steak
tonight.\\
130 - I want to eat spaghetti tonight.\\
131 - Well, maybe...\\
132 - So we're going to eat spaghetti.\\
133 - Yes, sir.\\
134 - And the next time that I tell a
story,\\
135 - you stay out of it.\\
136 - Yes, sir.\\
137 - And be on time from now on, or we're
going to go without you.\\
138 - Yes, sir.\\
139 - We're going to run this house like we
do in Cuba,\\
140 - where the man is the master\\
141 - and the woman does what she's told.\\
142 - Si, senor.\\
143 - And don't get smart.\\
144 - Now go get your coat.\\
145 - Oh, yeah?!\\
146 - Attagirl, Lucy.\\
147 - I was wondering what happened to you.\\
148 - It just sunk in.\\
149 - I don't know how you treat your women
in Cuba,\\
150 - but this is the United States,\\
151 - and I have my rights.\\
152 - I am not arguing about women's
rights.\\
153 - I am the first one to agree\\
154 - that women should have all the rights
they want\\
155 - as long as they stay in their place.\\
156 - That's telling her.\\
157 - Oh, you're just as bad as he is,
Fred.\\
158 - You men tell us that we have equal
rights,\\
159 - but you certainly don't give us a
chance\\
160 - to act like it.\\
161 - What do you want?\\
162 - You've got the vote, you wear pants,\\
163 - you drive buses, you wrestle.\\
164 - You go every place you please\\
165 - except the steam room in the Y.M.C.A.\\
166 - That isn't true.\\
167 - Equal rights means just what it
says--\\
168 - equal rights.\\
169 - Well, that's a good explanation.\\
170 - Oh, you know what she means.\\
171 - Yes, and we want to be treated that
way.\\
172 - From now on, everything is equal.\\
173 - We want to be treated exactly as if
we were men.\\
174 - Well, this calls for a little
conference.\\
175 - Pardon me, mister.\\
176 - Okay.\\
177 - From now on you have equal rights.\\
178 - We will treat you\\
179 - exactly as if you were men.\\
180 - Is it a deal?\\
181 - It's a deal.\\
182 - What about you, mac?\\
183 - It's a deal.\\
184 - Let's get our coats, Lucy.\\
185 - Listen, what did you say\\
186 - about this plumber that you...\\
187 - I phoned him this morning.\\
188 - He's coming out this afternoon...\\
189 - Ricky, that's my coat.\\
190 - I know that's your coat, honey.\\
191 - This is my coat over here.\\
192 - ...up this afternoon, checked
everything in the house.\\
193 - Oh, come on, let's put them on
ourselves.\\
194 - (all talking at once)\\
195 - Say, I was going to say\\
196 - when you came in the room,\\
197 - You like it?
that suit is just beautiful.\\
198 - Oh, I'm crazy about it.\\
199 - Thank you.\\
200 - One of the prettiest ones I ever saw.\\
201 - Oh!\\
202 - Pardon me, mister, my fault.\\
203 - You know this fellow looks familiar
to me.\\
204 - Reminds me of my father.\\
205 - This way, please.\\
206 - Thank you.\\
207 - The least you could do\\
208 - is pull out my chair for me.\\
209 - Never mind, Ethel.
They're just being smart.\\
210 - Ignore them.\\
211 - Honey, what are you talking about?\\
212 - We're just treating you as equals.\\
213 - Yeah, isn't that what you wanted?\\
214 - Oh.\\
215 - May I take your order?\\
216 - Yes, I think...\\
217 - I'd like some meatballs,\\
218 - spaghetti, and some pizza.\\
219 - Now, what would you like?\\
220 - Bring me some meatballs\\
221 - and spaghetti and pizza.\\
222 - And a little green salad.\\
223 - Green salad, yes.\\
224 - Now what would you like?\\
225 - And some coffee with my meal, please?\\
226 - Me, too.\\
227 - Now what will you have?\\
228 - Are you sure you're quite through?\\
229 - Yes, dear, go ahead and order.\\
230 - Don't keep the man waiting.\\
231 - Uh, I would like...\\
232 - Oh, dear, now I forgot what I wanted,\\
233 - you took so long ordering.\\
234 - Oh, yes, I'd like a steak, medium
rare\\
235 - and spaghetti on the side.\\
236 - Certainly, and you?\\
237 - I'll take the same, well done.\\
238 - Well done-- thank you.\\
239 - Oh, I dropped my purse, dear.\\
240 - Can you see it there?\\
241 - Yep.\\
242 - It's right there by my foot.\\
243 - Uh, would you excuse us a minute?\\
244 - We'll be right back.\\
245 - Where you going?\\
246 - Oh, we're just going to the
drugstore.\\
247 - We'll be back before the food gets
here.\\
248 - Fred...\\
249 - Oh, boy, that was a great meal.\\
250 - Wasn't that wonderful?\\
251 - We ought to come back here more
often.\\
252 - Yes, sir.\\
253 - Cigarette?\\
254 - Thank you.\\
255 - Light?\\
256 - Thank you.\\
257 - At least two of us are gentlemen.\\
258 - How do I look?\\
259 - Uh, we could both stand a repair job.\\
260 - Oh, you look all right.\\
261 - Um, how do I look, Fred?\\
262 - Pretty bad.\\
263 - I guess we could stand a repair job,
too.\\
264 - Always kidding.\\
265 - (whirring)\\
266 - Ricky, Ricky!\\
267 - Oh, now, Fred!\\
268 - Fred!\\
269 - This is a terrible thing...\\
270 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
271 - Oh, fellas, we get your message.\\
272 - All right, okay.\\
273 - Oh, now, Ricky, really.\\
274 - All right.
Equal rights, dear.\\
275 - Equal rights, equal rights.
All right.\\
276 - We get your point, we get your point.\\
277 - You win.\\
278 - Oh, really, boys.\\
279 - Oh, no.\\
280 - Well, I've seen everything now.\\
281 - All right, let's get the check\\
282 - and get out of here.\\
283 - Okay.\\
284 - Uh... Xavier?\\
285 - Yes, sir?\\
286 - Something more for you--\\
287 - more coffee, dessert...\\
288 - after-shave lotion?\\
289 - (laughs heartily)\\
290 - Just the check, please.\\
291 - He has a sense of humor.\\
292 - Pardon me a minute.\\
293 - LUCY: Honestly, it's getting so you
can expect anything\\
294 - from these two goofs we're married
to.\\
295 - ETHEL: That's the first time Fred's
shaved in a week.\\
296 - FRED: You should've seen the look on
your faces.\\
297 - Oh, that was a good meal.\\
298 - Uh-huh.
It really was.\\
299 - You two.\\
300 - Thank you, sir.\\
301 - Characters.\\
302 - What's this?\\
303 - Separate checks.\\
304 - What do you mean, separate checks?\\
305 - Equal rights, dear.\\
306 - Fred, aren't you going to pay for my
dinner?\\
307 - And take away your independence?
Never.\\
308 - All right, Ethel, we can go along
with the gag.\\
309 - I'll say. If you want to play it that
way, okay...\\
310 - Say, Lucy, have you got any...
I don't have any...\\
311 - What'd you say?\\
312 - Do you have any money?\\
313 - I haven't got a cent.\\
314 - I was going to put the bite on you.\\
315 - You took the bite right out of my
mouth.\\
316 - This is a little embarrassing, Rick.\\
317 - I didn't know we came to dinner\\
318 - with a couple of deadbeats.\\
319 - Well, you never can tell, Fred.\\
320 - Looks like.\\
321 - See you along...
see you around, gir... fellas.\\
322 - Oh, now, wait a minute.\\
323 - Come here now, Ricky.\\
324 - Oh, Fred, now wait a minute.\\
325 - That's carrying it a little too far.\\
326 - Ricky, Ricky, come here.\\
327 - Pardon me.\\
328 - What are you trying to do--\\
329 - skip out without paying?\\
330 - Well, our husbands were playing\\
331 - a little joke on us.\\
332 - They said we were going to have to
pay\\
333 - for our dinner.
Yes.\\
334 - But we don't have any money with us.\\
335 - Isn't that funny?\\
336 - Well, we'll go home\\
337 - and come right back with the money.\\
338 - We'll bring it right back to you.\\
339 - Well, what do you want us to do?\\
340 - (chuckles)\\
341 - You know what this is?\\
342 - It's a dish.\\
343 - Right.\\
344 - And we have lots more in the kitchen.\\
345 - People have been eating off them.\\
346 - They get so dirty.\\
347 - Just a minute!\\
348 - We're not washing any dishes.\\
349 - We're not washing any dishes, are we?\\
350 - Uh-huh.
Well, now, look, Xavier,\\
351 - don't tell them that I called.\\
352 - See, but as soon as they finish
washing the dishes,\\
353 - you call me and we'll come down and
pick them up.\\
354 - Okay, all right.\\
355 - (chuckles)\\
356 - Everybody's gone\\
357 - and they're still working their heads
off down there.\\
358 - Oh, girls...\\
359 - if you don't mind, will you let me
know when you're finished?\\
360 - I'll be in my office.\\
361 - I'm waiting to lock up!\\
362 - (mocking Xavier): He's waiting to
lock up.\\
363 - Oh, we don't mind.\\
364 - When you finish.\\
365 - Finish, waiting to lock up.\\
366 - I hope he never locks up.\\
367 - No!\\
368 - Those are clean.\\
369 - I never worked so hard in my life.\\
370 - Neither did I.\\
371 - I wonder where all these came from.\\
372 - I don't know.
I think he takes in\\
373 - dirty dishes from other restaurants.\\
374 - Honestly, every time I think of those
boobs we're married to,\\
375 - I just get furious.\\
376 - So do I.\\
377 - They make me so mad.\\
378 - Maybe this'll teach you to keep your
big mouth shut.\\
379 - Me? What do you mean?\\
380 - Well it was your idea about this
equal rights business.\\
381 - Just a minute.\\
382 - You thought it was a good idea then.\\
383 - Well, it stinks now.\\
384 - Well, it's nice to know\\
385 - that you're the kind of a person\\
386 - who turns on a friend in a crisis.\\
387 - Oh, listen, Lucy, I've been going
through\\
388 - this type of thing with you for 11
years.\\
389 - This is my last crisis.\\
390 - I'm through.\\
391 - (whimpering)\\
392 - Oh, don't cry.\\
393 - I didn't mean anything I said.\\
394 - I'm so upset!\\
395 - I know, so am I.\\
396 - Lucy, you mustn't cry anymore.\\
397 - You're right, I'm making the
dishwater cold.\\
398 - Oh, well, the main thing is\\
399 - to get these dishes done\\
400 - so we can get home.\\
401 - Yeah!\\
402 - Wait a minute.\\
403 - We don't have any money to get home
on.\\
404 - Oh, yeah.\\
405 - How do you like those husbands of
ours?\\
406 - We'll have to walk, all that way\\
407 - through those dark streets alone.\\
408 - Yeah, and I wouldn't be surprised\\
409 - if a thug jumped out from behind a
dark building\\
410 - and pounced on us and said, "Your
money or your life."\\
411 - And you know where that'll leave us.\\
412 - Oh, no.\\
413 - Yeah, and maybe he'll conk us on the
head\\
414 - and he'll leave us broken and
bleeding in an alley.\\
415 - And then Ricky and Fred'll be sorry.\\
416 - They'll be sorry?\\
417 - Hey, I know how we can get even with
them.\\
418 - How?\\
419 - Well, I'll call Ricky\\
420 - and I'll tell him that the
restaurant's being held up,\\
421 - and you yell, "Help!"\\
422 - and make noises like struggling\\
423 - in the background.\\
424 - Lucy, how do you think up all these
wonderful things?\\
425 - Promise me when you die,\\
426 - you'll leave your brain to science.\\
427 - Okay.\\
428 - Coast is clear.\\
429 - (phone rings)\\
430 - Hello?\\
431 - Hello, Ricky, this is Lucy.\\
432 - It's Lucy.\\
433 - Where are you, honey?\\
434 - Oh, we're still at the restaurant.\\
435 - They made us do the dishes.\\
436 - No.\\
437 - Yeah, but we're almost finished,\\
438 - and we were wondering if you could
come and...\\
439 - Oh. Oh, now-now you stay away from
me.\\
440 - You stay away from me with that gun.\\
441 - (screaming)\\
442 - What's the matter, honey?!
What's the matter?!\\
443 - Two masked men just came in with
guns.\\
444 - What? What's going on?!\\
445 - FRED: What's the matter?\\
446 - (with deep voice): This is a stickup.\\
447 - Don't move or I'll shoot.\\
448 - Honey, what's the matter?\\
449 - Help! Murder! Police!\\
450 - Don't shoot!\\
451 - Don't come near me with that gun, and
don't hit Ethel.\\
452 - Don't you dare hit Ethel.\\
453 - Don't you dare hit Ethel!\\
454 - (both groaning)\\
455 - Help! Murder!\\
456 - Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!\\
457 - Don't shoot!\\
458 - (screaming)\\
459 - Don't shoot.
Save us.\\
460 - Somebody save us!\\
461 - Oh, come and save us.\\
462 - Help! Help!\\
463 - (scream and groaning dramatically)\\
464 - (coughs)\\
465 - (imitates dying)\\
466 - Honey, what's the matter?\\
467 - Honey, what's going on!\\
468 - Please, what's the matter?\\
469 - Lucy, please.\\
470 - Two-two-two-two bandits down there
with guns.\\
471 - They're holding up the restaurant.\\
472 - I'll call the police.\\
473 - No, let me call the police.\\
474 - Wait a minute.\\
475 - Information.\\
476 - Information, give me the police.\\
477 - The police! Police!\\
478 - P-O-L-S-I-C. Police.\\
479 - Give me the phone.\\
480 - I'll talk to the police.\\
481 - Policia, le habla senor Ricky
Ricardo.\\
482 - Mi senora esta en un restaurante
alla...\\
483 - Give me the phone!\\
484 - What are you doing, calling the Cuban
police?\\
485 - Hurry up!\\
486 - Hello! They're holding up a
restaurant\\
487 - at 39th near Eighth.\\
488 - Never mind who this is.\\
489 - Just meet us there.\\
490 - Meet us there, that's right.\\
491 - Come on, let's go.\\
492 - The cops aren't here yet.\\
493 - We'll have to do it ourselves.\\
494 - Grab a chair.\\
495 - How do you like that?\\
496 - What a dirty trick to scare us half
out of our wits like that.\\
497 - Oh, boy, they got even with us, all
right.\\
498 - Yeah.\\
499 - And they'll never know it.\\
500 - I'll say they won't.\\
501 - Come on, now let's get out of here.\\
502 - No, wait a minute.\\
503 - This story about the bandits is too
good to pass it up.\\
504 - Yeah?\\
505 - You got a handkerchief?\\
506 - Yeah.\\
507 - Oh.\\
508 - Well, that's it.\\
509 - Just got to move those over there,\\
510 - and we're finished.\\
511 - Oh, boy.\\
512 - Here we go.\\
513 - What a night.\\
514 - (screams)\\
515 - (dishes crash)\\
516 - Ethel, what's the matter with you?\\
517 - Are you crazy or something?\\
518 - What's the matter with you?\\
519 - (screams)\\
520 - (both shrieking)\\
521 - (laughing)\\
522 - (laughing continues)\\
523 - Ricky Ricardo.\\
524 - Fred Mertz.\\
525 - (mocking Lucy): Two bandits are
holding us up.\\
526 - Ahh!! Ahhh!\\
527 - Look at these brave women.\\
528 - All right, you guys, let's go.\\
529 - Now, wait a minute, fellows!\\
530 - What's the matter with you guys?\\
531 - Are you crazy or something?\\
532 - This is all a joke.\\
533 - A joke?\\
534 - Sure, it's a joke.\\
535 - These are our wives here.\\
536 - That's right.\\
537 - Our sweet, loving, little wives.\\
538 - Sure.\\
539 - Well, you see, they acted...\\
540 - Look, they wanted equal rights,\\
541 - so we said fine, we give you equal
rights.\\
542 - From now on we treat you just like
you were men.\\
543 - So we came down here to this
restaurant,\\
544 - we said give us separate checks to
the head waiter.\\
545 - You know, I tell him the whole story.\\
546 - So the head waiters come and gives us
separate checks.\\
547 - They don't have any money to pay.\\
548 - I was in cahoots with the guy.\\
549 - So he tells them, all right, you have
to wash the dishes.\\
550 - To teach them a story\\
551 - we let them go here and wash the
dishes.\\
552 - Now they called the house, and just
to scare us\\
553 - they tell us there is a couple of
bandits down here with guns\\
554 - and they're holding us up.\\
555 - So he and I, we come down here\\
556 - like a couple of jerks to save them,\\
557 - and we realize there's no bandits
around in here.\\
558 - So we said okay, we can't lose this
chance.\\
559 - We put the handkerchiefs and the hats
and the stuff\\
560 - and we come in here with the gun,\\
561 - and it was, you know, just to scare
them,\\
562 - and that's all there was to it, for
goodness sakes.\\
563 - (laughing)\\
564 - Isn't that right, honey?\\
565 - We never saw them before in our
lives.\\
566 - (all yelling at once)\\
567 - All right you guys, stand up.\\
568 - The girls you held up\\
569 - want to take another look at you\\
570 - before they sign the complaint.\\
571 - This way, ladies.\\
572 - Mean looking, aren't they?\\
573 - Yeah.\\
574 - Lucy...\\
575 - Fresh, too, calls me by my first
name.\\
576 - The young one isn't so bad looking.\\
577 - He has a certain amount of animal
charm.\\
578 - I guess this old shriveled up one is
his father.\\
579 - They're no good, lady.\\
580 - Anybody can see that.\\
581 - We'll all be better off\\
582 - if you could sign the complaint\\
583 - and we can put them away.\\
584 - Okay.\\
585 - Oh, wait a minute.\\
586 - Uh, you know, the more I look at him,\\
587 - the cuter he gets.\\
588 - I wonder how he kisses.\\
589 - Kisses?\\
590 - Not bad.\\
591 - Wonder how grandpa kisses.\\
592 - Eh...\\
593 - Close your mouth and open the door.\\
594 - (giggling)\\
595 - Equal rights.\\
596 - Equal rights.\\
597 - Equal rights.\\

\subsection {Episode 05: Baby Pictures}
1 - (I Love Lucy theme music plays)\\
2 - Hi, dear.\\
3 - I picked up the baby pictures.\\
4 - Oh, let me see, let me see.\\
5 - Wait a minute.
Let go.\\
6 - Honey, I haven't seen them either.\\
7 - Oh, honey, I don't want you to see
them before I do.\\
8 - Honey, we'll look at them together.\\
9 - Well, all right.\\
10 - Gee, I can hardly wait to see what
they look like\\
11 - after all we went through taking
them.\\
12 - What do you mean "we went through"?\\
13 - I took them, remember.\\
14 - Oh, sure, but I was the one that had
to stand on my head\\
15 - to make Little Ricky laugh.\\
16 - Oh, honey, they gave you the wrong
pictures.\\
17 - This is a picture of twins.\\
18 - But they're both Little Ricky.\\
19 - How did you manage that?\\
20 - Oh, it's double exposure.\\
21 - It can happen to anybody.\\
22 - Oh.\\
23 - There's only one of him in that shot.\\
24 - Yeah, but that's so blurry.\\
25 - You take wonderful x-rays, dear.\\
26 - Well, I can't help it if he moved.\\
27 - Oh, look.\\
28 - Isn't that great?\\
29 - Hey, I'm a pretty good photographer
after all.\\
30 - Oh, I'll say you are.\\
31 - Oh, here's another wonderful one.\\
32 - Oh, gosh!\\
33 - Oh, these pictures are good enough\\
34 - to be on the cover of a magazine.\\
35 - What magazine, Body Beautiful?\\
36 - Oh.\\
37 - Well, even professional photographers
are entitled\\
38 - to a boo-boo now and then.\\
39 - Oh, these pictures are much better\\
40 - than any pictures the Applebys ever
took of their baby.\\
41 - Well, we have an advantage over the
Applebys.\\
42 - Wait till they come over tonight\\
43 - and I show them what real baby
pictures look like.\\
44 - Wha-bup-bup-bup-bup--\\
45 - What's this about who coming over
tonight?\\
46 - Oh, didn't I tell you, dear?\\
47 - No, you didn't tell me, dear.\\
48 - Well, uh, Caroline and Charlie
Appleby\\
49 - are coming over tonight.\\
50 - Oh, no, they're not.\\
51 - My house is in no shape for company.\\
52 - You just call them right up,\\
53 - Look, honey...
tell them we can't see them tonight.\\
54 - Charlie wants to talk to me\\
55 - about a television show,\\
56 - so I asked him to come over\\
57 - and he's going to be here at 8:00.\\
58 - Yes, sir.\\
59 - Thank you.\\
60 - Wait till he pulls the pictures of
his baby out\\
61 - and I let him have it with these.\\
62 - (chuckles)\\
63 - What are you doing?\\
64 - We're not showing those pictures to
anyone.\\
65 - Why?\\
66 - Because of a vow that you and I made.\\
67 - Vow?\\
68 - Yes, before we had a baby,\\
69 - do you remember how bored we always
were\\
70 - when other people dragged out
pictures of their little darlings\\
71 - and insisted that we look at them?\\
72 - Yeah.\\
73 - And do you remember that we promised
each other\\
74 - that if we ever had a child\\
75 - that we wouldn't inflict his pictures
on other people.\\
76 - I know, honey,\\
77 - but Little Ricky's not like any
ordinary baby.\\
78 - I mean, he's so cute\\
79 - that people want to see his pictures.\\
80 - Yeah, I know.\\
81 - Well...\\
82 - No, now, that's what all parents
think.\\
83 - Now, we promised, Ricky.\\
84 - Okay, but I'm not going to be very
happy\\
85 - when Charlie starts bragging about
his little brat.\\
86 - Well, so long as we're not boring
people\\
87 - with pictures of our kid...\\
88 - Charlie wants you to do a television
show?!\\
89 - Well, that's certainly a delayed
reaction.\\
90 - What kind of a show?
When is it going to be?\\
91 - Who's going to be in it?\\
92 - Variety, next Thursday, and not you.\\
93 - Now, Ricky, please.\\
94 - Look, honey, look...\\
95 - I'm only the master of ceremonies.\\
96 - I don't hire the talent,\\
97 - I have nothing to do with the talent,\\
98 - so there's nothing I can do for you.\\
99 - But if you did and you were, would
you?\\
100 - But I don't, and I'm not.\\
101 - But if you did, and you were, would
you?\\
102 - If I did, and I were, I would.\\
103 - Well, now I don't know what we said.\\
104 - But I guess as long as you're not,\\
105 - it doesn't matter.\\
106 - That's the sensible way to look at
it.\\
107 - Now, honey, remember we're not
showing those pictures\\
108 - to anybody tonight.\\
109 - Okay, okay.\\
110 - Isn't he cute?\\
111 - Oh, these are wonderful pictures,
Ricky.\\
112 - How about that one, eh?\\
113 - Yeah, I like this one\\
114 - where he's got the baseball cap on.\\
115 - He's a cutie, all right.\\
116 - Hey, that's a pretty good idea for a
picture,\\
117 - putting a baseball cap on him.\\
118 - Yeah, I'll say it is.\\
119 - I thought of that.\\
120 - Very clever.\\
121 - Look at this one here.\\
122 - Oh, he took a picture\\
123 - of the doll we gave him.\\
124 - That's his favorite doll.\\
125 - And Lucy's embroidered his name\\
126 - on his little suit.\\
127 - Yeah, Ricky, Jr.\\
128 - Ricky, what are you doing with those
pictures?\\
129 - He was showing them to us.\\
130 - You promised not to show them to
anybody.\\
131 - Well, the Mertzes aren't anybody.\\
132 - Well! Thanks a lot.\\
133 - I didn't mean that.\\
134 - Lucy made me promise that I wasn't
going to bore people\\
135 - with the pictures of the baby.\\
136 - Well, he's certainly not boring us.\\
137 - We're his godmother and godfather.\\
138 - Sure, they're the kid's godfolks.\\
139 - Yeah, watch it, will you?\\
140 - Well, maybe it's all right for you,
but nobody else, remember.\\
141 - You mean you're not going to show
them to the Applebys?\\
142 - That's right.\\
143 - Oh, come on.
Oh, come on.\\
144 - Now, somebody has to take them down a
peg.\\
145 - That's right.\\
146 - Yeah.\\
147 - Nope.\\
148 - Oh, now, that's all they talk about.\\
149 - The way they act, you'd think they
invented babies.\\
150 - Exactly, and we don't want to be like
the Applebys.\\
151 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
152 - There they are, honey.\\
153 - Hello.
Hi, Lucy.\\
154 - The Applebys.
Hi, Caroline.\\
155 - How are you?\\
156 - Give me your coat.\\
157 - Hi, Fred, Ethel.\\
158 - Gee, I'm sorry we're late,\\
159 - but just as we walked out the door
tonight,\\
160 - guess what little Stevie did.\\
161 - Oh, yeah, it was the cutest thing\\
162 - you ever saw.
Tell them, honey.\\
163 - Now, mind you, he's only 13 months
old.\\
164 - CAROLINE: Well, just as we were
walking out the door,\\
165 - he looked up at us,\\
166 - raised his little hand and said,
"bye-bye."\\
167 - "Bye-bye"?\\
168 - All by himself, bye-bye.\\
169 - How about that, huh?\\
170 - Bye-bye.\\
171 - Yeah, how about that?\\
172 - All by himself.\\
173 - And only 13 months old, gee.\\
174 - Oh, that certainly is amazing.\\
175 - Is that a new dress you have on,
Caroline?\\
176 - This old rag?\\
177 - Yes.\\
178 - Oh, goodness, no.\\
179 - Let me see, What else did I want\\
180 - to tell you about little Stevie
darling?\\
181 - Um... um...\\
182 - Uh, Charlie, how's everything down at
the television station?\\
183 - Oh, great, Rick, just great.\\
184 - We've got the newest\\
185 - moving pictures in town.\\
186 - You know, I bought a block of films
yesterday,\\
187 - and I want to tell you\\
188 - that they're going to make television
stars\\
189 - out of some of the actors.\\
190 - No kidding.
Yes, sir.\\
191 - Now, just remember their names--\\
192 - Conway Turrell and Mabel Norman.\\
193 - Yeah, well, we'll catch them.\\
194 - We never...
we always watch\\
195 - your television station.\\
196 - Well, that's what makes a station
popular--\\
197 - good pictures.\\
198 - (gasps): Good pictures!\\
199 - Oh, we've got some new pictures of
Stevie.\\
200 - Do you want to see them?\\
201 - They're right here.
They're just marvelous.\\
202 - You know, Charlie took them the other
day\\
203 - on his first birthday.\\
204 - Look at this one--\\
205 - he's trying to blow out the candle.\\
206 - (lame chuckle)\\
207 - CAROLINE: Aw...\\
208 - Oh, cute.\\
209 - CHARLIE: Look at the little dickens.\\
210 - He put his hand in the cake.\\
211 - I tell you,\\
212 - that little Stevie's a natural-born
comic.\\
213 - Natural-born.\\
214 - CAROLINE: Oh! Oh, this one...\\
215 - this one is the best one of all.\\
216 - The hat one.\\
217 - Oh, Charlie thought of the cutest
idea.\\
218 - Well, you know, he's just a genius\\
219 - about these things anyway.\\
220 - Do you know what he did?\\
221 - He put a baseball cap\\
222 - on little Stevie.\\
223 - Isn't that priceless?\\
224 - Yeah, priceless.\\
225 - Ready?\\
226 - Yeah, I'm ready.\\
227 - (chuckles)\\
228 - It isn't because he's my child, Rick,\\
229 - but I ask you, did you ever see\\
230 - a baby who took a better picture?\\
231 - Did I, honey?\\
232 - No, you didn't.\\
233 - I didn't.\\
234 - You know, from the moment he was born\\
235 - little Stevie was perfectly shaped...\\
236 - absolutely handsome.\\
237 - That's right.\\
238 - You know how most babies are--\\
239 - all red and pinched and
funny-looking.\\
240 - Yeah. Say, how is Little Ricky,
anyway?\\
241 - ALL: What?\\
242 - Lucy, Charlie didn't mean\\
243 - that Little Ricky was all red and
pinched and funny-looking.\\
244 - He outgrew that, didn't he?\\
245 - Now, you want to see a picture of a
baby, look at this.\\
246 - Now, there's a baby!\\
247 - RICKY: Look at those eyes.\\
248 - Lucy!\\
249 - Oh, I was just on my way over to your
place.\\
250 - Here's some money for the cleaning.\\
251 - Will you pay the man when he comes?\\
252 - Sure, where are you going?\\
253 - Oh, I just thought I'd drop by\\
254 - and see Caroline Appleby.\\
255 - Caroline Appleby?\\
256 - I thought you were mad at her last
night.\\
257 - I was and I still am.\\
258 - Well, then why are you going over
there?\\
259 - I just decided to take Little Ricky
over there\\
260 - and show her what a cute baby really
looks like.\\
261 - Oh, Lucy, honestly.\\
262 - Well, I don't care.\\
263 - Little Ricky's twice as handsome\\
264 - as that scrawny little runt of
theirs.\\
265 - Of course he's handsomer than their
child,\\
266 - but you'll have to admit\\
267 - some of their pictures were kind of
cute.\\
268 - One more remark like that\\
269 - and you can turn in your godmother
suit.\\
270 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
271 - Little Ricky's wearing his brand-new
outfit,\\
272 - but I don't suppose that interests
you.\\
273 - Oh, isn't he precious?\\
274 - As precious as little Stevie Appleby?\\
275 - He's ten times preciouser\\
276 - than that silly-looking little goon.\\
277 - You may kiss your reinstated
godmother.\\
278 - Oh, thank you.\\
279 - Put on your little hatsy.\\
280 - Lucy, aren't you being kind of mean\\
281 - dropping in on Caroline unannounced\\
282 - with Little Ricky\\
283 - all dressed up like that?\\
284 - Yeah.\\
285 - Oh, I see.\\
286 - I guess all's fair\\
287 - in love and motherhood.\\
288 - That's right, here we go.\\
289 - Byesie-byesie.\\
290 - Bye-bye, honey.\\
291 - Say bye-bye, Ricky.\\
292 - Bye-bye, darling.\\
293 - Say bye-bye.
Say bye-bye.\\
294 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
295 - Who is it?\\
296 - Lucy Ricardo.\\
297 - Lucy...\\
298 - Oh, Lucy, how nice of you to drop by.\\
299 - Uh... come on up.\\
300 - (knock at door)\\
301 - Come in.\\
302 - Oh, hello, Caroline.\\
303 - Why, Lucy, you've got Ricky with you.\\
304 - Yes, I hope we haven't come at an
inopportune time.\\
305 - Oh, no, I was just sitting here
relaxing.\\
306 - Oh.\\
307 - Uh...\\
308 - Oh, Lucy,\\
309 - you'll just have to forgive the mess
the apartment's in.\\
310 - I just haven't had a chance\\
311 - to do a thing this morning.\\
312 - Well, that's all right.\\
313 - I hope we haven't come at the wrong
time for little Stevie.\\
314 - He isn't sleeping or all dirty or
something, is he?\\
315 - No, no, he's all dressed up.\\
316 - As a matter of fact, I was just
waiting\\
317 - for his grandmother to come for him.\\
318 - Oh.\\
319 - I'll go get him.\\
320 - Oh, all right.\\
321 - Take your coat off, baby.\\
322 - Take your coat off, come on now.\\
323 - There we go.\\
324 - Now, you wait for little Stevie.\\
325 - You wait for little Stevie.\\
326 - Here we are.\\
327 - Now...\\
328 - say hello to Little Ricky, Stevie.\\
329 - Say hello, Stevie.\\
330 - There.
Say hello.\\
331 - Say hello.\\
332 - Oh, little sweetie.\\
333 - Uh, my, Stevie's grown a lot since I
last saw him.\\
334 - Oh, yeah, he's really shooting up.\\
335 - Oh, yes, when do you think he'll
reach normal size?\\
336 - He's exactly the size he's supposed
to be.\\
337 - He just seems small to you\\
338 - 'cause you're so used to looking at
little fatty here.\\
339 - Fatty?\\
340 - Oh, yes.\\
341 - I just love chubby, puffy little
boys.\\
342 - Oh, Ricky, you're going to have to go
on a diet\\
343 - or you'll grow up to look like your
mommy.\\
344 - What's new, Caroline?\\
345 - Well...\\
346 - Oh, say, what if I take the children\\
347 - and put them outside in Stevie's
playpen?\\
348 - Then they can get acquainted.\\
349 - Well, all right.\\
350 - All righty.\\
351 - There.\\
352 - There you are.\\
353 - Now, you be good little boys.\\
354 - Oh!\\
355 - Now, what were we saying?\\
356 - Oh, yes, you were just asking me
what's new.\\
357 - Yes.\\
358 - Well, I hate to sound like the doting
mother,\\
359 - but what do you think little Stevie
did today?\\
360 - Don't tell me he took a picture of
you for a change.\\
361 - No, he put two words together for the
first time.\\
362 - Not until today?\\
363 - Oh, don't tell me\\
364 - that Little Ricky has ever put two
words together.\\
365 - Why, certainly, dear.\\
366 - I don't mean da-da.\\
367 - Of course not.\\
368 - Has he ever said, "Morning, Mommy"?\\
369 - In English or Spanish?\\
370 - He speaks Spanish?\\
371 - Only when he's mad.\\
372 - Well, Lucy, it certainly was chummy
of you\\
373 - to drop by like this today.\\
374 - How long must you stay?\\
375 - Well, I hate to rush off like this,\\
376 - but I really must.\\
377 - Oh, that is a smart suit you're
wearing.\\
378 - Oh, do you like it?\\
379 - You know I always have.\\
380 - I'd like my baby, please.\\
381 - Where do you keep your child's cage?\\
382 - Well!\\
383 - I just hope that little glutton of
yours\\
384 - hasn't taught my Stevie any bad
habits.\\
385 - That goes double.\\
386 - My little Stevie doesn't have any bad
habits.\\
387 - I hope he doesn't copy any of his
good habits\\
388 - like scratching himself or peeling
bananas with his feet.\\
389 - Thanks for a lovely time.\\
390 - You're welcome.\\
391 - So I said, "Well, I hope Little Ricky
doesn't copy\\
392 - "any of his good habits like
scratching himself\\
393 - or peeling bananas with his feet,"
and we left.\\
394 - Oh, Lucy, what's this going to do\\
395 - to Ricky's TV show tomorrow?\\
396 - Charlie will probably cancel the
whole thing.\\
397 - Oh, Ricky's going to be furious.\\
398 - I know, but I couldn't help it.\\
399 - I felt like a mother bear defending
her cub.\\
400 - Well, when you tell him,\\
401 - I'd hate to be in your shoes.\\
402 - It's not my shoes I'm worried about.\\
403 - Hi, honey.\\
404 - Hi, Ethel.\\
405 - Hi.
Hi.\\
406 - Ethel, I come over to tell you\\
407 - I'm going to the market to get a
chicken.\\
408 - A chicken?\\
409 - I got one in the oven.\\
410 - (gasps)\\
411 - Oh, I forgot all about it!\\
412 - Never mind, it's too late.\\
413 - Is it very burned?\\
414 - Well, if we had three and 20 more,\\
415 - we could bake them in a pie.\\
416 - Oh, dear.\\
417 - Hey, I was just telling Fred\\
418 - about rehearsal for the television
show.\\
419 - It was wonderful.
It's going to be\\
420 - a great show tomorrow night.\\
421 - Oh?\\
422 - Oh. Uh-oh.\\
423 - Well, come on, Fred.
Let's go.\\
424 - Well, what's your rush?\\
425 - Well, we got get to the market\\
426 - and get a chicken right now.
Oh, all right, all right.\\
427 - Oh, those two.\\
428 - Uh... Ricky?\\
429 - Yes, honey.\\
430 - Uh, I was just thinking\\
431 - about your television show for
Charlie Appleby.\\
432 - I don't think that's a very good
thing for you.\\
433 - Not a good thing for me?\\
434 - Why, it's my big chance to get in my
own television show.\\
435 - Well, what do you want with that?\\
436 - Television isn't going to last.\\
437 - It's just a fad.\\
438 - A fad?\\
439 - Yeah, like flagpole-sitting or
swallowing goldfish.\\
440 - Lucy, what are you talking about?\\
441 - Well, besides, Charlie's...\\
442 - Charlie's station doesn't come in
clear.\\
443 - You get all distorted.\\
444 - What?\\
445 - Yeah, you look all funny like this.\\
446 - Babalu, babalu, babalu, ay-aye.\\
447 - Lucy, what are you up to?\\
448 - Nothing, but I just don't want you
disappointed\\
449 - if television turns out to be a big
flop.\\
450 - Well, honey, thank you very much,\\
451 - but I'll take my chances.\\
452 - Oh.\\
453 - I think I'll call Caroline\\
454 - and see what she's doing tomorrow
night.\\
455 - Okay.\\
456 - Oh, hello.\\
457 - Oh, hello, Charlie?\\
458 - Oh, Charlie, this is Lucy...\\
459 - Lucy Ricardo.\\
460 - Oh, fine, thanks.\\
461 - Is Caroline th...?\\
462 - What?\\
463 - Oh, Charlie, that's terrible.\\
464 - The cameraman?\\
465 - Mumps?!\\
466 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
467 - And the studio's going to be
quarantined?\\
468 - And you won't be able to make any
shows there\\
469 - for a couple of weeks, huh?\\
470 - Oh, well, I'll tell Ricky...\\
471 - (telephone rings)
I'll...\\
472 - I'll tell Ricky...\\
473 - (telephone rings)\\
474 - Well...\\
475 - (telephone rings)\\
476 - Hello.\\
477 - Oh, hello, Charlie, this is Ricky.\\
478 - Charlie, I don't...\\
479 - But Charlie, I...\\
480 - but...\\
481 - but...\\
482 - Charlie, Ch...
Don't hang up, Charlie.\\
483 - I'll explain.\\
484 - That was Charlie.\\
485 - Charlie who?\\
486 - You know Charlie who.\\
487 - What did you say to Caroline?\\
488 - Caroline who?
Oh, Charlie who's wife?\\
489 - Yeah.\\
490 - And I don't get the job.\\
491 - Well, that's show business.\\
492 - You know, there's no business like
show business.\\
493 - Yesterday, they told you you will not
go far.\\
494 - Tomorrow, on your dressing room, they
hang a star?\\
495 - Lucy, what did you say to Caroline?\\
496 - Nothing. Nothing that should upset
her.\\
497 - I just said that little Stevie\\
498 - was scrawny and little and looked
like a monkey.\\
499 - Oh, is that all?\\
500 - Yeah.\\
501 - What did you say that for?!\\
502 - What did you say that for?!\\
503 - What did you have to go over there
for?\\
504 - Why don't you stay here where you
belong?\\
505 - What are you trying to do to me?\\
506 - Well?\\
507 - I'm still working on what'd I say
that for?\\
508 - Uno de estos dias te voy a...\\
509 - (makes cracking sound)\\
510 - You wouldn't dare.\\
511 - Okay, now, you started this,\\
512 - so you're going to finish it.\\
513 - Well, what'll I have to do?\\
514 - You're going to get me\\
515 - back on that television show.\\
516 - How?\\
517 - I don't know how,\\
518 - but if you dun't, All right.\\
519 - I'll, I'll...
I will, I will, Ricky.\\
520 - I'll get you back on the show.\\
521 - Don't even think of what you'll do if
I "dun't."\\
522 - Ahora, i¡¡que va!\\
523 - If you're romantic, chum\\
524 - Pack up your thoughts and come to
Acapulco\\
525 - You put your cares in hock\\
526 - And throw away your clock in Acapulco\\
527 - Where you can be as lazy\\
528 - As a daisy drifting in a blue lagoon\\
529 - You're wide awake at night\\
530 - Because you do your dreaming in the
afternoon.\\
531 - You'll get a Latin glow way down in
Mexico\\
532 - Below the border\\
533 - And in a spot like this, if you
refuse a kiss\\
534 - You're out of order\\
535 - And when the moon is new, it's like a
honeydew\\
536 - Come on and get yourself a slice\\
537 - And if you can't say Acapulco\\
538 - Then you can call it paradise.\\
539 - Yeah!\\
540 - Look out, look out, look out.\\
541 - You'll need some new huaraches\\
542 - When the mariachis start to play
there\\
543 - And after you depart\\
544 - You know your crazy heart may want to
stay there\\
545 - And if the moon is new, it's like a
honeydew\\
546 - Come on and get yourself a slice\\
547 - And if you can't say Acapulco\\
548 - Then you can call it paradise\\
549 - And if I haven't sold you with the
things I've told you\\
550 - Then I must repeat it twice\\
551 - That if you can't say Acapulco\\
552 - Then you can call it paradise.\\
553 - (applause)\\
554 - Thank you.\\
555 - Thank you, thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.\\
556 - And now I have a surprise for you.\\
557 - You know, most performers don't like\\
558 - to have babies with them in their
show\\
559 - because they say that the babies
always steal all the scenes.\\
560 - But my wife found such a cute baby
today,\\
561 - such an adorable child with such
great personality,\\
562 - so beautiful, so intelligent,\\
563 - that she insisted that I put this
child on the show tonight.\\
564 - So now, ladies and gentlemen,\\
565 - it is my pleasure to introduce to you\\
566 - my wife, Lucy, with her idea of the
most beautiful baby\\
567 - in the whole wide world.\\
568 - And here they are--\\
569 - Lucy and little Stevie Appleby.\\

\subsection {Episode 06: Lucy Tells the Truth}
1 - (I Love Lucy theme music plays)\\
2 - Oh, no!\\
3 - Isn't it awful when something like
that\\
4 - happens right out on the stage\\
5 - and there's nothing you can do about
it?\\
6 - I know.\\
7 - Is anybody hungry?\\
8 - Hey, Fred, do you remember what
happened\\
9 - to that quick- change artist--\\
10 - you know, the one who used to change\\
11 - her clothes in the dark\\
12 - right out on the stage?\\
13 - Do I? Boy, was she ever mad at that
electrician.\\
14 - What happened?\\
15 - Well, she called for her tights\\
16 - and he thought she said "lights."\\
17 - Uh... it's very amusing.\\
18 - Oh, I'm sorry, Lucy.\\
19 - Oh, we shouldn't talk about our old
times\\
20 - in show business in front of Lucy.\\
21 - It makes her feel left out.\\
22 - Oh, no, it doesn't.\\
23 - Yeah.\\
24 - If you haven't been in show business
yourself,\\
25 - it must all seem kind of dull.\\
26 - I've been in show business.\\
27 - Well, Ethel means real show business\\
28 - not trying to get in Ricky's act.\\
29 - I've been in show business!\\
30 - Honey, Ethel means show business,\\
31 - not playing a petunia in a grammar
school recital.\\
32 - You think you know all there is\\
33 - to know about me, don't you?\\
34 - Remind me sometime to tell you\\
35 - about my experience in musical
comedy.\\
36 - Come on, Ethel, let's get some
coffee.\\
37 - Hey, just a minute.\\
38 - You were in musical comedy?\\
39 - It was before I met you, dear.\\
40 - Come on, Ethel.\\
41 - Now, wait, wait a minute.
This is very interesting.\\
42 - She's just exaggerating as usual.\\
43 - I am not.\\
44 - Well, what was the name of the
musical comedy?\\
45 - Oklahoma.\\
46 - Oklahoma?
Oklahoma?\\
47 - Oklahoma, and I was the star too.\\
48 - Yeah? What was your maiden name,\\
49 - Alfred Drake?\\
50 - Well, maybe I wasn't exactly the
star,\\
51 - but would you believe I was a
featured player?\\
52 - Chorus girl?\\
53 - Ticket taker?\\
54 - Lucy, why don't you tell the truth?\\
55 - You know that you were never in
Oklahoma.\\
56 - I was, too.\\
57 - I spent two weeks in Tulsa once.\\
58 - Why do you do it?\\
59 - You always fib and you always get
caught.\\
60 - I do not fib.\\
61 - I never told a fib in my life.\\
62 - Oh, there she goes again.\\
63 - Well, it isn't fibbing.\\
64 - I just like to...
color things a little.\\
65 - Well, why didn't you say so?\\
66 - I'll buy you some watercolors.\\
67 - Oh, you're all very funny.\\
68 - (door buzzer buzzes)\\
69 - Very funny.\\
70 - Oh, thank you.\\
71 - Flowers.\\
72 - Oh, Ricky, you shouldn't have.\\
73 - I din't.\\
74 - You "din't"?\\
75 - Oh, no, these are for you.\\
76 - For me?\\
77 - Who's sending you flowers?\\
78 - "Get well quick.\\
79 - Love, Jim and Dorothy."\\
80 - I feel fine.\\
81 - Oh, I know.\\
82 - I didn't want to go to dinner\\
83 - with Jim and Dorothy Wynn tonight,\\
84 - so I told them that you sprained your
ankle.\\
85 - There's another one.\\
86 - Oh, now, what's the matter with that?\\
87 - That's just a little social fib.\\
88 - Honey, you knew that we were\\
89 - going to have dinner with the
Mertzes.\\
90 - Why didn't you just tell them the
truth?\\
91 - You can't tell people the truth.\\
92 - They think you're lying.\\
93 - You have to lie to make them think
you're telling the truth.\\
94 - But it's not funny.\\
95 - You got to cut it out.\\
96 - Now, now, Ricky, don't be too tough
on Lucy.\\
97 - Thanks, Fred.\\
98 - She can't help it if she's a liar.\\
99 - Well!\\
100 - Oh, Fred didn't mean it like that.\\
101 - He just means the colorful way you
push the truth around\\
102 - is part of your character.\\
103 - Yeah. Molly McGee should have such a
fibber.\\
104 - Oh, I think you're all just horrid.\\
105 - I could tell the absolute truth like
everybody else\\
106 - if I wanted to be dull, present
company not excepted.\\
107 - RICKY: Honey, you couldn't tell the
absolute truth\\
108 - if your whole life depended on it.\\
109 - Would you like to risk a little money
on that proposition?\\
110 - I most certainly would.\\
111 - I'll tell you what.\\
112 - I'll bet you\\
113 - that you can't tell the truth for,
uh...\\
114 - For how long, one week?\\
115 - I'll make easy on you-- one day, 24
hours.\\
116 - Okay.\\
117 - How much you want to bet?\\
118 - Make it easy on yourself.\\
119 - Any part of $100.\\
120 - I'll take it all.\\
121 - Can I have a piece of that?\\
122 - I'd like a little of that, too.\\
123 - My friends.\\
124 - Oh, it hasn't anything to do with
friendship.\\
125 - It's just that there are so few sure
ways\\
126 - of making a buck these days.\\
127 - I'll tell you what, I'll take 50\\
128 - and I'll give you each 25.\\
129 - Thank you.
Fine.\\
130 - Uh... when do you want to start?\\
131 - It's one minute to 8:00.\\
132 - I'll start on the hour.\\
133 - Okay, you got yourself a bet.\\
134 - Okay.\\
135 - Did I ever tell you the time that
Cary Grant\\
136 - asked me marry him?\\
137 - It hasn't started yet.\\
138 - I just thought I'd have one last fib
for the road.\\
139 - Okay, it's started.\\
140 - For the next 24 hours.\\
141 - Okay.\\
142 - All right.\\
143 - I can hardly wait\\
144 - to hear you tomorrow afternoon, Lucy.\\
145 - Why?\\
146 - We're playing bridge at Caroline's,
remember?\\
147 - Oh, no, no, no.\\
148 - I can't spend the afternoon with
three women\\
149 - and have to tell the truth.\\
150 - I'll call Caroline and tell her I'm
sick.\\
151 - Eww...\\
152 - You'll go?\\
153 - I'll go.\\
154 - (knocking on door)\\
155 - Hi.\\
156 - Hi.\\
157 - How are you?\\
158 - Oh, look!\\
159 - Oh, Caroline, you've redecorated.\\
160 - Yep.\\
161 - Changed the whole mood of the room.\\
162 - My, I'll say.\\
163 - We threw out everything we had\\
164 - that was early American\\
165 - and started fresh with Chinese
modern.\\
166 - Here, let me take your coats.\\
167 - I'll put them in the bedroom.\\
168 - For heaven's sake.\\
169 - Gee, isn't this something, huh?\\
170 - Thank you.\\
171 - There.\\
172 - Look at this.\\
173 - This is really something, isn't it?\\
174 - And I thought it was awful before.\\
175 - It looks like...
I don't know what.\\
176 - I do.\\
177 - It looks like a bad dream\\
178 - you'd have after eating too much
Chinese food.\\
179 - Ooh.\\
180 - Well, how do you like my new
furniture?\\
181 - Oh, we were just talking about it.\\
182 - Weren't we, Lucy?\\
183 - What do you think?
Do you like it?\\
184 - Oh, I think it's just lovely.\\
185 - What do you think, Lucy?\\
186 - Uh...\\
187 - Oh, don't be bashful.\\
188 - Just tell her what you said to me.\\
189 - Oh, she doesn't want my little old
opinion.\\
190 - Oh, but I do, Lucy.\\
191 - Come on, now.\\
192 - Tell me exactly\\
193 - what you told Ethel about my
furniture.\\
194 - Well, uh... I said it looked like a
dream.\\
195 - Didn't I, Ethel?
Isn't that what I said?\\
196 - Yes.\\
197 - Oh, well, thank you.\\
198 - Oh, that's all right.\\
199 - What kind of a dream, Lucy?\\
200 - Well, let's play bridge.\\
201 - Lucy, we have to wait for Marian.\\
202 - Marian who?\\
203 - Marian Strong.\\
204 - When you're having four for bridge,\\
205 - it's always polite to wait\\
206 - until the fourth person arrives\\
207 - before you start playing.\\
208 - It's the only decent thing to do.\\
209 - Oh.\\
210 - Now, let's see.\\
211 - What were we talking about?\\
212 - Oh, yes...
Caroline's furniture.\\
213 - Uh, what kind of a dream, Lucy?\\
214 - Caroline, I told Ethel that your
furniture\\
215 - looked like a bad dream you'd have\\
216 - after eating too much Chinese food.\\
217 - Well!\\
218 - Is that what you really think?\\
219 - Yes.\\
220 - Well, Lucy, I hope it gives you\\
221 - a lot of pleasure to insult me.\\
222 - No, it doesn't.\\
223 - I don't like it any better than you
do.\\
224 - Well, nobody's twisting your arm.\\
225 - Oh, no?\\
226 - Before you get too mad, Caroline,\\
227 - I think you ought to know something.\\
228 - Last night, Ricky and Fred and I bet
Lucy $100\\
229 - that she couldn't tell the absolute
truth for 24 hours.\\
230 - Oh.\\
231 - So you see, it wasn't my fault.\\
232 - I was tricked into it by old sneaky
here.\\
233 - Well, that explains it,\\
234 - but it doesn't make me feel any
better.\\
235 - (knocking on door)\\
236 - Oh, Marian.\\
237 - Hi, Marian.
Hi, Caroline.\\
238 - How are you?\\
239 - Hi, Ethel.
How are you?\\
240 - Oh, Marian!\\
241 - That's a new hat.\\
242 - MARIAN: Yes.\\
243 - (Marian cackling with laughter)\\
244 - Do you like it?\\
245 - Oh, I think it's lovely.\\
246 - It's beautiful.\\
247 - Oh, thank you.\\
248 - Hi, Lucy.\\
249 - Hi, Marian.\\
250 - Uh, Lucy, Marian has on a new hat.\\
251 - Yeah, Marian.\\
252 - Take it off.\\
253 - Let's play bridge.\\
254 - Lucy, what do you think\\
255 - of Marian's new hat?\\
256 - Oh, that's a hat, all right.\\
257 - Yeah, but what do you think about it?\\
258 - Well, Marian, if that's the kind of
hat you wanted,\\
259 - you sure got a good one.\\
260 - (cackling laughter)\\
261 - No, seriously, Lucy.\\
262 - Well, Marian, nothing personal,\\
263 - but I think that's the silliest-
looking hat I've ever seen.\\
264 - Oh, now, come on, Lucy.\\
265 - Tell me what you think of it?\\
266 - I am serious.\\
267 - It's horrible.\\
268 - I think there's something you ought
to know.\\
269 - Last night, we bet Lucy $100\\
270 - that she couldn't tell the truth for
24 hours.\\
271 - Oh, no.\\
272 - (laughing)\\
273 - Then that's what she really thinks of
my hat.\\
274 - Come on, let's play bridge.\\
275 - That is if anyone still wants to play
with me.\\
276 - Uh... Marian,\\
277 - bring your things over here.\\
278 - (whispering inaudibly)\\
279 - Well, come on.\\
280 - Okay.\\
281 - Lucy, how old are you?\\
282 - How much do you weigh?\\
283 - What color would your hair be\\
284 - if you didn't dye it?\\
285 - 33... 129...
and mousy brown.\\
286 - Anything else you'd like to ask me?\\
287 - What?\\
288 - Go ahead, ask me anything you like--
I like it.\\
289 - It feels wonderful to tell the truth.\\
290 - (laughing)\\
291 - Now, she's trying to use\\
292 - psychology on us.\\
293 - No, I mean it.
I feel very relieved.\\
294 - It is wonderful to tell the truth.\\
295 - You should try it sometime.\\
296 - We'd all be much better friends.\\
297 - Somehow, I doubt that.\\
298 - Well, you do as you please.\\
299 - I feel great.\\
300 - Come on, let's play bridge.\\
301 - I'm your partner this week,\\
302 - aren't I, Caroline?\\
303 - Oh, I guess I play with you.\\
304 - And, Caroline, let someone else keep
score this week.\\
305 - You cheat.\\
306 - Yes, cheat.\\
307 - The last three times we've played,\\
308 - you added up the score\\
309 - in your favor.\\
310 - I would have said something about it\\
311 - if I hadn't been your partner.\\
312 - Well, I never!\\
313 - And you stop jabbering and keep your
mind on the game.\\
314 - You talk so much you don't know\\
315 - what cards have been played.\\
316 - (laughing)\\
317 - Well!\\
318 - Oh, I'm sorry, Ethel, but it's so
true.\\
319 - Marian, stop cackling.\\
320 - I've been waiting ten years for you
to lay that egg.\\
321 - For heaven's sake, Caroline,\\
322 - when are you going to get a new deck
of cards?\\
323 - We've been playing with this same
dirty old deck\\
324 - since I've known you.\\
325 - Hey, how about that fella?\\
326 - Listen, Ricky, show your Uncle Fred\\
327 - how I taught you how to wave bye-bye
this morning.\\
328 - Show him.
Bye-bye.\\
329 - Bye-bye.\\
330 - Bye-bye, Ricky.\\
331 - Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.\\
332 - Looks more like he's teaching us\\
333 - how to wave bye-bye.\\
334 - Well, he did it this morning.\\
335 - Now, look here, old man.\\
336 - You're going to have to learn\\
337 - how to perform on cue\\
338 - if you're going to be my son.\\
339 - Hi.\\
340 - Oh, here's your mommy.\\
341 - Oh, that's your mommy.\\
342 - Was he a good boy?\\
343 - He was an angel.\\
344 - Where's Ethel?\\
345 - She'll be right up.
Did you feed him?\\
346 - Yeah, I followed your instructions to
the letter.\\
347 - Looks like you fed a whole nursery
full of babies.\\
348 - Well, he was hungry.\\
349 - Come on, honey, we go beddy-bye.\\
350 - Bye, old man.
Bye.\\
351 - Say bye-bye.\\
352 - Bye.
Bye-bye.\\
353 - They never do what you want them to
do\\
354 - when you want them to do it.\\
355 - I know it.
I can't help it.\\
356 - Hi.\\
357 - BOTH: Hi.\\
358 - How was the bridge game?\\
359 - Oh, yeah, how did we do?\\
360 - Is the bet all over?\\
361 - Not at all.\\
362 - What?
Not at all?\\
363 - She never told one lie all afternoon.\\
364 - I don't believe it.\\
365 - What did she do, tape her mouth shut?\\
366 - I wish she had.\\
367 - She not only told the truth, but she
got brutally frank\\
368 - and told us all exactly what she
thought of us.\\
369 - Oh, boy, I wish I'd have been there.\\
370 - Oh, that must have been good.\\
371 - When you two hyenas get through
laughing,\\
372 - you can go dig up a hundred bucks
between you.\\
373 - Oh, don't be silly.\\
374 - She won't be able to keep it up.\\
375 - Not Lucy.\\
376 - (both laughing)\\
377 - What's so funny?\\
378 - Ethel was telling us what happened\\
379 - when you told the girls\\
380 - the truth this afternoon.\\
381 - Oh, yeah, they all got a little
miffed,\\
382 - but I don't care.\\
383 - I feel wonderful telling the truth.\\
384 - Well, I don't feel so wonderful\\
385 - finding out you hate to play bridge
with me.\\
386 - Well, I wouldn't if you'd stop
gabbing once in a while.\\
387 - Oh, you shut up, Fred.\\
388 - You're no rose.\\
389 - LUCY: I'll say he's not.\\
390 - Yeah.\\
391 - Why don't you buy Ethel a new dress
once in a while?\\
392 - Yeah, you tell him, Lucy.\\
393 - If you weren't such a tightwad,\\
394 - she wouldn't have to go around
looking so tacky.\\
395 - Tightwad?\\
396 - Tacky?\\
397 - Come on, let's get out of here.\\
398 - We don't have to be insulted.\\
399 - Now, wait a minute.\\
400 - Wait a minute, Fred and Ethel.\\
401 - I don't blame you for being a little
huffy\\
402 - but after all, we were the ones\\
403 - who forced Lucy to tell the truth.\\
404 - Well, that's right.\\
405 - And besides, a few truthful
criticisms\\
406 - would do us all a lot of good.\\
407 - Oh, that's easy for you to say.\\
408 - She hasn't said anything about you
yet.\\
409 - Yeah.\\
410 - Okay.\\
411 - Go ahead, Lucy, tell me my faults.\\
412 - Tell me what you really think of me.\\
413 - I think you are the most handsome,
the most wonderful,\\
414 - the cleverest and the most talented
man in the whole world.\\
415 - The truth didn't hurt me.\\
416 - Oh, brother.\\
417 - Can you think of any other faults of
mine?\\
418 - Yes, you're hammy, you're stubborn
and you're a coward.\\
419 - A coward?\\
420 - How do you like it now?\\
421 - She's really telling him, eh,
Tightwad?\\
422 - You said it, Tacky.\\
423 - Now, let's wait a minute.\\
424 - What is this business about being a
coward?\\
425 - I'm not afraid of anything.\\
426 - Yeah, he proves it\\
427 - every time he steps on the stage.\\
428 - Never mind the wisecracks.\\
429 - What is this coward routine?\\
430 - You are afraid\\
431 - that if I got half a chance at a
career\\
432 - that I would be the star of the
family.\\
433 - Oh, I see.
You would, eh?\\
434 - I have more talent in my little
finger\\
435 - than most people have in their whole
body.\\
436 - Uh-huh... well, I'll tell you what:\\
437 - I'm going to an audition tonight.\\
438 - They're casting\\
439 - for one of the biggest shows in
television.\\
440 - Why don't you come along?\\
441 - Okay, what'll I do?\\
442 - Well, why don't you let them audition
your little finger?\\
443 - What does it do-- sing, dance?\\
444 - Never mind.
I'll show you.\\
445 - Ethel, will you take care of Little
Ricky?\\
446 - Thank you.
I'll go get ready.\\
447 - What's the matter with you, Ricky?\\
448 - Yeah, you can't run out to an
audition.\\
449 - If she doesn't tell a lie by 8:00,\\
450 - we're out a hundred bucks.\\
451 - I know, I know.\\
452 - I just found a way how to...\\
453 - a way to win the bet\\
454 - and keep her quiet about show
business\\
455 - at the same time.\\
456 - You lost me.\\
457 - Well, look, I know\\
458 - the way that they conduct those
auditions,\\
459 - and she won't get to first base\\
460 - unless she can prove to them\\
461 - that she's got some experience.\\
462 - I don't get it.\\
463 - I do.\\
464 - If she lies about her experience\\
465 - to get a job, we win the bet,\\
466 - and if she doesn't lie\\
467 - about her experience,\\
468 - she won't get the audition.
Right.\\
469 - Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.\\
470 - Just give this to me slowly.\\
471 - Now, look, if she doesn't win...\\
472 - I can't understand where we come
into...\\
473 - Now, let me see-- who's next?\\
474 - Mercedes Minch.\\
475 - You've got a nice list of credits
here.\\
476 - "Sings like a chicken."\\
477 - Sings like a chicken?\\
478 - Well, this won't be\\
479 - the first "fowl" singer I've heard
today.\\
480 - Well, go right ahead, please.\\
481 - (piano plays)\\
482 - (clucking an aria)\\
483 - (crows like a rooster)\\
484 - Well, thank you very much.\\
485 - Don't call us.\\
486 - We'll call you when we need you.\\
487 - MAN: Now, let me see...\\
488 - What are you doing here?\\
489 - Who's with Little Ricky?\\
490 - We got Mrs. Trumbull to sit with him.\\

and dance today.\\

515 - What sort of an establishment is it?\\
516 - Oh, well, it's a three-ringed circus.\\
517 - Yes, it's quite a place.\\
518 - You should drop by some night.\\

527 - I was in 3D.\\
528 - You say you've appeared in Third
Dimension.\\
529 - No, sir, I did not.\\
530 - I said I was in 3D.\\
531 - Well, what's 3D if it isn't Third
Dimension?\\
532 - It's the number on our apartment.\\
533 - Well, I'm very sorry, Miss
McGillicuddy,\\
534 - but we're only interested in
professionals here.\\

12 - The new one, the one the Applebys
told us about.\\
13 - You remember?\\
14 - Okay. I'll go and see what's keeping
Mrs. Trumbull.\\
15 - Okay. Listen, Caroline said\\
16 - that the menus were all written in
French.\\
17 - Do you know how to read French?\\
18 - Sure, I can read it.\\
19 - Oh, good.\\
20 - But I can't understand it.\\
21 - Oh, great. Well, listen, Ethel took
French in high school\\
22 - and Fred was in France during the
first world war.\\
23 - Let's let them order and then we'll
take what they take.\\
24 - All right.\\

26 - There's Mrs. Trumbull.\\
27 - I'll let her in.\\

45 - Let me see it.\\
46 - There's English here.\\
47 - Where?\\
48 - Right here.\\
49 - "Acme Printing Corporation, union
shop."\\
50 - Oh, very funny.\\
51 - Well, I ought to be able to figure
out something\\
52 - on this thing.\\

war...\\
54 - "I was stationed in France."\\
55 - I know.\\
56 - Well, I was.\\
57 - You were there exactly three weeks.\\

59 - I know everything you learned,\\
60 - and they don't serve\\
61 - "hinky dinky parley vous" here.\\
62 - Well, I'll just ask the waiter\\
63 - to tell us what these things mean.\\
64 - Hey, garcon.\\
65 - (whistles)\\
66 - Don't whistle!\\
67 - I know what we'll do.\\
68 - We'll wait till Ricky orders\\
69 - and then we'll say we'll have some of
the same.\\
70 - Well, what makes you think he can
speak French?\\
71 - Well, he speaks Spanish,\\
72 - and all those foreign languages are
practically the same.\\
73 - Oh.\\
74 - Wouldn't you think I'd recognize
something on this thing?\\
75 - LUCY: Oh, hi.\\
76 - Oh, hi.
Oh, hi. You're late, you know.\\
77 - I'm sorry we're late.\\
78 - Well, he was getting hungry, of
course.\\
79 - Oh, isn't this fun?\\
80 - It's a real atmospheric type place,
isn't it?\\
81 - Yeah, I feel just like I was in
Paris.\\
82 - Ah, bonsoir, messieurs et mesdames.\\
83 - Oh, bonsoir.\\
84 - Bonswear.\\
85 - Oh, gee, doesn't everything look
delicious?\\
86 - It certainly does.\\
87 - What is madame's choice?\\
88 - Uh... oh, well,\\

90 - to make a choice.\\
91 - Uh, what are you going to have, Fred?\\
92 - Me?
Uh-huh.\\
93 - Oh, I don't know.\\
94 - What are you going to order, Rick?\\
95 - Well, I thought I'd have this--\\
96 - Oh, I beg your pardon, ladies first.\\
97 - Go ahead, Ethel.\\
98 - Oh, uh, I haven't decided yet.\\
99 - Lucy?\\
100 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
101 - I started this.\\
102 - Well, now, is anyone ready to order?\\
103 - Well, you go ahead, Fred.
You order first, Rick.\\
104 - You order first, Luce...
You order...\\
105 - You know, we could starve to death
like this.\\
106 - Now, someone has to go first.\\
107 - I would gladly go first, but I have
already eaten.\\
108 - Oh, well, I know, I'll count.\\
109 - One potato, two potato\\
110 - three potato, four...\\
111 - Please, allow me-- une pomme de terre\\

terre\\
114 - sept pommes de terre, c'est tout.\\
115 - Ma mere m'a dit de prendre a vous.\\
116 - Oh, well, that sounds good.\\
117 - Bring four orders of that.\\
118 - Madame, I was counting.\\
119 - You must order first.\\
120 - Oh...\\
121 - Oh, well, uh, let's see now.\\
122 - I'll have this.\\
123 - That?\\
124 - Yes.
I'll have the same.\\
125 - Me, too.\\
126 - So will I.\\
127 - Mesdames, messieurs...\\
128 - You heard our order.\\
129 - Will you please bring it?\\
130 - Please, could I not suggest something
else?\\
131 - No, this is what we want.\\
132 - Very well.\\
133 - Four orders of "Closed on Sundays."\\
134 - Please, allow me.\\
135 - I will bring you the specialite de la

136 - Un petit roti, des petits pois\\
137 - et quelque chose de pomme de terre
frite.\\
138 - Merci, monsieur.\\
139 - Oh!\\
140 - I was never so humiliated in my life.\\
141 - That is the most embarrassing thing\\
142 - that has ever happened to me.\\
143 - Aw, honey, you're 'zaggerating.\\
144 - I am not "zaggerating."\\
145 - So we can't read French.\\
146 - We're going to have a meal, aren't
we.\\
147 - That's right.
Who cares what they call it.\\
148 - Yes, but suppose you want to order\\
149 - the same thing next time.\\
150 - Well, I'll just wear the same tie\\
151 - and say, "Bring me some of this."\\
152 - Now, look, you can laugh all you
want,\\
153 - but we are going to do something
about this situation.\\
154 - We are?
Yes. We are going to take lessons\\
155 - and learn how to speak French.\\
156 - Not me.\\
157 - I had enough trouble learning how to
speak English.\\
158 - How about you, Fred?\\
159 - Are you kidding?\\
160 - Very well, Ethel, they'll be sorry.\\
161 - People will say\\
162 - "How could those two charming,
sophisticated\\
163 - cultured women ever marry those
uncouth slobs?"\\
164 - What does that mean, Fred?\\
165 - Well, "slobs" means...\\
166 - "Slobs" I know.\\
167 - What does this "uncouth" mean?\\
168 - Well, if you're uncouth,\\
169 - it means that...\\
170 - that you're not couth.\\
171 - Yeah, that's what I thought.\\
172 - Now, you listen to me.\\
173 - You can get just as couth as you
want,\\
174 - but just make sure\\
175 - that it doesn't cost me any money.\\
176 - "Doesn't cost me any money.\\
177 - Doesn't cost me any money."\\
178 - Ethel, did you ever take a good look
into his eyes?\\
179 - He has little dollar signs\\
180 - instead of pupils.\\
181 - "Doesn't cost me any money."\\
182 - (door buzzer sounds)\\
183 - Oh, it's you.\\
184 - Well, that's a nice, friendly
greeting.\\
185 - I'll see you later.\\
186 - Oh, come on in.
Don't be silly.\\
187 - I was expecting our French teacher.\\
188 - Our French teacher?\\
189 - Our French teacher, and for free.\\
190 - If you'd have been around this
morning,\\
191 - you'd have known about it.\\
192 - Oh, I had to go downtown.\\
193 - How'd you do it?
How'd it happen?\\
194 - Well, I got a brainstorm.\\
195 - I called that French restaurant.\\
196 - I thought maybe that waiter\\
197 - would be willing to give us lessons.\\
198 - He said he would, and for nothing.\\
199 - Oh, Lucy, that's wonderful.\\
200 - Why should he teach us for nothing?\\
201 - I don't know, and I didn't ask
questions.\\
202 - He'll be here any minute.\\
203 - Well, I'll be right back.\\
204 - You don't have to get fixed up, you
know.\\
205 - Fixed up?
Don't be silly.\\
206 - I just want to tell Fred I'm home.\\
207 - I'll be right back.
All right.\\
208 - I wouldn't leave you alone in your
apartment\\
209 - with a Frenchman who's going to give
you lessons for nothing.\\
210 - Oh, go on.\\
211 - Silly.\\
212 - (door buzzer sounds)\\
213 - Ah, bonjour, madame.\\
214 - Bonjour to you too.\\
215 - I'm Robert Dubois.\\
216 - Well, how do you do.
Won't you come in?\\
217 - Merci.\\
218 - Is your husband home?\\
219 - Now, just a minute.\\
220 - Let's get one thing straight.\\
221 - You came here to give me French
lessons.\\
222 - It doesn't matter whether my husband
is home or not.\\
223 - But you don't understand.\\
224 - I understand perfectly.\\
225 - Are you going to give me French
lessons or not?\\
226 - Oui, madame.\\
227 - Very well, that's better.\\
228 - Now, then, shall we start\\
229 - with the menu from the restaurant?\\
230 - No, no, no, no, no, no.\\
231 - We will begin the lesson\\
232 - with a few simple words.\\
233 - Repeat after me.\\
234 - Yes?
Le crayon.\\
235 - La crayawn.\\
236 - Le crayon.\\
237 - Le crayawn.\\
238 - La plume.\\

243 - La plooooom.\\
244 - La...\\
245 - Oh, no.\\
246 - Am I too late?\\
247 - Yes, years too late.\\
248 - Sit down.\\
249 - Oh, you're kidding with that, aren't
you?\\
250 - Uh, you remember Mrs. Mertz, this is
Robert Dubois.\\
251 - How do you do?\\
252 - How do you do?\\
253 - Have you learned anything yet?\\
254 - Oh, sure, it's simple.\\
255 - La crayawn and, uh, la ploom.\\
256 - Oh, that's wonderful.
What does it mean?\\
257 - The pencil, the pen.\\
258 - (gasps)\\
259 - Do you think you could teach us
enough French\\
260 - so that we could order in any French
restaurant?\\
261 - Absolument.\\
262 - He says he can.\\
263 - We were just starting\\
264 - with a few simple words.\\
265 - The pencil.\\
266 - Le crayon.\\
267 - Uh, le crayawn.\\
268 - Le crayawn.\\
269 - Le crayawn.\\

281 - La plooooom.\\
282 - La plooooom.\\
283 - Bon.\\
284 - Bon.
Bon.\\
285 - No, "bon" means good.\\
286 - Oh.
You are doing fine.\\
287 - You speaking French very well.\\
288 - Oh, yeah, we're in great shape\\
289 - if the restaurant we go to\\
290 - happens to serve pens and pencils.\\
291 - We will begin our vocabulary slowly.\\
292 - Table.\\
293 - LUCY: Table.\\
294 - Table.\\
295 - La table.\\
296 - La tabluh.\\
297 - La table.\\
298 - La tabluh.\\
299 - Let me try.\\
300 - Okay.\\
301 - La tabluh.\\
302 - La table.\\
303 - La tabluh.\\
304 - 'Bluh.\\
305 - Cat.\\
306 - What?\\
307 - Cat.\\
308 - Cat?
Cat.\\
309 - Oh, cat, cat, yes.\\
310 - Le chat.\\
311 - Le chat.\\
312 - Gee, French is a funny language.\\
313 - Why are some of 'em le and some of
'em la?\\
314 - You see, there is difference between
French and English.\\
315 - In French, everything, it is either
masculine or feminine.\\
316 - You Americans don't have that.\\
317 - You haven't been in this country very
long, have you?\\
318 - Oh, Lucy, that's very funny.\\
319 - Mrs. Ricardo, please.\\
320 - What?\\
321 - I do not know all the rules of
grammar.\\
322 - I am no teacher.\\
323 - Oh, I know, I know, you're a waiter.\\
324 - No, no, no, no, no, no.\\
325 - I am an entertainer.\\
326 - An entertainer?\\
327 - Oui, that is why when I found out who
you were,\\
328 - I agreed to teach you for nothing.\\
329 - I hope I could meet your husband and
be in one of his shows.\\
330 - What's French for sneaky waiter?\\
331 - You never get anything for nothing in
this world.\\
332 - Oh, Lucy, this is really too bad,
honestly.\\
333 - There's strings attached to
everything.\\
334 - Free French lessons.
Please, do not be angry.\\
335 - All I want is an introduction to your
husband.\\
336 - Just an introduction?\\
337 - Oui.\\
338 - Is that all you want?\\
339 - Oui.\\
340 - Well, okay, if you keep on giving us
free French lessons,\\
341 - I will introduce you to my husband,\\
342 - but that's all.\\
343 - Oui, madame, merci.\\
344 - Merci, you are very kind.\\
345 - Perhaps I could use my influence\\
346 - with Mr. Ricardo, too.\\
347 - Merci.\\
348 - Now we'll start to make a simple
sentence.\\
349 - Uh-huh.\\
350 - "The pencil is on the table."\\
351 - Le crayon est sur la table.\\
352 - BOTH: Lay crayawn est soor la tabluh.\\
353 - Lay crayawn est soor la tabluh.\\
354 - Lucy!\\
355 - Oh, mon husband, bonjour.\\
356 - Are you still on that French kick?\\
357 - I certainly am, and I took a lesson
today.\\
358 - And it didn't cost you a cent.\\
359 - Okay, that's fine.\\
360 - How did it go?\\
361 - Uh, bon, mo'seer.\\
362 - Uh, le crayawn est soor la tabluh.\\
363 - Muy bien.\\
364 - Uh, la maison est roosh.\\
365 - Magnifico.\\
366 - Gee, we sound so international.\\
367 - Yeah.\\
368 - Too bad we can't understand each
other.\\
369 - Yeah.\\
370 - Who's your teacher?\\
371 - Well, uh, the waiter from that French
restaurant.\\
372 - Oh?
He's coming over again tonight.\\
373 - Another lesson so soon?\\
374 - Well, not exactly.\\
375 - No, he's coming over to see you.\\
376 - Me? What does he want with me?\\
377 - Well, you see, he's really an
entertainer from Paris--\\
378 - Paris, France, that is--\\
379 - and he thought if he could just get
to talk to you,\\
380 - he might be able to get an audition
at the club\\
381 - and possibly be in one of the shows.
Lucy.\\
382 - Lucy...
He's-He's really a very... what?\\
383 - Lucy, there's one word\\
384 - that is exactly the same in Spanish\\
385 - in French and in English.\\
386 - What's that?\\
387 - No.\\
388 - But Ricky, all you have to do...\\
389 - He'll give us free French lessons\\
390 - if you just talk to him once.\\
391 - Just talk, say hello, how do you do,
anything.\\
392 - What's wrong with that?\\
393 - It wouldn't be fair to the guy,
honey.\\
394 - I couldn't possibly use a French
singer at the club.\\
395 - Why not?\\
396 - A real French act at the club might
be a good change of pace.\\
397 - No, no, no.\\
398 - Besides, French revues are very
popular now.\\
399 - They're all the rage-- you know,
Folies- Bergere type stuff\\
400 - and the cancan stuff and Moulin Rouge\\
401 - and Toulouse-Lautrec paintings all
around\\
402 - and all that frilly stuff.\\
403 - You know, as much...\\
404 - as much as I hate to admit it,\\
405 - you might have something there.\\
406 - Really?\\
407 - Hi.
Hi, kids.\\
408 - We were so dressed up,\\
409 - we decided to eat out again.\\
410 - Listen, Ethel, guess what?\\
411 - Ricky's going to star Robert Dubois\\
412 - in a French revue at the club, and
we're all going to be in it.\\
413 - We're all going to be in it?!\\
414 - (all talking at once)\\
415 - Hey, hey, Ricky, we can do our apache
dance we used to do.\\
416 - Watch.\\
417 - (humming song)\\
418 - That's the part I like--\\
419 - where I hit him.\\
420 - You should have seen us one night\\
421 - when we got mad.\\
422 - We darn near killed each other.\\
423 - Well, that's very clever,\\
424 - but don't call me\\
425 - and I won't call you.\\
426 - Oh, Ricky, you're mean.\\
427 - Okay, so I'm mean.\\
428 - Now, come on, let's cut out all the
auditions\\
429 - and let me see if I can figure out\\
430 - something about this French...\\
431 - Come on, let's go, let's go.\\
432 - Well, you don't have to go away mad.\\
433 - I'm not mad, I'm hungry.\\
434 - We'll see you later, honey.\\
435 - Okay.
So long.\\
436 - French revue...\\
437 - That might not be bad, at that.\\
438 - (imitating Maurice Chevalier): Every
little breeze seems to whisper Louise\\
439 - Birds in the trees seems to twitter
Louise.\\
440 - Yeah, might be all right at that.\\
441 - Like Chevalier kind of stuff, yeah.\\
442 - LUCY: Every little breeze\\
443 - Seems to twitter Louise.\\
444 - Birds...\\
445 - Every little breeze seems to whisper
Louise...\\
446 - Every little breeze\\
447 - Seems to whisper Louise.\\
448 - The birds in the trees\\
449 - They all twitter Louise...\\
450 - Alors.\\
451 - We seem to be overstocked\\
452 - on Maurice Chevaliers.\\
453 - (door buzzer sounds)\\
454 - Oh, you characters.\\
455 - He just walked in and played the
piano,\\
456 - and I got the idea.\\
457 - Every little breeze\\
458 - Seems to whisper Louise...\\
459 - Uh, you're in the right place.\\
460 - Uh, you remember my husband, Mr.
Maurice Ricardo.\\
461 - How do you do?\\
462 - Enchante.\\
463 - And Mr. And Mrs.
Maurice Mertz.\\
464 - Monsieur.\\
465 - Bonjour, bonjour.\\
466 - Bonjou...
Ah, Monsieur Ricardo,\\
467 - your wife say I may speak to you\\
468 - about appearing at your club.\\
469 - Well, uh, yes, we'd be happy to give
you an audition.\\
470 - Could you come over tomorrow
afternoon about 4:00?\\
471 - Certainement, I will be there.\\
472 - Merci.\\
473 - Merci, madame, merci, monsieur.
Merci, merci.\\
474 - Au revoir.
Au revoir.\\
475 - Every little breeze seems to...\\
476 - Bonjour.\\
477 - Hey, you know, this idea of so many
Chevaliers\\
478 - might be very funny.\\
479 - We could all be in the same thing.\\
480 - We could all wear the same costume.\\
481 - We could sing\\
482 - Every little breeze...\\
483 - Lucy!\\
484 - What?\\
485 - You don't seem to understand\\
486 - that I don't want you in the show.\\
487 - Listen, Ricky, this whole French
revue idea is mine,\\
488 - and if I can't be in it, you can't
use it.\\
489 - Okay, sue me.\\
490 - Look, honey, you know I'll manage to
sneak in anyway,\\
491 - so why don't you let me be in it\\
492 - right from the beginning?\\
493 - Come on, Ricky, you'll save yourself
a lot of trouble.\\
494 - I'm going to save us all a lot of
trouble.\\
495 - I'm going to give orders down at the
club\\
496 - that you're not going to be allowed
in there for any reason at all.\\
497 - You're not even going to be allowed\\
498 - to get into the building.\\
499 - That'll take care of you.\\
500 - Oh, yeah?\\
501 - Yeah.\\
502 - I'll just bet you I can get in
anyway.\\
503 - You want to lose a little more money,
eh?\\
504 - How much would you like to bet?\\
505 - You name it, buster.\\
506 - $20?\\
507 - Not very sure of yourself, are you?\\
508 - $30?\\
509 - Piker.\\
510 - 50 bucks?\\
511 - You got yourself a bet.\\
512 - Okay.
Okay.\\
513 - Every little breeze seems to whisper
Louise\\
514 - The birds in the trees...\\
515 - Let's take the dance.\\
516 - We're going to rehearse that music in
there.\\
517 - One...\\

5 - Oh, really? He's the nicest, dearest,
sweetest husband\\
6 - in the whole world.\\
7 - Oh, naturally, it was very expensive,\\

29 - (chuckling)\\
30 - I wish you wouldn't make such a big
point\\
31 - about how expensive it's gonna be.\\
32 - After all, I'm getting it wholesale.\\
33 - Shh! No one's supposed to know that\\
34 - but you, me and the minks.\\
35 - What's the difference who knows?\\
36 - I want people to think\\

get it.\\

154 - Sorry I kicked you so hard.\\
155 - That was kind of stupid of me,
especially right now, huh?\\
156 - You're not mad, are you?\\
157 - My father always said to me,\\
158 - "El que le da de comer al padre ajeno\\
159 - pierde la mano y pierde el pan."\\
160 - What does that mean?\\
161 - Don't kick the shin that stoles you.\\
162 - Oh!\\
163 - Oh.\\
164 - You're cute!\\
165 - Here we go!\\
166 - We say good night to Daddy.\\
167 - Say good night to Daddy.\\
168 - Good night, boy.\\
169 - Say good night.\\
170 - Say, "Good night, Daddy."\\
171 - Say, "Good..." Oh, come on, say good
night to Daddy.\\
172 - Oh...\\
173 - Well, honey, I guess he's just tired.\\
174 - Sure, he's tired, Mama.\\
175 - Yeah, you should have seen him today.\\
176 - He was all over the place.\\
177 - Really?\\
178 - Yeah. Want to walk a little bit for
Daddy?\\
179 - Oh, come on. Show me how you can
walk.
Here, take this.\\
180 - Here, boy.
Come on, show Daddy how you can walk.\\
181 - Here, come on over here.\\
182 - Come on to Daddy.\\
183 - Come on. Come on.\\
184 - Oh! Isn't that wonderful?\\
185 - Look at that boy.\\
186 - Oh, that's wonderful!\\
187 - Oh, that's wonderful, man.\\
188 - Come on. Say, "Nighty night, Poppy."\\
189 - He's a big boy.\\
190 - Yeah. Say nighty night.\\
191 - Good night, Ricky.\\
192 - Here, honey.\\
193 - There we are.
Say good night.\\
194 - Good night.\\
195 - Wave bye-bye to Poppy.\\
196 - Good night, sweetheart.\\
197 - Wave bye-bye.
Wave bye-bye.\\
198 - He's sleepy, Mommy.\\
199 - Yeah, good night.\\
200 - Good night, boy.\\
201 - (chuckling)\\
202 - Well, our little man is sound asleep.\\
203 - Good. When's Mrs. Trumbull gonna get
here?\\
204 - Any minute.\\
205 - You know, I always think\\
206 - it's so silly to have to get a
baby-sitter\\
207 - to go across the hall to the Mertzes'
to play canasta.\\
208 - Well, the price is right:\\
209 - Nothing an hour, double for overtime.\\
210 - Well, I guess it gives her something
to do.\\
211 - Yeah.
(phone rings)\\
212 - She's an awfully nice woman.\\
213 - Yeah.\\
214 - Hello?\\
215 - Oh, hi, Ethel.\\
216 - Sure. What's on your mind?\\
217 - Honey, we're gonna be there in a
minute.\\
218 - Shh!
Why don't you talk then?\\
219 - Oh, well, yes, honey,\\
220 - it's your turn to have the club
meeting this week.\\
221 - Well, I don't know, Ethel.\\
222 - The last two times it was your turn,
I had it here.\\
223 - Now, you can't have the club meeting
here.\\
224 - Shh, be quiet!\\
225 - Well, besides, if I have it here,\\
226 - what excuse have I got to wear my
mink stole?\\
227 - No, I can't leave all the windows
open.\\
228 - Oh, I know, I know.\\
229 - Well, maybe\\
230 - I can have it here.\\
231 - No, you can't have it here.\\
232 - Will you please be quiet?\\
233 - Uh, yes, dear, I understand.\\
234 - Lucy, I want to talk to you for a
minute!\\
235 - Shh!\\
236 - Uh, all right, dear.\\
237 - Uh, okay, I'll have it here. All
right.\\
238 - What's the matter with you?\\
239 - You crazy or something?\\
240 - I told you, you can't have that
meeting here.\\
241 - I'm sorry, Ricky, but don't you know
why Ethel never wants\\
242 - to have the meeting at her place?\\
243 - Sure. She's smart; she doesn't want
to go through that mess.\\
244 - No. Because she's ashamed of her
apartment.\\
245 - She's ashamed of her apartment?\\
246 - Yes.
Why?\\
247 - Well, you know, the wallpaper is all
stained\\
248 - and the furniture is so crummy.\\
249 - Well, I'm sorry, but you can't have
that meeting here.\\
250 - Marco is coming over Thursday.\\
251 - We're gonna work on arrangements all
day long.\\
252 - Now, you certainly can change that.\\
253 - Besides, every time you have that
meeting here,\\
254 - it takes you two days to get ready
for it,\\
255 - two days to get over it,\\
256 - and the place is a mess while they're
here.\\
257 - It'd be simpler to paint the Mertzes'
apartment.\\
258 - Hey, that's a wonderful idea!\\
259 - What?\\
260 - Paint the Mertzes' apartment.\\
261 - Now, wait a minute.
I didn't mean that lirally.\\
262 - Well, I'm taking it lirally.\\
263 - That is a sensational idea.\\
264 - We'll have a painting party.\\
265 - The four of us will paint the
Mertzes' apartment.\\
266 - We're not going to do any such thing.\\
267 - Why not?\\
268 - Look, Fred knows how to paint;\\
269 - it's his apartment;\\
270 - if he wants to fix it up, let him do
it.\\
271 - My father always says,\\
272 - "No te mete en adonde no te llaman."\\
273 - What does that mean?\\
274 - Don't meddle in other people's
business.\\
275 - What did your father ever do\\
276 - but sit around and think up corny
sayings?\\
277 - Besides, it's not meddling.\\
278 - If they don't want it painted, they
can say so.\\
279 - And if they do, you certainly can
spend one afternoon\\
280 - helping our dearest, closest friends,
can't you?\\
281 - Well...\\
282 - Then you will?\\
283 - Okay, but...\\
284 - All right, I'll go get Mrs. Trumbull.\\
285 - I'll tell her to hurry,\\
286 - then we'll go right over and tell
them.\\
287 - ETHEL: I'm lily of the valley\\
288 - Of the quiet, peaceful valley over
there\\
289 - And I'm lonely, oh, so lonely...\\
290 - Fred, Lucy and Ricky will be here in
a minute.\\
291 - That's good.\\
292 - Well, go change.\\
293 - Change?\\
294 - Well, you don't expect to stay
dressed like that, do you?\\
295 - Well, from the tone of your voice,\\
296 - I guess I don't.\\
297 - Go on, get fixed up.\\
298 - (groans)\\
299 - It's only the Ricardos.\\
300 - It's the principle of the thing. Go
on!\\
301 - And put on a necktie.\\
302 - Necktie?\\
303 - Yes, a necktie.\\
304 - (mutters): Necktie? I know, I know.\\
305 - Ricardos are coming over, I got to
get a necktie on.\\
306 - (knock at door)\\
307 - Come in, come in.\\
308 - Hi, girl.
Hi.\\
309 - Hi, Ethel!\\
310 - Where's Fred?
Where's Fred?\\
311 - He'll be right out in a minute.\\
312 - He's showering and dressing.\\
313 - Fred Mertz!\\
314 - Well, you didn't have to get\\
315 - all dressed up just for us.\\
316 - Fred Mertz, you march right back in
there...\\
317 - No. Now, wait a minute.
I have something to tell you.\\
318 - What?
Well...
Come here, Fred.\\
319 - LUCY: Um...\\
320 - Ethel, you know how your apartment
is.\\
321 - What do you mean?\\
322 - Well, the way it looks.\\
323 - Let's face it, it's sort of, uh...\\
324 - Oh, what's the word I'm looking for?\\
325 - I don't use that kind of language.\\
326 - Yeah, well, Ricky and I thought\\
327 - it might be fun to have a painting
party.\\
328 - The four of us could paint your
apartment.\\
329 - A painting party?\\
330 - Yes.\\
331 - And paint this apartment?
Yeah.\\
332 - Oh, that's a wonderful idea.\\
333 - Well, wh-wh-what color do you think
it ought to be?\\
334 - Oh, let's see...\\
335 - Who's gonna pay for the paint?\\
336 - Well, there goes that idea.\\
337 - Let's play canasta.\\
338 - Well, those are things you got to
find out.\\
339 - How ungrateful can you be!\\
340 - I wouldn't be surprised\\
341 - if they called the whole thing off
now.\\
342 - Why?\\
343 - Because you just don't ask questions
like that.\\
344 - When they offer to give us a party,\\
345 - that obviously means that they supply
everything.\\
346 - That is, unless they've changed their
minds after your rudeness.\\
347 - Have you?\\
348 - Uh...\\
349 - No, we-we-we haven't, have we, Ricky?\\
350 - No, no, no...\\
351 - Oh, that's great!\\
352 - That is a good idea, you know.\\
353 - That's the best idea you've ever had,
Lucy.\\
354 - Let's see now, when we paint it,\\
355 - we ought to paint it some, uh...\\
356 - Oh, uh, real...
some real bright color.\\
357 - That's what it needs, a real bright
color.\\
358 - Orange would be nice.\\
359 - Orange! 	    Orange!\\
360 - Oh, don't be so silly.
For heaven's sake.\\
361 - Then, after it's painted,\\
362 - all we'll have to do is buy new
furniture\\
363 - and we'll have a whole\\
364 - completely redecorated apartment.\\
365 - Wait a minute. Wait a minute.\\
366 - What's this about new furniture?\\
367 - Well, after it's painted,\\
368 - we can't leave this ratty stuff in
here.\\
369 - It'll just show it up.\\
370 - Sure.\\
371 - Now, just a minute.\\
372 - You're not gonna touch this chair.\\
373 - You're not gonna touch that lamp.\\
374 - (rattling)\\
375 - Oh, no, let's don't lose that lamp.\\
376 - No. You're not gonna touch that table\\
377 - or that chair he's sitting in either.\\
378 - Well, that only leaves the ashtrays.\\
379 - Well, I don't care.\\
380 - I-I just got this stuff broken in so
it's comfortable.\\
381 - Oh...!\\
382 - How can you say that, Fred?\\
383 - Look at that chair.\\
384 - It's all lumpy and sags in the wrong
places.\\
385 - So does Fred.\\
386 - Never mind!\\
387 - Well, if we're not gonna get new
furniture,\\
388 - you can just forget all about the
painting.\\
389 - Okay.
Okay.\\
390 - Okay, come on, let's play canasta.\\
391 - LUCY: No, no. Now, now, you listen,
Fred.\\
392 - Now you listen.\\
393 - You're not gonna touch this
furniture.\\
394 - It's all stuffed with feathers.
Every bit of it.\\
395 - Why-why, they don't make furniture
like this anymore.\\
396 - You can say that again.\\
397 - Well, I've lived in this miserable
rat's nest\\
398 - for 20 years.\\
399 - I guess I can live in it for 20 more.\\
400 - Oh, now, Ethel, we'll think of
something.\\
401 - I know.\\
402 - How about...?\\
403 - How about you butting out for a
change?\\
404 - Well!\\
405 - Aw, now, don't cry, honey bunch.\\
406 - Don't you "honey bunch" me,\\
407 - you penny-pinching old goat!\\
408 - Who's a penny-pinching old goat?\\
409 - If the penny fits, pinch it!\\
410 - Okay!\\
411 - Que lo estoy diciendo por 13 anos que
no te mete en...\\
412 - They're still not speaking.\\
413 - And the craziest thing of all--\\
414 - they're both mad at me.\\
415 - No!\\
416 - I just can't understand people.\\
417 - Try to help them and they turn on you
every time.\\
418 - Well, I...\\
419 - And don't say, "I told you so."\\
420 - Well, I did told you so.\\
421 - I know, I know.\\
422 - You told me, your father told me,
everybody told me.\\
423 - Why don't you admit that you were
wrong\\
424 - to go there and butt in?\\
425 - All right, I admit it-- I made a
boo-boo.\\
426 - From now on, whatever they do is
their own business.\\
427 - I've learned my lesson.
I'm through.\\
428 - Good.\\
429 - (sighs)\\
430 - Boy, this is a tough one.\\
431 - What is?\\
432 - Trying to figure out\\
433 - how to get Fred and Ethel back
together again.\\
434 - I give up.\\
435 - What's the matter?\\
436 - What were we just talking about?\\
437 - And now you're getting ready to butt
in again.\\
438 - Just butt out, will you?\\
439 - I can't go through life\\
440 - with a boo-boo on my record.\\
441 - Besides, they're our dearest friends,\\
442 - and it's our fault that they're
fighting.\\
443 - Our fault?
Well, my fault.\\
444 - And I know how to straighten it out,
too.\\
445 - Well, I'm not gonna listen.\\
446 - Well, I'm gonna say it anyway.\\
447 - Where's that magazine?\\
448 - You see, if we do the painting and
don't get the furniture,\\
449 - Ethel will be mad.\\
450 - If we do get the furniture, Fred will
be mad.\\
451 - So, there's just one thing to do--\\
452 - paint the furniture and upholster the
old furniture.\\
453 - Did you hear me?\\
454 - "Paint the furniture and upholster
the old furniture"?\\
455 - Yes.\\
456 - You mean paint the apartment\\
457 - and upholster the old furniture?\\
458 - Yes.
I didn't hear you.\\
459 - Oh...\\
460 - Now, look, I don't mean\\
461 - that we're going to have it done.\\
462 - We're going to do it ourselves.\\
463 - Do it ourselves?\\
464 - Sure, there's an article in here;
it's easy.\\
465 - Look. Here it is.\\
466 - Now look at this.\\
467 - Right here.\\
468 - Who's going to pay for the material?\\
469 - You sound more like Fred Mertz every
day.\\
470 - Now, look, Ricky, we've just got to
do it.\\
471 - We'll pay for the material.\\
472 - Okay, but that means that your mink
stole\\
473 - is going to be cut from here to here.\\
474 - All right, if that's the way it has
to be.\\
475 - Come on.\\
476 - But that's certainly hitting below\\
477 - where my mink belt used to be.\\
478 - (knock at door)\\
479 - Come in.\\
480 - Hello, Fred.\\
481 - Oh, it's you.\\
482 - What's that you're eating?\\
483 - My breakfast.\\
484 - A bottle of beer and a salami
sandwich?\\
485 - Well, it's the only thing I know how
to cook.\\
486 - Ethel has locked herself\\
487 - in the bedroom and won't come out.\\
488 - Well, that's why we're here, Fred.\\
489 - I have a plan that'll fix everything.\\
490 - Please, from now on,\\
491 - your channel doesn't come in on my
set.\\
492 - He'll listen to you, Ricky.\\
493 - You tell him I have a wonderful plan\\
494 - that won't cost him a cent.\\
495 - My scatterbrained wife has another
half-witted scheme,\\
496 - and if you listen to it, you're out
of your mind.\\
497 - Boy, did I suffer in that
translation.\\
498 - Well, what's the plan?\\
499 - I want to tell you both together.\\
500 - Did you lose something?\\
501 - No, I didn't lose something.\\
502 - What's your plan?\\
503 - Well, we thought that we would paint
the apartment\\
504 - and upholster the furniture
ourselves.\\
505 - We'd leave in all the lumps and sags\\
506 - and that way, everybody would be
happy.\\
507 - Hey, that's a good idea, isn't it,
sweetie?\\
508 - That sounds fine, honey bunch.\\
509 - There's an article in Better Homes
and Gardens\\
510 - here I want to show you.\\
511 - I know how to do it.
Who's going to buy the material?\\
512 - Okay, we'll buy the material.\\
513 - Let's not...\\
514 - (sighs)\\
515 - Well, I'm all through with my wall.\\
516 - Oh, isn't it beautiful?\\
517 - Hey, that didn't take very long at
all, did it?\\
518 - Uh-uh.
Well, not a bad job for a bunch of
amateurs.\\
519 - How are you doing, Lucy?\\
520 - Fine. I just got this little corner
here.\\
521 - RICKY: That's good. Uh-oh!\\
522 - You missed a little spot right here.\\
523 - LUCY: Oh?\\
524 - ETHEL: Oh, Ricky, you did a swell job
on that woodwork.\\
525 - Lucy!\\
526 - What?\\
527 - Oh, Fred, I'm sorry.\\
528 - Oh, thank you, Lucy.\\
529 - That's the most hair he's had on his
head for 30 years.\\
530 - Oh, I'm sorry, Fred.\\
531 - (laughing:)
Here, Fred.\\
532 - You know, actually, we did pretty
good\\
533 - not getting a lot of paint all over
us.\\
534 - Most people would have had paint all
over them.\\
535 - Sure.
Yeah, I'll say.\\
536 - Oh, Lucy.\\
537 - Well, so I'm enthusiastic.\\
538 - But look at that paint job.\\
539 - Isn't that a dilly?\\
540 - I'll say, but I was right.\\
541 - LUCY: What?\\
542 - The furniture looks worse.\\
543 - Well, we're getting to that now.\\
544 - That's next, the upholstering.\\
545 - Are you sure you know what you're
doing?\\
546 - Sure. We painted ourselves, didn't
we?\\
547 - Well, you did, anyway.\\
548 - You know what I meant.\\
549 - Go down...
in the apartment\\
550 - and get that material.
It's on the desk.\\
551 - Okay.\\
552 - Let me at this stale old chair.\\
553 - I've been waiting for this.\\
554 - Oh, no!\\
555 - I can't stand to look at this.\\
556 - It seems just like an old friend.\\
557 - Oh, keep quiet, Fred.\\
558 - (grunting): Aa-ah!\\
559 - (whimpering)\\
560 - Tell me, did it suffer much?\\
561 - Oh... come on, do something useful.\\
562 - Go open the window.\\
563 - The paint smells awful in here.\\
564 - All right.\\
565 - I can't stand the smell of paint.\\
566 - Hey, Fred, go get that electric fan
we used last summer.\\
567 - That'll clear all this paint smell
out.\\
568 - All right.\\
569 - Now, don't plug it in here.\\
570 - It's still wet there.\\
571 - Well, I'll get a longer cord\\
572 - and plug it in the kitchen.\\
573 - What's the matter with that?\\
574 - Boy, he wasn't kidding about these
feathers, was he?\\
575 - Oh, Lucy, be awful careful.\\
576 - They're just murder to sweep up.\\
577 - I know. I got to put them all up
here.\\
578 - Can I help you get that out of there?\\
579 - Yeah, you do that.\\
580 - Okay.\\
581 - (grunting)\\
582 - Aah... ooh...
Oh, this tired old chair.\\
583 - Am I glad to get this eyesore out of
here!\\
584 - Aah!\\
585 - There.\\
586 - We got to get these tacks out of
here, you know?\\
587 - How do you do that?\\
588 - With a screwdriver.\\
589 - Oh, okay.\\
590 - And you be careful 'cause we have to
use them again.\\
591 - All right.\\
592 - There, this ought to work fine.\\
593 - Uh-oh, it must have caught on
something.\\
594 - This will do it all right, though.\\
595 - Fred!\\
596 - Fred!\\
597 - Fred!\\
598 - Fred!\\
599 - Fred!\\
600 - Fred!
Go pull out the plug!\\
601 - Fred!
Oh, my God,\\
602 - look at the place.\\
603 - Oh, Fred!
Oh, no, look...\\
604 - What happened?\\
605 - Oh...\\
606 - What happened?!\\
607 - Lucy, now look at the mess you made!\\
608 - You've ruined our whole apartment!\\
609 - I have?\\
610 - Yes, you, this was your idea.\\
611 - Now what are you going to do about
it?\\
612 - Hi, girl.\\
613 - Hi.\\
614 - Oh, boy doesn't our furniture\\
615 - look wonderful in here!\\
616 - Uh-huh.\\
617 - It was kind of rough on you and Ricky\\
618 - having to pay for all this,\\
619 - but I'm glad the way it turned out.\\
620 - So am I, in a way.\\
621 - You see, you got our old furniture,\\
622 - but I got to buy new furniture for
our apartment.\\
623 - And I get to hold the club meeting\\
624 - in my own, wonderful, newly furnished
apartment!\\
625 - Yeah. My stuff came; you want to see
it?\\
626 - Mm-hmm.
Come on.\\
627 - Okay.\\
628 - There it is.\\
629 - (gasps)\\
630 - Isn't it beautiful?\\
631 - Oh, Lucy, isn't that wonderful!\\
632 - I think it's dreamy.\\
633 - Oh!\\
634 - Oh, everything turned out just
wonderful--\\
635 - everything except...\\
636 - Except what?\\
637 - Well, I've been kind of afraid to ask
you,\\
638 - but what happened to your mink stole?\\
639 - We're sitting on it.\\

19 - Mrs. Ricardo, did you see anyone?\\
20 - No. I was asleep.\\
21 - Who else lives here?\\
22 - Well, my-my husband-- he's still
working at the club,\\
23 - but my little baby is asleep in the
nursery.\\
24 - I'll check the premises.\\
25 - Oh! Oh, a robbery right here,\\
26 - right here in the building?\\
27 - Oh, it just gives me goose pimples!\\
28 - Well, gee, at least you've got Fred
to protect you.\\
29 - Protect me?\\
30 - The minute he heard about it, he ran
and hid.\\
31 - I was not hiding.\\
32 - I was looking for something to hit
him with!\\
33 - Under the bed?\\
34 - Ooh, it was awful.\\
35 - Lucy, I can't see wh-why you didn't
wake up.\\
36 - Officer, please don't wake up the
baby.\\
37 - Where was the robbery?\\
38 - Well, let's see now...\\
39 - (all talking excitedly at once)\\
40 - Ethel, where was it?\\
41 - It was in the Ackermans' apartment
across the street.\\
42 - No kidding?\\
43 - Yeah, and then they saw him run
across the street\\
44 - and right into this building!\\
45 - Are you sure?\\
46 - Oh, yes.\\
47 - We've checked everywhere.\\
48 - So I guess she's given us the slip
again.\\
49 - Oh, that's too... She?
She?\\
50 - Isn't it a man?\\
51 - We think the person who's been
pulling all these jobs\\
52 - in the neighborhood lately is a
woman.\\
53 - Oh, gracious alive!\\
54 - What makes you think it's a woman?\\
55 - We suspected it at first,\\
56 - but tonight the Ackermans' report
clinched it.\\
57 - How?	How?	How?\\
58 - Just before entering this building,\\
59 - they saw the robber stop\\
60 - and take a hitch at her girdle.\\
61 - Oh!\\
62 - Have you any idea who she is?\\
63 - No. The only thing we've got to go on
are fingerprints,\\
64 - but the boys on the force call her
"Madame X."\\
65 - Madame X.
Madame X.\\
66 - Oh, it gives me shivers.\\
67 - How do you like that?\\
68 - Well, uh, uh, thanks, folks, for your
cooperation.\\
69 - Oh, well, thank you, officer.\\
70 - (excited chatter)\\
71 - Look at that.
"Madame X strikes again.\\
72 - "The mysterious woman burglar added
another\\
73 - to her long list of robberies last
night."\\
74 - Oh, boy, that's exciting.\\
75 - It isn't every day we have a robbery\\
76 - and get our names in the paper.\\
77 - What do you mean "our names in the
paper?\\
78 - Right here: "The police questioned
all the tenants."\\
79 - That's us.\\
80 - I'll cut it out and put it in my
scrapbook.\\
81 - Well, it is exciting.\\
82 - Have you seen the News?\\
83 - Have you seen the...
the Mirror?\\
84 - Look at that.\\
85 - Oh! Oh, the News is more sensational.\\
86 - Yeah, but the Mirror gives it more
space.\\
87 - Isn't it scary?\\
88 - Fred Mertz, I want you to have new
locks\\
89 - put on every door in this building.\\
90 - A child could open the old ones.\\
91 - I can't afford it.\\
92 - I'll buy them.\\
93 - With what?\\
94 - Oh, I've managed to save a little\\
95 - out of that miserable pittance you
give me.\\
96 - Okay, then, buy the locks.\\
97 - All right.\\
98 - I was going to buy you a birthday
present\\
99 - with that money.\\
100 - Oh, fine.\\
101 - Oh, Fred, I didn't know you had a
birthday coming up.\\
102 - When is it, Fred?\\
103 - A week from Thursday.
Ah.\\
104 - How old are you gonna be?\\
105 - Did you hear about the big robbery
last night?\\
106 - Come on, Fred, don't be bashful.\\
107 - How old are you?\\
108 - Well, now, I'll make a deal.\\
109 - I'll tell how old I am\\
110 - if you'll tell how old you are.\\
111 - That was a big robbery we had last
night.\\
112 - Come on, birthday boy.\\
113 - Let's go count how many locks we have
to buy.\\
114 - New door locks for Fred\\
115 - New door locks for Fred\\
116 - New door locks for...\\
117 - (chuckling)\\
118 - Gee, I'm glad we found out about
Fred's birthday.\\
119 - What will we get him?\\
120 - How about some keys to go with the
locks?\\
121 - Seriously, we have to get him
something nice.\\
122 - Hey, I know!\\
123 - A tweet soot.\\
124 - A "tweet soot"?\\
125 - Yeah. He's always wanted a soot from
my tailor's--\\
126 - a tweet one.\\
127 - Oh, a tweed suit!\\
128 - Oh, he'd love that.\\
129 - Well, I tell you what.\\
130 - I'll make an appointment for him\\
131 - to go to the tailor's today.\\
132 - Oh, no, that's no fun.\\
133 - Then it won't be a surprise.\\
134 - Well, honey, they have to know his
measurements.\\
135 - They do?\\
136 - They do unless you want to give him\\
137 - a tweet nightshirt.\\
138 - Oh, dear.\\
139 - Let's see...\\
140 - Oh, why don't you get one of his old
suits from Ethel,\\
141 - and then the tailors can get the
measurements off of that.\\
142 - No, she's such a blabbermouth, she'd
tell him.\\
143 - Well, I don't know how you're gonna
get it, then.\\
144 - I know. I'll sneak in and get one of
his old suits\\
145 - out of the closet without either one
of them knowing it.\\
146 - Be sure they don't catch you.\\
147 - Well, I won't if you keep them busy.\\
148 - Call them up and get them over here
on some pretext.\\
149 - Okay. I'll get them over on some
pretext.\\
150 - What's a pretext?\\
151 - Well, it's when you want someone to
do something,\\
152 - but you don't want them to know\\
153 - that you want them to do that
particular something.\\
154 - So, you make up something else,\\
155 - then they think they're doing
something else,\\
156 - but in reality, they're doing the
something\\
157 - that you want them to do\\
158 - but don't want them to know that you
want them to do.\\
159 - What?!\\
160 - Look, I'll show you what I mean.\\
161 - Oh, wait a minute.
Forget the pretext.\\
162 - They're out around the building
counting locks.\\
163 - I'll go get it right now.\\
164 - Okay.\\
165 - (humming tune)\\
166 - (door buzzer sounds)\\
167 - (humming)\\
168 - Oh, hello, Mrs. Trumbull.\\
169 - Uh, Mrs. Mertz, here is the check for
my rent.\\
170 - Oh, thanks.\\
171 - My, we certainly had a lot of
excitement\\
172 - around here last night, didn't we?\\
173 - I'll say we did.\\
174 - Are we alone?\\
175 - Well, yes.\\
176 - Fred is out in the kitchen, but he
can't hear us.\\
177 - Why?\\
178 - Mrs. Mertz, I know something.\\
179 - About the robbery?\\
180 - Yes.\\
181 - And I've got to tell somebody.\\
182 - Oh, you can trust me, Mrs. Trumbull!\\
183 - Well, I...
I may be wrong,\\
184 - but I think there's a chance that
Madame X\\
185 - may be somebody who lives in our
building.\\
186 - In this building?!\\
187 - Shh!\\
188 - What makes you think so?\\
189 - Well, they say Madame X is a woman\\
190 - who wears men's clothes.\\
191 - Yes, yes.\\
192 - They saw her come in here\\
193 - and they didn't see her go out.\\
194 - Yes.
Now, I know I'm wrong.\\
195 - I know there's a logical explanation,
but...\\
196 - But what?! But what?!\\
197 - Well, I-I know I'm wrong, but I...
I...\\
198 - I saw someone sneaking out of your
apartment\\
199 - with a man's suit.\\
200 - Who?\\
201 - Lucy Ricardo.\\
202 - Lucy?\\
203 - Going out of this apartment?\\
204 - Sneaking along the hall.\\
205 - Oh, my goodness!\\
206 - Lucy!\\
207 - Oh, Mrs. Trum...\\
208 - Oh, what are we saying?\\
209 - I know there's a logical explanation,
but what is it?\\
210 - Oh, Mrs. Trumbull, I'm surprised at
you.\\
211 - Suspecting Lucy of all people.\\
212 - Well, I said I knew I was wrong.\\
213 - Well, I should say so.\\
214 - Oh, I'm ashamed of the two of us\\
215 - just standing here talking like this.\\
216 - Well, so am I.\\
217 - Just forget I ever mentioned it.\\
218 - Oh, consider it forgotten.\\
219 - Good-bye.\\
220 - Good-bye.\\
221 - Fred! Fred! Fred! Fred!\\
222 - Fred, come here!\\
223 - Come here!
What's the matter?\\
224 - Guess who Madame X is!\\
225 - Who?\\
226 - Lucy!\\
227 - Lucy who?\\
228 - Lucy Ricardo.\\
229 - And what's more, she's pulling all
those jobs\\
230 - wearing your suit!\\
231 - I've been waiting for this.\\
232 - Your brain has gone bye-bye.\\
233 - Oh, is that so?\\
234 - Now, Mrs. Trumbull said\\
235 - she saw Lucy sneaking out of this
apartment\\
236 - carrying one of your suits!\\
237 - I don't believe it.\\
238 - Well, I'll just look and see.\\
239 - Aha!\\
240 - Your gray suit is gone.\\
241 - So she took one of my suits.\\
242 - Ethel, there's a hundred reasons\\
243 - why Lucy could take one of my suits.\\
244 - Name a few.\\
245 - Well, it could have been bec...\\
246 - Well, she might have had a...\\
247 - So Lucy is Madame X!\\
248 - Uh-huh.\\
249 - Now, listen, we got to get ahold of
ourselves.\\
250 - We're standing here, accusing Lucy of
being a crook!\\
251 - I know it, I know it.\\
252 - We've got to prove that Lucy is
innocent\\
253 - for her sake and ours.\\
254 - But how?\\
255 - I know!\\
256 - After Ricky goes to work tonight,\\
257 - we'll watch her and see what she
does.\\
258 - We'll go up on the roof and come down
the fire escape\\
259 - and watch her through the window.\\
260 - What will that prove?\\
261 - Well, if she doesn't put on your suit\\
262 - and go out and come back later\\
263 - with a bag full of loot, then she
isn't Madame X.\\
264 - That won't prove anything.\\
265 - Even a crook has a night off.\\
266 - Then we'll stay out there till we
prove\\
267 - that Lucy is innocent.\\
268 - All right.\\
269 - Besides...\\
270 - if she is Madame X,\\
271 - you and I better know about it.\\
272 - Yeah.\\
273 - What's she doing now?\\
274 - She must be going to crack a safe
tonight.\\
275 - She's sandpapering the ends of her
fingers.\\
276 - Are you sure?\\
277 - Yeah.\\
278 - I was wrong.\\
279 - She's using an emery board on her
nails.\\
280 - Come on, Sherlock,\\
281 - let's go back to headquarters and
forget it.\\
282 - Forget it? We've only been here an
hour.\\
283 - I'm cold, I want to go home.\\
284 - Well, go ahead.\\
285 - Leave me your coat, will you?\\
286 - (sneezes)\\
287 - Say, you are getting cold,\\
288 - sneezing like...\\
289 - Here, put this on.\\
290 - Put my hat on, too.\\
291 - Now, don't hang around here too long!\\
292 - I won't. Just long enough to clear
the name\\
293 - of my good friend, Madame X...\\
294 - Uh, Lucy.\\
295 - (sneezes loudly)\\
296 - I'm sorry to wake you up, honey.\\
297 - I'm going to take you over to Aunt
Ethel's.\\
298 - That might have been Madame X on the
fire escape.\\
299 - (door shuts)\\
300 - There she is.\\
301 - I don't believe it.\\
302 - Your Aunt Ethel is Madame X!\\
303 - (sighs)\\
304 - Here's your house money for the week,
honey.\\
305 - Now put it away.
Don't lose it.\\
306 - Now, look, Lucy, you've got to stop
even thinking\\
307 - that Ethel is Madame X.\\
308 - I know, but after what I saw...\\
309 - What was she doing out there on that
fire escape\\
310 - wearing a man's hat and coat?\\
311 - Well, there must be a good reason for
it.\\
312 - I'd like nothing better than to find
a good reason.\\
313 - I've been thinking and thinking and I
can't find one.\\
314 - Well, now, you don't really think
that Ethel is Madame X?\\
315 - Of course not, but how can I prove
it?\\
316 - Well, why don't you just ask her
about it?\\
317 - Oh, sure.
What am I gonna say?\\
318 - "Hi, Ethel, robbed any good
apartments lately?"\\
319 - You know what I mean.\\
320 - Tell her that you saw her out on the
fire escape.\\
321 - Oh, I can't do that.\\
322 - Why not?\\
323 - If she's not Madame X,\\
324 - she'll tell why she was out there.\\
325 - And if she is, she'll shoot me.\\
326 - We got to be clever about this,
Ricky.\\
327 - What do the police do when they
suspect someone?\\
328 - Oh, well, they got a whole routine.\\
329 - What kind of a routine?\\
330 - Well, you know, they got, uh...\\
331 - clues, fingerprints...\\
332 - telltale evidences...\\
333 - Fingerprints!\\
334 - We'll try to get Ethel's fingerprints
on something.\\
335 - This silver cigarette case of yours\\
336 - would be just perfect.\\
337 - Hello, Ethel.\\
338 - Ethel, we were just wondering why we
haven't...\\
339 - Oh, Fred, I didn't recognize your
voice.\\
340 - Oh...\\
341 - How are you?\\
342 - Oh, we're fine.\\
343 - Yeah, well, we were just sitting
around,\\
344 - wondering why you haven't dropped
over lately.\\
345 - Yeah, well, why don't you come over?\\
346 - Oh, good. Bring the madame, uh, the
missus...\\
347 - Uh, Ethel, bring Ethel.\\
348 - Oh, all right, bye.\\
349 - They're coming right over.\\
350 - This will just be perfect.\\
351 - Now, let's see...
we can serve drinks,\\
352 - maybe get fingerprints on the
glasses, too.\\
353 - Okay, I'll make some lemonade or
something.\\
354 - Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.\\
355 - Just serve two drinks.\\
356 - Just two?\\
357 - Yeah. Now, we won't touch a thing.\\
358 - That way, all the fingerprints will
be theirs.\\
359 - Okay.\\
360 - Don't forget now.\\
361 - Now, keep your eyes peeled for clues\\
362 - while we're over there.\\
363 - Hey, if you could get Lucy to choke
you,\\
364 - we'd have her fingerprints on your
neck.\\
365 - Hey, that's a good idea.\\
366 - Yeah, I like it.\\
367 - I don't mean the choking part.\\
368 - We'll try and get her fingerprints on
something.\\
369 - All right.\\
370 - Now, while we're over there, we won't
touch a thing,\\
371 - and any fingerprints will be theirs.\\
372 - All right, come on, let's go.\\
373 - (door buzzer sounds)\\
374 - Hi, Ethel, Fred!
Come on in.\\
375 - Hello, honey.\\
376 - Come in and sit down, won't you?\\
377 - Hi.
Hello, Lucy.\\
378 - LUCY: Good to see you.\\
379 - I bet you were wondering\\
380 - why I asked you over here tonight.\\
381 - Well, yes.\\
382 - Oh...\\
383 - Uh, I have something I want to show
you.\\
384 - What?\\
385 - Here, take it.\\
386 - I can see it.\\
387 - It's that cigarette case\\
388 - that, uh, Ricky got for Christmas
last year.\\
389 - Oh, you've seen it before, huh?\\
390 - Yeah.\\
391 - Oh.\\
392 - You want to see it again?\\
393 - No.\\
394 - Oh.\\
395 - Uh... uh, look inside.\\
396 - You haven't seen the inscription,
have you?\\
397 - You mean the one that says, uh,\\
398 - "Merry Christmas to the boss from the
boys, 1952"?\\
399 - Yeah, that's the one.\\
400 - Yeah, I've seen it.\\
401 - Uh, you know, this is pure silver.\\
402 - Isn't it amazing how heavy silver is?\\
403 - Here, lift it.\\
404 - I know, it weighs a ton.\\
405 - That's the reason Ricky never carries
it.\\
406 - Yeah... yeah.\\
407 - Well...\\
408 - RICKY: Hello, folks!\\
409 - Oh, hi.
Oh, hi, Rick.\\
410 - Put the drinks right down there,
dear.\\
411 - Okay.
Oh, just a minute.\\
412 - Just a minute.
Uh, oh.\\
413 - Okay.\\
414 - There you are.\\
415 - Have one, Fred.\\
416 - No, thanks.\\
417 - Go ahead, help yourself, Ethel.\\
418 - No, thanks, I'm on a diet.\\
419 - Oh, on a diet.
Why, you don't have to reduce.\\
420 - If anything, I'd say you were
underweight.\\
421 - Have you been to an oculist lately?\\
422 - Oh, keep quiet.\\
423 - Come on, Ethel.\\
424 - Have one, come on.\\
425 - Here.\\
426 - No, I'm not thirsty, anyway.\\
427 - Oh...\\
428 - well...\\
429 - Oh, don't let that keep you from
having one, honey.\\
430 - You have one.\\
431 - Oh, all right.\\
432 - Hand it to me, will you, dear?\\
433 - Uh-huh.\\
434 - No, thanks, I changed my mind, I...\\
435 - Uh, oh, uh, let's have some peanuts.\\
436 - Dear, they're right there on the
mantel.\\
437 - Oh, okay.\\
438 - (clears throat)\\
439 - Here.\\
440 - Oh, thanks.\\
441 - I'd like some.\\
442 - All right.\\
443 - Oh, just a minute.\\
444 - Uh, here, hand this to Fred, dear.\\
445 - All right.\\
446 - Thanks.\\
447 - Well, come on, Fred, let's go.\\
448 - All right.\\
449 - Oh, don't go.\\
450 - Oh, honey, I've got a hundred things
to do.\\
451 - LUCY: Oh, that's too bad.
I didn't...\\
452 - Oh, we may come later.\\
453 - We might come up later.\\
454 - Oh, well, I hope so.\\
455 - FRED: Bye-bye. Thanks.\\
456 - Bye.
See you later now, if you can.\\
457 - Darn it!\\
458 - Did you see how slippery she was?\\
459 - She deliberately kept\\
460 - from putting her fingers on anything.\\
461 - Yeah.\\
462 - How about that, huh?\\
463 - Mm...\\
464 - Hmm.\\
465 - How about that?\\
466 - I got them!
I got them!\\
467 - I got her fingerprints!\\
468 - Where did you get them?\\
469 - On that silver cigarette case.\\
470 - Oh, pretty slick, huh?\\
471 - Now, all I got to do is take this
down to the police station\\
472 - and compare these with Madame X's...
Ha, ha!\\
473 - I'll go get my coat on.\\
474 - All right.\\
475 - Fred!\\
476 - Don't touch that cigarette case.\\
477 - I don't want any fingerprints on that
but Lucy's.\\
478 - Now, let's see.\\
479 - I think I got good, clear prints.\\
480 - Hey, she's cleverer than I thought.\\
481 - She handled that with her bare hands\\
482 - and didn't leave a print on it.\\
483 - Yeah, how about that?\\
484 - Honey, I'm late for the club already.
I'll see you later.\\
485 - Ricky, have you got your sil-silver
cigarette case?\\
486 - No. Why?\\
487 - Well, I left it right here someplace,\\
488 - and I just can't underst...\\
489 - Ethel swiped your cigarette case.\\
490 - She really is Madame X.\\
491 - Oh, come on, now.\\
492 - Yes! Now, we got to do something
about this.\\
493 - I don't know what you're gonna do,\\
494 - but I got to go.
Good night, honey.\\
495 - Listen, Ricky, now, I got an idea.\\
496 - I'm gonna call Ethel and I'm gonna
tell her\\
497 - that I'm gonna the baby over to Mrs.
Trumbull's apartment,\\
498 - and then I'm going to the club with
you tonight.\\
499 - Why?\\
500 - Well, that way, she'll think\\
501 - the apartment is empty\\
502 - an-and if she wants to really rob it,
she can.\\
503 - And th-then I'll hide in here,\\
504 - an-and I'll catch her red-handed.\\
505 - And maybe I can talk her out of this
life of crime.\\
506 - Oh, now, look, honey, why don't you
get a good book,\\
507 - go to bed and forget all these crazy
schemes?\\
508 - They're not crazy schemes.\\
509 - Yes, they are.\\
510 - Now, good night, dear.\\
511 - Good night, dear.\\
512 - (door shuts)\\
513 - Hello, Ethel.\\
514 - Uh, Ethel, in case you were thinking\\
515 - of dropping over again tonight,\\
516 - I just wanted you to know that we
wouldn't be home.\\
517 - Ethel, not my good silver!\\
518 - You know that belongs to Ricky's
mother!\\
519 - Put that gun away!\\
520 - Put that away!\\
521 - What do you want to do, hurt
somebody?\\
522 - Now stop that!\\
523 - The i... the idea!\\
524 - I'm surprised at you!\\
525 - Trying to rob our apartment!\\
526 - Why, Ethel Mertz!\\
527 - Why, Ethel Mertz!\\
528 - I have never heard of such a thing
before.\\
529 - You...\\
530 - You should be ashamed of yourself.\\
531 - Ethel, now, you...\\
532 - This is not the life for you.\\
533 - If it's money you need,\\
534 - I'll pay you what I owe you.\\
535 - You give up this life of crime,\\
536 - and I won't tell a soul that you're
Madame X.\\
537 - Lucy.
What?!\\
538 - What's the matter?\\
539 - I got Madame...\\
540 - Whoops!\\
541 - Madame X!\\
542 - Madame X!\\
543 - (screams)
That's Madame X!\\
544 - (Lucy and Ethel shrieking)\\
545 - Oh, Lucy!\\
546 - Oh!
Oh!\\
547 - Oh, Lucy!\\
548 - What's the matter?\\
549 - No, no, it isn't Lucy.\\
550 - The real Madame X got away.\\
551 - Which way did she go?\\
552 - She went that way.\\
553 - This way?
Yeah.\\
554 - Sure?
Yeah.\\
555 - Oh!\\
556 - Ethel, Ethel!\\
557 - Huh?\\
558 - Let go of my neck.\\
559 - Oh.\\
560 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
561 - Oh...\\
562 - Oh, dear.\\
563 - Oh...
Oh, Lucy...\\
564 - I'm so relieved to know that\\
565 - that was the real Madame X and not
you.\\
566 - Me, too.\\
567 - Gee, Ethel, I'm sorry.\\
568 - What do you mean that I wasn't Madame
X?\\
569 - I thought you were.\\
570 - I was?\\
571 - How did you get that idea?\\
572 - Where did you get the idea I was?\\
573 - Mrs. Trumbull says she saw you\\
574 - sneaking out of our apartment,
carrying one of Fred's suits.\\
575 - Oh, that was for a model.\\
576 - Ricky was going to give your Fred a
suit\\
577 - for his birthday.\\
578 - Oh, dear.\\
579 - What were you doing out on our fire
escape,\\
580 - wearing a man's hat and coat?\\
581 - I was spying on you.\\
582 - I thought you were Madame X\\
583 - and Fred and I went out on the fire
escape\\
584 - and I got cold and he gave me his
coat and hat.\\
585 - Oh, no.\\
586 - RICKY: I got her!\\
587 - Honey, I got Ethel!
I got Ethel!\\
588 - Ethel!\\
589 - (clamoring)\\
590 - I got her! I got her, honey!\\
591 - (shouting)\\
592 - (all clamoring)\\
593 - We got her!
I got her! I got her!\\
594 - Did you see how I got her there?\\
595 - Yeah, I saw you.\\
596 - I caught her right there.\\
597 - I caught her myself!\\

\subsection {Episode 10: Changing the Boys' Wardrobe}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Yes, Jerry. Yes, I know.\\
3 - I know it's awful tough to find
publicity these days,\\
4 - but that's what I'm paying you for,
remember?\\
5 - Now, listen to me.\\
6 - I want a story about me in the papers
next week or else.\\
7 - Yes, I got an idea.\\
8 - I got a wonderful idea.\\
9 - How about "Ricky Ricardo Shoots
Publicity Agent"?\\
10 - Okay. Well, look, let's see that it
gets in there, huh?\\
11 - Thanks.\\
12 - Good-bye.\\
13 - Ay, que barbaridad!\\
14 - No se lo que lo pasa a la gente.\\
15 - Se le pago muchisimo dinero para
publicidad\\
16 - y no le hace nada.\\
17 - What's the matter, dear?\\
18 - Oh, that Jerry.\\
19 - You know, when you pay somebody to do
something,\\
20 - you expect them to do it.\\
21 - I practically have to do the whole
thing for him.\\
22 - Now calm down.\\
23 - You'll forget your troubles at the
movies.\\
24 - What are we going to see?\\
25 - Oh, that picture we've been trying to
get to for weeks,\\
26 - with Marilyn Monroe.\\
27 - Yeah, that might make me forget my
troubles.\\
28 - Yeah, well, the Mertzes will be here
any minute.\\
29 - Hurry up.\\
30 - Hurry up and what?\\
31 - Get dressed.\\
32 - I'm dressed.\\
33 - Well, honey, I've been working around
the house all day long.\\
34 - You don't 'spect me to change\\
35 - just to go to a neighborhood movie.\\
36 - Ricky Ricardo, do you mean you'd
actually go to a movie\\
37 - in that awful shirt and those
horrible, old pants?\\
38 - Marilyn won't mind.\\
39 - Besides, this is my best pair of blue
jins.\\
40 - They may be your best blue "jins,"\\
41 - but they're disgraceful.\\
42 - It did.\\
43 - I had an awful time finding it.\\
44 - Must have gotten there by mistake.\\
45 - That was no mistake.\\
46 - I'm not stepping out of this house\\
47 - with you in that outfit.\\
48 - Aw, now, look, honey,\\
49 - if we were going to go dancing or
something,\\
50 - I'd say you had a point,\\
51 - but who's going to see me?\\
52 - We're going to walk two blocks down
to the theater,\\
53 - sit in a dark movie and walk back.\\
54 - Suppose we have an accident.\\
55 - Ay-yi-yi.\\
56 - Suppose a car hits you, and you're
knocked unconscious.\\
57 - You stretched out in those horrible,
old clothes.\\
58 - How's that going to look on the front
page?\\
59 - Oh, brother!\\
60 - Now, look, Lucy...\\
61 - Are you going to change or are we
staying home?\\
62 - Okay, I'll change.\\
63 - Thank you.\\
64 - Boy, the things I do for Marilyn
Monroe.\\
65 - What shall I wear?\\
66 - My tails or my tartan dinner jacket?\\
67 - Just a suit and a tie,\\
68 - and don't be so terribly amusing. Now
go on.\\
69 - Yes, ma'am.\\
70 - Hi.\\
71 - Hi, girl.\\
72 - Where's Fred?\\
73 - He's coming.
Are you ready?\\
74 - Yeah. Ricky will take a few minutes.\\
75 - He's changing his clothes.\\
76 - Honestly, Ethel, you should see the
beat-up old clothes\\
77 - he wanted to wear.\\
78 - You couldn't imagine\\
79 - anybody would want to go out looking
like that.\\
80 - Oh, yes, I could.\\
81 - I don't know how you got Ricky to
change.\\
82 - I couldn't do a thing with Raggedy
Andy.\\
83 - What's the matter with these clothes?\\
84 - They're comfortable.\\
85 - Fred, if you wanted to be
comfortable,\\
86 - I'm surprised you didn't go in your
pajamas and bathrobe.\\
87 - Ah.\\
88 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
89 - Fred, Ricky is wearing a suit, a
shirt and a tie.\\
90 - Now, how are you gonna feel?\\
91 - Comfortable.\\
92 - It's no use, Lucy.\\
93 - You're beating your head against a
stone slob.\\
94 - Yeah.\\
95 - Ricky!\\
96 - RICKY: I'll be there in a minute.\\
97 - Honestly, I don't know what's taking
so long.\\
98 - I guess he's having trouble\\
99 - getting those old jeans off without
breaking them.\\
100 - He's really attached to those pants,
isn't he?\\
101 - Sometimes I think it's vice versa.\\
102 - You know, he doesn't hang them up in
a closet,\\
103 - he stands them up in the corner.\\
104 - RICKY: Okay, I'm ready.\\
105 - Come on, I'll get Mrs. Trumbull.\\
106 - Just a minute!\\
107 - Is he going to go that way?\\
108 - Now, Ricky, it doesn't matter what
Fred does. Come on.\\
109 - Well...\\
110 - Come on, Little Lord Fauntleroy.\\
111 - That does it!\\
112 - LUCY: Now, Ricky!\\
113 - Nobody's going to call me Little
Fraunterooey!\\
114 - Oh...\\
115 - Oh, and wasn't that a wonderful dress\\
116 - she had on in the big number?\\
117 - Oh, yeah.\\
118 - Gee, I hadn't been to movies for so
long,\\
119 - I'd forgotten how fattening they are.\\
120 - Yep, once you start on that popcorn,
you're dead.\\
121 - Too bad they don't make silent
popcorn.\\
122 - I never heard a word of dialogue.\\
123 - Me neither.\\
124 - Any sign of them yet?\\
125 - Yeah, here they come.\\
126 - Are they still doing it?\\
127 - No. They probably stopped\\
128 - the minute we got out of sight.\\
129 - Imagine walking along and poking in
trash cans\\
130 - and shouting, "Any old bones, bottles
or rags!"\\
131 - I... I could just kill those two
sometimes.\\
132 - Well, we started it, walking along
ahead of them,\\
133 - pretending not to know them.\\
134 - Well, they deserved it.\\
135 - Ethel, we are going to have to do
something about this.\\
136 - Now, Lucy,\\
137 - you're not getting another idea, are
you?\\
138 - Yes, I am.\\
139 - How long do you think those two
tramps\\
140 - will go on wearing those old clothes?\\
141 - Until they're condemned by the Board
of Health.\\
142 - Exactly.\\
143 - Or until they're worn so thin\\
144 - that you can see through them\\
145 - and they get arrested.\\
146 - No, we are going to have to save them\\
147 - from that terrible fate\\
148 - and do away with all their old
clothes.\\
149 - Oh, no, Lucy, they'd murder us.\\
150 - It's the only way to keep from going
through life\\
151 - with Rag Pickers, Incorporated.\\
152 - Well, what do we have to do?\\
153 - (laughing hysterically)\\
154 - Oh, you should have seen\\
155 - the look on your face.\\
156 - Well, I didn't expect it.\\
157 - What's the matter?
Did you get arrested for vagrancy?\\
158 - Almost.\\
159 - What?\\
160 - Well, we were standing in the corner,
just talking...\\
161 - And I took my hat off to scratch my
head...\\
162 - And a woman dropped a dime in it.\\
163 - Hi.\\
164 - Hi.\\
165 - How you doing?\\
166 - Fine. You got all of Fred's old
clothes?\\
167 - Yep. I took everything that wasn't
fit to wear\\
168 - out of his closet, and you know what?\\
169 - What?
The closet's empty.\\
170 - (chuckles)\\
171 - Listen, Ricky hasn't thrown anything
away\\
172 - since before he came to this country.\\
173 - You wouldn't believe how old some of
this stuff is.\\
174 - No matter how old it is, Fred's is
older.\\
175 - Oh, no.\\
176 - Look at this.\\
177 - Universidad de la Habana.\\
178 - Well?\\
179 - Ha!\\
180 - You win.\\
181 - Well, I'll call the secondhand man,\\
182 - tell him to come and get this stuff.\\
183 - Lucy, I'm worried.\\
184 - So am I. I'm worried he may refuse
them.\\
185 - No, I don't mean that.\\
186 - Do you think we really ought to do
this?\\
187 - Listen, Ricky's been promising me for
ages\\
188 - he'd get rid of this stuff.\\
189 - Well, so has Fred.\\
190 - Well, we're just helping them\\
191 - keep their promise in a painless sort
of way.\\
192 - Do you think they'll believe our
story?\\
193 - Certainly, it's the best story I ever
made up.\\
194 - Now, what could be more logical?\\
195 - We decided that if they wanted to
wear their old clothes,\\
196 - we would clean them.\\
197 - So, we soaked them in gasoline.\\
198 - They just happened to get a little
close to the stove\\
199 - and burned up.\\
200 - They'd never suspect the truth.\\
201 - Why not?\\
202 - They'd never think we had the nerve\\
203 - to sell their old clothes.\\
204 - I hope you're right.\\
205 - Here's one-- Allen's Used Clothing
Emporium.\\
206 - All right, now I want to take this
number with everything--\\
207 - the spotlight, I want to try the
microphone, the whole works--\\
208 - just like it was tonight.\\
209 - From the top, everybody.\\
210 - (horn intro)\\
211 - (trumpet solo)\\
212 - Granada\\
213 - Tierra sonaba por mi\\
214 - Mi cantar se vuelve gitano cuando es
para ti\\
215 - Mi cantar, hecho de fantasia\\
216 - Mi cantar, lo de la melancolia\\
217 - Que yo te vengo a dar.\\
218 - Granada tierra ensangrentadas en
tardes de toro\\
219 - Mujer que conserva el embrujo de los
ojos moros\\
220 - De sueno rebelde y gitana cubierta de
flores\\
221 - Y beso tu boca de grana\\
222 - Jugosa manzana que me habla de
amor...\\
223 - Granada manola cantada en coplas
preciosas\\
224 - No tengo otra cosa que darte que un
ramo de rosas\\
225 - De rosas de suave fragancia\\
226 - Que le dieran marco a la virgen
morena\\
227 - Granada\\
228 - Tu tierra esta llena de lindas
mujeres\\
229 - De sangre y de sol.\\
230 - OlÃ©!\\
231 - Okay, boys, we'll take the last few
bars in a couple of minutes.\\
232 - (phone rings)
Just take a little rest.\\
233 - Hello.\\
234 - I'd like to speak to Mr. Ricardo,
please.\\
235 - This is Mr. Ricardo.\\
236 - This is Zeb Allen, Allen's Used
Clothes Emporium.\\
237 - Who? What?\\
238 - I thought you might be interested to
know\\
239 - that I just got in a hot shipment of
old clothes.\\
240 - Look, you must have the wrong
Ricardo.\\
241 - This is Ricky Ricardo.\\
242 - I know it.\\
243 - Well, what makes you think\\
244 - that I'd be interested in old
clothes?\\
245 - Because they're yours.\\
246 - What?\\
247 - They're mine?!\\
248 - Yes, sir.
I just came from your house.\\
249 - Your wife was throwing old clothes
out of the front door\\
250 - faster than I could pick them up.\\
251 - Looked like an explosion at the
laundry.\\
252 - I don't believe it.\\
253 - Well, I'll tell you what I've got
here.\\
254 - Here's one plaid flannel shirt--\\
255 - blue and gray, soft and
comfortable-looking\\
256 - and not quite through\\
257 - at the elbows.\\
258 - No.\\
259 - Then there's a sweater here\\
260 - with a big "H" on the front of it\\
261 - and some foreign writing on the back.\\
262 - Oh, no.\\
263 - Now, uh, how would you like to get
these clothes back?\\
264 - Oh, I-I sure would.\\
265 - Now, listen, you'll make\\
266 - a profit on the deal, don't worry.\\
267 - Don't you worry.\\
268 - What?\\
269 - Well, buying men's old clothes from
their wives\\
270 - is a tidy little business, but I make
my real money\\
271 - selling them back to the husbands.\\
272 - Ah, I see.\\
273 - Well, okay, I'll come down.\\
274 - Where are you?\\
275 - Third Avenue and 32nd Street.\\
276 - Okay, I'll be right there.\\
277 - Ricky...\\
278 - Mi mujer me ha hecho lo peor\\
279 - que nunca me ha hecho a mi.\\
280 - Â¿Que paso?\\
281 - Lucy me vendio toda mi ropa vieja.\\
282 - Que barbaridad.\\
283 - Mira, que tiene vender la ropa...\\
284 - Hey, Rick, Ethel sold all my old
clothes\\
285 - to a secondhand man.\\
286 - Lucy tambien la vendio toda mi ropa
mia\\
287 - a Allen's Used Clothing Emporium
alli.\\
288 - That's the place.\\
289 - Â¿Tu sabes? Me vendio la camisa de
flanela mia\\
290 - que estaba un poquito aqui por los
codos\\
291 - pero estaba bueno todavia\\
292 - y el sueter mio que tenia la "H"\\
293 - de la Universidad de Habana me lo
vendio.\\
294 - She even sold the sweater\\
295 - I won in the Golden Gloves.\\
296 - Ay-yi-yi.\\
297 - Â¿Mira que son sin verguenza, eh?\\
298 - You can say that again.
Hmm!\\
299 - I'm going over there and get mine
back.\\
300 - Esperate que voy contigo.\\
301 - Adios, Alberto.\\
302 - Adios, Ricky.
Adios, Fred.\\
303 - Come on, friend.\\
304 - Hey, wait, Rick!\\
305 - What do you know about that?\\
306 - I've been talking Spanish.\\
307 - Come on. Let's get over there and get
this stuff.\\
308 - Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.\\
309 - Wait a minute.
What?\\
310 - I got an idea.\\
311 - I'll go get our clothes back.\\
312 - You go to a good clothing store, you
know,\\
313 - and get some, uh...
empty suit boxes.\\
314 - What for?\\
315 - To put our old clothes in.\\
316 - Our old clothes?
Yeah.\\
317 - I don't get it.\\
318 - You will. Here's what we do, look...\\
319 - Honey, I'm home!\\
320 - Well, darling, how's my Cuban dynamo?\\
321 - Fine.\\
322 - Oh, Brooks Brothers!\\
323 - Ricky, you bought some new clothes.\\
324 - Yep, I bought them, all right.\\
325 - Oh, well, that's just wonderful.\\
326 - Sort of a coincidence, too.\\
327 - Coincidence?\\
328 - Yes, uh, because I have\\
329 - some dreadful news to tell you\\
330 - about your old clothes.\\
331 - Oh, really?
What is that?\\
332 - Well, uh, today, I got feeling guilty
about last night.\\
333 - After all, if you want to wear
comfortable, old clothes,\\
334 - I should let you, so long as they're
clean.\\
335 - Yes.\\
336 - And Ethel felt the same way about
Fred's, too,\\
337 - so we got out all your old clothes\\
338 - and started to clean them.\\
339 - Oh, that was very nice.\\
340 - Yes.\\
341 - Uh, well, uh, you know how easily\\
342 - gasoline catches fire.\\
343 - Oh, you didn't use gasoline?\\
344 - Yes, I did. Yes, I did.\\
345 - I goofed.\\
346 - Uh... somehow or other,\\
347 - they got too close to the stove,\\
348 - and the first thing I knew...\\
349 - Poof! All your clothes burst into
flame.\\
350 - Oh, my goodness!\\
351 - And Fred's, too.\\
352 - Fred's, too?!\\
353 - Uh-huh. All that was left was just
some little old ashes.\\
354 - Just ashes. Worn-out ashes.\\
355 - I guess you're pretty upset, huh,
honey?\\
356 - No, no. You know, it's one of those
things\\
357 - that can happen to anybody.\\
358 - Aw, Ricky, you're so understanding.\\
359 - It's so wonderful to be married\\
360 - to such a sweet, kind and
understanding man.\\
361 - (chuckling)\\
362 - Thank you.\\
363 - Uh... I'd like to show you\\
364 - what I bought now, okay?\\
365 - Okay.\\
366 - Eww...\\
367 - Well, what do you think?\\
368 - They sure did a good job\\
369 - of sewing those ashes back together.\\
370 - Lucy, I bought these from a man.\\
371 - A man named Allen.\\
372 - Well, what luck, finding a set of
clothes\\
373 - just like the ones that burned.\\
374 - Yeah, how about that?\\
375 - Yeah, well, too bad we haven't got
the other set.\\
376 - We could sort of dress alike in
father and mother bum suits.\\
377 - (weak chuckle)\\
378 - I am not amused.\\
379 - No, I didn't think you would be.\\
380 - And furdermore...\\
381 - "Furdermore," what?\\
382 - Furthermore, I don't want you\\
383 - to ever give away, sell or get rid of\\
384 - my old clothes without my permission.\\
385 - Yes, sir.\\
386 - Imagine selling this swell shirt.\\
387 - Hi, Rick!\\
388 - Hiya, Fred!\\
389 - How do you like my shirt, huh?\\
390 - Oh, that's real snappy.\\
391 - How do you like this sweater?\\
392 - Oh, that's dandy, boy, that's
beautiful.\\
393 - You won't believe it.
Only this morning\\
394 - this thing was in a terrible fire.\\
395 - Is that so?\\
396 - FRED: Yeah.\\
397 - RICKY: Oh, my!\\
398 - (Ricky and Fred laugh)\\
399 - What are you gonna do?\\
400 - (laughter continues)\\
401 - All right, in a couple of minutes,\\
402 - we'll take that big mambo number,
huh?\\
403 - Well, Ricky, I got to be going.\\
404 - Oh, stick around, Fred.\\
405 - I've been here most of the afternoon.\\
406 - Ethel says if I keep hanging around
your rehearsal,\\
407 - you'll have to put me on the payroll.\\
408 - Well, wait till we do the big mambo
number.\\
409 - You mean the one with the gals in it?\\
410 - Yeah.\\
411 - Okay.\\
412 - Only this time\\
413 - I'm only rehearsing the orchestra.\\
414 - On second thought,\\
415 - I've got to get out of here.\\
416 - JERRY: Hi, Ricky.\\
417 - Oh, hi, Jerry.\\
418 - Hi, Jerry.\\
419 - I got great news.\\
420 - Publicity, I hope.\\
421 - Oh, yes, sir.\\
422 - I have just arranged to have you
named\\
423 - one of the ten best-dressed men in
our country.\\
424 - What?\\
425 - You're gonna get an award for being\\
426 - one of the ten best-dressed men in
our nation.\\
427 - One of the ten...\\
428 - (cracking up)\\
429 - Oh, no!\\
430 - Wait, what's so funny?\\
431 - I thought you'd be pleased.\\
432 - (laughing): One of the ten
best-dressed...\\
433 - I heard him.\\
434 - All right, so it's not the Academy
Award.\\
435 - I don't think it's that funny.\\
436 - I'm sorry, Jerry.\\
437 - It's just that our wives have been
riding us\\
438 - because they don't like the way we
dress.\\
439 - Oh, oh, that's it.\\
440 - Well, now listen, here's what's gonna
to happen.\\
441 - Tonight just before the show,\\
442 - some big shots are gonna come down\\
443 - to present you with the award\\
444 - and take some pictures, okay?\\
445 - Wonderful.\\
446 - Oh, Lucy will die when she finds out.\\
447 - So will Ethel.\\
448 - Oh, gee, Fred, I wish there was some
way\\
449 - that I could get you on that list.\\
450 - Hey, now, wait a minute, Ricky.\\
451 - I know I'm a good publicity man,\\
452 - but I'm not that good.\\
453 - Well!\\
454 - Hey, I know what.\\
455 - I can tell them\\
456 - that Fred is my fashion consultant.\\
457 - Him?\\
458 - Me?\\
459 - Yeah. Why not?\\
460 - Well, I suppose it'd be all right.\\
461 - Okay, I'll be back here at 7:00
tonight\\
462 - with the photographer.\\
463 - Okay. Bye.
Okay. See you later, boys.\\
464 - So long, Jerry.\\
465 - (chuckles)\\
466 - Hey, let's call the girls and tell
them, huh?\\
467 - Yeah.\\
468 - Gosh, it'd be great if we could
surprise them.\\
469 - That's a wonderful idea!\\
470 - What is?\\
471 - You know, sometimes\\
472 - I think you're much brighter than you
look.\\
473 - What did I say?\\
474 - Come on, now, let me in on it.\\
475 - We'll surprise the girls.\\
476 - You mean wait\\
477 - and let them read it in the papers?\\
478 - No, no, no. We'll ask them to come
down here\\
479 - and have dinner with us tonight.\\
480 - We won't tell them what for.\\
481 - And then we'll just watch their faces\\
482 - as they see us accept the award.\\
483 - Good.\\
484 - That's the best idea I ever had.\\
485 - Yeah.\\
486 - We'll sit in our play pen for a
while, that's what we'll do.\\
487 - (phone rings)
Sit down and play with that big bug.\\
488 - Mama answers the telephone.\\
489 - Sit down there and play with that.\\
490 - Play with it.\\
491 - Hello.\\
492 - Hi, honey.\\
493 - Oh, hi, darling.\\
494 - Listen, how would you and Ethel\\
495 - like to come down and have dinner\\
496 - with Fred and me tonight?\\
497 - Oh, gee, I have dinner on the stove.\\
498 - Well, take it off. We'll have it for
breakfast.\\
499 - Spaghetti?\\
500 - Oh... well, it'll keep.\\
501 - What's the occasion?\\
502 - Nothing.\\
503 - We just, uh, we just thought it'd be
nice.\\
504 - Well, gee, I don't know\\
505 - if I can get Mrs. Trumbull to take
care of the baby.\\
506 - Oh, sure, you can.\\
507 - Well, come on.
What's it all about?\\
508 - Nothing, honey.\\
509 - Lucy, can I have a cup of sugar?\\
510 - Wait a minute. Ethel's here.\\
511 - You want to go downtown and have
dinner with the boys?\\
512 - Yes.\\
513 - What boys?\\
514 - Fred and Ricky.\\
515 - Oh... yeah.\\
516 - All right, dear.\\
517 - Now, listen, you get all dolled up\\
518 - and be here at 7:00 tonight, okay?\\
519 - Fine.\\
520 - I'll see you later.\\
521 - All right, dear.\\
522 - Bye.
Bye.\\
523 - What's the occasion?\\
524 - I don't know.
He says it's nothing,\\
525 - but he wants us to get all dolled up,\\
526 - so it must be something special.\\
527 - Let's don't take any chances.\\
528 - I'll wear my blue crepe.\\
529 - What are you gonna wear?\\
530 - Lucy?\\
531 - Hmm?\\
532 - What are you gonna wear?\\
533 - Ethel, how much courage have you got?\\
534 - None.\\
535 - Come on, now, I've got an idea.\\
536 - No, no, I'm a coward.
I can't even wear purple\\
537 - 'cause it clashes with the stripe
down my back.\\
538 - Now, Ethel, you haven't even heard
the idea yet.\\
539 - I don't want to hear it.\\
540 - Let this be one idea that you keep a
secret.\\
541 - Just keep a...
Ethel, listen to me.\\
542 - This is one time we can get even with
these characters.\\
543 - Now, sit down, girl.\\
544 - Listen to me...\\
545 - Does that do it, Bill?\\
546 - Well, I'd like one with the wives in
it.\\
547 - Well, they'll be here any minute. Can
you wait?\\
548 - Sure.\\
549 - I'll get some more flashbulbs.\\
550 - And I want to talk...\\
551 - This is a wonderful thing.\\
552 - ETHEL: Fred!\\
553 - LUCY: Ricky!
Fred!\\
554 - Oh, here they come.\\
555 - Will you excuse us, please?\\
556 - Come in, yes.\\
557 - Pretend you don't know them.\\
558 - Hi, fellas.
Where are we?\\
559 - Are we late?\\
560 - Who are these people?\\
561 - I don't know, sir, but I'll take care
of them.\\
562 - Now, now, look here, my good men,\\
563 - I don't know how you got in here, but
you have to leave.\\
564 - Leave? After we got all dressed up
for dinner?\\
565 - Why, certainly, these are good movie
clothes,\\
566 - they must be good dinner clothes.\\
567 - Now, look, I'll give you a dime for a
cup of coffee.\\
568 - Now scram.
Come on.\\
569 - Could you give me a dollar for a cup
of coffee?\\
570 - I'm a big tipper.\\
571 - (guffawing)\\
572 - Whoo-hoo.\\
573 - Ho-ho.\\
574 - Hee-hee. Hoo-hoo.\\
575 - Ha-ha.
Hoo-hoo.\\
576 - Who are they?\\
577 - I never saw them before in my whole
life.\\
578 - Neither did I.\\
579 - What do you mean you never saw us
before?\\
580 - I'm Mrs. Ricardo, and this is Mrs.
Mertz.\\
581 - How do you do?\\
582 - Oh, well!
How do you do?\\
583 - What's that camera for?\\
584 - Wait a minute.
You don't want to use that picture.\\

587 - Jerry, do something.\\
588 - JERRY: Yes, I-I've got to...\\
589 - What happened?\\
590 - What's that camera for?\\
591 - Well, you really fixed yourself up
good this time.\\
592 - What do you mean?\\
593 - What happened?
What's that camera for?\\
594 - You'll see it in the papers with a
story.\\
595 - What story? What happ...
What's that picture for?\\
596 - It'll be in all the morning papers,\\
597 - and the caption will probably read:\\

5 - hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.\\
6 - Listen, I don't know, I think\\

9 - Okay.\\
10 - Sounds all right now.\\
11 - I guess it's me.\\
12 - (phone rings)\\
13 - We'll take it over in a couple of
minutes.\\
14 - Hello.\\
15 - Hi, dear.\\
16 - Oh, hello, honey.\\
17 - How are you, dear?\\
18 - Do you still have your headache?\\
19 - Yeah, I still have it.\\
20 - Oh...\\
21 - I wish I knew what was causing it.\\
22 - Oh, haven't you got any idea?\\
23 - Could it be something down there at
the club?\\
24 - No.\\
25 - No. Everything is real peaceful down
here.\\
26 - Oh, you know what I think?\\
27 - I think it's your eyes.\\
28 - Aah...\\
29 - Don't "aah" me now, Ricky.\\
30 - You promise me you'll go and have
your eyes examined.\\
31 - Oh, honey, I got a lot of work to do.\\

36 - Ricky!\\
37 - Bill Parker!\\
38 - Hiya. Good to see you.\\
39 - How are you, boy?\\
40 - Glad to see you.\\

town.\\
42 - I'm going back to the theater.\\
43 - Well, good.\\
44 - Say, uh...\\
45 - are you going to let me try for the
lead?\\
46 - Well, I would, Ricky,\\
47 - but you're not exactly the type for
an English professor.\\
48 - Oh, you mean my accent?\\
49 - Yeah.\\
50 - Oh, that's a phony.\\
51 - Sure...\\
52 - you know, people think that I really
talk this way,\\
53 - but I dun't.\\
54 - You "dun't," huh?\\
55 - No...\\
56 - Well, I'll keep you in mind.
Okay.\\
57 - Say, uh, I have a little problem.\\
58 - The theater that I've been using for
my auditions\\
59 - has been taken over by a TV show.\\
60 - You suppose I could use your club for
just a couple of days?\\
61 - Why, sure, Bill, anything you want at
all.\\
62 - Hey, how about having dinner with us
tonight?\\
63 - Wonderful!
Like to meet your wife.\\
64 - That's right, you haven't met Lucy,
have you?\\
65 - Not yet.\\
66 - Okay, I'll call her.\\
67 - You know, it'll be a pleasure\\
68 - to spend an evening with some folks\\
69 - who aren't trying to audition for my
show.\\
70 - Uh-oh.\\
71 - What's the matter?\\
72 - Uh, look, uh...\\
73 - if you want to spend a real pleasant
evening,\\
74 - I'd better introduce you\\
75 - as Bill Parker, an old friend of
mine,\\
76 - and not mention anything\\
77 - about your connections with show
business.\\
78 - Has your wife got aspirations?\\
79 - No, no, she's feeling all right.\\
80 - It's, uh...\\
81 - just that sh-she wants to get in show
business.\\
82 - I see.\\
83 - Well, I'll call her and tell her\\
84 - that you're just an old friend of
mine.\\
85 - Now, we won't say what kind of
business you're in.\\
86 - Okay, Ricky.\\
87 - Lucy, have you seen Fred?\\
88 - No, honey, I haven't.\\
89 - Listen, I want to ask you something.\\
90 - Uh, Lucy, have you seen Ethel?\\
91 - Oh, there you are.\\
92 - Oh, there you are.\\
93 - Where have you been?\\
94 - I've been looking for you.\\
95 - Where have you been?\\
96 - I've been looking for you.\\
97 - Where have you been?\\
98 - I've been looking...\\
99 - Oh, now, wait a minute.\\

sandpaper\\
104 - that new bannister you put in\\
105 - before some idiot runs his hand down
and picks up a splinter.\\
106 - What did you want?\\
107 - I was wondering if you'd help me\\
108 - get this splinter out of my hand.\\
109 - Oh, fine.
Come on.\\
110 - Hey, Ethel, wait a minute,\\
111 - I want to know if I can borrow your
big roaster.\\
112 - Sure. You having company?\\
113 - Well, Ricky said\\
114 - he was bringing home an old pal, a
Bill... Parker.\\
115 - I wonder if that could be William
Parker?\\
116 - You mean the William Parker?\\
117 - Well, he said his name was Bill.\\
118 - Who's William Parker?\\
119 - "Who's William Parker?" "Who's
William Parker?"\\
120 - Where's your Variety?\\
121 - Yeah, where's the Va...\\
122 - Right there.\\
123 - Oh, there was something about him\\

137 - "William Parker, formerly legit prod,
currently top pic exec\\
138 - seeks thesps for flesh tuner."\\
139 - Oh...\\
140 - Ethel, come here.\\
141 - (loudly): Who's William Parker?\\
142 - Oh.\\
143 - Oh, that's Variety talk.\\
144 - They have their own way of saying
things, see?\\
145 - That's for sure.\\
146 - "Parker preps prod for Pitt prem."\\
147 - Mm-hmm.\\
148 - That means "Parker prepares
production\\
149 - for Pittsburgh premiere."\\
150 - No kidding?
Uh-huh.\\
151 - And the rest of it means\\
152 - that he's a big shot from pictures\\
153 - who is auditioning for a musical\\
154 - that he's going to produce.\\
155 - And he's coming here to dinner!\\
156 - Well, gather round, friends, we have

157 - I'm ready.
What time is it, dear?\\
158 - It's a quarter to.\\
159 - Well, they ought to be here any
minute.\\
160 - Now, remember, we're gonna make it\\
161 - seem real casual and natural.\\
162 - Are you sure you can get rid of
Ricky?\\
163 - You just leave that to me, girl.\\
164 - RICKY: Here we are, Bill.\\
165 - Well, hi, everybody.\\

great, big favor\\
185 - and run down to the corner drugstore\\
186 - and get me some ice cream?\\
187 - Oh, we don't have to have ice cream.\\
188 - Oh, please, now, dear, I didn't have
time\\
189 - to make any dessert, Mr. Parker.\\
190 - Please, dear?\\
191 - All right. Will you excuse me?\\
192 - He'll be right back.\\
193 - Listen, dear, get me a quart of
vanilla\\
194 - and have them pack it in that special
packing...\\
195 - Vanilla?
Yes, honey.\\
196 - In that special packing.\\
197 - (piano note plays)\\
198 - There's no business like show
business\\
199 - Like no business I know\\
200 - Everything about it is appealing\\
201 - Everything the traffic will allow\\
202 - Nowhere can you get that happy
feeling\\
203 - When you are stealing that extra bow.\\
204 - There's no people like show people\\
205 - They smile when they are low\\
206 - Even with a turkey that you know will
fold\\
207 - You may get stranded out in the cold\\
208 - But you wouldn't change it for a
stack of gold\\
209 - Let's go on with the show.\\
210 - There's no business like show
business\\
211 - Like no business I know\\
212 - ETHEL: Everything about it is
appealing\\
213 - Everything the traffic will allow\\
214 - Nowhere can you get that happy
feeling\\
215 - ALL: When you are stealing that extra
bow.\\
216 - There's no people like show people\\
217 - Like no...\\
218 - Oh...\\
219 - How did you get back so quickly,
dear?\\
220 - Mrs. Benson gave me some ice cream
from her freezer.\\
221 - LUCY: Oh.\\
222 - I'm sorry, Bill.\\
223 - That's all right, Ricky.\\
224 - How did you find out who I was?\\
225 - Oh, we know who's who in show
business, Mr. Parker.\\
226 - We know all about you prepping for
your Pitt prem.\\
227 - Looks like Variety double-crossed me.\\
228 - Are you mad, sir?
No.\\
229 - Oh, well, that's good because we
haven't finished yet.\\
230 - You sit down now, Ricky, and you can
see the...\\
231 - you can see the last of our act.\\
232 - I've seen the last of your act.\\
233 - Oh, now, honey.\\
234 - That isn't fair!\\
235 - Well, I suppose that you call it fair\\
236 - to send me out on a wild-duck chase\\
237 - for some ice cream that you don't
need\\
238 - just so you can audition behind my
back.\\
239 - Is that what you call fair?\\
240 - Goose.\\
241 - What?\\
242 - Wild-goose chase.\\
243 - I don't care what kind of a chase you
call it.\\
244 - Well...
You know what I'm talking about.\\
245 - Look, kids, I got an idea.\\
246 - I'll make a deal with you.\\
247 - If it's all right with Ricky,\\
248 - let me forget business for tonight,
huh? And tomorrow,\\
249 - tomorrow you can all come down and
audition for me. How's that?\\
250 - Oh, Ricky, did you hear what he said,
huh?\\
251 - Huh, Ricky, huh?\\
252 - Okay. I guess it's Bill's business\\
253 - if he wants to waste his time on you.\\
254 - Oh, that's great!	   Oh...\\
255 - Mr. Parker, what kind of a show are
you doing?\\
256 - Well, it's a college musical.\\
257 - It's called The Professor and the
Co-ed.\\
258 - Say, you folks, you would be
wonderful for the alumni scene.\\
259 - Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Parker.\\
260 - Oh, well, what can I do?\\
261 - Can you dance?\\
262 - Can I dance!\\
263 - Can you jitterbug?\\
264 - Can I jitterbug!\\
265 - Can you put dinner on the table?\\
266 - Can I put dinner on...\\
267 - Oh, yeah.\\
268 - Lucy.
Yeah?\\
269 - Have you still got that hat you wore\\
270 - when you did the Charleston down at
the club?\\
271 - Yeah. You want it?\\
272 - Yeah. We're doing the varsity drag\\
273 - for our number-- you know, wear those
1920 clothes.\\
274 - Fred's digging stuff out of his
costume trunk.\\
275 - Oh, that sounds wonderful.\\
276 - Gee, I hope my jitterbug number comes
off all right.\\
277 - Do you know how to jitterbug?\\
278 - Well, I will as soon as my teacher
gets here.\\
279 - You can't learn jitterbugging from a
teacher.\\
280 - It's something you pick up in school,
like measles.\\
281 - Well, all I know is, Ricky's agent
said\\
282 - he was sending somebody down here\\
283 - that could teach me how to jitterbug.\\
284 - That's all I know.\\
285 - I think that thing is in here.\\
286 - Yeah, here it is.
Yeah...\\
287 - (chuckles)\\
288 - Ain't I the cat's pajamas?\\
289 - Oh, you're the snake's hips.\\
290 - Let me see how I look in it.\\
291 - Be my guest.\\
292 - That's a real razzmatazz, isn't it?\\
293 - Oh, I feel just like a flapper again.\\
294 - Well, call me a taxi!\\
295 - (guffawing)\\
296 - (door buzzer sounds)\\
297 - Oh, that must be my teacher.\\
298 - Will you open the door for him?\\
299 - Yeah.\\
300 - I'm looking for Mrs. Ricardo.\\
301 - Oh, I'm Mrs. Ricardo.\\

to wear.\\
311 - Man, that's cool!\\
312 - Well, thanks.\\
313 - I think.\\
314 - Do you think you could teach me\\
315 - how to jitterbug?\\

337 - doing the varsity drag, do you?\\
338 - That coat's a gasser!\\
339 - Uh, yeah, well...\\
340 - I have a record here.\\
341 - I hope it's all right.\\
342 - Uh, let's see now.\\

361 - And you're a gasser!\\
362 - LUCY: You're the mostest!\\
363 - Hmm! And people say I'm hard to

364 - Mr. Parker, can we be in your show?
Can we, can we?\\
365 - And what about us?\\
366 - Yeah, can you use our act?\\
367 - Give us the message, man!
Yeah.\\
368 - Well, I don't know.\\
369 - Ricky, is there any way I can arrange\\
370 - to see them work in front of an
audience?\\
371 - Nope.\\
372 - Oh, Ricky, why can't we\\
373 - work right here tonight?\\
374 - No, sir.\\
375 - First up, Daddy-O, give us the real
reason!\\
376 - Yeah. Come on.
Come on, Rick, what's the harm?\\
377 - Come on.
Come on.\\
378 - You heard what the man said.\\
379 - He said we could dance up a storm.\\
380 - He thinks we're real wiggy, man.\\
381 - Yeah.\\
382 - Now, look, wait a minute.\\
383 - First place, I'm not running\\
384 - an amateur night in here.\\
385 - And in the second place,\\
386 - you're starting to give me a headache
again.\\
387 - ETHEL: Oh, Rick, come on, now.\\
388 - Ricky, just...\\
389 - Didn't you go to see the eye doctor?\\
390 - No.\\
391 - Oh, Ricky, now you're gonna go\\
392 - right this minute. Come on.\\
393 - Now wait a minute.
What about our act?\\
394 - Do we get to go on tonight?\\
395 - Yeah, Ricky, what about...\\
396 - Let's put them on tonight.\\
397 - I'd like to get audience reaction.\\
398 - All right, Bill, if that's what you
want.\\
399 - We'll put them on.\\
400 - Oh, that's fine!\\
401 - Yes, great.\\
402 - Oh, thank you.\\
403 - Now open wide.\\
404 - Wider.\\
405 - Wider.\\
406 - Oh, Grandma, what big eyes you have.\\
407 - Oh, Lucy, you're making me nervous.\\
408 - Now sit down.\\
409 - Oh, all right.\\
410 - Now look up.\\
411 - Now look down.\\
412 - Uh-huh.\\
413 - Now follow my finger, please.\\
414 - All right, watch it carefully.\\
415 - Uh-huh.\\
416 - Well, how is it, Doc?\\
417 - Oh, I haven't completed my
examination yet.\\
418 - Oh.
Would you please turn and face the
wall?\\
419 - Yes, sir.\\
420 - Now, do you see that chart?\\
421 - (laughing)\\
422 - What's so funny?\\
423 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
424 - I was just thinking\\
425 - about a television show I saw the
other night,\\
426 - and the eye doctor said to the
patient,\\
427 - "Do you see that chart?"\\
428 - And the patient said, "What chart?"\\
429 - And... and the doctor said, "The
chart on the wall."\\
430 - And the patient said, "What wall?"\\
431 - (laughing loudly)\\
432 - How are his eyes, Doctor?\\
433 - Could you read the first line,
please?\\
434 - RICKY: "E."\\
435 - That's right.\\
436 - Oh.\\
437 - Next line, please.\\
438 - "F, P."\\
439 - Could you read the fourth line,
please?\\
440 - "L, P, E, D."\\
441 - Oh, Ricky.\\
442 - You see, it is your eyes, darling.\\
443 - That's a "B," not an "E."\\
444 - Looks like an "E" to me.\\
445 - Read the next line, please.\\
446 - "P, E, C, F, D."\\
447 - "P, E, C, F, D"!\\
448 - Oh, my poor baby.\\
449 - What's the matter?\\
450 - That isn't "P, E, C, F, D".\\
451 - That's "F, E, O, P, B".\\
452 - That's "P, E, C, F, D"!\\
453 - Ah, well, this is just the
stubbornest man\\
454 - in the world, Doctor.\\
455 - Go ahead, tell him how bad his eyes
really are.\\
456 - Mr. Ricardo, your eyes are perfectly
normal.\\
457 - You see, darling, you wouldn't
believe me...\\
458 - What?!\\
459 - I said your husband's vision was
perfectly normal.\\
460 - Well, how can you say that?\\
461 - What about that line?\\
462 - He said it was "P, E, C, F, D."\\
463 - Anybody can see that it's "P, E, C,
F..."\\
464 - Eww.\\
465 - "...D."\\
466 - That'll be all for you, Mr. Ricardo.\\
467 - Thank you, sir.\\
468 - Come here, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
469 - Me?\\
470 - Come here.\\
471 - No.\\
472 - Come on.\\
473 - No, I don't wanna.\\
474 - Come on, Lucy.\\
475 - Do what the doctor says.\\
476 - Come here.\\
477 - What's the matter, can't you see the
chair?\\
478 - Yes, I can see the chair.\\
479 - What are you going to do?\\
480 - I just want to have a look at your
eyes.\\
481 - You don't have to worry about your
eyes, Mr. Ricardo.\\
482 - Just stop working so hard\\
483 - and those headaches will disappear.\\
484 - Oh, thank you, Doctor.\\
485 - Listen, honey, I got to go down to
the club,\\
486 - so I'll see you later.\\
487 - All right, bye.
Good-bye.\\
488 - Good-bye, Doctor.
Good-bye.\\
489 - What did you put in my eyes?\\
490 - Oh, just some drops to relax them.\\
491 - They'll take effect in about 20
minute...\\
492 - Oh, my goodness.\\
493 - What's the matter?\\
494 - What?\\
495 - I've never known those drops\\
496 - to work so quickly before.\\
497 - You must be very sensitive to them.\\
498 - Really?
Oh, yes.\\
499 - Your vision will be quite blurred for
several hours.\\
500 - Oh, no, no!\\
501 - It can't be!
I have to dance tonight.\\
502 - You got to take the drops out.\\
503 - Get them out!\\
504 - You can't squeeze them out, Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
505 - But you have nothing to worry about.\\
506 - Here, here, look at me. Look at me.\\
507 - Now, your vision won't be any more
blurred\\
508 - than I look right now.\\
509 - Oh, no!\\
510 - Hi, Lucy, what did the doctor say?\\
511 - Oh, Ethel, gee.\\
512 - Guess what happened\\
513 - You'll never know what...\\
514 - Hey, what's the matter with you?\\
515 - What? Ethel, what happened?
Where are you?\\
516 - I'm over here, Miss Magoo.\\
517 - Oh. Oh, Ethel,\\
518 - guess what happened.\\
519 - What's the matter?\\
520 - Ricky's eyes were all right,\\
521 - but the doctor said he wanted to
examine mine\\
522 - and the first thing I knew, he put
drops in them.\\
523 - You mean he dilated them?\\
524 - Yeah, and I-I'm just... hoping\\
525 - that I'll be able to dance tonight.\\
526 - Oh, you'd better cancel it.\\
527 - Oh, but Ethel, I can't, I can't!\\
528 - There's nothing else to do.\\
529 - But-but-but I've worked so hard on my
number.\\
530 - I've just got to do it.\\
531 - No, you'd better cancel it.\\
532 - Ethel, I can't, I just can't.\\
533 - Listen...\\
534 - Oh, Ethel.\\
535 - I don't know how you're gonna dance
if you can't see.\\
536 - Listen, listen, I'm going in to
change my clothes,\\
537 - and you take me down there in a taxi.\\
538 - Here, here, here.\\
539 - This way.\\

10 - I've had to relax all day.\\
11 - What'll we do tonight?\\
12 - Oh, I don't know.
What's on television?\\
13 - Fight night!\\
14 - Oh, no, you don't.
Just sit down.\\
15 - (groans)      Sit down.\\
16 - I've looked at so many fights on
television,\\
17 - I've got cauliflower eyes.\\
18 - Come on, now, we're four grown
people.\\
19 - Let's entertain ourselves.\\
20 - Okay.		Okay.\\
21 - Um...\\
22 - Oh, come now.\\
23 - Surely we can think of something\\
24 - to entertain ourselves.\\
25 - (trilling)\\
26 - Oh, stop that.\\
27 - (laughing)\\
28 - How about playing some cards?\\
29 - No, we can't.\\
30 - Little Ricky ate the queen of spades.\\
31 - Oh...\\
32 - Besides, I'd like to think\\
33 - of something a little more
intellectual.\\
34 - I know, we'll take a quiz.\\
35 - A quiz?\\
36 - Yeah, it's all about husbands and
wives.\\
37 - Oh, no.\\
38 - You know what those are, Fred.\\
39 - (falsetto): "How to rate your
marriage, or is your spouse a louse?"\\
40 - Don't laugh at him, Ethel.\\
41 - Now, here it is.\\
42 - Now, I'll keep score.\\
43 - Now, just a minute.\\
44 - Let us in on it.\\
45 - What is it called?\\
46 - "How to rate your marriage, or is
your spouse a louse?"\\
47 - You read it, you louse!\\
48 - No, I'm sorry, but I didn't read it.\\
49 - Go ahead.\\
50 - Oh, let's see now, I'll keep score,\\
51 - and at the end, we'll add them all up\\
52 - and see if each of us is married to
our perfect mate.\\
53 - For this, I need a quiz?\\
54 - All right, now, first question.\\
55 - Uh, Do you tell your troubles\\
56 - to your married partner?\\
57 - Ethel?\\
58 - Yes.\\
59 - Yes.\\
60 - Fred?\\
61 - Well, I try to spare her all I can.\\
62 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
63 - Put down "yes" for the king of the
bellyachers.\\
64 - And "yes" for Ricky, and "yes" for
Lucy.\\
65 - Now, wait a minute.
Don't put down "yes" for me.\\
66 - You have no idea of all the problems
I have.\\
67 - I don't tell you my troubles.\\
68 - Oh, I'm sorry, dear.\\
69 - I thought all those troubles you
brought home were yours.\\
70 - "No" for Ricky.\\
71 - Now, next question.\\
72 - "Do you tell your husband or wife\\
73 - how much you pay for your clothes?"\\
74 - Ethel?\\
75 - Well?\\
76 - It's been so long since I bought any,
I forgot.\\
77 - Put down "yes."\\
78 - Fred?\\
79 - Yeah.\\
80 - Ricky?\\
81 - Of course.\\
82 - Now, next question.\\
83 - Have you told your husband...?\\
84 - Wait a minute.\\
85 - What's the matter?\\
86 - The quiz mistress neglected\\
87 - to ask herself the last question.\\
88 - Oh, I did?\\
89 - Yeah.\\
90 - The question was:\\
91 - Do you tell your husband\\
92 - how much you pay for your clothes?\\
93 - That's right. Now, the next
question...\\
94 - Uh-uh-uh.\\
95 - All right, one "no" for Lucy.\\
96 - Uh-huh.\\
97 - Now, the next question.\\
98 - Have you told your husband or wife\\
99 - all about your past romances?\\
100 - Well, if I told Fred...    Ricky?\\
101 - Me? It's Ethel's turn first.\\
102 - Yeah, well, I thought\\
103 - I'd break the monotony by asking you
first.\\
104 - Besides, I can't wait to hear your
answers.\\
105 - Have you told me all about your past
romances?\\
106 - Well, now, let me see.\\
107 - Uh...\\
108 - Well?\\
109 - Wait a minute.\\
110 - Eh, yeah, I told you everything, yep.\\
111 - "Yes" for Ricky.\\
112 - Well, if I told Fred...
Now, for me.\\
113 - Let's see. Have I told you about my
old romances?\\
114 - I told you about going with the
captain\\
115 - of the football team, didn't I?\\
116 - Yes, a hundred times.\\
117 - Then there was that lifeguard who was
so crazy about me.\\
118 - Yes, you bared your soul to me about
him, too.\\
119 - Yes, well, besides those, there were
just a few\\
120 - big flaming romances that I've had.\\
121 - Let's see. Billy, Maury, Jess and
Jerry,\\
122 - Bob and Bennett and George and
Phil...\\
123 - Martin and Danny, Argyle and Bud\\
124 - and Wilbur and Noble and Carl\\
125 - Frank and Henry-- that was in high
school--\\
126 - Uh, then in junior college, there was
Johnny and Kenny...\\
127 - Okay, okay, okay.\\
128 - Well, I was only trying to be honest
and make sure\\
129 - I had told you about everybody, dear.\\
130 - I sensed that.\\
131 - Well, now I can put down "yes" with a
very clear conscience.\\
132 - (clears throat)\\
133 - Now, uh, Ethel?\\
134 - Well, if I told Fred all about...\\
135 - Hey, uh, have I ever told you about
Carlota Romero?\\
136 - Who?\\
137 - Carlota Romero.\\
138 - No. Who's she?\\
139 - Oh, I didn't tell you about her, huh?\\
140 - No.		Oh.\\
141 - Just a girl I used to go with in
Cuba.\\
142 - Oh.\\
143 - Now, I told you I can keep my "yes"
answer\\
144 - and be honest about it.\\
145 - Yeah.\\
146 - Ethel?\\
147 - Well...\\
148 - Why haven't you told me about her
before?\\
149 - Oh, I don't know.\\
150 - No particular reason.\\
151 - It just slipped my mind.\\
152 - Oh.\\
153 - Was it a big romance?\\
154 - Well, you know...
just... one of those thins.\\
155 - Just one of those "thins".\\
156 - Well, come on, Ethel.\\
157 - What are you waiting for?\\
158 - I've forgotten the question.\\
159 - The question is: Have you told your
husband or...?\\
160 - Just one of those what "thins"?\\
161 - Come on, now, Lucy, it's my turn.\\
162 - There's just no point in going on
with this quiz.\\
163 - It's very obvious that one of us\\
164 - has so many secrets from his mate,\\
165 - he couldn't possibly be happily
married.\\
166 - I am, too.\\
167 - Well, I'm not.\\
168 - Oh, honey, you're getting upset over
nothing.\\
169 - If it was nothing,\\
170 - why didn't you tell me about it
before?\\
171 - Well, because there is no Carlota
Romero.\\
172 - I just made it up.\\
173 - Ha!\\
174 - Would you join me in your apartment,
Ethel?\\
175 - Oh, honey, you're being silly.\\
176 - I'm not speaking to you.\\
177 - Oh, now, Lucy, he's trying to get
even\\
178 - because you mentioned all those boys'
names.\\
179 - FRED: Wow! She's really burned.\\
180 - I think you'd have been better off\\
181 - telling her about that dame.\\
182 - I did, I told her the truth.\\
183 - I told her I made it up.\\
184 - There's no Carlota Romero.\\
185 - Well, Lucy doesn't believe you,\\
186 - so what are you going to do about
her?\\
187 - Oh, gee, I don't know.\\
188 - I didn't expect her to get that mad.\\
189 - I was just teasing her.\\
190 - You know, we've been married for 12
years,\\
191 - and I still can't figure her out.\\
192 - I bet sometimes you wish you had made
her up.\\
193 - Well, she'll get over it.\\
194 - Yeah, Ethel will look after her.\\
195 - Come on, let's, let's look at the
fights.\\
196 - Okay. Maybe it's time for the main
event.\\
197 - Here we go, honey.\\
198 - Eat a great big breakfast.\\
199 - Aw, come on.\\
200 - Eat a great big breakfast.\\
201 - Aw, come on, honey, come on.\\
202 - Come on.\\
203 - What's the matter, boy?\\
204 - Hi.\\
205 - (bawling)\\
206 - Hello, son.
What's the matter?\\
207 - What are you crying about?\\
208 - Don't answer him, Ricky.\\
209 - I don't want you associating with a
man of his reputation.\\
210 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
211 - Now, listen, honey.\\
212 - In fact, Neither of us are going to
talk to him\\
213 - until he explains his lurid past.\\
214 - Hi, Rick.\\
215 - Oh, hi, Fred.\\
216 - Boy, you're the sly one.\\
217 - What are you talking about?\\
218 - You know what I'm talking about.\\
219 - I just saw the morning paper.\\
220 - Look, I got enough troubles\\
221 - without playing games.
What's up?\\
222 - You remember that, uh, gal you made
up, uh, Carlota Romero?\\
223 - Yeah.\\
224 - Well, you did a pretty good job.\\
225 - She's appearing in town this week.\\
226 - What?!\\
227 - "What?"\\
228 - Right here in the paper.
Look at that.\\
229 - RICKY: "Carlota Romero, Cuban singing
star\\
230 - "opened her first American engagement\\
231 - at the Opal Room."\\
232 - Oh, no!\\
233 - Not bad.\\
234 - (whistles)\\
235 - I'll say this for you,\\
236 - when you make them up, you don't do
badly.\\
237 - You know, I must have seen her name
in Variety or Billboard,\\
238 - and it got stuck in my mind.\\
239 - Yeah, well, when Lucy sees that
picture,\\
240 - she'll knock it loose.\\
241 - Ay-ay-ay. Now, look.\\
242 - Fred, ta-ta-ta-take this paper home
with you, huh?\\
243 - I've already got a copy.\\
244 - I know, you got a copy, but take it
home with you.\\
245 - I don't want Lucy won't see it.\\
246 - I'm still trying to convince her that
I made it up.\\
247 - Oh, well, all right.\\
248 - Ee...\\
249 - Oh, what a tangled web we weave.\\
250 - Huh?\\
251 - That's an old saying.\\
252 - "Oh, what a tangled web we weave\\
253 - when first we practice to deceive."\\
254 - What does that mean?\\
255 - Well, it means that, uh...\\
256 - Well, I'll have it translated in
Spanish\\
257 - and bring it back to you.\\
258 - Hi, Lucy.\\
259 - Hi, girl.\\
260 - Well, you're in a better mood than I
expected you to be.\\
261 - Oh, you mean about what happened last
night?\\
262 - Well...\\
263 - I'll give Ricky a bad time for a
while,\\
264 - but I believed him when he said\\
265 - he made up that Carlota Romero
business.\\
266 - Well, how did he explain this
morning's paper?\\
267 - Why, what about it?\\
268 - Uh-oh.\\
269 - What about it?\\
270 - Um, nothing, nothing.\\
271 - Come on, Ethel, what's in the paper\\
272 - you don't want me to see?\\
273 - Uh, uh, well, uh,\\
274 - I didn't want to be the one to tell
you,\\
275 - but, uh...
But what?\\
276 - Uh, Daddy Warbucks has left Little
Orphan Annie again.\\
277 - Oh, Ethel, let me see that paper.\\
278 - It's on the back page.\\
279 - "Carlota Romero, Cuban singing star,\\
280 - "opens her first American engagement\\
281 - at the Opal Room."\\
282 - Oh, now...\\
283 - Now, Lucy, pull yourself together.\\
284 - It says in the paper, she's never
been in America,\\
285 - so Ricky couldn't have seen her for
15 years.\\
286 - Well, she's here now.\\
287 - I'll bet they're planning to stir up
those old embers again.\\
288 - Be kind of hard to stir embers into a
flame after 15 years.\\
289 - She doesn't look like her pilot light
would ever go out.\\
290 - Oh, let me see that.\\
291 - Oh, forget it.\\
292 - You got nothing to worry about.\\
293 - She couldn't take Ricky away from
you.\\
294 - Why, you're twice as pretty as she
is.\\
295 - You really think so?\\
296 - Certainly, and you got twice as good
a figure.\\
297 - I have?\\
298 - Mmm-hmmm.\\
299 - Oh, I wish I could stand and carry
myself the way you do.\\
300 - It's absolutely regal.\\
301 - Frankly, I can't understand\\
302 - why you were never chosen Miss

364 - What's the matter?\\
365 - What's the matter?\\
366 - What's the matter?\\
367 - What's the matter?\\
368 - Lucy, what's the matter?\\
369 - That's... that's for running off with
that castanet-clacker,\\
370 - you big Cuban heel!\\
371 - Are you crazy or something?!\\
372 - Lucy!\\
373 - Lucy!\\
374 - Lucy!\\
375 - Lucy, what's the matter with you?\\
376 - What's the matter?\\
377 - I dreamed you left me for Carlota
Romero.\\
378 - Oh, for goodness' sakes.\\
379 - That's the craziest thing I ever
heard in my whole life.\\
380 - I'm not so sure.\\
381 - She's right here in town, as if you
didn't know.\\
382 - Now, listen to me, I made that name
up.\\
383 - Or at least I-I-I-I thought I made
the name up.\\
384 - I must have read it someplace or
something without noticing\\
385 - because this morning when, when Fred
came over and...\\
386 - and here was this girl's picture in
the paper and then,\\
387 - and here I-I didn't even know this
girl\\
388 - and-and here I made the same name up.\\
389 - Isn't that a funny coincidence, huh?\\
390 - (weak chuckle)\\
391 - No?\\
392 - Who are you trying to kid?\\
393 - Look, if...\\
394 - You big two-timing button-giver!\\
395 - Button-giver?\\
396 - What does that mean?\\
397 - Never mind. You going to tell me the
truth or aren't you?\\
398 - Now, look, honey, if you don't
believe me,\\
399 - why don't you call her up and ask
her?\\
400 - I'll just do that.\\
401 - Okay.\\
402 - Okay!\\
403 - O-kay.\\
404 - Huh, gee.\\
405 - And don't do that no more!\\
406 - Hi.\\
407 - Oh, hi, dear.\\
408 - What's going on?\\
409 - Company tonight.\\
410 - Oh? Who?\\
411 - Ethel and Fred and Jerry and Carlota.\\
412 - Who?\\
413 - Carlota. Carlota Romero.\\
414 - You remember her.\\
415 - Why did you ask her over for?\\
416 - Because I wanted to see you two
together.\\
417 - Jerry called her up and set the whole
thing up for me.\\
418 - Fine agent I got.\\
419 - Mira, que tiene de mal la mujer aqui
en la casaa\\
420 - que ni la conozco.\\
421 - And if you're going to mumble,\\
422 - please have the decency to mumble in
English.\\
423 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
424 - Here she is.\\
425 - Hi.\\
426 - Oh, it's only the Mertzes.\\
427 - Well, thanks.\\
428 - You know, that's getting to be our
first name:\\
429 - "Mr. And Mrs.
Only-The-Mertzes."\\
430 - I'm sorry, dear, won't you come in
and sit down?\\
431 - Hi, Rick.
Hi, Ethel.\\
432 - Oh, food.\\
433 - Hiya, Fred.\\
434 - Hi.\\
435 - Now, Fred, leave those alone!\\
436 - They're for company.\\
437 - Well, what am I?\\
438 - Don't answer that.\\
439 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
440 - Hi.\\
441 - Oh, it's only Jerry.\\
442 - Well!\\
443 - Everybody's got the same first name
these days.\\
444 - Thanks, Lucy.
Hi, Ethel, Fred.\\
445 - Hi, Jerry.
Jerry, how are you?\\
446 - Hi, Jerry.\\
447 - Where's Carlota?\\
448 - Oh, she told me on the telephone,\\
449 - she had to go on an interview and
she'd meet me up here.\\
450 - Good, the sooner, the better.\\
451 - Oh, yeah, and Ricky, she said can
hardly\\
452 - wait to see you again.\\
453 - That's nice.\\
454 - What?\\
455 - Aha!\\
456 - Now, Lucy, it isn't true.\\
457 - Never mind!\\
458 - Now, Jerry, what are you talking
about?\\
459 - I never saw this girl before in my
whole life.\\
460 - Well, sure you did.\\
461 - She told me on the phone she worked
with you\\
462 - in a nightclub in Havana, oh, about
15 or 16 years ago.\\
463 - She was part of a singing act.\\
464 - They called themselves the Five
Romero Sisters.\\
465 - Oh, for goodness' sakes.\\
466 - Which one of them?\\
467 - Well, now, how should I know?\\
468 - Anyway, she was very surprised to
hear\\
469 - that you remembered her, see?\\
470 - And, oh, she said be sure and don't
to expect her\\
471 - to look exactly like she did in the
picture in the paper\\
472 - because that was taken, oh, about 17
years ago.\\
473 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
474 - There she is now.\\
475 - Ricky, I'm Carlota!\\
476 - Hey, wait a minute, I'm not Ricky.\\
477 - Ricky!\\
478 - Nope.\\
479 - Ricky!\\
480 - Yes, hello, Carlota.\\
481 - How are you?\\
482 - Glad to see you.\\
483 - This is Mr. and Mrs. Mertz.\\
484 - Oh, hello, Carlota.\\
485 - This is my agent, Jerry.\\
486 - How you doing?\\
487 - Well, it's nice to see you.\\
488 - What have you been doing since I last
saw you?\\
489 - Putting on weight mostly.\\
490 - (laughing)\\
491 - Well, you look fine.\\
492 - Was that Carlota?\\
493 - Yes.\\
494 - Where is she?\\
495 - Oh, Lucy, I'd like you to meet
someone.\\
496 - LUCY: Oh.\\
497 - This is Carlota Romero.\\
498 - Oh, how do you...?\\
499 - Carlota Romer...\\
500 - Well, am I glad to see you!\\
501 - Hello, Lucy.\\
502 - Oh, my, you will never know.\\
503 - I am so glad to see you.\\
504 - Come over here and sit down.\\
505 - This is quite a welcome.\\
506 - I'm surprised that Ricky would even
remember me.\\
507 - Well, my dear, he will never forget
you.\\
508 - That's nice.\\
509 - I guess I look a little different\\
510 - than you expected, don't I?\\
511 - Well, uh, yes, yes.\\
512 - I didn't expect anyone so pretty and
charming\\
513 - and so full of...\\
514 - well, so full of...\\
515 - Uh...\\
516 - Well, so full.\\
517 - Tell, me, Carlota,\\

3 - No, thanks.\\
4 - No, thank you, honey.\\
5 - Ethel?\\
6 - Oh, I might as well\\
7 - finish up that last little dab.\\
8 - Potatoes?\\
9 - No, thanks.\\
10 - Uh-uh.\\
11 - Ethel?\\
12 - Just another taste.\\
13 - I hate to see food go to waste.\\
14 - Salad?\\
15 - No, thanks.\\
16 - I couldn't eat another bite, honey.\\
17 - Mm-mmm-mmm.\\
18 - Sometimes, I feel\\
19 - like I was married to a garbage
disposal.\\
20 - Oh, leave her alone, Fred.\\
21 - So she's got a good appetite.\\
22 - Sure, she's just a growing girl.\\
23 - Yeah, but she's growing sideways.\\
24 - Quiet, fat boy.\\
25 - Lucy, this is the best salad dressing\\
26 - I ever tasted.\\
27 - Well, thank you very much.\\
28 - Well, now, for once, you're right.\\
29 - Why don't you buy a bottle of that
stuff, Ethel?\\
30 - Oh, you can't buy it.\\
31 - I made it myself, Fred.\\
32 - You know, you ought to bottle that,
Lucy,\\
33 - and sell it.\\
34 - Oh, Fred!\\
35 - Well, I mean it.\\
36 - I bet you could make a lot of money.\\
37 - (chuckles)\\
38 - Money, money...\\
39 - Where did I hear that word today?\\
40 - Oh, yes, the teller at the bank
called me\\
41 - and said that someone's account was
overdrawn.\\
42 - Guess who the teller said was
overdrawn, Lucy.\\
43 - Uh, aren't these delicious-looking
pastries?\\
44 - They're real gooey.\\
45 - I'll, uh, I'll give you a hint:\\
46 - He says it's someone who shares my
joint account,\\
47 - but it's not me.\\
48 - Go on, Lucy, guess.\\
49 - Please, not while I'm eating.\\
50 - All right.\\
51 - Not while you're eating.\\
52 - Cake, Ethel?\\
53 - I don't know where I'd put it.\\
54 - Just drop it into the bottomless pit.\\
55 - (chuckling uncontrollably)\\
56 - Are you finished eating?\\
57 - No, no, I'm not finished yet.\\
58 - I'll wait.\\
59 - These are very good.\\
60 - Made fresh today.\\
61 - Finished?\\
62 - Nope.\\
63 - I never can seem to get enough of
these.\\
64 - Are you finished now?\\
65 - Yeah.\\
66 - Now, would you mind telling me\\
67 - why you were overdrawn at the bank?\\
68 - Every month, I put money in the bank\\
69 - and every month,\\
70 - you spend it all and more besides.\\
71 - I don't understand it.\\
72 - I mean, I'd like to know the reason.\\
73 - Now, why are you overdrawn at the
bank?\\
74 - Lucy?\\
75 - Eww...\\
76 - Well, how'd things go after we left
last night?\\
77 - Pretty rough, huh?\\
78 - It was the biggest battle of the
budget yet.\\
79 - We thrashed out every item in my
books.\\
80 - It was just terrible, Ethel.\\
81 - I've used up my allowance until June
12.\\
82 - Oh, that's not bad.\\
83 - June 12, 1978?\\
84 - Oh... well, money isn't everything.\\
85 - Yeah, with me, it isn't anything.\\
86 - Gee, I wish I could invent something\\
87 - that would be worth a million
dollars.\\
88 - You sound just like Fred Mertz.\\
89 - Fred?\\
90 - Yeah. Ever since we've been married,\\
91 - he's been trying to think up\\
92 - one idea worth a million dollars.\\
93 - None of his ideas any good, huh?\\
94 - Oh, he had some good ideas,\\
95 - but somebody always got to the patent
office first.\\
96 - He's still mad at Edison\\
97 - for beating him to the electric
light.\\
98 - And he's never forgiven Ford for
scooping him\\
99 - with the horseless carriage.\\
100 - Well, at least, he was trying.\\
101 - I haven't even got an idea.\\
102 - Ethel, I've got it!\\
103 - Got what?\\
104 - I know how to make a million dollars.\\
105 - How?\\
106 - Remember last night when Fred was
raving\\
107 - about my salad dressing?
Yeah.\\
108 - Well, he's right.
I'm gonna bottle it\\
109 - and put it on the market.\\
110 - Bottle it and sell it.\\
111 - Yeah! It's the best salad dressing I
ever tasted.\\
112 - We can make it right here in the
kitchen.\\
113 - Will you help me?
Sure.\\
114 - It's a real simple recipe.\\
115 - I have it right here.\\
116 - Let's see. Here it is.\\
117 - There now.	    Let me see.\\
118 - Let's see now.
What'll we call it?\\
119 - My Aunt Martha gave it to me.\\
120 - I suppose we really ought to call it\\
121 - "Aunt Martha's Salad Dressing."\\
122 - Sure.\\
123 - It needs more than that, though.\\
124 - How about...\\
125 - "Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned Salad
dressing"?\\
126 - Yeah, and we'll make it with
old-fashioneds.\\
127 - No.\\
128 - We'll sell more of it.\\
129 - Oh, come on, now, be serious.\\
130 - How are people gonna know that we're
selling it?\\
131 - Now, we've got to advertise.\\
132 - Yeah.\\
133 - Gee, isn't it too bad we haven't got
money enough\\
134 - to go on television?\\
135 - Yeah.\\
136 - Television!\\
137 - We'll go on television.\\
138 - Huh?\\
139 - I'll be a cooking expert.\\
140 - No, no, you'll be the cooking expert,\\
141 - and-and I'll be one of those women\\
142 - that they get up from the audience.\\
143 - I know just how they act.\\
144 - I've watched them a hundred times.\\
145 - So have I.\\
146 - I watch them every day.\\
147 - That's great.\\
148 - I know just what to do.\\
149 - What'll we use for money?\\
150 - What do we need with money?\\
151 - After all, who is my dearest friend\\
152 - in the whole wide world?\\
153 - Caroline Appleby.\\
154 - Caroline Appleby?\\
155 - Sine when did she get to be your
dearest friend?\\
156 - Since I just remembered\\
157 - that her husband runs a television
station.\\
158 - Oh, yeah.
Yeah.\\
159 - Do you think she'll go for the idea?\\
160 - I think so, especially if we cut her
in\\
161 - to the tune of, say, three cents a
bottle.\\
162 - Yeah, she likes that kind of music.\\
163 - Yeah.\\
164 - All she's got to do\\
165 - is get us on that Dickie Davis Show.\\
166 - He's on four hours every day\\
167 - and he sells all sorts of things.\\
168 - The Dickie Davis Show, yeah.\\
169 - Gee, I hope she'll do it.\\
170 - Just show her money and she'll do
anything.\\
171 - She is the greediest, the
penny-pinchingest...\\
172 - Caroline, darling, how are you, dear?\\
173 - Why, this is your old chum, Lucy.\\
174 - Thank you, thank you.\\
175 - That last number was brought to you\\
176 - by the Nelson Photo Finishing Company\\
177 - located on the corner of Leed
Boulevard and Hickox Avenue.\\
178 - Remember, the slogan\\
179 - of the Nelson Photo Finishing Company

343 - What?!\\
344 - Ethel and I are in business.\\
345 - We are bottling that good salad
dressing I make.\\
346 - Ay, que barbaridad.\\
347 - Mira que no saben lo que estan
haciendo.\\
348 - That's not true, whatever you said.\\
349 - We're going to make a million
dollars.\\
350 - Well, this is the most ridiculous
thing\\
351 - I've ever heard in my whole life.\\
352 - Why?\\
353 - There's lots\\
354 - of wonderful salad dressing in the
market\\
355 - made by people that know what they're
doing.\\
356 - Well, we know what we're doing.\\
357 - I should say!\\
358 - We've already got orders for 23 jars.\\
359 - At 40 cents a quart.\\
360 - 40 cents a quart?\\
361 - Yes, sir.\\
362 - That sounds awful cheap.\\
363 - How much does it cost to make?\\
364 - Oh... uh... um...\\
365 - Oh, um...\\
366 - Well, we didn't figure that.\\
367 - Oh, I see.\\
368 - Well, what did you figure?\\
369 - Well, we figured you'd just buy the
oil\\
370 - and the onions and stuff, and-and
sell it\\
371 - and what's left over is profit.\\
372 - Uh-huh, and what if there's nothing
left over?\\
373 - Well, there's got to be something
left over.\\
374 - How else can we make a million
dollars?\\
375 - Wait a minute.
Now wait a minute.\\
376 - Now let's figure this thing out.\\
377 - How-how much did you pay for all this
stuff?\\
378 - All of it?\\
379 - Yeah, all the stuff.
Come on.\\
380 - Well, $7.21 for the groceries.\\
381 - $7.21.\\
382 - Yeah.\\
383 - For the groceries.\\
384 - ETHEL: And $1.20 for the jars.\\
385 - $1.20 For the jars.\\
386 - LUCY: Ten cents for the labels.\\
387 - (sniffles)\\
388 - Ten cents for the labels.\\
389 - (sniffles)\\
390 - That's, um...\\
391 - (sniffles)\\
392 - (muttering)\\
393 - $8.31...\\
394 - (sniffles)\\
395 - and um...
how many jars are you making?\\
396 - Twenty-three.\\
397 - (tearfully): 23 jars.\\
398 - (sniffles)\\
399 - and, uh...
and you're selling it for what?\\
400 - 40 cents a quart.\\
401 - 40 cents a quart.\\
402 - (sniffles)\\
403 - (tearfully): 23 jars, 40 cents a
quart.\\
404 - Oh, now, get these onions out of
here!\\
405 - For goodness' sake.\\
406 - Now, let me see now.\\
407 - That's, uh... uh-huh.\\
408 - How much profit are we going to make?\\
409 - Three cents a jar.\\
410 - Three cents a jar?\\
411 - That three cents goes to Caroline.\\
412 - Yeah. Well, uh...\\
413 - maybe there is no profit on each
individual jar,\\
414 - but we'll make it up in volume.\\
415 - This I'd like to see.\\
416 - And let me tell you something else.\\
417 - LUCY: What?\\
418 - I didn't figure shipping, mailing,\\
419 - insurance, taxes or overhead.\\
420 - Oh, well, if you're gonna figure all
that stuff.\\
421 - Lucy.\\
422 - What?\\
423 - Come here.\\
424 - No.\\
425 - Look, I'm not gonna get mad.\\
426 - You're not?\\
427 - No.\\
428 - Well, all right.\\
429 - Now, at least you tried.\\
430 - Yes.\\
431 - Now, the thing for you to do\\
432 - is fill this 23 orders and get out of
business.\\
433 - Well...\\
434 - That way, I'll only lose\\
435 - seven or eight dollars.
Yeah.\\
436 - FRED: Lucy! Ethel!\\
437 - Yeah?
We're in here, Fred.\\
438 - FRED: I got your mail.\\
439 - Okay.\\
440 - (whispering)\\
441 - What's that?\\
442 - That's your morning mail.\\
443 - The morning mail?\\
444 - You're kidding!\\
445 - "Send me one quart of\\
446 - Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned Salad
Dressing."\\
447 - "Send me one quart of Aunt Martha's
Old-Fashioned..."\\
448 - "Send me one quart of Aunt Martha's
Old-Fashioned..."\\
449 - "Send me two quarts of..."\\
450 - LUCY: "Send me four quarts\\
451 - of Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned Salad
Dressing."\\
452 - "Send me one quart of Aunt Martha's\\
453 - Old-Fash..."\\
454 - They're all the same.
They're all orders.\\
455 - Well, how.. wh-where did this mail
come from?\\
456 - How do these people know about this?\\
457 - Um...\\
458 - uh, well, yesterday we did a spot\\
459 - on Charlie Appleby's television show.\\
460 - Well, there's two more sacks of mail
downstairs.\\
461 - Oh, no.\\
462 - Well, what's the matter?\\
463 - I thought you'd be glad.\\
464 - Uh, we just applied a little
arithmetic\\
465 - and we found out\\
466 - that they're losing money on every
jar.\\
467 - I thought it sounded too good.\\
468 - Hey, Lucy, look at all this mail.\\
469 - We must be terrific television
salesmen.\\
470 - Yeah. Oh, listen!\\
471 - Maybe we'd better go back on that
program\\
472 - and unsell that salad dressing,
and...\\
473 - and then maybe all these people\\
474 - will take back their orders.
Yeah.\\
475 - What are you talking about?\\
476 - Well, if we did such a good job of
selling yesterday,\\
477 - maybe we can go back on again and
unsell it today.\\
478 - Here I am again, Mary Margaret
McMertz.\\
479 - And today I'm going to demonstrate
the same product\\
480 - that I showed you yesterday.\\
481 - And to get an unbiased opinion,\\
482 - I asked an average housewife,\\
483 - picked at random from our audience\\
484 - just before we went on the air, to
come up here and help me.\\
485 - Uh, would you come up here,\\
486 - average housewife whom I picked at
random, please?\\
487 - How do you do?\\
488 - Hello.\\
489 - I am Mary Margaret McMertz.\\
490 - How do you do?\\
491 - And what is your name?\\
492 - What is your name?\\
493 - Huh?\\
494 - Your name, please?\\
495 - Oh, Lucille Mcgillicuddy.\\
496 - Oh, now, Mrs. Mcgillicuddy,\\
497 - you know why you're up here, don't
you?\\
498 - Huh?\\
499 - You know why you're up here, don't
you?\\
500 - I'm... No, I don't.\\
501 - Well, I want you to try\\
502 - some of Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned
Salad Dressing\\
503 - and tell these people what you think
of it.\\
504 - Oh, all righty.\\
505 - It's a mighty pretty color, isn't it?\\
506 - (bellows in disgust)\\
507 - Wow, wow!\\
508 - What's that?!\\
509 - Why, that's Aunt Martha's
Old-Fashioned Salad Dressing.\\
510 - Are you sure? Smell it.\\
511 - How about that?\\
512 - Looks like Aunt Martha had too many
Old-Fashioneds.\\
513 - What do you want me to do with it?\\
514 - Why, I want you to taste it.\\
515 - Taste it?\\
516 - Now, maybe that's a bad jar.\\
517 - You could say that again.\\
518 - Here, let's try another one.\\
519 - It's really delicious.\\
520 - All righty.\\
521 - What's Aunt Martha trying to do,
poison me?\\
522 - Friends, I can no longer endorse this
product.\\
523 - If you have ordered it, send in your
cancellations.\\
524 - Cancel, cancel.\\
525 - Phone to: Circle 7-2099\\
526 - or write to: 623 East 68th street.\\
527 - And do it now.\\
528 - FRED: Lucy! Ethel!\\
529 - The mail.\\
530 - Here it is!
Come on in!\\
531 - Here it is.
Open up.\\
532 - Look! Cancellations!\\
533 - It worked.\\
534 - Oh, boy.\\
535 - Oh, yes.\\
536 - Here.\\
537 - "Keep kidding the product.\\
538 - "It's wonderful.
Send me four jars."\\
539 - "Enjoyed your hilarious advertising
stunt on television.\\
540 - "Send me a jar of Aunt Martha's
Old-Fashioned Salad Dressing."\\
541 - "That's the American way to do
things--\\

555 - Is that the last one?\\
556 - Next to the last.\\
557 - Stick out your tongue.\\
558 - Thanks.\\
559 - Mine went dry 200 jars ago.\\
560 - (chuckling)\\
561 - 1,153 jars.\\
562 - Wow-wee.\\
563 - Come on, I'm tired.\\
564 - So am I.\\
565 - Whew!\\
566 - Hi, girls.\\
567 - Hi.	Hi.\\
568 - Listen, I got to feeling sorry for
you,\\
569 - so I got a whole assembly-line system
figured out.\\
570 - You can bottle this stuff in no time
at all.\\
571 - Well, thanks just the same, but we
have news for you:\\
572 - We're all finished.\\
573 - Come here.
Finished?\\
574 - So soon?\\
575 - My goodness!\\
576 - How did you do it?\\
577 - Oh, Lucy had a wonderful idea.\\
578 - Oh, it wasn't so much.\\
579 - We just went to the grocery store,\\
580 - bought 1,133 jars of salad dressing\\
581 - and pasted our labels on them.\\
582 - And it only cost ten cents more a
quart than ours.\\
583 - What?\\
584 - So we lost money.\\
585 - We'll spend the rest of our lives
making it up.\\
586 - Yeah, the main thing is,\\
587 - we're done with it.
Yeah.\\
588 - Are you?\\
589 - What do you mean?\\
590 - Well, you have to deliver this stuff.\\
591 - It's gonna cost you at least 20 cents
to mail it.\\
592 - Just a minute, dear.\\
593 - We have that all figured out.\\
594 - Come, Ethel Roberta.\\
595 - (knock on door)\\
596 - Oh, hiya, Fred.\\
597 - Hi, Rick. Did you tell them about our
plan?\\
598 - Yeah.\\
599 - What's this?!\\
600 - They don't need our plan.\\
601 - They went to the market store,\\
602 - they bought over a thousand and some
more jars of this stuff,\\
603 - they got their own labels, they
pasted it on,\\
604 - and they got it all finished.\\
605 - Pretty clever.\\
606 - I'm waiting here to find out how
they're gonna deliver it.\\
607 - Yeah, how are they gonna do that?\\
608 - I don't know.
Look, I gave up\\
609 - trying to outguess them a long time
ago.\\
610 - Where's my assistant?\\
611 - Well, you take the East Side, I'll
take the West Side,\\
612 - and I'll be in Jersey afore ye.\\

104 - 			Ethel!	\\
105 - Oh, I'm not gonna eat them.	\\

start throwing things.		\\
107 - If they use those brownies,	
they'll kill each other!	\\
108 -       Now, just a minute.	\\
109 - Nobody has to go anyplace.	\\
110 - 	    There's not going

116 - 	  and stay right here	     
     at home with my child.\\
117 - It's a boy, you know.		\\
118 - 		    (chuckles)\\
119 -     Oh! 	    I've heard. \\
120 - Isn't that wonderful!		\\
121 - Sit down,			 you

122 - Oh, honey,

123 - I'll go get			
Little Ricky.			\\
124 - He should be through		 with
his book by now.	   \\
125 - 	All right.		     
		   Book?   \\
126 -     Yeah, he likes to spend	 
about an hour with a good book \\
127 -     before he goes to sleep.	\\
128 - 	  Reading it?		\\
129 - 	No, tearing it. 	\\
130 - He sometimes eats a page or two.\\
131 - 	    Oh, you're crazy.	\\
132 - I'll be right back.		\\
133 -     (Ricky and Fred laugh)    \\
134 - Imagine that!			\\
135 - A whole week off		 with
nothing to do		   \\
136 - but just hang			
around the house.		\\
137 -      Yeah, I ought to take	   a
week off myself sometime.   \\
138 - 	From what?		\\
139 - You've been hanging around	    
the house for 23 years.     \\
140 -   I wish you'd take a week off	    
and go someplace!	    \\
141 - Has it only been 23 years?	\\
142 - Time to go, beddy-bye.		\\
143 - That's a fella. 		     
		   Aw...   \\

146 - Say good night			 to
Uncle Fred.		     \\
147 - 		Night, son.	\\
148 - Say good night to...		\\
149 - Well, look who's here!		\\
150 - Mr. Ricardo.			\\
151 - 	  How do you do, my boy!\\
152 - 		You know I heard     
	   a lot about you.\\
153 - 	    We're going to	     
       be spending a lot   \\
154 - 		of time together     
	   from now on.    \\
155 - (chuckles)		      \\
156 - Well, I'll tuck him in		 and
tell him his bedtime story. \\
157 - 	    Hey, let me do that.
Do what?			\\
158 - 	Tuck him in and tell him     
   his bedtime story.	   \\

165 - 	      "Little Red Ri..."\\
166 - 		Oh, yeah!	\\
167 - You sure you know it?		\\
168 - 	    Of course I know it.\\
169 - 	    My mother used to	     
       tell it to me	   \\
170 - 	when I was little child.
Oh.				\\
171 - 	 We have bedtime stories     
    in Cuba, too, you know.\\
172 - 	      You just rest	     
	 your mind at ease.\\
173 - Yes, sir.			\\
174 -      Come on, boy, come on.	\\
175 - 	 I'll tell you		  
your favorite bedtime story,  \\
176 -        "Caperucita Roja."	\\
177 -      Oh, isn't it wonderful	     
seeing them together?	   \\
178 -       Gee, you know, I...	\\
179 -  "Capuracita Roja," what's that?\\
180 - 	 I don't know.		\\
181 -      Maybe it's "Little Red	    
Riding Hood" in Spanish.    \\
182 - Oh, this I got to see!		\\
183 - 	      Can we come along?\\
184 - Sure. Come on, hurry up!	\\
185 - Oh, he's pushing the door	 for
Papa and everything.	    \\
186 -  Boy, you're a big, strong boy. \\
187 -      Come on, now, come on.	\\
188 - 	(grunts)	      \\
189 -     Now, you be a good boy.	\\
190 - 		     (fussing)\\
191 -      Shh... I'm gonna bring	    
your favorite toy.	    \\
192 - 	Here we go.		     
		(fussing)\\
193 -       Okay, look at this!	\\
194 -     Whoo!			\\
195 -     (giggling)		      \\
196 - 	    Come on!		\\
197 -   Okay, I'm going to tell you	  
your favorite bedtime story,  \\
198 -        "Caperucita Roja."	\\
199 -      Now, once upon a time,	\\
200 -  habia una muchachita muy bonita  que
le decian Caperucita Roja, \\
201 -       porque siempre tenia	     
    un red bonnet.	   \\
202 - 	Now, una manana,	  su
mama le dio un basket,	    \\
203 -       y en el basket puso	     
 frijoles, tortillas,	   \\
204 -   y tambien le puso alli vino.	\\
205 -   Y le dijo, "Caperucita Roja,	     
lleva este basket	   \\
206 - 	 "a tu granmama 	   
que esta en su casa y tu...  \\
207 -      y tu... granmama		     
 esta feeling lousy."	   \\
208 -       Caperucita Roja cogio	     
el basket y dice,	   \\
209 -     "All right, Mama, adios,	     
Mama," y se fue.	   \\
210 - 	  (humming)	      \\
211 -      Y entonces miro,		     
y alli estaba el lobo.	   \\
212 - 	  (growling)	      \\
213 - 	 Y el lobo dijo,	 
"Buenos dias, Caperucita Roja."\\
214 -        Y caperucita dijo,	   
"Buenos dias, SeÃ±or Lobo."   \\
215 - 	 Y el lobo dijo,	 
"Â¿Que tiene alli en el basket?"\\
216 -        Y Caperucita dijo,	     
  "Aqui en el basket	   \\
217 -      "Tengo frijoles,		     
tortillas y vino	   \\
218 -      "que se lo voy a llevar	     
      a granmama	   \\
219 -  que esta feeling lousy."	\\
220 -    Y el lobo dijo, "muy bien.	\\
221 -  Eh, Â¿porque no vas por el	  
jardin and pick some flowers?" \\
222 -        Y Caperucita dijo,	     
"All right, muy bien."	   \\
223 -      Y se fue por el jardin	     
 to pick the flowers.	   \\
224 -     (humming a happy tune)    \\
225 - (humming)		      \\
226 - 	  (humming)	      \\
227 -  Y entonces el lobo dijo,	  
"Aha! Granmama en la casa!" \\
228 -     Boom, boom, boom!		\\
229 -      Y granmama dice,		 
"Halo, quien esta alli?"       \\
230 - 	 Y el lobo dijo,	     
  "Caperucita Roja."	   \\
231 -  Y granmama dice, "Venga!	     
   Entra, entra!"	 \\
232 -  Y el lobo abrio la puerta	     
	y entro 	   \\
233 -       y estaba la granmama	     
      en la cama.	   \\
234 - (growling and eating noisily) \\
235 - (growling			 and
eating noisily) 	  \\
236 -       Mmm... mmm-mm, mmm!	\\
237 -     (smacking lips):		     
      Mmm...		 \\
238 - 	    Not bad!		\\
239 - 	     Mmm...		\\
240 -  Y entonces se metio en la cama   y
cogio el blanket y se cubrio.\\
241 -   Y Caperucita estaba por alla	     
     por el bosque	   \\
242 -       pickando the flowers.	\\
243 -     (humming a happy tune)    \\
244 -   Y llego a la casa de granmama      
  y abrio la puerta,	   \\
245 -  "Buenos dias, Granmama."	\\
246 - 	 Y el lobo dijo,	   
"Buenos dias, Caperucita."   \\
247 -  Y Caperucita dijo, "Granmama!	 
What big orejas tu tienes!"   \\
248 -       Y el lobo dijo, "Si!	  
Para oirte mejor, my dear."  \\
249 -  Y Caperucita dijo, "Granmama!	What
big ojos tu tienes!"	   \\
250 -       Y el lobo dijo, "Si!	  
Para verte mejor, my dear."  \\
251 -  Y Caperucita dijo, "Granmama!"\\
252 -       Que boca tan grande	     
     tu tienes!"	  \\
253 - 	 Y el lobo dijo,	    
"To eat you with!"	    \\
254 - 	(growls)	      \\
255 - 	  (screams)	      \\
256 -      (growls and screams)     \\
257 - (growls)		      \\
258 - (screams)		      \\
259 - 	(growls)	      \\
260 - 	  (screams)	      \\
261 -   Y entonces vino ya el hunter	\\
262 -      y el hunter hizo		     
boom, boom, boom!	   \\
263 -  Y el lobo se cayo muerto.	\\
264 - 	     Dead!		\\
265 - 	  Y Caperucita, 	     
 "Gracias, SeÃ±or Lobo.     \\
266 -        "Gracias SeÃ±or....	     
 SeÃ±or El Hunter.	     \\
267 -    Gracias por matar el lobo."	\\
268 -  Y el SeÃ±or Hunter dijo, "No hay  de
que, Caperucita Roja."	    \\
269 -      Y entonces se sentaron	     
 para comer el dinner	   \\
270 -   y se comieron las tortillas,	     
los frijoles y el vino	   \\
271 -       y todo el mundo vivio	     
 happily ever after!	   \\
272 - Now, good night, old man.	     
     Good night.	   \\
273 - Wasn't that cute!		\\
274 - 		     El lobo!	     
	Shh!		  \\
275 - 	  (growling)	      \\
276 - 		    Stop!	     
	       He was cute!\\
277 - 	(humming a happy tune)\\
278 -     Fred...			\\
279 - 	sit down.		 Sit
down.			    \\
280 - (chuckling)		      \\
281 - 	Well, how did it	     
       go dear? 	   \\
282 - Oh, fine,			 real
good.			   \\
283 -     Isn't it fun telling him	     
   a bedtime story?	   \\
284 - Oh, yeah. Did you see		 the
expression		    \\
285 - on his face			 when
I did el lobo?		   \\
286 - 		Yeah. Wasn't	     
	   that the cute...\\
287 - 	     What do you mean,	     
	did I see the ex...\\
288 - 	      Did you know	     
	 we were out there?\\
289 - (chuckling)		      \\
290 - Well, I didn't			 know
it all the time.	   \\
291 - At first I thought		 it
was mice,		     \\
292 - but I never heard		 a
mice giggle before.	      \\
293 - 		    (laughing)\\
294 - I didn't know you were there	 till
the very end.		   \\
295 - It's wonderful			
taking care of the baby.	\\
296 - Why don't you let me take	
complete charge while I'm home? \\
297 -       You mean everything?	\\
298 - Yeah, all day,			
everything.			\\
299 - 	     That means 	     
	getting up at 6:00.\\
300 - So? That's not so tough.	\\
301 - 	      Well, I don't know     
	 if you've noticed,\\
302 - 	 working nights and all,\\
303 - 	    but there's a 6:00	     
       in the morning, too.\\
304 - I know, I know. 		\\
305 - Now, look, starting		
tomorrow morning,		\\
306 - you don't have to worry 	
about anything. 		\\
307 - I'll get up and take care	 of
the baby,		     \\
308 - and you can stay in bed 	 and
sleep as long as you want.  \\
309 - 	Sleep as long as I want!\\
310 - 	    Oh, honey, that	     
       sounds so wonderful!\\
311 - 	    Isn't that great!	\\
312 - 	 Ricky! Ricky!		\\
313 - 	 Ricky! Ricky!		\\
314 -     Ricky, the baby's gone!	\\
315 - 	Ricky! Ricky... 	\\
316 - 	     RICKY:		  
Okay, my boy, are you ready	    
for your breakfast?	  \\
317 - 		    RICKY:	     
	       Yes, sir,   \\
318 - 		  nothing like a     
	     big breakfast!\\
319 - 	      Spanish omelet	     
	 with green onions,\\
320 - 		  green peppers      
	     and mushrooms.\\
321 - 	Spanish omelet! 	\\
322 -     Come on, you got to eat	     
 all of your oatmeal.	   \\
323 - All your oatmeal, come on.	\\
324 -      Come on. Then you grow	     
    big and strong	   \\
325 -     and you can have		    
a Spanish omelet,	    \\
326 -     like your old man.		\\
327 - 		Come on,	     
	   there you go.   \\
328 - 		  There you are.\\
329 -       Listen, we'd better	     
 put a napkin on you	   \\
330 - because if you get some...	\\
331 - 	RICKY:			     
   ...with that... oatmeal,	   
Mommy will get mad.	\\
332 - Don't you want any more?	\\
333 - Okay, you had enough.		\\
334 - Come on. We go get dressed	 for
the day, eh?		    \\
335 - We're gonna go out		 and
play football		    \\
336 - and we're gonna box		\\
337 - and we're gonna have		 a
wonderful time. Come on.      \\
338 - Up we go! Up we go!		\\
339 -   That's a boy! That's a boy!	\\
340 - 	Yes, sir!		\\
341 - 	      Shh!		\\
342 - We don't want to wake Mommy up. \\
343 -   This is the first good rest	
she's had in a long time.	\\
344 -       (snapping fingers)      \\
345 - 	(sighs) 	      \\
346 - 	  Lucy, will you stop	     
     pacing back and forth!\\
347 - 	     I'm getting a crick     
	in my neck.	   \\
348 - 	 Sorry, I guess 	     
I'm a little nervous.	   \\
349 -  After all, this is the first	 
time Ricky's had to take care  \\
350 -       of the baby all day	     
   all by himself.	   \\
351 - 		    Now, listen,     
	       Lucy.		     
  (meow)	    \\
352 - What's that?			     
	       What's what?\\
353 - I heard a cry.			     
	 Oh, wait a minute.\\
354 - 	    Oh, that was	     
       Mrs. Trumbull's cat.\\
355 - Are you sure?			\\
356 - 	  I am, unless		     
Little Ricky's sitting	   \\
357 - on the windowsill going "meow." \\
358 - Come on, sit down, relax.	\\
359 -       (nervous chuckle)       \\
360 - 	All right.		\\
361 -  Oh, go get your hat and coat.	\\
362 -      We're going shopping.	\\
363 -     Oh, yeah, I guess		    
it would be better	    \\
364 -     if I got away from here.	\\
365 - Sure. This is your big day off,      
   remember?		   \\
366 - Oh, yeah. I'm just being silly. \\
367 - I'll go get my things.		\\
368 - 		    Look, Ricky.\\
369 - 	 (squeaking)	       Hey,
Rick.			   \\
370 -     (laughing)		      \\
371 -     How about that?		\\
372 - 	How about that? 	\\
373 - 			Hi!	     
	 Hi!		   \\
374 -     Oh, hi.			     
	 How are you doing?\\
375 - Fine.				     
   Just fine.		   \\
376 -     Uh, Ethel and I thought	    
we'd go shopping.	    \\
377 - Fine.				     
     Good, honey, go ahead.\\
378 - 	     Uh...		\\
379 -     (toy squeaking)	      \\
380 - 	     He likes this	     
	horseback-riding	     
   business, you know?\\
381 -     Yeah, what a jockey 	    
he'd make.		    \\
382 -     (Ricky and Fred laugh)    \\
383 -   Who do you like in the fifth	     
   at Santa Anita?	   \\
384 - 	    (laughing)	      \\
385 -     If you'd rather I didn't	 go
shopping, I don't have to go.\\
386 - 	    Oh, now, honey, stop     
       being a worrywart.  \\
387 -       I'm not a worrywart!	\\
388 -       Well, you run along,	     
 we'll be just fine.	   \\
389 -       Say good-bye, Mommy.	\\
390 - 		      Okay, bye.\\
391 - Good-bye, Mommy.		\\
392 - 	    Bye-bye, darling.	\\
393 - Good-bye, Mommy.		\\
394 - 	    Bye-bye, darling.	\\
395 - Say "Bye-bye, Mommy."		\\
396 - 	    Bye-bye, darling.	\\
397 - Bye-bye, Mommy. 		\\
398 - 		Oh... baby.	    
Yeah.			    \\
399 - 		    Bye-bye.	    
Bye-bye,			
Mommy.			    \\
400 - FRED:				 Hey,
Rick.				     
	  Bye-bye.    \\
401 - 	Yeah?			
What's the matter		 with
this set?		   \\
402 -     Oh, I'll tune it, Fred.	\\
403 - Oh, I can fix it.		     
No, no, no, no, Fred.	   \\
404 - 	 Wait a minute. 	    
I'll do it, I'll do it.     \\
405 -       Let me do it, wait,	     
hold it. No, hold it.	   \\
406 - Wait a minute. This is		 a
very funny thing here.	      \\
407 - You got to know 		 how
to do it.		    \\
408 - FRED:				
Coming in now.			\\
409 - RICKY:				 It
is?			     \\
410 - Yeah, that's the game.		
There you are.			\\
411 - FRED:				
Well, get over there,		 sit
down, let's watch it.	    \\
412 - This is 			 the
big game, yeah. 	    \\
413 - 	  Oh, kickoff.		\\
414 - 	 Wow, wow, wow, 	    
what's he doing?!	    \\
415 - 		Well, I'm ready.\\
416 - I'm sorry I took so long.	\\
417 - I wasn't going to...		\\
418 -     Lucy, you going to look	    
like that all afternoon?    \\
419 - 	Probably.		\\
420 -       Now, listen, honey,	\\
421 -      you got to get used to	 
being separated from your son. \\
422 -  That's part of being a mother. \\
423 - 	  (sniffles)	      \\
424 - 	I don't see why.	\\
425 - Well... 			\\
426 - it just is.			\\
427 - Uh, first,			
he'll go to school,		\\
428 - and then he'll go away		 to
college,		     \\
429 - and then he'll get married	 and
leave home altogether.	    \\
430 - 	  (wailing):		     
 Oh... no!		 \\
431 - Oh, don't cry. He'll come home	 for
Thanksgiving and Christmas. \\
432 - 	      Oh.		\\
433 -  That is, if his mother-in-law	     
    doesn't mind.	   \\
434 - 	  (sobbing):		     
      Oh...		 \\
435 - Come on, you'll feel better	 when
we get in the stores.	   \\
436 - 	  (sniffles)	      \\
437 - Well, maybe you're right.	\\
438 - 			    Oh! \\
439 - 	    Oh, Little Ricky!	\\
440 - What was he doing		 in
the hall?!		     \\
441 - 	  That's what		    
I'd like to know!	    \\
442 - Honey, are you all right?	\\
443 - 		    Lucy!	     
   Honey...		   \\
444 - 	     What?		 Your
door's open!		   \\
445 - He must have crawled out	 and
they didn't even miss him!  \\
446 - 		Oh, no! 	\\
447 - 	 Oh, no, honey, sneak...\\
448 - 		sneak down and	     
	   close that door.\\
449 -     Okay.			     
       I've got an idea.   \\
450 -     (crowd applauding		     
and cheering on TV)	 \\
451 -     I closed the door.		\\
452 - Listen... listen,		 you
take care of the baby.	    \\
453 - I'm gonna give a certain	
absent-minded Cuban		\\
454 - a lesson he'll never forget.	\\
455 - 		  Okay. Come on      
	     here, darling.\\
456 - Yes, it's all right,		
sweetie pie.			\\
457 - 	    Come on, sweetie.	     
       Here we are.	   \\
458 - 	(phone rings)	      \\
459 - 	 Turn that down a little     
    bit, will you, Fred?   \\
460 - Yeah.				\\
461 - 	     Hello.		\\
462 - 	Oh, hello, dear.	\\
463 - 	 Oh, hi, honey. 	\\
464 -      Ethel and I were just	     
getting ready to leave	   \\
465 -     and I thought I'd check	  and
see how Little Ricky was.  \\
466 - Oh, honey, stop worrying.	\\
467 - 	He's fine.		\\
468 -     He's just... fine.		\\
469 - 	Oh, is he?		\\
470 - 	  Sure, sure.		\\
471 - Uh, well, uh, put him on, dear. \\
472 - I'd like to say good-bye to him.\\
473 - 		  Wait a minute!\\
474 -      Fred, where's Little Ricky?\\
475 - I don't know.			\\
476 - 	    Look in the bedroom,     
       will you?	   \\
477 - 		Little Ricky?	\\
478 - 	 Little Ricky!		\\
479 - 		Little Ricky?	\\
480 - He's not			 in
there, Rick.		     \\
481 - 		Uh... uh...	\\
482 - 	    Honey, Little busy's     
       Ricky right now.    \\
483 - 	  What's that?		\\
484 - 		 Little Ricky's      
	    busy right now.\\
485 -     Busy, doing what?		\\
486 - 	He's... watching the,	     
   the football game	   \\
487 -     with-with his Uncle Fred.	\\
488 - 	      Oh.		\\
489 - 	     Yeah, I'll have him\\
490 - 		call you right	     
	   after the game. \\
491 - 	      Gee, I didn't want     
	 to upset Lucy.    \\
492 - 	     Fred, where is he?!
	     Where is he?!	\\
493 - I haven't got him!		\\
494 -     He-he couldn't have left.	    
The door is closed.	    \\
495 - 	He's got to be in the	     
   apartment someplace.    \\
496 - Maybe he's hiding.		\\
497 -     Yeah, he's playing		    
hide-and-seek, that's it!   \\
498 - 		Little Ricky!	\\
499 - 	 Little Ricky!		\\
500 - 		Little Ricky!	\\
501 - Little Ricky!			\\
502 - 		Little Ricky!	\\
503 - 		Little Ricky?	\\
504 - Little Ricky!			\\
505 - 	 Little Ricky?		\\
506 - Olly olly outsenfree!		\\
507 - Little Ricky?			\\
508 - 	 Little Ricky?		\\
509 - 		Little Ricky!	\\
510 - 		 Fred, he must	     
	    have gotten out\\
511 - 		  in the hallway     
	     someplace.    \\
512 -     I'll go, I'll go get him.	\\
513 - I'll call the police.		\\
514 - Call the police, what for?	\\
515 -      Well, every time a kid	     
    wanders away,	   \\
516 -       you go down and look	     
in the police station,	   \\
517 -     and you find them there	
eating an ice-cream cone.	\\
518 -      Okay, call the police.	\\
519 - Hello-o-o!			\\
520 - Hello.				\\
521 - 	     I forgot my gloves.\\
522 - 	    Oh. 		\\
523 - 	Where's Little Ricky?	\\
524 -   Uh... he-he's taking a nap.	\\
525 - 	  Oh, another nap? He	     
     already had one, dear.\\
526 - I-I-I know, yeah, but his	
little eyes got very tired	\\
527 -   watching television, and he	  
wants to take another nap.    \\
528 -       Oh, well, maybe I'd better     
 take a look at him, then. \\
529 - 	    No! 		\\
530 -     Lucy...	    Why not?	\\
531 - 	  Uh, uh, uh,		     
     well, uh...	   \\
532 -     You see, his team lost,	    
and he's pretty upset.	    \\
533 -   That's right, yeah, his team	     
lost, he's very upset.	   \\
534 - 		     Oh, well...
	     Yeah.		\\
535 -     You-you run along, dear.	\\
536 - 		 No, no, I-I	     
	    think I'll wait\\
537 - 	    and see him 	     
       when he wakes up.   \\
538 -       I miss him, darling.	\\
539 - 			Oh.	\\
540 - I'd better go look		 at
the furnace.		     \\
541 - 		 Yeah, look	     
	    at the furnace.\\
542 - 	      It's cold in here.
	      Go ahead, Fred.	\\
543 - 		Good-bye.	\\
544 -      He, he, he might sleep	     
   for a long time.	   \\
545 -     He was very tired.		\\
546 - 	I'll wait.		\\
547 - 	      Oh.		\\
548 - Anything wrong? 		\\
549 - 		 Wha-Whatcha...?\\
550 - 	Nothing's wrong,	     
 everything is fine.	   \\
551 - I want to see my baby.		\\
552 - 		  Now, Lucy,	     
	     wait a minute.\\
553 - I don't like the way		
you're acting.			\\
554 - I'll bet he isn't		 even
in there.		   \\
555 - 		Now, honey...	\\
556 - 	     RICKY:		  
Now, honey, don't be silly.   \\
557 - He couldn't possibly be...	\\
558 - 	Aha!			\\
559 -     Aha.			\\
560 - 	He's here!		\\
561 -     I mean, he's here.		\\
562 -       Hel-Hel-Hello, son!	\\

564 - (under breath): 	       How
wonderful...		    \\

     come to Mama, darling.\\

	   Yeah?	   \\
572 - 		    He's gone!	     
     Who's gone?	   \\
573 - 	Uh... uh... uh, Fred.	\\
574 -       I can't find him anywhere.\\
575 -     Here I am!			\\
576 - Fred's here.			\\

       plays)		 \\
2 -     Ah...			\\
3 - And I'll tell you		
something else. 		\\
4 - It's impossible for me		 to
lose weight on a diet.	     \\
5 -      I know what you mean.	\\
6 - 			Me, too.\\
7 - 	    I tried.		\\
8 -   I diet for four or five days	\\
9 - and I lose an ounce or two	\\
10 -  and then I see a piece of cake      
 or pie and I'm dead.	   \\
11 - 		That's the story     
	   of my life.	   \\
12 - 	    Me, too.		\\
13 -      Ricky's been after me	\\
14 -      to lose a few pounds,	\\
15 -      but I just don't seem	 to
have the courage to...	     \\
16 - 	 Wait a minute. 	\\
17 - 	Look around you.	\\
18 - What's the matter?		\\
19 -       It's happened again.	\\
20 - 		    What has?	\\
21 -     The great divide.		\\
22 -     Same thing happens		  
every time we have a party.   \\
23 - 	Look here.		\\
24 -       You know, everybody	     
around the 18th green	   \\
25 - was gathered around there.	\\
26 -  You know, the whole membership     
of the Thunderbird Club     \\
27 - was around the 18th green.	\\
28 -   All I had to do was to make	\\
29 - this missly two-foot putt	 to
win, and I missed it.	     \\
30 - 	 Yeah. It's the "missly"     
    ones that get you.	   \\
31 - I'd rather try a ten-footer	 than
a two-footer		   \\
32 - any day in the week.		     
       I don't blame you.  \\
33 - 		It's all right.      
	   Don't blame you.\\
34 - 	     LUCY:		     
   See what I mean?	   \\
35 -     Women in one room,		    
men in the other.	    \\
36 - Well?				\\
37 - 	What do you mean	     
       "well"?		   \\
38 - 	  Why does it		     
 have to be that way?	   \\
39 -       Why aren't we all in here,     
 talking together?	   \\
40 - 	Give me one good reason.\\
41 - We're married.			\\
42 -   Well, we like talking about	 
babies and clothes and recipes \\
43 -      and they like to talk	
about sports and politics.	\\
44 - 	We're interested	     
 in different things.	   \\
45 - Sure. Just 'cause		
we're married to men		\\
46 - doesn't mean we've got		
anything in common.		\\
47 -     Don't you think this	    
situation is disgraceful?   \\
48 -     Oh, I don't know.		\\
49 - I've been going to parties	 ever
since I was married.	   \\
50 -      It's always like this.	\\
51 - Sure. I thought this is 	 the
way it was supposed to be.  \\
52 - 	  Well, I don't like it.\\
53 - 	Are we going to 	     
   continue to be sheep?   \\
54 - 			Well?	\\
55 - Baaah!				\\
56 - 		  Well, I'm not.\\
57 - 	    I want my husband to     
       pay attention to me.\\
58 - 			So do I.\\
59 - Okay.				\\
60 - 	    Come on.		\\
61 - Oh, frankly, I think		\\
62 - it's gonna be a good thing	 for
television.		    \\
63 - 	     Ricky.		     
   Bill.		   \\
64 - 	Fred.			\\
65 - 			Yeah?	     
	       Yes?	   \\
66 - 	Come on in here 	     
       with us. 	   \\
67 - 	Yeah.			    
Come on.		    \\
68 - 		    Okay.	     
		   Sure.   \\
69 - I'll be right in.		     
		   Sure.   \\
70 - 	How do you think	     
   color will take?	   \\
71 - Color?				\\
72 - Well, there are two schools	 of
thought on that matter.      \\
73 - Some people think, uh, well,	 it's
just around the corner.    \\
74 - Others feel it's gonna		 be a
year or two.		   \\
75 -      We didn't exactly		     
stampede the goats, did we?\\
76 - Maybe we'd better go down	 to
Abercrombie and Fitch	     \\
77 - and see if they sell		
goat-mating calls.		\\
78 - 	    You know, this is	     
       pretty insulting.   \\
79 - 	     Yeah.		\\
80 - 	I think so, too.	\\
81 - 	I'm going to do 	     
something about this.	   \\
82 - 		  Yeah. Come on.
Okay.				\\
83 -     No, I-I read an article	    
by Harry Ackerman.	    \\
84 - 	 He was talking 	    
about the color...	    \\
85 - 		      LUCY:	     
		 All right,	     
	    let's go. \\
86 - 	    ETHEL:		     
       Okay, Fred, break	     
  it up. Come on.     \\
87 - 	     RICKY:		     
 What are you doing?	   \\
88 - 	What's going on here?	\\
89 - 	     BILL:		    
All right, all right...     \\
90 - 	     What are you doing?\\
91 - All we're talking about 	 is a
little business.	   \\
92 - 		ETHEL:		     
	   Come in here,	     
      sit down...     \\
93 - 	What's going on 	     
	here?		   \\
94 - 		There you are.	\\
95 - 		Ethel, what's	     
	   eating you?	   \\
96 - 	    There. This is	     
       more like it.	   \\
97 - More like what? 		\\
98 - 	    More like the way	     
       it should be.	   \\
99 - I don't get it. 		\\
100 - Well, I'll explain it to you.	\\
101 -      We don't want you in there.\\
102 - 	    We want you in here.\\
103 -     Why?			\\
104 - 	  Because we're married.\\
105 - What are you trying to do,	     
   rub it in?		   \\
106 - 		    Fred!	\\
107 - 	    I know.		\\
108 - 	 It's the same		     
    old complaint.	   \\
109 - 	Lucy gets upset 	    
every time the men	    \\
110 -       go into another room	    
and talk to each other.     \\
111 - 		    Yes.	\\
112 - All right, we won't go		 into
another room		   \\
113 - and talk to each other		
anymore, dear.			\\
114 - 	    Well, that's better.\\
115 - We can talk			 to
each other in here.	     \\
116 - 	  Now, that's not funny.\\
117 -     Husbands and wives should	    
certainly find something    \\
118 - 		 to talk to each     
	    other about.   \\
119 - 			Why?	\\
120 - 		    Come on now.\\
121 - 	     Shall we give it	     
	the old-school try?\\
122 -     Okay.			\\
123 - 		(chuckles)    \\
124 - 	    (clears throat)   \\
125 - 		 Uh, I saw Tom	     
	    Williams today.\\
126 - Tom Williams?			     
		   Mm-hmm. \\
127 - 		Good old Tom.	     
	   How is he?	   \\
128 - 		Fine.		     
   That's good. 	   \\
129 - Mm, glad			 to
hear it.		     \\
130 - 		    Yeah, it's	     
	       nice to know\\
131 - 	    that good old Tom	     
       is feeling well.    \\
132 - 	Yes, sir.		\\
133 - 	  (chuckles)	      \\
134 - Uh, I asked him to come here	
tonight with his date.		\\
135 - 		 Oh, who is he	     
	    going with now?\\
136 - Oh, some model. 		\\
137 -     He has a different date	    
every week.		    \\
138 - 	    That's for sure.	\\
139 - 		You think	     
	   he'll marry her?\\
140 - 	    (chuckling):	     
	 No.		 \\
141 -   The last time I saw Tom was	 at
Madison Square Garden.	     \\
142 -     I think it was the night	  
that Charles fought Layne--   \\
143 - Walcott fought Layne,		
wasn't it?			\\
144 - 	  Yeah, I remember that,\\
145 - 	     only it wasn't with     
	Charles and Layne, \\
146 - 		  it was Charles     
	     and Walcott.  \\
147 -     Oh, you're right.		\\
148 - That was			 a
great fight.		      \\
149 - That's the second		
Charles/Walcott fight...	\\
150 -     Was a tremendous amount	    
of action, that fight.	    \\
151 - 	  You remember		     
 what the action was?	   \\
152 -       It was the worst fight	     
 I've ever seen in my life.\\
153 -     What are you		    
talking about?		    \\
154 -     He almost had him beaten	    
in the third round.	    \\
155 -     Aw, come on.		\\
156 -     Listen,			    
I'll tell you		    \\
157 -  one guy that could have beaten     
both Charles and Layne,     \\
158 -     and that's Louis.		\\
159 - No way. If you want		 to
go back, I'll tell you	     \\
160 - a guy who could have taken	    
Louis-- that's Dempsey.     \\
161 - If you really			 want
to go back,		   \\
162 -     I'll throw in you a guy	 that
could've taken both Dempsey\\
163 - and Louis at the same time.	\\
164 - 		Who's that?	\\
165 - Bob Fitzsimmons.		\\
166 - 			Oh...	     
   Are you kidding?	   \\
167 - Oh, what do you mean,		 am I
kidding?		   \\
168 - 			Yeah.	
That's the trouble		\\
169 - with you young punks.		\\
170 - You've never seen		 a
real fighter.		      \\
171 - 	Aw, now...		\\
172 - 		Well, we'll	     
	   see this one    \\
173 - 	he's bringing tonight,	     
   and then we'll find out.\\
174 - 	Oh, yeah.		    
Right.				 You
know... 		\\
175 - 	 Wait a minute. 	     
       Hold it. 	   \\
176 - 	      What's the matter?\\
177 - 	How does it feel	     
 to be a sheep again?	   \\
178 - Look around you.		\\
179 - Didn't take long for our party	 to
get back to normal, did it?  \\
180 - 	Oh, let's face it, Lucy.\\
181 -       We'll never gonna get them     
 out of the kitchen.	   \\
182 - Yeah, I guess			
you're right.			\\
183 - Well... 			\\
184 -       (doorbell buzzes)       \\
185 - Oh, that must be Tom.		\\
186 - Oh, Tom,			\\
187 - 	Hi, Lucy.		 I'm
so glad 		    \\
188 - you could come. 		     
   How are you? 	   \\
189 -     Nice to see you.		    
Hi, Ethel.		    \\
190 - 		    Hi, Lou Ann.\\
191 - 	    Sorry we're late,	\\
192 - 	    but Eve had to do	     
       a fashion show.	   \\
193 - Oh, that's quite		 all
right.			    \\
194 - 	Oh, uh, Eve Whitney.	     
   This is Lucy Ricardo.   \\
195 - 	 How do you do? 	\\
196 - Oh, how do you do, dear?	\\
197 - This is Mrs. Mertz.		     
	   Hello.	   \\
198 - 	 How do you do? 	\\
199 - Mrs. Hall.			     
   Hi.			   \\
200 - 	 How do you do? 	\\
201 - This is Ethel,			 Lou
Ann and Eve.		    \\
202 - May I have your wrap?		\\
203 - Oh, my, that certainly		 is
beautiful.		     \\
204 -       Thank you very much.	\\
205 - 		Um, where are	     
	   the fellas?	   \\
206 -  Oh, they're out in the kitchen      
   as usual.		   \\
207 - You couldn't pry them out	 of
there with a crowbar.	     \\
208 - 	     Come on in, Eve.	     
	I'll introduce you.\\
209 - 	     RICKY:		 
That guy in his prime could've	 
beat any one of those guys.   \\
210 - Hi, fellas.			\\
211 - 		 Oh, hello, Tom.
		    Hello, Tom. \\
212 - I'd like you to meet		 Eve
Whitney.		    \\
213 - This is Ricky Ricardo.		\\
214 -     How do you do?		\\
215 - 		  How do you do?\\
216 - And Fred Mertz. 		\\
217 - 	 How do you do? 	\\
218 -     How do you do?		\\
219 - Bill hall.			\\
220 - 		  How do you do?\\
221 -     How do you do?		\\
222 -     Well, I won't bother	    
you gentlemen.		    \\
223 - I'll join the girls.		\\
224 - 	Oh, uh... light?	\\
225 - 	Light?			\\
226 - FRED:				
Light?				\\
227 - BILL:				
Light?				\\
228 - Well, I'll say this for her,	 she
got them out of the kitchen.\\
229 - Yes. Apparently, all the old	
goats needed was a young kid.	\\
230 - 		Hi.		\\
231 - 	 Good morning.		\\
232 - What's good about it?		\\
233 - You're right. Bad morning.	\\
234 - Honestly, every time		 I
think about last night,       \\
235 - I get mad all over again.	\\
236 - 	    Me, too.		\\
237 - I haven't been such a wallflower\\
238 - since I was a foot taller than	 all
the boys in dancing school. \\
239 - 	    Did you notice	     
       the way Ricky acted?\\
240 - He wasn't any worse		 than
the rest of them.	   \\
241 - 		Oh, yes, he was.\\
242 - 	  He has a special line.\\
243 -      Did you ever notice, Ethel,\\
244 -     that whenever he's around	    
a good-looking girl,	    \\
245 - 	  he becomes more Cuban?\\
246 - 	 The prettier the girl,      
    the thicker the accent.\\
247 - That's right.			\\
248 - By the end of the evening,	\\
249 - I couldn't understand		 a
word he was saying.	      \\
250 - 	 Sounded like he had	     
    a mouthful of frijoles.\\
251 - Did you get a load		 of
Fred Mertz?		     \\
252 - I thought I'd die when he	
suggested playing post office.	\\
253 - 	  Well, it was certainly     
     a grim little evening.\\
254 - Oh, well, there's no use	
brooding about it.		\\
255 - When you're married,		
that's the way things are.	\\
256 - 	What do you mean "that's     
   the way things are"?    \\
257 - 	     That's what we	     
	thought last night.\\
258 - 	    And then Eve	     
       Whitney walked in   \\
259 - 	 and, suddenly, that's	     
    the way things weren't.\\
260 -     So? 			\\
261 - 	    So, maybe it isn't	     
       our husbands' fault.\\
262 - 	Maybe it's our fault.	\\
263 - 		Maybe we've been     
	   married so long,\\
264 - 	      we've been letting     
	 ourselves go.	   \\
265 - What do you mean by that?	\\
266 - 	  What's Eve Whitney got     
     that we haven't got?  \\
267 - 		    Nothing.	\\
268 -       We've got just as much as      
 she's got, only lots more.\\
269 - Yeah, but the lots more 	 is
in all the wrong places.     \\
270 - 	Ethel, what would	     
   you say if I told you   \\
271 -       you could be just as	     
 attractive as Eve Whitney?\\
272 - I'd say you've			
snapped your twig.		\\
273 -       Listen, Eve Whitney didn't     
 always look like that.    \\
274 - How do you know? You never	 saw
her before last night.	    \\
275 - 	    Because I heard her      
       talking to Bill Hall\\
276 - 	    when he cornered her\\
277 - 	 and insisted on hearing     
    the story of her life. \\
278 - How about that? 		\\
279 - 	 Wasn't that nauseating?\\
280 -     Oh...			\\
281 - Well, she told Bill Hall that	 she
went to a charm school.     \\
282 - 	 It did wonders for her.\\
283 - A charm school? 		\\
284 - 	    Yes, and this is	     
       the one she went to.\\
285 -     The very same one.		\\
286 - "Phoebe Emerson Charm School."	\\
287 - "What is your C.Q.?"		\\
288 - That means charm quotient.	\\
289 - "Come in and let us		 give
you a free analysis."	   \\
290 - You and I are going		 down
there, Ethel.		   \\
291 - 		We are? Oh,	     
	   I don't think...\\
292 - Well, honey, we can't go wrong	 with
a free analysis.	   \\
293 - 		That's right.	\\
294 -     You think they can make	    
a glamour girl out of me?   \\
295 - Sure. Says right here,		 "We
work miracles." 	    \\
296 - 		Well, thanks.	\\
297 - Oh, I meant on both of us.	\\
298 - Come on, let's make		 an
appointment.		     \\
299 - 	  No one here.		\\
300 - 	Gee, isn't this 	    
a beautiful place?	    \\
301 - 	      Lucy, I'm nervous.\\
302 - Well, so am I, dear,		\\
303 - but just try to act poised	 and
sophisticated.		    \\
304 - 		    Okay.	     
    Look at this.	   \\
305 - 		      Oh... boy.\\
306 - 	Ooh, look,		     
aren't they beautiful?	   \\
307 - 			Jiminy. \\
308 - LUCY:				 Oh,
she's really... 	    \\
309 - 	Good afternoon. 	\\
310 - 	Oh, hello.		
Hello.				\\
311 - 	     Aren't they lovely?\\
312 - 		 They're some of     
	    our graduates. \\
313 - Oh, really?			
They're very beautiful. 	\\
314 - I'm delighted to see you.	\\
315 -     I'm Miss Emerson.		\\
316 - Oh. How do you do?		\\
317 - I'm Mrs... uh...		\\
318 - Uh, this is Mrs. Mertz, 	 and
I'm Mrs...		    \\
319 - 		Mrs. Ricardo.	\\
320 - Mrs. Ricardo.			\\
321 - 		  How do you do?\\
322 -     How do you do?		\\
323 - 	I suppose you're here	     
   for the Emerson checkup?\\
324 - Well, is that			 the
free analysis?		    \\
325 - 	Yes, it's free. 	\\
326 - LUCY:				 Yes,
that's the one. 	   \\
327 -   We grade you in four points,	\\
328 - 		    and, uh, 100
Uh-huh. 	    is perfect. \\
329 - 	    And now if you'll	     
       step this way.	   \\
330 - All right.			\\
331 - 	Lucy... 		\\
332 - It's a lovely			
piece of furniture.		\\
333 - 	 Yes, isn't it. 	\\
334 - 	      Now, the first	     
	 point is the hair.\\
335 - 	     Will you please	     
	take off your hats?\\
336 -       Oh, dear, it must be	     
awfully windy outside.	   \\
337 - 		Here's a mirror.\\
338 - 	Why don't you fix it the     
   way it's supposed to be?\\
339 - 	Is that the way 	     
 it's supposed to be?	   \\
340 - 		    Yes, ma'am. \\
341 - 	      Oh.		\\
342 - 	Now for skin and makeup.\\
343 -      Hmm... your skin's not bad.\\
344 - 		 Not bad at all.\\
345 - Thank you.			\\
346 -      You're very well-preserved.\\
347 - 		 And your makeup     
	    is adequate.   \\
348 - 	      Do you always use      
	 that color powder?\\
349 -     Oh, I don't mean it the	    
way it sounds, of course.   \\
350 - It's just that, here, we strive  for
a fresh, natural look,	    \\
351 - and that powder gives you	  a
weird, very unnatural look.  \\
352 - 	      You know what	     
	 I mean, of course.\\
353 - I'm not wearing powder. 	\\
354 - 		Oh...		\\
355 -       Well, now for our posture.\\
356 - 	    (undertone):	     
     Posture.		 \\
357 -       Just stand the way	     
 you normally stand.	   \\
358 - 	Oh.			\\
359 - Now the next item is the voice. \\
360 -     Would you please speak,	     
   uh, Mrs. Mertz?	   \\
361 - 		    Uh...	\\
362 - 	    (clears throat)   \\
363 - 		(chuckles)    \\
364 - 	    What shall I say?	\\
365 - 	    Oh, anything at all.\\
366 - 	    Just give me your	     
       name and address.   \\
367 - 	I am Mrs. Ethel Mertz...\\
368 - 	and, uh, I live at	     
   623 East 68th Street.   \\
369 -     Uh, Mrs. Ricardo?		\\
370 -     I am...			\\
371 - (clears throat) 	      \\
372 -     I am...			\\
373 - Testing one, two,		
three, four, testing.		\\
374 - 		 Well, now we'll     
	    total these up \\
375 - 		 and see what	     
	    our scores are.\\
376 - 	    Out of a possible	     
       100 points,	   \\
377 - 		 you got 32,	     
	    and you got 30.\\
378 -      You know, I feel sure	     
our course could make	   \\
379 -       hundred percenters	     
 out of both of you.	   \\
380 - 			Yes.	     
		   Really? \\
381 -     It's unbelievable		    
what we can accomplish.     \\
382 - 	      Now, when would	     
	 you like to start?\\
383 - Oh, right away. 		\\
384 - With scores like ours,		
there's not a moment to lose.	\\
385 - 	You said it.		\\
386 - 		Well, then,	     
	   come with me.   \\
387 -     (knock at door)	      \\
388 -     All right, ladies,		     
    are you ready?	   \\
389 - 	     ETHEL:		     
     Yes, ma'am.	   \\
390 -     Ah. 			\\
391 - Now, the first thing		\\
392 - we're going to take up		 is
the matter of relaxing.      \\
393 - Tension is our			
greatest enemy today.		\\
394 - A charming woman		 is a
relaxed woman.		   \\
395 -   Now, a little beauty secret	\\
396 - is to take a few minutes	
every day and just relax.	\\
397 -     Relax completely.		\\
398 - Let yourself			 go
absolutely limp.	     \\
399 - Now, try it.			\\
400 - A little more. Much more.	\\
401 - More, more, more, more...	\\
402 - No, Mrs. Ricardo,		 not
that limp.		    \\
403 - 	No.			\\
404 - Like this.			\\
405 - This is just			 a
little trick		      \\
406 - for those days			\\
407 - when you have to be		 on
your feet all day.	     \\
408 - Now you try.			\\
409 -  That's right.			\\
410 - Now we'll work			 on
our walk.		     \\
411 - Let me see you walk.		\\
412 - 			    Up. \\
413 -     Up, up, up, Mrs. Ricardo.	\\
414 - 	 In an upright position.\\
415 -     Oh. 			\\
416 - 	      You go over there,     
	 Mrs. Mertz.	   \\
417 - 		    Okay.	\\
418 - 	      And now, I'll show     
	 you how to walk.  \\
419 - 	      You know, one	     
	 doesn't lump along\\
420 - 	    like a sack of meal.\\
421 - 		    Watch me.	\\
422 - 		One glides.	\\
423 -   Let the hips carry the body.	\\
424 -     The hips go first,		\\
425 -   and the body follows after.	\\
426 - 		Now you try,	     
	   Mrs. Ricardo.   \\
427 - The hips go first, huh? 	\\
428 - 		 That's correct.\\
429 - After you, hips.		\\
430 -     (knock at door)	      \\
431 - 	Come in.		\\
432 - 		    Hi, Rick.	\\
433 - Oh, hi, Fred.			\\
434 - What's new, old man?		\\
435 - 	    I don't know, oh,	     
       but something is.   \\
436 - 	Ethel told me to stay	     
   out of the bedroom	   \\
437 - 		  and wait for	     
	     her over here.\\
438 - Uh-oh. They must be cooking	
something together.		\\
439 - 		    Yeah.	\\
440 - Lucy won't let us		 in
our bedroom either.	     \\
441 - She says to wait out here	 for
a pleasant surprise.	    \\
442 - 		    Uh-oh.	\\
443 - Now, what do you think		 this
pleasant surprise could be?\\
444 -     Maybe they're leaving us.	\\
445 -     No, no.			\\
446 - 	Well, Ethel's been	     
   acting strange all week.\\
447 - So has Lucy.			\\
448 - 	    How can you tell?	\\
449 - That's a very good question.	\\
450 - LUCY:				
Yoo-hoo! Ricky! 		\\
451 -     Yes!			\\
452 - Close your eyes.		\\
453 - All right.			\\
454 -   You may open your eyes now.	\\
455 - May I have a light, please?	\\
456 - Thanks awfully, darling.	\\
457 -     Who is that?		\\
458 - 	     It looks like Lucy.\\
459 - 		    Lucy?	\\
460 -     Yes, darling?		\\
461 -     It is Lucy. 		\\
462 - 		    Well, what	     
	       do you know?\\
463 -       (doorbell buzzes)       \\
464 - Oh, that must be		 my
dear friend Ethel.	     \\
465 - Please, Fred.			\\
466 - I'll open the door.		\\
467 - 		Open it?	\\
468 - 	 I was going to lock it.\\
469 -       Oh, my dear fellow,	 you
have such a refreshing wit. \\
470 - 	     I hope		   I
didn't hold up the party.   \\
471 - Not at all, darling. Do come in.\\
472 -     Who's that? 		\\
473 - 		     Who's that?\\
474 - 		 What's that?	\\
475 - Oh, Ethel, darling,		 you
do look stunning.	    \\
476 - You look divine, darling.	\\
477 - Oh, Ethel, what is all this?	\\
478 - 		  Lucy, 'splain.\\
479 - "'Splain," darling?		\\
480 - Well, you ignored us,		\\
481 - so we knew you weren't happy	 with
us the way we were.	   \\
482 - So, we took an extensive course  at
Miss Emerson's Charm School. \\
483 - 	  Oh, so that's it, huh?\\
484 - Yes, that's it, darling.	\\
485 - Would you care to take		\\
486 - two charming strangers		 out
to dinner?		    \\
487 - Out to dinner?			\\
488 - 		    Uh, yes.	\\
489 -       That's a great idea, Fred.\\
490 - 	We can't waste all	     
   this charm here at home.\\
491 - Oh, thank you, darling. 	\\
492 - That's very,			 very
sweet of you.		   \\
493 - Uh, tell me dear,		
would you care			\\
494 - to go to see Mrs. Trumbull	 and
show her our gowns?	    \\
495 -       Well, just a minute.	     
   We-we-we can't,	   \\
496 -     we can't take out		    
two such gorgeous ladies    \\
497 -     dressed like this.		\\
498 - Oh. Oh, oh,			 of
course, darling.	     \\
499 - Uh, well, that's		 very
sweet of you.		   \\
500 - You go and change.		\\
501 - Come, dear,			
we'll show Mrs. Trumbull.	\\
502 - 	      Yes. Let's let her     
	 get a load of us. \\
503 - Did you ever see		
anything like that?		\\
504 - 	I was waiting for Ethel      
   to say "trick or treat."\\
505 - 		  Then you open      
	     your big mouth\\
506 - 	 and say something about     
    taking them to dinner. \\
507 - Wait a minute, Fred.		
Don't get upset.		\\
508 - I've got a plan.		\\
509 - She really did seem		 to
be impressed, didn't she?    \\
510 - Oh, they're not here.		     
		   Oh.	   \\
511 - 	  Well, we might as well     
     sit down and wait.    \\
512 - 	Okay.			\\
513 - 	    I can't sit down.	\\
514 - Neither can I.			\\
515 -      Well, we'll stand and wait.\\
516 - 	Yeah.			\\
517 - Ricky, darling, do hurry, dear. \\
518 - We're very hungry.		\\
519 - Just a minute!			\\
520 - Isn't that cute?		\\
521 - He wants to look so good.	\\
522 - 	    Fred never took	     
       so long to dress.   \\
523 -     He must be taking a bath.	\\
524 - Close your eyes!		\\
525 - 	Open your eyes. 	\\
526 - 	(gasps) 	      \\
527 - 	 Ricky Ricardo, 	     
 what are you doing?	   \\
528 -  I'm taking you out to dinner.	\\
529 -     Dressed like that?		\\
530 -  Well, what's wrong with this?	\\
531 - This is the latest thing	\\
532 - at the Little Gentlemen's	
Finishing School.		\\
533 - 	  Oh, Ricky...		\\
534 -       (doorbell buzzes)       \\
535 - That must be			 my
good friend Frederick.	     \\
536 -     Enter.			\\
537 - 	    Thank you, old chap.\\
538 -     Oh, good evening, ladies.	\\
539 - 	  I trust I haven't kept     
     you waiting, no?	   \\
540 - 	    Fred Mertz. 	\\
541 -     All right, fellas,		    
this isn't funny.	    \\
542 -     We thought you'd like us	    
looking like this.	    \\
543 -   We've been working like dogs	\\
544 -      going to charm school	     
    and exercising	   \\
545 -     and wearing mud packs...	\\
546 -     And plucking our eyebrows	    
and wearing chin straps.    \\
547 - All right, all right, we know	 what
you had to go through,	   \\
548 - but this is not for you.	\\
549 - This is not your style. 	\\
550 - This is phony.			\\
551 - 	     I thought you'd	     
	pay attention to me\\
552 -     if I was well-groomed and	    
charming and attractive.    \\
553 - I don't want you well-groomed,	
charming and attractive.	\\
554 - I want you the way you were.	\\
555 - 			What?	\\
556 - Oh, honey, I didn't mean it	 the
way it sounded. 	    \\
557 - I mean, I like you		 the
way you were.		    \\
558 - 	Yeah, Ethel, I even like     
   you the way you were.   \\
559 - Really? 			\\
560 - 			    Yes.\\
561 - Now come on, girls.		\\
562 - Let's go back			 the
way we were, huh?	    \\
563 -     You promise to stick	    
close to us at parties?     \\
564 - Like glue.			\\
565 - 	Well... okay.		\\
566 - 	Back the way		     
   we were?		   \\
567 - 		All right.	     
   Okay.		   \\
568 - 	    Back the way	     
       we were. 	   \\

1 - (I Love Lucy theme music

2 - 		    (screams) \\
3 -     Oh! 			\\
4 -     Ethel!			\\
5 -     Ethel, I'm sorry.		\\
6 - What are you trying to do,	     
    kill somebody?	   \\
7 - Oh, honey, I didn't know	 you
were there.		    \\
8 - 	Whew! What are you doing     
   with those things?	   \\
9 - This is what I'm giving Ricky	 for
our anniversary.	    \\
10 - 			    Oh. 
Aren't they wonderful?		\\
11 - 		 Oh, aren't	     
	    they beautiful?\\
12 - 	Gee. What are the little     
   booties on there for?   \\
13 - Booties? Those are covers	 to
protect the clubs.	     \\
14 - 	     Oh. What do	     
	those numbers mean?\\
15 - Oh, Ethel,			
don't you know anything?	\\
16 - Those numbers tell you		\\
17 - how many strokes		 to
take with that club.	     \\
18 - 	      Gee, that's a	     
	 wonderful present.\\
19 - Oh, I-I think he's going	 to
be crazy about it.	     \\
20 - 			 Uh-huh.\\
21 - I got to put it away, though.	\\
22 - Sure wouldn't			 want
him to see it.		   \\
23 - 		    Uh-uh.	\\
24 - 		I don't think	     
	   he'll see that. \\
25 -     No. 			\\
26 - 	Oh, boy.		\\
27 - Now comes my yearly problem.	\\
28 - 		    What's that?\\
29 - Well, trying to figure out	 a
way to give Ricky	      \\
30 - an inkling that 		 it's
our anniversary 	   \\
31 - without his knowing		 he's
being inkled.		   \\
32 - 	      Oh, that shouldn't     
	 be difficult	   \\
33 - 	     for an old, veteran     
	inkler like you.   \\
34 - I know, but it's always 	 such
a strain		   \\
35 - thinking up new ways		 to
remind him.		     \\
36 - You don't suppose,		 just
this once,		   \\
37 - he might remember		 all
by himself, do you?	    \\
38 - What was that for?		\\
39 -     Uh, wh-what was what for?	\\
40 - That expression on your face.	\\
41 - 	Uh, uh.... uh, I have	     
   a little indigestion.   \\
42 - Now, Ethel, cut that out.	\\
43 - You know something.		\\
44 - 	  No, I don't.		     
     I don't know anything.\\
45 - 		    I'm a dunce.\\
46 - You're keeping			
something from me.		\\
47 - 	    Uh, uh, well, uh,	\\
48 - 	    see you later, Lucy.\\
49 - Ethel Mertz, you're		 not
going anywhere		    \\
50 - until you tell me		 what
you know.		   \\
51 - Ricky remembered		 my
anniversary, didn't he?      \\
52 - 	I guess it wouldn't hurt     
   to tell you that much.  \\
53 - 		    Yes, he did.\\
54 - Oh, good.			\\
55 - 		  Well, so long.\\
56 - Ethel! You know 		 more
than that.		   \\
57 - Come on now.			 What
did he tell you?	   \\
58 - He must have talked to you.	\\
59 - He must have asked your advice	
about my present.		\\
60 - What did he want to know?	\\
61 - What size I wear?		\\
62 - What color I look best in?	\\
63 - How big a diamond		 I
like in a ring? 	      \\
64 - 	    I'm not going to	     
       say another word.   \\
65 - Ethel, I'm going to ask you	 just
one more question	   \\
66 - and then you can go.		\\
67 - Do you know what Ricky is	
giving me for our anniversary?	\\
68 - 		    Yes, I do.	\\
69 - What is it?			 What
is it?			   \\
70 -  I thought you were only gonna	 ask
me one more question.	    \\
71 -     I am. What is it?		\\
72 - Oh, I've already told you	\\
73 -       more than I should.	\\
74 - 	I told you he remembered     
   your anniversary,	   \\
75 - 	and I told you I knew	     
   what he was getting you.\\
76 - You'd think you'd be satisfied. \\
77 - You'd think so, wouldn't you?	\\
78 - 		Yes, I would.	\\
79 - Has he already bought it?	\\
80 -       Am I gonna like it?	\\
81 - 	 He bought it weeks ago,\\
82 - 	     you're gonna be	     
	thrilled to pieces,\\
83 -     and let go of my arm	    
before it's eight feet long.\\
84 - 	     Well!		\\
85 -       Now, can I step down	     
off the witness stand?	   \\
86 - 	     Okay.		\\
87 - 	 See you later. 	\\
88 - Hey, wait a minute.		\\
89 - Come here.			\\
90 - If he bought it weeks ago,	\\
91 -      it must be hidden here	     
    in the house.	   \\
92 - Where is it? Where is it?	\\
93 - 		I'm not gonna	     
	   tell you.	   \\
94 - Ethel, please,			
just-just tell me		\\
95 - if I... if I'm getting		
close to it.			\\
96 - Just tell me if I'm warm.	\\
97 - 	  No, I won't.		\\
98 -       Ethel, you tell me,	 or
I'm going to tell Fred	     \\
99 -     that you've been saving	     
out of the food money	   \\
100 - 	to buy yourself 	    
that monkey fur jacket.     \\
101 - 	 I'll tell him		\\
102 -  you've been sewing roast beef	    
bones on a chuck roast.     \\
103 - 	    You wouldn't dare.	\\
104 - Oh, wouldn't I? Hmph!		\\
105 - 	I'm going.		\\
106 - 		    I'm going	     
	       to tell him.\\
107 -       I'll count to three.	\\
108 - 	     One...		\\
109 - 	     two...		\\
110 -       two-and-a-quarter...	\\
111 - 	    two-and-a-half...	\\
112 -      Oh, Ethel, I just got	 to
know about my present!	     \\
113 -       Now come on, please!	\\
114 - 	     Just tell me if I'm     
	hot or cold, huh?  \\
115 - Just tell me, please.		\\
116 -      Please? Please, Ethel?	\\
117 - 		     Okay. Cold.\\
118 - 	Cold.			     
		Cold. Cold.\\
119 - 			Cold.	\\
120 - 		Oh, freezing!	     
	   Freezing.	   \\
121 - 		     Uh, warmer.\\
122 - 		     Uh, wa...	     
		Oh, warmer.\\
123 - 			 Warmer.\\
124 - 		Wa... Oh, wha...\\
125 - 		    Oh, you're	     
	       boiling hot!\\
126 -     If it was a snake,		     
 it'd bite your knee!	   \\
127 - 	      Ow!		\\
128 - 	      Oh!		\\
129 - 	     Oh, thank goodness,     
	it's gift-wrapped  \\
130 - 	  so you can't untie it.\\
131 -      Oh, can't I? I can get	 the
meat out of a sausage	    \\
132 - without touching the skin.	\\
133 - 		 Oh, I shouldn't     
	    have done it.  \\
134 - 		  I shouldn't	     
	     have told you.\\
135 - 	     I tried not to	     
	tell you, didn't I?\\
136 -     (gasps)		      \\
137 -     Oh! Ethel!			\\
138 - 	 I've already seen them.\\
139 - 	  Aren't they beautiful?\\
140 - Oh, my gosh!			\\
141 - Oh, Ethel!			\\
142 - 	  They're stone martens.\\
143 - 	 Stone martens! 	\\
144 - 			 Uh-huh.\\
145 - 	      Oh!		\\
146 - Ethel Mertz, you make me so mad.\\
147 - 	 What did I do? 	\\
148 -   You told me about my present	\\
149 -  and now I won't be surprised.	\\
150 - Look at that snowman.		\\
151 - Aw, look at the picture 	\\
152 - of Mommy and Daddy		 on
their honeymoon.	     \\
153 - Look at that, honey.		\\
154 - 		See the snow?	\\
155 - 	    Look at the snow.	\\
156 - 		      See Mommy?\\
157 -     Look at that.		\\
158 - 			Hi.	\\
159 -     Oh, hi, darling.		\\
160 - 	 Say, what are you doing     
    up so late, old man?   \\
161 - Oh, he was such a good boy,	 I
let him stay up 	      \\
162 - to say good night to Daddy.	\\
163 - 	      Oh, good. 	     
	 Hello, sweetheart.\\
164 - 	     How are you? Hello.\\
165 - Come on. Beddy-bye.		\\
166 - 			Okay.	\\
167 - You were a good boy, eh?	\\
168 - Oh, he was wonderful.		\\
169 - 	    Well, there you are.\\
170 - He even ate all 		 of
his spinach today.	     \\
171 - Well, listen, you're gonna	 grow
up to be a big, strong boy.\\
172 - 	      You'll probably be     
	 a football player.\\
173 - He's awful tired now, though.	\\
174 - Come on, honey. 		\\
175 -       Come on, sweetheart.	\\
176 - I let him stay up too late.	\\
177 - 		    Ah...	     
		 (crying)\\
178 - Well, it's all right,		
sweetheart.			\\
179 - 	Now say your prayers.	\\
180 - Gee, honey, don't those pictures
bring back a lot of memories?	\\
181 - You know, it's wonderful	 how
many great times we've had. \\
182 - 		    Yes, sir.	\\
183 - 	Say, we have an 	     
   anniversary coming up   \\
184 - 	      one of these days,     
	 haven't we?	   \\
185 -     Yeah.			\\
186 - 	Well, I'll pick up a box     
   of candy or something.  \\
187 - Oh! Oh-ho-ho!			\\
188 - 	  Hey-hey, look at that.\\
189 - 	  That's the night	     
     before we got married.\\
190 - 		  LUCY: 	     
	     Gee, that's	     
	a cute couple.\\
191 - 	      I wonder what ever     
	 happened to them. \\
192 - 	      Haven't you heard?\\
193 - 	     They lived 	     
	happily ever after.\\
194 - (chuckles)		      \\
195 - We have had fun,		
haven't we, honey?		\\
196 - 		    Yes, sir.	\\
197 - 	These have been the best     
   15 years of my life.    \\
198 - 	      What's the matter?\\
199 - We've only been 		
married 13 years.		\\
200 - 	     Oh. Well, I-I mean,     
	it seems like 15.  \\
201 -     What?			\\
202 - 	No, uh, what I meant is,\\
203 - 	it doesn't seem possible     
   that all that fun	   \\
204 - 	 could have been crammed     
    into only 13 years.    \\
205 - Well, you wormed		 out
of that one.		    \\
206 - Besides, it isn't even		 13
years until tomorrow.	     \\
207 -      All right. What do you want     
to do on our anniversary?  \\
208 - Do? You have to work.		\\
209 - 		No, I don't.	\\
210 - I'm gonna take the night off.	\\
211 -     I've already arranged it.	\\
212 - I don't believe it!		\\
213 - 		    It's true.	\\
214 -     Now, what do you want to do?\\
215 - 	  I'll take you anyplace     
     you want to go.	   \\
216 - Well... you know		 what
I want to do?		   \\
217 - 			What?	\\
218 - You won't laugh at me?		\\
219 - 			No.	\\
220 - I want to have a quiet		
little dinner at home,		\\
221 - just the two of us,		\\
222 - you know, candles		 and
champagne		    \\
223 - and our favorite records	 on
the phonograph. 	     \\
224 - 	    Oh, honey, that	     
       sounds wonderful.   \\
225 - Doesn't it?			\\
226 - A cozy, romantic		
dinner for two			\\
227 - just like it was		 on
our honeymoon.		     \\
228 - It'll, it'll just be		 our
night, huh?		    \\
229 - 	    Okay, sweetheart.	\\
230 -   If that's what you want to do,  
that's just what we'll do.    \\
231 - 	    Fred, guess what.	\\
232 -     What?			\\
233 -     The maitre d' from the	    
Tropicana just called me.   \\
234 - 	  Our surprise party	     
     tomorrow night is off.\\
235 - Well, it's their anniversary,	
isn't it?			\\
236 -     Yes, it's their anniversary,\\
237 - 	  but Ricky's decided	     
     to take the night off.\\
238 - 	How do you like that?	\\
239 - 	    He's worked every	     
       Tuesday night	   \\
240 - 	  since we've known him.\\
241 - Well, in that case, we'll just	 have
to phone all the people    \\
242 - and tell them we're gonna	 have
the party here. 	   \\
243 - 	     If the Ricardos are     
	going to be here,  \\
244 -     we'll have to find that out.\\
245 - 	     Let's go over there     
	and see, huh?	   \\
246 - All right.			\\
247 - 	    Come on.		\\
248 - 		    Hey...	     
   Yeah?		   \\
249 - 	  This is the night that     
     we went to the Copa.  \\
250 -     Oh, yes.			\\
251 - 	      Didn't we have fun     
	 that night?	   \\
252 - 	     Oh, I had forgotten     
	that dress.	   \\
253 - Oh, for heaven's sake.		\\
254 - 		Wait a minute.	     
	   Who's that?	   \\
255 - Where? Oh, that's		 Fred
and Ethel.		   \\
256 - 		 Fred and Ethel?\\
257 - Yeah. Haven't you seen that?	\\
258 - Ethel gave it to me.		\\
259 - That's when			 they
were first married.	   \\
260 - 		(guffawing)   \\
261 -   (laughing uncontrollably)   \\
262 - 	Hi.			\\
263 - 		What's so funny?\\
264 - (laughing harder)	      \\
265 - 		 How about that?
		 Fred with hair.\\
266 - Yeah, I remember		 when
this was taken. 	   \\
267 - But who's the slim,		
young girl with me?		\\
268 - 	Oh, now, Fred, I haven't     
   changed that much.	   \\
269 - Now, Ethel, as my hair thinned,  your
hips spread.		   \\
270 - 			Oh, poo.\\
271 - Come on, we've all changed	    
quite a bit since then.     \\
272 - 		I guess so.	     
	   Yeah, let's talk\\
273 - 	    about something	     
       a little pleasanter.\\
274 -     Sit down, come on.		 Sit
down.			    \\
275 - 		      All right.\\
276 - 	 Uh, Ricky, uh, 	    
what are you going to do    \\
277 - 	 tomorrow night 	     
 on your anniversary?	   \\
278 - Oh, uh, I'm going to		 take
the night off.		   \\
279 - 	    You are?		\\
280 - Yeah.				     
       Oh.		   \\
281 -      Well, uh, what are you	     
     going to do?	   \\
282 - 		Well, uh,	     
	   Lucy wants to...\\
283 - Uh, we have to...		 we
have to go out to dinner.    \\
284 - Uh, a business dinner.		\\
285 - 	      ETHEL:		     
	 A business dinner?\\
286 - Uh-huh, yes. They called	 just
before you came in.	   \\
287 - Uh, Ricky wanted		 to
turn them down, 	     \\
288 - but I wouldn't let him. 	 It's
too important.		   \\
289 -       Well, who's it with?	\\
290 - Rodgers and Hammerstein.	\\
291 - 		Rodgers 	     
	   and Hammerstein?\\
292 - 	    Rodgers		     
   and Hammerstein?	   \\
293 - Rodgers 			 and
Hammerstein?		    \\
294 - Uh, see? He's still surprised.	\\
295 - He can't even believe it,	 can
you, dear?		    \\
296 - 	No... no. It's, it's	     
   very hard to believe.   \\
297 - 	Well, um... uh, 	     
   I guess we got to go.   \\
298 - 	We got something to do.      
       Yeah, we got to go. \\
299 - 		Come on, Fred.	    
Why do you have 		 to
go so soon?		 \\
300 - 	  Yes, we have		     
   something to do.	   \\
301 - 	 but we'll see, 	     
 we'll see you again.	   \\
302 -     Don't have to run.		\\
303 - LUCY:				 See
you guys later. 	    \\
304 - 	What's all this 	    
about a business dinner?    \\
305 -     Well, I'm sorry,		\\
306 -  but I-I just didn't want them	\\
307 -       to know that we were	     
    gonna be home.	   \\
308 -  I wanted to be alone with you. \\
309 - 	Okay, honey, but why	     
   Rodgers and Hammerstein?\\
310 - Well, nothing but the best	 for
my husband.		    \\
311 - If you're gonna have dinner	 with
somebody,		   \\
312 - might as well have it		 with
Rodgers and Hammerstein.   \\
313 - 	     Now this is a mess.\\
314 -       We've got a whole surprise     
 party full of people	   \\
315 - 	 and nobody to surprise.\\
316 - Oh, there must be some way	 to
figure this out.	     \\
317 -     I don't think it'll work.	\\
318 - Of course it will.		 Why
not?				     
	   Look.       \\
319 - 	Well, the Mertzes always     
   know when we're home.   \\
320 - So, we'll go out.		\\
321 - 	 Well, that doesn't make     
    sense, even for you.   \\
322 - Look, we'll go out		 and
make a lot of noise	    \\
323 - so that they'll know		
we're leaving,			\\
324 - then we'll sneak quietly in	
through the kitchen door	\\
325 - and have our own		
little celebration.		\\
326 - 		Well... 	\\
327 -     Please.			\\
328 - Fred, I've got it.		\\
329 -     I'll see you later. 	\\
330 - Well, where you going?		\\
331 -     I'm gonna see Mrs. Trumbull.\\
332 - 	If they're going out,	     
   they'll have to get	   \\
333 - 	Mrs. Trumbull to stay	     
   with the baby.	   \\
334 - 	    And if Mrs. Trumbull     
       tells them	   \\
335 - 	    that she can't	     
       baby-sit after 9:00,\\
336 -       they'll have to come home,     
 and we can have our party.\\
337 - Ethel, you're slicker		 than
slippery elm.		   \\
338 -       Well, honey, I don't know.\\
339 - Oh, please, Ricky? Please?	\\
340 - Just for me.			 It
means so much to me.	     \\
341 - 	      Okay, we'll do it.\\
342 - Okay, honey, thank you! 	\\
343 - 		(whistling)   \\
344 -     Ricky?			\\
345 - 		    Yeah, honey.\\
346 - Mrs. Trumbull said		 she
could baby-sit until 9:00,  \\
347 - so I told her			 we'd
be back then.		   \\
348 - 		(chuckles)    \\
349 - Oh, gee,			
doesn't this look nice? 	\\
350 - This is gonna be the nicest	
anniversary we've ever had.	\\
351 - 	    Say, uh, what are we     
       having for dinner?  \\
352 - The same thing we had		 on
our first anniversary.	     \\
353 - 	    Raw potatoes	     
       and burned roast?   \\
354 - Oh...				\\
355 - Aw, come now. I've learned	\\
356 - to cook a little better 	
since then.			\\
357 -       Yes, you have, sweetheart.\\
358 - 	      What about opening     
	 our presents, huh?\\
359 - Oh, not now, honey.		\\
360 - We have to make like we're	
leaving first, remember?	\\
361 - 		    Okay.	    
Come on.		    \\
362 - 		    Ready?	    
Yeah.			    \\
363 - 	    Stay right there.	 All
right.			    \\
364 - 	     Uh, hurry up, dear!\\
365 - 	     We mustn't be late!\\
366 - 	 We mustn't keep	     
    Dick and Oscar waiting!\\

371 - 	  It's Ethel.		     
She's coming in here.	   \\
372 -   Get-get-get my, uh, stole--	\\
373 -   it's in there on the chair--	     
     and my bag.	   \\

 Hey, Lucy, open up!	   \\
376 - 	  Okay. Uh...		\\
377 - Uh, well, I-I-I'd		 ask
you in, Ethel,		    \\
378 - but, uh, we're			 kind
of in a rush.		   \\
379 -     Well, I just want to see how    
you look in your new dress. \\
380 - Oh, well, I'll come out there.	\\
381 - The light's better in the hall. \\
382 - 		    Oh, Lucy!	\\
383 - 		Oh, that's	     
	   just beautiful. \\
384 -     Thank you.			\\
385 - 	  Oh, my. Gee, it's nice     
     you're having dinner  \\
386 - 		with Rodgers	     
	   and Hammerstein,\\
387 -      but it's too bad it had to      
happen on your anniversary.\\
388 - Yeah, well, business		 is
business, you know.	     \\
389 - 			Yeah.	     
	Uh...		   \\
390 - 	Thank you, dear.	\\
391 - It's all right. 		\\
392 - 			Oh, boy.\\
393 -     Thanks very much.		\\
394 - Well, we'll see you later.	\\
395 - 	 Okay. Have a good time.\\
396 -     You're a handsome couple.	\\
397 - Thank you.			     
       Thank you, honey.   \\
398 - 	Thank you.		     
		       Bye.\\
399 - Bye				     
	       Bye.	   \\
400 - Oh, Fred what are you		
doing here?			\\
401 - They could have seen you.	\\
402 -  Oh, they've gone, haven't they?\\
403 - This ought to be a good time	 to
get things set for the party.\\
404 - No, we got to wait till they get in
the taxi and drive away.     \\
405 - They might have forgotten	
something and come back.	\\
406 - 		    Oh. 	     
   Oh,			   \\
407 - everything's just		
working out perfectly.		\\
408 - They're gonna be		 the
most surprised people.	    \\
409 - In the whole world.		\\
410 -     (giggling)	      Shh!    \\
411 - I feel like a burglar.		\\
412 - 	We made it.		\\
413 - 	Give me your coat.	\\
414 - We're all alone.		\\
415 - Happy anniversary,		
darling.			\\
416 - 	      Happy anniversary,     
	 sweetheart.	   \\
417 - Now for the presents.		\\
418 - 	    Okay. You sit	     
       right down there.   \\
419 - 	Okay.			\\
420 - Gee, I can hardly wait		 to
see what it is. 	     \\
421 - 		(chuckling)   \\
422 - Oh! Don't tell me it was	
hidden there all this time.	\\
423 -     Oh! 	    Yeah.	\\
424 - For heaven's sake.		\\
425 - 		(chuckling)   \\
426 -     Happy anniversary, honey.	\\
427 - Oh, thank you, dear.		\\
428 - Gee, I can't imagine what it is.\\
429 - Is it a... nightgown?		\\
430 - Um... a sweater?		\\
431 - Um... some candy?		\\
432 - Oh! Oh, Ricky!			\\
433 - Oh, furs!			\\
434 - 	Oh, honey!		\\
435 - Oh! They're just		 out
of this world.		    \\
436 - 		  You like them?\\
437 - Oh, honey, they're wonderful.	\\
438 -     Oh, gee.			\\
439 - 	I hope they're the right     
   color and everything.   \\
440 - Oh, honey, the color		 is
perfect.		     \\
441 - You should see how they look	 with
my new gray dress.	   \\
442 - 	I mean... uh... 	\\
443 -     they ought to look good	    
with my new gray dress.     \\
444 - I mean, I ought to see		\\
445 - how they look			 with
my new gray dress.	   \\
446 - I ought to keep 		 my
big mouth shut. 	     \\
447 - 	    Lucy, you peeked.	\\
448 - Well... yes, kind of... 	\\
449 - but I love them.		\\
450 - I've loved them 		 for
a whole day.		    \\
451 - 		But I wanted you     
	   to be surprised.\\
452 - Oh, I was,			 when
I found them.		   \\
453 - 		    Okay.	\\
454 - Now for your present.		\\
455 - 		    All right.	\\
456 - Close your eyes.		\\
457 - 		    Why?	
Well, it was			 too
big to wrap.		    \\
458 - 		  Oh, all right.
    Okay?			\\
459 - 		(chuckles)    \\
460 - Open your eyes. 		\\
461 - 		    Golf clubs!     
Yeah.			    \\
462 - 		 Oh, honey, just     
	    what I wanted. \\
463 -     Really?			\\
464 - 	  Oh, they're beautiful!\\
465 - They're all matched,		
whatever that means.		\\
466 - And there are four woods	 and
there are eight irons	    \\
467 - and there's			 the
most wonderful...	    \\
468 - What happened?			
Where is that?			\\
469 - Let's see. One, two, three,	
four, five, six, seven. 	\\
470 - That's funny.			\\
471 - One of them's missing.		\\
472 - 		Are you sure?	\\
473 - Yeah, I'm positive.		\\
474 - Th-The putter is gone.		\\
475 - 	You sure?		\\
476 - Yeah. Maybe it dropped		 out
of the bag in here.	    \\
477 - Now, where could that be?	\\
478 - 		    Hey, honey? \\
479 - 		    Honey!	\\
480 - 	    Le-Let's open the	     
       champagne, honey.   \\
481 - 	You'll find it later.	     
   Don't worry, come on.   \\
482 - Well, I can't			
understand that.		\\
483 - 	     They're beautiful.      
	Don't worry, honey.\\
484 - How could it drop		 out
of the bag?		    \\
485 - Four woods and one,		 two,
three, four,		   \\
486 - 	  five, six...		\\
487 - Now, where in the world did...? \\
488 - 	 (whistling)	      \\
489 - 	     Ricky!		\\
490 - Oh, you found the putter.	\\
491 - I told you you'd find it, sure. \\
492 - Ricky, where did this		 come
from?			   \\
493 - 		    The putter? \\
494 - Yes, the putter.		\\
495 -  Where did the putter come from?\\
496 - Yeah, where did the putter	 come
from?			   \\
497 - Well, um... if you must know,	\\
498 - 	     I found the golf	     
	clubs in the closet\\
499 - while you were at Ethel's and	 I
was practicing with the putter\\
500 -      and you came back and I had     
to hide it under the couch.\\
501 -     Oh, Ricky, you're		    
as bad as I am. 	    \\
502 - 	     Worse.		\\
503 -     Happy anniversary,		    
fellow peeker.		    \\
504 - 	      Happy anniversary,     
	 sweetheart.	   \\
505 -     Oh. 			\\
506 - 	(doorknob jiggling)   \\
507 - 	ETHEL:			     
   Oh, it's locked.		   
Go get the key, Fred.	\\
508 - 		The Mertzes?!	\\
509 - They're trying			 to
get in here.		     \\
510 - 		What do we do?	    
Hide.			    \\
511 - 		    Where?	 In
the closet.		     \\
512 - 		    All right.	\\
513 - 		 I'll take this.\\
514 - Here, take these things, too.	\\
515 - 	    Okay, I'll		     
       take the candles.   \\
516 - 	  Ah, ha, ha!		\\
517 -     There we are.		\\
518 -     Ah, where do I put this box?\\
519 - Uh, just put it down there	 on
the divan.		     \\
520 - 		    All right.	\\
521 - Ooh, they must have		 been
playing Scrabble.	   \\
522 - 		    Yeah.	 That
saves us		    putting
up the table.		\\
523 - 	Well, for once, 	     
   we kept a secret.	   \\
524 - 	    They're really gonna     
       be surprised.	   \\
525 - Hey, look at these.		\\
526 - 		Yeah, Lucy got	     
	   those for Ricky.\\
527 - Ain't they beauties?		     
	       Uh-huh.	   \\
528 - 			  ETHEL:     
		     Uh... \\
529 - 	I suppose you know	     
   what those numbers mean.\\
530 -     What?			\\
531 - 		They tell you	     
	   how many strokes\\
532 - 	 to take with that club.\\
533 - What idiot told you that?	\\
534 - 		    Lucy.	\\
535 - Well, that figures.		\\
536 - 	 Now, come on,		 you
didn't see the present	    \\
537 -      we're giving them, did you?\\
538 - No. I'd like to see it. 	\\
539 -     Okay, I wanted to show it	\\
540 -   to you before I wrapped it up.\\
541 - 	     I'm crazy about it.\\
542 - Oh, that's			 a
good-looking lighter!	      \\
543 - 	Yeah.			     
	   Uh-huh.	   \\
544 - Well, you could've at least	
taken the price tag off...	\\
545 - 	$32.50! 		\\
546 - Have you lost your mind?	\\
547 -       That's not the real price.\\
548 -     I erased the real price	    
and wrote that on myself.   \\
549 - 	Oh.			\\
550 -     Well...			\\
551 - what is the real price? 	\\
552 - 		    $4.95.	\\
553 - Come on now,			
let's not be too cheap. 	\\
554 - 	     Cheap? We're giving     
	them champagne	   \\
555 - 	and cake and a party.	\\
556 - Yeah, that's right.		\\
557 -       Besides, look who's	     
 talking about being cheap.\\
558 - 	  Ricky bought Lucy furs     
     for their anniversary.\\
559 - 	      I've always	     
	 wanted a fur coat.\\
560 - Now, listen, honeybunch.	\\
561 - If nature had intended		 for
you to have a fur coat,     \\
562 - you'd have been born with one.	\\
563 - 		Oh, honestly.	\\
564 - 	  Well, I'd better	     
     tidy up the room, huh?\\
565 -     Yeah. But...		\\
566 -   Now, don't open that bottle	     
    of champagne!	   \\
567 -      It'll just sit around	     
    and get flat.	   \\
568 - Don't worry. I won't let it	 just
sit around and get flat.   \\
569 - Now, Fred,			 give
me that champagne.	   \\
570 - 		    Come on now.\\
571 - 		Help me set the      
	   table, will you?\\
572 - 	All right.		\\
573 - 	    Pick the cake up.	\\
574 - 		 Put that there.\\
575 - 		    Got it?	\\
576 - 	Yeah.			\\
577 - 		Heavy, isn't it?\\
578 - Yeah, but it looks good.	\\
579 - 	      Mm-hmm. Isn't that     
	 a beautiful cloth?\\
580 - 	Uh-huh. 		\\
581 - 	     ETHEL:		  
Now, put the cake back down.  \\
582 - 	     FRED:		     
   All right.		   \\
583 -       Now, paper napkins.	\\
584 -       They're in that box.	\\
585 - Get them for me, will you?	\\
586 - 		    Yeah.	\\
587 - And bring their glasses.	\\
588 - They're prettier than ours.	     
	       All right.  \\
589 - 	Thanks. 		\\
590 - 	You're welcome. 	\\
591 - 	     Fred?		\\
592 - 	     Yeah?		\\
593 - 	     ETHEL:		    
How did you get out here	 in
the kitchen so fast?	 \\
594 - 	     FRED:		    
Well, I walked out here.       What's
the matter with you?   \\
595 - 	Well, you just handed	     
   me these napkins	   \\
596 - 	    and the minute I got     
       my hand on them,    \\
597 -      you said, "You're welcome."\\
598 - I didn't just hand you		 the
napkins.		    \\
599 -      What do you mean you didn't     
just hand them to me?	   \\
600 - Well, I mean that I just	
didn't hand you the napkins.	\\
601 - 		 Now, listen,	     
	    I ought to know\\
602 - 	whether you handed me	     
   these napkins or not.   \\
603 - 	Are you insinuating	     
   that I'm daft, loony,   \\
604 - 		 off my rocker,      
	    out of my head?\\
605 - Well, that covers it		
pretty well, yeah.		\\
606 - 	     One of us is loony.\\
607 - 		Oh, well.	\\
608 - Let's straighten		
these out.			\\
609 - 		Okay. Oh, that	     
	   looks all right.
    Yeah.			\\
610 -   Now, you go out in the kitchen  
and get the cake plates,      \\
611 - and I'll go in the bedroom	    
to see if it's all right    \\
612 -     so the guests can leave	     
their hats and coats.	   \\
613 - 		    Cake plates.
		    Cake plates.\\
614 -       (doorbell buzzes)       \\
615 - Hi. Come on in. 		\\
616 - They're not here yet.		\\
617 - They'll be here pretty soon.	\\
618 - Well, they said they'd		 be
here at 9:00, you know.      \\
619 - I-I was sure they'd have	 to
be back by then.	     \\
620 - It's 10:00 now. 		\\
621 -     (mouthing words)	      \\
622 -     Well, we just have		    
to wait a while longer.     \\
623 -     Just be patient.		\\
624 - What was that?! 		\\
625 -       It was out in the kitchen.\\
626 -     It's a champagne bottle!	\\
627 - What?!				\\
628 - 		    ETHEL:	     
	       It exploded.\\

33 - 	Oh, Fred,		 do
you have to fix it now?      \\
34 - 	 Can't you wait 	     
till after breakfast?	   \\
35 - Do you want it fixed		 or
not?			     \\
36 - 	All right.		\\
37 - 	    What's the matter	     
       with everybody?	   \\
38 -     Everybody's so grumpy	    
every morning around here.  \\
39 - 			Grumpy?!\\
40 - Who's grumpy?!			\\
41 - 	  Never mind.		\\
42 - 	  What are you		     
    going to have?	   \\
43 - 			  Bacon.\\
44 -     I'll have an egg.		\\
45 - 			Okay.	\\
46 - I'll swap you half of my egg	\\
47 - for half of your bacon. 	\\
48 -     Well, that's a sneaky way	    
to get bacon and eggs.	    \\
49 - 	(phone rings)	      \\
50 - 	     Hello?		     
       (raucous creaking)\\
51 - 	  Hello? Who?		     
	       (rattling)\\
52 - 	 Hello, Jerry.		     
	     (clattering)\\
53 - (clanging)    What?	      \\
54 -   Hold it a minute, will you?	\\
55 - I'm trying to talk on the phone.\\
56 - Will you hold it a minute?	\\
57 - 	 I'm trying...		\\
58 - 	Hold it, please.	\\
59 - 	    Hold it.		\\
60 - 		    (banging) \\
61 - 	 (shouting):		     
     Hold it!		 \\
62 - Well!				\\
63 -     And he says we're grumpy.	\\
64 -     Yeah.			\\
65 - Yes, Jerry, what would you like?\\
66 -     I got you all set		    
for an interview	    \\
67 -       with Eleanor Harris,	    
the big magazine writer.    \\
68 - 	Oh?			\\
69 - Yeah. She wants to do an article\\
70 -   on a really happily married	    
couple, you know,	    \\
71 -     like you and Lucy.		\\
72 - 	Oh.			\\
73 -     Yeah, she wants to spend	    
an entire day with you--    \\
74 -     you know, take pictures	     
   and everything--	   \\
75 -       right from the time	 you
get up in the morning.	    \\
76 - Good idea.			 When
does she want to start?    \\
77 -  Well, how about this morning?	\\
78 - You'd better wait		 till
tomorrow morning.	   \\
79 - We'll be more			
happily married then.		\\
80 -  Okay. Well, see you tomorrow,	     
   7:00 a.m.		   \\
81 - 	Okay.			\\
82 -     Oh, and Rick, she wants	     
     to catch you	   \\
83 -   just the way you really are.	\\
84 - So, don't make any preparations      
   for this.		   \\
85 -   Okay, we'll be just the way	     
 we are all the time.	   \\
86 - 	Good-bye.		\\
87 - 	    (raucous creaking)\\
88 - 	 Wait a minute, 	     
    wait a minute.	   \\
89 - 	 Hey, hey, hey! 	\\
90 - A magazine writer is coming over     
   tomorrow morning	   \\
91 - to do an article on you and me. \\
92 - 			Oh?	\\
93 -       Yeah. She's, she's	     
 gonna do an article	   \\
94 - 	  on a couple		 of
happily married people.      \\
95 -     What time is she coming?	\\
96 - 	     7:00.		\\
97 - 	In the morning?!	\\
98 - Yeah!				\\
99 - 	     Ew...		\\
100 - The idea is that she wants	  to
come early in the morning,  \\
101 -   see, and take some pictures	  and
see us exactly as we are.  \\
102 -       (doorbell buzzing)      \\
103 -       (doorbell buzzing)      \\
104 -       (doorbell buzzing)      \\
105 - Good morning.			\\
106 -     Hi, Lucy. This is		    
Eleanor Harris. 	    \\
107 -     Lucy Ricardo.		\\
108 - How do you do?			     
	   How do you do?  \\
109 - Nice to know you.		
Won't you come in?		\\
110 - 		Well, thank you.\\
111 - 	  This is an awful thing     
     to do to anybody,	   \\
112 - 	    barging in at this	     
       hour of the morning.\\
113 - 		I hope you don't     
	   mind too much.  \\
114 - Not at all.			\\
115 - We love company,		
especially in the morning.	\\
116 - Won't you sit down?		\\
117 - 			Thanks. \\
118 - 	Well, I can see 	    
that you two kids	    \\
119 -      are going to get along	     
 together just fine.	   \\
120 - Oh, certainly, Jerry.		\\
121 -     Well, I'll be running along.
All right.			\\
122 - 	    I think I'll go home     
       and go back to bed. \\
123 - 	Good-bye, Jerry.	\\
124 -   Well, uh, what should we do	     
	first?		   \\
125 -   Oh, don't pay any attention	     
	to me.		   \\
126 -     You just go ahead and do	\\
127 -     whatever you'd be doing	    
if I weren't here.	    \\
128 - Oh. Oh, well, then I'll 	 go
ahead and get breakfast.     \\
129 - 		    Fine.	 What
would you like? 	   \\
130 - 	    Oh, thanks. I've	     
       already had mine.   \\
131 - Oh, all right.			\\
132 - Pardon me.			\\
133 - Uh, Mrs. Ricardo, do you	
always dress like that		\\
134 - when you're			
getting breakfast?		\\
135 - 	 Oh, certainly. 	\\
136 -      I-I don't like to wear	     
    my good things	   \\
137 - just puttering around the house.\\
138 - Uh, hold it.			\\
139 -      Good morning, darling!	\\
140 - 		 Oh, sweetheart,     
	    good morning.  \\
141 - 	    Angel...		\\
142 - 		 You handsome...\\
143 - Hold it!			\\
144 - Oh, I didn't know		 we
had company.		     \\
145 - 		  Yes. Yes, this     
	     is Miss Harris\\
146 -      who came to do the magazine     
interview, remember?	   \\
147 - 	    Oh, yes.		     
    How do you do?	   \\
148 - How do you do, Mr. Ricardo?	\\
149 - I hope you don't mind		\\
150 - our starting the interview	 so
early.			     \\
151 -       Oh, no, not at all.	\\
152 - 	 We don't mind, 	     
     do we, dear?	   \\
153 - 	    Not at all, dear.	\\
154 - 		 Won't you	     
	    sit down, dear?\\
155 - 	Thank you.		\\
156 - Did you have a nice sleep,	     
       darling? 	   \\
157 -  Oh... yes, I slept like a top. \\
158 -     I awoke refreshed		  
and with a song on my lips.   \\
159 -   (singing "Vesti La Giubba"	    
from Pagliacci )	   \\
160 - 		  Here's to you,     
	     sweetheart.   \\
161 - Oh, no. 			
Here's to you, darling. 	\\
162 -      Oh, say, that's cute.	     
       Hold it. 	   \\
163 -       That's fun. Thanks.	\\
164 -      Um, what are we having	  
for breakfast this morning?   \\
165 -      Oh, the usual things:	\\
166 -      waffles with sausages,	    
omelets with ham,	    \\
167 - 	eggs Benedict-- 	    
take your choice.	    \\
168 -  Well, it's so hard to decide.	\\
169 - 	     You know, Lucy	     
	spoils me terribly.\\
170 - Oh...				\\
171 - 	You know, I-I...	\\
172 - She's such a good manager	\\
173 -      with the small amount	 of
money that I give her.	     \\
174 - 	 I-I don't see		    
how she does it at all.     \\
175 -     Oh, darling, now,		  
anyone could run a household  \\
176 - on the generous allowance	 
that you give me every month.  \\
177 - 		Thank you, dear.\\
178 - 	Well, I'll just 	     
   have something		   
simple this morning--	\\
179 - 	something like, uh...	     
   bacon and eggs.	   \\
180 - Okay.				\\
181 - 		     Well, okay.\\
182 - Hold it!			\\
183 - 		Good morning!	\\
184 -     (affected): 		   I
brought back the	      
half-and-half I borrowed.   \\
185 - 	    Oh, I didn't know	     
       you had company!    \\
186 - 	Yes, yes, Ethel.	\\
187 - 	Uh, Miss Harris,	     
 this is Mrs. Mertz.	   \\
188 - 	  How you do?		 How
you do? 		    \\
189 -   I'm the landlady and Lucy's	    
best friend Ethel Mertz.    \\
190 - 	M-e-r-t-z.		\\
191 - Well, Ethel, thanks a lot	    
for bringing back	    \\
192 - 	 (affected):		  
the half-and-half,	    \\
193 -     but see you later, huh?	\\
194 - 	    Huh, honey? 	\\
195 - 		    Hi, folks.	\\
196 - 	    How's the little old     
       leaky faucet?	   \\
197 -      Well, if it isn't the	 
Beau Brummell of the plumbers. \\
198 - 	Well, Lucy, I didn't	     
   know you had company.   \\
199 -      Uh, yes, Miss Harris,	\\
200 -     this is Mr. Mertz,		     
   M-e-r-t-z.		   \\
201 - 		How do you do?	\\
202 - How do you do?			\\
203 -     I suppose you two		     
 have had breakfast.	   \\
204 - No, we haven't. 		     
	   No, we haven't. \\
205 - 	 Uh, you don't want	     
    to eat with us, do you?\\
206 - Oh, yes, we'd love to.		\\
207 - Oh, that's marvelous.		\\
208 - I can get a picture of you	 with
your neighbors. 	   \\
209 -     A picture!			\\
210 - 	Oh, gosh, if I had known\\
211 - 	    I was gonna have	     
       my picture taken,   \\
212 - I'd have dressed up a little.	\\
213 -     How do you want us to...?	\\
214 - Oh, just something informal.	\\
215 - 		    All right.	\\
216 -     (band tuning up)		     
      What?		 \\
217 -     I can't hear you.		\\
218 -       All right, that's...	\\
219 - 	 Wait a minute. 	\\
220 - Hold it, fellas, will you?	\\
221 - Just hold it for a minute.	\\
222 - 	 What was that? 	\\
223 -     Yeah. Well, look,		\\
224 -     as long as the costumes	     
       get here 	   \\
225 - in time for the show,		
that's all I'm interested in.	\\
226 - Okay, well, thank you very much.
	Good-bye.		\\
227 - Hi, Ricky.			     
	   Oh, hi, Jerry.  \\
228 - Hey, where's Eleanor,		 the
magazine gal?		    \\
229 - 	 She's still with Lucy.      
    She'll be here tonight.\\
230 - 	Oh.			\\
231 - (groaning)		      \\
232 - (exhales)		      \\
233 -   What are you so tired about?	\\
234 - What am I so tired about?	\\
235 - You see these			
grubby little hands?		\\
236 - 		    Yes...	\\
237 - Well, these little		
pinkies of mine 		\\
238 - have become ink-stained 	 and
all cramped		    \\
239 - just so that you could become	 a
star of the first magnitude.  \\
240 - 		    What?	\\
241 - Here. Cast your great, big,	
shoe-button eyes on that.	\\
242 -       "Dearest Minnie, how about     
 a date Saturday night?    \\
243 - 	  "Will you meet me	     
     at the Tropicana Club?\\
244 - 		 Ricky Ricardo."\\
245 - Now, what would you think	 if
you got a postcard like that?\\
246 -     I would think I'd better go     
and see my physio-chiatrist.\\
247 - No, no, I mean, 		 if
you were a woman.	     \\
248 -      I think you'd better go and     
see your physio-chiatrist. \\
249 - 	  Come on, what is this?\\
250 -     "To Minnie Finch,		 1433
Tudor Street, Bronx."	   \\
251 - Looks like my signature, too!	\\
252 - I copied it.			
Pretty good, huh?		\\
253 - 	Too good, boy. Watch it.\\
254 - 	    Come on, what is it?\\
255 -      Don't you get it, Dad?	\\
256 - 	It's brilliant. 	\\
257 - I sent one of these cards	     
    to every woman	   \\
258 - on the Tropicana mailing list-- \\
259 - 	 3,000 of them. 	\\
260 - 		3,000?! 	    
Yeah.			    \\
261 - Boy, Saturday night		\\
262 - this joint is gonna be		
overflowing with women. 	\\
263 - Pretty good, huh?		\\
264 - 	Well, it'd better be.	\\
265 - No, no, you keep that one	 as a
souvenir.		   \\
266 - I made it out twice by mistake. \\
267 - Hey, come on. I'll buy you	 a
cup of coffee.		      \\
268 - 	    All right.		     
       Take ten, fellas.   \\
269 - 		You know, Jerry,     
	   there are times \\
270 -       when I think you're crazy,\\
271 -     and there are other times	    
when I'm sure of it.	    \\
272 - 	    Really?		\\
273 - Well, that was			 our
first meeting,		    \\
274 - and then a couple months	
later, we said "I do,"		\\
275 - and we've been happily		
married ever since.		\\
276 - 		    Mm-hmm.	\\
277 -       All right, now I'd like to     
 get a few quotes from you.\\
278 - All right.			\\
279 - Tell me, what's it like being	
married to an entertainer?	\\
280 - Oh, it's very exciting. 	\\
281 - After all, there's no business	 like
show business.		   \\
282 - You may quote me.		\\
283 - 		    Fine.	\\
284 -   I, um, I suppose you and Ricky  
had your share of arguments?  \\
285 - Ricky and me?			 Oh,
heavens, no.		    \\
286 - 	      Oh, come on, Lucy.\\
287 - 	Surely you have a little     
   tiff now and then?	   \\
288 - Tiff? Now, you may not		
believe this, Eleanor,		\\
289 - but Ricky and I have		
never tuffed.			\\
290 - Taffed? 			\\
291 - Tiffled?			\\
292 - 		      (laughs)\\
293 - 	     Oh, it's marvelous.\\
294 - 	  You're not the jealous     
     type, then, hmm?	   \\
295 - Well, what is there		 to
be jealous about?	     \\
296 -     Well, after all, Ricky is	    
a handsome, charming man    \\
297 - 	 surrounded by showgirls     
    all the time.	   \\
298 - Well... 			\\
299 - 	And he is out every	     
   night in a nightclub.   \\
300 - But that's his job.		\\
301 - 	    The last person	     
       that told me that   \\
302 - 	    was the wife of a	     
       famous piano player.\\
303 -       He told her that he was at     
 rehearsal every afternoon.\\
304 - And he wasn't?			\\
305 -     He was playing all right,	    
but not the piano.	    \\
306 - My goodness, she'd been 	
married to a man like Ricky,	\\
307 - she wouldn't			 have
had to worry.		   \\
308 - When he says he's at rehearsal,  he's
at rehearsal.		   \\
309 - 	May I quote you on that?\\
310 - Oh, sure, sure. 		\\
311 - 	    Well, I guess that's     
       the kind of trust   \\
312 - 		that's made your     
	   marriage last.  \\
313 - 		    Isn't it?	\\
314 -     Hmm?			\\
315 - 	    I said, that's	     
       the kind of trust   \\
316 - 		that's made your     
	   marriage last.  \\
317 - Yeah, that's			 the
kind of trust		    \\
318 - that you have to have		
in-in that kind of...		\\
319 - in any kind of a marriage.	\\
320 - 		    All right.	\\
321 - 	Now, how long have	     
   you two been married?   \\
322 - Hmm?				\\
323 - 	I said, how long have	     
   you two been married?   \\
324 - 13 Years.			
Would you excuse me?		\\
325 - I want to look at the baby.	\\
326 - 	Well, yes, certainly.	\\
327 -     Hello. Tropicana?		\\
328 -     I'd like to speak		    
to Mr. Ricardo, please.     \\
329 - 	  (sighing)	      \\
330 - 	Hello, Rick...? 	\\
331 -      Oh. Oh, he isn't there	     
   right now?		   \\
332 -       Do you have any idea	    
where he might be?	    \\
333 -      You don't. Well, uh...	\\
334 - No, no message. Thank you.	\\
335 - Mmm! That was a delicious	     
    dinner, Lucy.	   \\
336 - Thank you. Just something	 I
threw together. 	      \\
337 - 	    Really?		\\
338 -     Those crÃªpes suzette are	  
the best I've tasted in years. \\
339 - 	Well, thank you.	\\
340 - 	Yes, they had just	    
the right amount of cognac. \\
341 -      They were even better	    
than last night's.	    \\
342 - Well, thank you, darling.	\\
343 - 	     I think we'd better     
	go, Eleanor.	   \\
344 - 		It's getting	     
	   kind of late.   \\
345 - 	 Oh, all right. 	    
I'll go put my face on.     \\
346 -       Will you excuse me?	\\
347 - Certainly.	    Certainly.	\\
348 - Are you out of your mind?	\\
349 -     Shrimp cocktail, steak?	\\
350 - 	This dinner must	     
 have cost a fortune.	   \\
351 - 	Never mind that.	\\
352 -      I want to talk to you.	\\
353 -  Where were you this afternoon? \\
354 - 		At rehearsal.	\\
355 - 	 All afternoon? 	\\
356 - 		    Yeah.	\\
357 -   What's the matter with you?	\\
358 -   I called you this afternoon	     
     about 2:00,	   \\
359 -      and you weren't there.	\\
360 - 	I wasn't?		\\
361 - No.				\\
362 -  Well, I stepped out for a cup	    
of coffee or something.     \\
363 - 	      Ha!		\\
364 -     What are you driving at?	\\
365 -      Nothing, and we can't	     
    discuss it now	   \\
366 -     while she's here,		     
trying to get a story	   \\
367 - about how happily married	     
       we are.		   \\
368 -       Give me a cigarette.	\\
369 - 	     Okay.		\\
370 - Oh, never mind, 		 I'll
get it myself.		   \\
371 -     I'll get... I was looking	    
for my cigarette case.	    \\
372 - 		 I misplaced it.\\
373 - 	  I'm all set.		     
	       All right.  \\
374 - 		Here you are,	     
	   sweetheart.	   \\
375 -       Thank you, darling.	\\
376 - 	      I was looking for      
	 my cigarette case.\\
377 - 	I misplaced it, so...	\\
378 -      I bet it's in that sport	     
coat I wore this afternoon.\\
379 - Oh, well, I'll get it, dear.	\\
380 - 	     RICKY:		    
Oh, thank you, darling.     \\
381 -      I'll get my overcoat.	\\
382 -     I'll be right with you.	\\
383 - 			Okay.	\\
384 - 		Oh! Is this it? \\
385 - Yeah.				
Thank you very much.		\\
386 - We-we got it, honey.		 See
you later.		    \\
387 - 	    Bye, Lucy. Thanks	     
       for a nice day.	   \\
388 - 	Good-bye.		\\
389 - 			  RICKY:     
		     Bye.  \\
390 - 	 (door shuts)	      \\
391 - 	    Hi. I just saw	     
       Miss Harris leave   \\
392 -      and I thought I came up	     
to see how everything went.\\
393 - 		 How were my	     
	    crÃªpes suzette?\\
394 - 	  (wailing)	      \\
395 -       Aw, were they soggy?	\\
396 - 	      No.		\\
397 - 		Were they heavy?\\
398 - 	      No.		\\
399 -      Well, did they flame?	\\
400 -     Yeah, they flamed.		\\
401 -     Well, what's the matter?	\\
402 - 	  (sobbing)	      \\
403 -   I just found out that Ricky	  is
seeing another wo-wo-wo...  \\
404 - 		Ricky's what?	\\
405 - Ricky is seeing 		
another wo-o-... wo-o-o...	\\
406 -     What does Ricky want to	    
see another wo-wo for?	    \\
407 -  Ricky is seeing another woman! \\
408 - 	      Oh, Lucy, what are     
	 you talking about?\\
409 - That!				\\
410 - 		 I don't get it.\\
411 - 	     Who's Minnie Finch?\\
412 - 	 I don't know.		\\
413 -   All I know is, I called him	     
 at the club at 2:00,	   \\
414 -       and he wasn't there.	\\
415 -       So he wasn't there.	\\
416 -   Now, don't you give me that.	\\
417 - 	 You can see it 	    
as plain as I can.	    \\
418 -     Ricky is a very handsome	     
   and charming man	   \\
419 -  and he's out late every night	\\
420 -       and he's surrounded	     
by beautiful showgirls	   \\
421 -      and-and then now that.	\\
422 -   And I'll bet she's the most	  
beautiful showgirl of all.    \\
423 - And I'm going down to see her	 and
have it out!		    \\
424 - 	Oh, now, Lucy, you're	     
   being ridiculous.	   \\
425 - 	Oh, am I?		\\
426 -     If some woman was trying	   to
take Fred away from you,   \\
427 -     you'd sing another tune.	\\
428 - 	    Yeah, "Happy Days	     
       Are Here Again."    \\
429 - How can you make jokes		 at a
time like this? 	   \\
430 - Now come on, get your coat.	\\
431 - I'll go see if Mrs. Trumbull	 can
take care of Ricky.	    \\
432 - 	  Well, how can you tell     
     who lives where?	   \\
433 - 	    There are no numbers     
       on the doors.	   \\
434 - Lucy, does this look like	 the
kind of place		    \\
435 - one of Ricky's girlfriends	
would live?			\\
436 - 	  Well, that just shows      
     you how shrewd she is.\\
437 - 	    She doesn't think	     
       anybody'd look here.\\
438 - Okay. Let's knock on the door	 and
ask where she lives.	    \\
439 - 		    All right.	\\
440 - 	 Suppose she lives here,     
    what do I say?	   \\
441 - Why, just say, "Good evening,	
madam," punch her in the nose	\\
442 - and get it over with.		\\
443 -     I know, I'll pretend that	    
I'm conducting a poll	    \\
444 - 	    and I'll... I'll	     
       sort of introduce   \\
445 -   Ricky's name subtly, you know,  
and see how she reacts, huh?  \\
446 - That's a good idea.		\\
447 -     Oh, pardon me,		\\
448 -     but could you tell me	    
where Minnie Finch lives?   \\
449 -      Well, that's her place	     
     right there.	   \\
450 - 	You're standing 	     
right in front of it.	   \\
451 -     Thank you.			\\
452 - Do you want to see Minnie	     
    or don't you?	   \\
453 - 		    Yes, I do.	\\
454 - 	    Well, then, knock!	\\
455 - 	 (shouting):		Hey,
Minnie, you got company!  \\
456 -       You got to give her	     
a chance to hear you.	   \\
457 -     You girls looking for me?	\\
458 - Uh, no. I-I don't think so.	\\
459 - Is Minnie Finch at home?	\\
460 - 		Oh, that's me.	\\
461 - Oh.				\\
462 -       Well, what can I do	     
       for you? 	   \\
463 - Well, um,			
we're, uh...			\\
464 - we're, we're			
conducting a poll,		\\
465 - and we'd like to ask you	 some
questions.		   \\
466 - 	  Uh... hmm...		\\
467 - 	    Say, your name	     
       ain't Kinsey, is it?\\
468 - No. No, we're...		\\
469 -      We're conducting a poll	     
to find out who is the most\\
470 - 	popular orchestra leader     
   in the country.	   \\
471 - Oh, yes, yes.			\\
472 - Do you, uh, happen to know	
Ricky Ricardo?			\\
473 -     Do I kn... do I know him?	\\
474 - 		  I'll say I do.\\
475 - 	 Say, he's mad about me.\\
476 - Mad about you?			\\
477 - 			And how.\\
478 - 	I got a date with him	     
   Saturday night.	   \\
479 - 	Oh.			\\
480 - Do you see him often?		\\
481 -     You want to laugh?		\\
482 -      Five years ago, I went	 to
the Tropicana on my birthday.\\
483 - 	 Well, they brung a big      
    cake over to the table,\\
484 - 	and Ricky Ricardo	     
   come over and kissed me.\\
485 -     And today, five years later,\\
486 - 	I get a card		     
   asking me for a date.   \\
487 - 	      (cackling laugh)\\
488 -       Oh, boy, when I kiss them,     
 they stay kissed.	   \\
489 - 		    (laughs)  \\
490 -     I'll show you the card.	\\
491 - 		 I don't get it.\\
492 - Neither do I.			\\
493 -     There, there. See that?	\\
494 - Now, how about that, huh?	\\
495 - Yes, he, uh, he must		 have
been impressed. 	   \\
496 - Yeah, but not half as impressed     
as Joe was this morning.    \\
497 -     Joe?			\\
498 - 	      That's my husband.\\
499 - 	  He's terrible jealous.\\
500 - 	      (cackling laugh)\\
501 -     I gave him an awful time	    
with that card this morning.\\
502 - 	He went storming out	     
   of here, fit to kill.   \\
503 - 	     WOMAN:		     
       Minnie!			Oh.   \\
504 - Minnie, guess who's got 	 a
date tonight		      \\
505 - with Ricky Ricardo.		\\
506 - 		    I have. See?\\
507 - Oh, did you get one, too?	\\
508 -       Minnie... Oh, girls!	\\
509 -   Look what I got in the mail.	\\
510 -     Oh! 			    
Look, Ricky Ricardo!	    \\
511 - MINNIE: 			
Well, what do you know? 	\\
512 - 	    Lucy, you know what?\\
513 - 	What?			\\
514 - 	    I'll bet you this	     
       is another one	   \\
515 - 	    of Jerry's crazy	     
       publicity stunts.   \\
516 - Do you think			
that's what it is?		\\
517 - 		Of course it is.\\
518 -      You don't think Ricky would     
date those three, do you?  \\
519 - 	Fred, yes. Ricky, no.	\\
520 - 	    Come on,		     
let's get out of here.	   \\
521 - Good-bye, girls.		\\
522 - 	 So long, kids. 	\\
523 - 	  Let me see that again.\\
524 - 		Well, I'm gonna      
	   keep mine.	   \\
525 - Does that feel any better?	\\
526 - 	    Yes, much better.	\\
527 - 	     Thank you, Eleanor.\\
528 -       Ricky, what are you	     
     doing home?	   \\
529 - 		  What happened?\\
530 -     What's the matter, dear?	\\
531 - We got out of the cab		 and
started to go into the club \\
532 - and some man walked up and said, "Are
you Ricky Ricardo?"	   \\
533 -     And I said, "Yes."		\\
534 - 	  And he said,		     
"This is for Minnie."	   \\
535 -       And he hit me. See?	\\
536 - Minnie? 			
Whatever did he mean, dear?	\\
537 -  I don't know, but it probably	     
 has something to do	   \\
538 -       with those postcards	     
 that Jerry sent out.	   \\
539 - Postcards?			\\
540 -   Yeah, he had some crazy idea	
about sending out the postcards \\
541 -   to every woman that had been	     
   in the Tropicana	   \\
542 -   and telling them that I was	    
making a date with them     \\
543 -       for Saturday night.	\\
544 -     This guy must have been	
Minnie's husband, I guess.	\\
545 -     Aw, you poor baby.		\\
546 - Imagine not trusting somebody	 that
you're married to	   \\
547 - more than that. 		\\
548 - 			Imagine!\\
549 - 	     Yeah.		\\
550 -  After all, trust is the basis	    
of every happy marriage.    \\

2 - 	     Lucy?		\\
3 - 	 Oh, good morning, dear.\\
4 - Good morning.			\\
5 - Lucy, what are you doing?	\\
6 - 	     Lucy?		\\
7 - 		Pardon me, dear.\\
8 - 		(whistles)    \\
9 - 	    A refrigerator,	     
       a deep freeze	   \\
10 -     and a chrome dinette set.	\\
11 - 		    Hi, Rick.	    
Hi, Fred.		    \\
12 -       Where're you going?	\\
13 - I want to find out		
what's going on with her.	\\
14 - She keeps running out		 into
the back porch, 	   \\
15 - and then she comes in here	\\
16 - and talks to somebody		 on
the phone.		     \\
17 - 	     Well, I'll tell you     
	what's going on.   \\
18 -     What?			     
	   Some new tenants	     
      are moving in.  \\
19 - Oh, who's she talking to	 on
the phone?		     \\
20 - 	 Ethel. There's two	     
    moving vans down there,\\
21 - 		one in front	     
	   and one in back.\\
22 - 	  She's hanging out	     
     the living room window\\
23 -      with our phone in her hand.\\
24 - Ethel's the advance scout	 and
Lucy's covering the rear.   \\
25 - Oh, those two characters.	\\
26 - 	Yeah. Nothing gets by	     
   the snoopers' patrol.   \\
27 - 	  Could I have a bite	     
     of breakfast with you?\\
28 - 		Ethel's too busy     
	   to make mine.   \\
29 -     Sure.			\\
30 -     Sit down, Fred.		    
Help yourself.		    \\
31 - Thank you.			\\
32 - 		(chuckling)   \\
33 - 	  (whistles)	      \\
34 -        An automatic washer	     
and an automatic dryer.    \\
35 - 	  A fox stole		  
and a full-length mink coat?  \\
36 - How do you know it's mink?	\\
37 -   Has a Saks label in it, huh?	\\
38 -       Ethel must be using	     
    my binoculars.	   \\
39 -      Uh-huh. A green couch	    
and a modern desk.	    \\
40 -      Got it. Over and out.	\\
41 - 			Lucy.	\\
42 - 	 Can I help it		    
if the moving men	    \\
43 -      happen to be bringing	     
     something in	   \\
44 - while I just happen to be	    
on the back porch?	    \\
45 -     Besides, a little		    
friendly inventory	    \\
46 -     never hurt anyone.		\\
47 - 		Now, what are	     
	   you gonna do?   \\
48 - Don't fight it. 		\\
49 -      Nosiness is just part	    
of a woman's charm	    \\
50 -      like hanging stockings	   in
the bathroom and nagging.  \\
51 - ETHEL:				
Lucy!				\\
52 - 	  There's the other one.\\
53 - ETHEL:			LUCY:	
Lucy!			Yeah?	\\
54 - That does it. They're all	
moved in in front.		\\
55 - 	  Yeah, they're finished     
     out here, too.	   \\
56 - 	Oh! If I could just have     
   seen that mink coat.    \\
57 -     It was just 		    
gorgeous.	Was it?     \\
58 -     What do you suppose was	    
in all those big boxes?     \\
59 - 	     I don't know. Isn't     
	it sneaky of them  \\
60 - 	      bringing things in     
	 in closed boxes,  \\
61 - 		 so we can't see     
	    what's in them?\\
62 - I'll say it is. 		\\
63 -     Honest to			    
goodness...			     
	   Lucy?       \\
64 - 		What?		\\
65 - 		How do you feel?\\
66 - 		Fine.		\\
67 - 		Are you all	     
	   right, Ethel?   \\
68 -     Sure. Why?			\\
69 - Fred, I'd like to report to you \\
70 -      that contrary to what	    
you've always been told,    \\
71 -  curiosity does not kill a cat. \\
72 - 		Oh, you think	     
	   you're so smart.\\
73 - 	What else do you know	     
   about them, Ethel?	   \\
74 - All I know is that		
their name is Johnson.		\\
75 - I didn't get a chance		 to
ask her anything else.	     \\
76 -       Well, let's go up and	     
 give her the third degree.\\
77 - 	I mean, pay her a visit.\\
78 - 	You know, if I didn't	     
   live here already,	   \\
79 - 	I sure wouldn't move in.\\
80 -       (doorbell buzzes)       \\
81 -      I wonder who that is.	\\
82 -   Pardon me, could you tell me	  
where I can find Mrs. Mertz?  \\
83 -   She isn't in her apartment.	\\
84 - Yeah, she's here.		
Won't you come in?		\\
85 - 	Oh, thank you very much.\\
86 - 	    I'm Mrs. Johnson,	     
       the new tenant.	   \\
87 - Oh, Mrs. Johnson!		\\
88 - Oh, come over			 and
sit down, dear. 	    \\
89 - 	Why, thank you. 	\\
90 - I hate to bother you all,	\\
91 - but I just wondered		 if
Mrs. Mertz		     \\
92 - had an extra set of keys	 for
our apartment.		    \\
93 - Yeah, yeah, I'll get her,	     
    I'll get her.	   \\
94 -     Ethel,			    
she's here.			     
       Who?	       \\
95 - I got her right in there,	 Mrs.
Johnson.		   \\
96 - Yeah, come on.			     
       Mrs. Johnson?	   \\
97 -     What?			     
		   Lucy!   \\
98 - 	      What are you gonna     
	 do, grill her?    \\
99 - Like a cheese sandwich. 	\\
100 - 	 Come on, Rick, 	    
we'd better watch this.     \\
101 - 	Oh, hello, Mrs. Johnson.\\
102 - 	    I'm glad to see you.\\
103 - 	    I'd like for you	     
       to meet Mr. Ricardo.\\
104 - 	     And this is my	     
	husband, Mr. Mertz.\\
105 - 	    How do you do?	\\
106 -     Charmed, I'm sure.		\\
107 -     Mrs. Mertz, honey,		\\
108 - 	could you let me	     
   in my apartment?	   \\
109 - I'm such a cotton-headed ninny,      
 I locked myself out.	   \\
110 - 	    Why certainly, dear.\\
111 -     Fred, go get the other key	    
to Mrs. Johnson's apartment.\\
112 - I've got a key right here	 in
my pocket.		     \\
113 - 	    The one that's	     
       in our apartment.   \\
114 - 		All right.	\\
115 - 		And don't hurry.\\
116 - 		  This will give     
	     us a chance   \\
117 - 	      to get acquainted      
	 with Mrs. Johnson.\\
118 - Yes, Mrs. Johnson,		\\
119 - if you're going to live here,	 we
should know all about you.   \\
120 - Now, we'll tell you		 all
about us,		    \\
121 - and you tell us 		 all
about you.		    \\
122 - I'll go first.			 What
does your husband do?	   \\
123 -     Why, he's in oil.		\\
124 - Hair, suntan,			 cod
liver or castor?	    \\
125 - 	  Oh, heavens.		\\
126 - 	 We don't mess		 with
any of them in Texas.	   \\
127 -       He's got oil wells.	\\
128 - Oil wells?	      Oil wells?\\
129 -       Well, just a couple	   of
those little bitty ones.   \\
130 - Well, uh, those little bitty	
ones, they do pump oil? 	\\
131 -     Well, not as much		   as
you're pumping her, dear.  \\
132 - Mrs. Johnson, I-I-I must	
apologize for my wife.		\\
133 - 		    Apologize?	     
	       Oh...	   \\
134 - 		    Why, we	     
	       in Texas,   \\
135 - 	    just call that	     
       being neighborly.   \\
136 - 	Oh, yeah.		\\
137 - 		  MAN:		     
	     Nancy? Nancy?	     
	Where are you?\\
138 -      Oh, I'm in here, Sam.	\\
139 - 	  Oh, there you are, my!\\
140 - 	    Pardon me, folks,	\\
141 - 		 I-I don't mean      
	    to-to barge in.\\
142 - That's all right.		\\
143 -     Sam, I want you to meet	    
the nicest people.	    \\
144 -       This is Mrs. Mertz.	\\
145 - 		  How do you do?
	    How do you do,	     
       Mr. Johnson?	   \\
146 -     And this is 		    
Mrs. Ricardo.		    \\
147 - How do you do,	  How are you,	 Mr.
Johnson?      ma'am?	    \\
148 -     And Mr. Ricardo.		\\
149 -     How are you, sir?		     
       How do you do?	   \\
150 -     And this is 		    
Mr. Mertz.		    \\
151 - 		  It's my	     
	     pleasure, sir.\\
152 - 	    How are you, sir?	\\
153 - Mr. Johnson, your wife tells us \\
154 -  that you dabble in oil wells.	\\
155 - 		     (guffaws)\\
156 - 	      Now, Nancy, honey,\\
157 - 		  I told you not     
	     to go around  \\
158 - 	    telling people that.\\
159 - It's not that I'm ashamed of it,\\
160 -  but it's just that everybody's      
 always pestering me	   \\
161 -   to-to buy into my new well.	\\
162 - Well, I can certainly		
understand that, Mr. Johnson.	\\
163 - 		Yeah, I guess	     
	   everybody	   \\
164 - 	likes to get in on a	     
   sure thing like that.   \\
165 - Oh, uh-huh.			\\
166 - 		But I don't like     
	   to-to build up  \\
167 - 		  all those nice     
	     people's hope \\
168 - 		and then have to     
	   disappoint them.\\
169 -       You see, I only have	    
a few shares left.	    \\
170 - 	Oh?			\\
171 - I wouldn't be selling any shares\\
172 -     only, well, doggone it,	     
    I like people.	   \\
173 -   And as long as we had to go	  
extra deep for this gusher,   \\
174 -     I says to myself,		    
"Sam, why don't you give    \\
175 -      somebody else a chance	    
to be rich, too?"	    \\
176 - 		  Well, come on,     
	     Nancy, honey. \\
177 - 		We've got to	     
	   start unpacking.\\
178 -  Here's your key, Mrs. Johnson.      
    Oh, thank you.	   \\
179 - 		    You're very      
	       nice people.\\
180 -     Nice meeting you.		\\
181 - 		    Good-bye.	 Bye,
sir.			   \\
182 - 	Good-bye.		\\
183 -     He's got shares		    
to sell.		    \\
184 -  (Lucy and Ethel chattering)  \\
185 - Wait a minute,			
everybody!			\\
186 - Now, just hold it		 a
minute, everybody.	      \\
187 - Let's not get excited		 over
nothing.		   \\
188 - 	    Nothing? Mr. Johnson\\
189 - 	      has shares to sell     
	 in his oil well.  \\
190 -     So? 			\\
191 - 	  So get your checkbook!\\
192 - Are you crazy or something?	\\
193 - Do you think that		 I'm
gonna buy oil stock	    \\
194 - from a perfectly stranger?	\\
195 - 		Oh, now listen,      
	   he looks honest.\\
196 - 		    I can tell. \\
197 - 	    He has a kind face	     
       and nice eyes.	   \\
198 - He's got a kind face		 and
nice eyes.		    \\
199 - 			Yeah.	\\
200 - 		Well, he has.	\\
201 - Look, if he's a millionaire,	\\
202 - what is he doing		
living in this dump?		\\
203 - Dump?!			Dump?!	\\
204 - Yeah, to a millionaire, 	 this
is a dump.		   \\
205 - 		  I accept that.\\
206 - 		 What's he doing     
	    living here?   \\
207 -     He already told us		    
why he's living here.	    \\
208 -  If he lived in a fancy hotel,	    
people would pester him.    \\
209 -     Nobody'd think of		    
looking for him here.	    \\
210 - Look, honey,			 I
don't care what you say.      \\
211 - I don't want any part		 of
any oil stock.		     \\
212 - 			Oh!	\\
213 - Tough luck, Lucy.		\\
214 - Fred, this is our		 one
big chance.		    \\
215 - What are you going		 to
do about it?		     \\
216 - Are you going to be		 a
dumb bunny, too?	      \\
217 - 	     Uh, what's up, Doc?\\
218 - 	Oh...			     
	       Oh...	   \\
219 - Let's face it, Ethel.		\\
220 -      This is our one chance	     
to move on easy street	   \\
221 -       and we're married to	    
a couple of roadblocks.     \\
222 - 		    Now Ricky,	 Now
listen, Fred!	listen!     \\
223 - 	 (clamoring)	      \\
224 -       Where have you been?	\\
225 - Oh, eh, out getting a paper.	\\
226 - 		    Oh. 	\\
227 - 		Ricky?		\\
228 -     Yeah?			\\
229 -      About that oil well...	\\
230 -     Oh, no. I thought		    
we dropped the subject.     \\
231 -  Well, I'm picking it up again. \\
232 - 		Listen, I've	     
	   been thinking...\\
233 - 	    maybe that oil stock\\
234 - 	    wouldn't cost us	     
       as much as we think.\\
235 - 	    Now, look, you could     
       take our savings,   \\
236 - 	then I'll pay you	     
   back out of the money   \\
237 - 	that I save out of	     
   my household account.   \\
238 - Lucy, with the money you save	 out
of your household account,  \\
239 - we couldn't buy enough oil	 for
a salad.		    \\
240 - 		    Oh...	\\
241 - Are you gonna sit there and	 let
this opportunity slip by?   \\
242 - 	      Do you think	     
	 I like being poor?\\
243 - Do you think I like living	 in
this little apartment	     \\
244 - doing my own housework? 	\\
245 - Washing and ironing and cleaning and
sweeping and cooking.	    \\
246 - 	      (crooning):	     
       La de da da...\\
247 - I wouldn't mind 		 if
you couldn't help it,	     \\
248 - but when I think how		
you're throwing away		\\
249 - the one chance in our lives	 to
become millionaires...	     \\
250 - 		(crooning):	     
	 La de..     \\
251 - Well, I don't care.		\\
252 - I think this is 		 a
good opportunity.	      \\
253 -      Now, look, the subject	     
   is closed.		   \\
254 -       I don't want to hear	     
    another word.	   \\
255 -       The man doesn't have	     
any more stock to sell	   \\
256 - and that's the end of it.	\\
257 - Why I can't			 make
you see 		   \\
258 - 	      that just maybe...\\
259 - 		 How do you know     
	    he doesn't have\\
260 - 	 any more stock to sell?\\
261 -      Oh, yeah, well, uh...	\\
262 -  I-I didn't think it would hurt      
 anything to find out	   \\
263 -  a little more about the stock,      
   you know.		   \\
264 -  So, uh, this morning I-I went	 
upstairs and I talked to him   \\
265 -   and he said that he doesn't	     
 have any more left.	   \\
266 -     That means he must have sold    
those shares to someone     \\
267 - 	      between last night     
	 and this morning. \\
268 - 	Now, who in the world	     
   could it have been?	   \\
269 - 		    Fred!	\\
270 - 	Howdy, partner. 	\\
271 -     Could you all, uh, spare	     
   a dish of coffee	   \\
272 -     for an oil tycoon?		\\
273 - 		 Well, a fine	     
	    friend you are!\\
274 -     Now, what's the matter?	\\
275 - 		We wanted to buy     
	   that stock.	   \\
276 -      Well, you didn't sound	     
 like it last night.	   \\
277 - 	      You didn't either.\\
278 -     Did you tell them, Fred?	\\
279 - Well, Ethel, I hope you're happy  now
that you jumped our claim. \\
280 - 		  What are you	     
	     talking about?\\
281 -     We wanted to buy that stock,    
as if you didn't know.	    \\
282 - 	      How could we know?\\
283 - 	Then why did you rush in     
   and change your minds   \\
284 - 	    just before we did? \\
285 -     What a sneaky thing to do.	\\
286 -     Oh, for goodness sake.	\\
287 - 	    Well, Ricky, when	     
       money comes into it,\\
288 - 	  you certainly find out     
     who your friends are. \\
289 -  I wouldn't be surprised if they 
refused to split with us now.  \\
290 -     Split?		Split?	\\
291 - You had just as much chance	 to
buy it as we did.	     \\
292 - Yes, Lucy, Fred is right.	\\
293 - We had just as much chance	 to
buy it as they did.	     \\
294 - We just have			 to
face it, honey, 	     \\
295 - the Mertzes will be rich,	 and
we'll still be poor.	    \\
296 -     Oh, now, don't go putting	    
on a poor mouth.	    \\
297 - 	     Well, maybe someday\\
298 - 	     they'll invite us	     
	to their penthouse.\\
299 - 	    'Course I don't mind     
       so much for myself. \\
300 - 	I was just thinking	     
   about poor little Ricky.\\
301 -       That money could have gone     
 for his college education.\\
302 - 	  Well, that's certainly\\
303 - 	hitting a rich godmother     
   below my money belt.    \\
304 - Poor little Ricky.		\\
305 - 			Yeah.	\\
306 -     My son.			\\
307 - 			Yeah.	\\
308 - Oh, all right,			 all
right.			    \\
309 - We'll split it			 with
you.			   \\
310 - 		      That's	     
		 wonderful!\\
311 - 	    Fred, you're a pal! \\
312 - That's the least		 I
could do, I guess.	      \\
313 - Now, we've got ten shares,	 and
we'll give you one.	    \\
314 - 	That really is		     
   the least you can do.   \\
315 - All right, two. 		\\
316 - Okay, three.			\\
317 - 		  We have three.\\
318 - 		 Do I hear four?\\
319 - 	Four.			\\
320 - 		 We have four.	     
	    Do I hear five?\\
321 - 		    Five.	\\
322 - Oh, now,			 just
a minute.		   \\
323 -     Oh, come on, Fred.		\\
324 - Yeah, Fred.			\\
325 - What's five shares		 to a
big oil typhoon like you?  \\
326 - That's tycoon.			\\
327 - All right, then,		 you
can have five.		    \\
328 - 		  Do I hear six?\\
329 -     Lucy...			\\
330 - 	Oh, I'm just kidding.	\\
331 - 	  That's really very	     
     generous of you, Fred.\\
332 -       I wish there were some way     
 that we could repay you.  \\
333 - Well, there is. 		 You
can pay me		     for the
five shares.		\\
334 - 	    Oh. Write him out	     
       a check, Ricky.	   \\
335 -      How much is it, Fred?	\\
336 - 	$600.			\\
337 -     $600?			\\
338 - 	      Oh, what's the	     
	 difference, honey?\\
339 - 	  In a week or so, we'll     
     all be millionaires.  \\
340 - Sure.				\\
341 -       All right, partner!	\\
342 -     We'll all be rich.		\\
343 - 		In a week or so!\\
344 -     (all talking at once)     \\
345 - 	  Good mornin', Lucy-Lu.\\
346 - Hi, Ethel, honey.		\\
347 - Are those new furs?		\\
348 - 	No. They're yesterday's.\\
349 - 	      Oh.		\\
350 - 	  (guffaws)	      \\
351 - How much did they cost? 	\\
352 - Does Rockefeller tell DuPont?	\\
353 - 	  (chuckles)	      \\
354 -     I got them on approval just     
like you did that mink coat.\\
355 - 	Yeah.			\\
356 - 	 How do you like my hat?\\
357 - Oh, I like it.			 It's
dreamy. 		   \\
358 - I got a new hat, too.		\\
359 - 		Let me see it.	\\
360 - 		    Aw...	\\
361 - 	    Oh, that is 	     
       really wonderful.   \\
362 - 		My, let me see	     
	   the top of...   \\
363 - 		That's great.	\\
364 -       Howdy, folks. Howdy.	\\
365 - LUCY:				 Hi,
Fred.			    \\
366 - 		 How do you like     
	    those furs?    \\
367 - 	     Pretty classy, huh?\\
368 - Oh, yeah.			
They're wonderful.		\\
369 -   You know, I think I'm gonna	 like
being a millionaire.	   \\
370 - Millionaire, millionaire.	\\
371 - You know,			 I've
said it so often	   \\
372 - that it doesn't 		 mean
much anymore.		   \\
373 - 	     You know something?\\
374 -     What?			\\
375 - 	     We might even get	     
	to be billionaires.\\
376 - Yeah, or even			
trillionaires.			\\
377 - 	Or even zillionaires.	\\
378 - Yeah, or even...		\\
379 - What comes			
after zillionaires?		\\
380 - The income tax department.	\\
381 - 		    Oh, Fred.	\\
382 - 	     RICKY:		     
	Lucy!		   \\
383 - Yeah, we're in here, Tex.	\\
384 - 		    Tex?	\\
385 - I mean Cube.			\\
386 - 	FRED:			     
   You drill any more		   
wells today, partner?	\\
387 - Hiya, partner.			     
       Good mornin', Ricky.\\
388 - (laughs)		      \\
389 - 	Don't you think 	\\
390 - 	    you're going	     
       a little too far?   \\
391 - Well, now, how do you		
expect us to dress		\\
392 - if we're going to be		
Texas oillionaires?		\\
393 - 	     Well, I don't know,\\
394 - but my father always told me,	
"Never cross your chickens	\\
395 - 	     before your bridges     
	is hatched."	   \\
396 - What was that?			\\
397 - What was that again?		\\
398 - 		  You know	     
	     what it means.\\
399 - 	      It means, tha-that     
	 don't go spending	     
    your money	      \\
400 - 	      before you get it.\\
401 - "Don't go spending your money	
before you get it."		\\
402 -     (phone ringing)	      \\
403 -     (mocking tone):	       
"Don't go spending your money	     
before you get it."	  \\
404 - 	     Hello.		\\
405 - 	      Oh.		\\
406 - 	Oh, yes, I see. 	\\
407 - Oh, yes, I'll tell Mr. Ricardo. \\
408 - 	      Yes.		\\
409 - 	     Well?		\\
410 -  That man wanted me to tell you \\
411 -     that your custom-built,	    
periwinkle-blue Cadillac    \\
412 -       would cost $12,000.	\\
413 -     And, yes, they could fix	  
the horn to play "Babaloo."   \\
414 -     Oh, look who isn't		    
spending his money.	    \\
415 -   Well, I was just digging up	   a
little bit of information,  \\
416 - 	  that's all.		\\
417 - 	You don't see me	  
spending my money before...   \\
418 - 	I know, I know. 	\\
419 -     "...before your bridges	     
     is hatched."	   \\
420 -       (doorbell buzzes) 	     
		 $12,000!\\
421 - 	Periwinkle blue.	\\
422 - 		      How do you     
		 like that?\\
423 -     Somebody's at the door.	\\
424 - 		Good afternoon.  Oh,
hello.			    \\
425 -     Say, do you know where	    
I can find the mana...?     \\
426 - 	 Hi, Fred. Hi.		     
	   Oh, hi, Ken.    \\
427 - Say, have you got a fella	     
living in the building	   \\
428 -     by the name of Johnson?	\\
429 - 		Yeah, he's	     
	   upstairs in 4-B.\\
430 -      I rang there. I guess	     
they must not be home.	   \\
431 - 	 Well, is there anything     
    I can do for you?	   \\
432 -       No, no. I just want	     
   to talk with him	   \\
433 -      about some oil stock.	\\
434 - 			Oh?	     
   Yeah. I'll			   
catch him later.	\\
435 - 	So long, folks. 	\\
436 - So long.			     
		   So long.\\
437 - ETHEL:				 Hey,
he looks familiar.	   \\
438 - 		LUCY:		     
	   Yeah, who is he?\\
439 -     Yeah.			    
He's a detective.	    \\
440 - 	    We must be in on	     
       a pretty good deal. \\
441 - 	    If he's going to buy     
       some of the stock,  \\
442 - 	    it must be okay.	\\
443 - Suppose he doesn't want 	 to
see Mr. Johnson 	     \\
444 - about buying the stock? 	\\
445 - 	 Well, what other reason     
    would he want to see...\\
446 - 		    We have been     
	       swindled!   \\
447 - 	Sure!			\\
448 - I knew the minute		 I
laid eyes on that man	      \\
449 - that he was a crook.		\\
450 -   You said he had a kind face!	\\
451 -  Yeah, I didn't say what kind.	\\
452 - 	  Well, there goes all	     
     our hard-earned money.\\
453 - 		How do you	     
	   like that?	   \\
454 - Wait a minute.			 Wait
a minute.		   \\
455 - There must be some way		 out
of this.		    \\
456 - After all, he promised us	\\
457 - 	  a big gusher		     
would come in any day.	   \\
458 - Yeah.				     
    Well, we don't		    
have any proof	       \\
459 -     that he said that.		\\
460 - We have to have evidence.	\\
461 - Evidence?			     
   Evidence?		   \\
462 - That's what we got		 to
get-- evidence. 	     \\
463 -     Oh, that's gonna to be	    
a little hard to find.	    \\
464 -     (all muttering)	      \\
465 - 		    We got to	     
	       get some.   \\
466 - What do I know about oil?	\\
467 - I got to get mixed up		 with
this character here.	   \\
468 - We got to prove 		 what
he said right...	   \\
469 - Watch out where you're going!	\\
470 - 		  Well, don't	     
	     get mad at me.\\
471 - 	     I'm in this just as     
	much as you are.   \\
472 - You are in this 		
exactly as much as we are.	\\
473 - No wonder you wanted to unload	 all
those shares on us.	    \\
474 - 	    Unload?!	Unload?!\\
475 -     Well, maybe unload		     
is not the right word.	   \\
476 -      But, after all, Fred,	\\
477 - we all know how you are 	 with
your money.		   \\
478 - And it was pretty obvious	 the
way you begged us	    \\
479 - to take the stock		 off
your hands.		    \\
480 - We begged you?! 		\\
481 -     See, he admits it.		\\
482 - 		  Come on, Fred.\\
483 - 		    Let's get	     
	       out of here.\\
484 - 		  That's the	     
	     thanks we get.
			Yeah.	\\
485 -     If you're the kind of people\\
486 - 	    we would have had	     
       to associate with   \\
487 -      if we were millionaires,	     
I'm glad we were wiped out!\\
488 -     Ethel.			\\
489 - 	I'm not speaking to you.\\
490 -     I know, I'm not speaking	     
    to you either,	   \\
491 - but this is an emergency.	\\
492 - 	  Can we have		     
 a five-minute truce?	   \\
493 - I know how we can get		 our
money back.		    \\
494 - 		How? How?	\\
495 - See this			 tape
recorder?			     
	  Yeah.       \\
496 - Ricky said we needed evidence.	\\
497 - Now, I am going to get		 Mr.
Johnson 		    \\
498 - to repeat everything		\\
499 - that he promised us		
about the oil wells.		\\
500 -     Oh, he won't say a word	    
if he sees that recorder.   \\
501 -     Naturally.			\\
502 - You are going			 to
hide out in the hall	     \\
503 - and run the recorder.		\\
504 - Now, look.			 See
this microphone?	    \\
505 - I have it hidden right here.	\\
506 - 		    Yeah.	\\
507 - Look at that.			     
	       Uh-huh.	   \\
508 - I have the wire run down	\\
509 - inside my slacks, see?		\\
510 - 	      Gee.		\\
511 - Listen, Ethel,		Oh.	\\
512 - if this works,			\\
513 - we won't have any reason	 to
be mad at each other anymore.\\
514 - 		    (chuckles)\\
515 - 		Shall we do it	     
	   right now?	   \\
516 - Yeah. Come on. I have to carry	 this
up in the hall...	   \\
517 - 		 There. It's	     
	    all plugged in.\\
518 - 	    Now I have to put	     
       this in here.	   \\
519 - 	 Now, when I get inside,     
    you press this button  \\
520 -      and turn this to this side.\\
521 -     Okay.			     
	       Okay.	   \\
522 -     And then let the cord out	\\
523 - 		as I move around     
	   the apartment.  \\
524 - 	    Now, when I get all      
       the evidence I need,\\
525 - 	 and I'm ready to leave,\\
526 - 	I'll jerk on the cord	     
   twice like this.	   \\
527 -     Yeah.			     
       See? And then you   \\
528 -       reel me in fast because	     
 I'll be ready to come out.\\
529 - Okay. Okay.			\\
530 - 		    Now, listen.\\
531 - 		Keep the cord	     
	   very taut	   \\
532 - 	     so that you'll know     
	when I'm ready.    \\
533 - 		Keep it taut.	
Okay, all right.		\\
534 - 	Don't give me any slack.\\
535 - No, I won't.			\\
536 -       (doorbell buzzes)       \\
537 - 	  (buzzing)	      \\
538 - 			Hello.	\\
539 - Oh, Mrs. Ricardo.		\\
540 - Won't you come in?		\\
541 - 		Thank you.	\\
542 - Sam, we've got company. 	\\
543 - You have to excuse		 the
way I look.		    \\
544 - I was just doing some more	 of
our unpacking.		     \\
545 - 	 Well, that's all right.\\
546 - Well, well, howdy, little lady! \\
547 - 	     Hello, Mr. Johnson.\\
548 - 	I hope you don't mind my     
   dropping in like this,  \\
549 - 		 but I wanted	     
	    to talk to you.\\
550 - 	Glad to have you	     
   any time at all.	   \\
551 - 	Excuse me.		  
I'll continue my unpacking.   \\
552 - 		  Certainly.	     
	     Mr. Johnson,	     
	it's just that\\
553 - 		I'm terribly	     
	   worried about   \\
554 - 	     the oil stock	     
	we bought from you.\\
555 - 	     SAM:		     
	Well, honey child,	     
   don't let it bother\\
556 - your pretty little redhead.	\\
557 - No, sir, that oil stock 	 is
just as safe		     \\
558 - as U.S. government bonds.	\\
559 - And in no time at all,		
you...				\\
560 - 	Uh.... would you	     
 repeat that, please?	   \\
561 -     Huh?			\\
562 - 	    I said, would you	     
       repeat that, please,\\
563 - 	    just to reassure me?\\
564 - Well, I said			
those oil stocks		\\
565 - was as safe			 as
U.S. government bonds.	     \\
566 - 		    Uh-huh.	\\
567 - And in no time at all,		
you'll be rolling in money.	\\
568 - 	    Oh, that's right.	\\
569 - 		 As soon as that     
	    well comes in, \\
570 - 	     You won't be able	     
	to count the money,\\
571 - 	  it'll come in so fast.\\
572 - Have you any idea how much	
money we'll be making?		\\
573 - Oh, you ought to get back	 your
investment,		   \\
574 - oh, I would say,		 a
hundred times over.	      \\
575 - Why, the fact of the matter	 is,
Mrs. Ricardo,		    \\
576 - I wouldn't worry none.		\\
577 - After all, I wouldn't		 let
you invest in a well	    \\
578 - that wasn't gonna come in.	\\
579 - Uh, Mrs. Ricardo...		\\
580 - are you all right?		\\
581 - 		  Oh, yes, yes,      
	     I'm all right.\\
582 - 	    I'm just a little	     
       nervous, I guess,   \\
583 - 	     about all the money     
	I've invested.	   \\
584 - Well, now,			
honey child,			\\
585 - you don't need			 to
worry none.		     \\
586 - 	    No? 		     
	       Mercy no.   \\
587 - 	      You can trust Sam.\\
588 -   Well, I've been in this game	 a
long time, Mrs. Ricardo,      \\
589 - and I've seen a lot		 of
wells in my day,	     \\
590 - but I look for this well	 to
be a real lollapalooza.      \\
591 - Why, do you know, Mrs. Ricardo? \\
592 - Unless I miss my guess...	\\
593 - 		How's that?	\\
594 - I said unless			 I
miss my guess,		      \\
595 - this little baby		 is
gonna gush		     \\
596 - like no gusher			 ever
gushed before.		   \\
597 - 	 Uh, uh, whoa!		\\
598 - What's going on here?		\\
599 - 		    Well, what's     
	       that cord?  \\
600 - 	Oh, Ethel,		    
all right, Ethel!	    \\
601 - 	  Ethel, stop!		\\
602 - 	     Ethel!		\\
603 -  I'll tell you what's going on. \\
604 - 	    We have		    
all the evidence we need    \\
605 -     on a tape recorder		     
   out in the hall.	   \\
606 - Evidence?			     
    Yes, evidence.	   \\
607 -      Evidence that you two	 are
trying to swindle us.	    \\
608 - 		    Swindle?!	\\
609 - Now, wait a minute.		\\
610 -       Our money, or we are	     
 going to the police.	   \\
611 - Now, you're making		 a
big mistake.		      \\
612 -     Our money, please.		\\
613 - Why, that well's liable 	 to
come in anytime.	     \\
614 -      Are you gonna give us	     
   our money		   \\
615 -  or will we take this recording      
    to the police?	   \\
616 - Now, just a minute,		
ma'am.				\\
617 - Down Texas way, 		 a
deal is a deal. 	      \\
618 -     Our money, please.		\\
619 - 	      Sam, if that's	     
	 the way she feels,\\
620 - 	 give her back her	     
    nasty little old money.\\
621 - All right, honey pot.		\\
622 -       Thank you very much.	\\
623 -     All right, Ethel,		     
     reel me in!	   \\
624 - 	     Uh...		\\
625 -      Ethel, slack up a bit.	\\
626 - Well, here's to the smartest,	
cleverest, little wife		\\
627 - 	     in the whole world.\\
628 - Hear! Hear!			\\
629 - It really			
wasn't anything.		\\
630 - 	     Oh, let him tell	     
	all about it again.\\
631 - 	      I like to hear it.\\
632 - Well, so do I.			\\
633 -     Well, I tell you, honey,	\\
634 - that was the greatest idea	     
    you ever had.	   \\
635 - Oh, thank you.			\\
636 -   We're all out of this mess,	\\
637 - and we owe it all to you.	\\
638 - 	Well... 		     
	   Wait a minute.  \\
639 - 	Wait a minute.		     
   Wait a minute. Shh...   \\
640 -     What's the matter?		\\
641 -       (doorbell buzzes)       \\
642 - 	    Fred, that sounds	     
       like our buzzer.    \\
643 - 	    Go see if somebody's     
       at our door.	   \\
644 - All right.			\\
645 - 	I didn't know you could      
   hear our buzzer in here.\\
646 - Sure. How do we know		 when
you have company?	   \\
647 - 	  (laughing)	      \\
648 - 	     FRED:		     
       Oh, Ken. 	   \\
649 - 		    Oh, there	     
	       you are.    \\
650 - 	We're over here.	\\
651 - 	    Oh, say, I wonder if\\
652 - 		I could use your     
	   phone a moment. \\
653 - 		    Use ours.	\\
654 - 	    Oh, thanks, thanks.      
       This one can't wait.\\
655 - 		I... I just made     
	   the greatest... \\
656 - 		    greatest buy     
	       in my life  \\
657 - 	     from that... from	     
	that Johnson fella.\\
658 - 	    You bought something     
       from Mr. Johnson?   \\
659 -      Yeah, yeah. Oil stock.	\\
660 - 		Honey, honey,	     
	   I got it.	   \\
661 - 		  Yeah, for	     
	     a while there,\\
662 - 	I thought it was	     
   going to be too late.   \\
663 -  Yeah, but-but Mr. Johnson said \\
664 -     that some dopes returned	 the
block of stock to him,	    \\
665 - 	 and he sold it 	    
to me five minutes	    \\
666 -       before we got a wire	    
saying they struck oil.     \\
667 - 	     KEN:		     
	Yeah, you can get	     
   that mink coat now.\\
668 - 		     Ha, ha, ha!\\
669 - 	     Yeah, that's right.
	     That's right.	\\
670 - 		 And open up	     
	    that champagne.\\
671 - 	     I'll be right home.
	     Good-bye.		\\
672 - 	    Thanks a lot, folks.\\

1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song	     
   playing)		 \\
2 - 		Hi, honey.	\\
3 -     Oh, hi.			\\
4 - 	Where's Little Ricky?	\\
5 - He's still asleep.		\\
6 - 		    Was he good?\\
7 - Oh, he was just perfect.	\\
8 -     What a disposition		     
    that kid has.	   \\
9 - 	Just wonderful. 	\\
10 -      Just like his old man.	\\
11 -     Oh, he's a little angel	     
   all right.		   \\
12 - 	    Wait till you see	     
       what I bought.	   \\
13 - Lucy, not another hat.		\\
14 - 	Now, don't say a word	     
   until you've seen it.   \\
15 - 	    Now, don't you think\\
16 - 		 that's the most     
	    beautiful hat  \\
17 - 	    you've ever seen?	\\
18 - Yeah, I think it's great.	\\
19 - 		You do? 	\\
20 -     Mm-hmm.			\\
21 - You know, frankly, I never	 have
liked that hat on you.	   \\
22 - What's the matter, honey?	\\
23 -      You never like my new hats.\\
24 - 	     You always like	     
	my old ones better,\\
25 - 	so this time I put	     
   my old one in the box   \\
26 - 	  and I wore my new one.\\
27 -     You dirty double-crosser.	\\
28 -     (chuckling) 	      \\
29 - 		I never can seem     
	   to outsmart you.\\
30 - 	  (laughing)	      \\
31 - 	    Aw, you're such	     
       a clever husband.   \\
32 - 	  (laughing)	      \\
33 - (still laughing)	      \\
34 - Oh...				\\
35 -  You should have seen your face \\
36 -       when I said I didn't	    
like your new hat.	    \\
37 -       Yeah, I guess it was	    
pretty funny all right.     \\
38 -     (both laughing)	      \\
39 -     Well, wait, wait, wait,	     
 wait just a minute.	   \\
40 - 	      I didn't say	     
	 you could keep it.\\
41 - 		 How much is it?\\
42 - Oh, come on now, honey. 	\\
43 - 		  Come on, Lucy.\\
44 - You're in			 such
a good mood.		   \\
45 - Why spoil it?			     
		   Lucy... \\
46 -     Look, if I tell you now,	     
 you'll just get mad.	   \\
47 - 	There's no sense	 in
you losing your temper	     \\
48 - 	every time		    
I bring something home.     \\
49 -   Why don't you wait till the	  
bills come in for everything  \\
50 -     and get mad all at once?	\\
51 - 	 Now look, I'm not going     
    to lose my temper.	   \\
52 -     No? 			\\
53 - 		 Just let me see     
	    the price tag. \\
54 -     No. 			\\
55 - 		    Lucy...	\\
56 - No. Now,			
look, look, look.		\\
57 - Isn't this beautiful?		\\
58 - Don't you think it's worth	
almost any amount of money?	\\
59 - 		    No. 	 No?
Well... 		    \\
60 - 		    Price tag.	\\
61 - 		49.50?! 	\\
62 - 	 Como te vas pagar 49.50\\
63 - Now, now, now,			
honey...			     
	por sombrero...!   \\
64 - Honey, you said 		 you
weren't going to get mad.   \\
65 - 	  That was before I knew     
     how much it cost!	   \\
66 - But it's such a beautiful hat,	 and
I needed it.		    \\
67 - 		 Needed it?!	\\
68 -     Yes.			\\
69 - 		You got a closet     
	   full of hats.   \\
70 - I haven't either.		\\
71 - 			Ha!	\\
72 - 			Huh!	\\
73 - What are you doing?		\\
74 - 	What do these look like?\\
75 - Well, they do look like hats,	
don't they?			\\
76 - 		Yeah, they do	     
	   look like hats. \\
77 - But none of those		 look
good on me.		   \\
78 - 	Oh, I wouldn't say that.\\
79 -     Now, this is a lovely	    
little hat, look at that.   \\
80 - 	And look at this one.	\\
81 - 	 This is one of my	     
    favorites of all times.\\
82 - 	 Look at that hat there!\\
83 - 		And this hat--	\\
84 -     this is a Jim Dandy here.	\\
85 - 	    Look at that one.	\\
86 - 		 And this is	     
	    a beauty. Look.\\
87 -     Now, what, there you are.	\\
88 - 	Now, isn't that the	     
   most ridiculous thing   \\
89 - 	     you've ever seen	     
	in your whole life?\\
90 - 	    You got a fortune	\\
91 - 	      invested in each	     
	 one of these hats,\\
92 - 	    and now none of them     
       look good on you.   \\
93 -      You only got one head.	\\
94 -   Why do you buy so many hats?	\\
95 - 	(crying)	      \\
96 - 	 And don't cry. 	  I
don't like it when you cry.  \\
97 - 	(cries harder)	      \\
98 - 	 Don't do that! 	\\
99 -   I should never have married	     
 a hot-blooded Cuban.	   \\
100 -      I should have married	     
a cold-blooded Swede.	   \\
101 - (continues crying)	      \\
102 - 		  Now don't cry!\\
103 - Every time			 I
spend a little money,	      \\
104 - you lose your temper.		\\
105 - 	      What do you mean	     
	 I lose my temper?!\\
106 - 	 I never lose my temper!\\
107 - Well, you're the first person	 I
ever saw whose veins bulge    \\
108 - just because they have		 a
good disposition.	      \\
109 - Go look at yourself.		\\
110 - Go on. Take a look.		\\
111 - 			See?	\\
112 - 	(phone rings)	      \\
113 - (tosses mirror) 	      \\
114 - 	  (sniffles)	      \\
115 - 	     Hello?		\\
116 -   May I speak to Mr. Ricardo,	     
       please?		   \\
117 -     Uh, just a minute.		\\
118 - 	 It's for you.		\\
119 - 		    Hello!	\\
120 - 	 Hello, Ricky,		    
this is Morris Williams.    \\
121 - 		    Yeah?	\\
122 - I lined up			 a
ventriloquist for you.	      \\
123 - 	     RICKY:		     
   Oh, good.		   \\
124 - I've been going 		 over
the act with him,	   \\
125 - and he's perfect		 for
what you want.		    \\
126 - 	     RICKY:		     
	Yeah?		   \\
127 - Besides, he's the only		
ventriloquist			\\
128 - available in town.		\\
129 - 	    RICKY:		     
       Uh-huh.		   \\
130 - His name's Sir Hume.		\\
131 -     Oh, yes, yes, Sir Hume.	\\
132 - 	I know his act. 	\\
133 -       Now, about price...	\\
134 -     I also know that he was	     
 getting $250 a week	   \\
135 -       at the Domino Club.	\\
136 -  Well, now, his price is $500.	\\
137 - 	     $500?!		  
What's the matter with you?   \\
138 -       You think I'm crazy	     
    or something?	   \\
139 - 	Temper, temper. 	\\
140 - Oh, listen, don't give me that. \\
141 - I haven't got any temper.	\\
142 - I just don't like to be rooked,      
     that's all.	   \\
143 -     $500 A week. That's the	     
most ridiculous thing	   \\
144 -     I ever heard in my life.	\\
145 -     Well, uh, wait a minute.	\\
146 -   Let me check with my client.	\\
147 - 	  We got him.		     
He's blowing his top.	   \\
148 -      Look, I want that job.	\\
149 - Yeah, he needs food.		\\
150 - My voice is getting weak.	\\
151 -       Let me handle this.	     
I know my psychology.	   \\
152 - 	Besides, you're 	     
 the only act in town	   \\
153 - 	that can do this	     
   and he knows it.	   \\
154 - 	 Sorry, Ricky.		    
That's our price.	    \\
155 -     All right, I'll give you	    
till tomorrow noon	    \\
156 -     to come to your senses.	     
   Good-bye.		   \\
157 -    Quinientos pesos una semana	\\
158 -  para un dummy			  y
ventriloquist!		     \\
159 - (jabbering)		      \\
160 - 	     Now temper, temper.\\
161 - And don't say, "Temper, temper."\\
162 - Oh, you're right, there's	   no
sense in my fighting it.   \\
163 -     And it's just part		     
of your personality--	   \\
164 - big brown eyes, black wavy hair     
and a lousy disposition.    \\
165 - You couldn't keep		 from
losing your temper	   \\
166 - if your life			
depended on it. 		\\
167 - 		What do you mean     
	   I couldn't	   \\
168 - 		keep from	    
See?	    losing my...    \\
169 - See? Look,			\\
170 - I-I'm just not going to 	
fight it anymore, dear. 	\\
171 - I'm just going to accept it.	\\
172 -     Well, maybe you're right.	\\
173 - 	    Nobody's perfect.	\\
174 -       I got to accept you	     
 with all your faults, too.\\
175 - That's right, dear.		\\
176 - That's the only sensible way	 to
look at it.		     \\
177 - After all...			\\
178 - What do you mean		 "all
my faults"?!		   \\
179 - 	Like your 'stravaganzis.\\
180 - What "'stravaganzis"?		\\
181 - 	You couldn't keep	     
   from buying a new hat   \\
182 - 		  if your life	     
	     depended on it\\
183 - 		and it may.	\\
184 -     I could, too.		\\
185 - I could keep from buying	 a
new hat for a...	      \\
186 -     a... a month.		\\
187 - 		How much would	     
	   you like to bet?\\
188 - 	$49.50. 		\\
189 - 		    $49.50?	\\
190 - 	    How do you arrive	     
       at that figure?	   \\
191 - There's a hat I want to buy	 with
my winnings.		   \\
192 - 		    Uh-huh,	    
Well... 	uh-huh. See?\\
193 - All right, then I'll		 give
you a better bet.	   \\
194 - I'll bet you $49.50 that I can	 keep
from buying a hat	   \\
195 - longer than you can keep	
from-from losing your temper.	\\
196 - 		 Okay. You got	     
	    yourself a bet.\\
197 - All right.			
Starting right now.		\\
198 - 		 Well, in just	     
	    a minute, dear.\\
199 - 	     Take that hat back!\\
200 - 	 What do you think I am,     
    made of money?!	   \\
201 - 	We'll start from now on.\\
202 - 	 Oh, come now.		\\
203 -     I bought that hat		    
before we made the bet,     \\
204 -       so I get to keep it.	\\
205 -       Now, just a minute.	\\
206 -       I have to pay for it	     
after we made the bet,	   \\
207 - 		so it goes back.\\
208 -      I won't take it back!	\\
209 -   What do you think of that?!	\\
210 - 	      I...		\\
211 - Oh, no, you're not gonna	
catch me as easy as that.	\\
212 - 	     Take it back, dear.\\
213 - I won't.			\\
214 - 		  Yes, you will.\\
215 - 		  It's an order.\\
216 - 		Take it back.	\\
217 - 	No.			\\
218 - 		    You must.	\\
219 - I don't must.			\\
220 -     I'm sorry you have		     
   to take it back.	   \\
221 - 		Yeah, well...	\\
222 - 	(gasps) 		     
       What's the matter?\\
223 - Oh, look, Lucy, they're 	
having a half-price sale.	\\
224 - 	Oh! If I look, I'm lost.\\
225 - 	 Just lead me in, Ethel.\\
226 - 	I'll return the hat	     
   and get it over with.   \\
227 - Okay. Come on.			\\
228 - 		Half-price sale.\\
229 - Wouldn't you know it, today?	\\
230 -       Here's the door now.	     
   Look out.		   \\
231 - Oh, heavens!			\\
232 - 	    Hello, Mrs. Mulford.\\
233 -       Hello, Mrs. Mulford.	\\
234 - Why, Mrs. Ricardo,		
what's the matter?		\\
235 - Nothing. I'm just		
fighting temptation.		\\
236 - I don't want to see		 all
the goodies.		    \\
237 -     Huh?			\\
238 - 	     She bet her husband\\
239 - 	that she wouldn't buy	     
   another new hat.	   \\
240 - 	Oh.			\\
241 - 	I have to return	     
   this one.		   \\
242 - You mean that adorable hat	 you
bought yesterday?	    \\
243 - Please, don't torture me.	\\
244 -     Just take it back.		\\
245 - 	Come on, Ethel. 	\\
246 -      Let's get out of here.	\\
247 -     Well...			     
	       Okay.	   \\
248 - Oh, Mrs. Mertz, 		 can
I show you something?	    \\
249 - We're having a special		 on
cocktail hats.		     \\
250 - 	Cocktail hats?! 	\\
251 -     Oh, Ethel, Ethel,		\\
252 - 	 that feeling's 	     
coming over me again.	   \\
253 -     I can't fight it.		\\
254 -       Get me out of here.	\\
255 -      Help me to be strong.	\\
256 - 		  Okay. Come on.\\
257 - 	 Cocktail hats. 	     
    Cocktail hats.	   \\
258 - Oh, Mrs. Mertz. 		     
	       (gasps)	 \\
259 - 	    What is it?!	\\
260 - 		Oh, isn't	     
	   that darling?   \\
261 - 	  What is it?!		     
     What is it?!	   \\
262 - 		Uh, uh, nothing,     
	   nothing.	   \\
263 -     It is, too, Ethel.		    
Tell me about it.	    \\
264 - 			    Now?
	  Oh, come on.		\\
265 -     Just telling me about it	     
 won't hurt anything.	   \\
266 - 		It's just a hat.\\
267 - It's all covered		 with
little pearls.		   \\
268 - 	    Pearls!		\\
269 - And it's a lovely shade 	 of
turquoise.		     \\
270 -      Oh, no, not turquoise!	\\
271 - 	 Oh, turquoise! 	    
I love turquoise!	    \\
272 - 	Lucy, Lucy, it's just an     
   ordinary shade of blue. \\
273 - 		Now, come on.	\\
274 - 	     Oh...		\\
275 - It's half-price.		\\
276 - 	 I'll take it!		\\
277 - 	      Now wait a minute.\\
278 - 		You haven't	     
	   even seen it.   \\
279 - 	 I don't care.		    
It sounds so wonderful.     \\
280 - 	Oh!			\\
281 - 		    Oh! 	    
Now, Lucy, Lucy...	    \\
282 -     What about Ricky?		     
 What about the bet?	   \\
283 - 		    Oh, Ethel...\\
284 - 	 Lucy Ricardo,		    
you see that door?	    \\
285 -     You march right straight	    
out of this door.	    \\
286 - 	  It's got little pearls     
     and everything	   \\
287 - 	and a little feather.	\\
288 - 	March.			\\
289 - 		  Oh, all right.\\
290 - 	Go ahead.		\\
291 - 	Attagirl.		     
   You can make it.	   \\
292 - It's an original.		\\
293 - 	    I got to have it!	\\
294 -     Oh! 			\\
295 - Oh, isn't it			
adorable?!			\\
296 - Oh, Ethel,			 look
at it.			   \\
297 - Oh, Mrs. Mulford,		
won't this look wonderful on me?\\
298 -      Please, Mrs. Ricardo,	    
don't ask me that.	    \\
299 -       You know I never try	 to
influence my customers.      \\
300 - 	      Oh.		\\
301 - 		Will you take it     
	   with you?	   \\
302 - Yes. Uh, I mean, no.		\\
303 - Send it out			
tomorrow.	    'Course.	\\
304 - Oh, and be very careful 	 of
it, Mrs. Mulford.	     \\
305 - Oh, I will.			    
Oh.			    \\
306 - 	Come on, Ethel. 	\\
307 - I got a lot of work to do.	\\
308 -       I got to make Ricky	     
   lose his temper	   \\
309 -       before they deliver	     
 that hat tomorrow.	   \\
310 - 	Hi, honey.		\\
311 - Hi, dear.			\\
312 -     Oh, what a night.		\\
313 - 		    Tough, huh? \\
314 -     Yeah.			\\
315 - What are you doing up		 so
late?			     \\
316 -      Oh, I couldn't sleep,	\\
317 - 	  so I thought		     
I'd read for a while.	   \\
318 - Oh.				\\
319 -      How did everything go	     
     at the club?	   \\
320 - Terrible.			\\
321 - I made everybody		 come
back and rehearse.	   \\
322 - That's why I'm so late. 	\\
323 - 	      Oh.		\\
324 -  Gee, that's right, it's 4:00.	\\
325 - Yeah.				\\
326 -   You didn't lose your temper,	     
    did you, dear?	   \\
327 - No.				\\
328 - 	  That's good.		\\
329 - You take			 your
hat back?		   \\
330 - 	Oh, yeah, sure. 	\\
331 - I'm dead tired. 		\\
332 - 	Dead tired, huh?	\\
333 - Yeah.				\\
334 - Yeah, I'm ready 		 to
drop.			     \\
335 -       Just ready to drop,	     
   poor baby.		   \\
336 - 	  (yawning)	      \\
337 - 	  (yawning)	      \\
338 -     Good night, honey.		\\
339 - Good night, dear.		\\
340 - 		    (groans)  \\
341 - Sweet dreams.			
Sleep tight.			\\
342 - 		Sweet dreams.	     
	   Sleep tight.    \\
343 -     (music playing loudly)    \\
344 - 		What's that?!	     
	   What's that?!   \\
345 - 	 What's that?!		\\
346 -     What's the matter, dear?	\\
347 - 	Is it too loud? 	     
		   What?!  \\
348 - 	     Huh?!		\\
349 - Is it too loud? 		\\
350 - 	Is it too loud?!	\\
351 -     (music playing softly)    \\
352 - No, no, it isn't too loud.	\\
353 - 	 I just thought 	 it
might disturb the neighbors. \\
354 - 	 Oh, oh, well,		 
I'll turn it off, then, dear.  \\
355 - That was very thoughtless of me.\\
356 -       Thank you very much.	\\
357 - That's all right,		
honey.				\\
358 -     Good night, dear.		\\
359 - 		     Good night.\\
360 -     (scraping)		      \\
361 - (scraping)		      \\
362 - (scraping)		      \\
363 - (scraping)		      \\
364 - Please, please, please, please. \\
365 -     I-I can hear that		     
all the way over here.	   \\
366 -     Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, dear.	\\
367 - Oh, I won't do it anymore.	\\
368 - 	    That's all right.	\\
369 - I'm very sorry. 		\\
370 - 	    That's all right.	     
       That's all right.   \\
371 - Good night, dear.		\\
372 - 		Good-good night.\\
373 - 	 (crunching)	      \\
374 - (crunching loudly)	      \\
375 - (crunching loudly)	      \\
376 - You want something to eat?	\\
377 - 	      Eat?		\\
378 - Have a cracker, honey.		\\
379 - 		I don't want...  Oh!
Oh, honey,		    \\
380 - I'm sorry.			\\
381 - Oh... baby.			\\
382 - (crunching)		      \\
383 - Good night, dear.		\\
384 - 	  Good night.		\\
385 - (crunching louder)	      \\
386 - (crunching continues)	      \\
387 - What's the matter, dear?	\\
388 - Something wrong?		\\
389 - 	    No, no.		\\
390 - 	      No.		\\
391 -       Everything's lovely.	\\
392 - You sure			 you
don't want a cracker?	    \\
393 - No, I don't want one, no.	\\
394 - Good night, dear.		\\
395 - 		Good-good night.\\
396 - 	  (cracking)	      \\
397 - (cracking)		      \\
398 - 	  (cracking)	      \\
399 - (cracking)		      \\
400 - (hammering)		      \\
401 - (continues hammering)	      \\
402 - 	     Nuts?		\\
403 - 	 Not right now. 	\\
404 -      Well, you let me know.	\\
405 - 	     Yeah.		\\
406 - (hammering)		      \\
407 -     (door slamming)	      \\
408 -       (raucous flapping)      \\
409 - Sorry, honey. 7:30.		\\
410 - Got to have the sheets		 for
the laundry man.	    \\
411 - 			Lucy.	\\
412 - Yes, dear?			\\
413 - 	     I know		  
what you are trying to do...  \\
414 -   but it's not going to work.	\\
415 - 		    Hmm!	\\
416 - I was only trying to help, dear.\\
417 -     You never can find		 
your slippers in the morning,  \\
418 -  so I nailed them to the floor. \\
419 - 	 Uno, dos, tres,	\\
420 - 	      cuatro, cinco,	     
	 seis, siete, ocho,\\
421 - 	 nueve, diez... 	\\
422 -  It was very thoughtful of you. \\
423 - 			Lucy.	 Did
you get it?		    \\
424 - 		     Here it is.\\
425 - 		 Has he lost	     
	    his temper yet?\\
426 - No, and I'm			 in a
terrible mess.		   \\
427 - That hat's gonna		 be
delivered any minute.	     \\
428 - I hope this works.		\\
429 - 		Oh, it'll work. \\
430 - 	    You see that design,     
       those leaves?	   \\
431 -     Yeah.			     
       Well, there's a hole\\
432 - 	 in the cut there in the     
    middle of each leaf.   \\
433 -     Oh, yeah.			\\
434 - 	      Now, you fill that     
	 up with liquid    \\
435 -     and when he drinks it,	    
it dribbles all over him.   \\
436 - Oh, boy, and he's wearing	 a
white dinner jacket!	      \\
437 - A white dinner jacket?		      \\
438 - Yeah. He's taking		
publicity pictures.		\\
439 - That's what			 gave
me the idea.		   \\
440 - 	    Oh, what a break.	\\
441 - 		(laughs)      \\
442 - I think tomato juice		
might look just ducky		\\
443 - on that white coat.		\\
444 -       Don't go beyond that line.\\
445 - 	Why?			\\
446 - 	See? It'll all spill out\\
447 - 	before he gets		     
   a chance to drink it.   \\
448 - Oh, yeah. Okay. 		\\
449 -     Uh, Ricky!			\\
450 - 	     I'll see you later.\\
451 - Where are you going?		\\
452 -     I don't want to be here	    
when he blows his Cuban top.\\
453 - 		    Ricky!	\\
454 - 	     RICKY:		     
	Yeah?		   \\
455 - 		 Lunch is ready.\\
456 - 	All right.		\\
457 -     (Ricky yawning)	      \\
458 -      Sit right down, dear.	\\
459 - 		    Thank you.	\\
460 -     What's the matter?		\\
461 -     I don't trust you.		\\
462 - 	  I apologize.		\\
463 - 		  What is this?!\\
464 -     Well, it's, uh, it looks	 like
toma... tomato juice, dear.\\
465 -   It's a lovely shade of red,	     
   isn't it?		   \\
466 - 	      Hi.		\\
467 - Hello, Fred.			\\
468 - 		Who shot him?	\\
469 -     Nobody.			\\
470 - 		Well, did he cut     
	   his throat?	   \\
471 - No. He dribbled tomato juice	 all
over himself.		    \\
472 - 		    Oh. 	\\
473 - 	    Well, has he lost	     
       his temper yet?	   \\
474 - No. Still under control.	\\
475 - 		    Good.	\\
476 -      Ricky, I brought back	\\
477 - 	 your golf club 	     
   that I borrowed.	   \\
478 - 		I was practicing     
	   in Central Park \\
479 - 	    and a tree jumped	     
       in front of me.	   \\
480 - 	(all laughing)	      \\
481 - 	  (wailing)	      \\
482 -     (phone ringing)	      \\
483 - 	     Hello.		\\
484 -      Hello, this is Morris.	     
   Is Ricky there?	   \\
485 -     Uh, just a moment.		\\
486 -   It's somebody named Morris.	\\
487 -      Tell him I'm not home.	\\
488 -       Uh, he's right here.	\\
489 - Just a second.			\\
490 - 	     Hello?		\\
491 - Hello, Ricky, we've		
thought it over carefully	\\
492 - and he can't do it		 for
less than $500. 	    \\
493 - 	     I see.		\\
494 - Well, if that's the man's price,    
that's the man's price.     \\
495 - 	 Unfortunately, 	    
I can't afford it.	    \\
496 - Uh, is this Ricky Ricardo?	\\
497 -   Yes, this is Ricky Ricardo.	\\
498 -      Well, look, maybe 500	    
is a lot of money.	    \\
499 -   Let me check with my client.	\\
500 - He didn't even raise his voice. \\
501 -   He must have somebody else.	\\
502 -   Listen, I want you to get me	     
that job at any price.	   \\
503 - 	Uh, Ricky,		\\
504 - just because of his great	
personal regard for you,	\\
505 -   he says he'll do it for 350.	\\
506 -      I'm sorry, we'll just	    
have to forget it.	    \\
507 - 	      300?		\\
508 - 	      No.		\\
509 - Okay. We'll do it for 250.	\\
510 -     Well, you know...		     
 as a matter of fact,	   \\
511 -      I only have $200 left	     
    for that act.	   \\
512 - $200? You know he gets 250	     
 everywhere he works.	   \\
513 -      All right, all right,	 I
don't want to be unfair.      \\
514 -     I'll give you 250.		\\
515 - Oh, thank you. Thank you.	\\
516 - 		      All right.\\
517 - 		    Good-bye.	\\
518 - What happened?			\\
519 - 			Nothing.\\
520 - Was it bad?			\\
521 - 		    No, no, no. \\
522 - 	    As a matter of fact,     
       it's very good.	   \\
523 -     Oh? 			\\
524 - 		 Yeah. I just...\\
525 - 	    I just learned a	     
       wonderful lesson.   \\
526 - Oh, you did?			\\
527 - 		    Yes, sir.	\\
528 - 	 I didn't lose my temper     
    and I saved $250.	   \\
529 - Well, that's wonderful! 	\\
530 - 		And you know	     
	   something else? \\
531 -     What?			\\
532 - 	    I owe it all to you.\\
533 -     To me?			\\
534 - 		That's right.	\\
535 - 	      So, I'm going to	     
	 buy you a new hat.\\
536 -     Well...			\\
537 - what about the bet?		\\
538 -     Oh, forget about the bet.	\\
539 - 	     Honey, from now on,\\
540 - 	I'm going to be the	     
   happiest, calmest man   \\
541 - 	     in the whole world.\\
542 - Well, honey,			
that's wonderful.		\\
543 - Well, I'll, I'll call up	\\
544 - and-and order the hat		 that
I want. 		   \\
545 - 	    No. Look, go around,     
       shop for a while.   \\
546 - 	    I'll buy you	     
       any hat you want.   \\
547 - Oh, well, I know the hat	 that
I want, dear,		   \\
548 - and I'll, I'll call up		\\
549 - and I'll have them send it over  on
their fastest delivery.      \\
550 - Okay, sweetheart.		\\
551 - 			Well... \\
552 - 		Hello. Hello,	     
	   Mrs. Mulford.   \\
553 -       This is Mrs. Ricardo. Yes.\\
554 - Mrs. Mulford, do you know	\\
555 -  that darling little turquoise	     
 hat with the pearls	   \\
556 - that I liked so much yesterday? \\
557 -     Yes. Would you put that	     
     on my charge	   \\
558 -     and send it out, please?	\\
559 -      Yes, on your fastest,	     
 speediest delivery.	   \\
560 -       Thank you very much.	\\
561 -       (doorbell buzzes)       \\
562 - Well, they certainly		 have
fast delivery.		   \\
563 - They-they have			 very
good service there.	   \\
564 - Yeah, that's the one		 I
ordered all right.	      \\
565 - 		    Lucy.	\\
566 - Yes, sir?			\\
567 -       When did you buy this hat?\\
568 -     How's that? 		\\
569 -       When did you buy this hat?\\
570 - Remember,			 you
learned your lesson.	    \\
571 - 		     I remember.\\
572 -     When did you buy the hat?	\\
573 - Yesterday afternoon.		\\
574 - 	    Yesterday afternoon?\\
575 - Yes, sir.			\\
576 - 		(chuckling)   \\
577 - 	    You bought the hat	     
       yesterday afternoon?\\
578 - 	Yeah.			\\
579 - 		(guffawing)   \\
580 -     (both guffawing)	      \\
581 - 	 That means that you	     
    lost the bet yesterday.\\
582 - Yes, I guess it does.		\\
583 -     (both guffawing)	      \\
584 - 		And you made me \\
585 - 	    go through all that      
       torture for nothing.\\
586 - Yeah, I guess...		\\
587 - 	 (guffawing)	      \\
588 - 	Yeah.			\\
589 - 	    Oh, that's a killer.\\
590 - 	 (guffawing)	      \\
591 - Ah! Oh, oh, Ricky! Ricky!	\\

\subsection {Episode 20: Home Movies}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Ethel, I thought we were going over
to the Ricardos' tonight.\\
3 - ETHEL: We are. I'm ready.\\
4 - All right.\\
5 - Come on.\\
6 - You'd better take your glasses with
you.\\
7 - What for? I know what Lucy and Ricky
look like.\\
8 - Suppose Ricky wants to show us his
home movies again.\\
9 - He wouldn't dare.\\
10 - He's been showing them to us every
night.\\
11 - Well, after all, it's his first movie
camera\\
12 - and the first pictures he's got of
the baby.\\
13 - Well, count me out.\\
14 - If I want to see old movies,\\
15 - I can stay home and watch television.\\
16 - Well, what can we do?\\
17 - I'll tell you what we'll have to do.\\
18 - Don't let the conversation lag.\\
19 - Don't even give them a chance\\
20 - to suggest showing the movies.\\
21 - Hey, that's a good idea.\\
22 - Now, just remember,\\
23 - here's what you've got to do--\\
24 - just keep talking and talking\\
25 - and talking and talking.\\
26 - You know, act normal.\\
27 - No, no, no, I take that back.\\
28 - I need you on my team tonight.\\
29 - Now, get in there and fight and keep
those lips moving.\\
30 - Lucy?
Yeah?\\
31 - Aren't the Mertzes coming over
tonight?\\
32 - Yeah. They said they were.\\
33 - What do you think is holding them up?\\
34 - Gee, I don't know.\\
35 - They ought to be here any minute.\\
36 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
37 - There they are.\\
38 - Oh, good.\\
39 - I'm glad you came.
Hello.\\
40 - I wanted to...
Wasn't this a wonderful day?\\
41 - Hi. Oh, It sure was.\\
42 - particularly at this time of year.\\
43 - Uh-huh.\\
44 - What were you doing today, Rick?\\
45 - Uh, I...
I was pretty busy\\
46 - puttering around the apartment.\\
47 - Then I went over to the drugstore\\
48 - and got an ice cream soda.\\
49 - An "all around strawberry" soda.\\
50 - That's a soda with strawberry flavor
and strawberry ice cream.\\
51 - Yeah.
Uh-huh.\\
52 - Pretty good.
Yeah.\\
53 - They sure are.\\
54 - Uh, I had an idea...\\
55 - How are you, Lucy?\\
56 - Fine.\\
57 - And what's new?\\
58 - Nothing.\\
59 - I had an idea that maybe...\\
60 - Fred, Fred, there's something I've
been wanting to ask you.\\
61 - Well, what is it, Ethel?\\
62 - Uh... how are you, Fred?\\
63 - Fine. How are you?\\
64 - Oh, pretty good.\\
65 - I don't think either one of you are
well.\\
66 - I had an idea that maybe tonight...\\
67 - Oh, look! Lucy's got some delicious
new candy.\\
68 - Want a piece, Fred?
Yeah.\\
69 - Okay, there you are.\\
70 - I guess I'll have a piece, too.\\
71 - (chuckles)\\
72 - Ethel, those are just those same old
caramels\\
73 - you gave us for Christmas.\\
74 - I had an idea, like I was saying,\\
75 - you know that what-what maybe you
would like to do tonight,\\
76 - and I thought you'd like to see\\
77 - the pictures of I took of the baby.\\
78 - Oh, honey, Ethel and Fred\\
79 - don't want to see those pictures
again.\\
80 - What are you talking about?\\
81 - They're pictures of their godson.\\
82 - Oh, Ricky, we'd really love to see
them, but...\\
83 - it hurts our eyes to look at them\\
84 - on that old wrinkled sheet you use
for a screen.\\
85 - Oh?\\
86 - Outside of that, we'd be delighted to
see them.\\
87 - Oh.\\
88 - (chuckles)\\
89 - (chuckling)\\
90 - You see? You see?\\
91 - Now, the reason I wanted you to see
them again\\
92 - is because I wanted you to see them\\
93 - in this new screen I bought today.\\
94 - Wait till you see them in that!\\
95 - Go get your glasses, Fred.\\
96 - I'll watch without them.\\
97 - You can't see without them.\\
98 - I know what I'm doing.\\
99 - I got it all set up\\
100 - just in case you asked to see them
again.\\
101 - Fred, uh, ge-ge-ge-get-get-get rid of
your head, will you?\\
102 - What do you want me to do-- take it
off?\\
103 - I mean, you know, move it over.\\
104 - All right, all right.\\
105 - Turn the lights off, honey.\\
106 - Yeah.\\
107 - Here we go!\\
108 - (click)\\
109 - (film projector whirring)\\
110 - (No audio)\\
111 - RICKY: This would have been a good
shot\\
112 - if Lucy just didn't argue with me.\\
113 - (chuckling)\\
114 - Doesn't he look cute?
Look at that.\\
115 - A pretty good close-up.\\
116 - You know, this one was a great
idea...\\
117 - but things moving that fast are
pretty tough.\\
118 - Ah, how's that, huh?\\
119 - How's that for a moving shot?\\
120 - Right through the bedroom and into
the nursery.\\
121 - Have you ever seen anything better
than that\\
122 - in real movies?\\
123 - Huh? Look at the way that focuses all
the way.\\
124 - You can see them in the mirror in the
back.\\
125 - See the mirror in the back there?\\
126 - This would have been great\\
127 - if I hadn't tripped over the baby's
wagon.\\
128 - This is a great way to get killed--\\
129 - just take a picture of your wife\\
130 - when she wakes up in the morning.\\
131 - Ooh!\\
132 - (chuckling)\\
133 - Now, the next ten minutes of film\\
134 - is just as good as anyone has ever
taken.\\
135 - I don't want to brag, but, uh,\\
136 - (voice fading): I think that I
learned pretty fast.\\
137 - (normal voice): And as Lucy holds up
little Ricky and waves good-bye,\\
138 - we say a reluctant farewell\\
139 - to the Ricardo apartment and its
charming inhabitants.\\
140 - This is a Ricky Ricardo production!\\
141 - (humming fanfare): Bum bum bum bum
bum bum...!\\
142 - That's all.\\
143 - You know, they're very good,\\
144 - considering that those are the first
pictures\\
145 - that I...\\
146 - Lucy.\\
147 - More! More!\\
148 - Dear, those were really wonderful.\\
149 - Don't you think so, Eth...?\\
150 - Ethel? Fred?\\
151 - Ew...\\
152 - (screaming)\\
153 - Oh!\\
154 - Oh, you...\\
155 - What's the matter with you two
scaring me to death?\\
156 - We wanted to be sure the coast is
clear.\\
157 - Is Ricky very mad?\\
158 - I'll say. He wouldn't even talk to me
this morning.\\
159 - We're the ones who sneaked out.\\
160 - What's he mad at you for?	 
Yeah.\\
161 - I fell asleep.\\
162 - Oh, no.\\
163 - Good morning.\\
164 - Good morning!\\
165 - Good-bye.\\
166 - Now, Ricky, wait a minute.\\
167 - We're sorry.
We really liked your movies.\\
168 - We want to see them again!\\
169 - Tonight!\\
170 - Don't we, Fred?\\
171 - Yeah! Yeah!\\
172 - My, but you sound sincere.\\
173 - Well, I mean it.\\
174 - Oh, sure.\\
175 - I do!\\
176 - I'm just dying to see those lousy
movies again.\\
177 - Fred, that's a terrible thing to say.\\
178 - Ricky put a lot of time and effort\\
179 - into those lousy movies-- those
movies.\\
180 - Oh, now, Ricky, they didn't mean
that.\\
181 - Look, you don't have to worry about
me.\\
182 - You don't have to see any of the
movies that I take\\
183 - ever again, including the TV pilot
film\\
184 - that I'm just about to audition.\\
185 - Oh, Fred, what's the matter with you?\\
186 - That's a fine thing...\\
187 - TV pilot film?\\
188 - What were you saying about a TV pilot
film?\\
189 - Nothing that concerns you.\\
190 - I was going to make one using the
three of you as actors,\\
191 - but I have changed my mind about the
supporting cast.\\
192 - Adios, amigos.\\
193 - Now, wait a minute, Ricky!\\
194 - You have fixed the sheets and
blankets.\\
195 - Now go take a nap.\\
196 - (door slamming)\\
197 - What did he mean by that?\\
198 - Yeah.\\
199 - He was trying to say\\
200 - you have made your bed, now lie in
it.\\
201 - Hi.\\
202 - Hi.\\
203 - Well, I hope you are satisfied.\\
204 - Huh?		    Now what?\\
205 - Remember that TV pilot film Ricky was
going to make?\\
206 - Remember it?\\
207 - We've all been nice to him for days,\\
208 - so he'd use us in it.\\
209 - Yeah, well, we can all go back\\
210 - to being our normal, nasty selves.\\
211 - He's already made it.\\
212 - What?\\
213 - And next week\\
214 - the most important man in television,\\
215 - Mr. Bennett Green is coming over to
look at it.\\
216 - Well, we certainly muffed that one.\\
217 - What do you mean, "we"?\\
218 - You were the ones who tippy-toed out\\
219 - in the middle of our home movies.\\
220 - You should talk, sleepytime gal!\\
221 - That's telling her, Ethel.\\
222 - Now, don't you be smart, Fred.\\
223 - You're the one who really clinched
the whole thing\\
224 - with your diplomatic remark:\\
225 - "Sure, I'm just dying to see those
lousy movies again."\\
226 - Ah, just a minute.\\
227 - Oh, really, Fred.
Oh, you two now,\\
228 - stop squabbling.\\
229 - The main thing is, what can we do
about it?\\
230 - Nothing. We're not in it, so that's
that.\\
231 - Yeah. As an old Cuban philosopher
once said,\\
232 - "We have plugged in the electric
blanket.\\
233 - Now let's take the snooze."\\
234 - Well, it's too bad,\\
235 - but it's just one of those things.\\
236 - FRED: I guess so.\\
237 - I'm not so sure.\\
238 - Hey, just a minute.\\
239 - We forgot Miss Never-say-die.\\
240 - Lucy, what are you planning?\\
241 - What are you thinking?
What's going on?\\
242 - We'll make our own TV film.\\
243 - Our own?
Our own?\\
244 - Yeah, we'll make it just like Ricky
did.\\
245 - We'll use his film, his camera, his
lights... his wife,\\
246 - and if they play their cards right,
his wife's friends.\\
247 - And then when Mr. Bennett Green comes
over,\\
248 - he'll see a double feature.\\
249 - What kind of a film will we make?\\
250 - Um... a Western drama.\\
251 - Hey.\\
252 - That's a wonderful idea.\\
253 - We'll get a name later.\\
254 - Right now we have a lot to think
about.\\
255 - We have to get costumes, scenery,\\
256 - have to find out who shoots who...\\
257 - Oh, boy!
Look at this, Fred.\\
258 - Isn't this great?\\
259 - This is fixed up great.\\
260 - LUCY: Yeah?	      Hey, Lucy!\\
261 - Here we are.\\
262 - Hi, pard.\\
263 - (laughing)\\
264 - I can't get over\\
265 - how cute you got the room fixed up.\\
266 - Well, I worked pretty hard painting
those figures.\\
267 - They look almost real, don't they?\\
268 - Look at that one.\\
269 - FRED: Well, I've had moments\\
270 - when real people looked like that.\\
271 - (guffawing)\\
272 - Come on, we got to get started.\\
273 - We got to get all this finished and
out of the way\\
274 - before Ricky gets home. 	    
Okay.\\
275 - What's that thing?
That's a projector.\\
276 - I know.
It's a new kind.\\
277 - You put the sound right on the film,\\
278 - like a tape recorder.
Oh.\\
279 - Fred, now, for the first part, you
take the picture.\\
280 - You look right through this little
red thing here,\\
281 - and then you press this button right
here, see?\\
282 - See that?	    Yeah.\\
283 - Yeah.
You press that down.\\
284 - What's this little dial here for?\\
285 - It says "8, 16, 32, 64."\\
286 - Gee, I don't know.\\
287 - Well, take a little bit of each
number\\
288 - and see what happens.\\
289 - Okay.\\
290 - Ready, Ethel?
Yep.\\
291 - Stand back here.\\
292 - Remember how we did it. Okay.\\
293 - Roll 'em. Lights, camera, action,
quiet!!\\
294 - What's that for?\\
295 - I went to a studio in Hollywood once.\\
296 - That's the way they make pictures.\\
297 - Oh.\\
298 - Fred, turn on the phonograph.\\
299 - (honky-tonk music playing)\\
300 - I'm an old cowhand\\
301 - From the Rio Grande\\
302 - And my legs ain't bowed\\
303 - And my teeth ain't capped\\
304 - I'm a cowboy who never saw a cow\\
305 - Never roped a steer 'cause I don't
know how\\
306 - And I sure ain't fixin' to find out
now\\
307 - Yippee i-o-ki-ay\\
308 - Yee-ha!\\
309 - Yippee i-o-ki-ay\\
310 - Yee-hee!\\
311 - Yee-ha!\\
312 - Ya-ka-ta-ka-ha\\
313 - I'm an old cowhand\\
314 - From the Rio Grande\\
315 - And I learned to ride\\
316 - 'Fore I learned to stand\\
317 - I'm a ridin' fool who is up-to-date\\
318 - I know every road in the Lone Star
State\\
319 - 'Cause I rode the range in a Ford V-8\\
320 - Yee-ha!\\
321 - Yippee i-o-ki-ay\\
322 - Yee-ha!\\
323 - Yippee i-o-ki-ay\\
324 - Yee-ha!\\
325 - Yippee!\\
326 - Yippee!\\
327 - Ya-ka-ta-ka-ha\\
328 - I know all the songs that the cowboys
know...\\
329 - 'Bout... that big...
corral...\\
330 - Where... the doggies...
go...\\
331 - (howling)\\
332 - (gunshot)\\
333 - 'Cause I learned them all on the
radio\\
334 - Yippee i-o-ki-ay\\
335 - Yippee!\\
336 - Yippee i-o-ki-ay\\
337 - Yee-ha!\\
338 - Yippee!
Ya-ka-ta-ka-ha\\
339 - Yee-ha!
Ya-ka-ta-ka-ha\\
340 - Whee!
Ya-ka-ta-ka-ha.\\
341 - Yee-ha!\\
342 - You know that looked pretty good?\\
343 - Yeah.
Yeah.\\
344 - Now we do the big, dramatic part of
the show.\\
345 - Now, Fred, don't forget,\\
346 - you make an entrance from over there.\\
347 - Well, who's going to run the camera\\
348 - if I'm off the scene?\\
349 - Oh, well, we set that on automatic,
see?\\
350 - We-we push this button right here\\
351 - and the camera takes a picture by
itself.\\
352 - I got it.
Okay, now, Ethel,\\
353 - don't forget where we stopped.\\
354 - Oh, I got it.\\
355 - All right, here we go.
Roll 'em, Fred!\\
356 - (camera whirring)\\
357 - How about a game of draw poker, Tex?\\
358 - Don't mind if I do, Nevada.\\
359 - Cigarette?\\
360 - Yep.\\
361 - Hold it!\\
362 - I didn't cut them cards.\\
363 - Are you accusin' me of cheatin'?\\
364 - Yep, I'm accusin' you of cheatin'.\\
365 - Smile when you say that.\\
366 - Yep, I'm accusing you of cheatin'.\\
367 - No man can say that to me.\\
368 - Smile when you say that.\\
369 - No man can say that to me.\\
370 - Reach for the ceiling, both of ya!\\
371 - Drop them guns!\\
372 - You're under arrest!\\
373 - We ain't got nothin' on us.\\
374 - You're the ones that robbed the
stage, you mangy polecats.\\
375 - How did you find out?\\
376 - I got wind of it.\\
377 - All right, I am taking you to the
clink.\\
378 - Get goin'!\\
379 - Pick it up there!\\
380 - LUCY: Cut!\\
381 - Oh, boy, that was good, wasn't it?\\
382 - I say so.\\
383 - I hope that camera didn't run out of
film.\\
384 - Don't worry...\\
385 - Film?\\
386 - Lucy.\\
387 - Well, that was a good dress
rehearsal.\\
388 - Now I'll put in the film.\\
389 - Lucy?\\
390 - Oh, the film came!\\
391 - Why didn't you wait for me?\\
392 - Who's got time to wait for you?\\
393 - I got to get this stuff spliced
together.\\
394 - How's it look?
Look at this.\\
395 - Oh, look at Fred in that outfit!\\
396 - LUCY: Look at you in those chaps.\\
397 - Hey, that mustache looks better on
film on you\\
398 - than it did really, didn't it?
Yeah.\\
399 - (guffawing)\\
400 - Oh, boy.
Doesn't that look great?\\
401 - Great.
Ricky!\\
402 - Um... wh-what are you doing here?\\
403 - I live here, remember?\\
404 - Uh, I thought you weren't coming home
to dinner.\\
405 - I didn't come home for dinner.\\
406 - I just came over to pick up my
guitar.\\
407 - What are these pictures?\\
408 - Uh...\\
409 - I asked, "What are these pictures?"\\
410 - Would you believe it if I told you\\
411 - they were taken by a sidewalk
photographer?\\
412 - No.\\
413 - No? Well, uh...\\
414 - I might as well tell you the truth.\\
415 - Um, a talent scout called us from
Hollywood\\
416 - and-and he came over here with all of
his equipment\\
417 - and-and he took pictures of all of us\\
418 - while we were, uh...
because he...\\
419 - Go on. Go on.\\
420 - I can't. I don't even believe it
myself.\\
421 - Well, all right, I'll tell you,
Ricky.\\
422 - We got mad at you because you
wouldn't let us\\
423 - be in your TV film, so we made one of
our own.\\
424 - So, you show your film to Mr. Green\\
425 - and we'll show ours.\\
426 - Mr. Green is a very busy man.\\
427 - He will only have time to see one
film.\\
428 - Well, that's very sweet of you, dear,\\
429 - but when will he see yours?\\
430 - You know what I mean.\\
431 - You won't show your film to anybody
tomorrow night.\\
432 - Now, just a minute.\\
433 - We put a lot of time and money into
this film.\\
434 - What are we gonna do with it?\\
435 - Well, just show it to each other\\
436 - while I'm running my boring baby
pictures.\\
437 - Hasta la vista.\\
438 - (door slamming)\\
439 - (sighs)\\
440 - Well, that's that.\\
441 - Oh, no, it isn't.\\
442 - Our picture will be shown\\
443 - and what's more, Ricky will be
showing it.\\
444 - What are you gonna do, switch reels?\\
445 - No. I'm gonna cut our picture into
Ricky's.\\
446 - I'm gonna figure out a way to use the
best parts of both.\\
447 - Give me Ricky's film in the closet
there.\\
448 - Put this back on here now.\\
449 - Where is it?\\
450 - Up on the top shelf.\\
451 - All those reels up there.\\
452 - Lucy, Ricky and Mr. Green just got
out of the cab.\\
453 - Yeah, well, everything's all ready.\\
454 - I just finished. Here.\\
455 - Fred, put this on the projection
machine right away.\\
456 - Right.
Oh, I hope it's all right.\\
457 - I did it in such a hurry.\\
458 - Here, pick all this stuff up.\\

Mertz.\\
466 - How do you do?\\
467 - Hi, Mr. Green.\\
468 - How are you?\\
469 - Uh, Mr. Green is very busy,\\
470 - so he just has time to see the film\\
471 - and then he has to leave right away.\\
472 - You know how demanding television is.\\
473 - Oh, I certainly do, Mr. Green.\\
474 - That's quite all right.\\
475 - Well, I know that you're looking for
some unusual shows\\
476 - and this film is liable to be\\
477 - the biggest surprise of the year.\\
478 - You can say that again.\\
479 - Well, uh, won't you sit down, Mr.
Green?\\
480 - Thank you.
Sit right over there, Mr. Green.\\
481 - That's it right over there.\\
482 - RICKY: I'll get everything settled
here.\\

564 - The funniest thing I've ever seen.\\
565 - Such imagination.\\

22 - Oh, we're checking dollar bills\\
23 - with the bonus bucks in the paper.\\
24 - Oh, you're still not doing that.\\
25 - Certainly. There's one worth $300
this week\\
26 - and I am going to win it.\\
27 - Lucy, there are eight million people
in New York City,\\
28 - and who knows how many one-dollar
bills.\\
29 - What makes you think you're gonna
win?\\
30 - I can't miss.\\
31 - All my life, I've been eating oysters\\
32 - and never found a pearl.\\
33 - Five years in a row,\\
34 - I didn't win the Irish Sweepstakes,\\
35 - and only yesterday at the grocery,\\
36 - I missed guessing the number of beans
in the jar by two.\\
37 - This time it's my turn.\\
38 - Well, I didn't know all that.\\
39 - I mean, you're a cinch.\\
40 - And if it isn't her turn,\\
41 - it certainly is mine.
That's right.\\
42 - Now let's go.
Okay.\\

Okay. "X."\\

51 - Couldn't you have made that "one" a

52 - Give me a pen and I will.\\
53 - Do we dare?\\
54 - Oh, no.\\
55 - The paper would frown on that.\\
56 - The Treasury Department would make a
face, too.\\
57 - Well, come on, Ethel.\\
58 - Give me the next one.\\
59 - That's all.
Oh.\\
60 - Well, another day, another no dollar.\\
61 - Yeah, darn it.\\
62 - Oh, wait a minute.\\
63 - We didn't go through the boys' money.\\
64 - Ethel went through mine years ago.\\
65 - I mean the money in your pockets.\\
66 - Give me yours, Ricky.\\
67 - Look, no use going through mine.\\
68 - I found a pearl in an oyster once.\\
69 - It's not my turn to win either.\\
70 - I found a diamond ring in a box of
Cracker Jack.\\
71 - Oh, now, stop!\\
72 - You stop joking.\\
73 - He's not joking.\\
74 - Where do you think he got this?\\
75 - Well, I don't care what you two do,\\
76 - but we're gonna win.\\
77 - Come on, let's go get some more,
Ethel.\\
78 - All right.
Some more what?\\
79 - You watch the baby, while we're gone,
will you, Fred?\\
80 - All right.
Some more what?\\
81 - Some more one-dollar bills.\\
82 - We're gonna take these ones and
change them into fives\\
83 - at the market, and then we go to the
drugstore\\
84 - change the fives into ones.\\
85 - We've done it six times today.\\
86 - How long will you be gone?\\
87 - Until there isn't a dollar bill left\\
88 - in this neighborhood unturned.\\
89 - Good-bye, dear.
So long, Fred.\\
90 - Good-bye.
Adios.\\
91 - We are married to a couple of birds.\\
92 - Yep. I think we'd better see\\
93 - that the door of their cage is
locked.\\
94 - Look, I got to go to work.\\
95 - Excuse me while I put my tie on.\\
96 - All right.\\
97 - Find any new pearls?\\
98 - Ah, who could tell, huh?\\
99 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
100 - I know, I know, yeah.\\
101 - I was gonna do the same thing,\\
102 - but I didn't have the paper with me.\\

104 - Let's check them.\\
105 - All right. Come on.\\

115 - Well...
Check it for me, will you?\\
116 - Yeah.
Check that!\\
117 - Yeah.\\
118 - "B, siete, ocho, quatro,\\
119 - cinco, cinco, seis, dos, nueve, G."\\
120 - Oh, read it in English, will you? In
English.\\
121 - Wait a minute, what...\\
122 - Look, I can't figure out what they
are.\\
123 - You read it to me, will you? Hurry
up.\\
124 - Here, I'll read it.\\

out.\\
138 - (whooping laugh)\\
139 - 300 smackers!\\
140 - Ho, ho, ho!\\
141 - It's too bad she couldn't find it
herself.\\
142 - Oh, yes.\\
143 - Wait a minute!\\
144 - Maybe she can.\\
145 - What do you mean, "Maybe she can"?\\
146 - Tell you what I'm gonna do.\\
147 - I'm gonna take this dollar bill with
me to the club,\\
148 - and when I come home tonight, she'll
be asleep, see?\\
149 - So, I'll sneak into the room and I'll
put this in her purse,\\
150 - and tomorrow morning, I'll ask her to
check her money again\\
151 - and let her find it.\\
152 - Oh, what a great idea!\\
153 - What a kick she'll get out of this!\\
154 - She'll die!\\
155 - Listen, don't say a word to anybody,
huh?\\
156 - No, no.\\
157 - Don't even tell Ethel.\\
158 - I won't breathe a word to Miss
Walkie-Talkie.\\

club.\\
254 - Yeah, well, where is it? Where is
it?!\\

256 - I took it to the club with me last
night\\

273 - Ours was the big one-- 300 bucks!\\
274 - So is that one.
It's ours!\\
275 - Now, wait a minute.\\

300 - It's Ethel's.\\
301 - There, you see?\\
302 - Ethel's?\\
303 - How can you say that?!\\
304 - Because possession is nine points of
the law.\\
305 - Possession?\\
306 - Mira que tiene cosa de decirle a uno
que tengo...\\
307 - Hey, he's right.
He's right.\\
308 - Fred is right.\\
309 - Well, I'm glad you finally saw the
light.\\
310 - I sure did.\\
311 - Now wait a minute, that's mine!\\
312 - Now you heard what Fred said.\\
313 - Possession is nine points of the law,
and I'm possessed!\\
314 - Give me back my dollar bill!\\
315 - (all shouting at once)\\
316 - RICKY: Ethel! Lucy!\\
317 - Well, I hope you're satisfied.\\
318 - Look what you did.\\
319 - Look what I did?\\
320 - Would you mind giving me the rest of
my dollar?\\
321 - Would you mind giving me the rest of
my dollar?\\
322 - Ethel!\\
323 - Well, it's mine!\\
324 - Now, just a minute, dear.\\
325 - The grocery boy gave it to me.\\
326 - All right, all right, now, just a
minute.\\
327 - Just a minute.\\
328 - We each have a very good case.\\
329 - So, I tell you what let's do.\\
330 - Let's split it.\\
331 - We just did.\\
332 - I mean the money.\\
333 - Let's divide it.\\
334 - No.		    Oh...\\
335 - Now, look, it says in the paper\\
336 - that somebody has to get down there
before 3:00\\
337 - with the buck, or nobody gets no
money.\\
338 - FRED: That's right.   That's right.\\
339 - All right.\\
340 - All right, Ethel, give me your half\\
341 - and I'll paste them together.\\
342 - No, you give me your half.\\
343 - Why, Ethel Mertz, don't you trust me?\\
344 - No!\\
345 - What an awful thing to say!\\
346 - Well, you don't trust me.\\
347 - That's different.
I know I can trust me.\\
348 - Oh, look who knows she can trust...\\
349 - All right, all right, now, just a
minute.\\
350 - I'll take charge of it.\\
351 - Just give them to me.\\
352 - Apparently, there's only one person
here\\
353 - who everyone trusts.\\
354 - Lucy?\\
355 - Well!\\
356 - Okay, I'll tell you what we'll do.\\
357 - We'll each keep our half\\
358 - and we'll go to the newspaper office
together.\\
359 - I'm for that.\\
360 - Okay, I'll buy that.
I'm for that.\\
361 - All right, Hey!     give it to me.\\
362 - For safekeeping.\\
363 - And I'll take charge of this for
safekeeping.\\
364 - Now I'll dress and take a shower\\
365 - and we'll all go down there together.\\
366 - Call Mrs. Trumbull.\\
367 - All right.\\
368 - Hurry up.\\
369 - (whistling)\\
370 - Yes, well, I'd appreciate it if you
could come over\\
371 - as soon as possible, Mrs. Trumbull.\\
372 - Thanks very much. Bye.\\
373 - Mrs. Ricardo, laundry.\\
374 - Oh, I forgot all about you.\\
375 - I'll get it right away.\\
376 - Okay, I'll wait.\\
377 - RICKY: La de da, la de da\\
378 - De da re\\
379 - Da da re da\\
380 - La da da da re...\\
381 - Oh, sorry to keep you waiting.\\
382 - It's okay.
Thanks a lot.\\
383 - Okay, bye.
See you next week.\\
384 - Come on, Ricky, it's half past 1:00.
Hurry up!\\
385 - RICKY: What's your hurry?\\
386 - We don't have to be there till 3:00.\\
387 - Well, I don't want to take any
chances.\\
388 - The subway might break down or
something.\\
389 - Yeah, come on, Rick.
Yeah, come on, come on.\\
390 - RICKY: All right, all right.\\
391 - Come on, let's go.
You ready?\\
392 - Good.\\
393 - Oop. Wait a minute.\\
394 - What's the matter?\\
395 - I forgot one little item.\\
396 - What?\\
397 - Our half of the bonus buck.
Oh.\\
398 - Oh.
Oh.\\
399 - LUCY: That's all we need.\\
400 - I left it in the top of my pajamas.\\
401 - Ricky?\\
402 - Yes?\\
403 - Those pajamas...\\
404 - Were they the red ones?\\
405 - Yeah.\\
406 - With the check tops?\\
407 - Yeah.\\
408 - That were hanging in the bathroom?\\
409 - Yeah. I'll go get it.\\
410 - What do you mean, "were hanging"?\\
411 - Lucy...\\
412 - Lucy?\\
413 - What did you do with those pajamas?\\
414 - I... Well, I, uh...\\
415 - What happened?\\
416 - Where I, uh...		  are they?\\
417 - How did I know there was any money in
them?!\\
418 - Where are they?\\
419 - Where are they?\\
420 - Where are they?\\
421 - At the laundry.\\
422 - TOGETHER: At the laundry?!\\
423 - At the laundry.\\
424 - How could you do a stupid thing like
that?!\\
425 - Three hundred bucks gone to the
laundry!\\
426 - If you were a man, I'd punch you in
the nose.\\
427 - Well, now, wait a minute, it isn't my
fault.\\
428 - It's Ricky's fault.\\
429 - Ricky's!    Ricky's!	Ricky's!\\
430 - Sure. How did I know there was
anything\\
431 - in the pocket, and that was a pretty
silly place to put it!\\
432 - Yeah!	Yeah!\\
433 - That was a pretty dumb stunt.\\
434 - Yeah!\\
435 - And if you weren't such a young man,\\
436 - I'd punch you in the nose!\\
437 - Now just a minute, everybody.\\
438 - It's nobody's fault, really.\\
439 - It's just bad luck, that's all.\\
440 - Now we just got to go down there\\
441 - and get it before they wash it.\\
442 - Wash it?
Whoo.\\
443 - Yeah. Come on, let's go.\\
444 - Oh.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
445 - What?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.\\
446 - Well, it's no use\\
447 - all of us going down to the laundry.\\
448 - You go to the newspaper office\\
449 - and show them your half of the buck\\
450 - and then tell them\\
451 - that I'm coming right over with the
other half.\\
452 - LUCY: Yeah.\\
453 - RICKY: All right?\\
454 - No matter what happens, get that
bill.\\
455 - All right, now, well, we-we might...\\
456 - we might have to spend a few dollars
getting it.\\
457 - That's all right.\\
458 - We'll pay it out of the winnings.\\
459 - Okay, let's go.\\
460 - Okay.
Come on, let's go.\\
461 - Take a cab.\\
462 - We'll take a taxi.\\
463 - Oh.\\
464 - Uh, I'm Mr. Ricardo.\\
465 - I'm Mrs. Ricardo.
We'd like to...\\
466 - Just a minute.\\
467 - - I'm Mrs. Ricardo, - Look, I'm Mr.
Ricardo.\\
468 - - and I'd like to ask - We sent a
pajama here\\
469 - - if I could get something - We'd
like to get it back\\
470 - - that was in the laundry.
- Because we-we...\\
471 - weren't supposed to...\\
472 - Hup-up-up-up-up-up!\\
473 - Now, please,\\
474 - just one of you\\
475 - tell me your story in just plain
English.\\
476 - You.\\
477 - Well, you see, I-I found a bonus
buck,\\
478 - and I brought it home last night.\\
479 - I wanted to surprise my wife with it.\\
480 - Y la senora se lo dio al grocer.\\
481 - And then he took it downstairs,\\
482 - He gave it to the manager of the
apartment\\
483 - who's Mrs. Mertz\\
484 - in the change and then when they come
up\\
485 - she said she had found the bonus
buck.\\
486 - Actually, well, bonus buck\\
487 - que le puse en la cartera anoche.\\
488 - And then we had a big fight and then
we tore it up.\\
489 - She had a half, and we had a half\\
490 - and then we decided together\\
491 - maybe we'd go down to the newspaper
office\\
492 - and win the $300.\\
493 - Y entonces yo fui\\
494 - a un shower\\
495 - y la puse en el top de la pajama\\
496 - se lo dio al muchacho del laundry\\
497 - and it's here, we got to get it back.\\
498 - Look, you... you picked a fine one\\
499 - to tell you in plain English.\\
500 - Look, there's a little slip of paper
that's worth $300.\\
501 - It's in the pocket of my husband's
pajamas\\
502 - and I sent it to the laundry.\\
503 - Is that what you was trying to say?\\
504 - Now never mind that.\\
505 - I got to go in there and get it.\\
506 - Can't you even read plain English?\\
507 - Look. This is worth $300.\\
508 - Very important.\\
509 - We got to go in there.\\
510 - You ain't an employee\\
511 - and you can't go in there!\\
512 - I got my orders!\\
513 - Yeah, you're right, sir.
Forgive us.\\
514 - Forget all about it.\\
515 - It's all right, it's your job.
That's all right.\\
516 - Hey! Where's your number?\\
517 - Where are your slips?\\
518 - You can't go in there.\\
519 - You ain't an employee!\\
520 - Come back here, you rascal, you!\\
521 - You'll lose me my job!\\
522 - (yelling and screaming)\\
523 - I got them, Lucy!\\
524 - Get out! Honey, I got them!\\
525 - Let go of me!
Get out, Lucy!\\
526 - Honey, I got them!\\
527 - It's in the corner!\\
528 - Honey, our laundry bag's       Where?\\
529 - in the corner, right there.\\
530 - The blue one.\\
531 - Honey, where?\\
532 - The blue one, honey,	      Where?\\
533 - in the corner, yeah!\\
534 - WOMAN: Will you let go of me!\\
535 - RICKY: Just keep dancing.
Honey, don't worry.\\
536 - I got them!\\
537 - WOMAN: You're crazy!\\
538 - RICKY: Keep dancing, that's all!\\
539 - Attagirl.\\
540 - Go up the stairs!\\
541 - What are you doing?\\
542 - You did it now.\\
543 - Yeah, I got it!\\
544 - You got it, honey?
Fine.\\
545 - Where does this go?\\
546 - It goes to the starch vat!\\
547 - What?\\
548 - It goes\\
549 - to the starch vat!\\
550 - The starch vat!\\
551 - Ethel, it's almost 3:00.\\
552 - I don't think they're gonna make it.\\
553 - Oh, now, don't give up.
We still got one minute.\\
554 - All right. Now, for the last time,\\
555 - will you give me half the money if I
give you half the bill?\\
556 - For the last time, no!\\
557 - Aah!\\
558 - Ethel, cancel our subscription.\\
559 - We don't take this paper.\\
560 - Well, order a subscription\\
561 - and then cancel it.
Oh...\\
562 - Did I make it?\\
563 - Where's Lucy?\\
564 - She's having a little trouble coming
up the stairs.\\
565 - Here it is.\\
566 - What happened to it?\\
567 - Well, she had it with her\\
568 - when it fell in the starch vat.\\
569 - Oh, let me have it.
Come on.\\
570 - I haven't got it.
Where's yours?!\\
571 - I haven't got it!\\
572 - What do you mean you haven't got it?!\\
573 - There it is.
Here it is.\\
574 - There it is.\\
575 - Give me the money!
Give me the money!\\
576 - You made it.
Hurry up!	Congratulations!\\
577 - Ah, we won! We won!\\
578 - (all guffawing)\\
579 - Ay-yi-yi!\\
580 - We made it.\\
581 - Now listen, Fred.\\
582 - We had a few little expenses, you
know.\\
583 - Yeah?
Yeah?\\
584 - Remember you say we pay them out of
the winnings.\\
585 - Yeah.
Sure, I remember.\\
586 - Okay. Well, it was $29 for the
taxicab.\\
587 - $29?\\
588 - Yeah, well, we told him to wait for
us, you know.\\
589 - Oh, yeah.\\
590 - We couldn't take a chance.
Yeah.\\
591 - And then we had to give $10 to the
fellow\\
592 - down at the laundry for his overalls
and his cap.\\
593 - Yeah.
We had to sneak in the laundry,\\
594 - you know, to get her to give back.\\
595 - Yeah, so?
And then we gave\\
596 - the taxicab driver an extra $25\\
597 - to get us here in time.\\
598 - Extra $25?\\
599 - Yes. Well, we didn't want to take a
chance\\
600 - in not getting here, you know?\\
601 - And a $50 fine for speeding.\\
602 - Fifty dollars?!\\
603 - We were going awful fast.\\
604 - Yeah.\\
605 - And then all the damage at the
laundry.\\
606 - Damage?\\
607 - Yeah. We-we messed the place up
pretty bad.\\
608 - H-H-How much was that?\\
609 - That's $185.\\
610 - $185?!\\
611 - Yeah. I'll count it out, wait a
minute.\\
612 - 185, and 50 for cab...\\
613 - Is there gonna be anything...?\\
614 - How much... how much have we got
left?\\
615 - Yeah.\\
616 - One dollar?!\\
617 - Oh, no!\\

\subsection {Episode 22: Ricky's Hawaiian Vacation}
1 - (I Love Lucy theme music plays)\\
2 - MAN (on TV): And now, Mrs. Weston,\\
3 - here's a picture of the new house our
sponsor is giving you\\
4 - to take the place of your house that
burned down.\\
5 - You didn't expect that, did you?\\
6 - Now, don't cry, Mrs. Weston.\\
7 - There's nothing to cry about.\\
8 - I have so much fun every day\\
9 - giving people things that they need.\\
10 - We're giving you this new house for
the one that burned down\\
11 - when it caught fire from the candles
on the birthday cake\\
12 - of your little son, George.\\
13 - And a whole new set of furniture.\\
14 - Isn't that wonderful?\\
15 - And a whole new wardrobe for the
entire family.\\
16 - And you have Mrs. Cleo Morgan to
thank for this\\
17 - because she was such a good sport and
a good neighbor.\\
18 - Well, we'll see you tomorrow, folks,\\
19 - with another Good Neighbor program.\\
20 - Hi.\\
21 - Oh, hi.\\
22 - This is such an entertaining program.\\
23 - Oh, it looked like a million laughs.\\
24 - No, it really is.\\
25 - They do so many wonderful things for
people.\\
26 - I'm just mad about that program.\\
27 - Look how much mail you got today.\\
28 - Oh, thanks.\\
29 - Gee, here's one for Ricky postmarked
"Honolulu."\\
30 - Honolulu?\\
31 - Yeah. Didn't you know?\\
32 - Why, Lucy, you know I never look at
your mail.\\
33 - Oh. I wonder where it's from.\\
34 - Mr. Jensen of the Royal Hawaiian.\\
35 - Uh... it says so on the back flap.\\
36 - I wonder who he is.\\
37 - Hey, the flap's open a little bit.\\
38 - Maybe I can get it open some more.\\
39 - Nope, it's stuck tight.\\
40 - Can you see anything?\\
41 - No, this envelope is so thick.\\
42 - It looks exciting, doesn't it?\\
43 - Look at all those things.\\
44 - Too bad we couldn't get the flap
open.\\
45 - Yeah. Well, maybe we could.\\
46 - You never can tell...
Ah!\\
47 - Cut it out, will you?\\
48 - Eh, good morning, Ricky.\\
49 - Oh!\\
50 - Good morning.\\
51 - Oh, hi, Ricky.\\
52 - We were just trying to find out\\
53 - if this letter was really for you.\\
54 - The name's kind of blurred.\\
55 - Yeah, yeah, it's for you.\\
56 - Yeah, Ricky Ricardo.\\
57 - Yeah.\\
58 - That's me.\\
59 - Mm...\\
60 - Oh...\\
61 - Oh...\\
62 - Uh, I'm late for rehearsal.\\
63 - I'll eat down at the club.
Good-bye.\\
64 - But, Ricky...\\
65 - Yeah?\\
66 - What about the letter?\\
67 - Oh, it wasn't important.\\
68 - Wasn't important?\\
69 - No, it's just business, honey.\\
70 - Some millionaire, he wants me to take
the band\\
71 - down to Hawaii with some entertainers\\
72 - and play a dance.\\
73 - He says it wasn't important.\\
74 - My goodness, that's exciting.\\
75 - I've never been to Hawaii.\\
76 - Neither have I.\\
77 - Oh, Ricky, we have to figure out some
way\\
78 - so that we can take Fred and Ethel
along with us, too.\\
79 - "Too"?\\
80 - Yeah, "too," as in "besides me."\\
81 - Aw, now, Ricky, you wouldn't go to
Hawaii without me.\\
82 - Honey, we're only going for one
night.\\
83 - We're coming right back.\\
84 - I don't care.\\
85 - A short trip is better than no trip
at all.\\
86 - Besides, you said you needed some
entertainers.\\
87 - We could be the entertainers.\\
88 - What are you going to call
yourselves--\\
89 - "The Deadweight Trio"?\\
90 - Well, thanks a lot.\\
91 - Now, wait a minute, Ethel, don't get
mad.\\
92 - This is no time to antagonize him.\\
93 - Now, listen, give me just one good
reason\\
94 - why we can't all go to Hawaii.\\
95 - Because I can't afford it, honey.\\
96 - I'm not making any money on this job.\\
97 - I'm losing money.\\
98 - I'm just taking it for the publicity
value.\\
99 - Now, good-bye.\\
100 - Oh, Ricky...\\
101 - Well, that's that.\\
102 - Oh, no, it isn't.\\
103 - I'm not giving up so easy.\\
104 - Huh?\\
105 - Oh, for once, I'm glad to see that
gleam in your eye.\\
106 - What do you have in mind?\\
107 - Well, first, we've got to prove\\
108 - that we're good enough to take along.\\
109 - Yeah?
But how?\\
110 - How?\\
111 - Yeah, now, let me see...\\
112 - LUCY: Ricky, is that you?\\
113 - Yeah.\\
114 - Presenting a night in Hawaii!\\
115 - (tropical dance music playing)\\
116 - King Kamehameha\\
117 - The conqueror of the islands\\
118 - Became a famous hero one day\\
119 - He bought a native army\\
120 - And he pushed it over the poly\\
121 - And crowned himself king of
Hawaii-ee-aa\\
122 - And when the fray was over, he took
the islands over\\
123 - And this is what he had to say\\
124 - Aa-ee-ooky-laa-ee-wahie\\
125 - Aa-ee-ooky-laa-ee-wahie\\
126 - Aa-waa-Hawaii-ee-aa\\
127 - And on his throne, he sat alone\\
128 - Waiting for a big luau\\
129 - The royal maidens stared\\
130 - Were gathered there\\
131 - To greet him with the grand
halakay-ow-oh\\
132 - Oh, King Kamehameha\\
133 - The conqueror of the islands\\
134 - Became a famous hero one day\\
135 - He bought a native army\\
136 - And he pushed it over the poly\\
137 - And right, oh, up, ee-oo-ee-aa\\
138 - (screeching melody)\\
139 - (off-key high note)\\
140 - Now, now, listen to me, girls.\\
141 - Would-Would you listen a minute?\\
142 - Just a minute.
You haven't seen anything yet.\\
143 - (music plays)\\
144 - (rhythmic chanting)\\
145 - Away, ay!\\
146 - Away, ay!\\
147 - Away, ay!\\
148 - Away, ay! Ay!\\
149 - (rhythmic chanting)\\
150 - Ay!\\
151 - (rhythmic chanting)\\
152 - Ay!\\
153 - (rhythmic chanting)\\
154 - Hey!\\
155 - (rhythmic chanting)\\
156 - You liked it?\\
157 - Very good!\\
158 - You liked it, huh?\\
159 - Oh, I think you were wonderful!\\
160 - He liked it!
He liked it!\\
161 - Oh, you were just great!\\
162 - Yeah.
Thank you.\\
163 - Gee, it's too bad I can't take you
with me.\\
164 - But you said you liked it.\\
165 - Yeah!\\
166 - I did, honey.\\
167 - I think you were just great.\\
168 - Well, then, why can't we go?\\
169 - Well, honey, if there's one thing\\
170 - that they don't need in Hawaii,\\
171 - it's Hawaiian dancers.\\
172 - Ew...\\
173 - Now, the troupe that I'm taking down
there\\
174 - is made up of Latin American
entertainers.\\
175 - Ay, ay, ay, ay...
La cucaracha...\\
176 - Ay, ay, ay, ay...
La cucaracha...\\
177 - Just a minute!\\
178 - Just a minute, everybody.\\
179 - Now, I'm sorry,\\
180 - but Mr. Jensen already told me who he
wants\\
181 - and I already hired them.\\
182 - Oh, now, Ricky...\\
183 - Now, Ricky, I don't see why you...\\
184 - No, no, no, save your breath. Save
your breath.\\
185 - Of course, this is only a hunch on my
part,\\
186 - but I don't believe he wants to take
us with him.\\
187 - It's not that, Fred.\\
188 - It's just that I can't.\\
189 - Why not?\\
190 - Well, honey, I can't afford it.\\
191 - I'm losing money on the job.\\
192 - I-I just can't do it.\\
193 - There's nothing I can do about it.\\
194 - And so, as the sun sinks slowly\\
195 - into the waters of the blue Pacific,\\
196 - we give up the only chance we had to
go to Hawaii.\\
197 - Hi.
Hi.\\
198 - What are you doing?\\
199 - Ethel, I have just had the greatest
idea of my career.\\
200 - You know that show\\
201 - where they do all kinds of crazy
stunts\\
202 - to help their needy friends?\\
203 - You mean that show you were looking
at the other day,\\
204 - the Freddie Fillmore show?\\
205 - Be a Good Neighbor.\\
206 - Listen to this: "Dear Freddie
Fillmore,\\
207 - "I have been watching your show Be a
Good Neighbor\\
208 - "for a long time, and I think it is
wonderful what you do\\
209 - "for all the people who appear on
your show.\\
210 - "I want to tell you about a neighbor
of mine.\\
211 - "She is the sweetest, the dearest,\\
212 - "the most understanding person I ever
knew,\\
213 - "and she is completely unselfish.\\
214 - "She's always thinking of other
people before herself.\\
215 - Now, this person is terribly poor..."\\
216 - Now, wait a minute.\\
217 - You have to say something like that.\\
218 - Uh, now\\
219 - "this person is terribly poor,\\
220 - "and she can't afford any luxuries
for herself,\\
221 - "but it's always been the dream of
her life\\
222 - "to go to the Hawaiian islands.\\
223 - "So...\\
224 - "I'm wondering if I couldn't appear\\
225 - "on Be a Good Neighbor\\
226 - "in order that this unselfish,
generous,\\
227 - "sweet neighbor may realize her
dream--\\
228 - "a trip to Honolulu.\\
229 - Sincerely yours, Ethel Mertz."\\
230 - Why, you mean thing.\\
231 - Now, just a minute...\\
232 - Why, I was practically back in that
Hawaiian costume.\\
233 - What a fine friend you turned out to
be.\\
234 - Now, Ethel, the minute I won that
trip,\\
235 - I was going to ask them to let me
take Fred and Ethel Mertz with me.\\
236 - Oh, sure.\\
237 - I was, and if I couldn't take you
with me,\\
238 - I was going to send you a postcard.\\
239 - Oh, never mind.\\
240 - Oh, now, Ethel, come on, what do you
say?\\
241 - This is what I say.\\
242 - Ethel Mertz!\\
243 - You just tore up my ticket to
Honolulu.\\
244 - Well, according to that letter,\\
245 - you're so sweet and thoughtful,\\
246 - it won't make any difference.\\
247 - Oh, Ethel!\\
248 - Well, that's one of the worst things
you've ever done to me.\\
249 - What do you mean, done to you?\\
250 - There I was thinking all the time\\
251 - that maybe you...
What have I done to you?\\
252 - Hey, what's going on here?\\
253 - She's forging my name.\\
254 - That's what's going on here.
What?\\
255 - All I did was write that show Be a
Good Neighbor\\
256 - and have Ethel ask them if I could go
to Honolulu.\\
257 - Well, now, that doesn't seem so bad,
Ethel.\\
258 - Oh, no? Did you ever see that show?\\
259 - Do you know what kind of stunts you
have to do?\\
260 - I'd get a pie in my face.\\
261 - She'd get an all-expense cruise.\\
262 - She'd be over there sitting on the
beach\\
263 - and I'd be home combing meringue out
of my hair.\\
264 - So, you'd be a little uncomfortable
for a while.\\
265 - I'd do it for her.\\
266 - Yeah, she'd do it for you.\\
267 - Well, then let her.\\
268 - Okay, I will.\\
269 - Well, that's swell.\\
270 - Watch out for a trick.\\
271 - Please, Ethel, you hurt my feelings.\\
272 - Yeah. Ethel, I'm surprised at you.\\
273 - Now, look, I'll write a letter to
Freddie Fillmore\\
274 - and I'll tell him that there's a
lovely couple\\
275 - who live across the hall from me who
are very poor\\
276 - but they're so good and kind to
everyone\\
277 - that I think he should give them a
trip to Honolulu...\\
278 - Aw...
Aw...\\
279 - with their teenage daughter.\\
280 - What?!\\
281 - Now what's wrong with that?\\
282 - I told you to watch out for a trick.\\
283 - I'm not going to Honolulu as Lucy's
mother.\\
284 - That's what's wrong with that.\\
285 - Oh, listen, if it'll get us to
Honolulu,\\
286 - I'll go as her mother.\\
287 - Oh...
Oh, Ethel, if you're going to be
silly\\
288 - how about me going as your mother?\\
289 - Well, that's more like it.\\
290 - All right.\\
291 - I'll tell Freddie Fillmore\\
292 - that I know a lovely couple who are
very poor\\
293 - but they've taken care of their dear,
old gray-haired mother\\
294 - all their life.\\
295 - Dear Freddie Fillmore...\\
296 - Come on, Ethel.\\
297 - I'm ready.\\
298 - Come on.\\

303 - Honolulu!
Oh, we're in!\\

Before you start packing,\\
306 - I think there's something you ought
to know.\\
307 - What?
He's coming over to see me,\\
308 - but he wants to interview the
poverty-stricken couple\\
309 - and their gray-haired mother.\\
310 - Oh, no.
Oh, yes.\\
311 - I knew it was too good to be true.\\
312 - Well, wait a minute now.\\
313 - We've been in worse jams than this.\\
314 - Yes, thanks to you.\\
315 - Well, just give me time to think,

495 - Now, Mr. and Mrs. Mertz,\\
496 - I want you to go right over there\\
497 - and sit down in those two chairs\\
498 - on the opposite side of the stage, if
you will.\\
499 - All right.\\
500 - Okay.\\
501 - FILLMORE: Right over there.\\
502 - Sit right down in them.\\
503 - Right there.\\
504 - Now, lean back, relax.\\
505 - Those are reclining chairs.\\
506 - There, aren't you comfortable?\\
507 - Oh, yeah.\\
508 - Oh, fine.\\
509 - Now, we're going to see if Mrs.
Ricardo\\
510 - can win this trip to Honolulu for

511 - And, Mrs. Ricardo, we have a real
surprise for you.\\
512 - Oh?
We have a friend of yours here today.\\
513 - A friend of mine?\\
514 - Yes. You see, when we told him\\
515 - about Mr. and Mrs. Mertz and their
dear old mother,\\
516 - he insisted on coming down here and
helping you out.\\
517 - Oh.
Wasn't that nice?\\
518 - Send him out here, boys.\\
519 - LUCY: Ricky!\\
520 - FILLMORE: That's right-- your
husband,\\
521 - bandleader Ricky Ricardo.\\
522 - Oh...\\
523 - (applause)\\
524 - Um... are you sure he's going to help
me?\\
525 - Of course, dear.
Oh.\\
526 - Oh, as a matter of face, he's going
to do most of the work.\\
527 - Now, here's what I want you to do.\\
528 - Mrs. Ricardo, I want you to get right
up there in that circle\\
529 - where you can get your hand on that
cord.\\
530 - And Mr. Ricardo, right up here, if
you will.\\
531 - Yes, sir.\\
532 - There we are.\\
533 - Now, what I want you to do\\
534 - is think of a song with something
physical\\
535 - in it, like, uh...
Well, uh, rain.\\
536 - I get the blues when it rains\\
537 - And the blues I can't lose...\\
538 - I know the song.
You don't have to sing it.\\
539 - You know it.\\
540 - Oh, that's such a beautiful suit.\\
541 - We wouldn't want anything to happen
to that.\\
542 - Boys, I think we'd better give him a
slicker, huh?\\
543 - Now, wait just a minute...\\
544 - Oh, now, you're willing to do this
for your neighbors,\\
545 - aren't you?
RICKY: For the neighbors?\\
546 - Well, sure you are.\\
547 - Now, wait just a minute.\\
548 - I don't know.\\
549 - Oh, of course you will.\\
550 - There we are.
All right.\\
551 - Now I think we're all set.\\
552 - Mrs. Ricardo, every time he says the
word "rain..."\\
553 - Yeah?\\
554 - you pull that cord.\\
555 - Oh, okay.\\
556 - You got the idea?\\
557 - Yeah, I got it.
All set.\\
558 - Mrs. Ricardo, you know what to do.\\
559 - I sure do.
Okay!\\
560 - All right, go ahead and sing.\\
561 - I get the blues when it rains...\\
562 - Yeah, boy...!\\
563 - All of the...\\
564 - Wait a minute, wait a minute.\\
565 - What's he got the slicker on for?\\
566 - Well, I was afraid some of that rain\\
567 - might splash and get on him.\\
568 - Well, thanks a lot.\\
569 - Oh, and there's one other thing\\
570 - I forgot to tell you, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
571 - If you step outside of that circle\\
572 - at any time during the stunt\\
573 - your friends don't get the trip to
Honolulu.\\
574 - Well, isn't it over?\\
575 - Over? We haven't even started yet.\\
576 - Well, what was all that rain stuff?\\
577 - (laughter)\\
578 - Oh, that's just a little test.\\
579 - Oh.\\
580 - Oh, uh, Ricky, here's what I want you
to do.\\
581 - I have a list of words here--\\
582 - things, oh, like leaves, feathers,
stuff like that.\\
583 - Now, I want you to see how many songs\\
584 - you can think of that contain those
words,\\
585 - and every time you sing one of those
songs,\\
586 - you push your friends just a little
closer to Honolulu.\\
587 - And if within the two-minute time
limit,\\
588 - you can think of enough songs\\
589 - and Mrs. Ricardo doesn't step outside
of that circle,\\
590 - then the Mertzes get the trip to
Honolulu, you understand?\\
591 - Yeah, I got it.\\
592 - Okay, now you've got exactly two
minutes.\\
593 - Okay.
Go!\\
594 - All right.\\
595 - Um...\\
596 - I'm putting all my eggs\\
597 - In one basket...\\
598 - They're in Detroit.\\
599 - Uh...\\
600 - How deep is the ocean...\\
601 - Chicago.\\
602 - I'm in love with you...\\
603 - Oh, no, not that! Not that!\\
604 - Honey...\\
605 - Oh, no!\\
606 - (bell rings)\\
607 - Denver!\\
608 - Say you love me...\\
609 - No, not again! Not again!\\
610 - Honey...\\
611 - Oh, no...\\
612 - (bell rings)\\
613 - West Denver!\\
614 - Just around the corner\\
615 - There's a rainbow in the sky\\
616 - So let's have another cup of
coffee...\\
617 - (bell rings)\\
618 - San Francisco, and you have five
seconds to go!\\
619 - Hurry up!\\
620 - Five seconds, huh?\\
621 - Let's have another piece of...\\
622 - Um... um...\\
623 - Come on!\\
624 - Come on, come on!
(bell rings)\\
625 - Sorry. Time's up.\\

\subsection {Episode 23: Lucy is Envious}
1 - (I Love Lucy theme music playing)\\
2 - Here.\\
3 - Thanks.\\
4 - Oh, the opera opened last night.\\
5 - Will you look at that.\\
6 - The lobby looks like a field of
waving mink.\\
7 - Gee, and all the parties they went to
afterward--\\
8 - 21 and El Morocco...\\
9 - Gosh, I bet they had a good time.\\
10 - Lucy...\\
11 - Huh?\\
12 - Why do you envy those people?\\
13 - I don't envy them.\\
14 - I just wish I could dress like them\\
15 - and live the way they do, that's all.\\
16 - Honey, the only way to be real happy\\
17 - is to be satisfied with what you got.\\
18 - Oh? What have I got?\\
19 - Me.\\
20 - My cup runneth over.\\
21 - Well!\\
22 - Thank you.\\
23 - Oh, no.\\
24 - What happened?\\
25 - "Cynthia Harcourt just got back from
Europe\\
26 - and is in town on a charity drive."\\
27 - So? What's that to you?\\
28 - Oh, I went to school with her.\\
29 - Oh.\\
30 - She had nothing but money, and she
married money.\\
31 - Seemed like such a waste to me.\\
32 - Money always marries money.\\
33 - Yeah. Why doesn't money ever marry
broke?\\
34 - Who knows?\\
35 - Well, if she's on a charity drive,\\
36 - I just won't answer the phone for a
few days.\\
37 - She always calls up all the girls she
went to school with\\
38 - and asks for contributions, you know.\\
39 - So let her call.\\
40 - She knows you're not wealthy.\\
41 - Well, I don't know.\\
42 - And where, pray say, did she get this
impression?\\
43 - From the same person that told her\\
44 - that you really own a big sugar
plantation in Cuba.\\
45 - Who is that?\\
46 - Someone we all know and love\\
47 - who ought to keep her big mouth shut.\\
48 - Now you see what I mean?\\
49 - You were envious of somebody.\\
50 - You tried to be something that you
weren't\\
51 - and now you're in trouble.\\
52 - You're right, Ricky.\\
53 - I'm never gonna be envious of anyone
again.\\
54 - Good.\\
55 - What if I'm not sitting in the lap of
luxury?\\
56 - I'm happy where I am-- on the bony
knees of nothing.\\
57 - I like bony knees.\\
58 - (phone ringing)\\
59 - Hello.\\
60 - Lucy, darling, this is Cynthia,
Cynthia Harcourt.\\
61 - Cynthia, dear.\\
62 - Oh, darling, it's so nice to speak to
you again.\\
63 - I can't believe I'm here.\\
64 - You know, only last night I was in
Paris.\\
65 - Oh?\\
66 - Oh, Paris!\\
67 - Give me Paris in the springtime.\\
68 - Isn't that the way you feel, dear?\\
69 - Oh, oui, oui.\\
70 - Oh! Vous parlez francais?\\
71 - Huh?\\
72 - Parlez-vous francais?\\
73 - How's that again?\\
74 - Do you speak French?\\
75 - Oh, yes. Fluently.\\
76 - Oh, Lucy, you're so droll.\\
77 - (Lucy laughing)\\
78 - Well, tell me, dear.\\
79 - You know, we're staying in a hotel
now,\\
80 - but Cyrus is thinking of moving to
New York\\
81 - and I was wondering--\\
82 - how's the servant problem?\\
83 - The servant problem?\\
84 - Yes.\\
85 - Oh, frightful, darling.\\
86 - I just don't know what to do about
it.\\
87 - Well, do you think that I could get
by with a staff of ten?\\
88 - Oh, yes, I think you can get by with
a staff of ten.\\
89 - Well, how many do you have?\\
90 - Me? Oh, I have, uh...\\
91 - Well, do you have more than ten?\\
92 - Well, uh...
frankly, Cynthia.\\
93 - I think that you should know\\
94 - we live a very simple life.\\
95 - We have a tiny little place.\\
96 - We're just normal, average people.\\
97 - Oh.\\
98 - I'm going over to see Fred.\\
99 - Okay, dear.\\
100 - Well, how many do you have?\\
101 - Eight.\\
102 - Oh. My, you must have a tiny place.\\
103 - Well, uh, dear, this nasty, old money
business--\\
104 - you know I really hate it,\\
105 - but I'm chairman of the charity drive
this year,\\
106 - and I was wondering how much I could
count on you for?\\
107 - Well, Cynthia, I've given\\
108 - to so many charitable things this
year\\
109 - I've practically nothing left.\\
110 - Oh, Lucy, darling, I'd hate to print
your name in the book\\
111 - and put a zero after it.\\
112 - Yes. I'm sure you would, dear.\\
113 - Well, surely you can scrape a few
dollars together,\\
114 - like your classmates did.\\
115 - Anita gave seven, Adelle gave six\\
116 - and Hazel gave eight.\\
117 - Oh, I had no idea\\
118 - that such a sniggly little bit would
count.\\
119 - Oh, certainly, darling, everything
counts.\\
120 - Oh, well, put me down for five.\\
121 - Wonderful! Should I pop over and pick
it up?\\
122 - Uh, no. No.\\
123 - I'm going shopping today.\\
124 - I'd be glad to drop it by.\\
125 - Oh, fine. Wonderful.
I'll see you then, dear.\\
126 - All right. Where are you staying,
Cynthia?\\
127 - Cynthia?\\
128 - Oh, darn it.\\
129 - What's the matter?\\
130 - Oh... that was an old schoolmate of
mine,\\
131 - Cynthia Harcourt, and she's here\\
132 - on a charit...
The Cynthia Harcourt?\\
133 - Yeah.
Did you go to school with her?\\
134 - Yeah, and she's in town on a charity
drive.\\
135 - I promised to drop a check\\
136 - but I don't know where she's staying.\\
137 - Well, it told all about it in the
society column this morning.\\
138 - I was reading it.\\
139 - That's right.
I forgot.\\
140 - Yeah. She has a penthouse at the
Waldorf.\\
141 - Oh, gee. I've always wanted to see\\
142 - what a penthouse looked like.\\
143 - Want to go with me?\\
144 - Can I?\\
145 - Sure.\\
146 - Oh, boy, yes. Imagine me in high
society.\\
147 - Hi.\\
148 - (loftily): Oh, Frederic, darling,\\
149 - If you're looking for me this
afternoon, I shan't be home.\\
150 - I'll be at the penthouse at the
Waldorf.\\
151 - Well, she finally flipped.\\
152 - She did not.\\
153 - She's going with me to see an old
schoolmate\\
154 - who put the bite on me for a charity
drive.\\
155 - Lucy?\\
156 - Yeah?\\
157 - How much did she bit you for?\\
158 - Five measly dollars.\\
159 - I'm taking her a check.\\
160 - Why don't you mail it to her?\\
161 - Oh, because I want to see her
penthouse.\\
162 - I bet it's just fabulous.\\
163 - There you go again--\\
164 - wanting something that you haven't
got.\\
165 - I do not.
I just want to see\\
166 - what it is I haven't got that I don't
want.\\
167 - Okay, old man, we're going to go for
a nice walk.\\
168 - It's a beautiful day.\\
169 - Say good-bye to Mommy.\\
170 - Bye-bye, darling.\\
171 - Give me a kiss.\\
172 - You be a good boy, now.\\
173 - Now, honey, remember-- no hot dogs\\
174 - no peanuts, no popcorn.\\
175 - All right, how about a glass of beer?\\
176 - Oh!\\
177 - Come on, now, you keep him bundled
up, too.\\
178 - I think it might rain today, dear.\\
179 - Yes, ma'am.\\
180 - Well, now, be careful with him.\\
181 - I will.
Oh, hi, honey.
You going out?\\
182 - Yeah. He's going for a walk.\\
183 - Come on, Fred, you want to walk with
us, man?\\
184 - Okay. Come on, champ.
Come on, we'll take you.\\
185 - Now, honey, keep him bundled up.\\
186 - All right, Mother, all right.
Good-bye.\\
187 - Bye-bye, darling.\\
188 - Come on. Are you ready?\\
189 - Yeah, just about. I got the check all
made out here.\\
190 - I got to take one last look and see
if I'm all right.\\
191 - I put this flower on my hat.\\
192 - Do you think it's okay?\\
193 - ETHEL: Oh, I think you look great.\\
194 - All right.\\
195 - You didn't say anything about how I
look.\\
196 - Lucy, darling!\\
197 - Oh! Cynthia!\\
198 - Oh, Cynthia, uh...\\
199 - Uh, Ethel, this is Cynthia Harcourt.\\
200 - This is Ethel Mertz.\\
201 - Oh. Charmed.\\
202 - Ooh, likewise.\\
203 - Well, you know, darling, I realized
after I spoke with you on the phone\\
204 - that I hadn't told you where we were
staying.\\
205 - So I thought I'd just pop over
myself.\\
206 - Oh, well, I'm awfully glad you did,
Cynthia.\\
207 - You'll have to forgive the way the
place looks.\\
208 - I... well, I-I just flew into a nasty
rage this morning\\
209 - and fired all the servants.\\
210 - Didn't I, Ethel.\\
211 - All of 'em.\\
212 - You know, dear, I've been thinking.\\
213 - Really, maybe I shouldn't have phoned
you\\
214 - to ask you for money.\\
215 - I mean, you know\\
216 - with the tiny, little place you have
here\\
217 - and being a bandleader's wife and
all,\\
218 - maybe you can't afford it.\\
219 - Oh, nonsense, Cynthia.\\
220 - This dump is just a place for Ricky
to hang his clothes.\\
221 - We spend most of our time in the
country.\\
222 - Oh, this is your town house?\\
223 - Well, it's really our town closet.\\
224 - Yes. We have a beautiful summer
place--\\
225 - a big mansion, stables, and swimming
pool.\\
226 - And tennis courts.\\
227 - Oh, delightful... sounds like our
summer place.\\
228 - Where's yours?\\
229 - Um... where's yours?\\
230 - Bucks County.\\
231 - Oh, ours is in Westchester.\\
232 - Oh, wonderful. We must come and visit
you soon.\\
233 - Oh, well, that would be lovely,
Cynthia,\\
234 - except that we don't expect\\
235 - to spend much time there this season.\\
236 - You're going to Florida.\\
237 - Why not?\\
238 - Well, so are we.\\
239 - Oh.\\
240 - Where do you go in Florida?\\
241 - Miami or West Palm Beach?\\
242 - Uh, you go West Palm Beach, huh?\\
243 - Miami.\\
244 - Oh, we go West Palm Beach.\\
245 - But, darling, the harbor's so small
there.\\
246 - What do you do with your yacht?\\
247 - To make it fit, we crank down the
smokestack\\
248 - and squeeze in the poop deck.\\
249 - Oh, Lucy, you are droll.\\
250 - Oh, droll is the word.\\
251 - Well, really, I hate to be crass\\
252 - but I suppose we should get down to
business.\\
253 - Oh, yes.\\
254 - Do sit down, Cynthia.\\
255 - Thank you.\\
256 - Now, I'll get out my little book
here.\\
257 - Now, let me see.\\
258 - Yes...
"Lucille McGillicuddy Ricardo."\\
259 - Now, you said on the phone you were
going to give five.\\
260 - Is that right?
That's right.\\
261 - You can put me down for five, too.\\
262 - Oh, marvelous, Mrs. Hertz.\\
263 - Thank you.\\
264 - It's Mertz.\\
265 - You spell it with an "M."\\
266 - Oh? Oh, thank you.\\
267 - "Mrs. Mertz-- five hundred... "\\
268 - LUCY: Uh...\\
269 - Oh, uh... Cynthia...\\
270 - W-W-We didn't really mean 500.\\
271 - Five thousand?\\
272 - Oh, no.\\
273 - Well, you...\\
274 - you certainly couldn't have meant
five dollars.\\
275 - Oh, no.\\
276 - Well, what did you mean?\\
277 - I... I guess we meant 500.\\
278 - Well, are you going to give me your
check now, dear?\\
279 - Oh, uh, no.\\
280 - No. I'll have to send you the check.\\
281 - My business manager makes out all my
checks.\\
282 - Oh, fine. Well, I'm at the Waldorf.\\
283 - Yes.\\
284 - Your check, Mrs. Mertz?\\
285 - Oh, her business manager makes out
all my checks, too.\\
286 - Oh?\\
287 - I just love his handwriting.\\
288 - Oh, well...
very well.\\
289 - I'll hear from you then.\\
290 - Oh, yes, Cynthia. Yes.\\
291 - I'm so glad that you came by, dear.\\
292 - It's wonderful seeing you again.\\
293 - Good-bye.\\
294 - Good-bye.\\
295 - (gasping)\\
296 - $500... each!\\
297 - Hi.\\
298 - Hi.\\
299 - How'd you do?\\
300 - All I could find was 76 cents\\
301 - in one of Fred's old coats.\\
302 - What are you doing?\\
303 - I'm checking the local branch of the
first national couch.\\
304 - You find anything?\\
305 - 51 cents, a button, a nail file\\
306 - and an old piece of Christmas candy.\\
307 - Not much of a start toward $1,000, is
it?\\
308 - No. I even opened the baby's piggy
bank.\\
309 - What'd you find?\\
310 - Three IOUs from Ricky.\\
311 - Oh, fine.\\
312 - Well, we better just send her\\
313 - our checks for five dollars\\
314 - and forget about it.\\
315 - Forget about it?\\
316 - Do you want your name in that little
book\\
317 - with "five dollars" printed after it?\\
318 - Why not? For me that's good.\\
319 - Well, for me it isn't.\\
320 - All the girls I went to school with\\
321 - will see that book\\
322 - and I told them all that Ricky's
loaded.\\
323 - I just got to get my hands on $500.\\
324 - Hey-- would you be willing to work
for it?\\
325 - Sure.\\
326 - Well, Billboard always has a lot of
ads in it\\
327 - wanting people for different things.\\
328 - Let's see if there's anything in here
we could do.\\
329 - Here.\\
330 - Hey, there's something you could do.\\
331 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
332 - Not even for sweet charity\\
333 - am I going to box three rounds\\
334 - with a kangaroo.\\
335 - Let me take that.\\
336 - (sighing)\\
337 - "Need two girls with courage\\
338 - "for publicity stunt.\\
339 - High pay for right parties."\\
340 - Ah, no.\\
341 - What's the matter, haven't you got
courage?\\
342 - Yeah, I got courage, but it says they
need girls.\\
343 - Well, we're girls.\\
344 - We are?\\
345 - If you divide everybody\\
346 - into boys and girls, we're girls.\\
347 - I never thought about it like that.\\
348 - I'm going to call up and find out
about this ad.\\
349 - Okay.
This might be something we could do.\\
350 - Courage for what, I wonder.\\
351 - Hello? Hello.\\
352 - I'm calling about your ad in
Billboard--\\
353 - "two girls with courage."\\
354 - Yes, sir.\\
355 - Oh, yes. Yes, we can keep a secret.\\
356 - Oh, plenty of courage.\\
357 - Yes, sir.\\
358 - All right.\\
359 - 623 East 68th Street, apartment 3D.\\
360 - All right, sir.\\
361 - Well?\\
362 - He's coming right over.\\
363 - (door buzzer)\\
364 - Hello.\\
365 - Hi. Al Sparks is the name.\\
366 - Oh.\\
367 - Well, where are the girls?\\
368 - We're the girls.\\
369 - Oh.\\
370 - Yes, this is Ethel Mertz.\\
371 - I'm Lucy Ricardo.\\
372 - How do you do.\\
373 - Won't you sit down?\\
374 - Yeah...\\
375 - Yeah, I, uh...\\
376 - I guess you'll do.\\
377 - I guess it doesn't make any
difference\\
378 - as long as you're coming from Mars.\\
379 - Mars?!\\
380 - Yeah.\\
381 - So long, Lucy.\\
382 - Ethel.\\
383 - Did you say "coming from Mars"?\\
384 - Yeah, that's right.\\
385 - You see, tomorrow night, my studio is
having\\
386 - a premiere of a new picture-- Women
From Mars.\\
387 - Uh-huh.
Yeah.\\
388 - Well, tomorrow afternoon, two Martian
women\\
389 - are going to land in New York,\\
390 - abduct an earthman, and disappear.\\
391 - Now, that's where you come in.\\
392 - That's where I go out.\\
393 - Ethel, now sit down.\\
394 - Now, don't worry.
I got every angle figured.\\
395 - Well, tell it to her.\\
396 - Ethel, honey, you've got to do this
with me.\\
397 - No.\\
398 - Think of my reputation.\\
399 - No.\\
400 - There's 500 bucks in it for each of
you.\\
401 - Okay.\\
402 - What do we do?\\
403 - Now, here's the way I got it figured.\\
404 - The first thing we do is sneak up to
the top\\
405 - of the Empire State Building.\\
406 - The top of the Empire State
Building?!\\
407 - Well, Martha, we finally made it.\\
408 - Oh, yes, Henry--\\
409 - the top of the Empire State Building.\\
410 - You know, Martha, this is the tallest
building in the world.\\
411 - Henry, give me a dime.\\
412 - All right.\\
413 - Just a minute.\\
414 - There you are, dear.\\
415 - Oh, I can't find it.\\
416 - Well, what are you looking for,
Martha?\\
417 - Wichita.\\
418 - Oh, Martha.\\
419 - Anybody knows Wichita is over that
way.\\
420 - Oh.\\
421 - Now point it up.\\
422 - See anything?\\
423 - No.\\
424 - A little higher. Look.\\
425 - See?\\
426 - Seen any flying saucers yet?\\
427 - Flying saucers?\\
428 - You don't mean there really are such
things?\\
429 - Well, I don't know.\\
430 - There've been a lot of rumors lately.\\
431 - People think spaceships are coming
down from Mars and landing on Earth.\\
432 - Oh, nonsense.\\
433 - What's the matter?\\
434 - Thought I saw something flash by just
now.\\
435 - It was probably nothing.\\
436 - Look through there.\\
437 - See if you can see anything.\\
438 - Little lower.
Little lower.\\
439 - SPARKS: That may not be smoke.\\
440 - Look right through there, look.\\
441 - I don't see anything either.\\
442 - SPARKS: Well, I think I saw one.\\
443 - Look right through here, Martha.\\
444 - Right out through here.\\
445 - Little higher.\\
446 - No, it's a little lower, a little
lower than that.\\
447 - I can't see a thing.\\
448 - You can't?\\
449 - MAN: I don't think there's anything
up there, really I don't.\\
450 - Certainly looked like I saw
something.\\
451 - (speaking gibberish)\\
452 - (laughing)\\
453 - (laughing)\\
454 - (speaking gibberish)\\
455 - What are they?\\
456 - Th-th-they look like women from Mars.\\
457 - (chattering)\\
458 - (laughing and chattering)\\
459 - (screams)\\
460 - Now, now, let's not get hysterical.\\
461 - Maybe we can talk to them.\\
462 - Pardon me.\\
463 - Are... are you from Mars?\\
464 - (speaking gibberish)\\
465 - Just a minute.\\
466 - Anybody ready to go down?\\
467 - Me?\\
468 - Watch out!\\
469 - That's a paralyzing ray.\\
470 - (laughing)\\
471 - Hey, Rick, where are the girls?\\
472 - I don't know.
When I got home,\\
473 - Mrs. Trumbull was with the baby.\\
474 - What's the matter?\\
475 - What's the matter?\\
476 - We're being invaded from outer space.\\
477 - What?\\
478 - It's on every radio and television.\\
479 - A flying saucer landed on the Empire
State Building.\\
480 - 40 Martians got out and captured an
earthman.\\
481 - I think you've been working too hard.\\
482 - Come on, come on.\\
483 - Let's go up on the roof\\
484 - and protect our home and loved ones.\\
485 - I'll go get Little Ricky.\\
486 - He's never seen a flying saucer
before.\\
487 - And bring your binoculars.\\
488 - Bring the binoculars.
Now, come on.\\
489 - Yes, sir.
Come on.\\
490 - Right away.\\
491 - (chuckling): Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.\\
492 - Hey, Little Ricky,\\
493 - you want to go and see some flying
saucers?\\
494 - All right, girls\\
495 - I'm going to get right out of here.\\
496 - Here you are, here's your money.\\
497 - $500 apiece.
Thank you very much.\\
498 - Okay, I haven't got time to wait for
you to change,\\
499 - so I'll pick the uniforms up later.\\
500 - Okay.
You were great.\\
501 - Bye.
Bye.\\
502 - (both laughing)\\
503 - (speaking gibberish)\\
504 - ...Sechs, sieben, acht, neun.\\
505 - How are things on Mars?\\
506 - Very wealthy.\\
507 - Change?\\
508 - Change.\\
509 - Change.\\
510 - (speaking gibberish)\\
511 - "New York invaded by Martian women.\\
512 - "Hordes of invaders also seen\\
513 - in New Jersey and Connecticut."\\
514 - One man in Connecticut saw 20 of us.\\
515 - (laughing)\\
516 - Oh, look at those headlines.\\
517 - Lucy?\\
518 - What?\\
519 - You don't suppose this is all\\
520 - a horrible coincidence, do you?\\
521 - What do you mean?\\
522 - Well, all that Martian talk--\\
523 - people thinking they've seen
Martians.\\
524 - You don't suppose some real Martians\\
525 - decided to come down on Earth\\
526 - at the same time we pulled this
stunt, do you?\\
527 - Oh, that's silly...\\
528 - isn't it?\\
529 - I don't know.\\
530 - I just wish Fred was home.\\
531 - Gee, I wish Ricky was home, too.\\
532 - Oh, why did you have to say all that?\\
533 - Now I got a spooky feeling about
everything.\\
534 - Well, all those...
Oh, dear.\\
535 - (thumping and squealing)\\
536 - What's that?\\
537 - What's that?\\
538 - I don't know.\\
539 - (thumping and squealing continues)\\
540 - That's a horrible noise.\\
541 - (noise stops)\\
542 - (both screaming)\\
543 - Call the police.\\
544 - (screaming)\\
545 - Get the police.\\
546 - We can't call the police.\\
547 - Oh, no.\\
548 - We'd have to tell them the whole
story.\\
549 - We can't tell anyone about this.\\
550 - "...and so, it's been firmly
established\\
551 - "that most of the reports\\
552 - "were the result of mass hysteria.\\
553 - "The only Martians anyone saw\\
554 - "were two on top of the Empire State
Building,\\
555 - "and it is suspected\\
556 - "that they might have had something
to do\\
557 - "with the opening tomorrow of a
motion picture\\
558 - "entitled Women From Mars.\\
559 - "So everybody relax.\\
560 - There has been no invasion by
Martians."\\
561 - FRED: Mm-hmm.\\
562 - Well, I don't know.\\
563 - Well, why do you say that, honey?\\
564 - Well, I've just got a funny feeling.\\
565 - Listen, by the way, you haven't said
much about this.\\
566 - Where were you when all this
excitement happened?\\
567 - Oh, we-we-we were out shopping\\
568 - and we didn't hear anything about it\\
569 - until we got home, did we, Ethel?\\
570 - No, no, we didn't hear anything about
it.\\
571 - Oh.\\
572 - Well, dinner's ready.\\
573 - Yes, sir.
It looks good\\
574 - Fine. Looks good.\\
575 - I hope that meat\\
576 - is cooked the way you like it, Fred.\\
577 - It looks delicious, Lucy.
Looks delicious.\\
578 - I kind of like to do things\\
579 - the way you like them, you know.\\
580 - You're a good cook.\\
581 - You're the champion hostess.\\

\subsection {Episode 24: Lucy Writes a Novel}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Hi.\\
3 - Hi.\\
4 - What are you doing?\\
5 - Writing a novel.\\
6 - Oh. I brought back the magazine I...\\
7 - A novel?!\\
8 - Yeah. I found this in the paper this
morning.\\
9 - "Housewife wins $10,000 prize for
first novel."\\
10 - Need I say more?\\
11 - Yes.\\
12 - Well, I'm a housewife.\\
13 - Oh, well, I think it takes a little
more than that\\
14 - to write a novel.\\
15 - What are you going to write about?\\
16 - I'm writing about things I know.\\
17 - That won't be a novel, that'll be a
short story.\\
18 - One more remark like that\\
19 - and I'll kill you off in chapter one.\\
20 - Oh, am I going to be in it?\\
21 - Sure. We all are-- you, Ricky, Fred,
me--\\
22 - not under our own names, of course.\\
23 - Now then...\\
24 - (sighs)\\
25 - What are you doing?\\
26 - I'm studying you.\\
27 - Huh?\\
28 - Ethel, what makes you tick?\\
29 - Tick?\\
30 - What makes you you?\\
31 - Me me?\\
32 - Yeah.\\
33 - Lucy, I don't think I'm going to like
this.\\
34 - Ethel, you don't seem to realize what
this means.\\
35 - My novel may turn out to be another
Gone With The Wind.\\
36 - If it does, that makes you Scarlett
O'Hara.\\
37 - Me?!\\
38 - Yeah.\\
39 - Oh.\\
40 - Well, if you want to know what I'm
really like,\\
41 - I'm deeper than most people think.\\
42 - I'm sensitive.\\
43 - I feel things.\\
44 - What's the matter, Ethel?\\
45 - You got a stomachache?\\
46 - Well, if it isn't Rhett Butler.\\
47 - Why don't you find out what makes him
tick?\\
48 - He creaks a little, too.\\
49 - What's going on in this booby hatch?\\
50 - "Booby hatch"!\\
51 - That's good. I'll use it.\\
52 - Ethel, what is all this?\\
53 - Lucy's writing a novel, and we're all
gonna be in it!\\
54 - You mean she's writing a novel this
very minute?\\
55 - Yeah.
No kidding?\\
56 - Yeah.
Well, well...\\
57 - What's going on?\\
58 - Lucy's writing a novel.\\
59 - Oh.\\
60 - What?!\\
61 - She's writing a novel, and we're all
in it.\\
62 - Are you kidding?\\
63 - You're really writing a novel?\\
64 - Yes, and I'm glad you're up.\\
65 - There are a few questions I'd like to
put to you.\\
66 - All right... put.\\
67 - What was your reaction\\
68 - when you came to this country for the
first time?\\
69 - "A lonely immigrant\\
70 - arriving in New York Harbor on a
cattle boat."\\
71 - You crazy or something?\\
72 - You know darn well I came here by
plane--\\
73 - from Havana to Miami Beach-- and I
wasn't lonely;\\
74 - I had 14 musicians with me.\\
75 - Not in my book, you didn't.\\
76 - "As your leaky Cuban cattle boat
steamed into New York Harbor,\\
77 - "tears cascaded down your cheeks\\
78 - "as you saw the Statue of Liberty for
the first time.\\
79 - "You clutched your knapsack to you--\\
80 - "your pitiful little bundle\\
81 - "that contained all your worldly
belongings--\\
82 - "and you wept unashamedly.\\
83 - "You made a vow\\
84 - "that someday you would be a famous
orchestra leader.\\
85 - "You promised yourself\\
86 - Wait a minute.
Wait, wait!
"that never...\\
87 - Wait, wait!
Wait, wait!
never would you..."\\
88 - Wait, wait, wait.\\
89 - Is this the kind of stuff you're
writing about?\\
90 - Yeah. Pretty good, huh?\\
91 - But, honey, it isn't true.\\
92 - Ricky, that's what writers do.\\
93 - They take the truth and twist it a
little.\\
94 - Well, if your book doesn't sell,\\
95 - you can always get a job making
pretzels.\\
96 - I think we'd better take a look\\
97 - at what she's writing about.\\
98 - Yeah, I want to see how she's
twisting me.\\
99 - Yeah.
Just a moment.\\
100 - A writer's work is sacred.\\
101 - You can read it when it becomes a
best seller.\\
102 - And now, if you'll excuse me,\\
103 - the muse calls, and I must answer.\\
104 - Yep, it's not here.\\
105 - Well, I can't find it.\\
106 - ETHEL: It's not in here.\\
107 - Well, we looked all over this place
and the other room.\\
108 - Let's go and look in the kitchen.\\
109 - All right.
Okay.\\
110 - It's got to be here someplace.\\
111 - Fred, if you were Lucy's novel, where
would you go?\\
112 - Oh, I'd run down in the basement and
jump in the furnace.\\
113 - Aah, come on, this is silly.\\
114 - It's got to be here someplace.\\
115 - RICKY: Look under the sink, will you?\\
116 - Oh, okay.\\
117 - I'll give you some light.\\
118 - FRED: Yeah, that'll help.\\
119 - I got it!\\
120 - What?
What?\\
121 - She had it in the blind!\\
122 - She had it up there in the blind!\\
123 - Oh, my heavens.\\
124 - Oh, God, come on...\\
125 - In the blind.\\
126 - Oh, boy.\\
127 - How cute can you be?\\
128 - Now we'll get this all straightened
out here.\\
129 - Listen to this.\\
130 - I got the title.\\
131 - Real Gone With The Wind.\\
132 - Real gone.\\
133 - (guffawing)\\
134 - Don't you love that.\\
135 - Here's the first page.\\
136 - "Now it can be told for the first
time\\
137 - "how I, Lucille Mcgillicuddy,\\
138 - "gave up a brilliant career in the
theater\\
139 - "to marry a poor and unknown bongo
player...\\
140 - "This, then, will be the story\\
141 - "of one of the brightest lights in
show business\\
142 - and how she dimmed her bulb."\\
143 - Oh, brother!\\
144 - (guffawing)\\
145 - "Dimmed her bulb!"\\
146 - Wait a minute.\\
147 - Wait, I got something here.
Listen to this.\\
148 - "Later, we moved to an apartment on
East 68th Street.\\
149 - "It was there that I met Ethel Nurtz,
our landlady.\\
150 - Ethel Nurtz?\\
151 - That must be misspelled.\\
152 - No, she said she wasn't gonna use our
real names.\\
153 - Well, nobody'd know who Ethel Nurtz
is.\\
154 - Oh, no.
No.\\
155 - Let me go on here.
Get the rest of it.\\
156 - "It was there I met our landlady,
Ethel Nurtz.\\
157 - "We became the very best of friends\\
158 - "in spite of the great difference in
our ages.\\
159 - "As the years went along,\\
160 - "I came to think of her not just as a
friend,\\
161 - not just as a neighbor, but as a
mother."\\
162 - A mother?!\\
163 - It says so!\\
164 - (laughing uncontrollably)\\
165 - I don't think that's so funny.\\
166 - Oh, no, I think it's kind of good.\\
167 - Go ahead and laugh.\\
168 - (laughing)
(laughing)\\
169 - Well, ha-ha-ha, listen to this.\\
170 - "A colorful character in our
neighborhood\\
171 - was a funny old coot named Fred
Nurtz."\\
172 - Shall I go on?\\
173 - No.
Go on.\\
174 - "He was really a nice person if you
had the time and energy\\
175 - "to look beneath his rough and grumpy
exterior.\\
176 - "The best thing about Fred was that
when you met him,\\
177 - you understood why Ethel was like she
was."\\
178 - What does that mean?\\
179 - I don't know, but I'll bet it's
insulting.\\
180 - Yeah.\\
181 - Now, come on, don't be such bad
sports.\\
182 - You're being too sensitive.\\
183 - Oh, we're being sensitive.\\
184 - Sure.
Wait till you get to the part...\\
185 - Go on, find something about yourself.\\
186 - Yeah, let's get a page...\\
187 - We'll see how sensitive you are.\\
188 - Okay.
"Mother,"\\
189 - "difference in our ages."\\
190 - Whoo.	    Here's something.\\
191 - Here's something right here.\\
192 - "The greatest day of my life\\
193 - "was the day I was married to Nicky
Nicardo.\\
194 - Nick...
Nicky Nicardo?\\
195 - I wonder who she means.\\
196 - Oh, I wouldn't know.\\
197 - "Although Nicky was an unknown\\
198 - when I married him..."\\
199 - (clears throat)\\
200 - "...he soon became one of the
country's\\
201 - leading Latin-American entertainers."\\
202 - That doesn't make me mad.\\
203 - No, no.\\
204 - Shouldn't.\\
205 - "His voice charmed millions.\\
206 - His guitar-playing made women swoon."\\
207 - You know, she writes very well.\\
208 - "His voice charmed millions.\\
209 - "His guitar-playing made women swoon.\\
210 - So it was a small wonder that..."\\
211 - Where's page 12?\\
212 - Page 12.\\
213 - Let's find it.\\
214 - I got it.
I got it.\\
215 - Good.
What did that say?\\
216 - "His voice charmed millions.\\
217 - "His guitar-playing made women swoon.\\
218 - "So it was a small wonder that...\\
219 - "...he turned into such a big ham,\\
220 - you could stuff him with clove."\\
221 - (guffawing)\\
222 - Now, that is not funny.\\
223 - It's not funny at all. No, sir.\\
224 - I think we'd better read this novel\\
225 - from beginning to end right now.\\
226 - I want the whole thing, the whole
thing.\\
227 - I want to read the whole thing.\\
228 - Makes a nice fire, doesn't it?\\
229 - Uh-huh.\\
230 - Well, hi, everybody.\\
231 - RICKY: Hi.\\
232 - Hello.
Hello.\\
233 - How come you got a fire on a nice day
like this?\\
234 - Well, it makes it so comfy-like.\\
235 - There's nothing like a good book and
a roaring fire.\\
236 - (Ethel laughing)\\
237 - You mean a good book in a roaring
fire.\\
238 - That's more like it.\\
239 - Yeah.\\
240 - (chuckling)\\
241 - What are you three up to?\\
242 - We pulled down the kitchen blind\\
243 - and changed the name of your novel\\
244 - to Forever Ember.\\
245 - You didn't.\\
246 - Well, the three little snoopers.\\
247 - I trust you didn't have too much
trouble finding it.\\
248 - Well, it wasn't easy.\\
249 - First of all, we had to make
ourselves think the way you do.\\
250 - That was an accomplishment in itself.\\
251 - You know, the way that you wrote\\
252 - about the Mertzes and me is really
something.\\
253 - "A great difference in our ages."
Huh!\\
254 - "Funny old coot."\\
255 - "I'm such a ham, I should go lie down\\
256 - between two pieces of rye bread."\\
257 - My book isn't even published yet and
already I'm being misquoted.\\
258 - Thanks to us, your book will never be
published.\\
259 - But don't worry, it went out in a
blaze of glory.\\
260 - Yep, you wrote a red-hot novel.\\
261 - (chuckling): That's where I got...\\
262 - "A blaze of glory."\\
263 - "A red-hot novel."\\
264 - "A blaze of glory." That's...\\
265 - You're all very smug, aren't you?\\
266 - If I'd known the type of people that
I was dealing with,\\
267 - I'd have made a carbon copy.\\
268 - Yes, that would have been very
clever.\\
269 - Yes.		    Mm.\\
270 - As a matter of fact, I do know\\
271 - the type of people that I'm dealing
with.\\
272 - Pardon me.\\
273 - Pardon me, please. Pardon.\\
274 - Pardon me, please.\\
275 - Pardon.\\
276 - Pardon me.\\
277 - Pardon, please.\\
278 - Let's see.\\
279 - I think that's all.\\
280 - One, two, three-- yes.\\
281 - Not counting the one that I sent\\
282 - to Dorrance & Company Publishers.\\
283 - See you around the bookstores.\\
284 - Oh, darn it!\\
285 - (door slamming)\\
286 - Don't tell me you've been down there\\
287 - looking for that mailman again.\\
288 - Yes, I have.
You'd think\\
289 - he'd be early just this once\\
290 - when he knows that I'm waiting\\
291 - for a letter from my publisher.\\
292 - Lucy, you really don't think\\
293 - anyone's gonna publish that book of
yours, do you?\\
294 - You don't, do you?\\
295 - If I had the slightest idea\\
296 - that anyone would ever consider it,\\
297 - I'd be down at the publisher's with
my lawyer right now.\\
298 - You wait.\\
299 - You'll eat those words.\\
300 - If anybody ever publishes that book,
I'll eat my hat.\\
301 - (doorbell buzzing)
Oh...\\
302 - Registered letter.\\
303 - Dorrance & Dorrance Publishers!\\
304 - Will you sign here, please?\\
305 - Please.
Yeah. Oh.\\
306 - Thank you.
Thank you.\\
307 - It's here! It's here!\\
308 - This is it. I got it.\\
309 - They din't.\\
310 - Oh, "din't" they?\\
311 - They're gonna publish my book\\
312 - and they sent me a hundred- dollar
advance royalty!\\
313 - Be my guest.\\
314 - (crunching)\\
315 - (crunching)\\
316 - Darlings, wait till you hear!\\
317 - I had the most wonderful idea for a
sequel to my first novel.\\
318 - It's all about a little boy\\
319 - who runs away from a plantation in
Cuba.\\
320 - I'm calling it Sugarcane Mutiny.\\
321 - Sweet.\\
322 - Lucy?\\
323 - Yes, sir.\\
324 - We have something to say to you.\\
325 - Yes, darling?\\
326 - Fred and Ethel and I just had a
conference.\\
327 - Oh.\\
328 - Nothing personal, dear,\\
329 - but we're suing you for libel.\\
330 - You're suing me?!\\
331 - For every cent I've got.\\
332 - Well, I can't believe it.\\
333 - You're suing me-- your wife, your
best friend?\\
334 - Yup. We three are suing\\
335 - little old loveable, libelous Lucy.\\
336 - Well, if that's the way you feel
about it.\\
337 - Too bad, though, considering\\
338 - I was going to split the royalties
four ways.\\
339 - FRED: Split the royalties?!\\
340 - Yes, yes. I was saving that as sort
of a surprise.\\
341 - Lucy, you know darn well that that
never occurred to you\\
342 - until you found out that we were
going to sue.\\
343 - Well, that was a surprise.\\
344 - ETHEL: I still say sue her.\\
345 - Sue her!\\
346 - Oh, sewer, sewer!\\
347 - Get your mind out of the gutter!\\
348 - I don't want my name in that book.\\
349 - Ethel, just think of the money.\\
350 - Why, your share alone might be
$50,000.\\
351 - Yeah, what's the matter with you,
Ethel?\\
352 - It sounds all right to me.\\
353 - Why, Fred, where's your pride?\\
354 - Remember, she called you an old coot.\\
355 - Listen, she can call me anything she
likes for $50,000\\
356 - Honestly!\\
357 - I'm in for a fourth, Lucy.\\
358 - Well, this friend, neighbor and
mother is not.\\
359 - Neither is the Cuban ham.\\
360 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
361 - Well!\\
362 - Yes?\\
363 - Mrs. Ricardo?
Yes, sir?\\
364 - I'm Mr. Dorrance of Dorrance &
Company.\\
365 - Oh! How do you do, Mr. Dorrance?\\
366 - Oh, I'm so happy to see you.\\
367 - Oh, this is Mr. Dorrance, my
publisher.\\
368 - How do you do?
Mr. and Mrs. Mertz.\\
369 - How are you?
And this is my husband,\\
370 - Mr. Ricardo.
How do you do?\\
371 - Mr. Dorrance, my publisher.\\
372 - Won't you sit down, sir?\\
373 - Thank you.
Oh, excuse me.\\
374 - Oh, Mr. Dorrance, this is such a
surprise.\\
375 - I'm so pleased to meet you.\\
376 - It certainly is a wonderful thrill\\
377 - to have my book published for the
first time.\\
378 - Well, Mrs. Ricardo,\\
379 - ordinarily, I don't handle these
things myself.\\
380 - But in your case, I thought I ought
to come out\\
381 - and talk to you myself.\\
382 - Oh, really?\\
383 - Yes. Mrs. Ricardo,\\
384 - last week my secretary got married.\\
385 - Oh. Well, congratulations.\\
386 - Thank you.\\
387 - Anyway, for the last few days,\\
388 - she hasn't had her mind on her work,\\
389 - and somehow, she got your name\\
390 - on someone else's manuscript.\\
391 - You mean...
she made a mistake?\\
392 - That's right.\\
393 - And when I wrote to you,\\
394 - asking to publish your novel,\\
395 - I was referring to someone else's
work entirely.\\
396 - Oh.\\
397 - I was just sick when I found out
about it,\\
398 - so I sat down and read your novel.\\
399 - I know how disheartening this is\\
400 - to someone who is just starting to
write,\\
401 - and I can't tell you how sorry I am
that it happened.\\
402 - Oh, well, then this means you won't
be publishing...?\\
403 - I'm sorry,\\
404 - but it isn't quite\\
405 - what we're looking for right now.\\
406 - Oh.\\
407 - Well, I-I guess you want your check
back, then.\\
408 - No, please. We'd like you\\
409 - to keep it for all of the heartaches
we've given you.\\
410 - Oh, no.
No, I couldn't accept it.\\
411 - I wish you would.\\
412 - Oh, no. I couldn't.\\
413 - Well, I could accept $25 of it.\\
414 - Well, good-bye.\\
415 - Uh... thank you for coming over, Mr.
Dorrance.\\
416 - I'm awfully sorry.
It's all right.\\
417 - Good-bye.
Thank you.\\
418 - Oh, honey, don't feel so bad.\\
419 - What does he know?\\
420 - Oh, sure.\\
421 - You wrote a wonderful novel full of
true-to-life characters.\\
422 - RICKY: Yeah.\\
423 - Yeah, come to think of it,\\
424 - I really am a funny old coot.\\
425 - Sure he is.\\
426 - Sure. Sure.\\
427 - Come on, honey, cry or something.\\
428 - Don't just stand there looking like
that.\\
429 - I can't take it.\\
430 - I can't cry.\\
431 - This is deeper than tears.\\
432 - Oh, now, wait till you write your
second novel.\\
433 - Why, Mr. Dorrance will come crawling
to buy it.\\
434 - Yeah!
FRED: Sure, yeah, sure.\\
435 - There'll be no second novel.\\
436 - My voice has been stilled.\\
437 - Aw, honey, don't cry.\\
438 - Well, make up your mind.\\
439 - You want me to cry or don't you?\\
440 - I mean, it's nothing to get so upset
and sad about.\\
441 - I'm not sad for myself.\\
442 - I'm sad for the world.\\
443 - Mankind will never benefit from these
immortal pages.\\
444 - It isn't my loss, it's a loss to
civilization.\\
445 - Too bad, world.\\
446 - Too bad, mankind.\\
447 - Sorry, book of the month.\\
448 - You had your chance, Bennett Cerf!\\
449 - You'll get no more books from me,\\
450 - so go watch television!\\
451 - Ricky, will you write a note to the
milkman for me?\\
452 - Sure. Why don't you do it?\\
453 - Please, I'm not writing anything
again as long as I live.\\
454 - What do you want me to say?\\
455 - Two quarts of milk and a pint of
cream.\\
456 - Okay.
(phone ringing)\\
457 - Hello.\\
458 - Oh, hello, Mr. Dorrance.\\
459 - You did?\\
460 - You do?\\
461 - Oh, yes, sir.
First thing in the morning.\\
462 - Yes, sir. Yes, sir.\\
463 - Mr. Mel Eaton. E-a-t-o-n.\\
464 - Yes, sir.\\
465 - Plaza 5-2-0-9-9.\\
466 - Oh, yes. Yes, sir, I will.\\
467 - First thing in the morning.\\
468 - Oh, and thank you, sir.\\
469 - Good-bye.\\
470 - Ricky, that was Mr. Dorrance, my
publisher,\\
471 - and he talked to a friend of his
who's a publisher\\
472 - and he told this friend about my book\\
473 - and he wants to see it.\\
474 - He thinks he can use it.\\
475 - Oh, honey, that's wonderful.\\
476 - Isn't it great?\\
477 - Wait a minute.
You tor...
What's the matter?\\
478 - You tore up every copy you had.\\
479 - Oh, well, we'll have to glue one\\
480 - back together again.
Where is it?\\
481 - I just took the trash down to the
basement.\\
482 - Oh, Ricky, no!\\
483 - I didn't know that...
Hey, you want to go to...\\
484 - What time does Fred burn the trash?\\
485 - Uh, uh, he's burning it right now.\\
486 - No! No, Fred!\\
487 - What's the matter?\\
488 - Fred, hold everything!\\
489 - Fred!
Hold everything!\\
490 - Fred, hold everything!\\
491 - What's the matter?\\
492 - Have you burned the trash yet?\\
493 - I just started.\\
494 - Which one did you put it in, Ricky?\\
495 - I-I put it in one of these.\\
496 - Well, which one?!\\
497 - I don't know. They all look the same
to me.\\
498 - Don't just stand there, start
looking!\\
499 - Okay.\\
500 - Wait a minute, wait a minute, will
you?\\
501 - What the Sam Hill's going on here?\\
502 - Another publisher wants to publish
Lucy's novel,\\
503 - and it's all in the trash, all
torn-up pieces.\\
504 - Oh, this is the silliest thing I ever
heard of.\\
505 - Pawing through trash from all the
apartments\\
506 - trying to find two or three bits of
paper!\\
507 - 25% of it is yours!\\
508 - Well, don't just stand there, start
looking!\\
509 - Come on!\\
510 - Want to try that there, huh?\\
511 - RICKY: No, that's not it. No.\\
512 - Oh, that fits there.\\
513 - This goes right there.\\
514 - Another one from here?\\
515 - These must go over on the other side.\\
516 - Take a look over there, will you?\\
517 - Let's try it.\\
518 - (Ricky grunts)\\
519 - "Poor thing."\\
520 - Well, that's 32.\\
521 - I'm ready for 33.\\
522 - I've got it here-- everything but one
little piece.\\
523 - Ethel.
Huh?\\
524 - See if you can find one that fits
this, will you?\\
525 - What's it supposed to say?\\
526 - Oh, right here. I got...\\
527 - So far, I got "I thought about it at
night\\
528 - "before going to bed, as I sat there,
brushing my..."\\
529 - What follows, Lucy?\\
530 - Naturally red hair.\\
531 - "Naturally red hair"?\\
532 - Why, I threw that away.\\
533 - I didn't think that came from Lucy's
book.\\
534 - Oh, come on, get it out of there\\
535 - and bring it over here.\\
536 - I'll try and find it.
I think I can find it.\\
537 - Here it is!\\
538 - ETHEL: He's got it.\\
539 - Oh, good.\\
540 - (stifling sneeze)\\
541 - LUCY: Ricky, don't sneeze!\\
542 - ETHEL: Oh, no! Oh, no, Ricky.\\
543 - Ricky, don't sneeze!\\
544 - Don't sneeze!
No, no!\\
545 - Honey, don't sneeze.\\
546 - Whatever you do, don't sneeze.\\
547 - Okay.\\
548 - (stifling sneeze)\\
549 - Oh, hang on.\\
550 - Take it easy, kid.\\
551 - Hang on.
Take it easy.\\
552 - Ah, that's my boy.\\
553 - I knew you could do it.\\
554 - Okay, I got that page for you, honey.\\
555 - You're the wonderful...\\
556 - Look out, honey!\\
557 - (loud sneeze)\\
558 - Oh, honey!\\
559 - Lucy!\\
560 - I'm sorry, Mr. Eaton,\\
561 - but a $10,000 advance will not be
sufficient.\\
562 - Huh?\\
563 - Oh, Mr. Eaton.\\
564 - Why do you have on your pajamas?\\
565 - Honey, it's me, Ricky.\\
566 - Wake up.\\
567 - Oh. Oh.\\
568 - Haven't you gone to bed yet?\\
569 - No. I have to retype this so it'll be
neat.\\
570 - (typing)\\
571 - Honey, it's 9:30 in the morning!\\
572 - You said you were coming right to
bed.\\
573 - Come on, honey.
You got to get some rest.\\
574 - Come on, sweetheart, honey.\\
575 - What's the matter?\\
576 - She's supposed to see Mr.
Eaton early this morning.\\
577 - Well, she wanted to...\\
578 - Yeah, I got to call Mr. Eaton.\\
579 - I have to call Mr. Eaton right now.\\
580 - ETHEL: What happened to her?\\
581 - RICKY: Well, she wanted to retype the
novel so it'd look neat,\\
582 - and she sat up all night\\
583 - and typed the whole thing over again.\\
584 - Oh, no.\\
585 - RICKY: She hasn't gone to bed yet.\\
586 - (phone ringing)\\
587 - Hello.\\
588 - Oh, may I speak to Mr. Eaton, please?\\
589 - This is Mr. Eaton speaking.\\
590 - Oh, Mr. Eaton, This is Mrs. Ricardo.\\

595 - Come down any time you like.\\
596 - Oh, thank you, sir.\\
597 - Oh, uh, Mrs. Ricardo...\\
598 - Yes, sir?\\
599 - Did Mr. Dorrance tell you how I
wanted to use it?\\
600 - How's that?\\
601 - Mr. Dorrance, did he tell you how I
wanted to use it?\\
602 - No, sir.\\
603 - Well, I'd like very much\\
604 - to print portions of it in a textbook\\
605 - I'm preparing on how to write a
novel.\\
606 - Oh!\\
607 - Oh, he wants to print portions of it\\
608 - in a textbook on how to write a
novel.\\
609 - Go on, Mr. Eaton.\\
610 - Well, I-I wish Mr. Dorrance had
mentioned this to you,\\
611 - but, uh... it'll head up the chapter
entitled\\
612 - "Don't let this happen to you."\\
613 - Uh, it's going to head up the chapter
entitled\\
614 - "Don't let this happen to you."\\

\subsection {Episode 25: Lucy's Club Dance}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
3 - (women chattering)\\
4 - Girls... girls...\\
5 - (pounding gavel)\\
6 - Girls, come on.\\
7 - Girls, let's get on with the meeting.\\
8 - But, Madam President, Marion hasn't
finished\\
9 - her story about Jim and Dorothy Winn.\\
10 - It is not our concern if Jim and
Dorothy Winn\\
11 - had a knock-down, drag-out fight.\\
12 - This is the Wednesday Afternoon Fine
Arts League.\\
13 - We do not meet to gossip.\\
14 - Since when?\\
15 - Girls, girls.\\
16 - Oh, yes.\\
17 - Is there any unfinished business?\\
18 - The chair recognizes Lucy Ricardo.\\
19 - Marion, did Jim really give Dorothy a
black eye?\\
20 - Oh, Lucy.\\
21 - Lucy.\\
22 - Well, that was unfinished business.\\
23 - Oh, sit down.\\
24 - Well, if there's no more unfinished
business,\\
25 - I have an important announcement to
make.\\
26 - We only have $1.14 in the treasury,\\
27 - so I hereby declare\\
28 - the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts
League\\
29 - in a state of emergency.\\
30 - You can say that again.\\
31 - We have to get some money in the
treasury\\
32 - and we have to get it there fast.\\
33 - The chair entertains ideas on just
how to do this.\\
34 - The chair recognizes Caroline
Appleby.\\
35 - Well, there's one thing we've never
done\\
36 - and it usually works pretty good.\\
37 - What's that?\\
38 - How about giving a dance?\\
39 - A dance!\\
40 - That's a wonderful idea.\\
41 - Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!\\
42 - his lodge hall for nothing.\\
43 - And we can decorate it ourselves\\
44 - and we can all pitch in and make
punch.\\
45 - And we can charge five dollars a
couple\\
46 - and make a fortune.\\
47 - Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.\\
48 - We have forgotten one very important
item.\\
49 - Well, I don't know what.\\
50 - We got the hall, we got the
refreshments,\\
51 - we got the decorations.\\
52 - What else do you need for a dance?\\
53 - An orchestra.\\
54 - Oh, gee, you couldn't get much of an
orchestra\\
55 - for $1.14, could you?\\
56 - Maybe we could buy ten kazoos and
play them ourselves.\\
57 - Oh, that was a good idea.\\
58 - What a shame.\\
59 - Hey! Wait a minute.\\
60 - We forgot about me.\\
61 - I'm married to an orchestra.\\
62 - Oh, but, Lucy, Ricky wouldn't play
for us\\
63 - for nothing, would he?\\
64 - Of course he would.
All I'd have to do is ask him.\\
65 - And you know what he'd say?\\
66 - Yeah, and I don't want to hear it.\\
67 - Now, Ethel, you know he'd love to do
it.\\
68 - And listen, if we get them\\
69 - we can use a Latin- American theme.\\
70 - Ooh, we can call it "A Night in
Havana."\\
71 - With those hats and cucarachas...\\
72 - Oh, wait, wait, wait.\\
73 - Shh.\\
74 - Hello, dear.\\
75 - Hi. Yeah, the meeting's going on
right now, dear.\\
76 - That's what I called you about.\\
77 - Listen, the girls are going to give a
big benefit dance.\\
78 - Well, the benefit is for us.\\
79 - Yeah. Yeah, well, so I told the girls
that you'd be glad\\
80 - to play for us for nothing.\\
81 - (Ricky yelling in Spanish)\\
82 - Yeah, well, good-bye, dear.\\
83 - Where do we go to get the kazoos?\\
84 - Well, that was a nice idea.\\
85 - Now what will we do to raise money?\\
86 - Gosh, I didn't think he'd do it,
though.\\
87 - Wait a minute.\\
88 - Why can't we form our own orchestra?\\
89 - Ethel, you play the piano, don't you?\\
90 - A little.\\
91 - I can fool around on the drums.\\
92 - And Neeva Summer plays the violin.\\
93 - And Marie Deemo plays the trumpet.\\
94 - Well, we all play something, so why
not?\\
95 - Oh, do you really think we could form
our own orchestra?\\
96 - Sure, we could.\\
97 - We're in great shape.\\
98 - Uh, nobody mentioned it, but I just
take for granted\\
99 - that you want me to be star soloist
on my saxophone.\\
100 - Well, the orchestra idea's out.\\
101 - Any other ideas Now, Ethel.\\
102 - on how to raise some money?\\
103 - Listen, you haven't even heard them
play\\
104 - and you want them in the orchestra.\\
105 - Why don't you want me?\\
106 - I've heard you play.\\
107 - Well, thanks.\\
108 - I've never heard her.
How does she play, Ethel?\\
109 - When Lucy plays the saxophone,\\
110 - it sounds like a moose with a head
cold.\\
111 - I heard her play "Glow Worm" once\\
112 - and no way...\\
113 - Now, listen, just for that I wouldn't
be in your orchestra\\
114 - if you begged me.\\
115 - Ah, you really mean that, Lucy?\\
116 - Yes, I do.\\
117 - Good. Now, if you'll get all your
instruments\\
118 - and come up to my apartment...\\
119 - (all talking)\\
120 - (piano playing slow scales)\\
121 - (stumbling over keys)\\
122 - (hitting off-key notes)\\
123 - Hi, Rick.\\
124 - Hi, Fred.\\
125 - Here's the light bulb\\
126 - you wanted for your bathroom.\\
127 - I was wondering how you stood\\
128 - Ethel's piano playing.\\
129 - I said, I was wondering\\
130 - how you stood Ethel's piano playing!\\
131 - Yeah, ain't that awful?\\
132 - She's been going at it since 8:00
this morning.\\
133 - You know, I may have to soundproof\\
134 - this whole darn building.\\
135 - That orchestra they're forming\\
136 - is liable to set music back 50 years.\\
137 - (piano playing stops)\\
138 - Well, she stopped.\\
139 - She stopped.\\
140 - Good. Maybe the piano lid fell on her
fingers.\\
141 - Boy, you ought to be glad Lucy's not
practicing\\
142 - on that saxophone of hers.\\
143 - Yeah, and I don't get it.\\
144 - But I'd be a fool to ask.\\
145 - Yeah, well, I can tell you why.\\
146 - The other girls don't want her in the
band.\\
147 - Oh, that's it, huh?\\
148 - Yeah.\\
149 - Oh, hi, Fred.\\
150 - Hi, Lucy.\\
151 - I heard your wife practicing on the
piano.\\
152 - Yeah, you and everybody else in the
neighborhood.\\
153 - I hope it didn't bother you.\\
154 - Oh, no, it didn't bother me a bit. I
like it.\\
155 - You're bighearted considering\\
156 - Ethel helped kick you out of the
band.\\
157 - Well, yes, I am bighearted.\\
158 - I even lent her our piano.\\
159 - Besides, I'm back in the band.\\
160 - Oh, Ethel didn't tell me that.\\
161 - She doesn't know yet.\\
162 - What do you mean, Lucy?\\
163 - Well, I have a plan,\\
164 - and all I need is the help\\
165 - of my dear, sweet, orchestra-leader
husband.\\
166 - I knew I should not ask.\\
167 - Now, Ricky, listen to me.\\
168 - Hey, you should have told me\\
169 - about these before.\\
170 - They work great.\\
171 - I can't hear a word she's saying.\\
172 - Now, Ricky, you stop that.\\
173 - Now, Lucy...\\
174 - Now, the least you can do\\
175 - is listen to my plan.\\
176 - Oh, well, I guess I might as well
listen\\
177 - to whatever it is I'm not going to
do.\\
178 - Look, all you have to do\\
179 - is rehearse our orchestra\\
180 - for one or two twiddly little hours.\\
181 - Nothing doing.
Not me.\\
182 - But, honey, you just have to.\\
183 - I can make a deal with them.\\
184 - They get to work with a famous
conductor\\
185 - and I get to be in the band.\\
186 - Well, you just deal me out of your
deal.\\
187 - Oh, now, Ricky, please.\\
188 - Nothing doing.\\
189 - Honey, now I'm not asking very
much...\\
190 - What do you mean?\\
191 - I'd spend two hours with a bunch of
women...\\
192 - Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.\\
193 - (whistles)\\
194 - Hold it. Hold it, will you?
Hold it!\\
195 - Now, listen, kids.\\
196 - I've known both of you for 13 years\\
197 - and I've seen and listened to a lot
of discussions.\\
198 - So?\\
199 - Now you're going to harangue about
this, aren't you, Lucy?\\
200 - Yes, I am.\\
201 - And you're going to nag him.\\
202 - Well, yes.\\
203 - And if that don't work, you're going
to wheedle.\\
204 - Probably.\\
205 - You might even cry.\\
206 - If all else fails.\\
207 - And eventually, Ricky, you're going
to give in.\\
208 - Oh, I don't know.\\
209 - Not necessarily.\\
210 - Oh, you always do.\\
211 - Now why don't you save\\
212 - the wear and tear on your nerves,\\
213 - to say nothing of my nerves.\\
214 - Why don't you do what she wants?\\
215 - Yeah.\\
216 - You know something?\\
217 - I think you're right.\\
218 - Good.\\
219 - Thanks, Fred, for saving me so much
trouble.\\
220 - That's all right.\\
221 - Honey, you can rehearse us tomorrow
afternoon.\\
222 - I'll go practice on my saxophone.\\
223 - Saxophone...\\
224 - Give me those!\\
225 - Now come on, Fred, you had them all
day.\\
226 - Get your own set.\\
227 - (saxophone wailing off-key)\\
228 - (tuning up)\\
229 - That's it.\\
230 - (playing note repeatedly)
(playing off-key notes)\\
231 - That's it, that's it.
Jane?\\
232 - (playing note repeatedly)
(playing off-key notes)\\
233 - (playing same pitch as piano)\\
234 - Ah, I knew you had one there
someplace.\\
235 - Now... now, we're all tuned up.\\
236 - Let's start.\\
237 - One...\\
238 - two...\\
239 - (playing slowly and off-key)\\
240 - (continues playing slowly and
off-key)\\
241 - ETHEL: Wait a minute.\\
242 - Wait a minute.\\
243 - (music stops)\\
244 - "Twelfth Street Rag" never sounded
like that before.\\
245 - Oh, is that what it was?\\
246 - Oh, hi, Lucy.
Hi, Lucy.\\
247 - Well, if it isn't Ethel Mertz\\
248 - and her makes-you-want-to-stick-
your-fingers-in-your-ears music.\\
249 - Oh, come on, now, no use being sore\\
250 - just 'cause we won't let you play
with the orchestra.\\
251 - Yeah, it's just sour grapes.\\
252 - Listen, grapes aren't the only thing
that's sour around here.\\
253 - (all talking over each other)\\
254 - You know what you need, don't you?\\
255 - What?\\
256 - You need a professional orchestra
leader to help you.\\
257 - And out of the goodness of my heart,\\
258 - I have arranged for Ricky to come
over here and help you out.\\
259 - Really, Lucy?\\
260 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
261 - I'll go and get him right now.\\
262 - Oh!\\
263 - MARION: Oh!\\
264 - Oh, boy!\\
265 - Now I know the newspapers will give
us a lot of space.\\
266 - Look out for a trick.\\
267 - Oh, Ethel Mertz, I'm surprised at
you.\\
268 - I think it's very nice of Lucy to get
Ricky\\
269 - to come down here and help us,\\
270 - especially when we're not going to
let her be in our orchestra.\\
271 - Listen, I know that redhead,\\
272 - and I still say look out for a trick.\\
273 - Oh, this will make a wonderful
publicity spread.\\
274 - Listen, I'm going to run down\\
275 - and tell the paper.
See you all later!\\
276 - ALL: Bye, Marion.\\
277 - Maybe we'd better start this again.\\
278 - Yeah.\\
279 - I think with a little more
practice...\\
280 - (loud, off-key saxophone playing)\\
281 - (playing loudly and off-key)\\
282 - Where will I sit?\\
283 - I told you to look out for a trick.\\
284 - To get Ricky, we have to take her.\\
285 - Now, listen, Ethel,\\
286 - from the way this group sounded a
minute ago,\\
287 - one more bum note isn't gonna hurt
it.\\
288 - You know, she's got a point there.\\
289 - Well, okay.\\
290 - Where will I sit?\\
291 - Anywhere at all.\\
292 - Give me my music.\\
293 - I'm looking for it.\\
294 - I didn't know we were going to have a
saxophone.\\
295 - Oh.\\
296 - ETHEL: Try to get that just the
way...\\
297 - Hi, girls.\\
298 - Oh, hi, dear.\\
299 - I think you know the girls, don't
you?\\
300 - Remember Marie, Yeah, sure.\\
301 - Jane Beebo?
Hello.\\
302 - How are you?
Hi, Ricky.\\
303 - Oh, Ricky, it's so nice of you to
come down\\
304 - and help us like this.\\
305 - Yeah, well, yeah, I like to help the
women's clubs\\
306 - as much as I can, you know.\\
307 - Oh.\\
308 - (chuckling politely)\\
309 - Uh, what are you rehearsing?\\
310 - "Twelfth Street Rag."\\
311 - Oh, "Twelfth Street Rag." Uh-huh.\\
312 - Well, that's a nice, bright tune.\\
313 - Shall we take it Yeah.	     from the
top?\\
314 - ALL: Yeah!\\
315 - Okay, I'll give you the tempo, huh?\\
316 - All right.
It's right about...\\
317 - Right in here, see?\\
318 - All right, okay.
Right about this tempo.\\
319 - Okay? Here we go.\\
320 - One, two...\\
321 - (playing slowly and discordantly)\\
322 - Girls, girls, girls.\\
323 - (saxophone playing raucously)\\
324 - Girls!\\
325 - RICKY: Please.
What's the matter?\\
326 - This is supposed to be bright and
with a bounce.\\
327 - That's right.\\
328 - It sounds more like a funeral\\
329 - coming down 12th Street.\\
330 - Oh, now, Ricky...
Aw...\\
331 - Look, this is the way it's supposed
to go.\\
332 - (fingers snapping)
Right in here, see?\\
333 - ALL: Oh!\\
334 - We can do that.
Sure.\\
335 - Okay?\\
336 - Uh-huh.
Sure.\\
337 - All right, I'll give you two.
Uh-huh.\\
338 - (fingers snapping)
One, two...\\
339 - (playing slowly and discordantly)\\
340 - (continue playing slowly and
discordantly)\\
341 - Wait, wait, wait,\\
342 - wait, wait, wait.
(hitting sour note)\\
343 - Wait...\\
344 - Lucy, I think you were playing the
wrong note.\\
345 - I am?\\
346 - Well, it's kind of hard to tell, but
I think it was you, yeah.\\
347 - Now, can we all take, uh...\\
348 - Let's see, the-the first note in the
third bar.\\
349 - ETHEL:			Huh?
Okay.\\
350 - At the same time.
Now, wait a minute.\\
351 - Are you ready?\\
352 - Everybody together.\\
353 - Here we go.\\
354 - (Lucy hitting wrong note)\\
355 - See, it wasn't me.\\
356 - Lucy...\\
357 - What?\\
358 - Are you playing an F sharp?\\
359 - Well, I'm not sure.\\
360 - What do you mean, you're not sure?\\
361 - Well, are you talking about the fat,
little, white note\\
362 - or the black one with the wiggly
tail?\\
363 - The black one with the wiggly tail.\\
364 - Oh.\\
365 - Well, what about it?\\
366 - Is it an F or an F sharp?\\
367 - Oh.\\
368 - How can you tell?\\
369 - If it's an F sharp, it has a little
sign by it.\\
370 - Oh, you mean the lopsided
tic-tac-toe?\\
371 - Ay, que barbaridad...
lopsided tic-tac-toe.\\
372 - Yeah, that's an F sharp.\\
373 - Oh, well, live and learn.\\
374 - I'm sorry.
I'll do it right next time.\\
375 - "F" sharp, oh.\\
376 - All right, now, let's take it all
together, huh?\\
377 - Try to get this.\\
378 - I tell you what, look, look.\\
379 - I got an idea.\\
380 - You take the first bar on the piano,
Ethel.\\
381 - All right.
And then you come in\\
382 - the second bar on the violin.\\
383 - Lucy, you come in the third bar\\
384 - and then you finish it, Carolyn, all
right?\\
385 - Yeah.
Sort of an arrangement.\\
386 - Yeah, yeah.\\
387 - Here we go.\\
388 - One, two...\\
389 - (piano playing very slowly)\\
390 - (trombone plays an off-key note)\\
391 - (playing very slowly)\\
392 - (plays one off-key note)\\
393 - (playing slowly and off-key)\\
394 - (cymbal crashing)\\
395 - Ah, we did it!\\
396 - (all chattering excitedly)\\
397 - Girls, please!\\
398 - Girls, please, don't stop!\\
399 - But we were so good.\\
400 - Yeah, I know, you were wonderful,\\
401 - but let's, uh, let's try to do the
whole number once,\\
402 - you know, all the way to the end,\\
403 - Yeah.		just once,\\
404 - even if it kills us...\\
405 - and it probably will.\\
406 - Let's go...
from the top, everybody.\\
407 - One, two...\\
408 - (piano, saxophone and trombone
playing extremely slowly)\\
409 - (plays one off-key note)\\
410 - (playing slowly)\\
411 - (plays one off-key note)\\
412 - (playing slowly and raucously)\\
413 - Hey!\\
414 - Oh!\\

417 - (music)\\
418 - Yeah!\\
419 - (music)\\
420 - (music)\\
421 - (song ends)\\
422 - Oh!\\
423 - Oh, wonderful!\\
424 - Now, girls, you heard that--\\
425 - my boys-- the way that my boys
played.\\
426 - Yeah.
Yeah.\\
427 - Now, that's the way that it's
supposed to sound.\\
428 - Okay.
Oh, sure!\\
429 - You think you got it now?\\
430 - ETHEL: Oh, sure!\\
431 - Okay, let them try once, huh?\\
432 - ETHEL: Okay.\\
433 - Okay.
All right, girls.\\
434 - You go back and you try it again.\\
435 - ETHEL: Oh, that was good.\\
436 - Oh, boy.\\
437 - ETHEL: Oh, it makes you want to play
it right, doesn't it?\\
438 - (women chattering)
Okay.\\
439 - Oh, boy.\\
440 - All right.\\
441 - Now, let me hear it just that way,
now.\\
442 - ETHEL: Yes, sir.\\
443 - Okay, I'll give you two.\\
444 - One, two...\\
445 - (playing slowly and off-key)\\
446 - (humming "Twelfth Street Rag")\\
447 - Choo!\\
448 - Lucy...\\
449 - Yeah... oh.\\
450 - Honey, I forgot.\\
451 - I promise, I will never hum, whistle,
sing or reproduce\\
452 - in any manner "Twelfth Street Rag"\\
453 - in your presence as long as I live.\\
454 - Good.\\
455 - (telephone ringing)\\
456 - Hello.\\
457 - Lucy? Thank goodness, you're still
alive.\\
458 - What?\\
459 - Has Ricky read the morning paper yet?\\
460 - Yeah. Why?\\
461 - Has he seen the last page?\\
462 - No. Why?\\
463 - Don't let him. Grab it.\\
464 - Kick it out of his hand or something.\\
465 - What's the matter?\\
466 - There's a big picture of Ricky\\
467 - on the last page\\
468 - and an article, from which I quote,\\
469 - "Ricky Ricardo, well-known
entertainer\\
470 - "has formed a brand-new, all-girl
orchestra\\
471 - and will have its world premiere..."\\
472 - Oh, no.\\
473 - What's the matter?\\
474 - What's the matter?\\
475 - What's the matter?
What's the mat...\\
476 - Oh, yeah, I'll tell you what's the
matter.\\
477 - Well?\\
478 - Uh... I know.\\
479 - Um, Ethel just told me about a-a sale
on a dress\\
480 - that I paid full price for yesterday
downtown.\\
481 - Let me see the paper.\\
482 - Wait a minute.
I'm reading about the fights.\\
483 - Uh...\\
484 - "Continued on the back page."\\
485 - Uh, I can't wait!\\
486 - This is just terrible.\\
487 - They can't do a thing like that to
me.\\
488 - I don't have enough money to spend\\
489 - and they made me pay full prize for
it!\\
490 - (Lucy grumbling)\\
491 - Lucy!\\
492 - Yeah?\\
493 - You bring that paper back here right
now.\\
494 - Okay.\\
495 - It wasn't the same dress after all.\\
496 - Lucy!\\
497 - Yes, sir?\\
498 - Oh, you got your picture in the
paper.\\
499 - It isn't a very good likeness.\\
500 - Lucy...\\
501 - Yes, sir?\\
502 - Somebody opened a hole in this paper.\\
503 - Why, so they did.\\
504 - Did you do it?\\
505 - Oh, honey, you know, I wouldn't open
a hole in your paper\\
506 - when I know you haven't even read it.\\
507 - Well, if you didn't do it, and I
didn't do it\\
508 - who dood it?\\
509 - Maybe it was a mouse.\\
510 - A redheaded mouse?\\
511 - Well...\\
512 - Hey, Rick.\\
513 - Yeah, Fred?\\
514 - I was reading about the fights\\
515 - in this paper of mine\\
516 - and I find that half the back page is
cut out.\\
517 - Let me have a look at yours, will
you?\\
518 - Yours, too?\\
519 - Well, what do you make of this?\\
520 - That mouse sure gets around, doesn't
he?\\
521 - I don't know about the mouse,\\
522 - but I can sure smell a rat.\\
523 - Fred, would you like to get your coat\\
524 - and take a stroll down to the corner
newsstand with me?\\
525 - I will.\\
526 - We'll find out what's cooking around
here.\\
527 - Ethel, come over and take care of
little Ricky right away.\\
528 - It's an emergency.\\
529 - Hey!\\
530 - Well, I spoke to Ethel about that
paper\\
531 - before I went in to see you, but she
just played dumb...\\
532 - which wasn't too hard for her to do.\\
533 - Well, we'll find out now what's going
on.\\
534 - What is this?\\
535 - I don't know.\\
536 - They're all the same.\\
537 - You don't suppose it's some kind of
an ad, do you?\\
538 - No.\\
539 - Look, I want to find out what was...\\
540 - what's been cut out of this paper.\\
541 - I'll tell you what, let's go down
next block.\\
542 - There's another newsstand down there.\\
543 - All right.\\
544 - Oh, I think that's the afternoon
edition.\\
545 - Paper! Paper!\\
546 - Get your morning paper!\\
547 - Get your morning paper!\\
548 - Read all about it!\\
549 - The morning paper...\\
550 - (Ricky yelling in Spanish)\\
551 - (yelling in Spanish)\\
552 - (yelling in Spanish)\\
553 - Oh, now, Ricky, calm down.\\
554 - Calm down? Have you read this thing?\\
555 - Oh, yeah, but it wasn't Lucy's fault.\\
556 - Marion Strong put that in the paper.\\
557 - It was Lucy's fault for getting me
involved in this thing\\
558 - at the very beginning\\
559 - Well, I won't do it.\\
560 - Oh, Marion called up\\
561 - and said they'd sold hundreds of
tickets\\
562 - ever since that article appeared.\\
563 - Well, I don't care.\\
564 - I am not going to be publicly
responsible\\
565 - for your sour sextet.\\
566 - (telephone ringing)\\
567 - Hello.\\
568 - Yeah.\\
569 - What?!\\
570 - (slamming down phone)\\
571 - Good news, dear?\\
572 - That was my agent.\\
573 - LUCY: Oh?\\
574 - Yes. And he read the paper.\\
575 - Yeah.\\
576 - In the paper, he read that I was
going to appear\\
577 - with an all-girl orchestra,\\
578 - and he thinks that that is a
wonderful idea.\\
579 - So, he has arranged it with a
television station\\
580 - to put it on TV.\\
581 - TV? Oh...\\
582 - Oh, TV.\\
583 - Oh. Oh, TV.\\
584 - Somebody better think of a way out of
this\\
585 - if she wants to keep her pretty,
little neck\\
586 - in one piece.\\
587 - And think fast.\\
588 - Well, we sold all the tickets.\\
589 - This place is jammed.\\
590 - I know, but do you think it'll work?\\
591 - We'll find out right now.\\
592 - I'll make	    ETHEL: the
announcement.	Okay.\\
593 - (applause)\\
594 - (applause subsiding)\\

\subsection {Episode 26: The Black Wig}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Oh, boy, it's been a long time\\
3 - since I saw a movie that good.\\
4 - RICKY: Those Italians make great
pictures, don't they?\\
5 - Yeah, those women were lookers all
right.\\
6 - But I couldn't understand\\
7 - what the picture was all about.\\
8 - If it isn't Donald Duck, it's over
his head.\\
9 - (chuckles)\\
10 - Honestly.\\
11 - Lucy, didn't you think when she...\\
12 - What's the matter, Lucy?\\
13 - Are you sick?\\
14 - Oh, no, no, don't pay any attention
to her, Ethel.\\
15 - Every time she goes to a movie\\
16 - she comes out as the heroine.\\
17 - It will take a couple of hours to
wear off.\\
18 - Arrivederci, mi amore.\\
19 - Mi amore, arrivederci.\\
20 - What's the matter with her?\\
21 - What do you mean "what's the matter
with her?"\\
22 - Can't you see that this poor women's
husband\\
23 - has just been taken to jail?\\
24 - And she's left there with 12 children\\
25 - that she has to support.\\
26 - She has to work in the rice field\\
27 - to support them.\\
28 - Thank you, Lucille Magnani.\\
29 - How can you be so blase?\\
30 - Don't you feel what she felt?\\
31 - Oh, I think those Italian actresses
are just wonderful.\\
32 - They're so sultry and exciting.\\
33 - They're so... so... Italian.\\
34 - Oh, I'd like to look like that.\\
35 - Oh, what I wouldn't give if I looked
like one of them.\\
36 - What I wouldn't give\\
37 - if you looked like one of them.\\
38 - Molto bene.\\
39 - Bellissimo bambino.\\
40 - Hey, senora, calma down.\\
41 - You know what I'm going to do?\\
42 - Why not?\\
43 - Because I like your hair the way it
is.\\
44 - But it would look so good short.\\
45 - Please?\\
46 - Look, for my son's sake, no.\\
47 - What do you mean, "for your son's
sake"?\\
48 - I'll splain.\\
49 - Okay, "splain."\\
50 - Look, all people in the world are
divided into two groups--\\
51 - men and women.\\
52 - I know. It's a wonderful arrangement.\\
53 - Right.\\
54 - Now, men have short hair, and women
have long hair.\\
55 - That's the difference between them.\\
56 - Oh?\\
57 - Now, I don't want my son to be
confused.\\
58 - He should know whether he should call
you mother\\
59 - or father.\\
60 - Oh, you men.\\
61 - You make me sick.\\
62 - You know, something, Lucy?\\
63 - I think I'll get one of those Italian
haircuts.\\
64 - Now, Ethel, don't get carried away.\\
65 - Leave bad enough alone.\\
66 - Now, I looked pretty good last year\\
67 - when I had my hair cut in a poodle
cut.\\
68 - People couldn't take their eyes off
of me.\\
69 - Sure, they thought you were Harpo
Marx.\\
70 - It doesn't make any difference what
you say.\\
71 - If I want my hair cut short,\\
72 - Oh, Ethel, what's the use?
What's the use?
I'll cut my hair...\\
73 - If we want to stay married\\
74 - we're going to have to go through
life\\
75 - with our heads in a rut.\\
76 - Morning, Doug.\\
77 - Good morning, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
78 - How are you this morning?\\
79 - Fine. Roberta ready?\\
80 - I think so.
Just a moment.\\
81 - Roberta, Mrs. Ricardo's here.\\
82 - Oh, that's the new Italian look, you
know.\\
83 - Yes, I know.\\
84 - I'd have the new Italian look except
for a certain Cuban look.\\
85 - ROBERTA: Good morning, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
86 - Hi, Bert.
You ready?\\
87 - Yeah, come on in.\\
88 - Doug, get me a cup of coffee, will
you?
Sure.\\
89 - Well, what will it be today, the
usual?\\
90 - Yeah, I guess so.\\
91 - My...\\
92 - You should have come in sooner.\\
93 - You've got quite a firebreak here.\\
94 - Now, listen, Bert, no cracks\\
95 - or I'll take my dark roots somewhere
else.\\
96 - Oh, you know, I wanted to get one of
those new Italian cuts\\
97 - but Ricky won't let me.\\
98 - Oh, that's a shame.\\
99 - You'd look darling with your hair
short.\\
100 - Well, I thought so, but he put his
foot down.\\
101 - He does a lot of that, doesn't he?\\
102 - Yeah. If you could harness the energy\\
103 - he uses putting his foot down\\
104 - you could light the whole city of New
York.\\
105 - I get so mad at husbands.\\
106 - They have no imagination about their
wives.\\
107 - No, but they have...\\
108 - You know what you should do?\\
109 - What?\\
110 - Well, you know, you're just going to
be a knockout\\
111 - with an Italian haircut.\\
112 - Surprise him.\\
113 - Let me cut your hair short and fix it
real cute\\
114 - and then spring it on him.
He'll die.\\
115 - Well, one of us will.\\
116 - No, I don't think that's a very good
idea.\\
117 - Oh, listen...\\
118 - Do you think that wig out front would
fit me?\\
119 - Well, yeah, I think so.\\
120 - Well, get it and let me try it on.
Oh, sure. Okay.\\
121 - Just give me an idea of how I'd look,
you know?\\
122 - Here we are.\\
123 - This is fun, isn't it?
Yeah.\\
124 - I don't suppose it'll do much good,
but...\\
125 - Oh, well, at least you can tell.\\
126 - It will give me an idea anyway.\\
127 - Let's see.\\
128 - Where did I go?\\
129 - You look wonderful.\\
130 - Is that me?\\
131 - Sure.\\
132 - Paisan!\\
133 - Mrs. Ricardo, here's your coffee...\\
134 - Oh, pardon me.\\
135 - Mrs. Ricardo?\\
136 - Yeah, it's me.
How do you like it?\\
137 - Why, you look wonderful in that wig.\\
138 - I didn't know you at all.\\
139 - What a difference, huh?\\
140 - I can't get over the difference.\\
141 - Hey, Bert, Ricky's going to pick me
up here.\\
142 - Doug, can I leave this on till he
gets here?\\
143 - Sure, go ahead.\\
144 - You know, if he likes it,\\
145 - maybe he'll let me get my hair cut.\\
146 - Well, it's sure worth a try.\\
147 - What do you think he'll say?\\
148 - I don't think he'll say anything.\\
149 - I don't think he'll know it's you.\\
150 - Oh, he'll know it's me...\\
151 - Well, I don't know.\\
152 - Gee, if he didn't recognize me\\
153 - I'm in a dream spot.\\
154 - What do you mean?\\
155 - I could find out how my husband would
react\\
156 - to a little flirting by a strange
brunette\\
157 - with an Italian haircut.\\
158 - Oh, hi, Mr. Ricardo.\\
159 - Hi.\\
160 - Is this what we have to look forward
to next season?\\
161 - No.\\
162 - Is Mrs. Ricardo ready?\\
163 - Well, uh, we finished a little early\\
164 - and she went to do some shopping.\\
165 - She said for you to meet her out
front\\
166 - and if she's not there by 1:00, don't
wait for her.\\
167 - Okay, thank you.\\
168 - Bye.\\
169 - Gee.\\
170 - Psst. Psst.
Mr. Ricardo?\\
171 - Yeah?\\
172 - Could I speak to you for a moment?\\
173 - Sure.\\
174 - Shh. As the owner of this shop\\
175 - I should respect my customer's
wishes,\\
176 - but as a fellow husband I have to
tell you something.\\
177 - What?\\
178 - You're wife is going to play a very
dirty trick on you.\\
179 - Oh?\\
180 - You know the new Italian haircut?\\
181 - She didn't!
Shh.\\
182 - No, but she did try on a brunette wig\\
183 - with an Italian haircut.\\
184 - Looks like an entirely different
woman.\\
185 - You wouldn't recognize her.\\
186 - Oh, I'd recognize my wife.\\
187 - Now, don't be too sure.\\
188 - I didn't recognize her\\
189 - and I've known her for quite a while.\\
190 - Anyway, she's going to test you with
a little flirtation.\\
191 - If you recognize her, fine.\\
192 - If you don't...\\
193 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
194 - Mira que esta mujer se ocurra\\
195 - cosa extrana en la cabesa.\\
196 - That's exactly the way I feel about
my wife.\\
197 - You speak Spanish?\\
198 - No. Those feeling transcend all
language barriers.\\
199 - Well, I just wanted to be sure that
you'd recognize her.\\
200 - What do you mean "recognize her"?\\
201 - I'm not going to recognize her.\\
202 - Huh?\\
203 - Look, as long as she's in the
driver's seat\\
204 - it would be a shame not to take her
for a little ride.\\
205 - Miss?\\
206 - (clearing throat)\\
207 - Oh, uh...\\
208 - you dropped your glove.\\
209 - Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.\\
210 - You're welcome.\\
211 - Haven't I seen you someplace before?\\
212 - Well... uh, it's possible.\\
213 - I've been someplace before.\\
214 - Well, I'm sure we've met.\\
215 - Have you ever been to the Tropicana
nightclub?\\
216 - Oh, why, of course, you're Ricky
Ricardo.\\
217 - That's right.\\
218 - Oh, well, I should have known.\\
219 - Well...\\
220 - Um...\\
221 - Look, uh, I tell you what, how would
you like\\
222 - to come down to the club one night as
my guest?\\
223 - Well, don't you have to work when
you're at the club?\\
224 - Oh, for you I could find plenty of
time.\\
225 - You and I could make beautiful music
together.\\
226 - I could even teach you how to rumba.\\
227 - What's the matter?\\
228 - Look...\\
229 - we can't talk here.
I'm expecting my wife.\\
230 - Oh, you're married.\\
231 - Well, everybody makes a mistake once
in awhile.\\
232 - I tell you what, honey,\\
233 - call me down at the club.\\
234 - That old battle-ax is going to be
here any minute.\\
235 - Well, tell me, what is your wife
like?\\
236 - I suppose she's very beautiful.\\
237 - Well, she's...\\
238 - she's... she's kind of hard to
describe.\\
239 - Her figure is kind of...\\
240 - and her hair is all...\\
241 - She's a good housekeeper.\\
242 - Look, honey, I think I see her
coming.\\
243 - Now, will you run along, dear?\\
244 - All right.\\
245 - And call me at the club.
Don't forget.\\
246 - Okay. Bye-bye.\\
247 - Bye-bye.\\
248 - Bye-bye.\\
249 - ETHEL: Is that you, Lucy?\\
250 - Oh, I beg your pardon, madam,\\
251 - but you're in the wrong apartment.\\
252 - It's me.\\
253 - Who?\\
254 - Lucy!\\
255 - Lucy?!\\
256 - How's the baby?\\
257 - He's fine. Oh, Lucy!\\
258 - You died your hair black and cut it
all off short.\\
259 - Oh! It looks wonderful!\\
260 - It's a wig.\\
261 - A wig?\\
262 - Oh... what a difference.\\
263 - I honestly didn't know you.\\
264 - You're not the only one.\\
265 - Who else?\\
266 - A certain Cuban with big brown eyes\\
267 - that are soon to be black.\\
268 - The details, the details.\\
269 - Well, Bert tried this wig on me,\\
270 - and nobody recognized me,\\
271 - so I figured I'd have a little fun
with Ricky.\\
272 - You know, I thought if he might like
the haircut,\\
273 - he'd let me have my hair cut\\
274 - and everything would be
hotsie-totsie.\\
275 - Well?\\
276 - Things were never so coldsie-toldsie.\\
277 - Why? What happened?\\
278 - Well, I borrowed these clothes...\\
279 - Those clothes!\\
280 - No wonder I didn't know you.\\
281 - Neither did Ricky.\\
282 - I flirted with him a little\\
283 - and what do you think he had the
nerve to do?\\
284 - What?\\
285 - He flirted back.\\
286 - I'll bet he knew it was you all the
time.\\
287 - He did not.\\
288 - He leered at me and called me "honey"\\
289 - in a tone that I haven't heard\\
290 - since the day before we got married.\\
291 - And then he told me to call him at
the club.\\
292 - And get this bit--\\
293 - Said he wanted to "tich" me to rumba.\\
294 - And then he said, run along\\
295 - because his wife was coming along--\\
296 - or, as I am more commonly known,\\
297 - "the old battle-ax."\\
298 - Well, it's a terrible thing to say
about anybody,\\
299 - but I guess Ricky's just a man.\\
300 - Yeah, well, I'll get even with him.\\
301 - What are you going to do?\\
302 - I'll leave him!\\
303 - No. That's probably what he wants.\\
304 - Yeah. Stay married to him.
That'll teach him.\\
305 - Yeah.\\
306 - Well, I'll think of something.\\
307 - Hey, Lucy.\\
308 - What?\\
309 - Do me a favor, will ya?\\
310 - What?\\
311 - Lend me that wig.\\
312 - What for?\\
313 - I want to try it on Fred.\\
314 - Oh, he'd look great in it.\\
315 - No, I mean, I want to see if he'd
recognize me with it on.\\
316 - Look out. That's how I got into
trouble.\\
317 - That's the kind of trouble I want.\\
318 - I want something to hold over his
head.\\
319 - Well...\\
320 - Come on, loan me the wig, huh?\\
321 - Okay.\\
322 - Have you got a dress that will fit
me?\\
323 - You think he'll recognize yours?\\
324 - I think so, considering I only have
one.\\
325 - Come on, I'll find you something.\\
326 - Okay.\\
327 - Yeah, Fred, it's the basin.\\
328 - Well, it's all stopped up.\\
329 - Would you come over and fix it?\\
330 - Thank you.\\
331 - Ethel?\\
332 - (wolf whistle)\\
333 - Did you call me, darling?\\
334 - Wow!\\
335 - I called Fred.\\
336 - I told him the basin was all stopped
up.\\
337 - He's coming right over.\\
338 - That's great.\\
339 - Gee, turn around.
Let me look at you.\\
340 - When I tell Fred who you are,\\
341 - he's going to beg you to have your
hair cut like that.\\
342 - You really think so?\\
343 - Yeah. How you going to act?\\
344 - Well, I thought I'd sort of flirt
with him.\\
345 - You know, act coy and bat my eyes.\\
346 - And then if he responds, I'll lower
the boom on him.\\
347 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
348 - Hi, Fred.\\
349 - Hi, Lucy.\\
350 - Which sink is it?\\
351 - The one in the bathroom.\\
352 - Oh.\\
353 - Hi, Ethel.\\
354 - Ethel, what in Sam Hill have you done
to your hair?\\
355 - It's a wig.\\
356 - Huh? We've been married for 25 years\\
357 - and now she tells me she wears a wig!\\
358 - Oh, go fix the plumbing.\\
359 - Now I'll never know whether I'm
married to a masher or not.\\
360 - I wish I didn't know.\\
361 - I'm sorry.\\
362 - I brought the wrong wrench.\\
363 - Ethel, why don't you take off that
silly-looking toupee?\\
364 - This is that new Italian haircut.\\
365 - Well, on you it looks like Life with
Luigi.\\
366 - He'll never fall for another woman.\\
367 - I just don't have that kind of luck.\\
368 - Ethel, do you really want to put him
to the test?\\
369 - Do I?
What do you suggest?\\
370 - Well, when I arrange my rendezvous
with Ricky,\\
371 - I'll suggest he make it a double
date.\\
372 - Yeah?\\
373 - I'll ask him if he has a friend.\\
374 - Yeah?\\
375 - I'll tell him I have a friend\\
376 - who's looking for an older man.\\
377 - Older than Fred?\\
378 - You know what I mean?\\
379 - He'll bring Fred, all right.\\
380 - Oh, how we gonna keep him from
recognizing me?\\
381 - He just did.\\
382 - Oh, I don't know.\\
383 - Honestly.\\
384 - Hey! I know the wardrobe woman in a
Broadway review!\\
385 - She could let me have something--\\
386 - maybe an entirely different kind of a
wig\\
387 - and a...
and another sort of an outfit.\\
388 - Yeah, maybe you could wear different
makeup or something.\\
389 - Oh, sure. I'll bet she'll loan me
anything I want.\\
390 - I'm going to call her and see.\\
391 - Oh, I hope so.\\
392 - Gee, that's a wonderful idea.\\
393 - Hello.\\
394 - Hello, is Mother Carroll there?\\
395 - May I speak to her, please?\\
396 - Maybe she could get me one of those
showgirl outfits,\\
397 - you know, with a great big hat...\\
398 - Hello? Mother Carroll?\\
399 - This is Ethel. Mertz.\\
400 - Yeah, listen, I'm in an awful jam.\\
401 - Could you loan me a wig\\
402 - and some sort of costume, an outfit,
to wear?\\
403 - Tonight.\\
404 - Well, just for one night.\\
405 - No. We wouldn't need it till after
the show.\\
406 - You could? Oh, fine.\\
407 - What have you got?\\
408 - Huh?\\
409 - What'd she say?\\
410 - Well, I got three choices:\\
411 - a Japanese geisha girl\\
412 - or an American Indian\\
413 - or an Eskimo.\\
414 - An Eskimo?\\
415 - Yeah...\\
416 - Huh?\\
417 - Oh, oh, all right, honey.\\
418 - We'll be down at the theater.\\
419 - Thanks a lot.\\
420 - She says to come on down.\\
421 - She can get some sort of an outfit
together.\\
422 - Yeah, they got a lot of costumes down
there.\\
423 - Look, now, I'll call Ricky\\
424 - and tell him we'll meet him at
Tony's--\\
425 - the little Italian restaurant.\\
426 - Yeah, great.\\
427 - Sit down, please.\\
428 - Tell me, Fred,\\
429 - what are you going to be doing about
2:00 a.m.?\\
430 - Well, snoring my head off.\\
431 - Why?\\
432 - Can I talk you out of it?\\
433 - I don't think so, Rick.\\
434 - I've been going to bed at 10:00 for
ten years.\\
435 - Uh, I really need the rest.\\
436 - (chuckling)\\
437 - Well, that's too bad.\\
438 - What did you have in mind?\\
439 - I could make a date for you with a
beautiful girl.\\
440 - Where will I meet you?\\
441 - You changed your mind in an awful
hurry.\\
442 - What happened to this rest you've
been getting for years?\\
443 - Well, what do you think I've been
resting up for?\\
444 - Uh, look, I made a date this
afternoon.\\
445 - You?\\
446 - Yeah. I made a date this afternoon\\
447 - with a beautiful brunette with a
short Italian haircut.\\
448 - (wolf whistle)\\
449 - And, uh, she called me at the club\\
450 - and she said she has a girlfriend\\
451 - and they want to make it a double
date.\\
452 - And this girlfriend told me... told
her...\\
453 - that she prefers the more
sophisticated, older-type men.\\
454 - (British accent): Well, how do you
do, my dear?\\
455 - I am delighted to meet you.\\
456 - (normal voice): Hey, what is this?\\
457 - You've never done anything like this
before.\\
458 - Oh, Lucy knows all about it.\\
459 - Oh... What?!\\
460 - You see, the brunette with the
Italian haircut\\
461 - is Lucy with a wig.\\
462 - Huh?\\
463 - She borrowed the wig from a beauty
parlor.\\
464 - Oh... then your date is really going
to be Lucy.\\
465 - That's right.\\
466 - And I got a slight hunch\\
467 - that the girlfriend she's bringing
along is Ethel.\\
468 - On second thought, Rick, I need my
rest.\\
469 - Now, since when have you been too
tired\\
470 - to play a trick on Ethel?\\
471 - Well, if you're going to put it that
way\\
472 - I can't hardly resist.\\
473 - Okay, now, here's what I want you to
do...\\
474 - Uh, good night, honey.\\
475 - I got to go to work.\\
476 - Good night.\\
477 - Anything you want me to get before I
go?\\
478 - No.\\
479 - Uh, something I can bring you?\\
480 - Just bring yourself home, I'll be
satisfied.\\
481 - Well, good-bye, dear.\\
482 - Good-bye.\\
483 - I just saw Ricky leave.\\
484 - Fred's getting ready.\\
485 - Good, then he fell for it.\\
486 - Oh, he says he has to sit up tonight
with a sick friend.\\
487 - Well, that "sick friend" is going to
be a lot sicker\\
488 - when I get through with him.\\
489 - I wish you could have seen Fred
getting dressed.\\
490 - I haven't seen him move that fast\\
491 - since he backed into a hot radiator
in his union suit.\\
492 - Well, I knew it, Ethel.\\
493 - He's just as bad as Ricky is.\\
494 - Oh, I can hardly wait till we meet
them.\\
495 - Say, what are we going to do till
2:00?\\
496 - Well, we have to go down to the
theater\\
497 - and pick up your costume.\\
498 - I'll go get Mrs. Trumbull to take
care of little Ricky.\\
499 - Maybe we can go to a midnight movie.\\
500 - Great.\\
501 - Now, Ethel, whatever you do, don't...\\
502 - Come on!\\
503 - Come on, Ethel.\\
504 - You look fine.\\
505 - Oh, this is ridiculous.\\
506 - I'm just not going to go in there.\\
507 - Now, Ethel, believe me.\\
508 - You look exotic, exciting.\\
509 - Now, you look fine.\\
510 - Only to a Japanese Eskimo.\\
511 - Well, We're not going to back out
now. Come on.\\
512 - If I could have just got one complete
outfit that fit.\\
513 - But you know this is silly.\\
514 - Come on.
Come on, now, Ethel.\\
515 - Come on. Come on.\\
516 - They're not here.\\
517 - Well, come on, sit down.\\
518 - Take off your coat.\\
519 - No.\\
520 - Take off your coat.\\
521 - You look more conspicuous with it on\\
522 - than you would with it off.\\
523 - That's what you think.\\
524 - You look like an ad for a trip around
the world.\\
525 - That does it, brother.\\
526 - I'm not going any farther...
Now, come on, Ethel,\\
527 - sit down here.\\
528 - Now, sit down.\\
529 - This thing is alive.\\
530 - Oh, dear, it's 20 after 2:00.\\
531 - Are you sure they said "Tony's"?\\
532 - I'm positive.\\
533 - Oh, waiter, pardon me, please.\\
534 - Yes, ma'am.\\
535 - We have an appointment with a couple
of gentlemen.\\
536 - Have you seen them?\\
537 - What do they look like?\\
538 - Well, one is tall, dark and handsome\\
539 - and speaks with an accent.\\
540 - And the other is, um...\\
541 - uh...\\
542 - the other is, uh...\\
543 - There's one way to say it-- short,
fat and bald.\\
544 - Oh, yeah, they were here.\\
545 - Were here?\\
546 - There were two young ladies sitting
at that table.\\
547 - Beautiful-- a blonde and a redhead.\\
548 - They got talking\\
549 - and then they all got up\\
550 - and left together.\\
551 - Oh, Ethel...\\
552 - Oh, Lucy...\\
553 - It's all our fault.\\
554 - If we hadn't made a date to meet them
here,\\
555 - they wouldn't have met those other
girls.\\
556 - Yes.\\
557 - You know what?\\
558 - I wish I was dead.\\
559 - You know what?\\
560 - I wish you was dead, too.\\
561 - Me?\\
562 - Well, you started all of this.\\
563 - Well, let's not fight each other.\\
564 - We're all we've got.\\
565 - Yeah. Well...\\
566 - (both sniffling)\\
567 - Come on, let's go home.\\
568 - All right.\\
569 - Are you free tonight, girls?\\
570 - Ricky!\\
571 - Were you expecting an older man?\\
572 - Fred!\\
573 - Listen, let's get out of here, girls,\\
574 - before my wife shows up-- that old
battle-ax.\\
575 - Oh, so you were playing a little
trick.\\
576 - You think you're very clever, don't
you?\\
577 - Come on, Ethel.\\
578 - Ricky!
Fred!\\
579 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
580 - I Love Lucy is a Desilu production.\\
581 - Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz\\
582 - will be back next week at this same
time.
\subsection {Episode 27: The Diner}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Can I borrow some cream?\\
3 - Shh! Not so loud.\\
4 - (whispering): Good morning, Lucy.\\
5 - Can I borrow some cream?\\
6 - What's the matter?\\
7 - Someone who shall be nameless is in a
Cuban snit this morning.\\
8 - Oh. What did you do?\\
9 - Nothing!\\
10 - Everything went wrong down at the
club last night.\\
11 - The cleaner forgot to bring his
tuxedo.\\
12 - One act didn't show up.\\
13 - Right in the middle of his big
number,\\
14 - the lights went out all over the
whole neighborhood.\\
15 - Oh. How long did that last?\\
16 - For hours.\\
17 - Everybody got up and, and left\\
18 - and went into the nightclub across
the street.\\
19 - How'd they manage without
electricity?\\
20 - Liberace was playing there.\\
21 - Huh?\\
22 - He does his show by candlelight.\\
23 - Oh.\\
24 - (laughing)\\
25 - Sure.\\
26 - (laughing)\\
27 - Oh, well, I don't blame Ricky for
being sore.\\
28 - Well, neither do I, but things aren't
going to be\\
29 - very pleasant around here today.\\
30 - He's as grumpy as a kangaroo with a
porcupine in his pouch.\\
31 - You want some coffee?\\
32 - No, thanks. Fred's waiting for his
breakfast.\\
33 - I'll just get my cream.\\
34 - Oh, gee, I envy you, Ethel.\\
35 - Why?\\
36 - Because Fred is so predictable.\\
37 - You never have to worry about\\
38 - what kind of a mood he's going to be
in.\\
39 - Yeah, he's always got a porcupine in
his pouch.\\
40 - (laughing)\\
41 - Hi, honey.\\
42 - Well, that's not the only thing
that's sour around here.\\
43 - What do you mean?\\
44 - You might at least say good morning
to Ethel.\\
45 - Hi.\\
46 - Oh, I liked it better when he ignored
me.\\
47 - Well, don't worry, Ethel.\\
48 - He'll get over it.\\
49 - Oh, sure.\\
50 - He'll soon be his usual old charming,\\
51 - smiling self, won't you, Ricky?\\
52 - (guffawing)\\
53 - No, Ethel...\\
54 - Aw, I can make Ricky smile.\\
55 - Come on now, Ricky, smile for me.\\
56 - I can make you smile.\\
57 - (laughing)\\
58 - Aw, now, Ricky, how would it be\\
59 - if your face froze like that?\\
60 - How would it be if you minded your
own business?\\
61 - Well!\\
62 - Doesn't your little playmate ever go
home?\\
63 - Hi, honey bunch.\\
64 - Oh, shut up.\\
65 - Now, what did I do?\\
66 - You're just as grumpy as he is.\\
67 - Well, what did I do?\\
68 - Nothing, Fred.\\
69 - Ethel's upset at Ricky.\\
70 - Now, Ricky, you tell Ethel you're
sorry for what you said.\\
71 - I'm sorry, Ethel.\\
72 - Yeah.\\
73 - I mean it.\\
74 - I'm, I'm sorry.\\
75 - I'm just so upset, I don't know what
I'm doing.\\
76 - Now, what's Lucy done?\\
77 - Nothing!\\
78 - Why is it always my fault?\\
79 - Hmm. Oh, really, Fred, Lucy had
nothing to do this time.\\
80 - I apologize.\\
81 - Well, all right.\\
82 - It's just that everything went wrong\\
83 - at the club last night.\\
84 - The guy didn't bring my tuxedo...\\
85 - Now, honey, honey, honey...
The guy went out\\
86 - Listen, honey, honey, in the
middle...\\
87 - don't talk about it anymore.\\
88 - You're just going to get yourself all
upset again.\\
89 - Okay. I'm telling you,\\
90 - anybody that goes into show business\\
91 - should have his head examined.\\
92 - I would quit the whole thing for two
centavos.\\
93 - Oh... I wish I had a nickel for every
time he's offered\\
94 - to quit show business for two
centavos.\\
95 - Well, if I had any sense,\\
96 - I'd be in some regular business.\\
97 - Any business is a pain in the neck.\\
98 - Not like show business.\\
99 - Not much.\\
100 - How do you think I feel\\
101 - worrying every time a tenant is going
to move out\\
102 - and listening to all their silly
complaints?\\
103 - (in falsetto): "My drain is stopped
up!"\\
104 - "I've lost my key!"\\
105 - "When are you going to fix my leaky
faucet?!"\\
106 - Listen, speaking about leaky faucets,
when are you gonna...\\
107 - Uh... not now.\\
108 - No, not now, Lucy.\\
109 - I'm telling you,\\
110 - I'm gonna keep my eye open for a real
business\\
111 - and when I find it, bye-bye, show
business.\\
112 - Okay. Let me know when you find
something.\\
113 - All right.\\
114 - Come on, Ethel.
I'm hungry.\\
115 - Okay, see you later.\\
116 - All right, dear.
Bye.\\
117 - Bye.
Bye.\\
118 - Oh, yeah...\\
119 - Oh, hi, Poppy.\\
120 - Hi. How are you?\\
121 - Hey, did you have a nice walk, old
man?\\
122 - Yes, but he's getting tired.\\
123 - Oh, what's up, baby?\\
124 - Hello, son, how are you?\\
125 - Are you still looking at those want
ads?\\
126 - Yes, Mommy, I'm still looking at
them.\\
127 - We got to take our nap.\\
128 - Okay, sweetheart, take your nap.\\
129 - Come on, baby, darling.\\
130 - (fussing)\\
131 - Well, we let him stay up too long.\\
132 - Come on, baby, darling.\\
133 - Hi, Rick.\\
134 - Oh, hi, Fred.\\
135 - Oh, boy, what a swell day.\\
136 - How about a little game of golf?\\
137 - Uh, I'd love to, Fred, but I'm
looking into some\\
138 - business opportunities here that I
might go into.\\
139 - Oh, you're really serious, huh?\\
140 - You're darn right I am.\\
141 - Well, if you find something good, let
me know.\\
142 - Hey, were you serious this morning\\
143 - when you offered to go into it with
me?\\
144 - I don't remember offering,\\
145 - but if you've got a good deal,\\
146 - sure I'm in.\\
147 - Fred, don't encourage him.\\
148 - I've gone through this with him a
million times.\\
149 - Never mind.\\
150 - (chuckling)\\
151 - Now, here's some of the ones that
look best.\\
152 - Yeah.\\
153 - "Delicatessen for sale, cheap."\\
154 - RICKY: You know, the one down on the
corner makes a mint.\\
155 - Oh, Ricky, a delicatessen.\\
156 - What's wrong with a delicatessen?\\
157 - I can just see it: "Ricky Ricardo's
Delicatessen.\\
158 - Cuban-Style Blintzes."\\
159 - She's right, Rick.\\
160 - It doesn't quite have the right ring.\\
161 - Well, there's a lot of stuff here.\\
162 - All right, let's see it.\\
163 - Lucy?
What?\\
164 - Is Fred over here?\\
165 - There he is, with Ricky Ricardo, the
Salami King.\\
166 - Huh?\\
167 - They're figuring out what business to
go into.\\
168 - Business?
Yeah.\\
169 - Fred Mertz, what's this about you
going in business?\\
170 - I haven't made any deal.\\
171 - I thought if we saw something good,\\
172 - we might go in it.\\
173 - After all, we've got a few bucks put
aside.\\
174 - Oh, have you, Ethel?\\
175 - Only every dollar we ever made,
that's all.\\
176 - Hey, it might be fun if we were all
partners.\\
177 - Let me see that list, Ricky.\\
178 - I'll read it to you.\\
179 - Oh, the delicatessen is out, you
said, so...\\
180 - RICKY: How about a cocktail bar?\\
181 - No.\\
182 - Now, the next one is something I've
always wanted to own.\\
183 - What's that?
A diner.\\
184 - A diner?	    Diner?\\
185 - Honey, we don't know anything about
running a diner.\\
186 - Fred and I do.
We worked in one once\\
187 - when we were stranded in
Indianapolis. Remember, Fred?\\
188 - LUCY: Really?\\
189 - Sure. "Adam and Eve on a raft. Wreck
'em."\\
190 - "Scrambled eggs on toast coming up."\\
191 - That's wonderful.\\
192 - You know, with, with Fred and Ethel's
know-how,\\
193 - and I got a good following down at
the club,\\
194 - we should have a lot of customers.\\
195 - Sure. This is just perfect for the
four of us.\\
196 - Fred and I have the know-how\\
197 - and Ricky has the name, and Lucy
has...\\
198 - Uh... Lucy has, uh...\\
199 - My name is the same as his.\\
200 - Ah, don't you worry, honey.\\
201 - There'll be plenty for all of us to
do.\\
202 - Oh, sure, we couldn't do anything
without you.\\
203 - That's right.
I hope not.\\
204 - Look at that. Don't you think that
looks good?\\
205 - "Enjoy security and independence by
owning your own business.\\
206 - Fully equipped..."\\
207 - Well, that's it, folks.\\
208 - Isn't this the sweetest little diner
you ever saw?\\
209 - Oh, it's a darling.\\
210 - Just cute as a bug.\\
211 - You say this place does good
business?\\
212 - You ought to see 'em.\\
213 - Three deep at the counter all day
long.\\
214 - Really?
Uh-huh.\\
215 - We have to close once a week to let
the seats cool off.\\
216 - (guffawing)\\
217 - Well, would you, uh, pardon us?\\
218 - Uh... may I...
Certainly.\\
219 - Excuse us a minute, please.\\
220 - Go ahead.
Yeah.\\
221 - (quiet conversation)\\
222 - RICKY: You want to do it?\\
223 - Okay, okay.
(murmuring)\\
224 - Well, Mr. Watson, you just sold a
diner!\\
225 - Wonderful. I know you won't be sorry.\\
226 - Will you just sign this purchase
agreement,\\
227 - and I'll meet you at the bank in the
morning\\
228 - to complete the deal.
Yes, sir.\\
229 - Looks all right, huh, Fred?\\
230 - Fine, yeah.
2,000.\\
231 - 2000.
That's right.\\
232 - Okay.\\
233 - Sign it, Fred.\\
234 - Yes, sir.\\
235 - Here are the keys.\\
236 - Oh.
Easy.\\
237 - There you are!\\
238 - Thank you.\\
239 - You're welcome.
Thank you.\\
240 - Bye-bye.\\
241 - Well, I'll see you RICKY:      at the
bank.
Yes, sir.\\
242 - Bye.
Bye.\\
243 - Oh, isn't he a nice man?\\
244 - He sure is.\\
245 - We own a diner, we own a diner!\\
246 - Isn't it wonderful?\\
247 - Hey, we got to take this sign down.\\
248 - Oh, that's right.
Yeah!\\
249 - Oh, we'll have to get another name.\\
250 - What'll it be?\\
251 - Well, now, let's see, uh...\\
252 - I got it.
I got it!\\
253 - Oh, you go ahead, Fred.\\
254 - No, you go ahead.\\
255 - Well, I was just thinking out loud,\\
256 - you know, but, uh, how about, uh,
Ricky's place?\\
257 - You know, I had the same thought.\\
258 - You did?\\
259 - With one slight change.\\
260 - What's that?\\
261 - Fred's place.\\
262 - Now, look, Fred, yesterday you said\\
263 - that you got the know-how and I got
the name\\
264 - and my name ain't Fred.\\
265 - Uh, look, I think people like to eat\\
266 - where a woman does the cooking.\\
267 - I think we should use a woman's name.\\
268 - What woman's name did you have in
mind?\\
269 - Uh, it starts with an "L."\\
270 - Lucy...\\
271 - That's right.\\
272 - Oh...\\
273 - RICKY: Now, now, look.
Now, look.\\
274 - (Lucy and Ethel arguing)\\
275 - Now, look, there's no use arguing
about this.\\
276 - I tell you what we'll do.\\
277 - What?\\
278 - Well, let's not use any of our names.\\
279 - Why not?\\
280 - Well, my idea was to have a diner\\
281 - that, uh, served Cuban food.\\
282 - LUCY: Yeah.\\
283 - Right? All right.\\
284 - So, let's use something different and
catchy like, uh...\\
285 - A Little Bit Of Cuba.\\
286 - Hey, I like that.
I like that.\\
287 - Huh, you like that?\\
288 - (all talking)
A Little Bit of Cuba.\\
289 - Oh.\\
290 - Have a good dinner, Ralph?\\
291 - Oh, very fine.\\
292 - Well, I'm glad you came over.\\
293 - There you are.\\
294 - Thank you, and come again.\\
295 - Thank you for coming, boy.\\
296 - Say hello to the family.\\
297 - I will.\\
298 - Good-bye.\\
299 - Bye-bye.\\
300 - (chuckling)\\
301 - Oh, hello, Joe!\\
302 - Hi, Ricky.
Hi, Joe.\\
303 - Look-- Joe!
Lucy, howdy.\\
304 - What do you think of the place, huh?\\
305 - It's a swell spot.
Yeah, this is terrific.\\
306 - Come on, I got a ringside seat right
here for you.\\
307 - Oh, thanks.
Sit right down there, Joe.\\
308 - There you are, Joe.
Oh, thanks, Lucy.\\
309 - Nice to see you.\\
310 - Fred, take good care of my friend Joe
here.\\
311 - Yes, indeed, I will.\\
312 - Good evening, sir.
What'll you have?\\
313 - Let's see, uh....\\
314 - What's this, "Little Bit of Cuba"
Special?\\
315 - Well, sir, that's something Ricky
dreamed up.\\
316 - It's a hamburger patty\\
317 - smothered in Tabasco sauce and mashed
banana\\
318 - between two tortillas.\\
319 - I think I'll just have a hamburger.\\
320 - Hamburger?\\
321 - Rare.
Rare.\\
322 - What'll you have on it?\\
323 - Everything but onions.\\
324 - Walk a cow past the stove and don't
cry over it.\\
325 - Coming up.\\
326 - And coffee.\\
327 - Cup of mud coming up.\\
328 - Hey, Alberto!\\
329 - Hi, Ricky.\\
330 - Look, Alberto's here.
Hi, Lucy.\\

Sit down.\\
337 - There you are.
There you are.\\
338 - Hey, Fred, take good care of my
friend Alberto here.\\
339 - Oh, yes, indeed.\\
340 - Good evening, sir.
What'll you have?\\
341 - I think I'll try hash.\\
342 - Hash?
There's a gambler in the house.\\
343 - Hash coming up.\\
344 - Gee, honey, isn't this fun?\\
345 - Oh, it's just great.\\
346 - Just what I always wanted.\\
347 - And we're making a whole bunch of
money.\\
348 - I know, and the best part of it\\
349 - it's so easy to run.\\
350 - Yeah, I'm surprised.\\
351 - I thought it was going to be a lot of
work.\\
352 - I tell you, it's a cinch.\\
353 - I know. I just love it.\\
354 - MAN: Hey, how about my pancakes?\\
355 - How about my coffee?\\
356 - Coming right up.\\
357 - Where are those pancakes?\\
358 - You didn't order any hotcakes.\\
359 - I did, too.\\
360 - Well, I didn't hear you.\\
361 - Here are your four hot dogs, though.\\
362 - I didn't order hot dogs.\\
363 - Well, somebody did.\\
364 - MAN: How about my pancakes?\\
365 - They're coming right up.\\
366 - Uh, yes, sir, uh, I'll fix them right
away, sir.\\
367 - Well, Marco!
Ricky.\\
368 - Welcome to A Little Bit Of Cuba!\\
369 - Sit right down here, boy.\\
370 - Sit right down there.\\
371 - LUCY: There you are, Marco.
Nice to see you.\\
372 - (Ricky chuckling)\\
373 - Ai-yi...\\
374 - Things all right over here?\\
375 - Good, good.\\
376 - Say, uh...\\
377 - (snapping fingers)
Psst!\\
378 - We need more butter here.\\
379 - (snapping fingers)\\
380 - More butter here.\\
381 - Who does he think he is?\\
382 - I'm a partner, too, you know.\\
383 - How come we're back here doing all
the work\\
384 - and they're out there having all the
fun?\\
385 - I don't know, but it's time we made a
change.\\
386 - You're right.\\
387 - We're gonna have a lot of good food,
you know.\\
388 - We're gonna have arroz con pollo,\\
389 - frijoles, paella, everything.\\
390 - All the stuff, you know.\\
391 - There you are.\\
392 - (chattering)\\
393 - There you go.\\
394 - What's that for?\\
395 - It's time for the swing shift.\\
396 - What are you doing?!\\
397 - Well, we've just been thinking.\\
398 - Maybe we'd better trade.\\
399 - You're out here doing all the work,\\
400 - and we're back there having all the
fun.\\
401 - Fred, I don't know what to do back
there.\\
402 - Oh, it's very simple.\\
403 - You just put the meat on the griddle,\\
404 - and when your face gets redder than
the hamburger, it's done.\\
405 - Ethel, what's the matter with you?\\
406 - Now, look, Ethel,\\
407 - you are supposed to be behind the
counter.\\
408 - You got the know-how.\\
409 - And look, Ricky has to be here
greeting guests.\\
410 - He has the name.\\
411 - Yeah, and I know what it is.\\
412 - Now, look, for the last time,\\
413 - are you two going to get behind that
counter or nut?\\
414 - For the last time, are you two\\
415 - gonna get behind that counter or
"nut"?\\
416 - No!\\
417 - It doesn't		LUCY: make
any sense.	   No.\\
418 - Well, we can't all be out in front,\\
419 - so it'd better be you.\\
420 - Well, all right.\\
421 - That's better.
That's more better.\\
422 - Come on.
Come on, dear.\\
423 - Where are you going?\\
424 - What...?\\
425 - Have fun.\\
426 - MAN: How about my hamburger?\\
427 - Ethel...
How about my hamburger?\\
428 - MAN: Come on.
I got to go to work.\\
429 - I can't be hanging around here.\\
430 - I've got work to do.\\
431 - Gee whiz...\\
432 - (grumbling)\\
433 - Now, look, the next time\\
434 - that we get a customer in here,\\
435 - will you please try to get the order
right?\\
436 - We had four customers in here today\\
437 - and you loused up every one of their
orders.\\
438 - Well, it's hard to keep track of that
many orders.\\
439 - What are you talking about?\\
440 - They were each here at different
times.\\
441 - Well, I'm doing my best.\\
442 - You have to have experience for this
kind of work\\
443 - and I've never done it before.\\
444 - Oh, now, honey, don't cry.\\
445 - You'll get the food all salty.\\
446 - Besides, it's all your fault.\\
447 - My fault?\\
448 - Yeah, yelling all those crazy things
at me.\\
449 - That was diner talk, like Fred did.\\
450 - Yeah, well, the next time\\
451 - you want hamburgers without onions,\\
452 - ask for hamburgers without onions.\\
453 - Don't stand there and yell,\\
454 - "Bring the bull in the ring and laugh
in his face!"\\
455 - (crying)\\
456 - Good morning, Ricky.\\
457 - Good morning.\\
458 - Good morning, Lucy.\\
459 - Hello.\\
460 - Well, I see business is booming.\\
461 - This is the first lull we had all
morning.\\
462 - Now, listen, once and for all, if we
come back,\\
463 - are you going to take turns doing the
dirty work?\\
464 - Now, look, Fred,\\
465 - you got the know-how and I got the
name.\\
466 - I told you, Ethel.\\
467 - This guy knows two songs: "Babalu"\\
468 - and "You Got The Know-How, I Got The
Name Blues."\\
469 - That's what we agreed on.\\
470 - LUCY: Certainly.\\
471 - Now get this straight.\\
472 - Ethel and I are not going to stay
back there\\
473 - working our heads off\\
474 - while you two are leading a gay
social whirl out front.\\
475 - Well, this is a fine mess.\\
476 - What are we going to do about it?\\
477 - Well, we thought if you wanted to buy
us out, we...\\
478 - Buy you out?!\\
479 - I wouldn't put another cent in this
joint.\\
480 - Well, we haven't got enough money to
buy you out.\\
481 - Well...\\
482 - Well, what are we gonna do?\\
483 - Half of it is yours, and half of it
is ours.\\
484 - Let's split it.\\
485 - Split it?\\
486 - Sure. That would solve everything.\\
487 - Yours is the half behind the counter\\
488 - and ours is the half in front.\\
489 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
490 - What do you want to do, split it down
the middle?\\
491 - Hey, that might be a good idea.\\
492 - It'd teach you a lesson.\\
493 - You'd go broke in ten minutes\\
494 - without us showing you what to do.\\
495 - We'd go broke?!
Oh, come now...\\
496 - Ha! There wouldn't be a customer in
this joint\\
497 - if it wasn't for Ricky's name on the
front door.\\
498 - Well, isn't that funny?\\
499 - RICKY: What are you talking about?\\
500 - LUCY: I mean that.\\
501 - I know you don't...\\
502 - All right, all right, all right, all
right,\\
503 - all right, we'll split it right down
the middle\\
504 - and we'll see who does the best.\\
505 - Okay.		    Okay.\\
506 - Okay!	    Okay!\\
507 - Okay.
All right.\\
508 - This is our half.
That is your half.\\
509 - Okay.\\
510 - Right.
All right.\\
511 - Either buy something or get off our
stool.\\
512 - What time is it?\\
513 - 3:30.\\
514 - What's the matter, have people
stopped eating or something?\\
515 - We could have hung out a sign that
said "measles"\\
516 - and done better business.\\
517 - Don't make jokes.\\
518 - That's a joke?\\
519 - Look, it's nothing to kid about, you
know.\\
520 - We're just about to lose 2,000
hard-earned bucks.\\
521 - I don't know how I ever got mixed up
into this.\\
522 - Why did I let Fred talk me into this?\\
523 - Me?!\\
524 - You're the one that wanted\\
525 - to quit show business.\\
526 - Don't blame it onto me.\\
527 - You had the name.\\
528 - Yeah, and you had the know-how.\\
529 - Where's your know-how now?\\
530 - We got no customers no-how.\\
531 - Oh, what's the difference\\
532 - who has the know-how who has the
name?\\
533 - Who has the customers?\\
534 - Yeah. Where are the customers?\\
535 - MAN: Where do you want these?\\
536 - Oh, right here.\\
537 - Right here, please.\\
538 - Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.\\
539 - Oh, I beg your pardon.\\
540 - Would you put them in the middle,
please?\\
541 - We have to divide them.\\
542 - Thank you very much.\\
543 - I'd like to report a missing rail.\\
544 - This isn't a bar, it's a diner.\\
545 - We serve food here.\\
546 - Food?!\\
547 - FRED: Yeah. How about something to
eat?\\
548 - RICKY: Yeah, right over here, sir.\\
549 - (lisping)
I'll drink to that.\\
550 - RICKY: Right here.
Right here.\\
551 - Oh, right over here, sir.
Here you are, sir.\\
552 - Right here.	     Right here.\\
553 - Mister, mister... mister.\\
554 - Mister,\\
555 - mister...\\
556 - Ethel, we're trying to get him over
here,\\
557 - not drive him away.\\
558 - Mister, b-best hamburgers in town, 15
cents.\\
559 - Well, that sounds pretty good.\\
560 - Uh...
look, mister.\\
561 - 14 cents.\\
562 - Well, I like to save a penny when I
can.\\
563 - That's right, sir.\\
564 - Sit right down.
We'll get it\\
565 - for you right away.\\
566 - Mister, 13 cents.\\
567 - Look, mister, ten cents.\\
568 - Ten cents.\\
569 - Five cents.\\
570 - Four.\\
571 - Three.\\
572 - Two.\\
573 - One. One-cent hamburgers.\\
574 - Ethel, are you losing your mind?\\
575 - ETHEL: Well, I don't want them to get
him.\\
576 - FRED: One-cent hamburgers.\\
577 - (cash register bell ringing)\\
578 - Here you go.\\
579 - I'd like a hundred hamburgers.\\
580 - (Ricky and Lucy laughing)\\
581 - I'm sorry, we're all out of
hamburgers.\\
582 - Yeah.\\
583 - (laughing)\\
584 - They're all out of hamburgers.\\
585 - Well, it's just as well, sir.\\
586 - You wouldn't have liked them anyway.\\
587 - Yeah, even at a cent apiece, they're
overcharging you.\\
588 - LUCY: Yeah.\\
589 - At least we put meat in ours.\\
590 - Yeah.\\
591 - And just what are you insinuating we
put in ours?\\
592 - I'm not saying,\\
593 - but you can bet on it in the
afternoon\\
594 - and eat it at night.\\
595 - So help me, I'm gonna...\\
596 - Go ahead.
Throw it.\\
597 - Oh, wouldn't I love to.\\
598 - You wouldn't dare!\\
599 - Oh, wouldn't I?!\\
600 - Lucy!
Ethel!\\
601 - Come on, and I'd like to see a good
pie fight!\\
602 - Ethel, those pies cost money, you
know.\\
603 - Girls! Go back to work!\\
604 - Back to work, everybody.\\
605 - Come on, now.
Stop fooling around.\\
606 - Let's go back to work.\\
607 - Come on.\\
608 - Okay, Lucy...\\
609 - you asked for it.\\
610 - Girls, what are you doing?!\\
611 - RICKY: Girls!\\
612 - What are you doing?!\\
613 - Look at...\\
614 - (laughing): Oh, no!\\
615 - (laughing uncontrollably)\\
616 - (Ricky continues laughing)\\
617 - Oh, you... silly people.\\
618 - (laughing)\\
619 - Oh, Mr. Watson!\\

624 - What can we do for you, Mr. Watson?\\
625 - Well, I come down to see\\
626 - what I could do for you,\\
627 - but you seem to be having lots of
fun.\\
628 - Just a little recreation.\\
629 - We're entertaining our customers.\\
630 - Oh. Well, to tell the truth,\\
631 - I got lonesome for the old place,\\
632 - and I just dropped down to look
around.\\
633 - WATSON: I sure miss it.\\
634 - Oh?
ETHEL: Really?\\
635 - Oh, yeah.\\
636 - Uh...
well, Mr. Watson,\\
637 - I don't blame you for missing the
place\\
638 - because, you know, it's, it's really
a gold mine.\\
639 - Oh, yeah, it's better than\\
640 - we ever thought it was gonna be.\\
641 - Crowded all the time.\\
642 - Yes, sir.\\
643 - You really miss it, eh?\\
644 - LUCY: You miss it, huh, Mr. Watson?\\
645 - I sure do. Matter of fact, I'm sorry
I sold it.\\
646 - Oh.	    Oh.\\
647 - Yeah, well, we sure don't want you\\
648 - to be unhappy, Mr. Watson.\\
649 - Maybe I can talk Ricky and Fred into
giving it up.\\
650 - Oh, well, I don't know about that.\\
651 - I'd certainly like to have it back.\\
652 - Yeah, he'd like to have it back,
dear.\\
653 - Well, I mean, if you really feel that
way,\\
654 - we'll see what we can do about it.\\
655 - Yeah.\\
656 - I mean, we... we paid $2,000 for the
place.\\
657 - Yeah.
$2000, that's right.\\
658 - And we put a lot of work in this
place.\\
659 - We've done a lot of things, Mr.
Watson.\\
660 - And we've developed quite a
clientele, you know.\\
661 - Everybody from the club comes down
here, you know.\\
662 - But, uh, we, we don't want you to be
sad about it\\
663 - and we like you.\\
664 - You're a real nice man.\\
665 - So I'll tell you what we'll do.\\
666 - We'll let it go for...
$3,000.\\
667 - I can only give you 1,200.\\
668 - ALL: We'll take it.\\
669 - Good.\\
670 - You just bought yourself back a
diner.\\
671 - Yes, sir, you bought yourself a
diner.\\
672 - We'll be the first ones to eat with
you.\\
673 - Yeah, we'll come in and have a piece
of pie.\\
674 - (all laughing and talking at once)\\
675 - Yeah.\\
676 - Let's go.\\
677 - Careful now.
Careful, fellas.\\
678 - Listen, my good man.\\
679 - You have been so nice.\\
680 - I want you to have this\\
681 - and take it home to your family.\\
682 - For me? 	Yes, sir.\\
683 - Well, thank you.\\
684 - You're welcome.\\
685 - It's a shame.\\
686 - They're such nice people.\\
687 - Nobody makes any money these days.\\
688 - I do. I make a fortune.\\
689 - How?\\
690 - Selling this place and buying it back
from people\\
691 - who want to go into business for
themselves.\\
692 - Why, you...\\

1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Hi.\\
3 - Oh, hi, Fred.\\
4 - This special-delivery letter just
came for you.\\
5 - Oh, thanks.
You're welcome.\\
6 - Don't you want to know what it's
about? It looks important.\\
7 - You've got the wrong Mertz.\\
8 - You're thinking about the Buttinsky
branch of the family.\\
9 - I'll go tell Ethel to put on her
earphones\\
10 - and stand by for a news flash.\\
11 - Okay.\\
12 - Ricky! Ricky!\\
13 - Special delivery!\\
14 - Huh?\\
15 - Who is it from?\\
16 - My mother.\\
17 - Now, Ricky.\\
18 - It must be important.\\
19 - It can't be important to me.\\
20 - She doesn't even know I'm alive.\\
21 - Oh, honey, she does, too.\\
22 - She always writes to both of us.\\
23 - Yeah?
Sure.\\
24 - Who's that letter addressed to?\\
25 - "Miss Lucy McGillicuddy."\\
26 - Uh-huh.\\
27 - Well, honey, you know how mothers
are.\\
28 - To Mama, I'll always be\\
29 - her little daughter Lucy
McGillicuddy.\\
30 - But she knows who I'm married to.\\
31 - Yeah? Then why does she always write:
"Dear Lucy,\\
32 - How are you, and how is
what's-his-name?"\\
33 - Oh, honey.\\
34 - "Dear Lucy,\\
35 - How are you, and how is Xavier?"\\
36 - Xavier?\\
37 - Well, honey, she knows\\
38 - I'm married to a Latin-American
bandleader.\\
39 - She just doesn't know which one.\\
40 - Well, that's true.\\
41 - She's getting warmer all the time.\\
42 - Instead of Xavier.\\
43 - Oh... Now, honey.\\
44 - "The real reason I'm writing\\
45 - "is because I went to my club meeting
yesterday.\\
46 - "You remember Flo Pauline Lopis,\\
47 - "the club recording secretary.\\
48 - "Well, it seems that\\
49 - "Flo Pauline's old college roommate,
Ella Scott Porter,\\
50 - "has a cousin who married a man named
Ford\\
51 - and went to live in a little town in
Tennessee."\\
52 - Wake me up when you get to the spicy
stuff.\\
53 - "Well, it seems this cousin has a boy
named Ernest.\\
54 - "She has an older boy named George\\
55 - "and a younger boy named Roger.\\
56 - "Ernest is her middle boy.\\
57 - Well, to make a long story short..."\\
58 - It's too late.\\
59 - "To make a long story short,\\
60 - "Ernest is on his way to New York,\\
61 - "and I told Flo Pauline\\
62 - "to tell Ella to tell her cousin to
tell Ernest\\
63 - that you'd be glad to entertain him."\\
64 - Wait a minute. Wait a minute.\\
65 - She just caught my interest.\\
66 - Uh, "of course I don't know Ernest
personally,\\
67 - "but any friend of Flo Pauline's
roommate's cousin\\
68 - "is a friend of mine.\\
69 - Love, mother."\\
70 - Now, look, you write to your mother
right away\\
71 - and you tell her that we're going out
of town.\\
72 - Oh, honey, sh-she says he's on his
way.\\
73 - There isn't time to write her.\\
74 - Oh, great.\\
75 - Another visitor.
Just what I needed!\\
76 - That makes three of them this month.\\
77 - What's the matter, doesn't anybody
ever stay home anymore?\\
78 - Now, honey, it won't hurt us to be
nice to him.\\
79 - After all, it's my mother's\\
80 - friend's roommate's cousin's middle
boy.\\
81 - Oh, I didn't realize that.\\
82 - That's different.\\
83 - Now, now, honey, will you be nice to
him?\\
84 - Look, I'll tell you what I'll do.\\
85 - I'll take him out to dinner once,\\
86 - and I'll have him down at the club as
my guest... once,\\
87 - and that's the end of it.\\
88 - Well, that's fine.\\
89 - I think Mother would be very happy
about that.\\
90 - There you are.\\
91 - And that's 12, 14, 15.\\
92 - 15 double.\\
93 - "L-u-c-k-e-l."\\
94 - "Luckel."\\
95 - Luckel?
That's not a word.\\
96 - It is, too!\\
97 - Well, I never heard it.
Use it in a sentence.\\
98 - Well, like, uh...\\
99 - when you take a ride in a Fifth
Avenue bus,\\
100 - you can either take the 'spress or
the luckel.\\
101 - That is "local."\\
102 - That's what I said, luckel.\\
103 - And for your information, it's
spelled l-o-c-a-l.\\
104 - Now take that back.\\
105 - Wait till I get you in a jai alai
game.\\
106 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
107 - (doorbell buzzing Luckel.\\
108 - Who's that?\\
109 - I don't know.\\
110 - Howdy, folks.\\
111 - How do you do?\\
112 - I'm Ernest Ford.\\
113 - I'm looking for the Rickerdos.\\
114 - LUCY: Well, uh...\\
115 - Uh, we're the Ricardos.\\
116 - Come in.\\
117 - You must be Cousin Lucy.\\
118 - And there's Cousin Ricky, too.\\
119 - How are you?\\
120 - How are you?\\
121 - Did you say "cousin"?\\
122 - Oh, yeah.
It's just a habit.\\
123 - Down in Tennessee, everybody calls
everybody else "cousin."\\
124 - Oh.\\
125 - 'Course down in Tennessee,\\
126 - everybody is everybody else's cousin.\\
127 - Well, I'm glad...
glad to meet you.\\
128 - Oh, I'm tired.\\
129 - Well, you must be, coming all that
distance.\\
130 - When did you get in?\\
131 - Well, the bus got here at noon,\\
132 - and I've been a-tryin' to find your
place.\\
133 - It took you eight hours to get here?\\
134 - We only live ten minutes from the bus
depot.\\
135 - Not the way I come.\\
136 - What do you mean?\\
137 - Well, down on the street,\\
138 - I asked a fella how to get to the
Rickerdos'.\\
139 - Well, he said, "Take the subway."\\
140 - LUCY: Uh-huh.\\
141 - Well, he pointed over there to a hole
in the ground\\
142 - with some steps a-going down in it.\\
143 - Mm-hmm.
I went down in there,\\
144 - and do you know what I saw?\\
145 - What?\\
146 - Nothing.\\
147 - A bunch of people a-standing there
looking in a ditch.\\
148 - Well, that was the subway.\\
149 - Oh. Well, here come two streetcars
hooked up together.\\
150 - Uh-huh.\\
151 - And I turned around to ask the fella
how to get here\\
152 - and, boy, somebody let the gap down
then.\\
153 - All that bunch of people come
a-steamin' up there\\
154 - pushed me through that door, shut it
up,\\
155 - and we took off like a scalded
gander.\\
156 - Well, what happened then?\\
157 - Well, sir, we drove and drove and
drove\\
158 - and do you know what?
What?\\
159 - That driver never got that thing out
of that hole.\\
160 - Well, now...
it wasn't so funny.\\
161 - We stopped once and they opened that
door\\
162 - and I caught a little daylight in my
eye\\
163 - and I shot out of there like a burnt
rabbit\\
164 - and I got up on top of the ground
again\\
165 - and I was in some place called Long
Island\\
166 - and I walked here.\\
167 - You walked all the way from Long
Island?\\
168 - Yep. Ding-donged if it ain't.\\
169 - What?\\
170 - A long island.\\
171 - Well, you must be tired.\\

Nashville.\\

193 - Well, I'll declare.\\
194 - Do you know what time it is?\\
195 - It's after 9:00.\\
196 - I ought to have been in bed an hour
ago.\\
197 - Oh, well, we sure don't want to keep

199 - as soon as you got in town.\\
200 - Where do I sleep?\\
201 - Uh... where do you sleep?\\
202 - Yeah. Now, now, don't you put

213 - Well, uh, you couldn't sleep here.\\

215 - Oh, no, this is the cat's pole here.\\
216 - Just give me a little kivver and I'll
be as comfy\\
217 - as a wet dog behind the kitchen
stove.\\
218 - Oh, well, you... you really can't
sleep here, Ernie.\\
219 - Uh, Fred, do you still have that
rollaway bed?\\
220 - Sure.\\
221 - Now, wait a minute.\\
222 - I don't want to lay down on anything
that's gonna be\\
223 - a-gallavantin' around the room all
night.\\
224 - Well, no, you-you don't understand,
Ernie.\\
225 - You see, they call it a rollaway bed\\
226 - because you can roll it away in the
closet.\\

373 - like I was wanted and that I
belonged.\\

groceries yesterday?\\
380 - I buy a big load of groceries every
day\\
381 - since the bottomless pit arrived.\\

383 - No. He's up on the roof till the noon
whistle.\\
384 - Up on the roof?\\
385 - Yeah. I think he's getting a suntan.\\
386 - The tactful way he put it was:\\
387 - "I ain't aiming to get as fish-belly
white as you 'uns."\\
388 - I just love the way he talks.\\
389 - Well, he is cute, but oh, gee...\\
390 - RICKY: Lucy!\\
391 - Yes, dear?\\
392 - What happened to these?\\
393 - What's the matter with them?\\
394 - What's the matter with them?
They don't make no noise!\\
395 - I was rehearsing with them.\\
396 - I thought I was going deaf!\\
397 - Who did it?!\\
398 - Ernie. He was only trying to help.\\
399 - Help?!\\
400 - Well, he thought they were broken\\
401 - because they rattled inside.\\
402 - Ay, dios mio!
Dios mio, que estupido!\\
403 - My grandfather gave me these maracas\\
404 - when I was ten years old!\\
405 - I know, dear.\\
406 - Well, that does it.
Out he goes.\\
407 - Now, Ricky...\\

414 - Oh, now, Ricky...\\

427 - Would you look this over\\
428 - and get the spelling bloopers before
I mail it?\\
429 - Sure.\\
430 - Not that mama can read,\\
431 - but I just don't want her to be
embarrassed\\
432 - if she finds somebody to read it to
her.\\
433 - Mm-hmm.\\
434 - Uh, Ernie?\\
435 - Yeah?\\
436 - Wou-Would you run down to the corner
mailbox\\
437 - and, and look and see what time they
pick up the mail?\\
438 - All righty.\\
439 - We want to make sure\\
440 - that we get your mama's letter off on
time.\\
441 - That's a good idea.\\
442 - Listen to the jingle...\\
443 - (humming)\\
444 - Where is he?\\
445 - I sent him down to the corner.\\
446 - What's the matter with you?\\
447 - You know I want to talk to him.\\

with him?\\

475 - What are we going to do?\\
476 - I don't know.\\
477 - Hey. I got an idea.\\
478 - Well, I'm so desperate that I'd like
to hear it.\\

Ernie leave\\
480 - is a real, live, painted-up, wicked
city woman.\\

city woman"?\\
482 - Yeah.\\
483 - She came down from Birmingham\\

118 - ju-just as plain as the nose on your
face,\\
119 - was a bus ticket,\\
120 - and do you know whar it was to?\\
121 - Whar?\\
122 - Bent Fork!\\
123 - All the way thar?\\
124 - Yes, sirree, Bob.\\
125 - Ain't that a coinkidinky?\\
126 - Well, imagine, a bus ticket to Bent
Fork!\\
127 - Imagine that. I bet it made you happy
finding it, huh?\\
128 - Yeah, it did at first, but...\\
129 - I got to thinking of the poor critter
that lost it.\\
130 - I said to myself,\\
131 - somewhere, somebody ain't a-goin' to
Bent Fork.\\
132 - Ernie, where is the ticket?\\
133 - Yeah, where's the ticket, Ernie?\\
134 - Well, that's the best part of it.\\
135 - I run down on the street,\\
136 - and the very first fella I seen\\
137 - was the fella that lost the ticket.\\
138 - You mean you...?\\
139 - Yup. There he was in a old, poor,
raggedy suit\\
140 - and he looked so poorly\\
141 - and I could tell he could ill afford
such a loss.\\
142 - My, the tears of joy run down his
face\\
143 - when I give him his ticket.\\
144 - Ain't it wonderful how a story like
that turns out?\\
145 - Why, looky there.\\
146 - Cousin Ricky's got tears of joy\\
147 - running down his face now.\\
148 - Yes, well, would it be possible for
you to pick it up\\
149 - and fix it and get it back\\
150 - before my husband gets home tonight?\\
151 - Well, I'd certainly appreciate it.\\
152 - Thank you very much.\\
153 - Lucy, did you hear that explosion a
few minutes ago?\\
154 - Indeed I did. It came from our living
room.\\
155 - It did?! What happened?\\
156 - Well, cock your pistol, Ethel.\\
157 - You're not gonna believe this.\\
158 - Did you ever watch\\
159 - Millikan's Chicken-Mash Hour on
television?\\
160 - No.\\
161 - Well, there's a man named Lester Byck\\
162 - who is master of ceremonies\\
163 - on Millikan's Chicken-Mash Hour\\
164 - and he also comes from Bent Fork,
Tennessee.\\
165 - Yeah, well, go on.
What happened?\\
166 - Well, Ernie was watching television,\\
167 - Lester Byck came on\\
168 - and Ernie jumped up and hollered,\\
169 - "Well, I'll be ding-danged if it
ain't Cousin Lester!\\
170 - Hiya, Cousin Lester!"\\
171 - And he ran over and clapped him on
the back--\\
172 - on the tube, I should say.\\
173 - No.\\
174 - Yes, and the whole set exploded.\\
175 - (gasps)\\
176 - Oh, my goodness.\\
177 - You are just in time to help me clean
up.\\
178 - Come, girl.\\
179 - Oh, Lucy!\\
180 - Oh, my goodness.\\
181 - Well, how's Cousin Ernie? Is he hurt?\\
182 - Don't be silly.\\
183 - He's on his way down to the
television station\\
184 - to tell Cousin Lester he's sorry he
hit him so hard.\\
185 - Now, that boy has got to go.\\
186 - There must be some way to get rid of
him.\\
187 - Oh, if he just wasn't so darn nice...\\
188 - As much as I want to get rid of him,\\
189 - I-I just couldn't hurt him.\\
190 - Oh...\\
191 - Why don't you get him a job?\\
192 - Oh, we thought of that, but there's
only one thing he can do\\
193 - and there's not much demand for a
professional eater.\\
194 - By the time I get that set paid for,\\
195 - I'm not going to be able to keep him
in groceries.\\
196 - The food that that boy can put away,
honestly...\\
197 - Hey, that ought to do it!\\
198 - What?\\
199 - I have a notion\\
200 - that when the food goes, so will
Cousin Ernie.\\
201 - Of course!\\
202 - I'll tell him we're broke.	 
Yeah.\\
203 - I'll, I'll tell him that Ricky lost
his job.\\
204 - Yeah!\\
205 - Will you help me?
Sure!\\
206 - Listen, here's what I want Fred and
you to do.\\
207 - From the great Atlantic Ocean to the
wide Pacific shore\\
208 - To the green old flowin' mountains\\
209 - To the south bell by the moor\\
210 - She's mighty tall and handsome\\
211 - She's known quite well by all\\
212 - She's a combination called the Wabash
Cannonball\\
213 - Listen to the jingle, the rumble and
the roar...\\
214 - Cousin Lucy!\\
215 - LUCY: Yup!\\
216 - Is breakfast about ready?\\
217 - Cousin Lucy, them clothes you're
a-wearin'...\\
218 - Oh, you noticed them.\\
219 - I couldn't help it.\\
220 - That sweater...\\
221 - You remind me of my grandma.\\
222 - Oh.\\
223 - Uh, Ernie, about breakfast...\\
224 - Is it ready?\\
225 - Um... look, Ernie,\\
226 - you know you're welcome to anything
we've got, but, uh...\\
227 - Come in the kitchen.\\
228 - Somebody around here has been acting
a hog.\\
229 - No, it's worse than that, Ernie. Sit
down.\\
230 - There's your breakfast and lunch.\\
231 - Breakfast and lunch?\\
232 - Chew it slowly.\\
233 - It'll last longer.\\
234 - Go ahead. It ain't bad.\\
235 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
236 - Will you see who's at the door,
Ernie?\\
237 - Uh-huh.\\
238 - Hello, Ernie. Is Lucy home?\\
239 - Yeah, yeah.\\
240 - Cousin Lucy!\\
241 - Hello.\\
242 - Company's dropped in!\\
243 - Hello, Ethel.\\
244 - You poor little thing.\\
245 - We brought you some food.\\
246 - Oh! Thank you.\\
247 - Thank you!\\
248 - It's all right.\\
249 - Bread. Flour. Milk.\\
250 - You saved my baby's life.\\
251 - Oh, thank you.
Thank you.\\
252 - Oh, thank you.\\
253 - And I brought you an old dress of
mine, darling.\\
254 - Oh, you're so good to me.\\
255 - Oh, it's beautiful!\\
256 - Oh, thank you. Thank you.\\
257 - Well, it's the least we could do,\\
258 - considering we got to kick you out of
your apartment.\\
259 - We hate to do it,\\
260 - but you're six months behind on the
rent\\
261 - and since we	 I know, heard
that...    please, please,\\
262 - Let's not talk in front of company.\\
263 - Cousin Ernie doesn't know that Ricky
lost his j-o-b.\\
264 - Now, darling, you know you can count
on us for help.\\
265 - I know.\\
266 - You're real, true friends.\\
267 - Thank you.\\
268 - Come, Fred.\\
269 - Yeah.\\
270 - Bye.
Bye.\\
271 - Ah... Cousin Lucy...\\
272 - Yes, Cousin Ernie?\\
273 - I don't want to be a nosey Parker,\\
274 - and, uh, I don't understand this
j-o-b,\\
275 - but I think there's something wrong
around here.\\
276 - Whatever makes you think that?\\
277 - (laughs)\\
278 - You've got to get up pretty early in
the morning\\
279 - to fool old Ernie.\\
280 - I think there's a polecat in the
henhouse.\\
281 - Well, I guess we can't keep it from
you any longer.\\
282 - You're right, Ernie.\\
283 - Something is wrong.\\
284 - Mighty wrong.\\
285 - Mighty wrong.\\
286 - We're broke.\\
287 - Ricky's lost his job.\\
288 - We're penniless.\\
289 - Now, now, now, Cousin Lucy,\\
290 - don't you go and take on like that.\\
291 - Now, now, now, now, now.\\
292 - Oh, I don't mind for myself.\\
293 - I don't mind not having anything to
eat,\\
294 - not having anyplace to live,\\
295 - but the bitterest pill of all\\
296 - is not being able to afford you with
us anymore.\\
297 - Oh, what the hen feathers.\\
298 - That's nothing to cry about.\\
299 - Look, I'll just hightail it right on
back to Bent Fork.\\
300 - Well, maybe that would be best,
Ernie.\\
301 - Well, I'll go pack my other shirt.\\
302 - Mama always said I had a lot of
get-up-and-go,\\
303 - so I'll just get up and go.\\
304 - Lucy?\\
305 - LUCY: Yeah?\\
306 - Hi.\\
307 - ETHEL: Hasn't he gone yet?\\
308 - Sure. He left an hour ago with his
suitcase in his hand,\\
309 - his hat on his head and a lump in his
throat.\\
310 - Why are you still in those clothes?\\
311 - Oh, I just wanted Ricky to see how I
look.\\
312 - (laughing): Oh.\\
313 - Well, then you won't need our
rollaway bed anymore.\\
314 - No, I won't, Fred.
Thank you very much.\\
315 - Let's get it out of her way.
Yeah.\\
316 - I'd appreciate it.
It's a might handy thing\\
317 - to have around, though, I can tell
you that.\\
318 - FRED: Here we go.\\
319 - Okay.\\
320 - Ernie!\\
321 - Yep, it's me. Cousin Fred, you might
as well\\
322 - put that runaway bed back where you
got it.\\
323 - I'm a-stayin'.\\
324 - But, Ernie, I told you, we're broke.\\
325 - They're wiped out.\\
326 - I know it. That's why I'm a-stayin'.\\
327 - Cousin Lucy, I ain't a-leavin' you in
your time of need.\\
328 - I got as fer as the corner\\
329 - and I stopped dead in my tracks.\\
330 - It hit me like a Hickory Ball.\\
331 - I said to myself "You're a rat
a-leavin' a sinking ship."\\
332 - Oh, now, Ernie, you shouldn't feel
like that.\\
333 - You just go on home.
We'll manage.\\
334 - Sure. We'll help 'em.\\
335 - You can keep the apartment for
another month.\\
336 - You can go ahead home.\\
337 - Yeah.\\
338 - Now you all hush up.\\
339 - I stayed with you while you was
eatin' high on the hog\\
340 - and I'm gonna stick to you\\
341 - while you're down around the hocks.\\
342 - Oh, Ernie, really, if I could...\\
343 - Hi.
BOTH: Hi, Rick.\\
344 - Hi, Cousin!\\
345 - Hi, amigo.\\
346 - What's the matter with you?\\
347 - Uh, I-I-I was just telling Ernie how
we were broke\\
348 - and we couldn't afford to keep him
here any longer\\
349 - and-and the reason that we were...\\
350 - What do you mean, "broke"?\\
351 - Now, don't you go puttin' on none\\
352 - for me there, Cousin Ricky.\\
353 - Cousin Lucy told me\\
354 - all about you losing your j-o-b.\\
355 - What?!\\
356 - That's right.\\
357 - And-and now's when you need a real
friend,\\
358 - and I ain't the only friend you've
got neither.\\
359 - What do you mean, Ernie?\\
360 - Well, so on the way back up here,\\
361 - I stopped down at the grocery store,\\
362 - and the fella there was that amazed\\
363 - when I told him you'd been picked
cleaner\\
364 - than a hound's tooth.\\
365 - You told the grocery man that we were
broke?\\
366 - Yep, and look what he give me.\\
367 - Oh, scoot over there.\\
368 - This is just gonna tickle you to
death.\\
369 - Oh, I'll tell you, he's the nicest
fella.\\
370 - Here, now, there's some day-old
bread.\\
371 - Here's some of the canned goods\\
372 - that, uh, that lost the labels off
them, you know.\\
373 - Uh... Ernie, the Ricardos don't,
uh...\\
374 - They don't want anybody to know
they're broke.\\
375 - Aah! I never took no stock\\
376 - in foolish pride.\\
377 - Now, down home, when folks got into
trouble,\\
378 - the neighbors all pitched in and
helped,\\
379 - and I'm happy to report\\
380 - that your neighbors here in New York\\
381 - are just as friendly as they are in
Tennessee.\\
382 - Why do you say that, Ernie?\\
383 - I took up a collection\\
384 - of all your neighbors here in this
apartment.\\
385 - Oh, no.\\
386 - Oh, yeah.\\
387 - And look-it here.\\
388 - We didn't do bad, neither.\\
389 - Look-it there.\\
390 - Isn't that wonderful?\\
391 - You know, when folks get hard up,\\
392 - it's just wonderful how people...\\
393 - Hi.\\
394 - Hi. How'd everything go?\\
395 - All right.
How's the baby?\\
396 - Haven't heard a peep out of him.\\
397 - Ricky come back yet?\\
398 - No.\\
399 - I have never seen him so mad.\\
400 - Neither have I.\\
401 - He just started to shake and walked
out of the door.\\
402 - He didn't say a word to you, I wonder
why.\\
403 - He was afraid.\\
404 - Afraid of what?\\
405 - Afraid he might kill me.\\
406 - Where's Ernie?\\
407 - I don't know. He just said, "I got an
idea," and left.\\
408 - Well, everybody took their money back\\
409 - and I got 42 cents left over.\\
410 - Ah!\\
411 - I'll bet that belonged to Ernie.\\
412 - That's all the money he had left in
the world.\\
413 - Aw...\\
414 - Oh, dear.\\
415 - If I wasn't so sick and tired of him,
I-I'd like him.\\
416 - Well, how are you gonna get rid of
him now?\\
417 - I'm not even gonna try.\\
418 - I give up.\\
419 - Oh, Lucy, he'll stay here forever.\\
420 - Well, we'll get used to him through
the years.\\
421 - Who knows? Someday we may even adopt
him.\\
422 - (laughing): Oh...\\
423 - I got to go put my roast on.\\
424 - If you need any help when Ricky
comes, just yell.\\
425 - All right, dear.\\
426 - (whispering): Here comes Ricky.\\
427 - Hi.\\
428 - Hi, Ethel.\\
429 - Is that a smile?\\
430 - Yeah.\\
431 - Oh.\\
432 - Well, you know, I got to thinking
about it, and...\\
433 - (chuckles)\\
434 - I just can't get mad at that guy.\\
435 - That's right, honey.\\
436 - ETHEL: Sure.\\
437 - He is so sweet and so nice.\\
438 - Yeah.			Yeah.\\
439 - Imagine him taking up a collection
for us.\\
440 - How about that?\\
441 - Well, honey, I guess we'll just have
to figure out\\
442 - a way to get rid of him without
hurting his feelings.\\
443 - That's right, honey.\\
444 - I just can't do it.\\
445 - No.\\
446 - ERNIE: Cousin Lucy!
Cousin Lucy!\\
447 - (sighs)\\
448 - Here comes my oldest boy.\\
449 - Cousin Lucy, your troubles is all
over.\\
450 - We'uns is a-going on Millikan's
Chicken-Mash Hour.\\
451 - Who is "we'uns"?\\
452 - Well, me and you and Cousin Ricky\\
453 - and Cousin Ethel and Cousin Fred.\\
454 - Now, wait. Just, just count me'uns
out of you all's we'uns.\\
455 - Well, now, don't say the preserves is
spoilt\\
456 - till you've took the lid off the jar.\\
457 - What's he mean by that?\\
458 - I don't know, but keep the lid on
that jar.\\
459 - But can't you see that this fixes
everything?\\
460 - They'll pay $200 for one appearance\\
461 - of Ernest Ford and his four hot
chicken pickers.\\
462 - "Hot chicken pickers"?\\
463 - Yeah.
Oh, no, no, no.\\
464 - Look, Ernie, Ernie.\\
465 - Really, we don't need the money.
Really, we don't.\\
466 - Now, as the whale said\\
467 - when he seen Jonah standing on the
bank,\\
468 - "I ain't a-swallerin' that."\\
469 - Look, Ernie, that's...\\
470 - It's, it's, it's very nice of you,\\
471 - but we-we ain't the, uh, hot chicken
pickin' type.\\
472 - Then I guess I'll never get back to
Bent Fork.\\
473 - Why not?\\
474 - Well, you see, with that $200,\\
475 - that'll pay my bus fare back to Bent
Fork.\\
476 - Then I'll have about 175 left\\
477 - and that ought to do you all about,
oh, six months or so.\\
478 - But... if you don't cotton to the
idea,\\
479 - I reckon I'll just have to set around
here\\
480 - till I think of something better.\\
481 - Ernie...\\
482 - Hmm?\\
483 - You mean if we, if we go on this
television show with you,\\
484 - you... you'll be able to go back to
Bent Fork?\\
485 - Right after the last twang of the
guitar,\\
486 - I'll be a-headin' home\\
487 - quicker than a bobcat with a burr
under his tail.\\
488 - Ricky, what do you say?\\
489 - Bring on the hot chickens and let's
start pickin'.\\
490 - And now, friends and neighbors,\\
491 - Millikan's Chicken-Mash Hour is proud
to present\\
492 - for the first time on television,\\
493 - a group that come clean from Bent
Fork, Tennessee,\\
494 - Ernie Ford and his four hot chicken

\subsection {Episode 30: The Golf Game}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Well, the baby's sound asleep.\\
3 - I'll get Mrs. Trumbull.
We can go to the movies.\\
4 - Where are the fellas?\\
5 - Out in the hall.\\
6 - Playing golf again?\\
7 - Yeah. They're practicing chip shots,
whatever they are.\\
8 - Oh, dear. I was hoping we could get
out of here\\
9 - before they started that.\\
10 - Golf, golf, golf-- that's all they
think about anymore.\\
11 - It's all your fault.\\
12 - My fault?\\
13 - Yes. If you hadn't gotten those clubs
for Ricky\\
14 - for his anniversary present,\\
15 - they never would have taken it up.\\
16 - You're right. I wanted to find him a
hobby.\\
17 - If I'd known this was gonna happen,\\
18 - I'd have gotten him an embroidery
set.\\
19 - Well, I'll put an end to this.\\
20 - Fellas!\\
21 - Oh!\\
22 - Watch out what you're doing!\\
23 - Oh, I'm sorry.
What are you trying to do?\\
24 - It's only a Ping-Pong ball.\\
25 - Well, come on now, we're gonna go to
the movies.\\
26 - Well, it'd better be a good picture.\\
27 - Marriage certainly does strange
things to a man.\\
28 - This is the same man who used to say,\\
29 - "Who cares about the picture?\\
30 - Let's just sit in the balcony and
smooch."\\
31 - Never mind.\\
32 - I know just how you feel, Lucy.\\
33 - Oh, now, Ethel.\\
34 - It's true, Fred.
It's been years\\
35 - since we sat in a movie\\
36 - with your arm around my waist.\\
37 - It's been years since my arm reached
around your waist.\\
38 - Oh...\\
39 - Well, let's face it, Ethel.\\
40 - We're not exciting anymore. Golf is.\\
41 - Ah, Honey, it's not that.\\
42 - And we just want to be good, that's
all.\\
43 - Yeah, well, right now we're going to
the movies.\\
44 - Now, put those clubs away.\\
45 - All right.
Rick, tomorrow I'll start working\\
46 - on that back-with-
the-right-hip-first thing.\\
47 - Yeah... what do you mean right hip
first ? Left hip.\\
48 - How can you start back with the left
hip\\
49 - when it's way around here?\\
50 - Oh, now, look, Fred.
Come here, would you?\\
51 - I'll watch.	    Look.
I'll watch.\\
52 - Now, address the ball, right?
Yes.\\
53 - Now your weight is divided evenly,
right?\\
54 - Yes.	    All right, go back now.\\
55 - Ricky.
Fred.
See?\\
56 - Ricky!
Fred!	 Now, there's the...\\
57 - Now, just a minute.
Will you relax?\\
58 - This is very important.\\
59 - That's it. Gin.\\
60 - Oh...\\
61 - What's the score?\\
62 - 15 games for you, 22 for me.\\
63 - FRED: Yeah, I got it now.\\
64 - RICKY: You got it?\\
65 - FRED: I know what you mean now.\\
66 - RICKY: All right.\\
67 - Honestly, this is disgraceful.\\
68 - Gee, it's too bad.\\
69 - It was such a good picture, too.\\
70 - You know, we're gonna have to do
something\\
71 - about this golf business.\\
72 - What do you have in mind?\\
73 - Well, we could fight hobby with
hobby.\\
74 - We could get interested in something\\
75 - and drive them crazy.\\
76 - Good.\\
77 - Now, what'll it be?\\
78 - How about men?\\
79 - I mean a game we can play.\\
80 - Something we can talk about all the
time\\
81 - and practice around the house.\\
82 - Let's see, tennis...
bowling... swimming...?\\
83 - Catch on to your putting grip, see?\\
84 - Well, I don't think that the grip...\\
85 - (whistle blowing)\\
86 - FRED: What...\\
87 - Foul, foul, foul!\\
88 - (whistle blowing)\\
89 - What is this?!\\
90 - It's our new hobby, basketball.\\
91 - (whistle blowing)\\
92 - Jump ball.
All right.\\
93 - (whistle blowing)\\
94 - (whistle blowing)\\
95 - Right over here.\\
96 - Oh, no, you don't!\\
97 - Now, wait a minute.\\
98 - Now, just a minute.\\
99 - If you don't mind,\\
100 - would you tell me what's going on
here?\\
101 - Uh... well, we decided to take up a
sport.\\
102 - Yeah, you know one to occupy all our
time.\\
103 - One that we can practice all day and
talk about all night.\\
104 - Until everybody's bored to tears.\\
105 - Well, I think that that is a splendid
idea.\\
106 - Now that you have your own sport,\\
107 - you will realize why we like golf so
much.\\
108 - That makes it work out perfectly.\\
109 - Sure. Now, let's go over to your
apartment\\
110 - and practice that putting that you
were talking about.\\
111 - All right.\\
112 - So long, bloomer girls.\\
113 - Time-in!\\
114 - Well, the game's over and we lost.\\
115 - Should we turn in our suits and go to
the showers?\\
116 - I guess so.\\
117 - Well, maybe we should have taken up
golf.\\
118 - At least we'd get to see them once in
a while.\\
119 - Yeah.\\
120 - Hey, why not?\\
121 - Why not what?\\
122 - Why not take up golf?\\
123 - Fred and Ricky are just starting to
play.\\
124 - They won't mind us being beginners,
too.\\
125 - Oh, Ethel, I don't know.\\
126 - Oh, now, it's just perfect.\\
127 - There're two of us and two of them.\\
128 - We'll make a...
a foursome.\\
129 - I have an idea this is one time\\
130 - that two and two will not make four.\\
131 - Oh, now, Lucy, I've heard them say
dozens of times\\
132 - how hard it is to get up a foursome.\\
133 - Gee, that's right.\\
134 - We'd really be doing them a favor.\\
135 - Sure we would.\\
136 - All right, I'll go tell them the good
news.\\
137 - All right.
Yeah?\\
138 - Lucy.
Yeah?\\
139 - Where's my golf book?\\
140 - On-on the mantle.
Oh, thank you.\\
141 - Here, Fred.	     Uh, we...\\
142 - We have something Oh?	  to tell
you.\\
143 - Something that's going to surprise
you,\\
144 - please you.
Yeah.\\
145 - We're going to give up basketball.\\
146 - Oh. Here's the rule, Fred.\\
147 - LUCY: We're going to take up golf.\\
148 - Isn't that wonderful?\\
149 - Now you won't have any trouble
getting up a foursome.\\
150 - Well, uh, uh, uh...\\
151 - you-you-you can't play golf with us.\\
152 - No.\\
153 - Why not?\\
154 - Well, uh...\\
155 - Why not, Fred?\\
156 - It's against the law?\\
157 - It is not.\\
158 - Well, uh, uh...\\
159 - Mamie doesn't play.\\
160 - LUCY: Oh...\\
161 - Then it's all settled.\\
162 - We're gonna play golf.\\
163 - Yeah, and you and Fred can teach us.\\
164 - That way, we can play and learn at
the same time.\\
165 - LUCY: Won't that be fun?\\
166 - Hey, Rick, that's a pretty
good-looking swing.\\
167 - Oh, I can hit little pieces of
cellophane\\
168 - and dandelions all day long.\\
169 - You put a ball in front of me, that's
when I freeze up.\\
170 - You'll get...\\
171 - (chuckling)\\
172 - Where are the girls?\\
173 - Oh, you know how they are.\\
174 - Takes them a long time to change
clothes.\\
175 - They're only changing shoes.\\
176 - Yeah, you know something?\\
177 - We might have made a terrible
mistake,\\
178 - teaching our wives how to play golf.\\
179 - Oh, everything will work out all
right, you know.\\
180 - They'll, they'll play with us for a
couple of days.\\
181 - They won't be any good\\
182 - and they'll, they'll get discouraged\\
183 - and they'll quit.
Mmm-hmm.\\
184 - Well, supposing they don't get
discouraged?\\
185 - Supposing they like it real well and
get good at it?\\
186 - Then what are we gonna do?\\
187 - Then we'll kill ourselves.\\
188 - I'm with you.\\
189 - Hey, you know, maybe you're right.\\
190 - Yeah.\\
191 - Maybe they will like it.\\
192 - Uh-huh.\\
193 - Maybe they won't want to quit.\\
194 - Uh-huh.\\
195 - We got to protect ourselves.\\
196 - But how?\\
197 - Well, they don't know anything about
this game, do they?\\
198 - I don't think so.\\
199 - Anything that we tell them, they'll
believe, right?\\
200 - I think so.\\
201 - Well, suppose that we make up a game\\
202 - that is so complicated and so
confusing\\
203 - that they'll want to quit?\\
204 - We can make up our own rules.\\
205 - (chortling): There's an idea!\\
206 - (chuckling): I'll tell you what we're
gonna do.\\
207 - All right.
(Lucy and Ethel whooping)\\
208 - Here they come.
Now, look.\\
209 - Just-just go along with whatever I do
and say,\\
210 - and if you think of something good,
throw it in.\\
211 - I'm with you.		Okay.\\
212 - Hi!
Hi, kids!\\
213 - Hiya.
Hiya.\\
214 - Gee, is it beautiful out here.\\
215 - Isn't it nice?\\
216 - No wonder you want to play golf all
the time.\\
217 - Oh, the air smells so fresh and so
clean out here,\\
218 - I'm gonna like golf.\\
219 - Gee, I'm gonna make a baby- sitting
deal with Mrs. Trumbull,\\
220 - then we can play every day.\\
221 - ETHEL: Sure!\\
222 - Well, let's get started.\\
223 - Uh, yeah. Put your clubs right on
there, honey.\\
224 - Okay.
Get ready now.\\
225 - Put them right on that bench, Ethel.
That's right.\\
226 - Are you ready, everybody?\\
227 - Yeah.
Fred?\\
228 - (grunts)\\
229 - Lucy.\\
230 - What's this for?\\
231 - Ethel.\\
232 - To see who goes first.\\
233 - Oh.\\
234 - Well, Lucy goes first.\\
235 - How do you figure that?\\
236 - Uh... the fourth one down from the
top goes first.\\
237 - Oh.\\
238 - That's right.\\
239 - Well, well, what club do I use?\\
240 - What are you saying?\\
241 - What club do I use?\\
242 - What club? Uh...
let me see now.\\
243 - What club? Um...\\
244 - Uh...\\
245 - I think a stymie would be right,
don't you, Fred?\\
246 - Yeah, unless she wants to use a
niblick.\\
247 - A niblick.\\
248 - That sounds like something you made
up.\\
249 - Huh. I'll use a stymie, dear.\\
250 - RICKY: Good. Good.\\
251 - Which one is it?\\
252 - Uh... that's a stymie right there.\\
253 - Okay.\\
254 - Now don't get		Uh-huh.
in their way.\\
255 - Give her plenty of room now.\\
256 - Give her plenty of room.\\
257 - All right.
Where's the ball?\\
258 - Oh, honey... honey,\\
259 - if you don't know how to hold the
club,\\
260 - why didn't you ask me?\\
261 - Oh, well, I...\\
262 - That's what we're here for-- to teach
you.\\
263 - Well, I didn't want to appear too
ignorant.\\
264 - Oh, that's all right, honey.\\
265 - You'll be doing all right.\\
266 - Now, look, I'll show you.\\
267 - See, put your club right here, like
this.\\
268 - Now get your hands here.\\
269 - Now, interlock all your fingers like
that, see?\\
270 - Now, fold your thumbs under.\\
271 - Now, go ahead and grip the club.\\
272 - That's right.\\
273 - Huh?\\
274 - Ninth grip, yes.\\
275 - Feels kind of uncomfortable.\\
276 - You sure it's right?\\
277 - Well, it's uncomfortable for
everybody at first,\\
278 - but you'll get used to it.	
Sure, yeah.\\
279 - Okay, where's the ball?\\
280 - Oh, yes, I'll get your ball. Here.\\
281 - Oh, Fred, I don't have any divots.\\
282 - Have you got a divot with you?\\
283 - Oh, is that what a divot is?
That's a divot,\\
284 - yeah.
Oh.\\
285 - Now, there you go.\\
286 - There. Like so.\\
287 - Now, go ahead.\\
288 - Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!\\
289 - What's the matter?\\
290 - She forgot to say "May I?"\\
291 - Oh.\\
292 - I didn't know.\\
293 - Well, now, look, honey,\\
294 - as long as you're going to play the
game,\\
295 - you might as well learn it correctly\\
296 - from the very beginning.\\
297 - Yeah, I want to learn the right way.\\
298 - All right, now, when you forget to
say "may I",\\
299 - before you hit the ball, it's a
penalty.\\
300 - Oh.
You lose ten points\\
301 - and you have to take one giant step
forward\\
302 - with your right leg only.\\
303 - One giant step forward, right-right
leg only.\\
304 - Right.\\
305 - Now hit the ball.\\
306 - Very good!\\
307 - Was that good?\\
308 - That's her first time out.\\
309 - She'll be a champion.\\
310 - Oh, really?\\
311 - Go ahead, hit it again, honey.\\
312 - Hit it again.
Yes, sir.\\
313 - Hit it again.\\
314 - Oh, I got to get the grip.\\
315 - RICKY: Yeah. Come on.\\
316 - That's getting to look better.\\
317 - One...\\
318 - Now, don't look at the ball, honey.\\
319 - Keep your eyes on the fairway.\\
320 - Don't look at the ball.\\
321 - RICKY: Two. That's good.\\
322 - Three!\\
323 - That's a dormie.\\
324 - A dormie?\\
325 - A dormie, yeah. Now you get to pick
up the ball\\
326 - and throw it down the fairway\\
327 - under your left leg.\\
328 - Oh, that's a cinch.\\
329 - Very good.\\
330 - Oh, that's very good.\\
331 - Now it's your turn, Ethel.\\
332 - My turn. My turn.\\
333 - I'll get your club.\\
334 - Okay.
All right.\\
335 - I hope I'm as good as you were.\\
336 - It's, it's not hard at all, really.\\
337 - Here, I'll show you how...\\
338 - I know how.
I watched her.\\
339 - Oh, excuse me.\\
340 - That's right, that's right. She
knows.\\
341 - That's the grip, yeah.\\
342 - Give me the ball.\\
343 - Oh, yes, I forgot.\\
344 - (grunting): There you are.\\
345 - (chuckling)\\
346 - May I?\\
347 - Yeah.\\
348 - Be my guest.\\
349 - Uh-uh-uh-uh, no, no, no, no, no.\\
350 - What did I do?\\
351 - Why, you can't do a normal stymie\\
352 - after your partner has dormied.\\
353 - ETHEL: Oh, I can't?\\
354 - (grumbling)\\
355 - What's the matter with you?\\
356 - Are you trying to get us thrown off
the golf course?\\
357 - Well, I didn't know.\\
358 - Ricky.\\
359 - Yes, sir.\\
360 - Permission to shoot out of turn,
please.\\
361 - Permission granted.\\
362 - Thank you.\\
363 - Let me show you how to make the shot.\\
364 - (imitating bird whistling)\\
365 - What was that?\\
366 - A birdie.\\
367 - Oh!		A birdie.\\
368 - Okay, a birdie.\\
369 - Give me another ball.\\
370 - All right.
Here you are.\\
371 - Birdie. I've heard about birdies.\\
372 - RICKY: Yeah, you heard about it.
That's right.\\
373 - (imitating bird whistling)\\
374 - One, two, three...\\
375 - Kick it, Ethel!
Kick it?!\\
376 - Kick the ball, yeah.
Four, five...\\
377 - If he gets to ten, you're out.\\
378 - Now kick it, kick it.
Oh, I kick it!\\
379 - I kick it!\\
380 - (shouting)\\
381 - She kicked it!\\
382 - Now it's your turn, Rick.\\
383 - My turn?
Yes.\\
384 - What are you talking about?\\
385 - She kicked the ball before I counted
to ten,\\
386 - so I don't get to drive in this hole.\\
387 - Oh, that's right.\\
388 - Now, let's see, uh...\\
389 - Lucy shot first,\\
390 - and her ball went farther down the
fairway\\
391 - than the third player's ball.
Yeah.\\
392 - So, Lucy gets to carry all the bags!\\
393 - FRED: That's right.\\
394 - You mean I won?     Yeah.\\
395 - Yeah.
Oh, wonderful!\\
396 - We'll see you down the fairway.\\
397 - Come on.
Come on.\\
398 - Come on, Ethel.
Hurry up, Lucy.\\
399 - Hurry up, honey.
I am.\\
400 - Hurry up now.\\
401 - Yeah, I will.\\
402 - RICKY: Hurry up!\\
403 - I'm hurrying.\\
404 - They're doing fine, aren't they?\\
405 - I should say they are.\\
406 - Come on, girls, hurry up!\\
407 - They approach very well.\\
408 - I'll say they do.\\
409 - That's it.
That's it.\\
410 - Fine.
That's it.
That's it.\\
411 - LUCY: Oh, well, how did we do?\\
412 - Well, it only took us one hour and a
half\\
413 - to get to the first green.\\
414 - Well, that ought to be some kind of a
record.\\
415 - I would say so, yeah, yeah.\\
416 - Now what do we do?\\
417 - Well, now we all putt our balls into
the little cup here.\\
418 - Yeah.
Oh?\\
419 - Uh-oh!\\
420 - What's the matter?\\
421 - Lucy's ball is not on the green.\\
422 - Oh, is that my ball?\\
423 - Uh-uh-uh-uh!\\
424 - Never, never, never touch your ball\\
425 - unless it's a dormie.\\
426 - Oh, well, I didn't know.\\
427 - Well, I'm sorry, but you get a mashie
for a penalty.\\
428 - What's a mashie?\\
429 - This is a mashie.\\
430 - That's a mashie?\\
431 - That's a mashie, yeah.\\
432 - Now we all putt our balls into the
cup.
All right.\\
433 - Now, here's your putter.
Here's your putter, Ethel.\\
434 - Where's my ball?
There's your ball\\
435 - Right there.
in the corner.\\
436 - Place the flag down here.\\
437 - Rick?\\
438 - Yeah?\\
439 - Do we all go at once?\\
440 - Yeah, yeah, we all go at once.\\
441 - Sure, that's the reason they say\\
442 - this game is so much like hockey.\\
443 - That's right, yeah.\\
444 - Now, you see, uh...\\
445 - the idea of putting here\\
446 - is that you try to get your ball in
the cup\\
447 - and at the same time,\\
448 - you try to keep the other players'
ball\\
449 - from getting into the cup.\\
450 - Okay.
Okay.\\
451 - Now, I'll count to three\\
452 - and we all go.
All right.\\
453 - Are you ready?
Yup.\\
454 - One, two, three.\\
455 - ETHEL (laughing): That's mine. That's
mine.\\
456 - That's mine.\\
457 - Hurry up.\\
458 - I got mine in!
I got mine in!\\
459 - I got mine in!
I got mine in!\\
460 - Well, that's wonderful!\\
461 - I told you she'd be a champ.\\
462 - Yeah.
Do I win?\\
463 - Yes, sir! So you get to carry all the
bags again.\\
464 - We'll see you at the next tee.\\
465 - FRED: Hurry up, now, Lucy.\\
466 - RICKY: Hurry up.\\
467 - I won.\\
468 - Come on, girl, come on.\\
469 - Up in the air, up in the air.\\
470 - That's enough.\\
471 - Gee, that's some penalty\\
472 - just because I hit my ball farther
than Fred did.\\
473 - We told them we wanted to learn to
play right.\\
474 - What are you complaining about?\\
475 - I had to carry the bags.\\
476 - I wonder where the fellows are.\\
477 - I haven't seen them since Fred hit
his ball into the woods.\\
478 - (sighs)\\
479 - Well, how many strokes did you take
on that hole?\\
480 - Six.\\
481 - Lucy.\\
482 - Well, 26.\\
483 - What's the difference?\\
484 - How many did you take?\\
485 - Thirty.
Yeah.\\
486 - I'll just put down seven for each of
us.\\
487 - I wonder what the penalty is for
that.\\
488 - I think while I'm waiting, I'll
practice that stroke\\
489 - Ricky was ready to teach me.\\
490 - Which one?\\
491 - You know, the one that you use\\
492 - when you're between 47 and 63 yards
from the green.\\
493 - The "hop, skip and a jump" shot.\\
494 - (groaning)\\
495 - This grip's beginning to feel a lot
better.\\
496 - Hello.\\
497 - Hi.\\
498 - Hello.\\
499 - Uh, you mind if I go through?\\
500 - Go through what?\\
501 - Well, I was, uh, behind you and
playing by myself and, uh...\\
502 - Oh, you want to join us. Oh, sure.\\
503 - I'm Lucy Ricardo and this is Ethel
Mertz.\\
504 - What's your name?\\
505 - I'm Jimmy Demaret.\\
506 - Jimmy Demaret?!\\
507 - Jimmy Demaret?!\\
508 - Oh, for heaven's sake,\\
509 - we've heard so much about you.\\
510 - Listen, we're just, ju-just learning.\\
511 - You sure you won't mind playing with
us?\\
512 - Oh, uh, not at all.\\
513 - Oh, well, fine, then.\\
514 - Let's get started.\\
515 - Let's see who goes first.\\
516 - Oh, uh, ladies always first.\\
517 - Oh, no, no. We have to choose up.\\
518 - Here you are, Jim.\\
519 - Come on.\\
520 - You go first, Jim.\\
521 - You're second from the top.\\
522 - Uh-uh-uh.\\
523 - You didn't say, "May I?"\\
524 - "May I?"\\
525 - Too late now.\\
526 - That'll cost you ten points.\\
527 - Yeah, with all of your experience,\\
528 - I'm surprised at you.\\
529 - Well, go ahead.\\
530 - Well, that was pretty dull.\\
531 - What was that? Stand there and hit
the ball--\\
532 - anybody could do that.\\
533 - I thought at least\\
534 - you were gonna use an
over-the-shoulder,\\
535 - left-handed whirling stymie, didn't
you?\\
536 - Well...\\
537 - Hey... you lost another ten points.\\
538 - Your ball missed the sand trap
completely\\
539 - and landed right on the green.	     
   Yeah.\\
540 - Hey, uh, better luck next time.\\
541 - You show him how to do it, Lucy.\\
542 - Okay.\\
543 - Dormie! Dormie! Dormie!\\
544 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, dormie, dormie.\\
545 - (laughing)\\
546 - Boy, you're getting good.\\
547 - Okay.\\
548 - Don't you think she's wonderful?\\
549 - She just learned how to play today.\\
550 - Ladies, are you sure you're playing
golf?\\
551 - Sure.\\
552 - Sure.\\
553 - Well, who taught you to play like
that?\\
554 - Our husbands taught us.\\
555 - Yeah.\\
556 - You mean this "choose upside" and
"may I"\\
557 - and "hop, skip and a jump" business?\\
558 - Yeah. Isn't that the way you play?\\
559 - Well, uh... not exactly.\\
560 - Well, for heaven's sake.\\
561 - There's a rotten Cuban in Denmark.\\
562 - And he's got a fat friend.\\
563 - What a dirty trick.\\
564 - Would I like to get even with them.\\
565 - Oh, I can see us playing leapfrog up
there.\\
566 - No wonder they...     No wonder...\\
567 - Oh...\\
568 - A hundred people watching us!\\
569 - Oh, Lucy.\\
570 - I know how we can get even with them.\\
571 - They're in that big tournament
tomorrow.\\
572 - That's our big chance.\\
573 - Yeah?\\
574 - Jimmy, will you help us?\\
575 - May I?\\
576 - You certainly may.\\
577 - Here's what we...\\
578 - Ladies and gentlemen, the next
threesome on the tee\\
579 - will be amateurs Ricky Ricardo and
Fred Mertz of New York City,\\
580 - and from the Concord Hotel at Lake
Kiamesha, New York,\\
581 - three times winner of the Masters\\
582 - at Augusta, Georgia, Jimmy Demaret.\\
583 - (applause)\\
584 - Did you hear who we're playing with?\\
585 - Boy, did I-- Jimmy Demaret.\\
586 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
587 - I won't be able to play at all in
front of him.\\
588 - Oh, he'll know we're just beginners.\\
589 - He had to start himself, you know.\\
590 - No need in being nervous.\\
591 - Yeah, I guess you're right.\\
592 - I just hope I remember the rules\\
593 - after that silly game we played with
the wives.\\
594 - Yeah. That was kind of nasty, wasn't
it?\\
595 - Now, don't knock it.
At least we got rid of them.\\
596 - Yeah.\\
597 - Isn't that Jimmy Demaret?\\
598 - Yeah. Oh, please, please.\\
599 - Just let me hit the ball.
I don't care where it goes.\\
600 - Just let me hit it.\\
601 - Hello.\\
602 - Hello, Mr. Demaret.\\
603 - I'm Ricky Ricardo, and this is Fred
Mertz.\\
604 - Nice to see you both.
Hi, Jimmy.\\
605 - Sure. A great pleasure\\
606 - and an honor playing with you, sir.\\
607 - Well, it's my pleasure.\\
608 - Thank you.\\
609 - Our caddies are not here yet.\\
610 - They said that there was some, uh...
something...\\
611 - A couple of caddies got sick\\
612 - and they had to replace them.\\
613 - I think these are your caddies coming
here now.\\
614 - RICKY: Oh, I see.\\
615 - What are you doing here?\\
616 - What is this?\\
617 - We're your caddies.\\
618 - Yup.\\
619 - Well, are you all ready?\\
620 - Shall we go?\\
621 - Yup.
Step aside, bud.\\
622 - Got to pick Mr. Ricardo's club.\\
623 - Yeah, this is the one, bub.\\
624 - If you don't mind, I'll use this.\\
625 - Now, Lucy, I don't know what you're
doing,\\
626 - but whatever it is, do it later.\\
627 - You know who we're playing with?\\
628 - Who?\\
629 - Jimmy Demaret.\\
630 - Jimmy Demaret?!\\
631 - (mouthing words)\\
632 - Who's he?\\
633 - Just a minute, chum.\\
634 - Better tell you how to play this
hole.\\
635 - Think you ought to use the old hop,
skip and a jump, huh?\\
636 - No. I think you ought to take three
giant steps\\
637 - and kick the bogie.\\
638 - Ethel, come back here.\\
639 - Mashie!
He touched it.\\
640 - Mashie!\\
641 - You crazy or something?\\
642 - I'm sorry.\\
643 - I'm sorry, Mr. Demaret.\\
644 - (stammering): I-I-I... It's...\\
645 - It's some kind of a joke or
something.\\
646 - I assure you, it will never happen
again.\\
647 - That's all right.
That's all right.\\
648 - Will it, dear?\\
649 - Eh.\\
650 - (fingers snapping)\\
651 - May I?\\
652 - Yay!\\
653 - Attaboy, Jimmy!\\
654 - Why, Jimmy,\\
655 - you were in it all the time.\\
656 - He was in it all the time.\\

\subsection {Episode 31: The Sublease}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Honey, did you call the Mertzes?\\
3 - Yeah. They said they'd be right over.\\
4 - Good.	    (doorbell buzzing)\\
5 - Well, there they are.\\
6 - Wait till you tell them.\\
7 - Hi.
Hi!\\
8 - What did you want to see us about?\\
9 - Yeah. What's going on?\\
10 - We have a big surprise for you.\\
11 - Tell them, honey.\\
12 - Ricky's band has been booked\\
13 - into a big, beautiful summer resort
in Maine\\
14 - for two whole months.\\
15 - Won't that be a wonderful vacation?\\
16 - Oh, boy! Are you and the baby going,
too?\\
17 - Sure.
Yeah.\\
18 - Oh, gee, it must be great to leave
this hot city\\
19 - in the middle of summer and go to a
place like that.\\
20 - Two whole months.\\
21 - Isn't that sheer heaven?\\
22 - Boy, what a deal.\\
23 - RICKY: Isn't that really great?\\
24 - Oh, I don't know what I'll do\\
25 - with you gone for two months.\\
26 - Oh...\\
27 - Well, at least the kitchen door\\
28 - and your tongue will both get a
little rest.\\
29 - ETHEL: Oh, Fred, now, Fred...\\
30 - Gee, I hope the baby doesn't forget
us.\\
31 - Oh, Ethel, don't be silly.\\
32 - Well, they forget awful fast, you
know.\\
33 - LUCY: Well, not in that length of
time.\\
34 - Just think-- you've lived here 12
years.\\
35 - This is the first time we've ever
really been separated.\\
36 - That's right.\\
37 - Yeah, it'll be a little\\
38 - lonesome around here all right.\\
39 - What are you talking about?\\
40 - You coming up to visit us.\\
41 - Huh?
Why, certainly.\\
42 - for two whole months, do you?\\
43 - No, sir. You coming up as our guests.\\
44 - Oh, Ricky, I don't think we could...\\
45 - Now, you're coming up or we're not
going.\\
46 - That's right.\\
47 - Honestly, you're just about\\
48 - the nicest, most unselfish people
I've ever known.\\
49 - Well, why shouldn't we be nice to two
of the sweetest,\\
50 - most wonderful people in the whole
world?\\
51 - ETHEL: Aw...\\
52 - Fred, do you ever have the feeling\\
53 - that you were sitting in the middle
of a hot fudge sundae?\\
54 - Ha, ha, ha!\\
55 - Yeah. They're pretty sticky, aren't
they?\\
56 - Well, you can laugh if you want to,\\
57 - but it's gonna seem awful strange\\
58 - having this apartment empty all
summer.\\
59 - Well, we got another surprise for
you.\\
60 - Yup!\\
61 - This apartment is not going to be
empty all summer.\\
62 - It isn't?\\
63 - No.
Yes, sir.\\
64 - I think that we're gonna be able to
sublet it.\\
65 - Well, good.
Oh, Rick, that's fine.\\
66 - You know, I started thinking about
it,\\
67 - I said, "Gee, it's a pretty tough rap\\
68 - paying 125 bucks a month\\
69 - when we're not gonna be here for a
couple of months.\\
70 - Yeah, and I'd feel guilty taking it
from you.\\
71 - Well, I thought you would, Fred, so I
went to see\\
72 - the real estate agent, you know, Mrs.
Hammond,\\
73 - and she said she's sure she can rent
it for us.\\
74 - Well, that's great. Fine.
Oh, boy, that's really great.\\
75 - As a matter of fact,\\
76 - she said that she could get me $300 a
month for it.\\
77 - $300 a month!\\
78 - Isn't that wonderful...?\\
79 - What's the matter?\\
80 - Fred, what's the matter?\\
81 - Well, you only pay us $125 a month
rent.\\
82 - Now, do you think it's fair for you
to make money\\
83 - on our apartment?\\
84 - Well, Fred, I thought you'd be happy\\
85 - that we could make a little money.\\
86 - Yeah.\\
87 - After all, we got a lease.\\
88 - We're living up to our lease.\\
89 - As long as you get $125 a month, it's
fair.\\
90 - Well, it might be fair, but it's
lousy.\\
91 - Now, wait a minute.\\
92 - Don't make it look like we're wrong.\\
93 - You're getting the best of the deal.\\
94 - What?!\\
95 - What are you talking about?\\
96 - Well, now, suppose that the boot was
on the other hand.\\
97 - How about that?\\
98 - Suppose that-that I could only get
$50 a month.\\
99 - Would you give me $75 back?\\
100 - Of course not.\\
101 - There you are-- our friends.\\
102 - We're losing $75 a month,\\
103 - and they wouldn't\\
104 - help us that much.
Yeah.\\
105 - Oh, now, just a minute.\\
106 - This is an entirely different
proposition.\\
107 - Yeah!\\
108 - Why?\\
109 - Why?\\
110 - Because you're getting $300 a month.\\
111 - Yeah.\\
112 - Well, I'm sorry that you feel that
way about it, old man,\\
113 - but I don't think there's anything
you can do about it.\\
114 - Oh, isn't there?\\
115 - No, sir. We have a lease.\\
116 - The lease says that we have the right
to sublet.\\
117 - Honey, where is the lease?\\
118 - Right here.\\
119 - Thank you.
Pardon me, please.\\
120 - Pardon me.\\
121 - Here it is, dear.\\
122 - Pardon me, please.\\
123 - Thank you.
Here you are.\\
124 - Think you're playing with kids? Hmm!\\
125 - Here it is.\\
126 - "The lessee has the right\\
127 - to sublet the apartment in
question..."\\
128 - The lessee-- that's us,\\
129 - and this is the apartment in
question.\\
130 - Ha-ha!\\
131 - Read on. Read on.\\
132 - "The lessee has the right\\
133 - "to sublet the apartment in question\\
134 - with the... with the approval of the
lessor."\\
135 - And that's us-- Mr.
And Mrs. Fred Lessor.\\
136 - Well, what do you say to that,
Minnehaha?\\
137 - Well, I don't see how that changes
anything.\\
138 - We-well, you certainly have to
approve\\
139 - somebody we bring in here.\\
140 - Oh, we... will?\\
141 - Oh, now, don't tell me that you're
going to turn down\\
142 - everybody that we try to rent this
apartment to, are you?\\
143 - Well, honestly, what a couple of
stinkers!\\
144 - Oh, a few minutes ago, she said we
were\\
145 - the sweetest, most wonderful people.\\
146 - Yeah, let's get out of here, Ethel.\\
147 - Okay.\\
148 - Well, honey...\\
149 - Have a nice time in Maine.\\
150 - Have a nice, hot, sticky summer!\\
151 - No matter how hot it gets, it'll be
sheer heaven\\
152 - so long as you are not here.\\
153 - (door slamming)\\
154 - Oh, hello, Mrs. Hammond.\\
155 - Well, look, Mrs. Hammond,\\
156 - there's no use bringing anybody else
over here\\
157 - to look at the apartment.\\
158 - The Mertzes have turned down the last
six couples.\\
159 - Well, just a minute.\\
160 - Mrs. Hammond, she wants to show the
apartment again.\\
161 - She said she has a very lovely
couple.\\
162 - Why bother? The Mertzes wouldn't even
approve Ike and Mamie.\\
163 - Well, she said she's sure they'll
approve these people.\\
164 - Well, what have we got to lose?\\
165 - Okay. Bring them over, Mrs. Hammond.\\
166 - Thanks. Good-bye.\\
167 - I wonder why she thinks they'll
approve these people.\\
168 - I don't know.
What's the difference?\\
169 - We're leaving tonight anyway.\\
170 - Yeah.
(doorbell buzzing)\\
171 - I'll get it, dear.\\
172 - Oh, Mrs. Hammond!\\
173 - How did you get here so soon?\\
174 - Oh, I was in the neighborhood when I
phoned.\\
175 - Won't you come in?\\
176 - (humming)\\
177 - What are you doing here?\\
178 - Oh, we came over to see if\\
179 - we approve of the couple\\
180 - who are subletting the apartment.\\
181 - Oh. Where are they, Mrs. Hammond?\\
182 - There they are.\\
183 - What?!\\
184 - Fred, do you approve of me?\\
185 - Yes. Ethel, do you approve of me?\\
186 - Yes.\\
187 - We approve of us.\\
188 - Well, really.\\
189 - I don't get it.\\
190 - Mrs. Hammond, what's going on here?\\
191 - Well, I think that the Mertzes\\
192 - are going to sublease your apartment\\
193 - and sub-sublet it to someone else.\\
194 - Oh, they're trying to make us look at
this thing\\
195 - through a sweater.\\
196 - Oh, you mean they're trying\\
197 - to pull the wool over our eyes?\\
198 - Yeah.\\
199 - Well, just forget the whole deal.\\
200 - The... the apartment will just stay
empty\\
201 - for the whole summer.\\
202 - Yeah.
Okay.\\
203 - Okay.
Come on, Fred.\\
204 - Good-bye.\\
205 - Just a minute, please.\\
206 - May I make a suggestion?\\
207 - What?\\
208 - Well, I've rented apartments in this
building\\
209 - for my clients for a long time,\\
210 - and every time I've been here,\\
211 - I've been struck by the wonderful
friendship\\
212 - between you two couples.\\
213 - Well, you're just devoted to each
other.\\
214 - I'll bet you've been best friends for
ten years.\\
215 - Twelve.\\
216 - Yeah.\\
217 - Thirteen.\\
218 - No, it's 12.\\
219 - Well, now, the important thing is\\
220 - that I don't want to see it end,\\
221 - and I don't think you do either.\\
222 - Now, look, here's the idea:\\
223 - You're paying $125 a month for the
apartment,\\
224 - and I know that I can get you $300 a
month,\\
225 - so why don't you let me find you a
nice tenant,\\
226 - and you can split the profit between
you?\\
227 - Okay?\\
228 - Okay?\\
229 - Okay, Fred?\\
230 - Okay.\\
231 - Oh!
(laughing)\\
232 - Oh, I'm so glad.\\
233 - I'm glad that's over.\\
234 - Thank you, Mrs. Hammond.\\
235 - Oh, this would have taken\\
236 - a lot longer without you.
Yeah.\\
237 - I was just trying to protect my
commission.\\
238 - (all laughing)\\
239 - Good-bye. See you.
Thank you, Mrs. Hammond.\\
240 - Good-bye, dear.
Good-bye, Mrs. Hammond.\\
241 - Thank you very much.
Bye.\\
242 - Aw, wasn't that sweet of her?\\
243 - Yeah.			Yeah.\\
244 - Hey, Rick, whatever gave you the idea\\
245 - that you two have been living here 13
years?\\
246 - Yeah, it's only 12.\\
247 - Yeah, it's only 12, dear.\\
248 - Now, wait a minute.\\
249 - We moved here when we got married,\\
250 - and we got married, Lucy was 22 years
old.\\
251 - How old are you now, honey?\\
252 - Oh. How do you like that?\\
253 - We've only lived here six years.\\
254 - Lucy, can I help you?\\
255 - Oh. No, I'm all finished.\\
256 - Come on in.\\
257 - I really only wanted to come over and
talk anyway.\\
258 - I'm so glad we made up.\\
259 - So am I.\\
260 - Wasn't that silly?
It always is.\\
261 - (doorbell buzzing)
Yeah.\\
262 - Oh, Mrs. Hammond, you're back
already?\\
263 - I rented your apartment.\\
264 - No kidding!\\
265 - Really, I did.\\
266 - To a Mr. Beecher for $300.\\
267 - $300!
Oh, $300...\\
268 - Sit down, dear.
Oh, that's great.\\
269 - Wh-Where is he?\\
270 - Well, I phoned him to meet me here.\\
271 - In the meantime, I want to tell you
something about him.\\
272 - What's the matter with him?\\
273 - Nothing, but he-he is really a shy,
little man.\\
274 - He was a witness on a murder trial.\\
275 - He's been in court for months,\\
276 - and his nerves are all shot.\\
277 - Oh...
Mm-hmm.\\
278 - All he wants is a nice, quiet place\\
279 - where no one can find him,\\
280 - where he can rest and get control of
his nerves.\\
281 - Oh, well, he'll like it here.\\
282 - Oh, yes.
(knock at door)\\
283 - Gee, this is fine.\\
284 - Did you hear something?\\
285 - Uh-uh.\\
286 - Thought I heard a knock.\\
287 - (faint knocking)\\
288 - Yeah.\\
289 - Maybe it's Mr. Beecher.\\
290 - All right.\\
291 - Mr. Beecher?\\
292 - Mr. Beecher?\\
293 - Mr. Beecher.\\
294 - Oh, come on in.\\
295 - This is the right place.\\
296 - Now, this is Mrs. Ricardo\\
297 - and Mrs. Mertz\\
298 - and this is Mr. Beecher.\\
299 - How do you do?
How do you do?\\
300 - Mr. Beecher, I've told them\\
301 - that you want a nice, quiet place,\\
302 - and I'm sure that you'll find this
just perfect.\\
303 - I don't hear a thing.\\
304 - Oh, no, it's nice and quiet.\\
305 - Sometimes it's so quiet, I think
everybody else\\
306 - in the apartment house is dead.\\
307 - Uh, what she means, Mr. Beecher,\\
308 - is that this place is always quiet as
a tomb.\\
309 - Uh, wou-wouldn't you like me\\
310 - to show you around, Mr. Beecher?\\
311 - Now, right through here, we have the
kitchen.\\
312 - Now, you see, it's, it's really a
lovely, big kitchen,\\
313 - and there's always plenty of light.\\
314 - Oh, yes, we get the sun here all day
long.\\
315 - (screams in horror)\\
316 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
317 - Uh, M-Mr. Beecher?\\
318 - Mr. Beecher?\\
319 - I'm sorry, sir.
It got away from me.\\
320 - May I see the bedroom?\\
321 - Oh, yes, sir. Right, right in through
there.\\
322 - HAMMOND: Yes, yes, I'll show you.\\
323 - Come right this way with me, Mr.
Beecher.\\
324 - Right through here.\\
325 - That's the way.\\
326 - Come right along.\\
327 - Did you ever see anyone in that
condition?\\
328 - Oh, they must have been awful rough
on him\\
329 - at that murder trial.\\
330 - Yeah. I think he'll make a good
tenant, though, huh?\\
331 - Well, at least he won't give any wild
parties.\\
332 - Not very many anyway.\\
333 - (chuckling)
(chuckling)\\
334 - Mr. Beecher thinks it's perfect.\\
335 - Oh, I'm so glad you like it, sir.\\
336 - Now, Mrs. Ricardo, will you sign the
lease?\\
337 - Certainly.\\
338 - Right there.\\
339 - Right here?
Yes.\\
340 - There.\\
341 - Now, and Mr. Beecher,\\
342 - right under Mrs. Ricardo's signature,
please.\\
343 - Thank you.\\
344 - Uh, Mr. Beecher, when would you like
to move in?\\
345 - As soon as possible.\\
346 - Oh, well, uh, we're leaving tonight.\\
347 - Uh, you can move in right away.\\
348 - I'll take these bags down to the
Mertzes'.\\
349 - Yes, I'll help you.
Okay.\\
350 - Oh, fine. I'll get my things\\
351 - and move in right away.\\
352 - Oh, that's fine.
I sure hope\\
353 - you're going to like it here, sir.\\
354 - Oh, you will.
It's nice and quiet.\\
355 - Yes. Thank you, Mrs. Hammond.\\
356 - Thank you.
Good-bye.\\
357 - Bye.\\
358 - Ethel, Mr. Beecher paid me the whole
two months rent.\\
359 - That's $600.\\
360 - $175 profit for each of us.\\
361 - Less Mrs. Hammond's commission, of
course.\\
362 - Oh, boy!
Where's the baby?\\
363 - I thought you were gonna go get him.\\
364 - Oh, Mrs. Trumbull wanted to keep him
a while longer.\\
365 - She can't bear to say good-bye\\
366 - to him for two whole months.\\
367 - She's so sweet.\\
368 - Yeah.\\
369 - There's Ricky!\\
370 - ETHEL: Ricky, come here!\\
371 - I got something to tell you.\\
372 - Well, I got something to tell you,
too.\\
373 - Oh, well, you go ahead.\\
374 - My agent just got a wire from Maine.\\
375 - The job fell through.
We're not going.\\
376 - Ew...\\
377 - Well, I'm awfully sorry, honey.\\
378 - What do you have to tell me?\\
379 - Eww...!\\
380 - What is it?\\
381 - I just rented our apartment for the
summer.\\
382 - What?!\\
383 - Well, give it back to him.\\
384 - I signed the lease.\\
385 - As a matter of fact, he's all moved
in.\\
386 - Well, he can just all move out.\\
387 - I'm going to talk to him right now.\\
388 - No, now, honey, honey, you can't talk
to him.\\
389 - You haven't seen this man.
He couldn't take it.\\
390 - Well, what are we supposed to do?\\
391 - I don't know.\\
392 - Oh, here he is. Come in, Mr. Beecher,
come in.\\
393 - Oh, Mr. Beecher, this is my husband,
Mr. Ricardo.\\
394 - How do you do?
This is Mr. Beecher.\\
395 - How do you do?\\
396 - M-Mrs. Mertz, I don't wish to seem\\
397 - to be complaining straight off,\\
398 - but th-there's a leak in the sink...\\
399 - Now, look here, Mr. Beecher...
Oh! Oh, no!\\
400 - Let me, dear... let me.\\
401 - Uh, Mr. Beecher, you see,\\
402 - we rented you the apartment for two
months\\
403 - because my husband had a job out of
town.\\
404 - Well, the job was canceled,\\
405 - and we're not leaving.\\
406 - Oh... that's too bad.\\
407 - Yes. Well, you see, um, uh, I knew
you'd understand\\
408 - and we need the apartment, so...\\
409 - No, no.\\
410 - No, no, no. The apartment suits me
perfectly.\\
411 - I've got to have it. I must.\\
412 - I can't go through looking for
another one.\\
413 - Well, now, look here...\\
414 - No! Please, no!\\
415 - No! No! No!\\
416 - No! No! No! No! No!\\
417 - (door slamming)\\
418 - Oh, this character's in great shape.\\
419 - Well, what are we going to do now?\\
420 - We'll just have to go to a hotel, I
guess.\\
421 - Go to a hotel for two months with a
baby?\\
422 - It'll cost a fortune.\\
423 - Oh, I'll bet you could find a nice
apartment\\
424 - right here in this neighborhood.\\
425 - No, Ethel, it's not that easy.\\
426 - They don't like to rent apartments
when you got kids.\\
427 - Oh, you can find one, and until you
do,\\
428 - you can move in here with us.\\
429 - Move in here with you?!\\
430 - Certainly. We can get out the
rollaway bed,\\
431 - and one of you can sleep on it, and
one can sleep on the divan.\\
432 - And we'll bring the crib out here...\\
433 - Well, that's awfully nice of you,
Ethel,\\
434 - but we don't want to\\
435 - crowd you that much.
No, honey.\\
436 - So we're a little crowded.\\
437 - What are friends for?\\
438 - Hi.\\
439 - Hi.\\
440 - Hi, Fred.\\
441 - Hi.\\
442 - (sighs)\\
443 - Ew!\\
444 - FRED: Any luck finding a place?\\
445 - No. The only ones that look decent\\
446 - will take pets but no children.\\
447 - Too bad.\\
448 - I'm so desperate, I'm thinking of
tying feathers\\
449 - on little Ricky and telling them he's
a parrot.\\
450 - I bet I walked 20 miles today.\\
451 - How is the baby, honey?\\
452 - Oh, he was all right, except for a
couple of things\\
453 - like crying all afternoon\\
454 - and spilling his food on the bedroom
rug again.\\
455 - Oh, Ethel, I'm sorry.
He's cutting a tooth.\\
456 - I guess he's a little fussy.\\
457 - Mm.\\
458 - Didn't find an apartment, huh?\\
459 - No.\\
460 - Gee, I never thought when we came
here\\
461 - that we'd be here a whole week.\\
462 - Has it only been a week?\\
463 - Well, thanks.\\
464 - Oh, now, stop picking on Lucy.\\
465 - It isn't her fault.\\
466 - I'm doing the best I can, Fred.\\
467 - She and Ricky are probably just as
sick of us as we are of them.\\
468 - Uh... well, let's face it, honey.\\
469 - This apartment is too small for five
people.\\
470 - Yeah.\\
471 - (baby crying)\\
472 - Oh.\\
473 - Lucy, will you try and keep that baby
quiet?\\
474 - His crying is getting on my nerves.\\
475 - Well, why didn't you say so, Fred?\\
476 - Little Ricky's only crying\\
477 - because he thought you liked it.\\
478 - (crying continues)\\
479 - (door slamming)\\
480 - Isn't she ever coming out of that
bathroom?\\
481 - What do you suppose she's doing in
there?\\
482 - She's taking a bath.\\
483 - She's been in there long enough to
bathe an elephant.\\
484 - Oh, there she is.\\
485 - She didn't drown herself after all.\\
486 - Oh, I'm sorry, Fred.\\
487 - I guess I took a little longer than I
expected.\\
488 - Oh, it's okay.\\
489 - It just gave Ethel and me a chance to
get acquainted.\\
490 - What's the matter with him?\\
491 - Oh, he's all right.\\
492 - He always gets cranky\\
493 - if he has to stay up past his
bedtime.\\
494 - FRED: Just as I thought!
No more hot water.\\
495 - Come on, let's go get the baby's crib\\
496 - and bring him out in the living room
again.\\
497 - I'm sorry about the water.\\
498 - I don't think that tank is big
enough...\\
499 - I know. No, it isn't.\\
500 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
501 - (buzzing insistently)\\
502 - (buzzing insistently)\\
503 - Who's ringing the doorbell at this
hour of the night?\\
504 - Oww!\\
505 - (moaning)\\
506 - (baby crying)\\
507 - I'm sorry.
I forgot my key, Fred.\\
508 - Why is he awake this late?\\
509 - What's the matter?\\
510 - Did you have to forget your key twice
in one week?\\
511 - I'm sorry, Fred.
Told you I was sorry.\\
512 - What's the matter?
Who was that at the door?\\
513 - Oh, it's you.\\
514 - There, honey, now.\\
515 - Lucy, is the baby is gonna cry all
night again tonight?\\
516 - He wouldn't be crying\\
517 - if Fred hadn't come out here and
kicked the crib.\\
518 - Well, I wouldn't have kicked the crib\\
519 - if you didn't put it over in the
middle of the room.\\
520 - Oh, Fred.\\
521 - Oh, come on, Fred.\\
522 - Let's try and get some sleep.\\
523 - All right.\\
524 - Good night.
Come on.\\
525 - Good night.
Good night!\\
526 - Good night.\\
527 - Aw...\\
528 - (sighs)\\
529 - Yes, honey, Mama knows.\\
530 - Yes, well...\\
531 - Poor little...\\
532 - Oh, honey, yes...\\
533 - Dishes, dishes, dishes.\\
534 - Somebody around here is always
eating.\\
535 - I must have done a hundred dishes
today.\\
536 - I am so tired of doing dishes.\\
537 - You know, Ethel, we're not the only
ones\\
538 - that eat around here.\\
539 - I didn't say you were, dear.\\
540 - It's just that everybody eats at
different times.\\
541 - There's one skillet out there\\
542 - that hasn't been cold for a week.\\
543 - Well, I guess there's just one thing
to do.\\
544 - Yeah, but you can't find an
apartment.\\
545 - I meant use paper plates.\\
546 - Oh.\\
547 - Darn that Mr. Beecher.\\
548 - It's all his fault.\\
549 - If he'd just get out.\\
550 - Wait a minute.\\
551 - I'll do it.\\
552 - You don't even know what it is.\\
553 - I don't care what it is.\\
554 - I'll do it if it'll get rid of Mr.
Beecher.\\
555 - Well, look, Mr. Beecher is a nervous
wreck\\
556 - because he witnessed a murder.\\
557 - So?\\
558 - So what if he witnessed another
murder?\\
559 - What if he saw me kill you?\\
560 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
561 - Oh, well, what if he saw you kill me?\\
562 - It doesn't make any difference.\\
563 - That's more like it.\\
564 - All right. We'll pretend that you're
mad at me...\\
565 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
566 - Who's there?\\
567 - Mrs. Ricardo.\\
568 - Oh, hello, Mr. Beecher.\\
569 - I just dropped over to see how things
were.\\
570 - Oh, just fine.\\
571 - This place is so nice and quiet and
restful,\\
572 - my nerves are getting back in shape
at last.\\
573 - Well, I'm glad to hear that.\\
574 - Oh, did we leave these here?\\
575 - Oh, yes, yes. I was going to return
them to you.\\
576 - Well, I'll be glad...\\
577 - There you are, you heel!\\
578 - (screaming)\\
579 - You made eyes at my husband for the
last time.\\
580 - What are you talking about?\\
581 - You know what I'm talking about.\\
582 - All right, Ethel, let's face it.\\
583 - You've lost him.\\
584 - He's mine.\\
585 - If I can't have him, you can't have
him either.\\
586 - Are you threatening me?\\
587 - I am.\\
588 - Mr. Beecher, you heard her
threatening me.\\
589 - No, no, I didn't hear a thing.\\
590 - We're gonna have this out here and
now.\\
591 - No, please, please don't.\\
592 - Mr. Beecher, if she fires that gun,
you're my witness.\\
593 - No, I don't want to be anybody's
witness.\\
594 - I-I say, look here, please.\\
595 - If you've got to kill her,\\
596 - take her out in the hall and do it.\\
597 - Oh, no, I'm gonna do it right here
and now.\\
598 - I'm gonna count to three\\
599 - and then I'm gonna let you have it.\\
600 - One...\\
601 - (screams)\\
602 - Two...\\
603 - three.\\
604 - Aha. Uh, you're, you're afraid to let
me have it, huh?\\
605 - Oh, no, I'm not.\\
606 - I just want to watch you squirm.\\
607 - Now I'm gonna count to three again\\
608 - and then you're gonna get it.\\
609 - One...\\
610 - Two...\\
611 - And... three.\\
612 - (exaggerated groaning)\\
613 - (groaning and gasping)\\
614 - (groaning stops)\\
615 - (yelling and groaning)\\
616 - (gasping for air)\\
617 - (groaning stops)\\
618 - (yelling and groaning)\\
619 - (coughing)\\
620 - (gasping for air)\\
621 - (coughing)\\
622 - (startled gasp)\\
623 - I didn't see a thing!\\
624 - Not a thing!\\
625 - Not a solitary thing!\\
626 - (laughing)\\
627 - He's gone.\\
628 - Oh, Lucy, you were superb.\\
629 - Oh, you weren't bad yourself, girl.\\
630 - No, I wasn't.\\
631 - (screams)\\
632 - ETHEL: Oh...\\
633 - Yes. Yes, Mrs... yes.\\
634 - Uh, that will be fine.\\
635 - Thank you.\\
636 - Mr. Beecher called Mrs. Hammond,\\
637 - but he didn't tell her a thing about
it.\\
638 - He said that she should go over, pick
up his clothes,\\
639 - and he... if he got his money back,\\
640 - he would be very happy to call off
the whole deal.\\
641 - Well, does he want all of his money
back?\\
642 - He lived there a week.\\
643 - Who cares?
We got rid of him.\\
644 - Yeah, that's right.\\
645 - Hey, kids, I got some great news for
you.\\
646 - Oh, have we got news for you.\\
647 - Wait till Yeah. 	      you
hear it.\\
648 - Everything just worked out fine.\\
649 - Hey, oh, gee, I'm so happy I found
you all together.\\
650 - I got some wonderful news for you.\\
651 - What is this-- the Associated Press?\\
652 - We've all got news.\\
653 - Okay, now, ladies first.
What's your news?\\
654 - Well, Ethel and I brilliantly
arranged\\
655 - to get rid of Mr. Beecher.\\
656 - The apartment is ours.\\
657 - Oh, no!\\
658 - What's the matter?\\
659 - I found an apartment for you and paid
down\\
660 - two months rent in advance.\\
661 - Oh, no!\\
662 - First we have no apartment, now we
got two.\\
663 - Ricky, your news.\\
664 - Don't tell me we got three.\\
665 - We don't even need one.\\
666 - Why not?\\
667 - My agent got me another job.\\
668 - We're spending the next two months\\
669 - in Del Mar, California.\\
670 - Oh, no!\\
671 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\

\subsection {Episode 01: The Business Manager}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Breakfast will be ready in a few
minutes, honey.\\
3 - RICKY: Okay.\\
4 - Morning, Lucy.
Hi.\\
5 - Brought up your mail.\\
6 - Thank you.\\
7 - Nothing but bills.\\
8 - Bills, bills, bills.\\
9 - That's all I ever get anymore.\\
10 - Hey, speaking of bills,\\
11 - I hate to bring it up, but how about
the rent?\\
12 - Please, not before breakfast, Ethel.\\
13 - Well, you know, I don't care, honey,\\
14 - but last night Fred found out you'd
only paid half the rent.\\
15 - Couldn't you have kept it from him?\\
16 - You just be happy he didn't find out\\
17 - it was half of last month's rent.\\
18 - Shh!\\
19 - Oh, Ethel, my accounts are all messed
up.\\
20 - These are second and third notices\\
21 - from every company in town.\\
22 - They're threatening to shut off\\
23 - everything but my oxygen supply.\\
24 - (chuckling): Lucy.\\
25 - How many of these things do they send\\
26 - before they really shut things off?\\
27 - I don't know.\\
28 - Hey, I got a friend that works at the
power company.\\
29 - You want me to call her up and find
out how many they send?\\
30 - Okay.		Yeah.\\
31 - (No dial tone)\\
32 - Lucy.\\
33 - What?\\
34 - There's no dial tone.\\
35 - They didn't.\\
36 - I'm afraid they did.\\
37 - They can't do that to me!\\
38 - Why, I've been giving them\\
39 - all my telephone business for years.\\
40 - (coughing)\\
41 - I thought you said breakfast was
ready.\\
42 - Honey, my mouth was all set for
waffles.\\
43 - Oh, well, waffles are so fattening.\\
44 - Dry cereal's better for you.\\
45 - Better for me, too.\\
46 - All right, anything,\\
47 - just as long as I eat something.\\
48 - Okay.\\
49 - It's kind of dark in here.\\
50 - What's the matter with this light?\\
51 - Maybe it's a bad bulb?\\
52 - All our lights are out.\\
53 - Maybe the power is all off all over
the neighborhood?\\
54 - No. I know what happened.\\
55 - Well, I meant to pay the light bill,
Ricky.\\
56 - I was going to say\\
57 - it was probably Fred fooling around
with the fuse box again.\\
58 - Oh, me and my big mouth.\\
59 - Lucy.\\
60 - Lucy.\\
61 - There's nobody in here but us
deadbeats.\\
62 - Lucy, you come out here.\\
63 - Lucy!\\
64 - Now, where do you think you're going?\\
65 - Oh, hi, dear, I'm just going down to
see Ethel.\\
66 - I'll be back in a couple of years.\\
67 - Lucy.\\
68 - You come back here.\\
69 - Yes, sir?\\
70 - I want an explanation.\\
71 - Well, sir, I've had trouble with my
household budget before, sir,\\
72 - but this is the worst it's been in 13
years, sir,\\
73 - and uh...\\
74 - Well, sir, uh, what with the taxes
and inflation\\
75 - and the high cost of living, sir,
uh...\\
76 - it's hard to know which way the
economic pendulum will swing.\\
77 - Uh... well, sir, I...\\
78 - How long are you going to let me talk
before you slug me?\\
79 - You know what I'm going to do?\\
80 - What?\\
81 - I'm gonna get a business manager.\\
82 - A business manager?\\
83 - Yeah, a business manager.\\
84 - A lot of people in show business have
them.\\
85 - I've been thinking about it for a
long time.\\
86 - Well, how does it work?\\
87 - Well, he handles all the money and
pays all the bills.\\
88 - Oh, well, that'll be wonderful!\\
89 - Well, it'll cost a little; I think
it'll be worth it.\\
90 - I'll call him right now.\\
91 - Or is there any point in me trying to
use the telephone?\\
92 - Well, you can try it,\\
93 - but I think you'd have more luck with
two cans and a string.\\
94 - Mr. Hickox, I hope you don't have too
much trouble\\
95 - figuring out my bookkeeping system.\\
96 - You know, I'm not exactly a CPA.\\
97 - (forced chuckle)\\
98 - I'm well aware of that, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
99 - Well aware of that.\\
100 - But I've been in this business for 20
years,\\
101 - and I've never had any trouble\\
102 - figuring out any books yet.\\
103 - Oh.\\
104 - Congratulations.\\
105 - What for?\\
106 - I've finally found a set of books I
can't figure out.\\
107 - Now, I tell you what we think you'd
better do.\\
108 - We'll, we'll wipe the slate clean\\
109 - and start all over, all right?\\
110 - Yes, sir, I'd like that. That's fine.\\
111 - Now, here's your allowance for this
month.\\
112 - Oh, thank you.\\
113 - Well, I wish it was this easy to get
money out of Ricky.\\
114 - That's what I'm here for, Mrs.
Ricardo--\\
115 - to make things easier for you and Mr.
Ricardo.\\
116 - Oh. Well, is this all there is to it?\\
117 - You just give me the money and I
spend it?\\
118 - Well, something like that.\\
119 - Oh, boy, how long has this been going
on?\\
120 - Lucy, we...
Oh, I'm sorry.\\
121 - Oh, hi.
I didn't know you had company.\\
122 - Oh, that's all right.\\
123 - Mr. Hickox, this is Fred and Ethel
Mertz.\\
124 - They own this building.\\
125 - And this is Mr. Andrew Hickox, our
new business manager.\\
126 - Oh, how do you do?\\
127 - How are you?\\
128 - Well, are we just about all figured
out, Mr. Hickox?\\
129 - Well, not quite, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
130 - As well as I can figure out from
these books,\\
131 - you owe a few back bills.\\
132 - A few, yes.\\
133 - I'd like to start you off even with
everybody.\\
134 - Oh, that would be wonderful.\\
135 - Now, let me see.\\
136 - The milk bill, $20.\\
137 - I'll take care of that for you.\\
138 - Thank you.\\
139 - Oh.\\
140 - Oh, out of here?\\
141 - That's what the allowance is for-- to
pay the bills\\
142 - Twenty?\\
143 - How about the month and a half rent?\\
144 - Uh, I'll take care of that for you.\\
145 - Thank you.\\
146 - Now, let me see, telephone, $11.25.\\
147 - Gas and electric, $8.75-- that's $20.\\
148 - Twenty more.\\
149 - And the cleaning and laundry, $15
even.\\
150 - There we are. Now you can spend the
rest any way you want.\\
151 - The rest?\\
152 - There's just $5 left.\\
153 - Five dollars.\\
154 - $5 to buy food and have my hair
dyed-- done?\\
155 - Well, at least I have a choice.\\
156 - I can be a thin redhead or a fat
brunette.\\
157 - We'll see you later, Lucy. Come on,
Fred.\\
158 - Oh, listen, Ethel,\\
159 - may I speak to you in the kitchen
privately?\\
160 - What did you want?\\
161 - Where's the money?\\
162 - Old sticky fingers got it away from
me.\\
163 - Oh...\\
164 - Well, I couldn't have loaned it to
you anyway\\
165 - as long as he knew I had it.\\
166 - Well, Mr. Hickox is just gonna have
to give me more money.\\
167 - Oh, I'll bet you can't talk him into
it.\\
168 - I'll bet I can.\\
169 - What makes you think so?\\
170 - He's a man, isn't he?\\
171 - I have a feeling your old wheedle,
plead and cry routine\\
172 - won't work on him.\\
173 - Want to bet?\\
174 - How much?\\
175 - Five dollars.\\
176 - Okay.\\
177 - (sighs)\\
178 - Mr. Hickox, I, uh...\\
179 - I know you want to be fair about this\\
180 - but, uh, after all, I'm no magician,\\
181 - and the way things worked out,\\
182 - $5 is all that I have left for the
whole month.\\
183 - I know.\\
184 - That's $5 for everything,\\
185 - not to mention miscellaneous.\\
186 - Yes.\\
187 - Uh... that comes to about $1.25 a
week.\\
188 - Right.\\
189 - Uh, per day that is only...\\
190 - 17 and 3/4 cents.\\
191 - 17 and 3/4 cents.\\
192 - Correct.\\
193 - Well, obviously, a family of three\\
194 - cannot live on that.\\
195 - True.\\
196 - So, you will just have to give me
more money.\\
197 - Not a chance.\\
198 - (coughs)\\
199 - Well, my goodness, it's our money!\\
200 - I'm sorry, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
201 - But that's what you hired me for.\\
202 - Well, we didn't hire you\\
203 - to keep our money when we need it.\\
204 - Now, Mr. Hickox, I'm just going to
have to have more money.\\
205 - After all, half of that money is
mine.\\
206 - I worked very hard around here.\\
207 - I take care of the house and I take
care of that baby\\
208 - and if you don't appreciate what I
do,\\
209 - then I guess you just don't want me
around here!\\
210 - I can always take little Ricky
and-and leave you,\\
211 - you selfish beast!\\
212 - You'd better save that for Mr.
Ricardo.\\
213 - Oh.\\
214 - Now, look Mr. Hickox, I can't believe\\
215 - that a charming, wonderful,
understanding man like you\\
216 - would refuse to give me a few paltry
little dollars.\\
217 - Uh, Mrs. Ricardo...\\
218 - Oh, my goodness!\\
219 - I never noticed what beautiful blue
eyes you have.\\
220 - Did anyone ever tell you you look
like Clark Gable?\\
221 - No.\\
222 - Oh.\\
223 - Well, now, Mrs. Ricardo, I'm afraid
you find me\\
224 - a little hardhearted.\\
225 - You have to be in my business.\\
226 - After all, I'm only doing it for your
own good.\\
227 - I know.\\
228 - I know, Mr. Hickox, it's all right.\\
229 - Don't worry about me, I'll manage
somehow.\\
230 - Of course, towards the end of the
month,\\
231 - we'll probably get pretty hungry,\\
232 - and the baby won't have any milk,\\
233 - the poor little thin thing.\\
234 - (sniffling)\\
235 - Well, now, Mrs. Ricardo,\\
236 - you probably have a point there as
far as food is concerned.\\
237 - I tell you what I'll do.\\
238 - You'll give me more money?\\
239 - No.\\
240 - I'll arrange some credit,\\
241 - and you can charge your groceries at
the store.\\
242 - Bu-But what about some extra money
for me for the...\\
243 - for the movies and my clothes and my
hair?\\
244 - You can use your $5 for that.\\
245 - Hi.\\
246 - Hi.\\
247 - Uh... I'm going shopping.\\
248 - Is there anything I can get for you?\\
249 - They're having a sale at Saks.\\
250 - Please, Ethel, don't rub it in.\\
251 - I'm sorry. I know\\
252 - there's nothing I can get for you, is
there?\\
253 - Not unless they're selling money
marked down to nothing.\\
254 - Aw, you poor little thing,\\
255 - you don't have any fun anymore, do
you?\\
256 - Oh, sure, I get to go to the market\\
257 - and pinch the melons and smell the
ground coffee.\\
258 - Lucy...
Hmm.\\
259 - can I ask you a personal question?\\
260 - What?\\
261 - You haven't had your hair touched up
for two weeks.\\
262 - What does it look like under that
scarf?\\
263 - Looks like I'm wearing a black
beanie.\\
264 - I'll bet.\\
265 - See you later.\\
266 - Happy shopping.\\
267 - Happy market.\\
268 - Oh, say, as long as you're going down
there,\\
269 - would you get me a couple of things?\\
270 - Sure.
Let's see, I need\\
271 - a loaf of whole wheat bread\\
272 - and a bottle of half-and-half\\
273 - and a pound of round steak.\\
274 - Bread, half-and-half and round steak.\\
275 - Well, hello, George, long time no
see.\\
276 - They're making the bills smaller,
aren't they?\\
277 - Oh, Lucy, it hasn't been that long.\\
278 - You know, I could pull a fast one on
Mr. Hickox\\
279 - and charge your groceries along with
mine\\
280 - and just keep this money.\\
281 - Yeah.\\
282 - Would serve him right.\\
283 - Yeah, I'll see you later.\\
284 - Ethel!\\
285 - Why not?\\
286 - You wouldn't!\\
287 - Oh, wouldn't I?\\
288 - Don't you need some more groceries
today, Ethel?\\
289 - No, no, I don't.\\
290 - Well, how about tomorrow and the day
after?\\
291 - I'll do your shopping every day.\\
292 - Well...\\
293 - what have I got to lose?\\
294 - And, hey...\\
295 - Where are you going?\\
296 - What are you going to do?\\
297 - Who are you going to call?\\
298 - What I'm doing for you,\\
299 - I can do for everybody in this
building.\\
300 - Hello, Mrs. Trumbull, this is Lucy
Ricardo.\\
301 - Oh, I'm fine, dear.
I was just off to the market\\
302 - and I was wondering, could I pick
something up for you?\\
303 - Oh, no, no trouble at all.\\
304 - I'd be glad to.\\
305 - All right.\\
306 - Uh-huh.\\
307 - Dozen oranges, yeah...\\
308 - and a quart of milk...\\
309 - Oh, come in, Mrs. Trumbull.\\

320 - That's the kind.\\
321 - Oh, and I got a big, fat, roasting
chicken for you.\\
322 - All right.\\
323 - It's a beauty.\\
324 - Oh.\\
325 - And a quart of milk...\\

332 - Thank you.\\
333 - Thank you.\\
334 - Mrs. Ricardo, I hate to seem nosy.\\
335 - Do you mind if I ask why you're doing
this?\\
336 - Oh, I don't know, Mrs. Trumbull,\\
337 - it's just a hobby.\\
338 - A hobby?\\
339 - Yeah, you know, some people collect
stamps, I buy groceries.\\
340 - I guess it takes all kinds.\\
341 - Oh, morning, Mrs. Trumbull.\\
342 - Hi, Lucy.\\
343 - Oh, Mrs. Ricardo, I almost forgot.\\
344 - Tomorrow will you buy me a can of All

345 - All Pet?\\
346 - For my cat.\\
347 - Oh, yes, yes, uh-huh.\\
348 - Tuesday... buy...

349 - Thank you.\\
350 - All right, dear.\\
351 - Good-bye.\\
352 - Bye.	     Bye, Mrs. Trumbull.\\
353 - Well, how's the redheaded
greengrocer?\\
354 - (chuckling)\\
355 - I'm fine.
You want your order?\\
356 - Yep.\\
357 - Loaf of bread.\\
358 - Mm-hmm.\\
359 - Some waxed paper.\\
360 - Yep.\\
361 - Mayonnaise.\\
362 - Mm-hmm.\\
363 - I got the large one.
Is that all right?\\
364 - Yeah.\\
365 - Where's my flour?\\
366 - Right here.\\
367 - Oh, here it is.\\
368 - Yeah, right.\\
369 - That's, uh, $3.80.\\
370 - $3.80... okay, got it right here.\\
371 - One, two, three...\\
372 - (muttering)\\
373 - 3.80.\\
374 - Thank you.\\
375 - How are you doing?\\
376 - Fine. I've been in business a week--\\
377 - I got more money than I know what to
do with.\\
378 - Lucy, I hate to be the one to wipe
that smile off your face,\\
379 - but do you realize that at the end of
the month,\\
380 - you have got to pay that bill at the
market?\\
381 - Oh, no, I don't.
Mr. Hickox does.\\
382 - He's the one that arranged the
credit.\\
383 - But it's your money.\\
384 - But it's his responsibility.\\
385 - He's the business manager, let him
manage.\\
386 - Honey, I'm home.\\
387 - Uh... I'll be right there, dear.\\
388 - Hi, dear.\\
389 - Hello, honey.\\
390 - (quiet chuckle)\\
391 - You had your hair done.\\
392 - Yeah, this morning.\\
393 - It looks nice, but, uh, how could you
afford it?\\
394 - Oh, there are ways.\\
395 - Is that a new dress?\\
396 - Yes. Do you like it?\\
397 - Yeah.\\
398 - But, uh, what cooks?\\
399 - Hair and a new dress...\\
400 - Where you get the money?\\
401 - Please, I don't discuss money
anymore.\\
402 - You'll have to talk to my business
manager.\\
403 - Well, I don't get it.\\
404 - My allowance is completely gone.\\
405 - Bad planning, dear.\\
406 - I don't even have enough money for a
haircut.\\
407 - My goodness.\\
408 - Oh, dear, and you do look a little
seedy.\\
409 - What with the nightclub and all,\\
410 - you really should look your best,
dear.\\
411 - Here you are.\\
412 - Go get yourself a haircut.\\
413 - While you're at it, get a manicure
and a shave.\\
414 - Keep the change.\\
415 - Lucy, wait a minute!\\
416 - Where you getting all this money?\\
417 - Please, never mind.\\
418 - We really should have gotten a
business manager\\
419 - a lot sooner, dear.\\
420 - Hey, Rick?\\
421 - Yeah, Fred.\\
422 - Where are you?\\
423 - Here.\\
424 - Oh, I came over to see if you two
kids\\
425 - could go to the movies with us.\\
426 - I'll pay for it.\\
427 - Well, that's all right.
I'll go with you,\\
428 - but you don't have to pay for it.\\
429 - We're not that broke yet.\\
430 - Oh.\\
431 - As a matter of fact, Lucy is loaded.\\
432 - Loaded?\\
433 - She just showed me a roll of bills
that big around.\\
434 - Ah.\\
435 - She been borrowing money from you?\\
436 - Are you out of your mind?\\
437 - Yeah, I guess I should have known
better than to ask that.\\
438 - Where is she getting the money?\\
439 - Well, maybe your business manager got
soft-hearted.\\
440 - Are you kidding? Mr. Hickox?\\
441 - He makes you look like Diamond Jim
Brady.\\
442 - Well, come to think about it,\\
443 - Lucy and Ethel have been whispering
together\\
444 - until I get near and then they shut
right up.\\
445 - Can't you get Ethel to tell you what
it's all about?\\
446 - No, for once those big blabbery lips
are sealed.\\
447 - I'm telling you, something is
cooking,\\
448 - but I sure can't find out what it is.\\
449 - Well, I only got one clue.\\
450 - What's that?\\
451 - Well, they had their heads together
the other day\\
452 - and before they saw me,\\
453 - I think I heard Lucy say something
about the market.\\
454 - The market?\\
455 - Yeah.\\
456 - The market?\\
457 - Yeah.\\
458 - That's it.\\
459 - That must be it.
What?\\
460 - Lucy's playing the stock market.\\
461 - Lucy Ricardo?\\
462 - Well, I know it sounds kind of crazy
and everything,\\
463 - but, you know, sometimes people,\\
464 - th-th-they get hunches on what horses
to play\\
465 - what stock to buy.\\
466 - Maybe she has a sixth sense.\\
467 - Well, she might; she never had any
before.\\
468 - Well, I know that it's crazy,\\
469 - but, uh, what if she is playing the
stock market?\\
470 - Well, then we'd all better get ready
for another crash.\\
471 - Yeah, I guess you're right.\\
472 - It's too fantastic to be true.\\
473 - I wish I knew where she's getting all
that money.\\
474 - So do I.\\
475 - Hey, Fred.\\
476 - Come here.\\
477 - Look at this.\\
478 - Read that.\\
479 - "Tuesday buy can All Pet."\\
480 - That's it.\\
481 - That's it, what?\\
482 - That must be the stock\\
483 - that she's investing her money in
tomorrow.\\
484 - That doesn't sound like stock.\\
485 - Well, you know how they list them
sometimes.\\
486 - Come on, let's look at the stock
exchange.\\
487 - All right.\\
488 - Here's the paper.\\
489 - Can All Pet.\\
490 - Here it is.\\
491 - Can All Pet.\\
492 - C...\\
493 - Canadian Allied Petroleum.\\
494 - Are you sure you're right?\\
495 - Look, right underneath-- Can All Pet
preferred.\\
496 - Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.\\
497 - And look at the price, look how cheap
it is.\\
498 - Well, maybe Lucy's got a tip that
it's going up.\\
499 - How do you like that?
You know what I'm gonna do?\\
500 - I'm gonna call Mr. Hickox right now\\
501 - and tell him to buy me some of that
stock.\\
502 - Yeah?\\
503 - Yes, and a dozen chocolate cookies,\\
504 - two lemon pies,\\
505 - a devil's food cake\\
506 - and a jar of strawberry jam.\\
507 - Yes, and 25 pounds of sugar.\\
508 - (chuckling): Well, I know it sounds
like a lot,\\
509 - but I have quite a sweet tooth.\\
510 - How's that?\\
511 - Oh, yes, I know we're running up
quite a bill.\\
512 - $473?\\
513 - Oh, well, don't worry about it.\\
514 - Our business manager will take care
of it\\
515 - at the end of the month.
Yes, good-bye.\\
516 - Lucy!
Yeah?\\
517 - Lucy, guess what!
What?\\
518 - Look! Look!\\
519 - Where did you get all that money?\\
520 - The same place you got your money
from.\\
521 - I don't know what you mean. Where?\\
522 - The market.\\
523 - You know. Who told you?\\
524 - If Ethel blabbed...\\
525 - Nobody told me!
Nobody told me!\\
526 - I just found that pad where you write
your tips on.\\
527 - My tips?\\
528 - Yeah.\\
529 - How did you know what to buy? It's
amazing!\\
530 - Amazing? What are you talking about?\\
531 - I just buy what the people want.\\
532 - Oh... just buy what the people want.\\
533 - That's sounds very easy.\\
534 - But how do you know what the people
want?\\
535 - How do you know what to buy and when
to buy it?\\
536 - How did you--\\
537 - a typical, ordinary New York
housewife--\\
538 - know that today was the day to buy
Canadian Allied Petroleum?\\
539 - How you know that?\\
540 - Canadian Allied Petroleum?\\
541 - How did you know that?\\
542 - Well, uh...\\
543 - What?\\
544 - Sit down. Sit down.\\
545 - Let-Let's start from the beginning,
huh?\\
546 - Yeah, yeah.\\
547 - All right. Now, look, Fred overheard
you say\\
548 - something to Ethel about the market.\\
549 - Uh-huh.
Well, we couldn't dream\\
550 - that it could possibly be the stock
market.\\
551 - But then I found that pad there\\
552 - where you had written "buy can All
Pet."\\
553 - "Tuesday, buy can All Pet."\\
554 - So I looked in the stock exchange\\
555 - and there it was, as big as life:\\
556 - "Canadian Allied Petroleum"!\\
557 - Canadian Allied Petroleum.\\
558 - Yeah. So, I-I called Mr. Hickox\\
559 - and I told him to buy me some of the
stock.\\
560 - So you know what he say?
He said it was bad stock.\\
561 - (guffawing)\\
562 - Bad stock.\\
563 - He said it was bad stock.\\
564 - Yeah.\\
565 - (both laughing)\\
566 - I fire him.\\
567 - You what?\\
568 - I fired him.\\
569 - Well-well, what for?\\
570 - Well, who needs him?\\
571 - I do.\\
572 - Now, honey, we can trust your
judgment a lot better\\
573 - than we can trust his.\\
574 - And we can pay our own bills.\\
575 - We can?\\
576 - Sure.\\
577 - Now, honey, tell me something. Um...\\
578 - Where did you get this-this- this
power you have?\\
579 - Is it, uh, is it some kind of a sixth
sense?\\
580 - Yeah. Yeah, th-th-that's it.\\
581 - Some kind of a sixth sense.\\
582 - I, um... I found out\\
583 - that if I just stand still and
listen,\\
584 - a little voice tells me what to buy.\\
585 - A little voice, eh?\\
586 - Yeah.\\
587 - And, uh, and yesterday it said,\\
588 - (with singsong voice): "Buy Canadian
allied..."\\
589 - "Petroleum."\\
590 - "Petroleum," yeah.\\
591 - How about that?\\
592 - Well look, honey,\\
593 - I made $1,000 on this stock.\\
594 - A thousand?!\\
595 - $1,000. So I tell you what I'm gonna
do.\\
596 - I'm gonna give you half of it.\\
597 - Oh, boy.\\
598 - There you are, 500 bucks.\\
599 - Boy.\\
600 - Now I suppose you're going to put it\\
601 - right back in the market?\\
602 - Yeah, that's what I'm going to do
with it all right.\\
603 - Well, um...\\
604 - Uh...\\
605 - What looks good?\\
606 - What does the little small voice say
today?\\
607 - I haven't asked it.\\
608 - Oh, I...\\
609 - Uh... shh... shh...\\
610 - That's funny.\\
611 - What's the matter?
He ain't talking?\\
612 - Uh... I-I can't hear anything.\\
613 - Um...\\
614 - Lucy to Little Small Voice.\\
615 - Come in, Little Small Voice. Over.\\
616 - Lucy to Little Small Voice.\\
617 - Come in, Little Small Voice. Over.\\
618 - I'm sorry, Ricky.\\
619 - I guess the spell was broken once you
found out.\\
620 - Well, keep trying, honey. Keep
trying.\\
621 - Well, I'll try, but I don't really
think\\
622 - there's any use, dear.\\
623 - We'll have time.
Keep trying, dear.\\
624 - Lucy to Little Small Voice.\\
625 - Come in, Little Small Voice. Over.\\
626 - Lucy Ricardo... Huh?\\
627 - Did he say something?\\
628 - No.			No.\\
629 - Uh, come in, Little Small Voice.
Over.\\
630 - Lucy Ricardo calling Little Small
Voice...\\

\subsection {Episode 02: Mertz and Kurtz}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Hi!\\
3 - Hi, girl.\\
4 - What are you doing tonight?\\
5 - Can you come over to dinner?\\
6 - Well, Ricky isn't coming home for
dinner, but I can come.\\
7 - Good.
What's the occasion?\\
8 - Fred's old vaudeville partner is in
town.\\
9 - Not the other half\\
10 - of "Laugh Till It Hurts with Mertz
and Kurtz"!\\
11 - Barney Kurtz.\\
12 - Oh, for heaven's sake!\\
13 - We didn't even know he was in this
country.\\
14 - He's been entertaining royalty all
over Europe.\\
15 - I saw the postcards.\\
16 - Oh, that's right.\\
17 - Listen, can I borrow your big silver
tray?\\
18 - Sure.\\
19 - Oh, I'm afraid it's going to need a
little cleaning.\\
20 - Oh, that's all right. Thanks.\\
21 - We have to put on a little dog\\
22 - so Barney will think Fred has done
all right, too.\\
23 - What do you mean? Fred has nothing to
be ashamed of.\\
24 - Oh, I know, but he's so jealous of
Barney\\
25 - 'cause Barney stayed in show business\\
26 - and got to be a big star.\\
27 - Yeah.\\
28 - Fred got out all of his press notices
this morning\\
29 - and put them all around the room\\
30 - in discreet places.\\
31 - Oh, no!\\
32 - (chuckling): Oh, my God!\\
33 - And if he soft-shoes through the
living room one more time\\
34 - singing "Red, Red Robin,"\\
35 - I'm going to have to let him have it
right in the beak.\\
36 - (guffawing): Oh, no.\\
37 - Say, can I borrow your cruet set,
too?\\
38 - Sure.\\
39 - And let's see...\\
40 - your damask tablecloth\\
41 - and, uh...\\
42 - And let me see...
and the napkins and...\\
43 - and your silver carving set.\\
44 - Why don't you just leave everything
here\\
45 - and borrow the apartment?\\
46 - I'm surprised you haven't asked me to
dress up\\
47 - and go over and serve for you.\\
48 - Well, for heaven's sake!\\
49 - I didn't think you'd mind my asking
you to...\\
50 - Oh, honey, you know I don't!\\
51 - Oh, I know you don't mind.\\
52 - Of course not.\\
53 - Let's see now, what else can I borrow\\
54 - that looks better than what I've got?\\
55 - How about Ricky?\\
56 - That's a thought.\\
57 - Hey, you know, that's not a bad idea
you had.\\
58 - You can't have him.\\
59 - No, no, I don't mean that.\\
60 - I mean you dressing up like a maid\\
61 - and coming over and help me serve.\\
62 - Oh, well, I'll see you later, dear.\\
63 - You run along now.\\
64 - You got a lot to do...\\
65 - Oh, come on, now, Lucy, won't you do
it for me?\\
66 - No!\\
67 - Why not? I never asked you to do
anything like this before.\\
68 - Oh, honey, I can't do that!\\
69 - What would Ricky say?\\
70 - Ricky's not home.\\
71 - Oh, come on now, you just got to do
it for me!\\
72 - I don't got to do it.\\
73 - Well, think of all the hundreds of
things\\
74 - I've done for you!\\
75 - Oh, honey, I don't...\\
76 - (talking over each other)\\
77 - (laughing)\\
78 - Oh, funny.\\
79 - Oh, weren't they wonderful folks?\\
80 - That was a wonderful show, wonderful
show.\\
81 - Honey, what was the name of that mind
reader?\\
82 - Alexander the Great.\\
83 - That's right.\\
84 - Alexander the Great.\\
85 - What a mind reader.\\
86 - He could tell you anything about
yourself.\\
87 - Yeah, he could.\\
88 - Barney, what ever happened to him?\\
89 - Oh, he's working for the income tax
department.\\
90 - (laughing)\\
91 - Barney, would you care for more beef?\\
92 - Please, yes, please.\\
93 - (jingling)\\
94 - Bessy!\\
95 - Madame rang?\\
96 - Yes, madame did.\\
97 - Mr. Kurtz cares for more beef.\\
98 - Yes, ma'am.\\
99 - Barney, tell us all about Europe.\\
100 - Well, when I was making all those
command performances\\
101 - before the crown heads of Europe,\\
102 - I thought of you both.\\
103 - Oh!
Really?\\
104 - Imagine playing before royalty!\\
105 - Well, they're just like ordinary
people.\\
106 - They are?\\
107 - Do they laugh and applaud?\\
108 - I never will forget the first command
performance\\
109 - in the London Palladium.\\
110 - The London Palladium!\\
111 - Gosh!\\
112 - Yes, you know, I was, uh, oh, I was
very hot that night.\\
113 - You know, I kept it topical.\\
114 - Yeah.
I said, uh....\\
115 - "A funny thing happened to me tonight\\
116 - on my way to Buckingham Palace."\\
117 - Buckingham Palace!\\
118 - (guffawing)\\
119 - Buckingham Palace!\\
120 - (laughing)\\
121 - Bessy, you may bring the beef.\\
122 - Yes, ma'am, I'll hustle it right up,
ma'am.\\
123 - Bring some more potatoes, Bessy.\\
124 - Yes, sir.\\
125 - And some green beans.\\
126 - Yes, ma'am.\\
127 - And some rolls.\\
128 - Yes, sir.\\
129 - And could I have\\
130 - a spot of gravy, please?\\
131 - Yes, ma'am... sir!\\
132 - Well, Fred, you seem to be doing all
right\\
133 - with a maid and everything.\\
134 - Well, Barney, if I do say so myself,\\
135 - we're doing pretty well.
Good.\\
136 - We own two a couple of other
apartment houses\\
137 - besides this one.\\
138 - And we have a part-time cleaning
woman.\\
139 - Yeah, and it's too bad our two cars
are laid up\\
140 - or you could use the chauffeur.\\
141 - Well, it couldn't happen to two nicer
people\\
142 - and I'm happy for you both.\\
143 - Oh, thank you, Barney.\\
144 - It's so good to have you with us
again.\\
145 - You know what we ought to do, Fred,
while Barney's here?\\
146 - No.
We ought to get the old gang together\\
147 - and have a party.\\
148 - Oh, that's...
Good idea.\\
149 - Yeah.
...very nice of you,\\
150 - but it can't be done.\\
151 - I just about had enough time to visit
you.\\
152 - Oh...\\
153 - You know I only have a few days,\\
154 - what with the booking agents, Mm.\\
155 - the newspaper reporters, Mm.\\

202 - I told them that I couldn't make it
this time,\\
203 - but I said, "The next trip, I'll come
out there\\
204 - and I'll spend a lot of time."\\
205 - That's good.
Oh, fine.\\
206 - Barney, and speaking of Indianapolis,\\
207 - Yeah?

moonlight\\
227 - Oh, by gee, by gosh, by gum, by gum\\
228 - Ta, da, ya, ta, da, da, da\\
229 - Oh By Jingo, can't you hear I love

237 - She said, "Don't you bother me."\\
238 - Ti, da, ya, da, di, da, di\\

257 - Boy, I'll say they don't!\\
258 - That is a real sensational number!\\
259 - Boy, oh, boy.\\
260 - Do you remember the night the fella\\
261 - fell into the orchestra pit?\\
262 - Oh, no!\\
263 - (laughing hysterically)\\
264 - LUCY: No!\\

getup?\\
286 - Why, uh, she's kind of, uh, uh...\\
287 - Oh, dear!\\
288 - Oh, what's the use?\\
289 - Barney, I might as well confess.\\
290 - We really haven't got\\
291 - all the money I said we had.\\
292 - This is the only apartment house we
own\\
293 - and the bank owns most of it.\\
294 - We can't afford a maid.\\
295 - That's Lucy Ricardo, Ricky's wife.\\
296 - They live right across the hall from
us, our neighbors.\\
297 - How do you do, sir.\\
298 - I mean, glad to know you, Barney.\\
299 - Glad to know you.\\
300 - Oh, Fred, you didn't have to pretend
with me.\\
301 - Well, you being the big shot, I don't
know...\\
302 - Oh, nonsense.\\
303 - Imagine you putting up a front\\
304 - for your old partner, Barney.\\
305 - I guess it was kind of silly.\\
306 - What do you say we all sit down\\
307 - and have some cake?\\
308 - Oh, thank goodness!\\
309 - My feet are killing me!\\
310 - (laughing)\\
311 - RICKY: Hey, that cake looks good,
huh?\\
312 - Doesn't that look good?\\
313 - Hey, Ricky, you should have heard\\
314 - the number Barney and Fred did.\\
315 - It was so great!
Yeah?\\
316 - Barney, would you and Fred do another
one ?\\
317 - Would you mind?\\
318 - Would they mind?\\
319 - Would a small boy mind going to the
circus?\\
320 - Well, we might be talked into it.\\
321 - Remember the song we closed the act
with?\\
322 - Do I?\\
323 - I want a girl just like the girl\\
324 - That married dear old Dad\\
325 - She was a pearl\\
326 - And the only girl that Daddy ever had\\
327 - A good old-fashioned girl with heart
so true\\
328 - One who'll love nobody else but you,
ooh...\\
329 - I want a gal just like the gal\\
330 - That married dear old Dad.\\
331 - (cheering)\\
332 - I told you, Fred.\\
333 - You can't fix that thing by just
tightening it up.\\
334 - You got to take that whole handle off
to fix it.\\
335 - All right, all right.\\
336 - Now, you know all about it, you fix
it.\\
337 - Well, you're the landlord, aren't
you? You fix it.\\
338 - Besides, I don't want to get my hands
dirty.\\
339 - Well, that's swell.\\
340 - That's swell.\\
341 - There now!\\
342 - If anybody can open that door from
the outside\\
343 - without a key, I'll eat it.\\
344 - Oh! oh, Fred.\\
345 - Oh, hi, Fred.\\
346 - We got a surprise for you.\\
347 - Wait till you hear what happened.\\
348 - What?
Wait till you hear.\\
349 - We just had a letter from Barney's
daughter.\\
350 - Yeah, what is it all about?\\
351 - Well, we had this idea...\\
352 - We? I had the idea.\\
353 - Well, okay, Lucy had this idea\\
354 - to wire Barney's daughter\\
355 - and ask if the little grandson\\
356 - could come to New York and stay with
us.\\
357 - And surprise Barney!\\
358 - Gee, that's a great idea!\\
359 - Yeah. When is he coming?\\
360 - Oh, we got so excited, we didn't
finish the letter.\\
361 - "Thank you so much for your kind
invitation\\
362 - "for little Barney to visit New York
and see his granddad.\\
363 - "He is all excited about seeing his
famous grandfather perform\\
364 - during his New York engagement."\\
365 - New York engagement?\\
366 - Oh, she must have misunderstood.\\
367 - "I'm putting him on the midnight
train tonight\\
368 - "and he will arrive in New York
Thursday afternoon\\
369 - at the Pennsylvania station at..."\\
370 - That's today!\\
371 - Why, sure it is!\\
372 - Gee, won't Barney get a kick out of
this?\\
373 - I bet he will.\\
374 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
375 - Somebody's here.\\
376 - LUCY: We'll have to pick him up.\\
377 - Oh, eh, eh, B-B-Barney!\\
378 - Hello!\\
379 - Come on in.
Glad to see you.\\
380 - Hi, Barney.\\
381 - Glad to see you.\\
382 - Oh, uh, Fred, I knocked on your door.\\
383 - There wasn't any answer, so I came
over here.\\
384 - Well, sit down, Barney.\\
385 - Sit down.\\
386 - I've got something to tell you.\\
387 - I should have told you before.\\
388 - I, uh... I'm an awful phony.\\
389 - What do you mean?\\
390 - Well, I haven't been in Europe\\
391 - all these years\\
392 - starring in vaudeville.\\
393 - I've been living in New York.\\
394 - I'm a cook in a restaurant up in the
Bronx.\\
395 - Oh, no!\\
396 - Oh, my goodness.\\
397 - This is terrible.\\
398 - Now, I'm sorry I upset you.\\
399 - Now, please don't be mad.\\
400 - No, no, Barney.\\
401 - We're not mad at you.\\
402 - We'd never get mad at you.\\
403 - It's just that when we found out\\
404 - you couldn't go to Indiana,\\
405 - we wired your daughter\\
406 - to send your grandson on to New York
to stay with us.\\
407 - Oh, no! Oh, I have to wire them not
to come.\\
408 - It's too late.
He's on his way.\\
409 - Oh...\\
410 - Oh, this is a fine mess.\\
411 - Yeah, Ethel, some lousy idea you had.\\
412 - I had?\\
413 - Okay, okay, doesn't matter whose idea
it was.\\
414 - Now, the point is that you've gotten
Barney into a jam.\\
415 - Now, we've got to figure a way to get
him out of it.\\
416 - Yeah.
Listen, Barney,\\
417 - could you get		Huh?
a couple of days off\\
418 - from the restaurant?\\
419 - Well... yes.\\
420 - Now, listen, now you take a room at a
hotel,\\
421 - show the little fellow around New
York city\\
422 - and he'll never know the difference.\\
423 - RICKY: Yeah!
Sure!\\
424 - No, no, no, it won't work.\\
425 - Why not?\\
426 - Because I haven't got a dime.\\
427 - I've been sending all my money home\\
428 - for the little fellow.\\
429 - I've been wanting to educate him.\\
430 - Besides, I... I told him I was
performing in New York\\
431 - and I couldn't come to visit him.\\
432 - That's what she must have meant in
the letter.\\
433 - Yeah.\\
434 - I can explain to my daughter.\\
435 - She'd understand.\\
436 - But how am I going to tell little
Barney\\
437 - that his grandfather, his famous
grandfather\\
438 - isn't famous after all?\\
439 - Just a has-been.\\
440 - I had a friend of mine send him a lot
of postcards\\
441 - from all over Europe.\\
442 - The same ones they sent to you.\\
443 - Mm-mm.\\
444 - He wants to grow up and be like his
granddaddy.\\
445 - He thinks I'm kind of special.\\
446 - Barney...
Hmm?\\
447 - you're going to be performing\\
448 - when that little fella gets to New
York.\\
449 - What do you mean? Where?\\
450 - Ricky, tell him where.\\
451 - Yeah!\\
452 - Where?\\
453 - At the Tropicana!\\
454 - Yeah, at the Tropicana!\\
455 - Sure!\\
456 - Wait, wait a minute.\\
457 - I haven't been on the stage in years.\\
458 - I can't do anything.\\
459 - Oh, honey, sure you can!\\
460 - We'll all help you.\\
461 - Yeah.
What do you mean?\\
462 - Oh, we'll do that old bathing bit\\
463 - that you did on the quayside.\\
464 - That's a good idea.\\
465 - There's a part in it for all of us!\\
466 - Can I be in it, too?\\
467 - Sure!	Sure!\\
468 - Oh, boy!\\

All right!\\
476 - (band playing fanfare)\\
477 - (cymbals clashing)\\
478 - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.\\
479 - If you're wondering\\
480 - why the Tropicana looks kind of
different tonight,\\
481 - with a curtain and everything,\\
482 - it's because we're putting a very
special kind of a show,\\
483 - featuring a very special kind of a
gentleman.\\
484 - He's an internationally famous
entertainer, Mr. Barney Kurtz.\\
485 - That's my grandpa!\\
486 - (Ricky and others laugh)\\
487 - That's right!\\
488 - And here's our guest of honor,\\
489 - Barney's grandson, little Barney.\\
490 - Let's give him a nice, big hand,
everybody. Yeah.\\
491 - Take a bow.\\
492 - RICKY: Come on, take a bow!\\
493 - Attaboy!\\

36 - Now, just wait.\\
37 - "Craig, an accountant\\
38 - "was working in his office at the
time of the robbery.\\
39 - "Mrs. Craig had called earlier\\
40 - "to report that she thought she heard
prowlers\\
41 - "and urged her husband to come home.\\
42 - "and found my wife bound and gagged\\
43 - "and the apartment ransacked.\\
44 - None of the goods was insured,
admitted Craig."\\
45 - Isn't that awful?\\
46 - Terrible.\\
47 - It's unforgivable.\\
48 - I should say so.\\
49 - Imagine not being insured.\\
50 - Oh, you missed the whole point.\\
51 - What do you mean?\\
52 - That man didn't love his wife very
much\\
53 - or he would have come home\\
54 - the minute he thought she was in
danger.\\
55 - Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's
right.\\
56 - Sure.\\
57 - What would you do?\\
58 - What would I do about what?\\
59 - Well, if I called you and told you
there were prowlers,\\
60 - you'd come right home, wouldn't you?\\
61 - What for? We're insured.\\
62 - Well, it's nice to know how you
really feel.\\
63 - I was just kidding.\\
64 - I'll bet you weren't.\\
65 - Of course I was.\\
66 - Well, if I called you at the club\\
67 - and told you there were prowlers,\\
68 - would you come right home?\\
69 - The minute you call.\\
70 - What if you were busy?\\
71 - It wouldn't matter.\\
72 - What if you were doing a number?\\
73 - Would you leave in the middle of it?\\
74 - Right between the "baba" and the
"loo."\\
75 - Oh, honey, you're wonderful.\\
76 - Thank you.\\
77 - Would you really come home the minute
I called?\\
78 - If I had the slightest hint\\
79 - that you were in any kind of danger,\\
80 - I would come flying from the ends of
the earth.\\
81 - Hmm...\\
82 - (sighs)\\
83 - Hello. I'd like to speak to Mr.
Ricardo, please.\\
84 - This is Mrs. Ricardo.\\
85 - Well, even if he is in rehearsal,\\
86 - I have to talk to him right away.\\
87 - Hello, Ricky?\\
88 - Ricky, listen, a horrible,
strange-looking man\\
89 - just came to the front door\\
90 - and-and he said that he was trying to
sell something\\
91 - and I didn't believe him,\\
92 - so I slammed the door in his face\\
93 - and-and then a few minutes later,\\
94 - I-I heard something on the fire
escape\\
95 - and-and I think I saw his face.\\
96 - And, oh, he was just
horrible-looking.\\
97 - He had big, bulgy eyes\\
98 - and-and he had a long, black, droopy
mustache\\
99 - and-and long, snaggly teeth.\\
100 - And-and he was about seven feet tall.\\
101 - You'd better hurry home, honey.
Hurry! Hurry!\\
102 - Lucy! Lucy!\\
103 - Where are you, Lucy?!\\
104 - Here I am.\\
105 - Where?!
Where?!\\
106 - Are you all right?\\
107 - Oh, are you all right?\\
108 - Where is he?
Where is he?\\
109 - Who?\\
110 - Well, Ricky just phoned\\
111 - from the club and said some
evil-looking man\\
112 - was trying to break into the
apartment.\\
113 - Yes, he said he had a long, black
beard\\
114 - and he was eight feet tall!\\
115 - Oh, you mean he told you to come over
here and protect me\\
116 - until he could get here, huh?\\
117 - Nope. He just wanted us to call him
back\\
118 - if anything was wrong.\\
119 - How do you like that?\\
120 - Here I am in terrible danger\\
121 - and all he does is sit by the phone.\\
122 - Are you in terrible danger?\\
123 - Of course not.\\
124 - Oh, Lucy, what is all this?\\
125 - Well, I read in the paper this
morning\\
126 - where some woman called her husband\\
127 - and told him that there were prowlers\\
128 - and he didn't come home and their
house was robbed.\\
129 - So?\\
130 - So, that proves that\\
131 - that man did not love his wife.\\
132 - So, I just called Ricky to find out
if he really loved me.\\
133 - Oh, no.\\
134 - And, apparently, I got my answer.\\
135 - I could have been murdered\\
136 - while he was waiting for you to call
him back.\\
137 - You still might be.\\
138 - Fred... Fred.\\
139 - Oh, honestly, Lucy,\\
140 - how could you pull a stunt like this?\\
141 - Oh, my heart's still pounding.\\
142 - Yeah, mine, too.\\
143 - Now, listen, Lucy,\\
144 - my blood pressure has better things
to do\\
145 - than play "he loves me, he loves me
not."\\
146 - Well, maybe someday\\
147 - some-something will really happen to
me\\
148 - and then you'll be sorry.\\
149 - Do you want to bet?\\
150 - Oh, Fred.\\
151 - Come on, we'd better call up Ricky\\
152 - and tell him it was just a false
alarm.\\
153 - All right.
Never mind.\\
154 - I'll call him.\\
155 - Okay.\\
156 - I have to speak to Mr. Ricardo,
please.\\
157 - This is Mrs. Ricardo again.\\
158 - Ricky! Ricky, where are you?!\\
159 - That man is still here!\\
160 - He-he-he hid in the closet; h-he's
got a gun and...\\
161 - and when the Mertzes came in,\\
162 - he made me tell the Mertzes...\\
163 - Aa-ahh, oh, no!\\
164 - No! No! Don't do that!\\
165 - Please, please! Help!\\
166 - Help! Ricky!\\
167 - Ri-Rick!\\
168 - (gagging): Rick! Rick!\\
169 - Okay, Lucy, you can stop now...\\
170 - Oh, honestly, how far can you go?\\
171 - Come on, Lucy.\\
172 - Ricky knows you're just calling him
to test him.\\
173 - Lucy?\\
174 - You can come out now.\\
175 - We know you're fooling.\\
176 - Lucy?\\
177 - Lucy?\\
178 - Fred! Fred!\\
179 - Oh...\\
180 - Now what?\\
181 - Fred, Fred, look at this room.\\
182 - This time I think\\
183 - something really has happened to her.\\
184 - She's not here.\\
185 - Did you look every place?\\
186 - Well, I looked every place except the
bedroom.\\
187 - Let's look in there.\\
188 - She's got to be around here
someplace.\\
189 - Okay.\\
190 - ETHEL: She isn't here.\\
191 - FRED: Well, you look in the bathroom\\
192 - and I'll look in all the closets.\\
193 - ETHEL: The closets.\\
194 - No, she isn't in there.\\
195 - She wouldn't go away and leave the
baby.\\
196 - She never has; she's got to be around
here someplace.\\
197 - I think I'd better call Ricky.\\
198 - FRED: Oh, I wish you wouldn't bother
him.\\
199 - EHTEL: Oh, he'd never forgive me if I
didn't call him, Fred.\\
200 - FRED: Oh, I don't want to disturb him
now.\\
201 - He's down there rehearsing.\\
202 - ETHEL: ...if anything like this
happened to us,\\
203 - you know, you know he'd want you to
call him.\\
204 - FRED: She'll show up in a minute.
Just take it easy.\\
205 - Well, I didn't look in here.\\
206 - No, you didn't look in there.\\
207 - No, she's not in there either.\\
208 - Oh, Fred...\\
209 - I think this time something really
has happened to her.\\
210 - Oh, now, don't be so dramatic.\\
211 - She's just trying to give us a good
scare.\\
212 - FRED: Lucy!\\
213 - I'm going to call Ricky.\\
214 - Oh, I wish you wouldn't disturb him.\\
215 - I won't. I won't.\\
216 - Now, tell him we're not sure.\\
217 - We-we think it's one of Lucy's dumb
stunts.\\
218 - May I speak to Mr. Ricardo, please?\\
219 - Now, be nice and calm.\\
220 - Don't worry.\\
221 - Hello, Ricky, we're up here and
Lucy's not anyplace!\\
222 - FRED: Ethel!\\
223 - It's nothing to get upset about!\\
224 - Give me that phone!\\
225 - Listen, Ricky, I think it's one of
Lucy's tricks,\\
226 - but we can't find her anywhere,\\
227 - so maybe you'd better come on home.\\
228 - Yes, come on home.\\
229 - FRED: Yeah, come on home.\\
230 - Don't worry. We'll take care of
little Ricky\\
231 - till you get here.\\
232 - Okay. Okay.
But come on home!\\
233 - Yeah.	    Is he coming?\\
234 - Yes!\\
235 - What happened?!
What happened?!\\
236 - Ricky, Ricky, this is just the way we
found it.\\
237 - FRED: We knew you'd want to see.\\
238 - Are you sure she's not hiding
someplace?\\
239 - Have you looked everywhere?\\
240 - In the closets and everywhere,
there's no...\\
241 - I even looked behind the shower
curtain.\\
242 - Oh.
While we were waiting for you,\\
243 - I went around to the other
apartments.\\
244 - Nobody has seen a sign of her.\\
245 - Oh, I don't know what to think.\\
246 - I don't know what to think now.\\
247 - I don't know whether something\\
248 - has really happened to her\\
249 - or maybe she's just yelling tiger?\\
250 - FRED: What?\\
251 - You know, yelling tiger.\\
252 - You mean crying wolf?\\
253 - Yeah.\\
254 - Oh, if anything's happened to Lucy,\\
255 - I'll never forgive myself.\\
256 - I shouldn't have gone away and left
her.\\
257 - FRED: How do you think I feel?\\
258 - I'm the one that said I wouldn't care\\
259 - if something did happen to her.\\
260 - What happened to her is all my fault.\\
261 - I should have come home\\
262 - the minute that she called me.\\
263 - Just think, right now she might be in
terrible danger.\\
264 - She might be hurt.\\
265 - She might even be...\\
266 - (weeping): Oh, I miss her already.\\
267 - I said some terrible things about
Lucy,\\
268 - but I didn't mean any of 'em.\\
269 - She was a good kid.\\
270 - ETHEL: Yes, she was.\\
271 - Fred's right.\\
272 - She was a good girl.\\
273 - Yes, she was.\\
274 - RICKY: She was a wonderful girl.\\
275 - ETHEL: Yes, she was.\\
276 - Hey, what are we saying?\\
277 - She is a good girl.\\
278 - Nothing could have happened to her!\\
279 - RICKY: She is a good girl.\\
280 - I bet you she's all right.\\
281 - My God, if something happens to Lucy,
what...\\
282 - Gee, I love her so much,\\
283 - I-I just wouldn't want to live,
that's all.\\
284 - I'm going to call the police.\\
285 - Yes, that's a good idea.	   
Yeah.\\
286 - Wait a minute. Supposing she's
playing a trick?\\
287 - Supposing it's a gag?\\
288 - Well, I don't care.
We just can't take any more chances.\\
289 - (phone ringing)\\
290 - Who's this now?\\
291 - Hello.\\
292 - WOMAN: Hello. Uh, Mr. Ricardo?\\
293 - Yes?\\
294 - You don't know me,\\
295 - but I'm your neighbor, Mrs. Devries.\\
296 - I live in the apartment building
across the street.\\
297 - RICKY: Yes.\\
298 - Now, I'm sure there must be a very
good reason,\\
299 - and I'm sure you know what you're
doing,\\
300 - but is anything wrong?\\
301 - Well, what do you mean?\\
302 - Well, I know your wife is a little
peculiar...\\
303 - Yeah, well, look, I'm awfully busy
right now.\\
304 - Could-could you call me back a little
later?\\
305 - Well, uh... I certainly can\\
306 - as long as you know that your wife\\
307 - is sitting on the ledge outside of
your window.\\
308 - Ah, well, don't worry about...\\
309 - What?!\\
310 - Oh, it's a good, wide ledge.\\
311 - I just wanted to make sure that
everything was all right.\\
312 - Oh, yes, yes, everything is just
fine.\\
313 - Thank you very much for calling.\\
314 - Oh, you're welcome. Good-bye.\\
315 - And thank you very much\\
316 - for having those costumes ready for
Thursday.\\
317 - That's very nice of you.\\
318 - Good-bye.\\
319 - That was that fellow that, uh, I was
worrying\\
320 - about the costumes for Thursday for
the new show.\\
321 - Well, he called me, and he said\\
322 - he'd have it ready Thursday.\\
323 - But, uh, what about Lucy?\\
324 - Aren't you going to call the police?\\
325 - Yeah, I'll call them in a minute.\\
326 - RICKY: Isn't that nice about the
costumes?\\
327 - FRED: Yeah.\\
328 - On second thought,\\
329 - I don't think I'll call the police.\\
330 - It'd be bad publicity for me.\\
331 - ETHEL: That's right, Ricky.\\
332 - And after all, what can the police
do?\\
333 - If she's gone, she's gone, that's
all.\\
334 - I'll just have to get used to it.\\
335 - Gee, I'm gonna miss her though.\\
336 - FRED: If you miss her too much,\\
337 - you can always get a parrot\\
338 - and make it nag you and throw your
money away!\\
339 - No. I think the thing to do\\
340 - is to get her out of my mind.\\
341 - Just get rid of everything\\
342 - that reminds me of her.\\
343 - Ethel, would you like her clothes?\\
344 - ETHEL: Oh, yes. There are a couple of
dresses I'd like.\\
345 - Of course I'll have to have them
altered.\\
346 - She's much bigger in the hips than I
am.\\
347 - Oh, Ricky, could I have\\
348 - those beautiful stone martins of
hers?\\
349 - RICKY: Sure.\\
350 - How about her lynx stole?\\
351 - Hmm, I don't think so.\\
352 - FRED: Go ahead and take it.\\
353 - We can always use it for a bath mat.\\
354 - You know, it's too bad\\
355 - about Lucy being gone and all that.\\
356 - It's a bit of tough luck all right,\\
357 - but the worst part of it is little
Ricky.\\
358 - Little Rick will be without a mother.\\
359 - ETHEL: Oh, yes.\\
360 - FRED: How about that?\\
361 - RICKY: Without his mother to guide
him.\\
362 - ETHEL: Oh, the poor little thing.\\
363 - There's only one thing for you to do,
Rick:\\
364 - You'll have to remarry.\\
365 - You really think so?\\
366 - You have to think of your son.\\
367 - Yeah, I guess you're right.\\
368 - Of course I'll have to wait\\
369 - a respectable length of time.\\
370 - ETHEL: Oh, of course.\\
371 - How long would you wait?\\
372 - RICKY: About ten days.\\
373 - (pounding on window)\\
374 - Lucy!\\
375 - Look, a dove!\\
376 - Oh, it's Lucy!\\
377 - Lucy!\\
378 - ETHEL: Lucy!\\
379 - Honey, you've come back!\\
380 - Yeah, a lot you care.\\
381 - I'm not even cold yet,\\
382 - and you're already getting married
again!\\
383 - And you go around\\
384 - telling everybody I got big hips!\\
385 - And as for you, you big walrus,\\
386 - get your wet feet off my lynx stole!\\
387 - (laughing uncontrollably)\\
388 - Well, what's so funny?\\
389 - (still laughing)\\
390 - We knew you were outside that window
all the time.\\
391 - FRED: Sure.
You did not!\\
392 - Yes, we did, honey.\\
393 - Mrs. Devries from across the street
called up\\
394 - and told us you were out there.\\
395 - (laughing)\\
396 - And listen, you,\\
397 - I just had about enough of these
phony stories.\\
398 - Phony?! What do you mean?\\
399 - Why do you think I crawled out\\
400 - on that ledge in the first place?
I... I...\\
401 - I was trying to escape from that
horrible man.\\
402 - You should have seen him.\\
403 - He was horrible.\\
404 - Lucy?\\
405 - Well, he was,\\
406 - and he-he forced his way in here\\
407 - and he chased me around and around
and around.\\
408 - Well, he did!\\
409 - Come on, honey, you're holding up the
game.\\
410 - What's she doing?\\
411 - Maybe she met another prowler.\\
412 - I heard that.\\
413 - Come on, honey.\\
414 - If we're going to play bridge, let's
play bridge, huh?\\
415 - I'm not sure I want to play with
people who make fun of me.\\
416 - Oh, honey, I'm sorry, but I can't
help it.\\
417 - Every time you get out of our sight,\\
418 - you run into a bunch of cutthroats.\\
419 - Where are they hiding this time,
under the bed?\\
420 - Now, listen to me, Fred Mertz!\\
421 - All right, all right, all right! Hold
it, everybody.\\
422 - Now, we all know that Lucy has a very
vivid imagination\\
423 - and we all know that we can't believe
one word she says.\\
424 - Now, listen, whether you believe me
or not,\\
425 - that man was here this afternoon.\\
426 - Oh, come now, honey.\\
427 - Well, he could have been.\\
428 - After all, those people who were
robbed live in this neighborhood\\
429 - and those thugs might still be around
here.\\
430 - You know how crooks are.\\
431 - No. How are they?\\
432 - Oh, you know what I mean.\\
433 - Once they rob one house in a
neighborhood,\\
434 - they very often rob another one a
couple blocks away.\\
435 - She's right, Ricky.\\
436 - All the crooks I know are just like
that.\\
437 - Once they find a neighborhood they
like, they stick to it.\\
438 - They're a loyal bunch.\\
439 - Especially the eight-foot-tall,
fiendish ones.\\
440 - LUCY: Oh, you're all so smart.\\
441 - Now, where are you going?\\
442 - Out. I'm sure you don't care where I
go\\
443 - or what happens to me, and neither do
I.\\
444 - Oh, Lucy, you're going to ruin the...\\
445 - Oh... now, where do you suppose she's
going?\\
446 - Oh, she'll go out in the hall\\
447 - and sit for a while and mope\\
448 - and then she'll come back.\\
449 - Honestly, sometimes she acts just
like a baby.\\
450 - Yeah.\\
451 - Have you ever thought of putting her
in a basket\\
452 - and leaving her on somebody's
doorstep?\\
453 - (chuckling)\\
454 - Come on, let's play three-handed till
she comes back.\\
455 - All right.
You bid, Rick.\\
456 - Okay...\\
457 - Ricky, she's been gone for a long
time.\\
458 - Don't you think you ought to go look
for her?\\
459 - That's just what she wants us to do.\\
460 - She wants us to go out there and beg
her to come back.\\
461 - Are you sure she's sitting out there?\\
462 - I'll go take a look.\\
463 - Now, shh! Keep quiet.\\
464 - She's just sitting out there like a
spoiled child.\\
465 - (shouting): Come on, let's play
another hand!\\
466 - FRED: All right.\\
467 - ETHEL: Okay.\\
468 - (screaming): Help!\\
469 - There she goes again.\\
470 - Ricky!\\
471 - Hey, you know, that was pretty good,\\
472 - the way she did that.\\
473 - Ricky!\\
474 - Oh, that's not so tough.\\
475 - Ricky! Help! Help!\\
476 - LUCY: Ahh! Help!\\
477 - Ricky!\\
478 - Help!\\
479 - Help!\\
480 - You know, how about that, uh, "fading
away" effect?\\
481 - That's, uh...\\
482 - That's a pretty good effect.\\
483 - You know, I knew a ventriloquist once\\
484 - who could do that with his voice.\\
485 - Is that right?
Yeah.\\
486 - That's pretty clever.
Uh-huh.\\
487 - She's got a lot more talent than I
give her credit for.\\
488 - (thumping)\\
489 - Lucy?\\
490 - Lucy?\\
491 - (Lucy muttering)\\
492 - Now what?\\
493 - Come on in, honey.\\
494 - The door is open.\\
495 - (thumping)\\
496 - Oh, well.\\
497 - Very good!\\
498 - Very good!\\
499 - Bravo!\\
500 - Very clever.\\
501 - On behalf of the academy,\\
502 - it's my great pleasure to present to
you\\
503 - this beautiful statuette\\
504 - for the best performance of the year.\\
505 - ETHEL: Bravo!\\
506 - Bravo!\\
507 - You know, what I can't understand is:\\
508 - How did she tie herself up like this?\\
509 - (muffled muttering)\\
510 - Well, let's take the gag off and hear
her story.\\
511 - FRED: Hey, hey, Rick.\\
512 - You sure you know what you're doing?\\
513 - FRED: If I had Ethel gagged like
this...\\
514 - Fred! Fred.\\
515 - Well, let's hear it anyway.\\
516 - Must be a good one this time.\\
517 - (grunting)\\
518 - There we go.\\
519 - What's the matter with you?
You crazy or something?\\
520 - Why didn't you come out there and
help me?\\
521 - Those two men could have killed me.\\
522 - Oh, there was two men this time.\\
523 - There were!\\
524 - Oh.\\
525 - Ricky, honest, it's true.\\
526 - There really were.\\
527 - Sure. Sure.\\
528 - Ricky, listen to me.\\
529 - Two men came down from the attic\\
530 - and they grabbed me\\
531 - and they-they dragged me down to the
basement.\\
532 - Yes, dear. Yes, dear.\\
533 - But Ricky, they do, and they're loose\\
534 - somewhere in this neighborhood.\\
535 - We're gonna something.\\
536 - Oh, we're gonna something.\\
537 - Well, what?\\
538 - We got to finish our bridge game.\\
539 - Ricky, please, you got to believe me!\\
540 - Ricky, listen, I was sitting on the
steps\\
541 - and these two men came down from the
attic and they...\\
542 - Ethel, Ethel, listen to me, please.\\
543 - They grabbed me, Ethel, and they tied
me up,\\
544 - can't you see?\\
545 - Fred!\\
546 - Fred, somebody, listen to me!\\
547 - Fred! Fred, they tied me up!\\
548 - Fred, can't you see?

1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Oh, no, no, now, Dorothy, please.\\
3 - I want to do it for you.\\
4 - It's the only way.\\
5 - Now, look, you and Sam come over for
dinner tonight\\
6 - and just leave the rest to me.\\
7 - Oh, now, stop worrying about it.\\
8 - We'll have him in the trap\\
9 - before he knows what hit him.\\
10 - Yeah, well, you be here tonight at
7:00, okay?\\
11 - All right, bye-bye.\\
12 - Who are you trapping, this time,
Daniel Boone?\\
13 - Sam Carter, that fellow\\
14 - Dorothy Cooke's been going with for
such a long time.\\
15 - Oh, you mean she finally roped old
slippery Sam?\\
16 - Well, she's got the noose around his
neck.\\
17 - All she wants us to do is help her
tighten it.\\
18 - Us?\\
19 - Yeah.\\
20 - Oh, I don't know, I think I'm a
little rusty.\\
21 - It's been 25 years since I bagged fat
Freddie.\\
22 - Oh, nonsense.\\
23 - Getting a man is just like swimming.\\
24 - Once you learn, you never forget.\\
25 - Anyway, I have a plan.\\
26 - We are going to show Sam what it's
like to be married.\\
27 - First, I'm going to serve a delicious
home-cooked meal,\\
28 - and then we'll all tiptoe in and take
a look at the baby\\
29 - sleeping peacefully in his little
crib.\\
30 - And then we'll all come out here\\
31 - and sit around a big fire and listen
to romantic music.\\
32 - Oh, that'll be nice.\\
33 - Won't it?\\
34 - Yeah. When are you going to show him\\
35 - what it's like to be married?\\
36 - Now, Ethel.\\
37 - Look, Ricky and I will be\\
38 - a wonderful example of a young
married couple\\
39 - and you and Fred will be\\
40 - a wonderful example of an o... oh.\\
41 - You and Fred will be a wonderful
example\\
42 - Yeah?\\
43 - Well, you and Fred will be\\
44 - a wonderful example of a young couple\\
45 - who have been married 25 years.\\
46 - Oh.\\
47 - And are still madly in love with each
other.\\
48 - Me and Fred?!\\
49 - Well, look, for tonight, fake it.\\
50 - Okay, I'll try.\\
51 - All right.\\
52 - What's so special about tonight?\\
53 - She's had her hooks in Sam for three
years.\\
54 - I know it.\\
55 - But he's leaving for California
tomorrow morning.\\
56 - This is her last chance to reel him
in.\\
57 - Tell me something, Cupid.\\
58 - What?\\
59 - Does Ricky know about this?\\
60 - Of course not.\\
61 - And there's no need to tell him
either.\\
62 - Look, the evening will be over, Sam
will propose\\
63 - our mission will be accomplished\\
64 - and Ricky will never know\\
65 - he helped bring another bachelor to
his knees.\\
66 - Oh, hi, dear.\\
67 - Hello, honey.\\
68 - How's my little husband?\\
69 - Oh, not so good.\\
70 - Oh, what's the matter?\\
71 - I got a awful headache.\\
72 - Oh...\\
73 - What's all that?\\
74 - Oh, I just thought we'd have a cozy
little dinner.\\
75 - Just the four of us?\\
76 - What did you do?\\
77 - Get a girlfriend for little Ricky?\\
78 - No, Dorothy and Sam are coming over.\\
79 - Dorothy and Sam who?\\
80 - You know.\\
81 - Oh, you mean Dorothy Spider and Sam
Fly.\\
82 - Hasn't she got him in her parlor yet?\\
83 - I don't know what you're talking
about.\\
84 - Well, look, honey, why don't you call
it off?\\
85 - I'm not in the mood to see anybody
tonight.\\
86 - But, honey, I can't call it off.\\
87 - They've been planning on it for such
a long time.\\
88 - Oh, all right.\\
89 - Hey!\\
90 - Yeah?\\
91 - You never mentioned this before.\\
92 - When did you ask them?\\
93 - Go take your shower, dear.\\
94 - Lucy.\\
95 - When did you ask them?\\
96 - This afternoon.\\
97 - Well, Sam's going away tomorrow\\
98 - and it's her last chance to cat...\\
99 - Her last chance to what?\\
100 - It's her last chance to have dinner
here with him.\\
101 - Why the sudden interest in Dorothy
and Sam?\\
102 - Have you been messing around with
their romance?\\
103 - Of course not.\\
104 - I just think they're two nice people\\
105 - to have dinner with, that's all.\\
106 - I don't care if they never get
married.\\
107 - What is it to me?\\
108 - All right, we'll have dinner.
but let's break it up early.\\
109 - I got a recording session in the
morning.\\
110 - I got to be in bed by 10:00.\\
111 - 10:00?\\
112 - Yeah, I'm sorry, honey, but if I
don't get some rest tonight,\\
113 - I won't have any voice left at all.\\
114 - They'll understand.\\
115 - But, honey, this is your one night
off.\\
116 - I think it'd do you a lot more good\\
117 - to just sit around and relax and have
a few laughs.\\
118 - (guffawing)\\
119 - A few chuckles?\\
120 - (chuckling)\\
121 - A little snicker?\\
122 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
123 - LUCY: Oh, will you get that, dear?\\
124 - I'm not quite ready yet.\\
125 - It figures.\\
126 - Oh, hello, Dorothy!\\
127 - Hi, Ricky.\\
128 - Hello, Sam.
How are you?\\
129 - Rick, nice to see you How have you
been?\\
130 - Fine, thank you.
Wonderful.\\
131 - Here, give me your hat and coat.\\
132 - Thank you very much.\\
133 - How you been, huh?\\
134 - Oh, fine.
Good. Sit down.\\
135 - Make yourselves at home.
Thanks a lot.\\
136 - Um, where's Lucy?\\
137 - RICKY: Oh, she's not ready yet.\\
138 - Oh.\\
139 - You know how long it takes them, Sam.\\
140 - Oh, that's right, you're not married,
are you?\\
141 - No.\\
142 - Not yet.\\
143 - Well, you're cleverer than I thought.\\
144 - How you managed to keep single all
these years...\\
145 - Oh, oh, uh, Ricky, the apartment
looks lovely.\\
146 - Oh, thank you.\\
147 - Sam, uh, they have a lovely baby.\\
148 - Oh, Ricky, could we see him?\\
149 - Well, I wish you could, but he's
already sleeping.\\
150 - Lucy doesn't like anybody to go in
while he's asleep, you know.\\
151 - She really puts her foot down on
that.\\
152 - Well, hello, honey!	     Hi,
Lucy.\\
153 - Sam, so nice to see you again.\\
154 - Thank you, Lucy.\\
155 - Please sit down.\\
156 - Thank you very much.\\
157 - My, aren't they a handsome couple?\\
158 - Oh, Sam's the handsome one.\\
159 - Stop it, Dorothy. Stop.\\
160 - We were just talking about the baby.\\
161 - Oh, talking about babies.\\
162 - Think of the beautiful children\\
163 - these two could have.\\
164 - Imagine, a little girl with Dorothy's
lovely hair\\
165 - and Sam's wide-set eyes.\\
166 - RICKY: Yeah.\\
167 - (laughing)\\
168 - What are you laughing at?\\
169 - I was just thinking, it'd be funny\\
170 - if she turns out to have Dorothy's
lovely eyes\\
171 - and Sam's wide-set hair.\\
172 - Oh, don't pay any attention to him.\\
173 - Aw, no. I want her to look exactly
like Sam.\\
174 - Oh, well, of course she would, dear.\\
175 - Oh, gee, I wish the baby was awake.\\
176 - Well, let's go in and look at him
anyway.\\
177 - What do you mean, let's go in and
look at him...\\
178 - Honey, please.\\
179 - Come on.\\
180 - DOROTHY: Oh, isn't he darling?\\
181 - Husky, huh?\\
182 - Yes, he is.\\
183 - (sniffing)\\
184 - Lucy.\\
185 - Lucy, I smell something burning in
the oven.\\
186 - My chickens!
My chickens!\\
187 - (baby screaming)\\
188 - Oh, no!\\
189 - Oh, no!\\
190 - Oh... oh, my!\\
191 - Oh, my whole dinner!\\
192 - My whole dinner!\\
193 - My whole dinner!\\
194 - Oh, no!\\
195 - And then there I was in the middle of
the stage,\\
196 - and I started singing.\\
197 - Well, I was 12 years old when I sang
the first song\\
198 - and I've been in show business ever
since.\\
199 - Oh, show business must be so
exciting.\\
200 - Yeah, it's a lot of work, but I love
it.\\
201 - Well, the baby is finally asleep.\\
202 - I'm so sorry dinner was ruined.\\
203 - Oh, you fixed something for them,
dear.\\
204 - No, Dorothy did.\\
205 - She's a real good cook.\\
206 - Well.\\
207 - Best meal I had in months.\\
208 - Thank you.\\
209 - I have a warm plate for you in the
kitchen.\\
210 - Oh, no, thanks, Dorothy.
I'm not a bit hungry.\\
211 - Well, as long as you're here now,
I'll excuse myself.\\
212 - I can't keep my eyes open.\\
213 - Oh, well, I'll, I'll fix you some
coffee, dear.\\
214 - That'll keep those big, brown eyes
open.\\
215 - No, eh, eh, no, honey.\\
216 - Uh, I hope you understand.\\
217 - I have a recording session in the
morning\\
218 - and I'm just dead tired.\\
219 - Uh, but, honey,\\
220 - can't you stay just a little while
longer?\\
221 - We-we have company.\\
222 - Well, I know, dear, and I'm awfully
sorry, but...\\
223 - All right, we understand, uh, don't
we, dear?\\
224 - Oh, of course.\\
225 - A man should be able to do\\
226 - anything he wants to in his own home.\\
227 - Right.\\
228 - Good night.\\
229 - Good night.\\
230 - Ricky!\\
231 - Lucy, don't shake your head at me
like that.\\
232 - I told you when I got home that I had
to be in bed by 10:00.\\
233 - I know you did, but I didn't think
you meant it, dear.\\
234 - Well, it's all your fault, dear.\\
235 - My fault, darling?\\
236 - Yes, darling.\\
237 - If you would have consulted with me
before you made your plans,\\
238 - I would have told you.\\
239 - Oh, I'm so sorry,\\
240 - I forgot to ask your permission, Your
Majesty.\\
241 - Sam, we'd better go.\\
242 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
243 - No, don't go.\\
244 - Ricky is not going to bed.\\
245 - Ricky is going to bed.\\
246 - Ricky is not going to bed.\\
247 - He's going to stay here and act
happily married if it kills him.\\
248 - Oh, Lucy, what's the use?\\
249 - It's all ruined anyway.\\
250 - What's ruined?\\
251 - You were right, dear, go to bed.\\
252 - Lucy?\\
253 - Yes, sir.\\
254 - I thought I told you to mess out.\\
255 - Well, I don't care.\\
256 - I only wanted Sam and Dorothy\\
257 - to be as happily married as I thought
we were.\\
258 - Well, tonight has been a glorious
example.\\
259 - Well, tonight doesn't count.\\
260 - This isn't like any other night.\\
261 - You know, the baby cried and the food
burned.\\
262 - Yes, that's true.\\
263 - Yeah, that's true, but why did you
say\\
264 - that tonight is not like any other
night?\\
265 - Now, you cut that out, Ricky Ricardo!\\
266 - You're happily married, and you know
it!\\
267 - Well, all right.\\
268 - Sit down, Sam.\\
269 - Dorothy.\\
270 - What are you going to do now?\\
271 - I'm just going to tell Sam\\
272 - exactly the way I feel about
marriage.\\
273 - Don't you dare!\\
274 - Sit down, Lucy.\\
275 - Sam, my boy, I've been married over
12 years\\
276 - and if I had it to do over...\\
277 - I'd get married again.\\
278 - You would?\\
279 - Yep, I would gladly get married
again.\\
280 - But why?\\
281 - Now, that's a very good question,\\
282 - and it's a hard one to answer.\\
283 - Maybe it's because wives are
economical.\\
284 - Well.\\
285 - Look, Lucy saves me a lot of money on
food.\\
286 - That's right, I do.\\
287 - You know, serving leftovers.\\
288 - Leftovers?\\
289 - Yes, she's great at serving
leftovers.\\
290 - But the strange thing is, I never had
any of the meals\\
291 - that the leftovers were left over
from.\\
292 - Ricky!\\
293 - And yet, I would get married all over
again.\\
294 - I don't know why.\\
295 - Maybe it's the mystery of it all.\\
296 - The mystery?\\
297 - Yeah.\\
298 - You know, Sam, you would think\\
299 - that you would know what your wife
looks like\\
300 - when you married her, right?\\
301 - Well, of course, you would.\\
302 - You got a big surprise coming to you,
my boy.\\
303 - They have a whole other face\\
304 - underneath the face you married.\\
305 - And it must be awful\\
306 - because they never let you see it.\\
307 - You know, when they go to bed at
night?\\
308 - Yeah.\\
309 - They cover it all up with cold cream,\\
310 - and then they get their chins
strapped in a hammock.\\
311 - They wear blinkers over their eyes.\\
312 - And in the mornings...\\
313 - ay-ay-ay, in the mornings...\\
314 - They come staggering out of bed\\
315 - with wire cages in their hair, grease
in their face,\\
316 - and then they proceed to the kitchen\\
317 - where they squeeze you a glassful of
seeds\\
318 - with a little bit of orange juice in
it.\\
319 - They throw some raw bacon and eggs at
you\\
320 - with some burned toast\\
321 - and they give you a cup of coffee\\
322 - that tastes just like mud.\\
323 - Well, I'm very happy to find out how
you really feel.\\
324 - Hi!
Hi.\\
325 - Oh, no.\\
326 - Lover and I thought we'd come up\\
327 - and find out how you were doing.\\
328 - We can't stay very long\\
329 - 'cause you know how honeybunch and I
love to be alone.\\
330 - Married 25 years and still mad about
each other.\\
331 - Oh, shut up.\\
332 - It's too late, Ethel.\\
333 - Lucy!\\
334 - Don't you talk to me, you... you
husband.\\
335 - Honey, I said I would marry you all
over again!\\
336 - Well, I wouldn't marry you again!\\
337 - You had it coming to you.\\
338 - RICKY: I told you not to butt in
other people's business!\\
339 - (door slams)\\
340 - (chuckling nervously)\\
341 - Oh, dear.\\
342 - Let's go.\\
343 - Come on.\\
344 - (shouting): Come on!\\
345 - (shouting): All right!\\
346 - (door slams)\\
347 - I wonder what went wrong.\\
348 - I don't know, but stop leaning on me.\\
349 - You weigh a ton!\\
350 - Lucy, how about my breakfast?\\
351 - There's your orange juice.\\
352 - Oh, I left a few seeds in it as
usual.\\
353 - (rhythmic scraping)\\
354 - I burn an awful lot of toast,\\
355 - but I'm developing quite a beat.\\
356 - Here you are, my famous cup of mud.\\
357 - Well, how do you like it?\\
358 - Like what?\\
359 - This is the distorted picture you
gave Sam last night.\\
360 - Now, if you'd like to apologize\\
361 - for all the nasty things you said,
I'd be very happy\\
362 - to go ahead and fix your breakfast as
I usually do.\\
363 - You just did.\\
364 - Oh!\\
365 - And I suppose I look like I usually
do, too, huh?\\
366 - No, no, I wouldn't say that.\\
367 - I think you look a little better.\\
368 - Ricky Ricardo, you apologize!\\
369 - Why should I apologize?\\
370 - The only reason that I told Sam\\
371 - the things I told him last night\\
372 - is because you and Dorothy were
trying to hook him,\\
373 - and I told you to stay out of his
affairs.\\
374 - Well, for once, I decided not to do
what you told me.\\
375 - For once?\\
376 - You never do what I told you.\\
377 - Then why don't you quit "tolding" me?\\
378 - Ay, que barbaridad!\\
379 - Porque tienes la cabeza mas dura de
ninguna mujer\\
380 - que yo he conocido en toda la vida
entera!\\
381 - Sticks and stones may break my bones,\\
382 - but Spanish names won't hurt me.\\
383 - Sometimes I wish I never left Cuba.\\
384 - That makes two of us.\\
385 - You take that back.\\
386 - I won't take it back.\\
387 - You take back what you said last
night.\\
388 - I will not!\\
389 - Now, are you going to fix my
breakfast or not?\\
390 - I already did, remember?\\
391 - All right, then I'll eat breakfast
downtown.\\
392 - Good!\\
393 - Hmm!\\
394 - And you can have your lunch down
there, too.\\
395 - All right!\\
396 - And your dinner!\\
397 - Okay!\\
398 - You can stay down there, too!\\
399 - Okay, I will! Ha!\\
400 - Good-bye!\\
401 - Well, I will as soon as I change.\\
402 - (doorbell buzzes)\\
403 - (doorbell buzzing insistently)\\
404 - (yawning)\\
405 - Lucy!\\
406 - He isn't home yet, Ethel, and it's
5:00.\\
407 - He wasn't home at 3:00 and he wasn't
home at 4:00 either.\\
408 - Are you gonna come over every hour\\
409 - just to announce that he isn't home
yet?\\
410 - Well, he isn't.\\
411 - Leave the door open, will you?\\
412 - I want to hear the baby.\\
413 - Listen, Lucy, didn't you tell me\\
414 - that when you had your fight,\\
415 - you told him to go away and stay
away?\\
416 - Yes, I did, but I didn't think he'd
do it.\\
417 - Oh, well, now, that makes sense.\\
418 - Gee, Ethel, well, what if he isn't
ever coming home?\\
419 - Well, what... what if something's
happened to him?\\
420 - Oh, now, Lucy, you've got to stop
worrying.\\
421 - You're getting yourself all upset.\\
422 - I can't help it.\\
423 - Put yourself in my place.\\
424 - If Fred was gone and was never coming
home,\\
425 - what would you be doing?\\
426 - Celebrating.\\
427 - You would not.\\
428 - It isn't until they're gone that you
really appreciate them.\\
429 - Oh, Ethel, I love him so.\\
430 - Lucy, don't cry.\\
431 - Hey, hey...\\
432 - What in Sam Hill's\\
433 - all the commotion about?\\
434 - Oh, Ricky still isn't home\\
435 - and Lucy's all upset.\\
436 - He isn't ever coming home, and it's
my fault.\\
437 - Oh, now, honey, he's coming home.\\
438 - I'm, I'm sure he's all right.\\
439 - Sure, you'll probably find him\\
440 - down at the police station, wearing a
cop's hat\\
441 - and eating an ice-cream cone.\\
442 - Oh, dear, if I, if I knew where he
was,\\
443 - I'd call him up, and I'd beg him to
come home.\\
444 - Did you call the club?\\
445 - Yes. He left two hours ago.\\
446 - Oh, suppose we wait a couple of weeks\\
447 - and notify Ellery Queen.\\
448 - Now, Fred, this is serious.\\
449 - I just don't happen to think that it
is serious.\\
450 - Now, listen, Lucy, I know Ricky
pretty well\\
451 - and I just don't believe\\
452 - he's really gonna leave you.\\
453 - Then where is he?\\
454 - He's doing what any other husbands\\
455 - are doing under the same
circumstances.\\
456 - He's just staying away long enough\\
457 - to give you a good scare.\\
458 - Do you really think so?\\
459 - Sure, he's getting you good and
worried\\
460 - so you'll be so glad to see him,\\
461 - you'll forget you're mad at him.\\
462 - Well, if that's what he's doing,\\
463 - then I just won't be there when he
gets home!\\
464 - What?!\\
465 - Two can play at this game.\\
466 - I'll just give him a good scare.\\
467 - Well, why don't you go home and give
it to him.\\
468 - No, I'm not going home; I'm going to
stay right here.\\
469 - What about the baby?\\
470 - You go over and keep an eye on him,
will you, Ethel?\\
471 - No.
Please?\\
472 - No.\\
473 - But, Ethel, I can't just be over
there,\\
474 - standing there, waiting for him when
he comes in.\\
475 - Please.
Absolutely not!\\
476 - Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.\\
477 - I'll go and stay with little Ricky.\\
478 - It's about the only way\\
479 - I'll ever get a night's sleep.\\
480 - Okay, thanks, Fred.\\
481 - Okay.\\
482 - (door shuts)\\
483 - Ethel...\\
484 - Ethel, what if Fred isn't right?\\
485 - What if Ricky really isn't ever gonna
come home?\\
486 - What if...?\\
487 - What if you keep quiet and let me get
some sleep?\\
488 - All right.\\
489 - Ethel! Ethel!\\
490 - (yawning)\\
491 - Ethel, he's home.\\
492 - I just saw him come down the hall,\\
493 - and he brought me candy and flowers.\\
494 - Good.\\
495 - Lucy?\\
496 - Lucy, I'm home.\\
497 - Sweetheart...\\
498 - I guess I owe you an apology.\\
499 - I shouldn't have said all of those\\
500 - awful things that I said.\\
501 - I was in a bad humor\\
502 - and I just blew my top, that's all.\\
503 - But darling, you know I love being
married to you, honey.\\
504 - You are the dearest, sweetest,\\
505 - most wonderful person in the whole
world.\\
506 - You know, I wasn't gonna come home
tonight\\
507 - just to teach you a lesson,\\
508 - and then I got to walking around\\
509 - and I...
I started thinking\\
510 - of all the wonderful times\\
511 - that we had together\\
512 - and how much we meant to each other
and...\\

and some candy.\\
514 - Honey, I-I won't blame you\\
515 - if you never spoke to me again,
but...\\
516 - sweetheart, please say you forgive
me, darling.\\
517 - (falsetto): I forgive you, darling.\\
518 - (howling with laughter)\\
519 - RICKY: What are you doing here?\\
520 - Oh, honey, you should have heard
yourself\\
521 - saying all those things to Fred.\\
522 - Fred, how did you keep from laughing?\\
523 - It wasn't easy.\\
524 - (laughing)\\
525 - Well, I'm real happy\\
526 - I gave you all such a good laugh.\\
527 - Oh, honey, don't be mad.\\
528 - Who's mad?!
I'm not mad!\\
529 - Who's going to get mad?\\
530 - I'm not mad at all!\\
531 - Oh, honey, we're sorry.\\
532 - ETHEL: We're all sorry, Ricky.\\
533 - Oh, Rick... Ricky, where are you
going?\\
534 - Out! And this time, I'm not gonna
come back!\\
535 - But, honey, how about all those
things you said?\\
536 - You said you loved me\\
537 - and all the wonderful times we had
and everything.\\
538 - I take them all back!\\
539 - Oh, Ricky...\\
540 - Out of my way, please.\\
541 - Listen, Ricky, Ricky,\\
542 - I won't mess in any more romances.\\
543 - I'll mess out, I promise.\\
544 - Out of my way, please.\\
545 - (doorbell buzzes)
Please?\\
546 - Oh, now what?\\
547 - We must be making too much noise.\\

\subsection {Episode 05: The Mr. and Mrs. TV Show}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Hi.\\
3 - Hi, honey.
How was the luncheon?\\
4 - Ethel, it was absolutely fabulous.\\
5 - Carol and I went to 21 for lunch.\\
6 - (gasps)
How's the baby?\\
7 - Oh, he's fine.
He's asleep.\\
8 - Wait till you hear what happened.\\
9 - Ricky will just die when he hears.\\
10 - So what happened?\\
11 - When we went in, it was so crowded,\\
12 - we sat with some friends of
Carolyn's,\\
13 - and who do you think the man turned
out to be?\\
14 - Who?
Harvey Cromwell.\\
15 - Harvey Cromwell!\\
16 - Yes!\\
17 - Who's he?\\
18 - Oh, Ethel, don't you know anything?\\
19 - He's Cromwell, of Cromwell, Thatcher
and Waterbury.\\
20 - They're just about the biggest
advertising agency\\
21 - in the country, that's all.\\
22 - No kidding?\\
23 - Yes, and while we were having lunch,\\
24 - Mr. Cromwell just happened to mention
that\\
25 - his agency was looking for\\
26 - a new TV personality to build a whole
show around.\\
27 - So, naturally, I brought up Ricky's
name.\\
28 - Naturally.\\
29 - I was very subtle.\\
30 - Oh, I can imagine-- like a garlic
sandwich.\\
31 - Now, Ethel, I wasn't.\\
32 - I have an appointment for Ricky\\
33 - to see Mr. Cromwell tomorrow morning.\\
34 - No kidding!\\
35 - I have.
(gasps)\\
36 - Gee, Ethel, this will mean a whole
new career for Ricky,\\
37 - and it'll all be because of me.\\
38 - Oh, Ricky will help a little.\\
39 - Oh, of course.
He's very talented,\\
40 - but you know what they say--\\
41 - behind every great man there's a
great woman.\\
42 - Mamie Eisenhower-- we're all back
there.\\
43 - Well, if it gets dull back there,\\
44 - you can always start a bridge game.\\
45 - Oh, Ethel, we're all behind our
husbands,\\
46 - guiding their destinies.\\
47 - We're puppeteers behind the scenes,
pulling the strings.\\
48 - Well, here's Howdy Doody now.\\
49 - Hi, doll!\\
50 - Hello, honey!\\
51 - Wait till you hear what I did today.\\
52 - It may change our whole life.\\
53 - What you do?\\
54 - I went to lunch at 21.\\
55 - No!\\
56 - I went to lunch with a certain man.\\
57 - Well, I hope you two will be very
happy.\\
58 - All right, if you don't want to hear
it, I won't tell you.\\
59 - I won't tell you what big agency man
wants to build\\
60 - a whole TV show around you.\\
61 - Say, honey, what you do today?\\
62 - Well, that's better.\\
63 - You said you had lunch at 21 with a
certain man?\\
64 - Yes, and he's a big agency man\\
65 - and he has a sponsor who's looking
for a show.\\
66 - No kidding?\\
67 - Yes, and I told him all about you\\
68 - and I said that you had some
wonderful ideas for shows\\
69 - and he wants to see you tomorrow
morning.\\
70 - Why, honey, that's wonderful!\\
71 - Isn't that great?\\
72 - Thank you.\\
73 - Tomorrow morning!
Yeah.\\
74 - Boy, I'd better have some good ideas
when I go to see him.\\
75 - Yeah.\\
76 - Let me see now...
what would be good?\\
77 - Yeah, what would be good for us?\\
78 - Yeah, what would be good...?\\
79 - Us?\\
80 - Yeah, us, as in we.\\
81 - We?\\
82 - Yes, we, as in you and me?\\
83 - No.\\
84 - No?\\
85 - Yes, no-- as in not you.\\
86 - Aw, now, Ricky, that isn't fair.\\
87 - I started this whole thing.\\
88 - It's my chance to go coast to coast.\\
89 - Now, look, honey, I love this
country.\\
90 - It's been very good to me.\\
91 - I wouldn't think of doing a thing
like that\\
92 - to my fellow citizens.\\
93 - Well, all right, then.\\
94 - I think I get the full import of
that.\\
95 - I don't have to have a brick wall
fall on me.\\
96 - I can take a hint.\\
97 - Hint?\\
98 - Oh, shut up.\\
99 - You may be interested to know, sir,\\
100 - that I wouldn't be on your program
now\\
101 - if you begged me!\\
102 - Well, that's a very sensible
attitude.\\
103 - Now, who's this man I'm supposed to
see?\\
104 - Lucy, what's the name of the man?\\
105 - Man? What man?\\
106 - Aw, come now!
You can't do that to me.\\
107 - You wouldn't ruin my chance.\\
108 - Why not? You're ruining mine.\\
109 - Oh, now, Lucy, that's not fair.\\
110 - I'll thank you if you'd keep out of
this.\\
111 - Well, I won't let you do it.\\
112 - Ricky, I'll tell you his name.\\
113 - Traitor.\\
114 - Ethel, what's his name?\\
115 - Well...\\
116 - Actually, Ethel,\\
117 - you know, we don't need Ricky.\\
118 - We could build a show\\
119 - around you and Fred and me.\\
120 - Ethel, what's his name?\\
121 - It's...\\
122 - Isn't that funny?
I forgot.\\
123 - Well, it doesn't matter, anyway.\\
124 - I know those agency guys.\\
125 - He was just probably talking.\\
126 - Oh, no, he wasn't.\\
127 - He has a sponsor and the time all
cleared.\\
128 - Sure, sure.\\
129 - Well, he has, and he's a very big
man.\\
130 - Big man!\\
131 - He's probably been saving all month\\
132 - just so he could go to 21 for lunch
once.\\
133 - Probably an office boy.\\
134 - Office boy!\\
135 - That's a fine thing to call Ha...\\
136 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
137 - Oh, no, you see what he's trying to
do?\\
138 - He thinks he's so smart,\\
139 - trying to trick me into saying Harvey
Cromwell.\\
140 - Ow!\\
141 - Harvey Cromwell!\\
142 - Boy, I'll say he's a big man.\\
143 - Thank you, honey.\\
144 - I'll see him first thing in the
morning.\\
145 - Harvey Cromwell!\\
146 - I've given the green light on this
project,\\
147 - so let's get right at it.\\
148 - Let's take it right over tackle\\
149 - and remember, the game isn't over
until the last out.\\
150 - Mr. Cromwell...\\
151 - Yes, Mr. Taylor?\\
152 - Mr. Ricardo is here to see you.\\
153 - Send him in.\\
154 - Yes, sir.\\
155 - You may come in now.\\
156 - Thank you, Mr. Taylor.\\
157 - Hello, Mr. Cromwell.\\
158 - Oh, hello, Mr. Ricardo.\\
159 - It's very kind of you to see me, sir.\\
160 - It's my pleasure.
Thank you.\\
161 - Now, we need a show for the Phipps
Department Store,\\
162 - and our problem is: What kind of a
show?\\
163 - Well, I...\\
164 - Uh, sit down, sit down, Taylor.\\
165 - Let's get as much brain matter\\
166 - on this as possible.\\
167 - Sit down, Ricardo.
Thank you.\\
168 - Well, I had an idea...\\
169 - I'll take the bull by the horns\\
170 - before any more water passes under
the bridge.\\
171 - Everybody think.\\
172 - Well, I made a pilot...\\
173 - Shh, Ricardo!\\
174 - Think!\\
175 - Now I'm just thinking out loud.\\
176 - This is right off the top of my head,\\
177 - but try this on for size.\\
178 - Now, the sponsor wants to appeal\\
179 - to the women in the audience, right?\\
180 - I'll buy that.\\
181 - So, how about one of those
husband-and-wife TV shows?\\
182 - No, no.\\
183 - Oh, it's close, very close.\\
184 - There's a lot of good stuff there,\\
185 - but it won't quite wash.\\
186 - No, no, no, it won't boil the water.\\
187 - Think!\\
188 - I've got it!\\
189 - What?\\
190 - A Mr. and Mrs. TV show!\\
191 - You mean a husband-and-wife show?\\
192 - That's just what you...
Oh, what an idea, H.C.!\\
193 - Thank you.\\
194 - But that's your...\\
195 - Oh, that idea is sheer genius.\\
196 - Thank you, thank you.\\
197 - Now, Ricardo, you and your wife\\
198 - be ready to start rehearsal at a
moment's notice.\\
199 - Well, Mr. Cromwell, I'm afraid
that...\\
200 - What's the matter, you're married,
aren't you?\\
201 - Yes, sir, but, uh, you don't...\\
202 - A charming wife.
I met her yesterday.\\
203 - She thinks she's very talented.\\
204 - Yes, sir, that's just the point...\\
205 - Now, look, here, Ricardo!\\
206 - I'm a very busy man.\\
207 - We've got the train on the track.\\
208 - Let's not fumble the ball.\\
209 - It's a husband-and-wife show or
nothing.\\
210 - Well, if you'd just give me a chance
to explain.\\
211 - Taylor, find out if Cugat is
available.\\
212 - (yelling): Ya-ya-ya-yi!\\
213 - I'll do it.\\
214 - Good boy!\\
215 - Now, I can count on you and your
wife?\\
216 - Yes, sir, you can count on us.\\
217 - Thank you very much, Mr. Cromwell.\\
218 - Thank you, Mr. Taylor.\\
219 - Mr. Ricardo.\\
220 - And don't worry, sir, we'll, uh...\\
221 - we'll boil the water\\
222 - before it passes under the bridge\\
223 - that the train track is on.\\
224 - (raspy-voiced): Every star above
knows the one I love\\
225 - Sweet Sue\\
226 - It's you...\\
227 - Hi!\\
228 - Hello.\\
229 - Uh... I saw Mr. Cromwell.\\
230 - Don't you want to know how the
interview went?\\
231 - No, I'm not particularly interested.\\
232 - Oh.\\
233 - Well, um...\\
234 - you know about that television show.\\
235 - I've been thinking it over and, uh...\\
236 - there's something I'd like to ask
you.\\
237 - Yes?\\
238 - Well, I thought it might be...\\
239 - Well, how would you like it if...\\
240 - Let me put it this way:\\
241 - It-it... it might be a...\\
242 - Nothing.\\
243 - (phone ringing)\\
244 - Hello.\\
245 - RICKY: I'd like to speak to Mr.
Taylor, please.\\
246 - This is Taylor.\\
247 - Mr. Taylor, this is Ricky Ricardo.\\
248 - I just can't...\\
249 - Ricardo! I'm glad you called.\\
250 - H.C. has taken the bull by the horns\\
251 - and he's got the train on the track.\\
252 - Is that good?\\
253 - "Is that good?"\\
254 - We're moving, man.\\
255 - The time's been cleared, the
sponsor's all signed up\\
256 - and we go on the air day after
tomorrow\\
257 - at 8:00 a.m.
from your apartment.\\
258 - Yeah, but listen, uh...\\
259 - And wait until you hear the title
H.C. has come up with.\\
260 - "Breakfast with Ricky and Lucy."\\
261 - Well, that's great, all right, but,
uh...\\
262 - This is going to be one of the
biggest\\
263 - television programs to hit town in
years!\\
264 - Tell your wife to be ready for
rehearsals tomorrow morning.\\
265 - Well, all right.\\
266 - (off-key): Every star above\\
267 - Knows the one I love\\
268 - Sweet Sue\\
269 - It's you.\\
270 - And the moon on high\\
271 - Knows the reason why\\
272 - Sweet Sue\\
273 - It's you.\\
274 - No one else it seems\\
275 - Ever shares my dreams\\
276 - And without you, dear, I don't...\\
277 - That voice-- where is it coming from?\\
278 - Huh?\\
279 - That voice-- where is it coming from?\\
280 - What station is it on?\\
281 - That wasn't the radio.\\
282 - It wasn't?\\
283 - Well, where is that beautiful voice
coming from?\\
284 - From this untalented throat.\\
285 - That was you singing?\\
286 - Yes.\\
287 - What are you trying to do?\\
288 - Nothing. I just don't believe it,
that's all.\\
289 - Go ahead, sing some more.\\
290 - What for?\\
291 - Because I don't believe it.
It was beautiful.\\
292 - It couldn't have been you singing.\\
293 - Go ahead, sing some more.\\
294 - (raspy-voiced): Every star above
knows the one I love\\
295 - Sweet Sue\\
296 - It's you.\\
297 - Wonderful, wonderful!\\
298 - And the moon on high\\
299 - Knows the reason why\\
300 - Sweet Sue\\
301 - It's you.\\
302 - Sing it, honey, sing it!\\
303 - No one else it seems\\
304 - Ever looks in my dreams\\
305 - And without you, dear, I don't know
what I'd do.\\
306 - What grace, what rhythm.\\
307 - I didn't know you could dance that
way!\\
308 - Sure!\\
309 - And in this heart of mine\\
310 - You live all the time\\
311 - Sweet Sue\\
312 - It's you.\\
313 - Bravo!\\
314 - Wonderful, wonderful!\\
315 - Gee, did-did you really like it?\\
316 - Like it? Honey, the talent, I...\\
317 - Well, I'll tell you what we got to
do.\\
318 - There's just one thing that we have
to do.\\
319 - You have to be on that television
show with me.\\
320 - Really?
You really mean it?\\
321 - Yes, I certainly do.\\
322 - I'm going to go right down to that
Mr. Cromwell's office\\
323 - and I'm going to tell him.\\
324 - It's either going to be\\
325 - a husband-and-wife show or nothing!\\
326 - What if he says no?\\
327 - Honey, if he wants me, he'll have to
take both of us.\\
328 - I'll go tell him right now.\\
329 - In this heart of mine\\
330 - Ah, you live all the time\\
331 - Sweet Sue\\
332 - It's you.\\
333 - Okay, everybody, let's have another
rehearsal.\\
334 - Are you all set, Mrs. Ricardo?\\
335 - LUCY: All set.\\
336 - Okay, we'll take it from the top.\\
337 - Okay.\\
338 - Phipps Department Store presents\\
339 - "Breakfast with Ricky and Lucy."\\
340 - Well, hello there!\\
341 - I didn't see you come in.\\
342 - Won't you join us for breakfast?\\
343 - Lucy!\\
344 - We have company!\\
345 - Good morning, darling.\\
346 - Good morning, sweetheart.\\
347 - Would you like to say good morning\\
348 - to our TV viewers?\\
349 - Oh, whoo-hoo!
Good morning, everyone.\\
350 - Did you sleep well, dear?\\
351 - Oh, what a silly question.\\
352 - I was sleeping on a Phipps Foam
Mattress.\\
353 - A Phipps Foam Mattress rocks you to
sleep.\\
354 - Ah...\\
355 - Is breakfast ready?\\
356 - Oh, yes, darling.\\
357 - Thank you.\\
358 - Waffles!\\
359 - That's right, dear.\\
360 - Mmm! It's delicious!\\
361 - Of course, dear.\\
362 - I got it from Phipps Fountain and Tea
Room.\\
363 - Food always tastes better when they
fix it.\\
364 - I don't know what they do to it.\\
365 - Oh, girls!\\
366 - Girls, I just want to tell you
something that happened to me.\\
367 - It was so exciting yesterday.\\
368 - I got out of bed feeling rather drab
and dull,\\
369 - you know, sort of... ugh!\\
370 - And then I went to Phipps, and I
found\\
371 - the most adorable pair of shoes and
the dreamiest new dress\\
372 - and I got the full treatment at
Phipps Beauty Salon.\\
373 - Well, I just felt like a new woman.\\
374 - If you'll excuse me,\\
375 - I'd like to show you what Phipps did
for me.\\
376 - Would you excuse me?\\
377 - Excuse me, darling.\\
378 - Certainly.\\
379 - And while my lovely wife has gone to
change\\
380 - to show you what Phipps did for her,\\
381 - I'd like you to meet our lovable and
wonderful neighbors,\\
382 - our very good friends, the Mertzes.\\
383 - Fred and Ethel!\\
384 - Good morning!	Hello!\\
385 - Good morning!\\
386 - Hello out there in TV land.\\
387 - And what have you two early birds
been up to?\\
388 - We've been shopping.\\
389 - Mm-hmm.\\
390 - You have been shopping?\\
391 - Yeah.\\
392 - Where?\\
393 - (tone plays on pitch pipe)\\
394 - Oh... when we go on shopping trips\\
395 - Where else would we go but Phipps?\\
396 - From the top floor to the bottom\\
397 - If it's bargains, Phipps has got them\\
398 - Down at Phipps, your credit's great\\
399 - Ask today for a Phipps-a-plate\\
400 - First on your list of shopping tips\\
401 - Put...\\
402 - (off-key): P-P-P\\
403 - P-h-i-p-p-s, Phipps.\\
404 - P-P-P...\\
405 - TAYLOR: Okay, that's great.\\
406 - Did you like it?\\
407 - Did I sound all right?\\
408 - Oh, you sounded marvelous.\\
409 - Well, I think that'll be enough
rehearsing for today.\\
410 - Oh, aren't we going to do the rest of
it?\\
411 - Oh, no. I don't want you to go stale.\\
412 - Oh.
Mr. Cromwell likes it\\
413 - to look unrehearsed, like you just
did.\\
414 - Oh.	  Yeah.\\
415 - Well, uh... look, I'm due down at the
club,\\
416 - so I'll see you all later.\\
417 - All right, darling.
Bye, honey.\\
418 - Bye, dear.
Oh, uh, everybody back here\\
419 - at 8:00 in the morning\\
420 - and we'll have a dress rehearsal
before we go on the air.\\
421 - Okay.
We'll be here.\\
422 - Wasn't that fun?\\
423 - Honey, I love the way you sounded.\\
424 - Your harmony was great. 	
Thanks. Bye.\\
425 - See you later, honey.\\
426 - Bye, sweetheart,\\
427 - Mr. Taylor, was the show really all
right?\\
428 - Is it really gonna be good?\\
429 - It looks great.\\
430 - In my opinion, we're gonna have a
hit.\\
431 - Oh, good.\\
432 - Mr. Cromwell certainly had a good
idea here.\\
433 - Mr. Cromwell?\\
434 - This was Ricky's idea.\\
435 - No, it was Mr. Cromwell's idea.\\
436 - Are you sure?\\
437 - Well, I was there when he thought of
it.\\
438 - Really?\\
439 - Yes.\\
440 - As a matter of fact,\\
441 - your husband didn't go for the idea.\\
442 - But Mr. Cromwell said it would be\\
443 - a Mr. And Mrs. Show or nothing.\\
444 - Oh, he said that, did he?\\
445 - Mm-hmm. Oh, well, we're all packed
up.\\
446 - Is it all right if we leave\\
447 - the equipment set up till tomorrow?\\
448 - Mm-hmm.\\
449 - Fine, thank you.
See you in the morning.\\
450 - Oh, and...
don't be nervous.\\
451 - You're going to be sensational.\\
452 - Thank you.\\
453 - Bye.\\
454 - Bye.\\
455 - (door shuts)\\
456 - Oh!\\
457 - (exasperated sigh)\\
458 - It...\\
459 - Oh, is Mr. Taylor gone?\\
460 - I wanted to ask him if he thought
this dress\\
461 - would look all right on television.\\
462 - What do you think?\\
463 - It's just perfect.\\
464 - You'll look like a test pattern.\\
465 - Well! What happened to you?\\
466 - I'll tell you what happened to me.\\
467 - Mr. Taylor just informed me\\
468 - that doing a Mr. and Mrs. Show was
not Ricky's idea at all!\\
469 - It wasn't?\\
470 - No, it was Mr. Cromwell's idea\\
471 - and Ricky tricked me because Mr.
Cromwell said\\
472 - it was a Mr. and Mrs. Show or
nothing!\\
473 - Ohh!\\
474 - Well! That's the end of this show for
me!\\
475 - I'm not going to do it.\\
476 - Oh, now, Lucy, if you don't do it,\\
477 - then none of us can be on it!\\
478 - That's too bad.\\
479 - But this is your big chance!\\
480 - Are you going to muff it?\\
481 - You can call me "Little Miss Muff
It"!\\
482 - Now, Lucy, that doesn't sound like
you at all--\\
483 - to quit, to walk out!\\
484 - Gee, if you were planning on\\
485 - going on the show and lousing it up,\\
486 - I could understand that,\\
487 - but I never heard you say\\
488 - you were gonna quit before or walk
out...\\
489 - Hey, hey, wait a minute, maybe you
got something there.\\
490 - Now, Lucy... Lucy, what are you going
to do?\\
491 - Maybe I won't want to be on the show.\\
492 - Oh, I won't do anything on the show,\\
493 - but I can give him a good scare at
dress rehearsal,\\
494 - and then he can apologize to me
before I do the show.\\
495 - TAYLOR: All right, everybody in their
places for dress rehearsal.\\
496 - Okay.
Go right there.\\
497 - Go behind the door there.
That's right.\\
498 - RICKY: Dress rehearsal now.\\
499 - Make it a real good one, eh?\\
500 - Okay.\\
501 - (whispering): It looks like we're
going to get away with it.\\
502 - They really think this is only a
dress rehearsal.\\
503 - Sure. I told you I was going to fool
them.\\
504 - I set every clock in the house back
one hour,\\
505 - Even the Mertzes clocks set back one
hour.\\
506 - Oh, that's great.\\
507 - They'll be so much more relaxed\\
508 - if they don't know they're on the
air.\\
509 - Sure.
Ooh, we're almost ready.\\
510 - Good luck, Ricky.\\
511 - Thank you.\\
512 - Now listen, everybody,\\
513 - I want to start our dress rehearsal
in just ten seconds.\\
514 - You ready?
Yes.\\
515 - I want you to go through the whole
thing from start to finish\\
516 - without stopping, just like we were
on the air.\\
517 - Don't stop for anything no matter
what happens.\\
518 - No matter what happens?\\
519 - No matter what happens.\\
520 - Okay, here we go.\\
521 - Phipps Department Store presents\\
522 - "Breakfast with Ricky and Lucy."\\

534 - Well, I'm not one to complain,\\
535 - but I had a miserable night.\\
536 - I was trying to sleep on a Phipps

537 - But dear, a Phipps Foam Mattress\\
538 - rocks you to sleep.\\
539 - You mean a Phipps Foam Mattress\\

550 - you made this one, eh?\\
551 - No, I didn't, dear.\\
552 - I had it sent over\\
553 - from Phipps Fountain and Tea Room.\\
554 - Food always tastes different\\
555 - when they fix it.\\
556 - I don't know what they do to it.\\
557 - Oh, girls...\\
558 - Girls, I want to tell you something
that happened to me.\\
559 - I got out of bed yesterday, feeling
real blah.\\
560 - Feel like a real slob.\\
561 - And then I went to Phipps\\
562 - and, boy, what they did to me.\\
563 - If you'll excuse me, I'd like to show
you what Phipps did for me.\\
564 - Excuse me?\\
565 - Will you excuse me, dear?\\
566 - Gladly.\\
567 - And while my lovely and wonderful
wife\\
568 - is going to change\\
569 - to show you what Phipps did for her,\\

Come in.\\
575 - Good morning!\\
576 - Hello, out there in TV land.\\
577 - And what have you two early birds
been up to?\\
578 - We've been shopping.
Mm-hmm.\\
579 - You have been shopping?\\
580 - Yeah!\\
581 - Where?\\
582 - Oh, when we go on shopping trips\\
583 - Where else would we go but Phipps?\\

591 - TAYLOR: Hold it, hold it, everybody!\\
592 - Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!\\
593 - Oh, boy, you should have seen your
face!\\
594 - (laughing)\\
595 - You think it's pretty funny, eh?\\
596 - Oh, yes, I do.\\
597 - And for your information,\\
598 - I found out why you were so grand\\
599 - and let me be on your program.\\
600 - Uh-huh.\\
601 - Uh-huh.\\
602 - Did they cut us off?\\
603 - Not until after she came out in that
getup.\\
604 - What are you talking about?
Who cut who off?\\
605 - What are you talking about?\\
606 - What happened?
Who cut who off?\\

\subsection {Episode 06: Ricky's Movie Offer}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Oh, boy, this kid's half-asleep
already.\\
3 - How you doing, Fred?\\
4 - I'm pretty near through.\\
5 - Hi, there, young fella.\\
6 - You know what, I think I got
something here for you.\\
7 - Hi.\\
8 - Hi. How do you like that?\\
9 - Garcie.\\
10 - Oh, he said gracias.\\
11 - No way.\\
12 - (laughing)\\
13 - He gets more like his father every
day.\\
14 - (Fred laughs)\\
15 - That was very nice, sweetheart.\\
16 - He's a little Cuban dandy all right.\\
17 - "Gracias."\\
18 - (whistling tune)\\
19 - Fred, I appreciate your concern over
our safety,\\
20 - but you haven't worried about it for
13 years.\\
21 - Why are you worrying now?\\
22 - Well, that was Ethel's idea.\\
23 - Oh.\\
24 - She saw in the paper where some crook
posed\\
25 - as a door-to- door salesman\\
26 - so he could get into apartments\\
27 - and then rob the place.\\
28 - I read that. I didn't think much
about it.\\
29 - Well, you know how she is.\\
30 - One little thing happens,\\
31 - and she thinks the sky is falling.\\
32 - (chuckles)\\
33 - Most door-to-door salesmen I've met
are very honest.\\
34 - Mm-hmm, well, I know it and you know
it,\\
35 - but try and tell it to Chicken
Little.\\
36 - (laughing)\\
37 - Oh, dear, what a gal, what a gal.\\
38 - (grunting)\\
39 - There we are, yeah.\\
40 - There, now you got a brand-new,
burglar-proof chain.\\
41 - Thank you, Fred.\\
42 - You just broke through Fred's
burglar-proof chain.\\
43 - Fred, can't you ever do anything
right?\\
44 - "Fred, can't you ever do anything
right?"\\
45 - You're not supposed to come charging
in there\\
46 - like a bull out of a chute.\\
47 - If you'd have fixed it right, it
wouldn't have pulled out.\\
48 - With your weight, you could come\\
49 - through that wall without a door.\\
50 - Oh, keep quiet or I'll sit on you.\\
51 - I'll go down to the basement\\
52 - and see if I can find some bolts
strong enough to hold that\\
53 - against the charge of the heavy
brigade.\\
54 - Okay, Fred.\\
55 - Do that, and fix every door\\
56 - in every apartment in this building.\\
57 - (falsetto): "Do that and fix every
door in every apartment\\
58 - in this building." I'm gonna do that.\\
59 - How come you're such a scaredy-cat
all of a sudden?\\
60 - Oh, listen, people are going around,\\
61 - posing as all sorts of things just to
get into apartments.\\
62 - They posing as reporters and salesmen
and who knows what.\\
63 - Didn't you read this article in the
paper this morning?\\
64 - Yeah, I read it, but I didn't think
much about it.\\
65 - Well, I'm never gonna let anybody in
my door again.\\
66 - What happens if I want to come over?\\
67 - What's the password?\\
68 - Never mind. You still want me to
baby-sit\\
69 - while you go to the dentist?\\
70 - The dentist!\\
71 - I forgot all about the dentist!\\
72 - Oh, for heaven's sake,\\
73 - it took me three weeks to get the
appointment.\\
74 - Oh, gosh, how do you like that?\\
75 - I'll be back in an hour.\\
76 - Okay.\\
77 - I have read all of his magazines.\\
78 - There, that ought to do it.\\
79 - Oh, Fred, those big bolts look awful.\\
80 - Can't you make it look a little
neater?\\
81 - What are you talking about?\\
82 - A couple of dabs of paint and you'll
never notice it.\\
83 - Anyway, this protects you against
anything.\\
84 - Why be half-safe?\\
85 - Oh...\\
86 - Fred, it's stuck.\\
87 - Fred...\\
88 - Fred!\\
89 - Fred!!!\\
90 - What are you trying to do, be funny
or something?\\
91 - Lock that thing and then call me
back?\\
92 - I called you back to tell you that
the lock got stuck.\\
93 - It's impossible for that lock to get
stuck.\\
94 - Well, it did get stuck.\\
95 - I couldn't open it.
Come on, I'll show you.\\
96 - The lock can't get stuck.\\
97 - Oh, humbug.\\
98 - I'll go down and get some new tools.\\
99 - Yeah, and fix it right this time.\\
100 - This is a lot of protection.\\
101 - (sighing)\\
102 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
103 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
104 - Yes?\\
105 - Good afternoon.
Is Mr. Ricardo home?\\
106 - Why?\\
107 - Well, I have an appointment with him.\\
108 - Oh, you have?\\
109 - Well, yes.\\
110 - Are you Mrs. Ricardo?\\
111 - Uh, who wants to know?\\
112 - My name is Benjamin, Ben Benjamin,\\
113 - and I have an appointment\\
114 - with Mr. Ricardo.\\
115 - Uh, well, uh, he's not at home right
now.\\
116 - But...
(door slamming)\\
117 - Madam...\\
118 - Would you mind if I come in and wait?\\
119 - Yes, I would mind.\\
120 - Who are you, anyway?\\
121 - What do you want?\\
122 - Well, I happen to be a talent scout\\
123 - for motion pictures.\\
124 - A talent scout, ha!\\
125 - That's a good one.\\
126 - Well, now, look, lady, I am a talent
scout.\\
127 - That's a new one.
Nobody's...\\
128 - I'm telling you, I have an
appointment...\\
129 - (screaming): Fred!!!\\
130 - Stop your screaming, will you?!\\
131 - Cut it out!
Don't scream!\\
132 - (Ethel screaming)\\
133 - Oh, thank goodness, Lucy, you got
here just in time.\\
134 - He really tried to break in, huh?\\
135 - Oh, I'll say he did.\\
136 - He said he was a talent scout from
Hollywood.\\
137 - And you wouldn't believe that article\\
138 - in the paper this morning.\\
139 - Well, I believe it\\
140 - now that I see what he did to that
door.\\
141 - Oh. Well...\\
142 - I'm going to call the police.\\
143 - (phone ringing)
Yes, call the police.\\
144 - Oh. Hello?\\
145 - Oh, Ricky, I'm glad you called.\\
146 - Listen, something just... What?\\
147 - Well, well, honey, my-my news is
important, too.\\
148 - Now, listen, just... well, I...\\
149 - Oh, all right, go ahead.\\
150 - A talent scout is coming here\\
151 - to see you this afternoon, and...\\
152 - he's going to talk to you\\
153 - about a picture in Hollywood?\\
154 - His name is Benjamin?\\
155 - Um... uh...
well, honey, don't worry.\\
156 - I'll, I'll take care of him till you
get here.\\
157 - Yeah, good-bye... What?\\
158 - My news?\\
159 - Uh, spilled the milk all over.\\
160 - The baby, the baby!\\
161 - Oh...\\
162 - Ethel, what's the matter with you?\\
163 - I'm sorry, Lucy.\\
164 - No time to be sorry.\\
165 - Ricky called from the drugstore down
there.\\
166 - He'll be here any minute.\\
167 - What do we do with poor Mr. Benjamin?\\
168 - Oh, set him up on there.\\
169 - Oh, yeah, put him up on there.\\
170 - (straining)\\
171 - He said he was a talent scout.\\
172 - I didn't believe he was a talent
scout.\\
173 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
174 - (both muttering at once)\\
175 - Oh! Shall we lie him down, Lucy?\\
176 - No! Sit him up.\\
177 - Sit him up? Why?\\
178 - I don't want him to know\\
179 - that I'm the one that hit him.\\
180 - It'll be the end of Ricky's career in
pictures,\\
181 - to say nothing of mine.\\
182 - Yours?!\\
183 - Now, listen, when he wakes up,\\
184 - we'll just be sitting here naturally,\\
185 - talking to him, you know,\\
186 - and-and we'll pretend we don't know\\
187 - what he's talking about\\
188 - when he says somebody hit him on the
head.\\
189 - That's a great idea.\\
190 - Okay, all right.\\
191 - Help me clean this up.\\
192 - Oh, cleaning, oh, Lucy.\\
193 - My gosh, look at this.\\
194 - (gasping)\\
195 - Couldn't you have got something else
to hit him with?\\
196 - Ricky'll think the baby did it.
Oh, dear.\\
197 - Here, straighten out his hat.\\
198 - Okay, straighten out his hat.\\
199 - I'll hang up his coat.\\
200 - Oh, good, right there on the stool.\\
201 - Mr. Benjamin?
Where'd he go?\\
202 - Mr. Benjamin?\\
203 - Oh, he fell off again.\\
204 - Oh!\\
205 - (muttering): Oh...\\
206 - Wait a minute, now, wait.\\
207 - (grunting)\\
208 - (grunting)\\
209 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
210 - Oh, let's see, now.\\
211 - Uh, let's see...\\
212 - Let's make him look kind of natural.\\
213 - Let's see...
there, yeah.\\
214 - Let's see if he smokes.\\
215 - Yeah.\\
216 - His hair's mussed up.\\
217 - Comb his hair.\\
218 - Comb his hair.\\
219 - Hey, Lucy, look.\\
220 - Was it parted in the middle?\\
221 - It was parted on this side.\\
222 - Hurry up.\\
223 - The hair looks better than when he
came in, huh?\\
224 - Okay, sit down.\\
225 - Sit down!\\
226 - Sit back and relax.\\
227 - Oh, okay.\\
228 - (gasps)\\
229 - Oh, my dear, do you mean to tell me\\
230 - that Elizabeth Taylor looks just as
pretty\\
231 - off the screen as she does on?\\
232 - Huh?\\
233 - You were saying, Mr. Benjamin,\\
234 - that Elizabeth Taylor looks just as
pretty\\
235 - off the screen as she is on, is that
right?\\
236 - Uh... yes. Yes.\\
237 - Oh, well, I'm so glad to hear that.\\
238 - I like to hear nice things about
Hollywood.\\
239 - Who are you?\\
240 - Who am I?\\
241 - (guffawing)   (guffawing)\\
242 - Oh, surely you must be joking, Mr.
Benjamin\\
243 - or my name isn't Lucy Ricardo.\\
244 - Oh, so then you're Mrs. Ricardo.\\
245 - Oh, you silly boy, of course.\\
246 - I don't understand this.\\
247 - When I came in...\\
248 - (groaning)\\
249 - What's the matter?\\
250 - I have an awful headache.\\
251 - Oh, too bad.\\
252 - Look, when I first came in here,\\
253 - didn't you scream and...\\
254 - Scream?\\
255 - Why, why should I scream?\\
256 - Uh, you know, dear, you did call me.\\
257 - You said, "Lucy!" And then I came out\\
258 - and hung up Mr. Benjamin's coat and
hat\\
259 - and, uh, since then we've just been
sitting here\\
260 - having a delightful chat with you,
Mr. Benjamin.\\
261 - Hi, honey.
You really...\\
262 - Oh, hi, dear.\\
263 - Mr. Benjamin came in right after you
called.\\
264 - Oh, he-hello, Mr. Benjamin, how are
you?\\
265 - All right.\\
266 - ETHEL: Well, good-bye, Mr. Benjamin.\\
267 - It's just been delightful talking to
you.\\
268 - Good-bye.
Thank you.\\
269 - Eh, Mr. Benjamin, my-my agent says\\
270 - that you want to see me about a
screen test.\\
271 - A screen...?\\
272 - Oh, oh, yes, yes.\\
273 - Our-our studio is making a picture\\
274 - about the life of Don Juan.\\
275 - Don Juan!\\
276 - Oh, Ricky, that'd be just perfect for
you.\\
277 - Spanish and everything.\\
278 - Lucy...\\
279 - Yes, dear.\\
280 - Mr. Benjamin, that-that sounds very,
very exciting.\\
281 - Is it going to be cinemascopee and
stereonophic?\\
282 - I beg your pardon?\\
283 - Is it going to be cinemascopee and
stereonophic?\\
284 - Uh... uh...
Mr. Benjamin,\\
285 - I think he means "cinemascope"\\
286 - and "stereophonic."\\
287 - That's what I said.\\
288 - That's what he said.\\
289 - Oh. Probably, I...\\
290 - Oh, that's good.\\
291 - You know, I'm sorry, but I don't feel
very well.\\
292 - I have an awful headache.\\
293 - Oh, that's too bad.\\
294 - Look, I, uh, I have a script here
with me.\\
295 - There's a scene in it here somewhere
that's marked.\\
296 - You can find it.\\
297 - If you'll just read that over\\
298 - and I'll be back in a couple of days.\\
299 - You can read it for me,\\
300 - and then if it sounds all right,
we'll give you a screen test.\\
301 - Well, that would be wonderful, Mr.
Benjamin.\\
302 - I'm awfully happy\\
303 - to have met you, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
304 - Thank you. I'll get your coat, sir.\\
305 - I'll be seeing you, then, in a couple
days.\\
306 - Yes, sir.\\
307 - Okay, Ricky.\\
308 - Here you are, sir.\\
309 - Thank you.\\
310 - Bye.\\
311 - He's nice fellow.
Too bad he's got a headache.\\
312 - Well, those things come on you, you
know.\\
313 - Sometimes you just don't know what
hit you.\\
314 - Yeah. That's too bad.\\
315 - "Yes, it is I, oh, lovely one.\\
316 - "Would that I had the power to tell
you\\
317 - what is in my heart tonight."\\
318 - "Yes, it is I, oh, lovely one.\\
319 - "Would that I had the power to tell
you\\
320 - what is in my heart tonight."\\
321 - Would that you had the power\\
322 - to read that speech right.\\
323 - What's wrong with it?\\
324 - The same thing I've been telling you
all day.\\
325 - You're just too stiff, Ricky.\\
326 - You have to loosen up.
Relax!\\
327 - Not that much.\\
328 - Don Juan was a man, not an ape.\\
329 - Now, look, you're getting me all
mixed up.\\
330 - I am not.\\
331 - It's just that you can't just stand
there\\
332 - and just say the words.\\
333 - In pictures, you have to be a
personality.\\
334 - You have to develop a distinctive way
of talking\\
335 - like Humphrey Bogart.\\
336 - Oh! Oh, yeah, I see what you mean.\\
337 - (as Bogart): "Yes, it is I, oh,
lovely one."\\
338 - (Lucy groans)\\
339 - "Drop the gun."\\
340 - Oh, now, stop.
Now you know what I mean.\\
341 - Look, will you leave me alone?\\
342 - I've been in show business a long
time.\\
343 - Doesn't make you an actor\\
344 - just because you've been shouting
"babalu"\\
345 - and beating on a cowhide.\\
346 - Oh, yeah?\\
347 - Yeah.\\
348 - Who do you think you are, Sarah
Bernhardt?\\
349 - I don't have to be Sarah Bernhardt\\
350 - to tell you a few things!\\
351 - Hey, what's going on?
What's the matter?\\
352 - Oh, I'm trying to make an actor out
of him,\\
353 - but he just refuses.\\
354 - She keeps telling me to do things
that I know are wrong.\\
355 - They are not!\\
356 - Well, what do you want him to do?\\
357 - Well, for one thing, I'd like him to
develop\\
358 - a distinctive way of speaking.\\
359 - Ricky?! 	Ricky?!\\
360 - You know what I mean.\\
361 - I'll show you what she wants me to
do.\\
362 - Go ahead, sit down, I'll show you.\\
363 - Sit down, honey.\\
364 - Huh!\\
365 - Here's what she wants me to do:\\
366 - "Would that I could ask you to fly
with me\\
367 - "for I know that you are devoted\\
368 - to your husband, Count Lorenzo."\\
369 - "It is you I love, my lover.\\
370 - "You are so young and strong,\\
371 - but he is old and feeble and he needs
me."\\
372 - "But for him, I will sweep you into
my arms\\
373 - "and carry you over yon garden wall.\\
374 - Oh, my heart...
my poor, poor heart."\\
375 - "What of your heart?"\\
376 - "It sinks."\\
377 - FRED: That's not the only thing.\\
378 - Now, you shut up.\\
379 - I told you it was lousy.\\
380 - Oh, I don't think you should've\\
381 - taken her on your arms like that.\\
382 - Ricky, I've been in show business a
long, long time.\\
383 - If you'd take a little advice from
people\\
384 - who've had a lot of experience...\\
385 - All right, all right!\\
386 - You're not doing what I told you.\\
387 - All right, already!\\
388 - Will you please do me a favor\\
389 - and leave me alone?\\
390 - Oh, now, Ricky.\\
391 - I want to do it my way.\\
392 - Oh, fine.\\
393 - (mimicking): "Would that I had the
power\\
394 - to take you and fly over yon garden
wall." Right?\\
395 - That would be great.\\
396 - I was just trying things out.\\
397 - That's not the way I'm going to do
it.\\
398 - Yeah.\\
399 - Now, out, everybody.\\
400 - Oh, Ricky...\\
401 - Maybe if you can take a little
advice...\\
402 - Please go play cards or something.\\
403 - I got a lot of work to do now.\\
404 - Will you please go and play cards?\\
405 - (still protesting)
Thank you very much.\\
406 - Can't do it like "Babalu."\\
407 - Thank you very much for your
interest.\\
408 - Phew!\\
409 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
410 - "Yes, it is I, oh, lovely one.\\
411 - "Would that I had the power to tell
you\\
412 - "what is in my heart tonight.\\
413 - "Would that I could ask you to fly
with me\\
414 - "but I know that you are devoted to
your husband, Count Lorenzo.\\
415 - "But for him, I would sweep you into
my arms\\
416 - "and lift you over yon garden wall.\\
417 - "Oh, my heart, my poor, poor heart.\\
418 - To think it can never be one with
yours."\\
419 - No, no, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sawyer.\\
420 - Yes, dear, it's true.\\
421 - A talent scout is coming over
tonight,\\
422 - but it's only to listen to Ricky.\\
423 - No, I'm sure he wouldn't be
interested\\
424 - in your French poodle.\\
425 - You see, this is a Spanish picture.\\
426 - (laughing)\\
427 - Yes, that's right.\\
428 - Okay, good-bye.\\
429 - Hi.\\
430 - Honestly, this has been going on all
morning.\\
431 - What has?\\
432 - People calling up and wanting to
audition tonight.\\
433 - No kidding.\\
434 - How did they find out?\\
435 - I don't know. I didn't tell anybody--
did you?\\
436 - Certainly not.
I didn't tell a soul\\
437 - and they all promised to keep it a
secret.\\
438 - You know, I never knew this
neighborhood\\
439 - was so full of frustrated performers.\\
440 - At last I found out where vaudeville
went to die.\\
441 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
442 - Oh, no! Now, who is this?\\
443 - Oh, Mrs.
Trumbull.\\
444 - Hello, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
445 - I'm returning that cup of sugar\\
446 - that I borrowed from you.\\
447 - Oh, fine. Well, come in and sit down.\\
448 - (raspy-voiced): Ah, sweet mystery of
life\\
449 - At last I've found you\\
450 - Ah, at last I know the meaning of
hope\\
451 - Oh, the yearning, seeking,
striving...\\
452 - Mrs. Trumbull, dear...\\
453 - (stops singing)\\
454 - Did you by any chance hear\\
455 - that a talent scout was coming here
tonight?\\
456 - Yes, I did hear a little rumor.\\
457 - Yes. Well, you have a very lovely
voice, dear,\\
458 - but this gentleman is coming here
tonight\\
459 - just to hear Ricky read for the lead
in Don Juan.\\
460 - Nothing ventured, nothing gained.\\
461 - That's right.\\
462 - Mrs. Ricardo, I'll just take back
that sugar.\\
463 - Oh.\\
464 - Oh, I thought you were returning it.\\
465 - Oh, I didn't really owe it to you.\\
466 - That was... just a ruse.\\
467 - Oh, oh.\\
468 - Ah, sweet mystery of life\\
469 - At last I've found you...\\
470 - Isn't she a doll?\\
471 - (doorbell buzzing)
She sure is.\\
472 - Oh, the back door.\\
473 - Next they'll be coming through the
windows.\\
474 - Oh, hi, Pete.\\
475 - Hi, Mrs. Ricardo.
Hi, Mrs. Mertz.\\
476 - Oh, uh, say, Mrs. Ricardo...\\
477 - Before you say another word, Pete,\\
478 - it's a Spanish picture\\
479 - and there is no room in it for
whatever you do.\\
480 - What are you talking about?\\
481 - I was just going to tell you we're
all out of melon.\\
482 - Oh, I'm sorry, Pete.\\
483 - It's just that everybody in the
neighborhood\\
484 - has been calling up and wanting to
audition\\
485 - for a talent scout that's coming here
tonight.\\
486 - Oh, I hadn't heard a word about it.\\
487 - Well, good.\\
488 - But now that you mention it, I do
play the trumpet.\\
489 - Just forget it.\\
490 - But Mr. Ricardo, when I play the
trumpet, I'm real gone.\\
491 - Then go, man, go.\\
492 - Honestly.\\
493 - Isn't it awful?\\
494 - After all, Ethel,\\
495 - if there are any extra parts in that
picture,\\
496 - you and I could certainly...\\
497 - Ethel, what's wrong with us?!\\
498 - I don't know.\\
499 - Cast of characters-- I never even
thought\\
500 - to look at it.		No.\\
501 - "Don Juan, the count, the countess"--\\
502 - they'll be the stars.\\
503 - Now, look, here, here we are.\\
504 - "Isabella, a beautiful peasant girl,\\
505 - a Marilyn Monroe type."\\
506 - That's perfect!\\
507 - Of course.\\
508 - Is there a part for you?\\
509 - I was referring to me.\\
510 - You? I'm the blond in this group.\\
511 - Well, I could be a blond as easy as
you can.\\
512 - Oh, now, listen,\\
513 - the minute you said it was a Marilyn
Monroe...\\
514 - She has a way of carrying herself\\
515 - and a way of smiling.\\
516 - Hey, what's the beef?\\
517 - Wait, here's Fred.
We'll let him settle it.\\
518 - Fred, I think I look more like
Marilyn Monroe than Lucy does.\\
519 - And I think I look more like Marilyn
Monroe than Ethel does.\\
520 - What do you think?\\
521 - I think I look more like her than
either one of you.\\
522 - Oh, Fred, you're a big help.\\
523 - What's all this about, anyway?\\
524 - Well, we were just looking at this
script\\
525 - and there may be parts for all of us
in it.\\
526 - And one of them is a Marilyn Monroe
type.\\
527 - Now, so I said I'd...\\
528 - Oh, for Pete's sake,\\
529 - can't you two let Ricky do one little
thing\\
530 - without horning in?\\
531 - Can't you live your life without
putting your nose in...\\
532 - Part for all of us?\\
533 - Now, look, Fred,\\
534 - Fred, you were right.
You were right.\\
535 - This is Ricky's big chance and I
think\\
536 - we should keep completely out of it.\\
537 - Huh? Don't you, Ethel?\\
538 - Uh... oh, yeah.\\
539 - Yes.\\
540 - Yes, we'll let Ricky do this all by
himself.\\
541 - Yes, this is Ricky's big day.\\
542 - Let's let him have it, huh, okay?\\
543 - Okay.\\
544 - Okay?\\
545 - Okay.\\
546 - Okay.\\
547 - Lucy?\\
548 - Lucy?\\
549 - LUCY: I'll be right there.\\
550 - Hey, what time is that talent scout\\
551 - supposed to arrive?\\
552 - Lucy said he'd get here around 7:30.
Sit down.\\
553 - Hey, who are you supposed to be?\\
554 - Guess.\\
555 - FRED: Humphrey Bogart in a wig.\\
556 - What are you two all dressed up for?\\
557 - We're a Spanish dance team.\\
558 - (humming song from Carmen)\\
559 - All right, okay, hold it.\\
560 - I thought we all agreed\\
561 - that you weren't going to do anything\\
562 - to ruin Ricky's chance.\\
563 - Well, you're ruining it.\\
564 - That's different, I'm his wife, I
have a right to ruin it.\\
565 - Well, that's a pretty selfish
attitude to take.\\
566 - Where is Ricky?\\
567 - He's down picking up Mr. Benjamin.\\
568 - Now, listen, you two, get out of
here.\\
569 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
570 - There he is.\\
571 - Sit down and be quiet.\\
572 - (singing "L'amour")\\
573 - (playing Spanish melody)\\
574 - Pete, Pete!\\
575 - What do you think you're doing?\\
576 - Who are you supposed to be?\\
577 - Gorgeous George.\\
578 - Now, look, Pete, there's no point in
your...\\
579 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
580 - There he is.\\
581 - Sit down and be quiet, will you?\\
582 - (Ethel singing song from Carmen)\\
583 - (Pete playing Spanish melody)\\
584 - Ay-ay-ay-ay...\\
585 - Ay-ay-ay-ay...\\
586 - Canta y no llores\\
587 - Porque cantando se alegran...\\
588 - Mrs. Trumbull...\\
589 - Cielito lindo...\\
590 - Mrs. Trumbull, the talent scout isn't
here yet.\\
591 - Oh, nuts.\\
592 - Now, listen, everybody, there's no...\\
593 - (phone ringing)\\
594 - La, la, la, la la, la, la, la\\
595 - Hold it, hold it.\\
596 - Hold it, hold it!\\
597 - Hold it!
It's the phone.\\
598 - Hello.\\
599 - Honey, guess what happened.\\
600 - What happened?\\
601 - He's gonna give me a screen test.\\
602 - Well, what do you mean?\\
603 - Mr. Benjamin isn't even here yet.\\
604 - I know, I read for him at his hotel.\\
605 - At his hotel?\\
606 - Yeah. He said he had a terrible
headache.\\
607 - Has he still got a headache?\\
608 - Isn't that wonderful news?\\
609 - Honey, I got the screen test!\\
610 - Yeah, honey, wonderful.\\
611 - Anything new at home?\\
612 - No, dear, everything here is about as
usual.\\
613 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
614 - ANNOUNCER: I Love Lucy is a Desilu
Production.\\
615 - Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz\\
616 - will be back next week at this same
time.
\subsection {Episode 07: Ricky's Screen Test}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - You are going to learn to sing and
dance and act,\\
3 - and then when Daddy takes us out to
Hollywood,\\
4 - we're going to be a big star, too,\\
5 - just like Jackie Coogan, huh, honey?\\
6 - Now, first you have to learn how to
dance.\\
7 - Now, you watch Mama.\\
8 - Hey, watch me, watch me.\\
9 - Come on now, watch.\\
10 - First you're gonna learn how to
dance.\\

16 - You try it.\\
17 - Oh, just try.\\
18 - (mutters)\\
19 - Come on now, try.\\
20 - Da, da, ta, da, ta\\
21 - Da, da, ta, da, ta\\
22 - Da, da, ta, da, ta...\\
23 - Oh, come on, honey, just try to
dance, huh?\\
24 - You won't dance, huh?\\
25 - Well, dancing isn't so important.\\
26 - It's the acting that counts, huh?\\
27 - Let's try the different emotions,
shall we?\\
28 - Now, first, sadness.\\
29 - You are sad.\\
30 - You are so sad.\\
31 - (imitates little Ricky fussing)\\
32 - You lost your lollipop.\\
33 - That's good, that's good.\\
34 - Yeah, that's good.\\
35 - You won't dance, though, huh?\\
36 - (fussing)\\
37 - I don't understand it, Ricky.\\
38 - Both your parents are so talented.\\
39 - Well, hey, wait a minute.\\
40 - Maybe if you put on a funny hat,\\
41 - you'll go into your stuff, huh?\\
42 - Oh, come on, honey.\\
43 - Okay.\\
44 - You want to go out and play with Mrs.
Trumbull?\\
45 - All right!\\
46 - Okay, honey.\\
47 - Well, yeah, you'll find your place in
show business, huh?\\
48 - Yeah.\\
49 - Well, we'd love to come to your
party, Marge,\\
50 - if we're still in town.\\
51 - Oh, haven't you heard?\\
52 - Yeah, Ricky's going to Hollywood and
be a big movie star.\\
53 - Lucy...\\
54 - Yeah, yeah. They're giving him a
screen test this week,\\
55 - and then he's gonna sign the
contract,\\
56 - and California, here we come!\\
57 - (laughs)\\
58 - Well, sure, you can visit us, Marge.\\
59 - Sure!\\
60 - Well, we'll talk to you before we
leave.\\
61 - Bye!\\
62 - Honey, why do you keep telling people\\
63 - that we're going to Hollywood\\
64 - when you know it's not definite yet?\\
65 - Well, it will be.\\
66 - Now, look, the screen test might not
be any good.\\
67 - Aah!
And even if it is,\\
68 - I still might not get the part.\\
69 - Oh!\\
70 - And then, and then ev-even if I get
the part,\\
71 - there're still a lot of things that
can happen\\
72 - to keep me from being a Hollywood
star.\\
73 - Now, look, you're just being
negative.\\
74 - I believe in positive thinking.\\
75 - You're going to take Hollywood by
storm.\\
76 - Well, look, ju-just forget the whole
thing, will you?\\
77 - If it happens, all right,\\
78 - but until then, let's not count on
it.\\
79 - All right, dear, anything you say.\\
80 - Good.\\
81 - Where do you think we ought to live?\\
82 - Hollywood or Beverly Hills?\\
83 - I was merely asking.\\
84 - Well, this is hardly the time that we
have to decide that.\\
85 - Yeah, you're right, it doesn't matter
where we live.\\
86 - The important thing is to find
someone\\
87 - that can build us a swimming pool\\
88 - shaped like a conga drum.\\
89 - Hi!\\
90 - Hi.\\
91 - Hi, Ethel.\\
92 - Did you bring your bathing suit?\\
93 - Huh?\\
94 - Lucy just invited us all to go for a
swim in our pool.\\
95 - Oh, is she still entertaining in her
Beverly Hills mansion?\\
96 - Go, ahead, laugh.\\
97 - You two have no vision.\\
98 - I can see us out there in Hollywood
now,\\
99 - dining in famous restaurants,\\
100 - rubbing elbows with movie stars,\\
101 - Ricky putting his footprints in the
cement\\
102 - in the forecourt at Grauman's Chinese
Theatre.\\
103 - She's been out in that California sun
too long.\\
104 - Gee, it'll be such fun dropping into
Romanoff's or the Derby\\
105 - and seeing all the old gang.\\
106 - Hi, Bing!\\
107 - Oh, Luella, darling!\\
108 - (affected laugh)\\
109 - LUCY: Oh, Hedda, I adore that hat!\\
110 - Hi!
Hi!\\
111 - I brought back the butter I borrowed.\\
112 - Thank you. Come here!
I want to show you something\\
113 - I found in this movie magazine.\\
114 - What?\\
115 - A map of Hollywood showing where
the.... all the stars live\\
116 - and guess what.     What?\\
117 - There's a vacant lot right next to
Clark Gable's.\\
118 - Lucy, I haven't got time for this.\\
119 - All right, but when you come to visit
us,\\
120 - I won't let you borrow butter from
Clark.\\
121 - Where's the lot?\\
122 - Right here.\\
123 - Now, look, all the stars live in this
section, see,\\
124 - and that's where we're gonna have to
live, too, honey.\\
125 - Oh, Lucy! Do you really think you're
gonna get to go?\\
126 - I have no doubt of it!\\
127 - We were meant for Hollywood, Ethel.\\
128 - It's sort of, sort of our destiny.\\
129 - Yeah. Hey, maybe Clark will let Ricky\\
130 - ride to the studio with him every
morning.\\
131 - Oh, honey, movie stars don't ride to
work\\
132 - with other movie stars.\\
133 - They don't?\\
134 - No. we'll get our own big, yellow
Cadillac convertible.\\
135 - Oh, pardon me!\\
136 - Alan Ladd lives right here.\\
137 - Yeah.		Alan Ladd!\\
138 - Hey, look, look!\\
139 - Ricky made front page in Variety!\\
140 - No kidding!	    Yeah.\\
141 - "Ricky Ricardo, local nightclub
entertainer,\\
142 - "is testing for the lead in Don Juan.\\
143 - "Studio heads revealed today\\
144 - "that the Latin American conga beater\\
145 - seems to have the inside track for
the role."\\
146 - What did I tell you? We're as good as
in Hollywood right now.\\
147 - "The studio is earmarking $3 million\\
148 - "for the budget for the star-studded
color spectacle."\\
149 - Color!\\
150 - $3 million!\\
151 - Maybe we'll have two Cadillacs marked
"his" and "hers."\\
152 - "The studio plans to select a
newcomer like Ricardo\\
153 - "for the lead and build him into a
star.\\
154 - He will be surrounded by big-name
performers."\\
155 - Oh, isn't that wonderful!\\
156 - "Being considered for top female
roles around him\\
157 - "are Marilyn Monroe, Ava Gardner,
Jane Russell,\\
158 - Yvonne DeCarlo, Lana Turner, Arlene
Dahl, Betty Grable..."\\
159 - Oh, boy!
What a lineup!\\
160 - I say!\\
161 - Hey! Hey, did you read Variety?\\
162 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
163 - They say I got a pretty good chance.\\
164 - And what a cast!\\
165 - Nothing but cuties and beauties!\\
166 - Yeah, I know. They say I got the
inside track!\\
167 - ETHEL: Oh, Ricky, this is so
exciting!\\
168 - RICKY: Y-You know, for the, for the
first time,\\
169 - I-I'm beginning to feel like Lucy
does, you know,\\
170 - that we're really destined to go to
Hollywood!\\
171 - Yeah!	    Yeah!\\
172 - Honey, I think that\\
173 - your instincts are very good!\\
174 - Yeah, well, uh, Ricky...\\
175 - Yeah, honey?\\
176 - You know, you, uh, you have a very
steady following\\
177 - here in New York.\\
178 - Do you think it's wise to give up a
sure thing\\
179 - for the uncertainty of a film career?\\
180 - Huh?\\
181 - Lucy, I thought you were dying to go
to Hollywood\\
182 - and rub elbows with the stars.	  
Yeah.\\
183 - Well, it's an awful lot of wear and
tear on your elbows.\\
184 - What about me putting my footprints\\
185 - in Grauman's Chinese Theatre?\\
186 - Get your shoes all covered with wet
cement?\\
187 - Nah.\\
188 - What about living next door to Clark
Gable?\\
189 - Now, don't tell me that's bad.\\
190 - Well, Ethel, look at it this way.\\
191 - Suppose you do borrow butter from
Clark.\\
192 - What good will it do you?\\
193 - He'll give you one look\\
194 - and it'll melt right in your hand.\\
195 - I don't get it, Lucy, why the big
switch?\\
196 - Wait a minute, wait a minute.\\
197 - I think I know.\\
198 - Would this change of heart have
anything to do with, uh...\\
199 - Marilyn, Ava, Jane, Yvonne, Arlene
and Betty?\\
200 - Certainly not!\\
201 - And you left out Lana.\\
202 - I thought so.\\
203 - The green-eyed monster.\\
204 - Oh, Lucy, the paper said\\
205 - they were just considering those
girls.\\
206 - Yeah, well.\\
207 - In other words, you just as soon I
didn't get the part, huh?\\
208 - Well...\\
209 - frankly, yes.\\
210 - Oh, Lucy, how small can you be?!\\
211 - Well, I just can't help it!\\
212 - Well, honey, if you really feel that
way,\\
213 - then it's no use going through with
the screen test.\\
214 - Lucy, you're not gonna let him give
up his big chance?\\
215 - Of course she isn't!\\
216 - Aah!\\
217 - I'll call Mr. Benjamin\\
218 - and I'll tell him that I'm not
interested\\
219 - in going through with the screen test\\
220 - and neither are you.\\
221 - Well, I think that's better, Ricky.
I...\\
222 - I think that that's the only...\\
223 - What do you mean, neither am I?\\
224 - What do you mean, neither am I?!\\
225 - Well, I... Well, no use telling you
now.\\
226 - Tell me what, tell me what, tell me
what!\\
227 - Well, it's just that the girl that
was supposed\\
228 - to do the test with me got sick, and
Mr. Benjamin asked\\
229 - if I knew somebody who could take her
place.\\
230 - So what'd you tell him?
What'd you tell him?\\
231 - I told him you've been reading the
part with me\\
232 - and you knew it cold and he said
you'd be fine.\\
233 - He did?\\
234 - Yeah, but if you don't want me to do
it, I'll call him...\\
235 - Honey, wait just a minute now.\\
236 - Wait just a minute now.\\
237 - Let's, let's not be rash.\\
238 - A-After all, dear,\\
239 - this-this is your big chance to go to
Hollywood.\\
240 - No, honey, I think you're right.\\
241 - After all, I got a steady following\\
242 - and a sure thing right here in New
York.\\
243 - Yeah, well, th-that's just it.\\
244 - You're in a rut, a big fat rut!\\
245 - An-And I think what you need\\
246 - is the, is the, is the, th-the
challenge\\
247 - of-of an unknown field.\\
248 - The next sound you hear will be Clark
Gable\\
249 - opening his refrigerator.\\
250 - Now, honey, I want you to be
absolutely sure\\
251 - because the only thing that is
important\\
252 - is where we'll be the happiest.\\
253 - Oh, honey, how can there be any doubt
of it?\\
254 - Who wouldn't love to go to Hollywood?\\
255 - Dining in famous restaurants,\\
256 - mingling with celebrities\\
257 - and don't you worry, dear,\\
258 - I'll wipe that cement off your shoes
before it dries.\\
259 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
260 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
261 - Ethel, will you answer that door? I'm
busy.\\
262 - Busy? Doing what?\\
263 - Reading.\\
264 - Oh, honestly!\\
265 - What are you made up for, Lucy?\\
266 - Oh, darn it!\\
267 - You recognized me!\\
268 - What is this, trick or treat?\\
269 - How'd you know who it was?\\
270 - Well, for one thing, I've seen that
old link stole every winter\\
271 - for the last eight years.\\
272 - Oh, dear.\\
273 - Well, if I hadn't worn this, would
you have known who it was?\\
274 - Of course! What are you trying to
prove?\\
275 - Well, I was just practicing.\\
276 - You know, us movie stars have to go
around disguised\\
277 - or our fans will mob us.\\
278 - (chuckling)\\
279 - Why, if it isn't Lucy Ricardo.\\
280 - Gee, can I have your autograph?\\
281 - Oh, Fred, don't be smart.\\
282 - Who's being smart?\\
283 - I want it on a check for this month's
rent.\\
284 - You'll get your money, my good man.\\
285 - Us movie stars always pay our bills.\\
286 - ETHEL: Hey, wait a minute.\\
287 - I thought Ricky was gonna be the
star.\\
288 - Oh, he'll be one, too, don't worry.\\
289 - Too?\\
290 - Yeah. I was just thinking.\\
291 - Do you know what's liable to happen
with that screen test?\\
292 - What? I'm afraid to ask.\\
293 - Well, now, it just might happen sort
of like this.\\
294 - We make the test here in New York.\\
295 - They send it out to the coast.\\
296 - They show it at the studio.\\
297 - My face comes on the screen\\
298 - just for an instant, but that's
enough.\\
299 - The head of the studio sees it.\\
300 - He jumps up and shouts:\\
301 - "That face! That face!\\
302 - Get me that girl!"\\
303 - "Sir, she's an unknown, a nobody."\\
304 - "I don't care; find her.\\
305 - "Get that girl!
I want to make her a star!"\\
306 - And the rest is motion picture
history.\\
307 - Ethel, that girl could be a second
John Bunny.\\
308 - Hi.\\
309 - Oh, hi, Rick.\\
310 - Oh, there you are.\\
311 - I came home early; I want to go over
that scene that...\\
312 - What's all that?\\
313 - That's Lucy's disguise so her fans
won't know she's a star.\\
314 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
315 - You know, Fred, I married a bird.\\
316 - (chuckling): Yes.\\
317 - She's just supposed to help me out in
this screen test\\
318 - and she's already a big movie star.\\
319 - Well, don't hold your breath, honey.\\
320 - Apparently, you're not up on your
motion picture history.\\
321 - What are you talking about?\\
322 - Well, the way I hear it...\\
323 - Come on, dear,\\
324 - let's go do that scene.\\
325 - Just a minute, please.\\
326 - Come back here.\\
327 - What are you talking about, Fred?\\
328 - Well, the way I hear it,\\
329 - the head of the studio sees your
test,\\
330 - discovers Lucy,\\
331 - he demands to know her name\\
332 - and a new star is born!\\
333 - (chuckling)\\
334 - So, that's the way it's gonna happen,
huh?\\
335 - I didn't say it would happen; I said
it might.\\
336 - Well, it could happen.\\
337 - Better not happen?\\
338 - Look, Lucy, there are a few things
that you ought to know.\\
339 - First of all, this test is for me.\\
340 - You're just there to feed me the
lines.\\
341 - Nobody's going to see any more than
the back of your head.\\
342 - Now, I'm going to go home\\
343 - and get into some comfortable clothes\\
344 - and I'll 'spect you there in five
minutes\\
345 - to go over that scene. Huh!\\
346 - (door opening)\\
347 - (door slamming)\\
348 - "I'll "spect" you there in five
minutes to go over that scene."\\
349 - "You're just there to 'fid' me the
lines."\\
350 - "No one's going to see anything but
the back of your head."\\
351 - Huh! That's what he thinks!\\
352 - Lucy, what are you going to do?\\
353 - I don't know, but the back of my head\\
354 - isn't going to take this lying down!\\
355 - (whistling)\\
356 - Yes?	Now, Ricky...\\
357 - Ricky, we'll shoot the song part of
the test first.\\
358 - Okay.
Are the guitar players\\
359 - close enough for balance?\\
360 - I think so, yes.\\
361 - All right, I'm ready.\\
362 - (shouting): Quiet on the set!\\
363 - This is a take!\\
364 - (quietly): It's all yours, sir.\\
365 - Roll 'em.\\
366 - (shouting): Roll 'em!\\
367 - Speed!\\
368 - MAN: Ricardo's song, take one!\\

371 - Bajo el manto plateado de un sombrero
Cordobes\\
372 - Unos ojos van brindando la ternura de

notas sonar\\

mirar\\

395 - Cut!\\
396 - (applause)\\
397 - Print that.\\
398 - Print it, the first take.\\
399 - Ricky, perfect.\\
400 - Now we'll do the scene.\\
401 - All right, thank you, boys.\\
402 - Thank you very much.\\
403 - All right, get Mrs. Ricardo.\\
404 - Yes, sir.\\
405 - Now, Ricky, when you kneel down at
the end of the scene,\\
406 - you know, make a more dramatic wave
with the hand when you say,\\
407 - "So, I'm afraid that we must say
farewell,"\\
408 - and then make your exit.\\
409 - Oh, I see. Okay.\\
410 - Uh, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
411 - Oh, oh, is that the camera?\\
412 - Yes.\\
413 - Mrs. Ricardo...\\
414 - Yes, sir.\\
415 - We'll rehearse it once more before we
shoot.\\
416 - Action.\\
417 - Hark!\\
418 - Do I hear a footfall?\\
419 - Is that you, Don Juan?\\
420 - Yes, it is I, oh, lovely one.\\
421 - Would that I had the power\\
422 - to tell you what is in my heart
tonight.\\
423 - What do you mean, my dearest?\\
424 - I have come to say farewell.\\
425 - No, say not so.\\
426 - Would that I could ask you to fly
with me,\\
427 - but I know that you're devoted\\
428 - to your husband, Count Lorenzo.\\
429 - Yes. Much as I love you, I must stay
with him.\\
430 - He is old and feeble and he needs me.\\
431 - But for him, I would sweep you into
my arms\\
432 - and carry you over yon garden wall.\\
433 - Oh, that I could cut these ties that
bind me.\\
434 - Do not cry, my dearest.\\
435 - It was not meant to be.\\
436 - I had no right to win your heart.\\
437 - I had no chance to win your love.\\
438 - So, now I'm afraid I must say
farewell.\\
439 - Cut!\\
440 - That's fine, Ricky, fine.\\
441 - Good feeling.\\
442 - Thank you.
How was I, sir?\\
443 - Very good, Mrs. Ricardo.
Thank you.\\
444 - Oh, Ricky, now, be careful so that\\
445 - your wife doesn't get in your way in
front of the camera.\\
446 - Just take a step to one side.\\
447 - All right.	Well, I think\\
448 - we're about ready for a take.\\
449 - Now, let's see if we can't get this
the first time, everybody.\\
450 - Now, may I have it quiet, please?\\
451 - (shouting): Quiet on the set!\\
452 - This is a take!\\
453 - (quietly): It's, uh, all yours, sir.\\
454 - Uh, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
455 - Roll 'em.\\
456 - (shouting): Roll 'em!\\
457 - Speed!\\
458 - Ricardo test, take one!\\
459 - (screaming)\\
460 - What was that?!
Cut!	What was that?!\\
461 - That's just what we have to do at the
beginning of a scene.\\
462 - Oh.	    Now...\\
463 - Now, please, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
464 - Now, uh...\\
465 - change the slate.\\
466 - All right, I'm ready.\\
467 - (shouting): Quiet on the set!\\
468 - This is a take!\\

tonight.\\

482 - No, say not so.\\
483 - Cut!\\
484 - Lucy, what's the matter with you?\\
485 - DIRECTOR: Mrs. Ricardo...\\
486 - Yes, sir?\\
487 - Is that as far as your head turns?\\
488 - Yes. Why?\\
489 - What a pity. I thought it might lend
interest\\
490 - to the scene if you could keep it
going around and around\\
491 - like a lighthouse!\\
492 - Oh... (laughs)\\
493 - I don't recall telling you to look
over your shoulder.\\
494 - Oh, no, sir, that was my own idea.\\
495 - Did you like it?\\
496 - No!	      Oh.\\
497 - Now, let's just do this the way we
rehearsed it.\\
498 - Yes, sir.\\
499 - Let me check this setup again.\\
500 - Lucy, what are you trying to do?\\
501 - Well, I was just thinking,\\
502 - the back of my head is not my best
side.\\
503 - That's only one person's opinion!\\
504 - All right, now, places, everybody!\\
505 - All right, I'm ready.\\
506 - (shouting): Quiet on the set!\\
507 - This is a take!\\
508 - (quietly): Yes, sir.\\
509 - Roll 'em.\\
510 - Roll 'em!\\
511 - Speed!\\
512 - Ricardo test, take three!\\
513 - DIRECTOR: Action!\\
514 - Hark! Do I hear a footfall?\\
515 - Is that you, Don Juan?\\
516 - Yes, it is I, oh, lovely one.\\
517 - Would that I had the power\\
518 - to tell you what is in my heart
tonight.\\
519 - What do you mean, my dearest?\\
520 - Would that I could ask you to fly
with me.\\
521 - But I-I know that you're devoted\\
522 - to your husband, Count Lorenzo.\\
523 - But for him, I would sweep you into
my arms\\
524 - and carry you over yon garden wall.\\
525 - Oh, that I could cut these ties that
bind me!\\
526 - Cut!!\\
527 - Well, we can't use the scene, but it
was a lovely mazurka!\\
528 - I'm sorry, sir.\\
529 - My wife doesn't seem to understand.\\
530 - Well, I hope she catches on this time\\
531 - because this is going to be the last
take!\\
532 - Why, you running out of film?\\
533 - No. No, we're running out of chalk!\\
534 - Oh.\\
535 - Now shall we do it for the last time?\\
536 - Look, I'm sorry, sir.\\
537 - You want to get another girl?\\
538 - You expect me to go around looking
for another girl\\
539 - with a whole crew sitting around here
getting paid!\\
540 - No, no, no, sir, no.\\
541 - No, we should put a three-inch lens
on,\\
542 - then we'll take it with that!\\
543 - Now, this is the test that's going to
Hollywood.\\
544 - Yeah, well, I-I-I got, I got an idea\\
545 - that this time it's going to be
right!\\
546 - All right. Now, this is it,\\
547 - good, bad or indifferent!\\
548 - (shouting): Roll 'em!\\
549 - Roll 'em, I said!\\
550 - Oh.\\
551 - Roll 'em.\\
552 - Roll 'em!\\
553 - Speed!\\
554 - Ricardo test, take four.\\

557 - Is that you, Don Juan?\\
558 - Yes, it is I, oh, lovely one.\\
559 - Would that I had the power\\
560 - to tell you what is in my heart
tonight.\\
561 - What do you mean, my dearest?\\
562 - I have come to say farewell.\\
563 - No... no, say not so.\\
564 - I am sorry, my dear,\\
565 - but this is the way it has to be!\\
566 - Would that I could ask you to fly
with me,\\
567 - but I know that you're devoted to
your husband,\\
568 - your husband, Count Lorenzo.\\
569 - Yes, much as I love you, I must stay
with him.\\
570 - He is old and feeble, and he needs
me.\\
571 - But for him, I would carry you\\
572 - over yon garden wall\\
573 - and lift you over the wall.\\
574 - Oh, that I could cut these ties that
bind me.\\
575 - Do not cry, my dearest.\\
576 - It was not meant to be.\\
577 - I had no right to win your heart.\\
578 - I had no chance to win your love.\\
579 - So, now I must say farewell!\\
580 - DIRECTOR: Cut!\\
581 - Okay.\\
582 - Okay, that's it.\\
583 - What do you mean, that's it?\\
584 - You're not gonna send that to
Hollywood?\\
585 - Don't worry, I had a close-up lens on
you.\\
586 - All we ever saw was your face.\\
587 - Didn't see your wife at all.\\
588 - RICKY: You sure it was all right?\\
589 - Sure, it'll be fine.\\
590 - Okay, everybody, that's it, wrap it
up.\\
591 - You hungry, Ricky?\\
592 - Yeah.\\
593 - Put on your pants\\
594 - and I'll buy you some lunch, come on.\\
595 - Okay.\\
596 - Well, hey, wait for me!\\
597 - Wait for me, Mr. Director Man!\\
598 - Uh, Ricky... Ricky, it was only a

the screen test?\\
14 - No, Hollywood didn't call.\\
15 - It has nothing to do with the screen
test.\\
16 - Oh.	    I just happened\\
17 - to be downtown shopping and I thought
I'd drop by\\
18 - and bring you a letter that came this
morning.\\
19 - Oh.	  It's special delivery.\\
20 - I thought it might be important.\\
21 - Well, that's very sweet of you,
honey,\\
22 - but you could have called me\\

24 - Please, I do not approve of reading
other people's mail.\\

26 - Besides, it was all in Spanish.\\

A date...\\
91 - The date is the sixth of August.\\
92 - Why, Rick...\\
93 - Oh, you told him when my birthday
was.\\
94 - No, honey, I just met him.\\
95 - Go on now, you told him.\\
96 - Let's try something else.\\
97 - Tell me something\\
98 - that no one else could possibly know.\\
99 - All right.\\
100 - I know something that even Ricky
doesn't know.\\
101 - A nickname when I was in grade
school...\\
102 - I'm thinking of a name, Professor.\\
103 - A name...\\
104 - A nickname...\\
105 - One she used when she was in grade
school.\\
106 - Th-The name is... Bird Legs!\\

your head.\\
110 - He wasn't really reading your mind.\\
111 - But he knew all those things!\\
112 - Of course.\\
113 - I know. They do it, uh...
with electro-knicks.\\
114 - "Electro-knicks"?\\
115 - I think he means electronics.\\
116 - Oh.\\
117 - Yeah, that's it.
That's what I said.\\
118 - Yes, we do the act with a shortwave
setup, you see?\\
119 - Here is the receiver.\\
120 - And I have the microphone here.\\
121 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
122 - Then he really heard what I tol...
oh.\\
123 - Of course.
Isn't that clever?\\
124 - Well, Professor, that's a wonderful
act.\\
125 - We'll buy it. You can start tomorrow

140 - Hi.\\
141 - Hi.\\
142 - "Carne de puerco con chile vurdy."\\

144 - I'm going through this Cuban
cookbook.\\
145 - You know, according to Ricky,\\
146 - his mother thinks I'm the best cook\\
147 - and housekeeper in the whole wide
world.\\
148 - Oh, brother.\\
149 - When is she coming?\\
150 - I don't know; she's gonna wire us
ahead of time.\\
151 - Well, when do you start the
housecleaning?\\
152 - Oh, I wasn't going to do anything
special.\\
153 - The apartment's all clean.\\
154 - Honey, your mother- in-law is coming!\\
155 - Stand by for dust inspection.\\
156 - Oh, Ethel, you don't think\\
157 - Ricky's mother is coming all the way
up from Cuba\\
158 - just to check on my housekeeping?\\
159 - Why not? Fred's mother comes all the
way\\
160 - from Indiana once a year just to look
under my rug!\\
161 - Oh-ho-ho-ho!\\
162 - Oh, brother,\\
163 - if I thought she'd stay home,\\
164 - I'd send her the rug and a box of
dirt.\\
165 - (laughing)\\
166 - Oh, I don't think Ricky's mother is
like that.\\
167 - Honey, a mother-in-law is a
mother-in-law.\\
168 - Don't take any chances.\\
169 - You know what she'll do.\\
170 - She'll open every drawer,\\
171 - She'll go through all the closets.\\
172 - She'll go under the bed, over the
transom,\\
173 - all around the picture frames.\\
174 - Oh, Ethel...\\
175 - I'm telling you.\\
176 - Really? 		Mm.\\
177 - FRED: Ethel!\\
178 - What?\\
179 - Where's my lunch?\\

getting out of a cab.\\
187 - H-H-How do you know it's Ricky's
mother?\\
188 - She tried to pay the cab driver in
pesos.\\
189 - And she looks like those pictures you
showed me.\\
190 - Well, here, help me put this stuff
back in the closet.\\
191 - (muttering): Oh...\\

when they're coming,\\
194 - they never do!\\

196 - Oh, for heaven's sake!\\
197 - I didn't expect her for a week!\\

349 - ?Como te gusta Lucy?\\
350 - Dile a Lucy que es exactamente lo que
esperaba.\\
351 - Mother says that you're just the way
she pictured you.\\
352 - Well, thank you.
You tell her\\
353 - She's just like I pictured her, too.\\
354 - She looks just like you.\\
355 - Lucy dice que tu y yo nos parecemos.\\
356 - Gracias.\\
357 - Mother says, "Thank you."\\
358 - You are welcome.\\
359 - Lucy dice, "No hay de que."\\
360 - Dile a Lucy que mi nieto parece un
angelito.\\
361 - Aw. She says that little Ricky looks
just like an angel.\\
362 - Oh... gracias.\\
363 - Lucy, uh, Lucy says, "Thank you."\\
364 - You... are... welcome.\\
365 - Mama dice, "No hay de que."\\
366 - I got my fingers crossed.\\
367 - I'm talking to you in Spanish\\
368 - and talking to mother in English.\\
369 - You got your wires crossed.\\
370 - My wires or something crossed.\\
371 - I don't know what it was.\\
372 - Hey, what's burning, honey?\\
373 - My-my dinner.\\
374 - Your dinner?\\
375 - What happened?\\
376 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
377 - RICKY: Uh-oh.
Oh, no, don't tell me...\\
378 - Oh, no!\\
379 - Oh, no! Oh...\\
380 - Look at it!\\
381 - Ay, que lastima, Lucita!\\
382 - But that's all right, honey.
We'll eat it anyway.\\
383 - It's just little charcoal taste,
that's good.\\
384 - Hi.\\
385 - Hi.\\
386 - What are you doing tonight?\\
387 - Nothing in particular. Why?\\
388 - Want to run away with me?\\
389 - Run away?\\
390 - What's the matter?\\
391 - Oh, Ethel, I haven't done anything
right\\
392 - since Ricky's mother came to visit
us.\\
393 - Oh, honey, you have, too.\\
394 - I have not.\\
395 - The day she arrived, the apartment
was a mess,\\
396 - my hair was up in curlers,\\
397 - the closet exploded in her face\\
398 - and I burned the dinner.\\
399 - Yes, I know, hon....\\
400 - And then the next day, I took her
shopping\\
401 - and I lost her in the subway.\\
402 - (sniffling)\\
403 - But someone turned her in to lost and
found.\\
404 - Sure.\\
405 - She must think I'm an awful dope.\\
406 - I wouldn't be surprised if she had
our marriage annulled.\\
407 - Nothing that's happened has been your
fault.\\
408 - Now, you march back in there and
you...\\
409 - No, I can't.\\
410 - Why not?\\
411 - Well, his... his mother\\
412 - has some friends coming over to see
her tonight\\
413 - and I offered to press her dress for
her.\\
414 - Well?\\
415 - After the annulment, you can come and
live with us.\\
416 - (wailing)\\
417 - I didn't mean it, honey.\\
418 - I was only joking.\\
419 - Please, don't make jokes.\\
420 - You're the only English-speaking
friend I've got.\\
421 - Oh, honey...\\
422 - I just wish there was some way\\
423 - that I could walk into that group
tonight\\
424 - and start speaking Spanish.\\
425 - Well, you could always give the party
down at the United Nations\\
426 - and use their earphones and an
interpreter.\\
427 - Oh, sure.\\
428 - Oh, honey, you got to get hold of
yourself.\\
429 - I never saw you so upset.\\
430 - Hey!
What?\\
431 - You have given me a tremendous idea!\\
432 - Oh, honey, I'm sure the United
Nations\\
433 - has more important things to do.\\
434 - No, no, there's a new act down at the
club\\
435 - and they use hidden earphones and a
hidden microphone.\\
436 - I could, I could borrow the earphones\\
437 - and somebody could be in the kitchen,\\
438 - telling me what to say in Spanish!\\
439 - Don't look at me.
I don't speak Spanish.\\
440 - No, no, but that professor does!\\
441 - I'm going to call him and ask him if
he'll help me.\\
442 - Ricky and his mother went down to
pick up the guests.\\
443 - They're not back yet.	Mm-hmm.\\
444 - Now, look, can you see that?\\
445 - No.\\
446 - Does it show in my ear?\\
447 - No, no, no.
It's all right.\\
448 - Can you see the wire?\\
449 - No, I don't.
Okay.	    It's fine.\\
450 - But are you sure Mrs. Mertz will let
me know if my...\\
451 - if my phone call comes in?\\
452 - Oh, sure, she'll tell you as soon as
she gets it.\\
453 - Oh, fine.
What's so important?\\
454 - Well, it's my daughter.\\
455 - Tonight I may become an abuelo!\\
456 - A what?\\
457 - Abuelo. Grandfather.\\
458 - And I want to know when it happens.\\
459 - Well, of course you do.\\
460 - Congratulations.
Don't worry.	    Thank you.\\
461 - She'll call you.\\
462 - Now, you watch through here, listen
to what they say\\
463 - and tell me what to say in Spanish.\\
464 - Don't worry.\\
465 - Go slowly.
Go slowly.    Oh, yes.\\
466 - Want to try it once?	Yeah.\\
467 - Okay, say something.\\
468 - Muy bien, gracias.\\
469 - Muy bien, gracias.\\

489 - Well, I-I was out taking a Spanish
lesson.\\
490 - Spanish lesson!\\
491 - Uh-huh. I want to be able\\
492 - to talk to your mother and her
friends.\\
493 - Well, honey, that's awfully sweet,\\

one lesson.\\

\subsection {Episode 09: Ethel's Birthday}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - (both screaming)\\
3 - Ahh!\\
4 - Ethel, what's the matter with you?\\
5 - Are you crazy or something?\\
6 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
7 - Come sneaking in on somebody like
that.\\
8 - Well, I wanted to be sure\\
9 - Fred wasn't here before I came in.\\
10 - Well, for heaven's sake, why?\\
11 - I want you to help me with something.\\
12 - What?\\
13 - Well...\\
14 - I don't know whether I mentioned it
or not,\\
15 - BOTH: But I've got a birthday coming
up...\\
16 - ...this week.\\
17 - Oh, did I mention it?\\
18 - Only about 18 times\\
19 - in the last three days.\\
20 - Oh. Well, Fred doesn't seem to have
gotten my message.\\
21 - Where has he been, underwater?\\
22 - Will you help me?\\
23 - Well, okay.\\
24 - I just hope he gives you something
nicer\\
25 - than he gave you last year.\\
26 - Wasn't that awful?\\
27 - You know, I never did figure out\\
28 - what that was supposed to be.\\
29 - Neither did I.\\
30 - It was too long to be a stole\\
31 - and too short to be a volleyball net.\\
32 - You know, on second thought, Ethel,\\
33 - maybe we'd better keep Fred from
finding out\\
34 - it's your birthday.\\
35 - No, I'd rather have a terrible
present\\
36 - than no present at all.\\
37 - You're right, it's not the gift that
counts,\\
38 - it's the lack of thought behind it.\\
39 - I'm glad you're gonna help me.\\
40 - Hey, why don't you and Fred come over
for dinner tonight.\\
41 - We'll both work on him.\\
42 - and I'll be real subtle, see?\\
43 - Oh, that ought to do it. Thanks.\\
44 - Okay.
I'll see you later.\\
45 - All right.\\
46 - Good.\\
47 - You want some more cake, Fred?\\
48 - No, thanks.\\
49 - Um, speaking of cake,\\
50 - did you all see the huge birthday
cake\\
51 - that was in the window of the Speedy
Cleaners?\\
52 - It was the Speedy Cleaners' 40th
birthday.\\
53 - LUCY: Mm-hmm.\\
54 - Oh... and I didn't send them
anything.\\
55 - Goldblatt's Delicatessen had a
birthday last week.\\
56 - It was their 50th.\\
57 - It just seems like everybody in the
neighborhood\\
58 - is having a birthday.\\
59 - Let's see, who else do we know\\
60 - that has a birthday about this time?\\
61 - Can I have another cup of coffee,
Lucy?\\
62 - Yeah.\\
63 - You know, I have the strangest
feeling\\
64 - that someone we all know and love\\
65 - has a birthday coming up very soon.\\
66 - Someone's going to get clobbered\\
67 - if he doesn't remember.\\
68 - Excuse me, please.\\
69 - Want some sugar, Fred?\\
70 - No, thanks.\\
71 - Cream?\\
72 - No, thanks.\\
73 - Happy birthday, sweetheart!\\
74 - (laughing)\\
75 - You thought I'd forgotten, eh?\\
76 - My birthday is months from now.\\
77 - Oh?\\
78 - She was talking about Ethel's
birthday.\\
79 - Oh, Fred, you knew it all the time.\\
80 - Sure.\\
81 - Why did you let us\\
82 - keep on talking?\\
83 - Yeah. What's the matter with you.,
Fred?\\
84 - I just wanted to see how far\\
85 - you two clowns would go.\\
86 - I'll put this away.\\
87 - Just a minute.\\
88 - How come you have this box of candy\\
89 - all ready to give to me?\\
90 - Well, uh...\\
91 - And with a card\\
92 - that says "Happy Birthday"?\\
93 - Ricky?\\
94 - Well, uh...\\
95 - if you must know...\\
96 - this is my emergency present.\\
97 - (laughing)\\
98 - Emergency present, huh?\\
99 - "Happy Anniversary."\\
100 - "Happy Mother's Day."\\
101 - "Happy Valentine's Day."\\
102 - "Merry Christmas."\\
103 - Oh, and here's a pip.\\
104 - "I'm sorry, dear.\\
105 - Can't we please be friends again?"\\
106 - (laughing)\\
107 - Well, I'll...
I'll put it away.\\
108 - Why? I certainly won't be surprised
next time.\\
109 - You might be.\\
110 - These chocolates are three years old.\\
111 - That's great, Rick.\\
112 - I'll have to remember that gag.\\
113 - Honestly, these men.\\
114 - What, uh, birthday is it, Ethel?\\
115 - Ethel, what birthday is it?\\
116 - Oh, it's mine.\\
117 - I meant, how old are you gonna be?\\
118 - She know what you meant.\\
119 - Ricky Ricardo, I'm surprised at you.\\
120 - It's not nice to ask a woman's age.\\
121 - Thanks, Lucy.\\
122 - Besides, it's none of your business\\
123 - if Ethel is 53.\\
124 - I am not!\\
125 - I'm only...\\
126 - Oh, no, you don't.\\
127 - Ha, ha! Darn it, it almost worked.\\
128 - Ah, you think you're so smart.\\
129 - I'll never tell you my age.\\
130 - I'll tell you.\\
131 - Fred Mertz, don't you dare.\\
132 - Go ahead, tell us.\\
133 - Fred!\\
134 - Nah, honeybunch, I'm not going to
tell them your exact age.\\
135 - Let's just say it's somewhere between
the Speedy Cleaners\\
136 - and Goldblatt's Delicatessen.\\
137 - (guffawing)\\
138 - Well, so long as you know\\
139 - I got a birthday coming up,\\
140 - where had you planned to take me to
celebrate?\\
141 - Well, I loved what we did\\
142 - last year, honeybunch.\\
143 - What was that, Fred?\\
144 - Well, we just had a cozy little
dinner\\
145 - at home, just the two of us.\\
146 - That's sounds very romantic.\\
147 - Oh, it was.\\
148 - I bought the groceries,\\
149 - I cooked the dinner,\\
150 - and by the time I finished washing
the dishes,\\
151 - he was in front of the television set
asleep.\\
152 - (guffawing)\\
153 - Happy birthday to me.\\
154 - I tell you what let's do this year.\\
155 - Let's all go someplace for a fancy
dinner\\
156 - and then go to the theater and see a
play.\\
157 - Oh, that'd be wonderful.\\
158 - Would you like that?
I'd love it.\\
159 - I don't think that's a very good
idea.\\
160 - Fred, it'll be our present to Ethel.
It's on us.\\
161 - Yeah.\\
162 - Hey, that is a pretty good idea.\\
163 - Oh, what a sport I married.\\
164 - Okay, then that's all settled.\\
165 - Come on, let's play cards.\\
166 - That was quite a game.\\
167 - Yeah.\\
168 - Thanks for a wonderful dinner, Lucy.\\
169 - You're welcome.\\
170 - And, Ricky, thanks in advance\\
171 - for dinner and the theater on my
birthday.\\
172 - That's a wonderful present.\\
173 - Well... you're welcome.\\
174 - Hey, Fred, you know a present\\
175 - you can give me sometime?\\
176 - What?\\
177 - You can fix that leaky faucet in the
kitchen.\\
178 - Oh, how long has that been leaking
now?\\
179 - Four months now.\\
180 - Ah, don't worry.\\
181 - I'll get around to it in due time.\\
182 - Oh, swell.\\
183 - ETHEL: Come on. Good night, Rick.\\
184 - Good night, honey.\\
185 - Good night, Rick.
Good night, honey.\\
186 - Good night, Fred.
Good night.\\
187 - Oh, honey, I'm real tired.\\
188 - I think I'll go to bed, huh?\\
189 - Okay. I'll be right in.\\
190 - (sighing)\\
191 - (knock at door)\\
192 - Fred.\\
193 - Now, where's that little old leaky
faucet?\\
194 - At this hour?\\
195 - Well, it was on my mind.\\
196 - This is just an excuse to get away
from Ethel.\\
197 - Oh, oh, oh.\\
198 - Will you do me a favor?\\
199 - Sure, Fred.\\
200 - I want you to buy Ethel's present for
me.\\
201 - Oh, sure, I can, but why don't you
want to do it?\\
202 - Well, she doesn't seem to like the
presents I buy.\\
203 - What makes you say that?\\
204 - Well, I've been buying her presents
for 26 years now,\\
205 - and after I give them to her, I never
see them again.\\
206 - Well...\\
207 - Now, you buy her something real nice,
will you?\\
208 - With this?\\
209 - Well, all right.\\
210 - Okay, did she give you any hints
about what she wanted?\\
211 - Well, she did say this morning she
needed a new toaster.\\
212 - Oh, Fred.\\
213 - Women don't like practical gifts like
toasters.\\
214 - They like something that's feminine
and fun.\\
215 - You know, a gifty gift.\\
216 - Well, I'll leave the whole thing to
you.\\
217 - Oh, all right.
I'll go shopping tomorrow.\\
218 - I'll get her something real pretty,
huh?\\
219 - Thank you, honey.
Good night.\\
220 - Good night.\\
221 - Forgot my wrench.\\
222 - Hey, uh, as long as you're here,\\
223 - how about fixing the faucet?\\
224 - At this hour?\\
225 - Are you crazy?\\
226 - Psst, Fred, Fred.\\
227 - Hi.\\
228 - Shh.\\
229 - Oh.\\
230 - (whispers): There.\\
231 - Well, hi, Fred.\\
232 - Hi, Lucy.\\
233 - Hey, Ricky got tickets for Over The
Teacups.\\
234 - I don't believe it.\\
235 - He did; go on up and see him.\\
236 - Here I go.
Ethel?\\
237 - Yeah.\\
238 - Hi! I thought I heard your voice out
here.\\
239 - Guess what play Ricky got tickets
for.\\
240 - What?\\
241 - Over The Teacups.\\
242 - Over The Teacups!\\
243 - Oh, that's the biggest hit in town.\\
244 - How did he do that?\\
245 - Well, he said he had to pull a lot of
strings,\\
246 - but nothing was too much trouble for
your birthday.\\
247 - Oh, he's a dear.\\
248 - He's a real Cuban doll.\\
249 - This is gonna be the best birthday of
my whole life.\\
250 - Dinner and a hit play.\\
251 - Oh...\\
252 - What's the matter now?\\
253 - I haven't got a thing to wear.\\
254 - Oh, come now, Ethel.\\
255 - Surely you must have something.\\
256 - Well, I got a dress that would do,
but my coat's so tacky.\\
257 - What coat do you usually wear?\\
258 - Yours, but you're going.\\
259 - What about that gold lame jacket of
yours?\\
260 - You mean that green lame jacket of
mine?\\
261 - Tarnished?\\
262 - It's tarnished.\\
263 - Maybe you can get it dry-cleaned.\\
264 - Or I could polish it.\\
265 - Ha, ha!\\
266 - You wouldn't believe\\
267 - what that old coat looks like.
I'll show you.\\
268 - You know how many years I've had it
anyway.\\
269 - Hey.\\
270 - What's this?\\
271 - What's what?\\
272 - This.\\
273 - Oh, it must be Fred's present to me.\\
274 - How do you know?\\
275 - He always hides them in the closet.\\
276 - Must be something to wear.\\
277 - Uh, well, Ethel, uh...\\
278 - aren't you going to peek inside and
see what it is?\\
279 - No, I want to postpone the bad news
as long as possible.\\
280 - Well, uh, Ethel,\\
281 - may-maybe Fred got you something nice
this time.\\
282 - Let's look.\\
283 - Well... all right.\\
284 - Maybe if I get the initial shock over
with,\\
285 - I can act pleased when I open it in
front of Fred.\\
286 - Yeah.\\
287 - Well, he's done it again.\\
288 - What do you mean?\\
289 - Oh, these make his other presents
look great.\\
290 - Well, Ethel, I-I think they're kind
of cute.\\
291 - What are they?\\
292 - Well, they're hostess pants.\\
293 - You wear them when you give smart
dinner parties.\\
294 - Oh, I was wondering what to wear\\
295 - at all those smart dinner parties I
give.\\
296 - Well, I-I saw them last month in
Harper's Bazaar.\\
297 - Well, they're certainly bizarre.\\
298 - Well, now, wait a minute, Ethel.
Look.\\
299 - You get yourself a little black,
off-the-shoulder blouse\\
300 - and a big crushy belt and little
ballet slippers\\
301 - and you're all set.\\
302 - What for? Halloween?\\
303 - Well, I like them.\\
304 - I think this time Fred made a very
good choice.\\
305 - Oh, don't try to defend him, Lucy.\\
306 - Let's face it, all of his taste is in
his mouth.\\
307 - Ethel, I think you're being very
ungrateful!\\
308 - Fred pro-probably put a lot of time
and thought\\
309 - into picking these out.\\
310 - He did not.\\
311 - I know where they came from.\\
312 - What I can't figure out\\
313 - is how they got them to fit in a box
of Crackerjack.\\
314 - (chuckling)\\
315 - (laughing out loud)\\
316 - You know, these are so ridiculous,
they're funny.\\
317 - (guffawing)\\
318 - Oh, brother.\\
319 - I'd like to meet the idiot that
talked him into these.\\
320 - (guffawing)\\
321 - How do you do.\\
322 - How do you do.\\
323 - What do you mean?\\
324 - For your information,\\
325 - I am the idiot who talked him into
those.\\
326 - Oh, Lucy!\\
327 - Oh, Lucy, I don't believe it.\\
328 - I should have known more\\
329 - than to get you something chic.\\
330 - Chic?\\
331 - I got no use for those.\\
332 - I wanted a toaster.\\
333 - Well, Fred told me that,\\
334 - but I couldn't believe you could be
that dull.\\
335 - Listen, I'd look better wearing a
toaster\\
336 - than I wear those checkerboard
britches.\\
337 - I should have known better than to
get you anything\\
338 - at the young, modern department.\\
339 - Well, you're so young and modern, you
wear them.\\
340 - Well, I would, but first,\\
341 - I'd have to take them in six inches
in the seat!\\
342 - Oh!\\
343 - Well, honeybunch,\\
344 - you're going to the theater\\
345 - for your birthday.\\
346 - Yes, sir, it was tough, but we got
the tickets.\\
347 - Well, you little Dickens,\\
348 - you've opened your present.\\
349 - What did I give you?\\
350 - I mean, how do you like what I gave
you?\\
351 - Oh, it's not use, Fred.\\
352 - I know Lucy picked them out.\\
353 - You should have stuck with your own
taste.\\
354 - You see, I told you we should\\
355 - have bought the toaster.\\
356 - Is this what you bought for Ethel?\\
357 - You keep out of this!\\
358 - Well, this is a switch.\\
359 - You open your present,\\
360 - find out you don't like it,\\
361 - and now you can exchange it\\
362 - before I even give it to you.\\
363 - Yeah, this way,\\
364 - everything works out perfectly.\\
365 - Yeah, but I'll bet\\
366 - you won't want to exchange these.\\
367 - No, I won't because we're not\\
368 - going to accept them.\\
369 - What?\\
370 - I refuse to go to the theater with
anyone\\
371 - who thinks I'm a hippopotamus.\\
372 - Did you call her that?\\
373 - No.\\
374 - Ha!\\
375 - All I did was intimate\\
376 - that she was a little hippy.\\
377 - But on second glance,\\
378 - she has got the biggest potamus I've
ever seen.\\
379 - Fred, give him back those tickets.\\
380 - Are you crazy? They cost $6.60
apiece.\\
381 - I don't care if they cost $660.\\
382 - We're not going.\\
383 - Well, I am.\\
384 - Well, take somebody else.\\
385 - Hey, there's an idea.\\
386 - Oh, no you don't.\\
387 - There.\\
388 - We offered you theater tickets and
you're going to take them.\\
389 - We're not going.\\
390 - What?!\\
391 - I have no intentions\\
392 - of going to the theater\\
393 - with someone who thinks my taste is
all in my mouth.\\
394 - Pardon me.\\
395 - Happy birthday,\\
396 - and I hope you live another 75 years.\\
397 - Oh!\\
398 - Hi, Rick.\\
399 - Hi, Fred.\\
400 - There-- Ethel won't use these
tickets.\\
401 - Oh, that's too bad.\\
402 - Did you ever see anybody as stubborn\\
403 - as that old mule of mine?\\
404 - Well, Lucy does pretty good.\\
405 - She wasn't gonna go if Ethel was
going.\\
406 - Well, I'll let you know how the play
turns out.\\
407 - You won't have to.\\
408 - Ethel's got this thing stuck in her
craw.\\
409 - She's got to go to this play on her
birthday\\
410 - and I've got to buy some other
tickets.\\
411 - You can't buy any other tickets,
Fred. It's a sellout.\\
412 - Hey, wait a minute.\\
413 - I'll tell you what we'll do.\\
414 - What?\\
415 - Here.\\
416 - You pay me for these and you tell
Ethel\\
417 - that you bought two tickets.\\
418 - What about Lucy?\\
419 - I'll tell Lucy that you gave me your
tickets back\\
420 - and I sold them.\\
421 - That way, they'll both agree to go.\\
422 - Mm-hmm, well, what are you gonna do\\
423 - about our two mules sitting next to
each other?\\
424 - Put blinkers on them?\\
425 - You know how they are.\\
426 - By tomorrow night, they'll be the
best of friends.\\
427 - They can't stay mad at each other.\\
428 - You're right.\\
429 - Sure.\\
430 - I'll go and tell, uh, Francis I
bought the tickets.\\
431 - (guffawing)\\
432 - Okay, Fred.\\
433 - See you later.\\
434 - I guess it's right here.\\
435 - Loge seats!\\
436 - Yeah. Second and third in.\\
437 - Pardon me.\\
438 - Sorry.\\
439 - Thanks.\\
440 - Say, these seats aren't bad,\\
441 - considering how tough they were to
get.\\
442 - Wasn't that a break they had a
cancellation\\
443 - just as you got to the box office?\\
444 - Yep, yep. You didn't see Lucy at all
today, huh?\\
445 - I saw her; I didn't speak to her.\\
446 - Uh-huh. I thought probably you'd made
up.\\
447 - You two are pretty good friends, you
know?\\
448 - Eh.\\
449 - Let me look around, huh?\\
450 - Oh, isn't this thrilling?\\
451 - People who come to the theater\\
452 - always look so intellectual and
well-groomed.\\
453 - Present company excepted.\\
454 - I wonder who those two people are.\\
455 - Oh, I hope they don't come in late\\
456 - and crawl all over us.\\
457 - If there's anything I can't stand,\\
458 - it's people who come in late\\
459 - and crawl all over you.\\
460 - Quiet. Curtain's going up.\\
461 - (doorbell ringing onstage)\\
462 - Pardon, please.\\
463 - ACTOR: Good afternoon, Cynthia.
Lucy!\\
464 - ACTRESS: Good afternoon, sir.\\
465 - What are you doing here?\\
466 - What are you doing here?\\
467 - Shh!
Go in, go in, honey.\\
468 - I thought you said you took those two
tickets back.\\
469 - I thought you got our tickets at the
box office.\\
470 - Shh!\\
471 - I thought you'd be friends by now.\\
472 - Well, we're not.\\
473 - Go in, honey.
No, I'm not going in.\\
474 - MAN: Go on, lady. I can't hold this
all night.\\
475 - Shut up.\\
476 - Shh!\\
477 - Well, I'm going in.
I don't care.\\
478 - MAN: Just sit down. Sit down.\\
479 - ACTRESS: Well, John, to what do I owe
this visit?\\
480 - ACTOR: Oh, nothing.\\
481 - ACTRESS: An important man like you...\\
482 - (whispering): Let me see, Fred.\\
483 - ACTRESS: One lump or two?\\
484 - ACTOR: Three.\\
485 - WOMAN (chcukling): You're not
fighting weight\\
486 - like most of us, I fear.\\
487 - The cookies are delicious.\\
488 - Ricky?\\
489 - Would you like...\\
490 - I would.\\
491 - (grumbling)\\
492 - Fred, can I look through your
binoculars?\\
493 - (shouting): I don't care!\\
494 - (audience shushing)\\
495 - Why do you have to be so selfish?\\
496 - Just let me...\\
497 - (binoculars breaking)\\
498 - ACTRESS: I never see you anymore.\\
499 - ACTOR: I've been awfully busy.\\
500 - ACTRESS: Nonsense.\\
501 - Your problem is that you have too
many friends.\\
502 - ACTOR: Nobody ever has too many
friends.\\
503 - Friendship is a terribly important
thing, Cynthia.\\
504 - As a matter of fact,\\
505 - friends are about the most important
thing\\
506 - in the world.\\
507 - Ha!\\
508 - ACTOR: ...friendship, Cynthia.\\
509 - Don't let a friend get away.\\
510 - You'll be sorry.\\
511 - That's a hot one.\\
512 - I'd like to hear this play if you
don't mind.\\
513 - ACTOR: I'll tell you, Cynthia...\\
514 - Who's stopping you?\\
515 - You are, by talking so much.\\
516 - Shh!			    Shh!\\
517 - I've got just as much right to...\\
518 - Oh, no, you haven't got just as much
right...\\
519 - Yes, I have...\\
520 - Ouch!\\
521 - Would you please sit down\\
522 - and stop making so much noise?\\
523 - I told you you were talking too much.\\
524 - I wasn't talking any more than you
do.\\
525 - (audience shushing)\\
526 - At least when I talk, I say
something.\\
527 - We're switching.
We're switching.\\
528 - Oh, we are?
Well, I'm glad.\\
529 - Sit over here while I...\\
530 - sit over here.\\
531 - Sit there.\\
532 - I lost my shoe.
What?\\
533 - My shoe.
Your shoe?\\
534 - There's your shoe.\\
535 - I got it.
I got it.\\
536 - (audience shushing)\\
537 - ACTRESS: That's right, I'll see you
Monday.\\
538 - Now, John, what were you saying?\\
539 - ACTOR: Well, it's about your friend,
Marie Van Schlieg.\\
540 - ACTRESS: She is no friend of mine.\\
541 - What about her?\\
542 - What about her, John?\\
543 - ACTOR: We just got a cable from the
Riviera\\
544 - where she's been vacationing.\\
545 - ACTRESS: Yes, this country isn't good
enough for her.\\
546 - Well, what about her?\\
547 - ACTOR: She's dead.\\
548 - ACTRESS: Dead?\\
549 - I... I don't believe it.\\
550 - (sobbing): Marie gone!\\
551 - ACTOR: Cynthia, Cynthia,\\
552 - you've got to get hold of yourself.\\
553 - You don't understand.\\
554 - Marie and I are friends.\\
555 - Only now she'll never know it.\\
556 - Oh, John, we had a little quarrel.\\
557 - I said some terrible things,\\
558 - unforgivable things.\\
559 - Oh, I'll never forgive myself.\\
560 - We quarreled over some silly little
thing.\\
561 - I don't even remember what it was.\\
562 - ACTOR: Don't blame yourself too much,
Cynthia.\\
563 - ACTRESS: I should have been bigger.\\
564 - We were both too proud to say "I'm
sorry."\\
565 - Oh, what wouldn't I give to see her
one more time.\\
566 - Just once more to tell her I'm sorry.\\
567 - Oh, what a lesson I've learned, John.\\
568 - If only the whole world could learn\\
569 - never to quarrel with a dear friend.\\
570 - And if you do, don't let foolish
pride keep you apart.\\
571 - Hold her in your arms\\
572 - and tell her you're sorry.\\
573 - Lucy!			Ethel!\\
574 - I'm sorry.\\
575 - I'm sorry.\\
576 - Oh, it was all my fault.\\
577 - No, it was my fault.\\
578 - Will you two please sit down.\\
579 - We're, we're very sorry.\\
580 - Well, that's all right.\\
581 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
582 - ANNOUNCER: I Love Lucy is a Desilu
Production.\\
583 - Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz\\
584 - will be back next week at this same
time.
\subsection {Episode 10: Ricky's Contract}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Good morning, Lucy.\\
3 - Hi.
Hi.\\
4 - I'll get the rent money.\\
5 - How did you know what we wanted?\\
6 - Listen, there's just one thing\\
7 - that'll put a smile like that\\
8 - on Fred's face.\\
9 - Now, Fred, this is my big day.\\
10 - I get to hold some money for a few
minutes.\\
11 - Oh.
That's long enough.\\
12 - Any word?\\
13 - Not yet.\\
14 - I wonder why.\\
15 - Who knows.\\
16 - How's he?\\
17 - Just awful.\\
18 - No kidding.\\
19 - Getting worse.\\
20 - What are you talking, shorthand?\\
21 - Pay attention.\\
22 - I was asking her if Ricky had heard\\
23 - from Hollywood about his screen test.\\
24 - Oh, that's right.
Any word?\\
25 - Not yet.
Wonder why.\\
26 - Don't know.\\
27 - Too bad.\\
28 - Aah, you got me doing it now!\\
29 - You know, that talent scout made a
big, fat mistake.\\
30 - Mr. Benjamin?
What did he do?\\
31 - Oh, he told Ricky that he'd hear from
Hollywood\\
32 - in a couple of weeks.\\
33 - It's been more than two weeks now\\
34 - and Ricky's absolutely frantic.\\
35 - Yeah, that wasn't so smart.\\
36 - Ricky's got nothing to worry about.\\
37 - He's a cinch to get that contract.\\
38 - I wish he was as sure of that as you
are.\\
39 - You'll see.\\
40 - Oh, I got to go and put this away.\\
41 - See you later, honey.
Okay, dear.\\
42 - What was that all about?\\
43 - Oh, he's gone to put the money\\
44 - in his secret hiding place.\\
45 - Do you mean to tell me\\
46 - he hides that money someplace and
doesn't tell you\\
47 - where it is?
That's right.\\
48 - Why, I should think that would drive
you crazy.\\
49 - It used to.\\
50 - But confidentially\\
51 - one day I took the whole house apart\\
52 - and finally found the secret hiding
place.\\
53 - Good girl.\\
54 - How long have you known?\\
55 - 24 years.\\
56 - Ha, ha!\\
57 - (chuckling)\\
58 - Gee, I'm sorry Ricky's so upset\\
59 - about not hearing from Hollywood.\\
60 - Yeah, we were talking about it last
night.\\
61 - He says this whole thin' has him on
pins and niddles.\\
62 - Aw...\\
63 - And you should see the way he is
about that telephone.\\
64 - He even takes it to bed with him.\\
65 - No kidding.\\
66 - Yeah.\\
67 - Breakfast is ready, dear!\\
68 - Lucy!\\
69 - Yeah?\\
70 - Oh.\\
71 - I'm sorry, dear.\\
72 - Hi, Ricky.\\
73 - Good morning, dear.\\
74 - (grunts)\\
75 - Well, here's the morning paper.\\
76 - (grunts)\\
77 - (sighs)\\
78 - (glass tinkling)\\
79 - Hello? Hello?
Hello?\\
80 - Honey...\\
81 - (tinkling)\\
82 - The rest you'll have to do yourself.\\
83 - I'm not hungry.\\
84 - Aw, come on now, you have to eat
something.\\
85 - You didn't eat any dinner last night.\\
86 - I can't help... but I can't eat\\
87 - until I find out about this thin'.\\
88 - (phone rings)\\
89 - Hello?\\
90 - No, she's not here.\\
91 - Who's not here?\\
92 - You.\\
93 - Who was that?!\\
94 - Caroline Appleby.\\
95 - No wonder I haven't been getting any
calls\\
96 - for a couple of days.\\
97 - Have you been telling everybody I
wasn't here?\\
98 - I got to keep this line open.\\
99 - How about that? I've been cut off
from the world.\\
100 - Oh, hi, Ethel.\\
101 - Ah, Rick, here's your mail.\\
102 - Oh!\\
103 - Nothing from Hollywood.\\
104 - What's the matter?\\
105 - Don't you trust me?\\
106 - I trust you.\\
107 - You'd think they'd let me know.\\
108 - I've been waiting over two weeks now.\\
109 - What are you kicking about?\\
110 - I've been waiting to hear from
Hollywood for 30 years!\\
111 - Here's your mail, Lucy.\\
112 - Oh, is there anything for...\\
113 - No. He's in bad shape.\\
114 - And getting worse all the time.\\
115 - The poor thing's about to explode.\\
116 - (sighing)\\
117 - Well, he just can't go on like this.\\
118 - We're gonna have to do something to
get his mind off it.\\
119 - What?\\
120 - Well, why don't we go in there\\
121 - and just sort of be gay, you know?\\
122 - Tell him funny stories, make him
laugh.\\
123 - It won't work.\\
124 - It might.
It's worth a try.\\
125 - Come on.\\
126 - All right.\\
127 - Hi, Ricky.\\
128 - Hi, Rick, ol' pal, what's new?\\
129 - Hi, Ricky!\\
130 - Uh, did I tell you the funny thing\\
131 - I heard on television the other
night?\\
132 - No. What was it?\\
133 - Well, this fellow was big game
hunting in Africa,\\
134 - and he shot an elephant in his
pajamas\\
135 - and this dumb girl said, "Well, how
in the world\\
136 - did an elephant ever get into your
pajamas?"\\
137 - (guffawing)\\
138 - (laughing out loud)\\
139 - That's kind of funny, Rick.\\
140 - Please, not on an empty stomach.\\
141 - Well, uh, I heard a funny one last
night, Rick.\\
142 - Uh, uh... uh, comic on television,\\
143 - he was giving the weather report\\
144 - and he said, uh, "Tomorrow, muggy,\\
145 - "followed by 'tueggy,' 'weggy'\\
146 - 'thurggy,' 'friggy' and 'saggy.'"\\
147 - (laughing): "Saggy"!\\
148 - Why, that's (guffawing)   funny,
Ricky.\\
149 - (laughter subsides)\\
150 - You think it's out of order?\\
151 - He didn't even hear you.\\
152 - I heard him. "Muggy, tueggy,
saggy..."\\
153 - (muttering): Very funny.\\
154 - Well, uh, how about this one?\\
155 - Uh.... there was a fella, see, a...\\
156 - a traveling salesman,\\
157 - and, he, uh, he comes up to this
farmhouse...\\
158 - Fred!\\
159 - Well, it's the only one I can think
of.\\
160 - Um... did you ever see\\
161 - my imitation of a Pekinese?\\
162 - A Pekinese?!\\
163 - Yeah.			Oh!\\
164 - Want to see it? 	Yeah.\\
165 - Oh, okay.\\
166 - Isn't that funny, Rick?\\
167 - You know what always makes me feel
good\\
168 - when I'm down in the dumps?\\
169 - What?		    No.\\
170 - A community sing.\\

193 - Now, why don't you go down to
rehearsal?\\
194 - Oh, I don't know.	Yeah.\\
195 - I don't want to...\\
196 - Oh, look, I promise,\\

anything, huh?\\

199 - Word of honor.\\
200 - Now, go on, go on, scat, scat.\\
201 - Go on, Rick.\\
202 - Now, be sure you call me.\\
203 - (Ricky screams, phone dropping)\\
204 - Now, how can you call me\\
205 - when you don't even have the phone
here?!\\
206 - Are you going to skip your number?\\
207 - No, no, we'll do my number.\\
208 - But it's such a bright number and you
feel so lousy.\\
209 - Never mind the way I feel.\\
210 - Just play the music, I'll sing the
song.\\
211 - (lilting intro playing)\\
212 - Not so far from here, there's a very
lively atmosphere\\
213 - Everybody's going there this year\\
214 - And there's a reason\\
215 - The season never closes there\\
216 - Love and music you'll find everywhere\\
217 - People always having fun down there,
so come along.\\
218 - (music)\\
219 - I'm on my way to Cuba\\
220 - That's where I'm going\\
221 - (music)\\
222 - Cuba, that's where I'll stay\\
223 - Cuba, where wine is flowing\\
224 - And where dark-eyed Stellas light the
fellow's panatelas\\
225 - Cuba, where is all happy\\
226 - (music)\\
227 - Cuba, where all is gay\\
228 - Why don't you plan a wonderful trip\\
229 - To Havana, hop on a ship\\
230 - And I'll see you in C-u-b-a!\\
231 - Why don't you plan a wonderful trip\\
232 - To Havana, hop on a ship\\
233 - And I'll see you in C-u-b-a!\\
234 - Yeah.\\
235 - Yeah.\\
236 - No, I'm just baby-sitting\\
237 - until she gets back from the beauty
parlor.\\
238 - Okay, I'll leave a message that you
called.\\
239 - Good-bye.\\
240 - (phone rings)\\
241 - Hello.\\
242 - No, she's not home.\\
243 - No, nothing's wrong, dear.\\
244 - It's just that Ricky hasn't let her
use the phone\\
245 - for a few days; he's expecting an
important call.\\
246 - Lucy's quite a talker, you know,\\
247 - especially when she gets wound up\\
248 - with one of her gabby friends, like
Caroline.\\
249 - I'll leave a message you called,
Marge.\\
250 - Oh, Caroline!\\
251 - Oh, uh...\\
252 - Well, I'll leave a message that you
called, Caroline, dear.\\
253 - Ethel, aren't we ever gonna have
lunch?\\
254 - It's just a little after 12:00.\\
255 - But we always eat at 12:00,\\
256 - and my stomach's growling.\\
257 - Well, tell your stomach, lunch is
gonna be a little late today.\\
258 - Did you hear that, Charlie?\\
259 - Oh, now, Fred, I'm baby-sitting.\\
260 - I can't leave till Lucy gets back.\\
261 - And brother, I hope it's soon.\\
262 - I'm getting writer's cramp.\\
263 - All those people that Ricky hung up
on\\
264 - finally got through.\\
265 - Look at the messages.\\
266 - Isn't it a shame one of these isn't
from Hollywood?\\
267 - Yeah...\\
268 - Wait a minute.\\
269 - Wait a ding-dong minute.\\
270 - Give me that pad.\\
271 - What are you gonna do?\\
272 - Just watch the old mastermind.\\
273 - What are you doing?\\
274 - There.\\
275 - "Hollywood called-- you got the job."\\
276 - What do you think?\\
277 - I think the old master\\
278 - has lost his mind.\\
279 - Don't you get it?\\
280 - We'll leave it for Lucy, she'll call
Ricky,\\
281 - tells him the good news,\\
282 - he stops worrying, and everything is
rosy.\\
283 - Especially your nose after he hits
you.\\
284 - Oh...\\
285 - He's gonna get the job-- he's a
cinch--\\
286 - and when the real news comes,\\
287 - he'll thank us for saving him all
these hours of worry.\\
288 - Well, supposing he doesn't get the
job?\\
289 - But he will.\\
290 - Well, supposing he doesn't?\\
291 - Oh, well, anyway, he's been a moving
picture star\\
292 - for two or three days and that's
something.\\
293 - No, Fred.\\
294 - Oh, Ethel...\\
295 - Give me one good reason.\\
296 - Well, first of all, it sounds like
one of Lucy's ideas,\\
297 - and second...\\
298 - Hold it. That's enough for me.\\
299 - Look, why don't you go on over\\
300 - and fix yourself a couple of
sandwiches.\\
301 - That'll tide you over till lunch.\\
302 - You're the cook in our family.\\
303 - I'm gonna wait for you.\\
304 - Okay.\\
305 - (phone rings)\\
306 - Hello.\\
307 - Hi, Sue.\\
308 - No, she isn't here.\\
309 - Okay. What's your number?\\
310 - Oh, just a minute.\\
311 - Hi. What's that number?\\
312 - Circle-seven-2099.\\
313 - Wait a minute, here she is.\\
314 - Oh, boy, am I glad you're back.\\
315 - This phone's been ringing off the
hook.\\
316 - You've got a thousand messages.\\
317 - Who's this?		Sue.\\
318 - Oh, thanks.\\
319 - I'll see you later.\\
320 - I gotta go fix fatso some lunch.\\
321 - Okay. Thanks, Ethel.\\
322 - Hi, Sue.\\
323 - Oh, yeah, I know.
Isn't it awful?\\
324 - Ricky wouldn't let me talk on the
phone.\\
325 - Well, he's at rehearsal now.\\
326 - We got time for a nice, long chat.\\
327 - Oh, really?
Tell me all about it.\\
328 - Uh-huh.\\
329 - No kidding.\\
330 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
331 - Really?\\
332 - Oh.\\
333 - Uh-huh.\\
334 - I don't believe it.\\
335 - Yeah. Oh...\\
336 - Oh, Sue!\\
337 - Sue, you'll have to call me back!\\
338 - Ethel! Fred!\\
339 - Oh, Ricky.\\
340 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
341 - Oh, how wonderful.\\
342 - Oh... oh, this is wonderful.\\
343 - Ricky, Hollywood called and you got
the job!\\
344 - Oh, isn't it wonderful, honey?\\
345 - I love you.\\
346 - (smooches)\\
347 - What, dear?\\
348 - Well, who is this?\\
349 - Oh. Well, well, Marco, Marco,\\
350 - be sure and give him the message as
soon as he comes in.\\
351 - It's very important.
Have him call me, huh?\\
352 - Well, you remember Mr. Benjamin, the
talent scout?\\
353 - Yeah, well, the whole thing happened\\
354 - when Mr. Benjamin arrived here...\\
355 - Honestly, of all the dumb ideas,\\
356 - wanting to leave a phony message.\\
357 - All right, all right.\\
358 - How about a little less gab and a
little more grub?\\
359 - In the first place, it's terribly
cruel\\
360 - and in the second place...\\
361 - In the second place,\\
362 - why don't you keep quiet in the first
place?\\
363 - Okay.\\
364 - Here you are.\\
365 - Now, I don't trust you.\\
366 - Give me that message.\\
367 - I haven't got it.\\
368 - Give me that message!\\
369 - I want to tear it up before someone
sees it by mistake.\\
370 - But I don't have it; I gave it to
you.\\
371 - You didn't...\\
372 - Oh, that's right...
and then I...\\
373 - Oh, no!\\
374 - Now, what, dear?\\
375 - Oh, I must have left it by the
telephone!\\
376 - Come on!\\
377 - No, you go ahead.\\
378 - I want to eat my lunch.\\
379 - I want you to be with me.\\
380 - In case she's already seen it,\\
381 - then you can help me explain.\\
382 - Come on.\\
383 - Patience, Charlie, patience.\\
384 - Yeah. Well, you be sure and have him
call me, huh, Marco?\\
385 - It's very important. Bye.\\
386 - Oh, boy, isn't that wonderful!\\
387 - Oh!		    Lucy...\\
388 - Oh, are you the sly one, Ethel Mertz!\\
389 - Uh....\\
390 - Oh, what a sense of humor,\\
391 - letting me find this message all by
myself!\\
392 - Oh, honey, isn't that wonderful?\\
393 - Uh...
Hollywood! Hollywood!\\
394 - Oh, we're gonna have a great big
house\\
395 - and we're gonna give great big
parties\\
396 - and we're gonna invite lots of movie
stars\\
397 - and we're gonna have a big, splashy
swimming pool\\
398 - and there I am, in my mink bathing
suit\\
399 - up on top of the high diving board...\\
400 - Lucy, don't dive in!\\
401 - Huh?\\
402 - There's no water in the pool.\\
403 - In fact, there's no pool.\\
404 - What are you talking about?\\
405 - Well... uh...\\
406 - You tell her, Fred.\\
407 - Ethel, what's the matter?\\
408 - Uh... Fred wrote that note.\\
409 - Oh, did Fred answer the phone?\\
410 - No. Uh...\\
411 - Lucy, there was no call from
Hollywood.\\
412 - What?!\\
413 - It was just an idea I had.\\
414 - I thought if we gave, uh, uh, Ricky\\
415 - some kind of a phony message\\
416 - that, uh, he'd stop worrying\\
417 - and then when the real message
came...\\
418 - Oh, no!\\
419 - I told him it was a lousy idea.\\
420 - I took the note and I was gonna tear
it up,\\
421 - and by mistake, I left it by the
telephone.\\
422 - Can you ever forgive us?\\
423 - No!\\
424 - Now, listen, it could've been worse.\\
425 - You might've called Ricky.\\
426 - Yeah...
Ricky!\\
427 - Ricky!\\
428 - No, you didn't!\\
429 - Oh, I did.
He wasn't in,\\
430 - but I told Marco to give him the
message.\\
431 - Oh, no.\\
432 - Marco, remember what I told you\\
433 - about Hollywood a few minutes ago?\\
434 - Well, listen. What?\\
435 - Oh. Well, Mr. Green, wh-where is
everybody?\\
436 - He did?\\
437 - Oh.\\
438 - Oh, no. Thanks. Thanks.\\
439 - Yeah, yeah, we're very happy about
it.\\
440 - Yeah, good-bye.\\
441 - What happened?\\
442 - Ricky's taken the whole band over to
Lindy's to celebrate.\\
443 - Oh...		    Oh...\\
444 - This is awful.\\
445 - You bet it's awful!\\
446 - And it's all your fault.\\
447 - How could you do such a stupid thing
as write that?!\\
448 - Now, don't try to pin it onto me.\\
449 - It was Ethel's fault.
She left it here.\\
450 - It is not my fault.\\
451 - No, Fred, it's your fault.\\
452 - How could you do that?!\\
453 - I didn't know what I was doing.\\
454 - I was half-crazed with hunger.\\
455 - Oh, Fred...\\
456 - I told you it was your fault.\\
457 - Oh, never mind, Ethel.\\
458 - Doesn't matter whose fault it is.\\
459 - It's done.\\
460 - Now, the important thing is, which
one of you\\
461 - is gonna tell Ricky?\\
462 - Come on, Fred, I'll fix you some more
lunch.\\
463 - All right.    Oh, no, you don't!\\
464 - You're gonna stay right here and face
the music.\\
465 - Not me.\\
466 - Why not? You did it.\\
467 - Okay. Tell him I did it.\\
468 - First he'll have to find me.\\
469 - Me, too.\\
470 - Wait a minute.\\
471 - How come I get left holding the bag?\\
472 - I didn't do anything.\\
473 - Well, that's life.\\
474 - Come on, Ethel.\\
475 - All right, all right.\\
476 - I'll tell him.\\
477 - Really?\\
478 - If you stay here and give me moral
support.\\
479 - Okay.\\
480 - Of course, when I tell him,\\
481 - I'll be holding little Ricky.\\
482 - He wouldn't hit a woman with a baby
in her arms.\\
483 - Oh, that's a great idea.\\
484 - I'll just say, "Ricky, it's all a
mistake, dear.\\
485 - "You didn't really get any call from
Hollywood.\\
486 - "Fred wrote the note and Ethel
accidentally left it here\\
487 - and I innocently called you..."\\
488 - FRED: Now, wait a minute.
I'll stay on one condition.\\
489 - What's that?\\
490 - When you come to "Fred wrote the
note",\\
491 - you hand me the baby.\\
492 - And then when you get to the part,\\
493 - "Ethel accidentally left it by the
phone" and you hand...\\
494 - Never mind, never mind.\\
495 - Just forget all about the baby.\\
496 - Now, look, crazy things like this
happen.\\
497 - Ricky's just gonna have to accept it.\\
498 - Now, the three of us are gonna stay
right here\\
499 - and tell him exactly what happened,
okay?\\
500 - All right, sit down.		 All
right.\\
501 - (sighs)\\
502 - (sighs)\\
503 - Now, look, there's nothing to worry
about.\\
504 - We're just gonna tell him the truth.\\
505 - Just sit back and relax.\\
506 - Sit back and relax!\\
507 - Oh, I wonder what's keeping him.\\
508 - Maybe he hopped a plane to Hollywood?\\
509 - No. Now, listen, when he does come
in,\\
510 - try to act natural.\\
511 - Don't, don't act as though something
terrible has happened.\\
512 - (doorbell buzzing)
Oh, no, we won't. We'll be...\\
513 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
514 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
515 - Why is he ringing the bell?\\
516 - Maybe it isn't Ricky.\\
517 - Oh, you're right, you're right.\\
518 - Hello, baby!\\
519 - Well, we finally made it.\\
520 - We're gonna take Hollywood by storm.\\
521 - Ha, ha, California, here I come!\\
522 - How do you like it, huh?\\
523 - Uh...\\
524 - Isn't this the most, huh?\\
525 - Yeah.\\
526 - Um... Ricky?\\
527 - Yes?\\
528 - Uh, w-w-we three have something to
say to you.\\
529 - Yes?\\
530 - I, uh...\\
531 - I really don't know how to say it.\\
532 - Well... I'll say it for you.\\
533 - I know what you want and the answer
is yes.\\
534 - You three want to organize my first
fan club.\\
535 - The Ricky Ricardo Fan Club Number
One.\\
536 - Yes, you may have the sharter.\\
537 - How-how about that?\\
538 - We got the sharter.\\
539 - Well, I guess there's only one thing
to do.\\
540 - What's that?\\
541 - I'm gonna get my autograph book.\\
542 - Oh, me, too!\\
543 - (chuckling)\\
544 - Uh... uh, excuse me, star.\\
545 - Where are you going?\\
546 - To get my autograph book.\\
547 - I left it in Indiana.\\
548 - You can't leave now.\\
549 - We have to tell him.\\
550 - I can't tell him.\\
551 - He looks just like Buddy Rogers.\\
552 - Oh...\\
553 - Now, listen, either we all march in
there together\\
554 - and tell him the truth\\
555 - or I'm gonna tell him that you wrote
the note\\
556 - and that you left it there purposely!\\
557 - (gasps)\\
558 - Now, do we march?\\
559 - Forward, march!\\
560 - Ricky...\\
561 - Yes?\\
562 - We three have some...\\
563 - Excuse me.\\
564 - Get back here.\\
565 - Now we're going in there again\\
566 - and this time you're gonna march in
front.\\
567 - Now march!\\
568 - Forward, march!\\
569 - Pretty, eh?\\
570 - Ah, this is just the beginning.\\
571 - Wait till I get to Hollywood.\\
572 - I'm gonna make that Crosby look like
a bum.\\
573 - Ricky, I-I-I can't stand anymore.\\
574 - What-what's the matter, honey?\\
575 - What can't you stand?\\
576 - Uh, about that message I left for you
at the club...\\
577 - Oh... yes, darling.\\
578 - I-I should apologize for that.\\
579 - I-I meant to call you, but...
well, I got carried away.\\
580 - After I talked to Mr. Benjamin,\\
581 - I took all the boys down to Lindy's
to celebrate.\\
582 - Yeah, well, that's just it.\\
583 - Mr. Benjamin?\\
584 - You talked to Mr. Benjamin?!\\
585 - Yeah. He wanted me to ask you
something.\\
586 - He had only gotten the wire 20
minutes before.\\
587 - How did you know?\\
588 - Well, uh...\\
589 - Have you got a friend at the
telegraph office?\\
590 - Good!\\
591 - Yeah. Yeah!\\
592 - Yeah, that's it.\\
593 - I-I got a friend at the telegraph
office.\\
594 - Yeah, yeah.\\
595 - Well, we really did hear from
Hollywood today.\\
596 - We heard from Hollywood!\\
597 - We heard... Get up!\\

5 - He's fine. We played for a couple of
hours\\
6 - and then he went to sleep.\\
7 - Oh, good. Wait till you see what I
got.\\
8 - Lucy...
What?\\
9 - You didn't buy more clothes?\\
10 - Didn't I?\\
11 - Now, look, honey, I'm only going to
do one part in one picture,\\
12 - and we're only going to be in
Hollywood one month.\\
13 - Exactly. We're going to be there a
whole month.\\
14 - It sounds different when you say it.\\
15 - Wait till you see the wonderful
bathing suit I got.\\
16 - Look.\\
17 - That's real cute.\\
18 - You like it?
Yeah.\\
19 - You want to see how it looks?\\
20 - Now wait just a minute, honey.\\
21 - Don't wake up little Ricky\\
22 - just to try a bathing suit on him.\\
23 - Little Ricky?
This is for me.\\
24 - What?!\\
25 - Usted no se puede poner ese traje de
bano\\
26 - en ningun lugar del mundo!\\
27 - How dare you say whatever you said!\\
28 - Look, no wife of mine is gonna be
seen wearing that thing.\\
29 - All right, I'll take it back.\\
30 - Okay.\\
31 - I can't afford to argue with you...\\
32 - till we get out there.\\
33 - What's all that?\\
34 - Travel folders.\\
35 - Trying to figure out which is the
best way to go.\\
36 - You know, we've got to save as much
money\\
37 - as we can on this trip.\\
38 - Well, movie stars always fly.\\
39 - I'm not a movie star yet.\\
40 - Let's not spend the money before we
make it.\\
41 - I was undecided between the bus and
the train.\\
42 - Well, I don't know...\\
43 - It's better for the baby.\\
44 - It's the quickest.
He'll sleep the whole way.\\
45 - Well, that's true.	  Look here.\\
46 - "Special facilities for the baby.
Family plan.\\
47 - Your wife and children can fly for
half fare."\\
48 - Well, I... I guess it'll be better
for the baby.\\
49 - Why, sure. Well, you'd better make
reservations, too.\\
50 - Good flights are hard to get on.\\
51 - Okay, I'll call them.\\
52 - The bus or the train.\\
53 - Really, Ricky.\\
54 - All right, all right!
I was just thinking.\\
55 - Reservations, please.\\
56 - I'd like to make reservation\\
57 - for Los Angeles next Monday.\\
58 - That's two adults and a child.\\
59 - Family plan.\\
60 - Uh, Ricky, you've never been across
the country, have you?\\
61 - No.\\
62 - What?\\
63 - Leaves in the evening, gets there the
next morning?\\
64 - Well, that will be fine.\\
65 - Yes, the name is Ricardo.\\
66 - Just a minute, Ricky.\\
67 - Listen...\\
68 - Ricardo. R-i-c...\\
69 - You know, it'd be a shame to cross
the country\\
70 - and not really get a chance to see
it, don't you think?\\
71 - No, no, no.
"C." "C."\\
72 - "R-I..." You know, on the train,\\
73 - you can see the country you're
passing through.\\
74 - This is little Ricky's first chance
to go across\\
75 - the United States, so don't you think\\
76 - you ought to get a chance to really
see it?\\
77 - Don't you think so?
Would you please keep quiet?\\
78 - No, not you, sir. No.\\
79 - Would you please hang on a minute?\\
80 - Now, look, honey, will you keep quiet
so I can talk to the man?\\
81 - Yeah, well, talk all you want to, but
we're taking the train.\\
82 - All right.\\
83 - Well...\\
84 - What?!\\
85 - I said we're taking the train.\\
86 - Would you please hang on a minute?\\
87 - Look, this may be the baby's only
chance\\
88 - to cross the United States, and I
think he should see it.\\
89 - Now, we are taking the train.\\
90 - Look, mister, I'm afraid that I'm
gonna have...\\
91 - Oh, you're married, too.\\
92 - Thanks anyway.\\
93 - Now, look, Lucy, why don't you make
up your mind\\
94 - which way you want to go\\
95 - before you get me involved with all
these people?\\
96 - First, it's got to be the plane.\\
97 - Now, it's got to be the train.\\
98 - Yeah, well, you got to admit it makes
sense.\\
99 - Now, now, here's the number.
You call them.\\
100 - You'd better read the bus folder
before I call them.\\
101 - Oh, don't be silly, the bus.\\
102 - You sure you want the train?\\
103 - I'm positive.\\
104 - All right, the train.\\
105 - It's a wonderful chance for the baby\\
106 - to see all of the United States.\\
107 - I just didn't think of it.
Okay.\\
108 - That's all.		Okay.\\
109 - Reservations, please.\\
110 - Look, I'd like to make a reservation\\
111 - for Los Angeles next Monday\\
112 - for two adults and a child.\\
113 - Yes, I'll hang on.\\
114 - Uh, Ricky?\\
115 - What?\\
116 - Oh, that's good.\\
117 - Yeah, I'll pick them up tomorrow.\\
118 - How much would they be?\\
119 - Uh, could I speak to you, dear?\\
120 - In a minute.\\
121 - No, now, dear.\\
122 - Will you please hang on a minute?\\
123 - Well, listen.\\
124 - "Get the most out of your
cross-country trip.\\
125 - "Don't fly over it\\
126 - "or whoosh through it at 80 or 90
miles an hour\\
127 - "without stopping.\\
128 - "On the bus, you make frequent stops.\\
129 - "You can get out, see the scenery,\\
130 - "meet the people in various parts of
the country.\\
131 - You and your fellow passengers are
one big happy family."\\
132 - One big happy family.\\
133 - Isn't that nice?\\
134 - Look, mister, I'll have to call you
back on this.\\
135 - Yes, thank you very much.\\
136 - I was only thinking of the baby.\\
137 - Look, Lucy, this whole thing was my
fault.\\
138 - I...\\
139 - Your fault?\\
140 - Yeah.\\
141 - It was something that I said that
started this whole thing.\\
142 - What'd you say?\\
143 - I do.\\
144 - Now, look, I'll carry you and little
Ricky\\
145 - across country piggyback\\
146 - if you'll just make up your mind
which way you want to go.\\
147 - Now, once and for all, what is it
gonna be?\\
148 - Plane, train or bus?\\
149 - Have you decided?\\
150 - Yes.\\
151 - Well?
We'll go by car.\\
152 - Good. I'll call...\\
153 - By car?\\
154 - Yeah.\\
155 - We don't even own a car.\\
156 - Well, we'll get one.\\
157 - I don't know why didn't think of this
before.\\
158 - That way, we can really see the
country.\\
159 - Stop where we want to as long as we
want to.\\
160 - We can see the Grand Canyon, Pike's
Peak, Yosemite. Huh?\\
161 - You know, you'll have to get a car\\
162 - when you get out there anyway.\\
163 - You absolutely need a car in Southern
California.\\
164 - You do, huh?
Yeah.\\
165 - I've been reading up on it.\\
166 - There's a car for every 2?
people in California.\\
167 - Now, you and I and little Ricky,
that's 2? people.\\
168 - When we get to the border, without a
car,\\
169 - they won't let us in.\\
170 - Well, you know something?\\
171 - I think you've got something there
someplace.\\
172 - We probably can get a convertible
here\\
173 - a lot cheaper than out there.\\
174 - A Cadillac convertible!\\
175 - Who said nothing about a Cadillac
convertible!\\
176 - I mean, maybe if we can get a used
car,\\
177 - we maybe can afford it,\\
178 - but don't get your heart set\\
179 - on a Cadillac convertible kind of a
deal.\\
180 - No. No, I won't give it another
thought.\\
181 - Good.\\
182 - Cadillac convertible!\\
183 - Oh, hi. Come on in.\\
184 - Hi.
Hi.\\
185 - Hi, Fred.
Hi, Ethel.\\
186 - Oh, Ethel, wait till you see\\
187 - the wonderful bathing suit I got.\\
188 - ok, honey, isn't this just absolutely
dreamy?\\
189 - Very nice.\\
190 - What's eating her?\\
191 - She's been moping around the house
like a sick cat\\
192 - just 'cause you two are leaving.\\
193 - Aw, honey, don't feel like that.\\
194 - We're only gonna be gone a month.\\
195 - No, you won't.\\
196 - Ricky will be a big star\\
197 - and they'll give him a long-term
contract\\
198 - and you'll get a house and stay out
there.\\
199 - We'll never see you again.\\
200 - Oh, honey, of course you will.\\
201 - Even if we do stay out there,\\
202 - you'll come visit us.\\
203 - Oh, no, we won't.\\
204 - It's too far.\\
205 - Besides, you'll make all new friends.\\
206 - They'll be rich and famous.\\
207 - You won't have any time for us.\\
208 - Yes, we will, honey.\\
209 - Now, look, Ethel, I promise you,\\
210 - no matter how big a star we become,\\
211 - and even after we win the Oscar,\\
212 - you'll still be our dearest\\
213 - and closest friends.\\
214 - We'll never forget you, honey.\\
215 - We'll never forget you either.\\
216 - Look at those two, will you?\\
217 - Two sentimental idiots.\\
218 - Well, I can't help it\\
219 - when I think I may never see my
little godson again.\\
220 - Oh, no...\\
221 - Now, cut it out.\\
222 - Yeah, cut it out, will you?\\
223 - When you see all those fancy people,\\
224 - we'll look kind of dowdy and plain to
you.\\
225 - No, honey.\\
226 - You won't want to see us anymore.\\
227 - Hey, hey!\\
228 - Why don't you come along with us?\\
229 - You mean, us?\\
230 - Go to California?\\
231 - Yeah. Why not?\\
232 - Oh, wonderful!\\
233 - Sure, that would be great.\\
234 - Hey, hey, hold it.\\
235 - We can't afford a trip like that.\\
236 - Oh, why not, Fred.\\
237 - We never go anyplace.\\
238 - I haven't been out of this town for
20 years.\\
239 - Now, just a minute.\\
240 - You forget that lovely trip you took
to Minnesota.\\
241 - Oh, that was a lot of fun.\\
242 - I went to Mayo Brothers to have my
gallstones taken out.\\
243 - You can yak all you want to.\\
244 - You know as well as I do\\
245 - that we can't afford this trip.\\
246 - Those tickets cost money.\\
247 - Oh, no, no, Fred!\\
248 - We're getting a car and driving out.\\
249 - Oh, you're buying a car, huh?
Yeah.\\
250 - And the whole back seat is empty,\\
251 - so you might as well come along.\\
252 - How about it, Fred?\\
253 - Well, it does seem like a cheap way
to go.\\
254 - California, here we come!\\
255 - Hooray!\\
256 - That's great, Fred.\\
257 - It'll practically be for nothing.\\
258 - We'll each pay for half of the gas...\\
259 - Pay for half the gas?!\\
260 - New York, here we stay.\\
261 - Well, I thought as long as you're
going,\\
262 - you'll want to pay for half of the
expenses.\\
263 - Well, I don't see why.\\
264 - You're going anyway.\\
265 - Well, when the front seat goes, the
back seat has to follow.\\
266 - Well, I just thought...\\
267 - Don't think I'm gonna pay for half
your trip.\\
268 - Well, how do you like that?\\
269 - All right now, fellas, don't lose
your tempers.\\
270 - Oh, it's no use, Lucy.\\
271 - I knew it was too good to last.\\
272 - The only way I'll get a trip\\
273 - is to stay right here in New York\\
274 - and hope for another gallstone.\\
275 - Gee, Ethel, I sure feel sorry for
you,\\
276 - being married to such a pinch penny.\\
277 - Well, you're not exactly married to
the horn of plenty.\\
278 - What do you mean by that?\\
279 - Well, for once, I think Fred is
right.\\
280 - Why should you stick us for half your
gasoline?\\
281 - Stick you? Well!\\
282 - Now I know who holds the penny\\
283 - while Fred pinches it!\\
284 - That does it.\\
285 - Yeah, we wouldn't go now if you
begged us!\\
286 - Don't worry.
Come on, Fred.\\
287 - Yeah, get out of our back seat.\\
288 - Gladly.\\
289 - How do you like that?
We got to go anyway.\\
290 - We got to buy-- pay for the gas
anyhow.\\
291 - Huh!	    Huh, huh!\\
292 - Hey, hey, wait a minute.\\
293 - Ricky?\\
294 - Ricky, we are going anyway.\\
295 - Hmm?\\
296 - We do have to pay for the gas anyhow\\
297 - and the back seat is empty.\\
298 - How do you like that?\\
299 - I think it's finally happened.\\
300 - What has?\\
301 - Well, I think that this time\\
302 - I'm a tighter skate than Fred.\\
303 - Huh?\\
304 - My flint is skinnier than his.\\
305 - Does that mean that you want them to
go?\\
306 - Sure.\\
307 - Oh!			Oh, boy!\\
308 - You'll really take us, Ricky?\\
309 - Will you pay for half of the oil?\\
310 - No, but I'll furnish all the water.\\
311 - Oh, California, here we come.\\
312 - Hi, girl.\\
313 - Hi.	    Hi.\\
314 - How's the baby?\\
315 - Mrs. Trumbull took him over to the
park for a walk.\\
316 - Did you buy a car?\\
317 - No.	No.\\
318 - We looked at a hundred of them\\
319 - and drove them all around the block.\\
320 - If we'd been driving in a straight
line,\\
321 - we'd be in California by now.\\
322 - Oh, what a shame.\\
323 - And all those ads in the paper
sounded so good, too.\\
324 - Yeah, they sounded good, but you
should've seen them.\\
325 - I slid in and out of so many car
seats, my pants are shiny.\\
326 - Aw, Ricky.\\
327 - Well, don't give up.\\
328 - Fred may be able to help you.\\
329 - Fred?
Yeah.\\
330 - He's got a friend who's in the used
car business.\\
331 - Now he tells us.\\
332 - He never thought about it until after
you left.\\
333 - RICKY: Oh, good.       I'll call him.\\
334 - Fred!\\
335 - He and this guy are real pals.\\
336 - They used to be in vaudeville
together,\\
337 - so he ought to give you a good deal.\\
338 - Fred!!\\
339 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
340 - I didn't see you come in.\\
341 - Listen, Lucy and Ricky didn't find a
car.\\
342 - I can't hear you. My head's still
ringing.\\
343 - Now what?\\
344 - Lucy and Ricky didn't find a car.\\
345 - They want to talk to your friend.\\
346 - Yeah, listen, Fred.
Who is this fellow?\\
347 - Well, it's Al Hergershimer.\\
348 - He's got a lot over in Brooklyn.\\
349 - You think he'll give us a good deal?\\
350 - Sure. He says since it's me,\\
351 - I can have any car on the lot at
wholesale price.\\
352 - Hey, that sounds wonderful.\\
353 - Yeah, we'd better go see him right
now.\\
354 - No, no, no, no, no. I'd better go
over there alone, Rick.\\
355 - Why?
Well, he probably has read\\
356 - the paper about him becoming a movie
star.\\
357 - Oh, The price will go up right away.\\
358 - Yeah.\\
359 - All right, you'd better go alone.\\
360 - Now, you sure you know what we want?\\
361 - A Cadillac convertible.\\
362 - Yeah.\\
363 - Good transportation at a reasonable
price.\\
364 - Don't worry, just leave it to me.\\
365 - Okay, now, look.
Take a good look at the tires.\\
366 - It's a long trip to California.\\
367 - Yeah, Fred, get a pretty color, will
ya?\\
368 - Yeah.\\
369 - And get a nice, big, roomy back seat.\\
370 - Okay, now, wish me luck.\\
371 - Okay.	    Okay.\\
372 - Bye. So long.\\
373 - So long.\\
374 - Good transportation at a reasonable
price.\\
375 - Yeah, well, sure.\\
376 - Sure, we're just gonna take our time
driving out\\
377 - and see the country.\\
378 - Oh, isn't it wonderful?
I can hardly believe it myself.\\
379 - Hey, would you like me to give a
message\\
380 - to any of the gang out there?\\
381 - You know, Clark or Cary or Van or
Marlon?\\
382 - Oh, all right.\\
383 - Tell Bill Holden that Marion Van
Vlack\\
384 - saw Sabrina five times!\\
385 - Well, he'll be delighted.\\
386 - Lucy, Lucy, hang up.		Yeah,
what?\\
387 - I got something to tell you.
Oh.\\
388 - I'll call you back, dear. Bye-bye.\\
389 - What?
Fred just called me.\\
390 - Yeah, what is it?\\
391 - Well, wake up Ricky.
I want him to hear this, too.\\
392 - Okay. Honey, honey, honey.\\
393 - Huh? No, no, no.\\
394 - No, Mr. Zanuck, no.\\
395 - My price is a million dollars, Mr.
Zanuck.\\
396 - Now, yes or no?
Make up your mind.\\
397 - Shake him again.\\
398 - Well, I kind of hate to wake him up
until he's made the deal.\\
399 - Oh, Ricky!
Ricky, wake up!\\
400 - What?!	     Wake up, Ricky!\\
401 - Come on, Huh?	   come on.\\
402 - What's the matter?
Yeah.\\
403 - Fred just called me.\\
404 - He's bought a car and he's on his way
home with it.\\
405 - Bought it?!
What?!\\
406 - Without showing it to us?\\
407 - Well, he couldn't get you on the
phone\\
408 - and he said there were two guys\\
409 - were waiting just to snap it up.\\
410 - What is it?
What kind is it?\\
411 - It's a Cadillac.\\
412 - A Cadillac!
What color?\\
413 - Blue.\\
414 - Oh, that'll be wonderful with my
hair!\\
415 - Is it a convertible?\\
416 - I don't know,\\
417 - but he said it was just like
brand-new,\\
418 - that paint's in good shape, the tires
are fine\\
419 - and the top works perfectly.\\
420 - The top. That means it's a
convertible.\\
421 - Oh, sure.\\
422 - A blue Cadillac convertible!\\
423 - Oh, boy!\\
424 - Eh, how-how-how much did it cost?\\
425 - $300.\\
426 - $300?\\
427 - For a Cadillac?\\
428 - Oh, no, that...\\
429 - Oh, that must be the down payment or
something.\\
430 - Oh, well, maybe so.\\
431 - I was so excited, I don't really
know.\\
432 - Well, let's go downstairs and wait
for him, huh?\\
433 - I'll get my coat Okay.	     and meet
you...\\
434 - I wonder how much he really paid for
this.\\
435 - Gee, I hope the baby gets back in
time to see it.\\
436 - Oh, boy, a blue Cadillac convertible!\\
437 - I wonder what's keeping him.\\
438 - Gee, our first car.\\
439 - I can hardly wait to see it.\\
440 - I hope he got a good car.\\
441 - It's a long trip to California.\\
442 - Oh, it will be a good one.\\
443 - I told you, this is a good friend of
Fred's.\\
444 - That's good.	Hey, here comes a
blue car.\\
445 - And it's a Cadillac.\\
446 - And isn't that Fred driving?\\
447 - I don't think so.\\
448 - Oh, it's a beauty and it's almost
brand-new.\\
449 - Sure, that's Fred.\\
450 - No.\\
451 - Of course it is.\\
452 - It's our car, and it's Fred driving.\\
453 - Then how come it turned the corner?\\
454 - Oh.\\
455 - Oh...\\
456 - Here comes a blue car!\\
457 - Yeah.\\
458 - Oh, that isn't a Cadillac, is it,
Ricky?\\
459 - I don't think so.
I hope not.\\
460 - That car must be seven or eight years
old.\\
461 - We'll never get to California.\\
462 - Well, what do you think of it?\\
463 - Fred Mertz, this better be some kind
of a joke.\\
464 - Joke?\\
465 - This is a very fine car.\\
466 - It is a Cadillac.\\
467 - It is?\\
468 - Yeah, it's a Cadillac all right.\\
469 - And it is a convertible.\\
470 - The top goes up and down.\\
471 - Well, the doors work fine.\\
472 - Fred, you really didn't pay 300 bucks\\
473 - for this hunk of junk?\\
474 - Now, just for your information,\\
475 - two other guys wanted to buy this
car.\\
476 - Where were they from?
The Smithsonian Institute?\\
477 - So, it isn't brand-new,\\
478 - but it's better than one of those
flimsy jobs\\
479 - off the assembly line.\\
480 - They don't make them like this
anymore.\\
481 - I can understand why.\\
482 - Now, put that back.\\
483 - Does this one come off, too?\\
484 - You dropped something.\\
485 - It's falling apart right in front of
our eyes.\\
486 - Well, maybe the body does need a
little tightening,\\
487 - but that engine is sound as a dollar.\\
488 - Yeah? That's about all it's worth,
too.\\
489 - I tell you, this car's in good shape,\\
490 - and it drives beautifully.\\
491 - Now jump in and I'll take you for a
spin.\\
492 - Well, what have we got to lose?\\
493 - Our lives, that's what.\\
494 - Come on, get in, get in.\\
495 - RICKY: All right, go on.\\
496 - Get in.\\
497 - Come on, let's hurry up and get out
of here\\
498 - before we have to ride the engine
bareback.\\
499 - Well... okay, here we go.\\
500 - Just needs a little tune-up, that's
all.\\
501 - Fred Mertz, you go right back to
Brooklyn\\
502 - and get the money you paid for this
time bomb.\\
503 - Well, maybe it isn't everything he
said it was.\\
504 - I'm sorry, Ricky. I hope I can get
your money back.\\
505 - My money?!\\
506 - Well, naturally, I didn't want to buy
a car.\\
507 - Well, I didn't tell you to buy this
thing.\\
508 - How about that, Ethel?\\
509 - Don't come crying to me.\\
510 - Anybody who's dumb enough to pay $300
for this thing\\
511 - deserves to lose the money.\\
512 - Now, you go back to Brooklyn, and
don't you come home\\
513 - until you've got our money in your
pocket.\\
514 - Okay.\\
515 - Have you got 15 cents for the subway?\\
516 - Gee, I felt sorry for Fred.\\
517 - He looked so disappointed.\\
518 - Yeah.\\
519 - I wish there was some way that I
could help him, Ethel.\\
520 - Oh, it serves him right.\\
521 - Maybe it'll teach him a lesson.\\
522 - You think they'll give him his money
back?\\
523 - Well, if they don't, maybe he can
sell it to somebody.\\
524 - Who?\\
525 - Where are you going to find another
Fred?\\
526 - Well, there must be somebody that
wants an old car like that.\\
527 - Maybe a museum or something.\\
528 - Well, maybe a television company or a
moving picture outfit\\
529 - or something like that might be able
to use it...\\
530 - Hey!\\
531 - Hey!\\
532 - How about calling Fred's used car pal\\
533 - and telling him that we're a
television studio\\
534 - and that we need a car like that?\\
535 - And that we'll pay maybe as much
as... $500.\\
536 - Oh, he'd buy it back from Fred in a
jiffy.\\
537 - What's that guy's name?\\
538 - Uh, Hergershimer.\\
539 - I got the number.\\
540 - Fred gave it to me in case I had to
call him.\\
541 - Uh, Nevins 8-2098.\\
542 - Lucy, I got to hand it to you.\\
543 - You got a wonderful sneaky mind.\\
544 - Well, thank you very much.\\
545 - Hey, you let me...
better let me talk to him.\\
546 - Where are you supposed to be from?\\
547 - The Cuban Television Network?\\
548 - Yeah. CBS.\\
549 - The Cuban Broadcasting System.\\
550 - (Ethel laughing)      Oh...\\
551 - Hello. Hello.\\
552 - Um... I know this is no use.\\
553 - I've made about a hundred phone
calls,\\
554 - but, uh, we need a certain type of
automobile\\
555 - for a television sketch that we're
doing.\\
556 - Uh, yes, we need a... a 1923 Cadillac
touring car.\\
557 - Uh, we don't have much money,\\
558 - but, uh, we could pay $500.\\
559 - Oh. Oh, you don't have one right
there,\\
560 - but you know where you could get one?\\
561 - Oh, that's wonderful.
Just a minute.\\
562 - Oh, that's wonderful, Mr. O'Brien!\\
563 - He knows where he can get one, Mr.
O'Brien!\\
564 - (with Irish accent): Faith and
Begorra, that is good news!\\
565 - Uh, yeah, would you, would you call
me back on that?\\
566 - Uh, my name is McGillicuddy.\\
567 - Uh, yes, I'm with the... (mumbling)\\
568 - Television Company.\\
569 - Yes, the telephone number is Murray
Hill 5-9-0-9-9...\\
570 - Yes.\\
571 - Yes, will you call me right back?\\
572 - Thank you.\\
573 - He bit!\\
574 - LUCY AND ETHEL: Hi, Fred.\\
575 - Thought I was pretty dumb, huh?\\
576 - Thought I couldn't make a decent
deal, huh?\\
577 - ETHEL: What happened, Fred?\\
578 - RICKY: What happened, Fred?\\
579 - Well, I'll tell you what happened.\\
580 - I no sooner walked on his lot,\\
581 - then he wanted to buy the car back.\\
582 - Well, you sold it back to him.\\
583 - Just a minute. Just a minute.\\
584 - He offered me $250.\\
585 - Before I could say yes or no, he said
300,\\
586 - 350. He was so anxious, I got
suspicious.\\
587 - But you sold it back to him.\\
588 - Now, just a minute.
Let me tell you, will you?\\
589 - When he got as high as $400,\\
590 - I said that's good enough for me.\\
591 - So you sold it to him and made a
hundred dollars profit.\\
592 - Why, you sly old dog.\\
593 - Did you, Fred?\\
594 - When he said $400, I said to him,\\
595 - "Now, look, Al, I know you.\\
596 - Come clean with me."\\
597 - So, he admitted that\\
598 - some television company was after the
car\\
599 - and had offered $500.\\
600 - They left their telephone number with
them,\\
601 - so that gave us $200 profit.\\
602 - We decided to split.\\
603 - Oh, so he gave you the $400.\\
604 - Well, not exactly. I gave him another
hundred\\
605 - and he gave me the telephone number.\\

\subsection {Episode 12: Lucy Learns to Drive}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Oh...\\
3 - Hi.\\
4 - Oh, hi.\\
5 - What you doing?\\
6 - I'm just checking our luggage for the
trip.\\
7 - This stuff will never make it to
California.\\
8 - Did you ever see anything that looked
so awful?\\
9 - Yeah, Fred.\\
10 - What's the matter with him?\\
11 - Oh, he just can't get over\\
12 - that $400 he lost buying that old
car.\\
13 - No kidding.\\
14 - You ought to see him.\\
15 - He just sits and stares into space,
glassy-eyed.\\
16 - Well, for heaven's sake, I know $400
is a lot of money,\\
17 - but it's nothing to go into a state
of shock over.\\
18 - Oh, you don't know Fred.\\
19 - Once he actually foamed at the mouth\\
20 - when his penny got stuck in a peanut
machine.\\
21 - Oh, not really.\\
22 - I'm telling you, it took two men and
a crowbar\\
23 - to get his hand out of the slot.\\
24 - And you won't believe this.\\
25 - I can't get him to eat anything.\\
26 - Fred won't eat?\\
27 - Oh, he is sick.\\
28 - Gee, honey, there must be something
we can do\\
29 - to snap him out of it.\\
30 - Oh, I've tried everything.\\
31 - You know his friend that runs the
garage\\
32 - on the next block?\\
33 - Joe?		    Joe.\\
34 - Joe said he'd fix up the whole car,\\
35 - so it would run and only charge $20\\
36 - and even that didn't make any
impression on him.\\
37 - (sighing)\\
38 - Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.\\
39 - Will you see what you can do, Lucy?\\
40 - Sure, I'll take a crack at him.\\
41 - I don't know what I could do.\\
42 - Huh.\\
43 - Hi, Fred, you old rascal you.\\
44 - How's every little thing, huh?\\
45 - Fred?\\
46 - Oh, Fred.\\
47 - Um, Fred, I made an apple pie last
night.\\
48 - How would you like a big piece\\
49 - with a big hunk of cheese on it, huh?\\
50 - Does that sound good, Fred?\\
51 - Oh, boy, he's real gone.\\
52 - Isn't that awful?\\
53 - I'll go get the baby, he'll notice
him.\\
54 - Okay.\\
55 - Sit down, Fred.\\
56 - We're going to go see Uncle Fred,
honey.\\
57 - We're going to say hello to Uncle
Fred, huh?\\
58 - There he is.
There's Uncle Fred.\\
59 - Say hi!\\
60 - Say, "Hi, Uncle Fred." Say hi!\\
61 - Hi, hi.
Wave your hand at him.\\
62 - Give him a kiss.
Give him a kiss.\\
63 - Well, I give up.\\
64 - What am I gonna do?\\
65 - I don't know.\\
66 - When he doesn't notice the baby, ugh!\\
67 - He's still warm.\\
68 - Lucy, guess what!\\
69 - Hi.
Hi, Ethel, hi, Fred.\\
70 - Lucy? Where's Lucy?\\
71 - Uh, what-what is it?
What is it?\\
72 - I want her to hear. Lucy!\\
73 - Yeah?
Come here, honey!\\
74 - What?
I bought a new car.\\
75 - A new one?!\\
76 - A brand-new Pontiac.\\
77 - A new Pontiac!
Yeah.\\
78 - You said you couldn't afford a new
car.\\
79 - Yeah, I know, I know, but I started
thinking\\
80 - about the long trip and everything,\\
81 - and I think it's a better investment
anyway.\\
82 - Don't you think so, Fred?\\
83 - Fred?\\
84 - What's the matter with him?\\
85 - He's in a state of shock.\\
86 - It's that $400.\\
87 - Oh.\\
88 - Yeah, it was too much for him.\\
89 - He's retired from reality.\\
90 - He can't hear a word we say.\\
91 - Well, that's too bad\\
92 - because I got wonderful news.\\
93 - What?\\
94 - Well, I used Fred's old Cadillac\\
95 - as a trade-in\\
96 - so Fred will get all his money back.\\
97 - What's that?\\
98 - I think we struck a nerve.\\
99 - What's this about getting my money
back?\\
100 - Well, welcome back to the world,
Fred!\\
101 - Fred, I bought a brand-new car, see?\\
102 - And I, I used your old car as a
trade-in,\\
103 - and the guy allowed me $400 on it.\\
104 - So, all I got to do is give you the
$400\\
105 - and everybody's happy.\\
106 - When do we see the car?\\
107 - Uh, yeah, where is it?\\
108 - When do we eat?\\
109 - He's really recovered.\\
110 - It's right down at the curb right
now.\\
111 - Here? Well, come on, let's go see it.\\
112 - Oh, the baby.
Come on, Fred.\\
113 - Uh, honey, go get Mrs. Trumbull.\\
114 - Ask her to come over for a minute,
will ya?\\
115 - Okay, sure.\\
116 - We'll see you downstairs.\\
117 - Oh, no, you don't! Nobody's gonna see
that car before I do.\\
118 - While we're waiting, how about
something to eat?\\
119 - Now you waited two whole days to eat,\\
120 - you can wait a few minutes longer.\\
121 - Hurry up, Ricky!\\
122 - Oh, Ricky, it's beautiful!\\
123 - Isn't that dreamy?\\
124 - FRED: Oh, what a pip!
Automatic transmission?\\
125 - Naturally.\\
126 - How much horsepower?\\
127 - 180.
Oh, great.\\
128 - Oh, Ethel, smell.\\
129 - There's nothing like the smell of a
new car, huh?\\
130 - Wait till you see the motor, Fred.\\
131 - I want to see it.\\
132 - Look in here.
Yeah.\\
133 - Oh...
Isn't that beautiful...\\
134 - (horn blaring)\\
135 - Oh! What are you trying to do?\\
136 - What's the matter?\\
137 - What's the matter with you?
You crazy or something?\\
138 - Oh, I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry.\\
139 - Come on, let's go for a ride.\\
140 - No, no, no, we can't.\\
141 - LUCY: Why not?
Because we're not insured.\\
142 - Oh. Well, you drove it home.\\
143 - Yeah, I know, but I shouldn't have.\\
144 - I called the insurance man, and he
wasn't in the office.\\
145 - I just couldn't wait any longer to
show it to you.\\
146 - Come on, just once around the block.\\
147 - Yeah, Come on, Rick.	  just once.\\
148 - All right, come on.\\
149 - Just once. Just once.\\
150 - LUCY: Yeah, okay.\\
151 - ETHEL: We're gonna ride all the way
to California!\\
152 - Oh, isn't this great?\\
153 - Oh, come on, honey, hurry up, give me
the keys!\\
154 - Haven't you forgotten something?\\
155 - What?\\
156 - You don't know how to drive.\\
157 - Oh.\\
158 - Hey, Fred, there's some difference in
this\\
159 - and that old relic you bought.\\
160 - FRED: All right, all right.\\
161 - We shouldn't be doing this.\\
162 - Oh, well.\\
163 - We'll go once around the block.\\
164 - LUCY: Yeah. Gee, I hope somebody sees
us.\\
165 - Oh, to California, sitting like this.\\
166 - LUCY: Yeah. Hey, we got a new car!\\
167 - Look everybody, we got a new car!\\
168 - Hey, look!\\
169 - RICKY: Lucy.\\
170 - Yeah?\\
171 - Listen, honey, I got to go down to
the club...\\
172 - What are you doing?\\
173 - Oh, I can't take my eyes off it.\\
174 - That is the most beautiful car in the
whole world.\\
175 - It's pretty, isn't it?\\
176 - Yeah. Take me for another ride.\\
177 - No. We don't move that car until it's
insured.\\
178 - Well, call the man again, go on.\\
179 - All right.\\
180 - You know, I called him four times.\\
181 - He didn't answer any one of the
times.\\
182 - Maybe he's out of town or something.\\
183 - Ricky?
(busy signal)\\
184 - What?\\
185 - When are you gonna teach me to drive?\\
186 - Uh, I got to go to the club.\\
187 - Uh, I'm gonna take the...
the car and show it to the boys,\\
188 - so I can't now.
Well, Good-bye, dear.\\
189 - Now, honey, this is important.\\
190 - If we're gonna live in Los Angeles,\\
191 - I have to know how to drive.\\
192 - Lucy, please, they got enough traffic
problems\\
193 - in Los Angeles already.\\
194 - Now, honey, listen.\\
195 - Suppose we're driving across country.\\
196 - We're in the middle of the desert,\\
197 - miles from anywhere, and you get sick\\
198 - and then Fred gets sick, and Ethel
can't drive\\
199 - and there we are--\\
200 - miles from civilization.\\
201 - It's hot, the sun is pouring down,
it's broiling.\\
202 - We're thirsty, our throats are
parched.\\
203 - Water! Water! Water!\\
204 - (gagging): Water...\\
205 - Oh, oh, if I had only learned to
drive, I could save us all.\\
206 - Water! Water! Wa-ater!\\
207 - Are you getting my message?\\
208 - No.\\
209 - Well, then why didn't you say so?\\
210 - That hurt my throat.\\
211 - Come on, Ricky, say that you'll teach
me to drive!\\
212 - Nope.\\
213 - You'll be sorry, I'm gonna nag you
about this.\\
214 - I'm not gonna let you alone a minute
till you promise me...\\
215 - Okay, okay, okay, okay, I'll tich
you.\\
216 - Well... those are the most beautiful
words\\
217 - I ever heard: "I'll tich you."\\
218 - How come you gave in so quickly?\\
219 - No, I didn't give up quickly.\\
220 - I laid awake all night last night,\\
221 - trying to figure a way out of this.\\
222 - There is none.\\
223 - When can I have my driving lesson?\\
224 - This afternoon?\\
225 - Maybe.\\
226 - Oh, well, I... you know, I
practically know how to drive.\\
227 - I took a couple of lessons in high
school.\\
228 - Well, things have changed a little
since then.\\
229 - Oh, have they?\\
230 - Come here.\\
231 - Here's the name of the man, his phone
number\\
232 - and the all the information you got
to give him.\\
233 - Yeah.
Now, If you can get\\
234 - this guy on the phone before I come
back\\
235 - from the club, I'll give you a lesson
this afternoon.\\
236 - Oh, wonderful! Okay.\\
237 - Good-bye.
Good-bye, dear.\\
238 - Oh, boy!\\
239 - (busy signal)\\
240 - (car approaching)\\
241 - Hi, Ricky, how'd the driving lesson
go?\\
242 - How'd it go, Ricky?\\
243 - (horn beeps)\\
244 - Es imposible.\\
245 - Lo que paso es imposible.\\
246 - No se le puede explicar a nadie lo
que paso hoy en el tunel.\\
247 - iQue horror!\\
248 - iQue barbaridad!\\
249 - Si se lo dice a alguien, no lo creen.\\
250 - Where you going?\\
251 - Huh?\\
252 - Where you going?\\
253 - Oh, uh... I'm going to rehearsal.\\
254 - Oh, aren't you gonna take your car?\\
255 - What was that?\\
256 - Aren't you gonna take your car?\\
257 - No, no. I may never drive again.\\
258 - What's the matter with him?\\
259 - Oh...\\
260 - He got mad at me\\
261 - while I was driving through the
Holland Tunnel.\\
262 - Ricky let you drive through the
Holland Tunnel?\\
263 - Well, he didn't mean to.\\
264 - I got caught in a stream of traffic\\
265 - and I couldn't stop.\\
266 - But you drove all the way through the
Holland Tunnel!\\
267 - Halfway through.\\
268 - What do you mean halfway?\\
269 - Well, Ricky was late for rehearsal\\
270 - and I saw an opportunity to...\\
271 - How was I supposed to know\\
272 - there wasn't room to make a U-turn?\\
273 - You made a U-turn in the Holland
Tunnel?!\\
274 - Oh, brother, that must have been
something.\\
275 - Yeah. The policeman said the cars
were backed up\\
276 - all the way to East Orange, New
Jersey.\\
277 - I'll bet.\\
278 - Where's the baby?\\
279 - Oh, Mrs. Trumbull took him to the
zoo.\\
280 - Oh, good.\\
281 - You know, Ethel,\\
282 - it was awful exciting learning to
drive, though.\\
283 - You should have seen me.\\
284 - I was just like a real professional.\\
285 - I hung my arm out the window, you
know.\\
286 - Oh, boy, I envy you.\\
287 - I always wanted Fred to teach me how
to drive,\\
288 - but we never owned a car.\\
289 - Well, you should learn how to drive.\\
290 - That way, we could take turns driving
across the country.\\
291 - You think so?\\
292 - Sure. This way, you're just so much
dead weight.\\
293 - Well, maybe I'll develop other
talents\\
294 - like folding up road maps\\
295 - and keeping an eye open for clean
restrooms.\\
296 - Oh...\\
297 - Now, honey.\\
298 - No, you really should learn to drive,
though.\\
299 - You know who's gonna teach you?\\
300 - Who?		    Me.\\
301 - You?		Yeah.\\
302 - You just learned this morning.\\
303 - Listen, I drove for a whole hour.\\
304 - Oh, pardon me, Barney Oldfield.\\
305 - Come on, come on, I'll show you how
it goes.\\
306 - Hey, wait!	What?\\
307 - Do you think we ought to drive that
without Ricky's permission?\\
308 - Oh, we're not gonna drive it.\\
309 - You just sit behind the wheel\\
310 - and I'll show you how things work.\\
311 - Sort of a dry run, you know.\\
312 - Okay.\\
313 - Come on. Oh, listen, when we get back
upstairs,\\
314 - remind me to call the man\\
315 - about the insurance for the car, will
you?\\
316 - You mean Ricky let you drive this car\\
317 - and it wasn't insured?!\\
318 - Well, he sort of thought it was
insured.\\
319 - He told me to call the man, but I
couldn't get him\\
320 - and I didn't want to miss my driving
lesson.\\
321 - Lucy!\\
322 - Well, he didn't ask me!\\
323 - Anyway, nothing happened.\\
324 - There's no harm done. Get in.\\
325 - All right.\\
326 - Oh, gee, I never thought this would
happen to me.\\
327 - (laughs)\\
328 - Ooh! Oh, boy, I feel so sporty.\\
329 - (laughing)\\
330 - Now, what do I do?\\
331 - Well, if you had the key, you'd
put...\\
332 - Oh, oh, he left the key in here.\\
333 - What do I do?\\
334 - Just turn the key.\\
335 - Uh-huh.     Turn the key.\\
336 - (engine starts)\\
337 - What was that?\\
338 - Oh, well, nothing to get frightened
now.\\
339 - That's just the motor.\\
340 - Oh.\\
341 - There, now see this gidget here?     
 Yeah.\\
342 - Now, that's neutral, then you put it
in drive,\\
343 - and then you put it in low.\\
344 - See?		Yeah.\\
345 - Now, there's nothing to it really,\\
346 - Isn't that motor quiet, though?\\
347 - It isn't even running.\\
348 - Of course it's running.\\
349 - No, it isn't.\\
350 - Sure it is. Step on the gas, you'll
see.\\
351 - Okay.\\
352 - That it?
Yeah.\\
353 - (engine revving)\\
354 - Oh, Lucy!\\
355 - Put the brake on!
Put the brake on!\\
356 - Oh, Lucy!\\
357 - What's the matter with you, Ethel?\\
358 - I told you not to take it out of
gear.\\
359 - I don't know what a gear is.\\
360 - Oh, for heaven's sake!\\
361 - Oh, our beautiful car!\\
362 - Oh, Ethel, look at that grill!\\
363 - Oh, and it's all my fault.\\
364 - Oh, no, it's my fault.\\
365 - I wanted to teach you to drive.\\
366 - What are we gonna do?\\
367 - Let's hop in the car and head for the
border.\\
368 - No, we got to get these cars apart.\\
369 - And then what?\\
370 - Well, mayeb I can take the Pontiac
down to the garage\\
371 - and get it fixed before Ricky comes
home.\\
372 - Come on, jump up on here.\\
373 - Jump up on here?\\
374 - Yeah, and bounce up and down.\\
375 - You up there?
Yeah.\\
376 - All right.
Now jump up and down.\\
377 - What are we doing this for?\\
378 - I don't know.\\
379 - (metallic clattering)\\
380 - Whenever two cars get stuck together,
the men do it.\\
381 - Oh.\\
382 - Well, it isn't doing any good.\\
383 - No, I guess not.\\
384 - I guess we'll have to drive both cars
to California.\\
385 - Hey, are the keys in the Cadillac?\\
386 - Yeah, They're under the seat.\\
387 - The man's gonna pick it up today.\\
388 - Oh, here they are.\\
389 - What are you gonna do?\\
390 - Listen, do you think\\
391 - if I drove this car to the garage,
that one would follow?\\
392 - Do you know how to drive this?\\
393 - Oh, sure. I learned to drive in a car
like this.\\
394 - This is the gear shift and this is
the brake\\
395 - and this is the clutch.\\
396 - Or is this the brake and this the
clutch?\\
397 - Don't you know?\\
398 - Well, I'll find out as soon as I get
going, you know.\\
399 - How?\\
400 - Well, if I step on the brake,\\
401 - and it doesn't stop, it was the
clutch.\\
402 - Let's go.\\
403 - Okay.\\
404 - Oh, hey, wait a minute.\\
405 - You got to stay here.\\
406 - Stay here?\\
407 - Yeah, and stall everybody off.\\
408 - Wh-Wh-What'll I do?\\
409 - Look. Where's Fred?\\
410 - He's downtown.\\
411 - Look, if Fred comes back,\\
412 - you tell him that the man came for
the Cadillac\\
413 - and that Ricky has the Pontiac
downtown.\\
414 - If the man comes for the Cadillac,\\
415 - you tell him that Fred has it out for
one last farewell spin.\\
416 - If Ricky comes home,\\
417 - you tell him the man came for the
Cadillac\\
418 - and Fred took the Pontiac downtown to
have it washed.\\
419 - Okay?\\
420 - No, you stay here and tell that
story.\\
421 - I'll drive the car to the garage.\\
422 - No, you can't do that.\\
423 - You haven't even soloed yet.\\
424 - Oh. Well, I hope you know what you're
doing.\\
425 - Oh, I hope so, too.
Wish me luck.\\
426 - Good luck.
Okay.\\
427 - Ah.\\
428 - (starter grinding)\\
429 - (starter grinding)\\
430 - (starter grinding)\\
431 - (engine turning over)\\
432 - (backfires twice)\\
433 - (engine sputtering)\\
434 - Take it easy now.\\
435 - Yeah, I will.\\
436 - Be careful.\\
437 - Yeah. Have I got it?\\
438 - Yeah, it's coming.\\
439 - Okay.\\
440 - (engine backfiring and sputtering)\\
441 - Lucy!\\
442 - What happened?\\
443 - You won't believe it.\\
444 - Listen, when you left here,\\
445 - weren't you driving that car and
wasn't this car\\
446 - hooked onto the back of that car?\\
447 - Well, how did, how did that car get
hooked\\
448 - onto the back of this car?\\
449 - It was the most horrible experience
of my life.\\
450 - And I've had some pretty horrible
experiences.\\
451 - I'll bet, Ethel,\\
452 - if I skipped my next henna rinse,\\
453 - I'd find my hair is snow white.\\
454 - Well, tell me what happened.\\
455 - Well, I went to down to the garage to
ask the mechanic\\
456 - how much it would cost to fix the
Pontiac.\\
457 - He said it might be as much as $150.\\
458 - Why $150?\\
459 - Oh, I don't know.
Something's out of line\\
460 - in the front of the Pontiac.\\
461 - So, I didn't have that much money,\\
462 - so I just decided to drive the cars
back here,\\
463 - park them in front of the apartment\\
464 - and just tell Ricky I didn't know how
any of it happened.\\
465 - Well, how did the Cadillac get hooked
onto the back of the...\\
466 - Yeah, I'm coming to that.\\
467 - You know that underpass by Grand
Central Station?\\
468 - Yeah.\\
469 - Well, I was driving on the downhill
side of it\\
470 - and a car started to pass me\\
471 - and it was a new Pontiac just like
our car\\
472 - and the driver was coming awful close\\
473 - so I turned to give him a dirty
look...\\
474 - and no one was driving.\\
475 - No one was driving?\\
476 - So I looked back at our car and it
was gone.\\
477 - It came unhooked, and then what?\\
478 - Well, it passed me at the bottom of
the hill\\
479 - and I didn't know what to do, so I
stopped,\\
480 - and the Pontiac kept on going up the
hill\\
481 - and it didn't quite make it to the
top.\\
482 - (gasping)\\
483 - It didn't?\\
484 - Not much, it didn't.\\
485 - It started rolling backwards and
crashed right into me.\\
486 - You're right, I don't believe it.\\
487 - I wouldn't have believed it either\\
488 - if it hadn't happened to me.\\
489 - What are you gonna say to Ricky?\\
490 - How about good-bye?\\
491 - No, Ethel, our only chance is to
pretend complete innocence.\\
492 - Oh, we'll never get away with it.\\
493 - Well, we'd better get away with it,
or Ricky and Fred\\
494 - will be planting their footprints
somewhere\\
495 - and it won't be Grauman's Chinese
Theatre.\\
496 - Ethel, I wonder how those two cars
got that way.\\
497 - What cars?\\
498 - Here they come.
Here they come.\\
499 - Now, remember, they're gonna scream
and yell at us,\\
500 - but we just have to pretend we don't
know\\
501 - what they're talking about.\\
502 - Just, just act nonchalant.\\
503 - Oh, hi, fellas.\\
504 - Hi, fellas. What's new?\\
505 - How are things down at the club,
dear?\\
506 - Say something.\\
507 - Don't just stare at me!\\
508 - I don't know anything about those
cars!\\
509 - Aha.\\
510 - So, it was you.\\
511 - Us.\\
512 - Look, Lucy, I am trying awfully hard\\
513 - to control my temper,\\
514 - because this time I am afraid to lose
it.\\
515 - Yeah, well, look, I can explain
everything.\\
516 - I wasn't driving the car.\\
517 - I was just showing Ethel how things
work\\
518 - and you left the key\\
519 - and I just showed her how to turn it
on the motor\\
520 - and all of a sudden, the Pontiac
jumped up\\
521 - and rammed the Cadillac\\
522 - and we tried to get the cars apart
and we couldn't.\\
523 - And so then I drove the cars to the
garage.\\
524 - I was gonna get the Pontiac fixed
before you came home\\
525 - and, and well, I went down a hill\\
526 - and a car started to pass me\\
527 - and I stopped and the car went on up
the hill\\
528 - and, and it didn't quite get up to
the top\\
529 - and then it came back downhill and
crashed right into me\\
530 - and I drove the cars home.\\
531 - That's all there is to it.\\
532 - (stifling laughter)\\
533 - (laughing out loud)\\
534 - (laughing uncontrollably)\\
535 - What's so funny?\\
536 - It's so ridiculous.\\
537 - This could only happen to Lucy.\\
538 - Yeah, yeah, just to me.\\
539 - Stupid old me.\\
540 - (laughing)    (guffawing)\\
541 - How can you laugh?!\\
542 - What do you think it's gonna cost us\\
543 - to have those cars fixed?\\
544 - Oh, don't worry about that, Fred, I'm
insured.\\
545 - We've lost Lucy.\\
546 - What's the matter with her?\\
547 - Well, she didn't call the man.\\
548 - Ricky isn't insured.\\
549 - Well, we've lost him, too.\\
550 - Don't worry, Fred.\\
551 - You don't think I was gonna be so
stupid\\
552 - as to let Lucy do it?\\
553 - I called the insurance man myself.\\
554 - You did?\\
555 - Well, we got him back.\\
556 - Now, as far as you are concerned,
young lady...\\
557 - RICKY: Lucy?\\
558 - I don't think you're getting through
to her.\\
559 - Lucy!\\
560 - Maybe she's afraid to come back.\\
561 - Tell her you won't do anything to
her.\\
562 - Lucy, I won't do anything to you.\\
563 - Lucy, I said I wasn't gonna do
anything to you.\\
564 - All right, all right, cross my heart.\\
565 - Hi.\\
566 - But I didn't promise you\\
567 - that I wasn't gonna tell you what I
think about you.\\
568 - Oh. Oh, you're just gonna tell me,
huh?\\
569 - Yeah.\\
570 - Pero no-no-no se donde empezar.\\
571 - Oh.\\
572 - ?Que te pasa?\\
573 - ?Se te perdio el sentido?\\
574 - ?Que tu tienes en la cabeza?\\
575 - ?No tienes nada metido en la cabeza?\\
576 - ?Esta la cabeza muerta?\\
577 - ?No tienes nada aqui completamente?\\
578 - Un dia te voy a coger como si fueras
un pollito\\
579 - y te voy a coger por pescuezito\\
580 - y voy a poner aqui los dedos y...\\
581 - (grunting)\\
582 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
583 - ANNOUNCER: I Love Lucy is a Desilu
Production.\\
584 - Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz\\
585 - will be back next week at this same
time.
\subsection {Episode 13: California, Here We Come!}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Hi.\\
3 - Hi, girl.\\
4 - I brought your mail.\\
5 - Oh, thanks.\\
6 - What are you doing?\\
7 - I'm figuring out the route\\
8 - we're going to take to California.\\
9 - Oh, good.\\
10 - I've got the list of all the places\\
11 - that each of us wants to see.\\
12 - Now, Ricky wants to see New Orleans
and the Rockies,\\
13 - and Fred wants to go to Cincinnati
and Niagara Falls.\\
14 - And I want to see the Ozark Mountains\\
15 - and the Carlsbad Caverns.\\
16 - I know, and we all want to see the
Grand Canyon\\
17 - and Fred says we must not miss Salt
Lake City.\\
18 - Believe me, it's taken some brainwork\\
19 - to figure out an itinerary that'll
please everyone.\\
20 - It's impossible.\\
21 - No, no, it's not impossible.\\
22 - Just takes a little sensible
planning.\\
23 - See?\\
24 - Well, the only thing is,\\
25 - we have to go through New York three
times\\
26 - on the way to Chicago.\\
27 - Oh, fine.\\
28 - Well, we'll just have to fight that
out on the road.\\
29 - Yeah, I guess so.\\
30 - Want to see your mail?\\
31 - Oh, yeah. Anything interesting?\\
32 - Two bills and an ad\\
33 - and a letter from your mother.\\
34 - Oh, what did she say?\\
35 - Now, Lucy, you know I never read your
mail.\\
36 - (snorts derisively)\\
37 - Only postcards\\
38 - and everybody knows they're fair
game.\\
39 - Besides, your mother's letter came to
me.\\
40 - Oh, sure.\\
41 - It did. She enclosed it in a letter
she wrote to me.\\
42 - "Dear Ethel: I lost Lucy's address\\
43 - "and couldn't find it\\
44 - "in the New York phone book.\\
45 - "There are so many Richardsons
listed."\\
46 - Richardson?\\
47 - She never remembers Ricky's last
name.\\
48 - Well, that isn't even close.\\
49 - Yeah, but she's getting better.\\
50 - She refused to admit I was married at
all\\
51 - until after the baby came.\\
52 - Oh, Lucy...\\
53 - (chuckling)\\
54 - Um... "I was able to find your
address\\
55 - "and as you live in the same
building,\\
56 - "I wonder if it would be too much
trouble\\
57 - for you to give the enclosed letter
to her."\\
58 - (sardonic chuckle)\\
59 - She really figures things out,\\
60 - bless her little birdbrain.\\
61 - Well, like mother, like... uh...\\
62 - Oh, uh...\\
63 - What does your letter say?\\
64 - "Dear Lucy: How are you and Micky?"\\
65 - Micky.\\
66 - "I couldn't find your address,\\
67 - "so I'm sending this letter to Ethel
Mertz.\\
68 - "If you don't get it, please let me
know\\
69 - as I have made a copy of it."\\
70 - Well, that's good thinking.\\
71 - "The copy is enclosed."\\
72 - "As a matter of fact, if you have
read this far,\\
73 - "you must have received this letter,\\
74 - so tear up the copy and thank Ethel
for me."\\
75 - Thank you.\\
76 - Oh, it was nothing.\\
77 - "After hearing the good news about
you going west,\\
78 - "I got to thinking how I've never
been any further west\\
79 - than Youngstown, Ohio..." Oh, no!\\
80 - "And this seems like a golden
opportunity\\
81 - for me to get to California."\\
82 - Oh, just wait till Micky Richardson
hears about this.\\
83 - Well, you'll just have to stop her.\\
84 - Too late. Listen to this:\\
85 - "I rented my house to a lovely
couple,\\
86 - "and I bought a whole new wardrobe
for the trip.\\
87 - "Sorry I didn't tell you I was going
with you sooner,\\
88 - "but you know how it is when you're
planning a long trip:\\
89 - "Some little detail is liable to slip
your mind.\\
90 - I remain sincerely yours, Mrs.
McGillicuddy."\\
91 - Mrs. McGillicuddy?\\
92 - That's kind of formal, isn't it?\\
93 - Well, sometimes she forgets who she's
writing to.\\
94 - Well, what are you going to do?\\
95 - Well...\\
96 - there's just one thing to do.\\
97 - What?\\
98 - I'll say "Ricky, my mother is going
to California with us"\\
99 - and then I'll jump out the window.\\
100 - Now, there, for a minute,\\
101 - you were commencing to sound like a
real wife.\\
102 - What do you mean?\\
103 - Well, I like that feeling when you
said,\\
104 - "Ricky, my mother is going to
California with us."\\
105 - Oh, I like that feeling, too.\\
106 - It's what comes after that scares me.\\
107 - Now, you might be surprised at what
would happen\\
108 - if you took a real firm stand with
Ricky.\\
109 - You think so?\\
110 - Sure. Look at the way I handle Fred.\\
111 - Yeah, but you can lick Fred.\\
112 - Oh...\\
113 - You know...\\
114 - maybe you got something there, Ethel.\\
115 - Sure.\\
116 - I'm not going to have my mother
embarrassed.\\
117 - I've got just as many rights around
here as he has.\\
118 - Now you're talking.\\
119 - I'm going to say "Ricky, my mother is
going\\
120 - to California with us and that's
that!"\\
121 - Good girl.\\
122 - That's just what I'll tell him.\\
123 - On the phone.\\
124 - Now, you've got to face him
eventually.\\
125 - Well, this will sort of give me a
head start.\\
126 - Hello, Ricky. I got a letter from my
mother today,\\
127 - and she's going to California with us
and that's that!\\
128 - And I don't want any argument about
it!\\
129 - Hello, Ricky. I got a letter from
Mother today, dear.\\
130 - What are you doing?\\
131 - The line's busy.
I was just practicing.\\
132 - Oh, fine.\\
133 - But I think you're right.\\
134 - The thing to do is be firm.\\
135 - Hello, Ricky. I got a letter from
mother today\\
136 - and she's going to California with us\\
137 - and that's that!\\
138 - And I don't want any argument.\\
139 - What?!	    Do you hear me?!\\
140 - Oh!\\
141 - (yelling in Spanish)\\
142 - (Ricky and Lucy arguing loudly)\\
143 - LUCY: ...don't get excited.\\
144 - Now, please.
Ricky, please, now...\\
145 - (yelling)\\
146 - Mother!\\
147 - (yelling stops)\\
148 - Well!\\
149 - I told you, dear, long before you
ever got married...\\
150 - Well, uh, uh, it's not what you
think, Mother.\\
151 - Uh, uh, Ricky and I were just
rehearsing a... a scene\\
152 - from the picture that he's going to
do out in Hollywood.\\
153 - Weren't we, dear?\\
154 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
155 - Yeah, Mother we were rehearsing, a
scene, that's right.\\
156 - Now, you were very good, sweetie.\\
157 - Thank you.\\
158 - Mother, it's so good to see you.\\
159 - Oh, thank you, dear.\\
160 - Isn't it good to see mother, dear?\\
161 - Yes, yes.\\
162 - Mother?\\
163 - You don't understand any Spanish, do
you?\\
164 - Not a word.\\
165 - Good.\\
166 - Pick up Mother's bags, dear.\\
167 - Oh, yes, sure.\\
168 - Excuse me.\\
169 - Thank you, Micky.\\
170 - You're welcome.\\
171 - Mother, you must be tired.\\
172 - Why don't you sit down.\\
173 - How's everything in Jamestown?\\
174 - Oh, just wonderful.\\
175 - Have you seen Marian von Black?\\
176 - Oh, they moved way up on the Old Hunt
Road.\\
177 - No kidding. Mother, why didn't you
call us from the station?\\
178 - We would have picked you up.\\
179 - Oh, that's all right, dear.
I took the bus.\\
180 - It let me off right in front of the
door.\\
181 - Oh.\\
182 - Wait a minute. The bus doesn't come
down this street.\\
183 - That's what the bus driver tried to
tell me.\\
184 - He was so ridiculous.\\
185 - Well, it was only two blocks out of
his way,\\
186 - and all he had to do was turn the
steering wheel.\\
187 - Do you mean to tell me, you got the
bus driver\\
188 - to leave his route and bring you
right to our door?\\
189 - I made a bargain with him.\\
190 - He promised to bring me here\\
191 - and I promised never to ride on a New
York bus again.\\
192 - I think he made a fine deal for
himself.\\
193 - MOTHER: Well, Micky...\\
194 - I bet you were surprised when Lucy
told you\\
195 - I was going to Hollywood with you.\\
196 - Oh, yeah, yeah.\\
197 - Oh, yeah, I was very surprised.\\
198 - Oh, you know, dear,\\
199 - I hated to give up my club
activities--\\
200 - I'm chairman of the bazaar this
year--\\
201 - and leave my friends, but I figured\\
202 - this was my chance to take it to them
in person.\\
203 - What was that?\\
204 - What?\\
205 - Take what to them in person?\\
206 - My book.\\
207 - Oh, didn't I tell you?\\
208 - I wrote a book.\\
209 - You?\\
210 - Yes.\\
211 - You didn't think I could write, did
you?\\
212 - No. I didn't even know that you could
re...\\
213 - Ricky!\\
214 - Well, Mother,\\
215 - what is your book about?\\
216 - It's the story of our family.\\
217 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
218 - Oh, it should make a wonderful
picture.\\
219 - Yeah, yeah, those screwball comedies
are very successful.\\
220 - Uh, Mother, I wouldn't count too much\\
221 - on selling your book out there, you
know.\\
222 - They have an awful lot of material
floating around.\\
223 - Oh, ordinarily, yes,\\
224 - but now that Micky is a star,\\
225 - he can take my book right to Dore
Schary.\\
226 - Uh, Lucy, dear.\\
227 - What?\\
228 - I would like to rehearse\\
229 - that scene again.\\
230 - Would you step in the next room with
me?\\
231 - No, not now, dear.\\
232 - Yeah, now!\\
233 - No, I want to talk to mother.\\
234 - I'm so glad to see you, Mother.\\
235 - It's been such a long time.\\
236 - Come on in the kitchen.\\
237 - We'll have a nice, long talk.\\
238 - Real long one; maybe three days or
so.\\
239 - Pardon us, dear.\\
240 - There he is. Now, that's Grandma's
little darling.\\
241 - Oh, come on, dear, now we're going to
market.\\
242 - Now, you be a good boy and mind
Grandma, you hear?\\
243 - Mother, please, no c-a-n-d-y.\\
244 - Oh, all right, all right.\\
245 - Here we go.\\
246 - Bye-bye.\\
247 - Lucy?\\
248 - What?\\
249 - Now that we're alone, I'd like to
speak to you.\\
250 - Uh, well, I have some packing to do,
dear.\\
251 - We can talk later.\\
252 - When?\\
253 - Well, when we get out to California.\\
254 - Lucy, I want to speak to you\\
255 - and I want to speak to you now.\\
256 - Now, look, I'm not gonna drive 3,000
miles\\
257 - in the same car with you mother.\\
258 - Do you think three shirts\\
259 - will be enough for you, dear?\\
260 - 'Course not, I need at least a doz...\\
261 - Never mind trying to get me off
track.\\
262 - I don't like the way things are
developing around here.\\
263 - I get a part in a picture.\\
264 - It's all very simple.\\
265 - You and I\\
266 - and little Ricky...\\
267 - Lucy?\\
268 - ...are going to go to Hollywood.\\
269 - And then all of a sudden,\\
270 - everybody that we've ever known is
coming along with us!\\
271 - Oh, they are not.\\
272 - They are, too!\\
273 - Why couldn't we go alone?\\
274 - Now, first you talked the Mertzes
into horning in.\\
275 - LUCY: I did not.\\
276 - That was their own idea.\\
277 - Well, they're tagging along now
anyway.\\
278 - And to top it off,\\
279 - you wanted to take your mother along,
too.\\
280 - Now, Ricky, don't get all excited.\\
281 - Just be sensible.\\
282 - I'm not gonna tell my mother she
can't go\\
283 - when it means so much to her.\\
284 - Well, somebody's got to tell her.\\
285 - Well, you tell her!\\
286 - All right, I'll tell her.\\
287 - Don't you dare!\\
288 - And that's that!\\
289 - What's that?\\
290 - She's going-- that's what's that!\\
291 - (slamming)\\
292 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
293 - Oh, hi, come on in.\\
294 - Why so formal?\\
295 - That's the first time you've rung the
bell in years.\\
296 - RICKY: Hi!\\
297 - What's the matter?\\
298 - We have something to tell you.\\
299 - Yeah.\\
300 - LUCY: What?\\
301 - We can't go on your trip.\\
302 - What?		What?!\\
303 - What are you talking about?\\
304 - We're not going to California,\\
305 - that's what we're talking about.\\
306 - But why?\\
307 - Well, we just changed our mind.\\
308 - We don't feel like going anymore,
that's all.\\
309 - But what happened?\\
310 - Nothing.\\
311 - Nothing at all.\\
312 - You two act like you were sore at
something.\\
313 - Us? Sore?\\
314 - (laughs weakly)\\
315 - Come on, honeybunch.\\
316 - Now, wait a minute, you two.\\
317 - What is the matter?\\
318 - Nothing's the matter.\\
319 - Go ahead and have a nice trip.\\
320 - And don't forget to drop a postcard\\
321 - to Mr. And Mrs.
Fred Horn-in-ski\\
322 - or, as we are more commonly known,
the Tagalong Mertzes!\\
323 - Bon voyage!\\
324 - Well, I hope you're satisfied.\\
325 - Me? What did I do?\\
326 - Ethel heard you!\\
327 - How could she have heard me?!\\
328 - How could she help hearing you\\
329 - with your big mouth and her big
ears?!\\
330 - Now, look, I'm not going to take the
rap for this.\\
331 - I wanted the Mertzes along.\\
332 - You know that.\\
333 - This whole thing wouldn't have
happened\\
334 - if you hadn't insisted to bring your
mother along, too.\\
335 - Honestly, your mother is the most...\\
336 - Hello, mother!\\
337 - (Little Ricky fussing)\\
338 - Oh, darling...\\
339 - Oh, Mother, I told you not to give
him any candy.\\
340 - Oh, is that what you spelled out?\\
341 - Oh...		Oh, now,\\
342 - one little lollipop won't hurt him.\\
343 - And grandma knows what's best for
him, doesn't she?\\
344 - You'd better put him down for his
nap.\\
345 - Okay, dear.\\
346 - Oh, dear.\\
347 - (Little Ricky crying)\\
348 - Who are you calling now?\\
349 - Ethel.\\
350 - Oh.\\
351 - Hello, Ethel.\\
352 - Ethel, listen to me.\\
353 - Ethel, listen!\\
354 - Now, you know Ricky didn't mean that.\\
355 - You know how he is when he gets
excited.\\
356 - Now, listen, if I'd taken half the
things\\
357 - he said to me seriously, I'd have
left him long ago.\\
358 - (click)
What? Hello?\\
359 - Hello?\\
360 - She hung up.\\
361 - Well, I don't blame her.\\
362 - Lucy? Micky?\\
363 - I want to speak to you about
something.\\
364 - What is it, Mother?\\
365 - I didn't say anything in front of the
baby\\
366 - because little pitchers have big
ears.\\
367 - I ran into the Mertzes in the hall.\\
368 - Yes?\\
369 - They told me they're not going to
California and I know why.\\
370 - You do?\\
371 - Yes. It's because of me.\\
372 - Now, just a minute, Mother.\\
373 - It has nothing to do with you.\\
374 - Oh, yes, it has.\\
375 - Everything was all right until I
decided to go.\\
376 - I'm the fly in the ointment.\\
377 - Well, I'm not going.\\
378 - You are, too.\\
379 - Oh, no, I'm not.\\
380 - Ricky...\\
381 - Well, honey, she's made up her mind.\\
382 - You tell my mother she has got to go.\\
383 - Honey, you don't want to force her.\\
384 - That would make her unhappy.\\
385 - All right, let me tell you something.\\
386 - If Mother isn't going, I'm not going.\\
387 - All right, then let me tell you
something.\\
388 - If you're not going, I'm not going.\\
389 - Okay.\\
390 - Okay.\\
391 - (knock at door)\\
392 - May we come in again?\\
393 - Why not?\\
394 - We got to talking it over\\
395 - and we decided we acted pretty
childish.\\
396 - Yeah, we cooled off.\\
397 - We realize that Ricky said what he
did\\
398 - because he was a little upset about
your, uh...\\
399 - But, anyway, he didn't mean it.\\
400 - So, we're going to go on the trip
after all.\\
401 - Well, I hope you have a good time.\\
402 - Send us a postcard when you get out
there.\\
403 - What do you mean?\\
404 - Nobody's going.\\
405 - What's she talking about?\\
406 - We had a beef.\\
407 - The trip has been called off.\\
408 - And it's all my fault.\\
409 - I realized that you weren't going
because of me, so I...\\
410 - Oh, no, honey, that wasn't it at all.\\
411 - We had a little misunderstanding\\
412 - and we just decided to forget it,\\
413 - so now we're going.\\
414 - Are you sure?\\
415 - ETHEL: Sure.\\
416 - Well, I wasn't going to go\\
417 - because you weren't going to if I was
going.\\
418 - But if you're going when I'm going,\\
419 - I might as well go.\\
420 - What did she say?\\
421 - I don't know, but I think she's going
to go.\\
422 - Of course she is.\\
423 - And I wasn't going because she wasn't
going.\\
424 - But if she's going, I might as well
go.\\
425 - So, now everybody's going except,
uh...\\
426 - I'm out of the mood.\\
427 - You four take the trip.\\
428 - Now, Ricky, if you're not going, I'm
not going.\\
429 - But if Lucy's not going, I certainly
am not going.\\
430 - Well, if you three aren't going, we
certainly can't...\\
431 - Wait a minute, wait a minute.\\
432 - Oh, what a bunch of characters I'm
mixed up with.\\
433 - Look, I'm going, everybody's going,\\
434 - Mother's going, everything's fine.\\
435 - Now, the only thing I insist on is an
early start.\\
436 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
437 - So, please pack all your things up
tonight.\\
438 - We're going to leave at 6:00 a.m. in
the morning.\\
439 - (chatting excitedly)\\
440 - Room for all these, Rick?\\
441 - Oh, yeah. It's like a dance hall in
here.\\
442 - Here, give me those.\\
443 - (grunting)\\
444 - This is all the heavy stuff.\\
445 - The girls are bringing down some odds
and ends later.\\
446 - Oh, that's good.\\
447 - Yeah.\\
448 - There we go.\\
449 - Fine.\\
450 - See?
Yeah, easy.\\
451 - How about that, huh?\\
452 - Yeah, how about that?\\
453 - Well, you can always tie a rope on it\\
454 - and drag it along behind.\\
455 - No, we got plenty of room.\\
456 - Yeah, put it over there.\\
457 - I'll just take a couple of these ones
out of there\\
458 - and put it in this.\\
459 - Now what happens?\\
460 - Well, I think if I put this one
first,\\
461 - it'll work out right.\\
462 - Why you put this in here for?\\
463 - I didn't put it in.\\
464 - I did, dear.\\
465 - I was just trying to help.\\
466 - Oh. Well, look, honey, whatever you
got left up there,\\
467 - just put it on the sidewalk\\
468 - and then when we're ready for you,
we'll fit it in, see?\\
469 - Okay. Oh, listen, Mother made
sandwiches\\
470 - so we won't have to stop for lunch.\\
471 - Good!	Well, thanks.\\
472 - 10:00. We're four hours late already.\\
473 - Yeah.\\
474 - I'll get them all out of here.\\
475 - All right.
All right.\\
476 - You can put them down there.\\
477 - Okay. Do you think this will be
enough lunch?\\
478 - Yes.\\
479 - This is a heavy one.\\
480 - Be careful with that.	   Yeah.\\
481 - I'm going to get in here, Fred, and
you hand them to me. See...\\
482 - All right.\\
483 - Okay?	 What do you want first?\\
484 - Give me that big one, Fred.\\
485 - Yeah.		    This?\\
486 - I got it. It's heavy.\\
487 - FRED: This one?\\
488 - Yeah. That's it.\\
489 - This is heavy, too.\\
490 - Careful with that.\\
491 - RICKY: Give me another one.
That one right there.\\
492 - Now what, the fat one?\\
493 - Yeah. Let's try the fat one there.\\
494 - And I'll put this...\\
495 - Watch-- now try it.\\
496 - Back in here, see?\\
497 - FRED: Now, what about this?\\
498 - (Ricky murmuring)\\
499 - That's it.\\
500 - That one...\\
501 - Got it?\\
502 - Yeah.\\
503 - Now, here's a little one, makeup kit.\\
504 - No spot for that?\\
505 - No. I got to take this one out.\\
506 - Turn that around the other way.\\
507 - That way.\\
508 - Next.
Up with that.\\
509 - This one?\\
510 - Now.\\
511 - That little one will now fit in
there.\\
512 - Is that it?\\
513 - Yeah, that's done it.\\
514 - There.\\
515 - (exhaling)\\
516 - Okay.
Ay-ay-ay.\\
517 - (sighing)\\
518 - There we are.
Isn't that great?\\
519 - Yeah.\\
520 - Ahh!\\
521 - What's all this junk?\\
522 - Are they crazy or something?\\
523 - Oh...\\
524 - Oh, no...\\
525 - Lucy, what's all this junk?\\
526 - Junk? This is all necessary stuff.\\
527 - ETHEL: Well, that's it, that's all.\\
528 - Well, we can't take all this stuff.\\
529 - We-we haven't got any more room.\\
530 - Well, make room!\\
531 - It's impossible.\\
532 - What do we do with it?\\
533 - Well, we'll have to live it here,
that's all.\\
534 - "Live" it here?
We need all this.\\
535 - (all talking over each other)\\
536 - (whistling)\\
537 - Wait a minute, will you?\\
538 - Now, I've been sizing this up\\
539 - and I think if we pack it all just
right, we can make it.\\
540 - That's ridiculous.\\
541 - Why don't you let me try?\\
542 - Let him try.\\
543 - Okay, try.\\
544 - Now, Ricky, you go down in the
basement\\
545 - and bring me a nice piece of good,
strong rope.\\
546 - Okay, I'll get you the rope.\\
547 - What do you want us to do, Fred?\\
548 - Go on back in the house and relax,
sit down!\\
549 - Get out of here!\\
550 - Okay.\\
551 - Give me that, will you? Give me that!\\
552 - Give me that.\\
553 - Put that...\\
554 - Go on, get out of here!\\
555 - Go on with the rest of them!\\
556 - All right, this was quite a job,\\
557 - but I know how to pack this kind of
stuff.\\
558 - There it is.\\
559 - Well... now I've seen everything.\\
560 - What's wrong with it?\\
561 - Well, for one thing,\\
562 - I can't see where I'm going.\\
563 - Oh, no, no. I figured that out, too.\\
564 - I left you a nice driving view\\
565 - right down through the middle here.\\
566 - Honestly, I could have loaded it
better\\
567 - with a pitchfork.\\
568 - Our nice Pontiac.\\
569 - It looks like a laundry wagon.\\
570 - Yeah, well, you got to admit, I got
everything in.\\
571 - Well, where are we going?\\
572 - (all complaining)\\
573 - FRED: Get in there. There's plenty of
room in there for...\\
574 - This is the most ridiculous thing
I've...\\
575 - Wait a minute, wait a minute.\\
576 - Wait a minute, everybody.\\
577 - Listen to me.\\
578 - Did it ever occur to any of us\\
579 - that we could send this stuff on
ahead?\\
580 - Of course!\\
581 - What a bunch of jugheads we are!\\
582 - Sure, we'll be on the road two weeks.\\
583 - It'll get there before we do.\\
584 - Oh, dear, are we really going to be
driving\\
585 - for two whole weeks?\\
586 - Well, of course, Mother.\\
587 - It's 3,000 miles,\\
588 - and we're taking all those little
side trips.\\
589 - Well, in that case, there's something
you ought to know.\\
590 - What?\\
591 - I get carsick.\\
592 - That's all, brother.\\
593 - That's all.\\
594 - Oh, Mother, not in this car, you
won't.\\
595 - This, this rides like a dream.\\
596 - ETHEL: Oh, no, it wouldn't happen in
this car.\\
597 - Well, I had no idea it would take two
weeks.\\
598 - It didn't look that far on the map.\\
599 - Oh, mother...\\
600 - I think I'll go by plane.\\
601 - Good!\\
602 - And I think little Ricky should go
with me.\\
603 - The baby?\\
604 - Gee, two weeks is a long time on the
road, Ethel.\\
605 - Yeah.\\
606 - Uh, it doesn't cost hardly anything\\
607 - to send the baby on the plane.\\
608 - What do you think, Ricky?\\
609 - I think it's a wonderful idea.\\
610 - I do, too. I think that's great.\\
611 - Yeah, you take him on the plane.\\
612 - Okay, let's repack the car, huh?\\
613 - Oh, now, just when I got everything
all set!\\
614 - All set for what?!\\
615 - You couldn't even get through the
Holland Tunnel\\
616 - with this mess that you got here!\\
617 - You'd better take this slow while...\\
618 - Pull it all apart...\\
619 - Well, you guys, I just brought you\\
620 - some little goodies to take along
with you.\\
621 - Oh, I'm certainly gonna miss you.\\
622 - Thank you, Mrs. Trumbull.\\
623 - Thank you very, very much.\\
624 - Isn't that dandy?\\
625 - Yeah.\\
626 - Well, let's at least try to get out
of here\\
627 - before it gets dark.\\
628 - Well, Rick, you said...\\
629 - You said you wanted to leave around
6:00,\\
630 - and I think we can just about make
it.\\
631 - Yeah.\\
632 - Now, Mother, you remember,\\
633 - if you have any trouble getting him
to sleep,\\
634 - just sing to him in Spanish, huh?\\
635 - I don't know any Spanish.\\
636 - Oh, well, play one of Ricky's
records.\\
637 - Okay, here we go.\\
638 - LUCY: Okay, good-bye.\\
639 - Bye.
Bye.\\
640 - LUCY: Good-bye, Mrs. Trumbull.\\
641 - Don't forget to collect all the rents\\
642 - on the first of the month.\\
643 - No, I won't.\\
644 - And no matter how much they pound on
the pipes,\\
645 - don't give them any more heat.\\
646 - No, don't worry.
Okay, here we go!\\
647 - I'll take care of everything.\\
648 - Here we go!\\
649 - Wait a minute, honey.\\
650 - Let me kiss the baby once more.
All right.\\
651 - Good-bye, sweetheart.\\
652 - Bye-bye, darling.\\
653 - Have a nice time.
Bye-bye.\\
654 - Good-bye, Lucy!\\
655 - Good-bye, Micky.\\
656 - (all calling out farewells)\\
657 - Bye!\\
658 - Good-bye, son!\\
659 - ETHEL: Bye, honey.\\
660 - Bye, darling.\\
661 - RICKY: Good-bye!\\
662 - LUCY: Bye!\\
663 - RICKY: Bye, son! Take care!\\
664 - RICKY: Bye!\\
665 - ETHEL: Bye-bye! Let's go!\\
666 - (up-tempo music playing)\\
667 - California, here I come\\
668 - Right back where I started from\\
669 - Where bowers of flowers bloom in the
sun\\
670 - (Jolson-like): Yeah!\\
671 - Each morning at dawning, birdies sing
at everything\\
672 - A sun-kissed miss said, "Don't be
late!"\\
673 - That's why I can hardly wait\\
674 - Open up that Golden Gate, California,
here I come\\
675 - Sing it, Freddy.\\
676 - California, here I come\\
677 - (Jolson-like): Yeah!\\
678 - Right back where I started from\\
679 - Sing it, Daddy.\\
680 - Where bowers of flowers bloom in the
sun\\
681 - Each morning at dawning, birdies sing
at everything\\
682 - Tell it.\\
683 - A sun-kissed miss said, "Don't be
late!"\\
684 - Don't be late?
That's why I can hardly wait\\
685 - Open up! Open up! Open up!
Open up that Golden Gate\\
686 - California here I\\
687 - (off key): come!	 come!\\

\subsection {Episode 14: First Stop}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Gee, this is interesting country.\\
3 - I didn't know there were so many
farms in Ohio.\\
4 - Oh, sure.\\
5 - Are you sure this is Ohio?\\
6 - Well, it'd better be.\\
7 - We just left Pennsylvania\\
8 - and we're headed for Indiana.\\
9 - "50 Miles To Aunt Sally's Pecan
Pralines."\\
10 - Well, we're closing in on her!\\
11 - The first sign we saw said,\\
12 - "200 Miles To Aunt Sally's Pecan
Pralines."\\
13 - I'm surprised she has time\\
14 - to make pralines;\\
15 - she's so busy making signs.\\
16 - (guffawing)\\
17 - You know, I've been thinking\\
18 - about those pralines for so many
miles,\\
19 - I just got to have some.\\
20 - How about something to eat? I'm
hungry.\\
21 - Oh, we've got to get more mileage
today, Fred.\\
22 - "Got to get more mileage today,
Fred!"\\
23 - Mileage.\\
24 - Honey, we're all hungry.\\
25 - Well, there'll be plenty of good
places to eat up ahead.\\
26 - "49 miles To Aunt Sally's Pecan
Pralines."\\
27 - Is there anything left\\
28 - in that lunch basket, Ethel?\\
29 - A stale sandwich and a grape.\\
30 - Let me have the grape.\\
31 - Honey, when are you gonna stop and
get something to eat?\\
32 - We're hungry.\\
33 - I'll stop at the next decent town we
come to.\\
34 - Oh, you've been saying that for the
last hour.\\
35 - Yeah.\\
36 - I don't think I'll make it.\\
37 - Me, either.\\
38 - Hey, we still got that stale
sandwich!\\
39 - Don't bother looking in the cupboard,
Mother Hubbard.\\
40 - It's bare.\\
41 - Fred, when did you eat that sandwich?\\
42 - it's not safe to shut your eyes
around here.\\
43 - Wait a minute.\\
44 - "One Mile To Aunt Sally's Pecan
Pralines."\\
45 - That's where we're gonna have dinner!\\
46 - Oh, I can't make a meal out of pecan
pralines.\\
47 - Well, we can at least buy a bag to
munch on\\
48 - until Mr. Mileage here decides to
stop for dinner.\\
49 - Well, that's a thought.\\
50 - Anyway, we just got to drop in on
Aunt Sally.\\
51 - I feel like she's an old friend.\\
52 - "300 Yards To Aunt Sally's"!\\
53 - "200 Yards!"\\
54 - "100 yards!"\\
55 - "Just Around The Bend!"\\
56 - "You Have Just Passed Aunt Sally's."\\
57 - Passed!\\
58 - Where was it?\\
59 - I didn't see a thing!\\
60 - Stop the car, Ricky, back up!\\
61 - Okay.\\
62 - Must be that shed over there.\\
63 - There's a sign on the door,\\
64 - but I can't see it from here.\\
65 - Drive on.\\
66 - What did the sign say?\\
67 - Out of business.\\
68 - I knew Aunt Sally was spending\\
69 - too much money on those signs.\\
70 - Hey, I think I see some lights.\\
71 - Oh, I hope it's a cafe!\\
72 - It is!\\
73 - I hope it's a nice one.\\
74 - Well, we're gonna stop there no
matter what it's like.\\
75 - Really, Ricky?\\
76 - That a boy!
Yeah.\\
77 - I'm hungry, too.\\
78 - Boy, this place doesn't look any too
hot, does it?\\
79 - Well, we're here now, so let's give
it a try, huh?\\
80 - Oh, yeah, food, food.\\
81 - Oh, at least they've got\\
82 - a great big selection of food.\\
83 - Yeah.\\
84 - Hey, I know what I want.\\
85 - One of those steak sandwiches\\
86 - with some French fries and coleslaw.\\
87 - Oh, a steak sandwich!\\
88 - Hiya, folks!\\
89 - Welcome to One Oak.\\
90 - Welcome to One Oak.\\
91 - Cabins and Cafe.\\
92 - Yes, sir.\\
93 - George Skinner at your service.\\
94 - How do you do, Mr. Skinner?\\
95 - Hello. How do you do?\\
96 - What'll it be?\\
97 - Well, I'll have the steak sandwich,
rare,\\
98 - with the French fries.\\
99 - Uh, steak sandwich.
I'll have that, too.\\
100 - I'll have the same.\\
101 - Me, too.\\
102 - We're all out of steak sandwiches.\\
103 - Oh, you are?\\
104 - Gee, I had my mouth all set for one.\\
105 - Yeah.\\
106 - Well... well, I think I'll have\\
107 - the roast beef, rare,\\
108 - with a baked potato, then.\\
109 - Roast beef, that's for me.\\
110 - I'll vote for that.\\
111 - Make it four.\\
112 - We're out of roast beef, too.\\
113 - Let me see here.\\
114 - Hey, that fried chicken\\
115 - with biscuits sounds good.\\
116 - Any point in running that chicken
around the table?\\
117 - All out.\\
118 - Well, look, we're going at this thing
all wrong.\\
119 - Why don't you just tell us what you
have\\
120 - and then we'll order.\\
121 - All righty. How about the specialty
of the house?\\
122 - What's that?\\
123 - A cheese sandwich.\\
124 - A cheese sandwich?\\
125 - Is that all you've got?\\
126 - I don't feel like a cheese sandwich.\\
127 - Well, now, come on, folks, I can't
wait all night.\\
128 - What would you like?\\
129 - The name of the nearest good
restaurant.\\
130 - Lucy, please.
Well...\\
131 - Well, in fact, there is a place ten
miles up the highway\\
132 - called "The Golden Drumstick."\\
133 - The sign says, "Turkey dinner with
all the trimmings,\\
134 - "dressing, cranberry sauce, green
salad\\
135 - and homemade peach shortcake."\\
136 - One dollar.\\
137 - One dollar?\\
138 - And only ten miles from here, you
said? Just ten miles?\\
139 - Right on the highway, you can't miss
it.\\
140 - Oh, homemade peach shortcake!\\
141 - That's for me.\\
142 - Thanks for telling us about it.\\
143 - Thanks a lot, Mr. Skinner.\\
144 - Gee, how can they afford to serve all
that for one dollar?\\
145 - SKINNER: It's impossible.\\
146 - That's why they went broke.\\
147 - And there's not another thing clean
to Cincinnati.\\
148 - Well, group, what do you say?\\
149 - FRED: Well, I'm so hungry I can't go
another mile.\\
150 - ETHEL: Oh, me either.\\
151 - All right, Mr. Skinner.\\
152 - Four specialties of the house.\\
153 - Coming up.\\
154 - Gee, I hope they're good.\\
155 - Well, what can you do to a cheese
sandwich?\\
156 - I, uh, hope you didn't go to too much
trouble.\\
157 - Oh, no trouble.\\
158 - I just buy them from the salesman
when he comes around.\\
159 - That salesman hasn't been around here
lately, has he?\\
160 - Let's get out of here, huh?\\
161 - Yes.\\
162 - Uh, how much do we owe you?\\
163 - Well, let's see.\\
164 - That's four specialties of the house.\\
165 - Here you are.\\
166 - $4.80!\\
167 - Well, uh...\\
168 - the sandwiches are a dollar apiece\\
169 - and 80 cents is the entertainment
tax.\\
170 - Entertainment tax!\\
171 - Yup.\\
172 - The whole show is just about to
start.\\
173 - Ah!\\
174 - (off-key): Baby dear, listen here\\
175 - I'm afraid to go home in the dark\\
176 - Every day, the...\\
177 - I'll pay! I'll pay!\\
178 - I'll pay!\\

182 - Thank you very much.\\
183 - There's your change.\\
184 - Thank you, thank you very much.\\
185 - Happy hunting.\\
186 - FRED: Oh, dear.\\
187 - What a character.\\
188 - "Baby dear"!
Yeah.\\
189 - RICKY: Oh, I sure hate think to drive\\
190 - all the way to Cincinnati now.\\
191 - Well, I'd take the wheel, Rick,\\
192 - but I'm too sleepy.\\
193 - Well, let me drive, Ricky.\\
194 - Well, I don't know, honey.\\
195 - Oh, go on, there's no traffic now.\\
196 - Okay. I'll keep an eye on you.\\
197 - Okay.\\
198 - (Ricky grunting)\\
199 - (engine starts)\\
200 - Next stop, Cincinnati!\\
201 - Here we are.
Wake up, everybody, come on.\\
202 - RICKY (groaning): No.\\
203 - LUCY: Wake up, we're here.
Come on, hurry up.\\

what's going on?\\
211 - What are, what are you doing?\\
212 - Well, I...\\
213 - Oh, we're not back in the same place!\\
214 - We are unless there's a chain of
these across the country.\\
215 - Oh, no.\\
216 - Lucy!\\
217 - Well, I was only trying to help.\\
218 - I saw a sign that said,\\
219 - "Good accommodations, good food"\\
220 - and an arrow saying, "Take this
road."\\
221 - And somehow I wound up back here.\\
222 - Well, as long as we're here,\\
223 - we're in no condition to continue.\\
224 - We'll stay right here.\\
225 - Here?\\
226 - In Lower Slobovia?\\
227 - Look, Fred, there's one good thing\\
228 - about this place.\\
229 - It's here.\\
230 - Let's make the best of it. Come on.\\
231 - I'm afraid to go\\
232 - I'm afraid to go\\
233 - I'm afraid to go...\\
234 - Welcome back, folks.\\
235 - I've been waiting for you.\\
236 - What?\\
237 - That sign I put up really works,
don't it?\\
238 - Takes you right around in a circle.\\
239 - (cackling)\\
240 - Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.\\
241 - Look, uh, uh, we decided to stay here
for the night.\\
242 - We'd like a couple of cabins, please.\\
243 - Well, I've only got one.\\
244 - The price is eight dollars.\\
245 - You only got one left?\\
246 - I've only got one.\\
247 - That's all I ever had.\\
248 - It'll sleep four.\\
249 - Well, let's take it.
I-I'm tired.\\
250 - Well, it's only eight dollars.\\
251 - Well, it'll be 16.\\
252 - Eight dollars a couple.\\
253 - Eight dollars, $16, who cares?\\
254 - Oh, he is tired!\\
255 - Come on.\\
256 - Well, follow me.\\
257 - Go ahead.\\
258 - Well, here we are.\\
259 - Well, back in the car, everybody.\\
260 - Just a minute, just a minute, honey.\\
261 - As long as we're here, we might as
well stay here.\\
262 - Sleep tight.\\
263 - Thanks.\\
264 - Who wants to sleep where?\\
265 - It doesn't matter to me.\\
266 - Me either.\\
267 - Well, all right, all right.\\
268 - We'll take the bunk.\\
269 - Okay.\\
270 - Okay, we'll take the bed.\\
271 - Uh...\\
272 - Maybe we'd better take turns changing\\
273 - in that room, huh?\\
274 - Yeah.	 Yeah.\\
275 - Okay, yeah.	  I'll go first.\\
276 - Oh...\\
277 - I forgot my toothpaste.\\
278 - LUCY: Oh.\\
279 - Hey, honey, this bed doesn't look too
bad.\\
280 - I hope it isn't hard.\\
281 - Whoa!\\
282 - Oh, fine.\\
283 - Well, at least it's a bed.\\
284 - This isn't a bed, it's a canoe.\\
285 - Oh, no!\\
286 - I don't believe this.\\
287 - Come over here, honey.
I'll help you up.\\
288 - (train approaching)\\
289 - What was that?\\
290 - Yeah.\\
291 - (train whistle blowing loudly)\\
292 - (loud, sustained chugging and
rumbling)\\
293 - (train noise intensifying)\\
294 - (train noise subsiding)\\
295 - Ethel, are you all right?\\
296 - Ethel!\\
297 - Ethel, I can't sleep up here.\\
298 - Why not?\\
299 - You know very well that high
altitudes make my nose bleed.\\
300 - High altitudes make him...\\
301 - Oh, why didn't you say so before?\\
302 - Well, I wanted you to warm the bunk
up for me.\\
303 - What a sneaky character I married!\\
304 - Come on!\\
305 - All right, all right.\\
306 - Get on...
Get in there.\\
307 - Can't get out under here.\\
308 - I just don't like you being so
tricky.\\
309 - (chuckles)\\
310 - (chuckles)\\
311 - Oh, Lucy, Lucy!\\
312 - Oh, oh!\\
313 - Ouch!\\
314 - You okay?\\
315 - You all right?\\
316 - Yes.\\
317 - Ricky, what side of the bed do you
want to sleep on, honey?\\
318 - I don't care.\\
319 - Okay.\\
320 - Hey, get over on your own side of the
bed.\\
321 - Well, that's easier said than done.\\
322 - Ahh!\\
323 - Oh!\\
324 - What are we gonna do, honey?\\
325 - I don't know.\\
326 - (train whistle blowing)\\
327 - It's another train.\\
328 - It must be another train.\\
329 - (engine roaring and rumbling)\\
330 - (noise intensifying)\\
331 - (train noise subsiding)\\
332 - What are you doing over here?\\
333 - Come on, let's push the bed back.\\
334 - Wait a minute.\\
335 - Here comes another train the other
way.\\
336 - It's coming the other way now!\\
337 - Coming again.\\
338 - (loud, sustained chugging and
rumbling)\\
339 - (train noise intensifying)\\
340 - (train whistle blowing loudly)\\
341 - (engine roaring and rumbling)\\
342 - (train noise subsiding)\\
343 - I wonder if this bed stops in
Chicago.\\
344 - Let's try to get some sleep.\\
345 - Maybe that was the last one.\\
346 - Where's my pillow?\\
347 - Right here.\\
348 - Okay.\\
349 - Ahh!\\
350 - (grunts)\\
351 - I can't sleep in this hole!\\
352 - Rick, Rick, What?\\
353 - our mattress is just like that at
home.\\
354 - We'll trade with you.\\
355 - Are you sure?\\
356 - Yeah, yeah, I know. Come on.\\
357 - Come on, we'll trade.\\
358 - Thank you, honey.\\
359 - Thank you very much.\\
360 - Whoa!\\
361 - FRED: What's going on?
What...\\
362 - ETHEL: Get up, Fred.\\
363 - What?
Get up.\\
364 - We're gonna trade with them.\\
365 - Get up for what?
Come on, come on.\\
366 - Oh... what...
Come on.\\
367 - You take the bed now.\\
368 - Take the bed.\\
369 - Lie down.\\
370 - No, wait just a minute now. Come on.\\
371 - Now! Go!\\
372 - Hey!\\
373 - You do that every night?\\
374 - Yeah, but it took years of practice.\\
375 - (cat yowling)\\
376 - Ricky... Ricky.\\
377 - Hmm?\\
378 - The baby's crying.\\
379 - See what's the matter with him.\\
380 - Okay, honey.\\
381 - No... I don't know what we're gonna
do.\\
382 - (train approaching)\\
383 - Hold on, everybody, hold on!\\
384 - Here it comes, the next one.\\
385 - (train passing by)\\
386 - Here it comes!\\
387 - (train whistle blowing loudly)\\
388 - (loud chugging and rumbling)\\
389 - (noise intensifying)\\
390 - (train noise subsiding)\\
391 - I don't know about you, but I'm
getting out of here!\\
392 - Me, too, I'd rather sleep in the car.\\
393 - $16 down the drain.\\
394 - Oh, no, I'm not gonna pay him $16 for
this.\\
395 - I'm gonna sue him for renting it to
us.\\
396 - Yeah.\\
397 - You mean we're gonna sneak out of
here?\\
398 - Yeah, he'll never know!\\
399 - Come on, get your coat out.\\
400 - Fred, wake up!\\
401 - Wake up, Fred!\\
402 - Fred, wake up!
Fred!\\
403 - Is it morning already?\\
404 - No, come on.\\
405 - How can he sleep through all that?\\
406 - Somebody tied a string to the car.\\
407 - What's the matter?\\
408 - I don't know. Somebody tied a string
here.\\
409 - Bust it.\\
410 - Yeah.\\
411 - (sirens wailing, alarms blaring)\\
412 - It's all right, honey.\\
413 - It's all right, honey.\\
414 - Oh!
It's all right.\\
415 - He had a burglar alarm hooked up in
there.\\
416 - I feel like I'm breaking out of
prison.\\
417 - Let's get out of here.
Come on, let's go.\\
418 - FRED: Yeah, come on, jump in, honey.\\
419 - Oh, no.
Huh?\\
420 - What's the matter?\\
421 - Our steering wheel is missing.\\
422 - It's gone!\\
423 - Our steering wheel is gone!\\
424 - You folks lose something?\\
425 - You give us back our steering wheel!\\
426 - Your steering wheel?\\
427 - I don't know what you're talking
about.\\
428 - You do, too! You took it off just to
keep us here!\\
429 - Well, you-you-you've got an awful
suspicious mind\\
430 - to think that we'd try to get away\\
431 - in the middle of the night.  
(whistling)\\
432 - What kind of people\\
433 - do you think we are anyway?!	    
Lucy...\\
434 - Hey, hey, honey, honey, we..\\
435 - Yeah, well...
Oh, Oh.\\
436 - What made you think we'd sneak away?\\
437 - Well, everybody does.\\
438 - You know, if you didn't like that
cabin,\\
439 - you don't have to pay me the $16.\\
440 - Really? 	 Oh, well, uh...\\
441 - Well, gee, that's very nice of you.\\
442 - That's a rotten shame\\
443 - your steering wheel being stolen.\\
444 - You know, I just happen to have an
extra one here.\\
445 - I'll let you have it for $16.\\

\subsection {Episode 15: Tennessee Bound}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Lucy, I tell you, we're lost.\\
3 - Shh!\\
4 - You want to wake them up?\\
5 - We are not lost.\\
6 - Well, then, Highway 60's lost.\\
7 - None of the roads we've been on\\
8 - for the last hour are even on the
map.\\
9 - I'll bet we're either in Canada or
Mexico.\\
10 - Oh, Ethel, stop.\\
11 - The service station man\\
12 - will tell us how to get back on the
highway.\\
13 - Well, where is he?\\
14 - I don't know.\\
15 - Howdy, folks.
How are ya?\\
16 - Shh!\\
17 - FRED: I heard you.
I heard you.\\
18 - RICKY: What? What? What?\\
19 - Eh, what can I do for you?\\
20 - FRED: Where are we?\\
21 - RICKY: What's the matter?\\
22 - Uh, nothing's the matter, dear.\\
23 - Everything's fine.
We just stopped for some gas.\\
24 - Go back to sleep.\\
25 - Well, this ain't no gas station.\\
26 - I live here.\\
27 - You live here?\\
28 - Yep. For the past seven years,\\
29 - ever since they condemned this road.\\
30 - Oh.\\
31 - RICKY: Lucy, where are we?\\
32 - Uh, uh,... where are we?\\
33 - Uh, where are we, Ethel?\\
34 - Oh, uh...\\
35 - I don't know.\\
36 - I wasn't paying much attention.\\
37 - Shucks, you're in Tennessee.\\
38 - Tennessee?\\
39 - Tennessee?\\
40 - RICKY: Tennessee?\\
41 - FRED: Tennessee?\\
42 - You got here from Highway 60?!\\
43 - Yeah.\\
44 - But there ain't no roads.\\
45 - Hey, you must have come across that
mountain\\
46 - in them old loggin' ruts.\\
47 - How'd you do it?\\
48 - 'Tweren't easy.\\
49 - Tell me, uh, where is the next city?\\
50 - Well, uh, you can get to Nashville
from here.\\
51 - You-you go straight down here a piece\\
52 - un-until you get to that big road\\
53 - and you stay right on it\\
54 - and it'll take you right through Bent
Fork.\\
55 - Mm-hmm.\\
56 - Bent Fork?\\
57 - Bent Fork?\\
58 - Bent Fork?\\
59 - FRED: Bent Fork?\\
60 - There goes that echo again.\\
61 - Yeah, well, back over those old
loggin' ruts.\\
62 - Oh, no, Lucy.\\
63 - Listen, Ethel,\\
64 - Bent Fork is Ernie Ford's hometown.\\
65 - If we run into him, we'll never get
to California.\\
66 - Hey, do you folks know my cousin
Ernie?\\
67 - Oh, yeah, we know him.\\
68 - He stayed overnight with us for a
couple of weeks once.\\
69 - Well, don't you like him?\\
70 - Oh, we love him,\\
71 - but, uh, we, uh we don't want to run
into him.\\
72 - He'd make us, uh, move right in.\\
73 - Well, Cousin Ernie's like that.\\
74 - Yeah.\\
75 - Yeah, well, look, uh,\\
76 - is there any other way to get back to
civilization\\
77 - without having to go through Bent
Fork?\\
78 - Well... uh, let's see.\\
79 - You're here.\\
80 - You're gonna...\\
81 - Nope. You can't get there.\\
82 - Okay, come on, I'll drive.\\
83 - Let's go.\\
84 - What do you mean, you'll drive?\\
85 - We're not taking any chances.\\
86 - We're gonna go through Bent Fork,\\
87 - but as Cousin Ernie would say, "We're
going through\\
88 - like a bobcat with a burr under his
tail."\\
89 - Now get!\\
90 - That's the most ridiculous thing I
ever heard of.\\
91 - Shh!\\
92 - We were not speeding at all.\\
93 - You have no right to arrest us!\\
94 - Yeah, well, that'll be up to the
sheriff.\\
95 - Yeah, well, we'll just see\\
96 - what the sheriff has to say about
this.\\
97 - It's just our word against yours, you
know?\\
98 - I got to make up my report.\\
99 - Yeah, well...\\
100 - Now, look, honey, I know these little
towns.\\
101 - Now, the best thing for us to do is
say we're guilty,\\
102 - pay the fine and get out of here.\\
103 - He's right, Lucy.\\
104 - No! It's a matter of principle!\\
105 - Never mind that.\\
106 - There we are.\\
107 - There's the report.\\
108 - You see, uh, I'm not, uh, normally
the arresting officer.\\
109 - He's sick today.\\
110 - I'm normally the sheriff.\\
111 - Eww!\\
112 - I'll handle this.\\
113 - Now, uh, let's see here.\\
114 - According to this report,\\
115 - by the officer who arrested you...\\
116 - Oh, that's all, brother.\\
117 - Now, just a minute, young lady.\\
118 - This is a court of law and order\\
119 - and I'm aiming to run it\\
120 - as honest as is humanly possible.\\
121 - Ha!\\
122 - Now, you're charged with driving
lickety-split\\
123 - down the main road of Bent Fork at 40
miles an hour.\\
124 - Guilty or not guilty?\\
125 - Guilty.\\
126 - Not guilty.\\
127 - (angry grunt)\\
128 - That's impossible.\\
129 - You was in the same car, wasn't you?\\
130 - Was your side of the car going slower
than his'n?\\
131 - No. My side was going the same speed
as his'n.\\
132 - Was you a-driving?\\
133 - No.\\
134 - Well, then hesh up.\\
135 - I won't hesh up.\\
136 - Hesh up!\\
137 - I won't!\\
138 - I just happened to be looking\\
139 - at the speedometer at the time\\
140 - and we were not going 40 miles an
hour!\\
141 - Oh, is that so?\\
142 - Well, now, how fast would you say you
were driving?\\
143 - Well... uh...\\
144 - Let me help you. 35?\\
145 - Less.\\
146 - Thirty-four.\\
147 - Thirty-three?\\
148 - Thirty.\\
149 - Well, you wasn't backing through
town, was you?\\
150 - No. 30 Sounds about right.\\
151 - I mean, 30.\\
152 - That's what it was. 30.\\
153 - All right. Now I wasn't brung up\\
154 - to doubt the word of a lady.\\
155 - If you say it's 30, 30 it is.\\
156 - Well, that's better.\\
157 - All right. The charge now reads\\
158 - going through town at 30 miles an
hour.\\
159 - That's right.\\
160 - Well, the speed limit is 15 miles an
hour.\\
161 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
162 - The fine will be $50.\\
163 - $50?!		$50?!\\
164 - You tourists got to learn not to go
boring through here\\
165 - like you was the governor with a
police escort.\\
166 - All right. Here.\\
167 - Don't you pay that.
Shh!\\
168 - Now, looka here, young lady.\\
169 - Don't you get my dander up.\\
170 - Well, you've got my dander up!\\
171 - You have no right to fine us $50!\\
172 - That's enough!\\
173 - If you so much as say "boo",\\
174 - I'm going to waltz you right into the
pokey.\\
175 - Here. Come on, let's go.\\
176 - All right.\\
177 - Boo.\\
178 - Are you crazy or something?!\\
179 - Into the cooler you go for 24 hours.\\
180 - Oh, now wait a minute.\\
181 - You can't mean that.\\
182 - I certainly do.\\
183 - Oh, she just does things like that
all the time.\\
184 - She hasn't got much sense.\\
185 - Yeah, well...\\
186 - Come on.\\
187 - Oh... Ricky!\\
188 - What do you want me to do?!\\
189 - Well, call Ernie Ford.\\
190 - Oh?\\
191 - Do you know Ernie Ford?\\
192 - Well, we certainly do, don't we?!\\
193 - RICKY: Oh, yeah.\\
194 - ETHEL: Good old Cousin Ernie.\\
195 - He's one of our best friends.\\
196 - Yeah, yeah.
Do you know him?\\
197 - I should say I do.\\
198 - Well, how about that?!\\
199 - He knows Cousin Ernie.\\
200 - Yeah, fine, fine.\\
201 - Yes, sir.\\
202 - That no-account hound dog.\\
203 - He jilted one of my daughters,\\
204 - and since you're such a good friend
of his'n,\\
205 - you can just set in there for 48
hours!\\
206 - Come on.\\
207 - Right in here.\\
208 - (door slamming)\\
209 - Well, there's just one thing to do,
Ricky.\\
210 - Go on without me.\\
211 - Oh, now, honey, don't be silly.\\
212 - Go ahead. You could send me a
postcard now and then,\\
213 - and tell me what Hollywood is like\\
214 - and Ethel, say hello to Clark Gable
for me.\\
215 - Maybe on your way back, you could
stop,\\
216 - and by that time, I'll be paroled.\\
217 - Oh, now, honey, don't feel that way.\\
218 - We'll think of something, honey.
Don't worry.\\
219 - ERNIE: Gee, folks! Howdy-do?!\\
220 - Ernie!\\
221 - Hey!\\
222 - Cousin Fred.\\
223 - Hi, Ernie.\\
224 - Cousin Ethel.\\
225 - Cousin Ricky.\\
226 - Hi, Ernie.\\
227 - And Cousin Jailbird.\\
228 - Hi, Ernie. How'd you know we were
here?\\
229 - Oh, it's the biggest news in town.\\
230 - Oh, you're all over town.\\
231 - Biggest news since the preacher
dropped his uppers in the well.\\
232 - Ernie, we're in an awful mess.\\
233 - The sheriff put Lucy in jail for 48
hours for being sassy.\\
234 - Yeah, I couldn't help it.\\
235 - He made me so mad.\\
236 - Well, he makes everybody mad.\\
237 - He's about as popular as a skunk at
the picnic.\\
238 - Well, he doesn't seem to like you
very well.\\
239 - Listen, have you got any ideas\\
240 - on how we could get Lucy out of jail?\\
241 - Don't you worry, amigo.\\
242 - Like the United States Murines,\\
243 - I have come prepared.\\
244 - Prepared for what, Ernie?\\
245 - Shh.\\
246 - (humming)\\
247 - Don't cut yourself now.\\
248 - There.\\
249 - There.\\
250 - What do you want us to do with these?\\
251 - Saw through them bars.\\
252 - Oh, that'll never work.\\
253 - Cousin Fred, it is time\\
254 - for desperate measures.\\
255 - You've heard of being up the creek

out.\\
276 - Hesh up, you coward.\\
277 - Hmm.\\
278 - Any law against serenading a cousin
in your pokey?\\
279 - No.\\
280 - No more than there's a law against a
weasel\\
281 - breaking his word to womanhood's
fairest flower.\\
282 - That'll stick in old sour-jaw's craw\\
283 - the rest of his living days.\\
284 - Now, look, here's what we're gonna
do. Come here.\\
285 - Lucy, you work with her. I'm going to

338 - Oh, good, good.\\
339 - Folks, not weasels.\\
340 - Yeah.\\
341 - You liked, you liked the song, eh?\\
342 - Oh, I liked it fine, yeah.\\

Sheriff.\\
345 - ALL: Yeah.\\
346 - (operatically): Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay...\\
347 - That's awfully nice of you,\\
348 - but, uh, I feel a little guilty.\\
349 - I-I was a little, uh, hot-headed\\
350 - back there a while ago.\\
351 - I'm sorry. I'm gonna let the little
lady out.\\
352 - You are?\\
353 - Yeah.\\
354 - Out of the way, weasel.\\
355 - (muttering)\\
356 - There you are, young lady...\\

360 - Birmingham Jail\\
361 - Ernie.
Birming...\\
362 - Ernie.
Huh?\\
363 - Look, cousin, would you mind stop
singing a minute?\\
364 - I like your voice and everything,\\
365 - but, you know, I'm kind of upset.\\
366 - Well, you ain't half as upset as I
am.\\
367 - You can lay the blame for this whole
mess\\
368 - right on my front doorstoop.\\
369 - Aw, Ernie, you mustn't feel that way.\\
370 - Well, I do.\\
371 - Here you drive all the way down here
to Bent Fork to see me\\
372 - and you was all teeth to see your old
cousin again\\
373 - and you just come a-thunderin' into
town\\
374 - like a runaway mule train, and what
happens?\\
375 - You get yourself arrested.\\
376 - Now, ain't that the cotton-pickin'
end?\\
377 - Yeah, that's the cotton-pickin' end.\\
378 - Now, look, it's my fault.\\
379 - I got you into it\\
380 - and I'm gonna hatch up something\\
381 - to get you out of it.\\
382 - Roses love sunshine, violets love
dew...\\
383 - Ernie? Ernie?\\
384 - Huh?\\
385 - Do you have to cackle while you
hatch?\\
386 - Cousin Fred, I can't help it.\\
387 - Singing is the way I get my brain
cells to leaping.\\
388 - I'm a-singin' on the outside,\\
389 - but I'm a-thinkin' on the inside.\\
390 - Angels in heaven, oh...\\
391 - Ha!\\
392 - What? What?\\
393 - I got it, I got it.\\
394 - In just a few minutes,\\
395 - you're going to be breathing the free
air\\
396 - of Bent Fork once again.\\
397 - Well, what are you gonna do?\\
398 - Oh, let me tell you something.\\
399 - I'm a-gonna marry the sheriff's
daughter.\\
400 - ETHEL: Oh, no.\\
401 - Oh, Ernie, you'd do that just for us?\\
402 - Yeah, well, it won't be so bad.\\
403 - Teensy's kind of pretty--\\
404 - Teensy, that's her name-- oh, she's
got skin\\
405 - like fresh-churned buttermilk.\\
406 - Well, it doesn't sound so bad.\\
407 - Well, she's not bad...\\
408 - Come on, girls.\\
409 - Teensy, Weensy, come on.\\
410 - Daddy, yes, Daddy.\\
411 - You can't do it, boy!\\
412 - You can't do it!\\
413 - I won't let you, boy.\\
414 - I said I's a-gonna do it\\
415 - and I'm a-gonna do it.\\
416 - (all protesting)\\
417 - Sheriff! Sheriff!\\
418 - (clamoring)
Sheriff!!\\
419 - What's the matter?\\
420 - Hush up!\\
421 - What's all this caterwaulin'?\\
422 - Nothing, Sheriff.\\
423 - Nothing.
Just playing a game.\\
424 - I want to talk to you.\\
425 - I ain't got nothing to say to you.\\
426 - It's about your daughter's future.\\
427 - Huh?\\
428 - Well...\\
429 - Come on out.\\
430 - (door slamming shut)\\
431 - There. Now, what was it\\
432 - you wanted to talk about, son?\\
433 - See here. Come on into my office,
Ernie boy.\\
434 - (giggling and chattering)\\
435 - Hi, Ernie.\\
436 - Hi.\\
437 - Is it all over?\\
438 - Yup.\\
439 - What happened?\\
440 - Well, I went in there\\
441 - and I took Teensy aside, and I
proposed to her.\\
442 - Oh, Ernie.\\
443 - And I was that surprised when she
turned me down.\\
444 - What? She turned you down?\\
445 - Yeah.\\
446 - Why?\\
447 - It was Weensy\\
448 - and she can't stand the sight of me.\\
449 - Oh, well, how did that happen?\\
450 - Well, I had a hold of the wrong one.\\
451 - They're as alike as two peas in a pod\\
452 - or two watermelons in a patch.\\
453 - So, when I seen that I had a hold of
Weensy\\
454 - I turned her loose, walked right
around her--\\
455 - which is no small trip--\\
456 - and I proposed to Teensy,\\
457 - and she turned me down.\\
458 - She said, "I ain't a-gonna play
second fiddle."\\
459 - Oh.	  Oh.\\
460 - Well, what do we do now?\\
461 - Well, now, here's the way I've corked
the jug.\\
462 - Now, now, Weensy and Teensy are just
a-dyin'\\
463 - to get into the movin' pictures\\
464 - and, huh, they're just made for the
wide screen.\\
465 - Yeah?\\
466 - So, I told the sheriff that you'd
just be delighted\\
467 - to haul them into Hollerwood with
you.\\
468 - What? Ernie, we can't do that.\\
469 - Oh, Ernie!\\
470 - You can't?\\
471 - Of course not.\\
472 - That's out of the question.\\
473 - Oh, and the sheriff's out here,\\
474 - inviting everybody in the county\\
475 - for a big farewell party for the
girls.\\
476 - Oh, Ernie, we couldn't do that.\\
477 - Ernie, go... go get him, will you?\\
478 - Tell him to call it off!\\
479 - (all clamoring)\\
480 - Hey, have you any idea where the
sheriff might be?\\
481 - Nope.\\
482 - "Nope."\\
483 - ERNIE: Ooh-whee!\\
484 - Ernie, oh, boy, am I glad to see you.\\
485 - Did you find him, Ernie, huh?\\
486 - No, I didn't find him.\\
487 - I got me a horse, and I followed him\\
488 - from farm to farm, and I never did
catch him.\\
489 - Past hour, I've been a-ridin' on a
solid blister.\\
490 - You can call me "tall in the saddle."\\
491 - Oh, what are we gonna do?\\
492 - Hey, hey, here comes the music
fellas!\\
493 - RICKY: Oh, the music fellas, they got
the whole thing...\\
494 - Hey, boys, come here, come here.\\

501 - Oh, Sheriff, Sheriff...\\
502 - He won't...

503 - Oh, say, I'm sorry.\\
504 - I'm sorry. I was so excited about the
party\\
505 - an-and losing my two daughters\\
506 - that I plumb forgot to let you loose.\\
507 - Yeah, but look, Sheriff, look.\\
508 - Come here a minute, would you?\\
509 - I want to speak Yeah?	    to you.
Look,\\
510 - I didn't tell Ernie\\
511 - that I was going to take the girls to
Hollywood.\\
512 - As a matter of fact...\\
513 - Well, just a minute there.\\
514 - I don't blame you a mite, son.\\
515 - You haven't seen them perform.\\
516 - You just want to be sure they got
talent, eh?\\

524 - Would you just listen for a minute?\\
525 - Please, please, listen.\\
526 - A-one, two, three, four.\\
527 - (music begins)\\
528 - They warned me when you kissed me\\
529 - Your love would ricochet\\
530 - Aha!\\
531 - Your lips would find another\\
532 - And your heart would go astray\\
533 - I thought that I could hold you\\
534 - With all my many charms\\
535 - But then one day you ricocheted\\
536 - To someone else's arms\\
537 - And, baby\\
538 - I don't want a ricochet romance\\
539 - I don't want a ricochet love\\
540 - If you're careless with your kisses\\
541 - Find another turtledove\\
542 - I can't live on ricochet romance\\
543 - No, no, not me\\
544 - If you're gonna ricochet, baby\\
545 - I'm gonna set you free.\\
546 - Ha, ha. Yay.\\
547 - Fine, dear, fine.\\
548 - Well, uh, Mr. Ricardo?\\
549 - Well, uh, yeah, well, um...\\
550 - Yeah, it's gonna be a little
difficult\\
551 - to 'splain to you this, Sheriff.\\
552 - Sheriff, you see, it's got nothing to
do with the girls.\\
553 - You see, this is the first time\\
554 - that I'm going out to Hollywood
myself.\\
555 - I-I don't know anybody out there.\\
556 - I don't even know anything about the
place or...\\

558 - What are you trying to get at?\\
559 - Well, Sheriff, I'm trying to tell you\\
560 - that I cannot possibly take your
girls with me.\\
561 - What?!\\
562 - I tried to tell you before, but
you...\\
563 - All right, well, maybe you'll change
your mind,\\
564 - cooling your heels for 20 or 30 days.\\

105 - (doorbell buzzing insistently)\\
106 - (knocking at door)\\
107 - Ah!	    Oh!\\
108 - Daddy, oh!\\
109 - My little Ethel Mae!\\
110 - I'm so glad to see you!\\
111 - I can't believe it's you!\\
112 - I thought we'd never get here.\\
113 - My, my, you're a sight for sore eyes.\\
114 - Oh... Daddy...
you remember Fred.\\
115 - Huh? Oh, yeah.\\
116 - Hiya, curly.\\
117 - And, uh, these are my best friends,
the Ricardos.\\
118 - How do you do, Mr. Potter?\\
119 - How do you do?\\
120 - You must be Lucy.\\
121 - Now, there's a shrewd piece of
deduction.\\
122 - And Ricky!\\
123 - Yes, sir.\\
124 - ?Como esa?\\
125 - ?Como esta? Very good.\\
126 - Oh, I've heard a lot about you.\\
127 - Really?\\
128 - Yes.\\
129 - Well...\\
130 - Thank you.\\
131 - Well, let's all sit down, get the
load off our feet.\\
132 - Okay, sure.\\
133 - You sit there, Fred. You sit anyplace
you want to\\
134 - and you sit right by me.\\
135 - All right, honey.\\
136 - Oh, I thought we'd never get here
from Amarillo.\\
137 - Oh, it's been such a long day.\\
138 - Ethel, is this you?\\
139 - Yep. That's my baby\\
140 - when she was the flower of
Albuquerque--\\
141 - the most popular girl in town.\\
142 - Why, they even elected her Miss
Albuquerque of 19...\\
143 - Daddy.		Huh?\\
144 - She was pretty popular, huh, Mr.
Potter?\\
145 - Popular? Ha!\\
146 - She was so popular,\\
147 - the boys used to buzz around her like
bees around honey.\\
148 - (Lucy laughing)\\
149 - She could have had her pick of any
fella in town.\\
150 - And when I stop to think how she...\\
151 - Oh, what's the use of going back?\\
152 - Well, how come, with all the bees
around her,\\
153 - I was the one that get stung?\\
154 - Stung? Now, look here, you...\\
155 - Daddy, Daddy...
Fred, please don't..\\
156 - Mr. Potter, uh, uh, this is the first
time\\
157 - that we've been around this part of
the country, you know.\\
158 - Yes. We've never been down--\\
159 - even around Albuquerque at all.\\
160 - Really?
Yeah.\\
161 - You know very well she was popular.\\
162 - Why, she could have married the best
of them.\\
163 - There was that Deke, Deke...
What's his name?\\
164 - Deke Arledge.\\
165 - Yeah, and Hank Spear and Bill
Hackett.\\
166 - Oh, say, he's the editor of the paper
now.\\
167 - He is?!\\
168 - Oh, I almost forgot.\\
169 - He's coming over.\\
170 - He'll be here in a few minutes.\\
171 - Billy Hackett?\\
172 - Yeah, Billy Hackett.\\
173 - Oh...
Yes, sir.\\
174 - When I told him that you were coming
through town\\
175 - with the Ricardos, nothing would do\\
176 - but that he'd come over and get an
interview.\\
177 - (laughing): Really?\\
178 - Yeah. Oh, the whole town's in an
uproar over this visit.\\
179 - Is that so?\\
180 - I even got so excited, I didn't go to
the store this morning.\\
181 - I run a little sweetshop and soda
fountain.\\
182 - Yeah, our slogan is,\\
183 - "You can lick our cones, but you
can't beat our sodas."\\
184 - (all guffawing)\\
185 - Yeah, it isn't every day\\
186 - when we get a celebrity that comes to
our town.\\
187 - (chuckling): Oh, well...\\
188 - I hope that they're not gonna make,
uh,\\
189 - too much of a fuss about it.\\
190 - I hope they don't go overboard.
Yeah.\\
191 - POTTER: Oh, yes, they...
but they're all going all out.\\
192 - Oh, they,	Really?\\
193 - they're going all out.
How about that?\\
194 - Sure. They even wanted to know if
you'd put on a show.\\
195 - A show?!\\
196 - Sure.\\
197 - How about it, Ricky?\\
198 - Oh, that would be fun. Let's do it.\\
199 - All right.\\
200 - Ha, ha, ha!\\
201 - I already told them you would.\\
202 - (laughing)\\
203 - It's all set up for tomorrow night.\\
204 - Oh.\\
205 - Oh, you ought to see the marquee on
the little theater.\\
206 - You haven't any idea what it says.\\
207 - What does it say?\\
208 - "Ethel Mae Potter: We never forgot
her."\\
209 - "Ethel Mae Potter"?\\
210 - That's, uh...
that's all it says?\\
211 - Yeah. Why?\\
212 - Oh, nothing. It's just, you know,\\
213 - when you said, uh, "celebrity," you
know,\\
214 - I figured that maybe...\\
215 - Oh, well, Ethel Mae is very big here
in Albuquerque.\\
216 - She's big everywhere.\\
217 - Now, Daddy, you're exaggerating.\\
218 - Why, I haven't done anything to speak
of\\
219 - since I was in vaudeville.\\
220 - Oh, yeah? Well, how come you're on
your way to Hollywood\\
221 - to star in a movie?\\
222 - Uh...\\
223 - Star in a movie?\\
224 - Uh, Daddy, you misunderstood.\\
225 - Ricky's going to be in the picture.\\
226 - Oh, you're gonna be in it, too?\\
227 - Well, I wouldn't exactly put it that
way.\\
228 - Aw, now, don't you worry.\\
229 - If Ethel says that you're gonna be in
her picture,\\
230 - you're gonna be in her picture.\\
231 - That's nice.\\
232 - Oh, Daddy, you got it all wrong.\\
233 - Well, that's what you wrote.\\
234 - No, what I meant was, Ricky is the
star.\\
235 - I'm just a... oh, a...\\
236 - There's my daughter for you: modesty
personified.\\
237 - She hasn't changed a bit.\\
238 - No, sir, she always was a shrinking
violet.\\
239 - (coughs)\\
240 - Now, honey, never mind the false
modesty.\\
241 - Go ahead, tell us about your picture.\\
242 - Yeah, Ethel, tell us about your
picture.\\
243 - Yeah.\\
244 - Um...\\
245 - If Billy Hackett's coming over,\\
246 - I want to freshen up just a little.\\
247 - I'll fix my hair up a little...\\
248 - Uh... Oh, Ethel Mae, take your old
room.\\
249 - We haven't touched it since you left.\\
250 - It must be a nice dusty mess by now.\\
251 - Say, if you folks will just make
yourselves at home\\
252 - I'm going to run to the candy store\\
253 - and tell everybody how wonderful
Ethel Mae looks.\\
254 - Okay.\\
255 - (door closes)\\
256 - Hmm.\\
257 - Ethel Mae's picture.\\
258 - How do you like that?\\
259 - Oh, come now, what difference does it
make\\
260 - if her father thinks it's her
picture?\\
261 - Why, she didn't even try to deny it.\\
262 - Well, she didn't want to make her
father look bad.\\
263 - Why not? Everybody knows he's full of
baloney.\\
264 - Oh, come on now.
Promise me one thing.\\
265 - When the man from the newspaper gets
here\\
266 - to interview you, you make Ethel look
good.\\
267 - You tell him that she's gonna be in
the picture, too.\\
268 - Well...\\
269 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
270 - There he is.
Now, remember,\\
271 - mention Ethel as much as you can.\\
272 - All right.\\
273 - And, honey, when he takes your
picture,\\
274 - you insist that Ethel be in it, too.\\
275 - Okay, dear. Okay.\\
276 - Hello.\\
277 - Hello. I'm Billy Hackett of the
Chronicle.\\
278 - How do you do?
I'm Lucy Ricardo.\\
279 - How do you do?\\
280 - This is Ricky Ricardo and Fred Mertz.\\
281 - How do you do?\\
282 - How are you?\\
283 - Well, I've wanted to know you for a
long time.\\
284 - Thank you.\\
285 - Yes, sir, I've always wanted to shake
the hand of the man\\
286 - who married Ethel Mae.\\
287 - Well, you, uh... you got the wrong
fella.\\
288 - That's him over there.\\
289 - Oh, you're the winner!\\
290 - Yeah, I'm the winner.\\
291 - And you're Ricky Ricardo!\\
292 - That's right.\\
293 - Well, I've got a lot of questions I
want to ask you.\\
294 - Oh, certainly. Sit down.
Anything you want to know.\\
295 - All right. How long have you known
Ethel Mae?\\
296 - Well, now, let me see, um...\\
297 - ETHEL: Billy Hackett!\\
298 - Ethel Mae!\\
299 - Oh, I'm so glad to see you.\\
300 - Oh, this is wonderful.\\
301 - My daddy told me you were coming
over.\\
302 - Oh, it's been so long.\\
303 - Ethel Mae, you were never prettier.\\
304 - I can't argue with that.\\
305 - I'd like to get a few pictures.\\
306 - Oh, fine.\\
307 - Would you stand right over there?\\
308 - Right over there where, uh, Mr.
Ricardo is.\\
309 - Yes.\\
310 - Get a nice informal shot of you.\\
311 - Now, just relax there and let me have
a little...\\
312 - Mr. Ricardo, would you mind moving\\
313 - just a little bit to your right,
please?\\
314 - Sure.\\
315 - BILLY: Yeah. Thank you.\\
316 - Now, sm...\\
317 - I'm sorry, Mr. Ricardo, but you're
still in the picture.\\
318 - All right, now smile.\\
319 - Got it! 	Oh, good.\\
320 - Hey, how about getting that group of
us?\\
321 - I've always wanted a good picture of
all of us together.\\
322 - Oh, that's fine.
Right here.
Here?\\
323 - Everybody gather around Ethel Mae,
huh?\\
324 - You just stand where Billy tells you
to.\\
325 - Now, just get... Put your arms around
her.\\
326 - Get all close together, you know.\\
327 - You fix 'em.
Very informal.\\
328 - Right around me.\\
329 - Put your arms around Ethel Mae,
please.\\
330 - Right there.
Thank you very much.\\
331 - There we are.\\
332 - Now...\\
333 - (shutters clicking)\\
334 - BILLY: Got it!\\
335 - Oh, that ought to be a good one.\\
336 - Now, for the big story.\\
337 - Sit down, Ethel Mae.\\
338 - Local girl makes good.\\
339 - Ethel Mae Potter reaches stardom in
Hollywood.\\
340 - Now, I want to know the story, the
human story in back of this.\\
341 - How did you get there?
How did it happen?\\
342 - Uh, was it a tough road and was it
worth it?\\
343 - Now, those are the things that your
friends\\
344 - from Albuquerque are waiting to hear.\\
345 - Yeah, your friends from New York\\
346 - are waiting to hear it, too.\\
347 - Yeah.\\
348 - Well, tell me, Ethel Mae,\\
349 - and I'll put your story on the front
page tomorrow.\\
350 - Um...\\
351 - Go ahead, Ethel Mae, tell him your
story.\\
352 - FRED: Yeah.\\
353 - Well, uh...\\
354 - Oh...\\
355 - Um...\\
356 - "My Story," by Ethel Mae Potter.\\
357 - You people who remain here\\
358 - in this lovely, quiet, peaceful town
of Albuquerque\\
359 - leading your dreary, uneventful
lives,\\
360 - little do you know\\
361 - the heartache, the heartbreak, the
hard work, the frustration\\
362 - that I went through to get where I am
today.\\
363 - (coughing)\\
364 - When I was a small tot playing around
the yard\\
365 - of the Albuquerque Grammar School,\\
366 - little did I know that I was destined\\
367 - to become the star of three
continents.\\
368 - That's wonderful!\\
369 - And it gives me a great idea.\\
370 - I am gonna make a series of pictures
of you all over town.\\
371 - We'll take them in the, in the
schoolyard\\
372 - where you once played\\
373 - and one in back of the counter\\
374 - of your, of your father's
sweetshop...\\
375 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
376 - And then we'll top it off with a,
with a big close-up shot\\
377 - of the little theater marquee.\\
378 - Oh, that'll just be great!\\
379 - Well, come on, let's do it!\\
380 - Right now?\\
381 - Why, certainly.\\
382 - Oh, fine.\\
383 - (laughing)\\
384 - See you later, dears.\\
385 - Isn't she something?\\
386 - I think she's blown her top.\\
387 - What do you suppose got into her?\\
388 - I don't know, but somewhere along the
line,\\
389 - shrinking violet got sanforized.\\
390 - Why, she's raving mad.\\
391 - We'd better get out of this joint\\
392 - before she starts foaming at the
mouth and bites somebody.\\
393 - Yeah, we'll leave tomorrow night
right after the show.\\
394 - You mean we're still gonna do the
show?\\
395 - You're darn right we're gonna the
show.\\
396 - I'm not gonna leave this town\\
397 - with everybody thinking that I'm
Ethel Mae's chauffeur.\\
398 - Now, I tell you what we're gonna do\\
399 - What?\\
400 - I'll do an opening number, and then
you do something.\\
401 - Then I'll sing "Babalu," then you do
something.\\
402 - Then I'll sing "Grenada," then you
and Fred...\\
403 - (playing "Chopsticks")\\
404 - Hey, Liberace.\\
405 - Where is Ethel?\\
406 - I want to start rehearsing.\\
407 - Oh, she went out with the mayor to
cut the tape on a new road\\
408 - into the Indian Reservation.\\
409 - Ay-ay-ay.\\
410 - LUCY: Ricky!
Yeah, honey?\\
411 - Fred!
Yeah?\\
412 - Listen to this.
What?\\
413 - "Glamorous star visits here on way to
film capital."\\
414 - Well, what did you expect after
yesterday's interview?\\
415 - I'll bet she doesn't even mention us.\\
416 - Oh, yes, she does.\\
417 - "Ethel Mae Potter who has been called
to Hollywood to star\\
418 - "in a wide-screen color spectacle\\
419 - is motoring to the coast with
friends." That's us.\\
420 - How do you like that?\\
421 - Oh, that's nothing.\\
422 - Try this on for size.\\
423 - "This evening Miss Potter will appear
at the little theater\\
424 - in a solo recital of songs and
readings."\\
425 - Solo?!\\
426 - Boy, she's really flipped.\\
427 - Yeah, well, there's more.\\
428 - Remember the picture taken of all of
us,\\
429 - the one with our arms around Ethel?\\
430 - Yeah.\\
431 - Hello.\\
432 - We were cut out!\\
433 - Yeah. Either that, or Ethel's grown
five more hands.\\
434 - ETHEL: ...see you tonight at the
show!\\
435 - Oh, here comes our shrinking violet
now.\\
436 - Yeah, the little shrinker.\\
437 - How.\\
438 - (bass notes sounding)\\
439 - They made her an Indian chief.\\
440 - What's your name, Big Chief
Hog-It-All?\\
441 - What do you mean?\\
442 - "What do you mean?"\\
443 - We read the paper, dear.\\
444 - Wasn't that write-up a lulu?\\
445 - And what a lulu.\\
446 - Yeah. I especially liked the picture:\\
447 - "Ethel and her trained hands."\\
448 - Yeah, thanks a lot for mentioning my
name.\\
449 - Now, just a minute.\\
450 - I can't help what Billy Hackett put
in the paper.\\
451 - Freedom of the press, you know.\\
452 - Freedom of the press, yes,\\
453 - but there wasn't a word of truth in
it.\\
454 - I beg your pardon.\\
455 - There might have been a slight
exaggeration here and there.\\
456 - Oh, Ethel!\\
457 - Ethel, what's come over you?\\
458 - "Solo performance."\\
459 - Are you crazy or something?\\
460 - Now, I can explain.\\
461 - Everybody wanted me to do something
special--\\
462 - something that I became famous for.\\
463 - So, what with one thing and another,\\
464 - (ostentatiously): there just wasn't
room for all of you.\\
465 - (mimicking Ethel)\\
466 - You know, you might have insisted
that we be in the show.\\
467 - Yes, I might have...
but I didn't want to.\\
468 - That's it!\\
469 - All right, come on.\\
470 - We're leaving for California right
now.\\
471 - That suits me.
Now, just a minute!\\
472 - I can't leave now.\\
473 - Oh, that's right.\\
474 - You have a show to do, haven't you?\\
475 - Well, we'll see you on the coast.\\
476 - Yeah.
How do I get out there?\\
477 - Well, call your studio.\\
478 - Maybe they'll send a special train
for a big star like you.\\
479 - Oh, I think you're all horrid!\\
480 - Now, just a second, folks.\\
481 - I'm sorry if Ethel Mae is so popular,\\
482 - there's no room for you,\\
483 - but, gosh, there must be something\\
484 - we can figure out you can do.\\
485 - Yeah, maybe we could be ushers in the
theater.\\
486 - Maybe we can put on aprons\\
487 - and sell your candy in the lobby.\\
488 - Say...\\
489 - Oh, no.\\
490 - Come on, let's get out of here.\\
491 - Wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
492 - I think we should stay.\\
493 - What?!			What?!\\
494 - Well, now, after all, this is Ethel's
hometown,\\
495 - and we should help her make a good
impression.\\
496 - Now, just a minute.
What's the matter...\\
497 - We'll stay, Ethel, and when you're on
that stage tonight,\\
498 - remember, you've got us right behind
you.\\
499 - Well, now, that's very nice of you.\\
500 - Thanks, Lucy.\\
501 - Yeah, thanks.\\
502 - Ethel Mae, get up and change your
clothes.\\
503 - We've got to go over to the
sweetshop.\\
504 - I'm naming a sundae after her.\\
505 - Yeah, well...\\
506 - What's the matter with you?\\
507 - Have you lost your mind?\\
508 - What did you want to say that for?\\
509 - Now, fellas, I just got to thinking\\
510 - about our dear Ethel Mae.\\
511 - Now, You know, it's very hard\\
512 - to carry a whole show all by yourself\\
513 - even if you're as big a star as she
is.\\
514 - She really needs somebody to back her
up,\\
515 - and that's where we come in.\\
516 - We'll be right behind her, on the
stage.\\
517 - (applause)\\
518 - Ladies and gentlemen, my friends,\\
519 - you don't know what a thrill it is\\
520 - for me to be on this stage tonight--\\
521 - this stage where I got my start--\\
522 - and I want you all to know\\
523 - that no matter how famous I become,\\
524 - I will never forget you or
Albuquerque.\\
525 - (sniffling)\\
526 - But enough of the sentiment.\\
527 - On with the show.\\
528 - For my first number tonight, I have
chosen a number\\
529 - that all of you love to hear me sing.\\
530 - I had many requests for your favorite

616 - That's fine.
Now let me see.\\
617 - Here, give me the stool.\\
618 - See if that looks all right.\\

\subsection {Episode 17: Hollywood at Last!}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Oh, look at this.\\
3 - Isn't it beautiful?\\
4 - Oh, Lucy, I never saw anything like
this in my whole life.\\
5 - Oh!\\
6 - Oh, Ricky, the studio must think a
lot of you\\
7 - to get you a suite like this.\\
8 - Hey, not bad, huh, Fred?\\
9 - Yeah, this is some class.\\
10 - Did you see Van Johnson?\\
11 - Where?\\
12 - He got in the elevator just as we got
off.\\
13 - That wasn't Van Johnson.\\
14 - It was, too.\\
15 - It was not.\\
16 - Wasn't that Van Johnson that got in
the elevator?\\
17 - No, ma'am, that was the house
detective.\\
18 - Oh. Well, it looked just like him.\\
19 - Everybody looks like a movie star to
my wife.\\
20 - Your room is down the hall. Thank
you.\\
21 - You're welcome.\\
22 - Okay. We'll see you later.\\
23 - Oh, Ricky, this is so wonderful.\\
24 - I hope you like your place.\\
25 - I hope it's half as nice as this.\\
26 - Bye. See you in a little while.\\
27 - FRED: Bye.\\
28 - Oh, honey, I can't believe it!\\
29 - We're really here.\\
30 - And none of this would have happened\\
31 - if you hadn't been so talented,
darling.\\
32 - Oh, at least I know one movie star.\\
33 - I know you're you.\\
34 - (laughing)\\
35 - Hey, wait a minute.\\
36 - I'd better call the studio and tell
them we're here.\\
37 - Where's the phone?\\
38 - Here.\\
39 - Oh.\\
40 - Here you are, sir.\\
41 - Thank you.\\
42 - Hollywood's out there!\\
43 - (chuckling): Yeah.\\
44 - Operator, Hollywood 33449, please.\\
45 - Ricky, come here.\\
46 - Just a minute, honey.\\
47 - Mr. Sherman, please.\\
48 - Lucy, did the boy bring my little
overnight bag?\\
49 - Yeah, there it is.\\
50 - Come here and look, Ethel.\\
51 - (gasps)\\
52 - Mr. Sherman, please.
Ricky Ricardo calling.\\
53 - What's your room like?\\
54 - Oh, it's lovely, but it doesn't have
a view like this.\\
55 - Look. There's the Brown Derby.\\
56 - (gasping): It is.\\
57 - Yeah, and Grauman's Chinese Theatre's
right up there. See?\\
58 - Oh, my!\\
59 - Mr. Sherman, this is Ricky Ricardo.\\
60 - We just got in.\\
61 - Yeah. Oh, yes, we had a wonderful
trip.\\
62 - Thank you. Oh, by the way Ben
Benjamin told me\\
63 - to give you his regards.\\
64 - He's talking to the studio.\\
65 - Oh, well, that sounds fine.\\
66 - Yeah, I'd love to see what the studio
looks like.\\
67 - Uh, the Commissary at 12:00 for
lunch.\\
68 - All right. I'll see you there.\\
69 - Thank you. Good-bye.\\
70 - Well, let's go.\\
71 - Let's go where?\\
72 - That's his idea of a Hollywood
outfit.\\
73 - Fred, I thought I took that stuff\\
74 - out of the bag in New York.\\
75 - Well, I put them back in.\\
76 - I've seen pictures of how they dress
in Hollywood\\
77 - and I want to fit in.\\
78 - I don't want to be conspicuous.\\
79 - You go take that off.\\
80 - I am not walking down the street with
you\\
81 - in that flowered nightshirt.\\
82 - Now, Fred, you'd better go change\\
83 - because we're all going to the studio
for lunch.\\
84 - FRED: No kidding?\\
85 - Yeah. Ricky just talked to the
producer.\\
86 - Oh.\\
87 - Well, uh, uh, honey, uh,\\
88 - he-he didn't invite all of us.\\
89 - Oh, dear.\\
90 - Me and my big mouth.\\
91 - I'm sorry, Ethel and Fred.\\
92 - I thought you were gonna get to go,
too.\\
93 - Oh, darn it.\\
94 - Well, that's the way the ball
bounces.\\
95 - Well, uh, honey, you're not going
either.\\
96 - Why not?\\
97 - Well, because he just invited me.\\
98 - Oh, darn it.\\
99 - Well, that's the way the ball
bounces.\\
100 - Oh, shut up!\\
101 - Honey, this is business today.\\
102 - Oh, here we are in Hollywood\\
103 - and I don't get to do anything.\\
104 - What am I gonna do this afternoon?\\
105 - Well, for one thing, I need a clean
shirt.\\
106 - So, why don't you start unpacking?\\
107 - And after the fun of unpacking wears
off, what then?\\
108 - Well, I tell you what.\\
109 - You drop me by the studio, and then
you can have the car\\
110 - for the rest of the afternoon and do
whatever you like.\\
111 - All right?
I'll go get ready.\\
112 - Hey, that's a wonderful idea, huh?\\
113 - Well, I suppose we could just drive
up and down the streets\\
114 - and hunt movie stars.\\
115 - Why not?\\
116 - Although tracking them down one by
one\\
117 - takes so much time.\\
118 - I wonder if there's anyplace\\
119 - where they get together in a herd?\\
120 - Well, maybe at sundown,\\
121 - they all gather at the same watering
hole.\\
122 - That's it!\\
123 - That's where we'll go.\\
124 - ETHEL: Where?\\
125 - The watering hole.\\
126 - Fellow hunters, we're going to the
Brown Derby.\\
127 - (Ethel gasps)\\
128 - Thank you.
Gee.\\
129 - Ooh, it's just like I imagined it.\\
130 - Yes.\\
131 - Well, come on, let's sit down.\\
132 - I never really thought I'd be here.\\
133 - Me either.\\
134 - Come on, let's sit down, will you?\\
135 - All right.\\
136 - Oh, look.\\
137 - Eddie Cantor.\\
138 - (chuckling): Yeah.\\
139 - Oh, look at Jimmy Durante.\\
140 - Oh, for heaven's sake.\\
141 - They've used two frames for his
schnozzola.\\
142 - (laughing)\\
143 - There's Cary Grant.\\
144 - Where?\\
145 - Right there.\\
146 - It is.\\
147 - Oh, you finally saw one.
Congratulations.\\
148 - Thanks.\\
149 - I have a feeling we've run\\
150 - into a whole nest of them.\\
151 - Ethel, will you sit down and stop
gawking?\\
152 - You're acting like a tourist.\\
153 - Well, I am a tourist.\\
154 - Well, get hold of yourself.\\
155 - Oh... look at the salads!\\
156 - Look at the pastries!\\
157 - Look at the prices!\\
158 - Don't worry, Fred, it's my treat.\\
159 - Ricky gave me the money.\\
160 - Oh, that's different.\\
161 - Now I can look at this side of the
menu.\\
162 - WOMAN: Telephone for Gregory Peck.\\
163 - Gregory Peck-- where is he?\\
164 - I don't see him.\\
165 - Well, he must be here.\\
166 - He got a telephone call.\\
167 - There he is!\\
168 - There he is right in there.
See?\\
169 - Oh, isn't he handsome.\\
170 - Look. He's smiling.\\
171 - Awwww!\\
172 - Aah, sit down, will you?\\
173 - Oh, Fred, what's the harm?\\
174 - They're movie stars.\\
175 - They're used to being stared at.\\
176 - Well, I guess he's right.\\
177 - I guess if they come here to eat,\\
178 - they'd like to eat in peace.\\
179 - WOMAN: Telephone for Walter Pidgeon.\\
180 - Now, if you two johnny jump-ups don't
sit down,\\
181 - I'm gonna eat by myself.\\
182 - He isn't here.\\
183 - Why do you have to be such
rubbernecks?\\
184 - They're just people like you and me.\\
185 - Yeah. I guess we'd better eat, huh?\\
186 - Yeah. Might as well decide what we
want\\
187 - before the waiter gets here.\\
188 - Yeah.\\
189 - Oh, boy, I'm gonna have a piece of
that.\\
190 - WOMAN: Telephone for Ava Gardner.\\
191 - Where?\\
192 - Where's Ava?\\
193 - Fred.\\
194 - Fred, sit down.\\
195 - Remember? She's just people, like you
and me.\\
196 - Yeah. She might be people, but she's
not like you and me.\\
197 - All right now.\\
198 - Have you decided what you're going to
have?\\
199 - Oh. Well, it's so hard to decide.\\
200 - Everything is so tempting.\\
201 - Uh, what is this Derby tossed salad?\\
202 - Anybody knows that, Lucy.\\
203 - You just take some salad and toss it
in a derby.\\
204 - (laughing)\\
205 - It's a mixed green salad in an oil
dressing.\\
206 - Oh. Well, I'll have that, please.\\
207 - Yes, ma'am.
And then I'd like\\
208 - the spaghetti and meatballs.\\
209 - Oh, that sounds good.
I'll have that, too.\\
210 - Yeah, and lots of meat sauce, please.\\
211 - Yes, ma'am.\\
212 - I'd like the veal cutlet Marco Polo.\\
213 - Veal cutlet.
Very well.\\
214 - Have you been in pictures?\\
215 - No, ma'am.\\
216 - No?\\
217 - (sighs)\\
218 - Ethel.
Huh?\\
219 - That picture on the end down there--
is that a picture\\
220 - of Shelley Winters or Judy Holliday?\\
221 - The one on the end in the bottom.\\
222 - I can't see the signature.\\
223 - I think it's Shelley Winters.\\
224 - Well, it looks more like Judy
Holliday.\\
225 - Well, what's the difference?\\
226 - Ask that lady in the next booth.\\
227 - Maybe she can tell.\\
228 - Oh, for corn's sake.\\
229 - Miss.\\
230 - I'm sorry to bother you,\\
231 - but my friend and I can't see the
signature\\
232 - on that last picture.\\
233 - Is that Shelley Winters or Judy
Holliday?\\
234 - Neither. That's Eve Arden.\\
235 - Thanks. Eve Arden.\\
236 - Oh.\\
237 - Oh, what she must think of me.\\
238 - You touched her!\\
239 - Ethel, what's the matter?\\
240 - Who?\\
241 - William who?\\
242 - (whispering): William Holden,\\
243 - (regular voice): behind you.\\
244 - William Holden, behind me?\\
245 - Oh, he's dreamy.\\
246 - (gasping)\\
247 - Oh...\\
248 - William Holden.\\
249 - Move around, please.\\
250 - Oh. Looks mighty tasty.\\
251 - Mmm.\\
252 - Oh!\\
253 - FRED: I'm sorry.\\
254 - If she wasn't pushing me, I could...\\
255 - Are you ready to order yet Mr.
Holden?\\
256 - Yeah, Gus. I'd like to start off with
a...\\
257 - Uh, a Cobb salad.\\
258 - Yes, sir.\\
259 - And, um... a cup of coffee.\\
260 - Yes, sir.\\
261 - And, uh...\\
262 - I don't have another booth, Mr.
Holden.\\
263 - It's all right.\\
264 - You know, they say when they stop
looking,\\
265 - that's the time to worry.\\
266 - Yes, sir.\\
267 - If I get another booth, Mr. Holden...\\
268 - Don't worry about it.\\
269 - You know, I sometimes wonder how a
person\\
270 - like that would feel if, uh, the shoe
were on the other foot.\\
271 - Ha!\\
272 - Wait a minute, that's an idea.\\
273 - For once I'm gonna turn the tables.\\
274 - Let's get out of here.\\
275 - FRED: Well, I'm not through.\\
276 - I don't care.\\
277 - Waiter, check, please.\\
278 - I'm not gonna leave all this good
food.\\
279 - I can't help it.\\
280 - Put it in a sack and take it with
you.\\
281 - Thank you.\\
282 - Thank you.\\
283 - The script looks fine, John.\\
284 - Well, good, Bill.
I'm glad you like it.\\
285 - Oh, Mr. Holden,\\
286 - Wardrobe had to send your coat out to
be cleaned,\\
287 - but they sent this one up for you to
wear home.\\
288 - Oh, good.\\
289 - Thank you.\\
290 - How did you get covered with all that
pie?\\
291 - Were you on a television show?\\
292 - No.\\
293 - Oh, by the way, Ricky Ricardo's here.\\
294 - He wants to show you his Don Juan
costume.\\
295 - Oh, fine. Come on in, Ricky!\\
296 - Mr. Sherman, it doesn't seem to me\\
297 - that this is quite the way to...\\
298 - I don't think that this is going to
work...\\
299 - This isn't right, is it?\\
300 - Of course not, Ricky.\\
301 - Don Juan never wore armor like that.\\
302 - He was supposed to be a great lover,
wasn't he?\\
303 - That's right.\\
304 - Well, if I ever kissed a girl in this
thing,\\
305 - I'd cut her nose off.\\
306 - Don't worry about it, Ricky.\\
307 - I'll straighten it out with Wardrobe.\\
308 - Oh, uh, meet William Holden, Ricky.\\
309 - Oh?\\
310 - This is Ricky Ricardo, Bill.\\
311 - How are you, Ricky?
Oh.\\
312 - How do you do, Mr. Holden.\\
313 - Very glad to know...
Excuse my glove.\\
314 - Ricky's doing Don Juan for us.\\
315 - Oh? Say, I, uh, I think that's one of
my old suits.\\
316 - Yeah?\\
317 - Only I hope you have a lot better
luck with it.\\
318 - You see, uh, one day on location, it
rained,\\
319 - and on the way back, I rusted shut.\\
320 - No.\\
321 - And when they got back, they called
me and said,\\
322 - "Come down to wardrobe.
We're opening a canned ham."\\
323 - Canned ham-- that's pretty good.\\
324 - I'll fix it up, Ricky.
Don't worry about it.\\
325 - Listen, could I use your telephone a
minute?\\
326 - Yeah, help yourself.\\
327 - I'd like to call my wife\\
328 - and have her come over to pick me up.\\
329 - Sure.\\
330 - What number do you want to dial?\\
331 - Oh, uh, the Beverly Palms Hotel.\\
332 - I'll have...
Wait a minute, Ricky.\\
333 - I go right by there.\\
334 - I can drop you off.\\
335 - Oh, no, that'll be too much trouble.\\
336 - It's right on my way.\\
337 - Are you sure?\\
338 - Sure.\\
339 - Gee, thanks.\\
340 - Say, if you're not in a rush,\\
341 - could you stop by for a moment?\\
342 - Sure, I'd love to.\\
343 - My wife is just dying to meet you.\\
344 - Ah, here we are, Bill.\\
345 - Oh, very nice.\\
346 - Isn't it nice?\\
347 - The studio got it for me.\\
348 - Make yourself at home.
I'll go get Lucy.\\
349 - Okay, fine.\\
350 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
351 - Hi, dear.\\
352 - How was the studio?\\
353 - Oh, wonderful.\\
354 - How was the Brown Derby?\\
355 - Uh, uh, oh,\\
356 - it was just swarming with movie
stars.\\
357 - I bet I saw more stars than you did
at the studio.\\
358 - Well, maybe so, maybe so,\\
359 - but, uh, I bet you didn't bring one
home with you.\\
360 - What do you mean?\\
361 - Well, one of the biggest stars in the
whole picture business\\
362 - is sitting in our living room right
now.\\
363 - Who?\\
364 - William Holden.\\
365 - What's he doing here?\\
366 - I thought you'd be pleased.\\
367 - I met him at the studio, he drove me
home\\
368 - and he wants to meet you.\\
369 - Well, I don't want to meet him.\\
370 - Honey, what are you talking about?\\
371 - I-I just don't feel like meeting him
right now, that's all.\\
372 - What's the matter, you sick or
something?\\
373 - Yeah, that's it. I'm sick.\\
374 - (groaning)\\
375 - You got a headache?\\
376 - Yeah. Oh... I mean...\\
377 - Is it your head, or is it your
stomach?\\
378 - Well, it sort of jumps around.\\
379 - Now, uh... look, Lucy, what-what's
going on?\\
380 - Why-why don't you want to meet Bill
Holden?\\
381 - Well...\\
382 - I know you're not shy.\\
383 - Yeah, that's it.\\
384 - I-I just found out.\\
385 - I-I'm very shy about meeting movie
stars.\\
386 - You tell him to go away,\\
387 - and I'll see him in his next picture.\\
388 - Lucy, I don't know what's got into
you, but I know this:\\
389 - After Bill Holden was nice enough to
drive home\\
390 - and come all the way up here to meet
you,\\
391 - you're gonna go out there and meet
him.\\
392 - But I just can't.\\
393 - Why not?\\
394 - I just can't.\\
395 - Why not?!\\
396 - Well, he never did appeal to me very
much.\\
397 - He just doesn't send me.\\
398 - What are you talking about?\\
399 - All I heard all the way across
country\\
400 - was "Bill Holden, Bill Holden, Bill
Holden."\\
401 - Yeah, well, I'm fickle?\\
402 - Come on. You're gonna go out there
and meet him right now.\\
403 - No! No, Ricky, please!\\
404 - Come on.\\
405 - No, Ricky, please!	Come on.\\
406 - Well, listen, at least let me fix my
face first.\\
407 - All right, but hurry up.\\
408 - Finally, they called me\\
409 - and they told me to come out and make
the picture.\\
410 - Well, I certainly want to wish you
luck.\\
411 - Thank you, Bill.\\
412 - It's a wonderful studio to work for.\\
413 - Well, that's good to hear.\\
414 - You want some more coffee?\\
415 - Yeah, a little more\\
416 - and then I'm gonna have to run.\\
417 - I don't know what's keeping Lucy.\\
418 - Oh, here she is.\\
419 - Honey, I want you to meet\\
420 - William Holden.
Bill..\\
421 - My wife... Lucy.\\
422 - How do you do, Mr. Holden?\\
423 - How do you do?\\
424 - You'll have to excuse my appearance.\\
425 - I just washed my hair\\
426 - and I can't do a thing with it.\\
427 - Well, uh, uh, uh...
you want some coffee?\\
428 - Yes, please.\\
429 - It's very exciting meeting you, Mr.
Holden.\\
430 - You're my favorite movie actor.\\
431 - Well, thank you, Lucy.\\
432 - I've seen you so many times, I feel
that I know you.\\
433 - You know, I have a funny feeling I
know you, too.\\
434 - Oh? Oh.\\
435 - Haven't we met somewhere?\\
436 - Oh, no, no.\\
437 - That's impossible.\\
438 - Yeah, I guess it is,\\
439 - but, uh, there's something about you
that's so familiar.\\
440 - Oh?\\
441 - Especially around the eyes.\\
442 - Oh.\\
443 - Here's your coffee.\\
444 - Oh, thank you.\\
445 - Uh, uh, Bill, what-what's the...\\
446 - what's the last picture you made?\\
447 - Well, we just finished shooting The
Country Girl\\
448 - with Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly.\\
449 - Oh, gee, that sounds wonderful.\\
450 - Yeah.
I hope I get to see it.\\
451 - Well, I hope if you do see it,\\
452 - you enjoy it.\\
453 - Oh, well, I'm sure I will.\\
454 - Would you, uh, like to watch a shoot?\\
455 - What was that?\\
456 - I said, would you like to watch a
shoot sometime?\\
457 - Oh! Could I?\\
458 - Why, sure. Next time we have, you
know, something interesting\\
459 - going on, I'll, I'll make
arrangements and, uh...\\
460 - Anything wrong, Mrs. Ricardo?\\
461 - My nose itches.\\
462 - This California sun certainly makes
your skin soft.\\
463 - Um, Ricky, uh, do you know, uh, yet
who your costar will be?\\
464 - Uh, no, no, I don't know, no.\\
465 - They haven't decided that yet.\\
466 - All they told me was that there was
supposed to be\\
467 - five very beautiful women in the
picture.\\
468 - What do you think about that, Mrs...?\\
469 - Cigarette?\\
470 - Lucy...\\
471 - would you mind telling me what's
going on?\\
472 - Well, I guess I might as well tell
you.\\
473 - I went to the Brown Derby today...\\
474 - That's it.\\
475 - That's where I saw you.\\
476 - The Brown Derby.\\
477 - She was, um, sitting in the next
booth,\\
478 - and, uh, I asked the headwaiter who
the beautiful redhead was.\\
479 - You did?\\
480 - Yes. I, uh, I wanted to find out your
name\\
481 - and come over and tell you that you
should be in movies,\\
482 - but, uh, you left before I had a
chance.\\
483 - Oh!\\
484 - Oh, you're just wonderful!\\
485 - Lucy. Lucy, dear.\\
486 - Um... I don't know what's the matter
with her, Bill.\\
487 - I-I guess she's so excited.\\
488 - LUCY: Yeah.\\
489 - She's never been this close to a move
star before.\\
490 - Yes. You'll... you'll have to forgive
me, Mr. Holden.\\
491 - I, I... I kissed Bill Holden!\\

\subsection {Episode 18: Don Juan and the Starlets}
1 - ("I love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
3 - Oh, hello.\\
4 - Here are the extra towels you wanted,
Mrs. Ricardo.\\
5 - Thank you very much.\\
6 - Lucy?\\
7 - Yeah?\\
8 - Lucy!\\
9 - What?\\
10 - Come here.\\
11 - Guess who's down by the pool.\\
12 - Who?\\
13 - Robert Taylor.\\
14 - No kidding.\\
15 - Yes. Maybe we can see him\\
16 - from up here. Come over.\\
17 - Where is he?\\
18 - There he is!
Where?\\
19 - See that great big green-
and-white-striped umbrella?\\
20 - Yeah.\\
21 - Well, you see those feet sticking out\\
22 - from under that umbrella?
Yeah.\\
23 - Those are Robert Taylor's feet!\\
24 - Robert Taylor's feet!\\
25 - Yeah, and the rest of him's even
better.\\
26 - No kidding!\\
27 - Well, get your bathing suit\\
28 - and meet me down by the pool.\\
29 - Okay. Oh! Oh, I can't.\\
30 - Ricky just called and-and he's, uh,\\
31 - he's on his way here from the studio
with a photographer.\\
32 - We're going to take some pictures.\\
33 - "We"? Are you going to be in them?\\
34 - Well, I didn't get all the details.\\
35 - But what other reason would they have
for taking them here?\\
36 - It's probably one of those fan
magazine deals, you know,\\
37 - where they play up the domestic
angle:\\
38 - "Lucy and Ricky Ricardo At Home."\\
39 - Oh, that'll be wonderful.\\
40 - Yeah.\\
41 - Ethel.\\
42 - Oh, for goodness sake, now,\\
43 - you could have gone into the wading
pool\\
44 - until Mommy got there.\\
45 - I want you to rub this oil on me\\
46 - so I can get a suntan.\\
47 - Oh, Fred, you'll never get a suntan.\\
48 - Your skin's just like mine.\\
49 - It's too fair.\\
50 - Well, it says right here\\
51 - if I use it, I'll be a golden brown.\\
52 - You will-- a golden brown blister.\\
53 - Well, I'm going to give it a try.\\
54 - Now let's go.\\
55 - Okay.\\
56 - I want to get one more look at Robert
Taylor.\\
57 - He's gone.\\
58 - He has?\\
59 - Oh, darn it!\\
60 - Now, let's go.\\
61 - We're wasting that good sun.\\
62 - Oh, there's no hurry.\\
63 - Yes, there is.\\
64 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
65 - They're here already?\\
66 - Does Ricky Ricardo live here?\\
67 - Uh, yes.\\
68 - Yes, he does.\\
69 - Well, I'm Dolores Donlon.\\
70 - The studio told me to come over here\\
71 - to have some pictures taken with
Ricky.\\
72 - Oh. Well, won't you come in?\\
73 - Thank you.\\
74 - Uh, I'm Mrs. Ricardo\\
75 - and this is Mr. And Mrs. Mertz.\\
76 - How do you do?\\
77 - How do you do?\\
78 - Oh, well, come on.\\
79 - We're wasting that good sun.\\
80 - There's no hurry.\\
81 - Oh, won't you sit down?\\
82 - Thank you.\\
83 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
84 - Hello.\\
85 - Hello.\\
86 - Is this the Ricardo apartment?\\
87 - Yes.\\
88 - Well, the studio said\\
89 - to come up and have some pictures
taken.\\
90 - Oh, hi, Dolores.\\
91 - Hi, Maggie.\\
92 - Did they call you for this, too?\\
93 - Yeah, but I don't know much about it.\\
94 - Me either.\\
95 - The studio just said to go over\\
96 - and have my picture taken with Ricky
Ricardo,\\
97 - whoever he is.\\
98 - Oh, haven't you met him?\\
99 - He's a handsome Latin with an accent.\\
100 - He's the end.\\
101 - Really?\\
102 - The living end.\\
103 - Uh... pardon me.\\
104 - I'm a little confused.\\
105 - What kind of pictures are they
taking?\\
106 - Oh, are you from the studio, too,
honey?\\
107 - No, I'm Mrs. End.\\
108 - I-I, I mean, I'm Mrs. Ricardo.\\
109 - Oh. Well, how do you do?\\
110 - I'm Maggie Magennis.\\
111 - Oh, well, how do you do?\\
112 - This is Mr. And Mrs. Mertz.\\
113 - Hello!\\
114 - How do you do? It's been nice knowing
you.\\
115 - We're going down to the pool.\\
116 - What for?\\
117 - I thought you said you wanted to get
some sun.\\
118 - With my fair skin?\\
119 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
120 - Oh, this is Ricky, I hope.\\
121 - Hello...\\
122 - Yeah, yeah, come on in.\\
123 - Hi, Dolores and Maggie!\\
124 - How are you?\\
125 - Good to see you.\\
126 - Why are there so many of them?\\
127 - Who cares?\\
128 - Come on.\\
129 - We're going down to the pool.	    
Wait!\\
130 - Wait!
We'll see you later, Lucy.\\
131 - Come in, Ross.\\
132 - Oh, hi.
Hi, honey.\\
133 - Ross Elliott, this is my wife Lucy.\\
134 - How do you do?\\
135 - Glad to meet you, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
136 - Thank you.\\
137 - Oh, hello, girls.\\
138 - WOMEN: Hi, Ross. How are you?\\
139 - What are those?\\
140 - Oh, well, they're going to be in the
Don Juan picture with me.\\
141 - Oh?\\
142 - Yeah, they play the four women\\
143 - that are in love with me in the
picture.\\
144 - Oh, that's very exciting.\\
145 - ROSS: Ricky, come on over and meet
the girls.\\
146 - Okay. Excuse me, honey.\\
147 - Girls, this is Ricky Ricardo.\\
148 - Hello, Dolores.
I met you before.\\
149 - Hello, girls. Hi.\\
150 - Okay, kids, let's get started.\\
151 - Now, Ricky, for the first shot, take
this script\\
152 - and sit in that chair with the girls
all around you, huh?\\
153 - Okay.\\
154 - Now, we'll see how that looks.\\
155 - Okay.\\
156 - Okay, kids.\\
157 - That's good.
Now, one...\\
158 - Mrs. Ricardo, if you stand there,\\
159 - you're gonna be in the picture.\\
160 - Oh.\\
161 - It's not that we wouldn't like to use
you in some of the shots,\\
162 - but it just wouldn't fit in with our
publicity campaign.\\
163 - Oh, well, I-I thought you, uh, would
want\\
164 - to play up the domestic angle.\\
165 - You know, how happily married Ricky
is.\\
166 - Well, we-we would ordinarily, you
see,\\
167 - but Don Juan is all about love.\\
168 - It's got nothing to do with marriage.\\
169 - Oh.\\
170 - Okay, kids, let's get this now.\\
171 - Ready? One, two and...\\
172 - Good.\\
173 - Okay, now I think we'll have some
cheesecake.\\
174 - Everybody, over to the couch.\\
175 - Ricky, you go get your guitar, huh?\\
176 - Okay.\\
177 - ROSS: All right, kids.\\
178 - Two on one side and two on the other.\\
179 - Yeah, that's gonna be fine.\\
180 - Now let's all cross our legs to the
right, huh?\\
181 - That's good. Now leave space a little
for Ricky.\\
182 - RICKY: Where do you want me, Ross?\\
183 - Right in the middle, Ricky,
serenading the girls, huh?\\
184 - Everybody look at Ricky and smile.\\
185 - Now hold it.\\
186 - One... two...\\
187 - Mrs. Ricardo...\\
188 - Well, you said everybody.\\
189 - Well, I meant all the girls.\\
190 - Oh.\\
191 - Lucy...\\
192 - well, I misunderstood him.
That's all.\\
193 - Okay, all right.\\
194 - One, two and... good.\\
195 - Now, for the next shot, let's have
everybody\\
196 - back of the couch, huh?\\
197 - Uh, well, if you don't need me, I
have a few things\\
198 - I could be doing in the bedroom.\\
199 - All right, Mrs. Ricardo, if we need
you, we'll call you.\\
200 - Thank you.\\
201 - All right now, Ricky,\\
202 - you stretch out on the couch, looking
up at the girls.\\
203 - Girls, I want just the heads showing.\\
204 - Okay.
Everybody down.\\
205 - That's right.\\
206 - Now, just the chin sticking up.\\
207 - Just your chin.
Now, there.\\
208 - Now, let's see how that's going to
look.\\
209 - Now, don't move, Beverly.\\
210 - Now, I want you two to move over to
the right\\
211 - and you three to...\\
212 - Three?!\\
213 - Mrs. Ricardo.\\
214 - Lucy, what are you doing back there?\\
215 - I lost my earring.\\
216 - Where?\\
217 - In the bedroom.\\
218 - What are you doing looking out here
for it?\\
219 - Because the light's better out here.\\
220 - ROSS: Okay, kids, let's get this
shot, huh?\\
221 - One, two...\\
222 - Good. Okay, now I think we'll move
down to the pool.\\
223 - Kids, change into your suits in the
cabana.\\
224 - Ricky, get into some trunks and a
robe, huh?\\
225 - Okay.\\
226 - All right, fine.\\
227 - Oh, it's nice to have met you, Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
228 - I'll see you again sometime.\\
229 - ETHEL: Lucy?\\
230 - Yeah.\\
231 - Are you watching that spectacle from
up here?\\
232 - Isn't it revolting?\\
233 - Will you please tell me\\
234 - what is so exciting about taking
pictures\\
235 - of four starlets in bikini bathing
suits?\\
236 - I don't know,\\
237 - but I could see Fred's eyes bugged
out clear up here.\\
238 - Phew!\\
239 - Boy, I'm glad that's over.\\
240 - I never realized that taking pictures
was such hard work.\\
241 - Oh, you poor little thing.\\
242 - I'll bet your arms are all calloused\\
243 - from having them around those
starlets.\\
244 - Honey, you know I had nothing to do
with this.\\
245 - Don't get mad.\\
246 - Mad? Me mad?\\
247 - (chuckling): Why? Why should I be
mad?\\
248 - On the contrary,\\
249 - I'm glad, very glad.\\
250 - Why, when those girls walked in here
today,\\
251 - it was the happiest day of my life.\\
252 - Now, Lucy...\\
253 - And when they didn't want me\\
254 - in the pictures, I wanted to jump for
joy.\\
255 - Lucy...\\
256 - And my goodness!\\
257 - When you all put on those bathing
suits\\
258 - and trooped down to the pool,\\
259 - I just felt as if my fondest dreams
had come true.\\
260 - Now, honey...\\
261 - And you thought I was mad.\\
262 - Why, I wasn't mad.\\
263 - I was happy. Happy!\\
264 - H-a-p-p-y, happy!\\
265 - Boy.\\
266 - Now, look, honey, I-I know that
you're a little upset, but...\\
267 - A little upset.\\
268 - You think I'm a little upset.\\
269 - Now, just a minute.\\
270 - Ricky, let her go.\\
271 - I want to see what she'll do for an
encore.\\
272 - Now, look, honey, I-I know\\
273 - that this is hard for you to put up
with,\\
274 - but, uh, it's part of the publicity
campaign\\
275 - for the picture, and I got to go
along with it.\\
276 - Yeah, well, I don't got to go along
with it.\\
277 - Yes, you do.\\
278 - You are my wife, and this is part of
my career right now.\\
279 - Now, there'll probably be a lot more
pictures like that,\\
280 - but I'm sure that if you think the
whole thing over calmly,\\
281 - you won't be childish enough to let
it bother you.\\
282 - Any bets?\\
283 - You keep out of this.\\
284 - Here. Here's something to make you
happy.\\
285 - Ross gave me some tickets to go to a
big premiere tonight,\\
286 - and we're going to get all dressed up
and go.\\
287 - We are?\\
288 - Yes, sir.\\
289 - I'm taking the prettiest girl in
Hollywood to the premiere.\\
290 - Aw... honey.\\
291 - Oh, I love movies with a happy
ending.\\
292 - Gee, Ethel, just think:\\
293 - My first Hollywood premiere.\\
294 - Where is it, honey?\\
295 - Grauman's Chinese Theatre?\\
296 - He didn't tell me.
Look on the tickets and see.\\
297 - Just one ticket here.\\
298 - You sure?\\
299 - I'm positive.\\
300 - Oh, well, then it must be good for
two people--\\
301 - you know, one person and a guest.\\
302 - Of course, dear.\\
303 - That's why it says, "Admit one."\\
304 - Oh.\\
305 - Well, I almost got to a Hollywood
premiere.\\
306 - Now, honey, there's just been a
mistake, that's all.\\
307 - You bet there's just been a mistake,\\
308 - and I made it 15 years ago when
Marion Strong asked me\\
309 - to go on a blind date with a Cuban
drummer and I said yes.\\
310 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
311 - Oh, hello, Ross. Come in.\\
312 - Say, Ricky, I just realized\\
313 - I only gave you one ticket for
tonight.\\
314 - See?\\
315 - Oh. Well...\\
316 - I can't send you to a premiere all by
yourself.\\
317 - No, that's right.\\
318 - You certainly can't.\\
319 - Here you are.\\
320 - One, two, three, four.\\
321 - Four?\\
322 - Four?\\
323 - Yeah, for the four girls.\\
324 - Now, look, Ricky, when they interview
you in the lobby,\\
325 - mention Don Juan as many times as you
can...\\
326 - Now, now, look, Ross, Ross,\\
327 - I wanted to take Lucy to the premiere
tonight.\\
328 - Now, Ricky, I know how you feel,\\
329 - but I've got this thing all set up.\\
330 - There'll be plenty of other premieres\\
331 - she can go to later on.\\
332 - You understand, don't you, Mrs.
Ricardo?\\
333 - Oh, sure, I understand.\\
334 - Oh, you're a real doll.\\
335 - Now, look, Ricky, there's a party at
the Mocambo\\
336 - after the show-- you and the four
girls, okay?\\
337 - Yeah.\\
338 - I'll see you at the studio in the
morning, huh?\\
339 - Yeah, well, yeah...\\
340 - I know.\\
341 - I'm your wife, and I have to go along
with it.\\
342 - It's part of your career.\\
343 - It's for publicity\\
344 - and I'm not supposed to let it bother
me.\\
345 - I shouldn't be childish\\
346 - and I should take it with a smile.\\
347 - Lucy...\\
348 - I'm smiling.\\
349 - I don't like you when you're smiling
that way.\\
350 - Don't press your luck.
I'm smiling.\\
351 - Oh, honey, you shouldn't have waited
up for me.\\
352 - Come on. Let's go to bed.\\
353 - Come on, honey.\\
354 - I got an early call at the studio
tomorrow.\\
355 - (mumbling)\\
356 - Lucy, have I got a clean tux shirt?\\
357 - Honey, I got to go to the studio in
my tux, and I want...\\
358 - Aah...\\
359 - Ten o'clock!\\
360 - Give me MGM Studio, please.\\
361 - (slamming down phone)\\
362 - Hello. Is Ricky Ricardo working there
today?\\
363 - Well, would you find him, please?\\
364 - I-I'll hold on.\\
365 - Oh, you're up. Good.\\
366 - Say, Ethel wants to know if we're
still going\\
367 - to Knott's Berry Farm today.\\
368 - The only knots you'll see today\\
369 - will be on Ricky's head!\\
370 - Huh?\\
371 - He didn't come home all night!\\
372 - Oh, you must be mistaken.\\
373 - Go see for yourself.\\
374 - His bed hasn't been slept in.\\
375 - Oh.\\
376 - Well, of course it hasn't.\\
377 - What do you mean?\\
378 - Well, that's another reason I had for
coming over.\\
379 - First I wanted to ask you\\
380 - about going to Knott's Berry Farm\\
381 - and then I wanted to tell you that\\
382 - Ricky spent the night over at our
place.\\
383 - He did?\\
384 - Yeah.\\
385 - Why?\\
386 - Why?\\
387 - Well, he... Why?\\
388 - Hello?\\
389 - Yes?\\
390 - Oh. Oh, well, thank you.\\
391 - He's on his way home from the studio.\\
392 - Yeah, that's it. He got an early call
from the studio,\\
393 - and he didn't want to disturb you.\\
394 - Really?\\
395 - Yeah. Well, I'll see you later.\\
396 - I just thought of something I have to
tell Ethel.\\
397 - Hi.\\
398 - Come on, Ethel. Let's go and eat
breakfast.\\
399 - We just had breakfast.\\
400 - Well, let's go and have another one.
I'm starving.\\
401 - What's the matter with you?\\
402 - Ethel, Ethel, did anyone sleep on
your couch last night?\\
403 - Yeah. Why?\\
404 - Are you sure?\\
405 - Sure, I'm sure.\\
406 - Well, I'll be darned.\\
407 - How did you know I slept on the couch
last night?\\
408 - Aha!\\
409 - "Aha" what?\\
410 - I sleep on the couch lots of nights.\\
411 - Fred snores like a buzz saw.\\
412 - Well, at least you know where your
buzz saw was last night.\\
413 - What are you talking about?\\
414 - Ricky didn't come home at all.\\
415 - He didn't!\\
416 - Oh, now, let's not jump to
conclusions.\\
417 - There must be some logical...\\
418 - Oh, you keep out of this, you, you
husband, you!\\
419 - Well, I'm lost.\\
420 - What are you talking about?\\
421 - Oh, Fred's trying to cover up for
Ricky\\
422 - by telling me that he slept on your
couch last night.\\
423 - Oh, honestly, Fred.\\
424 - Well, I just thought that there might
be a...\\
425 - Hi, everybody.
Hi, honey.\\
426 - Oh!\\
427 - Have you no shame?\\
428 - Huh?\\
429 - Look at him, out all night,\\
430 - parading around at 10:00 in the
morning in his tuxedo!\\
431 - What happened?\\
432 - You'll never get out of this one.\\
433 - Just turn around and head back for
Cuba.\\
434 - I'd like to know what's going on.\\
435 - So would I.\\
436 - Where were you last night?\\
437 - Yes. Where were you last night, you
cad?\\
438 - Yeah. I'd kind of like to know
myself.\\
439 - What's the matter with all of you?\\
440 - You know where I was last night.\\
441 - I went to the premiere\\
442 - and then I want to the party at
Mocambo's.\\
443 - And then?\\
444 - And then?\\
445 - And then I came home.\\
446 - Ha!\\
447 - Now look, I-I-I...
You mind telling me\\
448 - what-what you're talking about?\\
449 - I was right on that couch all night\\
450 - and you did not come home.\\
451 - You crazy or something?
Of course I came home.\\
452 - I'll tell you exactly what happened.\\
453 - I came home. It was 2:30 in the
morning.\\
454 - You were asleep on the couch.\\
455 - I tried to woke you, wake you up, but
you wouldn't budge.\\
456 - So, I-I figured I'd better let you
sleep there, it was late.\\
457 - So I covered you up, I gave you a
kiss.\\
458 - I went in the bedroom, I went to
sleep.\\
459 - I had an early call this morning and
I got up.\\
460 - I-I-I... You were still asleep, so I
went to work\\
461 - and I finished my work, I came home.\\
462 - That's all there is to it.\\
463 - Oh, come now.\\
464 - You can do better than that.\\
465 - She's right.\\
466 - You can do better than that.\\
467 - I suppose you always wear your tuxedo\\
468 - in the studio in the morning?\\
469 - Well, th-they wanted me to wear the
tuxedo.\\
470 - They-they were taking some pictures\\
471 - supposed to be in a nightclub.\\
472 - Oh, glib, isn't he?\\
473 - Check with Ross Elliott.\\
474 - All right, I will.\\
475 - Oh, oh, wait a minute.\\
476 - He dropped me here on the way to the
airport.\\
477 - He's on his way to San Francisco
right now.\\
478 - How very convenient.\\
479 - Now, wait a minute.\\
480 - Now, th-th-th-this, this is
ridiculous.\\
481 - I'm telling you, I was home last
night!\\
482 - All right. All right.\\
483 - If you had to put your tuxedo on
again this morning,\\
484 - that means that I'll find the shirt
you wore last night\\
485 - in the clothes hamper, right?\\
486 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
487 - Wait a minute.\\
488 - I had to wear the same shirt.\\
489 - All the other tuxedo shirts were in
the laundry.\\
490 - Oh, now, isn't that too bad?\\
491 - Now, look. This is ridiculous now.\\
492 - I'm telling you all that I was home
last night.\\
493 - And you slept in your bed.\\
494 - Yes.\\
495 - Then your bed would be unmade.\\
496 - Yes.\\
497 - Did you made that bed?\\
498 - No, I did not "made" that bed.\\
499 - Has the maid been here?\\
500 - No, the maid has not been here.\\
501 - See? Wastepaper basket's full\\
502 - ashtrays haven't been emptied.\\
503 - Go ahead.
It's your turn.\\
504 - Wait, wait, wait.\\
505 - I'm waiting.\\
506 - There's something.\\
507 - There's got to be something.\\
508 - I know. I got it!\\
509 - My carnation-- I threw it in the
wastebasket in the bedroom. Ha!\\
510 - I know I put it in here!\\
511 - What happened to it?\\
512 - The phantom maid strikes again.\\
513 - Oh, now. Come on, now.\\
514 - Look, I'm telling you,\\
515 - I'm telling you that I came home last
night.\\
516 - I came home, it was 2:30 in the
morning.\\
517 - You were asleep in the couch. I
could...\\
518 - That's it.\\
519 - You were asleep in the couch, right?\\
520 - Yes.\\
521 - All right. If I wasn't home,\\
522 - how do I know that you were asleep on
the couch?\\
523 - Yeah.\\
524 - Because I just told you.\\
525 - I told you when you came in\\
526 - that I was asleep on that couch all
night.\\
527 - Yeah.\\
528 - Oh.\\
529 - Nice try, though.\\
530 - Oh, I beg your pardon.\\
531 - I thought I could finish up in here.\\
532 - I mean, I thought I could do the
room.\\
533 - Now, look, honey.\\
534 - You got to listen to me.\\
535 - I... Finish up in here?\\
536 - Maid!\\
537 - Maid?\\
538 - Maid! Maid, please come here!\\
539 - Come here, please.\\
540 - Come here, please.\\
541 - Come right in here.\\
542 - Now, look, you just said you wanted
to finish up in here.\\
543 - Were you here before?\\
544 - Oh, no. No, I wasn't in here, sir.\\
545 - It's against the rules for the maid\\
546 - to enter the room when the guest is
in.\\
547 - Oh, and please don't tell the manager
I did!\\
548 - Oh!\\
549 - You're wonderful.\\
550 - I love you dearly.\\
551 - Oh, oh, gee, I wish all the guests
were as nice as this.\\
552 - Well, I wish all the maids were as
nice as you are.\\
553 - You're a very nice lady, and I'm
gonna give you\\
554 - the biggest box of candy you ever
got. I love you.\\
555 - (blowing kiss)\\
556 - Ricky,\\
557 - I'm sorry I thought what I thought.\\
558 - Can you forgive me?\\
559 - Listen, for a minute, I was beginning
to wonder\\
560 - whether I was home last night.\\
561 - (guffawing)\\
562 - Let's go, Ethel.\\
563 - The lovebirds are at it again.\\
564 - (Lucy laughing)\\
565 - Oh, look. Here's a program from the
premiere last night.\\
566 - Yeah.\\
567 - Yeah, I brought it home last night\\
568 - so Lucy could see...\\
569 - How about that?\\
570 - What?\\
571 - My alibi.\\
572 - Oh, no! Was it here all the time?\\
573 - All night long.\\
574 - (all laughing)\\
575 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
576 - ANNOUNCER: The publicity man was Ross
Elliott,\\

\subsection {Episode 19: Lucy Gets in Pictures}
1 - ("I love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Honey, I'm going downstairs to get
the New York papers.\\
3 - Can I get you anything?\\
4 - Oh, will you mail my postcards for
me?\\
5 - Are you still writing postcards?\\
6 - You must have written a hundred of
those since we got out here.\\
7 - Well, I want to share our trip with
everybody.\\
8 - We're having so much fun, I want our
friends in New York\\
9 - to have sort of a secondhand thrill.\\
10 - Well, that's nice, dear.\\
11 - Uh, honey?\\
12 - Yeah?\\
13 - Do you feel all right?\\
14 - Sure. Why?\\
15 - Come here. Let me look at you.\\
16 - I'm afraid maybe you're getting a
cold.\\
17 - Stick out your tongue.\\
18 - What's the big idea?\\
19 - Well, I've stamped so many cards, I'm
all out of lick.\\
20 - Here you are.\\
21 - Okay.\\
22 - Now, remember, don't read them.\\
23 - Why not?\\
24 - Because it's not nice\\
25 - to read other people's postcards.\\
26 - Well, you and Ethel do it at home all
the time.\\
27 - Not until after they're mailed.\\
28 - It's illegal to read them before
they're postmarked.\\
29 - Oh, I see.\\
30 - All right, I won't read them.\\
31 - Okay.\\
32 - The rules you two have.\\
33 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.\\
34 - Lucy.
What?\\
35 - What do you mean by writing this to
Lillian Appleby?\\
36 - You read them.\\
37 - Yes, and it's a good thing I did.\\
38 - What do you mean telling Lillian
Appleby\\
39 - that you're going to be in a movie?\\
40 - I can't get over it.\\
41 - You stood right here and said you
wouldn't read them.\\
42 - Honestly, you just don't know who you
can trust anymore.\\
43 - For heaven's sake, a man who will
read a postcard\\
44 - after he said he won't will do
anything.\\
45 - Never mind all that.\\
46 - I want to know all about this movie\\
47 - you're gonna be in.\\
48 - I refuse to discuss anything with a
sneak.\\
49 - A snick?\\
50 - All right, a snick.\\
51 - Why did you told Lillian Appleby\\
52 - that you were going to be in a movie?\\
53 - Because I had to told her.\\
54 - Or she'd be mad if I told Marian
Strong first.\\
55 - Did you tell all these people\\
56 - that you were going to be in a movie?\\
57 - No. I didn't mention it to little
Ricky.\\
58 - Ay-ay-ay.\\
59 - I don't understand it.\\
60 - I don't see how you can say something
that is not true.\\
61 - How do you know it isn't true?\\
62 - It's true until it's untrue.\\
63 - After all, Hollywood's looking for
new faces.\\
64 - Well, your face is not new.\\
65 - It is to them.\\
66 - They've never seen it before.\\
67 - Well, it finally happened.\\
68 - Ever since we've been out in
Hollywood,\\
69 - I've been waiting for you to try to
get into the movies.\\
70 - What took you so long?\\
71 - I was lulling you into a false sense
of security.\\
72 - Yeah. Well, now that you brought the
subject up,\\
73 - let me tell you something.\\
74 - Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.\\
75 - Is this gonna be the one about how
I'm a wife and mother\\
76 - and my place is in the home?	   
No.\\
77 - Is it about one member of the family\\
78 - in show business being enough?\\
79 - No.\\
80 - Oh, well, don't tell me\\
81 - you're gonna use that ridiculous one\\
82 - about my not having any talent.\\
83 - No.\\
84 - Oh, you have a new one?
Well, go ahead.\\
85 - Here you are.\\
86 - Here you are in pretty, sunny
California.\\
87 - Hundreds of people all over the world\\
88 - would give their right arm\\
89 - just for the opportunity to visit
here.\\
90 - And what do you want to do?\\
91 - You want to go to a studio and work
from morning till night\\
92 - six days a week.\\
93 - Well, I...\\
94 - It's a beautiful climate.\\
95 - There's hundreds of things to do.\\
96 - Hundreds of places to go.\\
97 - You got your best pals, the Mertzes,
here with you\\
98 - to go wherever you want to go.\\
99 - You got a brand-new, beautiful
Pontiac to take you there.\\
100 - This could be one of the most
wonderful and exciting\\
101 - experiences of your whole life.\\
102 - Well, gee, I...\\
103 - But what do you want to do?\\
104 - You want to go to work.\\
105 - I wished you'd used the one about my
not having any talent.\\
106 - This one's tough to fight.\\
107 - Why, sure, honey.\\
108 - Why don't you forget all about being
in the movies\\
109 - and have fun, enjoy yourself?\\
110 - Well... Ethel and I did want to go to
Catalina next week.\\
111 - Sure!\\
112 - And maybe Pismo Beach.\\
113 - Yes?\\
114 - And then there's always Palm Springs.\\
115 - Palm springs! Even the president
vacations there.\\
116 - That's true.
(knock at door)\\
117 - RICKY: Hi. Come in.\\
118 - Hi.
Hi.\\
119 - LUCY: Hey. Are we gonna have fun?\\
120 - I was just planning some big trips
for us.\\
121 - I'm afraid they'll have to wait a
while.\\
122 - Yeah.
Why?\\
123 - Tell them, Ethel.\\
124 - Well, we were just down in the coffee
shop\\
125 - and we ran into a fella\\
126 - who used to be in vaudeville with us,
Jimmy O'Connor.\\
127 - And he's a producer at your studio
now, Ricky,\\
128 - and guess what.\\
129 - What?\\
130 - He gave us parts\\
131 - in his new picture.\\
132 - FRED: And we start tomorrow.\\
133 - Isn't that exciting?!\\
134 - That's great!\\
135 - Whee.\\
136 - What's the matter with you?\\
137 - I thought you'd be happy for us.\\
138 - I am.\\
139 - Well, you don't sound happy.\\
140 - Now, look, honey, this won't change
anything.\\
141 - The Mertzes would probably\\
142 - only be in the picture a day or two.\\
143 - Oh, no. It's for two whole weeks.\\
144 - Yeah.\\
145 - Congratulations.\\
146 - ETHEL: What's the matter with her?\\
147 - Well, just before you came in,\\
148 - I talked her out of wanting to get
into the movies\\
149 - and convinced her that she could have
a lot more fun\\
150 - just taking trips with you two.\\
151 - Oh, dear.\\
152 - Oh, now, don't you worry.\\
153 - Lucy, we'll take lots of trips
together.\\
154 - Just as soon as we wrap up\\
155 - our picture commitments.\\
156 - Oh, sure. We'll still want to see
those places.\\
157 - Well, we got to go over\\
158 - to wardrobe and get fitted for our
costumes.\\
159 - Hey, listen, I got to go over to the
studio, too.\\
160 - I'll drop you off.\\
161 - Oh, fine.
Fine.\\
162 - Aw, honey, don't be blue.\\
163 - Come on.\\
164 - See you later, huh?\\
165 - Well, see you later.\\
166 - So long, Lucy.\\
167 - Bye, dear.\\
168 - ETHEL: Imagine us in the movies.\\
169 - Yeah.\\
170 - (knock at door)\\
171 - Come in.\\
172 - Hi, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
173 - Oh, hello, Bobby.\\
174 - I brought up your cleaning.\\
175 - Would you hang it\\
176 - in the bedroom for me, please?\\
177 - Yes, ma'am.\\
178 - Enjoying your stay in Hollywood?\\
179 - Yech.\\
180 - Hey, you, uh, you got the red eight
on the red nine.\\
181 - Yeah. I thought it might spice up the
game\\
182 - if I cheated a little.\\
183 - Uh, Mrs. Ricardo,\\
184 - you won't be seeing me for a few
days.\\
185 - Oh, you going on a trip?\\
186 - No, I got a part in a picture.\\
187 - You have?\\
188 - Yeah.\\
189 - Remember last time I was only a
stooge?\\
190 - Uh-huh.\\
191 - This time I got a line to read.\\
192 - A whole line!\\
193 - Yeah. Oh, it's a very dramatic scene.\\
194 - See, I play a hospital orderly.\\
195 - Now, this woman comes rushing in.\\
196 - Her hair is messed up 'cause she's
very upset\\
197 - 'cause her husband's been in an
accident.\\
198 - Now, she sees me and she says, "What
room is my husband in?"\\
199 - Then I say, "423."\\
200 - (sobbing)\\
201 - Sort of gets you right here, doesn't
it?\\
202 - 423.\\
203 - (sobbing louder)\\
204 - Boy, I got more talent than I
thought.\\
205 - No, you don't understand, Bobby.\\
206 - You see, my husband is starring in a
picture,\\
207 - and today my best friends, the
Mertzes, told me\\
208 - that they got parts in a picture\\
209 - and now you tell me you got a part.\\
210 - I just feel left out.\\
211 - I feel like an ugly duckling.\\
212 - Well, that's ridiculous!
You're prettier than any of us.\\
213 - And talented, too!\\
214 - Oh, can-can you act?\\
215 - Can I act?\\
216 - Can I act?!\\
217 - What room is my husband in?\\
218 - 423.\\
219 - Thank you!\\
220 - See?\\
221 - Hey, you're great.\\
222 - Yeah, well, thanks a lot.\\
223 - I'm afraid my light's always gonna be
hidden under a bushel.\\
224 - What about your husband?\\
225 - Can he help you get in pictures?\\
226 - You mean, Ricky Ricardo, the Cuban
bushel?\\
227 - Well, you'll just have to go out\\
228 - and let somebody else discover you.\\
229 - How?\\
230 - Oh, a lot of people get discovered.\\
231 - Why, there was...
there was Champ Butler.\\
232 - He was discovered parking cars.\\
233 - And then there was Dorothy Lamour.\\
234 - She was discovered running an
elevator.\\
235 - And then there was Lana Turner.\\
236 - She was discovered at a soda
fountain, sitting on a stool.\\
237 - Well, I don't think I'd be very good\\
238 - at parking cars, and elevators make
me dizzy,\\
239 - but I do know how to sit.\\
240 - Well, great. Why don't you give it a
whirl?\\
241 - What soda fountain was it?\\
242 - The one at Schwab's Drugstore up on
Sunset Boulevard.\\
243 - Schwab's?\\
244 - Schwab's.\\
245 - Schwab's. Thanks a lot.\\
246 - (knock at door)\\
247 - Come in.\\
248 - Hi.
Oh, hi!\\
249 - How did everything go?\\
250 - Oh, Ricky, it was just wonderful.\\
251 - We got the cutest gay '90s costumes
you ever saw.\\
252 - The funniest thing happened in
Wardrobe.\\
253 - Oh, now, Fred, I didn't think that
was very funny.\\
254 - It was pretty funny.\\
255 - What happened, Fred?\\
256 - Well, we had tried on our costumes\\
257 - and were all rest up in our own
clothes ready to leave.\\
258 - Now, Fred.\\
259 - And the head of Wardrobe accused
Ethel\\
260 - of trying to sneak out with one of
his bustles.\\
261 - (guffawing)\\
262 - Oh, that's very funny.\\
263 - (laughing harder)\\
264 - How's Lucy?\\
265 - I don't know.\\
266 - She wasn't home when I got here,\\
267 - and I'm beginning to worry about her
a little bit, you know.\\
268 - She was so blue when I left.\\
269 - Oh, she's probably just gone
sightseeing.\\
270 - Sure.
Oh, here she is.\\
271 - Oh, here she is.\\
272 - Hi, Lucy.\\
273 - Hiya, honey.\\
274 - Hi.
Where you been?\\
275 - I was beginning to worry about you.\\
276 - Well, I've been out not getting in
the movies.\\
277 - What are you talking about?\\
278 - Well, after you three abandoned me
today,\\
279 - I went and sat in Schwab's Drugstore\\
280 - so I could be discovered like Lana
Turner.\\
281 - Oh, no.\\
282 - Yeah, I sat there all afternoon.\\
283 - Well, what happened?
You look kind of funny.\\
284 - Yeah, well, you'd look kind of funny,
too,\\
285 - if you'd just had three chocolate
malts,\\
286 - two hot fudge sundaes,\\
287 - a pineapple soda and a banana split.\\
288 - You ate all that?\\
289 - I had to.\\
290 - It was the only way I could keep my
place at the counter.\\
291 - They have a rule: "No eat, no seat."\\
292 - Aw... and nobody did any discovering?\\
293 - Well, only me.\\
294 - About an hour ago, I discovered I was
getting green.\\
295 - Well, at least she's not blue
anymore.\\
296 - Oh, Fred.\\
297 - Oh, dear.\\
298 - Why don't I give up?\\
299 - The only way I'll ever get in the
movies is to buy a ticket.\\
300 - Oh, now, honey.\\
301 - I just can't go back to New York and
face my friends.\\
302 - As soon as I get to feeling a little
better,\\
303 - I'm gonna kill myself.\\
304 - Now, look, don't you talk like that.\\
305 - Listen, if it means that much to you,\\
306 - well, maybe there's something that I
can do.\\
307 - What?\\
308 - Well, if you just want to say that
you were in a picture,\\
309 - maybe I can call one of the directors
at Metro--\\
310 - I got a couple friends in there--\\
311 - and see if they can give you\\
312 - a little part or something, you know.\\
313 - Ricky, would you?\\
314 - Well, I can't promise you anything,
but I can try.\\
315 - Oh, thank you, honey.\\
316 - I'll call tomorrow morning and see
what they say.\\
317 - Thank you.\\
318 - Hey, Frank.\\
319 - Oh, hi, Ricky.\\
320 - Where's your wife?\\
321 - Oh, she's just coming out of
Wardrobe.\\
322 - She'll be here in a minute.
She is so excited\\
323 - about doing this part in this
picture,\\
324 - you wouldn't believe it, and when she
found out\\
325 - that she gets to die in the scene,
she almost did.\\
326 - Oh, well, it really isn't anything.\\
327 - Well, she thinks she's playing
Camille.\\
328 - She's been practicing how to die all
day long.\\
329 - (chuckling)\\
330 - RICKY: Oh, here she is.\\
331 - Come over here, honey.\\
332 - Come on, I want you to meet your
director.\\
333 - Oh.\\
334 - Frank, this is my wife, Lucy.\\
335 - Frank Williams, the director.\\
336 - How do you do?
How do you do, Mrs. Ricardo?\\
337 - How do you do?
I'm glad to have you with us.\\
338 - Well, thank you. It certainly is nice
to be here.\\
339 - I sure hope I do a good job for you,
sir.\\
340 - Oh, I'm sure you will.\\
341 - Now, here's what I'd like you to do.\\
342 - You're the star of this nightclub
sequence.\\
343 - The star?\\
344 - Now, as our scene opens,\\
345 - you're discovered at the top\\
346 - of the steps with these four girls.\\
347 - On the cue music, you come about
halfway down,\\
348 - a shot rings out, you clutch your
heart and you drop.\\
349 - Yeah. Yes, sir.\\
350 - Yes, sir, I'm pretty excited, but I'm
sure I can do it.\\
351 - That's how simple, honey, huh?\\
352 - Yeah.
You can handle that.\\
353 - I'm sure I can.\\
354 - Now, just be calm, and good luck to
you.\\
355 - Okay, dear, bye.\\
356 - I got a date with Mr. Minnelli,\\
357 - so I got to go.
See you later.\\
358 - Good-bye, honey.
See you, Frank.\\
359 - Good-bye.
Don't worry, now.\\
360 - You'll be all right.
Uh, Nick...\\
361 - Nick, would you get that headdress on
her, please?\\
362 - Oh, boys, no!
That spot-- no.\\
363 - I don't want that there.\\
364 - NICK: Here you are, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
365 - Is that for me?\\
366 - Uh-huh. I'm afraid it's kind of
heavy.\\
367 - Oh, well, that's all right.\\
368 - I'll be able to manage it.\\
369 - Can I let go now?\\
370 - Yeah, that's all right.\\
371 - Thank you.\\
372 - Well, just a minute.\\
373 - Just a minute.\\
374 - Oh, dear.\\
375 - Yeah, well.\\
376 - There.
All right now?\\
377 - There we are. Yes, sir.\\
378 - Thank you.\\
379 - Have you ever worn one of these
before?\\
380 - Well, no, sir, but I-I'm sure that I
can handle it.\\
381 - It's quite a trick. It's just getting
used to balancing it.\\
382 - How's that?\\
383 - Just getting used to balancing it.\\
384 - Oh, yes, I'll be able to! Thanks.\\
385 - All right.\\
386 - All right, places, girls!
Get into positions!\\
387 - FRANK: Line up at the top of the
steps, please.\\
388 - Mrs. Ricardo, would you like...\\
389 - What?\\
390 - Take your position at the top\\
391 - of the steps, please, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
392 - Oh... yes, sir!\\
393 - Thank you.\\
394 - Don't go up too far.
That's it.\\
395 - Now, Would you mind turning around,
please,\\
396 - coming towards the center?\\
397 - A little more to your...\\
398 - A little more to your left, please.\\
399 - Your left.\\
400 - Your left, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
401 - That's it.
Thank you very much.\\
402 - Now, would you tilt your head a
little bit?\\
403 - How's that?\\
404 - Tilt your head a little bit, please.\\
405 - That's fine, that's fine.
Yes, that way.\\
406 - Now, would you drop your arms very
grace... gracefully.\\
407 - That's it. Kind of put your foot out
a little bit,\\
408 - like on your toe...\\
409 - Fine. Do you feel comfortable?\\
410 - No, sir-- yes, sir.\\
411 - That's it.
Now smile, everybody.\\
412 - All right.\\
413 - Hit the music, Harry.\\
414 - (piano playing "A Pretty Girl Is Like
A Melody")\\
415 - Mrs. Ricardo, what seems to be the
trouble?\\
416 - Well, sir, the headdress was just a
little heavy\\
417 - and it sort of tilted forward.\\
418 - I'm-I'm sorry, sir.\\
419 - I'll be able to manage it.\\
420 - Well, I-I don't want you to be
uncomfortable.\\
421 - Perhaps I'd better give it to a
bigger girl.\\
422 - Oh, no, sir. I'm big enough. Thank
you.\\
423 - I can do it.\\
424 - All right, all right, let's try it
once again.\\
425 - Now let's rehearse it this time.\\
426 - All right, fine.
Now, that's it.\\
427 - Now, same positions now.\\
428 - Remember, smile.\\
429 - The hands... see?\\
430 - That's right. Tilt the head a little
bit, girls.\\
431 - Lots of life.\\
432 - All right, music.\\
433 - (piano playing "A Pretty Girl Is Like
A Melody")\\
434 - It's all right.\\
435 - Mrs. Ricardo!\\
436 - Now, what seems to be the problem?\\
437 - Well, my train is caught, sir.\\
438 - It's a nail.\\
439 - I'll get it.\\
440 - Yes, sir.\\
441 - There, that's clear.\\
442 - All right.\\
443 - Okay.\\
444 - Here we are.\\
445 - You know, I...
I'm afraid perhaps\\
446 - this headdress is a little too much
for you.\\
447 - Oh, no, sir, no, sir.
Now, Mr. Williams,\\
448 - my train just got caught.\\
449 - That could happen to anyone, sir.\\
450 - Well, I-I'd feel much better if it
was handled\\
451 - by a girl who could really handle it.\\
452 - Oh, I can, I can handle it, sir.\\
453 - I'm sure I can.\\
454 - Annette, would you kindly switch
headdresses, please?\\
455 - Oh, no, sir, Mr. Williams!\\
456 - Mr. Williams!\\
457 - Yes?\\
458 - Isn't the girl who wears that the one
who gets killed?\\
459 - Yes, that's right.\\
460 - Would you put this on, please?\\
461 - Well, I... I don't really think that\\
462 - that's very fair, Mr. Williams.\\
463 - I... I didn't really get a chance,
you know.\\
464 - Mr. Williams...\\
465 - All right, all right, now, look,\\
466 - now you take Mrs. Ricardo's place in
the center.\\
467 - You'll be the lead girl now.
Thank you.\\
468 - Mrs. Ricardo, would you mind\\
469 - standing over there by the rail?\\
470 - Thank you very much.\\
471 - You're doing very well.\\
472 - Very well, very well.\\
473 - Now let's have a nice walk- through
this time, girls.\\
474 - No stops, like go all the way
through,\\
475 - right up by the rail, please. Thank
you.\\
476 - I'd like to try another run-through
now,\\
477 - only this time I'd like you\\
478 - to come down the stairs a little
faster.\\
479 - Music.\\
480 - (piano playing "A Pretty Girl Is Like
A Melody")\\
481 - Ah!\\
482 - Mrs. Ricardo, just what do you think
you're doing?\\
483 - Well, you said you wanted us to come
down a little faster.\\
484 - I'm sorry I tripped on my train.\\
485 - It was sort of a train trip.\\
486 - You like to try it once more, please?\\
487 - Mr. Williams, are you sure\\
488 - you don't want me to be the girl who
gets killed?\\
489 - Please, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
490 - Wouldn't you like to see me die?\\
491 - Don't tempt me.\\
492 - Well, I-I certainly wish\\
493 - I could be the girl who dies, Mr.
Williams,\\
494 - because it means so much to me, you
know. I...\\
495 - Mrs. Ricardo...\\
496 - I have rehearsed it a lot.
I know what...\\
497 - Mrs. Ricardo...\\
498 - I'm sure that if you could see me do
it,\\
499 - Mrs. Ricardo...
you'd appreciate that I'd\\
500 - probably do it better than any of the
girls.\\
501 - Would you please let me get a word in
edgewise?\\
502 - Yes, sir. I just felt that\\
503 - you should know how I feel about it,
you know.\\
504 - Yes, I certainly do.\\
505 - Mrs. Ricardo, would you please\\
506 - get up to the top of the stairs
there?\\
507 - We'll try it once more.\\
508 - Just once more, please.\\
509 - I'd like to rehearse it.\\
510 - Please.\\
511 - Thank you very much.\\
512 - You're doing very, very well.\\
513 - Doing beautifully.\\
514 - Yes. Uh, could we hurry it a little?\\
515 - You see, we're a little behind on
schedule.\\
516 - Thank you very much.\\
517 - All right.
Are we all set now?\\
518 - All right, remember, girls, now,
smile.\\
519 - Smile pretty.\\
520 - That's it. Music.\\
521 - (piano playing "A Pretty Girl Is Like
A Melody")\\
522 - (gunshot)\\
523 - Mrs. Ricardo, just...\\
524 - just what do you think you're doing?\\
525 - That shot was supposed to be for the
other girl.\\
526 - Well, he missed.\\
527 - Look, Mrs. Ricardo, you just don't
seem to understand.\\
528 - You see, I-I-I'm the director on this
picture.\\
529 - Yes, sir, I know that.\\
530 - See, I make all the decisions.\\
531 - I say what happens on this set.\\
532 - I understand that, sir.\\
533 - You understand that.\\
534 - You know, one more thing like this,\\
535 - and you won't be in this picture at
all.\\
536 - Oh, well, look, Mr. Williams,\\
537 - I-I just feel that I just have to be
the girl who dies.\\
538 - You see, you don't understand.\\
539 - I-I couldn't go back to New York\\
540 - and face my friends.\\
541 - I've told them that I'm going to be
in a picture,\\
542 - and I, and I can't just let it be
walk-on-and-off, you know.\\
543 - This is my big chance.\\
544 - Yeah, so I understand.\\
545 - Yeah, well, you see, all right, Mrs.
Ricardo.\\
546 - I've told them for months and months
and months,\\
547 - you know, and I...
Yes, Mrs. Ricardo...\\
548 - and then when I got this,\\
549 - I figured it was going to be a really
big thing, you know.\\
550 - I really understand-- believe me, I
feel for you--\\
551 - but you've got to understand my
situation, too.\\
552 - Well, you know how friends back home
are, you know.\\
553 - Yes. Oh, yes, I know how friends are,\\
554 - but, you see, I have a problem, too.\\
555 - I know, but the problem is...\\
556 - I'd like to get this picture done\\
557 - before the end of this year.\\
558 - I understand that.\\
559 - Thank you.\\
560 - I understand that.\\
561 - So, you can be the girl who dies.\\
562 - Oh!\\
563 - Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.\\
564 - I'd like that headdress, please.\\
565 - Oh, hold it!
No, no, wait.\\
566 - Wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
567 - I-I-I've got an entirely new concept
for this scene.\\
568 - Much more dramatic.\\
569 - Oh?\\
570 - Yes. You are going to be discovered
dead\\
571 - as the scene opens.\\
572 - I'm already dead?\\
573 - Already dead.\\
574 - Oh, uh, but...\\
575 - Oh, no, no, no, no-- no buts.\\
576 - You just lie down here, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
577 - Just lie down.\\
578 - Thank you very much.\\
579 - Just lie down.\\
580 - Uh... face down.\\
581 - Face down?!\\
582 - Face down.\\
583 - But Mr. Williams, I've seen lots of
pictures,\\
584 - and when people die, they don't
usually die face down.\\
585 - They die face up into the camera.\\
586 - Okay, okay, we'll do it another way.\\
587 - Oh, thank you.\\
588 - Yeah. Uh, boys, will you bring in the
stretcher, please?\\
589 - This will work very, very well.\\
590 - It's very dramatic, too.\\
591 - Would you lie down on the stretcher,
please?\\
592 - Thank you very much.\\
593 - Face up?\\
594 - Face up.\\
595 - Yes, sir.\\
596 - All set?\\
597 - All set.\\
598 - There we are.\\
599 - All right, now, girls, as we start
this scene now...\\
600 - Mr. Williams...\\
601 - how will my friends know it's me?\\
602 - Your feet will be showing.\\
603 - Oh, swell.\\
604 - All right, now, boys, will you change
the setup now?\\
605 - I'll be right back.\\
606 - And, girls, I'd like...\\
607 - Where are you going now?\\
608 - I'm going to powder my feet.\\
609 - All right, girls, will you gather
round here, please?\\
610 - In this setup here...\\
611 - Hi!\\
612 - Oh, hi, Ricky.\\
613 - How's Lucy?\\
614 - Oh, she's fine.\\
615 - I'm a nervous wreck.\\
616 - What happened?
Something went wrong?\\
617 - Oh, no, no, no, everything's fine.\\
618 - Oh, good.\\
619 - Okay, sir, we're ready to go.\\
620 - Are the attendants ready?\\
621 - Yes, sir.\\
622 - All right, well, where's the dead
woman?\\
623 - LUCY: Here I am.\\
624 - Oh, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
625 - Fine. Would you excuse me a moment,
Ricky?\\
626 - Sure.\\
627 - We'll get on with this scene.\\
628 - Will you just lie down here, please?\\
629 - Yes.
Thank you very much.\\
630 - Pick up the sheet, please.\\
631 - Yes. I'll just put your dress up here
nicely.\\
632 - There we are.\\
633 - All right, there.\\
634 - Could you cover her?\\
635 - Oh, that's beautiful.\\
636 - Now, remember,\\
637 - this is a very dramatic scene.\\
638 - You're very sad. You're very upset.
Lots of emotion.\\
639 - Let's get this scene done this time.\\
640 - Not a word from anyone.
Ready? Roll 'em.\\
641 - FRANK: Action!\\
642 - (all sobbing)\\
643 - Cut! Print it! Thanks!\\
644 - That's beautiful! All right, boys,
you can take it away now.\\
645 - Oh, girls, that was just wonderful.\\
646 - Just wonderful.
Just wonderful.\\
647 - Lucy, what happened?\\
648 - Nothing.\\
649 - Well, that's not the way that they
explained the scene to me,\\
650 - nobody will know who you are.\\
651 - Oh, well, I'm not too unhappy.\\
652 - That's show business, you know,
darling.\\
653 - I'm sorry, Ricky, but...\\
654 - Well, that's all right.
At least you got in the picture.\\
655 - That's right.
Sure.\\
656 - Excuse me, sir, but, uh...\\
657 - What?\\
658 - Mrs. Ricardo...\\
659 - Yeah, well, let's go, Ricky.\\
660 - May I see your feet, please?\\
661 - Certainly.\\
662 - You know what I mean.\\
663 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
664 - ANNOUNCER: The director was Lou
Krugman, the bellboy was Bobby
Jellison,\\
665 - Dick was Louie Nicoletti and the
showgirl was Onna Conners.\\
666 - I Love Lucy is a Desilu Production.\\
667 - Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz\\
668 - will be back next week at this same
time.
\subsection {Episode 20: The Fashion Show}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Well?\\
3 - Well?\\
4 - Do you see anything different about
me?\\
5 - No.\\
6 - Two legs, two arms, one head.\\
7 - Oh, you know,\\
8 - what I mean.\\
9 - Did I get any suntan?\\
10 - No.\\
11 - Oh, darn it.\\
12 - Honey, why don't you give up trying
to get a suntan?\\
13 - You always get burned with your fur
skin.\\
14 - Well... my "fur skin"?\\
15 - Hi, fellas.\\
16 - Hi.
Hi.\\
17 - Say, we're gonna drive up to Pomona
tomorrow afternoon, Lucy.\\
18 - We thought maybe you'd like to go
with us.\\
19 - Okay.\\
20 - What's the matter with her?\\
21 - Oh, she's upset because she can't get
a suntan.\\
22 - Oh, what's the difference?\\
23 - There's a lot of difference out here.\\
24 - Oh, I'll say there is.\\
25 - We went down to Beverly Hills
yesterday,\\
26 - and those women all had the most
beautiful tans.\\
27 - It was embarrassing.\\
28 - Ethel and I looked like a couple of
marshmallows.\\
29 - ETHEL: Sure did.\\
30 - Gee, I'd love to get a tan.\\
31 - You know what I'd like to look like?\\
32 - A toasted marshmallow.\\
33 - No. I'd like to look like I belong in
Beverly Hills.\\
34 - Oh... even if you've got a tan, it
wouldn't help.\\
35 - Did you notice the beautiful clothes\\
36 - those women were wearing?\\
37 - Yeah, you're right.\\
38 - I'd just look like a tacky toasted
marshmallow...\\
39 - unless, of course,\\
40 - I could buy some beautiful clothes\\
41 - like those women were wearing.\\
42 - I would dearly love to have just one
dress\\
43 - from an exclusive salon like Don
Loper's.\\
44 - Oh, yes, it would just set you up for
life\\
45 - if you could open your closet door
and see one Loper label.\\
46 - Yeah, what's the sense of dreaming?\\
47 - Well, now, wait a minute, honeybunch.\\
48 - Maybe we can figure something out.\\
49 - Who said that?\\
50 - It sounded like Fred, but I don't
believe it!\\
51 - Fred, you really mean it?\\
52 - Sure.\\
53 - Oh...\\
54 - What do you think he'd charge for one
label?\\
55 - ETHEL: Oh, fine.\\
56 - (laughing)\\
57 - Ricky... Ricky, you're not going to
say no, are you?\\
58 - Look, all I want is just one simple,
little,\\
59 - ordinary, plain dress from Loper's.\\
60 - I'll buy the cheapest one he has.
Honest, I will.\\
61 - Honest, I will.\\
62 - Well, it's a thought.\\
63 - If you... It is?\\
64 - Yeah.		Oh!\\
65 - (stammering)\\
66 - Honey, oh...!\\
67 - Oh, you agreed so fast, my brain blew
a fuse!\\
68 - (chuckling)\\
69 - Oh!\\
70 - Wait a minute. I just said it was a
thought.\\
71 - Yeah, I know, honey, I know.\\
72 - Well, h-how much is a dress at
Loper's?\\
73 - Well, it wouldn't be very much.\\
74 - How much?\\
75 - Well, not very much, really, for what
you'd be getting.\\
76 - Well, how much?\\
77 - Practically nothing.\\
78 - Could you break that "nothing" into
dollars?\\
79 - Well, uh, just for one simple,
ordinary, plain,\\
80 - little old nothing dress... $100?\\
81 - (choking)\\
82 - (choking)\\
83 - (with hoarse voice): $100 for one
dress?\\
84 - The reason he almost choked to death\\
85 - is because $100 is all I've spent on
clothes\\
86 - ever since we've been married.\\
87 - Ah-ha, that's very good, Ethel, very
good.\\
88 - Well, see you later.\\
89 - Hup-bup-bup- bup-bup-bup.\\
90 - You didn't answer my question.\\
91 - Well, uh, I thought it over very
carefully,\\
92 - and I, uh, I have given due
consideration\\
93 - to the fact that this might be the
only time\\
94 - that we're out here in Hollywood.\\
95 - That's right.\\
96 - But the only answer I can arrive at
is...\\
97 - yes.\\
98 - Oh, honey!\\
99 - Thank you!\\
100 - Only one.\\
101 - That's all I want!
That's all I want!\\
102 - Boy, fancy-schmancy.\\
103 - Ethel!\\
104 - What?\\
105 - Why do you have to act like a rube?\\
106 - Because I am a rube, and so are you.\\
107 - I know it,\\
108 - but let's try to act at home here at
Don Loper's.\\
109 - Well, it's kind of difficult when
your permanent address\\
110 - has always been Gimbels' basement.\\
111 - Hey, where are all the racks of
dresses?\\
112 - There aren't any.\\
113 - What do you paw through?\\
114 - You don't "paw" through anything.\\
115 - Get your mind out of that basement.\\
116 - They bring the dresses in one at a
time.\\
117 - How do you know?\\
118 - I've heard.\\
119 - What are we whispering for?\\
120 - I don't know.\\
121 - This is just a place you
automatically whisper in.\\
122 - Come on, sit down and shut up.\\
123 - Good morning, ladies.\\
124 - Good morning.
Oh, how do you do?\\
125 - May I be of assistance?\\
126 - Yes. I'd like to see a dress, please,
size 12.\\
127 - Certainly.\\
128 - Oh, and, uh...\\
129 - (nervous chuckle)\\
130 - An original.\\
131 - Gee, wait till the girls back home\\
132 - find out I bought a dress from here.\\
133 - Oh, Jane Sebastian will be absolutely
green.\\
134 - Of course, she'll pretend she doesn't
notice it.\\
135 - Listen, she'll notice this Don Loper
label\\
136 - if I have to wear the dress
wrong-side-out.\\
137 - You would, too.\\
138 - This creation is one of Mr. Loper's
newest.\\
139 - Notice the dropped waistline...\\
140 - and the simple neck\\
141 - that's designed to be worn with
dozens of strands of beads.\\
142 - Oh, yes. I could wear that with my...
uh...\\
143 - Oh, yes, it's lovely.\\
144 - Yes, it's, it's not quite what I had
in mind, though.\\
145 - Close, but not quite.\\
146 - Uh, could I see something else,
please?\\
147 - Why, certainly.\\
148 - You didn't ask her the price.\\
149 - Ethel, you don't ask the price\\
150 - in a place like this.\\
151 - You don't?\\
152 - Of course not.\\
153 - You wait till they turn their back\\
154 - and you sneak a look at the price
tag.\\
155 - What's the matter?\\
156 - I got my ring caught on something.\\
157 - Here's something you might like.\\
158 - I think this is one of the smartest
dresses\\
159 - in the whole collection.\\
160 - Oh, it's lovely, isn't it, Ethel?\\
161 - Oh, yes, it's very nice.\\
162 - It's imported material, of course.\\
163 - Of course.\\
164 - Just feel.\\
165 - Uh...\\
166 - Oh, yes, that is a nice piece of
goods.\\
167 - If you'd like to try it on,\\
168 - you can step right into the dressing
room.\\
169 - Uh, no, no, I'd rather not try any on
just yet.\\
170 - I... I'd like to see a few more
first.\\
171 - Why, certainly.\\
172 - Oh, let me take that out of your way.\\
173 - Uh, no, no.\\
174 - I'm still considering this one, if
you don't mind.\\
175 - Very well.\\
176 - Thank you.\\
177 - Help me.\\
178 - What's it caught on?\\
179 - The price tag.\\
180 - There it is.\\
181 - (loud gasp)\\
182 - $500!\\
183 - It can't be!\\
184 - But it is.\\
185 - Well, back to Gimbels' basement.\\
186 - No, no. This is my only chance to get
a Don Loper original.\\
187 - It's your chance to get a black eye
from Ricky, too.\\
188 - They can't all be this expensive.\\
189 - This is probably high-priced because
it's so fancy.\\
190 - I'll ask her for something plainer
and simpler.\\
191 - Oh, I think you're just asking for
trouble.\\
192 - Well, let me worry about that, will
you?\\
193 - Here's something you might like.\\
194 - This color would be stunning with
your hair.\\
195 - (chuckling): Oh, really?\\
196 - Uh, it's, it's very nice.\\
197 - Um, but, you know, I've been
thinking.\\
198 - I think I'd like to see something
simpler and plainer.\\
199 - And cheaper.\\
200 - She means "deeper"-- deeper in the
neckline.\\
201 - Deeper than this?\\
202 - Oh, well, I, I, I...\\
203 - Could I see something else?\\
204 - Certainly.\\
205 - Hello, Amzie.\\
206 - Mrs. MacRae.\\
207 - Is Mr. Loper in?\\
208 - Certainly. I'll tell him you're here.\\
209 - Thank you.\\
210 - We're gonna get to see Don Loper.\\
211 - Not only that, but do you know who
that is?\\
212 - No. Who?\\
213 - Gordon MacRae's wife.\\
214 - Oh, of course it is.\\
215 - I've seen dozens of pictures of her.\\
216 - Yeah.
She was an actress\\
217 - and she gave up her career to have a
family.\\
218 - That's right, just like me.\\
219 - Good morning, Sheila.\\
220 - Hello, Don.\\
221 - How are you?\\
222 - Very well, darling.\\
223 - You're looking enormously pretty
today.\\
224 - Thank you.\\
225 - How's our fashion show coming along?\\
226 - Oh, Don, it's wonderful.\\
227 - You know, I think it's going to be\\
228 - the best fashion show we've ever
have.\\
229 - Well, I hope so, because\\
230 - we've put an enormous amount of
effort behind it.\\
231 - You know, I'd like to check\\
232 - some of the last-minute details with
you.\\
233 - All right.\\
234 - Now, has everybody been in for a
fitting?\\
235 - I don't really know, darling.\\
236 - Let me go and see the list and I'll
check with you.\\
237 - You know what they're talking about?\\
238 - No. What?\\
239 - I read about it in the paper.\\
240 - They're having a fashion show here,
and the proceeds\\
241 - go to a charity called SHARE,
Incorporated,\\
242 - and it's made up of movie stars'
wives,\\
243 - and the movie stars' wives\\
244 - are going to be wearing the clothes.\\
245 - No kidding.	    Yeah.\\
246 - Now I have it here.\\
247 - Well, it turns out that Mrs. Dean
Martin's been in.\\
248 - Mrs. Dean Martin.\\
249 - Mrs. Forrest Tucker...\\
250 - Mrs. Van Heflin...\\
251 - Mrs. William Holden...\\
252 - LOPER: Mrs. Richard Carlson...\\
253 - Everybody but Mrs. Joel McCrea.\\
254 - (gasping): I forgot!\\
255 - Frances can't come; she's leaving for
Europe.\\
256 - She phoned me.\\
257 - LOPER: Well, This is a fine time to
tell me, darling.\\
258 - The show is tomorrow.\\
259 - Oh, Don, who are we gonna get to take
her place?\\
260 - It has to be the wife of a star,\\
261 - the publicity's out.\\
262 - LOPER: Yeah, I don't even know who's
left in town.\\
263 - Uh, pardon me.\\
264 - Could I use your phone, please?\\
265 - Oh, please make my phone yours.\\
266 - (chuckling): Oh.\\
267 - Hello. Is this MGM?\\
268 - I'd like to speak to Mr. Ricky
Ricardo, please,\\
269 - the star of Don Juan?\\
270 - Yes, this is Mrs. Ricardo, the star's
wife.\\
271 - Mrs. Ricky Ricardo, wife of the movie
star...\\
272 - Ricky Ricardo.\\
273 - Yes.\\
274 - Oh? Oh, he isn't there.\\
275 - Oh, would you give him a message,
please?\\
276 - LUCY: Would you be so kind as to tell
him\\
277 - that I've been detained at the Don
Loper Salon?\\
278 - (with heavy accent): Thank you very
much.\\
279 - Well, that was a subtle performance.\\
280 - Shut up.\\
281 - This is about the simplest dress I
could find.\\
282 - We call it "Loper's basic dress."\\
283 - You can accessorize it beautifully.\\
284 - Well, accessorization is what she's
really looking for.\\
285 - I couldn't help overhearing your
telephone conversation.\\
286 - Oh?\\
287 - You are Mrs. Ricky Ricardo, aren't
you?\\
288 - Oh, yes.\\
289 - Well, I'm Sheila MacRae.\\
290 - Oh, how do you do?\\
291 - How do you do?\\
292 - Uh, Mrs. Gordon MacRae, Mrs. Fred
Mertz.\\
293 - How do you do?
How do you do?\\
294 - We've been reading a lot about your
husband lately.\\
295 - Oh. Yes, he has been getting quite a
bit of publicity,\\
296 - hasn't he?\\
297 - You know, I know this is awfully
short notice,\\
298 - but we're having a fashion show for
charity,\\
299 - Oh.	and the wives of the stars\\
300 - are going to model the gowns.\\
301 - Oh, how nice.\\
302 - And one of the girls dropped out...\\
303 - I'd love to.\\
304 - I beg your pardon?\\
305 - Weren't you going to ask me to be in
it?\\
306 - Oh, yes, I was.\\
307 - I'd love to.
Good.\\
308 - Uh, which one of these did you buy?\\
309 - Uh... that one.\\
310 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
311 - Don!\\
312 - Yes, Sheila?\\
313 - How can I be of service?\\
314 - Mrs. Ricardo, this is Mr. Don Loper.\\
315 - How do you do, Mrs. Ricardo?\\
316 - Hi.
Welcome to my house.\\
317 - Oh, well, thank you.\\
318 - I'd have been here sooner, but I'm
from the East--\\
319 - New York City-- Upper.\\
320 - Oh!\\
321 - Well, I'm so pleased to see that
you're in Hollywood.\\
322 - You make our city so much prettier.\\
323 - (chuckling): Oh!\\
324 - Uh, oh, Mr. Loper, this is Mrs. Fred
Mertz.\\
325 - How do you do, Mrs. Mertz?\\
326 - (giggling): Oh, Mr. Loper...\\
327 - What's our problem, Sheila?\\
328 - Don, Mrs. Ricardo has consented\\
329 - to help us out tomorrow in the
fashion show.\\
330 - Wonderful, Mrs. Ricardo.
I've very flattered.\\
331 - Well, I'd certainly be delighted.\\
332 - And she's going to wear this.\\
333 - And I'll tell you what, Amzie,\\
334 - take Mrs. Ricardo to the fitting room\\
335 - and have it fitted immediately,\\
336 - and we'll give it to you at noon.\\
337 - Oh, wonderful!\\
338 - Right this way.\\
339 - Oh, yes, yes.
Pardon me.\\
340 - Certainly.
Thank you.\\
341 - I'm delighted that you're going to be
with us.\\
342 - I'm delighted that I'm...\\
343 - Thank you.\\
344 - Oh, honestly...\\
345 - Well, at least I've got a Don Loper
dress.\\
346 - Yes, with a Don Loper label and a
mystery price tag.\\
347 - Oh, Ethel, don't try to spoil things.\\
348 - Well, I can't help it.\\
349 - It's just fantastic to me that you
would buy a dress\\
350 - and walk out of the store and not
know what it cost.\\
351 - Well, I was trapped.\\
352 - they shoved me into a fitting room,\\
353 - they stuck some pins in me\\
354 - and they grabbed the dress\\
355 - and I didn't get a chance to look at
the price tag.\\
356 - Why would you buy any dress\\
357 - without looking at the price tag?\\
358 - Because I wanted to be in the fashion
show.\\
359 - I had to buy the dress.\\
360 - Well, why did you have to be in a
fashion show?\\
361 - What is this, 20 questions?\\
362 - For heaven's sake, Ethel,\\
363 - a little plain dress like this
couldn't cost more than $100.\\
364 - Well, it'd better not cost more than
$100\\
365 - 'cause that's all Ricky said you
could spend,\\
366 - and if it's more than that,\\
367 - I'd hate to be around when he... Oh!\\
368 - It can't be.\\
369 - But it is.\\
370 - Doesn't Loper know any other numbers
but 5-0-0?\\
371 - Oh, this is even worse than I
thought.\\
372 - A plain, simple, little dress like
this for $500?\\
373 - I don't believe it.\\
374 - How are you gonna explain the extra
cost to Ricky?\\
375 - I don't know.
I don't know.\\
376 - Well, you can't take it back.\\
377 - It's been altered.\\
378 - Yeah, when Ricky finds out about it,
I'll be altered.\\
379 - Well, there's just one thing to do.\\
380 - What?\\
381 - Aren't you going to stop me?\\
382 - Why? I can't think of a better way
out.\\
383 - Well, it isn't high enough anyway.\\
384 - Oh, dear.\\
385 - Look, Ricky was gonna let me spend
100.\\
386 - And I'm gonna do the fashion show,\\
387 - so the publicity should be worth the
extra 400.\\
388 - 400!\\
389 - Oh, for heaven's sake, what am I
gonna do?\\
390 - How am I gonna get out of this?\\
391 - Oh, that shouldn't be difficult\\
392 - for an old escape artist like you.\\
393 - Yeah. Yeah, I got to think.\\
394 - I can't think of a thing.\\
395 - Oh, sure you can.\\
396 - No, I can't.\\
397 - Something's happened to my... my
brain.\\
398 - It's all dried up.\\
399 - Maybe you stayed out in that sun too
long this morning.\\
400 - Oh, please, Ethel. Just help...\\
401 - That's it.\\
402 - Ethel, that's the best idea you ever
had.\\
403 - Thanks. What is it?\\
404 - The sun!\\
405 - You know how easily I burn.\\
406 - Yes.\\
407 - Well, I'm going down by the pool and
stay there until I get red.\\
408 - Not really burn, but just red enough\\
409 - so that I can pretend I'm in terrible
pain.\\
410 - Ricky wouldn't dare hit me in that
condition.\\
411 - Hey, that is a good idea I had.\\
412 - I'd better get out there.
There isn't much sun today.\\
413 - I thought you were gonna go to Pomona
with us.\\
414 - Oh, you go. I'll see you later.\\
415 - Okay.\\
416 - Honey, I'm home.\\
417 - ETHEL: Ricky?\\
418 - Yeah?
Ricky, I've been waiting\\
419 - for you to come home.\\
420 - I want you to help me.\\
421 - Maybe you could talk some sense into
Fred.\\
422 - What's the matter with him?\\
423 - Oh, he wants to sell our apartment
house in New York\\
424 - and buy an orange grove out by
Pomona.\\
425 - So, what's the matter with that?\\
426 - You don't know anything about raising
oranges.\\
427 - That's what's the matter with that.\\
428 - So what? The oranges know what to do.\\
429 - I think you'd better think about it
twice.\\
430 - Where's Lucy?\\
431 - Lucy?\\
432 - Yes?\\
433 - RICKY: Honey!\\
434 - Honey, what happened?
Oh...\\
435 - I guess it wasn't as overcast as I
thought.\\
436 - Oh, you poor little thing.\\
437 - Hey, that gives me an idea.\\
438 - If the orange crop fails, I can raise
tomatoes.\\
439 - Honey, how did you get so...?\\
440 - (screaming)\\
441 - Don't touch me.\\
442 - Oh, sweet...
Sit down, baby.\\
443 - Oh, no, I can't sit down!\\
444 - The back of my leg is so burned, I
can't bend my knees.\\
445 - Oh, mi.\\
446 - Well, h-how-how did it happen, honey?\\
447 - Did-did-did-did you, uh, fall asleep
in the sun?\\
448 - You feel sorry for me, don't you,
dear?\\
449 - Of course I do, sweetheart.\\
450 - Well, I'll tell you how it happened.\\
451 - I went to Don Loper's this morning\\
452 - and I bought a dress.\\
453 - Oh, you bought a dress.\\
454 - Yeah, and it cost $500 and...\\
455 - $500?!\\
456 - Yes, $500!\\
457 - $500 for one dress?!
Yes!\\
458 - Yes. Well, Ricky, I can explain.\\
459 - You cannot explain $500 for one
dress.\\
460 - Take it back.\\
461 - Well, that-that-that isn't as easy as
it sounds.\\
462 - Why? Don't tell me it was on sale.\\
463 - No, but, uh...\\
464 - well, then take it back.\\
465 - But, uh...\\
466 - But no buts.\\
467 - No but, no-no bu-bu-bu-bu-buts.\\
468 - I don't want any arguments about it.\\
469 - You got to take the dress back.\\
470 - Mira que tiene quinientos pesos por
un vestido!\\
471 - Piensa que soy millionario,\\
472 - quinientos pesos por un vestido.\\
473 - Que te pasa-- esta loca en la cabeza?\\
474 - And I don't want to hear one more
word about it.\\
475 - I wasn't gonna say anything.\\
476 - Yeah, but you were thinking about
saying something.\\
477 - (phone ringing)\\
478 - $500!
Ay-ay-ay!\\
479 - (door slamming)\\
480 - (phone ringing)\\
481 - Hello?\\
482 - Hello. May I speak with Mrs. Ricardo?\\
483 - This is Mrs. Ricardo.\\
484 - Oh, Mrs. Ricardo, this is Don Loper.\\
485 - Oh. Yes?\\
486 - I've made a terrible mistake.\\
487 - The dress you chose to wear in the
fashion show\\
488 - is exactly like the one I made for
Mrs. Alan Ladd.\\
489 - And now she's decided that she wants\\
490 - to wear her own dress in the show.\\
491 - Oh, well, that's all right, really,
because...\\
492 - You're a living doll.\\
493 - I'll tell you what I'm going to do,
though.\\
494 - I've just designed a marvelous tweed
suit.\\
495 - And it'll look wonderful on you.\\
496 - And if you'll wear that in the show,\\
497 - I'll give you the dress you took
home.\\
498 - Give?!\\
499 - That's right.\\
500 - For nothing?\\
501 - Free.\\
502 - F-r-e-e-e?\\
503 - Exactly.\\
504 - Oh. Oh, that's just wonderful.\\
505 - I'll see you at the fashion show.
Good-bye.\\
506 - Bye.\\
507 - Ethel, that was Don Loper.\\
508 - And he says if I wear something else
in the fashion show,\\
509 - he'll give me my dress for nothing.\\
510 - You can't be in a fashion show\\
511 - in that condition.\\
512 - Oh, yes, I can.\\
513 - What are you gonna wear-- a coat of
unguentine?\\
514 - Oh, Ethel, I just gotta, I just
gotta,\\
515 - and then, and then, and then when I
come home,\\
516 - I can tell old grumpy in there to
relax\\
517 - and it didn't cost him a cent.\\

\subsection {Episode 21: The Hedda Hopper Story}
1 - ("I love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Operator, are you sure you're calling
the right number\\
3 - in New York City?\\
4 - Murray Hill 5-9-0-9-9.\\
5 - Well, I don't understand it.
They should answer.\\
6 - Ay, mira que tienen cosas los
periodicos estos aqui.\\
7 - What's the matter, dear?\\
8 - La senora esta, la senora Hedda
Hooper--\\
9 - nunca me pone el nombre a mi en el
periodico.\\
10 - Nunca la senora Hedda Hooper\\
11 - me pone el nombre en el periodico a
mi.\\
12 - Look, Ricky, I lied to you before we
were married.\\
13 - I really don't understand Spanish.\\
14 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
15 - Now, what's the matter with Hedda
Hooper?\\
16 - We've been here five whole weeks,\\
17 - and she hasn't had my name in the
paper once.\\
18 - And neither has Louella Parsons.\\
19 - All they talk about\\
20 - is Marilyn Monroe, Marilyn Monroe,
Marilyn Monroe.\\
21 - What has Marilyn Monroe got that I
haven't got?\\
22 - Well, I'm sorry, dear.\\
23 - But you'll get your own publicity in
due time.\\
24 - Yeah, well, I'm gonna get my own
publicity agent.\\
25 - That's what I'm gonna do.\\
26 - That's a good idea.
Yeah.\\
27 - Yes? Oh.\\
28 - Well, thank you very much, operator.\\
29 - They don't answer.\\
30 - I wonder where Mother and Little
Ricky are.\\
31 - I've been calling the apartment all
morning.\\
32 - Well, maybe they went to the park.\\
33 - Well, they wouldn't stay in the park
this long.\\
34 - You don't think something could have
happened.\\
35 - Oh, I don't know.\\
36 - Your mother in the park\\
37 - with all those squirrels running
around...\\
38 - Oh... stop it.\\
39 - Hey, maybe they're on their way out
here.\\
40 - In her last letter, she said they
were getting ready.\\
41 - Oh, don't you think she would have
let us know?\\
42 - You take that back.\\
43 - What?\\
44 - What you were thinking when you said,
"Yeah."\\
45 - Anyway, Mother wouldn't forget to
send a wire.\\
46 - No. Let's just hope that\\
47 - she doesn't forget to bring the baby
with her.\\
48 - Oh, honey.\\
49 - Morning.\\
50 - Hi. Come in.\\
51 - Oh, hi. Oh, I don't care.
I know one thing.\\
52 - If we don't hear soon, I'm gonna call
Mrs. Trumball.\\
53 - What's the matter, honey?\\
54 - I've been calling New York all
morning.\\
55 - There's no answer in the apartment.\\
56 - Well, maybe your mother took the baby
to the park.\\
57 - (doorbell buzzing)
They wouldn't stay\\
58 - in the park for four hours.\\
59 - ETHEL: Oh, you're just worrying
'cause you're so far away.\\
60 - Well, it's cold back there now, you
know.\\
61 - It's the middle of winter, you don't
stay in the park...\\
62 - Oh, hi, Bobby.		Hi.\\
63 - Telegram for me?\\
64 - Well, I don't know\\
65 - whether it's for you or not.\\
66 - We've been trying to figure it out\\
67 - down at the desk.\\
68 - Now, it's either for you\\
69 - or we'll have to forward it to Japan.\\
70 - Why?\\
71 - Who is it addressed to?\\
72 - Mrs. Mickey Mikado.\\
73 - It's from your mother.\\
74 - What's it say?\\
75 - "Arriving 9:30 with little Ricky.
Love, mother."\\
76 - He's little Ricky, and I'm big
Mickey.\\
77 - Well, at least, she sent us a wire,\\
78 - told us she's arriving at 9:30.\\
79 - Hurray for Mother.\\
80 - A.M. Or P.M.?\\
81 - She doesn't say.\\
82 - What day?\\
83 - She doesn't say.\\
84 - What airline?\\
85 - She doesn't say.\\
86 - Whatever happened to that woman's
brain?\\
87 - She doesn't say.\\
88 - Come on, give it to me.\\
89 - Maybe I can figure it out.\\
90 - They sent the wire last night,\\
91 - so they must be arriving at 9:30 this
morning.\\
92 - I'll call the airport.\\
93 - National Airport, please.\\
94 - Gee, maybe they're waiting for us out
there right now.\\
95 - Uh, flight information.\\
96 - Oh, why didn't they deliver that
telegram sooner?\\
97 - Just be thankful you didn't have to
wait\\
98 - till it came back from Japan marked\\
99 - "not known at this pagoda."\\
100 - Oh, Fred.\\
101 - Hello?\\
102 - Will you please tell me\\
103 - if any of the airlines have a flight
due in\\
104 - at 9:30 this morning?\\
105 - Well, how about 9:30 tonight?\\
106 - No, huh?\\
107 - Well, thank you very...\\
108 - Wait a minute. Maybe there's a flight
number 930.\\
109 - Hold it. Okay.\\
110 - Uh, any of the airlines have a flight
number 930?\\
111 - Yes?\\
112 - What time is it due in?\\
113 - 1:55.\\
114 - Good!\\
115 - From Bombay?\\
116 - Bombay?\\
117 - Well, with your mother, it...\\
118 - No, no, even she wouldn't go\\
119 - from New York to Los Angeles by way
of India.\\
120 - Thank you very much.\\
121 - Don't say it. You're right, but don't
say it.\\
122 - What are you going to do now, Rick?\\
123 - Well, we'll just have to stay here\\
124 - and wait for her to find us.\\
125 - Oh, honey, she might never find us.\\
126 - Yeah.\\
127 - She's got the baby with her.\\
128 - (phone ringing)\\
129 - I'll get it, honey.\\
130 - Thanks.\\
131 - (phone ringing)\\
132 - I'm telling you.\\
133 - Hello?\\
134 - This is Lucy.\\
135 - Oh, it's Mother. Mother!\\
136 - Mother!\\
137 - Mother, where are you?\\
138 - She's here.	Good.\\
139 - LUCY: How's the baby?
Did he, did he,\\
140 - did he like the plane ride?\\
141 - Oh. Oh, well, Mom, I'm awful sorry we
didn't meet you,\\
142 - But we didn't understand your wire.\\
143 - Tell her to stay right there.
We'll come and get her.\\
144 - Yeah, Mom, listen, you-you stay right
where you are.\\
145 - We'll come and get you.\\
146 - No, now, Mother, please do just as I
say.\\
147 - Stay where you are. We'll come and
get you as soon as we can.\\
148 - Okay, dear. Bye.\\
149 - Come on. Let's all go out to the
airport and get them.\\
150 - Yeah, come on. I don't want your
mother\\
151 - running around loose too long.\\
152 - Come on, let's go.\\
153 - Here we go.\\
154 - Well, I still say we should have
waited out at the airport.\\
155 - I'm sure mother was out there
somewhere.\\
156 - Well, honey, we were there a whole
hour.\\
157 - Yeah, and we looked everyplace\\
158 - but in the wind sock.\\
159 - Oh, Fred, don't make jokes.
I'm serious.\\
160 - I'm worried sick.\\
161 - Well, what are we gonna do, Rick?\\
162 - I don't know, Fred.
I'm whipped.\\
163 - Shh! Shh! Shh!
Shh! Shh! Shh!\\
164 - Keep your voices down.\\
165 - Mother! 		    Hey!\\
166 - For heaven's sake.\\
167 - How are you, dear?\\
168 - Oh, am I glad to see you.\\
169 - Well, long time, no see, Mickey.\\
170 - LUCY: Honey...\\
171 - what are you, what are you doing
here?\\
172 - What am I doing here?\\
173 - Why, you asked me to come out to
California.\\
174 - Oh... Where's the baby?\\
175 - I just put him down, but he's got to
sleep, dear.\\
176 - Oh, honey, we told you to stay there.
What happened?\\
177 - Oh, well, I got so terribly bored
just sitting there.\\
178 - Well, look, Mrs. McGillicuddy,\\
179 - why didn't you stay where you were?\\
180 - I mean, we've been looking all over
the airport.\\
181 - Uh, what for?\\
182 - For you.\\
183 - (chuckling)
Well, now, Mickey,\\
184 - that wasn't very bright.\\
185 - I wasn't at the airport.\\
186 - Well, where were you when you called?\\
187 - Down in the lobby.\\
188 - Down in the lobby?!
Why don't you say...\\
189 - Why didn't you tell Lucy?\\
190 - She didn't ask me.\\
191 - Oh, no!\\
192 - Ay-ay-ay.\\
193 - LUCY: Well, am I glad to see you.\\
194 - Oh! Ricky!\\
195 - Come here, honey.\\
196 - Give him to me.\\
197 - Hello, sweetheart.\\
198 - We had a wonderful time, didn't we?\\
199 - (all clamoring)\\
200 - Look how big he's grown.\\
201 - You bet he's grown.\\
202 - Come on, let me have him.\\
203 - You want him?\\
204 - There you go.\\
205 - Oh, doesn't he look wonderful, honey?\\
206 - Wonderful.\\
207 - Mother, what time did your plane get
in?\\
208 - 12:30.\\
209 - When was it due in?\\
210 - 12:30. Didn't you get my wire?\\
211 - Well, yeah, we got your wire, but it
said 9:30.\\
212 - Well?\\
213 - Well?\\
214 - Please.\\
215 - Um, uh, Mother, why did you tell us
9:30\\
216 - if they told you 12:30?\\
217 - Well, I thought everybody knew\\
218 - that there were three hours'
difference in time\\
219 - between here and New York.\\
220 - Oh, that does it, brother.\\
221 - Now I've heard everything.\\
222 - Don't you let him talk like that
about me.\\
223 - Ricky, now, look, Mother is right.\\
224 - There is three hours' difference in
time.\\
225 - Yeah!\\
226 - Uh...\\
227 - Come here, darling.\\
228 - We'll have our nap.
I know you're tired.\\
229 - ETHEL: We'll show you California when
you get up.\\
230 - FRED: See you later.\\
231 - I'll see you later, son.\\
232 - ETHEL: Bye, honey.\\
233 - LUCY: You're such a good boy.\\
234 - Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.\\
235 - Look, Mrs. Mcgillicuddy.\\
236 - I would like to explain something to
you.\\
237 - In the first place, they meant
Pacific Coast time.\\
238 - And in the second place,\\
239 - if you wanted to allow for the time,\\
240 - you should have added three hours.\\
241 - You did the whole thing backwards.\\
242 - You should have said, "Arriving at
3:30."\\
243 - Oh, poo!\\
244 - Now, look, I'm just trying to explain
to you.\\
245 - Well, you should have said...\\
246 - I can't hear a word you're saying.\\
247 - You see, it's only quarter past 3:00.\\
248 - So, according to you, I'm not even
here yet. Ha!\\
249 - (chuckles derisively)\\
250 - Now, how do you like that?\\
251 - I'm only trying to get her
straightened out\\
252 - and all I get is "poo!" and "ha!"\\
253 - Now just a minute, Ricky.\\
254 - I think she's right about the time.\\
255 - Ethel, Ricky is right.\\
256 - Ethel, how could she be right?
I'm telling you,\\
257 - If it's 3:30 there...\\
258 - If you come from New York...\\
259 - Well, what do you call gain or lose?\\
260 - You listen to me. Look.\\
261 - The sun opens in the east, and it
closes in the west.\\
262 - Oh...\\
263 - (all talking at once)\\
264 - There's the Brown Derby right there,
see?\\
265 - And right over in there is the
Hollywood Bowl.\\
266 - Oh, oh, isn't this exciting?\\
267 - And Mother, this afternoon,\\
268 - we're gonna take you all around\\
269 - and you will just be amazed.\\
270 - Every time you walk down the street,\\
271 - you see movie stars walking right
along.\\
272 - Really?\\
273 - Oh, I hope I see some of my
favorites.\\
274 - Have you seen Ramon Novarro or
Francis X. Bushman?\\
275 - Well, no, I don't think I've seen
them.\\
276 - Oh, and I must see the house where
Rudolph Valentino lived.\\
277 - Oh, I'll never forget him in The
Sheik.\\
278 - I'm the Sheik of Araby\\
279 - Your love belongs to me...\\
280 - Yeah, well, that's very nice, Mother.\\
281 - You know, they're grooming Ricky\\
282 - to be another Rudolph Valentino.\\
283 - Ricky? Ricky who?\\
284 - Ricky me. That's who.\\
285 - You?\\
286 - (mocking laugh)\\
287 - (cackling)\\
288 - (cackling)\\
289 - Oh, dear.\\
290 - Why, you're not fit\\
291 - to touch the hem of his bernouse.\\
292 - What did she say?
What did she say?\\
293 - Que quiere decir bernouse?\\
294 - Now, look, cut it out, you two.\\
295 - We're all here in California
together.\\
296 - Now, let's be friends.\\
297 - Well, all right.\\
298 - I'm sorry, Mother.\\
299 - Oh, that's all right, Mickey.\\
300 - Uh, Mother, you haven't told us a
thing about your trip.\\
301 - Who did you meet on the plane? Anyone
interesting?\\
302 - Oh, oh, yes, I met some lovely
people.\\
303 - The lady next to me was just as sweet
as she could be.\\
304 - Her daughter wants to get into the
movies.\\
305 - I told her to call you at the studio,
Mickey.\\
306 - Oh, you did, eh?\\
307 - And the man across the way,\\
308 - he owns an amusement park in Red
Bluff, California,\\
309 - and, oh, if we ever get up there,\\
310 - little Ricky can ride the
merry-go-round free.\\
311 - Oh, well, that's nice.\\
312 - And the woman behind me was, uh,\\
313 - oh, some kind of a newspaperwoman.\\
314 - Uh, she said she might like to do a
story on you.\\
315 - I invited her over to tea tomorrow
afternoon.\\
316 - Now, look, Mrs. McGillicuddy, I wish
that...\\
317 - Mother, if you're going sightseeing,\\
318 - you'd better get your coat on, dear.\\
319 - All right.\\
320 - I'm the Sheik of Araby...\\
321 - (cackling)\\
322 - Please, honey.\\
323 - Why do you have to get so mad?\\
324 - (phone ringing)
Oh...\\
325 - I'll get it.\\
326 - Hello?\\
327 - Oh, come right up, Mr. Pomerantz.
Yes.\\
328 - Who's that?\\
329 - My new press agent.\\
330 - Well, honey, do you have to see him
now?\\
331 - Yeah, honey, this is business.
I got to see him now.\\
332 - You go take your Mother out.\\
333 - Oh, honey...\\
334 - Okay, I'm ready.\\
335 - Oh, Mother, you go over\\
336 - and pick up the baby at the Mertzes'.\\
337 - I'll be with you in about five
minutes.\\
338 - Oh, all right, dear.\\
339 - Good-bye, Mickey.\\
340 - Good-bye, Mother.\\
341 - (knock at door)\\
342 - Hi, Ricky. I'm Charlie Pomerantz.\\
343 - Oh, hello, hello.\\
344 - Come in, Mr. Pomerantz.\\
345 - Oh, now, Ricky, just call me Charlie.\\
346 - Okay, Charlie.\\
347 - Now, then, you're looking for someone
to give you\\
348 - a real good publicity buildup, right?\\
349 - Well, I need something, boy.\\
350 - I don't seem to get a thing\\
351 - in the motion picture columnist.\\
352 - Is that accent real?\\
353 - What accent?\\
354 - Good. Good.\\
355 - Let me take a look at you.\\
356 - Yeah, handsome, good build.\\
357 - Hey, you know, Ricky,\\
358 - with your looks and talent and my
know-how,\\
359 - we're going places.\\
360 - We are?\\
361 - Dad, I'm going to make you the Cuban
Liberace.\\
362 - Well, I don't know about that, but,
uh...\\
363 - I'd like to see my name in a few of
the columns.\\
364 - Well, let's see, you're doing the
lead in Don Juan.\\
365 - The studio plans to make you the
great lover type, huh?\\
366 - Well, I guess that's right.\\
367 - Yeah, well, that's always a good
angle.\\
368 - We'll start off by linking your name
with glamour girls.\\
369 - You'll be seen at restaurants and
nightclubs,\\
370 - holding hands, dancing, dancing cheek
to cheek.\\
371 - Hold it.\\
372 - I am married.\\
373 - Married?!\\
374 - Yeah.\\
375 - Oh, what did you go and do that for?\\
376 - Well, I'm sorry,\\
377 - but I've been happily married for 14
years.\\
378 - Say... that might be an angle in
itself.\\
379 - No, who would believe it?\\
380 - No, we got to find something for you,
Rick. Something good.\\
381 - Well, Charlie, you're the publicity
agent.\\
382 - You're supposed to dream it up.\\
383 - Hey, hey, wait, wait a minute.\\
384 - That pool gives me an idea.
Can you swim?\\
385 - Now, wait just a minute. I don't want
to dive off that balcony.\\
386 - This is the third floor.\\
387 - No, no, no, no.
Listen, this is the bit.\\
388 - Tomorrow afternoon, the Motion
Picture Mothers Club\\
389 - is having their annual tea here at
the hotel.\\
390 - Now Hedda Hopper always covers it.\\
391 - She's always here.\\
392 - Well?\\
393 - They're having it on the terrace down
by the pool.\\
394 - Now, suppose I arrange for you to
sing at that tea.\\
395 - Yeah?\\
396 - And suppose one of the guests\\
397 - accidentally falls into the pool\\
398 - and she can't swim?\\
399 - Yeah?\\
400 - And suppose you jump in with your
clothes on\\
401 - and save her life?\\
402 - Well, you might got something there.\\
403 - Might got?\\
404 - It's absolutely inspired.
It's the greatest.\\
405 - You'll be the lead item\\
406 - in Hedda's column the very next day.\\
407 - We'll try it.
(door opening)\\
408 - Oh, hi, honey.
Oh, hello.\\
409 - Charlie, this is my wife.\\
410 - Lucy, Charlie Pomerantz.\\
411 - Nice to meet you.
How do you do, Mr. Pomerantz?\\
412 - It's very nice to meet you.\\
413 - I'm sorry I have to pop off like
this.\\
414 - Good-bye, dear.\\
415 - Good-bye, honey.\\
416 - Now, what we need is a good-looking,
young girl\\
417 - who could use some publicity.\\
418 - RICKY: Uh-huh.\\
419 - Yes?\\
420 - You wanted a young girl that...\\
421 - was good-looking?
Well, I'm...\\
422 - I'm...\\
423 - I want some publicity.\\
424 - Oh, no.\\
425 - No, no, no, you can't save your own
wife.\\
426 - Nobody would ever believe it.\\
427 - Yeah.\\
428 - Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.\\
429 - Hey, that might be a wonderful
gimmick,\\
430 - saving your own wife.\\
431 - Might be just daring enough to make
it.\\
432 - Oh, I don't know, Charlie.\\
433 - Oh, come on, Rick, let's give it a
try.\\
434 - Well, I...\\
435 - All right.\\
436 - Good! What do I do?\\
437 - Oh, it's easy.
All you do is\\
438 - fall in a pool with your clothes on.\\
439 - Well, I think I can... What?\\
440 - Look, Ricky is gonna be singing at
the tea.\\
441 - He'll jump in and save you.\\
442 - You will?\\
443 - Well, all right.
I'd like to do that.\\
444 - Besides, I told all my friends in New
York\\
445 - I was going to make a big splash in
Hollywood.\\
446 - (guffawing)\\
447 - Oh!\\
448 - Oh, my. You look lovely, dear.\\
449 - Thank you, Mother.\\
450 - You didn't have to get that dressed
up just for my company.\\
451 - Your what?\\
452 - My company, dear.\\
453 - That nice lady I met on the plane.\\
454 - I told you I invited her to tea this
afternoon.\\
455 - Oh, Mother. I'm sorry,\\
456 - but Ricky and I can't be here this
afternoon.\\
457 - Well! Well, this is a pretty kettle
of fish\\
458 - and I was only doing it for Mickey's
sake.\\
459 - Oh, well, I'm sorry, Mother,\\
460 - but Ricky made plans to sing at a tea\\
461 - down by the pool this afternoon and
I'm going to...\\
462 - Well, I... I have to be with him.\\
463 - I told you yesterday I'd invited her.\\
464 - Oh, dear.\\
465 - Well, come on, honey.\\
466 - We got to get downstairs.\\
467 - Well, if it isn't Mr. Ingrate!\\
468 - I wish that just once your Mother
would get my name right.\\
469 - Mother... Mother, couldn't you tell
the lady\\
470 - that we're busy and that we'll see
her another day?\\
471 - I certainly could not.\\
472 - What's the problem now?\\
473 - Oh, well, the lady that Mother met on
the plane\\
474 - is coming to tea this afternoon,\\
475 - and Mother is upset because we're not
going to be here.\\
476 - And I only invited her to meet you,
Mickey.\\
477 - She's in the newspaper business.\\
478 - What does she do, sell 'em?\\
479 - Oh, Ricky!\\
480 - Now, look, Mother, we appreciate your
trying to help,\\
481 - really we do, but there's just\\
482 - nothing we can do about this today.\\
483 - Oh, horsefeathers.\\
484 - Oh, dear. I'm afraid we hurt her
feelings.\\
485 - Well, honey, I'm sorry.\\
486 - Nothing we can do about it. Come on.
Let's go.\\
487 - Oh...\\
488 - (band playing Latin music)\\
489 - They call me Cuban Pete\\
490 - I'm the king of the rhumba beat\\
491 - When I play the maracas\\
492 - I go chick-chicky, boom,
chick-chicky, boom\\
493 - Yes, sir, I'm Cuban Pete\\
494 - I'm the craze on my native street\\
495 - When I start to dance\\
496 - Everything goes chick-chicky boom ,
chick-chicky, boom\\
497 - The senoritas, they sing\\
498 - How they swing with a sombrero is
very nice\\
499 - So full of spice\\
500 - And when they're dancing, they bring\\
501 - A happy ring of a vaquero\\
502 - Singing a song\\
503 - All the day long\\
504 - So, senoritas, please\\
505 - Take a lesson from Cuban Pete\\
506 - And I'll teach you to chick-chicky
boom\\
507 - Chick-chicky boom, chick-chicky boom\\
508 - Si, senorita, I know\\
509 - That you will like the
chicky-boom-chick\\
510 - 'Cause it's the dance\\
511 - Of Latin romance\\
512 - And Cuban Pete doesn't teach you in a
hurry\\
513 - Like Arthur Murray\\
514 - I come from Havana\\
515 - And there's always manana\\
516 - So, senorita, please\\
517 - Take it easy\\
518 - Do it with ease\\
519 - And you'll love it when you do the
chick\\
520 - The chicky-boom\\
521 - With Cuban Pete.\\
522 - (applause)\\
523 - Thanks.\\
524 - Thank you, thank you.\\
525 - Thank you, thank you.\\
526 - Where's Hedda Hooper?\\
527 - She'll be here.\\
528 - She'll be here.
Now relax.\\
529 - You know, Charlie, I'm not sure I'll
recognize Hedda.\\
530 - I've never seen her in person.\\
531 - You can't miss her. You just look for
the craziest hat\\
532 - you ever saw and Hedda will be
underneath it.\\
533 - (laughing): I've heard that about
her.\\
534 - Are you sure she's coming?\\
535 - Oh, now, keep cool.
Just trust old Charlie.\\
536 - She'll be here. Maybe you'd better
play\\
537 - another number, huh, Rick?\\
538 - LUCY: Play the one I like, doll.\\
539 - Okay.
Yes.\\
540 - (people chattering)\\
541 - (muted sax solo)\\
542 - Hey... hey, there she is!
There's Hedda!\\
543 - Go! Go! Come on!
Go! Go! Go ahead!\\
544 - Go! Go-go-go-go!\\
545 - Oh, no, wait!\\
546 - Be careful.\\
547 - Yes, sir.\\
548 - Thank you.\\
549 - Better stay away from the edge.\\
550 - Yeah, I will.\\
551 - I'm sorry, honey.
I-I-I thought it was her.\\
552 - It sure looked like her hat.\\
553 - Well, that's all right,\\
554 - but, uh, what are we gonna do about
him?\\
555 - If I jump in, he'll save me before I
hit the water.\\
556 - I'll take care of him.\\
557 - Hi! Uh, now, Burt...\\
558 - Oh, pardon me.\\
559 - I thought you were Burt Lancaster.\\
560 - Well, I've seen you someplace.\\
561 - You are in the movies, aren't you?\\
562 - No, but I'd sure like to be.\\
563 - Well, a guy with your build and
looks,\\
564 - shouldn't have any trouble.\\
565 - Say, you know, you're just great for
the lead\\
566 - in Esther Williams' new picture.\\
567 - I am?\\
568 - Yeah. You know, you don't happen\\
569 - to have a picture of yourself handy,
do you?\\
570 - Yeah, I got some right in my locker.\\
571 - I kind of figured you would have.\\
572 - Why don't you go get me one of those
pictures\\
573 - and I'll show it to some producers\\
574 - I know out at Metro, huh?\\
575 - Hey, thanks!\\
576 - Yeah, pick out a good one.\\
577 - Okay.
Take your time.\\
578 - Attaboy.\\
579 - (chuckling)\\
580 - You know, sometimes, my brain amazes
even me.\\
581 - (laughing): You sure got rid of him.\\
582 - Had to do it.\\
583 - Listen, are you sure she's coming?\\
584 - Now, will you please not worry about
it, Rick?\\
585 - I said she'd be here, she'd be here.\\
586 - Trust Charlie, will you?
She'll be here.\\
587 - BOBBY: Telephone for Mr. Ricardo.
Telephone for Mr.....\\
588 - Here, Bobby.\\
589 - Come in and take it in the lobby,
sir.\\
590 - Okay.\\
591 - Hurry it up, Rick, huh?\\
592 - Okay.\\
593 - You know, I just can't understand it.\\
594 - Hedda has made this function every
year\\
595 - for the last ten years.\\
596 - I know she's gonna be here.\\
597 - Well, she'll be here, Charlie.\\
598 - Wait a minute.
There she is.\\
599 - There's her hat!\\
600 - That's a hat?\\
601 - I know it's her favorite!\\
602 - I can't miss it. Now go ahead, go
ahead. Do your stuff.\\
603 - But Ricky isn't here!\\
604 - I'll go get him.
Don't you worry about a thing.\\
605 - But Charlie, Ricky...\\
606 - He'll be here in time.\\
607 - Now you just go-go-go-go on!
There we are.\\
608 - Help! Help!\\
609 - I'm drowning! Help!\\
610 - Help! I'm drowning!\\
611 - Help! Help! Help!\\
612 - Help, I'm drowning!\\
613 - Help! Help! I'm drowning!\\
614 - Help! Help!\\
615 - Somebody save me!\\
616 - Help, help!\\
617 - Help! Somebody save me!\\
618 - Help! Get away! Can't you see I'm
drowning?\\
619 - Help! Help, I'm...\\
620 - Help! Help, I'm drowning!\\
621 - I'll save you, honey!
Honey, I'll save you!\\
622 - I'll save you, honey!\\
623 - (screaming)\\
624 - Get away from me!\\
625 - Get off me!\\
626 - I got her!\\
627 - Say something to me, honey.\\
628 - Talk to me.\\
629 - Hello.\\
630 - She's all right.\\
631 - Kids, kids.\\
632 - It wasn't Hedda after all.\\
633 - What? What?\\
634 - It was just an old potted plant.\\
635 - What?!\\
636 - Lucy! Mickey! What happened?\\
637 - Well, we-we had an idea, but it
turned out to be all wet.\\
638 - Oh, dear. Well, anyway, you're in
time to meet my company.\\
639 - She's in seeing little Ricky.\\
640 - Oh!\\
641 - Mrs. McGillicuddy, what an adorable
child!\\
642 - He's almost cuter than my
granddaughter.\\
643 - Oh, thank you, dear.\\
644 - Uh, Lucy , Mickey,\\
645 - I'd like you to meet my good friend
Hedda Hopper.\\
646 - How do you...\\
647 - (gasping)\\
648 - Your mother's told me so much about
you two.\\
649 - You know, I do wish I could stay and
chat,\\
650 - but I was due at a party downstairs
an hour ago.\\
651 - Uh... is it raining outside?\\
652 - No?\\
653 - And they say I wear crazy hats.\\
654 - Well, thank you\\
655 - for everything, Mrs. McGillicuddy.\\
656 - MRS. McGILLICUDDY: Good-bye, Hedda.\\
657 - And it's nice meeting you.\\
658 - Mother, dear\\
659 - why didn't you tell us it was Hedda
Hooper?\\
660 - You didn't ask me.\\
661 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
662 - ANNOUNCER: Mrs. McGillicuddy was
played by Kathryn Card.\\
663 - Charlie Pomerantz was played by Hy
Averback.\\
664 - The bellboy was Bobby Jellison.\\
665 - The lifeguard was John Hart\\
666 - and Miss Hedda Hopper played herself.\\
667 - I Love Lucy is a Desilu Production.\\
668 - Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz\\
669 - will be back next week at this same
time.\\
670 - Hi. We came back to tell you
something.\\
671 - Something that's important to all of
us.\\
672 - It's about the Olympic Games.\\
673 - They're going to be held next year in
Melbourne, Australia,\\
674 - and our team must be there to win.\\
675 - It's up to us, to every American,\\
676 - who wants to see the Stars and
Stripes\\
677 - flying above the victor stands,\\
678 - to see the funds available.\\
679 - You see, the teams behind the iron
and bamboo curtains\\
680 - are government-subsidized,\\
681 - but our team is really our team,
yours and mine.\\
682 - It's only gonna be there\\
683 - if we prove that we want it there
with our contributions.\\
684 - You want to know something?\\
685 - The Pan-American games in Mexico City
are on right now,\\
686 - and because we didn't raise enough

689 - All right, all right.\\

\subsection {Episode 22: Don Juan is Shelved}
1 - ("I love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Poor little guy.\\
3 - He was asleep before I got his
pajamas on.\\
4 - That was some walk you took him on.\\
5 - I took him on?
He took me on.\\
6 - (laughing)\\
7 - Aw, I never was so tired in my life.\\
8 - What's that you're reading, Mother--
Variety?\\
9 - Bought it in the lobby.
It's very interesting.\\
10 - Oh, come now, I bet you don't
understand a word it says.\\
11 - Well, there's one item I do
understand in here.\\
12 - Oh?\\
13 - I didn't think Mickey\\
14 - had made his picture yet.\\
15 - He hasn't, and his name isn't Mickey.\\
16 - Well, whatever his name is, they got
it wrong in here.\\
17 - They say that the picture's all
finished\\
18 - and it's been put in storage.\\
19 - What? Where does it say that?\\
20 - Says right here.\\
21 - "Metro shelves Don Juan."\\
22 - Oh, no!\\
23 - You mean he didn't even tell you he
made the picture?\\
24 - Oh, no, Mother, you don't understand.\\
25 - They haven't made the picture\\
26 - and "shelved" means they're not going
to.\\
27 - Lucy... Luc...\\
28 - I saw it.\\
29 - How's Ricky taking it?\\
30 - He hasn't seen it yet.\\
31 - He's still in the shower.\\
32 - Oh, what do you suppose happened?\\
33 - Oh, gosh, this is awful.\\
34 - He hasn't even started yet and
already he's a has-been.\\
35 - He isn't even a has-been, he's a
never-was.\\
36 - California, here we go.\\
37 - We might as well start packing.\\
38 - I just got out here.\\
39 - Now I have to go back home without
seeing anything.\\
40 - Oh, I haven't even seen Palm Springs.\\
41 - I can beat that.\\
42 - Well, will you listen to us.\\
43 - What do you mean?\\
44 - Here we are complaining,\\
45 - thinking only about ourselves,\\
46 - and Ricky's whole career is ruined.\\
47 - Oh, she's right.\\
48 - Lucy, I'm so ashamed.\\
49 - I was only thinking of myself.\\
50 - I was only thinking of myself.\\
51 - And I was only thinking of Lana
Turner.\\
52 - Oh, Fred!\\
53 - Lucy, how are we gonna break this to
him?\\
54 - We just won't tell him.\\
55 - Give me that.\\
56 - ETHEL: What are you gonna do?\\
57 - Oh, Lucy!\\
58 - That won't do any good; he'll see it
anyway.\\
59 - Oh, even if he doesn't, the studio
will tell him\\
60 - the picture's been shelved.\\
61 - Well, we have to cushion the blow
somehow.\\
62 - RICKY: Lucy?\\
63 - Yes, dear?\\
64 - Uh, uh, yes, dear?\\
65 - Where's my blue tie?\\
66 - Oh, it's uh... it's o...\\
67 - Yeah, yeah, never mind, I got it, I
found it.\\
68 - Now, listen, when he comes out here,
act like nothing happened.\\
69 - Just be natural and leave everything
to me.\\
70 - What are you gonna do?\\
71 - Well, I'll, I'll, I'll probably bring
the conversation around\\
72 - to how homesick we all are\\
73 - and how we don't care much about
Hollywood anyway, you know.\\
74 - Yeah, that's a good idea.\\
75 - Whatever you do, don't let the cat
out of the bag.\\
76 - Oh, don't worry.\\
77 - As far as he's concerned,\\
78 - we never even saw that item in
Variety.\\
79 - And for heaven's sake, smile.\\
80 - Look happy or he'll know that
something's wrong.\\
81 - Oh, hi, everybody.\\
82 - Hello, dear.\\
83 - Hi, Ricky.\\
84 - How are you?\\
85 - Hi, Rick, old boy.\\
86 - How's tricks? How's tricks?\\
87 - Hello, son.\\
88 - My, you're certainly all happy this
morning.\\
89 - Sure.\\
90 - Well, there's nothing to be sad
about.\\
91 - No. We didn't even see that item in
Variety.\\
92 - What item?\\
93 - Oh, it's nothing, dear.
It was just a mention.\\
94 - It didn't say a thing about the
picture being shelved. Oh!\\
95 - That cat wasn't let out of the bag.\\
96 - It was yanked out.\\
97 - What are you talking about?\\
98 - Oh, honey, it was just a little item
in Variety\\
99 - about your picture being shelved,\\
100 - but it doesn't matter.\\
101 - Who wants to be in pictures anyway?
Feh!\\
102 - Is that what you're worried about?\\
103 - Just one little item in the paper?\\
104 - Uh-huh.
Well, honey,\\
105 - that's just publicity.\\
106 - Sure, you know, they want the people\\
107 - to keep talking about the picture.\\
108 - They'll do anything out here to keep
a picture alive.\\
109 - Even kill it?\\
110 - (chuckling)\\
111 - Sure. Look, if we weren't gonna make
the picture,\\
112 - don't you think I'd be the first one
to know?\\
113 - Well, yeah, I suppose so.\\
114 - Of course, honey.
This afternoon\\
115 - I'm going to the studio to make some
tests\\
116 - with the leading lady.	     Oh?\\
117 - Now, they wouldn't be making tests\\
118 - if they were gonna cancel the
picture.\\
119 - No, I guess not.\\
120 - Of course not.\\
121 - Oh, boy, am I relieved!\\
122 - Oh, thank goodness, my trip isn't
ruined.\\
123 - And I'll get to see Palm Springs
after all.\\
124 - LUCY: Yeah.
Dry those tears, Lana.\\
125 - (phone ringing)\\
126 - You should have asked me, then you
wouldn't have been worried.\\
127 - Oh, boy.\\
128 - Hello?\\
129 - Yes, this is Ricky Ricardo.\\
130 - What?\\
131 - They are?\\
132 - Do you know why?\\
133 - You don't? I see.\\
134 - Yes, I'll be here.\\
135 - Thank you for calling.\\
136 - What's the matter, dear?\\
137 - Who was that?\\
138 - The studio.\\
139 - They're canceling the test this
afternoon.\\
140 - Well... but why?\\
141 - They didn't say why.\\
142 - Oh, well, honey, that doesn't mean
anything.\\
143 - Of course not.\\
144 - It's just publicity.	Sure.\\
145 - Yeah.\\
146 - They also said that Dore Schary\\
147 - wants to see me here tomorrow
afternoon.\\
148 - I've heard that name before.\\
149 - Now, who's Dore Schary?\\
150 - Well, that's good, isn't it, honey?\\
151 - His wanting to see you here?\\
152 - No, that's bad.\\
153 - Who's Dore Schary?\\
154 - Oh, he's... he's someone at Metro,
dear.\\
155 - Well, what does he do at Metro?\\
156 - Oh, he's a big shot.\\
157 - Well, just what does he do?\\
158 - Oh, he's the guy that twists the
lion's tail\\
159 - when they want him to...\\
160 - (roaring)\\
161 - Oh, Fred!\\
162 - Well, honey...
honey, why is it bad?\\
163 - I don't understand.\\
164 - Well, don't you see, honey?\\
165 - When a big man like Mr. Schary's
gonna come all the way out here,\\
166 - it must be just to make it nice while
he's firing me.\\
167 - Oh, dear.\\
168 - I guess he's right.\\
169 - Well, honey, don't you care.\\
170 - At least we got a trip to California
out of it.\\
171 - Short as it was.\\
172 - Oh, Mother, please.\\
173 - Oh, I can't stand it anymore.\\
174 - I got to walk to the studio, find out
what it's all about.\\
175 - Oh, well, you're right, dear.\\
176 - You demand to know.\\
177 - You're hardworking...
all of a sudden they cancel.\\
178 - Yeah, I know, honey.\\
179 - I don't understand.\\
180 - Well, you have a right to know, dear.\\
181 - Oh, I could cry.\\
182 - He looked so disappointed.\\
183 - Poor Mickey.\\
184 - Aw, poor Ricky.\\
185 - If he just made one picture, I know
that the women of America\\
186 - would have gone absolutely mad about
his big, brown eyes.\\
187 - Yeah. That fan mail would have
flooded the studio.\\
188 - Well, there's no use dreaming.\\
189 - That's it!\\
190 - Fan mail.\\
191 - Fan mail?\\
192 - Yeah. What do you think if all that
flood of fan mail\\
193 - reached the studio by tomorrow
morning?\\
194 - I'll bet Dore Schary would think
twice about letting him go\\
195 - if the people of America were just
demanding\\
196 - to see more of Ricky Ricardo.\\
197 - More of him? He hasn't even been on
the screen yet.\\
198 - Who's gonna write him a fan letter?\\
199 - You got it.\\
200 - Lucy?\\
201 - Listen, everybody, the next hundred
letters we write\\
202 - ask for Ricky's picture,\\
203 - and don't forget to change your
handwriting.\\
204 - Yeah, Fred, be sure and change your
handwriting\\
205 - or they'll think they're all from the
same person.\\
206 - I did change my handwriting.\\
207 - Look...\\
208 - I wrote the last hundred with my
left.\\
209 - Your left what? Foot?\\
210 - They'll think a chicken wants his
autograph.\\
211 - Oh, come on, cut the gab.\\
212 - You're holding up the production
line.\\
213 - Well, I'm going as fast as I can,\\
214 - but my hand's getting a cramp.\\
215 - Mine, too.\\
216 - Oh, for heaven's sake,\\
217 - we've only written 500 letters.\\
218 - Your hands can't be that cramped.\\
219 - Tell that to my hand.\\
220 - Oh, Ethel, you sure are a sissy.\\
221 - Well, haven't you got writer's cramp?\\
222 - No.\\
223 - Let me see your hand.\\
224 - Put down your pen.\\
225 - Now wiggle your fingers.\\
226 - Having a little trouble?\\
227 - Well, after all we have written 500
letters.\\
228 - How about a little breather?\\
229 - Okay.\\
230 - Say,		(sighing)\\
231 - why don't I take all these downstairs
and mail them.\\
232 - Oh, that's a good idea, Mother.\\
233 - Oh, Lucy, my whole shoulder's sore.\\
234 - Me, too.
I feel like\\
235 - I just pitched three games in the
World Series.\\
236 - Well, now, remember, we're doing this
for Ricky's sake.\\
237 - You think 500 letters will do any
good?\\
238 - No, but 5,000 will.\\
239 - Oh, Lucy, I don't think I can make
it.\\
240 - Now, don't forget, Ethel,\\
241 - if Ricky doesn't get into the movies,\\
242 - you don't get to stay in California.\\
243 - What's the good of staying in
California,\\
244 - if I have to go around with my arm in
a sling?\\
245 - (phone ringing)\\
246 - Hello.\\
247 - He is?\\
248 - Did he see you, Mother?\\
249 - Okay, thanks.\\
250 - Ricky's on his way up from the lobby.\\
251 - Get rid of all the stuff.\\
252 - Oh, hide everything, Fred.\\
253 - Hide everything now.\\
254 - Ethel, hand me that ink well.\\
255 - Hurry up.\\
256 - (screaming): Oh!\\
257 - Fred, I'm sorry!\\
258 - What's the matter?\\
259 - Look, I slammed the drawer on your
hand.\\
260 - Oh, how do you like that?\\
261 - It's so numb, I didn't even feel it.\\
262 - Oh, Fred...
I'm sorry.\\
263 - Oh...
You all right?\\
264 - Gee, I'm sorry, Fred.\\
265 - Take a magazine.\\
266 - Just sit back and read it.\\
267 - LUCY: Oh, hi, dear.\\
268 - FRED AND ETHEL: Hi, Rick.\\
269 - Bueno, parece que ya se acabo todo.\\
270 - Oh, really?\\
271 - How were things at the studio, Rick?\\
272 - Did they shelve the picture?\\
273 - Yeah, they sure did.\\
274 - Oh...\\
275 - They can't do that to you.\\
276 - Well, they just did it.\\
277 - There's no doubt about it.\\
278 - Metro just gave me the door in the
fence.\\
279 - What's that?\\
280 - Well, you ought to know, it's an
American 'spression.\\
281 - Are you sure that's an American
'spression?\\
282 - Yeah. They gave me the door in the
fence.\\
283 - Oh, they gave you the gate!\\
284 - That's what I said.\\
285 - I'm washed up. Finished.\\
286 - Did you see Mr. Schary today?\\
287 - No, but they're shoveling the
picture.\\
288 - What if they do shovel it?\\
289 - Maybe they'll put you in another one.\\
290 - Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah.\\
291 - Maybe they're gonna use me\\
292 - in one of the Marx Brothers'
pictures,\\
293 - you know, Chico, Harpo, Groucho, and
Floppo.\\
294 - Aw, honey, now, don't you worry.\\
295 - I have a feeling that the public will
make itself heard.\\
296 - What public?\\
297 - Yeah, well...\\
298 - Maybe I could borrow a couple hundred\\
299 - bobby-soxers from Sinatra.\\
300 - (mouthing words)\\
301 - (mouthing words)\\
302 - (no audio)\\
303 - This is Ricky Ricardo.\\
304 - Are you sure you haven't got any
calls for me\\
305 - from Mr. Dore Schary?\\
306 - Oh, I can't understand it.\\
307 - He was supposed to be in here half an
hour ago.\\
308 - All right, thank you.\\
309 - (phone ringing)\\
310 - Hello?\\
311 - What?\\
312 - Who's on his way up?\\
313 - The Ricky Ricardo Fan Club?\\
314 - All right.\\
315 - (knock on door)\\
316 - Come in.\\
317 - There he is!\\
318 - That's Ricky Ricardo!\\
319 - (clamoring)\\
320 - Let me have your autograph, please.\\
321 - Come on, Rick!\\
322 - Got it!\\
323 - Yeah, that's great.\\
324 - Where's Dore Schary?\\
325 - Now, what do you think you're doing?\\
326 - Where's Dore Schary?\\
327 - He's not here yet.\\
328 - All right, back in the hall.\\
329 - Make another entrance.\\
330 - Now, just a minute, just a minute.\\
331 - Hold it, everybody.\\
332 - Nobody's gonna make another entrance
anywhere.\\
333 - Well, don't you want us to help you?\\
334 - No!\\
335 - Good. I was gonna feel pretty silly
telling him\\
336 - I slept with your picture under my
pillow!\\
337 - (mirthless chuckle)\\
338 - No.\\
339 - Well, we only wanted to help you.\\
340 - Well, then get out of here.\\
341 - Oh, that's gratitude for you.\\
342 - Yeah.\\
343 - Give me Texas 0-3311, please.\\
344 - (soft chuckle)\\
345 - Mr. Schary's office.\\
346 - (phone ringing)\\
347 - Mr. Schary's office.\\
348 - Now, Miss Ballantine, this is Ricky
Ricardo calling.\\
349 - Oh, yes.\\
350 - Look, have I got my dates mixed up or
something?\\
351 - Am I not supposed to have\\
352 - an appointment with Mr. Schary today?\\
353 - Why, yes. Isn't he there yet?\\
354 - No.\\
355 - Oh, he's probably still tied up\\
356 - at the Producer's Association meeting
at the hotel.\\
357 - That's why he was gonna meet you
there.\\
358 - Oh.\\
359 - And he said he'd be back here by
4:00.\\
360 - He has a very important appointment
with Mr. Stevens.\\
361 - Well, that's 25 minutes from now.\\
362 - Well, in that case, perhaps\\
363 - you'd better come out to the studio.\\
364 - Then you'll be sure to see him.\\
365 - Okay, I'll, I'll be right there.
Good-bye.\\
366 - You can have your fan club meeting
here.\\
367 - I'm going to the studio.\\
368 - (giggling): Where...\\
369 - Oh, no!\\
370 - Where is Mickey Ricardo?\\
371 - Oh, brother!\\
372 - Hello. This is Dore Schary.\\
373 - May I have my office, please?\\
374 - Mr. Schary's office.\\
375 - Miss Ballantine, I won't be back at
the studio this afternoon.\\
376 - But what about your appointment with
Mr. Stevens?\\
377 - Oh, Mr. Stevens' is at the lunch\\
378 - and then we're having our meeting
here\\
379 - and then I'm going to drop in on
Ricky Ricardo.\\
380 - But Mr. Ricardo's on his way to the
studio.\\
381 - Well, uh, will you call him back,
please,\\
382 - and see if he's left yet?\\
383 - Yes, sir.\\
384 - Let me know.
I'm down by the pool.\\
385 - All right.\\
386 - Thank you. Good-bye.\\
387 - (playing chords)\\
388 - (playing chords)\\
389 - I still say we should go right out
there\\
390 - and bust into Dore Schary's office.\\
391 - They wouldn't even let us through the
gate.\\
392 - Oh...
(phone ringing)\\
393 - Hello?\\
394 - This is Mr. Schary's secretary.\\
395 - Has Mr. Ricardo left yet?\\
396 - Oh, yes, he has.\\
397 - Oh, dear. Do you suppose you could
possibly catch him?\\
398 - Mr. Schary still wants to meet him at
the hotel.\\
399 - Oh, yes, I can catch him.
I'll call the garage.\\
400 - What's up?\\
401 - Dore Schary's coming here after all.\\
402 - I have to catch Ricky.\\
403 - Oh, no, I don't.\\
404 - Oh, Lucy, hurry up.\\
405 - He'll be gone in a minute.\\
406 - Yeah.\\
407 - What now, blue eyes?\\
408 - You know, maybe it's better\\
409 - if Ricky doesn't talk to Dore Schary
right now.\\
410 - In his frame of mind,\\
411 - he'd probably say the wrong thing
anyway.\\
412 - So?\\
413 - So, we can approach it\\
414 - from an entirely different angle.\\
415 - ETHEL: How?\\
416 - Suppose when Mr. Schary arrives,\\
417 - there's another big producer here\\
418 - just dying to get Ricky under
contract.\\
419 - Yeah.
Yeah.\\
420 - Now, where do we find somebody that
looks\\
421 - like a big, important producer?\\
422 - Oh, that's a tough one.\\
423 - Somebody who looks\\
424 - like a real important producer.\\
425 - (sputtering)\\
426 - Well, don't just stand there, Fred.\\
427 - Try to think of somebody.\\
428 - Well!\\
429 - Hey, the lobby's always full of
actors\\
430 - and there're always a lot of them
around the pool.\\
431 - Suppose we find one and pay him to do
the job?\\
432 - Great!
Now wait a minute.\\
433 - I doubt if they'd take you seriously
in that getup.\\
434 - Oh, that's right. Change and meet me
back here right away.\\
435 - All right.\\
436 - Well, this meeting has been very
helpful, Dore.\\
437 - I'll get back to you in a day or two.\\
438 - Thank you, Jim.
Good talking to you.\\
439 - Can I drop you at the studio?\\
440 - No, thanks.
I have another engagement here.\\
441 - Fine. I'll see you.\\
442 - Bye.\\
443 - Would you ring the Ricky Ricardo
suite for me, please?\\
444 - Oh, honestly, you'd think there'd be
one actor\\
445 - in that lobby up there today,
wouldn't you?\\
446 - There's always about two dozen
hanging around.\\
447 - Boy, it's pretty discouraging.\\
448 - Well, there's none down here either.\\
449 - (sighing)\\
450 - (whispering): Lucy?\\
451 - What?\\
452 - What about him?\\
453 - Nah.\\
454 - Beggars can't be choosers.\\
455 - Would you ring that again, please.\\
456 - BOBBY: Hi, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
457 - Hi, Bobby.
Oh, hi, Bobby.\\
458 - Hey, Bobby, maybe you can help us.\\
459 - Sure. What can I do for you?\\
460 - Well, listen, Ricky's picture was
shelved.\\
461 - Yeah, I know.
I saw it in Variety.\\
462 - Yeah, well, Mr. Dore Schary is coming
up to our apartment\\
463 - in a few minutes to have a little
talk with Ricky.\\
464 - Can I bring you up some ice water?\\
465 - I've never even seen Dore Schary.\\
466 - No, I'm afraid not, Bobby.\\
467 - There's gonna be too much going on.\\
468 - Now, look, I have a plan.\\
469 - I thought if we had another big
producer there\\
470 - that was just dying to put Ricky
under contract,\\
471 - then Mr. Schary wouldn't fire Ricky,
see?\\
472 - BOBBY: You know, you're right.\\
473 - These big producers always want you\\
474 - when somebody else wants you.\\
475 - Mm.	What a bunch of eggheads.\\
476 - LUCY: Yeah.\\
477 - You can say that again.     Yeah.\\
478 - Well, you know where we can find an
actor\\
479 - real quick that could play the
producer?\\
480 - We'll pay $10.\\
481 - Producer, huh?
Uh-huh.\\
482 - (clears throat)\\
483 - (pseudo British accent): Now, see
here, Dore,\\
484 - I simply must have Ricardo for my
next picture.\\
485 - Oh, no, Bobby, I'm afraid you're not
the type.\\
486 - I got shoes that make me four inches
higher.\\
487 - Four inches higher?\\
488 - How do you look?\\
489 - I look all right, but my ears pop.\\
490 - Oh, Bobby.\\
491 - LUCY: Thanks, anyway.\\
492 - Be sure and tell me if you see\\
493 - any producer-type actors around, huh?\\
494 - BOBBY: Yes, ma'am.\\
495 - Gee, we gotta find somebody and soon.
Come on.\\
496 - Uh, pardon me.\\
497 - I couldn't help overhearing.\\
498 - Are you looking for an actor?\\
499 - Well, yes, I am.\\
500 - Well, I'm an actor.\\
501 - Well, I'm afraid you won't do.\\
502 - You see, we're looking for someone\\
503 - who looks like a producer.\\
504 - I've, uh... I've been told that I
look like a producer.\\
505 - You?\\
506 - (dismissive chuckle)\\
507 - The bellboy looks more like a
producer than you do.\\
508 - Now, Lucy, there's not much time\\
509 - and he is willing.\\
510 - Oh, I'm willing.\\
511 - Besides, I could use the ten bucks.\\
512 - Well, you're not exactly the type
we're looking for.\\
513 - Um, would you do it for $7.50?\\
514 - All right, it's a deal.\\
515 - Okay, come on.\\
516 - I don't usually work this cheap,\\
517 - but things are tough, what with
television and all.\\
518 - Yeah, I know, I know.\\
519 - Ethel?\\
520 - Oh, Lucy?\\
521 - Lucy.\\
522 - Well, Fred, we found one down by the
pool.\\
523 - Is that the best you could do?\\
524 - Well, we didn't have much choice.\\
525 - It was either him or the bellboy.\\
526 - He doesn't look like a producer.\\
527 - He's dressed all wrong.\\
528 - What's the matter with my clothes?\\
529 - Well, you just don't look like a
producer.\\
530 - You look like a banker or a
businessman or something.\\
531 - Yeah, a real square.\\
532 - FRED: Yeah.\\
533 - Hey, maybe I got something in my
closet\\
534 - that'll sharpen him up a little.\\
535 - Hey, Fred, go get your sport coat.\\
536 - Right.\\
537 - Uh, now, listen, uh...
uh, what's your name?\\
538 - Uh, Spelvin.
George Spelvin.\\
539 - Oh, well, listen, George.\\
540 - Here's the situation.\\
541 - Now, my husband Ricky Ricardo is
under contract to MGM.\\
542 - Was.\\
543 - Now, Ethel, we don't know.\\
544 - And Dore Schary is a big shot at MGM.\\
545 - Yes, I've heard of him.\\
546 - Yeah. Well, he's due here in a few
minutes\\
547 - and we think he's going to fire
Ricky.\\
548 - Now, we want you to pretend\\
549 - that you're a big producer from
another studio\\
550 - and offer Ricky a contract.\\
551 - Well, do you think, uh,\\
552 - do you think Schary will go for a gag
like that?\\
553 - Well, why shouldn't he?\\
554 - Well, I hear he's pretty bright.\\
555 - Bright?\\
556 - If he's letting Ricky go, he's pretty
stupid.\\
557 - Yeah.\\
558 - Oh.\\
559 - Well, uh, wouldn't he know all the
other big producers in town?\\
560 - (gasps)\\
561 - Gee, that's right.\\
562 - Well, now, maybe he'd better be a
producer from back East\\
563 - or from Europe.\\
564 - A foreign producer.\\
565 - Can you do an accent?\\
566 - Not for $7.50.\\
567 - Well, let me hear your accent.\\
568 - I might go to ten dollars.\\
569 - (with Swedish accent): I just come
here from Sweden.\\
570 - I want to talk to Ricky Ricardo\\
571 - about making a picture for me in
Sweden.\\
572 - Back to $7.50.\\
573 - Well, I thought that was pretty good.\\
574 - Here's just the thing you need.\\
575 - Okay.\\
576 - Take off your coat, George.\\
577 - Oh, this is great.\\
578 - Okay.\\
579 - Put this on now.\\
580 - FRED: Now.\\
581 - There. Now he looks like a producer.\\
582 - FRED: Yeah.\\
583 - Yeah, that's more like it.\\
584 - Now... now, try to look important.\\
585 - Stand up straight.\\
586 - Hold in your stomach.\\
587 - I think he's the type that should be
sitting down.\\
588 - Sit down.\\
589 - Now, get comfortable.\\
590 - Cross your legs.\\
591 - Now, try to say something in a real
cultured tone of voice.\\
592 - Say, um...\\
593 - (with deep voice): Now, look here,
Dore.\\
594 - I want that very talented Ricky
Ricardo\\
595 - in a big musical I'm making.\\
596 - Now, look here, Dore.\\
597 - Ah, way down here.
Way down here.\\
598 - Now, look here, Dore.\\
599 - Now, look here, Dore.\\
600 - I want that talented Ricky Ricardo\\
601 - for a musical...\\
602 - A big musical.\\
603 - A big musical I'm making.\\
604 - And money is no object.\\
605 - And m... and m...\\
606 - and I just can't bring myself to say
that.\\
607 - Listen, do you want the job or not?\\
608 - Well...\\
609 - Then say money is no object.\\
610 - And money is no object.\\
611 - What's the matter?\\
612 - It leaves a bad taste in your mouth,
doesn't it?\\
613 - Hi, everybody.\\
614 - Oh, hi, dear... Oh!\\
615 - Hi, dear.\\
616 - Uh... wel...
Hi, honey.\\
617 - RICKY: I'm sorry I'm late.
I went to the studio.\\
618 - Well, uh, do you two people know each
other?\\
619 - Of course we know each other.\\
620 - Who do you think I had an appointment
with?\\
621 - Dore Schary.\\
622 - Well?\\
623 - Well?\\
624 - Who... who...
who... who...\\
625 - Who... who...
who....\\
626 - What's the matter?
You sound like an owl.\\
627 - Who... who is he?\\
628 - Mr. Dore Schary.\\
629 - Uh, so long, Ricky.\\
630 - Nice being married to you.\\
631 - Wait a minute.\\
632 - What's the matter with you?\\
633 - Well, nothing yet.\\

Ricky.\\

chatting.\\
636 - We have?\\
637 - Oh, yeah, yeah.\\
638 - We have.\\
639 - Oh, yeah.\\
640 - Mr. Schary's quite a chatterer.\\
641 - Yeah.\\
642 - Yeah, and-and he's so bright and
intelligent and charming.\\
643 - Thank you, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
644 - Ricky, I came over here to tell you\\
645 - about that item in the paper.\\
646 - Oh, yes.\\
647 - It's true we are shelving Don Juan.\\
648 - Too many production problems.\\
649 - (muttering): Oh...\\
650 - But we're going to pick up your
option\\
651 - and we're going to put you in another
picture\\
652 - just as soon as we can find the right
one.\\
653 - (cheering)\\
654 - Oh, boy!\\
655 - Oh, boy!\\
656 - Well, thank you.\\
657 - Thank you for having so much
confidence in me.\\
658 - We have, Ricky. I just wanted to tell

669 - Good-bye, sir.\\
670 - Thanks a lot.\\
671 - Oh...\\

673 - How about that?
Isn't that great?\\
674 - Hey, I owe you an apology.\\
675 - What about?\\
676 - About your-your taste in clothes.\\
677 - Mr. Schary's wearing a sport coat
just like yours.\\
678 - Yeah.\\
679 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
680 - Oh, Ricky, I'm so happy for you.\\
681 - Say, I'll bet that fan mail had a lot
to do with it.\\
682 - What fan mail?\\
683 - Oh, wait till you find out what we
did for you, boy.\\
684 - Yeah, what?\\
685 - (knock at door)
Yeah, well...\\
686 - Hi, Bobby.\\
687 - Hi. Say, Mrs. Ricardo,\\

10 - Article, pictures, the works.\\
11 - Wow, wonderful. What did you want to
talk to me about?\\
12 - Well, about the article.\\
13 - You're a very important part of it.\\
14 - I am?
Sure.\\
15 - You see, now that Don Juan is called
off,\\
16 - we can play up the fact that Ricky is
married,\\
17 - and the article is going to be
entitled "What it's like\\
18 - to be married to Ricky Ricardo," by
you.\\
19 - By me?
That's right.\\
20 - "What it's like to be married to
Ricky Ricardo."\\
21 - You think you can handle it?\\
22 - Handle it? I'm an expert in the
field.\\
23 - Good.\\
24 - Hi.\\
25 - LUCY: There he is.\\
26 - Hi, Ross. Hi, honey.\\
27 - Hi, Ricky.
You've been waiting for me?\\
28 - No. I came over to see Lucy.	   
Oh.\\
29 - We were just discussing an article
about you\\
30 - for Photoplay magazine.\\
31 - You and Lucy were discussing it?\\
32 - Yeah, it's called\\
33 - "What it's like to be married to
Ricky Ricardo"\\
34 - by me.\\
35 - Oh, oh, I see.\\
36 - You gonna write it and then you gonna
put Lucy's name...\\
37 - No, no, Ricky. We want this to be an
honest, sincere account\\
38 - of exactly the way Lucy feels about
you.\\
39 - What's the matter with you?\\
40 - You crazy or something?\\
41 - What are you afraid of, Ricky?\\
42 - Haven't got enough "'sperience."\\
43 - I've been married to you longer than
anybody.\\
44 - I don't mean that.
I mean you...\\
45 - you haven't got enough 'sperience in
writing.\\
46 - She doesn't need any, Ricky.\\
47 - They gave me a list of questions.\\
48 - All they want Lucy to do is fill in
the answers.\\
49 - See?\\
50 - Well, uh, I guess it's all right.\\
51 - Well, fine. Here are the questions,
Lucy,\\
52 - and send the answers to that address,
huh?\\
53 - Okay. I'll do it right away.\\
54 - Well, I'd better be going.\\
55 - I'm setting up a big television show
for you, Ricky.\\
56 - Good!
I'll see you later.\\
57 - All right.	Oh, and Lucy,\\
58 - Yeah.
Don't be afraid of it.\\
59 - Put it down in your own words. Be
natural.\\
60 - LUCY: I will. Okay.\\
61 - Good-bye, Ross.\\
62 - Bye.
All right, thank you.\\
63 - Well, what kind of questions are
they?\\
64 - Well, let's see now.\\
65 - Question number one: "are you happily
married?"\\
66 - Question number two: "Does Ricky
snore?"\\
67 - Question number three:\\
68 - "What kind of husbands do Latins
really make?"\\
69 - (chuckling): Oh, this is gonna be
fun.\\
70 - Yeah, yeah.\\
71 - Ha, ha, ha.\\
72 - Uh... listen, uh,\\
73 - you, y-you sure you don't want me to
help you\\
74 - with the answers?\\
75 - No, no, no.\\
76 - Now, I have to do this all by myself.\\
77 - Now, you go away and leave me alone.\\
78 - Go over there and sit down on the
chair\\
79 - and read your paper.\\
80 - Yeah, well.
Just leave me be.\\
81 - (sighing)\\
82 - Let's see now, first question.\\
83 - "Are... you...
happily married?"\\
84 - Had you worried for a minute there,
didn't I?\\
85 - Yeah.\\
86 - Question number two: "Does Ricky
snore?"\\
87 - What's that, all that other stuff
you're writing there now?\\
88 - I'm just answering the question about
snoring.\\
89 - Yeah, but weren't the first two
letters, "n-o"?\\
90 - They were "o-h."\\
91 - "O-h"?\\
92 - And the second word was
"b-r-o-t-h-e-r."\\
93 - B-r-o-t-h...\\
94 - What's all that other stuff you're
writing there now?\\
95 - Just a few descriptive passages.\\
96 - (snorting)\\
97 - (sputtering)\\
98 - (sputtering)\\
99 - (gasping and wheezing)\\
100 - (whistling)\\
101 - (whistling)\\
102 - (chattering)\\
103 - (jabbering)\\
104 - Now, just a minute.
Just a minute.\\
105 - I want to see, I want to see what
you're writing.\\
106 - No, no, no! Now just go away.
You can't see this.\\
107 - Go back and sit down in your chair
and leave me alone.\\
108 - Oh, all right. I'll go in the other
room.\\
109 - All right.\\
110 - Let's see now,\\
111 - "What kind of husbands do Latins
really make?"\\
112 - (door slamming)\\
113 - How'd you know I was here?\\
114 - I heard you breathing.\\
115 - Now, go on back.
Go on, get out of here!\\
116 - Now, I got a right to know what
you're writing there.\\
117 - You have no right to see this\\
118 - until it comes out in the magazine.\\
119 - Now I mean it. Now go away and leave
me alone!\\
120 - RICKY: I got a right to know what
you're hiding.\\
121 - LUCY: You have no right to see it\\
122 - and I'm supposed to do the...\\
123 - Come back here, you two!
I'm supposed to do...\\
124 - You go on and get out of here.\\
125 - ETHEL: Hey, what's going on?\\
126 - I'm supposed to write an article
about Ricky\\
127 - all by myself and he won't let me
alone.\\
128 - An article?\\
129 - Yeah, it's for Photoplay magazine.\\
130 - It's called "What it's like to be
married to Ricky Ricardo"\\
131 - and I have a lot of questions I have
to answer.\\
132 - Oh, boy, what an opportunity.\\
133 - I wish I'd get a chance to write an
article like that.\\
134 - Aah, who'd buy it-- True Horror
Stories?\\
135 - Oh, you funny, funny woman.\\
136 - All right, everybody,\\
137 - I cannot create with a crowd around.\\
138 - Now, look, Lucy, you listen to me...\\
139 - Look, Ricky, I'll make a deal with
you.\\
140 - If you'll go away and let me answer
these questions,\\
141 - I promise I'll let you see them
before I send them in.\\
142 - You promise?
I promise.\\
143 - Come on, Ricky.
We'll take you\\
144 - down to Will Wright's and buy you an
ice cream soda.\\
145 - Now, Ethel, we're not going there
again today.\\
146 - Yes, we are now, Fred.\\
147 - They've got 24 flavors, and I've only
tasted 20.\\
148 - Come on, Rick.\\
149 - I'll need you to help me push her
through the door.\\
150 - Take your time, everybody.\\
151 - I want to do a good job on my first
big assignment.\\
152 - Yeah, well, but just watch what, you
know...\\
153 - Never mind now.\\
154 - (phone ringing)\\
155 - Hello.\\
156 - Oh, no, Ross. He just left.\\
157 - You did?\\
158 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
159 - Wait a minute now.
I'll write it down.\\
160 - "TV, Coast To Coast.\\
161 - Ricky's gonna emcee the Heart Fund."\\
162 - Oh, gee, Ross, that's wonderful.\\
163 - Say, I don't suppose they might need\\
164 - a pretty girl to lead the guest stars
up to the microphone, huh?\\
165 - Yeah, well, I happen to know a
redhead who...\\
166 - Oh, they have.\\
167 - Oh, well, okay.\\
168 - Uh, say, Ross...\\
169 - (laughing giddily)\\
170 - I, uh, I just happened to have a
thought.\\
171 - Ross, instead of my writing that
article for the magazine,\\
172 - how about you getting someone to
interview me\\
173 - and ask those questions about Ricky
on that program?\\
174 - And that way, people all over America
could...\\
175 - How's that?\\
176 - Oh, well, all right.\\
177 - I'll mail it into the magazine.\\
178 - Okay. Yeah, I'll, I'll give it to him
the minute he comes in.\\
179 - Ross? Ross, I don't know if I ever
told you,\\
180 - but, you know, I play "Glowworm" on
the saxophone,\\
181 - and I have sort of an act built
around it where I...\\
182 - Ross? Ross? Oh, Ross?\\
183 - Operator, you cut us off.\\
184 - Oh, he did?\\
185 - Okay, thanks.\\
186 - Hi, honey.\\
187 - Hi.\\
188 - How's the article coming?\\
189 - Fine. I'm all finished.\\
190 - Good.
Hey, Ross called.\\
191 - There's a message on the desk there.\\
192 - Yeah?\\
193 - Hey, this is great.\\
194 - Television show Coast To Coast\\
195 - for the Heart Fund, huh?\\
196 - Yeah, Ross seemed pretty excited
about it.\\
197 - Uh, Ricky?\\
198 - Yeah.\\
199 - About the television show, I have a
question for you.\\
200 - Well, I'm pretty sure what it is\\
201 - and I have an answer for you.\\
202 - Well, I'm pretty sure what your
answer is\\
203 - but let me ask it anyway.\\
204 - All right.\\
205 - Can I be on the show?\\
206 - No.\\
207 - Ten seconds.\\
208 - That's the fastest we've ever done
it.\\
209 - That's all you're gonna say?\\
210 - You're not gonna get mad or anything?\\
211 - Why should I get mad?\\
212 - I get a sinkin' filling in my stomach\\
213 - when you get that look in your face.\\
214 - Oh, don't be silly.\\
215 - Why should you get a "sinkin'
filling"?\\
216 - After all, if you don't want me on
the show,\\
217 - that's your business.\\
218 - Well, I must say, you're very
understanding.\\
219 - Hmm, sure, just forget I asked.\\
220 - Good.\\
221 - Now, would you like to see\\
222 - my answers to these questions?\\
223 - Yeah, I sure would.\\
224 - Which set would you like to see?\\
225 - Which set?\\
226 - Yes, I made an alternate set.\\
227 - These are about my dear, darling
husband\\
228 - who's such a considerate angel,\\
229 - and these are about the dirty rat\\
230 - who won't let me be on the show.\\
231 - You wouldn't dare.\\
232 - Oh, wouldn't I?\\
233 - But that's blackmail!\\
234 - Oh, come now, let's not call it that.\\
235 - That's what it is.\\
236 - I know, but let's not call it that.\\
237 - Now, would you like to hear me read
these?\\
238 - Never mind, never mind.\\
239 - I know when I'm licked.\\
240 - Then I can be on the show?\\
241 - Yes.\\
242 - Cuban Scout's honor?\\
243 - Cuban Scout's honor.\\
244 - Thank you, dear.\\
245 - Now then, what will we do on the
Heart Fund benefit?\\
246 - I have a few ideas. Listen...\\
247 - Now, if you don't mind, uh,\\
248 - I'll decide what we'll do on the
show, all right?\\
249 - Well...\\
250 - After all, blackmailers can't be
shoosers.\\
251 - I just want to make sure\\
252 - you "shoose" something that shows me
off.\\
253 - You just don't worry about that, all
right?\\
254 - You just mail this thing and leave
the rest up to me.\\
255 - I'll take care of you.\\
256 - That's what I'm afraid of.\\
257 - No, no, really, I got something for
you to do.\\
258 - Something good.\\
259 - Scout's honor.\\
260 - Well, okay.\\
261 - (piano playing)\\
262 - Skiddereatheroo\\
263 - Hey!\\
264 - Skiddereatheroo\\
265 - Hey!\\
266 - Shake hands with all your neighbors\\
267 - And kiss the Colleens all\\

May\\
269 - In dear old Donegal.\\
270 - Well, that's fine.\\
271 - Great.\\
272 - Yes, sir, that'll be great in the
show.\\
273 - Hi, everybody.
Hi, honey. Hi.\\
274 - Hi.
Hi.\\
275 - What kept you?\\
276 - Oh, honey, I had to wait for Mother
to get back\\
277 - from the hairdresser's so she could
take care of the baby.\\
278 - Oh, that's right.
But I'm here now.\\
279 - Come on, let's rehearse.\\
280 - Okay, let's see now.\\
281 - Let me get your...\\
282 - Here's your music.\\
283 - Oh, boy! I get to sing, huh?\\
284 - La da...\\
285 - "Humoresque"?\\
286 - I'm not the "humoresque" type.\\
287 - Why don't you let me sing a song\\
288 - that's more of my style, like...\\
289 - Let me go, let me go\\
290 - Let me go, lover\\
291 - Let me go, let me go\\
292 - Let me go, lover...\\
293 - Wait. Hey, hey, hold on, lover.\\
294 - Look, after hearing that,\\
295 - I'm tempted to really let you go,
lover.\\
296 - Oh, stop.\\
297 - Now, this is a very cute bit.\\
298 - It's kind of a musical trick.\\
299 - See, we sing two songs at dif... the
same time.\\
300 - Two songs at the same time?\\
301 - That's right, but they work out
together all right.\\
302 - Oh?\\
303 - Fred, you know the bit, don't you?\\
304 - Sure.
You to show it to her?\\
305 - Yeah, I don't mind.
Let Fred do it for you,\\
306 - then you can see what I mean.\\
307 - You sing "Humoresque," and I'll sing
"Swanee River."\\
308 - All right.\\
309 - (piano plays)\\
310 - One... two...\\
311 - Way down upon Song of many joys,\\
312 - The Swanee River My magic song of
sweet rejoice\\
313 - Keep ringing Until night is gone\\

320 - You think so?
Yeah.\\
321 - Okay. Here you are, honey.\\
322 - Now, you sing "Humoresque" and I'll
sing "Swanee River."\\
323 - (clearing throat): Yeah.\\
324 - You ready?
Okay.\\
325 - Give us a key there, Marco.\\
326 - (piano plays)\\
327 - Give you two.\\
328 - One, two...\\
329 - Way down upon Songs of many joys\\
330 - The Swanee River My magic song of
sweet rejoicing keep ringing\\
331 - Far, far away.
My humoresque.\\
332 - There's...
There's where my heart is yearning
ever...\\
333 - No, no.\\
334 - What's the matter?\\
335 - You started singing "Swanee River."\\
336 - You got to stick to "Humoresque."\\
337 - You switched.\\
338 - Oh, I thought something sounded
funny.\\
339 - Well, I know "Swanee River" so much
better.\\
340 - Why don't you let me sing that.\\
341 - Oh, sure, honey, here.\\
342 - Okay.\\
343 - You ready, Marco?
Give us a...\\
344 - (piano plays)\\
345 - One, two...\\
346 - (off-key): Way, way, way, way, way...\\
347 - Way\\
348 - Way down upon the Swanee River...\\
349 - Wait, hold on, wait a minute...\\
350 - What's the matter?\\
351 - Honey, you got to wait for me.\\
352 - We got to do it together.\\
353 - Oh, yeah, yeah.\\
354 - Okay.\\
355 - (piano plays)\\
356 - On two.\\
357 - One, two...\\
358 - Way down upon Song of many joys\\
359 - The Swanee River My magic song of
sweet rejoicing keep ringing\\
360 - Far, far, far, far away Until night
is gone, my humoresque.\\
361 - There is where my heart\\
362 - Is turning, turning, turning,
turning, turning\\
363 - There is where the old folks stay.\\
364 - You just can't do it.\\
365 - You can't do it at all.\\
366 - What do you mean I can't do it?\\
367 - You said I could be in the show.\\
368 - Well, honey, I'm sorry, but I tried.\\
369 - You can't do this and I got the whole
show routine.\\
370 - There's nothing for you to do.\\
371 - Well, gi-give me something else to
do.\\
372 - I'm sorry, honey.\\
373 - The whole show is already a routine.\\
374 - There is nothing that you can do.\\
375 - Oh, isn't there?\\
376 - It's a good thing I didn't mail this.\\
377 - I guess I'll have to mail them my
revised copy after all.\\
378 - I thought you tore that up.\\
379 - What did you do, paste it together?\\
380 - No. I just saved a carbon copy in
case of an emergency.\\
381 - And this, my Latin lover, is an
emergency.\\
382 - Uh, yeah, well, wute...
wait a minute.\\
383 - On second thought, I think there is
something\\
384 - in there that you can do.\\
385 - Oh. What is it?\\
386 - It's a Spanish dance number.\\
387 - Spanish dance number.
I can do that.\\
388 - Come on, let's rehearse it.\\
389 - Well, uh, if you don't mind,\\
390 - I would like to go to the mailbox\\
391 - and drop the right answers in the box
first.\\
392 - Okay.\\
393 - Honestly, did you ever see anybody\\
394 - stick to an idea like Lucy?\\
395 - She's a regular human mustard
plaster.\\
396 - Where did Ricky go?\\
397 - Oh, he went down to the corner,\\
398 - but he'll be back in a minute.\\
399 - Oh, I just wanted to check with him
on this costume.\\
400 - It's for the Spanish dance-- the
matador number.\\
401 - I'll catch him later.\\
402 - Just a minute.\\
403 - Does somebody's head go in there?\\
404 - Yeah.\\
405 - Uh, this isn't by any chance a
Spanish dance\\
406 - between a lady matador and a Cuban
bull, is it?\\
407 - No, Ricky's the matador.\\
408 - I don't know who he's got for the
bull.\\
409 - Oh, brother! What'll Lucy do\\
410 - when she finds out she's the bull?\\
411 - She'll probably gore him.\\
412 - I think I'd better warn her.\\
413 - Now, Ethel, do me a favor and keep
your big bazoo shut.\\
414 - Okay.\\
415 - Yeah.\\
416 - (laughing)\\
417 - What's the matter?\\
418 - Oh, boy, this is a switch.\\
419 - For once, the bull will be full of
Lucy.\\
420 - (laughing out loud)\\
421 - Shh!\\
422 - Well, we mailed it.\\
423 - Let's get on with the rehearsal.\\
424 - Uh, all right, now, here's how the
way\\
425 - that the Spanish, uh, dance number
goes, you see.\\
426 - Uh-huh.
I come out and I sing a few bars\\
427 - and then you make your entrance.\\
428 - Uh-huh.\\
429 - Okay, now, you come from here,\\
430 - and you come like this.\\
431 - Like that?\\
432 - Yeah, that's right. Like that.\\
433 - Go on. Try it.\\
434 - Try it.\\
435 - No, no, no. No, honey.\\
436 - Don't, don't snap your fingers, dear.\\
437 - Well, I'm pretending I have castanets
in them.\\
438 - Well, the part you play doesn't use
any castanets.\\
439 - No castanets?\\
440 - Do it again without the castanets.\\
441 - Go ahead. Go on.\\
442 - (clearing throat)\\
443 - Are you sure this is right?\\
444 - That's right.\\
445 - I've seen very few Spanish dancers\\
446 - in this position.\\
447 - Well, honey, the song explains the
whole thing.\\
448 - I'm not by any chance a senorita with
lumbago, am I?\\
449 - No, no. Let me explain it to you,
honey. Look.\\
450 - You see, at this part of the number,\\
451 - I go back here and I take out a big
red cape.\\
452 - And as you come on, I go, "Toro!
Toro!"\\
453 - Toro?!\\
454 - Yeah.\\
455 - Isn't that Spanish for bull?\\
456 - Yeah.\\
457 - Ricky Ricardo, you tricked me!\\
458 - Now, just a minute.\\
459 - The bull is very important in this
number.\\
460 - It's a very dramatic role.\\
461 - Oh, sure.\\
462 - It is, honey.\\
463 - Now I'm out here, I'm doing this
number,\\
464 - and when the bull comes in, you see,
you're just ferocious.\\
465 - You're just fierce\\
466 - and you're just stamping the ground\\
467 - and you're pawing at it\\
468 - and you're wild with rage.\\
469 - Your only thought is to kill me.\\
470 - You can say that again.\\
471 - Well, look, honey, I have given you
your chance.\\
472 - If you don't	    Oh.
want it...\\
473 - Some chance.\\
474 - Hey, Ricky.\\
475 - Yeah.\\
476 - The prop department wants to know\\
477 - if this is all right,\\
478 - or do you want them to make some
changes?\\
479 - Yeah, this is fine.\\
480 - It's silly of me to ask, but what is
that?\\
481 - It's your costume.\\
482 - My costume?\\
483 - Yeah.\\
484 - Oh, she going to wear this?\\
485 - Well, I thought she was, but I guess
that...\\
486 - Uh, yeah.\\
487 - Yeah, I'm going to wear it.\\
488 - Well, good girl. Good girl.\\
489 - Shall I tell the prop department it's
all right?\\
490 - Well, now, let me see.\\
491 - Yeah, I think it looks...\\
492 - You know what I would like, though?\\
493 - I would like a more ferocious, uh,
fierce look.\\
494 - You know, like...\\
495 - Let me see that again.\\
496 - Could you come along and let them see
that expression?\\
497 - I could never describe it.\\
498 - Hey, I'm surprised, Lucy.\\
499 - I didn't think you'd go through with
it.\\
500 - Yeah, what made you change your mind?\\
501 - Well, Ricky's right.\\
502 - The bull is very important in this
number,\\
503 - at least he will be, shall we say,\\
504 - with a slight change of personality.\\
505 - (trumpet fanfare playing)\\
506 - (applause)\\
507 - (upbeat music playing)\\
508 - Shake hands with your Uncle Mike, me
lad\\
509 - And kiss your Cousin Kate\\
510 - She's the one you used to swing a-by
the garden gate\\
511 - Shake hands with all the neighbors\\
512 - And kiss the Colleens all\\
513 - You're as welcome as the flowers in
May\\
514 - In dear old Donegal\\

continues)\\

526 - (trumpet fanfare)\\
527 - (waltz playing, applause)\\
528 - I am Fernando the Matador\\

532 - Ole! Ole! Ole!\\

534 - Ole! Ole! Ole!\\
535 - As fearless as fearless can be\\
536 - Today I meet Toro the Terrible\\
537 - He's mean and he's brave and he's
tall\\
538 - A shiny black hide with a devil
inside\\
539 - El Toro, the king of them all\\
540 - Ole! Ole! Ole!\\
541 - Fernando the Fearless, that's me\\
542 - Ole! Ole! Ole!\\
543 - As fearless as fearless can be\\
544 - (trumpet fanfare)\\
545 - (slow-tempo music playing)\\
546 - The trumpets blare\\
547 - Let the contest begin\\
548 - The gates open wide\\
549 - The bull rushes in\\
550 - Toro!\\
551 - Toro!\\
552 - (brisk lively music playing)\\
553 - The arena is hushed\\
554 - There is no sound\\
555 - He lowers his head\\
556 - And paws at the ground\\
557 - Toro!\\
558 - Toro!\\
559 - Toro!\\
560 - Closer and closer\\
561 - He lunges by\\
562 - With a look of anger\\
563 - And hate in his eyes\\
564 - Toro!\\
565 - The fight rages on\\
566 - Beast against man\\
567 - The blood will soon\\
568 - Run red on the sand\\
569 - El Toro is weary from my attack\\
570 - To show who is master\\
571 - I turn my back\\
572 - (thump)\\
573 - I take out my sword\\
574 - The end is near\\
575 - The moment for the kill is here\\
576 - (cymbals clashing)\\
577 - Toro!\\
578 - (lively music playing)\\
579 - (waltz playing)\\
580 - (cymbals clashing)\\
581 - (thump)\\
582 - I am Fernando the Matador\\

4 - You're certainly hot tonight.\\
5 - Ah, it's just the cards, you know.\\
6 - Come on, Lucy.\\
7 - Hey, what are you doing out there?\\
8 - Oh, I'm just enjoying this
sensational California weather.\\
9 - Imagine a night like this at this
time of year.\\
10 - If we were back home where it's cold,\\
11 - do you know what we'd be doing right
now?\\
12 - Yeah, pounding on the pipes for you
to give us more heat.\\
13 - Baloney.\\
14 - I mean, if we were back in New York,\\
15 - we'd be out shoveling snow.\\
16 - You mean I'd be out shoveling snow.\\
17 - Oh, now, honey, but I only let you
shovel the snow\\
18 - because I had to keep an eye on the
furnace.\\
19 - Yeah, to be sure that nobody put any
coal in it.\\
20 - To hear you talk, you'd think I...\\
21 - Oh, all right now, you two.\\
22 - I don't want to start anything.\\
23 - I just want to make sure\\
24 - that we all appreciate California
while we're here.\\
25 - Yeah.\\
26 - Hey, Ethel, you know something?\\
27 - What?\\
28 - We're gonna get to celebrate\\
29 - our wedding anniversary in
California.\\
30 - What's the matter, Ricky?\\
31 - Th-The cards are very slippery.\\
32 - Th-They get out of your hands.\\
33 - It's hard to shuffle them.\\
34 - Lucy, I didn't realize\\
35 - you had a wedding anniversary\\
36 - coming up so soon.\\
37 - From the look on his face, neither
did Ricky.\\
38 - What are you talking about?\\
39 - I knew we had a wedding anniversary\\
40 - coming up so soon.\\
41 - You did, huh?\\
42 - I knew it was coming up.\\
43 - I was just talking to myself the
other day, you know,\\
44 - and saying that how much fun it'd be\\
45 - to celebrate the wedding anniversary\\
46 - here in California.\\
47 - How about that?\\
48 - Wouldn't that be fun?\\
49 - (chuckling nervously)\\
50 - When is it?\\
51 - "When is it?"\\
52 - (forced laughter)\\
53 - That's a ridiculous question, "When
is it?"\\
54 - (laughing harder)\\
55 - I made four spades-- double.\\
56 - Come on, honey.\\
57 - Ricky, what day is it?\\
58 - What day is it?\\
59 - It's Monday.\\
60 - Yesterday was Sunday; today is

72 - Isn't she a doll?\\
73 - (laughing): Mickey.\\
74 - (baby crying)\\
75 - Honey, now look, you woke up the
baby.\\
76 - I'm sorry.\\
77 - (door closes)\\
78 - Ethel, when is it?\\
79 - I don't know.\\
80 - What do you mean you don't know?\\
81 - You were there at our anniversary
party last year.\\
82 - So were you.\\
83 - Fred, you remember?\\
84 - Oh, uh, how about May 3?\\
85 - That date sticks in my mind for some
reason.\\
86 - Ah, no, no.\\
87 - Oh, no, no, that's the day I fell
down\\
88 - and broke my leg.\\
89 - Or was that the day I got the gout?\\
90 - Fred, for your information,\\
91 - May 3 is our wedding anniversary.\\
92 - Well, I knew it was tied in with some
painful memory.\\
93 - Stop the stale jokes, will you?\\
94 - Help me think of this.\\
95 - Let's see.\\
96 - You know what they ought to do?\\
97 - They ought to declare a national
holiday\\
98 - and let everybody celebrate their
anniversary\\
99 - on the same day.\\
100 - Yeah. How about April 1?\\
101 - Yeah.\\
102 - Honestly.\\
103 - (whistling)\\
104 - Uh, Mrs. McGillicuddy, honey...\\
105 - Yes?\\
106 - Do you remember when Lucy got
married?\\
107 - Certainly.\\
108 - When was it?\\
109 - Years ago.\\
110 - No, I mean, uh, what was the date?\\
111 - Date? Oh, uh,\\
112 - I'm no good at dates, but, um, it was
sometime in the spring.\\
113 - Thanks a lot.\\
114 - Looking for something?\\
115 - (gasps, then mutters)\\
116 - Ohhh. We-we-we got to talking about
marriages and everything\\
117 - and I was looking at my beautiful
ring.\\
118 - Well, don't bother.\\
119 - We didn't have them engraved.\\
120 - Ricky Ricardo, you have forgotten the
date\\
121 - of our anniversary, haven't you?\\
122 - Certainly not.\\
123 - All right, then, when is it?\\
124 - Say, uh, you keep asking me that
question a lot of times,\\
125 - uh, I bet that you've forgotten.\\
126 - I have not.
We were married on...\\
127 - Ah. Oh, no, you don't.\\
128 - You're not gonna trick me into
telling you.\\
129 - I don't have to trick you into
telling. I know.\\
130 - You do not.\\
131 - Oh, yes, I do.\\
132 - As a matter of fact, uh,\\
133 - I have a whole, uh, party planned\\
134 - at the Mocambo for that night.\\
135 - Oh, but how can you, Rick, when you
don't...\\
136 - Deal the cards, Fred!\\
137 - You have a party planned for what
night, Ricky?\\
138 - Uh, for the night of our anniversary.\\
139 - And what night is that, Ricky?\\
140 - Well, darling, if you don't know when
your own anniversary is,\\
141 - I'm certainly not going to tell you.\\
142 - (whispering): Hello. Give me Western
Union, please.\\
143 - Western Union?\\
144 - I want to send a wire to Greenwich,
Gonnecticut,\\
145 - to the head of the License Bureau.\\
146 - That's right.\\
147 - Look. Here's the message.\\
148 - "Wire me the information of the date\\
149 - "of the marriage of Lucille
McGillicuddy\\
150 - and Ricardo Alberto Fernando Ricardo

151 - Ricardo.\\
152 - Yeah, yeah. As in "Montalban," yeah.\\

160 - Acha, Acha.\\
161 - Thank you, but I'm not sneezing.\\
162 - That's a name.\\
163 - Well, it's not funny to me.\\
164 - And sign it "Ricky Ricardo, Beverly
Palms Hotel."\\
165 - Thank you.\\
166 - Sheesh!\\
167 - Uh, this is Ricky Ricardo.\\
168 - Look, have you got a wire for me?\\
169 - Will you please look?\\
170 - It's on its way up?\\
171 - Thank you.\\
172 - What's on its way up?\\
173 - Uh...\\
174 - Breakfast?\\
175 - Yeah! Yeah!\\
176 - About time.\\
177 - I ordered it a half an hour ago.\\
178 - Why were you whispering?\\
179 - My throat.\\
180 - What's the matter with your throat?\\
181 - (doorbell buzzing)
Honey, honey,\\
182 - will please get me some cough
medicine?\\
183 - I think I'm catching a cold.\\
184 - Well, honey, you're not coughing.\\
185 - Oh, I've been coughing...\\
186 - (coughing): all morning.\\
187 - Okay.\\
188 - All right, honey.
I'll get it.\\
189 - You should have your bathrobe on.\\
190 - If you think you're catching a cold,\\
191 - you shouldn't run around without your
bathrobe.\\
192 - Yeah, that's right.
You're right, honey.\\
193 - You're right, you're right.\\
194 - Why don't you think of those things?\\
195 - Yes, darling, yes.\\
196 - Good morning, Mr. Ricardo!\\
197 - There we are.\\
198 - You know anything about a wire for
me?\\
199 - Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. I'm sorry.\\
200 - Ricky, where is your bathrobe?\\
201 - Uh...\\
202 - Oh, here it is.
I got it.\\
203 - Here. Put this on.\\
204 - Lovely breakfast.\\
205 - Okay. Thank you.\\
206 - Here you are.\\
207 - Take this.\\
208 - What's that?\\
209 - Cough medicine.\\
210 - I don't want any cough...\\
211 - Come on! Oh, now, look what you made
me do.\\
212 - I got enough of it.\\
213 - Shh! Come on, let's have breakfast.\\
214 - All right. There. You sit over there,
darling. Come on.\\
215 - Oh, honey, I don't want to sit there.\\
216 - Come on, let's sit down here where
we're comfortable.\\
217 - Those seats...
No, those chairs are too low.\\
218 - I'm... I just...\\
219 - Yesterday I almost broke my back
trying to...\\
220 - You get the silverware.\\
221 - Napkins. Put them down there.\\
222 - It's much more comfortable over here,
honey.\\
223 - Put them down over there.\\
224 - There we are.\\
225 - It's much better here.\\
226 - Okay. Boy, I'm hungry.\\
227 - Whoa! They look good this morning.\\
228 - Lucy!\\
229 - What?\\
230 - Lucy...\\
231 - I was very, very disappointed\\
232 - with the way you acted last night.\\
233 - The way I acted?\\
234 - Yes. Thinking that\\
235 - I've forgotten our wedding
anniversary.\\
236 - Well, now, honey...\\
237 - All right, when is it?\\
238 - Now, honey, don't you know that I
love you?\\
239 - Well, yes, but...\\
240 - Look, there's just one way you can
prove you remember.\\
241 - All right.\\
242 - All right, I'll tell you.\\
243 - But, uh, first give me a hug, huh?\\
244 - Why?\\
245 - As a vote of confidence.\\
246 - (chuckling): All right.\\
247 - That's my baby.\\
248 - How could you possibly think\\
249 - that I'd forgotten our wedding
anniversary?\\
250 - Well, you wouldn't tell me.\\
251 - Well, darling, I've known all my life\\
252 - that our wedding anniversary has
always been on the 7th.\\
253 - Oh, then you did know.\\
254 - Yes.\\
255 - Oh, you're wonderful.\\
256 - Well, I feel much better now.\\
257 - So do I.\\
258 - Wait a minute, I'll be right back.\\
259 - I want to tell Ethel.\\
260 - Yes, darling.\\
261 - She said you were just like all other
husbands.\\
262 - Oh, she did, huh?
Yeah.\\
263 - Hey, is that party still on?\\
264 - Yeah, oh, yes!\\
265 - Mmm!
Yes, sir! Yeah.\\
266 - The party... oy.\\

272 - Hello, Ross.\\
273 - Look, this is Ricky Ricardo.\\
274 - I want you to plant a news item for
me.\\
275 - You see, I forgot the date of our
wedding anniversary.\\
276 - Well, that's not news.\\
277 - All right, all right.\\
278 - Now, look, I forgot the date of our
wedding anniversary.\\
279 - So, I told Lucy that I have a big
party planned\\
280 - at the Mocambo for that night, the
night of the 7th.\\
281 - Now, can you put something in the
paper\\
282 - that, you know, makes it look like
the invitations\\
283 - have been out for a couple of weeks
or something?\\
284 - Sure, Ricky, I'll have it in tomorrow
morning's paper.\\
285 - Good.\\
286 - Of course in order to get it in at
this late notice,\\
287 - I'll, I'll have to make it sound
important.\\
288 - That's all right.
Whatever you have to do, Ross.\\
289 - Thank you very much.\\
290 - Da da dee\\
291 - Da ba da...\\
292 - Well, I told Ethel you were just
kidding.\\
293 - You knew the date all along, that the
party is on.\\
294 - Good girl! Come on.\\
295 - Let's have our breakfast, huh?\\
296 - Okay.\\
297 - Ricky?\\
298 - Yes, darling.\\
299 - I love you, honey.\\
300 - I love you, sweetheart.\\
301 - (sighing)\\
302 - Mother, do you have anything that
should go to the cleaners?\\
303 - No.\\
304 - Honestly, the way this stuff piles
up.\\
305 - Well, you certainly made the
headlines.\\
306 - What do you mean?\\
307 - Well, it's right here on the movie
page.\\
308 - It tells all about the anniversary
party\\
309 - Mickey's giving for you at the
Mocambo tonight.\\
310 - No kidding.\\
311 - Mm-hmm. Listen.\\
312 - "Ricky Ricardo..."\\
313 - Hmm, how do you like that?\\
314 - They spelled Mickey's name wrong.\\
315 - "...is hosting a 15th anniversary
party\\
316 - "for his wife Lucy at the Mocambo
tonight.\\
317 - "Invitations went out last week\\
318 - "to such notables as Esther Williams
and Ben Gage,\\
319 - "Elizabeth Taylor and Michael
Wilding,\\
320 - Robert Taylor and Ursula Thiess..."\\
321 - For heaven's sake!\\
322 - All those movie stars coming to my
party?\\
323 - Let me see.\\
324 - "Van and Evie Johnson,\\
325 - "Cary and Betsy Grant,\\
326 - June Allyson and Dick Powell..."\\
327 - Oh, Mother, isn't it exciting?\\
328 - Oh! Oh, you great, big wonderful
doll, you!\\
329 - Say, what's all this?\\
330 - My party at the Mocambo.\\
331 - It's written up in the paper.\\
332 - Oh, really?\\
333 - And to think that I doubted you.\\
334 - It says right here in the paper\\
335 - that the invitations were sent out
last week.\\
336 - You know, Mickey, in spite of all my
predictions,\\
337 - I think you're going to turn out all
right.\\
338 - Thanks.\\
339 - And, honey, the guest list.\\
340 - Guest list?\\
341 - Well, I think almost every star\\
342 - in Hollywood is gonna be there.\\
343 - Yeah. Yeah?\\
344 - (muttering)\\
345 - Geesh.\\
346 - I guess Lassie couldn't make it.\\
347 - Honey, when you first told me about
the party,\\
348 - I never dreamed it would be anything
like this.\\
349 - Neither did I.\\
350 - I mean, you know, once I got started,\\
351 - I figured I'd go all the way, you
know.\\
352 - Nothing is too good for my baby\\
353 - and her 15th wedding anniversary.\\
354 - I'm going right over and tell the
Mertzes\\
355 - all about the party, honey.\\
356 - And I'm going down and get another
paper\\
357 - and show it to that snooty Mrs.
Anderson.\\
358 - She thinks her daughter is such a
much.\\
359 - Oh, ha, ha.\\
360 - (phone ringing)\\
361 - Hello.\\
362 - Hi. What did you think\\
363 - of that spread in the paper this
morning?\\
364 - Yeah, well, that was wonderful, Ross,\\
365 - but, uh, didn't you overdo it a
little?\\
366 - This thing is liable to cost me a
fortune.\\
367 - How many of those people are coming?\\
368 - None.\\
369 - None?!\\
370 - No, I just printed the names of the
people\\
371 - I knew would be out of town.\\
372 - Oh.\\
373 - Wait a minute, boy.
This is worse.\\
374 - What am I going to tell Lucy?\\
375 - Uh...\\
376 - Thank you very, very much for
calling.\\
377 - Yes, sir, I'll call you.
Good-bye.\\
378 - They must be out having breakfast or
something.\\
379 - Gee, I can hardly wait to tell Ethel
about all the movie stars.\\
380 - Well, now, honey...
Oh, here they are. Ethel!\\
381 - Don't go too overboard, honey.\\
382 - You-you never know what might...
happen.\\
383 - Ricky, you go over and talk some
sense into the Mertzes.\\
384 - They make me so mad.\\
385 - What's the matter?\\
386 - They think they're not invited to my
party.\\
387 - Aw, come now, of course they're
invited.\\
388 - Well, that's what I tried to tell
them,\\
389 - but they want to know why they didn't
get\\
390 - their invitations last week.\\
391 - Oh. Uh...\\
392 - I told them they were family.\\
393 - They weren't expected to get a formal
invitation,\\
394 - for heaven's sake.\\
395 - Good. I mean, that's true, yeah.\\
396 - And then they wanted to know why
their name wasn't in the paper.\\
397 - Yeah, well, uh...\\
398 - I'll go, I'll go and talk to them.\\
399 - Sure they're invited.\\
400 - Mira que quiere decir que no estan
invitados.\\
401 - Ricky!\\
402 - Yeah?\\
403 - Just a minute.\\
404 - What's the meaning of this?\\
405 - Uh...\\
406 - No hablo ingles.\\
407 - You come back here.\\
408 - You hablo plenty of ingles\\
409 - and you'd better start "habloing"
right now.\\
410 - Tengo que irme.\\
411 - Adios, muchacha.\\
412 - Come back here, or I'll adios your
muchacha.\\
413 - All right.\\
414 - All right.\\
415 - I forgot the date.\\
416 - I admit it.\\
417 - Is that a crime?\\
418 - Yes!\\
419 - Oh, now, honey, now, I-I don't blame
you\\
420 - for being a little upset,\\
421 - but aren't you being unreasonable?\\
422 - No!\\
423 - Aw, come now, honey.\\
424 - You forgot the date of our anni...\\
425 - if you forgot the date of our
anniversary,\\
426 - how could you have sent those
invitations out last week?\\
427 - Yeah, well, uh...\\
428 - that's another thing.\\
429 - Uh...\\
430 - There, there, there were no
invitations.\\
431 - None of those peoples are coming.\\
432 - None of those peoples are coming?\\
433 - No. You see, uh...
that was Ross' idea.\\
434 - He-he-he thought he would, uh,\\
435 - put it in the paper for publicity.\\
436 - Publicity!\\
437 - Now, look, honey,\\
438 - we'll, we'll have our party at the
Mocambo.\\
439 - You and I and the Mertzes will go
there...\\
440 - You have your party.\\
441 - I'm not going!\\
442 - What do you mean?\\
443 - Just what I said, I'm not going.\\
444 - Aw, come now, honey,\\
445 - you-you don't mean that you're not
going to go\\
446 - to your anniversary party with me?\\
447 - That's just what I mean.\\
448 - No, no, you don't mean that.\\
449 - Don't tell me what I mean!\\
450 - Now, look, I'm going to start getting
mad\\
451 - pretty soon, too, you know.\\
452 - I'm going to give you your last
chance.\\
453 - Now, are you going to go\\
454 - to your anniversary party with me or
not?\\
455 - No, I am not!\\
456 - All right. Then I'll go by myself.\\
457 - Go ahead.\\
458 - All right.\\
459 - All right.
Okay!\\
460 - Okay!
Okay.\\
461 - All right!\\
462 - Yeah!\\
463 - Happy anniversary to...\\
464 - Oh, keep quiet!\\
465 - What's the matter?\\
466 - Oh, you're always singing!\\
467 - Now, Lucy, this is not funny anymore.\\
468 - Now, for the last time, are you going
to go\\
469 - to your anniversary party with me or
not?\\
470 - What am I supposed to do with these?\\
471 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
472 - I'll be right with you.\\
473 - Now, look, Lucy,\\
474 - the Mertzes and I are going to the
Mocambo.\\
475 - It is your anniversary party.\\
476 - We would love to have you with us.\\
477 - Gin.\\
478 - All right.\\
479 - I'm going to tell you something.\\
480 - I'm going to go out of that door\\
481 - and when I go out of that door, I'm
not coming back here.\\
482 - Are you going to let me go?\\
483 - That does it.\\
484 - Ooh, he makes me so mad!\\
485 - Imagine, going nightclubbing on his
anniversary\\
486 - while he leaves his poor wife sitting
home alone.\\
487 - Yeah.\\
488 - You're not gonna let him get away
with it, are you?\\
489 - I certainly am not.\\
490 - I'm gonna... I'm...\\
491 - What do you mean, I'm not gonna let
him get away with it?\\
492 - It's your anniversary just as much as
it is his.\\
493 - Call the Mocambo, reserve a table\\
494 - and have your own anniversary party.\\
495 - Well, that won't be much fun just
sitting there alone.\\
496 - Look at it this way.\\
497 - With you there, it will completely
louse up his evening.\\
498 - Yeah.\\
499 - Oh, no, I couldn't go by myself.\\
500 - Will you go with me?\\
501 - Sure.\\
502 - Mrs. Anderson will sit with the baby.\\
503 - Good.\\
504 - Uh, yeah. Maybe we can get a couple
of fellas.\\
505 - What?\\
506 - How would it look for two women to
walk into a nightclub alone?\\
507 - Oh, that's right.\\
508 - We'll need an escort.\\
509 - Well, now, let's see, who do we know?\\
510 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
511 - Come in!\\
512 - Here's your evening paper.\\
513 - (orchestra playing "La Vie En Rose")\\
514 - ("La Vie En Rose" playing)\\
515 - (song ends)\\

528 - But I'm in a little bit of a problem.\\
529 - Uh... you see, I forgot the date of
my anniversary...\\
530 - ...and my wife is not speaking to me.\\
531 - That's the very lovely redhead over
there.\\
532 - I tried to tell her today that I was
sorry and everything,\\
533 - but she won't budge.\\
534 - And then I had an idea\\
535 - and I hope that this will does it.\\
536 - Come on, fellas.\\
537 - (piano plays)\\
538 - Tonight is our night\\
539 - And here we are\\
540 - But it's not the way that I planned\\

542 - You know how I feel\\

\subsection {Episode 25: The Star Upstairs}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Hi.
Hi, girl.\\
3 - I just saw your mother and Little
Ricky\\
4 - on the way to the park again.\\
5 - Isn't that wonderful?\\
6 - They can go outside every day in
California.\\
7 - What are you doing?\\
8 - Writing in my trip diary.\\
9 - Let's see now.\\
10 - "Friday, we went to Farmers Market.\\
11 - Saw Robert Taylor squeezing oranges."\\
12 - Yeah, some oranges have all the luck.\\
13 - Wait till the girls back home see the
orange I have\\
14 - that Robert Taylor touched.\\
15 - And you've got his autograph to prove
it.\\
16 - Yeah. Wasn't he cute when he said\\
17 - he'd never signed an orange before?\\
18 - (laughing)\\
19 - Too bad you didn't get him\\
20 - to autograph something more
permanent.\\
21 - You'll have to throw that orange away
eventually.\\
22 - Never. That orange and I\\
23 - are going to grow old and wrinkled
together.\\
24 - How many movie stars does that make
we've seen?\\
25 - Well, let's see now.\\
26 - I got them all right back here.\\
27 - Eighty-four...\\
28 - Ninety-nine!\\
29 - We just need one more to make a
hundred.\\
30 - Oh, hi, Ethel.\\
31 - ETHEL: Hi, Rick.\\
32 - Hey, Lucy.\\
33 - Listen to this item in Sheila
Graham's column.\\
34 - "A well-known star has been ordered
by the doctor\\
35 - "to get away from it all\\
36 - "and has taken a room at one of our
local hotels.\\
37 - "I wouldn't give away the secret
hiding place,\\
38 - but the hotel's first name is
Beverly."\\
39 - Beverly! I'll bet that movie star's\\
40 - hiding right here at the Beverly
Palms.\\
41 - Or the Beverly Hills Hotel\\
42 - Let's see now.\\
43 - Well-known star.\\
44 - I wonder who it is.\\
45 - I just got to find out.\\
46 - Why is it such a matter of life and
death?\\
47 - Because we've already found 99 movie
stars\\
48 - since we came to Hollywood.\\
49 - We need one more to make an even
hundred.\\
50 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
51 - Oh, hi, Bobby.\\
52 - Hi, Mrs. Ricardo.\\
53 - Oh, Mr. Ricardo, I brought up the
trade papers.\\
54 - You got a mention today.\\
55 - Variety, page eight, column three. I
circled it.\\
56 - Thank you.\\
57 - Well, I'll say that's real service.\\
58 - Oh, I'm always looking for items
about guests here in the hotel.\\
59 - Oh, say Bobby, I'll bet you'd know.\\
60 - What's that?\\
61 - About that item in Sheila Graham's
column.\\
62 - Is some movie star hiding out in this
hotel?\\
63 - Um, um... I don't know anything about
it.\\
64 - Not much you don't.\\
65 - No, honest, I haven't the slightest
idea\\
66 - who's up in the penthouse.\\
67 - The penthouse!
I was right.\\
68 - Who is it, Bobby?
Who is it?\\
69 - No, no, I've said too much already.\\
70 - Aw, come on now, Bobby.\\
71 - All we want to know is, is it a man
or woman?\\
72 - Aw, come on, Bobby.
You can trust us.\\
73 - We're your friends.\\
74 - Yeah. Come on.\\
75 - All we want to know is, is it a man
or a woman?\\
76 - Now, the manager's not allowed us to
discuss him.\\
77 - Then it's a man!\\
78 - What's his name?\\
79 - Bobby, what's his name?\\
80 - Oh, come on, Bobby.\\
81 - Mr. Ricardo, help!\\
82 - All right. All right, girls.\\
83 - Help!\\
84 - All right, girls.
Lay off of him.\\
85 - Why don't you pick on somebody your
own size?\\
86 - Yeah!\\
87 - LUCY: All we want to know is the
name.\\
88 - For heaven's sake, what's wrong with
that?\\
89 - Don't you tell them anything that
you're not supposed to.\\
90 - I won't.\\
91 - Come on, I'll convoy you to the door.\\
92 - Thank you, Mr. Ricardo.\\
93 - If anybody finds out that Cornel
Wilde is...\\
94 - Cornel Wilde!\\
95 - Right here in our hotel.\\
96 - Yeah!\\
97 - Oh, well, I can always get a job\\
98 - at the new Beverly Hilton.\\
99 - Oh, don't worry, Bobby, your secret's
safe with us.\\
100 - LUCY: Sure, sure.	  Yeah, I
bet.\\
101 - Good-bye.
Good-bye, Bobby.\\
102 - Cornel Wilde, right up there in that
penthouse.\\
103 - Boy!\\
104 - All we have to do now is figure out
how to get a look at him.\\
105 - Wup-up-up-up-up.\\
106 - What are you wup-up-upping about?\\
107 - Now, we're gonna nip this thing in
the bud right now.\\
108 - Cornel Wilde came here\\
109 - to get away from people, remember?\\
110 - I don't want to bother him.\\
111 - All I want to do is see him.\\
112 - Oh well, that I can arrange.\\
113 - You can?
Sure.\\
114 - Oh, you know him from the studio.\\
115 - Will you really arrange so I can see
him?\\
116 - Sure. Tonight we'll go see his new
picture The Big Combo.\\
117 - Got wonderful reviews.\\
118 - Oh... you know what I mean.\\
119 - I want to see him up close.\\
120 - All right, we'll sit in the front
row.\\
121 - Oh, Ricky, now, you can't do this to
me.\\
122 - One of the biggest movie stars in
Hollywood\\
123 - is right over my head, under my nose.\\
124 - Now, look, Lucy, I've got a message
for you.\\
125 - Well, slip it under the door.\\
126 - I'll read it later.\\
127 - I'm telling you, I want you to forget
that he's up there.\\
128 - Forget it?
But Ricky, why should...\\
129 - But...\\
130 - Yeah, but...\\
131 - Hi.\\
132 - What are you doing?\\
133 - Trying to hear Cornel Wilde up there.\\
134 - Oh, any luck?\\
135 - No. If he's walking around,\\
136 - he's wearing bunny fur scuffies.\\
137 - I got another idea cooking, though.\\
138 - I'll bet you have.\\
139 - I told Bobby to bring some ice water
up here.\\
140 - When he gets up here,		
Lucy...\\
141 - I'm going to ask him if he could
possibly\\
142 - Lucy...
tell me just when\\
143 - Lucille!
he goes in and out...\\
144 - What?!\\
145 - I hate to point this out,\\
146 - but Ricky told you to just forget\\
147 - that Cornel Wilde is up there.\\
148 - Well, for once in my life,\\
149 - I'm not gonna do what Ricky tells me.\\
150 - For once in your life!?\\
151 - You never do what he tells you.\\
152 - So why spoil a perfect record?\\
153 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
154 - Oh, I can't keep up with you.\\
155 - Here's your ice water.\\
156 - Won't you bring it in, Bobby?\\
157 - Would you set it on the coffee table,
please?\\
158 - Bobby...\\
159 - Miss Ricardo, I'm pretty busy.\\
160 - Bobby, I just want to ask a little
favor of you.\\
161 - The answer is no.\\
162 - Bobby, all I want to know is when he
goes in or out\\
163 - so I can take a little peek at him.\\
164 - He doesn't come in; he doesn't go
out.\\
165 - He just stays there.\\
166 - Oh...\\
167 - Look, please let me go.\\
168 - I got to take this up to you-know-who
right now.\\
169 - Why don't you give up, Lucy?\\
170 - Because I just got to see him.\\
171 - Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Ricardo,\\
172 - but the only person who's allowed in
to see him is me.\\
173 - Now, he came here for a rest.\\
174 - And the manager says if there are any
calls from....\\
175 - that I am to...\\
176 - Oh, no! Not that!\\
177 - Let me borrow your outfit, Bobby.\\
178 - Absolutely not!\\
179 - Bobby, all I want to do is take the
paper up,\\
180 - rap on the door.\\
181 - When he opens the door, I'll hand him
the paper\\
182 - and I'll take a little look and I'll
slam the door\\
183 - and he'll never know the difference.\\
184 - Absolutely impossible.\\
185 - Bobby... Bobby, I'd hate to have to
tell the manager\\
186 - that you were the one who blabbed all
over town\\
187 - that Cornel Wilde was there.\\
188 - You wouldn't!\\
189 - Oh, wouldn't I?\\
190 - (screaming): Bobby told everybody\\
191 - that Cornel Wilde was in the
penthouse!\\
192 - Mrs. Ricardo...
Cornel Wilde!\\
193 - Corn...\\
194 - Mrs. Ricardo... please!\\
195 - Gosh!\\
196 - How can anybody look so pretty on the
outside\\
197 - and be so sneaky on the inside?\\
198 - Isn't it awful?\\
199 - It's like smelling a rose, getting
stung by a bee.\\
200 - Bobby, let me borrow your outfit.\\
201 - No, ma'am.\\
202 - Bobby.
No, Mrs...\\
203 - Bobby.\\
204 - Mrs. Ricardo, please!\\
205 - (singing quietly)\\
206 - (humming)\\
207 - Turn around, fire...\\
208 - Be quick on the draw\\
209 - Or else one shot, there ain't no
more...\\
210 - (shower running)\\
211 - (humming)\\
212 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
213 - Come on in! The door's open.\\
214 - Bellboy.\\
215 - Come in.\\
216 - Bobby?\\
217 - Yes, sir?\\
218 - Oh, you got the paper?\\
219 - Yes, sir.\\
220 - Oh, good.
Well, uh, bring it in.\\
221 - I want to have something to read in
the bathtub.\\
222 - Come on, Bobby, let's have it.\\
223 - What's the matter with you?\\
224 - I can't reach it from the bathtub.\\
225 - Bring it in.\\
226 - (splash)\\
227 - Hey!\\
228 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
229 - Come in!\\
230 - Mrs. Ricardo?\\
231 - Yeah, Bobby?\\
232 - Oh, here's your broom.\\
233 - Oh. Thanks.\\
234 - I need it for an extension.\\
235 - This thing doesn't reach far enough
for me to see him.\\
236 - Thanks.\\
237 - Uh, Mrs. Ricardo...\\
238 - Huh?\\
239 - Could I ask you something?\\
240 - Sure.\\
241 - Why do you hate me?\\
242 - I don't hate you.\\
243 - Then why are you trying to get me
fired?\\
244 - Mr. Wilde doesn't like his newspaper
wet.\\
245 - I am not trying to get you fired,
Bobby.\\
246 - It's just that I want to see him.\\
247 - Well, just keep me out of it.\\
248 - Whose lunch is that?\\
249 - Uh, nobody's.\\
250 - Bobby...\\
251 - Honestly, honestly, it's a practice
meal.\\
252 - I'm gonna eat it myself.\\
253 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
254 - Come on in.\\
255 - Mr. Wilde, I brought up your lunch
and a fresh newspaper.\\
256 - That's good.
This one's so wet,\\
257 - you can read one page right through
the other.\\
258 - Yeah, well, I'm sorry about that.\\
259 - For a minute I thought\\
260 - President Eisenhower was playing golf
with Little Orphan Annie.\\
261 - (chuckling)\\
262 - Uh, where would you like the table
set, sir?\\
263 - Oh, I guess over here's fine.\\
264 - All right.\\
265 - There we are.\\
266 - Oh, uh, anything else, sir?\\
267 - Uh, oh, no, thank you.\\
268 - I'll just sign that now.\\
269 - Yes, sir.\\
270 - I put your tip on there too, Bobby.\\
271 - Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.\\
272 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
273 - Come in.\\
274 - Uh, Mr. Wilde, you, uh, finished with
your lunch?\\
275 - Yep. All set, thank you.\\
276 - Okay. All right.\\
277 - Ow!\\
278 - What's the matter, Bobby?\\
279 - Oh, sometimes the wheels stick\\
280 - and you sort of get it in the shin.\\
281 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
282 - Sorry, sir, I'm very clumsy today.\\
283 - Bobby.\\
284 - Yes, sir.\\
285 - I seem to be all out of ink.\\
286 - Do you know where there's any more
around here?\\
287 - Oh, there should be some in the desk.
Let's see.\\
288 - There you are, sir.\\
289 - Oh, thank you very much.\\
290 - Uh-huh. Anything else?\\
291 - No, fine. That's all.
Thank you.\\
292 - Okay, sir.\\
293 - Now, what's the matter?\\
294 - Oh...\\
295 - The wheels seem to be caught on the
furniture.\\
296 - I'll, I'll fix it, sir.\\
297 - LUCY: Ouch! That hurt.\\
298 - Well, I meant it to!\\
299 - Bobby!\\
300 - Now, what's going on?\\
301 - Uh, well... uh, nothing, sir.
Nothing.\\
302 - I... I'm just talking to myself.\\
303 - I do it all the time.\\
304 - My mother worries about me.\\
305 - Yeah, but I...\\
306 - I heard two different voices.\\
307 - Well, there couldn't have been two
voices\\
308 - when I'm the only one here, see?\\
309 - Oh, I get it.\\
310 - Well, I never expected it of you,
Bobby.\\
311 - What?\\
312 - Trying to audition.\\
313 - Well, I guess everybody wants into
show business.\\
314 - Where did you ever learn
ventriloquism?\\
315 - Ventriloquism?\\
316 - Why, I don't know the...\\
317 - Oh, ventriloquism!\\
318 - Oh, yeah. Well, I don't do it very
well.\\
319 - Oh, what I heard sounded darn good.\\
320 - Sounded just like a voice coming from
under the cart.\\
321 - Well, that's not too hard.\\
322 - Do it again.\\
323 - No, I'd rather not.\\
324 - Oh, come on.
Go ahead.\\
325 - LUCY: Yeah. Go ahead, Bobby, do it
again.\\
326 - Bobby, that's absolutely marvelous.\\
327 - I didn't even see your lips move.\\
328 - Well, it takes practice.\\
329 - Yeah, I've got to go now.\\
330 - Oh, no, don't go.
Do some more.\\
331 - No, don't go, Bobby.
Do some more.\\
332 - Ah, I saw your lips move that time.\\
333 - Well, I've really got to go now.\\
334 - Go ahead and go, but leave me here.\\
335 - Bobby, that's, that's fantastic.\\
336 - You're the best ventriloquist I've
ever seen.\\
337 - Thank you.\\
338 - Warm.\\
339 - Uh, can I have a sip of your water?\\
340 - Oh, sure. Go ahead.\\
341 - LUCY: When Irish eyes are smiling...\\
342 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay...\\
343 - Well, Bobby, wonderful.\\
344 - Absolutely wonderful.\\
345 - Bobby, I'm gonna call my agent and
tell him about you.\\
346 - Well, I wouldn't want you to go to
too much trouble.\\
347 - It's no trouble at all.\\
348 - I'll be doing him a favor.
You're sensational.\\
349 - BOBBY: Well, if he is interested, he
could call me here\\
350 - at the, at the hotel.\\
351 - Okay, I'll have him call you here.\\
352 - Okay, thank you, sir.\\
353 - Hey, Bobby.\\
354 - Yes, sir?\\
355 - Just do that little voice for me\\
356 - once more, will you?\\
357 - Okay.\\
358 - (clearing throat)\\
359 - We have to go now.\\
360 - Say good-bye.\\
361 - (animated voice): Bye. We have to go
now.\\
362 - Bobby, it's absolutely incredible.\\
363 - I-I could have sworn\\
364 - your voice was coming from behind the
couch.\\
365 - Yeah.\\
366 - I can't believe it.\\
367 - I've got to hand it to you, Bobby.\\
368 - I'm certainly gonna tell my agent.\\
369 - Yeah, well, well, thank you, sir.\\
370 - LUCY: Thank you, sir.\\
371 - (chuckling)\\
372 - Oh, wonderful.\\
373 - Uh, I won't forget to tell him,
Bobby.\\
374 - No, no, I thank you. I know.\\
375 - Well, good-bye.\\
376 - Bye.\\
377 - (sighing)\\
378 - (humming)\\
379 - Lucy?\\
380 - Lucy?\\
381 - LUCY (whispering): Ethel?\\
382 - Ethel, are you down there?\\
383 - Lucy? Where are you?\\
384 - I'm up here.\\
385 - What are you doing up there?!\\
386 - Shh! I'm locked out on the balcony.\\
387 - Locked out on the balcony?\\
388 - Shh! Be quiet.\\
389 - I'll explain later.\\
390 - Is Ricky there?\\
391 - No.\\
392 - Good. I want you to help me down.\\
393 - Help you down?\\
394 - Yeah. I figured a way to lower myself
over the side\\
395 - and I want you to pull me in when I
go by.\\
396 - I won't do it.\\
397 - It's a long ways down there.
You might fall.\\
398 - Never mind that.\\
399 - Now, do as I say.\\
400 - I need some scissors.\\
401 - Put it on the end of that broom.\\
402 - What broom?\\
403 - It's over by the coffee table.\\
404 - Where are the scissors?\\
405 - In that desk.\\
406 - The broom...\\
407 - Shoot.\\
408 - I ought to be used to this type
thing.\\
409 - Here they come.\\
410 - Okay.\\
411 - Here I come.\\
412 - Honey, I'm home.\\
413 - Hi, Rick!\\
414 - Oh, hi, Ethel. Where's Lucy?\\
415 - Uh, I don't know.\\
416 - Oh, she's probably hanging around the
hotel somewhere.\\
417 - You can say that again.\\
418 - Uh, what's new, Rick?\\
419 - What's the matter with you, Ethel?\\
420 - Oh, nothing.\\
421 - If-if Lucy isn't here, I...\\
422 - I'd like to listen to what's happened
to you\\
423 - because you've been so nice to me,
Ricky.\\
424 - I wouldn't even be in California\\
425 - if it wasn't for you and your career.\\
426 - That's true. Yeah.\\
427 - (stammering): Rick, I...\\
428 - Would you like to know about a new
cake\\
429 - I've learned how to bake?\\
430 - You-you take a half a cup of butter
for this cake\\
431 - and you cream it.\\
432 - And then...
and then you...\\
433 - Ethel!\\
434 - Oh, then you add the frosting!\\
435 - What's the matter with you, Ethel?\\
436 - Are you crazy or something?\\
437 - No, no, no. Well, I got to go now.\\
438 - I hate to eat and run.\\
439 - We didn't eat.\\
440 - Well, some other time.\\
441 - Where are you going?\\
442 - Oh, I got to pick up a friend.\\
443 - (laughing nervously)\\
444 - (phone ringing)\\
445 - I'm telling you. Hmm.\\
446 - Hello.\\
447 - Oh, hi, Cornel.\\
448 - Yeah. I thought you were hiding out.\\
449 - Sure. I'd love to play some gin.\\
450 - Okay. I'll come up.\\
451 - Okay.\\
452 - Oh! Oh, Lucy, you're here!\\
453 - Oh, thank goodness.
I've been looking\\
454 - all over the grounds for you.\\
455 - Are you all right?\\
456 - (mumbling)\\
457 - Oh, poor little thing.\\
458 - What broke your fall?\\
459 - One of the...\\
460 - most uncomfortable palm trees in
California.\\
461 - Well, bless its little heart.\\
462 - Yeah. Well...\\
463 - (phone ringing)\\
464 - (groaning)\\
465 - Hello?\\
466 - Hi, honey. This is Ricky.\\
467 - Oh, hi.\\
468 - Hey, Ricky?
Just a minute.\\
469 - You want some cream in your coffee?\\
470 - No, just black.
All right.\\
471 - Listen, honey, I'm up in Cornel
Wilde's apartment.\\
472 - You're what?\\
473 - I'm up in Cornel Wilde's apartment\\
474 - and I want you to come up and meet
him.\\
475 - Are you sure this is Ricky?\\
476 - Yes, honey.\\
477 - You see, you were so nice about...
about not bothering him\\
478 - that I want to give you a reward.\\
479 - Oh.\\
480 - Now, you see how well things work out\\
481 - when you do what I tell you?\\
482 - Yes, sir.\\
483 - Well, you want to come up?\\
484 - Oh, yes. Yes, I... Yes, sir.\\
485 - Uh, uh... I'll be right up as soon as
I... powder my nose.\\
486 - Bye.\\
487 - What happened?\\
488 - Ricky's with Cornel Wilde and he
wants me to come up.\\
489 - At last you're gonna get to meet him
face-to-face!\\
490 - Finally.
You want to come with me?\\
491 - Can I?\\
492 - Sure. H-H-Help me g-g-get de-palmed,
will you?\\
493 - Okay.\\
494 - Do I look all right?\\
495 - Oh, you look wonderful.\\
496 - Hey, what took you so long?\\
497 - Oh, well, I... I had to...
to change my clothes,\\
498 - but I'm ready now. Come on.\\
499 - It's too late now. He's gone.\\
500 - Gone? Where?\\
501 - He moved to another hotel.\\
502 - Why?\\
503 - I don't know. I guess the news of him
being here leaked out.\\
504 - We just found evidence of a prowler
in his balcony.\\
505 - Ew...\\
506 - ANNOUNCER: Next week, I Love Lucy
will be brought to you by\\
507 - Lilt Home Permanents.\\

\subsection {Episode 26: In Palm Springs}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - You want coffee, don't you, Fred?\\
3 - Okay.\\
4 - Yes?\\
5 - Good. You can take care of us, huh?\\
6 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
7 - Thank you very much. Good-bye.\\
8 - Is it all set, honey?\\
9 - Yes, sir, by Wednesday,\\
10 - we'll be lolling in the Palm Springs
sun.\\
11 - Oh, great.
Oh!\\
12 - Palm Springs.\\
13 - Oh, that'll be great.\\
14 - Play golf and everything, huh, Fred?\\
15 - Yes, sir.
Hey, Lucy, are there\\
16 - Huh?
any of those cakes left\\
17 - that we bought at the Farmers Market?\\
18 - Oh, gee, I don't know, Ethel.\\
19 - I'll see if...\\
20 - Ethel, we've just had dinner.\\
21 - Are you gonna feed your face again?\\
22 - Well, I just want a little extra
something.\\
23 - From where I'm sitting,\\
24 - you've already got that little extra
something.\\
25 - Here they are.\\
26 - RICKY: What are we gonna do tonight?\\
27 - I'd like to go to a movie.\\
28 - Well, let's see.\\
29 - Look up something good now, Lucy.\\
30 - Rock Hudson!\\
31 - In what?\\
32 - In Palm Springs.\\
33 - Are you looking up a movie?\\
34 - No, I'm reading Hedda Hopper.\\
35 - She says Rock Hudson has returned\\
36 - from a personal appearance tour\\
37 - with his exciting new picture,
Captain Lightfoot,\\
38 - and he's resting in Palm Springs.\\
39 - That's right. He told me at lunch the
other day\\
40 - he was going down there.\\
41 - Do you know him?\\
42 - Here he is hobnobbing with big
celebrities every day.\\
43 - It just doesn't mean a thing to him.\\
44 - Honey, they're just like anybody
else.\\
45 - "They're just like anybody else."
Oh...\\
46 - Oh...\\
47 - See if you can find a neighborhood
movie.\\
48 - (chuckling)\\
49 - All right.\\
50 - What's so funny?\\
51 - RICK: What's so funny?!\\
52 - Well, it seems they arrested a woman
last night\\
53 - for hitting her husband.\\
54 - I fail to see anything comical about
that.\\
55 - Well... it was the way it happened.\\
56 - They were married for 20 years.\\
57 - He had this irritating habit of
cracking his knuckles.\\
58 - Finally she couldn't stand it and she
said,\\
59 - "Don't crack your knuckles anymore,
dear. Let me do it."\\
60 - And she cracked them with a baseball
bat!\\
61 - (both laughing hysterically)\\
62 - Well, they...\\
63 - (laughing uncontrollably)\\
64 - I've often...\\
65 - Well, they've finally crossed that
thin dividing line.\\
66 - I don't see why you have to get so
hysterical about it.\\
67 - I don't know, but the idea of someone
finally letting go\\
68 - and doing exactly as they've wanted
to do for 20 years\\
69 - just kills me.\\
70 - (guffawing)\\
71 - I know just how she felt.\\
72 - Yeah, imagine...
with a baseball bat.\\
73 - Pow!\\
74 - (laughing harder)\\
75 - ETHEL: A baseball bat.\\
76 - Well, she couldn't have loved her
husband very much,\\
77 - my goodness, if a little knuckle
cracking\\
78 - is all she had to put up with.\\
79 - What do you mean by that, Lucy?\\
80 - What?\\
81 - "If a little knuckle cracking is all
she had to put up with."\\
82 - Oh, I didn't mean anything, dear.\\
83 - Everybody has little habits that
annoy somebody else.\\
84 - Are you insinuating\\
85 - that I have habits that drive you
crazy?\\
86 - Honey, I didn't say that you had any
annoying habits\\
87 - that drive me crazy.\\
88 - What do you mean by that?\\
89 - Oh, honey, now, you're only human.\\
90 - All right, go ahead.\\
91 - Mention one annoying habit that I
have.\\
92 - Go on. Mention one.\\
93 - Well, if you insist.\\
94 - That tapping.\\
95 - What tapping?\\
96 - That tapping.\\
97 - Oh, well. Huh.\\
98 - I never did that before.\\
99 - Never did it bef...
Oh, honey!\\
100 - You've been tapping those nervous
little fingers\\
101 - for 15 years.\\
102 - Well, I beg your pardon.\\
103 - Oh, honey, now, don't let it upset
you.\\
104 - Nowadays it doesn't bother me much,\\
105 - but I will admit it used to set my
teeth on edge.\\
106 - Muchas gracias.\\
107 - Well, are we going to a movie or
aren't we?\\
108 - Yeah, see what's playing around here,
Ethel.\\
109 - Look in the paper, will you?\\
110 - Okay.\\
111 - At the Pantages is, uh...\\
112 - May I say that you're not the only
one\\
113 - that has the tith on edge.\\
114 - (clinking)\\
115 - Oh?\\
116 - Go on.\\
117 - What is it about me that sets your
"tith" on edge?\\
118 - No, no, go ahead, tell me what little
habit I have\\
119 - that drives you crazy.\\
120 - Ha, you know what it is.\\
121 - No, I don't.\\
122 - You're doing it right now.\\
123 - I'm not doing anything now.\\
124 - Is your coffee too hot?\\
125 - No.\\
126 - Then why are you stirring it?\\
127 - Every morning for hours and hours and
hours.\\
128 - Tickily tink, tickily tink, tickily
tink.\\
129 - Tickily tink, tickily tink.\\
130 - Well, that's the most ridiculous
thing I ever heard.\\
131 - I'm just stirring it enough to get
the cream mixed in.\\
132 - (laughing): "Get the cream mixed in."\\
133 - You stir it long enough to make
butter.\\
134 - Why, breakfast wouldn't be breakfast
without you\\
135 - pounding out "the anvil chorus" on
your coffee cup.\\
136 - Well, I'm very sorry that I set your
tith on edge.\\
137 - And that's another thing.\\
138 - You're always mucking the way I talk.\\
139 - That's because there's so much there
to "muck."\\
140 - Oh, yeah?\\
141 - Yeah.\\
142 - Well...\\
143 - Now wait a minute.
Wait a minute, will you?\\
144 - (keys jingling)\\
145 - Take it easy.\\
146 - You're acting like that couple in the
paper.\\
147 - Are we going to a picture or not?\\
148 - Not.\\
149 - Oh, now, you're just acting childish.\\
150 - Married people are only human.\\
151 - (wry chuckle)\\
152 - You just have to learn to overlook
these little things.\\
153 - Sure.\\
154 - Imagine if I let Ethel's irritating
habits\\
155 - get on my nerves.\\
156 - What irritating habits are you
referring to, Frederick?\\
157 - It's nothing.\\
158 - You just said we'd have to overlook
these things.\\
159 - What things?\\
160 - Oh, now, let's not be specific,
honeybunch.\\
161 - You'd only get sore.\\
162 - No, I wouldn't, dear.\\
163 - Go on, tell me.\\
164 - Well, here's a little thing.\\
165 - You enjoy your food so much,\\
166 - you eat it with a lot of...\\
167 - Gusto?\\
168 - Relish?\\
169 - Enthusiasm?\\
170 - Well, frankly the word I had in mind
was...\\
171 - (smacking)\\
172 - Noise!\\
173 - Noise?!\\
174 - You, you, you asked me and I told
you.\\
175 - (keys jingling)\\
176 - Speaking of noise, I have a
compliment for you.\\
177 - For me?\\
178 - Well, what is it?\\
179 - (keys jingling)\\
180 - You going to tell me?\\
181 - Yes, just as soon as you finish that
chorus of "Jingle Bells."\\
182 - "Jingle bells"?\\
183 - What are you talking about?\\
184 - (chuckling): "Jingle bells."\\
185 - (mirthless chuckle)
(jingling)\\
186 - So I jingle my keys a little.\\
187 - A little! For 25 years,\\
188 - I felt like I was married to the Good
Humor Man!\\
189 - Well, it certainly is very
interesting to find out\\
190 - that we've been driving each other
crazy all these years.\\
191 - Yeah.\\
192 - Yeah.
Yeah.\\
193 - (tapping, clinking, smacking,
jingling)\\
194 - Yes? Something bothering you?\\
195 - You are deliberately not stirring
your coffee.\\
196 - I am not.\\
197 - Yes, you are.\\
198 - I am not deliberately\\
199 - not stirring my coffee.\\
200 - No me digas lo que estas haciendo.\\
201 - Look, let me tell you something.\\
202 - If you expect to argue with me,\\
203 - will you please argue in English?\\
204 - How can I answer anything?\\
205 - Hey, hey, hey.\\
206 - I just came from the preliminaries.\\
207 - I'm glad I'm in time for the main
event.\\
208 - Oh, you, too, huh?\\
209 - Yeah, but, uh, our bout was a little
bit dull--\\
210 - all in English.\\
211 - No international flavor, like yours.\\
212 - Well, I don't blame Ethel, Fred.\\
213 - That was terrible, your telling her
she chewed like a cow.\\
214 - Why, if you ever said a thing like
that...\\
215 - Oh, now, lay off, will you, Lucy?\\
216 - I just went ten rounds with Old
Bossy.\\
217 - Aah.\\
218 - Oh, there you are.\\
219 - I want the key to the trunk\\
220 - unless you need it to play a tune.\\
221 - How'd you like to hear\\
222 - a couple of choruses of "Cow Cow
Boogie"?\\
223 - Fred, you take that back!\\
224 - All right, I'll take that back.\\
225 - What's the matter with all of us?\\
226 - We're snapping at each other like
four cats in a sack.\\
227 - We are, aren't we?\\
228 - Yes, we are, and I know\\
229 - why we're getting on each other's
nerves.\\
230 - Why?\\
231 - Because we've been together too much
on this trip.\\
232 - Any four people that have spent this
much time together\\
233 - are bound to get sick of each other.\\
234 - Lucy, I think you've hit it.\\
235 - Yeah. So the four of us\\
236 - are gonna go to Palm Springs and
share a bungalow.\\
237 - Oh, dear.\\
238 - Well, there's just one thing to do:\\
239 - One couple go to Palm Springs, the
other couple stay here.\\
240 - Oh, that doesn't seem fair.\\
241 - Well, it's the only way, Ethel.\\
242 - We'll tell you all about it when we
get back.\\
243 - Wait a minute.\\
244 - How come you're the couple that's
going?\\
245 - Yeah.\\
246 - Oh, I don't know.\\
247 - I just picked a couple at random and
it was us.\\
248 - No, no, I'll tell you what we'll do.\\
249 - We'll flip a coin.\\
250 - Heads, the Mertzes will go; tails, we
go. Okay?\\
251 - LUCY: Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.\\
252 - We're going at this thing all wrong.\\
253 - We're planning to spend the weekend\\
254 - with the person who annoys us the
most.\\
255 - Oh, yeah.\\
256 - We're paired off wrong.\\
257 - Now she tells me.\\
258 - All right, so who's gonna go to Palm
Springs?\\
259 - Either Ethel and I, or Fred and you.\\
260 - Okay.\\
261 - Yeah. Yeah.
Okay. Shall I flip the coin?\\
262 - All right, heads, we go; tails, you
stay.\\
263 - Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.\\
264 - You won't catch me with that again.\\
265 - That's how I happened to get married.\\
266 - Oh...\\
267 - So I made a mistake.\\
268 - Uh, heads, we go; tails, you go.\\
269 - That's better.\\
270 - All right? Okay.\\
271 - Two out of three.\\
272 - Lucy...\\
273 - Three out of five.\\
274 - Four out of seven.\\
275 - All right, all right.\\
276 - You and Ethel go to Palm Springs.\\
277 - Have a good time.\\
278 - You mean it?\\
279 - It's either that or 223 out of 349.\\
280 - (sighs)\\
281 - It says here\\
282 - this is the first time it's rained in
Palm Springs\\
283 - during this month in 20 years.\\
284 - No kidding.\\
285 - Well, leave it to us to pick this
time.\\
286 - Any break in the clouds?\\
287 - Huh?\\
288 - Any break in the clouds?\\
289 - Oh, I wasn't looking at that.\\
290 - I thought maybe a movie star would
float by.\\
291 - You know, the waiter told me this
morning\\
292 - that Rock Hudson's staying in that
bungalow next door.\\
293 - "Palm Springs--\\
294 - where the sunshine spends the
winter."\\
295 - Where's the sun?\\
296 - Maybe it couldn't get a room.\\
297 - Well, I'm going in\\
298 - and take a nap with the baby.\\
299 - Okay, Mother.\\
300 - I wonder what the boys are doing in
Hollywood.\\
301 - Oh, they're probably down at the pool\\
302 - swimming and sunning.\\
303 - And jingling and tapping.\\
304 - Jelly.\\
305 - Do you want some more coffee?\\
306 - Nope.\\
307 - Oh! Cherry.\\
308 - Mmm...\\
309 - Mmm...\\
310 - (Noisy smacking)\\
311 - Whoa-ho-ho-ho!\\
312 - (smacking)\\
313 - (smacking)\\
314 - Mmm, mmm, mmm.\\
315 - Ethel, will you stop it?!\\
316 - I can't stand it another minute!\\
317 - Stand what?\\
318 - What was I doing?\\
319 - What's the matter with you?\\
320 - Can't you eat quietly?\\
321 - You sound like a cow pulling its foot
out of the mud.\\
322 - I am getting a little tired of being
called a cow.\\
323 - Well, do you have to make so much
noise?\\
324 - Yes. Yes, I do.\\
325 - I have to do something\\
326 - to drown out the sound of your
clinking.\\
327 - I'm going stir-crazy.\\
328 - Well, I beg your pardon.\\
329 - Oh, I'm sorry, Ethel.\\
330 - I guess my nerves are on edge.\\
331 - I wish we hadn't come on this trip at
all.\\
332 - I miss Ricky.\\
333 - I can top that. I miss Fred.\\
334 - I wish they were down here right now,
taps, clinks and all.\\
335 - So do I.\\
336 - Well, let's call them up\\
337 - and tell them to come down right
away, huh?\\
338 - Okay!\\
339 - Oh, wait a minute.
You can't do that.\\
340 - Why not?\\
341 - Well, if you call them up,\\
342 - it'll be just admitting that we were
wrong\\
343 - and that we miss them.\\
344 - Well, we were wrong, and we do miss
them.\\
345 - You can't tell a husband a thing like
that!\\
346 - You'll set wives back 2,000 years.\\
347 - Oh, don't be silly.\\
348 - I'm ready to forgive and forget.\\
349 - You forgive and they'll never let you
forget.\\
350 - Well, how else are we gonna get them
down here?\\
351 - Oh, there must be another way.\\
352 - We can think of something.\\
353 - Is it ever gonna stop raining?\\
354 - Aw, what's the difference?\\
355 - The ball game's called off.\\
356 - Nuts!\\
357 - Just when I had a chance to see the
Hollywood stars.\\
358 - Well, we can't play golf and we can't
go swimming.\\
359 - What are we gonna do?\\
360 - Well, if this rain keeps coming down,\\
361 - we might as well start building an
ark.\\
362 - Well, we got to do something besides
just sit in this room.\\
363 - Well, we can always go and sit in my
room.\\
364 - Very clever remark.\\
365 - Heh, heh, heh, heh.\\
366 - I liked it.\\
367 - (keys jingling)\\
368 - (keys jingling)\\
369 - Do you have to jingle those keys?!\\
370 - Will you stop that tapping?!\\
371 - You know, the way we're snapping at
each other,\\
372 - you'd think we were married.\\
373 - Yeah.\\
374 - You know what I think it is?\\
375 - What?\\
376 - Well, this might sound crazy to you,\\
377 - but I think we miss our wives.\\
378 - Oh, come now.\\
379 - No, really. I miss Lucy.\\
380 - You don't suppose I miss Ethel?\\
381 - Why else would you be acting so
cranky and irritable?\\
382 - Well, my liver could be out of whack.\\
383 - Come on! Let's go join them.\\
384 - Let's get out of this miserable rain\\
385 - and into that wonderful Palm Springs
sunshine.\\
386 - We gotta have a story.\\
387 - We just can't run down there there
and say we miss 'em.\\
388 - Well...\\
389 - (phone ringing)\\
390 - Get that.\\
391 - Hello.\\
392 - Palm Springs.\\
393 - Maybe the girls.\\
394 - Hello?\\
395 - Uh-uh.\\
396 - Yes, this is Ricky Ricardo.\\
397 - Oh, yes.\\
398 - Yes...\\
399 - Oh, ye... sure.\\
400 - I could come...\\
401 - I could leave right away.\\
402 - Okay. Thank you.\\
403 - That would be wonderful.\\
404 - This is perfect.\\
405 - That was Dore Schary's secretary.\\
406 - She wants me to come to Palm Springs\\
407 - and meet with Dore for a picture.\\
408 - Gee, what a break!\\
409 - Isn't that great?
Great.\\
410 - Go pack your bags.\\
411 - Oh, boy! What a recipe for chocolate
cake.\\
412 - Oh, Ethel,\\
413 - you're always thinking about
something to eat.\\
414 - MRS. McGILLICUDDY: Come on, baby.
On to Mom, darling.\\
415 - Here we are!\\
416 - Hi!\\
417 - Hi, sweetie!\\
418 - Ah, we had a nice long walk.\\
419 - Now we're going to go in and get a
cookie.\\
420 - All right, honey.\\
421 - But don't let him eat too much.\\
422 - I don't want him to spoil his dinner.\\
423 - All right.\\
424 - Come on, now.\\
425 - Come on, we walk back.
There we go.\\
426 - Bye, lovey.
Say bye-bye to Mom.\\
427 - Oh, isn't this wonderful?\\
428 - Oh, thank goodness that sun came out.\\
429 - Why are you all covered up?\\
430 - You know I don't want to get sunburn.\\
431 - I don't get it. What was all that
talk\\
432 - about "Where's the sun?"\\
433 - Well, it's the principle of the
thing.\\
434 - I paid for the sun.\\
435 - It's my business whether I use it or
not.\\
436 - Lucy!\\
437 - (hoarse whisper): Rock Hudson!\\
438 - Pardon me.\\
439 - Aren't you Mrs. Ricky Ricardo?\\
440 - Y-Yes.\\
441 - I mean, yes.\\
442 - Well, I'm Rock Hudson.\\
443 - (laughing): Oh, ye... well, I know
that.\\
444 - How do you do?\\
445 - How do you do?\\
446 - Uh, uh, this is Mrs...\\
447 - Mrs., um, uh...\\
448 - Mertz.\\
449 - Mertz?\\
450 - Oh, yeah, yeah.\\
451 - Uh, Mrs. Mertz.\\
452 - How do you do?
How do you do?\\
453 - Did Ricky come with you?\\
454 - Uh, no, no.\\
455 - He couldn't get away.\\
456 - Oh, that's too bad.\\
457 - You mind if I join you?\\
458 - Oh, why, certainly we don't mind.\\
459 - Oh, no!\\
460 - Uh, um, uh...\\
461 - Would you like a piece of rock, Mr.
Candy?\\
462 - Oh... I know, of course.\\
463 - No, thank you.\\
464 - I, uh, just got some bad news about
somebody Ricky knows.\\
465 - Oh?\\
466 - Script girl at the studio,\\
467 - and I wanted to tell him about it.\\
468 - Oh, well, uh...\\
469 - w-w-wouldn't you like to tell me?\\
470 - I'll tell him.\\
471 - Well, I would like to talk to
somebody about it.\\
472 - if you wouldn't mind.\\
473 - Oh, no. Go right ahead.\\
474 - Well, this script girl, Adele
Sliff...\\
475 - Adele Sliff?\\
476 - Mm-hmm.\\
477 - Wonderful girl.\\
478 - She's been married for 20 years.\\
479 - Hmm.\\
480 - About three weeks ago, she and her
husband\\
481 - had their first fight.\\
482 - Oh.\\
483 - What did they fight about?\\
484 - A habit he had.\\
485 - A habit?\\
486 - A silly little habit.\\
487 - Hmm.\\
488 - What was it?\\
489 - He whistled all the time.\\
490 - He whistled?\\
491 - Absentmindedly, like this:\\
492 - (whistles monotone)\\
493 - Like that?\\
494 - Just the one note, all the time.\\
495 - (continues whistling monotone)\\
496 - (whistling)\\
497 - (whistling)\\
498 - Well! That would drive anyone crazy.\\
499 - Yeah!\\
500 - Sam would (whistles) all day\\
501 - and (whistles) all night\\
502 - and finally Adele couldn't stand it
any longer\\
503 - and she said, "Sam, just one more
(whistles)\\
504 - and I'll leave you."\\
505 - And?\\
506 - And he (whistles), and she did.\\
507 - She did? She left him?\\
508 - She left him.\\
509 - Just because he went (whistles)?\\
510 - Oh, well, they'll probably go back
together.\\
511 - Yeah. If you really love someone,\\
512 - you shouldn't let a little (whistles)
come between you.\\
513 - That's the sad part of it.\\
514 - Yesterday, Adele got a wire.\\
515 - And it said...\\
516 - Well, it said...\\
517 - What, Mr. Hudson?\\
518 - Well, you see, Sam was on his way
home\\
519 - to try to make up with her, and he
had an accident.\\
520 - (gasps)\\
521 - Adele flew to the hospital and went
into his room\\
522 - and there was Sam, wrapped in
bandages from head to foot.\\
523 - Adele said, Oh...\\
524 - "Sam, speak to me.\\
525 - Just one little (whistles)."\\
526 - All she wanted to hear\\
527 - was just one little (whistles)?\\
528 - Did he?\\
529 - No. It was all over.\\
530 - No (whistles)?\\
531 - No (whistles).\\
532 - Sam will never (whistles) again.\\
533 - Oh!\\
534 - Quite a sad story.\\
535 - LUCY: It certainly is.\\
536 - ETHEL: Wasn't that awful?\\
537 - LUCY: It shows you how one little
mistake\\
538 - can mess up your whole life.\\
539 - ETHEL: Yeah. Oh, dear.\\
540 - Well, Fred!\\
541 - Look who's here!
Hi!\\
542 - Oh, Fred!
Hey, Ricky!\\
543 - (laughing and clamoring)\\
544 - Oh, honey, I missed you so!\\
545 - Well, we missed you, too, honey.\\
546 - Oh, baby.\\
547 - (laughing)\\
548 - (laughing)\\
549 - (laughing uncontrollably)\\
550 - Wait a minute.\\
551 - Oh, you were great, man.\\
552 - What's so funny?\\
553 - You should win an award for that
performance!\\
554 - What are you talking about?\\
555 - I got to tell them.\\
556 - It's so great that I got to tell
them.\\
557 - What?\\
558 - You see, we didn't know how you would
feel about us,\\
559 - so we asked Rock to come over here
and kind of soften you up.\\
560 - Oh, really!\\
561 - Well, Ethel, what's the difference?\\
562 - The important thing is, we're all
together.\\
563 - You're not angry, are you?\\
564 - Oh, I should say not.\\
565 - You can soften me up any time.\\
566 - (all laughing)\\
567 - Well, Ricky, I got to go.
I'll see you later.\\
568 - Okay, Rock. Oh, listen.\\
569 - You know what bungalow Dore Schary's
staying in?\\
570 - Dore Schary?
Yeah.\\
571 - He's not here.\\
572 - He's not?
No.\\
573 - I can't understand that.\\
574 - His secretary called me on the
phone...\\
575 - "Would you mind coming down to Palm
Springs?\\
576 - "Mr. Schary would like to discuss\\
577 - a picture property with you."\\
578 - Was that you on the phone!?\\
579 - Oh, you...\\
580 - (laughing)\\
581 - I'll bet you think we're crazy, huh?\\
582 - Well... yes.\\
583 - Yeah, well, we are.\\
584 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
585 - ANNOUNCER: Mrs. McGillicuddy was
played by Kathryn Card.\\
586 - Rock Hudson portrayed himself.\\
587 - and his latest picture is Universal's
Captain Lightfoot.\\
588 - I Love Lucy is a Desilu Production.\\
589 - Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz\\
590 - will be back next week at this same
time.
\subsection {Episode 27: The Dancing Star}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Hi.\\
3 - -Hi.
-Hi.\\
4 - Where's Lucy?\\
5 - She went down to get the mail.\\
6 - Oh, well, I'll wait for her.\\
7 - Wouldn't she be the one to do
something like this?\\
8 - What's the matter, honey?\\
9 - Caroline Appleby gets in town today!\\
10 - What are you so upset about?\\
11 - It'll be wonderful to see Caroline
again.\\
12 - Sure.\\
13 - Well, ordinarily it would be, yes,\\
14 - but somehow she's gotten the idea\\
15 - that I'm surrounded by movie stars.\\
16 - Uh-huh. Where did she get an idea
like that, I'm pretty sure.\\
17 - Well, maybe in a letter\\
18 - I-I did drop a name here and there.\\
19 - Like, uh, who, for instance?\\
20 - Well, uh, I told her\\
21 - that I ate lunch with Clark Gable
last week.\\
22 - Oh, fine.\\
23 - Now, honey, why would you tell her
something like that\\
24 - when you know that it's not true?\\
25 - It is, too, true.\\
26 - I had lunch with Clark Gable.\\
27 - I was at Perino's\\
28 - and Clark was there and...
and we ate lunch together.\\
29 - At different tables, but...\\
30 - together doesn't necessarily mean...\\
31 - Okay, okay, we got it, we got it.\\
32 - Now, who else, who else did you tell
her\\
33 - that you've been palling around with?\\
34 - Well, uh, let's see-- Gary Cooper and
Bing...\\
35 - and, oh, yes, I did mention Marlon
Brando.\\
36 - Marlon Brando.\\
37 - Did you see On The Waterfront?\\
38 - Wonderful. He got the Academy Award,
you know.\\
39 - Oh, dear, she says she's going to be
here two whole days\\
40 - and wants to meet them all.\\
41 - What am I gonna do? Hmm?\\
42 - You don't even know\\
43 - what I was going to ask you.\\
44 - Whenever you get that tone in your
voice, the answer is no.\\
45 - Oh...\\
46 - Come on, Fred, we're late for our
golf date.\\
47 - Let's go to the club.\\
48 - Oh, come on now, Ricky.\\
49 - I'll see you later.\\
50 - Adios.\\
51 - Bye.\\
52 - LUCY: What am I gonna do?\\
53 - I know she's probably on her way over
here right now\\
54 - and I haven't even got an idea.\\
55 - You think of something.\\
56 - Listen, if Einstein can't work out a
problem,\\
57 - you don't hand it to Mortimer Snerd.\\
58 - But, Ethel, I'm desperate.\\
59 - Well, I never have any good ideas.\\
60 - Well, think!\\
61 - Well, Van Johnson was asleep down by
the pool a while ago.\\
62 - Van Johnson?\\
63 - Yeah. I'll see if he's still there.\\
64 - Yes, he's still there.\\
65 - So?\\
66 - Well...\\
67 - we could go down and carry him up
here without waking him up.\\
68 - And then we could put him on the
couch\\
69 - and when Caroline gets here, we'll
say he's a friend of ours\\
70 - and he just dropped by to take a nap.\\
71 - Thank you, Mortimer Snerd.\\
72 - Well...\\
73 - Eesh!\\
74 - Sheesh!\\
75 - "Carry him up here without waking him
up."\\
76 - "Just dropped by to take a nap."\\
77 - (phone ringing)\\
78 - Whew!\\
79 - Hello?\\
80 - Would you ask her to come up, please?\\
81 - Thank you.\\
82 - She's here.\\
83 - What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?\\
84 - Oh, Lucy, this is a tough one.\\
85 - You know, she'll blab this all over
New York.\\
86 - Yep.\\
87 - Well, I guess for once\\
88 - she's just gonna have to face the
music.\\
89 - (fingers snapping)\\
90 - I got it.\\
91 - From up here, you can't tell\\
92 - whether Van Johnson's asleep or not.\\
93 - Now, listen, I'm going downstairs\\
94 - and I'm going over by Van, I'm going
to sit down\\
95 - and I'm going to pretend to be
talking to him.\\
96 - You'll never know the difference,
see.\\
97 - Now, when-when Caroline comes in,\\
98 - you take her out on the balcony\\
99 - and I'll see her and I'll wave\\
100 - and-and you just tell her I'm down
there chatting\\
101 - with one of my movie star friends,
see,\\
102 - and then after I wave, I'll come on
up.\\
103 - Oh, that's a great idea!\\
104 - I'll go down the stairs while she's
coming up the elevator.\\
105 - Give me time now to get out by the
pool.\\
106 - Okay.\\
107 - (no audio)\\
108 - Oh, hi, Caroline.\\
109 - Oh, Lucy!\\
110 - Oh, how are you?\\
111 - Fine, dear.
I'm, I'm sorry I'm late,\\
112 - but I-I guess you saw me down by the
pool\\
113 - chatting with Van Johnson.\\
114 - No, she didn't.\\
115 - What?\\
116 - Oh, Lucy, I could just die.\\
117 - I lost my glasses on the plane\\
118 - and I can't see a thing without them.\\
119 - So you didn't see us?\\
120 - Well, I saw two redheaded blurs.\\
121 - Ethel told me it was you and Van
Johnson.\\
122 - Hmm... well, that's a shame.\\
123 - Gee, that means that you didn't see
Clark Gable\\
124 - or Walter Pidgeon or Hedy Lamarr.\\
125 - They were all down by the pool.\\
126 - They were?\\
127 - Oh, yes.\\
128 - Of course they were.\\
129 - I should have pointed them out to
you, Caroline.\\
130 - Well, it wouldn't have done any good
anyway.\\
131 - You really can't see, huh?\\
132 - Not a thing.\\
133 - Oh, they're still there.\\
134 - Hello, Clark. Hello, Walter.
Hello, Hedy.\\
135 - Oh, let's go down and see them up
close.\\
136 - Oh. Oh, well, good-bye, Clark.\\
137 - Good-bye, Walter.\\
138 - Bye, Hedy.\\
139 - They're off to the races.\\
140 - Oh...\\
141 - Oh, my goodness, Lucy, I certainly am
impressed.\\
142 - Wait till the girls back home hear
about this.\\
143 - Yeah.\\
144 - Uh, tell me,\\
145 - what's Van Johnson really like?\\
146 - Oh, he's just wonderful.\\
147 - Just the greatest.\\
148 - You know, he's appearing in a
nightclub here in the hotel.\\
149 - Yeah, I know.
I'd love to see a show.\\
150 - Oh, we see it almost every night.\\
151 - Oh, yeah, we've seen it 14 times,\\
152 - and does he work.\\
153 - He rehearses two or three hours every
afternoon.\\
154 - You know, um, Caroline,\\
155 - Van and I have gotten very chummy.\\
156 - Yes, as a matter of fact,\\
157 - he asked me to, uh, rehearse with him
this afternoon.\\
158 - What?!		What?\\
159 - Yeah, and, uh, you know, Caroline,\\
160 - if you promise to be very quiet,\\
161 - I could have Ethel sneak you in the
back of the ballroom,\\
162 - and you could watch the rehearsal.\\
163 - Oh, Lucy, you're a doll!\\
164 - What time is rehearsal?\\
165 - Uh, 2:00.\\
166 - Oh, that's wonderful because I was
going to do some shopping\\
167 - this afternoon, but I'll go out and
get done now,\\
168 - and then I'll be back.\\
169 - Oh, where is everything?\\
170 - Well, bye.\\
171 - Bye.		Good-bye.\\
172 - See you two.\\
173 - Good-bye.\\
174 - Bye.\\
175 - Lucy, you had such a fascinating
little mind.\\
176 - I kinda hate to see it go.\\
177 - What do you mean telling Caroline\\
178 - I could sneak her in the back...?\\
179 - Well, bub-bub-bub-bup.\\
180 - Now, Ethel, you've seen Van's act as
often as I have.\\
181 - Now, what does his partner look like?\\
182 - Well, she's tall, she's got red
hair...\\
183 - And how far can Caroline see without
her glasses?\\
184 - Well, she said she could only see
from about here to...\\
185 - Oh...\\
186 - Your little mind wasn't gone.\\
187 - It was just catnapping.\\
188 - Now, look, I'll hide over in your
apartment.\\
189 - When Caroline comes back, you take
her down to the ballroom.\\
190 - She'll see Van's partner, she'll
think it's me.\\
191 - Bring her back up here.\\
192 - I'll come in, all out of breath,
wiping my face with a towel.\\
193 - Oh, you've done it again, champ.\\
194 - How could you ever have doubted me?\\
195 - I was a fool.\\
196 - Hi, Ethel. I'm back.\\
197 - Hi.\\
198 - What are those?\\
199 - What?\\
200 - Those.\\
201 - Oh, my glasses.\\
202 - The airline's found them on the plane
and sent them over.\\
203 - Isn't that wonderful?\\
204 - Oh, yeah.\\
205 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
206 - Uh... is, uh, Lucy rehearsing with
Van?\\
207 - Oh, yes.\\
208 - Well, then, let's go.\\
209 - Uh, well, uh, uh, well,\\
210 - I think I'll, uh, I want to make a
phone call.\\
211 - I got to tell Fred something.\\
212 - Oh.\\
213 - Give me Room 317, please.\\
214 - (ringing)\\
215 - Hello.\\
216 - Hello, Fred?\\
217 - No, Fred isn't here right now.\\
218 - This is Ethel, Fred.\\
219 - Now, what's the matter with you,
Ethel? This is Lucy.\\
220 - I know that, Fred.\\
221 - I want to tell you something.\\
222 - Caroline's here, and we're going
downstairs\\
223 - to watch Lucy rehearse with Van
Johnson.\\
224 - Oh, Caroline's there.\\
225 - That's right, Fred,\\
226 - and, uh, we thought maybe you'd like
to go along.\\
227 - And if you do go along,\\
228 - I want you to be sure and wear your
glasses\\
229 - so you can see as good as Caroline
can.\\
230 - Wh-Wh-What... my glass...\\
231 - Caroline found her glasses?\\
232 - You guessed it, Fred, old girl... uh,
boy.\\
233 - Well, look, uh, uh, stall, stall.\\
234 - Uh, give me 15 minutes before you
bring her down.\\
235 - What are you gonna do?\\
236 - I don't know, but I'll think of
something.\\
237 - Okay, Fred.\\
238 - Good-bye, Fred.\\
239 - What's new, Caroline?\\
240 - Uh, is, uh, Fred coming with us?\\
241 - Fred who?\\
242 - Oh, uh, oh, that Fred?\\
243 - No, no, he's not going with us.\\
244 - He had something he had to do.\\
245 - Oh, well, then, let's go.\\
246 - Go?\\
247 - Oh, uh, down to watch them rehearse,
huh?\\
248 - Yeah.\\
249 - Well, okay, let's go.\\
250 - Fred!\\
251 - Hi, Caroline.\\
252 - How are you?\\
253 - I just came over here...\\
254 - Oh, bless his little heart!\\
255 - He came over to kiss me good-bye.\\
256 - Well, good-bye, Fred.\\
257 - Good-bye? Why, I just got home.\\
258 - Well, we're just leaving.\\
259 - I want to show her the hotel before
we watch them rehearse.\\
260 - Come on, honey.\\
261 - Hello, Marco.\\
262 - Hey, Van.\\
263 - I was pretty sloppy last night.\\
264 - We'd better get down to work.\\
265 - Where's Hazel?\\
266 - She's not here yet.\\
267 - That's funny.
She's usually on time.\\
268 - Let's see what I was doing wrong with
that second number.\\
269 - Take it from the top, Marco.\\
270 - (piano playing lilting song)\\
271 - I'm sorry, but I'm rehearsing.\\
272 - Yes, sir, I know.\\
273 - But nobody's allowed in here during
rehearsals.\\
274 - Well, I know, I know, but, uh, well,
we don't have much time.\\
275 - We don't?\\
276 - Uh, no. No, you see, it's like this,
Mr. Johnson.\\
277 - Uh... my name is Lucy Ricardo and...\\
278 - and my husband is Ricky Ricardo and
he's in the movies, too,\\
279 - or at least he will be real soon,\\
280 - so we're all showbiz folks\\
281 - and it isn't like...
it isn't like\\
282 - some stranger coming up to you on the
street and asking a favor\\
283 - and, uh, we really don't have much
time.\\
284 - Haven't I seen you somewhere before?\\
285 - Oh, no, that's impossible.\\
286 - Now, look, Mr. Johnson, it's like
this:\\
287 - I have this friend from New York\\
288 - and I've been writing her from time
to time\\
289 - and-and, uh, you know how it is.\\
290 - I've been, I've been telling her
that, uh,\\
291 - well, that I know a lot of movie
stars.\\
292 - You know, anything to brighten up
their drab little lives.\\
293 - Well, this friend of mine from New
York is out here\\
294 - and, uh, I told her that I was
rehearsing with you\\
295 - this afternoon and she'll be here any
minute.\\
296 - Who's gonna be here any minute?\\
297 - Caroline Appleby.
Who do you think?\\
298 - You'll pardon me, madam, but you're
talking nutsy cuckoo.\\
299 - Oh, no, no, Mr. Johnson.
I'm not... no, no.\\
300 - I'm in a terrible jam.\\
301 - Now, I know this is a lot to ask,\\
302 - but I really do have a friend from
New York\\
303 - and she's coming right here to see me
rehearse with you.\\
304 - Please, couldn't I just do a few
steps with you?\\
305 - I'm sorry, that's out of the
question.\\
306 - Oh, please, Mr. Johnson!\\
307 - Please.\\
308 - I'll be eternally grateful.\\
309 - I'll, I'll, I'll go see your next
picture three times.\\
310 - I'll, I'll name my next child after
you if I have one.\\
311 - If I don't, I'll, I'll,\\
312 - I'll change the name of the one I
already have.\\
313 - Please?\\
314 - Will you please get up?\\
315 - I understand your problem and I'd
like to help you...\\
316 - Oh, thank you! Thank you!\\
317 - But I can't.\\
318 - Oh, Mr. Johnson...\\
319 - Please? Caroline will blab it all
over New York.\\
320 - Please say that I can do it.\\
321 - Please say you'll help me.\\
322 - Look, even if I say I would, uh...
uh...\\
323 - you don't know any of my routines\\
324 - and I don't have the time to...\\
325 - Oh, oh, but I do.\\
326 - I've seen your show 14 times.\\
327 - Really?\\
328 - Yeah.\\
329 - Yes, I-I-I know how your, how your
partner makes the entrance.\\
330 - Look, I'll show you.\\
331 - See, she comes in here and you go...\\
332 - Da da da dee dee dee\\
333 - Da da da\\
334 - And then she waits for you to sing\\
335 - and I even know the patter in between\\
336 - that she sings in the song.\\
337 - No.
The little things\\
338 - that she says in between.\\
339 - Well, I'll be...
Yeah, well, can I do it, then?\\
340 - Well...\\
341 - Oh, please?\\
342 - I'll do it.\\
343 - Oh, thank you.\\
344 - LUCY: Ah, bless your heart.\\
345 - Now-- oh, there they are.\\
346 - Uh, come on in.\\
347 - Come in.\\
348 - It's all right, Ethel.\\
349 - LUCY: It's okay.\\
350 - This is my friend.\\
351 - VAN: Oh.\\
352 - Mrs. Appleby, Mr. Johnson.\\
353 - How do you do, Mrs. Appleby?\\
354 - Oh, how do you do, Mr. Johnson?\\
355 - And Mrs. Mertz.\\
356 - How do you do, Mrs. Mertz?\\
357 - Hello.\\
358 - Sit down, Ethel.
Sit down.\\
359 - LUCY: Now, uh, let's just get on with
the rehearsal.\\
360 - They won't bother us.\\
361 - Oh, uh, Lucy, Yes?\\
362 - I'm not sure about that next routine.\\
363 - You may have to tell me how it goes
again.\\
364 - You're not sure?\\
365 - Uh...\\
366 - Oh.\\
367 - Well, we-we-we come in,\\
368 - make the entrance, you know, from
both sides\\
369 - and then we just all...
together.\\
370 - That's it, that's it.\\
371 - Thank you.\\
372 - (piano playing "How About You?"
intro)\\
373 - I like New York in June\\
374 - June?\\
375 - How about you?\\
376 - Well, it's kinda hot, isn't it?\\
377 - I like a Gershwin tune\\
378 - Gershwin?\\
379 - How about you?\\
380 - Well, I like 'em, but I can't sing
'em.\\
381 - I like a fireside when the storm is
due\\
382 - Who's gonna empty the ashes-- you?\\
383 - I like potato chips\\
384 - Moonlight and motor trips\\
385 - How about you, dear?\\
386 - I'm wild about good books\\
387 - Good books?\\
388 - Can't get my fill\\
389 - What do you do, eat 'em?\\
390 - And Greta Garbo's looks\\
391 - Greta Garbo.\\
392 - Give me a thrill\\
393 - Did you see Camille?\\
394 - Holding hands in the movie show\\
395 - When all the lights are low\\
396 - May not be new\\
397 - Yeah, well...\\
398 - But I like it\\
399 - How about you?\\
400 - Well, now you're talking, boy.\\
401 - (Caroline laughing)\\
402 - Oh, Lucy, this has been an afternoon\\
403 - I will never forget.\\
404 - Oh, it was nothing.\\
405 - Oh, I just can't get over the way you
rub elbows\\
406 - with all the celebrities out here.\\
407 - (chuckles)
Well, that's true.\\
408 - Our elbows are practically raw.\\
409 - (laughing)\\
410 - And wait till the girls hear\\
411 - about you dancing with Van Johnson!\\
412 - You be sure and tell 'em.\\
413 - Oh, yes.\\
414 - And all those movie stars I just
missed seeing this afternoon.\\
415 - Mm...\\
416 - When do you think you'll see them
again?\\
417 - When are you leaving?\\
418 - Tonight.\\
419 - Oh, what a shame.\\
420 - We're having a big open house here
tomorrow afternoon.\\
421 - Maybe Charlie will let you stay.\\
422 - No... no, I don't think there's a
chance.\\
423 - These reservations were too hard to
get.\\
424 - Yeah.\\
425 - Well, it's a shame, Caroline,\\
426 - because practically every star in
town will be here--\\
427 - Cary Grant, mm... Walter Pidgeon and
Marlon and...\\
428 - Oh! Well, at least I got to meet Van.\\
429 - That's true, that's true.\\
430 - ETHEL: Yeah.\\
431 - Well, I guess I'd better say
good-bye.\\
432 - Okay.
It's just been wonderful.\\
433 - It's been nice seeing you, Caroline.\\
434 - I'm so glad you came out here.\\
435 - Oh, it was wonderful.\\
436 - (all talking at once)\\
437 - Hi, Caroline.
Hi.\\
438 - How are you?\\
439 - Hi, Caroline.
Good to see you.\\
440 - Oh, yeah.\\
441 - How's Charlie?\\
442 - Oh, he's just wonderful\\
443 - and I can't wait to see him\\
444 - to tell him about Lucy dancing with
Van Johnson!\\
445 - Isn't that nice?\\
446 - Well, bye, everybody.\\
447 - Bye.\\
448 - FRED: Good-bye.\\
449 - Good-bye.\\
450 - (door closes)\\
451 - LUCY: Oh, boy, I sure envy them going
to Honolulu.\\
452 - Sounds like an awful lot of fun,
doesn't it?\\
453 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, but-but- but-but
wait a minute here.\\
454 - There is something here that needs
'splaining.\\
455 - What needs 'splaining?\\
456 - What's this nonsense about you
dancing with Van Johnson?\\
457 - It's not nonsense.\\
458 - I did dance with Van Johnson.\\
459 - She's told so many of those wild
stories,\\
460 - she's beginning to believe them
herself.\\
461 - No! I was there and I saw her.\\
462 - Well, whatever Lucy's got, it's
catching.\\
463 - It's true. I've van...\\
464 - I danced with Van Johnson this
afternoon.\\
465 - Now look, honey.
Wait a minute.\\
466 - This is me, this is not Caroline.\\
467 - (phone ringing)\\
468 - You're talking to Ricky, remember?\\
469 - Vance with dance? What is that?\\
470 - She's gone completely...\\
471 - Hello.\\
472 - (chuckles)\\
473 - Hello, Van.\\
474 - How are you, boy?\\
475 - It's funny that you happened to call
now because...\\
476 - My wife?\\
477 - Yeah.\\
478 - Hello, Van.\\
479 - What?\\
480 - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.\\
481 - Who, me?\\
482 - Well, yes.\\
483 - Yes, I'll be right down.\\
484 - Bye.\\
485 - Van's partner is ill\\
486 - and he wants me to dance with him
tonight.\\
487 - You?\\
488 - Yes. I'm off to rehearsal.\\
489 - Oh, isn't this gonna be exciting?\\
490 - It'll be great for her.\\
491 - How do I look?\\
492 - Oh, grand, grand.
Oh, you look beautiful.\\
493 - How do you feel?\\
494 - You feel all right?\\
495 - Sure. I feel fine.\\
496 - Good. Now you're not gonna be nervous
or anything?\\
497 - Of course she's not nervous.\\
498 - Sure. Why should I be nervous?\\
499 - Oh, nothing, nothing.\\
500 - Uh, I guess you can, uh, jance,\\
501 - uh, dance just as well alone with him\\
502 - as out there in front of all those
people.\\
503 - You're more nervous than I am.\\
504 - Yes, I know it.\\
505 - All those people?\\
506 - Yeah.\\
507 - Oh, now, Lucy, don't pay any
attention to Fred.\\
508 - He doesn't make any sense.\\
509 - The whole world's out there!\\
510 - Oh, now, honey...\\
511 - RICKY: Honey!\\
512 - I've never seen so many people.\\
513 - Everything all right?\\
514 - Yeah, but-but there're all those
people out there.\\
515 - So what? What's the difference?\\
516 - What's the matter?
What happened?\\
517 - Oh, thanks to bigmouth Mertz,\\
518 - she's suddenly discovered there's a
big crowd out there.\\
519 - So what, honey?\\
520 - Well...\\
521 - You don't have to worry about the big
crowd.\\
522 - Now, look, honey, let me tell you
something.\\
523 - Just-just think about this just like
it was a rehearsal.\\
524 - You just go...\\
525 - When you start dancing, you forget
about those people.\\
526 - Sure.\\
527 - Dancing is just dancing.\\
528 - Just like a rehearsal?\\
529 - Just like a rehearsal, honey.\\
530 - Oh, look.
Isn't that beautiful?\\
531 - Oh, yes, you look lovely.
Oh, yeah.\\
532 - Yeah. You look nice and everything.\\
533 - Sure, don't worry about it. You can
do it.\\
534 - Okay.\\
535 - Hi, Van.	Well...\\
536 - you all set, Lucy?
Yeah.\\
537 - We're on in two minutes.\\
538 - Okay.\\
539 - Lucy's saving my life tonight, you
know.\\
540 - It's a sellout. It's the biggest
crowd they've ever had.\\
541 - That's right.\\
542 - Biggest crowd they've ever had!\\
543 - Yeah, that's all right, honey.\\
544 - Biggest crowd they've ever had.\\
545 - Honey, now, look, you'll be all
right.\\
546 - I can't do it, honey.
Yes, you can.\\
547 - You go to your table, I'll take care
of her.\\
548 - Honey, I haven't had enough
rehearsal, I can't do it.\\
549 - I haven't had enough rehearsal,
honey.\\
550 - Honey, it's all right.\\
551 - I only had a chance to go through it
twice.\\
552 - I'm telling you, you have to think
it's just about...\\
553 - I can't.\\
554 - Come on, I'll help you.
I can't, honey.\\
555 - I'll help you there.
You've got to go on.\\
556 - Honey, I can't.\\
557 - Honey, it's just like it was a
rehearsal.\\

\subsection {Episode 28: Lucy and Harpo Marx}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know all about
it,\\
3 - but there is nothing that I can do.\\
4 - Oh, Ricky, you don't understand what
this means to me.\\
5 - I understand perfectly.\\
6 - You do not or you couldn't just stand
there\\
7 - and see me suffer like this.\\
8 - If Caroline Appleby comes here this
afternoon\\
9 - and I don't have some movie stars\\
10 - here to meet her, my name is mud.\\
11 - Well, it's all your fault.\\
12 - You wrote her all those letters,\\
13 - telling here that you were hobnobbing
with movie stars.\\
14 - Now she's in town and you can't
produce them.\\
15 - So why did you have to write all
those bragging letters?\\
16 - It was perfectly legitimate.\\
17 - It made my letters more interesting,
more readable.\\
18 - The awful thing is, Caroline sneaking
into town like this.\\
19 - Sneaking into town?\\
20 - She's on her way to Hawaii.\\
21 - Yeah, well, she planned this whole
trip just to show me up.\\
22 - Well, I'm sorry.\\
23 - You're always telling people stories
that are not true.\\
24 - I'm going to the pool.\\
25 - Just a minute.\\
26 - Yes?\\
27 - Ricky, I'm not asking for much.\\
28 - All I want is a half a dozen movie
stars\\
29 - for a couple of hours.\\
30 - Now, if you can't do this simple
little thing for me, I'll...\\
31 - I'll kill myself.\\
32 - Kill yourself?\\
33 - Yes.\\
34 - Well, you got a lovely day for it.\\
35 - Oh!\\
36 - Hi. I just saw Ricky leave.\\
37 - Any luck?\\
38 - No.\\
39 - How would Harpo Marx be?\\
40 - Wonderful! Get him!\\
41 - Wait a minute. I didn't say I could
get him.\\
42 - Oh, fine.\\
43 - Now, he's appearing at a luncheon
here today\\
44 - at the hotel, and maybe we could get
him to drop by.\\
45 - Oh, sure, maybe we could get Princess
Margaret\\
46 - to fly over for tea.\\
47 - You never know unless you ask.\\
48 - Well, all right.\\
49 - You run and ask Harpo, I'll call
Princess Margaret.\\
50 - Okay.\\
51 - Oh...\\
52 - It just doesn't make sense, Ethel.\\
53 - Why should he want to do us a favor?
He doesn't even know us.\\
54 - I guess you're right.\\
55 - Well, all we can hope is that
Caroline loses her glasses again\\
56 - and can't find the hotel.\\
57 - Hey, wait a minute!\\
58 - What?\\
59 - Caroline can't see a foot in front of
her face\\
60 - without her glasses, can she?\\
61 - No.\\
62 - What if we could get her glasses away
from her?\\
63 - And?\\
64 - What are you doing?\\
65 - I was just trying to see if I was
real nearsighted,\\
66 - if maybe you couldn't pass for
Marilyn Monroe.\\
67 - Yeah?\\
68 - Yeah. Pull your hair down over one
eye.\\
69 - Now walk like Marilyn.\\
70 - Oh, no, nobody's that nearsighted.\\
71 - Thanks a lot.\\
72 - Hey, that magic shop up on the
boulevard\\
73 - sells masks that look like movie
stars.\\
74 - Maybe if you wore a mask...\\
75 - I am not wearing any hot rubber mask
all afternoon.\\
76 - All right, then I will.\\
77 - Oh, you can't get away with wearing a
mask.\\
78 - I could if I got her glasses off her.\\
79 - And how are you gonna do that?\\
80 - Well, let's see, uh...\\
81 - When Caroline comes in, uh...\\
82 - (chuckling): Oh, hi, Caroline.\\
83 - Oh... I'm terribly sorry.\\
84 - Or, uh...\\
85 - Oh, Lucy, why don't you just shoot
her\\
86 - when she walks through the door?\\
87 - Then you won't have to bother about
getting the masks.\\
88 - Well, come on, we'll go get the masks
right away.\\
89 - We can figure out how to get her
glasses off later, huh?\\
90 - Oh...\\
91 - Hi. Caroline isn't here yet, huh?\\
92 - No.\\
93 - Listen, you didn't lock your door,
did you?\\
94 - No. I got the door all open\\
95 - and I got your mother to take the
baby\\
96 - to the zoo for the afternoon\\
97 - and I got your costumes all laid out
on the bed\\
98 - just waiting for you to get in 'em.\\
99 - Okay. Now, the important thing for
you to remember\\
100 - is that you have to keep Caroline
real busy\\
101 - while I'm changing from one outfit to
the other.\\
102 - I know.\\
103 - Now, let's see.\\
104 - When I got the Harpo Marx outfit on,\\
105 - I don't have to talk,\\
106 - so I don't have to worry about that.\\
107 - Now, when I've got the other...\\
108 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
109 - There she is.\\
110 - Well...\\
111 - Hi, Lucy, how are ya?
Hi, Ethel!\\
112 - Any stars here yet?\\
113 - Oh, no, not yet, dear.\\
114 - Oh, I can just hardly wait.\\
115 - Who do you suppose will come by?\\
116 - Well, like I told you--\\
117 - Clark, Bing and Gary will be here\\
118 - and, uh, Ronnie and Bonita will...\\
119 - Oh, no. No, Ronnie and Bonita were
here last week.\\
120 - They probably won't drop in again
this week.\\
121 - Oh.\\
122 - Uh, but Harpo Marx is staying in the
hotel.\\
123 - He said he might come up.\\
124 - Oh, he's one of my favorite funny
men.\\
125 - Well, good, and you never can tell
who else might drop in.\\
126 - Caroline, your glasses are all
smudged.\\
127 - I want you to be able to see the
movie stars real good.\\
128 - You'd better let me clean them for
you. What's that?\\
129 - Isn't that a wonderful idea?\\
130 - I bought it when I lost my glasses.\\
131 - That will never happen to me again.\\
132 - No, these are clear.\\
133 - I can see real good.\\
134 - Oh, chocolates, mmm.\\
135 - Caroline, dear...\\
136 - Yeah.\\
137 - Uh, just how bad are your eyes\\
138 - without your glasses?\\
139 - (chuckling): Oh, are you kidding,
Lucy?\\
140 - I can't see a thing.\\
141 - Oh, come now.\\
142 - No, really, I can't.\\
143 - Oh, I don't believe that.\\
144 - Well...\\
145 - Well, take them off.
Let me test you.\\
146 - Well, all right, but you'll see.\\
147 - I just can't see a thing.\\
148 - Oh, I don't believe it.
What does that say?\\
149 - Uh...
oh, I can't see that.\\
150 - Yeah, well, try.
Come on, try.\\
151 - Uh... well...\\
152 - No, I can't make that out.\\
153 - Oh, my...
Oh, you're really blind, girl.\\
154 - I told you, oh, it's awful.\\
155 - Why, that I don't believe, for
heaven's sake.\\
156 - You know, I heard people say\\
157 - that they couldn't see without their
glasses...\\
158 - ...letters this high, you know.\\
159 - What's the matter, dear, lose
something?\\
160 - Well, my glasses-- th-they're gone.\\
161 - Why, they couldn't be.\\
162 - They're hanging right around your...\\
163 - Well, for heaven's sake, they are
gone.\\
164 - Oh...\\
165 - Now, they couldn't have just
disappeared.\\
166 - ETHEL: Oh, they must be here
someplace.\\
167 - Ah, you kids look for the glasses.\\
168 - I got a lot to do before the gang
gets here.\\
169 - I got to go next door and borrow some
sugar.\\
170 - Borrow sugar?
In a hotel?\\
171 - Oh, well, we're just all one big
happy family here.\\
172 - Oh.\\
173 - I just don't understand it.\\
174 - They, they couldn't have simply
disappeared into thin air.\\
175 - Oh, I'm so sorry, honey.\\
176 - (sighing)\\
177 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
178 - (gasping): Ethel, you suppose that's
a movie star?\\
179 - I have a feeling it might be.\\
180 - Come in.\\
181 - Why, Gary.\\
182 - Who is it? Who is it?\\
183 - It's Gary Cooper.\\
184 - Oh!\\
185 - ETHEL: Hi, Gary.\\
186 - Howdy.\\
187 - I want you to meet a friend of mine,
Caroline Appleby.\\
188 - Oh, how do you do?\\
189 - Howdy, ma'am.\\
190 - Uh, can you stay awhile?\\
191 - Nope.\\
192 - You have to go?\\
193 - Yep.\\
194 - Right away?\\
195 - Yep.\\
196 - Oh, well, it was just awfully nice\\
197 - meeting you, Mr. Cooper.\\
198 - Yep.\\
199 - Thanks for dropping by, Gary.\\
200 - Yep.\\
201 - Thanks a lot.\\
202 - Yep.\\
203 - Come again.\\
204 - Yep.\\
205 - Oh!\\
206 - Oh, Coop's a doll.\\
207 - Too bad he couldn't stay.\\
208 - You'd have loved him.\\
209 - Gee, he looked so handsome, too.\\
210 - From what I could see.\\
211 - Gee, Gary Cooper.\\
212 - Oh, Ethel, where are those glasses?\\
213 - We met a lot of stars since we came
to Hollywood.\\
214 - You did?
(doorbell buzzing)\\
215 - Here's another one.\\
216 - Come in.\\
217 - Why, Clark!\\
218 - Who? Who?\\
219 - It's Clark Gable.\\
220 - Oh!\\
221 - ETHEL: Uh, Clark, can you stay for a
little while?\\
222 - Aw, you got a cold?\\
223 - Got a little laryngitis, baby.\\
224 - That's too bad.\\
225 - But I want you to meet a friend of
mine, Caroline Appleby.\\
226 - How do you do?\\
227 - Uh, bup-bup.\\
228 - You'll catch his cold.\\
229 - Well, who cares?\\
230 - Imagine me being able to tell the
girls back home\\
231 - that I caught a cold from Clark
Gable!\\
232 - Honey, I'm not going to let you catch
a cold...\\
233 - Now, Ethel, I want to meet...\\
234 - Now look what you did, you scared
him.\\
235 - Well, I'm sorry.\\
236 - I... I guess I was awfully rude,\\
237 - but I just couldn't help myself.\\
238 - Weren't you excited?\\
239 - Yeah.\\
240 - Clark Gable...\\
241 - Hi. Ha, ha!\\
242 - Lucy, where have you been?\\
243 - Do you know that Clark Gable and Gary
Cooper have been here?\\
244 - Yeah, I saw them down the hall,\\
245 - and they both thought you were
terribly attractive.\\
246 - Ha, ha!
Oh, really?\\
247 - Yeah. Clark said he'd never forgive
himself\\
248 - for having that terrible cold.\\
249 - Oh!\\
250 - He thought you were a doll.\\
251 - (laughing giddily)\\
252 - I'll be back.\\
253 - Hi, Rick. Swell day, huh?\\
254 - Oh, hi, Fred.\\
255 - You know, Fred, I'm beginning to feel
like a heel.\\
256 - What about?\\
257 - Well, you know, the way I acted with
Lucy today.\\
258 - I could have got a couple of actors\\
259 - to come over there and visit.\\
260 - Caroline would have been happy,\\
261 - Lucy would have been happy,\\
262 - and everything would have been all
right.\\
263 - I know she exaggerates,\\
264 - and she shouldn't tell all those
stories,\\
265 - but, uh... she has a good side to
her.\\
266 - Don't you think so, Fred?\\
267 - Huh?\\
268 - Come on, you haven't listened to a
word I said.\\
269 - I was telling you the way that I felt
about Lucy...\\
270 - (women screaming)\\
271 - (Harpo whistling)\\
272 - Harpo!\\
273 - Harpo Marx!\\
274 - Yeah, Babalu, Ricky, yeah.\\

283 - A woman? Hit?\\
284 - Oh, wom-wom-wom...

285 - Lots of women, yeah.\\

323 - You're playing at the women's club
benefit.\\
324 - Oh. What time are you going to play?\\
325 - (whistles)\\
326 - Turn, over.
Oh, it's over.\\
327 - You already played there.\\
328 - Oh, geez, isn't that too bad?\\
329 - The girls love it.\\
330 - The girls would have loved to see it.\\
331 - Hey, would you do me a favor? Huh?\\
332 - (laughing): No.\\
333 - No, I don't need any money.\\
334 - No.\\
335 - Let me tell you what it is.\\
336 - Lucy has a girlfriend of hers\\
337 - here from New York, see?\\
338 - And this girl is just dying to meet a
big movie star.\\
339 - Big star like you.\\
340 - Yeah! That's right.\\
341 - So, listen, Harpo.\\
342 - Would you do me a favor and-and go up
to Room 315\\
343 - and pay them a visit?\\
344 - (shrill whistle)\\
345 - Thank you!\\
346 - Oh, Ethel... Ethel, this has been the
most thrilling day.\\
347 - Imagine meeting Bing Crosby, and
Walter Pidgeon\\
348 - and Clark Gable and Gary Cooper all
in the same day!\\
349 - Do you think anyone else will drop
by?\\
350 - Oh, I have a feeling someone will.\\

360 - Pleased to meet you.\\
361 - Excuse me for staring, but I lost my
glasses.\\
362 - What a "catastrastrope"!\\
363 - Oh, Jimmy! Will you stay and have a
cup of tea?\\
364 - No, thanks, I got an appointment.\\
365 - Oh, that's too bad.\\
366 - Well, toodle-oo.\\
367 - And to you, too.\\
368 - Oh, it's just been a pleasure meeting
you, Mr. Durante.\\
369 - Good night, Mrs. Appleby,\\
370 - whoever you are.\\
371 - Oh, yeah!\\
372 - Oh, thanks a lot!
Come back again.\\
373 - Oh, Ethel, Ethel, this has been such
fun.\\
374 - I wouldn't have missed this for the
world.\\
375 - Well, it is kind of fun meeting the
movie stars\\
376 - and palling around with celebrities.\\
377 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
378 - (gasps)\\
379 - That must be another one.\\
380 - Oh, uh...
I doubt it, so soon.\\
381 - Why?\\
382 - Uh, why?\\
383 - Uh, well, uh, uh, movie stars usually
space themselves\\
384 - farther apart than this.\\
385 - But I'll see.\\
386 - That was fast.\\
387 - Uh, Harpo, I want you to meet my
friend, Caroline Appleby.\\
388 - Harpo Marx, how do you do?\\
389 - Oh!\\
390 - (laughing)\\
391 - Don't overdo it.\\
392 - (laughing)\\
393 - You know, Harpo, I've seen you chase
girls in movies,\\
394 - but you don't really do that, do you?\\
395 - (screaming and laughing)\\
396 - (whistling)\\
397 - (laughing uncontrollably)\\
398 - Did you bring your harp?\\
399 - No, he didn't.\\
400 - (whistling)\\
401 - You did?\\
402 - (whistling)\\
403 - You brought your harp?\\
404 - (whistling)\\
405 - That man is just a scream.\\
406 - I laughed so hard, I cried.\\
407 - Oh, I've got to fix my mascara.\\
408 - I'll fix my face before he gets back.\\
409 - Yeah, fix your face.\\
410 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
411 - Where's your harp?\\
412 - Huh? Where's Caroline?\\
413 - She's in there.\\
414 - Lucy?\\
415 - What?\\
416 - Weren't you just here as Harpo?\\
417 - No.\\
418 - You weren't?\\
419 - No.\\
420 - Then that Harpo really was Harpo!\\
421 - What are you talking about?\\
422 - The real Harpo Marx was just here.\\
423 - What would he be doing up here?\\
424 - I don't know, but he said he was
going to go get his harp.\\
425 - (doorbell buzzing)\\
426 - There he is!\\
427 - Go hide.\\
428 - Not in there.
Caroline's in there.\\
429 - Hide in the kitchen.
In the kitchen.\\
430 - (whistling)\\
431 - What?\\
432 - (whistling)\\
433 - Oh.\\

466 - Oh, Ethel!\\
467 - Oh, Caroline, here are your glasses.\\
468 - My glasses, oh!\\
469 - They were there on the floor all the
time.\\
470 - Oh, thank you! Aloha!\\
471 - Can I help you?\\
472 - Oh, yeah, good-bye!\\
473 - Bye!\\
474 - Oh, no!\\

477 - Oh, no!\\
478 - (horns honk four times in unison)\\
479 - Harpo!\\
480 - Oh!\\
481 - Oh, Harpo, who told you to come up
here?\\
482 - Babalu. Ricky! Oh!\\
483 - And Fred.\\
484 - Oh.\\
485 - ETHEL: Really?\\
486 - (Lucy laughing)\\
487 - (whistling)\\
488 - You characters are too late.\\
489 - What do you mean? What's the matter?
What happened?\\
490 - Caroline's already gone.\\
491 - Oh.\\
492 - Which one of you two is Harpo?\\

\subsection {Episode 29: Ricky Needs an Agent}
1 - ("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)\\
2 - Lucy, did you see this picture\\
3 - of Ricky in the paper?\\
4 - Yeah, I saw it.\\
5 - Lucy, did I leave my glasses here
last night?\\
6 - Yeah, Fred.
Right there.\\
7 - Well, you don't sound very excited.\\
8 - Ehh, "Ricky Ricardo Crowns Queen Of
The Automobile Show."\\
9 - That's the third one this week.\\
10 - Ricky's crowned more queens than the
Archbishop of Canterbury.\\
11 - Oh, I think it's a very good picture,
don't you, Fred?\\
12 - Yeah, this automobile queen's\\
13 - got a nice chassis.\\
14 - I meant the picture of Ricky.\\
15 - Ricky?\\
16 - Hey, here's a picture of Ricky, too.\\
17 - That's all, brother.\\
18 - What's wrong with this?\\
19 - Well, look.\\
20 - "Ricky Ricardo Dedicates New
Freeway."\\
21 - "Ricky Ricardo Opens Supermarket."\\
22 - "Ricky Ricardo Judges Dog Show."\\
23 - Well, publicity is mighty important.\\
24 - Yeah. Look at this.\\
25 - "Mammoth car wash opened."\\
26 - "Ricky Ricardo, left, tosses in first
soapy sponge."\\
27 - What's the matter with that?\\
28 - Well, they had to say he was on the
left\\
29 - so people could tell which one was
the sponge.\\
30 - Oh. (chuckling)\\
31 - Ah, let's face it, Ethel.\\
32 - You don't win Academy Awards\\
33 - by patting poodles on the head and
crowning queens.\\
34 - I don't think that studio\\
35 - is ever gonna give him a picture.\\
36 - Oh, sure they are.\\
37 - Well, it has been a long time.\\
38 - Now, what does Ricky think about it?\\
39 - Oh, the poor thing hasn't got time to
think.\\
40 - He's so busy hopping from one
publicity stunt to the other.\\
41 - Where's Peter Rabbit now?\\
42 - He has to dance with 100 young
college girls.\\
43 - Can you think of anything worse than
that?\\
44 - Yeah, I can think of a couple of
things.\\
45 - Well, this just can't go on.\\
46 - This is not the way to...\\
47 - LUCY: Oh, here he is.\\
48 - ETHEL: Hi, Rick.\\
49 - Hi, Rick.\\
50 - Hi, everybody.\\
51 - LUCY: Hi, dear.
How did everything go?\\
52 - All right, I guess.\\
53 - Ricky, did you really have to dance
with a hundred girls?\\
54 - That's what they told me.
I lost count sometime ago.\\
55 - Aw, he's been dancing since 10:00
this morning.\\
56 - Honey, honey, come on.	      Let's
dance.\\
57 - No, now, honey, stop that.\\
58 - Come now, now, just sit down there.\\
59 - Come on now, sit down.\\
60 - Poor boy.\\
61 - Honey, I've just been going through
your scrapbooks\\
62 - and suddenly I got a very objective
picture\\
63 - of just what's been happening to you\\
64 - since you came to Hollywood.\\
65 - Yeah?\\
66 - This is the last\\
67 - publicity stunt you are going to do.\\
68 - It is?\\
69 - Yes. I've made up my mind.\\
70 - I'm putting your foot down.\\
71 - Well, pick it up again\\
72 - because I'm under contract to the
studio, you know.\\
73 - They're paying my salary every week.\\
74 - Yeah.\\
75 - He has to do what they say.\\
76 - That's right.\\
77 - Besides, they've been in the picture
business a long time.\\
78 - They know what's good for me.\\
79 - Well, I've been in the Ricky Ricardo
business a long time\\
80 - and I know what's better for you.\\
81 - Look, honey, I don't like it either,
but what am I gonna do?\\
82 - What can he do?\\
83 - I'll tell you what he can do.\\
84 - He can march himself right out there\\
85 - and demand that they give him a
picture to star in.\\
86 - And suppose they don't?\\
87 - You tell them they have to give you a
picture or...\\
88 - or, uh... or, uh...\\
89 - Hmm...\\
90 - Or... or what?\\
91 - Or else.\\
92 - Or else what?\\
93 - Oh, you keep out of this.\\
94 - Can't you just say, "You give me a
picture or else"\\
95 - and let them worry?\\
96 - Well, honey, now, look, why don't you
just forget it, huh?\\
97 - I feel better if I know that\\
98 - you're not worrying about my career.\\
99 - I'm awful tired.\\
100 - I'm going to go lie down for a while.\\
101 - FRED: Okay.\\
102 - ETHEL: Take a hot bath, honey.\\
103 - Yeah, something.\\
104 - Honestly, I don't know what's
happened to him.\\
105 - Forget it, Lucy. The studio knows
what's best for him.\\
106 - They do not. They're letting a great
talent\\
107 - slip through their fingers.\\
108 - If only I could get Ricky to do
something about it.\\
109 - Well, what do you want him to do?\\
110 - Walk in and say, "you'd better use me\\
111 - because my wife thinks I'm very
talented."\\
112 - Well...\\
113 - Well, the trouble is that\\
114 - Ricky hasn't got an agent\\
115 - to go in and fight for him.\\
116 - Fred, when will you ever learn to
keep your big mouth shut?\\
117 - Now, what did I do?\\
118 - ETHEL: You just lit a fuse\\
119 - that may lead to the biggest
explosion we've seen yet.\\
120 - An agent!\\
121 - Of course that's what he needs.\\
122 - Somebody to go in there and tell them
how good he is\\
123 - and how many other offers he's had.\\
124 - FRED: But Ricky hasn't got an agent.\\
125 - He has now.\\
126 - Gee, I'm glad you gave me this idea,
Fred.\\
127 - What idea?\\
128 - The idea for this whole plan.\\
129 - What plan?\\
130 - This plan wou...\\
131 - What's the matter with you, Fred?\\
132 - Well, I'm just practicing my answers\\
133 - for when Ricky asks me if I know
anything about this.\\
134 - "Oh, what idea, Ricky?"\\
135 - "What plan are you talking about?"\\
136 - "Lucy who?"\\
137 - Oh, Fred.\\
138 - Lucy, I don't think you'd better
meddle in this.\\
139 - Now, now, look, Ethel, Ethel,
nothing's gonna go wrong.\\
140 - I'm just gonna go out there\\
141 - and light a fire under Dore Schary.\\
142 - Well, I hope he's wearing asbestos
britches.\\
143 - Texas-03311.\\
144 - Oh, now, Lucy...\\
145 - No...\\
146 - H-H-Hello, MGM?\\
147 - I'd like to speak to Dore...\\
148 - Oh. I just remembered, Dore Schary
knows me.\\
149 - Uh, yes?\\
150 - Um, um, I'd like to, uh, speak to the
vice president\\
151 - in charge of Ricky Ricardo, please.\\
152 - Ricky Ricardo.\\
153 - "Who is he?"\\
154 - He's one of your biggest stars.\\
155 - "Who is he?"\\
156 - Uh... yes.\\
157 - Yes, well, I'd like to discuss his
contract.\\
158 - Walter Riley? Thank you.\\
159 - Uh, hello, Mr. Riley.\\
160 - I'm calling for Miss McGillicuddy\\
161 - of the (muffled) Agency.\\
162 - Yeah, this is Miss McGillicuddy's
secretary.\\
163 - Yes, we just signed a new client, Mr.
Ricky Ricardo.\\
164 - Miss McGillicuddy would like to come
in\\
165 - and discuss his contract with you.\\
166 - Lucy, are you still here?\\
167 - Yeah. I thought Ricky would never
leave.\\
168 - I'm gonna be late for my appointment
with Mr. Riley.\\
169 - Well, your mother wants a little robe
for the baby.\\
170 - You know where they are, honey.\\
171 - Yep.\\
172 - Honey, I thought you'd left.\\
173 - Well, I went down to the car to get
my guitar.\\
174 - Oh.\\
175 - You're not going anyplace, are you?\\
176 - Hmm?\\
177 - You're not going anyplace, are you?\\
178 - Uh...no.\\
179 - RICKY: Oh, hi, hi, Ethel.\\
180 - Hi, Rick.\\
181 - Listen, I've got to sing at the
opening\\
182 - of a bowling alley this afternoon,\\
183 - so I thought maybe you...\\
184 - Will you listen to a song, see if you
think it's all right?\\
185 - Sure.\\
186 - Op-Opening of a bowling alley?\\
187 - Yeah.\\
188 - It's an old Spanish song, you know.\\
189 - Como un avanicar de calor real\\
190 - En el jardin azul de tu extravio\\
191 - Contremo las angustias musicales\\
192 - Se asoman tus pupilas el astillo...\\
193 - Oh, honey, that's just wonderful!\\
194 - Well, that's just the verse.
This is the chorus.\\
195 - Oh.\\
196 - Es que quieren volver\\
197 - Tus amores de ayer a inquiedarme\\
198 - Y me quieren robar el divino penar de
adorarte...\\
199 - Oh, ha, ha, ha! Oh.\\
200 - Pues que quieres vivir\\
201 - Y volver a sentir las al dia\\
202 - De manchar la esmeralda de tus ojos\\
203 - Ojos-- that's eyes, means eyes.\\
204 - Vida mia.\\
205 - Ha, ha!\\
206 - That's wonderful.\\
207 - Oh, that's wonderful, honey.\\
208 - They'll love it.    Yeah?\\
209 - Okay, well, thank you.\\
210 - Listen, uh, you want to come with me?\\
211 - Uh... no... no.\\
212 - No, it's such a lazy day.\\
213 - I'm just gonna loll around the house.\\
214 - Okay, well, I'll see you later.\\
215 - ETHEL: Okay, Rick.\\
216 - Good-bye, Ethel.\\
217 - So long.
Thanks for listening.\\
218 - Mm-hmm.
Yeah.\\
219 - You really liked it, huh?\\
220 - Oh, it was wonderful.\\
221 - It was wonderful, honey, yeah.\\
222 - Oh, my.\\
223 - Honey, see you later.\\
224 - (intercom buzzing)\\
225 - Yes?\\
226 - WOMAN: Mr. Riley, Ricky Ricardo's
agent,\\
227 - a Miss McGillicuddy is here.\\
228 - Ask her to come in, would you,
please, Miss Klein?\\
229 - Yes, sir.\\
230 - How do you do, Mr. Riley?\\
231 - How do you do, Miss McGillicuddy?\\
232 - Down, Riley.\\
233 - I do not believe that women in
business\\
234 - deserve any special privileges.\\
235 - As you say.\\
236 - Now then, let's get down to cases.\\
237 - Mr. Riley, just what does your
studio, uh,\\
238 - plan to do with my client?\\
239 - Well, you see...\\
240 - After all, he didn't come all the way
out to California\\
241 - just to crown queens and open
supermarkets, you know.\\
242 - Well, we understand all that.\\
243 - We're just trying to keep his name
before the public\\
244 - until we put him in a picture.\\
245 - And just when do you think that might
be, Mr. Riley?\\
246 - Well, to you tell the truth,\\
247 - we can't seem to find just the right
property...\\
248 - Uh-huh.\\
249 - Uh, you see, he's a little difficult
to cast.\\
250 - Not on Broadway, he isn't.\\
251 - What do you mean?\\
252 - Mr. Riley, I just flew in from New
York\\
253 - where a very famous team of producers\\
254 - have a big musical they are just
frantic to star Ricardo in.\\
255 - Famous team of producers?\\
256 - Yes. Of course, I can't reveal their
names,\\
257 - but, uh, Oscar and Dick are just wild
about the boy.\\
258 - They really want him?\\
259 - Unquestionably.\\
260 - But I said to them, "You can't have
him, Oscar,\\
261 - and neither can you, Dick."\\
262 - Well, this throws an entirely new
light on things.\\
263 - I thought it would.\\
264 - This could cause quite a stir around
here.\\
265 - I'm sure it could.\\
266 - I'd better call Mr. Schary about
this.\\
267 - I think you should.\\
268 - Uh, Mr. Schary, please.\\
269 - Hello, Dore.\\
270 - Uh, Walt.\\
271 - Say, uh, Ricky Ricardo's agent is in
here and...\\
272 - Well, he has one now.\\
273 - She's been telling me that Ricky has
an offer\\
274 - to star in a Broadway show.\\
275 - Well, that's the way I feel about it,
too.\\
276 - He's a great talent.\\
277 - We should have used him in a picture
long before this.\\
278 - Oh, I agree with you completely.\\
279 - I think it should be right away.\\
280 - All right, I'm sure she'll be
delighted.\\
281 - All right.\\
282 - Good-bye.\\
283 - Well, Miss McGillicuddy, I have great
news for you.\\
284 - Yes?\\
285 - Yes. We have decided to release Ricky
from his contract.\\
286 - What did you say?\\
287 - I say we have decided to release
Ricky from his contract.\\
288 - But I, uh... if, if...\\
289 - He's, uh... released?\\
290 - (chuckling): Surprised?\\
291 - Yeah.\\
292 - Boy, am I surprised.\\
293 - Well, I don't blame you.\\
294 - You know, we don't do this very
often,\\
295 - but we're very fond of Ricky\\
296 - and we don't want to stand in his
way.\\
297 - Yeah, well, then why, why, why, uh...\\
298 - He's... released?\\
299 - He's released.\\
300 - He's released.\\
301 - Well, Miss McGillicuddy,\\
302 - I certainly want to wish you a lot of
good luck.\\
303 - Yeah, well, I'll need it.\\
304 - I may be back in New York in time\\
305 - for the opening of his show.\\
306 - If I am, perhaps you can send me some
passes, eh.\\
307 - (chuckling): Yeah.\\
308 - Yeah...\\
309 - (sobbing)\\
310 - Well, thank you so much for dropping
in.\\
311 - Uh... M-M-Mr. Riley?\\
312 - Yes?\\
313 - See you at the opening.\\
314 - All right. Good-bye.\\
315 - Will you come in, please, Miss Klein?\\
316 - Yes, Mr. Riley?\\
317 - Mr. Riley, I've been thinking it over\\
318 - and I can't do this to you.\\
319 - How do you mean?\\
320 - Well, uh, look at it this way.\\
321 - Uh, you release Ricky from his
contract,\\
322 - he goes to Broadway\\
323 - and becomes a tremendous success.\\
324 - And then Metro buys the film rights
to the musical\\
325 - and they want Ricky to play the lead.\\
326 - Naturally, since, uh, Ricky has
become such a huge success,\\
327 - I have to demand a huge salary.\\
328 - Then someone remembers that he was
under contract to you\\
329 - and he was released.\\
330 - They demand to know who released him\\
331 - and every finger points to you,
Walter Riley.\\
332 - They fire you immediately.\\
333 - And no other studio will hire such a
dunce.\\
334 - You become a penniless bum.\\
335 - Now, I don't want to have to go
through life,\\
336 - knowing that I was responsible for
making you, Walter Riley\\
337 - end up in the gutter.\\
338 - I appreciate your concern, but I'm
afraid\\
339 - I'll just have to take that chance,
Miss McGillicuddy.\\
340 - Good-bye.\\
341 - He's released, huh?\\
342 - Yes.\\
343 - Good-bye, Miss McGillicuddy.\\
344 - Bye.\\
345 - Come in, Miss Klein.\\
346 - Yes, sir?\\
347 - Mr. Riley...\\
348 - Mr. Riley, you're doing lots of
remakes.\\
349 - Why don't you take one of your big
hits\\
350 - and do it over for Ricky?\\
351 - Tailor it for him.\\
352 - Well...\\
353 - Like, uh...
I'm afraid not.\\
354 - Like Gone With The Cuban Wind?\\
355 - I'm afraid not.\\
356 - Or, uh, It Happened One Noche?\\
357 - I'm afraid not.     Afraid not.\\
358 - Well, it was just a thought.\\
359 - How about Seven Brides For Seven
Cubans?\\
360 - No.\\
361 - The Ricardos of Wimpole Street?\\
362 - No, thank you.\\
363 - All right, Miss Klein.\\
364 - Andy Hardy Meets a Conga Player?\\
365 - Lock it. Lock it.\\
366 - Take a letter, will you, please?\\
367 - Yes, sir.\\
368 - Uh, it's to A.J.\\
369 - Uh... Dear A.J.:\\
370 - Regarding your visit here to us next
month\\
371 - to discuss plans for the coming year,\\
372 - I have already set up meetings for
you\\
373 - with the heads of the various
departments\\
374 - and arranged a press party for you.\\
375 - Dore wants you and your wife to spend
the weekend...\\
376 - Mr. Riley!\\
377 - (screaming)\\
378 - How about Ricky...
Ricky, Son Of Flicka?\\
379 - A... A Streetcar Named Ricardo?\\
380 - Three Cubans In A Fountain?\\
381 - Uh...\\
382 - Meet Me In St. Ricky?\\
383 - Now, then...\\
384 - Arsenic And Old Ricky?\\
385 - ETHEL: Well, Lucy, did you...?\\
386 - What happened?\\
387 - Ooh, look how pale she is.\\
388 - FRED: Look at her eyes.\\
389 - She looks like a frightened horse.\\
390 - Lucy?\\
391 - Lucy, I can't stand it.\\
392 - What happened?\\
393 - Are they gonna put Ricky in a
picture?\\
394 - FRED: Are they just gonna keep on
like they're going now?\\
395 - ETHEL: Well, there's no other
alternative, is there?\\
396 - What?\\
397 - They released him from his contract.\\
398 - Oh, no! 	    Oh, no!\\
399 - Oh, Lucy, when Ricky finds out you
got him fired,\\
400 - he'll kill you!\\
401 - If I could only be sure that's all
he'll do.\\
402 - How did this happen, Lucy?\\
403 - Well, I... I went in to talk to Mr.
Riley\\
404 - and I told him that-that Ricky had a
big musical on Broadway\\
405 - and he called Dore Schary.\\
406 - And they said they didn't want to
stand in his way\\
407 - (blubbering): and they released him
from his contract!\\
408 - Oh, Lucy, what are you gonna do?\\
409 - (snuffling): I don't know.\\
410 - Oh, honey.\\
411 - (sniffling)\\
412 - I thought maybe I'd dye my hair black\\
413 - and move to Mexico.\\
414 - But first I'm gonna swim to Catalina\\
415 - to throw him off the scent.\\
416 - Oh, honey...\\
417 - There's just one thing I can do,
Ethel.\\
418 - What?\\
419 - I'm just gonna have to face him with
what I've done.\\
420 - Oh, you know Ricky's temper.\\
421 - Yeah, we've met.\\
422 - Well, you're gonna meet again.\\
423 - I don't want to be here for the
reunion.\\
424 - I've done a terrible thing.\\
425 - I've ruined his career.\\
426 - Anything he does to me, I deserve.\\
427 - Oh, now, honey.\\
428 - For 14 years Ricky's been\\
429 - trusting, devoted, understanding\\
430 - and what have I been?\\
431 - Thoughtless, selfish, meddlesome\\
432 - bungling, scheming, conniving\\
433 - eh...\\
434 - Irritating,\\
435 - headstrong,\\
436 - obnoxious,\\
437 - self-centered...\\
438 - Fred!\\
439 - It's all right, Ethel.\\
440 - Let him alone. He's right.\\
441 - Well, as long as it's open season,\\
442 - how about petty, childish, stubborn,\\
443 - vain...\\
444 - All right, let's not get carried
away.\\
445 - What are we standing here for?\\
446 - Ricky will be here any minute.\\
447 - Come on, you'd better hide in our
room.\\
448 - Yeah, come on.
No, uh-uh. No, uh-uh.\\
449 - Come on.
Come on now, honey.\\
450 - You can leave him a note\\
451 - and then come back when the storm
blows over.\\
452 - No, I'm gonna stay right here and
face him.\\
453 - What, with a chair and a whip?\\
454 - We're not gonna let you do it. Now
come on!\\
455 - You'd better come with us.\\
456 - No, I'm not.\\
457 - It is for your own good.\\
458 - Come on now, honey.\\
459 - Hi, everybody!\\
460 - ETHEL: Hi!\\
461 - Oh, um, Uh, Rick, uh, Lucy, uh, uh...\\
462 - Uh, she...\\
463 - Ricky....\\
464 - Ricky, I have something to say to
you.\\
465 - Well, I'll see you later.\\
466 - So long, Rick.\\
467 - We have something we have to do.\\
468 - See you around.\\
469 - What's the matter with them?\\
470 - They don't want to watch, and I don't
blame them.\\
471 - Watch what?\\
472 - Give me a kiss?\\
473 - One last farewell kiss?\\
474 - What's the matter with you, honey?\\
475 - (stifled sob)\\
476 - Ricky...\\
477 - I went out to MGM today and got you
fired.\\
478 - What are you talking about?\\
479 - I went out to MGM today\\
480 - and pretended that I was your agent.\\
481 - You what?!\\
482 - Now you're getting it.\\
483 - I went out to MGM...\\
484 - I went out to MGM today\\
485 - and I and I and I said I was your
agent\\
486 - and that you were wanted for a big
Broadway musical\\
487 - and Dore Schary said they didn't
stand in your way,\\
488 - so they released you from your
contract\\
489 - and thanks to me, you don't work at
Metro anymore.\\
490 - (heaving)\\
491 - (fist slapping)
Whoa!\\
492 - (high-pitched growl)\\
493 - Well, you don't just stand there.\\
494 - Throw something!
Throw something!\\
495 - (growling)\\
496 - Yeah! Yeah!\\
497 - Here! Here! Here!\\
498 - (hollering)\\
499 - This is worse than the time\\
500 - you loused up my screen test!\\
501 - Yeah, yeah, it's worse\\
502 - than when we got arrested in
Tennessee!\\
503 - It was all my fault.	Yeah!\\
504 - Yeah, it's worse than\\
505 - when we were handcuffed together for
48 hours!\\
506 - Yeah!
Yeah!\\
507 - It's worse than when I loused up your
nightclub act...\\
508 - Yeah, yeah!\\
509 - Here, here, here.\\
510 - What's this for?\\
511 - I don't know, but smash it anyway,\\
512 - and I'll have one coming...\\
513 - All right!\\
514 - Give me some more!\\
515 - Give me some more!\\
516 - Here.\\
517 - Oh, no!
Here.\\
518 - (grunting)\\
519 - Ay, caramba!\\
520 - Ay, mira lo que me ha hecho!\\
521 - You feel better, honey?\\
522 - Ay, mira lo que me ha hecho!\\
523 - You feel better?
(grumbling)\\
524 - Don't you feel better, honey?\\
525 - Get it all out of your system.\\
526 - (angry growl)\\
527 - Ohh!\\
528 - Oh, boy. Oh...\\
529 - (muttering)\\
530 - Oh, boy.\\
531 - Gee. Ohh.\\
532 - He killed her and tried to hide\\
533 - her body under the couch!\\
534 - Oh, Lucy!\\
535 - No, I'm all right.\\
536 - Oh, thank heavens, you're alive!\\
537 - Yeah, not even hurt.\\
538 - He took his anger out on the
bric-a-brac.\\
539 - Where did he go?\\
540 - I don't know.\\
541 - Maybe he went out trying to get a job
wrecking houses.\\
542 - Well, at least it's all over.\\
543 - I'm not so sure.\\
544 - I feel that I'll have to live with
this for a long time.\\
545 - Oh, if only you hadn't gone out there
today.\\
546 - Yes, but I did.\\
547 - I have an idea.\\
548 - How can you stand there in the middle
of all this mess\\
549 - and utter those four horrible words,
"I've got an idea"?\\
550 - Now wait a minute.\\
551 - Wait a minute!\\
552 - Texas 03311.\\
553 - She's a cool one;\\
554 - she's returning to the scene of the
crime.\\
555 - Listen, they don't know that...\\
556 - Uh, Mr. Riley, please.\\
557 - They don't know I was the one that
was out there today.\\
558 - Hello, Mr. Riley.\\
559 - Mr. Riley, this is Mrs. Ricardo,
Ricky Ricardo's wife.\\
560 - Yes, Ricky wanted me to call you and
warn you about something.\\
561 - Yes, it seems there's some woman
going around town\\
562 - claiming that she's Ricky's agent,
and...\\
563 - She was in your office today?\\
564 - Well! How crazy can she be?!\\
565 - Oh, you don't say.\\
566 - Mr. Riley, Ricky doesn't have an
agent.\\
567 - No, she certainly is not, and as for
that nonsense\\
568 - about Ricky going to Broadway for a
big...\\
569 - Well... well, I-I know sh-she's been
going around saying that.\\
570 - Yes, Mr. Riley, Ricky is very happy
working at Metro\\
571 - and he wishes to continue there a
long, long time.\\
572 - He will, won't he?\\
573 - Oh, bless you, Mr. Riley!\\
574 - I mean, thank you.\\
575 - Bye.\\
576 - Bravo!\\
577 - Bravo!\\
578 - Housekeeper, please.\\

580 - Uh, we've had a little accident.\\
581 - Lucy, where are you?\\
582 - Here I am, honey, and have I got good
news for you.\\
583 - Yeah, it cost quite a bit, fixing the
place up.\\
584 - But it really doesn't matter
because...\\
585 - I'll say, it doesn't matter.\\
586 - What do you mean?\\
587 - Well, I got myself an agent, and he
already got me a job\\
588 - at another studio at three times the
money.\\
589 - Huh?\\
590 - You know, getting me out of that
Metro deal was\\
591 - the best thing you've ever done.\\
592 - Three times the money, imagine that.\\
593 - And not only that, but they're gonna
star me\\
594 - in four pictures in a row right away.\\
595 - Four pictures!\\
596 - Here. Here.\\
597 - Oh, I forgot something else, too.\\
598 - They're gonna give you a contract.\\
599 - (screaming)\\
600 - (screaming)\\
601 - Wait! Wait!
Hey! Hey!\\
602 - What's the matter?\\
603 - What are you laughing at?\\
604 - I was just kidding you, honey.\\
605 - I called Metro and they told me
everything was straightened out.\\
606 - Come here.\\
607 - Oh, Ricky!\\
608 - Oh, no!\\
609 - (laughing)
Oh, Ricky.\\

8 - Correct.\\
9 - Well, why can't I go with you?\\
10 - Give me one good reason.\\
11 - I don't want you there.\\
12 - Ricky, look.\\
13 - If you say I can go with you, I
promise I-I won't say a word.\\
14 - All I want to do is just sit and
drool at him.\\
15 - Honey, you won't even know I'm there.\\
16 - I'll be as quiet as a mouse.\\
17 - I won't eat very much, just a little
piece of cheese.\\
18 - I'll, I'll even pick up the check for
the whole lunch.\\
19 - How about that?\\
20 - No, thanks, sport.\\
21 - Oh, Ricky, please.\\
22 - Please. This is the opportunity of a
lifetime.\\
23 - Please say I can go with you.\\
24 - You may not go with me.\\
25 - Ricky Ricardo, can you look me in the
eye\\
26 - and tell me I cannot have lunch\\
27 - with Richard Widmark, my idol, my
dream man?\\
28 - You cannot have lunch with Richard
Widmark,\\
29 - your idol, your dream man.\\
30 - Would you like to try the other eye?\\
31 - Now, look, Lucy, let me try to get
this\\
32 - into that little thick skull of
yours.\\
33 - Now, I am not positively, absolutely
taking you\\
34 - along with me definitely.\\
35 - (sighing)\\
36 - Well, it finally happened.\\
37 - What has?\\
38 - I knew the day would come when you'd
go too far.\\
39 - I'm gonna punch you in the nose,
buster.\\
40 - What?!\\
41 - (grunting)\\
42 - Come on now. Come on now.\\
43 - Ricky!\\
44 - Ricky, come on now!\\
45 - Hey, hey...!\\
46 - What's going on?\\
47 - Nothing. Calm down, will you, Lucy?\\
48 - Calm down! Calm down!\\
49 - Lucy, what did he do?\\
50 - He's having lunch with Richard
Widmark at Romanoff's\\
51 - and he won't take me along.\\
52 - Let me at the dirty rat.\\
53 - Hey, hey, now.\\
54 - Never mind, Rocky, never mind.\\
55 - Honestly, I am never gonna tell you\\
56 - when I'm having lunch with anyone
again.\\
57 - You didn't tell me this time,
remember?\\
58 - Well, I'm never gonna have a
telephone\\
59 - with an extension again.\\
60 - You're just being mean.\\
61 - You know how much I want to meet him.\\
62 - Aw, Ricky, why don't you take her
along?\\
63 - What's the harm?\\
64 - I never thought I'd agree with these
two, Rick,\\
65 - but why don't you take her along?\\
66 - Well, well, well.\\
67 - It's very obvious that all of you are
gonna buyer me, so...\\
68 - "Buyer me"?\\
69 - You know what I mean.\\
70 - "Buyer me"?\\
71 - I think there is something that all
of you should know.\\
72 - Well, in these short three months\\
73 - that we've been out here,\\
74 - Lucy has become a Hollywood legend.\\
75 - Me, a Hollywood legend?\\
76 - Yes, that's right.\\
77 - When I'm out in the street,\\
78 - people point me out and say, "There
he goes.\\
79 - "That's the fellow\\
80 - that's married to that redheaded
screwball."\\
81 - Oh, they do not.\\
82 - And then the first thing they want to
know\\
83 - when they meet me: "Is it true\\
84 - "that she threw a pie at Bill Holden\\
85 - in the Brown Derby?"\\
86 - I told you, I did not throw that pie.\\
87 - The waiter bumped into me.\\
88 - Uh-huh, well, yeah.\\
89 - And then they want to know\\
90 - if she really sneaked into Cornel
Wilde's room\\
91 - dressed as a bellhop.\\
92 - Well, I... that...\\
93 - And the commotion that\\
94 - that orange that she had Robert
Taylor autograph for her\\
95 - at the Farmer's Market.    Now,
listen,\\
96 - there's a good, logical reason for
everything\\
97 - that's happened to me.\\
98 - Well, I'm sure that there is, honey,\\
99 - but I haven't got time to listen to
them now.\\
100 - So, uh, I'll see you later,
character.\\
101 - Yee-ee-ee.\\
102 - Yeah, I'll see you.\\
103 - I don't like that tone.\\
104 - You are thinking again.\\
105 - There's no law against my going to
Romanoff's, too,\\
106 - and perhaps dropping by your table
and delivering\\
107 - a cheery little hello	Lucy...\\
108 - to someone that I	Lucy...
think is real dreamy.\\
109 - Lucy!\\
110 - What?\\
111 - I want you to listen to me\\
112 - and I want you to listen very
carefully.\\
113 - If I as much as see your face in
Romanoff,\\
114 - I am gonna wrap you up in brown paper\\
115 - and mail you back to New York!\\
116 - And that's an ultimatum!\\
117 - (door slamming)\\
118 - An ultimatum?!\\
119 - Well, I'm not surprised.\\
120 - I am. I didn't think he knew how to
pronounce it.\\
121 - Oh, nuts.\\
122 - Hey, I know where you can go and be
surrounded\\
123 - by movie stars Where?	       all
afternoon.\\
124 - Take that bus trip we were reading
about,\\
125 - the one that goes through Beverly
Hills.\\
126 - Oh, I don't want to see the outsides
of their houses.\\
127 - I want to see them in person, up
close.\\
128 - That's right, you like to be within
pie-throwing range.\\
129 - Oh, Fred!\\
130 - Well, you two do what you like.\\
131 - I'm going to the ball game. Good-bye.\\
132 - Where's that pamphlet, tells about
that bus ride?\\
133 - Over here.\\
134 - Is this bus that tours the movie
stars' homes?\\
135 - Yes, ma'am, but we don't leave for a
few minutes yet.\\
136 - Oh, well, that's good 'cause we want
to get a good seat.\\
137 - Where's the best place to sit?\\
138 - You can see equally as well on either
side.\\
139 - Oh.\\
140 - Uh, this'll show you where we go.\\
141 - Your tickets, please?
Thank you.\\
142 - Let's sit here, Ethel.\\
143 - All right.\\
144 - I want to sit by the window.\\
145 - Why?\\
146 - 'Cause I'm right-handed.\\
147 - Oh.\\
148 - What's that got to do with it?\\
149 - Oh, move to the other side, Ethel.\\
150 - Well, look,		Why?\\
151 - when we go out Wilshire Boulevard,\\
152 - the La Brea Tar Pits and all these
buildings\\
153 - are on the left.
That's the best side. Go on.\\
154 - Okay.\\
155 - Ethel.\\
156 - You got two right hands?\\
157 - Come on.\\
158 - Thank you.\\
159 - Uh-oh.\\
160 - We'll miss The ocean if we stay on
this side.\\
161 - Now, look, Lucy...\\
162 - Come on, before somebody else\\
163 - gets on and takes that seat. Come on!\\
164 - Ethel...\\
165 - This seat is very comfortable.\\
166 - I can see fine.\\
167 - Ethel...\\
168 - This is just great.\\
169 - Clark Gable's house is on the left\\
170 - and so is Bob Hope's.\\
171 - Oh, Lucy, we're not gonna move again.\\
172 - You want to bet?\\
173 - Well, I'm sorry if we're bothering
you,\\
174 - but we paid our money for this trip\\
175 - and we want to see everything.\\
176 - I wish there was someplace we could
sit\\
177 - so we could see both sides.\\
178 - Oh, but there is.
Where?\\
179 - I could strap you onto the front of
the bus!\\
180 - Well! I don't see anything so funny
about that.\\
181 - Oh, I think you had it coming.\\
182 - Come on now, we can see things\\
183 - over there much better than over
here.\\
184 - I am not going to move.\\
185 - Oh, all right.\\
186 - You stay with the Pacific Ocean.\\
187 - I'll take Clark Gable and the La Brea
Tar Pits\\

364 - There's a swimming pool\\
365 - and a tennis court\\
366 - and a barbecue pit\\
367 - and a doghouse.\\
368 - (dog growling)
And a dog!\\
369 - (dog barking ferociously)\\
370 - Lucy, come on!\\
371 - Ethel...\\
372 - Come on! Come on!\\
373 - Get out of here, buster! Go on!\\
374 - Stop it! Now cut it out.\\
375 - The biggest dog you have ever seen.\\
376 - I guess he just wants to play, but...\\
377 - (growling)
Stay away.\\
378 - Now cut it out. Please, oh...!\\
379 - Lucy?\\
380 - Lucy, what happened?\\
381 - (dog barking)
Go...\\
382 - Go away now. Go on!\\
383 - Come on! Come on!\\
384 - Oh, no! He's got my shoe.\\
385 - Oh, Lucy, those are your good shoes.\\
386 - Is he chewing it up?\\
387 - No, but he swallowed it whole.\\
388 - Oh, no.\\
389 - Come on now. Come on.\\
390 - Ooh. Oh, no, no! Cut it out!\\
391 - (barking)
No, wait!\\
392 - (barking)
Oh, please.\\
393 - Ethel?\\
394 - Yeah?\\
395 - Ethel, there's no way to get back
over this wall.\\
396 - (gasps)\\
397 - Lucy, what are you gonna do?\\
398 - Well, now wait a minute, wait a
minute.\\
399 - My gosh, it's walled all around.\\
400 - There's no way out.\\
401 - Oh...\\
402 - For heaven's sake.\\
403 - Oh, listen.\\
404 - Yeah?\\
405 - Listen.\\
406 - Huh?\\
407 - The back door is open, and I'll sneak
in\\
408 - and I'll sneak through the house and
get out the front.\\
409 - You wait for me out there.\\
410 - Oh, you can't do that.\\
411 - It's the only way.
Now go-go on!\\
412 - (barking incessantly)
(yelling)\\
413 - (phone ringing)\\
414 - WOMAN: I'm coming!\\
415 - I'm coming.\\
416 - Mr. Widmark's residence.\\
417 - Oh, hi.\\
418 - No, I'm not busy.\\
419 - Mr. Widmark's off to the studio and
I've got nothing to do.\\
420 - What's new?\\
421 - No kidding?\\
422 - You really broke up with him?\\
423 - Tell me all about it.\\
424 - Oh.\\
425 - Really?\\
426 - You don't mean it.\\
427 - Oh.\\
428 - Oh, Fred. Oh, thank goodness you're
home.\\
429 - Listen, I'm in Beverly Hills, and
Lucy's in an awful mess.\\
430 - Never mind "what else is new."\\
431 - Now, listen, we got off of the bus\\
432 - in front of Richard Widmark's house\\
433 - because Lucy wanted to pick a
grapefruit\\
434 - that was growing in his backyard.\\
435 - So, she got up on the wall and she
tried to get it\\
436 - and she fell over the other side\\
437 - and then she told me that she
couldn't get out.\\
438 - So, she said for me to go around and
wait in front\\
439 - and that she would go through the
house and meet me out there\\
440 - and I've been standing out there for
an hour\\
441 - and she never did come out...\\
442 - Stop saying, "Madam, you've got the
wrong number!"\\
443 - Now, this-this is the worst part.\\
444 - Richard Widmark just drove by here\\
445 - and he had Ricky in the car with him\\
446 - and we've got to get Lucy out of
there.\\
447 - Now, I've got a plan.\\
448 - Oh.\\
449 - Oh, really?\\
450 - You don't mean it.\\
451 - Oh.\\
452 - Uh, say, listen, Mr. Widmark just
drove up.\\
453 - I've got to go now.
Good-bye.\\
454 - RICHARD: Come on in, Rick.\\
455 - RICKY: Hey, this is a lovely house.\\
456 - RICHARD: Uh, we sort of like it.\\
457 - We've lived here for quite a long
time now.\\
458 - From the hallway here, you can see
the living room.\\
459 - RICKY: Oh, yes, yes.\\
460 - RICHARD: Just beyond that is the
dining room\\
461 - and a little breakfast room.\\
462 - RICKY: Uh-huh.\\
463 - And, uh, right in here is the trophy
room.\\
464 - Oh, this is nice.\\
465 - Come on, I'll show you the pool.\\
466 - RICKY: Okay. I'd love to see the
backyard.\\
467 - Now, there's the pool right over
there.\\
468 - Oh, isn't that nice?\\
469 - Over there to the left, that's the
tennis court.\\
470 - Oh, yeah. You play a lot of tennis?\\
471 - Oh, not too much. I'm getting a
little old for that.\\
472 - RICKY: I'm taking up golf, yeah.\\
473 - RICHARD: Oh, I like golf better.
Easier, easier.\\
474 - I got some fruit trees in the back
there, too.\\
475 - (dog barking)
Uh-huh.\\
476 - Got some oranges and lemons.\\
477 - Hello there, Cap.
How are you?\\
478 - Oh, isn't he a beautiful dog!
Been a good boy?\\
479 - Yeah, he's a big one.\\
480 - Yes, this room is really my favorite.\\
481 - Well, I don't blame you.
This is really something.\\
482 - Say, I didn't know that you were
interested in big game hunting.\\
483 - Oh, yeah. I got started on it\\
484 - when I was on location in Africa.\\
485 - Oh, yeah.\\
486 - I got that water buffalo here.\\
487 - Isn't that beautiful?\\
488 - You know, I had an uncle who combed
his hair just like that.\\
489 - (laughing)\\
490 - Say, Rick, did you ever shoot a gun?\\
491 - Well, I won a Kewpie doll at Coney
Island once.\\
492 - Well, I was hoping to get some
shooting in\\
493 - last summer in Germany.\\
494 - I made a picture there called A Prize
Of Gold,\\
495 - but I was too busy.\\
496 - Oh, yeah, you know, a lot of people
told me that\\
497 - that's a great picture.\\
498 - Well, it's nice to know that\\
499 - people are saying something about it
anyway.\\
500 - Hey, you see those two heads there?\\
501 - What are those?\\
502 - Those are boars' heads.\\
503 - Wow!\\
504 - Got those down at Borneo.\\
505 - Look at those teeth.\\
506 - Yeah. Aren't they something, though?\\
507 - Mm-hmm.
You seen your dentist lately?\\
508 - A couple of years ago, I was over in
India\\
509 - Uh-huh.
and I got this tiger.\\
510 - Oh, yeah.\\
511 - What do you think of this?\\
512 - RICHARD: I don't know what he's
laughing at.\\
513 - What are those over there?\\
514 - Oh, hose are giant sable antelope
antlers.\\
515 - They're sharp.\\
516 - Say, Ricky...\\
517 - Ricky, I've been meaning to ask you:\\
518 - These stories I've been hearing about
your wife, are they true?\\
519 - RICKY: Oh, yeah.\\
520 - I mean, did she really throw a pie at
Bill Holden?\\
521 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
522 - She did, huh?\\
523 - Yeah, I've been waiting for you to
ask me that.\\
524 - You were?\\
525 - Um... you know that story about her\\
526 - throwing a pie at Holden at the Brown
Derby?\\
527 - RICHARD: Yeah, that's the one I
heard.\\
528 - And also that thing about she
sneaking\\
529 - into Cornel Wilde's room...\\
530 - Yeah, I heard about it.\\
531 - That's true.\\
532 - And then she met Taylor\\
533 - at the Farmer's Market one day\\
534 - and she asked him to sign his orange.\\
535 - I heard rumors about that.\\
536 - I'll tell you...
You know something?\\
537 - She's a very nice girl,\\
538 - but, uh, it's just that something
happens to her\\
539 - when she gets close to a movie star.\\
540 - Yeah, I got you.
I got you.\\
541 - As a matter of fact,\\
542 - she wanted to join us in our luncheon
today.\\
543 - What?\\
544 - No, don't worry about it.\\
545 - She's not within ten miles of here.\\
546 - Well, that's good.
From the way she sounds,\\
547 - I might end up with another head on
my wall.\\
548 - Listen, Ricky.
Yeah?\\
549 - Have you ever seen a real elephant
gun?\\
550 - No.\\
551 - Well, take a look at this.
Oh.\\
552 - I got this about five years ago down
in Nairobi.\\
553 - RICKY: Isn't that a beautiful thing?\\
554 - That's got a kick like ten...\\
555 - (jabbering)\\
556 - All right, Cap, I'll take it from
here.\\
557 - Please, put that...\\
558 - Well...\\
559 - Is, uh, this, uh...?\\
560 - The pie-thrower herself, yes.\\
561 - How are you?\\
562 - Please, I can explain. It's all very
normal and natural.\\
563 - I-I can tell you just how it
happened,\\
564 - but put that down first, please.\\
565 - Huh?\\
566 - Well, now, I don't know about that.\\
567 - It'd be such a public service to
Hollywood.\\
568 - Yeah. You might even get a special
Oscar.\\
569 - Ricky!\\
570 - Thank you.	    Go ahead.\\
571 - No, no, no, please! Please!\\
572 - I can explain.\\
573 - All right, go ahead.\\
574 - Go ahead.\\
575 - Explain?\\
576 - Yeah, go ahead and explain.\\
577 - Well...\\
578 - Sit down, Cap. You might as well
listen to this.\\
579 - Oh, you wouldn't believe it anyway.\\
580 - Go ahead and shoot.\\
581 - No, now, fellas!\\
582 - Well... look, it-it was this way.\\
583 - Uh, the whole thing wouldn't have
happened if I hadn't...\\
584 - hadn't got trapped inside your wall.\\
585 - Mm-hmm.
There's no way out of there.\\
586 - No.\\
587 - You'll be very happy to know\\
588 - that you're very well-protected, sir.\\
589 - Oh, thank you.\\
590 - Isn't nice to know?
Oh, yeah.\\
591 - And I... and I...\\
592 - Oh, by the way, I have a grapefruit\\
593 - I'd like you to autograph.\\
594 - May I?\\
595 - Be my guest.\\
596 - Thank you.\\
597 - No! Now, Ricky!\\
598 - You see, Mr. Widmark,\\
599 - uh, Ricky was going to have lunch
with you\\
600 - and he wouldn't let me come along,\\
601 - so Ethel and I took one of those bus
tours\\
602 - that goes all around the movie stars'
home...\\
603 - RICKY: Ethel...\\
604 - Ethel is a girlfriend.
Yes.\\
605 - Oh, I see.
A girlfriend from New York,\\
606 - and we went all around the movie
stars' homes\\
607 - and we went past your house and-and,
uh,\\
608 - we saw the grapefruit growing out
over the wall...\\
609 - So I-I-I sneaked through the house\\
610 - and I was intending to get out the
front\\
611 - and you came in, and-and I ran in
here\\
612 - and I tried to hide and that's all
there is to it.\\
613 - Well?\\
614 - Well, it sort of makes sense\\
615 - in a crazy mixed-up way.\\
616 - Oh, that's, that's the trouble with
her.\\
617 - It is?
Yeah.\\
618 - Uh, pardon me, Mr. Widmark,\\
619 - there's some people here from the
mental hospital.\\
620 - A mental hospital?\\
621 - Oh, there you are, Miss Bell!\\
622 - (Fred muttering)\\
623 - There you are, dear.\\
624 - No, no...\\
625 - We'll take you right back...\\
626 - All right, all right, everybody, hold
it!\\
627 - Oh, you don't understand.
This woman's very dangerous.\\
628 - Yes.\\
629 - Yeah, I know that.\\
630 - I've known that for a long time.\\
631 - She's very dangerous, yes,\\
632 - and he knows that she is my wife.\\
633 - Oh.		    Oh.\\
634 - Fred, Ethel, I'd like you to meet
someone, Mr....\\
635 - How do you do?
Oh, how...\\
636 - That's all right, Richard.\\
637 - These are my next-door neighbors.\\
638 - Hello.\\
639 - Hi.		  How do you do?\\
640 - Well, how convenient for you, Ricky,\\
641 - to live next door to a mental
hospital.\\
642 - Oh, no, now, these are just costumes.\\
643 - We wanted to get Lucy out of here\\
644 - before you found out she was Ricky's
wife.\\
645 - Oh, I see.\\
646 - RICKY: Isn't that simple?\\
647 - Yes, very simple.\\
648 - Ricky, uh, you must lead a very
interesting life.\\
649 - Yes, yeah, yeah, it's got its
moments, yeah.\\
650 - Well, I'll tell you, Dick,\\
651 - the way I look at it is this way:\\
652 - You know, everybody has a problem.\\
653 - Mm-hmm.\\
654 - You know, there are some people\\
655 - that have financial problems...\\
656 - Yeah.\\
657 - ...and then there are people\\
658 - that have health problems.\\
659 - Yeah.\\
660 - Everybody has something, you know?\\
