21 - Seems like just yesterday\\
22 - he was an adorable chubby-cheeked little boy\\
23 - catching a Frisbee on the beach in Santa Monica.\\
24 - Now he's a fuzz-faced buck private\\
25 - catching the clap from a whore in Tijuana.\\
26 - Hey, guys. What do you think?\\
27 - Oh, yummy.\\
28 - You look like a maitre d'in heaven.\\
29 - What's the occasion?\\
30 - It's Zoey's birthday.\\

44 - I mean, I love her, I love her daughter.\\
45 - Yeah, it's win-win for everybody.\\
46 - Gonna miss ya.\\
47 - Hey, I don't wanna get ahead of myself\\
48 - but...I was hoping you'd be my best man.\\
49 - Oh, uh...Walden\\
50 - I-I-I'd be honored to be the best man at your wedding.\\
51 - [laughing]\\
52 - What's so funny?\\
53 - You wouldn't be the best man\\
54 - at the Dinah Shore Golf Classic.\\
55 - [chuckling]\\
56 - Alright, you can be the maid of honor.\\
57 - Okay, I gotta go.\\
58 - Good luck with Zoey.\\
59 - Oh, thanks, but I mean\\
60 - come on.\\
61 - How about that? The kid's getting married.\\
62 - Yeah. Crazy, huh?\\
63 - If I looked like him, I wouldn't take myself off the market.\\
64 - - Is that so? - Oh, yeah.\\
65 - I'd be out there every night\\
66 - wearing my penis down to a nub.\\
67 - It would look like a golf pencil.\\
68 - Hey, a golf pencil does a lot of scoring, lady.\\
69 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\

82 - Zoey..\\
83 - ...my life...is so much better with you in it.\\
84 - Aw.\\
85 - The first time I saw you..\\
86 - ...it was like..\\
87 - ...fireworks.\\
88 - - Did you do-- - I did.\\
89 - And when I hear your voice..\\
90 - ...it's like music.\\
91 - Music.\\
92 - [whispers] Sorry.\\
93 - [guitar music]\\
94 - God, Walden.\\
95 - All this for my birthday?\\
96 - Not just for your birthday.\\
97 - You see, Zoey\\
98 - when a man...loves a woman..\\
99 - ...he can't keep his mind on nothin' else.\\
100 - Okay, I'm totally lost now.\\
101 - He'd give up all his comforts..\\
102 - ...and sleep out in the rain\\
103 - if she said that's the way it ought to be.\\
104 - Wait, that's from some song.\\
105 - No, no, not some song.\\
106 - A great song.\\
107 - Bolton, you're up.\\
108 -     When a man loves a woman    \\
109 -     He can't keep his mind on nothin' else    \\
110 -     He'd trade the world..    \\
111 - Get up, get up.\\
112 - Stop it.\\
113 - Zoey Hyde-Tottingham Pierce..\\
114 -     If she's bad he can't see it    \\
115 - ...will you do me the honor of becoming..\\
116 - ...Zoey Hyde-Tottingham Pierce Schmidt?\\
117 -     Turn his back on his best friend    \\
118 -     If he puts her down    \\
119 -     When a man loves a woman    \\
120 -     Deep down in his soul..    \\
121 - No. I'm sorry. I can't do it.\\
122 -     She can       \\
123 - Zoey!\\
124 -     When a man loves a woman..    \\
125 - Shut up, Bolton!\\
126 -     Men       \\
127 - So, after they get married\\
128 - I don't know what I'm going to do.\\
129 - Oh, Alan, don't be coy.\\
130 - If you want to come live with me, just ask.\\
131 - Can I come live with you?\\
132 - No.\\
133 - Oh, come on, mom, I'm gonna be homeless.\\
134 - Once he marries her, I'm gonna be living on the street.\\
135 - Try to pick a street in Beverly Hills\\
136 - so I can visit you.\\
137 - [doorbell rings]\\
138 - Does this guy belong to you?\\
139 - Michael Bolton?\\
140 - Hi, Alan.\\
141 - Uh, y-yes, b-bring him in.\\
142 - What happened?\\
143 - She said no.\\
144 - Oh, oh, Walden, I am so sorry.\\
145 - When I proposed, she just ran out of the restaurant.\\
146 - Now she won't return my calls\\
147 - or e-mails or texts.\\
148 - It's like she's ignorin' me\\
149 - across the entire digital spectrum.\\
150 - It's like she's Amish.\\
151 - So...you went out drinking\\
152 - and ended up picking up Michael Bolton?\\
153 - No.\\
154 - I hired him to sing while I was proposing.\\
155 - I should've gone with Josh Groban.\\
156 - Wait, you're gonna blame me for this?\\
157 - I'm gonna call her again.\\
158 - Oh, my stars, Michael Bolton.\\
159 - I have a vibrator named after you.\\
160 - Zoey, why won't you answer?\\
161 - Was it something I did?\\
162 - Was the ring not big enough?\\
163 - - Was it Bolton? - Hey!\\
164 - Okay.\\
165 - Screw it, I just can't sit around here.\\
166 - Come on, Bolton, let's go find her.\\
167 - I'm not gonna go looking for your girlfriend.\\
168 - Why don't you see if Groban's available?\\
169 - Hey, I bought and paid for your ass until ten o'clock.\\
170 - It's 10:01. So now you can kiss it.\\
171 - Fine, I'll just drive myself.\\
172 - Oh, no, no, hang on, hang on. You can't drive.\\
173 - I-I-I'll take you.\\
174 - See, you're a good friend.\\
175 - You're dead to me.\\
176 - I can't believe the things I do for money.\\
177 - You won't believe the things I'll do for free.\\
178 -     Men       \\
179 - I really, really think you ought to wait\\
180 - till tomorrow to do this.\\
181 - No, no.\\
182 - - I need to know why. - Uh-uh, not a good idea.\\
183 - See, i-it's like asking a woman why she won't sleep with you.\\
184 - You always hope that it's 'cause you're too big\\
185 - and you'll ruin her for other men.\\
186 - [knocking on door]\\
187 - But, no, it's usually 'cause she\\
188 - sobered up and got a good look at you.\\
189 - Oh, Walden. Ugh!\\
190 - Ugh! That's the sound they make.\\
191 - We need to talk.\\
192 - Can we do this tomorrow?\\
193 - Let me use a word that you're fond of.\\
194 - "No."\\
195 - Have you been drinking?\\
196 - Let me use a word that you're not fond of.\\
197 - Yes.\\
198 - She's right, Walden. You can come back tomorrow.\\
199 - No. I'm not leavin' until I get an answer.\\
200 - Oh, Walden, please.\\
201 - Zoey, I need an answer.\\
202 - Oh, it's complicated.\\
203 - No.\\
204 - Peeing with morning wood is complicated.\\
205 - True. That thing is like a Water Wiggle.\\
206 - Once, I shorted out a light socket in the ceiling.\\
207 - - I've done that. - Yeah.\\
208 - Saying yes to someone who loves you\\
209 - more than life itself\\
210 - is not complicated.\\
211 - Fine. Do you really want to know?\\
212 - I really want to know.\\
213 - Oh, hang on, hang on. Okay, okay.\\
214 - This is a textbook example of\\
215 - what I was talking about earlier.\\
216 - When a woman says, "Do you really want to know?"\\
217 - you think you wanna know, but trust me\\
218 - you don't really wanna know.\\
219 - No, I really wanna know.\\
220 - There's someone else.\\
221 - You're right. I did not wanna know.\\
222 - It's someone I was involved with many years ago\\
223 - and he's having a very, very rough time and..\\
224 - ...and he needs me.\\
225 - Oh.\\
226 - Well, that clears it up.\\
227 - Hey, if you like hanging out\\
228 - with guys who are down on their luck\\
229 - why don't you just shack up with my loser friend?\\
230 - Mm-hmm.\\
231 - Um, I'm actually not available.\\
232 - Ugh.\\
233 -     Men       \\
234 -     Men       \\
235 - Wait a minute, there's another guy?\\
236 - Yep.\\
237 - Better than Walden?\\
238 - Apparently.\\
239 - I'm sorry\\
240 - unless this new guy can fly around the room\\
241 - and shoot fire out his ass..\\
242 - ...that bitch is crazy.\\
243 - - Hey. - Well, hey.\\
244 - Look who's finally up.\\
245 - How you feeling, buddy?\\
246 - A little hung-over.\\
247 - Berta, you got any pot brownies?\\
248 - Until they cure glaucoma.\\
249 - Thanks.\\
250 - You want a glass of milk\\
251 - or something to wash that down with?\\
252 - No, I'm good. Thanks.\\
253 - Um, instead of getting loaded, maybe you wanna talk about it?\\
254 - What is there to talk about, Alan?\\
255 - She's with another guy!\\
256 - I changed my mind about the milk.\\
257 - I mean, how can another guy give her anything\\
258 - that I can't give her?\\
259 - Maybe he doesn't talk with his mouth full.\\
260 - You know what?\\
261 - I don't think the other guy\\
262 - can give her anything I can't.\\
263 - Well, you're probably right.\\
264 - Probably?\\
265 - Definitely!\\
266 - You know what? Let's just make a list.\\
267 - Okay, here we go. Look at this.\\
268 - Walden...and the other guy.\\
269 - Let's just call him Dick.\\
270 - Okay.\\
271 - Ability to provide.\\
272 - Walden, billionaire.\\
273 - Dick? Less.\\
274 - That's one point for me.\\
275 - Okay, looks.\\
276 - You win.\\
277 - Thank you, Berta.\\
278 - I didn't wanna say so myself.\\
279 - Oh! There! Humility.\\
280 - That's two more checks for me.\\
281 - Okay, what else? Oh, just an all around great guy.\\
282 - Everybody likes me.\\
283 - Who likes Dick?\\
284 - - Um-- - Berta, please.\\
285 - Oh, God.\\
286 - Zoey likes Dick.\\
287 - Who am I kidding?\\
288 - Zoey loves Dick!\\
289 - Oh, hey, hey.\\
290 - Take it easy.\\
291 - I miss her, Alan.\\
292 - I miss the way she looks at me.\\
293 - Her smile.\\
294 - Sure, sure.\\
295 - Her hair.\\
296 - - Her cute little butt. - Hello, sailor.\\
297 - Just the way our bodies just fit perfectly together.\\
298 - Damn, I should've hugged him.\\
299 -     Men       \\
300 - Trust me, buddy, a stranger in your bed\\
301 - is not gonna chase away the memory of Zoey.\\
302 - What do you suggest I do?\\
303 - Well, what usually helps me is a bottle of supermarket vodka\\
304 - and masturbating using my tears as lubricant.\\
305 - So I'm just supposed to accept being alone forever?\\
306 - Hey, you will never be alone\\
307 - because I will never leave you.\\
308 - - Thanks. - Can't get rid of me.\\
309 - I'm like a dry cough.\\
310 - Yeah, you might be onto something.\\
311 - And maybe I should just give up women.\\
312 - We should go gay!\\
313 - [chuckles] Good one.\\
314 - But, no, I'm serious.\\
315 - Really?\\
316 - Okay, okay, if we're gonna do it, we got to do it right.\\
317 - We'll, uh, we'll get married in New Hampshire\\
318 - uh, register at Pottery Barn\\
319 - adopt a Chinese baby.\\
320 - Ooh, we can wear scarves at our wedding!\\
321 - You would look great in a scarf.\\
322 - It hides the turkey neck.\\
323 - We live together, we like each other.\\
324 - - We're halfway there. - Sure, sure.\\
325 - Mailman already thinks we're gay.\\
326 - Yeah, he does.\\
327 - At-at night, we could sit out on the deck\\
328 - and grill up a couple steaks.\\
329 - [snorts] Steaks? Who are we kidding? Seared ahi.\\
330 - - Oh, better. - Maybe some couscous?\\
331 - - Oh, I love couscous! - Yeah!\\
332 - Yeah, and then, after dinner\\
333 - we could go inside and watch the game.\\
334 - Or if the game's a blowout\\
335 - we switch to "Project Runway."\\
336 - Yeah!\\
337 - Yeah, what do you think?\\
338 - Mr. and Mr. Walden Schmidt.\\
339 - So, I would take your name? Why wouldn't we take my name?\\
340 - 'Cause I'm the breadwinner.\\
341 - So you think making a home isn't work?\\
342 - I am sorry.\\
343 - We'll hyphenate.\\
344 - - Schmidt-Harper. - Harper-Schmidt.\\
345 - Fine.\\
346 - I'll order the towels.\\
347 - So, listen, um...would we be, uh, having sex like guys do?\\
348 - Oh, I would. You'd be having sex more like a woman does.\\
349 - Hmm.\\
350 - Problem?\\
351 - No, I'm open to it. No pun intended.\\
352 - But?\\
353 - Look, I'm willing to take one for the team\\
354 - it's just...if this doesn't work out\\
355 - I'd have to know I'm gonna be provided for.\\
356 - What is that supposed to mean?\\
357 - It means I'm not signing a prenup.\\
358 - Excuse me, is this seat taken?\\
359 - No, help yourself.\\
360 - Thanks.\\
361 - Yo, forget what I said about giving up women.\\
362 - No, yeah, I was just goofin'.\\
363 - Hi, I'm Walden.\\
364 - So close.\\
365 -     Men       \\
366 - I told you I had a big backyard.\\
367 - You didn't tell me it was so-o-o...wet.\\
368 - Yeah, I got to get my sprinklers checked.\\
369 - This happens every day.\\
370 - [chuckling]\\
371 - Who-o-oa.\\
372 - Are you okay?\\
373 - Yeah, I think so.\\
374 - No, I don't think so.\\
375 - Um...are you as high as I am?\\
376 - I'm pretty baked.\\
377 - [chuckling]\\
378 - You're also pretty pretty.\\
379 - Aw.\\
380 - Are you ready to get freaky?\\
381 - I am way ahead of you.\\
382 -     Men       \\
383 - You must think I'm awfully easy.\\
384 - No, I think you're wonderfully easy.\\
385 - [chuckling]\\
386 - Uh-oh, here we go again.\\
387 - I didn't expect anything like this to happen\\
388 - when I went to a bar alone\\
389 - in a short skirt and no underwear.\\
390 - Ah, geez.\\
391 - What's the matter?\\
392 - Nothing. I..\\
393 - I'm just coming out of a bad break-up\\
394 - so I'm a little shaky.\\
395 - That's okay.\\
396 - I know how to make you forget her.\\
397 - Uh-oh.\\
398 - Still thinkin' about your girlfriend?\\
399 - No.\\
400 - It's my ex-wife this time.\\
401 - Okay. Let's try again.\\
402 - [moaning]\\
403 - Mommy.\\
404 - "Mommy?"\\
405 - Okay...daddy.\\
406 - [laughing] Can we just hold on for a second?\\
407 - Am I doing something wrong?\\
408 - No, no.\\
409 - I, um..\\
410 - I might just be a little too high.\\
411 - Okay, let's slow it down. I got nowhere to be.\\
412 - Great.\\
413 - [imitating a woman] I could kiss you all night long.\\
414 - [Walden screaming]\\
415 - I could have made him scream like that.\\
416 -     Men       \\
417 -     Men       \\
418 - I'm really sorry.\\
419 - Me too.\\
420 - I don't usually mistake\\
421 - the women I'm sleeping with\\
422 - for adult contemporary pop artists.\\
423 - That's new.\\
424 - I need air.\\
425 - Alright, no pot for a while.\\
426 - [Zoey] 'Oh, well done, you.'\\
427 - It wasn't the pot.\\
428 - Would you please just get out of my head?\\
429 - Yelling's not gonna solve your problems, Walden.\\
430 - Oh, damn it.\\
431 - Women leaving, that's your problem.\\
432 - Not right now, it isn't!\\
433 - It was my fault, really.\\
434 - Oh, great.\\
435 - I was the first to abandon him.\\
436 - Oh, you didn't abandon him, you had a career.\\
437 - Huh, tell him that.\\
438 - Just all of you just leave me alone?\\
439 - Go away, I tell you! Go away!\\
440 - No way I'm signin' a prenup.\\
441 - You know what? Just get out of my head!\\
442 - Just leave me alone!\\
443 -     Men       \\

\subsection {Episode 02: A Big Bag of Dog}
1 -     Men       \\
2 - Good morning.\\
3 - Top of the morning to you, sir.\\
4 - Oh, God. Did you have a stroke?\\
5 - Oh, no, no stroke.\\
6 - I'm bleaching my teeth.\\
7 - What?\\
8 - Hmm. Sorry, I'm bleaching my teeth.\\
9 - Oh.\\
10 - And what are you up to?\\
11 - Nothing just reading the news.\\
12 - Mmm. Me, too. Old-school.\\
13 - Anything interesting over there?\\
14 - Just reading an article about how home teeth-whitening\\
15 - systems might cause mouth cancer.\\
16 - Really?\\
17 - No, of course not.\\
18 - Why are you even bothering with that thing?\\
19 - Walden, I get rejected by women for 100 different reasons.\\
20 - Whiter teeth would make it 99.\\
21 - Zoey? Oh.\\
22 - Hi, Ava.\\
23 - Good morning, Walden.\\
24 - What a great surprise. What are you doing?\\
25 - I wanted to invite you to my birthday party.\\
26 - That is so sweet.\\
27 - Uh, but I don't know if I can.\\
28 - Why not?\\
29 - Oh, boy. Uh, is your mom there?\\
30 - She's taking a shower.\\
31 - Maybe, when she gets out, you could ask her if I can come.\\
32 - Why? It's not her birthday.\\
33 - Oh, this is breaking my heart.\\
34 - Here's the thing, Ava.\\
35 - I'm not your mom's boyfriend anymore.\\
36 - I know that.\\
37 - She's in the shower with Peter.\\
38 - Kids say the darnedest things.\\
39 - Okay, I'll tell you what, Ava. Uh..\\
40 - ..why don't you let me talk to your mom\\
41 - and we'll figure something out.\\
42 - Okay. I love you, Walden.\\
43 - I love you, too.\\
44 - Good-bye.\\
45 - Bye.\\
46 - Damn it.\\
47 - I can't believe she's sleeping with this guy already.\\
48 - Well, we don't know that.\\
49 - All we know is they're in the shower together.\\
50 - You're not helping.\\
51 - Sorry.\\
52 - Hey, I know what will cheer you up.\\
53 - A whiter smile.\\
54 - I've got another bleaching tray. How about it?\\
55 - No.\\
56 - You sure? You know what they say.\\
57 - A million-dollar smile gathers a lot of interest.\\
58 - Who says that?\\
59 - It's the slogan on the box.\\
60 - At least I think it is.\\
61 - My Spanish is a little shaky.\\
62 - - I'll pass. - You sure?\\
63 - Might get your mind off of Zoey.\\
64 - - My mind is not on Zoey. - Okay, fine.\\
65 - You need to stop parking your car in the garage.\\
66 - - Oh, really? How come? - It's leaking oil.\\
67 - Oh, I don't think so.\\
68 - I haven't put oil in it in two years.\\
69 - Well, it's leaking something.\\
70 - Well, why don't I just put down some cardboard?\\
71 - Why don't you just put it on the street?\\
72 - Oh, no, the salty sea air is very corrosive.\\
73 - It'll hurt the blue book value.\\
74 - Alan, you drive a 13-year-old Volvo station wagon\\
75 - with a quarter of a million miles on it.\\
76 - The blue book has more value than your car.\\
77 - - Well, okay, but I-I-- - No buts!\\
78 - You put your car on the street\\
79 - or I'll put your ass on the street.\\
80 - What a colossal douche.\\
81 - - 'What?' - Just moving my car, boss.\\
82 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\
83 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\
84 -     Men men men men manly men    \\
85 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\
86 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\
87 -     Men       \\
88 -     Men       \\
89 - Hey.\\
90 - Hey.\\
91 - I want to apologize for going off on you this morning.\\
92 - No need.\\
93 - - Really? - Water under the bridge.\\
94 - Which, coincidentally, is where I had to park my car.\\
95 - Well, I appreciate that.\\
96 - And, uh, just FYI, pigeons nest under there.\\
97 - My car already looks like it's covered in mashed potatoes.\\
98 - I'll get it washed for you.\\
99 - It'll need detailing.\\
100 - No problem.\\
101 - And oil.\\
102 - Sure.\\
103 - We good?\\
104 - Yeah, I suppose.\\
105 - Now, show me that million-peso smile.\\
106 - Oh, no, I-I, you can't really tell.\\
107 - Ah, come on.\\
108 - Wow!\\
109 - Nice!\\
110 - It's like a movie star's smile.\\
111 - You think? You think?\\
112 - Yeah, they look like little Chiclets.\\
113 - Oh, thank you. Thank you.\\
114 - Hey, I'm really sorry about the whole car thing.\\
115 - This breakup's got me a little crazy.\\
116 - Oh, I understand.\\
117 - When my wife left me, I had a lot of anger.\\
118 - Of course, I internalized it, which led to a lot of hair\\
119 - in the sink and blood in the toilet.\\
120 - So, you know what it's like to love someone so much\\
121 - that your heart feels like it's going to explode\\
122 - from your chest with pure happiness.\\
123 - Oh, God, no, I was just pissed off about losing the house.\\
124 - My point is that-that everybody has problems\\
125 - but what's important is how you deal with them.\\
126 - Here, let me get that for you.\\
127 - See, the key is, you got to tap it in the right spot.\\
128 - It's not, oh.\\
129 - - It's okay. I-I got it. - No, no, I got it.\\
130 - What the hell?\\
131 - Son of a bitch!\\
132 - It's fine. Don't worry about it.\\
133 - No, it's not. I want ketchup, and I can't have it.\\
134 - Calm down. It's just a condiment.\\
135 - Choose me, damn it! Choose me!\\
136 - Okay, we're-we're not talking about ketchup anymore, are we?\\
137 - What else would we be talking about?\\
138 - Okay, Uh..\\
139 - Here, let me help you clean that up.\\
140 - Oh, no, no.\\
141 - - Don't worry about it. - You know what? Here.\\
142 - Give me your shirt and pants and I'll throw them in the washer.\\
143 - Oh, that's not necessary, actually.\\
144 - Give me your shirt and pants!\\
145 - Oh, uh, don't wash the shirt with the pants\\
146 - 'cause it's off brand and the colors tend to run.\\
147 - Oh, and, uh and wash the pants in cold water.\\
148 - They shrink in warm water.\\
149 - Of course, that's funny because, uh, I shrink in cold water.\\
150 - Just give me your stupid clothes!\\
151 - Here.\\
152 - I am so back in the garage.\\
153 - [doorbell ringing]\\
154 - Oh..\\
155 - Perfect.\\
156 - Coming!\\
157 - With any luck, it'll be a door-to-door ketchup salesman.\\
158 - Oh, Robin.\\
159 - Hello, Alan.\\
160 - Sorry. Uh, come on in.\\
161 - - Walden, your mom's here! - 'Be right there!'\\
162 - So, nice to see you.\\
163 - Well, it's nice to see so much of you.\\
164 - Your son insisted I take off my clothes after he soiled them.\\
165 - That sounded weird, didn't it?\\
166 - So, uh so, what brings you by?\\
167 - - Walden's taking me to lunch. - Oh, lovely.\\
168 - I enjoy the occasional lunch with my mom.\\
169 - Really?\\
170 - As one enjoys the occasional colonoscopy.\\
171 - Walden!\\
172 - Sorry.\\
173 - Let's go.\\
174 - - I'll drive. - Okay.\\
175 - Oh, bon appetit.\\
176 - - Bye. - Bye.\\
177 - Everything about that man is disturbing.\\
178 - Nice to see you again.\\
179 - Oh, look. New yellow pages.\\
180 - [door shutting]\\
181 - Oh, man.\\
182 - Oh, boy.\\
183 - - Uh, Berta! - Yeah?\\
184 - 'I'm locked out.'\\
185 - Hang on.\\
186 - 'Hurry up, I don't have any clothes on.'\\
187 - Hello?\\
188 - 'Berta?'\\
189 - 'Oh, come on!'\\
190 -     Men       \\
191 - This is nice.\\
192 - You and I haven't gone out for a bite to eat in a long time.\\
193 - Yeah.\\
194 - It's a shame, Zoey couldn't join us.\\
195 - Mm-hmm.\\
196 - How's she doing?\\
197 - - Fine. - Good. I'm glad.\\
198 - She's a great gal.\\
199 - You don't want to let that one get away.\\
200 - Right.\\
201 - How old is her daughter? Eight?\\
202 - She's almost nine.\\
203 - - When's her birthday? - Few days.\\
204 - Oh, fun. Is there going to be a party?\\
205 - Yeah.\\
206 - You know, for one of your birthdays\\
207 - I got you a bouncy castle. Do you remember?\\
208 - I do.\\
209 - You should get one of those for Zoey's daughter.\\
210 - - That's a good idea. - Oh.\\
211 - And take lots of pictures.\\
212 - Those are the moments you remember forever.\\
213 - Wha-what's happening?\\
214 - We're out of gas.\\
215 - We just passed a station.\\
216 - I'll be right back.\\
217 - This is an electric car.\\
218 -     Men       \\
219 - - Hey. - Hey.\\
220 - Hey, wait, aren't you having lunch with your mom?\\
221 - I was, but then she insisted on taking an interest in my life.\\
222 - That bitch.\\
223 - What are you working on?\\
224 - Oh, the, uh the NASDAQ presentation.\\
225 - I could use a hand.\\
226 - Sure. Send it over.\\
227 - Okay, here. Here it comes.\\
228 - Oh, how'd the marriage proposal go?\\
229 - Went fine.\\
230 - How big of a rock did you give her?\\
231 - Pretty big.\\
232 - She go under the table to thank you?\\
233 - No, but you can.\\
234 - Wow, Walden!\\
235 - 'Dude.'\\
236 - - When's the big day? - Don't know.\\
237 - What do you mean, you don't know?\\
238 - I mean we haven't set a date yet!\\
239 - Whoa. Don't bite my head off, man, okay?\\
240 - Just wow.\\
241 - - Oh, my God. - What?\\
242 - She shot you down, didn't she?\\
243 - Can we just focus on the presentation?\\
244 - No, we can't! Listen.\\
245 - Look, did she give you a reason?\\
246 - - Billy, seriously, let it go. - Was it, was it..\\
247 - Was it, was it, that you were, you were too pretty or too rich?\\
248 - Walden, Walden, this proves that God exists\\
249 - and he's a short fat guy that didn't get laid in high school.\\
250 - - Stop, please. - No, listen, listen, okay.\\
251 - First Bridget divorces you, and starts dating me.\\
252 - And I mean, like, right?\\
253 - Then, then you get dumped by Mary Poppins.\\
254 - I mean, Walden, you've gotta wonder\\
255 - what is it about you that drives women away?\\
256 - Billy, this is your last chance, dude.\\
257 - Okay, I'm changing the subject.\\
258 - 'Changing the subject, okay?'\\
259 - I banged your ex-wife in the shower this morning.\\
260 - [screaming]\\
261 -     Men       \\
262 -     Men       \\
263 - [knock on door]\\
264 - Go away!\\
265 - Did you say come in?\\
266 - What do you want, Alan?\\
267 - Oh, I'm just checking in.\\
268 - You know, you've been hiding out up here for\\
269 - quite a few days now.\\
270 - Yeah, I'm busy.\\
271 - I can.. I can see that.\\
272 - So, what do you got here?\\
273 - Is this Versailles or an Indian casino?\\
274 - No, it's a dream house.\\
275 - I'm gonna send it to Zoey, so she could see\\
276 - where we could have lived if we would have gotten married.\\
277 - Sure, that's not weird.\\
278 - Um, oh, oh, uh, you been smoking some pot?\\
279 - - No. - Oh, what a shame.\\
280 - Would've explained a lot. Um..\\
281 - ...listen, buddy, maybe it's time to take a break.\\
282 - No, I gotta finish the roof before the rainy season.\\
283 - Oh, there's weather in LEGOLAND? Um..\\
284 - Oh, by the way, I-I brought you your own tooth-whitening kit.\\
285 - You know, in case you ever feel like smiling again.\\
286 - Uh, "As seen on Telemundo".\\
287 - - Put it in the Zoey room. - What?\\
288 - The Zoey room.\\
289 - Oh. Alrighty..\\
290 - Oh, boy.\\
291 - You can almost see the yellow police tape.\\
292 - On the plus side, my teeth look fantastic.\\
293 -     Men       \\
294 - Thank you all for coming.\\
295 - I know you're all as concerned about Walden as I am.\\
296 - You know what I'm concerned about?\\
297 - I'm concerned with the tooth he knocked out of my head.\\
298 - I smoked crack for three and a half years\\
299 - I didn't lose tooth one.\\
300 - Then golden boy gets dumped, I look like\\
301 - an extra on Hillbilly Handfishin', huh?\\
302 - I'd just like to point out, that Walden is not the first rich\\
303 - and handsome guy to snap his bean up in that room.\\
304 - Thank you, Berta.\\
305 - I'm just saying, maybe the house is haunted.\\
306 - Maybe it's plagued by a negative entity who just won't leave.\\
307 - Hey, you're not gonna hang this on me.\\
308 - It's my hope that if we share our concerns with Walden\\
309 - with a unified voice, we might be able to get through to him.\\
310 - Like an intervention?\\
311 - Oh, those suck.\\
312 - They're like, they're like judgmental surprise parties.\\
313 - They're like, "Surprise, you're a loser."\\
314 - I don't need an intervention.\\
315 - I'm fine.\\
316 - Sweetie, we're worried about you.\\
317 - You don't have to worry anymore.\\
318 - I'm done with Zoey.\\
319 - Please tell me that's not her in the bag.\\
320 - No, it's the Legos and the pictures.\\
321 - Oh, good.\\
322 - This breakup hit me a lot harder than I thought.\\
323 - [dog barking]\\
324 - Well, anyway, I-I want to apologize\\
325 - for the way that I've been acting.\\
326 - Um, I think I went a little off the rails.\\
327 - A little? I had perfect teeth.\\
328 - Oh, I just whitened mine.\\
329 - Yeah, now you're good-looking.\\
330 - Anyway, I appreciate you all being worried about me.\\
331 - [dog barking]\\
332 - But I-I really think I've turned the corner.\\
333 - God, what is with that dog?\\
334 - Honey, don't worry about the dog.\\
335 - You were saying?\\
336 - I said, I yes, I was saying that uh, lately I've been really sad\\
337 - and I didn't know how to deal with it, so I got angry.\\
338 - But I think now I know how to process\\
339 - those feelings, so I..\\
340 - Damn it!\\
341 - Walden!\\
342 - Oh, God, what has he done?\\
343 - Sounds like he killed a dog?\\
344 -     Men       \\
345 - Okay, problem solved.\\
346 - You stole a dog?\\
347 - No, I bought him.\\
348 - He's real smart. Watch this.\\
349 - Sit.\\
350 - Sit.\\
351 - 'Sit.'\\
352 - Okay, stand up.\\
353 - What a good dog.\\
354 -     Men       \\
355 - Hey.\\
356 - Whoa, that is a big bag of dog food.\\
357 - He's a big bag of dog.\\
358 - You sure taking on a pet is a good idea?\\
359 - Yeah, I think it'll help me a lot, you know?\\
360 - Just unconditional love from an animal that'll never leave me.\\
361 - I thought that's what I was for, but okay.\\
362 - Check it out, I got him a chew toy\\
363 - with big, white teeth just like yours.\\
364 - Grr!\\
365 - Yeah, that is cute. Um, come here.\\
366 - Let me show you something else that's cute.\\
367 - I might want to get a trainer.\\
368 - Way ahead of you.\\
369 - I got a number for you to call.\\
370 - What did I do with my phone?\\
371 - Oh, here. Why don't I call you so you can find it?\\
372 - You're number one on my speed dial, by the way.\\
373 - [cell phone ringing]\\
374 - Wonder how many bars he gets in there.\\
375 -     Men       \\
376 - Ooh, Walden, you came to my party!\\
377 - I did. And I brought you a present.\\
378 - [whistling]\\
379 - Oh, boy! Is he mine?\\
380 - He sure is.\\
381 - Oh, thank you. What's his name?\\
382 - He doesn't have one. It's up to you.\\
383 - You can name him whatever you want.\\
384 - I'm gonna call him Walden.\\
385 - It's perfect.\\
386 - What's going on? Walden!\\
387 - Look, Mummy! Walden got me a dog for my birthday!\\
388 - What?\\
389 - I love you, Walden!\\
390 - You're gonna be hearing that a lot.\\
391 - Happy birthday, Ava.\\
392 - Wait, wait, Walden, come back here!\\
393 - I can't. I wasn't invited.\\
394 - Uh-oh. Walden took a big poop.\\
395 -     Men       \\
396 -     Men       \\
397 - Oh, hey. How you doing?\\
398 - I've never felt better in my whole life.\\

402 - I do.\\
403 - Atta boy.\\
404 - Hey, where's Dog-zilla?\\

6 - our relationship has become a little bit predict..\\
7 - Predictable? Yes.\\
8 - Why do you ask?\\
9 - Well, I was thinking that maybe we could..\\
10 - ...spice things up a little.\\
11 - What'd you have in mind?\\
12 - Well, um..\\
13 - ...I have been reading "Fifty Shades Of Grey."\\
14 - Oh.\\

20 - Forget the book.\\
21 - What about you?\\
22 - Do you have any fantasies?\\
23 - Oh, of course I do.\\
24 - If I lived only my regular life\\
25 - I'd eat a rifle.\\
26 - Tell me one.\\
27 - Well, I..\\
28 - ...guess I...always wanted to..\\
29 - ...take some naughty pictures of you.\\
30 - We could do that.\\
31 - - Really? - Yeah, why not?\\
32 - There's already a lot available online.\\
33 - What else?\\
34 - Oh, well, I-I-I guess\\
35 - it's a-a cliche for a guy but, um..\\
36 - I've...always wanted to have a-a threesome.\\
37 - Okay.\\
38 - And I know it's silly. I know--\\
39 - No, I mean, okay, we can do it.\\
40 - If you are messing with me there is no way\\
41 - I will everforgive you!\\
42 - I'm not messing with you.\\
43 - Seriously, we can have a threesome?\\
44 - Come on, you'd do the same for me.\\
45 - - Of course, I would. - Good.\\
46 - 'Cause I have a fantasy of my own.\\
47 - Oh, hmm, lay it on me, baby.\\
48 - I want to have a threesome also.\\
49 - See? See?\\
50 - This is why communication\\
51 - isso important in a relationship.\\

53 - I didn't care if you lived or died.\\
54 - Now, I love you more than any man has ever loved a woman.\\
55 - You complete me but add another chick and I'll complete myself.\\
56 - - Great! - So, what's your pleasure?\\

66 - you know, that-that way.\\
67 - [giggles]\\
68 - Four balls, two bats and one mitt.\\

82 - So, you want to have a threesome with me and Walden?\\
83 - You have your fantasy, I have mine.\\
84 - Yeah, but mine's a traditional\\
85 - wholesome three-way.\\
86 - You, me and an anonymous drunken slut.\\
87 - The way God intended.\\
88 - Walden is a friend. Plus, we see him all the time.\\
89 - - So? - So it'll be awkward.\\
90 - Not for me.\\
91 - I-I just don't think it's a good time.\\
92 - I mean, he just broke up with Zoey\\
93 - and he's feeling very vulnerable right now.\\
94 - I think this would help.\\
95 - You know, he needs to get back on the horse\\
96 - and in this case, ne-e-eigh!\\
97 - Do we have a deal?\\
98 - Alright, after we have mine, we will approach Walden--\\
99 - - No, no, no, no. I go first. - Why?\\
100 - Speaking from experience\\
101 - once you get yours, I'll never get mine.\\
102 - I am offended..\\
103 - ...that you would insinuate\\
104 - that I would break a sacred trust.\\
105 - I love you, Lyndsey, and if you can't believe in me\\
106 - then, then we have bigger problems\\
107 - in our relationship than whose dirty, nasty\\
108 - hump-fest we have first.\\
109 - Take it or leave it.\\
110 - [sighs]\\
111 - Take it.\\
112 - Oh, I plan to.\\
113 -     Men       \\
114 - Gorgeous day, isn't it?\\
115 - Wonder what the poor people are doing.\\
116 - One of them is asking me what the poor people are doing.\\
117 - [laughs]\\
118 - Rich, good-looking and funny.\\
119 - God certainly gave with three hands.\\
120 - Hey, speaking of three hands, um..\\
121 - ...there's something I-I need to ask you.\\
122 - - Sure. - Oh, boy, where do I start?\\
123 - Uh, um, okay, here's the deal.\\
124 - Um, things with Lyndsey and me\\
125 - have gotten a little stale, uh, sexually speaking.\\
126 - Everything is by the numbers.\\
127 - I get it. You're skipping right from 68 to 70.\\
128 - Exactly, exactly.\\
129 - Um, anyhoo..\\
130 - ...uh...we've come up with a solution.\\
131 - What's that?\\
132 - We're going to have a, uh, a threesome.\\
133 - [chuckles]\\
134 - Really? What? She agreed to that?\\
135 - Yup.\\
136 - Dude, way to go.\\
137 - Yeah, yeah, it's great.\\
138 - Um, the thing is..\\
139 - ...um, Lyndsey wants to have a sausage fest\\
140 - before the clambake.\\
141 - [both laughing]\\
142 - - That's clever. - Yeah.\\
143 - Yeah, and she-she has this crazy idea\\
144 - that before I have mythreesome\\
145 - she wants to have one of her own.\\
146 - Whoa, what, hold on.\\
147 - She wants to have a threesome without you?\\
148 - Oh, no, no, I'm gonna be there, uh, uh, but with..\\
149 - ...another guy.\\
150 - - Huh. - Yeah.\\
151 - And the, the really crazy part is..\\
152 - [laughing]\\
153 - ...um, uh..\\
154 - ...that she wants the other guy\\
155 - uh, to be, um, you.\\
156 - Okay.\\
157 - Yeah, now, I-I-I told her\\
158 - that there was no way--\\
159 - Oh, no, no, no. I'm in.\\
160 - Wh-what? What? You're in?\\
161 - Yeah, sure. It sounds like fun.\\
162 - You know, now that Zoey and I aren't together\\
163 - I don't see any reason why I shouldn't be\\
164 - doing my own thing.\\
165 - And Lyndsey's own thing.\\
166 - Probably not your own thing.\\
167 - - Well, ar-ar-are you sure? - Yeah. Why not?\\
168 - Time to shake things up, get out of my comfort zone, you know?\\
169 - Maybe slip into your comfort zone.\\
170 - Get it?\\
171 - I got it.\\
172 - Well, I guess, I guess, I should let Lyndsey know.\\
173 - [laughs]\\
174 - Um, she'll be thrilled.\\
175 - As am I.\\
176 - Yay.\\
177 - Hey, do you..\\
178 - You wanna do this, right?\\
179 - Oh, oh, absolutely, uh, you know\\
180 - I'm-I'm very open-minded\\
181 - uh, about sexual matters.\\
182 - After all, I-I did grow up\\
183 - during the sexual revolution.\\
184 - Well, technically, a few years after\\
185 - but there were still condoms and diaphragms\\
186 - layin' all over the place.\\
187 - Oh, and, uh, just a heads-up..\\
188 - ...um...exit only.\\
189 - Nope, not even a thumb.\\
190 -     Men       \\
191 - I am so happy you said yes.\\
192 - I am honored you asked.\\
193 - Aren't you adorable?\\
194 - Not as adorable as you.\\
195 - Oh..\\
196 - Yeah, yeah, we're all adorable.\\
197 - Um..\\
198 - ...w-w-we need to establish some ground rules.\\
199 - Hmm, sure, like what?\\
200 - Uh, well, uh, for instance\\
201 - uh, there are a few things\\
202 - that I happen to know Lyndsey\\
203 - is not exactly fond of doing.\\
204 - No, I'm good.\\
205 - R-really?\\
206 - You're good?\\
207 - With everything?\\
208 - Even the Philadelphia Dump Truck?\\
209 - Back it up.\\
210 - Beep, beep, beep, beep.\\
211 - Anything else?\\
212 - Uh, well, I guess this goes without saying\\
213 - but, uh, you know\\
214 - we're not making Band-Aids here\\
215 - so Johnson should never meet Johnson, so..\\
216 - Well, that's true.\\
217 - Two dongs don't make a right.\\
218 - [laughing]\\
219 - Oh, oh, and speaking of..\\
220 - Um, if you have any desire\\
221 - to stick your tongue in my mouth\\
222 - just stick your tongue in her mouth\\
223 - and then she'll stick her tongue\\
224 - in my mouth and we'll consider\\
225 - the circle complete.\\
226 - Fine.\\
227 - It's your loss.\\
228 - Iwould like to propose a toast.\\
229 - Oh!\\
230 - Friends may come and friends may go\\
231 - friends may peter out, you know.\\
232 - But here's to us\\
233 - through thick and thin\\
234 - peter out and peter in.\\
235 - Hear, hear.\\
236 - Cheers.\\
237 - So, what do you say?\\
238 - Let's get these balls rollin'.\\
239 -     Men       \\
240 - This is okay, what we're doing, right?\\
241 - I mean, we're all consenting adults.\\
242 - Oh. Oh, yeah, sure.\\
243 - Sure.\\
244 - I mean, you know, if one of us was\\
245 - mentally impaired\\
246 - then the-the consent might be suspect.\\
247 - True, I mean, i-if you were\\
248 - required to wear a helmet or..\\
249 - ...have a service dog..\\
250 - ...that might be construed\\
251 - as takingadvantage.\\
252 - Yeah, yeah, but everybody here\\
253 - knows what they're getting into, so..\\
254 - Yeah, nobodies taking their\\
255 - pants off for a candy bar.\\
256 - Or...absolution.\\
257 - Um, so, listen..\\
258 - ...uh..\\
259 - ...don't feel obligated\\
260 - to bring your A game today, okay?\\
261 - My A game?\\
262 - Yeah, I mean, what I'm saying is..\\
263 - ...you're younger than I am\\
264 - you're prettier than I am\\
265 - there's...more..\\
266 - of you than there is of me.\\
267 - What do you want me to do?\\
268 - Well, I'm just saying we're playing on a public course here\\
269 - spot me a couple of strokes.\\
270 - You just be the maypole\\
271 - and let her run around with the ribbons.\\
272 - No, no, that is not my style.\\
273 - I'm very aggressive. I'm in it to win it.\\
274 - What do you think, boys?\\
275 - I am definitely gonna win it.\\
276 - Oh, yeah, well, we'll see about that.\\
277 - Uh, you do look beautiful, darling.\\
278 - Yeah, thanks.\\
279 - Ooh!\\
280 - This is probably bad to say but..\\
281 - ...Zoey had an outfit like that\\
282 - she used to wear all the time.\\
283 - Well, not all the time.\\
284 - Just when we were having sex.\\
285 - Which was pretty much all the time.\\
286 - I'm sorry, sweetie.\\
287 - Oh, I guess we're starting.\\
288 - Okay, uh, um..\\
289 - You know, I-I, um..\\
290 - ...I not only loved Zoey.\\
291 - I also loved her daughter.\\
292 - That is beautiful.\\
293 - I kinda thought we were gonna be family.\\
294 - We're your family now.\\
295 - I'm starting to feel a little like\\
296 - a very distant cousin.\\
297 - [sobbing] I miss her so much.\\
298 - [Lyndsey sighs]\\
299 - I'd have given odds that I'd be the one crying.\\
300 -     Men       \\
301 -     Men       \\
302 - Walden, you doing okay in there?\\
303 - [Walden] 'I'm okay.'\\
304 - 'I just need a minute.'\\
305 - Maybe this just isn't meant to be.\\
306 - Why not?\\
307 - The man is clearly upset.\\
308 - Oh, boo-hoo.\\
309 - [door opens]\\
310 - I'm really sorry.\\
311 - Hey, no need to apologize.\\
312 - In fact, if it would help\\
313 - you can close your eyes and pretend I'm Zoey.\\
314 - - Really? - Of course.\\
315 - Um, should I pretend you're somebody else?\\
316 - Do whatever you want.\\
317 - That's a good idea. Let's-let's try that.\\
318 - - Attaboy. - Okay.\\
319 - Oh, Zoey!\\
320 - [imitating Zoey] Oh, Walden.\\
321 - Give us a good shagging, won't you?\\
322 - I can't.\\
323 - 'I can't do this!'\\
324 - "Give us a good shagging, won't you?"\\
325 - - What? That's a thing. - It doesn't matter.\\
326 - Let's just make sure we don't\\
327 - get a crybaby for my threesome.\\
328 - Your threesome?\\
329 - We haven't even had mine yet.\\
330 - Uh, I beg to differ.\\
331 - I held up my part of the bargain.\\
332 - If I serve pie and nobody's hungry\\
333 - it still counts as dessert.\\
334 - I suppose.\\
335 - Now what?\\
336 - Well, not that you care\\
337 - but I did take a lethal dose\\
338 - of boner pills before we started.\\
339 - Is that so?\\
340 - I'm either going to have sex or a stroke.\\
341 - Your call.\\
342 - Come on. Let's go to your bedroom.\\
343 - Really?\\
344 - I'd rather take care of you\\
345 - for the next 20 minutes\\
346 - than the next 20 years.\\
347 - That's the spirit.\\
348 -     Men       \\
349 - It's a beautiful day.\\
350 - Why don't you go down to the beach\\
351 - and find some kids to play with?\\
352 - I don't wanna.\\
353 - Okay, why don't you\\
354 - go ride your bike?\\
355 - I don't feel like it.\\
356 - Well, you can't sit in the house all day\\
357 - staring at that computer.\\
358 - I made a billion dollars doing this.\\
359 - Carry on.\\
360 - [Skype caller tone]\\
361 - - Hi. - Hi.\\
362 - Great to see you.\\
363 - What's up?\\

368 - The-the one with the drinking problem?\\
369 - The very same.\\
370 - What she ha..\\

372 - Well, she wanted to tell me\\
373 - in no particular order\\
374 - that you're a great guy..\\
375 - ...that you're still very much in love with me\\
376 - and that I'm a complete idiot\\
377 - for breaking up with you.\\
378 - I am. I am. You are.\\
379 - You didn't put her up to that call, did you?\\
380 - No, not at all.\\
381 - 'I do miss you.'\\
382 - It's been veryhardfor me too.\\
383 - I was kinda hoping that you'd say that.\\
384 - So, do you think that--\\
385 - You, sir, can make out\\
386 - with my girlfriend any time you want.\\
387 - [Alan] You got her so worked up\\
388 - she humped my brains out.\\
389 - So, where were we?\\
390 - I miss you, you miss me, ah..\\
391 - [thud] 'Ow! What did I do?'\\
392 - [thud] 'Ow!'\\
393 -     Men       \\
394 - Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.\\
395 - Oh, boy. Oh, boy.\\
396 - This is just like Christmas morning.\\
397 - But instead of celebrating the birth of our Lord\\
398 - little Alan's gonna get some strange.\\
399 - I know you're excited\\
400 - but the first step is\\
401 - selecting the right girl.\\
402 - Mm.\\
403 - Hey, what about that\\
404 - blonde over there?\\
405 - Eh, I guess.\\
406 - What's wrong with her?\\
407 - Well, her outfit's a little matchy-matchy, isn't it?\\
408 - The outfit's going to be on the floor of the bedroom.\\
409 - Well, still, it says something\\
410 - about her lack of imagination.\\
411 - Fine.\\
412 - Hey, how about the redhead?\\
413 - Ooh, redheads.\\
414 - They do dirty things.\\
415 - - So, should we approach her? - No, no, hang on. Hang on.\\
416 - - She's got a tramp stamp. - So?\\
417 - It's a little skanky, isn't it?\\
418 - We're trying to invite her to a threesome.\\
419 - Skanky is good.\\
420 - You're right. You're right.\\
421 - Oh, although, she does have cankles.\\
422 - Skanky cankles.\\
423 - Isn't that what they call Santa Claus in Norway?\\
424 - Are you done?\\
425 - Sorry, just a little case of\\
426 - the pre-menagejitters.\\
427 - You do realize if I wasn't here\\
428 - you couldn't get any of these women?\\
429 - I'm not so sure about that.\\
430 - I still have a few moves up my sleeve.\\
431 - - Really? - Mm-hmm.\\
432 - Be my guest.\\
433 - Fine. Okay, watch this.\\
434 - - Hello. - No.\\
435 - I'm good with whoever you pick.\\
436 -     Men       \\
437 - [Alan] 'I-I'm confused.'\\

440 - Ex-husband.\\
441 - [Alan and Lyndsey] Ah.\\
442 - Wow. What a view.\\
443 - The view from here is pretty good, too.\\

5 - Yeah.\\
6 - I just can't remember what I came down here for.\\
7 - Oh. That happens to me all the time.\\
8 - I-I can't remember a specific example, but yeah.\\
9 - Yeah, that's annoying. Uh, maybe you were hungry.\\
10 - Did you come down to get something to eat?\\
11 - No, I just ate.\\
12 - Were you going to watch TV?\\
13 - No. I have a TV in my room.\\
14 - This is very disconcerting.\\
15 - Don't panic. I mean, we'll figure this out.\\
16 - Did you come down to give me the money you owe me?\\
17 - Ah.\\
18 - It's worth a shot.\\
19 - No. I was upstairs, and I thought to myself\\
20 - "I need to come downstairs and.."\\
21 - [grunting]\\
22 - You know what might help? A little less..\\
23 - - "Whoa, dude, where's my car?" - No, it's not the pot.\\
24 - I've been smoking pot since..\\
25 - It's-it's not the pot.\\

37 - Thank you so much for sending that car for me.\\
38 - I mean, I felt like a big ol' movie star at the airport.\\
39 - The driver held up a sign with my name on it\\
40 - carried my bags, and even gave me a bottle of water from Fiji.\\
41 - - It probably wasn't from Fiji-- - Would you look at this house?\\
42 - I mean, right here on the ocean.\\
43 - This is like something you would see in a magazine\\
44 - except there would be famous people\\
45 - standing here instead of us.\\
46 - It is so nice to see you.\\
47 - Well, it is nice to see you, too. Let me..\\
48 - Uh, Missi, let me introduce you to my friend--\\
49 - Hi, I'm Missi.\\
50 - Everyone thinks it's short for Melissa,\\
51 - but it's actually short for Mississippi.\\
52 - The river not the state.\\
53 - 'Cause according to my parents\\
54 - I was conceived on the deck of a gambling boat\\
55 - when my daddy won a $5,000 jackpot on the Caribbean poker.\\
56 - Wow, that's a--\\
57 - Had you ever been to the Caribbean?\\
58 - I went there three years ago for Spring break\\
59 - and got stung by a jellyfish.\\
60 - My friend had to pee on my leg.\\
61 - Alan.\\
62 - - Uh, it's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you, too.\\
63 - Um, could you direct me to the little girl's room?\\
64 - I mean, unless one of y'all\\
65 - have recently been stung by a jellyfish.\\
66 - - Oh, it's right here. - Thank you.\\
67 - Wow.\\
68 - She's a pistol.\\
69 - More like an AK-47.\\
70 - So, uh, what's, uh.. what's the story here?\\
71 - Uh, you and her..?\\
72 - No. She's my old friend Jerry's daughter..\\
73 - ...and she's thinking about moving here, so I told him\\
74 - she could stay here for a couple days, and I'd show her around.\\
75 - Mm. She's very pretty.\\
76 - Yeah?\\
77 - How old do you think she is?\\
78 - - Like, 18 or 19. - Oh, perfect.\\
79 - You might lose a friend but you won't go to jail.\\
80 - Ow! Hey! Hey, hey, don't hit me 'cause you can't hit that.\\
81 - Ow!\\
82 -     Men       \\
83 - Oh, my God, the weather here is amazing.\\
84 - You know, I could just lay out in the sun\\
85 - all day just like a big ol' lizard.\\
86 - Back home, I have to get a spray tan\\
87 - and sometimes it comes out a little orange\\
88 - which is totally fine during Halloween\\
89 - 'cause I can always say that I'm going as a pumpkin.\\
90 - - Oh, that's interesting. - I love Halloween.\\
91 - Last year, I went to this party as a slutty nurse\\
92 - and then, the year before that I was a slutty cat\\
93 - and the year before that, I was a ladybug.\\
94 - A slutty ladybug?\\
95 - What? No! Why would I be a slutty ladybug?\\
96 - Oh, I just..\\
97 - - So.. - Thought since you were..\\
98 - - What's the deal with Alan? - Oh, we..\\
99 - Y'all, like, gay for each other or something?\\
100 - I mean, it's totally fine if you are.\\
101 - I have a gay friend. His name is Russell.\\
102 - I got him to make out with me one time, but it didn't take.\\
103 - No. We...we are not gay.\\
104 - We are definitely not gay.\\
105 - Uh-uh..\\
106 - So, your dad tells me that you're, um..\\
107 - ...you're thinking about relocating.\\
108 - Well, to be honest with you,\\
109 - I'm not really sure what I want to do.\\
110 - You know, I can always keep working as a dental assistant.\\
111 - You know, that person that sucks the spit out of your mouth\\
112 - with that little Wet-Vac\\
113 - and then gives you the free toothbrush and the lollipop.\\
114 - You do know what the lollipop's for, right?\\
115 - - Well, I'm assuming.. - Repeat business.\\
116 - You know, if it were up to me, I'd just give them caramel apple\\
117 - or a little taffy or something.\\
118 - Pull their teeth right out of their little heads.\\
119 - Now, that's how you make money off children.\\
120 - Well, that and baby beauty pageants.\\
121 - Right.\\
122 - - So, uh... - Do you have a girlfriend?\\
123 - Uh...no, I do not.\\
124 - I just went through a breakup.\\
125 - Oh, you poor baby.\\
126 - I am so sorry.\\
127 - Could you put some suntan lotion on my back?\\
128 - Uh, sure.\\
129 - Thanks.\\
130 - Well, don't forget to rubba-dub-dub.\\
131 - - Rubba-dub-dub? - Yeah, you got to rub it in.\\
132 - - Oh. - Okay.\\
133 - Would you be offended if I popped the girls out?\\
134 - What?\\
135 - You know, get a little color on Kim and Khloe.\\
136 - 'Kim and Khloe..'\\
137 - Oh, yeah, go ahead.\\
138 - - Well, - Where you going?\\
139 - Uh, I just need to do this thing that I need to do.\\
140 - Okay. I'll be right here. Take care.\\
141 -     Men       \\
142 - 'You know, I had an electric car, too, when I was little.'\\
143 - 'You know, like one of those little Barbie Jeeps.'\\
144 - Uh-huh.\\
145 - But this one time, I left it out in the rain.\\
146 - - So the battery died. - Uh-huh.\\
147 - So my dad had to drill two little holes in the floorboard\\
148 - so I could stick my feet through\\
149 - and pedal it just like Fred Flintstone.\\
150 - - Yabba-dabba-doo! - Yabba-dabba-doo!\\
151 - - Hey. - Hey. Where have you guys been?\\
152 - Uh, we went...\\
153 - Walden took me to the Santa Monica Pier.\\
154 - I actually got one of those churros.\\
155 - You know, it's like a...like a doughnut, but long and Mexican.\\
156 - Oh, hey. I'm Missi.\\
157 - Are you Alan's girlfriend?\\
158 - - Hell, no! - No!\\
159 - No, Berta is my housekeeper.\\
160 - Oh, cool. When I was in high school\\
161 - I used to clean rooms at the Howard Johnson Hotel.\\
162 - People are disgusting.\\
163 - I walked into a bathroom one time\\
164 - and it looked like a cow had exploded.\\
165 - Excuse me. That churro's heading back to the border.\\
166 - That, my friends, is what you get\\
167 - when hillbillies have unprotected sex\\
168 - with hummingbirds.\\
169 -     Men       \\
170 - No. No trouble at all, Jerry.\\
171 - She's a great kid.\\
172 - Takes after her old man.\\
173 - Uh-huh.\\
174 - Uh-huh.\\
175 - Uh-huh.\\
176 - Uh, hey, Jerry, I'm getting another call. I got..\\
177 - Uh-huh.\\
178 - Uh-huh.\\

180 - Okay, I'll talk to you, buddy.\\
181 - [knocking on door]\\
182 - - Yeah? - Hi.\\
183 - Hey, I just got off the phone with your dad.\\
184 - - He was just calling to see.. - Oh, Lord, that man can talk.\\
185 - I swear, he doesn't even pause to take a breath.\\
186 - - Do you have a sec? - Uh, sure.\\
187 - Okay, yeah, have-have a seat.\\
188 - - Uh.. - Wow.\\
189 - This is a nice bed.\\
190 - I bet you could do some serious drilling\\
191 - on a workbench like this, huh?\\
192 - Yeah. So you wanted to talk to me about something?\\
193 - Do you remember the last time that we saw each other?\\
194 - - At dinner? - No, silly.\\
195 - I'm talking about when I was, like, eight years old\\
196 - and you came to visit us, and we all went to the state fair.\\
197 - Okay, I remember that.\\
198 - Remember you had to take me and my mom\\
199 - 'cause my dad was working late?\\
200 - And we ate cotton candy for dinner, and then you won me\\
201 - that little stuffed pig in the squirt-gun horse race?\\
202 - I used to practice my kissing on him.\\
203 - Lucky pig.\\
204 - Eventually, I wore out all the terry cloth on his snout\\
205 - but it was actually okay, 'cause by that time, I changed over\\
206 - to real boys, which, turns out a couple of them were pigs, too.\\
207 - Yeah, pigs.\\
208 - Do you want a robe or a blanket or a suit of armor?\\
209 - Oh, no, no, no, no.\\
210 - I'm fine. And remember, I wanted to go on the tilt-a-whirl,\\
211 - but my mom was too scared\\
212 - so you said you'd sit next to her, but I wanted you\\
213 - to sit next to me, so you sat in between us,\\
214 - and you held both of our hands?\\
215 - But actually, you were the one that got scared\\
216 - and started praying real loud.\\
217 - "Oh, Lord, please get me off this ride!"\\
218 - I think you even tinkled a little bit.\\
219 - Oh, it's a good memory.\\
220 - I remember 'cause it was one of the best days ever.\\
221 - Aw.\\
222 - Are you lonely?\\
223 - Uh, you know, I-I got Alan.\\
224 - Yeah, but Alan doesn't keep you warm at night.\\
225 - You'd be surprised. 'Cause he, uh..\\
226 - Listen, um, I have this idea.\\
227 - You know, you might think that it's kind of crazy.\\
228 - Okay.\\
229 - I was just thinking, you know, since you're single\\
230 - and-and you're super hot and a really nice guy..\\
231 - Yeah.\\
232 - That, you know, maybe\\
233 - you'd like to hook up with my mom.\\
234 - What?\\
235 - She's been all alone ever since my daddy ran off\\
236 - with that lady from the dry cleaners..\\
237 - You know, the one with that weird eye\\
238 - that won't quite open all the way.\\
239 - Probably from all them dry cleaning fumes.\\
240 - You know, we should have seen it coming.\\
241 - She gave him all the clothes that nobody claimed.\\
242 - He had, like, four tuxedos.\\
243 - Wait. Wait.\\
244 - You want to set me up with your mom?\\
245 - She kind of always had a thing for you\\
246 - but she would kill me if I told you.\\
247 - Okay, Missi, I don't think that's a good idea..\\
248 - Just think about it, okay?\\
249 - Okay.\\
250 - Great.\\
251 - Oh, and if it helps at all\\
252 - she actually just got her boobs done.\\
253 - They actually used mine as a model.\\
254 - The doctor even put 'em in his catalogue, number 244.\\
255 - Anyone can't get 'em\\
256 - but it's kind of weird now when I walk around town\\
257 - I just keep thinking I see my boobs everywhere.\\
258 - Goodnight.\\
259 - Her mom?\\
260 -     Men       \\
261 - When did I become the guy\\
262 - that the hot 19-year-old looks at and goes\\
263 - "Hey, you'd be great for my mom?"\\
264 - Count your blessings.\\
265 - One of my patients tried to set me up\\
266 - with her 70-year-old grandmother.\\
267 - No..\\
268 - Yeah, yeah, we dated for three months\\
269 - and then, um, one day I showed up\\
270 - and she couldn't remember who I was.\\
271 - So we dated another two months.\\
272 - And, um, every day was new again\\
273 - until finally I got tired of introducing myself.\\
274 - Oh! But then six months later\\
275 - she sent me a ten-dollar check on my birthday.\\
276 - [male #1] 'Hello?'\\
277 - Jake?\\
278 - - Hey! - What are you doing here?\\
279 - I got a weekend pass, so I took a train in\\
280 - to surprise you guys.\\
281 - - Hi, soldier! - Hello.\\
282 - You must be Jake.\\
283 - I'm sleeping in your room.\\
284 - Well, God bless America.\\
285 -     Men       \\
286 -     Men       \\
287 - It is so nice to meet you. I'm Missi.\\
288 - Short for Mississippi, not Melissa.\\
289 - She got stung by a jellyfish and peed-on.\\
290 - Thank you.\\
291 - Are you, like, one of those Navy SEAL guys?\\
292 - They are so awesome.\\
293 - No, I'm just a cook.\\
294 - Well, that's cool, too.\\
295 - - Without food, everybody dies. - That's so..\\
296 - This one time, I found this\\
297 - little baby bird that fell out of a tree\\
298 - 'and landed in my backyard and he was almost dead.'\\
299 - So I started feeding him with this little eyedropper\\
300 - full of warm milk. "Eat little bird, eat little bird."\\
301 - And eat he did.\\
302 - Within a week, I was chewing up crackers\\
303 - and spitting 'em right in his mouth.\\
304 - 'And when he finally had enough strength to fly on his own.'\\
305 - - I set him free from the box. - No kidding.\\
306 - It was one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen.\\
307 - But he got about ten feet up in the air\\
308 - before my cat launched himself off that picnic table\\
309 - and caught him right in mid-air.\\
310 - I mean, he didn't even have to chew.\\
311 - Just one gulp and that bird was gone.\\
312 - But...I didn't have to feed Mr. Mittens that day.\\
313 - So I know how important food is.\\
314 - Thanks. Uh, if you're hungry\\
315 - - I could.. - I would love something to eat!\\
316 - Oh. Okay.\\
317 - Alright, well, uh..\\
318 - Welcome back!\\
319 - Good catching up.\\
320 - That was like being there the first time Beavis met Butthead.\\
321 - Wait till Beavis sees Butthead in a bikini.\\
322 - God. You remember falling that hard and fast for a girl?\\
323 - I remember the fast part.\\
324 - Kind of a relief those days are behind us, huh?\\
325 - Behind you.\\
326 - These are my days.\\
327 - - Oh, no, I wasn't saying.. - No, I am young, Alan.\\
328 - I am young!\\
329 - Fine, fine, you're young.\\
330 - Where you going?\\
331 - I don't remember.\\
332 -     Men       \\
333 - Mmm. Kid makes good chili.\\
334 - Glad you like it.\\
335 - We have enough..\\
336 - ...for a month.\\
337 - Why?\\
338 - The recipe was for a platoon\\
339 - and math is not his strong suit.\\
340 - Where'd he take "Oh, my God, this place is beautiful.\\
341 - "Does that ocean go all the way to Hawaii? I love Hawaii.\\
342 - You know alohameans hello and good-bye?"\\
343 - They went for a walk on the beach\\
344 - which, you know, has more grains of sand\\
345 - than there are stars in the entire Milky Way.\\
346 - Speaking of which, do you like Snickers or Milky Way?\\
347 - I like Three Musketeers.\\
348 - Even though I don't know what nougat is.\\
349 - Hey, what you doing?\\
350 - Missi and I are hanging out on the beach.\\
351 - Am I gonna see you at all while you're home?\\
352 - Oh, uh-huh, yeah, sure.\\
353 - - You're never gonna see him. - Hey.\\
354 - Missi told me she's trying to set you up with her mom.\\
355 - How cool would that be?\\
356 - If you married her mom and I married Missi\\
357 - you'd be my stepdad.\\
358 - Yeah, really cool.\\
359 - Alright. See you later, Dad.\\
360 - And Dad.\\
361 - You know, if they have kids, we'd be their grand pappies.\\
362 - Ow!\\
363 -     Men       \\
364 - Well, to make a long story short\\
365 - I ate all the wafers, which is why\\
366 - you should never smoke pot before you go to church.\\
367 - That's funny. This one time, me and my friend--\\
368 - Do you want to hear a joke?\\
369 - Sure.\\
370 - - What do gay horse eat? - What?\\
371 - Ha-a-a-a-y!\\
372 - Can I ask you something?\\
373 - - Any.. - Do you think I talk too much?\\
374 - No, I love listening to you talk.\\
375 - - I mean, it's funny. Normally-- - You are just so sweet.\\
376 - I swear I could just eat you up\\
377 - but, you know, then I'd probably get a sugar rush\\
378 - 'cause you are just so sweet, and if you think\\
379 - I talk a lot now, you should really hear me after I..\\
380 - Well, I am definitely gonna shut up now\\
381 - 'cause you're a really good kisser\\
382 - and the last thing I want to do is..\\
383 -     Men       \\
384 - Look at you making breakfast.\\
385 - It's what the army trains you to do\\
386 - when you keep dropping a loaded gun.\\
387 - Here, have a cup of coffee.\\
388 - Oh, thank you.\\
389 - - You want to hear a joke? - Sure.\\
390 - What do gay horses eat?\\
391 - - Mm... - Hay.\\
392 - So, uh, when do you leave for the base?\\
393 - Oh, my train leaves at 4:00.\\
394 - Mm. I'll give you a ride to the station.\\
395 - Thanks.\\
396 - You kidding? It's the only time I will get to spend with you.\\
397 - So, uh, how was sleeping on that couch last night?\\
398 - Oh, you know, it was a little lumpy\\
399 - but better than sleeping with 60 guys\\
400 - coughing, farting, and getting all romantic with themselves.\\
401 - Missi still sleeping?\\
402 - No, she's in the shower.\\
403 - Oops.\\
404 - No, it's fine.\\
405 - Sh-She seems like a nice girl.\\
406 - You have no idea.\\
407 - Well, if you'll excuse me.\\
408 - I'm gonna take her some breakfast.\\
409 - As you can imagine, we worked up quite the appetite.\\
410 - Right.\\
411 - And...when I say "worked up an appetite", you understand--\\
412 - I got it, I got it.\\
413 -     Men       \\
414 - I really loved hanging out with you this weekend.\\
415 - Cool.\\
416 - Uh...yeah.\\
417 - So, listen, I get another pass in, like, a month\\
418 - so maybe we can see each other then.\\
419 - Maybe.\\
420 - Are...you feeling alright?\\
421 - You're awful quiet.\\
422 - Well, here's the thing, Jake.\\
423 - Hang on, Dad! There's a thing!\\
424 - What's the thing?\\
425 - - I sort of have a boyfriend. - A boyfriend?\\
426 - Well, technically we broke up because I was tired of him\\
427 - always putting his career ahead of me.\\
428 - He's a doctor.\\
429 - Well, not a real doctor, a glass doctor.\\
430 - You know, like if you get a crack in your windshield\\
431 - he will come right to your driveway and fix it\\
432 - in less than half an hour, guaranteed.\\
433 - So..\\
434 - Anyway, he sent me this e-mail this morning\\
435 - saying that he wants to try things again\\
436 - but now I really like you. It's just that..\\
437 - Zach and I have been together for, like, six months\\
438 - and we even went to a wedding together.\\
439 - I can't just throw that away.\\
440 - But, I thought you..\\
441 - Good-bye, Jake.\\
442 - Don't be a hero.\\
443 - What the hell just happened?\\
444 -     Men       \\
445 -     Men       \\
446 - You and Missi make plans to see each other again?\\
447 - No.\\
448 - Why? I-I thought you two were, uh..\\
449 - I thought so, too.\\
450 - Oh.\\
451 - - If it helps-- - It doesn't.\\
452 - Okay.\\
453 - - I remember my first-- - Dad.\\
454 - Gotcha.\\
455 - Does it get any easier?\\
456 - Oh, God, no.\\
457 - But...the human mind is a wonderful thing.\\
458 - It forgets pain, so you can..\\
459 - ...go out and get some more.\\
460 - She has a boyfriend back home.\\
461 - A doctor.\\
462 - How am I supposed to compete with that?\\
463 - Let me ask you something, Jake.\\
464 - Knowing what you know now\\
465 - and feeling how you feel now..\\
466 - Would you have done anything differently?\\
467 - No.\\
468 - I just would've done it a few more times.\\
469 - There you go.\\
470 - That's what love's all about.\\
471 -     Men       \\
472 - Hey. So, I just got off the phone with my mom.\\
473 - Oh, yeah?\\
474 - She's really looking forward to hearing from you.\\
475 - Gee, I-I don't know, Missi.\\
476 - I'm...I'm not sure it's a good idea.\\
477 - I mean, I know your mom and dad aren't together anymore\\
478 - but your dad's an old friend and..\\
479 - Here's a recent picture of her.\\
480 - Then again, I haven't seen him in years. I..\\
481 - Great. I'll go tell her that you're gonna call.\\
482 - Hey, wait. Wait a second. I..\\
483 - Yeah?\\
484 - I'm flattered that you think I'd be good for your mom\\
485 - but I was just curious\\
486 - at any point in time, did you think that..\\
487 - Maybe you and me..?\\
488 - Ew.\\
489 - A simple "no" would suffice.\\

8 - I need an answer.\\
9 - There's someone else.\\
10 -     Men       \\
11 - I like that red dress on you.\\
12 - I feel like a bull.\\
13 - I want to charge.\\
14 - Speaking of charging\\
15 - did you bring your wallet this time?\\
16 - The last two times were honest mistakes.\\
17 - And I fully intend to pay you back.\\
18 - Oh, that's just great, Justin.\\
19 - If your mom says it's bath time\\
20 - by all means take a bath.\\
21 - Meanwhile the free world is falling into\\
22 - the hands of cyber-terrorists.\\
23 - You okay?\\
24 - Yeah.\\
25 - My sniper's got to get ready for Sixth Grade\\
26 - Picture Day tomorrow.\\
27 - - Oh, you guys look nice. - Oh, thanks.\\
28 - We're going out to dinner. Wanna join us?\\
29 - No, I got a...burrito in the microwave.\\
30 - Okay, enjoy.\\
31 - Oh, you did take the foil off of the--\\
32 - [crackling]\\
33 - I'll get my coat.\\
34 - Isn't that your wallet?\\
35 - Oh, uh, yes, that's, uh, uh, I-I-I put it there\\

46 - I've been playing with kids I met\\
47 - on the internet for too long.\\
48 - Now that I say that out loud, I'm really glad we did this.\\
49 - Mm-m, I'll get this.\\
50 - I'll get it.\\
51 - Oh, okay, I guess I'm really gonna get this.\\
52 - - Thanks, Al. - Oh, it's my pleasure.\\
53 - Are you crying?\\
54 - What? No, no. I have, uh, I have allergies.\\
55 - It's probably the dust from opening his wallet.\\
56 - - Damn it. - What?\\
57 - It's...Zoey and her new boyfriend.\\
58 - I am so sorry.\\
59 - This is tough.\\
60 - After what she did to you..\\
61 - Come on, let's just get this over with.\\
62 - He didn't deserve it. He gave her everything.\\
63 - He actually has things to give.\\
64 - Hi...Zoey.\\
65 - Walden, hi.\\
66 - - Lyndsey. - Hi.\\
67 - - Alan. - Pfft!\\
68 - Um, this is my friend, Peter.\\
69 - Peter.\\
70 - - Nice to meet you. - Cheers, mate.\\
71 - "Cheers, mate. We hosted the Olympics."\\
72 - This is a bit awkward.\\
73 - Why is this awkward?\\
74 - [scoffing] Oh, yes, that's right, I-I remember.\\
75 - Because you ruined my best friend's life.\\
76 - I'm-I'm sorry. Nice to meet you.\\
77 - What you did to was wanton and reprehensible.\\
78 - - Alright, keep moving. - Jezebel.\\
79 - If it makes you feel any better\\
80 - he didn't like you before.\\
81 -     Men       \\
82 - How you doing?\\
83 - - You okay? - Oh, yeah, I'm fine.\\
84 - - I mean, my heart's racing-- - I was talking to Walden.\\
85 - Yeah, I guess.\\
86 - I mean, I thought seeing her with somebody else\\
87 - would be the end of the world, but\\
88 - I'm...really okay with it.\\
89 - [scoffing] You're a better man than I am.\\
90 - We all know that, Alan.\\
91 - Yeah, I guess what I'm saying is it wasn't\\
92 - as bad as I thought it would be.\\
93 - I mean, clearly Alan has some unresolved issues\\
94 - but...I think I'm ready to move on.\\
95 - I can definitely help you there.\\
96 - Oh, uh, where you going with this, sweetie?\\
97 - I have a ton of friends who would die to go out with you.\\
98 - - Really? - Oh, yeah.\\
99 - That's true. She has some of the hottest friends you can imagine.\\
100 - Uh, that-that youcan imagine, not that I would.\\
101 - [chuckling] I mean, why would I?\\
102 - [chuckling] You're the hottest of them all, you know?\\
103 - So what's your type?\\
104 - I don't know if I have a type. I mean, I like brunettes.\\
105 - But well, I married a redhead and I've dated some blondes.\\
106 - So I guess...what I'm saying is I'm pro-hair.\\
107 - Well, in the upper deck not necessarily around the dugout.\\
108 - Ah, interesting.\\
109 - Uh, If you're gonna go with a-a baseball reference\\
110 - I would've gone with "on the mound".\\
111 - They all have hair in the appropriate places.\\
112 - What else?\\
113 - I don't know. Uh, I like a girl who's smart.\\
114 - I like a girl who's funny.\\
115 - I like a girl who's..\\
116 - ...not gonna leave me for another guy.\\
117 - Oh, oh, and no one who wears those big\\
118 - furry boots with shorts or mini-skirts.\\
119 - You're either hot or you're cold. Take a stand, ladies.\\
120 - I'll take care of it.\\
121 - So, Walden, as I told you,\\
122 - Jennifer is my Pilates instructor.\\
123 - Yeah, Pilates.\\
124 - Well, you're certainly whipping Lyndsey into shape.\\
125 - Not that you need it.\\
126 - Not that I was looking.\\
127 - Not that you're listening.\\
128 - Oh, can I take a picture of you?\\
129 - Okay.\\
130 - Uploading photo to wall.\\
131 - "Check out my hot date." Smiley face.\\
132 - LOL, right?\\
133 - So, Pilates..\\
134 - That's all about strengthening the core, right?\\
135 - Hm-m?\\
136 - O-M-G. Cat in a bow tie riding a skateboard.\\
137 - [chuckling] Re-tweeting.\\
138 - Guy in a bow tie right here.\\
139 - Oh, good news, one person already likes our date.\\
140 - Unfriend.\\
141 - So what looks good to you?\\
142 - Actually, I'm not gonna eat.\\
143 - Nothing?\\
144 - No, I'm doing a master cleanse.\\
145 - So I haven't eaten solid food in two weeks.\\
146 - Dawn, you might have mentioned that when I told you\\
147 - we were all going out to dinner.\\
148 - No, it's no problem. You guys eat.\\
149 - [chuckling] This stuff just flushes you right out.\\
150 - Well, I guess it's worth it if it rids the body\\
151 - of all those toxins and impurities.\\
152 - Right, and the stuff that comes out of you.\\
153 - I swear I found a Barbie head that I\\
154 - swallowed in the fifth grade.\\
155 - Good thing you didn't swallow her Malibu beach house.\\
156 - Ouch.\\
157 - Well, whatever you're doing, it's working. You look great.\\
158 - Thank you.\\
159 - I also inject myself with the\\
160 - urine of pregnant women.\\
161 - Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna eat either.\\
162 - It's got a hormone in it that helps you lose weight.\\
163 - [clicking tongue] Oh, which is ironic because\\
164 - pregnant women pack on the pounds.\\
165 - I will never be fat.\\
166 - Or married.\\
167 - I can't believe you created and sold your own company.\\
168 - You must be incredibly smart.\\
169 - Yeah, I don't know, I think it's more luck and timing.\\
170 - I think it takes a little bit more than luck and timing\\
171 - to make $1.4 billion.\\
172 - Somebody did their research.\\
173 - I'll bet women are after you all the time.\\
174 - I mean, you could look like him and they'd still be after you.\\
175 - I mean, I don't know..\\
176 - You know what these women are thinking, don't you?\\
177 - "I mean, is this guy gonna ask for a pre-nup?"\\
178 - 'Cause theoretically, your alimony payments would run 75\\
179 - 100 grand a month at least.\\
180 - And that's without child support.\\
181 - You're good at math.\\
182 - You know, I never thought I wanted kids...but\\
183 - with the right person\\
184 - I could see myself having an entire litter.\\
185 - And I could see myself having a vasectomy.\\
186 - [crying]\\
187 - When she's on her meds, she's actually lots of fun.\\
188 - I am.\\
189 -     Men       \\
190 - - Hey. - Hey.\\
191 - Just got off the phone with Lyndsey.\\
192 - She's got another friend.\\
193 - She says this one's perfect.\\
194 - No, no more women, Alan.\\
195 - Wait, they were all women, right?\\
196 - In the eyes of the law, yes.\\
197 - The Olympics, eh.\\
198 - Look, I-I know some of the dates didn't work out.\\
199 - Didn't work out?\\
200 - One of them used her roast chicken to show me\\
201 - where she was probed by aliens.\\
202 - Uh, but you have to admit the chicken was\\
203 - out of this world.\\
204 - You do know Lyndsey and I are just trying to help.\\
205 - Yeah, I do.\\
206 - And I appreciate it. But I think I was wrong.\\
207 - I just don't think I'm ready to date right now.\\
208 - - So you're giving up? - No, I'm not giving up.\\
209 - I just...I want to change my pattern, you know?\\
210 - My whole life I've jumped from one woman to the next.\\
211 - I thought that was just because every time you jumped\\
212 - another woman slid in under you.\\
213 - Well, there's that.\\
214 - But let's face it, Alan, I went straight from my mother's house\\
215 - to being married to Bridget\\
216 - from Bridget to dating Zoey, and\\
217 - now I'm trying to go from Zoey to a bunch of starving, crying\\
218 - gold-digging, crazy-ass bitches.\\
219 - Hey, if it weren't for those women\\
220 - I'd still be a virgin.\\
221 - And there'd be no reality TV stars.\\
222 - Look, I'm just gonna be alone for a while.\\
223 - And if the real thing comes along, I'll know it.\\
224 - Hm, that's true. You know, I can still remember the exactinstant\\
225 - that I knew Lyndsey was the one.\\
226 - How'd you know?\\
227 - Uh, she said, "I give up. You're the one."\\
228 -     Men       \\
229 - - Hey, Walden. - Hey.\\
230 - - You here by yourself? - Yes.\\
231 - I'm alone and I plan to stay that way.\\
232 - Oh, well, if you change your mind\\
233 - there's a bachelorette party in the corner with a couple\\
234 - of drunk and bitter bridesmaids.\\
235 - Fish in a barrel.\\
236 - That's good to know, but not tonight.\\
237 - Alright, what can I get you?\\
238 - - I'll have a beer. - Coming up.\\
239 - [Rose] 'Excuse me.'\\
240 - Can I have your nuts?\\
241 - - What? - Your nuts.\\
242 -     Men       \\
243 -     Men       \\
244 - Thank you.\\
245 - I'm Rose.\\
246 - - Hi, Rose. I'm-- - Walden, I know.\\
247 - I heard the bartender say, "Hey, Walden."\\
248 - I mean, how else would I know your name?\\
249 - It's nice to meet you, Rose.\\
250 - You too, Walden.\\
251 - I prefer real books.\\
252 - Some people do.\\
253 - You know why I do?\\
254 - Because if you use this\\
255 - to fix a wobbly table it costs you $800?\\
256 - No, you can't hide a gun in an iPad.\\
257 - No, I guess you can't.\\
258 - Sorry. I'll leave you alone.\\
259 - Thanks.\\
260 - [gasping]\\
261 - Oh, my God, are you okay?\\
262 - - Nut. I can't breathe. - Okay, don't panic.\\
263 - Oh.\\
264 - [sighing] Oh.\\
265 - Thank you, you saved my life.\\
266 - Can we get a glass of water over here?\\
267 - And I'll have a martini.\\
268 -     Men       \\
269 - Alright, I'm getting ready to leave.\\
270 - Do you need anything before I go?\\
271 - Mm-m, actually, if you don't mind, I could--\\
272 - Just making small talk, Zippy.\\
273 - - Hey. - Hey, how was your night?\\
274 - Great. In fact,I met a girl.\\
275 - [scoffing] Of course you did.\\
276 - I hate you, but I hate me more.\\
277 - This girl's really interesting.\\
278 - Actually, I-I think you know her. Her name is Rose.\\
279 - See ya.\\
280 - What? Rose? Crazy Rose?\\
281 - She's not crazy.\\
282 - And you know what? Name-calling is cruel.\\
283 - How would you like it if somebody called you old Alan\\
284 - or cheap Alan, or loser Alan?\\
285 - [Berta] 'Somebody does.'\\
286 - Did Rose tell you she was stalking my brother?\\
287 - Actually, she told me everything.\\
288 - You know, she was in love with him, and I get it\\
289 - when you're in love with someone\\
290 - love makes you do crazy things.\\
291 - No, crazy makes you do crazy things.\\
292 - We all have skeletons in our closets.\\
293 - Uh, yes, but in her case, they may be actual skeletons.\\
294 - You know what? She told me you were gonna do this.\\
295 - [scoffing] Of course she did.\\
296 - She's devious and deceptive.\\
297 - She's probably listening to us right now.\\
298 - Hey, Rose! How you doing?\\
299 - Alan, calm down.\\
300 - I had a conversation with the woman. I'm not marrying her.\\
301 - I don't even know if I'll ever see her again.\\
302 - [scoffing] Oh, you will.\\
303 - Trust me.\\
304 - Her face will be the last thing you see before you\\
305 - black out from the chloroform.\\
306 -     Men       \\
307 - Rose?\\
308 - Oh, Walden.\\
309 - - Hi. - Hi.\\
310 - Wait a minute. You're not stalking me, are you?\\
311 - [chuckling] Good one. No, I stop here every day on my way to work.\\
312 - It's kind of a ritual.\\
313 - Really?\\
314 - There is no way I would ever have known that.\\
315 - - Do you mind if I join you? - Please.\\
316 - How can I say no to the man who saved me\\
317 - from choking on his nuts?\\
318 - I told Alan that we met.\\
319 - - Boy, did you call that one. - Oh, let me guess.\\
320 - At some point did he say\\
321 - "She's probably listening to us right now."\\
322 - "Hey, Rose! How you doing?"\\
323 - It's like you were there.\\
324 - But I wasn't.\\
325 - Well, he-he is very suspicious of you.\\
326 - He thinks you have some kind of plan.\\
327 - Are you suspicious of me?\\
328 - I'm more curious than suspicious.\\
329 - Good, because that's my plan.\\
330 - Does your plan include\\
331 - having dinner with me?\\
332 - Oh, gee.\\
333 - - I don't know about that. - Why not?\\
334 - You live in Charlie's old house\\
335 - there's Alan.. Lots of baggage..\\
336 - None of that stuff has anything to do with us.\\
337 - That's true.\\
338 - So, what do you say? Dinner?\\
339 - Okay.\\
340 - To dinner.\\
341 - It'll be nice to go out with\\
342 - someone normal for a change.\\
343 -     Men       \\
344 - [doorbell ringing]\\
345 - [door opening]\\
346 - Hello, Alan.\\
347 - Rose.\\
348 - You've got a lot of nerve coming to this house.\\
349 - As much nerve as you have still living in it?\\
350 - Touche.\\
351 - Wow.\\
352 - This place looks fantastic.\\
353 - [scoffing] Don't act like you haven't seen it before.\\
354 - I know what you're up to.\\
355 - Oh, really? What am I up to?\\
356 - Alright, I don't know specifically what you're up to.\\
357 - But Walden is my best friend, and I will not let you hurt him.\\
358 - And he's very lucky to have\\
359 - a friend like you given what he's been through.\\
360 - Of which you know because you've been spying on us.\\
361 - J'accuse!\\
362 - No. I know because he told me.\\
363 - He's very fond of you, Alan.\\
364 - You finally made a friend. Don't screw it up.\\
365 - Oh, you're good.\\
366 - I'm totally confused right now.\\
367 - Ah, there she is.\\
368 - Hi, Walden.\\
369 - Are you two playing nice?\\
370 - Well, I am. I don't know what she's up to.\\
371 - But I know it ends with the audience yelling\\
372 - "Don't go in the cellar!"\\
373 - You're funny. He thinks I've hatched some nefarious plot.\\
374 - Are you after my money?\\
375 - No, you're thinking of Alan.\\
376 - Are youplanning on cloning me and\\
377 - run my doppelganger for President, so you can\\
378 - be the puppet master of the nation?\\
379 - Guilty. Better get a sample right now.\\
380 - [both chuckling]\\
381 - I get it hair, DNA, the whole..\\
382 - Just stop worrying. Don't you have somewhere you need to be?\\
383 - Well, as a matter of fact\\
384 - Lyndsey and I are going to the movies.\\
385 - - Have a good time. - Oh, you'd like that.\\
386 - Wouldn't you?\\
387 - Watch yourself, buddy.\\
388 - [door closing]\\
389 - - He means well. - I know.\\
390 - Can I pour you a glass of wine?\\
391 - - Yeah, that'd be great. - Alright.\\
392 - [door opening] A-ha!\\
393 - Actually, I just forgot my keys.\\
394 - And your wallet.\\
395 -     Men       \\
396 - [door opening]\\
397 - Oh, I shouldn't have eaten that whole tub of popcorn.\\
398 - I'm gonna be gassy all night.\\
399 - You know it's gonna take more than a bloated belly\\
400 - to put a muzzle on Mr. Pokey.\\
401 - [chuckling]\\
402 - - What was that? - I don't know\\
403 - But I've got a bad feeling about this.\\
404 - Ugh I've got a bad feeling about this.\\
405 - [farting]\\
406 - - Walden? - 'What happened?'\\
407 - What?\\
408 - [muffled chatter]\\
409 - I'm coming in.\\
410 - [muffled chatter]\\
411 - Don't worry, buddy. I told you she was nuts.\\
412 - Get out of here.\\
413 - - What? - Get out of here.\\
414 - I'm having the best sex of my life.\\
415 - Oh, hi, Alan.\\
416 - How was the movie?\\
417 - It was...wait, is that a leaf blower?\\
418 - That's not what they call it in Amsterdam.\\
419 - [revving]\\
420 -     Men       \\
421 -     Men       \\
422 - [computer beeping]\\
423 - Oh!\\
424 - 'Hi, Jake.'\\
425 - Rose? What are you doing there?\\
426 - I'm dating Walden.\\
427 - I should've seen that coming.\\
428 - How's the army treating you?\\
429 - How'd you know I was in the army?\\
430 - 'Cause I've been spying on you guys.\\
431 - What?\\
432 - I'm just kidding. You're wearing a uniform, silly.\\
433 - Oh, yeah, right.\\
434 - Don't worry about the obstacle course. You'll get it.\\
435 - Yeah, the rope climb is...hey, wait a second, how did you--\\
436 - Got to go, Jake. I'll tell your dad you called.\\
437 - How did I know he was in the army?\\
438 - [chuckling] So cute.\\

\subsection {Episode 06: Ferrets Attack}
1 - [Jake] Previously on "Two And A Half Men.."\\
2 - Zoey, will you do me the honor of becoming..\\
3 - ...Zoey Hyde-Tottingham-Pierce-Schmidt?\\
4 - No, I'm sorry, I can't do it.\\
5 -     She can..       \\
6 - - I need an answer. - There's someone else.\\
7 - Look, I'm just gonna be alone for a while.\\
8 - And if the real thing comes along, I'll know it.\\
9 - Excuse me... can I have your nuts?\\
10 - This girl's really interesting. Actually I think you know her.\\
11 - Her name's Rose.\\
12 - See you.\\
13 - And she's devious and deceptive.\\
14 - She's probably listening to us right now. Heh.\\
15 - Hey, Rose. How you doing?\\
16 - I told Alan that we met. Boy, did you call that one.\\
17 - Let me guess, at some point did he say\\
18 - "She's probably listening to us now!"\\
19 - "Hey, Rose! How you doing?"\\
20 - - He is very suspicious of you. - Are you suspicious of me?\\
21 - I'm more curious than suspicious.\\
22 - - Good. - So, what do you say?\\
23 - - Dinner? - To dinner.\\
24 - It will be nice to go out with someone normal for a change.\\
25 -     Men       \\
26 - [panting]\\
27 - Yay.\\
28 - Yay, indeed.\\
29 - Ooh.\\
30 - We went a mile and a half.\\
31 - What is that, a pedometer?\\
32 - Yeah, I'm measuring our sex life.\\
33 - And as of today, we are in Laughlin, Nevada.\\
34 - Well, I believe I did most of the driving.\\
35 - Yes, but when you got a flat, I stopped and pumped it up.\\
36 - [sighs]\\
37 - Call me crazy, and the state of California did for a while..\\
38 - ...but these last couple of weeks\\
39 - have been the best of my life.\\
40 - Mm. They have been great.\\
41 - With the last mile and a half being a particular high point.\\
42 - That's because you finally stopped\\
43 - and asked for directions.\\
44 - - Okay, I better get going. - Wait, no, no. stay the night.\\
45 - All my stuff is at my house, silly.\\
46 - - What stuff? - I don't know, my toothbrush.\\
47 - - You can use mine. - Ugh.\\
48 - After what we just did you're really concerned\\
49 - with having my toothbrush in your mouth?\\
50 - I'm just saying, at some point I have to go home.\\
51 - What if you never had to go home?\\
52 - Do you mean, like you're gonna tie me up\\
53 - and keep me bound and gagged in the closet?\\
54 - Uh, no.\\
55 - I was thinking more like you move in with me.\\
56 - Mm. That's a little odd.\\
57 - I mean, come on, you said so yourself\\
58 - the last few weeks have been fantastic.\\
59 - - We get along great. Why not? - Why not?\\
60 - Because I don't wanna be a flavorless cracker.\\
61 - Sure.\\
62 - What?\\
63 - Well, you know, when you order a cheese plate\\
64 - and you get two different kinds of stinky cheese\\
65 - and then you eat that little bland, unsalted cracker\\
66 - in between to cleanse your palate?\\
67 - Not really.\\
68 - But you explained it pretty well.\\
69 - Well, I don't wanna be the bland cracker.\\
70 - I wanna be the stinky cheese.\\
71 - Okay, I think I understand.\\
72 - You're concerned because I just got out\\
73 - of a serious relationship and you don't want to be the girl\\
74 - that gets me to the next one.\\
75 - - Exactly. - Well, trust me.\\
76 - You are the stinkiest cheese I have ever met.\\
77 - So sweet.\\
78 - I don't know, it's moving so quickly.\\
79 - I mean, who could've seen this coming?\\
80 - Well, I know it's moving quick.\\
81 - But I'm the kind of person when I see something I want\\
82 - I stop at nothing to get it.\\
83 - Well, I guess opposites really do attract.\\
84 - Just promise me that you'll think about it.\\
85 - And you'll think about tying me up in your closet?\\
86 - I will.\\
87 - That seems fair.\\
88 - You know if we get started now\\
89 - we could make it to Salt Lake City by daybreak.\\
90 - Ooh. Okay, but this time I'm driving.\\
91 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\
92 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\
93 -     Men men men men manly men    \\
94 -     Oo hoo hoo hoo hoo oo    \\
95 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\
96 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\
97 -     Men       \\
98 -     Men       \\
99 - I can't believe this, after everything she's done.\\
100 - I know, how did someone like that\\
101 - worm their way back in here?\\
102 - Maybe she learned from the master.\\
103 - I'm just worry she's gonna take advantage of Walden.\\
104 - You do hear yourself when you talk, right?\\
105 - Yes, yes, I'm a mooch, but I'm not dangerous.\\
106 - Some night, I'm gonna get drunk and try that.\\
107 - Here he comes, here he comes.\\
108 - - Morning. - Morning.\\
109 - Well, uh, how's everything going with my favorite couple?\\
110 - Walden and Rose.\\
111 - Wose.\\
112 - Ralden.\\
113 - Look, Alan, I know you're suspicious of her.\\
114 - But she really makes me happy.\\
115 - No, I totally get that and I don't wanna sound judgmental\\
116 - but she scares the living crap out of me.\\
117 - Well, you're gonna have to make peace with it.\\
118 - 'Cause not only do I like Rose, I asked her to move in with me.\\
119 - [Berta laughing]\\
120 - What's so funny?\\
121 - If you don't know, it's too late.\\
122 -     Men       \\
123 - [phone ringing]\\
124 - Oh, that's my cell.\\
125 - Could you grab it for me?\\
126 - It says, "Do not answer."\\
127 - Oh. That's Zoey.\\
128 - It reminds me to stay strong and not take her calls.\\
129 - Hello? Hey, Zoey. Yeah, what's going on?\\
130 - Yeah, I could do that.\\
131 - - She wants to go for coffee. - Why?\\
132 - - I don't know. - Ask her.\\
133 - Hey, uh, just so I have a heads-up, is this a..\\
134 - ...sad coffee or a happy coffee?\\
135 - - It's a happy coffee. - That's great.\\
136 - And can you bring me back a scone?\\
137 - Shut up.\\
138 - Uh, yeah, great, uh, I'll be there in 20.\\
139 - - Okay. - What do you think's going on?\\
140 - I don't know.\\
141 - Uh...she said she wants to talk in person.\\
142 - Ooh, be careful, in my experience\\
143 - when an ex wants to talk in person\\
144 - it's either to borrow money or tell you she gave you crabs.\\
145 - And no one's ever asked me for money.\\
146 - You share too much.\\
147 - Besides, she said it was a happy coffee.\\
148 - Ooh, ooh. Maybe she wants to have sex with the ex.\\
149 - That's happened to me. Be careful.\\
150 - That's how I got the crabs.\\
151 - Well, I'm not gonna sleep with her. I'm with Rose now.\\
152 - Oh, are you gonna tell Rose that you're meeting Zoey for coffee?\\
153 - Yes, I am not.\\
154 - - Good call. - Hey, how do I look?\\
155 - Like every screen-saver in San Francisco.\\
156 - Perfect. Okay.\\
157 - Hey, what does it say on your phone when I call?\\
158 - Uh, it says, "The old guy who lives downstairs."\\
159 - Perfect.\\
160 -     Men       \\
161 - Here we go, happy coffee.\\
162 - Thank you.\\
163 - - So how you been? - Mm. Good.\\
164 - - You? - Good.\\
165 - Good.\\
166 - - Are we done lying? - Mm.\\
167 - Okay, so here it is.\\
168 - Oh, God, this is very embarrassing. Heh.\\
169 - Crabs?\\
170 - - What? - Nothing. Go on.\\
171 - So when you asked me to marry you..\\
172 - ...it scared me.\\
173 - Why?\\
174 - Went down that road before, Walden. I got lost.\\
175 - Just wasn't ready to make that kind of commitment again.\\
176 - Wait a second, what about the other guy? Peter.\\
177 - I broke up with him.\\
178 - So sorry.\\
179 - Oops. Apparently, I'm not done lying.\\
180 - You care to know why I broke up with Peter?\\
181 - Because he wasn't a very good pumpkin eater?\\
182 - No, I broke up with him because when I was with him\\
183 - all I could think about was you.\\
184 - Well, this is a very happy coffee.\\
185 - I'd like another chance, Walden.\\
186 - My coffee is dancing.\\
187 - So do you wanna try and make this work?\\
188 - I do. But it's a little complicated.\\
189 - Oh, God, you're seeing someone, aren't you?\\
190 - - Well, I'm-- - Is it serious?\\
191 - Nobody's brought their toothbrush over.\\
192 - I'm sorry, I've put you in a very awkward position.\\
193 - No, no, it's okay.\\
194 - I just...I need a little time to figure it out.\\
195 - Of course you do. I completely understand.\\
196 - Take all the time you need.\\
197 - You decided yet?\\
198 - I'm kidding.\\
199 - Look, do what you need to do and let me know what happens, okay?\\
200 - - Um-- - Thanks for meeting me.\\
201 - - Yeah, I'm glad you called. - Heh-heh.\\
202 - Oh, boy.\\
203 - Crabs would've been simpler.\\
204 -     Men       \\
205 - Hey, you're not gonna believe this.\\
206 - Zoey realized she made a huge mistake and she wants me back.\\
207 - - Is that crazy, or what? - No.\\
208 - No?\\
209 - Follow me. I want to show you something.\\
210 - - Rose? - Oh, hi, sweetie.\\
211 - I brought my toothbrush.\\
212 - That's crazy.\\
213 -     Men       \\
214 -     Men       \\
215 - So...yeah, you decided to move in.\\
216 - Yep.\\
217 - You make me so happy. And now we never have to be apart.\\
218 - Never?\\
219 - - Never, ever. - Hmm.\\
220 - Now, if you'll excuse me I'm gonna go upstairs\\
221 - and make sure the birds are settled.\\
222 - - Great. - Never, ever, ever.\\
223 - Did she say birds?\\
224 - Well, I counted four, uh, but one of them\\
225 - might be dinner for the ferrets.\\
226 - - Ferrets? - I think they were ferrets.\\
227 - Might have been weasels.\\
228 - Either way, she recommended we all get rabies shots.\\
229 - Oh, God, what have I done?\\
230 - You asked her to move in.\\
231 - You invited the vampire into the house.\\
232 - Look, in my defense, the vampire was naked at the time!\\
233 - - So, what're you gonna do now? - I don't know.\\
234 - I guess, I just..\\
235 - Man up and tell Rose I made a mistake.\\
236 - Ooh, that's a bad idea.\\
237 - Especially before you get the rabies shot.\\
238 - You got a better one?\\
239 - Uh, lets see, you could always tell her that\\
240 - your work is taking you to Europe, or that you're dying\\
241 - or that you finally realized you're gay\\
242 - and sick of fighting the feelings you have for me.\\
243 - - I'm not gonna lie to her. - Would it be a lie?\\
244 -     Men       \\
245 - Look at us, we're like Siamese twins\\
246 - except we don't have to share any organs..\\
247 - ...unless we want to.\\
248 - [Walden laughs]\\
249 - Listen...I need to talk to you about something.\\
250 - Sure.\\
251 - - Jeez, this is tough. - Just say it.\\
252 - I want us to be able to talk about anything.\\
253 - Okay, here it goes. Um.\\
254 - - I'm in love with Alan. - What?\\
255 - - I'm dying. - You're dying?\\
256 - For work in Europe.\\
257 - Walden, what is going on?\\
258 - Okay. Um.\\
259 - My old girlfriend called and she wants to try again.\\
260 - How do you feel about that?\\
261 - I'd be lying if I said I wasn't thinking about it.\\
262 - Are you still in love with her?\\
263 - Yes, I am.\\
264 - I'm sorry, Rose.\\
265 - No.\\
266 - No, don't be sorry.\\
267 - Walden, we've only known each other for a couple of weeks.\\
268 - And as wonderful as it's been, if you feel that\\
269 - you'd be happier with Zoey..\\
270 - ...I'm not gonna stand in your way.\\
271 - Thank you.\\
272 - Wait, how did you know her name is Zoey?\\
273 - Zoey's a very popular name in England.\\
274 - Wait, how did you know she's English?\\
275 - Because her name's Zoey, silly.\\
276 - Goodbye, Walden.\\
277 - Goodbye, Rose.\\
278 - You know I want you to be happy, don't you?\\
279 - I do. And I want you to be happy too.\\
280 - Thank you.\\
281 - [Rose] 'Ferrets, attack!'\\
282 - [ferret's squeaking]\\
283 - Whoa!\\
284 - [ferret's squeaking]\\
285 -     Men       \\
286 - - Hey, buddy, how you doing? - Great. I got a promotion.\\
287 - Oh, no kidding.\\
288 - Yep. I'm the dessert chef in the officers' mess.\\
289 - Wow.\\
290 - Yeah, I made this killer creme brulee\\
291 - for the enlisted guys and word got out.\\
292 - Jake, I am so proud of you.\\
293 - Yeah, They gave me my own blowtorch.\\
294 - You know, to caramelize the sugar. Check it out.\\
295 - [fire alarm buzzing]\\
296 - Uh-oh. Not again.\\
297 - Gotta go, dad.\\
298 - [alarm continues]\\
299 - Well, he's America's problem now.\\
300 -     Men       \\
301 - [doorbell rings]\\
302 - Hi.\\
303 - - Hello. - Sorry to bother you.\\
304 - - I'm a friend of Walden's. - Oh, really?\\
305 - Yes, and we need to talk.\\
306 - About what?\\
307 - It's complicated.\\
308 -     Men       \\
309 - [doorbell rings]\\
310 - I'll get it.\\
311 - - Zoey. - Who the hell is..\\
312 - - What's happened to your face? - I was attacked by ferrets.\\
313 - Fine, don't tell me.\\
314 - Who the hell is that crazy woman who just showed up at my house\\
315 - saying she's carrying your baby?\\
316 - - Uh.. - I have a guess.\\
317 - Alan, please.\\
318 - Do you know anything about this?\\
319 - Alright, I'm just gonna level with you. You moved on.\\
320 - So, I was trying to do the same thing. But she's not pregnant.\\
321 - Then why in the world would she show up\\
322 - at my apartment claiming to be?\\
323 - - Apparently she's crazy. - Told you.\\
324 - Alan, shut up!\\
325 - Alright, look, as soon as you told me\\
326 - that you wanted to get back together\\
327 - I told her she had to move out because I was in love with you.\\
328 - And that's the truth. I love you, Zoey.\\
329 - Wait. She was living here?\\
330 - Did you hear the part where I said I love you?\\
331 - What happened to, "No one's brought their toothbrush?"\\
332 - Uh..\\
333 - - Alan? - You told me to shut up.\\
334 - - Oh, God. Goodbye, Walden. - No, Zoey, wait!\\
335 - You're my stinky cheese.\\
336 - - Great. - Aww.\\
337 - I'm sorry, buddy.\\
338 - - But look at the bright side. - I know, I still have you.\\
339 - Forever and ever and ever.\\
340 - Hey, why don't we go out, you know, maybe-maybe grab a bite?\\
341 - - That might cheer you up. - I don't wanna go out.\\
342 - Look, oh, you have to eat.\\
343 - You want me to pick something up for you?\\
344 - - Fine. - Great, oh, so, listen, um, I--\\
345 - - Here you go. - Thanks.\\
346 - Uh, would you mind if I take your car? Mine's out--\\
347 - Out of gas, sure.\\
348 - [Alan chuckles]\\
349 - Berta's right. I am the master.\\
350 - [keys clanking]\\
351 - Oh, boy, a radio and brakes. Heh.\\
352 - Oh, yeah, I can get used to this. Heh.\\
353 - [ferret's squeaking]\\
354 - Not the face! Not the face!\\
355 -     Men       \\
356 -     Men       \\
357 - - I've made a decision. - What's that?\\
358 - I'm never gonna care about another human being.\\
359 - Ouch.\\
360 - - Except you. - That's better.\\
361 - I can't believe I lost Zoey again.\\
362 - I can't believe I lost the tip of my pinky to a ferret.\\
363 - Boo-hoo. I have half a nipple.\\
364 - Alright, goodnight, Alan.\\
365 - Goodnight, Walden. Aah.\\

\subsection {Episode 07: Avoid the Chinese Mustard}
1 - - What are you doin' here? - I got a weekend pass.\\
2 - So I took a train in to surprise you guys.\\
3 - - Hi, soldier. - Hello.\\
4 - You must be Jake. I'm sleeping in your room.\\
5 - Well, God bless America.\\
6 - You are just so sweet.\\
7 - I swear, I could just eat you up\\
8 - but you know, then I'd probably get a sugar rush.\\
9 - - Missi still sleepin'? - Nah, she's in the shower.\\
10 - Oops.\\
11 - I get another pass in, like, a month\\
12 - so maybe we can see each other then.\\
13 - - I sort of have a boyfriend. - A boyfriend?\\
14 - But I thought you..\\
15 - Goodbye, Jake.\\
16 - Don't be a hero.\\
17 - What the hell just happened?\\
18 -     Men       \\
19 - - Hey. - Hey.\\
20 - Wait. I thought you had a date with Lyndsey tonight.\\
21 - Oh, yeah, I was supposed to\\
22 - but, uh, we decided to take a little break.\\
23 - How come?\\
24 - Oh, I'm not privy to that information.\\
25 - Uh, all I was told is, we need to take a break.\\
26 - So, what, you're supposed to just wait around\\
27 - until she decides that you're worthy\\
28 - of being in her presence again?\\
29 - Or until she needs her rain gutters cleaned out.\\
30 - And-and that's not a euphemism.\\
31 - See, this is the kind of crap\\
32 - you gotta put up with when you're in a relationship.\\
33 - Oh, but-but it's a small price to pay for love\\
34 - companionship and a parking spot\\
35 - for the pink Prius.\\
36 - It's hard to believe that Lyndsey needed a break from you.\\
37 - [doorbell rings]\\
38 - If you will excuse me\\
39 - I have a date with an extra large meat lover.\\
40 - That did not sound right.\\
41 - I ordered a pizza.\\
42 - - Walden! - Missi.\\
43 - I am so sorry to show up unannounced\\
44 - but me and my mom got in this huge fight\\
45 - over whether or not I should pay rent to stay at her house.\\
46 - And I said, "Fine, but if I pay rent\\
47 - then your stupid boyfriend should too."\\
48 - He said, "Don't sass your mother."\\
49 - I said, "Do not tell me what to do.\\
50 - I am six months older than you."\\
51 - Anyway, you said I was welcome here any time I want\\
52 - so, ding-dong, here I am.\\
53 - Alan!\\
54 - - How are you? - I'm good.\\
55 - What brings you here?\\
56 - - No! No! - Me and my..\\
57 - Hey!\\
58 - Jake, what are you doing here?\\
59 - I got a weekend pass.\\
60 - Missi?\\
61 - What are you doing here?\\
62 - Jake?\\
63 - What a surprise!\\
64 - - I'm suspicious. - You think?\\
65 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\
66 -     Huh huh-h-h men       \\
67 -     Men       \\
68 - I still just can't get over this coincidence.\\
69 - I mean, what are the odds?\\
70 - The same weekend I come home, Missi just happ--\\
71 - Jake, let it go.\\
72 - Missi, help me out here. I thought you guys broke up.\\
73 - We did, but then Jake sent me this giant cookie he baked\\
74 - that was shaped like a heart, and it said, "I Missi you"\\
75 - and I just melted.\\
76 - Well, you know, I can't take all the credit.\\
77 - The cookie was loaded with pot.\\
78 - So, uh..\\
79 - ...Jake, you wanna go to your bedroom and unpack?\\
80 - Uh, that's okay. I don't really have much.\\
81 - Well, then maybe\\
82 - you could help me unpack.\\
83 - Why?\\
84 - Dude, she's not really talking\\
85 - about unpacking.\\
86 - Oh, oh, okay, yeah\\
87 - I could definitely go for a good unpacking.\\
88 - Well, then, come on.\\
89 - Hey, um, maybe later we could go for a walk on the beach.\\
90 - Oh, yeah!\\
91 - She means an actual walk on the beach!\\
92 - - That's it. I'm out of here. - Where are you going?\\
93 - Someplace quiet.\\
94 - What are you talking about? It's quiet here.\\
95 - Wait for it.\\
96 - [Missi] 'Jake, slow down.'\\
97 - 'There's a zipper on this thing.'\\
98 - Oh, God, I can't hear my son having sex.\\
99 -     Oh yeah    \\
100 -     Push it good    \\
101 -     Ah push it..       \\
102 - Much better.\\
103 -     Men       \\
104 - Wow!\\
105 - - Excuse me? - I'm sorry.\\
106 - That-that was involuntary.\\
107 - I just think you're very beautiful.\\
108 - Thank you.\\
109 - If we weren't in a library, I would have applauded.\\
110 - Got it.\\
111 - Thanks.\\
112 - I'm sorry. What are you doing here?\\
113 - Nobody goes to the library anymore.\\
114 - Oh, it's one of the few places that I can go to\\
115 - where strange men don't hit on me.\\
116 - Oh.\\
117 - Sorry. I just..\\
118 - I'll leave you alone.\\
119 - I come here 'cause they have a great collection\\
120 - of Thomas Edison diaries.\\
121 - They're very illuminating.\\
122 - Get it? Thomas Edison's?\\
123 - The light bulb?\\
124 - Never mind.\\
125 - Just for the record, I wasn't hitting on you.\\
126 - I was just making small talk.\\
127 - Duly noted.\\
128 - The last thing I would want to do is hit on anyone.\\
129 - I'm-I'm kind of taking a timeout from the whole\\
130 - boy meets girl, girl dumps boy\\
131 - boy doubts his worth as a human being thing.\\
132 - - Okay. - Okay.\\
133 - Oh, for God's sake. Would you like to join me?\\
134 - Oh, no, no, no. I don't wanna impose.\\
135 - Just get over here.\\
136 - - Walden. - Whitney.\\
137 - Hi. So, Whitney, tell me about yourself.\\
138 - What do you do?\\
139 - Um, I'm an actress.\\
140 - Oh, yeah. How's that goin'?\\
141 - Not so good.\\
142 - I haven't worked in almost two years.\\
143 - Ooh.\\
144 - Tough business or are you just not talented?\\
145 - What do you mean, am I just not talented?\\
146 - You don't know me, you don't know what I can do.\\
147 - You're lucky that I don't reach under this table right now\\
148 - rip off your balls and feed them to you for dinner.\\
149 - I'm sorry. My bad.\\
150 - And scene.\\
151 -     Men       \\
152 - - Hey. - Hey.\\
153 - - Where's Missi? - She's unpacking.\\
154 - - You know, for real. - Right.\\
155 - I'm-I'm glad you're having fun.\\
156 - Oh, I am. I can't imagine ever being with anyone else.\\
157 - Yeah, yeah, I remember that feelin'.\\
158 - You, uh, kiss a girl, see fireworks\\
159 - and fall head over heels in love\\
160 - and then, one day you wake up in a cold, loveless marriage\\
161 - with a soul sucking shrew\\
162 - who makes you wish for an early death.\\
163 - Oh, you realize you're talking about my mother?\\
164 - Yeah. So you get it.\\
165 -     Men       \\
166 - So, anyway, after I moved out to Los Angeles\\
167 - I promised myself I'd give it two years\\
168 - and if I wasn't a star by then\\
169 - I'd move home and get a real job.\\
170 - So how much time do you have left?\\
171 - Eleven days.\\
172 - Well, that's four more than God took.\\
173 - God didn't have my agent.\\
174 - Listen, if I could hire you to act, I would.\\
175 - Thank you. I appreciate that.\\
176 - You know, what if I could hire you?\\
177 - For what?\\
178 - Well, stick with me 'cause I'm just thinking out loud here.\\
179 - You see, here's the thing.\\
180 - I'm a serial monogamist\\
181 - but I'm not very good at relationships\\
182 - 'cause they're emotional\\
183 - and they get messy, people fall in and out of love\\
184 - and somebody always ends up crying.\\
185 - And that's usually me.\\
186 - Walden, I'm not gonna date you.\\
187 - Oh, no, I-I don't want you to date me.\\
188 - What if I hired you to play\\
189 - the role of my girlfriend?\\
190 - You think I'm a hooker?\\
191 - No. No. No. No sex.\\
192 - Uh, you know, take sex off the table.\\
193 - In fact, take it off the table\\
194 - the car, the floor, the bed\\
195 - the windmill at the putt-putt golf course.\\
196 - Okay, so\\
197 - I'm supposed to just believe that some random guy\\
198 - that I meet in the public library is going to pay me\\
199 - to be his sex-free companion?\\
200 - How does this not end with my head in a freezer?\\
201 - - Google me. - What?\\
202 - Walden Schmidt. Google me.\\
203 - Wow, that's a lot of zeros.\\
204 - Are you really a-a genius entrepreneur, philanthropist?\\
205 - I also fight crime.\\
206 - What do you say?\\
207 - You know how weird this is, right?\\
208 - What is weird about wanting to control every aspect\\
209 - of a relationship by using money as a weapon?\\
210 - Okay, let me rephrase that.\\
211 - How does five grand a week sound?\\
212 - Sounds like you've got a girlfriend.\\
213 -     Men       \\
214 - - Mornin'. - Mornin'.\\
215 - - Where's Jake? - Oh, he's still sleeping.\\
216 - 'Cause in the army he has to get up at four in the mornin'.\\
217 - In the military, that's 0400.\\
218 - I don't understand why they need the O or the hundred.\\
219 - What time is it? Four. Boom! Done! Next!\\
220 - And I really don't understand\\
221 - them watches without the numbers on it.\\
222 - - I mean, I never know what-- - 'Missi?'\\
223 - I love you dearly, but you got to shut up.\\
224 - Well, all I heard was you love me dearly.\\
225 - Oh, you're here.\\
226 - And action.\\
227 - You're adorable.\\
228 - I brought you an iced coffee, no sugar, soy milk.\\
229 - That's exactly the way that I like it.\\
230 - - How did you know? - You're my boyfriend.\\
231 - It's my business to know.\\
232 - Okay, so, here's what I'm thinking.\\
233 - Three words. Beer, wings, football.\\
234 - Okay, three more words best girlfriend ever.\\
235 - - I'll just go get changed. - Why?\\
236 - Oh, this is a smelly old shirt and I haven't showered.\\
237 - Stinky, just the way I like it.\\
238 - Oh, this is good.\\
239 - Can I fart in the car?\\
240 -     Men       \\
241 - - Hello? - Sorry to disturb you, sir.\\
242 - Is this the residence of Private Jake Harper?\\
243 - Yes, it is. Is everything okay?\\
244 - No, sir. He's absent without leave.\\
245 - H-he's AWOL?\\
246 - Now we both have said it.\\
247 - If he doesn't return to the base within 24 hours\\
248 - he will be brought up on charges.\\
249 - Oh. That's not good.\\
250 - No, sir. It's bad.\\
251 - Uh, well, I-I-I, I haven't, I haven't seen him.\\
252 - Uh, but, you know, if I, if I do, I will, uh\\
253 - I will get in touch right away.\\
254 - Uh, immediately.\\
255 - - Thank you, sir. - Okay.\\
256 - Here's our contact information.\\
257 - Good day, sir.\\
258 - [laughter]\\
259 - [Missi] 'Jake!'\\
260 - Jake!\\
261 - [Jake] 'Not now, dad.'\\
262 - The military police were at the door\\
263 - looking for you.\\
264 - - What did you tell them? - I told them you weren't here.\\
265 - Oh, thanks. See you at dinner.\\
266 -     Men       \\
267 -     Men       \\
268 - Are you kidding me, Jake? AWOL?\\
269 - Come on, it's not that big a deal.\\
270 - You could go to jail!\\
271 - Really? That seems a little extreme.\\
272 - Alright, alright, enough. Just-just go get your things.\\
273 - and I'll drive you back to the base.\\
274 - No. I'm staying here with Missi.\\
275 - This is not a discussion. Let's go!\\
276 - Dad, I'm not a kid anymore. I'm 18 and I'm in the army.\\
277 - You're using the excuse that you're in the army\\
278 - to not go back to the army?\\
279 - Hey, why don't you let me go try to talk to him?\\
280 - You think you can bring him back to his senses?\\
281 - Oh, yeah, I'm real good at getting people\\
282 - to do what I want 'em to do.\\
283 - Back home they call me the people whisperer.\\
284 - It's kind of like the horse whisperer\\
285 - except I do it with people and I don't really whisper.\\
286 - Ooh, I tried it with a horse one time.\\
287 - He was just looking at me like I was crazy.\\
288 - Kind of like you're doing right now.\\
289 - I'll go talk to Jake.\\
290 - She cannot become my daughter-in-law.\\
291 - Oh, good, you're going back.\\
292 - Nope. You and me are getting out of here.\\
293 - - Where are we going? - Doesn't matter.\\
294 - I just wanna be with you.\\
295 - Jake, I got to go back home. I have a job.\\
296 - Hey, if I can leave the army, you can leave your job.\\
297 - Whoa, slow down.\\
298 - Why? I love you and you love me, right?\\
299 - Right?\\
300 - Jake...you have to know how much I really like you.\\
301 - Oh, man.\\
302 - But...you're in good company\\
303 - 'cause I only really like great things.\\
304 - You know, like, ice cream sundaes\\
305 - and jumping up and down on bubble wrap\\
306 - and that cute little bear in the toilet paper commercial\\
307 - that wipes his butt on the tree.\\
308 - Okay, I heard it that time. I do got to shut up.\\
309 -     Men       \\
310 - [crowd cheering]\\
311 - I brought you another beer.\\
312 - [grunts]\\
313 - I don't know if I should.\\
314 - Oh, come on, drunk guys are hot.\\
315 - You know, I got to tell you, Whitney\\
316 - I am having the best time with you.\\
317 - Good 'cause..\\
318 - ...I think you're wonderful.\\
319 - Thanks.\\
320 - - Do you really mean that? - Of course, I do.\\
321 - You're smart, you're funny\\
322 - not to mention very handsome.\\
323 - Ah. Too late, you mentioned it.\\
324 - You know, but seriously..\\
325 - ...I am so glad I met you.\\
326 - Thanks. Me too.\\
327 - See, here's the thing.\\
328 - - I really mean it. - So do I.\\
329 - Okay, see, I don't know if you're just saying that\\
330 - because I'm paying you or if you really believe it.\\
331 - How does it feel to you?\\
332 - It feels like you mean it.\\
333 - Then that's all that matters.\\
334 - Wh...no, it's not.\\
335 - See...I wanna know\\
336 - if it's for real real\\
337 - or if it's best performance by a girlfriend\\
338 - hired in a library real.\\
339 - Because on my end, it is real.\\
340 - Me too.\\
341 - Okay, if I wasn't paying you\\
342 - would you still feel that?\\
343 - It wouldn't matter if you were paying me or not.\\
344 - But I am paying you.\\
345 - Which doesn't change the way I feel.\\
346 - Okay, let's try this another way.\\
347 - I want you to feel\\
348 - that it's really real\\
349 - for real real.\\
350 - And that is exactly how I feel.\\
351 - Son of a bitch!\\
352 -     Men       \\
353 - - Hey. - Hey.\\
354 - - You okay? - What do you care?\\
355 - Come on, Jake, you know I care.\\
356 - I feel so stupid.\\
357 - No.\\
358 - You're not stupid.\\
359 - You wanna hear stupid?\\
360 - One time I drank an entire blueberry Slurpee in one slurp\\
361 - had a three-hour brain freeze and my pee looked like Windex.\\
362 - What the hell are you talking about?\\
363 - I don't know, I'm not real good with silence.\\
364 - Just...promise me you'll go back to the army.\\
365 - Yeah, I'm going back.\\
366 - Good.\\
367 - Hey..\\
368 - ...we did have some fun, though, right?\\
369 - Yeah, we did.\\
370 - Well, just remember that part.\\
371 - Goodbye, Jake.\\
372 - Where am I gonna find another girl named Missi?\\
373 -     Men       \\
374 - Hey.\\
375 - Hey.\\
376 - Where's your new girlfriend?\\
377 - Ah, she's off for the day.\\
378 - Where's your boyfriend?\\
379 - We...kind of broke up.\\
380 - How come?\\
381 - You know, I just thought I was coming here for a fun weekend\\
382 - no strings attached, but..\\
383 - ...then Jake told me that he loved me\\
384 - and I just couldn't say it back.\\
385 - - Ouch. - I wasn't trying to hurt him.\\
386 - It's just..\\
387 - ...he's not my soul mate.\\
388 - Well, I hate to break it to you..\\
389 - ...but...there is no such thing.\\
390 - That's not true. Everybody has a soul mate.\\
391 - And when you find yours, it's like that feeling you get\\
392 - after the first big snowfall of the year.\\
393 - 'You race outside to go sledding'\\
394 - and you go to the top of the steepest hill you can find\\
395 - and you know, your heart starts racing and you get all sweaty\\
396 - even though all your boogers are frozen over and..\\
397 - ...the next thing you know, you are zipping down\\
398 - Montague Street laughing and crying all at the same time\\
399 - and you never want it to end.\\
400 - And that's what real love should feel like.\\
401 - Nobody should settle for anything less.\\
402 - Remember when I told you to shut up earlier?\\
403 - - I'm sorry. I know. - No.\\
404 - Don't ever listen to me again.\\
405 - 'Cause that was awesome.\\
406 - Where you going?\\
407 - I'm gonna go see if my girlfriend\\
408 - wants to really be my girlfriend.\\
409 - And the people whisperer strikes again.\\
410 -     Men       \\
411 - And we're flying down the hill\\
412 - and you're all sweaty\\
413 - and there are, like, boogers frozen everywhere\\
414 - and...the point is-is\\
415 - I wanna share that feeling with you.\\
416 - For real.\\
417 - I'm gay.\\
418 - What?\\
419 - I like women.\\
420 - For real?\\
421 - For real.\\
422 - Wow.\\
423 - You're a really good actor.\\
424 - Thank you.\\
425 - Hey, do you wanna go to a movie tomorrow?\\
426 - Sure, yeah. That sounds great.\\
427 - I love you.\\
428 - Love you too, honey.\\
429 -     Men       \\
430 -     Men       \\
431 - You alright, buddy?\\
432 - I'm fine.\\
433 - It's okay to be upset.\\
434 - I'm not upset.\\
435 - If you were, I-I would understand.\\
436 - I mean, you give yourself to somebody\\
437 - you finally let down all your walls and..\\
438 - ...then they break your heart.\\
439 - Yeah.\\
440 - I'm really sorry you have to go through this.\\
441 - I mean....it just, it kills me to see you in pain.\\
442 - I mean, I-I know you're a soldier now\\
443 - but...you're still my little baby boy.\\
444 - You know, I-I remember bringing you home from the hospital\\
445 - wrapped in your fuzzy blue blanket.\\
446 - I love you so much.\\
447 - I just, I-I just wish I hurt instead of you.\\
448 - Dad...it's okay.\\
449 - No, no, it's not okay!\\
450 - Maybe I should drive.\\
451 - Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.\\
452 - Thank you.\\
453 -     Men       \\
454 - All I'm saying is, you can't give up.\\
455 - Your soul mate's out there.\\
456 - Yeah, I don't know, Missi.\\
457 - You just got to keep your eyes and your heart open.\\
458 - You know, you never know where you're gonna find her.\\
459 - She could be anywhere right now.\\
460 - Hey, she might even be at a Costco, wearing an apron\\
461 - passing out egg rolls, so you can sample the dipping sauce.\\
462 - Little tip, avoid the Chinese mustard.\\
463 - Feels good going in, not so good coming out.\\
464 - Well, let's just hope I find her before I get old.\\
465 - Ooh, then you better hurry up, grandpa.\\
466 - Hey, let's make a deal.\\
467 - Next time you're in town, assuming you haven't\\
468 - found anyone and I haven't found anyone\\
469 - what do you say that you and I--\\
470 - Ew!\\
471 - I was gonna say help each other find someone!\\
472 -     Men       \\
473 -     Ooo-oo men men men men manly men men men    \\
474 -     Men men men men manly men Oo hoo hoo hoo hoo oo    \\
475 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\
476 -     Oo-oo men men men men manly men men men    \\
477 -     Huh huh-h-h men       
\subsection {Episode 08: Something My Gynecologist Said}
1 -     Men       \\
2 - Feel like I spent the last half hour yodeling in a cave.\\
3 - I'm sorry. It wasn't you.\\
4 - No, it was, it was like licking a lollipop\\
5 - that never gets any smaller.\\
6 - I mean, you enjoy it, but after a while\\
7 - you start to crave the stick.\\
8 - Did I at least make you crave the stick?\\
9 - You did great. I'm just... a little distracted.\\
10 - - Is everything okay? - Not really.\\
11 - - We need to talk. - Oh, come on.\\
12 - I got lockjaw and you wanna talk?\\
13 - I-I wanna know where we're going with this relationship.\\
14 - Do we have any kind of a future?\\
15 - Of course, we do. I mean, th-things are good.\\
16 - Th-things are great. Why rock the boat?\\
17 - I mean, I know the little man inside your boat\\
18 - could use some rocking.\\
19 - I'm talking about making a long term commitment to each other.\\
20 - You mean like marriage?\\
21 - - Would that be so awful? - Ask my ex-wife.\\
22 - Her statement in court read like a Stephen King novel.\\
23 - W-where is this coming from all of a sudden?\\
24 - It was something my gynecologist said.\\
25 - - Are you alright? - I-I'm fine.\\
26 - He said, "Everything looks great down here.\\
27 - Would you like to have dinner sometime?"\\
28 - Wow. Wow.\\
29 - Uh, that is wildly inappropriate.\\
30 - - I mean, a-as a doctor myself-- - You're a chiropractor.\\
31 - Nonetheless, I am a healer. There's a code!\\
32 - I mean, you don't, you don't ask someone out\\
33 - when they're buck naked with their feet in the stirrups.\\
34 - Unless you're drunk at a rodeo.\\
35 - Well, he did.\\
36 - Do you wanna go out with him?\\
37 - It's not about going out with him.\\
38 - But if you and I don't have a future\\
39 - I need to examine my options.\\
40 - The way you got examined by Dr. Busy Fingers?\\
41 - Look, I don't wanna grow old alone.\\
42 - So, if you're not ready to make this kind of commitment\\
43 - better to know now.\\
44 - Jeez, Lyndsey, you k-kinda sprung this on me.\\
45 - I mean, I don't have to give you an answer\\
46 - just this second, do I?\\
47 - No, no, of course not.\\
48 - - Just think about it. - Okay.\\
49 - - Goodnight. - Goodnight.\\
50 - [sighs]\\
51 - And just for the record, he gets paid to go down there.\\
52 - I do it for the love of the game.\\
53 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\
54 -     Ha ah ha-a-ah        Men       \\
55 -     Men       \\
56 - Hey.\\
57 - Oh, hey, can I borrow your car?\\
58 - I need to take my bike into the shop\\
59 - and it won't fit in mine.\\
60 - Sure. No problem.\\
61 - Thanks.\\
62 - I assume it needs gas?\\
63 - And oil.\\
64 - And brake fluid.\\
65 - And wiper blades.\\
66 - So, uh, what are you reading?\\
67 - I'm trying to finish "Ulysses."\\
68 - Oh, that's a tough one.\\
69 - How long you been reading it?\\
70 - Fourteen years.\\
71 - I'm on page eight.\\
72 - Impressive.\\
73 - I'm still on the first "Tuesday With Morrie."\\
74 - He dies in the end.\\
75 - Thank you.\\
76 - So, listen, I-I-I wanna ask your opinion about something.\\
77 - Lyndsey has been pushing me to make a commitment\\
78 - 'cause some other guy asked her out.\\
79 - - Who asked her out? - Her gynecologist.\\
80 - Well, at least he knows what he's getting into.\\
81 - Cute.\\
82 - But I-I-I mean, I don't want to\\
83 - lose Lyndsey, but I'm just not\\
84 - ready to make a commitment.\\
85 - My advice is you better do something soon\\
86 - or you're out and the doctor's in.\\
87 - And when I say, "The doctor's in," I mean--\\
88 - No, I got it, I gotit.\\
89 - Alright, I got to get out of here.\\
90 - Oh, here you go.\\
91 - Oh, uh, the driver's side door doesn't work anymore\\
92 - so either get in the passenger side\\
93 - or climb in through the window.\\
94 - - Got it. - Oh!\\
95 - And whatever you do\\
96 - when you put the key in the ignition\\
97 - make sure you're holding something rubber.\\
98 - You know, so you're grounded.\\
99 - Does Lyndsey have a nice car?\\
100 - - Yeah. - Marry her.\\
101 -     Men       \\
102 -     And he's holding her in his arms    \\
103 -     Late late at night    \\
104 -     You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl    \\
105 -     I wish that I had Jessie's girl    \\
106 -     Where can I find a woman like that    \\
107 -     I'll play along with this charade..      \\
108 - [engine sputtering]\\
109 - Alan!\\
110 - Ah! Ow! Ow!\\
111 - Everything okay?\\
112 - Oh, yeah.\\
113 - I think it just overheated.\\
114 - Can I give you a ride to a gas station?\\
115 - Uh, gee, I don't know.\\
116 - My mom always told me never to get in a car with a stranger.\\
117 - I'm Shari McMartin.\\
118 - Solves that problem.\\
119 -     Men       \\
120 - Thank you. I really appreciate it.\\
121 - Oh, no problem.\\
122 - So your old Volvo's seen better days, huh?\\
123 - [chuckles] Yeah, it's actually, it's not mine.\\
124 - I borrowed it from a friend to get my bike fixed.\\
125 - You ride a bike around town?\\
126 - You must have amazing stamina.\\
127 - Well, it's not the only way that I get around.\\
128 - Hey, it's nothing to be ashamed about.\\
129 - With the price of gas being what it is\\
130 - a bicycle is very practical.\\
131 - I'm-I'm not ashamed.\\
132 - Trust me, there will come a day when you won't\\
133 - have to worry about having enough money for gas.\\
134 - Okay.\\
135 - I look forward to that day.\\
136 - So what's your name?\\
137 - - Walden. - That's a nice name.\\
138 - What are you doing in Los Angeles, Walden?\\
139 - You trying to be an actor or..\\
140 - ...model or something?\\
141 - Right now, I'm trying to finish a book.\\
142 - Oh. How long have you been at it?\\
143 - - Fourteen years. - Oh, a struggling writer.\\
144 - - Yes. Yes, I am. - Well, you're in luck.\\
145 - I happen to be a big supporter of the arts.\\
146 - Oh, really? How fortuitous.\\
147 - Ooh, "Fortuitous." You are a writer.\\
148 - Listen, uh, what do you say we go grab a bite to eat\\
149 - get the car fixed later?\\
150 - Sure. There's-there's a really great deli right up here.\\
151 - Well, actually, I have a better place in mind.\\
152 - - Where's that? - My house.\\
153 - Oh. What's on the menu there?\\
154 - Oh.\\
155 - Yum.\\
156 -     Men       \\
157 - - Hi. - Hi.\\
158 - What you doin'?\\
159 - [Lyndsey on screen] Nothing much.\\
160 - How about we go out to a movie?\\
161 - - Sure, we could do that. - Great, great.\\
162 - I will check some times.\\
163 - - 'Alan?' - Yeah?\\
164 - Did you think about what we discussed last night?\\
165 - Oh, yes, oh, yes.\\
166 - Thinking about it constantly.\\
167 - Anything you wanna talk about?\\
168 - Not yet. Still thinkin'.\\
169 - Uh, you know, uh, percolating, uh, mulling.\\
170 - All the other pertinent "ings."\\
171 - Ooh, ooh, uh, uh, cogitating!\\
172 - Stalling, avoiding, ducking.\\
173 - Ooh! Procrastinating.\\
174 - What? No, no. That's, that's crazy.\\
175 - I'm not, I'm not doing any of those things.\\
176 - I mean, why would I do those things?\\
177 - So what movie would you like to see?\\
178 - I know what you're doing. This is not gonna go away.\\
179 - Look, I just don't understand\\
180 - why we can't keep things the way they are.\\
181 - You mean, living day-to-day\\
182 - never knowing what kind of future you have with the person\\
183 - you've been in a relationship with the past three years?\\
184 - Okay, I-I-I prefer to think of it as cherishingeach day\\
185 - nay each moment with the woman I love\\
186 - because none of us knows how much time we have left.\\
187 - I mean, it-it-it could all disappear\\
188 - in the, in the blink of an eye.\\
189 - You mean like this?\\
190 - Exactly.\\
191 -     Men       \\
192 - Well, it would appear that a bicycle's not the only thing\\
193 - you can ride.\\
194 - I'm also good with bulls and merry-go-rounds.\\
195 - Did you enjoy your lunch?\\
196 - Oh, yeah.\\
197 - I would definitely eat here again.\\
198 - Mm. Mm.\\
199 - Do you mind taking a taxi home?\\
200 - Uh, sure, no problem.\\
201 - I'd drive you, I just have some things to do.\\
202 - Okay.\\
203 - So...then we're done here?\\
204 - I am.\\
205 - Okay. Alrighty then.\\
206 - You know, uh, we should do this again.\\
207 - Oh, we will. I'll let you know when.\\
208 - - Alrighty. - Oh...here.\\
209 - What's this?\\
210 - - It's money for a taxi. - I don't need that.\\
211 - Sweetie, don't be proud. Take the money.\\
212 - Okay, great.\\
213 - Thank you.\\
214 -     Men       \\
215 -     Men       \\
216 - - Hey, hey! - Hey!\\
217 - Where have you been?\\
218 - I got some good news and I got some bad news for ya.\\
219 - What's the bad news?\\
220 - Your car overheated and broke down.\\
221 - Ah! I should have told you not to turn on the radio.\\
222 - So, uh, what's the good news?\\
223 - This beautiful woman pulls up\\
224 - in a Bentley and offers me help\\
225 - and then she takes me back to her house\\
226 - and bangs my brains out.\\
227 - H-h-how is that good news for me?\\
228 - Oh, sorry, I misspoke.\\
229 - The bad news was for you\\
230 - the good news was for me.\\
231 - Do you have any idea how many times I've been stranded\\
232 - by the side of the road 'cause of that car?\\
233 - The only person who ever stopped was a truck driver\\
234 - with no pants and drawn-on eyebrows.\\
235 - She also gave me money for a taxi.\\
236 - - I hate you. - I know, right?\\
237 - How was your day?\\
238 - I'm pretty sure Lyndsey and I broke up.\\
239 - Oh, man.\\
240 - I'm sorry.\\
241 - I-I really liked Lyndsey. I thought she was great.\\
242 - Yeah, well, she is great, but I'm not gonna be bullied\\
243 - into spending the rest of my life with somebody\\
244 - just 'cause they're great.\\
245 - Who would? It's like being forced to win the lotto.\\
246 - Wait a minute. If you took a cab home, where's my car?\\
247 - Huh.\\
248 - Here's a 100 bucks. Buy a better car.\\
249 -     Men       \\
250 - So, you ready for round two?\\
251 - Oh, right now?\\
252 - Um, well, could we just talk a little\\
253 - while...the boys, you know, restock the shelves?\\
254 - Yeah, sure, let's talk.\\
255 - Um, how are things... going with your book?\\
256 - How's...with the what?\\
257 - Your book? The one you're trying to finish?\\
258 - Oh, about the book..\\
259 - Good.\\
260 - It's good.\\
261 - It's going good.\\
262 - Writing words.\\
263 - Making sentences.\\
264 - What's it about?\\
265 - Okay, um...yeah.\\
266 - It's about this, uh..\\
267 - ...guy...named Alan.\\
268 - Mm-hmm.\\
269 - He, and he-he lives with his brother\\
270 - in this, uh, fabulous Malibu beach house.\\
271 - And?\\
272 - And...the brother dies.\\
273 - He falls in front of a train in Paris.\\
274 - Wow. Didn't see that coming.\\
275 - Neither did he.\\
276 - Anyway, this, uh, this billionaire named Wal...ter\\
277 - comes along and he buys the house\\
278 - and then, and Alan continues to live there.\\
279 - Wait. With a complete stranger?\\
280 - Yeah.\\
281 - - Are they gay? - No. No, no.\\
282 - They-they're just, they're just friends.\\
283 - That's a bit far-fetched, isn't it?\\
284 - What? No.\\
285 - That's totally plausible.\\
286 - They have these adventures together.\\
287 - It's funny.\\
288 - It's a good thing you're pretty.\\
289 -     Men       \\
290 - Hey.\\
291 - Whoa!\\
292 - Look at you. Bought some new clothes, huh?\\
293 - Nope.\\
294 - Somebody bought new clothes for me.\\
295 - Shari took her boy toy shopping in Beverly Hills.\\
296 - I felt like Julia Roberts in "Pretty Woman."\\
297 - The only thing I got from the truck driver\\
298 - was a pack of cigarettes and an eyebrow pencil.\\
299 - Yeah, I gotta tell you, it is nice\\
300 - to be taken care of for a change.\\
301 - Well, look who I'm talkin' to.\\
302 - Alright, I'm gonna go do some manscaping.\\
303 - Mama like me smooth.\\
304 - [Skype call tone]\\
305 - - Oh, hey, buddy. - Hey, dad.\\
306 - Well, this is a nice surprise. W-what's going on?\\
307 - Well, I heard from Eldridge that you and his mom broke up\\
308 - so I'm just checking in to see how you're doing.\\
309 - That is really sweet of you, Jake\\
310 - to be concerned about your old man.\\
311 - Well, I love you, dad.\\
312 - - I want you to be happy. - Thank you.\\
313 - And, you know, you've always been there for me.\\
314 - Now I get to be here for you.\\
315 - That's true.\\
316 - - Speaking of which-- - How much?\\
317 - A couple of 100 bucks would make it a Merry Christmas\\
318 - for all the people I love.\\
319 - Alright, Jake, I'll take care of it.\\
320 - Oh, thank you, dad. Love you, bye.\\
321 - Bye.\\
322 - Totally worked! We're going to Tijuana!\\
323 - Totally worked. He thinks I'm sending him money.\\
324 -     Men       \\
325 - Um. Excuse me. Is this seat taken?\\
326 - Sit.\\
327 - But if a lady comes along\\
328 - I'm gonna have to ask you to vacate.\\
329 - Right back at you.\\
330 - I'm not worried.\\
331 - - Sid Olsen. - Oh. Nice to meet you.\\
332 - Uh, Alan Harper.\\
333 - So, Alvin, you play the ponies?\\
334 - Uh, I'm not much of a gambler.\\
335 - I don't know, that shirt's kind of a gamble.\\
336 - So, uh, what, uh, brings you in here, Sid?\\
337 - Besides dispensing fashion advice?\\
338 - I like to get out, make the rounds\\
339 - you know, talk to the young people.\\
340 - But I'll talk to you until one comes along.\\
341 - Whether I like it or not.\\
342 - Oh, I got some more advice for you, Albert.\\
343 - When you get to be my age\\
344 - always bring a big plastic cup into the john.\\
345 - Why?\\
346 - You gotta lower the water level\\
347 - or your nuts get wet.\\
348 - Oh, excuse me, darlin', darlin'.\\
349 - Could we have some more wings, please?\\
350 - I'll have a beer, please.\\
351 - You know, it's all-you-can-eat for $6.99.\\
352 - It's also dollar beers.\\
353 - Yeah, I don't drink beer. It gives me the wind.\\
354 - What's your problem, Alfred?\\
355 - - I don't have a problem. - Oh, come on.\\
356 - You're in a bar at four o'clock in the afternoon\\
357 - talking to an 80-year-old man about his balls.\\
358 - You got a problem.\\
359 - Fine. I-I guess, uh, I've been having relationship issues.\\
360 - Ah, I get it. I'm having trouble with my wife.\\
361 - - What's the matter? - She's dead.\\
362 - Oh, oh, I'm, I'm sorry.\\
363 - Ah, so am I.\\
364 - If she were still alive, I wouldn't have to be\\
365 - talking to you.\\
366 - Now we both wish she was alive.\\
367 - Zing.\\
368 - Our marriage was the best 30 years of my life.\\
369 - My only complaint was that she couldn't cook.\\
370 - The woman could screw up iced tea.\\
371 - I mean, you know the recipe for iced tea?\\
372 - It's ice...tea. Done!\\
373 - Well, I guess you have to take the good with the bad.\\
374 - You're smarter than you look.\\
375 - You got a good one, you gotta hang on to her.\\
376 - Yeah, but how do you know you've got a good one?\\
377 - Well, you don't always know.\\
378 - Sometimes you just gotta take the leap.\\
379 - Ah, here we go. Thank you.\\
380 - Thank you very much.\\
381 - Uh-h-h..\\
382 - These are for my cat.\\
383 - I don't have a cat.\\
384 - Well, it was great talking to you, Archie.\\
385 - Alan.\\
386 - Sid.\\
387 - Here's my card.\\
388 - Oh. Thanks.\\
389 - I'll call you if I need a wing-man.\\
390 - Get it? Uh, a wing-man.\\
391 - The, the chicken?\\
392 - Leave the jokes to me, chuckles.\\
393 - Aw, jeez. I forgot my wallet.\\
394 - Don't worry. I've got it.\\

68 - Yeah, she's on that cop show "Stiffs."\\
69 - "If you're not one of the suspects\\

102 - Oh, thank you.\\
103 - And you look...wow!\\
104 - [Alan clears throat]\\
105 - That-that dress fits you like a spray-on tan.\\
106 - - It's so good to see you. - Well, you, too.\\
107 - So, uh, what are you doing here?\\
108 - Meeting you for coffee.\\
109 - Duh.\\
110 - Uh, no, I-I meant what are you doing here in LA.\\

124 - Oh, puh-lease, I haven't changed at all.\\
125 - I'd like a non-fat decaf latte with just a whisper of foam.\\
126 - Um, Kandi, he doesn't work here.\\
127 - - Is that a problem? - Nope.\\
128 - So, did you ever get remarried?\\

133 - Well, as pieces go, that's a good one.\\
134 - Thanks.\\
135 - I never told you this..\\
136 - ...but you're the best lover I ever had.\\
137 - Oh, oh, jeez, uh I don't know what to say.\\
138 - Uh, but, you know, I certainly gave it 110% every time.\\
139 - Mm, wow!\\
140 - Imagine if you had given it your all.\\
141 - I'm sorry, you're in a relationship.\\
142 - We shouldn't even be talking about this stuff.\\
143 - That's right. It's just not appropriate.\\
144 - So, um so, didn't you date Derek Jeter, for a while?\\
145 - - I did. - Huh.\\
146 -     Men       \\
147 - [knock on door]\\
148 - - Hi. - Hi!\\
149 - What are you doing here?\\
150 - Well, something weird just happened\\
151 - and I-I wanted to talk to you about it.\\
152 - You okay?\\
153 - Oh, oh, yeah, everything's fine.\\
154 - It's just, uh, uh, well, come here, sit down.\\
155 - What's going on?\\
156 - Uh, well, okay, here's the deal.\\
157 - I, I just met my ex-wife for coffee and she got a little\\
158 - flirtatious with me, and it kind of freaked me out.\\
159 - Wait, Judith got flirtatious with you?\\
160 - Oh, oh, no. It wasn't Judith.\\
161 - It was the hot one?\\
162 - Okay, I don't think Judith would appreciate that but, uh..\\
163 - ...but, yes, i-it was the-the hot one.\\
164 - What do you mean she was flirtatious?\\
165 - Oh, oh, the details are unimportant.\\
166 - I mean, she said I was better in bed\\
167 - than Derek Jeter but whatever, um..\\
168 - Wait a second, you want me to believe that one of the sexiest\\
169 - women in the world hit on you and you turned her down?\\
170 - Well, yes, yes, I-I did.\\
171 - I-I told Kandi that I'm in a committed relationship\\
172 - with a woman that I-I truly love\\
173 - and-and I just wanted to tell you because\\
174 - I don't want us to have any secrets.\\
175 - - Really? - Yeah.\\
176 - I don't need a young, rich, gorgeous movie star\\
177 - with flawless skin and a great body.\\
178 - I have you.\\
179 - Okay, l-let me try that again.\\
180 -     Men       \\
181 - Oh, hey, you should take tomorrow off.\\
182 - - Why? - It's your birthday.\\
183 - Nobody should have to work on their birthday.\\
184 - Who the hell told you it was my birthday?\\
185 - You did, when we put you on my company health plan.\\
186 - Damn it, I should've just lived with that hernia.\\
187 - Come on, birthdays are terrific.\\
188 - It's all your loved ones celebrating how great you are.\\
189 - It's like Christmas, except you're the savior of the world.\\
190 - Sounds good, but allmy loved ones\\
191 - are in jail, rehab or dead.\\
192 - I can't think of anything I'm less interested\\
193 - in than my birthday.\\
194 - Boy, do I have a story for you.\\
195 - I stand corrected.\\
196 - What's going on?\\
197 - So, I go meet Kandi for coffee.\\
198 - - Yeah. - It turns out she wants me.\\
199 - - No. - Yeah.\\
200 - - No! - Oh, yeah.\\
201 - - So did you? - No.\\
202 - - No? - Yes!\\
203 - Hold on, I'm lost.\\
204 - So, when I tell Lyndsey that I turned down Kandi because of her\\
205 - Lyndsey bangs my brains out.\\
206 - 'In the middle of the day.'\\
207 - She could see everything and she kept going.\\
208 - - No! - Yes!\\
209 - But let's not get caught in this loop again.\\
210 - I-I mean, all my life I've had to lie\\
211 - to women to have fantastic sex.\\
212 - Turns out, all I had to do was be honest.\\
213 - It's almost ridiculous in its simplicity.\\
214 - From now on, I'm just gonna be totally honest with women.\\
215 - Well, until they catch on to that scam.\\
216 - Exactly, then it's back to Alan Harper, astronaut.\\
217 -     Men       \\
218 - [phone ringing]\\
219 - [sniffs]\\
220 - Hello?\\
221 - Kandi?\\
222 - Wait, wh-why are you crying?\\
223 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.\\
224 - Okay, not that slow.\\
225 - How many drinks have you had?\\
226 - Alright, "schlebbin" is not a real number..\\
227 - ..but it sounds like it was a lot.\\
228 - Oh, no, no. D-don't talk like that.\\
229 - You've got plenty to live for.\\
230 - Alright, alright. D-don't do anything stupid.\\
231 - I-I'll be right over.\\
232 - This is the price I pay for being the best lover ever.\\
233 - Where you going?\\
234 - Oh, I, uh, got to take care of\\
235 - my drunk, hysterical ex-wife.\\
236 - What are you doing up?\\
237 - Checking the stock market in London.\\
238 - You're watching porn, aren't you?\\
239 - I have more than one window open, yes.\\
240 - Okay, I'll see you.\\
241 - Wait, hey, you, you want me to come with you?\\
242 - Oh, no, no. I think I can handle it.\\
243 - You think you might get laid.\\
244 - I have more than one window open, yes.\\
245 -     Men       \\
246 -     Men       \\
247 - [Kandi] 'It's open.'\\
248 - Kandi?\\
249 - Hi.\\
250 - Are-are you okay?\\
251 - I am now that you're here.\\
252 - Wait a minute, wh-what's going on?\\
253 - On the phone you were drunk and practically suicidal.\\
254 - - I was acting. - A-acting?\\
255 - Alan, you don't get a People's Choice Award for nothing.\\
256 - So this whole thing was a setup\\
257 - just to get me over here?\\
258 - I'm used to getting what I want.\\
259 - Well, uh, yeah, yeah, Kandi\\
260 - but I told you before I-I have a girlfriend. And-and-and..\\
261 - Oh, God, you smell good.\\
262 - K-kinda like a combination of pineapple and...hope.\\
263 - I have a couple of old friends here who wanna say hello!\\
264 - Hello. Hello.\\
265 - Why don't we continue this conversation in the bedroom?\\
266 - Oh, oh, Kandi, I, I-I can't.\\
267 - Um, I, I mean, I mean, I can.\\
268 - Uh, parts of me already did, but, uh, I-I have to leave.\\
269 - Alright, fine.\\
270 - You must really love her.\\
271 - That's the only explanation I can come up with.\\
272 - Jeez, the fact that you don't want to sleep with me\\
273 - makes me want you even more.\\
274 - But if you did sleep with me, you'd be like all the others\\
275 - and then I wouldn't want to sleep with you.\\
276 - So if you really don't want to sleep with me\\
277 - you should sleep with me.\\
278 - The scary part is that makes perfect sense.\\
279 - G-goodbye, Kandi.\\
280 - Don't forget me, Alan.\\
281 - As long as there's a slow, soapy shower in the world\\
282 - you will never be forgotten.\\
283 -     Men       \\
284 - Good morning.\\
285 - Oh, hey, how'd it go with Kandi last night?\\
286 - Horrible. She wanted to have sex with me.\\
287 - Why do bad things happen to good people?\\
288 - Bottom line is, I took the high road and it sucks.\\
289 - That's why it's the road less traveled.\\
290 - Hey, let me ask you a question.\\
291 - Yes, they're spectacular.\\
292 - I knew it.\\
293 - Now, my question.\\
294 - What do you usually do for Berta's birthday?\\
295 - Oh, uh, well, my brother would stuff a card full of cash\\
296 - and then, after he passed out, I'd steam it open\\
297 - take a few 20s and sign it.\\
298 - Yeah, I kind of get a feeling that..\\
299 - ...she doesn't have anybody doing anything special for her.\\
300 - Yeah, I don't think she does.\\
301 - Let me know if you want to give her cash, I'll buy the card.\\
302 - [phone rings]\\
303 - Oh. Hey, Lyndsey.\\
304 - Whoa, whoa, c-c-calm down.\\
305 - Kandi's hotel room?\\
306 - What, what makes you think I was there?\\
307 - Paparazzi photos on the Internet?\\
308 - Uh, wow, that, that is just, that is crazy, Lyndsey.\\
309 - I-I, I don't know what you're talking about.\\
310 - - Hmm, maybe it's this. - 'Oh, crap.'\\
311 - Um, uh, well, alright, alright, alright. I-I-I can explain that.\\
312 - Uh, uh, she-she called me at 2:00 in the morning\\
313 - and I-I thought she was drunk and suicidal\\
314 - but it turns out she was just acting.\\
315 - Did you know she won a People's Choice?\\
316 - B-b-but I swear nothing happened.\\
317 - [laughing] This doesn't look like nothing.\\
318 - Uh, okay, okay, but-but, but what you can't see in that\\
319 - picture is-is what I was thinking, and what I was\\
320 - thinking about was you, the woman I lo..\\
321 - Hello?\\
322 - Oh, man!\\
323 - Mm-mm, I'm sorry, buddy.\\
324 - Oh, look, you've been identified\\
325 - as "Matthew Broderick's father."\\
326 -     Men       \\
327 - [knock on door]\\
328 - There's the birthday girl!\\
329 - I'm not in the mood, Walden.\\
330 - There is a ton of weed in this.\\
331 - Happy birthday to me!\\
332 -     Men       \\
333 - [sighs] These photos are all over the internet.\\
334 - Oh, my God.\\
335 - Oh, my boobs look good in this one.\\
336 - Yeah, your boobs look good, your life is perfect\\
337 - and I'm going to die alone.\\
338 - Oh, Alan, I'm so sorry. What can I do to help?\\
339 - Talk to Lyndsey, tell her nothing happened.\\
340 - She won't listen to me.\\
341 - - Of course. - Thank you.\\
342 - [Kandi clears throat]\\
343 - It's her voice mail.\\
344 - She sounds very pretty.\\
345 - Just leave a message.\\
346 - Oh, hi, Lyndsey.\\
347 - It's Kandi, Alan's ex-wife and TV's Jane Risotto.\\
348 - I'm here with Alan in my hotel room and--\\
349 - - No. - What?\\
350 - - Got it. - Okay.\\
351 - Sorry, wrong number.\\

358 - How cool is that? A talking taco.\\
359 - Talking taco, talking taco, talking taco.\\
360 - Oh, jeez, I am really high.\\
361 - There must have been a cat tranquilizer in that cupcake.\\
362 - Woof.\\
363 - [both laughing]\\
364 - I got to tell you, Walden.\\
365 - I never thought that I could work for anybody but Charlie..\\
366 - ...but...you're a good guy.\\
367 - That means a lot.\\
368 - And if truth be told, I don't even mind\\
369 - seeing Zippy every day.\\
370 - Whoa!\\
371 - I must be higher than I thought.\\
372 - [Berta laughing]\\
373 - You know, when I met you, I was at a real low point..\\
374 - ...you and Alan took care of me\\
375 - I got to say, other than my mother..\\
376 - ...you're the closest thing I have to a family.\\
377 - I love you, Berta.\\
378 - You're a sentimental little taco, aren't you?\\
379 - [both laughing]\\
380 -     Men       \\
381 - [knock on door]\\
382 - - Hi, we need to talk. - Go ahead.\\
383 - I know you're really upset but I promise\\
384 - nothing happened between me and Alan.\\
385 - - I saw the pictures. - Pictures lie.\\
386 - - So do boyfriends. - But not Alan.\\
387 - Did you really try to seduce him?\\
388 - I did but he turned me down.\\
389 - - Wow. - I was as surprised as you are.\\
390 - What about all that stuff about..\\
391 - ...you enjoying sex with Alan more than with Derek Jeter?\\
392 - Oh, honey, you know better than that.\\
393 -     Men       \\
394 - Hola,Berta.\\
395 - Felizbirthday-o.\\
396 - Stop, you're freaking me out.\\

400 - What about your car?\\
401 - Oh, you know, just drive it to my house tomorrow.\\
402 - I don't know how to drive that thing.\\
403 - Oh, come on, it's easy, I'll show you.\\

422 -     Men       \\
423 - Oh, that is great, honey.\\
424 - Well, I-I will talk to you later.\\
425 - Okay, okay, bye-bye.\\
426 - Wow, Lyndsey's in a better mood.\\
427 - [Alan snorts]\\
428 - It's like her head is in a whole different place.\\
429 - Uh, uh, it's on.\\
430 - [man on TV] 'If you're not one of the suspects..'\\
431 - [together] You're one of the Stiffs.\\
432 - God, she's hot.\\
433 - - Yeah. - Yeah.\\
434 - Excuse me, I'm gonna go check the stock market.\\
435 - Guess what Walden bought me for my birthday.\\
436 -     Men       \\
437 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\
438 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\

\subsection {Episode 10: One Nut Johnson}
1 -     Men       \\
2 - Oh, incoming, 3 o'clock.\\
3 - Wow.\\
4 - If I were available, I'd be all over that.\\
5 - So being unavailable is the only thing that's stopping you?\\
6 - Well, that and her obvious, but unvoiced contempt for me.\\
7 - - Why don't you make a move? - Aw, what's the point?\\
8 - Let's say I start talking to her, and we hit it off.\\
9 - And by "hit it off," you mean\\
10 - hit it off.\\
11 - More unvoiced contempt. Hmm.\\
12 - I can voice it if you'd like.\\
13 - No thanks.\\
14 - What do you think is gonna happen as soon as she finds out\\
15 - how much money I have in the bank?\\
16 - She's gonna want you to make a deposit.\\
17 - And there's the problem.\\
18 - I-I see no problem.\\
19 - Okay. It's not me that she'd be interested in.\\
20 - It's what I can do for her. It's the lifestyle.\\
21 - So what? You still got laid.\\
22 - [chuckles] Trust me, it gets old.\\
23 - It's like having a magic golf club\\
24 - every time you take a shot, the ball just goes in the hole.\\
25 - Oh, yeah! Ker-plunk!\\
26 - Okay, apparently, you need a demonstration.\\
27 - And no more alcohol.\\
28 - Hi.\\
29 - I'm Walden Schmidt.\\
30 - Hello.\\
31 - That's Schmidt, S-C-H-M-I-D-T.\\
32 - Uh, okay. It's nice to meet you, Walden.\\
33 - I'm Susan. S-U-S-A-N.\\
34 - Can I buy you a drink, Susan?\\
35 - No, thanks. I'm waiting for some friends.\\
36 - - No problem. - Excuse me.\\
37 - Hmm. There goes your theory. You struck out!\\
38 - Au contraire, mon frere.\\
39 - Right now, she's heading into the bathroom.\\
40 - What do you think she's doing in there?\\
41 - Uh, I'm guessing tinkle. Girls poop at home.\\
42 - No. She's wondering, "Why did he spell his last name?\\
43 - Maybe I should know who he is."\\
44 - So, now, she's taking out her phone and Googling me.\\
45 - Oh, I tried that once, and I dropped my phone in the toilet.\\
46 - Fortunately, it was right after a courtesy flush.\\
47 - The first hit on my name is the "Forbes" 500 website\\
48 - at which point in time she finds out\\
49 - exactly how much money I make\\
50 - she forgets to go to the bathroom\\
51 - along with everything she learned in Sunday school\\
52 - slaps on some lipstick and comes back into the bar.\\
53 - Wow.\\
54 - She probably unbuttons one button on her blouse..\\
55 - ..and..\\
56 - You know what?\\
57 - I changed my mind about that drink.\\
58 - I still don't see the problem.\\
59 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\
60 -     Huh-huh    \\
61 -     Men       \\
62 -     Men       \\
63 - Can't believe you're coming home with me instead of that girl.\\
64 - Not that I'm not flattered.\\
65 - And not that I'm not willing to do things.\\
66 - Just because a woman wants to have sex with me\\
67 - doesn't mean I want to have sex with her.\\
68 - Okay, I hear the words coming out of your mouth\\
69 - I just don't understand them.\\
70 - It's-it's like watching HBO in Spanish.\\
71 - Well, look, call me crazy, but I am determined to find\\
72 - someone who wants to be with me for who I am, not what I have.\\
73 - Hola, bienvenidos a HBO en Espanol.\\
74 - Come on. I-I bet you have no doubt\\
75 - as to whether or not Lyndsey loves you.\\
76 - - I would guess that's true. - You don't have to guess.\\
77 - You have no money, no house, no future, no--\\
78 - Okay, okay! Talking past the sale.\\
79 - But if you think my life is so great, be my guest.\\
80 - - Take it. - What?\\
81 - Pretend to be me. I can't tell you how many times\\
82 - I've pretended to be you.\\
83 - And-and not just you. Uh, I've also pretended to be\\
84 - a, uh, a thoracic surgeon\\
85 - uh, a movie producer, a stockbroker\\
86 - uh, and on one occasion, a hand model.\\
87 - - A hand model? - Blind girl.\\
88 - Long story, didn't end well.\\
89 - My point is, you can be whoever you want to be.\\
90 - [scoffs] Never thought about it like that.\\
91 - Of course not.\\
92 - Why would Superman want to be Clark Kent?\\
93 - Okay. Know what? I'm gonna do this.\\
94 - First thing I need to do is create an online presence\\
95 - for my fictional self.\\
96 - Mm. That's good. I usually just throw ketchup\\
97 - on some scrubs and say I came from surgery.\\
98 - Okay. Let's start by creating a Facebook page.\\
99 - Uh, alright, if I was a struggling, broke-ass guy\\
100 - what would my name be?\\
101 - Oh, and keep in mind, Alan Harper's already taken.\\
102 - Ooh! Uh, h-how about Derek Slade?\\
103 - Uh, that's a little gay.\\
104 - Um...Preston Burbank?\\
105 - That's just gay from a different decade.\\
106 - Um...Joey Proccosini.\\
107 - Sounds like the guy that made Preston Burbank\\
108 - his prison bitch.\\
109 - Oh, uh-uh, how about, uh, how about your porn name?\\
110 - My porn name?\\
111 - You know, when you want to know\\
112 - what your name would be as a porn star\\
113 - you use the name of your first pet\\
114 - and the street you grew up on.\\
115 - Unfortunately, I would be Rusty Knob.\\
116 - Mine would be Snowball Honeysuckle.\\
117 - That would be a great porn name\\
118 - if Disney Channel started making adult movies.\\
119 - No. It needs to be simple, like something easy to believe.\\
120 - - John Doe. - No, it's too simple.\\
121 - - Bob Doe. - No.\\
122 - It's got to be, like, right down the middle.\\
123 - - You know, like...Sam. - Doe.\\
124 - Wilson. Sam Wilson.\\
125 - Really? There's got to be, like, a million Sam Wilsons.\\
126 - No, exactly.I-I can get lost in a crowd.\\
127 - You know, if somebody Googles me\\
128 - they'll get a butt load of responses.\\
129 - Same thing happens if you Google "Rusty Knob."\\
130 - Just FYI, do not hit "Images."\\
131 - You won't sleep for a week.\\
132 - Okay, Sam Wilson, let's create your life.\\
133 - Male.\\
134 - Straight.\\
135 - Single.\\
136 - One eighth Apache Indian.\\
137 - Mix it up a little.\\
138 -     Men       \\
139 - How have I never heard of this place?\\
140 - I mean, where else can you buy pants, shoes, lettuce\\
141 - and a garden weasel under one roof?\\
142 - It gets better. On your way out, you can get a flu shot\\
143 - and a set of tires at the same price.\\
144 - This is.. Alright\\
145 - what would a down-on-his-luck Sam Wilson wear?\\
146 - Oh! Maybe something fringed to reflect his Indian heritage.\\
147 - He's not joining the village people.\\
148 - Wait, check this out!\\
149 - A dozen socks for $2.49.\\
150 - That's 20 cents a pair. That's ten cents a sock!\\
151 - - I'm so getting these. - But you-you don't wear socks.\\
152 - Well, at these prices I can't afford not to.\\
153 - Alright, looks like you're getting the hang of this place.\\
154 - So, if you'll excuse me\\
155 - I have a dentist appointment on aisle three.\\
156 - Oh! Don't forget to floss on aisle two.\\
157 - A leather jacket for $49.99?\\
158 - Come to papa.\\
159 - Whoa! Sorry.\\
160 - Yeah, hang on. Let me just..\\
161 - The jacket's on a leash.\\
162 - I'll just unlock the security cable here.\\
163 - Okay, that's better.\\
164 - That looks really good on you.\\
165 - I bet you've said that before.\\
166 - About 80 times a day, but...this is the first time I've meant it.\\
167 - Yeah, it's nice, but I..\\
168 - I probably shouldn't. I mean, for the price of this jacket\\
169 - I can buy 240 pairs of socks.\\
170 - And your Christmas shopping is done.\\
171 - Act surprised when you open them.\\
172 - Yeah, I, actually, I need to buy a little bit of everything.\\
173 - Okay, I can help you out with that.\\
174 - I appreciate it...Kate.\\
175 - Not a problem..\\
176 - Sam...Sam Wilson.\\
177 - Alright, Sam Wilson.\\
178 - Um, how about we start with some..\\
179 - ...corduroy pants?\\
180 - Eh, I'm not a big fan of corduroy.\\
181 - They're on sale, two for $19.99.\\
182 - People change.\\
183 -     Men       \\
184 - [Jake] 'Anyway, after it got ripped off on the barbed wire'\\
185 - we started calling him "One Nut Johnson."\\
186 - Uh...that's terrible.\\
187 - Well, it could have been worse.\\
188 - An inch to the right and he would have been\\
189 - "No Johnson Johnson."\\
190 - Um, uh, you know what? Why-why don't we change the subject?\\
191 - So, um, how-how are things with your girlfriend?\\
192 - Pretty good. We're finally gonna\\
193 - get some time alone this weekend.\\
194 - Her kids are gonna stay with their dads.\\
195 - "Dads"? Plural?\\
196 - Yeah, well, before me, she picked some real losers.\\
197 - Sure, sure. Um, so..\\
198 - ...so what's it like, dating someone with kids?\\
199 - It's tough. They're pretty protective.\\
200 - I mean, I'm the guy dating their mom.\\
201 - Makes sense.\\
202 - But her oldest son's pretty cool. He buys me beer.\\
203 - how-how old is this woman?\\
204 - Back off, dad. She's taken.\\
205 - No, no, I wasn't.. I'm..\\
206 - You know what? I'll-I'll talk to you later.\\
207 - - Okay. Bye, dad. - Bye.\\
208 - Yeah...she picked a real winner this time.\\
209 - [Walden] 'Check it out.'\\
210 - Whoa! You look like me when I Photoshop my head on your body.\\
211 - I've never done that.\\
212 - Head to toe, including undergarments, $32.\\
213 - [whistling]\\
214 - Plus the haircut, $232.\\
215 - - Nice. - Oh!\\
216 - Check this out.\\
217 - [velcro rips]\\
218 - - Velcro. Very classy. - It's got a change pouch.\\
219 - Ooh, you got the deluxe model.\\
220 - I still can't believe we both went to the superstore\\
221 - you got a hot date and I got a root canal on the wrong tooth.\\
222 - I didn't get a date. Sam Wilson got a date.\\
223 - You know what?\\
224 - - Switch watches with me. - Why?\\
225 - 'Cause Sam Wilson doesn't have a $50,000 watch.\\
226 - Ah, of course. Here you go.\\
227 - Casio?\\
228 - I had this watch in seventh grade!\\
229 - So did I.\\
230 - Okay. Oh, you know what? We should also switch cars.\\
231 - Yes! Yes. Oh, and you know what else we should do?\\
232 - Uh, you should deposit all your money in my bank account.\\
233 - Just trying to help you out, buddy.\\
234 - - Thank you. - Oh, where you taking her?\\
235 - This, uh, Italian place in Santa Monica. DiFilipo's.\\
236 - Oh, you are in luck. I have a coupon.\\
237 - [velcro rips]\\
238 - Buy one entree, get one free.\\
239 - Sweet. Thanks.\\
240 - And remember, uh, poor guys don't valet park\\
241 - unless they're wearing a red vest.\\
242 - Got it.\\
243 - Wow. $50,000.\\
244 - What is wrong with me that I want to masturbate with this on?\\
245 - Nothing.\\
246 -     Men       \\
247 - For a man on a budget, this is a little pricey.\\
248 - Oh, don't worry. I have a coupon.\\
249 - [velcro rips]\\
250 - Sexy.\\
251 - So, Sam, tell me about yourself.\\
252 - There's not much to tell.\\
253 - Uh, I was born in Iowa.\\
254 - At age seven, I was taken away from my parents\\
255 - and trained to be a government assassin.\\
256 - - Intriguing. - Oh, it gets better.\\
257 - It wasn't our government.\\
258 - And I only found out later, they weren't my parents.\\
259 - [laughs]\\
260 - Which made killing them that much easier.\\
261 - Tell me about you.\\
262 - Well, I had a fairly typical childhood\\
263 - in Riverside, California\\
264 - until my parents were killed by an assassin.\\
265 - I've spent the rest of my life tracking him down\\
266 - and here we are.\\
267 - - Gulp. - Bang.\\
268 - [laughs]\\
269 - Well, the Riverside part's true\\
270 - and then I spent two years in New York studying fashion.\\
271 - Then I came out here to design clothes for the movies.\\
272 - And how did that go?\\
273 - I designed this dress and wore it to the movies.\\
274 - - So the dream is still alive. - Indeed it is.\\
275 - I got to tell you, it's refreshing\\
276 - talking to someone like you for a change.\\
277 - Someone like me?\\
278 - Yeah, someone who doesn't take himself too seriously\\
279 - and who's not constantly trying to impress me\\
280 - with how much stuff he's got.\\
281 - What, so, wait, my coupon didn't impress you?\\
282 - [laughs]\\
283 - Well, I don't have much stuff.\\
284 - What you see is what you get.\\
285 - And so far I like what I see.\\
286 - I like what I see.\\
287 - Such a shame I'm gonna have to kill you.\\
288 - Too late. I already poisoned your wine.\\
289 - [laughs]\\
290 -     Men       \\
291 -     Men       \\
292 - - Okay, you see the Big Dipper? - Yeah.\\
293 - Alright, you see the last star on the handle?\\
294 - Follow that five stars to the right.\\
295 - - Okay. - Up three.\\
296 - - Got it. - Two to the left and down one.\\
297 - - Uh-huh. - That's my star.\\
298 - I got it for Christmas when I was 12 years old.\\
299 - - That's sweet. - Yeah, sure, now.\\
300 - When I was 12, I wanted a dirt bike.\\
301 - Can't pop a wheelie on a star.\\
302 - [laughs]\\
303 - I'm kind of glad your car broke down.\\
304 - Me, too.\\
305 - You want to make a wish on my star?\\
306 - I already did.\\
307 - [car horn blaring]\\
308 - For crying out loud, Sam\\
309 - when you going to buy a decent car?\\
310 -     Men       \\
311 - Kate, this is my friend Alan.\\
312 - Thanks so much for picking us up.\\
313 - Yeah, this clown rents a room from me\\
314 - suddenly I'm running a taxi service.\\
315 - Yeah, I'm sorry. My car is a piece of crap.\\
316 - Of course, I don't do myself any favors\\
317 - by never changing the oil, ever.\\
318 - Well, I like your car.\\
319 - - Thank you. - Thank you.\\
320 - Uh, so Sam tells me you have a beach house.\\
321 - I do. I do. It's gorgeous.\\
322 - Uh, it very expensive\\
323 - but I bought it at the bottom of the market\\
324 - and then I sold it and bought it again at the top of the market\\
325 - simply because I can.\\
326 - Well, I'm sure at some point you'll sell it again\\
327 - and we'll go our separate ways.\\
328 - Oh, no, no, no, I'm gonna die in that house.\\
329 - Oh, and, uh, that reminds me, uh, your rent is late again.\\
330 - Right, I'll have it for you tomorrow.\\
331 - - Today would be better. - Fine, today.\\
332 - He's a good kid.\\
333 - Give you the shirt off his back.\\
334 - It's a crappy shirt, but he'll give it to you.\\
335 - Oh, oh, would you look at the time?\\
336 - It is almost 10 o'clock.\\
337 - I-I can tell 'cause the, uh\\
338 - the big hand is near the big diamond.\\
339 - - Check it out. - Yeah, it's nice.\\
340 - Damn right.\\
341 - So, Kate, Sam tells me you're poor like him.\\
342 -     Men       \\
343 - I had a really nice time tonight.\\
344 - Me, too, but what's with this guy Alan?\\
345 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
346 - He recently came into a lot of money\\
347 - and he's not really handling it well.\\
348 - Not handling it well? He's a big, fizzy douche.\\
349 - I mean, the way he was showing off his car.\\
350 - Geez, how small is his penis?\\
351 - Those two things aren't always related.\\
352 - Okay, I-I don't know, that watch\\
353 - is definitely overcompensating for something.\\
354 - Some people just like nice stuff\\
355 - even people with really big penises.\\
356 - Well, everyone likes nice stuff\\
357 - but he didn't have to be such a jackass about it.\\
358 - I know, but, I mean, he's helping me out\\
359 - letting me live with him.\\
360 - I get it. It still doesn't give him the right to treat you\\
361 - the way he does.\\
362 - - You should say something. - Oh, I intend to.\\
363 - You know, before he arrived, I was about to do something.\\
364 - So was I.\\
365 - [horn blaring]\\
366 - [Alan] 'Come on, Sam!'\\
367 - 'Time is money, and you're out of both.'\\
368 - You're right. He's a big, fizzy douche.\\
369 -     Men       \\
370 - Hey, looking good.\\
371 - Where you going?\\
372 - Oh, I'm packing a picnic for me and Kate.\\
373 - We're going to a free concert in the park.\\
374 - It's a Van Halen tribute band.\\
375 - Well, actually, it's not a band.\\
376 - It's just a guy named Dan Halen.\\
377 - Unbelievable. You're having fun living my life.\\
378 - I've never had that experience.\\
379 - Well, it's all because of Kate.\\
380 - And the best part is, she likes me for me.\\
381 - Uh, technically, she likes you for me.\\
382 - Which is ironic 'cause she doesn't like you at all.\\
383 - - So, uh, what's the plan here? - What do you mean?\\
384 - Well, I mean, this girl's been dating\\
385 - Sam Wilson for a couple of weeks.\\
386 - When are you going to introduce her to Walden Schmidt?\\
387 - I don't know. Haven't really thought that far ahead.\\
388 - Actually, I'm kind of afraid to think that far ahead.\\
389 - How long do you think you can keep up this\\
390 - "Prince and the Pauper" charade?\\
391 - How long do you think you can keep living here for free?\\
392 - Godspeed, Sam Wilson.\\
393 -     Men       \\
394 - [both exhales]\\
395 - Well, that was fun on a budget.\\
396 - Yeah, we certainly got more bang for our buck, didn't we?\\
397 - [mobile beeps]\\
398 - - Oh. I'm sorry. I just.. - Oh.\\
399 - - Ah, great. - Everything okay?\\
400 - Yeah. Alan wants me to pick up some hemorrhoid cream\\
401 - on the way home.\\
402 - Well, he is a pain in the ass.\\
403 - He's not that bad.\\
404 - Oh, yeah? Then why don't we ever spend the night\\
405 - at his Malibu beach house?\\
406 - He doesn't like it when I have guests.\\
407 - Douche.\\
408 - You should move out.\\
409 - Can't afford to.\\
410 - Well, um, maybe you could crash here.\\
411 - What...what are you saying, like...move in?\\
412 - Yeah, just until you have enough money to afford your own place.\\
413 - That might be a while.\\
414 - I knew I shouldn't have bought that Dan Halen T-shirt.\\
415 - [laughs]\\
416 - So, what, we'd be, like, roommates?\\
417 - With benefits.\\
418 - Oh. I like the sound of benefits.\\
419 - Good, 'cause they include washing the dishes\\
420 - and taking out the trash.\\
421 - Okay, clearly we differ in our definition of "benefits."\\
422 - [laughs]\\
423 - - Can I think about it? - By all means.\\
424 - Okay, I got to tell you, you are much better kisser than Alan.\\
425 -     Men       \\
426 - - Are you sure about this? - Mm.\\
427 - It's like Dan Halen says, "Might as well jump."\\
428 - Well, when are you coming back?\\
429 - I don't know.\\
430 - Walden, have you really thought this through?\\
431 - I know it's crazy, but I got to see where this goes with Kate.\\
432 - Alright, I'm just concerned about my friend.\\
433 - I appreciate that. I'm gonna be fine.\\
434 - Mm. Good luck.\\
435 - And, uh, don't worry about anything here.\\
436 - - Yeah. Thanks, buddy. - Well, bye.\\
437 - Bye.\\
438 - Finally, you're mine! You're all mine!\\
439 -     Men       \\
440 -     Men       \\
441 - So my porn name would be Snowball Honeysuckle.\\
442 - [chuckles] Oh, that is so cute.\\
443 - I would download every one of your films.\\
444 - - What would yours be? - Beebo Eighty-Ninth Street.\\
445 - Guess it's not a foolproof system.\\
446 - Hey, I have to ask you a question.\\
447 - He was a fish.\\
448 - Thanks, but no. Um...why are you with me?\\
449 - What kind of a question is that?\\
450 - I don't know. Just, I don't have much to offer\\
451 - and a beautiful, smart girl like you\\
452 - could probably get any guy she wants.\\
453 - But I did get the guy I want.\\
454 - Good answer.\\
455 - - Just promise me one thing. - What's that?\\
456 - That we're always honest with each other.\\
457 - No secrets, no lies.\\
458 - You got it.\\

\subsection {Episode 11: Give Santa a Tail-Hole}
1 - I am determined to find someone who wants to be with me\\
2 - for who I am not what I have.\\
3 - I need to buy a little bit of everything.\\
4 - I can help you out with that.\\
5 - I appreciate it...Kate.\\
6 - Not a problem..\\
7 - Sam Wilson.\\
8 - It's refreshing\\
9 - talking to someone like you for a change.\\
10 - - Someone like me? - Yeah\\
11 - Someone who's not constantly trying to impress me\\
12 - with how much stuff he's got.\\
13 - Kate, this is my friend Alan.\\
14 - Thanks so much for pickin' us up.\\
15 - Yeah, this clown rents a room from me\\
16 - suddenly I'm running a taxi service.\\
17 - You should move out.\\
18 - Can't afford to.\\
19 - Maybe you could crash here.\\
20 - Have you really thought this through?\\
21 - I've gotta see where this goes with Kate.\\
22 - - Promise me one thing. - What's that?\\
23 - That we're always honest with each other.\\
24 - You got it.\\
25 -     Men       \\
26 - Anyways, I hope that it's okay\\
27 - that I have people over on Christmas.\\
28 - It's just Jake and Lyndsey and my mom.\\
29 - Of course. It's the holidays.\\
30 - It's the time to be with the ones you love.\\
31 - Right. Uh, and my mom.\\
32 - So, uh, so listen, Sam Wilson, how are things in Poorville?\\
33 - Are you "Les Miserables?"\\
34 - Actually, it's a hoot.\\
35 - You know, last night Kate and I went shopping\\
36 - at the 99 Cent Store.\\
37 - That place is amazing.\\
38 - Did you know that everything there is 99 cents?\\
39 - Know it, I registered there for my wedding.\\
40 - Two cans of peaches- 99 cents. Four-pack of yogurt- 99 cents.\\
41 - This owl-shaped mug?\\
42 - 99 cents.\\
43 - Guess how much the wine inside was?\\
44 - Uh, I'm going to go out on a limb and say 99 cents?\\
45 - 79 cents.\\
46 - Dented box.\\
47 - From now on, I'm buying everything from that place.\\
48 - Uh, not condoms.\\
49 - I think that's how I ended up with Jake.\\
50 - - Hey. - Hey, baby.\\
51 - - Uh, I gotta go. - Oh, hey, Katie.\\
52 - Alan. How are you?\\
53 - I'm fine, just, uh... sipping some wine I got\\
54 - at the 999 Dollar Store.\\
55 - Bye, Alan.\\
56 - Douche.\\
57 - Don't worry about him.\\
58 - How was your day?\\
59 - It's Christmas, Sam.\\
60 - Happy people wishing you "Peace on Earth."\\
61 - - It was horrible. - Okay.\\
62 - Somebody's got a case of the grinches.\\
63 - No, it's a case of nine-hour shifts\\
64 - listening to Celine Dion murder "O Holy Night."\\
65 - If I ever meet that skinny bitch\\
66 - I'm going to beat the "O Holy" crap out of her.\\
67 - And that's what Christmas is all about.\\
68 - I'm sorry.\\
69 - Tell me about your day.\\
70 - After you left, I made some breakfast..\\
71 - Oh, I got the mail.\\
72 - And then I did some work on that app I've been developing\\
73 - and then I did some serious research on World War II.\\
74 - Really?\\
75 - I fell asleep watching the History Channel.\\
76 - Sweetie, can I be honest with you?\\
77 - Yeah. What's up?\\
78 - I am working my ass off.\\
79 - It would be really, really nice if you could\\
80 - I don't know, pitch in a little.\\
81 - You heard the part about me getting the mail, right?\\
82 - You do understand that what came in the mail is a pile of bills?\\
83 - I mean, I think it is great that you're working\\
84 - on your computer stuff but we need help now.\\
85 - I get it. Say no more.\\
86 - I'll start looking for a job.\\
87 - Thank you.\\
88 - And don't worry, it's not like I expect you to make\\
89 - a million dollars or anything.\\
90 - Oh, thank God.\\
91 - [cell phone ringing]\\
92 - Go ahead. I'm going to go run a bath.\\
93 - I reek of comfort and joy.\\
94 - Hey, Billy. What's up?\\
95 - Nothing much, just running our company while you take\\
96 - some personal time.\\
97 - Why don't you just man up and admit you're in rehab?\\
98 - I am not in rehab. I told you.\\
99 - I'm on a spiritual journey.\\
100 - Spiritual journey. Yeah, you know what?\\
101 - I've been on four of those. I still wake up craving meth.\\
102 - I call it "Eat, Pray, Love\\
103 - "have angry sex with an Asian hooker."\\
104 - What do you want, Billy?\\
105 - [Billy] 'I'm just keeping you in the loop about what's going on.'\\
106 - We got new computers in the bullpen.\\
107 - We got a staple-less stapler.\\
108 - Mark Zuckerberg offered to buy a controlling interest\\
109 - in the company for 800 million and the redhead in marketing\\
110 - is not wearing bras.\\
111 - Wait a minute. Wait a minute.\\
112 - There's a staple-less stapler?\\
113 - I think we should take his offer.\\
114 - Billy, we built the Electric Suitcase from the ground up.\\
115 - I mean, besides, we've been here before.\\
116 - You hated the fact that I sold our last company\\
117 - and I've come to realize that you were right.\\
118 - I hated Tarnell, the gangster who sold me crack\\
119 - but I was still happy to work with him.\\
120 - I mean, look, this is a good offer.\\
121 - - We should take it. - Okay.\\
122 - Tell him 1.2 billion, but we keep control.\\
123 - Where do you think we're going to get a better offer?\\
124 - Bath's ready. Want to join me?\\
125 - I just got a better offer. Good-bye.\\

130 -     Mele kalikimaka is the thing to say    \\
131 -     On a bright Hawaiian Christmas day    \\
132 -     That's the island greeting that we send to you    \\
133 -     From a land where palm trees sway    \\
134 -     Here we know..        Here we know that Christmas    \\
135 -     Will be green and bright    \\
136 - Geez! You scared me. I nearly dropped the champagne.\\
137 - Where did you get money to buy champagne?\\
138 - You left some for me.\\
139 - - For emergencies. - Yeah.\\
140 - We were out of champagne.\\
141 - So, what are you doing here?\\
142 - What am I doing here in my house?\\
143 - Uh, uh, I'm sorry, let me rephrase that.\\
144 - Uh, uh, great to see you. What brings you by?\\
145 - I'm doing laundry for Kate and me.\\
146 - Really? You did laundry.\\
147 - - No, I did laundry. - Thank you.\\
148 - So, you're, like, some sort of kept man, huh?\\
149 - Well, I'm supposed to be out job hunting\\
150 - but it's kind of hard since Sam Wilson\\
151 - doesn't actually exist.\\
152 - I can help you there.\\
153 - Five grand will get you a clean Social Security card\\
154 - and a new set of fingerprints.\\
155 - - Six will get you the fingers. - The fingers?\\
156 - Better to have and not need than to need and not have.\\
157 - Hey, uh, why don't you just go to an ATM\\
158 - pull out a few thousand dollars and tell her you got a job?\\
159 - But that would be lying.\\
160 - Oh, no, you wouldn't want to lie to her, Sam Wilson.\\
161 - Let me explain something to you, Alan.\\
162 - Walden Schmidt lies.\\
163 - Sam Wilson tells the truth.\\
164 - Besides, I like Sam Wilson's life.\\
165 - It feels more like.. I don't know, real life.\\
166 - Yeah, I get that.\\
167 - That's why I like to sleep in your bed.\\
168 - Feels more like a...real bed.\\
169 - Oh, and get this.\\
170 - I got a call from Billy today.\\
171 - We got an offer to buy our company for $800 million.\\
172 - Excuse me a sec.\\
173 - $800 million!\\
174 - Yeah. We turned it down.\\
175 - You turned it down.\\
176 -     Men       \\
177 - Check it out.\\
178 - [Kate] 'Oh, Sam.'\\
179 - I hope you stole that.\\
180 - It wasn't that expensive.\\
181 - We barely made rent this month.\\
182 - I know, but it's Christmas.\\
183 - You don't have to tell me.\\
184 - I'm earning extra money\\
185 - by making a Santa outfit for my boss' labra-doodle.\\
186 - Aw, that's cute.\\
187 - Then I'm gonna make three wise men costumes\\
188 - for her cats.\\
189 - And just like that, cute becomes creepy.\\
190 - Okay, I'm going to go change.\\
191 - I've gotta lead on a job.\\
192 - - Really? - Yeah.\\
193 - If that doesn't work, I'm gonna rob a bank.\\
194 - I hope the 99 Cent Store sells ski masks.\\
195 - - Oh, man. - What?\\
196 - I forgot to give Santa a tail-hole.\\
197 - Worst Christmas carol ever.\\
198 -     Men       \\

202 - Yeah, that's actually why I was calling.\\
203 - I'm not gonna be able to make it home this year.\\
204 - What? Why?\\
205 - My girlfriend Tammy Sue asked me to spend Christmas\\
206 - with her and her three kids.\\
207 - I'm pretending to be Santa and also their various fathers.\\
208 - Oh, kill me.\\
209 - H-H-How did you meet this woman?\\
210 - I play softball with her parole officer.\\
211 - Oh, dig me up and kill me again.\\
212 - Alright, well, I hope I see you soon.\\
213 - Don't worry, we'll all come visit\\
214 - as soon as Tammy Sue gets her ankle bracelet off.\\
215 - That will be a magical day.\\
216 - Yeah. Alright. Merry Christmas, Dad. Bye.\\
217 - Merry Christmas, Jake.\\

235 - What are you pushing? Balsam? Noble? Doug fir?\\
236 - - Uh-- - Enh!\\

239 - ...from the Armenian.\\
240 - Are you comfortable with celebrities?\\
241 - - What do you mean? - We get a lot of big names.\\
242 - Mario Lopez buys his tree here every year.\\

253 - I like it.\\
254 - I'll go get you some gloves.\\
255 - [cell phone ringing]\\
256 - By the way, your cell phone's like your penis.\\
257 - When you're at work, you keep it in your pants.\\
258 - Hey, Billy, I'm kind of busy.\\
259 - I'm not in rehab.\\
260 - Relax, Zuckerberg is not going to walk.\\
261 - Just sit tight and we'll get the number we want.\\
262 - I got to go. Bye.\\

274 - Yeah.\\
275 - - Already sold nine trees. - Nice.\\
276 - Yeah, it's the first night, and I'm getting the stink eye\\
277 - from the other salesman, Jose.\\
278 - He only sold six, but the guy crushes it with wreathes.\\
279 - Check it out, made enough on tips to get us Chinese food.\\
280 - Aw, you really know how to take care of your lady, Rudolph.\\
281 - Oh, no, no, no, I don't get the nose until I sell 50 trees.\\
282 - Shall we open a fresh box of wine?\\
283 - No. No, no, no, no!\\
284 - Oh, switching to soda.\\
285 - My sewing machine, it just died on me.\\

288 - than I'll make on this job.\\
289 - Okay, it's not a problem. Look at the bright side.\\
290 - Somewhere in the world, there's a labra-doodle and three cats\\
291 - that get to keep their dignity.\\
292 - I wish that made me feel better.\\
293 - I got something that will make you feel better.\\
294 - - Let's dance. - What?\\

311 - Oh, yeah.\\
312 -     Men       \\
313 - Okay, drive slow. Stick to the side streets.\\
314 - - Well, you are a natural, kid. - Ah.\\

326 - - Billy, how'd you find me? - Oh, it's easy.\\
327 - You told Alan you were working here.\\
328 - You swore him to secrecy. I gave him 100 bucks.\\
329 - Bam, here I am.\\
330 - - You wanna buy a tree? - No, no.\\
331 - I want to sell our company to Mark Zuckerberg.\\
332 - He has upped his offer to $950 million.\\
333 - Wow, that's a lot of money.\\
334 - You know, I could probably get you into this eight-foot cypress\\
335 - from Oregon for 50 bucks off the sticker price.\\
336 - $950 million. We can buy Oregon.\\
337 - Look at how uptight you are.\\
338 - I mean, you should get a job here with me selling trees.\\
339 - It's stress-free, I mean everybody leaves here happy\\
340 - some people really happy with a case of the munchies.\\
341 - Walden, let me just call Zuckerberg and close the deal.\\
342 - You can close the deal at 1.2 for 49% of the company.\\
343 - - I'm not giving up control. - You're crazy, alright?\\
344 - You are bat-crap freaking crazy.\\
345 - I've never been so sane in my entire life.\\
346 - Now, if you'll excuse me\\
347 - I've got a red, blinking nose to live up to.\\
348 -     Men       \\

359 - My grandma fell down and broke her hip.\\
360 - Big deal, old people do that all the time.\\
361 - It's like a cold with them.\\
362 - Can't your grandfather take care of her?\\
363 - - He's dead. - Man, I can't catch a break.\\
364 - We can celebrate when I get back.\\
365 - Sure, nothing says Christmas like January 3rd.\\
366 - I'm sorry, Alan. I don't have a choice.\\
367 - I know. It's okay.\\
368 - - I love you. - I love you, too.\\
369 - - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.\\
370 - Sometimes she can be so selfish.\\
371 - Alright, I'm out of here.\\
372 - [sighing]\\
373 - [sighing]\\
374 - I'm gonna hate myself for asking.\\
375 - What's wrong?\\
376 - Well, all my Christmas plans have fallen apart.\\

390 - My hands are blistered. I can hardly feel my feet.\\
391 - It was awesome.\\
392 - I wish I felt that way about my job.\\
393 - Yeah, but your job's just a way to get by\\
394 - until you get your big break as a designer.\\
395 - I've been getting by for three years now.\\
396 - What if it never happens?\\
397 - I mean, for God's sakes\\
398 - I don't even have a sewing machine that works.\\
399 - You got a boyfriend that does.\\
400 - Did you sell more wreaths than Jose?\\
401 - [scoffs] No.\\
402 - That guy is a wreath-selling machine.\\
403 - He sold one to a guy without a door.\\
404 - Aw.\\
405 - Is that a mistletoe?\\
406 - It's supposed to be.\\
407 - It's actually broccoli.\\
408 - I thought it'd be romantic.\\

430 - His name is Doug?\\
431 - His name is Douglas, but his friends call him Doug.\\

439 - - Is he at 1.2? - He's at a billion.\\
440 - Alright now, Walden, think about that number.\\
441 - You know how when you say someone's one in a million?\\
442 - You could have a thousand of them\\
443 - but we have to give him an answer.\\
444 - You tell him 1.2 for 49% of the company\\
445 - and I'll throw in a wreath.\\
446 - Suck it, Jose.\\
447 - - What do you think? - I'll give you 30 bucks.\\

480 - Are you kidding me?\\
481 - This.. You made this yourself.\\
482 - This is the best gift I've ever gotten.\\
483 - Maybe later you can sew me a little tail-hole.\\

\subsection {Episode 12: Welcome to Alancrest}
1 - I'm determined to find someone who wants to be with me\\
2 - for who I am, not what I have.\\
3 - My point is, you can be whoever you wanna be.\\
4 - - I can help you out with that. - I appreciate it...Kate.\\
5 - Sam Wilson.\\
6 - Maybe you could crash here.\\
7 - - Have you thought this through? - I gotta see where this goes.\\
8 - I think it is great that you're working on your computer stuff\\
9 - but...we need help now.\\
10 - Say no more.\\
11 - I'll start looking for a job.\\
12 -     Men       \\
13 - Hey!\\
14 - Oh, look who finally decided to show up.\\
15 - Uh, yeah, I got stuck in traffic.\\
16 - Traffic, pfft.\\
17 - You were with her, weren't you?\\
18 - Really, Alan?\\
19 - I don't mean to sound like a broken record\\
20 - but you're never home anymore.\\
21 - I was just there the other night.\\
22 - And all you did was watch the game and fall asleep.\\
23 - Remember how we used to stay up all night and just talk?\\
24 - Okay, you know, fine, we can talk now.\\
25 - - What's on your mind? - Nothing. I'm fine.\\
26 - [sighs] I'm not a mind reader, Alan.\\
27 - Well, not that you care, but..\\
28 - ...I'm rattling around in that big house\\
29 - all by myself.\\
30 - I miss you. There, I said it.\\
31 - I miss you too.\\
32 - You got a funny way of showing it.\\
33 - You do understand I have a girlfriend, right?\\
34 - So do I. Another peach mojito, please.\\
35 - What are you drinking? It's on me.\\
36 - By "On me," I mean the money you left me to pay the bills\\
37 - which, incidentally, I used for other stuff\\
38 - so I'll need money to pay the bills.\\
39 - I'll have a ginger ale, please.\\
40 - Ginger ale?\\
41 - Yeah, my stomach's been bothering me.\\
42 - I haven't really been feeling myself lately.\\
43 - Which self would that be? Walden Schmidt or Sam Wilson?\\
44 - Well, Sam Wilson has a lot of stress.\\
45 - Thank you.\\
46 - Money's tight.\\
47 - You'd be surprised what that does to a guy.\\
48 - Please, I've been so desperate for money\\
49 - I've climbed into fountains at night\\
50 - and stolen the wishes of children.\\
51 - So you get it.\\
52 - What I don't get is why you don't resolve the stress\\
53 - and just tell Kate the truth?\\
54 - [scoffs] That's not gonna happen.\\
55 - - Why not? - I don't know.\\
56 - Everything's going so great, I don't wanna screw it up.\\
57 - Oh, that's not good.\\
58 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\
59 -     Ha-ah ah    \\
60 -     Men       \\
61 -     Men       \\
62 - I don't know whether this is beef or chicken\\
63 - but it's definitely worth 79 cents.\\
64 - What's the matter?\\
65 - My life has been a complete waste of time.\\
66 - Otherwise, I'm terrific.\\
67 - Whoa, whoa, wait. Is this..\\
68 - Is this one of the dresses you made?\\
69 - - Mm-hmm. - Why're you throwing it away?\\
70 - Because, apparently... my stuff's not good enough\\
71 - to get a job that pays nothing.\\
72 - - You didn't get the internship? - No.\\
73 - Rejected by the guy who assists the guy who assists the guy\\
74 - who designs Snooki's\\
75 - signature line of baby thongs!\\
76 - Okay, don't worry, you're gonna get the next one.\\
77 - There is no next one.\\
78 - I mean, obviously\\
79 - I don't have what it takes to be a fashion designer.\\
80 - I just have to bite the bullet\\
81 - and admit it is not happening.\\
82 - But you're not at that point.\\
83 - Three words!\\
84 - Snooki's..\\
85 - ...baby..\\
86 - ...thongs!\\
87 - I think your designs are great.\\
88 - You have to say that, I have sex with you.\\
89 - True. But if I was a woman\\
90 - I would totally wear this dress.\\
91 - Hell, three shots of tequila and I would wear this dress.\\
92 - And I would work it!\\
93 - Okay, don't make me laugh when I'm trying to cry.\\
94 - Too late, because I am fierce.\\
95 - [laughing] I love you, Sam.\\
96 - You have to say that.\\
97 - I have sex with you.\\
98 - Okay...the real test\\
99 - is will you have sex with me wearing that dress?\\
100 - You get the tequila, I'll go put on some heels.\\
101 -     Men       \\
102 - Lightly salted, just the way you like.\\
103 - [chuckles] Mm, thanks.\\
104 - - Who could've seen this coming? - Right.\\
105 - We end up with the house.\\
106 - [chuckles] Unbelievable.\\
107 - You know how I used to say\\
108 - you'd have to pay me to hang with you?\\
109 - - Yeah. - Here we are.\\
110 - - Hey, guys! - Mm.\\
111 - - Mm! - Oh, look who it is.\\
112 - - Sam Wilson. - Hey, Alan!\\
113 - Can I talk to you for a second?\\
114 - Oh, sure.\\
115 - - The principal wants to see me. - Mm.\\
116 - Oh, uh, Berta, I brought some laundry by.\\
117 - Uh, do you mind?\\
118 - It's your machine. Knock yourself out.\\
119 - So, what's up?\\
120 - I'm transferring $100,000 into your bank account.\\
121 - [gasps] A hundred thousand..\\
122 - Catch me, Lord.\\
123 - I-I think I need to sit down.\\
124 - - Yeah, yeah. - I..\\
125 - I-I could swear that I heard you say\\
126 - you were gonna put $100,000 into my account.\\
127 - - I am. - There it goes again.\\
128 - It's-it's like the teacups at Disneyland.\\
129 - How can I ever thank you?\\
130 - The money is for Kate.\\
131 - Next time, lead with that.\\
132 - I want to invest in her fashion designs.\\
133 - - What? - She'sreally talented.\\
134 - But nobody will give her a shot.\\
135 - Are you sure she's talented?\\
136 - It isn't just boom-shaka-laka-laka\\
137 - boom-shaka-laka-laka?\\
138 - I'm about to give you a boom-shaka-laka!\\
139 - No, $100,000 will help her start her company.\\
140 - - Give it to her. - I can't.\\
141 - I'm Sam Wilson. I'm broke.\\
142 - But you can, because you're Alan Harper, billionaire.\\
143 - Oh..\\
144 - Fashion's kind of risky.\\
145 - And Alan Harper did not become a billionaire\\
146 - by taking unnecessary risks.\\
147 - You are taking an unnecessary risk right now!\\
148 - No, I-I'm just saying that I'd rather put my money into gold\\
149 - or maybe start a vineyard. "Alancrest."\\
150 - Fine, when you make $100,000..\\
151 - I don't even have to finish that.\\
152 - I-I want my money invested in Kate.\\
153 - Okay, no problem.\\
154 - But I'll have to see some of her sketches first.\\
155 - - Alan. - What?\\
156 - You want this to be believable, don't you?\\
157 - Fine. Have us over tomorrow night.\\
158 - - Ooh, kind of short notice! - Alan!\\
159 - Can't we do this at your house?\\
160 - This is my house!\\
161 - Awfully rude for a guy who wants my money.\\
162 -     Men       \\
163 - It's like you've never washed a dish in your life.\\
164 - What are you talking about?\\
165 - There's still SpaghettiOs on this plate.\\
166 - You're the one that wanted to be all fancy\\
167 - and said we couldn't eat them straight out of the can.\\
168 - Ugh.\\
169 - Oh, speaking of fancy.\\
170 - - I saw Alan today. - Ew.\\
171 - It was actually a really interesting conversation.\\
172 - He's looking for some new investments.\\
173 - He should go and buy himself a better personality.\\
174 - Nobody's that rich.\\
175 - Uh, but I did tell him that you're trying to start\\
176 - your own fashion company.\\
177 - - Oh, Sam, you didn't. - Oh, but I did.\\
178 - He can help you.\\
179 - I don't want his help.\\
180 - Unless I'm gonna start a line called "House of Douche."\\
181 - Don't be ridiculous.\\
182 - I'm sure that name's already taken.\\
183 - Hey, he could be the answer to all your problems.\\
184 - Oh, I don't know.\\
185 - Before you say no..\\
186 - ...he invited us over tomorrow night\\
187 - so you can show him your designs.\\
188 - You really think he'd invest in me?\\
189 - - He'd be an idiot not to. - But he is an idiot.\\
190 - True.\\
191 - - Give it a chance? - Alright.\\
192 - - I'll do it. - Great.\\
193 - Oh, did I mention that if you take his money\\
194 - you have to sleep with him?\\
195 - [gagging]\\
196 - I'm kidding. I'll totally do him.\\
197 - [gagging]\\
198 -     Men       \\
199 - [doorbell ringing]\\
200 - Ah! Sam, Kate.\\
201 - Welcome to "Alancrest."\\
202 - W-Why are you wearing pajamas?\\
203 - I'm rich. I can.\\
204 - You have a beautiful home.\\
205 - It'll work until my castle's finished.\\
206 - Entrez-vous.\\
207 - Uh, that's French for "Enter, you."\\
208 - Oh, look, my panoramic ocean view.\\
209 - You can follow my seagulls on Twitter.\\
210 - Hashtag, "Gulls gone wild."\\
211 - Oh, ah, delightful!\\
212 - Thank you, Berta. That will be all.\\
213 - Damn right it will!\\
214 - [laughing] She's been with the family for years.\\
215 - They say you're not really rich\\
216 - until you have servants who hate you.\\
217 - Uh, Alan, Kate brought her portfolio to show you--\\
218 - Oh, yes! Kate, please take a seat.\\
219 - - Take my breath away! - Oh, I'd love to.\\
220 - I made some new sketches just for you.\\
221 - Yeah, she's been working really hard on them.\\
222 - I think you're really gonna like what you see.\\
223 - [laughing] No offense, Sam, but look at the way you dress.\\
224 - Alright.\\
225 - Oh, it's-it's nice.\\
226 - No, I-I like what you did here.\\
227 - Thank you.\\
228 - Uh, cap sleeves are-are last season\\
229 - but-but you know, okay.\\
230 - Oh, I'm kind of done with rompers\\
231 - but I understand what you're going for.\\
232 - Oh, oh, velvet.\\
233 - Kind of whore-ish.\\
234 - - Excuse me? - Okay.\\
235 - You know what, Kate, why don't you run out to the car\\
236 - and grab some of your samples.\\
237 - I think Alan would love to see them.\\
238 - Yeah, sure.\\
239 - Just hope they're not too whore-ish.\\
240 - Yeah, let's leave that to Lady Gaga.\\
241 - Ow!\\
242 - What the hell is the matter with you?\\
243 - Me? She's the one who paired an empire waist\\
244 - with a Peter Pan collar!\\
245 - You're supposed to be a simple rich guy\\
246 - not a gay Bruce Wayne.\\
247 - Hey, you have your character, I have mine.\\
248 - Well, your character is a festering heap of human waste!\\
249 - I think we both know if I had money\\
250 - I'd be the biggest festering heap of human waste\\
251 - that ever lived!\\
252 - All you have to do is tell her that you wanna invest\\
253 - and give her my $100,000.\\
254 - Well, fine, but velvet is whore-ish.\\
255 - Okay, here we are. Uh, let's see..\\
256 - This is a cute, little shift that goes from day to night.\\
257 - - I love them all! - What?\\
258 - You-you haven't even seen them.\\
259 - I've seen all I need to see, Kate.\\
260 - I want to invest in your line of clothing.\\
261 - - Really? - Yes!\\
262 - Now tell me, what's our business plan?\\
263 - It depends, if I had enough money\\
264 - I'd put a show together for Fashion Week in New York.\\
265 - - That way I'd be able to-- - Sounds great.\\
266 - Pack your bags for New York\\
267 - because I'm gonna write you a check for $50,000.\\
268 - - What? - What?\\
269 - - Sam, did you hear that? - Yeah, I did.\\
270 - - What's this $50,000? - I-I know it's a lot.\\
271 - But I-I believe in her, and I want to take a chance.\\
272 - If you really believe in her, maybe you'd..\\
273 - Maybe you'd like to invest more.\\
274 - - Sam! - No, no, no. He's right.\\
275 - I'm gonna hate myself for this.\\
276 - But what the heck.\\
277 - $60,000.\\
278 - [laughing]\\
279 -     Men       \\
280 - I can't believe Alan gave me a $100,000.\\
281 - I can't believe it took him two hours to do it.\\
282 - Thank you.\\
283 - What are you thanking me for?\\
284 - Because I know none of this would've happened without you.\\
285 - I just introduced you.\\
286 - Your whore-ish velvet did the rest.\\
287 - [laughing]\\
288 - You are the sweetest..\\
289 - ...most generous..\\
290 - ...open, giving..\\
291 - caring, genuine person I've ever met, Sam Wilson.\\
292 - [chuckles] That's me.\\
293 - Good old, Sam Wilson.\\
294 - This whole thing is incredible.\\
295 - - I'm so excited. - Yeah, me too.\\
296 - - Are you sure? - What do you mean?\\
297 - Well, it just seems like, um\\
298 - Little Sam doesn't have his head in the game.\\
299 - Um, yeah.\\
300 - Maybe I just need a minute.\\
301 - Okay.\\
302 - Do you think I'm fat?\\
303 -     Men       \\
304 -     Men       \\
305 - - Alan, wake up. - Mm, what, what?\\
306 - Walden! What-what am I doing in your bed? I..\\
307 - I-I must have been sleepwalking, I..\\
308 - Alright, just relax, Alan, I just want to talk.\\
309 - What's going on? It's 3:00 in the morning.\\
310 - I-I haven't been able to sleep.\\
311 - In-In fact, my whole life is falling apart.\\
312 - I'm like, I'm losing my hair, I'm gaining weight\\
313 - I'm all itchy and twitchy, I..\\
314 - I-I haven't had a solid stool in a week.\\
315 - So far, you're describing my typical Tuesday.\\
316 - The-The worst part is..\\
317 - ...I can't get an erection.\\
318 - [sighs] Alright, just let me brush my teeth.\\
319 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, uh..\\
320 - - What? - What?\\
321 - Oh, uh, yeah, you know, I'm kind of I'm kind of half-asleep.\\
322 - Yeah, wow. Wow, that's a.. That is a problem.\\
323 - Yeah, yeah.\\
324 - Has this ever happened to you before?\\
325 - Oh, me? No, no. I, uh, I have amazing control.\\
326 - Wait-wait, watch-watch this.\\
327 - Got an erection.\\
328 - Now it's gone.\\
329 - Back.\\
330 - Gone.\\
331 - - Are you done? - Back.\\
332 - Gone.\\
333 - Look, every guy has this happen at some point.\\
334 - It's never happened to me before and it's driving me crazy.\\
335 - It's possible that the problem is not in your pants.\\
336 - Oh, no, no, no, no.\\
337 - The problem is definitely in my pants.\\
338 - No, look at you, the stress of living a lie\\
339 - is causing you to just fall apart.\\
340 - - You're binge eating. - No, I am not binge eating.\\
341 - You get a free candy bar when you buy four corn dogs.\\
342 - That's just smart shopping.\\
343 - This all started when you became Sam Wilson\\
344 - and I submit to you that he's the one\\
345 - who can't pop his weasel, not Walden Schmidt.\\
346 - Why don't you just tell Kate the truth?\\
347 - I'm afraid if I'm honest with her now\\
348 - she'll just leave me.\\
349 - Okay, if you want your boner back\\
350 - you're gonna have to, tell her the truth\\
351 - and trust that the strength of your love\\
352 - will carry you through..\\
353 - Or?\\
354 - Or you're gonna need a little help.\\
355 - Alright, go brush your teeth.\\
356 - I'm kidding!\\
357 - [laughing] Yeah, yeah.\\
358 - 'Cause-'cause that'd be weird.\\
359 - [laughing]\\
360 - Look, what I meant was that I happen to know\\
361 - a 65-year-old man who'll give you a stiffy in no time.\\
362 - Okay, that also sounded weird.\\
363 - And it's back!\\
364 -     Men       \\
365 - Alright, Walden, how hard do you want it?\\
366 - Redwood tree, tungsten steel or Chinese algebra?\\
367 - I'm not looking to frighten anybody.\\
368 - Really? I like eyes to widen when I unsheathe the sword.\\
369 - Well, tell you what.\\
370 - I'll put together a little grab bag for you.\\
371 - I got one of those. I call it "Boner roulette."\\
372 - You never know what you're gonna get\\
373 - but you're a wiener every time.\\
374 - [laughing]\\
375 - I'm gonna start you off\\
376 - with a couple of pink ones here.\\
377 - These are good for a mid-week quickie.\\
378 - And these green ones I recommend for solo work.\\
379 - Oh! This one I call "Ouch."\\
380 - That's her, not you.\\
381 - Oh, oh, the purple ones.\\
382 - I couldn't remember where I lived.\\
383 - Knocked on every door in the neighborhood\\
384 - and not with my hand.\\
385 - And, Walden, this last one I'm throwing in here, um\\
386 - just take half of it, because, technically\\
387 - it's "Only for horses."\\
388 - Don't-don't I need a prescription for these?\\
389 - What are you, a cop?\\
390 - Don't worry, Russell, he's cool.\\
391 - Okay, well, there you go.\\
392 - And since you're a friend of a friend\\
393 - I should read you the possible side effects.\\
394 - "Headaches, dry mouth, blurred vision, facial flushing\\
395 - "inflamed bursa sac, vertigo, fits of rage\\
396 - "homicidal, patricidal, matricidal\\
397 - "and suicidal thoughts, stroke, anal leakage\\
398 - "explosive diarrhea, nipple discoloration, death\\
399 - and difficulty achieving an erection."\\
400 - Huh, that explains my yellow nipples.\\
401 - You know what? I..\\
402 - Maybe I'll just go with the basic little blue pill.\\
403 - Well, suit yourself, Sally.\\
404 - Here you go. Don't want these to go to waste.\\
405 - That little waitress down at Ruby Tuesday's is never\\
406 - gonna know what hit her.\\
407 -     Men       \\
408 - Sam?\\
409 - - What's going on? - Guess who's back.\\
410 - Well, hello! I haven't seen you in a while.\\
411 - Hey, Kate, I've missed you.\\
412 - Okay, that's creepy. I'm gonna stop doing that.\\
413 - Good, because I can't stay and I wouldn't want you\\
414 - to think it's because I wasn't enchanted\\
415 - by your talking penis.\\
416 - Where you going?\\
417 - I actually just came back to grab some designs.\\
418 - Plus, I've got a million things to do before I leave tomorrow.\\
419 - But I promise when I get back I'll make it up to you.\\
420 - And you!\\
421 - We'll be here.\\
422 - [door closing]\\
423 - Hold me.\\
424 - Shut up.\\
425 - Come on, we both know how this ends.\\
426 -     Men       \\
427 - Are you sure you don't want a ride to the airport?\\
428 - - No, Alan's sending a limo. - He's a class act.\\
429 - Yeah, I just, I just feel like I should come with you.\\
430 - Sam, I would love for you to come\\
431 - but I just wouldn't feel right spending Alan's money\\
432 - to fly my boyfriend across the country.\\
433 - And it's not like you or I have the money.\\
434 - What if I told you I had plenty of money?\\
435 - I would ask you why you didn't help me instead of Alan.\\
436 - That would be a fair question.\\
437 - Honey, you are so sweet.\\
438 - And hopefully one day\\
439 - money won't be an issue for us.\\
440 - I hope you're right.\\
441 - [cellphone beeping]\\
442 - Oh! That's the car. I got to go.\\
443 - Um, good luck.\\
444 - I'll miss you.\\
445 - I love you, Sam.\\
446 - My name is Walden Schmidt.\\
447 - I'm a billionaire.\\
448 - I love you too.\\
449 - I don't care what your name is.\\

451 -     Men       \\
452 - [knock on door]\\
453 - Hello?\\
454 - - Walden? - 'Alan?'\\
455 - [Walden] 'What do you want?'\\
456 - I'm just checking up on you, buddy.\\
457 - [Walden] 'I'm fine! Go away!'\\
458 - Uh, are you sure? I haven't seen you in a while.\\
459 - [Walden] 'I'm fine!'\\
460 - - Why is it so dark in here? - 'Alan, no!'\\
461 - Holy...fat!\\
462 - Don't judge me.\\
463 - You didn't, by chance, bring any nacho cheese, did you?\\

24 - Walden!\\
25 - What's happened to you?\\
26 - What do you mean?\\
27 - Uh, okay, I-I don't know how to say this\\
28 - umm, but you're either wearing a child's shirt\\

47 - Can you even see your penis past that gut?\\
48 - What? My penis is like Santa Claus.\\
49 - I don't need to see it I just need to believe in it.\\
50 - You know what I believe\\
51 - living a double life is killing you.\\
52 - You don't know what you're talking about.\\
53 - - So why don't you just go away? - You don't think you need help?\\

68 - ...hosed down and..\\
69 - ...back in shape and-and feeling like your old self again.\\
70 - - You think so? - Oh, absolutely.\\
71 - And-And after we do\\
72 - you're gonna call up Kate and tell her the truth.\\
73 - What? No, I can't.\\
74 - - You have to. - Why?\\
75 - Because the truth will set you free, and you know it.\\
76 - Okay. Maybe you're right.\\
77 - There you go.\\
78 - Plus, it'd be nice to lose the gut and see my penis again.\\
79 - And I'm sure he'd like to see you, too.\\

95 - [beeping]\\
96 - - Hey, you. - Hi, babe.\\
97 - How's the prep for the show going?\\
98 - Oh, my God.\\
99 - Everybody here is pretentious, bitchy and high.\\
100 - I love New York!\\
101 - Are you sure you're not Skyping from heaven?\\
102 - Because you appear to be surrounded by half-naked angels.\\
103 - Oh, yeah, that's Britte and Inga.\\
104 - I guess they're done throwing up their lunch.\\
105 - Well, I've got great news.\\
106 - I'll be there tomorrow.\\
107 - You do realize they'll be dressed by then.\\
108 - No,I'm coming to seeyou.\\
109 - But if the models are still there and we wind up\\
110 - getting in a pillow fight in our hotel bed, then so be it.\\
111 - [chuckles] Are you really coming?\\
112 - Yeah, and..\\
113 - ...I gotta big surprise for you.\\
114 - Oh.. Wait, hang on a sec.\\
115 - How can you afford a plane ticket?\\
116 - Well, Alan is flying me on his jet.\\
117 - Oh! Alan's coming, too.\\
118 - Yay.\\
119 - Don't worry about him.\\
120 - I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Oh, and do me a favor.\\
121 - Before I get there, make sure those models have clothes on.\\
122 - How do you feel about naughty school girl outfits?\\
123 - I find them degrading.\\
124 - And perfect.\\
125 - [chuckles]\\
126 - - I love you, Sam. - I love you.\\
127 - So did you tell her?\\
128 - No.\\
129 - I wanna tell her in person.\\
130 - 'So pack your bags.'\\
131 - We're going to New York.\\
132 - Me? Why am I going?\\
133 - This is really scary for me, Alan.\\
134 - I need the support of my friend.\\
135 - Well, you got it.\\
136 - - Thank you. - Uh, uh, Walden--\\
137 - Yes, I'll cover your expenses.\\
138 - - Great. Umm-- - Yes, I'll give you per diem.\\
139 - If he ever gets a real friend, I'm screwed.\\
140 -     Men       \\
141 - You know what we should do in New York? Go see a musical.\\
142 - Yeah, maybe.\\
143 - If I put my life back together.\\
144 - Of course.\\
145 - So what are you thinking, Jersey Boys?\\
146 -     Walk like aman    \\
147 -     Talk like aman      \\
148 - I don't really have a preference.\\
149 - Can't go wrong with Wicked.\\
150 - Sure.\\
151 - Then again, Mamma Mia.\\
152 - I can never see that show enough.\\
153 - I own the movie on Blu-ray.\\
154 - Two words. Delightful romp.\\
155 - You do realize the whole point of this trip is to\\
156 - tell the woman I love that I'm actually someone else?\\
157 - Oh, I get it.\\
158 - If that story was on Broadway, I'd see it in a heartbeat.\\
159 - Walden Schmidt in Les Mis-Representation\\
160 - of Who he Is.\\
161 - - Thanks for the support. - Oh,comeon.\\
162 - Lighten up. Everything's gonna be fine.\\
163 - I hope she doesn't like Sam more than she likes Walden.\\
164 - Why would she?\\
165 - Well, a lot of reasons. One, Sam's better in bed.\\
166 - - What? - He tries harder.\\
167 - He has to compensate for all the other things he doesn't have.\\
168 - He's banging scared.\\
169 - If that's true, I'd be the best lay on the planet.\\
170 - I just don't wanna lose her.\\
171 - Oh, you won't.\\
172 - But it's fun to lose yourself in the magic of Broadway.\\
173 - - Alan. - Fine.\\
174 - Well, it's too bad you're in a relationship.\\
175 - Kate's show will be packed with half-naked supermodels.\\
176 - S-Supermodels?\\
177 - - Yeah. - Wow.\\
178 - Excuse me a second. I'm-I'm gonna make a call.\\
179 - My girl.\\
180 - - Hey, Lyndsey. - Hey, what's up?\\
181 - [Alan] 'I'm on Walden's jet.'\\
182 - I'm flying to New York City.\\
183 - [Lyndsey] 'For what?'\\
184 - A fashion show, maybe take in a musical.\\
185 - Ah! Guys' weekend.\\
186 - Yes, exactly.\\
187 - Um, so anyhow, I just wanted to..\\
188 - ...make sure you still love me.\\
189 - Of course I do. Why would you even ask?\\
190 - Well, you know, I'm on a plane.\\
191 - You know, anything can happen at any time.\\
192 - Don't worry, Alan. I love you.\\
193 - 'And we're gonna be together forever.'\\
194 - O-Okay, sweetie. I love you, too. Bye-bye.\\
195 - Son of a bitch.\\
196 -     Men       \\
197 - Oh, my! Oh, my!\\
198 - Oh, oh, gee, so, so tall, so\\
199 - so very tall, oh, oh\\
200 - that-that, that's an 11.\\
201 - And and now we've got a-a 12.\\
202 - Oh, God, can you believe this?\\
203 - All these beautiful women, and I'm off the market.\\
204 - Yeah! 'cause that's what models are looking for\\
205 - a middle-aged, twice divorced, broke-ass guy\\
206 - who lives in a guest room with a dehumidifier\\
207 - and my old tax returns.\\
208 - Ooh, I make enough money to pay taxes.\\
209 - Rub my nose in it.\\
210 - I'm just nervous, I don't know if I can do this.\\
211 - I feel like I'm gonna puke.\\
212 - This is the place for it.\\
213 - Grab a feather and get in line.\\
214 - [Kate] 'Sam!'\\
215 - Hi, Kate.\\
216 - Hi.\\
217 - [Kate chuckles]\\
218 - Alan, it's so good to..\\
219 - Alan!\\
220 - I'm very, very happy for you.\\
221 - I hope this fashion show brings you all the success.\\
222 - - Thank you. - Why don't I..\\
223 - ...leave you two alone while I fill my head\\
224 - with images to think of\\
225 - when I'm having sex with the woman I love.\\
226 - I am so happy you're here.\\
227 - I wouldn't miss it for the world.\\
228 - So, what's this big surprise\\
229 - you had to fly all the way to New York to talk to me about?\\
230 - Yeah, the surpriseis..\\
231 - Okay, uh..\\
232 - - Close your eyes. - Alright.\\
233 - Kate, I'd like you to meet Walden Schmidt.\\
234 - I don't understand.\\
235 - My name's not Sam Wilson.\\
236 - It's Walden Schmidt.\\
237 - What?\\
238 -     Walk like a man Talk like a man    \\
239 -     Walk like a man, my son    \\
240 -     No woman's worth..       \\
241 -     Men       \\
242 -     Men       \\
243 - Wait a sec.\\
244 - Your name's not Sam Wilson?\\
245 - No.\\
246 - And I'm not broke, either.\\
247 - I have a lot of money.\\
248 - In fact, I have more than a lot.\\
249 - Like, think about a lot of money\\
250 - and then multiply it by ten..\\
251 - ...thousand.\\
252 - But how is this possible?\\
253 - You worked at a Christmas tree lot.\\
254 - You didn't chip in on the rent.\\
255 - I saw you use toilet paper as a coffee filter.\\
256 - That's only because the day before\\
257 - I used the last coffee filter as toilet paper.\\
258 - Okay. Why are you doing this, Sam?\\
259 - It's not Sam.\\
260 - - It's Walden. - Okay, whatever your name is!\\
261 - Why would you lie about who you are?\\
262 - Because I wanted to meet someone like you.\\
263 - Someone who's kind and genuine\\
264 - and sweet and not after my money.\\
265 - Someone that I felt like, I had a real connection with.\\
266 - So, to make sure you could trust me\\
267 - you lied to me?\\
268 - I'm really sorry.\\
269 - I-I got caught up in it\\
270 - then I-I couldn't figure out how to get out, and it..\\
271 - Trust me, you are the most amazing person I've ever met.\\
272 - I love you\\
273 - whether I'm Sam Wilson or Walden Schmidt.\\
274 - Well, good for you.\\
275 - Unfortunately, I have no idea who Walden Schmidt is.\\
276 - Kate, wait.\\
277 - You know what?\\
278 - This whole time\\
279 - I thought he was the douche.\\
280 - Turns out you're the douche.\\
281 - Unbelievable!\\
282 - She likes me.\\
283 -     Men       \\
284 - How you doing?\\
285 - I've been better.\\
286 - Aw, I'm sorry, buddy.\\
287 - You know what might cheer you up?\\
288 - There are still tickets for tonight's performance\\
289 - of Jersey Boys.\\
290 - We're not going to Jersey Boys.\\
291 - Oh, I totally get it.\\
292 - Lion King it is.\\
293 - We're not going to any musical at all.\\
294 - Fine.\\
295 - I just don't understand why we both have to be depressed.\\
296 - I don't think she's ever going to forgive me.\\
297 - Why would she?\\
298 - I mean, I-I-I lied to her about everything.\\
299 - I don't wanna give anything away\\
300 - in case you change your mind and we do go, but when\\
301 - Simba lies to his friends\\
302 - by not telling them that he's the Lion King\\
303 - they forgive him after a few short but snappy dance numbers.\\
304 - Life is not a musical, Alan.\\
305 - So knock it off.\\
306 - See, that wouldn't have hurt so much if you'd sung it.\\
307 - I'm sorry, I'm-I'm just upset.\\
308 - I mean, I did, what I did for love.\\
309 - Am I really that bad of a guy?\\
310 -     You're a douche you're a douche    \\
311 -     You're a big fizzy douche    \\
312 -     You broke that poor girl's heart    \\
313 -     You're a douche you're a douche    \\
314 -     You're a big fizzy douche    \\
315 -     You should have told the truth right from the start    \\
316 -     But my intentions were good I was no slave to my wood    \\
317 -     I wanted her to love me for me    \\
318 -     He does have lots of riches which attracts lot of bitches    \\
319 -     Thank you, Alan, but you'll never be on Glee    \\
320 -     Aw crap    \\
321 -     If I may throw in my two cents    \\
322 -     Your love was based on a pretense    \\
323 -     Your relationship with mother is to blame    \\
324 -     You didn't suckle on her boobies    \\
325 -     You self-medicate with doobies    \\
326 -     Which explains why you used a made-up name    \\
327 -     Cue the refrain    \\
328 -     You're a douche you're a douche    \\
329 -     You're a big fizzy douche    \\
330 -     Everything you said was a lie    \\
331 -     You're a douche you're a douche    \\
332 -     You're a big fizzy douche    \\
333 -     But you're still a really, really handsome guy    \\
334 -     Thank you Then what am I to do    \\
335 -     So I don't always live with you    \\
336 -     Wow that hurts my feelings    \\
337 -     But since I live there beneath your ceilings    \\
338 -     I'll bite the pillow like the prison bitches do    \\
339 -     Woo-oh    \\
340 -     If she gives me one more chance    \\
341 -     We can have a real romance    \\
342 -     If she doesn't we can party in my pants    \\
343 -     Excuse me no disrespect But I have to interject    \\
344 -     What makes you think you can steal the show    \\
345 -     'Cause I'm gay    \\
346 -     Oh you're so clearly from L.A.    \\
347 -     Yes I'm gay    \\
348 -     And he will always be that way    \\
349 -     I'm gay    \\
350 -     Or as his Jersey friends would say    \\
351 -     A-yo badda bing he's a big ol' 'mo    \\
352 -     Excuse me but we seem to be digressing    \\
353 -     And I find it to be quite distressing    \\
354 -     Can we sing about the problem that's at hand    \\
355 -     Can Kate get over Sam and love who I am    \\
356 -     You confusin' me for someone who gives a damn    \\
357 -     So bottom line    \\
358 -     You're a douche you're a douche    \\
359 -     You're a big fizzy douche    \\
360 -     And I'll die sad and alone    \\
361 -     You're a douche you're a douche    \\
362 -     You're a big fizzy douche    \\

403 - Hey!\\
404 - Hey!\\
405 - How'd the show go?\\
406 - It was pretty amazing, actually.\\
407 - The buyer from Neiman Marcus is interested in my stuff.\\
408 - That's great.\\
409 - About halfway through the show, I realized that\\
410 - Alan probably didn't pay for this, did he?\\
411 - No.\\
412 - But if the models ask, throw him a bone.\\
413 - [chuckles]\\
414 - Thank you.\\
415 - I'm really sorry.\\
416 - Do you think that there's a way that we can make this work?\\
417 - I don't know.\\
418 - I mean, I trusted you, and..\\
419 - ...you didn't trust me.\\
420 - Now I don't even know who you are.\\
421 - Well, if you think about it, I'm really the same guy.\\
422 - I just have a better watch\\
423 - better car\\
424 - 'better house'\\
425 - 'better..'\\
426 - ...jet.\\
427 - So nothing about you is real.\\
428 - What's real is that I love you.\\
429 - Okay!\\
430 - Well..\\
431 - ...I'm gonna need some time..\\
432 - ...to process all of this.\\
433 - So..\\
434 - ...you think..\\
435 - ...maybe when we get back to L.A.\\
436 - - I'm not going back to L.A. - What?\\
437 - Yeah, thanks to you, I..\\
438 - ...might have a life here now.\\
439 - Wow!\\
440 - I didn't think any of this through, did I?\\
441 - Apparently not, Walden Smith.\\
442 - It's actually Schmidt.\\
443 - You know, it's not important.\\
444 - So, I guess I'll just..\\
445 - ...wait to hear from you.\\
446 - I guess so.\\
447 - Good-bye, Sam.\\
448 - [footsteps]\\
449 - It's Walden.\\
450 - Hey, look who needs a ride back to L.A.\\
451 - Yeah! Alan the billionaire's got a big jet.\\
452 - It slipped out while they were running away from me.\\
453 -     Men       \\
454 -     Men       \\
455 - Ooh, too much champagne!\\
456 - They are..\\
457 - ...awfully pretty.\\

459 - You, uh, you gonna?\\
460 - [indistinct chattering]\\
461 - Not, I'm not interested.\\
462 - Oh-ho, me, neither.\\
463 - You know, I've a girlfriend.\\
464 - But, you know, if we could..\\
465 - ...which-which one would you choose?\\
466 - [indistinct chattering]\\
467 - Probably the brunette.\\
468 - Really? The brunette?\\
469 - Oh, you want the brunette?\\
470 - Oh, me? No, I..\\
471 - ...I said, you know the aforementioned girlfriend.\\
472 - Although..\\
473 - ...Lyndsey is a blonde and..\\
474 - ...the brunette would make a very nice palate cleanser.\\
475 - You know, uh, hypothetically.\\
476 - Fine, you can have the brunette.\\
477 - Hypothetically.\\
478 - If we're talking hypothetically\\
479 - it's my plane, you're not here, and I'm taking them both.\\
480 - Right. Are we done with this?\\
481 - Hypothetically.\\
482 - So, uh, I assume you're moving back into the beach house.\\
483 - - Yeah. - Good. Good.\\
484 - The place felt empty without you.\\
485 - Oh,please.You loved every minute of it.\\
486 - I did. I really did.\\

491 - I'm just gonna miss waking up next to Kate every morning.\\
492 - I'm gonna miss driving your fancy sports car.\\
493 - I'm gonna miss the way she held my hand when we watched a movie.\\
494 - I'm gonna miss the way your underwear\\
495 - felt fresh from the dryer.\\

\subsection {Episode 14: Run Steven Staven Run}
1 -     Men       \\
2 - Sorry, I'm late.\\
3 - I've been waiting here for over an hour.\\
4 - I'd to pee in that bush.\\
5 - I shudder to think what you used to wipe.\\
6 - Did you knock on the door to see if Walden and Berta were home?\\
7 - Yeah, they invited me in, but I said I'd rather pee\\
8 - on my feet while an azalea tickled my crack.\\
9 - Okay, actually, it's, uh, it's an oleander.\\
10 - That's probably not the salient part of your story.\\
11 - You know, none of this would have happened if I had a key.\\
12 - Uh, come on. We've been over this.\\
13 - I just, I feel like I'm overstepping my boundaries\\
14 - with Walden by asking if my girlfriend can have a key.\\
15 - Well, I feel like an unwelcome guest in this house.\\
16 - I'm an unwelcome guest in this house.\\
17 - You know, I don't think you're taking me seriously.\\
18 - Isn't it enough that you have the key to my heart?\\
19 - Oh, bite me.\\
20 - Okay, I get it. I get it.\\
21 - You're upset, and you have every right to be.\\
22 - But why don't we just, you know, take a deep breath\\
23 - maybe open a bottle of wine\\
24 - uh, take a bath,\\
25 - light some candles.\\
26 - Do you actually believe\\
27 - I'm gonna have sex with you?\\
28 - I can't believe you ever have sex with me.\\
29 - But you're here now. You look lovely.\\
30 - You have an empty bladder, so why not?\\
31 - You know what? Keep the key.\\
32 - Ah, Lyndsey, come on.\\
33 - Don't be like this.\\
34 - What, you're just going to mark your territory and leave?\\
35 - Son of a bitch.\\
36 - [Lyndsey] 'Bet you wish you gave me that key now.'\\
37 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\
38 -     Hah-ah ah    \\
39 -     Men       \\
40 -     Men       \\
41 - Ah..\\
42 - Ah..\\
43 - You're gonna keep doing that until I ask you what's wrong\\
44 - aren't you?\\
45 - What's wrong?\\
46 - Kate updated her Facebook status.\\
47 - Still no mention of me.\\
48 - Let it go.\\
49 - She's eating a bagel.\\
50 - We used to eat bagels.\\
51 - Here.\\
52 - Now you're eating bagels together.\\
53 - - I miss her. - Oh, boo-hoo.\\
54 - I miss waking up next to Burt Reynolds.\\
55 - What, it happened.\\
56 - - Morning. - Morning.\\
57 - Where-where's Lyndsey?\\
58 - I thought she was spending the night.\\
59 - Me, too. But then she decided I suck.\\
60 - - Why? - Did it take her so long?\\
61 - I don't know what happened.\\
62 - It just came out of nowhere.\\
63 - It always does.\\
64 - You know who knew relationships? Your brother.\\
65 - [scoffs] Oh, please, his lasted an hour at a time.\\
66 - An hour and a half if he was drunk.\\
67 - Exactly. He treated women like rental cars.\\
68 - You pay for them when you need them\\
69 - and it's someone else's job\\
70 - to empty out the trunk and hose them down.\\
71 - Well, I'm not paying for sex.\\
72 - And he can't afford to.\\
73 - I don't need a hooker. I have Lyndsey.\\
74 - You should lead with that when you apologize to her.\\
75 - Oh, we will be fine.\\
76 - This whole thing will blow over and be gone by tomorrow morning.\\
77 - So would the hooker.\\
78 -     Men       \\
79 - Hey.\\
80 - Well, well, well, look who finally decided\\
81 - to grace us with his presence.\\
82 - I needed some time. Kate and I split up.\\
83 - - Another woman left you? - She moved to New York.\\
84 - [laughing]\\
85 - They're crossing state lines to get away from you now.\\
86 - Yeah, yeah.\\
87 - I'm a loser. I'm alone.\\
88 - And meanwhile, you're having wild, crazy sex\\
89 - with my ex-wife like I could never imagine.\\
90 - Oh, you don't have to imagine it.\\
91 - Look, let me-let me paint you a word picture.\\
92 - Uh, the candles were flickering..\\
93 - ...the music was playing..\\
94 - ...and she rode me like I was a giant, pink pogo stick.\\
95 - You're not a giant anything.\\
96 - That's funny.\\
97 - You know what else is funny?\\
98 - You're alone.\\
99 - Okay, I get it. It's a joke.\\
100 - Women always leave me. I get it.\\
101 - Well, you know what? It still hurts.\\
102 - Not that I expect you to understand how it feels\\
103 - to have your heart broken by someone you love\\
104 - because that would actually require you having a heart.\\
105 - 'Do you even know how it feels--'\\
106 - She dumped me.\\
107 - What?\\
108 - Bridget left me.\\
109 - Are you serious?\\
110 - She-She said I was inconsiderate, condescending\\
111 - and that I look like a lesbian art teacher.\\
112 - I-I don't know what to say.\\
113 - Other than you do look like a lesbian art teacher.\\
114 - I'm glad that my pain can make you happy.\\
115 - Oh, wait, you have no idea.\\
116 - Let me paint you a word picture.\\
117 - Flowers are blooming.\\
118 - Birds are singing.\\
119 - Angels are farting rainbows.\\
120 - That's not funny, alright?\\
121 - My-my life is falling apart.\\
122 - Come on. I'm just giving you a hard time.\\
123 - I'm sorry.\\
124 - It's gonna be okay.\\
125 - No, it's not. I loved her.\\
126 - I know. I did, too.\\
127 - And then I realized she's the broken one.\\
128 - - You think so? - Yeah, of course, I..\\
129 - She dumped me to be with you. I mean..\\
130 - [whistling]\\
131 - - Hey, that-- - Shh, it gets better.\\
132 -     Men       \\
133 - Here ya go.\\
134 - We got chicken and star soup\\
135 - and grilled cheese sandwich with the crust cut off.\\
136 - I-I got dumped by my girlfriend\\
137 - not pushed off the monkey bars at recess.\\
138 - And that's why I put whiskey in your sippy cup.\\
139 - [Alan] What's going on?\\
140 - Oh, Billy got dumped by Bridget.\\
141 - Oh, man, I'm sorry.\\
142 - Ah, me and my girlfriend are going through\\
143 - a bit of a rough patch ourselves.\\
144 - So, she sewed you up in your sheets while you were sleeping\\
145 - and started beating you with a broom?\\
146 - Uh, no.\\
147 - Then it's not a rough patch.\\
148 - What is it that makes relationships so difficult?\\
149 - - Women. - Women.\\
150 - Exactly.\\
151 - I mean, when was the last time you were dating someone\\
152 - and you decided to ask\\
153 - "Where is this relationship going?"\\
154 - Or "Are you mad at me?"\\
155 - Yeah, or "What's all this glittery, sparkly stuff\\
156 - on your pants?"\\
157 - And guys ask questions that you can answer.\\
158 - Like, "How are we fixed for ham? "\\
159 - [sighing]\\
160 - Why is my beer empty?\\
161 - God, I hate it when Lyndsey asks me that.\\
162 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
163 - Wait, were we doing guys' or girls' questions?\\
164 - Yeah, on the other hand, there's no better feeling\\
165 - than when you're in a loving, happy relationship.\\
166 - The sweet release of black tar heroin's a close second.\\
167 - Well, the good news is neither one of you guys\\
168 - are going to be single for long.\\
169 - I mean, you got looks and money.\\
170 - Thank you, Alan.\\
171 - And you've got...money.\\
172 - That's true.\\
173 - Yeah, and what about you? You got..\\
174 - ...most of your hair.\\
175 - Both eyes.\\
176 - Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, no, you've got a..\\
177 - You've got--\\
178 - To go apologize to my girlfriend.\\
179 - [Billy] 'Exactly.'\\
180 - By the way, how are we fixed for ham?\\
181 -     Men       \\
182 - - Alan. - Wow.\\
183 - - Oh, uh, hey-hey, Lyndsey. - What are you doing here?\\
184 - Well, I've left you a few messages since yesterday.\\
185 - I don't know if you got them.\\
186 - I did.\\
187 - Oh, o-okay.\\
188 - Well, you look nice.\\
189 - Did someone die?\\
190 - I'm going out.\\
191 - Ooh, girls' night out?\\
192 - - No. - Oh.\\
193 - Did someone die?\\
194 - I have a date with Dr. Staven.\\
195 - Wait, Dr. Staven, your-your gynecologist?\\
196 - That's right.\\
197 - Is-is this about the other night?\\
198 - Because I said I was sorry.\\
199 - Look, if it'll make you feel better\\
200 - you can lock me out and I'll pee in your bush.\\
201 - Okay, that came out much worse than I meant it.\\
202 - Okay, I have to get going.\\
203 - Are you mad at me?\\
204 - No, we just have different ideas\\
205 - of what a relationship should be.\\
206 - Well, then let's just sit down and talk about it.\\
207 - Nothing to talk about.\\
208 - Oh, yeah, right. Like a woman is ever done..\\
209 - She's mad at me.\\
210 - They're hot when they're angry, aren't they?\\
211 - Oh, Herb.\\
212 - Geez, you scared me.\\
213 - Little trouble in paradise?\\
214 - Oh, yeah, you know, relationships..\\
215 - You wanna come across the street\\
216 - for a beer and talk about it?\\
217 - Oh, sure. Thanks.\\
218 - So, uh, what are you doing over here anyway?\\
219 - Oh, just seeing if Lyndsey's coming out for her 6:15 jog.\\
220 - - Oh, you jog with her? - No.\\
221 -     Men       \\
222 - Oh, you know, I don't think\\
223 - Judith is going to be too happy to see me.\\
224 - Oh, don't worry. She's gone.\\
225 - Okay, when you say "Gone"\\
226 - do you mean she's traveling\\
227 - or is her head in that cooler?\\
228 - She left me, Alan.\\
229 - Oh, my God, what happened?\\
230 - Yeah, I had a moment of weakness with my receptionist.\\
231 - Actually, 36 and a half moments of weakness.\\
232 - - Uh, a half? - Judith walked in during 37.\\
233 - Herb, how could you?\\
234 - This is my receptionist.\\
235 - I would have finished 37 while she was watching.\\
236 -     Men       \\
237 -     Men       \\
238 - Hey, man, thanks for inviting me over.\\
239 - I really appreciate it.\\
240 - Ah, come on, you'd do the same thing for me.\\
241 - We both know that's not true\\
242 - but it's sweet of you to say.\\
243 - And besides, breakups are like a bruise\\
244 - and I want to be there when yours turns from dark purple\\
245 - to yellow.\\
246 - That is the meanest thing you've ever said.\\
247 - Kudos.\\
248 - Okay, here's a question.\\
249 - - Who's your dream schtupp? - What?\\
250 - Any woman in the world, one night, who's it going to be?\\
251 - Oh, that's easy. Kate.\\
252 - Oh, see, right there. That's why I wouldn't have you over.\\
253 - Who picks their ex-girlfriend?\\
254 - I mean, I'm talking any woman in the world.\\
255 - Okay, dead or alive?\\
256 - [scoffs] It doesn't matter.\\
257 - - Do I have to know her? - Nope.\\
258 - What if she doesn't like me?\\
259 - I.. For the love of God.\\
260 - In the game she has to like you.\\
261 - Okay.\\
262 - Can she be animated?\\
263 - Like a, like a cartoon?\\
264 - Like, you want to be chomped by Ms. Pacman?\\
265 - No, but I always had these weird feelings\\
266 - when I used to see Bugs Bunny in drag.\\
267 - Fine, she can be animated.\\
268 - - Her place or mine? - Who cares?\\
269 - I do. It's hard for me to relax in strange surroundings.\\
270 - Okay, you know what? Just forget it.\\
271 - But-but I didn't pick a girl.\\
272 - Just shut up. You ruin everything.\\
273 - Mother Teresa.\\
274 - What?\\
275 - That woman gave her whole life\\
276 - for the benefit of mankind.\\
277 - And one man should give her a little something back.\\
278 - Hey, guys.\\
279 - - Oh, hey. Hey! - Hi.\\
280 - Oh, Alan's girlfriend is taller than I would have thought.\\
281 - Herb, uh, you remember Walden. This is Billy.\\
282 - Oh. Hello, Billy.\\
283 - Alan tells me you got, uh, dumped by Walden's ex-wife.\\
284 - Yeah, I got dumped by Alan's ex-wife.\\
285 - I guess that makes us dump brothers.\\
286 - That's, uh..\\
287 - Who is this guy?\\
288 - You don't recognize your own dump brother?\\
289 - Herb is the most recent victim\\
290 - of Judith's unrelenting assault on mankind.\\
291 - Oh, it sounds like just the kind of horrible\\
292 - ball-breaker I always end up with.\\
293 - - Mm-hmm. - She available?\\
294 - Not emotionally.\\
295 - And she's only physically available twice a year.\\
296 - Twice? Uh, birthdays and Valentine's Day.\\
297 - Oh, that explains it.\\
298 - My birthday's on Valentine's Day.\\
299 - I thought you were going to see Lyndsey.\\
300 - I did, right as she was going out on a date.\\
301 - - Yikes. - Gut-punch.\\
302 - With her gynecologist.\\
303 - - Shut up! - What?\\
304 - That man is a trained vagina handler.\\
305 - You do not want him down there.\\
306 - - He's already been down there. - Yeah, on business.\\
307 - You don't want him to return on a pleasure cruise.\\
308 - I mean, I mean, he could take apart\\
309 - and reassemble her undercarriage blindfolded.\\
310 - You're more like a guy trying to put a bookshelf\\
311 - together from IKEA.\\
312 - Well, you know what? I don't care. I don't need her.\\
313 - - That's a good attitude. - Mm-hmm.\\
314 - Exactly. Who needs women?\\
315 - - Not me. - Me, neither.\\
316 - Know what we should do?\\
317 - Go to a bar and pick up some women?\\
318 - - Yeah. - Yeah.\\
319 -     Men       \\
320 - Alright, this is not gonna be that hard.\\
321 - I mean, look at us. We've got a doctor\\
322 - a billionaire, another billionaire.\\
323 - Billionaire's permanent houseguest.\\
324 - Ooh, he said I'm permanent.\\
325 - Check out the talent at three o'clock.\\
326 - Oh, oh, oh.\\
327 - Hotsy-totsy!\\
328 - Oh, I got dibs on the blonde.\\
329 - Oh, who's taking the manly one? What manly one?\\
330 - Herb's got the one with the Adam's apple.\\
331 - Okay, what are we gonna do here, guys?\\
332 - You know, uh, what's the plan?\\
333 - I mean, uh, teams of two, every man for himself\\
334 - uh, shock and awe?\\
335 - Or we just send in the tall, handsome guy\\
336 - with the Big Johnson.\\
337 - - I'll see what I can do. - Oh, not you. Pretty boy here.\\
338 - Well, I am more than just a pretty face.\\
339 - Come on, man. You can be like the-the great white shark\\
340 - and we'll be the plucky little pilot fish\\
341 - who swim alongside you and feed off your scraps.\\
342 - Why do I have to be cursed with all of this?\\
343 - Back off.\\
344 - I will seal the deal.\\
345 - I've seen this movie before.\\
346 - You're going to enjoy it.\\
347 - Hi. I hate to interrupt,\\
348 - so I'm just gonna cut right to the chase.\\
349 - I'm neither tall, nor handsome, but I'm incredibly rich.\\
350 - So which of you would like the honor\\
351 - of sleeping with me for $5,000?\\
352 - I apologize.\\
353 - Ten thousand.\\
354 - [scoffs]\\
355 - [clearing throat]\\
356 - Gentlemen, the bar has been lowered.\\
357 -     Men       \\
358 - This is a great idea, Herb.\\
359 - We shouldn't call him Herb.\\
360 - We should call him Erb.\\
361 - [laughing]\\
362 - Well, as a doctor, I have access to some\\
363 - pretty righteous chronic.\\
364 - You're a pediatrician.\\
365 - I prescribe it to the parents.\\
366 - This would be way better\\
367 - if there were four hot women in here.\\
368 - Yeah, and none of you.\\
369 - Please, the only way you could satisfy four women\\
370 - is if they were cannibals.\\
371 - [laughing]\\
372 - Okay. Yeah. Look, I will have you know\\
373 - I have no trouble satisfying multiple women.\\
374 - In fact, that's kind of the reason\\
375 - I ended in this big bowl of sausage soup.\\
376 - What do you mean?\\
377 - Bridget and I would enjoy the occasional threesome.\\
378 - And by "Occasional," I mean every Friday, Saturday,\\
379 - and Sunday night.\\
380 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Bridget, like, my Bridget?\\
381 - Yup. She was a weekend warrior.\\
382 - Wow. The closest we ever came to a threesome\\
383 - was one time we dog-sat, and I left the bedroom door open.\\
384 - Me and that beagle made eye contact\\
385 - at the most inopportune moment.\\
386 - Oh, my God.\\
387 - Well, hey, hey, hey. One word of advice.\\
388 - Do not look up from the lap of a girl\\
389 - you just picked up at Safeway and say to your girlfriend\\
390 - "My God, I never want this to end!"\\
391 - Aah, threesomes never work out.\\
392 - Somebody always feels left out.\\
393 - That's why my receptionist and I got another couple and swing.\\
394 - Ooh! Stringbean's a freak. I like it.\\
395 - Yeah, if you and, uh, Bridget ever get back together\\
396 - maybe she'd like to become a herb-ivore.\\
397 - I will keep that in mind.\\
398 - Okay, so I lied\\
399 - to the woman I love about who I am.\\
400 - Herb cheated on his wife.\\
401 - And Billy spent too much time\\
402 - yodeling in the wrong canyon.\\
403 - Why did you and Lyndsey break up?\\
404 - She wanted a key to the house.\\
405 - And?\\
406 - And I said no.\\
407 - Why?\\
408 - Well, it's-it's not mine to give. It's your house.\\
409 - Since when does that matter to you?\\
410 - Since I don't want my girlfriend\\
411 - to have unrestricted access to my house.\\
412 - And we're back to your house.\\
413 - I like my space!\\
414 - I-I want to keep my options open.\\
415 - Options? You have op-shun.\\
416 - "Shun" as in, all other girls shun you.\\
417 - Look, Alan, don't be a schmuck.\\
418 - If you're gonna throw away your relationship\\
419 - do it for a good reason.\\
420 - Like spending too much time face down in the checkout girl.\\
421 - Yeah, or, uh, fooling around\\
422 - with your hot, young receptionist\\
423 - who lets you wear a diaper while riding her around the office.\\
424 - Is one example.\\
425 - Nobody's gonna think about that next time we see you.\\
426 - My point is, you're the only one of us\\
427 - who has a chance to get his girl back.\\
428 - What about all that stuff about not needing women?\\
429 - We only said that because we don't have women.\\
430 - - Really? - Of course, Lyndsey is awesome.\\
431 - She really is. She's got the face of an angel\\
432 - buttocks you can bounce a quarter off\\
433 - and a bosom that just makes you wish she was your mother.\\
434 - But I'm saying she's awesome.\\
435 - Just give her the key, Alan. Give her anything she wants.\\
436 - Well, it's a little late. She's out with another guy.\\
437 - Well, no, it's not too late.\\
438 - Go get her. Go do it for yourself.\\
439 - Do it for all of us who can't get our girl back.\\
440 - - Yeah! - Come on, go get her.\\
441 - - Okay, okay, you're right. - Yeah.\\
442 - You're right. I'm gonna do it!\\
443 - I'm gonna do it for all of us! There you go.\\
444 - Oh.\\
445 - I cannot believe he is our only hope.\\
446 -     Men       \\
447 - [sighing]\\
448 - I don't know what the problem is.\\
449 - This is delightful. Oh!\\
450 - - Oh, boy. - Alan?\\
451 - Oh, Lyndsey. Lyndsey, hi. Hi.\\
452 - I-I just need two minutes.\\
453 - Were you peeing in my bushes?\\
454 - What? No. No. Hi. I'm, uh.. I'm Alan Harper.\\
455 - No, thanks.\\
456 - Alan, this is not a good time.\\
457 - Okay, just-just hear me out, okay?\\
458 - Look, she said this wasn't a good time.\\
459 - - 'Get him!' - Whoa, whoa.\\
460 - Walden, Herb, what are you doing?\\
461 - - You'll thank us later. - Put me down. Who are you?\\
462 - [Herb] 'You look lovely, Lyndsey.'\\
463 - What the hell is going on?\\
464 - I swear I had nothing to do with this.\\
465 - Why did they just take my date away?\\
466 - Don't worry, I think they're just trying to help.\\
467 - Help with what?\\
468 - Okay, I-I know this seems crazy\\
469 - but I've been doing a lot of thinking and... here.\\
470 - What's this?\\
471 - A key to the house. I want you to have it.\\
472 - Really?\\
473 - Yes, yes, you're my girlfriend.\\
474 - Mi casa es su casa.\\
475 - Actually, mi casa es Walden's casa es su casa.\\
476 - I think I went to high school with a Sue Casa.\\
477 - Which is ironic, because she ended up homeless.\\
478 - Sorry. Anyway, the point is, the key is yours.\\
479 - What made you change your mind?\\
480 - I love you, Lyndsey.\\
481 - What really made you change your mind?\\
482 - Alright, here we go.\\
483 - The fact that while you could certainly do better\\
484 - there's no way I ever could.\\
485 - Alan, that is so sweet.\\
486 - And so true.\\
487 - So I know Herb and Walden\\
488 - but who's the lesbian in the bathrobe?\\
489 -     Men       \\
490 - Sorry about kidnapping you.\\
491 - Ah, don't worry about it.\\
492 - It was never gonna work with Lyndsey and me.\\
493 - Outside of her vagina, we have nothing in common.\\
494 - Doctor to doctor, can I ask you a medical question?\\
495 - Is it beautiful?\\
496 - Herb.\\
497 - Sorry about that, Dr. Staven.\\
498 - Oh, please, call me Steven.\\
499 - Well, Steven Staven?\\
500 - It's made me a stronger person.\\
501 - You know, you wear that robe better than Judith ever did.\\
502 - Really? I feel boxy.\\
503 - No, no.\\
504 - [dog barking]\\
505 - What was that?\\
506 - [growling]\\
507 - [Walden] 'Uh-oh.'\\
508 - - Oh, crap. - Run, Steven Staven! Run!\\
509 - Oh! Wait!\\
510 - - Herb's down! - Leave him!\\
511 - [Herb] 'Oh, dear God, help me!'\\

2 - [computer plays ringtone]\\
3 - - Hey, buddy. - 'Hey, dad.'\\
4 - Long time no talk. I was starting to think\\
5 - maybe you weren't a part of this family anymore.\\
6 - 'What? I'm not that easy to get rid of.'\\
7 - 'Just been really busy lately, you know'\\
8 - 'spending a lot of time with my girlfriend.'\\
9 - Oh, please, tell me it's not the 35-year-old single mother\\
10 - with the two kids.\\
11 - 'No. Tammy's 36, and she has three kids.'\\
12 - Jake, she's almost twice your age.\\
13 - 'No, she's not. I'm 19.'\\
14 - 'Geez, do the math.'\\
15 - How well do you even know this woman?\\
16 - 'Enough to know that I love her.'\\
17 - Jake, slow down. I'm just not sure\\
18 - that you know what you're getting into.\\
19 - 'You always do this.'\\
20 - 'You think every decision I make is wrong.'\\
21 - You're wrong about that.\\
22 - 'You've already made up your mind about Tammy'\\
23 - 'and you don't even know her. Let me ask you this question.'\\
24 - 'If you've never tasted a strawberry ice cream cone'\\
25 - 'in your life, how do you know what it tastes like?'\\
26 - What?\\
27 - 'My point is, you've never licked Tammy.'\\
28 - I don't know how to respond to that.\\
29 - 'Yeah, you don't. She's delicious.'\\
30 - Fine, why don't you bring her up here, so I can meet her?\\
31 - - 'Okay, I will.' - Good.\\
32 - - 'I've got leave next weekend.' - You know where I live.\\
33 - 'Yeah, someone else's house.'\\
34 - He's a dull blade, but he cuts deep.\\

46 -     Men       \\
47 - Well, I've got Jake's room all ready for this weekend.\\
48 - You know, just out of curiosity\\
49 - when are we going to stop calling it "Jake's room?"\\
50 - 'Cause I'd really like it to be referred to as\\
51 - "Walden's gym" or "Walden's home theater"\\
52 - or "Walden's room to do whatever the hell he wants with it."\\
53 - Look, I don't mean to split hairs\\
54 - but a room can't really be both a gym and a home theater.\\
55 - That's why I also need "Alan's room."\\
56 - Touche.\\
57 - [chuckling] Truthe.\\
58 - Will you stop futzing with my desk?\\
59 - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm just..\\
60 - I'm nervous about meeting Jake's girlfriend.\\
61 - I mean, he's obsessed with this woman.\\
62 - It's like he's been brainwashed by some cult.\\
63 - What guy hasn't?\\
64 - I'm sorry, you said "cult."\\
65 - You're enjoying this, aren't you?\\
66 - Yep, I got to get something out of you living here.\\
67 - You don't pay rent.\\
68 - Listen, I think you're getting all worked up over nothing.\\
69 - Nothing? She's 36 years old.\\
70 - So? I'm 34.\\
71 - Yeah, and I don't want you dating my son either.\\
72 - Ouch.\\
73 - [doorbell ringing]\\
74 - - That's probably them. - It can't be.\\
75 - Jake wouldn't ring the bell.\\
76 - [doorbell ringing]\\
77 - [doorbell continues ringing]\\
78 - Um, h-hello?\\
79 - Uh, hey, Dad. Uh, this is my girlfriend, Tammy.\\
80 - Uh, Tammy, this is my dad, Alan.\\
81 - It's a pleasure to meet you.\\
82 - - Likewise. Come in. - Wow!\\
83 - [laughing] It would take the jaws of life to get me out of this house.\\
84 - Look, you already have something in common.\\
85 - I'm, uh, Walden Schmidt.\\
86 - Good God, you're prettier than I am.\\
87 - That's quite the grip.\\
88 - Yeah. I milked cows when I was a kid.\\
89 - Then I discovered boys.\\
90 - I'm just kidding.\\
91 - Not really.\\
92 - This really is an amazing house though.\\
93 - Thank you. Be much nicer with a home theater..\\
94 - ...but, uh, I've been very fortunate.\\
95 - Yeah, so I've heard.\\
96 - Jake tells me you're stupid rich.\\
97 - He tells me you're very resourceful.\\
98 - I'll take that as a compliment.\\
99 - Please, make yourselves at home. Have a seat.\\
100 - Is there anything I can get you to eat or drink?\\
101 - Oh, I'd love a drink\\
102 - but it would set off my ankle bracelet.\\
103 - Not really.\\
104 - I got that sucker off a week ago.\\
105 - You hear that, Walden?\\
106 - She just got her ankle bracelet off.\\
107 - I don't see how this could get any better.\\
108 - Oh, oh, oh!\\
109 - It just got better!\\
110 - Well, look at you.\\
111 - Uh, now, where would a skull be going\\
112 - that he would even need a top hat?\\
113 - Oh, he might be going to visit Yosemite Sam.\\
114 - Mm.\\
115 - Yeah, they're kind of my business cards.\\
116 - I own a tattoo parlor.\\
117 - Oh, did you hear that, Walden? She owns a tattoo parlor.\\
118 - That sounds fun.\\
119 - Yeah, it's called Tammy's Tatties.\\
120 - It makes guys think of boobs.\\
121 - Thank you.\\
122 - Speaking of which, in case you forget\\
123 - my name's written right here.\\
124 - Nice!\\
125 - What's the other one called?\\
126 - [laughing]\\
127 - I like you.\\
128 - I like you too.\\
129 - [chuckling] Everybody likes everybody.\\
130 - So, so, so, how'd you two meet?\\
131 - - Oh, Jake came into my shop. - Tammy's Tatties.\\
132 - Exactly. See, once you get it in your head, you can't get it out.\\
133 - No, you cannot.\\
134 - Yeah, a couple of us guys from the base went out drinking\\
135 - and they bet me 100 bucks that I wouldn't get this tattoo\\
136 - of two arms coming out of my butt crack.\\
137 - Like, you know, someone was trying to escape.\\
138 - - Oh, Jake, you didn't. - No, Tammy wouldn't let me.\\
139 - - Damn right. - Thank you for that.\\
140 - I took one look at his ass and I thought\\
141 - I don't want to tattoo that, I want to bite that.\\
142 - Chomp.\\
143 -     Men       \\
144 - - Hey, what's going on? - Jake made pizza bagels.\\
145 - I make them for Tammy's kids all the time.\\
146 - Is it breakfast? Is it lunch?\\
147 - Is it pizza? Is it a bagel?\\
148 - I'll tell you what it is, it's delightful.\\
149 - So, uh, how does that work exactly?\\
150 - Is, uh, Tammy's ex in the picture?\\
151 - He's in some. And in some, his head's been torn off.\\
152 - But was I right or what? Isn't Tammy awesome?\\
153 - She seems great, but, still, you have to acknowledge\\
154 - that this is an unusual relationship.\\
155 - I mean she's old enough to have you as her kid.\\
156 - So what? You are too.\\
157 - He's got a point.\\
158 - Doesn't make any sense, but it's a point.\\
159 - I just want to be sure you know what you're doing.\\
160 - That's the beauty of it.\\
161 - When I don't know what I'm doing, she shows me.\\
162 - Two-zero, Jake.\\
163 - Face it, dad, I'm not a kid anymore.\\
164 - Oh, baby, you got a milk moustache.\\
165 - [chuckling] You ready to go?\\
166 - - Yep. - Where you guys heading?\\
167 - Oh, we're gonna do a little shopping\\
168 - pick up some souvenirs for my kids\\
169 - and pick up a new nipple gun.\\
170 - - N-Nipple gun? - Yeah, for piercing.\\
171 - You give me a body part, I can paint it, pierce it or plug it.\\
172 - I really like her.\\
173 - Good, 'cause I want to pick your brain, Mr. Moneybags.\\
174 - Go ahead.\\
175 - Well, I'm looking for a stable investment for my pension plan.\\
176 - Do you think Google's business model is sustainable\\
177 - over a 20-year period?\\
178 - Tell you what, while you're out, I'll google it.\\
179 - [laughing] You're funny.\\
180 - - Come on, babe. - Alright. See you, guys.\\
181 - - This makes no sense. - What are you talking about?\\
182 - She's beautiful, she's cool, she's smart.\\
183 - Exactly. What the hell is she doing with Jake?\\
184 - Besides doing him?\\
185 - - You're not helping. - I'm not trying to.\\
186 -     Men       \\
187 - Wow.\\
188 - You ever get tired of this view?\\
189 - I do not.\\
190 - I've worked hard for it.\\
191 - Good one.\\
192 - - Can I ask you a question? - Sure.\\
193 - What do you hate about me the most?\\
194 - No, I don't, I don't hate anything about you.\\
195 - Oh, please.\\
196 - I've been in your shoes.\\
197 - My 17-year-old daughter brought home a 32-year-old guy\\
198 - and I chased that son of a bitch\\
199 - right out of the house with a gun.\\
200 - Oh, my God.\\
201 - Well, it was a nipple gun.\\
202 - Which explains why I needed a new one\\
203 - and also why I was wearing an ankle bracelet.\\
204 - The point is, I get what people think about me.\\
205 - And they're only looking at the surface.\\
206 - Well, there's a lot to look at.\\
207 - Look, here's all you need to know about me.\\
208 - I'm raising three kids by myself\\
209 - I run a successful business, and I own a three-bedroom house\\
210 - that's not on wheels.\\
211 - So anybody who judges me, can kiss my ass\\
212 - right on my tattoo of Brad Paisley.\\
213 - I-I'm not judging you.\\
214 - I just, I-I don't understand why you're with Jake.\\
215 - I'm with him because I care about him.\\
216 - I mean he's sweet and kind and funny.\\
217 - And I don't know when the last time you had sex\\
218 - with a 19-year-old boy was, but it is a lot of fun.\\
219 - Then eight minutes later, it's a lot of fun again.\\
220 - Um, I'll-I'll take your word for it.\\
221 - Alan, has anybody ever looked at you\\
222 - like you were the greatest thing on the planet?\\
223 - Do strippers count?\\
224 - - No. - Then no.\\
225 - Well, that's the way Jake looks at me.\\
226 - He thinks I can do no wrong\\
227 - and he worships the ground I walk on.\\
228 - Uh, to be fair, for a while, he worshipped Twinkies.\\
229 - [laughing] Yeah. Yeah, he still does.\\
230 - But don't worry, I don't let him have sugar past 9:00.\\
231 - Mm.\\
232 - The bottom line is, I think your son is terrific.\\
233 - And I know what we have isn't gonna last forever\\
234 - but it's what I want in my life right now.\\
235 - I'm really sorry if you don't approve.\\
236 - Well, you have to understand\\
237 - Jake is still my..\\
238 - ...baby.\\
239 - I hear you.\\
240 - It's exactly what I told the judge\\
241 - when he wanted to try my oldest son as an adult.\\
242 - They're always your babies.\\
243 -     Men       \\
244 - - Hey. - Hey.\\
245 - You busy?\\
246 - I'm thinking about getting a tattoo.\\
247 - How about this?\\
248 - It's just a bunch of ones and zeroes.\\
249 - Yeah, it's my favorite Gandhi quote in binary code.\\
250 - "You can never imprison my mind."\\
251 - Why don't you just get one that says\\
252 - "I'm a nerd, don't sleep with me"?\\
253 - Did you want something?\\
254 - Yeah, I was wondering if you know\\
255 - why my dad's being such a jerk.\\
256 - Oh, dads worry. It's their job.\\
257 - I'm practically a dad\\
258 - and I don't act like that toward my children.\\
259 - That's because you respect your elders.\\
260 - Look, your dad just doesn't want to see you get hurt.\\
261 - - How am I gonna get hurt? - Are you kidding me?\\
262 - Have you never seen a movie or heard a song or read a poem?\\
263 - Uh, yes, yes, and no.\\
264 - Okay, listen, I think your dad just needs a little time\\
265 - to get used to the idea of you and Tammy being together.\\
266 - Yeah, well, he'd better hurry\\
267 - 'cause tomorrow we're gonna go to Vegas and get married.\\
268 - That should be plenty of time.\\
269 -     Men       \\
270 -     Men       \\
271 - Oh, you can't be serious.\\
272 - Are-are you really getting married?\\
273 - Yeah, I mean, assuming Tammy says "Yes."\\
274 - Oh, okay, you haven't thought this through at all.\\
275 - No, I totally have.\\
276 - I've even started on our vows. Here.\\
277 - "I can't wait to start our life together.\\
278 - "I like it when you dress in leather.\\
279 - "I'll love you forever and a day\\
280 - "you make me glad I'm not gay."\\
281 - And you said you've never read poetry.\\
282 - Alright, here, listen.\\
283 - You're too young to get married.\\
284 - - You got married at my age. - Yeah, and look what happened.\\
285 - I lost my wife and half my money\\
286 - and the only thing I gained was your father.\\
287 - I'm not going to argue about this with you.\\
288 - Just don't say anything to my dad, alright?\\
289 - You can't do this to me. I hate keeping secrets.\\
290 - Don't worry, I'll tell him when the time is right.\\
291 - When? After you get married?\\
292 - - That's a good idea. - No!\\
293 - No, you-you need to tell him before.\\
294 - That's not going to happen\\
295 - and you're not going to tell him either.\\
296 - Okay, look, your dad is my best friend\\
297 - and you're putting me in a very difficult position.\\
298 - Hey, Tammy put me in a difficult position\\
299 - the other night too, and it worked out great.\\
300 - Hey, why don't you just tell your father?\\
301 - 'Cause he'll just say it's a bad idea.\\
302 - You know why? 'Cause it's a bad idea!\\
303 - Jake, get back here!\\
304 - Do not do this to me!\\
305 - I just want a home theater.\\
306 -     Men       \\
307 - [knocking on door]\\
308 - Hey, dinner's almost ready.\\
309 - I'm gonna pass.\\
310 - What? You can't.\\
311 - Jake's making gnocchi.\\
312 - He's into cooking things he can't spell.\\
313 - What's for dessert, cake?\\
314 - Pie.\\
315 - - Come on, join us. - No, it's-it's a family thing.\\
316 - I don't want to get in the middle of it.\\
317 - Oh, oh, there's, there's nothing to get in the middle of.\\
318 - I, uh, I had a nice conversation with Tammy\\
319 - and she knows this thing with Jake isn't serious.\\
320 - - Does Jake know that? - Well, I assume he does.\\
321 - Why? Did he say something to you?\\
322 - [chuckling] Did he say something?\\
323 - Why would he say something to me? I..\\
324 - Let's go eat.\\
325 - I-I thought you didn't want to eat.\\
326 - I changed my mind, just like you did.\\
327 - You didn't like Tammy, now you do.\\
328 - Who knows what's going to happen next? Not me.\\
329 - Oh.\\
330 - Quarters.\\
331 - He's a billionaire, he's not going to miss it.\\
332 -     Men       \\
333 - Jake, this gnocchi is amazing.\\
334 - Yeah, I like to make it 'cause it sounds like nookie.\\
335 - Get it?\\
336 - I do.\\
337 - Not as much as I do.\\
338 - [both laughing]\\
339 - So, uh, Tammy, where did you learn the art of tattooing?\\
340 - Prison.\\
341 - I'm kidding. Juvie.\\
342 - - Kidding? - Nope.\\
343 - Jakey, you haven't even touched your asparagus.\\
344 - - I don't like asparagus. - Then why'd you make it?\\
345 - 'Cause you like it.\\
346 - Don't try to butter me up, young man.\\
347 - - Eat your vegetables. - I don't wanna.\\
348 - Jake, listen to your ma..\\
349 - ...arvelous girlfriend.\\
350 - Look, just take a few tiny bites.\\
351 - - 'Do I have to?' - 'It's delicious.'\\
352 - Yeah, it really is. Did you know that the asparagus plant\\
353 - uh, dates back to ancient..\\
354 - Jake's taking Tammy to Vegas to get married!\\
355 - Rome.\\
356 - What the hell, dude?\\
357 - I told you I'm not good with secrets.\\
358 - - Baby, you want to get married? - Uh, no, no, no, he doesn't.\\
359 - Yes, he does.\\
360 - I can't wait for our life together.\\
361 - I like it when you dress in le--\\
362 - No-nobody's getting married.\\
363 - We are, 'cause we love each other, right?\\
364 - Damn right we do.\\
365 - I thought you were just using him for his body!\\
366 - You said that? You're so sweet.\\
367 - 'N-n-n-no!'\\
368 - I am not going to let you throw your life away like this!\\
369 - Wait, which one of us are you talking to?\\
370 - My son, the idiot.\\
371 - Oh, so, because he wants to marry me, he's an idiot?\\
372 - Uh, to be fair, he was an idiot long before he met you.\\
373 - I don't need you to defend me.\\
374 - Come on, Tammy, let's get out of here.\\
375 - Oh, Jake, you can't possibly be this stupid.\\
376 - You know, it doesn't matter what you think of me.\\
377 - But why the hell do you have such a low opinion of your son?\\
378 - Because I know him!\\
379 - Could be worse.\\
380 - He could be one of those showbiz kids\\
381 - who goes off the rails.\\
382 -     Men       \\
383 - Alright, there's a 24-hour chapel in Vegas.\\
384 - If we hurry, we can get there before it closes.\\
385 - Yeah, I don't think we should go to Vegas.\\
386 - Why not?\\
387 - A wedding's supposed to be about bringing\\
388 - a family together, not breaking it apart.\\
389 - Hang on a sec.\\
390 - You were just as mad at my dad as I was\\
391 - and now you're on his side?\\
392 - I'm not choosing sides.\\
393 - Your dad's a tool with a bad haircut.\\
394 - But I'm just saying, if we were to get married\\
395 - I would want the whole family there.\\
396 - My kids, your dad, the guy your dad sponges off of.\\
397 - Yeah, well, I don't want him there.\\
398 - You know, Jake, you're lucky you have a dad.\\
399 - When I was five, mine went out for a sandwich\\
400 - and never came back.\\
401 - What kind of sandwich?\\
402 - What?\\
403 - Sorry, we left in the middle of dinner.\\
404 - I'm still kind of hungry.\\
405 - Look, the point is, I don't want to be the cause\\
406 - of an estrangement between you and your father.\\
407 - Don't worry, my dad was pretty estrange before he met you.\\
408 - Okay, look, let's approach this from a different angle.\\
409 - Sit.\\
410 - I think before we do anything else\\
411 - you need to make things right with your dad.\\
412 - I think he needs to make things right with me.\\
413 - It doesn't matter who takes the first step.\\
414 - Jake, he loves you\\
415 - and that's not something you can just throw away.\\
416 - You're more important to me than he is.\\
417 - Thank you.\\
418 - But family is the most important thing in the world.\\
419 - That's why I make sure my kids get to see their dad\\
420 - even if he is behind Plexiglas\\
421 - wearing an orange jumpsuit.\\
422 - I can't believe I'm not going to be there\\
423 - to see my only son get married.\\
424 - Well, if it makes you feel any better\\
425 - I'm pretty sure you'll have many more opportunities.\\
426 - I got married in Vegas\\
427 - and divorced in Reno.\\
428 - Hell of a weekend.\\
429 - Dad, I got to talk to you.\\
430 - Yeah, yeah, I-I need to talk to you too.\\
431 - Um, I want to tell you both that I'm sorry..\\
432 - ...um, that..\\
433 - ...if marrying Tammy is the right thing for you..\\
434 - ...you have my love and support.\\

439 - W-what made you change your mind?\\
440 - I just decided that I don't want to get married\\
441 - unless you're going to be the one to walk me down the aisle.\\
442 - A-Actually the dad walks the, uh..\\

445 - Thanks, and, you know, someday we are going to get married\\

456 - for when Tammy and I have our first kid.\\
457 - [laughing]\\
458 - You're enjoying this, aren't you?\\
459 - Yep.\\
460 - Although I-I am a little worried about a third generation\\
461 - of freeloaders living here.\\
462 - If it's a boy, what do you think about Walden Harper?\\
463 - - I like it. - No.\\
464 - Alright, then I guess it's down to either\\
465 - Alan or Xiang Xao.\\
466 - Xiang Xao?\\
467 - Yeah, I've got to be ready, Dad.\\

2 - - 'Morning. - 'Morning.\\
3 - You, by chance, have the number of a good chiropractor?\\
4 - What about Alan?\\
5 - [laughing]\\
6 - Sorry. I couldn't resist.\\
7 - What, is your back out?\\
8 - Not yet, but I got a big date for Valentine's Day.\\
9 - And if everything goes well, I'll need a chiropractor\\
10 - a psychiatrist and a priest.\\
11 - I can't wait for this stupid holiday to be over\\
12 - so we can celebrate something cool, like..\\
13 - ...Free Bobblehead at Dodger Stadium Day.\\
14 - - What are you talking about? - Valentine's Day.\\
15 - Or what it should really be called\\
16 - Dumb Greeting Card, Chocolate Covered\\
17 - Overpriced Flowers, Can't Get a Dinner Reservation\\
18 - I'm Probably Going To Die Alone Anyway Day.\\
19 - Sounds like Cupid's arrow hit somebody\\
20 - right in the the bile sack.\\
21 - Don't get my started on that fat, flying baby.\\
22 - What could you possibly have against Cupid?\\
23 - First of all, he's wearing a diaper.\\
24 - Yeah, that's sexy.\\
25 - And then he's got wings, which make you think of angels\\
26 - which makes you think of God, which makes you feel guilty\\
27 - about having sex in the first place.\\
28 - And in the second place.\\
29 - Well, I for one, am going all out for Lyndsey this year.\\
30 - Really? What's that mean?\\
31 - Cemetery flowers and a coupon\\
32 - for one free go-around on Mr. Alan's Wild Ride?\\
33 - I am sparing no expense. Lyndsey deserves the best\\
34 - and I am finally going to give it to her.\\
35 - If you're giving it to her, it's not gonna be the best.\\
36 - [phone beeping]\\
37 - - Wow. - What?\\
38 - I just got an e-mail from Kate.\\
39 - She's in town. She wants to see me.\\
40 - - Did she say why? - No.\\
41 - Could be anything.\\
42 - It could be nothing.\\
43 - Could be something.\\
44 - Could be something serious. What if she's dying?\\
45 - What if she's pregnant?\\
46 - Wait, what if she's dying to be pregnant?\\
47 - The woman I love wants to have my child.\\
48 - Oh, my God, I'm gonna be a father.\\
49 - Advantage fat, flying baby.\\
50 - You have the number of a good chiropractor?\\
51 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\

53 -     Men       \\
54 - - Kate. - Sam.\\
55 - - Oh. It's.. - I'm kidding.\\
56 - - Oh. - Hi, Walden.\\
57 - Hi.\\
58 - - Hi. - Hi.\\
59 - I, uh, I got you your favorite coffee.\\
60 - Hey, how'd you remember?\\
61 - Please, how hard is it to remember\\
62 - a Grande, extra hot, decaf, triple shot, five pump\\
63 - vanilla, nonfat, no foam, whip cream, caramel macchiato?\\
64 - Actually, I switched to tea.\\
65 - - Oh. - It's a joke.\\
66 - Well, you look great.\\
67 - Success is really working for you.\\
68 - Then again, you'd look great with a bag over your head.\\
69 - That didn't come off as charming as I wanted it to.\\
70 - Thank you.\\
71 - I can't believe how lucky I've been.\\
72 - Lucky? Come on, you have real talent.\\
73 - I-I actually bought one of your dresses off your website.\\
74 - Seriously?\\
75 - Yeah, I haven't had a chance to wear it yet.\\
76 - I've been waiting for the perfect occasion.\\
77 - I was really surprised that you called me.\\
78 - Yeah, I'm actually in town for a couple of days\\
79 - on business, and I wanted to see you.\\
80 - You did?\\
81 - Me too. I mean other than stalking you on Facebook.\\
82 - Well, I wanted to give you this.\\
83 - It's the money you invested in me.\\
84 - Oh, Kate.\\
85 - I gave this to my girlfriend\\
86 - so she could follow her dreams.\\
87 - And I'm paying back my investor, so I don't owe him anything.\\
88 - S-so this is why you wanted to see me.\\
89 - Walden, we broke up.\\
90 - When you break up, you give the other person their stuff back.\\
91 - Yes, but it's usually a cellphone charger\\
92 - and a bite guard.\\
93 - Well, in this case, it's $100,000.\\
94 - Well, I don't want it, but I do want my bite guard back.\\
95 - Buy another one. Or thousand of them.\\
96 - Kate, just put the money into your business.\\
97 - It'll help you get to the next level.\\
98 - I don't need it.\\
99 - I've actually found a new investor.\\
100 - That's how I'm able to pay you back.\\
101 - So, we're no longer business partners.\\
102 - - We are not. - Well, that's great.\\
103 - That frees us up to be two young\\
104 - crazy dreamers in love.\\
105 - No.\\
106 - Okay, how about two cautiously\\
107 - optimistic adults sharing dinner?\\
108 - I don't think that's a good idea.\\
109 - Give me one more run at this.\\
110 - Two old friends, chance encounter, bus stop\\
111 - sharing a bag of tacos.\\
112 - Not gonna happen.\\
113 - Too bad.\\
114 - I was really looking for an excuse to wear my new dress.\\
115 -     Men       \\
116 - Hi. Um, I am interested in doing something special\\
117 - for my best gal on Valentine's Day.\\
118 - Uh, how much is your Presidential Suite?\\
119 - Uh-huh, I-I see.\\
120 - Um, do you, by any chance\\
121 - have a Secretary of Agriculture Suite?\\
122 - Alright, alright, you know what, let me just book\\
123 - your best regular-people room, and, uh..\\
124 - ...would it be possible to, uh, split the deposit\\
125 - over three credit cards?\\
126 - Oh, oh, sure, I'll hold.\\
127 - Oh, oh, hey, how'd it go with Kate?\\
128 - Let's just say she doesn't want me in her business.\\
129 - Financial or lady.\\
130 - Oh, oh, I'm sorry.\\
131 - Yeah, the only reason she wanted to see me\\
132 - was to give me this stupid check for $100,000.\\
133 - You're not stupid to me.\\
134 - So, uh, what's the next step?\\
135 - There is no next step.\\
136 - - It's over. - What are you talking about?\\
137 - She doesn't want anything to do with me.\\
138 - Well, there's a good attitude.\\
139 - Uh, let me ask you something.\\
140 - Was it over for Lyndsey and me\\
141 - when I burned her house to the ground?\\
142 - No. Was it over for us\\
143 - when I introduced her mom to my mom\\
144 - who subsequently turned her into a rapacious lesbian? No.\\
145 - And-and-and what about me living in this house?\\
146 - Was it over when my brother died and you bought the place?\\
147 - Sadly, no.\\
148 - Right, because I am not a quitter.\\
149 - And you aren't, either.\\
150 - You're Walden Schmidt, captain of industry.\\
151 - Titan of technology. Head honcho of..\\
152 - ...handsomeness.\\
153 - - Ran out of steam? - Yes.\\
154 - But you'll notice, I did not quit.\\
155 - - Maybe you're right. - Of course I'm right.\\
156 - Nothing is over until you say it's over.\\
157 - With the possible exception of me moving out\\
158 - which will only happen when you wheel me\\
159 - into the assisted living facility.\\
160 - You're right.\\
161 - I'm gonna go talk to her. Thank you, Alan.\\
162 - No problem, buddy. I will always be here for you.\\
163 - Literally.\\
164 - Oh, uh, hello. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
165 - Um, I have a MasterCard\\
166 - a Discover card and my mom's Visa.\\
167 -     Men       \\
168 - - Walden. - Great.\\
169 - You've already showered, now get dressed. We're going to dinner.\\
170 - What? No.\\
171 - Brrr. Sorry, wrong answer.\\
172 - The head honcho of handsomeness\\
173 - rejects your rejection.\\
174 - Is that a title you gave yourself?\\
175 - No, it was given to me by the man I live with.\\
176 - How did you find my room?\\
177 - - Told me at the front desk. - They're not supposed to.\\
178 - They're also not supposed to accept bribes, but here I am.\\
179 - I am not going to dinner with you.\\
180 - Fine.\\
181 - You don't want to go to dinner with me, then..\\
182 - ...then we will have dinner right here.\\
183 - Look, your favorite, a half-eaten lobster\\
184 - with a cigarette butt in it.\\
185 - Oh, I was really hoping for coleslaw\\
186 - with a Band-Aid in it.\\
187 - Come on, Kate, go to dinner with him.\\
188 - Don't be so shellfish.\\
189 - You know you're an idiot, right?\\
190 - I'm a persistent idiot.\\
191 - Let me get dressed.\\
192 - Yay.\\
193 - Why would I do that?\\
194 -     Men       \\
195 - Oh, hey, there's my valentine.\\
196 - Will you be mine?\\
197 - 'Hi, Alan. Yes, I will.'\\
198 - Great, 'cause I got something special planned.\\
199 - 'Is this gonna be another scavenger hunt'\\
200 - 'that ends in your pants?'\\
201 - No, no, this year, I booked us a room at the Bel-Air Hotel\\
202 - with the full romance package.\\
203 - 'Oh, my God, are you serious?'\\
204 - Oh, yeah, uh, candlelight dinner, dancing\\
205 - couples massage, followed by savage sex\\
206 - with the man of your dreams.\\
207 - 'Steve Buscemi's gonna be there?'\\
208 - 'That sounds amazing.'\\
209 - 'But how can you afford it?'\\
210 - Ah, bup, bup, bup. Nothing is too good for milady.\\
211 - Besides, a month without antidepressants\\
212 - isn't gonna kill me.\\
213 - 'I don't know what to say.'\\
214 - Oh, you don't have to say anything.\\
215 - Just pack your bag\\
216 - and your chariot will arrive at 6:00.\\
217 - 'Yeah, would it be okay if we took my chariot?'\\
218 - - Why? - 'Really.'\\
219 - 'I have to say it out loud?'\\
220 - 'I don't want to pull up to the Bel-Air Hotel'\\
221 - 'in your piece-of-crap car.'\\
222 - Oh, oh, uh, we can use your car.\\
223 - Oh, and if the front desk refers to you as Evelyn Harper\\
224 - just roll with it.\\
225 - - 'Okay.' - Well, I love you.\\
226 - 'I love you too.'\\
227 - Well. That went well.\\
228 - I won't be needing these clues for the scavenger hunt.\\
229 -     Men       \\
230 - Wasn't that better than sitting in your room\\
231 - all alone watching porn?\\
232 - - Is that what you do? - What, me? No.\\
233 - I'm a Bible guy.\\
234 - Well, thanks.\\
235 - I had a really nice time.\\
236 - Me too.\\
237 - Well, goodnight.\\
238 - Uh, but..\\
239 - - Goodnight? - Yeah.\\
240 - Oh, I was hoping that maybe we could..\\
241 - ...you know, have hotel fun.\\
242 - I don't sleep with guys on the first date.\\
243 - First date? We lived together.\\
244 - No, I lived with Sam Wilson.\\
245 - Who you bare an uncanny resemblance to, but..\\
246 - ...still, I think we should take it slow.\\
247 - Okay, I get it.\\
248 - Goodnight.\\
249 - - Kate? - 'What do you want, Walden?'\\
250 - Oh, uh, it's not Walden, it's Sam Wilson.\\
251 - 'Go away.'\\
252 - Eh, it was worth a shot.\\
253 -     Men       \\
254 -     Men       \\
255 - 'Morning.\\
256 - Oh, there he is.\\
257 - Come here.\\
258 - - 'What?' - Just come here.\\
259 - - Ah. - Oh!\\
260 - Oh, what a lovely way to start the day.\\
261 - Don't kiss me, I have morning breath.\\
262 - - Thank you. - You're welcome.\\
263 - - What did I do? - You were right.\\
264 - Kate and I wound up having a great time last night.\\
265 - - Congratulations. - Yeah. It was perfect.\\
266 - I mean it was the same chemistry\\
267 - the same connection.\\
268 - Hmm, when you say connection, are we talking love connection?\\
269 - And by love connection, I mean brown chicken, brown cow.\\
270 - - No. - No?\\
271 - Nah, I didn't want to.\\
272 - You know, I just wanted to take it slow\\
273 - so we could connect on a more emotional, spiritual level.\\
274 - Huh. Sounds pretty gay to me, but alright.\\
275 - So when are you gonna see her again?\\
276 - - Tonight. - On Valentine's Day?\\
277 - - Yep. - Ooh.\\
278 - That's a terrific day not to get laid.\\
279 - - I know, right? - Oh.\\
280 - Oh, hey, can I ask your opinion about something?\\
281 - - Yeah, of course. - Great.\\
282 - What-what do you think of this?\\
283 - Whoa! Dude! What the hell?\\
284 - Oh, uh, I-I did a little manscaping\\
285 - for my, uh, my big night with Lyndsey tonight.\\
286 - I wanted to surprise her.\\
287 - Uh, does this look like a heart?\\
288 - Uh.. Yeah, it looks great. I love it.\\
289 - Uh, you're not even looking. Come on, I had your back.\\
290 - Yeah, well, I don't want to have your front.\\
291 - Please?\\
292 - Fine. But I'm going to restrict my response\\
293 - to only the nest.\\
294 - I'm not going to comment on the baby bird\\
295 - sitting on top of the eggs.\\
296 - That's all I ask.\\
297 - No.\\
298 - Doesn't look like a heart.\\
299 - What? It-it doesn't?\\
300 - No. There's no cleavage, there's no dip.\\
301 - It's just, there.\\
302 - Wait, what are you talking about?\\
303 - There's a...there's a curve right there.\\
304 - The whole thing is lopsided.\\
305 - Oh, no. It just looks that way 'cause I haven't fluffed. See?\\
306 - No, it still doesn't look like a heart.\\
307 - Fine, I'll keep working on it.\\
308 - But it is very difficult to manscape from this angle.\\
309 - - No, it's not. - Uh, yeah, it is.\\
310 - Okay, just for a frame of reference..\\
311 - ...check out my manscaping.\\
312 - Oh, my God.\\
313 - - It's beautiful. - Mm-hmm.\\
314 - [Berta] 'I knew it.'\\
315 - So that's how you pay the rent.\\
316 -     Men       \\
317 - Alan, come on, let's go.\\
318 - I want to spend every possible minute in that hotel room.\\
319 - 'One second! Just finishing off'\\
320 - 'one last Valentine's surp..'\\
321 - [Alan screaming]\\
322 - Alan?\\
323 - [gasping] Oh, my God! What happened?\\
324 - Manscaping..\\
325 - ...balls..\\
326 - ...hospital!\\
327 -     Men       \\
328 - Well, I believe we just combined Valentine's Day\\
329 - with the Fourth of July.\\
330 - What do you say we throw in Groundhog Day and do it again?\\
331 - You know..\\
332 - ...I had no intention of sleeping with you.\\
333 - I even wore my granny panties.\\
334 - Well, the joke's on you\\
335 - 'cause I like a sensible, full-coverage brief.\\
336 - I really missed you.\\
337 - Me too.\\
338 - Can I tell you a secret though?\\
339 - Sure.\\
340 - Sam Wilson is a much better lover than you.\\
341 - I'm sorry.\\
342 - I couldn't get my mind off of Alan's penis.\\
343 -     Men       \\
344 - Oh, please drive faster. I'm bleeding out of my scrotum.\\
345 - Where in the world did you get the idea\\
346 - to shave your pubic hair into a heart?\\
347 - I read about it in a magazine.\\
348 - - What magazine? - Marie Claire.\\
349 - Doesn't look much like a heart.\\
350 - Well, it's bleeding like one.\\
351 - Oh. Oh. Oh, my God. This is the end.\\
352 - - I'm seeing lights. - You're not dying.\\
353 - - We're getting pulled over. - Oh, nice job, lead foot.\\
354 - Do you want to keep your other ball?\\
355 - 'Evening, ma'am. Do you know why I pulled you over?\\
356 - I know I was speeding, but I have a very good excuse.\\
357 - - Is that so? - Show him, Alan.\\
358 - - What? No! - Show him.\\
359 - Oh!\\
360 - Oh, sweet mother of God!\\
361 - Is that a heart?\\
362 - Thank you.\\
363 -     Men       \\
364 - Oh, my God!\\
365 - Wha.. Alan, no.\\
366 - Sorry. What's.. What's going on?\\
367 - You're not going to believe this.\\
368 - My business partner just found a factory.\\
369 - We can start production on my line immediately.\\
370 - That's great. Congratulations.\\
371 - Oh, my God, this is so exciting.\\
372 - We leave for China tomorrow.\\
373 - Tomorrow?\\
374 - Oh, you know what? Wait..\\
375 - I'm gonna be in Japan in two weeks on business.\\
376 - I could hop over to China.\\
377 - We could get some kung pao chicken\\
378 - maybe adopt a baby.\\
379 - Oh! Kung pao chicken is such a commitment.\\
380 - Ah, wait.\\
381 - In two weeks, I have to be back here.\\
382 - Okay.\\
383 - Oh, how about the week of the tenth?\\
384 - I've a conference in Austin. You could come with me.\\
385 - Oh. Let me check.\\
386 - I don't know if you've ever been to a tech conference\\
387 - but picture a comic book convention with nerdier guys.\\
388 - You would be their queen.\\
389 - Ah, no, that won't work.\\
390 - Um..\\
391 - - How about first week in May? - I can do the second.\\
392 - And I can't.\\
393 - This was a lot easier when we were both broke.\\
394 - It was.\\
395 - How about this?\\
396 - Are you free for sex in 30 seconds?\\
397 - I have an opening.\\
398 - Let me check.\\
399 - Well, I'll have to move\\
400 - a few things around, but yes, I am.\\
401 -     Men       \\
402 - - Hi. - Hi.\\
403 - How you doing?\\
404 - I'm high, humiliated and hairless.\\
405 - I'm sorry I ruined Valentine's Day.\\
406 - What are you talking about?\\
407 - Well, I wanted it to be special because, you know\\
408 - I haven't always been the best boyfriend\\
409 - or even a good boyfriend.\\
410 - Or even an adequate boyfr..\\
411 - Feel free to stop me at any time.\\
412 - I'm just teasing you.\\
413 - The fact that you even tried means everything to me.\\
414 - - Really? - Really.\\
415 - And driving 95 miles an hour behind a police escort?\\
416 - Best Valentine's Day ever.\\
417 - Oh, hey, you know, uh..\\
418 - ...we could pull this curtain.\\
419 - Seriously?\\
420 - They just put 10 stitches in your junk.\\
421 - I thought we could take advantage of the swelling.\\
422 - Okay.\\
423 - - 'You ready?' - 'Ow.'\\
424 - [Alan] 'Ow, ow.'\\
425 - 'Ow! Don't-don't stop.'\\
426 - 'Ow!'\\
427 - [Alan grunting]\\
428 -     Men       \\
429 -     Men       \\
430 - I know I'm going to regret asking this, but..\\
431 - ...how's your ball?\\
432 - Throbbing and green.\\
433 - So what's going on with you and Kate?\\
434 - I don't know.\\
435 - It's going to be hard to make a relationship work\\
436 - with her traveling all around the world.\\
437 - Mmm, that's rough.\\
438 - Not tetanus shot in your sack rough, but..\\
439 - Hey, how's she affording all this?\\
440 - She's got some new investor with a lot of money.\\
441 - Oh, that's nice.\\
442 - Yeah, except I don't know if I'm ever gonna see her again.\\
443 - If you don't leave it alone, it'll never heal.\\
444 - If you don't stop doing that\\
445 - I'm gonna make you wear a cone around it.\\
446 -     Men       \\
447 - What a stroke of luck, you finding that factory in China.\\
448 - I know.\\
449 - Sometimes fate steps in and makes things happen.\\
450 - I'm not gonna lie, I wish the timing were better.\\
451 - Well, if he really loves you, he'll wait for you.\\
452 - How did you know I have a boyfriend?\\
453 - Oh, a pretty girl like you, you'd have to have a boyfriend.\\

1 -     Men       \\
2 - Hi, future me.\\
3 - This is 17-year-old you in your dorm room at MIT.\\
4 - Yeah, that's right.\\
5 - I did my own Pop Up Video.\\
6 - How cool is that?\\
7 - Still is.\\
8 - Hopefully you're watching this from your implanted brain chip\\
9 - aka the "Tran-Schmidter."\\
10 - Running proprietary software\\
11 - developed by Walden Schmidt Enterprises.\\
12 - Failing that hopefully you've at least seen a girl naked.\\
13 - Hey, what you watching?\\
14 - Check this out, I had all my old videotapes\\
15 - digitized, and I found this.\\
16 - Oh, my God, is that you?\\
17 - You were nothing more than an awkward\\
18 - pimply-faced, goofy-looking teenager.\\
19 - We would've been best friends.\\
20 - Yeah, I made it when I was at MIT.\\
21 - It outlines everything I wanted to accomplish\\
22 - by the time I turned 35.\\
23 - Oh, I did a similar thing.\\
24 - Well, it wasn't so much a video as, uh\\
25 - something I wrote on a cocktail napkin.\\
26 - "Don't kill yourself. It'll get better."\\
27 - I was so naive.\\
28 - I hope you've accomplished your first goal\\
29 - as previously stated, of seeing a girl naked.\\
30 - And I'm talking in person.\\
31 - Which I did a short 18 months later.\\
32 - 'Goal number two.'\\
33 - Create your own software company\\
34 - that revolutionizes the industry standard\\
35 - for information transferal at blinding speeds.\\
36 - [dial-up modem bings]\\
37 - Hear that?\\
38 - 56k dial-up.\\
39 - In four hours I will have downloaded\\
40 - the entire Spice Girls album.\\
41 - After building your company from the ground up\\
42 - you will sell it for..\\
43 - ...one million dollars.\\
44 - Well, that didn't happen.\\
45 - I sold it for one billion dollars.\\
46 - Yeah, baby!\\
47 - Don't.\\
48 - Just, just don't.\\
49 - Number three\\
50 - live in a beautiful beach house.\\
51 - Nailed it.\\
52 - With the love of your life.\\
53 - Nailed it.\\
54 - Although it is kinda hard to meet someone\\
55 - when you spend 20 hours a day in the computer lab.\\
56 - Phyllis is now Phil.\\
57 - He's a commercial fisherman in Baton Rouge.\\
58 - But I'm sure all this hard work will be worth it someday\\
59 - when you're watching this video with your beautiful wife\\
60 - four kids, two dogs and robot butler\\
61 - 'developed by Walden Schmidt Enterprises.'\\
62 - Hello, Walden.\\
63 - Would you like a root beer?\\
64 - Heck, yeah.\\
65 - Where did my life take such a wrong turn?\\
66 - What are you talking about?\\
67 - I don't have any of those things that matter.\\
68 - No wife, no kids.\\
69 - All I have is you.\\
70 - Well..\\
71 - ...we could adopt.\\
72 -     Men men men men manly men men men    \\
73 -     Ha aa aa        Men       \\
74 - [Walden on TV] 'Watching this video with your beautiful wife'\\
75 - 'four kids, two dogs and robot butler'\\
76 - 'developed by Walden Schmidt Enterprises.'\\
77 - Hey.\\
78 - Oh, hey.\\
79 - - What are you doing up? - Alan is sleep-sobbing again.\\
80 - You still watching this thing?\\
81 - I'm a failure, Lyndsey.\\
82 - No, you're not, Walden.\\
83 - Although you looked like one in college.\\
84 - Yeah, I kinda did.\\
85 - I mean, I wouldn't have slept with you.\\
86 - and I slept with everybody.\\
87 - Got it.\\
88 - I even slept with the janitor in my dorm.\\
89 - Is this supposed to cheer me up?\\
90 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
91 - I'm sorry.\\
92 - Look, when I was 18\\
93 - I was convinced I was gonna marry Axl Rose\\
94 - and have my own TV show.\\
95 - Well, they don't give TV shows to people\\
96 - just 'cause they're good-looking.\\
97 - You know, Walden, just 'cause your life\\
98 - didn't turn out the way you thought\\
99 - doesn't mean it's not a success.\\
100 - I mean, how many people can say they're a billionaire?\\
101 - One thousand two hundred and twenty-six.\\
102 - Seriously?\\
103 - That's a lot more than I thought.\\
104 - Do you know 'em all?\\
105 - Well, there's not a club or anything.\\
106 - But Buffett does host a poker game once a month.\\
107 - - Last time, I won Guatemala. - Wow.\\
108 - And then I lost at the end\\
109 - to the woman who invented Spanx.\\
110 - Money doesn't mean anything\\
111 - if I don't have anyone to share it with.\\
112 - Oh, I get that.\\
113 - But you're not going to meet anybody\\
114 - sitting on your couch feeling sorry for yourself.\\
115 - Are you?\\
116 - I guess not.\\
117 - Damn.\\
118 - I just don't get relationships.\\
119 - Nobody does.\\
120 - They're scary and messy.\\
121 - And sometimes you get involved\\
122 - with somebody you don't really like and..\\
123 - ...one day, you find yourself peeing on a stick.\\
124 - And the plus sign shows up and you have to give up\\
125 - your dreams of being an actress so you can raise a kid\\
126 - who can only do math when he's figuring out the cost of weed.\\
127 - Pep talks really aren't your strong suit, are they?\\
128 - I'm just saying\\
129 - things happen, but you can't give up.\\
130 - I mean, if I had stopped looking\\
131 - I never would've found my amazing, wonderful boyfriend.\\
132 - Oh, you're cheatin' on Alan?\\
133 -     Men       \\
134 - [Alan] 'Hey.'\\
135 - Uh, would you eat expired pudding?\\
136 - - No. - Oh, good.\\
137 - Then I can have it.\\
138 - Knock yourself out.\\
139 - What're you doing?\\
140 - I'm looking for this card, and I can't..\\
141 - Ah, there it is.\\
142 - "Emily's Elite and Discreet Introductions."\\
143 - Oh, fancy call girls.\\
144 - I like it.\\
145 - No, it's a dating service.\\
146 - Oh, right. "Dating service."\\
147 - Wink-wink.\\
148 - You know, I want to like you\\
149 - but sometimes you make it so hard.\\
150 - "Substantial relationships for substantial people."\\
151 - Ah, big girls.\\
152 - Get your smoosh on.\\
153 - They throw mixers for single rich people.\\
154 - I wouldn't think you'd be into that kinda thing.\\
155 - You've always been a-a fate kinda guy.\\
156 - Yeah, well, I'm gonna create my own fate. Lyndsey's right.\\
157 - I'm not gonna find anyone sitting around here\\
158 - feelin' sorry for myself.\\
159 - No, you're not.\\
160 - Are you?\\
161 - - What? - Nothing.\\
162 - Hey, uh, can I go along?\\
163 - - No, you have Lyndsey. - I'd be doing it for her.\\
164 - Look, I'll find a rich, 90 year-old woman with a bad ticker\\
165 - give her the best three minutes of her life\\
166 - and then, you know, send her out with a bang.\\
167 - Then spend my inheritance on Lyndsey.\\
168 - Or whatever's left after my grief cruise.\\
169 - Again, you make it really hard to like you.\\
170 - - I just want a sugar mama. - Yeah, you have one.\\
171 - Her name is Walden.\\
172 -     Men       \\
173 - Walden, we have a great mixer tonight.\\
174 - I hope you're ready to meet some substantial women.\\
175 - Yep, I'm ready to get my smoosh on.\\
176 - I'm sorry. I'm just really nervous.\\
177 - Don't be. Everyone here is rich and looking for love.\\
178 - The only woman in this room\\
179 - who wants you for your money is me.\\
180 - - Happy mingling. - Okay.\\
181 - Hello.\\
182 - Hello.\\
183 - - Trust fund or tech? - Excuse me?\\
184 - The way you're dressed means you're either\\
185 - the beneficiary of a trust fund or in the tech business.\\
186 - Unless you're working here in which case\\
187 - I need another drink.\\
188 - Ac-actually, I'm in tech.\\
189 - I started my own company when I was--\\
190 - What do your Fridays look like?\\
191 - Uh, a lot like my Thursdays, just one day later.\\
192 - A sense of humor.\\
193 - Some people find that attractive.\\
194 - Are you one of them?\\
195 - I love to laugh.\\
196 - Now, I've got Friday evenings\\
197 - Sunday afternoons and ski season.\\
198 - - How does that work for you? - So..\\
199 - Don't you wanna at least know my name?\\
200 - Really?\\
201 - We have to do all this?\\
202 - Alright, I'm Sylvia Miller and I'm the CEO\\
203 - of a major pharmaceutical company.\\
204 - - Wow, very impressive. - Yes.\\
205 - Every time you get an erection, you owe me ten dollars.\\
206 - See? Sense of humor. Now, Fridays and Sundays.\\
207 - I just thought maybe we could\\
208 - spend some time getting to know each--\\
209 - Nice talking to you.\\
210 - Okay, I'll put her on the "maybe" pile.\\
211 - Hi. How you doing?\\
212 - Oh, hi, I'm Walden Schmidt.\\
213 - Nice to meet you. TC Randall.\\
214 - You're the TC Randall?\\
215 - Author of, "Throgwarten Middle School Mysteries?"\\
216 - I-I've read all your books.\\
217 - Really?\\
218 - Yeah, I.. Who hasn't?\\
219 - Grown men.\\
220 - Their loss. I mean, you're-you're an amazing author.\\
221 - - Thank you. - Oh, you know.\\
222 - I do have one question, though.\\
223 - In-in book three, the dragons inexplicably\\
224 - lose their ability to breathe fire when clearly,\\
225 - in book two, the wizards gave them that ability.\\
226 - Was that a setup, for book four or an oversight?\\
227 - They're children's books.\\
228 - Well, it says on the cover\\
229 - "they're for wizards, dragon trainers and kids of all ages."\\
230 - Okay, you're right. I'm sorry.\\
231 - Um, the dragons lost their ability to breathe fire\\
232 - in the Caverns of Chaos.\\
233 - Ah, come on they didn't even go\\
234 - to the Caverns of Chaos until they solved\\
235 - the mystery of the missing map.\\
236 - Alright, you know what?\\
237 - When I wrote those books, I was addicted to painkillers.\\
238 - They make no sense, but they make me a ton of money\\
239 - so cut me some slack.\\
240 - Probably got the painkillers from the pharmaceutical chick.\\
241 - - So, any luck so far? - No, not yet.\\
242 - Oh, well, don't worry. There are plenty of women here.\\
243 - Well, how about them?\\
244 - Um, Sarah's oil money.\\
245 - Stephanie is a tobacco heiress.\\
246 - And Amy had sex with a senator and owns the video.\\
247 - - Oh, my God. - I don't care how.\\
248 - I care how much.\\
249 - Uh, no. The woman in the green dress.\\
250 - I used to be married to her.\\
251 - Oh, oh, I'm sorry.\\
252 - I-I try to avoid situations like this.\\
253 - No. You know what? It's fine. I'll..\\
254 - I'll just go say hello.\\
255 - Sure. What's the worst that can happen?\\
256 - She's already got half your money.\\
257 - Bridget?\\
258 - Walden?\\
259 - What are you doing here?\\
260 - Just...drinking a beer\\
261 - losing faith in humanity, planning to die alone.\\
262 - I get it. These people are awful.\\
263 - The last guy I talked to offered to give me a boob job.\\
264 - - A plastic surgeon? - Unfortunately, no.\\
265 - So, you haven't met anyone, either?\\
266 - No. I'm actually thinking about going next door.\\
267 - The Goldberg Bar Mitzvah seems like it's going off.\\
268 - Mmm. Well, good luck to you.\\
269 - I hope you find what you're looking for.\\
270 - So, did I find what I was looking for?\\
271 - Oh, yeah.\\
272 -     Men       \\
273 -     Men       \\
274 - - So. - Yeah.\\
275 - That happened.\\
276 - Twice.\\
277 - Three for me.\\
278 - - Oh, that's great. - Yeah.\\
279 - The third time, I thought you were screaming\\
280 - just 'cause I was on your hair.\\
281 - - Can I ask you a question? - Sure.\\
282 - What does this mean?\\
283 - It means we both paid $1000\\
284 - to meet someone we already slept with.\\
285 - Wait, you paid $1000?\\
286 - I paid $2000.\\
287 - Looks like you got screwed a lot tonight.\\
288 - The answer is..\\
289 - ...I don't know what it means.\\
290 - - I just know it feels right. - It does.\\
291 - Which is odd because we just did\\
292 - a couple things that were very, very wrong.\\
293 - So, how do we make sure we don't end up\\
294 - where we were before?\\
295 - Well, that's..\\
296 - Everything that happened before was your fault\\
297 - so it's kind of up to you.\\
298 - I'm a different person than I was when we split up.\\
299 - That's good, 'cause towards the end\\
300 - I felt more like your mother than your wife.\\
301 - Oh, you're a much better kisser than my mom.\\
302 - So are you.\\
303 - The truth is..\\
304 - ...I've grown up a lot since then.\\
305 - I don't need anyone to take care of me now.\\
306 - So I don't have to check under the bed for monsters anymore?\\
307 - No, of course not. Alan does that.\\
308 - Does Alan do this?\\
309 - Yes.\\
310 - Well..\\
311 - Uh, he does not do that.\\
312 -     Men       \\
313 - Can't believe you guys are back together.\\
314 - Walden and Bridget. Bridget and Walden.\\
315 - And Alan.\\
316 - The three musketeers.\\
317 - - Or three's a crowd. - Or three's company.\\
318 - Or three strikes and you're out.\\
319 - Okay, okay. Just play nice.\\
320 - Sorry.\\
321 - So, uh, Bridget, uh..\\
322 - ...after you and Walden broke up\\
323 - didn't you immediately start dating his best friend\\
324 - and business partner, Billy?\\
325 - I did, but in hindsight, I realize\\
326 - it was just a pathetic attempt to stay close to Walden.\\
327 - You know what that's like, don't you, Alan?\\
328 - Alright, that was a good one.\\
329 - What are you eating?\\
330 - Oh, it's a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich\\
331 - with pancakes as the bread.\\
332 - I call it a McWalden.\\
333 - I call it a McBypass.\\
334 - It has all the basic food groups\\
335 - protein, dairy...syrup.\\
336 - If you don't eat properly\\
337 - your immune system can't do its job.\\
338 - - I've had more colds this year. - See?\\
339 - I'm gonna pour you a glass of\\
340 - fresh orange juice to wash that down.\\
341 - - She's doing it again. - What?\\
342 - Telling you what to do.\\
343 - She just cares about me.\\
344 - - Meow! Whoopish! - Shut up.\\
345 - Here you go.\\
346 - Okay, I think you're all done with that.\\
347 - - Actually, I was not-- - Drink your juice.\\
348 - When you're done I want you to go upstairs and make your bed.\\
349 - - But Berta does it. - No buts.\\
350 - Okay.\\
351 - Run!\\
352 -     Men       \\
353 - I'm so...glad that we found each other again.\\
354 - Me, too.\\
355 - - I wanna try something. - Whatever it is, I am in.\\
356 - - It's pretty extreme. - Yay!\\
357 - Are you ready to have your mind blown?\\
358 - Among other things.\\
359 - Let's...wait.\\
360 - For what?\\
361 - Let's not have sex tonight.\\
362 - Let's wait.\\
363 - I'm not sure that I follow.\\
364 - Imagine how much deeper we could connect\\
365 - on an emotional level if we weren't prisoners of our pelvis.\\
366 - But I like that prison.\\
367 - I just-I just don't want to be in solitary.\\
368 - I'm serious, Walden.\\
369 - I want sex to be more than just a physical release.\\
370 - I want it to be a special event.\\
371 - Okay, are we talking special event like..\\
372 - ...Monday Night Football?\\
373 - Or special event like Halley's Comet?\\
374 - I'll let you know.\\
375 - But in the meantime, there's other stuff we could do.\\
376 - Oh, I like other stuff.\\
377 - - What do you have in mind? - We can cuddle.\\
378 - Cuddle?\\
379 - I think it would really help us connect.\\
380 - Let's try it.\\
381 - See? Isn't this nice?\\
382 - Mmm, mmm.\\
383 - This is so much better than having nasty old sex.\\
384 - So, how do we know when we're done?\\
385 -     Men       \\
386 - There you are, Alan.\\
387 - Come. Join us, please.\\
388 - Oh, this can't be good.\\
389 - So, uh...what's goin' on?\\
390 - Walden.\\
391 - Um...first, I would like to say\\
392 - that I appreciate what a great friend you are.\\
393 - Thank you?\\
394 - Uh, which makes it hard for me..\\
395 - Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.\\
396 - - Bridget feels that-- - Ahem!\\
397 - We feel... that you living here\\
398 - is no longer beneficial to the goals of this household.\\
399 - Buh-bye.\\
400 - Fine, fine. Let me just say one thing.\\
401 - Okay, when you guys broke up the first time\\
402 - it's because Bridget thought you were a child.\\
403 - Turns out she's the one who keeps you a child\\
404 - by controlling everything you do.\\
405 - Nuh-uh.\\
406 - Mark my words.\\
407 - Next, she'll start withholding sex.\\
408 - You'll be like a dog begging for a bone.\\
409 - Or a dog with a bone.\\
410 - Either way, a bone will be involved.\\
411 - Why is Zippy so upset?\\
412 - Walden asked him to move out.\\
413 - [laughing] It's about time.\\
414 - - Hey, Berta? - Yeah?\\
415 - Um, why don't you have a seat?\\
416 - Ah, crap.\\
417 -     Men       \\
418 - Hi, sleepyhead.\\
419 - - Hi. - Isn't this nice?\\
420 - Just the two of us?\\
421 - I'm a little groggy.\\
422 - What happened?\\
423 - I have a little surprise for you.\\
424 - Oh.\\
425 - What is it?\\
426 - My balls?\\
427 - No, sweetie.\\
428 - My balls.\\
429 - [screaming]\\
430 - - How'd it go with your ex-wife? - It was a nightmare.\\
431 -     Men       \\
432 -     Men       \\
433 - Uh, hello, future Alan Harper.\\
434 - Uh, it's you from the past.\\
435 - Uh, outlining my goals for the next 50 years.\\
436 - Uh, I hope this finds you still on this comfortable couch\\
437 - in this lovely beach house\\
438 - um, hopefully, uh, with Walden\\
439 - or whoever moves in after him.\\
440 - Nailed it.\\
441 - What?\\
442 - I-I said, "Nailed it."\\
443 - If you want coffee, go make coffee!\\
444 - Buffalo!\\

4 - So, uh, what are you wearing?\\
5 - Really? What kind of sweat pants?\\
6 - Ooh, big, old gray ones.\\
7 - Is it just me or are you getting turned on, too?\\
8 - It's...j-j-just me?\\

34 - Morning.\\
35 - Hey.\\
36 - Sorry again about last night.\\
37 - Sorry about what?\\
38 - The fact that my date and I came home\\
39 - last night to find a middle-aged man\\
40 - spraying water all over my kitchen\\
41 - in his tighty not-so-whities?\\
42 - I was putting out a fire.\\
43 - - I'm a hero. - Really?\\
44 - 'Cause it looked like you were posing\\
45 - for the World's Most Disturbing Firemen calendar.\\
46 - Okay, okay, I get it. You're a little upset.\\
47 - But I have something that will make you feel better.\\
48 - Ta-da.\\
49 - I went out to the drugstore and bought you\\
50 - a new toaster to replace the old one.\\
51 - The other one was better.\\
52 - Better?\\
53 - This is the Toast blaster Deluxe.\\
54 - This is the best thing to happen to sliced bread since..\\
55 - ...sliced bread.\\
56 - But mine had glass walls\\
57 - so you could watch the toast turn tropical brown.\\
58 - It was like a...little..\\
59 - ...bread tanning booth.\\
60 - Well, check this out, you know.\\
61 - Light, dark.\\
62 - Dark.\\
63 - Light.\\
64 - Okay, that's, uh..\\
65 - That's supposed to happen.\\
66 - That's-that's actually a safety feature.\\
67 - You know, common courtesy dictates\\
68 - that if you're gonna use my stuff\\
69 - and break my stuff that you replace my stuff\\
70 - with equally awesome stuff.\\
71 - This-this-this is what would happen\\
72 - if my toaster took a crap.\\
73 - What are you talking about?\\
74 - This is a perfectly good toaster.\\
75 - Look, okay, you know what? I'll prove it to you.\\
76 - Hope you're hungry.\\
77 - [machine whirring]\\
78 - Listen to that baby purr!\\
79 - I hate you.\\
80 -     Men       \\
81 - By the way in case I forget.\\
82 - I might be a little late on Monday.\\
83 - Oh, no problem.\\
84 - When should I expect you?\\
85 - Wednesday.\\
86 - Should I dock you for the time you miss?\\
87 - 'I wouldn't.'\\
88 - - Here you go. - What's this?\\
89 - I went to the store and I asked them\\
90 - "What is the stupidest thing I can buy?"\\
91 - And they gave me this toaster. Enjoy.\\
92 - You know, you didn't have to do that.\\
93 - Ah, you made it pretty clear that I did.\\
94 - In fact, I forwent replacing my cell phone to buy this.\\
95 - "Forwent?"\\
96 - It's a word.\\
97 - Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.\\
98 - Uh, and you don't have to worry about me ruining that one\\
99 - because I will never use it.\\
100 - Okay, stop being ridiculous.\\
101 - Ah! You want to know what's ridiculous?\\
102 - A glass toaster. What's next?\\
103 - A glass toilet so you can wave goodbye to the toast?\\
104 - How about a glass front door\\
105 - so I can wave goodbye to you?\\
106 - Oh, please! You would be lost without me.\\
107 - - I would be lost without you? - Yeah.\\
108 - Okay, the only thing that you've brought into my life\\
109 - is an oil-leaking Volvo\\
110 - a musty smell in my guest room\\
111 - and the word "forwent."\\
112 - It is the past tense of "forgo."\\
113 - Edify yourself, sir.\\
114 - And have you noticed\\
115 - that all the people in your life come and go\\
116 - but I am the one constant, I am always here.\\
117 - Maybe the reason they come and go\\
118 - is because you are always here.\\
119 - When a woman dumps you, who picks up the pieces?\\
120 - - Alan Harper. - And who picks up the check?\\
121 - Walden Schmidt.\\
122 - Of course, of course. Pull out the money card.\\
123 - They're called credit cards. Edify yourself, sir.\\
124 - Okay, if-if-if this is how you think\\
125 - then I don't even know why I'm living here.\\
126 - Oh, I do, because it's free!\\
127 - - Okay, okay, maybe I should go. - Maybe you should.\\
128 - - Fine. - Fine.\\
129 - - Okay. - Okay.\\
130 - I am not bluffing.\\
131 - Me neither.\\
132 - This is me opening the door.\\
133 - This is me watching.\\
134 - This is me leaving forever.\\
135 - This is me waving goodbye.\\
136 - And this is me homeless.\\
137 -     Men       \\
138 - You know what the problem is?\\
139 - Walden doesn't appreciate what I bring to the party.\\
140 - I've never seen you bring anything to a party.\\
141 - Except a Ziplocziploc bag to steal the shrimp.\\
142 - - Whose side are you on? - Yours, of course.\\
143 - Listen, I know you're upset\\
144 - but I'm sure you two lovebirds will kiss and make up.\\
145 - No, not happening, he does not want me back\\
146 - and I'm not going back.\\
147 - - You're not? - No.\\
148 - I have my self-respect.\\
149 - I do.\\
150 - So where are you gonna live?\\
151 - Where am I going to live? You're cute.\\
152 - Thanks. So where are you gonna live?\\
153 - Seriously?\\
154 - Alan, I wanna live with you.\\
155 - But when you move in I want it to be\\
156 - because I'm your first choice, not your last resort.\\
157 - - You are my first choice. - I'm your only choice.\\
158 - My one and only choice.\\
159 - Until Walden asks you to move back.\\
160 - Oh, please!\\
161 - I am offended that you could\\
162 - even suggest such a thing. You are the woman I love.\\
163 - The woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.\\
164 - Aw.. You're right, sweetie.\\
165 - - I'm sorry. You can move in. - Oh, thank you.\\
166 - It'll be nice sharing the place with you.\\
167 - Yeah, it's gonna be great.\\
168 - And we can split all the bills right down the middle.\\
169 - Ah..\\
170 - Oh, come on, you don't want my money.\\
171 - You're an independent woman.\\
172 - Walk proud.\\
173 - Walk over to this door and let me back in.\\
174 - [Herb] 'Hey, Alan.'\\
175 - Oh, God! Herb!\\
176 - - What-what are you doing? - Neighborhood watch.\\
177 - Oh, that's nice. I-I didn't even know there was one.\\
178 - There isn't.\\
179 - So, uh, you and Lyndsey have a little tiff?\\
180 - Oh, uh, not really a tiff, as much as, uh..\\
181 - Hey, are you still rattling around\\
182 - in that big old house all by yourself?\\
183 - Yeah, I don't think Judith's ever coming back.\\
184 - That's terrific...ly sad.\\
185 - You know what? At a time like this, you should not be alone.\\
186 - Let's go over to your place and have a few beers.\\
187 - You're a good friend, Alan.\\
188 - What can I say? I'm a giver.\\
189 - Say, do you still have the hide-a-bed in the den?\\
190 -     Men       \\
191 - Alright, I packed up all Zippy's stuff.\\
192 - It's sad.\\
193 - His entire life fits into one duffel bag.\\
194 - What's even sadder is it's my duffel bag.\\
195 - He's coming back you know that, right?\\
196 - No, he's not.\\
197 - He is a human boomerang.\\
198 - He's going to circle around, break a window\\
199 - and land right on your couch.\\
200 - [doorbell ringing]\\
201 - Open a window in the kitchen\\
202 - maybe he'll just go straight through.\\
203 - - Alan. - Walden.\\
204 - Don't worry, I'm just here to pick up my things\\
205 - and then I'll be on my way.\\
206 - Where you heading, Zippy, back to Mommy's?\\
207 - Living with my mother that's pretty pathetic, isn't it?\\
208 - No, for your information\\
209 - I am living with my ex-wife's, ex-husband\\
210 - at my ex-house.\\
211 - Yeah, that's not pathetic.\\
212 - I packed your things for you.\\
213 - Oh. I presume this is everything?\\
214 - - You presume correct. - Hmm.\\
215 - Your clothes, your toaster\\
216 - and your expired Mexican boner pills.\\
217 - Is it lonely up there, Walden?\\
218 - Is it lonely on your cloud of judgment?\\
219 - I don't know, maybe you could leave, so I could find out.\\
220 - Alright, then, goodbye.\\
221 - Berta, are you crying?\\
222 - I can't help it.\\
223 - I'm just so damn happy.\\
224 -     Men       \\
225 -     Men       \\
226 - Here you go.\\
227 - Two eggs over easy, silver dollar pancakes\\
228 - apple wood smoked bacon and whole grain toast.\\
229 - This is delightful, Alan.\\
230 - You really know how to spoil your man.\\
231 - And you know how to flatter yours.\\
232 - Wow, it seems like just yesterday\\
233 - I was living here with Judith.\\
234 - Only difference now is\\
235 - I actually have a chance at getting laid.\\
236 - Well, if dinner's as good as breakfast\\
237 - you've got more than a chance.\\
238 - Seriously, I-I really appreciate you letting me stay here.\\
239 - Ah, well, it's nice to have someone around again.\\
240 - It's been a little lonely since Judith left.\\
241 - I found it lonely even when Judith was here.\\
242 - Yeah, I've been watching TV alone and drinking alone.\\
243 - I even painted a moustache on the bathroom mirror\\
244 - so I'd have someone to talk to.\\
245 - R-really?\\
246 - Yeah. I call him Javier.\\
247 - Don't worry, Herb, you're better off.\\
248 - "Judith, she's a beetch."\\
249 - Can't argue with Javier.\\
250 - No, no, I wouldn't, he's got a fiery Latin temper.\\
251 - And a machete.\\
252 - Um, l-let me ask you something.\\
253 - Does Herb have a machete?\\
254 -     Men       \\
255 - Morning.\\
256 - Morning.\\
257 - Hey, Berta. Knock, knock.\\
258 - - Who's there? - Not Alan.\\
259 - Free at last, Walden.\\
260 - Thank God Almighty, we're free at last.\\
261 - Yeah. Although it is a little quieter around here.\\
262 - Get a dog, then it won't seem so weird\\
263 - when you catch him trying to lick himself.\\
264 - - Hey, Berta? - Yeah?\\
265 - What do you think about turning Alan's room, into a home gym?\\
266 - I was thinking about trying to grow pot in there, but okay.\\
267 - Hey, Berta?\\
268 - Yeah?\\
269 - What's going on with you?\\
270 - What do you mean?\\
271 - I don't know. Like..\\
272 - - How's your family? - Incarcerated.\\
273 - - That's funny. - Okay. Good talk.\\
274 - Hey...Berta?\\
275 - - Yeah? - Knock, knock.\\
276 - Who's there?\\
277 - It's Walden. Let me in.\\
278 - What are your hopes? What are your dreams?\\
279 - I'm just hoping to get out of this conversation.\\
280 - You're...you're on fire today.\\
281 - Yeah.\\
282 - Hey, Berta?\\
283 - Oh, for the love of God, what?\\
284 - - I like your vest. - Thanks.\\
285 - Where'd you get it, like, the vest store or something?\\
286 - Thank God I'm high.\\
287 -     Men       \\
288 - Easy, easy. Sound the horn.\\
289 - Let the town folk know you're coming.\\
290 - The 9:04 from Pemberton, now arriving on track one.\\
291 - Right on time.\\
292 - I-I had no idea this was so much fun.\\
293 - I know. Look, Alan..\\
294 - The McDougal boy's coming home from college.\\
295 - What a reunion this will be.\\
296 - Welcome home, Jimmy!\\
297 - Wow, you've, uh, created your own little world here.\\
298 - Oh, yeah, and this world's perfect.\\
299 - Well...almost perfect.\\
300 - Jimmy's brother Bobby\\
301 - got a little too close to the tracks one night.\\
302 - Him and his friends were playing chicken with a freight train.\\
303 - They found his letterman jacket three towns away.\\
304 - - Oh, no. - Yeah.\\
305 - Engineer Stan never got over it.\\
306 - He stopped talking to Helen.\\
307 - He just sits in his room and paints.\\
308 - Huh. That's, uh...that's disturbing.\\
309 - On a couple of levels.\\
310 - You know it's so nice having you here.\\
311 - I don't know why, but train enthusiasts\\
312 - tend to be loners.\\
313 - Yeah. It's a mystery.\\
314 - Hello?\\
315 - Hey, Herb. It's Walden.\\
316 - Oh. Hey, hold on a sec.\\
317 - Uh, I got to take this, it's the office.\\
318 - No problem, I was thinking of heading over to the bar car\\
319 - to pick us up a couple of frosty brews. You want one?\\
320 - Oh, make mine a root beer.\\
321 - This town's seen enough tragedy.\\
322 - - Hey, what's up? - Is Alan there?\\
323 - Uh, actually, no, I haven't seen him all day.\\
324 - I was really hoping to talk to him.\\
325 - You can't talk to a person that's not here.\\
326 - Unless you draw a mustache on the mirror.\\
327 - What?\\
328 - Is there a message I can give him?\\
329 - Yeah, just tell him I think I overreacted\\
330 - and have him give me a call.\\
331 - Done and done. Bye-bye.\\
332 - Everything okay at the office?\\
333 - Uh, actually, it, uh, it wasn't work.\\
334 - No?\\
335 - It was the, uh...president of the railroad.\\
336 - He asked me to give you this.\\
337 - Congratulations, Conductor Alan!\\
338 - Oh, my God! Thank you!\\
339 - Now, let's get that coal car unloaded\\
340 - and head over to the diner.\\
341 - Take a look at the new waitress.\\
342 - Word around town is she goes all the way.\\
343 -     Men       \\
344 - [call on computer]\\
345 - Hey, Jake!\\
346 - Hey, Walden.\\
347 - How are you? What's going on, buddy?\\
348 - Not much. Is my dad there?\\
349 - No. He actually moved out.\\
350 - [laughing] Good one!\\
351 - No, I'm-I'm serious.\\
352 - We got in a fight, and he left.\\
353 - My dad left that house?\\
354 - Yeah. We got in a fight, 'cause he bought a cheap toaster.\\
355 - W-wait, wait. And he bought something?\\
356 - Yeah. And I didn't show any appreciation for it.\\
357 - He bought something with his own money?\\
358 - I know. I shouldn't have screamed at him.\\
359 - I-I should have thrown him a parade.\\
360 - Wait a second, am I being punk'd?\\
361 - Hey, you know, I got an idea.\\
362 - Um, you know, just 'cause your dad doesn't live here anymore\\
363 - doesn't mean that you couldn't come stay for a couple of days.\\
364 - And do what?\\
365 - I don't know, like hang out, do guy stuff.\\
366 - We could go to a bar and get drunk.\\
367 - Mm, I'm only 19, I can't drink.\\
368 - Well, fine, we could just get high.\\
369 - Dude, just call my dad and tell him you want him to come back.\\
370 - What if he says no?\\
371 - Oh, you're serious.\\
372 - He's not gonna say no. Where has he even been living?\\
373 - He moved into you guy's old house with Herb.\\
374 - Wow. If there was a Freeloaders Hall of Fame\\
375 - my dad would be living in it.\\
376 - For free.\\
377 -     Men       \\
378 - [doorbell dings]\\
379 - - Hi, Herb. - Walden.\\
380 - - What are you doing here? - I came to talk to Alan.\\
381 - - Oh. - Sorry, he's not home.\\
382 - - I'll tell him you stopped by. - Who's at the door?\\
383 - Nobody! Go back in the train room!\\
384 - Alan?\\
385 - Walden?\\
386 - What's, uh, what's going on?\\
387 - I wanted to say that I'm sorry.\\
388 - - Really? - Yes.\\
389 - Super. Hatchet buried.\\
390 - We'll have you over for Thanksgiving.\\
391 - Hold on.\\
392 - I never meant to make you feel unwelcome in my home.\\
393 - Well, Alan has a new place now.\\
394 - A place where he's appreciated.\\
395 - A place where he feels safe.\\
396 - A place where he can cry himself to sleep at night\\
397 - without the fear of being mocked.\\
398 - Y-you heard that?\\
399 - There's still a baby monitor in there.\\
400 - So you also heard..\\
401 - Let it go, Alan.\\
402 - I appreciate you, too.\\
403 - Th-that's why I've been leaving messages with Herb for days.\\
404 - - What? - You haven't gotten them?\\
405 - - Herb.. - I'm sorry.\\
406 - I just wanted a friend.\\
407 - You know, one who wasn't trapped in a mirror.\\
408 - Oh, Herb.\\
409 - - I brought you something. - You did?\\
410 - You don't happen to have a toaster, do you?\\
411 - I have a toaster. I also have a..\\
412 - A guest room with a king-size bed\\
413 - and a new 42-inch flat-screen TV.\\
414 - - There's no TV in there. - There could be.\\
415 - Really?\\
416 - Your turn.\\
417 - I'm not gonna try to buy you.\\
418 - I mean, you're either my friend or you're not.\\
419 - I have no such qualms, I'll throw in a Blu-ray player.\\
420 - Wow. Okay, alright, I'm out of here.\\
421 - No, no, wait, wait, wait.\\
422 - Herb..\\
423 - I-I can't thank you enough for taking me in, but..\\
424 - ..as you can see... Walden needs me.\\
425 - - I wouldn't go that far. - Shh..\\
426 - Let me, uh, let me get my things.\\

27 - What brings you by?\\
28 - Oh, you, uh, left your wallet at my house.\\
29 - [chuckles] I didn't even notice it was missing.\\
30 - Really? It's been over a week.\\
31 - Hard to notice something's missing when you never use it.\\
32 - - Well, thank you. - Oh, no problem.\\
33 - Hey, I want to apologize for my behavior lately.\\
34 - I've been in a real dark place since Judith left.\\
35 - No apologies necessary.\\
36 - Uh, the important thing is you're feeling better.\\
37 - Well, I'm not putting her nightgown on a pillow\\
38 - and spooning it anymore, so, uh..\\
39 - Yeah, coming out of the darkness.\\

46 - Where does it hurt?\\
47 - - Uh, it's my balls. - Oh.\\
48 - I'm gonna have to stick my hands down your pants.\\
49 - For once I'm glad I didn't make it into medical school.\\
50 - Make it stop, make it stop.\\
51 - Ooh. A little swampy down here.\\
52 - I wasn't expecting company.\\
53 - Oh, oh, I see.\\
54 - You've got a twist in your spermatic chord.\\
55 - I'm gonna have to perform a manual detorsion on your testes.\\
56 - What does that mean?\\
57 - Your nuts are in a knot I need to untie 'em.\\
58 - No, no, no!\\
59 - Look, it's either that or your blood supply will be cut off.\\
60 - You might lose a testicle.\\

80 - [laughing]\\
81 - - There you go. - Whoa!\\
82 - And just like that, I'm a grower, not a shower.\\
83 - I know it's uncomfortable but you need to ice the soreness\\
84 - for 20 minutes every couple hours\\
85 - and avoid sudden movements.\\
86 - How did this happen?\\
87 - Well, imagine your testicles\\
88 - hanging like wind chimes.\\

108 - You should avoid strenuous activity\\
109 - and I'd, uh, like to schedule a follow-up in a couple weeks.\\
110 - Sounds good.\\
111 - Hey, while you're here, uh\\
112 - can I ask you a little personal advice?\\
113 - You had your hands down my pants on two separate occasions.\\
114 - If you were a woman, I'd be meeting your parents now.\\
115 - Well, you've been dumped a lot, right?\\
116 - No.\\
117 - I mean, what's "a lot?" I..\\
118 - Yes, I have.\\
119 - How did you get over your wife leaving you?\\
120 - [chuckles]\\
121 - You know the five stages of grief?\\
122 - Sure.\\
123 - They left out the three best ones\\
124 - pot, one-night stands, and buying a beach house.\\
125 - I don't know, I'm not sure that's me.\\
126 - You can't just sit around feeling sorry for yourself.\\
127 - I'm getting so good at it.\\
128 - Gets better. You just got to get out there and meet somebody new.\\
129 - It's tough. Judith and I were together for a long time.\\
130 - I get it.\\
131 - She was your world.\\
132 - But trust me.\\
133 - You will meet someone else to spend\\
134 - the rest of your life with.\\
135 - In my case, it was Alan.\\
136 - Yeah, I'm surrounded by sick kids all day.\\
137 - Where am I gonna meet someone?\\
138 - You just gotta keep your heart and your eyes open.\\
139 - [whispers] Who are they?\\
140 - Oh, they're our pharmaceutical reps.\\
141 - They come by and give away free drugs.\\
142 - Yeah, where are you gonna meet someone?\\
143 -     Men       \\
144 - Okay, I got a good feeling about this one.\\
145 - This is my house.\\
146 - Okay, Mr. Driver, we're good.\\
147 - Bye-bye.\\
148 - Ladies, I must warn you\\
149 - that once you cross this threshold\\
150 - you waive your right to sobriety\\
151 - chastity\\
152 - dignity..\\
153 - ...and a couple other "ity-ties."\\
154 - - Waived. - Yeah, me, too.\\
155 - Oh, wow.\\
156 - This is so cool.\\
157 - Oh, my God, I can't believe this is happening.\\
158 - - Oh, it's happening. - Okay.\\
159 - What's the plan? Are we-are we two twosomes?\\
160 - Or a foursome?\\
161 - Or do you wanna have a threesome with them while I watch?\\
162 - 'Cause I'm fine with that.\\
163 - I'm not.\\
164 - Oh, okay, I'll just take the tall one.\\
165 - Which one's the tall one?\\
166 - I got this.\\
167 - Okay, ladies.\\
168 - Alcohol is this way.\\
169 - We don't want anyone sobering up and thinking things through.\\
170 - Hey, Alan!\\
171 - Hey, uh, uh, who are your friends?\\
172 - Oh, this is Plaxitril and she sells Kristen.\\
173 - No, no, no, I'm Kristen. I sell Plaxitril.\\
174 - I'm pretty sure it's the other way around.\\
175 - [Alan] 'It's, uh..'\\
176 - It's nice to meet you, Kristen.\\
177 - Oh, and this is Morgan.\\
178 - I sell boner pills and baby laxatives.\\
179 - - And I'm Herb. - Hi, Herb.\\
180 - Yes, I am.\\
181 - [Walden] 'Okay.'\\
182 - Salt, check, uh..\\
183 - [yells]\\
184 - Limes, check.\\
185 - Tequila, check.\\
186 - Two gorgeous ladies.\\
187 - - Check. - Check.\\
188 - The doctor's ready to administer some shots.\\
189 - Some body shots.\\
190 - 'The deck..'\\
191 - Well, I guess I am gonna masturbate tonight.\\
192 -     Men       \\
193 - [Morgan] 'Did I tell you that I was a gymnast?'\\
194 - [Walden] 'You're kidding.'\\
195 - [Morgan] 'Nope. I was an alternate for the Olympic team.'\\
196 - 'I can totally put both of my legs behind my head.'\\
197 - 'Watch.'\\
198 - [Walden and Herb] 'USA! USA! USA!'\\
199 - [Kristen] 'Okay, I can't do that, but I can put'\\
200 - 'my entire fist in my mouth.'\\
201 - 'Check it out.'\\
202 - [Walden] 'Beautiful and talented.'\\
203 - [Kristen muffled] 'Thank you.'\\
204 - Yep, definitely masturbating.\\
205 - [women giggling]\\
206 - Hey, Alan!\\
207 - Hey, uh, you guys having fun?\\
208 - Yeah, I was just getting more tequila.\\
209 - How are you?\\
210 - I'm good. Just-just watching "Downton Abbey."\\
211 - Big episode. Someone stole a spoon.\\
212 - [Morgan] 'Walden, get the video camera!'\\
213 - Aw, good idea.\\
214 - There's gonna be a video.\\
215 - Hey, Alan? Do you got any Crisco?\\
216 - Uh, there's some olive oil by the stove.\\
217 - That'll work.\\
218 - Have you seen my bra?\\
219 - Uh, uh, no.\\
220 - Your son hid it somewhere.\\
221 - I'm sorry, my-my son?\\
222 - Yeah, Walden.\\
223 - Hey, Alan.\\
224 - Have you seen Plaxitril?\\
225 - [giggles]\\
226 -     Men       \\
227 - Morning.\\
228 - Hey, what's that for?\\
229 - You can't carry a toilet bowl.\\
230 - Are you drunk or hungover?\\
231 - Yes.\\
232 - What happened last night?\\
233 - A lot of gray areas.\\
234 - There was tequila.\\
235 - [gags]\\
236 - A walk on the beach.\\
237 - And then the coast guard escorted\\
238 - our boat back to shore.\\
239 - Wait, your-your boat?\\
240 - Well, not technically.\\
241 - I commandeered it.\\
242 - Apparently Plaxitril has a pirate side effect.\\
243 - Top of the morning to you.\\
244 - How are you in such a good mood?\\
245 - Three pills, two pukes and a poo and I'm good to go.\\
246 - You know what? You were right.\\
247 - I can't sit around feeling sorry for myself.\\
248 - Last night was a revelation for me.\\
249 - I have never felt so alive.\\
250 - Which is ironic, because I believe\\
251 - for a few minutes last night, I was legally dead.\\
252 - Now...who wants a Bloody Mary?\\
253 - I'll have one.\\
254 - Don't judge me. You stole a boat.\\
255 - Attaboy. How about you, Walden?\\
256 - I don't think I can have any more alcohol.\\
257 - [imitates Walden] "I don't think I can have any more alcohol."\\
258 - Man up. I didn't fix those nuts so you could grow a vagina.\\
259 - - Alright, I'll have one. - Attagirl.\\
260 -     Men       \\
261 - Alan?\\
262 - Alan?\\
263 - What?\\
264 - What time is it?\\
265 - 6:30.\\
266 - Is the sun going up or down?\\
267 - Not a clue.\\
268 - What the hell?\\
269 - [instrumental music]\\
270 - Hey! Look who finally woke up.\\
271 - What's going on?\\
272 - We're having a party.\\
273 - How?\\
274 - Well, Morgan and Kristen came over.\\
275 - I sent out a couple tweets.\\
276 - I posted a couple of pictures on Instagram.\\
277 - Bing-bang-boom, here we are.\\
278 - I chat on AOL a lot.\\
279 - Okay, I think we need to shut this down.\\
280 - Ah, yeah, yeah, we are fried.\\
281 - Oh, here, these'll fix you up.\\
282 - Are you a pharmaceutical rep, too?\\
283 - No. I'm a junior at Pepperdine.\\
284 - Pepperdine's a good school.\\
285 -     Men       \\
286 -     Men       \\
287 - Wow. This looks like Charlie Sheen's house.\\
288 - Alan.\\
289 - Alan, wake up.\\
290 - [bottles clattering]\\
291 - Pepperdine is not a good school.\\
292 - Why am I face down\\
293 - on the back of the sofa in my underwear?\\
294 - Because I was kind enough to put underwear on you.\\
295 - How did this happen?\\
296 - Herb.\\
297 - Oh, that guy's out of control.\\
298 - This house is a mess.\\
299 - Maybe I should I just cut my losses and sell it.\\
300 - Do not even joke like that.\\
301 - Oh, Berta, thank God you're here.\\
302 - Aw, hell no.\\
303 -     Men       \\
304 - Th-this was a very good idea.\\
305 - Yeah. It's like an adult diaper for your mouth.\\
306 - Uh! Wow. Swimming in the ocean is the best cure for a hangover.\\
307 - Well, that and pharmaceutical cocaine.\\
308 - Time to have the talk?\\
309 - Yeah.\\
310 - Hey, Herb, you got a sec?\\
311 - Sure.\\
312 - You're gonna have to come to us.\\
313 - What's up?\\
314 - Alan has something he wants to tell you.\\
315 - You know, you know, Herb we-we, we think you're a lot of fun.\\
316 - Yeah, the last few weeks have been a blast.\\
317 - - It's been two days. - Oh, good lord!\\
318 - I guess what we're saying is\\
319 - maybe it's time to get back to our regular lives.\\
320 - My regular life sucks.\\
321 - No, it doesn't.\\
322 - You're-you're just upset because Judith left you.\\
323 - Yeah, and I haven't thought about her at all\\
324 - the last two days.\\
325 - Or weeks. Whichever we agreed is real.\\
326 - And-and that's great, but you know, we just..\\
327 - We have to slow down a bit.\\
328 - Yeah, just take a break.\\
329 - You know, get back to normal.\\
330 - You know, sleep, eat, bathe.\\
331 - Pass a field sobriety test.\\
332 - Wait. Are you kicking me out?\\
333 - - Oh, no-- - Uh, uh..\\
334 - No, we're not kicking you out so much as..\\
335 - Yeah, we're kicking you out.\\
336 - I see.\\
337 - I-I mean, it's nothing personal.\\
338 - Just, you know, sometimes, uh, uh..\\
339 - Yes, it's personal.\\
340 - Well, say no more.\\
341 - I know when it's time to go.\\
342 - - I'm-I'm sorry, Herb. - I said, say no more!\\
343 -     Men       \\
344 - Oh, hey. I got new trash cans.\\
345 - They're wicker.\\
346 - - What's the problem? = You can't puke in wicker.\\
347 - It's like using a mesh condom.\\
348 - All the important stuff gets through.\\
349 - Fine. I'll return them.\\
350 - Of course, I'll need to hold onto your credit card\\
351 - for a few more days.\\
352 - Of course you will.\\
353 - Hey, you haven't talked to Herb lately, have you?\\
354 - No. I texted him a couple days ago, but he never responded.\\
355 - Hmm. I called him, invited him over for dinner\\
356 - and I never heard back.\\
357 - - You think he's okay, right? - Yeah. Why wouldn't he be?\\
358 - Exactly.\\
359 - I mean, you know, other than the fact\\
360 - that his marriage just fell apart.\\
361 - And the last time we saw him\\
362 - he was counteracting pharmaceutical cocaine\\
363 - by snorting cat tranquilizers.\\
364 - And then we go kick him out.\\
365 - Oh, my God, we killed Herb.\\
366 - No, no, that's not true.\\
367 - You killed Herb.\\
368 -     Men       \\
369 - It's pretty cool that you can track\\
370 - somebody from their credit card.\\
371 - Yeah. I'd track you if you ever used yours.\\
372 - Alan, Walden, what are you doing here?\\
373 - We were worried about you.\\
374 - No need. Me and the girls were just about to eat.\\
375 - - Lobster? - No.\\
376 - You're still partying with the pharmaceutical reps?\\
377 - They bailed. These chicks came with the room.\\
378 - Okay, Herb, it's time for the party to end.\\
379 - We're way past partying.\\
380 - Welcome to the freak show.\\
381 - You're right about that!\\
382 - - Herb, you need help. - No, no, I don't.\\
383 - All I need is more Plaxitril\\
384 - and possibly a hepatitis test.\\
385 - So long.\\
386 - And we were worried.\\
387 -     Men       \\
388 - Well, if it isn't Mr. and Mrs. Buzzkill.\\
389 - You're the missus.\\
390 - - Why are you wearing a diaper? - Saves time.\\
391 - Alright, enough is enough, Herb.\\
392 - It's time to put your life back together.\\
393 - You need to go home.\\
394 - No. I don't think so.\\
395 - You see, out there, I'm just Herb\\
396 - but here in room 204 at the Budget Motor Inn, I'm God.\\
397 - Nobody tells God what to do. Nobody!\\
398 - - Judith? - Cut the crap, Herb. Let's go.\\
399 - Okay.\\
400 - - I missed you. - Shut up!\\
401 - You think we did the right thing?\\
402 - Oh, definitely.\\
403 - If he would have kept this up, he wouldn't have lasted a week.\\
404 - True. Now he'll only be dead on the inside.\\
405 - [sheep bleating]\\
406 - Walk, walk, walk.\\
407 - Was that sheep wearing lipstick?\\
408 - Don't look back.\\
409 -     Men       \\
410 -     Men       \\
411 - Well, everything still looks fine.\\
412 - No more follow-ups?\\
413 - Nope. Dumbo's good to go.\\
414 - [grunts]\\
415 - - So how are things with you? - Oh, could not be better.\\
416 - I really appreciate what you and Alan did for me.\\
417 - That's what friends are for.\\
418 - Plus, Judith and I are back together.\\
419 - I'm a happy man, Walden.\\
420 - [knock on door]\\
421 - Come in.\\
422 - - Dr. Melnick? - Yeah.\\
423 - Here's that chart you asked for.\\
424 - Thank you.\\
425 - Isn't that the girl from Pepper..\\

1 - [Jake] Previously on "Two And A Half Men."\\
2 - - Hello? - Hey, dad.\\
3 - Uh, this is my girlfriend, Tammy.\\
4 - Uh, Tammy, this is my dad, Alan.\\
5 - It's a pleasure to meet you.\\
6 - How did you two meet?\\
7 - A couple of us guys from the base\\
8 - went out drinking and they bet me a hundred bucks\\
9 - that I wouldn't get this tattoo\\
10 - of two arms coming out of my butt crack.\\
11 - Oh, Jake, you didn't.\\
12 - - No, Tammy wouldn't let me. - Thank you for that.\\
13 - I took one look at his ass and I thought\\
14 - I don't want to tattoo that, I want to bite that.\\
15 - She's old enough to have you as her kid.\\
16 - So what? You are, too.\\
17 - I-I don't understand why you're with Jake.\\
18 - The bottom line is, I think your son is terrific.\\
19 - And I know what we have isn't gonna last forever\\
20 - but it's what I want in my life right now.\\
21 - And I don't know when the last time you had sex\\
22 - with a 19-year-old boy was, but it is a lot of fun.\\
23 -     Men       \\
24 - What a nice surprise to have you home for the weekend.\\
25 - - Well, it's good to be home. - Okay.\\
26 - I hate to be the one to break up this happy reunion\\
27 - but you both do realize this is not your home.\\
28 - He's cute.\\
29 - He really is though.\\
30 - So, uh, so what's going on? Anything new in the army?\\
31 - Oh, did I tell you I got promoted?\\
32 - I'm in charge of three other guys in the kitchen now.\\
33 - Wow! My son, the leader.\\
34 - Yeah, it's awesome. They have to do whatever I say.\\
35 - I made this one guy chug a tray of hot dog water.\\
36 - Uh, why would you do that?\\
37 - It's called earning respect, dad.\\
38 - I-I don't understand.\\
39 - Which part? Earning or respect?\\
40 - Bazinga!\\
41 - Uh, it's from a TV show.\\
42 - So, uh, how are things with you and Tammy?\\
43 - Actually, we broke up.\\
44 - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?\\
45 - We just decided it wasn't gonna work out.\\
46 - We had unrecognizable differences.\\
47 - Uh, u-unrecognizable differences?\\
48 - Yeah, you know, when you can't see what the problem is\\
49 - but you just have to break up anyway.\\
50 - [doorbell rings]\\
51 - Somehow that actually makes sense.\\
52 - So, are you doing okay? I know breakups can be hard.\\
53 - Yeah, it actually helps to focus on my career.\\
54 - Get this, one time, I made the guys\\
55 - stick their things in pudding.\\
56 - They must respect you so much.\\
57 - - Tammy. - Where the hell is he?\\
58 - I assume that you're talking..\\
59 - - Jake! - Uh-oh, uh-oh.\\
60 - Get back here, you son of a bitch!\\
61 - I am gonna kill you!\\
62 - I sense that he didn't tell us everything.\\
63 -     Men men men men    \\
64 -     Manly men men men    \\
65 -     Men men men men        Oo-o-o-o-o-h    \\

76 - - No. - How about now?\\
77 - Ow, ow, ow.\\
78 - Wait, what-what the hell is going on?\\
79 - Tell them.\\
80 - Um, I broke up with Tammy to see another girl.\\
81 - Oh, well, you know, sometimes relationships run their course--\\
82 - Tell them who it was.\\
83 - - I don't think they really-- - Tell them!\\
84 - Ow!\\
85 - It was her daughter.\\
86 - Wait, wait, you, you slept\\
87 - with your girlfriend's daughter?\\
88 - Jerry Springer is taped before a live studio audience.\\
89 - I trusted you to be a good influence on Ashley.\\
90 - You know, it was your idea for us to spend time together.\\
91 - You were supposed to be tutoring her in math!\\
92 - What were you thinking?\\
93 - Jake tutoring math? What were you thinking?\\
94 - I figured you were gonna find another girl someday.\\
95 - I just didn't think it would be the one\\
96 - that came from my uterus.\\
97 - I'm sorry, it just sort of happened.\\
98 - Ow!\\
99 - Sorry, it just sort of happened.\\
100 - Jake, did you even once consider\\
101 - that there were other people involved?\\
102 - Yeah, of course. I mean, that's what made it so hot.\\
103 - - Her mom was in the other room. - That's it, I'm killing him!\\
104 - - Oh, no, no. - Dad, dad!\\
105 - Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!\\
106 -     Men       \\
107 - Okay. Walk me through this.\\
108 - Start from the beginning.\\
109 - Well, by all accounts, I was a happy baby.\\
110 - Okay.\\
111 - Fast-forward.\\
112 - You and Tammy's daughter.\\
113 - - How? - Alright.\\
114 - Imagine Tammy at 18, in a string bikini, crying on your shoulder\\
115 - saying, "Why can't all guys be like you?"\\
116 - Walden?\\
117 - Oh, sorry, I was still imagining.\\
118 - It was the perfect storm.\\
119 - Ashley had just broken up with her boyfriend\\
120 - and Tammy was asleep. I'm the victim here.\\
121 - Okay, I..\\
122 - On one hand, your behavior is despicable.\\
123 - On the other, the elusive mother-daughter combo.\\
124 - Up top.\\
125 - But last time you were here\\
126 - you were saying that Tammy was the love of your life\\
127 - and you wanted to marry her.\\
128 - What can I say? I was young and naive back then.\\
129 - That was six weeks ago.\\
130 - I never meant to hurt Tammy. I care about them both.\\
131 - Hey, do you think there would ever be a chance\\
132 - I could get them both together..\\
133 - You're adorable.\\
134 -     Men       \\
135 - What the hell is wrong with your son?\\
136 - That is a question for the ages.\\
137 - Kind of like, "If there really is a God, why is there so much\\
138 - sorrow in the world?" or..\\
139 - "How have I managed to keep living\\
140 - in this house all these years?"\\
141 - You know, I'm tempted to sleep with you\\
142 - just to get back at him.\\
143 - Oh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm flattered, but I-I actually..\\
144 - I was just kidding.\\
145 - How could he do this to me?\\
146 - Well, you said yourself\\
147 - you knew this thing with Jake wasn't gonna last.\\
148 - Yeah, but there are plenty of other little skanks in our town.\\
149 - Why did he have to pick my little skank?\\
150 - I wish there was something that would make you feel better.\\
151 - - Uh, what if Jake apologized? - What if I cut his balls off?\\
152 - So we've got options.\\
153 -     Men       \\
154 - Alright, you two, now-now let's, uh, let's think\\
155 - of the couch as a safe place for communication.\\
156 - Uh, uh, neutral corner\\
157 - neutral corner.\\
158 - Now, and-and this, uh, this pillow represents\\
159 - the wall of respect.\\
160 - Okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna place it between the two of you.\\
161 - Okay? Now, uh, Tammy\\
162 - would you like to start?\\
163 - Hey, hey!\\
164 - She hit me with the wall of respect.\\
165 - And you slept with my daughter.\\
166 - So we'll call it even?\\
167 - - Hey! - What's going on?\\
168 - Oh, well, it's complicated.\\
169 - Uh, remember Jake's girlfriend Tammy?\\
170 - She has an 18-year-old daughter.\\
171 - And Jake nailed her.\\
172 - Okay, not that complicated.\\
173 - Uh, Jake, do you want to say something?\\
174 - Alright. Uh..\\
175 - I'm sorry for cheating on you with your daughter.\\
176 - But, I mean, when you think about it\\
177 - it's really a compliment.\\
178 - 'Cause she's just a much younger version of you.\\
179 - [doorbell rings]\\
180 - I'll get that.\\
181 - I didn't know Jake had it in him.\\
182 - Apparently, he's had it in everybody.\\
183 - - Ashley? - Baby!\\
184 - Get your mouth off my daughter, you cheating son of a bitch!\\
185 - Oh, that would make a great country song.\\
186 - Ashley, what are you doing here?\\
187 - Mom, I know you're upset and that's why I came, but..\\
188 - Hey, is that my shirt?\\
189 - - Hey, is that my boyfriend? - Oh, please!\\
190 - Like you haven't stolen boyfriends from me before.\\
191 - He was your teacher!\\
192 - Yeah, and thanks to you, I failed biology.\\
193 - No, biology failed me!\\
194 - This makes me so homesick.\\
195 - Come on, mom.\\
196 - No, Ashley, I am not gonna let you throw\\
197 - your life away for this loser.\\
198 - Hey, hey, that loser is my son. And your ex-boyfriend.\\
199 - Yeah, I was just having fun.\\
200 - Ashley needs to think about her future.\\
201 - Hey, he has a very bright..\\
202 - You know what, this is family business.\\
203 - You are not the boss of me.\\
204 - If I want to date a loser, then I will.\\
205 - Thank you.\\
206 - [doorbell rings]\\
207 - I can actually feel my IQ dropping.\\
208 - - Are you Jake's father? - Yeah. Oh!\\
209 - You don't have to pay me for today.\\
210 -     Men       \\
211 -     Men       \\
212 - What the hell? Why did you hit me?\\
213 - Because I can't hit a kid.\\
214 - And your son's messing with my Ashley.\\
215 - You're Ashley's dad?\\
216 - - Ew, no! - Ew, no!\\
217 - I'm her boyfriend.\\
218 - - Ew, no! - Ew, no!\\
219 - He's my ex-boyfriend. I'm with Jake now.\\
220 - Oh, come on, I take craps bigger than him.\\
221 - Takes me an hour and a half, but I do it.\\
222 - What are you doing here, Jerry?\\
223 - Whoa, Jerry?\\
224 - From Jerry's Cadillac in Tustin?\\
225 - That's right, son. "No credit? No problem."\\
226 - Really?\\
227 - "Want a Caddy, I'm yourdaddy."\\
228 - I want a daddy.\\
229 - I want you back, Ashley.\\
230 - Whatever. Too little, too late, Jer-Bear.\\
231 - Yeah, Jer-Bear.\\
232 - You know, it's like that old song\\
233 - "If you liked it, then you should've put a ring on it."\\
234 - Well, I bought you a belly ring.\\
235 - Oh, that was you? I chipped my tooth on that thing.\\
236 - Uh, just out of curiosity\\
237 - how did you meet Hannah Montana here?\\
238 - It's actually a cute story.\\
239 - We were shooting a commercial for our\\
240 - Fourth of July Savings Spectacular.\\
241 - I was dressed as Uncle Sam with a row of pretty girls\\
242 - behind me wearing bikinis and waving sparklers.\\
243 - I took one look at Ashley, pointed at her and said\\
244 - "Uncle Sam wants you."\\
245 - That is a cute story.\\
246 - Fireworks went off in my pants that night.\\
247 - Okay, not so cute anymore.\\
248 - How can you not love a girl like this?\\
249 - She's smart, she's funny, and she's got a better body\\
250 - than the new SRX Crossover.\\
251 - - Don't you, darling? - Don't "Darling" me.\\
252 - You had your chance and you blew it.\\
253 - Oh, come on, Ashley. I've been married four times.\\
254 - And you know why they didn't work.\\
255 - I got a mistress, and her name\\
256 - is Customer Satisfaction.\\
257 - Alright, look, Jerry, if my little girl doesn't want\\
258 - to see you, then you got to go.\\
259 - - Thanks, mom. - Shut up!\\
260 - Okay.\\
261 - It takes two to make a deal.\\
262 - But know this, Ashley..\\
263 - I guarantee, I will always love you.\\
264 - Just like I guarantee, no one can beat my prices.\\
265 -     If you need a set of wheels Jerry's making super deals    \\
266 -     At Jerry's Cadillac       \\
267 - Oh, come on. It's catchy.\\
268 -     Men       \\
269 - - God, I've failed as a parent. - No.\\
270 - - Yeah. - Maybe.\\
271 - My beautiful young daughter has narrowed her choices\\
272 - down to a 19-year-old, who needs to ask the Wizard for a brain..\\
273 - ...and a sleazy car salesman\\
274 - who barely escaped a "Dateline special".\\
275 - Okay, so it's not an ideal situation. But what is?\\
276 - Sometimes kids make mistakes.\\
277 - Yeah, sometimes kids are mistakes.\\
278 - Well, look, when I was a kid, I made a lot of choices\\
279 - my parents didn't agree with. Like, dropping out of MIT.\\
280 - And that turned out great.\\
281 - Somehow I don't think Ashley's\\
282 - on the road to incredible wealth.\\
283 - She's more on the road\\
284 - to antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea.\\
285 - Wow. That's just..\\
286 - Wow!\\
287 - When is it gonna stop?\\
288 - When's what gonna stop?\\
289 - The taking.\\
290 - I mean, that's all kids ever do.\\
291 - I mean, first they take over your body\\
292 - like a little parasite.\\
293 - And then they trash your fun zone on the way out.\\
294 - Then they suck your boobs until your nipples look\\
295 - like the worn-out thumb on a work glove.\\
296 - You do paint a picture with your words.\\
297 - And then it gets really bad.\\
298 - They take your sleep, your time\\
299 - your favorite dress, keys to your car\\
300 - the weed you had hidden in a cowboy boot\\
301 - in the back of your closet.\\
302 - Leave it up to my daughter\\
303 - to go the extra mile and take my boyfriend.\\
304 - And you know why you keep giving?\\
305 - Because I'm a glutton for punishment?\\
306 - Because you love her, and you want what's best for her.\\
307 - I suppose.\\
308 - Okay, let me ask you this.\\
309 - Were you happy with Jake?\\
310 - I mean, you know, before he started\\
311 - climbing the family tree.\\
312 - Honestly, Jake's a great guy.\\
313 - So, isn't it possible that he may also be\\
314 - a great guy for your daughter?\\
315 - - No. - Yes.\\
316 - Maybe.\\
317 - Really? The thumb on a work glove?\\
318 - Oh, honey, that was two boob jobs ago.\\
319 - These puppies can cut glass now.\\
320 -     Men       \\
321 - Sorry Jerry hit you, dad.\\
322 - So am I.\\
323 - Yeah, what was that about, I mean, he won't hit a kid\\
324 - but he'll hit somebody way older than him?\\
325 - What?\\
326 - I said, "He won't hit a kid\\
327 - but he'll hit someone way older than him!"\\
328 - Hey.\\
329 - [sighs] I have something I want to say to you two.\\
330 - Don't care.\\
331 - I swear to God, Ashley, I paid to get those teeth straight\\
332 - I will crooked 'em up again!\\
333 - Up-bup-bup-bup. Eye on the ball, Tammy. Eye on the ball.\\
334 - If you two want to be with each other\\
335 - I am not gonna stand in your way.\\
336 - Really?\\
337 - You think you can be happy together\\
338 - then be happy together.\\
339 - Wow. Thank you, Tammy.\\
340 - I...guess I just hope Ashley and I can be as happy\\
341 - as you and I were.\\
342 - Stop talking.\\
343 - But I already am happy, Jake-Bear. Give me some sugar.\\
344 - This is the oddest family moment I have ever witnessed.\\
345 - Maybe I should grease up a pig\\
346 - in case they want to wrestle later.\\
347 - Jerry.\\
348 - I feel bad about before\\
349 - so I brought you an official Jerry's Cadillac beer koozie.\\
350 - I told you, it's over.\\
351 - You did.\\
352 - But I'm driving home..\\
353 - ...in my limited edition Escalade..\\
354 - ...when it hits me.\\
355 - If I've learned one thing in my 25 years\\
356 - as Orange County's number one dealer\\
357 - of premium luxury vehicles\\
358 - is that you don't take no for an answer.\\
359 - God, this guy's good.\\
360 - So I came back here to ask you just one question.\\
361 - What's it gonna take to get you into my life today?\\
362 - Oh, my God, look at the size of that rock.\\
363 - Dude, you can't buy her love with a diamond ring.\\
364 - But wait, there's more.\\
365 - My manager's gonna kill me, but if you say yes right now..\\
366 - ...I will throw in a 2012 powder blue Mercedes SL\\
367 - I just bought at a police auction.\\
368 - I don't know what to do.\\
369 - - Take the car! - Take the car!\\
370 - - Dad! - It's a Mercedes.\\
371 - - We got a deal, Ashley? - Sold!\\
372 - [all] Aw!\\
373 - [all] Ew!\\
374 - I love these people.\\
375 -     Men       \\
376 -     Men       \\
377 - [knock on door]\\
378 - Jake?\\
379 - - Doing okay? - I guess.\\
380 - I really screwed things up this time, didn't I?\\
381 - Well, you certainly screwed everything you could.\\
382 - I mean, I had such a good thing going.\\
383 - First, with Tammy, and then Ashley\\
384 - and...now I'm all alone.\\
385 - That's because you're a Harper.\\
386 - It's what we do.\\
387 - We take something good and turn it into nothing.\\
388 - I don't like being a Harper.\\
389 - Nobody does, son.\\
390 - Nobody does.\\
391 -     Men       \\
392 - What a day, huh?\\
393 - Yeah. Sorry about all the trouble.\\
394 - Oh. You kidding me?\\
395 - Jerry sold me an Escalade at dealer cost.\\
396 - Oh, honey, you didn't fall for that, did you?\\
397 - He really is the king, isn't he?\\
398 - And my daughter gets to be the queen.\\
399 - It's a white trash fairy tale.\\
400 - Hey. Let's talk about something happier.\\
401 - Remember when Alan got punched in the face?\\
402 - Yeah. That was awesome.\\
403 - - Mmm. - Yeah.\\
404 - You know, the older I get\\
405 - the less I understand about relationships.\\
406 - Me, too.\\
407 - I'm like a blind man trying to get out\\
408 - of a doorknob factory.\\
409 - I mean, how is that possible?\\
410 - I mean, you're handsome and smart and charming.\\
411 - You're embarrassing me.\\
412 - Go on.\\
413 - You got the whole package.\\
414 - Well, you do, too.\\
415 - I mean, you're beautiful, you're independent\\
416 - you're intelligent..\\
417 - Oh, stop.\\
418 - Well, don't actually stop.\\
419 - You're funny.\\
420 - You're..\\
421 - ...really, really beautiful.\\
422 - Okay, that probably wasn't a good idea.\\
423 - Definitely not.\\
424 - Berta's gonna love this.\\

\subsection {Episode 21: Another Night with Neil Diamond}
1 -     Men       \\
2 - - Oh. Hey. - Hi.\\
3 - I thought you and Alan were going out to dinner.\\
4 - We were supposed to, but then he discovered\\
5 - his coupon was only good for "to-go" orders.\\
6 - - That guy's a piece of work. - He is.\\
7 - Which is ironic, 'cause he never seems to go to work.\\
8 - That's true.\\
9 - That being said, I do envy what you guys have.\\
10 - You guys are like termites.\\
11 - - Termites? - Yeah.\\
12 - They mate for life, and once they live\\
13 - in your house, you can never get rid of 'em.\\
14 - Just like Alan.\\
15 - You alright?\\
16 - Yeah, I..\\
17 - ...I have to do something with him tonight\\
18 - that's going to be really painful.\\
19 - Okay, that's between two consenting adults.\\
20 - No.\\
21 - I'm breaking up with him.\\
22 - What?\\
23 - But you guys are great together.\\
24 - You're so beautiful\\
25 - and smart and fun.\\
26 - And Alan's so..\\
27 - ...lucky.\\
28 - I don't want to hurt him.\\
29 - Then do something else.\\
30 - Disneyland, dancing, bowling\\
31 - pretty much anything but break up with him.\\
32 - I have to.\\
33 - But you and I are his world.\\
34 - And if you leave, I'll be his world.\\
35 - I'm sorry.\\
36 - No, I don't think you heard me.\\
37 - I'll be his world!\\
38 - I feel so bad.\\
39 - Alright. Come here.\\
40 - This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do.\\
41 - And I pushed a baby out of my vagina.\\
42 - [Alan] 'I'm back!'\\
43 - Don't say anything.\\
44 - Oh. Hey, Walden. Want to join us?\\
45 - Uh...no, thanks.\\
46 - Hey, what do you say we all go bowling?\\
47 - 'Huh?'\\
48 - Doesn't that sound fun? Just bowling?\\
49 - No, I, I think we're just gonna stay in tonight.\\
50 - Uh, oh, but I have a confession to make.\\
51 - I, uh, opened my fortune cookie in the car..\\
52 - ...and listen to this.\\
53 - Uh..."Your life is about to take a turn for the better."\\
54 - I think you may have gotten Lyndsey's cookie.\\
55 -     Men men men men    \\
56 -     Manly men men men    \\
57 -     Men men men men        Oo-o-o-o-h    \\
58 -     Manly men men men    \\
59 -     Men men men men manly men    \\
60 -     Ooh hoo hoo, ooh ooh ooh ooh    \\
61 -     Men men men men    \\
62 -     Manly men men men    \\
63 -     Men men men men    \\
64 -     Manly men men men    \\
65 -     Men       \\
66 -     Men       \\
67 - Would you like another glass of wi--\\
68 - Yes.\\
69 - Oh, you know, I was thinking, uh\\
70 - after dinner we could light a fire.\\
71 - Don't worry, I've got all the wood we'll need.\\
72 - Cute.\\
73 - Uh, you seem awfully quiet tonight.\\
74 - Is everything okay?\\
75 - I-I've just got a lot on my mind.\\
76 - Hmm, what is it, sweetie?\\
77 - Oh, boy.\\
78 - I don't know how to say this.\\
79 - Well, a problem shared is a problem halved.\\
80 - It's kind of like that fried rice\\
81 - although I noticed you didn't touch your half\\
82 - despite the fact that you had to order it\\
83 - even though the white rice was free\\
84 - and the coupon specifically said "No substitutions."\\
85 - I think we should break up.\\
86 - Excuse me.\\
87 - Are you okay?\\
88 - You owe me $22.50 for dinner.\\
89 - - Hey, Berta. - Just finishing up.\\
90 - Then I'll get out of your way.\\
91 - No, I think you should stay here.\\
92 - Alright.\\
93 - Let me take a quick shower first.\\
94 - Lyndsey's downstairs breaking up with Alan.\\
95 - - Really? - Yeah.\\
96 - Well, we knew this was coming.\\
97 - First time I saw them together\\
98 - I asked her to blink twice if she was being held hostage.\\
99 - He's gonna be devastated.\\
100 - I mean, he's madly in love with her\\
101 - they've been dating for years.\\
102 - They were planning on getting married.\\
103 - Oh, my God, he's never gonna leave my house.\\
104 - It's sweet that you actually thought he was going to.\\
105 - Why do people have to break up?\\
106 - Well, in my experience\\
107 - either the magic wears off, or the mushrooms.\\
108 - I feel really bad for him.\\
109 - I mean, I always feel bad for him.\\
110 - But I feel reallybad for him.\\
111 - Yeah, yeah. It's tough.\\
112 - We gonna do this thing or what?\\
113 - I don't understand. Where is this coming from?\\
114 - There's no spark anymore.\\
115 - All we do is sit around, watch TV and eat takeout\\
116 - from whatever restaurant you have a coupon for.\\
117 - Did you want to go to the food court?\\
118 - 'Cause we can do that.\\
119 - - Alan, it's not that. - Then, what is it?\\
120 - I mean, I-I-I thought you were happy.\\
121 - I-I thought everything was great.\\
122 - It was, but-but things change, people change.\\
123 - That's not true. I don't change. I never change.\\
124 - Maybe that's part of the problem.\\
125 - I can change.\\
126 - I-I know this is upsetting\\
127 - but-but better to do this now before it gets worse.\\
128 - How can it be worse?\\
129 - You gonna tell me you've been faking it all these years?\\
130 - Don't answer that.\\
131 - - Alan, I have to go. - Fine, go.\\
132 - Don't go.\\
133 - I am really sorry.\\
134 - The thing is I-I still love you, Alan.\\
135 - I'm just not in love with you anymore.\\
136 - It's not a deal-breaker.\\
137 -     Men       \\
138 - You okay?\\
139 - I guess.\\
140 - I suppose it's better that she broke up with me now\\
141 - than after we got married.\\
142 - Then she would've gotten half of all my stuff.\\
143 - Sure.\\
144 - You know, I'm here for you.\\
145 - I know that and, and I appreciate it.\\
146 - But...I'm good.\\
147 - Good.\\
148 - - Walden? - Yeah?\\
149 - I'm not good.\\
150 - I love her.\\
151 - I know you do.\\
152 - I'll never find another one like her.\\
153 - I know you won't.\\
154 - I'm-I'm just saying, I-I know how great she is.\\
155 - You're gonna be fine.\\
156 - You Just.. You have to focus on the good things in your life.\\
157 - Lyndsey was the only good thing in my life.\\
158 - - Oh, God.. - It's okay.\\
159 - [sobbing]\\
160 - Let it all out.\\
161 - [sobbing]\\
162 - That's a lot out. Let's-let's put some back in.\\
163 - Now you're all I have!\\
164 - [sobbing]\\
165 - [sobbing]\\
166 - I know.\\
167 -     Men       \\
168 - Good morning. Beautiful day.\\
169 - To...stick your head in an oven?\\
170 - Okay, I realize I was a little upset last night.\\
171 - A little? You googled\\
172 - "How to kill yourself without it hurting."\\
173 - Drama queen.\\
174 - But I woke up this morning\\
175 - and I realized, "What am I so upset about?"\\
176 - Lyndsey and I are not breaking up.\\
177 - Okay. So, when she said\\
178 - that she didn't want to see you anymore\\
179 - and she didn't think you made a good couple\\
180 - and she wasn't in love with you, that..\\
181 - What do you call that?\\
182 - Foreplay.\\
183 - Okay. Looks like someone's starting the day\\
184 - with a hot, steaming cup of denial.\\
185 - No, no, no. This is a little dance we do all the time.\\
186 - She decides that I did something wrong\\
187 - and gives me the business and then I apologize\\
188 - and I give her the business.\\
189 - Okay, see, that right there.\\
190 - That's why she broke up with you.\\
191 - I'm telling you, we are not broken up.\\
192 - Okay, I see what you're doing here.\\
193 - But pretending like what happened didn't happen\\
194 - won't make it not happen no matter what you would like\\
195 - to have had happened.\\
196 - Yeah, that's right.\\
197 - Well, thank you, I appreciate it.\\
198 - But if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get my girl back.\\
199 - Okay. Just in case, I'll preheat the oven.\\
200 -     Men       \\
201 - [doorbell rings]\\
202 - Alan? What are you doing here?\\
203 - What am I doing here?\\
204 - That's what I love about you.\\
205 - Okay, let's do this.\\
206 - I'm sorry.\\
207 - There's nothing to be sorry about.\\
208 - Our relationship just isn't going anywhere.\\
209 - Alright, alright. Message received, loud and clear.\\
210 - Now let's get down to bidness.\\
211 - Alan, it's over.\\
212 - But, but why?\\
213 - It-it just is.\\
214 - Is it because we don't like the same things?\\
215 - 'Cause I can learn to love sports.\\
216 - It has nothing to do with that.\\
217 - Is it because I'm-I'm frugal? Okay, watch this.\\
218 - I'm going to rip a twent-a five-dollar bill in half.\\
219 - Okay?\\
220 - Tell me that's not sexy.\\
221 - Okay, look..\\
222 - I didn't want to have to say this\\
223 - but the fact of the matter is..\\
224 - ...I've met someone else.\\
225 - Oh. Wow. Wow.\\
226 - Uh, world spinning, uh, gut tightening\\
227 - vomit rising, um..\\
228 - I'm really sorry.\\
229 - - Well, well, who is he? - What's the difference?\\
230 - Well, I-I need to know who my competition is.\\
231 - I-I need to know how I can win.\\
232 - You can't win. Goodbye, Alan.\\
233 - Well, I have got news for you.\\
234 - The word "win" is not in my vocabular..\\
235 - "Can't." The word "can't" is not in my vocabulary.\\
236 - Damn it.\\
237 - Ah! Son of a bitch!\\
238 - Aah! Ah!\\
239 - Oh!\\
240 - [Alan] 'Of course.'\\
241 - 'Dog crap.'\\
242 -     Men       \\
243 -     Men       \\
244 - Hey, there's soup on the stove if you want some.\\
245 - I wonder if Lyndsey's new boyfriend likes soup.\\
246 - He probably loves soup.\\
247 - And wears cable knit sweaters.\\
248 - "Look at me, I'm eating soup\\
249 - "and wearing a sweater while I bang the memory\\
250 - of Alan Harper out of this woman's mind."\\
251 - [laughing]\\
252 - - Alan, let it go. - You brought it up.\\
253 - I brought up soup.\\
254 - I can't stop thinking about him.\\
255 - And her. And what they're doing.\\
256 - And what position they're doing it in.\\
257 - And where they're doing it.\\
258 - In the bed, in the shower, at the Costco\\
259 - between the meat and the tires. That was our place!\\
260 - That shouldn't be anyone's place.\\
261 - - And you're obsessing. - No, I'm not.\\
262 - Right, we all picture our exes screw\\
263 - between a rump roast and a snow tire.\\
264 - You know what, I-I'm gonna go for a drive.\\
265 - - Where? - Just out, you know, joyride.\\
266 - I've seen your car, there's no joy in that ride.\\
267 - Now where are you going?\\
268 - I'm just gonna drive up the coast a little bit.\\
269 - Take in the sea air.\\
270 - How? Your windows don't roll down.\\
271 - Just the ones in the front. The ones in the back don't roll up.\\
272 - Goodbye.\\
273 - I should buy him a new car.\\
274 - So he can live in it.\\
275 -     Men       \\
276 - Alright. Where are they?\\
277 - They're probably watching sports right now.\\
278 - "Hello, Lyndsey, you don't mind if I watch\\
279 - this baseball game in the nude, do you?"\\
280 - "Sure, you can kiss me between the strikes\\
281 - and I'll kiss you between the balls."\\
282 - [cell phone ringing]\\
283 - Oh.\\
284 - Hey, Walden.\\
285 - Yeah, I'm just, uh, you know, taking a drive\\
286 - down the Malibu coast, trying to clear my head.\\
287 - Yeah, now I'm, uh, I'm walking on the beach.\\
288 - Sand feels nice on my toesies.\\
289 - Whoa!\\
290 - Walking on the beach, huh?\\
291 - - Are you stalking me? - Are you stalking Lyndsey?\\
292 - I asked you first.\\
293 - Look, this is pathetic.\\
294 - Sitting outside a woman's house\\
295 - trying to catch of glimpse of her through the window.\\
296 - What kind of person does that?\\
297 - [knock on window]\\
298 - [both gasping]\\
299 - Hey, guys, what are we doing?\\
300 - Playing a little peek-a-boo with Lyndsey?\\
301 - No.\\
302 - Yes.\\
303 - Lyndsey broke up with Alan\\
304 - and he's having a hard time understanding.\\
305 - Oh, well, one look at the new guy\\
306 - and you'd understand it.\\
307 - - What, you've seen him? - Oh, yeah. Nick's gorgeous.\\
308 - - Kind of looks like Walden. - Aw, thank you.\\
309 - Y-you know his name, so you-you've met him?\\
310 - Well, no, but I've heard her yell it.\\
311 - It's either "Nick" or "Oh-God-Right-There."\\
312 - Oh, that's it.\\
313 - I got to see this Nick guy for myself.\\
314 - No, Alan, don't.\\
315 - You're better than this.\\
316 - [Alan] 'We both know that's not true!'\\
317 - Yeah, I feel for him. It's got to be tough.\\
318 - Yeah, no doubt.\\
319 - You really are a very handsome man.\\
320 - Again, thank you.\\
321 - It's not hard to imagine you naked and cast in marble.\\
322 - Getting weird, Herb.\\
323 - Right.\\
324 -     Men       \\
325 - Alright.\\
326 - Where are you, you home-wrecker?\\
327 - Oh!\\
328 - That's better.\\
329 - [hooting]\\
330 - Ugh. Aah!\\
331 - [Alan] 'Can this get any worse?'\\
332 - [Lyndsey] 'Oh, God, Nick, right there!'\\
333 - [Alan] 'Aw.'\\
334 -     Men       \\
335 - [beeping]\\
336 - Lyndsey, hey!\\
337 - Hey, I need your help.\\
338 - You need my help getting back together with Alan?\\
339 - No. I need you to tell him to stop calling, e-mailing\\
340 - and texting me. Words and pictures.\\
341 - Especially the pictures.\\
342 - He's just upset. He means well.\\
343 - Really? Does this picture look like he means well?\\
344 - Oh, dear God.\\
345 - Is he lying on my kitchen table?\\
346 - So, will you talk to him?\\
347 - Sure, right after I burn my kitchen table.\\
348 - Thank you. By the way, you might want to burn your bathtub too.\\
349 - Oh, he's coming now. Got to go.\\
350 - [groaning]\\
351 - Hey. There he is.\\
352 - Looking good.\\
353 - Ha-ha.\\
354 - [grunting]\\
355 - Where you going?\\
356 - Lyndsey un-friended me on Facebook.\\
357 - So I'm gonna go re-friend her with my face.\\
358 - No, you're not.\\
359 - You can't stop me.\\
360 - Damn you.\\
361 - [instrumental music]\\
362 -     Men       \\
363 - [knock on door]\\
364 - - Hey, Zip. - Oh, what do you want?\\
365 - A motorcycle and another night with Neil Diamond.\\
366 - But for now, we need to talk.\\
367 - I just want to be left alone.\\
368 - Like I'm gonna be for the rest of my life.\\
369 - Look, Lyndsey's crazy for breaking up with you.\\
370 - - You are a great guy. - You're just saying that.\\
371 - I know I'm rough on you, but that's just for fun.\\
372 - I really mean this.\\
373 - Oh, thank you.\\
374 - Alright, good talk.\\
375 - - How? - What?\\
376 - How am I a great guy?\\
377 - [sighs]\\
378 - Well, you're punctual.\\
379 - I-I do make it a priority to be on time.\\
380 - - Yep. - What else?\\
381 - [sighs]\\
382 - Okay.\\
383 - You have pretty good toilet aim.\\
384 - And that's important to a housekeeper.\\
385 - My secret is, I sit down.\\
386 - And that should've stayed a secret.\\
387 - Take care.\\
388 - Berta?\\
389 - What?\\
390 - I-i-if I'm such a great guy\\
391 - then why did Lyndsey leave me?\\
392 - Oh, there's no telling with chicks.\\
393 - But don't worry. You'll find somebody else.\\
394 - As good as Lyndsey?\\
395 - [laughing]\\
396 - Look at you, already making jokes.\\
397 - - How'd it go? - He's gonna die alone.\\
398 - And he pees sitting down.\\
399 -     Men       \\
400 - I really don't want to be here, Walden.\\
401 - What are you talking about?\\
402 - You're doing great.\\
403 - You shaved, you showered.\\
404 - You realized wearing Lyndsey's underwear\\
405 - wasn't a long-term solution.\\
406 - I may have it together on the outside\\
407 - but on the inside, I'm still a wreck.\\
408 - I just want to go home and eat ice cream on the toilet\\
409 - until I fall asleep.\\
410 - Would you listen to yourself?\\
411 - Trust me, tonight is gonna be fun.\\
412 - Okay. But if it's not, you're gonna have to watch\\
413 - "The Notebook" with me.\\
414 - Really? Again?\\
415 - [Allie] 'Walden.'\\
416 - Oh, hey, Allie, hi.\\
417 - This is, uh, my friend Alan I was telling you about.\\
418 - - Hi, Alan. - Hello.\\
419 - You two have a lot in common.\\
420 - Really?\\
421 - You know your girlfriend's new boyfriend, Nick?\\
422 - Yeah.\\
423 - I'm his soon-to-be ex-wife.\\
424 - I'll just let you two talk.\\
425 - Oh, oh. You know, I-I can see what Walden's trying to do here\\
426 - and he means well, but, um, I-I don't know\\
427 - that I'm emotionally ready to jump back into the relation--\\
428 - How do you feel about revenge sex?\\
429 - Big fan. I'll get the check.\\
430 -     Men       \\
431 -     Men       \\
432 - Well, well, well.\\
433 - Look who's doing the walk of shame.\\
434 - More like the stride of pride.\\
435 - Guess who heard, oh, God, right there\\
436 - multiple times last night?\\
437 - Not Nick.\\
438 - Well, congratulations. I'm very happy for you.\\
439 - I have you to thank you for it.\\
440 - Ah, I didn't do anything.\\
441 - Tracking Allie down couldn't have been easy.\\
442 - It wasn't that hard.\\
443 - When we were outside Lyndsey's house\\
444 - she was parked right behind us.\\
445 - Which is ironic, because last night I was parked--\\
446 - Alright, alright, I got it, I got it.\\
447 - I'm happy you're feeling better.\\
448 - Oh, yeah.\\
449 - And let me tell you, revenge sex is way better\\
450 - than revenge masturbation.\\
451 - Course, there's no reason you can't do both.\\
452 - Oh, God, why am I eating on this table?\\
453 -     Men       \\
454 -     Men men men men    \\

\subsection {Episode 22: My Bodacious Vidalia}
1 - You seem awfully quiet tonight. Is everything okay?\\
2 - I-I've just got a lot on my mind.\\
3 - Well, a problem shared is a problem halved.\\
4 - I think we should break up.\\
5 - Lyndsey's downstairs breaking up with Alan.\\
6 - - Really? - He's gonna be devastated.\\
7 - He was madly in love with her. They've been dating for years.\\
8 - They were planning on getting married.\\
9 - I-I still love you, Alan.\\
10 - I'm just not in love with you anymore.\\
11 - - Hey, Zip. - Just wanna be left alone.\\
12 - Lyndsey's crazy for breaking up with you.\\
13 - - You are a great guy. - Thank you.\\
14 - You'll find somebody else.\\
15 - As good as Lyndsey?\\
16 - Look at you, already making jokes.\\
17 -     Men       \\
18 - Hey. What you doing?\\
19 - Oh, just taking a stroll down memory lane.\\
20 - It's a photo book that Lyndsey gave me.\\
21 - Oh. Here we are at the Santa Monica Pier.\\
22 - [imitating Lyndsey] "Oh, Alan, I'm having such a great time.\\
23 - "I know it looks like I'm eating cotton candy\\
24 - "but really I'm just waiting for someone better to come along\\
25 - so I can dump your sorry ass."\\
26 - That dude in the Speedo totally photo-bombed you.\\
27 - Bet she was sleepin' with him, too.\\
28 - And look at the guy with the churros.\\
29 - What's he smilin' about?\\
30 - Okay, you know what? You can't live in the past.\\
31 - You also can't live in this robe.\\
32 - It's like the sacred shroud of urine.\\
33 - What happened?\\
34 - Lyndsey and I were supposed to take care\\
35 - of each other for the rest of our lives.\\
36 - She'd blend my steak so I didn't have to gum it.\\
37 - I'd change the tennis balls on the bottom of her walker.\\
38 - We'd keep track of each other's moles.\\
39 - It's a romantic picture.\\
40 - Glad you think so.\\
41 - 'Cause now that's just gonna be you and me.\\
42 - It's not gonna be you and me\\
43 - because A, no.\\
44 - And B, you're gonna find somebody new.\\
45 - You just have to have a positive attitude.\\
46 - If you say you can't, you're right.\\
47 - If you say you can, you might.\\
48 - [blows raspberry]\\
49 - Do that again.\\
50 - [blows raspberry] Ow!\\
51 - - Ow! - Now, suck it up!\\
52 - You're gonna find somebody new!\\
53 - - I can't. - Why not?\\
54 - Look at me!\\
55 - [mumbles]\\
56 - - What? - Look at me.\\
57 - When I met Lyndsey, I was a solid six.\\
58 - Now I'm a soft four at best.\\
59 - Really? You thought you were a six?\\
60 - Well, maybe not a Malibu six, but a Wal-Mart six.\\
61 - And it didn't matter. I was in love.\\
62 - No one takes care of themselves when they're in love.\\
63 - When you know you can have sex in a sweatshirt\\
64 - you stop doing sit-ups.\\
65 - Do something about it.\\
66 - Get yourself back in shape, get some new clothes\\
67 - get a haircut, get your own place.\\
68 - Anything to get your confidence back.\\
69 - Look, I appreciate the pep talk, but I've lost all hope.\\
70 - Well, I can't give you hope\\
71 - but I-I can give you my American Express Black Card.\\
72 - Hope's for losers.\\

85 - [beeping]\\
86 - Oh, hey, Walden.\\
87 - Hey, Jake, what's going on?\\
88 - I was just calling my dad back.\\
89 - He left me a voice mail.\\
90 - At least, I think it was him.\\
91 - It was just, like, two minutes of someone sobbing\\
92 - and then throwing up.\\
93 - Yeah, that was him.\\
94 - How often does he cry?\\
95 - It'd be quicker to tell you how often he doesn't.\\
96 - He's gonna be okay, right?\\
97 - Yeah, he actually got dressed today and left the house.\\
98 - And-and-and he even put on deodorant.\\
99 - Well, I-I actually put it on him, but he let me\\
100 - so...that's progress.\\
101 - I'm so glad that you're there for my dad.\\
102 - You're like the son he never had.\\
103 - Right.\\
104 - Okay, so I'm gonna get goin'.\\
105 - Yeah, yeah, me, too. I got to go run some black ops\\
106 - and test some ballistic weapons.\\
107 - Really? That-that sounds awesome.\\
108 - No, I'm just messing with you.\\
109 - I'm gonna go get high and make, like, 800 cupcakes.\\
110 - Sleep well, America.\\
111 - Ta-da!\\
112 - Wow!\\
113 - Wow!\\
114 - You look..\\
115 - Look at you.\\
116 - This is your vision, my friend.\\
117 - Oh, no, I could not envision this.\\
118 - You were right. It's time for me to get back to living life.\\
119 - Uh, check out my sweet onion.\\
120 - My bodacious Vidalia.\\
121 - Wow. How did you pack all of you in there?\\
122 - Ah, well, uh, I guess I would have to say\\
123 - it's...Spanx to these.\\
124 - Is that a girdle?\\
125 - Oh, no. Uh, it's a-a male sport control top.\\
126 - It's for athletes.\\
127 - Athletes with man boobs.\\
128 - Not anymore.\\
129 - Uh, Heather, the salesgirl, said I look like a DILD.\\
130 - Oh?\\
131 - It stands for "Dad I'd Like to Do."\\
132 - Okay. Let's-let's talk about that hair.\\
133 - Walk me through that.\\
134 - Oh, uh, a-a young man named Juan did this to me.\\
135 - Um, uh, he does Justin Bieber's hair.\\
136 - - Oh, wow, that's lucky. - I-I know.\\
137 - Can't believe Justin Bieber goes to Supercuts.\\
138 - Driving home, you can't imagine\\
139 - how many people were checking me out.\\
140 - Oh, I can imagine.\\
141 - What do you say we go someplace and try out my new look?\\
142 - I wanna get my groove on with the hip, funky people.\\
143 - Okay, yeah, I'll see if I can fire up the time machine\\
144 - and we'll head back to 1974.\\
145 - I'll, uh, I'll put my stuff away.\\
146 - - Uh, Alan? - Yeah?\\
147 - - My credit card? - Oh, uh, right.\\
148 - Release.\\
149 - I'm tryin'.\\
150 -     Men       \\
151 - [instrumental music]\\
152 - Wow.\\
153 - I'm seein' your hairdo everywhere I look.\\
154 - Best ten bucks I ever spent.\\
155 - I wish I had my deck of cards.\\
156 - Deck of cards?\\
157 - Oh, yeah. Close-up magic is a great icebreaker\\
158 - with the ladies.\\
159 - What is wrong with you?\\
160 - What is wrong with you\\
161 - that you have a quarter in your ear?\\
162 - Give me that.\\
163 - Come on. You're a charming guy.\\
164 - Just be yourself, stick to your strengths.\\
165 - I-I'm sorry. I-I can't hear you.\\
166 - I have a quarter in my ear--\\
167 - Will you stop that?\\
168 - What about her? Go buy her a drink.\\
169 - She's a little out of my league, isn't she?\\
170 - You're not even playing the same sport.\\
171 - Just go say hi.\\
172 - Okay, here goes.\\
173 - Uh, hi. Can I buy you a drink?\\
174 - Uh, no, thanks. I already have one.\\
175 - Uh, can I reimburse you for that one?\\
176 - Excuse me?\\
177 - Well, I would have happily bought you a drink\\
178 - if I had arrived a few moments earlier.\\
179 - Tell you what. Let me just give you some cash.\\
180 - You're kidding, right?\\
181 - Uh, here's a ten. Do you have change?\\
182 - What is wrong with you?\\
183 - Well, I'm not gonna tip you.\\
184 - That was weird.\\
185 - Yeah, she's the weird one.\\
186 - Maybe we should just go home.\\
187 - You're just a little rusty.\\
188 - Let me help you out.\\
189 - Hi.\\
190 - Well, hello.\\
191 - Yeah, before we go any further, I should warn you\\
192 - that I suffered from a horrific industrial accident\\
193 - down there.\\
194 - Oh, no.\\
195 - Oh, yes.\\
196 - Here. Say hi to my friend Alan.\\
197 - How bad was the accident?\\
198 - Say hi.\\
199 - Uh, hi. Uh, I'm Alan.\\
200 - I'm a back doctor\\
201 - but that doesn't mean I can't check out your front.\\
202 - Oh, my God.\\
203 - That is hilarious!\\
204 - You're so funny.\\
205 - [laughing]\\
206 - Oh, my God.\\
207 - - Um, I have a question for you. - Yeah?\\
208 - How did you get this quarter in your ear?\\
209 - How did you do that?\\
210 - Pull something else out of me!\\
211 - I like her.\\
212 - Oh, my God!\\
213 - Excuse me. How did you get this quarter in your ear?\\
214 -     Men       \\
215 - Wow.\\
216 - This is quite a place.\\
217 - Thank you.\\
218 - Looks like Elton John went on safari.\\
219 - Oh, uh, nice eagle.\\
220 - It's, uh, very realistic.\\
221 - I wanna feed it a bronze mouse.\\
222 - I can't believe you live here all by yours..\\
223 - "Sabado Gigante."\\
224 - - You like? - Oh, yeah.\\
225 - The hair on my head isn't the only thing standing up.\\
226 - Well, now it's your turn.\\
227 - Can't wait to get my hands on that tight, little body.\\
228 - Oh, uh, can I just freshen up a little?\\
229 - Down the hall to the left.\\
230 - I'll be waiting.\\
231 - [growls]\\
232 - [imitating dolphin's squeak]\\
233 - [grunts]\\
234 - [groaning]\\
235 - You've got to be kidding me.\\
236 - [grunts]\\
237 - [panting]\\
238 - No.\\
239 - [panting]\\
240 - Really?\\
241 - Hurry up or she's gonna think you're pooping.\\
242 -     Men       \\
243 - Hello?\\
244 - - Hello? - In here.\\
245 - Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!\\
246 - Oh, boy!\\
247 - Um, hi.\\
248 - Oh, sorry. I just gotta take care of something here.\\
249 - Did you gain weight?\\
250 - Oh. No, uh, this is water weight.\\
251 - Uh, too much salt.\\
252 - So, uh, who-who is this? Your grandpa?\\
253 - - No, he's my husband. - Your-your husband?\\
254 - Oh, don't worry. He doesn't even know we're here.\\
255 - Well, maybe not, but I am not the kind of man who..\\
256 - ...can pass up an opportunity like this.\\
257 - Hold on.\\
258 - You have a lovely home.\\
259 -     Men       \\
260 -     Men       \\
261 - [Alan] 'Morning.'\\
262 - Oh, Zippy, like it wasn't easy enough before.\\
263 - I wouldn't expect you to understand European chic.\\
264 - Looks more like you're a-peein' on a power line.\\
265 - Nice.\\
266 - Hey, tell me about that girl last night.\\
267 - - Uh, well, she's a vegetarian. - Yeah.\\
268 - And her husband's a vegetable.\\
269 - What?\\
270 - She's married\\
271 - and-and the guy's, like, 900 years old.\\
272 - - You're kidding. - She hot?\\
273 - Yeah.\\
274 - - He rich? - Mm-hmm.\\
275 - Checks out.\\
276 - So, how old is this guy?\\
277 - Uh, well, let me put it this way.\\
278 - He was one of the original investors in apple.\\
279 - The fruit.\\
280 - Well, I'm sorry it didn't work out, man.\\
281 - No, it worked out.\\
282 - - You didn't. - What do you want from me?\\
283 - He was in a coma and she was in a teddy.\\
284 - Alan, you surprise me.\\
285 - I thought you had more integrity than that.\\
286 - Where in the hell have you been?\\
287 -     Men       \\
288 - You know what? You know what? Can we just stop for a second?\\
289 - What's wrong?\\
290 - You don't know me well\\
291 - but I happen to be a man of great integrity.\\
292 - And it's hard for me to do this\\
293 - knowing your husband is right next door.\\
294 - You want me to put him in a cab for a couple hours?\\
295 - I-I don't think that's gonna help.\\
296 - Look, I know I'm technically taken.\\
297 - But you have to understand\\
298 - Victor was 80 when I married him.\\
299 - And now, 12 years later, he's still alive\\
300 - and we're both using machines to get us through the night.\\
301 - Well, how did you two even meet?\\
302 - I was on a pole, he was in a wheelchair.\\
303 - Our eyes met, and when I turned right side up\\
304 - I knew he was the one.\\
305 - That's-that's very...romantic.\\
306 - I can't expect you to understand what it's like\\
307 - to rely on someone to put a roof over your head\\
308 - and provide you with the luxurious life you deserve.\\
309 - Oh, my God, we're soul mates.\\
310 -     Men       \\
311 - [doorbell rings]\\
312 - I got it. It's for me.\\
313 - Surprise!\\
314 - Y-you brought your husband.\\
315 - It's our anniversary.\\
316 - It didn't seem right to leave him alone.\\
317 - Uh, well, this doesn't seem better.\\
318 - Uh, but come on in.\\
319 - Um, uh, Meghan, you remember Walden.\\
320 - Walden, this is Meghan's husband, Victor.\\
321 - It's their anniversary.\\
322 - Hi, Victor. It's nice to meet you.\\
323 - Yeah, this is normal.\\
324 - Can you give me a hand?\\
325 - I'm just gonna wheel him on to the deck.\\
326 - Oh, uh, sure. No problem.\\
327 - Oh, look, Victor! The ocean!\\
328 - You remember it from when you discovered America.\\
329 - That's-that's a good one\\
330 - but technically Columbus didn't actually--\\
331 - - Shut up. - Right.\\
332 - Do you-do you think we should get them a cake?\\
333 - Look at him. He is a cake.\\
334 - Right. Pl-Plus, we don't want to get him all hopped up on sugar.\\
335 - Come here.\\
336 - There are a billion women in this world. Why this one?\\
337 - I don't know. She's like a-a powerful sex magnet.\\
338 - And I'm like a...sex refrigerator.\\
339 - What does that even mean?\\
340 - I have no idea what it means.\\
341 - I-I need you to babysit her decomposing husband\\
342 - while I plow his wife.\\
343 - It's their anniversary.\\
344 -     Men       \\
345 - Oh, come on.\\
346 - Looks like you...found a new friend, Vic.\\
347 - Can I call you Vic?\\
348 - I'm gonna call you Vic.\\
349 - [sighs]\\
350 - Is this what I have to look forward to, Vic?\\
351 - You live your life, you try to be a good person\\
352 - you work hard to achieve your goals\\
353 - only to end up a prisoner to your own body\\
354 - while the love of your life is in the next room\\
355 - doing the splits for some idiot she met in a bar.\\
356 - If this is it, just kill me now.\\
357 - [beeping]\\
358 - Vic?\\
359 - Vic!\\
360 - Aw, come on!\\
361 - Alan!\\
362 - [Alan] 'Bad time, Walden!'\\
363 - It's even worse out here! Open the door.\\
364 - What could be so important?\\
365 - I'm pretty sure that your girlfriend's husband is dead.\\
366 - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.\\
367 - She's not my girlfriend.\\
368 - No, no, no. He can't die here.\\
369 - Think he already did.\\
370 - No, you don't understand. He can't die here.\\
371 - I have an infidelity clause in my prenup.\\
372 - If his greedy 70-year-old kids find out that I was here\\
373 - they'll take all my money.\\
374 - Are you kidding? Your money?\\
375 - Well, in all fairness, she did earn it the old-fashioned way.\\
376 - Well, thank you, Alan. Show a little respect.\\
377 - Now stuff him in the car while I go find my panties.\\
378 - Look what you did. You got my girlfriend upset.\\
379 - I thought she wasn't your girlfriend.\\
380 - She's gonna inherit millions of dollars.\\
381 - She's my girlfriend.\\
382 -     Men       \\
383 - Okay, when we get there, we'll put him in his bed\\
384 - you guys leave and I'll call 911.\\
385 - Don't worry, sweetheart, after the funeral\\
386 - we'll go someplace warm and beautiful where we can heal.\\
387 - And tan.\\
388 - And swim with the dolphins. Ee-ee, ee-ee!\\
389 - You two dreamers do realize\\
390 - that what we're doing right now is a felony.\\
391 - I-I realize and I owe you one.\\
392 - One? Seriously? One?\\
393 - I want ice cream!\\
394 - [all screaming]\\
395 -     Men       \\
396 -     Men       \\
397 - I can't believe you found a quarter down there.\\
398 - And if you look closely, George is smiling.\\
399 - Why don't I get us some champagne?\\
400 - Oh, yes.\\
401 - Champagne makes me do crazy things.\\
402 - Well, that's good 'cause..\\
403 - Crazy. Thing.\\

62 - Some families hand down recipes.\\

66 - They're amazing. Who took these?\\
67 - Oh, I did.\\

69 - In fact, this is pretty much a record\\
70 - of the last 40 years of my life.\\
71 - Well, hold on, in this one, these guys are aiming\\
72 - their machine guns at the camera\\
73 - which means, they're aiming their machine guns at you.\\

126 - Strom Thurmond's hand is on my ass.\\
127 - So, what did you do?\\
128 - I became a lifelong Democrat.\\
129 - Wow. You've seen some incredible things.\\
130 - Oh, well, you can get into some pretty amazing places\\
131 - with a camera, a press pass and no bra.\\
132 - Okay, I'm gonna stop wearing a bra.\\
133 - It's-it's nice to have someone to talk to.\\
134 - Stacey thinks Nicaragua is a gum you chew to stop smoking.\\
135 - She also thinks Mount Rushmore is a natural phenomenon.\\
136 - It's not?\\
137 - Oh, man. I should really get going.\\
138 - Oh, but before you go, you have to do something for me.\\
139 - Every person I meet poses for the same picture.\\
140 - Oh, I would be honored.\\
141 - Great. Okay, now, stand by that wall.\\
142 - - Okay. - Yeah.\\

153 - - Hey. - Hey, Walden.\\
154 - - What are you doing home? - Oh, just visiting.\\
155 - He's being transferred to Japan.\\
156 - Oh, what? That's amazing!\\
157 - I mean, I'll miss you, but what a great opportunity.\\
158 - It's a beautiful country, gorgeous women, one step closer\\
159 - to having this house to myself.\\
160 - Yeah, the only thing I'm worried about\\
161 - is, they still haven't found Godzilla.\\
162 - - How-how was the party? - Oh, it was great.\\
163 - I-I met this really hot 22-year-old girl\\
164 - and spent the whole night talking to her grandma.\\
165 - Oh, yeah, "Talking to her grandma."\\
166 - I know what that means.\\
167 - - Do you? - Are you kidding?\\
168 - Whenever I wear my uniform out\\
169 - all the ladies let me talk to their grandma.\\
170 - - I'm just gonna talk to you. - Wait, wait.\\
171 - So, uh, you-you met this hot 22-year-old\\
172 - but you spent the night talking to her grandmother?\\
173 - That's like going to the International House of Pancakes\\
174 - and ordering a bowl of dust.\\
175 - Clearly, I can't talk to either of you.\\
176 - No. No, seriously. Why?\\
177 - Well, I'm sick of dating these goofy, shallow girls\\
178 - that all have a tiny dog in their purse.\\
179 - Alright, tiny dog in their purse.\\
180 - I'm missing you less and less.\\
181 - She's really interesting.\\
182 - Is she like a rapping granny or something?\\
183 - Stop talking!\\
184 - Well, she's smart and funny\\
185 - and she's had all these incredible experiences.\\
186 - There's just one problem.\\
187 - What? She can't drive at night?\\
188 - No.\\
189 - If I want to see Linda again\\
190 - and I got to see Stacey again\\
191 - and if, if I see her, she's gonna want to have sex with me.\\
192 - Could you ask Walden why that's a problem?\\
193 -     Men       \\
194 - This is nice, huh?\\
195 - Yes, it is.\\
196 - In a truly weird way.\\
197 - There's nothing weird about\\
198 - three people having dinner together.\\
199 - It is when two of them are on a date.\\
200 - Oh, come on. We want you here. Isn't that right, Stacey?\\
201 - Huh? Yeah. Totes.\\
202 - Well, in that case, I'm totes glad to be here.\\
203 - So, are-are you into photography, too?\\
204 - Oh, yeah, I take tons of selfies!\\
205 - Instagram! Hmm.\\
206 - So, how did you two wind up living together?\\
207 - Ugh. She's my grandma.\\
208 - Duh!\\
209 - Stacey's looking for a job out here.\\
210 - She just graduated from Arizona State.\\
211 - Oh, wow!\\
212 - - What was your major? - Communications.\\
213 - You know, I've always wondered what is that exactly?\\
214 - Well..\\
215 - ...it's kind of hard to put into words.\\
216 - I mean, you know, it's, like, talking and stuff.\\
217 - - Uh-huh. - Hundred and twenty grand.\\
218 - Ooh, hey, are we gonna have sex tonight?\\
219 - There's that communications degree at work.\\
220 - I hadn't really thought--.\\
221 - 'Cause, if not.\\
222 - I just got invited to a killer party.\\
223 - Well, I-I wouldn't want to keep you--\\
224 - Great, my friends are gonna swing by and pick me up.\\
225 - Do-do you want to eat something first?\\
226 - Oh, God, no. I hate drinking on a full stomach.\\
227 - In fact, I'm gonna go throw up and make a little room.\\
228 - Pretty sure she's going to live with me forever.\\
229 - I got one of those.\\
230 -     Men       \\
231 - I think pizza's the thing\\
232 - I'm gonna miss the most when I go to Japan.\\
233 - - Really? Pizza? - Yeah.\\
234 - Well, that and sushi.\\
235 - Okay.\\
236 - You know what? This is ridiculous.\\
237 - I mean, you're-you're gonna be gone for a year\\
238 - and we're sitting here watching\\
239 - Dancing with the Freakin' Stars.\\
240 - Well, do you want to watch "Hillbilly Gynecologist?"\\
241 - No. No, I don't want to watch anything.\\
242 - I want to do something.\\
243 - Hey, hey, what do you say we go on a father-son road trip?\\
244 - - Okay. Can we go to Vegas? - Uh, well, that would be great.\\
245 - Except you're not old enough to drink or gamble.\\
246 - Right. I don't drink.\\
247 - Oh, uh, you know what we could do?\\
248 - We could see beloved Canadian songbird Celine Dion.\\
249 - She is to die for.\\
250 - - Dad. - Mm-hmm.\\
251 - I'm gonna be going away for a while.\\
252 - If there's anything you need to tell me, now's the time.\\
253 -     Men       \\
254 - Well, thank you very much for dinner.\\
255 - You know, I was really impressed that you ordered in Italian.\\
256 - Grazie, signora. Molto bene.\\
257 - It would've been more impressive if we'd been\\
258 - in an Italian restaurant.\\
259 - - I had a great time tonight. - Oh, I did, too. Yeah.\\
260 - Whoa!\\
261 - Look. You are a wonderful young man, but I have a rule.\\
262 - I never kiss anyone who started the night\\
263 - on a date with my granddaughter.\\
264 - Rule? This has happened before?\\
265 -     Men       \\
266 -     Men       \\
267 - So, what do you think?\\
268 - If we take this route\\
269 - we can be at the Grand Canyon by sunrise tomorrow.\\
270 - - Pretty awesome, huh? - Yeah.\\
271 - You know what else is awesome? The Bunny Ranch.\\
272 - We're not going to a whorehouse, we're going to the Grand Canyon.\\
273 - There's a girl at the Bunny Ranch\\
274 - they call the Grand Canyon.\\
275 - Mornin'.\\
276 - Hey, Walden, we're going on a father-son trip.\\
277 - - Do you want to come? - Jake?\\
278 - What I want it to be fun.\\
279 - I can't, I'm still sorting things out\\
280 - with Linda and Stacey.\\
281 - Oh, right. The grandma- granddaughter thing.\\
282 - You know, if you get the mom in there\\
283 - they'll bronze your Johnson.\\
284 - I am so glad you're a cook, not a sniper.\\
285 - - So, Japan, huh? - Yeah, the Big Apple.\\
286 - Have a fun road trip.\\
287 - I'm gonna miss this. Give me a hug.\\
288 - Oh, thanks for everything, Berta.\\
289 - You take care of yourself, Taterhead.\\
290 - - Are you crying? - Nah!\\
291 - Oh, don't worry, you'll still have my dad.\\
292 - Now, I'm crying.\\
293 -     Men       \\
294 - [doorbell rings]\\
295 - - Hi. - Hi. Um, hm.\\
296 - Well, this is a little awkward.\\
297 - Um, Stacey's actually out on a date.\\
298 - Oh, no. I'm devastated.\\
299 - I don't think I should be alone.\\
300 - Look, I'm very flattered\\
301 - but I think we covered this last night.\\
302 - I brought weed.\\
303 - Oh, honey, that's not weed.\\
304 - Come on in.\\
305 - And stop looking at my ass.\\
306 - Got it.\\
307 -     Men       \\
308 - Isn't this great? The Harper boys, on the road.\\
309 - Mothers, lock up your daughters.\\
310 - Cows, prepare to be tipped.\\
311 - Since when do you tip?\\
312 - That's witty banter. Best thing about a road trip.\\
313 - Yeah, yeah. That and joking around.\\
314 - - Can I tell you something? - Of course.\\
315 - Back when you and mom broke up, I thought it was your fault\\
316 - and I was kind of mad at you for a long time.\\
317 - Oh, Jake, well, it was very complicated.\\
318 - You know, a lot of things got said--\\
319 - Yeah, well, let me finish.\\
320 - Then mom married Herb and then broke up with him\\
321 - so now I'm thinking maybe it wasn't all you.\\
322 - Well, I appreciate that.\\
323 - But I'm not gonna say anything bad about your mother.\\
324 - - But you're hoping I will. - Oh, absolutely.\\
325 -     Men       \\
326 - So, after I dropped out of college, me and my buddy\\
327 - developed this software, and we sold it for\\
328 - like, a stupid amount of money.\\
329 - And I lost half of it in my divorce\\
330 - so then I developed some more software and made it all back\\
331 - and I am really freaking high.\\
332 - I feel like I've been talking for over a year.\\
333 - [sighs] You kind of have.\\
334 - So, what do you do now?\\
335 - A lot of this.\\
336 - Oh, Walden. You did your life backwards.\\
337 - Yeah. You're supposed to spend your youth ad-adventurizing.\\
338 - A-and then you go into business.\\
339 - Wait. You said "adventurizing."\\
340 - That's not even a word.\\
341 - It is now. I just inventorized it.\\
342 - No, I mean it. I mean it.\\
343 - You-you need to find something exciting in your life.\\
344 - Like what?\\
345 - Have you ever been chased by a lion in the Serengeti?\\
346 - No, but one time I got in a slap fight\\
347 - with the guy who plays Simba at Disneyland.\\
348 - That counts.\\
349 - H-have you ever been at a voodoo ritual in Haiti?\\
350 - Or-or-or panned for gold in the Yukon?\\
351 - Or made out with Buzz Aldrin?\\
352 - Ooh, do I want to make out with Buzz Aldrin?\\
353 - Oh, yeah.\\
354 - You need to find that thing in your life\\
355 - that you're afraid to do and then you just do it.\\
356 - - Yeah, maybe you're right. - Um.\\
357 - Oh, wow.\\
358 - I'm sorry.\\
359 - No, no, no. This is this one's on me.\\
360 - I'm...I haven't been with anybody\\
361 - since my divorce, and that was three years ago.\\
362 - Well, how is that possible? You're a beautiful woman.\\
363 - No, I was a mess, I-I was faithful to one man\\
364 - for over 30 years and unfortunately\\
365 - he was only faithful for six months and not in a row.\\
366 - Well, he is an idiot for philanderizing.\\
367 - What are you doing here, Walden?\\
368 - You're-you're handsome and young and rich\\
369 - and you know, you can have any woman you want.\\
370 - That is what I'm doing here.\\
371 - Oh, you're good.\\
372 - Like I said, I-I haven't been with anyone for a long time.\\
373 - I'll go slow.\\
374 - You misunderstand.\\
375 - I don't want to go slow.\\
376 - I want to hurt you.\\
377 -     Men       \\
378 - These are awesome.\\
379 - They're the last of the Charlie Harper Estate.\\
380 - We were supposed to smoke them when you graduated college.\\
381 - [laughing]\\
382 - I'm really glad we took this trip.\\
383 - Me, too.\\
384 - I can't believe my baby boy is all grown up\\
385 - and headed off to Japan.\\
386 - Well, tell him to look me up, 'cause I'll be there, too.\\
387 - I'm kidding, I'm kidding.\\
388 - I'm gonna worry about you every day you're over there.\\
389 - Don't worry about me. Worry about the Japanese.\\
390 - - Kidding? - Huh? What?\\
391 - Hey, I, uh I got you a little something.\\
392 - Whoa. This is a lot of cash.\\
393 - Did you rob the 7-11 we stopped at?\\
394 - More like they robbed me.\\
395 - Six dollars for a Slim Jim and a Yoo-hoo? Come on.\\
396 - No, I've been putting a little something away here and there.\\
397 - Wow. Thanks.\\
398 - Wish there was more.\\
399 - I'm just surprised that there's any.\\
400 - Okay, I-I deserve that. I-I know I wasn't the best dad.\\
401 - Are you kidding?\\
402 - We lived at a beach house\\
403 - my whole life, rent-free.\\
404 - And then, even after Uncle Charlie died\\
405 - we managed to stay there.\\
406 - I mean, who else could have done that?\\
407 - I did always make sure you had a roof over your head.\\
408 - Even if it was someone else's.\\
409 - Yeah, you did.\\
410 - And there were a lot of hot chicks under that roof.\\
411 - You don't even want to know how many times I lost my virginity.\\
412 - No, I.. Yeah, no, I don't.\\
413 - I guess what I'm trying to say is\\
414 - I wouldn't want anyone else to be my dad.\\
415 - Aw.\\
416 - - I wish you hadn't said that. - Why?\\
417 - Now I got to give you the rest of the money.\\
418 -     Men       \\
419 - - Oh. - Okay.\\
420 - So this was a good idea.\\
421 - No. This was a great idea.\\
422 - And that move you did at the end there. That's Yowza.\\
423 - You can thank Buzz Aldrin for that one.\\
424 - It's even better in zero gravity.\\
425 - Hello? Nana?\\
426 - - 'Whoa!' - Whoa!\\
427 - Let me explain.\\
428 - I'm happy for you. You should be with an old guy.\\
429 -     Men       \\
430 -     Men       \\
431 - So, what do you think?\\
432 - I think, if we can find a way around this big hole\\
433 - we can make it to the Grand Canyon.\\
434 - - I love you, Jake. - I love you too, dad.\\
435 - This is majestic.\\
436 - Yeah. Hey, you know what else is majestic?\\
437 - [farts]\\

1 -     Men.   \\
2 - Tell me, Henry,\\
3 - why do you want to be Mr. Schmidt's assistant?\\
4 - He's my hero.\\
5 - I know everything about him.\\
6 - "Possible stalker."\\
7 - And why do you think you're qualified?\\
8 - Like him, I graduated high school at 16.\\
9 - Then I completed the four-year computer science program\\
10 - at Harvard in just under two years,\\
11 - during which, I founded an Internet startup,\\
12 - and I'm currently two semesters shy of my law degree.\\
13 - So, "no law degree."\\
14 - Let me tell you a few things\\
15 - about Walden Schmidt you may not know.\\
16 - Uh, the man is a genius.\\
17 - I knew that.\\
18 - "Likes to interrupt."\\
19 - He thinks in a different way than the rest of us.\\
20 - His mind is always working.\\
21 - Every time he opens his mouth,\\
22 - it's because he has something important to say.\\
23 - WALDEN: Love the new toilet paper\\
24 - you bought, Alan.\\
25 - It's like sliding down a rainbow.\\
26 - Except the pot at the end doesn't have any gold in it.\\
27 - When you hear something this good,\\
28 - you should write it down.\\
29 - I'm sorry.\\
30 - Who's this?\\
31 - Oh, this is, uh, Henry Johnson.\\
32 - He's interviewing for the assistant job.\\
33 - Uh, assistant job?\\
34 - Hi, Mr. Schmidt.\\
35 - It's such an honor...[stuttering]\\
36 - Eye contact.\\
37 - It's okay, Henry.\\
38 - [mouthing]\\
39 - Alan, can I talk to you for a second?\\
40 - Uh, no problem, Mr. Schmidt.\\
41 - "Hi"? Really?\\
42 - Not looking good, Hank.\\
43 - What's up?\\
44 - Why are you interviewing Henry to be my assistant\\
45 - when I just hired you to be my assistant?\\
46 - Oh, no, no, he's interviewing to be myassistant.\\
47 - Your assistant?\\
48 - Well, intern, actually.\\
49 - He's not gonna cost us a penny, and he's gonna do\\
50 - all the menial stuff I don't want to do.\\
51 - Well, why don't I just hire him for free\\
52 - and cut out the middle man?\\
53 - And in case I'm going too fast, you're the middle man.\\
54 - But I'm the big picture guy.\\
55 - See, bringing Henry on to Team Schmidt...\\
56 - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Team Schmidt?\\
57 - Yeah, I'm gonna get hats and shirts made.\\
58 - Well, Henry is.\\
59 - We're gonna have a new slogan.\\
60 - "No bull-Schmidt."\\
61 - "Schmidt happens."\\
62 - You're a Schmidt head.\\
63 - I hired you to be my assistant to help you out financially\\
64 - 'cause you had close your chiropractic office.\\
65 - I didn't have to close it; I'm in a rent dispute.\\
66 - People in rent disputes don't fake their own death.\\
67 - [doorbell rings]Oh, I'll get that.\\
68 - You are looking good today, boss.\\
69 - That's why he got good toilet paper.\\
70 - So my ass is clean while he's kissing it.\\
71 - Huh, my 12:00 must be early.\\
72 - Someone who really wanted this job\\
73 - would've taken the initiative.\\
74 - Too late, Harvard.\\
75 - Hello.\\
76 - Hi. You Alan Harper?\\
77 - Yes, I am. And, uh, and you are...?\\
78 - Your niece.\\
79 - Eurniece?\\
80 - That's a... that's a pretty name.\\
81 - Is that Dutch?\\
82 - No, I'm Jenny.\\
83 - I'm your brother Charlie's daughter.\\
84 - Uh, Henry?Yes?\\
85 - Catch me.\\
86 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
87 -     Ooh        Men.    \\
88 -     Men.   \\
89 - Uh, I'm-I'm sorry,\\
90 - did-did you say that you're... Charlie's daughter?\\
91 - Yeah.\\
92 - Listen, I got a wicked hangover.\\
93 - You got any aspirin, ibuprofen, rum, Scotch, tequila, vodka?\\
94 - Uh, yeah, yeah, come on in.\\
95 - Uh, Henry, uh, get her an aspirin and vodka.\\
96 - On it!\\
97 - Kitchen's that way.Damn it!\\
98 - I-I can't believe this.\\
99 - I mean, I can, but I-I can't.\\
100 - I mean, how did this happen?\\
101 - From what my mom told me...\\
102 - Ooh, can we... can we maybe turn down the lights?\\
103 - That's the sun.\\
104 - Right, I hate the sun.\\
105 - It's like God calling you an alcoholic.\\
106 - Anyway, according to my mom, it was love at first sight.\\
107 - They met in a bar,\\
108 - they got drunk and had sex in the bathroom.\\
109 - [chuckles] It was like a freakin' Disney movie.\\
110 - Poke-a-hot-ass.\\
111 - And where did the kid go for the vodka? Poland?\\
112 - Look, I don't mean to be rude,\\
113 - but how do I know that you're really Charlie's daughter?\\
114 - I mean, this could be some kind of scam.\\
115 - I have a picture of us together.\\
116 - It's in here somewhere.\\
117 - Oh, look. [laughs]\\
118 - My vagina.\\
119 - [chuckles]\\
120 - Oh, wait, that's not mine.\\
121 - Oh, that's mine.\\
122 - [chuckles]\\
123 - Ah, there you go.\\
124 - This was taken at my fourth birthday party.\\
125 - Just a heads up, I might vomit; where's the nearest bathroom?\\
126 - Oh, right down the hall.\\
127 - Okay, I think we're good,\\
128 - but it's always nice to have a plan.\\
129 - Anyway, this was party was the last time I saw him.\\
130 - After that, he just sent checks.\\
131 - He-he sent checks?\\
132 - Yeah, my mom didn't want him to have anything to do with me,\\
133 - but he always made sure I was taken care of.\\
134 - He never said a word about any of this to me.\\
135 - I'm his brother, his-his blood.\\
136 - Were they big checks?\\
137 - Yeah, got one every month.\\
138 - Bastard.\\
139 - My mom just called me special.\\
140 - This Henry guy is awesome.\\
141 - Did you know I won a spelling bee in fifth grade?\\
142 - I didn't!\\
143 - Who's this, Henry's assistant?\\
144 - Walden, this is Jenny,\\
145 - my brother's daughter.\\
146 - Really?\\
147 - Hi. Hi.\\
148 - I, uh, didn't know Charlie had a daughter.\\
149 - Neither did I.\\
150 - He sent her checks, big checks.\\
151 - Not that that matters now.\\
152 - [whispers]: Every month!\\
153 - Hey, am I related\\
154 - to Abercrombie & Fitch over here?\\
155 - No, I own the house.\\
156 - Oh. I assumed it was Alan's.\\
157 - So does he.\\
158 - So, uh, tell us more about you.\\
159 - Not much to tell.\\
160 - I was born in New York,\\
161 - got kicked out of a few private schools,\\
162 - tried to become a doctor to make my mom happy,\\
163 - dropped out, became an actress to piss her off.\\
164 - An actress, oh.\\
165 - Your father loved actresses.\\
166 - Yeah, I was only going to med school\\
167 - so I could write myself prescriptions for oxy.\\
168 - Oh, your father loved oxy.\\
169 - HENRY: Sorry it took so long.\\
170 - Here's vodka and two aspirin.\\
171 - Thank God. Oh.\\
172 - I was wrong; I am gonna puke.\\
173 - Your father loved to puke.\\
174 -     Men.   \\
175 - So, when I was, like, five,\\
176 - my mom married this total loser named Rob.\\
177 - He moved in with us and never looked for a job,\\
178 - but he's been sponging off of her ever since.\\
179 - Who does that?\\
180 - So, uh, how long you been in L.A.?\\
181 - Couple weeks.\\
182 - And you got a place to stay?\\
183 - He asks, knowing full well she's a Harper.\\
184 - Yeah, I'm crashing at a friend's house.\\
185 - That's great. Friends are great.\\
186 - You should make some friends, Alan.\\
187 - So, just the two of you live here?\\
188 - Uh, well, my son, your cousin Jake,\\
189 - uh, used to live with us, but he's in the army now.\\
190 - Stationed in Japan.\\
191 - Oh, that's impressive.\\
192 - Because of the time difference,\\
193 - he thinks he lives in the future.\\
194 - Maybe we can call him and find out\\
195 - when this headache's gonna go away.\\
196 - Oh, and, uh, you have a grandmother.\\
197 - Oh, that's great!\\
198 - In theory.\\
199 - When she finds out she has a granddaughter,\\
200 - she's gonna have a heart attack.\\
201 - You know, I'm gonna call her right now.\\
202 -     Men.   \\
203 - This is it.\\
204 - This was your dad's room.\\
205 - Wow.\\
206 - I always tried to imagine what my dad's life was like.\\
207 - It's weird to finally see it.\\
208 - I never met him, but I heard he was quite a guy.\\
209 - I heard he was a drunken man whore.\\
210 - Like I said, quite a guy.\\
211 - So, uh,\\
212 - this your and Alan's room?\\
213 - What?\\
214 - [chuckles]: No.\\
215 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.\\
216 - We're not... I'm not...\\
217 - The, um... really?\\
218 - You really don't think I can do better than Alan?\\
219 - I don't know.\\
220 - Maybe he's got a huge schlong.\\
221 - Well, we're not a couple, and he doesn't.\\
222 - Which is fine. I mean, not that size matters.\\
223 - Not that I was looking.\\
224 - I'm not gay.\\
225 - So why is he still living here?\\
226 - Well, at first...\\
227 - Then...\\
228 - I don't know.\\
229 - So, um,\\
230 - this is where your dad used to sleep.\\
231 - I got a new mattress,\\
232 - and I replaced the carpets and the drapes\\
233 - and pretty much anything that could absorb fluid.\\
234 - Wow.\\
235 - If these walls could talk.\\
236 - They'd probably say, "Can I get a towel?"\\
237 - So, I mean,\\
238 - I wish there was more that Charlie left behind.\\
239 - You know, other than Alan.\\
240 - So... [sighs]\\
241 - my dad stood in this same spot, staring out at the ocean.\\
242 - I wonder what was going through his mind.\\
243 - I wonder what he was thinking.\\
244 - Besides, of course,\\
245 - "how can I nail those two hot surfer chicks out there?"\\
246 - Huh, now I'm thinking it.\\
247 - Oh, please.\\
248 - With your looks and this house, I'm sure you do fine.\\
249 - Well, you'd think that, but the truth is,\\
250 - when it comes to women, I've never really been much\\
251 - of a casual sex kind of guy.\\
252 - And every time I do get close to one,\\
253 - she ends up pulling away from me,\\
254 - and then I wind up back in this room,\\
255 - thinking where I went wrong again.\\
256 - Alone.\\
257 - So alone.\\
258 - [sighs]\\
259 - Oh, yeah.\\
260 - [chuckles] You're not gay.\\
261 - Mom, I have some news for you.\\
262 - Sit down.\\
263 - Okay, push him off and sit up.\\
264 - Um, I know this is gonna come as quite the shock,\\
265 - but it turns out Charlie has a daughter.\\
266 - Mom? Mom?\\
267 - Are you dead?\\
268 - Oh, good.\\
269 - Um, no, I know.\\
270 - I know, it's crazy, right?\\
271 - Yeah, no, she's here now.\\
272 - Well, well, come on over.\\
273 - Okay, finish first and then come over.\\
274 - Good news. Uh, my mother's on her way over.\\
275 - First time I've ever said that.\\
276 - Wow, insta-family.\\
277 - Uncle, grandmother,\\
278 - step-hot-guy.\\
279 - I'm sorry, I don't know what to call you.\\
280 - Oh, step-hot-guy works.\\
281 - All that's missing is my dad.\\
282 - Actually, he's here, too.\\
283 - Um, follow me.\\
284 - Uh, where are we going?\\
285 - Uh, well, you know how sailors get buried at sea?\\
286 - Yeah.I keep Charlie in the liquor cabinet.\\
287 - Let's see.\\
288 - Uh, Johnnie Walker, Jack Daniel's...\\
289 - Charlie Harper.\\
290 - Huh, he looks different than his pictures.\\
291 - Um, Charlie, this is your daughter Jenny.\\
292 - Hi, Dad!\\
293 - This seems weird. Does this seem weird to anybody else?\\
294 - Yes, it's weird.\\
295 - Almost as weird as when we take him to the movies.\\
296 - Charlie, I wish you were here\\
297 - to see how beautiful your daughter turned out.\\
298 - I-I think you'd be impressed.\\
299 - I think a lot of...\\
300 - Oh!\\
301 - [coughs]\\
302 - Oh, not again.\\
303 - I ain't cleaning that up.\\
304 -     Men.   \\
305 - Oh. Oh, look.\\
306 - A quarter.\\
307 - Unbelievable.\\
308 - You even mooch off the dead.\\
309 - One more.\\
310 - Yeah, you're Charlie's daughter.\\
311 - You don't seem very surprised.\\
312 - Only surprised there aren't more of you running around.\\
313 - God, I loved your dad.\\
314 - I remember the first time I met him.\\
315 - He asked me if I knew how to do three things:\\
316 - cook, clean and score an eight ball\\
317 - at 2:30 in the morning.\\
318 - I told him I didn't know how to cook or clean.\\
319 - I've been here ever since.\\
320 - [laughs]\\
321 - I'm-I'm sure you have a story about Charlie\\
322 - that doesn't involve drugs.\\
323 - Okay. One time at Mardi Gras...\\
324 - Or alcohol.\\
325 - All right.\\
326 - Once when Charlie was in Vegas...\\
327 - Or hookers.\\
328 - Geez, you're really tying my hands!\\
329 - Okay, I got it.\\
330 - It was New Year's Eve,\\
331 - and Charlie was super not drunk,\\
332 - and he was with this crazy not hooker,\\
333 - and he decided to have his sphincter bleached.\\
334 - Whoa! Whoa! What?\\
335 - Why?\\
336 - Because he cared about women.\\
337 - Unfortunately, it got infected, and he needed me\\
338 - [voice breaks]: to dab a little ointment...\\
339 - I'm sorry.\\
340 - It's just that I miss him so much!\\
341 - God took the wrong Harper!\\
342 - [door closes]\\
343 - EVELYN: Where is my granddaughter?\\
344 - Did it just get cold in here?\\
345 - Oh, my God.\\
346 - Look at you.\\
347 - Mom, this is Jenny.\\
348 - Jenny,\\
349 - this is Evelyn.\\
350 - You are so beautiful.\\
351 - You remind me of me ten years ago.\\
352 - Your father was the apple of my eye.\\
353 - My greatest gift.\\
354 - My reason for living.\\
355 - Uh, hello.\\
356 - Hello, Alan.\\
357 - I can't believe I finally have a grandchild.\\
358 - You already have a grandchild-- Jake.\\
359 - Oh. Sure. Yeah.\\
360 - So, Jennifer...\\
361 - Actually, it's Jenny.\\
362 - Darling, you're not 12 anymore. It's Jennifer.\\
363 - We are going to have so much fun together:\\
364 - lunching, shopping, taking care of those eyebrows.\\
365 - Where are you staying while you're in town?\\
366 - I'm crashing on a friend's couch.\\
367 - Not anymore. You'll stay with me.\\
368 - Aw! I love you, Evelyn.\\
369 - Whoa, whoa! If she's staying anywhere,\\
370 - she's gonna stay at my place.\\
371 - And by "your place," do you mean\\
372 - the office that you stopped paying rent at\\
373 - or the house that you've never paid rent at?\\
374 - Look, I'm not gonna let my mom screw her up\\
375 - like she did me and Charlie.\\
376 - Hey! I was a good mother.\\
377 - No, you know who was a good mother?\\
378 - Our housekeeper Adela. She even breast-fed me.\\
379 - She had just had a baby.\\
380 - And when the milk truck is parked on the street,\\
381 - you don't go to the grocery store.\\
382 - Besides, you-you used to gnaw on me.\\
383 - You're gnawer.\\
384 - Nang-nang-nang-nang- nang-nang-nang.\\
385 - You know what? She's gonna stay in Jake's room.\\
386 - Whoa, whoa, no.\\
387 - I do not want Jake's room to become Jenny's room.\\
388 - You know, in fact, there is no Jake's room\\
389 - and there's no Jenny's room.\\
390 - There's just Walden's room.\\
391 - And Charlie's room.\\
392 - Why don't we let her decide?\\
393 - Yeah, yeah, it's up to her.\\
394 - Is anyone listening to me?!\\
395 - Jennifer?\\
396 - Where'd she go?\\
397 - Nice job, Alan.\\
398 - You made another woman disappear.\\
399 - Can you believe her?\\
400 - What did I do to her to make her hate me so much?\\
401 - Nang-nang-nang-nang- nang-nang-nang.\\
402 - Oh, oh. What, you, too?\\
403 - Oh!\\
404 - Son of a...\\
405 - Ooh, a nickel!\\
406 -     Men.   \\
407 - This is ridiculous.\\
408 - We're never going to find her.\\
409 - I don't understand why she ran off like that.\\
410 - I can think of two reasons.\\
411 - First I lost my Charlie, now I've lost my Jennifer.\\
412 - You still have your Alan.\\
413 - Oh! Don't make it worse.\\
414 - Nang-nang-nang-nang- nang-nang-nang.\\
415 - Oh, God, my granddaughter's gone forever.\\
416 - Oh, there she is at the bus stop.\\
417 - Oh, God, my granddaughter rides the bus!\\
418 - Jenny, what are you doing?\\
419 - I'm trying to get away from you people.\\
420 - Look, I just wanted to see where my dad lived.\\
421 - I didn't want to screw up your family.\\
422 - Uh, for the record,\\
423 - they were screwed up long before you got here.\\
424 - It's true.\\
425 - H-Hey, if I'm screwed up, it's your fault.\\
426 - You raised me.\\
427 - I didn't raise you, Adela did.\\
428 - Look, I already have a messed-up family.\\
429 - I-I don't need another one.\\
430 - Oh, we're sorry.\\
431 - This is just how we express our love.\\
432 - Through hate. Oh, no, no, no.\\
433 - W-We don't hate each other.\\
434 - I mean, the truth is, my mother is an amazing woman.\\
435 - I mean, she-she raised two kids on her own,\\
436 - she's a successful businesswoman,\\
437 - she has impeccable taste.\\
438 - Thank you, Alan.\\
439 - Oh, right.\\
440 - Uh, and Alan is...\\
441 - the reason I had my tubes tied.\\
442 - Because she knew she would never do better than me.\\
443 - Please, sweetheart, I just found you.\\
444 - I can't lose you now.\\
445 - We want you to be a part of our lives.\\
446 - What do you say?\\
447 - Well, if I'm gonna be a part of this family,\\
448 - I'm gonna need a drink.\\
449 - You hear that, Charlie?\\
450 - Your daughter needs a drink.\\
451 - You're looking the wrong way, Mom.\\
452 -     Men.   \\
453 - A toast. To Charlie Harper.\\
454 - My brother, your son, your father, and your...\\
455 - Guy who got hit by a train so I could buy his beach house?\\
456 - Sorry, Evelyn.\\
457 - It's okay. I got the commission.\\
458 - To Charlie.\\
459 - So, is that the bathroom\\
460 - where the miracle of my life began?\\
461 - It is.\\
462 - Want to see it?\\
463 - I do.\\
464 - Text a picture of it to my mom.\\
465 - Should be good for some guilt money.\\
466 - I'll run interference.\\
467 - All right, everybody out!\\
468 - Woman visiting the place of her conception!\\
469 - I can't tell you how relieved I am\\
470 - to finally have an heir. Mm.\\
471 - Wait, what?\\
472 - She's my granddaughter.\\
473 - I want to provide for her.\\
474 - And since I wasn't around\\
475 - for the first 25 years of her life,\\
476 - it's only fitting that she inherit my estate.\\
477 - You weren't around for the first 45 years of my life.\\
478 - You have Walden!\\
479 - Oh, oh, do I? Do you see a ring on this finger?\\
480 - Don't worry, darling.\\
481 - There's a little something for you in my will.\\
482 - A little something?\\
483 - Look, if you knew\\
484 - you were gonna get everything,\\
485 - you would've smothered me with a pillow years ago.\\
486 - That is not true.\\
487 - If I knew I had money coming, I'd hire a professional.\\
488 - How'd it go?Great.\\
489 - I laughed, I cried.\\
490 - I peed.\\
491 - How are you guys doing over here?\\
492 - Can I get you anything else?\\
493 - Yeah, we might need a designated driver\\
494 - to get us back to his beautiful beach house.\\
495 - I'll take you guys. I get off in 15.\\
496 - Great. Thanks.\\
497 - She's cute.\\
498 - Told ya.\\
499 - Malibu beach house gets you laid every time.\\
500 - Not every time.\\
501 -     Men.   \\
502 - Oh, my God, this house is amazing!\\
503 - Well, it's... Yeah.\\
504 - And look at that view.\\
505 - It's even better from the bedroom.\\
506 - Want to see?\\
507 - Yeah.\\
508 - After you.\\
509 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
510 - Where are you going?\\
511 - Up to show her.\\
512 - Oh, you thought...?\\
513 - Oh, no-no-no-no-no, she's mine.\\
514 - Next time I'll get two.\\
515 - What just happened?\\
516 - Charlie's back.\\
517 -     Men.   \\
518 -     Men.   \\
519 - Good morning.\\
520 - No, no, not good.\\
521 - I slept in the guest room of my own house,\\
522 - and I'm pretty sure I still have some of your brother in my ear.\\
523 - Don't worry, tonight I'll tell Jenny\\
524 - that your bedroom's off limits.\\
525 - No, there is no tonight!\\
526 - But she's family.\\
527 - Not my family.\\
528 - And I'm gonna tell her she can't stay.\\
529 - Morning. Hi.\\
530 - You girls have a good night?\\
531 - Oh, yeah.\\
532 - I'm surprised I can even talk.\\

1 -     Men.   \\
2 - [exhales]\\
3 - [sighs]\\
4 - [whirring]\\
5 - Really?\\
6 - Do you have to do this right now?\\
7 - Wow, that's the first time anyone ever complained\\
8 - about me doing too much work around here.\\
9 - Why don't you go do that on the deck?\\
10 - Because... this is my house.\\
11 - I can work out wherever I want.\\
12 - Besides, when I do yoga on the deck,\\
13 - the kids on the beach call me gay.\\
14 - You sure that's not because you live with a middle-aged man?\\
15 - Morning.\\
16 - Morning.\\
17 - Ooh, a little yoga?\\
18 - Yeah, I'm just trying to clear my head.\\
19 - Um, speaking of heads,\\
20 - Buddha's poking his out of the temple.\\
21 - You know what? If I lived here alone, it wouldn't matter.\\
22 - Right.\\
23 - Sorry. Namaste.\\
24 - What does "Namaste" actually mean?\\
25 - Get out!\\
26 - Okay.\\
27 - I'm gonna "nama-not-stay" right here.\\
28 - Okay, focus.\\
29 - I want peace...\\
30 - I want serenity...\\
31 - [blender whirring]\\
32 - I want a murder weapon.\\
33 - Dude!\\
34 - You need to relax.\\
35 - Do some yoga or something.\\
36 - What is that?\\
37 - It's a holistic hangover cure.\\
38 - Kale, wheatgrass, three shots of tequila.\\
39 - Cheers.\\
40 - You know what? Screw it.\\
41 - I'm gonna stay drunk.\\
42 - [belches]\\
43 - Oh, yikes. Think I ate a little\\
44 - too much ginger last night.\\
45 - Oh, you had sushi for dinner?\\
46 - Yeah, let's go with that.\\
47 - It's crazy, isn't it?\\
48 - We finally get rid of Jake,\\
49 - and now we got another one on our hands.\\
50 - Yeah, about that...\\
51 - What is the long-range plan here?\\
52 - I don't know.\\
53 - I always thought we'd spend\\
54 - our golden years together.\\
55 - Eventually, maybe sell the beach house,\\
56 - move to the desert,\\
57 - spend our days toiling in our cactus garden.\\
58 - Yeah, that sounds swell, but...\\
59 - Go out to early bird dinners\\
60 - wearing matching jumpsuits... Okay.\\
61 - Look, I'm not gonna wear a jump...\\
62 - All right. You know what?\\
63 - Let's try this another way.\\
64 - Uh, in your romantic fantasy of our future,\\
65 - where is Jenny?\\
66 - She'll spend Christmas with us,\\
67 - but we're gonna want our alone time.\\
68 - Okay, let's focus on that word "alone."\\
69 - Mm-hmm.\\
70 - Having house guests is the best.\\
71 - You know, you get excited to see them,\\
72 - you put out the fluffy towels,\\
73 - you hold your farts, everything's nice...\\
74 - but, eventually, you have to fart.\\
75 - Here's what you do.\\
76 - Uh, you go out on the deck,\\
77 - and pretend to look at the ocean,\\
78 - wait for a big wave\\
79 - and when it breaks, so do you.\\
80 - Alan, I'm putting in a home gym.\\
81 - And it's either going in Jenny's room\\
82 - or Alan's room.\\
83 - It's your call.\\
84 - Bitch be gone.\\
85 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
86 -     Ah.         Men.         Men.    \\
87 -     Men.   \\
88 - Here we go.\\
89 - An appletini a day keeps the doctor away.\\
90 - Cute.\\
91 - And what keeps Alan away?\\
92 - You.\\
93 - Touch  .\\
94 - Why am I here?\\
95 - Oh, I just thought we could get together.\\
96 - Maybe find out what's going on in each other's lives.\\
97 - There's never anything going on in your life, Alan.\\
98 - Okay, you start.\\
99 - All right, let's see...\\
100 - Well, my boyfriend Marty has just moved in.\\
101 - Moved in?\\
102 - That's a little fast.\\
103 - He's 91 and a half.\\
104 - He doesn't do anything fast.\\
105 - So you two sleep in the same room?\\
106 - If you're trying to find out if we have sex, yes, we do.\\
107 - Frequently and nastily.\\
108 - Good God!\\
109 - The man is in a wheelchair.\\
110 - How do you think he got there?\\
111 - No, I was asking\\
112 - if your guest room is available.\\
113 - Darling, I-I would love\\
114 - for you to come stay with me,\\
115 - but with Marty there now, it's-it's impossible.\\
116 - Oh, not me. Jenny.\\
117 - Oh, Jennifer can move in.\\
118 - Wait.\\
119 - Why can she move in and not me?\\
120 - Darling, if you were a child,\\
121 - this would be one of those situations\\
122 - where I would give you five dollars to shut up.\\
123 - Well, I'm not a kid anymore, Mom.\\
124 - How's $20 sound?\\
125 - No, I want to have this conversation. Forty.\\
126 - We're done. Well...\\
127 - Mm-hmm.\\
128 -     Men.   \\
129 - All right, I'm out of here.\\
130 - Don't be a stranger, Jenny.\\
131 - I mean, I know that you are one\\
132 - but that didn't stop me\\
133 - from letting you stay here.\\
134 - And that didn't stop me\\
135 - from throwing up in your...\\
136 - Ah, you know, you'll figure it out.\\
137 - Um, h-have you got everything?\\
138 - Yeah, I think so.\\
139 - Oh, uh...\\
140 - There's a girl in my room,\\
141 - uh, Tara,\\
142 - Tanya...\\
143 - I don't really know what the hell her name is.\\
144 - It's tattooed right above her ass.\\
145 - Anyway, when she wakes up,\\
146 - will you give her this for cab fare?\\
147 - And uh, uh...\\
148 - tell her I, "Mackenzie,"\\
149 - will call her\\
150 - if I get back from the Congo.\\
151 - See you.\\
152 - Bye. Take care.\\
153 - [door closes]\\
154 - Can you believe that?\\
155 - I know.\\
156 - A Harper left this house voluntarily.\\
157 - And gave me money.\\
158 -     Men.   \\
159 - [doorbell rings]\\
160 - Hi, Alan.\\
161 - Lyndsey.\\
162 - This is a surprise.\\
163 - I know; I-I'm sorry.\\
164 - I just need to talk to you in person.\\
165 - Oh, yeah, yeah. Come on in.\\
166 - Are we alone?\\
167 - WALDEN: Never!\\
168 - Hi, Walden.\\
169 - Can we talk in private?\\
170 - Oh, sure, let's go in my room.\\
171 - Oh, uh, hold on a second.\\
172 - Okay, we're all set.\\
173 - Aw, dude, come on!\\
174 - So what's up?\\
175 - Ow! Nipple!\\
176 - [sighs]\\
177 - I am so mad at you.\\
178 - Why?\\
179 - Because I-I'm with Larry now.\\
180 - He's smart, handsome, successful...\\
181 - God, you have a type.\\
182 - No.\\
183 - When I'm with him, I can't stop fantasizing about you.\\
184 - Okay, I-I-I'm confused.\\
185 - I'm getting a chubby, but I'm confused.\\
186 - So you want to get back together?\\
187 - Oh, God, no.\\
188 - I just want to have sex with you.\\
189 - Why?\\
190 - And why am I asking?\\
191 - I don't know.\\
192 - I just know that I do.\\
193 - Of course.\\
194 - Forbidden fruit is so much sweeter.\\
195 - Go on, pluck my forbidden fruit.\\
196 - Pop my cherry.\\
197 - Peel my banana.\\
198 - Squeeze my fuzzy peaches.\\
199 - In my fantasy... Yeah?\\
200 - ...you don't talk.\\
201 -     Men.   \\
202 - Bye, Walden.\\
203 - Bye, Lyndsey.\\
204 - [door closes]\\
205 - [whoops]\\
206 - [chuckling]\\
207 - Um, is it hot in here or did I just have sex?\\
208 - Did you guys get back together?\\
209 - Better.\\
210 - She wants nothing from me\\
211 - except the old Harper harpoon.\\
212 - Wha-bam!\\
213 - Know what I'm sayin'?\\
214 - How is it possible\\
215 - that you're having sex and I'm not?\\
216 - Well, apparently, her perfect boyfriend Larry\\
217 - has an Achilles heel...\\
218 - and it's on his penis.\\
219 - Wha-bam!\\
220 - Um...\\
221 - have you guys seen Mackenzie?\\
222 - She went to Cabo.Congo.\\
223 - She's not here.She's dead.\\
224 - In the Congo.\\
225 - Sorry, Tanya.\\
226 - Tara.\\
227 - Alyssa.\\
228 -     Men.   \\
229 - So...\\
230 - Evy tells me you want to be an actress.\\
231 - I figured with my daddy issues,\\
232 - it was either that or stripping.\\
233 - You've certainly got the rack for either one.\\
234 - Bless your heart.\\
235 - My heart is in a landfill.\\
236 - This baby belonged to\\
237 - a drunken quarterback from Alabama.\\
238 - Roll Tide!\\
239 - You know, Marty is a television legend.\\
240 - He created Here Comes Pleshkin.\\
241 - I love that show.\\
242 - Th-That was a drinking game\\
243 - in college.\\
244 - Every time someone would yell "Pleshkin!"\\
245 - I would take a shot.\\
246 - I had so much drunken sex because of your show.\\
247 - It was a piece of crap,\\
248 - but it paid for my first six... sevenwives.\\
249 - And Pleshkin?\\
250 - Hermaphrodite.\\
251 - Once, he comes in three hours late.\\
252 - I tell him to go screw himself.\\
253 - He says, "Why do you think I'm three hours late?"\\
254 - That's a joke, sweetheart.\\
255 - Feel free to laugh.\\
256 - Is this thing on?\\
257 - Roll Tide!\\
258 - Pleshkin!\\
259 - [laughs]\\
260 - I need another one. Marty?\\
261 - Why not?\\
262 - I got my liver from a narcoleptic\\
263 - Vietnamese rickshaw driver.\\
264 - Evy, that's the best gift you have ever given me.\\
265 - What do you mean?\\
266 - You, me, Jenny,\\
267 - a handful of little blue pills...\\
268 - It's like the Spring Break of '43 all over again!\\
269 - Marty, she's my granddaughter.\\
270 - I know.\\
271 - I have had some of the most decadent\\
272 - sexual encounters imaginable:\\
273 - mother/daughter, twins,\\
274 - triplets, Pleshkin.\\
275 - But never the elusive grandmother/granddaughter combo.\\
276 - She's gay.\\
277 - It just keeps getting better.\\
278 - Sweetheart, while-while I normally love\\
279 - your unique brand of depravity,\\
280 - this is where I draw the line.\\
281 - So when it's me and the plumber, it's fine.\\
282 - You wanted that as much as I did.\\
283 - I had my eye on his kidney.\\
284 -     Men.   \\
285 - [giggling] [chuckling]: This is so exciting.\\
286 - Another man's bed,\\
287 - another man's woman,\\
288 - another man's... Home!\\
289 - I know, it's so dirty.\\
290 - No, no, no, the garage door just opened!\\
291 - And here comes the car.\\
292 - Beep! Beep!\\
293 - No, Larry's home! Get out!\\
294 - What do I do? What do I do? Uh...\\
295 - Hide in the closet?\\
296 - Uh... under the bed?\\
297 - Ooh, I could put on a wig and a dress\\
298 - and pretend I'm one of your friends.\\
299 - Out the window!\\
300 - Right, good call.\\
301 - Whoa, we are up there.\\
302 - Oh, beautiful view. Oh!\\
303 - Hey, is that the Hollywood sign...!\\
304 - [thudding]\\
305 -     Men.   \\
306 -     Men.   \\
307 - What happened to you?\\
308 - Oh, these? [chuckles]\\
309 - I was with Lyndsey last night, at her boyfriend's house,\\
310 - and he came home early,\\
311 - and I had to jump out the window.\\
312 - Alan Harper: Love Burglar.\\
313 - I like it better than Alan Harper: Roommate.\\
314 - It's just so much fun to be thought of as a piece of meat.\\
315 - She doesn't care about what I think or what I say.\\
316 - I know how she feels.\\
317 - Let me ask you something.\\
318 - How would you like it if you were the poor schmuck\\
319 - being cheated on?\\
320 - I've always been the poor schmuck.\\
321 - And how did it feel?\\
322 - Horrible.\\
323 - Ha-ha, suck it, Larry!\\
324 - I know you're having fun, Alan,\\
325 - but sooner or later, somebody's gonna get hurt.\\
326 - Oh, believe me, someone got hurt last night.\\
327 - Boom, boom, boom!\\
328 - Know what I'm saying?\\
329 - Okay, from now on, let's just assume that I know\\
330 - what you're saying and I don't like it.\\
331 -     Men.   \\
332 - All right, you are hair-free.\\
333 - You missed a spot.\\
334 - You are a dirty old man.\\
335 - If I'm such a dirty old man,\\
336 - maybe it's time for my sponge bath.\\
337 - [chuckles]\\
338 - Paging Nurse Evelyn!\\
339 - Report to Marty's crotch with a loofah!\\
340 - [laughing]\\
341 - You ready to go?\\
342 - I'll be right with you, dear.\\
343 - Where are you going? What about\\
344 - rubba-dub-dub, Marty's in the tub?\\
345 - I'll be right back.\\
346 - We're just going to the spa.\\
347 - Yeah, Marty, you'll be happy. When I she comes back,\\
348 - she'll have less hair than your ears.\\
349 - But this is date night.\\
350 - I'll be back by 8:00.\\
351 - That's after Wheel. I'll be asleep.\\
352 - I'll make it up to you in the morning.\\
353 - I'm 91-and-a-half!\\
354 - I can't plan that far ahead!\\
355 -     Men.   \\
356 - That was amazing.\\
357 - It was.\\
358 - You seen my underwear?\\
359 - Do you mean...\\
360 - these?\\
361 - You know what? Keep 'em.\\
362 - Ooh, thank you.\\
363 - Where you going?\\
364 - What do you mean? Home. We're done.\\
365 - So it's just wham, bam, thank you...\\
366 - incredibly powerful, yet sensitive lover man?\\
367 - Aw, don't get my panties in a bunch.\\
368 - I'm serious. We never talk.\\
369 - Because we're not dating.\\
370 - I thought you were okay with this.\\
371 - I am. That doesn't mean we can't take an interest\\
372 - in each others' lives.\\
373 - For example, did you know Charlie had a daughter?\\
374 - Really? Yeah!\\
375 - That's great!\\
376 - You can talk to her.\\
377 - Fine. Whatever.\\
378 - Oh, for the love of God!\\
379 - What do you want from me?\\
380 - Well, if you must know,\\
381 - she's coming over for dinner tomorrow night,\\
382 - and I just thought that maybe you'd like to join us.\\
383 - Dinner? Seriously?\\
384 - Forget I mentioned it.\\
385 - Okay, look, I'll see what I can do.\\
386 - Really?\\
387 - I'll try.\\
388 - Oh, thank you.\\
389 - You've made me so happy.\\
390 - Great. See ya.\\
391 - [sighs]\\
392 - I should've just bought a damn vibrator.\\
393 -     Men.   \\
394 - Here ya go, Marty.\\
395 - Just the way you like it--\\
396 - scotch and Metamucil.\\
397 - Why aren't we eating?\\
398 - It's almost 6:00.\\
399 - Where are we, France?\\
400 - We're waiting for Alan's girlfriend.\\
401 - I thought hewas Alan's girlfriend?\\
402 - No. I own the house.\\
403 - It's actually a funny story. I was on the beach and I went...\\
404 - Don't care.\\
405 - Marty, don't be rude.\\
406 - I'm sorry. Low blood sugar.\\
407 - Plus, I really don't care.\\
408 - Unbelievable.\\
409 - Lyndsey's not answering any of my calls\\
410 - and she hasn't returned any of my texts.\\
411 - I told you you were gonna get hurt.\\
412 - [mocking]: I told you you were gonna get hurt.\\
413 - You know what?\\
414 - I'm gonna go get her.\\
415 - And don't try to stop me.\\
416 - Okay. Okay. Okay.\\
417 - No problem.\\
418 - Now that buzzkill is gone...\\
419 - anyone want to get high?\\
420 - Roll joint!\\
421 -     Men.   \\
422 - You think Alan's gonna mind\\
423 - that we started without him?\\
424 - Who's Alan?\\
425 - [Berta laughs]\\
426 - You know...\\
427 - I think I banged Lucille Ball in this house.\\
428 - She was my second-favorite redhead.\\
429 - Thank you. [chuckles]\\
430 - Wait a second.\\
431 - It's night.\\
432 - Why am I still here?\\
433 - I'll see you tomorrow.\\
434 - Are you okay to drive?\\
435 - I'm fine.\\
436 - Well, let me know when you get home.\\
437 - I'm home.\\
438 - [chuckles]\\
439 - Your father would've loved this night.\\
440 - We're all drunk, we're all high, and Alan's not here.\\
441 - Wait-- who's Alan?\\
442 - You know what we should do tomorrow?\\
443 - Go to the Malibu Police Station.\\
444 - They took more pictures of your dad than I did.\\
445 - Again?\\
446 - I want to stay home and play naked Jeopardy.\\
447 - I want to spend time with my daughter.\\
448 - Granddaughter.\\
449 - Oh, please, nobody's buying that.\\
450 - I am going into the living room, Evelyn.\\
451 - I suggest you push me there.\\
452 - We need to talk.\\
453 - Be back in a minute.\\
454 - There's a 50-50 chance\\
455 - he won't remember what he wants.\\
456 - If you're gonna talk about me,\\
457 - you shouldn't shave my ears first.\\
458 - He's great.\\
459 - Wonder what it's like to be 91.\\
460 - I imagine that you're wet in the places you used to be dry\\
461 - and dry in the places you used to be wet.\\
462 - What's wrong?\\
463 - Your granddaughter is coming between us...\\
464 - and not in the good way.\\
465 - Look, Marty, she just came into my life.\\
466 - And believe it or not,\\
467 - I wasn't always the best mom to Charlie or-or the other one.\\
468 - Jennifer is my second chance.\\
469 - You got to make a choice.\\
470 - It's me or the kid.\\
471 - I love you, Marty, but I have to pick my granddaughter.\\
472 - You know, I have $400 million.\\
473 - I'm not saying it isn't close.\\
474 - It's over.\\
475 - [chuckles] Okay, I'm bluffing.\\
476 - I really miss you.\\
477 - I miss you too, money... honey.\\
478 - Maybe I can make it up to you.\\
479 - If you can make it down to me, you can make it up to me.\\
480 - Something tells me that Marty doesn't want me around.\\
481 - What?! I can't imagine anyone not wanting you around.\\
482 - Really? Because I'm pretty sure\\
483 - I'm staying at my grandmother's\\
484 - because you don't want me around.\\
485 - No...!\\
486 - Maybe...\\
487 - Yes...\\
488 - I get it.\\
489 - You already have Alan.\\
490 - I do.\\
491 - Hey, do you think I'd look good in a jumpsuit?\\
492 - You'd look good in anything.\\
493 - That's 'cause I'm good-looking.\\
494 - I pretend like I don't know.\\
495 - Shh.\\
496 - Seriously, if you want privacy, then why do you have a roommate?\\
497 - Oh, you know, Alan's way more than a roommate.\\
498 - He's my best friend.\\
499 - He was there for me when I was all alone.\\
500 - He even took me into my own house.\\
501 - You know, him and-and his stoner son\\
502 - and his horny mom and your dead dad.\\
503 - I mean, they've really become my family.\\
504 - Mine, too.\\
505 - I guess that means you're becoming part of my family.\\
506 - Aw...!\\
507 - I'm the most masculine person in this house.\\
508 - [both laughing]\\
509 - I like you, Jenny.\\
510 - I like you, Walden.\\
511 - If you were a chick, I would totally do you.\\
512 - Aw! You, too!\\
513 - Hey, you're welcome to crash here any time\\
514 - you need a break from Evelyn and...\\
515 - 91-and-a-half shades of gray.\\
516 - Seriously?\\
517 - Yeah.\\
518 - You know, I was thinking about putting in a home gym,\\
519 - but big deal.\\
520 - I'd rather have a Jenny than a gym.\\
521 - You and me both.\\
522 - [both laugh]\\
523 - I get it.\\
524 - 'Cause Jim and gym are homonyms\\
525 - and you're a "hamma-sexual."\\
526 - It's awfully quiet in there. Did they leave?\\
527 - I don't know. Let me go look.\\
528 - I shouldn't have looked.\\
529 -     Men.   [doorbell rings]\\
530 - No matter what she says, do not cry.\\
531 - You're the prize here.\\
532 - [hushed]: Alan, what are you doing here?\\
533 - What are youdoing here? You're supposed\\
534 - to be at my house for dinner.\\
535 - I said I would try.\\
536 - And I said I wouldn't cry.\\
537 - And I guess we're both liars now.\\
538 - Would you keep it down? Larry's here.\\
539 - What? You don't want him to hear your whore?\\
540 - 'Cause that's all I am to you-- your whore!\\
541 - We agreed this was just about sex.\\
542 - Well, forgive me for falling in love.\\
543 - Alan, if you don't leave right now,\\
544 - you're never gonna see this again.\\
545 - Call at your convenience.\\
546 -     Men.   \\
547 -     Men.   [doorbell rings]\\
548 - I'll get that. It's probably Lyndsey looking\\
549 - for a little morning wood to start her fire.\\
550 - Know what I'm saying?\\
551 - I know what you're saying,\\
552 - I just don't know why you're saying it.\\
553 - Uh, hello?\\
554 - Mackenzie, you lying bitch!\\
555 - Uh-oh. Congo, my ass!\\
556 - Don't run! You don't want to run!\\
557 - Yeah, it feels like home again.\\

\subsection {Episode 03: This Unblessed Biscuit}
1 - [footsteps approach]\\
2 - You, uh, got a minute, boss?\\
3 - Actually, I'm kind of busy.\\
4 - I'm pushing new code on an API for this e-comm platform.\\
5 - "I am from the future.\\
6 - I am a handsome robot."\\
7 - Look, I-I wouldn't bother you with this\\
8 - if I didn't think it was important.\\
9 - Okay. Just make it quick.\\
10 - That's my specialty.\\
11 - Ask any woman I've ever been with.\\
12 - I will call them both.\\
13 - What do you got?\\
14 - Behold your new\\
15 - coffee mug.\\
16 - [imitates crowd cheering]\\
17 - What?\\
18 - Remember? You asked me to look for new mugs for your office.\\
19 - What do you think?\\
20 - Well, there's a hole on the top\\
21 - and no hole on the bottom.\\
22 - Nailed it.\\
23 - Thanks.\\
24 - Uh, so, uh, what do you want written on it?\\
25 - Written on it?\\
26 - Uh, your choices are\\
27 - "Coffee," "Java" or "Joe."\\
28 - I don't know. Just... Joe.\\
29 - Excellent choice.\\
30 - Although... what if you hire a guy named Joe?\\
31 - I-I think the temptation for these mugs\\
32 - to walk out the door is a little too high.\\
33 - Fine. Just write "Coffee" on it.\\
34 - Great! Uh, coffee in the mug,\\
35 - and coffee on the mug. Love it!\\
36 - Oh, uh...\\
37 - but, uh, let me run this past you:\\
38 - "Java the Mug."\\
39 - You know, because of Star Wars.\\
40 - Stop!\\
41 - Right. Right.\\
42 - You're busy. [laughs]\\
43 - Oh! Uh, one last thing.\\
44 - Oh, good God! Alan,\\
45 - I hired you as my assistant\\
46 - so I don't have to think about things like this.\\
47 - Oh, yeah, I know,\\
48 - but I want to do a good job for you.\\
49 - I mean, you're gonna look at this every day\\
50 - and I don't want you to hate it.\\
51 - That does happen with things\\
52 - I look at every day.\\
53 - Okay, so one final question:\\
54 - do you want your mug to be left-handed or right-handed?\\
55 - You're kidding, right?\\
56 - No, some people hold 'em in their left hand,\\
57 - some people hold 'em in their right hand.\\
58 - Mm-hmm.\\
59 - [dramatic gasp] Wow.\\
60 - Okay. Okay.\\
61 - Changing your mug from "World's Greatest Boss"\\
62 - to "World's Smartest Boss."Okay.\\
63 - I'm gonna go pee.\\
64 - Oh, oh, as long as you're in the bathroom, uh,\\
65 - I left three different types of toilet tissue in there for you.\\
66 - Uh, let me know which one is best.\\
67 - Oh! And the brown one is not a joke.\\
68 - "Hire me, Walden. I can be your assistant."\\
69 - You know what your mug should say? "World's Worst Employee."\\
70 - Oh, World's Second Worst Employee.\\
71 - Hey, nap time's over.\\
72 - I'm not napping.\\
73 - I threw my back out.\\
74 - My God, are you okay? What happened?\\
75 - It seized up when I was climbing into your bed to take a nap.\\
76 - Okay, uh, everything's gonna be okay.\\
77 - Just... relax.\\
78 - Alan, get up here!\\
79 - Why are you calling Zippy?\\
80 - He's a chiropractor-- he can help.\\
81 - [laughs] Oh, stop.\\
82 - It hurts when I laugh. [chuckles] Oh.\\
83 - Has this happened before?\\
84 - Once. At a bike rally in Sturgis.\\
85 - Me and a couple of Hells Angels decided to drop acid\\
86 - and get naked.\\
87 - Alan!\\
88 - What's going on?\\
89 - Is something wrong?\\
90 - Berta threw her back out.\\
91 - Oh, no. What should we do?\\
92 - Well, I called a chiropractor.\\
93 - Great.\\
94 - Oh, me! Oh...\\
95 - Duh. [chuckles]\\
96 - Well, uh, let's see what we got here.\\
97 - Where's the pain?\\
98 - Standing in front of me asking stupid questions.\\
99 - Berta, be nice. Alan's a doctor.\\
100 - [laughing]: Oh. Oh.\\
101 - Yes, yes, ha-ha.\\
102 - But I can help you.\\
103 - Although I am legally obligated to tell you\\
104 - my license has expired.\\
105 - But thankfully backs haven't changed that much\\
106 - since my unsuccessful board review. [chuckles]\\
107 - So, uh, you can't move at all?\\
108 - Every time I do, it tightens up more.\\
109 - Oh, sounds like a classic back spasm.\\
110 - You probably just need bed rest and ice, uh,\\
111 - but, just in case, let me see if you need a spinal adjustment.\\
112 - Touch me and you die.\\
113 - [quietly]: She may also need an attitude adjustment.\\
114 - Okay, I'll call my doctor and have him come take a look.\\
115 - [scoffs] Western medicine. He'll probably just prescribe pain killers.\\
116 - Call him.\\
117 - I will. In the meantime,\\
118 - you stay here as long as you need.\\
119 - I'll take the guest room.\\
120 - Why? My back's out but my front still works.\\
121 - Be like Sturgis all over again.\\
122 - [chuckles] Oh...\\
123 - Morning.\\
124 - Hey.\\
125 - Hey, were you alone last night?\\
126 - Yeah, why?\\
127 - Because from 11:15 to 11:22,\\
128 - all I heard was, "Oh, yeah,\\
129 - that's the way Daddy likes it."\\
130 - Oh, um...\\
131 - Uh, right, the-the walls are really thin,\\
132 - uh, between my bedroom and the guest room,\\
133 - and I-I was watching TV.\\
134 - Hmm.\\
135 - So the same show came on again at 1:30\\
136 - and then again at 4:15?\\
137 - Huh. [scoffs]\\
138 - Weird. [chuckles]\\
139 - Can I ask you something?\\
140 - Mm-hmm.\\
141 - What is wrong with Daddy?\\
142 - He's lonely, okay?\\
143 - Can you just let it go?\\
144 - I should ask you the same question.\\
145 - What are you doing?\\
146 - Well, since Berta is incapacitated,\\
147 - I have taken the initiative to design and build a chore wheel.\\
148 - What is a chore wheel?\\
149 - It is a wheel with a variety of chores on the outside\\
150 - and names on the inside.\\
151 - I got the idea from my brother Charlie,\\
152 - who had a whore wheel.\\
153 - The only name on it is "Walden."\\
154 - Ah, that's because it was my chore to make the chore wheel.\\
155 - And your first chore\\
156 - is...\\
157 - "cleaning Alan's room."\\
158 - [sucks air through teeth] Ooh.\\
159 - That's gonna be tough after last night.\\
160 - Maybe you should have Daddy do it.\\
161 - Whoa, somebody found my stash.\\
162 - Wasn't hard. It was right here in this box\\
163 - that says "Not Pot." [chuckles]\\
164 - Very clever.\\
165 - I didn't want anybody to find my pot.\\
166 - I was about to write, uh,\\
167 - "This Box Contains Poisonous Jumping Bugs,"\\
168 - but then I thought, "What if this magic marker\\
169 - "is actually magic and it turns my pot\\
170 - into poisonous jumping bugs?"\\
171 - [chuckles]\\
172 - I was really high.\\
173 - Uh, you know, I-I really don't think it's a good idea\\
174 - to mix marijuana with muscle relaxers.\\
175 - Oh, those pills are long gone.\\
176 - What? You had a good two weeks' worth.\\
177 - Or a great one night's worth. [chuckles]\\
178 - Oh, bacon.\\
179 - You guys take such good care of me.\\
180 - That's because you take good care of us.\\
181 - That's because I love you guys.\\
182 - I love you more. Shh!\\
183 - How's your back feeling?\\
184 - Actually, a lot better.\\
185 - I think I'm ready to go back to work.\\
186 - Oh, really? So you can get up?\\
187 - Absolutely. [chuckles]\\
188 - Am I up?\\
189 - No.\\
190 - Damn.\\
191 - How 'bout now?\\
192 - Yep, looking good.\\
193 - Told you.\\
194 - Hey! Bacon!\\
195 - Why do these have windows?\\
196 - I don't need to see inside.\\
197 - I trust 'em to wash and dry the clothes.\\
198 - You know, when you think about it,\\
199 - a lot of appliances have windows.\\
200 - Ovens,\\
201 - microwaves.\\
202 - Wait a minute. Are we watching them or are they watching us?\\
203 - Got a little contact high in there with Berta,\\
204 - did you? Shh!\\
205 - [whispers]: Not in front of the washer.\\
206 - Hey, how old do you think Berta is anyway?\\
207 - I don't even know her last name.\\
208 - You know, I'm just thinkin', I mean, she hurt her back.\\
209 - It's taking her a while to recover.\\
210 - I mean, maybe this job's just getting to be too much for her.\\
211 - Really?\\
212 - Yeah, I don't know.\\
213 - I mean, she's not getting any younger,\\
214 - and it's a pretty labor-intensive job.\\
215 - Why in the world do you wear boys' husky underwear?\\
216 - Okay, you know how some people trim the hedges\\
217 - to make the tree look bigger?\\
218 - Well, I say stuff the tree in a smaller yard.\\
219 - Well, when the police raid the house\\
220 - and find a drawer full of boys' underwear,\\
221 - that's not gonna be good for any of us.\\
222 - Neither is a drawer full of pot.\\
223 - That's why I wrote "Not Pot" on it.\\
224 - So are you saying you think it's time for Berta to retire?\\
225 - I don't know. Everyone slows down eventually.\\
226 - Mmm, maybe you're right.\\
227 - Maybe it's time to put the old girl out to pasture.\\
228 - Send her off to the housekeeper farm upstate.\\
229 - That might not be the best way to tell her.\\
230 - What? The-the farm is a beautiful place.\\
231 - She can run out in the fields with all the other housekeepers.\\
232 - There's sponges and fabric softener\\
233 - as far as the eye can see.\\
234 - And the only dishes left in the sink are made of chocolate.\\
235 - I may be a little stoned, too.\\
236 - You ever hear about the roommate farm?\\
237 - Berta.\\
238 - We got a little surprise for you.\\
239 - Chuck Norris?\\
240 - Fried chicken, cheesecake and beer.\\
241 - That's what my first husband requested for his last meal.\\
242 - Am I dying?\\
243 - Oh, don't be silly.\\
244 - Do you like farms?\\
245 - What? WALDEN: Oh.\\
246 - I-I think what he's trying to say is,\\
247 - have you ever thought about hanging up the old toilet brush?\\
248 - Raising that vest up to the rafters?\\
249 - Oh, my God, you're firing me.\\
250 - [chuckles] No. I-I would never fire you.\\
251 - I'm talking about retirement.\\
252 - Just kicking back,\\
253 - taking it easy, getting high every day.\\
254 - I do that now.\\
255 - Besides, I can't afford to retire.\\
256 - Well, what about that pension plan I set up for you?\\
257 - I'll tell you what happened to it: life.\\
258 - Your house needs a new roof,\\
259 - your grandson needs braces,\\
260 - your daughter's meth lab explodes.\\
261 - What were you planning on doing,\\
262 - working for the rest of your life?\\
263 - Nah, I thought about, uh, getting a villa in Tuscany.\\
264 - Then I said, "Nah, I'll just hang around here\\
265 - and clean the skid marks out of Zippy's underwear."\\
266 - How about this?\\
267 - What if you could make the same money you're making now\\
268 - and never have to work again?\\
269 - One last job? I like it.\\
270 - Am I driving or shooting?\\
271 - No. You retire,\\
272 - and I'll pay you for the rest of your life.\\
273 - You're gonna pay me for doing nothing?\\
274 - Yeah. I call it the Alan Harper Plan.\\
275 - Where's this coming from?\\
276 - Uh, we're-we're just... worried about you. Um...\\
277 - This is a tough job, especially for a woman of your age.\\
278 - What?\\
279 - He said it's hard for a woman your age to do this job.\\
280 - I heard him!\\
281 - Oh.\\
282 - I can do the job just fine.\\
283 - Really? Because you basically bent over\\
284 - and haven't been able to get out of bed for two days.\\
285 - So you just want to treat me like some pathetic charity case\\
286 - you can throw money at.\\
287 - Oh, no-no one's saying you're a charity case.\\
288 - Although, I, on the other hand,\\
289 - would be happy to be one of Walden's Kids.\\
290 - I'm just trying to do something nice for you.\\
291 - By giving me a handout?\\
292 - Unlike you, I've worked for every cent I ever made.\\
293 - Excuse me?\\
294 - You got rich from one idea.\\
295 - You have no clue what it's like to work for a living.\\
296 - Okay, I am not gonna apologize for being successful.\\
297 - No, you are not, my friend.\\
298 - Shut up! Shut up!\\
299 - And please, "work for a living"?\\
300 - You hurt your back trying to take a nap!\\
301 - You know what?\\
302 - I don't have to take this crap.\\
303 - Well, that makes two of us.\\
304 - It's settled then. I quit.\\
305 - Oh, no! Where am I gonna find someone to eat my food,\\
306 - smoke my pot and sleep in my bed?!\\
307 - Oh...\\
308 - Shut up!\\
309 - [sighs] So what do you think? Was I right, or what?\\
310 - Yes, Helen is great. Mm.\\
311 - Although I still don't understand\\
312 - why we couldn't at least interviewa topless maid.\\
313 - Or four.\\
314 - Will you forget about the topless maids?\\
315 - I will never forget about the topless maids.\\
316 - You saw the video.\\
317 - "The only thing dirty in your house will be me."\\
318 - [door opening]\\
319 - Supper time, boys.\\
320 - Oh. Oh.\\
321 - Helen, this lemonade is delicious.\\
322 - That's because I have a secret ingredient.\\
323 - Oh, really? What-What is it?\\
324 - Love.\\
325 - Aw! Oh!\\
326 - And, like, a pound of sugar.\\
327 - [sighs]\\
328 - Hey, you still miss Berta?\\
329 - Miss Berta who?\\
330 - Hey, maybe that's her last name, "Who."\\
331 - More like, "Who Cares."\\
332 - [laughter]\\
333 - Oh, my God, look at this!\\
334 - And for dessert,\\
335 - when your tummy starts to rumble,\\
336 - there's Helen's apple crumble.\\
337 - [laughs]\\
338 - Shut your mouth.\\
339 - I won't.\\
340 - You shouldn't.\\
341 - [laughter]\\
342 - The only thing Berta ever made with an apple was a bong.\\
343 - Oh, she sounds like a hoot-and-a-half.\\
344 - [laughter]\\
345 - Well, enjoy, boys!\\
346 - Oh, no, no, no, no, come join us.\\
347 - Oh.\\
348 - Well, thank you very much.\\
349 - Oh.\\
350 - The only thing sweeter\\
351 - than your manners is my peach cobbler.\\
352 - Spoiler alert-- tomorrow night.\\
353 - Well, I will be a gobbler of your cobbler.\\
354 - I am gonna stitch that on a pillow.\\
355 - Oh, do you... do you mind if I say grace?\\
356 - Oh. Yeah, sure, go ahead.\\
357 - Uh, should I eat this unblessed biscuit, or spit it out?\\
358 - Dear Lord,\\
359 - we thank you for the food that we are\\
360 - about to receive, and all of the other blessings\\
361 - that you have bestowed upon us.\\
362 - Hmm. That was beautiful.\\
363 - And we humbly ask\\
364 - that you help Alan and Walden\\
365 - find the path to righteousness.\\
366 - Wait.\\
367 - What?\\
368 - And lead them out\\
369 - of their sinful homosexual lifestyles...\\
370 - ...lest\\
371 - their souls burn in the fiery pits of hell\\
372 - for all eternity with all of the other Sodomites.\\
373 - Amen. Can I get some sweet potatoes?\\
374 - Oh, sure.\\
375 - Alan?\\
376 - What? She already thinks\\
377 - we're gobbling each others' cobblers.\\
378 - [humming]\\
379 - When you're finished with that dish,\\
380 - just leave it, and I'll take care of it.\\
381 - Oh, thank you, Colleen.\\
382 - No problem.\\
383 - I'm gonna go make the beds.\\
384 - I don't want to spoil the surprise,\\
385 - but I'm pretty sure she was carrying a little bag\\
386 -     of pillow chocolates.    \\
387 - I have to admit, she's pretty terrific.\\
388 - Right? I mean, she's a good cook, she's punctual.\\
389 - She's accepting of our lifestyle.\\
390 - There is no lifestyle to accept.\\
391 - But if things change, it's nice to know\\
392 - we won't lose a great housekeeper.\\
393 - [cell phone rings]\\
394 - That's-that's not me.\\
395 - Oh, uh, maybe it's Colleen.\\
396 - Um, Colleen?\\
397 - Oh, for the love of God, just turn it off.\\
398 - Oh, dear.\\
399 - What?\\
400 - Look at this.\\
401 - Oh!\\
402 - Okay, I'm-I'm sure there's a logical explanation for this.\\
403 - I mean, she's a... she's a single woman,\\
404 - probably just trying to protect herself.\\
405 - So, what's this one for?\\
406 - She has two guns?\\
407 - Uh...\\
408 - I count four...\\
409 - and what looks like a shank.\\
410 - Okay, you get to fire this one.\\
411 - COLLEEN: Did I hear my phone?\\
412 - [screaming]\\
413 - Alan has something he'd like to tell you.\\
414 - I think I made a pillow chocolate\\
415 - in my boys' huskies.\\
416 - Okay. Well, our last housekeeper,\\
417 - um, cleaned. Mm.\\
418 - And, uh, sometimes cooked for us.\\
419 - Is that something that you're comfortable with?\\
420 - Sure. What would you like me to cook?\\
421 - Oh, I-I don't know.\\
422 - For breakfast, I like pancakes. Mm-hmm.\\
423 - Of course. Pancakes!\\
424 - I'm... I'm-I'm sorry.\\
425 - You see an African-American woman,\\
426 - and the first thing you think is,\\
427 - "Aunt Jemima going to whip us up some flapjacks."\\
428 - WALDEN: Oh!\\
429 - No! No! No! No, no. Um...\\
430 - Do I need to bring my own bandana,\\
431 - or are you going to supply me with one?\\
432 - Oh, I'm-I'm sorry. We just, uh...\\
433 - You know, we really like pancakes. Yeah.\\
434 - But, you know, I suppose waffles are-are fine.Yeah, waffles.\\
435 - Chickenand waffles?\\
436 - You know what? Let's...\\
437 - Let's just forget breakfast.\\
438 - I'll just... I'll just have coffee.\\
439 - How do you take it?\\
440 - Bla...\\
441 - I prefer tea.\\
442 - Um, so, are you okay with doing laundry?\\
443 - Yeah. And I suppose you want me\\
444 - to separate the whites from the colors.\\
445 - Um, but you are aware\\
446 - you're applying for a job as a housekeeper?\\
447 - Oh, so, now I don't know why I'm here?\\
448 - Um, I'm not sure you do.\\
449 - What?! Okay, okay. Let's...\\
450 - Everybody just calm down.\\
451 - Oh, so now I've got to calm down\\
452 - just because I was diagnosed with schizophrenia?!\\
453 - Can you believe these fools, Donny?\\
454 - Okay, I think we have all the information we need.\\
455 - Mm-hmm. Um... we'll be in touch.\\
456 - Great.\\
457 - Let me know if you need any references.\\
458 - Oh, you all have a lovely home.\\
459 - [laughs]\\
460 - Donny, come on now!\\
461 - No, no. You know what? I changed my mind.\\
462 - I don't want to talk to Berta.\\
463 - Too bad. You wouldn't let a topless maid make your bed,\\
464 - and now you've got to lie in it.\\
465 - All right, well, I am not going to apologize.\\
466 - You won't have to.\\
467 - She said if you made an effort and came to her,\\
468 - that she'd be more than happy to apologize to you.\\
469 - Zippy says you want to apologize.\\
470 - See what I did there? Can we come in?\\
471 - No, place is a mess.\\
472 - I was a jerk to my housekeeper, so she quit.\\
473 - Okay, that's it. I'm out of here.\\
474 - Oh, come on, Walden! Is it that difficult to say you're sorry?\\
475 - It is when you have nothing to say you're sorry for.\\
476 - Are you that clueless? You hurt my feelings.\\
477 - You hurt myfeelings, andyou smoked all my pot,\\
478 - so I had no way of not feeling what I was feeling.\\
479 - Okay, okay, dialogue is good.\\
480 - Now let's see if we can find some common ground.\\
481 - You're an idiot.\\
482 - Agree.\\
483 - Look, I... I...\\
484 - was trying to help you because I care about you.\\
485 - Not because I see you as a charity case.\\
486 - And I'm sorry if you got the wrong impression.\\
487 - I'm sorry I overreacted.\\
488 - Besides, I was so high,\\
489 - I thought you were a talking dragon.\\
490 - It is really good stuff.\\
491 - That's the stuff I give my grandkids at Christmas.\\
492 - It's funny 'cause I get it from a guy named Jesus.\\
493 - So, what do you say? Will you come back?\\
494 - I don't know.\\
495 - You may be right.\\
496 - I might not be able to do everything I used to do.\\
497 - Well, we'll work around it, right?\\
498 - Oh, absolutely. What-whatever it takes.\\
499 - Deal?\\
500 - Deal.\\
501 - Come on in, I'll make you a cup of coffee.\\
502 - [laughing]\\
503 - Not funny!\\
504 - Mm.\\
505 - [laughing]\\
506 - Still not funny!\\
507 - I'm glad you're back.\\
508 - Me, too, and I really appreciate you getting me some help.\\
509 - It's the least I could do.\\
510 - And I have to admit,\\
511 - Alan was right about hiring a topless maid.\\
512 - Oh.\\
513 - If it wasn't in the hamper, it's not going in the washer.\\

1 - Hey.\\
2 - Hey.\\
3 - What you working on?\\
4 - Anything interesting?\\
5 - Yeah, actually.\\
6 - I'm-I'm building a new algorithm\\
7 - that weights search results...\\
8 - I'm gonna get laid.\\
9 - Congratulations. Which hand are you going to use?\\
10 - That's, uh... that's funny.\\
11 - Because, um, you know, if someone were to look\\
12 - at the two of us,\\
13 - they'd probably think I'd be the one sitting home\\
14 - on a Friday night babbling on about some geek nonsense,\\
15 - and you'd be the one going out to,\\
16 - you know, get laid.\\
17 - Who's the "lucky lady"?\\
18 - Lyndsey is the lucky...\\
19 - getting "laid-y."\\
20 - Doesn't it bother you that after she's with you,\\
21 - she goes home to her more handsome,\\
22 - successful boyfriend?\\
23 - Why? I do the same thing.\\
24 - How did Lyndsey end up with him?\\
25 - Well, how did Iend up with him?\\
26 - Hey, Walden.\\
27 - Hey.\\
28 - Michaela, Heidi, Sarah, this is Walden.\\
29 - He's super hot, super rich and super single.\\
30 - These are my friends, and we are all super high.\\
31 - Nice to meet you.\\
32 - Hi. Nice house.\\
33 - [laughing]: I am so wasted.\\
34 - What are you guys doing tonight?\\
35 - Oh, we're gonna play poker.\\
36 - You want to join?\\
37 - Yeah, come play with us!\\
38 - It'll be fun.I am so wasted.\\
39 - You know what, I-I actually have a lot of work to do,\\
40 - and need to get to bed early, but...\\
41 - you guys have fun.\\
42 - [gasps] We should play strip poker.\\
43 - Yes.\\
44 - All right, ante up.\\
45 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
46 -     Ah.         Men.         Men.    \\
47 - Hey.\\
48 - All right, let's get it over with.\\
49 - Tell me all the disturbing details of how you "got laid."\\
50 - She never showed.\\
51 - She couldn't get away from Larry, so I spent half the night\\
52 - waiting for her in the parking lot of an ampm.\\
53 - Wow, I'm actually enjoying one of your stories.\\
54 - Please, continue.\\
55 - But on the plus side,\\
56 - at 12:01, all the donuts became half price.\\
57 - By 12:19, I-I had made friends with the guy\\
58 - who lives in the men's room, Raul.\\
59 - Is he looking for a roommate?\\
60 - You laugh, but he actually turned the changing table\\
61 - into a Murphy bed.\\
62 - I'm sorry, but if I remember correctly,\\
63 - last night, you were pretty sure\\
64 - that you were going to "get laid."\\
65 - But, in fact, you didn't "get laid."\\
66 - Are you done?\\
67 - Are you done not "getting laid"?\\
68 - [sighs]\\
69 - Seriously, why are you doing this?\\
70 - Because I get to have sex with Lyndsey.\\
71 - But you didn't have sex.\\
72 - You ended up shame-eating stale donuts\\
73 - and talking to a homeless guy in a men's room.\\
74 - They were not stale, and Raul has a name.\\
75 - You can't let Lyndsey treat you like this.\\
76 - You deserve better.\\
77 - I know. Raul said the same thing.\\
78 - Well, I had a great night last night.\\
79 - I ended up playing strip poker\\
80 - with four incredibly beautiful women.\\
81 - Oh, yeah, I've been on that site.\\
82 - No, it was Jenny and her friends.\\
83 - What a sec, is that the charge on my card\\
84 - for TexasSqueezeEm.com?\\
85 - Wait, you played strip poker with my niece?\\
86 - She was the dealer.\\
87 - But she did flop a great pair.\\
88 - Walden, Jenny is family.\\
89 - If you cross that line,\\
90 - I am not gonna be your friend anymore.\\
91 - I mean, I'm still gonna live here,\\
92 - but I'm not gonna be your friend anymore.\\
93 - Relax, it was harmless fun.\\
94 - JENNY: Hey!\\
95 - Look who's got his clothes on.Uh...\\
96 - I had clothes on last night.\\
97 - Yeah, you were wearing a sock.\\
98 - And not on your foot.\\
99 - It looked like Santa filled\\
100 - a stocking at Elton John's house.\\
101 - "Harmless fun"?\\
102 - No, she did not see Bennie or the Jets.\\
103 - Hey, we're gonna hang out again tonight\\
104 - if you want to join us.Yeah, sure.\\
105 - Cool. I'll see you at 11:00.\\
106 - What, 11:00?\\
107 - What is it, New Year's Eve?\\
108 - [laughs]\\
109 - Bring your sock.\\
110 - You're not really going out with them, are you?\\
111 - Is this about Jenny? Will you stop it?\\
112 - I'm not the creepy guy who wants to sleep with your niece.\\
113 - I'm the creepy guy who wants to sleep\\
114 - with your niece's friends.\\
115 - And don't you think that's a little sad?\\
116 - I mean, a 35-year-old man hanging out with a bunch\\
117 - of hot young girls who just want to drink, party, get naked...\\
118 - and anything I say after this point\\
119 - doesn't really matter, does it?\\
120 - It doesn't.\\
121 - I've never had this in my life.\\
122 - Wh-When I was her age, I'd already dropped out of M.I.T.,\\
123 - gotten married and started my own business.\\
124 - I was delivering pizza, going to junior college\\
125 - and dating a melon.\\
126 - Oh, God!\\
127 - I called her my little honeydew.\\
128 - Walden?\\
129 - I'm up. Let's party.\\
130 - Jagerbombs, bottle service.\\
131 - What's going on? I thought you were going out with the girls.\\
132 - I am, but not until 11:00.\\
133 - What is it... 9:00?\\
134 - How can I be so sleepy?\\
135 - I've already had two naps and three Red Bulls.\\
136 - Uh, my brother Charlie had a great trick for staying awake.\\
137 - Two hookers and an eight ball.\\
138 - I'll pass.\\
139 - What's with the bag?\\
140 - Oh, my God, are you moving in with Raul?\\
141 - No, Lyndsey felt guilty about last night\\
142 - and Larry is on a business trip,\\
143 - so she is treating me to a romantic rendezvous\\
144 - at a four-star hotel at the beach.\\
145 - Oh, come on, man.\\
146 - She's treating you like a piece of meat.\\
147 - I know, it's great.\\
148 - Plus, I have already masturbated so I can hit the sweet spot\\
149 - between "you're done already?" and "enough already."\\
150 - Enough already.\\
151 - Don't worry, I'll talk to her.\\
152 - Okay, well, good luck.\\
153 - And give Lyndsey my best.\\
154 - Sure, right after I give her my best.\\
155 - Boo-ya!\\
156 - Hi.\\
157 - Oh, so you did decide to show up tonight.\\
158 - I know. Sorry I'm late.\\
159 - It's fine.\\
160 - You just turned happy hour into miffed hour.\\
161 - And four-dollar pot stickers into eight-dollar pot stickers.\\
162 - Well, the important thing is I'm here now,\\
163 - and you look really nice tonight.\\
164 - Did you do something different with your hair?\\
165 - You don't have to flatter me.\\
166 - You know I'm gonna give it up.\\
167 - But we do need to talk.\\
168 - I said I was sorry.\\
169 - It's not just that; it's everything.\\
170 - It's the... it's the sneaking around,\\
171 - it's the curt texts, it's the going Dutch.\\
172 - Alan, you know this is complicated.\\
173 - I have a boyfriend.\\
174 - Yes, and I have feelings.\\
175 - And I am feeling disrespected.\\
176 - I hear you, and I will work harder\\
177 - to make sure that you don't feel taken for granted.\\
178 - Thank you.\\
179 - Now, why don't we go up to our room\\
180 - and respectfully disrespect each other?\\
181 - Ooh, someone wants a spanking.\\
182 - I know.\\
183 - Can it be me this time?\\
184 - Oh, yeah, we can play naughty school girl\\
185 - and no-nonsense math teacher.\\
186 - Oh, no.\\
187 - Oh, yes, 138 divided by two is 69.\\
188 - No.\\
189 - It's Stephanie Chapman.\\
190 - Shh. Maybe she won't see us.\\
191 - Lyndsey, Alan!\\
192 - Stephanie, hi.\\
193 - Oh, wow, uh, l-look at you, you look great.\\
194 - I should. I got the Lap-Band, and I dropped 172 pounds.\\
195 - Oh.Good for you.\\
196 - Hold your applause till the end.\\
197 - This is the end.\\
198 - So, what are you two doing here?\\
199 - Oh, well...There...\\
200 - Are you guys back together?\\
201 - No, no, we're just...Did you split up with Larry?\\
202 - No, Alan and I are just friends and...\\
203 - Wine, hotel?\\
204 - [singsongy]: I smell a hookup.\\
205 - Oh, we are... we are definitely not together.\\
206 - Wh-What you smell are eight-dollar pot stickers.\\
207 - So, wh-what brings you here?\\
208 - Uh, there is a singles' mixer, and this former fatty\\
209 - is looking for a sugar daddy.\\
210 - Make sure he's a-a sugar-free daddy.\\
211 - [giggles]\\
212 - You are adorable. I could just eat you up.\\
213 - I don't know, I'd probably just taste like chicken.\\
214 - Mmm, I'll bring the biscuits and you bring the gravy.\\
215 - Okay, I'm gonna leave you two "friends" alone.\\
216 - Hashtag "suspicious."\\
217 - Great seeing you.\\
218 - You, too.Oh, take care.\\
219 - I know you're gonna hate\\
220 - to see me go, but you're gonna love\\
221 - watching me walk away.\\
222 - Oh, God.\\
223 - She is the most annoying woman on the planet.\\
224 - Yeah, she is horrible.\\
225 - You have to go out with her.\\
226 - Hmm? What?\\
227 - She totally suspects\\
228 - we're having an affair.\\
229 - The only way to convince her we're not a couple\\
230 - is for you to ask her out.\\
231 - No.\\
232 - Forget her stomach.\\
233 - They should've stapled her mouth shut.\\
234 - That's exactly the problem.\\
235 - She'll tell Larry.\\
236 - Oh-oh, no, no, there-there has to be an easier way.\\
237 - Can't I just kill her?\\
238 - It'd be a much smaller grave to dig now.\\
239 - I'm serious, if you ever want to have sex with me again,\\
240 - you will ask her out.\\
241 - Oh, fine, fine, I'll-I'll ask her out.\\
242 - Now let's go upstairs.\\
243 - Oh, it's not gonna happen.\\
244 - She's right over there.\\
245 - I'm going home.\\
246 - But-but I thought we were gonna...\\
247 - Good-bye.\\
248 - [huffs]\\
249 - [laughter, clamoring]\\
250 - Wow, this is a beautiful house!\\
251 - Who lives here?\\
252 - You do.\\
253 - Whoa, I must be rich!\\
254 - You are.\\
255 - Oh, yeah!\\
256 - Whoa, my fingers are glowing!\\
257 - I'm so rich I have rainbow fingers!\\
258 - Hey, let's get some music going.\\
259 - Yeah!Yeah!\\
260 - Oh!\\
261 - This is the greatest song I've ever heard!\\
262 - Walden? Jenny?\\
263 - It-it's 3:00 in the morning.\\
264 - I know, and I'm still awake!\\
265 - And I'm still wasted!\\
266 - Oh, no, your fingers aren't glowing!\\
267 - Oh, that's because he's poor.\\
268 - Oh, I am sorry, Alan.\\
269 - Whoa!\\
270 - Your skin is so soft.\\
271 - Guys, feel Alan's skin. It's so soft.\\
272 - Whoa!It's so soft.\\
273 - It's so soft.Okay, okay, okay!\\
274 - Everybody stop touching me.\\
275 - Except you.\\
276 - Hi. I'm Alan.\\
277 - Alan, I'm high.\\
278 - What-what is going on?\\
279 - Oh, Alan, we were at a party,\\
280 - and we were drinking and smoking,\\
281 - and then I ate a tiny pill off of someone's nipple.\\
282 - It was like a nipple Pez dispenser.\\
283 - Okay, okay, it's time for the party to end,\\
284 - and everybody to just sleep this off.\\
285 - Yeah, Alan's right.\\
286 - We should get naked and go skinny-dipping in the ocean!\\
287 - Yeah, Sarah's right. Come on.\\
288 - [women whooping]\\
289 - Ha-ha! Yes!\\
290 - He's going skinny-dipping with the hot chicks,\\
291 - and my girlfriend's banging another dude.\\
292 - Can you throw me a bone, God?\\
293 - [thumping nearby]\\
294 - Oh, I didn't forget about you, Alan.\\
295 - There's a new melon in the fridge.\\
296 - [chuckles]\\
297 - Oh, crap.\\
298 -     Men.   \\
299 - Don't be naked, don't be naked.\\
300 - Damn.\\
301 - Don't be naked, don't be naked.\\
302 - Damn.\\
303 - Damn!\\
304 - Whoa!\\
305 - Whoa.\\
306 - Whoa!\\
307 - Morning.\\
308 - We're naked.\\
309 - Yes, we are.\\
310 - How did we get here?\\
311 - The last thing I remember\\
312 - was asking some chick,\\
313 - "Can you mix these with alcohol?"\\
314 - Apparently the answer is no.\\
315 - Okay, 'cause the... 'cause the last thing I remember\\
316 - is you looking in a mirror saying,\\
317 - "Can we mix these with alcohol?"\\
318 - [laughs] Don't worry.\\
319 - Nothing could've happened.\\
320 - I'm gay.\\
321 - Ah, that's right.\\
322 - You're gay. [laughs]\\
323 - Wait.\\
324 - How gay?\\
325 - Like, one being, "Yay, it's college!"\\
326 - Or ten being, "I'm going Subaru shopping\\
327 - with Ellen and Rosie."\\
328 - I'm closer to a nine.\\
329 - I mean, I make my own soap,\\
330 - but I don't sell it at the Lilith Fair.\\
331 - Oh, great, great.\\
332 - I mean, granted you're prettier\\
333 - than a lot of the women I've dated,\\
334 - ut you have an outie and I'm into innies.\\
335 - Okay, okay, so we didn't have sex.\\
336 - That is a load off.\\
337 - Uh, that's a poor choice of words.\\
338 - Although sometimes I date an innie\\
339 - who has an outtie in her purse.\\
340 - What is that supposed to mean?\\
341 - I don't know, I'm just saying it's possible.\\
342 - Oh, God, if Alan finds out, he's gonna freak out.\\
343 - He won't move out, but he will freak out.\\
344 - Okay, settle down.\\
345 - We don't even know if there's anything to freak out about.\\
346 - [stammers] Hello.\\
347 - Hello. Stop that!\\
348 - We got to figure out what to do.\\
349 - Okay, what we're gonna do\\
350 - is never talk about this again.\\
351 - So, you're just saying deny\\
352 - that we ever woke up in bed naked together?\\
353 - I have a motto for situations like this.\\
354 - What happens in Jenny,\\
355 - stays in Jenny.\\
356 - So, I was really surprised you called me.\\
357 - Well, I-I couldn't get your voice out of my head.\\
358 - You're not the first one to say that.\\
359 - There it goes again.\\
360 - No, I was surprised because I was vibing there was\\
361 - definitely something going on between you and Lyndsey.\\
362 - No, we're-we're just friends.\\
363 - And-and barely that.\\
364 - She's a drunk, you know?\\
365 - Oh, believe me, I know.\\
366 - You should hear wine bottles in her trash bins\\
367 - on Friday morning.Mm-hmm.\\
368 - I mean, clank, clank, drunken skank!\\
369 - Yeah, she's a whore, too.\\
370 - I don't know why she ever let you go.\\
371 - You are quite the catch.\\
372 - Uh, I know I present that way,\\
373 - but I'm more catch and release.\\
374 - Well, I am not releasing.\\
375 - [high-pitched whoosh]\\
376 - [clicks tongue]\\
377 - [laughs]\\
378 - You are so cute.\\
379 - Thank you. Uh, you're not eating your food.\\
380 - Do you not like Souplantation?\\
381 - No, I love it, but since the surgery,\\
382 - I can't eat a portion larger than my fist.\\
383 - But don't worry.\\
384 - That only applies to food.\\
385 - How are you still single?\\
386 - Hey.\\
387 - Hey.\\
388 - So, listen.\\
389 - Uh, about that thing that didn't happen...\\
390 - I have a way to figure out if it happened.\\
391 - I'm not peeing on any sticks.\\
392 - No.\\
393 - There is a camera in my room.\\
394 - [sighs]\\
395 - And that's why I don't sleep with guys.\\
396 - It was your dad's.\\
397 - And that's why I drink.\\
398 - So we could watch the video back\\
399 - and know for sure.\\
400 - Or...\\
401 - we could erase it\\
402 - and continue to deny that anything ever happened.\\
403 - Play it.\\
404 - Ah, damn it.\\
405 - I was sure you were gonna say erase it.\\
406 - No, I want to watch it.\\
407 - It'll be like a quarterback watching game film.\\
408 - Only the quarterback's a lesbian.\\
409 - And the game's boning a dude.\\
410 - Exactly.\\
411 - Okay.\\
412 - Here we go.\\
413 - [sighs]\\
414 - Wait! Erase it?\\
415 - No, I want to make popcorn.\\
416 - So both of my ex-husbands turned out to be gay.\\
417 - But the weird thing is... is after I divorced them,\\
418 - they both turned straight again.\\
419 - What are the odds?\\
420 - Uh, well, this has been great.\\
421 - Whoa, somebody's fresh.\\
422 - [laughs]\\
423 - Come on in.\\
424 - I would love to take you up on that,\\
425 - but, you know, it's, uh....\\
426 - 6:45...\\
427 - and, uh, I have got to go home\\
428 - and, uh, hit the hay.\\
429 - Oh, I have hay here.\\
430 - And I will definitely let you "hit it."\\
431 - That is tempting.\\
432 - Uh, and I am definitely gonna have to come\\
433 - to terms with that while I'm in the monastery.\\
434 - All right, I get it.\\
435 - You're making excuses\\
436 - because you're still in love with Lyndsey.\\
437 - God, no, we're-we're just friends.\\
438 - Yeah, and I didn't just fart in your car.\\
439 - It's fine, okay? I get it.\\
440 - I just feel bad for her boyfriend.\\
441 - [groans] Wait!\\
442 - Uh, if-if I was still in love with Lyndsey,\\
443 - would I do this?\\
444 - Wow.\\
445 - Do that again, but keep your eyes open and say my name.\\
446 - [muffled]: Stephanie?\\

1 -     Men.   \\
2 - Oh.\\
3 - What are you doing, Alan?\\
4 - Gazing at you in the morning light.\\
5 - Aw, that's sweet.\\
6 - And creepy.\\
7 - I just... I can't remember\\
8 - the last time we woke up together.[chuckles]\\
9 - And we're not the only two up.\\
10 - Cock-a-doodle-doo, you.\\
11 - That's just creepy.\\
12 - Where you going?\\
13 - I have to pick Larry up from the airport.\\
14 - Oh, have Larry take a cab and stay here with me.\\
15 - I'll even give you $50 for the fare.\\
16 - [both laugh]\\
17 - All right, all right, I'll walk you out.\\
18 - Let me just tuck the old rooster back in the barn.\\
19 - [grunts]\\
20 - Oh.\\
21 - Oh. Hi.\\
22 - Jenny, this is Lyndsey.\\
23 - This is Lyndsey, too.It's Leslie.\\
24 - Oh, that's a pretty name.\\
25 - I really enjoyed myself last night.\\
26 - Well, I really enjoyed myself watching you enjoy yourself.\\
27 - Oh. Wow.\\
28 - Got a little traffic jam here.\\
29 - "Pretty lady pileup on the PCH in Malibu.\\
30 - I know at least one of them was rear-ended."\\
31 - Sorry, girls.\\
32 - This one's mine.\\
33 - I'll see you.Okay. Bye.\\
34 - Call me.Call me.\\
35 - Call me.[door shuts]\\

37 - I'm not calling.\\
38 - She's not calling.\\
39 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
40 -     Ah.         Men.         Men.    \\
41 - [moaning]Ow. Ow.\\
42 - Okay, okay. This is ridiculous. Why can't we go to a hotel?\\
43 - Are you gonna spring for a room?\\
44 - Traditionally, the mistress does not pay.\\
45 - I'm sorry. I just don't have a lot of time,\\
46 - and I have a lot of other errands to run.\\
47 - So I'm just an errand?\\
48 - No. But you are on my to-do list.\\
49 - So what do you say we do it in the backseat?\\
50 - Really? I'd say you're usually drunk\\
51 - before you let me do...Alan.\\
52 - I'm talking about the backseat of the car.\\
53 - Oh. Oh, sorry. Sure.\\
54 - Oh, there's a box of stuff back here.\\
55 - Just shove that junk in the trunk.\\
56 - I'm getting a lot of mixed messages here.\\
57 - Wh-What is this stuff anyway?\\
58 - Bunch of old clothes of Larry's.\\
59 - I'm giving them to Goodwill after I squeeze you in.\\
60 - I did that one on purpose.\\
61 - Mmm. This is nice stuff.\\
62 - I have to bring some stuff to Goodwill.\\
63 - Why don't I just take this, too?\\
64 - Really? What do you have to bring to Goodwill?\\
65 - Uh, all of my old clothes 'cause I just got a new wardrobe.\\
66 -     Men.   \\
67 - Morning.\\
68 - Afternoon.\\
69 - Oh, thank God. I thought I was drinking in the morning.\\
70 - Jenny...\\
71 - where do you see yourself in five years?\\
72 - Little house on the beach in Hawaii with Kate Upton.\\
73 - Wait, Kate Upton's straight.\\
74 - Give me two weeks.\\
75 - What I'm saying is, you didn't just move out here\\
76 - to party and drink, did you?\\
77 - Well, I want to be an actress, so...\\
78 - yeah.\\
79 - I mean, seriously, what are you doing about your career?\\
80 - Are you looking for an agent?\\
81 - Are you taking acting classes?\\
82 - Oh, my God. If I squint,\\
83 - you're, like, a prettier version of my mom.\\
84 - I'm pointing out that it's the middle of the day\\
85 - and you still haven't done a single thing yet.\\
86 - I could say the same thing about you.\\
87 - Oh. There.\\
88 - I just sold a company for $25 million.\\
89 - Really?\\
90 - No, I bought a Groupon for Indian food.\\
91 - But it's still more than you've done.\\
92 - ALAN: Oh, oh, sorry.\\
93 - What's that? Oh. Why, yes,\\
94 - it is a $5,000 Armani suit.\\
95 - Wow. $5,003 just walked into the room.\\
96 - It's one of Larry's old suits.\\
97 - He was gonna give it to charity, but I stole it just in time.\\
98 - [groans]\\
99 - Alan, you're going to hell.\\
100 - Yes, but you're going to Heaven, and I'll just be your plus-one.\\
101 - Sweet. Somebody else for you to judge.\\
102 - I'm gonna go Google Kate Upton.\\
103 - You're already having sex with this guy's girlfriend.\\
104 - Now you're wearing his clothes?\\
105 - I know. How awesome am I?\\
106 - I have a hot blonde girlfriend,\\
107 - a closet full of designer clothes\\
108 - and a beach house.\\
109 - Where to begin?\\
110 - Not your girlfriend, not your clothes\\
111 - and-- how many times do I have to say this?--\\
112 - it's not your beach house.\\
113 - In fact, if you took away\\
114 - everything that was Larry's or mine,\\
115 - you'd be alone on the street in your underwear.\\
116 - Actually, I'd be naked.\\
117 - Please tell me you're wearing Larry's underwear and not mine.\\
118 - Yes, they're Larry's.\\
119 - Although my bug is a little snug in his rug.\\
120 - King to rook four. Checkmate, Alan's penis.\\
121 - I don't think I've ever said this.\\
122 - In fact, I don't know if anyone has ever said this, but...\\
123 - Alan Harper, you're better than this.\\
124 - I'm just making the best of what I've got.\\
125 - You know, when life gives you lemons,\\
126 - you take the lemon's clothes\\
127 - and have sex with his girlfriend.\\
128 - Okay. Where do you see you and Lyndsey in five years?\\
129 - JENNY: Don't answer! It's a trap!\\
130 - All I'm saying is, is you deserve a real relationship.\\
131 - Well, what would you do if you were in my shoes?\\
132 - First, I'd give them back to Larry.\\
133 - And then I would tell Lyndsey that things have to change\\
134 - and I want more, and if she can't give me what I want,\\
135 - then I'm not gonna give her what she wants.\\
136 - You do know what she wants, though, right?\\
137 - Wham, wham, wham.\\
138 - That was sex.\\
139 - No, that was sad.\\
140 - But you know what?\\
141 - Hey, if you're happy, then so be it.\\
142 - No, no, no. You're right. I'm-I'm gonna tell her that...\\
143 - I want more, you know, that I'm not just a, you know,\\
144 - human vibrator.\\
145 - Although... how cool would that be?\\
146 - [buzzing]\\
147 - How bad must this Larry guy be in bed?\\
148 -     Men.   \\
149 - [exhales] That was amazing.\\
150 - Tell your friends.[chuckles]\\
151 - Although, were you buzzing at one point?\\
152 - Oh, yeah, sorry.\\
153 - I was just trying something new.\\
154 - No, no, whatever you did definitely worked.\\
155 - Alan Harper, pleasing women since 2003.\\
156 - That's when I got divorced.\\
157 - [chuckles] You always make me laugh.\\
158 - If that's the case, then be with me all the time.\\
159 - What?I want you back. I'm tired of being the other man.\\
160 - Oh, don't do this. We're having such a good time.\\
161 - Exactly. We have the best sex, I-I make you laugh...\\
162 - Often simultaneously.\\
163 - What could Larry possibly give you that I don't?\\
164 - There's just something about him.\\
165 - You'd have to know him to understand.\\
166 - He-he satisfies a different part of me.\\
167 - Point to it and I'll buzz it. [sighs]\\
168 - Alan, I know this is hard on you.\\
169 - And, yes, I know I said "hard on."\\
170 - I just want to see more of you.\\
171 - Okay, how about this?\\
172 - Larry takes spinning classes on Tuesday and Thursday nights.\\
173 - You can see more of me then.\\
174 - Fine.\\
175 - But I am not gonna be\\
176 - at your beck and call forever.\\
177 - I have my dignity.\\
178 - That would carry more weight if you weren't wearing\\
179 - Larry's underwear.\\
180 - Well, the joke's on you.\\
181 - This is Walden's underwear.\\
182 -     Men.   \\
183 - You have a second?\\
184 - I just finished my second.\\
185 - What I need is a third.\\
186 - I will fill your cup, but I will fill it\\
187 - with knowledge, potential and opportunity.\\
188 - But bourbon makes me feel smarter, prettier and taller.\\
189 - What is this?\\
190 - A friend of mine teaches an acting class,\\
191 - and there is a spot for you.Really?\\
192 - Yeah, this guy's the best.\\
193 - Here, check out his credits.\\
194 - CSI,urinating bum number three.\\
195 - Dexter,headless victim number two.\\
196 - That ain't easy.\\
197 - Why are you doing this?\\
198 - 'Cause I like you.\\
199 - And...\\
200 - I don't want you to wake up one day and realize\\
201 - that you've wasted your life and you have nothing to show for it.\\
202 - What I'm saying is,\\
203 - I don't want you to turn out like Alan.\\
204 - I don't want two Alans.\\
205 - I can't have two Alans.\\
206 - Okay, all right, all right, all right. Calm down.\\
207 - I'll-I'll go to the class, okay?\\
208 - Thank you.\\
209 - Uh, but you're gonna pay for it, right?\\
210 - Oh, it's starting already.\\
211 -     Men.   \\
212 - Alan, Larry's at spin class. Where are you?\\
213 - I can't make it. I-I think I've got food poisoning.\\
214 - Oh, no. What'd you eat?\\
215 - Well, I had some crappy crepes,\\
216 - and now I've got some crepe-y craps.\\
217 - Oh, that's awful.\\
218 - I hope you feel better.\\
219 - Thanks. Me, too.\\
220 - Tonight I'll be hugging the toilet,\\
221 - but I'll be thinking of you.\\
222 - Bye.\\
223 - Um, hey, is this bike taken?\\
224 - Nope, help yourself.\\
225 - Great. First-timer.\\
226 - Welcome. I'm Larry.\\
227 - I'm... Jeff.\\
228 - Nice to meet you, Jeff.\\
229 - So, you're a newbie, huh?\\
230 - Well, yeah, how hard can it be?\\
231 - It's just riding a bike. [grunts]\\
232 - Hey.\\
233 - I used to have those same exact shoes.\\
234 - Even had a hole in the same spot.\\
235 - [chuckles]\\
236 - Well, I've got my eye on the ones you're wearing.\\
237 -     Men.   \\
238 - [upbeat dance music playing]\\
239 - Isn't this great?\\
240 - Kill me!\\
241 - You got this.\\
242 - The only thing I've got is a blister\\
243 - in the space between my balls and my ass.\\
244 - Come on, Jeff. Don't quit!\\
245 - You can do it!\\
246 - I can't.\\
247 - Yes, you can!\\
248 - You can keep it up for a few more seconds!\\
249 - [panting] I'm doing it!\\
250 - I'm doing it! It's working!\\
251 - I'm a maniac!\\
252 - I'm a maniac!\\
253 - Attaboy. Don't go soft on me!\\
254 - Finish strong!\\
255 - [song ends]\\
256 - Whew.\\
257 - I was pedaling toward the light.\\
258 - It was so beautiful.\\
259 - My pop-pop was there.\\
260 - He was smoking his pipe.\\
261 - It smelled like cinnamon and cherries.\\
262 - Come on. Let's get you off this bike, Jeff.\\
263 - Who's Jeff?\\
264 - Boy, you really are out of it.\\
265 - Come on, we'll get you some water.\\
266 - Whoa, whoa, whoa! You're still clipped in there!\\
267 - Pop-Pop, help!\\
268 - Don't worry. I got you. I got you.\\
269 - Oh. You're so strong.\\
270 - I feel so safe.\\
271 - That was so much harder than I thought.\\
272 - But you did it.\\
273 - Uh, well, yeah, thanks to you.\\
274 - Nice job, Larry.\\
275 - See you Thursday?You know it.\\
276 - I can see why you like these cycling classes.\\
277 - Wouldn't mind taking her on a Tour de Pants.[chuckles]\\
278 - That's funny. But I actually got a girlfriend.\\
279 - Hey, I've got towels at home.\\
280 - Doesn't mean I'm not taking a couple of these with me.\\
281 - No, Lyndsey's great. Oh.\\
282 - I know what it's like to have a girl you're crazy about.\\
283 - I had a girl I would have killed for.\\
284 - You ever kill anybody, Larry?\\
285 - You're... you're hilarious.\\
286 - Yeah, I-I actually did dabble\\
287 - in stand-up comedy back in the '80s.\\
288 - I-I had this one bit about Nixon working in a diner.\\
289 - I am not a cook.\\
290 - [laughs]\\
291 - The '80s? What, were you, like, five?\\
292 - [phone ringing]\\
293 - Wow.\\
294 - There really is something about him.\\
295 - Uh, do you need to answer that?\\
296 - No, it's just a work call.\\
297 - Wait. Does that say... does that say "Billy Joel"?\\
298 - Oh, yeah, yeah. I manage musicians,\\
299 - so I'm trying to sign him, but I'll call him back.\\
300 - I'm talking to you.\\
301 - But he's a rock star.\\
302 - Rock stars aren't so impressive\\
303 - when they've had a bottle of white, a bottle of red\\
304 - and they're peeing in your koi pond.\\
305 - What do you do, Jeff?\\
306 - Oh, I'm just a-a chiropractor.\\
307 - Just a chiropractor?\\
308 - Your hands heal.\\
309 - You know what these hands do?\\
310 - They roll over drummers before they choke on their own vomit.\\
311 - I make people fart when I press down on their backs.\\
312 - [laughs] Hey, I'm gonna grab a smoothie.\\
313 - You want to...? Oh, I should probably head...\\
314 - My treat. ...over to the smoothie bar\\
315 - with my new friend Larry.\\
316 - I swear, I had that same shirt, too.\\
317 - Looks like we're into a lot of the same things.\\
318 -     Men.   \\
319 - Hey.\\
320 - Whoa! Where were you?\\
321 - Lance Armstrong's gay Halloween party?\\
322 - Very funny.\\
323 - Wait.\\
324 - Is that a thing? Did you get invited?\\
325 - No. Where were you?\\
326 - Oh, I was at spin class with Lyndsey's boyfriend.\\
327 - Should I ask why or just wait to see it on 48 Hours?\\
328 - I simply wanted to find out what he's got that I don't.\\
329 - Other than... mental health, pride and his own underwear?\\
330 - That's just it. He does have it all.\\
331 - I can totally see why Lyndsey loves him.\\
332 - He's-he's kind, he's generous,\\
333 - he's got a smile that lights up a juice bar.\\
334 - And-and the kicker is, he likes me.\\
335 - And did his smile light up\\
336 - when you told him you were plowing his girlfriend?\\
337 - No. Alanis plowing his girlfriend.\\
338 - Larry's friend, Jeff, will be joining him\\
339 - in his luxury box at the Laker game tomorrow night.\\
340 - [laughs]\\
341 - I-I just have to cancel my plans with Lyndsey.\\
342 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
343 - You're telling me you would rather spend the evening\\
344 - in Larry'sbox?\\
345 - Hey. Hey. How'd the acting class go?\\
346 - It was great.\\
347 - We did this improv exercise\\
348 - where I had to pretend to be high.\\
349 - I nailed it.\\
350 - Oh, uh, you know, in college, uh,\\
351 - I-I did a little musical theatre.\\
352 - And the winner\\
353 - for the least surprising sentence ever goes to...\\
354 - Alan Harper!\\
355 - Scoff if you will, but, uh,\\
356 - I actually starred in our production of Cats.\\
357 - And the new winner for least surprising sentence ever...\\
358 - Okay, I will have you know that the campus newspaper said\\
359 - that my portrayal of Rum Tum Tugger\\
360 - was purrfect.\\
361 - I've never seen Cats.\\
362 - You've never seen...?\\
363 -     The Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat.    \\
364 - Well, if you're coming out of the closet,\\
365 - come out dancing.\\
366 -     Men.   \\
367 - Boy, this really makes you feel like a man, doesn't it?\\
368 - Basketball, cheerleaders, a crisp Pinot Noir.\\
369 - There's beer in the fridge, too.\\
370 - What? And undo all that spinning? Oh, no.\\
371 - A second on the lips, a month on the hips.\\
372 - [laughs]\\
373 - Did you ever do this gay character in your stand-up?\\
374 - Yeah. It was a real crowd-pleaser.\\
375 - I, uh... I also do a-a character who's really cheap.\\
376 - [laughs] "Hey, is everything here free? Even those shrimp?"\\
377 - Nice.\\
378 - If I kept going, I'd say, "Hey, uh,\\
379 - can I get a to-go container?"\\
380 - Help yourself, you cheap queer.\\
381 - [laughs]\\
382 - Hey, uh, can I get a to-go container?\\
383 - [laughs]\\
384 - Hope we don't end up on the Kiss Cam.\\
385 - I've been told my kisses are like French fries.\\
386 - Can't stop with just one.\\
387 - [laughs]\\
388 - LARRY: Lyndsey, what a surprise!\\
389 - Lyndsey?\\
390 - Hey, sweetie. My plans fell through.\\
391 - Well, now you can meet Jeff.\\
392 - Jeff, this is my girlfriend Lyndsey.\\
393 - He's always joking around. Get over here!\\
394 - Hi.\\
395 - Hi. So, this is the guy\\
396 - you were telling me about?\\
397 - Yes, uh, uh, Lyndsey, was it?\\
398 - Uh-huh.\\
399 - I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.\\
400 - This is Jeff. Jeff Strongman.\\
401 - Strongman? That's a unique name.\\
402 - Uh, it's-it's German.\\
403 - Uh, it's actually pronounced Strungmin.\\
404 - [clears throat]\\
405 - Strungmin?Mmm.\\
406 - It almost sounds made up, doesn't it?\\
407 - Yeah, well, it's not, so shut up.\\
408 - Sweetie, it-it's cold in here.\\
409 - I think I left a jacket in the car. Would you mind?\\
410 - Of course. [laughs]\\
411 - Hey, I can trust you alone with my girlfriend, right?\\
412 - If you can't, then my name's not Jeff Strungmin.\\
413 - [door closes]\\
414 - What the hell is going on, Jeff?\\
415 - Are you trying to break me and Larry up?\\
416 - No, I would never do that to Larry.\\
417 - Then what are you doing here?\\
418 - I just... I wanted to figure out what Larry has that I don't\\
419 - so that I could be more like him,\\
420 - and then you'd come back to me.\\
421 - Look, I already have a Larry.\\
422 - If you turned into Larry, I'd have to find another Alan.\\
423 - Really? Yes, you idiot!\\
424 - Don't you get it?\\
425 - No man has ever turned me on like you do.\\
426 - It's a gift and a curse.\\
427 - Shut up.\\
428 - I'll stop talking, but I won't stop...\\
429 - [imitates buzzing]No, stop it.\\
430 - [imitates buzzing]\\
431 - I'm still mad at you!\\
432 - Well, I don't blame you.\\
433 - I have been very naughty.\\
434 - Perhaps I should be punished.\\
435 - Let's go.\\
436 - What...? Wait. Where?\\
437 - We'll do it in the bathroom.\\
438 - Seriously? Oh, yeah.\\
439 - Beats the hell out of the Kiss Cam.\\
440 -     Men.   \\
441 - Hey.\\
442 - Hey.\\
443 - How did the acting class go?\\
444 - I didn't go.\\
445 - [loudly]: Liar!\\
446 - I talked to my friend, and he said you didn'tgo,\\
447 - so admit it!\\
448 - I just did.\\
449 - I know!\\
450 - And I wasn't prepared for that.\\
451 - I went to the first class, but it was lame.\\
452 - It doesn't meant that you're not gonna learn something from it.\\
453 - Do you think that I just said, "Oh, I have a software idea\\
454 - and I'm gonna sell it for a billion dollars the next day"?\\
455 - I Googled you. That is what happened.\\
456 - The point is, is that, if-if that hadn't happened,\\
457 - I would have been willing to work for it.\\
458 - Look, I-I get it,\\
459 - but all this touchy-feely stuff just freaks me out.\\
460 - Half the reason I got into acting\\
461 - was so I could pretend to be someone else,\\
462 - not so I could spend time thinking about\\
463 - how I don't get along with my mom.\\
464 - And how I never knew my father.\\
465 - How I'm 25 years old\\
466 - and living in the guest room of a stranger's house.\\
467 - [sighs]\\
468 - I'm sorry.\\
469 - I didn't mean to stir all this up. I just...\\
470 - And that's why I don't need acting lessons.\\
471 - You know what?\\
472 - If you don't want\\
473 - to help yourself, I can't force you.\\
474 - But the choices that you make today\\
475 - are going to affect you for the rest of your life.\\
476 - And as long as you live under my roof...\\
477 - Oh, God, kill me.\\
478 -     Men.   \\
479 - [moaning]\\
480 - Is everything okay? Yeah.\\
481 - The only thing I can feel in your pants\\
482 - is the shrimp that you stole.\\
483 - I'm sorry. I'm-I'm just nervous.\\
484 - Can you do this or not?\\
485 - I don't think so.\\
486 - I mean, what would Larry say?\\
487 - LARRY: Come on, Jeff. Don't quit.\\
488 - What?\\
489 - I didn't say anything.\\
490 - LARRY: You can do it.\\
491 - Yes, you can.\\
492 - You know what? Maybe I can do this.\\
493 - Really?\\
494 - LARRY: Attaboy.\\
495 - Don't go soft on me.\\
496 - Go, Jeff, go.\\
497 - Oh, Alan.\\
498 - Call me Jeff.\\
499 -     Men.   \\
500 -     Men.   \\
501 - Guess who got an audition.\\
502 - Really?\\
503 - Yep.\\
504 - That's amazing. Tell me about it.\\
505 - Well, I went back to the acting class.\\
506 - [chuckles]\\
507 - Isn't that funny?\\
508 - The thing I suggested you do\\
509 - that you didn't want to do\\
510 - turned out to be the exact thing that you should have done.\\
511 - Yeah, well, after about an hour of that acting crap,\\
512 - I had to go get a drink.\\
513 - So, I bailed and went to a bar\\
514 - where I met a casting director.\\
515 - Turned out she was a lesbian, so I had a leg up.\\
516 - And when I put it down, I had an audition.\\
517 -     Men.   \\
518 - Oh.\\
519 - You have got to stop doing that.\\
520 - And you have to stop looking so pretty when you sleep.\\
521 - Okay, I heard it that time. It was creepy.\\
522 - You know what? I don't have to go anywhere today.\\
523 - Really?Yeah. Larry's got a friend picking him up at the airport.\\
524 - Oh, shoot! Shoot! Shoot!\\

87 - I know. Are you?\\
88 - Okay. All right, let's...\\
89 - go save some monkeys.\\
90 - [clears throat softly]\\
91 - Really?\\
92 - Hey, just 'cause you came out of it\\
93 - doesn't mean I don't want to get into it.\\
94 - [scoffs] They call these martinis?\\
95 - The only thing they're saving the monkeys from are DUI's.\\
96 - [laughing]\\
97 - You like that one?\\
98 - No, I was just picturing a drunk monkey driving a car.\\
99 - Walden.Mm.\\
100 - Oh.\\
101 - That woman with your mom looks just like Lynda Carter.\\
102 - [Alan laughs]\\
103 - That is Lynda Carter.\\
104 - Really?\\
105 - Wait, wait, T-TV's Wonder Woman?\\
106 - The jewel of Paradise Island?\\
107 - The-the shining crusader for justice and star- spangled hot pants?\\
108 - I-I just call her Lynda.\\
109 - And I just lost the cleaning deposit on this tux.\\
110 - Walden.\\
111 - Lynda, you look amazing.\\
112 - Oh, my God. The last time we saw each other,\\
113 - you barely came up to here.\\
114 - I remember those... days.\\
115 - [clearing throat]: Introduce me.\\
116 - Robin, you told me he was successful,\\
117 - but you didn't tell me how gorgeous he is.\\
118 - Well, it takes a gorgeous person to know one.\\
119 - [laughs]\\
120 - [nervous laughing]: No, it doesn't. I'm Alan.\\
121 - Hi.\\
122 - This is Alan Harper. He lives with Walden.Oh, well, it's lovely\\
123 - to meet you.\\
124 - My gay fans have always been my biggest supporters.\\
125 - Oh, oh, no, no, I-I'm not gay.\\
126 - Oh, I'm sorry. Transgender?\\
127 - I told you the hormones weren't working.\\
128 - [chuckles]\\
129 - He's kidding. Uh, I-I am very straight.\\
130 - In fact, the longer I look at you the straighter I become.\\
131 - Well, if you'll excuse us, I'm gonna start a fund\\
132 - to, um, save Lynda from this conversation.\\
133 - [giggles] It's lovely to meet you.\\
134 - And it was "wonder-ful" meeting you. [chuckles]\\
135 - That's funny. I've never heard thatone before.\\
136 - Don't be a stranger.Okay.\\
137 - Call me.[chuckles]\\
138 - What the hell are you doing?\\
139 - Sorry, I just wanted to put my mouth where her mouth was.\\
140 - And I also wanted to thank you for a lovely evening.\\
141 - Morning.\\
142 - Mm. I got to tell you,\\
143 - you gave me a night that I will never forget.\\
144 - Don't ever say that to me again.\\
145 - I'm serious. Meeting Lynda Carter was\\
146 - one of the greatest moments of my life.\\
147 - I mean, she was my first celebrity crush.\\
148 - I had a poster of her that looked like\\
149 - the bottom of a birdcage.\\
150 - On behalf of Lynda Carter and the rest of humanity...\\
151 - yuck.\\
152 - You know, it's not just about how beautiful she was.\\
153 - I mean, she's multitalented. I mean, I had all of her albums,\\
154 - I-I-I've seen everything she's ever done.\\
155 - How?\\
156 - Were you hiding outside her house in a bush?\\
157 - [snorting laugh]\\
158 - Lynda Carter's bush.\\
159 - Hey, you know, she's single.\\
160 - And?\\
161 - And? [laughs]\\
162 - Set me up with her.\\
163 - Can't I just... get you a new poster?\\
164 - I'll laminate it.\\
165 - Come on, come on.\\
166 - I-I-I have been in love with Lynda Carter for my whole life,\\
167 - and because you know her and I know you,\\
168 - I actually have a shot.\\
169 - I mean, this is fate.\\
170 - This is probably why my brother died.\\
171 - You said fate killed your brother\\
172 - so you could get that espresso machine.\\
173 - Come on!\\
174 - I'll see what I can do.\\
175 - Really?\\
176 - Yeah. Just don't get your hopes up.\\
177 - [scoffs]: Oh, of course not.\\
178 - Thank you.\\
179 - [quietly]: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the dance floor,\\
180 - for the first time as man and wife...\\
181 - Mr. and Mrs. Lynda Carter.\\
182 - Okay, great. All right, we'll see you soon.\\
183 - Hey.\\
184 - Was that her?\\
185 - Who?\\
186 - [high-pitched]:     Wonder Woman!    \\
187 -     For your friend, Alan Harper!    \\
188 - What are you doing?\\
189 - Oh, it's the Wonder Woman theme song.\\
190 - [high-pitched]:     Wonder Woman!    \\
191 -     You're a wonder, Wonder Woman!    \\
192 - Not familiar.\\
193 - You should be, 'cause it's...\\
194 -     Kind of awesome!    \\
195 - I was ordering a pizza.\\
196 - I haven't had a chance to talk to her yet.\\
197 - Why not?\\
198 -     Does your word mean nothin'?    \\
199 - You know what, uh, to be perfectly honest, I...\\
200 - I don't know if this is a good idea.\\
201 - What? Why?\\
202 - What-what's wrong with her? Is she crazy?\\
203 - I like crazy. You met Lyndsey-- that bitch is cuckoo.\\
204 - No, there's-there's nothing wrong with her.\\
205 - So what's the problem?\\
206 - She's... Lynda Carter.\\
207 - And?\\
208 - And you're...\\
209 - [high-pitched]:     Alan Harper!    \\
210 - Oh.\\
211 - Oh, I get it.\\
212 - You don't think I'm good enough for her.\\
213 - Oh, no, it's not that.\\
214 - No, no, no, no, no, it's fine, it's fine.\\
215 - Just out of curiosity, who amI good enough for?\\
216 - Lots of people.Well, name one.\\
217 - Okay, how about... how about the-the...\\
218 - the barista at the coffee place.\\
219 - The hot blonde, Vanessa?Oh, God, no. No, I'm...\\
220 - I'm...\\
221 - I'm talking about the other one.\\
222 - The only other one is Miguel.\\
223 - No. No, Tracy. The one with the brown hair.\\
224 - Coming out of her chin mole.\\
225 - Okay, then Miguel.\\
226 - [scoffs] I... I can't believe you think so little of me.\\
227 - It's not that.Oh, you know what? You know what?\\
228 - This is actually good. I finally know where I stand\\
229 - with my "friend."\\
230 - Okay, Alan...\\
231 - And you were gonna be our best man!\\
232 - Yeah, no, he's not good enough for Miguel.\\
233 -     Men.    \\
234 - [Jenny clears throat]\\
235 - Hey.\\
236 - Hey. You're up early.\\
237 - [sighs]: Yup. Crack of dawn.\\
238 - But, shh, Dawn is still sleeping.\\
239 - Good morning.\\
240 - Good morning.\\
241 - Uh, hey, Jenny, do you have any idea\\
242 - how to get tear stains out of pillows?\\
243 - It's certainly not more tears, because I tried that.\\
244 - Have you tried spraying\\
245 - some desperate cry for attention on it?\\
246 - You want some coffee?\\
247 - Why, yes, I would. Oh, uh, Walden,\\
248 - is there some uglier coffee\\
249 - that might be more appropriate for me?\\
250 - All right. Alan, you're being ridiculous.\\
251 - Hey, sticks and stones may break my bones,\\
252 - but thanks to you, I'll never bone Lynda Carter.\\
253 - Now, if you'll excuse me, I will breakfast alone in my room.\\
254 - What's wrong with Auntie Alan?\\
255 - She's pouting 'cause I won't set her up with Lynda Carter.\\
256 - Why not?Because, it's Lynda Carter.\\
257 - Right.\\
258 - And who's Lynda Carter?\\
259 - Lynda Carter is an actress.\\
260 - Oh. And she makes you say her whole name?\\
261 - She doesn't make you,\\
262 - it's just something you do when people reach icon status.\\
263 - So why won't you set Alan up with her?\\
264 - She's out of his league.\\
265 - What league is she in?\\
266 - Well, among others, the Justice League.\\
267 - All right, I have no idea what you're talking about,\\
268 - so let me just ask you a question.\\
269 - Is Alan good enough to be your friend?Of course.\\
270 - So then why isn't he good enough for her?Okay, that's not fair.\\
271 - There are a lot of women that Alan is not good enough for.\\
272 - Don't you think she should decide who she can go out with?\\
273 - Hmm. That's actually a good point.\\
274 - Hang on, one second, is this Lynda Carter?Uh-huh.\\
275 - Yeah, Alan's not good enough for her.\\
276 - [sighs]\\
277 - Alan.\\
278 - ALAN: Yeah?\\
279 - Are you decent?\\
280 - Not by your standards.\\
281 - Okay, I'm coming in.\\
282 - What do you want?\\
283 - If it's self-esteem you're after, there's none here.\\
284 - I was wrong.\\
285 - It is not my place to decide who you can or cannot date.\\
286 - No, no, it's fine.\\
287 - Uh, actually, I'm making a list\\
288 - of the people you shouldn't date.\\
289 - Uh, Number one: Anyone with a heart.\\
290 - Okay, you know, I deserve that.\\
291 - And number two, Taylor Swift, because she will\\
292 - write a song about you called "Back-Stabbing Dream Killer."\\
293 - Okay, well, if you will let me,\\
294 - I would like to make it up to you.\\
295 - I invited my mother and Lynda over for dinner tomorrow night.\\
296 - So, you are free to ask her out yourself.\\
297 - If you're joking, I swear to God\\
298 - I will pack my things and you will never see me again.\\
299 - I was joking.So was I.\\
300 - You're not just doing this out of pity, are you?\\
301 - Don't answer, I don't care.\\
302 - You're a good friend.\\
303 - So are you.\\
304 - And, again, I'm sorry.\\
305 - Thank you.\\
306 - Okay. Oh, and, and, a little tip:\\
307 - when Lynda's here, just try not to act like a crazy fan.\\
308 - [chuckles] I got it.No, no, seriously, like, if, if you want a shot with her\\
309 - you need to treat her like she's a normal person.\\
310 - And, and you should pretend to be one, yourself.\\
311 - It's not a problem. [laughs]\\
312 - Until tomorrow.\\
313 - All right, I'm out of here.\\
314 - Dinner's in the oven and the wine's chilling.\\
315 - Oh, thank you.\\
316 - No, I was talking about at my house.\\
317 - Oh, oh, uh, uh, before you go, um,\\
318 - uh, uh, which is my good side?What?\\
319 - I'm trying to figure out where to sit at dinner.\\
320 - I-I want my good side facing Lynda.\\
321 - All right.\\
322 - Turn to your left.\\
323 - Okay.\\
324 - Now turn to your right.\\
325 - Okay.\\
326 - Turn around.\\
327 - Perfect.\\
328 - Who hurt you, Berta?\\
329 - [doorbell rings]\\
330 - Oh, uh...\\
331 - Ooh, uh, just in case.\\
332 - Oh, God, it burns!\\
333 - What did I say about acting like a normal person?\\
334 - That was before I got mint spray in Little Alan's eye.\\
335 - I'm not even gonna ask.\\
336 - Oh, hey, you two look beautiful.\\
337 - Oh, it's great to see you again, Walden.\\
338 - And don't forget about me. [chuckles]\\
339 - Oh, don't worry, I haven't.\\
340 - Okay, you can let go now.\\
341 - Well, I'm glad you two could make it.\\
342 - Wow, this is quite the place.\\
343 - BOTH: Thank you.\\
344 - Single guy living at the beach,\\
345 - you must do well with the ladies.\\
346 - I do okay, but this guy is the real charmer.\\
347 - Blink twice if you're being held against your will.\\
348 - Well, it's, it's true, in my youth\\
349 - I was a bit of a, a rapscallion.\\
350 - [nervous chuckle]\\
351 - A rake.\\
352 - A... gadabout.\\
353 - WALDEN: A... g-gadabout?\\
354 - What have you.\\
355 - Yeah, but that was in your past, right?\\
356 - And now you're just a normal, regular guy?\\
357 - Yeah, that's right, that's right.\\
358 - I'm just a, a normal, regular guy\\
359 - looking for a crazy little thing called love.\\
360 - LYNDA CARTER:     Crazy little thing called love...    \\
361 - What's that I hear?\\
362 - Is that the lovely voice of triple-threat Lynda Carter?\\
363 - Actress, singer, dancer?\\
364 - Wait a second, do I smell mint?\\
365 - Yes, and it's not coming from my mouth.\\
366 - Oh ,uh, uh, would you mind signing it\\
367 - "From a Wonder Woman to a Super Man"?\\
368 - How about "best wishes"?That works. [chuckles]\\
369 - Hey, you know, I'll, I'll bet you could\\
370 - make a lot of money traveling around\\
371 - and signing at conventions and stuff.\\
372 - I'm not a big fan of travel.\\
373 - Yeah, not to mention the weirdos you'd meet.\\
374 - Ugh. You don't have to tell me,\\
375 - I mean, I-I've talked to a lot of them\\
376 - on the Wonder Woman message boards. Freaks!\\
377 - Alan?Hmm?\\
378 - I'm pretty sure Lynda didn't come here just to sign things.\\
379 - Oh, of course, of course. Sorry, I just, you know,\\
380 - I, I geeked out a bit. [chuckles]\\
381 - Oh, that's okay. You can't imagine how often\\
382 - I get roped into these kinds of conversations.\\
383 - Roped? Or...\\
384 - ...lassoed?\\
385 - Oh, God. He's gonna tie her up and throw her in a van.\\
386 - No, no. This is an original Wonder Woman Lasso of Truth.\\
387 - I-I got it at Comic Con '88.\\
388 - Yeah, back when only the really cool people went.\\
389 - Whoever is wearing the lasso must tell the truth.\\
390 - [giggles] Is this the best night of my life?\\
391 - It is.\\

\subsection {Episode 07: Some Kind of Lesbian Zombie}
1 - [conversation, laughter]\\
2 - Thank you.\\
3 - Wow. She's cute.\\
4 - She sure is.\\
5 - She sucks in bed.\\
6 - And not in a good way.\\
7 - Her, too?\\
8 - I-I didn't even know she was gay.\\
9 - Neither did she, till last Thursday.\\
10 - You're like some kind of lesbian zombie\\
11 - infecting all the women of Malibu.\\
12 - Ha!\\
13 - I like that.\\
14 - [as zombie]: Must have vagina.\\
15 - [as zombie]: Must have vagina.\\
16 - Sounds like some kind of weird help wanted ad\\
17 - Alan would place.\\
18 - [chuckles]\\
19 - So when did you realize that you were gay?\\
20 - Oh, oh...\\
21 - What's that I hear?\\
22 - Is that your own closet door finally swinging open?\\
23 - Trust me, if I was gay\\
24 - you'd be the first one to know.\\
25 - You know, I think I was in high school\\
26 - when I figured it out.\\
27 - A bunch of my friends were having a sleepover\\
28 - and we started talking about\\
29 - what it would be like to kiss a boy\\
30 - and who was the best kisser.\\
31 - So me and my friend Kimberly,\\
32 - who was a cheerleader,\\
33 - decided to settle it by making out.\\
34 - A-a cheerleader?\\
35 - Let the woman talk.\\
36 - Kimberly was so hot.\\
37 - I still remember how soft her lips felt\\
38 - as she slipped her hand under my shirt\\
39 - and kissed her way down my body.\\
40 - Must've been a strange and confusing time for you.\\
41 - Please continue.\\
42 - She closed her eyes.\\
43 - She parted her lips.\\
44 - She arched her back\\
45 - and I whispered in her ear,\\
46 - "Oh, my God,\\
47 - "Kimberly,\\
48 - "I can't believe\\
49 - "these two idiots\\
50 - actually believe this story."\\
51 - And then what happe... Aw!\\
52 - Damn it!\\
53 - It's not that complicated.\\
54 - The first time you masturbate thinking about the school nurse\\
55 - you pretty much know.\\
56 - BOTH: Oh, my God, I'm a lesbian.\\
57 - We need to start hanging out with girls who aren't gay.\\
58 - Or related to us.\\
59 - How 'bout her?\\
60 - Oh, I suppose I could go talk to her.\\
61 - I think Jenny was talking about me.\\
62 - Oh, really?\\
63 - And you assume that just because you're rich and good-looking?\\
64 - No, I was going to say smart and charming,\\
65 - but if you mix all those ingredients together,\\
66 - you make one delicious hot guy pie.\\
67 - Well, your "hot guy pie" is no match for my system.\\
68 - No, hold on.\\
69 - Going on Craigslist and looking up "escorts"\\
70 - isn't a system.\\
71 - That is not my system,\\
72 - that is my backup plan.\\
73 - My system consists of the three "C"s:\\
74 - connect, charm and cry.\\
75 - Works every time.\\
76 - Uh, okay...\\
77 - "Hi, my name's Alan.\\
78 - "That is a beautiful blouse you're wearing.\\
79 - My dead wife was buried in one just like it."\\
80 - Yeah, my system's a lot simpler.\\
81 - I wait for you to finish talking\\
82 - and then I take them home.\\
83 - Oh, oh, big words coming from somebody\\
84 - sitting alone next to me. Oh.\\
85 - Okay, fine. Well, let's just go see who she likes better.\\
86 - Oh, my God.\\
87 - No one is safe.\\
88 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
89 -     Ah.         Men.         Men.    \\
90 - [indistinct conversations]\\
91 - Hey, do you think all women are potentially lesbians?\\
92 - Um, I have 30 years\\
93 - of masturbating to porn that say yes.\\
94 - You know, you brag more\\
95 - about your masturbating prowess\\
96 - than any person I know.\\
97 - It ain't bragging if it's true.\\
98 - Ooh. Alpha bravo, two bogeys on your six.\\
99 - Why are you talking like that?\\
100 - Oh, my... Did you have a stroke?\\
101 - It's airplane talk.\\
102 - I'm your wingman.\\
103 - It... it just means two cute girls just walked in.\\
104 - Why didn't you just say two cute girls just walked in?\\
105 - Roger that.\\
106 - Will you stop that?Over and out.\\
107 - Wow. Yeah.\\
108 - They are cute. Yeah, yeah.\\
109 - So, uh... so what's the play here?\\
110 - Um, uh... how about something like, uh...\\
111 - "Hey, uh, those seats are taken,\\
112 - but our faces aren't"?\\
113 - How about, "I'm Walden,\\
114 - and this is my mute friend Alan"?\\
115 - Fine.\\
116 - You think you've got such great game, lead the way,\\
117 - Mr. "I'm too good for Craigslist and masturbating."\\
118 - Hi.\\
119 - Hi.\\
120 - That's all I got.\\
121 - Uh, ladies, uh, uh, how much does a polar bear weigh?\\
122 - Oh, I don't know.\\
123 - Enough to break the ice. I'm Dr. Alan Harper.\\
124 - Uh, this is my associate Walden Schmidt.\\
125 - Google him, he's rich.\\
126 - If you Google me, you can see my boobs.\\
127 - Also if you do this.\\
128 - Hi.\\
129 - Oh, oh, uh, take another look,\\
130 - but this time spell "attic."\\
131 - A-T-T-I-C.\\
132 - Oh! I get it.\\
133 - Because these are my tee-tees\\
134 - and I see them.\\
135 - I'm sorry about my friend. I'm sorry about my friend.\\
136 - Walden. Jill.\\
137 - So, Alan, what kind of doctor are you?\\
138 - Oh, I'm a...\\
139 - a chiropractor...\\
140 - slash brain surgeon.\\
141 - Oh!\\
142 - So, uh, w-what do you guys do?\\
143 - We're princesses at a theme park.\\
144 - Really?\\
145 - Yeah, I play Cinderella\\
146 - and she's the Little Mermaid.\\
147 - Oh, well, that certainly makes sense\\
148 - because, uh, you "swept"\\
149 - my friend off his feet\\
150 - and-and I'm "hooked" on you.\\
151 - Oh, my God, that's funny\\
152 - because I'm a fish.\\
153 - [laughing] Yes.\\
154 - The answer to the question you're not asking is:\\
155 - because she makes me look smart.\\
156 - Well, the answer to the question you're not asking is:\\
157 - because he won't move out.\\
158 - Morning.Oh, hey.\\
159 - How great was last night?\\
160 - It was pretty good.\\
161 - Those girls didn't know what hit 'em.\\
162 - What'd you use, chloroform or Tasers?\\
163 - I will have you know\\
164 - that Walden and I have dates tonight\\
165 - with two theme park princesses.\\
166 - Mine's Cinderella.\\
167 - Perfect for you.\\
168 - Storybook beauty.\\
169 - And mine is the Little Mermaid.\\
170 - Perfect for you.\\
171 - No legs to run away.\\
172 - I'm telling you, if we play our cards right,\\
173 - we're gonna get ourselves some fairy-tail.\\
174 - "Fairy-tail"?\\
175 - Because, you know, "tail" has two meanings.\\
176 - Yeah, so does "fairy."\\
177 - Hey, guys.\\
178 - ALAN: Hi. Hey.\\
179 - This is Maria.\\
180 - Maria, this is Walden and Alan.\\
181 - Oh, that's so cool.\\
182 - You didn't tell me your parents were gay.\\
183 - Didn't I?\\
184 - Dad and Mom.\\
185 - Hi. It's nice to meet you.\\
186 - Uh, listen, I gotta go.\\
187 - But you are going to call me, right?\\
188 - Absolutely. You sure?\\
189 - Yes.\\
190 - I would not lie to you in front of my parents.\\
191 - Bye, it was nice meeting you.\\
192 - Don't be a stranger, dear.\\
193 - That's not the girl you picked up in the bar last night.\\
194 - No, she delivered the pizza\\
195 - to me and the girl I picked up at the bar last night.\\
196 - Well, I hope you gave her a good tip.\\
197 - Nah, she didn't come in 30 minutes or less.\\
198 - Whoa.\\
199 - [imitates siren]\\
200 - Fashion Police.\\
201 - Pull over.\\
202 - What?\\
203 - The reason I stopped you\\
204 - is it appears your style has expired.\\
205 - You don't like this sweater?\\
206 - I thought it looked good.\\
207 - Have you been drinking, sir?\\
208 - This coming from a man\\
209 - who looks like he's been tented for termites.\\
210 - [doorbell rings]\\
211 - Lyndsey.\\
212 - Hi, Alan.\\
213 - Uh, did we have plans for tonight?\\
214 - No, I was in the area\\
215 - and I thought I'd surprise you with a booty call.\\
216 - Oh. Wow.\\
217 - Well, normally that would be delightful, but...Wait.\\
218 - You're wearing cologne and your one good shirt.\\
219 - You have a date.\\
220 - Oh, no, I-I wouldn't call it a date,\\
221 - you know, uh, um...\\
222 - Walden met this woman,\\
223 - and she's got a friend, really ugly.\\
224 - Mm-hmm. [chuckling]\\
225 - You know how they say, you know,\\
226 - people were beaten with the ugly stick?\\
227 - Well... well, you know,\\
228 - if you took a bunch of the ugly sticks\\
229 - and built an ugly house,\\
230 - when this girl walked by,\\
231 - the house would call her ugly.\\
232 - Alan, relax.\\
233 - You're allowed to date.Oh, really?\\
234 - Of course. I mean, I have a boyfriend.\\
235 - Oh, thank God, 'cause this girl is actually way hot.\\
236 - [laughs]\\
237 - I mean, you know, not as hot as you,\\
238 - but, you know, young-hot.\\
239 - You've been hot a lot longer.\\
240 - I'm gonna go.\\
241 - You sure you're okay with this?\\
242 - I'm sure.\\
243 - Go have fun.\\
244 - Oh, that's my good old Lyndsey.\\
245 - I didn't mean "old"!\\
246 - [imitates siren]\\
247 - Idiot Police.\\
248 - Pull over.\\
249 - God, it's great out here.\\
250 - The stars look amazing.\\
251 - Yeah, without the lights from the city, they really pop.\\
252 - That's why you can see Orion's Belt so clearly.\\
253 - Uh, you know, if you look under Orion's Belt,\\
254 - uh, you can see his Little Dipper.\\
255 - [laughs]\\
256 - Oh, my God, you are so bad.\\
257 - [laughing]\\
258 - You're into astronomy?\\
259 - 'Cause I've been into astronomy\\
260 - since I went to space camp.\\
261 - Also about the same time I got into\\
262 - getting my ass kicked at school.\\
263 - I always wanted to go to space camp.\\
264 - Nerd!\\
265 - I prefer "geek."\\
266 - Wh-What about you, Laurie?\\
267 - Are you into astronomy?\\
268 - Yep, I'm a Virgo.\\
269 - But I'm not a virgin.\\
270 - Both good signs for me.\\
271 - So, uh, how did you become a princess, anyway?\\
272 - Oh, I get that a lot.\\
273 - [whispering]: I'm not a real princess.\\
274 - I'm also not a real redhead.\\
275 - You'll find that out later.\\
276 - No way, it must be great being a princess.\\
277 - Yeah, for the most part.\\
278 - What's not so great are the pervy dads\\
279 - who are trying to cop a feel.\\
280 - The other day I was like,\\
281 - "Do that again, you're gonna find out\\
282 - where else my glass slipper fits."\\
283 - Is it weird that that turns me on?\\
284 - Is it weird that's why I told you?\\
285 - So, hey, would you girls like a little more champagne?\\
286 - Oh, I would![laughs]\\
287 - I love champagne.\\
288 - And puppies!\\
289 - Um, what's the magic word?\\
290 - Oh... boobs!\\
291 - Ah, the kids must love you.\\
292 - I really like Jill.\\
293 - I mean, she's fun, she's beautiful, she's smart.\\
294 - And I really like Laurie-- she's fun,\\
295 - she's beautiful, she's stupid.\\
296 - So, uh, what's the next move?\\
297 - I'm gonna take Jill up to my room and show her my telescope.\\
298 - What am I gonna do? There's nothing\\
299 - in my room to show Laurie.\\
300 - Yes, there is.\\
301 - You have a couch that turns into a bed.\\
302 - She'll be amazed.\\
303 - Okay, open your eyes.\\
304 - Oh, my God!\\
305 - Where'd the couch go?\\
306 - Ah-ah-ah!\\
307 - A magician never reveals his secrets.\\
308 - That's amazing.\\
309 - And for my next trick,\\
310 - I'm going to make my penis disappear.\\
311 - [gasps]\\
312 - I'll need a volunteer from the audience.\\
313 - Ooh, pick me, pick me!\\
314 - Um...\\
315 - [laughs]\\
316 - [cell phone ringing]\\
317 - [grunts]\\
318 - Oh, sorry, um...\\
319 - Uh, my mom.\\
320 - No problem.\\
321 - I'll go put in a condom.\\
322 - Uh, uh, that's not how...\\
323 - You know what? Great.\\
324 - Lyndsey?\\
325 - Alan? Thanks for calling.\\
326 - You called me.\\
327 - Oh, that's good 'cause I was\\
328 - just gonna call you.\\
329 - Lyndsey, you're drunk.\\
330 - Alan, you're boring.\\
331 - Okay, I'm gonna go.\\
332 - Whoa, whoa, wait!\\
333 - Just one thing.\\
334 - Remember when I told you I was okay\\
335 - with you dating other people?\\
336 - Uh-huh.\\
337 - Well, I'm not.\\
338 - You're not?\\
339 - [door opens]\\
340 - I'm ready for your next trick.\\
341 - Can I call you back? I'm...\\
342 - going into a tunnel.\\
343 - So, what do you think of your princess?\\
344 - I think I am enchanted.\\
345 - And engorged.\\
346 - Well, let's see about giving this story\\
347 - a happy ending.\\
348 - Uh, can you hold on for a second?\\
349 - Oh.Oh, oh!\\
350 - Uh, not what I meant.\\
351 - But... big thumbs-up.\\
352 - Oh, oh!\\
353 - It was a...\\
354 - It was a metaphorical thumbs-up.\\
355 - Uh, and-and you work with children.\\
356 - Is everything all right?\\
357 - Uh, yeah, yeah, uh, uh, can you just, uh,\\
358 - hang on a minute? I've got to freshen up.\\
359 - Oh, the bathroom's right there.\\
360 - Yeah, no, I have to...\\
361 - poop.\\
362 - Okay.\\
363 - Check out this star.\\
364 - Is that the guy from Survivor?\\
365 - Yeah, Jeff Probst.\\
366 - He's naked and cooking...\\
367 - bacon?\\
368 - Yeah, he does it every night.\\
369 - It's a regular bacon and sausage fest.\\
370 - And why do you watch?\\
371 - Uh, there's not much on TV.\\
372 - But... more importantly...\\
373 - I think he wants me to.\\
374 - Well, maybe if there was something better\\
375 - for you to look at?\\
376 - Oh.\\
377 - [loud knocking]\\
378 - ALAN: Walden! Walden!\\
379 - I know! Probst is cooking.\\
380 - ALAN: No, no! It-it's an emergency.\\
381 - I'm sorry, it's...Mm-hmm.\\
382 - What?\\
383 - Lyndsey called me.\\
384 - Oh, my God.Yeah.\\
385 - Why didn't you say that from the beginning?\\
386 - [loud knocking]\\
387 - She told me she is not okay with me dating someone else.\\
388 - She has a boyfriend, okay?\\
389 - What she's doing to you is not fair.So what should I do?\\
390 - You should do what every boy in America has dreamed about doing,\\
391 - and go downstairs and bang the Little Mermaid.\\
392 - You're right.\\
393 - A bush in the hand and all that.\\
394 - Well, I'd tell you to go screw her brains out,\\
395 - but somebody already beat you to it.\\
396 - [cell phone ringing]\\
397 - Aw, great.\\
398 - Um...\\
399 - Hi, Lynds.\\
400 - No, no, you have, uh, nothing to apologize for.\\
401 - I-I sent her home.\\
402 - You left a surprise for me?\\
403 - Oh...\\
404 - you didn't have to do that.\\
405 - Surprise!\\
406 - Lyndsey?Yeah.\\
407 - I felt bad about ruining your date\\
408 - so I wanted to make it up to you.Oh.\\
409 - LAURIE: Alan, where are you?\\
410 - Who was that?\\
411 - Oh, uh, that's just a TV show I'm watching.\\
412 - It's called...\\
413 - Alan, Where Are You?\\
414 - Um, well,\\
415 - you know what? Thanks for dropping by,\\
416 - but I'm gonna have to take a rain check.\\
417 - So I will see you soon.\\
418 - Are you done pooping?\\
419 - [groans]\\
420 - Whoop!\\
421 - Who the hell is this?\\
422 - Ooh, I'm so sorry.\\
423 - Is this your mom?\\
424 - Bitch, you are gonna die!\\
425 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.\\
426 - I thought you said you sent the slut home.\\
427 - How does she know I'm a slut?\\
428 - Okay, okay, this-this is just a classic misunderstanding.\\
429 - It-it's like a bad episode of Alan, Where Are You?\\
430 - You lied to me!\\
431 - I was just about to kick her out.\\
432 - You were about to kick me out?\\
433 - I wasn't. I was.\\
434 - I wasn't.\\
435 - WALDEN: Hey.\\
436 - What is going on?\\
437 - Alan's mom thinks I'm a slut.\\
438 - Alan's cheating on me.\\
439 - Uh, you have a boyfriend!\\
440 - Now who's the slut?\\
441 - Ooh, ooh!\\
442 - Okay, maybe...\\
443 - we should just get our things and go.\\
444 - No, no, no, no, no, no!\\
445 - Don't-don't get your things.\\
446 - I like your things.\\
447 - I haven't even seen your things.\\
448 - I really think we should call it a night.\\
449 - No, Alan, do something!\\
450 - Uh, o-okay, what we're gonna do is...\\
451 - [retching]\\
452 - Whoa!\\
453 - Whoa.\\
454 - Must have vagina!\\
455 - Morning.\\
456 - Hey, sorry for puking in the living room last night.\\
457 - What?\\
458 - I think I just drank\\
459 - a little too much.\\
460 - Oh, th-that wasn't you. That was Lyndsey.\\
461 - Oh, awesome!\\
462 - Guess who doesn't have a drinking problem.\\
463 - Morning. Morning.\\
464 - Sorry again about last night.\\
465 - You know what? I really liked Jill.\\
466 - What happened was out of my control.\\
467 - No, it wasn't!\\
468 - This whole non-relationship relationship thing\\
469 - you have going on with Lyndsey is ridiculous.\\
470 - And now it's affecting me.\\
471 - You owe me a princess and an area rug.\\
472 - What happened?I'll tell you what happened. Nothing.\\
473 - The only person who got hot, drunk sex last night\\
474 - was Lyndsey's boyfriend.\\
475 - Actually...\\
476 - Okay, fine. Him and you.\\
477 - Well...Aw, damn it!\\
478 - [doorbell rings]\\
479 - Lyndsey, can we talk?\\
480 - Sure, I've been puking at 20-minute intervals.\\
481 - So... you got eight minutes.\\
482 - Look, a-about last night...\\
483 - I-I am really sorry.\\
484 - I-I was totally out of line.\\
485 - It's just... I started picturing you\\
486 - with some other girl and I got so jealous.\\
487 - I mean...\\
488 - isn't that crazy?\\
489 - It's you.\\
490 - Ouch, there was an iron fist\\
491 - in that velvet glove.\\
492 - Um, look.\\
493 - I want to be with you.\\
494 - And this whole thing with me,\\
495 - you and Larry just isn't working anymore.\\
496 - So what are you saying?\\
497 - I'm saying it's-it's either me or him.\\
498 - Well, it's not that simple.\\
499 - I can't just choose.\\
500 - I guess you already did.\\
501 - Good-bye, Lyndsey.\\
502 - Alan, wait.\\
503 - Yeah?\\
504 - I-I choose you.\\
505 - Really?\\
506 - Yeah.Oh!\\
507 - Oh, you make me so happy.You make me happy, too.\\
508 - So, you gonna break up with Larry?\\
509 - Yes. Aw, great.\\
510 - It feels so good to be back in your arms.\\
511 - Yeah...\\
512 - Hold on.\\
513 - [retching]\\
514 - Oh, hold my hair!\\
515 - Oh, it's just like old times.\\
516 - [yells]\\
517 -     Men.   \\
518 - Wow.\\
519 - Yeah, wow.\\
520 - That was, uh...\\
521 - Boring. Very.\\
522 - What was missing?\\
523 - Larry.Larry.\\
524 - Knowing we're not supposed to have sex made it way hotter.\\
525 - It really did.\\
526 - You think maybe Larry would take you back?\\
527 - I haven't told him yet.Smart.\\
528 - Hey.\\
529 - Now that we both know that Larry's still in the picture,\\
530 - maybe we should try again.\\
531 - Okay.\\
532 - I promise this time I won't fake my orgasm.\\
533 - Oh, then neither will I.\\
534 - Walden.\\
535 - Can you help me, miss?\\
536 - A beautiful woman fled my house last night and the only clue\\
537 - I have to her identity\\
538 - is this shoe she left behind.\\
539 - Oh, that's very sweet, but this isn't a good time.\\
540 - Why, is it...?\\
541 - Do I smell bacon?\\
542 - You should go.\\
543 - Everything okay, babe?\\
544 - JILL: I just need a second.\\
545 - All right.\\
546 - Bacon's ready.\\
547 - I'm sorry.\\
548 - Damn you, Probst.\\

\subsection {Episode 08: Mr Walden He Die I Clean Room}
1 - Morning.\\
2 - Morning.\\
3 - Ooh, Cap'n Crunch.\\
4 - That's the only man I put in my mouth.\\
5 - It puts my relationship with Orville Redenbacher\\
6 - in a whole different light.\\
7 - I'm partial to the U.P.S. guy.\\
8 - We're making food jokes here.\\
9 - The U.P.S. guy's not food.\\
10 - He is if you cover him with whipped cream.\\
11 - What can I say?\\
12 - There's just something about a man in brown shorts.\\
13 - Okay, I'm in big trouble.\\
14 - Speaking of a man with brown shorts.\\
15 - What's wrong?\\
16 - Well, I just got a call\\
17 - from Lyndsey's boyfriend Larry.\\
18 - And he wants to see me.\\
19 - Well, he wants to see Jeff Strongman.\\
20 - Who's Jeff Strongman?\\
21 - Oh, Jeff Strongman\\
22 - is Alan's alter ego he uses\\
23 - to meet Larry and fight crime.\\
24 - Wait, so, you use a fake name to sneak around with other men?\\
25 - Where do you guys meet? A Lady Gaga concert?\\
26 - It was a spin class if you must know.\\
27 - Now, what am I gonna do?\\
28 - I told you something like this was gonna happen.\\
29 - [mocking]: "I told you something like this was gonna happen."\\
30 - Look, I am serious-- he wouldn't tell me why he wanted to see me\\
31 - and he sounded pretty upset.\\
32 - Well, what kind of world are we living in\\
33 - where a guy is upset with another guy\\
34 - for banging his girlfriend?\\
35 - See, that's why I love being gay.\\
36 - A guy finds out I'm doing his girlfriend,\\
37 - I don't get an angry phone call.\\
38 - I get a dozen roses and a copy of the video.\\
39 - Too bad I can't convince Larry I'm gay.\\
40 - Come on, Zippy, you're making it too easy for us.\\
41 - Oh, hey!\\
42 - There he is.\\
43 - My main man with a winter tan.\\
44 - Jeff.\\
45 - Uh, I got you a coffee. Can I get you anything else?\\
46 - Uh, one-one of these muffins? They're bran.\\
47 - Keeps your trains running on time.\\
48 - Poop-poop!\\
49 - I'm not hungry.\\
50 - All right then, I'll just sit across from you.\\
51 - Right here...\\
52 - in front of all these witnesses.\\
53 - You know my girlfriend Lyndsey?\\
54 - Is it Lyndsey?\\
55 - I thought it was Linda.\\
56 - Glad you cleared that up before I saw her again...\\
57 - which I haven't, and why would I?\\
58 - She's been cheating on me.\\
59 - [hacking]\\
60 - Mmm, sorry.\\
61 - Just a little... [clears throat]\\
62 - Why do you think she's cheating on you?\\
63 - I hired a private investigator to follow her.\\
64 - [hacking]\\
65 - Uh, do you mind?\\
66 - She's been meeting him at a house in Malibu.\\
67 - Sorry, sorry, I'm just a little shocked.\\
68 - Imagine how I feel.\\
69 - Well, I-I can't, uh, uh, but I do know\\
70 - that in situations like this, it's the woman who's to blame.\\
71 - She's not the only one.\\
72 - Please, I have a son!\\
73 - This is the guy.\\
74 - Wait, this is the guy?\\
75 - Yeah.\\
76 - This is guy you think banging your girlfriend?\\
77 - I know he is.\\
78 - And only him?\\
79 - Nobody else?\\
80 - Isn't this bad enough?\\
81 - Well, sure.\\
82 - But, you know, there could also be another explanation.\\
83 - I mean, maybe she's just lost\\
84 - and she's asking this guy for directions.\\
85 - Right, "Excuse me, sir, can you help me find my G-spot?"\\
86 - It's not just this photo.\\
87 - It's the late night errands.\\
88 - Hiding her phone.\\
89 - Plus, we haven't had sex in forever!\\
90 - Wow, that's rough.\\
91 - I guess this guy, whoever he is,\\
92 - satisfies her every need.\\
93 - I want to kill him.\\
94 - I hate being lied to like this.\\
95 - I get it, you know.\\
96 - Sometimes you think you know a person, but you don't.\\
97 - Panini for Strongman.\\
98 - Jeff, that's you.\\
99 - What?\\
100 - Oh, oh, yeah, that's me.\\
101 - Jeff Strongman.\\
102 - Someone who's not banging anyone's girlfriend.\\
103 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
104 -     Ah.         Men.         Men.    \\
105 - Oh, no, there's a stranger in my house.\\
106 - And it's possibly a gay porn star from the '70s.\\
107 - It's me, Alan.\\
108 - I-I believe you're supposed to say,\\
109 - [Italian accent]: "It's-a me, a-Mario!"\\
110 - So, I take it things didn't go great with Larry?\\
111 - Well, he does know that Lyndsey's cheating on him,\\
112 - but the good news is he doesn't know that it's with me.\\
113 - So, why do you look\\
114 - like one of the Village People in street clothes?\\
115 - Ah, well, uh, he hired a, uh, a private detective,\\
116 - uh, to watch the house because, uh,\\
117 - and here's where it gets really funny,\\
118 - um, uh,\\
119 - he thinks that Lyndsey is cheating on him with...\\
120 - No.\\
121 - No, no, no.\\
122 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!\\
123 - It's crazy, right?\\
124 - Why didn't you tell him the truth?\\
125 - Fear, cowardice.\\
126 - Lack of a dental plan.\\
127 - Uh, besides, he-he just lost Lyndsey,\\
128 - I didn't want him to lose his best friend.\\
129 - Okay, well, you're gonna lose your best friend\\
130 - if you don't fix this!\\
131 - Oh, I'm your best friend?\\
132 - Alan, I am serious.\\
133 - I do not want a private detective watching this house.\\
134 - And I... and I definitely don't want\\
135 - an angry boyfriend after me.\\
136 - Well, you should've thought of that\\
137 - before you slept with Lyndsey.\\
138 - I've got some work to do.\\
139 - And I'm gonna go out and run some errands.\\
140 - And when I get back, this better be cleaned up.\\
141 - Oh, oh, don't worry, I'm on it.\\
142 - Oh, oh, but just in case.\\
143 - Oh, God!\\
144 - Is there any look you can't pull off?\\
145 - [Italian accent]: I'm-a gonna kill you.\\
146 - Hey!\\
147 - Hi-ya!\\
148 - Oh!\\
149 - What the hell?\\
150 - Alan, what are you doing?\\
151 - At the moment, looking for my left ball.\\
152 - Larry just dropped me off.\\
153 - He could've seen you.\\
154 - That's why I'm here. Larry thinks you're\\
155 - having an affair with Walden.\\
156 - What? Why would he think that?\\
157 - Well, because he he hired a P.I.\\
158 - who got a picture of the two of you together.\\
159 - And by the way, it looked like it was a cold day.\\
160 - You're an idiot.\\
161 - I know.\\
162 - So, what-what are we gonna do?\\
163 - Okay, look, I've done this plenty of times before.\\
164 - The first thing you do is deny everything.\\
165 - Right, denial. Wait.\\
166 - You've done this plenty of times before?\\
167 - Did you ever cheat on me?\\
168 - Never.\\
169 - Okay, good.\\
170 - [phone chirps] Oh!\\
171 - Oh, it's Larry.\\
172 - What does he want?\\
173 - Uh, well, let's see.\\
174 - Uh, "Just dropped off the cheating whor...\\
175 - Lyndsey."\\
176 - "Want to grab a drink?"\\
177 - Okay, you go play\\
178 - the sympathetic friend, calm him down.\\
179 - I'll figure something out.\\
180 - Sounds good, uh...\\
181 - "No problem, bro."\\
182 - Uh...\\
183 - Cocktail glass emoji.\\
184 - Stall him as long as you can.\\
185 - Right.\\
186 - I'm sorry I kicked you\\
187 - in the balls-- is there anything I can do?\\
188 - You could kiss it and make it better.\\
189 - Good-bye, Alan.\\
190 - Oh, come on!\\
191 - It's not like I could do it myself.\\
192 - God knows I've tried.\\
193 - [tires screeching]\\
194 - Get in the car!Rose?\\
195 - What are you doing?\\
196 - Someone's following you.\\
197 - Yeah, you!\\
198 - There's no time for this, you're in danger.\\
199 - Yeah, from you!\\
200 - Just get in.\\
201 - Why would I get in your car?\\
202 - I mean, the last time\\
203 - I tried to trust you...\\
204 - What? What are you looking at?\\
205 - You got a little spot on your shirt.\\
206 - Oh.\\
207 - [screams]\\
208 - Drive! Drive! Drive!\\
209 - Drive! Drive!\\
210 - I found out more about this guy.\\
211 - His name is Walden Schmidt.\\
212 - More like lying sack of Schmidt.\\
213 - [chuckles] Am I right?\\
214 - Turns out he's some kind of stupid Internet billionaire.\\
215 - Don't you hate when guys don't work\\
216 - for a living like you and me?\\
217 - Amen, Jeff Strongman.\\
218 - Hey, come on, you know,\\
219 - this isn't the worst thing in the world.\\
220 - You're gonna bounce back.\\
221 - I guess, I mean, I should've seen it coming.\\
222 - I mean, she cheated on her last boyfriend with me.\\
223 - Her-her last boyfriend?\\
224 - Yeah, I guess the guy was a real loser.\\
225 - A pathetic freeloader.\\
226 - Well, that's just conjecture.\\
227 - I mean, you know, maybe he's a-a really great guy\\
228 - and she's just a crazy lying bitch.\\
229 - I'm not gonna take it lying down\\
230 - like the pansy she was dating before me.\\
231 - Is "pansy" your word or hers?\\
232 - Hers.\\
233 - I'm going to the head.\\
234 - You get the check\\
235 - and we'll go pay this bastard a visit.\\
236 - Take your time.\\
237 - No rush.\\
238 - Oh, come on, Lyndsey, pick up, pick up, pick up!\\
239 - [groans] Of course, voice mail.\\
240 - Lyndsey, things have gone from bad to worse.\\
241 - Larry is gonna confront Walden, and I don't know what to do.\\
242 - Call me back.\\
243 - Oh, and PS-- you and I have\\
244 - a little issue to discuss ourselves.\\
245 - Oh, and PPS-- the "P" stands for "pansy."\\
246 - Mm-hmm.\\
247 - Whew.\\
248 - Looks like we lost him.\\
249 - What the hell is going on?\\
250 - Well, I'm pretty sure Larry hired a hit man.\\
251 - How do you know about Larry?\\
252 - Because he's stalking you.\\
253 - How do you know that?\\
254 - Because I'm stalking you.\\
255 - Okay, okay, you know, this is ridiculous.\\
256 - I'm calling the police.\\
257 - And tell them what?\\
258 - We have no proof of anything.\\
259 - And besides, how helpful were the police\\
260 - when you called them on me?\\
261 - Uh, I got them to issue a restraining order.\\
262 - Hi.\\
263 - Okay, I...\\
264 - Uh-oh, he's back.\\
265 - I don't know how he keeps finding us.\\
266 - I'll tell you how.\\
267 - The GPS on my cell phone.\\
268 - Give me that.\\
269 - I was gonna turn it off, but okay.\\
270 - Hang on.\\
271 - What? Why?\\
272 - Whoa, whoa, whoa![squealing]\\
273 - Whoa!\\
274 - [sighs]\\
275 - That ought to do it.\\
276 - Okay, you know... this is nonsense!\\
277 - [stammers] Take me home.\\
278 - Okay, homeward bound.\\
279 - And gagged.\\
280 - And tortured for days.\\
281 - Okay, well, fine, then take me to a hotel.\\
282 - Beverly Hills Hotel okay?\\
283 - It's perfect.\\
284 - And bang, you're dead.\\
285 - You need to get off the grid.\\
286 - Someplace they don't expect you.\\
287 - A place they can't track your credit cards.\\
288 - Nobody is tracking my credit cards.\\
289 - Oh, that wasn't you last night getting a coffee colonic?\\
290 - I will not apologize for a healthy colon.\\
291 - Okay, here we go.\\
292 - This place looks perfect.\\
293 - This place is a dump.\\
294 - Exactly, and it's the last place anyone would look for you.\\
295 - Yeah, but it's the first place\\
296 - that hepatitis would look for me.\\
297 - Okay, this is only temporary.\\
298 - You lay low, and I will straighten this out.\\
299 - Why in God's name would I trust you?\\
300 - Look, Walden, I know that I've caused you\\
301 - some tiny problems in the past, but...\\
302 - Wha...? Tiny?\\
303 - You pretended to be pregnant\\
304 - to scare my girlfriend away.\\
305 - You sicced rabid ferrets on me!\\
306 - You tied me to my bed and tried to violate me\\
307 - with a leaf blower!\\
308 - It's so sweet you remember everything.\\
309 - But I can make up for all of that now.\\
310 - Look, when your sink is clogged, you call a plumber.\\
311 - When your car breaks down, you call a mechanic.\\
312 - When you have a dangerous psychopath after you,\\
313 - you call me.\\
314 - All right, fine.\\
315 - I am gonna kill Alan.\\
316 - Oh, if you survive tonight, you should hire Larry's guy.\\
317 - He's good.\\
318 -     Men.   \\
319 -     Men.   \\
320 - Here you go.\\
321 - This is, uh, this is the best room you got?\\
322 - It's the presidential suite.\\
323 - The president of what?\\
324 - Crap-o-slovakia?\\
325 - I could offer you the honeymoon suite.\\
326 - You know, if you don't mind the smell of love.\\
327 - No, no... this is, uh...\\
328 - this is fine.\\
329 - Uh...\\
330 - Do you, uh, do you have room service?\\
331 - I might have something you might want to eat.\\
332 - I don't think you do.\\
333 - Listen, uh, if-if anyone comes here asking about me,\\
334 - I-I'm not here.\\
335 - Don't worry.\\
336 - No one will ever find you.\\
337 - Hey, uh, if you get lonely later on,\\
338 - I'm in the apartment behind the building.\\
339 - Yeah, okay.\\
340 - It's nothing fancy, but I've got some good weed\\
341 - and... a spa tub.\\
342 - I'll, uh, keep that in mind.\\
343 - There's a live feed on channel 14\\
344 - if you want to check it out.\\
345 - [door closes]\\
346 - Great, now I got to hide from him, too.\\
347 - This Walden guy is gonna regret the day he stole my girlfriend.\\
348 - Oh, it's-it's not stealing. It-It's more like borrowing.\\
349 - Like-like renting a car.\\
350 - Yeah, but when you rent a car you know there's been\\
351 - other guys inside it, turning the knobs,\\
352 - playing with the seat,\\
353 - shoving stuff in the trunk.\\
354 - Okay, okay, maybe that's a bad analogy.\\
355 - But that doesn't change the fact that going over there\\
356 - to confront him is not gonna help anything.\\
357 - You got a better idea?\\
358 - Uh, I-I do.\\
359 - How about you forget about Lyndsey\\
360 - and we go out to a bar and pick up some women.\\
361 - You know, Larry and Jeff out on the prowl.\\
362 - [growls]\\
363 - Jeff, I appreciate what you're trying to do.\\
364 - But I'm afraid if I don't do this,\\
365 - I won't be able to live with myself.\\
366 - And I'm afraid if you do this,\\
367 - I'll have to live by myself.\\
368 - [indistinct chatter on TV]\\
369 - Oh, no! Channel 14!\\
370 - Oh, God!\\
371 - [knocking]\\
372 - Who is it?\\
373 - [deep voice]: It's Larry, I'm here to kill you, Walden.\\
374 - Mr. Walden, he die.\\
375 - I clean room.\\
376 - ROSE: No, silly rabbit, it's just me.\\
377 - Wha...? Rose?\\
378 - Is that...?\\
379 - Are you alone?\\
380 - Yeah, but a nice man did just invite me into his spa tub.\\
381 - Here, I brought some food.\\
382 - Yeah, I can't eat.\\
383 - Why not?\\
384 - Well, because if I do,\\
385 - eventually I'll have to go in there.\\
386 - And I'm not going in there.\\
387 - Uh, so, did you find anything out?\\
388 - Still no sign of Larry. He could be anywhere.\\
389 - God, Alan was supposed to take care of this.\\
390 - Well, yeah, he also told you he was only gonna live\\
391 - at your house a few days, and here we are at day 800 and...\\
392 - 43.\\
393 - Oh, I almost forgot.\\
394 - I got us some candy bars.\\
395 - Mounds for you, 'cause it's your favorite.\\
396 - Aw.\\
397 - Almond Joy for me\\
398 - 'cause, you know... nuts.\\
399 - Hey, why are you being so nice to me?\\
400 - You know, I'll admit that you hurt me.\\
401 - And I did some things that I'm not proud of.\\
402 - But just because you took a restraining order\\
403 - out against me...\\
404 - doesn't mean that I can restrain my feelings for you.\\
405 - That is the sweetest,\\
406 - most terrifying thing\\
407 - I've ever heard.\\
408 - Are you really scared of me?\\
409 - You're not even the scariest person I've met in this room.\\
410 - And the truth is, I'm-I'm not blameless.\\
411 - I mean, I chose another girl over you,\\
412 - and look who's here with me now?\\
413 - I never really left you.\\
414 - Literally.\\
415 - File this under things I'm gonna regret.\\
416 - Damn it, should've brought my leaf blower.\\
417 - Oh, uh, the doorbell doesn't work.\\
418 - What?\\
419 - I mean, uh, that-that does not work\\
420 - if you want to send a message that there's a man here.\\
421 -     Ding-dong.    \\
422 - "I'm gonna kick your tushie."\\
423 - You're right. Yeah.\\
424 - Oh.\\
425 - Okay, now, listen, now-now, this could get crazy.\\
426 - I mean, there's gonna be a lot of name calling--\\
427 - uh, uh, jerk, uh, idiot, uh, Alan.\\
428 - Uh...\\
429 - Larry? Lyndsey?\\
430 - I know exactly what's going on between you and Walden Schmidt.\\
431 - Now, where is he?\\
432 - Wow! This house is amazing.\\
433 - Larry, this isn't what you think.\\
434 - It's exactly what I think.\\
435 - I have pictures.\\
436 - We're standing in his house!\\
437 - Okay, it-it's time for me to tell you the truth.\\
438 - Don't believe her! She's a cheating, drunk whore!\\
439 - Larry, listen to me.\\
440 - I'm not here to sleep with Walden Schmidt.\\
441 - I'm here to sleep with someone else.\\
442 - What?! What?!\\
443 - Remember you told me\\
444 - your fantasy was to see me with another woman?\\
445 - Yeah? Yeah?\\
446 - I've arranged for your dream to come true.\\
447 - You did?! You did?!\\
448 - Yes, that's why I rented this beautiful beach house\\
449 - from Walden Schmidt as a birthday surprise.\\
450 - I also got us something else.\\
451 - So, which one is watching us?\\
452 - If it's him, I'm gonna have to charge extra.\\
453 - Wait a minute. Is this for real?\\
454 - Happy birthday, baby.\\
455 - Wow. Wow.\\
456 - [laughs] A threesome.\\
457 - That is quite a gift.\\
458 - Well, it was last minute,\\
459 - and I had to think of something.\\
460 - A nice cardigan wouldn't have done the trick?\\
461 - God, I feel so stupid.\\
462 - I even hired someone to follow you.\\
463 - Well, why don't you call them off,\\
464 - and we'll all go sit down\\
465 - and talk about the things you want to see?\\
466 - Bye, Jeff.\\
467 - Yeah, bye, Jeff.\\
468 - I'll send you a copy of the video.\\
469 - Wait. Thi-Thi... Wait. This is\\
470 - really... happening?\\
471 - I mean, you-you-you and-and-and her?\\
472 - And-and... and him?\\
473 - And-and-and here?\\
474 - While... while I...?\\
475 - Son of a bitch!\\
476 - [mutters]\\
477 - This is crazy.\\
478 - You know, I'll... I'll bet\\
479 - if Lyndsey had been sleeping with somebody else,\\
480 - he'd be really, really mad.\\
481 - I know. Isn't this great, Jeff?\\
482 - She's not a cheating whore. She's just a whore.\\
483 - Hi. It's Larry Martin.\\
484 - Oh, hey.\\
485 - Listen, I'm not going to be needing your services anymore,\\
486 - but I appreciate all your help.\\
487 - No problem.\\
488 - It was my pleasure.\\
489 - Good-bye.\\
490 - That was Alan.\\
491 - What did he say?\\
492 - Well, he, uh, thanked me for protecting you.\\
493 - But there's still no sign of Larry.\\
494 - And as long as he's out there, you're not safe.\\
495 - I'm gonna go get us some supplies.\\
496 - No, don't go!\\
497 - We're having a good time.\\
498 - You're just a sticky little honey bun, aren't you?\\
499 - Now, don't try to get in touch with anyone,\\
500 - or Larry will kill you.\\
501 - Kisses.\\
502 - [sighs]\\
503 - I got to go to the bathroom.\\
504 - Screw it. I'll just pee the bed.\\
505 - [thunder rumbling]\\
506 - [heavy footsteps]\\
507 - Rose?\\
508 - [loud jangling of keys]\\
509 - All right, come on, Rose.\\
510 - This... this... It's not funny.\\
511 - [thunder crackling]\\
512 - Larry?!\\
513 - Listen, we can... we can... we can work this out!\\
514 - It's-it's just a little misunderstanding.\\
515 - [door rattling]\\
516 - Oh, God! I...\\
517 - [door rattling loudly]\\
518 - Well, that was rude.\\
519 - Looks like I took a shower for nothing.\\
520 -     Men.   \\
521 -     Come out, come out, wherever you are!    \\
522 - I hate you, Jeff Strongman.\\

1 - I don't usually meet women as beautiful as you\\
2 - at a tech convention.\\
3 - Aw, that's very sweet.\\
4 - And you were definitely the hottest guy there.\\
5 - [chuckles] Thank you. Although, to be fair,\\
6 - being the hottest guy at a tech convention is kind of like...\\
7 - well, being the hottest guy at a tech convention.\\
8 - Although, once, I saw Justin Timberlake\\
9 - at a Microsoft party.\\
10 - Lady boner! [laughs]\\
11 - Yes, he did bring sexy back to Windows 8.\\
12 - So, you said you work for Google?\\
13 - That's right, in the modeling department.\\
14 - Oh, that's awesome. Like graphic rendering\\
15 - and 3-D imaging?\\
16 - More like pointing.\\
17 - "New from Google,\\
18 - confusing tech crap."\\
19 - Oh, so you're, like, a model-model?\\
20 - Yep. You can't spell Google without "ogle."\\
21 - Can you?\\
22 - No, you can't.\\
23 - But being a model at tech shows isn't what I really want to do.\\
24 - I just do it to pay the bills.\\
25 - Oh, I get it. What's your ultimate goal?\\
26 - I want to help teach people to read.\\
27 - Oh, that's noble. So, you want to be a teacher.\\
28 - No, I want to be the next Vanna White.\\
29 - [giggles]\\
30 - Oh, you're serious.\\
31 - Yeah. I mean, she has an amazing job,\\
32 - she wears amazing outfits and she has amazing hair.\\
33 - Somebody needs to buy a new, amazing adjective.\\
34 - You can't buy adjectives.\\
35 - You can only buy vowels.\\
36 - Right.\\
37 - Only vowels.\\
38 - Well, I owe you another drink.\\
39 - "O." "K."\\
40 - [under breath]: Certainly won't be any "I" in "U" tonight.\\
41 - Wow, that girl is gorgeous.\\
42 - Yeah, she's a model.\\
43 - We don't really have a connection.\\
44 - She's not very bright.\\
45 - I think she thinks Silicon Valley is the place\\
46 - where women go to get a boob job.\\
47 - Oh, you want intellectual stimulation.\\
48 - Uh, why don't you watch an episode of Nova\\
49 - while you're banging her brains out?\\
50 - No, I'm gonna go tell her it's not gonna work out.\\
51 - Well, if you don't want her, can I have her?\\
52 - Oh, sure, let's change shirts. Maybe she won't notice.\\
53 - Oh, she's thatdumb?\\
54 - Great.\\
55 - WOMAN: Walden!\\
56 - Look, a seagu... [screams]\\
57 - Oh, my God.\\

60 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
61 -     Ah.         Men.         Men.    \\
62 - Hey, what's going on?\\
63 - I was cleaning out my closet\\
64 - and I found a box of Jake's old stuff.\\
65 - Aw, that's sweet.\\
66 - Who's Jake?\\
67 - My son. Y-Your cousin.\\
68 - Oh, right.\\
69 - Oh, and how did he die?\\
70 - Oh, no, h-he's not dead. He's in the Army.\\
71 - Huh.\\
72 - Ah. Nice bong.\\
73 - Guess he's not fighting the war on drugs.\\
74 - No, that-that is a hummingbird feeder.\\
75 - He made it in art class.\\
76 - And in shop class, I made a train whistle.\\
77 - [imitates whistle]: Weed, weed!\\
78 - No, no, seriously.\\
79 - Uh, one summer, back in high school,\\
80 - he and his friends got into bird watching.\\
81 - They'd spend all day out in the woods, and they'd...\\
82 - they'd come back laughing and...\\
83 - Oh, God, I'm an idiot.\\
84 - Don't worry. All parents are idiots.\\
85 - My mom used to think I was locked in the bathroom all day\\
86 - with an electric toothbrush.\\
87 - [buzzes]\\
88 - My first wife was always using her electric tooth...\\
89 - God, I aman idiot.\\
90 - Oh, look at this. One of his old report cards.\\
91 - Oh, you can still see where he tried to change his grades.\\
92 - Yeah, he changed the C's.\\
93 - To D's.\\
94 - Yeah. That was the year his bus got a little shorter.\\
95 - But, you know, in his defense,\\
96 - his teacher changed that year, too.\\
97 - She went from C's to D's.\\
98 - Is this how you're spending your night?\\
99 - Oh, no, no. Later, I'm going to shave my back.\\
100 - Oh, actually, if you're not busy...\\
101 - I am. And so are you.\\
102 - I'm gonna get a drink. Where's Walden?\\
103 - Oh, he had to take his date to the hospital.\\
104 - Ooh, what are they pulling out, and from where?\\
105 - No, it-it's nothing like that.\\
106 - She was looking up at the sky and she fell off the deck.\\
107 - High?No.\\
108 - Drunk?No.\\
109 - Model?Yeah.\\
110 -     Men.   \\
111 - How you feeling?\\
112 - I'm all right.\\
113 - Uh, well, we need to fill out this paperwork.\\
114 - So, uh, first name, Nadine.\\
115 - This is awkward. I don't know your last name.\\
116 - It's H-O-R-E.\\
117 - H-O-R-E.\\
118 - Like "hooray"?\\
119 - No, like "whore."\\
120 - You think I should change it?\\
121 - No, be proud.\\
122 - I'm sure you come from a long line of... Hores.\\
123 - Uh, any relatives I can call?\\
124 - No, they're all back east.\\
125 - I'm the only Hore in Los Angeles.\\
126 - Agree to disagree.\\
127 - Emergency contacts. Okay, so no family.\\
128 - Uh, friends? Roommates?\\
129 - Anyone you've gone on more than one date with?\\
130 - Not really.\\
131 - I live alone.\\
132 - I've only been in L.A. a couple weeks.\\
133 - The only men in my life are you and Frank.\\
134 - Oh, all right. How do I get a hold of Frank?\\
135 - He's a pig.\\
136 - [chuckles] He's a pig, you're a Hore.\\
137 - No one's judging.\\
138 - No, he's my pet pig.\\
139 - My little frankfurter.\\
140 - A pig.\\
141 - Does he sleep in a blanket?\\
142 - Yeah, he totally hogs the covers.\\
143 - [laughs] Hogs. Good one.\\
144 - Never mind.\\
145 - Uh, what about medications?\\
146 - Love 'em.\\
147 - No, I-I think they mean "are you taking any now?"\\
148 - Oh, let's see, there's plaxitril for my depression,\\
149 - zaxaprin for my anxiety,\\
150 - dilapamin for my insomnia, and clodex\\
151 - for my occasional bouts of rage.\\
152 - No one likes an angry Hore.\\
153 - [indistinct conversations]\\
154 - [sighs] Why didn't you tell me we were going to a gay bar?\\
155 - 'Cause if I told you, you wouldn't have come.\\
156 - Yes, I would. I just would've dressed better.\\
157 - And just to be clear,\\
158 - you do know I'm not gay, right?\\
159 - I don't think you're gay.\\
160 - I-I mean, do I know guys that act less gay\\
161 - that have sex with other guys? Sure.\\
162 - But I know you're straight.\\
163 - So, why bring me here?\\
164 - Look around this room.\\
165 - See all the women here?Yeah.\\
166 - Well, some of them are gay. Those are mine.\\
167 - The rest are straight.\\
168 - Some of those are mine, too.\\
169 - And everyone who's left\\
170 - is gonna be drunk and horny by the end of the night\\
171 - and looking for someone who doesn't think vaginas are yucky.\\
172 - Oh, oh, you mean me.\\
173 - [high-pitched]: Yay.\\
174 - [deeper voice]: I mean, yay.\\
175 - Okay, be careful.\\
176 - Mm.Watch your leg.\\
177 - You smell so good.\\
178 - Thank you.\\
179 - Let's see how you taste.\\
180 - Okay. All right.\\
181 - I see the painkillers have kicked in.\\
182 - Oh, they sure did.\\
183 - Right now, you could do anything to me\\
184 - and I wouldn't remember.\\
185 - Did I wink? 'Cause I was trying to wink.\\
186 - Okay, let's-let's get you on the couch, huh?\\
187 - Hey, let's get you on Nadine.Oh, okay.\\
188 - All right, fine. Let's... just rest.\\
189 - Thank you so much for taking care of me.\\
190 - Well, you have a broken leg.\\
191 - You don't have any family or friends\\
192 - and you live on the fourth floor of a building with no elevator.\\
193 - So, I couldn't just leave you on the street.\\
194 - Could I?\\
195 - You're handsome.\\
196 - [grunts]Yeah.\\
197 - You're... drooling.\\
198 - I'm gonna get you some food.\\
199 - All right, but I have certain dietary constrictions.\\
200 - I don't eat wheat, dairy, or anything with a face.\\
201 - Although...\\
202 - I would make an exception for you.\\
203 - So, you're here with your niece?\\
204 - Uh, yeah, she just recently came out of the closet\\
205 - and she's painfully shy.Oh. Mm-hmm.\\
206 - Now, that's what I call breast-feeding.\\
207 - She's, uh, still trying to find her gay legs.\\
208 - Ah. Well, she's lucky she has an uncle who's found his.\\
209 - [sighs] No, I'm straight.\\
210 - Why does everybody think I'm gay?\\
211 - Oh, that is way too tart.\\
212 - Um, so, Paula,\\
213 - what do you do?\\
214 - I'm an investment banker.\\
215 - Oh, wow. Oh, okay, maybe you can answer a question\\
216 - I've always had.Mm-hmm?\\
217 - What's the penalty for early withdrawal?\\
218 - Well, uh, that depends.\\
219 - How big is your deposit?\\
220 - Oh, interest is rising.\\
221 - You know, the longer you keep it in,\\
222 - the bigger your reward.\\
223 - Sometimes, the market collapses\\
224 - and there's nothing you can do about it.\\
225 - Uh, wait. Are-are we doing sexual innuendo\\
226 - or are you asking for free financial advice?\\
227 - Why can't it be both?\\
228 - You know, if you're interested,\\
229 - I've got a Malibu beach house.\\
230 - Oh. Well, if you're interested, I've got very loose morals.\\
231 - [high-pitched]: Yay.\\
232 - [deeper]: I mean, yay.\\
233 - [chuckling]: Wow.\\
234 - That was amazing. [laughs]\\
235 - Uh-huh.\\
236 - Wait, it wasn't? 'Cause I can do better.\\
237 - No, you were great.\\
238 - Oh, thank God, 'cause I can't do better.\\
239 - Oh.\\
240 - But there is something I probably should've told you\\
241 - before we slept together.\\
242 - Oh, God, husband or herpes?Uh...\\
243 - Well, there was another guy. Paul.\\
244 - Paul. Paula. That must have been confusing.\\
245 - Very, yeah. Um...\\
246 - You see, for the first 40 years of my life,\\
247 - I was a man named Paul.\\
248 - Wow.\\
249 - You don't look... 40.\\
250 -     Men.   \\
251 - So, so, you were a guy? With, you know,\\
252 - an Adam's apple and facial hair,\\
253 - and the whole kit and kaboodle?\\
254 - Yep, I had a kit and two kaboodles.\\
255 - So, so, how did you get that?\\
256 - I mean, did you have to get a donor?\\
257 - 'Cause I've never seen that box\\
258 - to check on a driver's license.\\
259 - Actually, uh, I-I... I donated my own organ.\\
260 - You see, what they do, they take your penis, all right?\\
261 - They slice it right down the middle...Oh! La la la la la la la la la.\\
262 - Okay, I'll-I'll spare you the details\\
263 - on what happened to my balls.\\
264 - Well, I know what just happened to mine.\\
265 - Look, I-I know I should have told you earlier.\\
266 - I just didn't want to scare you away. I really like you.\\
267 - Oh, and I like you. I mean, we have a lot in common.\\
268 - Clearly more than I realized.\\
269 - Maybe it's best if I go.\\
270 - Oh, no, no, d-don't go.\\
271 - You sure?\\
272 - Yeah, yeah, no, I like you.\\
273 - I'm just, I'm trying to process this whole thing.\\
274 - I mean, for instance,\\
275 - there's no chance it'll grow back, right?\\
276 - What, like-like a salamander's tail?\\
277 - No. Uh-uh.\\
278 - So one day you're not gonna, you know, sneeze real hard\\
279 - and suddenly I'm dating a dude?\\
280 - Alan, I am as much a woman as you've ever dated.\\
281 - But if you're not okay with this, it's...No, no, no, you know what?\\
282 - I am not going to let one little thing come between us.\\
283 - Oh, it wasn't little.\\
284 - Okay, uh, Paula, bit of, uh, relationship advice?\\
285 - Uh, no guy likes to hear\\
286 - that his girlfriend had a bigger penis than he does.\\
287 - You're right.[chuckles]\\
288 - I'm sorry.\\
289 - [sneezes]\\
290 - Sorry.\\
291 - Gesundheit.\\
292 - Morning.Morning.\\
293 - Oh great, we're out of bacon.\\
294 - Whoa.\\
295 - We're out of naked Heidi Klum.\\
296 - Damn.\\
297 - That's Frank. He belongs to my date Nadine.\\
298 - Alan told me about her.\\
299 - That's the model you took to the emergency room.\\
300 - Twice. She calls it our "special place."\\
301 - It's the worst date of my life.\\
302 - Is her mouth broken?\\
303 - No.\\
304 - So what's the problem?\\
305 - The problem is, we have no connection.\\
306 - How can I be attracted to a woman's body\\
307 - if I'm not attracted to her mind?\\
308 - Sounds kind of gay, but all right.\\
309 - Hey, Walden.\\
310 - Jenny.\\
311 - Zippy.\\
312 - Just a heads-up, there's a girl asleep on the couch.\\
313 - Don't worry, I know the drill, boss.\\
314 - Give her 500 bucks, pat her down for silverware\\
315 - and throw her in a taxi.\\
316 - What?\\
317 - Sorry. Charlie flashback.\\
318 - Morning.\\
319 - [snorts]Whoa!\\
320 - That's a pig.\\
321 - Whoa! That's a leech.\\
322 - Long story, crazy night.\\
323 - [scoffs] Pig or no pig, not as crazy as mine.\\
324 - 100 bucks says mine beats yours.\\
325 - I had sex with a woman who used to be a man.\\
326 - And we have a winner.\\
327 - What, really?\\
328 - I can't believe that you would...\\
329 - Well, ah, then again, it's you.\\
330 - Hey, hey, say what you want,\\
331 - but she really knows her way around a man.\\
332 - It's like climbing Mount Everest with a really good Sherpa.\\
333 - Yeah, but you don't shtupthe Sherpa.\\
334 - How did it work? Like, where did it... go?\\
335 - Oh, that's easy. See, what they do is,\\
336 - they slice the penis down the middle...\\
337 - Oh. La la la la la.La la la la la.\\
338 - NADINE: Walden?\\
339 - Is there somewhere I can take a bath?\\
340 - Oh, yeah, upstairs. Here, I'll help you.\\
341 - No.\\
342 - I will never get out of here\\
343 - if I don't start to do things on my own.\\
344 - Unless you don't want me to leave.\\
345 - Top of the stairs, on the left.\\
346 - That girl is really messed up.\\
347 - The only thing wrong with mine\\
348 - is the occasional five o'clock shadow.\\
349 - You know, I've got to say, Alan, you going out\\
350 - with a post-op transgendered person without any judgment--\\
351 - very enlightened.\\
352 - Oh, thank you.\\
353 - And you should see her boobs.\\
354 - [cell phone chiming]\\
355 - You're getting a call from a "Hore?"\\
356 - Hi, Nadine.\\
357 - You got... you got it stuck where?\\
358 - Don't move, I'll be right there.\\
359 - Nadine got her boot caught in the banister.\\
360 - Excuse me.\\
361 - NADINE: Never mind, I got it.\\
362 - [loud thud]Oh no.\\
363 - 500 bucks in cab fare, and he'd be out of this.\\
364 - I can't believe how easily we agreed on a movie.\\
365 - I know, men and women aren't usually on the same page.\\
366 - Oh, oh, here it is.\\
367 - Uh, theater three, Julia Roberts in Hashtag: I Love You.\\
368 - Listen, I'm gonna get a soda. Do you want something?\\
369 - Oh, sure. Uh, oh, let me see what I'm in the mood for.\\
370 - Oh, uh, want to split a hot dog?Mmm.\\
371 - Oh, I am so sorry.\\
372 - It's fine.\\
373 - Hi. Uh, can we have two Diet Cokes\\
374 - and a hot dog, please?\\
375 - Oh, uh...Don't worry, I got it.\\
376 - Okay, but I'm used to paying.\\
377 - This is... this is so weird.\\
378 - Sorry, just, you know, old habits from when I was Paul.\\
379 - I-I hope you're okay with that.\\
380 - I think it's pretty clear that I'm willing\\
381 - to work around things in this relationship.\\
382 - Well, I appreciate it,\\
383 - because I'm having a great time with you.\\
384 - Oh, well, so am I.Mm-hmm?\\
385 - Uh, but going forward, you're gonna have to learn\\
386 - to embrace my masculinity and, you know, accept the fact\\
387 - that I'm the-- thank you-- man in this relationship.\\
388 - Oh, it's chilly in here.\\
389 - Oh, here. Take my jacket.\\
390 - Oh. Cozy.\\
391 - [slap, thud, knock]\\
392 - [slap, thud, knock]\\
393 - [slap, thud, knock]\\
394 - Who's there?\\
395 - It's just me, silly.\\
396 - Is everything all right?\\
397 - You've taken such good care of me,\\
398 - I thought it was time for me\\
399 - to take good care of you.\\
400 - Oh, that's not necessary.\\
401 - Why not?\\
402 - We could play doctor.\\
403 - Haven't you seen enough doctors?\\
404 - Okay, we could play Pat and Vanna.\\
405 - The clue is "things people do naked."\\
406 - Okay, Nadine, just stop.\\
407 - What's wrong?\\
408 - [sighs] We're not gonna sleep together.\\
409 - Are you saying\\
410 - that you don't want any of this?\\
411 - "N," and I'd like to buy five O's.\\
412 - Look, we-we just don't click.\\
413 - I can't believe you led me on. Ooh.\\
414 - Led you on? I let you in. I was trying to help you.\\
415 - Do I look like I need your help?\\
416 -     Men.   \\
417 - [phone rings]\\
418 - Yeah? No, I'm not doing anything.\\
419 - Seriously?I know, I know. I should say something.\\
420 - No, no, it's fine.\\
421 - I'll come over after the movie.[scoffs]\\
422 - He should go now.\\
423 - What's that?\\
424 - Shh!Shh!\\
425 - Just ignore him. People can only make you angry\\
426 - with your permission.\\
427 - Right. But if he opens his mouth again, I will get the usher.\\
428 - [chuckles] I got my review.\\
429 - Hashtag piece of crap.\\
430 - Shh!Shh!\\
431 - All right, you know what? That's it.\\
432 - Oh, wait, oh, no, no, no, Let me do this.\\
433 - Alan, Alan, you don't have to do this.Yes, I do. I'm the man\\
434 - and this is what a man does. Now, hold my Jujubes.\\
435 - Uh, excuse me, sir?\\
436 - What?Um, uh, we're all trying to watch the movie\\
437 - and I don't know if you remember what the, uh,\\
438 - the little cartoon popcorn bucket said,\\

14 - to sit on his lap and try to find the North Pole.\\
15 - BERTA: This came for you.\\
16 - I'm pretty sure it's from Jake.\\
17 - He spelled "Malibu" M-A-L-I-B-O-O.\\
18 - Oh. No,\\
19 - actually, it's "Maliboobs."\\
20 - He put little nipples on the O's.[laughs]\\
21 - I just can't get used to Christmas without him.\\
22 - It's just not the same.\\
23 - Remember how he used to screw up Christmas carols?\\
24 -     Shark named Harold    \\
25 - ALL:     Could not sing    \\
26 -     Let's all go to Burger King    \\

38 - Oh, man.\\
39 - Well, at least he tried.\\
40 - He packed 'em in ice.[coughs]\\

42 - ALAN: Mmm.And that poor, poor bunny.\\
43 - Looks like, uh, Jenny's Christmas present\\
44 - got here early.Mm-hmm.\\
45 - And from the sounds of it last night,\\
46 - it's a Scream My Name Elmo.JENNY: Hey,\\

49 - and this is Walden.\\

53 - Where did, uh, you two meet?\\
54 - At my work.\\
55 - Oh, and, uh, what do you do?\\
56 - I'm an esthetician.\\
57 - Ooh, an esthetician.Very impressive.\\
58 - You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?\\
59 - No. Zero.\\
60 - How do I put this?\\
61 - Do you guys like hairless vaginas?\\
62 - Aw, yeah. Yeah.\\
63 - Okay, there you go. That's what I do.\\
64 - You know, waxing, tweezing, threading and plucking.\\
65 - She plucked the hell out of me last night.\\
66 - Ooh, and brought a whole new meaning to "ho, ho, ho."\\
67 - Listen, you want to go get some breakfast?\\
68 - Nah, I got to bounce. Thanks again.\\
69 - See you.\\
70 - [door shuts]Did I just get blown off?\\
71 - Oh, yeah. Yeah. Big-time.\\
72 - Well, no biggie.\\
73 - I'll just go back to plucking myself.\\
74 - I feel bad for her.\\
75 - Do you remember the first time you were rejected by a woman?\\
76 - Yeah. When the maternity nurse handed me to my mom.\\
77 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
78 -     Ah.         Men.         Men.    \\
79 - [commentator speaking over TV]\\
80 - Care for some mulled cider, mull-lady?\\
81 - Oh... thanks,\\
82 - but I can't. I take hormones,\\
83 - and the acid in the cider makes my beard grow.\\
84 - [groans]\\
85 - God, you are so lucky.\\
86 - I wish I could grow a beard.\\
87 - Oh. Look what else I have,Hmm?\\
88 - a, uh, sprig of mistletoe.\\
89 - Okay, great. Game's in overtime.\\
90 - Mwah. Come on!\\
91 - [groans] I had the craziest day at the mall today.\\
92 - You heard me about the overtime, right?\\
93 - You heard me about the mall, right?\\
94 - Darn it. [groans]\\
95 - Is everything okay down there?\\
96 - Oh. [chuckles] My bad.\\
97 - I got phantom nuts.\\
98 - Hmm...\\
99 - You can scratch mine if you want.\\
100 - WOMAN: Hey, Paula,\\
101 - I'm just... Oh, sorry.\\
102 - I didn't realize you had company.\\
103 - No, no. Come on in. Uh...\\
104 - Rachel, this is Alan.\\
105 - Alan, this is my ex-wife.\\
106 - Oh. I, uh... I didn't know you were married.\\
107 - Uh, then again, I didn't know you had a penis, so...\\
108 - She lost them both at about the same time.\\
109 - Nice to meet you, Alan.\\
110 - Oh. You, too. It's really great that you guys are still friends.\\
111 - Yeah. And thankfully the same shoe size.Oh.\\
112 - By the way, those silver platforms that you lent me\\
113 - really did a number on my back.\\
114 - Oh, I'm sorry. But you're in luck.\\
115 - Alan here is one of the top chiropractors\\
116 - in Los Angeles.Well, I was named, uh,\\
117 - one of the "Top Chiropractors to Watch"\\
118 - by the Personal Injury Lawyer Trade Association.\\
119 - PAULA: Yeah, he's just\\
120 - being modest. Last night,\\
121 - he threw my back out. This morning, fixed it.\\
122 - Oh... [chuckles]\\
123 - Well, maybe I can come by your office.\\
124 - Oh, well, uh, I-I closed my office.\\
125 - Uh, I'm actually semi-retired.\\
126 - Uh, I-I do philanthropic work\\
127 - out in Malibu with a billionaire.\\
128 - We, uh... we run a sanctuary.\\
129 - What kind?\\
130 - Uh, you know, the homeless,\\
131 - unemployed middle-aged men, lesbian alcoholics, the usual.\\
132 - That's nice.Mm-hmm.\\
133 - Well, um, maybe you'd make a house call\\
134 - if that's not too weird?\\
135 - No weirder than me dating a dude. [chuckles]\\
136 - Oh. Somebody's been sneaking the cider. What?\\
137 - What? Really? Mmm. Mm-hmm.\\
138 - Hey.\\
139 - Hey.\\
140 - Looks like someone's celebrating the 12 steps of Christmas.\\
141 - Yeah, well, I've had a tough morning.\\
142 - You want to talk about it?\\
143 - Let's rap.\\
144 - "Rap"?\\
145 - You're like the creepy guidance counselor I had in high school.\\
146 - "Tell me all about your lesbian experiences.\\
147 - I can't help you unless I know every detail."\\
148 - God, I hated her.\\
149 - She was good in bed, though.\\
150 - Really? Tell me about it.\\
151 - I can't help you unless I know every detail.\\
152 - Oh, come on. You're a relationship guy, right?\\
153 - I don't know. I mean, I-I do believe\\
154 - there is someone out there for everyone.\\
155 - I'm just terrified that my someone is Alan.\\
156 - So... [clears throat] how do you know\\
157 - when you want to be in a relationship?\\
158 - The first sign is that you start asking people,\\
159 - "How do you know when you want to be in a relationship?"\\
160 - Oh, God.\\
161 - Sick of plucking yourself already?\\
162 - Is it the, uh, girl from yesterday?\\
163 - Yeah.\\
164 - Brooke.\\
165 - Why don't you just call her?\\
166 - No. No. I'm the girl that gets called.\\
167 - I don't do the calling.\\
168 - Oh, my God, she gave you a fake number.\\
169 - It's possible she lives in the back of a Mexican restaurant.\\
170 - Hey, look, if you really like this girl,\\
171 - look her up on Facebook and send her a message.\\
172 - Oh, or... send her a picture of your boobs.\\
173 - That's desperate.\\
174 - Besides, she already has a picture of my boobs.\\
175 - Or the busboy in the back of the Mexican restaurant has it.\\
176 - All right, look.\\
177 - Sometimes in life\\
178 - you have to take a risk\\
179 - and put yourself out there.\\
180 - Sometimes it doesn't work.\\
181 - But sometimes it does.\\
182 - And sometimes\\
183 - it works so well that you end up proposing to them\\
184 - and they say no\\
185 - and all you're left with is a custom designed ring\\
186 - that you can't return whose very existence mocks you.\\
187 - [exhales]\\
188 - You want to rap about it?\\
189 - Shut up!\\
190 - I will have this set up in a sec.\\
191 - [loud cracking]Oh! My back.\\
192 - Oh, my God, are you okay?\\
193 - [cracking][chuckles]\\
194 - Little chiropractor humor.\\
195 - I call it "cracking you up."\\
196 - Hop on up.\\
197 - How long have you and Paula been dating?\\
198 - Oh, just a-a couple of weeks.\\
199 - You know, still holding hands, running the water while I pee.\\
200 - How long were you and Paul together?\\
201 - 20 years.\\
202 - Wow. That's pooping while the other one showers.\\
203 - Uh, so, uh, Paul's change\\
204 - must have been a big adjustment for you.\\
205 - Oh, I was pretty angry at first.\\
206 - When he said he wanted to become a woman, I grabbed a knife\\
207 - from the kitchen and offered to do the surgery myself.\\
208 - Woop! [chuckles]\\
209 - Baggage just stowed for takeoff.\\
210 - Um, at least the two of you are in a healthy place now.\\
211 - Oh, it's not easy.\\
212 - Can you imagine how annoying it is\\
213 - that she's a better-looking woman than I am?\\
214 - And the boobs, by the way,\\
215 - exact copies of mine.\\
216 - Well, I think you're both very beautiful,\\
217 - and, uh... and kudos on the boobs.\\
218 - Would you mind working a little lower?\\
219 - Oh, sure. Let's, uh...\\
220 - let's narrow it down to the lumbar region.\\
221 - Uh, where does it hurt? Uh, L5? L4?\\
222 - Lower.\\
223 - Okay, we're into the-the sacral region.\\
224 - Uh, that's S2. S3?\\
225 - A-A little lower.\\
226 - Okay.\\
227 - Uh, I believe we are out of the S's\\
228 - and into the asses.\\
229 - How does that feel?\\
230 - Uh, like the tension has moved out of your back\\
231 - and into my pants.\\
232 - I'm sure this is wildly inappropriate,\\
233 - but I'm very attracted to you.\\
234 - Well, I'm-I'm flattered. Uh-uh, it's just that...\\
235 - I'm dating your ex-husband.\\
236 - Boy, that was a weird thing to hear yourself say.\\
237 - I understand.\\
238 - Let me know if you change your mind.\\
239 - You do realize your hand is still on my ass.\\
240 - I do.\\
241 - Still there.\\
242 - I'm just glad you don't know where my other hand is.\\
243 - Hi. So, I have you down for\\
244 - the total bro-zilian wax.\\
245 - Yeah, I wasn't really sure which one to choose.\\
246 - It was either that or the Butt Reynolds.\\
247 - Wait, don't I know you?\\
248 - Yeah, I'm Walden.\\
249 - Hang on. Did you chase me out of your house the other day\\
250 - for banging your wife? 'Cause she came on to me.\\
251 - No, uh, you hooked up with my friend Jenny.\\
252 - Uh, we live in Malibu.\\
253 - Oh, yeah, yeah, Jenny. Yeah, she was a lot of fun.\\
254 - Oh-oh, God, does she have herpes?\\
255 - Is that why you're here?\\
256 - [chuckles] No, that is not why I'm here.\\
257 - Actually, I wanted to see if you...\\
258 - Ow!\\
259 - Oh!\\
260 - [panting]\\
261 - Okay. Oh, my God.\\
262 - How 'bout a little heads-up next time?\\
263 - Okay, heads-up.\\
264 - Hey! [panting]\\
265 - So, why are you here?\\
266 - Uh, well... [laughs]\\
267 - Well, um, my-my friend Jenny--\\
268 - she thinks that you're really cool.\\
269 - And this is kind of awkward.\\
270 - I don't really know how to say this.\\
271 - Take her out again!\\
272 - Yeah, I don't know.\\
273 - I mean, I like to keep it casual.\\
274 - Lesbians get too attached,\\
275 - and then somebody always ends up screaming or crying.\\
276 - [screams, crying]\\
277 - I get that.\\
278 - Um, uh, but here's the thing.\\
279 - Like,\\
280 - Jenny's really awesome,\\
281 - and I think if you took a chance\\
282 - to get to know her that you would really like her.\\
283 - Yeah? I don't know. Turn over.\\
284 - What?\\
285 - All fours, butt up.\\
286 - Oh. This...\\
287 - This reminds me of a horrible prison nightmare I once had.\\
288 - You know, I got to say, if you're willing\\
289 - to go through all of this for your friend,\\
290 - she must be all right, huh?\\
291 - Yeah. I'll give her a call.\\
292 - [sighs] Okay.\\
293 - This one's gonna hurt.\\
294 - This one?\\
295 - [shouting]: Mommy!\\
296 - [sighs]\\
297 - Whoa.\\
298 - Some might say that a guy who does this\\
299 - out in the open wants his housekeeper to catch him.\\
300 - No, I-I... [sighs]\\
301 - Oh, hey, Johnson and Johnson.\\
302 - And Johnson.\\
303 - [laughs]\\
304 - Oh.\\
305 - [laughs]\\
306 - Hold on.\\
307 - Weren't you the one that called the house meeting\\
308 - about no more masturbating in the kitchen?\\
309 - No, I... I, uh...\\
310 - I got groomed.\\
311 - Actually,\\
312 - I went down to Brooke's salon...\\
313 - and asked her if she would go out with you again.\\
314 - Are you insane?!\\
315 - What, you think I can't get my own dates?\\
316 - Do I look like a child?\\
317 - No, but thanks to Brooke, I do.\\
318 - And thanks to me,\\
319 - she wants to go out with you again.\\
320 - She wants to go out with me again?\\
321 - What did she say?\\
322 - You want to rap about it?\\
323 - She said that she would call you in a few days,\\
324 - and that my balls would stop burning by tomorrow.\\
325 - Or wait.\\
326 - Was it that she would call you tomorrow,\\
327 - and my balls would stop burning in a few days?\\
328 - Let me know when she calls.\\
329 - Okay?\\
330 - Thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\\
331 - You are welcome from the bottom of my scrotum.\\
332 - [panting]\\
333 - Wow. That was amazing.\\
334 - [both laugh]\\
335 - I got to tell you.\\
336 - The guy who built your hoo-hah is an artist.\\
337 - Aw.\\
338 - He's like van Gogh, but instead of cutting off ears,\\
339 - he's cutting off... well, you know.\\
340 - [sighing]\\
341 - Hey. What?\\
342 - Can we talk about us?\\
343 - Oh, God, can't I... can't I just buy you something?\\
344 - Well, gifts are always welcome,\\
345 - but, uh, I was just wondering if we were exclusive.\\
346 - Okay, look, Alan...\\
347 - [panting]\\
348 - ...I like you, but I always... I always promised myself\\
349 - that if I had the courage to become a real woman,\\
350 - that that woman...\\
351 - would be a total slut.\\
352 - Okay, so-so... so, just to clarify...\\
353 - Mm-hmm.\\
354 - ...you... or me are free\\
355 - to date anybody else, anybody in the world?\\
356 - Yes.\\
357 - Okay, if that's what you want.\\
358 - [laughs]\\
359 - Oh, hey, you look great.\\
360 - No, I don't.\\
361 - I've tried on, like, a hundred outfits.\\
362 - Butch, femme, lipstick, pixie.\\
363 - There was even a dark moment\\
364 - where I was wearing one of Alan's polos.\\
365 - Oh, actually, they're called "polas."\\
366 - He buys them at a gas station.\\
367 - If you look close, the guy's not playing polo.\\
368 - It's a gardener riding a donkey.\\
369 - I'm a nervous wreck.\\
370 - Oh, come on. You're going to be fine.\\
371 - Just be yourself. Right.\\
372 - Right. Right, just be myself.\\
373 - W.W.J.D.?\\
374 - What would Jenny drink?\\
375 - I don't think that alcohol is the answer.\\
376 - Well, clearly, you don't know the question.\\
377 - On vodka, on soda,\\
378 - on blender, on mixer!\\
379 - Okay, I'm just gonna go back to blowing myself.\\
380 - So, uh, did you ask Santa for anything special this year?\\
381 - Oh, just someone to stuff my stocking.\\
382 - Oh. Someone's on the naughty list.\\
383 - Well, I hope that won't keep me from getting a nice big package.\\
384 - Oh, don't you worry.\\
385 - I'm sure Santa's got something in his sack for you.\\
386 - Ooh, look who's on the naughty list now.\\
387 - [laughs]\\
388 - But you have to be careful\\
389 - about shipping rates around the holidays.\\
390 - You could pay extra for a package that's oversized\\
391 - or an irregular shape.\\
392 - Rachel?\\
393 - Paula?\\
394 - Alan? What's going on here?\\
395 - Uh, well, this is a... an awkward coincidence.\\
396 - It's not a coincidence. I come here every Friday night,\\
397 - and she knows it.Oh, this is completely innocent.\\
398 - Oh, please. You're wearing my screw-me pumps!\\
399 - That's funny. Uh, I have a screw-me pump, too.\\
400 - I only need it when I'm drinking too much.\\
401 - All the women in the world, and you have to pick my ex-wife?\\
402 - Uh, first of all, I don't actually get to pick.\\
403 - I'm more of a take-what-comes kind of guy.\\
404 - Besides, you said we weren't exclusive.\\
405 - Oh. Yeah, he can date whoever he wants.\\
406 - Okay, you only brought him here to make me jealous.\\
407 - Oh, please. Don't flatter yourself.\\
408 - Okay, let's all... let's just calm down here.\\
409 - Hey, I see it now.\\
410 - You guys do have the same boobs.\\
411 - Jenny?\\
412 - Are you okay?\\
413 - I'll be right there.\\
414 - Can you knock again so I can find the door?\\
415 - Okay, I'm coming in.\\
416 - Hey.\\
417 - Hey, Walden!\\
418 - Are you drunk?\\
419 - No, I only had one drink.\\
420 - Okay, I went to a lot of trouble for you,\\
421 - and you are going on this date.\\
422 - Why do you care so much?\\
423 - Well, I can give you a bro-zilian reasons why.\\
424 - Now, come on.\\
425 - Let's get you sobered up.Okay, let me just use\\
426 - the bathroom real quick.\\
427 - Jenny?\\
428 - That's not the bathroom.\\
429 - Too late.\\
430 - How could you do this to me?\\
431 - It hurts losing the man of your dreams, doesn't it?\\
432 - Please. Alan is not the man of my dreams.\\
433 - He's just the only guy who didn't think\\
434 - an inside-out wiener was a deal breaker.\\
435 - I've also been told I have nice eyes, but okay.\\
436 - Well, you werethe man of my dreams.\\
437 - Don't you see what's going on here?\\
438 - You still care for her,\\
439 - and you're just trying to make her jealous\\
440 - by dating a sexy, handsome, well-endowed man.\\
441 - I do still have feelings for you.\\
442 - And you still have feelings for her,\\
443 - despite taking a lover whose charm and wit is only matched\\
444 - by his unbridled passion in the boudoir.\\
445 - I do miss you.\\
446 - I miss you, too.\\
447 - Oh, how nice is this?\\
448 - You two should kiss.\\
449 - Come here.\\
450 - You two are probably gonna want a picture of this.\\
451 - Let's get some coffee in you.\\
452 - Okay, I'll have a half-caff Zach Braff.\\
453 - [snoring] Oh.\\
454 - Perfect.\\
455 - [doorbell rings, Walden scoffs]\\
456 - It's a tale as old as time.\\
457 - Don't wax your ass to help your roommate's lesbian niece.\\
458 - Hey, Waldo!\\
459 - Hi, Baldo.\\
460 - Brooke, are you drunk?\\
461 - No, I'm merloaded.\\
462 - You drank that whole bottle yourself?\\
463 - It's okay. I'm gonna eat later. Shh.\\
464 - Come on.\\
465 - I'm sorry.\\
466 - I never do second dates,\\
467 - and I was nervous 'cause I really like Jenny.\\
468 - Hello. Hey, there's Jenny!\\
469 - Okay, nap date.\\
470 - Uh, good idea. Mm.\\
471 - How cute.\\
472 - It's like two drunk, gay puppies.\\
473 - Ah. They're gonna want a picture of this later.\\
474 -     Men.    \\
475 - WALDEN: 'Twas the night before Christmas\\
476 - when all down the beach not a creature was stirring,\\
477 - not even a leech.\\
478 - Alan was nestled, all snug in his bed,\\
479 - while visions of lesbians danced in his head.\\
480 - Brooke and Jenny were sleeping, a long winter's nap,\\
481 - surrounded by bottles with nary a cap.\\
482 - Jenny was nervous and frightened,\\
483 - but took a big chance.\\
484 - She let Brooke in her heart, as well as her pants.\\
485 - While Berta in her vest and I in my hattie\\
486 - had just baked our brains out\\
487 - with a big Christmas fatty.\\
488 - We started to doze, we hadn't a care.\\
489 - Happy Christmas to all. My balls have no hair.\\

1 -     Men.   \\
2 - We got to go.\\
3 - We just got here.\\
4 - Yeah, I know, but I got to go.\\
5 - The sit-down "go."\\
6 - No, I am... I am tired of being a slave\\
7 - to your fear of public bathrooms.\\
8 - Do you know what people do in there?\\
9 - They go to the bathroom.\\
10 - Exactly. It's-It's not the seat as much as...\\
11 - [whispers]: the splash.\\
12 - You have ruined a lot of things that I enjoy,\\
13 - and I am not gonna let you take pooping from me.\\
14 - Oh, fine, but every time you use a public bathroom,\\
15 - you are putting your ass\\
16 - against every other ass that has ever been there.\\
17 - See this guy?\\
18 - I might as well rub my naked butt all over his.\\
19 - And he took pooping from me.\\
20 - Excuse me. Walden?\\
21 - Yes?\\
22 - I-I'm sure you don't remember me,\\
23 - but I used to work for you.\\
24 - Sorry, I don't remember your name.\\
25 - It's Nicole, but you'd always call me Michelle.\\
26 - Right! Michelle!\\
27 - Yeah. Hey.\\
28 - How you doing? I-I haven't seen you\\
29 - around the office in a while.\\
30 - Yeah, I stopped going in after you fired me.\\
31 - Oh. Wow.\\
32 - That is...\\
33 - Are you here to kill me?\\
34 - I'm actually trying to get a tech start-up off the ground.\\
35 - Or as my mom calls it,\\
36 - wasting 20 hours a day in the garage\\
37 - and not giving her grandkids.\\
38 - Let me guess: You're looking for help.\\
39 - With the company,\\
40 - not the grandkids.\\
41 - I mean, not that\\
42 - I wouldn't want to... with you...\\
43 - Can you talk now?\\
44 - I amlooking for help... with the company.\\
45 - I'll let you know about the grandkids.\\
46 - Well, I would love to hear about it.\\
47 - Why don't you call my office, and we'll set something up?\\
48 - Yeah, when I worked for you, I was kind of in charge\\
49 - of blowing off the people you told to "call your office."\\
50 - So you get it.\\
51 - [laughs]\\
52 - Look, 15 years ago,\\
53 - you cornered Bill Gates in a steam room,\\
54 - and you pitched him the idea for Blungogo.com,\\
55 - and six months later, you were a billionaire.\\
56 - Yeah, what you don't know is\\
57 - that I also got Tased in the nuts\\
58 - by a security guard named Randy.\\
59 - Look, I think I have a really good idea.\\
60 - Everything you need to know is right in here.\\
61 - Okay. I'll take a look at it.\\
62 - Thank you.\\
63 - I didn't even have to get Tased in the lady nuts.\\
64 - I still might Tase you later.\\
65 - [laughs]\\
66 - Oh, it's not weird.\\
67 - We-we know each other.\\
68 - I fired her.\\
69 - I couldn't do it.\\
70 - We got to go. Now. Now!\\
71 - What?\\
72 - This is not a drill!\\
73 - Code brown! Code brown!\\
74 - I wonder if I could train him to go in the yard.\\
75 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
76 -     Ah.         Men.         Men.    \\
77 -     Men.   \\
78 - [panting]\\
79 - Wow.\\
80 - Oh.\\
81 - Yeah, that was fun. [sighs]\\
82 - Two thumbs up.\\
83 - Felt like more than that.\\
84 - Hey, uh, thanks for letting me stay over.\\
85 - Thanks for letting me stay under.\\
86 - Mmm.\\
87 - You know, I've been thinking--\\
88 - we've been doing this for a couple of weeks,\\
89 - and I don't know that much about you.\\
90 - Well, you know all the important things.\\
91 - My favorite color's pink, my favorite singer is Pink,\\
92 - my favorite body part is...\\
93 - Okay, fine. If you don't want to talk,\\
94 - we don't have to talk.\\
95 - No, I'm kidding.\\
96 - Come on, ask me anything.\\
97 - Tell me about your family. What's your mom like?\\
98 - Well, she's very, very pretty.\\
99 - Mm-hmm. Not too bright.\\
100 - Her boyfriend went to Harvard Law School,\\
101 - and then broke up with her, because he wanted a Jackie,\\
102 - and she was more of a Marilyn,\\
103 - so she decided to study real hard...\\
104 - Hold on a second.\\
105 - That's the plot to Legally Blonde.\\
106 - You saw that, huh?\\
107 - Uh, all right, I'll-I'll... I'll tell you the truth.\\
108 - My mom is a beautiful prostitute.\\
109 - Oh. And my dad,\\
110 - Richard Gere...\\
111 - You're unbelievable.\\
112 - Cut me some slack!\\
113 - I grew up in a town that didn't allow dancing!\\
114 -     Men.   \\
115 - Mm. Good morning.\\
116 - Actually, it's a great morning.\\
117 - Somebody gave me a billion-dollar idea.\\
118 - Oh, you got my e-mail.\\
119 - You know, with my idea.\\
120 - The app that helps you find a clean public restroom\\
121 - anywhere in the world.\\
122 - I called it "Crapster."\\
123 - Yeah, as good of an idea as that is,\\
124 - and actually, it's not that bad,\\
125 - I'm talking about thought-recognition.\\
126 - Thought-control computing.\\
127 - Imagine you want to send a text,\\
128 - but, uh, you don't want to take your phone out.\\
129 - Or imagine you want to change the channel on the TV,\\
130 - but you don't have a remote.\\
131 - Imagine you're in a strange city,\\
132 - and you can't find a clean bathroom.\\
133 - Imagine you're in Italy,\\
134 - and you have to "arriva-doody."\\
135 - You know what?\\
136 - Here is a hundred dollars.\\
137 - I just bought your idea.\\
138 - Now, stop talking about it.\\
139 - Deal. Looks like I am getting that filling after all.\\
140 - Morning.Good morning.\\
141 - Oh, hey, morning.\\
142 - What are you guys up to today?\\
143 - I don't know. Maybe we'll go to a bar\\
144 - and let guys buy us drinks\\
145 - if we're willing to make out with each other.\\
146 - ALLAN: Wait.\\
147 - Is-is that a thing?\\
148 - You and I should run that scam with girls.\\
149 - Hey, I've got an idea.\\
150 - Let's go for a hike in the canyon.\\
151 - I'd rather stay home and yodel in your canyon.\\
152 -     Yodel-ay-hee hoo-ha!    \\
153 - Come on, let's get some fresh air, hang out.\\
154 - Just the two of us.\\
155 - Uh, yeah. Yeah, why not? Sounds great.\\
156 - [clears her throat] Do you guys want to join us?\\
157 - Sure.\\
158 - You can never have too much wood in the forest.\\
159 - I can't. I'm busy.\\
160 - Always busy.\\
161 - I can't remember the last time this one took me anywhere.\\
162 - Hey, uh, Jenny,\\
163 - here's a hundred dollars.\\
164 - Lose him in the forest.\\
165 -     Men.   \\
166 - Yes?\\
167 - Yeah, I'm looking for Nicole.\\
168 - Are you my new dad?\\
169 - Excuse me?\\
170 - It's a joke. Try to keep up.\\
171 - Who are you?\\
172 - I'm Walden Schmidt.\\
173 - Holy Schmidt!\\
174 - Oh, my God.\\
175 - Mr. Schmidt, it is such an honor to meet you.\\
176 - I have a poster of you.\\
177 - A poster?\\
178 - Yeah, yeah, check it out.\\
179 - I made it in college.\\
180 - WALDEN: Wow. It's, uh...\\
181 - Wow.\\
182 - I cut and pasted Laura Dern's hair onto your face.\\
183 - It's pretty breathtaking, right?\\
184 - I'm sorry... uh, who are you?\\
185 - Oh, uh, I-I'm Barry. Barry Foster.\\
186 - But you can call me "BF," as in your biggest fan.\\
187 - [laughs]\\
188 - Walden!\\
189 - Nicole, hi.\\
190 - I read your proposal.\\
191 - I'm interested.\\
192 - Really?\\
193 - This is amazing.\\
194 - This is amazing. [laughing]\\
195 - Oh, my fan fiction's come true.\\
196 - NICOLE: Barry,\\
197 - we talked about this.\\
198 - Right, right. Boundaries.\\
199 - All right, here's-here's what I'm prepared to do.\\
200 - In return for 51% of your company,\\
201 - and him never hugging me again,\\
202 - I will back your project.\\
203 - I don't think I can do that.\\
204 - Neither do I. [laughs]\\
205 - Barry!\\
206 - Okay.\\
207 - Look, I can't give up control.\\
208 - This company is my baby.\\
209 - But I will sell you a minority share\\
210 - if you agree to work as my product engineer.\\
211 - Oh, product engineer?\\
212 - I mean, do I look like Barry?\\
213 - No offense, Barry.\\
214 - Did you hear that? He knows my name.\\
215 - I'm sorry, that's all I can offer you.\\
216 - Well, then it's a pass.\\
217 - All right, thanks for stopping by.\\
218 - No, no, no, come on, this isn't how the story ends.\\
219 - Hold on. Th...\\
220 - That's it? No negotiating?\\
221 - You heard my offer.\\
222 - There's also a supplemental offer--\\
223 - uh, best friends for life.\\
224 - All right, wait. All right, fine. I...\\
225 - I will... work for you,\\
226 - but I still need a majority position.\\
227 - Good-bye, Mr. Schmidt.\\
228 - What are you, like, some kind of evil Bond villain?\\
229 - All right... all right, all right, fine!\\
230 - Deal.\\
231 - I'll... be your number two.\\
232 - [clearing throat] Well...\\
233 - it'd actually be number three, but...\\
234 -     Men.   \\
235 - Oh, thank God.\\
236 - [panting]\\
237 - I'm coming, Charlie.\\
238 - I hope you have a guest room in heaven.\\
239 - You shouldn't feel so bad.\\
240 - He's in pretty good shape for a guy in his 60's.\\
241 - He's 45.\\
242 - Whoa.\\
243 - I'll be right back.\\
244 - Ah... uh... do you mind?\\
245 - Actually... [screams]\\
246 - Aah! It burns! It burns!\\
247 - That's because it's vodka.\\
248 - Who brings vodka on a hike?\\
249 - Someone who thinks hikes should be fun.\\
250 - Okay, that's it, I'm packing it in.\\
251 - I think I saw a mom with a stroller.\\
252 - I'm gonna hitch a ride back downhill.\\
253 - No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
254 - Don't leave me alone with Brooke.\\
255 - What? Why not? She's great.\\
256 - Well, here's the thing.\\
257 - She's-she's... she's always trying to...\\
258 - get to know me.\\
259 - That bitch.\\
260 - She's always asking me these-these personal things.\\
261 - You know?\\
262 - "What are your dreams?" "What was your childhood like?"\\
263 - "What's your last name?"\\
264 - You are just like your dad.\\
265 - He'd never open up to anybody\\
266 - 'cause he was afraid of rejection,\\
267 - so he'd reject them first.\\
268 - I don't want to reject Brooke.\\
269 - So, let her in.\\
270 - If you don't take a chance, you haven't got one.\\
271 - Do you think I really believed\\
272 - that a complete stranger would let me live\\
273 - in his Malibu beach house forever?\\
274 - No. But I took a chance, and it paid off.\\
275 -     Men.   \\
276 - [speaking lyrics]: Everybody get up, everybody get up...\\
277 - [singing]:     Hey, hey, hey    \\
278 -     Hey, hey, hey    \\
279 -     Hey, hey, hey...    \\
280 - Hey, hey, hey!\\
281 - Oh, sorry.\\
282 - Sometimes when I'm writing code,\\
283 - I get kind of lost in my dope jams.\\
284 - Well, if you're gonna play music, just play it out loud.\\
285 - You got it, number three.\\
286 -     Talk about getting blasted    \\
287 - [singing along]:     I hate these blurred lines    \\
288 -     I know you want it    \\
289 - [singing along]:     I know you want it    \\
290 -     I know you want it, but you're    \\
291 -     A good girl    \\
292 -     The way you grab me    \\
293 -     Talkin' 'bout gettin' nasty    \\
294 -     Go ahead, get at me    \\
295 -     Everybody get up    \\
296 -     What do they make dreams for    \\
297 -     When you got them jeans on    \\
298 -     What do we need steam for    \\
299 -     You the hottest bitch    \\
300 -     In this place    Hey, hey, hey!\\
301 -     You want to hug me...    \\
302 - [music stops]\\
303 - It was the new guy's idea. I was...\\
304 - What's that, Barry? I can't hear you\\
305 - from all the way under this bus.\\
306 - So, how's the code coming?\\
307 - Actually, you know, I had a thought.\\
308 - Um, if we reconfigure this kernel,\\
309 - we're gonna save a lot of time and money.\\
310 - Yeah, it's-it's good.\\
311 - [high-pitched]: It's just, uh... eh, it's-it's good.\\
312 - Wha-What do you think, Barry?\\
313 - [high-pitched]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
314 - It's-it's good. It's good.\\
315 - Why do you guys keep talking with high voices?\\
316 - Why do you keep saying, [high-pitched]: "It's good"?\\
317 - It is good.\\
318 - Just, you know, for...\\
319 - mmm... 2002.\\
320 - Ouch.\\
321 - I believe the correct terminology in 2002\\
322 - was, "Oh, snap."\\
323 - [clears throat] Okay. Um...\\
324 - you know, I've been... I've been doing this for a...\\
325 - a really long time,\\
326 - and I've-I've been really successful.\\
327 - I know. We studied you in school.\\
328 - Oh, I get it. You guys... you guys are saying that I'm old?\\
329 - No. Yeah.\\
330 - I thought we were going a different way.\\
331 - Look, I respect you enormously, but...\\
332 - I got to go with my gut.\\
333 - Okay. No problem.\\
334 - You're the boss.\\
335 - Thank you.\\
336 - Now, who wants Chinese?\\
337 - Are you paying? 'Cause I forgot my wallet...\\
338 - Yes, Barry.\\
339 - Hey, I got one just like him at home.\\
340 - Boy, oh, boy, you could cut the sexual tension back there\\
341 - with a knife.\\
342 - Think she's into me?\\
343 - No, not you. Me.\\
344 - Me and her have had this whole "will they, won't they" thing\\
345 - going on for some time now.\\
346 - So it's like a...\\
347 - Ross/Rachel thing?\\
348 - Who?\\
349 - Are those friends of yours?\\
350 - Oh, God. I am old.\\
351 - But with age comes wisdom.\\
352 - [clears throat]\\
353 - We're gonna do this my way.\\
354 - What?\\
355 - Nicole is wrong about the code.\\
356 - I'm sending you a file. We're gonna rewrite it.\\
357 - Oh, this is bad.\\
358 - This is bad.\\
359 - I'm stuck between my hero\\
360 - and-and the future mother of my children.\\
361 - Come on, Barry.\\
362 - Don't you want to be on a poster with me?\\
363 - Hop on the eagle, man. Let's soar together.\\
364 - I don't know. I don't... I don't know.\\
365 - You know you want it.\\
366 -     You know you want it    \\
367 -     You know you want it    \\
368 -     I'm a good girl    \\
369 -     Men.   \\
370 -     Men.   Oh, good. You're home.\\
371 - I need to talk to you. Oh,\\
372 - you know, actually, I'm not.\\
373 - I'm just here for the essentials.\\
374 - Shower, change of clothes, bag of performance-enhancing weed.\\
375 - Th-This won't take long.\\
376 - Uh, will you look at this picture?\\
377 - Let me see.\\
378 - Was this taken from the Mars rover?\\
379 - No, that's my balls.\\
380 - [groans]\\
381 - Dude! What the hell?\\
382 - They've been burning ever since I went on that hike.\\
383 - Maybe somebody's talking about 'em.\\
384 - No, I'm serious. What could it be?\\
385 - I don't know. What, like, poison oak?\\
386 - I did take a leak in the bushes.\\
387 - And yet you couldn't go in a coffee shop.\\
388 - Just look at the picture.\\
389 - Yeah. Fine. I can't believe I'm gonna...\\
390 - zoom in on your balls.\\
391 - I'm not gonna be able to...\\
392 - Oh, my God.\\
393 - It's a tick.\\
394 - What?\\
395 - You got a tick on your junk.\\
396 - Oh, God!\\
397 - Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!\\
398 - What's with him?\\
399 - He's got a tick on his 'nads.\\
400 - Huh. I never thought anything could live off Zippy.\\
401 -     Men.   \\
402 - I don't see how this is gonna make us more productive,\\
403 - but I really don't care.\\
404 - And that is the beauty of pot. [chuckles]\\
405 - You got work to do, you don't care.\\
406 - You got bills to pay, you don't care. [chuckles]\\
407 - You see a picture of your roommate's gonads...\\
408 - you care.\\
409 - [chuckles]\\
410 - But the image is fading.\\
411 - Yeah, marijuana is excellent.\\
412 - I don't know why I waited this long to try it.\\
413 - Wait a second-- you've never been high before?\\
414 - I wanted it to be special. And now I can tell everybody\\
415 - my first time was with Walden Schmidt.\\
416 - Hey, when you tell that story,\\
417 - maybe throw in a few more details.\\
418 - [chuckles] Hey, aren't you glad we took a second to relax?\\
419 - Mmm. Totally.\\
420 - You know, I kind of forgot the meaning of the word "relax."\\
421 - Relax, relax, relax.\\
422 - Oh, God. I don't remember what it means either.\\
423 - I'm losing my words.\\
424 - No, this is exactly, exactly\\
425 - what the commercials warned me about.\\
426 - Barry, calm down.\\
427 - Just take a deep breath, close your eyes, count to ten.\\
428 - All right, I trust you with my life.\\
429 - You're my best friend.\\
430 - One...\\
431 - two...\\
432 - Oh, my God, we have ice cream sandwiches in the freezer.\\
433 - Hey, man, grab me one!\\
434 - Mmm, no, grab me two!\\
435 - I want to make an ice cream sandwich sandwich.\\
436 - That is an awesome idea.\\
437 - Are you staring at me or am I just really paranoid?\\
438 - There's nothing to be paranoid about.\\
439 - She's on to us. Abort. I repeat, abort.\\
440 - I hate you.\\
441 - You don't. You like me.\\
442 - You know what. Doesn't matter.\\
443 - Because I have a policy about dating people I work with.\\
444 - Yeah, but it's your policy, so...\\
445 - you can break it.\\
446 - You're the boss.\\
447 - I am, aren't I?\\
448 - I guess that makes me the wo-man.\\
449 - You guys.\\
450 - I got great news.\\
451 - Ice cream sandwiches are in the oven.\\
452 - They'll be ready in five.\\
453 -     Men.   \\
454 - You want a refill?\\
455 - Uh, no, I-I don't want to get drunk.\\
456 - Oh, my God, did I somehow get you pregnant?\\
457 - I want to get to know you better,\\
458 - and I don't want anything to get in the way of that.\\
459 - I really like you. Um...\\
460 - That's new for me.\\
461 - Hey, I feel the exact same way.\\
462 - I've never felt this vulnerable with someone.\\
463 - You know, when it didn't involve a safe word.\\
464 - So what are we gonna do?\\
465 - We can start by being honest with each other.\\
466 - That's horrible. Hey.\\
467 - Come on. Let's do this.\\
468 - Tell me a secret, something you've never told anyone else.\\
469 - Something is wrong with my balls.\\
470 - Something like that.\\
471 - I just... I-I had a tick and I pulled it off\\
472 - and now they won't stop swelling\\
473 - and I'm afraid they're gonna explode.\\
474 - So why are you telling us?\\
475 - Because Brooke works in a salon.\\
476 - She waxes people. Maybe she's seen something like this before.\\
477 - All right, l-let's see.\\
478 - Oh!\\
479 - Oh...\\
480 - Boy, if I wasn't gay before...\\
481 -     Men.   \\
482 - [exhales] Check it out, dude.\\
483 - Where's your other hand in that picture?\\
484 - What the hell?\\
485 - Three people can't fit on an eagle.\\
486 - You-you changed my code.\\
487 - Yeah. I made it better.\\
488 - No, you didn't. We went over this.\\
489 - [chuckles] Okay. Everybody who's made a billion dollars\\
490 - off their software in this room, raise your hand.\\
491 - [gasps, chuckles]\\
492 - Look at that. It's just me.Okay.\\
493 - Everyone who owns 51% of this company, raise their hand.\\

506 - You're fired.\\
507 - [whirring]\\
508 - Oh, snap.\\
509 - Look, I-I was just trying to help.\\

512 - You should just... you should just go, dude.\\
513 - Okay.\\
514 - Fine.\\

520 - All right.\\
521 - Oh, uh, one last thing.\\
522 - We're done.\\
523 - I don't work with you anymore.\\
524 - That's what "you're fired" means.\\
525 - Good. So this isn't a bad idea anymore.\\
526 - Can I be fired, too?\\
527 -     Men.   \\
528 -     Men.    Okay. [grunts] Okay.\\
529 - Um, I just, uh, want to point out that,\\
530 - uh, due to my engorged testicles,\\
531 - uh, my penis is not currently to scale,\\
532 - so...\\
533 - Yeah, yeah, here it is.\\
534 - When you pulled out the tick, you didn't get all of it\\
535 - so it got inflamed. Oh.\\

538 - but only your balls got angry.\\
539 - You know, this is what relationships are all about.\\

165 - What's wrong with you?\\
166 - Wait, I keep a list on the fridge.\\
167 - Why in the world would you agree to go on a double-date\\
168 - with me and Larry?\\
169 - Okay. You are just upset,\\
170 - because you are gonna have to watch me be with someone else,\\
171 - the same way I have to watch you be with Larry.\\
172 - [Lyndsey sighs]This is just a taste of your own medicine.\\
173 - Jealous-in. Use as directed.\\
174 - Side effects include tears, sleepless nights,\\
175 - and possible rage masturbation.\\
176 - Number one, he's stupid.\\
177 - Number two, smells like mushroom soup.\\
178 - Number three, he dates that desperate chick who...\\
179 - Number four...\\
180 - Walden?\\
181 - Hey, Bar-Bar. Is Nicole there?\\
182 - Uh... let me see...\\

186 - I think you meant meeting.\\
187 - Did I? [whispering]: Did I?\\
188 - Walden, hi.\\
189 - Kinda busy. What's up?\\
190 - I... have something for you.\\
191 - Hang on.\\
192 - [sighs] I hate that she made me lie.\\
193 - I-I love you.\\
194 - That was weird.\\
195 - But at, but at least, at least it wasn't a lie.\\
196 - You didn't want to come to dinner.\\
197 - So, I brought dinner to you.\\
198 - Oh, great. I am starving.\\
199 - Oh, Barry. It's, it's just for Nicole.\\
200 - Is it because I lied to you?\\
201 - No. It's because I like kissing her just a littlebit more.\\
202 - This is really sweet.\\
203 - But I have somuch to do.\\
204 - Come on...\\
205 - My poor housekeeper slaved all day\\
206 - to make us this delicious... note...\\
207 - that says, "I don't cook. Love, Berta."\\
208 - Well-- I-I brought you wine... and cheese...\\
209 - and... no fricking corkscrew. [nervously laughs]\\

217 - It, it really is my birthday.\\

219 - just because I agreed to do this,\\
220 - I don't want you to get the wrong idea.\\
221 - [British accent]: Well, it's too late.\\
222 - Once the lady accepts the man's cheese,\\
223 - they must marry.\\
224 - [British accent]: But I am betrothed to a goatherd.\\
225 - Is that a smile? Are you actually having fun?\\
226 - [laughs] Uh... yes, but I really have to get back to work.\\
227 - Let me help you.\\
228 - We tried that.\\
229 - BARRY [over speaker]: Give him a chance...\\
230 - Barry, what did we talk about?\\
231 - Digital boundaries.\\
232 - Am I the only one feeling a connection here?\\
233 - Of course not.\\
234 - But, because of that, you're gonna be a distraction.\\
235 - Well, I-I promise to wear a conservative top.\\
236 - And to tape down all my fun parts.\\
237 - Uh... All right. I will let you help.\\
238 - But, until we're done,\\

265 - Maybe the problem's you, Jeff.\\
266 - I don't think so.\\
267 - I think you're yummy.\\
268 - Well, uh... I have been using a coconut body butter.GWEN: Oh.\\

322 - We just, we just need to... rebootit.\\
323 - You say the guy's coming out tomorrow?\\
324 - Yes, geniuses.\\
325 - Now, will you help me figure out\\
326 - why this algorithm isn't working?\\
327 - Maybe it's on a Java break.\\
328 - [Barry laughs]\\
329 - Did you get it? Like java and Java...?\\
330 - That joke killed at MIT open mic night.\\
331 - What do you got?\\
332 - You-- oh... this pointer is undefined.\\
333 - Oh. Right. Of course.\\
334 - So, uh... guess you got it from here.\\
335 - What are we waiting for?\\
336 - I mean, let's just do this.\\
337 - Really?\\
338 - What about Barry?\\
339 - He can film it.\\
340 - What?\\
341 - I mean, we're gonna want to\\
342 - watch it again and again.\\

344 - This is a pleasant surprise. [laughs]\\
345 - Here, let's test it.\\
346 - Oh... yeah, right, the device.Mm-hmm.\\
347 - That's exactly what we were talking about.\\
348 - Good. Now put that on.\\
349 - [whispering]: And stop thinking about sex.\\
350 - Well, it's harder than it looks.\\
351 - Well, it's a good thing you taped it down.\\
352 - Now...\\
353 - the first thing you think will be the first human thought\\
354 - recognized by a computer.\\
355 - It's not even reading the device.\\
356 - Now, you know what?\\
357 - I think I know what it is.\\
358 - If it's any consolation,\\
359 - I thought she was talking about sex, too.\\
360 - P.S. Just throwing this out there:\\
361 - totally up for filming.\\
362 -     Men.   \\
363 - Uh, uh-uh, let me ask you something.\\
364 - Um... uh, how do I put this?\\
365 - Um... i-i-is there a "grow room" before the "show room"?\\
366 - There's a blow room.\\
367 - How 'bout this?\\
368 - You said you wanted to spice things up.\\
369 - This seems pretty spicy.\\
370 - And it sure beats the hell out of couples' therapy, huh, Jeff?\\
371 - Uh, y-you know, if Lyndsey is uncomfortable,\\
372 - why don't you guys take off?\\
373 - Some people can't handle\\
374 - seeing their partner with someone else.\\
375 - You know what? I'm good.\\
376 - Besides, I've always wanted to sleep with Jeff.\\
377 - Wait. What?\\
378 - You heard me.\\
379 - Let's do this thing.\\
380 - I'm gonna go get us some drinks.\\
381 - I'll come with you.\\
382 - You're gonna be hearing that a lot tonight.\\
383 - Isn't this great, Jeff?\\
384 - I get to bang Gwen, and you get to bang Lyndsey.\\
385 - Yeah, that's one way to go.\\
386 - Um... Or I-I could have sex with Gwen,\\
387 - and you could do whatever the hell you want.\\
388 - [laughs] Come on, you're telling me\\
389 - when you're nailing someone,\\
390 - you never imagined it was Lyndsey?\\
391 - Never once.\\
392 - Well, you got the green light, buddy.\\
393 - This is so exciting.\\
394 - I haven't had sex with somebody new in a long time.\\
395 - Yeah, me neither.\\
396 -     Men.   \\
397 - You know...\\
398 - I'm cool with it if you want to word naked.\\
399 - Okay, there's a reason I didn't respond\\
400 - the first time you said it.\\
401 - Walden?\\
402 - I... need... it.\\
403 - Walden.\\
404 - I need it.What?\\
405 - The file you were supposed to send me.\\
406 - I need it.\\
407 - Oh... uh, yeah, right.\\

413 - Oh. Right. Yeah.\\
414 - Let me just...\\
415 - put it in.\\
416 - Oh, wow...\\
417 - This really sucks.\\
418 - We have so much work to do, and all I can think about\\
419 - is you and me, and oh, wow.\\
420 - Gotta stop thinking about sex.\\
421 - How are we gonna do that?\\
422 - BARRY: Oh, yeah.\\
423 - That's... what... daddy... likes...\\
424 - And that did it. [clears throat]\\
425 -     Men.   \\
426 - Is this seat taken?\\
427 - Oh.\\
428 - Very funny.\\
429 - Okay, good news, bad news.\\
430 - Bad news, Larry's with Gwen.\\
431 - Yeah. Not a big surprise.\\
432 - She's got boobs that could save your life\\
433 - in the event of a water landing.\\
434 - But the good news is,\\
435 - guess who's got two thumbs, and is banging you tonight.\\
436 - This guy...!\\
437 - Jeff Probst?!\\
438 - You ready, babe?Oh, yeah.\\
439 - Wait! What the hell?\\
440 - I told you I wanted to sleep with Jeff.\\
441 - But I'm Jeff.\\
442 - No, you're Alan.\\
443 - So, what do you say, blow room first?\\
444 - If you told Larry you were gay,\\
445 - none of this would have happened.\\
446 - [sighs]Wait. That guy's not gay?\\
447 -     Men.   \\
448 - [moans]\\
449 - Thanks again for the birthday pudding, you guys.\\
450 - I love pudding.\\
451 - It's even fun to say.\\
452 - Pu-dding.\\
453 - I'm putting pudding in my mouth.\\
454 - [laughs hysterically]\\
455 - [laughing]: Oh, my God. That's funny.\\
456 - [Barry continues laughing]\\
457 - Looks like the birthday weed is kicking in.\\
458 - Putting pudding. Putting pudding.\\
459 - Okay. Now I'm gonna switch it up,\\
460 - and see if you can tell the difference.\\
461 - Pudding putting.\\
462 - Pudding putting.\\
463 - Oh, my God. I got it.\\
464 - Did you?\\
465 - The-The-The function.\\
466 - It's recursive.\\
467 - It keeps getting stuck in the subroutine.\\
468 - This is, this is it.\\
469 - You sure?\\
470 - Yeah. No, check it out.\\
471 - This is history.\\
472 - This is like Alexander Graham Bell saying,\\

1 -     Men.   \\
2 - So, Marty, uh, what are we celebrating?\\
3 - My prostate exam.\\
4 - Doctor gave me a thumbs up.\\
5 - At least it felt like a thumb.\\
6 - Well, I'm glad to hear you're in good health.\\
7 - Yes, he said I could live another ten years\\
8 - if I give up alcohol.\\
9 - Yeah, but you're drinking Scotch.\\
10 - He had a finger up my keister.\\
11 - What, am I gonna argue?\\
12 - It's true; he never complains when I put my...\\
13 - [watch beeping]\\
14 - What is that, the horrifying conversation alarm?\\
15 - [beeping continues]\\
16 - I was hoping it was a truck about to back over me.\\
17 - It's time for my pills.\\
18 - Evy, I think I left them in the car.\\
19 - Would you get them?Of course, dear.\\
20 - I think the keys are in my pocket.\\
21 - You may have to root around for them.\\
22 - Really nice try.\\
23 - I-I got to remember that.\\
24 - That's a good one.\\
25 - You actually have to own something to have keys.\\
26 - Okay, let me tell you why I'm really here.\\
27 - You know I have been dating your mother for some time now.\\
28 - Uh, actually, she's not my mom.\\
29 - Yeah, or mine.\\
30 - Well, you boys are a couple and she's your daughter,\\
31 - so we're like family.\\
32 - Oh.\\
33 - No, we're-we're not married.\\
34 - Oh, but someday.\\
35 - No, no, we-we don't want to get married.\\
36 - So why did you guys fight so hard for it?\\
37 - Yeah, come on, Walden.\\
38 - You're here, you're queer, get used to it.\\
39 - As I was saying,\\
40 - your mother is a beautiful, warm, compassionate woman.\\
41 - Everyone's entitled to their opinion.\\
42 - I would like to ask for her hand in marriage.\\
43 - Aw. Wow. What?\\
44 - So, what do you say?\\
45 - Can I make an honest woman out of your mother?\\
46 - I doubt it.\\
47 - But you have my blessing.\\
48 - Mine, too. Congratulations.\\
49 - Uh, wait, not-not so fast.\\
50 - I have a question first.\\
51 - Would you allow her son to come and live with you\\
52 - if his current living quarters were to, say,\\
53 - suddenly become a sauna?\\
54 - Any son of Evelyn's\\
55 - always has a place in my home.\\
56 - Welcome to the family, Dad.\\
57 - [door opens]\\
58 - Here are your pills, dear.\\
59 - Look at that, a hot chick carrying a bag of drugs.\\
60 - It's like 1970 all over again.\\
61 - Let's start with the muscle relaxers.\\
62 - One for you, two for me.\\
63 - Wow. What are all those for?\\
64 - It's a combination.\\
65 - Hardeners and softeners.\\
66 - I-I have to take these or...\\
67 - [grunting]\\
68 - Marty, are you okay?Quick, quick.\\
69 - P-Press the medic alert.\\
70 - What is this?\\
71 - This is a ring.\\
72 - I've fallen for you, and I can't get up.\\
73 - What are you saying?\\
74 - Will you marry me?\\
75 - I can't believe this.\\
76 - You are so romantic.\\
77 - Will I have to sign a prenup?\\
78 - Of course not.\\
79 - Then yes, yes.\\
80 - And I want your son to be my best man.\\
81 - Oh, my God, really?\\
82 - Not you; pretty boy over there.\\
83 - Oh.\\
84 - In my heart, I knew.\\
85 - Okay, but at the ceremony,\\
86 - I'm not gonna root around in your pocket for the ring.\\
87 - And, Jennifer, you'll be my maid of honor?\\
88 - [scoffs] Of course. It's like I'm not even here.\\
89 - Sweet. I love straight weddings.\\
90 - A bunch of drunk bridesmaids crying\\
91 - because they don't have a man.\\
92 - It's like eating fish in a barrel.\\
93 - So, where are we gonna have the ceremony?\\
94 - Why don't we just have it here at our place?\\
95 - Uh, maybe weshould discuss this\\
96 - before weoffer up ourplace.\\
97 - Do what I do; just go along with it,\\
98 - and later, take it out on him in the bedroom.\\
99 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
100 -     Ah.         Men.         Men.    \\
101 -     Men.   \\
102 - Oh, Berta, uh,\\
103 - can I try something out on you?\\
104 - There isn't enough alcohol in the world.\\
105 - No, I'm writing a toast for my mother's wedding.\\
106 - Uh, so far I've got, uh,\\
107 - "Ladies and gentlemen, I am so pleased\\
108 - "to welcome Marty Pepper to our family.\\
109 - "Uh, to know Marty is to love him.\\
110 - "He's a kind, sweet and generous man,\\
111 - "which proves once and for all\\
112 - that opposites really do attract."\\
113 - So, you're telling everyone you're a son of a bitch.\\
114 - I like it.\\
115 - Hey, Alan, I need your help\\
116 - planning this geriatric bachelor party.\\
117 - I started reaching out to the guys\\
118 - on Marty's invite list,\\
119 - and so far I got dead, dead, coma, Florida.\\
120 - Hey, uh, where you thinking about having this thing anyway?\\
121 - Well, at this point, either Boca\\
122 - or the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.\\
123 - How about a strip club?\\
124 - I know a place with a great all-you-can-eat buffet.\\
125 - Two things you never want to hear together. Mm-hmm.\\
126 - "Strip club" and "all-you-can-eat."\\
127 - Besides, Marty doesn't want strippers.\\
128 - You can't have a bachelor party without strippers.\\
129 - But more importantly,\\
130 - we can't let the last naked woman this man sees\\
131 - be my mother.\\
132 - My granddaughters do a great two-for-one show.\\
133 - I can get you a family discount.\\
134 - No, no.\\
135 - We... No strippers.\\
136 - We're just doing a nice steak dinner.\\
137 - Well, if there's not gonna be any strippers,\\
138 - then I'm not going.\\
139 - Actually, you're not on the list.\\
140 -     Men.   \\
141 - Okay, okay, one more time.\\
142 - I want a nice filet, medium-rare,\\
143 - and then you give it a nice sear,\\
144 - and then you put it in the food processor,\\
145 - and you give it a pump\\
146 - three times on chop-- boom, boom, boom--\\
147 - and two times on dice-- boom, boom.\\
148 - Thank you.\\
149 - Oh, uh,\\
150 - is, uh, this the party\\
151 - or the bathroom?\\
152 - Here. Over here, Tim.\\
153 - Oh.Yeah.\\
154 - Thank you.\\
155 - What's with the glasses?\\
156 - You look like Bono.\\
157 - I was fortunate enough to work with Bono.\\
158 - Yeah, and, uh, at the time, he was married to Cher.\\
159 - I just got back from the eye doctor.\\
160 - Boy, he robbed me blind.\\
161 - I can only read the top line of the eye chart.\\
162 - It says P.\\
163 - Then I have to.\\
164 - I-I'd like to, uh, to propose a toast.\\
165 - Uh, first to Walden\\
166 - for putting all this together at the last minute.\\
167 - Well, it was tough, but I managed to get a table\\
168 - at 3:00 p.m. on a Thursday.\\
169 - To Walden and his wife Alan.\\
170 - That is one ugly woman.\\
171 - Uh-huh.\\
172 - Um, my, uh,\\
173 - my mother and I have had our ups and downs,\\
174 - but I love her, and I want her to be happy.\\
175 - And you, Marty Pepper,\\
176 - make her happy, which means\\
177 - I love you.\\
178 - I thought we said no broads.\\
179 - I had a gay friend who was arrested for sodomy,\\
180 - and he had the charge reduced to following too closely.\\
181 - Uh, anyway,\\
182 - um, I want to wish you both the best. Cheers.\\
183 - Tim needs a drink.\\
184 - No, no, no, no, uh, I'm driving.\\
185 - Marty, last time I saw you,\\
186 - we were in a threesome with that cute little redhead.\\
187 - What ever happened to her?\\
188 - I'm marrying her.\\
189 - Nice girl.\\
190 - Hard worker.\\
191 - Well, I'd like to say on behalf of all of us, getting married?\\
192 - What the hell are you doing, Marty?\\
193 - Why do you need seven wives?\\
194 - You can barely get through nine holes of golf!\\
195 - She's a sweet kid, and I need a little warmth\\
196 - and comfort at the end of the day.\\
197 - Have you ever considered a nice piece of toast?\\
198 - [clears throat] Uh, well, I would like to say something.\\
199 - Uh... I might be in the minority here,\\
200 - but I still believe in love,\\
201 - and it's inspiring to know\\
202 - that even at your age, you can still find it.\\
203 - Now we have two broads.\\
204 - The kid is right.\\
205 - Nothing is more important than love,\\
206 - except a good opening weekend.\\
207 - And salt.\\
208 - Damn it, I really miss salt.\\
209 - Okay, we're here because we love this man.\\
210 - You know, not the way you two love each other.\\
211 - But...\\
212 - love, n-nonetheless.\\
213 - We're also here for the free steak, am I right? [chuckles]\\
214 - Excuse me.\\
215 - Who is this kid?\\
216 - He's Evelyn's son.\\
217 - Who's Evelyn?\\
218 - The woman I'm marrying.\\
219 - You're getting married?\\
220 - Mazel tov!\\
221 - Which one of you guys is... Marty?\\
222 - I'm Sugar.\\
223 - I'm Cinnamon.\\
224 - I'm rich!I'm richer!\\
225 - Hey, I thought we said no strippers.\\
226 - It's a bachelor party; loosen up.\\
227 - Hey, uh, Marty, you up for a lap dance?\\
228 - I haven't been up for a lap dance\\
229 - since the Reagan Administration.\\
230 - Governor Reagan's.\\
231 - I think I wrote that joke.\\
232 - Girls, give him something to remember.\\
233 - Uh, they're the green ones.\\
234 - Oh, uh, and don't forget,\\
235 - I'm only paying for an hour, so whether you're\\
236 - in the middle of a lap dance or CPR,\\
237 - you got to get out of there.\\
238 -     Men.   \\
239 - I want to find something Marty will like.\\
240 - I wonder if they have edible underwear for diabetics.\\
241 - Well, they do have something called\\
242 - "I Can't Believe It's Not Body Butter."\\
243 - [chuckles] Hey, you'd look good in these.\\
244 - No, dear, Marty would look good in them.\\
245 - Oh, you guys arekinky.\\
246 - If we got any kinkier, we'd upset the animal rights people.\\
247 - So, how about you, Jennifer?\\
248 - Are there wedding bells in your future?\\
249 - It is legal now.\\
250 - Oh, don't remind me.\\
251 - I used to have the perfect get- out-of-relationship-free card.\\
252 - "Oh, I'd love to marry you,\\
253 - "but darn all that prejudice and intolerance.\\
254 - Bite me, Supreme Court."\\
255 - Well, you never know.\\
256 - I didn't expect to find love this late in life,\\
257 - but there's just something about Marty.\\
258 - Yeah, there's just 400 million things about Marty.\\
259 - Yes, but I would love him\\
260 - if he was only worth 200 million.\\
261 - [laughs]\\
262 - You know, I was really touched\\
263 - when you asked me to be your maid of honor.\\
264 - Well, you're the daughter of my only son.\\
265 - Well, what about Alan?\\
266 - Don't spoil my day, dear.\\
267 - And having you with me is like\\
268 - having Charlie around.\\
269 - This will be the only one of my weddings without him.\\
270 - Well, except the first one, of course.\\
271 - Oh, no, dear, he was there.\\
272 - It was the first time we got drunk together.\\
273 -     Men.   \\
274 - Where's Marty?\\
275 - Nobody likes a stripper hog.\\
276 - Oh, speaking of hogs,\\
277 - I once did a show with Miss Piggy.\\
278 - You know there's a guy under there?\\
279 - You know, maybe we should go check on him.\\
280 - MARTY: I'm fine!\\
281 - Best present that I ever had in my whole life.\\
282 - Thank you, Walden.\\
283 - Actually, the strippers were my idea. [chuckles]\\
284 - Oh, well, then you tell your mother\\
285 - the wedding is off.\\
286 - Tell her what?\\
287 - The wedding is off.\\
288 - STEVE: Okay.\\
289 - Wedding pool.\\
290 - I have\\
291 - "Misplaces teeth\\
292 - and can't recite the vows."\\
293 - Uh-huh.\\
294 - I had, uh... [clears throat]\\
295 - "Died during the lap dance."\\
296 - I had "This man's name is Gary.\\
297 - "If found,\\
298 - "take him to 104 North Beverly Drive.\\
299 - Do not give him Scotch."\\
300 - Well, I have... [clears throat]\\
301 - "Alan will screw this up somehow."\\
302 - I win.\\
303 - Are you serious?\\
304 - You can't call off the wedding.\\
305 - You're not thinking clearly.\\
306 - I have never been more clear about anything in my life,\\
307 - except casting Ralph Macchio.\\
308 - Kid was a born star.\\
309 - Well, I think the party is over.\\
310 - Can somebody please drive me to, uh,\\
311 - 104 North Beverly Drive?\\
312 - I gotcha.\\
313 - Listen, maybe on the way home, we can pick up some Scotch.\\
314 - Wait, wait, not so fast!\\
315 - I got a catheter.\\
316 -     Men.   \\
317 -     Men.   \\
318 - I can't believe Marty called off the wedding.\\
319 - I can't believe I left a bachelor party\\
320 - at 4:45 in the afternoon.\\
321 - My mom is gonna be very upset with us.\\
322 - "Us"?\\
323 - You threw the bachelor party.\\
324 - You hired strippers!\\
325 - That's why I said "us."\\
326 - You know what, it ultimately doesn't matter\\
327 - because in your mother's eyes. it's all your fault.\\
328 - [sighs] You're right.\\
329 - She has never forgiven me for her prolapsed vagina.\\
330 - And I'm never gonna forgive you\\
331 - for putting that picture in my head.\\
332 - It's not my fault my ears got caught.\\
333 - She's gonna be crushed, and it's all because of us.\\
334 - Will you stop saying that!\\
335 - It's because of you!\\
336 - First you destroyed her vagina, and now it's her dreams.\\
337 - Really?\\
338 - I thought, as partners, we shared the burdens of life\\
339 - for better or for worse.\\
340 - Or were they just empty vows?\\
341 - We're not married!\\
342 - Oh, you don't have to remind me of that.\\
343 - We're not gay!\\
344 - I can see why we have to tell other people that,\\
345 - but we shouldn't have to tell each other!\\
346 - Oh, hey, Alan, look who's here.\\
347 - Hello, boys.\\
348 - Hey, you want a drink?\\
349 - [both laugh]\\
350 - I know, stupid question.\\
351 - Hey, Mommy, did you have fun shopping?\\
352 - What's wrong?\\
353 - What-what do you mean, "what's wrong"?\\
354 - You're using that same whiny voice\\
355 - you used when you pooped your pants in ballet class.\\
356 - Good Lord.I was a kid!\\
357 - You were 14.\\
358 - You finally had a bulge in your tights,\\
359 - and it was on the wrong side.\\
360 - Okay, you know, I thought this\\
361 - was gonna be difficult, but maybe not.\\
362 - Marty ran off with a couple of strippers.\\
363 - Excuse me?\\
364 - Things got a little crazy at the bachelor party.\\
365 - What happened?\\
366 - Did he eat sugar?\\
367 - He may have.\\
368 - All right.\\
369 - Well, I guess he's having one last little fling\\
370 - before the wedding.\\
371 - Um, y-yeah, about the wedding.\\
372 - There's that same tutu-crapping voice again.\\
373 - He called it off.\\
374 - What?\\
375 - Sorry, Evelyn.\\
376 - But...\\
377 - the strippers have his medication,\\
378 - and I think one of them has a nurse's outfit.\\
379 - You know, I-I think if you went over there and talked to him,\\
380 - you might be able to change his mind.\\
381 - He may have even forgotten he called off the wedding.\\
382 - No, if he doesn't want to get married, that's fine.\\
383 - Are you okay?\\
384 - I mean, is there anything we can do?\\
385 - I'm all right.\\
386 - You can't force someone to love you.\\
387 - Excuse me.\\
388 - [sighs]\\
389 - What did I miss?\\
390 - Well, the wedding's off,\\
391 - and Alan crapped his pants in ballet class.\\
392 -     Men.   \\
393 - Wow.\\
394 - Yeah.\\
395 - If I inherit this place,\\
396 - there's a guest room with your name on it.\\
397 - Man, he bought this with sitcom money.\\
398 - I am in the wrong business.\\
399 - May I help you?\\
400 - Uh, we're here to see Marty.\\
401 - I'm sorry, Mr. Pepper is busy.\\
402 - Really? Uh, he doesn't have time\\
403 - to visit with Ralph Macchio?\\
404 - A thousand apologies, Mr. Macchio.\\
405 - Right this way.\\
406 - After you, Daniel-san.\\
407 -     Men.   \\
408 - We're going to take a bath.\\
409 - You can start washing each other.\\
410 - But save the dirty parts for me.\\
411 - [knocking]\\
412 - Who's there?\\
413 - Uh, it's Alan and Walden.\\
414 - Who?\\
415 - [sighs]\\
416 - Evelyn's gay son and his boyfriend.\\
417 - Oh.\\
418 - All right, come on in.\\
419 - If you're here to change my mind,\\
420 - forget it.\\
421 - But I-I thought you loved my mother.\\
422 - I do,\\
423 - but I'm not ready to settle down.\\
424 - Maybe when I get a little older.\\
425 - Marty, I don't say this unkindly,\\
426 - but if you get any older, you'll be soil.\\
427 - Besides, you know my mother.\\
428 - She'd sleep with you and the strippers.\\
429 - Oh, yeah, she's a big whore.\\
430 - Yeah.\\
431 - I'm not saying she doesn't have her charms.\\
432 - So, what's the problem?\\
433 - The truth is,\\
434 - I'm a six-time loser at marriage,\\
435 - and I don't want to go for a seventh.\\
436 - I get it.\\
437 - You're-you're scared.\\
438 - But, you know, in-in love,\\
439 - you have to take a leap and hope for the best.\\
440 - That should be written on a pillow--\\
441 - the pillow you can bite when you and your buddy are...\\
442 - All right, all right.\\
443 - Um...\\
444 - No, all-all I'm saying is is that marriage\\
445 - can be a beautiful thing.\\
446 - So, why aren't you two married?\\
447 - Yeah.\\
448 - Why aren't we married, Walden?\\
449 - This isn't what you think it is.\\
450 - Right.\\
451 - I don't understand you, but you understand me.\\
452 - You're right.\\
453 - He's right.\\
454 - I-I don't want to\\
455 - end up alone\\
456 - and a-afraid of commitment like Marty.\\
457 - Alan...\\
458 - ...for the last three years of my life,\\
459 - you have...\\
460 - always been there.\\
461 - Every day.\\
462 - When I wake up in the morning, when I go to bed at night,\\
463 - there you are.\\
464 - So, nobody is more surprised\\
465 - to hear this coming out of my mouth than me.\\
466 - This is not happening.\\
467 - Alan Harper...\\
468 - will you marry me?\\
469 - Yes! Yes!\\
470 - A billion times, yes!\\
471 - Okay, okay.\\
472 - All right, okay.\\
473 - Let's save something for the honeymoon.\\
474 - Ibiza, it has to be Ibiza.\\
475 - You're right.\\
476 - Excluding my heart, kidney and liver,\\
477 - I'm not a young man anymore.\\
478 - I'm gonna call your mother.\\
479 - SUGAR: Marty,\\
480 - come find the ducky.\\
481 - [giggling]\\
482 - We-we should probably go break the news to them.\\
483 - Yeah, yeah, that'd probably be the proper thing to do.\\
484 - Just so you know,\\
485 - this is not happening when we're married.\\
486 -     Men.   \\
487 -     Men.   \\
488 - Marty,\\
489 - I love you more than words could ever say.\\
490 - From the moment\\
491 - I took off my blindfold, turned around\\
492 - and saw you behind me for the first time,\\
493 - I knew I'd never need a safe word again.\\
494 - I wish I had one of those right now.\\
495 - Which? The blindfold or the safe word?\\
496 - Yes.\\
497 - Evelyn, I'm so happy you're in my life.\\
498 - When I'm with you, I feel like I'm 85 again.\\
499 - You're the perfect girl for me.\\
500 - You make my heart skip a beat,\\
501 - and you know how to use a defribrillator.\\
502 - [laughter]\\
503 - I wrote that joke.\\
504 - Last night, I only got up one time to pee.\\
505 - I peed a second time, but I-I didn't get up.\\
506 - Ashes to ashes,\\
507 - and dust to dust...\\
508 - Oh, I'm sorry. I skipped a page there.\\
509 - Uh...\\
510 - you may now kiss the bride.\\
511 - Congratulations, Evelyn, on a beautiful ceremony.\\
512 - Yeah. Can't wait for the next one.\\
513 - I just have to tell you,\\
514 - I am a huge fan.Thank you very much.\\
515 - I lost my virginity to one of your records.\\
516 - A-side and B-side, if you know what I mean.\\
517 - [laughs]\\
518 - Oh, I just became a big fan of yours, baby.\\
519 - [laughs]\\
520 - And I just want to say one thing.\\
521 - None of this would've happened without these two.\\
522 - And as my present to you,\\
523 - I've arranged for Tim\\
524 - to perform one more wedding ceremony.\\
525 - [applause]\\
526 - Oh, my God. Oh, my God.\\

\subsection {Episode 14: Three Fingers of Creme De Menthe}
1 - Alan!\\
2 - I have to meet Larry for dinner.\\
3 - Are you ready yet?\\
4 - ALAN: The question is: are you?\\
5 - [muffled]: Happy anniversary, baby.\\
6 - What?\\
7 - Six months ago today,\\
8 - we cheated on Larry for the first time.\\
9 - So, to commemorate the occasion,\\
10 - you donned the traditional balloon underpants?\\
11 - Exactly.\\
12 - I have a "heart-on" for you.\\
13 - Charming.\\
14 - Yeah, I was gonna get you a dozen roses,\\
15 - but I-I thought the balloons were cuter.\\
16 - Cheaper.\\
17 - Six of one, half off the other.\\
18 - I'm not sure this is something we should be celebrating.\\
19 - Come on, you have loved every chapter\\
20 - in our book of forbidden trysts.\\
21 - That magical night in the handicapped stall at Chili's.\\
22 - The time we put a scare into that field trip of sixth graders\\
23 - at the planetarium when they saw Uranus.\\
24 - That weekend that Larry went back east\\
25 - and we went "down south."\\
26 - Alan... I don't have time for this.\\
27 - Well, then open your present.\\
28 - Spoiler alert: it's my penis and two of his friends.\\
29 - And you can't return it if it's the wrong size.\\
30 - As fun as all this is, I only have about ten minutes\\
31 - before I have to go meet Larry, so we got to make this quick.\\
32 - Ooh, my specialty.\\
33 - First, I'm getting rid of these balloons.\\
34 - Oh. Oh.\\
35 - I-I should've had you blow them up.\\
36 - [high-pitched]: I know what you like, baby.\\
37 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
38 -     Ah.        Men.    \\
39 - Hey, bitches.\\
40 - Hey. Hey.\\
41 - What are you guys up to tonight?\\
42 - Oh, dinner and game night.\\
43 - My ex-wife and I used to do that.\\
44 - Our favorite game was Life, until she ruined mine.\\
45 - Yeah, we're more fans of Monopoly, Backgammon...\\
46 - Hungry Hungry Lesbos.\\
47 - It's like Hungry Hungry Hippos, but we don't eat balls.\\
48 - How do you know when you've won that game?\\
49 - Trust me, you know.\\
50 - Hey, something smells good.\\
51 - Yeah, we play that, too.\\
52 - Hey, you guys want to join us for dinner?\\
53 - Oh, no, I can't. I'm going to the movies.\\
54 - Oh, Alan, you want to join?\\
55 - Is it a porn movie?\\
56 - Why would I invite a guy to watch a porn in a theater?\\
57 - So nobody weird sits next to you.\\
58 - Well, going with you wouldn't solve that problem.\\
59 - Fine. Go watch your porn by yourself.\\
60 - I'm not watching a porn!\\
61 - Uh-huh. And I don't use your bathroom to poop.\\
62 - Look, I can't go anyway, 'cause I'm having a drink\\
63 - with my girlfriend's boyfriend.\\
64 - Why don't you poop in his toilet?\\
65 - You're already banging his girlfriend.\\
66 - You got a flat tire.I got a what?\\
67 - I noticed it when I was getting out of your car.\\
68 - Why were you in my car?\\
69 - Taking a nap.\\
70 - Why were you taking a nap in my car?\\
71 - I was getting high, and I just went to sleep.\\
72 - Why were you getting high in my car?!\\
73 - Because you hide your pot in the car!\\
74 - Geez! Which one of us is high, you or me?\\
75 - [groans] Great.\\
76 - Either of you guys got Triple-A?\\
77 - You don't need Triple-A when you got double D's.\\
78 - Why don't you just change it yourself?\\
79 - Eh, sounds like a lot of work.\\
80 - I'll just buy a new car.\\
81 - Or you could use the spare tire and jack.\\
82 - Oh, there's nothing in there.\\
83 - Whoa... there's a trunk under the trunk!\\
84 - Somebody's never smuggled anything out of Mexico.\\
85 - Here, uh, you grab the spare, I'll loosen the lug nuts.\\
86 - Wow, you really know what you're doing.\\
87 - Yeah.\\
88 - Well, I had a boyfriend who was a mechanic.\\
89 - WALDEN and JENNY: A boyfriend?\\
90 - Yeah. Well, I went through a phase where I dated guys.\\
91 - Huh, I thought you were a goldstar.\\
92 - What's a "gold star"?\\
93 - It's a lesbian term for someone who's never been with a guy.\\
94 - Hey, I'm a gold star.\\
95 - Wait a second, what about that story\\
96 - about you skinny-dipping at Boy Scout camp?\\
97 - Well, I was drowning.\\
98 - I had to grab ahold of something.\\
99 - Just happened to be Roger.\\
100 - So, if you had met Walden instead of me...\\
101 - Oh, God, no. [chuckles]\\
102 - Wow, great.\\
103 - I'm getting hypothetical rejections now.\\
104 - I'm sorry, you're just not my type.\\
105 - I was more into, you know, "guy" guys.\\
106 - I'm a "guy" guy.\\
107 - Oh, please.\\
108 - You made me come in your room to kill a spider.\\
109 - I'm allergic!\\
110 - [chuckles]: Look, it's not a big deal.\\
111 - Some guys fix things and some guys\\
112 - call the guys that fix things.\\
113 - You know, right after they watch Project Runway.\\
114 - Oh, I didn't see it last night. Don't tell me, don't tell me.\\
115 - I rest my case.\\
116 - You know what, I'll show you.\\
117 - Here, give me that.\\
118 - Okay.\\
119 - Tell me I'm not a guy's guy.\\
120 - I got "guy" coming out of my ass.\\
121 - Don't... [scoffs] You know what I meant.\\
122 - [groans]\\
123 - God, these nuts are hard to get off.\\
124 - Oh, okay, I'll give you that one. [laughs]\\
125 - Hey, Jeff.\\
126 - Hey, there he is.\\
127 - The B-F-F of J-E-F-F.\\
128 - [both laugh]That's pretty good.\\
129 - Did you just come up with that?\\
130 - What do you think, I just sat here\\
131 - jotting down rhymes before you showed up?\\
132 - I'll have a whiskey.\\
133 - Oh, oh, we're doing the hard stuff. Okay.\\
134 - I'll have three fingers of cr  me de menthe.\\
135 - Yeah, I've just been kind of in a funk lately.\\
136 - What's going on?\\
137 - It's Lyndsey.\\
138 - Mm, Lyndsey. Lyndsey.\\
139 - I'm sorry, uh,\\
140 - Lyndsey is...?My girlfriend.\\
141 - Oh, yes, yes. You know, I-I can never remember her name,\\
142 - because, you know, I never really knew her.\\
143 - Doesn't matter. Anyway, she dumped me.\\
144 - She dumped you?!\\
145 - [laughs]: Oh, my God!\\
146 - Oh, my God.\\
147 - I was so shocked, my first reaction was wrong.\\
148 - Yeah, well, it's been a really rough two weeks.\\
149 - Wait, two weeks?\\
150 - You-you guys have been broken up for two weeks\\
151 - and this is the first I'm hearing about it?\\
152 - Oh, I'm sorry, buddy. I should have told you sooner.\\
153 - Well, someone certainly should have.\\
154 - Anyway, there is one bright side:\\
155 - at least now, you and I are free to hang\\
156 - whenever we want.We couldn't before?\\
157 - Well, I-I didn't really want to tell you this, but...\\
158 - Lyndsey didn't like you very much.\\
159 - She said that?\\
160 - Yeah, she'd go on and on about your hair and your clothes.\\
161 - She even said you had the worst taste in jewelry.\\
162 - I don't know where she got that.\\
163 - I mean, it's not like you ever bought her jewelry.\\
164 - That's true.\\
165 - Although, if I had, she wouldn't have noticed\\
166 - unless I put it in the bottom of her wine glass.\\
167 - Women.\\
168 - I know how to kill this pain.\\
169 - Bring me the bottle.\\
170 - Yeah, better make it two.\\
171 - Ooh, and a little whipped cream.\\
172 - [chuckles]\\
173 - Oh, hey, Berta, can I ask you a question?\\
174 - Yeah.\\
175 - I'm a man's man, right?\\
176 - I thought that when I first met you,\\
177 - but then I found out you were married to a woman.\\
178 - No... no, I mean, like...\\
179 - like, I'm a guy who can...\\
180 - build things and...\\
181 - a guy who can get horses out of mud and...\\
182 - ...who, if-if he gets stabbed, he just rubs dirt in it.\\
183 - You're talking about a guy's guy?\\
184 - One of those dudes, like, in the boner pill commercials?\\
185 - Yeah, exactly.\\
186 - Yeah. You're not one of those.\\
187 - What?\\
188 - Well, you're more like one of those guys\\
189 - that gets a mani-pedi.\\
190 - Yeah, well, first of all,\\
191 - there is nothing wrong with taking care of yourself.\\
192 - And second of all,\\
193 - manicure has the word "man," like, right there in it.\\
194 - Well, now, you calm down manly man,\\
195 - or you're gonna spill your chamomile tea.\\
196 - At least I'm the manliest man in this house, right?\\
197 - Um...\\
198 - What?\\
199 - Really? I'm under Alan?\\
200 - Well, do you want to be on top of him?\\
201 - What did Jenny tell you?\\
202 - I was drowning!\\
203 - 'Sup, ladies?\\
204 - Hey, look who it is: Bob the Builder.\\
205 - Oh, yeah, it's pretty manly, huh?\\
206 - The only thing manlier would be\\
207 - if you were dressed as the cop or the cowboy.\\
208 -     Why... are you gay?    \\
209 - Is this about the flat tire?\\
210 - 'Cause you have nothing to prove.\\
211 - Oh, I ain't provin' nothin'.\\
212 - Just being a guy.\\
213 - Doin' what guys do, fixin' things.\\
214 - And do not expect me\\
215 - to get in touch with my emotions\\
216 - or ask for directions anytime soon.\\
217 - [spits]\\
218 - Is that chewing tobacco?\\
219 - Yes, it is.\\
220 - And it tastes terrible.\\
221 - And I'm feeling dizzy.\\
222 - Wow, very impressive.\\
223 - [laughs]\\
224 - You ain't seen nothing yet.\\
225 - That there's a laser.\\
226 - Badass.\\
227 - Gee, oh, this here table is two degrees from being level.\\
228 - I got this!\\
229 - There we go, job well done.\\
230 - I'm gonna need my band saw.\\
231 - You two clean this up.\\
232 - Ladies' work.\\
233 -     Men.   \\
234 - All right, I'm lubricated.\\
235 - Let's do this thing.\\
236 - So, uh, how was your dinner with Larry the other night?\\
237 - Fine.\\
238 - Where did you go?\\
239 - La Dolce.\\
240 - What did you guys have?Salmon.\\
241 - Did Larry like it?\\
242 - Okay, talking about my boyfriend eating fish\\
243 - is the world's worst foreplay.\\
244 - Is he still eating fish, Lyndsey?\\
245 - Is he?\\
246 - All right, what's going on?\\
247 - I'll tell you what's going on.\\
248 - Larry told me you broke up with him.\\
249 - Mm-hmm. For the love of God,\\
250 - you're still seeing Larry?!\\
251 - As Jeff Strongman?\\
252 - At least one of us is faithful to him.\\
253 - [scoffs]\\
254 - Why didn't you tell me?\\
255 - I didn't tell you because I knew you'd just ask\\
256 - when you and I are getting back together.\\
257 - That's not true.\\
258 - When are we getting back together?\\
259 - Alan.\\
260 - Oh, this is what I've been waiting for\\
261 - for the last six months.\\
262 - We-we can finally be together, honestly, openly.\\
263 - I-I can prove to you\\
264 - I'm the man that you're supposed to be with.\\
265 - I love you, Lyndsey.\\
266 - Great. So you want to get married?\\
267 - Whoa, whoa, marriage? We just got back together.\\
268 - You're just like Larry.\\
269 - Neither one of you are willing to commit.\\
270 - I'm just saying that maybe, you know, we should date a while.\\
271 - I mean, let's be honest, you are a bit of an adulterer.\\
272 - This is why I've been avoiding this conversation.\\
273 - You don't want to get married,\\
274 - and I don't want to be with you unless we do, so...\\
275 - if that's the case, I don't know what else to say, Alan.\\
276 - [sighs]: Except...\\
277 - good-bye.\\
278 - Wow. [laughs]\\
279 - Okay.\\
280 - Okay. I mean...\\
281 - Just so you know, when I walk out this door,\\
282 - I am never coming back.\\
283 - This is the last you will see...\\
284 - of Alan Harper.\\
285 - [door closes]\\
286 - [knocking]\\
287 - Breakup sex?\\
288 - Oh!\\
289 -     Men.   \\
290 - Hello.\\
291 - Oh. Sorry about that. Am I in your way?\\
292 - The only thing in myway are those pants.\\
293 - [chuckles]: Oh, gee, sorry about that.\\
294 - About the only crack around here I ain't put caulk in.\\
295 - [laughs]\\
296 - All right.\\
297 - Whoa! Look at that.\\
298 - Good as new.\\
299 - Hey, if there's anything around here that needs fixin',\\
300 - I'll be the one fixin' it.\\
301 - So if you see something that's broke and bothering you,\\
302 - you just let me know.\\
303 - [sighs]: Hey.\\
304 - I see something that's broke and bothering me.\\
305 - I'm not in the mood, Berta. I just got dumped.\\
306 - Oh. What happened?\\
307 - Well, you know, I confronted Lyndsey\\
308 - about breaking up with Larry, and it blew up in my face.\\
309 - Alan, Alan, Alan.\\
310 - You know, relationships are a lot like woodworking.\\
311 - There's a certain way that things fit together,\\
312 - and if you force it, it splinters and falls apart.\\
313 - But if you take your time, follow instructions,\\
314 - you build something beautiful and solid,\\
315 - something you can be proud of.\\
316 - Like this here elegant cedar birdhouse.\\
317 - What does this have to do with me and Lyndsey?\\
318 - Nothing.\\
319 - But how cool is it I built this?\\
320 - It's even got a guest room for the Alan birds.\\
321 - If you listen real close, you can hear them.\\
322 - Cheap, cheap.\\
323 -        \\
324 - [song ends]\\
325 - Isn't this great?\\
326 - What's cooler than going to a strip club in the daytime?\\
327 - The girls aren't always hot, but the mozzarella sticks are.\\
328 - [groans]: Uh... yeah.\\
329 - You sound like me two weeks ago.\\
330 - I made that noise every time I heard the name "Lyndsey."\\
331 - [groans]\\
332 - Yeah, that's it.\\
333 - What's going on?\\
334 - To be honest, I, uh...\\
335 - had a bit of a breakup myself.\\
336 - Oh, geez. Mm.\\
337 - And here I am whining about myproblems.\\
338 - Eh. I'm sorry, Jeff.\\
339 - If I have a flaw, it's that sometimes\\
340 - I'm not aware of things that are going on around me.\\
341 - It's actually one of the things I like most about you.\\
342 - So, what happened between you and your girl?\\
343 - Well, she wanted to get married,\\
344 - and I'm just not sure I'm ready.\\
345 - No way! That's the same reason I lost Lyndsey.\\
346 - It's like we were dating the same woman.\\
347 - It's exactly like that.\\
348 - So, do you miss her?Are you kidding?\\
349 - I mean, she's the only one for me.\\
350 - I mean, she's the one who brings me up when I'm down...\\
351 - Whoa. Hello, future Mrs. Strongman.\\
352 - So, what are you afraid of?\\
353 - I don't know. It's just such a big commitment.\\
354 - Bottom line: do you still love her?\\
355 - Yes, I do.\\
356 - Then you got to get her back.\\
357 - Don't make the same mistake I did.\\
358 - Yeah, maybe you're right.\\
359 - I know I'm right. Chances like this\\
360 - only come along once in a lifetime.\\
361 - I'm gonna do it, Larry.\\
362 - I am gonna ask her to marry me.\\
363 - That-a-boy! And when things work out,\\
364 - I'm gonna be the best man at you and your girl's wedding.\\
365 - Well... we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.\\
366 - Want a private dance?\\
367 - Oh, sorry, I can't. I have a date with destiny.\\
368 - Destiny's off today.\\
369 - Oh, no, I-I meant, uh, uh... Never mind.\\
370 - Why don't you take my friend. It's on me.\\
371 - Oh, I only have a 20.\\
372 - Uh, you know what?\\
373 - I think seven's fair.\\
374 - [machine buzzing]\\
375 - Walden?\\
376 - Oh, hey!\\
377 - Sorry, ladies!\\
378 - [machine stops]Man at work!\\
379 - Wh-What are you doing?\\
380 - Well, it's a little technical for the layperson.\\
381 - What the hell, let me walk you through it.\\
382 - What I'm doing is sanding and re-staining,\\
383 - when I recognized some dry rot and termite damage.\\
384 - And I thought to myself, what the hell,\\
385 - I got a couple hours--\\
386 - why don't I just rebuild this bad boy from scratch.\\
387 - [giggles]\\
388 - The bubbles tickle my nose.\\
389 - Okay, you know what? You got to stop building things.\\
390 - I was wrong-- you are so manly\\
391 - that if I were straight, I'd totally bang your brains out.\\
392 - Well, of course you would, sweetheart.\\
393 - But I'd probably sleep with you once\\
394 - and then never call you again.\\
395 - Hold still, please.\\
396 - Yep, they're level. [clears throat]\\
397 - [machine starts]Ow!\\
398 - Aah! Aah!\\
399 - Mmm.\\
400 - I'm just gonna rub some dirt in it and keep going.\\
401 - Walden! Hey...\\
402 - What are you doing?\\
403 - Oh, this? Well,\\
404 - it's pretty technical for the layperson.\\
405 - What the hell, let me just...\\
406 - No, doesn't matter, doesn't matter.\\
407 - Uh, I-I got big news.\\
408 - I am gonna ask Lyndsey to marry me.\\
409 - Are you serious?\\
410 - Yeah, I just have to get a ring.\\
411 - I got a ring you could have.\\
412 - The one I proposed to Zoey with.\\
413 - I don't know, that ring didn't work.\\
414 - Neither do you.\\
415 - [chuckles]: Touch  .\\
416 - Well, I can't believe my best friend's getting married.\\
417 - All right, come on, bring it in.\\
418 - Man hug.\\
419 - Oh. Oh. You smell.\\
420 - Oh, yeah. It's awesome, isn't it?\\
421 - I haven't showered in two days.\\
422 - That's what guys do-- we stank.\\
423 - You smell good...\\
424 - bitch.\\
425 - Ladies love flowers.\\
426 - Um...\\
427 - Oh, hey, Jeff!\\
428 - Why are you calling me Jeff?\\
429 - You must be here to see your friend Larry,\\
430 - who is also here.\\
431 - Jeff? What are you doing here?\\
432 - [laughs]: Larry!\\
433 - I-I just, uh, I came by to-to...\\
434 - yell at this one over here\\
435 - for breaking up with my friend Larry.\\
436 - Can you think of a better reason for me to drop by?\\
437 - 'Cause I certainly can't.\\
438 - Well, now that you're here, why don't you have a drink with us.\\
439 - Oh, I-I'm sure Jeff has better places to be.\\
440 - Work, nope. Girlfriend, nope.\\
441 - Taste in jewelry, nope.\\
442 - Here you go.\\
443 - Bottoms up, Lyndsey.\\
444 - Not the first time I've said thatto her.\\
445 - [groans]\\
446 - What's this?\\
447 - A ring?\\
448 - What's going on?\\
449 - Yeah, what isgoing on?\\
450 - Jeff helped me realize I don't want to lose you.\\
451 - These last two weeks\\
452 - have been the worst in my life.\\
453 - I don't want to spend\\
454 - another minute without you.\\
455 - Okay, I think she's heard enough.\\
456 - Let's go get some wings. Come on.\\
457 - Ooh, wings.\\
458 - Just let me wrap this up real quick.\\
459 - Lyndsey MacElroy, you're my soul mate.\\
460 - Will you marry me?\\
461 - I can't believe this is happening.\\
462 - Yes, yes, I will marry you!\\
463 - So, Jeff, how'd it go with yourgirl?\\
464 - Uh...\\
465 - I was too late.\\
466 - She's marrying someone else.\\
467 - That was quick. Wasn't it?\\
468 - I'm sorry.\\
469 - LARRY: You know what? Forget her.\\
470 - If she chose some jackass over you, she's just a dumb whore.\\
471 - Uh, she's-she's actually really great.\\
472 - No, she's not.\\
473 - She and her new man are both garbage.\\
474 - [groans]: Uh...\\
475 -     Men.   \\
476 - Whoa, look at this.\\
477 - That's right.\\
478 - Hey, uh,\\
479 - who has one and a half thumbs\\
480 - and built this deck all by himself?\\
481 - This guy.\\
482 - Well, I'm impressed.\\
483 - I would've had to call a guy.\\
484 - Well, then my phone would've rang,\\
485 - because I amthe guy.\\
486 - Got to admit, I was wrong about you.\\
487 - That's all right. We all make mistakes.\\
488 - Oh! That's my spit cup.\\
489 - This thing feels sturdy enough for us to have sex on later.\\
490 - WALDEN: Oh, it is.\\
491 - But, uh, be careful,\\
492 - 'cause I just stained her.\\
493 - Well, if you hadn't, we would have.\\
494 - Ah. Look at that.\\
495 - Looks like somebody needs a new roof.\\
496 - Luckily, I know a guy. [chuckles]\\
497 - [wood crackling]\\
498 - Whoa. Walden?\\
499 - WALDEN: Call a guy!\\

\subsection {Episode 15: Cab Fare and a Bottle of Penicillin}
1 - Previously on:\\
2 - So, what happened between you and your girl?\\
3 - She wanted to get married, and I'm just not sure I'm ready.\\
4 - That's the same reason I lost Lyndsey.\\
5 - You got to get her back. Don't make the same mistake I did.\\
6 - I am gonna ask Lyndsey to marry me.\\
7 - Yeah, I just have to get a ring.I got a ring you could have.\\
8 - You must be here to see your friend Larry,\\
9 - who is also here.\\
10 - Lyndsey MacElroy, will you marry me?\\
11 - Yes, I will marry you!\\
12 - [Lyndsey laughing]\\
13 - What's going on down here?\\
14 - I got up to pee and I heard moaning.\\
15 - No, you heard crying.\\
16 - [woman moans sensually on TV]\\
17 - And moaning.\\
18 - You're watching porn at 3:00 in the morning?\\
19 - No, it's that soft-core flick\\
20 - that Lyndsey made back in the '90s,\\
21 - Cinnamon's Buns.\\
22 - Nothing brings me back like hearing her fake an orgasm.\\
23 - Oh, listen, I know that breakups are hard, but...\\
24 - Uh, please tell me those were for crying.\\
25 - Oh, yes, yes, uh, yes.\\
26 - Uh, uh, crying, yes, very upset, very upset, yes.\\
27 - Wow, you know, you're a classy guy, Alan.\\
28 - It's hard to understand why she accepted\\
29 - Larry's proposal and not yours.\\
30 - Technically, I never actually proposed.\\
31 - What?Well, when I got there he was already doing it,\\
32 - so I just figured I'd chalk this one up as another loss\\
33 - and move on.\\
34 - Universe: 82,223;\\
35 - Alan: 12.\\
36 - Come on, you're exaggerating.\\
37 - You have not had 12 victories.\\
38 - Yes, I have.\\
39 - Uh, my son, plus the number of years I've lived here rent-free.\\
40 - I can't believe you just stood there\\
41 - while another guy proposed to your girl\\
42 - and you didn't say anything.\\
43 - There's nothing I can do about it.\\
44 - Larry's the one frosting her muffins now.\\
45 - Have we learned nothing from Cinnamon's Buns?\\
46 - She told Master Baker no\\
47 - five times!\\
48 - Did he listen? No!\\
49 - No, the only reason Lyndsey settled for Larry\\
50 - is 'cause she didn't know she could settle for you!\\
51 - You're right. I mean, you're a handsome billionaire,\\
52 - and yousettled for me.\\
53 - She's just a-a-a divorced,\\
54 - middle-aged lush...\\
55 - ...of my dreams.\\
56 - That's the spirit! Now, get up and...\\
57 - wash your hands and...\\
58 - burn this couch, and go get your...\\
59 - surprisingly flexible girlfriend back.\\
60 - You're right, you're right. Thanks, Walden.\\
61 - LYNDSEY [on video]: Oh, Master Baker,\\
62 - would you like to watch while I train this lovely young maiden\\
63 - to churn your butter?\\
64 - Maybe one more scene.\\
65 - This is a pivotal part of the film.\\
66 - You might need this.\\
67 - This scene's a real tear... jerker.\\
68 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
69 -     Ah.         Men.         Men.    \\
70 - Hey, Berta, how about a cup of coffee?\\
71 - No, thanks, I just had a cup.\\
72 - I don't know why you keep her on payroll.\\
73 - Says the guy I pay to be my assistant.\\
74 - Oh, oh, that's still a thing?\\
75 - Oh, oh, cup of joe coming right up, boss.\\
76 - Hey, what are you doing there?\\
77 - I'm making breakfast in bed for Brooke.\\
78 - Hey, what tastes good on boobs?\\
79 - Pineapple rings are always fun.\\
80 - Yeah. You get the room nice and cold, and you play ring toss.\\
81 - Yeah, and with Brooke's bad boys, you could...Hey.\\
82 - Omaha! Omaha!\\
83 - What? Hmm?\\
84 - Nothing. We weren't talking about your boobs.\\
85 - Why not? You stare at 'em enough.\\
86 - [laughs]: What?\\
87 - [laughing]: I don't... I never...\\
88 - I'm sorry.\\
89 - Where are you going?\\
90 - I got to get to work.\\
91 - You can't leave-- breakfast sex\\
92 - is the most important meal of the day.\\
93 - Sorry. Mwa! I'll call you later, okay, babe?\\
94 - No worries.\\
95 - Call me whenever you can. Oh, God, she's dumping me.\\
96 - What are you talking about?\\
97 - Didn't you just hear that?\\
98 - She's "going to work."\\
99 - Okay, I know no one in this house is familiar with it,\\
100 - but "going to work" is an actual thing.\\
101 - It's kind of like "paying rent."\\
102 - It's not just that, it's...\\
103 - it's been forever since we've had sex.\\
104 - Well, how long is forever?\\
105 - Two days!\\
106 - I hate you.\\
107 - Come on, you and Brooke are great together.\\
108 - She's not breaking up with you.\\
109 - Uh, then again, maybe she is slipping away,\\
110 - and you're just gonna have to face the possibility\\
111 - of being alone for the rest of your life.\\
112 - [sobbing gasp]\\
113 - Oh, my God!\\
114 - [Jenny sobbing]\\
115 - What the hell's the matter with you?\\
116 - Why would you say that to her?\\
117 - I'm just trying to prepare her\\
118 - for-for the harsh realities of real life.\\
119 - I mean, who else is gonna do it, her father? He's dead, Walden!\\
120 - Why are you even here? I thought you were\\
121 - gonna go win Lyndsey back.\\
122 - It's early. I want to win her back,\\
123 - but I don't want to spend the whole day with her.\\
124 - [doorbell rings]\\
125 - Alan.\\
126 - Lyndsey MacElroy, I love you.\\
127 - You are my world.\\
128 - I want you to spend the rest of your life with me.\\
129 - And Walden.\\
130 - You're-you're kidding, right?\\
131 - I'm engaged to Larry.\\
132 - That's not fair. I mean, if I hadn't stopped\\
133 - at that gas station to poop, I would have been here first.\\
134 - Alan, don't.\\
135 - Maybe this will change your mind.\\
136 - Oh, Alan, it doesn't matter\\
137 - what kind of ring...\\
138 - Holy crap, that thing's huge!\\
139 - That's what shesaid. [chuckles]\\
140 - I know, not the right time. What do you say?\\
141 - I say I'm marrying Larry.\\
142 - But why?He loves me.\\
143 - Not as much as I do.\\
144 - He has his own house.\\
145 - I...\\
146 - love you.\\
147 - I'm sorry, Alan.\\
148 - You-you really think Larry can make you happier than I can?\\
149 - I think I made the right decision.\\
150 - You made your bed.\\
151 - Now let's have sex in it.\\
152 - Alan.\\
153 - Good-bye.\\
154 - All right.\\
155 - Universe: 82,224.\\
156 - Twenty-five.\\
157 - [sighs]\\
158 - Alan.\\
159 - Hi, Judith.\\
160 - What are you doing here?\\
161 - Oh, God, what did Jake do?\\
162 - Please tell me the Army didn't let him drive a tank again.\\
163 - No, no, nothing's wrong with Jake.\\
164 - Well, nothing newwrong.\\
165 - Then what's going on? Is everything okay?\\
166 - Uh, it's just that I've been having a really rough day,\\
167 - and I needed to see a friendly face.\\
168 - And you picked me?\\
169 - There's that friendly face.\\
170 - I'm sorry. Why don't you come on in.\\
171 - I just opened a bottle of wine.\\
172 - Thanks.Wait.\\
173 - You don't need money, do you?\\
174 - No, not at all.Okay, good.\\
175 - Wait, are you offering?\\
176 - [chuckles]: Whoa, nice blanket.\\
177 - What's with the cat lady starter kit?\\
178 - It's my bad-news blanket.\\
179 - My mom gave it to me when I was a kid.\\
180 - I know what you're saying.\\
181 - I have a bad-news bong.\\
182 - And a good-news bong.\\
183 - And a watching-the-news bong.\\
184 - I guess what I'm saying is, I like to get high.\\
185 - This about Brooke?She blew me off again.\\
186 - She was supposed to come over after work,\\
187 - but she said she was tired.\\
188 - Not having sex with me must be exhausting.\\
189 - Look... Jenny,\\
190 - in any relationship,\\
191 - it's normal for there to be\\
192 - a lull in the bedroom after a while.\\
193 - Does the sex come back?\\
194 - [laughs] You're cute.\\
195 - But it does help if you do romantic stuff.\\
196 - Like what?\\
197 - Surprise her. Be spontaneous.\\
198 - Let her know that you appreciate her.\\
199 - I guess I could send flowers to her work.\\
200 - Ugh! That's so gay.\\
201 - Well, these are the kinds of things we have to do\\
202 - as a relationship evolves.\\
203 - See,\\
204 - sex becomes companionship,\\
205 - and companionship becomes commitment.\\
206 - Commitment... becomes complacency, which...\\
207 - gives way to contempt.\\
208 - Until you find yourself longing for the sweet release of death.\\
209 - Yikes.\\
210 - I'm gonna go get my bad-news bong.\\
211 - [clears throat softly]\\
212 - Oh, my God, oh, my God. Uh, you remember, uh,\\
213 - Jake's seventh grade science project?\\
214 - Wait, which seventh grade?Second time.\\
215 - Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah.\\
216 - Um, he wanted to study\\
217 - how different foods would make his farts smell.\\
218 - Oh, yeah! He'd rip one in Tupperware,\\
219 - seal it and label it.Mm.\\
220 - To this day, I still remember\\
221 - Brussels sprouts. Yes.Oh, Brussels sprouts. Ugh...!\\
222 - Most parents make their kids eat vegetables.\\
223 - We made ours stop.Yeah.Right.\\
224 - And then he got rickets.\\
225 - [both cackling]\\
226 - Oh... oh, it's been a crazy ride, hasn't it?\\
227 - Yeah.Mm.\\
228 - Hey... can I ask you something?\\
229 - Oh, here we go. How much?\\
230 - No, no, not that.\\
231 - What's wrong with me?\\
232 - Oh, Alan. I don't carry around a list of your faults.\\
233 - My therapist said it's no longer healthy.\\
234 - I'm-I'm serious. I mean, it seems like\\
235 - every relationship I've ever been in I've screwed up.\\
236 - Oh. Look, a marriage doesn't fail\\
237 - because of one person screwing up.\\
238 - I screwed up twomarriages.Oh, yeah,\\
239 - yeah, you're right-- you're a two-time loser.\\
240 - Uh, but at least I have Walden; I mean, you've got nobody.\\
241 - Oh, we're being honest now?\\
242 - Herb's penis is bigger than yours.\\
243 - [chuckles] I'd forgotten how good you are at this.\\
244 - Ha-ha...\\
245 - I have missed you.\\
246 - I mean, you know, not the constant verbal abuse\\
247 - that left me a crippled shell of a man.\\
248 - But we could always make each other laugh.\\
249 - Oh. You could never find my G-spot,\\
250 - but you could always find my funny bone.\\
251 - [laughing]: Aw... Oh...\\
252 - I'm just kidding.\\
253 - I've missed you, too.Mm-hmm.\\
254 - Mmm...\\
255 - Oh, yeah, this is, uh...\\
256 - This is probably a bad idea.\\
257 - Definitely. Yeah, yeah.\\
258 - [sniffles]\\
259 - [sighs]\\
260 - Oh.\\
261 - [both moaning]\\
262 - Let's look for that G-spot.\\
263 - Or... how about you look for mine?\\
264 - Mmm. Mmm.\\
265 - Oh, God.\\
266 - What did we do?\\
267 - Mmm.\\
268 - Oh, God, what did Ido?\\
269 -     Men.   \\
270 -     Men.   \\
271 - [grunts quietly]\\
272 - Come on.\\
273 - [sighs] God.\\
274 - [whispering]: What did we do last night?\\
275 - More!\\
276 - Oh, God.\\
277 - [sighs]\\
278 - Oh. Oh.\\
279 - [mutters]\\
280 - [panting]\\
281 - [ringtone plays]\\
282 - Well, well, well, someone never made it home last night.\\
283 - Am I speaking with an engaged man?\\
284 - I think you might be.\\
285 - [laughs] That's great.\\
286 - Hey, what'd Lyndsey say when you showed her the ring?\\
287 - That thing is huge.\\
288 - That's what she said.\\
289 - That's what I said!\\
290 - She also said she's staying with Larry.\\
291 - What? I thought you said you were engaged.\\
292 - I am. To Judith.\\
293 - What, your ex-wife?\\
294 - Whoa. What the hell happened?\\
295 - Well, it's all kind of sketchy.\\
296 - We had a lot to drink.\\
297 - Well, I-I've had a lot to drink before,\\
298 - but I've never got engaged to my ex-wife.\\
299 - Okay, maybe I'm being selfish,\\
300 - but I'd like to talk about me right now.\\
301 - Jyndsey? Hmm?\\
302 - Ludith.\\
303 - Will you Larry me?\\
304 - Let me ask you something.\\
305 - Um, do you think Judith would be more upset,\\
306 - uh, to wake up and find she's engaged to me,\\
307 - or to wake up and find she's missing a finger?\\
308 - Okay, look, I'm sure that she got tipsy\\
309 - and caught up in the moment, too,\\
310 - and if you're just honest with her,\\
311 - she'll probably be relieved.\\
312 - What if she isn't?\\
313 - I mean, how do I get her to want out of marrying me?\\
314 - Be yourself?\\
315 - Worked before.\\
316 - [sighs]\\
317 - Hey, you.\\
318 - Um, uh, listen, uh, we should...\\
319 - we should really talk about last night.\\
320 - Absolutely, but I need to say something first.\\
321 - Things are going to be different this time.\\
322 - I'm not going to make the same mistakes I made before.\\
323 - And I'm going to start by showing you\\
324 - how much I appreciate you every single day.\\
325 - Oh, that's really sweet, but we really should talk about...\\
326 -     Who we should invite to the wedding!    \\
327 - Hey. Hi.\\
328 - Guess what. I'm taking your advice,\\
329 - and I'm surprising Brooke with a romantic evening.\\
330 - Good. You know, I know that's not easy for you.\\
331 - Your dad was the same way.\\
332 - His idea of romance was a warm washcloth,\\
333 - cab fare and a bottle of penicillin.\\
334 - Aw! So my dad wasn't just a drunken, diseased man-whore.\\
335 - He was a gentleman.\\
336 - Charlie would be so happy to see his little girl now.\\
337 - Of course, he'd be even more happy\\
338 - to see the rack on his little girl's girlfriend.\\
339 - Does she have nice boobs?\\
340 - I've never noticed.\\
341 - Hey.\\
342 - Oh, hey.\\
343 - How'd it go with Judith? She take it okay?\\
344 - Uh, well, uh, you know, she... uh, she...\\
345 - It was a... a little hard for her to swallow.\\
346 - Um...\\
347 - Well, I'm just glad you talked to her.\\
348 - Can I get my ring back?\\
349 - Uh, funny story.\\
350 - Um... she kind of kept it,\\
351 - and we're kind of getting married.\\
352 - Alan, I thought you were gonna talk to her.\\
353 - Uh, I did.\\
354 - Uh, we came to an... oral agreement.\\
355 - Oh!\\
356 - Alan!\\
357 - It's my weakness.\\
358 - That and red velvet anything.\\
359 - Wait. Wait.\\
360 - This is the same woman\\
361 - that you said was so evil\\
362 - that her image didn't show up in your wedding pictures.\\
363 - I only said that because, at the time,\\
364 - I thought she was the worst person I'd ever met,\\
365 - and she made my life a living hell.\\
366 - But, you know, people change.\\
367 - It's gonna be great.\\
368 - So, Zippy's moving out, and he's going to be miserable.\\
369 - So you have been listening.\\
370 - Oh.\\
371 - Oh, say,\\
372 - dinner was great, Judith.\\
373 - Thank you for inviting me over.\\
374 - Of course. You're Alan's best friend.\\
375 - Actually, you're Alan's onlyfriend.\\
376 - [laughter]\\
377 - It's funny 'cause it's true.\\
378 - [laughter]\\
379 - Oh, honey, uh, could you pass the potatoes, please?\\
380 - Oh, I think you've already had plenty, doughboy. Mm.\\
381 - [high-pitched]: Ah-ha.\\
382 - [laughs]\\
383 - Well, I have to say,\\
384 - I was shocked when Alan told me you were getting married again.\\
385 - Oh, you were shocked?\\
386 - There was a time when just the thought\\
387 - of being touched by his tiny, clammy hands again\\
388 - made me throw up in my mouth a little.\\
389 - [laughs]\\
390 - That's all ancient history.\\
391 - Yeah, if ancient history was last Thursday.\\
392 - [Judith and Alan laugh]\\
393 - [both making kissing sound]\\
394 - Oh, isn't she great?\\
395 - No!\\
396 - She's treating you like crap.\\
397 - The only people that get to do that\\
398 - are people that do it out of love,\\
399 - like me and Berta and your mom.\\
400 - Okay, fine. Me and Berta.\\
401 - Okay. Me.\\
402 - It's harmless.\\
403 - It's just Judith being funny.\\
404 - Did... did you just twitch?\\
405 - No, I was just talking about how funny Judith is.\\
406 - Okay, look me in the eye\\
407 - and tell me how much you love Judith without twitching.\\
408 - Fine. I love Judith.\\
409 - There, I said it.\\
410 - Alan.\\
411 - You cannot marry this woman.\\
412 - You deserve better.\\
413 - I mean, not much better, but better.\\
414 - You know who I deserve?\\
415 - I deserve Lyndsey, but I can't have her.\\
416 - She's marrying somebody else, so I'm taking what I can get.\\
417 - That's what I do. I'm a love scavenger.\\
418 - You're also a house scavenger and a money scavenger\\
419 - and an underwear scavenger.\\
420 - But that doesn't mean you have to settle.\\
421 - Yes, it does. I don't want to die alone.\\
422 - Maybe you don't realize it, but there aren't a lot of people\\
423 - who want to spend the rest of their lives with me.\\
424 - Oh, no, I realize it!\\
425 - Brooke, really, we can get a hotel for the night.\\
426 - No, no, no, Dad. It's fine.\\
427 - I'll sleep on the couch, and you guys stay in my room.\\
428 - Surprise!\\
429 - Who's this?\\
430 - Uh, Mom, Dad, this is, um...\\
431 - my girlfriend, Jenny.\\
432 - It's a pleasure to meet you!\\
433 - I like her.\\
434 - Oh, hey, I was thinking, now that Jake's gone...\\
435 - Mm?...I can turn his room into my man-cave. You know, a\\
436 - pinball machine, flat-screen TV, potter's wheel.\\
437 - No, that's not going to happen.\\
438 - Oh, you have plans for it?\\
439 - No, I'm just not\\
440 - letting you get another potter's wheel.\\
441 - [laughs]\\
442 - Judith, I have to say,\\
443 - I cannot take my eyes off of that ring.\\
444 - I know. When I first saw it,\\
445 - I thought it was as fake as the orgasms\\
446 - I used to have when we were married.\\
447 - [laughs]\\
448 - That's true.\\
449 - Very unsatisfactory lover.\\
450 - [Judith laughs]\\
451 - JUDITH: But I mean,\\
452 - what woman could say no to this?\\
453 - I can think of one.\\
454 - Can you think of one, Alan?\\
455 - Uh, what's going on?\\
456 - Oh, nothing. I'm just glad\\
457 - that you were there to pick up the pieces\\
458 - after Lyndsey turned down Alan's proposal.\\
459 - What?! You proposed to her before me?\\
460 - Uh, well, technically, uh, what I...\\
461 - Oh, you didn't know?\\
462 - This is awkward.\\
463 - Open mouth, remove pie, insert foot.\\
464 - So, I'm your second choice?!\\
465 - No, d-doesn't matter who was second.\\
466 - Uh, y-you were the first to say yes!\\
467 - I will be the first\\
468 - to say yes to seconds of this pie.\\
469 - You are unbelievable!\\
470 - No, the important thing is\\
471 - that we found each other again.\\
472 - And you're willing to settle for me,\\
473 - and I'm willing to settle for you.\\
474 - Settle for this.\\
475 - Oh! God!\\
476 - I'm a good friend.\\
477 -     Men.   \\
478 - Hey. How's it going?\\
479 - Good. Thanks again for the potter's wheel.\\
480 - It's the least I could do.\\
481 - I cost you a wife.\\
482 - I'm just glad\\
483 - you, uh, came to your senses.\\
484 - Yeah, I was just scared.\\
485 - Didn't want to spend the rest of my life alone.\\
486 - Hey, as long as I'm around, you'll never be alone.\\
487 - Ah, thanks, buddy.\\
488 - Oh, shoot. Aah!\\

26 - and a great bottle of French wine.\\
27 - Uh, uh, technically it's French Canadian.\\
28 - Uh, it's called "Two-buck Canuck,"\\
29 - and, uh, it's not wine, it's wine-ish.\\
30 - Um, but it still gets the panties on the floor,\\
31 - if you know what I'm talking about.\\
32 - [laughter]\\
33 - Maybe you should have another glass, Lyndsey.\\
34 - I'm good.\\
35 - Hey, uh, how about you, Larry?\\
36 - No, I'm not wearing panties.\\
37 - All righty, so, uh, guess we're done with this.\\

39 - how long of an engagement are you guys planning?\\
40 - Uh, two years? Five years?\\
41 - I mean, you know, there's no rush to start a family.\\
42 - I mean, after all, uh,\\
43 - Lyndsey's well beyond her child-bearing age.\\
44 - Well, we have talked about adopting a baby from China.\\
45 - Oh!Course, then we'd have to teach it English,\\
46 - which seems like a lot of work.\\
47 - Would you mind getting desert, sweetie?\\
48 - Sure. Sure.\\
49 - Um, kidding.\\
50 - Uh, this one's on you, sweetie.\\
51 - [Alan & Larry laughing]\\
52 - All right, but no funny business while I'm gone.\\
53 - I'll know, Jeff.\\
54 - [laughs] You haven't so far.\\
55 - I've been banging this one for months.\\

58 - She does too! [laughing]\\
59 - [laughing]\\
60 - Isn't this fun?\\
61 - [laughing]: Yeah. It's great.\\
62 - Why the hell are you here?\\
63 - Larry asked me to dinner.\\
64 - What was I supposed to say?\\
65 - That you couldn't come. That you had to work.\\
66 - That you're not really Jeff Strongman\\
67 - and your entire friendship is a lie.\\
68 - That I had to work-- that's a good one.\\
69 - [sighs]\\
70 - Alan, this wedding is very important to me.\\
71 - If you still have any feelings for me at all,\\
72 - you will let me have this day.\\
73 - Fine.\\
74 - I shan't go.\\
75 - [sighs]\\
76 - But good luck getting the Chicken Dance\\
77 - started without me.\\
78 - Hey, Jeff, you want a piece of Lyndsey's pie?\\
79 - There's no way I can eat it all myself.\\
80 - I don't know.\\
81 - Last time I had some, there was a hair in it.\\
82 - Jeff was actually just saying that he's got to get going.\\
83 - Mm.Really? Oh.\\
84 - Well, then I'll make this quick.\\
85 - I know we haven't known each other for a long time,\\
86 - but I feel like we share a lot.\\
87 - M-More than you know.\\
88 - So I was wondering if you'd do me the honor\\
89 - of being my best man?\\
90 - What?! What?!\\
91 - What do you say?\\
92 - I... say...\\
93 - ...you've made me the happiest\\
94 - person in the world-- yes!\\
95 - [laughing]\\
96 - You sure? Don't you want to take a moment to think about it?\\
97 - What is there to think about?\\
98 - You know, you could change my name from\\
99 - "Jeff Strongman", to "Jeff Best Man."\\
100 - [both laughing]\\
101 - That's the kind of stuff I want in your toast!\\
102 - And this is the kind of stuff\\
103 - you're gonna get on the dance floor:\\
104 - [singing "Chicken Dance" melody]\\
105 - [both grunting in rhythm]\\
106 - [both laughing]\\
107 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
108 -     Ah.        Men.    \\
109 -     Men.   \\
110 - Oh. Oh. Wait.\\
111 - FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE: Hey, good lookin'.\\
112 - Whatcha got cookin'?\\
113 - Pot brownies.\\
114 - What the hell is that?\\
115 - FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE: It's a new project\\
116 - I'm working on.\\
117 - It enables a computer\\
118 - to read my mind\\
119 - and then talk to you.\\
120 - Why can't you just talk to me?\\
121 - FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE: Because, I...\\
122 - and this... shut up.\\
123 - Come on, try it. I think it's big enough.\\
124 - I think it'll fit.\\
125 - The last time someone said that,\\
126 - I ended up pregnant with my first daughter.\\
127 - Hey... I got good news.\\
128 - I'm paid to pick up your crap, not listen to it.\\
129 - Guess who Larry asked to be his best man?\\
130 - One of his friends who's actually real?\\
131 - Jeff Strongman is like butter on movie theater popcorn.\\
132 - He may not be real, but he's delicious nonetheless.\\
133 - Okay, so, let me get this straight:\\
134 - your alter ego,Mm-hmm.\\
135 - is going to be the best man\\
136 - at the wedding of your lover...\\
137 - and another guy?\\
138 - When you put it like that, it sounds like\\
139 - a soap opera on Telemundo.\\
140 - [doorbell rings]\\
141 - [Spanish accent]: Se  or Strongman, why do you\\
142 - make love to the woman of the man you love?\\
143 - Lyndsey?Are you insane?\\
144 - Oh, si, Se  or Strongman es muy loco.\\
145 - How could you say "yes", to being Larry's best man?\\
146 - I don't know. I got excited.\\
147 - And you and I both know when I get excited, I tend to...\\
148 - react prematurely.\\
149 - Why would you even want to go?\\
150 - Are you kidding me?!\\
151 - I mean, just 'cause you're mad at me right now\\
152 - doesn't mean I'm going to miss the wedding of someone I love.\\
153 - Aw... that's very sweet.\\
154 - I was talking about Larry.\\
155 - Oh! Ow!\\
156 - Ah! Dios m  o!\\
157 - Alan, I don't care how you do it,\\
158 - fake Jeff Strongman's death--\\
159 - actually die.\\
160 - You will not be at my wedding.\\
161 - [door slams shut]\\
162 - [scoffs, laughs]\\
163 - She will be back here in three seconds looking for make-up sex.\\
164 - One...\\
165 - Two...\\
166 - FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE: Three.\\
167 - Three.\\
168 - You're an idiot.\\
169 - I'm, um, I'm sorry.\\
170 - That was wrong.\\
171 - T   eres una idiota.\\
172 -     Men.   \\
173 - All right, Bill Gates...\\
174 - Steve Wozniak...\\
175 - and Mark Zuckerberg.\\
176 - Ooh, that's a tough one.Yeah.\\
177 - I'd definitely kill Mark Zuckerberg...\\
178 - ...bang Bill Gates, marry Steve Wozniak.\\
179 - What?! That's crazy.\\
180 - I mean, yes, you have to kill Zuckerberg.\\
181 - But you gotta marry Bill.\\
182 - I mean, I've seen it before,\\
183 - he is gonna take those glasses off\\
184 - and shake is hair loose and you're gonna be like,\\
185 - "Where did this guy come from?"\\
186 - I hear you, but I'm still marrying Woz.\\
187 - I'm a boob man.\\
188 - Are you guys playing "Bang, Marry, Kill" again?\\
189 - 'Cause if you are, I've got one for you:\\
190 - Angelina Jolie, Mila Kunis and me.\\
191 - I would kill you\\
192 - by banging you to death on our honeymoon.\\
193 - Aw...[laughs]\\
194 - And then after the funeral, Angelina Jolie.\\
195 - I would love to bang Mila Kunis.\\
196 - Not gonna happen, Barry.\\
197 - All right. I'm out of here.\\
198 - I thought we were gonna grab some dinner.\\
199 - I can't. I got a thing.\\
200 - You got a thing. I got a thing.\\
201 - We put our things together, we have some fun.\\
202 - Hey, every time I say stuff like that,\\
203 - I get pepper sprayed.\\
204 - That was one time, Barry and my mom still feels bad about it.\\
205 - I'll make it up to you tomorrow, I promise.\\
206 - What's your mom up to these days?\\
207 - Shut up, Barry.\\
208 - Better hope I don't run into Mila Kunis.\\
209 - [scoffs] Yeah, like that's gonna happen.\\
210 -     Men.   [doorbell rings]\\
211 - Hey! There's my best man!\\
212 - Groom goes the dynamite.\\
213 - [imitates explosion]\\
214 - [laughing]Come on in.\\
215 - I've got some beer on ice and sports on ice.\\
216 - Oh, yeah! You're right!\\
217 - Uh, tonight's the finals of the pairs ice dancing.\\
218 - [laughing]\\
219 - You're hilarious.\\
220 - Hey, you got to do this gay character\\
221 - in your best man toast.\\
222 - Uh, about that, you know I'm-I'm-I'm not sure\\
223 - that I'm the right person to be your best man.\\
224 - I'll probably just end up drinking too much\\
225 - and getting yelled at by the bride\\
226 - and singing a tearful, yet moving version of\\
227 - "All by Myself."\\
228 - At least, that's what happened at my wedding.\\
229 - Well, you're not getting cold feet, are you, buddy?\\
230 - Well, no, it's just that it's your special day.\\
231 - I mean, y-you sure that there isn't somebody more deserving\\
232 - to be your best man?\\
233 - A-a-a brother? A college roommate?\\
234 - Someone who knows your last name?\\
235 - God, you're a riot.\\
236 - There's nobody I'd rather stand with\\
237 - at that altar than you, Jeff.\\
238 - [sighs] Why do you have to be so darn sweet?\\
239 - Plus, I'm counting on you to help me out\\
240 - with the most important part of this wedding--\\
241 - bachelor party.Outfits.\\
242 - I was thinking black tie.\\
243 - Sure, black girls, Thai girls, whatever you want.\\
244 - Larry, where can I put this poop?\\
245 - Ooh! And who do we have here?\\
246 - This is my sister Gretchen. She just moved here.\\
247 - Gretchen, this is Jeff Strongman.\\
248 - Oh, yeah!\\
249 - Hey, from what I hear,\\
250 - I should call you "Jeff Best Man."\\
251 - [whispering]: Oh, my God, that's what I said.\\
252 - Um, so, where's your dog?\\
253 - In the garage trying to wipe his ass.\\
254 - Now, I couldn't find the trash.\\
255 - It's out back. I got it.\\
256 - [laughs]You can tell I love her,\\
257 - 'cause I take a lot of crap from her.\\
258 - Get it? Crap.\\
259 - [laughing]\\
260 - And he's Mom's favorite.\\
261 - I hear you. Luckily, my brother's dead.\\
262 - Oh. So...\\
263 - uh... uh, you just moved here?\\
264 - Yeah. My brother's letting me crash here.\\
265 - I told him it was just for a couple days,\\
266 - but, between you and me, it's a pretty sweet deal.\\
267 - Huh. I should try that.\\
268 - Part of me thinks\\
269 - I should just stay here till he dies.\\
270 - Why stop there?\\
271 - Why not move in with the next guy who buys the house?\\
272 - Yeah.\\
273 - So, uh, what do you do?\\
274 - I'm a vet. I moved out here\\
275 - to run an animal shelter.\\
276 - Oh... so that tasteful sports bra\\
277 - covers a tender heart?\\
278 - Well, the puppies at the shelter\\
279 - aren't the only ones that need support.\\
280 - Well, I'd uh, I'd love to meet your furry little friend.\\
281 - Oh.\\
282 - I mean, I'm talking about the dog.\\
283 - Um...\\
284 - Not that I don't want to meet--\\
285 - Never mind, uh...[laughs]\\
286 - So, you run a shelter?\\
287 - Yeah. I've always had a soft spot for strays\\
288 - that no one else wanted to take in.\\
289 - [whimpers like a puppy]\\
290 -     Men.   \\
291 - Hey.Ho, ho, ho-- somebody is gettin' laid tonight.\\
292 - Thank you.\\
293 - No, not you.\\
294 - I just found a late night booty call on Craigslist.\\
295 - Hello, BoobaFett420.\\
296 - You know, Barry,\\
297 - sometimes the picture isn't who you get.\\
298 - Oh, tell me about it.\\
299 - I used your picture.\\
300 - Where's Nicole?\\
301 - Ugh. Nicole.\\
302 - Yikes.\\
303 - This is gonna be tough.What happened?\\
304 - She's dead.What?\\
305 - No, she just blew you off again.\\
306 - I was just trying to soften the blow.\\
307 - The second time she canceled.\\
308 - Something's going on.\\
309 - Look, I'm sure there is\\
310 - a perfectly reasonable explanation.\\
311 - She say anything?\\
312 - Just that she would call you later.\\
313 - But on the plus side, I'm available now.\\
314 - Dave and Buster's, party of two.\\
315 - We're not going to Dave and Buster's.\\
316 - We're gonna track down my girlfriend.\\
317 - Now shut up and get in the car.\\
318 - Oh, my God, you sound just like my dad.\\
319 -     Men.   \\
320 - This is impressive.\\
321 - How'd you track her down at the restaurant?\\
322 - GPS? Triangulate the cell phone signal?\\
323 - No, she asked me to make the reservations for her.\\
324 - [sighs]\\
325 - Look at her in there.\\
326 - Happy as can be.\\
327 - [feminine voice]: I'll have an order of seared Walden's Heart.\\
328 - Hold the trust and honesty.\\
329 - [chuckling]: Okay, okay, let me try one.\\
330 - You know, honey, I'm worried about Bobby.\\
331 - His grades have really been slipping.\\
332 - Who are you doing?\\
333 - That serious-looking couple in the corner.\\
334 - [feminine voice]: Well, I'm worried about the fact\\
335 - that you always have to drive the baby-sitter home.\\
336 - I'm just doing Nicole.\\
337 - Well, somebody's doing Nicole, but it's clearly not you.\\
338 - [sighs]\\
339 - Why does this always happen to me?\\
340 - Boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl,\\
341 - girl breaks boy's heart,\\
342 - boy ends up in car with socially awkward friend.\\
343 - Come on, man. You know chicks.\\
344 - She's probably just playing hard to get.\\
345 - "You can't just show up at my house like this, Barry."\\
346 - "Where'd you get those pictures, Barry?"\\
347 - "Stop washing my car in jean shorts, Barry."\\
348 - D-Do you have to notify people\\
349 - when you move into a new neighborhood?\\
350 - Oh... [scoffs]\\
351 - Who's that guy?\\
352 - A waiter?\\
353 - Yeah. A waiter who likes to hug.\\
354 - Oh! Maybe it's Bobby, the son of the serious couple.\\
355 - Will you stop that?\\
356 - Hey, don't yell at me. I'm not the one cheating on you.\\
357 - You know, new rule: no more talking.\\
358 - [feminine voice]: You know, honey, I'm worried about the way\\
359 - the man in that car is treating his friend.\\
360 -     Men.   \\
361 -     Men.   \\
362 - Hey.\\
363 - What you doing?\\
364 - Filling out an application.\\
365 - You're getting a job?\\
366 - No, I'm getting a medical marijuana card.\\
367 - "What is your medical condition?"\\
368 - Stress.\\
369 - Brought on...\\
370 - by lack of marijuana.\\
371 - Hey, can I... can I run something by you?\\
372 - I think Nicole's cheating on me.\\
373 - Why do you think that?\\
374 - I followed her\\
375 - and I saw her with another guy.\\
376 - That can mean a lot of things.\\
377 - Well-well, we were supposed to go out\\
378 - and then she canceled last minute\\
379 - and then she lied to me about where she was going.\\
380 - Bitch be cheatin'.\\
381 - Guess who's dating someone new.\\
382 - His girlfriend.\\
383 - Really? That sucks.\\
384 - Her name is Gretchen, and she's amazing.\\
385 - Is this the beginning of the end\\
386 - of the whole Jeff Strongman thing?\\
387 - Uh, au contraire, uh, she's actually dating Jeff Strongman.\\
388 - She's Larry's sister.\\
389 - Uh, oh, and, uh, I'm still the best man in Lyndsey's wedding.\\
390 - Standard best man stuff:\\
391 - Throw a bachelor party, give a toast at the wedding,\\
392 - assume a false identity\\
393 - and bang both the bride and the sister of the groom.\\
394 - Wow. When you put it that way,\\
395 - it sounds like a soap opera on Telemundo.\\
396 - That's what I said!\\
397 - What does Lyndsey think of all this?\\
398 - I don't know. Um, Alan hasn't told her\\
399 - and Jeff Strongman doesn't care.\\
400 - How is it that Se  or Strongman\\
401 - has two girls and I have none?\\
402 - Because you're not willing to lie\\
403 - and treat women like crap so you can get laid.\\
404 - You're a romantic.\\
405 - You think every girl you meet is your soul mate.\\
406 - You're ready to move in after the first date.\\
407 - We have a term for guys like you\\
408 - in the lesbian community.\\
409 - It's "lesbian."\\
410 -     Men.   \\
411 - Hey. How you doing?\\
412 - Great.\\
413 - I didn't sleep at all last night.\\
414 - I just kept thinking about Nicole and that guy.\\
415 - I found my first gray hair.\\
416 - Not on my head.\\
417 - Yeah. I didn't sleep much, either.\\
418 - I met up with BoobaFett420.\\
419 - Turned out the "420" was in reference to her weight.\\
420 - NICOLE: Hey.\\
421 - Look who it is.\\
422 - I'm really sorry about last night,\\
423 - but there's something I want to talk to you about.\\
424 - Is it your pants?\\
425 - 'Cause they're on fire.\\
426 - 'Cause you're a liar.What?\\
427 - We saw you at the restaurant with a guy last night.\\
428 - You followed me?\\
429 - No, actually, we followed a really handsome guy\\
430 - who you had dinner with and just happened to run into you.\\
431 - I wanted to go to Dave and Buster's.\\
432 - All right.\\
433 - Okay, I was waiting for a better time\\
434 - to tell you this, but the guy I had dinner with last night\\
435 - works for Google.\\
436 - Oh... W... Get...\\
437 - Barry, Google "betrayal" and...\\
438 - Oh, actually, Bing "betrayal" and let's see what comes up.\\
439 - [Barry types rapidly]\\
440 - Yep. Picture of Nicole.\\
441 - I didn't really Google it.\\
442 - That's my screen saver.\\
443 - It's not what you think.\\
444 - He offered me a job in San Francisco.\\
445 - They're working on the same technology that we are,\\
446 - and he said that I could pick my own team and that's you guys.\\
447 - Oh, my God.\\
448 - NICOLE: Yeah.\\
449 - I've never been picked for a team.\\
450 - And you're gonna do this?\\
451 - We are so close.\\
452 - Well, they're a lot closer.\\
453 - Wow. I mean, the chances of us beating Google are one in a...\\
454 - googol.\\
455 - I bet we'll get to make jokes like that\\
456 - all the time at Google.\\
457 - Who cares if they beat us?\\
458 - We'll create something else.\\
459 - All we have to do is\\
460 - believe in ourselves and we can change the world.\\
461 - Now, they're giving you an opportunity to work for Google.\\
462 - I'm giving you an opportunity to beGoogle.\\
463 - I have to take this. I'm sorry.\\
464 - So you're just going to San Francisco?\\
465 - Where does that leave us?\\
466 - Well, I mean, we were... we were just having fun, right?\\
467 - Yeah, fun. Okay.\\
468 - Good. I'm just... I just... [clears throat]\\
469 - I'm glad you're not one of those people who thinks\\
470 - every person they meet is their soul mate. Or...\\
471 - that-that you would think that we were moving in\\
472 - with each other just 'cause we had sex.\\
473 - She's not a lesbian, dude.\\
474 - I gotta call the guy back.\\
475 - Go ahead.\\
476 - Good luck in San Francisco.\\
477 - Thanks.\\
478 - All right.\\
479 - I'm sorry, buddy.\\
480 - I'm here for you.\\
481 - Appreciate that.\\
482 - You know, actually...\\
483 - what she's offering is a pretty good deal, so...\\
484 - if you wanted to go with her...\\
485 - Oh, thank God.\\
486 -     Men.   \\
487 - So tell me about Gretchen.\\
488 - Well, um, there isn't much to tell.\\
489 - I, um... I grew up in Chicago,\\
490 - I went to Northwestern, became a veterinarian,Mmm.\\
491 - married the man of my dreams but apparently he was dreaming\\
492 - of banging my best friend, so...\\
493 - How 'bout you?\\
494 - Uh, I haven't met your best friend.\\
495 - Is she hot?\\
496 - You know I neuter dogs for a living.\\
497 - Are you threatening or offering?\\
498 - [chuckles]\\
499 - So-so, uh, what brought you to L.A.?\\
500 - Uh, just looking for a fresh start.\\
501 - You know? I mean, out here, I can be whoever I want to be.\\
502 - I can reinvent myself.\\
503 - Mm. I thought about doing that.\\
504 - But in the end, I can't be anyone but Jeff Strongman.\\
505 - Well, I wouldn't mind a strong man in the end.\\
506 - Ooh, dirty word play.\\
507 - I'm vibrating.\\
508 - I'm growing.\\
509 - No, uh...\\
510 - no, our-our table's ready.\\
511 - Oh, great, great. Uh, well,\\
512 - let's take our wine and have a seat.Yeah, or, um,\\
513 - you know, there's 20 minutes left in happy hour.\\
514 - I mean, we could just stay here and fill up\\
515 - on two-for-one appetizers and half-off drinks.\\
516 - Yes!\\
517 - I mean, you know, if that's what you want.\\
518 - It's just... I hate spending money unnecessarily.\\
519 - Anything we don't finish is going home with us.\\
520 - I tell 'em it's for the dogs, but...\\
521 - woof.\\
522 - Gretchen...\\
523 - do you believe in love at first sight?\\
524 -     Men.   \\
525 -     Men.   \\
526 - [spits]\\
527 - [coughs]\\
528 - What the hell is "wine-ish"?\\
529 - Hey.\\
530 - Hey.\\
531 - How was the date?\\
532 - Best... date... ever.\\
533 - [chuckles] We are perfect for each other.\\
534 - It's like... it's like God cloned me\\
535 - and gave me boobs and a vagina.\\
536 - Alan, can't you see that this Jeff Strongman stuff\\
537 - is only gonna cause you problems?\\
538 - Actually, I'm starting to think Alan Harper is the problem.\\
539 - I mean, Jeff Strongman has a girlfriend, a best friend\\
540 - and he's practically debt-free.\\
541 - Practically?\\
542 - He may have received a free credit card offer\\
543 - that was a little too good to pass up.\\
544 - Jeff Strongman has a credit card?\\
545 - And get this, Alan Harper got 100 bucks for referring Jeff.\\
546 - Now I just need to figure out a way to get rid of Alan Harper.\\
547 - It's not as easy as you think!\\
548 - [doorbell rings]\\
549 - Barry.\\
550 - I thought about what you said\\
551 - and I decided...\\
552 - I want to stay and work with you.\\
553 - I mean, I don't want to work for Google.\\
554 - I want to beGoogle.\\
555 - Really? Yeah.\\
556 - I want to change the world.\\
557 - [chuckles] Hey.\\
558 - We're gonna do great things together.\\
559 - Hell, yeah, we are.\\
560 - All right.\\
561 - So where do I sleep?\\

1 - Previously onTwo and a Half Men...I am gonna ask Lyndsey\\

5 - I was wondering if you'd do me the honor of being my best man.\\
6 - What? What?\\
7 - Larry, where can I put this poop?\\
8 - This is my sister Gretchen. She just moved here.\\
9 - Gretchen, this is Jeff Strongman.\\
10 - I think the computer just read his thoughts.\\
11 - [squealing][laughs]\\
12 - Yes!\\
13 - The guy I had dinner with last night offered me\\
14 - a job in San Francisco.\\
15 - Where does that leave us?\\

30 - Oh, hey.\\
31 - Jake?\\
32 - Barry.\\
33 - Did you break into this house and kill Walden?\\
34 - 'Cause if you did, just know...\\
35 - I'm one hell of a roommate.\\
36 - No, I'm a friend of Walden's.\\
37 - I'm gonna be crashing here for a few days.\\
38 - Actually, Walden would probably say I'm his best friend.\\
39 - Oh, really?\\
40 - 'Cause I have a picture of us at Splash Mountain\\
41 - that refutes that statement.\\
42 - What's that you're cooking?\\
43 - Cinnamon French toast; Walden's favorite.\\
44 - Walden's allergic to cinnamon.\\
45 - No, Walden is allergic to nutmeg.\\
46 - Touch  .\\
47 - What's his birthday, favorite color and worst fear?\\
48 - July 12, forest green, dying in your arms.\\
49 - Coffee? Cream, two Splendas?\\
50 - Wait, y-you know what I like, too?\\
51 - I know a lot of things.\\
52 - I know that you're sleeping with Lyndsey,\\
53 - who is engaged to Larry,\\
54 - who thinks you're Jeff Strongman,\\
55 - and you just went on a date with Gretchen, Larry's sister.\\
56 - And your worst fear is not dying in this house.\\
57 - [gasps] Witch.\\
58 - Get out of my head.\\
59 - Something smells good.\\
60 - That is the cinnamon French tatas.\\
61 - Hey, you-you must be Jake.\\
62 - Give your cousin Jenny a hug.\\
63 - That's not Jake.Shut up, Dad.\\
64 - Morning!\\
65 - Hey, Berta.\\
66 - Welcome home, Jake.\\
67 - That's not Jake.\\
68 - That's Walden's friend Barry.\\
69 - Uh, Berta,\\
70 - making a special batch of French toast for you\\
71 - topped with a dollop of marijuana butter.\\
72 - I like "Not Jake."\\
73 - All right, who wants the first batch?\\
74 - [others clamoring]\\
75 - Aw, hell, no.\\
76 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
77 -     Ah.         Men.         Men.    \\
78 -     Men.   \\
79 - Hey.\\
80 - Extra! Extra!\\
81 - Alan boards the Titanic!\\
82 - Read all about it!\\
83 - You're just jealous.\\
84 - Jealous of what? Your up-and-coming role\\
85 - in the Newsiesremake?\\
86 - I will have you know that the salesgirl at Goodwill said\\
87 - that I look dashing.\\
88 - Why are you wearing this outfit?\\
89 - I'm going out with Gretchen again tonight.\\
90 - As her date or her caddie?\\
91 - Oh, that reminds me-- I gotta get a cover for my wood.\\
92 - Why are you going out with her again?\\
93 - What do you mean? I like her, she likes me--\\
94 - honestly, I can see myself spending the rest\\
95 - of Jeff Strongman's life with her.\\
96 - Okay, unlike Jeff Strongman,\\
97 - she is a real person.\\
98 - With real feelings.\\
99 - And real... [grunts]\\
100 - I know, I know. I... I don't want to hurt her.\\
101 - If that's the case, then you need to walk away.\\
102 - I-I will, I will. You're right.\\
103 - Right after I have sex with her.\\
104 - No!\\
105 - Well, I'm not gonna walk away whileI'm having sex with her.\\
106 - That would be rude.\\
107 - Hey, Jeff Strongman looks good in that hat.\\
108 - Top of the day to you, too, sir.\\
109 - Wait, you can tell when he's not Alan?\\
110 - Oh, yeah. I mean, Jeff exudes a quiet confidence,\\
111 - whereas Alan just...\\
112 - exudes.\\
113 - Is there a shower I can use? Uh, oh, yeah.\\
114 - Uh, Alan's room's down the hall on the left.Whoa, whoa, whoa,\\
115 - whoa, whoa. What about Jenny's?\\
116 - She's in there with Brooke.\\
117 - Yeah, I don't think I can go in there again "by accident."\\
118 - But-but, uh, wh-what about your bathroom?\\
119 - They're all my bathrooms!\\
120 - Alan's shower.\\
121 - Great.\\
122 - Uh...\\
123 - so, is this a "pee in the shower"\\
124 - or "not pee in the shower" household?\\
125 - "Not pee in the shower."\\
126 - So it's a "pee in the shower and lie about it" household.\\
127 - And don't touch my shower porn!\\
128 - That stuff took a long time to laminate.\\
129 - Everything... you... say... is... weird.\\
130 - Look, look, I know you're upset about Barry moving in with us,\\
131 - but hitting me with a 25-cent hat\\
132 - is not gonna solve anything.\\
133 - He's not moving in.\\
134 - He's just staying here for a couple days\\
135 - while we brainstorm some new tech ideas.\\
136 - Oh, Walden, you're such a pushover.\\
137 - Somebody else said they were only gonna stay in the house\\
138 - for a few days. Remember that?\\
139 - Oh, believe me, I remember.\\
140 - And now, here we are, four months later,\\
141 - and Jenny's still living with us.\\
142 - Why... can't... you... hear... yourself?\\
143 -     Men.   \\
144 -     Summer lovin', had me a blast    \\
145 -     Summer lovin'    \\
146 -     Happened so fa-ast    \\
147 -     I met a girl crazy for me    \\
148 -     Met a boy cute as can be    \\
149 - Maybe we should start again.\\
150 - Why, was I pitchy?\\
151 - You are so adorable.\\
152 - Oh, and you have broccoli in your teeth.\\
153 - Oh... [chuckles] You want to get it for me?\\
154 - Ooh, a kiss and a free meal.\\
155 - Mmm...!\\
156 - Yum. [chuckles]\\
157 - I've never had broccoli and tongue before.\\
158 - I gotta say, I love that hat on you.\\
159 - Oh!You know, it's funny, I gave one just like that to Goodwill.\\
160 - Yeah, yeah, this is the same one.\\
161 - [both laugh]Well, uh,\\
162 - thanks again for dinner tonight.\\
163 - Oh, yeah.\\
164 - Next one's on you, though.\\
165 - Absolutely. Um, speaking of which,\\
166 - I'm not sure we should keep seeing each other.\\
167 - What? We don't have to go somewhere expensive.\\
168 - Oh, God, you're making this so hard.\\
169 - That's what he said!\\
170 - Oh, peas, pod.\\
171 - No, it's... [sighs] it's just, you know,\\
172 - I'm Larry's best man and you're his sister.\\
173 - I mean, what if things go wrong and we screw up the wedding?\\
174 - Look, I like you\\
175 - and I think you like me,\\
176 - and if it'll make you more comfortable,\\
177 - we can keep it a secret for now.\\
178 - I mean, if you're good at keeping secrets.\\
179 - I don't know.\\
180 - "Strongman" in German means "honest man."\\
181 - Is that true?\\
182 - Jawohl.\\
183 - But I suppose we could keep it...\\
184 - [German accent]: under ze radar.\\
185 - Great. Hmm...\\
186 - So you know, uh...\\
187 - Larry and Lyndsey are in Palm Springs for the weekend.\\
188 - They are? Yeah.\\
189 - You want to... come inside?\\
190 - BOTH: That's what she said!\\
191 - [laughing]\\
192 -     Men.   \\
193 - [sirens wailing on TV]This is awesome.\\
194 - [laughing]\\
195 - These are the best graphics I've ever seen.\\
196 - [laughs] Uh-oh!\\
197 - The cops shot my tires out.\\
198 - Now I'm runnin'.\\
199 - Oh... Wait, this isn't a video game.\\
200 - [laughing]: We're watching a car chase on the news.\\
201 - [laughing]Oh.\\
202 - So I probably didn't score that three-pointer\\
203 - to win the Laker game, either.\\
204 - Are you sure you're not Jake?\\
205 - I'm not sure.\\
206 - Hey, are you guys really lesbians?\\
207 - Or are you like those "lesbians" from Craigslist\\
208 - that came over and tied me up and stole my laptop?\\
209 - [laughing]\\
210 - If we weren't, would we do this?\\
211 - Okay, brain, you are high,\\
212 - but I need you to remember this.\\
213 - Forget calculus if you have to.\\
214 - WALDEN: Hey.\\
215 - Nobody heard the pizza guy at the door?\\
216 - I told you we wouldn't have to get up.\\
217 - Told you we wouldn't have to pay for it.\\
218 - Is this all you guys have been doing the whole day?\\
219 - No, we spent an hour\\
220 - trying to find where you hid your bong.\\
221 - Which knocked me into overtime, FYI.\\
222 - Walden, I am loving it here.\\
223 - I mean, pizza, lesbians, weed scavenger hunts...\\
224 - Nobody paying rent...\\
225 - It just keeps getting better.\\
226 - Hey, Barry, can I talk to you for a second?\\
227 - WOMEN: Ooh, you're in trouble!\\
228 - [laughing]\\
229 - Is this why you're here?\\
230 - Just to hang out and get high and eat pizza?\\
231 - I feel like this is a trick question.\\
232 - 'Cause I thought you were here\\
233 - to work on a new project with me.\\
234 - No, no, no, I am!\\
235 - I am. Okay, okay, check out this idea:\\
236 - So I was watching Brooke and Jenny make out earlier,\\
237 - and I thought to myself,\\
238 - what if we filmed lesbians\\
239 - doing stuff to each other...\\
240 - and then we put that on the Internet?\\
241 - How has no one thought of that?\\
242 - I know!\\
243 - You know what?\\
244 - It's too late for them.\\
245 - They're a lost cause.\\
246 - We can hear you.\\
247 - I will give any of you... $100.\\
248 - All you have to do\\
249 - is come up here and take it from me.\\
250 - Later. Nah, I'm fine.Nah.\\
251 - Do you see that?\\
252 - Don't be them!\\
253 - I only let you stay here\\
254 - for a few days to help you transition.\\
255 - Okay, okay. I got another idea.\\
256 - Uh... bacon-flavored eggs.\\
257 - All me and you got to figure out\\
258 - is how to make the chicken and the pig have sex.\\
259 - Well, maybe you could show 'em the lesbian porn.\\
260 - Wait, wait, wait.\\
261 - I have an idea.\\
262 - What if you got the chickens drunk?\\
263 - Would that work?\\
264 - I've gotten laid a lot by getting chicks drunk.\\
265 - [laughing]\\
266 - Hey, Berta, what about you?\\
267 - You ever been with a woman?\\
268 - Have you?\\
269 - There you are.\\
270 - Get down off that couch, you naughty boy.\\
271 - [whimpering]\\
272 - Ooh, a quarter.\\
273 - Hey, this hat just paid for itself.\\
274 - Give me that.\\
275 - Drop it.\\
276 - [growling, muttering]\\
277 - Ruh-roh.\\
278 -     Men.   \\
279 -     Men.   \\
280 - So, how was Palm Springs?\\
281 - What the hell's going on here?\\
282 - It-it isn't what it looks like.\\
283 - It looks like you're having kinky sex with my sister.\\
284 - Then it is what it looks like.\\
285 - I can't believe this.\\
286 - Me, neither.\\
287 - This is the best day of my life!\\
288 - What?!\\
289 - What guy doesn't want to see his best friend bang his sister?\\
290 - What?! What?! What?!\\
291 - My two favorite people in the world got together.\\
292 - Those are your two favorite people?\\
293 - Don't worry. You're number three.\\
294 - If you were banging my sister, you'd be number one.\\
295 - Well, I'm-I'm glad you're so excited about this.\\
296 - I was worried you were gonna punch me in the face.\\
297 - Ah, if anything, I'd maybe\\
298 - swat you on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper.\\
299 - Or cut off your balls.\\
300 - Well, I'm gonna go get dressed.\\
301 - I have to take Jeff for a walk.\\
302 - Hey, you know that special bottle of champagne\\
303 - we were saving for our wedding?\\
304 - Let's pop it now!\\
305 - Why not? I just popped your sister five minutes ago.\\
306 - Jeff, you are the king!\\
307 - Really? What are you doing with Larry's sister?\\
308 - Just a little game.\\
309 - You know, I-I pretend I'm a dog, and she rescues me,\\
310 - and then I give her my bone.\\
311 - All right, Alan, you know what? Stop.\\
312 - Stop being friends with my fianc  ,\\
313 - stop dating my fianc  's sister, and stop poking me on Facebook.\\
314 - It doesn't mean what you think it does.\\
315 - You know what? You can't tell me what to do.\\
316 - I am my own man.\\
317 - I will do what I want\\
318 - with whomever I want whenever I want.\\
319 - Now, excuse me.\\
320 - [groans]\\
321 - You're standing on my leash.\\
322 -     Men.   \\
323 -     All the single Barrys, all the single Barrys    \\
324 -     Make a turkey sandwich, make a turkey sandwich    \\
325 -     If you like it then you should have put some cheese on it    \\
326 -     If you like it then you should have put some cheese on it    \\
327 -     May-a-o, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh...    \\
328 - Oh, hey.\\
329 - Bare, can I talk to you?\\
330 - Sure. What's up?\\
331 - Let me ask you something.\\
332 - Suppose you had someone living with you,\\
333 - and you wanted them to leave.\\
334 - How would you go about making that clear?\\
335 - Well, I don't like confrontation,\\
336 - so I'd probably do something passive-aggressive\\
337 - like sit them down\\
338 - and ask them how they would approach...\\
339 - Oh, you're asking me to move out.\\
340 - No, no, no, no, I'm not asking you to move out.\\
341 - I'm-I'm asking you to move in...\\
342 - to the... outside.\\
343 - Okay.\\
344 - Boy, man, I'm so sorry.\\
345 - I just have been having a lot of fun here, you know.\\
346 - Everybody's so nice, and you've been so welcoming.\\
347 - Up until just now when you told me to get the hell out.\\
348 - Don't get me wrong.\\
349 - It's not that I don't love having you here.\\
350 - It's just that I don't think that I can legally\\
351 - have anyone else live here unless I adopt them.\\
352 - I'm down for that.\\
353 - Okay, well, let's table that,\\
354 - but in-in the meantime, we'll look for an apartment for you.\\
355 - Uh, well, I mean, today is kind of already shot.\\
356 - Maybe pick it up tomorrow?\\
357 - Yeah. Okay, yeah.\\
358 - I mean, it's-it's 10:30.\\
359 - In the morning.\\
360 - Great. Uh, I'm gonna go get high\\
361 - and eat my sandwich out on the deck.\\
362 - Okay.\\
363 - He's never moving out.\\
364 - Hey. Oh, hey.\\
365 - Wait. Are you just getting back from your date with Gretchen?\\
366 - No. No, no. I had to go back to the restaurant.\\
367 - I left my hat at the valet stand.\\
368 - Liar!\\
369 - You would never pay for parking.\\
370 - All right, admit it, you slept with Gretchen.\\
371 - You're right, I slept with her.\\
372 - And I found a broken meter two blocks from the restaurant.\\
373 - I thought you were calling it off with her.\\
374 - Well, I started to, but you-you know how breakups go.\\
375 - I mean, you try to be considerate\\
376 - and let her down easy, and next thing you know,\\
377 - you're wearing a dog collar and a leash\\
378 - while she lets you lick peanut butter\\
379 - out of a chew toy between her boobs.\\
380 -     Men.   \\
381 - Whoa...\\
382 - Look at this place.\\
383 - Hello, apartment, good-bye panties, huh?\\
384 - I don't think this place is for me.\\
385 - It just doesn't scream "Barry."\\
386 - It will when the panties come off.\\
387 - No. Plus, the feng shui is just off.\\
388 - All right.\\
389 - This is the sixth place you didn't like.\\
390 - And the last one you said was in a bad school district.\\
391 - What's going on here?\\
392 - Nothing. Nothing's going on. I just...\\
393 - I've never really lived alone before.\\
394 - Never?\\
395 - Well, when my dad left, I lived with my mom,\\
396 - and then boarding school,\\
397 - and then, in college, I always had roommates,\\
398 - and then after college, I lived with Nicole.\\
399 - I mean, I'm like a baby duck, Walden.\\
400 - When Mama Duck leaves, I cling to the next mama duck.\\
401 - Okay, but my flock is too big,\\
402 - so, you gotta get the flock out of my house.\\
403 - I don't know if I can make it on my own.\\
404 - Okay, listen, I know what's going on.\\
405 - I know how you feel.\\
406 - I felt the same way when my wife walked out on me.\\
407 - What did you do?\\
408 - I bought a house\\
409 - and let a 45-year-old man and his son live there.\\
410 - Wow. A real Scared Straightmoment here.\\
411 - Let's grab up a pizza on the way back to the beach.\\
412 - Barry, listen to me.\\
413 - I'm going to say something to you\\
414 - that I have never said before in my life.\\
415 - You can't live with me.\\
416 - Oh, my God.\\
417 - [laughing]\\
418 - I did it.\\
419 - I'm sorry. You're-You're my first.\\
420 - No, no, no, I don't want to be your first.\\
421 - Your first should be someone special,\\
422 - like a whore that your stepdad buys you.\\
423 - ...is an example I just made up.\\
424 - Listen, Barry, you're... you are gonna be okay.\\
425 - And you can come and visit anytime that you want.\\
426 - Really?\\
427 - Yeah, just stop on by.\\
428 - But you can't live with me!\\
429 - Now or ever.\\
430 - Okay, but I can't just stay here.\\
431 - Yes, you can!\\
432 - I'm gonna take care of the paperwork,\\
433 - and then I'll send your stuff over.\\
434 - You just make yourself at home.\\
435 - But you can't live with me!\\
436 - All right, message received.\\
437 - Okay, I'm sorry-- I'm just... I'm really excited.\\
438 - This is a big moment for me.\\
439 - I'm gonna go find Alan.\\
440 - You can't live with me!\\
441 - You can't live with me!\\
442 - Oh, I'm sorry, sir.\\
443 - But you can't live with me!\\
444 -     Men.   \\
445 - I can't tell you how happy I am you guys are dating.\\
446 - [laughs]\\
447 - No offense, Sis, but some of the guys you've brought home--\\
448 - I mean, no job, no house, no car.\\
449 - Real losers.\\
450 - Wow, sounds like the deadbeats\\
451 - I used to date before I found Larry.\\
452 - Well, I've, uh, I've had some real winners in my past, too.\\
453 - Cheaters, drunks,\\
454 - 45-year-old women trying to pass as 38.\\
455 - Lyndsey just turned 38!\\
456 - Well, luckily, those people are out of our lives now.\\
457 - Yeah, but sometimes I swear\\
458 - I can see their stupid faces right in front of me.\\
459 - That might be a wine-induced hallucination.\\
460 - Speaking of wine, a toast to the four of us.\\
461 - May this be the first of many dinners, celebrations,\\
462 - holidays, vacations, anniversaries...\\
463 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it.\\
464 - To us. Bottoms up.[Alan chuckles]\\
465 - I know mine will be.\\
466 - Mmm! You are a bad girl. [chuckles]\\
467 - [clears her throat]\\
468 - I think we're making them uncomfortable.\\
469 - Not as uncomfortable as last night,\\
470 - having sex with your butt on a hot stove.\\
471 - We were fooling around in the kitchen,\\
472 - and I picked him up in a moment of passion.\\
473 - [laughs]\\
474 - I loved it.\\
475 - LARRY: Wow!\\
476 - Lyndsey doesn't use the stove for cooking or sex.\\
477 - Sweetie, sweetie, what are you doing?\\
478 - Don't forget the little butter packets.Oh!\\
479 - You're my little butter packet.\\
480 - Oh.\\
481 - [chuckles]\\
482 - Doesn't look like they're thinking\\
483 - about any of their exes now.\\
484 - No, it doesn't.\\
485 - He's thinking about banging my sister.\\
486 - I know what he's thinking!\\
487 -     Men.   \\
488 - Okay.\\
489 - One roommate down, two to go.\\
490 - Alan...\\
491 - Hey, there he is.\\
492 - Barry?\\
493 - What are you doing here?\\
494 - Well, you said I could stop by anytime I wanted, so...\\
495 - Yeah, but I-I just left you.\\
496 - 17 minutes ago.\\
497 - I know. I missed you, too.\\
498 - Walden, are you done? We're in the middle of a game.\\
499 - Hey, can you go on a beer run?\\
500 - What the hell is going on here?\\
501 - This is my house!\\
502 - BERTA: Do you mind?!\\
503 - Some of us are trying to nap!\\
504 -     Men.   \\
505 - Oh, oh, well, then put up a sign that says\\
506 - only one roll of mints per customer.\\
507 - [door closes]\\
508 - Oh.\\
509 - Lyndsey.\\
510 - Are you waiting?\\
511 - Someone pooping in there?\\
512 - What the hell was that about?\\
513 - [imitating Gretchen]: "You're my little butter packet."\\
514 - What upset you more?\\
515 - That she stole that bread...\\
516 - or my heart?\\
517 - So you are doing this just to make me jealous.\\
518 - No, that's not it at all.\\
519 - Too bad, 'cause it's working.\\
520 - I'm sorry, I...\\
521 - No, I-I really like Gretchen.\\
522 - I-I can't do this.\\
523 - Jeff Strongman can't.\\
524 - But Alan Harper can.\\
525 - Works for me.\\
526 - [both moaning]\\
527 - Is that a roll of mints in your pocket\\
528 - or are you just happy to see me?\\
529 - Actually, it is a roll of mints.\\
530 - And a comb.\\
531 - And a bottle of Paco Rabanne.\\
532 -     Men.   \\
533 -     Men.   \\
534 - All right, the shot for the win.\\
535 - Be the ball, see the cups.\\
536 - Hey, Barry, check out these cups.\\
537 - Aah! Ball to the face.\\
538 - First time for everything.\\
539 - I may need to see that again and again.\\
540 - Walden, we have security cameras, right?\\
541 - Where's Walden?\\
542 - [music soundtrack playing on TV]\\
543 - I could totally live here.\\
544 - [laughs] Screech, will you never learn?\\

14 - Oh, ho, ho, boy.\\
15 - What?\\
16 - Just got an interesting e-mail.\\
17 - If it says, "Local horny housewives looking for action,"\\
18 - it's a lie.\\
19 - It should say, "Local police entrapping confused citizens."\\
20 - It's an Evite from Kate.\\
21 - She's opening a boutique in LA.\\
22 - Who's Kate?\\
23 - Eh, it's a long story.\\
24 - It's not that long.\\
25 - Kate was the great love of Walden's life\\
26 - who he met by pretending he was poor.\\
27 - But by the time he told her the truth,\\
28 - she'd become a successful clothing designer\\
29 - and moved to China.\\
30 - At first they e-mailed frequently but...\\
31 - you know, it tapered off over time.\\
32 - Now he just uses Google Earth to try to look\\
33 - in her bedroom window, but the image hasn't refreshed\\
34 - in months, so he just stares for hours at this picture\\
35 - of this Hong Kong cab driver named Bai Ling, it's...\\
36 - I never told you any of that.\\
37 - Well, it's kind of my job to know\\
38 - the ins and outs of your life.\\

41 - come up with a harder password than\\
42 - "QD-backslash-seven-two-dollar symbol-big-C-little-K."\\
43 - Look, she-she says, "I hope to see ya."\\
44 - That's good, right?\\
45 - Is it "ya," Y-A,\\
46 - or "you," Y-O-U?\\
47 - "Ya." Y-A.\\
48 - Ehh. Mm.\\
49 - Why ehh? She hopes I can make it.\\
50 - I say "ya" when I want to blow somebody off.\\
51 - See ya.\\

56 - Never done this before, have "ya"?\\
57 - I'm your cousin, what's wrong with...\\
58 - "ya"?\\
59 - It doesn't matter whether it's you or ya.\\
60 - The important thing is she wants me to go.\\
61 - On the other hand,\\
62 - it could be a mass e-mail.\\
63 - I'd hate to show up and have her talking to some guy\\
64 - named Jacques or Filippo.\\
65 - Okay, those names are awesome.\\
66 - Hi, it's-a me, Filippo.\\
67 - I live with my mother but it's-a not weird 'cause I'm Italian.\\

150 - O-Okay, I-I can explain, thi-thi... uh...\\

155 - He's not stupid.\\
156 - You're right, honey. I am weak.\\

161 -     Men.   \\
162 - Oh, my God. I'm so nervous.\\

173 - That's a lie.\\
174 - I think about it every day.\\
175 - You look beautiful, too.\\
176 - Thank you. I'm using a new seaweed scrub.\\
177 - It makes me smell like dead fish, but I get a glow.\\
178 - This is Barry and Jenny.\\
179 - Uh, they're my...\\
180 - new Alans.Oh. Hi, it's nice to meet you.\\
181 - You, too.\\
182 - You look different than your satellite photos.\\
183 - Whoa, Barry.Can you hang on one second?\\
184 - I just have to say good-bye to this magazine editor.Uh, yeah, sure.\\
185 - Okay, I'll be right back.Okay.\\
186 - Oh, uh, uh, if you can't find me,\\
187 - just follow the smell of dead fish.\\
188 - Oh, my God, if I die tonight, that's gonna be\\
189 - the last thing she remembers me saying.\\
190 - [hacks]\\
191 - Would you just relax?\\
192 - She's obviously into you. I mean,\\
193 - she looks at you the way that...\\
194 - he looks at me.\\
195 - Like... she wants to eat me?\\
196 - Exactly.\\
197 - Barry, when I said, "bite me,"\\
198 - it didn't mean what you think it means.\\
199 - Just-Just ask her out.\\
200 - What... And then what? Then she goes back to China,\\
201 - and I get left heartbroken again?\\
202 - Think about it this way:\\
203 - You can either spend the next two days hanging out with her\\
204 - or the next two days hanging out with us.\\
205 - Kate...?\\
206 - Come on, Barry.\\
207 - Let's get drunk and grope models.\\
208 - That's nice.\\
209 - Oh...!\\
210 - What... Walden? Sorry.\\
211 - I... [chuckles] So my date's a little tipsy.\\
212 - Don't worry, she's not driving.\\
213 - Hey, do you want to go out?\\
214 - I don't know, for-for dinner or something?\\
215 - I mean, no pressure. Just two old friends catching up.\\
216 - Yeah. Two old friends who've...\\
217 - taken pictures of each other naked.\\
218 - I don't know what you're talking about.\\
219 - I deleted those photos.I didn't.\\
220 - Me neither.[laughs]\\
221 - Well, I do want to hear what's been going on.\\
222 - I've got so much to tell you.\\
223 - So let's-let's do it.\\
224 - Okay. Dinner.\\
225 - Conversation. No sex.\\
226 - Get rid of the conversation and we can pretend we're married.\\
227 - [laughs]    Men.   \\
228 - Well, thanks again. This was fun.\\
229 - I'm gonna walk Jeff out.\\
230 - Oh, right, you guys probably want some privacy\\
231 - so you can play tonsil hockey.\\
232 - Seriously, Larry?\\
233 - What? It's not like we don't know they're having sex.\\
234 - Remember the other night when I was like,\\
235 - "Wow, they're really going at it," and you were like,\\
236 - "Larry," and I was like, "What?," and you were like\\
237 - "Focus on me," and I was like, "Why? I already finished,"\\
238 - and you were like...I remember.\\
239 - Why don't I get the door for you?\\
240 - Well, uh, once again, we had a lovely\\
241 - Yeah, yeah, see ya.evening, it was a very nice...\\
242 - Wow. That was uncomfortable.\\
243 - I think Lyndsey's tired of having me around.\\
244 - I've been living in the guest room for two weeks.\\
245 - Doesn't seem so long to me.\\
246 - Hey, how about tomorrow night, we go to your place?\\
247 - Uh, my place?\\
248 - Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Oh, oh, but, uh,\\
249 - but what about Larry? I mean, he-he seems to really enjoy\\
250 - hearing us have sex.\\
251 - Jeff, do you not want me to see your place?\\
252 - I mean, If you're worried about getting rid of your porn, don't.\\
253 - I love porn.\\
254 - You're perfect.\\
255 - Did someone make you in the lab\\
256 - or were you sent directly from Heaven?\\
257 - That's me.\\
258 - I am a robot angel\\
259 - who loves masturbating to pornography.\\
260 - My place it is. Tomorrow night.\\
261 - Great.\\
262 - I can't wait to see what your place looks like.\\
263 - [chuckles]\\
264 - [door closes]\\
265 - Neither can I.\\
266 -     Men.   \\
267 - Mm! Oh, uh, quick, Barry, call the police.\\
268 - A male model is robbing us and he's already stolen my heart.\\
269 - What do you want?\\
270 - My heart back.\\
271 - Also, uh, Gretchen is coming over tonight.\\
272 - Why?\\
273 - She wants to see Jeff Strongman's place.\\
274 - This isn't even Alan Harper's place.\\
275 - Ooh, "Alan Harper's Place." That's a...\\
276 - That's a good name for a sitcom.\\
277 - Alan Harper's Place\\
278 - is filmed before a live studio audience.\\
279 - That's funny. Anyway...\\
280 - just while she's here, just call me Jeff.\\
281 - Or Mr. Strongman, J-Dawg, you know, whatever.\\
282 - Just have fun with it.\\
283 - Okay, I'm gonna go on my date now.\\
284 - And when I get back, I don't want to see Gretchen\\
285 - or Jeff or J-Dawg\\
286 - or DJ Strongman.\\
287 - [chuckles] Word.\\
288 - Yeah. You know, in fact, I don't even want to see Alan\\
289 - or A-Dawg or any of the cast of Alan Harper's Place.\\
290 - You know...\\
291 - if I had a place to sleep here,\\
292 - my apartment would be free.\\
293 - You had me at "free."\\
294 -     Men.   \\
295 - So, have you traveled around China at all?\\
296 - Did you get to see the Great Wall?\\
297 - Yeah, I saw it.\\
298 - It's a good wall.\\
299 - It's not great.\\
300 - I felt the same way about the Grand Canyon.\\
301 - More like the Bland Canyon.\\
302 - [laughs] I'm glad we came back here.\\
303 - I thought it was appropriate to come back to the place\\
304 - we had our first date.\\
305 - Yeah, it's very sweet.\\
306 - Of course, that's when I thought you were poor.\\
307 - Now you're just cheap.\\
308 - Well, I figured since we're not having sex,\\
309 - why bother spending a lot of money on dinner?\\
310 - Tonight just kind of feels right, you know?\\
311 - Totally. And, honestly,\\
312 - the no sex thing isn't weird at all.\\
313 - I didn't even have to shave my legs.\\
314 - I did, but that was more of a personal choice.[laughs]\\
315 - It's like friends with no benefits.\\
316 - Yeah, I actually kind of prefer it.\\
317 - I mean, there's no pressure.No nerves.\\
318 - No walk of shame.\\
319 - No massages.\\
320 - No... hot oil.\\
321 - No kisses on my neck.\\
322 - No fingers running down my spine.\\
323 - No orgasms.\\
324 - No idea why we're not having sex right now.\\
325 - I'll race you to the car.I'm right behind you.\\
326 -     Men.   \\
327 -     Men.   \\
328 - Oh, God, I've been waiting a year for this.\\
329 - It feels so great to be with you again.\\
330 - Uh-uh-uh. That's against the rules.\\
331 - No feelings.\\
332 - So you don't want me to feel this?\\
333 - [gasps]\\
334 - Apparently, the rules can be bent.\\
335 - And straightened. [chuckles]\\
336 - [moaning]\\
337 - [stomach gurgles]\\
338 - Was that... you or me?\\
339 - Girls don't make sounds like that, Walden.\\
340 - Oh. Mm.\\
341 - [moaning][stomach gurgles]\\
342 - That was you!\\
343 - [retching, vomiting]\\
344 - Did I make it to the toilet?\\
345 -     Men.   \\
346 - Oh, this is a cute place.\\
347 - Yeah, it really is cute, isn't it?\\
348 - I really like what I've done with it.\\
349 - [cat meows]\\
350 - Oh, and you have a cat.\\
351 - Apparently I do.\\
352 - What's his name?\\
353 - Uh, his name is... Mister...\\
354 - Cat.\\
355 - You are terrible at coming up with names, Jeff Strongman.\\
356 - Hey, you didn't tell me you went to MIT.\\
357 - Uh, well, you know, I don't like to brag. [chuckles]\\
358 - Well, what'd you major in?\\
359 - Uh... math.\\
360 - With a-a focus on...\\
361 - numbers.\\
362 - I'm terrible at math.\\
363 - Every time I count to 100, I keep getting stuck on 69.\\
364 - [chuckles] Ooh, dirty math jokes.\\
365 - Let's see how many times your orgasms multiply.\\
366 - [giggles]\\
367 - We really are perfect for each other.\\
368 - I know, right?\\
369 - Can I tell you something?\\
370 - Yeah, of course, anything.\\
371 - You are the first man I have trusted since my divorce.\\
372 - Well, uh, you know, MIT stands for "Man I Trust," so...\\
373 - No, it's... it's more than that.\\
374 - My husband was a liar and a cheater.\\
375 - He was not the man I thought he was.\\
376 - Well, you know, some guys can be real jerks.\\
377 - Well, thank God you're not like that, Jeff.\\
378 - [chuckling]: Yeah. Thank God.\\
379 - I'm sorry. I don't mean to bring us down. It just...\\
380 - feels so good to open up and let somebody in again, you know?\\
381 - Aw, well, I'm glad you did.\\
382 - In fact, I'm not even gonna make a dirty joke\\
383 - about you opening up and letting me in.Oh!\\
384 - You care enough about me to pass up sexy wordplay.[chuckles]\\
385 - And it was very hard on me. [chuckles]\\
386 - You said "hard on."Kiss me.\\
387 -     Men.   \\
388 - [Kate moaning]\\
389 - How you doing in there? You okay?\\
390 - Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.\\
391 - [moans]\\
392 - You know, if someone read a transcript of this date,\\
393 - it'd sound like we were having hot sex.\\
394 - Oh, God, it's in my hair.\\
395 - That sounds like we just finished having hot sex.\\
396 - [distant shriek]\\
397 - What was that?\\
398 - Hold on. I think Alan just saw a spider again.\\
399 - What the hell is going on?\\
400 - Whoa. Lyndsey.\\
401 - Barry!\\
402 - Wait, you two didn't...\\
403 - Are you kidding? No!\\
404 - Third base.\\
405 - I got into bed to surprise Alan, and...\\
406 - Scusi.\\
407 - Where is Alan?\\
408 - Uh, he's at my place.\\
409 - What? What?\\
410 - [stomach gurgles]\\
411 - What the hell was that?\\
412 - Oh, God.\\
413 - [retching]\\
414 - So... you ready for a ride on the Barry-go-round?\\
415 -     Men.   \\
416 - [moans, sniffs]\\
417 - [grunts] I really regret buying a wicker wastebasket right now.\\
418 - Thank you.\\
419 - I can't help feeling this is my fault.\\
420 - Why? Just 'cause you ordered the squid surprise?\\
421 - "Try it, Walden, it won't kill you."\\
422 - I wish it had. [laughs]\\
423 - Only you could make me smile when I'm this sick.\\
424 - I really missed you.\\
425 - I've missed you, too.\\
426 - Even if this is the way that we spend the whole time\\
427 - that you're here...\\
428 - ...I'm just glad that we're together.\\

452 - Oh, hey, Lyndsey, what's up?\\
453 - Where were you last night?Last night?\\
454 - And don't do that thing where you ask questions\\
455 - while you think of a lie.\\
456 - That thing where I ask questions while I think of a lie?\\
457 - I was with Gretchen.\\
458 - I see. Well, I snuck into your room\\
459 - to give you a little surprise\\
460 - and molested the kid sleeping in your bed.\\
461 - Please tell me he's 18.\\
462 - Honestly, if you told me he was anywhere from 12 to 60\\
463 - I'd believe you.\\
464 - Okay, fine. L-Let's not waste time fighting.\\
465 - I have a half hour till I have to go meet Larry.\\
466 - He's in the park feeding the frickin' ducks.\\

479 - Good-bye, Alan.\\
480 - Well, well, look who's back for more.\\
481 - Get away from me, ya freak.\\
482 - Wait, did you say "ya" or "you"?\\
483 -     Men.   \\
484 - [sighs] Well...\\
485 - this has been horrible.\\
486 - Yes.\\
487 - But from now on, every time you see a toilet,\\
488 - you'll think of me.\\
489 - And every time you hear a woman say\\
490 - "Hold my hair out of the puke water,"\\
491 - you'll think of me.[chuckles]\\
492 - So, listen,\\
493 - next time we see each other, if we're still single,\\
494 - we'll forget all the rules and just... bang our brains out.\\
495 - At the very least,\\
496 - I'll get an air mattress for the bathroom floor.\\
497 - [chuckles] Agreed.\\
498 - Let's not make a big deal of this.\\
499 - Let's just... kiss and say good-bye.\\
500 - Bye.Bye.\\

510 - I'm not lighter, I'm just empty.\\
511 - [whoops, chuckles]\\
512 - Puking all night and screwing all day.\\
513 - It's like Charlie never left.\\
514 -     Men.   \\
515 -     Men.   \\
516 - [cat screeching]Ow, ow!\\
517 - [cat yowling]D-Down, Mr. Cat.\\
518 - Down! Down!\\
519 - I really love that little guy.\\
520 - You want some breakfast?\\
521 - Uh, sure, if it comes with a side order of Gretchen.\\
522 - You can serve me over easy.\\
523 - And you can serve me sunny-side all up in your bid-ness.\\
524 - [chuckles]\\
525 - Oh. Hey.\\
526 - Who the hell are you?No, it-it's okay, it's okay.\\
527 - This is my...\\
528 - ...son.\\

81 - What you guys doing?\\
82 - I am taking Jenny to the movies.\\
83 - Okay, you're not taking me.\\
84 - Taking me implies we're going on a date.\\

87 - Hey. Hold on. Uh, before you go,\\
88 - which one of these engagement rings\\

114 - We... never met, but I'm the guy who took your place.\\
115 - Thanks for giving up your house.\\
116 - I guess you didn't really give it up-- you died.\\
117 - You'd have to be on crack to give up all this.\\
118 - Anyway, I...\\
119 - Is Jenny right?\\
120 - I mean, do I fall in love too fast?\\
121 - Come on, Charlie,\\

127 - [thunder rumbles]\\
128 -     Men.   \\
129 - Here, try my famous guacamole.\\
130 - Oh, what makes it famous?\\
131 - I don't know. It's...\\
132 - really good and everybody likes it.\\
133 - I didn't think you'd actually call me on it.\\
134 - Do you have any famous recipes?\\
135 - Well, there's the-the Strongman family meatloaf.\\
136 - You'll have to make that for me.\\
137 - Uh, the recipe died with my grandmother. Oh.\\
138 - We'd always say, "Write it down, write it down."\\
139 - And she'd say... [European accent]: "Tomorrow."\\
140 - One day, your tomorrows run out.\\
141 - Oh, Nana Strongman. Aw.\\
142 - Every day, I learn something new about my Jeff.\\
143 - [chuckles] You and me both.\\
144 - I wish we could be together every day.\\
145 - Oh, what would that be like?\\
146 - Well, let's put it this way:\\
147 - The Strongman meat would not be loafing.\\
148 - Move in with me.\\
149 - Seriously?\\
150 - You make this place a home.\\
151 - When you're not here, this apartment feels\\
152 - like it belongs to somebody else.\\
153 - So what do you say?\\
154 - I say yes.\\
155 - Oh, my God, that's great!\\
156 - But I insist on paying half the rent.\\
157 - I love you.\\
158 - Cash only.\\
159 -     Men.   \\
160 - Can I help you?\\
161 - Hey, sorry to bother you. I...\\
162 - I've been hiking all day, and I saw you had a hose out here,\\
163 - and I was wondering if I could fill up my water bottle.\\
164 - I have a hose?\\
165 - Yeah.\\
166 - Bottom of the stairs.\\
167 - Good for me.\\
168 - Uh, I... actually, I have filtered water in the kitchen.\\
169 - Oh, I kind of had my heart set on dirty hose water,\\
170 - but if you insist.\\
171 - [angelic choir singing]\\
172 - Should I...\\
173 - I'm sorry, what?\\
174 - [chuckles] Sh-Should I wipe my feet?\\
175 - I-I don't want\\
176 - to track beach sand into your...\\
177 - ...house sand?\\
178 - Oh, no. That's-that's not sand.\\
179 - That's the remains of the guy who used to live here.\\
180 - You know what, maybe I'll just use the hose outside. It's fine.No, no, no, no.\\
181 - No, it's not like that. He gets spilled all the time.\\
182 - At this point, he's mostly lint. I'm Walden.\\
183 - Vivian.\\
184 - That's a beautiful name.\\
185 - Thank you. My parents got it from that '70s show.\\
186 - What was it called? Maude.\\
187 - Ah. Yeah.\\
188 - Wow, this is...\\
189 - this is quite a place.[chuckles]\\
190 - Your desk is backwards.\\
191 - Excuse me?\\
192 - Well, you have this beautiful view of the ocean,\\
193 - and yet your desk is facing the wall with...\\
194 - a picture of the ocean on it.\\
195 - Yeah. It's... actually, it's-it's the Atlantic.\\
196 - [chuckles]\\
197 - It's an inside joke.\\
198 - For myself.\\
199 - [thunder rumbles]\\
200 - Uh, you know what, I better fill up and get going.\\
201 - But it's, like... it's really starting to come down out there.\\
202 - It's just a little water. I'm not gonna melt.\\
203 - It's not like I'm the Wicked Witch of the West.\\
204 - I mean, you could wait it out here if you want.\\
205 - We could have dinner together.\\
206 - I'll-I'll order delivery.\\
207 - Really?\\
208 - Wow. Uh, yeah.\\
209 - That'd be great.\\
210 - Great. Okay.\\
211 - [chuckles] Thank you.\\
212 - You know, I-I got to ask, do you always invite strangers\\
213 - into your home?\\
214 - Oh, no. Usually they invite themselves.\\
215 -     Men.   \\
216 - I am so excited to move in with you.\\
217 - Hey, on top of paying half the rent,\\
218 - I insist on paying half the utilities.\\
219 - Thank you. By the way, there's also a security deposit,\\
220 - a cleaning deposit and the groceries\\
221 - you've already eaten half of. But we'll figure that out later.\\
222 - We're gonna have so much fun.[chuckles]\\
223 - Oh. Oh. If this is gonna get any more physical,\\
224 - I got to go freshen up.\\
225 - You mean poop?\\
226 - I love you so much.\\
227 - Oh, hey, if, uh, the pizza guy shows up,\\
228 - I don't have any money.\\
229 - Hey, that's my line!\\
230 - My wallet's on the counter.Thanks.\\
231 - [slow motion]: Wait...!\\
232 - Who's Alan Harper?\\
233 - A guy who no longer has to poop.\\
234 -     Men.   \\
235 - So, what's your deal, Walden?\\
236 - Good-looking guy, rich, Malibu beach house.\\
237 - I bet you only date hot actresses.\\
238 - God, no. I'd never date an actress.\\
239 - They're all crazy.\\
240 - I'm sure they're not all crazy.\\
241 - Trust me. They are.\\
242 - I don't get this whole fascination\\
243 - with celebrities anyway.\\
244 - I mean, who cares who's dating whom\\
245 - or who's engaged to who\\
246 - or who has a sex tape that no one will ever, ever see?\\
247 - I know. But I have to say\\
248 - I am a sucker for anything having to do\\
249 - with Brangelina or Kimye.\\
250 - Yeah, I have no idea what that means.\\
251 - I thought we were eating Kimye.\\
252 - What, have you been hiding under a rock for the last few years?\\
253 - No, but I have climbed a few.\\
254 - I was a Sherpa in Nepal.\\
255 - Yeah. And I...\\
256 - I drove cattle in Argentina.\\
257 - And I, uh... Oh, I used to give safari tours in Africa.\\
258 - And, once, I was an assistant manager at a Hot Dog on a Stick\\
259 - in Pittsburgh.\\
260 - I love hot dogs.\\
261 - [laughs]\\
262 - I've never even thought about doing stuff like that.\\
263 - I mean, although I did\\
264 - once sit in the splash section at SeaWorld without a poncho.\\
265 - Well, then you'd be perfect for my next adventure.\\
266 - Crewing on a sailboat to Polynesia.\\
267 - Wow.\\
268 - A sailboat to Polynesia.\\
269 - So what island do you want to hit first?\\
270 - As long as we're together,\\
271 - it doesn't matter.\\
272 - [gasping]\\
273 - That was a close one.\\
274 - I barely caught you guys.\\
275 - I'm still living with you, right?\\
276 - Whoa...\\
277 - VIVIAN [distant]: Walden.\\
278 - Walden.Huh?\\
279 - Which one do you want?\\
280 - Right now I want both.\\
281 - Oh, here. [laughs]\\
282 - Oh.\\
283 - "A new love awaits you."\\
284 - Wow.\\
285 - Mine says, "Try our gluten-free wontons."\\
286 -     Men.   \\
287 - Okay, uh, you asked, uh, "Who is Alan Harper?"\\
288 - And you deserve the truth.\\
289 - My real name is Alan Harper.\\
290 - I-I used to date Lyndsey, but when she broke up with me,\\
291 - I wanted to meet her new boyfriend, Larry,\\
292 - but I didn't want him to know that it was me,\\
293 - so I created a fake persona, Jeff Strongman,\\
294 - but then Larry and I became real friends,\\
295 - and then you came along, and I really liked you,\\
296 - and everything was perfect until you picked up my wallet\\
297 - to pay for the pizza, which reinforces my one rule:\\
298 - "Never offer to pay for anything!"\\
299 - Wow. So nothing I know about you is real?\\
300 - My-my feelings for you are real.\\
301 - And I was telling the truth when I said\\
302 - I wanted you to live with me.\\
303 - What about your son?\\
304 - Oh, oh, that-that wasn't a lie.\\
305 - I have a son, just not the guy you met.\\
306 - M.I.T.?\\
307 - L.I.E.\\
308 - Anything else?\\
309 - I take regular condoms, and I put them in the Magnum box.\\
310 - Yeah, I kind of figured that.\\
311 - All right, good-bye, Jeff.\\
312 - Alan. Whatever your name is.\\
313 - Please, Gretchen, Gretchen, don't go, don't go.\\
314 - I really do care for you. Oh!\\
315 - Gretchen, come back!\\
316 - You have the pizza coupon!\\
317 -     Men.   \\
318 -     Men.   \\
319 - Wow, look at you.\\
320 - Now you can look at the ocean and watch porn at the same time.\\
321 - Oh, I don't like looking at naked women.\\
322 - That didn't come out right.\\
323 - I use this computer for work.\\
324 - In fact, it's what paid for this view.\\
325 - This view is free.\\
326 - Everything you say is like a bumper sticker.\\
327 - Well, I'm just gonna keep on truckin', then!\\
328 - Hey, don't forget to coexist.\\
329 - You know, it's with all the religious symbols?\\
330 - The star of David and the fish.\\
331 - It's a bumper sticker. Never mind.\\
332 - All right, where-where... where you headed?\\
333 - Carbon Canyon tonight, and then the...\\
334 - the road is open, and so is my mind.\\
335 - [gasps] Ooh, that could be a bumper sticker.\\
336 - Hey, uh, why don't you give me your number?\\
337 - We'll have to stay in touch.\\
338 - I don't have a phone.\\
339 - That is awesome.\\
340 - So I guess this is good-bye.\\
341 - I-I guess so.\\
342 - Hey, thanks for letting me crash on your couch\\
343 - and for the hot shower.\\
344 - By the way, your staff is so attentive.\\
345 - I mean, that Barry kid checked up on me,\\
346 - like, five times during the night.\\
347 - All right, you know,\\
348 - I-I don't usually say this to people in this house, but...\\
349 - if you want, you can stay longer.\\
350 - You're very sweet, Walden,\\
351 - but, uh, I gotta get going.\\
352 - Enjoy your view.\\
353 - [chuckles]\\
354 - Hey, Vivian.\\
355 - Yeah?\\
356 - Are you gonna be okay?\\
357 - Yeah, I'll be fine.\\
358 - I mean, this is... this is what I do.\\
359 - Okay.\\
360 - Walden?\\
361 - Yeah?\\
362 - Are you gonna be okay?\\
363 - I do...\\
364 - think I'm gonna be okay.\\
365 -     Men.   \\
366 - Okay, I think I, uh, got all my stuff.\\
367 - Okay, that is my lamp.\\
368 - Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah, but I put a new bulb in it.\\
369 - So, you know, I'll just wait till this one blows out,\\
370 - then I'll shoot it right back to you.\\
371 - Okay. Or...\\
372 - [doorbell rings]\\
373 - I'll be back for you.\\
374 - Gretchen?\\
375 - I'm glad you're here.\\
376 - I realized the only thing\\
377 - I actually know about you is where you live.\\
378 - Well...\\
379 - Oh, my God, is everything about you a lie?\\
380 - Are you even cheap?\\
381 - I am cheap.\\
382 - Two of the four windows in my car are garbage bags.\\
383 - Look... look, I know\\
384 - I was an idiot, but-but what I said before\\
385 - about how much I care about you, I-I meant that.\\
386 - But... you know,\\
387 - I-I understand if you want nothing to do with me.\\
388 - That's why I'm here.\\
389 - Look, I made my share of mistakes\\
390 - when my husband left me.\\
391 - I know how hurtful it can be.\\
392 - I know how crazy you can become.\\
393 - I mean, I'm sure you Googled me and saw my mug shots online.\\
394 - Uh, no. Um...\\
395 - Well, don't freak out. I was innocent.\\
396 - According to the state of Illinois.\\
397 - The point is,\\
398 - we all have secrets.\\
399 - So, are you saying that we can get back together?\\
400 - I'm saying I would like to break up with Jeff Strongman\\
401 - and get to know Alan Harper.\\
402 - Really? Oh, that's great.\\
403 - But-but first, I'd like one last moment with Jeff.\\
404 - Jeff?\\
405 - Yes?Screw you.\\
406 - Oh, God!\\
407 - [groans]\\
408 - Oh, are you okay, Alan?\\
409 -     Men.   \\
410 - Hey, you.\\
411 - Hey, you're back.\\
412 - So, I've got good news and I've got great news.\\
413 - The good news is, I did work it out\\
414 - so I could stay a few more days.\\
415 - Oh.And the great news is,\\
416 - I took my underwear off in the car.\\
417 - Hey, um...\\
418 - [grunts, stammers]\\
419 - Listen, we need... we need to talk.\\
420 - Awfully serious for someone\\
421 - who just got hit in the face with a thong.\\
422 - Here's the thing.\\
423 - While you were gone, I met someone.\\
424 - What?\\
425 - I mean, nothing happened physically.\\
426 - It's just, I can't stop thinking about her,\\
427 - and it's made me question everything,\\
428 - including my sanity\\
429 - and my interior decorating instincts.\\
430 - Are you saying that you want to be with this girl now?\\
431 - I don't know what I want.\\
432 - I just, I know I have to pursue this.\\
433 - Wow.\\
434 - I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.\\
435 - I-I never meant to hurt you.\\
436 - I don't feel the same.\\
437 - [groans]\\
438 -     Men.   \\
439 - Hi.\\
440 - Hi-ya!\\
441 - [groans]\\
442 - Oh...\\
443 - Oh, they had just dropped back down!\\
444 - Walden, what are you doing here?\\
445 - [groans]\\
446 - Remember how you asked me if I was gonna be okay?\\
447 - I don't think I am.\\
448 - Is it because I just kicked you in the balls?\\
449 - There's that.\\
450 - Uh, but before I met you,\\
451 - I was very close to asking another woman to marry me.\\
452 - But then I didn't...\\
453 - because I couldn't stop thinking of you.\\
454 - So, you came here to tell me that you dumped your girlfriend,\\
455 - sweep me off my feet, and the two of us would,\\
456 - what, sail off into the sunset together?\\
457 - Yes?\\
458 - You don't even know me.\\
459 - Okay... I know you enough\\
460 - to know that I want to know you more.\\
461 - Walden, stop it.\\
462 - I'm just a stranger who wanted to drink from your hose.\\
463 - Okay, that didn't... that didn't really come out right.\\
464 - Look, I know I don't know you\\
465 - very well, but I feel like\\
466 - you're the type of guy who falls in love easily.\\
467 - You know me perfectly! That's exactly who I am.\\
468 - I... look, we're soul mates.\\
469 - Soul mates aren't made in a day.\\
470 - Oh, that's another great bumper sticker.\\
471 - Walden, you're a great guy,\\
472 - but we lead two very different lives.\\
473 - Did I mention that I have a plane\\
474 - and I can take you anywhere you want to go?\\
475 - Do you see? You want to fly over everything.\\
476 - For you, it's all about the destination.\\
477 - For me, the journey is the destination.\\
478 - Okay, are you writing these down?\\
479 - Go home, Walden.\\
480 - [stammering]\\
481 - But I-I walked four miles to get here\\
482 - in the dark. In the woods!\\
483 - I don't even know if I can find my way home.\\
484 - Maybe I should just stay with you.\\
485 - [alarm chirps]\\
486 - Ah, dude, there's your car.\\
487 -     Men.   \\
488 -     Men.   \\
489 - Here you go, sweetie.\\
490 - Thank you.\\
491 - I'm so sorry I freaked out on you.\\
492 - It's not your fault.\\
493 - I should've known better.\\
494 - VIVIAN: I'm sorry, too.\\
495 - I should have never let you go.\\
496 - Well, you're both here now...\\
497 - and I'm ready to enjoy the view.\\
498 - You want us to kiss, Walden?\\
499 - Yeah, kiss each other.\\
500 - Do it.\\
501 - Kiss each other.\\
502 - Well, it is his house.\\

\subsection {Episode 20: Lotta Delis In Little Armenia}
1 -     Men.   \\
2 - Hello, Walden. Good to see you.\\
3 - I would say, "Good to see you," but, of course,\\
4 - when I see you, it's usually 'cause things aren't good.\\
5 - Well, if things were always good with people,\\
6 - I wouldn't have that condo in Palm Springs.\\
7 - So...\\
8 - what's going on?\\
9 - Well, I left the woman that I loved\\
10 - and thought I was gonna marry\\
11 - for another woman who I thought I loved more,\\
12 - and then...\\
13 - I lost them both.\\
14 - So tell me about these women.\\
15 - Well, Kate was my ex,\\
16 - but the only reason we broke up in the first place\\
17 - is 'cause she moved to China.\\
18 - Um, she's amazing.\\
19 - [soft laugh]\\
20 - She's smart and driven\\
21 - and sexy and beautiful.\\
22 - Then there's\\
23 - Vivian, who's a girl who knocked on my door\\
24 - 'cause she wanted to drink from my hose.\\
25 - Okay, let's table the hose part for now\\
26 - and focus on the fact that you broke up with a woman you loved\\
27 - for a stranger who knocked on your door.\\
28 - I know. Romantic, right?\\
29 - What the hell's wrong with you?\\
30 - Isn't that what I'm paying you to tell me?\\
31 - Well, if I just tell you the answers,\\
32 - I don't get to yell at you. And this has to be fun for me, too.\\
33 - Let me ask you something, Walden.\\
34 - Have you ever been able to have sex\\
35 - and not fall in love?\\
36 - Only with myself.\\
37 - Well, it seems to me you base your own value\\
38 - on who's willing to have sex with you.\\
39 - How do you feel after you sleep with someone?\\
40 - Grateful.\\
41 - Happy.\\
42 - Bashful. Dopey. Basically all the Dwarfs.\\
43 - Did it ever occur to you that these women\\
44 - might also be grateful?\\
45 - No.\\
46 - Well, why not? You're a smart,\\
47 - successful, good-looking guy.\\
48 - There are plenty of women who would love to have sex with you.\\
49 - Are you flirting with me?\\
50 - Walden, now you're attempting to forge\\
51 - an emotional attachment with your gay therapist.\\
52 - Is it working?\\
53 - A little bit. You're extremely pretty.\\
54 - But the point is,\\
55 - you need to break this pattern.\\
56 - How am I supposed to do that?\\
57 - I'm gonna write you a prescription.\\
58 - You need to learn to enjoy sexual relations\\
59 - without concluding that every woman...\\
60 - is the one.\\
61 - "Bang everything that moves."\\
62 - Twice a day, if possible. Mixing with alcohol is fine,\\
63 - just not while driving.\\
64 - Look,\\
65 - if you do this, it's very likely that the next time\\
66 - you fall in love, the emotions that you feel will be authentic\\
67 - and not just projecting on someone\\
68 - because you shared a physical connection.\\
69 - But what if the first woman I have casual sex with\\
70 - turns out to be the one?\\
71 - Wow.\\
72 - When I'm done with you,\\
73 - I'm gonna be able to buy a yacht.\\
74 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
75 -     Ah.         Men.         Men.    \\
76 -     Men.   \\
77 - So, Mr. Mardirosian, if-if you don't mind my asking,\\
78 - uh, how did you hear about my chiropractic business,\\
79 - Adjustments... [whispers]: by the Sea?\\
80 - You came into the deli.\\
81 - You asked to pay for your baba ghanoush\\
82 - with free back adjustment.\\
83 - Mm. That doesn't narrow it down.\\
84 - I made that offer in a lotta delis in Little Armenia.\\
85 - Anyway, why don't you,\\
86 - uh, hop up on the table and I'll try to make your back\\
87 - as tender as your kebobs.\\
88 - Oh, my.\\
89 - Guess this explains the hair in my hummus.\\
90 - Whoa.\\
91 - Those are balls.\\
92 - Uh, Alan, can I talk to you for a second?\\
93 - Oh, uh, uh, just, just make yourself comfortable.\\
94 - [dreamy music playing]\\
95 - [soft chimes]\\
96 - [whispers]: By the sea.\\
97 - What's going on?Well, I don't know if you've noticed,\\
98 - but I haven't really been working very much lately.\\
99 - You know, now that you mention it,\\
100 - I havenoticed that you've been here literally every day\\
101 - for the past three years.\\
102 - My point is I-I'm trying to get my business going again.\\
103 - Ergo, Adjustments... [whispers]: by the Sea.\\
104 - That's great.\\
105 - And I'm really proud of you.\\
106 - But why's it happening [whispers]: in my living room?\\
107 - Because you can charge $50 more an hour if it's\\
108 - [whispers]: by the sea.\\
109 - And not\\
110 - [whispers]: above a Quiznos.\\
111 - Okay, this is my house, not a place of business.\\
112 - It's just temporary. I-I just need to\\
113 - build up my clientele so I can rent a new space.\\
114 - I-I promise, you will not know I'm here.\\
115 - I alwaysknow you're here.\\
116 - Oh, you are so sweet.\\
117 - This is gonna be a good thing. You'll see.\\
118 - I'll never see anything but those balls again.\\
119 - [sighs]\\
120 - Of all the places he doesn't have hair.\\
121 -     Men.   \\
122 - Hey, Berta, can I ask you a personal question?\\
123 - Twice. Once in college and once\\
124 - with a waitress from Howard Johnson's.\\
125 - Oh. No, uh...\\
126 - Do you think it's possible\\
127 - to have sex with someone without an emotional attachment?\\
128 - Of course.\\
129 - My rule is, "find 'em, fornicate and forget 'em."\\
130 - Mine is "love 'em, lose 'em,\\
131 - live the rest of your life with Alan."\\
132 - [laughs]\\
133 - I think yours is catchier.\\
134 - Not as catchy as what I got from that waitress\\
135 - from Howard Johnson's.\\
136 - Thank God for penicillin.\\
137 - [doorbell rings]She should be on TV.\\
138 - Hello.\\
139 - Is this Adjustments by the Sea?\\
140 - Oh.\\
141 - Actually, it's pronounced "Adjustments...\\
142 - [whispers]: by the Sea."\\
143 - Oh, okay.\\
144 - Well I-I have an appointment with Dr. Harper at 2:00.\\
145 - Oh. Uh...\\
146 - Sorry... D-Dr. Harper isn't here right now.\\
147 - Um...\\
148 - You know what, why don't you come\\
149 - and have a seat and I'll see\\
150 - if I can reach him.\\
151 - Okay. Wow.\\
152 - Ooh, this is quite a place.\\
153 - Yes, Dr. Harper has made\\
154 - a tremendous success of his life.\\
155 - He's gone from having nothing\\
156 - to living in a house on the beach.\\
157 - How does he do it?\\
158 - [rattling, clanging]\\
159 - [phone ringing]\\
160 - Adjustments by the Sea. Please hold.\\
161 - Your call is important to us.\\
162 - Please stay on the...Alan, it's me.\\
163 - You didn't have to yell, you could've just\\
164 - hit zero at any time.\\
165 - You have a client here. Where are you?\\
166 - I'm stuck in traffic. There was an accident.\\
167 - Well, how long till you get here?I don't know.\\
168 - How long does it take the Jaws of Life to pry open a Prius?\\
169 - Just-just keep her busy.\\
170 - How? I'm not a chiropractor.\\
171 - According to the state licensing board, neither am I.\\
172 - I'll be there as soon as I can.[beeps]\\
173 - Ugh. The one time I actually want him in my house.\\
174 - I'm sorry, he's stuck in traffic.\\
175 - I'm Walden.\\
176 - It's nice to meet you. I'm Tracy.\\
177 - I have to say, the view here is very impressive.\\
178 - Oh, yeah.\\
179 - The beach is beautiful, isn't it?\\
180 - I wasn't talking about the beach.\\
181 - You're not?\\
182 - Oh.\\
183 - You're talking about...\\
184 - Thank you. [giggles]\\
185 - Um... [clears throat]\\
186 - So, Walden, are-are you a chiropractor, too?\\
187 - Oh, no. You do not want these hands\\
188 - touching your body.\\
189 - I don't have the proper credentials.\\
190 - I do, however, have a note from a doctor.\\
191 - Is that velour?\\
192 - You are adorable.\\
193 - So, how'd you hurt your back?\\
194 - You know, it might just be easier if I showed you.\\
195 - Easy's... always good.\\
196 - That's true.\\
197 - Although some things are better when they're harder.\\
198 - Oh, yeah, like working out.\\
199 - Or what you're talking about.\\
200 - I see how you hurt your back.\\
201 - I hope I didn't hurt yours.\\
202 - Sorry for the scratch marks.Yeah.\\
203 - Listen, um,\\
204 - I hope you don't take this the wrong way...\\
205 - Oh. I think taking it the wrong way is what fixed my back.\\
206 - Actually, that was an accident, but it worked out for everyone.\\
207 - Anyway, I...\\
208 - I recognize that what we just shared\\
209 - is something very intimate,\\
210 - and it would only be natural for both of us\\
211 - to be experiencing feelings\\
212 - of affection for one another,\\
213 - and perhaps develop a desire\\
214 - to share a meal or a drink\\
215 - or a couple of years together,\\
216 - but is it possible that\\
217 - what might be best\\
218 - is...\\
219 - for this to remain a\\
220 - casual encounter?\\
221 - Sure.\\
222 - Really?Yep.\\
223 - 'Cause i-if you want to get a cup of coffee...\\
224 - Oh, I got to go pick up my kids from soccer. Thanks, Walden.\\
225 - Aw. What a good mom.\\
226 - Oh, good, Mrs. Butler, I am so sorry I'm late.\\
227 - Oh, don't worry about it. It's fine.\\
228 - Uh, no, no, no, it's not. Uh,\\
229 - we still have a half an hour. Any kinks you need worked out?\\
230 - Oh, trust me, the next time I'm feel kinky, I'll be back.\\
231 - Here you go.Oh.\\
232 - But I-I didn't...Oh, don't worry about it. I got to run.\\
233 - Okay, well, c-come again.\\
234 - Oh, I will.\\
235 - Sadly, it's not the first time a woman\\
236 - has paid me not to touch her.\\
237 -     Men.   \\
238 - Morning.\\
239 - I had sex yesterday.\\
240 - Congratulations. When's the wedding?\\
241 - Oh. [mock laughs] No.\\
242 - This was different.\\
243 - If the kind of sex I had was a suit,\\
244 - it would be made of linen, because it was\\
245 - so casual.\\
246 - You? Really?\\
247 - [chuckles]\\
248 - I know. You believe it?\\
249 - We started having sex, and I caught myself\\
250 - trying to make love, and I said, "No,\\
251 - no, no."\\
252 - "This is gonna be meaningless and empty,\\
253 - "like two wild elk\\
254 - rutting on the Siberian tundra."\\
255 - You know, only male elk rut.\\
256 - And only lesbians who didn't have sex last night\\
257 - point out stupid animal facts.\\
258 - [doorbell rings]\\
259 - I got it.\\
260 - Hello?Hi. Is this Adjustments by the Sea?\\
261 - Oh, uh, actually, today it's Adjustments by the Closed Patio Door,\\
262 - because a, uh, seagull pooped on my last client.\\
263 - Uh... I am Dr. Alan Harper.\\
264 - Uh, do you have an appointment?\\
265 - Uh, I do. But I was hoping\\
266 - I could see your associate, Walden?\\
267 - Oh, no, there, uh, there must be some kind of mistake.\\
268 - Walden doesn't actually work with me.\\
269 - According to my friend Tracy, he worked with her quite well.\\
270 - Um, Tracy?\\
271 - She was here yesterday.\\
272 - For the... internal massage.\\
273 - Oh! Oh!\\
274 - Well... well, I don't...\\
275 - know what went on between the two of them,\\
276 - but this is not that type of business.\\
277 - Okay, I get it.\\
278 - Maybe this will help.Oh, no, I'm not really comfortable,\\
279 - uh, letting you stand out in the cold. Please come in.\\
280 - Um...\\
281 - Thank you.\\
282 - Now, um, if I want anything special,\\
283 - should I negotiate with Walden directly?\\
284 - Oh. No.\\
285 - No.\\
286 - No, no, no, no.\\
287 - Uh, uh, uh, Walden...\\
288 - Walden...\\
289 - considers himself an artist.\\
290 - And as far as he's concerned,\\
291 - you're just two strangers\\
292 - meeting in a chiropractic waiting room.\\
293 - Uh, any mention of money would just upset him.\\
294 - I understand.\\
295 - Yeah. Oh, and, uh, here's a diagram of the human body.\\
296 - If you'd like, you can mark the areas\\
297 - that you'd like him to give special attention to.\\
298 - Oh. Oh, my.\\
299 - Uh, "X" marks the G-spot.\\
300 - Oh, oh, good, Walden, uh, you're here.\\
301 - Um, uh, I need your help.\\
302 - Um, could you keep my client company until I get back?\\
303 - Alan,\\
304 - I'm not here to babysit your clients.\\
305 - I can do it.\\
306 - No. Uh...\\
307 - No. No.\\
308 - This is a man's job.\\
309 - I-I'll be right back.\\
310 - Hi. I'm sorry.\\
311 - Uh, Dr. Harper had to take care of something\\
312 - really quick.\\
313 - Is there anything I can offer you?\\
314 - Well, that depends.\\
315 - Can I offer youanything...\\
316 - stranger?\\
317 - Well, I do see a...\\
318 - couple things I like.\\
319 - So do I. [chuckles]\\
320 - You've got a lovely place here.\\
321 - I can't wait to see every inch of it. [laughs]\\
322 - That might take a while.\\
323 - Why?\\
324 - Is it big?\\
325 - I've been told that it's quitebig.\\
326 - [Walden chuckles]\\
327 - Wait, wait, we're not really talking about the house, are we?\\
328 - No, no, we're not.Oh. [laughs]\\
329 - Yay!\\
330 - It's big.\\
331 - Would you like a tour?\\
332 - I think that is an excellent idea!\\
333 - [Walden mumbles]\\
334 - [laughs]Oh, um,\\
335 - by the way, my name's...Up, bup, bup, bup, bup.\\
336 - No names.\\
337 - Today we are just two\\
338 - wild elk... [exhales]\\
339 - on the frozen tundra.\\
340 - Ooh, elk. I can do that.\\
341 - [high-pitched]: Eee-ohh!\\
342 - I don't know what's weirder,\\
343 - that noise or the fact that it turned me on.[laughs]\\
344 -     Men.   \\
345 -     Men.   \\
346 - Hey, sorry about that.\\
347 - Where's my client?\\
348 - [exhales]\\
349 - How do I say this, exactly?\\
350 - I had sex with your client.\\
351 - What?!\\
352 - I know. And it's not the first one.\\
353 - My therapist prescribed that I have meaningless sex\\
354 - to take care of my codependency issues.\\
355 - Oh, my God!\\
356 - I know. I'm sorry.\\
357 - Well, look, look, obviously, you know,\\
358 - I can't... condone this kind of behavior.\\
359 - But, you know, if you... if you think it's...\\
360 - helping you, I mean, that's really the important thing.\\
361 - It is helping. I feel so free.\\
362 - Do you know what it's like to have sex\\
363 - with a woman who never wants to see you again?\\
364 - Yes.\\
365 - Yes, I do.\\
366 - I appreciate you understanding,\\
367 - but I'm sure that this has taken a toll on your business.\\
368 - I... Here.\\
369 - Here's... $200.\\
370 - Oh, oh, no, you don't have to do that, Walden.No, no.\\
371 - Take it.No, I'm not taking your money, Walden.\\
372 - I insist.No, no, no.\\
373 - [chuckles]Okay, fine.\\
374 - Thank you.\\
375 -     You know, it's hard out here for a pimp    \\
376 -     When he trying to get this money for the rent    \\
377 -     For the Cadillacs and gas money spent    \\
378 -     'Cause a whole lot of ... jumping ship    \\
379 -     You know, it's hard out here for a pimp    \\
380 -     When he trying to get this money for the rent    \\
381 -     For the Cadillacs and gas money spent    \\
382 -     'Cause a whole lot of ... jumping ship    \\
383 -     In my eyes, I done seen some crazy thangs in the street...    \\
384 -        \\
385 - Hey.\\
386 - Think I have another one for you.\\
387 - I don't know, I think I'm over the whole one-night stand thing.\\
388 - Come on.\\
389 - You said you wanted\\
390 - to get into the casual sex game.\\
391 - I got you into the game.\\
392 - Now you're telling me you're tired?\\
393 - The game doesn't work like that.\\
394 - Even if I wanted to, I'm not sure that I could.\\
395 - My penis looks like one of those dried-out 7-Eleven hot dogs.\\
396 - Look, I'm not gonna twist your arm or...\\
397 - break a finger or anything.\\
398 - Bottom line, I just want you to be happy, baby.\\
399 - Okay, what-what is the matter with you?\\
400 - Why are you massaging me and calling me "baby"\\
401 - and dressed like a gay cheetah?\\
402 - Don't hate the cheetah.\\
403 - Hate the game.\\
404 - Okay, you know what?\\
405 - I'm gonna go talk to this woman.\\
406 - Mostly 'cause I don't want to talk to youanymore.\\
407 - Attaboy. Oh, oh, hang on a second.\\
408 - Um...\\
409 - okay, uh...\\
410 - Okay. Now go have fun.\\
411 -     Men.   \\
412 - Oh... my... God.\\
413 - That was fantastic.\\
414 - Your partner was right-- you're the best.\\
415 - [chuckles]: Partner? What are you talking about?\\
416 - The weird little guy downstairs.\\
417 - [chuckling]: Oh, that...\\
418 - He's not my partner.\\
419 - Oh. Gotcha.\\
420 - Anyway, uh, don't share this with your...\\
421 - "not partner."\\
422 - Wink, wink.\\
423 - What's this?\\
424 - Oh, just a little tip.\\
425 - For the big one you gave me.\\
426 - Y-You don't have to give me a tip.\\
427 - Yeah, right. Like I didn't have to pay the guy downstairs\\
428 - for the "Walden Package."\\
429 - You... you paid him?\\
430 - It was worth every penny.\\
431 - Alan!\\
432 - Oh, by the way, I think you might be the one.\\
433 - WALDEN [calls]: Alan!\\
434 - I'm your whore?\\
435 - Your whore?!\\
436 - Oh. What? No!\\
437 - I mean, "whore" is such an ugly word\\
438 - for such a pretty man.\\
439 - How could you!\\
440 - You knew I was using desperate, horny housewives\\
441 - for meaningless sex to improve myself,\\
442 - and you had to go and turn it into something ugly!\\
443 - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It just sort of happened by accident.\\
444 - It was a one-time thing, and then you turned into the goose\\
445 - that laid the golden eggs, and then into the goose\\
446 - that laid whatever the hell I told it to.\\
447 - This is a new low, even for you.\\
448 - Oh, big words coming from someone having sex for money.\\
449 - Alan...\\
450 - Yeah?\\
451 - Run.\\
452 - [thud, grunt]\\
453 - ALAN: Ow! My pimp hand!\\
454 -     Men.   \\
455 -     Men.   [doorbell rings]\\
456 - Hello?\\
457 - Hi. Is this Adjustments by the Sea?\\
458 - Yeah. But, uh, actually, we're closed.\\
459 - Oh, that's such a shame.\\
460 - 'Cause I was really hoping\\
461 - to see Walden.\\
462 - Oh, I'm Walden. Please come in.\\
463 - Hey...\\
464 - um, just to be clear,\\
465 - the way this works is that I pay you money\\
466 - and in return you have sex with me?\\
467 - Yes.\\
468 - [whispers]: By the sea!\\
469 - All righty, then, I have heard all I need to hear.\\
470 - [laughs]: Okay. Are you... ready to start?\\
471 - Oh, yes. But first,\\
472 - you have the right to remain silent.\\
473 - And you have the right to make as much noise as you want.\\
474 - Anything you say can and will be held against you.\\
475 - I'd like to hold those against me.\\
476 - Oh.\\
477 - [laughing]: Oh, kinky. Okay.\\
478 - You're being arrested.\\
479 - Yes, I am-- by your captivating gaze.\\
480 - Oh, wait, I'm-I'm really being arrested?\\
481 - Yeah.Oh, oh, God, no, no,\\
482 - we-we can work this out.\\
483 - I-I have money.\\
484 - Walden, Walden, help me.\\
485 - Walden! Okay, wait,\\
486 - j-just to be clear, we're not having sex, right?\\
487 - When are you gonna tell him that was my acting coach?\\
488 - Probably after the cavity search.\\
489 - By the sea!\\

1 -     Men.   \\
2 - Are you eating cookie dough?\\
3 - Yup. It's my favorite recipe.\\
4 - All you need is cookie dough and weed.\\
5 - So the only thing you have to bake is yourself.\\
6 - It's very efficient.\\
7 - It causes the munchies and then immediately cures them.\\
8 - [computer chimes]Hey.\\
9 - What do you know? They found my car.\\
10 - You lost your car?\\
11 - What the hell's your cookie dough laced with?\\
12 - No, I found this company\\
13 - and they help you locate old vehicles.\\
14 - It's called Dude, Where's My Car?\\
15 - So what's so great about this thing?\\
16 - I don't know. It's my first car. I got a lot of firsts in it.\\
17 - First time I learned to drive.\\
18 - First time I had sex.\\
19 - First time I had a condom break.\\
20 - First time I prayed.\\
21 - So you gonna buy this car?\\
22 - No. Some guy named Dirk in Denver has it.\\
23 - So why go through all the effort\\
24 - of tracking it down if you don't want it?\\
25 - Nostalgia?\\
26 - It's kind of like...\\
27 - looking up your first girlfriend,\\
28 - or your high school math teacher.\\
29 - For me, those were one and the same.\\
30 - She still writes me from prison.\\
31 - I think my math teacher had a crush on my me, too.\\
32 - I mean, why else would he ask me to take a shower\\
33 - after math team practice?\\
34 - Oh, oh, good, everybody's here.\\
35 - Uh, I would now like to introduce my girlfriend,\\
36 - the very fetchin' Gretchen.\\
37 - Hey, everybody.\\
38 - Hi, I'm Walden. It's nice\\
39 - to finally meet you.Yeah.\\
40 - Alan, uh, told me that you work\\
41 - in an animal shelter taking in strays.\\
42 - So we have a lot in common.\\
43 - Yeah.\\
44 - Uh, this is my-my niece Jenny.\\
45 - Hi. Hi.\\
46 - And we met.\\
47 - I'm Barry, Walden's youthful ward.\\
48 - It's really nice to meet all of you.\\
49 - God, this place is amazing.\\
50 - How do you afford the rent, Alan?\\
51 - [laughs]\\
52 - What's so funny?\\
53 - Well, I-I don't pay rent, per se.\\
54 - Or per month.\\
55 - Or per year.\\
56 - Really? No rent?\\
57 - How long has that been going on?\\
58 - Three years with Walden, eight years with my dad.\\
59 - You have been living here for 11 years for free?\\
60 - Yeah.\\
61 - I have never wanted you more.\\
62 - [chuckles]\\
63 - Who's my cheap daddy?\\
64 - Would you like to see the bedroom I don't pay for?\\
65 - Would you like to see my boobs I bought with a Groupon?\\
66 - Will you let me get my grope on?\\
67 - Nice to meet you, Gretchen. Make yourself at home.\\
68 - I've got to stop saying that.\\
69 - So, what do you say we hop on your plane,\\
70 - head over to Denver and at least look at this car?\\
71 - You know you want to.\\
72 - You guys just want to go to Colorado\\
73 - 'cause pot is legal there.\\
74 - What? It's-It's legal?\\
75 - They legalized marijuana in Colorado?\\
76 - You say up to three ounces?\\
77 - Look, we're not going to Denver to look at a car\\
78 - and bring home three ounces of pot.\\
79 - Yeah, but if we go with you,\\
80 - we can bring back nine ounces.\\
81 - Fire up the jet.\\
82 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
83 -     Ah.         Men.         Men.    \\
84 -     Men.   \\
85 - Well, guess who just joined the Mile High Club.\\
86 - No, it doesn't count when you do it alone.\\
87 - Oh, it counted... twice.\\
88 - Up top.\\
89 - No!\\
90 - Not gonna happen.\\
91 - This is crazy.\\
92 - There's no way my old car is worth the cost\\
93 - of flying all the way to Denver and putting in a new bathroom.\\
94 - We can't turn back now.\\
95 - I canceled an audition for this trip.\\
96 - You're kidding, right?\\
97 - The part was Dead Junkie Number Two.\\
98 - Although, I did buy painkillers to get into character.\\
99 - It doesn't matter what the role is.\\
100 - This job leads to the next,\\
101 - and you're playing Dead Junkie Number One.\\
102 - And before you know it, you're playing a live junkie!\\
103 - And then what?\\
104 - Win a bunch of Oscars,\\
105 - get rich, fly around on a private plane?\\
106 - Oh, look, I skipped to the end!\\
107 - So what kind of car are we going to look at?\\
108 - You can thank me later for changing the subject.\\
109 - It's a 1967 Mustang\\
110 - with a 289 V-8, a Holley four-barrel carb\\
111 - and Positraction.\\
112 - [whistles]\\
113 - What does that mean?\\
114 - I have no idea. My dad used to say it all the time\\
115 - when we were working on the car.\\
116 - I like to think that it\\
117 - was one of his ways of saying, "I love you."\\
118 - Another was, "Why is Daddy's beer empty?"\\
119 - I totally get it.\\
120 - My dad's coded "I love you" was, "Seriously?\\
121 - You can't catch a football one damn time?"\\
122 - [chuckles]\\
123 - So you worked on this with your dad.\\
124 - Apparently, there's an emotional connection with this car.\\
125 - It's a mixed emotion.\\
126 - It took us two years to restore it.\\
127 - When it was finished, it was cherry.\\
128 - Of course, Cherry was also the name of the stripper\\
129 - that he drove off with when he left me and my mom.\\
130 - Wait-- so why would you want to buy something\\
131 - that caused you so much pain?\\
132 - I mean, that'd be like me buying the senior prom.\\
133 - It was on my 16th birthday.\\
134 - I go outside the house... and there's that car\\
135 - sitting in the driveway.\\
136 - No sign of my dad, though.\\
137 - It was still the best birthday ever.\\
138 - Well, until my mom took a baseball bat to the windshield.\\
139 - You know what my dad got me for my 16th birthday?\\
140 - A box of condoms and a card that said,\\
141 - "Don't make the same mistake I did."\\
142 - He was a joker.\\
143 - How about you, Jenny?\\
144 - Oh, she would've nailed Dead Junkie Number Two!\\
145 -     Men.   \\
146 - Oh! What a great idea:\\
147 - having sex in every room in the house.\\
148 - Well, to be fair, the laundry room was more you\\
149 - sitting on the dryer while I took a breather.\\
150 - Yeah. Next time, I think\\
151 - I'm gonna throw in a pair of snow boots.\\
152 - You know, boom-boom-boom- boom-boom! Yeah.\\
153 - One of the advantages of being here alone.\\
154 - Kind of makes a man want to buy a place of his own.\\
155 - [both laugh]\\
156 - Nah, I'm gonna die here, I really am.\\
157 - So, uh, what do you want to do tonight?\\
158 - You know, besides this guy.\\
159 - I would love to spend the night doing this guy,\\
160 - but we promised Lyndsey and Larry we'd meet 'em.\\
161 - Remember, karaoke?\\
162 - Oh, that's right.\\
163 - Oh, hey, hey, maybe we can use\\
164 - my Halloween costumes from last year.\\
165 - You know, Donny and Marie?\\
166 - Although I'm not sure you'd fit into Walden's Donny outfit.\\
167 - You know, I was thinking tonight would be a great time\\
168 - to tell Larry that you're not Jeff Strongman,\\
169 - that you're really Alan Harper.\\
170 - Oh, that's funny because I was thinking\\
171 - tonight might be a great night to not ruin four people's lives.\\
172 - He's my brother, Alan.\\
173 - I can't just keep lying to him.\\
174 - I lied to my brother all the time. It worked out great.\\
175 - Your brother's dead.\\
176 - I didn't say it worked out great for everybody.\\
177 -     Men.   \\
178 - [plays discordant chord]\\
179 - Hey!\\
180 - Are you Dirk?\\
181 - Are you a cop?\\
182 - No. Then I'm Dirk.\\
183 - I'm Walden Schmidt. I called about the car.\\
184 - Actually, on the phone, you asked if I was a cop.\\
185 - And then you asked me if I wanted to buy any weed.\\
186 - Yeah, that's the right order to ask those questions.\\
187 - I learned that the hard way.\\
188 - These your kids?\\
189 - [snickers]\\
190 - No.\\
191 - Are they mine?\\
192 - Hey, uh, is this the car?\\
193 - Yeah, let me take her top off for you.\\
194 - You're about to see one hot car.\\
195 - Where, behind this piece of crap?\\
196 - She's not that pretty, but she gets the job done.\\
197 - Just like my old lady.\\
198 - Hey, that's not bad.\\
199 -     She's not that pretty, but she gets the job done    \\
200 -     I'd like to escape, but I'm too old to run!    \\
201 - Yeah, that's a hit!\\
202 - So is this your car?\\
203 - Yeah.\\
204 - It's still got the Vote For Bush bumper sticker on it.\\
205 - You were a Republican?\\
206 - No, my friends and I just thought it was funny.\\
207 - You know, "Bush"?\\
208 - Tell you what, I love Bush.\\
209 - You and me both.\\
210 - She's got a lot of wear and tear on her.\\
211 - Not much to look at.\\
212 - Looks like it was rear-ended.\\
213 - Just like my old lady.\\
214 - But she's got new headlights and a roomy backseat.\\
215 - Just like your old lady?\\
216 - Hey! That's the mother of three of my five kids!\\
217 - Anyway, this bad boy can still get up to a buck ten.\\
218 - Yeah, maybe if the truck towing it was going 110.\\
219 - You don't believe me, I refer you\\
220 - to World's Wildest Police Chases,episode 139.\\
221 - Whoa, what died in here?\\
222 - My granddad.\\
223 - The seat belt got jammed, we had to\\
224 - leave him in there for a couple of days.\\
225 - Okay, well, hey, thank you for showing us the car.\\
226 - Whoa, hang on, hang on.\\
227 - How much do you want for it?\\
228 - Uh, uh, uh, what are you doing?\\
229 - I'll take $1,800 unless you can\\
230 - come up with some kind of other arrangement.\\
231 - Ew!\\
232 - How about you?\\
233 - No!\\
234 - $1,800 it is, then.\\
235 - I'm not... I'm not buying this car.\\
236 - Walden, this car is a piece of your life.\\
237 - It doesn't mean anything to anybody else\\
238 - in the world except you.\\
239 - All right, I'll give you $1,800.\\
240 - Dude, you didn't haggle. It's no good unless you haggle.\\
241 - Okay, uh, fine. $1,600.\\
242 - $1,700.\\
243 - Deal. $1,700.\\
244 - Yeah!\\
245 - I was just gonna give you $1,800.\\
246 - That's the thing about haggling, dude.\\
247 - Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.\\
248 - We definitely have to get some of this guy's weed.\\
249 -     Men.   \\
250 -     Hey, will you love me forever?    \\
251 -     Let me sleep on it    \\
252 -     Will you love me forever?    \\
253 -     Let me sleep on it    \\
254 -     Will you love me forever?    \\
255 -     I couldn't take it any longer    \\
256 -     Lord, I was crazed    \\
257 -     And then the feeling came upon me like a tidal wave    \\
258 -     I started swearing to my God on my mother's grave    \\
259 -     That I would love you till the end of time    \\
260 -     I swore I'd love you till the end of time!    \\
261 - Yeah!\\
262 - Gretchen, Jeff!\\
263 - Follow that, bitches.\\
264 - Come on, Lyndsey, it's our turn.\\
265 -     Who let the dogs out?    \\
266 - Woof, woof. Woof, woof.\\
267 - Come on. You can do better than that.\\
268 - Larry, do I look like I want to do better than that?\\
269 - Ooh, last time I saw that face,\\
270 - I forgot to pick up wine.\\
271 - Boy, was I in the doghouse\\
272 - that night. Hey!\\
273 -     Who's in the doghouse?    \\
274 -     Who-who-who-who?    \\
275 - That's what I'm talking about!\\
276 - Come on. Let's show 'em how\\
277 - you and your brother do it doggy style.\\
278 - He doesn't really hear himself, does he?\\
279 - Why are you here?\\
280 - I've told you a hundred times, I don't want\\
281 - to double-date with Gretchen and Jeff Strongman.\\
282 - Well, you won't have to anymore.\\
283 - Guess who's gonna tell Larry the truth tonight.\\
284 -     Who-who-who-who?    \\
285 - What do you mean?\\
286 - I told Gretchen who I really am.\\
287 - I was tired of living a lie\\
288 - and sneaking around, being dishonest.\\
289 - I'm better than that.\\
290 - She caught you.\\
291 - Yes. Yes, she did.\\
292 - But it felt good to get it off my chest.\\
293 - If you tell Larry who you really are,\\
294 - then he's gonna wonder why I didn't tell him.\\
295 - And that's not something I want to deal with\\
296 - less than two weeks before we're supposed to get married.\\
297 - God, is it two weeks?\\
298 - Boy, I better find those rings.\\
299 - Alan, you're not gonna say a thing about\\
300 - who you really are.\\
301 - I'm sorry, but I already promised Gretchen.\\
302 - And-and the fact of the matter is\\
303 - you and I aren't in a relationship anymore,\\
304 - so you no longer have me by the balls!\\
305 -     Men.   \\
306 -     Dial 1-900-mix-a-lot and kick them nasty thoughts    \\
307 -     Baby got back!    \\
308 - [cheering]\\
309 - Come on, Larry, let's show 'em how we do it.\\
310 - There you go!\\
311 - Menstrual cramps can't stop my lady!\\
312 - It's Larry-oke time!\\
313 -     Ow! I feel good    \\
314 -     I knew that I would now    \\
315 - So, did you talk to Larry yet?\\
316 - Uh, well, you know, I was, I was running\\
317 - this whole thing by Lyndsey, and, um...\\
318 - Whoa, wait. Why would you run it by Lyndsey?\\
319 - You know, she is the one getting married,\\
320 - and I didn't want to spring it on her\\
321 - because Lyndsey is not the girl you want to get angry\\
322 - unless you're about to have sex with her,\\
323 - 'cause then she turns into a freak,\\
324 - and I don't know why I'm saying this.\\
325 - I know why.\\
326 - Because you still have feelings for her.\\
327 - [scoffs] That's crazy. I just, I think\\
328 - it's the right thing to do, that's all.\\
329 - Oh, my God.\\
330 - That is why you invented Jeff Strongman\\
331 - in the first place, was to win Lyndsey back.\\
332 - Feelings like that don't just disappear.\\
333 - Sure, they do. There's a lot of things\\
334 - I used to love that I don't love anymore:\\
335 - uh, roller coasters, dairy, my mother.\\
336 - This isn't funny, Alan.\\
337 - Well, I-I was just saying...\\
338 - No, listen to me.\\
339 - Look, if you want to run everything by your ex-girlfriend\\
340 - and not tell Larry the truth, then so be it.\\
341 - But I don't want anything to do with it. Or you.Wait, Gretchen...\\
342 - Gretchen. Gretchen, wait!\\
343 -     I feel good    \\
344 -     I knew that I would now    \\
345 - Come on, Jeff, you know the words.\\
346 -     So good, so good    \\
347 -     I'm gonna die alone    \\
348 -     Ow!    \\
349 -     Men.   \\
350 - Aren't you glad I made you do this?\\
351 - Yeah. Having d  j   vu.\\
352 - My dad used to let me sit on his lap and steer.\\
353 - Yeah, my dad wasn't around much.\\
354 - I had to teach myself all those things that dads teach you:\\
355 - how to ride a bike, how to shave,\\
356 - how to change a tire, how to masturbate.\\
357 - What?\\
358 - No, dads don't teach you how to masturbate.\\
359 - I'm glad somebody told me before I had kids.\\
360 - This thing is actually really cool.\\
361 - What made you sell it in the first place?\\
362 - I needed the seed money to start my company,\\
363 - and it's the only thing I had that was worth anything.\\
364 - You know, when you think about it,\\
365 - this car is really responsible for everything I have:\\
366 - the beach house, my jet and my fortune.\\
367 - Alan.\\
368 - Shh, she didn't mean it. It's not true.\\
369 - So that means your dad is kind of responsible\\
370 - for your success, too, doesn't it?\\
371 - I never really thought of it like that.\\
372 - I guess he is.\\
373 - Thanks, Dad.\\
374 - Oh, that gave me the chills.\\
375 - Oh! No, wait.\\
376 - There's a hole in the floorboard.\\
377 - Anybody else want to drive for a while?\\
378 - I don't know how to drive.\\
379 - What?\\
380 - I grew up in Manhattan.\\
381 - I've been in taxis and cop cars.\\
382 - Ooh, this is my first time in the front seat!\\
383 - Well, there's no time like the present.\\
384 - [all screaming]\\
385 - I'm gonna pull in here.\\
386 - I'm pretty sure they sell underwear at Cracker Barrel.\\
387 -     Men.   \\
388 - Berta?\\
389 - Hey, Zippy.\\
390 - It's 10:00.\\
391 - What are you still doing here?\\
392 - It's 11 years later.\\
393 - What are you still doing here?\\
394 - Where's your girlfriend?\\
395 - Gone. I think I lost her.\\
396 - You mean "lost" like you broke up\\
397 - or "lost" like the time Charlie took Jake to Disneyland?\\
398 - Broke up. Wait-- Charlie lost Jake?\\
399 - Actually, Jake lost Charlie.\\
400 - Security found him.\\
401 - He was doing white snow with Snow White.\\
402 - So, um,\\
403 - what did you do to drive this girlfriend away?\\
404 - She thinks I'm still in love with Lyndsey,\\
405 - which I'm not, but she doesn't believe me.\\
406 - Well, make her believe you.\\
407 - You can make anybody believe anything.\\
408 - You made the IRS believe you had seven dependents.\\
409 - That's true.\\
410 - I went to chiropractic college on an NAACP scholarship.\\
411 - Exactly.\\
412 - And you made those people at the movie theater\\
413 - believe that you were under 14.\\
414 - And over 65.\\
415 - Once on the same day.\\
416 - [laughs]\\
417 - The, uh, the secret is that both of those groups wear\\
418 - little baseball caps. [laughs]\\
419 - I was saving this for your funeral,\\
420 - but, Zippy, you're a charmer.\\
421 - Thanks, Berta.\\
422 - No. Thank you.\\
423 - Now I don't have to go to your funeral.\\
424 -     Men.   \\
425 - Wow,\\
426 - this Utah sky is amazing.\\
427 - We're indoors.\\
428 - Wow, this Colorado weed is amazing.\\
429 - Guess who just joined the 6,106-foot club.\\
430 - It doesn't count when you do it alone!\\
431 - Whatever.\\
432 - I don't like it here.\\
433 - There's no Wi-Fi or cell service.\\
434 - It's like one of those movies where you find out\\
435 - the little town's full of zombies.\\
436 - Or werewolves.\\
437 - Or zombie werewolves.\\
438 - How would that happen?\\
439 - Hello. Do the math.\\
440 - Zombie bites a werewolf,\\
441 - werewolf dies, comes back as a werewolf zombie.\\
442 - That's a badass, unkillable creature.\\
443 - He's right. Chain the door.\\
444 - Wait a second. You think chaining the door\\
445 - is gonna stop a zombie werewolf?\\
446 - I'll tell you what, I'm not gonna be the guy\\
447 - who gets killed by a zombie werewolf\\
448 - 'cause I didn't chain the door.\\
449 - [laughs] Hey...\\
450 - thanks for coming with me, guys.\\
451 - And I'm not just saying that\\
452 - 'cause I can use you as human shields\\
453 - when the zombie werewolf breaks in the door.\\
454 - Yeah, I'm really glad we came, too.\\
455 - And about almost killing you guys\\
456 - in the car earlier-- that's my bad.\\
457 - Yeah, well, I am glad\\
458 - that Cracker Barrel had underwear.\\
459 - And these "I Heart Denver" sweatpants.\\
460 - You know, this is still better than that family trip\\
461 - I took to Utah as a kid.\\
462 - My dad was trying to convince my mom\\
463 - to add another wife to the family.\\
464 - Started the trip with one wife,\\
465 - tried to get two, came home with zero.\\
466 - Hotel had a great pool, though.\\
467 - At least you knew your dad.\\
468 - I barely knew Charlie.\\
469 - I got one letter from him my entire childhood.\\
470 - It said, "Are your friends 18 yet?"\\
471 - Yeah, hearing you guys talk about your dads,\\
472 - and thinking about mine,\\
473 - makes me question even wanting to have kids.\\
474 - You already have kids.\\
475 - [Walden laughs]\\
476 - Papa.\\
477 - Come on. I'm not your dad.\\
478 - You've been a better dad to me than anybody ever has.\\
479 - You-you-you took me in,\\
480 - you inspired me to be a better person.\\
481 - You pushed me to be a dead junkie.\\
482 - I really want that for you, too.\\
483 - She's right, man. You're a role model.\\
484 - I mean, you believe that\\
485 - I can make something out of myself\\
486 - and you stopped me from going to prison\\
487 - for teaching my son how to masturbate.\\
488 - That's right. You want to be a hands-on dad,\\
489 - but not too hands-on.\\
490 - Hey, bring it in, kiddos.\\
491 - Oh! Aw...\\
492 - [laughs]\\
493 - Oh, Dad?Hmm?\\
494 - Barry's got his hand on my butt again.\\
495 - It's not my hand. Okay.\\
496 - All right.\\
497 -     Men.   \\
498 - [doorbell rings]\\
499 - Hey, Gretchie.\\
500 - I don't want to talk to you right now.\\
501 - Gretchen's still mad at you, but I'm on your side, Jeff.\\
502 - Bros before hoes.\\
503 - Oh, uh, oh, good, you're, uh, you're all here.\\
504 - Because I have something to say...\\
505 - to everyone.\\
506 - Are you sure, Jeff?\\
507 - Some things are better left unsaid.\\
508 - I love you so much,\\
509 - I-I can't imagine my life without you.\\
510 - Just stop.\\
511 - Maybe this will help.\\
512 - Okay, I appreciate the gesture,\\
513 - but looking for change together isn't gonna work this time.\\
514 - The only change I want is for us to be husband and wife.\\
515 - ALL: What?!\\
516 - Gretchen Martin, will you do me the honor\\
517 - of becoming Mrs. Alan Harper?\\
518 - Oh, my God! My sister and my best...\\
519 - Wait a minute. Who the hell is Alan Harper?\\
520 - Larry, look, boobs!\\
521 -     Men.   \\
522 -     Men.   \\
523 - Oh, look at you. You're doing great.\\
524 - You haven't hit a guardrail in miles.\\
525 - Once you get the hang of it,\\
526 - this driving thing isn't so tough.\\
527 - How about after I restore it, I give it to you?\\
528 - What? You love this car.\\
529 - I've gotten what I need out of it,\\
530 - and I'd rather have it stay in the family.\\
531 - Who better to have it than my my...\\
532 - sort-of-daughter.\\
533 - Aw! You're the best sort-of-dad ever!\\
534 - Whoa! Hands on the wheel!\\
535 - Hands on the wheel![tires squealing]\\
536 - Whoa!Why are you yelling at me?\\
537 - You should be yelling at them\\
538 - for driving on the wrong side...\\

\subsection {Episode 22: Oh WALD-E Good Times Ahead}
1 - Previously on...\\
2 - Tonight would be a great time\\
3 - to tell Larry that you're not Jeff Strongman,\\
4 - that you're really Alan Harper.\\
5 - If you tell Larry who you really are,\\
6 - then he's gonna wonder why Ididn't tell him.\\
7 - Will you do me the honor of becoming Mrs. Alan Harper?\\
8 - Who the hell is Alan Harper?\\
9 - Larry! Look! Boobs!\\
10 -     Men.   \\
11 - We can go in the other room and you can play with them. Huh?\\
12 - Really? In the middle of the day?Mm-hmm.\\
13 - Wait a minute. Who's Alan Harper?\\
14 - Uh, I am gonna answer that, but before I do...\\
15 - What do you say, Gretchie?\\
16 - Will you marry me?\\
17 - Yes.\\
18 - [laughs]: Oh, my God!\\
19 - You've made me the-the happiest man in the world.\\
20 - Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry.\\
21 - A-And for your question, Larry,\\
22 - I just want to say that everything you've known about me\\
23 - is a lie.\\
24 - My real name is Alan.\\
25 - That's okay. My real name is Lawrence.\\
26 - All right, this is gonna be a lot harder than I thought.\\
27 - Um, uh, Lyndsey\\
28 - is my ex-girlfriend. When you and she\\
29 - got together, I made up a fake name\\
30 - so that I could meet you and stay close to Lyndsey.\\
31 - But then it turns out I actually like you\\
32 - more than I like Lyndsey.\\
33 - I like you more than Lyndsey, too!\\
34 - What the hell is happening here?!\\
35 - So your name's not really Jeff Strongman,\\
36 - it's Alan Harper, and you used to date Lyndsey?\\
37 - For four years.\\
38 - Did you know about this?\\
39 - Yes. He was my boyfriend.\\
40 - But-but I'm with younow, and only you.\\
41 - A-And I'm really, really sorry.\\
42 - Oh, save it, Jeff-- if that's even your real name.\\
43 - I think I made it pretty clear it's not, but o-okay.\\
44 - I told Alan that I thought he should tell you the truth,\\
45 - because I thought you deserved to know.\\
46 - How could you keep this from me?\\
47 - I would never lie to you. This is unbelievable!\\
48 - I never wanted any of this to happen.\\
49 - Well, it did-- and now I've lost my two best friends.\\
50 - And this time I'm not talking about your boobs.\\
51 - I don't want to see either one of you again.\\
52 - And I'm still not talking about your boobs!\\
53 - The wedding's off!\\
54 - Larry, wait!\\
55 - Oh, God, see?\\
56 - This is exactly why I didn't want to tell him.\\
57 - Now both Lyndsey andLarry hate me,\\
58 - and I've ruined the lives of two wonderful people.\\
59 - I'll never forget the look on-- ooh, boobs.\\
60 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
61 -     Ah.         Men.         Men.    \\
62 -     Men.   \\
63 - [like Scarface]: Say hello to my little friend.\\
64 - What is that?\\
65 - Thisis the most advanced\\
66 - robotic artificial intelligence today.\\
67 - I call him WALD-E.\\
68 - Get it?\\
69 - 'Cause I'm Walden,\\
70 - and the movie WALL-E?\\
71 - WALD-E? [chuckles]\\
72 - Say hello to my friend Jenny.\\
73 - [robotic voice]: Hello to my friend Jenny.\\
74 - I programmed him to be funny.\\
75 - I beg to differ.\\
76 - You're just jealous 'cause you don't have\\
77 - an electronic friend to play with.\\
78 - Trust me, I have a whole drawer\\
79 - of electronic friends I can play with.\\
80 - Then maybe we can have a zero-one-one-way.\\
81 - That's a three-way in binary.\\
82 - [laughs]: Oh, WALD-E, good times ahead.\\
83 - Hey.\\
84 - Oh. Hey, check out my new robot.\\
85 - I detect no sign of intelligent life.\\
86 - I'm not in the mood for this. Can you turn him off?\\
87 - Can you turn himoff?\\
88 - I wish I could, WALD-E, I wish I could.\\
89 - What's going on?Larry just texted me.\\
90 - He wants to see me. What do you think he wants?\\
91 - Well,\\
92 - given the fact you blew up his entire life,\\
93 - I'm guessing he either wants to kick your ass,\\
94 - orrip your face off so you can watchhim kick your ass.\\
95 - Oh, this is all my fault.\\
96 - I should have just been honest\\
97 - and told the truth right from the start-- lying is\\
98 - never the answer.\\
99 - Ooh, I know, I'll tell him I'm sick.\\
100 - What's a trendy illness?\\
101 - Alan, you have to man up\\
102 - and face the consequences of your actions.\\
103 - [groans] Maybe you're right.\\
104 - I at least owe him that much.\\
105 - I'll just go and... Hah-choo!\\
106 - Oh! Oh. Oh.\\
107 - Alan?Mm-hmm?\\
108 - When people sneeze, they don't say, "Hah-choo,\\
109 - oh, ew, ooh."\\
110 - Okay, fine.\\
111 - But when he beats me within an inch of my life,\\
112 - you're on bedpan duty.\\
113 - Okay, if it makes you feel better, I'll come with you.\\
114 - JENNY [scoffs]: He only wants to go so when Larry beats you up,\\
115 - he can say, "I told you so."\\
116 - That is not true.\\
117 - Even though I repeatedly\\
118 - told him to stop lying about who he was,\\
119 - and deceiving the people around him,\\
120 - and eventually it would blow up in his face,\\
121 - I'm not going to say, "I told you so."\\
122 - Well, I appreciate that.\\
123 - I want to film Larry kicking his ass\\
124 - and then say, "I told you so."\\
125 -     Men.   \\
126 - Hey, Alan.\\
127 - Oh, hey, hey, Larry!\\
128 - I don't have a weapon.\\
129 - Hi. I'm Walden,\\
130 - Alan's friend.\\
131 - Uh, just act like I'm not here,\\
132 - and punch like no one's watchin'.\\
133 - And...\\
134 - action.\\
135 - So, you, uh, you said\\
136 - you wanted to talk?\\
137 - No, no, no, louder.\\
138 - I'm sorry. What?\\
139 - Louder. There's a lot of ambient noise in here.\\
140 - [loudly]: So, so, you said you wanted to talk?\\
141 - [loudly]: Yeah, I actually came here to tell you that I forgive you!\\
142 - No! Cut! Cut!\\
143 - What's... Wait, wait, you forgivehim?\\
144 - Yeah, I realized all this anger isn't good.\\
145 - I had to let it all go.\\
146 - No!\\
147 - He's not gonna learn his lesson\\
148 - if you forgive him. The only way he's gonna learn\\
149 - a lesson is through pain and suffering\\
150 - and possibly losing a tooth.\\
151 - No, no. He's gonna be my brother-in-law\\
152 - and make an honest woman out of Gretchen.\\
153 - [chuckling]: She's not gonna be an honest woman on our wedding night.\\
154 - That's the guy I know and love who's banging my sister.\\
155 - I do love banging your sister.\\
156 - [laughing]\\
157 - No, the only banging I want to see is you banging his face!\\
158 - Oh,\\
159 - that didn't come out right.\\
160 - Gretchen is the most amazing woman I've ever met.\\
161 - I-I just have to scrape together enough money for the wedding.\\
162 - Oh, I know what you mean-- mine and Lyndsey's\\
163 - was costing me a fortune.\\
164 - I already paid for the flowers, the cake, the tux.\\
165 - Too bad you can't just take hiswedding.\\
166 - Or can I?\\
167 - I was kidding.\\
168 - Well, why not? I mean, this cup says "Peter" on it,\\
169 - but Peter wasn't there to get it.\\
170 - I'm not gonna use it. Me and Lyndsey are through,\\
171 - so you might as well.\\
172 - You can't mooch a wedding\\
173 - that you just destroyed.\\
174 - [laughs]: I know. How great is that?\\
175 - Classic Alan Harper.\\
176 - Jeff Strongman.\\
177 - Mm.I don't know how I didn't see through it sooner.\\
178 - It's such an obviously made-up name.\\
179 - Yeah.Jeff.\\
180 -     Men.   \\
181 - Mom, this is my fianc  e, Gretchen Martin.\\
182 - It is so nice to finally meet you, Evelyn.\\
183 - Oh, you, too, dear.\\
184 - How far along areyou?\\
185 - What?Uh, my mother assumes that\\
186 - since you agreed to marry me, you must be pregnant.\\
187 - [laughs]: No, I'm not pregnant.\\
188 - Are you after my money?Of course not.\\
189 -   Estas buscando trabajo en el mundo nuevo?\\
190 - What?\\
191 - Not looking for a green card, either.\\
192 - You must genuinely like Alan.Yeah.\\
193 - This is uncharted territory for me.\\
194 - I know. She actually loves me for me.\\
195 - I mean, I had to pretend to be another person\\
196 - to make it all happen, but still.\\
197 - Oh, that is somering you bought her.\\
198 - Oh, actually, that's the ring my ex-husband got me.\\
199 - But I still had it-- I figured why make Alan buy another one?\\
200 - My God, you've found your soul mate.\\
201 - I know. Our honeymoon is at her cousin's time-share.\\
202 - He can't use it, 'cause he had a heart attack.\\
203 - We're so blessed.\\
204 - Speaking of blessings,\\
205 - I just want to thank you for raising such a caring,\\
206 - thoughtful, intelligent son.\\
207 - [chuckling]\\
208 - Oh, you're serious.\\
209 - So, when's the big day?\\
210 - Oh, uh, it's next Saturday.\\
211 - We're just gonna have a small affair here at the house.\\
212 - We're trying to keep costs down.\\
213 - Are your parents coming?\\
214 - Oh, no, my parents have passed away.\\
215 - Again, we're so blessed.\\
216 - So, where are you planning on living after you marry?\\
217 - Oh, we're not in a rush to go anywhere.\\
218 - I mean, beach house, no rent...\\
219 - Don't be ridiculous-- you need your own place.\\
220 - Well, that's easier said than done, Mom.\\
221 - How about for your wedding if I give you a down payment\\
222 - towards your own...Oh, I love you, Mom!\\
223 - I won't go thatfar, but thank you.\\
224 -     Men.   \\
225 - [doorbell rings]\\
226 - Walden.\\
227 - Oh, don't worry, Alan's not with me.\\
228 - Wow, it's amazing\\
229 - how infrequently I actually get to say that.\\
230 - What's up?\\
231 - I just wanted to make sure you're okay.\\
232 - That's sweet, but I'm fine.\\
233 - When I get dumped, I usually end up sobbing in a bathtub,\\
234 - listening to Michael Bubl  .\\
235 - I call it my "Bubl   bath."\\
236 - You sure you're all right?Yeah.\\
237 - I was about to marry Larry,\\
238 - a guy who once called venetian blind cleaners\\
239 - because he wanted to help handicapped Italians.\\
240 - Look, if Alan\\
241 - and Gretchen are supposed to be together,\\
242 - I wish them the best.\\
243 - If you need anything, don't hesitate to call me.[laughs]\\
244 - Thanks.Okay.\\
245 - [laughs]\\
246 - [beeps]\\
247 - Siri, remind me to draw a Bubl   bath tonight.\\
248 - Mm, what's that, Larry?\\
249 - You forgive me and you still want to marry me?\\
250 - Oh, Alan...\\
251 - you never stopped loving me and you want to marry me, too?\\
252 - I am the luckiest woman in the world.\\
253 - [laughing]\\
254 - [sobbing]\\
255 - [laughing]\\
256 - [sobbing]\\
257 -     Men.   \\
258 -     Men.   \\
259 - Everybody, freeze.\\
260 - What the hell?\\
261 - Berta, I know where you hide your pot.\\
262 - WALD-E!\\
263 - No...!\\
264 - Now, that'show you deal with a DEA drone.\\
265 - No!\\
266 - It's my robot!\\
267 - I was playing a joke.\\
268 - Oh.\\
269 - It was funny.\\
270 - Oh... oh...\\
271 - Don't worry, little ro-buddy.\\
272 - We'll get you on life support.\\
273 - Or tech support. Oh, he would've loved that joke.\\
274 - I lost the head of one of my toys once.\\
275 - Of course, I had to go to the emergency room to get it out.\\
276 - Um, listen, I know this may not be an opportune moment,\\
277 - but, um, I was wondering, would you do me the honor of...\\
278 - being my best man?\\
279 - Of course. I would have been hurt if you didn't ask.\\
280 - Oh, thanks, thanks. Great, man.\\
281 - Uh, oh, and better get your speech ready\\
282 - for the rehearsal dinner.\\
283 - I'm taking everybody to Souplantation.\\
284 - Fingers crossed we all end up at the same table.\\
285 - Come on, come on, come on. We...\\
286 - we got to go someplace fancier.\\
287 - Well, I would love to, but I can't affo...\\
288 - I'll pay for it.\\
289 - Great. We've got reservations\\
290 - at 7:30 at La Dolce.\\
291 -     Men.   \\
292 - [clinking]\\
293 - I would like to make a toast to the bride and groom.\\
294 - Um, I don't look at this\\
295 - as losing a friend\\
296 - so much as gaining a guest room.\\
297 - [chuckles]\\
298 - I don't see this as losing a friend either.\\
299 - Anyway, uh, to the happy couple.\\
300 - Uh, Alan,\\
301 - you're like a brother to me.\\
302 - And, Gretchen, you...\\
303 - have a smile that lights up those around you\\
304 - and a heart big enough to let them all in.\\
305 - So...\\
306 - cheers.\\
307 - That was so sweet.\\
308 - Is he gay?\\
309 - If he was, you think I'd be with you right now?\\
310 -     Men.   \\
311 - [knocking]\\
312 - Um, occupied.\\
313 - [rattling]\\
314 - Ocupado.\\
315 - [rattling]\\
316 - S-Sprechen Siepoopin.\\
317 - Alan.\\
318 - Lyndsey?!\\
319 - I need to talk to you.\\
320 - You scared the crap out of me. Literally.\\
321 - This'll just take a sec.\\
322 - Wh-What are you doing?\\
323 - My whole family's here in the restaurant.\\
324 - I'm here to say yes.\\
325 - To what?\\
326 - Your proposal.\\
327 - I want to be your wife.\\
328 - I am yours forever and ever and ever.\\
329 - I am crazy for you.\\
330 - Oh, I don't doubt that.\\
331 - You know you still want me.\\
332 - Fate has brought us here together.\\
333 - Uh, actually, my lactose intolerance\\
334 - has brought us here together.\\
335 - Whatever. It was meant to be.\\
336 - Um, Lyndsey, Lyndsey,\\
337 - a-as romantic as this moment is,\\
338 - um, uh, I-I'm in love with Gretchen.\\
339 - [crying]: What happened to me?\\
340 - I was the prize.\\
341 - Men were fighting over me.\\
342 - Am I not hot anymore?\\
343 - [snorting sniffle]\\
344 - Oh, I'm gonna need that.\\
345 - Here.\\
346 - They're sanitized for your protection.\\
347 - [blowing nose loudly]\\
348 - Look, I-I still care about you and...\\
349 - Oh, stop it.\\
350 - I don't want your pity.\\
351 - I'm gonna get out of here while I still have my dignity.\\
352 - Oh, great.\\
353 - Now everyone at the table's gonna know I was pooping.\\
354 -     Men.   \\
355 - Hey, Alan,\\
356 - I have a little surprise for your big day.\\
357 - Oh! Cash or check?\\
358 - I brought Jake to the wedding.\\
359 - My son. Yes. Yes.\\
360 - Yes, that's-that's way better than cash.\\
361 - Um, uh, where is he?\\
362 - Hi, Dad.\\
363 - Pull my finger.\\
364 - [digital fart sound]\\
365 - Classic Robot Jake.\\
366 - Alan, can I see you a second?\\
367 - Oh, did you see Jake came to the wedding?\\
368 - Sure, of course. Hello, Jake.\\
369 - Hey, Larry.\\
370 - Hey.\\
371 - You're looking... pretty pensive.\\
372 - Oh, thanks, it's a rental.\\
373 - You look pretty pensive, too.\\
374 - Actually...\\
375 - Thank you.\\
376 - Uh, hey, I just wanted to say that it's, um....\\
377 - it's pretty big of you to forgive Alan the way you did.\\
378 - I mean,\\
379 - after hearing that he was still sleeping with Lyndsey\\
380 - when you two were dating...\\
381 - ...is apparently something you're hearing\\
382 - for the first time right now.\\
383 - Are you freakin' kidding me? They were cheating?!\\
384 - I'll kill him!\\
385 - Larry, Larry,\\
386 - I'm sorry.For what?\\
387 - This.\\
388 - Okay, let's get this show on the road!\\
389 - Whoa, whoa, whoa. What-What's the rush?\\
390 - Oh, uh, I accidentally told Larry\\
391 - that you and Lyndsey were cheating on him,\\
392 - so he wanted to kill you so I pushed him off the deck.\\
393 - Let's go! Showtime! Chop, chop! Come on!\\
394 - ["Bridal Chorus" playing]\\
395 - WALDEN: Oh,\\
396 - wow, so pensive.\\
397 - Where's my brother?\\
398 - Oh.\\
399 - Uh,\\
400 - he was overcome with emotion.\\
401 - So he hit the beach.\\
402 - Uh, but don't worry. I'm filming it.\\
403 - Oh, by the way, if you trip on your dress\\
404 - and accidentally flash us, just go with it.\\
405 - A-All right, honey, you look beautiful,\\
406 - but let's move it along, please.\\
407 - Uh, Jenny, hit it.[clears throat]\\
408 - "Daughters, mothers, sisters, we gather here,\\
409 - safe from the patriarchy and the oppression of its penises..."\\
410 - Oh, I really should've revised this\\
411 - before doing a straight wedding.\\
412 - Um, wh-why don't we, uh, skip to the vows that you guys wrote?\\
413 - All right. Um... [clears throat]\\
414 - I, Gretchen, do swear to honor and cherish you.\\
415 - You asked me to go down the road of life with you,\\
416 - and I am answering.\\
417 - I will go down.\\
418 - That's what she said.\\
419 - And I, Alan, do swear to honor,\\
420 - cherish and stand behind you\\
421 - whether things are easy\\
422 - or things are hard.\\
423 - [crying]: That's what he said.\\
424 - Alan, do you take Gretchen to be your...\\
425 - LYNDSEY: I object!\\
426 - Lyndsey?\\
427 - Lyndsey, Lyndsey, you can't be here.\\
428 - Aren't I a pretty, pretty bride, Alan?\\
429 - Yes.\\
430 - You look insanely beautiful.\\
431 - Uh, now let's turn you around\\
432 - and get you in a cab. How 'bout...\\
433 - No!\\
434 - This was supposed to be my day!\\
435 - My wedding!\\
436 - My groom!\\
437 - My f... Wait.\\
438 - Those are my flowers.\\
439 - [gasps] That's my food!\\
440 - Those are my linens.\\
441 - [gasps] That's my...\\
442 - I think she was gonna say "cake"!\\
443 - I always liked her.\\
444 - So, uh... so where were we?\\
445 - Gretchen?\\
446 - Derek?\\
447 - Who's this guy?\\
448 - He's my ex-husband.\\
449 - [laughing]: Oh, come on!\\
450 - What are you doing here?\\
451 - Some crazy lady called and said you were getting married.\\
452 - Well, actually,\\
453 - what she said was,\\
454 - "Gretchen, pretty, pretty bride"\\
455 - followed by two minutes of intense vomiting.\\
456 - Pretty sure that was her.\\
457 - Boo-ya!\\
458 - Gretchen, I know I made some horrible mistakes.\\
459 - I drank too much, I wrecked your truck,\\
460 - I cheated on you with your best friend.\\
461 - In your truck. While I was drunk.\\
462 - Which is why I wrecked it.\\
463 - Lose your dog and you got a country song. [chuckles]\\
464 - I wouldn't know. I'm more into hip-hop.\\
465 - I miss you, baby. I want you back.\\
466 - ALAN: Hey, Derek,\\
467 - if you want her back,\\
468 - you're gonna have to go through me.\\
469 - Fine by me.\\
470 - And him.\\
471 - Look, seeing you in that white dress right before\\
472 - I beat up two goobers reminds me of our wedding.\\
473 - But this time the cake's not in the shape of Dale Jr.,\\
474 - which is a huge oversight.\\
475 - Derek...\\
476 - You're not actually considering this, are you?\\
477 - I don't know. I'm so confused.\\
478 - I mean, Derek and I have so much history together.\\
479 - This is really hard.\\
480 - That's what she said.\\
481 - [gasps]\\
482 - That's what they say.\\
483 - I'm sorry, Alan. I-I at least have to talk to him.\\
484 - Gretchen, wait!\\
485 - It's times like this a son needs his mother.\\
486 - I'm gonna slip out the back.\\
487 - Serves you right, you bastard.\\
488 - I mean, I love you.\\
489 - Let's work this out.\\
490 - Best wedding ever!\\

498 - [chuckles] Thanks.\\
499 - Gretchen called.\\
500 - She said it's not over.\\
501 - She's just sorting things out.\\
502 - Oh, buddy.\\
503 - "Sorting things out" is just people's way\\
504 - of not giving you bad news.\\
505 - So I take it your...\\
506 - mom's not gonna give you the money for your own place?\\
507 - I'm just sorting things out.\\
508 - You know what?\\
509 - I didn't really want you to leave anyway.\\
510 - Aw. Thanks.\\
511 - Can you believe it?\\
512 - We're still together, three years later.\\
513 - I know.\\
514 - I thought for sure it was over when Charlie died.\\
515 - Thank God I showed up.\\
516 - You're telling me.Hmm.\\

518 - I-I really miss hanging out with you.\\

55 - [door bell rings]\\
56 - I can'   t feel my left arm.\\
57 - Um, uh, you'   re gonna be okay.\\
58 - It'   s probably just gas. Try to fart!\\
59 - Trick...\\
60 - Or treat.\\
61 - Oh, ladies. I'   m sorry, you just got here during a bit of a...\\
62 - Ooh, I can see your nipples, officer.\\

73 - Well, I take a generic Lipitor and a women'   s multi-vitamin.\\
74 - I mean, just so you know, I take the women'   s\\
75 - '   cause it has more iron.\\
76 - Same price, more iron.\\
77 - Yes, please.\\
78 - Is he gonna be okay?\\
79 - We'   re doing all we can, sir.\\
80 - I can'   t believe this is happening, you know?\\
81 - He'   s so young!\\
82 - He leads such a healthy lifestyle...\\
83 - Well, except for all the pot.\\
84 - You know, the-the weed.\\
85 - The... the ganja.\\
86 - The ol'    Mexican spinach.\\
87 - Alan, if I live, I'   m going to kill you.\\
88 - Stop it. You are gonna live.\\

90 - Is he gonna live?\\
91 - We'   re en route with a 35-year-old male.\\
92 - BP is 160/94, pulse is 108.\\
93 - And he'   s dressed as zombie Elvis, over!\\
94 - I-I don'   t know if you guys need to know that.\\
95 - They don'   t.\\
96 - By the way, uh, I'   m dressed as...\\
97 - Ferris Bueller?\\
98 - [laughs]\\
99 - Hey, hey, at least I took a chance with my costume.\\
100 - I mean, Elvis and zombies.\\
101 - It'   s real original.\\
102 - Next year, it'   s vampire Obama.\\
103 - [Transylvanian accent]: "Yes, we can!"\\
104 - Excuse me, do you have anything for the pain?\\
105 - In my ass?\\
106 - I know, I know.\\
107 - I'   m just... I'   m freaking out because I'   m worried.\\
108 - I mean, you are my best friend.\\
109 - And if something were to happen to you,\\
110 - I don'   t know what I would do.\\
111 - I mean, I-I'   ve already lost a brother.\\
112 - I can'   t lose you, too!\\
113 - A-And you'   re more of a brother than he was.\\
114 - And now Jake'   s in the Army, and I'   m all alone.\\
115 - And I don'   t do well when I'   m alone...\\
116 - Here, breathe.\\
117 - Thank you.\\
118 - Am I crazy, or is, uh, something happening here?\\
119 -     Men.   \\
120 - Oh, good, uh, you made it.\\
121 - Uh... Oh, I-I'   m sorry I pulled you out of your Halloween party,\\
122 - I just figured you'   d want to...\\
123 - I wasn'   t at a Halloween party.\\
124 - I-I just assumed, since you'   re dressed...\\
125 - So what happened?\\
126 - I don'   t know.\\
127 - We were about to go out,\\
128 - and he got chest pains and suddenly collapsed.\\
129 - Oh, wow.\\
130 - He'   s so young.\\
131 - So fit.\\
132 - So not you.\\
133 - Hope he'   s okay.\\
134 - I never thought I'   d have a boss better than your brother,\\
135 - but Walden is good people.\\
136 - He'   s the best.\\
137 - The guy has the biggest heart of anyone I have ever met.\\
138 - Yep, a heart of gold.\\
139 - Clogged with arterial plaque.\\
140 - You'   ve been a good friend to Walden.\\
141 - He'   s lucky to have you.\\
142 - He'   s lucky to have you, too, Sister Berta.\\
143 - And, listen, um...\\
144 - if, God forbid, the worst happens,\\
145 - I-I just want you to know that, uh...\\
146 - you'   ll always have a job at the house.\\
147 - I mean, we'   d have to talk reduced salaries, but, uh...\\
148 - What makes you think he'   d leave you the house?\\
149 - I'   m his best friend.\\
150 - There'   s nobody closer to him than me.\\
151 - I clean his underwear.\\
152 - I wearhis underwear.\\
153 - [laughs]\\
154 - Alan Harper?\\
155 - Oh, oh, that'   s me.\\
156 - I'   m Dr. Prajneep.\\
157 - Your friend had a mild heart attack.\\
158 - We put in a stent to clear the blockage.\\
159 - Is that bad?\\
160 - In general,\\
161 - a heart attack is bad.\\
162 - But, uh, he should make a full recovery.\\
163 - Oh, thank God.\\
164 - Oh, that is a huge relief.\\
165 - Um, is there anything we should do at home?\\
166 - I just want to make sure he has all the care he needs.\\
167 - Uh, any special diet, exercises, medications?\\
168 - If it'   d help,\\
169 - I'   d chew up his food and feed him like a baby bird.\\
170 - How could that possibly help?\\
171 - I'   ll tell you what doesn'   t help-- that tone.\\
172 - Can we see him?\\
173 - Soon as he'   s in recovery.\\
174 - Any other questions?\\
175 - Uh, no, we'   re just happy that he'   s gonna be okay.\\
176 - Thank you.\\
177 - My pleasure.\\
178 - By the way, Ferris Bueller is my favorite movie.\\
179 - Wait, B-Berta. W-Where are you going?\\
180 - We'   re not supposed to go back there yet.\\
181 - I'   m a nun at a hospital.\\
182 - I can do whatever the hell I want.\\
183 - I'   m dead.\\
184 - And I'   m in hell.\\
185 - Relax.\\
186 - You'   re in the hospital.\\
187 - You had a mild heart attack, but you'   re gonna be fine.\\
188 - I don'   t feel very good.\\
189 - That'   s because they put a stent in your heart.\\
190 - But also I feel really good.\\
191 - That'   s because they put morphine in your veins.\\
192 - We should start keeping morphine in the house.\\
193 - I know a guy.\\
194 - Berta, you'   re so funny.\\
195 - I would'   ve missed you so much if I would'   ve died.\\
196 - Oh, oh, but you don'   t have to worry about that.\\
197 - Y-You'   re not going anywhere.\\
198 - I love you guys.\\
199 - We love you, too.\\
200 - You know, when I think about it,\\
201 - you guys are my only real family.\\
202 - Oh, Walden, that'   s so...\\
203 - Horrible.\\
204 - Okay.\\
205 - Saved your life, but whatever.\\
206 - My life is pathetic.\\
207 - I mean, thank you guys so much for being here.\\
208 - But you'   re not good enough!\\
209 - Okay, now it sounds like my family.\\
210 - Um...\\
211 - Maybe you should rest.\\
212 - You know, just go to your happy place.\\
213 - I know a shortcut.\\
214 - Say when.\\
215 - Whe...\\
216 - [squeals]\\
217 - Dressed as a nun, giving some guy morphine--\\
218 - boy, does this take me back to high school.\\
219 - Hey, how you feeling?\\
220 - I'   m all right.\\
221 - Well, uh, I know\\
222 - something that'   ll make you feel better.\\
223 - I made some of my famous three bean salad.\\
224 - The secret--\\
225 - [whispers]: I use four beans.\\
226 - Garbanzo.\\
227 - Shh.\\
228 - You ever look out at the ocean\\
229 - and think about how small and insignificant you are?\\
230 - I don'   t need the ocean; I can just call my mother.\\
231 - I almost died, Alan.\\
232 - But the important thing is you didn'   t.\\
233 - So, now you just have to listen to your doctors,\\
234 - don'   t stress about anything and relax.\\
235 - [shrill laughing] [screams]\\
236 - Sorry, sorry, sorry.\\
237 - Sorry.\\
238 - That was supposed to scare the life out of trick-or-treaters,\\
239 - not you.\\
240 - This sucks!\\
241 - How am I the one with a stent in my heart?\\
242 - I'   m healthy, I-I'   m fit.\\
243 - You sit in front of the TV every night,\\
244 - shoveling a pint of ice cream down your throat.\\
245 - Hey, I eat my feelings,\\
246 - and you are sending me right back to the freezer.\\
247 - You know, it just goes to show,\\
248 - your life can end in the blink of an eye.\\
249 - One day you'   re here, the next day you'   re gone.\\
250 - That'   s why I live by the philosophy\\
251 - "One day I'   m here, the next day I'   m still here."\\
252 - You know, if-if I would have died, who would have missed me?\\
253 - What are you talking about? I would, Berta would.\\
254 - A-And you just got an e-mail from Netflix the other day\\
255 - that literally said, "We miss you."\\
256 - You know, other than you guys and my mom, I got nobody.\\
257 - At least you got Jake.\\
258 - Well, that'   s true.\\
259 - I'   ll always have my little guy.\\
260 - Although, in his last e-mail,\\
261 - he, uh, asked me when the Fourth of July was this year.\\
262 - But, yes, I'   m very lucky.\\
263 - Do you know how much I would give to have a kid\\
264 - who didn'   t understand the concept of a calendar?\\
265 - All I have is money.\\
266 - Yeah.\\
267 - '   Cause I wouldn'   t give up Jake for a billion dollars.\\
268 - I got to make some changes.\\
269 - Changes are good.\\
270 - Uh, you know, I remember when I switched\\
271 - from American Idolto The Voice.\\
272 - My life turned around\\
273 - like Blake Shelton'   s chair.\\
274 - You know what?\\
275 - I want to have a kid of my own.\\
276 - What?\\
277 - Yeah, I want something to give my life meaning.\\
278 - I want somebody I can love unconditionally.\\
279 - Someone I can teach, someone I can nurture,\\
280 - someone I can leave all this to.\\
281 - Well...\\
282 - I mean, I don'   t know what to say, except...\\
283 - Papa?\\
284 -     Men.   \\
285 - Have you thought this through?\\
286 - Having a kid is a lot of work.\\
287 - Having you is a lot of work.\\
288 - You know, having a child would give my life meaning.\\
289 - Otherwise, all this has been for nothing,\\
290 - and that'   s difficult to accept.\\
291 - You know what'   s difficult?\\
292 - Removing a marble your kid shoved up his nose.\\
293 - I did something like that.\\
294 - I jammed a penny up there.\\
295 - I was trying to get a gumball to fall out of my butt.\\
296 - But a kid is permanent.\\
297 - It'   s not like you'   re dating.\\
298 - You can'   t just stop calling or change your number\\
299 - or fake your own death because they annoy you.\\
300 - You do that to women?\\
301 - No, they do it to me.\\
302 - Look, I-I'   m sorry if it feels like I'   m being negative,\\
303 - because the truth is, you know, kids are amazing.\\
304 - But you just had this big health scare,\\
305 - and you'   re probably not in the best frame of mind\\
306 - to make life decisions.\\
307 - I mean, this morning, you cried at a beer commercial.\\
308 - Yeah, but the horse and the puppy were best friends!\\
309 - Look,\\
310 - having a heart attack didn'   t make me realize\\
311 - I want to have a kid, it made me realize\\
312 - I don'   t want to live another day without one.\\
313 - It was like a wake-up call.\\
314 - All right.\\
315 - If you really want to do this, I will be here to support you.\\
316 - From my room.\\
317 - Which, FYI, is way too drafty to use as a nursery.\\
318 - Don'   t worry. You'   re not going anywhere.\\
319 - Sweet! Let'   s get that kid!\\
320 - So, uh, who'   s the lucky lady\\
321 - who'   s gonna receive your seed?\\
322 - See, you just put your creepy little finger\\
323 - right on the problem.\\
324 - I haven'   t exactly been successful in love.\\
325 - It'   s like I'   m running JavaScript and women are running HTML5.\\
326 - Talking like that is part of the problem, isn'   t it?\\
327 - Yeah.\\
328 - And it'   s weird, because your package is perfect.\\
329 - And... and by "package," I don'   t mean your package,\\
330 - I mean your... package.\\
331 - Although, that is also a showstopper.\\
332 - Okay, I can'   t believe that this is not the first time\\
333 - I'   ve said this, but stop looking at my penis.\\
334 - Well, now that you'   ve mentioned it,\\
335 - I can'   t stop looking.\\
336 - It'   s like the elephant'   s trunk in the room.\\
337 - Don'   t worry, you'   ll-you'   ll find somebody.\\
338 - And, you know, it goes without saying\\
339 - that if I could, I would happily bear you a child.\\
340 - Okay, I wish all of this had gone without saying.\\
341 - You doing okay?\\
342 - Yeah, I'   m good.\\
343 - He wants to have a kid. Now all he needs is a woman.\\
344 - Would you consider a pregnant stripper?\\
345 - Uh, no.\\
346 - Well, that rules out both my granddaughters.\\
347 - Morning. Did you take your pills?\\
348 - Yep.\\
349 - Are you lying to me or are you lying to yourself?\\
350 - [rattling]\\
351 - They'   re too big. It'   s hard to swallow.\\
352 - If you say "that'   s what she said,"\\
353 - I will kill you.\\
354 - You know what she said?\\
355 - "Take your pills. I care about you."\\
356 - Fine.\\
357 - Do you know how long it takes to get a baby?\\
358 - Well, I know it takes, uh, five months of mood swings\\
359 - and four months of not wanting to be touched.\\
360 - And who knows what my ex-wife was going through.\\
361 - I was just researching surrogacy,\\
362 - and they say that once you choose a great candidate,\\
363 - it can take up to three years\\
364 - before you have a baby in your arm.\\
365 - I can'   t wait that long.\\
366 - I mean, who knows if I'   ll even still want a kid by then?\\
367 - Tell me about it.\\
368 - Six months into Jake'   s life, I was like, "Check, please!"\\
369 - I was kidding.\\
370 - As was I.\\
371 - Okay.\\
372 - I'   ve narrowed down my options to either adoption\\
373 - or seeing if Brad and Angelina\\
374 - have an extra one they could throw me.\\
375 - Uh, you know, if you really want to adopt...\\
376 - For the last time, Alan, I am not adopting you!\\
377 - But, Papa...\\
378 - Ah! All right.\\
379 - I already reached out to a lawyer\\
380 - who specializes in adoption.\\
381 - Well, you'   re a perfect candidate to adopt.\\
382 - I mean, you'   re highly educated, you'   re likeable,\\
383 - uh, you have a stable home environment...\\
384 - Financially secure, no criminal record, handsome.\\
385 - I-I don'   t... I don'   t think handsome really comes into play.\\
386 - Doesn'   t it, Alan?\\
387 - No, I don'   t think so.\\
388 - Doesn'   t it?\\
389 - You'   re being ridiculous.\\
390 - Am I?\\
391 - I will steal you a baby.\\
392 -     Men.   \\
393 - So, as you can see, finances are not an issue.\\
394 - I have a lot of extra free time,\\
395 - and I know I can provide a loving, nurturing home.\\
396 - You okay?\\
397 - Are you?\\
398 - Seriously, do I need to call someone?\\
399 - Never mind.\\
400 - What'   s important is that\\
401 - I will coach the hell out of the Braves.\\
402 - Excuse me?\\
403 - It'   ll be the name of my son'   s tee-ball team.\\
404 - Pretty Pink Ponies, if it'   s a girl.\\
405 - You know what, if my son wants to play\\
406 - for the Pretty Pink Ponies, then so be it.\\
407 - Tolerant.\\
408 - Well, Mr. Schmidt,\\
409 - you are obviously more than qualified.\\
410 - Thank you.\\
411 - That said, I'   d start looking\\
412 - at Golden Retriever puppies,\\
413 - '   cause there'   s no way you'   re getting a baby.\\
414 - Well, I don'   t understand.\\
415 - You just said that I'   m more than qualified.\\
416 - And you are.\\
417 - But you'   re a single guy,\\
418 - and the system is really geared towards married couples.\\
419 - That'   s racist.\\
420 - Uh, no, it'   s not.\\
421 - Then it'   s sexist.\\
422 - Nope.\\
423 - Well, it'   s some kind of "sist."\\
424 - Look, I'   m not saying it'   s impossible, okay?\\
425 - Just that it'   s difficult.\\
426 - You'   re in line behind families that already have children,\\
427 - married couples, single women...\\
428 - Anyone else?\\
429 - What, sweat shops? Circuses?\\
430 - The Vienna Boys'    Choir?\\
431 - Look, I wish I had better news, okay?\\
432 - If you were married, this would be a slam dunk.\\
433 - Okay, you don'   t get it.\\
434 - Marriage is not an option for me.\\
435 - Okay, I understand you'   re frustrated...\\
436 - No, what'   s frustrating is that every woman I meet\\
437 - runs screaming from me!\\
438 - I was married before and she left me\\
439 - and I tried to commit suicide.\\
440 - Don'   t write that down.\\
441 - Why are you writing that down?!\\
442 - No, no...\\
443 - Then I proposed to two other women,\\
444 - and they both shot me down.\\
445 - I am incapable of maintaining\\
446 - a long-term relationship with anybody.\\
447 - Now, give me a frickin'    baby!\\
448 - Okay.\\
449 - I think we'   re done here.\\
450 - No, we are not done here!\\
451 - I almost died wearing a bedazzled jumpsuit\\
452 - and my life needs meaning.\\
453 - Stop writing things down!\\
454 - Mmm.\\
455 - Hey, how'   d it go?What kind of world...\\
456 - Uh-oh.\\
457 - ...are we living in\\
458 - where any two high school kids with a broken condom\\
459 - can screw behind an Applebee'   s Dumpster,\\
460 - have a baby, give it up for adoption,\\
461 - but not have it go to an adult who is upstanding,\\
462 - responsible, and, might I add, handsome...\\
463 - ...simply because every woman I meet\\
464 - eventually grows to loathe me?\\
465 - And because of that, the Pretty Pink Ponies\\
466 - will not have a tee-ball coach!\\
467 - So it didn'   t go well?\\
468 - [mocking]: No, it did not go well.\\
469 - All right, well, uh, first things first.\\
470 - Uh, how about we get you a little Zin\\
471 - to calm your nerves?\\
472 - It'   s just not fair.\\
473 - I know, I know.\\
474 - Uh, thank you.\\
475 - Just because I'   m single, I'   m not a fit parent?\\
476 - Did they say that to you?\\
477 - That'   s how I felt.\\
478 - Apparently, the whole system\\
479 - is geared towards married couples.\\
480 - And-and single guys are not welcome.\\
481 - Like a Studio City swingers party.\\
482 - Exactly.\\
483 - Wait, what?\\
484 - Nothing. So, uh, did you tell her everything?\\
485 - I mean, how you'   re successful, you'   re warm, you'   re caring...\\
486 - I told her everything.Did you give her the smile?\\
487 - Of course I gave her the smile.\\
488 - She thought I was having a stroke.\\
489 - So nothing worked?\\
490 - No. Even if I hadn'   t been escorted out by security,\\
491 - I still don'   t think they were giving me a kid.\\
492 - Wow, I'   m, uh... I'   m really sorry.\\
493 - You know, it'   s ridiculous.\\
494 - Why-why are married people automatically better parents?\\
495 - My mom was married six times; didn'   t help her.\\
496 - See, and I would'   ve been a great dad.\\
497 - I would'   ve played catch with him,\\
498 - I would'   ve read to him,\\
499 - I would'   ve waited till he went to sleep\\
500 - before I smoked pot.\\
501 - Already got my mom beat.\\
502 - But-but you shouldn'   t give up.\\
503 - I mean, you might still find somebody.\\
504 - No, I don'   t want to marry somebody\\
505 - just to marry somebody.\\
506 - It'   s got to be the right person.\\
507 - Ooh, or Mila Kunis.\\
508 - I get it.\\
509 - That'   s hard to find.\\
510 - [timer dings]Oh, that'   s my banana bread.\\
511 - I love your banana bread.\\
512 - I know.\\
513 - I made it hoping we could celebrate,\\
514 - but it works on a sad tummy, too.\\
515 - Oh, what would I do without you?\\
516 - I hope you never have to find out. [chuckles]\\
517 - What?\\
518 - You are... always there for me.\\
519 - Yeah, and-and you'   re always there for me.\\
520 - We'   re best friends.\\
521 - What if we were more than friends?\\
522 - Like...\\
523 - super friends?\\
524 - Alan Harper,\\
525 - will you marry me?\\
526 -     Men.   \\
527 - Are you seriously asking me to marry you?\\
528 - I can'   t believe this is happening.\\
529 - And I always thought Alan would be the one on his knees.\\

1 - Previously on Two and a Half Men...I'   m dead.\\
2 - You'   re in the hospital.You had a mild heart attack.\\
3 - I almost died, Alan.\\
4 - But the important thing is you didn'   t.\\
5 - Other than you guys and my mom, I got nobody.\\
6 - At least you got Jake.\\
7 - I want to have a kid of my own.\\
8 - You are obviously more than qualified. Thank you.\\
9 - I'   d start looking at golden retriever puppies,\\
10 - '   cause there'   s no way you'   re getting a baby.\\
11 - You'   re a single guy, and the system\\
12 - is really geared towards married couples.\\
13 - Alan Harper, will you marry me?\\
14 -     Men.   \\
15 - Wait. You seriously want to marry me?\\
16 - Yes.\\
17 - Alan Jerome Harper,\\
18 - would you be my wi...?\\
19 - Hus...?\\
20 - Life buddy?\\
21 - Okay, I'   m a little confused.\\
22 - And not like the time I-I got that massage from that lady-boy.\\
23 - Look, I want to adopt a kid,\\
24 - and the quickest way for me to do that is to get married.\\
25 - And if I'   m gonna settle for someone,\\
26 - it might as well be you.\\
27 - That'   s exactly what my first wife said.\\
28 - Listen, I-I know this sounds crazy,\\
29 - but you would be doing me the biggest favor of my life.\\
30 - Walden, there are literally millions of women\\
31 - who would marry you at the drop of a hat.\\
32 - Yeah, but I wouldn'   t be half as happy\\
33 - with any of them as I would be with you.\\
34 - Go on.\\
35 - When-when I think of the ten things I want in a wife,\\
36 - you have nine of them.\\
37 - You'   re my best friend, you'   re trustworthy,\\
38 - you'   re loving, you'   re smart, you'   ll never leave me.\\
39 - Married or not, till death do us part.\\
40 - You'   re funny, you'   re understanding.\\
41 - You don'   t care if I leave the toilet seat up.\\
42 - I actually prefer it.\\
43 - Although, the other night, I forgot it was up,\\
44 - and I had a surprise splash-down.\\
45 - I was like a turtle on its back.\\
46 - Right there. That'   s another one.\\
47 - As long as you'   re around,\\
48 - I will never be the most awkward guy in the room.\\
49 - So, what'   s the one thing\\
50 - you want in a wife that I don'   t have?\\
51 - Oh. Right, right.\\
52 - I-I do not have one of those.\\
53 - I barely have one of these.\\
54 - I mean, how would this work exactly?\\
55 - I mean, we'   re gonna pretend to be a couple?\\
56 - We wouldn'   t pretend.\\
57 - We'   re actually going to be a same-sex married couple.\\
58 - And like most married couples, we will not have sex.\\
59 - Not even on my birthday?\\
60 - Sorry, sorry... flashback to the first wife.\\
61 - So, so, I can have crazy, anonymous sex\\
62 - with any woman I want?\\
63 - No. You will still be you.\\
64 - Oh.\\
65 - Mr. Alan Harper-Schmidt.\\
66 - Dr. Alan Schmidt.\\
67 - What are you doing?\\
68 - Oh, just trying to see what sounds best.\\
69 - Yes, Mr. and Mr. Harper-Schmidt,\\
70 - welcome back to the Four Seasons.\\
71 - Your ocean front suite is ready.\\
72 - Okay, cut the Schmidt.\\
73 - Oh, yeah, I'   d have to put up with that Schmidt.\\
74 - But you know what? I'   m gonna own it.\\
75 - I don'   t give a Schmidt.\\
76 - What are you saying?\\
77 - I'   m saying, yes, I'   ll marry you, you big dumb Schmidt.\\
78 - [laughing]\\
79 - Ah.\\
80 - Oh, please tell me that'   s ChapStick in your pocket.\\
81 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
82 -     Ah.     Men.     Men.\\
83 -     Men.   \\
84 - [doorbell rings]\\
85 - Hi, Mom. Thanks for coming over.\\
86 - What is so important\\
87 - that I had to leave halfway through my bikini wax?\\
88 - I look like a black and white cookie.\\
89 - Wow. In one fell swoop, there goes cookies and vaginas.\\
90 - What'   s going on?\\
91 - Is this another intervention?\\
92 - For the millionth time, I do not havea drinking problem.\\
93 - No, Evelyn. It'   s-it'   s a celebration.\\
94 - Well, in that case,\\
95 - I'   ll have a double martini and hold the vermouth.\\
96 - Hello. I'   m Robin. I'   m Walden'   s mother.\\
97 - Oh, how nice to finally meet you.\\
98 - You have a wonderful son and amazing breasts.\\
99 - Who did them?\\
100 - God?\\
101 - Well, he'   s still the best.\\
102 - Although Dr. Schenkman runs a close second.\\
103 - They are lovely.\\
104 - Okay, can everyone stop talking about my mom'   s boobs? God.\\
105 - Oh, my God, that'   s why I had so many friends in high school.\\
106 - So, what'   s the big announcement?\\
107 - Uh... Well... [chuckles]\\
108 - Alan and I...\\
109 - We'   re getting married!\\
110 - Dude! What the hell! We agreed I was gonna say it.\\
111 - Sorry, sorry. I'   m just so excited.\\
112 - Uh, no offense, but can'   t you do better than Alan?\\
113 - Back up. You are marrying him?\\
114 - Yup.\\
115 - Ow! What was that for?\\
116 - For marrying Zippy.\\
117 - Hey! Why are you hitting me?!\\
118 - For beingZippy.\\
119 - This sounds great, except for one thing.\\
120 - You guys aren'   t gay.\\
121 - No, we'   re not gay.\\
122 - We are getting married because...\\
123 - It'   ll make it easier for him to adopt a child!\\
124 - Aah, come on!\\
125 - Uh, thank you, Berta.\\
126 - ROBIN: Hold on.\\
127 - You want a child?\\
128 - Yes. I'   ve been doing a lot of thinking\\
129 - about my life, and I believe\\
130 - that having a kid would add more meaning to it.\\
131 - Parenthood can be very rewarding.\\
132 - Some of the time.\\
133 - So, this marriage is just a sham?\\
134 - I didn'   t march in all of those gay rights parades\\
135 - so you guys could make a mockery of our hard-won civil liberties.\\
136 - You marched in those parades\\
137 - so you could get drunk and pick up chicks.\\
138 - Hard-wonchicks.\\
139 - All right, look, we'   re not making a mockery of anything,\\
140 - and I get the challenges that gay couples face,\\
141 - but I-I also know that there are a lot of kids out there\\
142 - that are just looking for a good home,\\
143 - and I think we can provide that.\\
144 - And I get health insurance.\\
145 - You guys are lucky you'   re in California.\\
146 - In some states, they still don'   t let gay couples get married\\
147 - or adopt kids.\\
148 - You know, when I was in Utah,\\
149 - I vomited on a police officer, and I was arrested.\\
150 - Simply for being gay.\\
151 - Wow, this is a lot to take in.\\
152 - My son is going to get married and have a child with...\\
153 - Oh, God, where... where did I go wrong?\\
154 -     Men.   \\
155 - Oh, there he is, my same-sex shorty.\\
156 - My friend with no benefits.\\
157 - My boo.\\
158 - You know, I do have 99 problems, and you'   re all of them.\\
159 - What'   s all this?\\
160 - Uh, oh, I'   m, uh...\\
161 - I'   m makinga dream board for our wedding.\\
162 - Uh, there'   s also a Pinterest page,\\
163 - or you can go to: Alan and Walden'   s big day dot com.\\
164 - Yeah, I got the link you sent me.\\
165 - Uh, I really loved the photoshopped picture\\
166 - of both us peeking around the same tree.\\
167 - However, you know,\\
168 - we'   re not doing, like, a big, lavish wedding.\\
169 - Oh, okay, I get it.\\
170 - You know, small destination wedding.\\
171 - Just the two of us, the beach, wearing leis around our necks,\\
172 - matching linen shirts, sand tickling our toes.\\
173 - Seagulls flying overhead.\\
174 - Ca-kaw! Ca-kaw!\\
175 - And where do you see this happening?\\
176 - Well, obviously, there'   s Hawaii and Cabo.\\
177 - Um,\\
178 - I'   d be happy with either one of those.\\
179 - Um, but I hear that Greece is fabulous this time of year.\\
180 - And just FYI, Mykonos is very friendly to same-sex couples.\\
181 - Opa!\\
182 - Nopa!\\
183 - We'   re getting married in the courthouse.\\
184 - Please tell me "the courthouse" is a chic bar in Ibiza.\\
185 - No, it'   s a rundown courthouse\\
186 - around the corner from the Jiffy Lube.\\
187 - We'   ll pay 50 bucks,\\
188 - we'   ll do some paperwork,\\
189 - and if you'   re good, we'   ll go outside\\
190 - to the food truck, and I'   ll buy you a gyro.\\
191 - Opa!\\
192 - Oh.\\
193 - Okay. I see.\\
194 - What'   s wrong?\\
195 - Nothing.\\
196 - [sighs] Talk to me.\\
197 - No, it'   s fine.\\
198 - You know, I just wanted to make sure\\
199 - this whole thing was special for us,\\
200 - for you, but, you know, it'   s no big deal.\\
201 - I'   m sure we can still make it special.\\
202 - Maybe, uh... maybe Jenny can take some pictures\\
203 - on her iPhone.\\
204 - Alan, come on.\\
205 - Don'   t touch me.\\
206 - Look, this isn'   t about us.\\
207 - It'   s about bringing a kid into our lives.\\
208 - It'   s a simple business transaction,\\
209 - like paying an electric bill, or buying dinner, or...\\
210 - writing a rent check.\\
211 - Stop me when I land on something you'   ve actually done.\\
212 - I just got excited\\
213 - because I'   ve never had the wedding I always dreamed of.\\
214 - Right, the wedding that every little boy dreams of.\\
215 - You know, we still need to get each other rings.\\
216 - We can just get something online.\\
217 - Or we could go into Beverly Hills and have brunch,\\
218 - and go ring shopping together.\\
219 - Really?\\
220 - Sure.\\
221 - Because I do have ideas.\\
222 -     Men.   \\
223 - ALAN: Hey, Berta,\\
224 - do we have any carrots?\\
225 - Oh, wait. I'   ve got 14 karats of white gold\\
226 - right here.\\
227 - You'   ll make a beautiful bride, Zippy.\\
228 - Hey.Hey, there'   s my future baby daddy!\\
229 - If I got to listen to this, I got to be a lot higher.\\
230 - Hey, uh, I got some paperwork for you to sign.\\
231 - Oh, uh, and I'   ve got some paperwork for you to sign.\\
232 - Guess it'   s true. Married couples dostart to think alike.\\
233 - Maybe soon, we'   ll start to look alike, he said hopefully.\\
234 - It'   s the application form for our marriage license.\\
235 - Oh, look at you. Yeah.\\
236 - I guess somebody'   s gonna get that money\\
237 - for that mani-pedi he wants after all.\\
238 - Ah, you spoil me.\\
239 - No, I'   m just trying to be a good business partner.\\
240 - The Johnson to your Johnson.\\
241 - Wait, that-that didn'   t come out right.\\
242 - So, uh... so what do you need me to sign?\\
243 - Uh, just this.\\
244 - Oh. What'   s that? [laughs]\\
245 - Oh, it'   s a simple dissolution of services agreement.\\
246 - Oh! Oh, you-you mean, like a... like a prenup?\\
247 - Yup. So, it'   s not a big deal.\\
248 - Just go ahead and sign it, he said hopefully.\\
249 - Why do we need a prenup?\\
250 - And here we go.\\
251 - Uh...\\
252 - when couples get married,\\
253 - finances become complicated,\\
254 - and this just simplifies it.\\
255 - Oh, does it?\\
256 - '   Cause it seems like it'   s pretty simple right now.\\
257 - You don'   t trust me.\\
258 - Okay, that'   s not true at all.\\
259 - Isn'   t it?\\
260 - I mean, is this what you really think of me?\\
261 - That I'   m some kind of gold digger?\\
262 - Okay, yes, I have lived here four years rent-free.\\
263 - Look, why do you have to make this difficult?\\
264 - You know, why do you make everythingso difficult?\\
265 - It'   s like yesterday at brunch, when you sent back the champagne\\
266 - because the bubbles didn'   t taste like "a mouthful of stars."\\
267 - If it doesn'   t explode in your mouth, what'   s the point?\\
268 - You said that to the waiter, too, and it was troubling then!\\
269 - Look, I'   m just trying to protect my assets.\\
270 - Oh-oh, yeah? Well, then maybe I should protect my assets.You know,\\
271 - don'   t worry, I'   m pretty sure that your VHS copy\\
272 - of Dirty Dancing and your complete collection\\
273 - of Ghostbusterstrading cards are safe.\\
274 - I am a collector of '   80s movie memorabilia.\\
275 - And hobby mocking is not an attractive color on you.\\
276 - Hobby mocker.\\
277 - I also have one other asset that you cannot have,\\
278 - my dignity.\\
279 - Your dignity?!Mm-hmm.\\
280 - Your dignity...?Yes.\\
281 - Really? '   Cause I'   m pretty sure that the security guard\\
282 - at the shopping mall had to remove the bench\\
283 - from outside of Victoria'   s Secret because of you!\\
284 - Mall flogger!\\
285 - I got to tell you, I'   m having a lot of second thoughts right now.\\
286 - Really? Because this is exactly where I want to be in my life,Mm-hmm.\\
287 - begging a 47-year-old man to marry me.\\
288 - Now sign the prenup!\\
289 - I agreed to marry you, but that doesn'   t mean you get\\
290 - to shove whatever you want down my throat\\
291 - and expect me to swallow it!\\
292 - Do-do you... do you even hear\\
293 - the words that you are saying?!\\
294 - How about these words? The wedding'   s off!\\
295 - [crying]\\
296 - I can'   t even get Alan Harper to marry me.\\
297 -     Men.   \\
298 -     Men.   Boy, this better be important.\\
299 - I just saw you two days ago.\\
300 - Walden and I broke up. The-the wedding is off.\\
301 - Oh, Alan.\\
302 - You had a rich husband on the hook\\
303 - and you couldn'   t reel him in.\\
304 - What happened?\\
305 - Well, he asked me to sign a prenup and I refused.\\
306 - Well, of course you refused.\\
307 - The woman I paid to raise you did not raise a fool.\\
308 - Mom, I don'   t want his money.\\
309 - Never say that again.\\
310 - Is that a new ring?\\
311 - Feels like Cartier.\\
312 - Yes, it is. And you know who gave it to me?\\
313 - My rich husband.\\
314 - When Marty and I married, the only thing I was willing to sign\\
315 - was his "do not resuscitate" order.\\
316 - Walden says this wedding is just a-a business transaction.\\
317 - H-How many business transactions end\\
318 - with the release of grand monarch butterflies?\\
319 - Darling, it is just business.\\
320 - He'   s using you to get what he wants,\\
321 - and you should be using him to get what you want:\\
322 - financial security.\\
323 - I'   m not doing it for financial security.\\
324 - Walden genuinely wants a child,\\
325 - the same way that I wanted Jake and-and you wanted...\\
326 - Charlie.\\
327 - I just thought that after four years together\\
328 - that he would trust me when it comes to money.\\
329 - Oh, darling, after 47 years, I don'   t trust you.\\
330 - Maybe, uh, a-a prenup is justified.\\
331 - Maybe I am just a sponge.\\
332 - A-a-a parasite.\\
333 - And-and he tolerates me because he'   s my best friend.\\
334 - And I'   ve let him down,\\
335 - and all I want to do is make him happy.\\
336 - "Best friend."\\
337 - "Happy."\\
338 - I just have no idea where you got these warped views\\
339 - on marriage.\\
340 - He wouldn'   t sign a prenup?\\
341 - No, he got all upset and he threw a hissy fit.\\
342 - "You don'   t trust me. The wedding'   s off.\\
343 - I'   m going to Ibiza by myself."\\
344 - Let'   s face it, the man is simply not your equal.\\
345 - If the two of you were on a plane that crashed\\
346 - in the mountains, Alan would be the first person eaten.\\
347 - On the other hand,\\
348 - you'   re handsome, successful, smart.\\
349 - You would be eaten last.\\
350 - You'   re just saying I'   d be eaten last '   cause you'   re my mom.\\
351 - Well, listen, I know you'   re serious about this child thing,\\
352 - so I mentioned your situation to a very cute intern at work.\\
353 - You didn'   t.Oh, Jessica'   s very amenable to striking a business deal.\\
354 - [sighs] Plus,\\
355 - she'   s already visited Dr. Schenkman,\\
356 - if you know what I mean.\\
357 - Mom, that'   s exactly what I don'   t want.\\
358 - I don'   t even know this Jess...\\
359 - Holy Schenkman.\\
360 - Look, I-I w...\\
361 - No, she'   d be eaten first.\\
362 - Look, no, I want someone that I can trust.\\
363 - That'   s why I picked Alan in the first place.\\
364 - How can you possibly trust him?\\
365 - He siphons gas out of your car.\\
366 - Technically, I never caught him.\\
367 - I just assumed that he did it\\
368 - '   cause the garden hose smelled like gas\\
369 - and one time he burped near a candle\\
370 - and it lit the couch on fire.\\
371 - I don'   t know why you ever let Alan live with you in the first place.\\
372 - Uh, for starters, he saved my life.\\
373 - And... he'   s been there for me,\\
374 - every time that I needed him and even times when I didn'   t.\\
375 - The bottom line is...\\
376 - he'   s my best friend.\\
377 - Jessica could be your best friend.\\
378 - I'   m not going out with Jessica.\\
379 - Fine. I get it.\\
380 - I do have another intern that you might like better.\\
381 - His name is Derek. He does Pilates...\\
382 - Mom, I'   m not gay!\\
383 - I-I just want to marry a man.\\
384 - Why is that so difficult to understand?\\
385 -     Men.   \\
386 - Hey.\\
387 - Hey.\\
388 - Listen... About earlier...\\
389 - Uh, that-that'   s, that'   s my fault.\\
390 - I-I totally get why I need to sign a prenup.\\
391 - I mean, there'   s guys standing at freeway onramps\\
392 - that make more money than I do.\\
393 - You know what, you don'   t need to sign it.\\
394 - Despite my mother'   s objections\\
395 - and despite everything I'   ve learned from...\\
396 - two seasons of Basketball Wives,\\
397 - I trust you completely.\\
398 - That'   s nice, but, uh,\\
399 - I already signed it and sent it to your attorney.\\
400 - Really?\\
401 - Thank you. I-I owe you.\\
402 - You owe me nothing.\\
403 - I mean, other than two dollars for the envelope\\
404 - and $1.75 for postage.\\
405 - Nothing for gas?\\
406 - No, I just filled up.\\
407 - Will you still be my husband?\\
408 - You know I can'   t quit you.\\
409 - Listen, I-I know this isn'   t the wedding\\
410 - that you'   ve always dreamed of,\\
411 - but I-I got a little surprise for you for the ceremony.\\
412 - Tell me Vera Wang started making tuxes.\\
413 - Even better.\\
414 -     When a man loves another man\\
415 -     Can'   t keep his mind on nothing else...    \\
416 - Oh... my... God.\\
417 - It'   s like you live inside my dreams.\\
418 - Happy wife, happy life.\\
419 - Uh, fellas, can we get this going?\\
420 - There'   s a lot of gay couples here who'   d like to get married\\
421 - before the Supreme Court changes its mind.\\
422 - Plus, this place is crawling with cops,\\
423 - and I'   ve got six months to a year hidden in my purse.\\
424 -     When a man loves another man    \\
425 - Kill it, Bolton.\\
426 - Hello, Michael.\\
427 - You know, I have a vibrator named after you.\\
428 - Well, that'   s very flattering.\\
429 - Would you like me to sign it?\\
430 - I have a special pen.\\
431 - What a coincidence.\\
432 - I have a bit of a nasty habit\\
433 - of putting the tips of pens into my mouth.\\
434 - We'   re here to join Walden Schmidt\\
435 - and Alan Harper in legal marriage.\\
436 - Have you two written your own vows?\\
437 - No, the, uh, standard... the standard\\
438 - "for richer, for poorer" actually fits us quite well.\\
439 - Actually,\\
440 - I'   ve written a little something down.\\
441 - What? You didn'   t.\\
442 - I wanted to surprise you.\\
443 - [chuckles] Vows and Bolton?\\
444 -     When a man...\\
445 - Not the cue, Bolton.\\
446 - Today,\\
447 - I'   m marrying my best friend.\\
448 - Do not cry.\\
449 - Keep it together, Alan. [clears throat]\\
450 - In the last four years, I'   ve been through a lot.\\
451 - Uh, there'   s been good times and bad times.\\
452 - But through it all, you were there.\\
453 - And I can'   t imagine a future without you.\\
454 - I guess what I'   m trying to say is...\\
455 - I love you.\\
456 - [voice breaking]: I love you, too.\\
457 - This is the gayest wedding I'   ve ever been to.\\
458 - I think it'   s beaut... Wh-Whose hand is on my ass?\\
459 - Sorry. Sorry.\\
460 - Walden,\\
461 - do you take Alan to be your lawfully wedded husband?\\
462 - I do.\\
463 - And, Alan, do you take Walden to be your...\\
464 - Try and stop me.\\
465 - I now pronounce you married.\\
466 - You may kiss.\\
467 - Oh. Oh, yeah.\\
468 - Um, kiss. Right. [chuckles]\\

473 -     Men.   Morning.\\
474 - Hey. There'   s the old balls and chain.\\
475 - How was your wedding night?\\
476 - Much like my first one.\\
477 - I spent it masturbating alone.\\
478 - You'   re the only guy I know\\
479 - that would register for lotion and tissues.\\
480 - That was some party last night, huh?\\
481 - Yeah, it must have been. I woke up out here.\\
482 - And I'   m pretty sure I'   m wearing Jenny'   s underwear.\\
483 - Yeah.\\
484 - The whole evening'   s a little fuzzy for me, too.\\
485 - The last thing I remember is you doing body shots\\
486 - off of Michael Bolton.\\
487 - All of us did body shots off of Michael Bolton.\\
488 - Even our moms got along.\\
489 - I wasn'   t sure they'   d click at first, but...\\
490 - in the end, they came together.\\

1 - Previously on Two and a Half Men...\\
2 - I almost died, Alan.\\
3 - But the important thing is you didn'   t.\\
4 - Other than you guys and my mom, I got nobody.\\
5 - At least you got Jake. I want to have a kid of my own.\\
6 - There'   s no way you'   re getting a baby-- you'   re a single guy,\\
7 - and the system is really geared towards married couples.\\
8 - Alan Harper, will you marry me?\\
9 - I now pronounce you married.\\
10 - You may kiss.\\
11 -     Men.   \\
12 - Um, yes, this is Walden Schmidt.\\

16 - What'   s the cash advance limit on my black card?\\
17 - Holy new Rolex.\\
18 - Oh, oh, m-my mother'   s maiden name?\\
19 - Uh, I didn'   t really know her before she was married, so...\\
20 - Morning.\\
21 - Um, uh, I'   ll call back later.\\
22 - Charities.\\
23 - It'   s not like the kids won'   t still be starving in an hour.\\
24 - Um...\\
25 - Hey, I was meaning to ask you something.\\
26 - Um, what'   s your mother'   s maiden name?\\
27 - This might be easier if I just give you my online password.Oh.\\
28 - It'   s "Don'   t order credit cards in my name."\\
29 - Right, uh, all one word, no spaces?\\
30 - Hey, there'   s the newlyweds.\\
31 - I made you some honeymoon pancakes.\\
32 - Aw...\\
33 - They'   re in the shapes of hearts and arrows.\\
34 - Oh, actually, they'   re asses and...\\
35 - Uh, sure-- hearts and arrows.\\
36 - [laughs]\\
37 - Alan, my arrow'   s twice as big as yours.\\
38 - Mine'   s life-size.\\
39 - I'   m still gonna be hungry.\\
40 - I just realized, Walden,\\
41 - that I worked for you when you were single.\\
42 - And now you'   re married.\\
43 - Maybe someday I'   ll be working for you when you'   re a widower.\\
44 - Bacon, Zippy?\\
45 - So, how'   s the adoption process going?\\
46 - Is somebody other than Alan calling you "Daddy"?\\
47 - It'   s going great.\\
48 - We have a meeting with the social services department\\
49 - this week.\\
50 - Nice.\\
51 - So, if you do get a kid, which room is he gonna live in?\\
52 - Oh, guys, I'   m kind of a drunken slut,\\
53 - I don'   t think I should share a room with a baby.\\
54 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
55 -     Ah.     Men.     Men.\\
56 -     Men.   \\
57 - Hey, what ya doing?\\
58 - Oh, paperwork for our meeting with the social worker.\\
59 - Um, household net worth.\\
60 - Well, let'   s see, uh, you'   re worth a billion dollars,\\
61 - so together we are worth...\\
62 - A little bit less than a billion dollars.\\
63 - Hey, so Evelyn said it'   s cool if I crash at her place.\\
64 - What, wait-- it was that easy?\\
65 - My mom never lets me stay there.\\
66 - Yeah, she'   s gonna let me live in the guest house.\\
67 - There'   s a guest house?!\\
68 - If-if you need, uh, help moving, let us know.\\
69 - Thanks, but Evelyn said I could borrow the Range Rover.\\
70 - There'   s a Range Rover?!\\
71 - Oh, hey, uh, what should I put down for, uh...\\
72 - "Why do you want to adopt a child?"\\
73 - Hmm.\\
74 - '   Cause we'   re dudes,\\
75 - and we don'   t have baby holes?\\
76 - [laughing]\\
77 - You know you have to sell yourself\\
78 - as a real couple, right?\\
79 - We are a real couple.\\
80 - That'   s why we got married in the first place.\\
81 - Yeah, it also gave us the chance to register at Crate & Barrel\\
82 - for this fabulous stemware.\\
83 - [chimes]Ding.\\
84 - See, you'   re making jokes instead\\
85 - of expressing real emotion.\\
86 - You'   re gonna have to prove that you'   re a real couple, you know?\\
87 - That you'   re in love, that you'   re soul mates,\\
88 - that you can'   t survive without the other.\\
89 - I actually can'   t survive without him.\\
90 - I am just saying,\\
91 - I don'   t want to see you\\
92 - put all this work in and not get\\
93 - the payoff you deserve.\\
94 - It'   s like when you get "the tap."\\
95 - Get the what?The tap.\\
96 - You know, when you'   re in bed with a girl,\\
97 - and you'   ve been down there for a while,\\
98 - and suddenly she gives you the old "Thanks for trying" tap\\
99 - on the top of the head.\\
100 - Ah...\\
101 - Oh, yeah, the tap, yeah.\\
102 - I hate the tap. Mm.\\
103 - You know, I am sure that we can be believable\\
104 - as a loving couple.\\
105 - You want to see believable? This... [stammers]\\
106 - Watch.\\
107 - Alan,\\
108 - I love you.\\
109 - And I love you, Walden.\\
110 - [laughing]\\
111 - I'   m sorry.\\
112 - You have this one nose hair that keeps going in and out.Oh.\\
113 - And I laughed because no one could possibly love me.\\
114 -     Men.   \\
115 - Guess what I just finished.\\
116 - Once again, you don'   t have to tell me\\
117 - every time you masturbate.\\
118 - I will not apologize for sharing my day with you.\\
119 - But that is not this.\\
120 - It is my essay describing\\
121 - what I love about my spouse\\
122 - for our meeting with the social worker.\\
123 - Ah, good, I'   m so nervous about this meeting.\\
124 - I'   m somehow constipated and wracked with explosive diarrhea.\\
125 - You'   re not the only one who can share his day.\\
126 - Well, after she reads this,\\
127 - there'   s no way she won'   t believe we'   re a couple.\\
128 - Okay, uh, "Walden is the most caring person I know.\\
129 - He always puts my needs before his own."\\
130 - Uh, "Whether it'   s surprising me\\
131 - "with an espresso and a chocolate croissant in bed,\\
132 - "glamping in a yurt at Big Sur,\\
133 - "or sneaking up behind me in the shower with a loofah\\
134 - to exfoliate those hard-to-reach places..."\\
135 - "...he'   s my everything--\\
136 - my husband, my lover, my friend."\\
137 - "My Wally Bear."\\
138 - My God.\\
139 - I know.\\
140 - Now read me yours.\\
141 - Okay, um...\\
142 - "Alan is my best friend."\\
143 - Loving it!\\
144 - "He'   s 47 years old.\\
145 - "He used to be a chiropractor.\\
146 - "He has never been convicted of a felony.\\
147 - And his favorite meal is swordfish."\\
148 - Are you kidding me?\\
149 - That'   swhat you love about me?\\
150 - That I'   ve never been convictedof a felony?\\
151 - I told you it'   s a work in progress.\\
152 - What do you want me to say?\\
153 - He masturbates with impressive frequency?\\
154 - At least that would show you'   re paying attention.\\
155 - [doorbell rings]And, by the way--\\
156 - my favorite meal is red snapper.\\
157 - Hi, Alan.\\
158 - Walden.\\
159 - Lyndsey, what'   s, uh, what'   s going on?\\
160 - I-I thought you were in rehab.\\
161 - I was, I-I got out a couple days ago.\\
162 - Oh, well, that'   s great. C-Come on it.\\
163 - How'   d it go?It was the hardest thing I'   ve ever done in my life.\\
164 - But-but on the plus side,\\
165 - it was right up the street here in Malibu,\\
166 - so ocean views, spa, chef,\\
167 - it was like a five-star hotel.\\
168 - Except they take your shoelaces.\\
169 - Well, I'   m sure you two have a lot to talk about.\\
170 - So, I'   m just gonna go in the kitchen\\
171 - and pretend I'   m not listening.\\
172 - Um, so, Lyndsey, I-I'   m so proud of you.\\
173 - Uh, how are you doing?\\
174 - I'   m good.\\
175 - Um, I-I just got my 60-day chip. Oh.\\
176 - And part of my recovery is to make amends\\
177 - to the people I'   ve hurt.\\
178 - So, I apologize for everything\\
179 - I did to you while I was drinking.\\
180 - Oh, well, I appreciate that, um,\\
181 - but some of the things you did to me,\\
182 - you don'   t have to apologize for.\\
183 - I mean, we had sex in a Chipotle.\\
184 - I ate my burrito, you ate my burrito.\\
185 - I ate your taco.\\
186 - And I later threw up in your car.\\
187 - Yes, uh, but chunks weren'   t the only thing you blew that day.\\
188 - Um, there is one other thing.\\
189 - If-if I haven'   t burned too many bridges,\\
190 - I was wondering if maybe you and I could give it another try.\\
191 - Oh, wow.\\
192 - Wow, that-that is flattering.\\
193 - Um, it'   s just...\\
194 - [sighs] You'   re seeing somebody else.\\
195 - Uh, kind of, um...\\
196 - Uh, uh, I'   m...\\
197 - You'   re married?!\\
198 - That doesn'   t make any sense.\\
199 - Who is she?\\
200 - Uh...\\
201 - Uh, she is-is actually, uh, a "he."\\
202 - Um...\\
203 - It'   s... it'   s Walden.\\
204 - Oh, my God.\\
205 - Walden'   s gay?!\\
206 -     Men.   \\
207 - So, I guess what I'   m interested in is\\
208 - how you two got together.\\
209 - Uh, well, w-we met at the dog park.\\
210 - His Labradoodle sniffed my shih tzu.\\
211 - I remember when I proposed.\\
212 - I-I got down on one knee,\\
213 - and I looked up into his beautiful...\\
214 - ...blue eyes,\\
215 - and I asked him to share his life with me.\\
216 - I guess what I'   m getting at is the fact\\
217 - that you'   ve both been married to women before.\\
218 - So, when did you realize you were gay?\\
219 - Oh, well, on some level, I'   ve always known. Um...\\
220 - I mean, throughout, uh, both of my marriages,\\
221 - I was in complete denial.\\
222 - Um, but after I met Walden,\\
223 - I finally felt safe to-to be myself.\\
224 - Uh, I remember our first date.\\
225 - Uh, we went to the Bowl to see the Greasesing-along.\\
226 - Ah, "Tell me more, tell me more."\\
227 - Well, uh, Walden was dressed as Danny Zuko,\\
228 - uh, and I was Sandy--\\
229 - uh, hot Sandy, you know, in the leather.\\
230 - No, no, no, I was doing the song, you know--\\
231 -     Tell me more, tell me more...    \\
232 - Oh, my God!\\
233 - Did I miss a show tune cue?!\\
234 - [laughs]\\
235 - Somebody take away my gay card.\\
236 - And how about you, Walden?\\
237 - When did you know you were gay?\\
238 - I guess my first clue was when I saw Basic Instinct.\\
239 - All my friends were looking up Sharon Stone'   s skirt,\\
240 - and I was just looking at her shoes.\\
241 - And I guess I got married because of social pressures,\\
242 - but, eventually, I had to be true to who I am.\\
243 - And I'   ve never looked back since.\\
244 - Unless I'   m behind him.\\
245 - [both laughing nervously]\\
246 - [laughing nervously]: That'   s a good one.\\
247 - Ah...\\
248 - You two are an interesting couple.\\
249 - Yeah, I see hundreds of potential parents,\\
250 - but you two are different somehow.\\
251 - I'   m not sure what it is.\\
252 - Well, uh, maybe it'   s the fact\\
253 - that I-I look like I'   m wearing makeup, but I'   m not.\\
254 - Y-You know, we may not be like other couples, but...\\
255 - I know we can be good parents.\\
256 - I get that, but it is my job\\
257 - to be a hundred percent sure before I place a child.\\
258 - No, n-no, look, look...\\
259 - I-I know we can provide unconditional love to a child,\\
260 - a-and w-we can create a safe, secure environment, and...\\
261 - What do people that get kids say?\\
262 - How about this--\\
263 - how about I come out to your house?\\
264 - We normally do a site visit anyway.\\
265 - This way I could get to know you guys a little better.\\
266 - Yeah, great, yeah, why don'   t you come on over,\\
267 - and you'   ll see that we'   re j-just a normal loving couple.\\
268 - Right, sweetie?\\
269 - That-that'   s right, Wally Bear.\\
270 - I love this guy.\\
271 -     Men.   \\
272 -     Men.   \\
273 - Hey.\\
274 - Oh, flowers. Nice touch.\\
275 - Gives the house a homey feel.\\
276 - They'   re for you.\\
277 - Really?\\
278 - I'   m, uh, actually a lily man.\\
279 - Uh, but they'   re very nice.\\
280 - Alan, listen.\\
281 - Jenny was right.\\
282 - We are not believable as a loving couple,\\
283 - and I think that'   s why Miss McMartin wasn'   t sure about us.\\
284 - Now, this has to be real.\\
285 - And that includes--\\
286 - being comfortable with physical affection.\\
287 - Like this.\\
288 - Come on.\\
289 - Loosen up.\\
290 - I-I'   m loose, it just feels a little forced, that'   s all.\\
291 - Okay, well, let it be natural.\\
292 - Just snuggle into these broad shoulders.\\
293 - I do feel safe.\\
294 - Damn right, you do.\\
295 - You'   re with your Wally Bear.\\
296 - Now, look into my eyes.\\
297 - Like this?\\
298 - Yeah, exactly.\\
299 - And don'   t look away.\\
300 - We love each other.\\
301 - You'   re at home.\\
302 - Oh, I just noticed a little green fleck in your right eye.\\
303 - It'   s like a-a downy patch of moss\\
304 - on the trunk of a majestic oak.\\
305 - [whispering]: Thank you.\\
306 - Sometimes I worry that I'   m not good-looking enough for you.\\
307 - Come on.\\
308 - You'   re perfect just the way you are.\\
309 - My Alley Cat.\\
310 - A nickname.\\
311 - Sometimes...\\
312 - I worry that you don'   t know how much you mean to me.\\
313 - I want to be your everything.\\
314 - All right, yeah!\\
315 - That was convincing.\\
316 - We do that in front of Miss McMartin,\\
317 - we'   ll get ten babies.\\
318 - Yeah, yeah.\\
319 - That was good enough to fool just about anyone.\\
320 - [chuckles nervously]\\
321 - [sighs]\\
322 -     Men.   \\
323 - So, this is our kitchen.\\
324 - We love to cook together.\\
325 - Uh, correction, I love to cook,\\
326 - he loves to eat.\\
327 - See? This is what I wanted to see.\\
328 - The two of you just being yourselves.\\
329 - Happy, relaxed.\\
330 - [doorbell rings]Oh, I'   ll get that.\\
331 - If you really want to see us relaxed\\
332 - you should come by for brunch someday.\\
333 - The Mary'   s are bloody and the Lorraine'   s are quiche.\\
334 - Oh, I can see why you fell in love with him.\\
335 - Really?\\
336 - What did you see exactly?\\
337 - Alan!\\
338 - Lyndsey?\\
339 - Um, have you been drinking?\\
340 - Uh, ding-ding-ding, we have a wiener...\\
341 - Whoa, whoa, okay, okay, shh!\\
342 - W-What are you doing here?\\
343 - Well, you said you and Walden\\
344 - are just getting married to get a kid.\\
345 - So, there'   s no reason you can'   t have sex with me on the side.\\
346 - You know, the "DL."\\
347 - That means "Do Lyndsey."\\
348 - Okay, okay, okay, this is not a good time.\\
349 - Uh, the-the social worker'   s here.\\
350 - Oh, that'   s great!\\
351 - I can help you guys.\\
352 - I can tell her that you'   ll be good parents.\\
353 - And I know because I'   m a g... Oh.\\
354 - ...mother.\\
355 - Okay, um...\\
356 - maybe-maybe we should go to my room a-and talk.\\
357 - I won'   t be able to talk much, '   cause my mouth will be full.\\
358 - Wink, wink.\\
359 - [giggles]Hopefully with breath mints.\\
360 - You wait in here and I will call a cab to take you home.\\
361 - My home is in your pants.\\
362 - What happened? Why did you start drinking again?\\
363 - Well, '   cause you married Walden.\\
364 - The only person in your life who'   s prettier than me.\\
365 - But you know we'   re just doing that to get a kid.\\
366 - Yeah, but if I wasn'   t so screwed up last year,\\
367 - then we would still be together.\\
368 - Then we could get married and have a baby. [gasps]\\
369 - We could sell that baby to Walden.\\
370 - '   Cause let'   s face it,\\
371 - we don'   t want to raise another kid,\\
372 - '   cause both our kids suck.\\
373 - Okay, uh, refreshing, drunk honesty aside,\\
374 - um, d-don'   t blame yourself.\\
375 - We all made mistakes.\\
376 - But we shouldn'   t let those mistakes ruin things for Walden.\\
377 - Shh. You talk too much.\\
378 - Let'   s party.\\
379 - Lyndsey? Lyndsey?\\
380 - [groans]\\
381 - Wow, a half-naked drunk girl is in my bed and I'   m leaving.\\
382 - Maybe I am gay.\\
383 - I like to imagine the family gathered here,\\
384 - eating an all-organic, gluten-free meal\\
385 - of quinoa salad and kale chips\\
386 - while watching the original reality TV:\\
387 - a beautiful ocean sunset.\\
388 - As long as this is a stable environment for a child,\\
389 - I don'   t care if you'   re eating Hot Pockets\\
390 - and watching Honey Boo Boo.\\
391 - Uh, uh, Wally Bear, uh, can I borrow you for a minute?\\
392 - Is it an emergency, Alley Cat?\\
393 - Uh, it'   s more of a-a pickle, uh, that needs immediate attention.\\
394 - Oh, it'   s okay. Go.\\
395 - Yeah, I would never come between a man and his husband'   s pickle.\\
396 - Lyndsey'   s here. She'   s drunk.\\
397 - Why?\\
398 - She wants to have sex with me.\\
399 - Why?\\
400 - Wait... Where is she?\\
401 - She'   s passed out in my room.\\
402 - Okay, okay, we-we need to get Ms. McMartin\\
403 - out of here as fast as we can.\\
404 - Right, right. Oh, um, by the way, when Lyndsey\\
405 - tried to kiss me, I was totally into it.\\
406 - I don'   t know why I was worried.\\
407 - Worried about what?\\
408 - Nothing. Let'   s get her out of here.\\
409 - Mm. Everything okay?\\
410 - Yes, we just had to reset the...\\
411 - The, um... [mumbles]: ...flaven on the stave.\\
412 - But, uh, everything'   s\\
413 - okay now. Uh, c-can I get you anything?\\
414 - Like directions for your drive home, or...\\
415 - You know, I actually do have to get going.\\
416 - I did not realize it was this late.What?\\
417 - No.Oh.\\
418 - I'   m so disappointed.Oh.\\
419 - I'   ll just get your things and walk you out.\\
420 - Oh. There we go.[chuckles]\\
421 - I got to say, you look at that view\\
422 - and you never want to leave.\\
423 - And yet you must.\\
424 - Unless you want to adopt me.\\
425 - [chuckles] You'   re so funny. Here'   s your jacket.\\
426 - WALDEN: Oh, my God.\\
427 - What?Uh...\\
428 - This jacket, it'   s-it'   s fantastic.\\
429 - What is this, wool?I think so, yeah.\\
430 - Really? Because I... I would'   ve thought it was linen.\\
431 - Doesn'   t it feel "linen-sy", Alan?\\
432 - No, it'   s definitely wool.\\
433 - Holy crap.What?\\
434 - Uh... I forgot to flip the cushions\\
435 - on the deck furniture.\\
436 - Imagine the mildew.\\
437 - Alan.\\
438 - Milady.\\
439 - Here we go, almost got it.\\
440 - If you could just stay still...\\
441 - Yeah... Oh.\\
442 - Uh, all right, that'   s it. That wasn'   t so hard, was it?\\
443 - Actually, it was a lot harder than it needed to be, but...\\
444 - That'   s what he said.[both chuckle]\\
445 - Uh, well...Oh, your purse.\\
446 - Well, thank you, guys.\\
447 - Uh, you'   ll be hearing from me soon.\\
448 - Got it. Bye.\\
449 - Oh, my God.\\
450 - Is Lyndsey okay?Oh, sure.\\
451 - She'   s practically indestructible when she'   s drunk.\\
452 - I'   ve seen her fall down a flight of stairs\\
453 - and not spill her mojito.\\
454 - [knocking]\\
455 - I'   m so sorry, I forgot my phone.\\
456 - Oh. Here it is, right here on the table. Hey.Oh, hey. Ho!\\
457 - [laughs] Got it. And get the hell out of here.\\

1 -     Men.   [drill whirring, banging]\\
2 - Hey!\\
3 - Oh, hey, morning, Berta.\\
4 - Little warning, man at work.\\
5 - Doing a little banging and screwing.\\
6 - Little warning for you.\\
7 - Woman at bar until 2:00 a.m. doing the same thing.\\
8 - What are you doing?\\
9 - I am baby-proofing the house.\\
10 - It'   s a requirement of the adoption agency,\\
11 - and it'   s a good thing, too.\\
12 - This here kitchen is a death trap.\\
13 - Whole mess of things up in here that can kill someone.\\
14 - We got knives, we got fire, poison, scalding hot water,\\
15 - Alan'   s leftover fish tacos.\\
16 - You worry too much.\\
17 - Jake ate a steady diet of floor wax and detergent,\\
18 - and he turned out...\\
19 - Yeah, maybe it'   s not a bad idea.\\
20 - I locked all the cabinets and the drawers,\\
21 - put these safety knobs on the stove,\\
22 - and if you want to access any chemicals,\\
23 - you will need a special magnetic key.\\
24 - Oh, by the way, when you'   re doing the laundry,\\
25 - keep your eye out for a special magnetic key.\\
26 - Why would you need to lock the towel drawer?\\
27 - You hide your pot in the medicine cabinet.\\
28 - I'   m guessing.\\
29 - That is no ordinary towel drawer.\\
30 - That'   s the first step on the stairway to disaster.\\
31 - Oh, I'   m too hungover for this crap.\\
32 - Okay, okay.\\
33 - All right, imagine, if you will, child pulls out the drawer,\\
34 - climbs up onto the counter and toddles over to the window\\
35 - that has been left open\\
36 - because Alan finds the smell of steaming broccoli\\
37 - to be "gaggy."\\
38 - Whereupon, the child\\
39 - spots a beautiful kite,\\
40 - most likely in the shape of a butterfly or a Pikachu.\\
41 - The child reaches for the kite,\\
42 - tumbles out the window,\\
43 - bounces off the awning, flying through the air,\\
44 - heading toward certain death, when, miraculously, it is caught\\
45 - by a shirtless Matthew McConaughey.\\
46 - "Don'   t worry, your baby'   s gonna be all right,\\
47 - all right, all right."\\
48 - Yeah, sure.\\
49 - You know what, we got lucky this time,\\
50 - but we can'   t depend on McConaughey every time.\\
51 - Okay, I'   m gonna have to start hiding the pot from you.\\
52 - Better safe than sorry.\\
53 - Every stairway, every toilet, every sharp corner\\
54 - has been locked, latched or padded.\\
55 - No one is getting hurt in this house.\\
56 - [screams]\\
57 - Hot!\\
58 - Hot! Hot!\\
59 - All right, all right, all right.\\
60 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
61 -     Ah.     Men.     Men.\\
62 -     Men.   \\
63 - So, as you can see,\\
64 - I installed a gate at the top of the stairs,\\
65 - at the bottom of the stairs, and as an extra precaution,\\
66 - I put one in the middle of the stairs.\\
67 - Overachiever.\\
68 - I think he'   s just trying to keep me from getting away.\\
69 - [chuckles]\\
70 - Well, you did a great job baby-proofing.\\
71 - I can'   t imagine anyone getting hurt in this house.\\
72 - Really? Try telling me I look fat in these jeans.\\
73 - Okay, flame off, Human Torch.\\
74 - So, uh, so, what do we do next?\\
75 - Oh, well, it'   s pretty simple.\\
76 - I walk out onto the deck,\\
77 - you put a pile of hundreds on the table,\\
78 - I come back, slip them into my purse,\\
79 - and you get a kid.\\
80 - I have $5,000 in the bottom of a toolbox in the garage.\\
81 - I was joking.\\
82 - As was I.\\
83 - Anyway, uh, I wasn'   t gonna say anything\\
84 - until you guys passed the inspection,\\
85 - but it looks like we may have found\\
86 - a potential match for the two of you.\\
87 - [gasps]\\
88 - We'   re...\\
89 - We'   re getting a baby.\\
90 - Are you serious? This is unbelievable.\\
91 - Well, slow down; all that'   s happened so far\\
92 - is a pregnant mother has seen your profile\\
93 - and wants to meet you.\\
94 - Somebody saw my profile and wants to meet me?\\
95 - That'   s so different than the dating sites.\\
96 - I can'   t believe this.\\
97 - Who is she? Where is she from?\\
98 - How old is she? Is she having a boy or a girl?\\
99 - Wait, no, la-la-la-la-la!\\
100 - I don'   t want to know. I want to be surprised.\\
101 - Walden, you'   re getting ahead of yourself.\\
102 - Did you say girl?\\
103 - I thought I heard you say girl.\\
104 - Wait, no, you know what?\\
105 - Doesn'   t matter.\\
106 - Ten fingers and ten toes--\\
107 - that'   s all that matters.\\
108 - Are you not saying anything '   cause it'   s a boy?\\
109 - Oh, my God, we'   re having a boy!\\
110 - Okay, Walden, when you meet the mother,\\
111 - you want to come off as a calm, stable father.\\
112 - Not like a 14-year-old girl at a Justin Bieber concert.\\
113 - Sorry, we'   re just really excited.\\
114 - No, I get it. I'   m excited for you.\\
115 - I'   ll call you when the meeting is set up.\\
116 - Oh, and by the way,\\
117 - I think you look fantastic in those jeans.\\
118 - Girl, we are gonna be BFFs.\\
119 - [chuckles]\\
120 - We'   re gonna have a baby.\\
121 - We'   re gonna have a baby.\\
122 - We'   re gonna have a baby.\\
123 - BOTH [laughing]: We'   re gonna have a baby!\\
124 - We'   re gonna have a baby!\\
125 - Oh, we have to celebrate.\\
126 - Uh, I'   ll go to the garage and get some champagne.\\
127 - Great! We'   re gonna have a baby!\\
128 - We'   re gonna have a...\\
129 - Wait, we don'   t have champagne in the garage.\\
130 - [gasps] My toolbox!\\
131 - Alan!\\
132 -     Men.   \\
133 - Here.\\
134 - I got this for you.\\
135 - Why?\\
136 - I think it would be nice\\
137 - if we wore matching sweaters to meet the birth mom.\\
138 - Twinsies.\\
139 - We'   re supposed to be a married couple,\\
140 - not half of a barbershop quartet.\\
141 - Can'   t we be both?\\
142 -     Miss McMartin, bring me a kid    \\
143 -     Bom-bom-bom-bom\\
144 -     Marrying you was a dumb thing I did    \\
145 -     Bom-bom-bom-bom.\\
146 - You were flat.\\
147 - So, the mom-- you think she'   s hot?\\
148 - She'   s nine months pregnant!\\
149 - I know.\\
150 - Love me some preggos.\\
151 - 38-62-38.\\
152 - Baby got back and front.\\
153 - Okay, listen.\\
154 - If we want this girl to give us her baby,\\
155 - she has to think that we'   re a well-adjusted couple.\\
156 - If she gets a creepy vibe off of you,\\
157 - she'   s gonna turn and run the other way.\\
158 - And I'   m only saying this\\
159 - '   cause I'   m getting a creepy vibe off of you.\\
160 - [doorbell rings]\\
161 - Says the guy who Googled "Helen Mirren nip slip."\\
162 - Helen is timeless.\\
163 - Now, listen.\\
164 - If you mess this up for me,\\
165 - I will make your life a living hell.\\
166 - Now, remember, we love each other.\\
167 - Hello, Mama.\\
168 - Hi.\\
169 - Hi, you must be Kathy.\\
170 - Yes, uh, welcome to our Malibu dream house.\\
171 - He'   s Ken.\\
172 - Oh, I guess that makes me Barbie.\\
173 - I'   m Walden.\\
174 - This is Alan.\\
175 - [stammering] Come in.\\
176 - Here, c-can I take your coat?\\
177 - Oh, thank you.\\
178 - [chuckles]\\
179 - Wow!\\
180 - Look at you!\\
181 - So very pregnant.\\
182 - Coat.\\
183 - I know.\\
184 - I haven'   t seen my feet since July.\\
185 - Am I wearing matching shoes?\\
186 - Um...\\
187 - actually, no.\\
188 - Uh, but you know what, it works. It'   s cute.\\
189 - Um, please sit.\\
190 - Yeah, please. How you feeling?\\
191 - My ankles are swollen,\\
192 - my back hurts, and forget about my breasts.\\
193 - I haven'   t even noticed, you know, '   cause I'   m gay.\\
194 - That'   s... [clears throat]\\
195 - That'   s my rainbow warrior.\\
196 - Always waving his flag.\\
197 - Even when it relates to nothing.\\
198 - Um, so, uh, tell us about Kathy.\\
199 - I think the first thing you should know about me\\
200 - is this is not representative of who I am.\\
201 - See, I just graduated\\
202 - from UCLA.\\
203 - The baby is a result of a spring break trip to Vegas.\\
204 - Ah. I guess what happens in Vegas\\
205 - stays in Kathy.\\
206 - Yep, took me about six weeks to figure out\\
207 - that my morning sickness\\
208 - wasn'   t just a really bad hangover.\\
209 - Well, we all make mistakes.\\
210 - One morning, I woke up married to this one.\\
211 - [laughs]\\
212 - See, bottom line, this wasn'   t part of my five-year plan.\\
213 - You know, law school, clerk for a judge,\\
214 - start my own practice.\\
215 - Wow, that'   s-that'   s impressive.\\
216 - Uh, Alan'   s son, Jake,\\
217 - had a five-year plan for the tenth grade.\\
218 - [chuckles]\\
219 - See, that'   s why I liked your profile.\\
220 - You have parenting experience.\\
221 - Your sense of humor came through.\\
222 - And I kind of love that you'   re gay.\\
223 - Not as much as we do.\\
224 - Right, Wally Bear?\\
225 - That'   s right, Alley Cat.\\
226 - Even though I'   m not gonna be part of the baby'   s life,\\
227 - I like the idea of being the only mom.\\
228 - I can totally understand that.\\
229 - Probably because my mom was an ice-cold, sharp-tongue alcoholic\\
230 - who preferred shopping and spas over spending time with me.\\
231 - And I can totally understand that.\\
232 - So, tell me about you.\\
233 - What made you guys decide to start a family?\\
234 - Uh, well, raising my son\\
235 - was one of the greatest experiences of my life,\\
236 - and I just wanted Walden to feel that same joy.\\
237 - Yeah, I mean, for me it'   s a couple reasons.\\
238 - I-I felt like something was missing in my life,\\
239 - and I wanted to give back,\\
240 - and having a kid will allow me to drive in the carpool lane.\\
241 - [laughs]\\
242 - It'   s nice to laugh again.\\
243 - Except I just peed a little on your sofa.\\
244 - I'   ll get you something.\\
245 - Oh, uh, actually, I got something right here.\\
246 -     Men.   \\
247 - [gasps]\\
248 - The baby just kicked.\\
249 - I felt it.\\
250 - Oh, looks like someone'   s got\\
251 - a little soccer star in there.\\
252 - God, you smell good.\\
253 - Alan, you want to come up for some air?\\
254 - Oh, sorry.\\
255 - Just got excited. [chuckles]\\
256 - About the baby.\\
257 - Sure.\\
258 - So, uh, Kathy,\\
259 - uh, do you know if it'   s a boy or a girl?\\
260 - I don'   t, but your profile said\\
261 - you didn'   t have a gender preference, right?\\
262 - Oh, that'   s right.\\
263 - Just like me in my 20s. [chuckles]\\
264 - You guys crack me up.\\
265 - You'   re gonna make great dads.\\
266 - Oh, world'   s greatest, according the coffee mugs I bought.\\
267 - Well, that'   s good, because I made up my mind.\\
268 - I want you to have my baby.\\
269 - No!Yes.\\
270 - Oh, my God! You did not just say that!\\
271 - You bitch!\\
272 - Thank you, Kathy.\\
273 - Thank you, Vegas.\\
274 - Thank you, broken condom.\\
275 - Well, you can thank two-for-one tequila shots\\
276 - at the Tropicana.[chuckles]\\
277 - Let'   s not forget this little guy.\\
278 - [chuckles]\\
279 - [gasps] Do you feel it moving?\\
280 - I can feel it growing.\\
281 -     Men.   \\
282 -     Men.   \\
283 - Okay, best shower gift:\\
284 - Barry. Baby'   s first bong.\\
285 - Yep.\\
286 - And just like the kid'   s diaper,\\
287 - it'   s full of stinky green stuff.\\
288 - The pizza'   s on its way.\\
289 - In the meantime, uh, who wants a beer?\\
290 - Oh, wow. Yeah.\\
291 - There we go.\\
292 - Walden, you are gonna make a great dad.\\
293 - Hey. And, Alan,\\
294 - you'   ve already raised Jake,\\
295 - so I guess just... do the opposite.\\
296 - I still can'   t believe it'   s even possible\\
297 - for two men to have a baby.\\
298 - What an age we live in.\\
299 - Science, right?\\
300 - Larry, we'   re-we'   re not actually having a baby.\\
301 - We'   re adopting.\\
302 - Ah, shooting blanks, huh?\\
303 - Well, I guess if Alan gets pregnant,\\
304 - you'   ll know he'   s been cheating on you.\\
305 - So you two are really married, huh?\\
306 - Yep. Yeah, crazy, isn'   t it?\\
307 - No, I'   ll tell you what'   s crazy.\\
308 - You have never hit on me once, Walden.\\
309 - I mean, we worked together every day, side by side,\\
310 - and not so much as a lingering glance\\
311 - or a "Gee, you look nice today, Barry.\\
312 - "You lost a little weight, Barry?\\
313 - Those cargo shorts really flatter your calves, Barry."\\
314 - No, man.\\
315 - We got married so I could adopt a baby.\\
316 - That... we'   re a pretend couple.\\
317 - It'   s kind of like your "girlfriend in Canada."\\
318 - [scoffs]\\
319 - Okay, Olivia is real.\\
320 - I mean, just... Okay, look at these nude photos she sent me.\\
321 - That'   s Jennifer Lawrence.\\
322 - She gets that all the time.\\
323 - In a couple days, I'   m gonna be a dad.\\
324 - [laughs]\\
325 - I'   m gonna be completely responsible\\
326 - for the emotional and financial well-being\\
327 - of someone who is completely incapable\\
328 - of taking care of themselves.\\
329 - Thank you for being my test baby.\\
330 - I'   d keep my fingers crossed for a boy.\\
331 - Why?Well, basic math.\\
332 - If you have a boy, you only have to worry about one penis.\\
333 - You have a girl, you have to worry about them all.\\
334 - Either way, you'   re gonna love it.\\
335 - Being a father is the best thing in the world.\\
336 - How old are your kids?\\
337 - Well, my son is 15\\
338 - and my secret daughter is going to be 11 this year.\\
339 - Your... your secret daughter?\\
340 - Yeah, she looks a lot like my secret wife.\\
341 - You know, kids are amazing.\\
342 - You know? You get to pass all this knowledge down\\
343 - to this little person and-and shape their mind.\\
344 - Like, you know, how to talk to girls\\
345 - and how to be there for your friends when they need you.\\
346 - Oh, you can teach them your ability\\
347 - to always be in the bathroom whenever the dinner check comes.\\
348 - That'   s pure instinct.\\
349 - Can'   t be taught.\\
350 - [phone ringing]\\
351 - You know, all my memories revolve around my dad.\\
352 - The time he threw my Tamagotchi down the garbage disposal.\\
353 - Time he made a pass at my prom date.\\
354 - Time he divorced my mom and married my prom date.\\
355 - WALDEN: Guys.\\
356 - Guys, it'   s the hospital.\\
357 - Oh, if it'   s one of my patients, I'   m not here.\\
358 - Oh, don'   t worry. If I'   m your\\
359 - kid'   s doctor, I won'   t do that.\\
360 - It'   s what you say.\\
361 - Kathy'   s in labor!\\
362 - We got to go!\\
363 - I'   ll get an Uber.\\
364 - I'   ll go grab the car seat.\\
365 - I'   ll get the diaper bag.\\
366 - [doorbell rings]\\
367 - Oh, God, that'   s the pizza guy.\\
368 - Um... hey, Alan,\\
369 - could you pay the pizza guy?\\
370 - ALAN: I'   m in the bathroom!\\
371 - How does he do it?\\
372 -     Men.   \\
373 - Hey, you know, I-I appreciate you guys coming,\\
374 - but you really don'   t have to stay.\\
375 - Are you kidding? We want to be here.\\
376 - You know what they say.\\
377 - "To raise a child, it takes the Village People."\\
378 - Hey, guys?\\
379 - I think I may have gotten way too high.\\
380 - Can somebody take me to the hospital?\\
381 - You'   re in a hospital.\\
382 - [gasps]\\
383 - Whoa.\\
384 - How'   d you do that?\\
385 - I wonder why we haven'   t heard anything.\\
386 - They took Kathy to the delivery room, like, an hour ago.\\
387 - Sometimes the baby just doesn'   t want to come out.\\
388 - I mean, put yourself in its position.\\
389 - For nine months, you'   ve been floating\\
390 - in the world'   s nicest waterbed.\\
391 - Then somebody opens a trap door, all the water flows out,\\
392 - a set of salad tongs grabs you by the head and yanks you out,\\
393 - and then some guy you never seen before\\
394 - starts slapping you on the ass.\\
395 - Reminds me of a trip I took to Tijuana once.\\
396 - WALDEN: Aw, look at how cute that one is.\\
397 - Yeah, she'   s got a nice rack, too.\\
398 - What are you looking at?\\
399 - The hot nurse. What are you looking at?\\
400 - That baby.\\
401 - Ugh! You guys are sick.\\
402 - So have you guys decided on a name for the baby yet?\\
403 - Oh, no, not yet. No.\\
404 - It'   s such a big responsibility.\\
405 - I don'   t want to give him a name\\
406 - that other kids can make fun of.\\
407 - Well, bad news. Every name can be made fun of.\\
408 - That'   s not true.\\
409 - Really?\\
410 - How'   s your pond, Walden?\\
411 - It'   s an intellectual insult, but it still stings.\\
412 - I was "Larry the fairy" all through high school.\\
413 - Oh, no way! I was "Barry the fairy."\\
414 - Somebody noticed that you could rearrange\\
415 - the letters of "Alan," and I became\\
416 - "Little Anal Harper."\\
417 - My name'   s "Herb."\\
418 - Kids skipped the clever puns\\
419 - and just shoved my head down a toilet.\\
420 - Well, I'   m sure there are plenty of names\\
421 - that kids can'   t make jokes about.\\
422 - Mr. and Mr. Harper-Schmidt?\\
423 - Yeah, nothing to worry about there.\\
424 - Just the hyphenated last name of the two gay dads.\\
425 - So how'   s Kathy?\\
426 - She'   s doing fine.\\
427 - So is your brand-new baby boy.\\
428 - Oh, my God, we got a boy!\\
429 - I get a do-over for Jake!\\
430 - I only have to worry about one penis!\\
431 - I like to wear women'   s underwear!\\
432 - What?\\
433 - I thought we were confessing things.\\
434 - NURSE: There he is.\\
435 - ALL: Aw...\\
436 - He'   s got your nose and Alan'   s eyes.\\
437 - Larry, I told you before that...\\
438 - Thank you, Larry.\\
439 - ALAN: Look at him. He'   s so amazing.\\
440 - WALDEN: I can'   t think of anything more beautiful\\
441 - than what I'   m looking at right now.\\
442 - Yeah. Mm-hmm. It'   s true, that'   s the truth.\\
443 - But how much more beautiful would it be\\
444 - if those two nurses just started making out right now?\\
445 - Mm-hmm.Oh, yeah.\\
446 -     Men.   \\
447 - ALAN: Hey.\\
448 - How you doing?\\
449 - I'   m good.\\
450 - Tired.\\
451 - Sore.\\
452 - Look at this little guy.\\
453 - Can I hold him?\\
454 - Uh, sure.\\
455 - Oh, he is the cutest thing ever.\\
456 - Mm-hmm.\\
457 - Hey, hey... high-five.\\
458 - You can owe me.\\
459 - [chuckles]\\
460 - Welcome to the world, little buddy.\\
461 - We'   re gonna have so much fun.\\
462 - We'   re gonna go to ball games together\\

464 - and pick up chick... ens together.\\
465 - Smile. Come on.\\
466 - Okay, uh...\\
467 - Oh, oh, oh. Look at that picture.\\
468 - The two most handsome men in the world.\\
469 - And they'   re both mine.\\
470 - [baby crying]Oh, oh...\\
471 - Oh, what'   s the matter?\\
472 - Uh, maybe he wants his mommy.\\
473 - Oh, all right, come here, little buddy.\\
474 - Uh, I think he might be hungry.\\
475 - Oh, of course.\\
476 - Oh, yeah, of course.\\
477 - Okay, here.\\
478 - There.\\
479 - I miss him already.\\
480 - Yeah, it'   s hard to let him go.\\
481 - Actually, it'   s impossible.\\
482 - Oh.\\
483 - I am so sorry.\\
484 - Wait. What, uh... what just happened?\\
485 - Did I... did I miss something?\\
486 - She'   s keeping the baby.\\
487 - Uh...\\
488 - But what-what about law school?\\
489 - The-the five-year plan?\\
490 - After I saw this little guy...\\
491 - the plan changed.\\
492 - I mean, before, I couldn'   t imagine my life with him.\\
493 - Now I can'   t imagine it without him.\\
494 - But... but he'   s gonna be a great dad.\\
495 - Alan... No, no. H-He loves him.\\
496 - Alan, it'   s...\\
497 - Okay, let'   s-let'   s just approach this practically.\\
498 - Um... how much for the kid?\\
499 - Uh, I have, uh,\\
500 - I have $32 on me.\\
501 - I'   m gonna need three dollars for dinner at ampm,\\
502 - but the rest is yours.\\
503 - Believe me, I feel terrible.\\
504 - You feel terrible?\\
505 - We'   re-we'   re gonna be driving home with an empty car seat.\\
506 - And you know what'   s waiting for us when we get there?\\
507 - An empty nursery. An empty crib.\\
508 - An empty... uh, uh....\\
509 - What'   s that Swedish thing\\
510 - that, uh, that you wear like a pouch,\\
511 - to carry your baby around like a kangaroo?\\
512 - Bjorn.\\
513 - An empty Bjorn!\\
514 - An empty blue baby Bjorn!\\
515 - Hard to say, but even harder to face.\\
516 - Alan, just... stop.\\
517 - It'   s okay.\\
518 - I wouldn'   t be able to give him up either,\\
519 - so I don'   t blame you.\\
520 - Really?\\
521 - I get it. You'   re his mom.\\
522 - I'   m so sorry to put you through all this.\\
523 - Don'   t be sorry.\\
524 - He'   s... lucky.\\
525 - You'   re both... very lucky.\\
526 - This man is a saint.\\
527 - A damn saint.\\

540 - Look at him.\\

1 -     Men.   \\
2 - Thanks for coming in, guys.\\
3 - It'   s always a pleasure seeing you.\\
4 - I mean, she'   s so pretty. You'   re so pretty.\\
5 - You know anyone we can set her up with?\\
6 - I appreciate the thought, but I am perfectly happy\\
7 - with my... cats.\\
8 - Anyway...\\
9 - how would you guys feel about adopting an older child?\\
10 - Wow. Like, how old are we talking?\\
11 - Like, I'   ve been taking care of this one since he was 43.\\
12 - [laughs]\\
13 - He'   s been a wonderful provider.\\
14 - And he only spanks me when I ask him to.\\
15 - Wow, that is a lot to take in before 10:00 a.m. on a Monday.\\
16 - That'   s what he said.\\
17 - Okay, please stop.\\
18 - That'   s what he said.\\
19 - Oh! The reason I bring it up is because there is\\
20 - a six-year-old boy who'   s been bouncing around\\
21 - the foster system for a while,\\
22 - and I think he'   d be a great match for you guys.\\
23 - Wow, really?\\
24 - Uh, well, six is a great age.\\
25 - Potty-trained but not ashamed of you yet.\\
26 - WALDEN: Well...\\
27 - well, uh, can we adopt him right away?\\
28 - Well, we'   d start with a weekend visit.\\
29 - See if it'   s a good fit, then, assuming it is,\\
30 - you guys would become his foster parents.\\
31 - After six months, if everyone agrees,\\
32 - you can officially adopt him.\\
33 - Oh, and-and-and if we don'   t agree,\\
34 - can we credit those six months to a kid that we do like?\\
35 - [all laugh]\\
36 - Wow, I-I always thought we were gonna get a baby,\\
37 - but I kind of like the idea of giving an older kid a shot.\\
38 - Well, Louis certainly deserves a shot.\\
39 - Louis?\\
40 - Louie?\\
41 - Aw, sweet Lou.\\
42 - [bellows]: Lou!\\
43 - Uh, is he married to that name or can we change it?\\
44 - Alan.\\
45 - Oh, I'   m sorry, I'   m sorry.\\
46 - I just, you know, I had my heart set on Beckett.\\
47 - Look, I'   m gonna be honest with you guys.\\
48 - Louis has had a rough time.\\
49 - He'   s been in foster homes, group homes.\\
50 - He'   s moved around a lot.\\
51 - We thought we had him placed for adoption\\
52 - a few months ago, but it fell through.\\
53 - So he'   s gonna be a little gun-shy.\\
54 - Well, don'   t worry about that.\\
55 - I mean, I'   m sure we'   ll have a great time together.\\
56 - Just don'   t expect a lot.\\
57 - Same thing I told this one on our wedding night.\\
58 - Wow, I really like this idea.\\
59 - I mean, I'   m gonna... I'   m gonna have a son.\\
60 - How cool is that gonna be?\\
61 - I mean, and-and you get to relive\\
62 - all those great father-son moments.\\
63 -     By the time you hear the siren    \\
64 -     It'   s already too late    \\
65 -     One goes to the morgue and the other to jail    \\
66 -     One gets wasted and the other'   s a waste...    \\
67 - [vomiting]Good thinking.\\
68 - [farts]\\
69 - Dad?Yeah, buddy?\\
70 - Bite me.\\
71 - [farting]\\
72 - [fart echoing]\\

77 -     Men.   \\
78 - What the hell?\\
79 - Walden?WALDEN: Up here!\\
80 - Check it out! Isn'   t this awesome?\\
81 - They have one just like it at the Google headquarters!\\
82 - Oh, you know what you get when you Google\\
83 - "greatest dad in the world"?\\
84 - This guy!\\
85 - [laughs]\\
86 - [stammers] What is going on?\\
87 - What is all this?\\
88 - Oh, uh, well, I went to the toy store\\
89 - and got a few things for Louis.\\
90 - "A few things"? Okay, I don'   t want to be the guy\\
91 - to point out the 800-pound gorilla in the room.\\
92 - But there'   s an 800-pound gorilla in the room.\\
93 - I just want him to like it here.\\
94 - Well, so do I.\\
95 - But if you build Disneyland in your house,\\
96 - you'   ll never get the thrill of taking him to Disneyland.\\
97 - Ah. You'   re right.\\
98 - Damn it. I got to cancel Mickey and Minnie.\\
99 - What? Oh, I was gonna have him\\
100 - wake him up in the morning.\\
101 - [imitating Mickey Mouse]: Hey, Louis.\\
102 - Ready for breakfast?\\
103 - We'   ve got orange juice\\
104 - and waffles shaped just like me!\\
105 - I think it'   s great that you'   re so excited about being a dad.\\
106 - And the best part is... no stretch marks for me.\\
107 - You know, you'   re my best friend,\\
108 - but you'   re an odd little man.\\
109 -     Men.   \\
110 - Oh, hey.\\
111 - What are you doing up?\\
112 - I couldn'   t sleep.\\
113 - Oh, I get it. Excited about tomorrow?\\
114 - More like terrified about tomorrow.\\
115 - Why are you getting paper towels\\
116 - in the middle of the.. Oh, you... Never mind.\\
117 - I don'   t want to know.\\
118 - That'   s a good call.\\
119 - You want to talk about it?\\
120 - There'   s a kid showing up here tomorrow.\\
121 - And he needs a dad, and I don'   t know if I can do it.\\
122 - What? Why not?\\
123 - Well, I'   ve never had a successful relationship\\
124 - with anyone in my life except for you.\\
125 - Four years next Thursday.\\
126 - Yeah, I got your wish list.\\
127 - They'   re just ideas. Make it your own.\\
128 - Look, the fact that you'   ve screwed up with women\\
129 - doesn'   t mean you can'   t be a great father.\\
130 - I don'   t even know what a good dad looks like.\\
131 - I mean, I know what a bad dad looks like.\\
132 - It'   s an empty chair across the table from my mom.\\
133 - Which later gets filled by my "Uncle Kenneth"\\
134 - who sold speedboats.\\
135 - And "Uncle Rob" who sold insurance.\\
136 - Then "Uncle Stan" who sold pot.\\
137 - I liked Uncle Stan.\\
138 - I get it. I didn'   t grow up with a dad, either.\\
139 - When Jake was born, I was scared out of my mind.\\
140 - Why were you scared? You'   re a great dad.\\
141 - Okay, I'   m gonna tell you something\\
142 - that I'   ve, I'   ve never told anybody before.\\
143 - When Jake was a baby...\\
144 - I dropped him.\\
145 - Right smack on his head.\\
146 - Oh, my God.\\
147 - Now I feel awful about all the times I said,\\
148 - "Were you dropped on your head as a baby?"\\
149 - My point is that Jake turned out fine.\\
150 - I mean, sure, he had to repeat seventh grade math\\
151 - a couple of times, but he was born at the right time.\\
152 - You know? Computers.\\
153 - Wait, so what you'   re saying is\\
154 - even if I screw up a little, it'   s not the end of the world?\\
155 - The fact that you'   re worried about being a good dad\\
156 - is what'   s gonna make you a great one.\\
157 - Thanks.Hmm.\\
158 - You'   re a good friend.\\
159 - All right.\\
160 - I'   m gonna go get some sleep.\\
161 - Good night.Good night.\\
162 - Oh, Baby Jake.\\
163 -     Men.   \\
164 - It'   ll be nice having a kid around here again.\\
165 - Running up and down the stairs.\\
166 - Laughing at all the silliest things.\\
167 - And they'   ll believe almost anything you tell them.\\
168 - No kidding.\\
169 - Jake still thinks one of the first men\\
170 - on the moon was Buzz Lightyear.\\
171 - Ha!\\
172 - [doorbell rings]\\
173 - I'   ll get it!\\
174 - You got to admit that would'   ve been way cooler with a slide.\\
175 - Look who'   s here.Hi, guys.\\
176 - This is Louis.\\
177 - Hi, Louis!Sweet Lou!\\
178 - [bellows]: Lou!\\

183 - with them for the weekend.\\
184 - Oh, uh, don'   t worry, buddy,\\
185 - I was only supposed to stay here for a weekend, too.\\
186 - [singsongy]: 12 years later.\\
187 - WALDEN: Oh, and, uh,\\
188 - this is Berta. Uh, she helps\\
189 - take care of us around here.\\
190 - Look at that face.\\
191 - Walden, you might have some competition\\
192 - for the best looking man in the house.\\
193 - You mean so-some more competition?\\
194 - Nope.\\
195 - Do you have any Cheez-Its?\\
196 - Uh, well, if we don'   t, we could get some.\\
197 - Okay, I'   ll stay.\\
198 - All right, well, I want you guys\\
199 - to get to know each other, so I'   m gonna go.\\
200 - But you have my number if you need anything.Oh, uh, wait.\\
201 - Uh, does-does he come with an instruction manual or something?\\
202 - You'   ll be fine. Bye, Louis.\\
203 - Uh, okay, uh...\\
204 - should we have tipped her?\\
205 - You'   re asking me?\\
206 - I don'   t even tip the pizza guy.\\
207 - I don'   t like pizza.\\
208 - I like Cheez-Its.\\
209 - Oh, well, you know, when you think about it,\\
210 - a pizza is just a really big Cheez-It\\
211 - with sauce.\\
212 - We'   re gonna get Cheez-Its, right?\\
213 - Berta?\\
214 - I'   m on it.\\
215 - I'   ll be back as soon as I can.\\
216 - And, Louis?\\
217 - That'   s the first time I ever\\
218 - said that and meant it.\\
219 - Hey, Louis? Welcome to our house.\\
220 - Do you want to come on in?\\
221 - Oh, my God. Look at him. He'   s adorable.\\
222 - ALAN: I know, I know. He'   s like one of those TV kids.\\
223 - Maybe we can put him in commercials.\\
224 - We know he likes Cheez-Its.\\
225 - Alan, do you really want to be\\
226 - making less money than a six-year-old?\\
227 - Oh, oh, oh. Oh.\\
228 - Who is that?\\
229 - This is Timothy.\\
230 - He'   s a seal.\\
231 - Oh! Well, hi, Timothy.\\

234 - Timothy doesn'   t talk.\\
235 - Oh, right, yeah.\\
236 - Because he'   s a seal.\\
237 - No, because he'   s a toy.\\
238 - Right. He-He'   s a toy.\\
239 - [exhales]\\
240 - Wow. Got a lot of weekend left.\\
241 - So, which one of you is the mommy?\\
242 - Um...Um...\\
243 - well, that'   s-that'   s a great question.\\
244 - And one I was hoping you wouldn'   t ask\\
245 - in the first five minutes.\\
246 - You know, see, in some families,\\
247 - there'   s a mommy and a daddy.\\
248 - But in other families, like this one,\\
249 - there'   s, there'   s two daddies.\\
250 - Why?\\
251 - Wow, that is another great question.\\
252 - Um... Alan?\\
253 - No, no. You'   re doing great.\\
254 - Okay.\\

265 - Lucky. He never let me.\\
266 - Oh, and check this out.\\

316 - Oontz. Oontz. Oontz.\\
317 - Oontz. Oontz.\\
318 - Oh, my God, that was like pulling teeth.\\
319 - Please tell me this gets easier.\\
320 - It doesn'   t,\\

322 -     Men.   \\
323 - Hey, Louis, look at this.\\
324 - We'   re almost done.\\
325 - Yes, now all we need\\
326 - is a flag for the top.Oh!\\
327 - Oh, that'   s an old Band-Aid.\\
328 - Uh, how about this?\\
329 - We'   ll take this juice box,\\

334 - All hail\\
335 - the Kingdom of Mount Berry Cooler!\\
336 - ALAN: Oh, oh,\\
337 - and here comes the king, uh, returning home from battle.\\
338 - WALDEN: And what does he have with him?\\
339 - The spoils of war,\\
340 - all the Cheez-Its in the land.\\
341 - Isn'   t this cool, Louis?\\
342 - I want to go back inside.\\
343 - What?\\
344 - It'   s kind of hot,\\
345 - and I have to pee.\\
346 - Well, uh, you know,\\
347 - the ocean solves both of those problems.\\
348 - O-O-Okay.\\
349 - Okay, w-w-we'   ll meet you inside.\\
350 - Hey, hey, Berta, he'   s coming in!\\
351 - BERTA: I'   ve got him!\\
352 - Well, he hates me.\\
353 - What?\\
354 - We spent an hour\\
355 - building a sand castle,\\
356 - and all he did was dig a hole.\\
357 - Who digs holes, Alan?\\
358 - Prisoners, they want to escape.\\
359 - Oh, Walden.\\
360 - Why are the pretty ones always so crazy?\\
361 - Crazy? Am I?\\
362 - Really? What about earlier when he didn'   t want to unpack?\\
363 - What was that all about?\\
364 - Nobody likes to unpack. I hate it.\\
365 - Oh, is that why you'   ve never moved out?\\
366 - Wow.\\
367 - Um, misdirected anger,\\
368 - your table is ready.\\
369 - You know what, he doesn'   t want to be here.\\
370 - That'   s it.\\
371 - I-I knew I couldn'   t do this.\\
372 - Come on, Walden, put yourself in his shoes.\\
373 - He only spent half a day with us.\\
374 - He'   s gonna need more time to feel safe here.\\
375 - Yeah, right.\\
376 - More time.\\
377 - You think he'   ll love me by tomorrow?\\
378 - Trust me, Walden,\\
379 - he'   ll warm up to you just like I did.\\
380 - Remember when you moved here?\\
381 - I wasn'   t sure I wanted you to stay.\\
382 - I bought the house.\\
383 - And I made it a home.\\
384 - You'   re gonna have to have more patience with him.\\
385 - Fine.\\
386 - Patience.\\
387 - [groans]\\
388 - Where you going? The ocean.\\
389 - I'   m hot and I got to pee.\\
390 - Well, be careful.\\
391 - He hates me.\\
392 - Oh, there he is.\\
393 - Did you put the seat down?\\
394 - I never put it up.\\
395 - Can I have a snack?\\
396 - Do we have snacks?\\
397 - Let'   s see.\\
398 - Wow.\\
399 - Take a load off.\\
400 - When a guy named Charlie lived here,\\
401 - I had to keep this cabinet\\
402 - stocked with coke...\\
403 - ...co powder.\\
404 - Because he loved hot chocolate.\\
405 - I like hot chocolate.\\
406 - Not like he did.\\
407 - You like your crackers?\\
408 - Yeah.\\
409 - You don'   t talk much, do you?\\
410 - I get it.\\
411 - I was a quiet child.\\
412 - In fact,\\
413 - you and I have a lot in common.\\
414 - You like Cheez-Its, too?\\
415 - I do.\\
416 - But I was also raised\\
417 - in a whole bunch of foster homes.\\
418 - You were?\\
419 - Yep, and I hated it.\\
420 - Moving around all the time,\\
421 - having to make friends everywhere,\\
422 - and no one ever offered me grape juice.\\
423 - Would you like to have some grape juice?\\
424 - Yes, please.\\
425 - But I got to tell you,\\
426 - we both hit the lottery with this place.\\
427 - Walden and Alan\\
428 - are the best.\\
429 - They'   re nice,\\
430 - they'   re fun,\\
431 - and guess what else.\\
432 - What?\\
433 - They'   re easy to fool.\\
434 - Last year, I went to my granddaughter'   s graduation\\
435 - seven times.\\
436 - [laughter]\\
437 - And with that face...\\
438 - ...you can get anything you want.\\
439 - Welcome to Malibu, kid.\\
440 -     Men.   \\
441 - [knocking]\\
442 - Can I come in?\\
443 - What you drawing?\\
444 - Oh.\\
445 - A sand castle.\\
446 - That'   s ironic.\\
447 - Hey, uh, c-can we talk for a second?\\
448 - Sure. All right.\\
449 - Great.\\
450 - Look, uh...\\
451 - I know it'   s got to be overwhelming being here\\
452 - and being in new places all the time\\
453 - and with new people and a new bed.\\
454 - I mean, heck, for all you know,\\
455 - there could be monsters under the bed.\\
456 - There'   s monsters? No.\\
457 - That'   s a bad example.\\
458 - In fact, before you got here,\\
459 - I de-monsterized the entire house.\\
460 - My point is, is...\\
461 - I'   m really glad you'   re here, Louis.\\
462 - I just want you to be comfortable\\
463 - with Alan and I.\\
464 - So if, so if there'   s anything you ever need to talk about,\\
465 - like anything at all, you can come to me.\\
466 - So, that'   s all I have to say.\\
467 - Is there anything you would like to say?\\
468 - Nope.\\
469 - Really.\\
470 - Just, like, just nothing?\\
471 - Like, nothing at all?\\
472 - Can I ask you a question?\\
473 - Uh, yes, of course.\\
474 - You can just, any time.\\
475 - That-That'   s why I'   m here.\\
476 - So you just ask away.\\
477 - Is it okay that I can draw by myself for a little while?\\
478 - Yeah.\\
479 - Okay, yeah.\\
480 - You-you want to be alone.\\
481 - I get that.\\
482 - That is not a problem.\\
483 - So, you want your space,\\
484 - and I shall give it to you.\\
485 - I will withdraw while you draw.\\
486 - [chuckles]\\
487 - Son of a bitch.\\
488 -     Men.   \\
489 - Walden?\\
490 - [gasps] Oh, God.\\
491 - Oh, Louis.\\
492 - Oh, hey.\\
493 - [groans]\\
494 - What'   s going on, man?\\
495 - It'   s really late.\\
496 - I had a question, and you said we could talk any time.\\
497 - Well, that'   s-that'   s just\\
498 - something that people say,\\
499 - but, I, uh...\\
500 - Yeah, what-what'   s up?\\
501 - Am I gonna stay here with you?\\
502 - What do you mean?\\
503 - Sometimes I go to a house for a weekend,\\
504 - but then I don'   t stay.\\
505 - Oh, buddy, that'   s what you'   re worried about.\\
506 - Well, come here, c-come here, okay?\\
507 - Jump up here.\\
508 - Hey, listen.\\
509 - You can stay here as long as you want to.\\
510 - Do you want to?\\
511 - Uh-huh. I really like it here.\\
512 - That'   s... great.\\
513 - Really surprising, but it'   s great.\\
514 - Hey,\\
515 - I'   m not going anywhere,\\
516 - and as long as you want to be here,\\
517 - you'   re not going anywhere, either.\\
518 - And believe me, Alan is gonna be here longer than the both of us.\\
519 - So don'   t you worry.\\
520 - Thanks.\\
521 - So you really like it here, huh?\\
522 - All right, what was the best part of the day?\\
523 - BOTH: The Cheez-Its.\\
524 - Yeah.\\
525 - And I like Berta.\\
526 - Berta'   s great,\\
527 - and you like me, too, right?\\
528 - Berta'   s so funny.\\
529 - Patience, patience.\\
530 - Listen,\\
531 - as long as you'   re happy.\\
532 - Cool.\\
533 - It is cool, Louis.\\
534 - It'   s very cool.\\
535 - Where'   s Alan?\\
536 - Look at us.\\
537 - We'   re like the Three Musketeers.\\
538 - I don'   t think the Three Musketeers\\
539 - shared a bed.\\
540 - You don'   t know that.\\
541 - They were French.\\
542 - Where'   s Berta?\\
543 - No.\\
544 -     Men.   \\
545 -     Men.   \\
546 - And then you pull the bird back,Uh-huh.\\
547 - and then let them go fly into the pig'   s house.\\
548 - And then they roll around, and then they explode.\\
549 - And then it'   s fun.\\
550 - Angry Birds sounds like it'   s fun.\\
551 - You know, I bet the birds are so angry\\
552 - '   cause they don'   t get enough sleep.\\
553 - It'   s the pigs who should be angry.\\
554 - The birds are always crashing into their house,\\
555 - even when they build them out of ice or in space.\\
556 - I wonder if the pigs are from Three Little Pigs.\\
557 - That'   s messed up because the wolf already broke\\
558 - their old houses.\\

17 - Ooh, what'   d she say?\\
18 - She sounds pretty.\\
19 - She said, "Alan, your fly is open."\\
20 - Oh. Oh!\\

36 - we were gonna get a divorce right after.\\
37 - But now, if we become Louis'   s foster parents,\\
38 - we'   re gonna have to be together for a minimum of six months.\\
39 - Uh, not that I'   m complaining.\\
40 - This is the happiest and most loving of any\\
41 - of my three marriages.\\
42 - I'   m thinking it would just be the opposite\\
43 - of when Jake was here.\\
44 - You were the dad, and I occasionally imparted wisdom,\\
45 - like... the skull and crossbones on a bottle\\
46 - underneath the sink doesn'   t mean that it'   s pirate juice.\\
47 - Okay, well, uh, uh,\\

62 - it'   s pronounced... [speaks Mandarin Chinese]\\
63 - What you asked for is a lap dance.\\

70 - I'   m Walden.\\
71 - Oh, and, uh, this is Louis and Alan.\\
72 - Hi.Nice to meet you.\\
73 - So, you'   re teaching Louis Mandarin?\\
74 - Well, I bought him, uh, an app for 99 cents,\\
75 - so, yeah, I'   m teaching him.\\
76 - [laughs]\\
77 - Well, I speak fluent Mandarin, so if you need any help\\
78 - with anything...\\
79 - give me a call.\\
80 - Ah, well, I could always use a helping hand.\\
81 - [chuckles]\\
82 - [speaking Mandarin Chinese]\\
83 - Oh. Oh!\\
84 - Nice meeting you.\\
85 - What happened?\\
86 - What did you say?\\
87 - He said, "They'   re married."\\
88 - And if he hadn'   t, I was about to.\\
89 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
90 -     Ah.     Men.     Men.\\
91 -     Men.   \\
92 - How'   s it going out there?\\
93 - I don'   t know. I'   m trying to read their lips.\\
94 - He either said, "I really like it here,"\\
95 - or "I'   d really like a beer."\\
96 - I-I'   m sure he'   s saying good things.\\
97 - You know, how-how you'   re teaching him Chinese,\\
98 - how I'   m teaching him environmental awareness.\\
99 - You taught him to pee in the shower to save water.\\
100 - And you know what our Mother Earth says to that?\\
101 - Xiexie.\\
102 - I got to tell you, I'   ve already grown attached to this kid.\\
103 - And if she does try to take him away,\\
104 - I know a guy who can get him back.\\
105 - You'   re kidding, right?\\
106 - Right, kidding.\\
107 - But if I find an envelope in my car with, say, two grand in it,\\
108 - I have no way of knowing where it came from.\\
109 - Can I talk to you guys for a second?\\
110 - Uh, yeah, sure.\\
111 - Uh, Berta, could you watch Louis?\\
112 - Absolutely.\\
113 - We'   ll be in the car with the engine running.\\
114 - No reason.\\
115 - So, I talked to Louis about his weekend here.\\
116 - Uh, did he answer you in English or Mandarin?\\
117 - English.\\
118 - Though I'   m very impressed you'   re teaching him Chinese.\\
119 - And to pee in the shower.\\
120 - That'   s mine.\\
121 - I'   m also teaching him to dance like no one is watching.\\
122 - Well, he seems to have settled in nicely.\\
123 - He feels very happy and safe with you guys,\\
124 - so I see no reason why I shouldn'   t approve you\\
125 - to be Louis'   s foster parents.\\
126 - Really? Are you serious?\\
127 - I rarely lie about these things.\\
128 - I did it once, and it did not go well.\\
129 - This-this is great!\\
130 - I-I know. I-I'   ve never been approved for anything, ever.\\
131 - Bite me, Discover Card.\\
132 - Congratulations! Thank you!\\
133 - This is my favorite part of the job.\\
134 - Well, that and doughnut Friday.\\
135 - Oh, God, my life is empty.\\
136 - Oh, wait, d-does Louis know?\\
137 - No, he thinks I'   m happy.\\
138 - Oh, you mean about him here.\\
139 - Uh, no, you should tell him.\\
140 - But before you do, just remember,\\
141 - kids who'   ve been in the foster system as long as he has can be\\
142 - a little withdrawn or manipulative,\\
143 - so don'   t be surprised if he acts out.\\
144 - It'   s okay. I was a rebel when I was a kid.\\
145 - One night, I took my mom'   s car for a joyride.\\
146 - [chuckles] The cops would have never caught me\\
147 - if the library hadn'   t been closed.\\
148 - Well, call me if you need anything.\\
149 - I got to run. I got to hit the craft store.\\
150 - I am making each one of my cats a Christmas stocking.\\
151 - I should have stopped at "I got to run."\\
152 - Anyway, congratulations.\\
153 - Oh, hey, uh, Louis, could you come in here?\\
154 - Oh, my God, we should tell him he can'   t stay.\\
155 - How funny would that be?\\
156 - I'   ll follow your lead.\\
157 - Hey, Louis, um,\\
158 - so Ms. McMartin said\\
159 - that you like it here and you want to stay.\\
160 - I do.\\
161 - Well, we told her\\
162 - that we want you to stay,\\
163 - and she said... okay!\\
164 - Really? Cool!\\
165 - Yeah. We should celebrate.\\
166 - Can we get pizza, Zippy?\\
167 - [Berta laughs]\\
168 - That turned out funnier than I thought it would.\\
169 -     Men.\\
170 - You know, when my son was your age,\\
171 - we used to play video games just like this.\\
172 - Really? Yes, and I used to let him win,\\
173 - just like I'   m letting you win...\\
174 - [cars crashing over TV]Hey!\\
175 - How'   d you blow up my car?!\\
176 - All right, Louis, time to get ready for bed.\\
177 - Five more minutes?\\
178 - No. You know the deal.\\
179 - One hour of video games a night. Now it'   s bedtime.\\
180 - Aw, no fair.\\
181 - Well, life isn'   t fair.\\
182 - Look at my face, look at his.\\
183 - All right, I'   m gonna go run you a bath.\\
184 - Put your dishes in the sink and put away the controllers.\\
185 - And, Louis, you help him.\\
186 - Oh, I know you'   re upset, but rules are important.\\
187 - It'   s just, we never got to play video games in the group home.\\
188 - Oh, of course.\\
189 - The group home.\\
190 - Okay, what if we just snuck in a few more minutes?\\
191 - Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah, but, uh...\\
192 - but you can'   t tell Walden,\\
193 - and we have to play it really quietly.\\
194 - [quietly]: You'   re the coolest.\\
195 - [gasps] I'   m the cool dad.\\
196 - [whispers]: I'   m the cool dad.\\
197 -     Men.\\
198 - Oh, hey there, kiddo.\\
199 - How'   d you sleep?\\
200 - With my eyes closed.\\
201 - Ah, kicking it old school.\\
202 - I respect that.\\
203 - Can I have breakfast?\\
204 - Sure. How about some oatmeal?\\
205 - Cookies!\\
206 - Well, do you like oatmeal cookies? Yes.\\
207 - Well, this is a sugarless oatmeal cookie\\
208 - in wet, pasty form.\\
209 - Why can'   t I have cookies?\\
210 - Well, because cookies aren'   t breakfast food.\\
211 - And remember what Walden said about eating healthy.\\
212 - Yeah, I know.\\
213 - My last foster family wouldn'   t give me cookies either.\\
214 - Oh.\\
215 - I suppose one wouldn'   t hurt.\\
216 - Thanks. [chuckles]\\
217 - WALDEN: Hey, Louis, are you up yet?\\
218 - Oh. Uh, in here!\\
219 - [quietly]: Eat it. Wipe your mouth.\\
220 - Chocolate lips sink ships.\\
221 - [singsongy]: Morning.\\
222 - Morning. Just making Louis some oatmeal.\\
223 - That'   s good, '   cause we got a big day for you, big guy.\\
224 - I got a bunch of errands to run,\\
225 - but Alan is gonna take you to the store\\
226 - and buy you a new backpack.\\
227 - I saw one that looks just like Yoda.\\
228 - [imitates Yoda]: To school you will wear it.\\
229 - Okay. Hmm.\\
230 - What are you eating?\\
231 - Show it to me.\\
232 - Is that a cookie?\\
233 - Where did you get a cookie?\\
234 - Louis, where did you get a cookie?\\
235 - Hey, uh, Louis, why don'   t you go get dressed\\
236 - and-and I'   ll make you some oatmeal,\\
237 - and then you can get going.\\
238 - Okay.\\
239 - Oh, and-and don'   t forget\\
240 - to brush your teeth.\\
241 - And-and wash your hands.\\
242 - Oh, and put on clean underwear.\\
243 - Clean underwear?\\
244 - We'   re going to Target, not the White House.\\
245 - Why would you give him a cookie for breakfast?\\
246 - I couldn'   t help it. He gave me orphan face.\\
247 - [Cockney accent]: Please, sir, can I have a cookie?\\
248 - Me tum-tum is all empty and growly.\\
249 - When it comes to Louis, we have to be a team.\\
250 - If I make a rule, you got to have my back.\\
251 - You'   re right, you'   re right, and-and from now on,\\
252 - I will ignore him like I ignore all those calls\\
253 - from the collection agency.\\
254 - Great. Okay, now, please,\\
255 - today, just take him to the store,\\
256 - get him a backpack, and then bring him home.\\
257 - I want to do something fun later.\\
258 - A hint: has to do with miniature golf\\
259 - and it rhymes with "what-what."\\
260 - That sounds great.\\
261 - I'   ll, uh, take him out right after breakfast.\\
262 - And while you'   re out, get some more of these cookies.\\
263 - [Cockney accent]: They make me tum-tum all smiley, governor.\\
264 - See, I can do accents.\\
265 -     Men.   \\
266 - Okay. Okay, here'   s the fun part. Wait. Wait.\\
267 -     Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto\\
268 -     Domo     Domo\\
269 -     Domo     Domo\\
270 -     Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto    \\
271 -     Domo       Domo   \\
272 -     Domo.       Domo.   \\
273 - [music continues]\\
274 - I like that song. It'   s about robots.\\
275 - Yup. If you have to have one cassette stuck in your dash,\\
276 - make it Styx.\\
277 - Look, laser tag! Can we go?\\
278 - Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, no.\\
279 - We'   re just gonna go buy a backpack and go straight home.\\
280 - Please?\\
281 - Oh, no, do not give me that face.\\
282 - It is not gonna work.\\
283 - I thought you were cool.\\
284 - Well... I suppose one game of laser tag couldn'   t hurt.\\
285 - Awesome!\\
286 - But it has to be a...\\
287 - [turns up music]\\
288 -     Secret, secret\\
289 - BOTH:     I got a secret...\\
290 -     Men.   \\
291 - [kids laughing, lasers firing]\\
292 - [laughs]\\
293 - Go tell your mommies you got shot by CoolDad47.\\
294 - Hey, hey, who hit me?\\
295 - I got you.Oh. I'   m gonna get you.\\
296 - I'   m gonna get you.\\
297 - Yeah, yeah, you better run.\\
298 - Better run faster.\\
299 - [thump]LOUIS: Ow, my head!\\
300 - Louis?\\
301 - Louis, are you okay?\\
302 - Hey, whoa, whoa!\\
303 - Wait, wait, don'   t shoot! Uh, my kid is hurt.\\
304 - Ha, ha. Sucker.\\
305 -     Men.   \\
306 -     Men.   \\
307 - Hey. I got here as quick as I could.\\
308 - Are you okay, buddy? What happened?\\
309 - He'   s fine. It'   s typical kid stuff, you know?\\
310 - He was running a little too fast,\\
311 - and he tripped and bumped his head.\\
312 - And then Alan shot a little girl.\\
313 - What?We played laser tag.\\
314 -     Secret, secret\\
315 -     It was a secret.\\
316 - Alan, can I talk to you in the hallway?\\
317 - Ooh, you'   re in trouble.\\
318 - I really hope you have a good explanation\\
319 - for taking him to laser tag.\\
320 - Uh, okay, j-just out of curiosity,\\
321 - um, uh, what, in your opinion,\\
322 - would qualify as a good explanation?\\
323 - I don'   t know. Y-Your car broke down\\
324 - outside of the place.\\
325 - And then the tornado was coming, so you took shelter inside.\\
326 - And then once you got in there, you contracted a rare disease\\
327 - that could only be cured by playing laser tag.\\
328 - Wow, it'   s like you were there.\\
329 - What the hell, man?\\
330 - You said you had my back.\\
331 - Why do you keep doing this?\\
332 - He thinks I'   m cool.\\
333 - I mean, when Jake was a kid,\\
334 - he thought Charlie was the cool one.\\
335 - When you moved in, Jake thought you were the cool one.\\
336 - Now it'   s my turn.\\
337 - Louis thinks I'   m Al-Al Cool Dad.\\
338 - No, he doesn'   t.\\
339 - He'   s using this\\
340 - to manipulate you just like Ms. McMartin said he would.\\
341 - Oh, so the-the only possible reason that someone\\
342 - would like me is because they'   re trying to manipulate me?\\
343 - Yes, that'   s right!\\
344 - You'   re not Al-Al Cool Dad, you'   re just Weird Al.\\
345 - Okay, first of all,\\
346 - that'   s a compliment to a lover of puns.\\
347 - Secondly, you'   re overreacting.\\
348 - Overreacting?\\
349 - [quietly]: I asked you to get Louis a backpack.\\
350 - Instead you got him stitches!\\
351 - Uh, actually, it'   s a liquid band.\\
352 - Shut up!\\
353 - Louis is fine.\\
354 - Kids get hurt all the time, especially boys.\\
355 - Jake was constantly banging his head.Okay,\\
356 - I really don'   t think you should be using Jake as an example.\\
357 - Oh, so what are you saying? That I did a bad job raising my son?\\
358 - Jake is great, but he did just send you a photo from Tokyo\\
359 - and said-- and I quote-- "Look at what a great job they did\\
360 - rebuilding the city after Godzilla."\\
361 - Okay, I may not be the best parent in the world,\\
362 - but at least I found a woman willing to have a kid with me.\\
363 - Okay, you know what, we should drop this.\\
364 - Like you did Jake, on his head, repeatedly.\\
365 - Yeah. I don'   t have to take this.\\
366 - So I am just gonna walk away.\\
367 - Like every woman you'   ve ever dated.\\
368 - Oh, no, you'   re gonna walk away?\\
369 - Well, when am I gonna see you again?\\
370 - Oh, I know. In 20 minutes,\\
371 - at my house, where you live rent-free.\\
372 - Proctology is on the eighth floor, Walden!\\
373 - In case you'   d like to get that stick removed.\\
374 - Al-Al Cool Dad, out.\\
375 -     Men.   \\
376 - Morning.\\
377 - Morning.\\
378 - I want you to know I spent a lot of time thinking\\
379 - about everything last night.\\
380 - And?\\
381 - And I think an apology is sufficient.\\
382 - I don'   t need a gift.\\
383 - Although I certainly wouldn'   t refuse\\
384 - a new panini press.\\
385 - That'   s a great idea.\\
386 - You know, if I bought you a panini press,\\
387 - would you smash your balls between the hot metal grates?\\
388 - Oh, okay.\\
389 - I see I'   m the only one capable of being a mature adult,\\
390 - so to you I say...\\
391 - [blows raspberry]\\
392 - You spit on me.\\
393 - Oh, did I?\\
394 - [blows raspberry]\\
395 - Okay.\\
396 - Let'   s go. [blows raspberry]\\
397 - [blows raspberry]\\
398 - [both blowing raspberries]\\
399 - Can I play, too?\\
400 - [blows raspberry]\\
401 - Hey, buddy, uh, you'   re already finished with your chores?\\
402 - Yup, I made my bed.\\
403 - What a responsible young man.\\
404 - I asked you to do something and you did it.\\
405 - And he'   s six.\\
406 - Hey, uh, buddy, now that you'   re finished with your chores,\\
407 - what do you say we go bowling, huh?\\
408 - Doesn'   t that sound fun?\\
409 - We get to wear other people'   s shoes.\\
410 - Can Alan come?\\
411 - Oh...\\
412 - Alan already wears other people'   s shoes.\\
413 - I actually have to go to the grocery store, anyway.\\
414 - Do you know what else would be fun?\\
415 - Hey, anything you want to do.\\
416 - Let'   s go to the grocery store with Alan.\\
417 - [blows raspberry]\\
418 -     Men.   \\
419 - Can I get Pop Tarts?\\
420 - [French accent]: Ah, Pop Tarts.\\
421 - This is a wonderful choice.\\
422 - Might I suggest the classic strawberry?\\
423 - Is best by 2016.\\
424 - This is an excellent year.\\
425 - Anything for the lady?\\
426 - Perhaps a glass of kiss my shir-ass.\\
427 - Oh, oh.\\
428 - What do you got there, buddy?\\
429 - I want Froot Loops.\\
430 - You know, we only get one special treat.\\
431 - So if you want those, we got to put the Pop Tarts back.\\
432 - But I want both.\\
433 - Well, here'   s the thing: we can'   t have both.\\
434 - So... that'   s the rule.\\
435 - Ooh, this should be good.\\
436 - Okay, Louis...\\
437 - you heard what I said.\\
438 - You can'   t have these.\\
439 - Oh, Snap...\\
440 - Crackle and Pop.\\
441 - What are you doing?\\
442 - I want Froot Loops.\\
443 - Okay, I'   m gonna count to three,\\
444 - and if you don'   t get up, you'   re gonna be in big trouble.\\
445 - Ooh, counting. This is some groundbreaking stuff.\\
446 - One...\\
447 - ...two...\\
448 - ...three.\\
449 - One...\\
450 - One and a half...\\
451 - Well, you clearly have this under control.\\
452 - I'   m gonna go check out the cuties in the produce section.\\
453 - And I may or may not be talking about the tangerines.\\
454 - You hear that, Louis? He'   s leaving.\\
455 - And I, now, I guess,\\
456 - now I'   m leaving, so...\\
457 - unless you want to live here in the cereal aisle,\\
458 - I suggest you get up.\\
459 - All right, okay. Here we go, then.\\
460 - Have fun. [chuckles]\\
461 - I hope Captain Crunch can put you through college.\\
462 - Next stop is the checkout aisle.\\
463 - That'   s it.\\
464 - I am not kidding, I mean it. I am leaving.\\
465 - ALAN [imitating P.A.]: Attention shoppers,\\
466 - we are having a two-for-one sale\\
467 - on meaningless threats in aisle five.\\
468 - Can you help me out here?Help? Oh, oh.\\
469 - You want me to help?\\
470 - Well, I suppose I could drop him on his head repeatedly.\\
471 - Okay, you know what, I deserve that.\\
472 - Yesterday I said some things that I regret.\\
473 - Mm. Like what?God, do we have to do this now?\\
474 - Why not? I'   m not going anywhere.\\
475 - Clearly, he'   s not going anywhere.\\
476 - Okay, fine, I said that-that you'   re not a very good father.\\
477 - And that is simply not true.\\
478 - Thank you.\\
479 - That must have been hard for you to say.\\
480 - And Jake is a very bright and capable young man.\\
481 - And that must have been damn near impossible to say.\\
482 - But... very sweet.\\
483 - Um, I shouldn'   t have gone behind your back with Louis.\\
484 - But it just, it felt so good that he wanted to be with me.\\
485 - And I'   ve never been anybody'   s first pick before.\\
486 - You were my first pick to help me raise a kid.\\
487 - Clean up on aisle five.\\
488 - The floor'   s about to be covered in tears.\\
489 - Okay. Can-Can you give me a hand here?\\
490 - Okay, I'   ve seen this a million times before.\\
491 - There is one surefire parental technique that always works.\\
492 - He wanted Froot Loops.\\
493 - We'   re good parents. We really are.\\
494 -     Men.   \\
495 -     Men.   Louis is all tucked in.\\
496 - Oh, yeah?\\
497 - No extra bedtime story?\\
498 - No secret dessert?\\
499 - No dancing like no one'   s watching?\\
500 - No jazz hands were raised, no heels were kicked.\\
501 - I appreciate that.I got your back.\\
502 - And to say thank you,\\
503 - I got you a special surprise.\\
504 - [gasps] Froot Loops!\\

1 - Ugh.\\
2 - How is it possible\\
3 - that kids weigh twice as much when they'   re asleep?\\
4 - I know.\\
5 - And he should weigh less after his little mishap\\
6 - on the spinning teacups.\\
7 - Yeah.\\
8 - Felt bad for that girl in the Cinderella costume\\
9 - in the cup behind us.\\
10 - She was right in the splash zone.\\
11 - [groans] I'   m exhausted.\\
12 - Me, too.\\
13 - I'   m also sticky and dirty and sweaty and slimy.\\
14 - I'   m like the seven dwarfs of disgusting.\\
15 - Ugh, I should not have eaten that funnel cake.\\
16 - [groans]\\
17 - Well, I see your funnel cake\\
18 - and raise you a deep-fried Snickers stuffed into a Twinkie.\\
19 - I think I blacked out briefly.\\
20 - [both groaning]\\
21 - Is being a dad always this tiring?\\
22 - These are the best moments of your life.\\
23 - And they are over so fast.\\
24 - Seems like only yesterday,\\
25 - Jake was holding my hand in the haunted house.\\
26 - Now he'   s half a world away in the army,\\
27 - wondering if a "dishonorable discharge" is something you get\\
28 - from a dirty geisha.\\
29 - So sweet.\\
30 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
31 -     Ah.     Men.     Men.\\

40 - Is it okay if I can make breakfast?\\
41 - Sure.\\
42 - Thanks.\\

52 -     Men.   \\
53 - Walden?\\
54 - Ready or not, here I come.\\
55 - What?\\
56 - Louis and I, we'   re playing hide and seek.\\
57 - He'   s under his bed, hiding\\
58 - and I'   m in the kitchen, seeking sleep.\\
59 - I hear ya.\\
60 - I barely got my eight hours.\\
61 - I don'   t know if I can handle this.\\
62 - Little boys have a lot of energy.\\
63 - They'   re like cute little crackheads.\\
64 - Except crackheads have better toilet aim.\\
65 - No, no, this isn'   t about being tired.\\
66 - I just, I don'   t know if I'   m cut out to be a dad.\\
67 - Hey, I didn'   t think I could live\\
68 - in a Malibu beach house for free,\\
69 - but I figured it out.\\
70 - Well, I don'   t know if I can figure this out.\\
71 - I mean, th-this kid has bounced around\\
72 - the foster care system his whole life.\\
73 - I mean, I-I don'   t know what he needs.\\
74 - I mean, does he need structure?\\
75 - Does he need freedom?\\
76 - Does he need medication?\\
77 - I should have asked that before they dropped him off.\\
78 - All he needs is your love and support.\\
79 - [imitates Alan mockingly]\\
80 - That'   s a bunch of crap.\\
81 - Walden, every parent goes through this.\\
82 - B-But you'   re actually doing a great job.\\
83 - You'   re just overwhelmed because this is all so new,\\
84 - a-and you'   re trying to be everything to him all the time.\\
85 - You know, full-time dad, full-time playmate.\\
86 - You have to give yourself a break.\\
87 - How?\\
88 - He'   s 24-7.\\
89 - He'   s like the Energizer bunny.\\
90 - You know why you never met the Energizer bunny'   s dad?\\
91 - '   Cause one night, he went out for cigarettes,\\
92 - and he just kept going and going and going.\\
93 - One thing that'   ll help is getting Louis some friends.\\
94 - Playdates.\\
95 - They chase each other around for hours,\\
96 - eventually they pass out like work dogs.\\
97 - Kid'   ll be in bed by 8:00,\\
98 - then it'   s you, me, a bowl of popcorn\\
99 - and binge-watching The Good Wife.\\
100 - Okay, so what?\\
101 - So, I just... I'   ll just Google a place\\
102 - to meet a fun cute six-year-old.\\
103 - Oh, yeah. No.\\
104 - I heard it when I said it.\\
105 -     Men.   \\
106 - Uh, this place is awesome.\\
107 - They have a rock wall.\\
108 - Will you climb it with me?\\
109 - Oh, buddy, you know, the whole idea is for you to come here\\
110 - and meet all these other kids.\\
111 - No, just you and me.\\
112 - Please?\\
113 - Oh.\\
114 - All right, I mean, come on.\\
115 - How do you say no to those eyes?I hear ya.\\
116 - Oh, uh, hey, can I have some money for the snack bar?\\
117 - Please? No.\\
118 - It'   s not my fault you already spent all your allowance.\\
119 - Room for one more?\\
120 - Absolutely.\\
121 - Care for a juice box?\\
122 - We have cherry, grape and Chardonnay.\\
123 - Well, what else can I say except, "chardonn-yay."\\
124 - Uh, I am Alan.\\
125 - Uh, that'   s Louis over there, he'   s mine.\\
126 - I'   m Danielle, and that'   s my daughter in the water wings.\\
127 - Oh, is there a pool here?No.\\
128 - At some point, you just pick your battles.\\
129 - I'   m Laurel, this is Julie.\\
130 - Oh, hot dad on the rock wall.\\
131 - I claim this as Mount Louis!\\
132 - Wow, he'   s really cute.\\
133 - Big time.\\
134 - Sorry, ladies.\\
135 - He'   s taken.\\
136 - No kidding? Good for you.\\
137 - How'   d you snag him?\\
138 - I met him at a low point in his life, and I took care of him.\\
139 - And he'   s been taking care of me every day since.\\
140 - [oohing, giggling]\\
141 - That'   s the kind of man I need.\\
142 - No, that'   s the kind of man I need.\\
143 - You'   re married.\\
144 - Yeah, to Roger.\\
145 - He hasn'   t screwed me since the prenup.\\
146 - BOTH: Classic Julie.\\
147 - Oh, this is so Sex and the City right now.\\
148 - Alan, do we have any wipes?\\
149 - The kid above me dripped something on my face.\\
150 - The best-case scenario is snot.\\
151 - Here, I'   ve got some.\\
152 - Oh, thank you.\\
153 - Walden, this is, uh, Laurel, Danielle and Julie.\\
154 - The ladies, the gals.\\
155 - The juice box heroes.\\
156 - Hi.\\
157 - Hello.\\
158 - Hi, nice to meet you all.\\
159 - Your son is adorable.\\
160 - I'   m his husband, silly.\\
161 - So, uh, which one'   s yours?\\
162 - My daughter, Lily,\\
163 - is the one licking that little boy.\\
164 - Sweetie, we don'   t lick strangers!\\
165 - Oh, and I thought we were gonna be friends.\\
166 - All right.\\
167 - I'   m headed to the ball pit.\\
168 - Same thing he said as he dove under the covers last night.\\
169 - Boing.\\
170 -     Men.   \\
171 - Thanks for having us.\\
172 - I got to say, this is a great spot for a playdate.\\
173 - This view is amazing.\\
174 - Yes. Yes, it is.\\
175 - You know, I used to walk by houses like this\\
176 - and think the people on the decks were just looking\\
177 - down their noses at everyone, feeling all superior.\\
178 - Now I know it'   s true.\\
179 - Roger sold our beach house\\
180 - '   cause he said we never used it.\\
181 - Using that logic, we should sell his penis.\\
182 - [laughs]\\
183 - Classic Julie.\\
184 - Hey, w-we should make this a regular thing.\\
185 - [thudding, shattering]\\
186 - Oh. Yeah, next time we'   ll do it at one of your houses.\\
187 - Hey, uh, Louis, is everything okay?\\
188 - Over.\\
189 - LOUIS: Lego tower fell over.\\
190 - Uh, you didn'   t say "over."\\
191 - Over.\\
192 - I said the Lego tower fell over.\\
193 - Over.\\
194 - You'   re so good with him. Over.\\
195 - Actually, I-I feel like I have no idea what I'   m doing.\\
196 - Join the club.\\
197 - Parenting'   s like a yoga class.\\
198 - You just do what everybody else is doing\\
199 - and try not to laugh when someone farts.\\
200 - Okay, so all the kids are playing in Louis'    room.\\
201 - Well, technically, three of them are playing together,\\
202 - and Louis is in the corner, coloring by himself.\\
203 - That'   s perfectly normal.\\
204 - The parenting books call it "parallel play."\\
205 - Oh, that'   s good to know.\\
206 - So, in high school, I wasn'   t such a weirdo.\\
207 - I was just a parallel player.\\
208 - My sex life with my first wife was a lot of parallel play.\\
209 - Just give Louis time.\\
210 - Remember, this is all new for him.\\
211 - Kind of like learning on my honeymoon\\
212 - that I wasn'   t going to have sex was all new for me.\\
213 - You know, I just want him to have friends.\\
214 - You know, like a couple girls, and a couple boys.\\
215 - He'   s gonna be fine.\\
216 - In the meantime, Ihave made some friends\\
217 - who have welcomed me into the secret world of women.\\
218 - I am this close to discovering everything about them.\\
219 - What they like, what they don'   t like.\\
220 - And where they don'   t like it.\\
221 - We'   re supposed to be here helping Louis make friends.\\
222 - Oh, please, I see how you look at Laurel.\\
223 - It'   s the same way I look at a five dollar bill in a tip jar\\
224 - I think I can swap out for a single.\\
225 - Okay, what are you talking about?\\
226 - That is Louis'    friend'   s mom.\\
227 - And, yes, we get along great.\\
228 - And, yes, she'   s pretty and nice.\\
229 - And, yes, she used to be a gymnast and can still\\
230 - put her legs behind her head.\\
231 - And she is out there.\\
232 - So why am I still standing here, talking to you?\\
233 - I can put my legs behind my head, but you'   ll never see it.\\
234 -     Men.   \\
235 - He was a really nice guy, Mm-hmm.\\
236 - and I liked hanging out with him,\\
237 - but when we got to the bedroom,\\
238 - he was just, well...\\
239 - If he were a candy bar, he'   d be the fun size.\\
240 - There'   s nothing fun about that.\\
241 - Yeah, nothing worse than a small penis.\\
242 - But, seriously, how small is too small?\\
243 - Alan, you are a riot.\\
244 - We should hang out with you more often.\\
245 - Hey, what do you say, we all go out\\
246 - this Saturday for a girls night?\\
247 - You know, get a limo, go out dancing,\\
248 - wear our sluttiest outfits.\\
249 - Julie, you can wear what you'   re wearing now.\\
250 - Uh, I'   m bad.\\
251 - Should we go check on the kids?\\
252 - Are you kidding?\\
253 - They'   re set up with pizza, popsicles and The Lego Movie.\\
254 - For the next two hours,\\
255 -     Everything is awesome.\\
256 - Yeah, I'   ve seen that movie, like, five times.\\
257 - I should really watch it with Louis at some point.\\
258 - I haven'   t seen a movie\\
259 - that wasn'   t for a kid in forever.\\
260 - The other night I actually had a sex dream\\
261 - about an animated character.\\
262 - Whoa...\\
263 - Prince Charming?\\
264 - The old guy from Up.\\
265 - And, sadly, it was the only sex I'   ve had in two years.\\
266 - Well, if it meant a whole night'   s sleep,\\
267 - I'   d have sex with an animated Ed Asner, too.\\
268 - You think you'   re tired now.\\
269 - You missed the hardest years.\\
270 - The-the... the picky eating, the tantrums, the bed-wetting.\\
271 - Okay, to be fair, I get all of that with Alan.\\
272 - You guys are a great team.Hmm.\\
273 - The only thing my ex would help with\\
274 - was driving the babysitter home.\\
275 - She'   d have the kids in bed by 8:00\\
276 - and my husband in bed by 10:00.\\
277 - Oh... that'   s horrible.\\
278 - Is she a good sitter? '   Cause we'   re looking.\\
279 - Sorry.\\
280 - Without that jerk of an ex,\\
281 - I wouldn'   t have Lily,\\
282 - and even at six years old, she'   s my best friend.\\
283 - I hope I get there with Louis at some point.\\
284 - You'   ll get there.\\
285 - I hope I stay there with Lily.\\
286 - I'   m afraid that by the time she'   s a teenager,\\
287 - she'   ll be like, "Mom, you'   re 100!\\
288 - Nobody believes I'   m your sister!"\\
289 - Okay, how could anyone say that\\
290 - about someone as pretty, smart and flexible as you?\\
291 - [laughs]\\
292 - You'   re so sweet.\\
293 - You don'   t happen to know\\
294 - of a single, straight version of you, do you?\\
295 - I used to know one.\\
296 - Are you looking for a date?\\
297 - I told you, it'   s been over two years.\\
298 - I need a lot more than a date.\\
299 -     Popsicles are awesome!\\
300 - Okay, I'   m gonna go check on the kids.\\
301 - I'   m gonna wait here for a bit.\\
302 -     Men.   \\
303 -     Men.   \\
304 - Hope you are ready to go.\\
305 - The ladies just Instagrammed\\
306 - a selfie from the limo.\\
307 - #GirlsNightOut is on like Chaka Khan!\\
308 - All right, Louis is eating his dinner.\\
309 - WALDEN: Oh, great.\\
310 - Hey, thank you again for watching him tonight.\\
311 - And if anything comes up--\\
312 - and I mean anything at all-- you call my cell.\\
313 - Got it.\\
314 - Oh, if he wants to play a game,\\
315 - he likes Chutes and Ladders.\\
316 - And if he want to watch a cartoon,\\
317 - he likes Phineas and Ferb.\\
318 - And who does he like in the Cardinals-Rams game tonight?\\
319 - I know I'   m being a little bit crazy,\\
320 - but this is the first time I'   ve left him alone.\\
321 - Relax, I had five kids,\\
322 - 12 grandkids and four great-grandkids.\\
323 - I'   ve done it all.\\
324 - Except teach them about birth control.\\
325 - I don'   t feel good.\\
326 - Oh, no. What'   s the matter?\\
327 - I just threw up.\\
328 - Oh, no. Oh... yep.\\
329 - He'   s got a fever.[sighs]\\
330 - I'   ll bet it was that snot-nosed kid on the rock wall.\\
331 - Typhoid Tyler.Yeah.\\
332 - I got this.\\
333 - I worked for Charlie for ten years.\\
334 - I know vomit.\\
335 - Cleaning it up and inducing it.\\
336 - I never threw up SpaghettiOs before.\\
337 - It'   s kind of fun. Oh...\\
338 - [Berta laughs]\\
339 - Should we go to the doctor?\\
340 - Oh, no, no. I'   m sure it'   s just a tummy ache.\\
341 - I'   ll text the girls and let '   em know we can'   t make it.\\
342 - Oh, no. Come on. You go.\\
343 - You sure?\\
344 - Yeah, come on, this is what a parent does.\\
345 - This is what I signed up for.\\
346 - Besides, you took a half an hour\\
347 - getting into those Spanx.\\
348 - All right. Sorry.\\
349 - Um... I'   ll send pictures.\\
350 - Danielle said that if I get her drunk enough\\
351 - she'   ll show me her tattoos.\\
352 - Uh, she'   s got a bird on her hand and two in her...\\
353 -     Men.   \\
354 - Walden...\\
355 - I'   m sorry I got sick.\\
356 - What? Come on, man.\\
357 - Don'   t be sorry.\\
358 - It happens.\\
359 - I'   msorry you don'   t feel well.\\
360 - But you were going to go out with Alan\\
361 - and now you can'   t '   cause of me.\\
362 - Oh, I'   m not missing anything.\\
363 - You ever seen Alan dance?\\
364 - All right.\\
365 - Now, you get some good sleep\\
366 - and I'   m gonna be right here\\
367 - if you need anything.\\
368 - Oh, and you know who else'   ll be here?\\
369 - Your new friend, "Barfy the Bucket."\\
370 - [high-pitched voice]:     I'   m here for you    \\
371 -     If you'   re ready to spew!    \\
372 - [laughs]\\
373 -     Men.   \\
374 - [doorbell rings]\\
375 - Hey.\\
376 - Laurel.\\
377 - What are you doing here?\\
378 - I bailed.\\
379 - Didn'   t Alan tell you?\\
380 - No, the only thing I got\\
381 - was a picture of Alan twerking.\\
382 - With a caption that said, "Alan got his groove back."\\
383 - Well, when I heard that Louis was sick,\\
384 - I thought you could use some help.\\
385 - And soup.\\
386 - Come on, that is so sweet.\\
387 - You did not have to do this.\\
388 - You look amazing. Oh, thanks.\\
389 - Well, I already had the sitter, and...\\
390 - first rule of parenting: Never cancel the sitter.\\
391 - Well, unless she'   s banging your husband.\\
392 - Too far?\\
393 - No, uh, "too far"\\
394 - was starting a Facebook page\\
395 - called "Tiffany Jones is a Husband-Stealing Little Bitch."\\
396 - Uh, do you know what Louis has?\\
397 - Uh, well, I went on the Internet\\
398 - and I'   ve narrowed it down to either the flu,\\
399 - rickets or early-onset menopause.\\
400 - Second rule of parenting:\\
401 - Never consult the Internet.\\
402 - [chuckles]How'   s he doing now?\\
403 - Well, he'   s asleep\\
404 - and he'   s doing pretty well.\\
405 - Oh, good, because...\\
406 - I brought this for us.\\
407 - Oh...\\
408 - You know, third rule of parenting:\\
409 - Kids aren'   t the only ones that can drink from a bottle.\\
410 -     Men.   \\
411 -     Oh, yes, it'   s ladies'    night    \\
412 -     And the feeling'   s right    \\
413 -     Oh, yes, it'   s ladies'    night, oh, what a night    \\
414 - [deep voice]:     Oh, what a night.\\
415 - [whooping]\\
416 - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, there.\\
417 - I pour strong when the alcohol'   s free.\\
418 - I have to cram a lot of fun\\
419 - into a short amount of time.ALAN: Mmm.\\
420 - Kind of like sex with Roger.\\
421 - [women laughing]\\
422 - What is it with guys\\
423 - and their constant need for sex?\\
424 - Look at Alan here. He'   s out with two women,\\
425 - but I bet even he wants sex right now.\\
426 - I do. I really do.\\
427 - Oh, my God! Let'   s dance!\\
428 - [whoops]\\
429 - [both whooping]\\
430 -    \\
431 - Come up here, Alan!\\
432 - No, I-I'   m good down here.\\
433 - Well, he'   s still asleep\\
434 - and he feels cooler,\\
435 - but now I'   m worried that he might have hypothermia.\\
436 - Yeah.\\
437 - You know, one of the hardest lessons\\
438 - I'   ve had to learn as a parent is sometimes\\
439 - you just gotta relax.\\
440 - [laughing]: Relax?\\
441 - All I do is worry.\\
442 - And now that I don'   t sleep,\\
443 - I have plenty of time to do it.\\
444 - Is he exercising enough?\\
445 - Is he eating right? Does he even want to stay here?\\
446 - I mean, this is the most terrifying thing I'   ve ever done.\\
447 - And-- this is scarier than when I bought the big iPhone\\
448 - and I didn'   t know if it would fit in my pocket.\\
449 - [laughs]\\
450 - You think you'   re scared?\\
451 - I have a daughter.\\
452 - I worry about all the same things you do,\\
453 - plus penises.\\
454 - And with you,\\
455 - you have to worry about animated penises.\\
456 - I should have never told you that.\\
457 - You should never tell anyone that.\\
458 - All right, all right. What-what'   s your next date?\\
459 - Shrek?\\
460 - No, no, no. The-the genie from Aladdin.\\
461 - Or-or maybe you'   ll have a three-way\\
462 - with the Hakuna Matata guys?\\
463 - Shut up.\\
464 - Make me.\\
465 - I could make you.\\
466 - Oh, yeah?\\
467 - Mm-hmm.\\
468 - I'   m right here.\\
469 - I'   m so sorry. What? Why?\\
470 - You'   re married.\\
471 - To a man. Oh...\\
472 - That. Uh...\\
473 - I should go.\\
474 - No, no, no, no. No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
475 - Here'   s... okay, the thing about my marriage is...\\
476 - I'   m not gay.\\
477 - Does Alan know?\\
478 - His brain knows,\\
479 - but his heart may not.\\
480 - Here-here-here, here'   s the thing.\\
481 - Here'   s the thing: Alan is...\\
482 - he'   s my best friend, okay?\\
483 - And-and he married me as a favor\\
484 - so it would be easier to adopt Louis.\\
485 - Okay? And-and...\\
486 - Well, I mean... the fact that you\\
487 - married your best friend\\
488 - so that you could adopt Louis is..\\
489 - actually very sweet.\\
490 - So...\\
491 - ...you'   re not mad at me?\\
492 - Hakuna matata.\\
493 - That'   s my philosophy.\\
494 - So...\\
495 - ...can we kiss again? Yeah.\\
496 - It'   s been so long since I'   ve kissed a man. Oh...\\
497 - I wish I could say the same thing.\\
498 - Julie, your boobs look great in that blouse.\\
499 - I am so jealous.\\
500 - Thanks to my kids,\\
501 - mine went from 34B to 34 "used to be."\\
502 - I like your boobs.\\
503 - I don'   t know.\\
504 - What do you think, Alan,\\
505 - should I get '   em done?\\
506 - Oh, well, I'   m no expert.\\
507 - I-I think they'   re lovely.\\
508 - Are you sure?\\
509 - Oh, my!\\
510 - You just did that.\\
511 - Um, you guys, I-I think there'   s something I should tell you...\\
512 - He has nothing to compare them with.\\
513 - Here.\\
514 - You guys are my best friends.\\
515 - Aw! Aw!\\
516 - Okay, okay.\\
517 - I-I know you haven'   t done this in a while,\\
518 - so I don'   t want to go too fast,\\
519 - but do you want to go up to my...\\
520 - Let'   s go.\\
521 - Oh.\\
522 - LOUIS [over walkie-talkie]: Walden?\\
523 - Can you come here?\\
524 - He didn'   t say "over," so it doesn'   t count.\\
525 - Oh, go check on him. It'   s fine.\\
526 - I'   ve waited for two years, I can wait a little bit longer.\\
527 - Thank you.\\
528 - Oh. Don'   t start without me.\\
529 - Or do.\\
530 - Oh, uh, by the way, if you want to stay in the mood,\\
531 - we get all the cartoon channels.\\
532 -     Men.   \\
533 - Walden?\\
534 - Parenting rule number four:\\
535 - Sleep is better than sex.\\
536 -     Men.   \\
537 - This is the best night of my life.\\
538 - I love you girls.\\
539 - We should get matching tattoos.\\
540 - I have a better idea.\\
541 - Let'   s go to a strip club!\\
542 - That is better!\\
543 - [whooping]\\
544 -     Oh, yes, it'   s ladies'    night...    \\
545 - This was a great idea.\\
546 - That is definitely bigger than fun size.\\
547 - Make it rain!\\
548 - Yeah, give him some money!\\
549 - Oh, this just keeps getting better.

3 - Everybody has to see the gold and frankincense and myrrh\\

5 - It'   s 88 degrees out.\\
6 - I don'   t have any myrrh.\\
7 - Unless it'   s the biblical term for "swamp ass."\\
8 - We want this to be mantel-worthy.\\
9 - We want people to say, you know, "Look at those costumes,\\
10 - "look at that view, look at Cher'   s house\\
11 - perfectly positioned over Alan'   s right shoulder."\\
12 - Oh, it'   s got to be better than last year.\\
13 - Me as Joseph, Berta as the Virgin Mary\\

15 - People loved that.\\
16 - Okay, here we go.\\
17 - [camera beeps]\\
18 - Now everybody say...\\

20 - Sweet baby Jesus!\\
21 - Sorry about that.\\
22 - Oh, that'   s so cute.\\

26 - I don'   t get HBO.\\
27 - Guys, look at him.\\
28 - Isn'   t he the cutest in his little robe and beard?\\

42 - It looks real.\\
43 - Yeah. I love a white Christmas.\\
44 - So did Charlie.\\
45 - He used to put snow on every mirror in the house.\\
46 - Okay.\\
47 - Hey, hey, buddy, why don'   t you go inside\\
48 - and write your letter to Santa?\\
49 - Santa'   s not real.\\
50 - What?\\
51 - Of course he is.\\
52 - He'   s never brought me anything I asked for.\\
53 - Hey, I am sure\\
54 - that Santa'   s gonna come through for you this year, buddy.\\
55 - That'   s what grown-ups always say.\\
56 - Come inside with me.\\
57 - I made gingerbread Zippys.\\
58 - I was gonna make gingerbread houses,\\
59 - but everybody knows Zippys don'   t have houses.\\
60 - A six-year-old boy who doesn'   t believe in Santa.\\
61 - How sad is that?\\
62 - Almost as sad as my 20-year-old boy who does.\\
63 - This sucks.\\
64 - Just '   cause he grew up in a group home doesn'   t mean\\
65 - that he can'   t enjoy the magic of Christmas.\\
66 - I know. It was always Jake'   s favorite holiday.\\
67 - Especially the year he turned 13\\
68 - and got his first Christmas boner.\\
69 - It was the only toy he played with all day.\\
70 - Hey, you know, I bet Louis would believe\\
71 - if we got him exactly what he wanted.\\
72 - I don'   t know what he wants.\\
73 - ROSE: He wants a bike.\\
74 - God! Rose.\\
75 - What are you doing here?\\
76 - Wait. How do you know about Louis?\\
77 - Oh, Walden, you'   re so adorable.\\
78 - I just wanted to bring by my homemade Christmas candies.\\
79 - Do you like nuts?\\
80 - Covered in chocolate, yes.\\
81 - With a sweater and skirt, no.\\
82 - Oh. Okay.\\
83 - On this day, Walden'   s heart shrank three sizes.\\
84 - Anyway,\\
85 - I know this time of year can get busy,\\
86 - so if you need a helping hand, I'   m here.\\
87 - I can wrap presents or babysit or read a Christmas story.\\
88 - I'   m great at doing voices.\\
89 - Or hearing them.\\
90 - What do you want, Rose?\\
91 - My DNA, my fingerprints, a lock of my hair?\\
92 - No, silly.\\
93 - I have all that.\\
94 - I want to be your friend again.\\
95 - I don'   t think that I'   m comfortable\\
96 - with you being around Louis.\\
97 - Or me.\\
98 - If you want to hang out with Alan, that'   s fine.\\
99 - I'   ll pass.\\
100 -     Men.   \\
101 - Here you go-- a little Christmas cheer for everyone.\\
102 - Ugh! What is this?\\
103 - It'   s eggnog.\\
104 - With no rum!\\
105 - Eggnog without booze is as boring and bland\\
106 - as church without booze.\\
107 - Be a dear and go get some rum for your grandmother.\\
108 - Evelyn, he'   s six years old.\\
109 - Oh. Yes, right.\\
110 - The rum is in a bottle with a pirate on it.\\
111 - Maybe-maybe we can wait until Louis goes to bed.\\
112 - Of course.\\
113 - So run along to bed, dear.\\
114 - Mom.\\
115 - If you don'   t go to sleep, Santa won'   t come.\\
116 - There is no Santa.\\
117 - What?! Of course there is.\\
118 - Santa'   s as real as the nose on my face.\\
119 - [clears throat]\\
120 - Well, he'   s as real as my...\\
121 - Trust me, he'   s real.\\
122 - You know, she'   s right, and tonight we'   re gonna prove it,\\
123 - because we got a Santa cam,\\
124 - so we can catch the big man in red on video.\\
125 - Santa Claus!\\
126 - Old Saint Nick!\\
127 - [French accent]: Papa Noel.\\
128 - [Italian accent]: Babbo Natale.\\
129 - [German accent]: Weihnachtsmann.\\
130 - Which, of course, means "Christmas man" in German.\\
131 - Teachable moment.\\
132 - The-the point is, in the morning,\\
133 - when you see him on video,\\
134 - then you'   ll believe he'   s real, right?\\
135 - I guess.\\
136 - I guess?! What?\\
137 - It'   s a Christmas miracle!\\
138 - Did you hear that, Alan? Did you hear that, Evelyn?\\
139 - [imitating Jimmy Stewart]: You hear that, Clarence?\\
140 - Merry Christmas, you wonderful old building and loan!\\
141 - Okay, off to bed you go.\\
142 - And soon, you'   ll have visions of sugar plums\\
143 - dancing in your head.\\
144 - Can I have some pirate rum?\\
145 - No, we don'   t want visions\\
146 - of pink elephants dancing in our head.\\
147 - Okay, you go brush your teeth, and I'   ll be in in a minute.\\
148 - When Alan was little and couldn'   t sleep,\\
149 - I used to give him whiskey.\\
150 - Breast-feeding doesn'   t count, Mother.\\
151 - So here'   s the plan.\\
152 - Santa'   s not actually coming.\\
153 - You don'   t say.\\
154 - But how awesome is this?\\
155 - We got the number two guy from the Thanksgiving Day Parade.\\
156 - So, if the giant\\
157 - Bullwinkle balloon breaks loose and kills the number one Santa,\\
158 - this is the guy.\\
159 - ALAN: Yeah.\\
160 - He also appeared as Santa\\
161 - on an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger.\\
162 - He and Chuck Norris fought the bad guys with Christmas fu.\\
163 - So, when he gets here, he'   s gonna take the presents\\
164 - that we bought for him, and he'   s gonna put them under the tree,\\
165 - and then we'   ll get it on video,\\
166 - and then Louis will have the perfect Charlie Brown Christmas.\\

182 - Well, apparently, the presents\\
183 - have already been delivered in Colorado.\\
184 - [clears throat]\\
185 - Here. Come on in.\\
186 - I'   m Walden. This is Alan and, uh, Evelyn.\\
187 - Uh, wh-what do you go by? Mr. Claus?\\
188 - [chuckles]\\
189 - [Italian accent]: Babbo Natale?\\
190 - [German accent]: Weihnachtsmann?\\
191 - Actually, it'   s Frank.\\
192 - It'   s not very Christmasy.\\
193 - Well, if you don'   t like it,\\
194 - I can hang some mistletoe over my ass.\\
195 - That'   s my son you'   re talking to.\\
196 - Good one.\\
197 - I-I... I'   m sorry. We'   re-we'   re just really excited.\\
198 - It'   s our first Christmas with our foster son.\\
199 - Uh, basically, what we'   re gonna do is\\
200 - film you putting the presents under the tree.\\
201 - Uh, and then I'   ve written a little something\\
202 - for you to say to Louis.\\
203 - Let me guess.\\
204 - "Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, Louis!"\\
205 - Oh, that'   s better.\\
206 - Go with that.\\
207 - Okay, okay, okay, and then...\\
208 - then you'   ll take a bite of the cookie,\\
209 - you'   ll crunch the carrot, you'   ll sip the milk,\\
210 - wink at the camera, jiggle your belly and leave.\\
211 - So it'   s toys, bite, crunch,\\
212 - sip, wink, jiggle, leave.\\
213 - Toys, bite, crunch, sip, wink, jiggle, leave.\\
214 - Got it?\\
215 - So you want me to be Santa.\\
216 - Toys, bite, crunch, sip, wink, jiggle, leave.\\
217 - That sounds a lot like an orgy I had in Palm Springs once.\\
218 -     Men.   \\
219 - All right, let'   s get this stuff wrapped\\
220 - so we can enjoy this holiday the way I always imagined.\\
221 - Listening to Michael Bubl  '   s Christmas album...\\
222 - with my husband.\\
223 - Aw, looks like Alan'   s getting his first gift early.\\
224 - Where'   s the boy'   s bike?\\
225 - Oh, right here.\\
226 - That'   s not a boy'   s bike. That'   s a box.\\
227 - The boy'   s bike'   s in the box.\\
228 - Tell me the boy'   s bike in the box has been built.\\
229 - Oh, no, they wanted $75 to assemble it.\\
230 - That'   s like ten pairs of pants.\\
231 - I was paying for it!\\
232 - Oh, come on.\\
233 - How hard could it be?\\
234 -     Men.   \\
235 - Uh, sorry, looks like it'   s gonna be\\
236 - a little longer than we expected.\\
237 - Uh, any chance you know how to put together a bike?\\
238 - Right now, I'   m too buzzed to have a tool in my hand.\\
239 - I'   m just buzzed enough to have a tool in mine.\\
240 - Well, ho, ho, ho.\\
241 - Exactly.\\
242 - Here.\\
243 - Let me get us both a little more eggnog.\\
244 - Um, Santa, did you drive your own sleigh over here tonight?\\
245 - Nope. Santa Ubered.\\
246 - Oh, well, uh, hope your driver was named Rudolph.\\
247 - [laughs]\\
248 - Um, so what'   s going on?\\
249 - Does Santa know you'   re married?\\
250 - Does the IRS know you don'   t have five children?\\
251 - Marty and I have an open marriage.\\
252 - And since he'   s 93,\\
253 - my end opens a little more frequently than his.\\
254 - As does your mouth.\\
255 - That'   s one of the ends I was talking about.\\
256 - Here you go.\\
257 - You'   re running low on eggnog, so this one is all rum.\\
258 - [laughs] Thank you.\\
259 - You know, this is a situation\\
260 - where Santa doesn'   t need a little helper.\\
261 - So on, Prancer.\\
262 - Fine.\\
263 - But just know this:\\
264 - I am not afraid to give Santa a negative review on Yelp.\\
265 -     Men.   \\
266 - Okay, I can'   t make heads or tails of these instructions.\\
267 - They'   re barely in English.\\
268 - Uh, "The bolts of turning\\
269 - "shall revolve clockwords\\
270 - as in above figure below."\\
271 - Does it say anything about roommate of cheapness shall have\\
272 - foot inserted in back hole till tight?\\
273 - Oh.\\
274 - I guess on the first day of Christmas,\\
275 - my true love threatened me.\\
276 - I'   m sorry, but it'   s Louis'   s\\
277 - first Christmas not in the group home,\\
278 - and I want it to be perfect.\\
279 - No Christmas is ever perfect.\\
280 - There'   s always gonna be a toy\\
281 - that'   s broken or the wrong kind of batteries.\\
282 - I mean, even on the very first Christmas,\\
283 - Mary and Joseph woke up to the smell of donkey crap.\\
284 - I know. I just...\\
285 - I want him to believe in Santa,\\
286 - and-and get this bike\\
287 - and-and wake up to a winter wonderland.\\
288 - Not that I ordered a truckload of snow.\\
289 - I didn'   t get reindeer!\\
290 - Well, they'   re endangered.\\
291 - We could still make Christmas special for Louis.\\
292 - We just got to finish this bike. We can do this.\\
293 - You'   re right. We got an M.I.T. engineer and a...\\
294 - formerly board-certified chiropractor.\\
295 - Yeah, now we'   re talking.\\
296 - I mean, this can'   t be more difficult\\
297 - than realigning someone'   s spine.[scoffs]\\
298 - Here. [chuckles] You know, you got, uh...\\
299 - you got your, uh, your L2, uh, connected to your L3.\\
300 - [chuckles] And all we have to do is\\
301 - put the right pressure on the right spot and...\\
302 - Uh, and that is why I am\\
303 - a formerlyboard-certified chiropractor.\\
304 -     Men.   \\
305 - [bells jingling rhythmically]\\
306 - EVELYN [moaning]: Oh, Santa.\\
307 - [bells jingling faster]\\
308 - Oh, Santa!\\
309 - Oh, no.\\
310 - [bells jingling rapidly]\\
311 - SANTA: Here comes Santa Claus!\\
312 - Here comes Santa Claus!\\
313 -     Men.   \\
314 -     Men.   \\
315 - Oh, my God.\\
316 - What happened?\\
317 - I saw Mommy banging Santa Claus.\\
318 - What?It'   s 1972 all over again.\\
319 - We have a problem.\\
320 - Yes, you have a problem.\\
321 - You are the Christmas whore!\\
322 - Be that as it may, I think I killed Santa Claus.\\
323 - Oh, God!\\
324 - It'   s exactly like 1972!\\
325 -     Men.   \\
326 - Is he gonna be okay?\\
327 - Yeah, It was just atrial fibrillation.\\
328 - He just needs some medication and a few days rest.\\
329 - You hear that, sweetheart? I'   ll be fine by New Year'   s.\\
330 - I'   ll be counting down till the balls drop.\\
331 - Well, thank God Louis didn'   t see any of this.\\
332 - He would'   ve been traumatized.\\
333 - Louis? What about me?\\
334 - The man almost died while he was having sex with me.\\
335 - That'   s not easy to get over.\\
336 - No matter how many times it happens.\\
337 - Okay, well, all right, well, there you have it.\\
338 - Merry Christmas, Louis.\\
339 - Your grandmother banged Santa within an inch of his life.\\
340 - Here'   s half a bike!\\
341 - W-We can salvage this.\\
342 - There'   s still enough time to-to finish the bike,\\
343 - wrap the other gifts and get them under the tree.\\
344 - Okay, you'   re right.\\
345 - Louis will be asleep for six more hours.\\
346 - LOUIS: Walden?\\
347 - Oh, come on!\\
348 - I heard a noise. Did Santa come?\\
349 - Sadly, no.\\
350 -     Men.   \\
351 - All right.\\
352 - Where'   s Evelyn?\\
353 - Oh, well, uh...\\
354 - she went to her house to play with...\\
355 - her toys.\\
356 - All right, time for bed, bud.\\
357 - That'   s right. Santa'   s on his way.All right.\\
358 - If Santa is real,\\
359 - then how does he get in all the kids'    houses in one night?\\
360 - Well, he'   s got Christmas magic.\\
361 - And how does he know where everybody lives?\\
362 - Well... that'   s the magic of Google Maps.\\
363 - All right.\\
364 - Good night, buddy. Time to go to sleep.\\
365 - Can you guys stay with me till I fall asleep?\\
366 - Sure. Yeah.\\
367 - It'   s not like we need to help Santa assemble toys.\\
368 - He pays his elves $75 to do that.\\
369 - That'   s Timothy'   s spot.\\
370 - Oh, oh, okay.\\
371 - Um...\\
372 - I guess, uh...\\
373 - Good boy.\\
374 -     Men.   \\
375 - Alan?\\
376 - Mm-hmm?\\
377 - Oh, oh, my God!\\
378 - Oh, don'   t flatter yourself.\\
379 - I get one every morning.\\
380 - Where'   s Louis?\\
381 - Hmm?\\
382 - It'   s 7:00. We fell asleep.\\
383 - Oh, crap. Th-The bike.\\
384 - The presents. What are we gonna do?\\
385 - Well, is it too late to tell him we'   re Jewish?\\
386 - What the...\\
387 - Santa came! He is real!\\
388 - Did you...?\\
389 - No.\\
390 - He'   s on the video.\\
391 - You didn'   t see Grandma Evelyn wrestling with Santa, did you?\\
392 - No, just Santa.\\
393 - ALAN: That'   s...\\
394 - Santa.\\
395 - Oh, my God.\\
396 - If the Easy Bake Oven I have always wanted\\
397 - is under that tree, it is gonna blow my mind.\\
398 - Can I go outside and ride my bike?\\
399 - Sure.\\
400 - Alan, do you want to...?\\
401 - Oh, yeah. Absolutely.\\
402 - Uh, let'   s go, buddy. [chuckles]\\
403 - Looks like we had a great Christmas\\
404 - and saved $75.\\
405 - Rose?\\
406 - All right, come on, Rose, I know you'   re down there.\\
407 - Actually, I'   m behind you.\\
408 - Ah, son of a...!\\
409 - How do you do that?\\
410 - Whydo you do that?!\\
411 - Oh, a girl'   s got to have a little fun.\\
412 - Merry Christmas.\\
413 - I-I cannot believe that you went to all that trouble for us.\\
414 - You mean you can'   t believe Santa went to all that trouble.\\
415 - Okay, then I guess\\
416 - I need to say thank you to Santa.\\
417 - Well, he doesn'   t do it for the thanks,\\
418 - he does it because he genuinely wants\\
419 - to make the people in his life happy.\\
420 - Are you happy, Walden?\\
421 - I am.\\
422 - I-I couldn'   t have imagined a better Christmas morning.\\
423 - I mean, other than waking up with Alan poking me in the back.\\
424 - Listen, I...\\
425 - I'   m sorry that I said I didn'   t want you around.\\
426 - Oh, please.\\
427 - It'   s not like every time somebody says\\
428 - something mean to me, I write it down in a big book called\\
429 - "Those Who Have Wronged Me." [chuckles]\\
430 - That'   s funny.\\
431 - I think.\\
432 - Well, I told you before, I just want to be your friend.\\
433 - Well, you are.\\
434 - And...\\
435 - I'   m sorry if I forgot that.\\
436 - Oh.\\
437 - [chuckles]\\
438 - Oh, hey, but how did Santa\\
439 - manage to put that bike together?\\
440 - The instructions couldn'   t have been any clearer.\\
441 - "The bolts of turning shall revolve clockwords\\
442 - as in above figure below."\\
443 - [chuckles] Duh.\\
444 - Yeah. Duh.\\
445 - Do you guys have big plans for later?\\
446 - Uh, no, just the usual.\\
447 - Open gifts, call family,\\
448 - hope that you get their voice mail.\\
449 - Oh, the best part is Alan'   s gonna deep-fry a turkey,\\
450 - so there'   s a 50/50 chance he'   ll catch himself on fire.\\
451 - Oh, I got you guys\\
452 - a little something for the house.\\
453 - And I hope that every time you look at it,\\
454 - you'   ll think of me.\\
455 - [chuckles]\\
456 - Oh! A cuckoo clock.\\
457 - I get it. '   Cause you'   re...\\
458 - [whistles]\\
459 - [chuckles]\\
460 - What?\\
461 - No.\\
462 - Because it'   s red like a rose.\\
463 - How could you hurt me on Christmas?\\
464 - I'   m sorry. I-I...\\
465 - I thought it was...Oh, I'   m just kidding.\\
466 - No, it'   s totally '   cause I'   m cuckoo.\\
467 - Well, Merry Christmas, Walden.\\
468 - Merry Christmas, Rose.\\
469 - [clock chiming, cuckooing]\\
470 - [laughs]\\
471 - How cute is that? It'   s a tiny Rose.\\
472 - Wait, is that her real hair?\\
473 - ROSE: No, it'   s yours.\\
474 -     Men.   \\
475 -     You better watch out, you better not cry    \\
476 -     You better not pout... You know,\\
477 - this is what Christmas is all about.\\
478 - Family, Bubl  ,\\
479 - deep-fried turkey.\\
480 - Life is good, Alan.\\
481 - Hmm. It is.\\
482 - Um, can you cut mine for me?\\
483 - Deep-fried fingers.\\
484 - [clock chiming, cuckooing]\\
485 - That was sweet of Rose.Yeah.\\
486 - You know, I-I'   ve always been so cynical of her.\\
487 - Maybe she does just want to be friends, you know?\\
488 -     Now, he sees you when you'   re sleeping...

33 - to sleeping with you."\\
34 - Oh, oh, it'   s okay. I'   m-I'   m talking about my own son.\\
35 - You know, maybe I'   ll just avoid her.\\
36 - If I wanted to avoid every woman I ever embarrassed myself\\
37 - in front of, I'   d never leave the house.\\
38 - I'   d even have to steer clear of the UPS lady.\\
39 - She looked in the window and caught me...\\
40 - handling my own package.\\
41 - You know, it'   s not the things that you do,\\
42 - so much as the way that you say them.\\
43 - No, no.\\
44 - It-It'   s also the things that you do.\\
45 - Okay, you know, I just wish there was a way\\
46 - to, like, jump over the awkwardness\\
47 - and get right into the conversation with her.\\
48 - You know what, I think I can... I can help you with that.\\
49 - Laurel!\\
50 - Look who'   s here! And awake!\\
51 - Hey, guys.\\

57 - And I'   m-I'   m sorry\\
58 - I fell asleep instead of having sex with you. I...\\
59 - Will you stop walking by?\\
60 - I really am sorry.\\
61 - I'   m not mad.\\
62 - Though you are now in my phone as Rip Van Walden.\\
63 - I'   m sorry, what was that? I just nodded off.\\
64 - So, what you been up to?\\
65 - Oh, you know, not much. Just...\\
66 - training for a marathon,\\
67 - developing an international photo sharing app,\\
68 - and I'   m writing a young adult novel.\\
69 - Wow. Really?\\
70 - No, I have a six-year-old.\\
71 - All I do is come here and eat food on a stick.\\
72 - Well, do you want to... maybe...\\
73 - schedule another playdate?\\
74 - I would love that.\\
75 - I mean, Lily would love that.Oh.\\
76 - Louis would also love it.\\
77 - Imagine\\
78 - all the... games\\
79 - that they would play together.\\
80 - Yeah. And all the, uh, toys they would play with.\\
81 - Toys? I-I hope none of them are...\\
82 - a choking hazard.\\
83 - Wouldn'   t matter to me.\\
84 - I don'   t have a gag reflex.\\
85 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
86 -     Ah.     Men.     Men.\\
87 -     Men.   \\
88 - Morning. [groans]\\
89 - How'   s the neck?\\
90 - Not good.\\
91 - Yeah. Well, I told you not to stand under that mom\\
92 - on the rock wall.\\
93 - That'   s why we have rules!\\
94 - Yeah, well, wearing underwear on the rock wall\\
95 - should be one of those.\\
96 - Hey, Louis, are you excited about your playdate with Lily?\\
97 - I guess.\\
98 - "I guess."\\
99 - You got a cute girl coming over here.\\
100 - You should be popping in the...\\
101 - Kidz Bop Slow Jamz and putting some Sunny D on ice.\\
102 - Do I have to share my Legos with her?\\
103 - Of course not. It'   s a playdate. You'   re not marrying her.\\
104 - Alan.\\
105 - Yes, we should share everything we can--\\
106 - our toys, our books, our...\\
107 - sausage links.\\
108 - ALAN: If I could move\\
109 - my neck, I'   d give you such a look right now.\\
110 - The lesson is that we should all share.\\
111 - Okay. I got to poop.\\
112 - Whoa! Whoa, what are you doing?\\
113 - Sharing.\\
114 - No. No, that'   s taking!\\
115 - That'   s my job in this house!\\
116 -     Men.   \\
117 - So what'   s the deal?\\
118 - Pinched nerve? Slipped disk?\\
119 - The official diagnosis? You'   re old.\\
120 - Very funny. I'   d like a second opinion.\\
121 - All right, you'   re also out of shape.\\
122 - Come on, I'   m in decent shape for my age.\\
123 - Eh...\\
124 - Look, Alan, when you get to be our age,\\
125 - you get a little more fragile.\\
126 - You-you don'   t bounce back as easily.\\
127 - The only thing that bounces back is that belly\\
128 - when I poke it. [chuckles]\\
129 - Stop it.\\
130 - I used to be in the same boat as you.\\
131 - Then I found this awesome new gym,\\
132 - put myself on a regular workout program.\\
133 - Now I'   m in the best shape of my life.\\
134 - Surprised you didn'   t notice.\\
135 - Oh. Oh, yeah. You, uh... you look great.\\
136 - It'   s too late, Alan. The damage has been done.\\
137 - You should come down and work out with me.\\
138 - It'   s, uh, nothing but hot women in yoga pants\\
139 - as far as the eye can see.\\
140 - Sure, it'   s a little creepy if you look right at '   em,\\
141 - but, uh, there are mirrors everywhere.\\
142 - Yeah. I guess I could break out\\
143 - the old headband and leg warmers.\\
144 - Great. Hey, uh, since I got you here,\\
145 - it'   s, uh... it'   s been a year since your last prostate exam.\\
146 - Oh, no.\\
147 - If it makes you feel any better, you get a lollipop afterwards.\\
148 - Well, I'   ve done a lot more for a lot less.\\
149 -     Men.   \\
150 - Aw.Aw.\\
151 - It'   s like the eye of a hurricane.\\
152 - It'   s eerily quiet now, but in an hour\\
153 - everything will be broken and wet.\\
154 - Well, at least I'   m not the only one who falls asleep\\
155 - when cute girls are around.\\
156 - Aw. Thanks so much for having us.\\
157 - I'   m very impressed with this spread.\\
158 - What kind of cheese is this?\\
159 - Uh...\\
160 - okay, I have to confess.\\
161 - They'   re Lunchables.\\
162 - That'   s the yellow cheese,\\
163 - but I also have the orange and the white.\\
164 - No. No, thanks. I'   m gonna save room for the Fruit Roll-Up.\\
165 - So tell me,\\
166 - how is it that a guy like you is not already married\\
167 - to some-- I don'   t know-- gorgeous swimsuit model?\\
168 - Okay, you obviously haven'   t seen Alan in a Speedo.\\
169 - I'   m-I'   m serious.\\
170 - You'   re sweet, you'   re good-looking, you'   re successful.\\
171 - What the hell is wrong with you?\\
172 - Okay. I'   ve been told...\\
173 - that I listen too much.\\
174 - Which is a common problem\\
175 - among men whose penises are too large.\\
176 - [snorts]\\
177 - Uh, well, I-I also have this...\\
178 - this teeny, tiny quirk where, uh,\\
179 - I screw up relationships as soon as they start going well.\\
180 - Oh. That'   s encouraging.\\
181 - Oh, oh. No, no, no. But don'   t worry, uh,\\
182 - '   cause this isn'   t going well at all.\\
183 - Well, I'   m glad to hear you say that\\
184 - '   cause... I was about to leave.\\
185 - Oh.\\
186 - Mmm, okay. That-that kind of behavior\\
187 - can get you put in time-out.\\
188 - [chuckles] Time-outs don'   t work on me.\\
189 - I need to be spanked.\\
190 - [chuckles]\\
191 - Looks like someone needs to be sent to my room.\\
192 - Wow. Look at the Lululemons on her.\\
193 - Did I tell you or did I tell you?\\
194 - Yeah.Be cool, though.\\
195 - Getting tagged as a lurker is a hard label to shake.\\
196 - So I'   ve heard.\\
197 - Oh, oh, check out the redhead.\\
198 - Her shorts say "Juicy."\\
199 - If our garments are being honest,\\
200 - mine would say "Aroused." [chuckles]\\
201 - Ooh, look at the blonde on the yoga ball.Mmm,\\
202 - bouncy, bouncy, bouncy...\\
203 - Lyndsey?\\
204 - Alan.\\
205 - How did I not recognize her?\\
206 - I'   ve got to look at more faces.\\
207 - I didn'   t know you were a member here.\\
208 - Herb.\\
209 - I see they'   ve reinstated your membership.\\
210 - The appeals process was arduous,\\
211 - but, ultimately, justice was served.\\
212 - So, uh, how'   s everything?\\
213 - Good. I'   m sober again.\\
214 - I traded booze for exercise.\\
215 - You know, whenever I want a drink, I come here instead.\\
216 - Good thing this place is open 24 hours.\\
217 - Well, I'   m really happy for you. You look great.\\
218 - I also think you look great.\\
219 - In fact, as a medical professional,\\
220 - my opinion is "wowza."\\
221 - Thanks. Anyway, I got to go.\\
222 - It'   s time for my spin class.\\
223 - Oh, so, uh... so you went from a-a room\\
224 - that was spinning to a room for spinning.\\
225 - [chuckles]\\
226 - You know... glug, glug, glug, glug.\\
227 - [dizzy, retching sounds]\\
228 - [chuckles]\\
229 - Anyway, great seeing you.\\
230 - Yeah.\\
231 - I missed this.\\
232 - Wow, she looks amazing.\\
233 - Did you see how flat her stomach is?\\
234 - She'   s always had great abs. All that dry heaving\\
235 - gives you a hell of a six-pack.\\
236 - So, uh, you two are over?\\
237 - Oh, yeah. You know, it'   s complicated with me\\
238 - and Walden and Louis. Plus, you know, I don'   t know\\
239 - that Lyndsey and I were ever really good for each other.\\
240 - Kind of like me and lactose.\\
241 - That'   s too bad.Mmm.\\
242 - Mind if I take a crack at her?\\
243 - What?\\
244 - You two aren'   t together anymore.\\
245 - Maybe the cure for what ails her is a little Herb-al essence.\\
246 - Dude, you already married my ex-wife,\\
247 - you moved into my house, and earlier today\\
248 - you had your finger halfway to my liver.\\
249 - Maybe we share enough as it is.\\
250 - Okay, I get it. Bro code.\\
251 - Thank you.\\
252 - Just so you know, that exam was no picnic for me, either.\\
253 - [moaning softly]\\
254 - Did you hear that?\\
255 - I think it was the kids downstairs.\\
256 - What kids? [chuckles]\\
257 - Oh. [chuckles]\\
258 - You'   re right. It was probably nothing.\\
259 - [grunting]\\
260 - Oh, wait. What if one of them walks in on us?\\
261 - I had a hard enough time explaining\\
262 - where milk comes from.\\
263 - Do you want to lock the door?\\
264 - Yes.\\
265 - [chuckles]\\
266 - Mmm. Oh, no, no, no.\\
267 - What if there'   s an emergency?\\
268 - What if they need to come get us?\\
269 - What-what... what if there'   s a burglar or a fire,\\
270 - or a burglar who sets a fire as a distraction?\\
271 - Oh, no, no.\\
272 - [laughs]\\
273 - Not on my watch!\\
274 - Oh, my God, you'   re adorable.\\
275 - But if you can'   t stop worrying all the time,\\
276 - you'   re never gonna have sex again.\\
277 - Oh, my God.\\
278 - I'   m never gonna have sex again.\\
279 - You'   re used to single-people sex.\\
280 - That'   s a luxurious four-course meal at a fine restaurant.\\
281 - Parent sex is a drive-through.\\
282 - Get in, get out,\\
283 - hope you don'   t get anything on your shirt. Oh.\\
284 - Looks like your order just got supersized.\\
285 - [laughs]\\
286 - [moaning]\\
287 - LOUIS: Walden?\\
288 - Yes! Coming! Right there!\\
289 - Oh, God, are you okay?\\
290 - I'   m fine. Good news is, you finally got my bra off.\\
291 -     Men.   \\
292 -     Men.   \\
293 - Morning.\\
294 - Morning. Where'   s Louis?\\
295 - I sent him to take a bath.\\
296 - Oh, by the way, if you want syrup on your French toast,\\
297 - catch him before he hits the water.\\
298 - No. No French toast for me.\\
299 - I'   m hitting the gym a little later.\\
300 - Oh, uh, by the way, the beach is that way.\\
301 - Oh, look at that.\\
302 - Uh, my fitness band says that my pulse rate is 87.\\
303 - Tell me when it gets to zero.\\
304 - Yeah, joke all you want,\\
305 - but this little gizmo tracks all my physical activity.\\
306 - So far today, I have burned... 400 calories.\\
307 - Oh, wow. Did you go for a run?\\
308 - Nope, never left my bed.\\
309 - Oh, come on!\\
310 - So, how was your playdate with Laurel?\\
311 - Okay, let-let me... let me ask you guys something.\\
312 - When you had young kids, and they were still in the house,\\
313 - did you have a hard time, like... you know...\\
314 -     Bow chicka wow wow?\\
315 - Oh. Oh, well, Jake walked in on Judith and me countless times.\\
316 - Eventually, we stopped having sex altogether.\\
317 - Those aren'   t related.\\
318 - I just... I don'   t know what to do.\\
319 - It'   s like, Louis is stealing your sausage and blocking mine.\\
320 - Well, sooner or later, you just get over it.\\
321 - Uh, but in the meantime, why don'   t you take her out\\
322 - for a romantic night to a hotel?\\
323 - Oh. I like that.\\
324 - Plus, people do all kinds of things in hotels\\
325 - they don'   t do at home.\\
326 - Like pay eight dollars for peanuts.\\
327 - I used to love to have sex in hotel rooms.\\
328 - Then they caught me, and they fired me.\\
329 -     Men.   \\
330 - Do you want to work in?\\
331 - What?\\
332 - Oh, oh, uh, work in, yeah.\\
333 - Uh, definitely want to work in.\\
334 - Why else would I be sitting here?\\
335 - Thanks. [laughs] No problem.\\
336 - Just, uh, show you the proper technique.\\
337 - Mm.\\
338 - Here we go. [sighs]\\
339 - [laughs]\\
340 - [grunting]\\
341 - Aah!Oh, aah.\\
342 - Bum shoulder. Yeah.\\
343 - Got it the last Iron Man.\\
344 - The movie, not the triathlon.\\
345 - I slipped in the lobby on some artificial butter.\\
346 - Oh. There we go, lighten the load, and, uh...\\
347 - One time, here we go.\\
348 - [laughs]\\
349 - [groaning]\\
350 - [passes gas]\\
351 - Oh, God!\\
352 - Nice meeting you!\\
353 - Hey, Alan.\\
354 - Oh. Oh, hey, Lyndsey. Oh, hey.\\
355 - Yeah, I was just, uh...\\
356 - I was just doing the, uh, the fly machine.\\
357 - You know, working out.\\
358 - You'   re really committing to this workout thing.\\
359 - I'   m impressed.\\
360 - I know. I haven'   t been anyplace two days in a row\\
361 - since Jersey Boyswas touring.\\
362 - Where'   s Herb?Uh, in the office.\\
363 - He got all excited about an outbreak of pinkeye.\\
364 - When kids see pink, Herb sees green.\\
365 - Well, tell him I said "hi."\\
366 - Oh, I don'   t know\\
367 - if that'   s such a great idea.\\
368 - What do you mean?\\
369 - Well, get this.\\
370 - Uh, after we saw you the other day,\\
371 - he wanted to know if it was okay to ask you out.\\
372 - But don'   t worry. I told him no.\\
373 - What?\\
374 - You have no right to decide who I go out with.\\
375 - Oh, come on, Lyndsey. I mean, how would you feel\\
376 - if one of your friends wanted to go out with me?\\
377 - Shocked, stunned, like I need new friends.\\
378 - Look, I am just trying to help.\\
379 - You just got sober.\\
380 - I mean, before you move onto somebody else,\\
381 - you should probably get over your breakup\\
382 - with Captain Morgan.\\
383 - Are you freaking kidding me?!\\
384 - If I want to go out with Herb, it is none of your business.\\
385 - In fact, nothing I do is any of your business!\\
386 - Just stay the hell out of my life!\\
387 - Roid rage.\\
388 - [laughs]\\
389 - Phew.\\
390 -     Men.   \\
391 - [laughing]: Okay.\\
392 - This was officially a great idea.\\
393 - Did you like the way I checked us in?\\
394 - Mr. and Mrs. R. Doinit?\\
395 - Um, I like to go by my maiden name--\\
396 - Gettin'    Some.\\
397 - Hey, check this out.\\
398 - [laughs]\\
399 - I just walked across the floor without stepping on a Lego.\\
400 - [gasps]\\
401 - Look, there'   s chocolate on the pillows,\\
402 - and it'   s not even in the shape of a handprint.\\
403 - Oh. Get over here, woman. Uh-uh.\\
404 - No, no. I'   ve got a surprise for you.\\
405 - A surprise?\\
406 - Mm-hmm. Yay! What is it?\\
407 - Oh, I'   ll give you a hint.\\
408 - It'   s lacy, it'   s new, and you get to bite the tags off.\\
409 - If it'   s big enough to have tags on it,\\
410 - I already don'   t like it.\\
411 -     Men.   \\
412 - [doorbell ringing]\\
413 - Alan, what are you doing here?\\
414 - Well, I felt bad about earlier, and I wanted to apologize.\\
415 - These are for you.\\
416 - For me, huh?\\
417 - "Mr. Schmidt, thank you so much for your generous donation\\
418 - to the children'   s hospital."\\
419 - Um, I-I did not see that.\\
420 - HERB: Is that the pizza guy?\\
421 - Herb?\\
422 - Alan, what are you doing here?\\
423 - What are you doing here, and... and why are you wearing my robe?\\
424 - I'   ll let you guys talk.\\
425 - Alan, you showing up here is the second best thing\\
426 - that'   s happened to me today.\\
427 - What the hell, Herb?\\
428 - Believe me, I had no intention of going behind your back,\\
429 - but out of nowhere, Lyndsey invited me over for dinner,\\
430 - and I thought, "What'   s the harm?"\\
431 - Well, then, dinner turned into dessert,\\
432 - and dessert turned into, well, sex with Lyndsey.\\
433 - This hurts, Herb.\\
434 - Yesterday you were tickling my prostate,\\
435 - and today you'   re stabbing me in the back.\\
436 - Hey, it'   s your fault.\\
437 - You made me forbidden fruit.\\
438 - I was off-limits, like dancing in Footloose.\\
439 - Look, I'   m sorry it happened like this.\\
440 - And, well, if you want me to stop seeing her,\\
441 - just say the word, and it'   s over.\\
442 - LYNDSEY: Herb?\\
443 - Well, you had your chance.\\
444 - What do you think?\\
445 - It'   s horrible. Take it off.\\
446 - [laughs]\\
447 - Oh! Ooh!\\
448 - [phone chirps]\\
449 - No! [laughs]\\
450 - It'   s okay. Get it.\\
451 - [sighs]\\
452 - Okay, babysitter wants to know\\
453 - if Lily can have ice cream for dessert. [laughs]\\
454 - "Don'   t care. Getting laid."\\
455 - [mutters]\\
456 - No, I just wrote "Yes."\\
457 - [laughter]\\
458 - Oh, hey, you know, next time, we should just get one babysitter,\\
459 - and then Louis can sleep over with Lily at my house,\\
460 - and I can sleep over with you at your house.\\
461 - Yeah, maybe.\\
462 - Wait, wait, whoa, hold on.\\
463 - Do you not want there to be a next time?\\
464 - I mean, please reserve your judgment\\
465 - until after the first time.\\
466 - [laughs] I rarely\\
467 - disappoint a woman sexually before we have sex.\\
468 - No, it'   s just... all kids have their differences.\\
469 - But I don'   t want to talk about Louis and Lily right now.\\
470 - In fact, I don'   t want to talk at all.\\
471 - I got better things to do with my mouth.\\
472 - Wait a second. Wait a second. Hold on.\\
473 - Wait. Louis and Lily don'   t get along?\\
474 - Well, you know how kids are.\\
475 - One week, they like each other; the next, they don'   t.\\
476 - So Louis doesn'   t like to share.\\
477 - Lucky for you, I do.\\
478 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
479 - Louis does not have a problem sharing.\\
480 - In fact, I just talked to him specifically about sharing.\\
481 - I'   m sorry. Lily must have made it up.\\
482 - That'   s probably it. Okay.\\
483 - Wait a second.\\
484 - So you'   re okay with saying that Lily'   s a liar,\\
485 - but you can'   t admit that Louis has issues?\\
486 - [laughs] Oh. Okay, hold on.\\
487 - I think I would know if my son has issues.\\
488 - Right, '   cause you'   ve been a parent\\
489 - for all of, what, two weeks?\\
490 - Two and a half. [sighs]\\
491 - And fancy you lecturing me.\\
492 - The mother of Lily the biter.\\
493 - What? Lily'   s not a biter.\\
494 - All the other parents call her "Lily-goat."\\
495 - You know what? This was a bad idea.\\
496 - Oh, yeah, it was...\\
497 - [bleating]: baa-aa-aa-aa-aad.\\
498 - That was a sheep.\\
499 - And if this is how you talk to women in bed,\\
500 - then no wonder you had to marry Alan.\\
501 - [gasps] You will leave my husband out of this!\\
502 - You don'   t even know what you'   re missing.\\
503 - You were about to have the hottest sex of your life!\\
504 - Oh, oh, easy for you to say\\
505 - since you don'   t have to back it up.\\
506 - Oh, you want me to back it up?! '   Cause I'   ll back it up!\\
507 - Yeah, back it on up!\\
508 - Oh, what, are we gonna have sex?\\
509 - Shut up! Oh...\\
510 - [yelps, chuckles]\\
511 - Okay, I see where Lily gets her biting.\\
512 -     Men.   \\
513 - Boy, I was angrier than I thought.\\
514 - [exhales]\\
515 - Boy, I was angrier than I thought.\\
516 - [panting]\\
517 - Boy, I was angrier than I thought.
\subsection {Episode 10: Here I Come Pants}
1 - Previously on Two and a Half Men...\\
2 - Yeah, I see hundreds of potential parents,\\
3 - but you two are different somehow.\\
4 - I know we can be good parents.\\
5 - It is my job to be a hundred percent sure\\
6 - before I place a child.\\
7 - We are not believable as a loving couple,\\
8 - and I think that'   s why Ms. McMartin wasn'   t sure about us.\\
9 - All right, yeah.\\
10 - We do that in front of Ms. McMartin, we'   ll get ten babies.\\
11 -     Men.   \\

86 - I can explain.Oh, go ahead, I'   d love to hear it.\\
87 - She'   s my sister.\\
88 - Where was that five minutes ago?\\
89 - There'   s no explanation for what you did.\\
90 - I may have to remove Louis.\\
91 - Okay, I-I know this looks bad,\\
92 - but our hearts were in the right place.\\
93 - Yeah, even if our penises weren'   t.\\
94 - Th-The only thing that we'   re guilty of\\
95 - is putting on a little show.\\
96 - A littleshow?\\
97 - Every time I see this one, he acts like\\
98 - he'   s auditioning to host the Tonys.\\
99 - N-No, that'   s just Alan.\\

109 - but we are definitely a stable couple.\\
110 - Yeah, until the adoption is final,\\
111 - and then you'   ll, what, get divorced?\\
112 - Are you kidding me? If this one has his way,\\
113 - he'   s gonna be with me for the rest of my life.\\
114 - ALAN: Longer.\\
115 - I bought us side-by-side cemetery plots.\\
116 - No, he'   s not kidding.\\
117 - And he gave it to me for my birthday,\\
118 - and I pretended to like it,\\
119 - because that'   s what loving couples do.\\
120 - You pretended to like it?\\
121 - See that? See, that'   s real.\\
122 - And I'   m gonna hear about it for the rest of the night.\\
123 - Y-You want to take Louis away from us\\
124 - just because we don'   t have sex?\\
125 - I mean, I can honestly tell you\\
126 - that we have as much sex as I had\\
127 - in either of my previous marriages.\\
128 - None of that matters.\\
129 - N-No, of course it matters.\\
130 - Because we'   re not lying.\\
131 - We are best friends, and we are married.\\
132 - And we do love each other.\\
133 - And I'   m sorry, but just, you know, how many people can say\\
134 - that they are married to their best friend?\\
135 - Alan Harper-Schmidt can.\\
136 - My job is to do what'   s in the best interest of the child.\\
137 - Now I have to reevaluate what that is.\\
138 - But him living here...\\
139 - No, I don'   t want to hear anything else from you guys.\\
140 - I'   ll be in touch.\\
141 - I can'   t lose this kid.\\
142 - D-Don'   t go there. Nothing'   s been decided yet.\\
143 - Well, other than the fact\\
144 - that you don'   t want to be buried next to me.\\
145 - This is a disaster.\\
146 - We'   re gonna lose everything that we worked for\\
147 - over one stupid mistake.\\
148 - It'   s my chiropractic license all over again.\\
149 - Your hand slips into one butt crack.\\

165 - That'   s Timothy; he'   s Aquaman.\\
166 - Why can'   t I be Aquaman?\\
167 - Because Aquaman can keep himself afloat.\\
168 - I drew it '   cause we'   re a team now.\\
169 - That'   s right.\\
170 - [voice breaking]: We'   re a team that'   s never gonna break up.\\

172 - Can we go to the park?\\
173 - I don'   t see why not.\\
174 - Yes, we have to live in the moment.\\
175 - "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may."\\
176 - And you ask why you'   re Wonder Woman.\\
177 - Hey, why don'   t you go and get your shoes on,\\
178 - and we'   ll get going, okay?\\
179 - Cool!\\
180 - You'   re the best dad ever.\\
181 - Oh, my God.\\
182 - Did you hear that?\\
183 - He used the "D" word.\\
184 - I more than heard it, I felt it.\\
185 - But I am not gonna cry.\\
186 - That'   s right.\\
187 - We got to stay strong in front of the kid.\\
188 - We can'   t let him know something'   s going on.\\
189 - [voice breaking]: '   Cause that'   s what a... a good dad does.\\
190 - I'   m gonna go get my jacket.\\
191 - I feel so bad for him.\\
192 - Well, what are you gonna do about it?\\
193 - There'   s nothing I can do.\\
194 - Just gonna throw in the towel before the first round?\\
195 - What?\\
196 - Let me put it in terms you'   ll understand.\\
197 - You'   re crapping your tutu before the ballet starts.\\
198 - After all that Walden'   s done for you,\\
199 - you have to help him keep ahold of Louis.\\
200 - How?I don'   t know.\\
201 - But if there is anybody in the world that can figure out\\
202 - how to keep somebody in this house, it'   s you.\\
203 -     Men.   \\
204 - Um, is this seat taken?\\
205 - Uh, actually, no, it'   s...\\
206 - What are you doing here?\\
207 - Did you follow me?\\
208 - No.\\
209 - But I knew you were here because of the picture\\
210 - you posted of your bruschetta.\\
211 - This is completely inappropriate.\\
212 - And only jackasses say "brew-sketta."\\
213 - Just-just hear me out, I need to talk to you about Louis.\\
214 - The time to talk to me about Louis was\\
215 - before you lied to me to get him.\\
216 - I only need five minutes.\\
217 - I-I'   ll even pay for your dinner.\\
218 - I mean, if you really knew me,\\
219 - you'   d know what a big deal that is.\\
220 - Fine, five minutes.\\
221 - Thank you.\\
222 - Oh, and if you want anything else, order fast--\\
223 - the happy hour prices are about to go away.\\
224 - What do you have to say?\\
225 - [sighs] Look...\\
226 - Walden is really a great guy.\\
227 - All he wanted was to be a dad,\\
228 - and he tried everything he could think of.\\
229 - I mean, he only married me because I was his last resort.\\
230 - I'   m like peeing in a Gatorade bottle\\
231 - when you'   re stuck in traffic.\\
232 - Nobody wants to do it, but sometimes it'   s your only option.\\
233 - You know what a last resort looks like?\\
234 - Like a 33-year-old woman who devoted herself to her career\\
235 - because she had nothing else and then realized\\
236 - she'   s not even good at that because she screwed up\\
237 - and gave a kid to two guys pretending to be a gay couple.\\
238 - I was just named employee of the month.\\
239 - Now I can'   t even use my $25 Target gift card\\
240 - without feeling guilty.\\
241 - You are a good employee and a good person.\\
242 - And, if it'   ll help, I'   ll, uh, I'   ll buy the gift card off you.\\
243 - Uh, what'   s fair?\\
244 - Ten? 15? Ten?\\
245 - You know, the worst part of this is\\
246 - I actually liked you guys.\\
247 - I put your Christmas card on my fridge.\\
248 - Now I don'   t even know who you are.\\
249 - Who are those people on my fridge?!\\
250 - We'   re the same two people that you trusted Louis with\\
251 - in the first place.\\
252 - This whole thing is a nightmare.\\
253 - Do you realize I could lose my job?\\
254 - I have five cats to support.\\
255 - I know, and I-I feel terrible\\
256 - that we put you in this position.\\
257 - Our only intent was to give a child in need a good home.\\
258 - Well, I suppose I can'   t fault you for that.\\
259 - Great.\\
260 - So...\\
261 - we'   re done here, we get to keep Louis,\\
262 - and I'   ll give you eight bucks for the gift card.\\
263 - I wish it was that simple.\\
264 - I just don'   t know what the right thing to do is.\\
265 - Okay, well, y-you don'   t have to decide right now.\\
266 - Let'   s, uh, let'   s talk about it.\\
267 - Um, uh, can I get an appletini, uh, sugar rim, extra zest?\\
268 - You don'   t have to pretend to be gay anymore.\\
269 - Oh-oh, yeah, uh, right, uh, uh...\\
270 - Uh, make it a mojito.\\
271 - [whispers]: Skinny.\\
272 - So, uh, what do you say, Ms. McMartin?\\
273 - Uh, another Chardonnay?\\
274 - Eh, what the hell?\\
275 - It'   s not like this week could get any worse.\\
276 - I can'   t believe I'   m doing this.\\
277 - I can'   t believe you'   re doing this either.\\
278 - Oh, oh, Alan.\\
279 - Oh, Ms. McMartin.\\
280 -     Men.   \\
281 -     Men.   \\
282 - This is a disaster.\\
283 - I'   m sorry.\\
284 - Come on, man.\\
285 - You like her. Rise and shine.\\
286 - What is wrong with me?\\
287 - Oh, no, no, it'   s not you.\\
288 - Uh, although, if I, uh, if I did have one note, uh,\\
289 - the beige granny panties didn'   t exactly move the needle.\\
290 - They'   re nude-colored, and they are my work panties.\\
291 - Although your use of the word "needle"\\
292 - is anatomically accurate.\\
293 - I am a grower, not a shower.\\
294 - Why do I always make such a mess of things?\\
295 - [crying]: I'   m sorry.\\
296 - Don'   t be.\\
297 - The crying'   s actually helping.\\
298 - What?\\
299 - Um, your weeping reminds me\\
300 - of having sex with my first wife.\\
301 - How did I get here?\\
302 - I went to Stanford.\\
303 - I turned down a job on Wall Street to help save the world,\\
304 - and now I'   m in bed with an old guy\\
305 - who can'   t get a boner!\\
306 - [sobbing]\\
307 - Um, actually, that is no longer the case.\\
308 - Seatbacks and tray tables\\
309 - are in their full upright position.\\
310 - Flight attendants, prepare for takeoff.\\
311 - Get out.\\
312 - Oh. Oh, okay.\\
313 - Um...\\
314 - I, uh...\\
315 - I, uh, hope this won'   t affect your decision about Louis.\\
316 - I would hate it if you held my flaccid penis\\
317 - against Walden.\\
318 -     Men.   \\
319 - Oh, hey.\\
320 - Um, you'   re... you'   re still up.\\
321 - It'   s 8:15.\\
322 - Oh, to be young again.\\
323 - So, uh, what have you been doing?\\
324 - Oh, I-I was, uh, making a video montage\\
325 - of the time we spent with Louis. You want to see it?\\
326 - Yeah. Yeah, great.\\
327 -     Ooh, child, things are gonna get eas...    \\
328 - [music stops]\\
329 - That'   s it?\\
330 - Yeah, we really should have taken more pictures.\\
331 - Where have you been?\\
332 - Oh, I, uh... I, uh...\\
333 - I went to, uh, see Ms. McMartin.\\
334 - Are you kidding me?\\
335 - She told us to leave her alone.\\
336 - Alan, when people say that to you, they mean it.\\
337 - Remember how you'   re not allowed to go to Subway anymore\\
338 - and suggestively ask for "double meat"?\\
339 - I-I was just trying to help us keep Louis.\\
340 - Okay, tell me exactly what you did\\
341 - so I can start to undo it.\\
342 - O-Okay. Um, I followed her to a bar...\\
343 - Oh, God!\\
344 - This is like the time that we saw Kelly Ripa\\
345 - outside the grocery store!\\
346 - No. No, no, no.\\
347 - So we-we had a few drinks,\\
348 - uh, and the funny part is, um, we ended up in bed.\\
349 - You had sex with Ms. McMartin?!\\
350 - No!\\
351 - No, I did not.\\
352 - I was unable to maintain an erection.\\
353 - This has gone from bad to worse. I might start crying.\\
354 - I wouldn'   t.\\
355 -     Men.   \\
356 - How you doing?\\
357 - I'   ve been better.\\
358 - Well, you want to forget the pain\\
359 - or you want to forget your name?\\
360 - Got anything to help me forget Alan?\\
361 - If I did, I'   d be asking you, "Who'   s Alan?"\\
362 - Listen, don'   t let yourself get too down.\\
363 - It'   s like I tell my daughters,\\
364 - no use crying until the verdict'   s read.\\
365 - I tried to sway Ms. McMartin.\\
366 - She won'   t even take my calls.\\
367 - Well, someone ought to tell her\\
368 - that you are the best thing that ever happened for that kid.\\
369 - I'   m just worried about\\
370 - what will happen to him if she doesn'   t let me keep him.\\
371 - Being a foster kid makes you tough.\\
372 - Before he goes, I'   ll teach him\\
373 - how to make a shiv out of a Krazy Straw.\\
374 - Thanks.\\
375 - I needed a laugh.\\
376 - Yeah, '   cause I'   m kidding.\\
377 - I don'   t want him to leave either.\\
378 - He'   s a good kid, isn'   t he?\\
379 - Yeah.\\
380 - If I lose him, all I'   m gonna have\\
381 - is a five-second photo montage\\
382 - and a picture of Alan as Wonder Woman.\\
383 - Look, we'   re all in this together.\\
384 - Anything I can do for you, you let me know.\\
385 - Thanks. I appreciate it.\\
386 - You know, if you happen to know a guy who specializes\\
387 - in making a father and son disappear,\\
388 - you just might want to keep that number handy.\\
389 - I do know a guy\\
390 - that could sneak 80 pounds into the country.\\
391 - I don'   t see why he couldn'   t sneak 80 pounds out.\\
392 -     Men.   \\
393 - Ms. McMartin is 15 minutes late.\\
394 - You know, we might be a fraudulently gay couple,\\
395 - but at least we'   re punctual.\\
396 - We'   re not the only ones who lied.\\
397 - I know for a fact that blonde is not her natural hair color.\\
398 - [doorbell rings]\\
399 - That'   s her.\\
400 - Yeah, and she better watch it,\\
401 - '   cause I am in mama grizzly mode.\\
402 - Promise me you won'   t make this\\
403 - more awkward than it already is.\\
404 - You got it, of course.\\
405 - Ms. McMartin.\\
406 - Hello, Walden.\\
407 - Alan.\\
408 - '   Sup, girl?\\
409 - Who'   s here?\\
410 - Oh, hey, buddy.\\
411 - Uh, it'   s Ms. McMartin.\\
412 - Hi, Louis.\\
413 - Hi.\\
414 - Hey, why don'   t you go in your room and play, uh,\\
415 - while the grown-ups talk for a little.\\
416 - Sure. Okay.\\
417 - You see how he handled that?\\
418 - "Let the grown-ups talk."\\
419 - Supportive and gentle,\\
420 - not unlike your delightful beige work panties.\\
421 - Alan, let the grown-ups talk.\\
422 - I'   ve thought about this a long time,\\
423 - and nobody wanted this to work out more than I did.\\
424 - [sighs]\\
425 - Please don'   t do this.\\
426 - I have to do my job,\\
427 - and the fact of the matter is you lied.\\
428 - You committed fraud.\\
429 - But we are legally married.\\
430 - He is my best friend.\\
431 - We'   re-we'   re good parents.\\
432 - And-and clearly, we love each other.\\
433 - WALDEN: Yes.\\
434 - The-the only thing that we don'   t do\\
435 - is, well, "love" each other.\\
436 - But if that'   s the only reason that we don'   t get to keep Louis,\\
437 - i-is because I don'   t put my man parts\\
438 - into Alan'   s... mostly man parts...\\
439 - ...then we will have sex right here in front of you.\\
440 - I mean... come on, Alan.\\
441 - Oh, okay.\\
442 - Um...\\
443 - Guys, stop.\\
444 - No, I am serious!\\
445 - I will have sex with Alan right here\\
446 - on the living room floor if we get to keep this kid!\\
447 - Now, how can you say\\
448 - that this isn'   t a great home for a child?\\
449 - I know you'   re upset.\\
450 - I am, too.\\
451 - But I'   ve made up my mind.\\
452 - No!\\
453 - This can'   t be it!\\
454 - LOUIS: I'   m ready.\\
455 - What are you doing, buddy?\\
456 - Whenever Ms. McMartin comes\\
457 - and the grown-ups start yelling, I get taken away.\\
458 - Oh, man.\\
459 - I'   m very sorry, Louis.\\
460 - What'   s going on?\\
461 - She'   s taking him.\\
462 - BERTA: What?\\
463 - Hey, blondie, how many people know you'   re here?\\
464 - Berta, it'   s okay.\\
465 - And she'   s not a real blonde.\\
466 - Come here.\\
467 - I want you to know that this isn'   t your fault.\\
468 - You didn'   t do anything wrong and you'   re a great kid.\\
469 - I really liked it here.\\
470 - We are, uh... we'   re gonna miss you, kiddo.\\
471 - Me, too.\\
472 - Here.\\
473 - No.\\
474 - T-Timothy'   s your best friend.\\
475 - He'   ll be your best friend now.\\
476 - [sobs]\\
477 - Bye, Louis.\\
478 - Bye. Bye, Berta.\\
479 - So long, kid.\\
480 - Come on, Louis.\\
481 - I can'   t do this.\\
482 - What?\\
483 - No, the whole reason I took this job\\
484 - was to help kids.\\
485 - No matter how we got here,\\
486 - this is the best place for him.\\
487 - Oh, this is amazing.\\
488 - Come here, buddy. Oh!\\
489 - Did you grow while you were gone?\\
490 - [laughs] No.\\
491 - No?\\
492 - Get ready for a mama bear hug.\\
493 - Mama bear.[laughs]\\
494 - Oh, my goodness, thank you.\\
495 - No more lies.\\
496 - No.\\
497 - Unless my boss finds out about this.\\
498 - Then I totally need you to lie.\\
499 - Glad to have you back, kid.\\
500 - Oh, and, Ms. McMartin,\\
501 - you might want to stay away from your house\\
502 - until I can make some phone calls.\\
503 - Okay! Okay!\\
504 - Let'   s put your stuff away, buddy.\\
505 - Hey, you know what?\\
506 - You can have this now,\\
507 - '   cause I got my best friend back.\\
508 - Technically, I'   m your best friend.\\
509 - [laughs]\\
510 - And I never left.\\
511 - Still, a touching moment.\\
512 - That was really sweet of you.\\
513 - I feel good about it.\\
514 - Today you earned your Target gift card.\\
515 - [laughs]\\
516 - Thanks.\\
517 - No, thank you.\\
518 - [sniffles]\\
519 - Oh. Oh, are you... are you crying?\\
520 - Yes, but... tears of joy.\\
521 - Those work, too.\\
522 -     Men.   \\
523 -     Men.    Wow!\\
524 - That was amazing!\\
525 - Yep.\\
526 - Alan may disappoint sometimes,\\
527 - but a little blue pill never does.\\
528 - Hey, could I ask you a personal question?\\
529 - What do you consider personal?\\
530 - I already let you try on my work panties.\\
531 - Well... how do I put this?\\
532 - Ms. McMartin, what'   s your first name?\\
533 -     Men.   
\subsection {Episode 11: For Whom the Booty Calls}
1 -     Men.   \\
2 - [sighs]\\
3 - I can'   t believe it. I know.\\
4 - Since you let me do it to you, I had to let you do it to me.\\
5 - Not that.\\
6 - Although, remind me to throw away that cat toy.\\
7 - No, I meant the fact that you are cheating\\
8 - on your husband to sleep with your social worker.\\
9 - You just described a fantasy I didn'   t know I had.\\
10 - Naughty social worker.\\
11 - Show me on the doll where I should touch you.\\
12 - Okay, I need to keep romantically what I do here\\
13 - separate from what I do professionally out there.\\
14 - Even though, in both cases,\\
15 - I seem to work with the jobless and homeless.\\
16 - I think we have a professional relationship.\\
17 - You gave us a kid, I gave you an orgasm.\\
18 - Well, technically, both of those are still pending.\\
19 - But I'   m serious.\\
20 - If we'   re gonna do this, we have to establish some boundaries.\\
21 - I mean, I'   m overseeing Walden'   s adoption of Louis.\\
22 - Right, right, I-I really don'   t want to mess that up.\\
23 - It'   s just that I-I like spending time with you.\\
24 - And I--\\
25 - to my surprise--\\
26 - like spending time with you.\\
27 - I'   m kind of like poison ivy.\\
28 - You don'   t realize you'   ve been exposed until you get that itch.\\
29 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
30 -     Ah.     Men.     Men.\\
31 -     Men.   \\
32 - Hey.\\
33 - Oh, what'   s that?\\
34 - Yes, I am wearing the same clothes as last night.\\
35 - Ask not for whom the booty calls.\\
36 - The booty calls for me.\\
37 - So I assume you'   re not gonna stop\\
38 - until I ask who it was.\\
39 - A gentleman doesn'   t kiss and tell,\\
40 - but I'   m no gentleman,\\
41 - and it'   s hard to kiss a woman from behind.\\
42 - Alan, okay, who was it?\\
43 - [laughing]: I banged our social worker.\\
44 - Ms. McMartin?\\
45 - Again?\\
46 - What can I say?\\
47 - She gave my penis a good home.\\
48 - I thought this was gonna be something that you did once,\\
49 - like manscaping with a straight razor.\\
50 - Please don'   t mess this up for me.\\
51 - Oh, no, no, it'   s a good thing.\\
52 - Uh, plus, we-we really like each other,\\
53 - And we agreed to respect boundaries.\\
54 - You know-- personal life, professional life.\\
55 - Okay, and what boundaries are you respecting\\
56 - when you'   re bragging about having sex with her?\\
57 - That'   s just something a man wants to share with his husband.\\
58 - [doorbell rings]\\
59 - Oh, oh, that'   s Ms. McMartin.\\
60 - She'   s here to check up on Louis.\\
61 - It was supposed to be a surprise.\\
62 - [stammering]: Wait up, hold on...\\
63 - She told you this?\\
64 - No, she didn'   t tell me-- we have boundaries.\\
65 - I saw it on her phone when I was going through her texts.\\
66 - Hello, Walden.\\
67 - Ms. McMartin.\\
68 - Hi.\\
69 - What a surprise.\\
70 - Come on in.\\
71 - Hey, girl.\\
72 - You are social workin'    it.\\
73 - Can I get you anything?\\
74 - Like a new boyfriend?\\
75 - Okay, so obviously Alan told you about us.\\
76 - Uh, yes, he has.\\
77 - Look, I want you to know\\
78 - this will in no way affect our professional relationship.\\
79 - I am here strictly as your and Louis'   s caseworker.\\
80 - And let me tell you something right now,\\
81 - I want to back that case up.\\
82 - You know, Alan, the lucky thing is that after I smack you,\\
83 - there'   s already a social worker here to report it to.\\
84 - So how is everything going with Louis?\\
85 - You know, it'   s good.\\
86 - Uh, but I have a couple questions.\\
87 - Like... like, okay, for example,\\
88 - what'   s the best way to discipline him?\\
89 - Uh, I believe she favors spanking.\\
90 - All right, what do I say\\
91 - when he asks about his biological parents?\\
92 - And how much cheese is too much cheese?\\
93 - Okay, how about we just do one question at a time?\\
94 - Okay, okay.\\
95 - There'   s some cultural things, like--\\
96 - should I teach him a cool handshake,\\
97 - or does that just make me lame?\\
98 - Good question, bro.\\
99 - Blow it up.\\
100 - You know what might help?\\
101 - Talking to other foster parents.\\
102 - Actually, some of my dads have started\\
103 - an informal support group.\\
104 - They kick around these kind of questions every week.\\
105 - Oh, that'   d be great for you.\\
106 - Uh, I went to a group for divorced dads,\\
107 - and it really helped.\\
108 - Uh, I also went to a group for people whose moms died,\\
109 - but, uh, that was just wishful thinking.\\
110 -     Men.   \\
111 - Hey, buddy. Berta'   s gonna watch you\\
112 - when I go to my meeting tonight, okay?\\
113 - Okay.\\
114 - We'   re gonna have a lot of fun.\\
115 - Remember the last time when we learned about animals and math?\\
116 - Yep. Wow, what'   d you learn?\\
117 - A trifecta is a sucker bet.\\
118 - And?\\
119 - Horses run faster when they poop before the race.\\
120 - The kid'   s a sponge.\\
121 - Good morning.\\
122 - Speaking of sponges.\\
123 - Morning.\\
124 - Big plans for the day?\\
125 - I got my first dads group tonight.\\
126 - Oh. And before that, Louis and I are gonna go to the movies.\\
127 - Then I'   m gonna hit the gym.\\
128 - Oh, you know what?\\
129 - Why don'   t we go to the gym first?\\
130 - That way, we can steal some waters\\
131 - so we can sneak them into the movies.\\
132 - You want to go?\\
133 - Uh, isn'   t today when you go to the farmer'   s market\\
134 - and bargain for bruised peaches?\\
135 - I can just go to the supermarket.\\
136 - They'   re all bruised when you bring a Sharpie.\\
137 - I want to spend the day with you.\\
138 - Oh, great.\\
139 - You know, it'   s just that I-I was gonna head straight from the gym\\
140 - to the meeting.\\
141 - So...\\
142 - if you go...\\
143 - Oh, oh, I get it. Say no more.\\
144 - Thank you.\\
145 - You can just drop me off on your way.\\
146 - Mmm, what do you want for dinner?\\
147 - I don'   t know.\\

198 - I got three grown kids from my first marriage,\\
199 - and Heidi and I just adopted a seven-year-old girl.\\
200 - Wow. You must really love kids.\\
201 - Kids are fine. What I love is Heidi.\\
202 - You saw her.\\
203 - When I was in college,\\
204 - her mother was in sixth grade.\\
205 - And if you think about it,\\
206 - my next wife isn'   t even born yet.\\
207 - So, uh, why did you and your wife choose to adopt?\\
208 - My wife is incapable of having children.\\
209 - Oh. Oh. Oh.\\
210 - Yeah, his name is Alan.\\
211 - Oh. Oh. Oh.\\
212 - A-Although, uh,\\
213 - he did order boner pills from China once\\
214 - that made him lactate.\\
215 - [chuckles]\\
216 - [chuckles] Uh,\\
217 - so, anything going on with Louis?\\
218 - Yeah, you know, I have a couple questions\\
219 - that-that you'   re the perfect person to answer.\\
220 - Why is that?\\
221 - '   Cause I'   m handsome? Charming?\\
222 - College graduate? Top home security specialist\\
223 - in the South Bay three years running?\\
224 - Yes, that...\\
225 - Louis is also all those things.\\
226 - I'   m just messing with you!\\
227 - [chuckles]Yeah.\\
228 - Ms. McMartin told us your kid was mixed-race.\\
229 - So what do you want to know?\\
230 - Uh, do you want to know how to comb his hair?\\
231 - Uh, what type of music to expose him to?\\
232 - Do I need to teach him a cool handshake?\\
233 - So that'   s-that'   s actually a thing?\\
234 - Yeah, yeah. Here, let me show you, let me show you.Oh.\\
235 - Huh? Huh? Ooh.\\
236 - That is cool.\\
237 - And you just did it\\
238 - to hand me your business card.\\
239 - Yeah. If you tell me that I sent you,\\
240 - then you get 20% off.\\
241 - By the way, have you seen my wife?\\
242 -     Men.   \\
243 - Hey, uh, thanks for having me.\\
244 - You know, this is great. I-I don'   t think I knew it,\\
245 - but I needed a place like this.\\
246 - You mean a place to get away from our wives?\\
247 - Preach!\\
248 - Wait, why do you need a place? You'   re married to a guy.\\
249 - Your only problem is, do I watch SportsCenterbefore,\\
250 - during or after sex?\\
251 - Uh, actually, it'   s-it'   s a little more complicated than that.\\
252 - What do you mean?\\
253 - I mean, well, imagine...\\
254 - all of the wife and none of the sex.\\
255 - Yeah, we don'   t need to imagine. We'   re married, too.\\
256 - I don'   t know what you guys are talking about.\\
257 - I get all the sex I can handle.\\
258 - Which, at my age, is about once a month.\\
259 - Can-can I share something that doesn'   t leave this room?\\
260 - Yeah, sure. Oh, these guys know that back when I was single...\\
261 - [whispers]: I used to bang his sister.\\
262 - Okay, here'   s the thing.\\
263 - I'   m not gay.\\
264 - I-I married my best friend\\
265 - so I could adopt Louis.\\
266 - Really?\\
267 - Then you shouldn'   t have any of these problems.\\
268 - And yet I have all of these problems.\\
269 - I mean, that'   s why it'   s so great coming here.\\
270 - I get to get away from Alan.\\
271 - I mean, he wants to do everything with me.\\
272 - He ordered a Groupon for two-for-one prostate exams.\\
273 - Are your wives that clingy?\\
274 - Oh, yeah. My wife just bought golf clubs\\
275 - so she could ruin golf for me.\\
276 - My wife'   s outside waiting in the minivan.\\
277 - Yeah, even I have to get away from Heidi every now and then.\\
278 - Do you know what the worst "wife" thing is?\\
279 - When you forget to ask them, "How was your day?"\\
280 - Oh.No, no,\\
281 - the worst thing is when you ask Alan,\\
282 - "How was your day?" and he answers.\\
283 - You know, it'   s funny-- I-I always thought\\
284 - being married to a guy would be different.\\
285 - In some ways, it is. I mean, uh... for example,\\
286 - I imagine that you guys enjoy it\\
287 - when you walk in on your wives masturbating.\\
288 - Oh, yeah.Yeah, yeah...\\
289 - Oh, no!\\
290 -     Men.   \\
291 - Hey, there you are. We didn'   t get to talk yesterday.\\
292 - How was your day?\\
293 - Great. How was your...\\
294 - day?\\
295 - Oh, oh, it was the worst.\\
296 - Fade in: Supermarket. There were only two lanes open,\\
297 - but there must have been 30 of us.\\
298 - 30? Wow, that'   s an amazing end to that story.\\
299 - I wish. You know they don'   t give you bags anymore?\\
300 - If you want a bag, that'   s ten cents.\\
301 - Ten cents. That'   s outrageous.\\
302 - That'   s six bruised peaches.\\
303 - Uh, anyway, so I-I went out to the parking lot\\
304 - and there was a...Alan, can...\\
305 - can we just jump to the end?\\
306 - She agreed not to press charges.\\
307 - Okay, that is the end to, like, way too many of your stories.\\
308 - So, uh, how did your foster dads group go?\\
309 - I-I texted you, but you never answered.\\
310 - Really?\\
311 - I... That'   s... I must not have gotten it.\\
312 - Are you sure? Uh, it says it was read at 7:47.\\
313 - I guess it was ignored at 7:48.\\
314 - Dads group was really fun.\\
315 - Yeah, I think it'   s gonna be really gonna helpful for Louis.\\
316 - Oh, great, great. Uh, when are you gonna do it again?\\
317 - Uh... Well, you know, I was gonna actually\\
318 - have the guys over tonight.\\
319 - Tonight? The place is a mess.\\
320 - And The Good Wifeis on.\\
321 - Mmm.\\
322 - Well, I do want to meet the guys, though.\\
323 - Oh. Well, you know, it'   s a... it'   s actually, it'   s a pretty\\
324 - tight-knit group, so...\\
325 - I don'   t think people will be able to open up\\
326 - if there'   s a stranger around. Besides, don'   t...\\
327 - don'   t you and Ms. McMartin have a thing tonight?\\
328 - Nope. Uh-uh. Free as a boner in sweat pants.\\
329 - No. Come on.\\
330 - You deserve a thing, so...\\
331 - here.\\
332 - Well, I-I do deserve a thing.\\
333 - Hey, hey-- you only give me money\\
334 - when you'   re trying to get rid of me.\\
335 - No, I don'   t. Here, take more money.\\
336 - Wait, hold on. Do you...\\
337 - do you not want me around tonight?\\
338 - No, it'   s just... it'   s just...\\
339 - I had fun last night,\\
340 - and I want to have fun again tonight.\\
341 - I see. And Webster'   s defines fun as having\\
342 - or pertaining to the absence of Alan.\\
343 - From the Latin: hurticus feelingsmus.\\
344 - Okay, are you really asking why I don'   t want you around\\
345 - while you'   re talking like that?\\
346 - Oh, so you really don'   t want me around?\\
347 - Yes, or as defined in Webster'   s, affirmative.\\
348 - Don'   t take my dictionary thing.Well,\\
349 - at least you have a thing.\\
350 - I don'   t have anything for myself.\\
351 - I mean, every time I turn around, there you are.\\
352 - Oh, what? Let'   s just do it. Look, oh, there you are.\\
353 - Well, I'   m sorry if my presence offends you.\\
354 - If bags weren'   t ten cents apiece,\\
355 - I'   d put one over my head.\\
356 - Listen, I just want one thing for myself.\\
357 - One thing where you'   re not around.\\
358 - Is that too much to ask?\\
359 - Fine. If that'   s how you feel, you know,\\
360 - have your stupid little group all to yourself in our house.\\
361 - But don'   t expect me to wait to watch The Good Wife.\\
362 -     Men.   \\
363 -     Men.   \\
364 - And here'   s a picture of Heidi on a nude beach in Canc  n.\\
365 - Whoa. I can see her can.\\
366 - And her c  n.\\
367 - Alan?\\
368 - I thought you had a thing.\\
369 - Well, if you saw my feet after the paraffin dip,\\
370 - you'   d know I already had my thing.\\
371 - Don'   t worry, I won'   t spoil your little party.\\
372 - You must be the dads who are part of the group.\\
373 - I'   m the dad who'   s not part of the group.\\
374 - And here we go.\\
375 - Hey, hey, why don'   t... why don'   t you have a beer?\\
376 - Oh, no, I'   ll be in my room. I can amuse myself.\\
377 - I have a half bag of Cheetos and a radio.\\
378 - Oh, hey, hey, come on, man.\\
379 - No. Please stay.\\
380 - Well, when the boss says jump, I say how... Hi. I'   m Alan.\\
381 - Wow, what a fun way to meet someone.\\
382 - Here you go.There you go.\\
383 - Oh. Thank you, thank you. So, uh, so what'   s going on?\\
384 - Or-Or should I say whassup?!\\
385 - You remember that?\\
386 - You guys... You guys remember that? Remember?\\
387 - Whassup?!\\
388 - That is the whitest guy I have ever seen.\\
389 - Wait, wait, is that all you'   re serving?\\
390 - Chips? Not even in a bowl?\\
391 - You should be embarrassed.\\
392 - Oh, trust me, I'   m embarrassed.\\
393 - Look, nobody cares.\\
394 - Alan seems to care, and you care\\
395 - about Alan'   s feelings, don'   t you?\\
396 - Ooh, I like him. Two points for the silver fox.\\
397 - Maybe I'   ll just, uh, throw together some nachos.\\
398 - We'   re fine. The... Hey, I don'   t want you\\
399 - to go to all the trouble. See? I'   m thinking about you.\\
400 - It'   s no trouble. It'   s just, uh, chips, uh...\\
401 - [with accent]: guacamole, uh, jalape  os and, uh, queso fresco.\\
402 - My wife'   s idea of nachos\\
403 - is just dumping some salsa on chips.\\
404 - Well, I'   m nacho average wife.\\
405 - [laughing]\\
406 -     Men.   \\
407 - So this guy-- I bail him out completely,\\
408 - agree to marry him,\\
409 - and guess what we do on our wedding night.\\
410 - I-I don'   t need to hear that. No judgment.\\
411 - Nothing. We came straight home.\\
412 - Same place we went on our honeymoon.\\
413 - The guy has a jet. How hard is it to go to Aruba?\\
414 - Jamaica.\\
415 -     Ooh, I wanna take you\\
416 -     To Bermuda\\
417 -     Bahama, come on, pretty mama    \\
418 -     Key Largo, Montego\\
419 -     Baby, why don'   t we go        Ooh, I want to take you down to Kokomo    \\
420 -     We'   ll get there fast    \\
421 -     And then we'   ll take it slow    \\
422 -     That'   s where we want to go    \\
423 -     Way down in Kokomo\\
424 -     Martinique\\
425 -     That Monserrat mystique.\\
426 - [all whooping, laughing]\\
427 - That is my jam,\\
428 - and y'   all are my bitches.\\
429 -     Men.   \\
430 - What the hell are you doing?\\
431 - I'   m just being a fun guy. What are youdoing?\\
432 - You'   re about as much fun as the polyp in Rick'   s colon.\\
433 - You'   re doing exactly what I thought you would.\\
434 - You'   re taking my friends.\\
435 - Just like you take everything.\\
436 - You took my house, you took my money,\\
437 - you even took my old jeans and turned '   em into cutoffs.\\
438 - They'   re called jorts, and they look great on me.Okay,\\
439 - you knew I didn'   t want you here\\
440 - and you said you weren'   t gonna be here,\\
441 - yet here you are\\
442 - with your... [with accent]: guacamole\\
443 - and your fresco queso.\\
444 - It'   s queso fresco.You do not correct me when I'   m mocking you.\\
445 - You know what? You know what? I think...\\
446 - I think that the reason that you didn'   t want me here\\
447 - is because you were afraid\\
448 - that they were gonna like me better than you.\\
449 - Okay, I can honestly say that I have never\\
450 - had that thought in my life.\\
451 - Everything okay in here?\\
452 - Well, am I allowed\\
453 - to answer your friends, Walden?\\
454 - I'   m sorry you guys had to see this.\\
455 - Oh, come on, we'   ve all been there.\\
456 - I mean, just a while back, Jack'   s wife chased him\\
457 - around his house with a steak knife.\\
458 - Trust me, I was in no danger.\\
459 - She couldn'   t use a kitchen utensil to save her life.\\
460 - We can help you work though this.\\
461 - That'   s what the group is for.\\
462 - Yeah. Yeah, yeah,\\
463 - hey, why don'   t we do some role playing?\\
464 - Okay, you'   re... you'   re, uh, Alan,\\
465 - and you just found out that Walden\\
466 - doesn'   t want you around his friends.\\
467 - Fine. Thank you, Walden,\\
468 - for letting me live here rent-free.\\
469 - Despite not contributing anything to this household,\\
470 - I ignore even your most basic requests.\\
471 - Um...You'   re not really supposed to use this\\
472 - to attack.Wait,\\
473 - hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on.\\
474 - I'   m Walden, and I get off\\
475 - on making Alan feel bad about himself.\\
476 - Well, I'   m Alan, and I get off on everything.\\
477 - Including the stock photos\\
478 - that come from the picture frames from Target.\\
479 - That was one time. The Internet was down,\\
480 - and-and she reminded me of a girl I knew in high school.\\
481 - Yeah, we'   ve all been there. Sears catalog.\\
482 - Neiman Marcus.\\
483 - The Indian girl from the Land O'   Lakes box.\\
484 - Okay, you know what, I'   m sick of having the same fight\\
485 - over and over again.\\
486 - You know, why do we keep doing this?\\
487 - '   Cause you love him and he loves you.\\
488 - Also, where am I?\\
489 - Oh, hey, Brian, I know you'   ve been asleep for a few meetings,\\
490 - but Walden told us they'   re not actually gay.\\
491 - I know they'   re not gay. I said they love each other.\\
492 - It'   s the only thing that can explain\\
493 - why they make each other so crazy.\\
494 - You chose to adopt this kid together for a reason.\\
495 - Why don'   t you talk about that?\\
496 - [cell phone beeps]\\
497 - Oh, God, my wife said the twins are sick.\\
498 - I got to go.\\
499 - Back to sleep.\\
500 - By the way, not cool about my sister.\\
501 - No judgment?\\
502 - I'   m Alan.\\
503 - And I'   m always there for Walden whenever he needs me the most.\\
504 - And I do look good in jorts.\\
505 - And my nachos are restaurant quality.\\
506 - Well, I'   m Walden, and, uh,\\
507 - I'   ve been the best friend that Alan'   s ever had.\\
508 - [short chuckle] And also,\\
509 - I'   m not angry about the 20s\\
510 - he occasionally steals from my wallet.\\
511 - I'   m sorry I said I didn'   t want you around.\\
512 - I'   m sorry I was smothering you.\\
513 - Oh... Bring it in.I'   m s...\\
514 - Come on.\\
515 - Hey, hey...\\
516 - You know where we should go?\\
517 -     Bermuda, Bahama\\
518 -     Come on, pretty mama\\
519 -     To Key Largo, Montego, baby why don'   t we go?    \\
520 - Wait, are you really taking me to...No.\\
521 -     The Florida Keys, there'   s a place called Koko...    \\
522 -     Men.   \\
523 -     Men.   I just want to tell you guys,\\
524 - I love being a part of this group.\\
525 - And we love having you, Alan.\\
526 - Oh, well, thank you. So, as I was saying,\\
527 - why is it that I'   m willing to take\\
528 - three hours to make him dinner\\
529 - and he won'   t take three seconds to tell me what he wants?\\
530 - Speaking of three seconds, can we talk about the sex?\\
531 - [scoffs] At least you'   re having sex, sister.
\subsection {Episode 12: A Beer Battered Rip-Off}
1 -     Men.   Okay, here it is.\\
2 - This is Louis'   s first science fair project.\\
3 - You'   re gonna love it.\\
4 - Wow.\\
5 - Louis made this all by himself.\\
6 - Last time I was here,\\
7 - he got the straw from his juice box stuck in his nose.\\
8 - He also got it unstuck.\\
9 - Uh, check it out.\\
10 - So, uh, so we'   ll take a piece of bread, all right?\\
11 - Put it in the mouth,\\
12 - where the saliva will start to dissolve the bread.\\
13 - And then it'   ll travel down to the stomach,\\
14 - where the acids will break down the complex carbohydrates.\\
15 - At which point it will move past the appendix,\\
16 - which does nothing.\\
17 - Yeah, we should rename that the Alan.\\
18 - Uh, and then it'   ll go to the small intestines,\\
19 - the large intestines, where finally...\\
20 - [imitates flatulence]\\
21 - Oh, dear God.\\
22 - Uh, no, it'   s okay, it'   s a Hershey'   s Kiss.\\
23 - Okay.\\
24 - So the reason I came over is to tell you--\\
25 - we are ready to start the final steps\\
26 - for you to officially adopt Louis.\\
27 - Oh, my God, I'   m gonna Hershey'   s Kiss my pants.\\
28 - But before the adoption is final,\\
29 - I want you to tell Louis you two aren'   t gay.\\
30 - Are you sure that this is the best time to do that?\\
31 - I mean, I haven'   t even talked to him\\
32 - about the birds and the bees,\\
33 - let alone the bees and the bees.\\
34 - I know there is never a perfect time\\
35 - to tell your son his two dads aren'   t gay...\\
36 - ...but it'   ll be more harmful the longer you wait.\\
37 - Yeah, but it'   s just, like, h-how do I tell him?\\
38 - Um, does Hallmark make a "Sorry, son,\\
39 - it turns out I'   m straight" card?\\
40 - You'   ve been a fantastic father so far.\\
41 - I am confident you will handle this\\
42 - with the utmost attention and care.\\
43 - ALAN: Walden?\\
44 - Him I'   m worried about.\\
45 - Sorry I'   m late.\\
46 - Uh, I took Louis to the mall\\
47 - to get him some new school clothes.\\
48 - He'   s trying them on right now.\\
49 - Plus there was a new kiosk that will bedazzle anything.\\
50 - Got an iPhone case for my boo.\\
51 - Now, I'   m gonna bedazzle your cheek with some sugar.\\
52 - [chuckles dryly]\\
53 - Alan, as your social worker, I cannot accept gifts.\\
54 - And as your "boo," hell no.\\
55 - I can'   t believe I'   m just realizing this,\\
56 - but the perfect person to date a social worker\\
57 - is a needy child.\\
58 - We were just discussing that it would be\\
59 - in the best interest of Louis to tell him\\
60 - you two aren'   t actually gay.\\
61 - Oh, I agree 100 percent.\\
62 - I mean, it'   s not like anyone was buying either one of us\\
63 - as a gay man anyway.\\
64 - Ooh, that top is fierce, girl. Rawr.\\
65 - Louis, could you come in here for a second?\\
66 - Oh, oh, we'   re doing it right now?\\
67 - [sighs] It will be such a relief to discontinue this charade.\\
68 - What are you wearing?\\
69 - Alan says between business casual and country club chic.\\
70 - Now turn around.\\
71 - He'   s "bedazzle-ous."\\
72 - Okay, should we tell him now?\\
73 - I don'   t think he'   s gonna believe us.\\
74 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
75 -     Ah.     Men.     Men.\\
76 -     Men.   \\
77 - Oh, hey, Berta.\\
78 - I talked to Louis.\\
79 - He said you guys told him you'   re not gay.\\
80 - [door bell rings]\\
81 - Yeah, we didn'   t want to lie to him anymore.\\
82 - So now you'   re just lying to yourself.\\
83 - Lyndsey?\\
84 - Hi, Alan. Can we talk?Sure, come on in.\\
85 - Uh, can I give you a hand with your box?\\
86 - Boy, I haven'   t said that to you in a while.\\
87 - I'   ll say to you now what I said to you then.\\
88 - It'   s easier if I just do it myself.\\
89 - I was cleaning out my house,\\
90 - and I found some of your old things.\\
91 - Oh, look at this stuff.\\
92 - Oh, here'   s a picture from our Caribbean vacation.\\
93 - Oh, remember how I got stung by that jellyfish?\\
94 - Of course I do-- you made me pee on you to neutralize the pain.\\
95 - Seems like you got stung a lot on that vacation.\\
96 - Did I?\\
97 - Wow!\\
98 - Oh, look.\\
99 - Wow, my old boom box.\\
100 - Oh, and it still has that mix CD I made for us.\\
101 - "Now That'   s What I Call Nasty, Volume 69."\\
102 -     A little bit of Mary\\
103 - Ah!    All night long\\
104 -     A little bit of Jessica, here I am    \\
105 -     A little bit of you makes me your man...    \\
106 - "Mambo No. 5."\\
107 - [turns off music]\\
108 - How did I ever let you make love to me\\
109 - while you sang other women'   s names?\\
110 - Be fair, you used to scream other guys'    names.\\
111 - Anyway, I didn'   t come by just to bring you your stuff.\\
112 - I also wanted to tell you that I'   ve decided to move away.\\
113 - Get a fresh start.\\
114 - What? Uh, wh-where'   s this coming from?\\
115 - I'   ve been thinking about it for a while,\\
116 - and there'   s nothing for me here.\\
117 - I mean, most of my memories involve a time\\
118 - when I was drinking really heavily,\\
119 - and those aren'   t pretty.\\
120 - I mean, the bar by my house has a drink\\
121 - called "The Lyndsey Special."\\
122 - It'   s a bottle of Merlot, a shot of vodka\\
123 - and a scrunchie to hold your hair back while you throw up.\\
124 - So where do you think you'   re gonna go?\\
125 - Well, I have family in Arizona, so...\\
126 - not there.\\
127 - Ah, you know, I just, I can'   t believe it.\\
128 - I mean, well, I hope you don'   t forget about me completely.\\
129 - You'   re a hard person to forget, Alan Harper.\\
130 - I'   ve tried.\\
131 - Hence, "The Lyndsey Special."\\
132 - Mm.\\
133 - Anyway, I just wanted to let you know.\\
134 - This is gonna be so strange.\\
135 - I mean, even when we weren'   t together,\\
136 - it was nice knowing you were nearby.\\
137 - Ah, I know what you mean.\\
138 - Well, this is it.\\
139 - Good-bye, Alan.\\
140 - Good-bye, Lyndsey.\\
141 - [both chuckle]\\
142 - Are we really not gonna talk about the 20 bucks you owe me?\\
143 - I am really gonna miss you.\\
144 - I'   ll miss you, too.\\
145 - Let'   s go to your room.\\
146 - Okay, great.\\
147 - Ow! What'   s wrong?\\
148 - I just got stung by a jellyfish earlier, that'   s all.\\
149 -     Men.   \\
150 -     ...Jessica, here I am\\
151 -     A little bit of you makes me your...    \\
152 - Yeah, still got it.\\
153 - Sex is very different when you'   re sober.\\
154 - Now I really know how long two minutes is.\\
155 - It was a special occasion.\\
156 - I wanted to give you a little something extra.\\
157 - Well, thank you.\\
158 - This puts a nice cap on our relationship.\\
159 - Wait.\\
160 - I can'   t have this be the last time we make love.\\
161 - The last time I put on your panties.\\
162 - The last time you say, "No, not there,"\\
163 - and I pretend I was just confused.\\
164 - Look, I'   m not saying I won'   t miss you,\\
165 - but the fact is you'   re married.\\
166 - You'   re about to adopt a child.\\
167 - That'   s my point.\\
168 - The adoption is almost final, and when it is,\\
169 - Walden and I will get a divorce.\\
170 - And I misspelled my name on the prenup.\\
171 - We'   ll live like kings.\\
172 - Are you really asking me to stay?\\
173 - Yes, I mean, we'   ve shared so much over the years.\\
174 - We can'   t just throw it away like a...\\
175 - a long-running hit television show\\
176 - that still pulls in a pretty decent audience.\\
177 - I suppose it is something to think about.\\
178 - I mean, for the first time in a long time,\\
179 - neither one of us is seeing anybody else.\\
180 - Hey, do you need a bedazzled iPhone case?\\
181 - Wait, are you seeing someone?\\
182 - [scoffs] Yeah, yeah, Alan Harper has two girlfriends.\\
183 - [chuckles]\\
184 - What else do I have?\\
185 - Good credit? Health insurance?\\
186 - A job?\\
187 - This is a lot to think about.\\
188 - I'   m gonna need some time.\\
189 - Of course, take all the time you need.\\
190 - Okay.\\
191 - Look, I really do need to go.\\
192 - And I really do need my panties back.\\
193 - Oh.\\
194 -     Men.   \\
195 - LYNDSEY: Hey, Walden.\\
196 - Lyndsey?\\
197 - Uh, are you coming out of Alan'   s room?\\
198 - Uh-huh.\\
199 - You drinking again?\\
200 - Do I need to take you to a meeting?\\
201 - No, still sober.\\
202 - But I should apologize for sleeping with your husband.\\
203 - Not the first time I'   ve said that.\\
204 - See ya.\\
205 - So, okay. [mumbles]\\
206 - Alan!\\
207 - Yeah?\\
208 - Are you having sex with Lyndsey\\
209 - while you'   re sleeping with our social worker?\\
210 - Yeah, my pimp hand is strong.\\
211 - No, it'   s not!\\
212 - Look, look, this thing with Lyndsey just happened.\\
213 - A-And, honestly, I-I'   m glad it did.\\
214 - I-I really want her to give us another shot.\\
215 - What about Ms. McMartin?!\\
216 - Oh, we'   re not that serious.\\
217 - Plus, she doesn'   t get me like Lyndsey gets me.\\
218 - When I try to put Ms. McMartin'   s panties on,\\
219 - she looks at me like I'   m some kind of weirdo.\\
220 - Kind of like how I'   m looking at you right now?!\\
221 - Look, I'   m gonna see Ms. McMartin tonight,\\
222 - and I-I'   ll tell her it'   s over.\\
223 - She'   s gonna be upset-- nobody likes getting dumped.\\
224 - Oh, she'   ll be fine.\\
225 - I mean, you'   ve seen how she looks at me.\\
226 - That'   s not love.\\
227 - That'   s not even like.\\
228 - That'   s-- if we run into anyone I know,\\
229 - I'   m pretending that you'   re my slow brother.\\
230 - Alan? Mm-hmm.\\
231 - I want you to get your penis out of my business.\\
232 - Change "business" to "turkey,"\\
233 - uh, and it'   s the story\\
234 - of how a 13-year-old boy named Alan ruined Thanksgiving.\\
235 -     Men.   \\
236 - What looks good?\\
237 - And don'   t say my boobs.\\
238 - Cute.\\
239 - Funny.\\
240 - Boobs.\\
241 - Um, can we talk?\\
242 - What'   s wrong?\\
243 - Is it the restaurant?\\
244 - It'   s not too pricy, is it?\\
245 - It only had one dollar sign on Yelp.\\
246 - N-N-No, it'   s not that.\\
247 - Um, although, $14 for tilapia?\\
248 - Sounds to me like a beer-battered rip-off.\\
249 - Then what'   s going on?\\
250 - Here'   s the thing.\\
251 - I really like you, it'   s just that...\\
252 - Oh, my God, are you breaking up with me?\\
253 - Wow, Band-Aid off.\\
254 - Seriously?\\
255 - You?\\
256 - Breaking up with me?\\
257 - That?\\
258 - Breaking up with this?\\
259 - Hey, hey, there'   s no need to point.\\
260 - I mean, we both could be in better shape.\\
261 - Oh, there is only one person at this table wearing Spanx,\\
262 - and it is not me.\\
263 - Could you keep it down? People are starting to look.\\
264 - Oh, well, they'   re probably wondering\\
265 - why the old man and his nurse are arguing.\\
266 - Hey, I am not that much older than you.\\
267 - I'   m 47.\\
268 - Great, you just lost me my senior discount.\\
269 - I knew dating you was a bad idea.\\
270 - Yes, exactly.\\
271 - Louis and Walden are the priority here.\\
272 - You and I should never have complicated the adoption\\
273 - with our unbridled passion.\\
274 - We should have bridled.\\
275 - This was so stupid.\\
276 - I am so stupid.\\
277 - No, you'   re not stupid.\\
278 - You just let your unfettered desire get the best of you.\\
279 - You should have fettered.\\
280 - You know what?\\
281 - You'   re right.\\
282 - Ending this is a good thing.\\
283 - To be honest, I'   m actually a little relieved.\\
284 - Of course you are, you just dodged a bullet--\\
285 - a cheap, middle-aged, lactose-intolerant bullet.\\
286 -     Men.   [thunder rumbling]\\
287 - [doorbell rings]\\
288 - [doorbell rings]\\
289 - [doorbell rings twice]\\
290 - What is going on?\\
291 - I have no idea.\\
292 - [doorbell ringing]\\
293 - Surprise!\\
294 - It'   s inspection time!\\
295 - [thunder crashes]\\
296 -     Men.   \\
297 -     Men.   \\
298 - Look at these sharp corners on this table.\\
299 - No gate on the stairs.\\
300 - I see a lot of problems here.\\
301 - A lot of problems.\\
302 - A lot of problems.\\
303 - Believe me, I see the same problem.\\
304 - And I would like to help you get rid of your problem,\\
305 - even if that means dumping the problem'   s body in the ocean.\\
306 - If you think it'   s hard getting me out of here alive,\\
307 - try getting rid of my ghost.\\
308 - Okay, obviously this is not about the adoption.\\
309 - This is about us.\\
310 - Now, why don'   t we just sit down and talk?\\
311 - Look at this.\\
312 - A weapon in the form of a toy?\\
313 - Is it loaded?\\
314 - Yes, it is!\\
315 - You have to be careful.\\
316 - You might hurt someone you thought you cared about\\
317 - but were horribly deceived by.\\
318 - Okay, listen,\\
319 - I understand that you are very upset.\\
320 - And I agree\\
321 - that we should take this out on Alan.\\
322 - Your railings on the deck are too low,\\
323 - there'   s no safety glass on the fireplace\\
324 - and you have alcohol\\
325 - within a child'   s reach.\\
326 - We can, we can fix this.\\
327 - See? All gone.\\
328 - Ugh..\\
329 - What kind of wine is that?\\
330 - Oh, uh, uh, it'   s instant.\\
331 - It comes in a packet.\\
332 - Just add water.\\
333 - Uh, it'   s-it'   s like astronaut wine.\\
334 - And you'   re upset that this guy broke up with you?\\
335 - The only thing I'   m upset about\\
336 - is the litany of violations I found here tonight.\\
337 - You have 48 hours to address these issues.\\
338 - Keep in mind:\\
339 - I can stop by anytime I see fit.\\
340 - Anytime.\\
341 - [thunder crashes]\\
342 - Okay, say what you will,\\
343 - but that exit was cool.\\
344 - Okay, you think she'   s angry now?\\
345 - What do you think is gonna happen\\
346 - when she finds out about you and Lyndsey?\\
347 - Oh, oh, don'   t worry, I'   ll apologize to Ms. McMartin,\\
348 - and then tomorrow, when I'   m having lunch with Lyndsey,\\
349 - I'   ll tell her we have to lay low\\
350 - until the adoption goes through.\\
351 - No. I don'   t want you going\\
352 - anywhere near Ms. McMartin.\\
353 - But I think I can help... No!\\
354 - You'   ve already done enough damage.\\
355 - And I'   m warning you, you stay away.\\
356 - I am a billionaire\\
357 - and I can buy my way out of at least one murder.\\
358 - This is still America.\\
359 -     Men.   \\
360 - So, what looks good?\\
361 - And don'   t say my boobs.\\
362 - Why would I say "my boobs"\\
363 - when it'   s your boobs that I like?\\
364 - [laughs]\\
365 - Have you thought about us?\\
366 - Yes.\\
367 - I want to give it a try.\\
368 - Oh, you do?!\\
369 - Oh, that is so great. I know!\\
370 - The rest of our life together starts right now.\\
371 - Yes!\\
372 - Or in three weeks, when I can see you again.\\
373 - What?\\
374 - Oh, well, Walden is worried about the adoption.\\
375 - He doesn'   t want there to be any complications.\\
376 - So he thinks I'   ll screw it up?\\
377 - No, he thinks I'   ll screw it up.\\
378 - Oh, sure.\\
379 - So I just think it'   s better if we lay low\\
380 - until after the court date.\\
381 - I understand.\\
382 - Is that why we drove an hour away from the ocean\\
383 - to go to a seafood restaurant?\\
384 - Ah, that and...\\
385 - no corkage fee.\\
386 - Ooh.\\
387 - A pinot.\\
388 - Oh! Oh, you don'   t mind if I drink, do you?\\
389 - I can honestly say I'   ve never been less tempted.\\
390 - Good legs...\\
391 - mmm, full body...\\
392 - goes down easy.\\
393 - They should call this "The Lyndsey Special."\\
394 - Cute.\\
395 - You know, I-I certainly wouldn'   t want to do anything\\
396 - to jeopardize the adoption.\\
397 - And taking it slow is probably better for us, too.\\
398 - Oh! Lyndsey plus Alan equals "us."\\
399 - Aw... [laughs]\\
400 - Hello, Alan.\\
401 - [crashing]\\
402 - Good God!\\
403 - What-what are you doing here?\\
404 - And-and how do you keep making these dramatic entrances?\\
405 - Who is this?\\
406 - Oh. Uh, th-this is-is Lyndsey.\\
407 - Uh, Lyndsey, this is Ms. McMartin,\\
408 - our social worker.\\
409 - Uh, remember, I told you about her and the adoption?\\
410 - Um, uh, Lyndsey is my cousin,\\
411 - um, from Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\\
412 - What?\\
413 - So you make out with your cousin?\\
414 - I said she was from Iowa.\\
415 - Is this why you broke up with me?\\
416 - For her?\\
417 - Hold on.\\
418 - You'   re dating your social worker?\\
419 - He was.\\
420 - Till he dumped me last night.\\
421 - Was it just last night?\\
422 - You said you were single.\\
423 - Did I say I was single?\\
424 - Yeah. Right after we had sex.\\
425 - Did we have sex?\\
426 - You had sex with her?\\
427 - Did I have sex with her?\\
428 - You jackass!\\
429 - [glass shatters]\\
430 - Heh.\\
431 - Chicks. [chuckles]\\
432 - Crazy in the head, crazy in the bed, am I right?\\
433 - Oh, Lyndsey... Lyndsey, wait!\\
434 - I banged both of them.\\
435 - Ain'   t no thang.\\
436 -     Men.   \\
437 - Hey.\\
438 - Oh, hey, did you, uh, see Lyndsey?\\
439 - Uh, yes, I did.\\
440 - Uh, and she was totally cool with taking it slow\\
441 - until the adoption is done.\\
442 - Good. And thank you.\\
443 - Yeah, you may not want to thank me just yet.\\
444 - Um...\\
445 - Please tell me that that is your blood\\
446 - and not powdered wine.\\
447 - I-It'   s not my fault.\\
448 - Ms. McMartin showed up.What?\\
449 - She followed me. She'   s gone crazy.\\
450 - No, she hasn'   t "gone crazy."\\
451 - You drove her crazy.\\
452 - You make people crazy!\\
453 - That-that'   s a little unfair.\\
454 - I mean, I grant you that, you know,\\
455 - maybe it was a mistake to sleep with her,\\
456 - but when a woman has five cats,\\
457 - she doesn'   t have to be "made crazy."\\
458 - You know what? You'   re right.\\
459 - This-this-this is my fault.\\
460 - I'   m the one who made the mistake.\\
461 - You are? Yes.\\
462 - I mistakenly thought that you were\\
463 - a capable, competent human being,\\
464 - able to handle a simple situation\\
465 - without destroying the life of everyone around you.\\
466 - Boy, if I had a dollar\\
467 - for every time someone has said that to me.\\
468 - But seriously, seriously, I-I will fix this.\\
469 - [laughing]: Oh. Great.\\
470 - You'   re gonna fix this. Yeah.\\
471 - I mean, why was I worried?\\
472 - Have no fear!\\
473 - Alan is here!\\
474 - Hey! Hey, everyone!\\
475 - Don'   t worry!\\
476 - Alan'   s gonna fix it!\\
477 - Sailors at sea,\\
478 - throw away your life vests!\\
479 - You don'   t need them!\\
480 - '   Cause Alan is gonna fix everything!\\
481 - Maybe I do make people crazy.\\
482 -     Men.   \\
483 - Walden? What are you doing here?\\
484 - I am on the "Alan Harper Apology Tour."\\
485 - Uh, but this is gonna require\\
486 - a little bit of audience participation.\\
487 - When I say "Alan," you say "idiot."\\
488 - Alan. Idiot.\\
489 - Alan. Idiot.\\
490 - This is fun. Come in.\\
491 - Wow, this is nice.\\
492 - And it doesn'   t smell like cat urine at all.\\
493 - So what do you want, Walden?\\
494 - I realize that Alan--\\
495 - Idiot.\\
496 - Look, I-I realize that he can do some stupid things.\\
497 - And I'   m-I'   m sure you'   ve seen his helicopter dance,\\
498 - where he uses his penis as the propeller.\\
499 - Actually, I haven'   t.\\
500 - Neither have I.\\
501 - I realize how angry you must be with him.\\
502 - But that has nothing to do\\
503 - with the kind of father I can be to Louis.\\
504 - I know that.\\
505 - It'   s just that Alan--\\
506 - Idiot.\\
507 - Ha!\\
508 - He makes me crazy.\\
509 - I-I just said that!\\
510 - In-in fact, I hit a lifeguard\\
511 - with a patio chair saying that.\\
512 - Look, Walden, at the end of the day,\\
513 - I'   m not gonna let my anger prevent a child\\
514 - from being placed in a good home.\\
515 - Thank God.\\
516 - I just... I'   ve never realized\\
517 - how much another person can mean to me.\\
518 - That is so sweet.\\
519 - [sobbing]: Why can'   t anybody\\
520 - ever think that about me?\\
521 - I am such a loser!\\
522 - No, you'   re not a loser, Ms. McMartin.\\
523 - Yes, I am!\\
524 - I thought I hit rock bottom\\
525 - by dating an old guy who can'   t get a boner.\\
526 - It turns out, rock bottom is getting dumped\\
527 - by the old guy who can'   t get a boner.\\
528 - What is wrong with me?\\
529 - Nothing.\\
530 - Come on, you'   re smart and you'   re fun...\\
531 - And, oh, by the way,\\
532 - you are way too pretty for Alan.\\
533 - Oh. [laughs]\\
534 - So are you.\\
535 - See?\\
536 - Now there'   s that smile.\\
537 - Come on, now, now...\\
538 - any guy would be lucky to be with you.\\
539 - Oh, you'   re just saying that.\\
540 - No, you'   re awesome.\\
541 - And what you do for a living, helping those kids,\\
542 - changing their lives,\\
543 - putting your hand on my leg...\\
544 - Wow.\\
545 - [giggles]\\
546 - I can'   t believe this.\\
547 - You'   re not the only one.\\
548 - I don'   t want you to worry.\\
549 - I'   m not going to let the fact\\
550 - that we are in a relationship affect Louis.\\
551 - Learned that lesson, am I right?\\
552 - [laughs]\\
553 - Yeah.\\
554 - Relationship.\\
555 - Okay.\\
556 - I am going to go... Where?\\
557 - Where are you going?\\
558 - To the bathroom.\\
559 - Oh, okay.\\

561 - Hurry back.\\
562 - [singsong]: I'   ll miss you.\\
563 - I'   ll miss you, too.\\
564 - Ooh, it'   s a little chilly out there.\\
565 - I'   m gonna grab my pants.\\
566 - And my car keys.\\

568 -     Take one step left and one step right    \\
569 -     One to the front and one to the side    \\

571 - Alan?    And if it looks like this, then you'   re doing it right    \\

1 -     Men.   \\
2 - Sex is so much better with someone you know well.\\
3 - Yeah.Mm-hmm.\\
4 - That'   s why so many marriages last forever.\\
5 - [both cackling]\\
6 - But it'   s true, it'   s true-- sex is better when you,\\
7 - you know, you know the other person'   s rhythms,\\
8 - what they like,\\
9 - which leg they can put behind their head.\\
10 - I'   m still impressed you can do that.\\
11 - Uh, yoga.\\
12 - When I started, I was single and I wanted to be\\
13 - flexible enough to give myself a...\\
14 - You know, I, uh, I-I really would have missed you\\
15 - if you moved to San Francisco.\\
16 - Aw, me, too.\\
17 - Although maybe I should have waited to sell the house.\\
18 - I got to be out of here in two weeks.Mm.\\
19 - I could help you find an apartment.\\
20 - Unless you want me to stay out of your hair.\\
21 - Hey, that'   s the second time I said that tonight.\\
22 - Actually, I really could use your help.\\
23 - I mean, unless you'   re busy with work.\\
24 - [both cackling]\\
25 - Oh, I love you, Lyndsey.\\
26 - I love you, too, Alan.\\
27 - You want to go again?No.\\
28 - You satisfied me the first time.\\
29 - [both cackling]\\
30 -     Men.   \\
31 - Walden, do you believe in destiny?\\
32 - I believe in\\
33 - Destiny'   s Child.\\
34 - I'   m serious.\\
35 - Think of everything that happened\\
36 - that led us to this moment.\\
37 - Oh, see, that... I'   d rather not.\\
38 - I know you don'   t want to talk about my relationship with Alan.\\
39 - No, I don'   t. I don'   t even like\\
40 - sharing a cab with Alan.\\
41 - But don'   t you see? If Alan and I hadn'   t been together\\
42 - and I hadn'   t freaked out when he rejected me,\\
43 - you wouldn'   t be here to comfort me.\\
44 - In a way, I just want to say\\
45 - thank you, Alan Harper.\\
46 - Yeah.\\
47 - Thank you, Alan Harper.\\
48 - So-So you are aware that you...\\
49 - ...freaked out a little bit.\\
50 - You mean when I showed up to your house at midnight\\
51 - in the rain or when I followed Alan for 12 straight hours\\
52 - and peed in a bottle in my car?\\
53 - I didn'   t know you did that. That'   s...\\
54 - Look at us, getting to know each other.\\
55 - [soft chuckle]\\
56 - So-So was that\\
57 - out of character for you, would you say?\\
58 - Well, I admit, I am not good with rejection.\\
59 - Who is?\\
60 - Well, don'   t worry.\\
61 - I am never, ever gonna let go of you.\\
62 - I believe you.\\
63 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
64 -     Ah.     Men.     Men.\\
65 -     Men.   \\
66 - Uh-oh.\\
67 - I'   ll let you know when I'   m done.\\
68 - Okay, once again,\\
69 - I will buy you another Lego mini figure.\\
70 - We don'   t have to wait for that one to come out.\\
71 - Hey.\\
72 - Oh, you always know when I'   ve had sex.\\
73 - What gave it away?\\
74 - The bounce in my step or the glow in my cheek?\\
75 - No, it'   s probably the, uh, text\\
76 - I got from you that said,\\
77 - "Guess why I can'   t see my penis right now."\\
78 - I was bored.\\
79 - So, uh, how was your little talk with Ms. McMartin?\\
80 - You know, about that whole situation-- you and her--\\
81 - I just... you know, maybe I just judged you too harshly.\\
82 - No, no, I was... I deserved it. I-I was stupid and weak.\\
83 - And besides, bitch be crazy.\\
84 - Yeah. Well...\\
85 - bitch be my girlfriend.\\
86 - Oh, my God. You didn'   t.\\
87 - After all the crap you gave me?\\
88 - "How could you sleep with our social worker, Alan?"\\
89 - "Get your penis out of my business, Alan."\\
90 - "That'   s not what yoga is for, Alan."\\
91 - Okay, fine, I admit it. I-I made a mistake.\\
92 - I just... I Alan'   d this whole thing up.\\
93 - My name as a verb. I like it.\\
94 - So-So how did this happen?\\
95 - I don'   t know. I just... I went over there and then...\\
96 - she got all emotional\\
97 - and kept calling herself a loser and then...\\
98 - Okay, and then she started to cry.\\
99 - Oh, crying. She used that to turn me on, too.\\
100 - What? No. I-I comforted her\\
101 - and then one thing led to an... You'   re a freak.\\
102 - Hey, hey, don'   t call me a freak.\\
103 - You'   re the one who Alan'   d it up.\\
104 - You know what, maybe it'   ll be okay.\\
105 - I mean, she only goes crazy when she gets rejected,\\
106 - so I just have to keep her happy for a couple days\\
107 - until we finalize Louis'   s adoption.\\
108 - See, I just...\\
109 - I feel bad, '   cause...\\
110 - I mean, she already fell head over heels in love with me.\\
111 - She Walden'   d you.\\
112 - You know what?\\
113 - Go Alan yourself.\\
114 - Thanks to yoga, I can.\\
115 -     Men.   \\
116 - This is great.\\
117 - Lots of natural light, hardwood floors,\\
118 - and it'   s next to a Chipotle.\\
119 - I can'   t wait for our first post-booty burrito.\\
120 - It'   s also right across the street\\
121 - from a really cute bookstore.\\
122 - Remember books?\\
123 - And-and you saw how big those closets are.\\
124 - I could live in those things.\\
125 - Not a good idea.\\
126 - I already have enough people asking me\\
127 - if you'   re in the closet.\\
128 - People think I'   m gay?\\
129 - That'   s hilarious.\\
130 - Can'   t wait to tell my husband.\\
131 - So... do you really like it?\\
132 - [scoffs] What'   s not to like?\\
133 - This place is amazing.\\
134 - Good. '   Cause I was thinking\\
135 - maybe instead of visiting,\\
136 - why don'   t you move in with me?\\
137 - In this dump?\\
138 - You just said you liked it.\\
139 - That was when I thought it was for you.\\
140 - But for the two of us?\\
141 - There'   s no study.\\
142 - Where would I write my novel?\\
143 - You'   re writing a novel?\\
144 - Well, when I finish my screenplay.\\
145 - Do you not want to live with me?\\
146 - No, of course I do.\\
147 - But I-I want our place to be perfect.\\
148 - Like you.\\
149 - Uh, and I don'   t care how long it takes to find it.\\
150 - You have two weeks.\\
151 - [scoffs] Two weeks?\\
152 - That'   s-that'   s plenty of time to find an apartment\\
153 - and finish Alan Harper: Vampire Hunter.\\
154 -     Men.   \\
155 - There you are!\\
156 - [screams]\\
157 - Hi!\\
158 - There you are!\\
159 - In my kitchen.\\
160 - Holding a knife.\\
161 - Oh, I'   m sorry.\\
162 - I wanted to surprise you.\\
163 - Well, I peed a little, so...\\
164 - good job.\\
165 - Wh-Who... How did you get in here?\\
166 - Berta.\\
167 - I told her I was cooking for you.\\
168 - She said, "Great. Clean the toilets, too."\\
169 - Then she grabbed a six-pack and she went home.\\
170 - So it'   s just me and you.\\
171 - There'   s no witnesses.\\
172 - [laughs]\\
173 - You are so funny.\\
174 - [laughs]\\
175 - It'   s like dating Jimmy Fallon.\\
176 - [laughs]\\
177 - I'   m making you crab cakes.\\
178 - What...? Really? I love crab cakes.\\
179 - I know.\\
180 - You told me the happiest summer you ever had\\
181 - was when your family rented that house in Maryland\\
182 - and your grandpa took you crabbing.\\
183 - I remember when we were there and he said,\\
184 - "You know, when you turn 18, I'   m gonna take you to Vegas\\
185 - and we'   ll get a different kind of crabs."\\
186 - Ah, yeah.\\
187 - Then he laughed.\\
188 - Oh, how Boompa loved his hookers.\\
189 - Hey, this is very nice, but maybe next time...\\
190 - Oh! I also have your favorite dessert.\\
191 - Did I tell you about Gam-Gam'   s apple pie?\\
192 - That'   s not Gam-Gam'   s pie.\\
193 -     Men.   \\
194 - Hey.\\
195 - Oh, hey. Where you been?\\
196 - Apartment hunting.\\
197 - [gagging]\\
198 - Are you... Really?\\
199 - Oh, my God, you do hear my prayers.\\
200 - Don'   t get excited.\\
201 - It was for Lyndsey.\\
202 - Oh. Damn you.\\
203 - But get this: She asked me to move in with her.\\
204 - All right, you got me.\\
205 - There'   s no way I'   m doing it.\\
206 - Ah, you'   re dead to me!\\
207 - So, uh, how'   s it going with Ms. McCrazy?\\
208 - You know what? That'   ll be enough of that.\\
209 - Oh, sorry.\\
210 - [whispering]: She might be listening.\\
211 - No, I'   m just...\\
212 - Seriously, Ms. McMartin is a genuinely nice person.\\
213 - I just...\\
214 - I feel bad about, like, stringing her along.\\
215 - Yeah, but you can'   t break up with her.\\
216 - It'   ll jeopardize the adoption.\\
217 - I know, but, like, lying to her\\
218 - just seems cowardly and selfish.\\
219 - Well, you know what they say.\\
220 - One man'   s cowardly and selfish\\
221 - is another man'   s approach to everything in life.\\
222 - No, you know what?\\
223 - She didn'   t take Louis away\\
224 - when she found out our marriage was fake.\\
225 - And she didn'   t take him away when you dumped her, so...\\
226 - Like, she'   s gonna do the right thing.\\
227 - So am I.\\
228 - Good for you.\\
229 - You make me want to be a better man.\\
230 - Hey, uh, i-is Louis home?\\
231 - No, he'   s staying at a friend'   s house.\\
232 - Good. I can watch porn without headphones.\\
233 - Oh, I get it now.\\
234 - I'   m inhell.\\
235 -     Men.   \\
236 - Come on, baby.\\
237 - Get off that laptop and get on top of this lap.\\
238 - [laughs]\\
239 - I'   m trying to find us a place to live.\\
240 - Oh! How about this one?\\
241 - It'   s got a community hot tub.\\
242 - Yes, that'   s great.\\
243 - Uh, because when I'   m stuck in traffic,\\
244 - uh, and I look at the stranger in the next car\\
245 - and he'   s picking his nose, I'   m always thinking,\\
246 - "Boy, I'   d like to sit in stagnant water with that guy."\\
247 - Okay, no hot tub.\\
248 - Hey, how about a two-bedroom loft downtown?\\
249 - It'   s got a washer and dryer.\\
250 - And no green space for my herb garden.\\
251 - Do you even know me? [sighs]\\
252 - Okay.\\
253 - Describe your perfect place.\\
254 - Uh, it'   s a beautiful home,\\
255 - it'   s on the beach,\\
256 - it has a housekeeper\\
257 - and it'   s owned by a billionaire\\
258 - who doesn'   t monitor his change jar.\\
259 - You'   re just describing this house.\\
260 - Wow, you'   re right.\\
261 - That worked out. Let'   s have sex.\\
262 - Alan...\\
263 - I'   ve made a lot of changes in my life\\
264 - and I was excited about starting all over with you,\\
265 - but I cannot go through this same pattern\\
266 - over and over again.\\
267 - You love this house more than you love me.\\
268 - Oh, I'   m sorry.\\
269 - Was that a question?\\
270 - Good-bye, Alan.\\
271 - Oh, come... This is so unfair.\\
272 - Until you went to rehab last month,\\
273 - you loved vodka more than me.\\
274 - And when I'   ve had too much house,\\
275 - I don'   t get naked in the Walmart.\\
276 -     Men.   \\
277 -     Men.   \\
278 - Oh, hey, uh, Berta.\\
279 - When Ms. McMartin gets here, can you give us some privacy?\\
280 - I gotta talk to her.\\
281 - Oh, God.\\
282 - When are you gonna stop proposing to all these women?\\
283 - Zoey, Kate...\\
284 - Alan.Uh...\\
285 - actually, I'   m gonna break up with her.\\
286 - If you want, I can pull together a breakup kit\\
287 - like I used to do for Charlie.\\
288 - It'   s a pint of Ha  agen Dazs,\\
289 - a bottle of wine\\
290 - and the only copy of your sex tapes.\\
291 - [doorbell rings]\\
292 - Hey, Walden.\\
293 - Hey, Berta!\\
294 - What'   s your favorite flavor of ice cream?\\
295 - Why?\\
296 - No reason.\\
297 - Hey, thanks for coming.\\
298 - Why are you with me?\\
299 - Good, good. How are you?\\
300 - Are you with me because you'   re afraid\\
301 - if you break up with me, I'   ll screw up the adoption?\\
302 - What?!\\
303 - No!\\
304 - Come... I just, uh...\\
305 - Berta, how we coming with that ice cream?\\
306 - Please be honest with me.\\
307 - Okay, to be honest...\\
308 - yeah, I did think that.\\
309 - But then I realized that you would never\\
310 - ever do something like that.\\
311 - I was doing that.\\
312 - I knew it!\\
313 - This morning, I was going over your paperwork,\\
314 - and I literally considered postponing the final hearing\\
315 - because I was afraid, as soon as it happened,\\
316 - you would leave me.\\
317 - I would never do that to you.\\
318 - I was gonna break up with you right now.\\
319 - So, you agree.\\
320 - We shouldn'   t see each other anymore.\\
321 - Here.\\
322 - What'   s this?\\
323 - It'   s the final adoption forms.\\
324 - You have a court date tomorrow\\
325 - and everything'   s gonna sail through.\\
326 - Congratulations. Louis is yours.\\
327 - Oh, really?\\
328 - Oh... oh, my God, thank you.\\
329 - Ah, you know this is a\\
330 - "thank you for being a great social worker" hug,\\
331 - not a "I want you back" hug.\\
332 - Yeah, I know.\\
333 - And don'   t worry, I'   m not gonna go all crazy\\
334 - and freak out on you.\\
335 - Come on, I know that.\\
336 - I froze your sperm.\\
337 -     Men.   \\
338 - Okay, buddy, here we go. This is the first time\\
339 - we'   re walking into this house as an official family.\\
340 - Cool.\\
341 - Walden Schmidt, Louis Schmidt\\
342 - and a big pile of Schmidt.\\
343 - Ah!\\
344 - Hey, you know, now that you'   re my son,\\
345 - someday all of this is gonna be yours.\\
346 - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let'   s not get ahead of ourselves.\\
347 - So, what should we do to celebrate\\
348 - this special family day?\\
349 - I'   m going to play Legos in my room!\\
350 - Oh, oh, uh, you mean,\\
351 - "I'   m going to play Legos in my room, Dad."\\
352 - I'   m going home to get high.\\
353 - I mean, I'   m going home to get high...\\
354 - Dad.\\
355 - Seriously, I'   m happy for you.\\
356 - And I want you to know I'   m, I'   m here whenever you need me.\\
357 - Alan, you'   re not getting the house.\\
358 - Damn it!\\
359 - This is weird.\\
360 - Feel like I should be doing something dad-like.\\
361 - Like drinking beers outside.\\
362 - Or grilling something.\\
363 - You know, something manly.\\
364 - Oh, perfect!\\
365 - Uh, I have a nice, thick\\
366 - Portobello mushroom you can grill.\\
367 - I said "something manly."\\
368 - Well, if you close your eyes, you'   ll swear you have\\
369 - a piece of meat in your mouth.\\
370 - I'   m never closing my eyes again.\\
371 - Just give me a beer.\\
372 - So, uh, how'   s it going with Ms. McMartin?\\
373 - She seemed a little standoffish at the courthouse.\\
374 - You know, I think she was just trying\\
375 - to keep things professional.\\
376 - There'   s nothing going on between us anymore.\\
377 - Guess it doesn'   t matter.\\
378 - We always knew it would end up like this.\\
379 - Just you and me.\\
380 - Couple of cool bros,\\
381 - couple of chilled brews...\\
382 - and a couple of grilled '   bellos.\\
383 - Stop trying to shove your mushrooms down my throat!\\
384 - My point is we don'   t need anything else to be happy.\\
385 - [grunts] Or anyone.\\
386 - Right, right!\\
387 - Let Lyndsey move to San Francisco.\\
388 - There'   s no way I'   m giving up all this for her!\\
389 - I mean, look at this house!\\
390 - Look at the ocean and the view!\\
391 - That'   s why you broke up?\\
392 - You had a choice between Lyndsey\\
393 - and this house,\\
394 - and you chose this house?\\
395 - Yep.\\
396 - Okay, you gave up a relationship with a woman who knows\\
397 - everything about you and still wants to be with you\\
398 - because you didn'   t want to leave this house?\\
399 - Yep.\\
400 - Okay, as I'   m saying this out loud,\\
401 - you are realizing what a moron you are, aren'   t you?\\
402 - Yep.\\
403 - But-but I'   m not the only one.\\
404 - Ms. McMartin is perfect for you.\\
405 - Come on, you'   re the one who said she was crazy.\\
406 - Yes, yes, but when you really look at it, what has she done?\\
407 - I mean, she fell in love too quickly... like you.\\
408 - She only wants what'   s best for Louis...\\
409 - like you.\\
410 - She'   s inexplicably drawn to me...\\
411 - like you.\\
412 - She did surprise me by cooking my favorite meal naked.\\
413 - Sadly, like you.\\
414 - I mean, at least I-I traded Lyndsey for a house.\\
415 - What did you trade Ms. McMartin for?\\
416 - Nothing.\\
417 - It'   s worse!\\
418 - I traded her for you!\\
419 - Oh, my God! We'   re idiots!\\
420 - I know. We'   re gonna die alone!\\
421 - Worse! We'   re gonna die with each other!\\
422 - Go to Ms. McMartin!\\
423 - I will! Go to Lyndsey!\\
424 - I will! I love you!\\
425 - Oh, not the right time.Knew that.\\
426 -     Men.   \\
427 - There you are.\\
428 - [screams][grunting]\\
429 - Walden?\\
430 - Surprise.\\
431 - Oh, I'   m so sorry!\\
432 - I thought you were an intruder.\\
433 - But how did you get in my apartment?\\
434 - Well, I was gonna, um...\\
435 - rent the vacant apartment above you,\\
436 - and then rappel down the building\\
437 - and smash through the window, like Bruce Willis in Die Hard.\\
438 - But then I just looked under your mat,\\
439 - and I found your spare key.\\
440 - Oh! That'   s for my cat psychic.\\
441 - Wha...? Your what?\\
442 - What do you want?\\
443 - I-I remembered that your favorite meal was\\
444 - pan-seared salmon with orange miso glaze.\\
445 - Oh, my God, you made that for me?\\
446 - No. Uh, I made...\\
447 - uh, grilled cheese since it'   s\\
448 - the only thing I know how to make.\\
449 - But the important thing is I remembered.\\
450 - Well, that'   s very sweet.\\
451 - But... why?\\
452 - I wanted to give us another chance.\\
453 - Oh... oh, I don'   t know, Walden...\\
454 - B-Before you say anything else, just... listen to this.\\
455 -     When a man\\
456 -     Loves a social worker.\\
457 -     Men.   \\
458 - Hi. Uh, my girlfriend is about to leave for San Francisco,\\
459 - and I need a ticket on the 7:35 flight.\\
460 - Unfortunately, there'   s only one seat left,\\
461 - and that'   s in first class.\\
462 - Oh, how much is it?$1,100.\\
463 - Oh, go to hell!\\
464 - I'   m sorry, that was not, uh, directed at you.\\
465 - Uh, you know what, uh, uh, Karen?\\
466 - Uh, is it possible that someone\\
467 - who already has a coach seat\\
468 - could be bumped for some reason?\\
469 - Or...\\
470 - say, if I give you...\\
471 - ten reasons?\\
472 - And you give me five reasons back?\\
473 - Sir, I cannot accept a bribe.\\
474 - And I certainly cannot give you change for a bribe.\\
475 - You don'   t understand how important it is\\
476 - for me to get this ticket!\\
477 - I will do anything.\\
478 - Anything.\\
479 - Perhaps Karen wants\\
480 - to get her groove back?\\
481 - There is one thing you can do.\\
482 - Name it.\\
483 - You can give me $1,100.\\
484 - I just... I just need to get to that gate\\
485 - before my girlfriend boards that plane.\\
486 - I-I need to tell her that-that I-I love her\\
487 - and I was wrong and I want to spend my life with her.\\
488 - I'   m sorry, you should'   ve mentioned that before.\\
489 - We have a special fare for big romantic gestures.\\
490 - And it'   s $1,100.\\
491 - Fine.\\
492 - I'   ll go.\\
493 - Karen: 1,100.\\
494 - Love: zero.\\
495 -     When a man loves a woman\\
496 -     He can'   t keep his mind...    \\
497 - I also remembered how you love Michael Bolton.\\
498 - [laughs]\\
499 - Michael Bubl  .\\
500 - Oh.\\
501 -     If she'   s bad, he can'   t...    \\
502 - Bolton.\\
503 - You know any Bubl  ?\\
504 - God, no.\\
505 - Okay, we'   re done here.\\
506 - What are you looking at?\\
507 - Get the hell out of here, Bolton!\\
508 - Fine.\\
509 - I gave up singing the national anthem\\
510 - at the Lakers game for this.\\
511 -     When a man loves\\
512 -     Grilled cheese sandwiches.\\
513 - [door closes]\\
514 - So, what do you say?\\
515 - Will you give us another chance?\\
516 - Walden, this is kind of the man-woman playbook.\\
517 - I dumped you, and now you want to be with me\\
518 - because you want what you can'   t have.\\
519 - Oh, God, you'   re so smart. Let'   s make out.\\
520 - I'   m serious.\\
521 - Well, so am I!\\
522 - Come on, you'   re kind and you'   re generous.\\
523 - And it... and it'   s cute how you turn on the water\\
524 - in the bathroom so you think I can'   t hear you peeing.\\
525 - Plus, we'   re good in bed together.\\
526 - True.\\
527 - Although, after Alan, anyone was gonna look good.\\
528 - Okay, I will give you, like, a billion dollars\\
529 - if you never bring that up again.\\
530 - Look, you don'   t have to give me money\\
531 - when you want me to do something-- just ask.\\
532 - Why can'   t you be my husband?\\
533 - I have to admit, it would be kind of nice\\
534 - to have Bolton singing right now.Oh.\\
535 -     When a man loves a woman...\\
536 -     Men.   \\
537 -     Men.   \\
538 - Boarding pass?Oh!\\
539 - Here you go, good sir.\\
540 - This is a Chinese takeout menu.\\
541 - Okay, okay, um, I do not have,\\
542 - uh, a boarding pass.\\
543 - But if you will let me go to that gate,\\
544 - I'   ll do anything.\\
545 - Anything.\\
546 - You can'   t go to the gate without a boarding pass.\\
547 - Have you ever been in love, sir?\\
548 - Yes. With America.\\
549 - Who I'   m here to protect.\\
550 - That'   s why nobody gets through without a boarding pass.\\
551 - Someone left a bag unattended!\\
552 - Lyndsey!\\
553 - We'   ve got a runner!\\
554 - Lyndsey! Lyndsey!\\

1 -     Men.   \\
2 - Morning.\\
3 - Oh, morning, Lyndsey.\\
4 - Have you two officially met?\\
5 - We have, actually.\\
6 - Remember when you were stalking Alan\\
7 - and you followed him to a restaurant\\
8 - to catch him with his whore?\\
9 - I was that whore!\\
10 - [laughing] Oh, my God.\\
11 - That was you?\\
12 - Yes. You know, I remember thinking,\\
13 - "What is such a beautiful woman doing with Alan?"\\
14 - I thought the same thing about you.\\
15 - "What are we doing with Alan?"\\
16 - And here I was worried you two would have nothing in common.\\
17 - Care for a mimosa?Oh, no,\\
18 - thanks, I'   m recently sober. I'   m cutting down\\
19 - on the self-destructive choices in my life.\\
20 - Morning.\\
21 - And she'   s down to one.\\
22 - ALAN: Oh!\\
23 - Oh, this is so uncomfortable.What?\\
24 - Well, I'   m about to have breakfast with my current lover,\\
25 - my former lover, and my husband.\\
26 - Oh, my God, I'   m turning into my mother.\\
27 - Well, to be fair,\\
28 - your mother slept with a lot more women.\\
29 - Oh, hey, our, uh, three-month anniversary\\
30 - is on Valentine'   s Day. What should we do?\\
31 - I don'   t know. I was thinking we could get dressed up\\
32 - and put on some cologne and get some flowers\\
33 - and go to a romantic dinner...\\
34 - Ooh, I like it.\\
35 - ...with our girlfriends.\\
36 - Our girlfriends? But it'   s Valentine'   s Day.\\
37 - I can'   t believe I'   m in a relationship with a married man.\\
38 - Eh. By the third time, you get used to it.\\
39 - WALDEN: You know what,\\
40 - that'   s actually a really good point.\\
41 - Since Louis'    adoption'   s final, why are we still married?\\
42 - Uh, because we love each other.\\
43 - See? They always promise they'   re gonna get out of their marriage,\\
44 - but they never do.\\
45 - Alan, I want a divorce.\\
46 - Wow. Just get right to it.\\
47 - Happy Valentine'   s Day to Alan.\\
48 - Oh, come on. This was never a real marriage.\\
49 - And these aren'   t real tears, either.\\
50 - I'   m a stone-hearted bastard, too!\\
51 - You know what, Walden, you can keep him.\\
52 - [sighs] All right.\\
53 - I'   ll go get him before I find him masturbating\\
54 - in a pool of his own tears.\\
55 - Been there. Been there.\\
56 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
57 -     Ah.     Men.     Men.\\
58 -     Men.   \\
59 - Can we make pancakes?\\
60 - Oh. You know, I'   m sorry, buddy. I can'   t right now.\\
61 - I'   m k... I'   m kind of busy.\\
62 - Y-You remember how I told you\\
63 - that Alan and I aren'   t gonna be married anymore?\\
64 - [sadly]: Yeah.\\
65 - Are you sad about the divorce?\\
66 - No. I'   m sad about the pancakes.\\
67 - Hey.Oh, hey. Great.\\
68 - Uh, you know what, I'   m working on our divorce papers.\\
69 - I need you to sign right here.\\
70 - What about dividing our assets?\\
71 - Well, we both get what we had\\
72 - when we came into the marriage.\\
73 - So you get the house and the car\\
74 - and the billion dollars and the private jet?\\
75 - Yep.\\
76 - And you'   ll get that shirt.\\
77 - You know what? I'   ll go first.\\
78 - You know, this isn'   t easy for me either.\\
79 - Does the beach house and the private jet\\
80 - and the billion dollars make it easier?\\
81 - Duh.\\
82 - But this is still the best relationship I'   ve ever been in.\\
83 - Hmm. It'   s funny.\\
84 - When Judith and I got divorced, she said,\\
85 - "If you don'   t leave, I will kill you."\\
86 - I believed her.\\
87 - Here. Your turn.\\
88 - I can'   t. My hand knows it'   s wrong.\\
89 - Your hand does a lot of things it knows is wrong.\\
90 - Just sign it.\\
91 - [sighs]\\
92 - [sighs] Good-bye...\\
93 - Dr. Alan Harper-Schmidt.\\
94 - I hardly knew ye.\\
95 - Thank you. I really appreciate you doing this whole thing.\\
96 - You know, in fact, I'   d like to get you a gift to say thank you.\\
97 - Well, that'   s very nice, but I didn'   t do it for a gift.\\
98 - You'   re my best friend, and I would walk through fire...\\
99 - What kind of a gift are we talking about?\\
100 - Whatever you want.\\
101 - Don'   t worry about the cost. You deserve it.\\
102 - Oh, wow.\\
103 - This is exciting.\\
104 - You'   re like a genie.\\
105 - What do I rub to make my wish come true?\\
106 - I heard it.\\
107 - Oh. I-I already know what my wish will be.\\
108 - You can'   t wish for more wishes.\\
109 - Damn it.\\
110 - So-so what are the limits?\\
111 - Are we talking a trip to Disneyland?\\
112 - More than that.\\
113 - Owning Disneyland?\\
114 - Less than that.\\
115 - I really want to own Disneyland.\\
116 - Then the Little Mermaid can'   t tell me,\\
117 - "Pictures with children only."\\
118 - Okay, I-I know my parameters, I just have to think about it.\\
119 - Can I have a wish?\\
120 - I'   ll give you a hint: it'   s pancakes.\\
121 - You know what, fine, I'   ll get you pancakes.\\
122 - That'   s how it'   s done.\\
123 -     Men.   \\
124 - I'   m sorry, so, after living in his guesthouse for free\\
125 - for four years, your billionaire friend\\
126 - is granting you a wish? [scoffs]\\
127 - Just one. [scoffs]\\
128 - This is so hard.\\
129 - Yeah. What do you get for a guy who has... nothing?\\
130 - No, I'   m serious.\\
131 - This is a very tricky negotiation.\\
132 - He'   ll-he'   ll hate me if I ask for too much,\\
133 - but I'   ll hate myself if I ask for too little.\\
134 - I mean...\\
135 - I'   ll hate myself either way, but I could be hating myself\\
136 - while Michael Caine is my butler for a day.\\
137 - [imitating Michael Caine]: Shall I bring the Volvo round then, sir?\\
138 - Okay. What do you have so far, besides Michael Caine?\\
139 - Well, right now there'   s a range of things.\\
140 - A new computer, a real bed,\\
141 - um, $10,000 to my favorite charity...\\
142 - Wow, that'   s very generous.\\
143 - That was just in case somebody else saw my list.\\
144 - Don'   t you think it should be something that lasts\\
145 - for a while, something that sets you up for the future?\\
146 - Uh, number five, penis enlargement.\\
147 - Just promise me you'   ll pick something practical.\\
148 - Right. Right. Practical. Got to think practical.\\
149 - Hey, um, if you had the right kind of saddle,\\
150 - could you ride a giant panda?\\
151 -     Men.   \\
152 - Don'   t peek. I want it to be a surprise.\\
153 - Please don'   t be a panda.\\
154 - Please don'   t be a panda.\\
155 - It'   s not a panda. But that would be awesome.\\
156 - Can you ride a panda?[scoffs]\\
157 - I wish. Apparently it'   s animal cruelty.\\
158 - PETA ruins everything.\\
159 - Can I uncover my eyes?\\
160 - Uh, ooh, one second.\\
161 - Is he getting naked?\\
162 - If he was, I'   d be covering myeyes.\\
163 - ALAN: Okay, open your eyes.\\
164 - Wow.\\
165 - What do you think?\\
166 - I think he should'   ve gotten the penis enlargement.\\
167 - This thing must have cost a fortune.\\
168 - Oh, it'   s not as expensive as you think.\\
169 - Plus, I traded in my Volvo.\\
170 - Yeah, it paid for his first tank of gas.\\
171 - You had one wish and this is what you asked for?\\
172 - Yeah. Five people flipped me off on the way home.\\
173 - It was awesome.\\
174 - WALDEN: Oh, plus,\\
175 - you won'   t have to explain your relationship\\
176 - to your friends anymore. They all ask,Mmm.\\
177 - "What are you doing with Alan?" But nobody asks,\\
178 - "What are you doing with the guy in the Ferrari?"\\
179 - BERTA: Oh, wow.\\
180 - Sweet ride, Walden.\\
181 - Finally a car as pretty as you are.\\
182 - It'   s actually mine.\\
183 - There is no God.\\
184 - Alan, we talked about this.\\
185 - I thought you were gonna get something practical.\\
186 - I thought so, too.\\
187 - But Michael Caine is out of the country shooting a movie,\\
188 - so here we are.\\
189 - Couldn'   t you have talked some sense into him?\\
190 - I told him to get whatever he wants.\\
191 - Don'   t hate the genie, hate the wish.\\
192 - Right now I hate the idiot who wasted it on a Ferrari.\\
193 - Lyndsey, w-wait, wait. We can take it for a spin.\\
194 - I'   ll let you drive!\\
195 - Not a chance.\\
196 - What the hell? I really thought she was gonna like it.\\
197 - I know. Me, too.\\
198 - Hey, Berta, uh, if you had one wish, what would you get?\\
199 - Have you signed the divorce papers yet?\\
200 - I did. Then I'   m good.\\
201 -     Men.   \\
202 - Oh.\\
203 - Hey. Have you, uh, heard from Lyndsey?\\
204 - No.\\
205 - I even pulled out the big guns.\\
206 - I texted her a picture of my penis with a sad face on it.\\
207 - Why would that work on her\\
208 - when it never worked on me?\\
209 - [door opens]\\
210 - Hey, Walden.\\
211 - Alan, why did you send me your sad penis pic?\\
212 - I-I'   m sorry. That was for Lyndsey.\\
213 - Come on, man!\\
214 - Grow up. She'   s seen it in person.\\
215 - Yeah, and it was sad then, too.\\
216 - Yeah, well, that sad penis\\
217 - is driving around in a brand-new Ferrari.\\
218 - Why can'   t you talk like a person?\\
219 - Wait, so you used your wish on a Ferrari?\\
220 - And how did Lyndsey feel about that?\\
221 - Well, she hated it, and I just don'   t know why.\\
222 - I-It was like our anniversary lunch at Hooters all over again.\\
223 - Don'   t you know anything about women?\\
224 - Uh, you and I dated-- I think you know the answer to that.\\
225 - You had the chance to do something for you andLyndsey,\\
226 - and instead you did something just for yourself.\\
227 - WALDEN: You know what?\\
228 - This is my fault.\\
229 - I gave you too much power.\\
230 - You don'   t give a monkey a gun.\\
231 - Did we learn nothing from Planet of the Apes?\\
232 - So how do I make this right for Lyndsey?\\
233 - Oh. Maybe you could paint a smiley face on her vagina.\\
234 - If she had one wish, what would it be?\\
235 - To be married to him.\\
236 - Okay, that'   s probably true,\\
237 - but she can'   t have Walden. [chuckles]\\
238 - And make sure she knows that.\\
239 - But I think you might be on the right track\\
240 - that she would like a commitment.\\
241 - Wow... a commitment.\\
242 - [chuckles]\\
243 - For years, I-I felt I should marry Lyndsey,\\
244 - but, uh, it'   s never the right time.\\
245 - Maybe now is the right time.\\
246 - I just...\\
247 - wish I had the money for an engagement ring.\\
248 - I'   m not getting you an engagement ring and a Ferrari.\\
249 - How '   bout a promise ring and a Beemer?\\
250 -     Men.   \\
251 -     Men.   \\
252 - Wow. I'   ve never been\\
253 - to a high-end jewelry store like this.\\
254 - Really? Where'   d you get your engagement ring for your ex-wife?\\
255 - Well, when I met Judith, I was working at a funeral home.\\
256 - I'   ll let you figure out the rest.\\
257 - [clears throat]\\
258 - [lock buzzes]\\
259 - I don'   t think I belong here.\\
260 - You know, I-I feel out of place.\\
261 - Just follow my lead, and keep it classy.\\
262 - Hi. Welcome to BJ'   s.\\
263 - [muffled laughter]\\
264 - I'   m sorry.[both laugh]\\
265 - [laughing]: Um, what does "BJ" stand for?\\
266 - Bountiful Jewels.\\
267 - Oh. You know, I... I love your ads.\\
268 - Uh, uh, "Want a diamond, give a BJ."\\
269 - Uh, uh, how about this one?\\
270 - If you'   re gonna get down on your knees,\\
271 - you better be giving a BJ.\\
272 - [both laughing]\\
273 - We'   ve heard them all, sir.\\
274 - So, what can we do for you guys?\\
275 - Uh, well, to celebrate our divorce,\\
276 - I'   d like to get my ex-husband an engagement ring\\
277 - for his on-again, off-again girlfriend.\\
278 - Oh, and I might need your card, in case I propose\\
279 - to my girlfriend, his ex-girlfriend,\\
280 - our social worker.\\
281 - Also, do you validate?\\
282 - We do. So, what kind of cut\\
283 - were you thinking?\\
284 - Oh, well, a-a cushion cut is tr  sin vogue right now.\\
285 - Oh, on the other hand, ever since I was a little boy,\\
286 - I had my heart set on a princess cut.\\
287 - I think that she'   s asking what Lyndsey would like.\\
288 - Oh, uh, right, um, uh, the bride, uh, Lyndsey.\\
289 - Um, uh, well, you know, she has very common taste,\\
290 - so, you know, probably round.\\
291 - Well, what do you think of these?\\
292 - They are both a minimum of four carats each.\\
293 - Oh, and, uh, how much are they?\\
294 - Oh, dear Lord!\\
295 - I think I just dropped four carats in my pants.\\
296 - Don'   t worry about the price.\\
297 - Just get what you want.\\
298 - Wow. Lyndsey is very lucky\\
299 - to have a man like you in my life.\\
300 - So, do you see anything you like?\\
301 - They all look good under these showroom lights.\\
302 - I need something that looks good\\
303 - in a rent-controlled apartment in Van Nuys.\\
304 - Then I suggest this one.\\
305 - It'   s flawless.\\
306 - Oh. Well, I'   ll take it.\\
307 - It'   ll remind her of me.\\
308 - Why? Does the diamond fart a lot?\\
309 - I'   ll just go wrap this up.\\
310 - Wow. Wow! [laughs]\\
311 - It'   s really happening. Yeah.\\
312 - You'   re getting married.\\
313 - I know. I know.\\
314 - Pretty soon, I'   ll be moving out of the house.\\
315 - [laughs] I mean,\\
316 - I certainly wouldn'   t expect you\\
317 - to let Lyndsey and I live in your guest room.\\
318 - I mean, that'   -that'   d be ridiculous.\\
319 - [laughing]: Wouldn'   t it?\\
320 - [laughs]\\
321 - Wouldn'   t it?\\
322 - Hm... I have the house all to myself.\\
323 - I hadn'   t thought about that.\\
324 - ALL: Yay!\\
325 - Thank you.\\
326 - Well, we should do this more often.\\
327 - We never get together anymore.\\
328 - Oh, we wouldn'   t miss your 50th birthday,\\
329 - here in the year 2030.\\
330 - Why are you telling us what year it is?\\
331 - I don'   t know. I was just providing some context,\\
332 - in case people missed the subtitle.\\
333 - Well, I really appreciate you all being here.\\
334 - And, Louis, I'   m glad you could take time away from college.\\
335 - I wouldn'   t miss it, Dad.\\
336 - Although, today is the big game\\
337 - between Jupiter State and Moon University.\\
338 - Go... Craters!\\
339 - Wow. Things sure are different in the year 2030.\\
340 - Yeah. Lots of things are different.\\
341 - [sputters]\\
342 - BERTA: All right.\\
343 - I'   m out of here.What?!\\
344 - No. You'   re leaving?\\
345 - Yeah. I want to get home\\
346 - and watch the series finale of The Big Bang Theory.\\
347 - Matthew McConaughey is guest starring.\\
348 - I didn'   t know President McConaughey could act.\\
349 - We should really get going, too.Yeah.\\
350 - Oh, no! No. Come on, stay, guys. The-the...\\
351 - Wait, wait. Why don'   t you... why don'   t you stay the weekend?\\
352 - I'   ve have all these extra rooms.\\
353 - God, Walden, I am a successful businessman.\\
354 - I don'   t need to live in your house for free anymore.\\
355 - I live in Lyndsey'   s house for free now.\\
356 - Bye, guys. Happy birthday.\\
357 - Well, I guess it'   s just you and me.\\
358 - And Louis.\\
359 - WALDEN: Oh, yeah, but\\
360 - he'   s just a hologram.\\
361 - I'   ve got to go.\\
362 - [echoing]: It'   s pancake day in the cafeteria.\\
363 - Now it'   s really just you and me. Hmm.\\
364 - You want some cake?\\
365 - Hey, babe. Ready to go?\\
366 - I sure am.\\
367 - Rain check on the cake?\\
368 - How the hell did you not age?\\
369 - I'   m Michael Freakin'    Bolton.\\
370 - [laughs]\\
371 - And thanks for introducing us. Mm.\\
372 - Get out of my house, Bolton.\\
373 - Bye, Walden.\\
374 - Yeah, bye, Walden.\\
375 -     When a man steals a woman.\\
376 - Wait, no! No, no, no, don'   t leave!\\
377 - I don'   t want to be alone!\\
378 - I don'   t want to be alone.\\
379 - Oh, Walden, what-what are you talking about?\\
380 - No. You can'   t leave me.\\
381 - I'   ll give you anything you want.\\
382 - You can sleep in the master bedroom,\\
383 - and I'   ll sleep on the futon.\\
384 - Just, you can'   t marry Lyndsey!\\
385 - Wait... you can'   t ask that of me.\\
386 - I'   ll give you the house!\\
387 - What'   s your return policy?\\
388 - You can'   t give back a BJ.\\
389 - Oh, God... I'   m gonna die alone!\\
390 - Well, Walden, relax.\\
391 - No, I can'   t relax.\\
392 - I have seen the future!\\
393 - Ms. McMartin has beautiful new boobs,\\
394 - but I don'   t get the boobs.\\
395 - Bolton gets the boobs.\\
396 - And Louis-- he won'   t come home from Moon College!\\
397 - Oh, calm down. Calm down, Walden.\\
398 - Now, I want you to take a deep breath\\
399 - and tell me every detail about Ms. McMartin'   s boobs.\\
400 - I can'   t breathe.\\
401 - I need air.\\
402 - [high-pitched gasping]\\
403 - Everything is spinning!\\
404 - My whole world is coming apart!\\
405 - Could you please buzz me out?\\
406 - [lock buzzing]\\
407 -     Men.   \\
408 - Hey, hey, don'   t beat yourself up about this.\\
409 - I mean, everybody freaks out a little bit every now and then.\\
410 - I mean, it'   s like... it'   s like when I, uh, lost Louis\\
411 - for two hours at the mall.\\
412 - What?\\
413 - Uh, he found a Wetzel'   s Pretzel in the trash.\\
414 - It was fine.\\
415 - I'   m sorry I caused a scene back there.\\
416 - Everything hit me all at once,\\
417 - and I had this terrifying vision of the future,\\
418 - where I-I ended up all alone in this house.\\
419 - Terrifying? Next to my mother dying,\\
420 - being alone in this house is my favorite dream.\\
421 - Oh, it'   s just, when I think about the rest of my life,\\
422 - you'   re the one constant.\\
423 - And I know\\
424 - I joke a lot about you moving out,\\
425 - but the only thing... worse than...\\
426 - you staying is you leaving.\\
427 - Don'   t you think I'   m scared, too?\\
428 - I mean,\\
429 - I'   m trading you for someone ten years older\\
430 - and a billion dollars poorer.\\
431 - Don'   t put it that way in the proposal.\\
432 - Good call. See?\\
433 - I'   m always gonna need you.\\
434 - And look, it'   s not like I'   m leaving tomorrow.\\
435 - Plus, even after Lyndsey and I are married,\\
436 - we'   re still gonna see each other.\\
437 - You mean it?\\
438 - Of course.\\
439 - I gotta do something while Lyndsey'   s at work.\\
440 -     Men.   \\
441 - Thank you both for inviting me to dinner.\\
442 - Well, we just wanted to cheer you up.\\
443 - I'   m really fine. I'   m pretty used to Alan disappointing me.\\
444 - That'   s Alan. He disappoints us,\\
445 - then he redeems himself, only to disappoint us again.\\
446 - Yeah.\\
447 - It'   s the great circle of Alan.\\
448 - Hello, Lyndsey.\\
449 - Alan!\\
450 - Why are you dressed like the waiters?\\
451 - That'   s an unfortunate coincidence.\\
452 - I didn'   t know the restaurant was gonna be this nice.\\
453 - What'   s going on?\\
454 - Hold that thought until you hear this.\\
455 - Um, everybody, this is Scott.\\
456 - Uh, he is available for lessons\\

8 - Charlie Harper was the love of my life\\
9 - and a wonderful, wonderful man.\\
10 - He slipped on the Metro platform\\

64 - "Dear Mr. Harper:\\
65 - "We are holding unclaimed music royalties for you\\
66 - in the amount of $2.5 million."\\

68 - Looks like those children'   s records he made\\
69 - are still making money.\\
70 - Uh, say the number again.\\
71 - $2.5 million.\\
72 - [whimpers]\\
73 - Apparently, it'   s been stacking up since he died.\\
74 - Like the butt plugs.\\
75 - Alan, you do realize that money will go to his next of kin.\\
76 - Uh, yeah. That'   s me.\\
77 - Why do think I keep going... [whimpers]\\

92 - Yes, I-I am sorry, too.\\
93 - Uh, he'   s irreplaceable.\\
94 - Uh, anyway, um...\\
95 - I guess you can just, you know, send me the check and...\\
96 - Uh, death certificate?\\
97 - Uh, o-okay, uh, is that...\\
98 - is that necessary to get the money?\\
99 - Okay. Uh, how about, uh, you send me the check,\\
100 - I'   ll send you the death certificate?\\
101 - Or we can do it your way.\\
102 - Uh, uh, oh, oh,\\
103 - and by the way, um, uh, when you give me the money,\\
104 - do you notify the IRS, or is that my responsibility?\\
105 - Mine! Perfect.\\
106 - Uh, bye-bye.\\
107 - Our divorce is final, right?\\
108 - Alan, I neither want nor need your money.\\
109 - Oh, I know that, uh,\\
110 - but could you say that again on camera?\\
111 - O-Okay, okay.\\
112 - You don'   t have the death certificate, do you?\\
113 - No, but I'   m sure my mom does.\\
114 - How are you gonna get it from her\\
115 - without telling her about the money?\\
116 - Uh, remember four years ago\\
117 - how I told you I'   d only be here for a few days?\\
118 - I think I can figure it out.\\
119 - I can'   t wait for this to be over.\\
120 -     Men.   \\
121 - Well, this is a surprise.\\
122 - You visit so seldom.\\
123 - I know. I know.\\
124 - I need to do it more.\\
125 - I wasn'   t complaining.\\
126 - So, how have you been?\\
127 - Well, uh, uh, it'   s funny you should ask.\\
128 - Um, I'   ve been doing a lot of thinking lately.\\
129 - I'   m not giving you a penny.\\
130 - I, uh... I didn'   t come for money.\\
131 - Or a place to live or a car.\\
132 - Or affection or nurturing. I get it.\\
133 - Uh, uh, I was thinking.\\
134 - You know, um, well, maybe it'   s my age, but, uh,\\
135 - I'   m starting to reflect on the big questions.\\
136 - You know, what'   s... what'   s it all about?\\
137 - Uh, why are we here?\\
138 - What happens when we die?\\
139 - I know what happens when I die.\\
140 - You get nothing.\\
141 - Mom, I-I told you, I did not come here...\\
142 - Really? Nothing?\\
143 - It'   s not because I don'   t love you.\\
144 - I just don'   t want to give you a reason to kill me.\\
145 - You mean anotherreason.\\
146 - Where are all these morbid thoughts coming from?\\
147 - As long as I'   ve known you,\\
148 - you'   ve never been much of a thinker.\\
149 - Or a... a doer or a provider or...\\
150 - pretty much anything with "er" at the end.\\
151 - Maybe I'   ve been asking all these questions because\\
152 - the anniversary of Charlie'   s death is coming up.\\
153 - So? So I was thinking\\
154 - it might be nice to do something to commemorate it.\\
155 - Like what? Snort coke off a hooker'   s butt?\\
156 - Uh, actually, uh, uh, more like, uh,\\
157 - make a... a memorial collage.\\
158 - [laughs] A what?\\
159 - A... a memorial collage.\\
160 - You know, a collection of images celebrating his life.\\
161 - Uh, things like, uh, his birth certificate,\\
162 - uh, family pictures, death certificate,\\
163 - uh, awards, sheet music, diplomas,\\
164 - death certificate, um...\\
165 - I don'   t know how much I can help you.\\
166 - I-I'   ve got his birth certificate,\\
167 - a few baby pictures,\\
168 - the little hash pipe he made in camp.\\
169 - No death certificate?\\
170 - No.\\
171 - I-I just thought you had it.\\
172 - Oh. Well, bye.\\
173 -     Men.   \\
174 - I'   m sorry. I can'   t find any record of your brother'   s death.\\
175 - You sure? Uh, newspapers, obituaries?\\
176 - No, I checked everything on Charlie Harper--\\
177 - both here and in France-- and...\\
178 - I-I found a bunch of weird self-shot sex videos,\\
179 - including one featuring what appears to be\\
180 - the USC men'   s water polo team?\\
181 - I also found this crazy rant about a former employer.\\
182 - But there'   s nothing about his death.\\
183 - How is that possible?\\
184 - Did you ever see the body?\\
185 - There was no body. The man was hit by a train.\\
186 - All that was left was a...\\
187 - a meat smoothie and a couple of teeth.\\
188 - Well, how do you know he'   s really dead?\\
189 - Well, of course he'   s dead. I have his ashes.\\
190 - How do you know that they'   re his ashes?\\
191 - Well, what do you want me to do, test them for herpes?\\
192 -     Men.   \\
193 -     Twinkle, twinkle, little star    \\
194 -     I always know just where you are    \\
195 -     In a pit below my house\\
196 -     You will always be my spouse.    \\
197 - Oh, boy.\\
198 - [clicks tongue, sighs]\\
199 - Never put a window in a dungeon.\\
200 -     Men.   \\
201 -     Men.   \\
202 - Yes, I am calling about the $2.5 million\\
203 - in unclaimed royalties for Charlie Harper.\\
204 - Uh, uh, good news.\\
205 - Uh, I have just received\\
206 - the death certificate from France.\\
207 - Uh, it'   s in French and everything\\
208 - so you know it'   s real.\\
209 - Oh, oh, sure, I'   ll hold.\\
210 - Uh, "cause de d  c  s."\\

213 - Oh, yes, yes, I'   m still here.\\
214 - What?\\

218 - wearing a coat made of Dalmatians?\\
219 - What do you mean, you can'   t tell me?\\
220 - A... a numbered account in the Cayman Islands?\\
221 - That makes no sense.\\
222 - FedEx just dropped off a box addressed to Charlie.\\

244 - WALDEN: Well, it'   s not so much "how to,"\\
245 - as "how to do it better."\\
246 - Seriously?\\
247 - Hey. Even Tiger Woods needs a swing coach.\\
248 - Listen, can you\\
249 - just come back in, like, what, 20 minutes?\\
250 - Eh...\\
251 - No. This can'   t wait. Look at this text.\\
252 - [sighs]\\
253 - Okay, that can'   t be for you.\\
254 - You never pay for anything.\\
255 - I think, somehow, someway...\\
256 - [whispering]: Charlie is still alive.\\
257 - Okay, this is ridiculous.\\
258 - There'   s more. A package came addressed to him.\\
259 - Oh, is it something that vibrates?\\
260 - '   Cause I could really use some help with this.\\
261 - He ain'   t lying.\\
262 - No. It'   s-it'   s not sex toys.\\
263 - I am telling you, Charlie is coming back,\\
264 - and he is not happy with me.\\
265 - Well, at the moment, neither am I.\\
266 - Should I go?\\
267 - No, no, no, no, no. We'   re so close.\\
268 - Eh-eh...\\
269 - Walden, it'   s like you said.\\
270 - I mean, there was no proof that Charlie ever died.\\
271 - All we have is Rose'   s word.\\
272 - Who'   s Rose?\\
273 - Oh, she'   s this crazy millionairess\\
274 - that used to stalk Charlie, and then he married her.\\
275 - And then she started stalking me.\\
276 - Why? Did you sleep with her?\\
277 - Alan slept with her, too.\\
278 - Hey, after 12 years,\\
279 - everybody'   s slept with everybody.\\
280 - EVELYN: Alan! Alan, where are you?\\
281 - Uh, in here!\\
282 - Oh, for God sakes!\\
283 - That'   s my mother. Uh, oh, Walden slept with her, too.\\
284 - Uh... you slept with my mom!\\
285 - No, that was just a handy in a hotel bar.\\
286 - I am a gentleman.\\
287 - We need to talk.\\
288 - Oh. Who'   s this?\\
289 - Uh, this is my son'   s social worker, Ms. McMartin.\\

293 - I really should go.\\
294 - Yeah. Uh, okay.\\
295 - Just remember which step we'   re on.\\
296 - Number six:\\
297 - "finding the little man in the canoe."\\
298 - I don'   t remember you having any trouble...\\
299 - Okay, everybody stop!\\
300 - What are you doing here?\\
301 - I want to know why you sent me this hateful e-mail.\\
302 - Uh, "Dear Mom:\\
303 - "You were always a horrible mother\\
304 - "and a repulsive human being, and I hope you rot in hell.\\
305 - "But before you do,\\
306 - I will have my revenge."\\
307 - Okay, I don'   t disagree with anything here...\\
308 - ...but I did not send that.\\
309 - Really? Who else would call me "a horrible mother"?\\
310 - No, no, it'   s still ridiculous.\\
311 - What'   s ridiculous?\\
312 - Alan has this crazy idea\\
313 - that Charlie'   s still alive.\\
314 - But then who sent her that e-mail?\\
315 - Who sent me this text?\\
316 - Where did the cigars, booze and chasin'    knife come from?\\
317 - Wait, what'   s a chasin'    knife?\\
318 - Uh, it'   s a regular knife\\
319 - after two bottles of scotch and some blow.\\
320 - Who else would have sent it?\\
321 - I don'   t know.\\
322 - Like, somebody that wants to freak you out.\\
323 - Think about it: Who has something to gain from this?\\
324 - Who else has a claim on that money?\\
325 - What money?\\
326 - No money. There'   s no money.\\
327 - Alan, will you just tell her?\\
328 - [sighs]\\
329 - I don'   t want to.\\
330 - Alan!\\
331 - Turns out, uh, there are some unclaimed royalties,\\

333 - How much?\\
334 - Uh, two and a half... thousand dollars.\\
335 - Alan!\\
336 - Million.\\
337 - $2.5 million.\\
338 - Ah, the memorial collage.\\
339 - That'   s why you wanted the death certificate--\\
340 - so you could claim the money.\\
341 - You dirty rat bastard.\\
342 - What would you have done?\\
343 - We'   re wasting time here.\\
344 - Now, who else could have a claim on the money?\\

350 - Anyway, we were thinking of putting together\\
351 - a sort of memorial collage...\\
352 - For God'   s sakes, will you just tell her?\\
353 - Um, some money owed to your father has been discovered.\\
354 - Really? How much?\\
355 - Two and a half thousand.\\
356 - Million. It'   s $2.5 million.\\
357 - Why are you here?\\
358 - You know what? I'   ve been asking myself that since day one.\\
359 - Honestly, I forgot she was here.\\
360 - Look, anyway,\\
361 - somebody claimed it and transferred it\\
362 - into a numbered account in the Caymans.\\
363 - And you think it was me?\\
364 - Would I be living in a one-bedroom apartment\\
365 - if I had that kind of money?\\
366 - [door opens]\\

368 - Was that the same one or different?\\

380 - It'   s a cashier'   s check for $100,000.\\

40 - We went up on the Eiffel Tower...\\
41 - and went down on the Champs-E  lys  es.\\
42 - [zipper unzips, Charlie sighs]\\
43 - Ooh!\\
44 - Afterwards, we celebrated our love\\
45 - with a romantic candlelit dinner at the Ritz.\\
46 - [vacuum cleaner whirring]\\
47 - [sighs, sniffs]\\
48 - Of course, I'   ve always known Charlie was no saint,\\
49 - but I thought marriage would change him.\\
50 - Huh?\\
51 - I was wrong.\\
52 - So wrong.\\
53 - Huh?\\
54 - Disturbingly wrong.\\
55 - [bleats]\\
56 - I ran from the room, determined to never see him again.\\
57 - [bleating]: Charlie...\\
58 - He finally caught up with me at the train station,\\
59 - but all I could think about was...\\
60 - [train whistle blowing] revenge.\\
61 - But at the last second, fate intervened.\\
62 - So I booked us a cruise home.\\
63 - [muffled grunting]\\
64 - We moved into a brand-new house in Sherman Oaks--\\
65 - the good part, south of the boulevard--\\
66 - where we could live as a happy couple.\\
67 - WALDEN: Wait a minute.\\
68 - You bought a house with a dungeon?\\
69 - And a pit?\\
70 - Of course not.\\
71 - I had it remodeled.\\
72 - The permit process was just a nightmare.\\
73 - Next time, use my pit guy.\\
74 - He'   s the best.\\
75 - Continue.\\
76 - ROSE: For the next four years,\\
77 - we were the happiest we'   d ever been.\\
78 - I'   d feed him...\\
79 - bathe him...\\
80 - and, of course, there was endless\\
81 - magical lovemaking.\\
82 - Then, a few days ago, the unthinkable happened.\\
83 - Somehow, he managed to make a rope\\
84 - out of his bowling shirts and ran away,\\
85 - disappearing into the darkness.\\
86 - [cartoony music playing]\\
87 - Th-Th-Th-That'   s all, folks.\\
88 -     Men.   \\
89 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
90 -     Ah.     Men.     Men.\\
91 -     Men.   Charlie escaped?\\
92 - Uh, no. Prisoners escape.\\
93 - Lovers run away because they'   re afraid of commitment.\\
94 - Any-who, I just thought I should tell you.\\
95 - You know, in case he drops by and guts you all like fish.\\
96 - Why me? He doesn'   t even know me.\\
97 - Oh, I told him all about you--\\
98 - how you'   re richer than him, prettier than him,\\
99 - and moved into his house and carried on\\
100 - like he never existed.\\
101 - Thank you.\\
102 - Hold on, Rose.\\
103 - If Charlie is alive, who'   s in the urn?\\
104 - Oh. That'   s Billy.\\
105 - Who'   s Billy?\\
106 - The bisexual goat\\
107 - who gave his life that your son might live.\\
108 - So... so, what are we supposed to do now?\\
109 - Wait a second.\\
110 - Are we really not gonna talk about the fact\\
111 - that Charlie was having sex with a goat?\\
112 - Well, you didn'   t know Charlie.\\
113 - It would have been weirder if he hadn'   t.\\
114 - Well, now that you'   re all caught up,\\
115 - I'   ll say my good-byes.\\
116 - You'   re leaving?\\
117 - Yeah. I'   m not gonna stick around to find out\\
118 - what he'   s going to do to me just because I loved him too much.\\
119 - Toodles.\\
120 - Nah. That'   s just stupid.\\
121 - No... no, no, no, no, this is ridiculous.\\
122 - He'   s not gonna hurt anybody.\\
123 - Oh, of course not.\\
124 - Rose, wait up!\\
125 - What, you'   re leaving, too?\\
126 - Alan, your brother wasn'   t very pleasant\\
127 - if he missed his morning coffee.\\
128 - How do you think he'   s going to be\\
129 - after four years in a pit?\\
130 - So you'   re just gonna bail?\\
131 - Uh... yep.\\
132 - Berta, good-bye.\\
133 - I never really cared for you.\\
134 - Right back at you, Red.\\
135 - Walden...\\
136 - I loved you like a son.\\
137 - Alan...\\
138 - good luck.\\
139 - Well, I-I guess we should go, too.\\
140 - Hold on!\\
141 - We'   re not really gonna run\\
142 - '   cause of some crazy woman'   s story\\
143 - and some vague text threats.\\
144 - [cell phone chimes]\\
145 - Okay, this one'   s a little more specific.\\
146 - What does it say?\\
147 - "You despicable troll.\\
148 - "You thought you could replace my ninja awesomeness,\\
149 - "you lame clown?\\
150 - "I will deploy my army of assassins to destroy you.\\
151 - "I will bring my bayonets of truth\\
152 - "to the hexagon of death,\\
153 - "where I will carve my initials into your reptilian skull\\
154 - and cover you in tiger'   s blood."\\
155 - Hard to believe he wrote children'   s songs, isn'   t it?\\
156 - Yeah, we'   re gonna need some help.\\
157 - Yeah, we'   re gonna need a lot of help.\\
158 - Here, try these.\\
159 - They won'   t keep him from hurting you,\\
160 - but they will keep you from feeling it.\\
161 -     Men.   \\
162 - Uh, thank you for meeting with us\\
163 - on such short notice, Lieutenant.\\
164 - [Austrian accent]: Anything for you, my friend.\\
165 - How can I help?\\
166 -     Men.   \\
167 -     Men.   So, uh, that'   s about it,\\
168 - uh, uh, Lieutenant...\\
169 - Wagner.Uh, Wagner.\\
170 - No, not Wagner; Wagner.\\
171 - Uh, W-A-G-N-E-R. Wagner.\\
172 - "Vhatever."\\
173 - All right, now, let me see if I got this straight.\\
174 - 12 years ago, your wife kicked you out,\\
175 - and then you and your dumb son moved in with your brother.\\
176 - Uh, uh, he wasn'   t dumb at the beginning.\\
177 - Uh, he got dumb later on.\\
178 - What happened?\\
179 - Uh, well, turned out it was funnier.\\
180 - All right.\\
181 - So your brother then let you stay there\\
182 - eight and a half years rent-free,\\
183 - even though you claim that he never liked you.\\
184 - Ah. Ah, you'   re not the only one to point out the illogic.\\
185 - And this brother of yours supposedly died in Paris\\
186 - under mysterious circumstances.\\
187 - It wasn'   t all that mysterious.\\
188 - I mean, he was taking a lot of drugs\\
189 - and pissed off almost everybody.\\
190 - And then you tried to drown yourself,\\
191 - but you changed your mind because the water was too cold.\\
192 - And then you got into his house and offered to buy it.\\
193 - It seemed like a good idea at the time.\\
194 - And then you let him and his son stay there for four more years.\\
195 - Right.\\
196 - Rent-free.\\
197 - Well, when you say it like that,\\
198 - it sounds ridiculous.\\
199 - And then your dead brother'   s\\
200 - previously unknown lesbian daughter shows up,\\
201 - and then you let her move in.\\
202 - [chuckles] You can'   t write this stuff, huh?\\
203 - And then the two of you got married to each other.\\
204 - Yes.\\
205 - But you'   re not gay.\\
206 - Well, I'   m not.\\
207 - And then you adopted a black child.\\
208 - Ah, ah, he'   s, uh... he'   s more Eurasian.\\
209 - Uh...\\
210 - Oh, what a sweetie pie.\\
211 - And the two of you are now divorced?\\
212 - Mmm.But you'   re living together.\\
213 - If I leave, the whole thing falls apart.\\
214 - Yeah, of course.\\
215 - Uh, and now the woman who stalked your brother\\
216 - and then married him\\
217 - all of a sudden shows up and she says\\
218 - that he'   s not dead after all, that she has been keeping him\\
219 - in a dungeon pit in the San Fernando Valley.\\
220 - Ah, uh, Sherman Oaks.\\
221 - Uh, but the good part-- uh, south of the boulevard.\\
222 - And then he escaped,\\
223 - and he sent you cigars and whiskey.\\
224 - Oh, and don'   t forget the chasin'    knife.\\
225 - Oh, and the threatening text.\\
226 - He said, uh, "I'   m coming home,\\
227 - and you'   re gonna pay."\\
228 - I'   m confused.\\
229 - '   Cause you said he doesn'   t pay for anything.\\
230 - I think the point is,\\
231 - is that we need you to find him becau...\\
232 - This guy has some serious rage issues.\\
233 - Has he tried anger management?\\
234 - Yeah, but it didn'   t work.\\
235 - Okay.\\
236 - Well, I have this inscription now,\\
237 - and so if we find him, I'   ll let you know.\\
238 - Uh, well... Thank you.\\
239 - Uh, really appreciate it.\\
240 - No problem.\\
241 - Now, if I can, uh,\\
242 - offer you a word of advice...\\
243 - Mm-hmm?\\
244 - I would consider wrapping this whole thing up.\\
245 - Uh, what do you mean?\\
246 - I mean the whole living arrangement.\\
247 - The kids, the girls, the beach house.\\
248 - I mean, this whole thing has been going on way too long.\\
249 - Yeah, a lot of people been saying that.\\
250 - Haters gonna hate.\\
251 -     Men.   \\
252 - We should get out of town for a couple of days.\\
253 - You know, go to a nice resort,\\
254 - uh, get some facials, mani-pedis.\\
255 - You know, a guys'    weekend.\\
256 - No... we'   re not going anywhere.\\
257 - We got a state-of-the-art security system.\\
258 - Nobody gets in unless we let them in.\\
259 - [both screaming]\\
260 - What the hell?!\\
261 - "We got a state-of-the-art security system.\\
262 - No one gets in unless we let them in."\\
263 - Shut up.No, you shut up.\\
264 - Hey. [both scream]\\
265 - Jake? Oh, my God. Oh, my God!\\
266 - Oh, my God.\\
267 - [laughing]\\
268 - Hey!\\
269 - What are you doing here?\\
270 - Yeah, I thought you were in the Army.\\
271 - Come on. Look at me.\\
272 - Do I look like someone who'   s in the Army?\\
273 - Not on our side.\\
274 - Come in.\\
275 - Hey. These are pretty cool. Where'   d you get them? Target?\\
276 - [laughs]\\
277 - You get it? '   Cause of the... there'   s the circles...\\
278 - Yeah, no, no, I got it. I got it. No.\\
279 - Here'   s the thing.\\
280 - It turns out that your Uncle Charlie\\
281 - might still be alive.\\
282 - Oh.\\
283 - That would explain why I got a check for $250,000\\
284 - and a note that said, "I'   m alive."\\
285 - You have $250,000?\\
286 - Not anymore. I stopped in in Vegas on the way here.\\
287 - Oh, God. How much do you have left?\\
288 - Two and a half million.\\
289 - [whimpers]\\
290 - Oh!\\
291 - You won $2.5 million?\\
292 - Oh, yeah. It'   s not that hard.\\
293 - I kept playing craps because, you know, "crap."\\
294 - Oh, and I kept betting on come, because...\\

296 - Wow. That'   s... amazing that you made so much money\\
297 - with such stupid jokes.\\

305 - No idea.\\
306 - By the way, you'   re out of pot.\\
