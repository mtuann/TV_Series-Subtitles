1 - So, what do you think?\\
2 - Wow.\\
3 - It's for you, right?\\
4 - It's for both of us.\\
5 - Don't go away.\\
6 - Don't worry.\\
7 - There's no enough blood left in my legs to go anywhere.\\
8 - ( phone ringing )\\
9 - CHARLIE ( on machine ): Hey, it's Charlie.\\
10 - Do your thing when you hear the beep.\\
11 - ( beeps )\\
12 - WOMAN: Listen, you lousy SOB.\\
13 - I will not be treated like this.\\
14 - Either you call me or you are going to be very, very sorry.\\
15 - I love you, Monkey Man.\\
16 - Charlie?\\
17 - Who is that?\\
18 - Damn telemarketers.\\
19 - A telemarketer who calls you "Monkey Man."\\
20 - I'm on some weird list.\\
21 - Okay, it's a woman I went out with once,\\
22 - and she got a little clingy.\\
23 - You are a bad, bad boy.\\
24 - And yet, you're always the one getting spanked.\\
25 - ( phone rings )\\
26 - Geez.\\
27 - CHARLIE ( on machine ): Hey, it's Charlie.\\
28 - Do your thing when you hear the beep.\\
29 - ( beeps )\\
30 - MAN: Uh, Charlie, it-it's Alan,\\
31 - uh, your brother.\\
32 - No big deal.\\
33 - Uh, just wanted to touch base.\\
34 - My-my wife threw me out\\
35 - and I'm kind of losing the will to live.\\
36 - So, when you get a chance,\\
37 - I'd really love to, oh, I don't know...\\
38 - Hey, Alan, I'm sorry to hear about that.\\
39 - Uh, so, where are you going to go, to a hotel?\\
40 - Wow.\\
41 - Huh?\\
42 - Well, yeah, I-I guess you could... stay here.\\
43 - Okay.\\
44 - I'll see you when you get here.\\
45 - We better hurry.\\
46 - Oh, is she staying over?\\
47 - 'Cause I may have parked behind her.\\
48 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men *\\
49 - Twelve years and-and she just throws me out.\\
50 - I mean, what was the point of our wedding vows?\\
51 - You know, "Till death do us part."\\
52 - Who died? Not me, not her.\\
53 - How did you get in my house?\\
54 - Okay, Charlie, the key in the fake rock only works\\
55 - if it's among other rocks.\\
56 - Not-not sitting on your welcome mat.\\
57 - Excuse me,\\
58 - but if you put the fake rock in with a bunch of other rocks,\\
59 - it's impossible to find when you're drunk.\\
60 - You know, I'm a good husband.\\
61 - I-I'm faithful.\\
62 - Is she?\\
63 - Is she what?\\
64 - Faithful.\\
65 - ( scoffing )\\
66 - Don't be ridiculous.\\
67 - I mean, Judith doesn't even like sex.\\
68 - I mean, all she kept saying\\
69 - was she feels suffocated, you know.\\
70 - She kept going on and on,\\
71 - "I'm suffocating. I'm suffocating."\\
72 - What does that mean?\\
73 - Has a women ever said that to you?\\
74 - Well, yeah...\\
75 - but not a woman who doesn't like sex.\\
76 - And-And Jake.\\
77 - Jake?\\
78 - My son.\\
79 - Oh, yeah, teenagers are pretty sophisticated these days.\\
80 - He's ten.\\
81 - WOMAN: Charlie, I'm going to go.\\
82 - CHARLIE: Oh, no.\\
83 - You two need to talk. I'll call you tomorrow.\\
84 - I'm sorry to hear about you and your wife.\\
85 - Oh, come on, you leaving\\
86 - isn't going to bring them back together again.\\
87 - Look, okay, this is just until things settle out.\\
88 - A couple of days max.\\
89 - She will come to her senses.\\
90 - Yeah, that's what women do.\\
91 - Look, you can have the guest room.\\
92 - I'll grab some sheets.\\
93 - That's okay.\\
94 - I brought my own.\\
95 - Brought your own sheets?\\
96 - I like my sheets.\\
97 - Okay, then, good night.\\
98 - No, no, wait, wait.\\
99 - Charlie, I mean,\\
100 - we hardly ever talk to each other.\\
101 - ( sighs ): What do you want to talk about, Alan?\\
102 - I don't know. Uh...\\
103 - I was named Chiropractor of the Year\\
104 - by the San Fernando Valley Chiropractic Association.\\
105 - Okay, then, good night.\\
106 - No...\\
107 - No, Charlie, Charlie, what about you?\\
108 - What's, uh, what's going on with you?\\
109 - Well, Alan, there's not much to say.\\
110 - I make a lot of money for doing very little work.\\
111 - I sleep with beautiful women who don't ask about my feelings.\\
112 - I drive a Jag, I live at the beach,\\
113 - and sometimes, in the middle of the day,\\
114 - for no reason at all,\\
115 - I like to make myself a big pitcher of margaritas,\\
116 - take a nap out on the sundeck.\\
117 - Huh.\\
118 - Okay, then, good night, Charlie. Good night.\\
119 - Good night, Monkey Man.\\
120 - Boy, is your eye red.\\
121 - You should see it from in here.\\
122 - What are you doing here, Jake?\\
123 - My mom brought me.\\
124 - Will you take me swimming in the ocean?\\
125 - ( sighs ): Can we talk about it after my head stops exploding?\\
126 - Why is your head exploding?\\
127 - Well, I drank a little too much wine last night.\\
128 - If it makes you feel bad, why do you drink it?\\
129 - Nobody likes a wiseass, Jake.\\
130 - You have to put a dollar in the swear jar.\\
131 - You said "ass."\\
132 - Tell you what... here's 20.\\
133 - That should cover me till lunch.\\
134 - Now, what I think you need to do\\
135 - is to make a list.\\
136 - On one side, put what you don't like about our marriage,\\
137 - and on the other side, what you do.\\
138 - Alan, sometimes when I think about coming home to you,\\
139 - I start crying in my car.\\
140 - Okay, that would probably go on the "don't" side.\\
141 - Why would I lie?\\
142 - The ocean is closed today.\\
143 - For God's sake, Charlie,\\
144 - do you think you could put some pants on?\\
145 - Look at me, Judy.\\
146 - I could barely make it down the stairs.\\
147 - Uh, Charlie, could you and Jake, uh...\\
148 - Yeah. Come on, kid.\\
149 - We'll have breakfast out on the deck.\\
150 - I already had breakfast.\\
151 - Okay, we'll have lunch.\\
152 - Not lunchtime.\\
153 - ( imitates explosion )\\
154 - That's his head exploding.\\
155 - Judith, I-I can change.\\
156 - Oh, please, Alan.\\
157 - You are the most rigid, inflexible, obsessive,\\
158 - anal-retentive man I've ever met.\\
159 - Rigid and inflexible?\\
160 - Don't you think that's a little... redundant?\\
161 - My mom and dad are splitting up.\\
162 - Yeah, looks that way.\\
163 - You're lucky.\\
164 - When I was your age,\\
165 - Your mom is my grandma.\\
166 - Yup.\\
167 - Grandma says you're a bitter disappointment.\\
168 - Hey, sport.\\
169 - Uh, your mom wants to say good-bye.\\
170 - Uh, listen,\\
171 - he doesn't know anything about what's going on\\
172 - so let's just keep this to ourselves.\\
173 - Our little secret.\\
174 - Wh-Why is she saying good-bye to him?\\
175 - Oh, well, she's going to be spending the weekend\\
176 - with her sister... in Vegas.\\
177 - uh, so, we decided that Jake would stay with me.\\
178 - With you?\\
179 - Well, with us.\\
180 - I'm hungry.\\
181 - Is this going to be a problem?\\
182 - I guess not.\\
183 - Thanks. Oh, uh, hey, listen.\\
184 - I've got to call my office.\\
185 - Would you mind making him lunch?\\
186 - Sure.\\
187 - Thanks.\\
188 - What are you smiling about?\\
189 - You don't have any food.\\
190 - Yeah, but I'm not the one who's hungry.\\
191 - Who's smiling now, shorty?\\
192 - CHARLIE: You drink milk?\\
193 - Just with cereal.\\
194 - Okay.\\
195 - Not that milk.\\
196 - That milk.\\
197 - What's the difference?\\
198 - That's DairyFarm.\\
199 - We drink DairyBarn.\\
200 - Fine.\\
201 - Happy?\\
202 - Why would I be happy?\\
203 - It's just milk.\\
204 - Cute.\\
205 - Keep it up, you'll be on one of the cartons.\\
206 - Okay, cereal.\\
207 - We got Lucky Charms, Cocoa Puffs,\\
208 - Frosted Flakes, Maple Loops...\\
209 - I want Maple Loops.\\
210 - * It's got oats and corns and wheat *\\
211 - * It's the sweetest breakfast treat *\\
212 - BOTH: * It's maple, maple, ma... ple-icious! *\\
213 - You know who wrote that song?\\
214 - Your Uncle Charlie wrote that.\\
215 - No lie?\\
216 - Kid, if I was going to lie,\\
217 - I'd say I wrote "Stairway to Heaven"\\
218 - not "The Maple Loop Song."\\
219 - You two are really good together.\\
220 - Thank you.\\
221 - So, does your wife sing, too?\\
222 - Oh, uh, no.\\
223 - I'm not married.\\
224 - Oh. What a shame.\\
225 - Wow...\\
226 - you're even better than a dog.\\
227 - Dr. Bloom. Yes, yes.\\
228 - This is, uh, Alan Harper.\\
229 - Yes. My wife and I need\\
230 - to cancel our marriage counseling appointment\\
231 - for this afternoon.\\
232 - Yes, well, well, something came up.\\
233 - Well, it's-it's-it's kind of personal.\\
234 - I mean, I-I-I...\\
235 - Well, yeah, I know the point of these things is...\\
236 - I've got to go.\\
237 - Um, hello?\\
238 - Is Charlie home?\\
239 - Uh, uh, no. I'm, uh, I'm Charlie's brother.\\
240 - Can I, uh, can I help you?\\
241 - Oh, hi, Charlie's brother.\\
242 - I'm Rose.\\
243 - I'm Charlie's housekeeper.\\
244 - So you're-you're a housekeeper?\\
245 - Well, housekeeper, slash, actress, slash, hand model.\\
246 - ( laughs )\\
247 - I just do this to keep the wolf from the door.\\
248 - ( roars )\\
249 - ( laughs )\\
250 - You know what I mean?\\
251 - Sure. Sure, come on in. Uh...\\
252 - Oh.\\
253 - Yeah, I can smell him.\\
254 - Smell who?\\
255 - Your brother.\\
256 - He has a very musky scent.\\
257 - Uh-huh.\\
258 - Well, I'll just, uh... let you get to work.\\
259 - Oh, wait.\\
260 - Oh, no. It's okay.\\
261 - * It's got oats and corns and wheat *\\
262 - * It's the sweetest breakfast treat *\\
263 - * It's maple, maple, maa....\\
264 - Jake, buddy, take a break.\\
265 - ALAN: What, uh...\\
266 - What took you so long?\\
267 - We stopped for ice cream 'cause I'm a babe magnet.\\
268 - I got to take a squirt.\\
269 - Why do you assume he learned that from me?\\
270 - Because I learned it from you.\\
271 - Hey, thanks for cleaning up.\\
272 - Oh, it wasn't me.\\
273 - Rose was here.\\
274 - Rose?\\
275 - You let Rose into my house?\\
276 - She said she was your maid.\\
277 - What the hell.\\
278 - She glued the damned cabinets shut again.\\
279 - Again? You've got somebody\\
280 - who comes in regularly to glue your cabinets?\\
281 - Oh, you've met some of the whack jobs\\
282 - I've gone out with.\\
283 - It's not that big a stretch.\\
284 - Oh, oh. So this is my fault.\\
285 - Who let her in?\\
286 - Oh, you are a deeply disturbed man.\\
287 - Oh, I'm deeply disturbed?\\
288 - Who showed up here in the middle of the night\\
289 - with his own sheets?\\
290 - Hey, at least I care what I sleep on,\\
291 - or should I say, who I sleep on.\\
292 - Hey, pal, of the two of us,\\
293 - I'll bet I'm the only one\\
294 - who slept with a married woman recently.\\
295 - EVELYN: And isn't that something\\
296 - to brag about?\\
297 - ( thudding )\\
298 - Hi, Mom.\\
299 - EVELYN: Do you have any idea how hurtful it is\\
300 - to hear about your own son's divorce\\
301 - on the street?\\
302 - What divorce?\\
303 - Wh-what street?\\
304 - How did you get in my house?\\
305 - You stay out of this.\\
306 - I'm here to help your brother through a very difficult time.\\
307 - How could you do this to me?\\
308 - Do what?\\
309 - Now when I want to see my grandson,\\
310 - I am going to have to make an appointment\\
311 - with Judith,\\
312 - who-- let's face it-- was never very warm to me.\\
313 - And what if there's another man there,\\
314 - shacking up with her?\\
315 - Have you even stopped to consider that?\\
316 - I think he's considering it now, Mom.\\
317 - Here's your iced tea, Grandma.\\
318 - Oh, thank you, my little angel.\\
319 - Oh, darling, I asked for a lemon wedge.\\
320 - All right, here's what you're going to do.\\
321 - You and Jake will come live with me.\\
322 - After all, I'm just\\
323 - rattling around in that big house all by myself.\\
324 - Mom, that's very considerate,\\
325 - but as soon as Judith and I work things out,\\
326 - I'm going to be back at my own house.\\
327 - Oh, sweetheart, grow up.\\
328 - Think about what I said.\\
329 - You're my son, and I'll always have room for you in my house\\
330 - and in my heart.\\
331 - I-I love you, too, Mom.\\
332 - I love you, too, Mom.\\
333 - Too little. Too late.\\
334 - So, Vegas was good?\\
335 - It was fine.\\
336 - Alan, I really want to apologize\\
337 - for putting you through this.\\
338 - I was wrong to blame you for my unhappiness.\\
339 - No. No need to apologize.\\
340 - What's important is that we're here,\\
341 - and we're working on our marriage.\\
342 - You look great, by the way.\\
343 - Must be all the\\
344 - extra oxygen they pump into the casinos.\\
345 - Alan... And-and-and-and you were right.\\
346 - I-I see now that the time apart did us both a lot of good.\\
347 - I know I've grown.\\
348 - I am not that suffocating guy\\
349 - you threw out of the house four and half days ago.\\
350 - Let me tell you that.\\
351 - Alan... And Jake's doing fine.\\
352 - I know you were concerned\\
353 - about him being around my brother,\\
354 - but it turns out Charlie's great with kids.\\
355 - All right, last card, down and dirty.\\
356 - Kings bet.\\
357 - Dollar.\\
358 - I'm in.\\
359 - In.\\
360 - I'll see the dollar\\
361 - and raise it five.\\
362 - You raised $5 on that?\\
363 - I call.\\
364 - Call. Call.\\
365 - Call.\\
366 - Queens full of nines.\\
367 - ( groans )\\
368 - Hey, kid, don't you know what a full house is?\\
369 - Yeah, and I also know what a psych-out is.\\
370 - CHARLIE: I love this boy.\\
371 - And-and-and I think\\
372 - that we're going to look back on this\\
373 - as-as a new beginning\\
374 - for our marriage,\\
375 - a rebirth, a Renaissance, if you will.\\
376 - Alan, I think I'm gay.\\
377 - All right.\\
378 - We'll make a list.\\
379 - On one side, we'll put gay stuff...\\
380 - I'll see you...\\
381 - and raise you 20.\\
382 - I think he's got you, pal.\\
383 - He's bluffing.\\
384 - He always pulls his ear when he bluffs.\\
385 - How about it, Mighty Mouse?\\
386 - You in?\\
387 - Take him down.\\
388 - Call you.\\
389 - I hate this kid.\\
390 - What the hell is going on here?\\
391 - You said "hell."\\
392 - Throw a dollar in the pot.\\
393 - What?\\
394 - Hey, we all had to.\\
395 - Charlie, may I speak with you privately, please?\\
396 - Whose deal is it?\\
397 - ALAN: Jake, go to bed!\\
398 - I'm out.\\
399 - What is wrong with you?\\
400 - Are you insane?\\
401 - Do you have any sense of right and wrong?\\
402 - Probably not. How was dinner?\\
403 - How could you put Jake in a poker game with grown men?\\
404 - I obviously can't be trusted.\\
405 - So, how was dinner?\\
406 - I leave you alone with him\\
407 - for a couple of hours. I mean, it's just...\\
408 - I'm just going to keep asking, Alan.\\
409 - Dinner was swell.\\
410 - We both had the veal piccata, and she's gay.\\
411 - Wow.\\
412 - Most chicks won't eat veal.\\
413 - Why do I even try talking to you?\\
414 - Oh, come on.\\
415 - I'm just trying to get you to lighten up a little.\\
416 - I don't need to lighten up.\\
417 - The world I live in is dark.\\
418 - Dark and rainy.\\
419 - And you're useless in it.\\
420 - Oh, really?\\
421 - I wasn't useless when you needed a place to stay.\\
422 - Well, obviously, that was a mistake.\\
423 - Are you sure?\\
424 - Maybe we should make a list.\\
425 - ( playing soft blues on piano )\\
426 - Uncle Charlie?\\
427 - What's going on?\\
428 - Can't sleep?\\
429 - No.\\
430 - My dad says we're moving to Grandma's tomorrow.\\
431 - Yeah. That'd keep me up.\\
432 - You know, if it makes you feel any better,\\
433 - you won 80 bucks in that last hand.\\
434 - 85.\\
435 - 80. House gets a cut.\\
436 - I wish my dad was as cool as you.\\
437 - Hey, don't sell your dad short.\\
438 - He loves you more than anything in the world.\\
439 - You know that, don't you?\\
440 - I guess.\\
441 - How come you don't have any kids?\\
442 - I don't know.\\
443 - Maybe because I love me more than anything in the world.\\
444 - Uncle Charlie?\\
445 - Yeah?\\
446 - I don't want to go to Grandma's.\\
447 - I'd rather stay here.\\
448 - Yeah, well, your dad knows what's best for you.\\
449 - Okay.\\
450 - Good night, Uncle Charlie.\\
451 - I love you.\\
452 - Yeah.\\
453 - Okay.\\
454 - ( kissing )\\
455 - You got to love a kid like that.\\
456 - I even played him "Stairway to Heaven,"\\
457 - and he still liked the Maple Loops song better.\\
458 - Oh. Charlie,\\
459 - I haven't seen you in two weeks.\\
460 - Now, do you want to talk about your nephew,\\
461 - or do you want to have sex?\\
462 - Oh, sex.\\
463 - Definitely sex.\\
464 - Let me ask you something.\\
465 - Yeah?\\
466 - Do you ever think about having kids?\\
467 - Whoa, Charlie, we got a good thing going.\\
468 - Can't we just leave it at that?\\
469 - What are you doing?\\
470 - I thought we were going to have sex.\\
471 - How am I supposed to have sex\\
472 - while your biological clock is going off?\\
473 - ( phone rings )\\
474 - Hey, it's Charlie.\\
475 - Do your thing when you hear the beep.\\
476 - ( beep )\\
477 - ROSE: Hi, Monkey Man.\\
478 - I was just thinking about you\\
479 - and wondering why we hurt each other so much.\\
480 - Rose, it's me,\\
481 - Monkey Man.\\
482 - Charlie?\\
483 - Yeah. Hey, listen, let me ask you a question.\\
484 - Is there something inherently wrong\\
485 - with asking a woman you're involved with\\
486 - if she wants kids?\\
487 - Oh, Charlie.\\
488 - We got a good thing going.\\
489 - Why do you want to mess it up?\\
490 - ( line disconnects )\\
491 - Look at you.\\
492 - All grown up\\
493 - and back living with Mom.\\
494 - How good do you feel about yourself right now?\\
495 - On a scale of one to two.\\
496 - I'm not back living with Mom.\\
497 - I'm simply staying here\\
498 - till Judith and I work things out.\\
499 - So... one?\\
500 - What do you want, Charlie?\\
501 - Well, I figured you been here a couple of weeks.\\
502 - You got to have blood in your stool by now.\\
503 - So I thought if you and Jake wanted to come back\\
504 - to my place for a while, that that'd be okay.\\
505 - Wait a minute. Are you saying\\
506 - you want me to come back and live with you?\\
507 - Well, truthfully, no.\\
508 - I want Jake to come back and live with me,\\
509 - but I figure, you're a package deal.\\
510 - Thanks, but we're doing just fine here with Mom.\\
511 - Oh, come on, Alan.\\
512 - We can't let Jake be exposed to her\\
513 - on any kind of ongoing basis.\\
514 - There's no ongoing basis.\\
515 - He's only here on weekends.\\
516 - That's too much.\\
517 - Piranhas can strip an entire cow in an hour.\\
518 - Alan, we've got to get him away from her.\\
519 - I mean, look what happened to us.\\
520 - And what happened to you?\\
521 - Hi, Mom.\\
522 - Charlie, you're a grown man.\\
523 - Perhaps it's time to stop blaming your mother\\
524 - for your own shortcomings.\\
525 - Alan, the divan is not for sitting.\\
526 - Charlie,\\
527 - get off the couch.\\
528 - Uncle Charlie!\\
529 - Oh, there's my\\
530 - good boy.\\
531 - And what did I tell you\\
532 - about yelling in the house?\\
533 - Grandma, I'm suffocating.\\
534 - ( laughs )\\
535 - Sound familiar?\\
536 - You're right.\\
537 - This madness must end.\\
538 - Here, I got you your own key.\\
539 - * Men.\\
540 - I am not comfortable with this.\\
541 - I mean, maybe I should go wait in the car.\\
542 - You're not waiting in the car.\\
543 - Trust me. This is a great way to meet women.\\
544 - I don't want to meet women.\\
545 - I'm still married. Oh, come on.\\
546 - You're wife's out meeting chicks.\\
547 - Why shouldn't you?\\

549 - * It's the sweetest breakfast treat *\\
550 - * It's maple, maple, ma... ple-icious! *\\
551 - Your son is just adorable.\\
552 - Oh, thank you.\\
553 - You and your...\\
554 - life partner must be so proud.\\
555 - You're right.\\
556 - Go wait in the car.
\subsection {Episode 02: Big Flappy Bastards}
1 - Oh, okay.\\
2 - Here's one of the first things your Uncle Charlie wrote.\\
3 - ( plays piano )\\
4 - * Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles... *\\
5 - Eh? What do you think?\\
6 - Must have been before my time.\\
7 - Okay, we're done here.\\
8 - Hey, hey, hey.\\
9 - Don't put your juice box on the piano.\\
10 - It leaves a ring.\\
11 - How could a box leave a ring?\\
12 - Got to run to the grocery store.\\
13 - I'm going to need somebody to fold these clothes.\\
14 - I don't know if the grocery store\\
15 - is the first place I'd go for that, but good luck.\\
16 - Oh, oh, remember.\\
17 - You're being punished.\\
18 - So no TV, no computer, no Gameboy.\\
19 - Charlie, I need you to be my eyes and ears.\\
20 - Okay, but you have to be my liver and prostate.\\
21 - Whoa, whose is this?\\
22 - Uh, Charlie, you want to field that one?\\
23 - No problem.\\
24 - Jake, sometimes when you have a casual, sexual relationship...\\
25 - All right, all right.\\
26 - Jake, we take in strangers' laundry\\
27 - because we're poor.\\
28 - I'll be back in an hour.\\
29 - Start folding. No TV.\\
30 - What'd you get busted for?\\
31 - Painted my room at Mom's house.\\
32 - What's wrong with that?\\
33 - I'm ten years old.\\
34 - Hey, how about a little sock golf?\\
35 - What's that?\\
36 - Okay, here's how it works.\\
37 - The living room is a dog leg par four.\\
38 - That means you have to get your sock into the kitchen sink\\
39 - in four strokes or less.\\
40 - Okay.\\
41 - Play for a quarter a hole.\\
42 - Your handicap's obvious.\\
43 - You're short and you've never heard of the Ninja Turtles.\\
44 - All right,\\
45 - keep your knees bent, your arms straight\\
46 - and swing easy.\\
47 - Oh, man.\\
48 - I'm being hustled.\\
49 - We can play for less if you want.\\
50 - Don't get cocky.\\
51 - There's 17 more holes.\\
52 - ( British accent ): The 18th hole.\\
53 - All square.\\
54 - The defending champion\\
55 - looks to have an easy tap in for a birdie,\\
56 - as the gallery waits breathlessly\\
57 - for the rookie to respond.\\
58 - Would you please stop talking?\\
59 - Tempers flare as the pressure mounts.\\
60 - Oh, yeah!\\
61 - It's unbelievable.\\
62 - And eagle on the 18th.\\
63 - This has never happened before in the history of sock golf.\\
64 - Little help here.\\
65 - Fans are coming out of the gallery\\
66 - with sacks of groceries for the young phenom.\\
67 - What's going on?\\
68 - I won. I beat Uncle Charlie.\\
69 - Excuse me.\\
70 - Didn't I ask you to fold the laundry?\\
71 - Laundry?\\
72 - Are you barking mad?\\
73 - The child just won the coveted Palmolive Cup.\\
74 - * I won, you lose, I won... *\\
75 - Charlie...\\
76 - when I ask Jake to do something, I need you to help me make sure\\
77 - that he does it.\\
78 - I'm trying to teach him\\
79 - responsibility.\\
80 - This sock is soaking wet.\\
81 - Yeah, I chipped into the water hazard\\
82 - on the ninth and the lid was open.\\
83 - So, this is toilet water.\\
84 - At least.\\
85 - All right,\\
86 - I put Jake to bed, I folded the laundry,\\
87 - I put the groceries away...\\
88 - The guilt thing doesn't work on me, Alan.\\
89 - Yeah, well, it's all I got.\\
90 - I'll be back in a little while.\\
91 - Where are you going?\\
92 - Oh, I have to bring the garbage cans back in.\\
93 - Today wasn't garbage day.\\
94 - Oh, no, not here. At Judith's.\\
95 - At Judith's?\\
96 - Alan, your wife threw you out.\\
97 - Yeah, well, that doesn't mean she doesn't need me.\\
98 - Yeah, it kind of does.\\
99 - Well, look, we're still married.\\
100 - It's still my house,\\
101 - and she still counts on me to do a few chores.\\
102 - It's good.\\
103 - It leaves the door open for, you know, reconciliation.\\
104 - I see.\\
105 - So, how do you lift those garbage cans without a spine?\\
106 - They're on wheels.\\
107 - What are you watching?\\
108 - I'm watching a movie.\\
109 - And you're not supposed to be watching anything.\\
110 - Oh, yeah.\\
111 - Is that guy a good guy or a bad guy?\\
112 - Good guy.\\
113 - And you're not supposed to be watching TV.\\
114 - I know.\\
115 - Is that his girlfriend?\\
116 - Ex-girlfriend.\\
117 - But he still loves her, right?\\
118 - I'm not going to walk you through the whole movie.\\
119 - I think so.\\
120 - Go to bed, Jake.\\
121 - Okay.\\
122 - Who's that guy?\\
123 - That's the guy he was in jail with\\
124 - and told him where the money was hidden.\\
125 - Oh, right.\\
126 - Hey, you're being punished.\\
127 - No TV.\\
128 - I know.\\
129 - ( door opening )\\
130 - What the hell is going on?\\
131 - BOTH: Shh.\\
132 - Jake.\\
133 - Good night.\\
134 - Hey, I'm watching that.\\
135 - What part of "no TV" didn't you understand?\\
136 - I'm allowed to watch TV.\\
137 - I mean Jake.\\
138 - I said, "No TV." He said, "Okay."\\
139 - I said, "Go to bed." He said, "Okay."\\
140 - What do you want from me?\\
141 - Charlie, he's taking advantage of you\\
142 - because he knows you won't follow through.\\
143 - Well he obviously knows me better than you do.\\
144 - Okay, look, if this is going to work out\\
145 - with Jake living here part-time, you have to be an adult.\\
146 - You have to impose discipline.\\
147 - Yeah, fine, whatever.\\
148 - Give me back the remote.\\
149 - No, no, you're not listening to me.\\
150 - You need to be firm.\\
151 - Okay.\\
152 - Go to your room.\\
153 - Yes, like that.\\
154 - I mean it.\\
155 - Give me the remote and go to your room.\\
156 - That's very funny. Ha-ha.\\
157 - I'm serious. Get out of here.\\
158 - I will kick your ass.\\
159 - Oh, man.\\
160 - Shoo.\\
161 - ( "Road Runner" plays )\\
162 - Jake.\\
163 - ( firmer ): Jake.\\
164 - It was on when I came in.\\
165 - Yeah, right.\\
166 - What did I tell you about leaving juice boxes on my piano?\\
167 - How do you know it's mine?\\
168 - Oh, come on.\\
169 - Who else around here drinks "Transylvania Goofy Juice"?\\
170 - Good point.\\
171 - And another thing,\\
172 - were you on the deck feeding the seagulls again?\\
173 - Sorry, I forgot.\\
174 - Okay.\\
175 - We need to talk.\\
176 - Love you, Uncle Charlie.\\
177 - Look, we don't feed the seagulls\\
178 - because you can't get rid of them.\\
179 - And we don't leave the doors and windows open\\
180 - because we get all kinds of bugs and crap flying in the house.\\
181 - Okay.\\
182 - No, no, no, don't just say, "Okay."\\
183 - This is not the grown-up telling the kid what to do.\\
184 - This is just two guys agreeing how to live together.\\
185 - Are we cool?\\
186 - Yeah, cool.\\
187 - Hey.\\
188 - What's going on?\\
189 - Nothing.\\
190 - Was he watching TV?\\
191 - No.\\
192 - Jake, I have to run\\
193 - a quick errand,\\
194 - so why don't you wash and dress\\
195 - and when I get back we'll do something fun.\\
196 - Can we watch TV?\\
197 - Go.\\
198 - Where are you off to?\\
199 - Uh, the, uh, uh... grocery store.\\
200 - You're going to Judith's, aren't you?\\
201 - ( scoffs )\\
202 - No.\\
203 - Then where are you going?\\
204 - Judith's.\\
205 - Oh, Alan.\\
206 - I have to. I have to.\\
207 - The-the-the-timer\\
208 - on the sprinkler system is broken\\
209 - and the flower beds are getting flooded,\\
210 - and I love her and I want her back.\\
211 - Oh, buddy, I feel for you.\\
212 - Well, thank you.\\
213 - Unfortunately, the feeling is nausea.\\
214 - Great, great. I'll see you later.\\
215 - Alan, you've been making the same mistake your whole life.\\
216 - Being the good boy,\\
217 - fixing everything so everybody would love you.\\
218 - It didn't work with Mom,\\
219 - didn't work with either of the women you went out with.\\
220 - And it's not going to work with your wife.\\
221 - Charlie, you know nothing about commitment\\
222 - and responsibility to a relationship.\\
223 - Granted, but I do know when a woman's using me.\\
224 - And by that I mean not in a fun way.\\
225 - Well, you can rest easy,\\
226 - because no one is using me.\\
227 - And did you mean that I only dated two women\\
228 - including Judith?\\
229 - Because,\\
230 - because if you did, I have two words for you.\\
231 - Maxine Chernakoff.\\
232 - Ya!\\
233 - Did you fix it?\\
234 - Not quite.\\
235 - Doesn't seem like you're changing anything.\\
236 - Well, no, well, sometimes change happens, Judith,\\
237 - and you can't see it.\\
238 - Okay, fine.\\
239 - When you're done fixing this,\\
240 - would you come inside\\
241 - and take a look at the garbage disposal?\\
242 - Sure. Thank you.\\
243 - Wait, no.\\
244 - What?\\
245 - No, I-I won't come inside\\
246 - and look at the garbage disposal.\\
247 - Why not?\\
248 - I know when I'm being used, Judith,\\
249 - and not in a fun way.\\
250 - What are you talking about?\\
251 - Who are we kidding?\\
252 - The marriage is over.\\
253 - You're just afraid to move on,\\
254 - so you keep dragging me over here,\\
255 - and I'm afraid to move on, so I keep coming.\\
256 - Good-bye, Judith.\\
257 - You're free. I...\\
258 - I hope you find whatever it is you're looking for.\\
259 - Jake?\\
260 - What you got there?\\
261 - Just a little bread.\\
262 - Please tell me you're not feeding the seagulls again.\\
263 - ( seagull screeching )\\
264 - Okay.\\
265 - Oh, man, did you let another one\\
266 - of those big, flappy bastards in the house?\\
267 - You have to put a dollar in the swear jar.\\
268 - You said "bastards."\\
269 - Smart-- poke the bear.\\
270 - I'm telling you, Jake, this is the last ti...\\
271 - ( seagulls crying )\\
272 - Yikes.\\
273 - I'm really sorry, Uncle Charlie.\\
274 - I don't want to talk to you right now.\\
275 - Hello, uh, do you have a department\\
276 - of animal control or bird abatement?\\
277 - I have a seagull problem.\\
278 - Sea-gull.\\
279 - Thank you. I'll hold.\\
280 - I didn't know there'd be so many.\\
281 - I told you, don't feed the damn things.\\
282 - I told you, don't leave the windows open.\\
283 - Yeah, hi, uh-uh, who is this?\\
284 - Phyllis Siegal.\\
285 - No, no, Phyllis,\\
286 - I-I wanted to talk to somebody about seagulls.\\
287 - I got a flock of seagulls in my house.\\
288 - No, I don't know whatever happened to them.\\
289 - I'm really sorry.\\
290 - We had an agreement, Jake, and you broke it.\\
291 - Look, uh, I-I need somebody\\
292 - who can come over with a net or something.\\
293 - Sure. I'll hold.\\
294 - Hello? Who is this?\\
295 - Annette.\\
296 - Look, I got a room filled with seagulls.\\
297 - No-no-no-no-no...\\
298 - Hi, Phyllis.\\
299 - Hey.\\
300 - Good-bye, Phyllis.\\
301 - Good news.\\
302 - Really?\\
303 - Come tell me in Jake's room.\\
304 - What did he do?\\
305 - He didn't paint anything, did he?\\
306 - I want you to be surprised.\\
307 - You will never guess what happened\\
308 - while I was at Judith's.\\
309 - Neither will you.\\
310 - ( gulls squawking )\\
311 - Oh, my God!\\
312 - So what's your good news?\\
313 - Open the door!\\
314 - Your kid got 'em in there.\\
315 - You get 'em out.\\
316 - ( banging door )\\
317 - Open... this door!\\
318 - That was not funny, Charlie.\\
319 - Depends on what side of the door you were on.\\
320 - Look, I-I'm really sorry about the birds,\\
321 - but I'm sure they'll leave as soon as they get hungry.\\
322 - That's what I thought about you.\\
323 - Well, you know what-- Jake and I may be\\
324 - out of here sooner than you think.\\
325 - What do you mean?\\
326 - At Judith's, there was kissing.\\
327 - Mutual kissing.\\
328 - Unprompted, but reciprocated by yours truly.\\
329 - Wow. Mm.\\
330 - And was it as boring as it sounds?\\
331 - Charlie, Charlie, she kissed me,\\
332 - and this was not the kiss of a woman\\
333 - who just wanted her garbage disposal unclogged.\\
334 - Well, you know her plumbing better than I do.\\
335 - You know what I'm going to do?\\
336 - I'm going to let her come to me.\\
337 - You know, be detached.\\
338 - Play it cool.\\
339 - Yeah, that's your home run swing.\\
340 - Hey, Uncle Charlie, want to play some sock golf?\\
341 - No, thanks.\\
342 - JAKE: Where you going?\\
343 - CHARLIE: Going for a drive.\\
344 - Can I come? Nope.\\
345 - I don't think Uncle Charlie likes me anymore.\\
346 - Don't be silly.\\
347 - He-he's just a little upset\\
348 - about the 30, 40 screaming, crapping birds in his house.\\
349 - Why don't you, uh...\\
350 - Why don't you write him a note and tell him how sorry you are.\\
351 - Okay.\\
352 - Don't worry. He'll come around.\\
353 - Sooner or later, everybody comes around.\\
354 - You just have to give 'em a little time...\\
355 - and a little space.\\
356 - Hello, Judith?\\
357 - What's in the bucket?\\
358 - Chum.\\
359 - What?\\
360 - Bait.\\
361 - I went down to the bait shop\\
362 - and asked them what seagulls liked to eat.\\
363 - We're keeping them?\\
364 - No. We're going to throw the bait out the window\\
365 - to lure the birds out of the house.\\
366 - Oh, that-that's pretty clever.\\
367 - Yeah, it's a variation\\
368 - on something I do with women and tennis bracelets.\\
369 - Hey, Uncle Charlie, I made this for you.\\
370 - Thanks.\\
371 - I made it myself.\\
372 - I see that.\\
373 - What you doing?\\
374 - Getting rid of the birds.\\
375 - Can I help?\\
376 - Nope.\\
377 - Uh, Jake, why don't you go out and play on the deck, okay?\\
378 - Okay.\\
379 - What is wrong with you?\\
380 - He worked really hard on that card.\\
381 - You barely looked at it.\\
382 - What do you want from me, Alan?\\
383 - Well, he's dying for you to forgive him.\\
384 - Fine. I forgive him.\\
385 - Now, are you going to help me or not?\\
386 - I got a serious problem here.\\
387 - Really? 'Cause you look like you have it all together.\\
388 - Okay, here's the deal.\\
389 - We go in there\\
390 - and start throwing this stuff out the windows.\\
391 - When the last bird's out,\\
392 - we close the window and get on with our lives.\\
393 - You ready?\\
394 - Sure.\\
395 - You know, if they love this bait so much,\\
396 - why would they even wait for...\\
397 - ( gulls squawking ) ( screaming )\\
398 - It's almost like somebody tipped 'em off.\\
399 - Got any other bright ideas?\\
400 - Yeah.\\
401 - I'm going to get a dry wall guy in there\\
402 - and seal off that room.\\
403 - Very funny.\\
404 - I'm not kidding.\\
405 - That room is dead to me.\\
406 - It's either that or sell the house.\\
407 - I'll put it on the market\\
408 - as a two-bedroom-plus aviary.\\
409 - Everybody loves an aviary.\\
410 - What about Jake?\\
411 - You going to put him on the market,\\
412 - or just wall him off?\\
413 - Hey, I tried with that kid, Alan.\\
414 - He-he-he says one thing and then he goes and does another.\\
415 - He's ten. He's got the attention span of a hummingbird.\\
416 - Well, then, what am I supposed to do when he ignores me?\\
417 - You punish him-- you-you take away his computer,\\
418 - his-his TV, his toys.\\
419 - Well, you already took away all the good stuff.\\
420 - What am I supposed to take away-- his bronchial inhaler?\\
421 - You know what I'm saying, Charlie.\\
422 - You just... you don't... take away your love.\\
423 - Hi, uh,\\
424 - I tried calling,\\
425 - but I kept getting your machine,\\
426 - so I thought I'd bring this over.\\
427 - What is it?\\
428 - Oh, it's my master file of, uh, handymen,\\
429 - plumbers, electricians, maintenance schedules,\\
430 - warranties, authorized repair centers, um...\\
431 - et cetera.\\
432 - Okay, well, uh, you're on your own.\\
433 - Got to run.\\
434 - Alan, wait.\\
435 - Yes?\\
436 - About that kiss...\\
437 - Ah.\\
438 - When you said we should move on,\\
439 - I got scared,\\
440 - and, uh...\\
441 - Alan, I kissed you out of fear.\\
442 - Hey, it still counts.\\
443 - Alan, you were right.\\
444 - We have to move on.\\
445 - Okay.\\
446 - Alan, wait.\\
447 - Yes?\\
448 - The garbage disposal's still making that horrible noise.\\
449 - Well, I keep telling you not to put bones in it.\\
450 - I didn't.\\
451 - The sink trap does not lie, Judith.\\
452 - This is so cool, Uncle Charlie.\\
453 - Yeah, well, I was kind of hard on you, and I...\\
454 - I wanted to make it up.\\
455 - So you're not still mad about the seagulls?\\
456 - Oh, I'm still mad.\\
457 - I just figured out a better way to deal with it.\\
458 - Well, I think this is a very good way.\\
459 - Me, too.\\
460 - I'm buying you all this stuff,\\
461 - but, as punishment for letting seagulls in my house,\\
462 - you can't play with it for a month.\\
463 - A month?\\
464 - Pretty smart, huh?\\
465 - It's not fair.\\
466 - You know what this is?\\
467 - The world's smallest violin.\\
468 - What are you talking about?\\
469 - They're gone, Charlie.\\
470 - Are you sure?\\
471 - Check under the bed.\\
472 - All clear.\\
473 - Okay.\\
474 - I wonder why they left.\\
475 - Maybe because we stopped feeding them.\\
476 - Whoa, check it out.\\
477 - Wow.\\
478 - You know what this means, don't you?\\
479 - Yeah.\\
480 - Breakfast.

9 - Hey, Uncle Charlie.\\
10 - Hi, shorty.\\
11 - Hello, Charlie.\\
12 - Hey, Judith. What are you doing here?\\
13 - If you must know,\\
14 - I'm here to help Jake set up his room\\
15 - so he feels like nothing's changed.\\
16 - Really?\\
17 - You don't think he'll notice that his Dad's living here\\
18 - and his Mom's dating chicks?\\
19 - Could you say that a little louder?\\
20 - Jake might not have heard you.\\
21 - And just for the record, I'm not dating anyone\\
22 - and I threw your brother out\\
23 - 'cause he was sucking the life out of me.\\
24 - Could you say that a little louder?\\
25 - Uncle Charlie hasn't met Porky yet.\\
26 - I don't suppose that's a Rubenesque 19-year-old girl.\\
27 - Porky's his pet guinea pig.\\
28 - You're bringing vermin into my house?\\
29 - Uncle Charlie, check him out. Isn't he awesome?\\
30 - Yeah.\\
31 - See those little black things?\\
32 - That's his poop.\\
33 - Awesome.\\
34 - I don't want him in the water this weekend.\\
35 - He might have an ear infection.\\
36 - Oh, Mom.\\
37 - Oh, no, it's okay, pal.\\
38 - We can go to Disneyland. We'll have a great weekend.\\
39 - We can, we can play miniature golf,\\
40 - we can go bowling, bike riding,\\
41 - whatever you want.\\
42 - Alan, relax, you're starting to sound\\
43 - like a tampon commercial.\\
44 - Jake, why don't you go put Porky in your room?\\
45 - Okay.\\
46 - Alan, I'm very concerned.\\
47 - He's just a child.\\
48 - I don't know if he can deal with this.\\
49 - Give your son some credit. He's an incredible kid.\\
50 - I was talking about you.\\
51 - That's fair.\\
52 - Yeah.\\
53 - * Men...\\
54 - Charlie?\\
55 - That strange lady from down the beach is back.\\
56 - Oh, yeah, she's here to baby-sit.\\
57 - Come again?\\
58 - Thought we'd go out and have a drink.\\
59 - You want me to leave my son\\
60 - with the whack job who's been stalking you\\
61 - since your one-night stand?\\
62 - Hey, you try and find a baby-sitter on a Friday night.\\
63 - It's okay, Alan.\\
64 - Charlie and I talked and I understand\\
65 - that we're just friends, and that it's not okay\\
66 - for me to sneak into his house\\
67 - and lick all his silverware.\\
68 - As reassuring as that sounds,\\
69 - we can't go out tonight.\\
70 - We're getting up early to go to Disneyland.\\
71 - We?\\
72 - Yeah.\\
73 - I thought maybe you'd want to come with us.\\
74 - Alan, I'm not thrilled about having\\
75 - one small rodent in my house.\\
76 - Why would I drive 50 miles to see their kingdom?\\
77 - I'll go! I'll go!\\
78 - Maybe some other time, Rose.\\
79 - And it turns out,\\
80 - we're not going to need a baby-sitter tonight.\\
81 - No problem.\\
82 - I'm going to take this seat cushion, okay?\\
83 - Knock yourself out.\\
84 - Why does she want your seat cushion?\\
85 - I don't know why she brought it,\\
86 - I don't know why she's taking it.\\
87 - Okay, then, I'll see you later.\\
88 - You're still going out?\\
89 - Yeah. Why?\\
90 - I thought you wanted us to spend some time together.\\
91 - Here?\\
92 - Yeah.\\
93 - Okay.\\
94 - What were you thinking? Ten, 15 minutes?\\
95 - Go. Thanks.\\
96 - ( Jake in cartoon voice ): Good morning, Uncle Charlie.\\
97 - Morning, Porky.\\
98 - Did you have sweet dreams?\\
99 - Jake, rule number one.\\
100 - Uncle Charlie does not like to start his day\\
101 - with a squealing creature in his face.\\
102 - Sorry.\\
103 - Grandma's here.\\
104 - She wants you to come down.\\
105 - Okay, you're not listening.\\
106 - Rule number one...\\
107 - This is a list of the top\\
108 - divorce attorneys in Los Angeles.\\
109 - I've made appointments for you with each of them.\\
110 - Mom, I don't need to meet any attorneys.\\
111 - I'm not getting a divorce.\\
112 - I'm sure you don't think so.\\
113 - The point is, if you consult with all the good lawyers,\\
114 - it's a conflict of interest\\
115 - for them to represent Judith.\\
116 - She'll be stuck with some ambulance-chasing clown\\
117 - from Van Nuys who will fold like an origami swan.\\
118 - Look, I don't want this to be...\\
119 - Mommy busted her hump on this, Alan.\\
120 - Thank you?\\
121 - Morning.\\
122 - Is that all you have to say for yourself?\\
123 - You haven't returned any of my calls this week.\\
124 - It's all I can do to not imagine you\\
125 - lying dead in a ditch somewhere.\\
126 - Right back at you, Mom.\\
127 - What did you want to talk about?\\
128 - You're too late. I'm not speaking to you.\\
129 - All right.\\
130 - Would you like to know why?\\
131 - No, I trust your judgment.\\
132 - Because when your brother's marriage ended...\\
133 - Yes, I know, Alan, blah, blah, blah.\\
134 - ...and he chose to move in here,\\
135 - your coldness towards your mother\\
136 - became more than just the behavior\\
137 - of an ungrateful son.\\
138 - It's now an obstacle to my spending\\
139 - quality time with my beloved grandchild.\\
140 - Are you coming to Disneyland with us, Grandma?\\
141 - Oh, darling, Grandma doesn't do Anaheim.\\
142 - Well, uh, we better hit the road.\\
143 - Try to beat the traffic. Thanks for dropping by, Mom.\\
144 - Come on, let's go, Jake. Race you to the car.\\
145 - Bye, Grandma. Bye, Uncle Charlie.\\
146 - Bye.\\
147 - Wait for me, I'm going!\\
148 - Come on, boy. Come on, boy.\\
149 - Heel, heel, heel, stay.\\
150 - Oh, who's a good dog? Who's a good dog?\\
151 - Hey, Jake, uh, you want to take him?\\
152 - Whatever. Come on.\\
153 - Get ready for bed.\\
154 - I'll be right in to tuck you in.\\
155 - "Happiest place on Earth," my snow-white ass.\\
156 - I had a good time.\\
157 - Oh, really?\\
158 - Which part did you like best--\\
159 - the equatorial heat, the endless lines,\\
160 - or the large German woman\\
161 - that threw up on me in the Teacup?\\
162 - Okay, okay.\\
163 - Maybe things could have gone smoother,\\
164 - but tomorrow is going to make up for it.\\
165 - Alan, you could get us all laid tomorrow,\\
166 - it's not going to make up for it.\\
167 - Hey, sleepyhead. You're just in time.\\
168 - Pancakes are almost ready.\\
169 - I'm not hungry.\\
170 - Not hungry?\\
171 - Come on, you've got to fuel up that engine,\\
172 - got a big day planned.\\
173 - My ear hurts.\\
174 - Oh, no.\\
175 - Let me feel.\\
176 - Yeah, you're a little warm.\\
177 - Probably another ear infection.\\
178 - Um...\\
179 - Okay, okay, new plan.\\
180 - We'll, uh, we'll get you on the antibiotics.\\
181 - We'll, uh, we'll watch a little TV,\\
182 - play some video games... we'll have a great day.\\
183 - I want to go home.\\
184 - You, uh, you are home.\\
185 - I know, but the real one, with Mom.\\
186 - Okay, uh, I can understand that.\\
187 - You know, when a guy's feeling sick,\\
188 - he needs his Mom. Right, Charlie?\\
189 - Well...\\
190 - I may not be the one to ask.\\
191 - Okay, I'll, uh, I'll call your Mom\\
192 - and, uh, and tell her we're on our way.\\
193 - All right, it's just you and me now.\\
194 - Are you really sick or are you just faking it\\
195 - to get out of another fun-filled afternoon?\\
196 - I'm really sick.\\
197 - Just checking.\\
198 - Because I was going to fake it.\\
199 - ( melody of "Ode to Joy" ): * If your home is bug infested\\
200 - * Filled with spiders, flies or gnats *\\
201 - * All our sprays are safety tested *\\
202 - * We kill vermin, not your cats. *\\
203 - Hey.\\
204 - How's the jingle coming?\\
205 - The lyrics are fine, the music needs a little work.\\
206 - How's Jake?\\
207 - Uh, he'll be okay.\\
208 - I stayed over at the house a little while.\\
209 - We watched some movies.\\
210 - I, uh, made us some soup\\
211 - and a couple of sandwiches.\\
212 - And, uh, Judith suggested I take mine to go.\\
213 - Suggested?\\
214 - Well, she started my car\\
215 - and threw my sandwich in the backseat.\\
216 - Uh, listen, I'm afraid I got\\
217 - some more bad news for you.\\
218 - Oh, no! I forgot to bring Porky back.\\
219 - See, that's the thing.\\
220 - Nothing's bringing Porky back.\\
221 - Porky's dead?\\
222 - Th-th-th-that's all, folks.\\
223 - Oh, God...\\
224 - oh, God.\\
225 - It's okay.\\
226 - We'll can get, we can get Jake another guinea pig.\\
227 - Jake'll be fine.\\
228 - This is his fourth Porky in three years.\\
229 - He goes through them faster than shoes.\\
230 - No... this is about my life.\\
231 - Everything is going to hell.\\
232 - Okay. Well, uh...\\
233 - don't, don't cry.\\
234 - We can still be friends.\\
235 - What?\\
236 - Sorry. It's the only thing I know to say\\
237 - when someone cries around here.\\
238 - I'm so sorry, Porky.\\
239 - You just kept running around in your little cage\\
240 - trying to make everybody happy.\\
241 - And what do you get?\\
242 - You get dead.\\
243 - You do know the pig can't hear you, right?\\
244 - Don't you get it?\\
245 - I am the pig!\\
246 - Okay, okay, I-I-I'm just asking\\
247 - because your, your reaction doesn't seem very healthy to me.\\
248 - And what do you think would be healthy, Charlie?\\
249 - I don't know.\\
250 - Why don't we toss Porky in the ocean and go get bombed?\\
251 - How could you? How could you?\\
252 - Okay.\\
253 - Toss him in the ocean.\\
254 - Very clever.\\
255 - Who knew pelicans eat guinea pigs?\\
256 - ( barking like dogs )\\
257 - What's happening?\\
258 - Sunday's Tequila Night at Pavlov's.\\
259 - Every time the bell rings,\\
260 - you got to take a shot.\\
261 - Why?\\
262 - 'Cause the bell rings.\\
263 - Oh. Okay.\\
264 - You got to bark first.\\
265 - Woof.\\
266 - Charlie...\\
267 - when my son looked at me\\
268 - and told me that he wanted to go home,\\
269 - it broke my heart.\\
270 - I saw.\\
271 - I mean, my kid is sick, and I can't even be with him.\\
272 - I-I... you know, I'm-I'm a failure, Charlie.\\
273 - I'm-I'm a failure as a father.\\
274 - I'm a failure as a husband.\\
275 - You didn't fail.\\
276 - First of all, that little boy loves you,\\
277 - and second of all, just because your wife decides\\
278 - she doesn't like sleeping with men\\
279 - doesn't mean you failed as a husband...\\
280 - although I wouldn't brag about it.\\
281 - You're right. You're right.\\
282 - This is Judith's fault.\\
283 - She's the one who-who breached\\
284 - our marriage contract asunder,\\
285 - and-and, and-and I let her make decisions\\
286 - that should've been in my dominion.\\
287 - Alan, people are going to do\\
288 - whatever they're going to do in this world.\\
289 - The only thing a man can control is his own actions.\\
290 - ( bell rings )\\
291 - ( barking )\\
292 - Remember where we left our car.\\
293 - This isn't our car?\\
294 - Where to?\\
295 - Home. Home.\\
296 - And that would be...\\
297 - Sherman Oaks.\\
298 - We don't live in Sherman Oaks.\\
299 - I do.\\
300 - I am a Sherman Oaksian,\\
301 - and-and I am going home for as to reclaim my home.\\
302 - Oh, that's a very bad idea.\\
303 - I'll tell you what's a good idea:\\
304 - chili cheese fries and a large root beer...\\
305 - with chili cheese fries...\\
306 - and girls.\\
307 - No.\\
308 - I am going home to my wife\\
309 - to impose my dominion over her.\\
310 - Oh, yeah. The lesbians love that.\\
311 - Driver, Sherman Oaks!\\
312 - CABBIE: 1167 Bonnie Meadow Drive.\\
313 - Good-bye, Charlie.\\
314 - I'll be back for my things tomorrow.\\
315 - Thank you, driver.\\
316 - You've been most kind.\\
317 - ( door shuts )\\
318 - So, back to Malibu?\\
319 - No. Let's give it a second.\\
320 - Did you know...\\
321 - they put chocolate pudding in tubes now?\\
322 - No. No, I did not.\\
323 - They do.\\
324 - My nephew eats them.\\
325 - They're surprisingly good.\\
326 - Well, that's an interesting sibling dynamic\\
327 - you've got going with your brother there.\\
328 - You get that I'm loaded, right?\\
329 - ( door opens )\\
330 - Drive, drive, drive!\\
331 - ( tires screeching )\\
332 - So...\\
333 - how'd it go?\\
334 - She-she chased me out of the house\\
335 - with a... with a golf club.\\
336 - Huh.\\
337 - Taking up golf already.\\
338 - What was it-- like, a six iron?\\
339 - What difference does it make?\\
340 - I just want to be able to tell the story accurately.\\
341 - It's not funny.\\
342 - Then why are you laughing?\\
343 - 'Cause I don't know what else to do.\\
344 - I wish I could ask Dad for advice.\\
345 - You'd go to Dad for marriage counseling?\\
346 - Alan, our father committed suicide\\
347 - to get away from our mother.\\
348 - What are you talking about?\\
349 - Dad didn't commit suicide.\\
350 - He-he died of food poisoning.\\
351 - I maintain that he knew the fish was bad,\\
352 - but he kept eating it anyway.\\
353 - Your mother sounds like a real piece of work.\\
354 - Oh, you have no idea, my friend.\\
355 - My mother took my baby brother,\\
356 - and dipped him in sissy sauce,\\
357 - and turned him into the people-pleasing control freak\\
358 - you see today.\\
359 - That's right...\\
360 - and-and she made him\\
361 - so scared of intimacy,\\
362 - that-that he has just this endless stream of gorgeous girls\\
363 - running in and out of his life.\\
364 - Damn her.\\
365 - You know, many psychologists agree.\\
366 - Until the core maternal relationship is resolved,\\
367 - most men are doomed to repeat\\
368 - dysfunctional childhood patterns.\\
369 - Just drive the cab, Dr. Phil.\\
370 - You know, Charlie,\\
371 - he's not wrong.\\
372 - I mean, at-at some point,\\
373 - we have to stand up to her.\\
374 - Oh, well, look who's got beer muscles all of a sudden.\\
375 - No, no, I'm serious, I'm serious, come on.\\
376 - Right now. Let's-let's confront her.\\
377 - You-you with me? Come on.\\
378 - Oh, my God. Oh, my God.\\
379 - I can't believe it.\\
380 - You really are afraid of Mom.\\
381 - I am not.\\
382 - All these years, I thought you were so cool,\\
383 - but you're just a big, clucking chicken.\\
384 - Ouch.\\
385 - Ouch? Okay, okay, that's it.\\
386 - We have a new destination: Beverly Hills.\\
387 - You got an address?\\
388 - Just go east on Sunset\\
389 - until you reach the gates of hell.\\
390 - She'll buzz us in.\\
391 - I can't wait to see her face.\\
392 - Yeah, she's going to freak.\\
393 - You ready?\\
394 - Ring the bell. Ring the bell.\\
395 - Okay.\\
396 - ( doorbell rings )\\
397 - ( barking )\\
398 - EVELYN: Who is it?!\\
399 - It's your sons.\\
400 - Charlie and Alan.\\
401 - Hi, Mom. Hi, Mom.\\
402 - EVELYN: Oh, dear God. Hold on. I'll be right there.\\
403 - Hey, uh... what exactly are we going to say to her?\\
404 - Now you ask?\\
405 - This was your safari.\\
406 - Well, we're here to resolve the core maternal... thing.\\
407 - Wait, aha! I'll go ask the cabbie.\\
408 - Nice try.\\
409 - Somebody'd better be dead.\\
410 - Porky's dead.\\
411 - And you completely screwed up our lives.\\
412 - I'm sorry?\\
413 - Well, that's good enough for me. Yeah, I'm good.\\
414 - Night. Night.\\
415 - BOTH: Drive, drive, drive!\\
416 - Good morning, sunshine.\\
417 - Oh, God.\\
418 - Close the drapes.\\
419 - Hey, what's this?\\
420 - "Release and indemnification form."\\
421 - What?\\
422 - Were you on some kind of television show last night?\\
423 - I don't think so.\\
424 - Well, you and your brother signed it.\\
425 - Let me see that.\\
426 - Alan...\\
427 - Alan!\\
428 - Wake up.\\
429 - We got a problem.\\
430 - "Taxicab Confessions"?\\
431 - * If you've got bugs\\
432 - * If you've got ants\\
433 - * If you've got bugs and flies and slugs *\\
434 - * And things that crawl...\\
435 - Huh?\\
436 - Isn't that Beethoven?\\
437 - Shh!\\
438 - I don't...\\
439 - I don't even know\\
440 - how my wife is going to be a lesbian.\\
441 - She hates oral sex.\\
442 - Hates it.
\subsection {Episode 04: If I Can't Write My Chocolate Song, I'm Going to Take..}
1 - WOMAN: Charlie,\\
2 - honey, wake up.\\
3 - Good morning.\\
4 - You lied to me, Charlie.\\
5 - You said it was just going to be the two of us.\\
6 - I didn't lie, Berta.\\
7 - Things change.\\
8 - Good-bye, Charlie.\\
9 - Don't leave me, Berta.\\
10 - I love you.\\
11 - Can't we talk about this?\\
12 - Sorry.\\
13 - I do single men only.\\
14 - I'm in, I'm out.\\
15 - There are no complications.\\
16 - But I am single.\\
17 - ALAN: Uh, Berta,\\
18 - I hate to bring this up again,\\
19 - but you just... you cannot\\
20 - put the peanut butter in the refrigerator.\\
21 - It gets hard.\\
22 - And, uh,\\
23 - and on a related subject--\\
24 - the peanut butter stains\\
25 - on Jake's shirts really require an enzyme presoak.\\
26 - I hope you two will be very happy together.\\
27 - But who's going to take care of me?\\
28 - Who's going to do the laundry\\
29 - and the shopping and the cleaning\\
30 - and all the other stuff?\\
31 - Ask the scrubbing bubble there.\\
32 - Uncle Charlie, why is Berta leaving?\\
33 - Why?\\
34 - Doesn't matter, Jake.\\
35 - What matters is she's gone.\\
36 - And we're all going to die.\\
37 - * Men... *\\
38 - She left before she made the coffee.\\
39 - So?\\
40 - We'll make our own coffee.\\
41 - How?\\
42 - So now we just wait?\\
43 - Yes. It-It takes a couple of minutes.\\
44 - Alan, this goes beyond coffee.\\
45 - Berta's been with me forever.\\
46 - She does everything.\\
47 - She's like a wife that leaves before you wake up\\
48 - and doesn't mind if you sleep around.\\
49 - ( bell dings )\\
50 - Is that the coffee?\\
51 - It's my peanut butter.\\
52 - Made it soft.\\
53 - Charlie, I've been trying\\
54 - to figure out a way to repay you\\
55 - for letting me and Jake stay here.\\
56 - Why don't I take over the housework?\\
57 - Berta did the shopping, too.\\
58 - I can do that.\\
59 - She did my laundry.\\
60 - In her way, yes.\\
61 - But I can handle that, too.\\
62 - And look.\\
63 - I even made your coffee.\\
64 - Thank you.\\
65 - Hmm.\\
66 - No. Uh-uh.\\
67 - Not as good as Berta's. Well,\\
68 - it's her coffee.\\
69 - I just... I just pressed the button.\\
70 - Berta's tasted-- I don't know--\\
71 - Christmassy.\\
72 - Well-well, what does that mean, "Christmassy?" What...?\\
73 - It means, like Christmas.\\
74 - No. You...\\
75 - you got to work with me, Charlie.\\
76 - I mean, nutmeg, cinnamon, powdered reindeer?\\
77 - I don't know.\\
78 - It's just that when you drank it,\\
79 - Sweet 'N Low, half and half,\\
80 - Mocha Mix.\\
81 - No, forget it.\\
82 - I'll just read my paper.\\
83 - Uh-oh.\\
84 - Where's my paper?\\
85 - I don't know.\\
86 - You might try looking by the front door.\\
87 - No, no. It's usually right here on the table.\\
88 - Okay, so before you got up, Berta started the coffee\\
89 - and got you your paper.\\
90 - Well, I don't know the mechanics of it, but, yeah.\\
91 - I'll go get it.\\
92 - He's not off to a very good start.\\
93 - Want a glass of peanut butter?\\
94 - Here.\\
95 - Alan?\\
96 - Yeah.\\
97 - I can see you.\\
98 - And I can see you, too.\\
99 - No. I mean, Berta never cleaned when I was in the room.\\
100 - She was, like, invisible.\\
101 - I'm sorry.\\
102 - I'll try to be more transparent.\\
103 - Appreciate it.\\
104 - Oh, no.\\
105 - I see you.\\
106 - ALAN: Oh, give me a break.\\
107 - Not you.\\
108 - That girl that's been stalking me.\\
109 - Rose?\\
110 - Oh, there you are.\\
111 - ( laughs )\\
112 - What are you doing, sneaking up on me like that?\\
113 - ( laughs )\\
114 - Uh,\\
115 - Rose, honey,\\
116 - we spent one night together,\\
117 - and it was very nice, but...\\
118 - What was your favorite part?\\
119 - Gee, I'd have to say,\\
120 - finding out you live just two doors down.\\
121 - Sometimes it's all I can do\\
122 - not to shoot through that house in the middle.\\
123 - Yeah.\\
124 - Uh...\\
125 - but see, I'm not looking for a relationship right now,\\
126 - so maybe you should find someone\\
127 - who can give you the attention you want.\\
128 - Need. Deserve.\\
129 - Require.\\
130 - Are you saying we should see other people?\\
131 - Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying.\\
132 - You have so much love to give,\\
133 - and somewhere out there is a guy who...\\
134 - can take it.\\
135 - Well, there is this one guy...\\
136 - He sounds perfect.\\
137 - His-his name is Andy.\\
138 - He works at Jamba Juice.\\
139 - He always gives me a free wheat grass shooter\\
140 - and chuckles when I gag.\\
141 - ( laughs )\\
142 - Then ask him out.\\
143 - That seems kind of forward, don't you think?\\
144 - No. Come on.\\
145 - Women ask guys out all the time.\\
146 - What they don't do\\
147 - is handcuff themselves to the refrigerator\\
148 - when he says it's time to go home.\\
149 - That's where you and I went off the track, isn't it?\\
150 - Hey, I'm the past.\\
151 - Andy's the future.\\
152 - Bye-bye now.\\
153 - Good luck.\\
154 - Andy.\\
155 - ( plays piano )\\
156 - Alan?\\
157 - What did you do to my piano?\\
158 - Nothing. I just dusted.\\
159 - Yeah. Well, I'm-I'm sitting here\\
160 - trying to write a jingle about a chocolate bar,\\
161 - and my piano smells like lemons.\\
162 - Gee, I'm sorry, Charlie,\\
163 - but they don't make chocolate Pledge.\\
164 - Okay, maybe I'm not making myself clear.\\
165 - Mm-hmm.\\
166 - The rest of the house can smell like any food you want,\\
167 - but my piano needs to smell...\\
168 - Pianoey.\\
169 - There you go.\\
170 - Fine.\\
171 - I'll get an unscented polish.\\
172 - Well, that's not going to help me now, is it?\\
173 - Nope.\\
174 - You know what, Charlie?\\
175 - You are a child.\\
176 - You're a-a-a big, high-maintenance child.\\
177 - I am not a child.\\
178 - Where are you going?\\
179 - Well,\\
180 - if I can't write\\
181 - my chocolate song, I'm going to take a nap.\\
182 - ( whispering ): Charlie,\\
183 - are you asleep?\\
184 - I'm doing a load of whites.\\
185 - ( groans )\\
186 - Geez.\\
187 - Charlie?!\\
188 - What?\\
189 - You kicked me in your sleep.\\
190 - Who said I was asleep?\\
191 - I can't do this anymore.\\
192 - You are impossible.\\
193 - Hey, don't blame me.\\
194 - I tried to make it work.\\
195 - Excuse me.\\
196 - Berta quit at 9:00.\\
197 - It's now 2:30.\\
198 - When did you try?\\
199 - Where is the trying?\\
200 - Hey, you're the one who made Berta quit.\\
201 - I didn't make her quit.\\
202 - I simply raised the bar of quality housework,\\
203 - and she insisted on limboing under it.\\
204 - But since you obviously can't live without her--\\
205 - you big baby-- I will go apologize,\\
206 - and get her back. Great.\\
207 - So where does she live?\\
208 - I don't know.\\
209 - Okay.\\
210 - What's her last name?\\
211 - Your entire life depends on this woman,\\
212 - and you know nothing about her.\\
213 - Wait!\\
214 - She took a bus.\\
215 - I stand corrected.\\
216 - Oh, oh.\\
217 - Uh, after she works here in the morning,\\
218 - she cleans some rock star's house.\\
219 - Okay. What rock star? Where?\\
220 - ( knocking )\\
221 - Steven Tyler from Aerosmith.\\
222 - 4456 Malibu Canyon Road.\\
223 - Thank you.\\
224 - Now, listen, Judith is coming by\\
225 - at 5:00 to pick up Jake for dinner with her parents.\\
226 - Now I-I should be back by then, but you need to make sure\\
227 - that he is dressed and ready to go.\\
228 - No problem.\\
229 - No, no. It is a problem, Charlie.\\
230 - I am trying desperately to reconcile with my wife,\\
231 - so I don't want to do anything that's going to tick her off,\\
232 - so you telling me it's no problem\\
233 - does not reassure me. Here.\\
234 - Take my sock.\\
235 - I want to show you a trick.\\
236 - I'll go get Berta.\\
237 - You make sure Jake is ready.\\
238 - Hi.\\
239 - Hello.\\
240 - There are security cameras out front,\\
241 - so come up from the back and bring some dog treats\\
242 - in case the Rottweilers are out.\\
243 - Again, thank you.\\
244 - I asked Andy out, and he said yes.\\
245 - Andy, uh...\\
246 - The guy you told me to ask out.\\
247 - ( laughs )\\
248 - I just don't know what to wear.\\
249 - I love this one, but it still smells like pepper spray.\\
250 - Where are you going?\\
251 - To roll around naked on your bed.\\
252 - I'm just kidding.\\
253 - I'm going to try on the dress, silly.\\
254 - But...\\
255 - but...\\
256 - Is that lady your girlfriend?\\
257 - No. She's just...\\
258 - It's complicated.\\
259 - What the hell happened to you?\\
260 - You know what else is complicated?\\
261 - Fractions.\\
262 - You got grease all over you.\\
263 - It's in your hair, man.\\
264 - Yeah. My bike chain broke.\\
265 - Can you fix it?\\
266 - Kid, I'm a piano player.\\
267 - What do you think?\\
268 - Look, your mom's going to be here soon\\
269 - to take you to dinner.\\
270 - I know.\\
271 - So, how about a shower?\\
272 - No, thank you.\\
273 - That wasn't a question.\\
274 - But my bike's still broken. I think you made it worse.\\
275 - What are you talking about? Now you've got a unicycle.\\
276 - Get in the shower.\\
277 - I'm so worried he's not going to like me.\\
278 - He's going to love you, Rose.\\
279 - Just go out, have a great time, and don't come on too strong.\\
280 - Me, too strong? What do you mean?\\
281 - Okay, well, speaking from my own experience,\\
282 - there's nothing wrong with asking a guy for a blood test,\\
283 - but actually trying to take the blood yourself\\
284 - is a little strong.\\
285 - I see.\\
286 - Where are you going now?\\
287 - You've got me thinking this dress\\
288 - comes on too strong.\\
289 - So I'm going to put on something\\
290 - a little less "raahr!\\
291 - and a little more "ooh!"\\
292 - Jake!\\
293 - Why aren't you in the shower?\\
294 - Oh, yeah...\\
295 - Hi, Berta.\\
296 - It's me, the, uh, the scrubbing bubble.\\
297 - I, I, I came to apologize.\\
298 - Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.\\
299 - Come on. Can't, can't, can't we put aside\\
300 - our, our petty differences\\
301 - and, and, and find a way to work together\\
302 - out of, a, uh, uh, a mutual love for Charlie?\\
303 - Yeah, that's why I do this....\\
304 - for love.\\
305 - The thing is...\\
306 - I'm, I'm going through uh, uh, a really tough time right now.\\
307 - My, my marriage is collapsing.\\
308 - My, my business is slow.\\
309 - from his mother's house to, to, to Malibu.\\
310 - My alcoholic husband ran off\\
311 - with my daughter's parole officer\\
312 - and I clean rich people's toilets for a living.\\
313 - Okay, let's not make this a competition.\\
314 - Jake.\\
315 - You've been in there or a while. How's it going?\\
316 - Good.\\
317 - ( rattling )\\
318 - ( toilet flushes )\\
319 - What are you doing?\\
320 - Washing my bike chain. It's real dirty.\\
321 - Forget about the chain.\\
322 - You've got to take a shower before your mother gets here.\\
323 - We're going to need a new chain.\\
324 - ( phone ringing )\\
325 - Hello, Charlie's house. May I help you?\\
326 - Oh, hi, Alan, it's Rose.\\
327 - I got in. How'd you do?\\
328 - Oh, here he is.\\
329 - It's your brother.\\
330 - Thank you.\\
331 - How's it going? Did you talk to Berta?\\
332 - Yes, I'm, uh, I'm here with her now.\\
333 - Is, is Jake ready?\\
334 - Yeah, yeah, we're just applying the, uh, finishing touches.\\
335 - What about Berta?\\
336 - The same. Finishing touches.\\
337 - She's really a delight.\\
338 - Just, just make sure\\
339 - Jake is ready when Judith gets there.\\
340 - Relax. Everything's under control.\\
341 - I got to go.\\
342 - So you like this dress better?\\
343 - Hang on, Rose. The kid's running around on the deck in his underwear.\\
344 - Oh, sure, when I do it, you just ignore me.\\
345 - Jake!\\
346 - What are you doing?\\
347 - Air drying.\\
348 - You still have grease in your hair.\\
349 - Didn't you wash it?\\
350 - You didn't say to wash my hair.\\
351 - Wash your hair.\\
352 - Okay.\\
353 - You didn't tell him to rinse.\\
354 - Good. That's good. Thank you.\\
355 - Jake! Rinse!\\
356 - All right, so you won't come back.\\
357 - Will you at least tell me\\
358 - how you made the damn coffee Christmassy?\\
359 - Christmassy?\\
360 - Yeah, Charlie said your coffee tastes Christmassy.\\
361 - Oh, cinnamon.\\
362 - I said, "Cinnamon!"\\
363 - Oh, oh,\\
364 - lower back?\\
365 - You, uh,\\
366 - you do a lot of lifting?\\
367 - Of course you do.\\
368 - You're a maid and I'm an ass.\\
369 - I'm a housekeeper.\\
370 - Of course.\\
371 - And you're an ass.\\
372 - Yes.\\
373 - Hey, we don't you sit down? Let me take a look at it.\\
374 - What?\\
375 - I'm a chiropractor.\\
376 - Okay, but no funny business.\\
377 - Not to worry.\\
378 - Looks like you washed your hair instead of mine.\\
379 - I'm not in the mood, Jake.\\
380 - These clothes looks stupid.\\
381 - You're ten. No one cares.\\
382 - You're choking me.\\
383 - Trust me...\\
384 - you'll know when I'm choking you.\\
385 - I think my socks are on the wrong feet.\\
386 - Jake, dude...\\
387 - I'm right on the edge.\\
388 - Don't push me.\\
389 - I can't do this on someone else.\\
390 - Charlie!\\
391 - You look great, Rose.\\
392 - I don't think I can go through with this.\\
393 - What?\\
394 - No, sure you can.\\
395 - Oh, I'm going to call Andy and cancel.\\
396 - No, you're not.\\
397 - Now listen to me. You're a wonderful woman,\\
398 - and this guy Andy is going to love you.\\
399 - Thanks, but you're saying that just to get me out of your hair.\\
400 - No, not just.\\
401 - Now go out and have a great time.\\
402 - I... Shh!\\
403 - No good-byes.\\
404 - Just turn around and walk away.\\
405 - Okay.\\
406 - Good-bye.\\
407 - Good-bye, Rose.\\
408 - What happened?\\
409 - I have to go to the bathroom.\\
410 - Why did you take your clothes off?\\
411 - Sometimes I miss.\\
412 - Okay...\\
413 - that's it.\\
414 - I give up.\\
415 - You are a child, Jake.\\
416 - Dress, don't dress. Wash, don't wash.\\
417 - I don't care. You're on your own.\\
418 - What?\\
419 - ( moaning )\\
420 - Oh, God, that feels so good.\\
421 - Hey, Berta!\\
422 - I can't find my...\\
423 - Berta, if you're going to do a guy\\
424 - in the laundry room,\\
425 - put a scarf on the doorknob or something.\\
426 - Ah...\\
427 - I'm a big fan.\\
428 - Is Jake ready?\\
429 - Where's Jake?\\
430 - I don't know.\\
431 - You don't know? My, my wife just pulled in behind me.\\
432 - You said you'd have him ready.\\
433 - It can't be done.\\
434 - What do you mean, "It can't be done?"\\
435 - I'm not strong enough.\\
436 - His will is greater than mine.\\
437 - I'm just going to get drunk and stay out of his way.\\
438 - Please tell me he's ready.\\
439 - My parents are driving me nuts.\\
440 - Oh, well, um...\\
441 - Hi, Mom.\\
442 - Oh, don't you look handsome.\\
443 - Uncle Charlie's got my tie.\\
444 - Well, you don't need a tie.\\
445 - Grow up, Charlie.\\
446 - Bye!\\
447 - I thought you said he beat you.\\
448 - He did.\\
449 - Now he's just screwing with me.\\
450 - What happened with Berta?\\
451 - Well, it wasn't easy, but I did it.\\
452 - She won't do my laundry, or get my groceries,\\
453 - and I have to give her a lower back adjustment twice a week.\\
454 - And Steven Tyler thinks I'm doing her.\\
455 - But, but she is coming back?\\
456 - Yes, Charlie, she is coming back.\\
457 - Right on.\\
458 - Are you crying?\\
459 - It's been a very emotional day.\\
460 - Here you go, buddy. Drink your vodka.\\
461 - ( playing piano )\\
462 - ( knocking on window )\\
463 - ( sighs )\\
464 - You look great, Rose. I swear!\\
465 - He stood me up.\\
466 - What?\\
467 - After we spent all day getting ready?\\
468 - I don't know what I did wrong.\\
469 - You didn't do anything wrong.\\
470 - Then why did he stand me up?\\
471 - Because he's an idiot.\\
472 - He doesn't get what a truly rare person you are.\\
473 - Thanks... I wish Randy could see what you see.\\
474 - Forget about him. Come on.\\
475 - I'm going to take you to dinner.\\
476 - Really?\\
477 - Yeah, sure. Why not?\\
478 - Hey, uh...\\
479 - I thought you said his name was "Andy."\\
480 - What did I say?\\
481 - You said, "Randy."\\
482 - No, I didn't.\\
483 - Andy's a real guy. I didn't make him up.\\
484 - I love your little tie.
\subsection {Episode 05: The Last Thing You Want to Do Is Wind Up with a Hump}
1 - Never mix tequila and scotch.\\
2 - Morning, Uncle Charlie.\\
3 - Hey, Jake boy.\\
4 - Dad said you'd never get up to go to soccer with me\\
5 - but I said, yuh-huh, he promised.\\
6 - So, he was wrong. Ha ha.\\
7 - Yeah. Ha ha.\\
8 - Wait. What?\\
9 - Uh, you know, most of the parents wear shorts\\
10 - and lots of sun screen but that's another way to go.\\
11 - Alan, I can't go to a soccer game.\\
12 - I just got home from Vegas.\\
13 - You went out last night to return a video.\\
14 - Yeah, but I ran into a friend of mine\\
15 - who was getting married at the Bellagio.\\
16 - That explains the tuxedo.\\
17 - No, I think this was for something else entirely.\\
18 - Well, I'm sure I'll read about it in the paper.\\
19 - Anyway, I'm the soccer Snack Buddy this week\\
20 - so I got to stop at the grocery store.\\
21 - Why don't you ride to the game with Jake\\
22 - when the van gets here, huh?\\
23 - I've got a better idea.\\
24 - Why don't I go upstairs and throw up\\
25 - and sleep in my clothes for 12 hours.\\
26 - Fine. But if you're not going to come\\
27 - you got to tell Jake yourself.\\
28 - Fine.\\
29 - He'll understand.\\
30 - Hey, Jake.\\
31 - I got new cleats.\\
32 - Nice.\\
33 - Uh, listen, Jake, buddy...\\
34 - have you ever been to Vegas?\\
35 - ( excited shouting )\\
36 - So you're the infamous Uncle Charlie.\\
37 - I've heard about you.\\
38 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men *\\
39 - * Men... *\\
40 - Everybody out!\\
41 - Watch your head! One at a time!\\
42 - ( kids shouting )\\
43 - So, here's the deal, Uncle Charlie.\\
44 - I find you attractive.\\
45 - I have three kids, a bastard of an ex-husband,\\
46 - I work 50 hours a week running my own travel agency,\\
47 - I'm at the peak of my sexuality,\\
48 - and I have a three hour window Wednesday nights\\
49 - when the kids are at Tae Kwon Do.\\
50 - Are you in or out?\\
51 - I'm sorry.\\
52 - I-I'm terminally hung over\\
53 - and I just took a cleat in the groin.\\
54 - E-mail me.\\
55 - All Aboard Gloria at AOL dot com.\\
56 - ( shouting )\\
57 - ( whistle blowing )\\
58 - So, which one's yours?\\
59 - Oh, please don't make me talk.\\
60 - This is Charlie Harper. Alan Harper's brother.\\
61 - ( crows cheering and whistle blowing )\\
62 - So, who's winning?\\
63 - No one. We don't keep score.\\
64 - We think it's healthier\\
65 - if the kids just play for fun.\\
66 - You're yanking me, right?\\
67 - Yes, Judith warned us that you were a pistol.\\
68 - By the way, we were so sorry to hear about her and Alan.\\
69 - So tell us, is it true?\\
70 - Did Judith leave your brother for another woman?\\
71 - Why don't you ask Judith?\\
72 - We wouldn't want to pry.\\
73 - Ladies, if you'll excuse me, I have to go, 'cause...\\
74 - oh hell, I don't need a reason.\\
75 - Well, somebody's a little full of himself.\\
76 - Forget him. His brother's the one who's in play.\\
77 - How's Jake doing?\\
78 - Jake's fine. He's ten.\\
79 - He's got his whole life ahead of him.\\
80 - Me, on the other hand,\\
81 - I'm sitting in the hot sun in rented pants\\
82 - listening to myself blink.\\
83 - I'll ask somebody else.\\
84 - ( chuckling )\\
85 - What?\\
86 - Sorry, I couldn't help overhearing,\\
87 - and you just look so...\\
88 - pathetic.\\
89 - Really? The guy at the tux shop said I looked dashing.\\
90 - Of course,\\
91 - that was yesterday.\\
92 - And I found his phone number in my pocket.\\
93 - What was the occasion?\\
94 - Just returning a video.\\
95 - Charlie Harper.\\
96 - Kate McLaughlin.\\
97 - Let me ask you something, Kate McLaughlin.\\
98 - What's your take on this whole no keeping score thing?\\
99 - I think it's the dumbest thing I ever heard.\\
100 - Can I stay here next to you where it's safe?\\
101 - Sure.\\
102 - So, which one's yours?\\
103 - Number nine, but I'm not the father.\\
104 - Well, aren't you a good sport.\\
105 - Jake, for the last time, nobody got creamed.\\
106 - No one won, no one lost.\\
107 - Yeah, except for us. 12 to 2.\\
108 - Hey, pal, it doesn't matter if you win or lose.\\
109 - It's whether or not you beat the spread.\\
110 - Thank you, Charlie.\\
111 - Jake, go take a shower.\\
112 - Charlie, we're trying to teach the kids not to keep score.\\
113 - You should have thought of that before you taught them to count.\\
114 - By the way,\\
115 - what are you doing with Jake tomorrow?\\
116 - I don't know. Why?\\
117 - I made a play date for him\\
118 - with one of the kids from the game.\\
119 - You're hitting on the mother, aren't you?\\
120 - Can't slip one past you, can I?\\
121 - That's not what a play date is for.\\
122 - What? The kid plays, I have a date.\\
123 - Everybody wins.\\
124 - Everybody wins?\\
125 - Yes.\\
126 - But I promise not to keep score.\\
127 - Charlie, you can not use my son to pick up single mothers.\\
128 - Ah, but I can.\\
129 - Good night, Snack Buddy.\\
130 - No going in the water, no throwing rocks,\\
131 - and remember, if you can't see us, we can't see you.\\
132 - Is there anything you'd like to add, Charlie?\\
133 - Why can't they throw rocks?\\
134 - Go.\\
135 - Ernie loves the beach.\\
136 - Thanks for inviting him.\\
137 - Hey, anything for the kids.\\
138 - They're our future.\\
139 - So, where's Alan?\\
140 - I sent him to the movies.\\
141 - He deserves a break now and then,\\
142 - and I get some quality uncle time with Jake.\\
143 - I think that is really nice of...\\
144 - Ernie, keep your socks with your shoes!\\
145 - I'm sorry, where was I?\\
146 - You were saying I was nice about something.\\
147 - So, how long you been living\\
148 - in Sherman Oaks?\\
149 - Oh, gosh, we moved there in...\\
150 - Ernie, put that down, it's dead.\\
151 - I swear, that kid will pick up anything,\\
152 - no matter what it looks like.\\
153 - Been there.\\
154 - Anyway, we moved in just in time for the earthquake...\\
155 - Ernie, I'm not going to say it again,\\
156 - put the dead thing down!\\
157 - Jake, you should probably put your dead thing down, too.\\
158 - Kids, huh?\\
159 - I know, they're just...\\
160 - Ernie, put it down or we're leaving right now.\\
161 - I'm counting to three.\\
162 - One...\\
163 - two...\\
164 - Ernie, for God's sake, you're killing me here.\\
165 - Thank you.\\
166 - No problem.\\
167 - So, did you grow up in L.A.?\\
168 - No. My dad was in the army so we moved around...\\
169 - Oh, hell, that thing's not dead.\\
170 - Charlie, I would really like to get to know you\\
171 - but it is not going to happen on a play date.\\
172 - Why don't you ask me out some time?\\
173 - You know that's a real...\\
174 - ( Ernie crying )\\
175 - Are you happy?! Are you happy?!\\
176 - You had to pick it up again.\\
177 - Had to pick it up, didn't you.\\
178 - I told you to put it down, Ernie.\\
179 - So what night's good for you?\\
180 - Jake, don't pick it up.\\
181 - You saw what it did to Ernie.\\
182 - Don't wait up.\\
183 - Back to Vegas?\\
184 - Even better. Sherman Oaks.\\
185 - The gateway to Van Nuys.\\
186 - Kate again?\\
187 - Charlie, you have no clue what you're getting involved in\\
188 - with these divorced soccer moms.\\
189 - You're right, I don't have a clue.\\
190 - I've never had a clue. It's part of my charm.\\
191 - Well, at least keep in mind\\
192 - that all these women talk to each other.\\
193 - So anything you do will eventually get back to my wife\\
194 - and somehow become my fault.\\
195 - That doesn't seem fair.\\
196 - Oh, well.\\
197 - So, where are you going?\\
198 - I volunteered to help Gloria\\
199 - with the soccer league newsletter.\\
200 - I'm thinking of calling it "Just For Kicks."\\
201 - Wait a minute, this is the same Gloria who drives the kid van?\\
202 - Yeah. Why?\\
203 - Nothing. Have fun.\\
204 - Talk about not having a clue.\\
205 - And I designed a logo.\\
206 - The "K" in Kicks\\
207 - has a little foot.\\
208 - GLORIA: Sounds wonderful.\\
209 - I can't thank you enough for taking the time to do this.\\
210 - Oh, you know, anything for the kids.\\
211 - You're such a good father.\\
212 - It's a shame that Judith didn't appreciate you.\\
213 - Well, you know, she just needed a little time\\
214 - to sort things out, but...\\
215 - yeah, it's a shame.\\
216 - Look at you--\\
217 - a successful chiropractor, intelligent, dedicated.\\
218 - Aw, you're embarrassing me.\\
219 - ( chuckling )\\
220 - I'm sorry.\\
221 - Let's get back to your... little logo.\\
222 - Ow.\\
223 - What's wrong?\\
224 - Hmm? Oh, nothing.\\
225 - It's my neck. I must have slept wrong.\\
226 - Why don't you make an appointment with my office\\
227 - and we'll see if we can't fix that?\\
228 - No, no, I'd feel funny.\\
229 - We know each other.\\
230 - Don't be silly. It's what I do.\\
231 - Turn around, turn around.\\
232 - Go ahead.\\
233 - Are you getting enough calcium?\\
234 - I guess.\\
235 - It's really important for a woman your age.\\
236 - Osteoporosis is a real problem.\\
237 - Curvature of the spine.\\
238 - Last thing you want is to wind up with a hump.\\
239 - Knockee, knockee.\\
240 - Well, I hope you didn't start without me.\\
241 - BILL: What are you talking about?\\
242 - KATE: Bill, you did this on purpose.\\
243 - You showed late just so you could snoop on me.\\
244 - Hey, you got to meet my girlfriend.\\
245 - What meet? She was our baby-sitter.\\
246 - Will you get out of here, Bill?\\
247 - Kate, I'm trying.\\
248 - Ernie, would you put your shoes on?\\
249 - Hey.\\
250 - Hey.\\
251 - Bill.\\
252 - Charlie.\\
253 - That your Jag?\\
254 - Yeah.\\
255 - It's nice.\\
256 - I got the Navigator over there.\\
257 - That's nice, too.\\
258 - Let's go, Dad.\\
259 - Well, all right, then.\\
260 - You try and make her happy.\\
261 - ...truthfully, I think that my ex\\
262 - was intimidated by my sexual...\\
263 - I don't even know how to say it... appetite.\\
264 - Huh.\\
265 - So we're agreed we'll set aside six inches\\
266 - for the editorial column?\\
267 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
268 - Yes. Six inches.\\
269 - I don't know how I got so off-topic.\\
270 - I know exactly how you got off-topic.\\
271 - Okay. I think the next piece of business\\
272 - is to decide on the paper color.\\
273 - I brought some samples.\\
274 - We've got goldenrod, salmon, mustard...\\
275 - You had me at goldenrod.\\
276 - Everybody has you at goldenrod.\\
277 - My brother Alan warned me\\
278 - not to go out with you tonight.\\
279 - That's funny.\\
280 - Everybody warned me not to go out with you.\\
281 - Hey, it worked for Romeo and Juliet.\\
282 - Well, up until the poison and the stabbing.\\
283 - Charlie, I have a confession.\\
284 - I haven't been out with a man\\
285 - other than my husband in 12 years.\\
286 - Oh, that's not a problem.\\
287 - A couple of things have changed,\\
288 - but I can bring you up to date.\\
289 - Please do. All right, well...\\
290 - Nowadays women pay for dinner.\\
291 - And, of course, sex is a given.\\
292 - I'll tell you one thing, I am not paying for dinner.\\
293 - Rats.\\
294 - Well, look at the time.\\
295 - Maybe we should get going,\\
296 - give Gloria a chance for a little quiet time\\
297 - before her many, many kids come home.\\
298 - I don't need any quiet time.\\
299 - Don't be silly.\\
300 - Alan, would you mind driving me home?\\
301 - I'm feeling a little tipsy.\\
302 - A little tipsy?\\
303 - How about a little obvious?\\
304 - I'm sorry?\\
305 - Can I talk to you for a minute?\\
306 - You know, it is getting a little late.\\
307 - Sit down.\\
308 - We'll be right back.\\
309 - I think she's going through the change.\\
310 - What do you think you're doing?\\
311 - BROOKE: What? He's in play, I'm playing.\\
312 - GLORIA: I'm the one who told you he's in play.\\
313 - Oh, please. I told you two years ago that marriage was toast.\\
314 - So what?\\
315 - He's in my house on Tae Kwon Do Wednesday\\
316 - and I don't have time to mess around with you.\\
317 - Look, why don't we just let him decide?\\
318 - Let him decide?\\
319 - He still thinks we're doing a soccer newsletter.\\
320 - You don't even like him, do you?\\
321 - He's okay.\\
322 - He's here and it's Wednesday.\\
323 - Well, I happen to think he's hot.\\
324 - You wouldn't even know what to do with a hot guy.\\
325 - Oh, yeah? Watch me.\\
326 - Great, you broke him.\\
327 - The biggest surprise\\
328 - was how much I love having him around.\\
329 - I mean, Jake's amazing.\\
330 - Do you know I have on occasion\\
331 - actually put his needs ahead of my own?\\
332 - Like going to a soccer game at 8:00 a.m. on a Saturday?\\
333 - Yes.\\
334 - At 8:00 a.m. I can barely get out of bed\\
335 - to go to the bathroom.\\
336 - So what you're saying is having a child in your life\\
337 - totally changes the way that you look at things.\\
338 - Exactly.\\
339 - Of course you probably know that already.\\
340 - Yeah.\\
341 - But I like that you know it.\\
342 - I had a really great time.\\
343 - Me, too.\\
344 - Can we do this again?\\
345 - I would love that.\\
346 - Great.\\
347 - Whoa.\\
348 - ( cries )\\
349 - What happened?\\
350 - Did I do something wrong?\\
351 - Please don't tell Alan's wife.\\
352 - No, you didn't do anything wrong.\\
353 - I really like you.\\
354 - Okay, this is new for me.\\
355 - It's just...\\
356 - Charlie, I have a ten-year-old son.\\
357 - I have two mortgages, private school bills,\\
358 - a full-time job, custody battles,\\
359 - alimony battles, child support battles,\\
360 - carpools and drum lessons.\\
361 - How can we possibly do this again?\\
362 - You bought a ten-year-old a drum set?\\
363 - Don't change the subject, you know what I'm saying.\\
364 - I mean, do you really want to be involved in this?\\
365 - I hadn't really thought that far ahead.\\
366 - Exactly.\\
367 - All right, well, I guess\\
368 - I'll see you around.\\
369 - Where are you going?\\
370 - Home?\\
371 - Why?\\
372 - I mean, I said we couldn't do it again.\\
373 - That doesn't mean we can't do it tonight.\\
374 - Boy, you really don't have a clue, do you, Charlie?\\
375 - No.\\
376 - But it seems to be working for me.\\
377 - Morning.\\
378 - Hey.\\
379 - Regular or decaf?\\
380 - Regular.\\
381 - Thank God.\\
382 - Aren't you even curious?\\
383 - You went to Gloria's last night.\\
384 - Yeah.\\
385 - I can fill in the blanks.\\
386 - Man, we're getting killed.\\
387 - Hey, we're here for fun, right?\\
388 - Nobody wins or loses.\\
389 - Oh, come on.\\
390 - Somebody always loses.\\
391 - Who are we kidding?\\
392 - It's eight to one out there and everybody here knows it.\\
393 - And you know I'll tell you another thing.\\
394 - We haven't won a game all season\\
395 - and I'm putting that in the newsletter.\\
396 - And as God is my witness,\\
397 - there will be a newsletter.\\
398 - Dad, you're kind of freaking everybody out here.\\
399 - Forget it, Jake.\\
400 - It's Sherman Oaks.
\subsection {Episode 06: Did You Check With the Captain of the Flying Monkeys}
1 - ( cartoon music playing on TV )\\
2 - Hi. Hi, Uncle Charlie.\\
3 - How was your game?\\
4 - Ah, the musicians' softball league is a joke.\\
5 - Guys trying to catch stuff that isn't there.\\
6 - People throwing up on an easy double play ball.\\
7 - So why do you go?\\
8 - There's an open bar, and they let me pitch.\\
9 - Well, I've got to get dressed.\\
10 - Uh, I was going to throw this toast out,\\
11 - but it's yours if you want it.\\
12 - When did I become the family dog?\\
13 - Hey, Jake, what's this? A phone message?\\
14 - Yeah, some lady called for you.\\
15 - Who? I can't read your writing.\\
16 - "You're a big, selfish jerk."\\
17 - Okay, I know who this is.\\
18 - Amy.\\
19 - Probably Amy.\\
20 - Yep, Amy. She wants you to call her back.\\
21 - Yeah, that'll happen.\\
22 - Why not?\\
23 - Because I never said I'd call her back.\\
24 - Remember this, Jake.\\
25 - Never make promises to women that you don't intend to keep.\\
26 - And you know how you do that?\\
27 - Always keep my promises?\\
28 - That might work.\\
29 - A better way is never make promises.\\
30 - What happens if Amy calls again?\\
31 - Okay, I'm glad you asked that.\\
32 - When the phone rings at Uncle Charlie's house,\\
33 - we don't just willy-nilly pick up the receiver and answer it.\\
34 - No.\\
35 - What we do,\\
36 - is we check the caller ID.\\
37 - And only pick up if we want to talk to that person.\\
38 - Like Mom?\\
39 - That depends.\\
40 - Your mom, yes. My mom, no.\\
41 - How come you don't want to talk to your mom?\\
42 - I'll tell you all about that when you're old enough to drink.\\
43 - What if I want to talk to your mom?\\
44 - Okay, that kind of attitude\\
45 - is going to break down the whole system.\\
46 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men *\\
47 - * Men... *\\
48 - ( phone ringing )\\
49 - Dad, no, don't pick up the phone!\\
50 - Why not?\\
51 - It might be your mom.\\
52 - Or a woman.\\
53 - It's Amy again. She just won't give up.\\
54 - Charlie...\\
55 - Hey, look, I appreciate the need for privacy,\\
56 - but I think you're sending a bad message\\
57 - to my son about how to deal with women.\\
58 - How so?\\
59 - He thinks it's okay to avoid somebody\\
60 - just because the conversation might be uncomfortable.\\
61 - Charlie?\\
62 - Okay, that's not funny.\\
63 - Look, if I'm teaching the kid anything,\\
64 - it's honesty.\\
65 - Really?\\
66 - Walk me through the lesson, Charlie.\\
67 - Educate me.\\
68 - Okay.\\
69 - I tell women up front I'm not looking\\
70 - for a long-term relationship.\\
71 - Mm-hmm.\\
72 - If they don't believe me\\
73 - or they're determined to change my mind,\\
74 - I have a right to avoid that conversation.\\
75 - And the phone company obviously agrees with me,\\
76 - otherwise they wouldn't have invented Caller ID.\\
77 - Uncle Charlie, what if somebody you don't want to talk to\\
78 - comes over instead of calls?\\
79 - Tell them I'm not here.\\
80 - He's not here, Grandma!\\
81 - Mom, you just surprised me.\\
82 - You should have called first.\\
83 - Charlie, I call constantly.\\
84 - You screen like an Olympic drug tester.\\
85 - I'm happy to see you, Mom.\\
86 - I don't believe you, sweetheart,\\
87 - but at least you care enough to lie.\\
88 - Hey, I care enough to lie. You just caught me off-guard.\\
89 - So what are you doing here?\\
90 - Well, I'm showing a house up the beach,\\
91 - and I thought while I'm in the neighborhood,\\
92 - I would drop off a gift for my grandson.\\
93 - You're writing him a check?\\
94 - What kind of gift is that?\\
95 - You told me he likes Transformer toys.\\
96 - This check transforms into any toy he wants.\\
97 - Wow, thanks, Grandma.\\
98 - Is that all? Don't I get a hug?\\
99 - Oh, your grandma loves you\\
100 - so, so, so much.\\
101 - Oh! Grandma's got to go to work.\\
102 - Nobody just gives her checks.\\
103 - Walk me out.\\
104 - In case you're at all interested,\\
105 - I've been seeing a man,\\
106 - and he just may be the one.\\
107 - Hey, five time's a charm.\\
108 - Four.\\
109 - But what about the guy with the...?\\
110 - That was annulled. Oh.\\
111 - Oh, boy, are we going to have a new daddy?\\
112 - Oh, bite me, Charlie.\\
113 - Now I'd like to have a dinner at the house\\
114 - so you boys can meet him.\\
115 - What night is good for you?\\
116 - Uh, what night do you want us?\\
117 - Uh, uh, uh. I asked you first.\\
118 - ( both mumbling )\\
119 - ...check my calendar... ...don't really want to...\\
120 - Tomorrow night. 7:00.\\
121 - It's very important to me, and I hope you can make it.\\
122 - But I'll certainly understand\\
123 - if you're too busy for your mother.\\
124 - You know what she's trying to do, don't you?\\
125 - Of course I know.\\
126 - Then maybe one of us should go.\\
127 - Oh, sure, you go, I look bad.\\
128 - What do you care?\\
129 - I don't care. Then don't go.\\
130 - I'm not going. I'm not going either.\\
131 - I'm not staying.\\
132 - We'll eat, we'll go.\\
133 - No coffee, no dessert.\\
134 - We can't be rude.\\
135 - Watch me. I refuse to let that woman...\\
136 - Hi, Mom.\\
137 - Better late than never.\\
138 - We're right on time.\\
139 - I was referring to the big picture.\\
140 - Hey, Grandma.\\
141 - And look, you've brought Jake to meet my new beau.\\
142 - Come here, sweetheart.\\
143 - Now tonight, you and I are going to play a game,\\
144 - and the name of the game is...\\
145 - "Don't call me Grandma."\\
146 - What kind of game is that?\\
147 - It's a fun game, honey.\\
148 - It only has one rule: you have to call me "Evelyn."\\
149 - Okay.\\
150 - Try it.\\
151 - Evelyn.\\
152 - See? We're having fun already.\\
153 - Oh, look, you didn't bring wine.\\
154 - Good. Too many people bring wine.\\
155 - Tommy, darling.\\
156 - I'd like you to meet my sons.\\
157 - This is Charlie.\\
158 - Hello. Hi, Tommy, how are you?\\
159 - Alan.\\
160 - Hello. Alan.\\
161 - And this is Jake.\\
162 - Yes, I am, Evelyn.\\
163 - Let's not beat it to death, okay?\\
164 - Good to meet you, Jake.\\
165 - Oh!\\
166 - There you are.\\
167 - Boys, this is Tommy's daughter, Olivia.\\
168 - Hey, hello, Charlie.\\
169 - Hey, there... stranger.\\
170 - You two know each other?\\
171 - I thought I knew him.\\
172 - Oh, no.\\
173 - Okay, who'd like a drink?\\
174 - I would like a drink.\\
175 - Charlie, come help me with drinks.\\
176 - Alan, talk to Olivia.\\
177 - Alan was a cesarean.\\
178 - Oh.\\
179 - It-it wasn't, uh, medically necessary.\\
180 - She just... had a function to go to.\\
181 - Is there anyone\\
182 - in the 310 area code that you have not mounted?\\
183 - Come on, we went out a couple of times.\\
184 - She assumed it was an exclusive thing,\\
185 - and when she found out it wasn't,\\
186 - she got a little upset.\\
187 - Anyway, Tommy seems like a real nice guy.\\
188 - I'm very happy for you. Good night.\\
189 - Charles...\\
190 - you are not going anywhere.\\
191 - This man is very important to me.\\
192 - No we are going to have a nice dinner,\\
193 - you are going to be charming,\\
194 - and Tommy will remain oblivious to the fact\\
195 - that you've defiled his daughter.\\
196 - Hey, she wasn't exactly "filed" when I met her.\\
197 - You don't know how lucky you are\\
198 - to have a mother like Evelyn.\\
199 - She is the warmest, most affectionate,\\
200 - giving woman I've ever know.\\
201 - That's my mom.\\
202 - Call her "Evelyn."\\
203 - That's the game.\\
204 - You play your game; I'll play mine.\\
205 - Here we are.\\
206 - There's my little karaoke cupcake.\\
207 - Oh, Tommy, you are not telling that story!\\
208 - We took one of those little cruises to Alaska,\\
209 - glaciers and whales-- I didn't quite see\\
210 - the point of it all-- but during the evening,\\
211 - there was this karaoke competition.\\
212 - And as you know, I'm no stranger to the stage.\\
213 - Yes, Mom, I know.\\
214 - Excuse me.\\
215 - Uh, anyway, you know how I've always sung, um,\\
216 - "These Boots Are Made For Walking"?\\
217 - With my little dance routine.\\
218 - Yes, Mom, I-I have it on my wedding video.\\
219 - So how have you been?\\
220 - Um, you know...\\
221 - No, I don't.\\
222 - When people don't return your calls,\\
223 - it's kind of hard to know how they've been.\\
224 - Okay, look, I know this is an awkward coincidence...\\
225 - It's no coincidence.\\
226 - When my father told me who he was dating,\\
227 - I made it a point to be here.\\
228 - Oh...\\
229 - well, you can't argue the awkward part.\\
230 - So I'm zipping up my boots, I am about to go onstage,\\
231 - when this hausfrau from Tone-Deaf Texas\\
232 - gets up and starts\\
233 - singing my song.\\
234 - Well, I think you could imagine how unhappy I was.\\
235 - OLIVIA: Don't tell me to calm down!\\
236 - You lied to me.\\
237 - I did not lie to you.\\
238 - And you could have told me this on the phone.\\
239 - Your never answer your phone.\\
240 - Of course not.\\
241 - Who wants to have this conversation?\\
242 - So, um, uh, I, uh, I sidled up to the woman\\
243 - and-and really very smoothly, turned it into a duet.\\
244 - When suddenly,\\
245 - she starts pushing me...\\
246 - OLIVIA: You said I was very special\\
247 - to you.\\
248 - You were.\\
249 - Yeah. Me and three other women.\\
250 - I said you were special. Not unique.\\
251 - Drop dead, you bastard!\\
252 - E-Excuse me.\\
253 - In my defense...\\
254 - Ah, screw it.\\
255 - Finish the story, Evelyn.\\
256 - Did you push her back?\\
257 - Stupid musicians' league.\\
258 - I don't know why I bother.\\
259 - Get this: tie score, we're down to our last out.\\
260 - Our best hitter, Billy Kresky, is up.\\
261 - The bases are loaded.\\
262 - So is Kresky.\\
263 - His whole family is standing behind the backstop,\\
264 - crying and pleading, "Go back to rehab, Daddy!\\
265 - We love you!"\\
266 - Needless to say, he choked.\\
267 - Charlie, I think we've got a bigger problem.\\
268 - Our mother is missing.\\
269 - Oh, don't try to cheer me up.\\
270 - I'm serious.\\
271 - I called her home, her car, her cell. Nothing.\\
272 - Did you check with the captain of the flying monkeys?\\
273 - Charlie...\\
274 - She's probably just sulking\\
275 - because I screwed up her dinner party last week.\\
276 - That's what I thought, too, except I called her office,\\
277 - and they haven't heard from her either.\\
278 - Okay, that's weird.\\
279 - Yeah, I think somebody needs to go over there\\
280 - and make sure she's okay.\\
281 - Good idea.\\
282 - You do that,\\
283 - and I'll stay here in case she calls.\\
284 - Wh-Why don't you go,\\
285 - and I'll stay here in case she calls?\\
286 - No, I got to be honest. I like my idea better.\\
287 - Well, I'm not going there alone.\\
288 - I'm not going at all!\\
289 - What do you want to bet she ran off to Vegas\\
290 - to marry this Tommy guy.\\
291 - Hey, i-if that's all this is, great.\\
292 - The only downside would be\\
293 - that you slept with our stepsister.\\
294 - Huh. I hadn't thought of that.\\
295 - Kind of sexy.\\
296 - Kind of sick.\\
297 - I'm saying.\\
298 - Look, there's no one here.\\
299 - Let's go.\\
300 - No, no, I want to take a look.\\
301 - You have a key?\\
302 - I'm the good son.\\
303 - ALAN: Mom?\\
304 - Okay, she's not here. Let's go.\\
305 - Okay, she's here. Let's go.\\
306 - Charlie, wait a minute.\\
307 - Mom,\\
308 - are you all right?\\
309 - Why-why haven't you been answering the phone?\\
310 - I didn't want to burden anyone\\
311 - with my grief over the late Tommy Pearson.\\
312 - Tommy died?\\
313 - Well...\\
314 - he's dead to me.\\
315 - Okay. What happened?\\
316 - He dumped me.\\
317 - Mom, I'm sorry, but the thing between me and his daughter\\
318 - happened years before you even met the guy.\\
319 - This has nothing to do with you, Charlie.\\
320 - God, you're a narcissist.\\
321 - No, Tommy left me for some fresh-faced 45-year-old bimbo.\\
322 - Yeah, I'm sorry, Mom.\\
323 - I-I know he meant a lot to you.\\
324 - Yeah, I-I'm sorry, too.\\
325 - Thank you, Alan. Nice try, Charlie.\\
326 - Now, if you'll both please leave,\\
327 - I'd like to be alone.\\
328 - We understand.\\
329 - Charlie, wait.\\
330 - We can't just leave her here.\\
331 - Fine. Where do you want to leave her?\\
332 - Hey, Mom, why don't you, uh,\\
333 - why don't you come back and stay at Charlie's house\\
334 - for a few days? How's that?\\
335 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, time out.\\
336 - Don't worry, Charlie.\\
337 - I have no desire to impose on your life.\\
338 - Appreciate it. All right, then, chin up.\\
339 - You sure, Mom?\\
340 - Yes. Thank you, Alan.\\
341 - Okay.\\
342 - Oh, God...\\
343 - ( quietly ): So close.\\
344 - How long is she going to sit out there?\\
345 - I don't know.\\
346 - I've never seen her this depressed.\\
347 - Somebody's got to go out there\\
348 - and show her a little love and support.\\
349 - Jake?\\
350 - Um, w-why don't you go out and talk to Grandma?\\
351 - Why?\\
352 - 'Cause she's a little lonely.\\
353 - She's your mom.\\
354 - Don't sass me. Go talk to Grandma.\\
355 - Hi, Evelyn.\\
356 - Oh, please, call me Grandma.\\
357 - Well, what about the game?\\
358 - Games are for children, Jake.\\
359 - You know, Uncle Charlie got me a metal detector,\\
360 - and sometimes I find cool stuff on the beach.\\
361 - That's nice, but you know,\\
362 - that cool stuff is stuff that other people lost\\
363 - and will never get back.\\
364 - Trinkets and treasures\\
365 - buried beneath the lonely sands of time.\\
366 - Yeah, but finders, keepers, right?\\
367 - And losers, weepers.\\
368 - He's getting killed out there.\\
369 - Well...\\
370 - he's not crying yet.\\
371 - Somebody needs to go out there and back him up.\\
372 - Ten bucks says it's not me.\\
373 - Hey, what's going on with you two...?\\
374 - Kid's got a bladder the size of a pea.\\
375 - You were a bed wetter, if I recall.\\
376 - You know... you know what-what\\
377 - Jake would-would really get a kick out of?\\
378 - If you could sing while Charlie played the piano, huh?\\
379 - Oh, oh, no, Alan. I couldn't.\\
380 - Besides, Charlie always hated that.\\
381 - Are you kidding? It was his idea!\\
382 - ( laughs )\\
383 - ( playing lively intro )\\
384 - EVELYN: * These boots are made for walkin' *\\
385 - * And that's just what they'll do *\\
386 - * One of these days these boots are gonna... *\\
387 - ( playing slowly )\\
388 - Pick it up, Charlie.\\
389 - We're walking, not crawling.\\
390 - Are you ready, boots?\\
391 - ( playing jazzy riff )\\
392 - Okay, now.\\
393 - One more time!\\
394 - EVELYN: A-one, two.\\
395 - One, two, three.\\
396 - * You keep sayin' you got... *\\
397 - Mom? You okay?\\
398 - Oh, go back to bed, Charlie.\\
399 - No, I'm up.\\
400 - Hard to sleep after a big show.\\
401 - Thank you for that.\\
402 - It brought back some nice memories.\\
403 - You still got some chops, Mom.\\
404 - You were rushing the tempo towards the end there.\\
405 - Sorry. I always get a little carried away\\
406 - when you do the James Brown medley.\\
407 - Oh, Charlie.\\
408 - Your mother's a real sad case, isn't she?\\
409 - Oh, you'll get over him.\\
410 - There's other guys.\\
411 - He never even called.\\
412 - He never even said good-bye.\\
413 - Maybe... maybe he was scared.\\
414 - Of what?\\
415 - I knew there were no promises, no strings.\\
416 - That-that doesn't mean there can't be common courtesy.\\
417 - Huh.\\
418 - To think I meant that little to him.\\
419 - It'll be okay, Mom.\\
420 - Hey, you still got me and Alan.\\
421 - Oh, Charlie, please.\\
422 - I know how difficult things are between us.\\
423 - Maybe it's my fault.\\
424 - It's not all your fault.\\
425 - I-I probably haven't been the best son.\\
426 - ( sighs )\\
427 - I just want you to know that\\
428 - in my way, I want you to be happy, and...\\
429 - ...I love you.\\
430 - Well, I guess I'll go pack.\\
431 - Why?\\
432 - Oh, I'm going home.\\
433 - In the middle of the night?\\
434 - Charlie, you just said you loved me.\\
435 - You could only screw it up from here.\\
436 - ( playing "Love Me Tender" on piano )\\
437 - * Oh, my darling, I love you\\
438 - * And I always will.\\
439 - ( playing final notes )\\
440 - Donkey Kong!\\
441 - "Danke Schoen."\\
442 - "Danke Schoen!"\\
443 - "Danke Schoen." B flat.\\
444 - One, two...

1 - My dad doesn't. His stuff's in the garage.\\
2 - You know how to play Vampire Hunter?\\
3 - 'Cause I just got it.\\
4 - No, sorry.\\
5 - You got to chop off their heads.\\
6 - Otherwise, they'll keep coming at you.\\
7 - Do you know where your uncle keeps the paper towels?\\
8 - I think there's some up there.\\
9 - Whoa.\\
10 - Whoa.\\
11 - Hi.\\
12 - You must be Alan.\\
13 - I'm Cindy.\\
14 - Hi.\\
15 - Uh, hey, uh, Jake, it's, uh,\\
16 - it's time to get dressed.\\
17 - Wait a minute.\\
18 - Can you get me a bowl from that top shelf?\\
19 - Come on. Let's go. Let's go.\\
20 - What happened to\\
21 - "Breakfast is the most important meal of the day"?\\
22 - Just go get dressed.\\
23 - Charlie, there is a half-naked woman\\
24 - in our kitchen.\\
25 - Which half?\\
26 - Hey, Cindy.\\
27 - Hey, Charlie.\\
28 - How you doing?\\
29 - Not bad. How about yourself?\\
30 - Pretty good.\\
31 - Thanks again.\\
32 - I'll, uh, I'll see you soon.\\
33 - Any time.\\
34 - Bye.\\
35 - "How you doing?"\\
36 - "Thanks again?"\\
37 - Charlie, casual sex is one thing,\\
38 - but this is just lazy.\\
39 - What are you talking about?\\
40 - I didn't have sex with her.\\
41 - She just surfs out on the point\\
42 - and uses my shower and goes to work.\\
43 - So, you're not sleeping with her?\\
44 - Geez, Alan, I don't sleep with every buff surfer chick\\
45 - that uses my shower.\\
46 - What kind of a guy do you think I am?\\
47 - I think you're the luckiest bastard\\
48 - to walk the face of the earth, but...\\
49 - that's not my point.\\
50 - I-I don't want women\\
51 - flashing their butt tattoos at my son.\\
52 - Cindy has a tattoo?\\
53 - Yes, a-a butterfly.\\
54 - Huh. Right cheek or left?\\
55 - No, wait. Don't tell me.\\
56 - I want to be surprised.\\
57 - So, you're not sleeping with her, but you want to.\\
58 - Well, yeah.\\
59 - What kind of guy do you think I am?\\
60 - Charlie, when I moved in here,\\
61 - I said that it was vital\\
62 - that we create a wholesome atmosphere for Jake,\\
63 - and you said, "I understand."\\
64 - Alan, there's something you should know about me.\\
65 - When I say, "I understand," it doesn't mean I agree.\\
66 - It doesn't mean I understand.\\
67 - It doesn't even mean I'm listening.\\
68 - Then why do you say it?\\
69 - It seems to make people happy, and that's what I'm all about.\\
70 - Well, that's very altruistic,\\
71 - but I-I would prefer\\
72 - if you'd just be straight with me.\\
73 - Fine.\\
74 - All I'm asking is that you keep in mind\\
75 - that we have an impressionable, ten-year-old boy living here.\\
76 - I understand.\\
77 - Thank you.\\
78 - * Men... *\\
79 - ( playing jazz on piano )\\
80 - That sounds nice.\\
81 - Thanks.\\
82 - So, where are Jake and Alan today?\\
83 - Uh, Jake's at school, and Alan's at work.\\
84 - It's just you and me.\\
85 - Well, tell them I said hi.\\
86 - Thanks again for the shower.\\
87 - You bet. You look really nice.\\
88 - Thank you. Bye.\\
89 - Yeah, I got work to do.\\
90 - Oh,\\
91 - Charlie.\\
92 - Seeing you strike out like that just makes me love you more.\\
93 - Rose, you've got to get a hobby.\\
94 - Oh, I've got a hobby.\\
95 - I thought we agreed we were just friends.\\
96 - We are.\\
97 - We're friends who slept together once,\\
98 - and then one friend never called the other friend,\\
99 - but luckily, the other friend forgave him.\\
100 - Where are you going?\\
101 - To make my friend a grilled cheese sandwich.\\
102 - Rose, Rose,\\
103 - I don't want a grilled cheese sandwich.\\
104 - Would you prefer a quesadilla?\\
105 - That sounds nice.\\
106 - ( doorbell rings )\\
107 - But then you have to leave.\\
108 - Hey, Judith.\\
109 - Alan's at work.\\
110 - I know where Alan is.\\
111 - I came to talk to you.\\
112 - Me? But you don't like me.\\
113 - I don't.\\
114 - I like you.\\
115 - Jake's fourth grade class was given a simple assignment--\\
116 - "Draw something interesting\\
117 - you see around the house."\\
118 - One child drew a record player.\\
119 - Another drew a parrot.\\
120 - My son drew this.\\
121 - A woman's behind with a butterfly tattoo.\\
122 - On the right cheek.\\
123 - I'll have to just act surprised.\\
124 - I asked him where he saw this.\\
125 - He said, "In Uncle Charlie's kitchen."\\
126 - Well, you got to admit,\\
127 - it beats the hell out of a parrot.\\
128 - Charlie, I am not in the mood.\\
129 - ( phone ringing ) Hold that thought.\\
130 - I got it.\\
131 - Hello.\\
132 - Are you in for your mother?\\
133 - Uh...\\
134 - Charlie's in a meeting right now,\\
135 - but you can talk to me.\\
136 - Heck, I feel like we're practically related.\\
137 - Is that the girl in the picture?\\
138 - Rose? No.\\
139 - She doesn't have a tattoo on her butt.\\
140 - I'm guessing.\\
141 - Look, I don't care what you do in your private time,\\
142 - but when my son is here,\\
143 - I expect you to clean up your act.\\
144 - I understand.\\
145 - I don't like coming over here and being the bad guy,\\
146 - but I have to protect my son.\\
147 - I understand.\\
148 - It's hard enough going through this transition\\
149 - all by myself.\\
150 - Alan at least has you.\\
151 - I have no one.\\
152 - Except my parents, and they're completely toxic.\\
153 - I understand.\\
154 - Do you?\\
155 - I think I do.\\
156 - Thank you.\\
157 - That means a lot to me.\\
158 - I mean, I've always been the good daughter\\
159 - or the good wife.\\
160 - And you know what?\\
161 - Outside of those relationships, I don't know who I am.\\
162 - Am I gay? Am I straight?\\
163 - Who the hell knows?\\
164 - I'm scared about this, Charlie, and I'm...\\
165 - totally alone.\\
166 - Well...\\
167 - you know what?\\
168 - I understand.\\
169 - Thank you for listening.\\
170 - Hey.\\
171 - I'm so sorry to take up your time\\
172 - with all of this.\\
173 - Hey...\\
174 - I understand.\\
175 - Oh.\\
176 - Thank you, Charlie.\\
177 - You're welcome.\\
178 - There's five minutes of my life I'll never get back.\\
179 - Don't fill up.\\
180 - Your mom's taking us out for lunch.\\
181 - Hey, where have you been?\\
182 - I just had lunch with my mother and my stalker.\\
183 - They spent the afternoon eating off each other's plates\\
184 - and discussing my fear of intimacy.\\
185 - You do have that, you know.\\
186 - Anyway, look, can we talk\\
187 - about this picture Jake drew?\\
188 - What's to talk about?\\
189 - He's a boy.\\
190 - He saw a woman's ass.\\
191 - He liked it.\\
192 - Thank your lucky stars it wasn't the cable guy's ass\\
193 - and move on.\\
194 - Hey, Dad, where's Can-kun?\\
195 - Cancun?\\
196 - No, it's spelled Can-kun.\\
197 - It's in Mexico. Why?\\
198 - We should go there for Christmas\\
199 - instead of Aunt Betty's.\\
200 - What are you reading?\\
201 - Sports Illustrated.\\
202 - But there's mostly ladies in bathing suits.\\
203 - Jake?\\
204 - Jake? Come back here.\\
205 - Are you happy?\\
206 - I have my moments,\\
207 - but they're becoming further apart.\\
208 - Jake, sit down, sit down.\\
209 - Am I in trouble?\\
210 - No, no. It's, uh, it's, uh, it's perfectly natural\\
211 - for you to be interested in women's bodies.\\
212 - Great. I'll be in my room.\\
213 - Wait.\\
214 - Let's-let's-let's talk a minute here.\\
215 - I-I don't mind you looking at these pictures,\\
216 - but it-it's important that you know what they mean.\\
217 - Ooh.\\
218 - I'd like to know that, too, Alan.\\
219 - Okay, first of all,\\
220 - real women don't look like this.\\
221 - These pictures have been retouched\\
222 - and airbrushed so that the women look\\
223 - like they're perfect,\\
224 - but they're really not.\\
225 - Uh, excuse me, but I meant that one,\\
226 - and she was perfect.\\
227 - What I'm trying to explain to Jake is\\
228 - that this is not what regular women look like.\\
229 - Then why don't they use regular women?\\
230 - Because the only way\\
231 - regular women can sell magazines\\
232 - is door-to-door.\\
233 - My point is,\\
234 - it that these women are-are three-dimensional human beings.\\
235 - They're-they're not just sex objects.\\
236 - Which explains why this one's on all fours in the surf.\\
237 - Are you quite done?\\
238 - No. I think you're being very unfair.\\
239 - These women worked very hard, ate very little,\\
240 - and spent a lot of money to become sex objects.\\
241 - Those breasts alone cost ten grand.\\
242 - You can buy these?\\
243 - Thank you, Charlie.\\
244 - Some women choose to, uh...\\
245 - uh, to make their breasts larger,\\
246 - uh, with, uh, with what's called,\\
247 - uh, surgical implants.\\
248 - Why?\\
249 - Oh, well, they think bigger is better.\\
250 - I can see that.\\
251 - But what really matters, Jake, is-is what's inside a person.\\
252 - See, that's the lesson here.\\
253 - Do you get what I'm saying?\\
254 - I think so.\\
255 - You sure?\\
256 - There's nothing to be embarrassed about.\\
257 - I mean, do you, uh...\\
258 - Do you have any questions?\\
259 - Just one.\\
260 - Fire away.\\
261 - Can I have my magazine back?\\
262 - Congratulations, Alan.\\
263 - You've managed to take the fun out of boobs.\\
264 - ( phone ringing )\\
265 - Hello?\\
266 - Oh, hi. Hi, Judith.\\
267 - Yeah, I'm-I'm so glad you called.\\
268 - I-I just... What?\\
269 - She wants to talk to you.\\
270 - Why does my wife want to talk to you?\\
271 - I don't know.\\
272 - Hey, Judith, what's up?\\
273 - Uh-huh.\\
274 - I understand.\\
275 - What do you understand?\\
276 - Not a thing.\\
277 - I understand.\\
278 - What's she saying?\\
279 - Hang on, Judith.\\
280 - That's my other line.\\
281 - She's upset because her parents want\\
282 - to take Jake to Sea World,\\
283 - and she feels like this is crossing a boundary,\\
284 - since they've been so unsupportive recently,\\
285 - and she's not sure if her anger is misplaced.\\
286 - Since when are you her new best friend?\\
287 - I don't know.\\
288 - Something's gone horribly wrong.\\
289 - Sorry. Uh, you were saying?\\
290 - I understand.\\
291 - "You're the coolest."?\\
292 - "Love, Cindy."?\\
293 - Are you sure your nephew's going to like this?\\
294 - Who says it's for my nephew?\\
295 - You're really cute.\\
296 - Good.\\
297 - I'm sorry there's no waves.\\
298 - Yeah. I don't know how I'm going to get my exercise today.\\
299 - Oh, that's a puzzler.\\
300 - ( doorbell ringing )\\
301 - Why don't you open up another bottle of wine,\\
302 - and we'll figure something out?\\
303 - Okay.\\
304 - I'm sorry to just drop by, but I had to talk to somebody.\\
305 - I just left Jake with my parents\\
306 - so they could take him to San Diego,\\
307 - and I got in this terrible argument with my father.\\
308 - He thinks it's my fault\\
309 - that Alan and I are breaking up.\\
310 - And he knows exactly how to push my buttons.\\
311 - The question is, why do I need his approval?\\
312 - Why do I need approval from any man?\\
313 - Uh...\\
314 - I understand.\\
315 - Charlie, how could you possibly understand?\\
316 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
317 - I didn't realize you had company.\\
318 - No. We were just hanging up.\\
319 - I'm-I'm Cindy.\\
320 - Oh, hi. Judith. Hi.\\
321 - You know, I've spent the better part of my life\\
322 - trying to win my father's approval.\\
323 - Oh, you, too, huh?\\
324 - Yeah. I almost married a guy\\
325 - just 'cause my father liked him.\\
326 - I married a guy just like my father.\\
327 - Oh, disaster, right?\\
328 - Mm. It's his brother.\\
329 - Oh. I met him.\\
330 - He's pretty tightly wound.\\
331 - JUDITH: He is.\\
332 - Yeah. Do you want some wine?\\
333 - I want a lot of wine.\\
334 - Yeah.\\
335 - You know it's so funny about relationships\\
336 - and men-- you just wonder all the time.\\
337 - Always, always.\\
338 - I do not understand.\\
339 - * Men.\\
340 - ( sighs )\\
341 - Morning, neighbor.\\
342 - Oh, he's not up yet, Rose.\\
343 - Oh, Alan, don't you think I know that?\\
344 - I brought a Frisbee for your son.\\
345 - It's a glow-in- the-dark pro model.\\
346 - There are teeth marks in it.\\
347 - They're not mine.\\
348 - Um, actually, Jake's in San Diego\\
349 - with his mom's parents.\\
350 - Boy, that hardly seems fair.\\
351 - Evelyn never gets any quality time with him.\\
352 - Evelyn?\\
353 - Your mom?\\
354 - I know her name.\\
355 - But do you know how much she loves you\\
356 - and would appreciate a call once in a while?\\
357 - Hi, Alan.\\
358 - Shower open?\\
359 - Uh, yeah, help yourself.\\
360 - Hi, Alan.\\
361 - Judith, what are you doing here?\\
362 - Cindy's teaching me to surf. She says I'm a natural.\\
363 - She's got the upper body strength for it.\\
364 - Nothing like yours...\\
365 - Well, you will,\\
366 - you just you got to build up your lats.\\
367 - Wow, they're so firm.\\
368 - Come on.\\
369 - I'll show you some exercises\\
370 - before we hit the shower.\\
371 - So when's Charlie getting up?\\
372 - In about nine seconds.\\
373 - Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!\\
374 - What? I was having a great dream.\\
375 - Your girlfriend and my wife.\\
376 - Surfing, showering, rubber suits.\\
377 - Okay, this might be better.\\
378 - Charlie, Charlie, you've got to do something.\\
379 - You're right.\\
380 - Charlie, what are you going to do?\\
381 - What do you think? I just woke up.\\
382 - Come on. Come on.\\
383 - They could be lathering each other up right now!\\
384 - Alan, you're not helping this go any faster.\\
385 - I can't believe this is going on under my own roof.\\
386 - Well, under your roof.\\
387 - God knows what's going on under my roof.\\
388 - ( toilet flushes )\\
389 - You know, there is good news here.\\
390 - Oh, really? What's that?\\
391 - Now we know why I never got anywhere with Cindy.\\
392 - Hello?! Me!\\
393 - Okay, listen...\\
394 - What do we really know here?\\
395 - Your wife is taking up surfing.\\
396 - We're good so far, right?\\
397 - Uh-huh.\\
398 - She made a new friend. Still good?\\
399 - Yeah, I guess.\\
400 - Do we know for a fact that they're showering together?\\
401 - No...\\
402 - Okay, so what do we know for sure about Cindy and Judith?\\
403 - Cindy's not interested in you, and Judith thinks she's gay.\\
404 - Oh.\\
405 - Well, there you go.\\
406 - ...and I got to see penguins, and a manta ray,\\
407 - and I got to pet a shark,\\
408 - and the coolest thing was the whales.\\
409 - They splash everybody.\\
410 - You could see right through this one lady's shirt.\\
411 - And I think maybe she had plants.\\
412 - Implants.\\
413 - Yeah, implants.\\
414 - I asked Grandma if she had them, and Grandpa said, "I wish."\\
415 - And then she got mad at him,\\
416 - and then they bought me ice cream.\\
417 - So, you, uh,\\
418 - you had a good trip?\\
419 - Yeah, when I got home I went to the moves with Mom and Cindy.\\
420 - Oh, wait, wait, wait, uh, uh, you, Mom, and, and Cindy?\\
421 - There you go.\\
422 - She's going to teach me to surf.\\
423 - Of course she is.\\
424 - She's not going to be happy\\
425 - until the whole damn family surfs.\\
426 - Why don't we give her Aunt Betty's number?\\
427 - Squeeze that fat ass into a wet suit.\\
428 - Uh, here, Jake, take your pizza\\
429 - and go watch TV in your room.\\
430 - Dad said "Fat ass."\\
431 - You've seen Aunt Betty.\\
432 - It's not swearing if it's true.\\
433 - Now, go.\\
434 - She gets all bent out of shape\\
435 - when Cindy's prancing around here\\
436 - with her butterfly butt sticking out.\\
437 - But all of a sudden, it's okay.\\
438 - 'Cause the butt is on the other foot.\\
439 - Alan, chill out, buddy.\\
440 - No, no, this is the worst kind of hypocrisy,\\
441 - and it will not stand.\\
442 - Forgive me, Alan, but that self-righteous attitude\\
443 - is a big part of what drove Judith away in the first place.\\
444 - What, what, where did you get? Did she tell you that?\\
445 - Girlfriends tell each other everything.\\
446 - Don't look at me like that.\\
447 - Listen...\\
448 - if she really is gay,\\
449 - then there's nothing you can do about it,\\
450 - except maybe try and figure out\\
451 - But, but if she's just experimenting,\\
452 - and you act all loving and supportive,\\
453 - then maybe, maybe she comes back to the home team.\\
454 - Huh.\\
455 - Or maybe I could find it in my heart\\
456 - to actually be loving and supportive.\\
457 - Well, sure, if you want to reinvent the wheel.\\
458 - Uh, you know, I would have been\\
459 - more than happy to drive Jake to your house.\\
460 - Oh, no problem. This worked out great.\\
461 - I've been surfing all day with Cindy,\\
462 - and we just had a bite to eat.\\
463 - Isn't that nice?\\
464 - Uh, listen, are you in a hurry?\\
465 - Because there's something I wanted to talk to you about.\\
466 - No, I guess not. What's up?\\
467 - Um... I just wanted to...\\
468 - to, to let you know that...\\
469 - I'm okay with this.\\
470 - Uh, more than okay.\\
471 - Uh, I, I understand uh, love and respect you\\
472 - for your courage, uh, uh, to explore things.\\
473 - Thank you, I'm really starting to enjoy it.\\
474 - And I support that, um...\\
475 - Yeah, I've only done it on my knees so far,\\
476 - but Cindy says I'm almost ready to try it standing up.\\
477 - You know what?\\
478 - I don't need to hear the details.\\
479 - The more important thing is\\
480 - that, that I accept you and Cindy as lovers,\\
481 - and, and, and more power to you,\\
482 - sister.\\
483 - You pompous assuming bastard.\\
484 - Uh-oh.\\
485 - You think I'm sleeping with her?\\
486 - No... no.\\
487 - I just got out of a 12-year marriage,\\
488 - and you think I would jump into bed\\
489 - with someone I just met?\\
490 - Man or woman?\\
491 - No, no...\\
492 - You should be ashamed of yourself.\\
493 - I am. I am.\\
494 - Two women become friends,\\
495 - and you jump to the conclusion they're having sex?\\
496 - Where do you get that kind of sleazy thinking?\\
497 - The jogger. The one on the left.\\
498 - Real?\\
499 - Good eye.\\
500 - With the sports bra, it could have gone either way.\\
501 - Of course, if they do go either way, they're usually fake.\\
502 - Jake, honey, get your stuff. We're going home.\\
503 - Okay, see you, Uncle Charlie.\\
504 - See you, buddy.\\
505 - Hey, girlfriend.\\
506 - Don't "girlfriend" me, you shallow piece of crap.\\
507 - Uh-oh.\\
508 - Fake.\\
509 - Real.\\
510 - Jake.\\
511 - Who does she think she's kidding with those things?\\
512 - Jake, I swear, if you don't stop,\\
513 - I'm taking you home.\\
514 - I understand.
\subsection {Episode 08: Twenty-Five Little Pre-Pubers Without a Snootful}
1 - Right on. Good location.\\
2 - What else?\\
3 - That's the sink.\\
4 - Uh-huh.\\
5 - If you put your thumb over the hole,\\
6 - you can squirt water all the way\\
7 - over to the other side of the room.\\
8 - Cool.\\
9 - I'm not allowed to use the sink anymore.\\
10 - Got it.\\
11 - So, what's the deal with your teacher?\\
12 - Miss Tuttle?\\
13 - She's very strict.\\
14 - That could work.\\
15 - Did you see this drawing our son made?\\
16 - It's a cry for his parents to get back together.\\
17 - Alan, it's Davy Crockett at the Alamo.\\
18 - I know.\\
19 - Breaks your heart, doesn't it?\\
20 - I see you got your brother here.\\
21 - He wasn't thrilled about it, but he can't say no to Jake.\\
22 - And I kind of implied\\
23 - that Miss Tuttle was a bit of a freak.\\
24 - Excuse me?\\
25 - Hey, you wanted me to get him here.\\
26 - He's here. The rest is up to you.\\
27 - So, come on. You gonna introduce me?\\
28 - What for?\\
29 - Well, she's your teacher,\\
30 - you're my nephew-- I feel like I...\\
31 - Oh, come on, just do it.\\
32 - Don't you want to see my model of a California mission?\\
33 - It's made of sugar cubes.\\
34 - Okay, first your mission, then mine.\\
35 - JUDITH: May I have everyone's attention?\\
36 - Hello.\\
37 - I'm Judith Harper, the class mom.\\
38 - I just want to thank you all for coming.\\
39 - This is a great turnout.\\
40 - Give yourselves a hand.\\
41 - I understand you teachers are sadly underpaid.\\
42 - That's very true.\\
43 - Well, I'd like to do my part.\\
44 - Can I buy you dinner?\\
45 - So please feel free to put your name on the sign-up sheets\\
46 - if you're available for carpools, coaching, field trips.\\
47 - Charlie Harper.\\
48 - Jake's uncle, mentor, pal.\\
49 - Shh.\\
50 - JUDITH: ...help however we can.\\
51 - And finally, and this is a biggie, folks,\\
52 - it looks as if we're going to have to cancel\\
53 - our annual music show for our fourth graders.\\
54 - ( parents groan )\\
55 - Unless someone with music experience\\
56 - volunteers to help us out.\\
57 - Anyone?\\
58 - Anyone at all?\\
59 - Charlie?\\
60 - Yeah?\\
61 - Thank you.\\
62 - Charlie Harper, everyone.\\
63 - What?\\
64 - * Men... *\\
65 - Go ahead, say it.\\
66 - You traitorous rat bastard.\\
67 - Good, good. Feel better?\\
68 - You set me up.\\
69 - You lured me into that classroom\\
70 - with promises of doughnuts and loose women.\\
71 - I'm sorry.\\
72 - I honestly thought there'd be doughnuts.\\
73 - And what about Miss Tuttle, "the freak"?\\
74 - She's a married, Christian missionary!\\
75 - Okay, that I just lied about.\\
76 - But it was for a good cause.\\
77 - The kids really need you.\\
78 - Yeah, but see, here's the problem.\\
79 - I don't like kids.\\
80 - You like Jake.\\
81 - Jake's different.\\
82 - He's cool, he's our kid.\\
83 - The rest of them... Yech.\\
84 - What other kids do you know?\\
85 - I see them.\\
86 - Having tantrums in supermarkets,\\
87 - screaming in movie theaters, making everything sticky.\\
88 - And the whole world gives them a free ride\\
89 - just because they're cute.\\
90 - Look, forget about the kids.\\
91 - Do this for me and Judith.\\
92 - Not really a big Judith fan, either.\\
93 - Come on. You'll write the music and lyrics.\\
94 - Judith and I will produce and direct-- together.\\
95 - Hold on, hold on.\\
96 - So you roped me into this\\
97 - because you think that the three of us\\
98 - collaborating on a fourth grade tribute\\
99 - to the Industrial Revolution\\
100 - will somehow lead to you getting back together\\
101 - with your allegedly gay ex-wife?\\
102 - It's easy to make anything sound stupid, Charlie.\\
103 - Look, we're still legally married,\\
104 - and frankly I don't buy the whole gay thing.\\
105 - A gay woman would not fake orgasms for 12 years\\
106 - just to protect my feelings.\\
107 - Okay. Take off your seat belt.\\
108 - Why?\\
109 - Because when I slam on the brakes,\\
110 - I want to watch you go through the windshield.\\
111 - Don't be silly.\\
112 - Do you know how fast you'd have to be going...?\\
113 - Hey, slow down.\\
114 - * Manpower, horsepower, coal and steam *\\
115 - * Moving forward the American dream *\\
116 - * Electric, atomic\\
117 - * Solar, too\\
118 - * All this energy for me and you. *\\
119 - Oh, gosh, I want to like it.\\
120 - Yeah, I want to like it.\\
121 - Um...\\
122 - But?\\
123 - But I just don't think it's your best work.\\
124 - It's not. Fire me, please.\\
125 - Remember that show that you and I did in college?\\
126 - "Dormy Weather"? Sure.\\
127 - Those songs had a point of view.\\
128 - Yeah, yeah, and you couldn't get them out of your head.\\
129 - * Coed bathrooms...\\
130 - BOTH: * Coed bathrooms\\
131 - * Wear your flip flops in the coed bathrooms *\\
132 - * Stuff grows on the floor there *\\
133 - * And whoops, there's another pubic hair there. *\\
134 - ALAN: See, you know, maybe the easiest way\\
135 - to do this is for us to write the actual songs.\\
136 - Yeah, and Charlie could just toss\\
137 - in the specific notes and stuff.\\
138 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Charlie, what do you think?\\
139 - Okay, then, uh, then, I guess it's just\\
140 - the two of us.\\
141 - Like the old days. Yeah.\\
142 - Except this time, I'm not a virgin.\\
143 - How come you're not helping\\
144 - Mom and Dad with the show?\\
145 - Well, how can I put this?\\
146 - Your Uncle Charlie is a professional musician,\\
147 - and your mom and dad...\\
148 - Suck?\\
149 - Good a word as any.\\
150 - Well, I think they're going to get back together.\\
151 - You do, huh?\\
152 - Yep. Except if my dad moves back to Mom's house,\\
153 - I probably wouldn't see you anymore.\\
154 - Of course, you'd see me.\\
155 - You'd still have your room here, and I'd come visit.\\
156 - You never visited before.\\
157 - That's 'cause I didn't know you before.\\
158 - That's 'cause you never visited.\\
159 - Gin.\\
160 - To tell you the truth, Jake,\\
161 - I don't think this is going to be an issue.\\
162 - You don't think they're going to get back together?\\
163 - I didn't say that.\\
164 - Well, do you?\\
165 - Hey, what do I know?\\
166 - Well, I think they are.\\
167 - ALAN AND JUDITH: * Robert Fulton\\
168 - * Eli Whitney, Robert Fulton\\
169 - * Eli Whitney\\
170 - * All aboard for Henry Ford.\\
171 - * Henry Ford...\\
172 - Careful what you wish for, pal.\\
173 - Charlie?\\
174 - We're going to be late for rehearsal.\\
175 - ( blender whirring )\\
176 - What are you doing?\\
177 - Making margaritas.\\
178 - But we've got a rehearsal at Jake's school.\\
179 - Don't worry, I have a plan.\\
180 - Oh, Charlie, you're taking liquor to Jake's school?\\
181 - You betcha.\\
182 - I'm not going to face all those pre-pubers\\
183 - without a snoot-ful.\\
184 - They'll have limes in the teachers' lounge, right?\\
185 - No, there's no limes,\\
186 - there's no swizzle sticks, there's...\\
187 - Oh, God.\\
188 - What?\\
189 - It's from Judith's lawyers.\\
190 - Really? Good news?\\
191 - No, it's not good news.\\
192 - Judith filed for divorce.\\
193 - Whoa, man.\\
194 - I'm sorry.\\
195 - What am I going to do?\\
196 - Well, there's a lot of ways to respond\\
197 - to something like this--\\
198 - anger, grief, denial.\\
199 - What would you do?\\
200 - I'd probably blow off rehearsal\\
201 - and start chugging from the blender.\\
202 - I wouldn't recommend that for an amateur.\\
203 - I can't believe she blind-sided me like this.\\
204 - Being so nice and friendly to my face,\\
205 - meanwhile, her lawyers were working\\
206 - behind my face.\\
207 - Let me tell you something, Charlie.\\
208 - A woman who would do such a thing cannot be trusted.\\
209 - Yeah, well, maybe you can use this divorce\\
210 - as a chance to take a little break from each other.\\
211 - Oh, no, that would be playing right into her hands.\\
212 - Alan, your kid's confused enough about you and his mother.\\
213 - Don't make it worse.\\
214 - How could I possibly make it any worse?\\
215 - Let's find out.\\
216 - Okay, everybody, what we're going to do\\
217 - is put the girls on one side, and the boys on the other.\\
218 - Sure, start splitting them up early.\\
219 - That's your answer for everything, isn't it?\\
220 - Excuse me?\\
221 - Uh, would Mrs. Plaintiff\\
222 - please see Mr. Respondent in the hallway?\\
223 - Watch the kids.\\
224 - We'll be right back.\\
225 - Wait!\\
226 - Jake?\\
227 - Where's Jake?\\
228 - Okay, uh, everybody take five.\\
229 - That means sit down.\\
230 - Huh.\\
231 - Stand up.\\
232 - Hop up and down.\\
233 - Right on.\\
234 - But why file for divorce?\\
235 - We were getting along so well.\\
236 - We've been getting along because I don't feel trapped,\\
237 - suffocated and depressed anymore.\\
238 - Oh, sure.\\
239 - Kick me out and then work on improving yourself.\\
240 - Okay,\\
241 - everybody flap your arms like a chicken.\\
242 - ( all clucking )\\
243 - Alan, check it out.\\
244 - I got this amazing power.\\
245 - Stop.\\
246 - Huh?\\
247 - It's like having my own robot army.\\
248 - No, wait, where are you going?\\
249 - ( door slams )\\
250 - Are we going to do our songs?\\
251 - Hey, I'm just the piano player.\\
252 - Lerner and Lowe are out in the hallway working things out.\\
253 - Who?\\
254 - Lerner and Lowe?\\
255 - "My Fair Lady"?\\
256 - "Camelot"?\\
257 - ( quietly ): Aren't there any gay kids here?\\
258 - They're fighting again, aren't they?\\
259 - Yeah, what can I tell you, Jake?\\
260 - Your mom lawyered up, and your dad's freaking out.\\
261 - Stay cool. I'll try to get 'em back in here.\\
262 - Hey, everybody, Jake's in charge so... whatever he says.\\
263 - Okay.\\
264 - It's been fun, but I'm officially resigning\\
265 - as the mayor of Booger Town.\\
266 - Not now, Charlie.\\
267 - You know, I have tried. ( kids screaming )\\
268 - I have tried everything I can to make you happy.\\
269 - Uh, I don't want to rush you or anything,\\
270 - but have you ever read Lord of the Flies?\\
271 - But you know what?\\
272 - You know what? I'm through.\\
273 - Maybe your lawyers can make you happy!\\
274 - Your brother is a horse's ass.\\
275 - Hey, let's not lose sight\\
276 - of who the real victim of this divorce is--\\
277 - me!\\
278 - ( yelling and laughing )\\
279 - Okay, uh, I think we should all calm down just a little.\\
280 - You're not our teacher.\\
281 - Why should we listen to you?\\
282 - ( kids screaming )\\
283 - Okay, let me put it another way.\\
284 - ( yelling ): Shut up and sit down!\\
285 - Thanks.\\
286 - Uh, listen, rehearsal's over.\\
287 - You can all go home.\\
288 - What about our play?\\
289 - Well, you know how they say the show must go on?\\
290 - Well, they weren't talking about this show.\\
291 - Your uncle's so lame.\\
292 - Is not. He's cool.\\
293 - Yeah, right.\\
294 - He is! He's almost famous.\\
295 - He wrote the Maple Loops song.\\
296 - Did not.\\
297 - JAKE: Did, too. Did, too.\\
298 - Prove it.\\
299 - You see that Jaguar in the parking lot?\\
300 - Maple Loops.\\
301 - That doesn't prove anything.\\
302 - Fine.\\
303 - ( plays opening chord )\\
304 - * It's got...\\
305 - KIDS: * Oats and corn and wheat\\
306 - * It's the sweetest breakfast treat *\\
307 - * It's maple-maple- maple-licious. *\\
308 - ( final chord )\\
309 - Whoa.\\
310 - Everybody knows that?\\
311 - Of course.\\
312 - It's the Maple Loops song.\\
313 - Uncle Charlie, do Fudge Nuggets.\\
314 - KIDS: Yeah!\\
315 - ( playing lively intro )\\
316 - * From...\\
317 - * From the magic chocolate mountain *\\
318 - * In a secret chocolate mine\\
319 - * Come Grannie's big fudge nuggets *\\
320 - * With a taste that's oh, so fine. *\\
321 - ( applause and cheering )\\
322 - Yay!\\
323 - What do you know-- maybe I don't hate kids.\\
324 - KIDS: * Smell like a man\\
325 - * Stick, pump or can...\\
326 - CHARLIE: Hold it.\\
327 - CHARLIE: * Can...\\
328 - KIDS: * Can... Hi. Hi.\\
329 - I'm sorry I didn't give you\\
330 - a heads up about the divorce papers.\\
331 - I'm sorry if I overreacted.\\
332 - CHARLIE: Just the girls.\\
333 - GIRLS: * Smell like a man...\\
334 - What's going on in there?\\
335 - I don't know.\\
336 - CHARLIE: * Man...\\
337 - ALL: * Smell like a man\\
338 - * Stick, pump or can\\
339 - * With Dry Guy Deodorant\\
340 - * Only the girls get sweaty.\\
341 - We're getting there. We're getting there!\\
342 - Okay, uh, thank you, Charlie.\\
343 - Yeah, we'll take it from here, okay?\\
344 - Too late. You're out.\\
345 - What about the songs we wrote?\\
346 - Hey, kids, what do you think\\
347 - about the songs they wrote?\\
348 - Boo! Sucks! Stinks!\\
349 - ( shouting continues )\\
350 - These are my people.\\
351 - Wh-What do your jingles have to do\\
352 - with the Industrial Revolution?\\
353 - Look, you wanted a show, I'm giving you a show.\\
354 - Now step back and let us work.\\
355 - "Plumber in a Jar."\\
356 - And let's really sell it this time.\\
357 - ( playing soft intro )\\
358 - ALL: * When your\\
359 - ( tempo picks up ): * Sink backs up\\
360 - * There's just one star\\
361 - * It's the one you trust, it's Plumber In a Jar *\\
362 - * Plumber In a Jar, Plumber In a Jar *\\
363 - * Plumber In a Jar\\
364 - * Plumber In a Jar\\
365 - ( softly ): * Plumber In a Jar\\
366 - * Plumber In a Jar.\\
367 - Hey. Whatcha doing?\\
368 - Trying to find some\\
369 - plausible connection between my jingles\\
370 - and the Industrial Revolution.\\
371 - ( sighs )\\
372 - What's up?\\
373 - I just talked to my dad.\\
374 - He said that he and Mom aren't getting back together again.\\
375 - Yeah.\\
376 - How are you doing with that?\\
377 - I'm not sure.\\
378 - I like that I get to stay here on weekends.\\
379 - That's cool. I like that, too.\\
380 - But you got to be sad about your folks, though, right?\\
381 - No, I'm okay.\\
382 - Jake, it's okay to feel sad... I've been told.\\
383 - And this is a sad thing.\\
384 - My dad's not sad.\\
385 - Of course he is. He's just trying to protect you.\\
386 - From what?\\
387 - From being sad.\\
388 - Yeah, I know, it's a vicious circle,\\
389 - but the liquor industry is built on it.\\
390 - What?\\
391 - Hey, it's not important.\\
392 - All you need to know is that we all feel sad sometimes,\\
393 - and it's okay.\\
394 - Understand?\\
395 - Yeah.\\
396 - Hey, buddy.\\
397 - It's okay, Dad.\\
398 - Before the Industrial Revolution,\\
399 - we lived in an agrarian society.\\
400 - Most people grew their own food\\
401 - and ate what they grew.\\
402 - Breakfast involved...\\
403 - Slaughtering animals.\\
404 - And milking cows.\\
405 - It would be hundreds of years\\
406 - before people could enjoy a pre-packaged\\
407 - and nutritious breakfast.\\
408 - And what's in that breakfast?\\
409 - ( playing opening chord )\\
410 - * It's got...\\
411 - * Oats and corn and wheat\\
412 - * It's the sweetest breakfast treat *\\
413 - * It's maple-maple- maple-licious. *\\
414 - ( final chord )\\
415 - As urbanization led to stress and loneliness,\\
416 - industrial society looked to an ancient agrarian product\\
417 - for a delicious and refreshing solution.\\
418 - * The girls look prettier with Hammerstein Beer *\\
419 - * You like what you see, and you like what you hear *\\
420 - * Have a cold frosty mug and pull her near *\\
421 - * The girls look prettier, the girls look prettier *\\
422 - * The girls look prettier with Hammerstein Beer. *\\
423 - We're not letting him anywhere near\\
424 - the Christmas pageant.\\
425 - Agreed.\\
426 - Even with the advent of indoor plumbing,\\
427 - the Industrial Revolution still had some bugs in the system.\\
428 - What was man to do?\\
429 - Three, four...\\
430 - * If your home is bug infested\\
431 - * Filled with spiders, flies and gnats *\\
432 - * All our sprays are safely tested *\\
433 - * We kill vermin, not your cats. *
\subsection {Episode 09: Phase One, Complete}
1 - ( man and woman giggling )\\

26 - I like that you didn't lie to him.\\
27 - Well, I-I try to be honest.\\
28 - * Men... *\\
29 - Do you want a cup of coffee before you go?\\
30 - No, you've got work to do.\\
31 - I should probably get going.\\
32 - Charlie, there's, uh, there's French toast left.\\
33 - Oh, no thanks. You met Wendy, right?\\
34 - Uh, sure, um, French toast, Wendy?\\
35 - Oh, no, thank you, I-I should really get going.\\

47 - Copacetic.\\
48 - That means okay.\\
49 - When he moved in here, he was saying "swell".\\
50 - Oh, yeah,\\
51 - I got to go to my office for a couple of hours.\\
52 - Uh, are you okay to watch Jake?\\
53 - No problem.\\
54 - Swell.\\
55 - Will you take me RollerBlading, Uncle Charlie?\\
56 - I can't, buddy, I got work to do.\\
57 - What am I going to do all day?\\
58 - Well, it's really nice outside.\\
59 - Why don't you wash my car?\\
60 - No, I want to go RollerBlading.\\
61 - You know, I could take him.\\
62 - I've got my blades right in the car.\\
63 - Really?\\
64 - If it's okay with your father.\\
65 - That sounds swell.\\
66 - JAKE: I'll go get my blades.\\
67 - Well, if you want, I can go pick up lunch\\
68 - and bring it back, and we can have a picnic.\\
69 - Yeah.\\
70 - Swell.\\
71 - Nice girl.\\
72 - Is it serious?\\
73 - It is now, you dumbass.\\
74 - Hey.\\
75 - Finish your jingle?\\
76 - How can I work?\\
77 - First, Wendy took Jake RollerBlading,\\
78 - then she took him to the movies.\\
79 - Now she's in the kitchen making us all... dinner.\\
80 - That bitch.\\
81 - Don't you get it?\\
82 - She's using your kid\\
83 - to turn a nice, casual relationship\\
84 - into a "relationship."\\
85 - Okay, okay, now I get where you're coming from.\\
86 - Thank you.\\
87 - You're paranoid and you're nuts.\\
88 - Perfect timing. Dinner's ready.\\
89 - ( whispering ): Did you see that?\\
90 - She's wearing an apron...\\
91 - ...in my house.\\
92 - Do you know what that means?\\
93 - I'm going to stick with paranoid and nuts, Bob.\\
94 - Are you sure you don't want me to stay and do the dishes?\\
95 - Positive.\\
96 - Alan will just rewash them anyway.\\
97 - Uh... well, I guess, uh...\\
98 - I should probably get going.\\
99 - Yeah, I guess.\\
100 - Oh, good, you're still here.\\
101 - Uh, Jake wants to say good night.\\
102 - Oh, wow, he's such a sweetie.\\
103 - Don't you just want to eat him up?\\
104 - If that would stop him, yes.\\
105 - I-I-I got to tell you, Charlie,\\
106 - I think that girl's a keeper.\\
107 - You think so, huh?\\
108 - Yeah. She's smart, she's pretty,\\
109 - and I-I think she really likes you.\\
110 - Be honest, Alan.\\
111 - You married the first girl who slipped you the tongue, didn't you?\\
112 - No.\\
113 - Trust me.\\
114 - This woman has a plan,\\
115 - and it's diabolical in its Machiavellian scope.\\
116 - I did not marry the first girl who slipped me the tongue.\\
117 - I'm telling you, she's got her foot in the door,\\
118 - and she will never leave.\\
119 - Okay, well, I'm out of here.\\
120 - Ooh, diabolical.\\
121 - Okay, so I'll, uh, give you a call.\\
122 - Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.\\
123 - Okay. Okay.\\
124 - It's pretty dark out.\\
125 - Maybe you should... go in the morning.\\
126 - Yeah, I suppose I could.\\
127 - Are you seeing this?\\
128 - Howdy, neighbor.\\
129 - Charlie's busy right now, Rose.\\
130 - I know. White Toyota hasn't budged an inch\\
131 - two nights in a row.\\
132 - I chalked her tires.\\
133 - You do know there's a-a stairway right over there.\\
134 - Of course.\\
135 - Did you know\\
136 - there's a crawl space under the house\\
137 - that comes right up into your bedroom?\\
138 - So, what are you doing?\\
139 - I'm playing computer Scrabble.\\
140 - All by yourself?\\
141 - That's so sad.\\
142 - Well, I, uh, I used to play\\
143 - with my wife every night, and I guess I miss it.\\
144 - You and I have a lot in common don't we?\\
145 - How so?\\
146 - We're both like two lonely socks\\
147 - that want desperately to keep someone's feet warm,\\
148 - but we don't match up with any other socks,\\
149 - so all we can hope for is to be a dust mitten...\\
150 - or a hand puppet.\\
151 - That's, uh... that's very... insightful...\\
152 - and disturbing.\\
153 - Um...\\
154 - you're not thinking...\\
155 - you and me, are you?\\
156 - Oh, Alan, that's very flattering, but...\\
157 - eww.\\
158 - Wendy?\\
159 - "Dear Charlie,\\
160 - "thanks for a wonderful night.\\
161 - Sweet. Special. See you soon."\\
162 - * Free... dom\\
163 - * I'm free\\
164 - * Lots of free\\
165 - * I'm free\\
166 - * Lots of free\\
167 - All right, you had sex last night.\\
168 - You don't have to turn into Mr. Bojangles.\\
169 - Oh, it's better than that.\\
170 - I had sex, and I woke up alone.\\
171 - If there were pancakes on my night table,\\
172 - it'd be the perfect morning.\\
173 - What happened to Wendy's diabolical Machiavellian scheme to never leave?\\
174 - I don't know.\\
175 - I must have foiled it somehow.\\
176 - Guess what? Grandma's here.\\
177 - Let's see that little dance again.\\
178 - When I was pregnant with Charlie,\\
179 - we thought he was going to be a girl.\\
180 - The sonogram showed no discernible penis whatsoever.\\
181 - Now do you believe me?\\
182 - First she sucks in Jake, then you, now Mom.\\
183 - She's like one of those pods from outer space...\\
184 - but, you know, with a cute ass.\\
185 - Charlie, she wouldn't even be here now\\
186 - if you hadn't taken her upstairs last night.\\
187 - That was not my fault.\\
188 - You saw how she kissed me.\\
189 - I had to take her upstairs.\\
190 - EVELYN: Remember what I said:\\
191 - hook him on the milk; he'll buy the cow.\\
192 - Charlie,\\
193 - where have you been hiding this girl?\\
194 - She's an absolute delight.\\
195 - Yeah, she's swell.\\
196 - Good morning. I-I read somewhere you'd left.\\
197 - Yeah, I was on my way out the door,\\
198 - and then I ran into your mom,\\
199 - and then we started talking, and you know.\\
200 - Yeah. I know.\\
201 - So, uh, what brings you here, Mom?\\
202 - Do I need a reason?\\
203 - I'd like one.\\
204 - I'm showing a house in Malibu.\\
205 - I thought I'd swing by and take my grandson out for pancakes.\\
206 - Uh, Charlie wants his on his night table.\\
207 - I'm ready. You coming, Dad?\\
208 - Are you kidding? I-I-I want to hear more about that sonogram.\\
209 - Good. Are you and Wendy joining us, Charlie?\\
210 - Uh, gee, Mom, I think Wendy has stuff to do, right, Wendy?\\
211 - Uh... I can always make time for pancakes.\\
212 - Oh, wonderful, a family breakfast.\\
213 - Go put on some pants, Charlie.\\
214 - But Mom... Now.\\
215 - You have to be firm with him.\\
216 - By the way... your nose is adorable.\\
217 - Thank you. I'm guessing Dr. Shapiro?\\
218 - No, it's mine.\\
219 - Oh.\\
220 - Huh.\\
221 - Well, sometimes God does good work, too.\\
222 - Jake, get your stuff together.\\
223 - We got to get you back to your Mom's.\\
224 - Already? But we're playing.\\
225 - Yeah, I got to get going, too, Jake.\\
226 - Aw!\\
227 - Okay,\\
228 - I pulled your car around.\\
229 - If you leave now, I think you'll miss all the weekend traffic.\\
230 - Don't you worry, Charlie. I'm leaving.\\
231 - Oh, I'm not worried; I just moved your car so Alan can get out.\\
232 - I can get out.\\
233 - Yes, Alan, now you can.\\
234 - Thank you for a great weekend.\\
235 - No, thank you.\\
236 - Jake.\\
237 - Bye. Bye.\\
238 - Alan, I'll see you soon.\\
239 - Bye. Bye.\\
240 - I got to tell you, Charlie, I-I-I think she's really...\\
241 - Shh!\\
242 - ( car pulls away )\\
243 - Okay.\\
244 - What?\\
245 - I'm just saying I-I-I think she's really great.\\
246 - Me, too. When's she coming back?\\
247 - Well, let's see, today's Sunday, so...\\
248 - never.\\
249 - Why not?\\
250 - Well, buddy, uh, she wants something different\\
251 - in a relationship than your Uncle Charlie does.\\
252 - What does she want?\\
253 - Uncle Charlie.\\
254 - What do you want?\\
255 - Uncle Charlie.\\
256 - And we both can't have me.\\
257 - I don't understand.\\
258 - It's very simple, buddy.\\
259 - Uncle Charlie... is nuts.\\
260 - Yeah, nuts like a fox.\\
261 - So then Wendy can't take me RollerBlading anymore?\\
262 - Nope.\\
263 - No more movies?\\
264 - Afraid not.\\
265 - Boy, you suck.\\
266 - Suck?\\
267 - How do I suck?\\
268 - Like a fox.\\
269 - * Men... *\\
270 - There he is.\\
271 - Let the party begin.\\
272 - Shakin' Jake.\\
273 - Notorious J-A-K-E.\\
274 - Jake, he won't stop until you say "Hello."\\
275 - Jakedy Jake Jake.\\
276 - Hello.\\
277 - So how was school this week?\\
278 - We missed you around here.\\
279 - It was just school.\\
280 - Yeah. I heard that, just school.\\
281 - Right on.\\
282 - I don't believe it,\\
283 - he's still mad about the Wendy thing.\\
284 - Charlie, it's only been a week,\\
285 - I'm still mad that you peed in my Boy Scout canteen in 1978.\\
286 - Not much of a jamboree for you was it?\\
287 - Okay, I'm sorry about the canteen.\\
288 - Now will you please make your son like me again?\\
289 - How would I do that, Charlie?\\
290 - And by the way, was that so hard?\\
291 - Explain to him that Wendy was working an angle,\\
292 - making friends with him to get to me.\\
293 - Do you really want me to tell a ten-year-old boy\\
294 - that somebody he really cares about\\
295 - was pretending to like him?\\
296 - What kind of lesson is that?\\
297 - He lives in L.A., he might as well learn now.\\
298 - Just give him some time, he'll get over it.\\
299 - ( knock on door )\\
300 - Hey. Can I come in?\\
301 - It's your house.\\
302 - Well, it's your house, too.\\
303 - Then no.\\
304 - You know what, it is my house.\\
305 - Look, Jake, I'm sorry about the Wendy thing,\\
306 - but there's nothing I can do about it.\\
307 - I want us to be buddies again,\\
308 - I don't want you to hate me anymore.\\
309 - I don't hate you.\\
310 - Good.\\
311 - I'm just very disappointed in you.\\
312 - Hey...\\
313 - I get enough of that crap from my mother.\\
314 - So what's it going to take?\\
315 - Cash, video games?\\
316 - I don't want stuff,\\
317 - I got plenty of stuff when my mom and dad broke up.\\
318 - Oh, dude, this isn't the same thing.\\
319 - What's the difference?\\
320 - You liked Wendy, then you didn't like her,\\
321 - and no one cares what I want.\\
322 - Jake, buddy, come here.\\
323 - Come here.\\
324 - Sit down.\\
325 - It's not that I don't care what you want,\\
326 - it's just that you're a kid.\\
327 - What you want doesn't matter.\\
328 - Wow.\\
329 - I do suck.\\
330 - H... A...\\
331 - T.\\
332 - "Hat."\\
333 - That's it?\\
334 - All this time for "Hat?"\\
335 - Let me see your tiles.\\
336 - Oh, see...\\
337 - you had "Hateful."\\
338 - See, it would fit right here off the A in "Mychotidian."\\
339 - How did you see that?\\
340 - I have Scrabble eyes, it's a gift.\\
341 - And sometimes a curse.\\
342 - Alan?\\
343 - Jake won't play with me.\\
344 - Well, I can't play with you either Charlie, I am "Occupied."\\
345 - You play "Pie" at your own peril, my friend.\\
346 - Hi, Charlie.\\
347 - Hi, Rose. Alan?\\
348 - Come here.\\
349 - Your move.\\
350 - What?\\
351 - What are you doing with Rose?\\
352 - I'm teaching her to play Scrabble.\\
353 - Oh, Alan, you are so naive.\\
354 - "Naive," eight points.\\
355 - What?\\
356 - Uh, sorry, I'm in my game head.\\
357 - Alan, Rose is using you to get to me.\\
358 - Do you hear the rampant egotism?\\
359 - "Rampant," eleven points, "Egotism," ten,\\
360 - coming out of your mouth?\\
361 - I'm just saying...\\
362 - Not everybody is trying to get to you Charlie.\\
363 - The only thing that's going on here\\
364 - is two lonely people playing a game of Scrabble.\\
365 - Oh. Alan.\\
366 - Please tell me you're not thinking about you and Rose.\\
367 - Uh, me and Rose?\\
368 - Eww.\\
369 - Let's see.\\
370 - One Russian blonde.\\
371 - One Scottish brunette.\\
372 - And a full-bodied redhead from Napa Valley.\\
373 - Charlie's Angels.\\
374 - Oh. Whoa.\\
375 - Sorry.\\
376 - Oh, hi.\\
377 - Hi.\\
378 - What are you doing here?\\
379 - I'm grocery shopping.\\
380 - Here? In my super market?\\
381 - So this is just a coincidence?\\
382 - Well, it's not entirely,\\
383 - I eat food, and I live two blocks away.\\
384 - Oh, come on Wendy, we both know that...\\
385 - Everything okay?\\
386 - Oh, yeah, yeah, everything's fine.\\
387 - Uh, Dave, this is Charlie,\\
388 - Charlie, Dave.\\
389 - Hey.\\
390 - Hey.\\
391 - Dave, we need a Duraflame log.\\
392 - Okay.\\
393 - Who's that? Your brother?\\
394 - No, he's...\\
395 - Look, Charlie, uh...\\
396 - I know I probably should have given you a call,\\
397 - but I just thought that after last weekend it was pretty clear\\
398 - it wasn't going to work out between you and me.\\
399 - What?\\
400 - Well, I mean, I was happy\\
401 - to entertain your nephew for a while.\\
402 - I mean he's a great kid, but who's got the energy?\\
403 - And your mother, she's been calling me all week.\\
404 - She wants to go to a spinning class with me--\\
405 - what is up with that?\\
406 - I thought you two hit it off.\\
407 - I'm from the Midwest, I was being polite.\\
408 - What did you think was a going on?\\
409 - That.\\
410 - Listen, no offense.\\
411 - No, of course not.\\
412 - So, so you and Dave, how serious is that?\\
413 - Good-bye, Charlie.\\
414 - You know, you're breaking a little boy's heart.\\
415 - See, my relationships with women, they come and go.\\
416 - But you and me, we're family\\
417 - and that's solid, that's forever.\\
418 - Are you with me?\\
419 - I think so.\\
420 - I mean, maybe I shouldn't be laying this on you\\
421 - 'cause you're ten,\\
422 - but I'm beginning to realize I might not be the guy\\
423 - I thought everybody thought I was.\\
424 - Hmm.\\
425 - Yeah.\\
426 - It's a mind blower isn't it?\\
427 - You see, the problem isn't with who I go out with,\\
428 - the problem is with me.\\
429 - Your Uncle Charlie has some major trust issues with women.\\
430 - It might have something to do\\
431 - with my relationship with my mom.\\
432 - I understand.\\
433 - Do you?\\
434 - No, I'm just tired; I don't care anymore.\\
435 - So we're cool?\\
436 - Yeah.\\
437 - Good.\\
438 - Good night.\\
439 - Uncle Charlie?\\
440 - Yeah?\\
441 - Does this mean you don't\\
442 - have nuts like a fox?\\
443 - Yeah.\\
444 - That's what it means.\\
445 - ( microwave dings )\\
446 - Don't look at my tiles, Alan.\\
447 - Scrabbleized, my sweet petootie.\\
448 - He's a tile peeker.\\
449 - Rose, listen, uh...\\
450 - I think I owe you an apology.\\
451 - You mean for seducing me with your roguish charms\\
452 - and then dumping me like a bag of old doorknobs?\\
453 - That, and, more recently, uh...\\
454 - I told Alan that you were being nice to him\\
455 - just to get close to me.\\
456 - And I've come\\
457 - to realize that's my own paranoia about women\\
458 - trying to manipulate me,\\
459 - and I'm sorry that I projected that on you.\\
460 - Oh, come here you big silly.\\
461 - I forgive you.\\
462 - Really? Mm-hmm.\\
463 - Thank you.\\
464 - ( loud knocking )\\
465 - I got to go.\\
466 - Your brother is out of control with that egg timer.\\
467 - You think maybe I could play with you guys?\\
468 - It's fine with me, go ask Mr. That's-Not-A-Word.\\
469 - Thanks.\\
470 - And again, I'm sorry.\\
471 - I'll be right there.\\
472 - Phase One, complete.
\subsection {Episode 10: Merry Thanksgiving}
1 - Hey. What are you doing?\\
2 - Picking out a shirt.\\
3 - Oh. That one looks nice.\\
4 - You like it? Yeah.\\
5 - Then no.\\
6 - Okay. Uh, listen, I was wondering, um...\\
7 - do you have any plans for Thanksgiving?\\
8 - Alan, I don't think that far ahead.\\
9 - It's this Thursday.\\
10 - No kidding.\\
11 - Didn't we just get through\\
12 - that whole pumpkin... the costume thing with the kid?\\
13 - Halloween?\\
14 - Yeah.\\
15 - Yeah, three weeks ago.\\
16 - Huh. Then no, I-I got no plans. Why?\\
17 - Well, I was thinking, uh,\\
18 - Jake's going to be with his mom and her parents,\\
19 - and I thought maybe you and I could do something.\\
20 - Okay. Want to go to Vegas?\\
21 - Well, I was thinking something a little more traditional.\\
22 - Reno?\\
23 - Charlie, it's a family holiday.\\
24 - Yeah, so, I'm your family...\\
25 - unless you want to spend a perfectly good Thursday\\
26 - with Mom the Impaler.\\
27 - Think we can get into the Bellagio?\\
28 - Leave it to me.\\
29 - Ooh, that one's nice.\\
30 - Here's what we'll do.\\
31 - We'll fly to Vegas, have a big steak dinner,\\
32 - get you a lap dance and a bucket of nickels.\\
33 - What are the nickels for?\\
34 - I'll explain it on the plane.\\
35 - You know, that-that sounds kind of fun.\\
36 - Two single guys rockin' out in Vegas.\\
37 - The-the glitz, the glamour...\\
38 - Dude...\\
39 - don't gay it up.\\
40 - You know, I like this shirt much better.\\
41 - Stop screwing with me, Alan.\\
42 - So, uh, who's the lucky gal?\\
43 - Remember Lisa?\\
44 - Lisa who used to live here Lisa?\\
45 - She lived here; she moved out.\\
46 - She lived here; I moved out.\\
47 - At one point, neither one of us lived here.\\
48 - Yeah,\\
49 - that Lisa.\\
50 - Wow. So she's going\\
51 - to take you back again?\\
52 - Hey, who said she's the one who broke up with...\\
53 - Yeah, I'm hoping.\\
54 - Well, good luck.\\
55 - Thanks.\\
56 - ( door shuts )\\
57 - I've completely lost confidence in this shirt.\\
58 - Hey, Lis, sorry I'm late.\\
59 - Hey. How many times did you change your shirt\\
60 - before you left the house?\\
61 - I wanted to look pretty for you.\\
62 - You're such a girl.\\
63 - Thanks, you too.\\
64 - It's good to see you.\\
65 - It's good to see you, too.\\
66 - So... you want to just blow this place\\
67 - and get a room?\\
68 - I can't.\\
69 - Why not?\\
70 - I'm getting married.\\
71 - Yeah. Ha, ha. Me, too.\\
72 - I'm not kidding.\\
73 - You can't do that. You love me.\\
74 - That's not the point.\\
75 - I'm tired of doing\\
76 - this dance of death with you:\\
77 - hooking up, breaking up, making up...\\
78 - That's not a dance of death.\\
79 - That's... the circle of life.\\
80 - It may be your life, but it's not mine.\\
81 - Not anymore.\\
82 - I'm moving on.\\
83 - To what?\\
84 - To settling down.\\
85 - To having a family.\\
86 - To not having my heart constantly broken\\
87 - by a man who refuses to grow up.\\
88 - And that would be me?\\
89 - Yes, you, you big ass!\\
90 - But the sex was awesome, though, right?\\
91 - Yes, it was... but there's more...\\
92 - to relationships... Is it awesome with your fianc  ?\\
93 - None of your business.\\
94 - It's not, is it?\\
95 - God, why did I call you?\\
96 - I'll tell you why.\\
97 - Because in your heart,\\
98 - you know you're about to make a huge mistake,\\
99 - and you want me to talk you out of it.\\
100 - No. I was hoping you and I could have some closure.\\
101 - Well, then I refer you back to my suggestion\\
102 - that we blow this place and get a room.\\
103 - Same old Charlie.\\
104 - What if I wasn't?\\
105 - Would you still be marrying this clown?\\
106 - Bo is not a clown.\\
107 - Bo?\\
108 - Bo.\\
109 - I'm sorry.\\
110 - Bo-Bo is a clown.\\
111 - Charlie, you'll never change.\\
112 - Look at you-- a grown man who can't even commit to long pants.\\
113 - Hey, I could commit to long pants.\\
114 - I was just focused on the shirt today...\\
115 - And for your information, I've gone\\
116 - through changes like you wouldn't believe\\
117 - since the last time we were together.\\
118 - Like what?\\
119 - Well... I have a kid now.\\
120 - Oh, God, Charlie,\\
121 - what poor girl did you knock up?\\
122 - No, no, no. It's my nephew.\\
123 - He and my brother are living with me now.\\
124 - I'm, like, Mr. Family Guy.\\
125 - Yeah, right. Family Guy.\\
126 - How's it going with your mom?\\
127 - What the hell's my mom got to do with family?\\
128 - Come on, Charlie.\\
129 - We both know you'll never have a successful relationship\\
130 - with any woman, let alone me,\\
131 - until you resolve your issues with your mother.\\
132 - Well... as a matter of fact,\\
133 - it just so happens,\\
134 - on that note, since you mentioned it...\\
135 - ...those issues are resolved.\\
136 - Really.\\
137 - How'd that happen?\\
138 - You know, uh... communication,\\
139 - self-reflection, personal growth, crap like that.\\
140 - The important thing is I now have\\
141 - a much deeper appreciation for--\\
142 - what do you call 'em-- traditional values.\\
143 - Traditional values?\\
144 - This from a guy who offered my sister a car\\
145 - if she'd come to bed with us?\\
146 - It was a joke, and I was drunk...\\
147 - ...but still, it shows a yearning for family.\\
148 - Okay, this is going nowhere.\\
149 - Lisa, wait. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.\\
150 - I-I don't want you to not be in my life anymore.\\
151 - I'd-I'd like us to be friends.\\
152 - I'd like that, too.\\
153 - Good. So when are you getting married?\\
154 - Well, we haven't set a date.\\
155 - We're going to talk about it when Bo gets back from New York on Monday.\\
156 - Oh, so, you're all alone for Thanksgiving?\\
157 - Yeah. Why?\\
158 - Change of plans.\\
159 - * Men... *\\
160 - We're going to have a big family dinner right here.\\
161 - Uh-huh, and whose big family\\
162 - were you planning on inviting?\\
163 - You know, you, me, Jake, Mom, turkey,\\
164 - just like the good old days.\\
165 - What good old days?\\
166 - It's just an expression.\\
167 - Don't get hung up on it.\\
168 - Oh, and Lisa might come.\\
169 - Okay, what's going on?\\
170 - I need to show Lisa that I'm a family guy.\\
171 - But you're not.\\
172 - That's not the point.\\
173 - She's about to go off and marry some jerk\\
174 - just because he loves her and wants to settle down.\\
175 - Oh, I get it.\\
176 - You're Satan.\\
177 - Alan, this is serious.\\
178 - I could lose her forever.\\
179 - Wow... and you care?\\
180 - I love her, Alan.\\
181 - She's the only one I ever thought\\
182 - I might eventually wind up with.\\
183 - "Eventually wind up with."\\
184 - I'm touched.\\
185 - So, you want to, what,\\
186 - keep her warming up in your bullpen\\
187 - until the bottom of the ninth, when you lose your... arm?\\
188 - Okay, I don't know how we got onto sports...\\
189 - ...but the thing is I really care for Lisa,\\
190 - and she needs to believe I'm capable of changing.\\
191 - Ah, but the thing is you're not.\\
192 - We don't know that.\\
193 - I might be.\\
194 - Who knows what would happen if I actually tried?\\
195 - You're-you're really serious about this.\\
196 - Alan, I've got a 200-pound turkey melting in my lap.\\
197 - What do you think?\\
198 - Okay, okay. How-how can I help?\\
199 - Well, obviously, we can't have\\
200 - a family Thanksgiving without a kid,\\
201 - so you need to get Jake back from your wife.\\
202 - Simple as that, huh?\\
203 - Okay, so-so I go to Judith, and I say,\\
204 - "Forget the fact that we agreed on a custody schedule.\\
205 - "Forget the fact that your parents are driving\\
206 - "all the way from Sacramento to spend time with their grandson.\\
207 - "Uh, Charlie needs to use our son as a prop\\
208 - "so that he can maintain an on-again off-again relationship\\
209 - with a woman with whom he might eventually wind up."\\
210 - You know what?\\
211 - I'll talk to her. Yeah.\\
212 - No way in hell.\\
213 - Are you insane?\\
214 - What's wrong with you?\\
215 - Okay, maybe I didn't explain it correctly.\\
216 - You explained it fine.\\
217 - You're not taking Jake for Thanksgiving.\\
218 - Not just Jake. You can come, too, and your parents.\\
219 - Think of it: the whole family, just like the good old days.\\
220 - What good old days?\\
221 - Geez, why is everybody so damn literal?\\
222 - Look, Judith, what is Thanksgiving about\\
223 - if not family,\\
224 - and wouldn't it be good for Jake\\
225 - to spend Thanksgiving with his whole family,\\
226 - because that's what Thanksgiving is about:\\
227 - family... and stuff.\\
228 - I don't know.\\
229 - And you wouldn't have to lift a finger.\\
230 - I'll have someone there to do the cooking,\\
231 - the serving, and the cleaning.\\
232 - Really? Who?\\
233 - My housekeeper, Berta.\\
234 - She's a saint, and she's really looking forward to this.\\
235 - No way in hell. Are you insane?\\
236 - What's wrong with you?\\
237 - Come on.\\
238 - I don't work holidays, Charlie.\\
239 - Please?\\
240 - I got a life, you know.\\
241 - Pretty please?\\
242 - My brother is in the Witness Protection Program,\\
243 - and I've been invited to spend Thanksgiving with him\\
244 - at an undisclosed location.\\
245 - I'll give you $1,000.\\
246 - Done.\\
247 - ( doorbell rings )\\
248 - Hi. You must be Jake.\\
249 - Yes, I am. My wonderful Uncle Charlie\\
250 - has opened his home to me and my father\\
251 - 'cause we had nowhere else to go.\\
252 - Hey-hey, merry Thanksgiving!\\
253 - I like what you've done with the place.\\
254 - You picked out everything here.\\
255 - I know.\\
256 - I just wanted to make sure you did.\\
257 - Charlie, I've got to admit,\\
258 - I never thought I'd see the day\\
259 - when you'd be hosting a family Thanksgiving.\\
260 - Well, like I've been telling you,\\
261 - I've changed.\\
262 - So, with that in mind,\\
263 - you want to blow this place and get a room?\\
264 - Charlie, stop it.\\
265 - Come on, introduce me.\\
266 - Fine.\\
267 - Lisa, this is Judith, my former sister-in-law,\\
268 - but still, you know, family.\\
269 - Hi. Nice to meet you.\\
270 - Nice to meet you.\\
271 - And these, of course, are her wonderful parents,\\
272 - Sherman and Lorraine.\\
273 - Sheldon and Lenore.\\
274 - Sheldon and Lenore.\\
275 - CHARLIE: It's great to see you, folks.\\
276 - So, Shelley, how are you liking California?\\
277 - We live in California.\\
278 - So you must really like it.\\
279 - ALAN: Hi, Lisa.\\
280 - So nice to see you again.\\
281 - Hi, Alan. Long time.\\
282 - See, isn't this great?\\
283 - This is why we all come together.\\
284 - We break up, we make up, but in the end,\\
285 - the love is the love, and the family is the family.\\
286 - Ease up on the wine, Charlie.\\
287 - No, he's right, and Alan,\\
288 - Sheldon and I want you to know\\
289 - that even though you and our daughter\\
290 - are no longer married,\\
291 - we will always think of you as our son.\\
292 - What the hell is that supposed to mean, Ma?\\
293 - It means that even though you loused up your marriage,\\
294 - we still love him.\\
295 - Oh, thanks a lot, Dad, I appreciate the blame.\\
296 - This is really Judith's family.\\
297 - Let's go find mine.\\
298 - Hey, Berta, look who's here.\\
299 - Hi, Berta.\\
300 - Oh, honey, don't tell me you're back here again.\\
301 - Don't you ever learn?\\
302 - As a matter of fact, I think I have.\\
303 - Good for you.\\
304 - You can do so much better.\\
305 - And remember, you may have two grandmothers,\\
306 - but only one of them has enough money\\
307 - to send you to medical school.\\
308 - What if I don't want to go to medical school?\\
309 - Well, then, you break your grandmommy's heart,\\
310 - just like your father did.\\
311 - Dad's a doctor.\\
312 - No, sweetheart.\\
313 - Your father's a chiropractor.\\
314 - That's a masseuse without the hot oil.\\
315 - Go play with your friends.\\
316 - I'm the only kid here.\\
317 - Well, you might want to think about why that is.\\
318 - I want more money.\\
319 - Hey, Mom.\\
320 - You remember Lisa, right?\\
321 - We used to live together.\\
322 - Oh, no, I don't. I'm sorry.\\
323 - Hello, dear.\\
324 - My son has had so many little roommates.\\
325 - I just hope you've got better taste\\
326 - than the one who picked out his hideous furniture.\\
327 - Hey, who's got unresolved issues with her now?\\
328 - Did it ever occur to you that you might want to support me,\\
329 - your daughter?\\
330 - Well, why can't we support Alan, too?\\
331 - Because I'm divorcing him.\\
332 - Well, who told you to go and do that?\\
333 - It's very sweet of you to go to all this trouble,\\
334 - but who are you kidding?\\
335 - The plaid shirt, the sweater vest,\\
336 - the kid actor?\\
337 - No, no, no, that's really my nephew.\\
338 - I love you, Charlie,\\
339 - but you're not going to change my mind.\\
340 - Live with me.\\
341 - Charlie...\\
342 - No, I'm serious. Move back in.\\
343 - Really? And then what?\\
344 - And then... we'll see.\\
345 - Wow. A commitment to see.\\
346 - And what finger does that ring go on, Charlie?\\
347 - You know what I mean.\\
348 - I know exactly what you mean.\\
349 - You want me to waste a couple more years of my life\\
350 - on a relationship that's absolutely doomed to fail.\\
351 - Not your life--\\
352 - our life.\\
353 - Uh, look, I-I appreciate your-your feelings for me,\\
354 - but I have to tell you,\\
355 - I really think y-your daughter deserves a lot of respect.\\
356 - I mean, it takes real courage\\
357 - to make changes in your life\\
358 - and not worry about what everybody thinks.\\
359 - Thank you, Alan.\\
360 - That's true.\\
361 - The lesbians of my generation were too scared\\
362 - to come out of the closet.\\
363 - Does that mean what I think it means?\\
364 - You haven't told them?\\
365 - No. I thought it would be more appropriate\\
366 - coming from your mother!\\
367 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
368 - Did I faux pas?\\
369 - ( all arguing )\\
370 - Happy Thanksgiving.\\
371 - Sorry I'm late, but I didn't realize you were having a party.\\
372 - Hi, I'm Rose. Hi.\\
373 - Don't worry, Charlie and I had sex once,\\
374 - but now we're just friends.\\
375 - Who's ready for mystery pie?\\
376 - If you were living here,\\
377 - these kinds of things probably wouldn't happen.\\
378 - Here it is.\\
379 - Ooh, Berta, nice-looking bird.\\
380 - Thanks for blowing off your family\\
381 - and cooking for ours.\\
382 - Shove over.\\
383 - Are we going to go around the table\\
384 - and say what we're thankful for?\\
385 - Ooh, ooh, me.\\
386 - I got one.\\
387 - ( clears throat )\\
388 - I'm thankful for the food we eat\\
389 - and thankful for the friends we meet.\\
390 - I'm thankful for my comfy seat.\\
391 - I'm thankful for...\\
392 - the birdie's feet.\\
393 - * White with foam\\
394 - * God bless America...*\\
395 - Pull up, Rose.\\
396 - Sorry.\\
397 - Jake, why-why don't you go?\\
398 - Okay. I'm thankful for my mom and dad and my Uncle Charlie\\
399 - who has shown in the few short months\\
400 - that I've been here that he is capable of sig...\\
401 - Significant.\\
402 - Significant change and growth.\\
403 - Too obvious?\\
404 - Little bit.\\
405 - Okay, uh, well, I'm thankful that I can spend the holiday\\
406 - with, uh, all the people I love and all the people who love me.\\
407 - And Judith.\\
408 - I'm thankful I'll be dead someday,\\
409 - and you'll all feel horrible you weren't nicer to me.\\
410 - And I'm thankful that our daughter\\
411 - gave us at least one grandchild before she...\\
412 - ( sobbing )\\
413 - I'm thankful I finally found a therapist\\
414 - who has no compunction\\
415 - about prescribing powerful sedatives.\\
416 - Well, I'm thankful\\
417 - I can sit here and listen to you rich people whine\\
418 - while my family's scrambling for a corn dog\\
419 - at the Pomona Fairgrounds.\\
420 - Charlie?\\
421 - No, you first.\\
422 - Um... well, I'm thankful for you.\\
423 - And I hope you'll always be my friend.\\
424 - Okay. Well, I'm thankful for you, too.\\
425 - And I'm thankful for everybody coming together today\\
426 - as unwitting participants in my desperate charade.\\
427 - Amen.\\
428 - Okay, maybe I should carve the turkey.\\
429 - I'll handle that for you, son.\\
430 - No, you both sit down. I'll do it.\\
431 - No, Mom, I can do it.\\
432 - Oh, now, don't be ridiculous. No, Mom.\\
433 - ( all talking simultaneously )\\
434 - Okay, everybody, stop!\\
435 - Mom, give me the knife.\\
436 - Charlie, don't be silly.\\
437 - You don't know how to carve a turkey.\\
438 - Maybe not, but I'm the head of this household,\\
439 - and the head of the household is supposed to carve the turkey.\\
440 - Why, because you saw it on some TV show?\\
441 - I swear, you are just like your father.\\
442 - No, I am not just like my father.\\
443 - My father was afraid of you, and I'm not!\\
444 - Anymore.\\
445 - Okay, there was one unresolved issue.\\
446 - Charlie, now you're being foolish.\\
447 - Give me the knife and sit down.\\
448 - Back off, lady!\\
449 - Every Thanksgiving you took the knife\\
450 - away from Dad, and when you did that,\\
451 - you took away his manhood.\\
452 - Well, you're not going to take it away from me!\\
453 - There! See?!\\
454 - It's carved.\\
455 - It's carved!\\
456 - It's carved... with my manhood!\\
457 - I don't think I'm very hungry anymore.\\
458 - Lisa, marry me.\\
459 - Marry you?\\
460 - You want me to marry you?\\
461 - Yes! You know...\\
462 - eventually.\\
463 - No, I'm fine.\\
464 - So, are you going to invite me to your wedding?\\
465 - Charlie...\\
466 - Will you at least call me when you get divorced?\\
467 - You'll be first on my list.\\
468 - For what it's worth, I do love you.\\
469 - I know that.\\
470 - Best of luck.\\
471 - Thank you.\\
472 - You look good in long pants.\\
473 - Thanks.\\
474 - ALAN: Charlie?\\
475 - W-W-We're still eating.
\subsection {Episode 11: Alan Harper, Frontier Chiropractor}
1 - Okay, after I get the tickets,\\
2 - you line up for the popcorn\\
3 - while I nail down some good seats.\\
4 - Oh, I-I want butter in the middle.\\
5 - Don't just let 'em squirt it on the top.\\
6 - Ooh, ooh, a-and a large cherry Slurpee...\\
7 - and then you hold the seats while I go to the men's room,\\
8 - and then I'll do the same for you,\\
9 - and that way we can enjoy our drinks during the movie without fear.\\
10 - Gotcha.\\
11 - You're not going to do any of that, are you?\\
12 - Nope.\\
13 - So-so you want to go in there\\
14 - with no coordination, no-no strategy,\\
15 - just, uh, winging it?\\
16 - That's what I'm thinkin'.\\
17 - I have no faith in this at all.\\
18 - Now for her I'd stand in line for a butter squirt.\\
19 - Yeah, she is a hottie.\\
20 - Hey, that's no hottie.\\
21 - That's your ex-wife.\\
22 - Judith?\\
23 - Alan?\\
24 - Sorry about the squirt thing.\\
25 - Wow.\\
26 - Look at you.\\
27 - New-new hair, clothes.\\
28 - You look...\\
29 - Wow.\\
30 - Thank you.\\
31 - No, no, thank you.\\
32 - It's a public service\\
33 - when a gay chick goes lipstick instead of lumberjack.\\
34 - So, uh, how was the, uh, movie?\\
35 - Where-where's Jake?\\
36 - Um, home with a baby-sitter.\\
37 - Alan, I'm kind of on a date.\\
38 - Oh, oh, okay.\\
39 - Oh, uh, is that her?\\
40 - Hi, nice to meet you.\\
41 - Uh, I'm-I'm the ex.\\
42 - Alan, that's not my date.\\
43 - Hey, Alan.\\
44 - Uh, Phil!\\
45 - Yeah, what a coincidence.\\
46 - Uh, uh, Phil is Jake's soccer coach.\\
47 - Uh, Phil, you remember Judith.\\
48 - Well, yeah, I-I...\\
49 - One Mississippi...\\
50 - Alan...\\
51 - What? two Mississippi...\\
52 - Oh, my... God!\\
53 - Okay, we're all caught up.\\
54 - Wait, wait, wait, wait, you're dating Phil?\\
55 - How-how can you be dating Phil?\\
56 - Well, Alan, he asked me out...\\
57 - What about the whole gay thing?\\
58 - Did you even give that a chance?\\
59 - Phil, we'd better go.\\
60 - Hey, l-look, Alan, I-I-I hope\\
61 - this doesn't affect our friendship.\\
62 - Oh, no, call me. We'll hang out.\\
63 - Great. Well, hey, how's Tuesday?\\
64 - Tuesday's good.\\
65 - Judith, how's Tuesday for you?\\
66 - Just walk away.\\
67 - I know you built your sun deck without a permit,\\
68 - and I am calling it in.\\
69 - Alan, chill.\\
70 - Two-faced, wife-poaching,\\
71 - soccer-coaching rat bastard!\\
72 - Come on. Let it go.\\
73 - I'll treat you to a cherry Slurpee.\\
74 - I don't want a cherry Slurpee.\\
75 - You sure? 'Cause I think Phil's going to get one.\\
76 - She's-she's straight. She's gay. She's straight again...\\
77 - Place your bets. Where she lands, nobody knows.\\
78 - Alan, it's no big deal.\\
79 - Women get to experiment with their sexuality.\\
80 - It's only guys who have to make a choice and stick to it.\\
81 - Where do you get this stuff?\\
82 - I make it up.\\
83 - Anyway, it doesn't matter what Judith is.\\
84 - It only matters what she's not.\\
85 - And what is she not, Charlie?\\
86 - She is not coming back to you, pal.\\
87 - Thank you for your sensitivity.\\
88 - All I'm saying is that Judith has moved on with her life,\\
89 - and maybe it's time for you to do the same.\\
90 - I know, I know, it's just... I can't.\\
91 - Sure, you can, and I'll help you.\\
92 - How?\\
93 - I don't know-- by saying things\\
94 - like, "Sure you can" and "I'll help you."\\
95 - Great. Thanks.\\
96 - Look, this isn't just about you, you know.\\
97 - All this wallowing in the past\\
98 - is causing other people to suffer.\\
99 - You mean Jake.\\
100 - I mean me.\\
101 - You are really starting to piss me off.\\
102 - Okay, that's enough help for now.\\
103 - I'm just saying maybe it's time\\
104 - You're right, you're right. I-I-I know you're right.\\
105 - Forget Judith.\\
106 - There's a whole world out there that...\\
107 - you haven't pissed off yet.\\
108 - There is no reason\\
109 - I-I couldn't find happiness with someone else.\\
110 - There you go.\\
111 - This could be the beginning\\
112 - of the rest of my life.\\
113 - Bit of a bumper sticker,\\
114 - but sure, why not?\\
115 - In fact, for the first time since college,\\
116 - I-I can go after any woman I want.\\
117 - Heck, I could take a page from your book\\
118 - and date 'em two, three at a time.\\
119 - Yeah, right.\\
120 - I mean, yeah, right!\\
121 - You know what?\\
122 - I'm going to start right now.\\
123 - I am going to die alone.\\
124 - No, no...\\
125 - you just don't know how to sell yourself.\\
126 - Give me a minute.\\
127 - So?\\
128 - If it was up to them, you'd die alone.\\
129 - Great.\\
130 - Okay, here's the thing.\\
131 - If you really want to play in this league,\\
132 - you're going to have to make a few changes.\\
133 - Like what?\\
134 - Hang on.\\
135 - ( laughing )\\
136 - Pretty much everything.\\
137 - Everything? Yup.\\
138 - The hair, the clothes, the fuddy-duddy personality...\\
139 - What do they know about my personality?\\
140 - Okay, that part's mine.\\
141 - Face it, Alan, you've been an old fart since you were 14.\\
142 - What is that supposed to mean?\\
143 - It means how many eighth graders\\
144 - carry a-a briefcase and a pocketwatch?\\
145 - That was the Esperanto Club look.\\
146 - Okay, well, unless you know\\
147 - you're going to need to shake things up a little.\\
148 - Really? And-and how do I go about shaking things up?\\
149 - Hang on.\\
150 - ( laughing )\\
151 - This one might take a while. Don't wait up.\\
152 - Hey, guess what?\\
153 - Coach Phil made me first string on the soccer team.\\
154 - Is that so?\\
155 - Yeah, it's weird, 'cause I suck.\\
156 - Well, maybe Coach Phil sees some potential.\\
157 - So, uh, what else is new?\\
158 - Mom's got new clothes and new hair.\\
159 - It's like she's a different person or something.\\
160 - But she's still the same person, Jake.\\
161 - No, not really.\\
162 - She walks around the house singing all the time.\\
163 - She just sings for no reason?\\
164 - I guess.\\
165 - I wonder if it's the same reason\\
166 - I sing for no reason.\\
167 - Does Coach Phil sing for no reason?\\
168 - For God's sake, Charlie.\\
169 - How come you haven't changed anything yet, Dad?\\
170 - Why should I change?\\
171 - So you'd look cool like Mom.\\
172 - You don't think I look cool now?\\
173 - No.\\
174 - Well, you know what? It doesn't matter if I look cool.\\
175 - We judge a person by what-/////!s inside them, not by what they wear.\\
176 - Lucky for you, huh?\\
177 - Yeah, lucky.\\
178 - I'm done. Can I go watch TV?\\
179 - Sure.\\
180 - Help me, Charlie. I want to sing for no reason.\\
181 - Get your jacket. It's time to go.\\
182 - I don't want to go. I hate clothes shopping.\\
183 - You can't stay here alone.\\
184 - Why not?\\
185 - You know why not.\\
186 - But I don't have a turtle\\
187 - to put in the microwave anymore.\\
188 - Get your jacket.\\
189 - Fine, I'll put on my stupid jacket\\
190 - and we'll get in the stupid car,\\
191 - and we'll go stupid clothes shopping.\\
192 - Hey, don't talk to your stupid father like that.\\
193 - So, are you ready for your big makeover?\\
194 - You know what?\\
195 - Actually, I am.\\
196 - I-I-I was up all night thinking about it.\\
197 - All night?\\
198 - Maybe your money's better spent on a hooker.\\
199 - No, no, listen, um, I was in the bathroom,\\
200 - uh, looking at myself in the mirror when I noticed--\\
201 - and I think I can be completely objective about this--\\
202 - that, uh, I have a-a very nice ass for a guy my age,\\
203 - and I-I-I think\\
204 - I should start dressing in such a way\\
205 - as to, uh, play that card...\\
206 - you know...\\
207 - for the ladies.\\
208 - ( doorbell rings ) I'll get that. Yeah.\\
209 - Am I lying?\\
210 - Hi, Mom.\\
211 - Oh, good, you remember me.\\
212 - Hello, Charlie.\\
213 - Hey. Mom, right?\\
214 - Very cute. I was in the neighborhood.\\
215 - I thought I'd stop by.\\
216 - Oh, gee, I'm sorry, Mom, but we were just leaving.\\
217 - ( scoffs ): It never fails, does it?\\
218 - Whenever I would like to spend\\
219 - some quality time with my grandson,\\
220 - there's always something more important going on.\\
221 - It's not fair, you know.\\
222 - I'm not the one getting clothes,\\
223 - so why do I have to go and be bored?\\
224 - You don't. You can stay here with Grandma.\\
225 - What? What?\\
226 - Have fun.\\
227 - Wait, no, I'll be good, I swear.\\
228 - Payback's a bitch, buddy.\\
229 - This department looks nice.\\
230 - You're sure?\\
231 - Because this is the top floor.\\
232 - There's no more clothes above this floor.\\
233 - No, I have a good feeling about this floor.\\
234 - Great.\\
235 - How about this shirt?\\
236 - Oh, no, I don't think so.\\
237 - Okay.\\
238 - How about this?\\
239 - No.\\
240 - Good.\\
241 - This one?\\
242 - Hmm... no.\\
243 - This? No.\\
244 - This? No.\\
245 - This? No.\\
246 - Tell you what.\\
247 - Why don't you pick something?\\
248 - I thought you were going to help me.\\
249 - Pick... something.\\
250 - Okay.\\
251 - Flying solo, huh?\\
252 - This is something I can see myself in.\\
253 - You like this?\\
254 - Yeah.\\
255 - Let me see it.\\
256 - ( TV playing loudly )\\
257 - Oh, please, if she has one more facelift,\\
258 - she'll be wearing her ass as a hat.\\
259 - Jake... Jake...\\
260 - Honey, turn the TV down.\\
261 - Grandmommy's on the telephone.\\
262 - ( lowers volume )\\
263 - I'm sorry. What?\\
264 - No. No, I'm just spending a little quality time\\
265 - with my grandson.\\
266 - Oh, he's an amazing boy.\\
267 - We're very close.\\
268 - Like two peas in a pod.\\
269 - What?\\
270 - Uh, uh, hold on.\\
271 - Jake,\\
272 - how old are you?\\
273 - Ten.\\
274 - Seven.\\
275 - I said ten.\\
276 - ( whispers ): If I'm 55, you're seven.\\
277 - He's an adorable boy, and he just loves me so much.\\
278 - Oh, Jake,\\
279 - Jake, tell my friend, Cheryl,\\
280 - how much you love Grandmommy.\\
281 - Go on, darling.\\
282 - I'm ten.\\
283 - How's it going in there?\\
284 - ALAN: Whatever happened to zippers?\\
285 - I miss zippers.\\
286 - I don't know, Alan, maybe there were too many injuries.\\
287 - Nobody ever got their balls caught in a buttonhole.\\
288 - Come on, let's see.\\
289 - I'm just not sure about this.\\
290 - Alan, we're never going to find the right look for you\\
291 - unless we experiment.\\
292 - Now let's see.\\
293 - I'm not happy with visible nipples.\\
294 - Yeah, that's what's wrong with it.\\
295 - That's it.\\
296 - We need a gay guy.\\
297 - His name is SpongeBob SquarePants,\\
298 - and his friend's name is Patrick.\\
299 - He's a starfish and he lives on the same street as SpongeBob,\\
300 - and he's unbelievably dumb.\\
301 - Squidward lives there, too.\\
302 - Of course he's a squid, and he hates SpongeBob.\\
303 - And he plays the clarinet.\\
304 - Both Squidward and SpongeBob\\
305 - work at the Krusty Krab for Mr. Krabs,\\
306 - who's really cheap but SpongeBob doesn't care\\
307 - because he just likes being a fry cook\\
308 - and making Krabby Patties.\\
309 - So... so, bottom line...\\
310 - he's a sponge.\\
311 - Yeah.\\
312 - His pants are square 'cause he's square,\\
313 - and so is his underwear.\\
314 - They're tighty-whiteys, but they're square.\\
315 - ( sotto voce ): Oh, dear God.\\
316 - And he has a pet snail named Gary...\\
317 - MAN: Okay, relax the shoulders.\\
318 - Good.\\
319 - The style suits you.\\
320 - The pants hang beautifully.\\
321 - Oh, dear.\\
322 - What?\\
323 - You're not going to be wearing those shoes, are you?\\
324 - Say no.\\
325 - No.\\
326 - Could you show us some shoes that will go with this?\\
327 - I'm sorry. I don't actually work here.\\
328 - I came in for a belt.\\
329 - Okay.\\
330 - We've got an outfit.\\
331 - Let's go find some shoes.\\
332 - No, Charlie, I'm done.\\
333 - I can't do this anymore.\\
334 - Don't worry.\\
335 - I'm sure there'll be a gay guy in the shoe department.\\
336 - No, I changed my mind.\\
337 - I don't want new clothes.\\
338 - What are you talking about?\\
339 - You look great. That guy said you look stunning.\\
340 - He said "fabulous," but that's not the point.\\
341 - This is not who I am.\\
342 - Yeah, but who you are couldn't get laid under water\\
343 - with a tankful of oxygen.\\
344 - Forget it. Let's just go home.\\
345 - Wait a second.\\
346 - I spend all day schlepping from store to store with you,\\
347 - listening to you whine,\\
348 - and now that we finally found something that works,\\
349 - you want to bail?\\
350 - I'm just don't feel comfortable in this stuff.\\
351 - I knew it.\\
352 - I knew you'd chicken out.\\
353 - Chicken out? I'm not even going to dignify that with a response.\\
354 - At least your wife had the guts to try something new.\\
355 - Don't go there, Charlie.\\
356 - I mean the soccer coach is kind of a sideways move,\\
357 - but you gotta admire the effort.\\
358 - Fine, fine.\\
359 - I will buy the stupid clothes.\\
360 - But I'm never, ever going to do this with you again.\\
361 - Promise?\\
362 - I just hope he's worth all the drama.\\
363 - Hello?\\
364 - Mom? Jake?\\
365 - JAKE: In here.\\
366 - Hello?\\
367 - Hey, Dad. Hi, Alan.\\
368 - Rose, what are you doing here?\\
369 - Baby-sitting.\\
370 - Where's my mother?\\
371 - She left.\\
372 - Why?\\
373 - I don't know.\\
374 - We were watching SpongeBob SquarePants\\
375 - and she stood up and said life was too short.\\
376 - Luckily, I happened to be out on the deck,\\
377 - not doing anything, just passing by,\\
378 - and she asked me to baby-sit.\\
379 - Whoa, Dad, you look cool.\\
380 - Really?\\
381 - You think?\\
382 - Oh, yeah.\\
383 - Very sexy.\\
384 - Huh.\\
385 - So where is Charlie?\\
386 - Oh, uh, he dropped me off.\\
387 - We had a little disagreement.\\
388 - Was it about those dorky shoes?\\
389 - Hi.\\
390 - Hi.\\
391 - Mind if I join you?\\
392 - Might as well.\\
393 - You're gonna have to drive me home.\\
394 - Listen, I just wanted to say\\
395 - that, uh, I know you were just trying to help,\\
396 - and I appreciate it.\\
397 - Thanks.\\
398 - I just got a little panicky.\\
399 - Change is not easy for me, Charlie.\\
400 - Really? I hadn't noticed.\\
401 - And I'm not just talking about the clothes.\\
402 - The clothes are only the tip of the iceberg.\\
403 - Only the tip of the iceberg?\\
404 - Leanne, I'm gonna need another shot here.\\
405 - Continue.\\
406 - Well, yeah, it's like,\\
407 - I was married a long time, Charlie.\\
408 - It's... it's who I was.\\
409 - It was my identity.\\
410 - Married Guy, Husband-Man, Captain Dependable.\\
411 - And I had a uniform.\\
412 - And, I don't know, I guess I just\\
413 - didn't want to take it off.\\
414 - 'Cause you'd lose your powers of dependability?\\
415 - So, Charlie, who's your friend?\\
416 - My brother, Alan.\\
417 - Hi, Alan. I'm Leanne.\\
418 - It's nice to meet you.\\
419 - Uh, I've actually met you a bunch of times.\\
420 - ( laughs ): Oh, no, I'd remember you.\\
421 - Uh, I come in here with Charlie all the time.\\
422 - I always order a rum and diet Coke?\\
423 - Oh, right.\\
424 - So, Alan, the usual?\\
425 - Uh, no.\\
426 - Today, let's try something different.\\
427 - Uh, Charlie, what are you having?\\
428 - Tequila shooters with a beer back.\\
429 - Great!\\
430 - I will have a rum and diet Coke.\\
431 - Was she flirting with me?\\
432 - I think she was flirting with me.\\
433 - I think there was definitely a connection.\\
434 - Alan, you do understand she works for tips?\\
435 - Rum and diet Coke, please?\\
436 - Here.\\
437 - Did you see that?\\
438 - What do you expect?\\
439 - You bought a sport jacket, not a magic lamp.\\
440 - * Men.\\
441 - ( water running )\\
442 - Hello.\\
443 - I didn't see you back there.\\
444 - Oh, yeah.\\
445 - I am ready for my closeup, Mr. DeMille.
\subsection {Episode 12: Camel Filters + Pheromones}
1 - No, if you want to stay in that house\\
2 - and drive that car, then I have to live here to save money.\\
3 - No... I don't agree\\
4 - that he's a bad influence on Jake.\\
5 - Uh-huh...\\
6 - JAKE: Uncle Charlie,\\
7 - I understand the point spread,\\
8 - but I'm still confused about the vig.\\
9 - Okay... vig is short for "vigorish"\\
10 - and it means the percentage\\
11 - you pay a bookie to take your bet.\\
12 - So it's better to be a bookie.\\
13 - Aw, my little boy is growing up.\\
14 - ALAN: Judith, Judith...\\
15 - hang on.\\
16 - I have got to stop you here\\
17 - because right at this very minute,\\
18 - I'm watching Charlie help Jake with math.\\
19 - Well, go ahead and call your lawyers,\\
20 - but I think I am well within my rights here.\\
21 - Well, I don't know what Jake is telling you\\
22 - about Charlie's dates,\\
23 - but he is a kid and he blows things out of proportion.\\
24 - Well, if by "nude swimming"\\
25 - you mean she had no bathing suit on whatsoever,\\
26 - then that never happened.\\
27 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men *\\
28 - * Men... *\\
29 - I can see the clothes hamper was a wise purchase.\\
30 - Berta?\\
31 - No, it's Liz Hurley, but I'm holding water.\\
32 - I'm still sleeping here.\\
33 - Could you come back in a little while?\\
34 - I could or you could get your pampered ass out of bed\\
35 - and let me do my demeaning job and get on with my hellish life.\\
36 - Excuse me, Berta, but the last time I checked,\\
37 - you worked for me,\\
38 - so I'll get up when I'm good and ready.\\
39 - Sorry I had to pull rank on you.\\
40 - Berta, for God's sake!\\
41 - Hey, do you want clean towels?\\
42 - But I'm trying to do something here.\\
43 - So do it.\\
44 - Well, I can't do it now.\\
45 - Is something wrong?\\
46 - I mean, beyond the usual demeaning job,\\
47 - hellish life stuff?\\
48 - You really want to know?\\
49 - No, but I'm up and my bed's gone.\\
50 - Okay, so I told you about my daughter, right?\\
51 - You have a daughter?\\
52 - I have three.\\
53 - Three?\\
54 - Wow.\\
55 - You got to start learning to say no, little lady.\\
56 - Hey, Berta. Morning.\\
57 - Now, you know, I hate to criticize,\\
58 - but the coffee filters you've been buying\\
59 - have chemicals in them...\\
60 - ...and I love it!\\
61 - Get out of my way.\\
62 - So what's wrong with her?\\
63 - Apparently, she has children.\\
64 - And one of them showed up last night\\
65 - and left her little girl,\\
66 - who I have to drag with me everywhere\\
67 - because I can't leave her alone in the house.\\
68 - So you brought her here?\\
69 - Yeah... is that going to be a problem?\\
70 - No. That's wonderful.\\
71 - CHARLIE: Happy to have her.\\
72 - So where is she?\\
73 - She's playing with Jake.\\
74 - Oh, good. A little playmate for Jake.\\
75 - Give him something to do for today.\\
76 - I just hope they're quiet,\\
77 - 'cause I've got a lot of work to do.\\
78 - Nana, did you throw out my cigarettes again?\\
79 - Oh, hell. Dear God.\\
80 - Prudence, you're 16 years old.\\
81 - You want to end up on one of those breathing machines\\
82 - like your Uncle Chick?\\
83 - Mom lets me smoke.\\
84 - Oh, well why didn't you say so?\\
85 - No reason I shouldn't trust\\
86 - the judgment of a woman\\
87 - who's off selling bootleg Metallica T-shirts\\
88 - at a monster truck rally.\\
89 - Mom sounds like a real go-getter.\\
90 - So what am I supposed to do here all day?\\
91 - You're supposed to help me clean, that's what.\\
92 - Here, you can start with his toilet.\\
93 - Hi.\\
94 - I'm, uh, Alan.\\
95 - Hi, Alan.\\
96 - What kind of car do you drive?\\
97 - Uh, Volvo station wagon?\\
98 - What do you got?\\
99 - I got nothing. Not a damn thing.\\
100 - Hey, Prudence, I set up my X-Box.\\
101 - You ready to play?\\
102 - Sure.\\
103 - BERTA: Get to work, Prudence!\\
104 - Maybe later, handsome.\\
105 - Stupid old woman.\\
106 - Isn't she wonderful?\\
107 - Oh, hell. Dear God.\\
108 - Well, I'd better get started on that work...\\
109 - I have... to do.\\
110 - Yeah, I got to catch up on some... some paperwork\\
111 - that has to do with the... the office.\\
112 - Oh, yeah.\\
113 - Your job.\\
114 - Hmm-mm.\\
115 - Your...\\
116 - chiropractor job.\\
117 - Yeah, and you'll be, what?\\
118 - You'll be writing a-a jingle?\\
119 - Yeah... potato chips.\\
120 - You know, the... ones in a can.\\
121 - Yeah.\\
122 - I like those.\\
123 - All right, then...\\
124 - Hmm...\\
125 - I'm going over to... that piano now.\\
126 - Yeah, and I'm going to go to the-the-the kitchen\\
127 - and... uh... yeah.\\
128 - ( Charlie starts playing the piano )\\
129 - ( knocking )\\
130 - ( stops playing )\\
131 - Hey, you play piano?\\
132 - Yes.\\
133 - ( Charlie starts playing again off-key )\\
134 - You're pretty good.\\
135 - Thanks.\\
136 - Are you in a band?\\
137 - No.\\
138 - I used to go out with a bass player,\\
139 - and he wrote this beautiful song for me called "Dear Prudence."\\
140 - Yeah, that sounds like something a bass player would do.\\
141 - You know, I've always wanted to play the piano.\\
142 - Do you think you could teach me something?\\
143 - Nope.\\
144 - Nothing. Not a damn thing.\\
145 - So, um...\\
146 - do you have a girlfriend?\\
147 - Me? Oh, yeah.\\
148 - Big-time girlfriend.\\
149 - We're practically engaged.\\
150 - Prudence, he's old enough to be your father.\\
151 - And knowing your mother, he might be.\\
152 - So just wash the damn windows.\\
153 - I'm not your father.\\
154 - How do you stand her?\\
155 - She's such a bitch.\\
156 - Whoa, whoa...\\
157 - don't talk like that about your grandmother.\\
158 - Hey, you don't know her.\\
159 - She's all sweet and nice with you.\\
160 - Yeah, she's a real gumdrop.\\
161 - My point is, you've got to respect her\\
162 - because she loves you\\
163 - and...\\
164 - I've seen her pick up the stove to vacuum under it.\\
165 - Oh, hey, look-- there's Rose.\\
166 - My... girlfriend.\\
167 - Come on in, baby!\\
168 - Okay...\\
169 - Rose,\\
170 - this is Berta's 16-year-old granddaughter, Prudence.\\
171 - Prudence,\\
172 - this is my girlfriend--\\
173 - who I'm free to take across state lines-- Rose.\\
174 - Oh...\\
175 - Wow, look at that kiss.\\
176 - What? Huh?\\
177 - Oh, thank God.\\
178 - Berta, does Prudence have a boyfriend?\\
179 - Oh, honey, don't get me started.\\
180 - What does that mean?\\
181 - It means if she gets a high school diploma\\
182 - before she gets a baby,\\
183 - she'll be the first one in the family.\\
184 - I'm thirsty.\\
185 - What's to drink?\\
186 - The Cransylvania Goofy Juice is mine,\\
187 - but you can have one.\\
188 - Oh, thanks, handsome.\\
189 - Is this beer for anybody?\\
190 - Prudence, you're 16.\\
191 - Uh, uh, you know,\\
192 - Prudence, the Goofy Juice has vitamin C and calcium.\\
193 - It's much better than beer for a growing body.\\
194 - Not that your body needs to-to-to grow.\\
195 - I'm done.\\
196 - You know, Prudence,\\
197 - I'm the third-fastest runner in my class.\\
198 - Cool.\\
199 - Spring break's over. Back to work.\\
200 - Later, stud.\\
201 - Boy, she smells good.\\
202 - Yeah, if you like Camel filters and pheromones.\\
203 - I got to do some grocery shopping for your brother.\\
204 - I'll be back in a little while.\\
205 - What about Prudence?\\
206 - She'll be fine.\\
207 - Just keep her out of the liquor cabinet,\\
208 - and don't do anything stupid or you'll go to jail.\\
209 - Why would you go to jail?\\
210 - Well, that's kind of complicated...\\
211 - And why was Uncle Charlie kissing Rose?\\
212 - Well, that was, uh--\\
213 - And what are pherobones?\\
214 - That one I know and...\\
215 - JAKE: Whoa!\\
216 - Never mind.\\
217 - Wow. You're really good at that.\\
218 - Thanks.\\
219 - I took some cosmetology courses.\\
220 - I figure I'll be a beautician...\\
221 - or a supermodel.\\
222 - Cool.\\
223 - You want another Goofy Juice?\\
224 - Aren't you the sweetest?\\
225 - That's twice he's done that.\\
226 - You got to admit, she did a nice job on those windows.\\
227 - Jake, you need to get started on that book report.\\
228 - But Prudence is thirsty.\\
229 - I'll take care of Prudence.\\
230 - Come on. Get going.\\
231 - Man!\\
232 - Charlie, you want to...\\
233 - Not a chance in hell.\\
234 - Remember when you used to say that about us?\\
235 - Here.\\
236 - Thanks.\\
237 - Where's my little pal?\\
238 - He has work to do... kind of like you.\\
239 - Aw. Are you going to tell on me?\\
240 - No, no, no. It was just, uh...\\
241 - just an... an observation.\\
242 - Calling them as I see them.\\
243 - Glean from it what you will.\\
244 - What are you talking about?\\
245 - I'm not really sure anymore.\\
246 - But I... I do want you to know that, uh...\\
247 - I understand how... how angry and... and powerless you feel.\\
248 - Believe it or not,\\
249 - I was a teenager once, too.\\
250 - And, uh... I... I can remember\\
251 - what it's like to... to rebel against parental authority.\\
252 - Or, in your case, grandparental authority.\\
253 - Can you put some of this on my back?\\
254 - No.\\
255 - If you don't, I'll burn.\\
256 - If I do, I will.\\
257 - Oh! Judith.\\
258 - What a surprise.\\
259 - Hello, Charlie.\\
260 - So...\\
261 - What's new?\\
262 - Where's Jake?\\
263 - In his room, doing a book report.\\
264 - How can he do a book report\\
265 - when he left the book at my house?\\
266 - That little dickens.\\
267 - Trying to pull the wool over our eyes.\\
268 - I'll take care of this right now. Bye.\\
269 - Charlie, I want to see Jake.\\
270 - Oh. Sure. Hang on.\\
271 - Jake, your mother's here!\\
272 - What?\\
273 - Your mom's here.\\
274 - Talk to your mom.\\
275 - Here he is.\\
276 - Hi, Mom.\\
277 - Hi, sweetie. Having a fun weekend?\\
278 - Mm-hmm. You know Berta, Uncle Charlie's housekeeper?\\
279 - Of course she knows her.\\
280 - Who doesn't know Berta?\\
281 - She brought her granddaughter over.\\
282 - CHARLIE: Yeah. Sweet little kid.\\
283 - JUDITH: That's nice. Have you been playing with her?\\
284 - Oh, yeah.\\
285 - I mean, he has. Not me.\\
286 - Hey, Judith. What's up?\\
287 - Well, it turns out\\
288 - this little rascal was pulling a fast one on us--\\
289 - doing a book report without the book.\\
290 - Oh, Jake.\\
291 - All right, young man,\\
292 - you get to work right now.\\
293 - Jake.\\
294 - Oh, yeah.\\
295 - So, uh... thanks for stopping by.\\
296 - I guess I'll see you\\
297 - when you come to pick him up.\\
298 - What's going on here?\\
299 - Nothing. What?\\
300 - ROSE: Oh, hi, Judith.\\
301 - Did you hear the good news?\\
302 - Charlie and I are back together.\\
303 - Oh, really?\\
304 - Yep. That's what's going on here.\\
305 - Well, just show a little discretion\\
306 - in front of my son, Charlie.\\
307 - Absolutely. You got that, Rose? Discretion.\\
308 - Got it, Monkey Man.\\
309 - I think I have a concussion.\\
310 - Thanks for helping me\\
311 - with my book report, Prudence.\\
312 - Oh, no problem.\\
313 - Fourth grade stuff is easy for me.\\
314 - Should be. You did it twice.\\
315 - Let's go, before we miss the bus.\\
316 - Later, handsome.\\
317 - Bye. Bye. Bye.\\
318 - ( sighs )\\
319 - ( sighs )\\
320 - So, what are we doing tonight, sweetie?\\
321 - Rose, I... I really appreciate your help,\\
322 - but you don't have to pretend to be my girlfriend anymore.\\
323 - Oh, no.\\
324 - Are you pretending to break up with me?\\
325 - ( doorbell rings )\\
326 - 2:00 in the morning.\\
327 - This better be God.\\
328 - Oh, God.\\
329 - Hey.\\
330 - Prudence, what the hell are you doing here?\\
331 - I had a fight with my grandmother.\\
332 - So? When I have a fight\\
333 - with my grandmother, I don't come to your house.\\
334 - I know. I'm sorry.\\
335 - I just didn't know where else to go,\\
336 - and I thought you were cool.\\
337 - Whoa. Whoa. Uh... look, Prudence,\\
338 - this just can't happen.\\
339 - I mean, you're a very nice and pretty\\
340 - but, in prison, so am I.\\
341 - Bitchin' house, man.\\
342 - You should rent it to MTV.\\
343 - Who the hell are you?\\
344 - What's going on?\\
345 - Put down the toothbrush, Alan.\\
346 - We got bigger problems than gingivitis.\\
347 - What's she doing here?\\
348 - Who the hell is this?\\
349 - This is Freddie...\\
350 - my fiance.\\
351 - 'Sup?\\
352 - "Sup?" I'll tell you what's "sup."\\
353 - I'm "sup," and I should be "seeping." Sleeping.\\
354 - What's going on here?\\
355 - Well, Freddie came over to announce our engagement,\\
356 - and Nana threw him out.\\
357 - Really? She didn't take a shine to Bazooka Joe here?\\
358 - I'm kind of more of an acquired taste.\\
359 - So we just need a place to crash tonight,\\
360 - 'cause tomorrow we're going to go to Vegas and get married.\\
361 - Oh, Prudence, that's a terrible idea.\\
362 - Yeah, yeah. If you leave right now, you can beat the traffic.\\
363 - We can't go tonight.\\
364 - Freddie's got to pick up his last paycheck\\
365 - from the Photo Mat.\\
366 - Yeah. $218.\\
367 - I'll give you $300 to leave right now.\\
368 - Charlie, Charlie, we can't let them go.\\
369 - Why not?\\
370 - 'Cause they're stupid, and they'll die.\\
371 - What's going on?\\
372 - Hey, handsome.\\
373 - Who's he?\\
374 - This is Freddie, my fiance.\\
375 - You're marrying him?\\
376 - Uh-huh. Freddie, this is Jake.\\
377 - 'Sup? 'Sup?\\
378 - Hey, I saw the lights come on.\\
379 - Is everything okay?\\
380 - Yeah, Rose. Everything's fine.\\
381 - She's your girlfriend, but she doesn't sleep here?\\
382 - Yeah. What's up with that, Charlie?\\
383 - I told you they'd be here.\\
384 - Come here, you little snot bubble!\\
385 - What do you think you're doing with my baby girl?!\\
386 - Mom, leave him alone. I love him.\\
387 - Give me a break, Prudence.\\
388 - You're 16 years old, and your hormones\\
389 - are doing all your thinking for you.\\
390 - Hi. You must be Charlie.\\
391 - Hi.\\
392 - That's it. We're out of here.\\
393 - But, Mom! Grandma!\\
394 - Shut up, both of you.\\
395 - Can I at least give him my number?\\
396 - He's got your number,\\
397 - sweetheart.\\
398 - I guess I'll take the couch.\\
399 - I'm going.\\
400 - And don't you ever come back!\\
401 - Ready for bed, lamb chop?\\
402 - It was worth a shot.\\
403 - Is Mom here yet?\\
404 - No. Sit down a minute, Jake, okay?\\
405 - Did I do something wrong?\\
406 - No, no. We just want to talk.\\
407 - Okay. What do you want to talk about?\\
408 - Well, you know how I've always told you\\
409 - that you should always tell your parents the truth\\
410 - no matter what?\\
411 - Uh-huh.\\
412 - Well, forget it.\\
413 - Charlie.\\
414 - Jake, it... it's just that...\\
415 - we're just saying that a lot of things\\
416 - happened here this weekend,\\
417 - and it's not really necessary\\
418 - that your mother know about them.\\
419 - So you want me to lie?\\
420 - It's not really lying.\\
421 - When a boy becomes a man...\\
422 - Mm-hmm.\\
423 - and that's what you're becoming...\\
424 - Right, Charlie?\\
425 - Oh, yeah. A man.\\
426 - he has to start protecting the women in his life\\
427 - from certain things.\\
428 - Like the truth.\\
429 - Do you understand?\\
430 - I think so.\\
431 - You don't want Mom to know about Prudence\\
432 - and her boyfriend and everything.\\
433 - Good man.\\
434 - ( doorbell rings )\\
435 - Hi, Judith.\\
436 - Judith. Hello, Alan. Charlie.\\
437 - You ready to go, sweetheart? Yep.\\
438 - So how was your weekend?\\
439 - Uncle Charlie says I don't have to tell you.

1 - Here. Try this.\\
2 - What is it?\\
3 - Just try it.\\
4 - Hey, that's good.\\
5 - Of course it is. It's chicken in frumunda sauce.\\
6 - Frumunda sauce?\\
7 - Yeah, from unda the toilet.\\
8 - ( laughing )\\
9 - Get it, Dad?\\
10 - Yeah, yeah, I get it.\\
11 - I got it 30 years ago the first time he said it.\\
12 - Yeah, but it's new to him.\\
13 - Check this out.\\
14 - Hey, Jake, what do you call the red mushy stuff\\
15 - between the elephant's toes?\\
16 - What? Slow-moving natives.\\
17 - ( laughing )\\
18 - I love this kid.\\
19 - He's a comedy blank slate.\\
20 - Yeah, I'm glad you love him,\\
21 - but you may not want to share your chopsticks with him.\\
22 - I think he's coming down with something.\\
23 - Oh, no.\\
24 - He thinks it's a head cold, but it's snot.\\
25 - ( laughing )\\
26 - Wait a minute, you don't know that one either?\\
27 - Oh, I have so much to teach you, grasshopper.\\
28 - Hey, do you know how to make arm farts?\\
29 - Charlie...\\
30 - Charlie...\\
31 - not at the dinner table.\\
32 - I'll show you later.\\
33 - Hey, before I forget, you got plans for tomorrow night?\\
34 - No. Make some.\\
35 - I'm going to need the house to myself.\\
36 - Fine.\\
37 - Don't you want to know why?\\
38 - Uh, Jake, if you're done,\\

44 - you're going to love in a year or two.\\
45 - Cool!\\
46 - Go.\\
47 - You think I'm just a kid, but I'm snot.\\
48 - Wait. That's not right.\\
49 - Okay. Have you ever had revenge sex?\\
50 - Hang on.\\
51 - Jake, are you in your room?\\
52 - ( footsteps running across floor )\\
53 - JAKE: Yeah.\\
54 - Revenge sex?\\
55 - Is that, uh, anything like pity sex?\\
56 - Whole different animal.\\
57 - Ah.\\
58 - Let me break it down for you.\\
59 - There's this woman, Kathy. Lives up the beach.\\
60 - Beautiful woman. I've wanted her for years.\\
61 - Only one problem.\\
62 - She's married to kind of a friend of mine.\\
63 - Kind of a friend?\\
64 - Well, I never really liked him, but he had a hot wife.\\
65 - So the sanctity of marriage does slow you down a bit.\\
66 - I'm impressed.\\
67 - Thank you.\\
68 - But then I catch a break.\\
69 - He cheats on her with her best friend.\\
70 - She throws him out.\\
71 - So now I'm thinking she's going to want justice.\\
72 - Justice meaning revenge sex with you?\\
73 - You see it, too, huh?\\
74 - Yeah, you're going to exploit someone's anger and grief\\
75 - for your own animal gratification.\\
76 - Hey, I don't bitch about your hobbies.\\
77 - Anyway, she's coming over here on Sunday,\\
78 - so I'm going to need you to be out of the way\\
79 - because we'll probably be moving from room to room.\\
80 - I'll catch a movie.\\
81 - Just mop up when you're done.\\
82 - You got it.\\
83 - I told you, don't take things off his plate.\\
84 - He's coming down with something.\\
85 - Relax. I never get sick.\\
86 - Boy...\\
87 - is he sick.\\
88 - ( blows nose )\\
89 - Well, I can't say he didn't warn me.\\
90 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men *\\
91 - * Men... *\\
92 - How you feeling?\\
93 - Horrible.\\
94 - Is that tea?\\
95 - Yeah.\\
96 - Ah.\\
97 - Look, I know I said\\
98 - I wanted you out of the house for my date tonight,\\
99 - but you're obviously indisposed, so don't worry about it.\\
100 - Thank you.\\
101 - Just stay in your room\\
102 - so the coughing and hacking doesn't kill the mood.\\
103 - Anything else I can do to enhance your evening?\\
104 - Well, do you know how to work my camcorder?\\
105 - I'm bored. What are we going to do today?\\
106 - I don't know. Why don't we make some lunch and figure something out.\\
107 - Cool.\\
108 - Excuse me!\\
109 - Has anyone noticed I'm sick and miserable here?\\
110 - Yes, Alan, we noticed.\\
111 - Which is why we're gonna make like hockey players\\
112 - and get the puck outta here.\\
113 - Get it, Dad?\\
114 - Puck's not a bad word, but it sounds like one.\\
115 - Yeah, hilarious.\\
116 - Hey, Uncle Charlie.\\
117 - Let's make like soccer players\\
118 - and get our big... leather balls out of here.\\
119 - Good one.\\
120 - Hey, you know, I caught this from you.\\
121 - How come you're not sick?\\
122 - I am. ( sniffles, coughs ) See?\\
123 - He's just not being a baby about it.\\
124 - ( knocking ): Hi.\\
125 - Oh, perfect.\\
126 - Rose, this isn't the best time.\\
127 - Alan's pretty sick.\\
128 - Oh, no...\\
129 - Poor Alan.\\
130 - Is Charlie taking good care of you?\\
131 - Not really.\\
132 - Would you like me to take care of you?\\
133 - Not really.\\
134 - Oh, don't be silly. Move over.\\
135 - Rose, Rose...\\
136 - wh-what... what are you doing?\\
137 - I'm transmitting healing energy\\
138 - from my body to yours.\\
139 - ( humming )\\
140 - Looks like you're in good hands.\\
141 - Come on, Jake.\\
142 - I don't think that's gonna help him.\\
143 - No, but it helps us.\\
144 - Is he going to be able to take me back to Mom's later?\\
145 - Don't worry. If he can't, I will.\\
146 - Hey, how can you tell\\
147 - if an elephant's been in your refrigerator?\\
148 - How?\\
149 - There's footprints in the cheesecake.\\
150 - But we don't have a cheesecake.\\
151 - That's the part you don't buy?\\
152 - ( humming )\\
153 - Do you feel the healing energy?\\
154 - If I say yes, will you get off me?\\
155 - ( knocking ): Hello?\\
156 - Mom?\\
157 - For God's sake, Alan,\\
158 - I sit on that couch.\\
159 - Mom, I'm sick.\\
160 - We're all sick, darling, but we use discretion.\\
161 - No, he has the flu, Evelyn.\\
162 - Oh, you poor baby.\\
163 - What can Mommy do for you?\\
164 - It's okay. I'll manage.\\
165 - Oh, don't be ridiculous.\\
166 - Now what do you need?\\
167 - I don't know.\\
168 - I am kind of thirsty.\\
169 - Well, then, you should be drinking lots of fluids.\\
170 - ALAN: Okay.\\
171 - Would you like a nice, hot bowl\\
172 - of my special chicken noodle soup?\\
173 - That would be nice.\\
174 - Rose, call Greenblatt's\\
175 - and have them send over some soup.\\
176 - As a matter of fact, I'm famished.\\
177 - Order me...\\
178 - Order me\\
179 - a turkey on rye with maybe a little Swiss.\\
180 - Oh, on second thought, delivery takes forever.\\
181 - Would you care to join me for lunch?\\
182 - What about Alan?\\
183 - Oh, we'll have something sent back for him.\\
184 - ROSE: Okay.\\
185 - So what's Charlie been up to?\\
186 - Well... what do you know about revenge sex?\\
187 - Quite a bit, actually.\\
188 - I'm still thirsty.\\
189 - Hey.\\
190 - Looking good.\\
191 - That's not very hygienic.\\
192 - We wash dishes in that sink.\\
193 - Well, somebody does.\\
194 - Did the chicken soup Mom sent over from Greenblatt's\\
195 - ever show up?\\
196 - Nope.\\
197 - Well, I'm glad you got some rest 'cause I have got great news.\\
198 - There is no great news.\\
199 - There's no light at the end of the tunnel.\\
200 - There's no silver lining.\\
201 - There's just this hell on earth\\
202 - and the slow wait for the sweet release of death.\\
203 - Okay, let's call it good news.\\
204 - The girl I'm going out with tonight\\
205 - needs a date for her sister.\\
206 - Are you insane?\\
207 - No, but I hear the sister's a bit of a freak.\\
208 - Jake...\\
209 - Jake, go to your room.\\
210 - If you want to talk about sex, why don't you go to your room?\\
211 - Now.\\
212 - Fine.\\
213 - Charlie, first of all,\\
214 - I don't want to talk about dating in front of my son\\
215 - while his mother and I are in the middle of a divorce.\\
216 - Okay, okay, that's very caring and sensitive.\\
217 - Now let me tell you\\
218 - about Revenge Sex's little sister, Casual.\\
219 - All right, even if I weren't deathly ill, which I am,\\
220 - I wouldn't go on a blind double date with you.\\
221 - Why not?\\
222 - Summer of my junior year?\\
223 - The Seals and Crofts concert?\\
224 - You got the incredible cheerleader,\\
225 - and I got her sister, the incredible Hulk?\\
226 - Oh, yeah...\\
227 - She really took a shine to you.\\
228 - Sure did.\\
229 - "Sarah like puny Alan."\\
230 - Well, you weren't complaining\\
231 - when you were on her shoulders, shouting "Summer Breeze."\\
232 - Forget it, Charlie. Forget it.\\
233 - Alan, trust me.\\
234 - I've seen the sister.\\
235 - Her name is Desiree.\\
236 - I don't care what her name is.\\
237 - Desiree, Alan.\\
238 - That's like desire with a "yay!" at the end.\\
239 - She's an actress on some soap opera.\\
240 - Really? Which one?\\
241 - I don't know.\\
242 - The Bold and the Bulimic or something.\\
243 - Are you guys done yet?\\
244 - Yeah, we're done.\\
245 - Now we're gonna get your father back on his feet.\\
246 - How?\\
247 - Well...\\
248 - would you like to go see a bunch of naked boobs?\\
249 - Sure! Charlie?!\\
250 - This was a dirty trick, Uncle Charlie.\\
251 - So, we just sit here and be hot?\\
252 - Yep.\\
253 - This sucks.\\
254 - ( hawking gag )\\
255 - That's good.\\
256 - Get it out now, 'cause most women hate that noise.\\
257 - I'm not going on a date tonight.\\
258 - You don't know that.\\
259 - I didn't start this day\\
260 - thinking we'd all be sitting together bare-ass naked,\\
261 - but here we are.\\
262 - Hey, Dad, want to hear a funny joke?\\
263 - Sure. Why not?\\
264 - Okay, there's a priest, a minister and a rabbit.\\
265 - That's a rabbi, Jake.\\
266 - Oh, yeah.\\
267 - Okay.\\
268 - A priest, a minister and a rabbi.\\
269 - I forgot the rest.\\
270 - I got to go to the bathroom.\\
271 - Wait. You know why they call this\\
272 - a European health spa?\\
273 - 'Cause you're a-peein'.\\
274 - He's gonna kill 'em at school tomorrow.\\
275 - Charlie, I'm not going on a date.\\
276 - Oh, come on, Alan.\\
277 - If you don't do this,\\
278 - then I'm not going to get the revenge sex.\\
279 - And I really want the revenge sex.\\
280 - I really, really do!\\
281 - I'm sorry.\\
282 - It's not that I don't appreciate you\\
283 - pimping me out on my death bed.\\
284 - It's just that... I'm not ready to date.\\
285 - Not ready?\\
286 - Look, Alan, if you think you're protecting Jake\\
287 - by living like a monk, you're wrong.\\
288 - He needs to know that\\
289 - his father's moving on with his life, that he's happy.\\
290 - It's not about Jake.\\
291 - I haven't been on a date since college.\\
292 - There's nothing to worry about. Just be yourself.\\
293 - The one woman who knows me better than anyone in the world...\\
294 - threw me out.\\
295 - So "be yourself" is not exactly comforting advice.\\
296 - Good point.\\
297 - Okay, look at it this way.\\
298 - It took your wife 12 years to get sick of you.\\
299 - All you've got to do here is snow some broad for one night.\\
300 - ( door closes )\\
301 - Okay, a priest, a minister,\\
302 - and a rabbi walk into a barn.\\
303 - It's a bar, Jake.\\
304 - Not a barn, a bar.\\
305 - It is?\\
306 - Now I get it. That's funny.\\
307 - Okay, I dropped Jake off at his mom's,\\
308 - and the girls should be here in a little while for drinks.\\
309 - Is this the sister?\\
310 - Desiree Barrington from The Young and the Restless?\\
311 - Yeah.\\
312 - You want me to go on a date with Desiree Barrington?\\
313 - Yeah.\\
314 - ( hacking coughs )\\
315 - Ah! I'm healed.\\
316 - It's a miracle.\\
317 - Attaboy.\\
318 - ( coughing )\\
319 - Are you okay?\\
320 - Yeah. Why?\\
321 - Well, you're coughing.\\
322 - You're sweating.\\
323 - Charlie, you're burning up.\\
324 - No, your hand is freezing.\\
325 - No, I-I think you're coming down with what I've got.\\
326 - Oh, don't be ridiculous.\\
327 - I never get sick.\\
328 - Now listen, I made reservations at the Ivy.\\
329 - I figure we'll take 'em out for an early dinner, and then...\\
330 - And then what?\\
331 - Hang on a second.\\
332 - ( bellowing retch )\\
333 - Anyway, we'll take 'em to the Ivy...\\
334 - ( coughs )\\
335 - Here. This will make you feel better.\\
336 - Thanks.\\
337 - Okay.\\
338 - Why don't you go upstairs and change\\
339 - because we really want to look our best for our dates.\\
340 - What are you talking about?\\
341 - I'm not going on a date.\\
342 - Yeah, you are.\\
343 - Come on, Charlie. Desiree Barrington.\\
344 - Nominated for two daytime Emmys.\\
345 - Named "most promising ingenue" by Soap Opera Digest.\\
346 - She totally\\
347 - revitalized The Young and the Restless.\\
348 - Occasionally I have lunch at my desk and watch a little TV.\\
349 - Tell Jake I loved him.\\
350 - Courage, Charlie.\\
351 - I was going to suck it up for you.\\
352 - No, you weren't.\\
353 - Okay, you got me.\\
354 - Look, you helped me feel better, and now I'll help you.\\
355 - You want to help me, Alan?\\
356 - Find a gun and shoot me in the eye.\\
357 - No, I was thinking\\
358 - I could give you a chiropractic adjustment.\\
359 - You could also do my hair, but what would be the point?\\
360 - Chiropractics is not just about back ailments.\\
361 - It's-it's a holistic approach to wellness\\
362 - that includes unblocking pathways in the nervous system\\
363 - so that the body can heal itself.\\
364 - Oh... ( blows raspberry )\\
365 - Excuse me?\\
366 - Wh-Wh-What is...? ( blows raspberry )\\
367 - Alan, I never told you this before.\\
368 - Uh-huh.\\
369 - I guess now is as good a time as any.\\
370 - I think what you do for a living...\\
371 - is a total crock.\\
372 - What?\\
373 - Don't take it personally, but you chiropractic guys\\
374 - are just masseuses without the happy endings, right?\\
375 - You think I'm some kind of phony?\\
376 - Th-Th-That my profession is some kind of con?\\
377 - Well, let's be honest.\\
378 - You only became a chiropractor\\
379 - 'cause you couldn't get into medical school.\\
380 - I got into medical school!\\
381 - I just didn't want to spend four years at Guadalajara.\\
382 - So instead, you spent, what?\\
383 - Two weeks at Back Snapper U.?\\
384 - It was two years.\\
385 - And since we're being honest,\\
386 - let me tell you about what I think about what you do,\\
387 - Mr. Jingle Writer.\\
388 - You're not a musician, you're a salesman,\\
389 - and you know what you sell?\\
390 - Crap!\\
391 - Granny's Big Fudge Nuggets?\\
392 - Maple Loops?\\
393 - Hey, hey, Maple Loops is part\\
394 - of a nutritious, balanced breakfast.\\
395 - Yeah, if you eat it with a steak and some broccoli.\\
396 - Let me tell you another thing.\\
397 - You had a shot at a real career.\\
398 - You-you could have played in great bands.\\
399 - You could have been a respected studio musician.\\
400 - Don't you think I wanted that?\\
401 - I tried, Alan, and I failed.\\
402 - Truth is, if I hadn't started writing jingles,\\
403 - I'd be playing faculty mixers at the Guadalajara Medical School.\\
404 - Well... since you're being honest,\\
405 - I guess I can admit...\\
406 - I didn't really get into Guadalajara.\\
407 - I guess neither of us is doing exactly what we dreamed about\\
408 - when we were kids.\\
409 - No, I guess not.\\
410 - But you know, we could be doing a lot worse.\\
411 - Yes, we could.\\
412 - Excuse me.\\
413 - ( bellowing retch )\\
414 - You know what's nice though?\\
415 - This. Right now.\\
416 - Taking care of each other like we did when we were kids.\\
417 - Well, no one else was going to take care of us.\\
418 - We're on our own.\\
419 - Yeah.\\
420 - Dad was gone, and Mom would...\\
421 - What are you doing?\\
422 - ( loud crack ) Hey!\\
423 - Oh.\\
424 - How do you feel?\\
425 - Actually, a little better.\\
426 - Ha.\\
427 - "Total crock," huh?\\
428 - Lay down. I'll do your back.\\
429 - Yeah, I-I-I'm fine, thanks.\\
430 - No, really. It'll help.\\
431 - I mean it, Alan.\\
432 - Keep your hands away from me.\\
433 - Oh, come on. Don't be such a baby.\\
434 - I'm not a baby.\\
435 - I just don't like a man touching me.\\
436 - But it'll feel good.\\
437 - I let you do it to me once.\\
438 - That was enough.\\
439 - ALAN: And you liked it.\\
440 - Oh, now come on. Let me just finish the job,\\
441 - and you'll be ready for when the women get here.\\
442 - No.\\
443 - Just relax.\\
444 - ( car door slams )\\
445 - Wait.\\
446 - ( second door slams ) Car doors.\\
447 - They're here. Uh...\\
448 - How do I look?\\
449 - Great, great. Me?\\
450 - Very nice.\\
451 - Yeah.\\
452 - Come here.\\
453 - Okay.\\
454 - Thank you.\\
455 - ( coughs )\\
456 - Is that the doorbell?\\
457 - Alan, relax.\\
458 - Chicks are always late.\\
459 - I guess.\\
460 - What about that?\\
461 - What about what?\\
462 - The doorbell.\\
463 - Alan, relax.\\
464 - Chicks are always late.\\
465 - I guess.\\
466 - Now that was the doorbell.\\
467 - Uh-huh.

57 - My platinum card.\\
58 - Look what they did to my platinum card.\\
59 - They decapitated my holographic eagle.\\
60 - Yeah, yeah, that's sad.\\
61 - You owe me 74 bucks.\\
62 - Relax. I'll write you a check.\\
63 - Uh-uh.\\
64 - Berta, I'm good for $74.\\
65 - Well, there's an assistant store manager\\
66 - with bad skins and pair of scissors\\
67 - who begs to differ.\\
68 - Well, he obviously made a mistake.\\
69 - Leave it to me, I'll straighten it out.\\
70 - Alan, what do I do?\\
71 - Uh, call the bank that issued the card\\
72 - and figure out what's going on.\\
73 - Good idea.\\
74 - How do I get the number?\\
75 - Uh, it's usually on the back of the card.\\
76 - Okay, now, this may take a while.\\
77 - Are you sure?\\
78 - Okay. Thanks.\\
79 - I don't believe it.\\
80 - None of my bills have been paid in four months.\\
81 - My credit is shot.\\
82 - All my cards are dead.\\
83 - Well, you don't have to worry\\
84 - about paying me this week, Charlie.\\
85 - Thank you, Berta.\\
86 - I'll just take this espresso maker\\
87 - and be on my way.\\
88 - Call me when things pick up.\\
89 - Charlie, why haven't you been paying your bills?\\
90 - Alan, I don't pay my own bills.\\
91 - I've got a guy.\\
92 - Do you think you might want to call your guy?\\
93 - Hey, don't talk down to me, Alan.\\
94 - I'm not stupid.\\
95 - That's the first call I made.\\
96 - And...? And...\\
97 - his number is not in service at this time.\\
98 - Wonderful building.\\
99 - What's wrong with it?\\
100 - Well, the phrase, "reeks of urine"\\
101 - comes to mind.\\
102 - Here we are.\\
103 - That's seldom a good sign.\\
104 - Hello? Stan?\\
105 - MAN: Who wants to know?\\
106 - Charlie Harper.\\
107 - Charlie!\\
108 - Hey, it's good to see you.\\
109 - Come on in.\\
110 - Just don't rip the tape-- they check.\\
111 - So, what's going on?\\
112 - What can I do you for?\\
113 - Well, Stan, I got a problem.\\
114 - Yeah, I know the feeling.\\
115 - Well, sit down.\\
116 - Talk to me, huh.\\
117 - All of my credit cards are dead.\\
118 - And they tell me the bills haven't been paid\\
119 - in four months.\\
120 - Yeah, that sounds about right.\\
121 - Uh, excuse me.\\
122 - Maybe this is none of my business,\\
123 - but how does something like that happen?\\
124 - Well, in layman's terms...\\
125 - your brother ran out of money.\\
126 - What?\\
127 - How did I run out of money?\\
128 - Oh, I knew you'd ask that.\\
129 - Let me demonstrate.\\
130 - Think of this water as cash flow,\\
131 - which for you would be, you know,\\
132 - royalties from your jingles.\\
133 - Right?\\
134 - And, uh, and this cup: your financial well-being.\\
135 - This little hole...\\
136 - would be your expenses.\\
137 - Right?\\
138 - You dig? Okay.\\
139 - Now, Charlie, with most people, when money comes in,\\
140 - it drips out\\
141 - and pays their bills with a healthy reserve\\
142 - for emergencies.\\
143 - See?\\
144 - But with you, however--\\
145 - this is what I love about you, Charlie...\\
146 - ...you...\\
147 - ...you spend it as quick as you get it.\\
148 - You see, you don't drip.\\
149 - You hemorrhage.\\
150 - Whoo-ee! Huh.\\
151 - Look at that.\\
152 - But when the cash flow starts to slow down...\\
153 - there's no reserve!\\
154 - Okay.\\
155 - But what happened to my money?\\
156 - Artists, huh.\\
157 - Where would we be without them?\\
158 - What I don't understand\\
159 - is why you didn't warn him this was happening.\\
160 - Okay, okay, mea culpa.\\
161 - Look, I've been a little distracted lately.\\
162 - Slight problem with the Feds.\\
163 - Are you embezzling from my brother?\\
164 - Embezzle what?\\
165 - Hello!\\
166 - I thought you were the smart one.\\
167 - No, this is a... a-a totally unrelated\\
168 - import-export problem.\\
169 - All right?\\
170 - I just cannot believe one of the pi  atas\\
171 - actually showed up at a kid's party.\\
172 - Oh, boy.\\
173 - This has been a blast-- don't get me wrong--\\
174 - but I have-I have a plane to catch right now so, uh...\\
175 - Hey, I'll tell you what.\\
176 - Just feel free,\\
177 - and browse through all your files.\\
178 - And listen, Charlie,\\
179 - I'm running a little short on cash.\\
180 - So maybe you-- look who I'm asking!\\
181 - Look who I'm asking!\\
182 - It was great meeting you, sport.\\
183 - Ciao.\\
184 - And you were worried.\\
185 - Well, the good news is that a substantial amount of royalties\\
186 - is going to come in in the next couple of months.\\
187 - Great.\\
188 - Problem solved. Let's go out to dinner.\\
189 - No. Problem not solved.\\
190 - But I'm hungry.\\
191 - Get used to it.\\
192 - It's going to take a while\\
193 - to pay off all the bills your accountant ignored.\\
194 - So, until then, you're going to have to cut back.\\
195 - But you said I got money coming.\\
196 - Shall I go get the paper cup?\\
197 - Okay. What do we cut?\\
198 - Well, let's look at your expenses.\\
199 - First thing is, we stop paying your accountant.\\
200 - That's a little cold, isn't it?\\
201 - He's a great guy. I've known him for years.\\
202 - He's just going through a rough patch.\\
203 - Charlie, you're broke.\\
204 - You're right-- screw him.\\
205 - What's next?\\
206 - Um, you have a gardener.\\
207 - Why do you have a gardener?\\
208 - To tend my garden.\\
209 - Garden?\\
210 - You mean the two potted palms on the deck?\\
211 - Water them yourself.\\
212 - Okay, but I'm going to have to buy a hose\\
213 - and one of those watering things,\\
214 - so isn't that kind of a push?\\
215 - Gone.\\
216 - Ultimate Premiere Satellite package?\\
217 - Oh, that's really cool.\\
218 - I get every sporting event in the world.\\
219 - If a kid in Madagascar throws a rock at a tree,\\
220 - I can see it and bet on it.\\
221 - It's gone.\\
222 - Oh, man.\\
223 - We can keep the cable though, right?\\
224 - You have satellite and cable?\\
225 - Sometimes there's solar flares.\\
226 - Okay, you can cut back to basic cable.\\
227 - Basic cable?\\
228 - That's what they get in prison.\\
229 - Hey, whatcha doing?\\
230 - Bad time, Rose.\\
231 - Money problems, huh?\\
232 - How did you know?\\
233 - I bought your espresso maker from Berta.\\
234 - I got a great deal\\
235 - 'cause she didn't want to carry it on the bus.\\
236 - ( sighs )\\
237 - Wonderful.\\
238 - Charlie, miscellaneous cash expenses?\\
239 - What exactly is that?\\
240 - I don't know.\\
241 - Go see a movie, buy a hot dog, stuff like that.\\
242 - It was $80,000 last year.\\
243 - Oh, that.\\
244 - That's women and gambling.\\
245 - Gone and gone.\\
246 - Oh, great.\\
247 - Why don't I just shoot myself?\\
248 - You can't afford a gun.\\
249 - You know, I could lend you some money, Charlie.\\
250 - That's very sweet, Rose,\\
251 - but I don't really want to shoot myself.\\
252 - Charlie, the way I see it,\\
253 - you're either going to have to slash expenses\\
254 - or find the money to pay your bills someplace else.\\
255 - Okay.\\
256 - I'll borrow on the house.\\
257 - You've already got three mortgages.\\
258 - Is that a lot?\\
259 - Not if you have three houses.\\
260 - Let me ask you a tough question.\\
261 - What would you think about going to Mom for a short-term loan?\\
262 - Hmm, interesting idea.\\
263 - Mm.\\
264 - I think I'd rather have a pack of hyenas\\
265 - tear out and devour my intestines.\\
266 - Yeah, I know, I know.\\
267 - I can't afford hyenas.\\
268 - Look, you know I'd help you if I could,\\
269 - but all my money's going to my former wife,\\
270 - my former house,\\
271 - my former wife's current lawyers\\
272 - and all their descendants.\\
273 - So, if you don't want to go to Mom,\\
274 - you're going to have to drastically change\\
275 - your lifestyle for a few months.\\
276 - Fine. You win.\\
277 - I win?\\
278 - What do I win?\\
279 - How is this a win for me?\\
280 - Whatever.\\
281 - I'll cut back, like you said.\\
282 - Now, come on, let's all go out for a nice dinner.\\
283 - I'm buying.\\
284 - Oh, great. Then after, we can stop by my place for espresso.\\
285 - Good idea.\\
286 - That's a money saver.\\
287 - "Save 50 cents on one regular-sized Hamburger Helper\\
288 - when you buy two of the following 10.5-ounce..."\\
289 - Aw, screw it.\\
290 - Hi.\\
291 - Hi.\\
292 - How do you like that cabernet?\\
293 - Oh. It's very good.\\
294 - Ah. I'll have to try it sometime.\\
295 - And excuse me for saying so,\\
296 - but you really don't need the Lean Cuisine.\\
297 - Well, thank you.\\
298 - So, how do you like this...\\
299 - cheese?\\
300 - Oh. Yeah, well, I do a little volunteer work\\
301 - making sandwiches for a homeless shelter.\\
302 - Yeah. I don't know if you know this,\\
303 - but a lot of those homeless fellas\\
304 - like a little snort once in a while.\\
305 - Okay, seek and ye shall find.\\
306 - 24 rolls of toilet paper for $3.99.\\
307 - Now, I know what you're thinking-- it's single ply--\\
308 - but at this price, you can double up, triple up, go wild.\\
309 - Okay, have a nice day.\\
310 - I can't do this anymore, Alan.\\
311 - I quit.\\
312 - You can't quit poverty, Charlie.\\
313 - I want the good stuff.\\
314 - I want cheese that isn't air-dropped\\
315 - into third world countries.\\
316 - I want ouchless toilet paper.\\
317 - I want vodka that doesn't look like\\
318 - Fred Flintstone would drink it.\\
319 - I want my life back.\\
320 - Fine, then swallow your pride,\\
321 - call Mom, and ask her to lend you some money.\\
322 - Yabba-dabba-doo.\\
323 - Who's the favorite?\\
324 - Green Bay.\\
325 - Did you bet them?\\
326 - No.\\
327 - You took the Redskins?\\
328 - Uh-uh.\\
329 - No action?\\
330 - None.\\
331 - Then why are we watching?\\
332 - Beats the hell out of me.\\
333 - Anybody want a snack?\\
334 - ( doorbell rings )\\
335 - Pizza's here. Pizza's here.\\
336 - You ordered a pizza?\\
337 - Charlie, you're supposed to be cutting back on expenses.\\
338 - Alan, it's a pizza, not a hooker.\\
339 - Hey, Mr. Harper.\\
340 - Good to see you. I threw in\\
341 - some of those garlic puffs you like.\\
342 - Grabbed a bottle of house red.\\
343 - I don't think they'll miss it.\\
344 - Thanks, buddy.\\
345 - Here's for the pizza.\\
346 - And, uh...\\
347 - ALAN: Charlie...\\
348 - can I speak with you for a minute?\\
349 - Hang on a sec.\\
350 - What are you planning on tipping him? I don't know.\\
351 - Give him two dollars-- that's 15%.\\
352 - I can't do that.\\
353 - You have to.\\
354 - I can't. Did you see his face?\\
355 - Go.\\
356 - There you go.\\
357 - Oh, thank you, Mr. Harper.\\
358 - These are ones.\\
359 - I can break a hundred.\\
360 - Yeah, uh, I-I-I'm having kind of a cash flow problem.\\
361 - Oh, yeah.\\
362 - Well, we had a good run.\\
363 - Hey...\\
364 - Here.\\
365 - No, keep it.\\
366 - You need it more than I do.\\
367 - So, Deborah said that Julie had\\
368 - an addiction to cosmetic procedures,\\
369 - and I said, "Well,\\
370 - then she needs to go to Botox detox."\\
371 - Everyone laughed and laughed.\\
372 - But of course\\
373 - You couldn't tell,\\
374 - 'cause none of their faces were moving.\\
375 - That's pretty funny, Mom.\\
376 - Uh...\\
377 - listen, uh...\\
378 - Oh, right, you wanted to tell me something.\\
379 - Yeah. Maybe you should sit down.\\
380 - Oh, what now?\\
381 - You got some girl pregnant?\\
382 - You're gay, you're on drugs?\\
383 - Ten bucks says pregnant.\\
384 - Jake, go to your room.\\
385 - I'm giving odds.\\
386 - Go.\\
387 - Okay.\\
388 - Here's the thing.\\
389 - Hey, would you like a drink?\\
390 - I suppose.\\
391 - A screwdriver might be nice.\\
392 - I can't go through with this, Alan.\\
393 - Sure you can. She'll just make\\
394 - a couple of snide comments about your frivolous lifestyle,\\
395 - which, luckily, she doesn't know the half of\\
396 - and you'll just suck it up,\\
397 - pay her back in a couple of months,\\
398 - and that'll be that.\\
399 - With Mom, that is never that.\\
400 - The guilt is always there.\\
401 - To this day, she still reminds me\\
402 - how much she had to sacrifice\\
403 - just so I could get braces.\\
404 - Like I deliberately had crooked teeth\\
405 - so she'd be forced to drive a domestic car.\\
406 - All right, then just drop it. It's dropped.\\
407 - Don't ask her. I won't.\\
408 - Let it go. It's gone.\\
409 - By the way, they're about to repossess your Jaguar.\\
410 - Mommy?\\
411 - Mmm, very nice.\\
412 - How much do you need?\\
413 - I admit that my lifestyle\\
414 - has been a little frivolous,\\
415 - and I probably should have been paying\\
416 - closer attention to my expenses...\\
417 - All right, how much do you need?\\
418 - This is just a temporary thing; couple of months.\\
419 - How much?\\
420 - You'll get it back.\\
421 - This isn't like the braces and the Mercury Capri.\\
422 - Honey, give me a number.\\
423 - I really appreciate this, Mom.\\
424 - No more need be said.\\
425 - You'll pay it back when you can.\\
426 - Thanks.\\
427 - All right, now that that's taken care of,\\
428 - why don't I take my boys out to dinner?\\
429 - There it is!\\
430 - Everything's got a price.\\
431 - Charlie... No, no, no, no, no.\\
432 - You can't just do something nice.\\
433 - There's got to be strings attached.\\
434 - Nothing's given out of love.\\
435 - Everything's got a hook in it.\\
436 - Well, you can keep your money, lady,\\
437 - because I'm a free man, and I can't be bought.\\
438 - Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go hide my car.\\
439 - ( playing slow, jazzy blues )\\
440 - * They're gonna take my Jag away... *\\
441 - ( knock on window )\\
442 - Charlie, can I talk to you for a minute?\\
443 - I guess.\\
444 - How come it's so dark in here?\\
445 - Do you have any idea how much electricity costs?\\
446 - No.\\
447 - I didn't either,\\
448 - but it turns out it's quite a racket.\\
449 - Listen, I know you're going through a tough time,\\
450 - and I really want to help you out,\\
451 - so, please take this.\\
452 - This is a cashier's check.\\
453 - Where did you get a cashier's check?\\
454 - From my dad's bank, silly.\\
455 - Your dad owns a bank?\\
456 - Well, not all by himself.\\
457 - Me and my brother and sister own 49%.\\
458 - Really?\\
459 - What about your mom?\\
460 - Well, she doesn't have a bank.\\
461 - I see. She's in oil.\\
462 - So, you really have...\\
463 - Yup, more than God.\\
464 - Huh.\\
465 - Didn't figure that when you dumped me, did you?\\
466 - Rose, it wouldn't have mattered.\\
467 - I know.\\
468 - That's one of the things I love about you.\\
469 - You discard women regardless of their financial status.\\
470 - Thanks. But I can't take this.\\
471 - You think I'm crazy, don't you?\\
472 - Well...\\
473 - My dad and brother said I was crazy,\\
474 - but I think that was just to form a power bloc\\
475 - to squeeze me off the board of directors.\\
476 - Shame on them.\\
477 - I told them that you'd help me if I needed it.\\
478 - I mean,\\
479 - you're the first guy I've ever met\\
480 - who hasn't cared about my money.\\
481 - Who slept with me because he was drunk,\\
482 - not because I was rich.\\
483 - I only wanted to help you\\
484 - because I thought that we were friends.\\
485 - Maybe I was wrong.\\
486 - Maybe I am crazy.\\
487 - No, no, no, no, Rose, it's fine.\\
488 - I am your friend, and if it means\\
489 - that much to you, I'll take the money.\\
490 - Oh, thank you, Charlie.\\
491 - How can I ever repay you?\\
492 - Don't worry about it.\\
493 - And I will pay you back.\\
494 - I know that.\\
495 - Better I should owe you\\
496 - than my manipulating, scheming mother.\\
497 - That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.\\
498 - Hang on; I'll grab you a tissue.\\
499 - Thank you.

96 - Hi, Dad. Hey, Uncle Charlie.\\
97 - Hey, guys.\\

124 - when we left the dentist's office,\\
125 - and, you know, one thing kind of led to another.\\
126 - So you met cute. That's nice.\\
127 - But you know, you may want to be careful\\
128 - with a girl like that, Charlie.\\
129 - One day it's baseball bats and windshields.\\
130 - The next day you wake up with your testicles\\
131 - superglued to your thigh.\\
132 - Point taken.\\
133 - I'm sorry about that, by the way.\\
134 - Water under the bridge.\\
135 - Hurry up, Jake. Your mother's waiting.\\
136 - Remember, I'm bringing him back tomorrow night\\
137 - so I can see my parents.\\
138 - Why is there a woman's shoe on your floor?\\
139 - Uh, well, um, uh... apparently, uh, uh,\\
140 - Mummy on a Chair is a very complex game.\\
141 - Bye, Dad.\\
142 - See ya, pal.\\
143 - Tell your brother he's a pig.\\
144 - I'll leave a note on the fridge.\\
145 - Oh, God, I needed that.\\
146 - Me, too.\\
147 - It's like all my insanity and rage\\
148 - have just been washed away.\\
149 - That's good, 'cause, you know,\\
150 - all your drugs are on the Coast Highway.\\
151 - So, where can I take a nice, hot shower?\\
152 - I said where, not with whom.\\
153 - You're so cute.\\
154 - Right back at ya.\\
155 - Good, Charlie.\\
156 - Keep hitting on the deranged woman.\\
157 - Uh, while you're at it,\\
158 - why don't you try humping a bear trap?\\
159 - Alan, open your eyes.\\
160 - This is an intriguing, exciting woman.\\
161 - A rare and magnificent jewel.\\
162 - She's hot, and you're horny.\\
163 - I'm saying.\\
164 - Mmm, I just love warm sake.\\
165 - Me, too.\\
166 - Tora! Tora! Tora!\\
167 - You know, Frankie,\\
168 - there are many fine hotels in the area.\\
169 - I can't stay in a hotel.\\
170 - Why not?\\
171 - Wow.\\
172 - That is a very good question.\\
173 - So, uh, where are you from?\\
174 - Guess.\\
175 - I wouldn't know where to begin.\\
176 - Okay.\\
177 - Here I am yakking about myself.\\
178 - What about you guys?\\
179 - Alan, what do you do?\\
180 - Oh, wow, good question. Guess.\\
181 - How 'bout that?\\
182 - Alan, don't be childish.\\
183 - She started it.\\
184 - He's a chiropractor.\\
185 - Really?\\
186 - That's terrific.\\
187 - I have so much respect for what you guys do.\\
188 - Seriously?\\
189 - Yeah.\\
190 - Well, thank you.\\
191 - See that, Charlie?\\
192 - My brother thinks I'm just a glorified masseuse.\\
193 - I never said "glorified."\\
194 - Oh, Charlie, you are so wrong.\\
195 - Chiropractors are like\\
196 - angels of healing.\\
197 - These hands\\
198 - have amazing powers to bring relief and even pleasure.\\
199 - Hey, these aren't exactly hooks.\\
200 - So, uh, do you get regular chiropractic work?\\
201 - Are you kidding? Once a week.\\
202 - In fact, I'm in desperate need of an adjustment right now.\\
203 - Well, let me get my table.\\
204 - I'll fix you right up.\\
205 - Awesome.\\
206 - Do you want me with clothes or without?\\
207 - Are they looking for me?\\
208 - You didn't say anything, did you?\\
209 - ( knocking on door )\\
210 - I gotta go. I love you.\\
211 - See you soon.\\
212 - Come in.\\
213 - Hey. Hey.\\
214 - I was just going to go to bed,\\
215 - and I wanted to see if you needed anything.\\
216 - Towels, sheets...\\
217 - vodka?\\
218 - No, I'm great. Thanks.\\
219 - Alan got me totally jelled out with that adjustment.\\
220 - Man, you so lucky to have him right here in this house.\\
221 - Yeah, I'm living a dream.\\
222 - So, listen, if you need to talk to somebody\\
223 - about, you know, anything, I'm here.\\
224 - I see that.\\
225 - Okay, then. Well...\\
226 - Hey, Charlie?\\
227 - Yeah?\\
228 - I think you're a really cool guy.\\
229 - Yeah?\\
230 - But I'm not going to have sex with you.\\
231 - Ever?\\
232 - Good night, Charlie.\\
233 - Good night.\\
234 - Okay.\\
235 - Round one to the hot, crazy chick.\\
236 - Man, deep tissue massage,\\
237 - pancakes.\\
238 - If you had a TV on your forehead\\
239 - and could breathe through your ears, you'd be perfect.\\
240 - Uh... so... so, uh... so, uh,\\
241 - nobody makes you pancakes where you live?\\
242 - Not your, uh.... not your husband?\\
243 - Boyfriend?\\
244 - Girlfriend?\\
245 - Mother, father, grandma...\\
246 - c...ellmate?\\
247 - Round two. Ding.\\
248 - Good morning, Frankie.\\
249 - Good morning, Charlie.\\
250 - Morning.\\
251 - Yeah.\\
252 - So, Frankie... Boy, that is a pretty name.\\
253 - How'd you sleep?\\
254 - Great, except...\\
255 - I had this wild erotic dream...\\
256 - ...and I woke up all drenched in sweat.\\
257 - Could you pass the syrup?\\
258 - Sure. Sure, yeah.\\
259 - Thanks, sweetie. You're a doll.\\
260 - You know, I can't thank you guys enough\\
261 - for letting me stay here last night.\\
262 - I just wish there was some way I could repay you.\\
263 - Well, for a start, you could tell us something about yourself.\\
264 - Anything, really.\\
265 - I wouldn't mind hearing more about that dream.\\
266 - Okay, I guess I can trust you guys.\\
267 - Charlie... Alan...\\
268 - I know this may sound totally crazy...\\
269 - ...but I work for a secret government agency,\\
270 - and my current mission is...\\
271 - I'm sorry. You should see your faces.\\
272 - You guys are so easy.\\
273 - All right, I'm going to go take a bath.\\
274 - Who wants to scrub my back?\\
275 - Too late!\\
276 - Sometimes I just crack me up.\\
277 - So... what do you got going for today?\\
278 - Nothing. I was just going to hang around the house.\\
279 - Yeah, me, too.\\
280 - No work? No errands?\\
281 - Not a thing.\\
282 - Maybe you could see a movie?\\
283 - I've seen a movie.\\
284 - Oh, come on, Alan.\\
285 - Why are you doing this?\\
286 - Doing what?\\
287 - Why don't you just admit\\
288 - that you're interested in Frankie.\\
289 - I'm not.\\
290 - You're not.\\
291 - Honest to God.\\
292 - Fine.\\
293 - But hypothetically...\\
294 - if I were interested in her, would you care?\\
295 - Of course I would. You're my brother.\\
296 - I don't want to see you get your feelings hurt.\\
297 - Aha! Aha. So you just assume\\
298 - that if we're both interested in the same woman,\\
299 - you would come out on top?\\
300 - Aren't you going to say anything?\\
301 - What? There was no question there.\\
302 - God, you are such an arrogant jerk.\\
303 - See, your feelings are hurt.\\
304 - My feelings are fine.\\
305 - I-I think the real issue here\\
306 - is Frankie clearly likes me better,\\
307 - and it's driving you crazy.\\
308 - No, no.\\
309 - What's driving me crazy is that you fought\\
310 - tooth and nail to keep "the lunatic" out of this house,\\
311 - but now that she's here, you want her.\\
312 - I never said I wanted her.\\
313 - But...\\
314 - you think that if you did want her,\\
315 - you could have her, even if I wanted her, too.\\
316 - Aren't you going to say something?\\
317 - There was no question there.\\
318 - Okay, fine, take your best shot,\\
319 - but let me just give you a little heads up.\\
320 - I am way out in front.\\
321 - Oh, yeah? How do you figure?\\
322 - Frankie and I have already discussed having sex.\\
323 - ( playing slow melody )\\
324 - ( playing stops )\\
325 - What are you doing?\\
326 - I just thought Frankie\\
327 - might like some fresh towels.\\
328 - I already gave her fresh towels.\\
329 - Really?\\
330 - Well, aren't you... Toweley Towellerson all of a sudden.\\
331 - You know, Alan, it's not my fault.\\
332 - What's not your fault?\\
333 - That I've always been more successful\\
334 - with women than you.\\
335 - Have been, Charlie,\\
336 - have been, but we're not teenagers anymore.\\
337 - You know, your-your "bad boy" act\\
338 - just might be wearing just a little thin.\\
339 - Or you just might be a little jealous.\\
340 - Jealous? ( snorts )\\
341 - Don't... ( snorts )... me.\\
342 - Hey, when the occasion calls for... ( snorts ),\\
343 - I have every right to... ( snorts ).\\
344 - ( mimics elephant trumpeting )\\
345 - What? I thought we were doing funny noises.\\
346 - That was an elephant.\\
347 - Oh, yeah, elephant, yeah. Well, it was good, yeah, really good.\\
348 - Anyway, I'm ready to go.\\
349 - Could one of you guys give me a ride? Absolutely.\\
350 - Sure. Great, who's driving?\\
351 - I will. Me.\\
352 - I've got the Jag.\\
353 - I've got the Volv...o.\\
354 - Mine's faster.\\
355 - Mine's safer.\\
356 - Why don't you stop competing with me?\\
357 - Why should I stop? I'm winning.\\
358 - Like hell you are.\\
359 - Like hell I am. Ask Frankie.\\
360 - Why don't you ask Frankie?\\
361 - I don't need to ask Frankie.\\
362 - What are you afraid of?\\
363 - I'm afraid I'm going to hit you so hard,\\
364 - I'll be an only child.\\
365 - Oh, yeah, bring it on.\\
366 - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, stop it.\\
367 - Stop it!\\
368 - What is wrong with you two? You're family.\\
369 - You're brothers.\\
370 - Do you understand how precious that is?\\
371 - Do you have a clue\\
372 - the pain you feel when a family rips itself apart\\
373 - and there is no one to replace them?\\
374 - I mean, that's it, you know?\\
375 - You're all alone in the world and...\\
376 - and it's just so horrible.\\
377 - Um... it's okay, it's okay.\\
378 - Yeah, hey, look, we're not fighting.\\
379 - Yeah, yeah,\\
380 - we-we-we love each other, see, see?\\
381 - Yeah, and it-it doesn't matter who drives.\\
382 - You know, we'll- we'll both come.\\
383 - Good. Let's go.\\
384 - CHARLIE: Wow, nice house.\\
385 - Yeah. All right, I've just got to pick up a few things,\\
386 - and then I was hoping you could take me to the train station.\\
387 - Train station? Whe-Where you going?\\
388 - I don't know. I'll figure something out.\\
389 - If it helps any, you're welcome to stay with us\\
390 - for a couple more days.\\
391 - Oh... I couldn't impose.\\
392 - It's no imposition.\\
393 - Yeah. We like having you.\\
394 - Are you sure?\\
395 - It's settled. You're staying with us.\\
396 - Oh, man, how much do I love you guys?\\
397 - I'll be right back.\\
398 - What a nice girl. Yeah.\\
399 - Of course, we still don't know a damn thing about her.\\
400 - True... although that is one big-ass house she lives in...\\
401 - or is robbing.\\
402 - That would make us the, uh, the duped getaway drivers.\\
403 - Moron accessories to grand theft.\\
404 - That's a major felony.\\
405 - Oh, yeah. Hard time.\\
406 - I can't do hard time, Charlie.\\
407 - I have allergies.\\
408 - Yeah, that's going to be your biggest problem.\\
409 - FRANKIE: Watch your head, sweetheart.\\
410 - Hi.\\
411 - Hi. Hello.\\
412 - I'm Joanie.\\
413 - Hello. ALAN: Hi.\\
414 - Okay, we can go now.\\
415 - Where are we going, Mommy?\\
416 - We're going to Charlie and Alan's house, honey.\\
417 - It's a wonderful place where those awful people\\
418 - will never find us.\\
419 - You were right.\\
420 - We should've taken the Volvo.\\
421 - Are you guys gay?\\
422 - Unfit how?\\
423 - You know... ( squeals )\\
424 - Okay, we got to get her out of here.\\
425 - You can take your damn money and stick it\\
426 - up your white bread, country club,\\
427 - tournament of roses, liposuctioned ass.\\
428 - I just met your brother's latest stuff.\\
429 - Why do you assume it's his stuff?\\
430 - What, is it yours?\\
431 - No, but it's not his, either.\\
432 - Hold on there, Pecos Bill.\\
433 - No, I like girls...\\
434 - I'm just not into eight year olds.\\
435 - The bad news is that wasn't my shrink's car.\\
436 - It's been so long since anybody's touched me.\\
437 - Come on... don't you want to spoon?\\
438 - Coffee? Coffee?\\
439 - I'm the extra guy.\\
440 - I'm wrapped tighter than an airport sandwich.\\
441 - Here, I'm running late.\\
442 - You're going to get laid tonight.\\
443 - Why doesn't she just kick me in the balls?
\subsection {Episode 16: That Was Saliva, Alan}
1 - That is a very sexy woman.\\
2 - Whose car is it?\\
3 - My psychiatrist's.\\
4 - ( alarm blaring )\\
5 - Let's get out of here, Charlie.\\
6 - You're not just going to leave me here, are you?\\
7 - Here we are. Chez Charlie.\\
8 - She's taking her clothes off.\\
9 - Is this a great country or what?\\
10 - You guys are so cute.\\
11 - Right back at you.\\
12 - Good, Charlie.\\
13 - Keep hitting on the deranged woman.\\
14 - Hey, Charlie,\\
15 - you're a really cool guy,\\
16 - but I'm not going to have sex with you.\\
17 - Ever?\\
18 - Deep tissue massage, pancakes...\\
19 - If you had a TV on your forehead\\
20 - and could breathe through your ears, you'd be perfect.\\
21 - So you just assume\\
22 - that if we were both interested\\
23 - in the same woman, you would come out on top.\\
24 - Of course I would.\\
25 - What are you afraid of?\\
26 - I'm afraid I'm going to hit you so hard\\
27 - I'll be an only child.\\
28 - Are you sure?\\
29 - It's settled.\\
30 - You're staying with us.\\
31 - Of course, we still don't know\\
32 - a damn thing about her.\\
33 - I'm Joanie.\\
34 - Hello. Hi.\\
35 - We're going to go to Charlie and Alan's house.\\
36 - It's a wonderful place\\
37 - where those awful people will never find us.\\
38 - So, Frankie...\\
39 - why didn't you tell us you had a daughter?\\
40 - Okay, guys, here's the deal.\\
41 - I didn't want you to know.\\
42 - Okay. I feel better.\\
43 - I'm sorry. It's a long story.\\
44 - We got time. I'm not doing anything.\\
45 - Alan, doing anything?\\
46 - No, I'm free.\\
47 - I was staying with my grandma and grandpa who are really rich,\\
48 - and they don't want my mom to have me, so they said she's crazy.\\
49 - That wasn't so long.\\
50 - Could we please talk about this later?\\
51 - Okay. What shall we talk about?\\
52 - Are you guys gay?\\
53 - Isn't she something?\\
54 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men *\\
55 - * Men... *\\
56 - Okay, here we are.\\
57 - This is it, right?\\
58 - One kid, no pets?\\
59 - Far as I know.\\
60 - Can I go look at the ocean?\\
61 - Sure, just stay on the deck.\\
62 - Okay, who has the first question?\\
63 - Alan?\\
64 - Thank you, um...\\
65 - What the hell is going on?\\
66 - Ooh, good one. Mm.\\
67 - Here it is. I married a really rich guy,\\
68 - and his parents always hated me.\\
69 - I don't know, maybe it was because\\
70 - when we met, he was on the road to becoming a US Congressman,\\
71 - and I was just...\\
72 - you know, on the road.\\
73 - Joanie, get off the rail, honey!\\
74 - Anyway, they were not happy when we got married\\
75 - and they were even less happy\\
76 - when we used part of his trust fund\\
77 - to finance my recording career.\\
78 - You're a singer?\\
79 - Well, as it turns out, no, but, um...\\
80 - ...then two years ago, Brad died, and ever since,\\
81 - his parents have been trying to take Joanie away from me.\\
82 - So, the-the psychiatrist...?\\
83 - Court-ordered.\\
84 - They're suing me for custody, saying I'm an unfit parent.\\
85 - Unfit how?\\
86 - You know... ( shrieks )\\
87 - I'm not a lawyer, uh...\\
88 - but taking a baseball bat to the shrink's Beemer\\
89 - might not have helped your case.\\
90 - Yeah, they'll probably spin that one in their favor...\\
91 - but I was screwed anyway\\
92 - 'cause they were paying him to make me look bad.\\
93 - That's horrible.\\
94 - So, what are your plans now?\\
95 - I don't know. I didn't think past\\
96 - just getting her out of there.\\
97 - Well, you know, you don't have to know.\\
98 - You can stay here for a while\\
99 - and figure it out, right, Charlie?\\
100 - Absolutely.\\
101 - Thank you. That'd be great.\\
102 - I'll go tell Joanie.\\
103 - Terrific.\\
104 - We're happy to have you.\\
105 - Okay, we got to get her out of here.\\
106 - Charlie, she needs us.\\
107 - She doesn't need us; she needs a lawyer...\\
108 - and probably a new shrink.\\
109 - Well, then, we'll get her those.\\
110 - Okay, at this point, I think I'd like to stop\\
111 - using the word "we."\\
112 - Oh, oh, you're going to bail on her?\\
113 - Two days ago, you couldn't wait to get her in bed.\\
114 - That's because two days ago, she was just a crazy stranger.\\
115 - And if I remember correctly,\\
116 - you couldn't wait to get rid of her.\\
117 - Yes, because she was a crazy stranger,\\
118 - but now that I've gotten to know her, I want her to stay.\\
119 - All right, Alan, but I'm warning you:\\
120 - this girl's got a lot of baggage,\\
121 - and I don't know if you have enough skycaps to get her to the curb.\\
122 - What?\\
123 - So, Joanie,\\
124 - what grade are you in?\\
125 - Second.\\
126 - Oh, really? Uh, I have\\
127 - a little boy who's in fourth.\\
128 - So?\\
129 - I, uh... I-I don't know.\\
130 - I thought it'd be germane to the conversation.\\
131 - Wow, doesn't matter how old they are, you still strike out.\\
132 - You know, you are just as pretty as your mom.\\
133 - So?\\
134 - I bow to the master.\\
135 - Hold on. Let me finish... ( knocking )\\
136 - All right, I'm going to say this one more time real slow\\
137 - so there's no confusion.\\
138 - You can take your damn money\\
139 - and stick it up your white bread, country club,\\
140 - Tournament of Roses, liposuctioned ass.\\
141 - Hi.\\
142 - Hi...\\
143 - Really? I'm garbage.\\
144 - Uh, is Alan here?\\
145 - Yeah.\\
146 - Really? Oh, is that right?\\
147 - Well, I got news for you, lady: the term is white trash.\\
148 - Do you know her?\\
149 - Nope, that's a new one.\\
150 - Hey, Dad.\\
151 - Jake, Judith, what are you doing here?\\
152 - Alan, I told you yesterday\\
153 - I was going to visit my parents.\\
154 - Dad's having another colonoscopy,\\
155 - and if I'm not there, I'll have to watch the video.\\
156 - Oh, yeah, I'm sorry, there's just been a lot of stuff going on.\\
157 - Yeah. I just met your brother's latest stuff.\\
158 - Why do you assume it's his stuff?\\
159 - What, is it yours?\\
160 - No, but it's not his, either.\\
161 - But it could be.\\
162 - Says who?\\
163 - Says your ex-wife.\\
164 - Okay, I don't need to hear this.\\
165 - Jake, honey, have a good time, hmm?\\
166 - Charlie... behave yourself.\\
167 - What about me?\\
168 - I am completely capable of having my own stuff.\\
169 - Hi, I'm Joanie.\\
170 - Hey. I'm going to go play in my room.\\
171 - Can I come with you?\\
172 - Whatever.\\
173 - If he can just keep that attitude for another 30 years,\\
174 - he's gold.\\
175 - I'm not afraid of your lawyers or your shrinks.\\
176 - Fine, bring 'em on,\\
177 - 'cause you know what?\\
178 - We're going to run away and hide.\\
179 - Okay, now they're really unhappy with me.\\
180 - Is there anything we can do?\\
181 - No, thanks, you've already done so much.\\
182 - I just hate to put you out like this.\\
183 - Oh, oh, it is not a problem.\\
184 - We have plenty of space.\\
185 - Uh, you and Joanie can stay in my room,\\
186 - and, uh, I'll bunk with Charlie.\\
187 - You'll bunk with Charlie?\\
188 - Hold on there, Pecos Bill.\\
189 - No, it'll be fun, like when we were kids.\\
190 - Well, okay...\\
191 - but just remember,\\
192 - this time Mom won't be around to hear you scream.\\
193 - Why are those people here?\\
194 - Well, they're going through a tough time,\\
195 - and we're helping them out.\\
196 - That girl is really annoying.\\
197 - I think maybe she has a crush on you.\\
198 - Well, yeah, that's what's annoying.\\
199 - You don't really like girls yet, huh?\\
200 - No, I like girls.\\
201 - I'm just not into eight-year-olds.\\
202 - Is, uh, is Joanie okay?\\
203 - Yeah. She fell asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow.\\
204 - Well, it was a long day for her.\\
205 - Yeah.\\
206 - Well, the good news is I think my in-laws\\
207 - are going to back off.\\
208 - Oh.\\
209 - The bad news is that wasn't my shrink's car.\\
210 - Yeah, well, we all make mistakes...\\
211 - ...but at least you made this one for the right reason.\\
212 - You love your daughter.\\
213 - I just wish I knew where we go from here,\\
214 - 'cause I know I seem like I've got it all together,\\
215 - but this is...\\
216 - this is a little...\\
217 - Scary?\\
218 - Yeah. Yeah.\\
219 - Well, I understand.\\
220 - I mean, uh, when my marriage ended, I was terrified.\\
221 - Um, it-it's the unknown.\\
222 - Yeah...\\
223 - Oh, no, don't, don't...\\
224 - Now, don't cry. Don't cry.\\
225 - Um... everything'll work out, you'll see.\\
226 - ( sniffles )\\
227 - What's the matter?\\
228 - I don't know.\\
229 - It's been so long since anybody's touched me.\\
230 - Alan? Yeah?\\
231 - It's been so long since anybody's touched me.\\
232 - How much did you see?\\
233 - Just enough to make sleep impossible.\\
234 - Okay, that's great.\\
235 - I am dying to talk about this.\\
236 - All we did was kiss, but, oh, Charlie, what a kiss.\\
237 - It-it-it was like our souls were merging.\\
238 - That was saliva, Alan.\\
239 - No, no, seriously, Frankie is incredible.\\
240 - I mean, think about it.\\
241 - First, she loses her husband, then she has to fight to keep her daughter,\\
242 - and yet still, she has such incredible spirit, such-such joie de vivre.\\
243 - Okay, would you like to hear my take on this?\\
244 - Is it positive and life-affirming?\\
245 - Good night, Alan.\\
246 - Okay, no... tell me what you think.\\
247 - All right. I've known you all your life,\\
248 - and if there's one thing I've noticed,\\
249 - you are a stone sucker for the damsel in distress.\\
250 - I am not.\\
251 - Oh, come on, Alan, every woman\\
252 - you've ever been involved with has been damaged and needy.\\
253 - Wait, wait, what about, um, uh...\\
254 - Okay, go on.\\
255 - You devote all your time and energy into fixing 'em up\\
256 - instead of doing the humane thing,\\
257 - which is to have sex with 'em and run away.\\
258 - Exactly how is that the humane thing?\\
259 - My way, they have a good time;\\
260 - you have a good time; nobody suffers.\\
261 - Your way, you get married; you take over their lives;\\
262 - they start to hate you, and you end up moving in with me.\\
263 - You know what, Charlie?\\
264 - I think you're jealous.\\
265 - Of who?\\
266 - Of me! For the first time in our lives,\\
267 - a woman picked me over you, and you can't deal with it.\\
268 - I can deal with it.\\
269 - I don't get it, but I can deal with it.\\
270 - I feel sorry for you.\\
271 - I feel sorry that your heart has become so hard and small\\
272 - that you've lost the capacity to connect with another human being\\
273 - on any level any more meaningful\\
274 - than the inebriated exchange of bodily fluids.\\
275 - Boy, leave it to you to take a beautiful thing\\
276 - like drunken sex and make it sound dirty.\\
277 - I don't know why I even bother talking to you.\\
278 - Alan? What?\\
279 - I thought we had a pact to never go to bed mad.\\
280 - Leave me alone.\\
281 - Come on... don't you want to spoon?\\
282 - I swear to God you're going to lose that hand.\\
283 - That's not my hand.\\
284 - Mom!\\
285 - Do you know where Jake is?\\
286 - No, honey, I'm sorry.\\
287 - We're playing Hide and Seek.\\
288 - Well, I don't know where he's hiding.\\
289 - No, I was hiding, and he was supposed to find me.\\
290 - It's been over an hour.\\
291 - If I see him, I'll let him know.\\
292 - Thank you.\\
293 - You're welcome.\\
294 - You're welcome.\\
295 - Mornin'.\\
296 - Morning.\\
297 - Coffee? Coffee.\\
298 - Thanks.\\
299 - So, uh... I thought\\
300 - maybe today, uh, you, me, and the kids\\
301 - might go do something fun.\\
302 - What about Charlie?\\
303 - He's had his fun.\\
304 - Hey, I know! Uh, why don't we go to Will Rogers State Park and have a picnic?\\
305 - Oh, that sounds nice.\\
306 - Oh, great, great.\\
307 - Morning. BOTH: Morning.\\
308 - Oh, man.\\
309 - I'm the extra guy.\\
310 - No, don't call yourself extra.\\
311 - Try superfluous.\\
312 - Fifth wheel, 11th toe, third nipple.\\
313 - Alan!\\
314 - Interesting.\\
315 - What's interesting?\\
316 - This is new for me.\\
317 - Don't really like it.\\
318 - Charlie, you're a great guy, but...\\
319 - No, no, no, please, stop.\\
320 - Do not call me a great guy.\\
321 - That's what you call the schmuck loser friend\\
322 - who has to dance with the hot chick's ugly cousin.\\
323 - What?\\
324 - Well... I'm just having a really good day.\\
325 - Hey, you coming on the picnic, Uncle Charlie?\\
326 - Nah, couldn't find a date.\\
327 - Mom wants to know if you want egg salad or tuna for lunch.\\
328 - Tuna.\\
329 - Me, too.\\
330 - God, she's annoying.\\
331 - At least you're not a third nipple.\\
332 - Jake, why don't you go in the kitchen and help Joanie\\
333 - pick out some snacks for the picnic basket.\\
334 - You sure you don't want to come with us?\\
335 - Do you really want me to come with you?\\
336 - No, I was just being polite.\\
337 - Listen, Frankie...\\
338 - we need to talk about you and Alan.\\
339 - Oh, come on, stud,\\
340 - you're not jealous, are you?\\
341 - No, no. Dumbfounded, maybe.\\
342 - Mystified, astounded, flabbergasted, but not jealous.\\
343 - I just want to make sure\\
344 - that you understand how vulnerable he is.\\
345 - You don't think I'm vulnerable, too?\\
346 - Maybe you haven't noticed, Charlie,\\
347 - but I-I'm wrapped tighter than an airport sandwich.\\
348 - All right, let me put it this way.\\
349 - My brother is crazy about you.\\
350 - Well, I'm crazy about him, too.\\
351 - No, you don't understand. Alan's a nester.\\
352 - He's already imagining the two of you\\
353 - walking through IKEA picking out flatware\\
354 - and throw pillows.\\
355 - Come on...\\
356 - He did it with me!\\
357 - You really care about him, don't you?\\
358 - Yes.\\
359 - You're a great guy, Charlie.\\
360 - "Great guy" and a kiss on the cheek.\\
361 - Why doesn't she just kick me in the balls?\\
362 - Want to play tag? No.\\
363 - Hide and Seek? No.\\
364 - Want to chase me? No.\\
365 - Well, the kids are having a great time.\\
366 - This was a wonderful idea, Alan. Thank you.\\
367 - Hey, what makes it wonderful is the company.\\
368 - Aw, do you always say exactly the right thing?\\
369 - I don't know. I, uh... I suppose\\
370 - I-I-I try to be, uh, sensitive to the moment\\
371 - and, uh, weigh my words\\
372 - so that their, uh, emotional imp...\\
373 - No, not always.\\
374 - Um...\\
375 - listen... uh, Frankie,\\
376 - I-I was... I was thinking, um...\\
377 - we get along so well, and-and our kids get along, and since\\
378 - n-neither one of us really has our own place...\\
379 - Oh, Alan...\\
380 - Absolutely not.\\
381 - But... No, my life\\
382 - is such a mess, and I got to straighten out a bunch of things\\
383 - before I can even think about a relationship.\\
384 - Yes, yes, you-you've got a lot of baggage,\\
385 - but it-it's nothing I can't get to the curb.\\
386 - What?\\
387 - It's something Charlie said.\\
388 - I was hoping you'd know what it meant.\\
389 - Well, Alan, um...\\
390 - I talked to my brother in Seattle today,\\
391 - and he and his wife are going\\
392 - to put me and Joanie up for a while.\\
393 - Oh, you're leaving.\\
394 - Tomorrow morning.\\
395 - 'Cause, you know, I can enroll her in school there,\\
396 - and get a job, and start putting my life back together again.\\
397 - Yeah, no, um... that-that makes sense. Sure.\\
398 - I'm sorry.\\
399 - Oh, no, uh-uh, you're doing the right thing.\\
400 - Look on the bright side, Alan.\\
401 - What bright side?\\
402 - You're going to get laid tonight.\\
403 - Okay, hon, the cab's waiting. Say good-bye to Jake.\\
404 - Bye, Jake. Bye.\\
405 - Aw, man!\\
406 - Charlie, what can I say?\\
407 - I know. I'm a great guy.\\
408 - Aw, man!\\
409 - You know, I-I would've been happy to drive you to the airport.\\
410 - No, it's better to say good-bye here,\\
411 - 'cause LAX is hectic and crazy,\\
412 - and the underwire in my bra\\
413 - always sets off the metal detectors.\\
414 - You know, this doesn't have to be good-bye forever.\\
415 - Once we get all settled, you can come visit us.\\
416 - Sure.\\
417 - Bye.\\
418 - Bye.\\
419 - ( knocking )\\
420 - Here. I'm running late.\\
421 - It's tough seeing her go, isn't it?\\
422 - Yeah, I'm really going\\
423 - to miss Joanie.
\subsection {Episode 17: Ate the Hamburgers, Wearing the Hats}
1 - Hey, there he is!\\
2 - High five. Down low.\\
3 - Too slow.\\
4 - Come here, clown.\\
5 - Upside down.\\
6 - ( woman clears throat )\\
7 - Hello, Charlie.\\
8 - Judith, how's it going?\\
9 - Hey, Uncle Charlie, show Mom how I mop the floor with my hair.\\
10 - Well, it's not really mopping.\\
11 - It's more like dusting.\\
12 - And what if you drop him on his head?\\
13 - Then I guess I will have to mop.\\
14 - Wonderful. Where's Alan?\\
15 - He's in the kitchen.\\
16 - Walk this way.\\
17 - Master...\\
18 - your sexually ambivalent ex-wife is here.\\
19 - I'm not ambivalent; I'm exploring.\\
20 - Yes, mistress.\\
21 - Thanks for bringing Jake over.\\
22 - Well, I wanted to give you this anyway.\\
23 - What is it?\\
24 - It's the bill from my divorce lawyer.\\
25 - You haven't been paying them.\\
26 - Told you they'd notice.\\
27 - I also need you to look this over and sign it.\\
28 - And what is this?\\
29 - My lawyer recommended I take out\\
30 - a bigger life insurance policy on you,\\
31 - you know, in case you should die\\
32 - and can't pay the alimony and legal fees.\\
33 - Why don't you have him frozen?\\
34 - Then you can use him to keep your drinks cold, too.\\
35 - And who's supposed to pay for this policy?\\
36 - You are, and please, try to be on time with the premiums.\\
37 - Boy, my shallow, empty lifestyle's\\
38 - looking pretty good right about now.\\
39 - Okay, well, as long as we're on the subject\\
40 - of lawyers and death, my lawyer recommended\\
41 - that I redraft my will, and you know what?\\
42 - If I die after you die, guess who gets custody of Jake?\\
43 - Charlie.\\
44 - Charlie?!\\
45 - Me?\\
46 - What about my sister?\\
47 - I never liked your sister.\\
48 - Is this the sister I slept with?\\
49 - Shut up, Charlie. Shut up, Charlie.\\
50 - Alan, you can't be serious.\\
51 - He's immature. He drinks too much.\\
52 - He sleeps around. He's completely irresponsible.\\
53 - Yeah, well, you should've thought of that before you threw me out.\\
54 - Yeah.\\
55 - All right, Alan, you're obviously angry\\
56 - and trying to get even with me,\\
57 - but I am not going to take the bait.\\
58 - I will see you on Sunday.\\
59 - Buh-bye.\\
60 - Hey, man, thanks.\\
61 - For what?\\
62 - For trusting me, you know,\\
63 - to take care of Jake when you croak.\\
64 - Oh, oh, I'm sorry.\\
65 - Y-You didn't think I was serious, did you?\\
66 - Uh, I just said that to piss her off.\\
67 - Oh, right.\\
68 - Good one.\\
69 - Hey.\\
70 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men *\\
71 - * Men... *\\
72 - That's not fair.\\
73 - Why don't I get to keep the kid when you're dead?\\
74 - If I'm dead... and-and Judith would have to die before me\\
75 - for it to even be an issue.\\
76 - It-it-it's a contingency plan\\
77 - for a hypothetical worst case scenario.\\
78 - I know it's a long shot,\\
79 - but I had the Marlins in the World Series.\\
80 - Don't tell me they don't come in.\\
81 - It never occurred to me\\
82 - that you'd even want to be a full-time parent.\\
83 - This isn't about what I want; this is about what you want,\\
84 - and you don't want me to have Jake.\\
85 - What?\\
86 - Nothing. Nothing.\\
87 - Why'd you say my name?\\
88 - Get over yourself. No one said your name.\\
89 - So, what's wrong with me?\\
90 - Charlie, you're a great uncle.\\
91 - You're there for all the fun stuff, but I just...\\
92 - I don't think you're up to the hard work\\
93 - of being a full-time parent to Jake. What?\\
94 - Nothing. Nothing.\\
95 - So, if not me, then who are you giving him to?\\
96 - I'm not giving him to anybody.\\
97 - He's not a five-pound ham.\\
98 - You know what I mean.\\
99 - Who gets him in that scenario thing?\\
100 - Cousin Jerry and his wife Faye.\\
101 - Jerry and Faye? Why Jerry and Faye?\\
102 - Well, they-they've got a good marriage,\\
103 - three kids, lots of dogs, a big backyard,\\
104 - and they live in a great school district.\\
105 - Yeah, but I'm your brother.\\
106 - Charlie, it's not... And I live\\
107 - right here-- you wouldn't have to ship him off to...\\
108 - Cornhole, Kansas.\\
109 - Coventry, Rhode Island.\\
110 - Who am I thinking of that lives in Kansas?\\
111 - I don't know. Dorothy and Toto?\\
112 - All right, Alan, let me ask you something.\\
113 - If I'm here,\\
114 - and Jake's in Rhode Island,\\
115 - who's going to teach him all the things he needs to know?\\
116 - Jerry and Faye are both college professors.\\
117 - I'm talking about the important stuff about life.\\
118 - Face it, when the time comes, are those two eggheads\\
119 - going to step up and get your kid laid?\\
120 - You're not helping your case, Charlie.\\
121 - Fine, you've made your decision.\\
122 - Despite all I've been through with your son, my nephew,\\
123 - obviously, I have no say in the matter.\\
124 - Oh, where are you going?\\
125 - Well, Alan, quite frankly,\\
126 - I'm a little hurt and a little disappointed,\\
127 - so I'm going to go make myself a big glass of vodka\\
128 - and sit and think about things.\\
129 - Charlie, Charlie, wait.\\
130 - Okay, how 'bout this?\\
131 - If Judith dies, and then I die,\\
132 - and then Jerry and Faye die,\\
133 - Jake will come live with you.\\
134 - Yeah, like I'm going to outlive Jerry and Faye the way I drink.\\
135 - What do you say to Grandma?\\
136 - Can I at least open it first?\\
137 - Jake...\\
138 - No, he's right.\\
139 - Wait and see if he likes it.\\
140 - Now you can thank me.\\
141 - Thank you.\\
142 - Oh, I'm kidding.\\
143 - No little boy wants a framed picture of his grandmommy.\\
144 - This is for your daddy.\\
145 - What do you say, Dad?\\
146 - Don't push me, Jake.\\
147 - That's my new photo for the Sunday Real Estate section.\\
148 - I thought maybe you'd like\\
149 - a color print of it for your office.\\
150 - Gee, Mom, we've already got\\
151 - the one of you swimming with dolphins.\\
152 - So you didn't bring me anything?\\
153 - Of course I brought you something.\\
154 - There.\\
155 - Crayons? I'm ten.\\
156 - Well, it's not just crayons, sweetheart.\\
157 - It's also a dinosaur coloring book.\\
158 - But I'm ten.\\
159 - You want to trade?\\
160 - No, I'm good.\\
161 - So...\\
162 - where's your brother?\\
163 - Why, what'd he get?\\
164 - Nothing. I just want to make sure he knows why.\\
165 - He's in his room.\\
166 - He's been sulking all weekend.\\
167 - Sulking? About what?\\
168 - Well, it's the silliest thing.\\
169 - I-I-I just happened to mention\\
170 - that in the unlikely event\\
171 - that Judith should die and I should die,\\
172 - then custody of Jake would go to...\\
173 - Custody of Jake would go to who?\\
174 - Uh, actually, it would be "whom."\\
175 - Alan, who gets Jake?\\
176 - Now, see, that's grammatically correct.\\
177 - Alan...\\
178 - Jerry and Faye.\\
179 - Jerry and Faye who?\\
180 - Your sister's son and his wife.\\
181 - Them?!\\
182 - You would bypass your own mother\\
183 - in favor of two potato farmers on Long Island?\\
184 - They're agriculture professors in Rhode Island.\\
185 - Really? Who am I thinking of who lives on Long Island?\\
186 - I have no idea.\\
187 - Well, regardless, I am deeply insulted.\\
188 - Oh, come on, Mom, this is only if Judith and I both die,\\
189 - and we're not dying, at least, not before you.\\
190 - Oh.\\
191 - Now you're wishing me dead.\\
192 - No, no, Mom, no, it...\\
193 - Give me back my picture.\\
194 - No...\\
195 - Better you should look at it and feel shame.\\
196 - Hey, want to play one on one?\\
197 - Sure.\\
198 - Take it out.\\
199 - One-nothin'.\\
200 - You know that Rhode Island isn't really an island?\\
201 - That's just a flat-out lie.\\
202 - Two-nothin'.\\
203 - Hey, uh, I've got to run some errands, so I'll be back in about an hour.\\
204 - You guys going to be okay?\\
205 - Gee, Alan, you sure I can handle\\
206 - the responsibility?\\
207 - What if he wants to go to college or something?\\
208 - Charlie, please don't start.\\
209 - I'll see you later. Hey!\\
210 - Three-nothin'.\\
211 - That was a time-out.\\
212 - You didn't call it.\\
213 - Fine. Three-nothing.\\
214 - You want a do-over?\\
215 - No, I don't want a do-over.\\
216 - Just bring it on.\\
217 - Not so easy when I'm paying attention, is it?\\
218 - Not so hard, either.\\
219 - ( grunts )\\
220 - Ow! My head!\\
221 - You okay?\\
222 - No.\\
223 - Okay, okay, don't panic.\\
224 - I'm not panicking.\\
225 - Good.\\
226 - Ah, you're going to be fine.\\
227 - We've just got to stop the bleeding.\\
228 - I'm bleeding?!\\
229 - ( screams )\\
230 - It's okay... ( screams )\\
231 - What?\\
232 - Nothing, nothing.\\
233 - Just a little trickle.\\
234 - Here, take my shirt.\\
235 - Hold it up here. Ow!\\
236 - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\\
237 - Okay, let's get you up.\\
238 - Nice and slow. Atta boy.\\
239 - I'll grab my car keys, and we'll head to the hospital.\\
240 - A hospital?\\
241 - I don't want to go a hospital.\\
242 - Did I say hospital?\\
243 - I meant Disneyland.\\
244 - How's it going there, pal?\\
245 - You still bleeding?\\
246 - I dunno.\\
247 - Don't look. Don't look.\\
248 - You just hang in there.\\
249 - We'll get you fixed up\\
250 - and you'll be back home before you know it.\\
251 - Just as soon as we find the freakin' hospital.\\
252 - You don't know where the hospital is?\\
253 - Of course I know where it is.\\
254 - I'm kind of hungry.\\
255 - Can we stop for a chili cheeseburger?\\
256 - You're hungry?\\
257 - How can you even think about food?\\
258 - What do you think about when you're hungry?\\
259 - Fair enough.\\
260 - We'll get you a chili cheeseburger at the hospital.\\
261 - Well, do they have fries at the hospital?\\
262 - They have everything.\\
263 - Some people go just for the food.\\
264 - Oh, man, we'd better call your dad.\\
265 - ( phone ringing )\\
266 - Hello?\\
267 - Why do you have your father's phone?\\
268 - I dunno.\\
269 - That's great.\\
270 - Bye.\\
271 - ( siren wailing )\\
272 - Yes. An ambulance.\\
273 - 50-50 shot he's going to a hospital.\\
274 - Hang on.\\
275 - Whoa.\\
276 - I can't believe we beat the ambulance.\\
277 - Yeah, well, those things are just ice cream trucks\\
278 - with blood bags.\\
279 - Hi. We need to see a doctor.\\
280 - Just fill these out and have a seat.\\
281 - No, no, no, you don't understand.\\
282 - He hit his head. He's bleeding.\\
283 - Did he lose consciousness?\\
284 - No.\\
285 - I got a little woozy, though.\\
286 - Follow my finger.\\
287 - He's going to be fine.\\
288 - That's it?\\
289 - "Bup, bup, bup, he's going to be fine"?\\
290 - That's not a medical test.\\
291 - That's how you hypnotize a chicken.\\
292 - I'd like a chili cheeseburger and fries, please.\\
293 - You see, he's hallucinating.\\
294 - Can we please just get him in to a doctor?\\
295 - Well, you need to fill this out first.\\
296 - Oh, come on. This is gonna take forever.\\
297 - Can't we do this later?\\
298 - Over dinner?\\
299 - Now you're hallucinating.\\
300 - Oh, jeez. Come on, buddy.\\
301 - All right.\\
302 - Let's see.\\
303 - Last name: Harper.\\
304 - First name: Jac... ob?\\
305 - Mm-hmm.\\
306 - Jacob. I knew that.\\
307 - Middle name?\\
308 - You don't know?\\
309 - Of course I know.\\
310 - I want to see if you know.\\
311 - You fell on your head, dude.\\
312 - David.\\
313 - Wow, Jacob David.\\
314 - They went full Old Testament on you, didn't they?\\
315 - Age: Ten.\\
316 - Allergies?\\
317 - I dunno.\\
318 - Is there anything you eat that makes you sick?\\
319 - I ate a worm once.\\
320 - No allergies.\\
321 - Have you had any of the following?\\
322 - Measles?\\
323 - I dunno. Mumps?\\
324 - I dunno. Chickenpox?\\
325 - Is that the one with the spots?\\
326 - Yeah.\\
327 - I dunno.\\
328 - All right.\\
329 - We're just gonna vote the "straight no" ticket.\\
330 - Family history?\\
331 - Well, your grandmother's always been\\
332 - a pain in the ass.\\
333 - Gonzalez.\\
334 - Right here.\\
335 - I'm Gonzalez.\\
336 - No, you're not.\\
337 - Oh, right.\\
338 - He's Gonzalez.\\
339 - Okay, you're going to feel a little sting.\\
340 - Nobody said I had to get a shot.\\
341 - It's to numb your skin\\
342 - so you won't feel the stitches.\\
343 - What are you gonna give me not to feel the shot?\\
344 - It's all right, pal.\\
345 - I'm right here with you.\\
346 - Big deal.\\
347 - I'm still gonna get a shot in my head.\\
348 - Come on. Just hold my hand. Look me in the eyes.\\
349 - Go ahead, Doc.\\
350 - Ow, ow, ow!\\
351 - Hey, hey, go easy on the kid.\\
352 - No, you're squishing my hand.\\
353 - Oh, sorry.\\
354 - But you didn't feel the shot, did you?\\
355 - No.\\
356 - You're welcome.\\
357 - Maybe you would prefer to wait outside.\\
358 - I'd prefer a morphine drip and a sponge bath,\\
359 - but the kid needs me.\\
360 - How many stitches am I gonna get?\\
361 - Oh, I don't know, three or four.\\
362 - That's all?\\
363 - Scott Pressman got nine when his sister hit him\\
364 - with an Etch-A-Sketch.\\
365 - Help us out here, Doc.\\
366 - Okay, I'll go five, but one is purely decorative.\\
367 - Thank you.\\
368 - Is this going to leave a scar?\\
369 - I'm afraid so.\\
370 - Oh, no.\\
371 - Yes!\\
372 - Okay, let's get started.\\
373 - ( phone ringing ) Oh, good.\\
374 - Maybe that's your father.\\
375 - Hello?\\
376 - Oh, hey, Judith.\\
377 - No, it's me, Charlie.\\
378 - What am I doing with Alan's phone?\\
379 - Why, do you want custody of that, too?\\
380 - Oh, come on. That's funny.\\
381 - I don't know, maybe Alan and I accidentally switched phones.\\
382 - Why don't you try calling him on mine?\\
383 - 310-Lick-Me.\\
384 - Hey, I didn't pick it, but that's what it spells.\\
385 - Okay, good-bye.\\
386 - Are you doing it, 'cause I can't feel anything.\\
387 - Yeah, that's the idea.\\
388 - Can you see my brain?\\
389 - Sure. Sure.\\
390 - It's a big brain.\\
391 - You must be very smart. ( phone ringing )\\
392 - Your phone's ringing.\\
393 - No, it's not.\\
394 - The doctor's just stimulating\\
395 - the phone-ring part of your brain.\\
396 - Right, Doc?\\
397 - Sure, why not?\\
398 - Hey, I ordered a chili cheeseburger out there.\\
399 - Will they know to bring it in?\\
400 - Oh, come on, Mom.\\
401 - Those are two completely different scenarios.\\
402 - Hey.\\
403 - Cool hats.\\
404 - So, you're saying that\\
405 - because I didn't name you as Jake's guardian\\
406 - you're switching your medical power of attorney\\
407 - from me to Charlie?\\
408 - What's going on?\\
409 - Hang on.\\
410 - If Mom's ever in a coma,\\
411 - you're the one who has to decide to pull the plug.\\
412 - Pull.\\
413 - All right, Mom, Charlie's on board.\\
414 - Yeah, yeah, gotta go.\\
415 - Hey, where've you guys been?\\
416 - Oh, you know, we went and got a couple of hamburgers,\\
417 - bought some hats.\\
418 - Ate the hamburgers, wearing the hats.\\
419 - Okay.\\
420 - You're right. He bought it.\\
421 - Bought what?\\
422 - Oh, dude, you can forget about a life of crime.\\
423 - Oh, my God.\\
424 - What happened?\\
425 - We were playing basketball, and it got a little rough.\\
426 - He fouled me. You charged.\\
427 - Did not. Did, too.\\
428 - Hold on. Hold on.\\
429 - So you took him to the emergency room? Yes.\\
430 - Where the cheeseburgers sucked, by the way.\\
431 - But he's okay?\\
432 - There's no concussion or anything? No.\\
433 - We saw my brain.\\
434 - No, we didn't.\\
435 - We didn't see any brains.\\
436 - Hey, why didn't you call me?\\
437 - Oh, there it is.\\
438 - Why do you have my cell phone?\\
439 - I dunno.\\
440 - All right.\\
441 - You sure you're okay?\\
442 - Mm-hmm.\\
443 - Can I go watch TV?\\
444 - Sure.\\
445 - I am really sorry, Alan.\\
446 - Oh, don't worry about it.\\
447 - He's fine.\\
448 - Yeah, but I'm not.\\
449 - You were right.\\
450 - I obviously can't be trusted to take care of Jake.\\
451 - Believe me, the second you're in the ground,\\
452 - I'm sticking that kid on a plane to Rhode Island.\\
453 - Charlie, let me tell you something.\\
454 - You can't keep Jake from ever getting hurt.\\
455 - He's a boy. Getting hurt is like his job.\\
456 - Last summer he actually fractured his ass\\
457 - doing a cannonball into the bathtub.\\
458 - All I care about is that he has somebody who loves him\\
459 - and who'll step up when it really counts.\\
460 - And that's what you did today.\\
461 - Yeah, I... I guess I did, didn't I?\\
462 - Yeah, and if, God forbid,\\
463 - something should ever happen to Judith and me...\\
464 - I would be very comfortable\\
465 - knowing that you were looking after my son.\\
466 - Dead, but comfortable.\\
467 - Does this mean you're putting me in the will?\\
468 - Yeah.\\
469 - Oh, wow.\\
470 - Thanks, man.\\
471 - That means a lot.\\
472 - Just do me a favor, all right?\\
473 - What's that?\\
474 - Don't die.\\
475 - * Men.\\
476 - That's a very cute hat.\\
477 - Thank you. It makes my hair sweat.\\
478 - Oh, my God.\\
479 - What happened to your head?\\
480 - Oh, I got five stitches.\\
481 - There was blood everywhere.\\
482 - Why didn't anyone tell me?\\
483 - I just did.\\
484 - Can we stop for pizza?\\
485 - I can't believe this.\\
486 - I'm going to have a little talk with your father.\\
487 - ( phone ringing )\\
488 - Hello?
\subsection {Episode 18: An Old Flame With a New Wick}
1 - But I don't wanna go to summer camp!\\
2 - Are you kidding? You'll have a great time.\\
3 - Look at this one.\\
4 - It's a computer camp with a theater program.\\
5 - Ethernet by day,\\
6 - "No, No, Nanette" by night.\\
7 - I don't want to go to camp.\\
8 - If the kid doesn't want to go, don't make him go.\\
9 - Yeah. He's ten.\\
10 - He's old enough to work.\\
11 - What?\\
12 - When I was your age, I spent my summers\\
13 - hosing tarantulas off bananas\\
14 - in the back of my stepfather's truck.\\
15 - Hey, what's going on?\\
16 - I'm going to camp.\\
17 - Okay.\\
18 - Morning, all.\\
19 - Beautiful day.\\
20 - You're in a good mood.\\
21 - Well, I suppose I am.\\
22 - I got a little e-mail this morning\\
23 - from an ex-girlfriend who says she needs to "see" me.\\
24 - No kidding.\\
25 - I wonder if she's "knocked up."\\
26 - Nobody's knocked up.\\
27 - I haven't heard from her in five years.\\
28 - So she's bringing you a four-year-old.\\
29 - Believe me, nobody's bringing anything.\\
30 - Remember Jill?\\
31 - Jill the slob?\\
32 - Yeah, but do you remember how hot she was?\\
33 - Yeah, well, sure, she was a tight unit,\\
34 - but she left dirty dishes everywhere.\\
35 - Swear to God,\\
36 - this broad left half-eaten casseroles\\
37 - in the bathtub.\\
38 - So?\\
39 - With a body like that\\
40 - she could drink out of the toilet if she wanted to.\\
41 - Wait a minute.\\
42 - Isn't she the one who dumped you?\\
43 - Somebody dumped Charlie?\\
44 - Broke his little black heart.\\
45 - It was pathetic.\\
46 - She didn't dump me.\\
47 - She had personal problems\\
48 - and moved to Europe to, you know, find herself.\\
49 - Berta?\\
50 - He wept.\\
51 - I did not.\\
52 - I felt the appropriate amount of sadness\\
53 - for a good relationship that had run its course.\\
54 - I had to carry him to bed three nights in a row.\\
55 - I was perfectly happy sleeping under the deck.\\
56 - You bring her home, you clean up after her.\\
57 - Thank God you never get any.\\
58 - Hey.\\
59 - Hey.\\
60 - What can I get for you?\\
61 - White wine, please.\\
62 - Maybe a Chablis.\\
63 - You know, uh, make it a beer.\\
64 - Light beer.\\
65 - Just a beer.\\
66 - Another one?\\
67 - Might as well.\\
68 - Looks like I'm getting stood up.\\
69 - Chicks, huh?\\
70 - Maybe she's got a good reason.\\
71 - I'll tell you what, if it were any other woman\\
72 - I'd have been out of here an hour ago.\\
73 - Really?\\
74 - Oh, yeah.\\
75 - This girl... this girl is something different.\\
76 - How so?\\
77 - Well, did you ever go out with somebody\\
78 - who was not only great in bed\\
79 - but also like a really cool friend?\\
80 - Yeah, once.\\
81 - In fact, now that I think about it,\\
82 - the friendship was the best part of our relationship.\\
83 - No kidding.\\
84 - Yeah, the sex was a little weird.\\
85 - We would, like, wrestle to get on top.\\
86 - She would actually get angry if she wasn't up there.\\
87 - Maybe she had a good reason.\\
88 - Maybe.\\
89 - Charlie, look at me.\\
90 - Okay, how do you know my name?\\
91 - It's me.\\
92 - Me, who?\\
93 - No...\\
94 - Yes.\\
95 - Jill?\\
96 - Bill.\\
97 - No...\\
98 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
99 - * Men... *\\
100 - We're gonna need two shots of tequila.\\
101 - That's okay. I don't want...\\
102 - They're not for you.\\
103 - Wow, this girl you're waiting for really must be something.\\
104 - Just serve the hooch and mind your own business.\\
105 - Listen, Charlie, I know...\\
106 - Hang on.\\
107 - Okay, go.\\
108 - I know this comes as a shock to you.\\
109 - Please, if I had a nickel for every time a girl dumped me,\\
110 - disappeared for five years and came back as a guy,\\
111 - I'd have a nickel!\\
112 - Keep 'em coming.\\
113 - I think I owe you an explanation.\\
114 - Who pays the nickel, by the way?\\
115 - Is it you or just out of some general fund?\\
116 - Charlie...\\
117 - Yeah?\\
118 - Remember when we broke up,\\
119 - and I said it's not you, it's me?\\
120 - Yes. And I believe you now.\\
121 - I was so mixed up and unhappy as a woman.\\
122 - So? I know lots of mixed-up, unhappy women.\\
123 - They go shopping and eat ice cream.\\
124 - Did you even try that?\\
125 - I tried everything, Charlie.\\
126 - But the truth is,\\
127 - I was always a man trapped in a woman's body.\\
128 - No, no, no. No, no, no.\\
129 - No, I'm not buying this.\\
130 - No. If you were really a man back then\\
131 - you would have jumped at that three-way\\
132 - with the cocktail waitress in Carmel.\\
133 - I begged you.\\
134 - You haven't changed.\\
135 - Wish I could say the same.\\
136 - Charlie, how could I have explained it to you back then?\\
137 - I couldn't even explain it to myself.\\
138 - Okay, well, now you've explained.\\
139 - Thank you.\\
140 - Nice to see you again.\\
141 - Good luck with the penis.\\
142 - Charlie... Wait.\\
143 - A few minutes ago, you said I was a really cool friend.\\
144 - Uh, yeah.\\
145 - Well, I'm back in L.A.,\\
146 - and I'm kind of starting a new life.\\
147 - Uh-huh.\\
148 - And I could really use a friend.\\
149 - Oh, boy.\\
150 - It's just, you know, I'm completely alone,\\
151 - and I'm... I'm really scared.\\
152 - Aw, jeez.\\
153 - It's going to be okay, Jill.\\
154 - Bill.\\
155 - Yeah, Bill, whatever.\\
156 - It's okay.\\
157 - I'm still your friend.\\
158 - Oh, Charlie, you're the best.\\
159 - I wish I could've loved you\\
160 - the way you deserve to be loved.\\
161 - * Men... *\\
162 - Thanks for the ride, Bill.\\
163 - You're a good friend.\\
164 - Hey, you called me "Bill."\\
165 - Well, that's your name, lady.\\
166 - Just like old times, huh?\\
167 - Drag your drunk-ass home, take you upstairs,\\
168 - get you undressed and...\\
169 - Hey.\\
170 - Oh, Alan.\\
171 - You never met my brother, Alan, did you?\\
172 - No, I never met anyone in your family, Charlie.\\
173 - Yeah, well, different rules now.\\
174 - Bill, this is my brother, Alan.\\
175 - Alan, this is my old... friend, Bill.\\
176 - Nice to meet you, Bill.\\
177 - Same here.\\
178 - I thought you were going to hook up\\
179 - with that old girlfriend who wanted to "see" you.\\
180 - Oh, right.\\
181 - Turns out she changed her... "mind."\\
182 - Anyway, I ran into my old friend Bill here.\\
183 - So, uh, stood up by Jill, ran into Bill.\\
184 - That's funny.\\
185 - You have a sick sense of humor, Alan.\\
186 - The house is clean.\\
187 - I'm going home now.\\
188 - I'll pick that up on Monday.\\
189 - Sorry, that's mine.\\
190 - Hi.\\
191 - Hi.\\
192 - Okay, I'm outta here.\\
193 - So, Bill, uh, you from around here?\\
194 - I was, but I moved away for a couple years.\\
195 - Now I'm planning on moving back, and buying a place.\\
196 - Hello.\\
197 - Evelyn Harper, Evelyn Harper Real Estate.\\
198 - Oh, yeah, Mom's here.\\
199 - No problem. I'm drunk.\\
200 - I'm Bill Shraeder.\\
201 - I'm a friend of Charlie's.\\
202 - No need to apologize.\\
203 - So, are you interested in renting or buying?\\
204 - Buying.\\
205 - Excellent.\\
206 - Price range?\\
207 - I'm flexible.\\
208 - I'll bet you are.\\
209 - But I was talking money.\\
210 - Well, so was I.\\
211 - Ooh, sexy and liquid.\\
212 - I like that in a man.\\
213 - Nice guy.\\
214 - Poker buddy?\\
215 - Used to.\\
216 - And don't call me "buddy."\\
217 - There it is.\\
218 - Well, thank you so much\\
219 - for showing me the condos, Evelyn.\\
220 - Thank you for dinner, Bill.\\
221 - Thank you for dessert.\\
222 - Shall we go to my place for coffee and cigars?\\
223 - I don't smoke.\\
224 - You will when I'm done with you.\\
225 - Oh, my God.\\
226 - He's, like, half her age.\\
227 - Yeah, that's the problem.\\
228 - * Men... *\\
229 - I am trying, Charlie.\\
230 - I-I am trying to be open-minded, but our mom\\
231 - with a guy who's younger than us--\\
232 - It-it's just freaking me out.\\
233 - Trust me, Alan.\\
234 - Very soon, you're going to be looking back\\
235 - on this moment with fond nostalgia.\\
236 - What do you mean?\\
237 - Look.\\
238 - Who's this?\\
239 - This is Jill.\\
240 - Oh, the-the woman who dumped you?\\
241 - Get over that. Nobody dumped me.\\
242 - All right, I'm sorry.\\
243 - Um, why are we looking at Jill?\\
244 - Just look at it.\\
245 - Okay. She's cute.\\
246 - Very tall... broad shoulders...\\
247 - Holy mother of God!\\
248 - Welcome to the Matrix.\\
249 - So-so-so-so, Jill is-is-is...\\
250 - Yep.\\
251 - And-and-and-and you and-and Jill used to...\\
252 - Every chance we got.\\
253 - And-and-and Mom is...\\
254 - At this very moment.\\
255 - Holy mother of God!\\
256 - What are you guys yelling about?\\
257 - Go to bed. Go to bed. Go to bed.\\
258 - Do you realize what this means?\\
259 - Yes. I slept with a woman who wanted to be a man...\\
260 - or... I slept with a man in a woman's body...\\
261 - or-- and this is my new favorite,\\
262 - and the title of my autobiography--\\
263 - my mom and I slept with the same dude.\\
264 - Ex-ex-excuse me, could we just we table that for now\\
265 - and discuss how this impacts on our mother?\\
266 - Why? The damage has been done.\\
267 - All that's left to do now\\
268 - is drink until the part of the brain\\
269 - that creates mental pictures is dead.\\
270 - No, Charlie, stay with me.\\
271 - Do you think I'm gay?\\
272 - For God's sake, Charlie, this is not about you!\\
273 - I like musical theater.\\
274 - Maybe all these years,\\
275 - I've been pathologically chasing women\\
276 - because I've been overcompensating.\\
277 - You know, I've often thought that.\\
278 - What?! I'm agreeing with you. What do you want to hear?\\
279 - I want you to tell me that there is no chance\\
280 - that either of us will ever have to call\\
281 - a woman I slept with "Daddy."\\
282 - Jill the slob.\\
283 - Uh... gadzooks.\\
284 - Morning.\\
285 - Morning.\\
286 - Morning.\\
287 - Morning.\\
288 - So, how was your weekend?\\
289 - Fine. Okay.\\
290 - Nothing exciting happening in your world, Charlie?\\
291 - Like what?\\
292 - Oh, I don't know.\\
293 - Go to a fun party? See a great movie?\\
294 - Run into an old flame with a new wick?\\
295 - What are the odds, huh?\\
296 - One brother turns 'em gay; the other turns 'em guy.\\
297 - If you don't mind, Berta, I'd rather not talk about it.\\
298 - Okay.\\
299 - I'll fix you something to eat.\\
300 - How 'bout a sausage link and a couple eggs?\\
301 - EVELYN: Hello, anybody home?\\
302 - Oh, no. Oh, no.\\
303 - Charlie,\\
304 - I need to talk to you about your friend Bill.\\
305 - Oh, boy.\\
306 - Oh, boy!\\
307 - You know, I-I'd really rather not discuss this\\
308 - in front of the help.\\
309 - Uh, Berta, could you give us some privacy?\\
310 - Hell, no.\\
311 - Sorry.\\
312 - Um...\\
313 - Bill and I shared something very special\\
314 - this weekend.\\
315 - I realize\\
316 - that might be awkward for you,\\
317 - so I thought I'd come by to discuss it.\\
318 - Well, that's nice, Mom.\\
319 - Isn't that nice, Alan?\\
320 - Um, you're the expert, Charlie.\\
321 - Is it too early to start drinking?\\
322 - What is that supposed to mean?\\
323 - Mom, uh...\\
324 - how much do you know about Bill?\\
325 - Charlie,\\
326 - I have no doubt that you two shared\\
327 - some sordid adventures together,\\
328 - but that's the past.\\
329 - The only thing that matters\\
330 - to me now is that Bill is a handsome,\\
331 - sensitive, wonderful man.\\
332 - ( giggling )\\
333 - Excuse me?\\
334 - Nothing. I'm just happy to be here.\\
335 - Frankly, Mom, I am a little uncomfortable with this.\\
336 - A little? I think I'm having a stroke.\\
337 - I knew it.\\
338 - You hypocrites.\\
339 - It's perfectly\\
340 - all right for you to date younger women,\\
341 - but when a mature woman gets involved with a younger man,\\
342 - somehow it's scandalous and immoral.\\
343 - No, no, no, Mom, it's not the age.\\
344 - Well, what then?\\
345 - Because he's your friend?\\
346 - I didn't object when you dated that friend of mine.\\
347 - You what?\\
348 - One time. I was 19,\\
349 - and she was a very doable 42.\\
350 - And if you heard how she talked about you,\\
351 - you wouldn't call her a friend.\\
352 - I've heard enough.\\
353 - I'm going to continue to see Bill,\\
354 - and if you don't like it, that's just too bad.\\
355 - Wait, wait, wait, Mom.\\
356 - I-I-I thought you came here so that we could discuss it.\\
357 - Oh, please, I came here to brag.\\
358 - I just needed an opening line.\\
359 - Wow.\\
360 - She doesn't know.\\
361 - Yeah, well, someone's going to have to tell her.\\
362 - BERTA: Charlie?\\
363 - What?\\
364 - I will clean your house free\\
365 - for a month if you let me do it.\\
366 - Come on, it is a little funny.\\
367 - I mean, when we were dating,\\
368 - you never wanted me to meet your mom.\\
369 - Maybe not so much funny as ironic.\\
370 - Look, Jill, Bill...\\
371 - You're angry with me.\\
372 - Not angry. Not thrilled.\\
373 - Charlie, I never planned for this to happen.\\
374 - I mean, your mom and I just hit it off.\\
375 - She's-she's beautiful, intelligent, self-assured,\\
376 - and, man, she's just exploding with this raw sexuality.\\
377 - Whoa, whoa, whoa... listen, fella.\\
378 - Uh, I don't know what they told you in orientation,\\
379 - but... rule number one:\\
380 - when a guy talks like that about another guy's mom,\\
381 - he's likely to get his ass kicked.\\
382 - Oh, come on, Charlie, please.\\
383 - Don't-don't get all macho on me.\\
384 - You couldn't take me when I was a girl.\\
385 - Don't change the subject.\\
386 - We're talking about you and my mother.\\
387 - Why haven't you told her?\\
388 - Told her what?\\
389 - That you're lactose-intolerant. What do you think?!\\
390 - Stop yelling at me.\\
391 - I'm not yelling at you!\\
392 - Yes, you are!\\
393 - Okay, I'm sorry.\\
394 - Look, you need to understand that\\
395 - no matter how much I hate my mother,\\
396 - I love my mother, and I don't want to see her get hurt...\\
397 - so you got to tell her before she finds out the hard way...\\
398 - ...or whatever way she finds out.\\
399 - But what if she rejects me?\\
400 - Well, welcome to the rodeo, Calamity Jane.\\
401 - You want to be a real man?\\
402 - Grab hold of those store-bought balls\\
403 - and just tell the truth.\\
404 - You're right.\\
405 - We still friends?\\
406 - Yeah. Sure.\\
407 - I'm glad.\\
408 - They're made out of Teflon, you know.\\
409 - Okay,\\
410 - rule number two...\\
411 - BERTA: What'd I miss?\\
412 - Nothing. I don't think he's told her yet.\\
413 - Hey, what are you doing here?\\
414 - You finished cleaning hours ago.\\
415 - I took a nap in the laundry room\\
416 - so I'd be fresh for the big show.\\
417 - Okay...\\
418 - I think he's going for it.\\
419 - Wow. That went surprisingly well.\\
420 - Well, damn.\\
421 - Wait a minute. What's he doing?\\
422 - There you go.\\
423 - See you tomorrow.\\
424 - * Men. *\\
425 - Okay, uh, we'll make a list.\\
426 - The, uh, the pros... and cons\\
427 - of continuing your relationship with Bill.\\
428 - Mom?\\
429 - Well, uh... he certainly understands women.\\
430 - O-Okay, that's, uh, that's a pro.\\
431 - He used to be a woman!\\
432 - I'll put con.\\
433 - Uh... he slept with Charlie when he was a woman.\\
434 - Pro. No, wait, con. Definitely con.\\
435 - He knows what I like in bed.\\
436 - He knows what I like in bed!\\
437 - We'll call that a wash.\\
438 - What's the score?\\
439 - Uh, it's about even.\\
440 - He's gorgeous.\\
441 - He can afford beachfront property,\\
442 - and he's got a trunk full of fabulous shoes\\
443 - that fit me perfectly.\\
444 - Don't wait up.\\
445 - Mommy's got a date.
\subsection {Episode 19: I Remember the Coatroom, I Just Don't Remember You}
1 - Okay, how about this?\\
2 - If you let me have Jake this Easter,\\
3 - you can have him the Fourth of July and Labor Day.\\
4 - No, No, that doesn't work for me at all.\\
5 - Uh, how about I give you all the Jewish holidays?\\
6 - When did we become Jewish, Alan?\\
7 - They're still holidays.\\
8 - L'chaim.\\
9 - Your brother's a schmuck.\\
10 - What are they arguing about now?\\
11 - It's actually kind of ironic.\\
12 - They're arguing about who gets you on what days.\\
13 - That is ironic.\\
14 - You know what ironic means?\\
15 - No, but I trust you.\\
16 - What's ironic is,\\
17 - while they're arguing about who gets you, I get you.\\
18 - And you know what?\\
19 - It's not such a big deal.\\
20 - Ha, ha.\\
21 - No offense, but let's face it, you're ten.\\
22 - I can't take you to Vegas, we can't double-date,\\
23 - and when's the last time\\
24 - you picked up a check, you mooch?\\
25 - I'm almost eleven.\\
26 - Okay, I think we've got it.\\
27 - I get him Thanksgiving, you get him Halloween.\\
28 - You get him Christmas eve, I get him Christmas day.\\
29 - I get him Yom Kippur.\\
30 - And I get Hanukkah.\\
31 - CHARLIE ( quietly ): Hey, guys,\\
32 - I just found out\\
33 - Jake's birthday is,\\
34 - like, in a week!\\
35 - Shouldn't we make plans?\\
36 - You're right, he's a schmuck.\\
37 - What? We know when his birthday is, Charlie.\\
38 - We were there.\\
39 - But only one of us got a needle\\
40 - shoved in their spine.\\
41 - You begged for that.\\
42 - Anyway, uh, you, me and Mom are taking Jake\\
43 - to a show at The Magic Castle.\\
44 - You invited Mom?\\
45 - You want to tell her she can't come\\
46 - to her only grandchild's birthday?\\
47 - 'Cause believe me, I tried.\\
48 - Oh, man.\\
49 - Look at the bright side.\\
50 - Maybe we can bribe one of the magicians\\
51 - to get her sawed in half.\\
52 - Or better still-- throw her in a wood-chipper.\\
53 - Oh, and, uh, uh,\\
54 - Judith and her sister are going to join us, as well.\\
55 - Which sister-- the brunette or the blonde?\\
56 - The brunette. Why?\\
57 - Just curious.\\
58 - I never slept with a blonde.\\
59 - Well, you're not going to sleep with the brunette again, either.\\
60 - Relax. That was 12 years ago.\\
61 - Thank you.\\
62 - Let's just wait till we get a look at her now.\\
63 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
64 - * Men... *\\
65 - Happy Birthday!\\
66 - A magic set?\\
67 - Awesome.\\
68 - EVELYN: Oh, how lovely.\\
69 - Perhaps he'll grow up to be a carnie.\\
70 - It includes 14 different illusions\\
71 - that will amaze and astound your friends.\\
72 - But of course,\\
73 - your friends may be smarter than mine.\\
74 - Cool.\\
75 - Have fun at the Magic Castle.\\
76 - Aren't you coming with us?\\
77 - Oh, I wish I could,\\
78 - but I got to go to some clown's wedding.\\
79 - I'll try and come back for cake, okay?\\
80 - Thanks a lot, Rose.\\
81 - Oh, you're welcome. Bye, Evelyn.\\
82 - Bye-bye.\\
83 - Thank you so much. Oh!\\
84 - Poor soul.\\
85 - I'm sure she meant well.\\
86 - Open Grandmommy's present.\\
87 - Clothes?\\
88 - Happy Birthday!\\
89 - Thanks a lot, but clothes?\\
90 - Not clothes, darling.\\
91 - It's Calvin Klein.\\
92 - No, it's clothes.\\
93 - Believe me, sweetheart,\\
94 - the girls are going to love you in this.\\
95 - What girls?\\
96 - All right, the other boys will be envious.\\
97 - The other boys will beat me up.\\
98 - Well, there's just no pleasing you, is there?\\
99 - Almost ready? Judith and Liz will be here soon.\\
100 - Liz. Thank you.\\
101 - Boy, that would have been embarrassing.\\
102 - Charlie, please don't make a bad situation worse.\\
103 - Judith and Liz have been\\
104 - at each other's throats for years.\\
105 - Why is that?\\
106 - I don't know.\\
107 - Maybe it was because Liz was always more popular,\\
108 - or maybe because Judith was smarter.\\
109 - Or maybe-- and this is just a-a theory on my part--\\
110 - it had something to do with the fact that\\
111 - Liz did my brother in the coat room\\
112 - at our wedding reception.\\
113 - Well, no secret why she was popular.\\
114 - At our wedding reception, Charlie.\\
115 - In the coat room.\\
116 - You were louder than the band.\\
117 - Boy, you make it sound so sleazy.\\
118 - I'm sorry.\\
119 - Class it up for me.\\
120 - Okay, to begin with,\\
121 - we were on a mink coat.\\
122 - Good-bye.\\
123 - And I was wearing a tuxedo.\\
124 - It's an eleven-year-old's\\
125 - birthday party.\\
126 - You could have at least put on a bra.\\
127 - Some of us don't need bras.\\
128 - Some of us have had husbands and children.\\
129 - Oh, I've had husbands.\\
130 - ( doorbell rings )\\
131 - And please, would you behave yourself with Charlie?\\
132 - What do you mean?\\
133 - I mean, I don't want a repeat\\
134 - of what happened in the coat room\\
135 - at my wedding reception.\\
136 - Oh.\\
137 - That was Charlie?\\
138 - Hey, soul sisters.\\
139 - Come on in.\\
140 - Alan, you look fantastic.\\
141 - I guess single life really agrees with you.\\
142 - Oh, well, you know, uh, doing okay.\\
143 - Starting over.\\
144 - Landed on my feet.\\
145 - Like a cat.\\
146 - Oh, hi, sweetie. Hi.\\
147 - Hey, Aunt Liz!\\
148 - There's my favorite nephew!\\
149 - Happy Birthday, sweetie.\\
150 - It isn't clothes, is it?\\
151 - Oh, this is a surprise.\\
152 - Hello, Evelyn.\\
153 - It's not a surprise. I told her.\\
154 - You're looking very well.\\
155 - Slimming down nicely.\\
156 - Thanks.\\
157 - I recently dropped 160 pounds.\\
158 - 152.\\
159 - I take Pilates.\\
160 - Hey, everybody.\\
161 - Hey, Uncle Charlie.\\
162 - Look what Aunt Liz got me.\\
163 - Awesome.\\
164 - I don't suppose you thought\\
165 - to buy him a safety helmet.\\
166 - Hey, you ride with Aunt Liz,\\
167 - you take your chances, right, Liz?\\
168 - This guy?\\
169 - Are you sure?\\
170 - Alan?\\
171 - Yeah, Mom.\\
172 - Now that we've seen the dove disappear\\
173 - up the greasy man's sleeve,\\
174 - how about we stop for a little drinkie-poo?\\
175 - Mom, it-it's still Jake's birthday.\\
176 - We're going home for cake.\\
177 - Okay.\\
178 - But first, a drinkie-poo!\\
179 - Don't you think you had enough to drink\\
180 - at the magic show, Evelyn?\\
181 - Excuse me, darling,\\
182 - but some of us deal with our boredom\\
183 - and depression the old-fashioned,\\
184 - non-prescription way.\\
185 - That's telling her, Evelyn.\\
186 - Oh, now, see?\\
187 - This one gets me.\\
188 - Alan, you married the wrong sister.\\
189 - Mom, why don't you lie down back there,\\
190 - take a little nap?\\
191 - Okeydokey.\\
192 - How can you not remember the coat room?\\
193 - I remember the coat room.\\
194 - I just don't remember you.\\
195 - How can you not remember me?\\
196 - Do you remember everyone you've had sex with?\\
197 - Of course not, but, come on.\\
198 - We're practically family.\\
199 - Okay, Dad, see this ring?\\
200 - Uh-huh.\\
201 - It's made of one unbroken piece of stainless steel.\\
202 - I-I I can see that.\\
203 - And this one is just the same, I swear.\\
204 - I-I believe you.\\
205 - Now watch.\\
206 - One, two, three.\\
207 - Hold on.\\
208 - One, two, three.\\
209 - Hmm, ironic.\\
210 - Wait, don't look.\\
211 - Alan, how are those magic fingers of yours?\\
212 - I'm sorry?\\
213 - I just have this kink in my back,\\
214 - and I was hoping you could give me one\\
215 - of your fantastic adjustments when we get home.\\
216 - Oh. Uh, uh...\\
217 - Sure, I suppose.\\
218 - Thank you.\\
219 - I can't wait.\\
220 - Wait a minute.\\
221 - His magic fingers you remember?\\
222 - Ta-da!\\
223 - This is really weird.\\
224 - Yeah. How could she not remember me?\\
225 - What are you talking about?\\
226 - What are you talking about?\\
227 - Judith's sister's hitting on me.\\
228 - She's not hitting on you.\\
229 - She's hitting on her sister's ex-husband.\\
230 - But that's me.\\
231 - Stop taking it personally.\\
232 - You said it yourself-- they've been going\\
233 - at each other for years.\\
234 - Now, let's examine\\
235 - the current situation.\\
236 - Nothing Liz does with me is going\\
237 - to make Judith any madder.\\
238 - I've already flown my mission.\\
239 - The only play she has left is to sleep with you.\\
240 - Oh. Oh, well, that's not going to happen.\\
241 - Well, certainly not with that attitude.\\
242 - Now, come on, you can't say you've never thought about it.\\
243 - Liz? No.\\
244 - Alan,\\
245 - look me in the eye.\\
246 - Okay, I'm-I'm looking.\\
247 - Tell me you've never thought about being with Liz.\\
248 - You know, you have very curly eyelashes.\\
249 - Answer the question.\\
250 - Oh, come on, Charlie.\\
251 - It's my ex-wife's sister.\\
252 - Exactly.\\
253 - Sisters are like the Holy Grail\\
254 - of recreational sex.\\
255 - Well, technically, it would be twins,\\
256 - but that's such a biological oddity,\\
257 - it's hardly worth pursuing.\\
258 - Hey, Dad, pick a card.\\
259 - Okay.\\
260 - Seven of diamonds.\\
261 - No.\\
262 - Eight of spades.\\
263 - No.\\
264 - Ace of clubs.\\
265 - No.\\
266 - Is it black or red?\\
267 - Mm.\\
268 - We'll just have the cake and then we'll go.\\
269 - You can go if you want.\\
270 - I'll have Alan drive me home after he adjusts me.\\
271 - Why are you doing this?\\
272 - Doing what?\\
273 - Alan.\\
274 - You want him back, don't you?\\
275 - No, I don't want him back.\\
276 - Then why do you care what I do with him?\\
277 - Look, if you're determined to do something stupid today,\\
278 - I'd actually prefer you do Charlie.\\
279 - So would Charlie,\\
280 - but we can't always get what we want.\\
281 - Wow, that's, uh, that's a lot of candles.\\
282 - He's still 11, right?\\
283 - You want to deal with the candles, Alan?\\
284 - Is that what you want?\\
285 - No, I'm fine.\\
286 - So, Alan, when do you think you'll be ready for me?\\
287 - Oh, uh, uh, maybe after the cake.\\
288 - Okay.\\
289 - You just say the word and we'll do it.\\
290 - In high school the word was "hello."\\
291 - Hmm?\\
292 - Oh, don't pretend you don't know what she's doing.\\
293 - Her back hurts, Judith.\\
294 - She wants an adjustment.\\
295 - Oh, she doesn't want an adjustment.\\
296 - And why do you think her back hurts in the first place?\\
297 - So, she does need an adjustment.\\
298 - Alan, I forbid you to have anything to do with my sister.\\
299 - Oh, really? You forbid me?\\
300 - Well, I've got news for you.\\
301 - We're not married anymore-- you don't get to forbid me.\\
302 - I'm warning you. Oh, what, what, warning now?\\
303 - What happened to forbidding?\\
304 - Okay, just listen to me.\\
305 - If you so much as lay one magic little finger on Liz,\\
306 - you and I are going to have a very big problem.\\
307 - What are you going to do, Judith, divorce me?\\
308 - Marry me again and then divorce me?\\
309 - Hey, want to see a trick?\\
310 - Oh, sure, sure.\\
311 - Yeah, sure, honey.\\
312 - "Good evening, sir or madame.\\
313 - Have we ever met before?"\\
314 - So, Liz, the wedding reception,\\
315 - the coatroom...\\
316 - Did I ever say thank you?\\
317 - I don't really remember, Charlie.\\
318 - Well, let me just say, long overdue then.\\
319 - Thank you.\\
320 - Okay.\\
321 - And not just for the one time.\\
322 - Over the years, I've actually used\\
323 - the mental picture of that night\\
324 - as lighter fluid when I'm...\\
325 - ( clears throat )\\
326 - ...you know, barbecuing alone.\\
327 - Oh come on, that's a compliment.\\
328 - Hey, Grandma.\\
329 - What?!\\
330 - Now, madame, keep your eye on the magic ball.\\
331 - Watch closely.\\
332 - No... wait.\\
333 - Okay, now I'll take the magic ball\\
334 - from my left hand and put it into my right.\\
335 - See?\\
336 - Now I'll throw the magic ball back into the cup.\\
337 - Whoosh!\\
338 - Do you think it's under the cup?\\
339 - Do I think what's under the cup?\\
340 - The magic ball.\\
341 - Very good, dear.\\
342 - * Happy birthday to you\\
343 - * Happy birthday to you\\
344 - * Happy birthday, dear Jake\\
345 - * Happy birthday to you.\\
346 - Good Lord, how long have I been asleep?\\
347 - Make a wish, buddy.\\
348 - ( all clapping )\\
349 - I've already made my wish.\\
350 - Don't you dare.\\
351 - Oh, now we're daring.\\
352 - Warning, forbidding and daring.\\
353 - I want to talk to you.\\
354 - Are you hearing this?\\
355 - I'm trying.\\
356 - What is your problem?\\
357 - You are my problem.\\
358 - Why are they fighting?\\
359 - Oh, they're not fighting, they're discussing.\\
360 - I'm a child of divorce, Dad.\\
361 - I know the difference.\\
362 - You're a selfish, hateful person.\\
363 - Maybe you should go to your room.\\
364 - It's my birthday.\\
365 - Ironic, huh?\\
366 - Hi, everybody.\\
367 - Sorry I'm late.\\
368 - Actually, Rose, you're right on time.\\
369 - Here's 50 bucks. Take Jake to the arcade\\
370 - and don't come back till you're out of quarters.\\
371 - Okay.\\
372 - Come on, Jake.\\
373 - Cool.\\
374 - So, how was the wedding?\\
375 - ( groans ): It was a circus.\\
376 - Bye, honey.\\
377 - Have fun.\\
378 - You were always a cheap slut and you haven't changed.\\
379 - Oh, I was the slut?\\
380 - Miss "Technically I'm still a virgin."\\
381 - Girls, girls.\\
382 - That's no way to talk.\\
383 - Ever since we were kids anytime I loved something,\\
384 - you had to take it away from me.\\
385 - But you will not take away my ex-husband.\\
386 - You love me?\\
387 - What? No, I'm trying to make a point here.\\
388 - Judith, if I wanted Alan,\\
389 - I could've had him a long time ago.\\
390 - What the hell does that mean?\\
391 - You never told her?\\
392 - Told me what?\\
393 - Oh, well, I mean, it's no big deal really.\\
394 - Um, it's just that, uh, before I asked you out, um,\\
395 - I asked, uh, uh, Liz out.\\
396 - ( gasps )\\
397 - You lied to me?\\
398 - If I had said yes,\\
399 - you never would've dated him.\\
400 - So, I was your second choice?\\
401 - No, no, no.\\
402 - Um, chronologically, yes,\\
403 - but in my heart, you were always first.\\
404 - But in reality, you were second.\\
405 - And you never told me this?\\
406 - Well, you can kinda see why.\\
407 - You know, this wouldn't have happened\\
408 - if you were twins.\\
409 - Okay, fine.\\
410 - You always wanted Liz, go ahead.\\
411 - Here's your chance.\\
412 - Give her your little adjustment.\\
413 - And maybe while you're having a good time with my sister,\\
414 - I'll have a good time with your brother.\\
415 - Beg pardon?\\
416 - Oh, don't be coy with me, Charlie.\\
417 - You know we've always had sexual tension between us.\\
418 - Really?\\
419 - I thought it was just regular tension.\\
420 - Oh, come on.\\
421 - I've seen you looking at my chest.\\
422 - You looked at my wife's chest?\\
423 - Hey, I'm a guy.\\
424 - I will rock his world, Alan, I swear.\\
425 - You're bluffing.\\
426 - Oh, am I? Watch me.\\
427 - Come on, Charlie.\\
428 - Come on. Alan!\\
429 - She's bluffing, Charlie.\\
430 - Are you sure?\\
431 - Trust me, she hates you.\\
432 - Trust me, that doesn't always stop 'em.\\
433 - Come on, Alan, I'll show you where it hurts.\\
434 - Um, uh, clear something up for me.\\
435 - Uh, "chiropractic adjustment,"\\
436 - that's just a euphemism, right? Right.\\
437 - So, we're really going to do this? Uh-huh.\\
438 - Wow, I thought we were bluffing.\\
439 - Okay, we were bluffing.\\
440 - Us, too.\\
441 - ( piano playing lively tune )\\
442 - ( playing lively tune )\\
443 - ( applause )\\
444 - ( applause, whooping )\\
445 - My God, that clown has no legs!\\
446 - Okay, you see the coin?\\
447 - You're supposed to say, "Have we ever met before?"\\
448 - Just watch the trick, okay?\\
449 - We'll work on the patter later.\\
450 - You see the coin?\\
451 - Mm-hmm.\\
452 - Now, I grab it with this hand\\
453 - and I blow... ( blows )\\
454 - and it's gone.\\
455 - Where do you think it is?\\
456 - It's right here.\\
457 - How the hell did you do that?\\
458 - Ironic, huh?
\subsection {Episode 20: Hey, I Can Pee Outside in the Dark}
1 - Hey, Judith.\\
2 - Oh, there's the rock star.\\
3 - Ready for a fun weekend?\\
4 - Leave me alone.\\
5 - Musicians.\\
6 - Alan, that child is driving me insane.\\
7 - Like father, like son, huh?\\
8 - Really, that bad?\\
9 - He's been sullen and uncooperative for days.\\
10 - I think he needs to see someone.\\
11 - What-what, you mean like a, like a shrink?\\
12 - No, Alan, I mean like a blacksmith.\\
13 - This is clearly a reaction to our divorce.\\
14 - He's not processing his emotions in a healthy way\\
15 - and I think therapy could help unblock him.\\
16 - Where did you get that?\\
17 - From my therapist.\\
18 - Who's working wonders with you.\\
19 - Excuse me?\\
20 - Who's working wonders with you.\\
21 - ( "Smoke on the Water" guitar riff plays )\\
22 - All he does is sit in his room\\
23 - and play that damn thing.\\
24 - He's isolating, Alan.\\
25 - That doesn't mean he needs a therapist.\\
26 - He's just a normal 11-year-old kid\\
27 - who happens to be a little grumpy.\\
28 - And I'm a normal 35-year-old mother\\
29 - who happens to be running out of patience.\\
30 - And by patience I mean Prozac.\\
31 - Wait a minute.\\
32 - You can't still be 35 because...\\
33 - Hey, he's getting pretty good at that.\\
34 - Yeah, well, get used to it.\\
35 - ( playing continues )\\
36 - ( playing continues )\\
37 - ( kissing in sync with guitar riffs )\\
38 - Charlie...\\
39 - what are you doing?\\
40 - "Smoke on the Water."\\
41 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men... *\\
42 - * Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh... *\\
43 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men *\\
44 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh *\\
45 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
46 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
47 - * Men. *\\
48 - ( "Smoke on the Water" guitar riff continues )\\
49 - Okay...\\
50 - it's not cute anymore.\\
51 - Make him stop.\\
52 - You're the one who bought him the guitar, Charlie.\\
53 - The bed is vibrating so much up there\\
54 - I'm no longer necessary.\\
55 - Well, I'm sorry my son's interrupting\\
56 - your afternoon debauchery,\\
57 - but I think he's upset about something.\\
58 - What's he upset about?\\
59 - I don't know.\\
60 - I was just giving him a little space\\
61 - before I talked to him.\\
62 - You want me to talk to him?\\
63 - Sure, and I'll finish for you upstairs.\\
64 - This is a father's job.\\
65 - Tell him I just need, like, 20 minutes.\\
66 - ( playing continues )\\
67 - Can I come in?\\
68 - Hey, it really sounds like you've got your mojo working.\\
69 - But-But let's, let's try to turn it down now, okay?\\
70 - What'd you do that for?\\
71 - Uh, because I love you\\
72 - and I don't want that to change.\\
73 - So, um, how was your week?\\
74 - Okay.\\
75 - Anything, uh, I need to know?\\
76 - Anything bothering you?\\
77 - No.\\
78 - You sure?\\
79 - 'Cause it seems like something's bothering you.\\
80 - Okay, you want to know what's bothering me?\\
81 - Yeah, yeah.\\
82 - People keep on asking me what's bothering me.\\
83 - Okay, I won't ask.\\
84 - Good.\\
85 - You know, when I was your age...\\
86 - Aw, man.\\
87 - Okay, forget that.\\
88 - Um, problems at school?\\
89 - No.\\
90 - Problems with Mom?\\
91 - No.\\
92 - Because I understand that there's some things\\
93 - a guy doesn't want to talk with his mom about.\\
94 - Like what?\\
95 - Well, you know, uh, girl problems, or, uh,\\
96 - somebody's picking on you, or, uh,\\
97 - you're the only guy in gym class\\
98 - without hair on his testicles.\\
99 - She sobered up on you, huh?\\
100 - No, I'm just being a good host...\\
101 - Yeah, a little bit.\\
102 - Man.\\
103 - You figure out what his problem is?\\
104 - No, but we determined mine was late onset puberty.\\
105 - You were a Mexican Hairless, weren't you?\\
106 - Did you check to see if he's constipated?\\
107 - Berta, his mother and I are going through a divorce\\
108 - and there's a lot of emotions he hasn't processed.\\
109 - Maybe so, but there's also a lot\\
110 - of string cheese he hasn't processed.\\
111 - You know, Judith thinks he needs\\
112 - to see a therapist.\\
113 - Why, 'cause it's working so good for her?\\
114 - Hey, Charlie, that's uncalled for.\\
115 - Come on, the kid's problem is he's 11.\\
116 - He can't drive, he can't drink,\\
117 - and his mother picks out all his clothes.\\
118 - Be thankful he's not in the garage\\
119 - biting the heads off of chickens.\\
120 - But this isn't like him.\\
121 - Trust your first instinct.\\
122 - Just give him a little space\\
123 - and probably by this time tomorrow...\\
124 - ( guitar riff plays )\\
125 - ...I will have killed him.\\
126 - ( playing continues )\\
127 - Not bad.\\
128 - But why don't you try fretting\\
129 - the E and the A string together?\\
130 - I like my way.\\
131 - Cool.\\
132 - Hey, what did you do that for?\\
133 - Look, I'm really happy you've taken up an instrument,\\
134 - and I'll be even happier when you learn an actual song.\\
135 - But right now, let's just take a little pause for the cause.\\
136 - What do you want?\\
137 - Nothing, I just thought\\
138 - we could hang out.\\
139 - Couple of musicians taking five.\\
140 - Just chillin'.\\
141 - Nothing's bothering me.\\
142 - That's cool.\\
143 - I'm not trying to harsh your mellow.\\
144 - It's just, I know that there are certain things\\
145 - a guy doesn't want to talk to his parents about.\\
146 - Like what?\\
147 - Oh, I don't know.\\
148 - Peer pressure. Bullies.\\
149 - Skipping class to drive to Tijuana\\
150 - with the school nurse.\\
151 - I'm telling you,\\
152 - my youngest once ate a whole can of Play-Doh.\\
153 - Stopped her up for two weeks.\\
154 - Berta, please.\\
155 - Finally pooped out an ashtray.\\
156 - Berta.\\
157 - That's the day I quit smoking.\\
158 - Any luck?\\
159 - The little snothead kicked me out of his room.\\
160 - Welcome to the club.\\
161 - Yeah, but I'm the cool uncle.\\
162 - Oh, and I'm the uncool dad?\\
163 - Don't get defensive.\\
164 - You did the best you could.\\
165 - Hey, hey, that kid has nothing to complain about.\\
166 - He's never been spanked,\\
167 - he's never even been yelled at,\\
168 - and even while my marriage was collapsing\\
169 - he always came first.\\
170 - Well, I'm glad you're not defensive.\\
171 - He has a great life.\\
172 - He gets everything he wants.\\
173 - I deny him nothing.\\
174 - Oh, my God, what have I done to my son?\\
175 - Alan, I was kidding.\\
176 - You're a terrific father.\\
177 - You think so?\\
178 - Yes, I do.\\
179 - You know what? You're right.\\
180 - I'm always too quick to blame myself.\\
181 - Yes, you are.\\
182 - It's his mother's fault.\\
183 - That-a-boy.\\
184 - Would you like me\\
185 - to make you a snack, Jake?\\
186 - I'm not hungry.\\
187 - You sure? We've got some pizza left from dinner.\\
188 - Alan, ease up.\\
189 - He said he's not hungry.\\
190 - You'll eat when you want to, right?\\
191 - Would you please not talk? I'm trying to watch.\\
192 - Shh.\\
193 - This show is stupid.\\
194 - You're right.\\
195 - Here, you pick something.\\
196 - Thanks.\\
197 - Cool uncle.\\
198 - Stupid. Stupid.\\
199 - Boring. Stupid.\\
200 - Seen it.\\
201 - Stupid. Stupid.\\
202 - Stupid.\\
203 - Really stupid.\\
204 - Stupid.\\
205 - Dumb. Stupid.\\
206 - All right.\\
207 - Pick a stupid show and live with it.\\
208 - Forget it. I'll just go to my room.\\
209 - Jake, wait.\\
210 - Nice going, cool uncle.\\
211 - Oh, now it's my fault?\\
212 - Let me tell you something.\\
213 - Between you and your wacko wife\\
214 - I'm an oasis of normality around here.\\
215 - Charlie?\\
216 - Are you ever going to come back upstairs?\\
217 - I'm still an oasis.\\
218 - ( plays guitar riff )\\
219 - Morning.\\
220 - Morning.\\
221 - Did your guest leave?\\
222 - No, she's sleeping in.\\
223 - Please do not let me forget again.\\
224 - Perhaps you should put a Post-It note on your penis.\\
225 - But then I'd have to take down the sign for the yard sale.\\
226 - Hey, buddy, I made silver dollar pancakes.\\
227 - I'm not hungry.\\
228 - They're your favorite.\\
229 - I said no.\\
230 - You know what I was thinking?\\
231 - Maybe later we could have a jam session.\\
232 - You on guitar, me on piano.\\
233 - I'd rather watch cartoons.\\
234 - Hey,\\
235 - what is your problem?\\
236 - Charlie, calm down.\\
237 - No, I'm sorry, but when I was his age\\
238 - I had to walk five blocks in the rain\\
239 - to have a jam session.\\
240 - Well, yelling at him isn't going to help.\\
241 - I was thinking that maybe the three of us\\
242 - could go out and do something fun today.\\
243 - You want fun?\\
244 - Let's take him to the Rose Bowl swap meet\\
245 - and see what we can get for him.\\
246 - ( knocking )\\
247 - Or we could be patient,\\
248 - and maybe he'll eventually tell us\\
249 - what's bothering him.\\
250 - Where's my grandson?\\
251 - Or we could scare it out of him.\\
252 - Granted, I don't know what it's like\\
253 - to be an 11-year-old boy,\\
254 - but I do know one thing, sweetheart.\\
255 - You have no idea what real unhappiness is.\\
256 - Real unhappiness is being totally ignored\\
257 - by the very people you gave birth to.\\
258 - Real unhappiness\\
259 - is when you're recovering from liposuction\\
260 - and your only grandson\\
261 - doesn't even send you a get-well card.\\
262 - And FYI, I only had that surgery\\
263 - so you wouldn't have a grandmommy\\
264 - with matronly upper arms.\\
265 - Well, if he didn't need a shrink before,\\
266 - he needs one now.\\
267 - I'm telling you, you're spoiling the kid.\\
268 - I didn't have a shrink when I was Jake's age,\\
269 - and my childhood was twice as screwed up as his.\\
270 - I mean, you're a little cuckoo, Judith...\\
271 - but compared to our mother,\\
272 - you're like a fart in a hurricane.\\
273 - Mom never took you to see Dr. Demerest?\\
274 - You got to see a shrink?\\
275 - Oh, just a couple of times.\\
276 - For the, uh, night terrors, agoraphobia and bed-wetting.\\
277 - Did it work?\\
278 - Hey, I can pee outside in the dark.\\
279 - You be the judge.\\
280 - You know, Charlie, if you think I'm cuckoo\\
281 - simply because I want to help my child express his feelings,\\
282 - well, then I think you have a big problem.\\
283 - ( whistling like a cuckoo )\\
284 - So, Jake...\\
285 - how you liking that beanbag chair, huh?\\
286 - Are you comfy?\\
287 - It's okay.\\
288 - 'Cause we could sit on the little chairs.\\
289 - You know, sometimes I like to sit in a little chairs.\\
290 - It makes me feel like a giant.\\
291 - ( imitating giant ): Hello, Jake.\\
292 - Well, I can barely see you from up here.\\
293 - ( chortling )\\
294 - Do you sometimes feel like a small, insignificant person\\
295 - in a world full of giants?\\
296 - Not really.\\
297 - Well, maybe it's just me.\\
298 - So, anyhow, I was hoping\\
299 - we could talk for a little bit,\\
300 - draw some pictures,\\
301 - maybe play some games.\\
302 - Do you like puppets?\\
303 - Not really.\\
304 - Neither do I.\\
305 - But sometimes they help when I'm in a bad "mooood."\\
306 - I hope she gets him to talk about the divorce.\\
307 - It's a traumatic thing\\
308 - to see his father kicked out of his house.\\
309 - It wasn't exactly healthy for him\\
310 - to see the life being sucked out of his mother.\\
311 - Excuse me, but that was going on for years,\\
312 - and he was still a happy little boy.\\
313 - "He stuck in his thumb and pulled out a..." blank.\\
314 - Plum, right?\\
315 - You know, Charlie, it'd be nice\\
316 - if you took a little responsibility\\
317 - for Jake's problems.\\
318 - She's right, Charlie.\\
319 - Me? What did I do?\\
320 - You taught him how to gamble.\\
321 - You brought strange women into the house.\\
322 - You taught him how to curse in Italian.\\
323 - Your drinking sets a bad example.\\
324 - Hey, hey, let's get one thing straight.\\
325 - I taught him how to curse in Spanish.\\
326 - Okay, well, Jake and I had a wonderful talk,\\
327 - and now I'd like to speak with the grown-ups.\\
328 - Aren't you coming in, Charlie?\\
329 - No, I'm still trying to find the toothbrush\\
330 - in the tree here.\\
331 - Oh, is this Uncle Charlie?\\
332 - Well, I definitely want\\
333 - to talk with Uncle Charlie.\\
334 - ( sotto voce ): Thanks a lot!\\
335 - Well, please, make yourselves comfortable.\\
336 - Okay. Well, Jake and I had\\
337 - a very nice little talk.\\
338 - I invited him to share his feelings with me\\
339 - in a confidential, non-threatening context,\\
340 - and after hearing everything he had to say,\\
341 - I must tell you very frankly...\\
342 - Ah, who am I kidding?\\
343 - I got nothin'.\\
344 - That's it? $150 an hour for "I got nothin'"?\\
345 - It's $175, but that's not really the point,\\
346 - now, is it?\\
347 - What did he tell you?\\
348 - Well, he claims nothing's bothering him,\\
349 - he claims there's nothing wrong,\\
350 - but when I probed just a little bit,\\
351 - he told me to "besa mi culo."\\
352 - See? Spanish.\\
353 - I hope you're proud of yourself, Charlie.\\
354 - Hey, he's not a sulky little jerkwad\\
355 - 'cause he learned a second language.\\
356 - See what my son's been living with?\\
357 - Only because she threw me out.\\
358 - What? I have a right to be happy.\\
359 - Speaking of which, did I leave that girl at the house?\\
360 - Oh, shut up, Charlie.\\
361 - Don't tell me to shut up.\\
362 - I don't even know what he's doing here.\\
363 - I'm trying to keep your kid\\
364 - from turning into a neurotic basket case like my brother.\\
365 - Maybe then he won't marry\\
366 - the first woman he meets\\
367 - who's more screwed up than he is.\\
368 - You were a lousy brother who left me to fend for myself...\\
369 - Hold on, people.\\
370 - Even cows know words can hurt.\\
371 - Jake, you know that even though\\
372 - your mother and I bicker sometimes,\\
373 - we will always love you no matter what.\\
374 - I know.\\
375 - And honey, you also need to know\\
376 - that our splitting up\\
377 - had absolutely nothing to do with you.\\
378 - I know.\\
379 - It's just that Mommy has a right to be happy.\\
380 - Yeah, yeah, he knows.\\
381 - And, uh, whatever's bothering you,\\
382 - you know I had nothing to do with it, right?\\
383 - Yeah.\\
384 - See?\\
385 - Can I go to bed now?\\
386 - Now? Jake, it's only 7:00.\\
387 - I'm tired.\\
388 - All right, honey.\\
389 - I'll come tuck you in before I leave.\\
390 - Okay, that's a bad sign.\\
391 - Yeah, it's a symptom of clinical depression.\\
392 - You would know.\\
393 - Please. If my kids had gone to bed at 7:00,\\
394 - I'd have dipped myself in gravy and danced naked on the rooftop.\\
395 - She does make a hell of a gravy.\\
396 - ( playing bluesy, jazzy riff )\\
397 - Morning, Uncle Charlie.\\
398 - Morning.\\
399 - ( playing stops )\\
400 - Morning, Dad, morning, Berta.\\
401 - Morning. Morning?\\
402 - So, Dad, what are we going to do today?\\
403 - I, uh, I don't know.\\
404 - Uh, what would you like to do?\\
405 - I don't know.\\
406 - Something fun.\\
407 - Maybe we could jam, Uncle Charlie.\\
408 - Great.\\
409 - Hey, Dad, can I eat my cereal down by the TV?\\
410 - Sure. Thanks.\\
411 - What happened to him?\\
412 - If I didn't know better,\\
413 - I'd swear he got laid last night.\\
414 - Well, I hope you don't mind but I talked to him\\
415 - before he went to sleep last night.\\
416 - What did you say?\\
417 - I said, uh, "Drink this bottle of prune juice."\\
418 - You feed him nothing but pizza and pancakes.\\
419 - It's a wonder his eyeballs are still in their sockets.\\
420 - ( playing "Smoke on the Water" riff )\\
421 - ( adds bluesy, jazzy riff )\\
422 - Wait a minute. Wait a minute.\\
423 - Oh, man, not again.\\
424 - Jake Harper... unplugged.
\subsection {Episode 21: No Sniffing, No Wowing}
1 - These divorce lawyers have a good business, don't they?\\
2 - Yeah, in the same way locusts have a good business.\\
3 - Mmm, smells good.\\
4 - So does the coffee.\\
5 - Charlie, stop sniffing the paralegals.\\
6 - Look, I am paying my attorney by the hour\\
7 - so just speak when spoken to,\\
8 - and, uh, otherwise, you know, just... shut up.\\
9 - Hey, if you'd listened to me in the first place,\\
10 - you wouldn't be in this mess.\\
11 - I'm the one who told you not to marry her.\\
12 - You're also the one who told me\\
13 - that if I jumped off the garage roof\\
14 - with a bath towel tied around my neck\\
15 - I could fly to school.\\
16 - The one time you listen to me.\\
17 - Let me tell you another thing.\\
18 - If I hadn't married Judith, there'd be no Jake.\\
19 - I didn't say you couldn't knock her up.\\
20 - Okay, let's get started.\\
21 - Wow.\\
22 - No. No wowing.\\
23 - No sniffing, no wowing.\\
24 - Laura Lang.\\
25 - Charlie Harper.\\
26 - Hey, didn't you used to date Superman?\\
27 - That's Lana Lang.\\
28 - She was Superboy's girlfriend,\\
29 - and guys have been using that tired old line on me\\
30 - since fifth grade.\\
31 - Did it ever work?\\
32 - Let's just get down to business, okay?\\
33 - Okay.\\
34 - Didn't the Titanic bang into her?\\
35 - Okay, Mr. Harper,\\
36 - the reason I wanted to see you\\
37 - is that your brother is involved\\
38 - in a divorce action\\
39 - where the custody of his son might become an issue.\\
40 - Really? Why?\\
41 - Well, because Jake stays with his father part-time.\\
42 - His father lives with you,\\
43 - and in the words of his mother,\\
44 - you are... hang on-- I want to get this right--\\
45 - oh, here it is...\\
46 - "a sleazeball."\\
47 - Yeah. So?\\
48 - So she might try to take Jake out of your home.\\
49 - Why? It's a beautiful home.\\
50 - You really should come see it some evening.\\
51 - It's in Malibu.\\
52 - Right on the beach.\\
53 - My point is, if Mrs. Harper decides\\
54 - to make an issue out of your lifestyle,\\
55 - we need to be prepared.\\
56 - What's wrong with my lifestyle?\\
57 - Oh, no. We are not going\\
58 - down that road at $300 an hour.\\
59 - Relax, Alan. I'm going to need to know\\
60 - every possible thing they can use against us--\\
61 - every skeleton in your closet.\\
62 - Oh, boy.\\
63 - So, what, you want to know about my sex life?\\
64 - Your sex life, your drinking, your gambling, partying.\\
65 - On the beach.\\
66 - Mr. Harper.\\
67 - I'm sorry.\\
68 - Isn't that kind of an invasion of my privacy?\\
69 - It is, and I apologize for that.\\
70 - But I handle a lot of divorces,\\
71 - and believe me, they can get nasty.\\
72 - Look, I've got to be in court,\\
73 - so why don't you give this some thought,\\
74 - and when you gather the information we need,\\
75 - give me a call.\\
76 - Okay. Starting from now and working backward,\\
77 - I've slept with... my brother's attorney...\\
78 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
79 - * Men... *\\
80 - So Laura, let me ask you something.\\
81 - The other day in your office,\\
82 - you didn't seem to like me much.\\
83 - I'm just wondering\\
84 - what caused you to drive over here,\\
85 - you know, mostly naked?\\
86 - Charlie, I don't have to like you to want you.\\
87 - Right on.\\
88 - For the record,\\
89 - I don't like you much either.\\
90 - Right on.\\
91 - Another question.\\
92 - Seeing as how you're my brother's lawyer and all,\\
93 - is what we're doing here-- what's the word-- unethical?\\
94 - Oh, God, yes.\\
95 - Right on.\\
96 - Listen, Charlie, I totally get who you are.\\
97 - You date lots of women. You're a player.\\
98 - That's fine. I don't care.\\
99 - Oh, you are very special.\\
100 - I just have one little request.\\
101 - You can pretty much have anything you want right now.\\
102 - If your brother found out about us,\\
103 - he could sue me for malpractice.\\
104 - I'm taking a big risk here.\\
105 - Man, this just keeps getting hotter.\\
106 - But I need you to do something for me.\\
107 - When I call you, when I want you,\\
108 - you've got to be there.\\
109 - Okay, let's practice.\\
110 - ( makes ringing sound )\\
111 - Hello?\\
112 - Oh, hey, Laura, what's up?\\
113 - Now.\\
114 - Right on.\\
115 - Hello? Charlie?\\
116 - Sorry, but I'm gonna have to speed this up.\\
117 - Charlie, relax.\\
118 - Just go downstairs and distract him.\\
119 - You're gonna leave?\\
120 - Hey, I'm done.\\
121 - No cuddling, no sharing feelings?\\
122 - I think I'm starting to like you.\\
123 - Save the sweet talk.\\
124 - Just remember our deal.\\
125 - It suddenly occurs to me.\\
126 - I'm usually the one sneaking out when the man gets home.\\
127 - Charlie, go!\\
128 - I thought it was a fun fact.\\
129 - Hey, Uncle Charlie.\\
130 - Hey, buddy. You're here early.\\
131 - Teacher's conference, half day.\\
132 - Whoa, where you going?\\
133 - I'm looking for my Gameboy.\\
134 - Forget your Gameboy.\\
135 - It's a beautiful day. Go watch TV.\\
136 - I don't want to watch TV.\\
137 - I want to play my Gameboy and it's in your room.\\
138 - Whoa, whoa, whoa!\\
139 - The parental code that unlocks the pay channels is 1234.\\
140 - 1234.\\
141 - I shoulda known.\\
142 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
143 - Did I interrupt your late morning nap\\
144 - or the early afternoon nap?\\
145 - I don't nap. I recharge.\\
146 - Can I get you a beer?\\
147 - Sure, thanks.\\
148 - Come on.\\
149 - Hang on. Alan Harper for Laura Lang, please.\\
150 - What are you doing?\\
151 - Calling my lawyer.\\
152 - Why? I thought we were gonna have a beer.\\
153 - Judith is demanding half my book collection.\\
154 - Oh, man. Sounds like you need a beer.\\
155 - They're rare first editions, Charlie.\\
156 - Very valuable.\\
157 - Okay, well, you don't need to get your lawyer involved.\\
158 - Hey, you've still got your old garage door clicker, right?\\
159 - Yeah.\\
160 - So, let Judith have the books\\
161 - and then one night maybe someone goes\\
162 - and gets them back.\\
163 - Wonderful. Breaking and entering.\\
164 - It's not "breaking" if you have the clicker.\\
165 - More good advice.\\
166 - And it's free.\\
167 - So hang up and let's get that beer.\\
168 - Sure, I'll hold.\\
169 - They're patching me through to her cell phone.\\
170 - ( phone rings )\\
171 - What's that?\\
172 - That?\\
173 - That is, coincidentally, my cell phone.\\
174 - Excuse me.\\
175 - Oh, hi, Alan.\\
176 - Don't answer!\\
177 - What's up?\\
178 - What are you doing?\\
179 - Hang on, Alan.\\
180 - I'm making a living, Charlie.\\
181 - I thought you were worried about malpractice.\\
182 - I'm more worried about billable hours.\\
183 - Can you prove you acquired the books\\
184 - in question prior to the marriage?\\
185 - Charlie!\\
186 - Coming.\\
187 - Shh.\\
188 - Why are you shushing me?\\
189 - Hang on.\\
190 - What?\\
191 - I'm on the phone with Laura.\\
192 - Say hi for me.\\
193 - Give it up, Charlie.\\
194 - She doesn't like you.\\
195 - True.\\
196 - Listen, you'll testify that I bought\\
197 - all my first-edition books before I got married, right?\\
198 - Did you?\\
199 - No.\\
200 - Then I'm your man.\\
201 - I can prove it.\\
202 - Charlie's my witness.\\
203 - Hey, what happened to the TV?\\
204 - There's nothing dirty on.\\
205 - I'm gonna get my Gameboy.\\
206 - No, no, no. No, no, no.\\
207 - No, wait right here.\\
208 - I'll get it for you.\\
209 - Of course, he's credible.\\
210 - I don't know, Alan.\\
211 - If the right lawyer gets their hands on him,\\
212 - they could really make him sweat.\\
213 - Very funny.\\
214 - Have you seen a Gameboy anywhere around here?\\
215 - Okay, we'll just have to do the best we can.\\
216 - I'll tell him exactly what to do\\
217 - and who knows?\\
218 - Maybe he'll get the job done.\\
219 - I got the job done twice.\\
220 - Why don't you let me talk to him?\\
221 - Charlie!\\
222 - Why?\\
223 - Where's my Gameboy?\\
224 - I'll buy you a new one.\\
225 - She wants to talk to you.\\
226 - Keep it short.\\
227 - Alan, if I could keep it short,\\
228 - my life would be so much simpler.\\
229 - Hello?\\
230 - Now.\\
231 - What?\\
232 - I want you now.\\
233 - You've got to be kidding.\\
234 - Charlie, I pay her by the hour.\\
235 - Just listen to her and do what she says.\\
236 - You're the boss.\\
237 - I'll get right on it.\\
238 - What did she say?\\
239 - Uh, she wants me to... write a statement.\\
240 - And she wants you to... take Jake out\\
241 - and buy him a new Gameboy.\\
242 - Why would she want that?\\
243 - For God's sake, Alan,\\
244 - you're paying this woman a lot of money.\\
245 - I suggest you take her advice.\\
246 - Jake, we're going out.\\
247 - I just want to make it clear\\
248 - that I would never behave in a way\\
249 - that would negatively influence my nephew.\\
250 - ( scoffs )\\
251 - Hey, what was that?\\
252 - Is she allowed to do that?\\
253 - Mr. Harper,\\
254 - how many women would you say\\
255 - you have sexual relations with in any given year?\\
256 - Excuse me.\\
257 - I do okay.\\
258 - Ten, 20, a hundred?\\
259 - Come on. I don't keep count.\\
260 - So we'll say... ten?\\
261 - I don't see the relevance of this.\\
262 - Well, we're trying\\
263 - to establish Mr. Harper's lifestyle\\
264 - as a way of determining whether his home\\
265 - is a suitable environment for a young boy.\\
266 - Okay, let me just say here that I love Jake\\
267 - and I make it my business to see that nothing goes on\\
268 - in front of him that is in any way inappropriate.\\
269 - You tell him, Charlie.\\
270 - And it's significantly north of ten.\\
271 - I think we can move on.\\
272 - Do you have any more questions?\\
273 - You are doing very well.\\
274 - Thanks.\\
275 - Uh... Mr. Harper, is it true that Jake saw\\
276 - a woman in the shower with you?\\
277 - Okay, yes.\\
278 - Now, in that instance, the door was closed,\\
279 - he didn't knock, and the door was closed...\\
280 - And...\\
281 - I'm sorry. What was the question?\\
282 - Woman in the shower.\\
283 - Don't help them.\\
284 - And, most important,\\
285 - he didn't see anything inappropriate.\\
286 - Well, then, what can you tell us\\
287 - about this picture that Jake drew?\\
288 - Okay, now...\\
289 - that's a totally different...\\
290 - Whoa! Man!\\
291 - Whoa-man. Woman.\\
292 - She was in my kitchen\\
293 - wearing a T-shirt, and she reached up for some...\\
294 - Uh-oh!\\
295 - SpaghettiOs.\\
296 - That... that's what she was reaching for.\\
297 - I'd like a moment to confer with my witness.\\
298 - You are making me so hot.\\
299 - I see.\\
300 - Look, Stuart,\\
301 - we both know you're on a fishing expedition here, right?\\
302 - Well... maybe.\\
303 - Maybe?\\
304 - You have no case.\\
305 - This man is a wonderful uncle.\\
306 - He provides a beautiful home.\\
307 - And the last time I looked,\\
308 - it wasn't against the law to be single\\
309 - in the United States of America.\\
310 - Oh, God...\\
311 - bless America.\\
312 - Amen.\\
313 - The good news is\\
314 - your wife has given up on the custody issue,\\
315 - All right. but we still need to finalize the property settlement.\\
316 - Now, aside from your books,\\
317 - she's requested a few other specific items.\\
318 - Like what?\\
319 - A massage chair.\\
320 - Oh, no. Oh, no. Forget it.\\
321 - Forget it.\\
322 - I love that chair.\\
323 - That was the only thing in my bedroom\\
324 - that moved when I touched it.\\
325 - Don't worry, Alan.\\
326 - I will get you your chair.\\
327 - I will get you your books.\\
328 - I will fight for you, I will win for you,\\
329 - and I won't stop until your wife is squished\\
330 - like a bug on a windshield.\\
331 - Okay, let's not lose sight of the fact\\
332 - that this bug is the mother of my child.\\
333 - So let's just keep the squishing to a minimum.\\
334 - CHARLIE: Don't worry.\\
335 - You don't need a bathing suit.\\
336 - Once you're drunk, the ocean's not cold at all.\\
337 - Charlie.\\
338 - Hey, Alan.\\
339 - And Laura.\\
340 - Hello, Laura.\\
341 - I didn't know you were here.\\
342 - Hi, Charlie.\\
343 - Crystal.\\
344 - Hey.\\
345 - Oh, yeah.\\
346 - I guess you guys know each other.\\
347 - ( clears throat )\\
348 - How's that flu?\\
349 - Oh, um, it's better.\\
350 - ( coughing )\\
351 - Hey, this calls for a drink.\\
352 - A very large drink.\\
353 - Um, I'm not getting billed for her time now, am I?\\
354 - Charlie.\\
355 - Okay, I know this is awkward,\\
356 - but let's keep in mind\\
357 - we agreed that you and I were just a casual deal.\\
358 - Two consenting adults, no strings, no drama.\\
359 - Charlie.\\
360 - And I'm willing to admit\\
361 - that trying to boink your assistant\\
362 - might not have been... Charlie.\\
363 - Yeah?\\
364 - Now.\\
365 - What?\\
366 - I want you now.\\
367 - But see, now's really not a good time.\\
368 - I mean, you're working with my brother,\\
369 - and Crystal took a sick day...\\
370 - Okay, that's a good point.\\
371 - Let me think this through.\\
372 - All right, there's just one way to make this work.\\
373 - I don't do threesomes, Charlie.\\
374 - Then I'm stumped.\\
375 - What's going on?\\
376 - Nothing. Not a thing.\\
377 - Charlie, there's no reason to lie.\\
378 - Are you sure?\\
379 - There usually is.\\
380 - I'm a little upset with your brother\\
381 - for getting involved with my assistant.\\
382 - It could be construed as a breach of ethics.\\
383 - Nice going, Charlie.\\
384 - This won't affect my case, will it?\\
385 - Of course not, Alan, I'm a professional.\\
386 - Listen, if we're going to make it\\
387 - to that settlement conference on time,\\
388 - maybe you should put on a jacket and tie.\\
389 - Nothing too nice.\\
390 - Oh, you're good.\\
391 - You think you can keep it in your pants\\
392 - till I get my stuff back?\\
393 - I'm trying harder than you think.\\
394 - Okay, we've got 15 minutes.\\
395 - Where do you want to do this?\\
396 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.\\
397 - It's not that I'm not into risky, semipublic sex,\\
398 - it's just that I'm starting to resent your attitude.\\
399 - Charlie, we have a deal.\\
400 - Okay, Laura, look, uh...\\
401 - I only went along with that because you're hot\\
402 - and took little to no effort on my part.\\
403 - Just make yourself at home, Crystal.\\
404 - That's the ocean.\\
405 - Anyway, uh, I think we might be done here.\\
406 - You're dumping me?\\
407 - Yep.\\
408 - Now.\\
409 - You're going to be very sorry, Charlie Harper.\\
410 - Yeah, girls have been using that tired old line on me\\
411 - since the fifth grade.\\
412 - Okay, the next item is the rare book collection\\
413 - appraised at $12,000.\\
414 - Actually, our appraisers came in at $16,500.\\
415 - Yeah.\\
416 - Enjoy them.\\
417 - What?\\
418 - I was only asking for half.\\
419 - Why break up a collection?\\
420 - Okay, what's next?\\
421 - Well, I understand there's a dispute\\
422 - over the massage chair.\\
423 - Not anymore. We concede.\\
424 - What do you mean we concede?\\
425 - We're not here for conceding.\\
426 - We're here for fighting and winning\\
427 - and squishing, remember?\\
428 - Alan, I know what I'm doing.\\
429 - Okay, moving on to the retirement fund.\\
430 - Take it. Take it?\\
431 - Take it. I'll take it.\\
432 - Are you out of your mind?!\\
433 - Okay, what else would you like?\\
434 - What else?!\\
435 - Judith, for God's sake,\\
436 - remember there was a time when you loved me.\\
437 - Oh, cool.\\
438 - Hey, that was quick.\\
439 - Yeah, like every other time Judith screwed me.\\
440 - What happened?\\
441 - What happened? I'll tell you what happened.\\
442 - My settlement conference turned into a drive-by colonoscopy.\\
443 - Ouch.\\
444 - Charlie, have you ever heard of a divorce agreement\\
445 - that requires the ex-husband\\
446 - to pay the ex-wife's dry cleaning for life?\\
447 - Wow.\\
448 - Yeah, not just clothes.\\
449 - Drapes, rugs, slipcovers...\\
450 - even suede.\\
451 - Sounds like she really took you to the cleaners, huh?\\
452 - Sorry.\\
453 - So, I... I fired Laura and tore up the agreement.\\
454 - I'm going to have to find a new attorney\\
455 - and just start all over.\\
456 - Oh, good then.\\
457 - No harm, no foul.\\
458 - Except for the thousands of dollars of extra legal fees.\\
459 - Oh, yeah, that's gonna sting a little, huh?\\
460 - Not as much as having to buy Judith's parents\\
461 - a retirement condo in Boca Raton.\\
462 - She didn't even ask for that.\\
463 - Laura just threw it in.\\
464 - Lawyers.\\
465 - But you know what the interesting thing is?\\
466 - No, what?\\
467 - After it was all over\\
468 - and Judith and her attorney went dancing out of the room,\\
469 - I asked Laura why she had done this to me,\\
470 - and she said, and I quote, "Ask your brother."\\
471 - So, here I am asking you--\\
472 - Why, Charlie?\\
473 - Why did my very expensive\\
474 - Beverly Hills divorce lawyer sell me out?\\
475 - ( sighs, clears throat )\\
476 - Okay, okay.\\
477 - I'll tell you the whole story.\\
478 - But maybe you should sit down first.\\
479 - * Men... *
\subsection {Episode 22: My Doctor Has a Cow Puppet}
1 - ( Alan imitating a vacuum )\\
2 - Alan?\\
3 - Alan, what are you doing?\\
4 - There are dust bunnies everywhere.\\
5 - Oh...\\
6 - so you're vacuuming dust bunnies?\\
7 - No, their poop.\\
8 - ( imitating vacuum )\\
9 - Are you sleepwalking?\\
10 - You're stepping in it, you're stepping in it!\\
11 - Don't step in it!\\
12 - ( imitating vacuum )\\
13 - Alan.\\
14 - Why don't we leave the dust bunny poop until morning?\\
15 - ( imitating vacuum )\\
16 - Click. Hey.\\
17 - Come on, come on.\\
18 - Let's get you tucked in,\\
19 - you crazy son of a bitch.\\
20 - Gort, klaatu barata nikto.\\
21 - What?\\
22 - You know.\\
23 - CHARLIE: Okay, that's it-- into bed.\\
24 - Nighty-night.\\
25 - And if you feel the need\\
26 - to get up and clean something again,\\
27 - maybe you can wax my car.\\
28 - Oh! For God's sake, Rose.\\
29 - Isn't there enough poop on the carpet tonight?\\
30 - What are you doing here?\\
31 - I'm sorry.\\
32 - I saw your lights come on, and I was worried.\\
33 - Why were you looking at my house at 3:00 in the morning?\\
34 - Haven't you heard of the Neighborhood Watch?\\
35 - We don't have a neighborhood watch.\\
36 - Well, not yet.\\
37 - If we did, I surely couldn't stroll in here\\
38 - like I just did.\\
39 - So, what's going on?\\
40 - Nothing. Alan was sleepwalking.\\
41 - At least I hope that was sleepwalking.\\
42 - Oh. Sure.\\
43 - My parents used to put a football helmet on me\\
44 - and strap me in bed.\\
45 - You were a sleepwalker?\\
46 - No.\\
47 - Good night, Rose.\\
48 - Good night, Charlie.\\
49 - Thank you; I had a wonderful time.\\
50 - If crazy ever becomes an Olympic event,\\
51 - I got the first two legs of the relay.\\
52 - Ah!\\
53 - What?\\
54 - Nothing.\\
55 - Man, I'm living in a loony bin.\\
56 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
57 - * Men... *\\
58 - Well, Judith, I don't care\\
59 - what all the other divorced parents are doing.\\
60 - I don't think Jake needs to keep seeing the psychologist.\\
61 - No, I am not in denial.\\
62 - Judith, denying you're in denial is not denial.\\
63 - Okay, okay... okay, look, this is how it's going to be.\\
64 - I will have Jake at the psychologist's office at 11:00.\\
65 - You're welcome.\\
66 - Damn it!\\
67 - What's wrong?\\
68 - Nothing.\\
69 - Were you talking to Mom?\\
70 - Yes, but I hung up before I said the bad stuff.\\
71 - Yeah, she does the same thing with you.\\
72 - Hey.\\
73 - Morning. Uh, why is the vacuum cleaner out?\\
74 - Because we were ankle deep in bunny poop.\\
75 - Were you drinking last night?\\
76 - Yes, but that's not the point.\\
77 - You were sleepwalking.\\
78 - Really? I have no memory of being up.\\
79 - Good for you,\\
80 - because I have no memory of being asleep.\\
81 - I'm sorry; I haven't done that\\
82 - since I was a kid.\\
83 - Yeah, well, if you're going to regress,\\
84 - let me know so I can stock up on rubber sheets.\\
85 - Okay, that was uncalled for.\\
86 - Hey, Jake, you want to go to the bowling alley\\
87 - and play some air hockey today?\\
88 - Sure, but you still owe me, like, $12,000 from last time.\\
89 - What are you going to do, break my thumbs?\\
90 - Wouldn't hurt your game.\\
91 - Just remember,\\
92 - we've got Jake's "session" first.\\
93 - Oh, man, I thought you didn't want him\\
94 - to go back to that quack.\\
95 - I didn't, but Judith and I talked,\\
96 - and we decided that what I want\\
97 - makes no difference whatsoever.\\
98 - Man, you are so whipped.\\
99 - I'm not whipped.\\
100 - I'm just trying to keep everybody happy.\\
101 - Meow. Fit-choo!\\
102 - I am not meow-fitchooed.\\
103 - You're right.\\
104 - It's been a long time since you got any meow.\\
105 - Are we getting a cat?\\
106 - You know, this is a waste of time.\\
107 - Jake's a normal kid.\\
108 - I know, but it's not going to hurt\\
109 - to have someone outside the family he can talk to.\\
110 - Oh, please.\\
111 - He's just sitting in there making stuff up.\\
112 - What?\\
113 - Well, not really making it up.\\
114 - He and I work out his schtick beforehand.\\
115 - Today he's telling her he sees dead people.\\
116 - Charlie, I am paying this woman a lot of money.\\
117 - Bet you feel pretty stupid, huh?\\
118 - What do you want me to do?\\
119 - Judith is insisting he comes here once a week.\\
120 - Okay, look, nobody likes divorce,\\
121 - but there are certain advantages.\\
122 - One of the more popular ones\\
123 - is you get to tell your ex-wife to bite the big one.\\
124 - Or whatever you got left.\\
125 - Oh, that'll help.\\
126 - Look, it's just an hour out of our day.\\
127 - Which could have been spent on air hockey\\
128 - and bowling alley martinis.\\
129 - It's a small price to pay to avoid aggravating Judith.\\
130 - Okay, I understand.\\
131 - Thank you.\\
132 - You're a big girl.\\
133 - Are there any out here?\\
134 - No.\\
135 - Good.\\
136 - We'll see you next Saturday.\\
137 - Doctor, you should know,\\
138 - he doesn't really see dead people.\\
139 - Oh, of course not.\\
140 - He's just trying to resolve emotional issues\\
141 - through visualized fantasy.\\
142 - Do you have my check?\\
143 - Hey, Dad, how come we never\\
144 - got spare ribs when we were at Mom's house?\\
145 - Because your mom thinks they're too fatty.\\
146 - Fit-choo!\\
147 - Is that really necessary?\\
148 - Hey, if the fit-choo fits...\\
149 - Fit-choo!\\
150 - Are you happy?\\
151 - Come on, he doesn't know what it means.\\
152 - Fine.\\
153 - Anybody see the pancakes\\
154 - for the moo-shu chicken?\\
155 - No, looks like they forgot them.\\
156 - Just eat it with a fork.\\
157 - You don't eat moo-shu with a fork.\\
158 - You eat moo-shu with a pancake like a little Chinese taco.\\
159 - Okay, all right.\\
160 - You want a taco shell?\\
161 - No, I don't want a taco shell.\\
162 - I want a pancake for my moo-shu.\\
163 - I ordered pancakes.\\
164 - I paid for pancakes.\\
165 - Where the hell are my pancakes?!\\
166 - Alan, chill.\\
167 - I will not chill.\\
168 - I want what I ordered.\\
169 - For once in my life,\\
170 - I will get what was promised me.\\
171 - Fit-choo!\\
172 - See? Not a clue.\\
173 - I am going to call that restaurant\\
174 - and give them a piece of my mind.\\
175 - That's smart-- scream at the people\\
176 - who handle your food.\\
177 - Is he okay?\\
178 - Oh, yeah; maybe a little tired.\\
179 - Just been working pretty hard.\\
180 - You know my second grade teacher, Miss Spulvaney?\\
181 - One time she got mad 'cause there was no chalk,\\
182 - and they found her in the cafeteria\\
183 - hiding under a lunch table.\\
184 - No kidding.\\
185 - Yup, she went berserk.\\
186 - That's how we got Miss McKinnon.\\
187 - Hi.\\
188 - Rose... how do you keep getting in the house?\\
189 - Oh, Charlie, aren't we past that?\\
190 - I just thought you'd like to know\\
191 - that your brother's sleepwalking again.\\
192 - And you had to get in bed with me to tell me that?\\
193 - No, silly.\\
194 - I was already in bed with you.\\
195 - I just heard him\\
196 - walking around downstairs.\\
197 - Alan?\\
198 - What are you doing?\\
199 - Making a birthday cake.\\
200 - You and Mom want some?\\
201 - You handle this, honey.\\
202 - I'm going back to bed.\\
203 - Jake, your grandmother's here.\\
204 - Oh, man.\\
205 - I mean right here in the room.\\
206 - Oh, man, grandma's here.\\
207 - I blame you.\\
208 - Take a number.\\
209 - Huh. How could we be out of eggs?\\
210 - Dr. Linda Freeman, child psychologist?\\
211 - Who here is seeing a child psychologist?\\
212 - Uh, Jake.\\
213 - His mom was concerned about, you know,\\
214 - the impact of the divorce and everything.\\
215 - On who?\\
216 - On Jake.\\
217 - I'll be right back.\\
218 - I'm gonna go get some eggs.\\
219 - Jake, honey,\\
220 - I-I just want you to know\\
221 - that seeing a therapist is no reflection on you.\\
222 - Okay. It's a reflection on your parents.\\
223 - Particularly your mother.\\
224 - I think I'm gonna get a cat.\\
225 - The Queen of Darkness is here.\\
226 - Thanks for the head's up.\\
227 - Where you going?\\
228 - Oh, we're out of eggs.\\
229 - And you have no idea why?\\
230 - Well, Charlie, I would assume somebody ate them.\\
231 - Okay, let's go with that.\\
232 - Then I tried Freudian analysis,\\
233 - but with them, you know, it's just sex, sex, sex.\\
234 - My doctor has a cow puppet.\\
235 - Really?\\
236 - MD or PhD?\\
237 - C-O-W.\\
238 - Hey, Mom, can I talk to you for a minute?\\
239 - Oh, be right there.\\
240 - Now, honey, the cow puppet doesn't need to know\\
241 - about the time you saw grandmommy\\
242 - dancing with the Cuban gentleman\\
243 - in the Neiman Marcus changing room.\\
244 - What is it, Charlie?\\
245 - I need to talk to you about Alan.\\
246 - He's been acting really strange lately.\\
247 - And I suppose it's my fault.\\
248 - No, no.\\
249 - Well, maybe.\\
250 - The thing is, he's been sleepwalking,\\
251 - and I remember him doing it when he was a kid.\\
252 - Oh, yes.\\
253 - It was shortly after your father passed away.\\
254 - What did you do about it?\\
255 - Well, nothing, really.\\
256 - It seemed to stop by itself when he was 13.\\
257 - Right around the time\\
258 - he started taking those long showers\\
259 - and, you know,\\
260 - relieving his anxiety in a more direct way.\\
261 - Got it.\\
262 - So, sexual release cured his sleepwalking.\\
263 - Seemed to.\\
264 - Of course there was a brief time when the two overlapped.\\
265 - I recall an incredibly awkward bridge game.\\
266 - Okay, great. Thank you.\\
267 - I had seven no trump, and he just walked in\\
268 - with this goofy smile on his face.\\
269 - This is nice.\\
270 - Great idea, Charlie.\\
271 - Well, I figure you work all week,\\
272 - you got your kid on the weekends.\\
273 - I bet you hardly even have the time\\
274 - to take a nice, long, soapy shower.\\
275 - Yeah, it has been a little hectic.\\
276 - Let me ask you something.\\
277 - When's the last time you had sex with a girl?\\
278 - Or a melon?\\
279 - Or anything?\\
280 - None of your business.\\
281 - That long, huh?\\
282 - Why do you care?\\
283 - I don't know.\\
284 - You just have that twitchy look\\
285 - of a guy who's got one stuck in the chamber.\\
286 - I am fine, Charlie.\\
287 - Yeah, sure, I'd like to meet somebody,\\
288 - but in the meantime I'm living a very full life.\\
289 - I have no complaints.\\
290 - Okay, this table is really starting to piss me off.\\
291 - Just let it wobble.\\
292 - You want beer in your lap,\\
293 - 'cause I don't want beer in my lap.\\
294 - Hi, Charlie.\\
295 - Who's your cute friend?\\
296 - Just get up here, you jackass.\\
297 - Hi, Charlie.\\
298 - Who's your cute friend?\\
299 - Oh, hi, Darlene.\\
300 - This is my brother Alan.\\
301 - Come, please, join us.\\
302 - Hi, Alan. This is my friend Annette. Hi.\\
303 - Hello.\\
304 - Hey, he is cute.\\
305 - You are.\\
306 - You know, Alan, Annette is a seat filler\\
307 - for most of the major awards shows.\\
308 - Is that so?\\
309 - Oh yeah, it's a big responsibility.\\
310 - 'Cause when a celebrity, like, gets up to go to the bathroom,\\
311 - they don't want to have an empty seat on TV.\\
312 - Understandable.\\
313 - You know who pees a lot?\\
314 - Jeff Bridges.\\
315 - Okay. Whataya say we get out of here\\
316 - and go back to our place?\\
317 - Okeydoke.\\
318 - Wait, wait, wait. Hold it.\\
319 - Everybody sit down.\\
320 - Wow, I feel like I'm at work.\\
321 - What is going on?\\
322 - Nothing.\\
323 - We met a couple of girls who took a shine to us.\\
324 - Just like that?\\
325 - Yes, Alan, just like that.\\
326 - Oh, God, please tell me you did not pay them.\\
327 - Hey, I resent that.\\
328 - Not all seat fillers hook.\\
329 - Well, it was very nice meeting you. I'm leaving.\\
330 - Be right back.\\
331 - Keep drinking.\\
332 - What is wrong with you?\\
333 - Me? There is nothing wrong with me.\\
334 - I'm just, I'm not interested in being set up\\
335 - with a woman whose idea of chitchat\\
336 - is celebrity pee-pee secrets.\\
337 - You want me to set you up with the other one?\\
338 - No!\\
339 - Are you sure, 'cause there's no way\\
340 - you're bagging her on your own.\\
341 - Why is this so important to you?\\
342 - Are you kidding me?\\
343 - You've been acting nuttier\\
344 - than rat crap in a pistachio factory.\\
345 - And I figured if I could coax your Johnson out of retirement,\\
346 - you'd stop making invisible birthday cakes.\\
347 - What?\\
348 - I can't say it more clearly than that, Alan.\\
349 - Are you happy?\\
350 - Are you? Are you happy?\\
351 - Anyway, I know you only deal with kids,\\
352 - but I didn't know where else to take him.\\
353 - This is ridiculous.\\
354 - I don't need to be here.\\
355 - I gave you a choice--\\
356 - Take the long shower or talk to the doctor.\\
357 - Well, if I had to guess--\\
358 - and that's pretty much all I do here--\\
359 - I would have to say\\
360 - that based on his inappropriate outbursts and sleepwalking,\\
361 - Alan is struggling with a great deal of suppressed rage.\\
362 - Rage? No, I don't... I don't think so.\\
363 - Oh, come on.\\
364 - Your wife threw you out of your own house,\\
365 - she still runs your life, you're broke,\\
366 - and you only get to see your kid two days a week,\\
367 - one of which you have to bring him\\
368 - to this rug rat exorcist.\\
369 - No offense.\\
370 - Okay.\\
371 - Now, Alan, how do you feel about what Charlie just shared?\\
372 - Well, I-I think he's completely off base.\\
373 - I mean, yes, I get a little frustrated sometimes.\\
374 - You know, when Judith doesn't get her own way\\
375 - she just keeps coming at me, and... and coming at me,\\
376 - like a friggin' steamroller,\\
377 - crushing my... my spirit, and my self-respect.\\
378 - That's very good.\\
379 - But on the other hand, she's a very good mom to Jake.\\
380 - Tell you what.\\
381 - Let's pretend\\
382 - that Judith is sitting in this chair.\\
383 - What would you tell her right now?\\
384 - I-I don't know.\\
385 - I feel a little silly talking to an empty chair.\\
386 - Fair enough. Charlie, do you mind?\\
387 - Do I mind what?\\
388 - Thank you.\\
389 - Now, Alan, tell Judith how you really feel.\\
390 - Well, um...\\
391 - Judith...\\
392 - I, uh, I know you're working through some of your own issues,\\
393 - sexual and otherwise, and, uh, and I support that.\\
394 - That's telling her, Alan.\\
395 - Charlie, remember you're Judith.\\
396 - Sorry.\\
397 - ( falsetto ): That's telling me, Alan.\\
398 - Is this going to take much longer?\\
399 - 'Cause I have to get to a massage,\\
400 - then a tennis lesson that he's paying for.\\
401 - Tennis?\\
402 - Since when do you play tennis?\\
403 - I told you, but you never listen.\\
404 - He never listens.\\
405 - Thank God his brother took him in.\\
406 - Hey, I am warning you.\\
407 - You're warning me?\\
408 - Okay, Alan, how are you feeling right now?\\
409 - Well... a little angry.\\
410 - Really, 'cause you don't sound angry.\\
411 - Well... I am.\\
412 - I just don't see any reason\\
413 - to make a-a big spectacle of myself.\\
414 - Yeah, you'd rather blow off a sure thing\\
415 - who actually makes a living with her ass.\\
416 - Meaningless, loveless sex is not the answer, Charlie.\\
417 - Meow, fit-choo!\\
418 - Okay, I am really getting tired of that.\\
419 - Hey, you know what, Charlie,\\
420 - I don't much care for that either.\\
421 - If you like, we can schedule another session\\
422 - to deal with your fear of vaginas.\\
423 - Now, Alan,\\
424 - the reason I asked you if you were angry\\
425 - is because I have yet to see any genuine expression\\
426 - of what are undoubtedly some very powerful feelings.\\
427 - Well, I-I'm sorry,\\
428 - but that's just the best I can do.\\
429 - Okay, well, let's try something else.\\
430 - This is called a bataka.\\
431 - It's heavily padded.\\
432 - It can't hurt anybody.\\
433 - But you can use it to vent your deep, angry feelings.\\
434 - You're wasting your time, Doc.\\
435 - He's too much of a wimp to...\\
436 - There you go.\\
437 - Good.\\
438 - Good.\\
439 - Keep going, Alan!\\
440 - Stop!\\
441 - Should I stop?\\
442 - Well, it's up to you.\\
443 - You paid for the full hour.\\
444 - Attaboy. Attaboy.\\
445 - Thank you, Doctor.\\
446 - That was great.\\
447 - I feel much better.\\
448 - Oh, good.\\
449 - Yeah, we're all thrilled for you.\\
450 - And by the way, about the... you know.\\
451 - I'm not scared of 'em.\\
452 - I just have a healthy respect.\\
453 - Fine.\\
454 - I'll see you both next week.\\
455 - How long am I gonna have to keep coming here?
\subsection {Episode 23: Just Like Buffalo}
1 - Jake, time to go.\\
2 - Get your stuff together.\\
3 - After you drop him off, you want to see a movie?\\
4 - Sure, that sounds good.\\
5 - Cool. Enjoy.\\
6 - Why don't you just tell me you've got a girl coming over?\\
7 - I didn't want to rub your nose in it.\\
8 - Thanks.\\
9 - She's gorgeous, by the way.\\
10 - Wonderful.\\
11 - Why are you putting Jake's stuff all over the house?\\
12 - Because I want this girl to see\\
13 - I'm not just another jerk trying to get her into bed.\\
14 - I'm a loving uncle.\\
15 - Who's trying to get her into bed.\\
16 - That's the loving part.\\
17 - Oh, this is the book I read to him at bedtime.\\
18 - You don't read to Jake.\\
19 - That's why you're going to the movies.\\
20 - Okay, ready to go.\\
21 - Is your skateboard still outside by the front door?\\
22 - Oh, sorry. I'll bring it in.\\
23 - No, no, leave it there.\\
24 - See, I do this thing where I kind of trip over it,\\
25 - then I bitch a little bit.\\
26 - You know, I'm harried, but lovable.\\
27 - You got everything? What about your schoolbooks?\\
28 - Oh, right.\\
29 - So, what time are you expecting Little Red Riding Hood?\\
30 - Oh, and I'm the Big Bad Wolf.\\
31 - Very clever, and not a bad game to play later.\\
32 - A little huffing and puffing and blowing...\\
33 - That's "The Three Little Pigs."\\
34 - Same wolf though, right?\\
35 - I got my schoolbooks.\\
36 - And your homework?\\
37 - Oh.\\
38 - You know, Charlie,\\
39 - if you took half the energy\\
40 - you put into manipulating casual sexual encounters\\
41 - and used it to actually build a relationship,\\
42 - you'd be a lot happier.\\
43 - Hard to imagine.\\
44 - Are you saying you never want to settle down?\\
45 - You mean get married?\\
46 - Let me tell you something, bunky.\\
47 - If you've got someone\\
48 - to clean your house and do your shopping,\\
49 - and you're getting some action on a regular basis,\\
50 - the only reason you need a wife\\
51 - is if you have some sick compulsion\\
52 - to give away half your stuff.\\
53 - What about kids?\\
54 - I already got one.\\
55 - And the best part is he leaves\\
56 - before we get sick of each other, right, dude?\\
57 - Okay, let's go.\\
58 - Bye, Uncle Charlie.\\
59 - See you next week.\\
60 - Where are your shoes?\\
61 - Oh, right.\\
62 - I've been so depressed since the divorce,\\
63 - I've gained eight pounds,\\
64 - and not one ounce went to my boobs.\\
65 - Honey, you're still better off without the rat bastard.\\
66 - But I miss the rat bastard.\\
67 - Listen to me, Kathleen.\\
68 - I thought I missed my husband too,\\
69 - but it turned out to be just a little prescription mix-up.\\
70 - Hi, Mom.\\
71 - There's my big boy.\\
72 - Don't I get a hug?\\
73 - Nope. Got to drain the lizard.\\
74 - Boys.\\
75 - Hey.\\
76 - Oh, hi, Alan.\\
77 - He left his homework in the car.\\
78 - Oh, thank you.\\
79 - Hang on. I have some bills you need to pay.\\
80 - Great.\\
81 - Hope they're really big ones.\\
82 - Hi. Alan.\\
83 - So, you, uh, you must be Judith's support group.\\
84 - It's funny 'cause, uh,\\
85 - I'm kind of supporting her, too.\\
86 - It's not funny ha-ha so much as...\\
87 - not funny.\\
88 - Ooh, cookies.\\
89 - Maybe this'll take the taste of foot out of my mouth.\\
90 - So, uh, who's the little baker among us?\\
91 - Mmm... foot.\\
92 - Can I have a cookie?\\
93 - Sure, sweetie.\\
94 - You are so cute.\\
95 - I know.\\
96 - You have a girlfriend yet?\\
97 - No, I'm a bachelor like my Uncle Charlie.\\
98 - So, you're never\\
99 - going to get married?\\
100 - No, as long as I got someone\\
101 - to clean my house,\\
102 - and some action on a regular basis,\\
103 - I don't need a wife.\\
104 - Excuse me?\\
105 - I don't want to give anybody half my stuff.\\
106 - Okay, bye-bye.\\
107 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
108 - * Men... *\\
109 - This is my favorite part of the house.\\
110 - I call it God's room.\\
111 - Are you religious?\\
112 - Oh, Tiffany, how can you not be when you look at...\\
113 - something like that?\\
114 - In fact, I'm always telling my...\\
115 - little nephew...\\
116 - what's important is this.\\
117 - Not the big house or the fancy car, or...\\
118 - all the expensive toys I'm always buying him.\\
119 - Wow, you're amazing.\\
120 - I don't know many guys\\
121 - that would make room in their lives\\
122 - for somebody else's child.\\
123 - Hey, he's family.\\
124 - What kind of a man doesn't make room in his life\\
125 - for his own family?\\
126 - ( door shuts )\\
127 - Oh, look, it's my brother Alan,\\
128 - who I also made room in my life for.\\
129 - Excuse me.\\
130 - Bro!\\
131 - All right, you moron...\\
132 - ...what part of "stay out of the house\\
133 - so I can run around naked with a hot chick"\\
134 - didn't you understand?\\
135 - I'm sorry.\\
136 - I'm just too depressed to sit through a movie.\\
137 - And you figured ruining my evening\\
138 - would cheer you up?\\
139 - ( phone ringing )\\
140 - You know, the movie was just a suggestion.\\
141 - Go bowling, Go sit on the curb. I don't care.\\
142 - Oh, leave me alone. Who's that?\\
143 - Judith, again.\\
144 - She's really upset with me.\\
145 - Oh, man, I'm sorry.\\
146 - Thank you. Now get out.\\
147 - Get out? She's upset with me because of you.\\
148 - Oh. Well, that's different.\\
149 - But still, get out.\\
150 - Your sexist, manipulative attitude towards women\\
151 - just got into Jake's head,\\
152 - and he spewed it out in front of his mother's\\
153 - angry women's support group.\\
154 - Wait a minute.\\
155 - Is it a women's support group that's angry,\\
156 - or a support group just for angry women?\\
157 - What difference does it make?\\
158 - Well, if they were already angry,\\
159 - then I'm less culpable.\\
160 - Okay,\\
161 - what did Jake say?\\
162 - Oh, not much; he just\\
163 - parroted your line\\
164 - about how women are only good for sex\\
165 - and cleaning the house.\\
166 - You didn't really say that?\\
167 - No, no, no, no.\\
168 - What I said was\\
169 - is that there's really no reason to get married\\
170 - if you've already got somebody to clean and...\\
171 - You want to go to the movies with me?\\
172 - Man, Jake's going to love this video game.\\
173 - Listen to this.\\
174 - 16 levels of ultra-realistic murder and mayhem.\\
175 - 24 flesh-ripping weapons, plus gratuitous nudity.\\
176 - Let me see that.\\
177 - "Scooter's Magic Tree Fort"?\\
178 - Scooter's a zombie.\\
179 - ( phone ringing )\\
180 - It's Tiffany.\\
181 - She's still talking to you after last weekend?\\
182 - What can I tell you?\\
183 - I'm hard to stay mad at.\\
184 - Hello? Oh, hey, Tiff.\\
185 - I've been thinking about you all week.\\
186 - Yeah, we did get off to a bad start,\\
187 - and I really blame myself.\\
188 - No, I'd love to try again.\\
189 - Um, I'm going to get Jake,\\
190 - but I'll leave the front door unlocked\\
191 - in case Satan shows up to collect your soul.\\
192 - Wait a minute, Alan.\\
193 - I got to put you on hold a sec, Tiff.\\
194 - How come Judith's not bringing him over?\\
195 - I don't know; Judith asked me to do it,\\
196 - and I just got tired of arguing.\\
197 - She still busting your chops about what Jake said?\\
198 - Look, blame it on me.\\
199 - Tell her I'm sorry.\\
200 - She won't buy it.\\
201 - Sure she will.\\
202 - Just keep shoveling it on till roses start growing in it.\\
203 - Poor Satan.\\
204 - He'll come for your soul and he'll leave empty-handed.\\
205 - Hey, Tiff, I'm back.\\
206 - Whoa.\\
207 - That's kind of harsh.\\
208 - Hey, wait a minute... Hello?\\
209 - Oh, I see.\\
210 - That's not the "hold" button.\\
211 - Hey. Is Jake ready?\\
212 - Not exactly.\\
213 - Maybe you should come in for a second.\\
214 - Judith, how many times have I asked you\\
215 - to have him ready when I...?\\
216 - Hello.\\
217 - Sit down, Alan.\\
218 - We want to talk to you.\\
219 - "We"?\\
220 - Yes. Sit down.\\
221 - Okay.\\
222 - I guess I can stay for a minute.\\
223 - Hmm. No cookies.\\
224 - No cookies.\\
225 - Um, Alan, Jake is not here.\\
226 - Why not? Where is he?\\
227 - He's sleeping over at a friend's.\\
228 - What are you talking about?\\
229 - This is my time with him.\\
230 - Yes, I know, but...\\
231 - Judith feels she can no longer\\
232 - allow her son to be exposed\\
233 - to the toxic influences of your brother.\\
234 - Whoa. Wait a second.\\
235 - We have a custody agreement.\\
236 - Yes, but Judith feels\\
237 - that the welfare of her son supersedes that.\\
238 - You can't do this. Yes, she can.\\
239 - Who are you? They're my friends.\\
240 - What the hell do your friends have to do with this?\\
241 - We love and support her.\\
242 - We won't let you bully her.\\
243 - Okay, first of all, can the person I talk to\\
244 - be the person who answers me?\\
245 - That's fair.\\
246 - Okay, I don't want to talk to you people.\\
247 - This is between me and Judith.\\
248 - You're absolutely right.\\
249 - Judith, tell him what we agreed.\\
250 - Okay. You can see Jake on weekends,\\
251 - but not at Charlie's house.\\
252 - But that's where I live.\\
253 - I'm sorry, Alan, but you'll just have to choose\\
254 - between your son and your brother.\\
255 - You know what?\\
256 - Maybe I have a problem\\
257 - with Jake being in this toxic environment.\\
258 - And I am not leaving\\
259 - until you bitter old crones are out of my house,\\
260 - and I have my kid back.\\
261 - All right, all right, you can stay,\\
262 - but I want my kid.\\
263 - Okay, I'll go.\\
264 - Morning.\\
265 - Hey.\\
266 - Where are the pancakes?\\
267 - What pancakes?\\
268 - You always make pancakes on Saturday morning.\\
269 - I make 'em for Jake.\\
270 - Jake's not here.\\
271 - Kind of weird without him, huh?\\
272 - Yes.\\
273 - Would it lift your spirits\\
274 - if you made pancakes for me?\\
275 - I'm sorry, man.\\
276 - I told you to blame it all on me.\\
277 - Charlie, they had moved way past blame.\\
278 - It was more like a jihad.\\
279 - Except with no cookies.\\
280 - Your big mistake was dealing with them as a group.\\
281 - The trick with women is to split 'em off\\
282 - from the herd one by one...\\
283 - otherwise they spook and you risk a stampede.\\
284 - Kind of like buffalo.\\
285 - In fact, I'll bet\\
286 - that's where that song comes from.\\
287 - * Buffalo gals, won't you come out tonight *\\
288 - * Come out tonight... Do you hear yourself?!\\
289 - "Buffalo gals"?\\
290 - Are you insane?!\\
291 - This is the kind of talk that started this whole mess!\\
292 - I didn't write the song, Alan.\\
293 - Morning.\\
294 - Morning, Berta.\\
295 - What, no pancakes?\\
296 - Jake's not here this weekend.\\
297 - Why not?\\
298 - Apparently, Jake took something I said out of context\\
299 - and repeated it in front of his mother,\\
300 - and she overreacted, as is her nature.\\
301 - What did you say, numb-nuts?\\
302 - Well, if your domestic chores are taken care of by one woman,\\
303 - and you have an active sexual life with other women,\\
304 - you don't necessarily need yet another woman\\
305 - with whom to tie the matrimonial knot.\\
306 - Oh. And which category do I come in under?\\
307 - Well, I got to say it's the sweet lovin', Berta,\\
308 - 'cause this place is a mess.\\
309 - ( knocking )\\
310 - Morning, everybody.\\
311 - I brought real maple syrup for the pancakes.\\
312 - There's no pancakes, Rose.\\
313 - Because Jake's not here.\\
314 - 'Cause Charlie's an idiot.\\
315 - Oh. Why?\\
316 - I mean,\\
317 - why is Jake not here,\\
318 - not why is Charlie an idiot.\\
319 - Because we know that.\\
320 - EVELYN: Hello?\\
321 - Where's my grandson?\\
322 - Oh, God, make this stop.\\
323 - Good morning.\\
324 - Hi, Mom. Good morning.\\
325 - So, where's Jake?\\
326 - Ask Charlie.\\
327 - Yeah, ask him.\\
328 - Well, Charlie?\\
329 - See? Just like buffalo.\\
330 - No, Evelyn, I'm sorry.\\
331 - I certainly want you to be able to spend time\\
332 - with your grandson, but I just don't want him around Charlie.\\
333 - Why? Why do you think?\\
334 - That's right.\\
335 - No, his attitude towards women is not a reflection\\
336 - on you or how you raised him.\\
337 - ( whispers ): Yes, it is.\\
338 - ( knocking )\\
339 - Look, there's someone at the door.\\
340 - I've got to go.\\
341 - No, Evelyn, I don't think this would seem less important\\
342 - if I was "getting a little."\\
343 - Judith, can't we talk about this?\\
344 - There's nothing to talk about, Charlie.\\
345 - Okay, don't talk. Just listen.\\
346 - I love Jake,\\
347 - and I would never intentionally do anything\\
348 - to influence him in a negative way.\\
349 - I don't care about your intentions.\\
350 - Okay.\\
351 - I'm a jerk, I'm immature,\\
352 - I'm self-centered, I'm...\\
353 - Hi, I'm Charlie.\\
354 - Yes, we've heard about you.\\
355 - And I'll bet none of it's good.\\
356 - I'm sorry. What is your name?\\
357 - Linda.\\
358 - Linda. Really?\\
359 - I once had my heart broken by a woman named Linda.\\
360 - Charlie, we're having a meeting.\\
361 - And I'll bet it was about me.\\
362 - Am I right?\\
363 - Come on. Be honest...\\
364 - Mandy.\\
365 - Mandy. I love that song, "Mandy."\\
366 - Charlie...\\
367 - Listen, I know I can't come in here\\
368 - and ask to be forgiven for some of the stupid things\\
369 - I've said in front of Jake...\\
370 - but I do have the right to say I'm sorry, don't I?\\
371 - I suppose.\\
372 - Thank you. And you are?\\
373 - Kathleen.\\
374 - Kathleen, a fine Irish name.\\
375 - Well, half Irish, on my mother's side.\\
376 - Are you and your mom close?\\
377 - I guess.\\
378 - I envy that, Kathleen.\\
379 - Me and my mom...\\
380 - Okay, Charlie, give it a rest.\\
381 - We're not a bunch of sorority girls\\
382 - you can charm with your big brown eyes.\\
383 - And nice smile.\\
384 - Thank you, Mandy.\\
385 - Linda, I admit\\
386 - I-I sometimes\\
387 - relate to women on a very superficial level,\\
388 - but I think that's because... deep down,\\
389 - I-I-I have intimacy issues that probably go back to my mom.\\
390 - My mother crippled me emotionally.\\
391 - You, too?\\
392 - And I am so afraid I'm making\\
393 - the same mistakes with my daughter.\\
394 - Well, you know what, uh...\\
395 - Ruth.\\
396 - Ruth.\\
397 - That's the same fear\\
398 - I have with Jake, Ruth.\\
399 - I've clearly made mistakes,\\
400 - but that's because I'm human,\\
401 - and after all...\\
402 - what are we trying to do with our children\\
403 - other than to raise them... as humans?\\
404 - Oh, stop it, Charlie.\\
405 - "Our children"? You have no children.\\
406 - That's true.\\
407 - Although I don't think it's fair to throw it in my face.\\
408 - I mean, some of us haven't been blessed\\
409 - with the little ones the way you have.\\
410 - That was uncalled for, Judith.\\
411 - Look, I'm being real up-front with you\\
412 - about the mistakes I've made with Jake,\\
413 - how I've influenced him...\\
414 - but let's talk for a minute about how he's influenced me,\\
415 - how this... little boy has made me... a better man.\\
416 - Oh, dear God, you're not going to listen to this crap,\\
417 - are you? WOMEN: Shh!\\
418 - No, I will not shh!\\
419 - He's lying to you.\\
420 - It's all he does: lie, lie, lie!\\
421 - You've got to believe me!\\
422 - It's okay. It's all right, Judith.\\
423 - We're all here for you.\\
424 - Okay.\\
425 - Who's ready for a refill?\\
426 - Oh, that kid.\\
427 - What are you going to do, huh?\\
428 - Charlie, where's the little girl's room?\\
429 - It's down the hall to the right,\\
430 - and around here we leave the seat up,\\
431 - so don't just drop trou and back in.\\
432 - Oh! You're terrible.\\
433 - I'm serious. I'm not coming in there with the shoehorn.\\
434 - You're getting a little pink there, Kathleen.\\
435 - Turn around. I'll put some more suntan lotion on your back.\\
436 - Okay.\\
437 - Hi, Alan.\\
438 - Hello.\\
439 - You have a lovely home.\\
440 - Thank you.\\
441 - Uh, what's happening?\\
442 - Oh, a bunch of us came over\\
443 - to have a little wine in God's room.\\
444 - Why don't you join us?\\
445 - Thank you.\\
446 - What the hell?\\
447 - CHARLIE & WOMEN: * Buffalo gals, won't you come out tonight *\\
448 - * Come out tonight, come out tonight *\\
449 - * Buffalo gals, won't you come out tonight *\\
450 - * And dance by the light of the moon. *\\
451 - ( knocking )\\
452 - Hey, Dad.\\
453 - Hey, pal.\\
454 - What's, uh, what's going on?\\
455 - I want my friends back.\\
456 - I'm sorry. What?\\
457 - Hi, Uncle Charlie.\\
458 - There he is! How you doing, buddy?\\
459 - We missed you around here.\\
460 - I slept over at Toby's house.\\
461 - Cool.\\
462 - Jake, honey, go put your stuff in your room.\\
463 - Okay.\\
464 - He's staying?\\
465 - Okay, here's the deal.\\
466 - We go back to the original custody arrangement,\\
467 - but with one new condition.\\
468 - What's that?\\
469 - Charlie agrees to never ever enter my house again.\\
470 - Done.\\
471 - Want some wine?\\
472 - Charlie...\\
473 - yeah, sure, why not?\\
474 - How?\\
475 - I told you, I'm hard to stay mad at.\\
476 - Anyway...\\
477 - they're your problem now.\\
478 - I'm going to hang with Jake till Tiffany gets here.\\
479 - What?\\
480 - You got a normal-sized head.\\
481 - Thanks. I'm pretty happy with it.\\
482 - Well, I don't get it.\\
483 - What don't you get?\\
484 - I heard Mom say the reason\\
485 - Uncle Charlie gets into so much trouble\\
486 - is because he thinks with his little head.\\
487 - It's not that little.\\
488 - Okay, you tell your mother...\\
489 - Charlie...\\
490 - ...that women are to be honored and respected.\\
491 - See, Jake?\\
492 - That's the big head talking.\\
493 - But he only has one head.\\
494 - Do you want to tell him,\\
495 - or should we let him spin for a while?\\
496 - I'd rather he spin.\\
497 - Oh, come on. At least give me a clue.\\
498 - All right.\\
499 - What do men have that women don't?\\
500 - Beards?\\
501 - Lower.\\
502 - ( lowering voice ): Beards.\\
503 - You're right. Let him spin.

1 - ( phone ringing )\\
2 - Hello.\\
3 - What?\\
4 - I can't understand you.\\
5 - Who is it?\\
6 - I don't know.\\
7 - Some woman crying.\\
8 - Hold on. Charlie!\\
9 - What?\\
10 - Phone for you.\\
11 - Who is it?\\
12 - An hysterical woman.\\
13 - Are you insane?\\
14 - I don't take calls from hysterical women.\\
15 - Here he is.\\
16 - You are very insensitive.\\
17 - Hello?\\
18 - Oh, hey, how are you?\\
19 - She's crying. Duh.\\
20 - Okay, calm down.\\
21 - I can't understand you.\\
22 - Omelette?\\
23 - What is omelette?\\
24 - Oh, "I'm late."\\
25 - What are you late for, hon?\\
26 - Get him out of here.\\
27 - Jake, go watch TV.\\
28 - What's the big deal?\\
29 - I don't cry when I'm late.\\
30 - Okay, are you sure?\\
31 - Don't yell.\\
32 - How did this hap...?\\
33 - Scratch that.\\
34 - Okay, okay, just stay calm.\\
35 - I'm here for you.\\
36 - We'll deal with this together.\\
37 - You didn't happen to catch her name, did you?\\
38 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
39 - * Men... *\\
40 - The instructions sound pretty clear.\\
41 - You pee on the stick...\\
42 - and if it turns blue, it means you're pregnant.\\
43 - The stick turns blue.\\
44 - Yes, sweetheart, first go into the bathroom.\\
45 - Not exactly a rocket scientist.\\
46 - As opposed to the Nobel Prize winners\\
47 - you usually bring home?\\
48 - Uh-huh, I'm still here.\\
49 - Go ahead. Let 'er rip.\\
50 - What do you mean, you can't?\\
51 - Hold on.\\
52 - How's that?\\
53 - Yeah, I'm a genius.\\
54 - Now we wait 30 seconds.\\
55 - Please, God, please, please, please.\\
56 - Isn't it a little late for prayer, Charlie?\\
57 - Don't mock my faith.\\
58 - Yeah, I'm here.\\
59 - Did it change colors?\\
60 - No? Well, t-that, that's good, right?\\
61 - Well, sure, in a strange way\\
62 - I'm a little disappointed, too.\\
63 - Hold on a sec.\\
64 - So, what else is new?\\
65 - Congratulations. When's the wedding?\\
66 - Isn't that nice?\\
67 - Best of luck.\\
68 - Bye-bye.\\
69 - Boy, don't you just hate when that happens?\\
70 - So, so, this\\
71 - is a common occurrence?\\
72 - Don't you take precautions?\\
73 - Well, of course.\\
74 - But come on-- you've never found yourself\\
75 - in a slow elevator without a condom?\\
76 - Look who I'm asking.\\
77 - We need soap,\\
78 - uh, razor blades, cotton balls...\\
79 - Cotton balls-- that reminds me.\\
80 - Reminds you of what?\\
81 - Ribbed for her pleasure.\\
82 - Ultra thin for mine.\\
83 - Fiesta colors for... I suppose fiestas.\\
84 - And extra-strength, double latex\\
85 - for Coyote Tuesdays.\\
86 - Boy, if women knew the trouble we go to.\\
87 - Why don't you just get snipped?\\
88 - You mean a vasectomy? Yeah.\\
89 - Well, then say vasectomy.\\
90 - Don't say "snipped."\\
91 - What's wrong with snipped?\\
92 - It's demeaning.\\
93 - Snipped is what you get for 12 bucks at Supercuts.\\
94 - Fine. Why don't you get a vasectomy?\\
95 - I've considered it.\\
96 - In fact, a couple of years ago,\\
97 - I believe there was a petition circulating.\\
98 - So, what's holding you back?\\
99 - I don't know, it's kind of a permanent move.\\
100 - What happens if one day I finally meet the right woman\\
101 - and decide I want to raise a family?\\
102 - ( baby crying )\\
103 - Don't cry. Look.\\
104 - Ooh, ooh, ooh!\\
105 - Look at Daddy's funny face.\\
106 - Ah, who am I kidding?\\
107 - Sweetheart, I have to go.\\
108 - I have a patient.\\
109 - No, you just stay off your feet.\\
110 - Remember, you're very, very pregnant.\\
111 - I love you, too.\\
112 - I know.\\
113 - I know, we're going to have a baby.\\
114 - Yes, we are.\\
115 - ( chuckling ): Okay, sweetie, bye-bye.\\
116 - So, Mr. Harper, you want a vasectomy.\\
117 - Um... yes.\\
118 - You do that, right?\\
119 - Of course we do, in the exam room next door.\\
120 - Snip, snip.\\
121 - Great. Uh, I just have a couple of... pre-snip questions.\\
122 - Shoot. Which, by the way, you'll still do post-snip,\\
123 - if that was one of your questions.\\
124 - Well, good.\\
125 - Of course, if I've done my job right,\\
126 - you'll be shooting blanks. Yeah.\\
127 - Yeah, I got that.\\
128 - What I was wondering\\
129 - is if there's any permanent effects.\\
130 - You mean like sexual impairment?\\
131 - No, no, no... wait a minute.\\
132 - There can be sexual impairment?\\
133 - No. I just wanted to see the look on your face.\\
134 - Actually, you'll be able to perform\\
135 - exactly as you did before.\\
136 - Well, great.\\
137 - But what about, like, uh, creativity?\\
138 - See, I write music for a living.\\
139 - Will I still be able to do that?\\
140 - Do you write with your testicles?\\
141 - No.\\
142 - Then it shouldn't be a problem.\\
143 - Now, let me ask you a question.\\
144 - Do you have children already?\\
145 - No. Okay, then you might\\
146 - want to think about freezing some sperm\\
147 - in case you ever change your mind.\\
148 - Frozen sperm-- I don't know.\\
149 - Why not?\\
150 - Well, you know,\\
151 - you freeze shrimp, it's never as good as fresh.\\
152 - That's really not the same thing.\\
153 - So, you know for a fact that frozen kids\\
154 - are just the same as the regulars?\\
155 - Yeah, pretty much.\\
156 - Of course, when they grow up,\\
157 - they do tend to migrate to the Sunbelt.\\
158 - Nothing. Wow.\\
159 - That one kills at urology conventions.\\
160 - ( phone ringing ) Excuse me.\\
161 - Yes? Oh, put her on.\\
162 - ( sotto voce ): It's my wife.\\
163 - Hi, honey.\\
164 - Oh, no kidding.\\
165 - She's really kicking up a storm, huh?\\
166 - We know it's a girl.\\
167 - Good. Oh, hang on.\\
168 - Um, do you like Brittany or Allison for a name?\\
169 - They're both nice.\\
170 - Yeah.\\
171 - Okay, honey, let me get this guy out of here\\
172 - and I'll call you back.\\
173 - Okay, Mommy.\\
174 - ( chuckling )\\
175 - Yeah, you're going to be a mommy.\\
176 - Yes, you are.\\
177 - So, frozen sperm.\\
178 - I'm just not really sure\\
179 - I want to go into some little room\\
180 - with a bunch of magazines and, you know...\\
181 - Actually,\\
182 - we have videos now.\\
183 - Kind of hot.\\
184 - But you don't have to do it here.\\
185 - We'll give you a container, and you can go home\\
186 - and make yourself comfortable, dim the lights,\\
187 - put on a little sweet soul music...\\
188 - I know the procedure.\\
189 - Then just bring it back here\\
190 - while the little fellas are still swimming,\\
191 - and we'll turn 'em into popsicles.\\
192 - "Popsicles"?\\
193 - You know, in case someday you want to be a pop.\\
194 - Oh, yeah.\\
195 - ( chuckles weakly ): Very clever.\\
196 - Well, you deal with prostates and penises all day,\\
197 - you better have a sense of humor.\\
198 - And warm hands.\\
199 - Oh, that's good. I'll use that.\\
200 - "Warm hands."\\
201 - That's good.\\
202 - I'm done. Can I go play in my room?\\
203 - Jake, Grandma came all the way over here\\
204 - to spend some time with you.\\
205 - Alan, don't use guilt as a control mechanism.\\
206 - He should only spend time\\
207 - with me if he wants to.\\
208 - So, I can go, right?\\
209 - Run.\\
210 - Morning.\\
211 - Good morning, darling.\\
212 - Morning, Charlie.\\
213 - Oh, Charlie, what's wrong with your pee-pee?\\
214 - What?!\\
215 - A little birdie told me\\
216 - you were in a urologist's office yesterday.\\
217 - Thanks a lot, Tweety.\\
218 - I didn't say anything.\\
219 - Coincidentally,\\
220 - your doctor has a suite\\
221 - in the same medical building as Dr. Shankman,\\
222 - the man responsible\\
223 - for one out of three tight tushies in Beverly Hills.\\
224 - So, Dr. Shankman saw me and told you?\\
225 - No, you left your appointment card on the table here.\\
226 - I just brought up Dr. Shankman\\
227 - because no one has noticed my new tushy.\\
228 - Very nice, Mom.\\
229 - Of course. It's a Shankman.\\
230 - So, Charles, back to your pee-pee.\\
231 - I'm done. Can I go play in my room?\\
232 - There's nothing's wrong with it.\\
233 - I'm just getting a vasectomy.\\
234 - You must really hate me.\\
235 - Um... are we changing the subject?\\
236 - How can you have a vasectomy without consulting me?\\
237 - You're selfishly robbing me of grandchildren.\\
238 - You've got grandchildren.\\
239 - Oh, big whoop-- one.\\
240 - Well, if it makes you feel any better,\\
241 - I'm going to do the freezing thing.\\
242 - Really? Well, I suppose that's better than nothing.\\
243 - You know, I'm doing a freezing thing, too.\\
244 - What? Excuse me?\\
245 - At death I plan to have my head removed and frozen\\
246 - until such time as it can be revived\\
247 - and put on a monkey body.\\
248 - What? Everybody's doing it.\\
249 - ( sultry music playing )\\
250 - Charlie, you got somebody in there?\\
251 - CHARLIE: Uh, no.\\
252 - I need to get your towels.\\
253 - Uh, I really wish you wouldn't.\\
254 - Come on. I'm doing laundry.\\
255 - I want to finish a load before I go.\\
256 - Yeah, well, me, too.\\
257 - What?\\
258 - Never mind. Just go away.\\
259 - All right.\\
260 - If it helps, you can think of me.\\
261 - Oh, hey, Charlie, wait a second.\\
262 - I don't pick up Jake till after dinner.\\
263 - You want to catch an early movie?\\
264 - Maybe. But I got to make one stop first.\\
265 - Come on.\\
266 - What's in the bag?\\
267 - Sperm.\\
268 - No, really.\\
269 - Sperm.\\
270 - Whose sperm?\\
271 - Seabiscuit's. Who do you think? Mine.\\
272 - I thought we were going to a movie.\\
273 - Yeah, but first I'm having my sperm frozen\\
274 - and getting a vasectomy.\\
275 - Ah.\\
276 - I could've met you at the theater, you know.\\
277 - Just hold the bag.\\
278 - There is another container inside this bag, right?\\
279 - Of course.\\
280 - You just got to keep it out of the sunlight.\\
281 - Why?\\
282 - Is it vampire sperm?\\
283 - ( siren blaring )\\
284 - Aw, geez, he's going to want to look in the bag.\\
285 - Oh, God, oh, God.\\
286 - What the hell did you do that for?!\\
287 - I don't know. I panicked!\\
288 - Hey, hey, Charlie?!\\
289 - What?\\
290 - Are you nuts? You can't put that in the freezer.\\
291 - It's ice cream.\\
292 - Store-bought, not hand-cranked.\\
293 - Yeah, you're hilarious.\\
294 - You're lucky I'm still talking to you\\
295 - after tossing my swimmers on the Coast Highway.\\
296 - What?\\
297 - It's nothing.\\
298 - Thanks to you, I got to reschedule the whole deal\\
299 - for this afternoon. What whole deal?\\
300 - It's not important, Jake.\\
301 - Why shouldn't he know?\\
302 - Okay, go ahead. Explain it to him.\\
303 - Well, Jake...\\
304 - Your Uncle Charlie is getting a vasectomy.\\
305 - Oh.\\
306 - What's wrong with the car you have now?\\
307 - Well done.\\
308 - All right, let me try again.\\
309 - Uh, a vasectomy\\
310 - is a very simple operation...\\
311 - Are you sick?\\
312 - No, no, no, I'm-I'm perfectly healthy.\\
313 - It's a procedure so that I don't have, uh, babies by accident.\\
314 - Oh, yeah, like we had to do with Scout.\\
315 - Scout?\\
316 - A dog we had.\\
317 - Couldn't keep it in his fur.\\
318 - Keep going. You're doing great.\\
319 - Uh, Jake, it's not exactly the same with people as with dogs.\\
320 - I know.\\
321 - Why don't you just use a condom?\\
322 - I guess he knows more than he lets on.\\
323 - You do, don't you?\\
324 - I hear things.\\
325 - Thanks for baby-sitting, Rose.\\
326 - Oh, my pleasure.\\
327 - Is Charlie going to be okay?\\
328 - Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, he's just having\\
329 - a-a little procedure done and I need to be there\\
330 - to drive him home. Oh, what kind of procedure?\\
331 - Uh, it's personal.\\
332 - Oh, I understand.\\
333 - Mm. Where is he?\\
334 - Upstairs, uh... getting ready.\\
335 - Throwing a few things in a bag.\\
336 - I'll, uh... I'll tell Jake you're here.\\
337 - Okay.\\
338 - ( sultry soul music playing )\\
339 - Charlie?\\
340 - CHARLIE: Rose, for God's sake!\\
341 - ROSE: Do you need a hand?\\
342 - CHARLIE: No! Get out!\\
343 - Charlie?\\
344 - CHARLIE: What?!\\
345 - What's the little cup for?\\
346 - CHARLIE: Go away, Rose.\\
347 - Don't be embarrassed.\\
348 - That's a perfectly natural way to relieve stress.\\
349 - You know what I do? Jumping jacks.\\
350 - CHARLIE: Rose, please.\\
351 - The only downside is when I exercise,\\
352 - I get all hot and sweaty,\\
353 - and my clothes start clinging to my body,\\
354 - so then I have to go and take a nice, hot, soapy shower.\\
355 - CHARLIE: Then what?\\
356 - Rose?\\
357 - Oh, damn.\\
358 - Look, I'm sorry I walked in on you.\\
359 - I thought you were finished with the video and everything.\\
360 - Forget it, Alan.\\
361 - I wish I could.\\
362 - Why didn't you hang a sock on the doorknob?\\
363 - I would if I had one.\\
364 - Obviously, a power much greater than myself\\
365 - doesn't want me to freeze my sperm.\\
366 - Yeah, but if you don't,\\
367 - and you go ahead with this vasectomy,\\
368 - you'll never be able to have children.\\
369 - Well, what difference does it make?\\
370 - We both know I'm not daddy material.\\
371 - Well, no, not now... or anytime soon,\\
372 - but who knows, maybe in the distant monkey-body future.\\
373 - Look, this is my life.\\
374 - I know what's best for me.\\
375 - Okay, Mister... Harper,\\
376 - why don't you jump up on the table,\\
377 - put your legs in the stirrups, and we'll get you shaved.\\
378 - Oh, damn.\\
379 - I didn't bring the camcorder.\\
380 - Thanks, Alan.\\
381 - I'll see you later. Good luck.\\
382 - Oh, uh, uh, don't forget to put a cone\\
383 - around his head so he doesn't bite at the stitches.\\
384 - All right.\\
385 - Let's have a look.\\
386 - Okay, in my defense, it's a little cold in here.\\
387 - Boy, if I had a nickel for every time I heard that.\\
388 - So...\\
389 - what's your name?\\
390 - Naomi.\\
391 - Let me ask you something, Naomi.\\
392 - Does doing this make you want\\
393 - to have dinner with me more or less?\\
394 - Just a reminder, Mr. Harper:\\
395 - I'm holding a razor to your genitals.\\
396 - I know, but how "meet cute" is this?\\
397 - What a great story\\
398 - to tell our...\\
399 - Our what?\\
400 - Never mind.\\
401 - Okay, all done.\\
402 - That was quick.\\
403 - You got a little mirror so I can check out the back?\\
404 - Not that little.\\
405 - Come on, honey, all right?\\
406 - Breathe with me. Breathe with me.\\
407 - Ah, ooh, ooh. All right, that's good. That's good.\\
408 - Now listen, I just got to do one quick snip,\\
409 - and then I'll meet you at the hospital.\\
410 - Excuse me, quick snip?\\
411 - Oh, no, thanks, I'm fine.\\
412 - I love you. Breathe, honey, just breathe.\\
413 - Okay, bye-bye.\\
414 - Whoa, it's getting exciting now.\\
415 - Okay, let's see what we're up against here.\\
416 - Woof! That's quite a haircut.\\
417 - Looks like my grandma in a bathing cap.\\
418 - Okay, Mr. Harper,\\
419 - I'm going to give you a local anesthetic here,\\
420 - so you're going to feel a little sting.\\
421 - Okay, just let me know\\
422 - when you're about to... holy mother of God!\\
423 - Okay, here it comes.\\
424 - Kidding.\\
425 - Kidding.\\
426 - Now we'll just give it a minute till we're nice and numb.\\
427 - You know, we're thinking Juliet now, or maybe Julianne.\\
428 - Both good names.\\
429 - Yeah. You want a name that fits a child\\
430 - but also is appropriate for an adult.\\
431 - Can you feel my finger?\\
432 - What finger? Why, why?\\
433 - What are you doing?\\
434 - Okay, let's start snipping.\\
435 - ( phone rings )\\
436 - Naomi, could you get that for me?\\
437 - Hello?\\
438 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
439 - No, no, I can talk.\\
440 - What? You-you're kidding. Already?\\
441 - Okay, um, don't panic. I'm on my way.\\
442 - Okay, this is a little embarrassing,\\
443 - but I have to go.\\
444 - Naomi, why don't you see to it\\
445 - that Mr. Harper has another appointment\\
446 - and, uh, no charge for the haircut.\\
447 - I'm going to be a daddy!\\
448 - Man, he looks really happy.\\
449 - Yeah, well, they've been trying for a long time.\\
450 - Uh, you can put your legs down now.\\
451 - Yeah... that's one option.\\
452 - Unbelievable. Let it go, Alan.\\
453 - Who goes in for a vasectomy and comes out with a date?\\
454 - What? I'm a man; she's a woman.\\
455 - A woman who, two minutes after you met her,\\
456 - was shaving your scrotum.\\
457 - So we skipped ahead a little.\\
458 - Hey, you feeling any calmer, Uncle Charlie?\\
459 - What do you mean?\\
460 - When Scout had his operation, he got real calm.\\
461 - Then he got fat and only wanted to sleep behind the dryer.\\
462 - Okay, first of all, it's not the same operation,\\
463 - and second of all, I didn't even have it.\\
464 - So you're going to have kids?\\
465 - I don't know. Maybe someday.\\
466 - I hope so 'cause you'd be a cool dad.\\
467 - Really?\\
468 - Mm-hmm.\\
469 - Did you hear that?\\
470 - Yeah.\\
471 - So, you're, uh, you're not\\
472 - going to have the vasectomy?\\
473 - Hey, I tried my best,\\
474 - but it just wasn't meant to be.\\
475 - What do you mean?\\
476 - Do you think it was a coincidence\\
477 - that my urologist was having a baby\\
478 - at the very moment I was about to get snipped?\\
479 - I mean, I'm not\\
480 - a particularly religious guy,\\
481 - but clearly a power much greater than myself\\
482 - wants me to knock somebody up someday.\\
483 - You called?

1 - The snap, the kick is up, and it is good! It is good!\\
2 - - Man. - Okay, well, that's the game.\\
3 - Dad, can I have my allowance?\\
4 - Sure. Here.\\
5 - Thanks. Here.\\
6 - Pleasure doing business with you.\\
7 - You're taking my son's allowance on a football bet?\\
8 - Hey, when he wins, I pay off. You know, minus the vig.\\
9 - Minus the vig. You're charging him for the privilege of making a bet?\\
10 - That's what the vig is, Dad.\\
11 - Face it. He's not gonna learn this stuff in school.\\
12 - I don't care. Give him his allowance back.\\
13 - Fine.\\
14 - You get no allowance. That's your punishment for gambling.\\
15 - - Told you he'd do that. - Yeah, you did.\\
16 - Pleasure doing business with you.\\
17 - Hey, listen. After you drop him off at his mom's house tonight, do me a favor?\\
18 - - Just make yourself scarce, okay? - What's her name?\\
19 - Or is it too early to ask?\\
20 - It's not a girl. I'm just having friends over.\\
21 - Oh, poker? Oh, can I play?\\
22 - - I'm better than I used to be. - It's not poker.\\
23 - Wait. A flush beats a straight...\\
24 - ...and a full boat beats a flush, right? - Right...\\
25 - A full house and a full boat are the same...\\
26 - ...so I won't say "full houseboat" anymore.\\
27 - - It's not poker, Alan. - Then what's going on?\\
28 - I'm just having some friends over to smoke cigars...\\
29 - ...sample some fine single-malt Scotch and, you know, talk.\\
30 - I enjoy all those things. Well, Scotch makes me a little gassy.\\
31 - But I'll take a Beano and I'm good to go.\\
32 - That's nice, but I don't think you'd be comfortable.\\
33 - - Why not? - Because we talk about personal things.\\
34 - - You mean like a support group? - No, no, no. It's not a support group.\\
35 - It's just guys who get together to talk about their lives.\\
36 - - That's a support group. - No, it's not.\\
37 - Okay, it's not.\\
38 - It's not.\\
39 - Got it. So why can't I come?\\
40 - Because these men are my friends.\\
41 - There's a level of trust and confidentiality.\\
42 - - I'm your friend. - No, you're my brother.\\
43 - Wait a minute. You don't consider me a friend?\\
44 - It's not up to me.\\
45 - A friend is someone you choose. A brother is someone you get.\\
46 - - Excuse me? - There's no choice involved.\\
47 - Your dad just wakes you up in the night and says:\\
48 - "Your mom wasn't really fat and this isn't your room anymore."\\
49 - So all these years, I've just been an intruder to you?\\
50 - An inconvenience? A burden?\\
51 - Well, sure. You can spin it that way.\\
52 - You know, I had no idea you felt this way.\\
53 - I am very, very hurt.\\
54 - Okay.\\
55 - But you'll still make yourself scarce, right?\\
56 - - Bye, Uncle Charlie. - See you, buddy.\\
57 - - Oh, he's your buddy? - Alan, don't start.\\
58 - How is he your buddy? You didn't choose him.\\
59 - - I chose to let him stay here. - You chose to let me stay here too.\\
60 - No. I chose him, I got you.\\
61 - You know, there are times I just loathe you.\\
62 - And yet you're surprised I don't consider you a friend.\\
63 - Okay, have your real friends to your little "support group."\\
64 - - It is not... - It is a support group!\\
65 - It's a support group for weak, rudderless men.\\
66 - And I wouldn't be a part of it if you begged me.\\
67 - Okay, bye.\\
68 - Dad, check this out. You can pick your friends...\\
69 - ...you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's nose.\\
70 - - You know who told me that? - I can guess.\\
71 - Uncle Charlie. And you know why it's funny? Because it's true.\\
72 - Yeah, yeah. Have a nice week, Jake.\\
73 - Bye, Dad. Hi, Mom. Can I have my allowance?\\
74 - I missed you too, sweetie.\\
75 - - Thanks for dropping him by. - Judith, hold on.\\
76 - Do you consider us friends?\\
77 - I consider you my ex-husband.\\
78 - I know. But putting aside for the moment...\\
79 - ...our loveless marriage and messy divorce...\\
80 - ...we always had a certain camaraderie, am I right?\\
81 - Can we talk some other time? I'm having people over for dinner.\\
82 - Oh, really? Anybody I know?\\
83 - - Sandra and Howard. - Oh, no kidding. Can I say hello?\\
84 - - I'd rather you didn't. - Why not?\\
85 - Sandra and Howard are my friends too. In fact, I introduced them to you.\\
86 - Well, why don't you call them and invite them to your house.\\
87 - This is my house. Those were my friends.\\
88 - The fact is, you're having my friends for dinner in my house.\\
89 - Yes, Alan, that is exactly what's happening.\\
90 - Well, when I'm right, I'm right.\\
91 - I've got something I wanna talk about, but it's gotta stay in this room.\\
92 - Everything stays in the room.\\
93 - Yeah, sure, Judas. Does that include veiled references...\\
94 - ...in one of your wise-ass songs?\\
95 - - I said sorry about that. - Too little, too late.\\
96 - We have to go through this every time we get together?\\
97 - - It's water under the bridge. - Thank you.\\
98 - It wouldn't have killed you to thank him in your Grammy speech.\\
99 - That I would've done, but, you know, Bacharach, he just went on so long.\\
100 - Well, get on with it.\\
101 - All right. How do I say this?\\
102 - Do any of you get up in the middle of the night to pee?\\
103 - - Sure. - Occasionally.\\
104 - Sometimes, I don't even get up.\\
105 - This is what I can't write songs about?\\
106 - Oh, drat.\\
107 - All right, look. It's not about peeing, per se.\\
108 - It's about getting older.\\
109 - I'm laying in bed with my wife.\\
110 - She looks beautiful, sexy.\\
111 - All I wanna do is finish my Corn Pops and go to sleep.\\
112 - What are you doing?\\
113 - Shopping list. You know, just a shopping list.\\
114 - So you're saying the old flag's at half-mast?\\
115 - No, the old flag is fine.\\
116 - And I'd rather not refer to it as an old flag, if you don't mind.\\
117 - No, my point is, it's about shifting priorities or something.\\
118 - Flag, drag, hag.\\
119 - I will knock your glasses through your eyeballs. I will do it.\\
120 - Let me tell you something, fellas.\\
121 - It doesn't matter what the calendar says, you're as old as you feel.\\
122 - Me, I feel...\\
123 - ...like...\\
124 - ...boiled crap.\\
125 - - Hello. - Oh, man.\\
126 - I'm sorry, guys. It's my brother.\\
127 - We agreed you weren't gonna be here.\\
128 - Don't worry, I just need my phone book.\\
129 - - Is that...? - Yes.\\
130 - - And that...? - Yeah.\\
131 - And that?\\
132 - He used to be. Not anymore.\\
133 - Him I don't recognize.\\
134 - He's our bookie.\\
135 - You can have your bookie, but not me?\\
136 - Bookies, like friends, are chosen.\\
137 - Okay. Okay, fine. I'm sorry to interrupt.\\
138 - I need my address book so I can call one of my friends.\\
139 - They don't care. Hurry up and get out.\\
140 - Hurry up and get out. Sounds like sex with my ex-wife.\\
141 - I don't know if Charlie told you, but I'm recently divorced...\\
142 - ...and it's been kind of a rough road.\\
143 - - Here's your phone book. - Thank you.\\
144 - Of course, I guess in hindsight, I should have seen it coming, but...\\
145 - - I'm gonna count to three. - Bye.\\
146 - Sorry about that. He's bent out of shape because I told him...\\
147 - ...he couldn't be part of the group. - Why not?\\
148 - You just saw him, didn't you? Trust me, he doesn't get any better.\\
149 - I mean, he actually thinks this is a support group.\\
150 - This is a support group, Charlie.\\
151 - You're the only one who's pretending it's about Scotch and cigars.\\
152 - Whatever kind of group it is, we have rules about new guys joining.\\
153 - Well, but he's your brother.\\
154 - He's obviously going through a rough time.\\
155 - Seems like you should be more supportive, pal.\\
156 - Hey, I support him plenty.\\
157 - I share my home with him. I share my food with him.\\
158 - I moved my foosball table so he could park in my garage.\\
159 - What more do you people want from me?\\
160 - Let me tell you something about sharing, kid.\\
161 - Sharing is a two-way street.\\
162 - When you share with another human being...\\
163 - ...you always get back more than you gave.\\
164 - Assuming that you're smart enough to share with somebody...\\
165 - ...that's got more stuff than you had in the beginning.\\
166 - Hey, Dick, it's Alan. How's it going, buddy?\\
167 - Oh, good, good.\\
168 - Listen. You maybe wanna catch a movie tonight?\\
169 - Oh, really? You and Roz are at Judith's too. Interesting.\\
170 - So in addition to my house, half my money, and my self-esteem...\\
171 - ...Judith got custody of all my friends.\\
172 - No, no, no, I don't wanna take it up with her. I...\\
173 - Hi, Judith.\\
174 - No, no. I'm not trying to ruin your party.\\
175 - In fact, I've got a little party of my own.\\
176 - Alan, come back to bed. I'm cold.\\
177 - Be right there, baby.\\
178 - I gotta go, Judith. Bye.\\
179 - Well, that's a new personal low.\\
180 - You know, as long as we're talking about getting older...\\
181 - ...I was at this club the other night, window-shopping.\\
182 - I realize I'm the oldest guy in the bar.\\
183 - I mean, I still look good.\\
184 - But I'm competing for women with guys who are way younger.\\
185 - I gotta tell you, I felt kind of depressed, like maybe my best days are behind me.\\
186 - Oh, you're breaking my heart.\\
187 - There's maybe 11 women in this city who haven't saluted his old flag.\\
188 - We should talk about Charlie and his brother.\\
189 - What? Why?\\
190 - We've been meeting all these years and I never even knew you had a brother.\\
191 - I didn't see that it was relevant.\\
192 - Let me tell you something about relevant.\\
193 - The root of the word relevant is "rel"...\\
194 - ...which is also the root of the word "relative."\\
195 - Your brother is your relative, ergo, your brother is relevant.\\
196 - What?\\
197 - Another "rel" word is "relapse."\\
198 - But I'll wait my turn.\\
199 - Hi. Is this Doug Ziskin?\\
200 - Yeah, yeah. Hey, Doug, it's Alan Harper.\\
201 - I'm your chiropractor. But I'm calling as a friend.\\
202 - Well, I'd like to think we are.\\
203 - Forget it. Sorry I woke you.\\
204 - Hey, neighbor. What are you doing out here all by your Ionesome?\\
205 - Charlie's got some friends over and I thought I'd give him some space.\\
206 - Oh, yeah. His support group.\\
207 - He claims it's not a support group.\\
208 - Oh, please. He also claims he's not in love with me.\\
209 - What do you want, Rose?\\
210 - Nothing. I was just sitting over there in Charlie's car...\\
211 - ...and thought you might like some company.\\
212 - From the minute they brought him from the hospital...\\
213 - ...everything was about the baby.\\
214 - "Don't wake the baby. Don't tease the baby. Don't paint the baby."\\
215 - Then when he starts growing up, it gets worse.\\
216 - Everything he does, I get blamed for.\\
217 - He wakes up one morning with no hair and one eyebrow, it's my fault.\\
218 - They find him tied to a street lamp...\\
219 - ...and big surprise, everybody's looking at me.\\
220 - Charlie, you need to stop resenting your brother just for being born.\\
221 - Hey, I don't resent him for being born...\\
222 - ...but he abused the privilege.\\
223 - Even now, with you guys.\\
224 - I jumped through hoops to get into this group.\\
225 - I had to be recommended, then I had to get to know you guys.\\
226 - Now Alan thinks he can waltz right in because he's my little brother?\\
227 - It's not fair.\\
228 - Let me tell you something about fair.\\
229 - What?\\
230 - Charlie, you know in your heart the right thing to do.\\
231 - Fine. You want him so bad, I'll get him.\\
232 - You know, Sean never speaks about his siblings.\\
233 - All right, back off, Mary Poppins.\\
234 - You're working on my last nerve.\\
235 - Believe me, Alan, I understand how hurtful it is to be rejected by Charlie.\\
236 - And I found that the only way to get through it is to just love him more.\\
237 - That, and every so often, sneak into his bedroom and try on his underwear.\\
238 - Helpful tip.\\
239 - Hello.\\
240 - - Oh, hello, Charlie. - Yeah, listen. I've been thinking.\\
241 - Why don't you take a Beano and come back to the house and join the group.\\
242 - Oh, really? What changed your mind?\\
243 - I had a small stroke. What difference does it make? Get your ass back here.\\
244 - Well, did it occur to you that I might be already otherwise engaged?\\
245 - - No. - Well, I am.\\
246 - It would be inconvenient for me to return right now.\\
247 - Why? Where are you?\\
248 - Where am I? Well, that's none of your business.\\
249 - Are you in the garage?\\
250 - Oh, please. What on earth would I be doing in the garage?\\
251 - Cut it out, Rose.\\
252 - You're being silly, Alan. Charlie is reaching out to you.\\
253 - Yeah, right. Last time he reached out...\\
254 - ...I wound up tied to a street lamp on Wilshire Boulevard.\\
255 - All right. Are you gonna come back inside...\\
256 - ...or do I have to drag you in by your big, flappy monkey ears?\\
257 - Listen to him, Alan. He's begging.\\
258 - No, thank you, Charlie. I am quite happy chatting out here with Rose.\\
259 - Okay. I tried to be the loving brother, you sulky little weasel.\\
260 - That really wasn't necessary, Alan.\\
261 - Yes, it was. You're my friend.\\
262 - And friends don't just abandon friends because something better comes along.\\
263 - Then this might sting a bit.\\
264 - I have something else to do and I'm pretty sure it's better.\\
265 - All right, I asked him nicely. He said no. Let's move on.\\
266 - Coop, what's up with your fixation on women who resemble Tobey Maguire?\\
267 - I think I finally got over that one. I went to see Spider-Man 2. Nothing.\\
268 - Hi, everybody. Thanks for the invite.\\
269 - I know I'm the new guy.\\
270 - So I'll hang back and try not to disrupt the flow.\\
271 - So is there any protocols I need to know about?\\
272 - Any customs, traditions, a talking stick?\\
273 - No, there's no talking stick.\\
274 - But there is a "shut the hell up" shoe.\\
275 - Okey-doke. As you were.\\
276 - All right, I've got something I wanna share.\\
277 - The panic attacks have come back, and I just don't understand it.\\
278 - Everything is great. My career, my marriage.\\
279 - I should be on cloud nine and instead of which...\\
280 - ...I've got this free-floating anxiety and feeling of impending doom.\\
281 - And the diarrhea.\\
282 - Oh, I'm sorry. It's just that my panic attacks come with diarrhea.\\
283 - First the clammy hands, and then the nausea, and then the aforementioned...\\
284 - ...you know. Sorry.\\
285 - I changed my mind. I want him gone.\\
286 - Can we shave his head and fill his mouth with hair first?\\
287 - Let me tell you something about hair.\\
288 - The clammy hands, that's how it starts.\\
289 - Wait a minute. You can't just kick him out like that.\\
290 - You didn't want him here in the first place.\\
291 - But I'm his brother. It's my right to reject him.\\
292 - You guys wanted him. Now that he's here, cut him a little slack.\\
293 - Can't you see? He doesn't fit in here.\\
294 - Of course not. He doesn't fit in anywhere.\\
295 - He's a weird little guy who makes phone calls from the garage.\\
296 - It's not his fault.\\
297 - His big brother didn't look after him, didn't teach him anything.\\
298 - I'm trying to make up for it with his son...\\
299 - ...but this annoying little ship has sailed.\\
300 - Thank you, Charlie. You can stop now.\\
301 - No, I got your back. I want this twerp in the group.\\
302 - A problem with that is a problem with me.\\
303 - Oh, now you've got my back?\\
304 - - What? - A little late, don't you think?\\
305 - Alan, I'm defending you.\\
306 - And I'm asking where you've been for the past 35 years.\\
307 - Let me tell you what it was like growing up.\\
308 - Un-freaking-believable.\\
309 - What it was like to look up to... No, to worship someone...\\
310 - ...who on two occasions tried to trade you for an underwater flashlight.\\
311 - It wasn't for keeps.\\
312 - No, no, no. It's my turn now, Charlie.\\
313 - All I ever wanted was his approval, his friendship.\\
314 - And all I ever got was my underwear yanked up to the base of my skull.\\
315 - And the sad part is that I looked forward to the wedgies...\\
316 - ...because it was the only form of love that I could get from him.\\
317 - - That is sad, Charlie. - It's terrible.\\
318 - Charlie, don't you think there's something you have to say to your brother?\\
319 - Yeah.\\
320 - Come here, buddy.\\
321 - Okay, buddy.\\
322 - Here's the gag\\
323 - In the words of some wag\\
324 - She loves my flag\\
325 - Rally round the flag\\
326 - Wow, Elvis, that was beautiful.\\
327 - But, you know, in all honesty...\\
328 - ...I really loved your earlier, you know, angrier stuff.\\
329 - You know, "Pump It Up." Now, that was a song.\\
330 - I gave you that.\\
331 - Oh, and while we're on the subject, Sean...\\
332 - ...why don't you do funny stuff like you used to?\\
333 - I mean, Fast Times ruled, man.\\
334 - Come on, do a little Spicoli for us.\\
335 - Guys, this isn't funny.\\
336 - Clammy hands. Nausea.\\
337 - Guys?\\
338 - Hey, guys?\\
339 - Guys?
\subsection {Episode 02: Enjoy These Garlic Balls}
1 - Tequila, checkbook, sourpuss.\\
2 - Must be alimony time.\\
3 - Go away, Charlie.\\
4 - Boy, you'd think for all that money, she'd at least come and give you a lap dance.\\
5 - - Leave me alone, Charlie. - In fact, you know what'd be funny?\\
6 - Where it says "memo," write "lap dance."\\
7 - Give her something to explain at tax time.\\
8 - Charlie, you...\\
9 - Okay.\\
10 - - So where's Jake? - Sleeping at a friend's.\\
11 - - He'll get dropped off tomorrow. - Oh, man.\\
12 - - I rented a movie he'd like. - Oh, what'd you get?\\
13 - Don't worry. It's educational.\\
14 - One Million Years B. C.? How is this educational?\\
15 - Raquel Welch running from dinosaurs in a fur bikini?\\
16 - What is that if not history?\\
17 - I'm afraid you're gonna have to watch it by yourself.\\
18 - Won't be the first time.\\
19 - What's the deal with that giraffe?\\
20 - How come you bring it out every time you write an alimony check?\\
21 - It's symbolic.\\
22 - Do you wanna know what it's symbolic of?\\
23 - No, I'm good.\\
24 - I made it in ceramics class for Judith when we were dating.\\
25 - All these years I've been shelling out for tennis bracelets and satin underwear.\\
26 - Some women aren't impressed with jewelry and lingerie.\\
27 - Well, sure, if you wanna date a dead girl.\\
28 - Hey, I just realized.\\
29 - Your name is Al, and you're sending your ex-wife money...\\
30 - ...so it's "Al-i-money."\\
31 - Hey, hey, I just realized, your name is Charlie...\\
32 - ...and you're a moron.\\
33 - Be that as it may.\\
34 - If you gave her the giraffe, why do you have it?\\
35 - When Judith kicked me out, I wanted to get back at her.\\
36 - She took the house, she took the car, she took the money.\\
37 - - I felt I had to take something. - So you stole bric-a-brac.\\
38 - - Symbolic bric-a-brac. - Oh, right.\\
39 - You see, now every month when I write the check...\\
40 - ...I can look at it and remind myself...\\
41 - ...what a pathetic loser I am.\\
42 - No, dude. You don't need a giraffe for that.\\
43 - Get rid of the damn thing.\\
44 - You're killing yourself with this bitterness.\\
45 - What, you think I'm hurting myself more than her?\\
46 - No, I don't think you're hurting her at all.\\
47 - You need to move on, buddy.\\
48 - You're right. You're right.\\
49 - And you know what would be truly symbolic of that?\\
50 - Getting your knob shined by a keno waitress in Laughlin?\\
51 - No. No.\\
52 - Me bringing this back to Judith and apologizing for taking it.\\
53 - I like my idea better.\\
54 - Okay, here's the plan.\\
55 - I'll bring this little fella back to Judith, and clean the slate.\\
56 - Did you even consider my idea?\\
57 - - You drive. - Why do I have to go?\\
58 - Because I am obviously too drunk to drive.\\
59 - What does that say about your plan?\\
60 - Alan, wait.\\
61 - You can't stop me. I am giving Judith back the giraffe.\\
62 - Oh, I don't wanna stop you. I just want a good view.\\
63 - Okay, you can stay.\\
64 - Charlie, look at this. What is this? "The Harpers."\\
65 - - Yeah, so? - She's not the Harpers anymore.\\
66 - She's the Harper.\\
67 - That mat is a complete lie.\\
68 - Yeah, and it's in cahoots with the mailbox.\\
69 - Come on, ring the bell.\\
70 - You and me, we're the Harpers.\\
71 - Us.\\
72 - Oh, Alan.\\
73 - Hi.\\
74 - Dr. Melnick. Is Jake all right?\\
75 - I assume so. He's spending the night at a friend's.\\
76 - Oh, that's right, that's right.\\
77 - Dr. Melnick is Jake's pediatrician, so naturally, I thought...\\
78 - Oh, okay.\\
79 - Looks like somebody else has given your wife the giraffe.\\
80 - Make sure they didn't forget the garlic balls.\\
81 - What are you doing here?\\
82 - Why don't I just get back in the hot tub and give you guys a minute.\\
83 - - Well? - I came to give you this.\\
84 - - What is it? - I made it for you.\\
85 - - Just now? - No, no, a long time ago.\\
86 - It's symbolic.\\
87 - Alan, you're a disturbed man. You need help.\\
88 - Enjoy those garlic balls.\\
89 - Wow, that was more fun than I expected.\\
90 - - Come on, giraffe boy, I'll buy you a drink. - Okay.\\
91 - Wait, wait, wait.\\
92 - Our pediatrician.\\
93 - My ex-wife is sleeping with our pediatrician.\\
94 - I wonder if she gets a lollipop after every visit.\\
95 - You know, you're actually a very lucky man.\\
96 - Oh, really? Really? How am I lucky, Charlie? Show me the luck.\\
97 - Well, first of all, if Jake ever gets sick or hurt...\\
98 - ...free medical care is only a hot tub away.\\
99 - Well, that's true. He is good with kids.\\
100 - I begged her to do it with me in the hot tub.\\
101 - She said it made her hair frizzy.\\
102 - Well, apparently, she's found the right conditioner.\\
103 - What if she's serious about this guy? What if she marries him?\\
104 - - Even better. - Better?\\
105 - How is it better? Show me the better.\\
106 - If she marries him, you're off the hook for alimony.\\
107 - That is better.\\
108 - In fact, if you saw the big picture, you'd encourage this relationship.\\
109 - This guy is a real catch for you. Don't let him get away.\\
110 - You're right. Maybe I should go back there...\\
111 - ...and, you know, bless their union. - No, no, no.\\
112 - You provided the woman and the hot tub.\\
113 - - That's enough for one night. - Yeah, I guess.\\
114 - - Probably even paid for the garlic balls. - Yeah.\\
115 - - Could I get some more coffee, Berta? - Who's stopping you?\\
116 - Get your own damn coffee.\\
117 - - Well, Charlie, you're finally up. - Hey, Mom.\\
118 - - Where's my grandson? - He's at a sleepover.\\
119 - - He'll be here later. - And no one calls me?\\
120 - I wouldn't come over if I'd been told he wasn't here.\\
121 - Good to know.\\
122 - Where's your brother? His car's not in the driveway.\\
123 - Hey, Mom, I'm not even sure where my pants are.\\
124 - All right. Well, looks like you and I get to spend a little quality time together.\\
125 - Gee, I'd love to, but I got my regular Sunday morning softball game.\\
126 - - Charlie. - Yeah.\\
127 - It's Saturday.\\
128 - Damn.\\
129 - - Oh, you're still here. - Yeah.\\
130 - - Listen, Alan, I'm really sorry about... - No, no, no. I should apologize to you.\\
131 - Showing up last night unannounced. That's completely inappropriate.\\
132 - And I came by to tell you it won't happen again.\\
133 - So you came over unannounced to apologize for coming over unannounced?\\
134 - I was afraid you'd pick up on that.\\
135 - - Is Judith up yet? - Actually, she's not here.\\
136 - She ran to the market.\\
137 - Up and out this early on a Saturday? Good for her.\\
138 - She used to sleep a lot when we were together.\\
139 - It was probably just the depression and the meds.\\
140 - - Meds? - Oh, no, it was nothing serious.\\
141 - Just your everyday little pink pill to turn that frown upside down.\\
142 - Alan, I gotta tell you, this is a little awkward...\\
143 - No, please, don't feel awkward.\\
144 - Look, we're obviously going to be seeing each other a lot.\\
145 - There's no reason for anybody to feel uncomfortable.\\
146 - That's a very mature attitude. Thank you.\\
147 - Well, you're welcome.\\
148 - So let me make you some coffee.\\
149 - Are we supposed to believe...\\
150 - ...that cavewomen waxed their legs and wore fur bikinis?\\
151 - It's not a documentary, Mom.\\
152 - You know, I'm not gonna be around forever...\\
153 - ...and the time will come when you'll regret ignoring me.\\
154 - - Charlie, why do you hate me? - What?\\
155 - Whenever I come, you do everything you can to avoid spending time with me.\\
156 - Obviously not everything.\\
157 - We're spending time together right now.\\
158 - You're just staring at the television, and it's not even on anymore.\\
159 - I can still see you.\\
160 - Charlie, look at me.\\
161 - - How long you wanna do this for? - I want you to talk to me.\\
162 - - Okay, I'm out of here. - No, no, wait, Berta.\\
163 - - Come, sit, talk. - Mommy-and-me time over already?\\
164 - - He hates me. - No, I don't.\\
165 - - Please, Berta, I need you. - I'm done. I wanna go home.\\
166 - - Berta, I'm begging you. - Oh, all right.\\
167 - So why do you hate your mother?\\
168 - Here we go.\\
169 - Coffee, juice, and my secret stash of Mint Milanos...\\
170 - ...from the back of the freezer.\\
171 - Just a tip: If you want quality cookies around here, you gotta hide them.\\
172 - Judith eats Pepperidge Farm like she's going to the chair.\\
173 - So tell me a little bit about yourself. Ever been married?\\
174 - - My wife passed away. - Oh, I'm so sorry.\\
175 - No alimony, though. Gotta love that.\\
176 - Hey, hey, here's a funny thing.\\
177 - My name's Al and... And I give Judith money.\\
178 - So it's... So it's alimony.\\
179 - - Wouldn't it be "Al-i-money"? - I was afraid you'd pick up on that.\\
180 - - You got kids? - No.\\
181 - Well, that's a blessing. What with the dead wife and all.\\
182 - - Mint Milanos? - No, thank you.\\
183 - So anyway, kids. Hey, you know, it's not too late for you.\\
184 - Judith is a wonderful mother.\\
185 - We're not at that stage in our relationship.\\
186 - Oh, of course not.\\
187 - On the other hand, you don't wanna wait too long. She's no spring chicken.\\
188 - You know, eggwise.\\
189 - So I'm having this nice Mother's Day dinner with my slutty daughter...\\
190 - ...and her idiot boyfriend.\\
191 - Suddenly, the front door comes down and the room fills with tear gas.\\
192 - Next thing I know, I'm belly-up on the floor, hacking out a lung...\\
193 - ...while the cops are dragging out Bonnie and Claude in handcuffs.\\
194 - Come to find out that the money that I loaned them to open a tanning salon...\\
195 - ...was used to turn my tool shed into a hydroponic pot farm.\\
196 - - Unbelievable. - Yeah.\\
197 - Your daughter came to visit on Mother's Day.\\
198 - Sure, what ungrateful mutt doesn't visit their mother on Mother's Day?\\
199 - - One year I forgot. Let it go. - When's my birthday?\\
200 - - Excuse me? - You heard me.\\
201 - - What's that got to do with anything? - You don't know your mother's birthday?\\
202 - - Well, not by heart. - Charlie.\\
203 - - What? She changes it all the time. - Just the year, not the day.\\
204 - Hey, I just realized something. I can leave.\\
205 - Fine. But before you go, just tell me one thing.\\
206 - - What? - Why do you hate me?\\
207 - Oh, Mom, for God's sakes, l... Rose!\\
208 - No, no, no. Rose, wait. Rose, come on in.\\
209 - Look, my mom's here. You like my mom.\\
210 - - Oh, sure. Hi, Evelyn. - Hello, dear.\\
211 - - Are those my pants? - Oh, no.\\
212 - I bought these.\\
213 - But I think this might be your wallet and keys.\\
214 - Evelyn, you get younger every time I see you.\\
215 - Oh, aren't you a dear. And thank you for the birthday card.\\
216 - - Oh, did you get it on time? - Yes, I did, and it was lovely.\\
217 - So sweet of you to remember me.\\
218 - How could anybody forget your birthday?\\
219 - Well, yeah. You know, she does become a little emotional at times, huh?\\
220 - I thought she was getting over your divorce.\\
221 - No, no. She was over the divorce while I was still packing.\\
222 - No, what you're seeing is low blood sugar.\\
223 - The trick to that is to always have some Fun Size Snickers in your pocket.\\
224 - - It'll perk her right up. - Really?\\
225 - Oh, yeah. Oh, and here's another tip.\\
226 - When she starts crying for no reason, and she will...\\
227 - ...never say, "Don't cry." And try not to touch her.\\
228 - - Okay. - Or whistle.\\
229 - Never, ever whistle.\\
230 - Okay, maybe I forgot a birthday or two. Maybe I don't return every single call.\\
231 - But that doesn't mean I hate her.\\
232 - Was he breast-fed?\\
233 - Of course he was. Not by me personally.\\
234 - That's interesting. I see the bras that come through here...\\
235 - ...and he does tend to favor the big yams.\\
236 - - I do not. - Oh, really?\\
237 - - Raquel Welch. - Hey, that's a damn fine film.\\
238 - Come to think of it, the night we were together...\\
239 - ...he did spend a freakish amount of time on my boobies.\\
240 - I mean, foreplay is one thing, but, golly, it was like making love to a cat.\\
241 - Rose, for God's sake, you're talking to my mother.\\
242 - Sorry. A very giving cat.\\
243 - He's always had an oral fixation.\\
244 - When he was little, he used to suck on other children's thumbs.\\
245 - And now he's always got a bottle of booze in his mouth.\\
246 - My therapist says that's his way of stuffing his feelings.\\
247 - - That's what my therapist says. - Hell, I could've told you that for free.\\
248 - - Hey, I'm here. - Hey, it's Jake.\\
249 - Back from his sleepover. Look who's here to see you, buddy.\\
250 - Hi, Grandma.\\
251 - Hello, sweetheart. Thank you for the lovely birthday card.\\
252 - - My mom picked it out. - Oh, and you love her, don't you?\\
253 - - Sure. - Thank you. You can go now.\\
254 - - Can I go too? - We're not done with you.\\
255 - - Where were we? - We were trying to figure out...\\
256 - ...why Charlie hates you. - Yeah.\\
257 - Well, Charlie?\\
258 - Okay, fine, here it is.\\
259 - I'm not saying I hate you, but if I did...\\
260 - ...it might have to do with the fact that you're a narcissistic bloodsucker...\\
261 - ...who drove my father into an early grave.\\
262 - Then married a succession of men who couldn't care less about Alan and me...\\
263 - ...which was fine with you...\\
264 - ...because you looked at us like dancing monkeys...\\
265 - ...you could just haul out whenever it suited you.\\
266 - And when it didn't, you sent us off to boarding school or camp...\\
267 - ...or that kibbutz in Israel, where we got beat up...\\
268 - ...because we weren't even Jewish!\\
269 - And now, now you show up here every chance you get...\\
270 - ...to lay a guilt trip on me...\\
271 - ...for not appreciating my cold, Ionely, loveless childhood.\\
272 - Well...\\
273 - ...obviously you're not ready to talk about it.\\
274 - - Alan, you really don't have to do this. - Hey, hey, I am a licensed chiropractor.\\
275 - If Jake had a sore throat, I'm sure you'd treat him, prescribe something.\\
276 - But it's nothing, I think I just slept wrong.\\
277 - Oh, that's probably because you're not used to our bed.\\
278 - So have you...? Have you met Judith's parents?\\
279 - - No. - Oh, they are just gonna love you.\\
280 - They were devastated by the divorce.\\
281 - Not to mention some of her unfortunate choices thereafter.\\
282 - - Unfortunate choices? - Oh, you know, that's not important.\\
283 - What's important is they're just gonna be relieved to see she's dating a man.\\
284 - You carry a lot of tension up here.\\
285 - Alan.\\
286 - - Didn't you just pay your alimony? - This is the pediatrician's bill.\\
287 - - Jake was sick? - No, no.\\
288 - The pediatrician had to see an orthopedist.\\
289 - You know Mom's birthday was a couple weeks ago?\\
290 - Yeah, I sent her some flowers and a card.\\
291 - Oh, man. Would it have killed you to put my name on the card?\\
292 - I did put your name on it. I wrote, "Love, your sons, Alan and Charlie."\\
293 - - Damn. - What?\\
294 - She tricked me into thinking I forgot.
\subsection {Episode 03: A Bag Full of Jawea}
1 - I don't know what he did, Charlie.\\
2 - The teacher called and told me to come get him.\\
3 - I want it on the record that if the kid was running...\\
4 - ...a blackjack game under bleachers he didn't get it from me.\\
5 - What? I said, he didn't.\\
6 - Well, I can assure you he did not learn that kind of crass behavior from me.\\
7 - Maybe I should wait in the hall.\\
8 - Hold on. What is he doing here?\\
9 - Well, my car is in the shop, and Charlie was nice enough to give me a ride.\\
10 - No, Charlie was nice enough to call you a cab, but you wouldn't take it.\\
11 - So, what's going on?\\
12 - Your son gave his teacher the bird.\\
13 - Okay, I want it on the record that he didn't necessarily...\\
14 - Charlie, just leave it alone. What exactly happened?\\
15 - I was writing on the board and he thought I couldn't see him.\\
16 - - Is this true? - Yeah, I really thought she couldn't see.\\
17 - I'm afraid this kind of behavior is grounds for suspension.\\
18 - - Maybe we can catch a matinee. - Yeah.\\
19 - Jake, why did you flip Miss Pasternak off?\\
20 - Excuse me. We don't end our sentences with prepositions.\\
21 - We say, "Why did you flip off Miss Pasternak?"\\
22 - I think that answers your question.\\
23 - Jake, why did you flip off Miss Pasternak?\\
24 - Because she picks on me.\\
25 - Jake, I don't treat you any differently than any of the other students.\\
26 - - Yeah, right. - Shut up.\\
27 - You know, I'd like to talk to your parents alone.\\
28 - - Come on, Jake. - What, I don't even get to tell my side?\\
29 - Buddy, you're 11. You have no side.\\
30 - This isn't my fault. I was provoked.\\
31 - - You were provoked? - Yeah, it means...\\
32 - I know what it means.\\
33 - And it doesn't matter. What you need to do now is apologize.\\
34 - - But I'm not sorry. - You don't have to be sorry.\\
35 - Just say it and look it. You've got those big, cute kid eyes. Use them.\\
36 - - That would be lying. - That's your line in the sand?\\
37 - You muttonhead, you just flipped off your teacher.\\
38 - - Yeah, but I was being honest. - And look where it got you.\\
39 - I think I just lost my innocence.\\
40 - He's really a very well-behaved boy...\\
41 - ...but he has had some problems dealing with our separation.\\
42 - That's true. Although it wasn't so much a separation as a kicking out.\\
43 - I sympathize, but if I gave special consideration to every child...\\
44 - ...whose parents are going through divorce, I'd be getting the finger all day.\\
45 - We're not saying he shouldn't be punished.\\
46 - - He certainly should. - But just let us try to handle it.\\
47 - By "us" he means me. I always have to be the bad guy.\\
48 - You're better at it than me.\\
49 - Than I.\\
50 - You are such an ass.\\
51 - - Can we have a moment, please? - I think that'd be a good idea.\\
52 - And it's, "May we have a moment, please?"\\
53 - Stop it.\\
54 - Miss Pasternak. I'm sorry, we haven't officially met.\\
55 - - I'm Jake's uncle, Charlie. - Hello.\\
56 - And I am really sorry. This may not be my place...\\
57 - ...and if it's not, I am really sorry...\\
58 - ...but Jake has something he wants to say.\\
59 - I am really sorry.\\
60 - - And I'm really sorry too. - Why are you sorry?\\
61 - The kid may have gotten the rude gesture from me.\\
62 - I'm not used to being around children and, well, I am really sorry.\\
63 - Well, thank you. I appreciate it, but it doesn't change what Jake did.\\
64 - You're right. You're absolutely right.\\
65 - Jake, go to the vending machine...\\
66 - ...and get Miss Pasternak a peach Snapple and a bag of Skittles.\\
67 - It is Miss Pasternak, right?\\
68 - Now, this one's called "Read Between the Lines."\\
69 - You're giving the finger, but you've got plausible deniability.\\
70 - Cool. Like the Itchy Eye.\\
71 - Exactly. Now, this one's called "the Slow Crank."\\
72 - Charlie.\\
73 - As you can see, it's effective but lacks deniability.\\
74 - - Dad, check it out. Balloon Finger. - Okay, that's enough.\\
75 - Do we need to be teaching him more ways to flip people off?\\
76 - Flip off people.\\
77 - Charlie, do you realize how close he came to being suspended today?\\
78 - - I do. - And do you understand...\\
79 - ...how lucky we are Miss Pasternak decided to give him a chance?\\
80 - Lucky? Sure, why not. Let's call it luck.\\
81 - What does that mean?\\
82 - It means I'm too modest to call it skill.\\
83 - - Hey, Dad. - What?\\
84 - How come only one finger is the bad finger?\\
85 - I don't know, Jake.\\
86 - This one's okay, right?\\
87 - Right.\\
88 - - Dad. - What?\\
89 - Anything?\\
90 - No.\\
91 - I don't get it. Who decides?\\
92 - Uncle Charlie, I had a weird dream.\\
93 - And it's getting weirder.\\
94 - Hey, buddy. Why aren't you asleep?\\
95 - I'm hoping I am.\\
96 - - Hello, Jake. - Hello, Miss Pasternak.\\
97 - Listen, buddy, Miss Pasternak and I are kind of having a sleepover.\\
98 - Because we're like, you know, friends.\\
99 - No way.\\
100 - Jake, I'm only your teacher from 8: 15 to 3:00.\\
101 - After that I'm just a person like anybody else.\\
102 - This is more wrong than the time I saw Santa peeing at the mall.\\
103 - Okay, why don't we wrap up this after-school special and call it a night.\\
104 - Don't worry. This won't change anything between us at school.\\
105 - So you're still gonna be mean to me?\\
106 - That's right. Same old junkyard dog.\\
107 - - Come on, buddy. Get some sleep. - Oh, yeah. Like I'm gonna sleep now.\\
108 - - Do you think he'll be okay? - Sure.\\
109 - He's just not used to seeing his teacher out of the classroom.\\
110 - And her pants.\\
111 - I'll talk to him in the morning and make sure he's okay...\\
112 - ...and that he keeps this to himself. - Thank you, Charlie.\\
113 - Oh, Miss Pasternak.\\
114 - Why do you never call me by my first name?\\
115 - I don't know. This just seems way hotter.\\
116 - - Charlie? - Yes, Miss Pasternak.\\
117 - Do you think Jake believes we're just friends?\\
118 - Why not? We are, right?\\
119 - I mean, once I get to know you better I'm pretty sure I'd consider you a friend.\\
120 - Charlie, we both know there's much more than friendship...\\
121 - ...going on between you and me. - Much more?\\
122 - How much more?\\
123 - Well, I know this is pretty quick and I don't wanna use the L word...\\
124 - - Good. Thank you. ...but this feels an awful lot like love.\\
125 - I'm sorry, which L word didn't you want to use?\\
126 - Oh, Charlie. Come on.\\
127 - - Let's go to sleep. - Yeah. Like I'm gonna sleep now.\\
128 - - Morning. What are you doing? - Morning.\\
129 - Making my world-famous huevos rancheros for my brother and nephew.\\
130 - No kidding. What stupid thing did you do you're trying to make up for?\\
131 - Why do you always just assume that...?\\
132 - I slept with Jake's teacher.\\
133 - Oh, Charlie, did you learn nothing from the den-mother fiasco?\\
134 - It gets worse. The kid found out.\\
135 - - What about your brother? - He doesn't know yet.\\
136 - Oh, hey, you made breakfast. What's the occasion?\\
137 - No occasion. Just trying to help out.\\
138 - Well, thank you. I really appreciate it. Good morning, Berta.\\
139 - Morning, you goofy, clueless bastard.\\
140 - Nice to see her in a pleasant mood for a change.\\
141 - Yeah. Sit down.\\
142 - Have some huevos.\\
143 - - Fresh-squeezed orange juice. - You squeezed this?\\
144 - No, it says it on the can.\\
145 - Okay, what stupid thing did you do?\\
146 - Well, funny thing...\\
147 - I slept with Miss Pasternak.\\
148 - Charlie, what were you thinking?\\
149 - What if Jake finds out?\\
150 - Okay...\\
151 - Oh, no! Oh, no! How?\\
152 - - He woke up in the middle of the night... - You brought her here?\\
153 - Did you learn nothing from the den-mother fiasco?\\
154 - - Hey, I kept him from getting suspended. - Oh, that's how?\\
155 - - You're welcome. - Are you crazy?\\
156 - No, but I have a sneaking suspicion Miss Pasternak may be.\\
157 - - What's that supposed to mean? - Don't worry, I'll deal with it.\\
158 - Oh, that makes me feel much better.\\
159 - So how did Jake take it? Did he freak out?\\
160 - Not as much as you.\\
161 - - Morning. - See? He's fine.\\
162 - Jake, do you wanna talk about what you saw last night...\\
163 - ...with Uncle Charlie and Miss Pasternak?\\
164 - Oh, God. That really happened?\\
165 - Good, Alan. Way to go.\\
166 - Dad, can I be homeschooled?\\
167 - Listen, Jake. Don't worry.\\
168 - You go to school, don't say anything to anybody.\\
169 - I'll tell her I can't see her anymore and we'll forget this happened.\\
170 - Man, it's like Cub Scouts all over again.\\
171 - - I hope you saved room for dessert. - I saved room for you.\\
172 - You sure? Because I'm just empty calories.\\
173 - How about a nice fruit cup?\\
174 - Two fruit cups, please.\\
175 - Listen, Delores. We need to talk.\\
176 - Oh, call me Miss Pasternak.\\
177 - No, let's keep this friendly.\\
178 - Dolores, you're a terrific woman and I've enjoyed being with you very much...\\
179 - ...but I know deep in my heart that you can do so much better than me.\\
180 - - Okay. I understand. - Good. Thank you.\\
181 - You're insecure. But don't worry. I am not going to abandon you.\\
182 - No, no, no, that's not what I'm worried about.\\
183 - See, Delores...\\
184 - I'm a bad man.\\
185 - I'm a player. I go from woman to woman and then...\\
186 - Charlie, that's the past.\\
187 - I'm not going to give up on us, and you wanna know why?\\
188 - Why?\\
189 - Because somebody told me that we belong together.\\
190 - Really? It can't be somebody who knows me.\\
191 - Oh, he knows you very well.\\
192 - And he loves you even more than I do.\\
193 - Our union has been ordained, Charlie.\\
194 - What? Come again?\\
195 - After we fornicated...\\
196 - ...I prayed for forgiveness and I was told not to worry about it.\\
197 - By the same guy?\\
198 - There's only one guy, Charlie.\\
199 - And his loving hand has been guiding me ever since I quit pole dancing in Reno.\\
200 - No kidding. Which club?\\
201 - - Did you dress like a schoolteacher? - It doesn't matter.\\
202 - What matters is the same hand that delivered me...\\
203 - ...from my life of degradation has brought me to you.\\
204 - For what? More degradation?\\
205 - No. To help you become a better man. To achieve your potential.\\
206 - Now sit up straight and eat your fruit.\\
207 - - All right. - All right, what?\\
208 - All right, Miss Pasternak.\\
209 - Hey, Charlie. Guess who.\\
210 - I know we didn 't make plans for tonight but we really should get together...\\
211 - ... and talk more about this path we are on and where it's heading.\\
212 - We know where it's heading but it would mean a lot to me...\\
213 - ... to hear the words come out of your mouth.\\
214 - Your beautiful, blessed mouth.\\
215 - Call me, sweetheart.\\
216 - Boy, it's weird being on the other side of one of these calls.\\
217 - I can imagine. Well?\\
218 - - Professional opinion? - Please.\\
219 - Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.\\
220 - Yeah, I thought so.\\
221 - I mean, she barely knows you.\\
222 - Where does she get off being so forward?\\
223 - Rose, we had one night together and you handcuffed yourself to my refrigerator.\\
224 - That was different. We were meant to be together.\\
225 - Okay, I was gonna ask you the best way to end this...\\
226 - ...but I realize now that breakups may be outside your area of expertise.\\
227 - Yeah. I do mate for life. I'm like a penguin that way.\\
228 - Plus, I like to slide across the ice on my belly.\\
229 - Uncle Charlie, guess what happened with Miss Pasternak today.\\
230 - - I'm just about to break up with her. - Oh, no, don't, don't.\\
231 - - Why not? - Look at this.\\
232 - Hey, you got an A in history.\\
233 - - Way to go, Jake. - Look at his answers.\\
234 - "Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in pen."\\
235 - For this he got an A?\\
236 - Everybody got an A. She was, like, happy all day.\\
237 - She even gave me back my fake dog poop.\\
238 - Charlie, I gave you this poop.\\
239 - You broke into my house and left it on my pillow.\\
240 - Still, you regifted.\\
241 - And I thought you were a classy guy.\\
242 - Jake, why don't you go to your room and do your homework.\\
243 - She didn't give us any. First time ever.\\
244 - I love you, Uncle Charlie.\\
245 - - Oh, man. - Yeah.\\
246 - Yeah, I think you know what you have to do.\\
247 - - Break up with Miss Pasternak, right? - Hell, no. He's getting A's.\\
248 - He hasn't gotten an A since naptime in kindergarten.\\
249 - - But he's not learning anything. - Charlie, get your priorities straight.\\
250 - I'm trying to get him into a decent middle school.\\
251 - After he's accepted he can learn that Sacajawea...\\
252 - ...wasn't "a bag full of jawea."\\
253 - - Ready for dinner? - Charlie!\\
254 - It's so good to see you.\\
255 - It's okay to see you too.\\
256 - - Charlie. - What?\\
257 - - Gum. - Oh, sorry.\\
258 - What a great day I had.\\
259 - All the kids were so well-behaved. Even Jake.\\
260 - - That's nice. - Can I tell you a little secret?\\
261 - I never really cared for Jake.\\
262 - But you said you treated him like all the other kids.\\
263 - Well, you have to say that.\\
264 - So where are we going to dinner?\\
265 - I hadn't really decided.\\
266 - You came unprepared?\\
267 - Charlie, you have so much potential if only you'd apply yourself.\\
268 - All right, I gotta tell you.\\
269 - My weirdness bar for chicks is pretty high...\\
270 - ...but you are clearing it in street shoes.\\
271 - You're mad at me.\\
272 - - No, no. - Yes, you are.\\
273 - - No, no. Not... Not mad. - Then what's your problem?\\
274 - Nothing. Forget it. Let's just have a nice evening.\\
275 - Oh, Charlie, that is so sweet.\\
276 - Let's never fight again.\\
277 - Oh, no. I hate it.\\
278 - Hey, can I use the restroom?\\
279 - May I use the restroom?\\
280 - Oh, right.\\
281 - - May I? - You're excused.\\
282 - Thank you.\\
283 - Charlie.\\
284 - Look, I'm really sorry it didn't work out with Miss Pasternak.\\
285 - You gotta know, I went the extra mile to make her happy.\\
286 - Alan, you know what that means, and Jake, you'll understand someday.\\
287 - Oh, come on, guys. I said I'm sorry.\\
288 - Okay, she's being really unfair with all this homework.\\
289 - You know what I'll do? I'm gonna complain to the principal.\\
290 - Maybe you should date the principal.\\
291 - Very funny.\\
292 - Is that an option?\\
293 - Because I would if it would get me out of writing 2500 words...\\
294 - ...on The Red Badge of Courage.\\
295 - Man, book reports suck.\\
296 - - Dad. - Yeah?\\
297 - Please keep him away from my karate teacher.
\subsection {Episode 04: Go Get Mommy's Bra}
1 - - Hey, Alan? - Yeah?\\
2 - You had the "just say no" talk with Jake, right?\\
3 - Of course. Why? What talk did you have with him?\\
4 - No talk, it's just that he's...\\
5 - It'll be more fun if you see it.\\
6 - I'm guessing you don't mean fun for me.\\
7 - Tell the truth. How proud do you feel at this moment?\\
8 - What the hell is he doing?\\
9 - I don't know. Ten bucks says he hits the ceiling if we turn on the garbage disposal.\\
10 - - Jake, what are you doing? - Breathing.\\
11 - Breathing. Any particular reason you're doing that in the sink?\\
12 - I have to practice.\\
13 - Man, the girls are gonna love him when he grows up.\\
14 - - Jake? - Yes?\\
15 - - I'll bring him up. - Yeah.\\
16 - Hey, that's not funny. I could have drowned.\\
17 - And then we'd have found your body days later, washed up on the dish rack.\\
18 - - Where did you get all this snorkel stuff? - Greg bought it for me.\\
19 - - Greg? - Yeah, you know, Dr. Melnick...\\
20 - ...Mom's boyfriend. He's a real cool guy.\\
21 - He's gonna teach me how to scuba-dive after I learn to snorkel.\\
22 - We're gonna need a bigger sink.\\
23 - He's got a gigantic boat with bedrooms on it, and scuba tanks and wet suits.\\
24 - We're gonna go diving off Catalina. Wait till you see the flippers he bought me.\\
25 - Well, Judith's boyfriend sounds like quite a guy.\\
26 - - Yeah. - You okay with that?\\
27 - Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.\\
28 - This can be a sensitive area for divorced guys.\\
29 - - I know. - Ex-wife sleeping with another man.\\
30 - - Son starting to bond with him. - Yeah. Yeah.\\
31 - - Big boat. - Charlie, what's your freaking point here?\\
32 - No point. Just drilling for the nerve.\\
33 - So, what do you think? You wanna go bowling today? Maybe catch a movie?\\
34 - No, I'm gonna take another bath.\\
35 - He does know there's an ocean out there, right?\\
36 - Well, Greg doesn't want him in the ocean.\\
37 - He wants him to spend time training in a pool.\\
38 - In fact, my son's a little unhappy about being here...\\
39 - ...because he wanted to go snorkeling in Greg's pool.\\
40 - He's got a boat and a pool?\\
41 - I guess you can afford cool stuff...\\
42 - ...when you don't have to sell your blood and sperm to make alimony payments.\\
43 - Hey, hey, my relationship with my son is not based on having cool stuff.\\
44 - And lucky for you.\\
45 - - Come on, look at the bright side. - What bright side, Charlie?\\
46 - Delineate the bright side.\\
47 - Maybe one weekend Greg will let us take a couple of chicks out on the boat.\\
48 - Why on earth would he lend us his boat?\\
49 - He's tight with Jake, we're tight with Jake. We've got an in.\\
50 - Are you not hearing my pain? My son likes Judith's boyfriend better than me.\\
51 - Hey, I don't even know him and I like him better than you.\\
52 - You'd think I'd learn.\\
53 - Alan. Alan, your son loves you. You're a big influence on him.\\
54 - - You are the most important role model. - Oh, I guess.\\
55 - I mean, so what if you can't teach him to scuba-dive.\\
56 - For that matter, you can't teach him to ski...\\
57 - ...or hit a curve ball or anything cool, really.\\
58 - But you bring plenty of other things to the table.\\
59 - Thank you, God.\\
60 - - Hello, Charlie. - Always a price, isn't there?\\
61 - - Hello, Alan. - Jake's taking a bath.\\
62 - As much as I'd love to spend time with my grandson, I'm in a hurry.\\
63 - Need to borrow your Mercedes.\\
64 - Well, since you're in a hurry, I'll give you a quick answer. No.\\
65 - Charlie, please. I'm showing a house in half an hour.\\
66 - What's wrong with that little electric car you bought?\\
67 - Nothing, it's fine. It's what anybody who cares about this planet is driving.\\
68 - If you're trying to sell real estate to a Saudi oil prince...\\
69 - ...you can't be driving up in some little toy car with a plug in the bumper.\\
70 - You could use my car, Mom.\\
71 - You see? Now, that is how a loving son treats his mother.\\
72 - Thank you, sweetheart, but I need to look successful.\\
73 - - Charlie, your Mercedes. - No, forget it.\\
74 - - Charlie, I am not leaving until you give... - Happy motoring.\\
75 - Thank you.\\
76 - My car is in your driveway.\\
77 - And if you lose power, there's a kite and a key in the trunk.\\
78 - For the record, there are other ways of measuring success besides cars.\\
79 - You're right. There's boats and pools.\\
80 - You know what? I hope Mom puts a dent in your big, shiny, new Mercedes.\\
81 - Hey, don't say that.\\
82 - If you're gonna hope for something, hope she drives it off a cliff.\\
83 - So this is pretty cool, huh, Jake? An electric car.\\
84 - I guess. What happens when the batteries run out?\\
85 - You plug it in and recharge it.\\
86 - But what if there's a blackout?\\
87 - You sit in the back seat with a pistol...\\
88 - ...and wait for the looters, just like any other car.\\
89 - - Charlie. - It's a cool car, Jake.\\
90 - Greg has a really cool car. He has a Hummer.\\
91 - You know, your Uncle Charlie's no stranger to Hummers.\\
92 - Charlie.\\
93 - That's a cool car too, Jake.\\
94 - So, Jake, this is pretty cool, huh?\\
95 - Driving in a futuristic car, going to see a movie.\\
96 - Hey, maybe afterwards we can go get some pizza.\\
97 - Sure.\\
98 - And then, who knows, maybe... Maybe your old dad will buy you...\\
99 - ...an excessively violent and bloody video game. How's that sound?\\
100 - Okay.\\
101 - You know, when we go scuba diving...\\
102 - ...Greg's gonna teach me how to steer his boat.\\
103 - Well, I am sorry, Jake, but, you know, I don't have a boat.\\
104 - I don't have a Hummer, and I don't know how to scuba-dive.\\
105 - It's okay, Dad. Greg does.\\
106 - Hey, Jake, how'd you like your dad to teach you how to drive a car?\\
107 - - What? - Really?\\
108 - Charlie, he's 11.\\
109 - So? We'll find an empty parking lot.\\
110 - - What if he hits something? - Alan, it's Mom's car.\\
111 - Guess what? Daddy's gonna teach you how to drive.\\
112 - Cool.\\
113 - Can you reach the pedals?\\
114 - - Yeah. Can we turn on the radio? - Forget the radio.\\
115 - Which one's the window squirter?\\
116 - Okay, forget the squirter. Now, come on, focus.\\
117 - This is your rear-view mirror. It's very important to check it before you back up.\\
118 - - Okay. - Now... Well, what do you see?\\
119 - The top of Uncle Charlie's head.\\
120 - A shopping cart, a tree, soda can.\\
121 - - Looks like Mountain Dew. - Okay.\\
122 - Forget the rear-view mirror. We're just... We're just gonna go forward.\\
123 - Now, you know, this is the brake and this is the gas.\\
124 - Thought it was electric.\\
125 - He's got you there, Alan.\\
126 - Okay, this is the brake and this is the electric.\\
127 - They're very, very sensitive. You don't have to press hard.\\
128 - Okay.\\
129 - Now, give it a little tap.\\
130 - - It is on? - No.\\
131 - - Brake! Brake! Brake! - Brake! Brake! Brake!\\
132 - Okay. Apparently it is on.\\
133 - - This is awesome. - You see how careful you have to be?\\
134 - And how much closer we are to the Dumpsters?\\
135 - - Can I squirt the windows now? - No.\\
136 - Now... Okay, why don't you turn the wheel slightly to the left...\\
137 - ...and very gently press down on...\\
138 - Brake! Brake! Brake!\\
139 - Remember, if you wanna drive Grandma's car again...\\
140 - ...you can't be telling her about it. - I know.\\
141 - Or Mom, or anybody else. Daddy doesn't need the grief.\\
142 - That was really cool, Dad. Thanks.\\
143 - - Yeah. Yeah, it was. - Hey, it just occurred to me.\\
144 - If Greg's here, we can ask him about going out on the boat.\\
145 - No, I'm not going to ask Greg about going...\\
146 - Hi, Judith. Here he is, safe and sound.\\
147 - - Hey, honey. - Hey, Mom. Guess what we just did.\\
148 - - What? - Nothing in particular.\\
149 - That's a kids' joke. "Nothing in particular."\\
150 - He's been doing it to us all weekend.\\
151 - - So, well, okay. Bye. - Alan.\\
152 - Alan.\\
153 - Ask about the boat.\\
154 - - Listen, next weekend... - Yeah, yeah.\\
155 - I know. You and Greg are taking Jake scuba diving.\\
156 - No, that's the thing.\\
157 - Greg and I have decided not to see each other.\\
158 - So if you haven't made any plans, you can have Jake.\\
159 - Oh, yeah, yeah. I'd love to have him.\\
160 - And I'm sorry to hear about you and Greg.\\
161 - - Thank you. - Is there anything I can do?\\
162 - Yeah, you can wipe that smirk off your face.\\
163 - - Okay. Well... Well, bye. - Bye.\\
164 - She broke up with Greg She broke up with Greg\\
165 - She broke up with Greg\\
166 - - Alan? - Yeah?\\
167 - Peephole.\\
168 - - Hey. - Where have you been?\\
169 - Car wash. They found something real interesting in the back seat.\\
170 - Oh, yeah, what?\\
171 - Okay, now you're just showing off.\\
172 - No, Alan, I'm not.\\
173 - Although I have to admit, that is a sexy little item.\\
174 - - It is, isn't it? - Yeah, yeah.\\
175 - I'd like to meet the lady who fills this.\\
176 - Actually, you know her.\\
177 - - Oh, really? Lisa? - No.\\
178 - - Jennifer? - Who's Jennifer?\\
179 - Oh, right. No.\\
180 - Well, then who?\\
181 - I can tell you, but once I do, I can't untell you.\\
182 - - What are you talking about? - Who borrowed my car last weekend?\\
183 - Holy mother of God.\\
184 - No. No. Unholy mother of us.\\
185 - Mom in a car?\\
186 - Mom in my car.\\
187 - If I'd known this was gonna happen, I'd have gotten the vinyl seats.\\
188 - Wait. You're not just gonna leave it in the middle of the floor, are you?\\
189 - Really creeps you out, doesn't it?\\
190 - - No. - Then pick it up.\\
191 - Hello? Oh, oh, hi, Jake. What's up?\\
192 - Slow down there.\\
193 - Yeah. No, I know your mom broke up with Greg.\\
194 - Yes. I understand that you're very upset, but...\\
195 - Well, no, no.\\
196 - I can't come over there and pick you up just because you're mad at your mother.\\
197 - Well... I'm sorry, that's just the way it is.\\
198 - Now, why don't you let me speak to her.\\
199 - Yeah, Judith, hi. Look, I am trying to back you up here.\\
200 - No, I told him he had to work it out with you.\\
201 - No, no... Really?\\
202 - You think it would be better if he came over here to cool off?\\
203 - Okay, but...\\
204 - Well, bring him over, then.\\
205 - Well... No, I'll see you in a bit.\\
206 - - Jake's coming over? - Yeah, yeah.\\
207 - Apparently he's furious with his mother about this Greg thing.\\
208 - Well, that's understandable. He was just getting to know this amazing guy...\\
209 - ...who had a boat and a pool and a Hummer.\\
210 - A guy who could teach him all sorts of cool stuff.\\
211 - And then his mother just rips this wonderful man out of his life.\\
212 - Too soon?\\
213 - Hello. Everybody decent?\\
214 - Oh, hi, Mom. What a surprise.\\
215 - Well, I was in the neighborhood and I thought I'd drop by...\\
216 - ...and see how my sons are getting along.\\
217 - - Well, we're doing fine. - Yep, just fine.\\
218 - - Good. Jake? - He's... He's fine.\\
219 - Just dandy.\\
220 - Oh, the hell with it.\\
221 - I left a $300 bra in the back seat of your Mercedes, and I want it back.\\
222 - Oh, my. How in heaven's name did that happen, Mother?\\
223 - - Well, if you must know... - I don't need to know.\\
224 - Oh, Alan, grow up.\\
225 - I sold a 12-million-dollar house and I wanted to celebrate.\\
226 - With the Saudi prince?\\
227 - Don't be ridiculous. He's got nine wives and they're all like 11 years old.\\
228 - No, I was with the seller's realtor.\\
229 - Splitting that juicy commission made us both so hot...\\
230 - ...we barely made it off the front lawn.\\
231 - Now, go get Mommy's bra.\\
232 - Oh, darling, that is just sick.\\
233 - Seek help.\\
234 - Hey.\\
235 - - Hey, what's going on? - My mom broke up with Greg.\\
236 - I heard.\\
237 - I'm gonna live here with you and Dad from now on.\\
238 - Wanna bet?\\
239 - - Why not? - Two reasons:\\
240 - Your mother loves you, and life is cruel.\\
241 - Wait, that may just be one reason.\\
242 - Well, maybe my dad can talk my mom into getting back together with Greg.\\
243 - Enjoy fifth grade, kid. You're obviously gonna be there for a while.\\
244 - What am I supposed to do, Alan?\\
245 - I know how much he liked Greg...\\
246 - ...but that can't be the reason for me to keep seeing him.\\
247 - I understand. You're not wrong here.\\
248 - I'm not? Because I certainly feel wrong.\\
249 - I failed as a wife. I'm failing as a mother.\\
250 - I even blew it as a lesbian.\\
251 - That might have been the problem.\\
252 - You're not a failure. We're both at fault for the marriage not working.\\
253 - You're a great mother. And I'm sure you would have made a heck of a lesbian...\\
254 - ...if you just hung in there a little longer.\\
255 - I'm gonna take Jake out so you guys can talk.\\
256 - - Thank you. - Thanks, Charlie.\\
257 - - Where we going? - I gotta trade in my car.\\
258 - Why are you trading this car in? Didn't you just get it?\\
259 - Yeah, but there's a banging noise that's driving me crazy.\\
260 - I don't hear anything.\\
261 - You're not in my head.\\
262 - Hey, as long as you're getting rid of it, mind if I take it for a little spin?\\
263 - Get real.\\
264 - I promise I'll go really slow.\\
265 - Forget it. It's not gonna happen.\\
266 - Is that a footprint up there?\\
267 - I never should have brought Jake into the relationship. It was too soon.\\
268 - Don't be too hard on yourself.\\
269 - So Greg didn't turn out to be the great guy you thought he was gonna be.\\
270 - Oh, he was a great guy. My God, Alan, he took my breath away.\\
271 - Our first night together he picked me up and carried me to bed in his arms.\\
272 - Well, the point is you brought Jake into the relationship too soon.\\
273 - Greg said I was too demanding. I am, aren't I?\\
274 - - I am a demanding, angry shrew. - Hey, hey.\\
275 - Don't say that. That... That is not who you are.\\
276 - That's just who you've become.\\
277 - But, you know, underneath it all...\\
278 - ...I can still see the frightened, neurotic girl...\\
279 - ...with the minor eating disorder that I fell in love with.\\
280 - Oh, Alan.\\
281 - I don't get it. This is exactly like your other car.\\
282 - No, it's not. Listen. No banging.\\
283 - Well, I think you should have gotten a cool car like Greg.\\
284 - Hey, do yourself a favor and stop worshiping this dude.\\
285 - There's a guy in your life who's worth looking up to...\\
286 - ...and modeling yourself after.\\
287 - - Dad? - Okay, two guys.\\
288 - Well, I still don't understand why my mom had to break up with Greg.\\
289 - It could have been worse. She could have married him and then broken up.\\
290 - When I was your age, I was already on my third stepfather.\\
291 - And I kind of liked the second one.\\
292 - Well, how did you feel?\\
293 - How do you think I felt? I was pissed off.\\
294 - - Yeah, well, so am I. - And I'm not saying you shouldn't be...\\
295 - ...but you can't blame your mother. She's gotta do what's right for her.\\
296 - - You understand? - I guess.\\
297 - Good.\\
298 - The next time you see her, give her a big hug...\\
299 - ...and let her know that there's still one guy who's willing to live with her.\\
300 - Okay.\\
301 - Wait, you blame your mom for everything.\\
302 - That's different. My mom's Satan.\\
303 - Come on, let's go boat shopping.\\
304 - If I'm old enough to drive...\\
305 - ...I'm old enough to know what's going on with you and Mom.\\
306 - You're not old enough to drive.\\
307 - I don't believe that you were carrying her because she twisted her ankle.\\
308 - Believe what you want. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.\\
309 - Tell him, Charlie.\\
310 - Your parents were about to have sex when we walked in.\\
311 - Yeah, right.
\subsection {Episode 05: Bad News from the Clinic}
1 - - Have any homework this weekend? - A little.\\
2 - Why don't you get started on it tonight.\\
3 - But it's only Friday.\\
4 - I know, but if you do it tonight, you won't worry.\\
5 - I'm not worried.\\
6 - Hey. What are you guys up to tonight?\\
7 - - Jake's gonna do his homework. - Why?\\
8 - It's only Friday.\\
9 - Let me tell you something about Charlie.\\
10 - He was a lousy student. He always put off doing his homework...\\
11 - ...and his grades reflected it. - Seems like he's doing okay now.\\
12 - - Go get your books. - I left my books at Mom's.\\
13 - - Fine. I'll have her bring them over. - Okay. They're in my bag.\\
14 - Go get them.\\
15 - Okay. Well, don't wait up.\\
16 - - Pretty confident, huh? - Yeah.\\
17 - Thus, the "don't wait up."\\
18 - Didn't you meet this girl a couple of days ago?\\
19 - Yup. So tonight's the night. You know, the three-day rule.\\
20 - That's the three-date rule.\\
21 - Three dates? That's crazy talk.\\
22 - All right. If you bring her back here, please be discreet.\\
23 - Don't worry. First night's always at her place.\\
24 - - Is that another rule? - No. It's just a common courtesy.\\
25 - A woman's more relaxed and comfortable in her own surroundings.\\
26 - Plus, the minute she falls asleep, I can hit the bricks.\\
27 - That's lovely. It's a shame you don't work for Hallmark.\\
28 - Yeah, I'll bet those guys get laid like crazy.\\
29 - - Goodnight, buddy. - Night.\\
30 - What happened to my chicken nuggets?\\
31 - What are you talking about? You ate them.\\
32 - Now, stop procrastinating and do your homework.\\
33 - What does procrastinating mean?\\
34 - It means putting off stuff that you have to do.\\
35 - - Can you use it in a sentence? - I just did.\\
36 - Oh, yeah.\\
37 - Did I tell you a bug flew in my ear today?\\
38 - Charlie?\\
39 - - You asleep? - What? No.\\
40 - No. You?\\
41 - Listen, I have to get up early tomorrow, so...\\
42 - - You want me to leave? - Do you mind?\\
43 - No, I'm cool either way: Stay or go.\\
44 - Okay.\\
45 - So I'm going?\\
46 - Thanks, you're a doll.\\
47 - You know, I actually prefer waking up in my own bed.\\
48 - Personal little quirk.\\
49 - - You don't mind, right? - Not at all.\\
50 - Good.\\
51 - So this worked out well for all concerned, huh?\\
52 - It was fantastic. We'll have to do it again.\\
53 - Absolutely.\\
54 - - But not tonight? - No.\\
55 - - Okay. Well, I'll call you. - It's probably easier if I call you.\\
56 - Sure. Either way.\\
57 - - I call you, you call me. - I'll call you.\\
58 - Good.\\
59 - - So I guess I'll just let myself out. - Okay.\\
60 - Sherri, you asleep?\\
61 - Finally.\\
62 - - How was school this week? - Okay.\\
63 - - Any homework for the weekend? - Nope.\\
64 - - Really? - Okay, yes.\\
65 - Do we have to go through this every Friday?\\
66 - I'd rather we didn't.\\
67 - Curly fries.\\
68 - When I was your age, we didn't even have curly fries.\\
69 - We had to make do with straight or crinkle cut.\\
70 - - What? - I'm just trying to distract you...\\
71 - ...while I steal your fries. - Hey.\\
72 - Jake, don't be selfish. Let him have one.\\
73 - So no date tonight?\\
74 - I thought I'd just hang with you guys.\\
75 - - What about that girl you're seeing? - Sherri? I'm playing that slow.\\
76 - Really? Do you mean at a leisurely pace...\\
77 - ...or as if you were developmentally challenged?\\
78 - Oh, aren't you clever? Bite me.\\
79 - Alan, most beautiful women are used to guys...\\
80 - ...chasing after them. They expect it.\\
81 - Squeeze a little more ketchup on it, would you, buddy?\\
82 - However, if you hang back and stay cool...\\
83 - ...the women come to you.\\
84 - Well, not to you specifically, but you get the theory.\\
85 - Yeah, I'm not stupid. Just physically repellent...\\
86 - ...and inherently unlovable.\\
87 - Don't get snippy with me. I'm trying to teach you something.\\
88 - Hey, I agreed to one.\\
89 - If you're finished with dinner, get started on homework.\\
90 - I'm still hungry. He ate all my fries.\\
91 - You can have ice cream when you've done your homework.\\
92 - Isn't that procrastinating?\\
93 - Go.\\
94 - Man, that kid guards his plate like a one-armed inmate, doesn't he?\\
95 - Hello? Oh, hey, Sherri.\\
96 - How's it going?\\
97 - Tonight? No, I'm sorry, I can't. I've already got plans.\\
98 - How about tomorrow night? Oh, you've got plans.\\
99 - Okay. Well, Sunday?\\
100 - Monday?\\
101 - What about Tuesday? You know what?\\
102 - I'm looking at the wrong month in my date book. Tonight works.\\
103 - How about I pick you up at 8?\\
104 - Okay, I'll meet you at 7.\\
105 - How about Antonio's?\\
106 - The Oak Room it is.\\
107 - See you soon.\\
108 - - What just happened? - You were playing it slow.\\
109 - - Everything okay? - No, perfect, Stephan. Thanks.\\
110 - Always good to see you.\\
111 - I liked it too.\\
112 - So you must be a regular here.\\
113 - Yeah. Food's good and I bring a lot of clients.\\
114 - Speaking of which, it's getting kind of late.\\
115 - - I've got an early meeting tomorrow. - I'll get the check.\\
116 - I already took care of it.\\
117 - - When? - You were in the little boys' room.\\
118 - - That's not right. - It's fine. I asked you out. No big deal.\\
119 - No, you shouldn't call it "the little boys' room."\\
120 - - Sorry. - You're forgiven.\\
121 - So we can just go.\\
122 - If it's okay, I wanna go back to my place.\\
123 - Oh, great. I'll follow you.\\
124 - I don't think so, Charlie. I'm kind of tired.\\
125 - Okay. Well, how about this?\\
126 - I'll drive you home, carry you upstairs, tuck you into bed...\\
127 - ...kiss you good night, and just as you're drifting off to sleep...\\
128 - ...I will lick your body from head to toe.\\
129 - Lovely as that sounds, I'm gonna have to take a rain check.\\
130 - Okay. Yeah, I guess it is getting kind of late.\\
131 - - It's almost 9. - Thanks for understanding.\\
132 - - Sure. Hey, we're okay, right? - Yeah.\\
133 - - Did I say something to upset you? - No.\\
134 - - Are you mad at me? - No.\\
135 - - Promise? - Yes.\\
136 - Do I sound like a big old girl?\\
137 - Why didn't you do this part?\\
138 - That's extra credit. You don't have to do it.\\
139 - - Why don't you do it anyway? - Because I don't have to.\\
140 - It shows that you're willing to make an extra effort.\\
141 - But I'm not.\\
142 - - Do it anyway. - Why?\\
143 - If you spent as much time doing the work...\\
144 - ...as you do arguing about it, we'd be done.\\
145 - I am done. This is extra.\\
146 - - Hey. - Hey.\\
147 - You're home early.\\
148 - Alan, if you got something to say...\\
149 - ...why don't you just come out and say it?\\
150 - You're home early?\\
151 - Yeah, that's smart. Keep pushing me.\\
152 - - Did you see that? - Yeah, he took my ice cream.\\
153 - Hey, neighbor.\\
154 - Hi, Rose.\\
155 - - Didn't you have dessert with Sherri? - How did you know I was with Sherri?\\
156 - Oh, Charlie, you still don't get me, do you?\\
157 - - So do you wanna talk about it? - No.\\
158 - She probably just had to get up early, like she said.\\
159 - Probably.\\
160 - Unless her real date didn't start until later...\\
161 - ...and she just didn't wanna eat alone.\\
162 - What?\\
163 - Oh, come on, Charlie. Double-booking.\\
164 - You practically invented it.\\
165 - No, she wouldn't do that to me. Why would she do that to me?\\
166 - Did she do that to me? She did that to me, didn't she?\\
167 - - Excuse me? - Sorry.\\
168 - I was just taking a little selfish delight in your pain.\\
169 - The Germans call it "schadenfreude"...\\
170 - ...but here in the U.S.A., we just go:\\
171 - - Thanks. - Oh, Charlie...\\
172 - ...you don't need a girl like that. You could do so much better.\\
173 - You're right. I can.\\
174 - She doesn't call when she says she will.\\
175 - She won't let me sleep over. She's obviously seeing other guys.\\
176 - So why can't I get her out of my head?\\
177 - Okay, that's not where I was going, but let's review:\\
178 - She's gorgeous, but she's also self-centered...\\
179 - ...she's promiscuous, she's commitment-phobic...\\
180 - - Oh, my God. - What?\\
181 - I'm dating myself.\\
182 - No wonder the sex is so good.\\
183 - Trust me. You'll feel better having this done.\\
184 - - We'll have the weekend to have fun. - What if we don't have fun?\\
185 - Then all this studying will be for nothing.\\
186 - That's just a risk we'll have to take.\\
187 - Now, what year did Magellan circumnavigate the globe?\\
188 - - It's not gonna be on the test. - Maybe not.\\
189 - It wouldn't hurt for you to know it.\\
190 - Why would I wanna know something I don't have to?\\
191 - Because maybe you'll need to know it in the future.\\
192 - Well, then, that's when I'll learn it.\\
193 - Why can't you just learn it now?\\
194 - There's only so much space in my brain...\\
195 - ...that if you put Magellan in there, I might forget my locker combination.\\
196 - - Charlie, help me out here. - What?\\
197 - Jake doesn't think he needs to know anything about Magellan.\\
198 - What's Magellan?\\
199 - Okay, I'm out of here. Won't be late.\\
200 - Oh, I'm sorry. Bad news from the clinic?\\
201 - No. I'm just taking Sherri out for a nice dinner...\\
202 - ...after which I plan to gently but firmly...\\
203 - ...extricate myself from the relationship.\\
204 - So she got bad news from the clinic?\\
205 - There's no bad news. There's no clinic.\\
206 - - I'm just ending it. - Why?\\
207 - Because she's a self-centered, manipulative narcissist.\\
208 - So are you.\\
209 - Hello.\\
210 - He said "narcissist."\\
211 - It's not a dirty word.\\
212 - What does it mean?\\
213 - If you wanna know, look it up in the dictionary.\\
214 - Okay.\\
215 - He's not coming back.\\
216 - - Thank you, Steven. - It's "Stephan."\\
217 - Sure, it is.\\
218 - Listen, Sherri, we need to talk.\\
219 - - You're a terrific woman, but... - You look so hot tonight.\\
220 - Really?\\
221 - - That was incredible. - Yeah, it was, wasn't it?\\
222 - It's funny how things work out.\\
223 - An hour ago I wasn't feeling too good about us.\\
224 - I gotta get up early again tomorrow.\\
225 - So if you don't mind...\\
226 - There you go, Elvis. Peanut butter and bananas.\\
227 - - My mom cuts it diagonally. - Yeah?\\
228 - Well, that's the way I learned to cut it in prison.\\
229 - Thank you?\\
230 - Alan, got a riddle for you:\\
231 - What's short, picky and only supposed to be here on weekends?\\
232 - I'll give you a hint: it's your kid.\\
233 - I know. I know. His mother decided...\\
234 - ...she had to go to Palm Springs to rejuvenate herself.\\
235 - Detox?\\
236 - No, a health spa. Six hundred dollars a day...\\
237 - ...for meditation and colonics.\\
238 - How in the hell do you meditate...\\
239 - ...when someone's squirting water up your business?\\
240 - I don't think they happen simultaneously, Berta.\\
241 - That's good, because it could be very distracting.\\
242 - I can't even pee when the cat's watching me.\\
243 - Nobody answer the phone!\\
244 - Please, let it be her. Please, please, please.\\
245 - No, wait. Berta, you answer it.\\
246 - No, no, no! Let it ring.\\
247 - No, answer it.\\
248 - - Harper residence. - I'm not here.\\
249 - - Yeah, he's here. - Okay, I'm here.\\
250 - Jake, it's your mother!\\
251 - So how's it going down there? You struck oil yet?\\
252 - Charlie, what is going on with you?\\
253 - - What? - What do you mean, "what"?\\
254 - You're spending half your time drinking and moping.\\
255 - The other half sleeping and throwing up.\\
256 - You haven't been out of the house all week.\\
257 - You want me to go out like this in public?\\
258 - If you feel so strongly about this girl, why don't you just call her?\\
259 - Yeah, sure, I could call her.\\
260 - I could also FedEx her my testicles in a little silk bag.\\
261 - All the more reason to call first and give her a heads-up.\\
262 - Alan, don't you understand? This isn't about dating anymore.\\
263 - It's not even about sex. It's about self-respect and pride.\\
264 - Yeah, well, I think that ship has sailed, Charlie.\\
265 - See, the problem is she doesn't need me.\\
266 - So I need to figure out a way to show her...\\
267 - ...that I don't need her just as much as she doesn't need me.\\
268 - But without seeming needy.\\
269 - You see my dilemma?\\
270 - Actually, I think I do.\\
271 - You feel like I felt when Judith kicked me out.\\
272 - All right, if you're gonna mock me, this conversation's over.\\
273 - - Who took my sandwich? - Go do your homework.\\
274 - Unbelievable.\\
275 - - I'm glad you were free tonight. - I'm glad I was home when you called.\\
276 - I would've called sooner, but it's been a crazy week.\\
277 - It's okay. I understand.\\
278 - - Oh, Charlie, I want you. - Are you sure?\\
279 - - Oh, yeah. - How much?\\
280 - - Can't you tell? - I wanna hear it.\\
281 - I need you. I ache for you.\\
282 - Okay, then.\\
283 - - What are you doing? - I've gotta get home.\\
284 - I got an early meeting.\\
285 - - What? - Beat you to it this time, didn't I?\\
286 - What are you talk...? What kind of game are you playing here?\\
287 - The same game you're playing, only tonight, I win.\\
288 - Really? What is it that you're winning?\\
289 - Charlie, I'm lying here hungry for your body and you're walking away.\\
290 - So, what exactly is it that you're winning?\\
291 - You know.\\
292 - - Get out. - It's too late.\\
293 - You can't kick me out. I already said I'm leaving.\\
294 - Hey.\\
295 - - So how'd it go? - Great.\\
296 - I took control. I regained my self-respect.\\
297 - I walked out of there with my head held high.\\
298 - Good for you. Good for you. So you're done beating yourself up?\\
299 - Not quite.\\
300 - Jake, wait till we get inside.\\
301 - I'm hungry. Uncle Charlie's in there.\\
302 - I see your point.\\
303 - At the risk of asking a foolish question...\\
304 - ...you got any homework this weekend?\\
305 - - Nope. Did it at school. - Really?\\
306 - - Yup. Did it during detention. - Jake, why did you have detention?\\
307 - Because I didn't do my homework yesterday.\\
308 - So you did yesterday's homework and today's homework?\\
309 - Yup. The extra-credit section and everything.\\
310 - - Oh, great. I'll look it over. - Okay, I didn't do it.\\
311 - - Jake, why do you keep lying? - Because I thought you trusted me.\\
312 - The detention part was true.\\
313 - Hi, Charlie.\\
314 - Hey, Rose. What's going on?\\
315 - I just stopped by to say I'm sorry things didn't work out...\\
316 - ...with you and Sherri. - Yeah. Thanks.\\
317 - And I'm sorry for my schadenfreude the other day.\\
318 - I've been riddled with "glaukenschtuken" ever since.\\
319 - - Glauken...? - Schtuken.\\
320 - It means: " Feeling guilty for having felt schadenfreude."\\
321 - - They've got a word for that? - Not yet.\\
322 - But I'm hoping "glaukenschtuken" catches on.\\
323 - I'll do my part.\\
324 - You know, something good did come out of all this:\\
325 - Watching you obsess over Sherri...\\
326 - ...really helped me understand my obsession for you.\\
327 - I mean, you never return my calls. You always see other women.\\
328 - You never knowingly let me sleep over.\\
329 - And yet, I've never been able to get you out of my head.\\
330 - - Interesting. - Isn't it?\\
331 - But now that I understand it, I feel somehow free of it.\\
332 - Well, that's great, Rose. It sounds like a real healthy breakthrough.\\
333 - Yeah. And the best part is now that the fog of obsession has lifted...\\
334 - ...I can stop idealizing you, and see you for who you really are.\\
335 - And who would that be?\\
336 - An emotionally scarred and deeply flawed human being.\\
337 - Who will one day bless me...\\
338 - ...with emotionally scarred and deeply flawed children.\\
339 - Rose.\\
340 - Just hold me.\\
341 - I like the names Mike and Trudy.
\subsection {Episode 06: The Price of Healthy Gums is Eternal Vigilance}
1 - - So, dear... - What?\\
2 - Do you see anything you like?\\
3 - I don't know. What's venison?\\
4 - - Deer. - What?\\
5 - - Deer. - What?\\
6 - Deer. D-E-E-R.\\
7 - What? W-H-A-T.\\
8 - What's wrong with him?\\
9 - Jake, it's... It's the deer in the forest, like... Like Bambi.\\
10 - Oh, cool, let's eat Bambi.\\
11 - Coming soon to pay-per-view.\\
12 - Mom, wha...? What are you doing?\\
13 - - Nothing. - Oh, that's stealing.\\
14 - Hardly. I'm paying $ 12 for a martini.\\
15 - They're lucky I don't take a chair.\\
16 - - You're paying? - Figure of speech, Charles.\\
17 - Can I take this?\\
18 - - No. - Oh, come on.\\
19 - My precious.\\
20 - Put it down. We do not take things that don't belong to us.\\
21 - Listen who's taking the moral high ground, Mr. Five-Finger Discount.\\
22 - - What does that mean? - It doesn't mean anything.\\
23 - - How do you want your venison? - Does it come with antlers?\\
24 - Alan, there's no reason your son can't learn from your mistakes.\\
25 - I didn't make a mistake, Mom.\\
26 - Unbelievable. Twenty-five years later...\\
27 - ...and he still denies shoplifting.\\
28 - Oh, I get it. Five-finger discount. Cool.\\
29 - I did not shoplift, Jake. It was a misunderstanding.\\
30 - Alan, please.\\
31 - Walking around a toy store with your brother...\\
32 - ...and the Silly Putty just jumped in your pocket?\\
33 - Yes.\\
34 - Not much of a lie, Dad.\\
35 - Okay, everybody ready to order?\\
36 - Is that why you won't let me have Silly Putty?\\
37 - It's a stupid, pointless toy.\\
38 - But why'd you steal it?\\
39 - I didn't. The security guard must have planted it on me to make a bust.\\
40 - Oh, Alan.\\
41 - Who in their right mind would plant Silly Putty on a 9-year-old boy?\\
42 - Who, indeed?\\
43 - - Hey, Jake, you ever eaten snails? - Yeah, sure.\\
44 - I mean, in a restaurant.\\
45 - Oh, no.\\
46 - - You okay? - No. That deer didn't have antlers...\\
47 - ...when I ate it, but it's sure coming out that way.\\
48 - Well, you'll feel better tomorrow.\\
49 - We should sue that restaurant.\\
50 - Well, I'll get right on it. Come on.\\
51 - - Dad? - Yeah.\\
52 - Did you ever steal a car?\\
53 - I never stole anything.\\
54 - It's okay. You could tell me.\\
55 - I already know you got a rap sheet.\\
56 - For the last time, I did not take that Silly Putty.\\
57 - But the experience did teach me a very important lesson.\\
58 - And you know what that was?\\
59 - If you get caught, stick to your story, no matter how lame it is?\\
60 - - No, the lesson was... - Hang on, Dad.\\
61 - Okay, go ahead.\\
62 - The lesson was...\\
63 - Oh, God, Jake. That's... That's awful.\\
64 - Yeah, I wish I could have saved that one for school.\\
65 - - You too? - Yeah.\\
66 - Apparently Mom wasn't the only parasite at dinner tonight.\\
67 - Hey...\\
68 - ...how much do you remember about the whole Silly Putty incident?\\
69 - Oh, gee, not too much.\\
70 - I recall you crying when they dragged you into the store manager's office.\\
71 - Then I went and got a corn dog and an Orange Julius.\\
72 - Boy, those were good.\\
73 - - Remember those? - No, I mean...\\
74 - ...did you see me take the Silly Putty?\\
75 - Oh, no, no, I was nowhere near the Silly Putty.\\
76 - I think I was in the doll section, taking a peek under Barbie's dress.\\
77 - What a gyp that was.\\
78 - If Jake had been caught shoplifting and told me the story I told...\\
79 - ...there's no way I'd believe him.\\
80 - Well, let's just hope he doesn't get caught.\\
81 - - Can I tell you a little secret? - Okay.\\
82 - I always knew it wasn't the security guard.\\
83 - Really?\\
84 - There's only one rational explanation for how the Silly Putty got in my pants.\\
85 - And what would that be?\\
86 - That I actually stole it, but my mind couldn't deal with it.\\
87 - So somehow, I blocked it out.\\
88 - The human brain, huh? You gotta love it.\\
89 - That happens, right? You do something horrible...\\
90 - ...and wake up with no recollection? - Oh, yeah.\\
91 - And yet there she is, lying right next to you.\\
92 - You know, that day changed my life.\\
93 - I mean, ever since, I've had to be on guard against Bad Alan.\\
94 - I'm sorry, "Bad Alan"?\\
95 - Yeah, it's... It's what I call my potential for evildoing.\\
96 - - Oh, God. - It's why I've always worked so hard...\\
97 - ...to be a good son, a good student, a good person.\\
98 - And you've succeeded. You are good, good, good.\\
99 - Well, sure, I turned out great, but at what cost?\\
100 - I mean, do you have any clue how tightly wrapped I've had to be...\\
101 - ...to keep Bad Alan in check?\\
102 - I get glimpses.\\
103 - Well, I suppose I should count my blessings...\\
104 - ...that I was stopped. Who knows what kind of monster...\\
105 - ...I would've become if I hadn't been caught with the putty.\\
106 - But what if the security guard did plant it on you?\\
107 - That would mean there's no Bad Alan.\\
108 - That's true.\\
109 - But I can't afford to take that chance.\\
110 - None of us can.\\
111 - He's fine.\\
112 - Hey, Charlie.\\
113 - Hey, Rose.\\
114 - Looks like somebody needs a shoulder to cry on.\\
115 - No, thank you.\\
116 - Wanna just make out then?\\
117 - - Rose... - You're right. That was out of line.\\
118 - I deserve a spanking.\\
119 - Okay, what's up?\\
120 - - Can I trust you with something? - You trust me...\\
121 - ...with your bank account number.\\
122 - I never gave you my bank account number.\\
123 - Right, right. Go on.\\
124 - Have you ever done anything so wrong, so horrible...?\\
125 - Oh, yeah.\\
126 - - Let me finish. - I'm sorry.\\
127 - Something that seemed harmless at the time...\\
128 - ...yet somehow managed to mess up someone's entire life?\\
129 - Good question.\\
130 - I think it's too early to say. Go on.\\
131 - Well, I have.\\
132 - Twenty-five years ago, I put Silly Putty in my brother's pants.\\
133 - Well, if you left it in the egg, it should still be good.\\
134 - My point is, everybody thought he stole it...\\
135 - ...and I never told him the truth.\\
136 - Now you're wracked with guilt...\\
137 - ...and not sure whether a confession will make things better or worse.\\
138 - Yes, exactly.\\
139 - That's a sexy feeling, isn't it?\\
140 - Come on, Rose.\\
141 - You want my advice, Charlie?\\
142 - God help me, yes.\\
143 - Take your secret to the grave...\\
144 - ...but leave a manuscript explaining every questionable act...\\
145 - ...you've committed in a safety-deposit box...\\
146 - ...with instructions for it to be opened at your death...\\
147 - ...and read in front of all your friends, relatives and former lovers.\\
148 - I like it.\\
149 - Good.\\
150 - Now we can relax and enjoy the evening.\\
151 - Sing it with me, Charlie.\\
152 - Three, four, five, six, seven.\\
153 - - Are you decent? - Yeah.\\
154 - Three, four, five, six, seven.\\
155 - What's up?\\
156 - - Nothing. Just came in to say good night. - Three, four, five, six, seven.\\
157 - Why?\\
158 - Three, four, five, six, seven.\\
159 - Nothing. You just seemed stressed out before, and I was concerned.\\
160 - Oh, thanks. You're a... You're a good brother.\\
161 - Three, four, five, six, seven.\\
162 - You do that every night?\\
163 - Are you kidding? After every meal.\\
164 - Three, four, five, six, seven.\\
165 - You are tightly wrapped, aren't you?\\
166 - The price of healthy gums is eternal vigilance.\\
167 - Oh, God, I can't do this anymore.\\
168 - - Do what? - I have to tell you something.\\
169 - - Okay. - Come on out in the bedroom.\\
170 - All right.\\
171 - - What you doing? - You'll understand in a minute.\\
172 - - I thought you had to tell me something. - I do.\\
173 - There is no Bad Alan.\\
174 - I stole the Silly Putty...\\
175 - ...and put it in your pocket when you weren't looking.\\
176 - - Three, four, five, six, seven. - Damn you to hell!\\
177 - Come out here and die like a man!\\
178 - What do you know, there is a Bad Alan.\\
179 - Hey, Dad, when you got arrested for shoplifting, did they take you to jail?\\
180 - I did not get arrested, and there was no jail.\\
181 - So I guess you never had to shank a guy to get your props in the yard.\\
182 - You cracked the parental code on the cable box again.\\
183 - It's 1-2-3-4. A monkey could crack that.\\
184 - - Good morning. - Morning.\\
185 - Why are you walking like that?\\
186 - I spent the night in the bathroom.\\
187 - You too, huh?\\
188 - Tell Jake what you told me last night.\\
189 - Oh, okay. Sure.\\
190 - Jake, your father didn't steal the Silly Putty.\\
191 - - I did. - Really?\\
192 - Yeah, I stuck it in his pocket, so if anything happened...\\
193 - ...he'd be the one to get in trouble.\\
194 - What do you think now, Jake?\\
195 - I think Uncle Charlie's a genius.\\
196 - What? No, no. No genius. No, no.\\
197 - I mean, it's the perfect crime. How did you think of that?\\
198 - I don't know.\\
199 - I saw the putty. Your dad was wearing those dorky chinos with the big pockets.\\
200 - - And a light just went off in my head... - Charlie.\\
201 - A bad light. A bad, evil light. Because stealing is wrong...\\
202 - ...and letting somebody else take the blame for it is worse.\\
203 - Yeah, so Dad was like a decoy.\\
204 - Well, technically, the term is "mule."\\
205 - - Mule? Why? - Because he carries stuff.\\
206 - - Oh, of course... - Okay, okay.\\
207 - The important thing is, your father never stole in his life.\\
208 - And your Uncle Charlie is a thief and a coward.\\
209 - Yeah, but you're a mule.\\
210 - Are you happy? Go get dressed and washed.\\
211 - - Can we go to the mall? - Why do you wa...? No.\\
212 - I need to get a different mule.\\
213 - Okay, can we please get past this?\\
214 - No. No, we can't.\\
215 - I feel betrayed and hurt in ways that I can't even express.\\
216 - And you think we can just dance past that?\\
217 - I was hoping.\\
218 - Well, I am sorry, but it is not that easy.\\
219 - I mean, thanks to you, my... My life has been twisted beyond recognition.\\
220 - I mean, look at me, Charlie.\\
221 - I'm a... I'm a broke, hopelessly neurotic, middle-aged man...\\
222 - ...who doesn't know who he is or where he belongs.\\
223 - I have nothing, Charlie.\\
224 - - No... No wife, no home, nothing. - Okay.\\
225 - So should I check back with you after lunch?\\
226 - What do you want me to do?\\
227 - I said I was sorry. l... I confessed to Jake.\\
228 - And I doubt I got more than six, seven hours sleep last night.\\
229 - Nothing you can do. The damage has been done.\\
230 - - It can't be undone. - Come on, I'm your brother.\\
231 - - You're gonna forgive. You always do. - No, no, this is different.\\
232 - - This is the worst thing you've ever done. - No, it's not.\\
233 - What do you mean?\\
234 - Just making conversation.\\
235 - - Hey, Mom. - Charlie, what are you doing here?\\
236 - - In the neighborhood. Thought I'd visit. - Why?\\
237 - - I don't know. I'm your son. - And...?\\
238 - - And I was hoping we could talk. - About?\\
239 - May I please just come in?\\
240 - Are you fleeing from the law?\\
241 - - I'm not fleeing from anyone, Mom. - Well, keep it in mind.\\
242 - No one would ever think to look for you at your mother's house.\\
243 - - I get your point. I don't visit enough. - You don't visit at all.\\
244 - And I'm riddled with guilt.\\
245 - Oh, you're just saying that to make me feel better.\\
246 - So, what's up?\\
247 - You know how the other night at dinner...\\
248 - ...we were talking about the Silly Putty deal?\\
249 - Did that venison disagree with you?\\
250 - Yeah, that's not what I came to talk about.\\
251 - I've got a good mind to sue that restaurant.\\
252 - - Yeah, anyway, about the Silly Putty... - What about it?\\
253 - Alan didn't steal it. I did.\\
254 - I put it in his pocket.\\
255 - You framed your baby brother?\\
256 - How could you?\\
257 - I know, I know. It was a rotten thing to do.\\
258 - Rotten? It's unspeakable.\\
259 - Do you have any idea what you put me through?\\
260 - - You? - First the embarrassment...\\
261 - ...of people thinking that I'd spawned a petty thief.\\
262 - Then all the trouble I went to trying to figure out clever ways...\\
263 - ...to hide my jewelry from his sticky little fingers.\\
264 - - That's really not what l... - Not to mention the hundreds of hours...\\
265 - ...spent driving him to therapy with that creepy Dr. Demerest...\\
266 - ...while I could have been... I don't know, doing something fun.\\
267 - Okay, yeah, it was a real imposition on you...\\
268 - ...and as it turns out, it had kind of a negative impact on Alan too.\\
269 - Alan? Oh, yes, of course.\\
270 - You know, there was no insurance for kleptomania therapy in those days.\\
271 - It was all out of pocket.\\
272 - Yeah, but about Alan...\\
273 - ...I was hoping you might have insight as to how I could get him to forgive me.\\
274 - Why ask me?\\
275 - You know, I'm starting to wonder that myself.\\
276 - I guess it's because he still loves you...\\
277 - ...despite all the lousy stuff you did to him.\\
278 - I beg your pardon? I was a wonderful mother.\\
279 - And if Alan thinks otherwise...\\
280 - ...it's only because that walleyed Dr. Demerest put ideas into his head.\\
281 - Well, that was money well spent.\\
282 - Okay, then.\\
283 - I didn't need a reason to drink tonight, but it's nice to know I've got one.\\
284 - Hey, Charlie, wait.\\
285 - - What? - Have you forgotten why you came here?\\
286 - You want forgiveness, right?\\
287 - - Yes. - Well...\\
288 - ...I forgive you.\\
289 - But next time, call first.\\
290 - Would you pass the salt?\\
291 - Could you get me the salt?\\
292 - - Dad, salt. - Sure.\\
293 - - Here. - Thanks.\\
294 - Oh, would you give me the ketchup, please?\\
295 - Here. Here's the ketchup.\\
296 - Thank you.\\
297 - - Dad? - Yeah.\\
298 - If Uncle Charlie let you kick him in the nuts...\\
299 - ...would that make you guys even?\\
300 - No.\\
301 - Boy, he's really mad at you.\\
302 - Relax, Jake. We're just having a little communication problem.\\
303 - That's what Dad said right before Mom threw him out.\\
304 - Nobody threw me out.\\
305 - Your mother and I mutually decided that we weren't compatible.\\
306 - You don't seem compatible with Uncle Charlie right now.\\
307 - - Well, it's not my fault. - Was it your fault with Mom?\\
308 - No.\\
309 - You know, Dad, maybe you're the one who's not compatible.\\
310 - If you're done with dinner, do your homework.\\
311 - Fine, kill the messenger.\\
312 - - Oh, come on, Alan. Talk to me. - No.\\
313 - Look, I wanna make this right, but you gotta help me.\\
314 - Please, tell me what I can do. I'm begging for your forgiveness.\\
315 - I am sorry, but you did something...\\
316 - ...which affected my life in a deeply destructive way and...\\
317 - l... I don't think I have it in me to forgive you.\\
318 - - Hello? Anybody home? - In here, Mom.\\
319 - Well, how are my boys doing this evening?\\
320 - Well, I think Mommy has the answer. Alan...\\
321 - ...if you find it intolerable living under the same roof...\\
322 - ...with the brother who betrayed you...\\
323 - ...then you and Jake can come and live with me.\\
324 - We're good.\\
325 - Hey, Charlie, a couple of days ago...\\
326 - ...you said the Silly Putty wasn't the worst thing you ever did to me.\\
327 - It's ancient history. Let it go.\\
328 - I know, I know. It's just... I'm curious.\\
329 - What else have you done to me that I didn't know about?\\
330 - - It's not important. - Yes, it is.\\
331 - The truth about the shoplifting incident...\\
332 - ...it's allowed me to reevaluate who I am...\\
333 - ...and... And feel better about myself.\\
334 - - Well, that's great. - Yeah.\\
335 - I feel a lot better since I confessed.\\
336 - Good, good. So let's keep going with this.\\
337 - Okay, but you gotta promise that no matter what I tell you, all is forgiven.\\
338 - Oh, absolutely, absolutely.\\
339 - You're probably gonna laugh.\\
340 - - I'm sure I will. Tell me. - Well...\\
341 - ...remember how you were a bed wetter till you were 8?\\
342 - Yeah.\\
343 - You actually stopped at 6.\\
344 - Wha...? What...? What did you do? Did you sneak into my room and...?\\
345 - And...? And pour warm water on me while I was asleep?\\
346 - Yeah, okay, let's say it was water, and let's say I poured it.\\
347 - Well, I feel better. How about you?
\subsection {Episode 07: A Kosher Slaughterhouse Out in Fontana}
1 - - Hey, look who's here. - Hey, Dad.\\
2 - Aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye?\\
3 - Apparently not.\\
4 - Do you see how rude he is to me?\\
5 - It's terrible. I'll talk to him.\\
6 - - I wish you would because... Wait, Alan! - Oh, oh, sorry.\\
7 - Alan, have you been badmouthing me?\\
8 - - Badmouthing you? To whom? - To Jake.\\
9 - Oh, to Jake. No.\\
10 - - Why? - His attitude towards me is disrespectful.\\
11 - I have to wonder where he's getting it from.\\
12 - I assure you, I make it a point to speak well of you in front of our son.\\
13 - What about your brother?\\
14 - Oh, with Charlie, I'm completely honest.\\
15 - That is not what I meant.\\
16 - I know.\\
17 - Hey, Judith.\\
18 - Have you said derogatory things about me to Jake?\\
19 - No, why? Did you want me to?\\
20 - I don't understand his behavior.\\
21 - Ignoring me, avoiding me, acting like I'm the enemy.\\
22 - But you get why I'm doing it, right?\\
23 - I got it!\\
24 - I don't know what to say. He's not getting it from us.\\
25 - - Absolutely not. - It's your mother!\\
26 - - You talk to her. - No, I talked last time.\\
27 - - Choose you for it. - Odds.\\
28 - One, two, three, shoot.\\
29 - - Odds. You talk to her. - No.\\
30 - - Hey, but you said you were gonna... - I lied.\\
31 - Leave a message at the beep. Beep!\\
32 - I wish there were a better way to deal with Mom.\\
33 - There is, but we're both too pretty for jail.\\
34 - - What? - What?\\
35 - Mom's here.\\
36 - Charlie, did you hear me?\\
37 - Yeah, I just prefer to live in denial.\\
38 - Come on.\\
39 - We talked about this. We need to set an example.\\
40 - Fine, tell Mom I love her and... I don't wanna give her my cold.\\
41 - That is not going to help.\\
42 - Well, you gotta say it in front of Jake.\\
43 - No. Here is the plan.\\
44 - We'll stop acting like we hate being with her...\\
45 - ...stop taking shots at her, and start acting like we love and respect her.\\
46 - - All at once? - Come on.\\
47 - Your Uncle Charlie thinks I don't see him...\\
48 - ...but Grandmommy sees everything.\\
49 - Mom, we didn't expect to see you today.\\
50 - I have to come unannounced because when I call first...\\
51 - ...there's no one home when I get here.\\
52 - I imagine that's only because my cowardly sons are trying to avoid me.\\
53 - She's ruining the plan.\\
54 - Well, the important thing is we're all here, and we're happy to see you.\\
55 - - Right, Charlie? - Oh, happy isn't the word.\\
56 - - So, what's new, Mom? - Well, if you really care...\\
57 - - We do, we do. - We do.\\
58 - Next Sunday, I am receiving my gold blazer...\\
59 - ...from the Westside Realtor's Association.\\
60 - - I am so proud of you. - That's great.\\
61 - Me too, Mom.\\
62 - It's the highest honor the real-estate community can bestow.\\
63 - - I am so proud of you. - That's great.\\
64 - Me too, Mom.\\
65 - So I wanted to talk to you about the presentation ceremony.\\
66 - We'll be there. Tell us where and when.\\
67 - Well, next Sunday, 5:00. And I was hoping we could have it here.\\
68 - - Here? - Why here?\\
69 - - I mean, we love and respect you... - But why here?\\
70 - This isn't really a good house for parties.\\
71 - - Yeah, it's so big and close to the ocean. - Yeah.\\
72 - Come on. I can't very well throw a party for myself.\\
73 - This way everyone will get to see how much my sons love and respect me.\\
74 - Anyway, here is the guest list, and also a suggested menu.\\
75 - Nothing fancy. Cocktails, buffet.\\
76 - Any questions?\\
77 - - No. - Good.\\
78 - Okay.\\
79 - Big kiss. Love you all.\\
80 - - Love you too, Mom. - Bye, Grandma.\\
81 - Relatives, huh?\\
82 - Can't live with them, can't turn them in for the reward.\\
83 - Excuse me, Berta, but we happen to love our mother very much.\\
84 - - Right, Charlie? - Right.\\
85 - Jake, look. There's a pelican on the deck.\\
86 - Oh, cool.\\
87 - Are you happy?\\
88 - Now we have to throw a party for your crazy-ass mother.\\
89 - - She's your mother too. - How do you know?\\
90 - - I could've been adopted. - You wish.\\
91 - I do. Now, what about this stupid party?\\
92 - Here. Maybe this'll help.\\
93 - "Daisy's Fishing Tackle and Live Bait"?\\
94 - Turn it over.\\
95 - "Daisy's Classy Catering."\\
96 - She's my sister. Her husband left. I'm trying to get her back on her feet.\\
97 - She runs a catering business and a bait shop?\\
98 - Not at the same time.\\
99 - There's no pelican.\\
100 - Hey, you Charlie?\\
101 - Maybe.\\
102 - - Who's asking? - I'm Daisy, the caterer.\\
103 - Your Berta's sister?\\
104 - Same mom. Dad's a little iffy.\\
105 - Berta said if I wanted a shot of your bourbon, I had to ask you.\\
106 - - Yeah, sure. Knock yourself out. - Thanks.\\
107 - I don't usually drink before noon, but I'm going through a rough patch.\\
108 - Well, that's why they make bourbon.\\
109 - My husband left me for another woman. You know how I found out?\\
110 - - To tell you the truth... - Relax. It's rhetorical.\\
111 - They waved to me as they drove my house out of the trailer park.\\
112 - - That's sad. - Yeah.\\
113 - I had that doublewide 11 years.\\
114 - Larry was with me for four.\\
115 - Six months of those were house arrest, so you can't give him credit for that.\\
116 - You know, I haven't gotten up to pee yet.\\
117 - Let me tell you something.\\
118 - Larry was nothing when I met him.\\
119 - He was working at some kosher slaughterhouse out in Fontana...\\
120 - ...before they fired him for being mean to the cattle.\\
121 - What?\\
122 - The Jewish laws dictate that the animals have to be treated kindly...\\
123 - ...before they get whacked.\\
124 - Larry would taunt them.\\
125 - "Hey, hamburger, guess what's gonna happen to you."\\
126 - Anyway, I picked him up off his sorry, unemployed ass.\\
127 - I gave him hair plugs, contact lenses, teeth.\\
128 - The bastard dumped me for this tiny, little Korean manicurist...\\
129 - ...who huffs nail-polish remover between appointments.\\
130 - Well, you give a guy hair and teeth, he's bound to hook up with trash.\\
131 - No, she was pretty hot.\\
132 - She had a spray-on tan, Botox up the yin-yang.\\
133 - Couldn't tell if she was 20 or 60.\\
134 - - Daisy! - In here!\\
135 - What the hell are you doing?\\
136 - Relax. It's not what you think. We're just having a drink.\\
137 - Good idea.\\
138 - You listen to me. Just because I got us this job...\\
139 - ...doesn't mean I'm cooking by myself.\\
140 - I'm coming down there.\\
141 - And don't act like you're doing me some big favor.\\
142 - Oh, excuse me for trying to help my broke, homeless, baby sister.\\
143 - I'm not homeless. I have a home. I just don't know where it's parked.\\
144 - I wouldn't be broke if you'd have paid me my share of Mama's estate.\\
145 - What estate? It was a shoebox...\\
146 - ...full of corn pads, used lottery tickets and insulin.\\
147 - It's the first I'm hearing about the insulin.\\
148 - Excuse me, but shouldn't we be, you know...\\
149 - ...cooking something for my mother's party?\\
150 - Hang on, Charlie.\\
151 - You know, I am sick of you insinuating that I stole all that crap Mama left me.\\
152 - She didn't leave it to you. You were just the first one back after she flatlined.\\
153 - Oh, and where were you? At some ashram in Oregon?\\
154 - I was learning from my guru how to channel my spirit guide.\\
155 - Oh, please. You were humping a defrocked priest in the woods.\\
156 - How about stuffed mushrooms? Everybody loves those.\\
157 - You know, that's your problem your whole life.\\
158 - You chase after losers, take care of them, fix them up...\\
159 - ...and then they hop on the first manicurist out of town.\\
160 - You're jealous because I've had love in my life.\\
161 - Yeah? You know what you got in your life now? Squat.\\
162 - No husband, no one to do your nails, and blocks where your house used to be.\\
163 - I swear to God. One more word and I'm gonna knock you on your keister!\\
164 - - Okay, okay, there's no reason... - Squat!\\
165 - - That's it! - Whoa, whoa, no!\\
166 - No, whoa! Stop! Berta!\\
167 - Berta!\\
168 - Give me the rolling pin.\\
169 - Is there a special place you'd like me to put it?\\
170 - I don't know what else you want from me. I took you in.\\
171 - Gunther's in the garage, so you can have the couch.\\
172 - You spoil that dog. Anyway, I'm staying at a motel tonight.\\
173 - Good idea. Maybe you'll meet your next husband on the walk there.\\
174 - - Can I have one of these? - No.\\
175 - I am just trying to be a good sister.\\
176 - No, you're trying to make me feel like crap.\\
177 - It's what you always do.\\
178 - - So I can eat this? - No.\\
179 - - Let him have one. - You don't know this kid.\\
180 - He never stops at one. He eats like a refugee.\\
181 - - Eat it. - Drop it.\\
182 - Hey, how's it going?\\
183 - Not good.\\
184 - Nice move, Tinkerbell.\\
185 - - Shut your hole and help me pick this up. - You pick it up.\\
186 - I'm going outside to meditate.\\
187 - - What's going on? - I'll tell you what's going on.\\
188 - You wanted that clown to be nice to his mother.\\
189 - But did you think to say to him, "Clown, be nice to your mother"?\\
190 - No, we had to throw a big party for our mother...\\
191 - ...catered by the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.\\
192 - That's it. I can't work like this.\\
193 - Well, you have to, Berta.\\
194 - We've got 50 people coming in a couple of hours.\\
195 - - Don't tell me. Tell her. - Fine.\\
196 - Watch this.\\
197 - Hey! I'm meditating here!\\
198 - Jake, let's go pick up Grandma.\\
199 - - Charlie, you're in charge. - The hell I am.\\
200 - - Why pick her up? - Grandma likes to drink.\\
201 - - When grownups drink, they don't drive. - Good thing Uncle Charlie lives here.\\
202 - So, good luck. I'll see you tomorrow.\\
203 - No, wait. Berta, you can't leave.\\
204 - Don't worry. Your deposit's fully refundable in fishing tackle or live bait.\\
205 - I don't want a refund.\\
206 - I want you to make up with Daisy...\\
207 - ...so when my mother gets here, she'll have something to eat besides my soul.\\
208 - Make up with her? For what? Trying to help her?\\
209 - Trying to keep her from making the same stupid mistake again?\\
210 - Yeah, sure, fine, whatever. Just do it!\\
211 - No, I'm done with her. I quit.\\
212 - Berta... Berta, you can't quit being related to somebody.\\
213 - Believe me, I've tried.\\
214 - She is a spoiled, little princess...\\
215 - ...who doesn't know when somebody's trying to help.\\
216 - - And you know what else? - Hold on, hold on.\\
217 - I'm still trying to wrap my brain around "little princess."\\
218 - Ever since Mom spit her out, she got everything she wanted.\\
219 - "We don't need to fix Berta's teeth, Daisy needs singing lessons."\\
220 - "Why spend money on a prom dress for Berta...\\
221 - ...when Daisy needs tap shoes?" - That's rough, but...\\
222 - "Who cares if Berta needs her spine straightened?"\\
223 - "Daisy wants a nose job!"\\
224 - What if you went ahead and made a couple dozen of those little egg rolls?\\
225 - "So what if Berta's got an extra big toe?"\\
226 - - Mom? - Oh, hello, boys.\\
227 - Why aren't you dressed? We came to pick you up.\\
228 - So you can drink.\\
229 - Oh, yes, well, I've decided to pass on the party.\\
230 - What? You can't pass.\\
231 - We've got people coming, decorations, caterers.\\
232 - And that's how you're dressed?\\
233 - Beats the hell out of a bathrobe.\\
234 - - Why don't you wanna go to your party? - Please, it isn't a party.\\
235 - It's a sham. None of those people are my friends.\\
236 - Why would you think that?\\
237 - Believe it or not, Alan, your mother is a very sensitive woman...\\
238 - ...and I can feel when people around me know that I hate them.\\
239 - Why did you want us to throw the party?\\
240 - Oh, why does anyone want a party?\\
241 - To feel superior while feigning humility.\\
242 - Don't touch that, Jake.\\
243 - Let me tell you something.\\
244 - The way you treat people is the way they treat you back.\\
245 - Miserable bastards.\\
246 - But putting that aside, you're getting a gold jacket today...\\
247 - ...and we wanted to share that with you.\\
248 - Is that what it takes? I have to win an award for my sons to notice I'm alive?\\
249 - Okay, you know what? Go, don't go. I don't care.\\
250 - If you wanna sit here and stew in the venom and bile...\\
251 - ...that is the soup of your being, then fine. I hope you drown in it.\\
252 - Don't you ever talk to your mother this way.\\
253 - Forget the party. I'll go back and tell those people...\\
254 - ...that the guest of honor could not be bothered to show up.\\
255 - - Come on, Jake. - Oh, dear Lord.\\
256 - Alan, wait.\\
257 - If this silly, little party means that much to you, I'll go.\\
258 - Just let me get dressed.\\
259 - Oh, gee. Thanks, Mom.\\
260 - God, I hate being guilted into doing things.\\
261 - And after all that, the loans, the bail, the kidney I gave her...\\
262 - ...which even though it wasn't mine, was still money out of pocket...\\
263 - ...did she appreciate my sacrifices?\\
264 - I'm guessing no.\\
265 - She threw them away on chasing after men with drinking problems...\\
266 - ...men with gambling problems, men with wooden legs and glass eyes.\\
267 - You wanna know why?\\
268 - Spare parts?\\
269 - Low self-esteem.\\
270 - I remember when we were little girls...\\
271 - ...she had this crush on our cousin Jimmy...\\
272 - - He wasn't really our cousin. He was... - Stop, please! Enough.\\
273 - If you won't talk to her, I will.\\
274 - Finally. I was running out of stories.\\
275 - Daisy?\\
276 - Can I talk to you for a minute?\\
277 - Daisy is no longer inhabiting this earthly vessel.\\
278 - Excuse me?\\
279 - I am Oxyquatzal, warrior priestess of the Aztec people.\\
280 - Okay.\\
281 - Let me ask you something.\\
282 - Do you know how to make those little hot dogs wrapped in pastry?\\
283 - Listen carefully. I have a message for Daisy.\\
284 - - Really? - She's wandered off the path of destiny.\\
285 - She must return.\\
286 - Alrighty, is there a number where she can reach you?\\
287 - Tell her to follow her bliss...\\
288 - ...to stop squandering the gifts of the Great Spirit.\\
289 - - Got it. - Do you need to write that down?\\
290 - No, I got it. Path, bliss, spirit.\\
291 - - Great Spirit. - Sorry. "Great Spirit."\\
292 - - Anything else? - No, that's it.\\
293 - - What do you want? - You're screwing with me, right?\\
294 - Get out of here. I'm trying to channel my spirit guide.\\
295 - OxyContin?\\
296 - Oxyquatzal. How do you know about her?\\
297 - Oh, boy.\\
298 - Berta!\\
299 - Was Oxyquatzal here? What did she say?\\
300 - She said that the guests are gonna be here soon...\\
301 - ...so you should make up with your sister and finish cooking.\\
302 - No, she didn't.\\
303 - How do you know?\\
304 - Oxyquatzal is a 500-year-old Aztec warrior.\\
305 - Do you think she really cares about your dumb-ass party?\\
306 - Everybody likes a party.\\
307 - What did she really say, Chachi?\\
308 - She said that you have strayed from your path and to follow your bliss...\\
309 - ...which is catering, right? - No, I never liked catering.\\
310 - I only got into it because the bait business was so damn competitive.\\
311 - What else?\\
312 - Something about squandering the gifts of the Great Spirit.\\
313 - Oh, man, that is heavy.\\
314 - For an ancient chick, she is so spot on.\\
315 - Well, no sense crying over squandered gifts.\\
316 - What do you say we go to the kitchen?\\
317 - What's the point? My life is hopeless. My dreams are dead.\\
318 - Yeah, but what if they weren't?\\
319 - - What do you mean? - Oh, I don't know.\\
320 - What if there was some way I could help you?\\
321 - You think you could whip up some rumaki then?\\
322 - You don't even know what my dreams are.\\
323 - Oh, come on. Work with me, baby. I don't even know what rumaki is!\\
324 - Oh, gosh, Alan, I don't know about this.\\
325 - - Is my hair all right? - Mom, your hair looks perfect.\\
326 - You're impeccably dressed, you're fashionably late...\\
327 - ...and everybody is waiting for you.\\
328 - So, now, come on, let's walk in there and rub their noses in your success.\\
329 - Well, all right.\\
330 - - Alan. - What?\\
331 - You're blocking me.\\
332 - Rumaki?\\
333 - I will never, ever forgive you for this.\\
334 - One thing. One lousy thing I ask from my sons, and this is what I get.\\
335 - - Sorry. - Sorry.\\
336 - Not only was I roundly ignored at my own party...\\
337 - ...but I listened to a disturbed caterer belt out...\\
338 - ...the entire score of La Cage aux Folles.\\
339 - - Sorry. - Sorry.\\
340 - You should be sorry.\\
341 - We are.\\
342 - Then say it.\\
343 - - Sorry. - Sorry.\\
344 - Hello?\\
345 - Jake, honey, ready to go home?\\
346 - Mom, you're here. I love you.\\
347 - Wonderful. Teach him sarcasm. Thank you very much.\\
348 - - Sorry. - Sorry.
\subsection {Episode 08: Frankenstein and the Horny Villagers}
1 - - Hey, how do I look? - Incredible.\\
2 - All men want to be you, all women want to be with you.\\
3 - Could you at least look at me before you answer?\\
4 - I stand corrected.\\
5 - All men want to be with you...\\
6 - Charlie, come on. I'm really nervous here.\\
7 - This is my first real date since college.\\
8 - - What the hell is this? - Bourbon.\\
9 - - You drink bourbon while you work out? - Gin makes me sweat.\\
10 - Look, don't turn this into a bigger deal than it needs to be.\\
11 - - You met a woman, you asked her out... - Technically, she asked me out.\\
12 - See, I was in the market, and she needed advice on picking out corn.\\
13 - There were no employees around. There never are.\\
14 - Even if they are, they're not knowledgeable about produce.\\
15 - - Thank God you were there. - Tell me about it.\\
16 - I explained that you have to husk a few ears...\\
17 - ...to check the firmness of the kernels.\\
18 - Next thing you know, she asked me out.\\
19 - Well, I guess that's why they say no one gets more action than a greengrocer.\\
20 - - They say that? - No.\\
21 - The point is, it's just dinner.\\
22 - You'll go, you'll bore her to death, you'll come home.\\
23 - Yeah, I know, but I wanna look good while I'm doing it.\\
24 - You look fine. Just relax. Be yourself.\\
25 - Yeah. Yeah. Okay.\\
26 - - You think I should bring some condoms? - Why?\\
27 - Well, I see the public service commercials...\\
28 - Yeah, you're right. See you later.\\
29 - Feel the burn.\\
30 - I think it's going well.\\
31 - My God, Alan. You're like a machine.\\
32 - I'm a love shark, baby. If I stop making love, I drown.\\
33 - Okay, okay, okay. Wait a sec, wait a sec:\\
34 - Sharks don't growl.\\
35 - All right, I'm a love bear.\\
36 - If I stop making love, I prevent forest fires.\\
37 - Jeez.\\
38 - - Alan. - Put that out.\\
39 - - Morning. - Morning.\\
40 - I see you've been working out again.\\
41 - Yeah, well, it's good for my heart.\\
42 - I figure the liver damage makes it kind of a push.\\
43 - Morning, all.\\
44 - - Morning. - Morning.\\
45 - Thirsty.\\
46 - Alan.\\
47 - Well, gadzooks, Zippy's getting his freak on.\\
48 - Yeah, it seems we're living in an age of miracles.\\
49 - I guess if they can put a man on the moon...\\
50 - ...they can put a woman on your brother.\\
51 - - Who's the girl? - I don't know.\\
52 - He met her at the supermarket. Helped her pick out corn.\\
53 - Corn?\\
54 - Well, I'm not in any position to judge. I once did a guy for a tank of gas.\\
55 - - Hey, Alan? Alan? - Yeah?\\
56 - - What you got there? - Basting brush...\\
57 - ...chocolate sauce, rubber gloves. You know what we're gonna use them for?\\
58 - - No. - Neither do I.\\
59 - Charlie, I have never had sex like this before in my life.\\
60 - In fact, I don't think anything I've had prior to this can even be called sex.\\
61 - Because if you call that sex, we need a new name for this.\\
62 - My suggestion would be "hootenanny yum-yum."\\
63 - I'm happy for you.\\
64 - Me too. Oh, do we have a step stool?\\
65 - - Hallway closet. - Thank you.\\
66 - - You might wanna pace yourself. - Yeah, right.\\
67 - Oh, boy.\\
68 - - What? - Oh, boy.\\
69 - Can I watch TV?\\
70 - I don't see why not. You got eyes and a butt.\\
71 - Where's Alan?\\
72 - - He's here. - Well, may I speak with him?\\
73 - Sure, why not.\\
74 - Okay, okay. Wait a sec.\\
75 - - Ta-da! - Yes!\\
76 - Not a good time, Charlie.\\
77 - Well, I thought you might like to know that your ex-wife and son are here.\\
78 - She's supposed to bring him on Friday.\\
79 - It is Friday.\\
80 - But not until 5.\\
81 - It is 5.\\
82 - Okay, cover for me. I'll be right out.\\
83 - - Alan. - Yeah?\\
84 - You might wanna take off the rubber glove first.\\
85 - Good thinking.\\
86 - - He'll be right out. - Thank you.\\
87 - So...\\
88 - ...how are you?\\
89 - What's going on in there?\\
90 - Alan's moving furniture around, because he's constantly redecorating.\\
91 - Sorry, I was taking a nap.\\
92 - So... So, what's up?\\
93 - I wanted to remind you that Jake has his karate tournament tomorrow morning.\\
94 - - Okay. - What's that on your face?\\
95 - - Just a little chocolate sauce. - Thank you.\\
96 - Got it, karate tournament, tomorrow morning.\\
97 - Alan, what's going on?\\
98 - What's... What's going on is I was lying in bed...\\
99 - ...eating a sundae.\\
100 - - After moving furniture. - After moving furniture.\\
101 - And I fell asleep in some chocolate sauce.\\
102 - Goodbye, Alan.\\
103 - - I think she bought it. - You think?\\
104 - No.\\
105 - Why didn't you tell her you've got a woman?\\
106 - I don't know. It just seems wrong.\\
107 - You're divorced. You have nothing to feel guilty about.\\
108 - It's not guilt. It's more shame.\\
109 - - What are you ashamed of? - Charlie, I spent 12 years with Judith.\\
110 - We went through a lot together. You can't just erase all that...\\
111 - ...by lapping chocolate sauce out of another woman's navel.\\
112 - Okay, my fault for asking. Now, what do you wanna do about Jake?\\
113 - Oh, my God, Jake's here. I don't want him to know I'm dating.\\
114 - This is not dating, Alan. This is rubber gloves and step stools.\\
115 - All right, all right.\\
116 - You distract him, and I'll sneak Nancy out and drive her home.\\
117 - - Fine. - Okay.\\
118 - Wrong. This is just wrong, so wrong.\\
119 - Hey, Jake, wanna go shoot some hoops?\\
120 - In a minute.\\
121 - He's oblivious. Just go.\\
122 - In a minute.\\
123 - No, he's still watching TV. Hold on, I'll check.\\
124 - - You hungry? - What are we having?\\
125 - - I don't know. Tell me if you're hungry. - That depends on what we're having.\\
126 - - Okay, what do you want? - What do you got?\\
127 - He's not hungry.\\
128 - So I thought you were taking her home and coming right back.\\
129 - You checked into a hotel?\\
130 - No, you're right, driving that way is dangerous.\\
131 - One pothole can change your life forever.\\
132 - When's the last time you ate something? Quit giggling, you know what I mean.\\
133 - Okay. Okay, look in the honor bar for some Gatorade or something.\\
134 - Dehydration is the enemy.\\
135 - All right, have fun. See you later.\\
136 - I am hungry. What's for dinner?\\
137 - - What do you want? - What do you got?\\
138 - I think there's a couple of steaks in the freezer.\\
139 - I want chicken.\\
140 - It's just wrong.\\
141 - So very, very wrong.\\
142 - - You full? - Yeah.\\
143 - - Good. - Why, what else we got?\\
144 - - You said you were full. - I am.\\
145 - Good.\\
146 - But what else we got?\\
147 - Sorry, I'm late. I had to go to the office...\\
148 - ...for an emergency, and I got a flat tire.\\
149 - And so I had to wait for the auto club to come and change it.\\
150 - And I didn't have my card.\\
151 - And the guy had to check me on the computer...\\
152 - ...even though I've been a member since 1989.\\
153 - And that's why it took until now for me to get back.\\
154 - Thought you were here.\\
155 - I missed you, Alan.\\
156 - Thank you. Can I speak with you for a minute?\\
157 - - Hey, Uncle Charlie, what's for dessert? - You said were full.\\
158 - Not for dessert.\\
159 - - Okay, what do you want? - What do you got?\\
160 - How do you not kill him?\\
161 - Charlie, I feel horrible about what I'm doing.\\
162 - Then you're doing it wrong.\\
163 - No, I feel like I'm abandoning my child.\\
164 - Weren't you listening? He didn't even notice you were gone.\\
165 - That's not the point.\\
166 - What kind of man chooses sex with an insatiably hot stranger...\\
167 - ...over quality time with his little boy?\\
168 - I don't know, a man who was married for 12 years and had sex 12 times.\\
169 - You're right, I deserve this.\\
170 - Exactly, so go enjoy yourself.\\
171 - Well, I do have the room the whole night.\\
172 - Yeah, most of your better hotels prefer you do it that way.\\
173 - Just make sure Jake goes to bed early. He's got karate in the morning.\\
174 - - Which, of course, you'll be back for. - Charlie, trust me.\\
175 - You, I trust. It's him I'm worried about.\\
176 - What?\\
177 - Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. I have to take him to karate?\\
178 - Alan, it's 6:30 in the morning.\\
179 - What kind of maniac broad did you hook up with?\\
180 - She's incredible, Charlie. I've never met anyone like her.\\
181 - Gotta go.\\
182 - Jake, wake up.\\
183 - Well, I tried.\\
184 - - Anybody home? - Right here.\\
185 - Where's Jake?\\
186 - I don't know. Didn't he have a karate tournament?\\
187 - Yes. You were supposed to take him three hours ago.\\
188 - - Why didn't you take him? - He wouldn't get up.\\
189 - I tried everything.\\
190 - What time did he go to bed?\\
191 - I don't know. I crashed around 2 and he was still going strong.\\
192 - He was up past 2?\\
193 - He said he's had coffee before, but that was a lie, right?\\
194 - Okay, okay, all right, it's not important. The karate was his mother's idea. Listen.\\
195 - I need to ask you for another favor.\\
196 - Oh, come on, put it in the holster, Wild Bill.\\
197 - No, no, no. This isn't about sex.\\
198 - I need you to watch Jake for the rest of the weekend...\\
199 - ...so that Nancy and I can go to Vegas and get married.\\
200 - Oh, God, Alan. There's no need to marry the woman.\\
201 - If you don't wanna have sex anymore, just tell her.\\
202 - No, no, you don't understand.\\
203 - This is beyond sex.\\
204 - We're in love.\\
205 - Alan, come here.\\
206 - You are not in love, you're besotted.\\
207 - No, no, no, I have never felt like this about a woman before.\\
208 - We have a bond that transcends the physical.\\
209 - - Really? - Yeah.\\
210 - - Kind of a spiritual thing? - Yes.\\
211 - Okay. I can understand that. So where's she from?\\
212 - She's from around here.\\
213 - - Where? - Supermarket.\\
214 - Charlie, stop that.\\
215 - I have thought this through and I am really and truly in love with...\\
216 - - Nancy. - I knew that. I knew that.\\
217 - I was looking for the proper adjective to describe her.\\
218 - Nuts? Easy? Limber?\\
219 - Charlie. Charlie, you started off on the wrong foot with my first wife.\\
220 - Do not make the same mistake with...\\
221 - ...wonderful Nancy.\\
222 - Okay, you're right. This is not about her. Come here. Sit down.\\
223 - - You gonna hit me? - Well, let's see how it goes.\\
224 - Okay, look, I've never been much of a big brother to you.\\
225 - I didn't protect you. I wasn't around when you started dating...\\
226 - ...when you got married and had Jake. You know why?\\
227 - - Why? - I was busy getting laid.\\
228 - Which makes me the perfect big brother to help you now.\\
229 - I've been through this. I know what it means to confuse sex with love.\\
230 - That's not what I'm doing, Charlie.\\
231 - We're talking about me, and I've been down this road many times.\\
232 - I remember this one girl.\\
233 - We had this unbelievably hot weekend together.\\
234 - It was like nothing I'd ever experienced before, and I proposed.\\
235 - - I begged her to marry me. - Wow, where did you meet?\\
236 - Detention.\\
237 - - This was in high school? - Eighth grade.\\
238 - And then years later, it happened again with a different woman.\\
239 - Instant chemistry. The sex was unbelievable.\\
240 - I was convinced we were soul mates, so I threw myself at her.\\
241 - I did everything to get her to marry me.\\
242 - And you know what? If she'd said yes...\\
243 - ...I'd now have a 67-year-old ex-wife on a belly dancer's pension.\\
244 - So, what I'm trying to say...\\
245 - ...is you're not the first guy to mistake passion for true love...\\
246 - ...and you won't be the last.\\
247 - If someone had told me what I'm telling you...\\
248 - ...I could have saved myself a lot of heartache.\\
249 - Okay. I hear you. Thank you.\\
250 - You're welcome.\\
251 - So make sure Jake doesn't fill up on junk food, and I'll call you from Circus Circus.\\
252 - Circus Circus?\\
253 - You're right, money should be no object. What's the hotel with the pirate show?\\
254 - I'm sorry, Alan, but I'm gonna have to knock you out.\\
255 - - Hello? - Mom, thank God you're here.\\
256 - Oh, I don't need your sarcasm, Charlie.\\
257 - No, I mean it. I need you. Alan needs you.\\
258 - What's going on?\\
259 - Alan, tell Mom your plans for the weekend.\\
260 - - No. - Why? Embarrassed?\\
261 - - No. No. - Ashamed?\\
262 - - Scared? - Yes.\\
263 - Sweetheart, I'm your mother. You can tell me anything.\\
264 - Okay. I met a wonderful woman in the supermarket a few days ago...\\
265 - ...and we're getting married.\\
266 - I see.\\
267 - For God's sake, if you're that horny, find a nice call girl, put her on retainer.\\
268 - This is not about sex.\\
269 - Oh, please. What else could it be?\\
270 - - Well, it could be love. - Yeah. Sure.\\
271 - Who is this woman? What does she do?\\
272 - She does Alan.\\
273 - Okay, okay, that... That is how it started...\\
274 - ...but in the last day and a half it has blossomed into so much more.\\
275 - Oh, my randy little nincompoop.\\
276 - Listen, if I had gotten married...\\
277 - ...after every weekend of hot, sweaty debauchery with a virtual stranger...\\
278 - ...you'd have, well, many more stepfathers than you already have.\\
279 - She knows what she's talking about, Alan.\\
280 - Mom's been on more hotel pillows than a chocolate mint.\\
281 - Don't help me, Charlie.\\
282 - Now... Now, listen, sweetheart. Sweetheart, no offense...\\
283 - ...but since you're dirt-poor and living with your brother...\\
284 - ...one must ask, what kind of woman would agree to marry you?\\
285 - Unless she's a little slow, or looking for a green card.\\
286 - Listen to your mommy, Alan.\\
287 - No. No, I am gonna listen to my heart.\\
288 - For your information, she hasn't agreed to marry me.\\
289 - - I haven't even asked her yet. - But you're planning to?\\
290 - - Yes. - I'm not going to hit you, darling.\\
291 - Charlie.\\
292 - Okay, look, I will thank you both to let me live my own life.\\
293 - I love Nancy, and Nancy loves me.\\
294 - And if this is a mistake, then it will be my mistake.\\
295 - Hello? Nancy. You miss me? I miss you.\\
296 - Listen, there's something I wanna ask you, but I wanna do it in person.\\
297 - Oh, oh, okay, okay. I understand.\\
298 - Yeah, sure. Sure. Bye.\\
299 - Her husband came back a day early.\\
300 - Okay, my mistake.\\
301 - - You hungry? - What do we got?\\
302 - What do you want?\\
303 - I don't know. What are my choices?\\
304 - You can cook something, or go live on the street.\\
305 - I'm not hungry.
\subsection {Episode 09: Yes, Mosignor}
1 - I decided if I was gonna get my boobs done...\\
2 - ...I might as well go whole-hog, you know what I mean?\\
3 - Yeah, I know what you mean.\\
4 - They're still pretty natural-Iooking, don't you think?\\
5 - They fooled me.\\
6 - Oh, yeah, gotta get right up on them before you can tell.\\
7 - I think they're really gonna help me reach my career goals.\\
8 - Do you remember what they were?\\
9 - What what were?\\
10 - My career goals.\\
11 - Yeah, sure. You wanna be an actress, right?\\
12 - No, silly. I wanna be a talk show host.\\
13 - Right.\\
14 - Of course, what they don't tell you is: Big boobies equal bad back.\\
15 - Say that three times fast.\\
16 - - No, thank you. - Big boobies equal bad back.\\
17 - Big boobies equal bad back. Big boobies equal bad back.\\
18 - Get your skinny little butt in here, and I'll interview you standing up.\\
19 - I'll be right there.\\
20 - Okay, we're back.\\
21 - Now, let's give a warm, soapy welcome to my next guest...\\
22 - ...and my close personal friend, Charlie Harper.\\
23 - Hey. Where you off to?\\
24 - I don't know. Anywhere.\\
25 - Charlie, the shower's still running.\\
26 - Oh, fine.\\
27 - There you are.\\
28 - Charlie! Charlie, help me!\\
29 - - What's going on? - Nothing. Go watch TV.\\
30 - Yeah, right.\\
31 - Well, I'm sorry, Alan, but who told you to go sticking your hand in my shower?\\
32 - Oh, please. How can she sue you? You have no money.\\
33 - Oh, boy.\\
34 - Nothing. Just saw an old girlfriend. Talk to you later.\\
35 - Lisa?\\
36 - Oh, boy.\\
37 - Charlie. I don't believe it.\\
38 - - You look great. - You too.\\
39 - Although if you're taking votes, I prefer the brown sock to the beige one.\\
40 - What? Oh, I got kind of dressed in a hurry this morning.\\
41 - Really? Did somebody's husband come home early?\\
42 - Why do you always assume the worst? Can't I just be hung-over?\\
43 - Sorry. So how are you?\\
44 - Fine. I mean, you know, considering.\\
45 - And you? How's married life?\\
46 - Really great. Best decision I ever made.\\
47 - You deserve all the happiness in the world...\\
48 - ...and you found a guy who can give it. - Thanks. That's very sweet.\\
49 - - I mean it sincerely. It warms my heart... - Okay, we broke up.\\
50 - Oh, I am so, so sorry. Honestly.\\
51 - Yes. Yes.\\
52 - - So, what happened? - None of your business.\\
53 - Okay.\\
54 - I thought he was the sweetest guy in the world...\\
55 - ...but after we got married, he changed.\\
56 - He started drinking a lot, and lying around the house all day.\\
57 - Oh, no.\\
58 - I caught him in the shower with some bimbo.\\
59 - Some guys, huh?\\
60 - Yeah. If I wanted that kind of life, I could have stayed with you.\\
61 - Good point. So, what are you doing for dinner?\\
62 - - You're shameless. - Thank you.\\
63 - - It's not a compliment. - Whatever.\\
64 - What are you doing for dinner?\\
65 - Charlie, a lot has changed.\\
66 - I know. I'm older and wiser, and you're hot and on the rebound.\\
67 - - Charlie. - Dinner tonight.\\
68 - I won't take no for an answer.\\
69 - Hey, lady. Lady, you forgot your baby.\\
70 - Charlie, it's not her baby.\\
71 - Shall we say 7?\\
72 - Just out of curiosity, what the hell happened in your brother's bathroom?\\
73 - - Nothing. - Dad was wrestling on the floor...\\
74 - ...with a naked lady.\\
75 - The quiet ones are always the freaks.\\
76 - - Jake, I was not wrestling. - But she was naked.\\
77 - She was taking a shower, and I didn't know.\\
78 - When I reached to turn it off, she was startled.\\
79 - It was innocent and there's no reason to tell your mother, understand?\\
80 - Sure. By the way, you have to sign my math test.\\
81 - Okay. D minus? Jake, how do you get a D minus?\\
82 - How do you get wrapped in a shower curtain...\\
83 - ...with a naked lady?\\
84 - - Did you show this to your mother? - No.\\
85 - - Why not? - I didn't catch her doing anything.\\
86 - Okay, I'll sign this.\\
87 - But you are gonna go study so this won't happen again.\\
88 - All right, but I wouldn't get my hopes up.\\
89 - If you want something from Dad, now's a good time.\\
90 - Oh, Alan, I am having the best day.\\
91 - - Really? Do share it with me. - Remember Lisa?\\
92 - Oh, is that the girl who bitch-slapped me in your shower this morning?\\
93 - No, that's Meegan...\\
94 - ...or Megan or Sue.\\
95 - Lisa is the woman that I asked to marry, but she married this other guy instead.\\
96 - They're divorced and we're having dinner. Isn't that great?\\
97 - I'd applaud, but my hand was bitten earlier.\\
98 - I'm sensing you're upset?\\
99 - Oh, no, no, no. Why would I be upset?\\
100 - I mean, besides the... The bite and the mild concussion...\\
101 - ...that I got from my head bouncing off your bathroom floor...\\
102 - ...while your shower buddy was driving her knee into my groin.\\
103 - She wants to be a talk show host. I don't see it. Not with that voice.\\
104 - And to top it all off, my son saw me entwined on the floor...\\
105 - ...with Meegan or Megan or Sue...\\
106 - ...and is now blackmailing me.\\
107 - Kid's a genius.\\
108 - Anyway, here's the wrinkle with Lisa.\\
109 - She's got a kid now.\\
110 - I'm not sure where I'm at with having an instant family.\\
111 - I'm sorry. Are we done with what's bothering me?\\
112 - I am.\\
113 - It's like talking to a horny chimp.\\
114 - Well, that was uncalled for.\\
115 - - So, what do you think? - About what?\\
116 - Lisa, me, the kid.\\
117 - Okay, let's see now.\\
118 - This is the same woman you've broken up...\\
119 - ...and gotten back with for years, right? - Right.\\
120 - And she turned you down in order to marry somebody else?\\
121 - - Yes. - And then the marriage fell apart...\\
122 - ...and now she's got his baby? - Yeah.\\
123 - Sounds perfect. Go for it.\\
124 - Okay, don't think I don't know what you're doing.\\
125 - Are you gonna be okay?\\
126 - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.\\
127 - It's just nobody's taken a crap in my car since college.\\
128 - Don't be such a baby.\\
129 - Hey, tell her.\\
130 - I'll change her diaper while your car airs out. Then you can take us home.\\
131 - But what if it happens again?\\
132 - Don't worry. I'll hold her out the window till we arrive.\\
133 - Thank you. Can I make you a nightcap?\\
134 - Charlie, I'm breastfeeding, remember?\\
135 - Oh, right, right.\\
136 - And may I say, on behalf of myself, the ma tre d'...\\
137 - ...and the entire kitchen staff that found a reason to walk past our table:\\
138 - You're doing a hell of a job.\\
139 - Look at what a good poopie you made.\\
140 - Mommy's gonna get you all cleaned up.\\
141 - - Would you throw this away? - Sure.\\
142 - You didn't throw that on the beach, did you?\\
143 - No, no. I threw it on my neighbor's deck.\\
144 - Long story. He started it.\\
145 - - So how we doing? - All done.\\
146 - Oh, good.\\
147 - Boy, you hear all these horror stories about screaming babies...\\
148 - ...but she's not half bad.\\
149 - She's my little angel.\\
150 - Kind of weird, huh? You and me and a baby.\\
151 - Yeah.\\
152 - Not that the baby's weird. It's just the whole, you know, gestalt.\\
153 - You are so sweet.\\
154 - I know.\\
155 - Wanna go upstairs?\\
156 - - No, I have to go home. - Why?\\
157 - What do you mean, why? I have a baby.\\
158 - Okay, she can stay too.\\
159 - I can't spend the night. I didn't bring enough diapers...\\
160 - ...the bassinet. I don't have a breast pump.\\
161 - So? We'll do it the old-fashioned way.\\
162 - What are you gonna do, Charlie? Milk me?\\
163 - What kind of thing is that to say?\\
164 - What makes you think I'm ready to jump back into bed with you?\\
165 - I don't know. Because I'm sweet?\\
166 - You weren't ready when I was single.\\
167 - How are you gonna handle me and a baby?\\
168 - Easy. I love babies, babies love me. Look how good I get along with Jake.\\
169 - Jake's 11.\\
170 - So? He was 10 when I met him.\\
171 - Gosh, they grow so quickly, don't they?\\
172 - - Okay, look. If you're serious... - I am.\\
173 - - come over tomorrow night to our place. I'll make dinner, we'll see what happens.\\
174 - Or we go to your place now...\\
175 - ...having already eaten, and see what happens.\\
176 - Still incapable of delaying gratification, aren't you?\\
177 - No, no, no, I've grown.\\
178 - I learned to put the needs of others before me.\\
179 - - Really? - Oh, yeah. Absolutely.\\
180 - The old thoughtless, selfish Charlie is gone...\\
181 - ...and I say good riddance to him.\\
182 - Now, come on. I'll take you home.\\
183 - - Charlie? - Yeah?\\
184 - The baby.\\
185 - This makes no sense.\\
186 - It's math. It makes perfect sense.\\
187 - Well, then I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.\\
188 - No, you just have to do the work.\\
189 - Well, maybe I have a learning disability, or a syndrome of some sort.\\
190 - You don't have a learning disability. You're just lazy.\\
191 - Maybe that's the syndrome.\\
192 - See you later. And by "later," I'm hoping tomorrow.\\
193 - Is there anything in your shower I need to know about?\\
194 - Oh, come on. That's the most action you've had in months.\\
195 - I have a loose tooth.\\
196 - Can't you just be happy for me? The woman I love is back in my life.\\
197 - That's great. I'm thrilled. I can't eat apples.\\
198 - I'll bring you back some applesauce from Lisa's.\\
199 - Her kid needs to lay off the fiber anyway.\\
200 - Oh, yeah. How's that working out?\\
201 - With the kid? She's great. I love kids.\\
202 - Really? Tell me. How many diapers have you changed so far?\\
203 - Well, none, actually. But I am credited with an assist.\\
204 - - Have you fed the baby? - No.\\
205 - - Dressed the baby? Bathed the baby? - No. What's your point, Alan?\\
206 - - Nothing. Have fun. - Thanks.\\
207 - I intend to.\\
208 - Don't think I don't know what you're doing.\\
209 - - What was that? - Coyotes, Charlie.\\
210 - Probably dropped her pacifier. I'll be right back.\\
211 - - No, no, no. You stay. I'll take care of it. - Really?\\
212 - Oh, yeah. No problem. I'm great with babies.\\
213 - Pacifier is the little nipple thing, right?\\
214 - Be right back.\\
215 - Hey, little baby, you decent?\\
216 - Okay, here's your pacifier, sweetie.\\
217 - Not as good as the real thing, am I right?\\
218 - Smells like one of us just crapped our pants.\\
219 - I sure hope it's you.\\
220 - Let's take a look.\\
221 - Charlie? You okay?\\
222 - - What? - Is everything okay?\\
223 - Oh, yeah. Just a little diaper issue. I can take care of it.\\
224 - And then I'll be back to take care of you.\\
225 - Okay. Let's just take this thing off.\\
226 - Oh, sweet Lord.\\
227 - Did you have Thai food for dinner, or what?\\
228 - Man, Babe Ruth took smaller dumps.\\
229 - Do you need any help?\\
230 - What?\\
231 - Do you need any help?\\
232 - No, we're good.\\
233 - Okay. Now we wipe the tushy.\\
234 - Sorry. It's not you. It's me.\\
235 - Wipe it again. Third time's the charm.\\
236 - Little powder. Oh, that smells nice.\\
237 - Maybe a little powder for my tushy. Don 't tell your mommy.\\
238 - Charlie, I can hear you on the monitor.\\
239 - Oh, right.\\
240 - People of Earth...\\
241 - ... we mean you no harm.\\
242 - See? This one is wrong, this is wrong. Jake, you have to check your work.\\
243 - These are careless mistakes.\\
244 - Maybe I'm not careless. Maybe I ate lead paint as a child.\\
245 - - Here. Do it again. - Fine.\\
246 - Dad, are you and Mom related?\\
247 - I'm sorry. What?\\
248 - Well, if you marry your cousin, your kids will be stupid, right?\\
249 - Jake, you're not stupid, your mother's not my cousin...\\
250 - ...and you're not going anywhere until you do your homework.\\
251 - Like I have somewhere to go.\\
252 - There we go. You were a hungry little girl.\\
253 - Of course she was hungry.\\
254 - She must of dropped half her body weight in that last diaper.\\
255 - What a good burp. Wasn't that a good burp, Charlie?\\
256 - Oh, yeah. Wait till you meet my nephew.\\
257 - He can belch the theme from Shaft.\\
258 - All right. Good night, sweetheart.\\
259 - Oh, there we go.\\
260 - Now, where were we?\\
261 - Oh, yeah.\\
262 - You know, I'm a little tired. Aren't you tired?\\
263 - - What's wrong? - Nothing.\\
264 - Was it the breastfeeding? Because in the restaurant, it turned you on.\\
265 - I know, but there I wasn't on deck.\\
266 - So you don't wanna fool around?\\
267 - It's not that. I'm looking at the sexiest woman in the world...\\
268 - ...and all I can see is a Thermos.\\
269 - Charlie, there are things you do with your penis that aren't exactly a turn-on.\\
270 - You mean the puppet show?\\
271 - I thought you loved The Amazing Adventures of Stretch Armstrong.\\
272 - That's not what I meant. Now, come on. Come to mama.\\
273 - Okay, time. "Come to mama" bums me a little.\\
274 - Can we make it "Come to Catholic schoolgirl"?\\
275 - Yes, Monsignor.\\
276 - Hallelujah.\\
277 - Here you go. Two sugars, no cream.\\
278 - Oh, perfect. And I don't mind saying, last night was none too shabby either.\\
279 - "Dear diary: Coffee perfect, sex none too shabby."\\
280 - You know what I mean.\\
281 - I can't remember why we kept breaking up.\\
282 - - You can't? - Well, I can. I was just being romantic.\\
283 - - What are you doing? - Putting on my pants.\\
284 - You're leaving already?\\
285 - No.\\
286 - So why are you putting on your pants, then?\\
287 - I don't know. Did you wanna wear them?\\
288 - Forget it.\\
289 - Hey, I've gotta go home sooner or later.\\
290 - - Go home whenever you want. - I can't leave...\\
291 - ...when you're in this mood. - What mood?\\
292 - This mood.\\
293 - Oh, just leave, Charlie. It's what you do best.\\
294 - No, it's what I do after I do what I do best.\\
295 - Oh, come on. I was just putting on my pants.\\
296 - - You wanna spend the day with us? - The whole day?\\
297 - - Here are your shoes. - Hang on a second.\\
298 - Is this some hormonal thing because of the baby?\\
299 - No, it's some kind of stupid thing because you're stupid.\\
300 - Any time I don't behave the way you want, it's hormonal.\\
301 - Not every time, but you gotta admit there is a pattern.\\
302 - You know the pattern I see?\\
303 - Every time things start going well for us, you find an excuse to run.\\
304 - No, no, no. You push me away.\\
305 - How? How do I push you away?\\
306 - Like this. You pick a fight over nothing and say I can't commit.\\
307 - - You can't commit. - Hey, I can commit.\\
308 - Oh, yeah? Prove it.\\
309 - Fine. I'll start right now.\\
310 - I'm gonna stay here all day.\\
311 - - Really? - Really.\\
312 - We're talking a business day, right?\\
313 - - Hey. How did it go with Lisa? - I don't think it's gonna work out.\\
314 - Really? Even with the little baby there to help smooth things along?\\
315 - It wasn't the baby.\\
316 - She has commitment issues.\\
317 - Oh, that's too bad. Hey, what's that splattered all over your shirt?\\
318 - Coffee and breast milk.\\
319 - What happened? Did Starbucks merge with Hooters?\\
320 - Hooterbucks.\\
321 - I'd like a double-D cup latte, please.\\
322 - Dad, you gotta sign this.\\
323 - Another D? Jake, what is wrong with you?\\
324 - Well, I have a theory.\\
325 - Oh, really? Another one. Do tell.\\
326 - I'm a crack baby.\\
327 - Kid's a genius.
\subsection {Episode 10: The Salmon Under My Sweater}
1 - - What you doing? - I'm working.\\
2 - You're not gonna get much done with the TV on.\\
3 - - What are you, my mother? - Your mother says that too?\\
4 - Listen, when you write music for a living...\\
5 - ...you have to wait for inspiration.\\
6 - Nope, not yet.\\
7 - Charlie, wanna come to the movies with us?\\
8 - He can't. He's working.\\
9 - - On what, liver failure? - Wonderful.\\
10 - He's my mother, you're my doctor.\\
11 - Oh, I assume you finished reading Lord of the Flies for your book report.\\
12 - Oh, good. How'd you like it?\\
13 - I thought it was a timeless American classic.\\
14 - I see. So tell me, what's it about?\\
15 - - You mean the book? - Yeah, the book.\\
16 - It's called Lord of the Flies...\\
17 - ...and it's about a really big fly...\\
18 - ...that all the other flies pray to.\\
19 - - And you thought he didn't read it. - Oh, I was just joking.\\
20 - It's more like Charlotte's Web, but from the fly's point of view.\\
21 - You've had more than a week. Why didn't you read the book?\\
22 - - I've been waiting for inspiration. - Attaboy.\\
23 - Okay, how's this for inspiration? We're not going to the movies...\\
24 - ...and you're not doing anything until you finish reading that book.\\
25 - - That's not fair. - Course it's fair. We had a deal.\\
26 - - You didn't keep your end of it. - Oh, so now two wrongs make a right?\\
27 - Bet you didn't see that one coming.\\
28 - You're really gonna like this book if you give it a chance.\\
29 - It's about kids stranded on a deserted island.\\
30 - - How'd they get stranded? - Their plane crashes.\\
31 - Oh, really. And then what happens?\\
32 - This one kid named Ralph becomes their leader, and they form this society, and...\\
33 - Just read the book.\\
34 - - One big fly, huh? - Hey, I took a shot.\\
35 - Hi.\\
36 - - Charlie's working, Rose. - Oh, what about Jake?\\
37 - He's studying.\\
38 - - Hey, do you like smoked salmon? - I guess.\\
39 - Good. Then this is for you.\\
40 - - I don't know what to say. - Neither do I, most of the time.\\
41 - But then I start talking, and stuff just comes out.\\
42 - So, what are you doing this fine Saturday night?\\
43 - I was supposed go to the movies with Jake...\\
44 - ...but he didn't do his homework, so...\\
45 - So you're punishing him by sitting out here all by yourself, alone and miserable.\\
46 - What a good dad.\\
47 - If you still wanna go to the movies, I'll go with you.\\
48 - - You and me? Like a...? Like a date? - Alan, are you asking me out?\\
49 - - I don't think so. - Okay.\\
50 - That was a little awkward. Come on, we'll catch an early show.\\
51 - Oh, all right. All right, why not.\\
52 - I'll sneak in the salmon under my sweater.\\
53 - Good. That way, we don't have to pay for that overpriced movie fish.\\
54 - - Hey. What you doing? - Working.\\
55 - How do you know when you're on a break?\\
56 - That's the thing about being a grownup, my little friend: You don't get breaks.\\
57 - Is this the new Oshikuru: Demon Samurai?\\
58 - - Yeah. - What are you doing with it?\\
59 - It's being turned into a cartoon, and they asked me to write the theme song.\\
60 - - Awesome. - Yeah?\\
61 - - Wanna hear what I got so far? - Sure.\\
62 - So I'll be, like, the first kid in the world to hear this.\\
63 - Yep.\\
64 - Now, this is just a rough version, but you get an idea of the feel of it.\\
65 - Okay.\\
66 - Oh, oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru Oh, oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru\\
67 - My, oh, my He's a demon samurai\\
68 - Who 's the guy who had to die? Oshikuru\\
69 - Boy. That really blows.\\
70 - Excuse me?\\
71 - - Did you even read the comic? - Yeah, I looked it over.\\
72 - Oh, really? What's it about?\\
73 - It's about this guy named Oshikuru, who dies...\\
74 - ...and comes back as a, what do you call it, samurai.\\
75 - - And he's a demon. - No.\\
76 - It's about a teenage boy in a futuristic society...\\
77 - ...who's possessed by the tortured soul of a feudal Japanese warrior...\\
78 - ...condemned to walk the earth fighting the evil he once embodied.\\
79 - So, what's your point?\\
80 - He lives in a dark world. He battles the spirits of the damned.\\
81 - Your theme doesn't capture the mood at all. It just blows.\\
82 - - Okay, okay, you said "blows" already. - Did I say "big baby chunks"?\\
83 - All right, fine. Thanks for your input.\\
84 - Why don't you go read Lord of the Flies, and let me do my job.\\
85 - Well, if your job is ruining a great comic book, you can call it a night.\\
86 - - I heard that. - Good.\\
87 - Oh, no. What do you wanna bet Shrek here sits right in front of us.\\
88 - Don't worry. It'll be all right.\\
89 - You had to eat the chili cheeseburger.\\
90 - - That wasn't really necessary. - You'd have done the same thing for me.\\
91 - I'm not so sure.\\
92 - - So, Alan, tell me about yourself. - What would you like to know?\\
93 - Everything. I really don't know that much about you...\\
94 - ...aside from the fact that you're Charlie's brother and Jake's dad.\\
95 - Graduated from Cal State Long Beach, married your college sweetheart...\\
96 - ...and in the middle of the night, when you're half-asleep, you pee sitting down.\\
97 - - Have you been spying on me? - No, silly.\\
98 - I spy on Charlie. You just get in the way sometimes.\\
99 - You know what? Why don't you tell me about you.\\
100 - Well, okay. Well, let's see.\\
101 - I, too, pee sitting down, so we have that in common.\\
102 - I come from a wealthy family, so I guess I've had kind of a sheltered life.\\
103 - You know, fancy private schools and colleges.\\
104 - - No kidding. - What college did you go to?\\
105 - Princeton. But just for two years.\\
106 - - Oh, so you dropped out? - No, I finished.\\
107 - Then I came back to California to do my master's at Stanford.\\
108 - That's amazing. What's your degree in?\\
109 - Behavioral psychology.\\
110 - Hey, Jake. Jake, wake up. I want you to hear something.\\
111 - - What? - I've been working on the song.\\
112 - - Good for you. - Come on. Come listen to it.\\
113 - - I'm sleeping. - Sleep in school, like everybody else.\\
114 - I read the comic books cover to cover.\\
115 - I know the characters, I know their world.\\
116 - I think I got it. Listen.\\
117 - A teenage boy with the spirit inside Of a samurai warrior who long ago died\\
118 - Now he's oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru\\
119 - Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru\\
120 - My, oh, my He's a demon samurai\\
121 - Who 's the guy who had to die? Oshikuru\\
122 - Still blows.\\
123 - Yeah, well, you're still short.\\
124 - - Hey. - Hey.\\
125 - Sorry I'm late. We stopped for a bite to eat after the movie.\\
126 - - No problem. - An usher confiscated our fish.\\
127 - - Hey, can I play you something? - Sure.\\
128 - You know, I had a really good time with Rose.\\
129 - There's a lot more there than meets the eye.\\
130 - Yeah. Cool. Listen to this. Tell me what you think.\\
131 - A teenage boy with the spirit inside Of a samurai warrior who long ago died\\
132 - Now he's oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru\\
133 - Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru\\
134 - My, oh, my He's a demon samurai\\
135 - Who 's the guy who had to die? Oshikuru\\
136 - Very nice. It's snappy.\\
137 - - You really like it? - Yeah, yeah. Good work.\\
138 - Okay, that settles it. It blows.\\
139 - Berta, you know what's a good book? Lord of the Flies.\\
140 - Oh, yeah. I read that when I was about your age.\\
141 - - So, what'd you think? - I liked it.\\
142 - - It was like Survivor with kids. - Yeah. I agree.\\
143 - - Is Survivor spelled like it sounds? - Just read the damn book.\\
144 - - Morning, Berta. - Morning.\\
145 - Hey, did you know that Rose has a master's degree in psychology?\\
146 - No. Did you know I'm a founding member of the Mile High Club?\\
147 - - Really? - Yeah. Me and Orville at Kitty Hawk.\\
148 - I'd have done Wilbur too, but we were only in the air for 90 seconds.\\
149 - Okay, you're kidding, and it's funny.\\
150 - But the truth is, you and I see each other every day...\\
151 - ...and we don't know much about each other.\\
152 - So you wanna know what goes on underneath this gruff exterior.\\
153 - Whether somewhere inside me, there's a tiny little girl...\\
154 - ...who once dreamed of being a famous ballerina.\\
155 - - Is there? - lf there is...\\
156 - ...it's because I accidentally ate one and haven't passed her yet.\\
157 - Let me tell you, I am dreading that tiara.\\
158 - - Okay. Well, it was nice talking to you. - Hey, I feel closer.\\
159 - Oh, are you starting that book report already?\\
160 - - Just making notes. - Good for you. What do you have so far?\\
161 - Lord of the Flies is kind of like Survivor, but with kids.\\
162 - That's an interesting analogy. What's your favorite part?\\
163 - When the first kid gets voted off the island?\\
164 - Hey, all right.\\
165 - Stop trying to be friends with Berta. It just pisses her off.\\
166 - What doesn't?\\
167 - Hey, I was gonna do some shopping, and was hoping you could watch Jake.\\
168 - - Sure. - Ready when you are, Alan.\\
169 - - Be right there. I'll see you later. - No, wait, wait, wait. Hold on.\\
170 - - You're going out with Rose again? - No, I'm not "going out" with her.\\
171 - - We're just going shopping. - Morning, Charlie.\\
172 - You haven't forgotten that she's a little bent, right?\\
173 - No, I think there's a lot more to her than that.\\
174 - - Deep down, there's a good person. - Deep down, there's a few good people.\\
175 - And all of them are bent.\\
176 - - He'll be right with you, Rose. - Okay.\\
177 - - Charlie, everybody has flaws. - Flaws?\\
178 - She Superglued my testicles to my thigh.\\
179 - That was the past. We've all done things we're ashamed of.\\
180 - She's not ashamed. She took a picture, then used it for her Christmas card.\\
181 - Thank God it was an extreme close-up. Most people thought it was a fruit bat.\\
182 - Okay, well, I appreciate your concern...\\
183 - ...but I think Rose is a sweet, smart, interesting woman.\\
184 - I enjoy spending time with her. Meet me out front.\\
185 - Okey-dokey.\\
186 - - Hey, what're you doing? - Reading Lord of the Flies.\\
187 - Not important.\\
188 - - Now, listen. You're a kid, right? - Yeah.\\
189 - Okay. I'm writing a song for kids.\\
190 - So assuming that what I've done already blows...\\
191 - - It does. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
192 - Assuming that, you need to help me make it better.\\
193 - - But I have to do a book report. - Okay.\\
194 - I'll help you with the book report. You help me with the song.\\
195 - - Quid pro quo. - No.\\
196 - "Oshikuru."\\
197 - Here you go. Raspberry-mango-banana with a shot of wheatgrass.\\
198 - - Thank you. - My pleasure.\\
199 - You know, sometimes I like to come to the mall...\\
200 - ...and just watch people and make up stories about who they are...\\
201 - ...and what their lives are like. - Oh, well, that's fun.\\
202 - What about that lady over there? What do you think her life is like?\\
203 - Well, I'd say she's a smart woman, but very Ionely.\\
204 - So used to rejection, it's become like the air she breathes...\\
205 - ...which is all the more sad because she's got so much to give.\\
206 - Emotionally, spiritually, sexually. Especially sexually.\\
207 - She is ripe, smoldering and willing to try anything.\\
208 - - What about that lady over there? - Her?\\
209 - Well, let's see. She's a little tougher to read.\\
210 - I'd say she's a smart woman, very Ionely.\\
211 - So used to rejection, it's become like the air she breathes...\\
212 - ...which is all the more sad...\\
213 - See, even though Oshikuru is for kids, it's not really a kids' comic.\\
214 - - It's very mature. - Okay, I think I got it.\\
215 - The demons Oshikuru fights only exist...\\
216 - ...because they are a reflection of the tortured demons in his own soul.\\
217 - - Yes. - So, in essence...\\
218 - ...Oshikuru is like a Japanese sci-fi version of Moby Dick.\\
219 - - What? - You said, "Moby Dick."\\
220 - I mean, sure, being single can be Ionely sometimes...\\
221 - ...but it's better than being together with someone you don't love or respect.\\
222 - - Is that what your marriage was like? - Well, according to my ex-wife, it was.\\
223 - Hey, as long as we're done here...\\
224 - ...why don't we take a drive down to the beach and take a walk.\\
225 - - Alan, are you flirting with me? - Oh, no, no.\\
226 - I just thought, you know, since it's a beautiful day...\\
227 - If you are, it's okay.\\
228 - - Really? - Yeah.\\
229 - There's a lot more to you than I thought.\\
230 - - What did you think? - Oh, let's not spoil the moment.\\
231 - Okay. So, what do we do now?\\
232 - - Wanna try kissing? - Yes, I think we should.\\
233 - - Okay. - Yeah.\\
234 - - Wanna get a room? - Excuse me?\\
235 - Or we can go back to my place, unless you're afraid of ferrets.\\
236 - - Ferrets? - Yeah.\\
237 - I have five of the toothy little guys.\\
238 - No kidding. Five ferrets.\\
239 - - Those are like long, furry rats, right? - Yep.\\
240 - And they're all named Charlie.\\
241 - Of course they are.\\
242 - Well, as much as I would love to meet...\\
243 - ...Charlie and Charlie and Charlie and Charlie...\\
244 - - And Charlie. - Right.\\
245 - I can't help but wonder, is it worth putting our friendship at risk?\\
246 - Well, that's a good question. Let's think about it for a minute.\\
247 - How good are you in bed? Because I'm excellent.\\
248 - Truthfully, I'm more of an advanced intermediate.\\
249 - - Then let's stay friends. - Yeah, good idea.\\
250 - - Can I ask you a question? - Sure.\\
251 - What, specifically, turned you off to the idea of a physical liaison?\\
252 - Was it the psychosexual fraternal rivalry, symbolized by the Charlie surrogates?\\
253 - Or the prospect of being judged inadequate...\\
254 - ...by a woman who professes to have superior sexual skills?\\
255 - Wait a minute. Have you been doing that behavioral psychology thing on me?\\
256 - No, don't be silly.\\
257 - But if I said yes, would that make you feel A, angry, or B, insecure?\\
258 - I thought you were gonna write the report for me.\\
259 - No, Jake. That would be wrong.\\
260 - The only way to learn is to do the work yourself.\\
261 - Now, these are called Cliff Notes.\\
262 - Inside is everything you need to know about Lord of the Flies.\\
263 - The themes, the characters, the symbolism.\\
264 - It's a book report waiting for you to put your name on it.\\
265 - Is that legal?\\
266 - Look around. Do you see any homework police?\\
267 - Oh, man. I give you way too much credit.\\
268 - Oh, I meant to ask you, how'd that book report turn out?\\
269 - - I got a D-minus. - D-minus?\\
270 - - Didn't you read the Cliff Notes? - That was 50 pages.\\
271 - Unbelievable. Your kid's too lazy to cheat.\\
272 - Has it occurred to you that maybe he's too honest to cheat?\\
273 - No, I'm lazy.\\
274 - - Oshikuru: Demon Samurai. - Hey, it's on.\\
275 - Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru\\
276 - My, oh, my He's a demon samurai\\
277 - Who 's the guy who had to die? Oshikuru\\
278 - That's not what we wrote. That's your original, sucky version.\\
279 - What can I tell you? The network liked that one better.\\
280 - - What, are they brain-damaged? - Welcome to show business, kid.\\
281 - I still think it's snappy.\\
282 - Oshikuru

1 - Two white wines and a Jack and ginger.\\
2 - Please tell me the Jack and ginger isn't for you.\\
3 - No, it's for my girlfriend. Why?\\
4 - You look like a woman of discriminating taste...\\
5 - ...and mixing a quality bourbon with ginger ale...\\
6 - ...is like putting Cheez Whiz on lobster Newburgh.\\
7 - Well, what if I said the Jack and ginger was for me?\\
8 - Well, then, I'd learn to live with it.\\
9 - - Charlie. - Gail.\\
10 - Sorry I'm late. I stopped off at Radio Barn, and wait till you see what I got.\\
11 - Alan, I'm kind of in the middle of...\\
12 - Damn you to hell.\\
13 - - What? What did I do? - Forget it.\\
14 - It's who you are, you can't help yourself.\\
15 - Okay. Anyway, check this out. Know what that is?\\
16 - - A two megapixel, full-color webcam. - Right.\\
17 - How do I do it?\\
18 - I got one for me and for Jake. We can hook them to our computers...\\
19 - ...so when he's at his mother's, we can have video chats.\\
20 - - That's cool. - Isn't it?\\
21 - Yeah, with a couple of these, phone sex becomes less phone and more sex.\\
22 - These are to maintain my relationship with Jake.\\
23 - It's the worst part of the divorce:\\
24 - - Only seeing him on weekends. - I get that. I sympathize.\\
25 - But you can see the validity of my vision too, right?\\
26 - Oh, look. Built-in microphone. Totally hands-free. Perfect.\\
27 - - Excuse me. - Oh, hey, Gail. Good to see you again.\\
28 - Don't move, don't talk.\\
29 - - Are you Charlie Harper? - Yeah. Why?\\
30 - You were right. It's him.\\
31 - What...? What...? What's funny?\\
32 - Nothing.\\
33 - So listen, can I buy you a drink?\\
34 - He wants to buy me a drink.\\
35 - Then what? We go back to your beach house...\\
36 - ...sit on the deck, look at the stars, talk about how you love being an uncle...\\
37 - ...and how you'd like kids of your own...\\
38 - ...and by the way, I have the most beautiful eyes in the world.\\
39 - I'm sorry. Have we met before?\\
40 - No. And we're not gonna meet now.\\
41 - Okay. I have a bad feeling.\\
42 - Is the camera on?\\
43 - Good. Now, hit "connect."\\
44 - I can see you. Can you see me?\\
45 - Yeah, yeah. I can hear you too. You can hang up the phone.\\
46 - This is awesome.\\
47 - - Yeah, we can see each other every day. - Cool.\\
48 - So...\\
49 - What's new?\\
50 - Nothing.\\
51 - What's new with you?\\
52 - Not much.\\
53 - - Hey, Charlie. - Rose, stop.\\
54 - - What? - We're friends now, right?\\
55 - Right.\\
56 - Our one-night stand is ancient history. You're not stalking me anymore, right?\\
57 - - Right. - Then use the damn stairs.\\
58 - - Really? - Yes.\\
59 - Okay.\\
60 - - I'm opening up the gate. - I'm proud of you.\\
61 - - I'm starting up the stairs. - You can do it.\\
62 - Oh, boy.\\
63 - I don't know about this.\\
64 - - You'll get used to it. - Yeah, we'll see.\\
65 - I'm surprised to see you home.\\
66 - - It's ladies' night at Pavlov's. - I know.\\
67 - Well, isn't that kind of like rabbit season for Elmer Fudd?\\
68 - Used to be.\\
69 - Let me ask you question.\\
70 - How much do chicks talk about men they've been with?\\
71 - Not as much as you'd think.\\
72 - - Really? - Way more.\\
73 - - Why? - Well, I ran into some women last night.\\
74 - Never met them before.\\
75 - But they seem to have already formed a poor opinion of me.\\
76 - So you think somebody's out there spreading nasty rumors?\\
77 - Worse. I think somebody's out there spreading the truth.\\
78 - Well, you have burned a few bridges in this town.\\
79 - Hey, I don't burn bridges. I have casual sex with relative strangers.\\
80 - There's a difference.\\
81 - And I'm always honest.\\
82 - I never lead a woman on. Unless I'm, you know, totally bombed.\\
83 - Last night was probably the result of one woman with an ax to grind.\\
84 - Probably.\\
85 - Yeah, that's it.\\
86 - - I'm making myself crazy over nothing. - Oh, I do that all the time.\\
87 - It's a great way to fill up a slow weekend.\\
88 - Rose, that night we spent together...\\
89 - ...did I tell you you had beautiful eyes?\\
90 - Well, let's see. We had a couple of drinks, you invited me back here.\\
91 - We were sitting out on the deck, looking at the stars.\\
92 - And, yeah, you said:\\
93 - "By the way, you have the most beautiful eyes in the world."\\
94 - I guess I do use that a lot.\\
95 - But, damn it, it's good.\\
96 - Are you sure it's not red? Look again.\\
97 - It looks fine. You have to go to school tomorrow.\\
98 - - Good night, Rose. - Night, Charlie.\\
99 - And don't forget to use the...\\
100 - Never mind.\\
101 - Oh, Charlie, Charlie. Come here.\\
102 - - Say hello to your Uncle Charlie. - Hey, Uncle Charlie.\\
103 - - Hi, Jake. - I can see you.\\
104 - I can see you too.\\
105 - So...\\
106 - What's new?\\
107 - Not much. What's new with you?\\
108 - Nothing. Oh, wait. I Googled you...\\
109 - ... and you'll never guess what I found.\\
110 - Jake, are you in the bathtub?\\
111 - Yeah. Gotta go.\\
112 - No, no, no. Wait, Jake, what are you talking about?\\
113 - - What's he talking about? - I don't know.\\
114 - But if you Google me, you'll find pages that mention...\\
115 - ...my San Fernando Valley Chiropractor of the Year award.\\
116 - That's nice. Get out of the way.\\
117 - Oh, careful. There's another Alan J. Harper.\\
118 - He's a school bus driver, and he also makes these decorative pigs...\\
119 - ...out of bleach bottles and pipe cleaners.\\
120 - I'm not Googling you. I'm Googling me.\\
121 - "CharlieHarperSucks. com."\\
122 - That's gotta be a different Charlie Harper.\\
123 - Okay.\\
124 - I have a bad feeling.\\
125 - Oh, boy.\\
126 - Oh, man.\\
127 - Oh, crap.\\
128 - - Are you still reading that thing? - How can I not?\\
129 - It's an entire website devoted to trashing me.\\
130 - Listen to this:\\
131 - "Has anybody had sex with Charlie where he actually took his socks off?"\\
132 - That's just mean. I have bad circulation in my feet.\\
133 - They get cold.\\
134 - Check this out. Some girl posted audio off her answering machine.\\
135 - Hey, it's me. I just wanted to tell you I had a great time last night.\\
136 - - And I'm looking forward... - Hello, Charlie?\\
137 - Yeah, hi.\\
138 - We weren 't together last night.\\
139 - Allison?\\
140 - No, Beth.\\
141 - Thursday.\\
142 - I had a great time with you Thursday, and I thought that may...\\
143 - Oh, Alan, what am I gonna do?\\
144 - Every woman in the city can see this stuff.\\
145 - Every woman in the world.\\
146 - Oh, God.\\
147 - Well, you know what they say.\\
148 - Any publicity is...\\
149 - Good publicity.\\
150 - No, no, no. What I do requires secrecy.\\
151 - I need shadows and darkness. I'm like a magician.\\
152 - If everybody knows how I do it, it ceases to be entertaining.\\
153 - "Frequently Asked Questions."\\
154 - - Don't read that. - Yeah, right.\\
155 - Okay. Question:\\
156 - "How long can you expect to date Charlie after you have sex with him?"\\
157 - Answer: " It depends how late you sleep the next morning."\\
158 - Oh, come on. This is funny. You're just too close to it.\\
159 - This could be interesting. Question:\\
160 - "How does Charlie manage to fake my orgasm?"\\
161 - All right, stop it. Move over.\\
162 - - What are you doing? - I've gotta fight back.\\
163 - Anybody can post on the message board. Why not me?\\
164 - - You're gonna post as yourself? - Don't be ridiculous.\\
165 - Everybody uses a screen name.\\
166 - "CharlieFreak219."\\
167 - Too many?\\
168 - Okay.\\
169 - CharlieFreak180.\\
170 - "In my experience...\\
171 - ...Charlie has always been...\\
172 - ...a generous lover...\\
173 - ...compassionate, fun-Ioving and sensitive."\\
174 - There. That ought to bring a little balance to the conversation.\\
175 - You really don't get the Internet, do you?\\
176 - Oh, look. I've got a response already.\\
177 - "Dear Freak: Are you just stupid...\\
178 - ...or did your skull bounce off his headboard too many times?"\\
179 - Okay, I've had enough of this.\\
180 - - How do I delete this whole thing? - You can't delete a website.\\
181 - Only the person who created it can.\\
182 - - Well, how do I find out who created it? - Now, let's see. Come on.\\
183 - Okay.\\
184 - Okay, the domain is the property of a company in the Cayman Islands called:\\
185 - "Charlie Harper Sucks Limited."\\
186 - Well, that's no help.\\
187 - Hey, you can buy T-shirts and coffee mugs.\\
188 - "Add to cart."\\
189 - No, Mom, it is not that simple.\\
190 - I am a single mother now. Dating is very complicated.\\
191 - I understand.\\
192 - No, I can 't go back to Alan.\\
193 - Of course I still love him.\\
194 - Hey, Alan?\\
195 - How long you think this Internet fad is gonna last?\\
196 - - Okay. - What?\\
197 - Jake must've turned on his webcam before he went to school.\\
198 - I can see and hear Judith talking to her mother on the phone.\\
199 - - Why can't she hear us? - Our side's turned off.\\
200 - Are you kidding? Alan would never take me back. How do I know?\\
201 - I just know.\\
202 - Okay, fine. I'll ask him.\\
203 - - She wants me back. - Yes, I will ask him.\\
204 - That's nice. It's all about you.\\
205 - Okay.\\
206 - Listen, Mom, I gotta get in the shower.\\
207 - I got it. Yes.\\
208 - All right. I'll call you later.\\
209 - Oh, man.\\
210 - - Charlie, I need to talk about this. - Me too.\\
211 - If I don't do something about that website...\\
212 - ...I'm gonna have to chase Amish broads.\\
213 - Judith wants to reconcile. I've dreamed about this...\\
214 - ...but now that it's here, I wonder if it's what I want.\\
215 - Whoever put up that site has to be somebody I went out with at least once.\\
216 - It would be great for Jake to have both parents in one house.\\
217 - And without alimony, I could stop getting my hair cut at the barber college.\\
218 - I can eliminate married chicks, ones that don't speak English...\\
219 - ...and those to whom I was never properly introduced.\\
220 - I'll make a list of the pros and cons of going back to her.\\
221 - You know what? I'm gonna need to make a list.\\
222 - - I'm glad we talked. - I'm always here for you.\\
223 - Me too.\\
224 - Hi, Tina. Long time, huh?\\
225 - Charlie Harper. What do you want?\\
226 - I know things didn't end well between us, and...\\
227 - Really? I thought they ended perfectly.\\
228 - We spent a week in Canc n, having great sex every day.\\
229 - Flew back to L.A. You told me you'd call me tomorrow, and it's been...\\
230 - What do you know? A year and a half.\\
231 - - That long? - Oh, yeah.\\
232 - I guess time flies when you're the scum of the earth.\\
233 - Okay, I had that coming.\\
234 - I was thoughtless and insensitive, and I know I can never really make up for it...\\
235 - ...but I want you to know that I was wrong, and I'm really, truly sorry.\\
236 - - And...? - No "and."\\
237 - I just wanted to apologize for being a jerk. I wanna make amends.\\
238 - - You really mean that, don't you? - I do. Absolutely.\\
239 - - You wanna come in for a cup of coffee? - Sure, I guess.\\
240 - So, seeing anybody?\\
241 - "Pro: No alimony. Con: No sex."\\
242 - "Pro: See Jake all the time. Con: See Judith all the time."\\
243 - What are you doing? Give me that.\\
244 - - I'm sorry. It was just laying there. - That's private.\\
245 - Okay.\\
246 - I got another "pro" for you.\\
247 - - Yeah? What's that? - lf you hook back up with Olive Oyl...\\
248 - ...I won't have to scrub your toilet anymore.\\
249 - Pro: No more Berta.\\
250 - You're not really thinking about going back, are you?\\
251 - I don't know. She wants to, but I'm torn.\\
252 - You're not torn. You're gutless.\\
253 - - Do you still love her? - Of course I do.\\
254 - I mean, you know, we've been though a lot of things together.\\
255 - - She's the mother of my son. - Okay, listen to me, Zippy.\\
256 - If that's all it took to make a marriage...\\
257 - ...I'd have a husband for each of my tattoos.\\
258 - - You have tattoos? - Yeah. You wanna see them?\\
259 - No.\\
260 - You're overthinking this. When your dog dies, you don't make a list.\\
261 - You bury him, plant a shrub on top...\\
262 - ...tell the kids he's running around a farm, and move on.\\
263 - That's actually a very apt metaphor.\\
264 - My failed marriage is like a dead dog.\\
265 - But it serves as fertilizer for the shrub, which represents my new life.\\
266 - So if I try to revitalize the marriage... You know, digging up the dog.\\
267 - - then I'm killing the shrub, which is me.\\
268 - Like you said, it's apt.\\
269 - Thank you, Berta. You're a very insightful woman.\\
270 - I know. In a just world, you'd be washing my shorts.\\
271 - Well, thanks, nevertheless.\\
272 - Last chance to see those tattoos.\\
273 - No thanks.\\
274 - I can make the Road Runner do jumping jacks.\\
275 - That was a fun apology.\\
276 - Yeah, I really thought I was the one who deserved a spanking.\\
277 - - So you'll call me? - Count on it.\\
278 - Hey, not that I really care, but, do you happen to know...\\
279 - ...who started that silly website?\\
280 - No. I just found it by Googling your name.\\
281 - Most women Google the guys they go out with, you know.\\
282 - Yeah, I've heard.\\
283 - - Well, I'll see you soon. - You better.\\
284 - Okay. That went well.\\
285 - Let's see. Who's next?\\
286 - Jake, why don't you go watch some TV. I need to talk to your dad.\\
287 - Is this about the firecrackers? What firecrackers?\\
288 - I'll go watch TV.\\
289 - Come in, sit down.\\
290 - Thanks. Listen...\\
291 - - Boy, this is tough. - Okay, okay, maybe...\\
292 - ...I can make it easier for you.\\
293 - Judith...\\
294 - ...I will always love you...\\
295 - ...but there's no going back for me.\\
296 - I've learned a lot about myself in the last year, and I'm growing.\\
297 - And... And I wanna keep on growing.\\
298 - I will always cherish what we had...\\
299 - ...but I have to fertilize my shrub.\\
300 - - What are you talking about? - It's Berta's metaphor.\\
301 - The... The bottom line is: I don't want to reconcile.\\
302 - Our marriage is over.\\
303 - Well, what makes you think I wanna reconcile?\\
304 - What did you wanna talk to me about?\\
305 - My mom wanted me to ask if Jake could spend a couple of weeks...\\
306 - ...with them this summer. - Oh, really?\\
307 - - That's what she wanted you to ask me? - Yes.\\
308 - You didn't tell her you loved me, you missed me?\\
309 - Well, I always tell her that to shut her up.\\
310 - And how the hell do you know what I talk to my mother about?\\
311 - Hey, look, Charlie's here.\\
312 - - Answer my question, Alan. - Hold on a second, Judith.\\
313 - - Charlie, what's wrong? - I've been making amends.\\
314 - Five amends in one afternoon.\\
315 - Well, technically, four. I had to fake the last one.\\
316 - - Charlie, Alan and I are talking. - Don't worry.\\
317 - I'll be out of your way as soon as I check on something.\\
318 - They all denied running the website...\\
319 - ...but at least I should have some good reviews now.\\
320 - Listen to this:\\
321 - "Charlie came over and apologized today, and, oh, what an apology it was.\\
322 - I take back everything nasty I ever said about him."\\
323 - Not bad, huh?\\
324 - Here's another one:\\
325 - "He apologized to you today?\\
326 - He apologized to me too."\\
327 - Okay, I have a bad feeling again.\\
328 - Alan, how do you know what I said to my mother?\\
329 - I didn't actually know. I surmised.\\
330 - I should go talk to Charlie.\\
331 - Hey, Dad, check it out. I can see my room on your computer.\\
332 - Okay, now I've got a bad feeling.\\
333 - My heart was in the right place, Rose.\\
334 - - I know. - All I wanted to do was apologize.\\
335 - - I had no ulterior motives. - I believe you.\\
336 - Thank you.\\
337 - Did I ever apologize to you?\\
338 - You mean, for our one-night stand that kind of, sort of broke my heart?\\
339 - Yeah, for that.\\
340 - No, not really.\\
341 - Okay, well, I am truly sorry.\\
342 - You're a wonderful person, and you deserved better.\\
343 - Thank you, Charlie.\\
344 - - That's sweet. - I mean it.\\
345 - - What's that? - Oh, this?\\
346 - It's one of those new web browser, e-mail gadgets.\\
347 - Cool.

2 - Hey, do you remember a girl named Jamie Eckelberry?\\
3 - - No. - Yeah, sure you do.\\
4 - She used to hang out at the house all the time.\\
5 - Oh, yeah. Eckelberry Hound.\\
6 - Not a name she was fond of.\\
7 - Hey, I didn't make it up. I just spread it around. What about her?\\
8 - Oh, she called the alumni association and tracked me down.\\
9 - How does that work? They let her sniff one of your sweaters?\\
10 - She e-mailed me. She's in town on business, and I invited her over.\\
11 - Great. I'll get out of your way. Just keep her off the good rug.\\
12 - Very funny. No. For your information, it's not a date.\\
13 - She's just a friend who has become very successful in her field.\\
14 - Oh, that's nice that she has a field to run around in.\\
15 - - It's getting old, Charlie. - In people years or dog years?\\
16 - Sorry. Oh, look. You remember Miss Hanrahan?\\
17 - - Sure. I had her for sophomore English. - I had her in the teachers' lounge.\\
18 - Oh, that's Jamie. Be nice.\\
19 - I'm always nice. Ask Miss Hanrahan.\\
20 - - I'm serious. - Relax. I'm just gonna say hello...\\
21 - ...scratch her behind the ear, and then I'm out of here.\\
22 - - You done with the dog jokes? - Yes.\\
23 - - Good. - I hope she looks fetching.\\
24 - Okay, I guess I had one more.\\
25 - - Alan. - Jamie.\\
26 - Do you remember how Stuart Negelman used to tell everybody you were gay?\\
27 - Don't remind me. I had one Boy George album...\\
28 - ...and suddenly I'm queen of the fairies.\\
29 - You'll be happy to know I ran into him in New York.\\
30 - - And? Knew it. - Gay.\\
31 - Okay, here we go.\\
32 - Two margaritas, and a rum and Diet Coke.\\
33 - - Thank you, Charlie. - You're welcome.\\
34 - - Cheers. - Cheers.\\
35 - So Stuart Negelman: Buttoned-down, or singing show tunes on a float?\\
36 - Very macho. Owns a gym in SoHo.\\
37 - Speaking of which, you look like you're in good shape.\\
38 - - I have kept up with the hacky sack. - Good for you.\\
39 - And you. I cannot get over what a beautiful woman you've become.\\
40 - - Oh, stop it. You're embarrassing me. - Too bad. It's true.\\
41 - Charlie, that's lovely. You still play.\\
42 - Just professionally.\\
43 - - You became a musician? - More a composer. Gotta pay the bills.\\
44 - Play the jingle you wrote for the feminine deodorant commercial.\\
45 - Okay.\\
46 - Fresh as a summer breeze Clean as a mountain spring\\
47 - No. You wrote that? I love that.\\
48 - Hey, hey, did I tell you that I was voted...\\
49 - ...Chiropractor of the Year by the San Fernando Valley Chiropractic Association?\\
50 - Oh, that's fantastic, Alan. You must be very proud.\\
51 - Well, it's not pride so much as the satisfaction I get from helping people.\\
52 - Carefree, so carefree\\
53 - What every woman wants to be\\
54 - Hey. Hey, you know what would be fun?\\
55 - A session of Dungeons & Dragons. Like the old days, you know?\\
56 - - Just the two of us. - Wow, I haven't played in years.\\
57 - Or we can go down to the beach and go for a swim.\\
58 - - I didn't bring a suit. - So my plan is working.\\
59 - You know, I think I'll take a rain check. Do you mind if I use your restroom?\\
60 - Down the hall on the right.\\
61 - Thank you.\\
62 - Don't you have enough women?\\
63 - No. Anyway, you said she was just an old friend.\\
64 - Well, that was before I saw her.\\
65 - Come on, I spent years laying the groundwork for this.\\
66 - And yet you never erected anything on the site.\\
67 - Because she didn't look like that then.\\
68 - Oh, shame on you, Alan Harper.\\
69 - Don't you know a woman is so much more than what's on the outside?\\
70 - She's a mountain spring, a summer breeze and I saw her first.\\
71 - What are you, 11?\\
72 - Come on. She's smart, she's beautiful, she's the kind of woman who...\\
73 - - You could never get? - Exactly.\\
74 - Well, if she's that important to you.\\
75 - She is, she is. Very much.\\
76 - - Okay, fine. I'm out of it. - Really?\\
77 - Happy birthday.\\
78 - Isn't that presumptuous? You think you can just give this woman as a gift?\\
79 - - Okay, forget it. - No, no. Happy birthday to me.\\
80 - Listen, I have an early meeting in the morning, so I should probably get going.\\
81 - Oh, no, no. The night is so young, and Charlie was just leaving.\\
82 - Yeah, if I don't start drinking now, I'll be up all night.\\
83 - I really have to get going. What about dinner tomorrow night?\\
84 - - That would be great. - Okay, terrific.\\
85 - Why don't the three of us meet at 7?\\
86 - The... The three of us?\\
87 - Oh, gee. Tomorrow night? I can't.\\
88 - Oh, come on, Charlie. I'm only in town for a few days.\\
89 - It wouldn't be the same without you. Right, Alan?\\
90 - That's... That's true. It would be different. But still good.\\
91 - No, no, no. You guys have a lot of catching up to do.\\
92 - I insist. Charlie, you have to come.\\
93 - Well, if it's okay with Alan...\\
94 - Of course.\\
95 - Okay, great. Then I will see you both tomorrow.\\
96 - - Okay. - Thank you.\\
97 - - Can't wait. - I know. Me too. Good night.\\
98 - Bye.\\
99 - So I'll get you something else for your birthday.\\
100 - You like hookers?\\
101 - Charlie, we agreed you're out. Now stay out.\\
102 - - All right, fine. I won't go. - Thank you.\\
103 - Wait! If you don't come, she'll think I told you not to come.\\
104 - There is that possibility.\\
105 - That's your plan. To make me look petty and insecure.\\
106 - Alan, I don't have to plan for that.\\
107 - Let me tell you something. You're coming with us, whether you like it or not.\\
108 - All right.\\
109 - Wait!\\
110 - - We should take your new Mercedes. - Fine.\\
111 - - I should drive it so she thinks it's mine. - Okay.\\
112 - Wait!\\
113 - She'll never believe I drive a Mercedes.\\
114 - You'll drive my old Volvo so that she thinks it's yours.\\
115 - Whatever. That just means you'll be sitting in the backseat alone.\\
116 - Wait!\\
117 - Charlie, I can't believe that after all these years, you're still single.\\
118 - Well...\\
119 - It's not that hard to believe.\\
120 - I'm a selfish, promiscuous, commitment-phobic man.\\
121 - Alan, on the other hand, is a very generous, loyal, one-woman kind of guy.\\
122 - Guilty.\\
123 - Why doesn't that surprise me?\\
124 - Now, what is surprising...\\
125 - ...is to hear a man be so honest and forthcoming about his flaws.\\
126 - Charlie, you are a real breath of fresh air.\\
127 - Guilty.\\
128 - But if you really want a breath of fresh air, take a lungful of Alan.\\
129 - He is a true gentleman.\\
130 - Oh, Alan's always been a gentleman.\\
131 - I remember one time we were kids. We were in my bedroom playing Stratego...\\
132 - ...and my blouse came unbuttoned, and Alan, instead of sneaking a peek...\\
133 - ...like a lot of guys would do, averted his eyes and said, "Jamie, bosom."\\
134 - Really. Is that true, Alan?\\
135 - Pretty much. We were playing Boggle, not Stratego.\\
136 - Well, there you go. A gentleman. A better man than I.\\
137 - Oh, don't put yourself down, Charlie. You seem like a wonderful man to me.\\
138 - Yeah, but you heard him. I'm better.\\
139 - Excuse me.\\
140 - I'll be right back. I think he wants to talk.\\
141 - You know, you are such a good brother.\\
142 - You have no idea.\\
143 - "Bosom"?\\
144 - Forget that. What the hell are you doing?\\
145 - What? I'm trying to make you look good. Turns out it's not that easy.\\
146 - You look like you're trying to make me look good...\\
147 - ...but you're making you look good.\\
148 - I don't know how, but that's the net result.\\
149 - - Alan, you're being ridiculous. - Am I? I think not.\\
150 - From the minute we walked in, you've been sabotaging me.\\
151 - - How? - How? Look at where I'm sitting.\\
152 - - What? You wanted to sit next to her. - Yeah, and you let me.\\
153 - And now you get to stare into her eyes, and I get to stare into her ear.\\
154 - What do you want from me? Wanna change seats?\\
155 - Sure. That won't look suspicious.\\
156 - I'm just trying to help, Alan. Well, how about that? I do have to pee.\\
157 - You wanna help me? Stop talking me up.\\
158 - - It's killing me. - Okay.\\
159 - Stop putting yourself down. That's killing me too.\\
160 - - Got it. - Just sit there and eat your dinner...\\
161 - ...and I'll play your game.\\
162 - Fine.\\
163 - You wanna shake on it?\\
164 - You're disgusting.\\
165 - Yeah, I'm disgusting.\\
166 - At least I'm not the one taking a squirt on my shoe.\\
167 - Let me tell you something about my brother.\\
168 - He puts himself down, but he is truly a wonderful man.\\
169 - I mean, here's a guy, single, good-Iooking, talented...\\
170 - - Well, l... - You're too modest.\\
171 - Talented, a ton of money.\\
172 - And what does he do when his brother and nephew need a place to live?\\
173 - Does he complain about us cramping his style? No.\\
174 - He opens up his home, and his heart.\\
175 - And frankly, I don't know which one is bigger.\\
176 - You are an incredible human being.\\
177 - Can we get the damn check, please?\\
178 - Wait till you meet Jake. He's a great kid.\\
179 - You're gonna love him. Right, Charlie?\\
180 - Don't oversell him, Alan. He mostly sits around and eats.\\
181 - What do you guys like to do together?\\
182 - Oh, we do all kinds of father-son things.\\
183 - - We go to the movies... - Where he sits and eats.\\
184 - And we also build models...\\
185 - You know, airplanes, and fly them off the deck.\\
186 - - That sounds like fun. - Oh, it is. Jake loves it.\\
187 - I mean, he is a great kid.\\
188 - I can't wait to meet him.\\
189 - How about tomorrow afternoon?\\
190 - - Tomorrow sounds great. - Good, good. It's a date.\\
191 - - So don't be late. - Or we'll have to wait.\\
192 - Oh, okay. Here we are.\\
193 - Thank you so much. I had a wonderful time.\\
194 - - I'll see you tomorrow. - Good night.\\
195 - Good night, Charlie.\\
196 - Good night.\\
197 - To the Batcave, Alfred.\\
198 - Go to hell.\\
199 - I was just sitting here. I didn't put her tongue in my mouth.\\
200 - You got tongue?\\
201 - Actually, looking back, it was probably mine.\\
202 - Oh, relax. I'm just screwing with you.\\
203 - Besides, you're the one who got the date.\\
204 - You had to pimp your kid out to do it, but you got there.\\
205 - Hey, hey, there is nothing wrong with bragging on my son.\\
206 - He's a reflection of me, and if that compensates...\\
207 - ...for some of my social clumsiness...\\
208 - And maybe rustles up a little tail.\\
209 - I am not pimping him out.\\
210 - Don't bark at me. I'm proud of you.\\
211 - Thank you. And make yourself scarce tomorrow.\\
212 - - I don't need any more of your help. - Fine. You're on your own.\\
213 - Now, hush up and drive Miss Daisy home.\\
214 - Okay, Sky Captain. Ready to go?\\
215 - I guess.\\
216 - See how he loves this?\\
217 - Pilot to copilot. Contact.\\
218 - What?\\
219 - - Contact. - Why are you talking like that?\\
220 - Just... Just start the engine.\\
221 - Here we go. Ready for liftoff?\\
222 - It's not a rocket ship, Dad.\\
223 - I know that, Jake.\\
224 - Hey, it actually works.\\
225 - Bring it up. Bring it up.\\
226 - - Okay. - Come on, Jake, up, up. It's...\\
227 - - Don't yell. - Give me that.\\
228 - - No, I'm doing it. - Well, then do it.\\
229 - I am.\\
230 - Is that it?\\
231 - No, go get it, and we'll patch her back up, like we always do.\\
232 - Can we just order a pizza and watch TV?\\
233 - Go get the plane.\\
234 - This sucks.\\
235 - "This sucks." Isn't he a hoot?\\
236 - He's great.\\
237 - So...\\
238 - ...here we are.\\
239 - Yep.\\
240 - I just cannot get over how much you've changed.\\
241 - - You like? - Yeah, me like. I mean... I mean, I like.\\
242 - So...\\
243 - ...where's Charlie?\\
244 - This is all I could find.\\
245 - - Guess who that is. - No way.\\
246 - - Way. - What was going on with your hair?\\
247 - It's called a Jeri curl.\\
248 - It was my Michael Jackson period.\\
249 - Who's the tall guy next to you?\\
250 - Oh, that's me, Jake.\\
251 - Oh, sorry.\\
252 - Well, at least you look like a girl now.\\
253 - Thank you.\\
254 - Was Dad your boyfriend?\\
255 - Oh, no, no. Jamie and I were just friends.\\
256 - Yeah, we were never that way.\\
257 - Are you that way now?\\
258 - - Why don't you go watch TV? - Finally.\\
259 - You know, Jamie, I've been thinking.\\
260 - You're single. I'm single. Well, we have an awful lot in common.\\
261 - I mean, there's no reason we couldn't try to be...\\
262 - ...you know, more than friends.\\
263 - Is that something you'd want?\\
264 - Well...\\
265 - - Hey. - Oh, darn.\\
266 - - Sorry to intrude. - That's okay. It's good to see you.\\
267 - I thought you were gonna be busy.\\
268 - I was. I went to a movie, shot some pool...\\
269 - ...bought a book, bought a shirt, drank a bucket of coffee, read the book.\\
270 - And then it occurred to me: "Hey, I have a home."\\
271 - Hey, Dad, can you microwave some popcorn for me?\\
272 - - Why can't you make it for yourself? - Remember what happened last time?\\
273 - You're old enough to make popcorn without starting a fire.\\
274 - Okay, I'll give it a shot.\\
275 - I'll be right back.\\
276 - So Jake's a great kid, isn't he?\\
277 - Yeah, I suppose.\\
278 - I would never say this to Alan, but I don't really care much for children.\\
279 - Well, the truth is, Alan's not too fond of him either.\\
280 - He feeds the kid and keeps a roof over his head...\\
281 - ...but there's no love lost between them.\\
282 - - Charlie, give it a rest. - Sorry?\\
283 - Why do you push me towards Alan...\\
284 - ...when it's obvious how much you want me?\\
285 - He's got a birthday coming up.\\
286 - Just tell me you want me.\\
287 - Go ahead, Charlie. Tell her.\\
288 - What? No, no. You two, with the Dungeons, the Dragons, the Boggle.\\
289 - You should be together.\\
290 - Clearly she wants you, so let's be grown-up, and I'll get out of the way...\\
291 - ...so the two pretty people can mate.\\
292 - No, no, no, no. You laid the foundation...\\
293 - ...and you should, you know, lay the rest of it.\\
294 - I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I am stepping aside...\\
295 - - No, no. I'm stepping aside. - No, no. I am.\\
296 - No, no, I'll step aside. I will clear the way.\\
297 - Will you both just shut up? You're ruining everything.\\
298 - - Nice going. - Nice going.\\
299 - - Say it, Charlie. - Say what?\\
300 - Say that slick, cool, Charlie Harper finally wants Eckelberry Hound.\\
301 - - You knew about that name? - That name scarred me for life.\\
302 - It's the reason I haven't eaten a carbohydrate since college.\\
303 - - Well, you do look good. - You're damn right I look good...\\
304 - ...you smug, shallow son of a bitch.\\
305 - I have spent years working and sweating and dreaming...\\
306 - ...about the day that I would be able to rub your smarmy nose in it.\\
307 - Okay, I'm getting mixed signals here.\\
308 - This is the signal, Charlie: You can't have this.\\
309 - Not now, not ever. Never, never, never!\\
310 - You know, I didn't make up the Eckelberry Hound thing.\\
311 - But he did spread it around. I was always your friend.\\
312 - Oh, please. I spent years throwing myself at you, friend.\\
313 - Playing stupid nerd games on my bed with my shirt open, buddy.\\
314 - Hoping that you would kiss me or touch me...\\
315 - ...or at least notice me as a woman, pal!\\
316 - - You knew your shirt was open? - Who do you think opened it?\\
317 - But I wasn't pretty enough for you. You wanted Donna DeMarco...\\
318 - ...or Maxine Chernikoff, just because they had big boobs...\\
319 - ...and no excess facial hair.\\
320 - Oh, yeah. Donna DeMarco, old Double D.\\
321 - Jamie, I had no idea. I am so sorry.\\
322 - But I was a stupid teenager. I guess I just didn't appreciate you then.\\
323 - I guess not.\\
324 - But that was a long time ago. I'm not a stupid teenager anymore.\\
325 - Do you think maybe you could forgive me, and maybe we could try again?\\
326 - Is that what you really want, Alan?\\
327 - Very much.\\
328 - Well, eat your heart out.\\
329 - You can never have this. Never, never, never!\\
330 - Well, I guess we know why she's still single.\\
331 - You're right, Dad. This is fun.\\
332 - Told you. It just takes a little while to get the hang of it.\\
333 - See if I can bring it in for a landing.\\
334 - Probably not a good idea. There's no real place to put it.\\
335 - What do you think Donna DeMarco's doing these days?
\subsection {Episode 13: Zejdz zmoich wlosow (Get off my hair)}
1 - Crap.\\
2 - Oopsie.\\
3 - Oh, Charlie!\\
4 - Okay, I guess I'll give you a call.\\
5 - Alrighty, that'd be great.\\
6 - Sounds good. Looking forward to it.\\
7 - Bye-bye now.\\
8 - Swell.\\
9 - Hey, Alan. You know how to say:\\
10 - "Please go faster," in Polish?\\
11 - - Funny language, isn't it? - Yeah, hilarious.\\
12 - The earthquake hit Sherman Oaks a lot harder than Malibu.\\
13 - - What earthquake? - What earthquake?\\
14 - About an hour ago. You didn't feel the house shaking?\\
15 - Unbelievable. You actually thought that was you?\\
16 - No, I thought it was her, you know, because of me.\\
17 - The good news is, unless they report it on Polish TV...\\
18 - ...I still get the credit.\\
19 - I'm thrilled for you. Anyway, Judith called.\\
20 - A pipe broke, soaked her living room carpet...\\
21 - ...and she's completely freaking out.\\
22 - Yeah, well, that's the difference between wife and ex-wife.\\
23 - With ex-wife, you don't even have to pretend to care.\\
24 - Well, I'm sorry. I can't be that callous.\\
25 - Have you even tried?\\
26 - She's the mother of my son. I'm concerned about her welfare.\\
27 - I told her she could stay here until repairs.\\
28 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up. Back up.\\
29 - When you told her, did you have, like, a sarcastic chuckle in your voice?\\
30 - Like, you know, " Yeah, right, Judith, you can stay here."\\
31 - - It's just for a couple of days. - A couple of days?\\
32 - Jack The Ripper just killed a couple of prostitutes.\\
33 - It was still wrong.\\
34 - - Do you want me to put her in a hotel? - Yeah, put her in a hotel.\\
35 - Put her in a space capsule. Put her in a catapult and see how far she flies.\\
36 - Charlie, I can't do that to her.\\
37 - Again, have you even tried?\\
38 - - She's afraid of another quake. - Well, what about what I'm afraid of?\\
39 - - What are you afraid of? - Oh, let's see. Large birds. Small bugs.\\
40 - Unplanned pregnancies. And your ex-wife living in my house.\\
41 - Come on, Charlie. She's just a small, frightened woman.\\
42 - There are no small, frightened women. That's a myth.\\
43 - Perpetrated by the large, angry women who secretly run the world.\\
44 - I think it would be healthy for Jake to see his mother and father...\\
45 - ...living together as friends.\\
46 - Oh, Alan, grow up.\\
47 - As long as he's got pizza with cheese and TV with 150 channels...\\
48 - ...he doesn't give a rat's ass what you guys do.\\
49 - Now that I think about it, neither do I.\\
50 - That had better be a big, pregnant bird covered with spiders.\\
51 - - I don't know how to thank you. - I'm glad you're okay.\\
52 - Charlie, I know this is a big imposition. I really appreciate you inviting me.\\
53 - I thought she should know this was your idea.\\
54 - Actually, I had several other ideas. Wanna hear them?\\
55 - Tell Jake you're here. I'll take your bags.\\
56 - Thank you, Alan. Thank you both.\\
57 - I promise I'll be out of here in a couple of days.\\
58 - - Judith, sit down. I've got it covered. - No. I can pitch in.\\
59 - Where do you keep the salad tongs? Wait, I got them.\\
60 - - Better use the wooden ones. - What's wrong with these?\\
61 - I use those whenever I drop my watch in the toilet.\\
62 - This is a regular occurrence?\\
63 - - You'd think I'd learn. - And you keep them in the kitchen?\\
64 - I used to hang them in the bathroom, but it freaked some chicks out.\\
65 - He's just kidding with you. Use the wooden ones.\\
66 - I don't want any salad.\\
67 - - Well, you have to have some. - Dad doesn't make me have salad.\\
68 - Alan?\\
69 - He's exaggerating. We have salad all the time.\\
70 - I just don't eat it.\\
71 - It's kind of our compromise.\\
72 - Okay. Fine. Your house, your rules.\\
73 - Technically, it's my house, his rules.\\
74 - Of course. Just have a little salad.\\
75 - So I spoke with the plumbing company...\\
76 - ...and they'll be there in the morning.\\
77 - So I'll drop off Jake and meet them on my way to work.\\
78 - - Thank you, Alan. - You're welcome.\\
79 - This is really weird.\\
80 - Why? Your mom and I may not be living together anymore, but we're still friends.\\
81 - I don't flip off my friends when I talk to them on the phone.\\
82 - Nice shooting.\\
83 - Two with one bullet.\\
84 - Well, if either of us did, in fact, do that, it was wrong.\\
85 - The important thing is we're making an effort to be nicer to each other.\\
86 - That's right. And your mom staying here is a good example of that.\\
87 - Very nicely put, Alan.\\
88 - If we leave now, we can be in Mexico in two hours.\\
89 - Hey.\\
90 - Hey.\\
91 - - Where's Alan? - Don't know.\\
92 - Mind if I join you?\\
93 - Sure.\\
94 - Thanks again for your hospitality.\\
95 - Don't mention it.\\
96 - You know, the TV in your room works.\\
97 - Oh, okay. Good to know.\\
98 - I just tucked Jake in. He loves you very much.\\
99 - Yeah. I love him too.\\
100 - You got cable, satellite, DVD. The whole shebang.\\
101 - Great.\\
102 - I'm surprised you're home on a Saturday night.\\
103 - What, with your fun bachelor lifestyle.\\
104 - Well, I got laid this morning.\\
105 - So I thought I'd kick back tonight.\\
106 - Oh, my. Well, isn't that something.\\
107 - - Nice girl? - I guess.\\
108 - She doesn't speak English.\\
109 - Well, hey. What are you guys doing?\\
110 - Just watching a little TV.\\
111 - - What's on? - I don't know. I just sat down.\\
112 - Oh, we've seen this movie before.\\
113 - - No, we didn't. - Sure we have.\\
114 - That guy's girlfriend turns out to be the murderer.\\
115 - Really? I did not know that.\\
116 - Oh, right. And she's not really a girl.\\
117 - I did not know that either.\\
118 - - When did we see this? - The first movie after Jake was born.\\
119 - Oh, right.\\
120 - It was so hard to leave him with the sitter.\\
121 - As soon as we got to the door, the sobbing started.\\
122 - Yeah, well, it was hard for me.\\
123 - You were such a softy.\\
124 - Alcohol.\\
125 - While you're up, you wanna make popcorn?\\
126 - - Sure. - No butter for me.\\
127 - Got it.\\
128 - - Hey, Charlie. - Hey, Rose.\\
129 - Anybody here?\\
130 - Good.\\
131 - Jeez.\\
132 - - I'm sorry. I thought you were asleep. - That's all right. Relax.\\
133 - - You sure? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine.\\
134 - - Where's Alan? - He took Jake to school...\\
135 - ...then went to meet with the plumber. - Right, right. Okay, I'll leave you to it.\\
136 - Charlie, wait.\\
137 - This is your home. Sit down. Drink your coffee.\\
138 - Okay.\\
139 - Oh, and I'm white trash.\\
140 - What are you, a farm animal?\\
141 - - What? - That's your brother's ex-wife out there.\\
142 - I know who she is.\\
143 - Oh, no, no. She's just staying here because of the earthquake.\\
144 - I'm not. I would never. I couldn't.\\
145 - Okay, I could. But I'm not.\\
146 - Yeah. That's what I used to stay about my stepbrother, Cousin Dewey.\\
147 - How's it going? Used to having your mom here?\\
148 - Nope. You?\\
149 - I'm still thinking Mexico.\\
150 - I liked it better when they weren't talking.\\
151 - Can't get away with much when they compare notes.\\
152 - It's hell.\\
153 - Jake, your mom wants to say goodbye.\\
154 - - She's leaving? - Just for a little while.\\
155 - - Where's she going? - Just out to dinner.\\
156 - You know, with a friend. I guess it's a date of some sort.\\
157 - She's going on a date?\\
158 - Of some sort.\\
159 - - And you're okay with this? - Oh, yeah.\\
160 - We talked about it. I think it's a sign of maturity that our relationship...\\
161 - ...has evolved enough that we can be honest that we see other people.\\
162 - Yeah, except the people you're seeing are in magazines and videos.\\
163 - Hey, I told you to stay out of my room.\\
164 - And that's not the point. If I were dating...\\
165 - ...she'd be just as supportive of me as I am of her.\\
166 - We're no longer ex-husband and ex-wife. We are friends getting on with our lives.\\
167 - She's happy and I'm happy.\\
168 - - Okay. I'm leaving. - Oh, have fun.\\
169 - Wow, I'm impressed.\\
170 - What happened to my jealous, tightly-wrapped, neurotic brother?\\
171 - Oh, there he is.\\
172 - Well, well, well.\\
173 - - Alan? - Oh, you remember me?\\
174 - What are you doing up so late?\\
175 - That's funny, I was about to ask you the same thing.\\
176 - Don't tell me you were waiting up for me?\\
177 - This isn't about what I was doing, Judith.\\
178 - No, no.\\
179 - This is about what you were doing until...\\
180 - ...now.\\
181 - I told you I had a date. You said you were fine with it.\\
182 - In theory, I was. In practice, I think we can both see I'm not.\\
183 - What did you want me to do, sit here and do nothing?\\
184 - Why not? It was good enough for me.\\
185 - You know what, you haven't changed at all.\\
186 - You're still the same neurotic, overbearing, control freak I threw out.\\
187 - Neurotic? Maybe. Overbearing? Perhaps. But you know what?\\
188 - You're not gonna throw me out, because I have changed.\\
189 - Tonight, I'm leaving you.\\
190 - As it turns out, a distinction without a difference.\\
191 - Fine, Alan. Suit yourself.\\
192 - Where's Dad?\\
193 - - He's at our house. - How come?\\
194 - Well, we decided we needed a little time apart.\\
195 - Isn't that why you got a divorce?\\
196 - It's hard to explain, Jake.\\
197 - - Do I get any presents this time? - No.\\
198 - What happens now? You gonna live here?\\
199 - - No. - Are you gonna buy a new house?\\
200 - No.\\
201 - Wanna go to Mexico with me and Uncle Charlie?\\
202 - - Good morning. - Good morning.\\
203 - Where's Alan?\\
204 - - Well, it's a long story. - You're not gonna believe it.\\
205 - Hi. I just stopped by to say I told you so.\\
206 - I told you so.\\
207 - Oh, come on, Alan. If you can't laugh at yourself, at least let me do it.\\
208 - What do you want, Charlie?\\
209 - Well...\\
210 - ...first of all, I'd like to know exactly how you managed...\\
211 - ...to let your ex-wife throw you out of my house.\\
212 - Because that's the first thing people are gonna ask when I tell this story.\\
213 - She didn't throw me out, I left.\\
214 - Oh, good, there's a twist. You see, that's what makes a good story.\\
215 - - Leave me alone, Charlie. - Oh, lighten up.\\
216 - You tried to be friends with the woman who wrecked your life and failed.\\
217 - No damage done. Just a little personal humiliation...\\
218 - ...and at this point in your life, how would you even notice that?\\
219 - - Are you finished? - Did I mention I told you so?\\
220 - - Twice. - Counting this one?\\
221 - - Okay, I'm finished. - Thank you.\\
222 - Now, on to new business.\\
223 - Currently, you and I are sitting in a house that belongs to neither one of us.\\
224 - While your ex-wife is sitting in the house that belongs to me.\\
225 - - You see the paradox? - I can't go back there, Charlie.\\
226 - She's running around, having a great time, and I've got nothing.\\
227 - - You've got me. - Drop dead.\\
228 - Okay, now you got nothing.\\
229 - It would be different if Judith and I were both dating.\\
230 - True, but moot.\\
231 - - Unless... - What unless?\\
232 - - It's stupid. - Stupider than this?\\
233 - Come on. What do you got?\\
234 - Well, what if you were dating?\\
235 - - But I'm not. - But if you looked like you were?\\
236 - Oh, you mean? No, no way.\\
237 - I'm not gonna let you fix me up with one of your bimbo girlfriends.\\
238 - Okay, forget it.\\
239 - She'd have to be really pretty.\\
240 - Like a 10. And young. Like a 20.\\
241 - - Anything else? - And smart.\\
242 - And a sense of humor is important. Well-read, good with kids...\\
243 - ...non-smoking, of course. Oh, and easy on the piercings.\\
244 - Nothing south of the equator.\\
245 - You're mighty picky for a guy with an adult newsstand in his sock drawer.\\
246 - Okay. Homework is taken care of. He's taking a shower.\\
247 - You may wanna check in on him, make sure he's not goofing around.\\
248 - - Where are you going? - Oh, I have dinner plans.\\
249 - - Really? - Yeah. Hard to believe, huh?\\
250 - - I didn't say that, I'm happy for you. - Well, thank you.\\
251 - Again, I'm sorry I overreacted the other night.\\
252 - I want us to have the kind of friendship that can be mutually supportive.\\
253 - - Me too. - You'll go out, I'll go out.\\
254 - Right. So is this someone you've been seeing for a while?\\
255 - Yeah, a while. But, you know, not exclusive.\\
256 - I don't wanna get tied down.\\
257 - Oh, that must be Camille.\\
258 - - She picks you up? - Well, what can I say?\\
259 - It's a new world, Judith.\\
260 - Hey, wow.\\
261 - You are so good for my ego.\\
262 - - Hi, Charlie. - Hi, Camille.\\
263 - - Hello, I'm Judith. - You're Alan's ex?\\
264 - Wow, I didn't expect you to be so young looking.\\
265 - - Thank you. - I mean, you have such beautiful skin...\\
266 - ...for the mother of an 11 -year-old.\\
267 - Oh, thank you.\\
268 - Okay. Well, we should get going.\\
269 - It was nice meeting you.\\
270 - I just hope I look half as good as her when I'm that old.\\
271 - I'm betting you will.\\
272 - Man, I don't know how he does it.\\
273 - I made a big play for her, nothing.\\
274 - - She's so young. - Yeah, some guys like that.\\
275 - I gotta hand it to you, Judith.\\
276 - You were very mature.\\
277 - I guess that's because you're a very mature woman.\\
278 - Yeah, thanks. Jake, say goodbye to Mommy!\\
279 - She's going home!\\
280 - - Good morning, everybody. - Good morning.\\
281 - Sounds like somebody cracked open the sock drawer last night.\\
282 - I'm going to ignore that because I am in such a good mood. Charlie, thank you.\\
283 - Your ex-wife breaking the sound barrier on her way out was thanks enough.\\
284 - I don't even care about that anymore. That was the best date of my life.\\
285 - I mean, Camille is smart and funny. And, oh, boy, talk about pretty.\\
286 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I bet she rocked your world in the sack, huh?\\
287 - What? No, no. Get your mind out of the gutter. We just talked all night...\\
288 - ...and then there was a little kissing. Maybe on our next date, who knows?\\
289 - But for now, I'm just gonna play it slow.\\
290 - - You're playing it slow? - Yeah.\\
291 - I don't know where you found Camille, but she's a bit old-fashioned.\\
292 - She's not like the ones you usually go out with.\\
293 - No, I guess not.\\
294 - A thousand dollars a night and he's playing it slow.\\
295 - You're a good brother, Charlie.\\
296 - He's playing it slow.\\
297 - She demanded cash.\\
298 - He's playing it slow.
\subsection {Episode 14: Those Big Pink Things with Coconut}
1 - - Hey, buddy. - Hi, Uncle Charlie.\\
2 - - Ready for a fun weekend? - He's not gonna have a fun weekend.\\
3 - Charlie, he's gonna study for a history test on Monday.\\
4 - Well, if believing that gets you back in your car, I'll play along.\\
5 - - Where's Alan? - He's not here.\\
6 - Really? I told him I was on my way.\\
7 - That might be why he's not here.\\
8 - Okay, I'll just have to go over everything with you.\\
9 - I'm gonna visit my parents.\\
10 - I won't pick Jake up till Wednesday. Alan has to take him to school.\\
11 - Monday is soccer practice.\\
12 - He has his math tutor and his guitar teacher on Tuesday...\\
13 - Hang on. Hang on.\\
14 - Oh, hi, Judith.\\
15 - Alan, why are you avoiding me?\\
16 - - I'm not avoiding you as much as... - Hiding.\\
17 - - Thank you. - Why were you hiding?\\
18 - Why does the wounded gazelle hide from the stealthy jaguar?\\
19 - Why does the helpless piglet hide from ravenous wolverine?\\
20 - Animal Planet.\\
21 - You learn a lot.\\
22 - We need to talk about your pain-in-the-ass mother.\\
23 - You know, I would love to...\\
24 - ...but as Charlie told you, I'm not here. - I let her take Jake out to dinner.\\
25 - She brought him home and she lectured me for 15 minutes about his dirty ears.\\
26 - - Fifteen minutes, huh? - How long is this gonna take?\\
27 - Like I'm a bad parent.\\
28 - Let her try and get a Q-Tip in a squirming 11 -year-old boy's ear.\\
29 - Mom didn't believe in Q-Tips. She had a squirt gun.\\
30 - You know, the woolly meerkat of western Africa...\\
31 - ...buries her cubs up to their necks and licks their ears clean.\\
32 - What? It seemed apropos.\\
33 - If she wants to spend time with her grandson...\\
34 - ...she needs to back off. - Okay, I'll tell her.\\
35 - - Thank you. - I'll tell Alan you stopped by.\\
36 - Okay, Lewis and Clark explored what?\\
37 - - I don't remember. - You just read that chapter.\\
38 - Yeah, but Lewis and Clark was a long time ago.\\
39 - Thanks for the ride, Sally.\\
40 - And for getting me home too.\\
41 - - Why is that funny? - It's not.\\
42 - Mustang Sally, giddyup.\\
43 - Now, Lewis and Clark.\\
44 - Face it, Dad, I'm just not good at history.\\
45 - Really? What did you have for lunch yesterday?\\
46 - A pizza square. Actually, two pizza squares, a ice cream sandwich...\\
47 - ...and a bag of Skittles. - Okay, see, that's history.\\
48 - And a Ding Dong and a diet root beer.\\
49 - - Great. - Wait. It wasn't a Ding Dong.\\
50 - - It was a Ho Ho. - Got it.\\
51 - You know what I like? Those big, pink things with coconut.\\
52 - - Snow Balls? - Exactly. Can you still get those?\\
53 - Yeah, but not at the supermarket. You have to go to 7-Eleven.\\
54 - Thank you.\\
55 - Alan, will you drive me to 7-Eleven?\\
56 - No, we are trying to study.\\
57 - All right, I'll hoof it.\\
58 - - Can I bring you back something? - Ding Dong.\\
59 - Who's there?\\
60 - I'm trying to get him ready for his test.\\
61 - Sorry. Sorry. You go ahead. I'll pretend I'm not here.\\
62 - Okay, Lewis and Clark explored what?\\
63 - Louisiana Purchase.\\
64 - - Right. - I knew that.\\
65 - Yeah, but Uncle Charlie buzzed first.\\
66 - And I'm still buzzed.\\
67 - - Okay, give me another question. - All right.\\
68 - Seward's Folly is another name for?\\
69 - - Jake? - Alaska.\\
70 - - Very good. - Oh, I was gonna say Mrs. Seward.\\
71 - Okay, the score is 1 to 1.\\
72 - Now that you mention it...\\
73 - ...an Eskimo Pie would go down pretty good right now.\\
74 - Alan, will you drive me to 7-Eleven?\\
75 - No, next question:\\
76 - - The War of 1812... - 1812.\\
77 - - No. - 1813.\\
78 - Let me finish the question.\\
79 - The War of 1812 was fought against whom?\\
80 - - The British. - Very good, 2 to 1, Jake.\\
81 - - Yes. - No fair. My buzzer's broken.\\
82 - - Next question. - Let me try yours.\\
83 - See? His works.\\
84 - All right, contestants, we are at the final round.\\
85 - The questions are worth more.\\
86 - - And the answers are harder. - True.\\
87 - - Wait for a question. - Okay.\\
88 - Here we go. Name three changes in American life...\\
89 - ...brought about by the industrial revolution.\\
90 - Populations shift to cities, employment moving from farms to factories, and...\\
91 - - Yes? - Sorry, I hit it by mistake.\\
92 - - Settlement of the West. - That's correct.\\
93 - - You are our new champion. - Yes.\\
94 - Settlement of the West.\\
95 - - You see, Jake? You know this stuff. - Yeah, I guess I do.\\
96 - - Trust me, you are gonna do great. - Yeah, thanks, Dad.\\
97 - You're welcome. Now go get ready for bed.\\
98 - - I'll be there in a minute to tuck you in. - Okey-dokey.\\
99 - Oh, I gotta get a security camera.\\
100 - Where's your brother? I wanna talk to him.\\
101 - - He's not here. - Oh, really?\\
102 - No, he's actually not here.\\
103 - You know what his ex-wife said to me?\\
104 - Mom, please go away.\\
105 - She never calls me "Mom," but that was the gist of it.\\
106 - I took Jake out to dinner...\\
107 - - You're pretending not to understand me. - Right.\\
108 - And all I did was suggest to Judith...\\
109 - ...that she might wanna pay a little more attention to her son's ear hygiene.\\
110 - Not only was she completely unappreciative...\\
111 - ...but she had the nerve to denigrate how I raised my sons.\\
112 - Yeah, because we turned out so well.\\
113 - Excuse me, but whatever emotional issues you think you have...\\
114 - ...I kept your ears spotless.\\
115 - I remember. You used the same Super Soaker...\\
116 - ...to keep us off the furniture.\\
117 - Ladies and gentlemen...\\
118 - ...presenting noted scholar and A-student, Jake Harper.\\
119 - - You got an A? - I got an A.\\
120 - - All right. Way to go. - Congratulations, Jake.\\
121 - - Thanks. It's my first A this year. - Really? Well, it's none too soon then.\\
122 - - Mom, leave it alone. - I'm not saying anything.\\
123 - I think it's wonderful. Did anybody else in your class get an A?\\
124 - Almost everybody. Why?\\
125 - Oh, I was just curious as to how hard the test was.\\
126 - It doesn't matter, Mom. Still an A.\\
127 - An A is very nice. I just don't know why you're making such a big fuss...\\
128 - ...if they're just handing them out like rubella vaccinations.\\
129 - I don't know. It looks like a pretty hard test to me.\\
130 - - No, it was easy. - That's because you studied.\\
131 - - You earned that A. - Wendy Chow got an A-plus.\\
132 - You hear that? Wendy Chow got an A-plus.\\
133 - Wendy Chow is a freak of nature.\\
134 - She cloned a goldfish for the science fair.\\
135 - We can't compare Jake to her.\\
136 - Who should we compare him to then? The paste eaters and the unibrows?\\
137 - Darling, if you set the bar low in childhood...\\
138 - ...he may never reach the heights he's capable of.\\
139 - You're condemning him to a life of failure and mediocrity.\\
140 - Is that what you want, Jake? A life of failure and mediocrity?\\
141 - No.\\
142 - You see? He may well be sharper than you give him credit for.\\
143 - I'm gonna go to my room.\\
144 - I am putting that A-paper up on the fridge.\\
145 - Wow. Texas used to be a separate country.\\
146 - Why did we change that?\\
147 - Not now, Charlie. How dare you?\\
148 - - Excuse me? - He worked hard on that test.\\
149 - He was finally feeling good about himself and his abilities...\\
150 - ...and in 30 seconds you managed to suck...\\
151 - ...every bit of self-esteem out of him. You're like a...\\
152 - - A self-esteem sucker. - Yes, exactly.\\
153 - Alan, I was just having a conversation with the boy.\\
154 - No. No, you don't have conversations. You...\\
155 - Suck self-esteem.\\
156 - I would've gotten it.\\
157 - Mom, I am sorry, but I don't think I want you around my son anymore.\\
158 - - What? - You heard me.\\
159 - You will not do to him...\\
160 - ...what you did to me and Charlie. - What did I do to you?\\
161 - What did you do? What did she...? Charlie, tell her.\\
162 - Why tell her when we can show her?\\
163 - I see. So you're both turning against me.\\
164 - Oh, I turned a long time ago.\\
165 - Alan's just catching up.\\
166 - All right, fine.\\
167 - If I'm not welcome here...\\
168 - ...I'll leave.\\
169 - My own sons are throwing me out.\\
170 - Goodbye.\\
171 - This isn't over, is it?\\
172 - No, we're screwed.\\
173 - Let me guess. Mom?\\
174 - She's been calling all morning. I'm starting to feel guilty.\\
175 - You can't show weakness, Alan. She'll sense it.\\
176 - Like the hooded cobra senses the rapid heartbeat...\\
177 - ...of a panic-stricken kangaroo rat.\\
178 - But don't you feel even a bit sorry for her?\\
179 - Does the mongoose feel sorry for the wounded garden-snake?\\
180 - Does the dingo feel sorry for the slow-crawling Australian baby?\\
181 - - You guys okay? - Oh, yeah, yeah.\\
182 - We're fine. Why?\\
183 - Your mother just called me. She said she's been trying to reach you...\\
184 - ...all morning and she's very worried.\\
185 - - We're fine, Rose. - We're not talking to her.\\
186 - Why? Because she tried to encourage Jake to live up to his potential?\\
187 - That's a reason to throw her out and slam the door in her face?\\
188 - How could you be so cruel to your own mother?\\
189 - And the dingo has found another Australian baby.\\
190 - Rose, that's not what happened.\\
191 - We were protecting Jake.\\
192 - How? By ripping his only grandmother out of his life?\\
193 - - He has another grandmother. - Oh, right, the Sacramento pill-freak.\\
194 - Is that what she told you?\\
195 - For the record, Jake's other grandmother...\\
196 - ...is out of rehab and doing just fine.\\
197 - We appreciate your concern, Rose. Thanks for stopping by.\\
198 - So now you're just gonna slam the door in my face?\\
199 - Pretty much.\\
200 - Not as satisfying with a glass door.\\
201 - Okay, first she starts with the phone calls...\\
202 - ...then she sent Rose over. I wonder what's next.\\
203 - I don't know, but I'm betting it'll be something big.\\
204 - Right. I understand, it's terrible.\\
205 - Okay, let me see what I can do about it.\\
206 - How in the hell did your mother get my cell phone number?\\
207 - Sometimes, when the nest is threatened...\\
208 - ... the seemingly docile creatures have been known to eat their own young.\\
209 - Hey, did Mom call you at the office today?\\
210 - No, she call here?\\
211 - - No, it's been pretty quiet. - Yeah, maybe too quiet.\\
212 - And here we see the female praying-mantis...\\
213 - ... after copulation, devouring her mate.\\
214 - Your ex-wife back from her parents'?\\
215 - Yeah, I dropped Jake off with her this afternoon.\\
216 - Apparently her mom had a little relapse with the pills.\\
217 - - Oh, yeah? - They found her in pajamas...\\
218 - ...driving an imaginary car through the home and garden section of Wal-Mart.\\
219 - How could they tell if she was driving an imaginary car?\\
220 - She rolled down the window to ask for directions to the pharmacy.\\
221 - - Here we witness the... - Not Mom.\\
222 - Hello? Yeah, this is Charlie Harper.\\
223 - What? I see.\\
224 - Okay, then. Thanks for letting me know.\\
225 - - Who was that? - St. John's Hospital.\\
226 - Our mother checked in this evening with chest pains and breathing difficulties.\\
227 - - Oh, my God. - Ever wonder who was the first guy...\\
228 - ...to put pineapple on pizza?\\
229 - I bet he was gay.\\
230 - - Charlie... - No straight guy is gonna say:\\
231 - "You know what this pizza could use? A pineapple ring."\\
232 - God bless him. It's good.\\
233 - Charlie, is Mom okay?\\
234 - Of course she's okay. She's faking.\\
235 - - How can you be so sure? - It really doesn't make any difference.\\
236 - If she is faking and we rush to see her, she wins.\\
237 - If she's not faking, and we ignore her...\\
238 - ...she complains about what horrible sons we are...\\
239 - ...and she still wins.\\
240 - What if she's not faking and she dies?\\
241 - Well, look at you, Mr. Glass Half-Full.\\
242 - I can't help thinking this is all my fault.\\
243 - I told Mom she couldn't see her grandson and she had a heart attack.\\
244 - Alan, you forget who you're dealing with.\\
245 - This woman buried two husbands and divorced two others.\\
246 - She's lived through wars, riots, earthquakes.\\
247 - Only way you're gonna bring her down is with a stake dipped in holy water.\\
248 - Here we are.\\
249 - Oh, my God. Mommy?\\
250 - Excuse me?\\
251 - - Are you family? - Yeah, we're her sons.\\
252 - Is she gonna be okay? Tell me she's gonna be okay.\\
253 - Your mother's gonna be fine. I can't find a thing wrong with her.\\
254 - - Are you sure? - As sure as I can be.\\
255 - Her heart's fine. Lungs are fine.\\
256 - Blood chemistry's good. EEG's normal.\\
257 - - Oh, thank God. - That bitch.\\
258 - Yeah, tell me about it.\\
259 - Excuse me. I'm gonna tell her she can go home.\\
260 - - Oh, no, please, let us. - Yeah, we owe her that.\\
261 - Suit yourself. Oh, better hurry, though.\\
262 - The nurses are circulating a"do not revive" petition.\\
263 - - You said there was nothing wrong. - It's a big hospital.\\
264 - Things happen.\\
265 - What do we do now?\\
266 - Don't worry. I got a plan.\\
267 - Oh, great, he has a plan.\\
268 - Mom?\\
269 - Charlie? Is that you?\\
270 - Alan's here too, Mom.\\
271 - - Hi, Mom. - Boys, you didn't have to come.\\
272 - Are you kidding? Of course we did.\\
273 - - Right, Alan? - Of course.\\
274 - Tell us what happened.\\
275 - I came home this afternoon, alone.\\
276 - I was walking up the stairs...\\
277 - ...alone.\\
278 - And I had trouble breathing...\\
279 - ...so I drove myself to the hospital...\\
280 - ...alone.\\
281 - - Well, why did you drive yourself? - Oh, I didn't wanna bother...\\
282 - ...the ambulance people.\\
283 - Why didn't you call us?\\
284 - Oh, you both made it very clear how you feel about me.\\
285 - Now, that's not fair.\\
286 - Just tell Jake...\\
287 - ...his Grandmommy loves him very much.\\
288 - Don't talk like that.\\
289 - You can tell him yourself, after the operation.\\
290 - What operation?\\
291 - Relax. Relax. Quadruple bypasses are routine these days.\\
292 - - Quadruple? - Yeah, yeah.\\
293 - You got four clogged arteries. Right, Alan?\\
294 - Right, the doctor said it's lucky you came when you did.\\
295 - Another few days and you'd have been flopping around on the floor like a carp.\\
296 - It's no big deal, Mom. They crack open you open...\\
297 - ...flush out the pipes, sew you back up and you're good as new.\\
298 - Except, you know, for the big, gnarly scar on your chest.\\
299 - They're prepping the OR.\\
300 - We got the best surgeon available.\\
301 - He's young but really sharp.\\
302 - And well-respected in his own country.\\
303 - Well, all right.\\
304 - If it has to be done, it has to be done.\\
305 - I love you, boys.\\
306 - If the worst should happen...\\
307 - ...please remember that.\\
308 - - Yeah. Sure. - Of course.\\
309 - Oh, my God, Evelyn Are you all right?\\
310 - Oh, Judith, is that you?\\
311 - Yes, I'm right here. Jake's here too.\\
312 - Oh, Jake. Come to Grandmommy, darling.\\
313 - I'm sorry you feel bad, Grandma.\\
314 - Oh, Grandmommy's feeling much better now that her little man is here.\\
315 - - I made you a get-well card. - Oh, isn't that nice.\\
316 - Gift shop wasn't open?\\
317 - You said you had a plan. Well, guess what? It was a bad plan.\\
318 - - Alan, calm down. - The plan sucked.\\
319 - - Don't worry. - Don't worry?\\
320 - She's expecting a quadruple bypass. What are we gonna do?\\
321 - We're gonna get her one.\\
322 - Must be someone around here who can handle a rib spreader.\\
323 - - Charlie, that's insane. - You're right.\\
324 - There's no time. Better scrub up.\\
325 - She had to drive herself to the hospital? What is wrong with you two?\\
326 - - Relax, Judith. She's not sick. - What?\\
327 - She's faking and we called her bluff, and then she called ours.\\
328 - So now, we're gonna have to cut her open.\\
329 - You want in?\\
330 - Hey, guess what? After Grandma's operation...\\
331 - ...she's gonna take me to Magic Mountain, okay?\\
332 - Yeah, yeah, that's okay. We're gonna have to tell her.\\
333 - You sure? We don't need to do the bypass.\\
334 - All we do is put her out, slice her open.\\
335 - - The scar will sell it. - The truth, Charlie.\\
336 - Doesn't have to be a big scar.\\
337 - Okay, doctor, let's schedule this as quickly as possible.\\
338 - Oh, great. I'll be here.\\
339 - Hello, boys.\\
340 - - What are you doing? - lf I'm going to have to have surgery...\\
341 - ...I want my own doctor.\\
342 - Mom, you don't really need a surgeon.\\
343 - Oh, but I do.\\
344 - Your quadruple bypass story makes the perfect cover...\\
345 - ...for a little nip tuck.\\
346 - No turkey neck for Grandmommy, right?\\
347 - About Jake. I told him I'd take him to Magic Mountain...\\
348 - ...but you know how I feel about direct sunlight.\\
349 - Yeah, and wolfbane.\\
350 - You'll take him for me, won't you, Charlie?\\
351 - - Sure, Mom. - I'll make it up to him...\\
352 - ...by taking him out for a haircut and some decent clothes.\\
353 - - He'll like that. - Sure, Mom.\\
354 - Maybe when his mother sees how nice he could look...\\
355 - ...she'll take the hint and stop dressing him like a tackling dummy.\\
356 - Oh, the food here is just dreadful.\\
357 - So why don't you boys run across the street...\\
358 - ...and get me a nice ahi tuna...\\
359 - Charlie, what in God's name are you doing?\\
360 - Just practicing.\\
361 - The worker bees, or drones...\\
362 - ... live a life of utter devotion to their queen.\\
363 - You had a plan.\\
364 - From birth, these industrious yet mindless creatures...\\
365 - ... slave away to fulfill the queen 's every need.\\
366 - "Don't worry, Alan. I have a plan."\\
367 - Until finally they reach the end of their brief lifespan and die...\\
368 - ... becoming food and building materials for the rest of the hive.\\
369 - Alan, where's my sandwich?\\
370 - Coming, Mom.\\
371 - A cruel existence? Perhaps. But that's life on the Animal Planet.
\subsection {Episode 15: Smell the Umbrella Stand}
1 - Well, this is gonna be a sucky weekend.\\
2 - Try spending it with an 11 -year-old who does nothing but complain.\\
3 - You mean me?\\
4 - Boy, no wonder they got to write your name in your underwear.\\
5 - What am I supposed to do?\\
6 - - Watch TV. - There's nothing on.\\
7 - - Play a video game. - I've played them all.\\
8 - - Read a book. - Yeah, right.\\
9 - Who's the moron now?\\
10 - Okay. Here's a rainy day activity.\\
11 - There are 12 college basketball games on this weekend.\\
12 - Dial this number, and ask for Coop.\\
13 - Tell him you're calling for Mr. Bojingles and write down everything he tells you.\\
14 - Do I get to make some picks this time?\\
15 - - You got money? - lf you pay me what you owe me.\\
16 - Well, you're getting an education here. That's priceless.\\
17 - - What's going on? - Just talking about picking colleges.\\
18 - - I like Duke. - Over Wake Forest?\\
19 - Got a hunch.\\
20 - You've got him thinking about college?\\
21 - You're welcome. So how'd it go at the doctor?\\
22 - Sit down, I have to tell you something.\\
23 - What?\\
24 - The doctor wants me to have a procedure.\\
25 - - What kind of procedure? - He says I'm fine...\\
26 - ...and it's routine, but I'm really freaked out about it.\\
27 - What procedure?\\
28 - A colonoscopy.\\
29 - Oh, jeez, Alan, that's no big deal.\\
30 - They're just gonna shove a camera up your ass.\\
31 - Okay, in all future references to this procedure...\\
32 - ...can we please use the word "glide" or "slide"...\\
33 - ...as opposed to "shove."\\
34 - Don't sweat it. Every guy eventually has to get one of those.\\
35 - - It's strictly a fact-finding mission. - You've had one?\\
36 - No, you crazy?\\
37 - But I hear there's nothing to worry about. It's a tiny little camera.\\
38 - In the old days, they'd send a sketch artist up there.\\
39 - Besides, you're unconscious.\\
40 - That's what I'm worried about. I'll be in a very vulnerable position.\\
41 - - They could do anything. - Alan, it's not a pirate ship.\\
42 - Just relax. It'll be over before you know it.\\
43 - Yeah. I'll bet that's what they say on pirate ships.\\
44 - - Damn it. - What?\\
45 - The sink's stopped up again.\\
46 - That kid doesn't know the difference between the garbage and the drain.\\
47 - - What do you want? He's 11. - That's no excuse.\\
48 - If he can't tell which hole is which at his age, he's headed for trouble.\\
49 - How about that?\\
50 - Oh, God, I had the worst nightmares.\\
51 - Pirate ships?\\
52 - Full-service gas stations.\\
53 - I fail to see the connection.\\
54 - Cold steel nozzles going into openings.\\
55 - Dipsticks being pulled out.\\
56 - Do I have to draw you a picture?\\
57 - You know what?\\
58 - You need to get your mind off this colonoscopy.\\
59 - Come on! Get in there, you sucker!\\
60 - Easy for you to say.\\
61 - How about this?\\
62 - How about we hop in the car and go to Vegas for a couple of days?\\
63 - Just like that? What about Jake?\\
64 - Oh, yeah, Jake.\\
65 - Okay, how about this, we get him a fake mustache and a hat...\\
66 - ...and tell everybody his mother was a heavy smoker.\\
67 - - I don't think so. - We can still bring him...\\
68 - ...come on, it's the perfect solution. The kid's bored...\\
69 - ...and you're all puckered up over this colonoscopy thing.\\
70 - It just won't go in.\\
71 - - Well, it is a three-day weekend. - Exactly.\\
72 - And I got 2 grand in my pocket that's itching to turn into $ 12 and a hangover.\\
73 - Come on, we can be there in like four hours.\\
74 - Unless you drive, in which case I'm not going.\\
75 - Perfect, now I can't get it out.\\
76 - You know what? Why not? One way or another...\\
77 - ...I'm gonna get reamed. I might as well enjoy a free buffet.\\
78 - Great. Go grab a toothbrush and we'll hit the road.\\
79 - Pinky? Berta.\\
80 - Order a keg and call the gang, I got the house until Tuesday.\\
81 - Okay, we're gonna need two rooms.\\
82 - One for Alan Harper and son...\\
83 - ...and one for Charlie Harper and a cocktail waitress to be named later.\\
84 - No, I don't want connecting rooms.\\
85 - Weren't you listening?\\
86 - In fact, put mine on a different floor.\\
87 - Come on, let's go.\\
88 - Now, what's playing in your showroom?\\
89 - Nude Legends on Ice. Sweet.\\
90 - Okay, this may sound like a dumb question...\\
91 - ...but is it a family show?\\
92 - Well, what if the kid had a mustache?\\
93 - All right. He'll just have to stay in the room and watch scrambled porn.\\
94 - - You could help me, you know. - No, you're doing okay.\\
95 - - Where's your clean underwear? - I'm wearing it.\\
96 - - That's all you brought for the weekend? - It's only three days.\\
97 - All right, we'll pick some up there.\\
98 - They'd last five days if I turn them inside out.\\
99 - What's going on? Aren't you ready?\\
100 - - I'm packing Jake. - For what, college?\\
101 - - What the hell's this? - So he can go swimming.\\
102 - - Where? - They have pools in Vegas, Charlie.\\
103 - Why don't you bring a frying pan, they got kitchens too.\\
104 - - Let's see. Sport jacket. - He doesn't need a sport jacket.\\
105 - What if we take him someplace nice?\\
106 - Take him someplace nice?\\
107 - Alan, if I wanna throw away money, I'll play keno.\\
108 - - Can I gamble in Vegas? - No.\\
109 - - Why am I going? - Because all the kennels are full.\\
110 - Now, come on. Let's go.\\
111 - - Charlie, I haven't packed myself yet. - What've you been doing?\\
112 - I changed the phone message...\\
113 - ...to tell people we'd be out of town, I put together a first aid kit...\\
114 - ...I turned the fridge thermostat down, because it doesn't have to be cold...\\
115 - ...I called the paper and stopped delivery...\\
116 - ...and I erased an old Mad Libs book...\\
117 - ...so we'd have something to entertain us in the car.\\
118 - - Mad Libs, huh? - Yeah.\\
119 - Let me see that.\\
120 - Go get packed!\\
121 - Wait until you see Vegas, Jake.\\
122 - There's action everywhere you look, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\\
123 - How does that help me?\\
124 - I can't gamble, and I have to be in bed at 9:30.\\
125 - Hey, when we go to Disneyland do I complain that I hate...\\
126 - ...every aspect of the entire experience? - Yeah.\\
127 - Well, then you know how irritating it is.\\
128 - - Blackjack. - That's it?\\
129 - Yep. You owe me another dollar.\\
130 - - This stinks. - You wanna quit?\\
131 - Just deal the cards.\\
132 - Attaboy.\\
133 - Uncle Charlie, what's a colonoscopy?\\
134 - - Didn't your dad tell you? - He said it was just a test...\\
135 - ...and it was no big deal, so I looked it up.\\
136 - - And? - I don't believe it.\\
137 - Believe it.\\
138 - Wouldn't it be easier to go in the other way?\\
139 - - You'd think, but no. - Why do they have to do it?\\
140 - - They just wanna see what's going on. - Did Dad lose something?\\
141 - Because when I swallowed 35 cents, we just waited for it to come out.\\
142 - - No kidding. - Yeah, but I only got 30 cents back.\\
143 - Well, the house always takes a cut.\\
144 - - What're you gonna do? - Hit me.\\
145 - Okay, okay. In Vegas, you don't say, "Hit me."\\
146 - If you want a card, you go like this.\\
147 - Okay, fine.\\
148 - - Busted. You owe me another dollar. - What if I didn't want another card?\\
149 - You go like this.\\
150 - That's what I meant to do.\\
151 - There's no do-overs in Vegas.\\
152 - What's the signal to go to the bathroom?\\
153 - There is no signal, you just get up and go.\\
154 - Unless you're on a hot streak, in which case you sit and wet yourself.\\
155 - - You're kidding, right? - You're wearing a $50 pair of slacks...\\
156 - ...and you got $600 on the table, do the math.\\
157 - I have to do math and pee my pants?\\
158 - Alan, are you ready yet?\\
159 - Just about.\\
160 - - And where'd I get the $600? - You've been saying that for 20 minutes.\\
161 - - What are you doing? - Financial planning.\\
162 - I don't wanna look, but I gotta.\\
163 - In class, if we have to go the bathroom, we do this or this.\\
164 - - Get it? - Yeah. I got it.\\
165 - Two hundred and eighty, 280, 280.\\
166 - - What the hell are you doing? - Hang on. Two... Oh, thanks.\\
167 - Now you made me lose count.\\
168 - Ten, 10, 10. Twenty, 20, 20.\\
169 - Stop it, stop it. Why are you doing this?\\
170 - - I have a system. - Do tell.\\
171 - I divide my gambling money into three equal piles.\\
172 - The first one is for day one.\\
173 - That I'll put in my money belt.\\
174 - You're wearing a money belt?\\
175 - Oh, good, you can't tell.\\
176 - I was afraid it made me look chunky.\\
177 - Anyway, the second pile is for day two. I'll give that to you...\\
178 - ...under no circumstances do you give it back to me before midnight...\\
179 - ...which would be the start of day two.\\
180 - Un-freaking-believable. What's the last pile for?\\
181 - That's the most important pile.\\
182 - That's the money I hide in my Frye boot.\\
183 - - In your boot? - But I pretend that I don't have it...\\
184 - ...so that if disaster strikes and I've lost piles one and two...\\
185 - ...then I can pull it out, and poof, I'm solvent again.\\
186 - - Okay. I think I understand. - Pretty clever, huh?\\
187 - Yeah. That's a nice boot.\\
188 - - Let me see it. - Oh, sure.\\
189 - Get dressed and let's go!\\
190 - Okay.\\
191 - - Twenty-one! - Turn over your hole card.\\
192 - Oh, 27.\\
193 - Close, 29.\\
194 - Okay, I'm good.\\
195 - Alrighty.\\
196 - Viva Las Vegas.\\
197 - - Oh, Alan. - What?\\
198 - We're going in a Mercedes, not a time machine.\\
199 - Should I change?\\
200 - You should, but after all these years, I doubt you will.\\
201 - - What's this? - Oh, toiletries, sundries, whatnot.\\
202 - - Really. - Yeah, you'll thank me.\\
203 - Not all hotels supply shower caps and sewing kits.\\
204 - Get in the car. Jake, come on.\\
205 - - Hold on a second. - Oh, for God's sake. Now what?\\
206 - Okay, let's go.\\
207 - - Well, you don't have a fever. - I told you, he's fine. Let's go.\\
208 - Charlie, he threw up in your umbrella stand. Did you miss that?\\
209 - So? Vegas is full of people who throw up.\\
210 - They built that city on a sea of vomit.\\
211 - - I'm okay, I can go. - That's the spirit.\\
212 - You wanna drive five hours with a puking kid in the back of your Mercedes?\\
213 - He can stick his head out the window. Let the guy behind us worry.\\
214 - - We're not going. - Oh, come on.\\
215 - - It's probably just something he ate. - All right.\\
216 - What have you eaten in the last 24 hours?\\
217 - Well, let's see, two bowls of Cocoa Puffs...\\
218 - ...a couple blueberry Pop-Tarts, bag of string cheese.\\
219 - That reminds me, we need more string cheese.\\
220 - Then, for lunch, a Hot Pocket and a Bagel Bite.\\
221 - Then dinner, fried chicken, mashed potatoes and a baloney sandwich.\\
222 - Okay, it's not what he ate.\\
223 - Then, for a snack, I had a glass of Tang and some Cheetos.\\
224 - That explains the orange vomit.\\
225 - It's probably a stomach virus.\\
226 - Oh, please. I throw up all the time.\\
227 - It's just nature's way of saying, "Everybody out of the pool."\\
228 - - I'm putting him to bed. Come on. - They have beds in Vegas.\\
229 - - What if he needs a doctor? - They have doctors in Vegas.\\
230 - I bet if we looked around, we could find a casino with a hospital theme.\\
231 - You know, Caesars Sinai or something.\\
232 - I'll get it.\\
233 - Hello? Hey, Mom.\\
234 - Fine. Nothing.\\
235 - I threw up in Uncle Charlie's umbrella stand...\\
236 - ...and we're going to Vegas. - No!\\
237 - What kind of a father are you?\\
238 - I am a good father. When he threw up, I cancelled the trip.\\
239 - But you were planning to take my 11 -year-old to Las Vegas.\\
240 - It's really a family town now.\\
241 - The mob hardly has any influence at all anymore.\\
242 - Oh, good, Charlie. That helps.\\
243 - Were you planning on telling me about this?\\
244 - What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, Mom.\\
245 - Oh, good, Jake. That helps.\\
246 - - Honey, why don't you go lie down. - Why? I'm fine.\\
247 - Is it too late to get our bets down with Coop?\\
248 - - What bets? - Who's Coop?\\
249 - Go lie down. You're delirious.\\
250 - Listen, Judith, I don't think you understand what's going on here.\\
251 - - Oh, really? - Yeah.\\
252 - - You see, this trip was my idea. - I'm shocked.\\
253 - Let me finish.\\
254 - You see, I wanted to cheer Alan up...\\
255 - Charlie, don't. It's personal.\\
256 - She has a right to know.\\
257 - Judith, Alan got some bad news from the doctor yesterday.\\
258 - Oh, my God, Alan. What is it?\\
259 - Well, the doctor says I have to have a colonoscopy.\\
260 - - Are you having problems? - No, it's just routine.\\
261 - - So? - So I'm really nervous about it.\\
262 - That's it?\\
263 - Well, it's a long, snaky thing with a camera.\\
264 - Oh, please. Your son was 10 pounds at birth...\\
265 - ...and his head was the same size it is now.\\
266 - That's kind of apples and oranges, isn't it?\\
267 - - Goodbye, Alan. - Wait, wait, wait, Judith.\\
268 - - Aren't you gonna take Jake with you? - No, I'm not taking him. He's fine.\\
269 - Don't think I don't see what's going. You put Jake up to telling me he's sick...\\
270 - ...so you could pawn him off while you went to Las Vegas.\\
271 - He did throw up. Smell the umbrella stand.\\
272 - I'm not buying it. I'll get him Monday night.\\
273 - And if I find out you took him to Vegas...\\
274 - ...you'll get a colonoscopy from my attorney.\\
275 - I've seen your alimony checks.\\
276 - You already got one.\\
277 - So, what's the deal? Are we going?\\
278 - - I don't think so. - Why? I'm fine.\\
279 - - Yeah, but your mom said, "No." - Oh, man.\\
280 - Don't eat anything orange.\\
281 - - You wanna know what I think? - Not at all.\\
282 - I think if she wanted to keep you on a leash...\\
283 - ...she shouldn't have divorced you. - I'm not on a leash. I never was.\\
284 - You were living here for three weeks...\\
285 - ...before you were getting up on the couch without permission.\\
286 - Can we just drop it? It was a bad idea.\\
287 - There are no bad ideas. There's just a lack of will to execute them.\\
288 - We're men, Alan. Single men.\\
289 - We go where we want, when we want and how we want.\\
290 - Usually without so much toiletries...\\
291 - ...but I'm trying to be flexible here. - I explained about the toiletries.\\
292 - The point is, you can't let your ex-wife control your behavior...\\
293 - ...no matter how stupid or self-destructive it might be.\\
294 - - Charlie, l... - What profit a man...\\
295 - ...if he escapes the iron shackles of matrimony...\\
296 - ...only to surrender to sexually frustrated tyranny of a vengeful ex-wife?\\
297 - You know what? You're right.\\
298 - - We're men. - Right, are you with me?\\
299 - - I'm with you. - Grab your pack, we're going to Vegas.\\
300 - - Jake? - Just a sec.\\
301 - It's okay. It's mostly water.\\
302 - I'm fine. Let's go. We're men.\\
303 - Nope. You're too sick.\\
304 - Some other time.\\
305 - I'm really sorry I ruined the trip, Uncle Charlie.\\
306 - Hey, it's not your fault.\\
307 - It's your dad who won't let you go.\\
308 - - Thanks, Charlie. - Why should he feel guilty?\\
309 - Here. Put this on Wake Forest.\\
310 - Game's over, Jake. They lost.\\
311 - - What about the spread? - They didn't cover.\\
312 - Give me back my money.\\
313 - Get some rest.\\
314 - - I'm hungry. - Get used to it.\\
315 - - That's some great kid. - Yeah.\\
316 - Sick as a dog, and all he wants is a little action.\\
317 - Well, he gets that from you.\\
318 - You think so?\\
319 - - Because I do try to be a role model. - I know you do.\\
320 - Listen, there's no reason you have to stick around.\\
321 - He's gonna sleep. I can keep an eye on him.\\
322 - No, no, I couldn't go now.\\
323 - Why not? You wanted to go to Vegas. You should go.\\
324 - You're probably gonna have a better time without Jake and me.\\
325 - Probably? Unquestionably.\\
326 - - Then why don't you go? - I don't know.\\
327 - It just feels somehow wrong to abandon the kid when he's sick.\\
328 - Now you know what it feels like to be a parent.\\
329 - How inconvenient.\\
330 - - What's that? - It sounds like Lynyrd Skynyrd.\\
331 - Berta?\\
332 - Surprise!\\
333 - I'm gonna start the IV.\\
334 - In a few seconds, you're gonna feel drowsy.\\
335 - No. No drowsy. I wanna be out. Completely out.\\
336 - Don't worry, you will be.\\
337 - - Right, doctor? - Aye.\\
338 - You won't be remembering anything, me bucko.\\
339 - Thanks, doc. Here's the 2 grand for your children's hospital.\\
340 - And remember, when he wakes up, you're a gas station attendant.

2 - Is that what you do? You plot it out?\\
3 - How can I make Alan miserable today?\\
4 - How can I reach into his chest...\\
5 - ...rip out his heart, and suck it dry?\\
6 - - Mom or ex-wife? - Ex-wife.\\
7 - - Hi, Judith. - Charlie says hello.\\
8 - She says hi. You're evil and selfish, you know that?\\
9 - No, no. l... I think that is a helpful comment.\\
10 - I pay you alimony and child support so that you can have a nice house...\\
11 - ...a nice car, every weekend free because I've got Jake.\\
12 - And yet you're telling me you need a vacation?\\
13 - Oh, really? Oh, really? And what exactly is stressing you out, Judith?\\
14 - Is it the weekly manicure? The housekeeper?\\
15 - - Boob lift. - The boob lift.\\
16 - - That you paid for. - That I paid for.\\
17 - - And never got to see. - And never got to see.\\
18 - No, no, no. You listen to me.\\
19 - I think you live a damn fine lifestyle...\\
20 - ...that I work 60 hours a week to support.\\
21 - So if anybody needs a vacation, it's not you. It's me!\\
22 - All right, then.\\
23 - Goodbye.\\
24 - Judith's going to Hawaii for a week.\\
25 - So Jake's staying here.\\
26 - I'm shocked.\\
27 - Come on, Jake. It's time to get up for school.\\
28 - I can't go to school.\\
29 - - I'm sick. - What's wrong?\\
30 - I think I have acid reflex disease.\\
31 - Really? Acid reflex disease?\\
32 - Where does it hurt?\\
33 - My head?\\
34 - - Nice try. - My throat?\\
35 - Get up.\\
36 - All right, all right.\\
37 - I just want you to know, I'm starting my day really stressed out.\\
38 - Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like me to send you to Hawaii?\\
39 - That would be nice.\\
40 - What's taking you so long?\\
41 - - I can't find my other shoe. - So put on a different pair.\\
42 - But this one's on already.\\
43 - Hey, what are you doing up so late?\\
44 - It's 7 a.m.\\
45 - - What am I doing up so early? - Where have you been?\\
46 - Searching the kingdom for the woman who fits this shoe.\\
47 - Hey, that's mine. Where was it?\\
48 - In the driveway.\\
49 - Oh, yeah!\\
50 - Okay, let's go.\\
51 - - Got my lunch? - Lunch?\\
52 - - You're supposed to make me lunch. - Oh, crap.\\
53 - This isn't helping my stress level.\\
54 - I forget. Why are you here in the middle of the week?\\
55 - - Because my mom's on vacation. - From what?\\
56 - Me.\\
57 - A word of advice: Don't date women who live near the airport.\\
58 - It's impossible to sleep in.\\
59 - I'll try to remember that.\\
60 - Wish I knew her well enough to bring her back here.\\
61 - Well, maybe next time.\\
62 - Next time?\\
63 - - My lunch ready? - It's right here. What are you doing?\\
64 - - That was for Jake. - I don't see his name on it.\\
65 - Okay, fine. You'Il... You'll have half a sandwich...\\
66 - ...and a banana, and maybe an orange, and...\\
67 - ...what the hell, an artichoke.\\
68 - An artichoke?\\
69 - Maybe you can trade it for something good.\\
70 - With who? One of the slow kids?\\
71 - Give it a shot. Tell him it's a puppy.\\
72 - Come on, let's go.\\
73 - I forgot. I have to write five insightful questions I'd ask George Washington.\\
74 - What? Last night you said you had no homework.\\
75 - Dad, I just said I forgot.\\
76 - - Okay, fine. You'll do it in the car. - I was planning on doing math in the car.\\
77 - President Washington.\\
78 - Question number one:\\
79 - "Have you ever thought of coming back from the dead as a zombie?"\\
80 - Jake, I don't think that's what your teacher had in mind.\\
81 - Do you wanna do it?\\
82 - No, no. You're doing fine.\\
83 - Question two:\\
84 - "Can you eat human flesh with wooden teeth?"\\
85 - Hi, Lorraine. I'm running a little late.\\
86 - Could you move my 9:30 to 10, my 10 to 10:30...\\
87 - ...and, well, you see where this is going.\\
88 - You don't?\\
89 - Hang on, I've got somebody on the other line.\\
90 - Hello.\\
91 - Oh, hi, Mom. Look, I can't talk right now. I'm driving Jake to school.\\
92 - Well, Judith's in Hawaii.\\
93 - No, that does not make me a doormat.\\
94 - Patsy is just another word for doormat, Mom.\\
95 - l... Lo... I gotta go. I'll call you later.\\
96 - Hi, Lorraine. I'm back.\\
97 - No, no, don't put me on hold.\\
98 - Question three:\\
99 - "Do you think the Revolutionary War would have been won sooner...\\
100 - ...if you had an army of the undead?"\\
101 - This is actually pretty easy.\\
102 - Lorraine, this is Dr. Harper.\\
103 - Listen, I'm... I'm gonna be there in about 40 minutes.\\
104 - What do you mean, you're going home?\\
105 - Oh, come on. You were premenstrual two weeks ago.\\
106 - Yes, I keep track.\\
107 - Question number four:\\
108 - "What's your opinion of the new, faster-walking zombies?"\\
109 - No, no, no. Lor... Lorraine.\\
110 - Don't cry. Please don't cry.\\
111 - Charlie, I'm going home.\\
112 - How many times have I asked you not to do that?\\
113 - - I'm going home. - I suppose you want me to pay you.\\
114 - Not necessary. I took the money out of your wallet.\\
115 - - Fine. - Guess what? I got a raise.\\
116 - Congratulations.\\
117 - - You wanna know why I got a raise? - No, I'm sure I had my reasons.\\
118 - Because when I took this job, all I had to do was clean up after you.\\
119 - And while that may have been disgusting, it was doable.\\
120 - And then your brother moved in, which I accepted with my usual good humor...\\
121 - ...because he cleans up after himself like a neurotic raccoon.\\
122 - This is about the kid, right?\\
123 - Good for you. That's why you're the boss.\\
124 - He's just here for a week. It's a temporary situation.\\
125 - And yet my raise is permanent.\\
126 - Sounds fair.\\
127 - God, what a horrible day.\\
128 - - Tell me about it. - Show of hands:\\
129 - Who spent their day pre-soaking the shorts of a kid...\\
130 - ...who leaves more skid marks than a getaway car?\\
131 - That's what I thought.\\
132 - Now, if you ladies will excuse me...\\
133 - ...I have three buses to catch.\\
134 - I bet she catches them by hand.\\
135 - Yeah, well, I have my own problems.\\
136 - I was late for work, my receptionist went home early...\\
137 - ...because, apparently, she has the reproductive cycle of a jackrabbit...\\
138 - ...and then I had a large, drunk Samoan man walk in...\\
139 - ...who thought that chiropractor means "massage with happy ending."\\
140 - I kept trying to crack his back and he kept rolling over and winking at me.\\
141 - - Wow, that's creepy. - Tell me about it.\\
142 - So you're gonna see him again?\\
143 - Or should I say, are you gonna see him Samoa?\\
144 - Oh, come on. That was funny.\\
145 - Oh, yeah. It's hilarious.\\
146 - You know what your problem is?\\
147 - - You don't drink enough. - You're probably right.\\
148 - This is the first time today I've had a chance to just sit down and decompress.\\
149 - - Cheers? - Oh, cheers.\\
150 - Oh, that's good.\\
151 - I keep having this nagging feeling that I forgot something.\\
152 - - lf you forgot it, it wasn't important. - Yeah, I guess.\\
153 - I can't believe you forgot me.\\
154 - I said I'm sorry.\\
155 - You forgot me.\\
156 - I know. I feel terrible.\\
157 - How many kids you got?\\
158 - - There's a towel on the floor, buddy. - I'm okay.\\
159 - I want you to sit on it so you don't leave a wet ass-print on my leather seats.\\
160 - You forgot me too.\\
161 - Yeah, but I'm just your uncle.\\
162 - He's your father.\\
163 - Yeah, my own father.\\
164 - Thanks, Charlie.\\
165 - Is there any way I can make it up to you?\\
166 - - You wanna go out for a special dinner? - No.\\
167 - - How about a movie? - Why?\\
168 - You're gonna leave me there too?\\
169 - For the last time, I am sorry.\\
170 - Won't be the last time.\\
171 - I just wanna go home. I'm cold and I'm wet.\\
172 - If you kick the back of my seat again, you're gonna be colder and wetter.\\
173 - Ease up on him. He's had a rough day.\\
174 - Yeah, my dad left me out in the rain.\\
175 - I'm sorry.\\
176 - What did I tell you?\\
177 - What's all this stuff on the floor?\\
178 - I don't know. Junk mail. Parking tickets.\\
179 - - What's this? - Satin blindfold.\\
180 - - For what? - What do you mean, "For what"?\\
181 - In case I run into...\\
182 - ...a pi ata.\\
183 - - You're unbelievable. - Don't judge.\\
184 - You felt up a Samoan dude.\\
185 - Hey, this is for me. From the IRS.\\
186 - It was mailed a month ago.\\
187 - Damn post office.\\
188 - Oh, perfect.\\
189 - - Just freaking perfect. - Good news?\\
190 - I'm being audited.\\
191 - They wanna see me tomorrow.\\
192 - Oh, well, look at the upside.\\
193 - What upside?\\
194 - Yeah, okay, you got me.\\
195 - How could you forget to give this to me?\\
196 - I don't know. How could you forget your only son in the rain?\\
197 - - Yeah. - Yeah. Watch the cleats.\\
198 - Let's go, sleepyhead. Rise and shine, up and at 'em.\\
199 - Get out of my room or I'll kill you with my bare hands.\\
200 - I'm being audited today. You have to take Jake to school.\\
201 - Put him in a cab.\\
202 - Oh, please. I am counting on you.\\
203 - Then you're headed for disappointment.\\
204 - You need to get Jake dressed, make him his lunch...\\
205 - ...and get him to school by 8, okay? - Okay.\\
206 - - You're not moving. - Yes, I am.\\
207 - I'm flipping you off under the covers.\\
208 - Get up!\\
209 - All right, I'm up.\\
210 - So you know what to do with Jake?\\
211 - You have to be responsible. You have to be me today.\\
212 - - Think you can handle that? - You left him out in the rain yesterday.\\
213 - It's not like you set the bar real high.\\
214 - - Charlie. - Relax.\\
215 - I think I'm capable of getting your kid to school.\\
216 - Good, because I really need your help.\\
217 - So... So I'm gonna leave now.\\
218 - You're all set, right?\\
219 - Charlie?\\
220 - Get up!\\
221 - Get dressed. I'm taking you to school.\\
222 - I can't. I'm sick.\\
223 - Yeah, well, bite me.\\
224 - - Hey. - Don't... Don't screw with me, shorty.\\
225 - I only got, like, nine hours of sleep last night.\\
226 - - Now get dressed. - I'm supposed to take a shower first.\\
227 - Sit near a window.\\
228 - - Here, put these on. - I wore these yesterday.\\
229 - They're still extremely stylish. Put them on.\\
230 - - Can I have some privacy, please? - For what? You're 11.\\
231 - That's close to puberty.\\
232 - Okay, okay.\\
233 - I'm leaving.\\
234 - What am I, nuts?\\
235 - Get up!\\
236 - I could have dressed myself, you know.\\
237 - You had your chance.\\
238 - I look stupid.\\
239 - Yeah, well, you're close to puberty.\\
240 - Oh, I forgot to comb my hair.\\
241 - No, no, no. I'll do it.\\
242 - That's spit.\\
243 - Hey, one man's saliva is another man's mousse. Now shut up.\\
244 - There, you're beautiful. Let's go.\\
245 - - What about lunch? - Sorry, I have plans.\\
246 - No, you're supposed to make me lunch.\\
247 - Oh, all right, come on.\\
248 - You're not really a morning person, are you?\\
249 - You're just saying that because I spit on your head.\\
250 - - You like cold pizza, right? - Sure.\\
251 - - This is frozen. - Yeah. If you sit on it...\\
252 - ...it'll thaw by lunch.\\
253 - My butt is freezing.\\
254 - You wanted pizza.\\
255 - All right, I'll put the seat warmer on.\\
256 - Cook it from both sides.\\
257 - - I like it better when my dad takes me. - Oh, gee, you're not having fun?\\
258 - Because I'm farting rainbows over here.\\
259 - First, he forgets me. Now he leaves me with you.\\
260 - Hey, you know what?\\
261 - Your father works like a dog to make sure you have everything.\\
262 - If he's not there for you...\\
263 - ...it's just because he's trying to stay out of federal prison.\\
264 - I think he needs to have sex.\\
265 - I was kidding about prison, Jake.\\
266 - What do you mean he needs to have sex?\\
267 - Well, he's been really grumpy lately.\\
268 - You're usually in a good mood. I figure it's because you have sex.\\
269 - Jake, it takes more than sex to make a man happy.\\
270 - You also need money.\\
271 - All right, have a good day.\\
272 - - Learn something. - This isn't my school.\\
273 - - What do you mean? - I mean, I don't go to school here.\\
274 - Well, where do you go to school?\\
275 - Woodward Avenue Elementary.\\
276 - - And where the hell is that? - Woodward Avenue, I guess.\\
277 - I don't know why you can't tough it out here for one day.\\
278 - Make some new friends.\\
279 - Hey, Alan, it's Charlie.\\
280 - Look, I wanna ask you something but I don't want you to read anything into it.\\
281 - Where exactly is Jake's school?\\
282 - You don 't know where his school is?\\
283 - What the hell is wrong with you?\\
284 - - Are you trying to kill me? - You could be right about the sex thing.\\
285 - Okay, Woodward Avenue Elementary School.\\
286 - Looks like they're closed.\\
287 - That's because I'm an hour late. Even the crossing guard is gone.\\
288 - How about this? Why don't you just bag school and we'll go catch a movie.\\
289 - - I can't skip school. I'm in the play. - What play?\\
290 - The founding fathers' play. You'll be there, right?\\
291 - Why would I be there?\\
292 - Because Mom's in Hawaii and Dad's got that tax thing and you're all that's left.\\
293 - Oh, I'm all that's left.\\
294 - Hey, I'm not thrilled about it either.\\
295 - Okay. Where and when?\\
296 - In the auditorium after lunch.\\
297 - Oh, yeah. I need a Ben Franklin costume.\\
298 - You're telling me this now?\\
299 - I told Mom but she's in Hawaii.\\
300 - All right.\\
301 - Let's see. Washington, Jackson, Lincoln.\\
302 - Here we go. Benjamin Franklin.\\
303 - Why can't you be Lincoln?\\
304 - A beard, a mole, a top hat, we're done.\\
305 - Because Lincoln wasn't a founding father.\\
306 - Okay, I'll see what I can do.\\
307 - Now get out of here.\\
308 - Hey.\\
309 - You forgot your lunch.\\
310 - Hey.\\
311 - God, what a day.\\
312 - I don't wanna hear it.\\
313 - You know why I was being audited?\\
314 - Not because I have unsubstantiated deductions. Which I have.\\
315 - Not because I take the occasional cash payment from a client...\\
316 - ...and forget to report it. Which I do.\\
317 - It was because no one at the IRS...\\
318 - ...could believe I was paying as much alimony as I claimed.\\
319 - It took me three hours to convince them that, yes...\\
320 - ...I am that big a schmuck.\\
321 - Oh, boo-hoo.\\
322 - You want a real fun time?\\
323 - Try finding an extra small Ben Franklin costume...\\
324 - ...at 9:00 in the morning.\\
325 - Oh, right. The play. How was it?\\
326 - Boffo. A smash.\\
327 - Among the highlights were a 12-year-old Chinese George Washington...\\
328 - ...with a powdered wig and a snot bubble...\\
329 - ...and your kid in a bald cap and granny glasses...\\
330 - ...holding a Tweety Bird kite and announcing he's discovered elasticity.\\
331 - - Oh, I wish I'd seen it. - Don't worry, you will.\\
332 - It was videotaped from about 150 different angles.\\
333 - I should tell him I'm sorry I wasn't there.\\
334 - - Yeah, you should. - Is he in his room?\\
335 - Here you go, pal. Your favorite.\\
336 - Bacon double cheeseburger and cheese fries.\\
337 - And for dessert, I got fudge brownies with that ice cream you like.\\
338 - Is this supposed to make up for everything?\\
339 - - Yeah. - Pretty much.\\
340 - Look, Jake, I know it's been rough and I'm sorry.\\
341 - We're human, we make mistakes. But I promise you...\\
342 - ...neither of us will ever, ever forget to pick you up again.\\
343 - Yeah, I still wanna go back to Mom's.\\
344 - When is she coming home from Hawaii, anyway?\\
345 - Oh, crap.
\subsection {Episode 17: Woohoo, a Hernia Exam!}
1 - Here. This is for you.\\
2 - Thank you.\\
3 - And I didn't get you anything.\\
4 - It's your kid's toilet seat.\\
5 - It's obviously in his way, and I'm tired of cleaning it.\\
6 - Oh, come on, Berta.\\
7 - - He's 11. - He's a pig.\\
8 - I'll talk to him.\\
9 - While you're at it, you may wanna mention...\\
10 - ...the half-eaten egg salad sandwiches in his toy chest...\\
11 - ...the dead marine life at the back of the closet...\\
12 - ...and the booger collection under the bed.\\
13 - I'll do my best to address your concerns.\\
14 - Don't condescend to me, Zippy. I'll snap you like a butter bean.\\
15 - Excuse me. Is one of you Alan?\\
16 - I'm Alan.\\
17 - Oh, good. Charlie wants you to come upstairs.\\
18 - - Why? - Well, it's kind of hard to explain.\\
19 - - Try. - Oh, yeah, try.\\
20 - Well, he's kind of stuck.\\
21 - - In what? - In what?\\
22 - Not in anything, just stuck.\\
23 - Would you hurry?\\
24 - - Where are you going? - Oh, like I'm gonna miss this?\\
25 - Charlie? Are you okay?\\
26 - Do I look okay?\\
27 - - What happened? - I pulled my back.\\
28 - I didn't do anything. I was lying there and he started screaming.\\
29 - - I understand. - I mean, I wasn't just lying there.\\
30 - - I got it. - Damn, I wish I had a camera.\\
31 - That's okay. It's all on video.\\
32 - Alan, you're a chiropractor. Do something.\\
33 - Really? You want my help?\\
34 - Even after you referred to my profession as, what was it...\\
35 - ..."urban voodoo"?\\
36 - I'm sorry. Now help me.\\
37 - Okay. Okay. We'll see what we can do.\\
38 - Yeah, yeah, okay, very funny, very funny.\\
39 - Hold on. Berta, I'm gonna need a dead rooster.\\
40 - Check your kid's room.\\
41 - Excuse me, Charlie, sorry you're not feeling well, but I have an audition.\\
42 - - Go. - It's a Wheat Thins commercial.\\
43 - - I'm an actress. - Of course you are.\\
44 - I had a nice time, Charlie.\\
45 - - I'll call you. - Great.\\
46 - Oh, if you find my tongue stud, let me know.\\
47 - Okay, let's see what we've got here.\\
48 - - Is this tender? - A little.\\
49 - - On a scale of one to ten? - I don't know. Three?\\
50 - - Okay, what about this? - Four.\\
51 - And what about this?\\
52 - I'm gonna need a number, Charlie.\\
53 - No, no, I changed my mind. Leave me alone.\\
54 - Oh, don't be a baby.\\
55 - - Stay away. - I have to examine you.\\
56 - - It's okay. I'm better. - No, you're not.\\
57 - - Now, stop moving. - Really, I'm fine. Just don't...\\
58 - Ten. Ten. That's a ten.\\
59 - - Are you happy? - Do I look happy?\\
60 - Let's get you back on the bed so I can give you an adjustment.\\
61 - No, no, no, no. New plan.\\
62 - I need someone who can give me drugs.\\
63 - I'm not holding, but I can make a couple calls.\\
64 - Drugs just mask the problem.\\
65 - Fine, mask it. Throw a cape on it, and let it fight crime.\\
66 - I just want it to go away.\\
67 - Good news. I think I know where Wheat Thins lost her tongue stud.\\
68 - For the love of God.\\
69 - Oh, mommy.\\
70 - Feeling better?\\
71 - No, I just passed out for a second.\\
72 - Berta, I'm gonna take Charlie to the doctor.\\
73 - - You keep an eye on Jake. - Fine.\\
74 - Whoa, hey.\\
75 - And please put his toilet seat back on.\\
76 - I really think you should put on your seat belt.\\
77 - Do you now?\\
78 - Did you forget it took three of us just to put on my shorts?\\
79 - Suit yourself. I should call your doctor and tell him we're coming.\\
80 - - What's his number? - I don't know.\\
81 - All right, I'll call directory assistance. What's his name? Where's he located?\\
82 - Dr. Schwartz. Beverly Hills.\\
83 - - You're kidding, right? - Do I look like I'm kidding?\\
84 - Well, I need a first name.\\
85 - I remember his receptionist's name. Julie.\\
86 - Cute redhead with a slight speech impediment.\\
87 - She called me "Charlie."\\
88 - I almost asked her out once...\\
89 - ...but I couldn't face the inevitable phone calls.\\
90 - "I love you, Charlie. Don't leave me."\\
91 - Yeah, yeah, and your doctor's first name is?\\
92 - Oh, I have no idea.\\
93 - Idiot.\\
94 - Yes, Beverly Hills, California.\\
95 - Dr. Schwartz.\\
96 - Yeah, I don't know the first name.\\
97 - No, I'm not kidding.\\
98 - There are 128 Dr. Schwartzes in Beverly Hills.\\
99 - What street is he on?\\
100 - Wilshire Boulevard, I think.\\
101 - Wilshire Boulevard, we think.\\
102 - Okay, we're down to 47 Schwartzes.\\
103 - Just forget it. Drive down Wilshire. I'll know the building when I see it.\\
104 - Never mind, we're gonna play...\\
105 - ...Find the Jewish Doctor in Beverly Hills.\\
106 - Wait, wait. There it is.\\
107 - Now, you see, that wouldn't have happened...\\
108 - ...if you'd been wearing your seat belt.\\
109 - Alan, if I can ever use my legs again...\\
110 - ...the first thing I'm gonna do is kick your ass into your throat.\\
111 - That's not Julie.\\
112 - - So? - It's just important to me that you know.\\
113 - - Can I help you? - Yeah, I'm Charlie Harper.\\
114 - - I need to see my doctor. - Do you have an appointment?\\
115 - No, but this is an emergency.\\
116 - He has to get back to Notre Dame and ring the bell.\\
117 - Oh, I get it. He's hunched over. That's funny.\\
118 - Yeah, can I see my doctor, please?\\
119 - - Who's your doctor? - Dr. Schwartz.\\
120 - - Stanley Schwartz? - Yes, Stanley.\\
121 - - It's Stanley. - Thank you.\\
122 - When was the last time you were here?\\
123 - I don't know. A couple of years ago. Why?\\
124 - - Dr. Schwartz passed away. - Oh, no.\\
125 - So where's Julie?\\
126 - Julie we had to let go.\\
127 - She was playing a little fast and loose with the old prescription pad.\\
128 - I'm guessing Valium.\\
129 - Is there somebody else who can see him?\\
130 - Yeah, but not Dr. Schwartz's doctor, okay?\\
131 - Dr. Talmadge took over Dr. Schwartz's practice.\\
132 - It's a little tight right now, but I could squeeze you in.\\
133 - That's kind of how this happened.\\
134 - Oh, my. So this was a sexual injury.\\
135 - Well, thank goodness you're okay.\\
136 - This is really gross. Why do I have to do it?\\
137 - - You want your toilet seat back? - Yes.\\
138 - Then keep scrubbing.\\
139 - You know, taking it wasn't funny. I could have broke my butt.\\
140 - Oh, come on. How could that not be funny?\\
141 - Don't forget to clean on the outside. That's all you.\\
142 - - And the floor, and the wall. - Okay, okay.\\
143 - How in the hell did you hit the wall anyway?\\
144 - I don't know, it just gets away from me sometimes.\\
145 - After a day scrubbing toilets...\\
146 - ...I'm betting you'll be able to pee through a Cheerio at 10 paces.\\
147 - Oh, God.\\
148 - Oh, jeez.\\
149 - Hey, guess what.\\
150 - The Soviet Union is boycotting the Olympics.\\
151 - My pain is just a big joke to you, isn't it?\\
152 - I offered to help you, Charlie, and you refused, so...\\
153 - ...yeah.\\
154 - I'll tell you, if you came to me as a patient in this much pain...\\
155 - ...I wouldn't make you wait. I'd see you right away.\\
156 - So would my dry cleaner, but I don't let him touch me either.\\
157 - I could help you, Charlie.\\
158 - I've already isolated the source of your discomfort.\\
159 - All that's left would be to realign your vertebrae...\\
160 - ...through a gentle series of manipulations and stretches...\\
161 - ...thereby alleviating your pain.\\
162 - Well, you didn't explain it like that. That's different.\\
163 - - So you'll let me work on you? - Not in a million years.\\
164 - Fine. Worship at the altar of the American Medical Association.\\
165 - Swallow the pharmaceutical companies' propaganda.\\
166 - I'll swallow it, I'll sniff it, I'll insert it rectally.\\
167 - Anything to kill the pain. I'm dying here.\\
168 - Mr. Harper, I'm Dr. Talmadge.\\
169 - Hello, doctor.\\
170 - Hallelujah. It's a miracle.\\
171 - So I see you're having some back pain.\\
172 - That will be $ 100, please.\\
173 - Yeah, it started in my back...\\
174 - ...but now it's kind of radiating out into a body-wide unbearable agony.\\
175 - You have a really cute little nose, you know that?\\
176 - - Did the pain start in your lower back? - Best I can tell...\\
177 - ...it's a spasm between L4 and L5.\\
178 - - Oh, are you a doctor? - Yes, I'm a chiropractor.\\
179 - So no.\\
180 - How did this happen?\\
181 - Well, I slipped.\\
182 - On an actress.\\
183 - I can handle this, Alan.\\
184 - Okay, see, the thing is, I was in the middle of...\\
185 - An actress.\\
186 - I'm warning you.\\
187 - - Do the details really matter? - No, no, I think I got the picture.\\
188 - There's video if you need it.\\
189 - Keep it up.\\
190 - Okay, I see here your last visit was four years ago.\\
191 - A mild hernia brought about by...\\
192 - Okay. I think I'm seeing a pattern here.\\
193 - He's a sexual compulsive with narcissistic tendencies.\\
194 - Oh, so you're a pretend psychiatrist too.\\
195 - So, what's the course of treatment here?\\
196 - A pill, a shot? Maybe one of those epidurals?\\
197 - First I'm going to get your blood pressure and take x-rays.\\
198 - - I take blood pressure and x-rays. - Your mother must be very proud.\\
199 - Actually, no.\\
200 - Someone will be in to take you to x-ray.\\
201 - Wait. I'm still in pain.\\
202 - Try and hang in there. In the meantime...\\
203 - ...maybe your little buddy can give you a massage.\\
204 - - Can you believe her? - Yeah, she is something else.\\
205 - Please don't tell me you're interested in that condescending...\\
206 - ...arrogant excuse for a woman.\\
207 - Pardon me, Alan, but that is a condescending...\\
208 - ...arrogant, hot excuse for a woman.\\
209 - She's just your typical obnoxious MD.\\
210 - I'm a doctor. I have special license plates.\\
211 - I can park wherever I want.\\
212 - I know where I wanna park.\\
213 - You're unbelievable. Does your penis have an off switch?\\
214 - A pause button?\\
215 - No, just a little freckle.\\
216 - You're always telling me I should date a better class of woman.\\
217 - What's classier than a doctor?\\
218 - Oh, please. Four years of med school, two years of internship...\\
219 - ...a year of residency, and everybody thinks they're so special.\\
220 - But I'll tell you something. A new day is dawning.\\
221 - A day of reckoning. And it is spelled HMO.\\
222 - No more country clubs. No more Cadillacs.\\
223 - Just sky-high insurance premiums and low, slow, copay reimbursements.\\
224 - Just like the rest of us.\\
225 - I'll bet she knows a lot of secret anatomy stuff.\\
226 - You know, places you touch and the top of your head flies off.\\
227 - If you have sex with a doctor, there's a chance they'll split...\\
228 - ...in the middle of the night for an emergency.\\
229 - Well, that's just a price you'll have to pay.\\
230 - No, no. That works for me.\\
231 - Okay, I finished the toilet, the shower...\\
232 - ...and the sink. - What took you so long?\\
233 - I went to the bathroom, and I had to start over.\\
234 - Take these, and get started on the kitchen floor.\\
235 - Why? I didn't pee in here.\\
236 - Okay, once, but it was in the sink.\\
237 - The sink? How'd you manage that?\\
238 - It's not that hard. You just gotta drink a lot of root beer, lean back...\\
239 - ...and figure the angle.\\
240 - So tell me about Dr. Talmadge.\\
241 - - Is she seeing anybody? - Yes.\\
242 - - Is it serious? - Dog bite.\\
243 - - No, I mean... - Charlie, give it a rest.\\
244 - What?\\
245 - You're sitting here in pain because of a casual sexual encounter...\\
246 - ...and now you're trying to drum up another one.\\
247 - - Yeah, so? - Don't you get it?\\
248 - Your entire life is about jumping...\\
249 - ...from one shallow, meaningless relationship to the next.\\
250 - And?\\
251 - You're a grown man. You can't go through life...\\
252 - ...drinking and partying and humping anything that doesn't shake you off.\\
253 - Yes, I can.\\
254 - But sooner or later, it's gonna catch up to you.\\
255 - Eventually, you will have to pay the piper.\\
256 - - Who says? - Everybody says.\\
257 - Really? Because I'm just hearing you.\\
258 - If 2000 years of human history has taught us anything...\\
259 - ...it's that there is karmic justice in the world...\\
260 - ...and that when people live the way you do...\\
261 - ...bad things happen to them to even things out.\\
262 - Well, I don't agree.\\
263 - It's not up for debate.\\
264 - It's a law, like gravity.\\
265 - Oh, I agree with gravity.\\
266 - Good, we wouldn't want you flying off the planet...\\
267 - ...with nothing to hump but satellites.\\
268 - If it makes you feel better, something bad happened.\\
269 - - I'm in excruciating pain. - That's not enough.\\
270 - Trust me, Charlie. The piper has yet to be paid.\\
271 - The only question is how high a tab you want before the bill comes due.\\
272 - Okay. I get it.\\
273 - Well, good.\\
274 - So you think I have a shot with that doctor, or what?\\
275 - It's like trying to talk Shakespeare to a Hershey bar.\\
276 - Who's Piper?\\
277 - Oh, you poor, clueless bitch. Never trust a drifter with an eye patch.\\
278 - - Berta. - What?\\
279 - I'm tired, and my hands are all red and pruney.\\
280 - I've seen your grades. Get used to it.\\
281 - How do I know when I'm done?\\
282 - Don't worry about that, honey, I'll tell you.\\
283 - Oh, for God's sakes, don't kiss him. He's your brother.\\
284 - - I have x-rays. - Oh, good. Let me see them.\\
285 - Oh, golly, no. Only for a doctor.\\
286 - Hey, I'm a doctor.\\
287 - Oh, yeah? Where you parked?\\
288 - Alan, you gotta relax.\\
289 - You're harboring the kind of resentment that eats away at your insides...\\
290 - ...until you wake up one day peeing blood and crapping into a bag.\\
291 - Thanks for the advice.\\
292 - You know the difference between you and me?\\
293 - I have a functioning liver...\\
294 - ...and somehow, you're gonna get laid tonight.\\
295 - That's ridiculous, Alan. She's an educated professional.\\
296 - Probably gonna have to throw a few fancy meals at her first.\\
297 - Boo-hoo, you'll have to wait a couple of weeks.\\
298 - Couple of weeks?\\
299 - Anyway, the difference between you and me...\\
300 - ...is that when life gives me lemons, I make lemonade.\\
301 - When you get lemons, you just bite into them...\\
302 - ...and suck them inside out.\\
303 - Okay. Let's see what we've got.\\
304 - No fractures, no dislocations.\\
305 - - Looks like just a simple muscle spasm. - Between L4 and L5?\\
306 - Oh, good for you.\\
307 - Okay, I am gonna give you a shot, which should ease the pain...\\
308 - ...and also allow your muscles to relax.\\
309 - Have you had Demerol before?\\
310 - No, but I've heard nice things about it.\\
311 - Okay, I'm just gonna pull your shorts down a little.\\
312 - But Dr. Talmadge, I don't even know your first name.\\
313 - - Michelle. - Michelle.\\
314 - That's prettier than Stanley.\\
315 - - Sorry. - That's okay.\\
316 - It's all part of the little meet-cute thing we got going here.\\
317 - So how long does it take before I start feeling...\\
318 - ...happy.\\
319 - Happy, happy, happy. Happy.\\
320 - Michelle, did you know I have a house on the beach?\\
321 - - Really? I love the beach. - Oh, good, because I have a house there.\\
322 - Wait outside, I need to give your brother a hernia exam to make sure...\\
323 - ...he hasn't reinjured the area. - A hernia exam.\\
324 - - And your boxers. - Bye-bye, boxers.\\
325 - I was wrong. There's no justice.\\
326 - I thought there was justice, but there's not.\\
327 - What, you think there's justice?\\
328 - Because there's not.\\
329 - Turn your head and cough.\\
330 - - You have very warm hands. - Again.\\
331 - You have very warm hands.\\
332 - So any chance I could take you out for dinner tonight?\\
333 - - You're hitting on me? - You started it.\\
334 - - You're amazing. - Well, statistically...\\
335 - ...I'm only slightly above average.\\
336 - But I make up for it with enthusiasm and perseverance.\\
337 - No, what's amazing is that you don't remember me.\\
338 - Well, sure I remember you.\\
339 - You're the pretty woman cupping my testicles from earlier.\\
340 - Back when I was in medical school, you and I went out for a couple months.\\
341 - You wanna loosen your grip there?\\
342 - Then for reasons I never understood...\\
343 - ...you stopped calling me, and started seeing my roommate.\\
344 - The grip.\\
345 - I always hoped I'd run into you again.\\
346 - Please. Just leave me one.\\
347 - Oh, dear God.\\
348 - My brother's making lemonade.\\
349 - I need to go to the bathroom.\\
350 - So go.\\
351 - Oh, yeah.\\
352 - Good night. I'll see you tomorrow.\\
353 - - Night. - Night.\\
354 - So, are you gonna tell me what happened with you and the doctor?\\
355 - What do you think happened?\\
356 - I think she shot you full of drugs...\\
357 - ...you dropped trou, she jumped your bones...\\
358 - ...and you're the luckiest bastard to walk the earth.\\
359 - Well, for your information...\\
360 - ...that's exactly what happened.\\
361 - Not even a little justice.\\
362 - This is a justice-free zone.\\
363 - Looking for justice? Sorry, fresh out.\\
364 - Enjoy sucking on that lemon.\\
365 - Nope, not yet.
\subsection {Episode 18: It Was 'Mame, 'Mom}
1 - Some side effects include headaches, blurred vision, and high blood pressure.\\
2 - Ask your doctor if it's right for you.\\
3 - - Dad? - Yeah?\\
4 - Do you suffer from erectile dysfunction?\\
5 - Well, Alan? Do you?\\
6 - Jake, wh... What do you know about erectile dysfunction?\\
7 - It's something to do with your penis, right?\\
8 - - Right. - And they say one out of three guys...\\
9 - ...gets it, and mine's fine, so it's gotta be one of you.\\
10 - - I'm fine. - Not me, l...\\
11 - So, what are the pills for?\\
12 - Well, what they do, Jake, is that they... They dilate the blood vessels...\\
13 - ...which allows more blood to easily flow to certain...\\
14 - They're boner pills, Jake.\\
15 - To get them, or to make them go away?\\
16 - To get them. Go get ready for bed.\\
17 - What's the point? They're not good for anything.\\
18 - You ever try any of those drugs?\\
19 - Once or twice. Out of curiosity, not necessity.\\
20 - - What did you think? - Not my thing.\\
21 - It's like corking the bat. You?\\
22 - Yeah, that's what my ex-wife wanted. More sex with me that lasted longer.\\
23 - Hello. Oh, hey, Eric. Hiya. What's happening, boyfriend?\\
24 - Oh, you're terrible. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?\\
25 - So, what's up? Saturday? Let me check my book.\\
26 - Saturday is marvelous.\\
27 - How dressy? Eveningwear, or California casual?\\
28 - Oh, goody. An excuse to shop. Like I need one.\\
29 - Okey-dokey, artichokey. Ciao for now.\\
30 - - What? - Something you wanna tell me?\\
31 - That? Oh, that's Eric. He's the head of a big ad agency.\\
32 - - Throws a lot of jingle work my way. - He wouldn't be gay, would he?\\
33 - What difference does it make? A person's sexuality...\\
34 - ...is a personal thing. It has no relevance in the business world.\\
35 - - But he is gay. - Oh, yeah.\\
36 - You know, it's okay to call them queer again.\\
37 - Good to know. Good to know.\\
38 - Would it fair to assume that you've led him to believe that...\\
39 - ...you are of a similar persuasion?\\
40 - Not deliberately. I kind of sort of backed into it.\\
41 - - Excuse me? - Okay. Poor choice of words.\\
42 - When we first met, I found myself falling into his... What do you call it?\\
43 - Futon?\\
44 - No, no, his manner of expressing himself.\\
45 - Tone, gestures. Like talking to a Southerner...\\
46 - ...you start saying "y'all" and "grits" and "tobaccy."\\
47 - - Oh, Charlie. - It's harmless.\\
48 - He throws me work. I want him to feel comfortable with me.\\
49 - And how far do you go to make him feel comfortable?\\
50 - Don't worry. I just sparkle a little bit. I don't burst into flames.\\
51 - - I don't know how you live with yourself. - Actually, I don't live with myself.\\
52 - I have a significant other.\\
53 - - What? - We're both invited...\\
54 - ...to a cocktail party Saturday night.\\
55 - What?\\
56 - - No. Absolutely not. - Oh, come on.\\
57 - You always complain we don't hang out.\\
58 - I didn't mean I wanted to date you.\\
59 - You don't think I'm gonna go to a gay cocktail party stag, do you?\\
60 - The way I sparkle?\\
61 - I'm not going to be your gay lover so you can make a few bucks.\\
62 - Okay, first of all, it's considerably more than a few bucks.\\
63 - This man was responsible for almost half my income last year.\\
64 - And that's the half I didn't gamble away.\\
65 - And second of all, you're not just my lover...\\
66 - ...you're my life partner. That makes you special.\\
67 - Forget it. It's immoral and deceitful, and I don't want any part of it.\\
68 - What's the big deal? Gay people pretend to be straight.\\
69 - They don't wanna be discriminated.\\
70 - And neither do I. The minute this guy finds out I'm a breeder, I'm history.\\
71 - I don't care. If you wanna engage in a fraudulent escapade...\\
72 - ...have one of your oafish poker buddies be your partner.\\
73 - You see? You see? Right there. Escapade. Oafish.\\
74 - What poker buddy of mine talks like that?\\
75 - But you, a couple of squirts of Paco Rabanne, you're good to go.\\
76 - Having a reasonable command of English...\\
77 - ...isn't the exclusive domain of the gay community.\\
78 - Listen to you. You're just making my point.\\
79 - Forget it. You're asking too much.\\
80 - Oh, really?\\
81 - Was it too much when you showed up on my doorstep, looking for a place?\\
82 - - Charlie. - Too much when I took in...\\
83 - ...your son on weekends and holidays? - This isn't fair.\\
84 - Too much when I set up a college fund for Jake?\\
85 - - You set up a college fund for Jake? - You bet I will.\\
86 - Unless, of course, my income were to suddenly decline.\\
87 - I can't believe you would sink so low.\\
88 - To actually use emotional and financial blackmail...\\
89 - - You're both in my will. - Really?\\
90 - First thing Monday.\\
91 - All right. But I want it on the record...\\
92 - ...I'm doing this under protest. - Noted.\\
93 - If we're gonna be a couple, I'm the husband.\\
94 - Well, who's gonna believe you're the husband?\\
95 - Of the two of us, I'm the only one who's been a husband.\\
96 - You really thought you were the husband in your marriage?\\
97 - Nevertheless, I'm going to be the husband in this one.\\
98 - Well, la-di-da.\\
99 - - Thanks for babysitting, Rose. - My pleasure.\\
100 - Where are you guys going?\\
101 - To a little party.\\
102 - And you're taking Alan instead of a date?\\
103 - Yeah, well, funny story about that.\\
104 - Okay, let's get this over with.\\
105 - You're wearing that?\\
106 - What's wrong with it? You liked it in the store.\\
107 - It looked different in the store.\\
108 - Well, it was on sale. I can't return it.\\
109 - - Dad, can we order pizza for dinner? - No. Eat something healthy.\\
110 - You want me to change, just tell me.\\
111 - - Don't change. - You don't like it.\\
112 - I didn't say that.\\
113 - I think you look very nice, Alan.\\
114 - Thank you. See? That's all I needed to hear.\\
115 - - Well, you heard it. Now, come on. - You know, I'm only doing this for you.\\
116 - - I know. - Could you show a little appreciation?\\
117 - How about I show you a little smack on the head?\\
118 - That's your answer for everything, isn't it?\\
119 - What is that about?\\
120 - I don't know, but one of them suffers from erectile dysfunction.\\
121 - Dad said we could order a pizza.\\
122 - Would you please not walk so far in front of me? I'm not your concubine.\\
123 - I'm sorry.\\
124 - What, are you ashamed of me?\\
125 - A little bit.\\
126 - Oh, boy. Charlie, we need to talk.\\
127 - For the last time, you look stunning.\\
128 - No, we... We need to get our stories straight.\\
129 - - What stories? - We're a couple.\\
130 - How long have we been together? How did we meet?\\
131 - Okay, fine. I met you in Thailand and bought you from a guy.\\
132 - I'm serious. If we're gonna pull this off, we need to be convincing.\\
133 - A favorite song? Cute names for each other?\\
134 - I mean, I don't even know if we're dog people or cat people.\\
135 - I forgot to tell you: The guy I bought you from had your vocal chords removed.\\
136 - - Charlie. I'm so glad you could make it. - Oh, please. How could I not?\\
137 - And you must be Alan. Welcome.\\
138 - I'm the husband.\\
139 - No, he's not. Stop saying that.\\
140 - Listen to you two ladies. Come on. I'll get you a drink.\\
141 - Appletinis.\\
142 - So how did you lovebirds meet?\\
143 - Funny you should ask. We were at the Coffee Bean...\\
144 - ...you know, the one in Larchmont Village, where the pastries are to die for.\\
145 - Anyway, we both ordered a soy latte...\\
146 - ...when the first one came up, we both reached for it, and our hands touched.\\
147 - Oh, that is so romantic.\\
148 - Yeah, it was one of those moments that seems to go on forever.\\
149 - Like this one.\\
150 - - Are you starting? - No.\\
151 - Because I swear to God, I will walk out that door and get in a cab.\\
152 - - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, what?\\
153 - I'm sorry...\\
154 - ...pookie.\\
155 - Finish your story, Alan.\\
156 - Well, okay. So... So there we are...\\
157 - ...our hands are touching, and we look into each other's eyes...\\
158 - ...this one panics, spills coffee over one of his hideous bowling shirts.\\
159 - The only gay man in America who dresses like Ralph Kramden.\\
160 - To the moon, Alan.\\
161 - Anyhoo, so I took him back to my condo to "hand wash his shirt"...\\
162 - ...and, abracadabra, hocus-pocus, here we are.\\
163 - - That's a delicious story. - Yeah, isn't it yummy?\\
164 - Yeah, it kills me every time.\\
165 - There's someone you just have to meet. Don't go away.\\
166 - Okey-dokey, artichokey.\\
167 - You've gotta pull back a little. You're gonna set off the smoke alarm.\\
168 - - What do you mean? - I mean, if you flame any more...\\
169 - ...you'll light the drapes on fire.\\
170 - What about you? "Okey-dokey, artichokey"?\\
171 - What are you, the Jolly Gay Giant?\\
172 - I want you both to meet someone very special to me. Charlie, Alan...\\
173 - ...this is my very patient and very forgiving ex-wife, Pamela.\\
174 - - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.\\
175 - Hi. Wow, you were married?\\
176 - It was before I'd gotten a grip on my sexuality.\\
177 - But not before you got a grip on my cousin Walt.\\
178 - Well, I can see why you gave marriage a shot.\\
179 - Pamela, you are a breathtakingly beautiful woman.\\
180 - Why, thank you, Charlie.\\
181 - Why do all the cute ones have to be married or gay?\\
182 - Back off, sister. I caught this fish.\\
183 - - Gonna tell me what's bothering you? - lf you don't know, no point discussing.\\
184 - Fine.\\
185 - You ignored me the whole night.\\
186 - A party where I don't know anyone, and you abandoned me.\\
187 - Alan, listen closely.\\
188 - It wasn't a real date.\\
189 - Not the point. I was stuck playing truth or dare...\\
190 - ...with your friend Eric and nine producers from Will & Grace...\\
191 - ...while you had a wonderful time talking to his hot ex-wife.\\
192 - - I was just being polite. - Oh, please.\\
193 - - I saw the way you were looking at her. - What, I can't look?\\
194 - Not when you're supposed to be with me.\\
195 - How many appletinis did you drink tonight?\\
196 - Never you mind about that. So... So, what are you gonna do?\\
197 - Out yourself as a straight man so you can sleep with your little Pamela?\\
198 - No, no. That would mess everything up with Eric.\\
199 - Unless I convince him...\\
200 - ...that she temporarily flipped me back to the home team.\\
201 - Oh, if you're gonna go, just go.\\
202 - Alan, eat something. Toast, a waffle. Anything absorbent.\\
203 - Don't blame this on the liquor.\\
204 - Okay, here's what I can do.\\
205 - She and I are going shopping tomorrow.\\
206 - I'll tell her I'm bisexual, and then make my move.\\
207 - So you're gonna cheat on me?\\
208 - No, that's not cheating.\\
209 - - How do you figure? - Because we're not really gay.\\
210 - Then how can you be bi?\\
211 - Shut up.\\
212 - Okay, well, good night.\\
213 - - Aren't you gonna ask? - No. Jake told me.\\
214 - Oh, this is a cute top.\\
215 - I'm more a bottom man myself.\\
216 - I'll bet you are.\\
217 - - Too slutty? - Haven't you heard?\\
218 - Slutty is the new black.\\
219 - Oh, you.\\
220 - Is there some special, young vagina enthusiast you'll be taking that off for?\\
221 - I wish. Can you keep a little secret?\\
222 - I'm keeping a big one right now.\\
223 - I haven't been with a man in almost a year.\\
224 - Oh, no. Color me sympathetic.\\
225 - I don't miss dating. That's lies and pretense. I do miss the sex.\\
226 - Really? Well, what, specifically, do you miss? And tell me slowly.\\
227 - The feel of a man's hot breath on the back of my neck.\\
228 - His rough hands pulling me to him and just taking me.\\
229 - Of course, I don't need to tell you.\\
230 - No, but I'm so glad you did.\\
231 - Isn't it funny that I can only be this honest with a gay man?\\
232 - Yeah, it's a riot.\\
233 - Straight men only want one thing, and they'll tell any number of lies to get it.\\
234 - - The dogs. - Straight women are so competitive...\\
235 - ...they'll use anything you say against you.\\
236 - The bitches.\\
237 - Gay women only want one thing, and they'll lie worse than straight men.\\
238 - Strange, because they've already got it.\\
239 - Oh, you, come here.\\
240 - Oh, that's the other thing about gay men. You're so hilarious.\\
241 - Yeah, we're like clowns who smell nice.\\
242 - You know, these are pretty.\\
243 - It's pretty sheer. Eric hated it when he could see my nipples. That a gay thing?\\
244 - Well, I can't speak for the community, but I myself am nutty for nipples.\\
245 - Let's try it on.\\
246 - Okey-dokey, artichokey.\\
247 - All right. Hold this.\\
248 - Okay.\\
249 - What do you think? With or without the bra?\\
250 - I don't know. You're the one with nipple issues.\\
251 - All right, then. Without.\\
252 - Yes. Definitely without.\\
253 - Am I starting to sag?\\
254 - What... I'm sorry, were you talking to me?\\
255 - Am I hanging a bit low?\\
256 - I don't know. Go like this:\\
257 - - Now go like this: - Stop it. Give me the blouse.\\
258 - I am a woman, Charles.\\
259 - - Wanna see my nipples? - No.\\
260 - Why not? You made me look at yours.\\
261 - God, you are so frisky. How does Alan ever put up with you?\\
262 - How does his mother put up with him?\\
263 - Oh, boy.\\
264 - Charles, didn't I ask you to confine your debauchery to outlet stores?\\
265 - Pamela, this is my mother, Evelyn. Mom, this is Pamela.\\
266 - - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Your son is adorable.\\
267 - That seems to be the conventional wisdom.\\
268 - I met him and his partner last night, but we immediately hit it off.\\
269 - - I'm sorry. His partner? - Alan, his lover.\\
270 - His lover?\\
271 - God, I'm not outing you, am I?\\
272 - Oh, no, no, no. Mom knows all about me and Alan. Right, Mom?\\
273 - Of course. Alan's almost like a son to me.\\
274 - My ex's parents were not supportive when he came out of the closet.\\
275 - Oh, what a shame. What does he do?\\
276 - He's in advertising. Charlie writes jingles for him.\\
277 - Oh, I see. One hand moisturizes the other.\\
278 - No, the only time Charlie was ever in the closet...\\
279 - ...was when he was a little boy trying on my hats and underwear...\\
280 - ...belting out the entire score of Hello, Dolly!\\
281 - It was Mame, Mom.\\
282 - In fact, if anything, his lifestyle has brought us even closer.\\
283 - We cook together, we shop together...\\
284 - ...we go to all kinds of parties and charity events together.\\
285 - Come to think of it, I have entered us in an Alzheimer's walkathon this Sunday.\\
286 - Sunday isn't really good for me.\\
287 - But you will be there anyway...\\
288 - ...because we support each other in all our little causes, and you love me. Right?\\
289 - Right.\\
290 - Say it.\\
291 - I love you, Mom.\\
292 - And I love you too.\\
293 - Eight a.m. Sunday.\\
294 - I'll buy us matching tracksuits. It'll be cute.\\
295 - - Lovely to meet you, Pamela. - Bye.\\
296 - If I didn't know you were gay, meeting your mother would've convinced me.\\
297 - Okay, that's it. I can't do this anymore.\\
298 - You can't stop shopping. I've gotta find you something slutty.\\
299 - I've already got something slutty in my pants.\\
300 - - You're terrible. - Pamela, listen to me.\\
301 - I'm not gay. I am completely, 100 percent, militantly heterosexual...\\
302 - ...and I find you incredibly attractive. - Okay. I understand.\\
303 - - You do? - Of course. I went through this with Eric.\\
304 - He wanted badly to be straight, and he suffered so much before...\\
305 - ...he was able to finally accept himself for who he is.\\
306 - Oh, no. I accept myself for who I am. I am a lying horndog.\\
307 - - Charlie. - lf I were a straight man...\\
308 - ...would you find me attractive? - That's hypothetical.\\
309 - Play along. Humor me. If I were straight...\\
310 - I'd do you in a heartbeat.\\
311 - Oh, good. Come with me.\\
312 - Charlie, don't do this. You don't have to prove anything.\\
313 - Oh, but I do.\\
314 - Now, come here.\\
315 - You don't have to be straight to be a good kisser.\\
316 - I know, I know. Just wait.\\
317 - Well...?\\
318 - Give me a minute. I'm under some pressure here. I just saw my mother.\\
319 - Would it help if you thought of Alan?\\
320 - Oh, great. Why don't you just roll up a newspaper and hit it?\\
321 - Charlie, sweetheart, it's okay.\\
322 - No, it's not. I am a straight man.\\
323 - I've always been a straight man, and I'll always be a straight man.\\
324 - Well, you'll forgive me, darling, but you seem to have a gay man's penis.\\
325 - Come on, let's go look at shoes.\\
326 - It's a straight man's penis. It's just having a bad day.\\
327 - - Hey. - Oh, I thought you'd never come home.\\
328 - - We have to talk. - Not now.\\
329 - I need to drink beer, scratch my ass...\\
330 - ...and watch a whole bunch of girl-on-girl porn.\\
331 - - Hello, Charlie. - Eric. What are you doing here?\\
332 - I came over to talk to you about a new account, and you weren't here, so...\\
333 - So he invited me to Big Sur for the weekend.\\
334 - It's not what it sounds like.\\
335 - Yes, it is. He looked into my eyes, told me I had a tight little breadbasket.\\
336 - No.\\
337 - Look, the other night at the party, there was a lot of friction between you...\\
338 - ...and I'm really sorry.\\
339 - Yeah, I'll bet you're really sorry.\\
340 - How do you expect me to keep working for you?\\
341 - Gosh, I hope you will. I'll make it up to you.\\
342 - How? How could you possibly make up for this incredible betrayal?\\
343 - - I'll get you more money. - Done. Get out.\\
344 - Bye, Alan.\\
345 - Thanks for the sweater.\\
346 - - He gave you a sweater? - Cashmere. Very stylish. And thank you.\\
347 - - For what? I didn't get you anything. - You stood up for our relationship.\\
348 - What relationship? Alan, we're not gay.\\
349 - No, but if we were, you wouldn't let anybody steal me away.\\
350 - And I think that's sweet.\\
351 - You need to stop this.\\
352 - I was just trying to get more money out of him, and that's all.\\
353 - Whatever you say. Pookie.\\
354 - Is the breadbasket the front or the back?\\
355 - - The back. - Oh, good. It wasn't just a line.\\
356 - Pick it up, Charlie. We're lagging.\\
357 - Gimme a break. I haven't even been to bed yet.\\
358 - Well, perhaps it's time for you to reexamine your club-hopping...\\
359 - ...popper-sniffing, disco lifestyle.\\
360 - I explained about that.\\
361 - It doesn't matter, darling. You're here, you're queer. I'm used to it.
\subsection {Episode 19: A Low Guttural Tongue-Flapping Noise}
1 - Can't we just go home?\\
2 - If I gotta drag you to the doctor at 8 in the morning...\\
3 - ...you can cool your jets while I get coffee.\\
4 - I must look like an idiot.\\
5 - Wish I could tell you different.\\
6 - You're the reason we went to the eye doctor in the first place.\\
7 - You said, "Throw me a piece of toast."\\
8 - I threw you a piece of toast.\\
9 - Two cups of regular coffee, please.\\
10 - - My treat. - Oh, that makes up for everything.\\
11 - Pigeons can feed out of my eye socket, but I get a free cup of coffee.\\
12 - Just the coffee. Keep the change.\\
13 - I'm gonna need your help until I get this patch off.\\
14 - I am absolutely there for you.\\
15 - Great.\\
16 - Great. So...\\
17 - So you'll drive me to work, pick me up, get Jake at school...\\
18 - ...do the grocery shopping... - Okay, I may have misspoken.\\
19 - Charlie, you have to. You know I can't drive.\\
20 - I don't see why not.\\
21 - - Oh, look who's here. - Who?\\
22 - A girl I used to go out with. Over there.\\
23 - Hey, Sherri.\\
24 - - Hey, Charlie, long time. - Yeah. Good to see you.\\
25 - - This is my brother, Alan. - Hi.\\
26 - - Hi. - What happened to your eye?\\
27 - Well, I wanted a piece of toast, and...\\
28 - Bar fight.\\
29 - - Nice to meet you. - Well, nice meeting you too.\\
30 - - Good to see you, Charlie. - Good to see you too.\\
31 - - Wow, you went out with her? - Yep.\\
32 - Why would you stop?\\
33 - I don't remember. I probably got bored.\\
34 - Bored? How do you get bored with that?\\
35 - For every beautiful woman, there's at least one guy out there...\\
36 - ...who's tired of pretending to listen to her in exchange for sex.\\
37 - Well, let me go on record as saying, I am not that guy.\\
38 - If I ever had a woman like that, I would cherish her.\\
39 - I would worship her. I would...\\
40 - ...start a small country and put her face on a stamp so I could lick her head.\\
41 - - Why don't you go talk to her. - Yeah, right.\\
42 - Gorgeous women like that are not interested in pasty guys like me...\\
43 - ...unless we're in line for the British throne.\\
44 - - So you give up without even trying? - Yep. That's my motto.\\
45 - Why waste time on 10s when you're already getting rejected by sixes?\\
46 - Alan, listen to me. You are a smart, sensitive, good-Iooking man...\\
47 - ...with some milky discharge coming out of one eye...\\
48 - ...but who amongst us is perfect?\\
49 - That's the other thing. Look at me. I'm a mess.\\
50 - So? Women like Sherri have big, hunky guys hitting on them all day long.\\
51 - A guy like you walks up, makes a move, you know what that says to her?\\
52 - Trick or treat?\\
53 - It says, "I'm confident in who I am."\\
54 - - You think? - I know.\\
55 - So, what if she's not interested. What's the worst that could happen?\\
56 - Actually, the worst that could happen is she points at me...\\
57 - ...and laughs, causing every seventh grader in the cafeteria to turn...\\
58 - ...and watch me slink back to the geek table...\\
59 - ...with a growing wet spot on the front of my chinos.\\
60 - We ninth graders enjoyed it also.\\
61 - But you're not in junior high anymore, and you're not a...\\
62 - You're not in junior high anymore.\\
63 - - It's time to let go of those fears. - I don't know.\\
64 - Oh, come on, Alan.\\
65 - For once in your life, don't settle. Go for what you really want.\\
66 - You know what? You're right. I'm gonna go talk to her.\\
67 - Hold on.\\
68 - Let's clean some of that discharge.\\
69 - You wanna say "I'm confident," not "I'm infectious."\\
70 - There. Go get her.\\
71 - Hey, you see that guy over there? Twenty bucks says he wets himself.\\
72 - - Hello. - Hi.\\
73 - - Alan? - I remember.\\
74 - Look, I needed to come clean about something.\\
75 - I wasn't actually in a bar fight.\\
76 - I took a piece of whole-wheat toast to the eye.\\
77 - I mean, it was cut diagonally and toasted well...\\
78 - ...so it was essentially shrapnel.\\
79 - Did some real damage.\\
80 - I see. And why do you feel the need to tell me all this?\\
81 - Well, I guess I didn't want our relationship to start on a lie.\\
82 - Our relationship?\\
83 - - I'll go now. - No, no, wait.\\
84 - Sit down. Join me.\\
85 - Okay.\\
86 - - That's it. I'm out. - Oh, come on.\\
87 - No, no, no. No more.\\
88 - You got a date. Leave it alone.\\
89 - Not just a date. A date with...\\
90 - Enough.\\
91 - - I'd think you'd be happy for me. - I am happy for you.\\
92 - You had the courage to walk over...\\
93 - ...with your pus-filled eye and fall on your ass...\\
94 - ...and still got a date with one of the most beautiful women I've ever met.\\
95 - - I'm not only happy for you, I'm proud. - Thank you.\\
96 - Now, I have to re-evaluate everything I thought I knew...\\
97 - ...about men, women, relationships, God and the universe.\\
98 - But that's not your problem.\\
99 - Charlie, I am as surprised as you that she said yes.\\
100 - I don't think so.\\
101 - I was really intimidated, but as it turns out, she's just like a regular person...\\
102 - ...except for, you know, being from the planet:\\
103 - Alan, never do that around me again.\\
104 - You know, actually, we have a lot in common.\\
105 - Okay. I'll bite.\\
106 - Well, we both went through tough divorces.\\
107 - - Sherri was married? - You didn't know that?\\
108 - - It never came up. - What did come up?\\
109 - Never mind. Scratch that.\\
110 - Where should I take her to dinner?\\
111 - Where did you go so I can take her somewhere else?\\
112 - Last thing you want is for her to start comparing you to me.\\
113 - Exactly.\\
114 - Wait.\\
115 - What do you mean?\\
116 - You want your relationship to stand on its own.\\
117 - - Right. - Well, that's what I meant.\\
118 - Okay. I thought you were trying to rub my nose in the fact that you dated her.\\
119 - Alan, I would never do that.\\
120 - Well, thank you.\\
121 - I don't have to.\\
122 - You think you could kill a guy with a piece of toast?\\
123 - No.\\
124 - Because if you did, you could eat the toast.\\
125 - The police would never find the weapon. It's the perfect crime.\\
126 - And part of a nutritious breakfast.\\
127 - Okay, guys, I guess I'll see you later.\\
128 - Where you going?\\
129 - - Out for dinner. - With who?\\
130 - Jake, look, I think...\\
131 - I think you're old enough to know that your dad's not just a dad.\\
132 - He's also a man and that...\\
133 - ...even though I'm not married to your mom...\\
134 - ...I still enjoy the company of women...\\
135 - ...which means that I will occasionally go out with one.\\
136 - But the important thing for you to understand...\\
137 - ...is that I am not trying to replace your mother.\\
138 - In fact, no one can replace your mother.\\
139 - I bet you could kill a guy with a piece of bacon.\\
140 - All right, then. I'm glad we had this talk.\\
141 - I'm gonna go post my plan on the Internet.\\
142 - You know, there's moments around here...\\
143 - ...that make me wish I had a son of my own.\\
144 - That wasn't one of them.\\
145 - Yeah, well. Anyway, I really appreciate you watching him tonight.\\
146 - No problem.\\
147 - - How you getting to the restaurant? - Sherri's picking me up.\\
148 - - Very convenient. - Why?\\
149 - Because she's been here before? Been here with you?\\
150 - Because you've had sex with her in every room in the house?\\
151 - No, because you can't drive.\\
152 - But it's interesting to see how your mind works.\\
153 - Alan, let me give you some advice.\\
154 - Alcohol impairs your ability to make good decisions.\\
155 - We don't want you to lose that ability. We want her to.\\
156 - Of course. Very good.\\
157 - What else?\\
158 - Well, women like Sherri already know they're beautiful and desirable.\\
159 - - You won't score points by telling her. - Okay.\\
160 - Don't be in a hurry to spill your guts.\\
161 - She doesn't need your life story...\\
162 - ...before you get the salad. - Got it.\\
163 - As someone who knows your life story, I'd say she doesn't need to hear it at all.\\
164 - Right, right. I'll be cool, aloof, distant.\\
165 - She's here, she's here, she's here!\\
166 - What about the... What... What...\\
167 - What about the kiss goodnight?\\
168 - - Should I ask or just go for it? - Go for it.\\
169 - Don't wait until the last minute. It creates pressure.\\
170 - - Get it out of the way early. - How early?\\
171 - After dinner, when you walk to the car...\\
172 - ...open her door, wait for her to say thank you...\\
173 - ...smile, lean in, and kiss her.\\
174 - Oh, nice.\\
175 - Hi, Alan. You ready?\\
176 - You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, and I don't deserve you.\\
177 - That's another way to go.\\
178 - - Madam. - Thank you.\\
179 - - Sir. - Oh, thank you.\\
180 - - Would you like the wine list? - No.\\
181 - I'll have the Woodbridge Pinot Noir. Or should we get a bottle?\\
182 - Oh, definitely get a bottle.\\
183 - Coffee for me.\\
184 - You know, Sherri, I'd really like to see more of you.\\
185 - Maybe we should wait and see how tonight goes.\\
186 - No, I mean, I've only got one good eye. Could we change places?\\
187 - Oh, sure.\\
188 - - Are you okay? - Oh, yes, yes. Fine.\\
189 - - This is a nice place. - Yeah.\\
190 - It's my favorite.\\
191 - You ever come here with Charlie?\\
192 - I don't know. Probably.\\
193 - He's a big steak-eater.\\
194 - I'm more of a fish guy. You know, I'm surf, he's turf.\\
195 - And we're cops.\\
196 - - You're very cute. - You too.\\
197 - All right. So tell me about yourself.\\
198 - Well, there's not a lot to tell.\\
199 - I was San Fernando Valley Chiropractor of the Year...\\
200 - ...if you follow that kind of thing.\\
201 - Recently divorced.\\
202 - But not too recently. I've already had my rebound, transitional relationships.\\
203 - - So no worries there. - Good to know.\\
204 - Actually, it wasn't so much a relationship...\\
205 - ...as a case of mistaken identity, but I think it still counts.\\
206 - - Okay. - And...\\
207 - ...as you know, I live with Charlie...\\
208 - ...whom you've already...\\
209 - - Met? - Yeah, let's go with met.\\
210 - Alan, is my having dated Charlie gonna be a problem for you?\\
211 - No, no, no. A little.\\
212 - Okay, look. Charlie and l...\\
213 - We had a very brief, superficial relationship.\\
214 - Okay? And to be honest, it was mostly about sex.\\
215 - Great.\\
216 - My point is, yeah, I'm tired of those, those shallow relationships...\\
217 - ...I was having with guys like Charlie.\\
218 - I wanna be with a man who can be sensitive and caring, nurturing.\\
219 - You know, somebody who can make me laugh, make me think.\\
220 - You do realize I'm straight, right?\\
221 - - See, you really are adorable. - Thank you.\\
222 - I tend to bring out the mothering instinct in women.\\
223 - - Oh, really? - Ironically, not my mother.\\
224 - What the hell are you doing?\\
225 - Check it out. Ninja death toast.\\
226 - Okay, stop it, stop it.\\
227 - You're in no position to give orders, Mr. Harper.\\
228 - - Morning. - Morning.\\
229 - - Death toast? - Oh, thank you.\\
230 - - So how did it go last night? - Fine.\\
231 - That's it? Fine?\\
232 - Charlie, we're not in high school anymore. I'm not gonna go into detail.\\
233 - - Okay, don't tell me. - Jake, go watch TV.\\
234 - - I'm still hungry. - There's bread all over the living room.\\
235 - All right.\\
236 - - Well? - It went great.\\
237 - She said I'm adorable. She thinks I'm nurturing, caring and sensitive.\\
238 - - I'm exactly what she's looking for. - She's looking for a half-blind sheepdog?\\
239 - She invited me to her house for dinner tonight.\\
240 - - I think she wants to have sex. - With who?\\
241 - - With me. - With you.\\
242 - Hang on a second.\\
243 - Nope. No snowballs reported in hell.\\
244 - No sightings of flying pigs.\\
245 - - What am I gonna do? - You don't know?\\
246 - Come on, Alan, you were married for 12 years.\\
247 - What does marriage have to do with sex?\\
248 - Point taken. Okay, you want some tips?\\
249 - No, no, nothing like that.\\
250 - I need step-by-step instructions.\\
251 - All right. Since this is your first bout in this weight class...\\
252 - ...I'd say stick with the basics.\\
253 - Better to do the simple stuff well than the fancy stuff badly.\\
254 - Got it. And the simple stuff would be...\\
255 - Well, you know how women like you to go slow?\\
256 - Really? My ex-wife put a premium on brevity.\\
257 - Her motto was, " Less is more, and none is perfect."\\
258 - Well, Sherri's not like that. You're gonna wanna take your time.\\
259 - - I can do that. - But don't loiter either.\\
260 - You don't want her to get bored and play solitaire on your head.\\
261 - No loitering. Got it.\\
262 - - Something else? - Okay.\\
263 - When you're with a woman like Sherri, who's so gosh-darn beautiful...\\
264 - ...that you get excited just thinking about her...\\
265 - ...how do you keep the sprinklers from going off while you're still mowing?\\
266 - Let me make sure I understand.\\
267 - You wanna keep your toothpaste in the tube until you're done brushing.\\
268 - What are you talking about?\\
269 - - What are you talking about? - Okay, okay. Let me try again.\\
270 - I don't wanna frost the cake while I'm still mixing the batter.\\
271 - I don't get it. She must have lost a bet.\\
272 - - Excuse me? - Nothing.\\
273 - All right. Here's what you do.\\
274 - When you feel like the train is leaving the station...\\
275 - You mean, going in the tunnel?\\
276 - No, no, I mean leaving the station.\\
277 - But you have to leave the station to get to the tunnel.\\
278 - Okay, okay.\\
279 - Let's start from the top.\\
280 - And work our way down, right?\\
281 - You know what? Just shut up and listen.\\
282 - When you're making love, the way to slow yourself down is...\\
283 - ...to think of something completely non-sexual.\\
284 - - Well, what do you think of? - You.\\
285 - That was a really great dinner.\\
286 - I'm glad you enjoyed it. You ready for dessert?\\
287 - I've been ready since I was 14.\\
288 - I'll be back. Why don't you put some music on.\\
289 - Okay.\\
290 - Hey, how about Diana Krall?\\
291 - Oh, actually, that's your brother's CD. Do you mind bringing it back to him?\\
292 - Not at all.\\
293 - I think I have one of his T-shirts. You might as well take that too.\\
294 - No problem.\\
295 - Hey, this is a cool, little CD player.\\
296 - Oh, thanks. It was a gift from your... It was a gift.\\
297 - Perfect.\\
298 - Is there anything else Charlie left behind?\\
299 - Just me.\\
300 - My brother's a fool.\\
301 - No argument here.\\
302 - - That is a very effective neglig e. - Thank you.\\
303 - - Was it a gift? - No.\\
304 - - As a matter of fact, I bought it myself. - Oh, good.\\
305 - - How long ago? - What?\\
306 - Well, I was just wondering if Charlie saw it.\\
307 - Alan, don't go there.\\
308 - Oh, I wasn't going anywhere. It's just that...\\
309 - - Nothing. More kissing. - Okay, okay.\\
310 - What exactly is bothering you?\\
311 - Well, it's kind of hard to explain.\\
312 - For example, once, when Charlie and I were at camp...\\
313 - ...I lost my swim trunks, and I had to wear an old pair of Charlie's, and...\\
314 - ...I just couldn't enjoy the pool at all.\\
315 - So, what are you saying? I'm a pair of used swim trunks?\\
316 - No, no. In this case, I think you would be the pool.\\
317 - Maybe this was a bad idea.\\
318 - No, no, it's a great idea. It's right up there...\\
319 - ...with the wheel, fire and refrigerators that give ice through the door.\\
320 - - Sorry. I don't wanna do this anymore. - What? Why?\\
321 - You can't be with me without it being some competition with your brother.\\
322 - It's not a competition.\\
323 - And even it was, shouldn't we do it first before you decide who wins?\\
324 - You are unbelievable.\\
325 - - That could be taken a couple of ways. - Get out.\\
326 - Well, no ambiguity there.\\
327 - Don't forget your brother's CD.\\
328 - My eye!\\
329 - Man, I love sunsets.\\
330 - The way the sky is streaked with color. It's amazing.\\
331 - It's the pollution that makes those pretty colors, you know.\\
332 - What you're enjoying is the effect of light passing through airborne poison.\\
333 - No, that's not what I'm really enjoying.\\
334 - Boy, I hope that's guacamole.
\subsection {Episode 20: I Always Wanted a Shaved Monkey}
1 - - You got a date tonight? - No.\\
2 - Aren't you gonna ask me if I do?\\
3 - Okay. You got a date tonight?\\
4 - Sure, rub my nose in it.\\
5 - Besides, I'd rather hang out with you and Jake...\\
6 - ...than engage in mindless conversation with some strange woman...\\
7 - ...in the desperate hope that she might sleep with me.\\
8 - Me too.\\
9 - If we can't lie to each other, who can we lie to?\\
10 - To family.\\
11 - - Who is it? - It's Mom.\\
12 - Oh, odds.\\
13 - - Once, twice, three, shoot. - Once, twice, three, shoot.\\
14 - Hey, Mom.\\
15 - No, I don't have a date tonight.\\
16 - Don't you wanna know about Alan?\\
17 - So, what's up?\\
18 - Yes, I got your message.\\
19 - I was gonna call you back, but...\\
20 - I was.\\
21 - I was.\\
22 - I was.\\
23 - Okay, I wasn't.\\
24 - I'm sorry.\\
25 - And do you wanna tell me why you called?\\
26 - I said, I'm sorry.\\
27 - I am sorry. I am. I am.\\
28 - All right, I'm not.\\
29 - So, what's up? Tomorrow?\\
30 - Yeah, sure. One of us will be here.\\
31 - I'll be here.\\
32 - All right, gotta go. Love you.\\
33 - No, I'm not just saying that.\\
34 - I'm not.\\
35 - No, I'm not.\\
36 - Mom, we both know where this going.\\
37 - - Sorry to stick you with her. - Yeah, sure.\\
38 - - I am. - Right.\\
39 - - I am. - Whatever.\\
40 - Okay, I'm not.\\
41 - Schmuck.\\
42 - For 30 years, every time I call odds, he throws a two, and I'm the schmuck.\\
43 - - Hey, buddy. - Hey, Dad.\\
44 - - Here's the bill for Jake's class trip. - Why give it to me?\\
45 - - So you can pay it. - Me?\\
46 - What's the point of giving child support...\\
47 - ...if you don't support the child?\\
48 - Child support doesn't cover class trips.\\
49 - - Says who? - You wanna make an issue of this?\\
50 - Have your lawyer call mine. They can decide who pays for class trips.\\
51 - Oh, I'm sorry. Class trips?\\
52 - I'm happy to pay for class trips.\\
53 - I thought you said "ass clips."\\
54 - What are ass clips?\\
55 - I don't know, but I don't intend to pay for them.\\
56 - Goodbye, Alan.\\
57 - At least we settled who pays for ass clips around here.\\
58 - Okay, Mom. Good talking to you.\\
59 - I'm gonna hang up now.\\
60 - Yes, I am.\\
61 - I am.\\
62 - Okay, I'm not.\\
63 - - Jake's here. - Cool.\\
64 - It wouldn't kill you to talk to Mom once in a while.\\
65 - We don't know that.\\
66 - - Besides, you lost fair and square. - I don't think so.\\
67 - - I think you cheated. - At odds and evens?\\
68 - How on earth does one cheat at odds and evens?\\
69 - Don't give me that big, cow-eyed, aw-shucks, Howdy Doody veneer.\\
70 - - What? - You heard me.\\
71 - Yeah, I heard you...\\
72 - ...and as long as we're stringing random words together...\\
73 - ...shoebox, MoonPie, Band-Aid.\\
74 - Let me tell you something, Alan, and I say this with no agenda.\\
75 - I am not a judgmental person, but you, you are a horrible little man.\\
76 - You smile, tell everybody what they wanna hear...\\
77 - ...but I know what goes on inside your grinning puppet head.\\
78 - You don't have a clue what's going on inside my puppet head...\\
79 - ...because to know that, you would have to be capable of...\\
80 - ...perceiving the world that exists beyond the tip of your penis.\\
81 - Don't talk about my penis. You have not earned the right.\\
82 - You are a selfish man, Charlie. You're a user.\\
83 - You just suckle from the teat of life and you never give back.\\
84 - "Suckle from the teat of life"?\\
85 - Who are you, Henry Wadsworth Pinhead?\\
86 - - You call me that because I'm right. - I call you that...\\
87 - ...because you can wear a thimble as a hat.\\
88 - Hey, what's going on?\\
89 - - Nothing. - Just hanging out.\\
90 - Cool.\\
91 - You know, if you guys were queer...\\
92 - ...we'd be what they'd call an alternated family.\\
93 - - Morning. - Morning.\\
94 - I feel bad about last night.\\
95 - That's okay. I forgive you.\\
96 - I didn't apologize.\\
97 - Well, then I guess I'm just a bigger man than you are.\\
98 - I'm kidding. Forget about it.\\
99 - Okay.\\
100 - - What do you wanna do with Jake? - I don't know. How about a barbecue?\\
101 - Well, I'm sure the kid's delicious, but I think I'd rather have hamburgers.\\
102 - Dad, check it out. Mom bought me new shoes.\\
103 - - Very cool. - Yeah, they were really expensive.\\
104 - - I'll bet. - She said to give you the bill.\\
105 - What? Why do I get the bill?\\
106 - So you can give me a check to pay her back.\\
107 - - Why? - She doesn't trust me with cash.\\
108 - No. Why should I be buying your shoes?\\
109 - You didn't. Mom did.\\
110 - This is so wrong. I send her a child support check every month...\\
111 - ...which is supposed to include things like clothing, food, shoes.\\
112 - Alan, you're like an Alzheimer's victim in a whorehouse.\\
113 - Excuse me?\\
114 - You're constantly surprised that you've been screwed...\\
115 - ...and you don't wanna pay for it.\\
116 - - Morning. - Morning.\\
117 - Did you drop off the dry cleaning by the back door?\\
118 - That was dry cleaning?\\
119 - I thought you were throwing that stuff out.\\
120 - You threw out my clothes?\\
121 - I gave them to my sister's husband, Earl.\\
122 - You gave three cashmere sweaters and a new sport coat to your brother-in-law?\\
123 - Why shouldn't he have nice things?\\
124 - He's paid his debt to society.\\
125 - You have to get them back.\\
126 - I wish I could, but Earl's got one withered arm...\\
127 - ...and he had all the left sleeves hemmed.\\
128 - Those were expensive clothes, Berta.\\
129 - Wanna take it out in trade, stud?\\
130 - Because this back brace snaps off with the flick of a wrist.\\
131 - Okay, okay, that's the last straw.\\
132 - You have abused my good nature for too long, and I am putting my foot down.\\
133 - Well, you let me know how that works out for you.\\
134 - I guess we know who's in charge around here.\\
135 - If I want your opinion, I'll ask your ex-wife.\\
136 - Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Well, if I want your opinion...\\
137 - ...I'll ask one of the dozens of women you have meaningless casual sex with.\\
138 - Oh, ouch.\\
139 - - Hey, Uncle Charlie? - What?\\
140 - - I love you. - What did you do, Jake?\\
141 - I love you too, Dad.\\
142 - - What did he do? - How am I supposed to know?\\
143 - Well, he's your knuckleheaded son.\\
144 - He's my knuckleheaded son now, but when you're trawling for tail...\\
145 - ...at The Home Depot, he's your slow but adorable nephew.\\
146 - I might as well get one perk out of having you sponge off me.\\
147 - - Sponge? Sponge? - Oh, that's a good idea.\\
148 - Well, let me tell you something.\\
149 - Take away your fancy house, your fancy car...\\
150 - ...your women, and what have you got?\\
151 - A better-Iooking version of you.\\
152 - Have I mentioned how much I hate you?\\
153 - Have I mentioned how much I hate you?\\
154 - - Don't copy me. - Don't copy me.\\
155 - - You're an idiot. - You're an idiot.\\
156 - - I'm warning you, Charlie. - I'm warning you, Charlie.\\
157 - How childish.\\
158 - Would you mind toasting my buns, please?\\
159 - To your buns.\\
160 - You sicken me.\\
161 - Hey.\\
162 - - Hey, Rose. - What's going on?\\
163 - Just making lunch.\\
164 - - Wanna join us? - Maybe some other time.\\
165 - A little garlic butter is also a good way to jazz up a hamburger bun.\\
166 - He's lucky all I'm doing is spitting.\\
167 - It doesn't take a master's in behavioral psychology, which I happen to have...\\
168 - ...to see that you and you brother have unresolved fraternal conflicts.\\
169 - Gee, you think?\\
170 - I think it might be therapeutic for you two...\\
171 - ...to sit down with someone and explore those conflicts.\\
172 - - You mean you? - Well, I could refer you...\\
173 - ...to the woman I talk to, but she doesn't exist.\\
174 - So, yeah. Me.\\
175 - Let's see. Couples counseling for me and Alan with you as the therapist.\\
176 - Why don't we just drop acid, run out into the ocean...\\
177 - ...and pretend we're dolphins?\\
178 - You're exhibiting a lot of hostility, Charlie.\\
179 - You know what we psychologists call that?\\
180 - - What? - Hostility.\\
181 - Why would we need more than one word for it?\\
182 - Rose, I appreciate your concern, but Alan and I don't need therapy.\\
183 - Everything will work itself out.\\
184 - I'm just saying, I think it would really help you guys...\\
185 - ...if you could sit down and share your feelings.\\
186 - We're fine, Rose.\\
187 - - Choke on it, princess. - Bite me, bitch.\\
188 - I think he may have anticipated that.\\
189 - - How Freudian. - It's not Freudian.\\
190 - But mine's bigger.\\
191 - It's a banana, you moron.\\
192 - It's not just about you and Charlie, you know.\\
193 - There's that innocent little moppet to consider.\\
194 - Moppet?\\
195 - I'm baking air biscuits. Get them while they're hot.\\
196 - He may not be able to process it now...\\
197 - ...but he picks up on all the negative emotion around here.\\
198 - Save yourselves, run for your lives!\\
199 - Okay, well, if you can get Charlie to agree, I'll do it.\\
200 - - Good. - And as a rule...\\
201 - ...when says they're bad, take his word for it.\\
202 - Oh, please, Alan. I grew up with two older brothers and...\\
203 - Oh, my God!\\
204 - The only reason I let him live here is because of Jake.\\
205 - Go on.\\
206 - He was a pain in the ass when we were kids...\\
207 - ...and now he's blossomed into a three-fingered prostate exam.\\
208 - Have you considered the possibility that since you're the older brother...\\
209 - ...you harbor resentment towards him...\\
210 - ...for usurping Mommy's love and attention?\\
211 - I'm sorry, have you met my mother?\\
212 - Okay, so that's a no.\\
213 - Please don't try to psychoanalyze me.\\
214 - Oh, Charlie. Psychoanalysis takes years.\\
215 - I'm just messing around inside your head.\\
216 - Have you ever considered the possibility...\\
217 - ...that you are the primary male role model in Alan's life?\\
218 - And if his behavior is making you mad, he learned it from you.\\
219 - So, in fact, you are making you mad.\\
220 - That's nuts.\\
221 - Just sit with it for a moment. I think it's a pretty good insight.\\
222 - No, I'm gonna stick with nuts.\\
223 - And I don't wanna continue this.\\
224 - Do you feel you can't be totally honest with me...\\
225 - ...since we slept together? - No.\\
226 - Why can't you be totally honest?\\
227 - - I can be totally honest with you. - Really?\\
228 - How much did you like having sex with me?\\
229 - Let's go talk to Alan.\\
230 - And they wouldn't give me a license.\\
231 - All right. Let the healing begin, you pinhead.\\
232 - Can we refrain from counterproductive name-calling?\\
233 - Such big words from such a little head.\\
234 - Charlie, please sit down.\\
235 - Okay. Here are the ground rules.\\
236 - There will be no name-calling and no interrupting.\\
237 - The purpose of this is to air our feelings without judgment.\\
238 - - Alan, why don't you start? - Why does he start?\\
239 - - Would you like to start? - No.\\
240 - Then shut up.\\
241 - Alan, you'll go first.\\
242 - And begin with the phrase, "I feel Charlie is 'blank.'"\\
243 - I don't think I can top that.\\
244 - Okay, I feel like Charlie is...\\
245 - ...ashamed to have me as a brother.\\
246 - Well, there you go. Are we done?\\
247 - Charlie, you'll get your turn.\\
248 - When was the first time you felt that way, Alan?\\
249 - I guess on the playground.\\
250 - The first day of kindergarten, he told his friends...\\
251 - ...that I was a shaved monkey our mom won in a poker game.\\
252 - Charlie, why do you think you might have said something like that?\\
253 - Well, I guess deep down...\\
254 - ...I always wanted a shaved monkey.\\
255 - You promised Mom you would look after me.\\
256 - I was 7 years old. You can't trust a 7-year-old.\\
257 - You know how he looks after me? He gave me wedgies.\\
258 - From kindergarten on, I got daily wedgies.\\
259 - My butt cheeks didn't unclench until my second year of college.\\
260 - At which point, a long stick slid out.\\
261 - Let's try a little role-playing.\\
262 - He put dog poop in my Mork and Mindy lunchbox.\\
263 - Oh, will you please let that go?\\
264 - And by the way, if you think it through...\\
265 - ...we didn't have a dog. - What?\\
266 - Mom told me to make you lunch, I made you lunch.\\
267 - Oh, my God! Do you see...\\
268 - ...what I have been dealing with my entire life?\\
269 - The real genius was putting it in a hot-dog bun.\\
270 - All through the second grade...\\
271 - ...he would introduce me as his ugly sister, Alana?\\
272 - That's because all through second grade, you wore culottes.\\
273 - They were extra roomy Bermuda shorts. I was prone to chafing.\\
274 - Charlie, how did you feel when you were calling Alan a monkey or a girl...\\
275 - ...or putting excrement in his lunchbox?\\
276 - It's hard to describe.\\
277 - It was kind of a warm, satisfied feeling.\\
278 - And why do you think you felt that way?\\
279 - Because he was such a smartass.\\
280 - Straight A's, Mommy's favorite, Daddy's boy, stepdaddy's boy.\\
281 - Somebody had to take him down a peg.\\
282 - - You were jealous of me. - No, no.\\
283 - - I was annoyed. - I don't believe it.\\
284 - - You were jealous. - No, I wasn't.\\
285 - - Sounds like you were, Charlie. - You can't take sides.\\
286 - - That's unprofessional. - Professional?\\
287 - I'm just making this up as I go along.\\
288 - I'm drawing kitty-cats here.\\
289 - All these years, you had to put me down...\\
290 - ...because you secretly believed that I was better than you.\\
291 - No, that's ridiculous.\\
292 - I knew I was better, but I didn't think you knew.\\
293 - No, no, I didn't know that. There was nothing to know.\\
294 - I don't buy it. You were an emotionally wounded child.\\
295 - I wasn't wounded. I was the wounder.\\
296 - He was the woundee.\\
297 - I was a mean, rotten brother. You've gotta believe me.\\
298 - I tortured him.\\
299 - Once, I convinced him the clothes dryer was a time machine.\\
300 - When he got out, I was dressed in Pilgrim clothes...\\
301 - ...and threatened to burn him as a witch.\\
302 - And now I understand why you did all those things.\\
303 - - And I forgive you. - Don't forgive me.\\
304 - Hate me. Fear me.\\
305 - - Come here. - No.\\
306 - - Come on. Give me a hug. - No, forget it.\\
307 - - Would you rather hug me? - What would be the point of that?\\
308 - It gets me hot.\\
309 - All right, if it'll put an end to all this, one hug.\\
310 - Hey, what are you doing?\\
311 - Let's see how you like a wedgie. Where's your underwear?\\
312 - I'm not wearing any, but thanks for scratching my ass.\\
313 - - This turned out to be a nice weekend. - Yeah. Go figure.\\
314 - Who would've thought Rose would be right?\\
315 - Certainly not Rose.\\
316 - She was right. We had a lot of baggage to clear up.\\
317 - - Yeah, and I'm glad we talked it out. - Me too.\\
318 - You know, when all is said and done, all we have in this world is each other.\\
319 - You, me and that methane cloud you call a son.\\
320 - - It's Mom. - Odds.\\
321 - That's okay. I got this one.\\
322 - - Thank you. - Hey, Mom.\\
323 - Oh, that's Judith.\\
324 - No, I'm just sitting here, enjoying the sunset with my favorite brother.\\
325 - Alan.\\
326 - I'm not lying. I'm not. I'm not.\\
327 - Okay, I am.\\
328 - Jake, your mom's here.\\
329 - - Hey, Judith, how's it going? - I just had a flat tire on the freeway...\\
330 - ...and called AAA, only to find out I no longer have AAA...\\
331 - ...because you no longer pay my dues. - Excuse me, but we're divorced.\\
332 - - You pay that out of your alimony. - No.\\
333 - Because you didn't, I had to stand on the side of the road...\\
334 - ...until a creepy man stopped and offered to change my tire...\\
335 - ...if I'd show him my breasts.\\
336 - Well, there you go. I paid for your breasts.\\
337 - Okay, fine. We'll let our attorneys figure out...\\
338 - ...who pays for roadside service. - No attorneys.\\
339 - - I'm happy to pay for it. - Thank you.\\
340 - - Was that so hard? - No. No, not hard at all.\\
341 - - Bye, Dad. - Bye, buddy.\\
342 - In fact, it was easy.\\
343 - All I had to do was bend over and unclench.\\
344 - Okay, I said it.\\
345 - Mom, you just said I said it.\\
346 - - Have fun at school. - All right.\\
347 - Charlie, wait up.\\
348 - - Did you make Alan's lunch? - Yep.\\
349 - Hey, wait. You forgot to kiss me goodbye.\\
350 - - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did.\\
351 - - I didn't. - Yes, you did.\\
352 - - Okay, I did. - Charlie, wait up.

1 - Jake, use your spoon.\\
2 - Can't. I'll die.\\
3 - If you don't turn off that music, you'll die anyway.\\
4 - Fine.\\
5 - That's better.\\
6 - He's still gonna be living here when he's, like, 30.\\
7 - My big fear is he'll still be in fifth grade.\\
8 - Hello, anybody home? Grandmommy's here.\\
9 - There's my grandson.\\
10 - So, Mom, to what do we owe this unexpected...\\
11 - - Pleasure? - No, that's not it.\\
12 - I was showing a house, and I thought I'd visit the people I love.\\
13 - And they weren't home?\\
14 - Goody. There's a Tudor on Stone Canyon that's going on the market soon.\\
15 - - How do you know? - Owner dropped dead of a heart attack.\\
16 - You know what they say, darling.\\
17 - Today's obituary is tomorrow's exclusive listing.\\
18 - Father of five in Westwood. I'm on fire.\\
19 - You will be soon.\\
20 - Mom, you're not setting a very good example here.\\
21 - Why?\\
22 - Jake, honey, your grandmommy performs a very important public service.\\
23 - When people die, their families are very, very sad...\\
24 - ...and they have no idea what their homes are worth.\\
25 - And you tell them?\\
26 - Oh, you are so cute.\\
27 - And Grandmommy doesn't just prey on the dead, Jake.\\
28 - She also profits from the pain of divorce and the humiliation of bankruptcy.\\
29 - Not to mention she's working on an alternative fuel made from puppies.\\
30 - Oh, my God. Harry Gorsky died.\\
31 - Oh, no. Are you sure it's him?\\
32 - How many Harry Luther Gorskys are there in Los Angeles?\\
33 - - Well, there's one less now. - Who are you talking about?\\
34 - He was Uncle Charlie's and my stepdad.\\
35 - - The first of three, and not my favorite. - I liked him.\\
36 - Oh, please. You were 6. You still liked Mom.\\
37 - - Mom, are you okay? - No, I'm not okay.\\
38 - He was a good man...\\
39 - ...and part of my life, and now he's gone.\\
40 - I just pray he died peacefully...\\
41 - ...and held on to that stately six-bedroom, four-bath Colonial...\\
42 - ...in Hancock Park...\\
43 - ...with the bonus office/guest room over the garage.\\
44 - Let me get this straight.\\
45 - First there was your dad, then this guy Harry who died...\\
46 - ...then the fat guy with the carpet business.\\
47 - No, no, no. The fat guy came after the twitchy gay guy from Texas...\\
48 - ...who gave us crew cuts and called us buckaroos.\\
49 - So out of the three...\\
50 - ...Harry was the best. - I liked the fat guy, remember?\\
51 - With the chubby daughter who was so grateful?\\
52 - All you had to do was knock on her door with some Turkish Taffy.\\
53 - Be that as it may, he was still a very good father to us.\\
54 - Oh, please. He was a little tyrant.\\
55 - "Sit up straight." "Do your homework."\\
56 - "Quit forging my signature on hotel bills."\\
57 - Okay, then. The funeral is tomorrow.\\
58 - I think it would be appropriate for us all to go and pay our respects.\\
59 - I don't know. Tomorrow's not good for me.\\
60 - Oh, Charlie. The man was your father.\\
61 - No, he was not.\\
62 - Why do you care so much? You divorced him.\\
63 - Just because you divorce doesn't mean you no longer have feelings.\\
64 - That's true. Judith still has feelings for me.\\
65 - Pity is not really a feeling, Alan.\\
66 - Regardless of our feelings, we'll still go and say our final goodbyes to Harry.\\
67 - - I'm not going. - Me neither.\\
68 - - Fine, you stay here with Uncle Charlie. - Cool.\\
69 - Yeah, cool. Why do you wanna go?\\
70 - I think it's the right thing to do, and I liked Harry.\\
71 - - And he liked you. - I know.\\
72 - We've stayed in touch over the years.\\
73 - What?\\
74 - You betrayed me by communicating with that son of a bitch after I divorced him?\\
75 - Well, wait a minute. You said that...\\
76 - I know what I said.\\
77 - I was just being polite because the guy's worm chow.\\
78 - All I did was send him Christmas cards and a picture of Jake.\\
79 - - You never send me a picture of Jake. - He's right here.\\
80 - When was the last time I got a Christmas card?\\
81 - Wait, I'm on your side. Charlie's the one who doesn't wanna go.\\
82 - I don't even know if I want you to come now. You've ruined it.\\
83 - - How can you ruin a funeral? - I don't wanna talk about it anymore.\\
84 - - Where are you going? - I need something black.\\
85 - Doesn't your soul qualify?\\
86 - Laugh now, but when I die, I will be coming back to haunt you.\\
87 - How will that be any different than this?\\
88 - Okay, Jake. I'm going to pick up your grandmother.\\
89 - Okay.\\
90 - You think maybe you've played that enough?\\
91 - Okay.\\
92 - I might as well just buy him a crack pipe.\\
93 - Hey!\\
94 - - Let's get this over with. - You're coming to the funeral?\\
95 - I thought about it and realized, even if I didn't like the guy...\\
96 - ...that shouldn't stop me from going to his funeral...\\
97 - ...and, you know, taking a victory lap.\\
98 - Charlie, you're not gonna wanna hear this...\\
99 - ...but you sound a lot like Mom.\\
100 - Tread lightly.\\
101 - - Jake, you're coming with us. - I don't wanna.\\
102 - You get to see a real dead guy.\\
103 - There's gonna be a dead guy? Where?\\
104 - - At the funeral. - Oh, cool. Can I come?\\
105 - Did I say he was gonna live here until 30?\\
106 - I meant forever.\\
107 - What are you talking about?\\
108 - - Go put on your nice clothes. - Okay.\\
109 - He doesn't know what nice clothes are.\\
110 - - Jake? - Oh, right.\\
111 - Isn't it a little early to start drinking?\\
112 - - Would you like a snort? - That's what I meant.\\
113 - Thanks.\\
114 - You okay, Mom?\\
115 - I just can't believe he's gone.\\
116 - Isn't that why we're going to the funeral? To make sure?\\
117 - I'm confused. If you cared for Harry so much, how come you left him?\\
118 - Yes, well, about that.\\
119 - I may have glossed over the details with you boys just a skosh.\\
120 - I didn't actually leave Harry so much as he left me.\\
121 - - You're kidding. - He met a younger woman...\\
122 - ...and just traded me in.\\
123 - You still loved him, didn't you?\\
124 - I loved him very much.\\
125 - Oh, Harry. My sweet, dear Harry.\\
126 - All right. Level eight.\\
127 - So where's the dead guy?\\
128 - Jake, show a little respect.\\
129 - Where's the dead guy, sir?\\
130 - In the chapel. Now keep it down.\\
131 - I think I can smell him.\\
132 - Oh, Lord. There she is.\\
133 - - Who? - The tramp who stole my husband.\\
134 - Not bad.\\
135 - Not good.\\
136 - I'm gonna go mourn.\\
137 - - Yeah, me too. - Stay put. Mommy needs you.\\
138 - - Hello, Evelyn. - Hello, Christine.\\
139 - - This is my son, Alan. - Hello.\\
140 - And who's this little guy? Your grandson?\\
141 - I'm just here to see the dead guy.\\
142 - Yes, I've been blessed with both children and grandchildren.\\
143 - How about you? Oh, wait, I remember.\\
144 - You were slightly less fertile than a sand trap.\\
145 - We're very sorry for your loss.\\
146 - It's not my loss. He left me for that tramp over there.\\
147 - She doesn't look very unhappy, does she?\\
148 - She just met him. Wait a week.\\
149 - I think it's the responsibility of we, the living, to carry on...\\
150 - ...to live life to the fullest. Embrace it.\\
151 - Kiss it on the mouth, if you will.\\
152 - Excuse me, Charlie, can I talk to you for a minute?\\
153 - Sure. Heather, this is my brother, Alan.\\
154 - He lives with me at my beach house in Malibu.\\
155 - - Hi. - I'm sorry for your loss.\\
156 - - Thank you. - Alan came to live with me...\\
157 - ...at my Malibu beach house when he lost his wife.\\
158 - It's a healing house.\\
159 - My wife isn't really dead.\\
160 - Because you healed.\\
161 - At my Malibu beach house.\\
162 - And when you think about it, Harry isn't really dead either.\\
163 - He lives right here...\\
164 - ...in all of us.\\
165 - - Thank you. - Good. Let go.\\
166 - It's good to let go.\\
167 - Charlie.\\
168 - Excuse me a moment.\\
169 - What, what, what, what, what?\\
170 - What do you mean, "What, what, what"?\\
171 - - You're hitting on the widow. - No, I'm consoling the widow.\\
172 - I won't hit on her until they close the lid.\\
173 - Unbelievable. How do you sleep at night?\\
174 - Usually drunk and on top of somebody.\\
175 - But that takes work, Alan. Doesn't just happen by itself.\\
176 - Here's an idea. Why don't you run to the embalming room...\\
177 - ...and see if you can score a couple fresh ones off the truck?\\
178 - Excuse me, but considering your ex-wife...\\
179 - ...I'd say you're the expert on having sex with cold women who don't move.\\
180 - Nevertheless, you can hit on women anywhere.\\
181 - Why did you bother to come?\\
182 - I don't know. I just did.\\
183 - - That's it? No reason? - Do you have a reason for everything?\\
184 - - Yes. - So how's that working out for you?\\
185 - I know how difficult it must be...\\
186 - ...rambling around all by yourself in that big, drafty, six-bedroom Colonial...\\
187 - ...with the guest room/office over the garage.\\
188 - Harry gave me a potbellied pig.\\
189 - So you'd remember him, sure.\\
190 - But I know Harry would want you to move on...\\
191 - ...and this is the perfect time to move on...\\
192 - ...because this is a seller's market. - Excuse me.\\
193 - Can we talk to you a minute?\\
194 - Pardon me, dear.\\
195 - What? I'm working here.\\
196 - That woman just lost her husband.\\
197 - Alan, the man was 50 years old when she was born.\\
198 - - So? - So she had to see it coming.\\
199 - Even for you, that is really cold.\\
200 - Oh, Mr. Graveside Nookie weighs in.\\
201 - You were trying to give the widow a sympathetic crotch to cry on.\\
202 - Hey, watch your mouth. This is a solemn event.\\
203 - Yeah, show a little class.\\
204 - Me? I'm the only one here behaving appropriately.\\
205 - Hey, where's Jake?\\
206 - - Jake. - How do you know my name?\\
207 - - It's okay. - Okay?\\
208 - I almost pooped my pants.\\
209 - What are you doing?\\
210 - I just wanted to see.\\
211 - Okay, well, let's... Let's take a look.\\
212 - - Really? - Yeah. Come on.\\
213 - - What do you think? - I don't know.\\
214 - - How did he die? - He just got old.\\
215 - His heart stopped.\\
216 - His watch is still going.\\
217 - - Yep. - Why would he need a watch, anyway?\\
218 - It's not like he's gonna be late for anything.\\
219 - Okay, there are other people waiting to pay their respects.\\
220 - Why don't we go find Grandma?\\
221 - I don't care what anybody says.\\
222 - I always thought you were a good guy.\\
223 - Thanks, Alan.\\
224 - Want to know what time it is?\\
225 - Let's go.\\
226 - - How's he look? - Dead.\\
227 - Cool.\\
228 - Surprise.\\
229 - Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I've been thinking about it...\\
230 - ...and maybe some of the stuff between us may have been my fault.\\
231 - I was angry about losing my dad, and I guess...\\
232 - ...you were the guy I took it out on.\\
233 - Anyway, not that it makes a lot of difference at this point...\\
234 - ...but I just wanted you to know that I'm sorry.\\
235 - By the way, I'm gonna take a shot at your wife.\\
236 - But that's just a guy thing.\\
237 - Nothing personal, okay?\\
238 - I'll take that as a yes.\\
239 - And so with every door that God closes, he opens a window.\\
240 - Did he say "window" or "widow"?\\
241 - Even as we say goodbye to our beloved friend...\\
242 - ...Harry Luther Gorsky...\\
243 - ...we know that he lives on in all of us.\\
244 - - How are you holding up? - Okay.\\
245 - - lf you need anything, I'm right here. - Thank you. That's very comforting.\\
246 - For everything, there is a season.\\
247 - A time to be born, a time to die.\\
248 - A time to reap, a time to sow.\\
249 - So...\\
250 - ...I would like to invite anyone...\\
251 - ...who wishes to say a few words about Harry...\\
252 - ...to come up and share with us.\\
253 - As always, I'll do him first.\\
254 - - Mom, bad idea. - Hey...\\
255 - ...if I didn't give in to bad ideas, you wouldn't be here. Hold this.\\
256 - Dad. I can't find my Gameboy.\\
257 - Not now, Jake.\\
258 - Hello. Welcome to Harry's funeral.\\
259 - I haven't seen him so drained of bodily fluids since our honeymoon.\\
260 - What? I thought I'd open with a joke.\\
261 - My name is Evelyn Harper...\\
262 - ...or, as dear Harry used to call me, his sweet little sugar tushy.\\
263 - When I first met Harry...\\
264 - ...I was just a hot young widow with bills to pay...\\
265 - ...who could lick the chrome off a trailer hitch.\\
266 - I also had two small boys...\\
267 - ...one of whom Harry cared for very deeply.\\
268 - The other one was Charlie.\\
269 - It wasn't easy being a substitute father...\\
270 - ...but Harry gave it his all.\\
271 - Unfortunately, it wasn't enough...\\
272 - ...which is probably why he looked for solace...\\
273 - ...in the arms of a cheap slut.\\
274 - Stand up, Christine. Let everybody have a look at you.\\
275 - Take a good look, Heather. That's gonna be you someday.\\
276 - Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being disrespectful to the grieving widow.\\
277 - But, listen, you wanna talk grieving? I'm grieving.\\
278 - I loved this man with all my heart, and you left me, you lousy bastard.\\
279 - Well, take a good look. I've still got a great ass...\\
280 - ...and yours is decomposing as we speak.\\
281 - Thank you.\\
282 - - Okay. That was beautiful. - Time to go.\\
283 - I'll call you.\\
284 - - Dad, what about my Gameboy? - Forget it. Just keep walking.\\
285 - And so let's take a moment of silent prayer for our friend, Harry.\\
286 - I am really, really sorry.\\
287 - Got it.\\
288 - It's my kid's. I don't know, maybe I spoil him.\\
289 - Okay, bye.\\
290 - Boys, when I die...\\
291 - ...I want a simple funeral. No tears.\\
292 - - Done. - You got it.\\
293 - And I wanna be buried next to your father.\\
294 - Dad was cremated, Mom.\\
295 - Oh, yes, right.\\
296 - I was thinking of someone else.\\
297 - So I take it you'd rather be buried than cremated?\\
298 - Oh, can't we do both?\\
299 - I want to be buried on the side of a hill...\\
300 - ...nestled amongst the willows, overlooking the ocean.\\
301 - Do we get to pick the ocean?\\
302 - And I want an unadorned headstone, which reads simply:\\
303 - "Evelyn Harper. Loving wife, devoted mother."\\
304 - That's good. Open with a joke.
\subsection {Episode 22: That Old Hose Bag is My Mother}
1 - Charlie? Where's Charlie?\\
2 - Check the living room.\\
3 - - Charlie, guess what? - Somebody call me?\\
4 - Not me.\\
5 - He's not in the living room.\\
6 - - Try his bedroom. - Thanks.\\
7 - Charlie, you gotta see this.\\
8 - Are you sure nobody's calling me?\\
9 - Wouldn't I tell you?\\
10 - Berta, he's not in his room.\\
11 - - What? - I said, he's not in his room.\\
12 - What?\\
13 - - Did you find him? - He's not up there.\\
14 - - Try Jake's room. - What'd he be doing in Jake's room?\\
15 - Hey, I'm just trying to help.\\
16 - I'm sorry. Charlie!\\
17 - I'm sure I heard something.\\
18 - I don't know what to tell you.\\
19 - I could do this all day.\\
20 - Charlie.\\
21 - Hey, Alan.\\
22 - - Didn't you hear me calling you? - Oh, that was you.\\
23 - Of course it was me. Who else would it be?\\
24 - Don't snap at me.\\
25 - I've been running all over looking for you.\\
26 - Well, I was right here.\\
27 - I know that now.\\
28 - Hey, that's no reason to have a hissy fit.\\
29 - Hissy fit? This is not a hissy fit.\\
30 - Say it higher, Alan. A couple of dogs in the neighborhood didn't hear you.\\
31 - I'm all done. I'm going home now.\\
32 - - Thank you. - Good night.\\
33 - Good night, my pets.\\
34 - Now that you've managed to find me, what do you want?\\
35 - There was something I was excited to show you, but now I don't want to.\\
36 - - I'm okay with that. - So am I.\\
37 - Oh, come on. You gotta see this.\\
38 - All right. Fine.\\
39 - Hey. Wait a minute.\\
40 - Did Berta know you were out here?\\
41 - Very mature, Alan. Blame the maid.\\
42 - Oh, you bought a Porsche.\\
43 - "Porsche." What do you think?\\
44 - It's cute.\\
45 - What do you mean, cute?\\
46 - I mean, it looks like my car's hot little girlfriend.\\
47 - Are you saying this is a chick car? Because it isn't. It's a Porsche.\\
48 - Yeah. The cute little one.\\
49 - No, no, no. It's the sporty one.\\
50 - If your sport is girls' basketball.\\
51 - No, no, it's got the fuel injection, and the rack and the pinion...\\
52 - ...and the leather thingy to cover the hood.\\
53 - That's called a bra, Alan.\\
54 - Yeah, but it's made of leather.\\
55 - - All right. Whatever. - It is not a chick car.\\
56 - The salesman showed me brochures with pictures of guys driving it.\\
57 - Alan, if a monkey walked into the dealership...\\
58 - ...he'd have been shown pictures of monkeys driving it.\\
59 - Monkeys can't drive a stick.\\
60 - Now, come on. We'll go for a spin, pick up Jake.\\
61 - Where'd you get the money for this?\\
62 - Where'd you get it...\\
63 - ...because they're not cheap. - No, no, they are not.\\
64 - Where'd you get the money for this?\\
65 - The money. Where'd you get it?\\
66 - Oh, I got it from...\\
67 - - What? - I got a loan from...\\
68 - Alan, where'd the money come from?\\
69 - I found it.\\
70 - - Alan? - Mom.\\
71 - You traded your soul for a Porsche.\\
72 - I didn't trade my soul, and it's "Porsche."\\
73 - Alan, why didn't you come to me?\\
74 - No, I already owe you so much.\\
75 - You won't let me pay rent and you pay all the utilities.\\
76 - Keeping that in mind, did you ever consider...\\
77 - ...taking the money from Mom and paying me back?\\
78 - No, not really.\\
79 - Come on. Let me show you what this baby can do.\\
80 - Well, what do you know? Monkeys can drive a stick.\\
81 - You know, the salesman was right.\\
82 - You really do feel special in one of these things.\\
83 - Oh, yeah. Probably not a lot of middle-aged, divorced guys...\\
84 - ...driving around L.A. in a Porsche.\\
85 - "Porsche."\\
86 - Oh, wait, I forgot to show you the best part.\\
87 - Alan, that's a NASCAR hat.\\
88 - Yeah, they were out of the Porsche hats.\\
89 - I wanted something that said speed and performance, so I got this.\\
90 - What you should be wearing is a hat with a propeller on top.\\
91 - Come on, open her up.\\
92 - The first 1000 miles is the break-in period.\\
93 - You're not supposed to go over 65.\\
94 - Well, then go 65.\\
95 - The speed limit is 60. You want me to get a ticket?\\
96 - Alan, you're driving an expensive red sports car.\\
97 - If you're not getting tickets and tail, you might as well take the bus.\\
98 - Which, by the way, just passed us.\\
99 - I am going plenty fast, thank you very much.\\
100 - Can we at least put the top down?\\
101 - No, I wanna trap the new-car smell in as long as I can.\\
102 - Man, are you anal-retentive.\\
103 - You need a bumper sticker that reads, "My other car is a puckered rectum."\\
104 - Oh, yeah. Like I'd desecrate this car with a bumper sticker.\\
105 - God, I love that sound.\\
106 - Will you stop it?\\
107 - Jake, your dad's here. Where's your car?\\
108 - Oh, my car? My car is...\\
109 - ...right there.\\
110 - - You got a Porsche? - "Porsche."\\
111 - I have to struggle to make ends meet, and you can buy a Porsche?\\
112 - What are you talking about? Your ends have not only met...\\
113 - ...they've been to Hawaii and remodeled the kitchen.\\
114 - Don't change the subject. How can you afford a fancy car?\\
115 - Well, I can't afford it, really.\\
116 - Maybe I have to call my attorney.\\
117 - And re-examine our whole alimony/child-support agreement.\\
118 - No, no, you don't.\\
119 - It wasn't very expensive.\\
120 - This is the girl version. Right, Charlie?\\
121 - Oh, yeah, yeah. You've gotta kiss it before you can even stick the key in.\\
122 - Judith, you have nothing to worry about. You've successfully sucked me dry.\\
123 - Absolutely. This guy's farting dust.\\
124 - Then where'd he get the money for the car?\\
125 - He borrowed it from our mother.\\
126 - Give me a break. Even Alan's not that stupid.\\
127 - Oh, but he is.\\
128 - I am. I swear to God.\\
129 - - Hey, cool car. Is it yours? - Yeah.\\
130 - We're gonna have to talk about my allowance.\\
131 - Okay, well, have a nice weekend.\\
132 - Wait a minute. That's a two-seater. Where's he gonna sit?\\
133 - And you didn't believe he was that stupid.\\
134 - We're going way over the speed limit.\\
135 - Let me worry about that. You just keep looking for cops.\\
136 - I don't usually take a cab.\\
137 - I drive a red Boxster. You know, Porsche.\\
138 - - Those are very nice. - Thank you.\\
139 - My sister has one.\\
140 - - Hey, Berta. You seen my brother? - Did you check his room?\\
141 - Thanks.\\
142 - Sweetie, it is a beautiful car. Congratulations.\\
143 - - Thanks, Mom. I'm really enjoying it. - Well, your Aunt Sylvia loves hers.\\
144 - Berta, have you seen Charlie?\\
145 - Look out on the deck.\\
146 - - I was looking for you. - I was in the garage.\\
147 - - I was looking for you. - I was looking for Alan.\\
148 - I was in the garage.\\
149 - Okay. Bye.\\
150 - Oh, sure. Blame the maid.\\
151 - Oh, Alan, before I forget, I need to ask you for a little favor.\\
152 - Your soul, please.\\
153 - Charlie, for God's sake...\\
154 - Careful. I don't think you're allowed to say "God"...\\
155 - ...without bursting into flames or something.\\
156 - Shush with your antichrist humor.\\
157 - It's getting old.\\
158 - Alan, I'd like you to join me for dinner tomorrow night.\\
159 - - Why? - I'm dating a man I'd like you to meet.\\
160 - And?\\
161 - He has a lovely daughter about your age.\\
162 - Sayeth the serpent.\\
163 - No. Mom, please, please, please, no blind dates.\\
164 - Why not? She's a sweet girl and I think you might really hit it off.\\
165 - - Why can't Charlie go out with her? - Hey, she didn't buy me a car.\\
166 - This has absolutely nothing to do with the car.\\
167 - Besides, I want to get closer to this man.\\
168 - Should the time come when I want an ugly breakup...\\
169 - ...I'll let you take a crack at his daughter.\\
170 - I'm sorry, Mom. But I'd rather not.\\
171 - Alan, I bought you a car.\\
172 - I love the smell of brimstone in the morning.\\
173 - Tomorrow night, 8:00, Le Pissoir.\\
174 - - I really appreciate this, darling. - Sure.\\
175 - Oh, one more thing. She's been through a rough patch lately...\\
176 - ...so we won't be ordering alcohol.\\
177 - Bye-bye.\\
178 - No, really. She sounds great.\\
179 - Looks like my mom and your dad are running a little late.\\
180 - Typical.\\
181 - Yeah. So you're in town for the weekend. Where do you live?\\
182 - Palm Springs.\\
183 - That's nice. How long have you lived there?\\
184 - Forty-two days, so far.\\
185 - Forty-two days?\\
186 - Yeah. This is my first weekend pass.\\
187 - I was supposed to get one at 30, but I bit a guy.\\
188 - - Would you like a cocktail? - No, no, no cocktails. No.\\
189 - - No, that's all right. You can have one. - No, I'm fine.\\
190 - - Oh, please. Go ahead. - No. I don't think...\\
191 - Order a drink, damn it. I wanna smell it.\\
192 - We're fine. Maybe just a fizzy water.\\
193 - So, what do you do?\\
194 - I'm a chiropractor.\\
195 - Really? Can you prescribe stuff?\\
196 - No.\\
197 - Did you hear that?\\
198 - - It's my phone. - Oh, thank God.\\
199 - Hello? Oh, hey, Mom. Where are you?\\
200 - Yes, she's here.\\
201 - Yes, very sweet. Where are you?\\
202 - Trudy, Trudy, there's no smoking.\\
203 - Oh, that's just great. Just jim-freaking-dandy.\\
204 - You guys are coming, right? Well, what am I supposed to do?\\
205 - Yes, I know you bought me a car.\\
206 - All right, all right. All right. Goodbye.\\
207 - Apparently, your father mixed up his heart pills with his Viagra...\\
208 - ...and they didn't wanna waste the opportunity.\\
209 - So he's not coming?\\
210 - Well...\\
211 - Perfect. Just perfect.\\
212 - That son of a bitch never cared about me.\\
213 - Trudy, Trudy...\\
214 - He'd rather spend the night with some old hose bag.\\
215 - That old hose bag is my mother...\\
216 - ...and there's still no smoking in here. I'm sorry.\\
217 - Careful. I bit the last guy who tried to touch me.\\
218 - Yeah, well, that doesn't mean we can't have a nice meal.\\
219 - I'll call the waiter.\\
220 - Hello, hello. Yeah, we're ready to order.\\
221 - Remind me to get some clean urine from you before we go.\\
222 - - Two hundred forty pounds... - What are you doing?\\
223 - Picking off the pepperonis.\\
224 - Then why'd you order it with pepperonis?\\
225 - I like to stack them up and eat them in bed.\\
226 - Hello? Hey, Mom.\\
227 - No, Dad's not here. He's on a date.\\
228 - Hang on. Uncle Charlie's talking to me. Yeah?\\
229 - Don't tell your mom your father's on a date.\\
230 - - It's none of her business. - Okay.\\
231 - He's not on a date.\\
232 - Hang on. She wants to talk to you.\\
233 - Uncle Charlie's not here.\\
234 - Give me that.\\
235 - Hey, Judith. What's up?\\
236 - Well, he's not a bright kid. What do you want from me?\\
237 - I don't know where Alan is.\\
238 - Would you like me to give him a message?\\
239 - Because who knows? Maybe this time I will.\\
240 - No message.\\
241 - How come it's a secret Dad's on a date?\\
242 - It's not. It's just never a good idea to tell women more than they need to know.\\
243 - How come?\\
244 - Because we love them and want to protect them.\\
245 - A clueless woman is a happy woman.\\
246 - - Can I have your pepperonis? - No.\\
247 - Batman!\\
248 - Come on. Come on, Trudy. Come on. Come on.\\
249 - - Let's get you back to the Batcave... - Oh, right.\\
250 - ...or whatever cave you crawled out of.\\
251 - Thank you, kind sir. You are indeed a gentleman.\\
252 - Allow me to reward you.\\
253 - A salty! I shall now need a slice of lime and a carafe of tequila.\\
254 - No, thank you. No, no, we're fine.\\
255 - Hey, come on, Trudy. Let's take you home.\\
256 - Okay. But we'll have to be really quiet...\\
257 - ...because my roommate is detoxing, so she's kind of a light sleeper.\\
258 - No, no, I meant home to your father.\\
259 - Oh, God.\\
260 - Daddy!\\
261 - Oh, I'm such a disappointment to you.\\
262 - Hey, your aftershave has alcohol in it.\\
263 - So why is Dad's car a chick car?\\
264 - It's not really. I was just saying that to bust his chops.\\
265 - Chops are your nuts, right?\\
266 - Right.\\
267 - Mom said it's a midlife-crisis car.\\
268 - Well, she was bound to be right about something eventually.\\
269 - What's a midlife crisis?\\
270 - Well, Jake, it's when a man starts facing his own mortality...\\
271 - ...and tries to recapture his youth.\\
272 - I've had one of those.\\
273 - Do tell.\\
274 - Life was so much simpler when I was 6.\\
275 - Hello? Hey, Dad.\\
276 - Listen, don't worry about your midlife crisis.\\
277 - They usually go away over summer vacation.\\
278 - He wants to talk to you. Are you here?\\
279 - Yeah. Whoa, slow down.\\
280 - Well, how drunk is she?\\
281 - Really? Batman drunk?\\
282 - Well, just dump her with Mom and her father.\\
283 - Where are they?\\
284 - Viagra and a bad ticker.\\
285 - Mom loses more boyfriends that way.\\
286 - Alan, calm down, calm down. Listen to me. Here's what you do:\\
287 - Take her to a club...\\
288 - ...pin a warning note on her back as a courtesy to the next guy...\\
289 - ...and run like hell.\\
290 - Well, if you don't want my advice, why'd you call me?\\
291 - Okay, how about this:\\
292 - Put the top down and let the night air sober her up.\\
293 - What's plan B?\\
294 - How come you don't have a date tonight?\\
295 - I decided I'd rather hang out with you.\\
296 - - Really? - No.\\
297 - You're saying that to bust my chops.\\
298 - No.\\
299 - - Hey. - Hey.\\
300 - - How was your date? - Oh, lots of fun.\\
301 - - Think you'll marry her? - Doubtful. Charlie?\\
302 - What happened? You take her to a club and ditch her?\\
303 - - No, I couldn't do that. - Why not?\\
304 - Well, it's cheesy and immoral...\\
305 - ...and I'm really not comfortable having some valet touch my car.\\
306 - - So where is she? - In the garage.\\
307 - - Oh, Alan. - Well, she passed out.\\
308 - - I figured I'd let her sleep it off. - You left her in your car?\\
309 - Why not?\\
310 - Well, at least she left the garage door open.\\
311 - It's a red Porsche Boxster with dealer plates.\\
312 - "Porsche." Yeah, about an hour ago.\\
313 - Hey, Dad, check it out. Your car's on TV.\\
314 - I'll call you back.\\
315 - - chase so far. The suspect was first spotted in Malibu...\\
316 - ... on the Pacific Coast Highway...\\
317 - ... and is now southbound on the 405 freeway.\\
318 - Oh, God!\\
319 - Don't worry. I've watched hundreds of these. They never make it.\\
320 - - she just ran over the nail strips that the Highway Patrol laid out.\\
321 - Oh, man, look at the sparks.\\
322 - That's because she's riding on rims, Jake.\\
323 - You gotta like how your car handles without tires.\\
324 - Oh, God!\\
325 - Whoa, that was a close call.\\
326 - She sideswiped that SUV and kept right on going.\\
327 - What's that dragging alongside Dad's car?\\
328 - I think that's the door.\\
329 - - Cool. - Oh, God!\\
330 - Dale, this is Trish in the studio. Can you see the suspect?\\
331 - How do you know it's a woman?\\
332 - Well, Trish, we actually don 't know it's a woman...\\
333 - ... but thought it was a safe bet based on the type of car.\\
334 - It's not a chick car.\\
335 - Relax, Dad. He's just busting your chops.
\subsection {Episode 23: Squab, Squab, Squab, Squab, Squab}
1 - Hey, Jake, why don't you tell Grandma about your spring break.\\
2 - - Bad idea. - What?\\
3 - Nothing. I just saw that they're moving the L.A. Gardening Exposition...\\
4 - ...to the Convention Center, which I think is a very bad idea.\\
5 - Thanks for the update. Go ahead, Jake, tell Grandma.\\
6 - - It was really cool, l... - Hang on a second, Jake.\\
7 - I'm not sure you understand how serious this gardening thing is.\\
8 - It's a really bad idea.\\
9 - I get it. Bad idea.\\
10 - Go ahead, Jake.\\
11 - I went camping with Grandma and Grandpa.\\
12 - We slept in a tent, we cooked on an open fire.\\
13 - And we went hiking and saw a bear.\\
14 - You let him spend an entire vacation with his other grandparents...\\
15 - ...and I haven't had him for a night?\\
16 - Oh, bad idea.\\
17 - This is unfair and unacceptable.\\
18 - From the moment that boy was born...\\
19 - ...Judith's parents squeezed me out. And you let them.\\
20 - Interesting point.\\
21 - Excuse me, Mom, but when Jake was born...\\
22 - ...Judith's mother stayed with us, cooking and cleaning...\\
23 - ...and taking care of him. - Valid counterpoint.\\
24 - Exactly. She's a pushy, pushy woman.\\
25 - Personal opinion.\\
26 - No, no. You went on a cruise.\\
27 - But Judith was two days late.\\
28 - And I had nonrefundable reservations.\\
29 - Like it would have killed her to get a C-section.\\
30 - Self-obsessed psychotic rant.\\
31 - - Mom, are you listening to yourself? - Stupid question.\\
32 - Awkward silence.\\
33 - You wanna spend more time with your grandson, he's right here.\\
34 - No. He goes to visit his other grandparents.\\
35 - He should come to visit me.\\
36 - - So you wanna spend a week with him? - A week?\\
37 - Alan, I do have a life.\\
38 - I'm confused. What exactly do you want?\\
39 - The same quality time Jake spends with his other grandparents.\\
40 - But, you know, less.\\
41 - I'll tell you what. Bring him to my place around 6-ish tonight.\\
42 - I'll make him dinner, we'll have a fun sleepover.\\
43 - - Gee, Mom, I don't know. - Well, why not?\\
44 - Are you afraid one night with me will irreparably damage him?\\
45 - - Yeah. - A little.\\
46 - Excuse me. I didn't hear any complaints when I was raising you two.\\
47 - The teenage drinking and constant running away wasn't a slight tip-off?\\
48 - Oh, you were just a little drama queen, Charlie.\\
49 - And let's not forget, you always came back.\\
50 - Kind of hard to find steady work when you're 9.\\
51 - Whatever. My place, 6-ish.\\
52 - Judith! I can't just leave him with you without discussing it with his mother.\\
53 - Are you telling me you need to get your ex-wife's approval...\\
54 - ...to let your own son spend time with your own mother?\\
55 - He had a really bad lawyer.\\
56 - You know what your problem is, Alan. You let women walk all over you.\\
57 - You get that from your father.\\
58 - Well, nevertheless, I still have to clear it with Judith.\\
59 - - Well, fine, call her. - Right now?\\
60 - Well, why not? Unless you'd rather I make the call.\\
61 - Probably not home. I'll just... I'll leave a message.\\
62 - Yeah. Hi, Judith.\\
63 - Listen, it's Alan. Call me back when you get a chance.\\
64 - Hello? Oh, hi, Judith, you old call-screener, you.\\
65 - Listen, I just wanted to run something past you.\\
66 - Jake was telling my mom about the fun time he had with your parents...\\
67 - ...and she thought that...\\
68 - What do you mean, "no"? I haven't even asked yet.\\
69 - Oh, really? Well, I've got news for you, lady.\\
70 - You can't say no, she's his grandmother.\\
71 - Well, she may be that too...\\
72 - ...but she's still his grandmother and this is my weekend with him.\\
73 - Charlie and I turned out fine.\\
74 - We did too.\\
75 - Look, he's going, and that's that.\\
76 - All right then, goodbye.\\
77 - - It's settled. He'll be there at 6. - Thank you.\\
78 - Of course, it is rather short notice.\\
79 - - Mom! - Okay. Fine.\\
80 - But don't get used to this.\\
81 - I'm not your full-time babysitter.\\
82 - I played that wrong, didn't I?\\
83 - No, no. You called mom's bluff and you stood up to your ex-wife.\\
84 - You maintained your self-respect, I'm proud of you.\\
85 - - Yeah, but what about Jake? - Oh, Jake.\\
86 - Jake's screwed.\\
87 - This has been the greatest day of my life. Movies, laser tag, video arcade.\\
88 - Well, that's good. I wanted today to be special.\\
89 - - How come? - Just because I love you.\\
90 - I love you too, Dad.\\
91 - You know how people say you can't buy love?\\
92 - I think they're wrong.\\
93 - You hold on to that sentiment.\\
94 - What's the plan for tonight? Is it gonna be special too?\\
95 - Oh, God, I can't watch this.\\
96 - - What? - Nothing.\\
97 - Oh, hey, here's $20.\\
98 - Wow, thanks.\\
99 - - You're spending tonight at Grandma's. - Great. Wait, what?\\
100 - You're gonna have lots of fun.\\
101 - - Right, Charlie? - This is the first I'm hearing of it.\\
102 - I don't want to go to Grandma's. Here, take your money.\\
103 - Come on, buddy. She loves you very much.\\
104 - And it's just for one night.\\
105 - But we were having so much fun.\\
106 - Think it through, Jake. Why were you having so much fun?\\
107 - - You tricked me. - Attaboy.\\
108 - What did I ever do to you?\\
109 - It's not a punishment.\\
110 - It's not a prize.\\
111 - - I'm calling Mom. - No. No, no calling Mom.\\
112 - I know my rights. I get one phone call.\\
113 - - I've already told your mother. - She agreed?\\
114 - She knows about it.\\
115 - Uncle Charlie, can you get me out of this?\\
116 - It depends. Are you willing to live in Mexico for a few years?\\
117 - Jake, please. Do it as a favor to your grandmother, who loves you.\\
118 - For me. For Uncle Charlie.\\
119 - But most of all, for me.\\
120 - What do I get?\\
121 - What do you mean? I spent a fortune on you today.\\
122 - That was because you love me. Now you need me.\\
123 - Oh, God, this is a great kid.\\
124 - Okay. What do you want?\\
125 - A motorized Razor scooter, the new Dragon Ball Z game...\\
126 - ...an iPod mini and not to go to Grandma's.\\
127 - - I'll give you three out of four. - Okay.\\
128 - Forget the iPod.\\
129 - - This is the worst day of my life. - Come on.\\
130 - You're gonna eat your dinner, watch some videos, play some games...\\
131 - ...and you're gonna go to bed and we'll pick you up tomorrow. Promise.\\
132 - Your word means nothing to me.\\
133 - Hey, give your dad a break. So he lied.\\
134 - You don't get the virgin to the volcano by telling her you're gonna push her in.\\
135 - - Can't we just go home? - No. Now, enough of this.\\
136 - - I am the adult and you are the child. - And this is the volcano.\\
137 - Now, you're gonna go in there and you're gonna have a nice evening.\\
138 - - Do we understand each other? - Yes.\\
139 - Thank you. Now, ring the bell.\\
140 - So exactly what time are you...? Hey!\\
141 - We've done a terrible thing.\\
142 - Yeah. If only there was a magical liquid that could erase bad memories.\\
143 - I am absolutely racked with guilt.\\
144 - Alan, don't beat yourself up.\\
145 - You're a good dad who, in a moment of weakness, betrayed his only son.\\
146 - Come on, he's not in any real danger.\\
147 - Not physically, but you know as well I do...\\
148 - ...that Mom has the ability to say things that stick with you.\\
149 - Yeah, forever and ever.\\
150 - My favorite was, " They must have mixed you up with another baby...\\
151 - ...because I could never have given birth to such a hateful child."\\
152 - Who writes that on a fifth-grader's birthday card?\\
153 - How about, " It's no wonder your father stays at work.\\
154 - If I could get out of here, I would too."\\
155 - Did I ever tell you about the time I wrote my first jingle?\\
156 - Pepsi. I invited Mom over to watch the prime-time network debut.\\
157 - For 30 seconds, 20 million people were listening to my music.\\
158 - And at the end, Mom turned to me and said:\\
159 - "You couldn't get Coke to hire you?"\\
160 - - Nice. But I can top it. - Go.\\
161 - It's the day of my wedding. She's sitting there crying.\\
162 - And I think it's because she's happy.\\
163 - Turns out it was because she was, and I quote:\\
164 - "So relieved you finally found someone who could love you."\\
165 - - We gotta go get Jake. - You're right. Come on.\\
166 - Great game, ladies.\\
167 - - He'll be fine. - Who?\\
168 - - Jake. - Oh, yeah. He'll be fine.\\
169 - - Who? - Jake.\\
170 - He'll be fine.\\
171 - I thought we'd eat Japanese-style.\\
172 - Good Lord, are you picking your nose?\\
173 - I had to. There was stuff in it.\\
174 - And where were you planning to put it?\\
175 - I really didn't have a plan.\\
176 - Don't you dare wipe that on my furniture.\\
177 - And not on your clothes either.\\
178 - - What are you doing now? - Putting it back.\\
179 - Here, just wipe your hands.\\
180 - - Why? - Because we're going to eat dinner.\\
181 - And you've been rooting around in your nostril.\\
182 - It's okay. I don't eat with my hands. I use a fork.\\
183 - - Wipe your hands. - Okay.\\
184 - Thank you.\\
185 - Has your mother or father ever taken you out for sushi?\\
186 - No. I don't like raw fish.\\
187 - - Well, have you ever had it? - No.\\
188 - How do you know you don't like it?\\
189 - It's an educated guess.\\
190 - Well, why don't you just try it.\\
191 - Let's start with the tuna, shall we? There you go.\\
192 - That's not tuna.\\
193 - Oh, yes, it is.\\
194 - I've had tuna.\\
195 - Jake, it's tuna.\\
196 - Now, why don't you just take a little bite. Here.\\
197 - Dip it in the soy sauce first.\\
198 - There you go. Have a bite.\\
199 - You know, there's a girl at school, Elizabeth Kurzner...\\
200 - ...and her mom ate a bunch of sushi, and it had worms.\\
201 - And they grew in her and crawled out of her eyes.\\
202 - - Oh, no, they didn't. - How do you know?\\
203 - - Just take a little bite. - Okay.\\
204 - - Jake! - It's gross. It tastes like worms.\\
205 - Jake, stop spitting on my rug.\\
206 - - Where do you want me to spit? - Don't spit at all.\\
207 - - I gotta get the taste out. - Have some ginger.\\
208 - - No, Jake, that's wasabi. - What?\\
209 - Are you trying to kill me?\\
210 - No, Jake, don't. That's an expensive pillow.\\
211 - Let... Give me that!\\
212 - Okay, here.\\
213 - I've just gotta ask.\\
214 - Playing volleyball on the beach every day, don't you worry about melanoma?\\
215 - Alan, walk with me.\\
216 - Be right back.\\
217 - - What? - Listen closely:\\
218 - No man has ever gotten into a woman's pants chitchatting about skin cancer.\\
219 - You can't possibly know that.\\
220 - Nevertheless.\\
221 - Let's steer the conversation away from tumors, okay?\\
222 - - Okay. So which one do you like? - One?\\
223 - God, in his infinite wisdom, has given us a big box of assorted chocolates...\\
224 - ...and you're just gonna try one?\\
225 - So are you thinking, like, two?\\
226 - I was thinking, like, nine.\\
227 - - But we'll see what happens. - You're not serious.\\
228 - His will be done.\\
229 - What else do we have to eat?\\
230 - You mean other than the $50 worth of sushi in my carpet?\\
231 - Yeah.\\
232 - - I don't suppose you'd eat squab. - No.\\
233 - - Do you even know what it is? - No.\\
234 - But it sounds pretty creepy. "Squab."\\
235 - Well, what would you eat?\\
236 - Pretty much anything, except sushi and squab.\\
237 - Squab, squab.\\
238 - Squab, squab, squab, squab, squab, squab...\\
239 - - Stop it. - Sorry.\\
240 - Squab.\\
241 - Would you eat spaghetti?\\
242 - - I love spaghetti. - Great.\\
243 - Would you prefer vermicelli or linguine?\\
244 - Spaghetti.\\
245 - All right. What would you like on it?\\
246 - Puttanesca, Bolognese, Milanese, olive oil with truffles?\\
247 - How about squab?\\
248 - I'm just kidding. Ketchup.\\
249 - - Of course. - And sliced-up hot dogs.\\
250 - Unbelievable. My grandson is a hillbilly.\\
251 - You know, I'm thinking we should move this party over to my place.\\
252 - But we've been playing volleyball all day.\\
253 - We're all sweaty and sticky.\\
254 - No problem. Mi shower es su shower.\\
255 - - What? - I have a shower.\\
256 - - Good. You live alone? - Pretty much.\\
257 - My brother stays with me and he's got a kid, but he's at his grandmother's.\\
258 - Oh, that is so sweet.\\
259 - Yeah, well, we're sweet people.\\
260 - I was raised by my grandma. I called her Nana.\\
261 - - Is that so? - Yeah.\\
262 - I was raised by my grandma. I called her Nana.\\
263 - Oh, yeah. She was a big influence on me.\\
264 - She raised me. I called her Nana.\\
265 - Oh, Jake, what have we done to you?\\
266 - Dinner, such as it is, is served.\\
267 - Jake? Where are you? Come into the dining room!\\
268 - Squab!\\
269 - Alan. Alan, I'm worried about the kid.\\
270 - What kid?\\
271 - Your kid. Our kid. I think we should go to Mom's and get him.\\
272 - Oh, come on, he's fine. And it's just for one night.\\
273 - Which, by the way, is rapidly becoming one of the best nights of my life.\\
274 - And grind, and grind. And step and step and turn.\\
275 - Alan. Alan, please.\\
276 - Hey, if you're worried, why don't you call.\\
277 - And grind, and grind. And grind and grind and grind.\\
278 - - What's her number? - You don't have her on speed dial?\\
279 - Hey, if I can't eat it, bang it or bet on it, it's not in my phone.\\
280 - It's ringing.\\
281 - And grind, and grind. And I'm a lucky boy.\\
282 - Hello? Mom?\\
283 - I can't talk to you now, Charlie.\\
284 - Get that out of your mouth. Are you an animal?\\
285 - Mom? Hello? Hello?\\
286 - And grind, and grind. And step and step and...\\
287 - You don't understand, Charlie.\\
288 - It was a women's volleyball team and I could've been the volleyball.\\
289 - - Get your priorities straight, will you? - I've got my priorities straight.\\
290 - I've had a kid for 11 years, but I've never had group sex.\\
291 - Alan, you didn't miss anything. It's an overrated male fantasy.\\
292 - - Really? - No, are you kidding?\\
293 - He'd better be scarred for life.\\
294 - - Mom? - Oh, hello, boys.\\
295 - What happened? Where's Jake?\\
296 - I sent him up to take a bath.\\
297 - He had hot dogs and spaghetti in his hair.\\
298 - Why would he have hot dogs and spaghetti in his hair?\\
299 - Because he wouldn't eat squab.\\
300 - Squab.\\
301 - - What are you guys doing here? - We wanted to see how things were.\\
302 - - They're okay. - See, he's fine.\\
303 - - Let's go back to the bar. - And take me with you.\\
304 - - Jake? - Yeah?\\
305 - Did you turn the water off in the bathtub?\\
306 - - Say goodbye to Grandma. - Goodbye, Grandma.\\
307 - Night, Mom.\\
308 - You realize that in one night, he did what we couldn't do in a lifetime.\\
309 - He broke her.\\
310 - He chewed her up and spit her out.\\
311 - It was a beautiful thing.\\
312 - I'm gonna be truthful here, Alan.\\
313 - I always thought your kid was a little bit of a simpleton.\\
314 - Me too.\\
315 - But clearly, he is the chosen one.\\
316 - Hey, guys, check it out.\\
317 - Pull my finger.\\
318 - Okay.\\
319 - And they shall call him Jake.
\subsection {Episode 24: Does This Smell Funny to You}
1 - That was very nice, Mindy.\\
2 - Okay.\\
3 - Jake, we're ready to hear your report.\\
4 - - Jake? - Just a sec.\\
5 - Now, Jake.\\
6 - Okay, I'm finished.\\
7 - - Does spelling and grammar count? - It's an oral report, Jake.\\
8 - Oh, so it's like an oral thermometer.\\
9 - Right.\\
10 - Good thing it's not a rectal report.\\
11 - - Just read it. - Okay.\\
12 - "My Weekend, by Jake Harper.\\
13 - Grade five, Mrs. Flanigan's class.\\
14 - Woodward Avenue Elementary School, located on Woodward Avenue."\\
15 - I'm not counting words.\\
16 - Oh, good.\\
17 - "My weekend starts on Friday, when my mom takes me to my dad's house.\\
18 - Which is actually my Uncle Charlie's house.\\
19 - Who is my dad's brother, making him my uncle.\\
20 - His name is Charlie, which is why I call him my Uncle Charlie."\\
21 - Anyway...\\
22 - "Even though my parents are divorced, they still get along. "\\

24 - - How was your week? - Just fine.\\
25 - - Bye, honey. - Bye, Mom.\\
26 - - Thanks for bringing him. - Bite me. What the hell...\\
27 - ...went on last weekend? - What are you talking about?\\
28 - When I brought him home Sunday night and served him dinner...\\
29 - ...he tipped me with a $25 chip from Caesars Palace...\\
30 - ...and told me I had a nice rack.\\
31 - Well, Judith...\\
32 - ...you do.\\
33 - That's not the point.\\
34 - Where'd he get the chip? Where is he learning this behavior?\\
35 - Hey, Judith.\\
36 - Looking good.\\
37 - Run away, run away.\\
38 - Did you give my son a $25 chip?\\
39 - - No, I did not give him a $25 chip. - Happy?\\
40 - He won it, fair and square.\\
41 - You couldn't run away.\\
42 - I don't care what you do on weekdays.\\
43 - But on weekends, remember you are a role model for an 11 -year-old boy.\\
44 - Oh, that's a bad idea. Who thought of that?\\
45 - I'm warning you. Things had better change or there will be consequences.\\
46 - Legal consequences. Got it?\\
47 - - Got it. - Goodbye.\\
48 - "There will be serious consequences.\\
49 - Legal consequences."\\
50 - "I don't care what you do during the week.\\
51 - But on the weekends, you're a role model."\\
52 - I enjoy talking this way.\\
53 - As do I.\\
54 - "Friday night, I stayed up late.\\
55 - I watched all three Austin Power movies with my dad.\\
56 - We ate Chinese food and Buffalo wings.\\
57 - Dad fell asleep during The Spy Who Shagged Me...\\
58 - ...which, in my opinion, is the strongest of the trilogy.\\
59 - By the way, 'shag' means 'sex' in England."\\
60 - Just read, Jake.\\
61 - That was a footnote.\\
62 - - Read. - Okay.\\
63 - "I woke up later with a stomachache...\\
64 - ...but felt better after I went to the bathroom."\\
65 - If you know what I mean.\\
66 - - Jake. - What? It's not like I said:\\
67 - "I took a dump."\\
68 - "Anyway, I tried to go back to sleep but I couldn 't.\\
69 - Probably because I was thirsty.\\
70 - So I went into the kitchen for what Uncle Charlie calls a 'virgin screwdriver. '\\
71 - But really it's just a glass of orange juice.\\
72 - It was late, so I decided to skip the glass. "\\
73 - Jake?\\
74 - Hang on.\\
75 - That one hurt a little.\\
76 - - What you doing? - Having a virgin screwdriver.\\
77 - - Want some? - No, thanks. I'm good.\\
78 - - What are you doing? - Watching TV.\\
79 - Why isn't it on?\\
80 - Because I've seen this one already.\\
81 - - Hey, you wanna hear a funny joke? - Sure.\\
82 - Why did the blond stare at the juice carton?\\
83 - I don't know. Why?\\
84 - "Cause the carton said 'concentrate.'"\\
85 - That's okay. I didn't get it either.\\
86 - "The next morning I was pretty hungry because..."\\
87 - I think you all know why.\\
88 - "So I had a bowl of cereal with my dad, and we made plans for the day. "\\
89 - - You wanna go to the museum? - No. I wanna watch TV.\\
90 - It's pretty windy out there. Wanna fly a kite?\\
91 - No. I wanna watch TV.\\
92 - - Hiking? - TV.\\
93 - - I'll get it. - TV.\\
94 - "We decided to watch TV."\\
95 - - Hello. - Is your name Harper?\\
96 - - Yes. - Then this is for you.\\
97 - - Why'd you do that? - Why did you sleep with my wife?\\
98 - Charlie.\\
99 - Busy.\\
100 - I don't care. Open the door.\\
101 - - I've got company. - I know.\\
102 - And her husband's downstairs.\\
103 - Really?\\
104 - - You're married? - Yeah.\\
105 - I'm not in.\\
106 - You have to come and deal with him.\\
107 - - No, I don't. - Yes, you do.\\
108 - I disagree.\\
109 - It's not up for debate. He knows you're here.\\
110 - Oh, man, I hate when this happens.\\
111 - This happens a lot?\\
112 - Not a lot, but enough to be a drag.\\
113 - Charlie, are you coming back to bed?\\
114 - - Yes. - Yes? No "yes."\\
115 - There is an angry husband in your living room.\\
116 - How angry?\\
117 - - Is he packing? - What?\\
118 - - Does he have a weapon? - l... He has a stick.\\
119 - That's not good. I could lose an eye.\\
120 - - Charlie! Come on. - Fine, I'll wrap it up here.\\
121 - - Give me 20 minutes. - Oh, no.\\
122 - A better idea. Wrap it up now.\\
123 - - Ten minutes? - Now.\\
124 - We got five minutes.\\
125 - "The weekend was going great, but then something really bad happened. "\\
126 - - Hey. - Hello.\\
127 - - Who are you? - I'm Norman.\\
128 - I'm Jake. Have you seen my Game Boy?\\
129 - No. Have you seen my wife?\\
130 - No. Well, if you see it, let me know.\\
131 - Ditto.\\
132 - "I couldn 't believe it.\\
133 - I lost my Game Boy."\\
134 - "I couldn't find my Game Boy in the kitchen or living room...\\
135 - ...so I checked my bedroom and my bathroom.\\
136 - Because, as you may recall, I'd spent a lot of time in there the night before."\\
137 - - He'll be right down. - Thank you.\\
138 - Can I get you a cup of coffee?\\
139 - Decaf. I'm already pretty enraged.\\
140 - Well, that's certainly understandable.\\
141 - I have cookies too.\\
142 - - I wouldn't say no to a cookie. - Good. Come on in the kitchen.\\
143 - I always find a nice cookie can brighten up even the darkest day.\\
144 - Yeah, well, this better be one hell of a cookie.\\
145 - - It's a nice house you got here. - Oh, thank you.\\
146 - Actually, it belongs to my...\\
147 - You live in the neighborhood?\\
148 - - Bel-Air. - Oh, that's nice too.\\
149 - Gated community, but the wife gets out anyway.\\
150 - Chews through her leash, huh?\\
151 - Hey, let me get you that cookie.\\
152 - You see like a nice fella. I'm sorry I hit you with my stick.\\
153 - Oh, that's okay. I'm sorry my brother is...\\
154 - That's okay.\\
155 - So women, huh?\\
156 - Can't live with them.\\
157 - That's all I got.\\
158 - - You married? - Divorced.\\
159 - - She sleep around? - No, mostly just slept.\\
160 - You're lucky.\\
161 - There's no pain greater than being betrayed by the woman you love.\\
162 - You know, these are really very tasty.\\
163 - Aren't they?\\
164 - - Good morning. - Oh, speaking of tasty cookies...\\
165 - ...Norman, this is Berta.\\
166 - - Hello. - What is this, a fix-up?\\
167 - No, no. Nothing like that.\\
168 - That's good, because I'd probably kill him.\\
169 - Nothing personal, Cotton Top. I just kind of like it rough.\\
170 - - Have another cookie. - Thank you.\\
171 - So is anybody gonna tell me what's going on?\\
172 - Well, it's a little complicated.\\
173 - - Charlie... - Got it.\\
174 - Got it? How could you get it?\\
175 - There's a Rolls-Royce in the driveway...\\
176 - ...and I found these hanging on the mailbox...\\
177 - ...so I'm guessing that your brother's got some bimbo upstairs...\\
178 - ...and Norman here is her daddy or her sugar daddy.\\
179 - - Tell me I'm wrong. - I'm the husband.\\
180 - Judges?\\
181 - - You gotta give it to her. - Yes.\\
182 - - I mean, tough break. - Thank you.\\
183 - - You got a gun? - No!\\
184 - - Want one? - Berta!\\
185 - I'm making small talk.\\
186 - Okay.\\
187 - You wanna talk this out like gentlemen, or you...?\\
188 - You might've mentioned he fought at the Alamo.\\
189 - - No offense. - None taken.\\
190 - - Does that make us even? - You tell me.\\
191 - Okay. One more.\\
192 - How about that?\\
193 - - He poked you, you poked his... - Berta!\\
194 - What? How often do you see that kind of symmetry in life?\\
195 - Hey.\\
196 - Hello.\\
197 - Were you just up in Uncle Charlie's room?\\
198 - - Yeah. - Did you see my Game Boy?\\
199 - No.\\
200 - - Did you see my husband? - The old guy?\\
201 - - Yeah. - He's in the kitchen.\\
202 - Thanks.\\
203 - Well, that's weird.\\
204 - If I was a Game Boy, where would I be?\\
205 - I am so sorry. I had no idea that she was married.\\
206 - I have a firm rule when it comes to sleeping with married women.\\
207 - Yeah, if she's firm enough, he'll do her.\\
208 - Sorry. Isn't there something you could clean?\\
209 - I'm guessing you could use a good scrubbing.\\
210 - Wait a minute.\\
211 - "And suddenly I realized...\\
212 - ...I might have left it in my mom's car."\\
213 - Hey, Mom, did I leave my Game Boy in your car?\\
214 - Well, can you go look?\\
215 - Can't you just dry off and put on a robe?\\
216 - There's another $25 chip in it for you.\\
217 - She wasn't wearing a ring. There was no mention of a husband.\\
218 - Is that supposed to cheer me up?\\
219 - - No, no, no. I just wanted you to know... - Now, now. I get it.\\
220 - You're a nice guy, and I married a skeevy tramp.\\
221 - No, no, no. I mean, yeah, I am a nice guy...\\
222 - ...but I'm sure Annette is a lovely woman.\\
223 - Her name is Natalie.\\
224 - - Really? You sure? - Yes, I'm sure.\\
225 - Because I've been yelling "Annette" all night.\\
226 - Her name is Natalie.\\
227 - Well, then maybe this is all just a huge misunderstanding...\\
228 - ...and I've been upstairs doing someone else's wife.\\
229 - Five-foot six, long brown hair, butterfly tattoo on her left hip.\\
230 - Left hip, huh?\\
231 - Hold on now. A lot of women have butterfly tattoos.\\
232 - But the one I slept with also had a little beauty mark in a certain intimate place.\\
233 - I'm not here to claim a lost wallet.\\
234 - Okay, let's just assume it's her. Again, I am really sorry.\\
235 - It's my own fault anyway.\\
236 - I should've realized back when I married her...\\
237 - ...a man my age couldn't satisfy a woman that young.\\
238 - If it makes you feel any better, I couldn't ring her bell, either.\\
239 - - You couldn't? - You don't know me...\\
240 - ...but there's things I don't kid about.\\
241 - So it's not just me.\\
242 - - That's a relief. - Tell me...\\
243 - ...about it. I was killing myself up there.\\
244 - So anyway...\\
245 - ...are we okay?\\
246 - You mean, aside from the fact that you just rolled off my wife?\\
247 - Oh, yeah. We're aces.\\
248 - Good. Thank you.\\
249 - - Can I give you a little advice, kid? - Sure.\\
250 - I was a player once, like you.\\
251 - Do tell.\\
252 - Does the name Tuesday Weld mean anything to you?\\
253 - No.\\
254 - Joey Heatherton?\\
255 - No.\\
256 - The immortal Miss Anne Francis.\\
257 - TV's Honey West.\\
258 - - Sorry. - Well, look them up on your Internet.\\
259 - They were all hot, and I nailed them.\\
260 - Really. Well, kudos.\\
261 - But nothing lasts forever.\\
262 - There's going to come a time when you'll wanna settle down.\\
263 - And I only hope you don't make the same mistake I did.\\
264 - I picked a young hottie...\\
265 - ...because I figured I'd die in the sack with a smile on my face.\\
266 - That's my retirement plan.\\
267 - But it doesn't work that way.\\
268 - What happens is...\\
269 - ...you get your heart broken...\\
270 - ...and you wind up having coffee with some putz...\\
271 - ...who never heard of Honey West.\\
272 - Got it.\\
273 - Thanks for the advice.\\
274 - Well, I'll be getting home now.\\
275 - I got lawyers to call, locks to change.\\
276 - Maybe I'll stop at the market, pick up some of those cookies.\\
277 - - Here. Take the box. - Oh, thanks.\\
278 - Looks like I'm the big winner around here today.\\
279 - - Hello? Anybody home? - Hello.\\
280 - - Hello. Who are you? - Norman.\\
281 - Oh, hello, Norman. I'm Evelyn.\\
282 - Is that your magnificent Rolls-Royce out in the drive?\\
283 - Why, yes, it is.\\
284 - - Are you a friend of Charlie's? - No.\\
285 - But my wife is.\\
286 - Did my son polish your trophy wife?\\
287 - Well, you seem like a very intelligent man.\\
288 - I assume you had an airtight prenup.\\
289 - Bulletproof.\\
290 - You know what, Norman?\\
291 - You look a lot like my fifth husband.\\
292 - Really? How many times you been married?\\
293 - Four.\\
294 - Cookie?\\
295 - "When Grandma came over, I thought things couldn't get any worse.\\
296 - But instead of making me visit...\\
297 - ...she gave my dad money to take me, my uncle and Berta to the movies.\\
298 - We saw the Rob Schneider movie where he plays a stupid guy.\\
299 - I had popcorn, nachos and two jumbo red Slurpees.\\
300 - But as you know, you don't buy Slurpees. You rent them."\\
301 - - Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. - Cool your jets.\\
302 - And if you can't cool them, point the nozzle away from me.\\
303 - Oh, God. Mom!\\
304 - - We can't go in right now. - Why not?\\
305 - Because I can't afford to send you to therapy for the rest of your life.\\
306 - What's going on?\\
307 - - Oh, God! - What? What, what, what?\\
308 - Good for Norman. That's getting right back on the horse.\\
309 - - There's a horse in there? - No, no. No horse.\\
310 - - Well, I still have to pee. - So go water that bush over there.\\
311 - "And so I did. And it just goes to show...\\
312 - ...it's always in the last place you look."\\
313 - Very nice, Jake.\\
314 - "Then on Sunday, we all went out for breakfast...\\
315 - ...with Grandma and Uncle Norman.\\
316 - I had chocolate-chip pancakes with blueberry syrup and bacon.\\
317 - Dad had scrambled eggs but with no yolks. Just the whites.\\
318 - They looked like mashed potatoes.\\
319 - Then the kid next to us threw up his waffles. It was awesome."\\
320 - - So, what's new in school? - Almost got an A on my paper.\\
321 - What do you mean "almost"?\\
322 - Got a C.\\
323 - Okay, that's... That's fine. That's an improvement.\\
324 - Minus.\\
325 - Still, here's your dollar.\\
326 - You're paying him for a C-minus?\\
327 - That was our deal. A buck for every C, a car for every A.\\
328 - - A car? - Safest bet in the world.\\
329 - - So, what was the report about? - What we did last weekend.\\
330 - - No kidding? - Yeah. And guess what else happened.\\
331 - Trevor Griffin saw a ginormous rat in the cafeteria.\\
332 - Yeah, but about the paper.\\
333 - You wrote about everything that happened here last weekend?\\
334 - Well, everything but the boring stuff.\\
335 - Oh, this could be problematic.\\
336 - No, it's called "summarizing."\\
337 - - Can I see it? - Sure.\\
338 - But it's at Mom's house. I gave it to her to read this weekend.\\
339 - He's 11. There's no way it stands up in court.\\
340 - Does this smell funny to you?

1 - I'm sure she's a lovely girl, Mom,\\
2 - but I have a strict policy against blind dates.\\
3 - Yes, I know I'm not God's gift to women, but, nevertheless...\\
4 - Oh, come on. How do you know\\
5 - what she can suck through a garden hose?\\
6 - Doesn't matter. The policy stands.\\
7 - Okay, bye.\\
8 - You know, while I applaud\\
9 - your blind date policy,\\
10 - I would encourage you\\
11 - to consider a garden hose exemption.\\
12 - I'm sorry, but you remember\\
13 - the last time I let Mom fix me up.\\
14 - Oh, yeah. The enema freak.\\
15 - She was a colonic irrigation therapist.\\
16 - Tomato, tomahto...\\
17 - You still wound up\\
18 - with five gallons of coffee up your keister.\\
19 - Not a pleasant memory.\\
20 - I can't remember it without chuckling.\\
21 - These days, they'll open a Starbucks anywhere.\\
22 - Are you done?\\
23 - No. Wait. One more.\\
24 - You had the venti nonfat "crappuccino"...\\
25 - ...with extra foam.\\
26 - Mmm.\\
27 - Okay, I'm done.\\
28 - So what's wrong with the TV?\\
29 - I don't know. I think that storm last night\\
30 - messed up the satellite dish.\\
31 - I'll call the guy on Monday.\\
32 - That's your answer for everything.\\
33 - "Call the guy."\\
34 - Not for everything.\\
35 - Often, I'll call the girl.\\
36 - Course, there was the one time\\
37 - that the girl turned out to be the guy.\\
38 - Needless to say, I got a full cash refund.\\
39 - Well, you don't have to call the guy this time.\\
40 - You just have to adjust the dish till the signal clears up.\\
41 - Which is what the guy will do on Monday.\\
42 - But Jake is coming tonight.\\
43 - Do you really want to listen\\
44 - to him complain about the TV all weekend?\\
45 - I can deal with Jake.\\
46 - It's your whining that makes me want to hang myself.\\
47 - Come on. Help me get the ladder.\\
48 - I'll go up on the roof,\\
49 - and we'll fix it in five minutes.\\
50 - I have a ladder?\\
51 - How did I get a ladder?\\
52 - For the life of me,\\
53 - I can't remember buying a ladder.\\
54 - Well, apparently, you did.\\
55 - But why? And how did I get it home?\\
56 - I really couldn't tell you.\\
57 - Did I rent a truck?\\
58 - Who knows?\\
59 - I'm telling you, we got a real mystery on our hands.\\
60 - Yeah. It's a puzzler.\\
61 - I'm going to go up and adjust the dish,\\
62 - and you go look at the TV\\
63 - and tell me when the picture improves.\\
64 - All right.\\
65 - I still think we should call the guy.\\
66 - Forget the guy!\\
67 - I'm the guy!\\
68 - Charlie!\\
69 - Yeah?!\\
70 - There's a pair of panties up here.\\
71 - Of course. The ladder.\\
72 - Alan, mystery solved!\\
73 - What?\\
74 - Never mind.\\
75 - Focus on the job at hand.\\
76 - Are you watching the TV?\\
77 - Yes.\\
78 - How's it look now?\\
79 - It's a little better.\\
80 - How about now?\\
81 - No. That's worse.\\
82 - Move it the other way.\\
83 - What?\\
84 - There, there, there!\\
85 - That's perfect!\\
86 - What?!\\
87 - I said, that's perfect!\\
88 - Great! I'm coming down!\\
89 - ( screaming )\\
90 - Did you say something?\\
91 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
92 - * Men... *\\
93 - I told you.\\
94 - We should have called the guy.\\
95 - Aw. You want to flip me the bird,\\
96 - but the poor little fella can't fly.\\
97 - Just help me lie down.\\
98 - There is a bright side here, you know.\\
99 - Oh, really? Really? And what might the bright side be?\\
100 - Handicapped parking?\\
101 - Pity sex?\\
102 - Oh, I can see there's going\\
103 - to be no talking to you about this.\\
104 - Oh, oh. Do me a favor,\\
105 - and call Judith and tell her\\
106 - not to bring Jake over.\\
107 - How come?\\
108 - Look at me, Charlie.\\
109 - I have abrasions, contusions, a severely sprained neck,\\
110 - two fractured fingers, and I'm hopped up on pain pills.\\
111 - Does that spell "Weekend Dad" to you?\\
112 - Well, actually, to me,\\
113 - it spells "Weekend in Bangkok with two Olympic gymnasts."\\
114 - But that's a whole other story.\\
115 - Look, I got no plans for the weekend.\\
116 - I could take care of Jake.\\
117 - Bangkok?\\
118 - It was the '80s.\\
119 - A simpler time.\\
120 - The dollar was strong.\\
121 - Come on.\\
122 - I was kind of looking forward to hanging out\\
123 - with the little knucklehead. Let him come over.\\
124 - But I'm not going to be able to help you.\\
125 - What are you going to do all weekend?\\
126 - I don't know. Hey, maybe I'll get a chute.\\
127 - We could play chutes and ladders.\\
128 - See, that's why I want Jake here.\\
129 - He has a sense of humor.\\
130 - Well, all right.\\
131 - If... if you think you can handle it.\\
132 - Don't worry. I got everything covered.\\
133 - Thank you. You're welcome.\\
134 - Is there anything I can do for you now?\\
135 - Well, I got to pee.\\
136 - Yeah. So?\\
137 - So I can't undo my pants or... anything.\\
138 - Where are we headed with this, Alan?\\
139 - You said you'd help me.\\
140 - I was thinking more like I could make you a sandwich.\\
141 - Charlie... Hey, hey, hey.\\
142 - I am not reaching into your pants.\\
143 - What am I supposed to do?\\
144 - Go stand in the surf.\\
145 - Oh, come on.\\
146 - Grow up.\\
147 - Where are you going?\\
148 - To the bathroom. Now, come on and unzip me.\\
149 - Just like that? Right to it?\\
150 - No dinner? No movie?\\
151 - Charlie!\\
152 - Hold on!\\
153 - Coming!\\
154 - * Men\\
155 - Ah... ah... ah-choo!\\
156 - Holy God!\\
157 - ( doorbell rings )\\
158 - Charlie?\\
159 - Can you get the door?\\
160 - Charlie?\\
161 - ( doorbell rings )\\
162 - Hang on!\\
163 - Charlie!\\
164 - Oh, great.\\
165 - I think I just punctured a lung.\\
166 - ( doorbell rings )\\
167 - ( imitating Charlie ): "Don't worry, Alan.\\
168 - I've got everything covered."\\
169 - ( doorbell rings )\\
170 - I'm coming!\\
171 - Ow!\\
172 - You need to start your report this weekend!\\
173 - Why? It's not due till next Wednesday!\\
174 - I have plenty of time.\\
175 - That's what you said last time.\\
176 - No, I didn't.\\
177 - Yes, you did.\\
178 - I think you're getting senile.\\
179 - Watch your mouth, young man.\\
180 - I can't watch it.\\
181 - It's under my nose.\\
182 - Uh... hello.\\
183 - What happened to you?\\
184 - Well, most recently,\\
185 - I was hit in the head by a door.\\
186 - But, before that, I was fixing\\
187 - the satellite dish on the roof\\
188 - and I kind of fell.\\
189 - Why didn't you just call the guy?\\
190 - Well, for God's sake, Alan,\\
191 - how do you intend to look after him this weekend?\\
192 - I am in excruciating pain,\\
193 - but I appreciate your concern.\\
194 - Oh. Well, you could have picked up a phone\\
195 - and given me a heads-up.\\
196 - Pick up the phone?\\
197 - Judith, I needed barbecue tongs to take a leak.\\
198 - Can you look after Jake or not?\\
199 - Well, Charlie said he'd look after him.\\
200 - Oh, like hell he will.\\
201 - There is no way I'm going to let your degenerate brother\\
202 - be responsible for my son.\\
203 - JAKE: Oh, sure.\\
204 - Don't ask me what I want.\\
205 - Just boss me around like you're my boss or something.\\
206 - Charlie will be fine. Have a good weekend.\\
207 - Thanks.\\
208 - You, too.\\
209 - Can we go out to dinner tonight?\\
210 - Do I look like I'm in any kind of shape to go to dinner?\\
211 - I don't know. I'm not a doctor.\\
212 - The answer is no.\\
213 - Okay.\\
214 - Then can we go to the video store\\
215 - and rent the new "Final Fantasy"?\\
216 - Jake, I hurt myself.\\
217 - I'm in a lot of pain.\\
218 - So? When I took a soccer ball to the nads,\\
219 - I was in a lot of pain\\
220 - and all my coach said was, "Walk it off."\\
221 - Well, you can't just walk this off.\\
222 - Not with that attitude.\\
223 - Hey, there he is.\\
224 - How's it going, buddy?\\
225 - My life stinks.\\
226 - Cheer up. You're still a kid.\\
227 - It's going to get much worse.\\
228 - Where have you been?\\
229 - Taking a nap.\\
230 - Why?\\
231 - I find it refreshes me.\\
232 - You said you were going to take care of everything.\\
233 - Yeah. So?\\
234 - So, while you were sleeping, I had to answer the door.\\
235 - Do you realize how petty you sound right now?\\
236 - Relax. Lie down. I got it covered.\\
237 - No, you don't.\\
238 - Nothing is covered.\\
239 - It's all coverless.\\
240 - Now, there's a life that stinks.\\
241 - So, what's on the agenda? What do you want to do?\\
242 - I want to go out to dinner.\\
243 - Yeah? Well, I want my own talk show.\\
244 - You'll eat what we've got.\\
245 - Why can't we go out?\\
246 - Alan, I can't deal with this.\\
247 - Talk to your son.\\
248 - That's it? You... you're done covering?\\
249 - Well, I didn't know he was going be impossible.\\
250 - Hey, don't talk about me like I'm not here.\\
251 - Keep yappin', and you won't be.\\
252 - Charlie, just take him to dinner.\\
253 - Why should I?\\
254 - 'Cause he's not going to shut up\\
255 - till he gets what he wants.\\
256 - That's true. I'll drive you crazy.\\
257 - Yeah? Well, do your worst.\\
258 - If we go out to dinner, there's nothing to clean up.\\
259 - We're not going out to dinner.\\
260 - You usually want to go out to dinner.\\
261 - Not tonight.\\
262 - You're not punishing me.\\
263 - You're just punishing yourself.\\
264 - Back off, bobblehead.\\
265 - Oh, come on. It'll be fun.\\
266 - We're not going.\\
267 - Why not?\\
268 - This conversation's over.\\
269 - Not if I keep talking.\\
270 - So where do you want to eat?\\
271 - Clucky's.\\
272 - What's Clucky's?\\
273 - Zesty fire-roasted chicken\\
274 - with Grandma Clucky's secret herbs and spices.\\
275 - All right. Where is it?\\
276 - There are several convenient locations.\\
277 - Like where?\\
278 - I don't know. I just sit in the car.\\
279 - Well, I've never seen a Clucky's around here.\\
280 - How about a pizza? No.\\
281 - Burgers? No.\\
282 - Sushi? Ech.\\
283 - Italian? No.\\
284 - Chinese. No.\\
285 - Clucky's? No.\\
286 - You're not even listening!\\
287 - I mean, yes.\\
288 - Clucky's.\\
289 - Well, forget it.\\
290 - I'm not driving all over this city\\
291 - hoping to stumble across a Clucky's.\\
292 - This isn't the Clucky's my mom takes me to.\\
293 - No kidding.\\
294 - Where are we anyway?\\
295 - It's called Watts.\\
296 - Now hurry up and finish your chicken.\\
297 - I like the Cajun Clucky's better.\\
298 - Good for you.\\
299 - Can I go back and get some Cajun Clucky's?\\
300 - No, eat what you got.\\
301 - But I like the Cajun Clucky's better.\\
302 - Then why did you order the regular Clucky's?\\
303 - Because I forgot I like the Cajun Clucky's.\\
304 - Oh, just eat the freakin' chicken.\\
305 - Fine.\\
306 - Why do you say "freakin'"?\\
307 - I know what you mean. I'm not a little kid anymore.\\
308 - Eat. Don't talk, eat!\\
309 - 'Sup?\\
310 - Gotta pee.\\
311 - Charlie, get the tongs.\\
312 - Charlie?!\\
313 - ( groans ): Oh, boy.\\
314 - ( imitates "William Tell Overture" ): * Gotta pee, gotta pee\\
315 - * Gotta pee, pee, pee\\
316 - * Gotta pee, gotta pee, gotta pee, pee, pee *\\
317 - * Gotta pee, gotta pee, gotta pee, pee, pee... *\\
318 - EVELYN: Alan?\\
319 - I've got somebody who wants to meet you.\\
320 - Not a good time, Mom.\\
321 - Yes, I can see that.\\
322 - Are you all right?\\
323 - No, not really.\\
324 - Oh, my poor baby.\\
325 - Well, anyway, Mona, Alan.\\
326 - Alan, Mona.\\
327 - Hi, Mona.\\
328 - Hello.\\
329 - What happened to you?\\
330 - I was fixing the satellite dish and I fell off the roof.\\
331 - Oh. Why didn't you just call the guy?\\
332 - Want to know why I didn't call the guy?\\
333 - I'll tell you why I didn't call the guy.\\
334 - Because you don't need to call the guy!\\
335 - It's a simple adjustment that any idiot can do!\\
336 - And, yes, I know,\\
337 - this idiot fell off the roof\\
338 - but it was after I fixed it all by myself,\\
339 - no guy!\\
340 - Okay, the ice has been broken.\\
341 - I'll just give you Mona's number\\
342 - and you can call her sometime\\
343 - when it's more convenient.\\
344 - Come along, dear.\\
345 - Do you just stay awake nights,\\
346 - trying to think of new ways to embarrass me?\\
347 - Still gotta pee.\\
348 - Oh, God!\\
349 - Oh, what the hell.\\
350 - ( sighs ): Ahh...\\
351 - Oh, yeah.\\
352 - The Cajun Clucky's is way better.\\
353 - I'll notify Zagat's.\\
354 - Hey, before stop at the video store,\\
355 - can we get some ice cream?\\
356 - Who said we're stopping at the video store?\\
357 - I wanna rent the new "Final Fantasy."\\
358 - Yeah, well, I want my $80,000 Mercedes\\
359 - not to smell like chicken.\\
360 - But life is full of little disappointments.\\
361 - Okay, forget the ice cream.\\
362 - We'll just stop at the video store.\\
363 - Jake, I'm tired, I've got a headache,\\
364 - I just paid a hundred dollars\\
365 - to get my car back from the "chicken valet,"\\
366 - and I want to go home.\\
367 - Please.\\
368 - I'm sorry, what part of "no" did you not understand?\\
369 - The "nnn" or the "oh"?\\
370 - How about if we just stop in front of the store,\\
371 - I'll run in and get the video game\\
372 - and you just wait in the car?\\
373 - How about we stop by the video store\\
374 - and I just stuff you through the return slot?\\
375 - I wouldn't fit.\\
376 - Try me.\\
377 - Oh, come on, it'll only take a minute.\\
378 - Look, Jake, you might be able to bully your parents\\
379 - into doing whatever you want,\\
380 - but when I say "no," that's it.\\
381 - Okay. Then I guess I won't have a video game\\
382 - to play this weekend.\\
383 - Exactly. You'll find something else to do.\\
384 - Right. It'll just be you and me.\\
385 - They're all out of "Final Fantasy."\\
386 - So get something else.\\
387 - But I want "Final Fantasy."\\
388 - Are you telling me that out of this entire store,\\
389 - thousands of movies and video games,\\
390 - there's nothing here that interests you?\\
391 - You're not gonna like the answer.\\
392 - I'm having chest pains.\\
393 - You're giving me chest pains.\\
394 - I bet they have "Final Fantasy" at another store.\\
395 - You want a final fantasy?\\
396 - Close your eyes\\
397 - and imagine yourself flying across a freakin' video store,\\
398 - 'cause that's what's about to happen.\\
399 - Again with the "freakin'."\\
400 - Excuse me, but did I hear you say\\
401 - you were looking for "Final Fantasy"?\\
402 - I was about to return one.\\
403 - You can have it.\\
404 - Thanks. You're welcome.\\
405 - He's really something, isn't he?\\
406 - Oh, yeah, he's something.\\
407 - Question is "What?"\\
408 - I have a boy his age.\\
409 - Single mom.\\
410 - Single uncle.\\
411 - Betsy.\\
412 - Charlie. Jake.\\
413 - Nobody asked you.\\
414 - So, uh, Betsy,\\
415 - maybe we can get the boys together\\
416 - for a little play date sometime.\\
417 - I don't want a play date with some stupid kid\\
418 - just so you can have sex with her.\\
419 - Isn't he something?\\
420 - Yeah.\\
421 - Um, well, it was nice meeting you.\\
422 - Bye-bye.\\
423 - What?\\
424 - Are you happy?\\
425 - Pretty much. You?\\
426 - Oy.\\
427 - ( groans ): Agh. Agh. Agh. Agh.\\
428 - Hello.\\
429 - "Controlled substance.\\
430 - Do not exceed one pill every six hours."\\
431 - Yeah, right.\\
432 - ( groans )\\
433 - Oh, what fresh child-proof hell is this?\\
434 - Come on, you bastard.\\
435 - Yes!\\
436 - Ow.\\
437 - What are we doing?\\
438 - I'm taking you back to your mother.\\
439 - ( doorbell rings )\\
440 - Why?\\
441 - Why? I'll tell you why.\\
442 - Because you're no fun anymore.\\
443 - Because the whole "isn't he cute" thing is over.\\
444 - And I'll tell you something else:\\
445 - if this is a prelude\\
446 - to what you're gonna be like as a teenager,\\
447 - then we've got a serious problem.\\
448 - Whatever.\\
449 - You see? You see, right there!\\
450 - That attitude does not fly with me.\\
451 - Whatever.\\
452 - God, I hope that's the chicken.\\
453 - ( doorbell rings )\\
454 - She's not home. Ha-ha.\\
455 - Do not "ha-ha" me.\\
456 - Never "ha-ha" me.\\
457 - ( knocking loudly ) Judith!\\
458 - Come get your kid!\\
459 - ( banging )\\
460 - Don't hide behind the couch!\\
461 - I can see you, Judith!\\
462 - ( banging )\\
463 - Ha-ha.\\
464 - Uh-oh.\\
465 - * Men\\
466 - Hey, how 'bout some ice cream?\\
467 - Sure.\\
468 - Listen, I'm sorry I lost my temper.\\
469 - I'm sorry you slipped in dog crap chasing me.\\
470 - Thank you.\\
471 - Now, you know that I love you,\\
472 - but we've gotta be clear on a couple of things.\\
473 - I get that you're growing up,\\
474 - that your body's changing,\\
475 - that your emotions are in flux.\\
476 - But the important thing you need to keep in mind\\
477 - is that I don't care.\\
478 - When you're in my house, when you're out with me\\
479 - and especially when we're around women,\\
480 - you will be adorable. Got it?\\
481 - Shh, I'm trying to concentrate.\\
482 - Don't shush me.\\
483 - Never shush me.\\
484 - Whatever.\\
485 - Please be the chicken.\\
486 - Pour me one of those, will ya?\\
487 - You know, mixing those pills with alcohol\\
488 - is a really bad idea.\\
489 - Not if you're trying to die.\\
490 - Hey, how many of those pills you got left?
\subsection {Episode 02: Principal Gallagher's Lesbian Lover}
1 - Hey, Doc, how many more adjustments\\
2 - do you think I'm going to need?\\
3 - Well, Mr. Malinkovich, let's see.\\
4 - Um, my son won't graduate college till 2015, so...\\
5 - a lot.\\
6 - See you next time.\\
7 - Okay, Mr. Dunlop.\\
8 - It's good to see you again, sir.\\
9 - And, uh, how are we doing today?\\
10 - Not good.\\
11 - I was making love to my wife last night.\\
12 - Oh, my God, is she okay?\\
13 - She's fine. She was on top.\\
14 - But my back went out, Doc.\\
15 - Okay, well, let's, uh,\\
16 - get you on the table and get to work.\\
17 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
18 - Steady there, big fella.\\
19 - I took some pain pills\\
20 - my wife had left over from her C-section.\\
21 - I guess my legs are a little rubbery.\\
22 - How many pills did you take?\\
23 - Well, let's see.\\
24 - One when I went to bed...\\
25 - Mm-hmm. one when I got up...\\
26 - Seven.\\
27 - Really?\\
28 - You know, it's not usually a good idea\\
29 - to pop Class-A narcotics like Skittles.\\
30 - Doc, I gotta lie down.\\
31 - Okay, okay, but not here, n-not now.\\
32 - No, no, no, no, no!\\
33 - Oh, my God!\\
34 - Mr. Dunlop!\\
35 - Mr. Dunlop, you need to get up.\\
36 - Help!\\
37 - Fire!\\
38 - Big giant guy!\\
39 - ( cell phone ring tone plays "Fur Elise" )\\
40 - Oh, perfect.\\
41 - ( grunting )\\
42 - Dr. Harper speaking.\\
43 - Judith, this is not a good time.\\
44 - I'm with a patient.\\
45 - Well, what about Jake?\\
46 - Well, no, I can't pick him up at school now.\\
47 - W-Why can't you do it?\\
48 - You're not the only one under pressure, Judith!\\
49 - All right, I'll call Charlie and have him pick him up.\\
50 - Mm...\\
51 - Hey, hey, stop that.\\
52 - Stop that.\\
53 - ( phone ringing )\\
54 - Do you need to get it?\\
55 - Nah, the machine'll pick up.\\
56 - ( tape clicking )\\
57 - Hey, it's Charlie.\\
58 - Do your thing when you hear the beep.\\
59 - ( beep )\\
60 - ALAN: Charlie, I need your help.\\
61 - Oh, pick up, pick up, pick up!\\
62 - For God's sake!\\
63 - ( beep )\\
64 - See?\\
65 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
66 - * Men... *\\
67 - Hey, look who's here.\\
68 - Hi.\\
69 - How come you're not in school?\\
70 - He got sent home-- for misbehaving.\\
71 - Well, it's about time.\\
72 - Hey, when I was your age,\\
73 - I had already been arrested twice.\\
74 - Charlie, don't.\\
75 - No convictions.\\
76 - Come on. I've had a really bad day.\\
77 - I had to cancel all my patients\\
78 - and close my office to go pick him up.\\
79 - Wow, what a drag.\\
80 - Hey, I got\\
81 - some new video games.\\
82 - You wanna play with me?\\
83 - Sure. Did you forget\\
84 - you're being punished?\\
85 - No, but why does Uncle Charlie have to suffer?\\
86 - Go to your room.\\
87 - You know, in some countries\\
88 - you're innocent until proven guilty.\\
89 - You confessed.\\
90 - Oh, yeah.\\
91 - And that country you're thinking of is this one, genius!\\
92 - What'd he do? Something awful.\\
93 - How awful?\\
94 - These are all multi-player games.\\
95 - Apparently, there is\\
96 - a little girl in Jake's class named Barbara Schmidt\\
97 - who is a little more physically developed\\
98 - than the other girls, and Jake decided\\
99 - to make a picture of her and pass it around.\\
100 - I only passed it to one person.\\
101 - What happened after that was not my responsibility.\\
102 - Aw, dude! Why'd you sign it?\\
103 - Okay, that part I regret.\\
104 - Go back to your room.\\
105 - "Boobra Schmidt."\\
106 - I'm putting this one on the refrigerator.\\
107 - Charlie, this is serious.\\
108 - It really speaks to me.\\
109 - The girl went home in tears, her mother is on the warpath\\
110 - and Jake could get expelled.\\
111 - For a silly drawing?\\
112 - It's considered sexual harassment.\\
113 - The school has a zero-tolerance policy.\\
114 - Oh, for the good old days\\
115 - when you could wander into the girls' locker room\\
116 - pretending you were blind.\\
117 - You actually did that? That's horrible.\\
118 - No, the horrible part\\
119 - was stealing the dog from the blind kid.\\
120 - Well, unfortunately, times have changed and we no longer live\\
121 - in a Porky's movie.\\
122 - JAKE: What's a Porky's movie?!\\
123 - Close the door!\\
124 - I'll be in to talk with you in a minute!\\
125 - ( door closes ) Alan, go easy on him.\\
126 - He doesn't understand what he did wrong.\\
127 - JAKE: He's right! I don't have a clue!\\
128 - I thought I told you to close the door!\\
129 - It is closed.\\
130 - Go in your room!\\
131 - JAKE: Fine.\\
132 - You know what?\\
133 - Maybe I should talk to him.\\
134 - Oh. Oh, now you want to help?\\
135 - What's that supposed to mean?\\
136 - It means why didn't you pick up the phone\\
137 - when I needed you this afternoon?\\
138 - Um... I didn't want to?\\
139 - See? See?\\
140 - I can't depend on you.\\
141 - I never have been able to depend on you,\\
142 - and I never will be able to depend on you,\\
143 - and you know why?\\
144 - Because I'm undependable?\\
145 - Yes! Yes! Undependable and, an-and selfish,\\
146 - and frankly, I'm the idiot, because I deluded myself\\
147 - into believing that when I desperately\\
148 - needed my brother to go pick up my kid at school,\\
149 - he might actually bother to pick up the freaking phone!\\
150 - Okay, okay, in my defense,\\
151 - I really didn't want to.\\
152 - Okay, you're right.\\
153 - I'm sorry, I-I should've picked up the phone.\\
154 - Forget it. What's done is done.\\
155 - No sense grinding on it.\\
156 - Thank you.\\
157 - I just have to accept the fact that I-I can't count on anyone,\\
158 - least of all an emotionally immature narcissist\\
159 - who thinks that the sun rises out of his navel\\
160 - and sets in his scrotum\\
161 - and only cares about what lies between the two.\\
162 - Okay, I'm no expert, but that sounds a lot like "grinding."\\
163 - I am done talking to you.\\
164 - Come on, Alan, I said I was sorry.\\
165 - Give me another chance.\\
166 - For what? To let me down again?\\
167 - Tell me what I can do. Name something. Anything.\\
168 - Okay, okay.\\
169 - I have to go to Jake's school tomorrow\\
170 - to see if I can keep him from being expelled.\\
171 - You want me to go with you? I am there. You can count on me.\\
172 - No, my receptionist is out sick all week and I need somebody\\
173 - to handle the phones while I'm gone.\\
174 - In your office?\\
175 - Yes.\\
176 - Way out in the Valley?\\
177 - Yes.\\
178 - All day?\\
179 - Yes.\\
180 - Gee, tomorrow's not really good for me.\\
181 - All right, all right, what time?\\
182 - The office opens at eight.\\
183 - O'clock?\\
184 - No, degrees.\\
185 - No reason to be snide. I just don't want to be late.\\
186 - Fine.\\
187 - We leave at seven.\\
188 - O'clock?\\
189 - * Men.\\
190 - ALAN: Okay, Charlie!\\
191 - Time to get up and go to work!\\
192 - Charlie?\\
193 - Of course.\\
194 - Never even came home.\\
195 - Why help your only brother\\
196 - when you can be out boffing total strangers?\\
197 - "I'll be there for you."\\
198 - "You can count on me."\\
199 - My own fault.\\
200 - I'm just stupid and gullible.\\
201 - And annoying. Don't forget annoying.\\
202 - You're here.\\
203 - You said 7:00, right?\\
204 - You got yourself up?\\
205 - Didn't have to.\\
206 - Why not?\\
207 - Didn't sleep.\\
208 - You haven't been to bed?\\
209 - Not my bed.\\
210 - Hey, you want some coffee?\\
211 - I made some coffee.\\
212 - It's really good coffee. Oop, no more coffee.\\
213 - Why don't you make\\
214 - some more coffee while I go take a squirt?\\
215 - Morning.\\
216 - Yo, Berta. Berta, Bert, Bert, Bert.\\
217 - He just getting home?\\
218 - Yeah.\\
219 - You gotta wonder how long he can keep\\
220 - burnin' that penis at both ends.\\
221 - I try not to think about it.\\
222 - Um... Listen,\\
223 - Charlie is coming with me to work today.\\
224 - Why?\\
225 - He's gonna help me at the office.\\
226 - You want to bet?\\
227 - What's up with Uncle Charlie?\\
228 - What do you mean?\\
229 - He's peein' off the deck.\\
230 - I thought we weren't allowed to do that.\\
231 - We're not.\\
232 - We're not?!\\
233 - No, we're not.\\
234 - Okay.\\
235 - What's the Oompa Loompa doing here on a weekday?\\
236 - He got suspended from school.\\
237 - Why isn't he with his mother?\\
238 - Uh, Judith had a little liposuction yesterday\\
239 - and she needs to stay in bed until she...\\
240 - stops leaking fat.\\
241 - Yeah, I hate it when that happens.\\
242 - So what did the melonhead do?\\
243 - Oh, it's a long story.\\
244 - Ah!\\
245 - Worth a thousand words.\\
246 - Come on, Charlie!\\
247 - Let's go!\\
248 - Hang on. I'm not done yet!\\
249 - Oh, will you leave the seagulls alone?!\\
250 - For crying out loud!\\
251 - So...\\
252 - You like making fun of girls with big boobs.\\
253 - Not anymore.\\
254 - * Men.\\
255 - ( humming "Tequila" )\\
256 - ( humming "Tequila" )\\
257 - Gridlock!\\
258 - ( humming "Tequila" ) Stop.\\
259 - People do this\\
260 - every day?\\
261 - Drive to work at eight miles an hour?\\
262 - Pretty much.\\
263 - I'd have to kill myself.\\
264 - Oh, click.\\
265 - What?\\
266 - I just had a phenomenal business idea.\\
267 - They haven't perfected personal jet packs yet.\\
268 - Oh.\\
269 - Okay, I have another one.\\
270 - We buy a donut machine and put it in your trunk.\\
271 - Let's go back to the jet packs.\\
272 - Hear me out.\\
273 - The next time you're stuck in a traffic jam,\\
274 - you just pop your trunk\\
275 - Uh-huh.\\
276 - We'll call 'em... Gridnuts...\\
277 - Trunk Crullers...\\
278 - Stop 'n' Go-Nuts.\\
279 - Charlie?\\
280 - Yeah? Please stop talking.\\
281 - Okay.\\
282 - I got it!\\
283 - Trunkin' Donuts.\\
284 - ( humming "Tequila" )\\
285 - ( door chiming )\\
286 - Here it is.\\
287 - The chiropractic offices of Dr. Alan Harper.\\
288 - Wow.\\
289 - So this is where you come every day, huh?\\
290 - Yep, for 11 years.\\
291 - What do you think?\\
292 - I would've killed myself ten and a half years ago.\\
293 - Okay, now, all you have to do is sit here\\
294 - and when the phone rings, pick it up\\
295 - and say, "Dr. Harper's office."\\
296 - So right off the bat, I lie?\\
297 - I am a doctor, Charlie.\\
298 - Yeah, and I'm king of the traffic donuts.\\
299 - Moving on...\\
300 - I have canceled all the morning appointments,\\
301 - so the only thing\\
302 - you're going to have to deal with is walk-ins.\\
303 - Just have them make an appointment for another time.\\
304 - So I don't get to crack anybody's back?\\
305 - Charlie, listen to me very carefully.\\
306 - You must not touch the patients.\\
307 - This is not me talking.\\
308 - This is the State of California.\\
309 - Okay.\\
310 - Let me be absolutely clear.\\
311 - No touching the patients.\\
312 - Got it.\\
313 - What did I just say to you?\\
314 - Repeat it back to me.\\
315 - Boy, you're really not a morning person, are you?\\
316 - All right, I've got to go get to Jake's school.\\
317 - Say a prayer that I can keep him from being expelled.\\
318 - Don't worry about a thing.\\
319 - It's under control.\\
320 - You can count on me.\\
321 - Oh, if I could believe even one of those things.\\
322 - ( pencil sharpener grinding )\\
323 - Okay, where can I hang myself?\\
324 - ( phone ringing )\\
325 - Hello?\\
326 - Oh, hey, Alan...\\
327 - I said "Dr. Harper's office."\\
328 - I did.\\
329 - ( phone ringing )\\
330 - Hello?\\
331 - Damn, try it again.\\
332 - Are you waiting to see the principal?\\
333 - Uh, yeah.\\
334 - Oh, have a seat.\\
335 - Thank you.\\
336 - Uh, Alan.\\
337 - Oh, Mindy.\\
338 - Nice to meet you.\\
339 - You, too.\\
340 - Oh...\\
341 - um, you must be Boobra's mom...\\
342 - Barbara's mams...\\
343 - Hi.\\
344 - ( door chimes )\\
345 - Don't worry, Alan.\\
346 - I'm not touching the patients.\\
347 - There are human lives at stake here, man.\\
348 - I need those spines delivered immediately.\\
349 - Hello.\\
350 - Can I give you a complimentary adjustment?\\
351 - I'm here for the masseuse position.\\
352 - I see.\\
353 - Well, I'm really not authorized to do any hiring,\\
354 - but you're obviously qualified.\\
355 - So the hell with protocol, welcome aboard.\\
356 - Let me tell you something.\\
357 - Puberty is hard enough for a young girl\\
358 - without having to be leered at\\
359 - and made fun of by obnoxious little boys.\\
360 - I couldn't agree with you more.\\
361 - And I can assure you\\
362 - that I've had a long talk with Jake\\
363 - about how wrong it is to objectify women's...\\
364 - Up here. I'm up here.\\
365 - I know. I know.\\
366 - I see you.\\
367 - A-A-And let me tell you something.\\
368 - There is no one more sympathetic than I\\
369 - to the plight of the large-breasted woman.\\
370 - "Plight"?\\
371 - It's not an affliction.\\
372 - Well, no, not the breasts themselves,\\
373 - but the attendant back problems\\
374 - associated with carrying the enormous load.\\
375 - So now my breasts are a "load"?\\
376 - From a strictly engineering standpoint, yes.\\
377 - See-see, I am a chiropractor\\
378 - and I deal with the heartache of MMS all the time.\\
379 - MMS?\\
380 - Massive Mammary Syndrome.\\
381 - It's a term I coined in an article I submitted\\
382 - to the Journal of the American Chiropractic Association.\\
383 - It hasn't really caught on.\\
384 - Anyway, MMS is particularly acute among strippers,\\
385 - but they bring it on themselves\\
386 - with those humongous implants.\\
387 - Yours, on the other hand, appear quite natural.\\
388 - God-given, am I right?\\
389 - What the hell is wrong with you?\\
390 - I don't know.\\
391 - I was a bottle baby.\\
392 - I'm sorry, Dr. Harper's not in this morning,\\
393 - but if your back's really bothering you,\\
394 - we do have a masseuse on duty.\\
395 - Fine. Anything.\\
396 - Well, let's see, she just went in with a patient\\
397 - about five minutes ago, so if you don't mind waiting.\\
398 - Thank you, that was great.\\
399 - Good. Come back soon.\\
400 - Soon?\\
401 - I'll be back after lunch.\\
402 - You next? Oh, please.\\
403 - Let's go.\\
404 - What's this?\\
405 - Your cut.\\
406 - Click!\\
407 - I'm really sorry.\\
408 - Just drop it.\\
409 - You know, in my defense... well, in defense of all men,\\
410 - we do live in a mammo-centric society.\\
411 - Mammo-centric?\\
412 - Another coinage of mine.\\
413 - Hasn't really permeated the cultural zeitgeist.\\
414 - Hey, bottle baby.\\
415 - I'm up here!\\
416 - That-that perfectly illustrates my points...\\
417 - point.\\
418 - From the moment we are born,\\
419 - we are basically bombarded by breasts.\\
420 - Breasts in advertising, breasts in television, breasts in movies.\\
421 - Here a breast, there a breast,\\
422 - everywhere a breast, breast...\\
423 - Heck, you can understand the fixation.\\
424 - You're a horrible little man.\\
425 - Okay, okay, I had hoped\\
426 - that we could have a spirited exchange of ideas here,\\
427 - but if we're going to just degenerate into name-calling,\\
428 - perhaps we should wait for the principal to decide\\
429 - what a reasonable punishment for my son would be.\\
430 - Fine.\\
431 - We'll let the principal decide. Okay.\\
432 - I'm Principal Gallagher.\\
433 - Oh, God, my boy's gonna get the chair.\\
434 - Time!\\
435 - Man, is this day ever gonna end?\\
436 - Hey, Alan.\\
437 - What's going on here?\\
438 - I had another business idea.\\
439 - You what?\\
440 - Hear me out.\\
441 - What do men like better than donuts?\\
442 - Hang on.\\
443 - Time!\\
444 - * Men.\\
445 - 4,200, 4,300, 4,301, 4,302.\\
446 - I hate singles.\\
447 - Don't you hate singles?\\
448 - You turned my business into a brothel!\\
449 - I thought you'd be proud of me.\\
450 - I didn't touch a single patient.\\
451 - I left you alone for a couple of hours\\
452 - and you turned my business into a brothel!\\
453 - You know what you need?\\
454 - A nice, relaxing massage.\\
455 - Oh, shut up.\\
456 - There is a happy ending here.\\
457 - From what I saw, there was, like, 40 of 'em.\\
458 - And that's just what's on the books.\\
459 - I don't want to know about it.\\
460 - I never want to know about it.\\
461 - Okay, we'll change the subject.\\
462 - Thank you.\\
463 - How'd it go at Jake's school?\\
464 - I don't want to talk about it.\\
465 - I never want to talk about it.\\
466 - You screwed up, huh?\\
467 - In ways you can't imagine.\\
468 - So he's expelled?\\
469 - No, he's just suspended for the week.\\
470 - That's not so bad.\\
471 - It's already Wednesday.\\
472 - I, on the other hand, have been asked never to set foot\\
473 - on the grounds of Woodward Avenue Elementary School again.\\
474 - No kidding.\\
475 - And it was strongly suggested\\
476 - that I resign from the PTA.\\
477 - Whoa.\\
478 - And there was talk of a civil suit.\\
479 - Oh, and Principal Gallagher's lesbian lover\\
480 - might just drop by tonight to kick my ass.\\
481 - Remind me to charge the camcorder.\\
482 - Oh, click!\\
483 - Another great business idea.\\
484 - I don't want to hear it.\\
485 - Just listen.\\
486 - We put a massage table in the trunk of your car...\\
487 - Forget it, Charlie.\\
488 - Actually, we'd probably need a van...\\
489 - I'm not listening. Oh, come on.\\
490 - Who needs their tension relieved\\
491 - more than guys stuck in traffic?\\
492 - We'll call it...\\
493 - Bumper to Humper...\\
494 - Speed Humps...\\
495 - I got it!\\
496 - Jiffy Lube.\\
497 - Oh, wait, somebody already has that.
\subsection {Episode 03: Carpet Burns and a Bite Mark}
1 - ( sucking through teeth )\\
2 - ( sucking continues )\\
3 - Will you please stop that?!\\
4 - I got a piece of popcorn stuck in my teeth.\\
5 - So go brush them.\\
6 - I brushed them this morning.\\
7 - So go floss them.\\
8 - Oh, gross.\\
9 - ( sucks through teeth )\\
10 - Wait. I got it.\\
11 - No, that's chicken.\\
12 - When did we have chicken?\\
13 - You didn't really brush this morning, did you?\\
14 - Between you and me, I lost my toothbrush three days ago.\\
15 - Still good.\\
16 - Hey, have you met any of the ladies my dad's been dating?\\
17 - No. You?\\
18 - No.\\
19 - More chicken?\\
20 - Fingernail.\\
21 - Yours?\\
22 - I hope so.\\
23 - So, how come I don't get to meet Dad's dates?\\
24 - I don't know. Maybe 'cause you're disgusting.\\
25 - No, come on, really.\\
26 - I'm not kidding.\\
27 - For most women, you're a deal-breaker.\\
28 - But you used to say I was a babe magnet.\\
29 - You used to be little and cute.\\
30 - Now you're just old and in the way.\\
31 - That's very hurtful, Uncle Charlie.\\
32 - All right, the truth is that your dad\\
33 - doesn't want you to get attached to any of these women\\
34 - in case the relationship doesn't work out.\\
35 - Why?\\
36 - Because he loves you very much,\\
37 - and he cares about your feelings.\\
38 - You let me meet your dates.\\
39 - And what does that tell you?\\
40 - I have no idea.\\
41 - * Men, men, men, men, manly, men, men, men *\\
42 - * Oh, oh * Men... *\\
43 - ALAN: Hello?\\
44 - Hey, Dad.\\
45 - What are you doing up so late?\\
46 - Charlie, what is he doing up?\\
47 - Shh, he's asleep.\\
48 - Oh, oh, I'm sorry.\\
49 - Charlie!\\
50 - What?!\\
51 - Oh, hey, Alan.\\
52 - What is he doing up so late?\\
53 - I told him to go to bed.\\
54 - How many times did I tell you\\
55 - to go to bed? Boy, I lost count.\\
56 - See?\\
57 - So how was your date?\\
58 - It was fine.\\
59 - Did you get any?\\
60 - Did I get any what?\\
61 - Hang on.\\
62 - What's he supposed to get?\\
63 - I swear, I don't know what he's talking about.\\
64 - Go to bed!\\
65 - What are you teaching him?\\
66 - What difference does it make?\\
67 - The only thing he retains is little shards of chicken.\\
68 - Wonderful.\\
69 - So, did you get any?\\
70 - It was a nice evening.\\
71 - We had a lovely dinner.\\
72 - You know, for the record,\\
73 - "a lovely dinner" doesn't necessarily preclude\\
74 - carpet burns and a bite mark on your ass.\\
75 - In this case, it was just dinner and pleasant conversation.\\
76 - Well, that's why God gave us Cinemax and an opposable thumb.\\
77 - Good night.\\
78 - Oh, hey, Alan.\\
79 - The kid was asking about these women\\
80 - you've been going out with, why he never\\
81 - gets to meet any of them.\\
82 - Really? Uh, what... what did you tell him?\\
83 - I said it's probably because he's disgusting.\\
84 - Oh, Charlie...\\
85 - I also told him that you love him\\
86 - and that you don't want him to get attached to somebody\\
87 - and then be disappointed if things don't work out.\\
88 - Good. Thank you.\\
89 - But how come I don't get to meet them?\\
90 - 'Cause you're disgusting.\\
91 - That's very hurtful, Alan.\\
92 - Come on, really.\\
93 - What's the big secret\\
94 - with these women?\\
95 - Oh, boy, I-I really don't want to get into it.\\
96 - They're hideous, right? No.\\
97 - Insufferable? No.\\
98 - Inflatable?\\
99 - Are you insane?\\
100 - Ooh, insane. Are they insane?\\
101 - Leave me alone.\\
102 - Come on, give me a hint.\\
103 - When you go to pick them up,\\
104 - do you need a border collie to cut them off from the herd?\\
105 - Stop it!\\
106 - I'm never going to stop, Alan.\\
107 - You know me better than that.\\
108 - Okay, fine.\\
109 - I'll-I'll tell you.\\
110 - First of all, there's no women.\\
111 - Imaginary!\\
112 - My next guess was gonna be imaginary.\\
113 - Let me finish.\\
114 - It's just one woman.\\
115 - I've been seeing the same woman for several weeks now.\\
116 - I see.\\
117 - You've been playing it slow. Yes.\\
118 - And by "slow," I mean "gay."\\
119 - I can't talk to you about this.\\
120 - Alan, you hook a fish and play it too long,\\
121 - you know what you're gonna finally have\\
122 - when you reel it in? What?\\
123 - A tired fish that thinks you're gay.\\
124 - Do you drink while you're baby-sitting my son?\\
125 - Not at first, but he wears me down.\\
126 - So, what's the deal with this broad?\\
127 - She's not a broad.\\
128 - ( sighs )\\
129 - It's Judith.\\
130 - Your ex-wife?\\
131 - Yep.\\
132 - Okay. Okay, that's not fair.\\
133 - You said "no" to insufferable and insane.\\
134 - Very funny.\\
135 - Are you serious?\\
136 - And by "serious," I mean dumber than a bag of doorknobs.\\
137 - Look, we went out to dinner a couple of weeks ago\\
138 - to talk about getting Jake into a good middle school,\\
139 - and before you know it, we were laughing and...\\
140 - and having a great time.\\
141 - Well, I can see the humor\\
142 - in trying to get the little bonehead into a good school.\\
143 - But that doesn't mean you start dating your ex-wife.\\
144 - I-I know what you're thinking.\\
145 - I'm being naive, and romantic, and...\\
146 - Not even close!\\
147 - Charlie, you can't overlook\\
148 - the fact that we still have a lot in common.\\
149 - Yeah, neither of you have any respect for you.\\
150 - The point is, she wants to give it another try, and so do I.\\
151 - But we can't let Jake know\\
152 - because we don't want him to get his hopes up.\\
153 - Oh, buddy, why don't you just\\
154 - take an electric sander to your testicles?\\
155 - We're both adults, we are aware of the pitfalls,\\
156 - and we think it's worth the risk.\\
157 - ( sighs )\\
158 - Okay, fine.\\
159 - I wish you both nothing but happiness.\\
160 - Thank you.\\
161 - ( mimics electric sander )\\
162 - * Men... *\\
163 - Hello.\\
164 - ALL: Hello.\\
165 - What's going on?\\
166 - Sit down, Alan.\\
167 - We need to talk.\\
168 - Yeah, well, uh... listen, I'd love to,\\
169 - but I've got to wake up Jake so that we can...\\
170 - Let him sleep.\\
171 - Am I getting whacked?\\
172 - It was discussed, but I was overruled.\\
173 - Sit down.\\
174 - Alan, we're all here because we love you.\\
175 - And we don't want to see you make a terrible mistake.\\
176 - I'm just waiting for my toaster strudel to pop.\\
177 - ( toaster dings )\\
178 - There we go.\\
179 - You told on me.\\
180 - Hey, you wouldn't listen to reason,\\
181 - so now you're going to listen to Mom.\\
182 - Alan, sweetheart,\\
183 - you know I only want the best for you, right?\\
184 - Uh...\\
185 - I do!\\
186 - I do.\\
187 - Which is why, when Judith threw you out,\\
188 - I was right there supporting you.\\
189 - You had other options?\\
190 - Don't be naive.\\
191 - I could have sucked up to Judith\\
192 - in order to have more access to my grandson.\\
193 - But, no, I burned that bridge.\\
194 - I said horrible things to her that I can never take back.\\
195 - And, keep in mind, this is a woman\\
196 - who worked the phrase "mousy bitch" into her wedding toast.\\
197 - So, if you two reconcile, I'll have to apologize to her.\\
198 - So?\\
199 - I'd rather kill us all.\\
200 - Okay.\\
201 - Moving on.\\
202 - Rose, do you have something you'd like to say to Alan?\\
203 - Yes, thank you.\\
204 - Alan, when I first met you, I didn't care for you at all.\\
205 - You were a fussy, whiny control freak.\\
206 - Yes, and-and now?\\
207 - Oh.\\
208 - Now it doesn't bother me so much.\\
209 - CHARLIE: I think what Rose means\\
210 - is that, since the divorce,\\
211 - you've grown, you've been reborn.\\
212 - ROSE: That's not what I meant.\\
213 - If that was what I meant, that's what I would've said.\\
214 - Sorry.\\
215 - Yeah, you'll get your turn.\\
216 - Okay.\\
217 - Alan, life is all about moving on.\\
218 - Now, in the animal kingdom,\\
219 - sharks move forward while crabs move sideways.\\
220 - So the question you have to ask yourself is,\\
221 - are you a shark or a crab?\\
222 - Which way do sea monkeys move?\\
223 - ( doorbell rings )\\
224 - Okay, that's Judith.\\
225 - Now, I thank you for your concern,\\
226 - but, uh, I would appreciate it\\
227 - if nobody said anything and everybody just stayed out of it.\\
228 - ( chuckles ): Yeah, right.\\
229 - Hey, Mom. Hi, honey.\\
230 - Why aren't you dressed?\\
231 - Alan, I told you I was picking him up early.\\
232 - Why isn't he ready?\\
233 - Go get dressed. I'm sorry.\\
234 - Yeah, you're always sorry,\\
235 - but I'm always the one who has to play the bad guy.\\
236 - Damn it, Alan... Okay, he's gone.\\
237 - I was thinking about you last night.\\
238 - Really? What were you thinking?\\
239 - Just what a nice time I had.\\
240 - Yes, yes, it was.\\
241 - Alan?\\
242 - Uh-huh.\\
243 - Turn around.\\
244 - ALL: Hi, Judith.\\
245 - Hello. How are you?\\
246 - ALL: Fine.\\
247 - Bye, everybody.\\
248 - ALL: Bye, Jake.\\
249 - Bye-bye.\\
250 - ALL: Good-bye.\\
251 - Thanks for staying out of it.\\
252 - ALL: You're welcome.\\
253 - * Men... *\\
254 - I got a surprise for you.\\
255 - ALAN: Can it wait?\\
256 - Jake forgot his math book.\\
257 - I'm going to run it over to Judith's.\\
258 - No, no, no, no, no, you can't go to Judith's.\\
259 - The surprise is ready now.\\
260 - Okay. What is it?\\
261 - Ta-da!\\
262 - Oh, for God's sake.\\
263 - Wait, there's more.\\
264 - Twins, Alan!\\
265 - I got 'em for you,\\
266 - but you can share if you want.\\
267 - Charlie, no.\\
268 - Fine, you can have them both.\\
269 - Bad luck to split sisters anyway.\\
270 - I don't want either of 'em. I'm going over to Judith's.\\
271 - I don't think you're getting the full picture here.\\
272 - Turn around!\\
273 - Show him the full picture!\\
274 - Huh? Huh?\\
275 - That's daily Pilates classes and one meal a month.\\
276 - I'll see you later.\\
277 - Are you sure?\\
278 - Even put together, these girls aren't as old\\
279 - as your ex-wife.\\
280 - Bye.\\
281 - Oh, for the love of God.\\
282 - Stop turning!\\
283 - Show's over!\\
284 - ( whispering ): Isn't he adorable?\\
285 - ALAN: Yeah.\\
286 - When's he's sleeping, he's like a little angel.\\
287 - Uh-huh.\\
288 - ( breaks wind )\\
289 - I was planning to have a glass of wine\\
290 - and sit in the hot tub before you came over.\\
291 - Oh, oh, I'm sorry.\\
292 - I just wanted to be sure he got the book.\\
293 - I'll get out of your way.\\
294 - Alan, would you like to join me?\\
295 - Oh, well, uh, I didn't bring a bathing suit.\\
296 - You don't need a bathing suit.\\
297 - Okay.\\
298 - Have you been keeping up the chlorine treatments?\\
299 - 'Cause, you know, without a bathing suit,\\
300 - you're just inviting algae into your privates.\\
301 - I like the, uh... the new patio furniture.\\
302 - Thanks.\\
303 - What is that, uh, uh, redwood?\\
304 - Teak.\\
305 - Whoa, teak.\\
306 - That must have set me back a few bucks.\\
307 - The salesman said it would pay for itself in five years.\\
308 - Oh, really? Really?\\
309 - How-how's it going to do that?\\
310 - Is it going to get a paper route?\\
311 - It's very nice.\\
312 - Thank you.\\
313 - Uh, of course, it's, uh, going to require\\
314 - a lot of upkeep.\\
315 - Um, actually, all wood that's outside\\
316 - requires upkeep...\\
317 - except trees.\\
318 - They seem to have it down.\\
319 - Alan, are you nervous?\\
320 - Yeah, a-a little.\\
321 - I mean, uh...\\
322 - we've been separated for two years.\\
323 - I haven't seen you naked for four...\\
324 - except, you know, that-that one time\\
325 - I walked in on you on the toilet, um...\\
326 - Shh...\\
327 - JAKE: Mom, you out there?\\
328 - ( whispering ): Oh, my God, what are we going to do?!\\
329 - Take a deep breath.\\
330 - What?\\
331 - I'm thirsty.\\
332 - Uh, so have something to drink.\\
333 - There's no more Goofy Juice.\\
334 - So have some water.\\
335 - Fine.\\
336 - ( gasping )\\
337 - Hey, Mom?\\
338 - What?!\\
339 - I'm hungry, too.\\
340 - Can you make me a sandwich?\\
341 - No. Have your drink and go to bed.\\
342 - Fine.\\
343 - ( gasping )\\
344 - JAKE: Mom?\\
345 - How about a cookie?\\
346 - Uh, you already brushed your teeth.\\
347 - No, I didn't.\\
348 - You said you did.\\
349 - I always say that.\\
350 - Well, then brush them and go to bed.\\
351 - Fine.\\
352 - ( gasping )\\
353 - Are you okay?\\
354 - There was a bright light, and I saw my dead grandma.\\
355 - She seemed happy.\\
356 - Here, have a little wine.\\
357 - Thank you. Thank you.\\
358 - That was close.\\
359 - Oh, relax, he... he didn't see you.\\
360 - And what if he comes back?\\
361 - Maybe I should go.\\
362 - Or we could go upstairs and get in bed.\\
363 - Bed? Our old bed?\\
364 - My new bed.\\
365 - Oh.\\
366 - What was wrong with the old one?\\
367 - Too many memories.\\
368 - Of what? You pretending to sleep\\
369 - and me watching Letterman?\\
370 - Alan, do you really want to have this conversation?\\
371 - No, I don't, but apparently\\
372 - my mouth has a mind of its own.\\
373 - Well, let's put your mouth to better use.\\
374 - I can't go back underwater, Judith.\\
375 - Hey, Charlie?\\
376 - Yeah?\\
377 - Not that it's any of my business,\\
378 - but I couldn't help noticing the matched set\\
379 - of rotating floozies on your deck earlier.\\
380 - They were for Alan.\\
381 - I was trying to get his mind off of Judith.\\
382 - With a night of meaningless, impersonal group sex?\\
383 - What a good brother.\\
384 - No, no. A good brother gets him a couple of girls.\\
385 - It takes a great brother to get him two from the same egg.\\
386 - You know...\\
387 - there is a possibility that we were wrong about this.\\
388 - Maybe Alan and Judith can work things out.\\
389 - Maybe, but if they do, what happens to Jake?\\
390 - He grows up in a happy home\\
391 - with a mommy and daddy who love each other.\\
392 - Yeah, but what about me?\\
393 - It's too late for you, Charlie.\\
394 - No, I mean, what happens to me and Jake?\\
395 - I'll never get to see him.\\
396 - Aw, you really love the little guy, huh?\\
397 - Yeah, I guess I do.\\
398 - Love hurts, Rose.\\
399 - Yes, it does.\\
400 - Especially when you've given your heart to someone\\
401 - who barely knows you exist,\\
402 - who insists on plowing through strange, stupid women\\
403 - who could never love him the way you do,\\
404 - leaving you to stand outside, alone in the night,\\
405 - wishing with all your heart that he would come to his senses\\
406 - and realize that his true happiness lies with you and no one else,\\
407 - but knowing all the while that it'll never happen\\
408 - because he's a selfish, immature, heartless jerk!\\
409 - I mean...\\
410 - poor baby.\\
411 - Okay, I'm going to stick my neck out here\\
412 - and say that was the best sex we ever had.\\
413 - I agree.\\
414 - Not that it wasn't good before...\\
415 - It wasn't.\\
416 - Okay. Granted.\\
417 - Which raises the question...\\
418 - Why is it so much better now?\\
419 - Does it matter?\\
420 - No, not-not really.\\
421 - I mean, just-just curious.\\
422 - I mean, I, uh...\\
423 - I noticed, uh, some new moves on your part,\\
424 - and I can't help wondering\\
425 - where you might have picked them up.\\
426 - Are you saying you haven't been\\
427 - with other women in the last two years?\\
428 - Oh, no, no, I-I've been with other women.\\
429 - I just didn't learn anything.\\
430 - You, on the other hand,\\
431 - have an entirely new sexual repertoire,\\
432 - including a-a couple of numbers\\
433 - I repeatedly requested when we were married.\\
434 - Alan... And by "requested," I mean "begged."\\
435 - Please don't go there.\\
436 - Oh. Now, see, that's, uh...\\
437 - that's what I'm used to hearing from you in bed.\\
438 - "Don't go there."\\
439 - "Ooh, don't touch that."\\
440 - "Leave that alone. It's not a toy."\\
441 - So I've changed.\\
442 - I would think that you would be happy.\\
443 - Well, I was... very happy,\\
444 - but then I started to think about it,\\
445 - and there's no reason you couldn't have changed with me.\\
446 - Oh, please. I mean, I gave you every chance.\\
447 - I-I bought tickets to sex seminars.\\
448 - I-I brought home books and tapes and accessories,\\
449 - and-and-and what happened?\\
450 - I sat right here reading and watching by myself\\
451 - while eating low-fat love jelly straight out of the tube.\\
452 - Okay, I can see this was a bad idea. No, no.\\
453 - The bad idea was sitting in that filthy hot tub\\
454 - without a bathing suit.\\
455 - I can feel mushrooms growing in my crack\\
456 - as we speak.\\
457 - Just go home, Alan.\\
458 - Hey, we're not married anymore.\\
459 - You can't tell me what to do.\\
460 - JAKE: Hey, Mom, does this look infected?\\
461 - Okay, bye.\\
462 - ( bushes rustling )\\
463 - It's okay. I didn't see anything.\\
464 - * Men... *\\
465 - ( door opening and closing )\\
466 - Hey.\\
467 - Hey.\\
468 - What are you watching?\\
469 - Soft-core porn.\\
470 - Sound's not on.\\
471 - I don't need to hear 'em.\\
472 - Aren't those the-the twins from the deck?\\
473 - Too late now, Alan.\\
474 - You could have been delivering that pizza.\\
475 - So, how's Judith?\\
476 - Fine. She got some new patio furniture.\\
477 - That's nice.\\
478 - Teak.\\
479 - Put in some rosebushes, too.\\
480 - How about that?\\
481 - And I think the neighbors got a new dog.\\
482 - Huh.\\
483 - A mean dog.\\
484 - Really?\\
485 - Might have been a coyote.\\
486 - Mm-hmm.\\
487 - Hard to say.\\
488 - It was dark, and I was crying.\\
489 - Anything else?\\
490 - No.\\
491 - Oh, yeah, um... I saw our dead grandmother.\\
492 - Where?\\
493 - In the hot tub.\\
494 - ( car horn honks )\\
495 - Oh, that's the cab.\\
496 - Ooh, could you, uh, lend me 60 bucks?\\
497 - Uh, I don't have my wallet on me.\\
498 - Sure.\\
499 - Oh. Thank you.\\
500 - Huh. I suddenly have a craving for pizza.
\subsection {Episode 04: Your Dismissive Attitude Toward Boobs}
1 - One, two, three, four,\\
2 - five, six, seven...\\
3 - What are you doing?\\
4 - Masticating.\\
5 - What?\\
6 - Don't worry, it doesn't mean what you think.\\
7 - And what do you think I think?\\
8 - You know...\\
9 - Okay, I know what I know.\\
10 - What do you know?\\
11 - I know that you're supposed to masticate your food\\
12 - 20 times before you swallow.\\
13 - Yeah, but, uh, what about the other thing?\\
14 - What other thing?\\
15 - The thing you thought I was thinking.\\
16 - I'm sorry, Dad. You lost me.\\
17 - Morning.\\
18 - Oh, morning.\\
19 - Isn't this your day off?\\
20 - It is, but I need to talk to Charlie.\\
21 - Well, good luck.\\
22 - He got home an hour ago,\\
23 - had a bowl of chili, threw up and went to bed.\\
24 - He probably threw up 'cause he didn't masticate enough.\\
25 - Hey, pottymouth, there's a lady present.\\
26 - Berta, why don't you tell me what you need,\\
27 - and then you can go enjoy your day off\\
28 - by spreading sunshine and cheer to others.\\
29 - It's about the house. I should wait for Charlie.\\
30 - I live here, too. What's the problem?\\
31 - I'll wait.\\
32 - Oh, for God's sake, pretend I'm Charlie.\\
33 - Talk to me.\\
34 - Okay.\\
35 - Hey, Charlie, I've thought it over,\\
36 - and if you want me to kill your brother,\\
37 - I'll need the cash up front.\\
38 - Very amusing.\\
39 - Thanks. I've been taking an improv class.\\
40 - Okay, here's the deal.\\
41 - I got five brothers and sisters.\\
42 - I'm the middle child, which probably explains\\
43 - why I'm such a people pleaser.\\
44 - Uh-huh.\\
45 - Anyhow, my brother Philip-- he's the second oldest--\\
46 - he's in the roadside fireworks business,\\
47 - which is, as you might expect, seasonal.\\
48 - Now, this creates a lot of economic uncertainty\\
49 - which has strained his marriage.\\
50 - Perhaps not as much\\
51 - as him boinking his wife's half-sister...\\
52 - ...but it's a snowball effect.\\
53 - Anyway, to make a long story short...\\
54 - Too late.\\
55 - Fair enough.\\
56 - Berta: 1; Zippy: 1.\\
57 - Anyway, Philip can't live at his house\\
58 - because, technically, it's a crime scene.\\
59 - Which is why I wanted to ask Charlie...\\
60 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
61 - You, uh, you want your brother to stay here?\\
62 - Oh, don't be stupid.\\
63 - He's staying at my place trying to wean himself\\
64 - off the meth and the codeine and whatnot.\\
65 - I want to stay here for a couple of days.\\
66 - Oh. Oh, um...\\
67 - That's okay. I'll ask Charlie.\\
68 - No, you don't have to ask Charlie.\\
69 - You-you can ask me.\\
70 - Fine.\\
71 - Oh, you'd like an answer now.\\
72 - That'd be swell.\\
73 - Ah, ah, well, uh, uh, I-I would have to say, um...\\
74 - uh, after due consideration\\
75 - and, uh, and, uh, uh, taking into account\\
76 - all the, uh, uh, factors that are-are involved that...\\
77 - It would be our pleasure to have you.\\
78 - Super. Do you mind if I take your room?\\
79 - M-M-My room? Gee, I-I...\\
80 - Trust me. You want me to have a room with a private crapper.\\
81 - Okay. By all means.\\
82 - Take my room. I'll bunk with Jake.\\
83 - Thanks.\\
84 - What do you mean, you'll bunk with Jake?\\
85 - Is that a problem?\\
86 - Yes. I need my privacy.\\
87 - For what?\\
88 - You know...\\
89 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
90 - * Men.\\
91 - Never again.\\
92 - Never, ever, ever again.\\
93 - You gonna quit drinkin'?\\
94 - Don't be ridiculous.\\
95 - I'm gonna quit wakin' up.\\
96 - What are you doing here?\\
97 - Isn't this your day off?\\
98 - It is, but your brother invited me\\
99 - to be your houseguest for a couple of days.\\
100 - Did he now?\\
101 - Well, I was going to ask you,\\
102 - but Alan said he could speak for both of you.\\
103 - Did he now?\\
104 - You got a problem with that?\\
105 - Don't be silly. You're like family.\\
106 - Yeah, well, I've seen how you treat family.\\
107 - Hey, you're always welcome here.\\
108 - You don't even have to ask.\\
109 - Morning, Alan.\\
110 - ALAN: Hey, look who finally...\\
111 - ( smacking sound ) ALAN: Ow!\\
112 - Berta? Living here?\\
113 - Are you insane?\\
114 - She needed a place to stay for a couple of days.\\
115 - What would you have said?\\
116 - I would have sat her down and explained my sincere belief\\
117 - that there are boundaries between employer and employee\\
118 - which exist specifically to protect said employer\\
119 - from accidentally seeing the employee\\
120 - prancing around in her big cotton granny-panties.\\
121 - All right. Go tell her that.\\
122 - Okay, I was bluffing.\\
123 - Look, look, it's just for a couple of days.\\
124 - We can tough it out.\\
125 - Yeah, but we wouldn't have to tough it out\\
126 - if you hadn't presumed to invite someone\\
127 - to stay at my house without my permission.\\
128 - Hey, hey, I live here, too.\\
129 - So do termites!\\
130 - They don't have guest-inviting privileges either.\\
131 - You're equating me with termites?\\
132 - Hell, no. You can get rid of termites.\\
133 - You know, if I thought you meant that,\\
134 - I would be really hurt.\\
135 - Too subtle?\\
136 - Okay, let me take another tack.\\
137 - Alan, do you know why I've never accepted\\
138 - any money from you to stay here?\\
139 - Well, I assumed you were being compassionate\\
140 - and generous during a difficult period in my life.\\
141 - Oh... ( blows raspberry )\\
142 - It's so you can be here and Jake can be here,\\
143 - but it remains my house, not our house.\\
144 - What's the difference?\\
145 - In my house, what you think,\\
146 - what you want, what you say doesn't mean squat.\\
147 - It's just jibber-jabber.\\
148 - So... so you're saying I have no rights here?\\
149 - I thought that was understood.\\
150 - I can't believe we're even talking about it.\\
151 - Incredible!\\
152 - I've been living here for two years,\\
153 - and you still consider me a houseguest. No.\\
154 - My houseguests bring a bottle of wine and have sex with me.\\
155 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
156 - I'll go get some chardonnay and assume the position.\\
157 - Hey, don't be letting your mouth write checks\\
158 - your ass can't cash.\\
159 - ( under breath ): Pompous jerk.\\
160 - I don't know how you put up with that.\\
161 - Y-Y-You heard?\\
162 - Uh, we were whispering.\\
163 - Must be one of them acoustical anomalies.\\
164 - I just think it's criminal the way Charlie treats you--\\
165 - like some kind of second-class citizen.\\
166 - Second-class?\\
167 - I aspire to second-class.\\
168 - You know what the pecking order is in this house?\\
169 - Charlie, women Charlie sleeps with,\\
170 - Charlie's bookie, women Charlie hopes to sleep with,\\
171 - termites, me.\\
172 - Well, that's just not right.\\
173 - Yeah, but what am I supposed to do?\\
174 - I-I-I can't really afford my own place.\\
175 - I mean, I could, but it certainly wouldn't be on the beach...\\
176 - unless the beach was Guadalcanal.\\
177 - It's a shame, you paying all that money for an ex-wife\\
178 - and an ex-wife's house,\\
179 - and you're not allowed inside either one.\\
180 - Exactly.\\
181 - I'm a victim here.\\
182 - Oh, yeah. You got "victim" written all over you.\\
183 - But does my brother sympathize?\\
184 - Do Catholic priests make good baby-sitters?\\
185 - Listen, you want rights and privileges,\\
186 - you got to demand them.\\
187 - Stand up to Charlie. Get in his face.\\
188 - You know what?\\
189 - You're right.\\
190 - And starting now.\\
191 - Go get him, tiger.\\
192 - Come here, Charlie.\\
193 - I want to...\\
194 - ( slap ) ALAN: Ow!\\
195 - * Men.\\
196 - Oh, that is so wrong.\\
197 - Hey.\\
198 - Hey. You know, Charlie,\\
199 - you've really got a beautiful view here.\\
200 - You're just noticing that?\\
201 - Well, I spend most of my days looking at dirty toilets\\
202 - and those Rorschach tests you call bedsheets.\\
203 - Oh. Well, it's nice you're getting a chance\\
204 - to stop and smell the roses.\\
205 - Oh, don't get me started on the smells around here.\\
206 - Hey, listen, Berta, you know,\\
207 - you know how I feel about you, right?\\
208 - No, tell me.\\
209 - Oh, gee, I could never put it into words.\\
210 - Well... then show me.\\
211 - Relax, I'm just screwin' with you.\\
212 - ( chuckling )\\
213 - Good one.\\
214 - Anyway, uh...\\
215 - I believe there are certain boundaries\\
216 - between an employer and an employee...\\
217 - which is why I think it'd be best if you found...\\
218 - Oh, I agree with you about the boundaries...\\
219 - ...which is why I've been keeping quiet\\
220 - about the things your brother says behind your back.\\
221 - What does he say?\\
222 - Oh, I don't want to cause problems.\\
223 - No, no, no, come on, tell me.\\
224 - Well, let's just say that he doesn't always appreciate\\
225 - everything you do for him.\\
226 - You know what the problem is?\\
227 - I'm a soft touch.\\
228 - You do have a big heart,\\
229 - and there are always people out there\\
230 - who will take advantage of that.\\
231 - You just wouldn't think it'd be your own brother.\\
232 - Yeah, that's the saddest part.\\
233 - But what can I do about it?\\
234 - Respect's not freely given in this life, Charlie.\\
235 - You got to demand it.\\
236 - You're right. It's time for me to stand up for myself.\\
237 - Good for you.\\
238 - And while you're up,\\
239 - would you get me one of those little Japanese beers\\
240 - you keep in the refrigerator?\\
241 - Oh, sure. Be right back.\\
242 - Thanks.\\
243 - I'm a baaad pussycat.\\
244 - * Men.\\
245 - Did you know\\
246 - your body doesn't digest corn?\\
247 - It goes out the same way it comes in.\\
248 - It's like a little bookmark in your poop.\\
249 - Did they teach you that in school?\\
250 - Nope. It's the powers of observation.\\
251 - ALAN: Jake,\\
252 - that's not dinner conversation.\\
253 - You're right.\\
254 - It's dinner cornversation.\\
255 - See what happens when you don't hit your kids.\\
256 - Hey, something smells good.\\
257 - Meat loaf.\\
258 - Great, I love meat loaf.\\
259 - Well, you should make some.\\
260 - I'll give you the recipe.\\
261 - You didn't make enough for me?\\
262 - I'm not your chef.\\
263 - Is that so?\\
264 - How did you cook the meat loaf?\\
265 - In the oven. Aha.\\
266 - My oven.\\
267 - What's your point?\\
268 - My point?\\
269 - Uh...\\
270 - Oh, don't put me in the middle.\\
271 - I love you both.\\
272 - My point is, I'm hungry, and I want meat loaf.\\
273 - Yeah, well, I'm Alan, and I want respect.\\
274 - I think I got a better chance at gettin' meat loaf.\\
275 - You know what, Charlie?\\
276 - I'm starting to feel like maybe\\
277 - Jake and I have overstayed our welcome.\\
278 - No, not at all. Jake's still welcome.\\
279 - You're the one with the attitude.\\
280 - My attitude?\\
281 - I-I thought my attitude didn't count for anything.\\
282 - That it was just... jabberwocky.\\
283 - Jibber-jabber, you moron.\\
284 - Okay, okay, that settles it.\\
285 - I think it's time we moved.\\
286 - We?\\
287 - Yeah, we.\\
288 - But I'm still welcome.\\
289 - You'll go where I go.\\
290 - Can we get a place on the beach?\\
291 - Sure, if you don't mind living under a lifeguard stand.\\
292 - Hey, we managed to get by without your help\\
293 - before we came here, we'll do it again.\\
294 - Why do you keep saying "we"?\\
295 - You know what your problem is?\\
296 - You just don't appreciate all the things I do for you.\\
297 - Yeah, well, I'm tired of being treated\\
298 - like a second-class citizen.\\
299 - Fine. You want to leave, leave.\\
300 - Maybe I will.\\
301 - Way to stand up for yourself.\\
302 - Thank you.\\
303 - So, are we really out of meat loaf,\\
304 - or were you just saying that to piss him off?\\
305 - * Men.\\
306 - Oh, this looks interesting.\\
307 - "Two-bedroom. Needs work.\\
308 - Up-and-coming neighborhood."\\
309 - What-What does that mean, uh, "Up-and-coming neighborhood?"\\
310 - It means the Realtor didn't think\\
311 - he could move the house saying, "Drug-ravaged battlefield."\\
312 - Okay, we'll keep looking.\\
313 - Alan, I don't mean to pry, but after alimony and child support,\\
314 - exactly how much can you afford to spend?\\
315 - Really?\\
316 - Yes, really.\\
317 - Sweetie, my shoes cost more than this.\\
318 - Well, Mom, you have a lot of shoes.\\
319 - The ones I'm wearing.\\
320 - Alan, based on this amount, you don't need a Realtor.\\
321 - You need someone who sells camping equipment.\\
322 - Yeah, well, then that's what I'll do.\\
323 - All right, but may I propose a simple alternative?\\
324 - I'm not living with you, Mom.\\
325 - Okay.\\
326 - Well, then I have a final alternative.\\
327 - And what would that be?\\
328 - Run straight to your brother's ass,\\
329 - and kiss it repeatedly.\\
330 - Forget it.\\
331 - I-I can't stay here anymore.\\
332 - Hey, Red, you want to top this off for me?\\
333 - Certainly.\\
334 - May I get you a short stack\\
335 - and some pork links while I'm at it?\\
336 - Nah, I'm full.\\
337 - But as long as we're discussing dining choices,\\
338 - why don't you bite me?\\
339 - Oh, goodie.\\
340 - More loved ones.\\
341 - Good morning, Charlie.\\
342 - Let me guess.\\
343 - Alan invited you to move in.\\
344 - No. She's helping me move out.\\
345 - This is a sad day.\\
346 - We're gonna miss you around here, Alan.\\
347 - Well, thank you, Berta.\\
348 - Sad, sad, sad.\\
349 - Don't you have anything to say, Charlie?\\
350 - Yeah.\\
351 - Boo-hoo.\\
352 - Okay, well, enough of sentiment.\\
353 - We should really get going.\\
354 - Apartments in your price range are a long drive from Malibu.\\
355 - I know, Mom.\\
356 - A long, long drive.\\
357 - Got it.\\
358 - Maybe you should try to go pee-pee\\
359 - before we get in the car.\\
360 - Okay!\\
361 - Would you mind looking after Jake?\\
362 - If it'll help get you out of here, I'll breast-feed him.\\
363 - You know, with Zippy out of here,\\
364 - you're gonna have that nice guest room just going to waste.\\
365 - Yeah?\\
366 - So, I was thinking, how about if I become a live-in?\\
367 - A live-in what?\\
368 - Housekeeper.\\
369 - Easier for you, easier for me.\\
370 - Everybody wins.\\
371 - Gee, um...\\
372 - Hold that thought. My coffee just kicked in.\\
373 - ( knocking )\\
374 - Hey, you want to go down to the arcade and play some air hockey?\\
375 - No.\\
376 - Want to go to a movie?\\
377 - No.\\
378 - Come on, I'll take you to something R-rated.\\
379 - See some boobs.\\
380 - Just leave me alone.\\
381 - Are you mad at me?\\
382 - What was your first clue?\\
383 - Well, frankly, your dismissive attitude toward boobs.\\
384 - Why are you making us move?\\
385 - You're not moving.\\
386 - Well, then why is Dad looking\\
387 - for another place for us to live?\\
388 - Because he's trying to teach me a lesson.\\
389 - Why don't you tell him to stop?\\
390 - Because I'm trying to teach him a lesson.\\
391 - What's your lesson?\\
392 - That it's my house.\\
393 - What's his lesson?\\
394 - That he lives here, too.\\
395 - Okay, I'm just a kid,\\
396 - but that sounds stupid even to me.\\
397 - Well, be that as it may, I give you my word,\\
398 - I am not gonna let you go anywhere.\\
399 - Promise?\\
400 - Promise.\\
401 - Is the boob offer still open?\\
402 - Come on.\\
403 - * Men.\\
404 - How do you pronounce her last name?\\
405 - Hayek. Salma Hayek.\\
406 - Wow. Her name's as pretty as her boobs.\\
407 - Hey.\\
408 - Hey.\\
409 - What's all this?\\
410 - Found a place.\\
411 - Fully furnished, ready to move in.\\
412 - Uh, Jake, I packed most of your stuff.\\
413 - You may want to check if I missed anything.\\
414 - Uncle Charlie...?\\
415 - Listen to your father.\\
416 - But you said...\\
417 - I said listen to your father.\\
418 - ( sighs )\\
419 - I'm just a pawn.\\
420 - So, where is this place?\\
421 - In the Valley.\\
422 - A lovely, uh, Spanish-style complex called\\
423 - Valley Hacienda.\\
424 - Good for you.\\
425 - Two-bedroom.\\
426 - Pool, Jacuzzi, rec room.\\
427 - Sounds great.\\
428 - It is, and we're going.\\
429 - I can see that.\\
430 - Well, it's for the best.\\
431 - I'll finally have a place that's really mine,\\
432 - and you can go back to living the selfish,\\
433 - unexamined life you obviously cherish.\\
434 - Looking forward to it.\\
435 - Okay, I guess I'm ready to go.\\
436 - Well, then, uh, I guess we should go.\\
437 - Need some help?\\
438 - No, we can handle it.\\
439 - All right, uh, Valley Hacienda, here we come.\\
440 - Jake, say good-bye to your Uncle Charlie.\\
441 - Bye, Uncle Charlie.\\
442 - Bye, kid.\\
443 - Jake, go get in the car.\\
444 - Listen to your father.\\
445 - I don't think anybody's learning anything here.\\
446 - Well, uh, thanks for your hospitality.\\
447 - I'm sorry we overstayed our welcome.\\
448 - Alan...\\
449 - I don't want to go.\\
450 - Please don't make me go.\\
451 - I love it here.\\
452 - I love it so much!\\
453 - I thought you found a nice place.\\
454 - I was bluffing. It sucked!\\
455 - They all sucked!\\
456 - Do you want me to kiss your ass?\\
457 - 'Cause I will literally kiss your ass!\\
458 - Come on. Turn around.\\
459 - Alan, cut it out.\\
460 - I mean it, I mean it. You're the boss.\\
461 - You know, I'd-I'd rather be a second-class citizen\\
462 - here in paradise than king of a urine-soaked firetrap\\
463 - next to Burbank Airport.\\
464 - Alan, Alan, calm down, calm down.\\
465 - If you want to stay, you can stay.\\
466 - Thank you, thank you, thank you.\\
467 - Thank you. Oh, Charlie, you have no idea how bad it was.\\
468 - I mean, I couldn't bring a woman to one of these places.\\
469 - The only way I'd ever have sex was if I was molested by a rat.\\
470 - Pull yourself together.\\
471 - ( sniffling )\\
472 - Now go grab Jake, and we'll all have some dinner.\\
473 - Okay, okay.\\
474 - And-And thanks again.\\
475 - You're welcome.\\
476 - ( sniffling )\\
477 - Hey, hey, Charlie?\\
478 - What?\\
479 - Just before\\
480 - I-I went down on my knees...\\
481 - were you about to say something?\\
482 - I don't think so.\\
483 - Before I started weeping,\\
484 - you were gonna tell me to stay.\\
485 - No, I wasn't.\\
486 - Okay, you're not fooling anybody.\\
487 - You'd miss me if I was gone.\\
488 - Despite\\
489 - everything you've said, we're brothers,\\
490 - and we have a bond that's deeper\\
491 - and more meaningful than any...\\
492 - He folded, didn't he?\\
493 - My ass is covered with lip-prints.\\
494 - Damn.\\
495 - Well, anyway, uh,\\
496 - I guess you want to head home and see how Philip's doing.\\
497 - Who?\\
498 - Philip?\\
499 - Your brother?\\
500 - Detoxing?\\
501 - Oh, yeah, sure.\\
502 - Philip.\\
503 - My brother.\\
504 - This isn't so bad.\\
505 - Seems reasonably safe.\\
506 - Oh, yeah.\\
507 - I'm sure the Valley Hacienda crack dealers have organized\\
508 - some sort of neighborhood watch.\\
509 - We could make this work.\\
510 - I-I think\\
511 - it's got a lot going for it.\\
512 - ( jet engine roaring loudly )\\
513 - I'm not a big fan of the orange carpet,\\
514 - um, but part of the fun\\
515 - of having a new place is fixing it up,\\
516 - making it your own.\\
517 - ( jet engine roaring ) You know, slap on a new coat of paint...\\
518 - ( roaring continues )\\
519 - ...some fresh linoleum on the kitchen floor.\\
520 - Of course, a little bleach\\
521 - to take out those bloodstains in the tub.\\
522 - Or you could just run home\\
523 - and kiss your brother's ass repeatedly.\\
524 - Couldn't you just say, "I told you so?"
\subsection {Episode 05: We Called It Mr. Pinky}
1 - Why do you have to leave?\\
2 - Charlie, I have to get home.\\
3 - I have to feed my cat.\\
4 - I have to feed my fish.\\
5 - We've been in bed for three days.\\
6 - I'm guessing the cat's fed\\
7 - and what's left of the fish is in the kitty litter.\\
8 - Well, I also have a job.\\
9 - Call in sick.\\
10 - I did it yesterday.\\
11 - Okay, call in horny.\\
12 - I'll write you a note.\\
13 - I wish I could.\\
14 - I love being with you.\\
15 - Me, too.\\
16 - And having you here just makes it all the better.\\
17 - You know, we've been seeing each other for over two months now,\\
18 - and you've never spent the night at my place.\\
19 - Okay, well, go clean up the dead animals\\
20 - and I'll come over tonight.\\
21 - Deal.\\
22 - I'll cook you dinner.\\
23 - Great.\\
24 - I think I love you, Charlie Harper.\\
25 - Thank you.\\
26 - I'll see you later.\\
27 - Wait a minute.\\
28 - Did you just say "thank you"?\\
29 - Did I?\\
30 - Yes, I said "I think I love you," and you said "thank you."\\
31 - What's that supposed to mean?\\
32 - Thank you?\\
33 - It's an expression of appreciation.\\
34 - Thank you.\\
35 - That's it?\\
36 - You don't have anything to add?\\
37 - Thank you...\\
38 - so very much.\\
39 - Great, that's-that's great.\\
40 - I open my heart to you and you couldn't care less.\\
41 - Well, that's not fair.\\
42 - I could care less, a lot less.\\
43 - Oh, come on,\\
44 - what do you want me to do? Lie to you?\\
45 - No, I want you to drop dead,\\
46 - you smug, cold-hearted son of a bitch.\\
47 - Phew, that could have been ugly.\\
48 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
49 - * Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...\\
50 - Hey, guess what happened at school today.\\
51 - You made the honor roll.\\
52 - What's that?\\
53 - Forget it.\\
54 - What happened at school?\\
55 - Well, there's this girl.\\
56 - Okay, now I'm listening.\\
57 - Her name is Robin Newberry.\\
58 - Name's not important, proceed.\\
59 - She gave me a cupcake.\\
60 - Yeah, so?\\
61 - I think she likes me.\\
62 - So what's the problem?\\
63 - Now I think she thinks I like her back.\\
64 - Do you?\\
65 - I didn't think I did, but it was a really good cupcake.\\
66 - Wow.\\
67 - What a perfect metaphor.\\
68 - No, it was a cupcake.\\
69 - Okay, blank slate, have a seat.\\
70 - I'm going to tell you something\\
71 - that will serve you well for your entire life.\\
72 - Like when you're peeing outside always face down wind?\\
73 - Better.\\
74 - By the way, what the hell were you thinking?\\
75 - I was thinking "Boy, I hope that's really warm rain."\\
76 - Okay.\\
77 - Let's focus on today's lesson.\\
78 - Never ever confuse cupcakes with love.\\
79 - But I love cupcakes.\\
80 - We all love cupcakes.\\
81 - That doesn't mean you have to love the baker.\\
82 - Her mom baked it.\\
83 - You're missing the point.\\
84 - Robin just helped with the icing.\\
85 - Okay, okay.\\
86 - She made a smiley face with Red Hots.\\
87 - I get it.\\
88 - I'm just saying that when someone freely gives you her cupcake,\\
89 - your only obligation is to enjoy it.\\
90 - There's no reason to get emotionally involved.\\
91 - Why not? Because, if you do, the next thing you know,\\
92 - you'll be stuck eating the same damn cupcake\\
93 - for the rest of your life.\\
94 - But it was a really good cupcake.\\
95 - I can't stop thinking about it.\\
96 - Yeah. I've had cupcakes like that.\\
97 - But the thing you've got to remember is,\\
98 - there'll always be other cupcakes.\\
99 - And if the day should come\\
100 - when you find yourself in a cupcake drought--\\
101 - and those days come, don't kid yourself--\\
102 - well, then you just shell out a couple of bucks\\
103 - for a nice Ho-Ho.\\
104 - Understand?\\
105 - I think so. Thanks, Uncle Charlie.\\
106 - No problem.\\
107 - Hey, what are you guys talking about?\\
108 - Sex.\\
109 - Well, how about that?\\
110 - The booger-eater grasped the symbolism.\\
111 - You were talking to my son about sex?\\
112 - He came to me with a cupcake problem.\\
113 - I thought it was about sex.\\
114 - I was using cupcakes as a metaphor.\\
115 - Jeez, the kid got it.\\
116 - Okay, walk me through the metaphor.\\
117 - Some little girl gave him a cupcake.\\
118 - Okay, okay, stop.\\
119 - Gave him a cupcake?\\
120 - Are we talking baked goods\\
121 - or are we talking some new hip-hop slang?\\
122 - Baked goods.\\
123 - I told him it was okay to enjoy the cupcake,\\
124 - without feeling emotionally obligated to the girl.\\
125 - So in essence, you just told my son\\
126 - it's okay to have sex with a girl\\
127 - without having any feelings towards her?\\
128 - Lucky for us he asks me stuff I know about.\\
129 - There's no "us" here.\\
130 - There's no "lucky."\\
131 - That's a terrible lesson.\\
132 - Hey, I could have done 20 minutes\\
133 - just on licking the icing.\\
134 - But I took the high road.\\
135 - Okay, okay, enough.\\
136 - Here's the deal.\\
137 - From now on,\\
138 - all cupcake conversations will be referred to me.\\
139 - Why?\\
140 - You don't know the difference between a Ding Dong\\
141 - and your elbow.\\
142 - Nevertheless, I do not want him learning about relationships\\
143 - from a misogynist.\\
144 - A misogynist?\\
145 - You're saying I'm a misogynist?\\
146 - Yes, Charlie, you are a misogynist.\\
147 - I'm a misogynist. Mm-hmm.\\
148 - I'm a misogynist.\\
149 - That is really low, Alan,\\
150 - calling your own brother a misogynist.\\
151 - G-I-N or G-E-N?\\
152 - G-Y-N.\\
153 - Thanks.\\
154 - I do not hate women.\\
155 - Oh, come on, Charlie.\\
156 - If anything, I am the opposite of a misogynist.\\
157 - I'm a... pro-sogynist.\\
158 - I love women.\\
159 - Oh, is that so?\\
160 - Even if there's no possibility of having sex with them?\\
161 - What?\\
162 - Exactly.\\
163 - And it is precisely that attitude\\
164 - that I do not want my son to grow up with.\\
165 - Okay, okay.\\
166 - Hold it just a second.\\
167 - So you'd rather he grow up to be like you?\\
168 - Scared of women, manipulated by women?\\
169 - That's not true.\\
170 - Oh, please, look at your ex-wife.\\
171 - Say what you want about me,\\
172 - but at least I've never chosen\\
173 - to have women in my life who do nothing but mistreat me.\\
174 - BERTA: Hey, stud!\\
175 - I don't know what kind of sick, twisted party\\
176 - you had in your bedroom the last couple of days,\\
177 - but I sure as hell ain't cleaning it up.\\
178 - That is different, way different.\\
179 - * Men\\
180 - Hey, Dad, what time is it?\\
181 - Uh, 20 after 6:00, why?\\
182 - 'Cause I have to call my girlfriend at 6:30.\\
183 - Um, w-what girlfriend?\\
184 - Robin Newberry.\\
185 - Cupcake Robin Newberry?\\
186 - Charlie, stay out of it.\\
187 - How can I stay out of it?\\
188 - If I saw a bus heading for him,\\
189 - would I not throw myself in front of it to save him?\\
190 - Would you? I'm just making a point here.\\
191 - Charlie, if you don't mind, I'll handle it.\\
192 - Jake, I thought we talked about this.\\
193 - Yeah, you said I shouldn't take a cupcake from a girl\\
194 - if I don't like her.\\
195 - That's right.\\
196 - So I decided to like her.\\
197 - We're exclusive.\\
198 - Exclusive?\\
199 - That means I don't talk to other girls\\
200 - and I get a cupcake every day.\\
201 - I better call now.\\
202 - If I'm late, she yells at me.\\
203 - Congratulations, Alan.\\
204 - You're son is officially pastry-whipped.\\
205 - ROSE: Marco!\\
206 - Not now, Rose.\\
207 - Marco!\\
208 - Rose, I'm not in the mood.\\
209 - Marco!\\
210 - Polo.\\
211 - Hey, Charlie.\\
212 - Hey.\\
213 - Is something wrong?\\
214 - I'm not sure.\\
215 - Rose, do you think I'm a misogynist?\\
216 - Oh, wow, yeah.\\
217 - Did somebody say you weren't?\\
218 - Marco!\\
219 - How can I be a misogynist?\\
220 - My whole life is a testament to my love for women.\\
221 - Oh, it's sweet that you think that.\\
222 - But what you call love\\
223 - is really just an obsession to control and dominate\\
224 - based on mistrust and hostility.\\
225 - Yeah, so?\\
226 - You forget I spent the night with you once.\\
227 - You don't make love to a woman.\\
228 - You overpower her.\\
229 - You subjugate her.\\
230 - You... ravage her.\\
231 - Anywho, it's obvious you're still trying\\
232 - to resolve long-standing Oedipal issues.\\
233 - Hold on.\\
234 - O-E-D...\\
235 - You sure?\\
236 - Yeah, I have a masters in psychology\\
237 - and I know how to spell.\\
238 - ( mimicking Rose ): I have a masters in psychology and I know how to spell.\\
239 - Here it is, Oedipus complex.\\
240 - Okay, that's what I thought.\\
241 - That's just sick.\\
242 - Unconscious, unresolved sexual feeling towards my mother?\\
243 - I didn't write the dictionary, Charlie.\\
244 - But it's not true.\\
245 - I despise my mother.\\
246 - Consciously, yes.\\
247 - And that's why you conflate sex and aggression.\\
248 - It's textbook misogyny.\\
249 - "Conflate"?\\
250 - Come on, what is it, fancy word day?\\
251 - It means to join together.\\
252 - Thank you.\\
253 - So what are you saying?\\
254 - You will never be able to have\\
255 - a trusting and truly loving relationship with any woman,\\
256 - until you resolve your feelings about your mother.\\
257 - Ah... broads have been telling me that for years.\\
258 - It's a lot of hooey.\\
259 - It's okay, Charlie.\\
260 - The world is filled with women who seek out misogynists.\\
261 - Women who need men to mistreat them\\
262 - and provide them with angry, aggressive sex\\
263 - in order to satisfy their own twisted pathology.\\
264 - I see.\\
265 - Well, I guess I'll just have to look for a woman like that.\\
266 - Marco!\\
267 - * Men\\
268 - Thanks for giving me another chance.\\
269 - You were so darling on the phone, I couldn't resist.\\
270 - Look, I know I know I've got some intimacy issues,\\
271 - but I'm working on them.\\
272 - And if you could just be patient with me,\\
273 - I think you and I could truly... conflate.\\
274 - What's conflate mean?\\
275 - ( screaming )\\
276 - Look, you don't have to go.\\
277 - Relax, Charlie.\\
278 - All men have performance problems occasionally.\\
279 - No, no, no, no, it's not officially\\
280 - a performance problem until we give up.\\
281 - Right now it's just unusually long foreplay.\\
282 - I'm sorry, but I have to get back to work.\\
283 - Damn, my carpal tunnel's acting up.\\
284 - How about if I come with you?\\
285 - We can give it a shot in your car.\\
286 - It's okay. I still love you.\\
287 - Thank you.\\
288 - I mean, I really appreciate your understanding\\
289 - and support during this dark time.\\
290 - I'll call you.\\
291 - What?\\
292 - Nothing.\\
293 - Go ahead, say it.\\
294 - I, uh, I have nothing to say.\\
295 - Except, you know...\\
296 - ha-ha.\\
297 - Oh, my.\\
298 - Don't tell me I got a rise out of you.\\
299 - Alan, I am right on the edge.\\
300 - Be very careful.\\
301 - Sorry.\\
302 - I didn't realize it was so impotent.\\
303 - You forget one thing.\\
304 - Oh, what's that?\\
305 - I can still run.\\
306 - * Men\\
307 - ( doorbell rings )\\
308 - EVELYN ( over speaker ): Yes?\\
309 - Mom, it's me, Charlie.\\
310 - I-I'm a little busy right now.\\
311 - What do you want? We need to talk.\\
312 - About what?\\
313 - About how I'll never be able to have a meaningful relationship\\
314 - with a woman because of the way you screwed me up!\\
315 - Oh.\\
316 - Well...\\
317 - sorry about that.\\
318 - Let me in!\\
319 - There's more?\\
320 - Yes!\\
321 - ( long sigh )\\
322 - Will this having children thing never end?\\
323 - ( door buzzes ) Mom!\\
324 - Look, I'm sorry this is such a major inconvenience for you...\\
325 - Oh, God!\\
326 - What are you doing?\\
327 - Downward Facing Dog.\\
328 - What?\\
329 - It's yoga, Charlie.\\
330 - Oh.\\
331 - Well, could your dog possibly face upward while we talk?\\
332 - Fine.\\
333 - Aw, geez!\\
334 - What the hell is the mutt doing now?\\
335 - Charlie, just say what you came to say.\\
336 - Okay, well, are you aware that I'm a misogynist?\\
337 - Really?\\
338 - I raised you Episcopalian.\\
339 - This isn't funny.\\
340 - My anger and mistrust towards women starts with you.\\
341 - Which wasn't a problem until it spilled over into my sex life.\\
342 - So you're blaming mummy\\
343 - because little Charlie can't come out and play?\\
344 - Okay, first of all, we don't call it "little Charlie."\\
345 - What do we call it, darling?\\
346 - We don't call it anything!\\
347 - Well, when you were a baby, we called it Mr. Pinky.\\
348 - I may never have sex again.\\
349 - Wait a sec.\\
350 - Mr. Pinky was the cat.\\
351 - What did we call your penis?\\
352 - It doesn't matter.\\
353 - The point is, it isn't working anymore.\\
354 - And somehow it's all tied up in some sick twisted knot with you.\\
355 - Mr. Peepee!\\
356 - Well, you can see why I confused that with Mr. Pinky.\\
357 - Mom, I learned about relationships\\
358 - from watching you.\\
359 - And you know what toxic little lessons I learned?\\
360 - Tell me, sweetheart.\\
361 - I learned that men who get emotionally involved\\
362 - get stepped on.\\
363 - I learned that men who get married get emasculated.\\
364 - I learned that the best way to not get your heart broken\\
365 - is to pretend you don't have one.\\
366 - You learned all that from me? Yes.\\
367 - Darling, I've never been more proud\\
368 - of you than I am at this moment.\\
369 - You're joking, right?\\
370 - Not at all.\\
371 - For the first time, I look at you and I see myself.\\
372 - Oh, that's just insane.\\
373 - ( screaming )\\
374 - * Men\\
375 - Save room for dessert. I bought brownies.\\
376 - No, thanks.\\
377 - Brownies just remind me of cupcakes.\\
378 - His, uh, his little girlfriend dumped him.\\
379 - Really?\\
380 - She said she needed her space.\\
381 - I'm sorry, buddy.\\
382 - Want some advice?\\
383 - Yeah.\\
384 - What do I do, Uncle Charlie?\\
385 - I meant from me.\\
386 - Oh. No, thank you.\\
387 - Well?\\
388 - Might as well listen to your dad, 'cause...\\
389 - I got nothing.\\
390 - Less than him?\\
391 - Fellas, I am the sick puppy of a downward dog.\\
392 - The only thing I'm good for is drinking out of a toilet\\
393 - and sniffing my own ass.\\
394 - Which, by the way, I saw our mother do earlier.\\
395 - ( sighs ): Okay, what do you think?\\
396 - Marco. Oh, geez!\\
397 - Don't do that.\\
398 - Sorry.\\
399 - Are you okay?\\
400 - Oh, sure.\\
401 - Everything I believed in is wrong.\\
402 - Everything I thought I was, I'm not.\\
403 - And Mr. Peepee's on the fritz.\\
404 - Mr. Peepee?\\
405 - Yeah, that's what my mother used to call...\\
406 - Oh, don't make me explain this, Rose.\\
407 - Okay. But he's on the fritz, you say?\\
408 - Yes.\\
409 - Well, I'm not surprised.\\
410 - The depth of your pathology, coupled with the intensity\\
411 - of your denial, was bound to manifest itself\\
412 - physically, sooner or later.\\
413 - In plain, simple English, Rose.\\
414 - When your mind gets crazy,\\
415 - Mr. Peepee gets lazy.\\
416 - Let me put it another way.\\
417 - When your psyche gets iffy,\\
418 - you can't get a stiffy.\\
419 - Stop it. Stop it.\\
420 - Just tell me how I can fix it.\\
421 - Well, there's no quick fix when it comes to limp...\\
422 - Rose!\\
423 - No more rhymes.\\
424 - Are you sure? I got a beauty with "toner."\\
425 - Okay. Well,\\
426 - traditional therapy can help,\\
427 - but you'll have to commit to a long, arduous process\\
428 - of self-exploration over a period of years.\\
429 - Years?\\
430 - I can't go years without...\\
431 - Mr. Peepee.\\
432 - Charlie, isn't your long-term mental and emotional health\\
433 - more important than a few fleeting orgasms?\\
434 - It's not even more important than one.\\
435 - Okay, well, in that case,\\
436 - I suppose we could try a shortcut like hypnotherapy.\\
437 - You know how to do that?\\
438 - I studied it.\\
439 - But for it to work, you'd have to trust me completely.\\
440 - You know, Rose, as strange as it may seem,\\
441 - out of all the women I know,\\
442 - you're the only one I trust at all.\\
443 - Wow. Personally I find that very flattering,\\
444 - while professionally, it's deeply disturbing.\\
445 - So just relax,\\
446 - sit back, close your eyes,\\
447 - and listen only to the sound of my voice.\\
448 - I just want to get my mother out of my head, okay?\\
449 - I don't want to quit drinking or gambling\\
450 - or any of the good stuff.\\
451 - All right.\\
452 - Okay. So just relax.\\
453 - ( chuckles ): Oh, my.\\
454 - I see everything's back to normal.\\
455 - Better than normal.\\
456 - Did you take one of those pills?\\
457 - No, I don't need any pills; it's all me.\\
458 - And nobody else.\\
459 - Now, why don't you just relax while I introduce you\\
460 - to the new, improved Charlie.\\
461 - ( phone ringing )\\
462 - ( clucking like a chicken )\\
463 - ( continues clucking )\\
464 - Who were you calling?\\
465 - I was just ordering a little chicken.\\
466 - * Men\\
467 - What smells so good?\\
468 - Your kid's in the kitchen baking.\\
469 - You're kidding.\\
470 - Hey, dad, want a cupcake?\\
471 - Um, sure.\\
472 - Uncle Charlie?\\
473 - Thank you. Have as many as you want.\\
474 - I got another batch in the oven.\\
475 - It's, uh, it's very tasty.\\
476 - What, uh, what prompted this?\\
477 - I figured out I don't need a girlfriend.\\
478 - If I want a cupcake, I just make it myself.\\
479 - Taking matters into his own hands.\\
480 - The metaphor is now complete.\\
481 - Anybody want to lick the beater?\\
482 - No. No.\\
483 - ( oven timer dings )\\
484 - ( clucking like a chicken )\\
485 - What?
\subsection {Episode 06: Hi, Mr. Horned One}
1 - That's a cool snake tattoo on your back.\\
2 - Thanks.\\
3 - It's Anacoth, the demon who eats human souls.\\
4 - My friend Jeffrey has a dog that eats his own poop.\\
5 - He tries to lick our face, but we don't let him.\\
6 - Okay.\\
7 - Who's that one?\\
8 - That's the Goddess of the Damned--\\
9 - she whose name cannot be spoken.\\
10 - Why, is it hard to pronounce?\\
11 - What?\\
12 - We have a friend at school like that.\\
13 - He's from India.\\
14 - We just call him Rusty.\\
15 - No kidding.\\
16 - Does it hurt to get tattoos?\\
17 - Yeah, but it's worth it, you know?\\
18 - Sure.\\
19 - Once I bit my tongue really hard eating a frozen Milky Way,\\
20 - but it was totally worth it.\\
21 - Good morning.\\
22 - Hey, Dad.\\
23 - Hey.\\
24 - Hi, I'm Alan, Jake's dad.\\
25 - Isabella.\\
26 - She's a friend of Uncle Charlie's.\\
27 - I would hope so.\\
28 - Yeah, and she was showing me her tattoos.\\
29 - Oh, lucky you.\\
30 - There was a time when you had to pay a quarter\\
31 - and go into a tent to see that.\\
32 - Now, it's right at your breakfast table.\\
33 - Uh, go get dressed.\\
34 - I want to see the rest of her tattoos.\\
35 - Go.\\
36 - I have a quarter.\\
37 - Jake.\\
38 - ( sighs ) All right.\\
39 - Um...\\
40 - Isabella, I hate to be a fuddy-duddy,\\
41 - but we try to keep the house smoke-free.\\
42 - I'm sorry.\\
43 - Charlie didn't say anything when I was smoking in bed last night.\\
44 - Yeah, well, Charlie's lungs aren't always\\
45 - on the same page as his penis.\\
46 - Morning, baby.\\
47 - Hey.\\
48 - ( clears throat )\\
49 - If you don't like it, don't watch.\\
50 - ( moans )\\
51 - I'm gonna go upstairs and take a shower.\\
52 - You want to join me?\\
53 - Sure. Just let me get some fluids in me,\\
54 - so I got something to work with.\\
55 - Hurry.\\
56 - Anacoth is hungry.\\
57 - "Anacoth is hungry"?\\
58 - She's referring to her snake tattoo.\\
59 - Oh.\\
60 - Her vagina's called Linda.\\
61 - Pretty name.\\
62 - Uh, listen, I don't want to overstep my bounds.\\
63 - This is your house and you're free to bring into it\\
64 - whoever or... whatever you choose.\\
65 - But I-I do think that I have the right to protect Jake\\
66 - from being exposed to certain people.\\
67 - Then you better take him to a hotel for a couple days,\\
68 - 'cause that girl ain't leaving till one of us is dead.\\
69 - Come on, Charlie.\\
70 - No, no, no, you come on.\\
71 - You see a little body ink and a cigarette\\
72 - and you immediately condemn her, but let me tell you something.\\
73 - She's smart, she's got a great sense of humor, and in bed,\\
74 - she moves like one of those paint shakers\\
75 - at Sherwin Williams.\\
76 - Nevertheless... I would rather she didn't hang around Jake.\\
77 - Fine. I'll talk to her.\\
78 - Thank you.\\
79 - You're welcome.\\
80 - Now, unless you want to lather up my fanny,\\
81 - I'm gonna go hop in the shower with Anacoth and Linda.\\
82 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men... *\\
83 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men... *\\
84 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men *\\
85 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh *\\
86 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
87 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men. *\\
88 - * Men.\\
89 - ( screams )\\
90 - Isabella, I, uh... I didn't hear you come in.\\
91 - You weren't meant to.\\
92 - So...\\
93 - You think I'm a bad influence on your kid?\\
94 - Uh, well, gee, I-I wouldn't put it that way.\\
95 - But, you know, kids are, uh, impressionable\\
96 - and the violent, psychosexual imagery of your...\\
97 - body art... um, not-not to mention the smoking\\
98 - aren't necessarily something a young boy needs to...\\
99 - Why are you taking my hair?\\
100 - Just a little quirk of mine.\\
101 - Uh-huh.\\
102 - I used to collect stamps.\\
103 - You know, people like you have been persecuting\\
104 - people like me for thousands of years.\\
105 - Hmm.\\
106 - Well, that's a bit hard to believe, seeing as\\
107 - people like me have historically been victims and food.\\
108 - But, uh, just for clarity,\\
109 - who exactly are the people like you?\\
110 - Those whose eyes are open to a greater reality\\
111 - than you could ever imagine.\\
112 - I see.\\
113 - And do they all collect hair?\\
114 - Don't mock what you don't understand.\\
115 - I'm sorry.\\
116 - I tend to resort to mocking when I'm... totally creeped out.\\
117 - I don't like you.\\
118 - Yeah, well... I'm rubber, you're glue...\\
119 - something, something, something you.\\
120 - So be it.\\
121 - So be it.\\
122 - ( wry chuckle )\\
123 - So be it.\\
124 - ( scoffs )\\
125 - Ow!\\
126 - Ah, damn it.\\
127 - Ow!\\
128 - What the hell?\\
129 - ( Isabella chuckling maliciously )\\
130 - * Men.\\
131 - ALAN: I don't think so, Mom.\\
132 - First of all, I'm just not a big fan of costume parties.\\
133 - Well... yeah, Jake likes "The Wizard of Oz,"\\
134 - but I just don't think he'd enjoy hanging out\\
135 - with a bunch of drunken real estate agents\\
136 - dressed like Judy Garland.\\
137 - Okay, I'll get him.\\
138 - Mom wants to ask you something.\\
139 - Hi, Mom. No.\\
140 - What happened to your face?\\
141 - Nothing, I just thought I'd put\\
142 - little blood-soaked pieces of toilet paper on it.\\
143 - What do you think?\\
144 - It suits you.\\
145 - Hmm.\\
146 - What's the deal with your eye?\\
147 - I don't know. I think I'm getting a sty.\\
148 - Huh.\\
149 - Might be a bit much with the toilet paper.\\
150 - I'd go with one or the other.\\
151 - Thank you for your input.\\
152 - No problem.\\
153 - Where are you going?\\
154 - Isabella's taking me to a party.\\
155 - She said it's going to be out of control.\\
156 - Can you imagine what this girl considers to be out of control?\\
157 - Well, let's see.\\
158 - Uh, biting the head off a live chicken?\\
159 - Vivisecting homeless people and playing hacky-sack\\
160 - with their still-beating hearts?\\
161 - What the hell are you talking about?\\
162 - Do you have any idea what Isabella's really into?\\
163 - So she's a little kinky.\\
164 - No, no, no, kinky is a feather duster up your butt.\\
165 - I think this woman tried to put a curse on me.\\
166 - Oh, please.\\
167 - Who of us hasn't done that?\\
168 - To know you is to curse you.\\
169 - She took my hair.\\
170 - She took your hair?\\
171 - Yeah.\\
172 - Yeah, and then she laughed like\\
173 - ( laughs maliciously )\\
174 - Oh, well, that's different.\\
175 - So you see my concern?\\
176 - Yes, I do.\\
177 - Good night.\\
178 - Where are you going?\\
179 - To pick up a bottle of wine and a feather duster.\\
180 - ( electronica music playing )\\
181 - You sure my Mercedes is okay parked on the street?\\
182 - I mean, I gave that crack whore $10 to watch it,\\
183 - but now I'm thinking, who's watching the crack whore?\\
184 - Don't worry about your car.\\
185 - Okay.\\
186 - So where are all the guys?\\
187 - How come I'm the only weenie in this pot of beans?\\
188 - Because this party is in your honor.\\
189 - Really? What'd I do?\\
190 - You're a vessel of the masculine life force.\\
191 - You picked up on that?\\
192 - I tell people that all the time and they just get snotty.\\
193 - These women are all my sisters.\\
194 - They all want to please you.\\
195 - Well, gosh, that's swell.\\
196 - Then you're okay with this?\\
197 - It was my idea.\\
198 - Let me tell you something, Isabella,\\
199 - you are just tops in my book.\\
200 - Hey, this is very tasty.\\
201 - What'd you say this was?\\
202 - Secret elixir.\\
203 - Secret elixir, huh?\\
204 - Well, I'm usually more of a bourbon guy,\\
205 - but, push comes to shove,\\
206 - I don't know what the hell's in that, either.\\
207 - Oh, boy.\\
208 - Getting a little fuzzy around the edges.\\
209 - You got any crackers?\\
210 - ( snaps fingers twice )\\
211 - He's ready.\\
212 - You bet your gothic ass I am.\\
213 - Whee!\\
214 - Where are we going?\\
215 - To the altar room.\\
216 - Oh, boy!\\
217 - What's the altar room?\\
218 - It's where we anoint you.\\
219 - Oh, boy!\\
220 - I'm getting anointed!\\
221 - Sounds nasty!\\
222 - Anoint him.\\
223 - ALL WOMEN: Anoint him.\\
224 - ALL WOMEN ( chanting ): Anoint him. Anoint him. Anoint him.\\
225 - Anoint him. Anoint him. * I can't stop this feeling\\
226 - Anoint him. Anoint him. * Deep inside of me\\
227 - Anoint him. Anoint him. * Girl, you just don't realize\\
228 - Anoint him. Anoint him. * What you do to me...\\
229 - Morning.\\
230 - Morning.\\
231 - Great googly-mooglies!\\
232 - What the hell happened to you?\\
233 - I'm not sure. Looks like you got bit on the face\\
234 - by one of them ebola monkeys.\\
235 - I don't think so, Berta.\\
236 - I mean, you weren't exactly eye candy going in, but...\\
237 - ...now, woof!\\
238 - you could scare the flies off a manure truck.\\
239 - Thank you. Until you said that,\\
240 - I was feeling a little self-conscious.\\
241 - Aw, you know I'm razzing you, don't you?\\
242 - Yeah. I mean, it's really not that...\\
243 - Oh, sweet Lord, I'm gonna lose my Eggos!\\
244 - Okay, if open mike night in the burn ward is over,\\
245 - I am just gonna make myself some breakfast\\
246 - and get out of here before Charlie's new girlfriend gets up.\\
247 - Why, is she not as compassionate as me?\\
248 - No. She's just a very creepy woman.\\
249 - Well, putting aside the whole pot-kettle thing,\\
250 - creepy how?\\
251 - Well, she's got tattoos all over her.\\
252 - I've got tattoos.\\
253 - And she's got this very dark, hostile attitude.\\
254 - Okay, you might actually like her.\\
255 - But I-I just don't want to have anything to do with her.\\
256 - ISABELLA: Good morning.\\
257 - Isabella. Hello.\\
258 - That's a nasty looking eye you've got there.\\
259 - It's... just a stye.\\
260 - Right?\\
261 - What else would it be?\\
262 - Hey, Vampira...\\
263 - tell Count Humpula to get out of bed\\
264 - so I can change his sheets.\\
265 - Charlie and I are spending the entire day in bed.\\
266 - We do not want to be disturbed.\\
267 - Do you understand?\\
268 - Is it getting cold in here?\\
269 - Do you understand?\\
270 - Yep, you betcha.\\
271 - Thank you.\\
272 - Bye, Alan.\\
273 - Take care of that eye.\\
274 - I will. Thank you.\\
275 - See what I mean about...\\
276 - What are you doing?\\
277 - Leaving. Why?\\
278 - Did you see that bitch?\\
279 - You got to put a whole lot of gone\\
280 - between you and a broad like that.\\
281 - But-but wait a sec...\\
282 - Good-bye and good luck.\\
283 - * Men...\\
284 - ( gasps softly )\\
285 - ( sighs ): Hmm...\\
286 - Ho!\\
287 - Ho!\\
288 - That is some stye.\\
289 - Oh, this is no stye.\\
290 - This is something else. Something evil.\\
291 - Something ugly.\\
292 - And you know what, I'm starting to think\\
293 - your girlfriend did this.\\
294 - Oh, come on.\\
295 - Charlie, this isn't just about me.\\
296 - Have you taken a look at yourself recently?\\
297 - Oh, man.\\
298 - It's gonna take more than a little spray-on tan to fix that.\\
299 - Do you realize how long you've been upstairs with her?\\
300 - That depends. On what?\\
301 - On what day it is.\\
302 - It's Sunday evening. I haven't seen you\\
303 - since last night when you went to that party.\\
304 - Oh, yeah, the party.\\
305 - That was some great party.\\
306 - What happened?\\
307 - I have no idea.\\
308 - Although I did wake up with this.\\
309 - Oh, my God!\\
310 - Am I Jewish now?\\
311 - Charlie, that's not a Star of David, it's a pentagram.\\
312 - It's a Satanic symbol used to call forth demons from Hell.\\
313 - Oh, that's not good.\\
314 - You need to cut Isabella loose.\\
315 - I can't do that. Why not?\\
316 - Because together we shall spawn a child named Giglamesh\\
317 - and he shall bring forth a new age of darkness.\\
318 - You know what, maybe it is time\\
319 - to slow this relationship down a little bit.\\
320 - Slow it down?\\
321 - You need to drive a stake through its heart!\\
322 - Is she still here?\\
323 - Yeah.\\
324 - Okay, here's the plan.\\
325 - ( loudly ): Um, so, uh, we'll submit to her will\\
326 - and, uh, serve the Lord Beelzebub with all our hearts.\\
327 - I'll grab Jake; you start the car.\\
328 - We'll drive somewhere safe, I'm thinking the Vatican.\\
329 - Don't be ridiculous.\\
330 - What are you gonna do?\\
331 - Well, you said it: we have to cut her loose.\\
332 - "We?" No, I didn't say "we." I never said "we."\\
333 - Hear us, O Horned One.\\
334 - Wrap your dark wings around this young soul\\
335 - and grant him all the rewards he desires.\\
336 - Okay, um, hi, Mr. Horned One.\\
337 - Here's the deal: I'll trade you my soul for...\\
338 - What do I get, like, three wishes?\\
339 - He's the Lord of the Underworld, not a genie.\\
340 - Oh, okay.\\
341 - Can I talk to a genie?\\
342 - ALAN: Jake, get over here!\\
343 - Sorry, Dad, but you're no longer my master.\\
344 - The hell I'm not! Go to your room!\\
345 - You know, I'm old enough to choose my own religion.\\
346 - Go!\\
347 - How dare you interfere?\\
348 - Good question.\\
349 - Alan, tell her... how we dare.\\
350 - Hey, you brought her here, you get her out.\\
351 - Are you trying to get rid of me?\\
352 - Okay, well, no, not-not-not you personally.\\
353 - This is more of a legal issue.\\
354 - Uh, it turns out Malibu is not zoned for Satanic rituals.\\
355 - Or any of the black arts, really.\\
356 - Right, Alan? Uh, that's-that's true. Uh...\\
357 - You're fine in Hollywood.\\
358 - Um...\\
359 - Pretty much anywhere east of the 405 freeway, actually.\\
360 - Shut up, Alan.\\
361 - Just trying to help.\\
362 - Did you really think that you could just end this?\\
363 - Uh, I was kinda hopin'.\\
364 - Don't you realize that our souls are now bound together,\\
365 - destined to writhe ecstatically in blessed hellfire for all eternity?\\
366 - Boy, I know how to pick 'em, don't I?\\
367 - Charlie, do you remember the vows you took last night?\\
368 - Vows? You took vows? What kind of vows?\\
369 - If you'll shut up, maybe we'll find out.\\
370 - You vowed unending fealty to the sisterhood of the coven.\\
371 - You did that? Why would you do that?\\
372 - Will you please shut up.\\
373 - I did that? Why would I do that?\\
374 - Did you think that all those beautiful women were pleasuring you\\
375 - because of your boyish charm?\\
376 - Well, no, not-not- not-not all of them.\\
377 - I-I... I just figured after the first three or four,\\
378 - word-of-mouth started to spread.\\
379 - Wait, wait, uh,\\
380 - how many women are we talking about here?\\
381 - I don't know, nine, ten...\\
382 - 13, the sacred number.\\
383 - And a personal best for me.\\
384 - How do you have sex with 13 women at one time?\\
385 - Well, apparently, you have to take some vows.\\
386 - Okay...\\
387 - okay, listen, uh, thank the girls for me,\\
388 - tell 'em I had a wonderful time, but...\\
389 - I'm gonna have to pass on the fealty stuff.\\
390 - I have a previous commitment to, you know, God.\\
391 - It doesn't work that way, Charlie.\\
392 - If you break your vows, you bring down upon yourself\\
393 - the ancient curse of betrayal.\\
394 - Well, that's just the chance I'll have to take.\\
395 - So be it.\\
396 - ( mocking ): So be it.\\
397 - Just kidding.\\
398 - Um, simply out of curiosity,\\
399 - what-what exactly is this curse?\\
400 - What-what should I be on the lookout for?\\
401 - Your crops will wither in the field.\\
402 - Yeah, okay.\\
403 - Your cattle will sicken and die.\\
404 - Uh-huh.\\
405 - Your manhood will shrivel and become a useless husk.\\
406 - I gotta fold here, Alan.\\
407 - Okay, you got me.\\
408 - What do you say we call the girls over\\
409 - and start spawning baby Giglamesh?\\
410 - Charlie, don't do this!\\
411 - Hey, when she's shriveling your husk, then you get a vote.\\
412 - Go ahead, call the coven.\\
413 - ( knocking on door )\\
414 - ( chuckles ): Wow...\\
415 - you gals could make a fortune delivering pizzas.\\
416 - Mom?\\
417 - Boo, everybody.\\
418 - Now, not a word, Charlie.\\
419 - You are all coming with me to my costume party,\\
420 - and I'm not taking no for an answer.\\
421 - Evelyn?\\
422 - Isabella.\\
423 - You know each other?\\
424 - In a manner of speaking.\\
425 - What are you doing here?\\
426 - Nothing.\\
427 - These are my sons.\\
428 - It was an accident.\\
429 - I-I had... I had no idea.\\
430 - Please believe me.\\
431 - Good-bye, Isabella.\\
432 - Yes. Good-bye.\\
433 - Bye, Charlie.\\
434 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.\\
435 - What about the-the vows, the curse and the shriveling?\\
436 - I have no idea what he's talking about.\\
437 - What? She's in my Pilates class.\\
438 - Okay. I'll buy that.\\
439 - Now, are you coming to my party,\\
440 - or are you gonna give me a hard time?\\
441 - I'm coming to the party.\\
442 - ALAN: Me, too.\\
443 - Jake! Come get your costume!\\
444 - What's Mom gonna wear? Shut up.\\
445 - * Men...\\
446 - Grandmommy doesn't want to be late to her costume party.\\
447 - Oh, come on, boys, sell it.\\
448 - Very nice!\\
449 - Now fly, my pets, fly!\\
450 - I call shotgun.\\
451 - ( screaming laughter )

14 - Shouldn't you, uh, make a wish and blow out the candles?\\
15 - Oh, right, right.\\
16 - I wish this was chocolate fudge.\\
17 - Now, it's time for the party games.\\
18 - I got one.\\
19 - It's called "Drink Until This Night Makes Some Sort of Sense."\\
20 - I'll go first.\\
21 - Nope, not yet.\\
22 - Round Two...\\
23 - JAKE: Uncle Charlie?\\
24 - Go away!\\
25 - Have you seen my iPod?\\
26 - No.\\
27 - What about you, Rose?\\
28 - No. Sorry, Jake.\\
29 - Oh, man.\\
30 - Good morning, sleepy head.\\
31 - Morning.\\
32 - So, what's new?\\
33 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
34 - * Men... *\\
35 - Mmm, that's good coffee.\\
36 - Good morning.\\
37 - It's gettin' there.\\
38 - Whose birthday cake?\\
39 - Rose.\\
40 - Oh. Surprise party?\\
41 - No, I think she saw it coming.\\
42 - 'Morning.\\
43 - 'Morning. Hey.\\
44 - Coffee?\\
45 - Can you make it to go?\\
46 - To go?\\
47 - Yeah, the thing is, I made a little... boo-boo.\\
48 - A boo-boo? A boo-boo.\\
49 - Anyway, I may have\\
50 - to leave town for a few days.\\
51 - Why? What'd you do?\\
52 - Rose.\\
53 - What?\\
54 - I-I did Rose.\\
55 - Wait, you had sex with Rose?\\
56 - Are you insane?\\
57 - Moot point, Alan.\\
58 - What I have to do now is find my passport\\
59 - and head for the border.\\
60 - What you have to do\\
61 - is tell Rose th-th-that I was drunk\\
62 - and I'm sorry and that there's no reason\\
63 - to hunt me down and glue my testicles to my thigh.\\
64 - Again.\\
65 - I'll tell you right now,\\
66 - you're swabbin' on your own nail polish remover this time.\\
67 - That wasn't pleasant for either of us, Berta.\\
68 - What the hell were you thinking?\\
69 - Thinking?\\
70 - There was no thinking.\\
71 - We had a few tequila shots and we were talking,\\
72 - having a nice evening,\\
73 - then somebody suggested a sponge bath.\\
74 - Somebody?\\
75 - It might've been me.\\
76 - Anyway, the next thing I know,\\
77 - Jake is waking us up looking for his iPod.\\
78 - Jake saw you in bed with Rose?\\
79 - No.\\
80 - Oh, great, great. That's just great.\\
81 - What am I gonna tell him?\\
82 - Who cares? He's 11.\\
83 - He'll get over it.\\
84 - I'm the one who still has a bald patch on my scrotum.\\
85 - And let me tell ya, the comb-over isn't foolin' anybody.\\
86 - Morning.\\
87 - Oh. Hey, look, it's Rose.\\
88 - Morning, Rose.\\
89 - BERTA: Hey, birthday girl!\\
90 - Did you get anything good last night?\\
91 - It was a wonderful party.\\
92 - Isn't that nice?\\
93 - Can I get you anything?\\
94 - Coffee? Orange juice? Industrial-strength adhesive?\\
95 - No, I can't stay.\\
96 - I'm having a birthday lunch with my dad.\\
97 - Oh, well, that's great.\\
98 - Not that I'm anxious for you to leave.\\
99 - But it's great that you're gonna spend some time with your dad.\\
100 - Dads are great.\\
101 - I like the word "dad" better than "father."\\
102 - You know, if Hitler had called Germany the Dadland\\
103 - instead of the Fatherland,\\
104 - I bet it would've been a much friendlier country.\\
105 - Charlie.\\
106 - Yes.\\
107 - You're acting crazy.\\
108 - Am I?\\
109 - Hey, if anybody knows...\\
110 - I understand last night was just one of those things.\\
111 - I have no expectations.\\
112 - Okay. Good.\\
113 - And...?\\
114 - And nothing.\\
115 - I'll see ya later.\\
116 - Bye, guys.\\
117 - Bye.\\
118 - Oh, God, it's worse than I thought.\\
119 - What are you talking about?\\
120 - She sounded perfectly fine with everything.\\
121 - Berta, tell him.\\
122 - She's nuts. He's screwed.\\
123 - * Men...\\
124 - Uncle Charlie? Yeah, buddy?\\
125 - You know what'd be cool? If you and Rose got married.\\
126 - Yeah, Charlie, that would be cool.\\
127 - I could be the best man.\\
128 - Carry the ring for you and the medication for her.\\
129 - Do pharmacies have bridal registries?\\
130 - Hey,\\
131 - have you guys talked about having kids?\\
132 - Are we gonna hear the pitter-patter\\
133 - of teeny-weeny crazy-ass feet?\\
134 - No. He's not gonna marry Rose.\\
135 - Why not? He's already getting sex from her.\\
136 - Jake, Jake... the only reason Rose was in my bed\\
137 - is because she was too tired to go home.\\
138 - Uncle Charlie, I'm an underachiever, not an idiot.\\
139 - Okay, fine.\\
140 - You want the truth?\\
141 - Charlie, please be discreet. Just because\\
142 - a man and woman have sex\\
143 - doesn't mean they have to get married.\\
144 - It doesn't mean they have to see each other again.\\
145 - It doesn't even mean they have to give their actual names.\\
146 - Thank you for your discretion.\\
147 - No, no, no.\\
148 - It's time somebody taught him the facts of life.\\
149 - What facts? That you did a stupid, stupid thing\\
150 - 'cause you're a stupid, stupid man?\\
151 - I was getting to that.\\
152 - Why was it stupid?\\
153 - Because he had sex with someone he doesn't love.\\
154 - No, no, because I had sex with someone\\
155 - who knows how to disable the alarm system.\\
156 - And who has no compunction about shaving my head while I sleep.\\
157 - What's a compunction?\\
158 - Go get ready for bed.\\
159 - Sounds dirty.\\
160 - Just go.\\
161 - ( in deep voice ): Hey, lady, I can see your compunction.\\
162 - Charlie, will you do me a favor? What?\\
163 - Don't talk to my kid about sex. Why?\\
164 - Because you're a pig.\\
165 - Okay.\\
166 - What was that?\\
167 - What was what?\\
168 - It was a thump.\\
169 - What do you mean, a thump?\\
170 - You know, a thump.\\
171 - Like a crazy woman dressed as a ninja jumping from a tree\\
172 - and landing on the roof with cat-like precision.\\
173 - I didn't hear anything.\\
174 - Well, I did.\\
175 - I guess your hearing's more acute\\
176 - when your nuts are on the line.\\
177 - Come on, Charlie, you don't really think\\
178 - Rose is gonna do anything?\\
179 - Hey, I never told you half the weird stuff\\
180 - she pulled around here.\\
181 - Why not?\\
182 - Well, we needed a baby-sitter\\
183 - and I didn't want you to get spooked.\\
184 - Okay, I'm listening.\\
185 - One time, she trained a seagull to swoop down...\\
186 - ( knock at door ) Oh, God, this is it!\\
187 - Come on, Charlie.\\
188 - I cannot believe a grown man like you\\
189 - is afraid of a little girl.\\
190 - A little girl with a big seagull.\\
191 - Went right for my eyes.\\
192 - You ever seen one of 'em swoop down on a picnic table\\
193 - to grab a french fry?\\
194 - It was just like that. Charlie...\\
195 - I'll bet that's how she trained it.\\
196 - Took a picture of me and put french fries all over it.\\
197 - You're being ridiculous.\\
198 - ( knock at door )\\
199 - Am I?\\
200 - We'll see.\\
201 - Are you Charlie Harper?\\
202 - Yes, I am.\\
203 - I'm Rose's father.\\
204 - I don't see a way to back out of this, do you?\\
205 - So, you're Rose's dad.\\
206 - I can see the resemblance.\\
207 - You and I need to talk.\\
208 - Well, sure, if you want.\\
209 - I'm booked up for the next few days,\\
210 - but maybe we can pencil something in for next week.\\
211 - Now.\\
212 - Or now.\\
213 - There's a little window in my schedule now.\\
214 - Come on in.\\
215 - Thank you.\\
216 - Can I get you something to drink?\\
217 - I'm fine.\\
218 - Okay, well, then you don't mind if I have\\
219 - a little conversation starter, do you?\\
220 - Knock yourself out.\\
221 - I'm sure gonna try.\\
222 - So, uh, I'm, uh, Charlie's brother, Alan.\\
223 - Nice to meet you.\\
224 - Same here.\\
225 - Uh... I never slept with your daughter.\\
226 - I'm not surprised.\\
227 - Okay, Rose's dad.\\
228 - Call me Harvey.\\
229 - Okay, Harvey.\\
230 - That's easy.\\
231 - Like the big invisible rabbit in that Jimmy Stewart movie.\\
232 - What was that called?\\
233 - Harvey.\\
234 - Right.\\
235 - Duh.\\
236 - Loved that movie.\\
237 - A lot of people don't know it was originally a play,\\
238 - and then after the movie,\\
239 - they tried to make it a musical... Charlie.\\
240 - Yes, sir? Sit down.\\
241 - Yes, sir.\\
242 - Now... what are your intentions towards my daughter?\\
243 - Oh, right to the chase.\\
244 - Straight shooter.\\
245 - I like that.\\
246 - Ah, thirsty.\\
247 - So, where were we?\\
248 - He wants to know what your intentions are towards Rose.\\
249 - Thank you.\\
250 - Well, I-I would have to say that my intentions are good.\\
251 - In fact, anybody who knows me would confirm\\
252 - that Charlie Harper has good intentions.\\
253 - His actions, on the other hand,\\
254 - are usually selfish and asinine.\\
255 - Again, thank you.\\
256 - Okay, Harvey, well, I'm glad we had this chance to talk...\\
257 - Sit down.\\
258 - Sorry.\\
259 - So, are you going to marry my daughter or not?\\
260 - Not. Not?\\
261 - A very well-intended not.\\
262 - So, after two years together,\\
263 - you just plan to keep on stringing her along?\\
264 - No, I would never...\\
265 - Wait a minute, did you say two years?\\
266 - Now, look, Rose cares very much about you,\\
267 - and she's not going to leave you.\\
268 - So I think the honorable thing for you to do\\
269 - is to let her go.\\
270 - Believe me, Harvey, I've tried.\\
271 - God, how I've tried.\\
272 - What's the problem?\\
273 - You love her too much?\\
274 - Not exactly.\\
275 - I mean, she is a wonderful gal, and I do care for her, but...\\
276 - you see...\\
277 - What, the peanut gallery taking a break?\\
278 - Harvey, the truth is, Charlie has tried to end it,\\
279 - but your daughter doesn't handle rejection all that well.\\
280 - Or all that legally.\\
281 - And in my defense,\\
282 - we're not talking about a long-term relationship.\\
283 - We're talking about a couple of nights of drunken,\\
284 - frenzied sex two years apart.\\
285 - That's your defense?\\
286 - I didn't say it was a good defense.\\
287 - You'll have to forgive my brother.\\
288 - He thinks with his penis, and his penis isn't very bright.\\
289 - That's true.\\
290 - Anybody who knows me will confirm that.\\
291 - ( knock at door )\\
292 - I can confirm that.\\
293 - Oh, for God's sake.\\
294 - Rose, did you tell your father\\
295 - we've been going out for two years?\\
296 - Well, yeah.\\
297 - I thought it sounded better than saying we had a one-night stand,\\
298 - and then I stalked you for two years.\\
299 - She's not wrong.\\
300 - Daddy...\\
301 - try to understand.\\
302 - I didn't want you feel sorry for me,\\
303 - or try to set me up with anybody...\\
304 - or have me committed.\\
305 - Oh, sweetheart, I would never do that.\\
306 - We're a wealthy family.\\
307 - We can afford home care.\\
308 - Okay.\\
309 - Well, I'm glad we had this chance to clear the air.\\
310 - I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about,\\
311 - so I'll let you get to it.\\
312 - Mom?\\
313 - Hang on, dear.\\
314 - ( phone ringing )\\
315 - Hello?\\
316 - Alan. Oh, good, I'm glad you're home.\\
317 - Listen, uh,\\
318 - I'm in the neighborhood, and I know how Charlie hates it\\
319 - when I just drop in unannounced, so I thought I'd call first.\\
320 - I'll let him know.\\
321 - Charlie, Mom's coming over.\\
322 - Tell her I'm not here.\\
323 - Hi, sweetie.\\
324 - Oh, hello, Rose.\\
325 - Hi, Evelyn.\\
326 - Daddy, this is Charlie's mom, Evelyn.\\
327 - Evelyn, this is my father, Harvey.\\
328 - Harvey, nice to meet you.\\
329 - Nice to meet you.\\
330 - So what are we talking about?\\
331 - Well, Charlie and I got hammered last night,\\
332 - and then somebody suggested a sponge bath...\\
333 - It might've been me.\\
334 - And then we ended up spending the night together.\\
335 - I see.\\
336 - Are you as proud of yours as I am of mine?\\
337 - Well, you know, you do the best you can to raise them,\\
338 - but, in the end, they drive down life's highway\\
339 - on their own.\\
340 - Isn't that the truth.\\
341 - I think God gives us children\\
342 - so death won't come as such a disappointment.\\
343 - So, Evelyn... are you married?\\
344 - Not at the moment.\\
345 - Why?\\
346 - What'd you have in mind?\\
347 - Well, maybe we could start with a little dinner.\\
348 - Sounds good.\\
349 - But how do you want to finish?\\
350 - Simultaneously.\\
351 - Oh, he's good.\\
352 - * Men...\\
353 - ( phone rings )\\
354 - Hello. Oh, hi, Mom.\\
355 - Hold on. Alan!\\
356 - Yeah? Get the door.\\
357 - Boys, we have a problem.\\
358 - We need to talk.\\
359 - What's going on?\\
360 - We haven't seen you in a couple of days.\\
361 - Not that we're complaining. Merely an observation.\\
362 - Well, as you know, I have been seeing Rose's father.\\
363 - Uh-huh. And how's that going?\\
364 - ( sighs ): At first it was wonderful.\\
365 - He was handsome, charming, and a raging bull in the sack.\\
366 - No mental pictures.\\
367 - Push 'em out.\\
368 - Don't give them to me.\\
369 - But what I didn't realize is the man has\\
370 - the emotional stability of a bag of rats in a burning meth lab.\\
371 - What'd he do?\\
372 - It's what he didn't do.\\
373 - Okay, what didn't he do?\\
374 - Leave.\\
375 - A couple of days of Viagra-enhanced boinking,\\
376 - and he suddenly thinks he lives with me.\\
377 - He's moving my furniture around!\\
378 - He's getting his mail forwarded.\\
379 - He had a satellite dish installed.\\
380 - Did he get the NFL package?\\
381 - Charlie, please, this is not funny.\\
382 - This man is obsessed with me.\\
383 - He will not let me out of his sight.\\
384 - Wherever I go, there he is\\
385 - with a stupid, love-smitten look on his face.\\
386 - You just want to hit him with a shovel.\\
387 - Well, what do you want us to do?\\
388 - Come over to my house and hit him with a shovel.\\
389 - Wouldn't it be easier to keep feeding him Viagra\\
390 - until he strokes out?\\
391 - Charlie, don't be ridiculous.\\
392 - That could take months.\\
393 - Come on, now, guys, think.\\
394 - How can I get this loon out of my house?\\
395 - I say we bring in some expert help.\\
396 - Way ahead of you-- Rose!\\
397 - Yes, Charlie?\\
398 - Road trip.\\
399 - Oh, goody, I'll meet you in the garage.\\
400 - ( whistle blowing on TV )\\
401 - ( sighs )\\
402 - Daddy?\\
403 - Oh, Rose, good, you got my change of address card.\\
404 - And there's my other favorite gal.\\
405 - Hello, Harvey.\\
406 - Where were you, puddin' pop?\\
407 - I was worried sick.\\
408 - I just went out.\\
409 - I didn't see you leave.\\
410 - That's because I climbed\\
411 - out the laundry room window.\\
412 - Oh, aren't you a limber little minx?\\
413 - Daddy, we need to talk.\\
414 - Yes, right away, honey.\\
415 - Hey, fellas!\\
416 - Are you ready for some football?\\
417 - Evie, why don't you get our guests some cold drinks?\\
418 - Yes, of course, dear.\\
419 - Garden shed, shovel, bag of lime.\\
420 - Daddy, listen to me very closely.\\
421 - Okay.\\
422 - You don't live here.\\
423 - Yes, I do.\\
424 - Look at me.\\
425 - We've been through this before, remember?\\
426 - The pretty receptionist at your psychiatrist's office?\\
427 - Oh, yeah. Cheryl.\\
428 - She had a mean lawyer.\\
429 - Well, this is different.\\
430 - Evelyn and I are in love, and we're gonna get married.\\
431 - Isn't that right, puddin' pop?\\
432 - Not if you were the last crazy man on earth.\\
433 - Guys, feel free to call me "Dad."\\
434 - No, thank you. I couldn't.\\
435 - Daddy, pay attention.\\
436 - Okay.\\
437 - I know what it feels like to be so in love with someone\\
438 - you want to crawl inside them\\
439 - so that you're wearing their skin\\
440 - like a leotard with nipples.\\
441 - But what I've learned is that not everyone\\
442 - is ready for that kind of intimacy.\\
443 - Take me and Charlie, for example.\\
444 - We slept together two years ago,\\
445 - realized how much better we were as friends,\\
446 - and we haven't done it again since.\\
447 - We haven't?\\
448 - You were too drunk.\\
449 - I was gonna tell you eventually.\\
450 - Why'd you let me think we did?\\
451 - Because it doesn't make any difference.\\
452 - I'm in this for the long haul.\\
453 - You know, sweetheart, when Evie and I get married,\\
454 - Charlie will be your stepbrother.\\
455 - Oh, I didn't think of that.\\
456 - Ooh, tres kinky.\\
457 - Rose, stick with the plan.\\
458 - Okay.\\
459 - I didn't want to have to do this,\\
460 - but I brought someone else here to talk to you.\\
461 - Who?\\
462 - Come on in, Grandma!\\
463 - You brought Mother?\\
464 - HARVEY'S MOTHER: Harvey!\\
465 - How many times have I told you\\
466 - not to leave the estate without telling me?\\
467 - Aw, Mom.\\
468 - Playtime's over.\\
469 - Get in the car, we're going home.\\
470 - But, Mom, we're getting married!\\
471 - To this trash?\\
472 - I don't think so.\\
473 - Excuse me?\\
474 - Roll with it, Mom.\\
475 - I'm counting to three, Harvey.\\
476 - One, two...\\
477 - I'm going, I'm going.\\
478 - Keep the robe.\\
479 - Thanks, I'm not wearing pants.\\
480 - Harvey! Do you want me to put you over my knee?\\
481 - All right, I'm going.\\
482 - He's really a good boy.\\
483 - But these things happen when you marry a first cousin.\\
484 - I say they're lucky to have thumbs.\\
485 - * Men...\\
486 - I'm really sorry to impose on you.\\
487 - I just feel very uncomfortable\\
488 - being home alone tonight.\\
489 - No problem, you can sleep in my room.\\
490 - Where will you sleep?\\
491 - I don't know, I'll find somebody.\\
492 - I'm beat.\\
493 - I'm gonna go to bed.\\
494 - Good night. Good night, sweetheart.\\
495 - Good night, Mom.\\
496 - Sleep tight, puddin' pop.
\subsection {Episode 08: That Voodoo That I Do Do}
1 - Oh, I knew it.\\
2 - There's no extra foam in my latte.\\
3 - You ask for extra foam,\\
4 - you might as well be asking for a piggyback ride,\\
5 - you know what I mean?\\
6 - Charlie? Charlie?\\
7 - Oh! Of course.\\
8 - Man's got a heat-seeking missile in his pants.\\
9 - Is it too much to ask\\
10 - that when we go out for a cup of coffee\\
11 - you at least stay within earshot\\
12 - so I'm not talking to myself like a crazy person?\\
13 - And again, I'm talking to myself like a crazy person.\\
14 - ( hushed ): Look!\\
15 - Yes, I see.\\
16 - Girl pretty. Charlie like.\\
17 - No, girl magnificent.\\
18 - Charlie buy her Lexus.\\
19 - Okay, I thought we were going\\
20 - to be hanging out together,\\
21 - but obviously, your neurotic need\\
22 - for meaningless sex is more important\\
23 - than spending time with your only brother,\\
24 - who despite everything, continues to love you,\\
25 - and is, by the way, your best hope\\
26 - for a viable kidney transplant.\\
27 - You can get yourself home, right?\\
28 - What, what makes you think\\
29 - that she's even available?\\
30 - Maybe she's married. Maybe she's gay.\\
31 - Maybe she's a guy.\\
32 - Hey, I don't see a ring, a girlfriend or a bulge.\\
33 - Now if you'll excuse me,\\
34 - it's time to do that voodoo that I do do so well.\\
35 - Hi.\\
36 - I'm Charlie.\\
37 - Don't care.\\
38 - And you are?\\
39 - Not interested.\\
40 - How do you know?\\
41 - I know.\\
42 - Okay, then.\\
43 - What, you think it's over?\\
44 - 'Cause it's not over.\\
45 - Oh, oh, I'm sorry.\\
46 - I guess I was misled\\
47 - by her complete and utter indifference to you.\\
48 - Yeah, well, watch and learn.\\
49 - So...\\
50 - Go away.\\
51 - How about now? Is it over now?\\
52 - It's not an exact science.\\
53 - Look, if you knew me at all and shut me down,\\
54 - that would be one thing,\\
55 - but to be dismissed on a simple hello,\\
56 - that's a tough pill to swallow.\\
57 - Would you rather I give it to you\\
58 - in a suppository?\\
59 - Well, to be perfectly honest...\\
60 - Good-bye.\\
61 - Hey, hey, did you hear that?\\
62 - What?\\
63 - It's a, it's a fat lady and she's... singing.\\
64 - You'd give up right now, wouldn't you?\\
65 - Charlie, Elvis has left the building.\\
66 - Giving up is a little moot at this point.\\
67 - Yeah, well, that attitude is why you sleep alone\\
68 - with a copy of Monster Boobs magazine under your pillow.\\
69 - Stay out of my room.\\
70 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men... *\\
71 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men... *\\
72 - Men, men, men, men, manly men *\\
73 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh\\

75 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men. *\\
76 - * Men.\\
77 - "Waverly Dance Studio, 3737 Waverly Street."\\
78 - Got it.\\
79 - "Westwood Academy of Dance, 14001 Pico Boulevard."\\
80 - What's going on?\\
81 - I'm mapping out all the dance studios\\
82 - in a five-mile radius of the coffee shop.\\
83 - Why?\\
84 - I can't stop thinking about that girl I met.\\
85 - I have to find her.\\
86 - Hmm, it's a shame\\
87 - you can't let your penis sniff a piece\\
88 - of her clothing.\\
89 - Look, I know her name: Mia.\\
90 - It was written on her coffee cup.\\
91 - I know she's a dancer.\\
92 - She was wearing those leg-warmer thingies\\
93 - and reading a dance magazine.\\
94 - Just 'cause you're reading a dance magazine\\
95 - doesn't make you a dancer.\\
96 - Why not? You're a monster boob.\\
97 - Will you both stay out of my room?!\\
98 - I'll tell you something.\\
99 - Why do you want to go to all this trouble\\
100 - to track down a girl who showed less than no interest in you?\\
101 - A girl who seemed actually repulsed by your very being.\\
102 - A girl whose skin visibly crawled at your mere proximity.\\
103 - Yeah, but did you see her butt?\\
104 - It was like a ripe little peach.\\
105 - That's your answer? Her ass reminded you of fruit?\\
106 - Berta, explain it to him.\\
107 - Well, a lot of the times\\
108 - a peach will have a subtle cleft in it\\
109 - that is visually reminiscent of a woman's...\\
110 - Thanks, thanks. I got it.\\
111 - Alan, do you know why Sir Edmund Hillary\\
112 - wanted to scale Mount Everest?\\
113 - Because it reminded him of a big pointy melon?\\
114 - That's part of the reason.\\
115 - But the main reason was he wanted to do it\\
116 - because everyone thought it was impossible.\\
117 - No, I'm missing the connection here.\\
118 - If a girl like Mia were easy to climb,\\
119 - her head would be covered with flags.\\
120 - So you're looking for a challenge.\\
121 - Exactly.\\
122 - No one takes a picture of the fish that jumps on your boat.\\
123 - I'm confused. Is she a mountain or a fish?\\
124 - Doesn't matter. Either way, I'm going to scale her.\\
125 - And you, why do you enable this behavior?\\
126 - Why? I'll tell you why.\\
127 - Because your brother is the embodiment\\
128 - of the can-do, roll-up-your-sleep spirit\\
129 - that made this country great.\\
130 - He never gets discouraged; he goes after what he wants;\\
131 - and he doesn't know the meaning of the word quit.\\
132 - And if the day should come when any man,\\
133 - no matter how humble, can't go out there\\
134 - and soil the loins of some hot little dancer\\
135 - well, I don't want to live in that America.\\
136 - * O, beautiful, for spacious skies *\\
137 - * For amber waves of grain...\\
138 - Demi plie, grand plie.\\
139 - Okay, very good.\\
140 - Now reverse, demi plie, demi plie,\\
141 - grand plie.\\
142 - Oh, leave me alone.\\
143 - Keep going.\\
144 - Hey, you're a teacher.\\
145 - Hey, you're a stalker.\\
146 - No, no, I was just passing by and happened\\
147 - to look in the window.\\
148 - What's the map for?\\
149 - Oh, this.\\
150 - Well, I had to go to eight other dance studios\\
151 - before I found the right window.\\
152 - Okay, I suppose that could be interpreted as stalking,\\
153 - but it could just as easily be seen\\
154 - as sincerity, persistence, enthusiasm.\\
155 - Mental illness.\\
156 - Oh, come on.\\
157 - I'm clearly smitten. Throw me a bone.\\
158 - Charlie... You remembered my name.\\
159 - That's got to mean something.\\
160 - Yeah, I wrote it down\\
161 - in case I needed to call the cops.\\
162 - Charlie, I don't have time for dating right now.\\
163 - I'm completely focused on my work.\\
164 - Okay, let's talk about work.\\
165 - I've always wanted to learn to dance. Can you teach me?\\
166 - I only teach children.\\
167 - You don't have a class full of large, slow kids\\
168 - I could be part of?\\
169 - All right, how about this?\\
170 - My nephew loves to dance.\\
171 - A gifted little boy. Moves like a gazelle.\\
172 - How old is he?\\
173 - I don't know. 11, 12.\\
174 - It's hard to say. He's got a big head.\\
175 - Frankly, I'd love to have a boy in the class.\\
176 - It's hard to get males that age\\
177 - excited about ballet.\\
178 - Really? 'Cause Jake is just "ballet" this and "ballet" that.\\
179 - Yeah, I'm sure.\\
180 - Tell you what.\\
181 - Why don't you bring him by tomorrow?\\
182 - Great. Maybe afterward, you and I...\\
183 - Charlie, listen carefully.\\
184 - You and I? Never gonna happen.\\
185 - Understood. See you tomorrow.\\
186 - Charlie to base camp.\\
187 - ( mimics radio static )\\
188 - I'm beginning my ascent.\\
189 - * Men.\\
190 - How do you liking the pizza\\
191 - your old Uncle Charlie bought especially for his little buddy?\\
192 - It's good.\\
193 - Well, save room. I've got a half gallon\\
194 - of that double fudge brownie ice cream you like.\\
195 - I don't know. I'm pretty stuffed.\\
196 - You sure?\\
197 - Maybe after I poop.\\
198 - What are you doing?\\
199 - We're eating dinner.\\
200 - You had dinner an hour ago.\\
201 - Well, then he won't need breakfast.\\
202 - I'm on a roll.\\
203 - You had enough to eat.\\
204 - Hey, Jake, you know what I like to do after a nice big meal?\\
205 - What?\\
206 - Learn to dance.\\
207 - Charlie? Yeah?\\
208 - Private word.\\
209 - Sure.\\
210 - What's up?\\
211 - Shame on you.\\
212 - Is that it?\\
213 - You found that girl and now you have\\
214 - some kind of depraved plan to use my son as bait.\\
215 - Yeah, so? It's not like you pay his rent.\\
216 - Why shouldn't he pitch in?\\
217 - I will not allow it.\\
218 - Oh, come on. It's just a couple of ballet lessons.\\
219 - Ballet? Him?\\
220 - I think he has a quiet grace about him.\\
221 - He doesn't have to be good at it.\\
222 - He just has to show up.\\
223 - One lesson. I'm begging you.\\
224 - You know what?\\
225 - It really doesn't matter what I say.\\
226 - You will never convince him to take ballet.\\
227 - But if I can, will you stay out of it?\\
228 - I guess.\\
229 - Great. Hey, Jake...\\
230 - Okay, that might have been bad parenting.\\
231 - I've got a surprise for you.\\
232 - Not more food, is it?\\
233 - I'm starting to feel a little dizzy.\\
234 - No, you're going to get to do something\\
235 - that I'll bet no other boy\\
236 - in your class has ever done.\\
237 - If it's sex, Mitchell Fineman already saw his cousin naked.\\
238 - No, this is better than sex. What?\\
239 - How would he know?\\
240 - You're going to learn to dance ballet.\\
241 - Want to bet?\\
242 - Okay, let me put it this way.\\
243 - How much money will I have to give you\\
244 - to take ballet lessons?\\
245 - How about ten dollars?\\
246 - Wait. Hold on. Hold on.\\
247 - I want a thousand dollars.\\
248 - That's really not ethical.\\
249 - Oh, yeah. I'm the one on shaky moral ground.\\
250 - Okay, I'll give you $500.\\
251 - Split the difference.\\
252 - $250. Done.\\
253 - * Men.\\
254 - Come on. Let's go.\\
255 - I changed my mind.\\
256 - You took my money.\\
257 - I'll give it back.\\
258 - Jake, we're here.\\
259 - You may as well give it a try.\\
260 - Yeah. Give it a try.\\
261 - Who knows? You might like it.\\
262 - I will never forgive you for this.\\
263 - * Men.\\
264 - You didn't tell me I'd be the only boy here.\\
265 - So? The odds are on your side.\\
266 - The odds for what? I'm 11.\\
267 - I want to go home.\\
268 - I thought we had a deal.\\
269 - Charlie, you can't make him stay if he doesn't want to.\\
270 - I love you, Dad.\\
271 - All right, let's get started.\\
272 - Whoa. Who's that?\\
273 - Your teacher.\\
274 - Come on, let's go.\\
275 - Hang on, Dad.\\
276 - Maybe I should give this a chance.\\
277 - Hi. I'm Jake.\\
278 - Hi, Jake. It's nice to meet you.\\
279 - Yeah.\\
280 - You uncle tells me you like ballet.\\
281 - Yeah.\\
282 - Okay. How about you line up with the girls\\
283 - and we'll get started.\\
284 - Yeah.\\
285 - How about that? He's got a crush.\\
286 - It's like watching a dog chase a car.\\
287 - He'll never catch it,\\
288 - and even if he did, he couldn't drive it.\\
289 - He's still doing better than you.\\
290 - Everyone, I'd like you to meet our new student, Jake.\\
291 - GIRLS: Hi, Jake.\\
292 - Yeah. Hi.\\
293 - Okay, let's start in first position.\\
294 - Jake, do you know first position?\\
295 - Is that like missionary position?\\
296 - One... and two...\\
297 - and three... and four.\\
298 - I will never forgive you for this.\\
299 - He's having a great time.\\
300 - ( under breath ): The clueless knucklehead.\\
301 - Okay, very nice, class.\\
302 - Yeah, good hustle, everybody.\\
303 - You're much better, Jake.\\
304 - That's 'cause I have a good teacher.\\
305 - Thank you.\\
306 - All right, that's it for this week.\\
307 - And remember, life is a dance. Live it gracefully.\\
308 - That's my motto.\\
309 - Well, that settles it,\\
310 - I want to be a ballet dancer when I grow up.\\
311 - Really?\\
312 - There's a load off my mind.\\
313 - It's not as easy as it looks, you know.\\
314 - It's pretty hard.\\
315 - It's pretty hard to watch.\\
316 - Thanks.\\
317 - Did you see how far Mia could put her leg over her head?\\
318 - I did notice that, yes.\\
319 - So what do you think?\\
320 - Fred Astaire or Fred Flintstone?\\
321 - He's got a lot of enthusiasm.\\
322 - Yeah, he gets that from me.\\
323 - I thought you were his uncle.\\
324 - Well, that's the whole nature-nurture debate, isn't it?\\
325 - So, listen, Mia...\\
326 - I'm not going out with you, Charlie.\\
327 - I know that. You made it very clear.\\
328 - My question was, is there any more we can do to help Jake?\\
329 - Extra classes, private tutoring,\\
330 - the three of us in Cabo for a long weekend?\\
331 - If he comes to class regularly\\
332 - I think you'll be amazed at his progress.\\
333 - Good. I'd hate to think he's peaked.\\
334 - In fact, we're having a recital next month,\\
335 - and with a lot of work and a little luck we can include him.\\
336 - Charlie to base camp.\\
337 - ( imitates radio static )\\
338 - Pretty cold up here. Visibility zero.\\
339 - ( orchestra playing waltz )\\
340 - ( orchestra playing waltz )\\
341 - ( classical music playing )\\
342 - ( classical music playing )\\
343 - *\\
344 - *\\
345 - *\\
346 - I hope you like this.\\
347 - It's an impertinent little Cabernet\\
348 - with oaky overtones\\
349 - and just a hint of a floral finish.\\
350 - Wow, you really know your wine.\\
351 - No, I just read it off the box.\\
352 - So, what's the plan,\\
353 - get me drunk and take advantage of me?\\
354 - Oh, good, you've done this before.\\
355 - I had a very nice time tonight.\\
356 - Was it worth all the trouble I put you through?\\
357 - You tell me.\\
358 - Ask me again in the morning.\\
359 - Charlie to base camp.\\
360 - I can see the summit.\\
361 - Hey.\\
362 - Hey, Jake.\\
363 - What are you doing up?\\
364 - Why shouldn't I be up?\\
365 - Well, isn't it a little past your bedtime?\\
366 - I don't know what you're talking about.\\
367 - I don't have a bedtime.\\
368 - Okay.\\
369 - So what's going on?\\
370 - Not too much.\\
371 - Where's your dad, Jake?\\
372 - I don't know. Why don't you go look for him?\\
373 - Look, Jake, Mia and I are kind of busy right now.\\
374 - Busy doing what?\\
375 - Talking.\\
376 - Okay.\\
377 - What are we talking about?\\
378 - We're not talking about anything.\\
379 - You're going to bed.\\
380 - Why don't we let Mia decide.\\
381 - Jake, sweetheart,\\
382 - I think you should go to bed.\\
383 - Are you sure?\\
384 - You don't have to decide right now.\\
385 - Your uncle and I would like to spend\\
386 - some alone time together.\\
387 - Oh.\\
388 - All right.\\
389 - You want me to tuck you in?\\
390 - I'm too old to get tucked in, you... you ass-face!\\
391 - Okay, then. Sleep tight, little camper.\\
392 - Kids, huh?\\
393 - Yeah, kids.\\
394 - He never called me an ass-face before.\\
395 - I think he's a little jealous.\\
396 - Yeah.\\
397 - I remember feeling like that when I was his age.\\
398 - Really?\\
399 - The cafeteria lady.\\
400 - Looked like Valerie Bertinelli, but you know, with a hairnet\\
401 - and just the cutest whisper of a mustache.\\
402 - She didn't know I was alive.\\
403 - You poor thing.\\
404 - I'm sorry, Mia, I can't...\\
405 - I can't do this to him.\\
406 - Do what to him?\\
407 - One afternoon I saw the cafeteria lady\\
408 - holding hands with the shop teacher in the parking lot,\\
409 - and it just killed me.\\
410 - Mr. Danopoli.\\
411 - I'll never forget it.\\
412 - She was holding the hand with the missing thumb.\\
413 - You know what?\\
414 - I've got to take you home.\\
415 - I understand.\\
416 - You do?\\
417 - You love Jake.\\
418 - You'd rather give up spending the night with me\\
419 - than risk hurting his feelings.\\
420 - Right.\\
421 - Although, when you spell it out like that\\
422 - it sounds incredibly stupid.\\
423 - You're a very sweet man.\\
424 - Thank you.\\
425 - I was kidding. Let's go upstairs.\\
426 - Charlie, take me home.\\
427 - No, no, no. Let's talk about this.\\
428 - He's 11. He'll get over it.\\
429 - I got over One-Thumb Danopoli.\\
430 - You asleep?\\
431 - You can quit faking. I took her home.\\
432 - Really?\\
433 - Yeah.\\
434 - How come?\\
435 - It's part of the guy code.\\
436 - When two friends like the same girl,\\
437 - one of them has to step aside.\\
438 - Unless she's a good sport,\\
439 - in which case it's like Saturday morning at the bakery.\\
440 - That's a complicated code.\\
441 - Don't worry about it.\\
442 - Bottom line is-- I'm out of the Mia business.\\
443 - Cool.\\
444 - Now go to sleep.\\
445 - Uncle Charlie?\\
446 - Yeah?\\
447 - I'm sorry I called you an ass-face.\\
448 - Yeah.\\
449 - I forgot about that.\\
450 - ( classical music playing )\\
451 - No woman is worth this.\\
452 - I am so proud.\\
453 - Our little boy is growing up.
\subsection {Episode 09: Madame and Her Special Friend}
1 - Jake?\\
2 - Yeah?\\
3 - Are you praying?\\
4 - It's okay, I'm not in school.\\
5 - No, no, it's fine.\\
6 - What are you praying for?\\
7 - I have a math test on Monday.\\
8 - Oh, so you're praying for a good grade?\\
9 - No, that never works.\\
10 - I'm praying for the teacher to get sick.\\
11 - Have you considered just studying for the test?\\
12 - How would that help?\\
13 - Okay, listen to me.\\
14 - Even if we were to assume\\
15 - a God who would be willing\\
16 - to give your teacher a cold...\\
17 - Anthrax.\\
18 - All right, that's it, no more praying.\\
19 - What are you, the Supreme Court?\\
20 - How do you know about the Supreme Court and prayer?\\
21 - This guy on TV, Reverend Don, he talks to God.\\
22 - And he said you should pray to strike down your teacher?\\
23 - No, activist judges.\\
24 - But I figured why can't it work on Miss Stanley?\\
25 - And you know what else?\\
26 - If I send Reverend Don money, God will make me rich.\\
27 - And did you send him money?\\
28 - Wouldn't you?\\
29 - No... God doesn't make people rich.\\
30 - And even if He did, it wouldn't make you happy.\\
31 - Well, I disagree.\\
32 - Jake.\\
33 - Reward without effort is meaningless.\\
34 - Money alone will not give you fulfillment.\\
35 - What about Uncle Charlie?\\
36 - He seems pretty fulfilled and he doesn't do anything.\\
37 - Hey, let me tell you about your Uncle Charlie.\\
38 - He puts on a happy face,\\
39 - but on the inside he is a sad, lonely man.\\
40 - ( woman giggling )\\
41 - You see?\\
42 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
43 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
44 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
45 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
46 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
47 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
48 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
49 - I'm about to do a load of laundry.\\
50 - Last chance to change your underwear.\\
51 - I'm good.\\
52 - Oh, uh, but you might want to hold off\\
53 - on the washing machine.\\
54 - I think Charlie and his friend are still in the shower.\\
55 - I'll check.\\
56 - ( toilet flushing )\\
57 - ( Charlie and woman screaming )\\
58 - You were right.\\
59 - ( doorbell rings )\\
60 - I wouldn't wait for me to get that.\\
61 - Hello.\\
62 - Hello.\\
63 - Uh, we haven't met.\\
64 - I'm Norma Seabury from next door.\\
65 - Oh, it's nice to finally meet you.\\
66 - I'm Alan Harper.\\
67 - Harper?\\
68 - Are you related to that dreadful Charlie?\\
69 - My mother says I am, but frankly,\\
70 - I have my doubts I'm related to her.\\
71 - I see.\\
72 - Well, Alan, there's a little red sports car blocking my driveway.\\
73 - I assume it belongs to one of your brother's hooers.\\
74 - One of his what?\\
75 - Hooers.\\
76 - Ever since he moved in here,\\
77 - it's been one endless parade of hooers.\\
78 - Oh, whores.\\
79 - Well, in all fairness,\\
80 - most of them don't have the math skills to be whores.\\
81 - Be that as it may, I'm late for my hair appointment,\\
82 - and I want that car moved immediately.\\
83 - Oh, absolutely.\\
84 - I am so sorry.\\
85 - Let me track down the... hooer in question\\
86 - and ask her to move it.\\
87 - Thank you.\\
88 - ( sneezes )\\
89 - God bless you.\\
90 - He'd better, I sent in five bucks.\\
91 - Charlie, we have a situation.\\
92 - ( Charlie and woman giggling )\\
93 - CHARLIE: Okay, that looks pretty clean.\\
94 - Now do me.\\
95 - This is so unfair.\\
96 - ( water running )\\
97 - Excuse me?\\
98 - CHARLIE: Not now, Alan, I'm making bubbles.\\
99 - I don't care what her name is,\\
100 - her car is blocking our neighbor's driveway.\\
101 - Oh, sorry, I'll move it.\\
102 - CHARLIE: You can't go now. You're busy.\\
103 - Oh, yeah. I'm busy.\\
104 - All right, just-just tell me where the keys are,\\
105 - and I'll move it.\\
106 - Oh, gosh, no.\\
107 - I don't let strange men touch my car.\\
108 - Oh, good. At least you have respect for your car.\\
109 - Alan, do we need to have another boundaries talk?\\
110 - No, I'm leaving.\\
111 - CHARLIE: Uh-oh, look what's dirty again.\\
112 - WOMAN: Uh-oh!\\
113 - ( mimics giggling )\\
114 - ( toilet flushing )\\
115 - ( screaming )\\
116 - Okay, I have located the owner of the sports car.\\
117 - Is she going to pull it out?\\
118 - Not for a while.\\
119 - Well, how am I supposed to get to my hair appointment?\\
120 - Gee, I'd say you really don't need one.\\
121 - I think your hair looks lovely as it is.\\
122 - Well, aren't you sweet.\\
123 - Are you homosexual?\\
124 - No, just sweet.\\
125 - Listen, you don't have to miss your appointment.\\
126 - I'll drive you.\\
127 - You would do that for me?\\
128 - It would be my pleasure.\\
129 - Sure you're not homosexual?\\
130 - Positive.\\
131 - You would've made a good one.\\
132 - * Men...\\
133 - CHARLIE: You going home already?\\
134 - Nah, I'm going to the opera.\\
135 - They can't end it until I sing.\\
136 - There's no call for sarcasm.\\
137 - ( laughter )\\
138 - Oh, no.\\
139 - What's up?\\
140 - What is that old witch doing here?\\
141 - Old witch?\\
142 - She's a charming woman.\\
143 - Of course she's charming. They're all charming.\\
144 - That's how they lure you into their houses\\
145 - made out of candy and gingerbread.\\
146 - What exactly is the deal between you two?\\
147 - Why do you hate her so much?\\
148 - Why don't you ask her why she hates me?\\
149 - I did. She told me you're a horrible neighbor\\
150 - who doesn't care about anyone but himself.\\
151 - Well, there you go.\\
152 - How can I like somebody who talks about me like that?\\
153 - Hello, Mr. Harper.\\
154 - Hey, Norma.\\
155 - Eat any little kids lately?\\
156 - I could ask you the same thing.\\
157 - And by the way,\\
158 - will she be moving her car out of my driveway any time soon?\\
159 - Well, maybe people wouldn't park in front of your driveway\\
160 - if you didn't put your trash cans in my guest parking spot.\\
161 - You don't have a guest parking spot.\\
162 - There's no such thing as a guest parking spot.\\
163 - It's called a curb and it belongs to the City of Malibu.\\
164 - Hey, if I can pass out on it, I figure it's mine.\\
165 - Well, with that logic, I... I guess you own my doghouse too.\\
166 - That only happened once and Bruno was fine with it.\\
167 - Alan,\\
168 - thank you so much for a wonderful day.\\
169 - I'm looking forward to next Saturday.\\
170 - Oh, me, too.\\
171 - And as for you, Mr. Harper,\\
172 - Bruno never had fleas before that night.\\
173 - You passed out in her doghouse?\\
174 - Hey, I've passed out in wheelbarrows,\\
175 - but this isn't about me.\\
176 - Oh, really? Who is it about?\\
177 - You.\\
178 - Why are you dating a woman\\
179 - who most likely lost her virginity during World War II?\\
180 - And knowing her, probably not to one of our guys.\\
181 - Okay, first of all, we aren't dating.\\
182 - I am escorting her to a charity event.\\
183 - And second of all, her age is irrelevant.\\
184 - The only thing that matters is what's inside a person.\\
185 - Yeah, well, the only thing inside her\\
186 - is dust and undigested mastodon meat.\\
187 - She isn't that old, Charlie.\\
188 - Oh, come on, I'll bet she was an eyewitness\\
189 - to the birth of agriculture.\\
190 - Stop it.\\
191 - Her high school graduation picture's\\
192 - probably on a cave wall in France.\\
193 - Are you done?\\
194 - Mm...\\
195 - Her prom theme was "Fire."\\
196 - Charlie, I can't figure out how to turn off the shower.\\
197 - There's so many knobs.\\
198 - That's okay, honey.\\
199 - You just dry off, and I'll take care of it.\\
200 - Thanks.\\
201 - How does it feel to be dating a woman\\
202 - whose IQ is the same as her age?\\
203 - I can ask you the same thing.\\
204 - Oh, here's something else we have in common.\\
205 - Both our girls are pruney,\\
206 - but mine's gonna plump back up in a little while.\\
207 - * Men...\\
208 - Well, thank you for a lovely evening.\\
209 - Oh, no, thank you for taking me.\\
210 - I so loathe going to these things by myself.\\
211 - And dancing.\\
212 - I can't remember the last time I danced.\\
213 - That was fun.\\
214 - One more spin?\\
215 - Okay, sure.\\
216 - ( Norma humming )\\
217 - ( laughing )\\
218 - Oh, thank you\\
219 - for being so kind to a lonely old gal.\\
220 - Stop saying that. You are not old.\\
221 - You're a vibrant, fascinating woman,\\
222 - and I had a great time with you tonight.\\
223 - Oh, likewise.\\
224 - Alan, I want you to give some serious thought to my offer.\\
225 - I will. I will.\\
226 - Okay, so, uh, so good night.\\
227 - Good night.\\
228 - Oh, all right.\\
229 - Morning.\\
230 - Morning.\\
231 - Who sent the flowers?\\
232 - I'll give you a hint.\\
233 - Wait 'til you see the card.\\
234 - You read the card?\\
235 - I couldn't. It's in Aramaic.\\
236 - Okay, I get it. She's old.\\
237 - It was delivered by a Roman centurion.\\
238 - Oh, geez. I've got a problem.\\
239 - Hey, if you got her pregnant,\\
240 - we can get a full page in Ripley's.\\
241 - Give it a rest, Charlie.\\
242 - Oh, come on, I've been working on these all morning.\\
243 - Listen to this.\\
244 - Her first car was a chariot.\\
245 - She called her first husband "hun" 'cause he was one.\\
246 - Her first Christmas\\
247 - was the first Christmas.\\
248 - Likes to take long walks on the beach\\
249 - after crawling out of the ocean and growing legs.\\
250 - Her birthstone is lava.\\
251 - And finally, the Big Bang.\\
252 - I don't have a joke for that yet,\\
253 - but I know there's something there.\\
254 - I'm leaving.\\
255 - Oh, come on, I'm your brother.\\
256 - You can talk to me.\\
257 - Okay, I promise, no more jokes.\\
258 - Tell me what the problem is.\\
259 - Okay.\\
260 - You know she's rich, right?\\
261 - Richer than God.\\
262 - Who she's known\\
263 - since he was yay high.\\
264 - You promised.\\
265 - Sorry. Yeah, yeah.\\
266 - Well, last night, Norma made me a business proposition.\\
267 - A business proposition? I bet it involved...\\
268 - No! No! No!\\
269 - No telegraphs, no flying machines,\\
270 - no Nina, no Pinta, no Santa Maria!\\
271 - You don't have to bite my head off.\\
272 - I was talking about what I do for a living,\\
273 - and she said she wanted to invest... in me.\\
274 - Invest in you? How?\\
275 - She wants to buy a building\\
276 - and create the Alan Harper Healing Center.\\
277 - Uh, chiropractic, acupuncture,\\
278 - uh, holistic pharmacy, aroma therapy...\\
279 - Why don't you just call it the Alan Harper House o' Crap?\\
280 - Norma chose the name.\\
281 - I see.\\
282 - And in exchange for all this, she expects you to...\\
283 - Well, nothing has been said explicitly, but... yeah.\\
284 - And you're considering it?\\
285 - No. No, of course not.\\
286 - Not really.\\
287 - Not really?\\
288 - Well, the building would be in Beverly Hills\\
289 - and it would have my name on the top.\\
290 - Big letters, but, you know, with a real classy font.\\
291 - I'm thinking Helvetica.\\
292 - Okay, I see your dilemma.\\
293 - We gotta think this through.\\
294 - Thanks, thanks. I really need to.\\
295 - You'd do her for free\\
296 - if she was young and beautiful, right?\\
297 - Well, sure, I suppose.\\
298 - And you'd stick your dingus in a beehive for, say,\\
299 - a hundred million, wouldn't you?\\
300 - A hundred million dollars?\\
301 - Probably.\\
302 - But where are we going with this?\\
303 - Well, we've established that you're a man whore,\\
304 - and now we're just trying to zero in on your price.\\
305 - Charlie, you're not helping at all.\\
306 - Alan, did you really think I would?\\
307 - * Men.\\
308 - Good to see you again, Ms. Seabury.\\
309 - Thank you, Bobby.\\
310 - My pleasure.\\
311 - Thank you.\\
312 - Good luck.\\
313 - Go away, Bobby.\\
314 - So, Alan...\\
315 - have you given any more thought\\
316 - to my little business proposal?\\
317 - Well, actually, I have and, uh...\\
318 - Oh, wait, I forgot.\\
319 - I brought you a little gifty.\\
320 - Oh, no, Norma, please, you've been too kind already.\\
321 - Oh, my God, a Rolex.\\
322 - It's a platinum Rolex.\\
323 - A platinum Rolex.\\
324 - I have always wanted a platinum Rolex.\\
325 - I almost bought one for myself, but silly me,\\
326 - I got health insurance for my family instead.\\
327 - Let me put it on you.\\
328 - Okay. Ooh.\\
329 - It's a lot heavier than my calculator Swatch.\\
330 - I'm glad you like it.\\
331 - Champagne for madame and her... special friend.\\
332 - Hey, Bobby, look.\\
333 - Very nice, sir.\\
334 - Oh...\\
335 - This is too much.\\
336 - I-I-I-I can't accept this.\\
337 - Oh, I think you can.\\
338 - Yeah, I probably can.\\
339 - A toast.\\
340 - To the Alan Harper Healing Center.\\
341 - Okay.\\
342 - And to us.\\
343 - Uh...\\
344 - to us as business partners and friends, right?\\
345 - Wrong.\\
346 - Oh.\\
347 - Alan?\\
348 - What?\\
349 - I've proposed a toast.\\
350 - Oh, yes. I'm sorry.\\
351 - It's just, this is all happening so fast.\\
352 - Yes, well, the heart wants what the heart wants.\\
353 - The question is, Alan...\\
354 - what do you want?\\
355 - ( loud ticking )\\
356 - Hurry up, sugar-buns.\\
357 - I'm not getting any younger.\\
358 - * Men.\\
359 - Charlie... wake up.\\
360 - What?\\
361 - What's wrong?\\
362 - I had sex with Norma.\\
363 - What?\\
364 - I gave in. I folded.\\
365 - I let her have her way with me.\\
366 - How was it?\\
367 - Actually, it was great.\\
368 - She... knew stuff.\\
369 - Is that a Rolex?\\
370 - Yeah. Platinum.\\
371 - Nice.\\
372 - And you're gonna get a building in Beverly Hills.\\
373 - Not bad for a night's work.\\
374 - Well, actually, I don't think\\
375 - I'm gonna be getting the building.\\
376 - She reneged?\\
377 - She... died.\\
378 - You're kidding.\\
379 - After we were done, she looked at me,\\
380 - mumbled a couple of words,\\
381 - closed her eyes and then... poof.\\
382 - Dead.\\
383 - That's it.\\
384 - I knew there was a Big Bang joke.\\
385 - I mean, I'm sorry.\\
386 - I just can't believe it.\\
387 - Me neither.\\
388 - After all those years of making me miserable,\\
389 - she's actually gone.\\
390 - It's weird, I feel a little sad.\\
391 - Imagine how I feel.\\
392 - Yeah, you killed her.\\
393 - So what did she mumble before she, you know...?\\
394 - Well, I'm not sure,\\
395 - but I think she said...\\
396 - "I want my watch back."\\
397 - Hey, I tried my best to keep up with her.\\
398 - Anyway, I've been up half the night\\
399 - with the police and the coroners.\\
400 - You have no idea how judgmental those people are.\\
401 - You can't worry about what anyone else thinks, Alan.\\
402 - The thing you got to remember\\
403 - and keep close to your heart is...\\
404 - I get an extra parking space and you get to keep the watch.\\
405 - Enjoy it, buddy.\\
406 - How can I enjoy it?\\
407 - Same way I enjoy that grand piano downstairs.\\
408 - What does the piano have any...?\\
409 - Wait a minute.\\
410 - Are you saying that you slept with Norma?\\
411 - Hey, I needed a piano.\\
412 - So... so if you slept with Norma,\\
413 - why did she hate you so much?\\
414 - Probably because I only needed one piano.\\
415 - You're right, though.\\
416 - She did know stuff.\\
417 - * Men.\\
418 - Hey, can you put on channel 84?\\
419 - I want to watch Reverend Don.\\
420 - Well, I want to watch football.\\
421 - It's the Lord's day.\\
422 - Yeah, but it's my TV.\\
423 - Who'd you bet on?\\
424 - Packers, minus one and a half.\\
425 - If the Vikings don't score\\
426 - in the next two minutes, I'm up a grand.\\
427 - Okay.\\
428 - What are you doing?\\
429 - Praying for the Vikings to score.\\
430 - Don't do that. Are you crazy?\\
431 - Change the channel to Reverend Don.\\
432 - No!\\
433 - Then you leave me no choice.\\
434 - Okay, you want to play that way? Fine.\\
435 - It won't work.\\
436 - God answers kids' prayers first.\\
437 - Who told you that?\\
438 - Nobody. It just makes sense.\\
439 - ANNOUNCER: That last drive put the Vikings in field goal range.\\
440 - Oh, God, oh, God...\\
441 - Too little, too late.\\
442 - Here comes the Vikings kicking unit out onto the field.\\
443 - Okay, tell you what.\\
444 - Pray for my side, I'll give you a piece of my winnings.\\
445 - How much? Five percent.\\
446 - No deal.\\
447 - Edinger has yet to miss from this distance.\\
448 - Okay, ten. Twenty.\\
449 - Twenty?\\
450 - And there's the snap... Deal.\\
451 - The kick is up. It's good!\\
452 - Oh, no!\\
453 - Don't blame me. You're a sinner.
\subsection {Episode 10: Something Salted and Twisted}
1 - Pretty fancy prices here.\\
2 - Yeah, well, just so we're clear,\\
3 - I'm picking up the tab tonight.\\
4 - Okay.\\
5 - This is my celebration. I invited you.\\
6 - Fine.\\
7 - So don't go grabbing the check.\\
8 - I won't touch the check.\\
9 - I mean, if you want to leave the tip\\
10 - that would be all right.\\
11 - I could do that.\\
12 - I usually leave 15%, but if you want to leave 20...\\
13 - that's your call.\\
14 - Thank you.\\
15 - Unless you think it's easier\\
16 - if we just split the check.\\
17 - Whatever.\\
18 - Of course, in many families\\
19 - if someone is celebrating some good news,\\
20 - his brother would insist on buying dinner.\\
21 - Then why don't I do that.\\
22 - But I'll leave the tip.\\
23 - One question.\\
24 - What?\\
25 - Do you have any money?\\
26 - No.\\
27 - I left my wallet at home.\\
28 - You mean this wallet?\\
29 - Oh, good, you found it.\\
30 - I was looking all over.\\
31 - So, uh... where did we leave things?\\
32 - You're paying, we're splitting?\\
33 - Oh, just shut up.\\
34 - So anyway, what's this good news you're celebrating?\\
35 - It's a surprise.\\
36 - I want to wait till Mom gets here.\\
37 - Yes, Jake, we see the spoon on your nose.\\
38 - Now stop it.\\
39 - Can you do it?\\
40 - I don't want to do it.\\
41 - Now behave yourself.\\
42 - Oh, work with me.\\
43 - Just wonderful.\\
44 - You pick a restaurant that has no valet.\\
45 - I had to park three blocks away\\
46 - and then schlep here in shoes that are not made for walking.\\
47 - I've got a blister the size of a communion wafer,\\
48 - and if Mommy doesn't get something to drink immediately,\\
49 - things are going to get very ugly.\\
50 - Let the celebration begin.\\
51 - Maybe the lesson here, Mom,\\
52 - is to buy shoes that are made for walking.\\
53 - Is it just me?\\
54 - In a perfect world it would be.\\
55 - Well, anyway, I'm here.\\
56 - So what's your big announcement, Alan?\\
57 - Jake, get that spoon off your nose.\\
58 - You don't know where it's been.\\
59 - It's been on my nose.\\
60 - You really must start looking at trade schools for the boy.\\
61 - Now that we are all here,\\
62 - I have some good news to share.\\
63 - This is not going to be out on the newsstands\\
64 - for a couple of days, but I have an advance copy.\\
65 - "Good doctor, good neighbor, good guy."\\
66 - Good God.\\
67 - Hey, Dad, you're famous.\\
68 - Well, not really.\\
69 - Well, among the readers of the Tarzana Pennysaver\\
70 - maybe a little.\\
71 - Don't forget the homeless people who make underpants out of it.\\
72 - Charlie, don't be disrespectful.\\
73 - Thank you, Mom.\\
74 - So how much advertising did you have to buy\\
75 - in exchange for this puff piece?\\
76 - Why do you assume that I had to buy advertising?\\
77 - Is it that hard to believe that a local newspaper\\
78 - might run a cover story\\
79 - about a successful local chiropractor?\\
80 - Well, frankly, yes.\\
81 - Unless the local chiropractor shot four people to death\\
82 - in a mini-mart and then turned the weapon on himself.\\
83 - You know, I get why Charlie\\
84 - has never been able to acknowledge my accomplishments.\\
85 - He's a self-centered hedonist\\
86 - who can't get behind anyone\\
87 - unless they're drunk and bent over a pool table.\\
88 - That's fair.\\
89 - But my own mother...\\
90 - You're... up.\\
91 - Refusing to even feign interest.\\
92 - I did so feign interest.\\
93 - You assumed that I had to buy advertising\\
94 - to get the article.\\
95 - Well, did you?\\
96 - Neighborhood advertising is a good investment.\\
97 - But that is not the point.\\
98 - All right, dear, what is the point?\\
99 - The point is I can't even get a simple "attaboy"\\
100 - from my own mother.\\
101 - Oh, well, I'm sorry.\\
102 - ( clearing throat )\\
103 - Attaboy.\\
104 - Feel better?\\
105 - No, I do not feel better.\\
106 - Did I not say it right?\\
107 - You know what?\\
108 - Forget it.\\
109 - Let's just order, eat and get out of here.\\
110 - Oh, one more of these and please keep them coming.\\
111 - I'll buy the drinks.\\
112 - Unless you want to split it with me.\\
113 - *Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * *Oh.\\
114 - No, Alan, what else?\\
115 - I cannot believe that our mother made us carry her to her car,\\
116 - just because she had a teeny-weeny little blister on her foot.\\
117 - Well, hopefully the next time we have to carry her,\\
118 - she'll be in a handy urn.\\
119 - Oh, oh...\\
120 - I'll pay for the urn if you'll get the cremation.\\
121 - Done.\\
122 - Jake? Where's my son?\\
123 - Right here, Dad.\\
124 - Oh, oh, good.\\
125 - Uh, now listen, boy,\\
126 - your old dad is not going to be here for...\\
127 - Whee.\\
128 - He's not going to be here forever.\\
129 - And... and when I'm gone,\\
130 - I want there to be no doubt in your mind\\
131 - that I was as proud as punch\\
132 - about all of your\\
133 - accomplishments.\\
134 - No matter how minuscule.\\
135 - Boy, you're really plowed, aren't you?\\
136 - No. Your daddy doesn't get plowed.\\
137 - He just gets a little bzzz.\\
138 - Bzzz.\\
139 - Anyway,\\
140 - the important thing for you to know\\
141 - is how much I love you.\\
142 - You told the waiter you loved him, too.\\
143 - He was a very good waiter.\\
144 - And it's also important for you to know\\
145 - that you can be anything you want.\\
146 - Anything in the world.\\
147 - No, I can't.\\
148 - You're right. That's a crock.\\
149 - But I love you...\\
150 - And you have cheeks like a beaver.\\
151 - Now go to bed.\\
152 - You know, Dad, we've been learning about alcohol abuse\\
153 - at school, and if you ever need a new liver\\
154 - you can have half of mine.\\
155 - Hey, hey, hey, hey, I thought we had a deal.\\
156 - Oh, yeah. Sorry, Dad.\\
157 - Best five bucks I ever spent.\\
158 - Now come on, let's tuck you into bed.\\
159 - Why can't my mother appreciate me?\\
160 - All I wanted was once sincere "attaboy."\\
161 - Is that too much to ask?\\
162 - ( retching )\\
163 - Attaboy.\\
164 - Well, that looks like the last of the scallops.\\
165 - Now all we got to do is wait for dessert.\\
166 - Rainbow sherbet.\\
167 - Oh, that should be pretty.\\
168 - You know, I have spent my entire life\\
169 - trying to please Mom, to make her proud of me,\\
170 - but no more.\\
171 - I... I am done trying.\\
172 - Good for you.\\
173 - Oh, uh, excuse me.\\
174 - Nope.\\
175 - You know, if you put the seat down,\\
176 - it's easier to rest your arms.\\
177 - Oh, you're right.\\
178 - You are a wise man, Charlie Harper.\\
179 - I do a have few pockets of specialized knowledge.\\
180 - Some might call it wisdom.\\
181 - And it seems warmer, too.\\
182 - You're further away from the cooling effect of the water.\\
183 - Not to mention the residual body heat\\
184 - accrued from thousands of ass-hours.\\
185 - Wow, you've really given a lot of thought to this.\\
186 - I'm thinking of writing a book.\\
187 - And I will read it.\\
188 - Thank you.\\
189 - You know what I am, Charlie?\\
190 - Yes.\\
191 - I'm a pathological people pleaser.\\
192 - Huh. I had an entirely different answer.\\
193 - But more accurately, I... I am a woman pleaser.\\
194 - No, Alan, I am a woman pleaser.\\
195 - You're a lonely guy speckled with vomit.\\
196 - I-I-I'm not speaking physically,\\
197 - I'm speaking psycholog... logically.\\
198 - With Mom,\\
199 - with Judith...\\
200 - with every woman I've ever met.\\
201 - I have twisted myself in knots\\
202 - just trying to get them to like me.\\
203 - My... my... my education, my... my job,\\
204 - my clothes, my car...\\
205 - my very behavior, all chosen\\
206 - simply to get women to approve of me.\\
207 - And how's that worked out for you?\\
208 - They don't approve of me.\\
209 - But I am going to change, Charlie.\\
210 - I am no longer going to grovel for Mom's approval\\
211 - or the approval of any-any woman.\\
212 - I am going to live\\
213 - the remainder of my life with pride\\
214 - and, and a quiet, noble dignity.\\
215 - But first I'll sleep with my head in the crapper.\\
216 - ( toilet flushing )\\
217 - ( noisy chewing )\\
218 - Can I make you some oatmeal?\\
219 - I've got cereal.\\
220 - I know.\\
221 - I just thought you might enjoy something hot...\\
222 - and quiet.\\
223 - No.\\
224 - ( chewing resumes )\\
225 - Do you have a hangover?\\
226 - Yeah.\\
227 - Drinking that much was a stupid thing to do.\\
228 - Then why did you do it?\\
229 - I don't know, Jake.\\
230 - Maybe I'm just stupid.\\
231 - Or maybe you just don't apply yourself.\\
232 - Will you stop talking for a while?\\
233 - Okay.\\
234 - ( loud crunching )\\
235 - Although I do like a little conversation at breakfast.\\
236 - Morning, everybody.\\
237 - Shh. He's hung over.\\
238 - Oh, yeah.\\
239 - Well, isn't this an ironic turn of events.\\
240 - Me waking up feeling all bright and chipper,\\
241 - and you... looking like a stool sample.\\
242 - Not a big irony fan, huh?\\
243 - Charlie?\\
244 - Yeah?\\
245 - Either stop talking\\
246 - or at least have the decency to kill me.\\
247 - Boy,\\
248 - I'm never gonna drink.\\
249 - Good job.\\
250 - You scarred the kid for life.\\
251 - Now he's gonna face junior high sober.\\
252 - Just-just tell me one thing.\\
253 - What's that?\\
254 - Did I really tell the waiter I loved him last night?\\
255 - You had to say something after a kiss like that.\\
256 - I took care of your bathroom.\\
257 - Thank you.\\
258 - I hope you like the smell of pine-scented puke.\\
259 - So, did I do anything else I'm gonna regret?\\
260 - Well, you paid for dinner.\\
261 - Aw, geez!\\
262 - And after we got home, there was some drunken blubbering\\
263 - about how you weren't gonna grovel for the approval of women anymore.\\
264 - Oh, right. I almost forgot.\\
265 - I-I had a life-changing epiphany last night.\\
266 - Was this before or after\\
267 - you yanked up a hunk of your esophagus?\\
268 - No, it's no joke.\\
269 - I reached a turning point.\\
270 - From this day on, my actions will no longer be predicated\\
271 - on pleasing the castrating mother figures in my life.\\
272 - ( chuckling )\\
273 - Wha-What's so funny?\\
274 - Nothing. ( chuckling )\\
275 - I think she doubts your epiphany.\\
276 - She'll see.\\
277 - They'll all see.\\
278 - Starting now, I am new Alan.\\
279 - ( Berta cackling )\\
280 - Starting now, I will fear no women's disapproval.\\
281 - ( doorbell rings ) Oh, God, that's Judith.\\
282 - I was supposed to have Jake ready.\\
283 - She's gonna kill me!\\
284 - Okay, starting now.\\
285 - Good for you.\\
286 - ( doorbell rings ) Oh, I better get that.\\
287 - Let her wait. What she thinks of you doesn't matter.\\
288 - The only thing that counts is what you think of you.\\
289 - You're right.\\
290 - It's what I think of me.\\
291 - And?\\
292 - I had so much potential.\\
293 - You can forget what you think of you.\\
294 - Yeah, I'm probably too close to me\\
295 - to see me clearly. Yeah, that's it.\\
296 - Oh, do I smell like vomit?\\
297 - Don't worry. I'll stand next to you.\\
298 - She'll assume it's me.\\
299 - Good. Good.\\
300 - Hi, Alan. Jake ready?\\
301 - No, he is not.\\
302 - You said you'd have him ready.\\
303 - Well, I don't.\\
304 - And if that makes you unhappy with me,\\
305 - well, I don't give a rat's furry ass.\\
306 - What did you just say to me?\\
307 - Nothing. I'm sorry. Jake?\\
308 - Starting now? Starting soon.\\
309 - You know what that smell is?\\
310 - Epiphany... for men.\\
311 - So, how long you been in Los Angeles?\\
312 - About eight months.\\
313 - Haven't got a single audition yet.\\
314 - Yeah, this can be a tough town if you don't know anybody.\\
315 - ( long sigh )\\
316 - Do you have, like, a head shot or a resume?\\
317 - ( long sigh )\\
318 - Is he okay?\\
319 - I don't know.\\
320 - Sir, are you okay?\\
321 - I thought we came here to talk.\\
322 - Not to each other.\\
323 - ( groans )\\
324 - All right, let's talk. What's bothering you?\\
325 - I changed my mind. I don't want to talk about it. Talk or die.\\
326 - All right. I'm depressed.\\
327 - I want to change, but-but I can't.\\
328 - Whenever I'm confronted by a disapproving woman,\\
329 - something inside me just crumbles.\\
330 - Well, I don't know. Maybe that's just who you are.\\
331 - You know? Fish got to swim, birds got to fly,\\
332 - you got to crumble.\\
333 - What I don't understand is that I can intellectually see\\
334 - the problem, but I just can't do anything about it.\\
335 - Oh, excuse me, miss, can I have more of these little pretzels, please?\\
336 - In a minute.\\
337 - Okay, sorry, no hurry.\\
338 - Look, it's very simple.\\
339 - You were conditioned as a child to seek Mom's approval.\\
340 - You're still seeking Mom's approval,\\
341 - and you make every woman in the world a substitute mom.\\
342 - But what about you? We had the same mother.\\
343 - Well, I handle my conditioning in a different way.\\
344 - I have casual and often degrading sex with my substitute moms,\\
345 - but we're talking about you and not me, so forget I said that.\\
346 - Oh, how I'll try.\\
347 - But-but how do you deal with the fear of disapproval?\\
348 - I mean, you must get shot down occasionally.\\
349 - Occasionally? Constantly.\\
350 - Constantly?\\
351 - Occasionally.\\
352 - It's a numbers game, Alan.\\
353 - We all want the shiny apple on top of the tree.\\
354 - But sometimes you got to settle for one on a lower branch.\\
355 - And, of course, there's times when you just got to...\\
356 - pick up whatever's lying on the ground\\
357 - and put it in your mouth.\\
358 - But how do you manage to keep going on\\
359 - in the face of constant rejection?\\
360 - Occasional rejection.\\
361 - Okay, lesson one.\\
362 - Look around.\\
363 - Out of all the women here, which one do you find the most attractive?\\
364 - Let's see, um...\\
365 - ALAN: Her.\\
366 - CHARLIE: The brunette? Why?\\
367 - I don't know. There's just something about her.\\
368 - CHARLIE: Yeah.\\
369 - Radiating waves of contempt.\\
370 - You asked me who I found attractive.\\
371 - That's true. That's true.\\
372 - All right, she's your shiny apple.\\
373 - Now, go ask her if you can buy her a drink.\\
374 - What about the radiating waves of contempt?\\
375 - That's just a defense mechanism for a little girl in a lot of pain.\\
376 - Really? How the hell should I know?\\
377 - The point is, you can't let fear stand in your way.\\
378 - Well, I disagree.\\
379 - Are you questioning my methods?\\
380 - 'Cause we can stop right now.\\
381 - No, no, I'll do it, I'll do it.\\
382 - Would you like some more pretzels?\\
383 - Well, I am in the mood for something salty and twisted.\\
384 - ( laughs ): You're terrible.\\
385 - You have no idea.\\
386 - How'd it go?\\
387 - She's really got a mouth on her.\\
388 - So she rejected you.\\
389 - With anatomical specificity.\\
390 - Good.\\
391 - Good? How is that good?\\
392 - How do you feel right now?\\
393 - What do you mean, how do I feel? I feel humiliated.\\
394 - Where? What?\\
395 - Where is the humiliation? Where do you feel it?\\
396 - Well, let's see, my...\\
397 - Well, my stomach's all knotted. My heart is pounding.\\
398 - I'm sweating like a pig.\\
399 - Okay. End of lesson one.\\
400 - That was lesson one?\\
401 - Lesson one sucked.\\
402 - Lesson two.\\
403 - Have a drink.\\
404 - No, sweetheart, have a real drink.\\
405 - I don't like scotch.\\
406 - That's okay. It's bourbon.\\
407 - Oh. All right.\\
408 - Yecch!\\
409 - More.\\
410 - How do you feel now?\\
411 - I feel a little better.\\
412 - Finish the drink.\\
413 - Can I put some Diet Sprite in it?\\
414 - Just finish it.\\
415 - There you go.\\
416 - Now how do you feel?\\
417 - ( gasping )\\
418 - I feel pretty good.\\
419 - Like, you know, to hell with her.\\
420 - Who cares what she thinks?\\
421 - Perfect. Now, go ask that chick over there\\
422 - if you can buy her a drink.\\
423 - Wait a minute.\\
424 - Wait a minute. That's your big secret? Alcohol?\\
425 - Shh. Don't tell anybody.\\
426 - But isn't that just a temporary solution?\\
427 - It's only temporary if you stop drinking.\\
428 - I like it!\\
429 - Diet Sprite.\\
430 - ( retching )\\
431 - I got to hand it to you, Alan.\\
432 - Most guys would be off scallops for a long time.\\
433 - I like scallops.\\
434 - Clearly, they don't like you.\\
435 - I guess you choose your seafood like you choose your women.\\
436 - I beg to differ.\\
437 - When it comes to women, I make them sick.\\
438 - Fair enough.\\
439 - So, what else did we learn tonight?\\
440 - Well, let-let's see.\\
441 - I learned that-that to overcome my fear of rejection\\
442 - ingrained in me by an emotionally distant mother,\\
443 - I need to completely disable my central nervous system\\
444 - with semi-lethal quantities of alcohol.\\
445 - Bravo!\\
446 - Hey, Charlie, you coming to bed or what?\\
447 - I'll be there in a second.\\
448 - What are you looking at?\\
449 - Sorry, very sorry.\\
450 - So, how have you been?\\
451 - It worked!\\
452 - I am totally humiliated, and I don't care.\\
453 - You made real progress tonight, Alan,\\
454 - and I'm proud of you. Thanks, Charlie.\\
455 - You're-you're a good teacher.\\
456 - And-and a good brother.\\
457 - Thanks.\\
458 - Well...\\
459 - I guess it's time for me to go work out my issues.\\
460 - ( toilet flushes )\\
461 - Good night, pal.\\
462 - Nighty-night.\\
463 - * Men...
\subsection {Episode 11: Santa's Village of the Damned}
1 - Uh-oh.\\
2 - Good morning.\\
3 - Morning.\\
4 - Charlie, right?\\
5 - Well, I guess it's too late to deny it.\\
6 - Would you like some coffee?\\
7 - Uh... sure.\\
8 - I would.\\
9 - You have a beautiful house.\\
10 - Thank you...\\
11 - so much.\\
12 - My name is Sandy.\\
13 - Oh, yes... of course it is.\\
14 - How could I forget?\\
15 - Sandy like the beach or the... Koufax.\\
16 - Pardon me?\\
17 - You know, Sandy Koufax... great Dodger pitcher,\\
18 - Hall of Famer, never mind.\\
19 - So, Sandy... how'd you... sleep?\\
20 - Oh, just fine.\\
21 - How about you?\\
22 - Great. Like a drunk baby.\\
23 - Are you hungry?\\
24 - Not yet. Maybe after I throw up.\\
25 - What did you do last night?\\
26 - Actually, I was hoping you could fill me in.\\
27 - There's my little Sandy beach.\\
28 - Good morning, Alley-Oop.\\
29 - Oh, thank God.\\
30 - I was afraid I was gonna have to quit drinking.\\
31 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
32 - *Ooh * Men *\\
33 - So, what do you think of Sandy?\\
34 - Arguably the greatest southpaw in the history of baseball.\\
35 - My Sandy.\\
36 - I don't know. I've never seen her pitch.\\
37 - She sure can cook.\\
38 - Well, guess how we met.\\
39 - I suppose we can rule out Dodger Stadium.\\
40 - In cooking class.\\
41 - You've been taking a cooking class?\\
42 - Where do you think I go every Tuesday night?\\
43 - You're not here on Tuesday nights?\\
44 - No.\\
45 - I'm in cooking class.\\
46 - And guess who's the teacher.\\
47 - Who?\\
48 - Sandy.\\
49 - Oh.\\
50 - Who's Sandy?\\
51 - That's Sandy.\\
52 - Oh.\\
53 - Great story.\\
54 - Alan is my star pupil.\\
55 - And you are my star teacher.\\
56 - ( both giggling )\\
57 - Yo.\\
58 - Can I have some more bacon?\\
59 - Oh. In a jiff.\\
60 - My mother always said, "A well-fed man is a happy man."\\
61 - Our mother always said, "Here's ten bucks for pizza.\\
62 - Don't wait up."\\
63 - That reminds me, she called and invited us for Christmas.\\
64 - You told her yes, right? Absolutely.\\
65 - I thought you and I were going to spend Christmas together.\\
66 - We are.\\
67 - But you're going to your mother's.\\
68 - What gave you that idea?\\
69 - You see, Sandy, it's kind of a family tradition.\\
70 - Every year, our mother invites us,\\
71 - even though she doesn't want us to come.\\
72 - We say yes, even though we don't want to go.\\
73 - Then, when we don't show up, even though she's relieved,\\
74 - she gets to complain to her friends\\
75 - about what horrible children she has.\\
76 - It's the perfect gift.\\
77 - But Christmas is supposed to be\\
78 - about spending time with your loved ones.\\
79 - Yeah, and going to our mother's would cut into that.\\
80 - This way, Alan gets to spend it with his son,\\
81 - and I get to play stuff the stocking in Vegas\\
82 - with a couple of saline-enhanced elves.\\
83 - Does this mean that I'm finally going to meet your son?\\
84 - I guess it does.\\
85 - Gosh, I so hope he likes me.\\
86 - The way you cook, your only problem's gonna be\\
87 - keeping him from humping your leg.\\
88 - ( buzzing )\\
89 - Oh, that's the sheets.\\
90 - If you fold them while they're warm, they don't wrinkle.\\
91 - Huh?\\
92 - Huh?\\
93 - Beauty, sex, cooking, laundry.\\
94 - Marriage, boredom, alimony, death.\\
95 - You are such a cynic.\\
96 - And you are such a sap.\\
97 - How am I a sap?\\
98 - Are you blind?\\
99 - She's a nester.\\
100 - What's that supposed to mean?\\
101 - It means she throws you some tail,\\
102 - a couple pieces of bacon, and bibbity-bobbity-boo,\\
103 - you've got a roommate.\\
104 - Bibbity-bobbity-boo?\\
105 - Isn't that from Cinderella?\\
106 - You don't think that bitch was a nester?\\
107 - I find that just a couple of drops of lemon juice\\
108 - on the dryer sheet really freshens up the whole load.\\
109 - Really?\\
110 - I find that just a couple Valiums in my coffee\\
111 - keeps me from snapping necks.\\
112 - Well, um, hold this, please.\\
113 - I'm just going to pop these on the bed\\
114 - while they're still warm and toasty.\\
115 - So which one of you guys\\
116 - is slipping the high hard one to Martha Stewart?\\
117 - Hey, Brandi, it's Charlie Harper.\\
118 - Listen, I'm coming back to Vegas for Christmas,\\
119 - and I was wondering if you and your sister\\
120 - wanted to celebrate the holidays again.\\
121 - Harper.\\
122 - Oh, wait.\\
123 - It's possible that you remember me as Dr. Philip Gonzalez.\\
124 - Right.\\
125 - Yeah.\\
126 - Hola.\\
127 - Anyway, I'm sitting here making vacation plans,\\
128 - and I'm thinking where better to commemorate\\
129 - the birth of our Lord than Caesar's Palace?\\
130 - Hey, Charlie.\\
131 - Hungry?\\
132 - Hold on, Brandi.\\
133 - Not really, but listen, Sandy...\\
134 - Now last chance.\\
135 - I'm gonna start dinner, so the kitchen's gonna be\\
136 - off limits for a while.\\
137 - But it's my kitchen.\\
138 - So?\\
139 - I just thought it was important to point out.\\
140 - You're so cute.\\
141 - Look, Brandi, talk to your sister, work up an estimate,\\
142 - and I'll call you back.\\
143 - SANDY: I've got a surprise for you.\\
144 - A mini-blind brush.\\
145 - BERTA: A what?\\
146 - SANDY: I don't think Alan's blinds have been dusted in months,\\
147 - but that's probably because you didn't have the proper tool.\\
148 - BERTA: Gee, thanks.\\
149 - We got to talk.\\
150 - I'm on it. You better be or else she's gonna be on it.\\
151 - Because now I have the proper tool.\\
152 - Listen, Sandy...\\
153 - You had your chance, Charlie.\\
154 - If you're hungry, take a pudding cup.\\
155 - I don't want a pudding cup.\\
156 - We need to establish a few ground rules.\\
157 - Oh, okay.\\
158 - I'm listening.\\
159 - Okay, well, first of all,\\
160 - Berta's been with me for a long time.\\
161 - And what she lacks in housekeeping skills,\\
162 - she more than makes up for in upper body strength.\\
163 - What's that?\\
164 - Rack of lamb.\\
165 - Really? Mm-hmm.\\
166 - You're making that for us?\\
167 - Yep.\\
168 - With roasted baby potatoes and caramelized carrots.\\
169 - Ooh.\\
170 - Anyway, anyway...\\
171 - Ground rules.\\
172 - Now I want to be supportive of you and Alan...\\
173 - Oh, I'm sorry, one quick question.\\
174 - Chocolate or raspberry souffl  ?\\
175 - It doesn't matter.\\
176 - The point is... I'll just make raspberry.\\
177 - Actually, I prefer chocolate.\\
178 - Chocolate it is.\\
179 - Now why don't I mix you up a little cocktail\\
180 - and you can take a nap before dinner.\\
181 - A nap would be nice.\\
182 - Can I still have the pudding cup?\\
183 - Okay.\\
184 - But just one.\\
185 - I don't want you spoiling your appetite before dinner.\\
186 - Thank you.\\
187 - Well?\\
188 - Good news.\\
189 - We're having rack of lamb for dinner.\\
190 - ALAN: Oh, no.\\
191 - I'm hungry.\\
192 - Where's Sandy?\\
193 - She went to get a honey-baked ham for Christmas Eve dinner.\\
194 - Ooh, honey-baked ham.\\
195 - Yay!\\
196 - I find it a little ironic that despite all your warnings\\
197 - about her nesting instincts,\\
198 - you haven't missed a single one of her meals.\\
199 - Yeah, I'm a master of irony.\\
200 - Hey, I thought you were going to Vegas for Christmas.\\
201 - Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?\\
202 - Then you'd have the whole ham to yourself.\\
203 - You should talk, Porky.\\
204 - Who took the leftover lasagna under the deck\\
205 - so that we wouldn't see him eat it all himself?\\
206 - Who made a meatloaf sandwich by taking a slice of meatloaf\\
207 - and putting it between two other slices of meatloaf?\\
208 - I am cutting down on carbs.\\
209 - Yeah, it's working for you.\\
210 - When's the last time you looked down in the shower\\
211 - and saw your testicles?\\
212 - I don't need to see them.\\
213 - I know they're there.\\
214 - And what about you?\\
215 - What do you call this?\\
216 - Goodyear or Pirelli?\\
217 - This, my chunky friend, is water weight.\\
218 - Water weight?\\
219 - It's genetic. I retain water.\\
220 - You also retain German chocolate cake,\\
221 - lamb stew and Belgian waffles.\\
222 - Hey, people who live in fat asses shouldn't throw waffles.\\
223 - Don't talk about my ass.\\
224 - I am very self-conscious about my ass.\\
225 - I'm sorry.\\
226 - I'm just lashing out 'cause I haven't eaten in 75 minutes.\\
227 - You want some of Sandy's homemade fudge?\\
228 - Don't play with me, Alan.\\
229 - You've got fudge up here?\\
230 - Close your eyes.\\
231 - Okay.\\
232 - Mm... fudge.\\
233 - Aw.\\
234 - Oh, you know what would be great?\\
235 - Honey-baked fudge.\\
236 - Or fudge-covered ham.\\
237 - Mm... Mm...\\
238 - Well, I'm really happy that we get to spend Christmas together.\\
239 - We don't have to go to your mom's, do we?\\
240 - Don't be silly.\\
241 - Hey, you hungry?\\
242 - I could eat.\\
243 - Well, you're gonna.\\
244 - Can we order Chinese like we did last year?\\
245 - Oh, no, no. This year,\\
246 - we're gonna do something a little more traditional.\\
247 - Deli?\\
248 - No, we're gonna have a-a real, home-cooked Christmas dinner.\\
249 - Whose home?\\
250 - Our home.\\
251 - How?\\
252 - Well, I'm, uh, I'm dating a-a lady\\
253 - who's gonna make us a wonderful dinner.\\
254 - Oh, okay.\\
255 - Are you at all curious?\\
256 - Yeah, a little.\\
257 - Well, okay, you can, uh, ask me any question,\\
258 - and I'll try and answer it for you.\\
259 - What are we having?\\
260 - No, about the lady.\\
261 - Oh. No, not really.\\
262 - Well, I-I just want you to know\\
263 - that I-I really like her,\\
264 - and you're probably gonna be seeing her a lot.\\
265 - Do I have to like her?\\
266 - Well, of course not.\\
267 - Then I probably won't.\\
268 - Why would you say that?\\
269 - We're very different people, Dad.\\
270 - So true.\\
271 - Is she gonna be staying over?\\
272 - Yes.\\
273 - Where is she gonna sleep?\\
274 - In my room.\\
275 - Okay.\\
276 - Just remember, the walls are thin,\\
277 - and I'm impressionable.\\
278 - * Men.\\
279 - Hey, what are doing out here?\\
280 - I thought I should prepare you.\\
281 - For what?\\
282 - Alan,\\
283 - remember what I told you about nesters?\\
284 - Yeah.\\
285 - Well, some are hummingbirds,\\
286 - some are robins.\\
287 - But you my friend...\\
288 - You got yourself a partridge in a freakin' pear tree.\\
289 - Sandy did all this?\\
290 - Yup.\\
291 - I think it's cool.\\
292 - It's like an amusement park.\\
293 - Yeah, Six Flags Over Crazy-Ass Chick-land.\\
294 - This cannot be Jake.\\
295 - You're too grownup-looking.\\
296 - Yeah, thanks. Are those for anybody?\\
297 - Help yourselves.\\
298 - ( sniffing )\\
299 - ALL: Mmm, gingerbread.\\
300 - Jake, you can help me in the kitchen if you like.\\
301 - I'm making chocolate eclairs for dessert,\\
302 - and I need an official taster.\\
303 - I like her.\\
304 - Well, look at that.\\
305 - They're bonding already.\\
306 - Alan, your kid would join the Taliban\\
307 - if they made their own s'mores.\\
308 - So-So, when did she do all this decorating?\\
309 - Hard to say.\\
310 - Everything was normal up until lunchtime.\\
311 - Oh, I missed lunch.\\
312 - What did you have?\\
313 - She made me\\
314 - a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich... Oh!\\
315 - ...with garlic mayonnaise on sourdough toast.\\
316 - Oh! Damn!\\
317 - Anyway, after lunch, I took a little nap\\
318 - and woke up in Santa's village of the damned.\\
319 - Why do you have to be so cynical?\\
320 - There is nothing wrong with decorating your home\\
321 - to show a little holiday spirit.\\
322 - Aha!\\
323 - But it's not her home, is it?\\
324 - Well, no.\\
325 - Whose home is it, Alan?\\
326 - Okay, fine, I will have a talk with her.\\
327 - Hold it!\\
328 - What?\\
329 - After dinner, you nimrod.\\
330 - Anybody have room for another eclair?\\
331 - Not unless I unbutton my pants.\\
332 - Mine are already unbuttoned.\\
333 - I took mine off\\
334 - when she brought out the marshmallow yams.\\
335 - Okay, then.\\
336 - What do you say we all go into the living room\\
337 - and sing some Christmas carols?\\
338 - You mean stand up?\\
339 - I don't think I can.\\
340 - I'm not wearing pants.\\
341 - Come on, guys. What's Christmas without caroling?\\
342 - Chanukah?\\
343 - * Jingle bells, jingle bells\\
344 - * Jingle all the way\\
345 - * Oh, what fun it is to ride\\
346 - * In a one-horse open sleigh... *\\
347 - Hey.\\
348 - Sandy, something wrong?\\
349 - Who moved the reindeer?\\
350 - I don't know that one, but I'll wing it.\\
351 - ( to "Joy to the World" ): * Who moved the reindeer\\
352 - * The savior's come\\
353 - * He's coming to check on the reindeer... *\\
354 - No, no, no, no.\\
355 - These reindeer.\\
356 - What about them?\\
357 - Donner and Blitzen are out of order.\\
358 - Somebody's been playing with them.\\
359 - So?\\
360 - So, I want to know who it was.\\
361 - Jake?\\
362 - I didn't do it.\\
363 - Charlie?\\
364 - Oh all right. I may have used one of 'em as a swizzle stick.\\
365 - ( sighs )\\
366 - Well, no harm done.\\
367 - But if you must play with them, please remember,\\
368 - it's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen,\\
369 - Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen.\\
370 - Okay.\\
371 - Donner, Blitzen, Donner, Blitzen, Donner, Blitzen!\\
372 - Got it.\\
373 - Say it!\\
374 - Donner, Blitzen.\\
375 - Okay then.\\
376 - "The Little Drummer Boy."\\
377 - * Brrum, Brrum\\
378 - *Brrum, Brrum ( playing discordant note )\\
379 - * Come, they told me, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum *\\
380 - * A newborn king to see, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum *\\
381 - * The finest gifts we bring, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum *\\
382 - * To lay before the king, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum *\\
383 - * Rum-pa-pum-pum...\\
384 - Donner, Blitzen, Donner, Blitzen.\\
385 - Alan, why aren't you asleep?\\
386 - I don't know.\\
387 - Just excited about Christmas, I guess.\\
388 - Well, Santa won't come while you're awake.\\
389 - Yeah. Yeah, I've heard that.\\
390 - Now close your eyes, and let visions of sugarplums dance\\
391 - through your wee little head.\\
392 - Okay.\\
393 - ( gasps )\\
394 - Oh, no.\\
395 - What?\\
396 - I-I forgot to put out cookies and milk for Santa.\\
397 - Oh!\\
398 - You're kidding, right?\\
399 - Do you want coal in your stocking?\\
400 - Because that's what you're gonna get\\
401 - if Santa doesn't find a snack when he comes down the chimney.\\
402 - I see.\\
403 - So, you believe in the vengeful,\\
404 - Old Testament Santa.\\
405 - Are you mocking Christmas?\\
406 - Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no. You know what?\\
407 - Well, I'll just take care of the milk and cookies.\\
408 - You-You just relax and-and go to sleep.\\
409 - He sees us when we're sleeping, you know.\\
410 - Right.\\
411 - I don't make the rules.\\
412 - Okay.\\
413 - ( to "The First Noel" ): * Oh, God, Oh, God\\
414 - * Oh, God, Oh, God.\\
415 - Charlie?\\
416 - Hang on.\\
417 - ( toilet flushes )\\
418 - ( sighs )\\
419 - Okay, I'm ready for more pie.\\
420 - We have a serious problem here.\\
421 - We're out of pie?\\
422 - Will you listen to me?\\
423 - There's something wrong with Sandy.\\
424 - Well, didn't we know that\\
425 - when she agreed to sleep with you?\\
426 - No. Even wronger than that.\\
427 - She actually believes in Santa Claus.\\
428 - Really? Yeah.\\
429 - Wow.\\
430 - But we still have pie?\\
431 - Yes, we still have pie.\\
432 - Then what are we doin' up here?\\
433 - I guess I could have a little sliver.\\
434 - You know what?\\
435 - I think something's wrong with Sandy.\\
436 - I just said that.\\
437 - Do you ever listen to me?\\
438 - Sandy, sweetheart?\\
439 - You okay?\\
440 - He's not coming.\\
441 - Who's not coming?\\
442 - ( whispers ): Listen to this.\\
443 - Santa.\\
444 - Every year I try and make things perfect,\\
445 - and every year I fail.\\
446 - Mama was right.\\
447 - I am a naughty girl.\\
448 - Come on, Alan.\\
449 - Where we going?\\
450 - I want you to teach this naughty girl a lesson.\\
451 - She needs to be punished.\\
452 - You lucky dog.\\
453 - What? I'm not going in there.\\
454 - She's nuts.\\
455 - Yeah. So?\\
456 - Sex with crazy chicks is great.\\
457 - Just make sure you pick positions\\
458 - where you can see what her hands are doing.\\
459 - No, no. That would be taking advantage\\
460 - of a-a mentally unbalanced person.\\
461 - Oh, Alan, that boat has sailed.\\
462 - You might as well hop on board for a farewell cruise.\\
463 - I don't think so.\\
464 - It-It just wouldn't be right.\\
465 - SANDY: Come on, Alan.\\
466 - I'm ready.\\
467 - Good night.\\
468 - Okay.\\
469 - Pie for everybody.\\
470 - Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!\\
471 - Are you out of your mind?\\
472 - Mom, you've been naggin' us for years\\
473 - to spend Christmas with you.\\
474 - Only because I knew you'd never show up.\\
475 - Well, we had to get out of the house.\\
476 - Yeah. The walls are thin, and I'm impressionable.\\
477 - Hold on.\\
478 - Stanley, put your pants on.\\
479 - We'll exchange gifts later.\\
480 - Come on in.\\
481 - Dear God, look at the size of your ass!
\subsection {Episode 12: That Special Tug}
1 - I just want to be clear that I am here as a last resort.\\
2 - I understand.\\
3 - I don't have a lot of faith in psychiatry as a science.\\
4 - I think some of the drugs you're pushing are interesting...\\
5 - and I'm all for messing around with brain chemistry.\\
6 - I mean, that's how I got through high school.\\
7 - But in my experience,\\
8 - popping pills doesn't relieve social anxiety\\
9 - quite as well as, say, bourbon and Marvin Gaye.\\
10 - Now I get it.\\
11 - You're desperate and I'm full of hooey.\\
12 - So in the words of Marvin Gaye...\\
13 - "What's goin' on?"\\
14 - Everything I say is confidential, right?\\
15 - Whatever you say, stays in this room.\\
16 - Kind of like Vegas.\\
17 - Well, except there's no way you're leaving here\\
18 - with more money than when you came in.\\
19 - Yeah, like Vegas.\\
20 - Anyway...\\
21 - last night I'm out with my stupid, lame-ass brother...\\
22 - Sounds like you've got some anger towards him.\\
23 - Oh, you're good.\\
24 - This is nice...\\
25 - you and me spending time together.\\
26 - Why don't we do this more often?\\
27 - I don't have an answer.\\
28 - Me neither.\\
29 - So how long till the movie starts?\\
30 - About 20 minutes.\\
31 - Yeah, sure.\\
32 - 20 minutes, not counting previews and ads,\\
33 - the popcorn and the giant pretzel holding hands,\\
34 - the big soda drinking the little soda,\\
35 - which frankly is cannibalism,\\
36 - and the always welcome reminder\\
37 - to turn off your cell phones and shut up,\\
38 - but nobody ever does because, let's face it,\\
39 - good manners are just the latest casualty\\
40 - in the ongoing collapse of Western civilization.\\
41 - I now have an answer.\\
42 - I miss Jake.\\
43 - How can you miss him?\\
44 - We just dropped him off at his friend's house.\\
45 - By the way, if you ever get tired of those magazines\\
46 - under your bed, the kid's mom looked fairly do-able.\\
47 - Forget the mom. Did you see how happy Jake was\\
48 - to be spending the weekend away from me?\\
49 - Why would you think that?\\
50 - Just because he jumped out of the car\\
51 - while it was still moving?\\
52 - Come on, Alan, he was happy to see his friends.\\
53 - Being away from you is just gravy.\\
54 - I know. I know.\\
55 - It's natural for him to want to spend more time\\
56 - with his peers than his parents.\\
57 - But all the same, it's sad.\\
58 - Yeah.\\
59 - Sunrise, sunset.\\
60 - One day, you're holding a little baby in your arms,\\
61 - and the next day, he's off hocking loogies\\
62 - and lighting farts with a bunch of Ritalin-addled sixth graders.\\
63 - Why do I bother trying to share my feelings with you?\\
64 - I don't know.\\
65 - It's not like I encourage it.\\
66 - Oh, come on.\\
67 - So your kid doesn't need you like he used to.\\
68 - That's a good thing.\\
69 - You can spend your weekends enjoying yourself.\\
70 - That's true.\\
71 - And there's things I want to do that I haven't had time for.\\
72 - Like that kid's mom.\\
73 - No, no, I mean like reading--\\
74 - finally cracking open the classics.\\
75 - Alan, if you want to crack something open,\\
76 - I recommend that kid's mom.\\
77 - No, no, I'm serious.\\
78 - For years, I have been wishing that I had time\\
79 - to read all the great books.\\
80 - Dostoyevsky,\\
81 - and Hemingway, Faulkner, and Dickens, and Shakespeare\\
82 - and history!\\
83 - History: U.S. history, world history,\\
84 - the history of language.\\
85 - I mean, why doesn't anyone speak Sumerian anymore?\\
86 - I don't know because I haven't read the book!\\
87 - And, oh, oh...\\
88 - poetry, poetry!\\
89 - Byron, and Keats, and Shelley!\\
90 - And biographies! Oh!\\
91 - Julius Caesar, and Abraham Lincoln, and, oh, Groucho Marx!\\
92 - I mean, look at them all!\\
93 - Look at them! They're mocking me!\\
94 - I haven't read any of them!\\
95 - Okay, well, just pick one for now.\\
96 - Why bother?!\\
97 - There's not enough time!\\
98 - There's too many books and not enough time!\\
99 - Maybe you just need a system.\\
100 - You know, put a book next to the toilet,\\
101 - and every couple days, you knock out a couple chapters.\\
102 - No, no! It's too late for me!\\
103 - There's not enough bowel movements left!\\
104 - Maybe you need to change your diet.\\
105 - No, it's hopeless!\\
106 - Jake will be grown up soon and I'll be dead.\\
107 - And you know what I'll have left behind?\\
108 - A life of unfulfilled dreams, a shelf of unread books,\\
109 - and three unopened seasons of Six Feet Under on DVD.\\
110 - So what are you doing tonight?\\
111 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
112 - * Ah * Men *\\
113 - All right.\\
114 - So your brother had a panic attack\\
115 - in the middle of a bookstore.\\
116 - How'd that make you feel?\\
117 - What the hell do my feelings have to do with anything?\\
118 - Why don't you just humor me?\\
119 - Well, I felt a little ashamed.\\
120 - Because you felt that his behavior reflected on you?\\
121 - No, because I left him there.\\
122 - You left him?\\
123 - Not permanently.\\
124 - I came back and got him after he was all cried out\\
125 - and it was time for the movie.\\
126 - So you still went to the movie?\\
127 - Yeah, I bought the tickets online.\\
128 - They don't refund those.\\
129 - Red Vine?\\
130 - No, thank you.\\
131 - I am so sorry.\\
132 - I don't know what came over me.\\
133 - Nah.\\
134 - Who among us hasn't collapsed, weeping,\\
135 - in the middle of a bookstore for no apparent reason?\\
136 - You know, I think maybe I'd be better off at home.\\
137 - So I'm supposed to miss the movie\\
138 - just because you had a nervous breakdown?\\
139 - Well, kind of.\\
140 - Don't you think that's a little selfish, Alan?\\
141 - It's just, all of a sudden,\\
142 - I felt crushed by this unbelievable sense of grief,\\
143 - like my entire life has been an exercise in pathetic futility.\\
144 - Well, I wouldn't rule it out.\\
145 - Come on, bunky, cheer up.\\
146 - Have a Red Vine.\\
147 - I don't want a Red Vine.\\
148 - Sno-Cap?\\
149 - No.\\
150 - Raisinets?\\
151 - No.\\
152 - Goober? How much crap did you buy?!\\
153 - They couldn't change a hundred.\\
154 - All right, I'll have a Junior Mint.\\
155 - I didn't get Junior Mints.\\
156 - Of course not.\\
157 - Story of my life.\\
158 - No Junior Mints for Alan... just Goobers.\\
159 - Goobers, Goobers, Goobers.\\
160 - Alan, be quiet.\\
161 - Why? Why?\\
162 - The first amendment gives me the right\\
163 - to yell "Goobers" in a crowded theater.\\
164 - Goobers!\\
165 - Hey, look.\\
166 - Movie quiz. Let's play the movie quiz. I don't want\\
167 - to play the movie quiz.\\
168 - Come on, it'll be fun.\\
169 - I'll bet you're good at it.\\
170 - All right, all right.\\
171 - "Debra Winger and Richard Gere starred\\
172 - in An Officer and a blank."\\
173 - Oh, please!\\
174 - You need a hint?\\
175 - There's a hint upside down in the corner.\\
176 - No, I don't need a hint!\\
177 - I know the answer!\\
178 - Everybody here knows the answer!\\
179 - Everybody on the planet knows the answer!\\
180 - We're not stupid!\\
181 - Chill, chill.\\
182 - Oh, wait, here's another brain teaser.\\
183 - "Steven Spielberg directed this modern retelling\\
184 - of the H.G. Wells classic War of the blank."\\
185 - Uh, uh, couch!\\
186 - War of the Couch!\\
187 - Stop it.\\
188 - Oh, no, no, I got it!\\
189 - War of the blow it out your ...!\\
190 - You know, maybe you're right.\\
191 - Maybe we should go.\\
192 - Wait, no, I know this one.\\
193 - "Johnny Depp cruised to success in this comedy-action film\\
194 - inspired by a Disneyland attraction."\\
195 - Pirates of the blow it out your ...!\\
196 - He's behind on his reading.\\
197 - Oh, oh, and let's not forget Judy Garland\\
198 - in that immortal classic The Wizard of blow it out your ...!\\
199 - That sounds like quite an episode.\\
200 - Is your brother seeing a therapist?\\
201 - How would I know?\\
202 - He's your brother.\\
203 - He lives with you.\\
204 - So?\\
205 - All right, go ahead.\\
206 - Just because I took him in\\
207 - doesn't mean I have to listen to him.\\
208 - I understand.\\
209 - He just whines about the same crap over and over.\\
210 - Okay.\\
211 - It's not even interesting crap.\\
212 - It's the crap that bores the crap out of crap.\\
213 - I got it.\\
214 - It's crap. Go ahead.\\
215 - Thank you.\\
216 - So we're driving home and...\\
217 - This seat is very comfortable.\\
218 - Genuine leather, nine-way adjustable, lumbar support...\\
219 - I wish I'd spent a few extra bucks\\
220 - and gotten the ejection package.\\
221 - I said I was sorry.\\
222 - They don't refund those tickets, Alan.\\
223 - I want to go see Jake.\\
224 - Why? He's at a sleepover.\\
225 - I just got this feeling that he needs me.\\
226 - Really? Some sort of telepathic thing?\\
227 - Exactly.\\
228 - I see.\\
229 - Ow!\\
230 - Did you know I was gonna do that?\\
231 - No.\\
232 - Then I wouldn't trust your psychic powers.\\
233 - Come on.\\
234 - We can just stop by for a few minutes.\\
235 - We have time now since we decided to skip the movie.\\
236 - Oh, we decided that, did we?\\
237 - That's the way it went down for you, huh?\\
238 - That's how you interpret recent events?!\\
239 - Whoa, whoa, settle down.\\
240 - You're acting like a crazy person.\\
241 - Me?!\\
242 - I'm acting like a crazy person?!\\
243 - Are you freaking kidding me?!\\
244 - Listen to yourself.\\
245 - You're getting a little scary right now.\\
246 - Okay, fine, you want to see the kid, we'll go see the kid.\\
247 - Thank you.\\
248 - Is that so hard?\\
249 - Charlie... the road.\\
250 - Please.\\
251 - You know, when you have kids,\\
252 - you find that there's a deep spiritual connection.\\
253 - You feel an actual tug when your child needs you.\\
254 - ( doorbell rings )\\
255 - Interesting.\\
256 - What do you feel when your brother hates you?\\
257 - ( kids yelling )\\
258 - Alan. Is everything okay?\\
259 - Oh, yeah, fine.\\
260 - I just need to see Jake for a minute.\\
261 - He's feeling a tug.\\
262 - Tug?\\
263 - Or it could be gas.\\
264 - We're not sure.\\
265 - Could you just call Jake?\\
266 - Jake! Your father's here!\\
267 - Put that down, Timmy!\\
268 - What?\\
269 - I just wanted to see if you were okay.\\
270 - Oh, great.\\
271 - Now I'm dead! Thanks a lot!\\
272 - Doesn't count! I was talking to my stupid dad!\\
273 - Well, it seems like you've got everything under control.\\
274 - Actually, I ran out of ice cream.\\
275 - Do you think you could\\
276 - keep an eye on the kids for a few minutes?\\
277 - Uh... Thanks a million.\\
278 - I'll be right back.\\
279 - ( car door slams )\\
280 - ( engine starts )\\
281 - ( tires screech )\\
282 - She ain't coming back.\\
283 - CHARLIE: Three hours\\
284 - she was gone.\\
285 - And when she finally came back,\\
286 - she was reeking of Old Spice and pot.\\
287 - I see.\\
288 - And she didn't even have any ice cream!\\
289 - All right, let's stop here for a minute and talk in general\\
290 - about your feelings towards women.\\
291 - No, thanks.\\
292 - Rather discuss your childhood?\\
293 - Nope.\\
294 - Father?\\
295 - Dead.\\
296 - Mother?\\
297 - Killed him.\\
298 - Would you like to discuss that?\\
299 - We just did.\\
300 - Charlie, I'm not sure we're on the same page here.\\
301 - Have you ever been in therapy before?\\
302 - Does massage therapy count?\\
303 - No.\\
304 - It's almost the same thing.\\
305 - One on one with a strange woman who charges you for an hour\\
306 - then only gives you 50 minutes.\\
307 - Why don't we just go back to your story?\\
308 - Touch a nerve there, did I?\\
309 - Okay, okay.\\
310 - Well, Jake ignored his father the entire time we were there,\\
311 - so Alan was a little upset when we got back in the car.\\
312 - He hates me!\\
313 - My only son hates me!\\
314 - He doesn't hate you.\\
315 - He just didn't appreciate you telling his friends\\
316 - that laser tag can induce epileptic fits.\\
317 - Well, it can.\\
318 - Be that as it may,\\
319 - you probably could've gotten your point across\\
320 - without flopping around on the floor,\\
321 - rolling your eyes up\\
322 - and pretending to swallow your tongue.\\
323 - Hey, hey, a-a picture is worth a thousand...\\
324 - Charlie, stop the car.\\
325 - Why?\\
326 - I have to get out. I... I'm feeling claustrophobic.\\
327 - There's no place to stop. We have to stop!\\
328 - Where?\\
329 - I-I can't breathe!\\
330 - I can't breathe. I-I have to get out.\\
331 - Okay... I have to get out now, now, now, now!\\
332 - Okay, hold on, hold on.\\
333 - ( groans )\\
334 - Oh!\\
335 - The seat belt won't come off.\\
336 - Just push the button.\\
337 - I can't, I can't. It won't come off. Help me!\\
338 - Okay, okay, move your hands.\\
339 - ( loud panting )\\
340 - Okay.\\
341 - It's passing.\\
342 - Yes, it's... Yes, I-I'm okay.\\
343 - No, you're not.\\
344 - What?\\
345 - Get out.\\
346 - What?\\
347 - Get out now!\\
348 - Now, now, now, now, now!\\
349 - ( sighs )\\
350 - That's better.\\
351 - * Men.\\
352 - He couldn't believe it, either.\\
353 - ( chuckles )\\
354 - You should have seen his face in the rearview mirror.\\
355 - All right, Charlie, we've been talking\\
356 - for quite a while, and I got to tell you,\\
357 - I still don't understand why you came to see me.\\
358 - You in a hurry?\\
359 - Doesn't that undermine your whole\\
360 - pay by the hour business model?\\
361 - Go ahead.\\
362 - Thank you.\\
363 - So, as I was driving away,\\
364 - I decided I needed a little quiet time\\
365 - for, you know, reflection and meditation.\\
366 - Hey.\\
367 - Hey. What took you so long?\\
368 - I was sure you'd come back.\\
369 - Huh. I guess that's case closed on the telepathy stuff.\\
370 - What are you drinking?\\
371 - I don't know. Something soothing.\\
372 - Uh, uh, Kahlua and cream?\\
373 - He's kidding. Give him a beer.\\
374 - Must you always embarrass me?\\
375 - I've had a traumatic night.\\
376 - Yeah, Yeah, okay, shut up, shut up, shut up.\\
377 - Hi.\\
378 - Hi.\\
379 - Yeah, hi.\\
380 - Can we buy you ladies a drink?\\
381 - No, thanks. We're already pretty blitzed.\\
382 - Boy, are we blitzed.\\
383 - Perfect.\\
384 - I'm Charlie. This is Alan.\\
385 - Amy. Beth.\\
386 - Nice to meet you.\\
387 - How's it going tonight?\\
388 - Pretty good.\\
389 - We're blitzed.\\
390 - How about you?\\
391 - Yeah, how you doin'?\\
392 - Oh, boy. Where to start?\\
393 - No one's talking to you.\\
394 - What's the matter, Alan?\\
395 - Yeah, what's the matter?\\
396 - Well, you-you really want to know?\\
397 - They don't. Trust me, you really don't.\\
398 - Well, maybe it's a-a late reaction\\
399 - to the divorce, uh, maybe it's my son not needing me\\
400 - so much now that he's growing up, but...\\
401 - But I think... I think it's more than that.\\
402 - I-I...I think it's just life grinding me down, and I just...\\
403 - ( teary ): I don't think I can take it anymore.\\
404 - Oh, you poor baby.\\
405 - Poor, poor baby.\\
406 - Tell us all about it.\\
407 - Well, I was never a happy child.\\
408 - I was a miserable kid.\\
409 - And-And-And the only thing\\
410 - that gave my life meaning was my son.\\
411 - At least you've got a son.\\
412 - I've got nothing except...\\
413 - epilepsy.\\
414 - Oh, no. Really? Oh, no.\\
415 - CHARLIE: So anyway, there I was on the wedding day\\
416 - in front of the priest and all our friends,\\
417 - flopping around on the altar like an epileptic trout,\\
418 - when I heard her father say,\\
419 - "You can't marry this man.\\
420 - He's damaged goods."\\
421 - Oh, gee. Yeah.\\
422 - Oh, gee.\\
423 - That's when I realized that all the money in the world--\\
424 - and I do have a lot--\\
425 - can't replace that special tug you feel...\\
426 - when someone loves you unconditionally.\\
427 - Oh!\\
428 - Oh!\\
429 - Look, that's the ocean.\\
430 - Ooh, the ocean.\\
431 - Let's go skinny dipping. Yeah, skinny dipping.\\
432 - You want to come? Yeah, come with us.\\
433 - I'd love to, but I'm too sad,\\
434 - and I might swallow my tongue.\\
435 - You two go.\\
436 - Swim, splash, frolic,\\
437 - enjoy the healthy bodies.\\
438 - Okay. Bye.\\
439 - ( giggling )\\
440 - Have you no shame?\\
441 - Let me think.\\
442 - Nope. Just a tug.\\
443 - Now that's another thing.\\
444 - My angst is real.\\
445 - I-I do not appreciate you taking my tug\\
446 - and using it to get in someone's pants.\\
447 - News flash, Alan-- they're already out of their pants.\\
448 - And they're gonna come back cold, wet,\\
449 - and in desperate need of body beat.\\
450 - Which means for those of us with normal skin temperature,\\
451 - it'll be a seller's market.\\
452 - You're unbelievable.\\
453 - No, I just think ahead.\\
454 - They're only gonna last\\
455 - about two seconds in that water, so we have to hurry.\\
456 - I'll get the wine, you light some candles,\\
457 - get a little ambiance going. I'm sorry, I'm really not in the mood.\\
458 - Are you saying that I have to get you liquored up\\
459 - so I can get laid?\\
460 - All right, I'll go along, but only as a favor to you.\\
461 - Thank you.\\
462 - I'm probably gonna have to apply the condom\\
463 - and get a rope and pulley\\
464 - to lower one of those broads onto him.\\
465 - Since you're making me do this, I get Amy.\\
466 - The hell you do!\\
467 - Which one's Amy?\\
468 - Amy's the one who overcame the eating disorder.\\
469 - Starving herself or throwing up?\\
470 - Does it make a difference?\\
471 - It does if you're paying for dinner.\\
472 - Amy is the brunette.\\
473 - Got it. So I have Jennifer.\\
474 - You mean Beth.\\
475 - Right, right, "B" for blonde.\\
476 - "B" can also be for brunette.\\
477 - But Amy's the brunette.\\
478 - So you could do "A" for anorexic.\\
479 - Unless it's "B" for bulimic.\\
480 - Good point.\\
481 - We're gonna need a new system.\\
482 - Do you smell something?\\
483 - ( sniffs ): Yeah, what is that?\\
484 - I think you do these things just to piss me off.\\
485 - Oh my God, what happened?\\
486 - Well, while I was trying to put it out,\\
487 - my brother stupidly called the fire department.\\
488 - Why was that stupid?\\
489 - Have you seen a Malibu fireman recently?\\
490 - They're all young, buff surfer dudes\\
491 - whippin' their big hoses around.\\
492 - Amy and Beth jumped on their hook and ladder\\
493 - like a couple of Dalmatians.\\
494 - I never saw 'em again.\\
495 - Ah yes, the Malibu fire department.\\
496 - I have several patients\\
497 - who compulsively masturbate to their calendar.\\
498 - No kidding.\\
499 - Both sexes.\\
500 - So anyway, Charlie, I'm still not clear\\
501 - on what it is you would like me to help you with.\\
502 - Uh, your anger issues, your sexual issues,\\
503 - your drinking.\\
504 - No, no, no, no, that's all cool.\\
505 - Then tell me, why are you here?\\
506 - Okay. Well, I'm here to lay some groundwork for the future.\\
507 - Some groundwork?\\
508 - Yeah. I've come to realize that there's a very good chance\\
509 - that I might some day snap and kill my brother.\\
510 - And I figure, if I'm already under a psychiatrist's care,\\
511 - then I can always cop an insanity plea.\\
512 - You're thinking of killing your brother?\\
513 - Shh!\\
514 - Doctor-patient confidentiality.\\
515 - * Men.\\
516 - Check in the drawer by the coffee machine.\\
517 - Hey, what do you think of this for the new drapes?\\
518 - Too small.\\
519 - I don't know. I think it's kind of cheerful.\\
520 - I'll put it in the maybe pile.\\
521 - You do that.\\
522 - You know, we're also gonna have\\
523 - to reupholster the couch.\\
524 - You think?\\
525 - Well, there was a lot of water damage,\\
526 - which, quite frankly, I think was the result\\
527 - of the firemen showing off for the girls.\\
528 - You could be right.\\
529 - You know,\\
530 - I-I just want to tell you, I-I really appreciate\\
531 - you stickin' by me in the past couple of days,\\
532 - you know, pulling me out of my funk.\\
533 - You really are a great brother.\\
534 - I don't know what I'd do without you.\\
535 - I don't know what I'd do without you, either.\\
536 - But, golly, it's sure fun to think about.
\subsection {Episode 13: Humiliation Is a Visual Medium}
1 - Charlie?\\
2 - Yeah?\\
3 - I thought we said we were gonna take things slow.\\
4 - We did say that.\\
5 - I guess we can't be trusted.\\
6 - Charlie, talk to me.\\
7 - All right.\\
8 - You know what I'm gonna do to you, you dirty, filthy girl?\\
9 - No, not like that.\\
10 - Wrong way?\\
11 - Am I a dirty, filthy boy?\\
12 - No, I want to talk about us.\\
13 - We're a dirty, filthy couple.\\
14 - No, I want to talk about our relationship.\\
15 - Well, that redirects the old blood flow.\\
16 - Okay.\\
17 - So what about it?\\
18 - Well, you know that I really care about you?\\
19 - I care about you, too.\\
20 - All right, good talk.\\
21 - I just want to make sure that if we do this,\\
22 - we're doing it for the right reasons.\\
23 - Well, not to be contrary,\\
24 - but sometimes the wrong reasons\\
25 - kick everything up a notch.\\
26 - I just want to make sure\\
27 - we give our relationship a chance to grow.\\
28 - So you want to stop?\\
29 - No, I really want you.\\
30 - Mia, all this starting and stopping\\
31 - is really not good for my transmission.\\
32 - I'm sorry.\\
33 - I'm just so confused.\\
34 - That's why you're gonna have to make this decision\\
35 - for the both of us.\\
36 - Me?\\
37 - I have to make this decision?\\
38 - That's like asking the fat kid to guard the pie.\\
39 - I trust you, Charlie.\\
40 - Well, that is really low.\\
41 - Okay, we'll wait.\\
42 - Thank you.\\
43 - So what do we do now?\\
44 - We could take a walk on the beach.\\
45 - No, seriously.\\
46 - Oh, yeah. Walk on the beach.\\
47 - Great.\\
48 - I've always been meaning to do that.\\
49 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
50 - * Ooh... * Men.\\
51 - Good morning. Good morning.\\
52 - Looks to be a beautiful day.\\
53 - Slightly overcast,\\
54 - but that should burn off in a few hours,\\
55 - leaving us with another sun- dappled afternoon in paradise.\\
56 - You still drunk from last night\\
57 - or did you get a fresh buzz this morning?\\
58 - No, ma'am. I am quite simply high on life.\\
59 - Blotto.\\
60 - I'm not drunk.\\
61 - Alan, guess what I did last night.\\
62 - Jake.\\
63 - I'm leaving.\\
64 - No, Jake can hear this.\\
65 - Last night... Wait, wait, wait. Hang on, Charlie.\\
66 - You're about to tell us something\\
67 - that happened last night that made you happy?\\
68 - Yes. Jake.\\
69 - I'm leaving.\\
70 - Jake, stay.\\
71 - I want to share this with my entire family.\\
72 - Okay, I'm leaving.\\
73 - Berta, I consider you part of my family.\\
74 - Am I in your will?\\
75 - No, but neither are the rest of them.\\
76 - Now, listen.\\
77 - Last night, I, Charlie Harper, delayed gratification.\\
78 - What'd you do, wait till she fell asleep.\\
79 - Wait for what?\\
80 - Jake.\\
81 - I'm leaving. Sit down.\\
82 - What happened last night\\
83 - is I may have actually started a meaningful relationship.\\
84 - Charlie, seriously, go sleep it off.\\
85 - You're embarrassing yourself.\\
86 - Come on, listen to me.\\
87 - I think I might be in love with Mia.\\
88 - Big deal.\\
89 - You've always been in love with you-a.\\
90 - Very funny.\\
91 - I thought so. Did you think so?\\
92 - That was pretty good.\\
93 - He's eleven.\\
94 - He still thinks "milk, milk, lemonade" is funny.\\
95 - Oh, yeah.\\
96 - Hello! Grandmommy's here.\\
97 - Oh, great, tell Mom what you told us, Charlie.\\
98 - No.\\
99 - Tell me what.\\
100 - Nothing.\\
101 - Do you need a good lawyer? No.\\
102 - Discreet doctor? No.\\
103 - Knock-off Gucci handbag? What?\\
104 - There's only so many ways I can help you dear.\\
105 - It's no big deal.\\
106 - I've just been seeing this ballet dancer\\
107 - and I think she might be the one.\\
108 - Drunk?\\
109 - He says no.\\
110 - I think it might be one of those designer drugs.\\
111 - Charlie, what did you take?\\
112 - I'm serious.\\
113 - We've been seeing each other for over a month\\
114 - and we're waiting to sleep together\\
115 - until our relationship has a solid foundation.\\
116 - Well, we can rule out ecstasy.\\
117 - I mean, that's a powerful aphrodisiac.\\
118 - I've heard.\\
119 - Nowadays you're supposed to say African American-disiac.\\
120 - Jake.\\
121 - You sure this time?\\
122 - Yeah.\\
123 - I'm leaving.\\
124 - Has it occurred to any of you that maybe I've finally matured?\\
125 - Maybe I'm finally ready to build something with a woman\\
126 - that isn't solely based on sex.\\
127 - Has that occurred to you, Alan? Nope.\\
128 - Berta? Uh-uh.\\
129 - So it's not just me.\\
130 - You know, I can understand your skepticism.\\
131 - I've earned it.\\
132 - But this girl is different.\\
133 - And I'm gonna make it work.\\
134 - I give him another week\\
135 - before he's out on the beach humping wet sand.\\
136 - * Getting to know you\\
137 - * Getting to know all about you *\\
138 - * Getting to like you\\
139 - * Getting to hope you like me *\\
140 - * Getting to know you\\
141 - * Putting it my way, but nicely *\\
142 - * You are precisely my cup of tea... *\\
143 - *\\
144 - *\\
145 - Hey.\\
146 - Hey.\\
147 - How was your date?\\
148 - Fun.\\
149 - We went bowling.\\
150 - Still playing it slow?\\
151 - Ketchup slow.\\
152 - Glacier slow.\\
153 - Continental drift slow.\\
154 - So, slow.\\
155 - I'm saying.\\
156 - Hey, listen, about this living without sex thing,\\
157 - I was hoping you can give me a little advice.\\
158 - Me? What would make you think of me?\\
159 - Well, I figured you get laid less often\\
160 - than a boil-covered dwarf, am I right?\\
161 - I don't have the actual statistics, but go on.\\
162 - Well, you must get really frustrated.\\
163 - I mean, how do you stop yourself from, you know,\\
164 - running a red light and then taunting the cop\\
165 - till he shoots you?\\
166 - Ah, good question.\\
167 - I found that the best thing to do is to focus on your career,\\
168 - uh, get a hobby, become involved in community activities\\
169 - and, at the end of the day, if you have any energy left,\\
170 - find a quiet space and yank it like a monkey in a mango tree.\\
171 - Interesting.\\
172 - Mm.\\
173 - What kind of hobbies are we talking about?\\
174 - Uh, well I tried collecting stamps,\\
175 - uh, building model trains,\\
176 - but, in the end, all roads led back up the mango tree.\\
177 - That's what I was afraid of.\\
178 - Hey, where're you going?\\
179 - I'm gonna go get in my car,\\
180 - run a red light and hope for a clean head shot.\\
181 - * Men...\\
182 - The great thing about this piece\\
183 - is that it fuses a classical score with jazz choreography.\\
184 - Wow.\\
185 - You know, on a counter programming note,\\
186 - the Lakers are playing Miami tonight.\\
187 - Would you rather watch that?\\
188 - No, no, this is fine.\\
189 - Of course, I don't have a $500 bet down on the ballet.\\
190 - What channel?\\
191 - No, seriously, this is... Channel 2.\\
192 - You know Charlie, you don't have to give up\\
193 - things that you like just because of me.\\
194 - Okay, great.\\
195 - Good to know.\\
196 - Hey, as long as we're on that subject...\\
197 - ...there's something I want to run past you.\\
198 - Go ahead.\\
199 - Well, let me just preface it\\
200 - by saying that I am all for holding off on the sex\\
201 - so our relationship can develop more, you know... deepness.\\
202 - I'm glad. I think it's working, too.\\
203 - We're getting so much closer than we would have\\
204 - had we just jumped into bed together.\\
205 - Good. Sounds like we're on the same page.\\
206 - And just to make sure we don't jump the gun,\\
207 - I was thinking maybe it'd be a good idea if I had an outlet\\
208 - that, you know, took the pressure off.\\
209 - An outlet?\\
210 - Yeah, an outlet.\\
211 - Something casual, meaningless.\\
212 - If I work it right, it could even be anonymous.\\
213 - You mean another woman?\\
214 - Well, that would be my first choice.\\
215 - But for the purposes of this discussion,\\
216 - let's stay with the more neutral term "outlet."\\
217 - I don't care what you call it.\\
218 - You're asking for permission to have sex with another woman.\\
219 - Only because I care about you too much\\
220 - to whore around without permission.\\
221 - Are you crazy?\\
222 - I can't go back to the mango tree, Mia.\\
223 - What?\\
224 - Look, I think this is a mature, thoughtful suggestion.\\
225 - In fact, there are many cultures\\
226 - that embrace the whole outlet concept\\
227 - as a way of strengthening and nurturing\\
228 - the primary love relationship.\\
229 - Oh... ( blows raspberry )\\
230 - You can't dismiss entire cultures with...\\
231 - ( blows raspberry )\\
232 - I'm going home.\\
233 - Oh, come on, we're just talking here.\\
234 - I propose an idea, we bat it around a little bit\\
235 - and then we compromise.\\
236 - That's the cornerstone of a healthy relationship.\\
237 - How are we gonna compromise, Charlie?\\
238 - Are you gonna have sex with half a woman?\\
239 - Is that an option?\\
240 - What's going on?\\
241 - We had our first fight.\\
242 - Oh. What about?\\
243 - I simply suggested that as long as we weren't having sex,\\
244 - it would be good for our relationship\\
245 - if I had sex with somebody else.\\
246 - And she didn't buy that?\\
247 - Wouldn't even discuss it.\\
248 - Women, huh?\\
249 - They say they want to talk,\\
250 - but they don't want to talk.\\
251 - What's the matter with Uncle Charlie?\\
252 - Oh, he's just a little down 'cause he\\
253 - had a fight with his girlfriend.\\
254 - That's too bad.\\
255 - Why don't you go out and talk to him?\\
256 - Maybe you can cheer him up a little.\\
257 - How? I don't know.\\
258 - Tell him a joke or something. Okay.\\
259 - Might as well just give him a bowl of Milky Ways.\\
260 - Hey, Uncle Charlie, what's green, has four legs\\
261 - and would kill you if it fell out of a tree and landed on you?\\
262 - What?\\
263 - A pool table.\\
264 - That's funny 'cause you wouldn't\\
265 - expect it to be in a tree.\\
266 - Nothin'.\\
267 - Okay, I'll talk to him.\\
268 - Hey, if you can work up a fart, ask him to pull your finger.\\
269 - Hey. Hey.\\
270 - Still haven't heard from Mia?\\
271 - She won't return my calls.\\
272 - You do realize that suggesting it would be good\\
273 - for you to have sex with other women\\
274 - was a monumentally stupid thing to do.\\
275 - Yes, Alan, I realize it.\\
276 - The question now is how do I apologize?\\
277 - You mean grovel.\\
278 - No, I mean apologize with my dignity and pride intact.\\
279 - Oh, you sad, naive fool.\\
280 - If 12 years of marriage taught me anything,\\
281 - it's that there is no apologizing without groveling.\\
282 - Mia and I aren't married.\\
283 - Are you having sex?\\
284 - Continue.\\
285 - First of all, the phone's no good.\\
286 - You must grovel in person.\\
287 - Humiliation is a visual medium.\\
288 - Okay.\\
289 - Next, uh, don't go empty-handed.\\
290 - But, uh, keep in mind that any gifts you do offer\\
291 - may well end up being thrown at your head.\\
292 - Uh, flowers, lingerie, jewelry-- all good.\\
293 - Picture frames, waffle irons, steak knives-- not so much.\\
294 - You actually bought your wife a waffle iron?\\
295 - I was young. She liked waffles.\\
296 - Anyway, the most important thing is sincerity.\\
297 - Sincerity?\\
298 - Yes, you absolutely must be able to fake sincerity.\\
299 - You know what? I've underestimated you.\\
300 - You are far more deceitful and manipulative\\
301 - than I've given you credit for.\\
302 - Thank you.\\
303 - No, I was faking sincerity.\\
304 - Oh, that's very good.\\
305 - But all kidding aside, I really appreciate your help.\\
306 - You're welcome.\\
307 - Ah! Got ya again.\\
308 - That's... that was good.\\
309 - Oh, hey, can you do me a favor?\\
310 - What's that?\\
311 - Uh, pull my finger.\\
312 - You're bluffing.\\
313 - Try me.\\
314 - Give me another chance.\\
315 - I thought I had one.\\
316 - * Men... *\\
317 - Hi.\\
318 - Hi.\\
319 - These are for you.\\
320 - Aw, you didn't have to do that.\\
321 - Really? My brother said I did.\\
322 - Well, thank him for me.\\
323 - Come on in.\\
324 - I just want you to know how sorry I am.\\
325 - Actually, I think I owe you an apology.\\
326 - You do?!\\
327 - Yeah, these are for you.\\
328 - Aw, you didn't have to do that.\\
329 - I shouldn't have gotten so angry with you.\\
330 - Not to say that your "outlet" idea wasn't incredibly\\
331 - juvenile, selfish, moronic--\\
332 - Whoa, whoa, whoa. I accept your apology.\\
333 - The point is, is that I really don't have any right\\
334 - to object to you sleeping with other women.\\
335 - We don't have a commitment.\\
336 - You're free to do whatever you want.\\
337 - Well, thanks.\\
338 - That's great. Very mature.\\
339 - So everything's okay now?\\
340 - No, you ass!\\
341 - If we're gonna keep seeing each other, I want a commitment.\\
342 - A commitment? Yes, a commitment.\\
343 - Does that mean we can start having sex?\\
344 - Is that the only reason you'd be willing to make a commitment?\\
345 - It's in the top two.\\
346 - Well, I think sex should wait until\\
347 - we get our relationship on track.\\
348 - Okay, okay, let me make sure I understand this.\\
349 - You want me to make a commitment\\
350 - that I will not have sex with anyone else while,\\
351 - at the same time, I'm not having sex with you?\\
352 - Yes.\\
353 - All right, let's come at this from another angle.\\
354 - We're gonna be sexually exclusive, but without the sex?\\
355 - Well, I suppose you could look at it that way.\\
356 - ( sighs )\\
357 - So bottom line...\\
358 - No sex for Charlie...\\
359 - ...with you or anyone else, for the foreseeable future.\\
360 - Correct.\\
361 - Are you insane?!\\
362 - Charlie, if you care about us,\\
363 - it should be something that you want to do.\\
364 - What about you? What are you giving up?\\
365 - I'm giving up the same thing you are.\\
366 - Do you want to sleep with other guys? Of course not.\\
367 - Then you're giving up nothing!\\
368 - Tell you what, I'll give up sex, you give up--\\
369 - I don't know-- a kidney.\\
370 - Oh, don't be stupid.\\
371 - Okay, okay-- dancing.\\
372 - Dancing's my life, Charlie.\\
373 - Aha! Now we have a level playing field.\\
374 - You know what, maybe you should just go.\\
375 - You're right-- why stay here,\\
376 - when I can just as easily not have sex with you\\
377 - in the comfort of my own home.\\
378 - Oh, go to hell!\\
379 - See?\\
380 - That's why you didn't get a waffle iron.\\
381 - * Men... *\\
382 - ( whirring stops )\\
383 - Hey, how'd it go with Mia?\\
384 - Great. We broke up.\\
385 - How's that great?\\
386 - Because now I can go back to being who I really am.\\
387 - And who's that?\\
388 - Someone who doesn't care who he really is.\\
389 - Somebody who just has fun.\\
390 - Oh, I see.\\
391 - Someone who spends his life in a drunken haze\\
392 - having meaningless sex with strangers.\\
393 - If you knew who I am, why'd you ask?\\
394 - Hurry, Charlie.\\
395 - I'm starting to sober up.\\
396 - Well, we can't have that.\\
397 - No, you might find out who she is.\\
398 - Here you go. Good.\\
399 - Boy, I haven't been this drunk since I took my S.A.T.'s.\\
400 - Doesn't seem to have held you back much.\\
401 - No, just one year.\\
402 - Sixth grade.\\
403 - Charlie, you okay?\\
404 - Yeah, I just got a lot on my mind.\\
405 - ( sympathetically ): Aw....\\
406 - Do you wanna look at my boobs?\\
407 - No, thanks.\\
408 - You sure? It always cheers me up.\\
409 - ( knocking )\\
410 - Oh, Mia. Hi.\\
411 - Is Charlie here?\\
412 - Uh...\\
413 - WOMAN: Tickle, tickle.\\
414 - CHARLIE ( laughing ): Cut it out!\\
415 - That was great. Do it again.\\
416 - Alan, don't you think it's time you went out\\
417 - and kept your girlfriend company?\\
418 - My what?!\\
419 - Thanks for playing along.\\
420 - Oh, yes, uh, uh, uh... my girlfriend.\\
421 - Yes, uh, excuse me.\\
422 - Coming... Pookie.\\
423 - Well, this is an awkward moment.\\
424 - You are such a schmuck.\\
425 - Okay, the ice is broken. Good-bye, Charlie.\\
426 - Oh, come on, you said yourself we don't have a commitment.\\
427 - We don't even have a relationship anymore.\\
428 - You know what? You're right, Charlie. Go back to your bimbo.\\
429 - Hey, hey, hey, she's not a bimbo.\\
430 - WOMAN: Yay.\\
431 - I'm not saying she's a brain surgeon.\\
432 - No, wait. Mia.\\
433 - At least tell me why you came.\\
434 - You wanna know why I came?\\
435 - I came because, after I cooled down,\\
436 - I started to miss you.\\
437 - And I wanted to make love to you.\\
438 - That's great, it's wonderful.\\
439 - And it's not gonna happen.\\
440 - Why, 'cause of that bimbo?\\
441 - Let me tell you something.\\
442 - The entire time I was out there drinking\\
443 - and fooling around with her, I was thinking of you.\\
444 - Oh, swell.\\
445 - You know what I mean.\\
446 - I would trade a hundred of her for one of you.\\
447 - Are you saying you're ready to make a commitment?\\
448 - Yes.\\
449 - Maybe you want some time to think about it.\\
450 - How could that help?\\
451 - Look, I don't want to be with anybody but you, so...\\
452 - I might as well be committed.\\
453 - You're so funny.\\
454 - You wanna go upstairs?\\
455 - Not right now.\\
456 - Oh, please don't tell me you've got somebody in your room.\\
457 - No, no, no.\\
458 - No.\\
459 - I just think if we're gonna do this commitment thing,\\
460 - that the first time should be really special.\\
461 - What have you got in mind?\\
462 - Well, you know, candles, music and...\\
463 - maybe not having the girl I was trying to rebound with\\
464 - dancing half-naked on the deck with my idiot brother.\\
465 - Are you sure?\\
466 - Oh, yeah, he's an idiot.\\
467 - Call me later.\\
468 - Well, back to the mango tree.\\
469 - * Men... *\\
470 - Ugh, what is this?\\
471 - It's a healthy cereal that won't rot your teeth.\\
472 - You got that right, 'cause I'm not eating it.\\
473 - Well, that's all you're getting.\\
474 - Morning.\\
475 - Morning. Morning.\\
476 - Is he in a better mood today? Yeah.\\
477 - Uncle Charlie, I got another joke for you.\\
478 - Okay.\\
479 - There's two muffins\\
480 - sitting side by side in a muffin tin in the oven.\\
481 - One muffin says to the other, "Boy, it's hot in here."\\
482 - And the other one says, "Holy crap, a talking muffin!"\\
483 - I just don't think he knows what's funny.

1 - ( sighs )\\
2 - This is such a beautiful sunset.\\
3 - Thanks.\\
4 - "Thanks"?\\
5 - You're taking credit for the sunset?\\
6 - Well, no, not-not-not the sunset, per se,\\
7 - but I did buy a very expensive house on the beach\\
8 - so we can stand here and watch the sunset,\\
9 - so... thanks.\\
10 - The fancy beach house works\\
11 - with a lot of women, doesn't it?\\
12 - Honestly?\\
13 - It's like a G-spot with two mortgages.\\
14 - ( laughs ): Well, just so you know,\\
15 - I'm not with you for your house or your money.\\
16 - So it's the car.\\
17 - Why would I care about your car?\\
18 - It's an $80,000 Mercedes.\\
19 - Yeah, so?\\
20 - What does it do that other cars don't do?\\
21 - It costs $80,000.\\
22 - ( laughing )\\
23 - Hey, I almost forgot.\\
24 - I have something for you.\\
25 - Oh, Charlie, you don't have to buy me expensive jewelry.\\
26 - Okay, nothing but cheap crap from now on.\\
27 - ( gasps ): It's beautiful.\\
28 - Read the inscription.\\
29 - "One month, two weeks, four days."\\
30 - What-what does it mean?\\
31 - Well, since we've decided to go ahead\\
32 - and consummate our relationship, finally,\\
33 - I thought I should honor the time\\
34 - we've already spent together... exclusively...\\
35 - in a committed relationship...\\
36 - without any sex...\\
37 - what-so-ever.\\
38 - So unless we have sex before midnight tonight,\\
39 - you're going to need to buy a new bracelet?\\
40 - Uh-huh. You're pretty sure of yourself, aren't you?\\
41 - Uh-huh.\\
42 - Well, since you went to all the trouble\\
43 - to engrave it...\\
44 - Don't even ask what I used as a chisel.\\
45 - ( doorbell rings )\\
46 - Kandi.\\
47 - Hello, Alan. Is Charlie available?\\
48 - Because I wish to speak with him.\\
49 - Oh, oh, uh... uh, okay.\\
50 - Um, why don't you wait here, and I'll, uh, let him know.\\
51 - I would be immensely appreciative if you would.\\
52 - All righty.\\
53 - What the hell does... this mean?\\
54 - I was sending you a message.\\
55 - What, that you're a woman trapped in a man's body?\\
56 - Kandi's here.\\
57 - And you want me to call you Kandi?\\
58 - No, Kandi, the girl you were seeing before Mia.\\
59 - Oh...\\
60 - Charlie, she's been calling here for days.\\
61 - Don't you think it's time you let her know\\
62 - you're in an exclusive relationship with another woman?\\
63 - Yeah, Charlie.\\
64 - After all, it's been\\
65 - "one month, two weeks, four days."\\
66 - Did you know that Alan's a woman\\
67 - trapped in a man's body?\\
68 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
69 - * Ooh * Men.\\
70 - So...\\
71 - are you going to go talk to your ex-girlfriend?\\
72 - Okay, first of all, sweetheart,\\
73 - she's not really an ex-girlfriend.\\
74 - Her name's Kandi.\\
75 - Thanks, Alan.\\
76 - With a "K."\\
77 - Alan...\\
78 - And an "I."\\
79 - Okay, so if Kandi with a "K" and and "I"\\
80 - isn't your ex-girlfriend, then what is she?\\
81 - Well, I-I-I'd-I would say she's more of a, uh, person\\
82 - who would drop by from time to time and, uh...\\
83 - yeah, that.\\
84 - And why haven't you told this person\\
85 - that you're in a committed relationship?\\
86 - Her name's Kandi.\\
87 - Boy, you're on thin ice.\\
88 - I think we both know why you didn't tell her.\\
89 - Well, if that's the case, then this discussion is moot...\\
90 - ...and we should go upstairs\\
91 - while Alan goes back out there\\
92 - and delivers a very credible lie as to my whereabouts. Alan?\\
93 - Well, I'm not half the liar you are,\\
94 - but I'll give it a shot.\\
95 - Shall we go upstairs and continue this conversation?\\
96 - Are you out of your freakin' mind?\\
97 - Okay. You're mad. I get that.\\
98 - So?\\
99 - Uh, well, Kandi,\\
100 - it's like this.\\
101 - Charlie's with another woman.\\
102 - Don't lie to me, Alan.\\
103 - Okay, uh, he's in Africa\\
104 - working as a scrub nurse for Doctors without Borders.\\
105 - Story of my life!\\
106 - That's the story of your life?\\
107 - It's not always a scrub nurse, but it's always Africa.\\
108 - Before you say anything else, I want you to know\\
109 - I've anticipated problems like this.\\
110 - Look on the other side of the bracelet.\\
111 - "I'm very, very sorry."\\
112 - Huh? Huh?\\
113 - You know what your problem is, Charlie?\\
114 - It's that you don't really believe in this relationship.\\
115 - Not believe in it?\\
116 - It's kept me from having sex for over six weeks.\\
117 - That'd be like not believing in a serious groin pull.\\
118 - You know what Kandi is?\\
119 - I try not to judge.\\
120 - She's a lifeboat.\\
121 - You're keeping a lifeboat for when this ship sinks.\\
122 - Hey, hey, hey, lifeboats don't mean\\
123 - you expect the ship to sink--\\
124 - the relation-ship, if I may.\\
125 - What they mean is that you have\\
126 - a-a-a healthy respect for the... power of the sea.\\
127 - Are you listening to yourself?\\
128 - Yeah, I just caught the last part.\\
129 - Not well thought out. No.\\
130 - All my life, guys have looked at me\\
131 - like I'm just some kind of sex toy.\\
132 - Well, they're wrong.\\
133 - Yeah. Just because you're good at something\\
134 - doesn't mean you should be pigeonholed.\\
135 - Uh-huh.\\
136 - And the only reason I'm so good at it\\
137 - is 'cause I practice.\\
138 - A-ha.\\
139 - Of course, all the practice in the world\\
140 - isn't going to help if you don't love\\
141 - what you're doing.\\
142 - A-ha.\\
143 - What do you want me to do, Mia,\\
144 - call every woman I've ever known just to announce\\
145 - that I'm now in a committed relationship?\\
146 - "Hi, Shirley? This is Charlie Harper.\\
147 - "We met at Disneyland about 22 years ago...\\
148 - "Yeah, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. That was me.\\
149 - "Anyway, I just thought I should let you know\\
150 - "I have a girlfriend now,\\
151 - "so I'd appreciate it if you didn't call me.\\
152 - Okay, bye-bye."\\
153 - Well, that takes care of Shirley.\\
154 - Now what about Kandi?\\
155 - You want me to tell her? Fine.\\
156 - I'll tell her.\\
157 - I'll go tell her right now.\\
158 - But before I cut her loose completely,\\
159 - let me float a crazy idea by you.\\
160 - Sort of a win-win... win.\\
161 - Are you out of your freakin' mind?\\
162 - It was worth a shot.\\
163 - Kandi, before you say anything,\\
164 - I just want you to know\\
165 - that I'm in a committed relationship now\\
166 - and I'm-I'm-I'm really in love with this woman.\\
167 - She's the best thing that's ever happened to me,\\
168 - and I can't imagine being with anyone else.\\
169 - Now, sweetie...\\
170 - don't cry.\\
171 - I'm sure you'll find someone else.\\
172 - Bye-bye!\\
173 - Bye-bye.\\
174 - What? I thought we were going upstairs.\\
175 - Okay. You're still mad. I get that.\\
176 - * Men.\\
177 - I made your bed.\\
178 - Thank you.\\
179 - It's been real easy lately.\\
180 - How nice for you.\\
181 - You haven't even been flying solo, have you?\\
182 - That's a little personal, isn't it?\\
183 - Hey, you want privacy, wash your own sheets.\\
184 - Once I get my mitts on 'em,\\
185 - they're in the public domain.\\
186 - Good morning. Morning.\\
187 - How'd it go with Mia last night?\\
188 - Based on his laundry, not well.\\
189 - Why don't you tell the neighbors?\\
190 - Where do you think I'm going?!\\
191 - Oh, by the way, thanks for getting rid of Kandi for me.\\
192 - Hey, I'm your brother. I got your back.\\
193 - Good to know.\\
194 - Hey, as long as we're on the subject,\\
195 - I was wondering...\\
196 - since you're... swimming in Lake Monogamy,\\
197 - as it were...\\
198 - would you mind if I, you know, asked Kandi out sometime?\\
199 - Go for it. Just wanted to make sure you're okay with it.\\
200 - I'm fine with it.\\
201 - I just don't want you to feel weird.\\
202 - Thanks for your consideration.\\
203 - Morning, Huggy Bear!\\
204 - So, Kandi, you want to go out sometime?\\
205 - * Men.\\
206 - Okay, I want you to know I tracked down Kandi.\\
207 - I told her she needs to move on, and she has,\\
208 - so I've got no lifeboats,\\
209 - no life preservers, no water wings.\\
210 - If the ship goes down, I'm going down with it.\\
211 - Charlie...\\
212 - So there's no longer any reason to put off you and me\\
213 - getting naked and rutting like a couple of pigs.\\
214 - Charlie, I'd like you to meet my parents.\\
215 - Hello.\\
216 - What if Dad says I can stay up to watch it?\\
217 - He won't.\\
218 - How do you know?\\
219 - Your father and I talk about these things,\\
220 - so don't try to play us against each other.\\
221 - I got to try. It's what I do.\\
222 - Hi!\\
223 - Hello. Is, uh, Alan here?\\
224 - Father Huggy Bear...!\\
225 - Yes, my child?\\
226 - You've got company.\\
227 - Alan?\\
228 - Stall 'em! Stall 'em! Stall 'em!\\
229 - KANDI: Okay.\\
230 - You must be Jake.\\
231 - Uh-huh.\\
232 - And you must be Jake's grandma.\\
233 - * Men.\\
234 - Judith, hi.\\
235 - Why don't you go watch some cartoons.\\
236 - Okay. Cool!\\
237 - Are you proud of yourself? What do you mean?\\
238 - Oh, please, she has to be half your age.\\
239 - Oh, that.\\
240 - Yeah, I am pretty proud of that.\\
241 - What could you possibly have in common?\\
242 - What do you talk about?\\
243 - Talk? To tell you the truth,\\
244 - we haven't really done a lot of talking.\\
245 - I mean,\\
246 - I-I did hear her confession.\\
247 - She's been a very bad girl.\\
248 - And I'm supposed to leave Jake here?\\
249 - What kind of message does that send him?\\
250 - I don't know, dreams can come true?\\
251 - Life is beautiful? There is a God?\\
252 - Father.\\
253 - I suppose you're the one that introduced Alan\\
254 - to that slutty little... Don't say it, Judith.\\
255 - You'll just be demeaning all women.\\
256 - And yes.\\
257 - Figures. Well, I don't want her around my son.\\
258 - Oh, really? So do I get to screen\\
259 - the men that you're dating?\\
260 - And let's not forget, I know about that guy\\
261 - who delivered the truckload of sod.\\
262 - What about him?\\
263 - It doesn't take two months\\
264 - to put down a new lawn, Judith.\\
265 - Sounds like she got laid before the sod did.\\
266 - I'm not gonna dignify that with a response.\\
267 - Watch out for crabgrass.\\
268 - So what's Kandi, a nun?\\
269 - Mm, Catholic school girl.\\
270 - Oh, excellent choice.\\
271 - Oh, uh, hey, how are things with Mia?\\
272 - Not bad. She forgives me.\\
273 - Introduced me to her parents.\\
274 - Oh, really? How'd that go?\\
275 - Well, you know, those things are always awkward.\\
276 - But the big news is, I'm taking Mia\\
277 - to the Bel Air Hotel tonight, where we will finally\\
278 - express our love for one another in the way that we were meant to.\\
279 - Drunk and in a hurry.\\
280 - You got it.\\
281 - * Men\\
282 - How's the caviar?\\
283 - It's perfect.\\
284 - Everything's perfect.\\
285 - Would you like me to build a fire?\\
286 - Oh, don't go to any trouble.\\
287 - It's no trouble.\\
288 - Luckily, I was a Boy Scout in Beverly Hills.\\
289 - Champagne? No, thanks. I want to be\\
290 - completely present for the first time we make love.\\
291 - Oh. Good for you.\\
292 - Don't you want to be present?\\
293 - Uh, well, within reason.\\
294 - Come on.\\
295 - What do you say we save the champagne?\\
296 - But I already opened it.\\
297 - Do you really need alcohol to make love to me?\\
298 - No, no.\\
299 - I don't need it.\\
300 - Well, then...\\
301 - Is something wrong?\\
302 - I don't know.\\
303 - I mean,\\
304 - we didn't hop into bed on the first date,\\
305 - we've gotten to know each other really well,\\
306 - we're not drinking-- it's all so new to me.\\
307 - That's what makes it special.\\
308 - I just don't want either of us to be disappointed\\
309 - because one of us might not be...\\
310 - throwing their "A" game tonight.\\
311 - Are you nervous?\\
312 - No, no, of course not.\\
313 - But, you know, of the two of us, only one can...\\
314 - fake an "A" game.\\
315 - There's nothing that you could do to disappoint me tonight, Charlie.\\
316 - No. It's what I can't do that might disappoint you.\\
317 - You just relax. I'll be right back.\\
318 - Okay.\\
319 - Why don't you put some music on.\\
320 - Okay.\\
321 - Should I ask?\\
322 - I wish you wouldn't.\\
323 - I'm not supposed to play this game,\\
324 - 'cause my mom says it's too violent.\\
325 - It has to be violent.\\
326 - You can't negotiate with zombies.\\
327 - Don't tell me, tell her.\\
328 - I don't think she likes me.\\
329 - She doesn't really like anybody.\\
330 - Except the guy who keeps putting grass in our backyard.\\
331 - Okay...\\
332 - time for bed.\\
333 - Just a little longer? We're not sleepy!\\
334 - No, him.\\
335 - Oh... I get to stay up.\\
336 - That's not fair! Jake.\\
337 - Just 'cause she's a girl.\\
338 - Want to play?\\
339 - Oh, no, thanks. I-I thought maybe we could just talk.\\
340 - ( chain saw buzzing ) Hang on, let me just saw off this zombie's head.\\
341 - ( zombie shrieking )\\
342 - Good Lord!\\
343 - There we go.\\
344 - Now let me save my work.\\
345 - Okay. All done.\\
346 - Want to have sex?\\
347 - Uh...\\
348 - Uh, actually, I-I do.\\
349 - Um, but, uh, maybe we could spend a little time\\
350 - getting to know each other first.\\
351 - All right.\\
352 - What do you want to know?\\
353 - Uh... well, do you have any brothers or sisters?\\
354 - I do not. How about you?\\
355 - Well... Charlie.\\
356 - Oh, right, Charlie.\\
357 - Uh, do you like to read?\\
358 - Oh, yeah, I love reading. Oh, great, great, me, too.\\
359 - Read anything good lately?\\
360 - You mean like books and magazines, not billboards and text messages, right?\\
361 - Yeah.\\
362 - Then no.\\
363 - Do menus count?\\
364 - Are you ready for me?\\
365 - Mia, if I were any more ready, I'd be done.\\
366 - ( laughs )\\
367 - ( loud bang )\\
368 - Sorry. Are you okay?\\
369 - I think so. Are you sure?\\
370 - Yeah, I'm fine.\\
371 - ( thump ) Ow!\\
372 - Are you okay?\\
373 - Yeah. But I think that's enough foreplay.\\
374 - See, the thing for me was that I never should have gotten married.\\
375 - I was young, I didn't know who I was,\\
376 - and, to be completely honest,\\
377 - I was just afraid of being alone.\\
378 - Wow.\\
379 - Can I share something with you?\\
380 - Uh, yes, please. This is communicating.\\
381 - This is how we connect.\\
382 - You shouldn't tell people that stuff.\\
383 - It makes you sound like a loser.\\
384 - No, it makes me sound like a real human being,\\
385 - a person with feelings and flaws.\\
386 - Tell you what, why don't we just go have sex.\\
387 - Finally!\\
388 - * Men\\
389 - Oh, cheer up.\\
390 - It wasn't that bad.\\
391 - There were... parts of it that I liked.\\
392 - Would you please not go over the game film now?\\
393 - What's the big deal?\\
394 - What's the big deal?\\
395 - This is supposed to be the part of the relationship that I'm good at.\\
396 - You are.\\
397 - It... was... fine.\\
398 - I don't want to hear "fine."\\
399 - I want to see your eyes roll back\\
400 - and the top of your head blow off.\\
401 - This isn't a carnival game,\\
402 - and the object is not just to swing your mallet and ring my bell.\\
403 - Well, we disagree.\\
404 - That's just your ego talking.\\
405 - Charlie, listen to me.\\
406 - I love you, not your money or your car or your house\\
407 - or your skills in bed.\\
408 - What's left?!\\
409 - Charlie... Oh, come on, come on.\\
410 - You're saying that if I was some pencil-weenied guy\\
411 - and living in a shack and taking the bus\\
412 - to my job selling oranges on the freeway off-ramp,\\
413 - you'd still love me?\\
414 - Yes, I would still love you.\\
415 - Okay. I understand now.\\
416 - Good. You're insane.\\
417 - Why, because I love the real you?\\
418 - No, no, because you think there is a real me.\\
419 - Would you believe I loved you if my eyes had rolled back\\
420 - and my head had blown off?\\
421 - It would be a start.\\
422 - All right, I guess we're just gonna have to try again.\\
423 - Hang on, hang on. How am I gonna know\\
424 - you're not faking it just to make me feel better?\\
425 - Honey, if I was gonna fake it, don't you think I would've done it the first time?\\
426 - Fair enough.\\
427 - * Men\\
428 - According to my girlfriend,\\
429 - underneath all the superficial cool stuff in my life,\\
430 - there's actually a real me.\\
431 - Hm, no kidding?\\
432 - Apparently, he's quite a guy.\\
433 - Well, I'd like to meet him sometime.\\
434 - Don't hold your breath.\\
435 - My girlfriend, on the other hand,\\
436 - has no idea who I really am,\\
437 - damn little desire to find out,\\
438 - and is only interested in riding me\\
439 - like a wild mustang and draining me of all bodily fluids.\\
440 - Oh. How do you feel about that?\\
441 - I think I love her.\\
442 - You know what?\\
443 - Love isn't blind,\\
444 - it's retarded.
\subsection {Episode 15: My Tongue is Meat}
1 - Hey, you know what I've been thinking about?\\
2 - What?\\
3 - The death penalty.\\
4 - Really?\\
5 - That's a very complex issue.\\
6 - So what are your thoughts?\\
7 - Well, if you're going to the chair, they got to give you\\
8 - whatever you want for your last meal, right?\\
9 - I guess.\\
10 - I'm gonna order cereal.\\
11 - Why?\\
12 - 'Cause if you keep adding milk, you can make it last forever.\\
13 - And they just got to wait.\\
14 - Okay.\\
15 - Let's go back a bit.\\
16 - Why would you be going to the chair in the first place?\\
17 - I don't know.\\
18 - My DNA shows up at a murder scene.\\
19 - Because it's planted by a crooked cop\\
20 - or maybe one of my teachers.\\
21 - So you'd be wrongly accused.\\
22 - Story of my life, Dad.\\
23 - Remember that water pistol incident at school?\\
24 - But that was your water pistol.\\
25 - Yes, but it wasn't my pee.\\
26 - Morning.\\
27 - Oh, hey, how was your run?\\
28 - Great. We made it all the way to the pier and back.\\
29 - Didn't we, honey?\\
30 - ( panting )\\
31 - Yeah.\\
32 - Pier... back.\\
33 - Hey, Jake, you ever seen anybody cough up blood?\\
34 - No.\\
35 - Then pay attention.\\
36 - Ass.\\
37 - Ass?\\
38 - Kiss...\\
39 - my...\\
40 - sweaty...\\
41 - I think I'll jump in the shower.\\
42 - Do you want to join me?\\
43 - Can't.\\
44 - Later... maybe.\\
45 - All right.\\
46 - Well, you drink your health shake, all right?\\
47 - You'll feel better.\\
48 - Doubt it.\\
49 - What's in that?\\
50 - I don't know.\\
51 - Vitamins, minerals, protein...\\
52 - Whatever it is, it's flushing out stuff I ate in high school.\\
53 - Hey, do you think they let you have a last poop\\
54 - after your last meal?\\
55 - What?\\
56 - 'Cause as long as you're sitting on the can,\\
57 - technically, you're still pooping.\\
58 - And they got to wait.\\
59 - Go get dressed.\\
60 - If they made you hold one in,\\
61 - that'd be cruel and unusual punishment.\\
62 - You know, I am impressed with what you're doing here--\\
63 - exercising, eating right, laying off the cigars and the booze...\\
64 - I mean, Mia has really done wonders with you.\\
65 - Yeah, she's an incredible woman.\\
66 - She is.\\
67 - And I'm a lucky guy. You are.\\
68 - So why is there this little voice\\
69 - in my head that keeps whispering,\\
70 - "Kill yourself! Do it now!"?\\
71 - Don't worry about that.\\
72 - It's very common.\\
73 - Really? Oh, yeah.\\
74 - Every man who gets into a long-term,\\
75 - committed relationship hears that voice.\\
76 - Mine sounded a little like Alec Baldwin.\\
77 - I don't know why. Maybe it's 'cause\\
78 - I enjoyed him so much in that submarine movie.\\
79 - What was that called?\\
80 - Would you get to the point?\\
81 - Well, you have to remember that over time\\
82 - that voice will fade, when you realize\\
83 - that what you're giving up\\
84 - is nothing compared to what you're gaining.\\
85 - What exactly am I gaining?\\
86 - Are you kidding?\\
87 - You're gaining a soul mate,\\
88 - someone to walk down life's path with you,\\
89 - someone who'll always be there sharing your hopes,\\
90 - your joys and your sorrows.\\
91 - You got nothing.\\
92 - It's what the minister said at my wedding.\\
93 - Hunt for Red October!\\
94 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men *\\
95 - * Ah * Men\\
96 - CHARLIE: Back in a while, honey.\\
97 - I'm going for a power walk.\\
98 - MIA: Pace yourself.\\
99 - CHARLIE: Don't worry.\\
100 - ( sighs )\\
101 - This is a good pace.\\
102 - ( door opens )\\
103 - Hey.\\
104 - Whatcha doing?\\
105 - Nothing.\\
106 - Close the damn door.\\
107 - You told Mia you weren't gonna smoke or drink anymore.\\
108 - Yeah, well, you told your father\\
109 - you weren't gonna watch dirty movies on cable anymore.\\
110 - Don't change the subject.\\
111 - Mia's gonna be really pissed at you.\\
112 - Only if she finds out.\\
113 - And she doesn't have to find out.\\
114 - Well, I guess that depends.\\
115 - What, are you blackmailing me?\\
116 - No. I'm just saying if you don't give me 20 bucks,\\
117 - I'm gonna tell on you.\\
118 - That's blackmail.\\
119 - Oh.\\
120 - Well, then, yeah.\\
121 - ( doorbell rings )\\
122 - Hi, Mom, how are you?\\
123 - Deeply hurt.\\
124 - Is this about me or Charlie?\\
125 - Charlie. Great. Come on in.\\
126 - Can you explain to me\\
127 - how your brother can be in a serious relationship,\\
128 - and not only have I not met the woman,\\
129 - he hasn't even bothered to tell me her name?\\
130 - Do you really need an explanation for that?\\
131 - Do you want it to be about you?\\
132 - Her name's Mia. She's in the kitchen.\\
133 - Thank you.\\
134 - Thank God I didn't know Anne Frank.\\
135 - EVELYN: Hello.\\
136 - Hello.\\
137 - ( spaghetti Western music plays )\\
138 - I'm Evelyn, Charlie's mother.\\
139 - I'm Mia, Charlie's girlfriend.\\
140 - So we finally meet.\\
141 - So we do.\\
142 - One question.\\
143 - I'm listening.\\
144 - Can you fix him?\\
145 - I'm trying.\\
146 - ...15, 16, 17...\\
147 - 18... Jake.\\
148 - How about a hug for your grandmommy?\\
149 - No, thank you.\\
150 - ( frustrated sigh )\\
151 - One, two...\\
152 - ( horn honks )\\
153 - What the hell are you doing?!\\
154 - Hey, keep it down, keep it down.\\
155 - Mia thinks I'm taking a power walk.\\
156 - This is a sad, sad day.\\
157 - I always figured you'd be the last guy\\
158 - in the world to end up whipped.\\
159 - I'm not whipped.\\
160 - I'm... considerate.\\
161 - Considerate?\\
162 - Yeah. See, I love Mia and I want her to be happy.\\
163 - And I happen to know she's not happy\\
164 - when I smoke cigars and drink and gamble\\
165 - and stay out all night and eat meat and sugar\\
166 - and grease and fat and... nap and swear\\
167 - and wear shorts and bowling shirts...\\
168 - Oh, Charlie, you're not just whipped,\\
169 - you're roped, saddled and gelded.\\
170 - They could use you to give rides at kids' birthday parties.\\
171 - I am not whipped.\\
172 - Yeah.\\
173 - Here, you might as well take one of these sacks since yours is empty.\\
174 - Hang on a second.\\
175 - That ain't gonna do it, Alice.\\
176 - What?\\
177 - You smell like a beer bottle that just fell out of Joe Camel's ass.\\
178 - Well, what am I supposed to do?\\
179 - Hang on,\\
180 - let's see if I got anything in here that might mask your stench.\\
181 - Oven cleaner? No.\\
182 - Tidy Bowl? No.\\
183 - How do you feel about taking a whore's bath with a hunk of bleu cheese?\\
184 - I'm so proud of him-- he hasn't had a drop of alcohol in weeks.\\
185 - Well, that's one way to go.\\
186 - But I've found that men who drink\\
187 - tend to talk less and sleep more.\\
188 - Which, frankly, becomes increasingly desirable as the years go by.\\
189 - Oh, this can't be good.\\
190 - Hello, darling.\\
191 - Wonderful to see you.\\
192 - Hi, Mom.\\
193 - Have you been dusting?\\
194 - No, why?\\
195 - You reek of Lemon Pledge.\\
196 - You're welcome.\\
197 - * Men...\\
198 - I'll be downstairs.\\
199 - MIA: No snacking, Charlie.\\
200 - We're going to the best vegetarian restaurant in town.\\
201 - Oh, boy!\\
202 - ( imitates bird whistling )\\
203 - ( bird-like cooing )\\
204 - Oh, thank God, meat!\\
205 - I love you, Rose.\\
206 - I love you, too, Charlie.\\
207 - And may I say, I would never try to change you the way she has.\\
208 - Her name's Mia.\\
209 - I know what her name is.\\
210 - I also know where she lives, her employment history,\\
211 - and if you want,\\
212 - I can get you photographs of a wet T-shirt contest\\
213 - she entered during spring break, 1995,\\
214 - at a college bar called Se  or Frogs.\\
215 - I forgot who I'm dealing with.\\
216 - I also know you have to hide from her\\
217 - just to smoke a cigar and slam back a warm beer.\\
218 - What'd you do, bug my garage?\\
219 - Don't be paranoid.\\
220 - I have a long-standing arrangement with Jake.\\
221 - JAKE ( calling ): Charlie, I'm ready.\\
222 - I'm out here!\\
223 - Go, go, go, go, go.\\
224 - Okay, I'll go.\\
225 - But I want you to remember one thing. What?\\
226 - I'm not gonna wait for you forever.\\
227 - How do I look?\\
228 - ( wolf whistle )\\
229 - ( Rose imitates bird cooing )\\
230 - How's your couscous?\\
231 - Yummy.\\
232 - You know, I had quite an interesting chat with your mom today.\\
233 - Yeah, I'm sorry about that.\\
234 - I know she comes on a little strong,\\
235 - but her heart's in the right place.\\
236 - If by the right place you mean in a cooler\\
237 - on its way to a dying man in Tennessee, then we agree.\\
238 - You can't possibly mean that.\\
239 - I suppose not.\\
240 - She's too selfish to donate an organ.\\
241 - Even one she doesn't use.\\
242 - That's so unfair, Charlie.\\
243 - You mother loves you.\\
244 - Really? Did she or did she not say\\
245 - I was a bitter disappointment?\\
246 - Well, she did, but...\\
247 - And did she\\
248 - or did she not say\\
249 - that I'm a lazy-ass schlock jingle writer\\
250 - who wasted 13 years of piano lessons\\
251 - that she paid for by marrying a series of men\\
252 - with large wallets and small penises?\\
253 - Yes, that was mentioned.\\
254 - But it's only natural for someone who loves you\\
255 - to want to see you live up to your potential.\\
256 - I mean, do you really want to be known\\
257 - as the guy who writes songs about adult diapers?\\
258 - Hey, it's better than being known\\
259 - as the guy who wears them.\\
260 - Charlie, we both know you can do so much more\\
261 - with your life.\\
262 - Maybe, but you got to admire my restraint.\\
263 - Well, come on, look how much you've accomplished\\
264 - just since we've been together.\\
265 - You're exercising regularly,\\
266 - you've cut way down on the drinking and you're eating right.\\
267 - Did you ever think you'd be able to change your life the way you have?\\
268 - Never.\\
269 - It just goes to show\\
270 - you can do anything you put your mind to.\\
271 - I smell meat.\\
272 - Excuse me?\\
273 - Your breath. It stinks of meat.\\
274 - Well, it-it-it could be my tongue.\\
275 - My tongue is meat.\\
276 - No, you've been eating meat.\\
277 - I can smell it.\\
278 - Maybe it's this breast of tofurkey you smell.\\
279 - No, I smell beef.\\
280 - Where would I get beef?\\
281 - You tell me.\\
282 - Well, maybe it's secondhand beef.\\
283 - What?\\
284 - You know, like secondhand smoke.\\
285 - Some thoughtless guy is sitting next to you eating a steak, and...\\
286 - Ah, screw it.\\
287 - I paid a slightly disturbed woman\\
288 - to toss a bag of bacon cheeseburgers\\
289 - onto the deck while you were getting dressed.\\
290 - Oh, Charlie.\\
291 - Don't "Oh, Charlie" me.\\
292 - I was starving.\\
293 - And I'll tell you another thing.\\
294 - My power walk was two quick beers\\
295 - and a half a Cuban cigar while cowering in my own garage.\\
296 - That's why you smelled like Lemon Pledge.\\
297 - Well, it certainly wasn't to bring out\\
298 - the natural luster of my forehead.\\
299 - So you've been lying to me?\\
300 - If by lying you mean telling you\\
301 - I wasn't going to do a bunch of things\\
302 - and then doing them anyway and lying about it,\\
303 - then yes, I've been lying to you.\\
304 - Well, I suppose I can forgive you,\\
305 - if you promise it'll never happen again.\\
306 - Oh, it'll never happen again. You know why?\\
307 - Because I am done with this whole charade.\\
308 - I'm tired of you trying to make me over\\
309 - into something I'm not.\\
310 - I'm a grown man, not a work in progress.\\
311 - Charlie, people are staring.\\
312 - Let 'em stare!\\
313 - You guys know what I mean.\\
314 - Why can't women look at a guy for who he is\\
315 - instead of who they can turn him into?\\
316 - Please, you're embarrassing me.\\
317 - Well, good, maybe now you know how I feel--\\
318 - sitting in a restaurant eating\\
319 - medallions of bean curd with lawnmower sauce.\\
320 - Am I right?\\
321 - No man should have to eat anything\\
322 - with the word "curd" in it.\\
323 - You're turning into a real ass here.\\
324 - Well, then I'm finally living up to my potential.\\
325 - I'm a big ol' bourbon-soaked, cigar-huffing ass,\\
326 - as God in His infinite wisdom meant me to be.\\
327 - As He meant all men to be.\\
328 - You guys are disappointing God.\\
329 - Okay, what if a cannibal's on death row?\\
330 - I guess for being a cannibal.\\
331 - And he orders Chinese for his last meal.\\
332 - Does he get to eat a Chinese guy?\\
333 - No.\\
334 - What if they just electrocuted a Chinese guy\\
335 - and the cannibal was next?\\
336 - No.\\
337 - He'd already be cooked.\\
338 - Stop it!\\
339 - Hey.\\
340 - Oh, hey. Where have you been?\\
341 - I had a date with Mia.\\
342 - That was two nights ago.\\
343 - Yeah, well, I stopped off in Vegas on the way home.\\
344 - Why?\\
345 - Because that's where you go\\
346 - after you destroy a relationship.\\
347 - Oh, now I understand why Mia's been calling.\\
348 - She sounded pretty upset.\\
349 - I didn't tell her anything.\\
350 - But you'd tell Rose, wouldn't you?\\
351 - Hey, you just paid me once.\\
352 - Rose has me on something called a retainer.\\
353 - So what happened with Mia?\\
354 - No big deal.\\
355 - I just got tired of trying to be something I'm not.\\
356 - A decent, healthy human being?\\
357 - Pretty much.\\
358 - He's back.\\
359 - You're damn right, I'm back.\\
360 - Mia and I are through.\\
361 - You schmuck.\\
362 - She was the best thing that ever happened to you.\\
363 - But you said I was whipped.\\
364 - I didn't mean dump her. I meant grow a pair.\\
365 - What is "whipped."\\
366 - It's when a man lets a woman\\
367 - take over his life and tell him what to do.\\
368 - Oh, so like you and Mom.\\
369 - ( phone rings )\\
370 - No.\\
371 - Oh, hi, Mother.\\
372 - Uh, no, no, Mia's not here.\\
373 - He, uh, broke up with her.\\
374 - Yeah, schmuck seems to be the general consensus.\\
375 - What's a schmuck?\\
376 - Any guy who's not whipped.\\
377 - She wants to talk to you. Well, I don't want to talk to her.\\
378 - Nice catch, schmuck.\\
379 - Hey, Mom.\\
380 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, why am I the bad guy here?\\
381 - Well, did you ever stop to consider\\
382 - that maybe this wasn't my fault?\\
383 - I got to go, Mom. My meat connection's here.\\
384 - I just think if the guy's got a front door, we should use it.\\
385 - This is fine.\\
386 - Hi, Charlie.\\
387 - Hello, Rose.\\
388 - What's going on?\\
389 - Well, I just wanted to introduce you to Gordon,\\
390 - my new boyfriend.\\
391 - Oh, no kidding?\\
392 - Hiya, Gordon.\\
393 - Hello.\\
394 - Gordon and I are in a committed relationship.\\
395 - Right, Gordon? Um, yeah, I guess.\\
396 - Look, see? There's stairs right over there. Just...\\
397 - Anyway,\\
398 - I was thinking\\
399 - that perhaps you and Mia would like\\
400 - to join us for dinner one night.\\
401 - You know, double date.\\
402 - Oh, well, that's nice, Rose, but I broke up with Mia.\\
403 - Oh, I see.\\
404 - Well, then, good-bye Gordon.\\
405 - * Men.\\
406 - ( TV playing )\\
407 - I think I made a big mistake.\\
408 - I know the feeling.\\
409 - I once ate an egg salad sandwich\\
410 - I left in my desk over the weekend.\\
411 - Huge mistake.\\
412 - My relationship with Mia was the best thing\\
413 - that ever happened to me, and I threw it away.\\
414 - That's what I should have done with the sandwich.\\
415 - I wonder if it's too late to fix things.\\
416 - Call her and find out.\\
417 - Yeah, but if I do, I'll be right back where I started,\\
418 - trying to be somebody I'm not.\\
419 - Okay, then find another girlfriend.\\
420 - I don't want another girlfriend.\\
421 - I want Mia.\\
422 - Then call her.\\
423 - I can't.\\
424 - I can't live with her, I can't live without her.\\
425 - If your plane crashed in the Andes\\
426 - and she died, could you eat her?\\
427 - * Men.\\
428 - Mia, it's Charlie.\\
429 - Look, you win.\\
430 - I'll change. No more meat. I promise.\\
431 - Come on, Mia, come out and smell me.\\
432 - Mia's not here.\\
433 - Do I have to smell you?\\
434 - Who are you?\\
435 - Ginger. So, you're Charlie.\\
436 - Yeah. Where's Mia?\\
437 - Hang on a minute.\\
438 - She told me to give you this if you stopped by.\\
439 - She took a job in New York. Why'd she do that?\\
440 - Just read the note.\\
441 - "I love you too much\\
442 - "to try to make you into something you're not,\\
443 - and I love me too much to settle for who you are."\\
444 - That's the part that always makes me cry.\\
445 - I can change her mind.\\
446 - I'll fly to New York tonight.\\
447 - Do you have her address?\\
448 - Come on in.\\
449 - Can I get you something to drink?\\
450 - No, thanks.\\
451 - Yeah, hi. American Airlines reservations, please.\\
452 - You sure? I got all my boys here.\\
453 - Jack, Johnny and Jose.\\
454 - Maybe a poquito Jose.\\
455 - Hey, are these actual baby back ribs?\\
456 - Yeah, help yourself.\\
457 - Thanks.\\
458 - Yeah, I need to make a reservation\\
459 - for the red-eye to New York tonight.\\
460 - Hey, do you mind if I turn on the TV?\\
461 - I got some money on the Lakers.\\
462 - You bet sports?\\
463 - I'll bet anything.\\
464 - I had 200 bucks on my sister's pregnancy test.\\
465 - How exactly do you know Mia?\\
466 - Oh, we used to do the ballet thing together,\\
467 - but I didn't have the discipline.\\
468 - No kidding?\\
469 - I still dance, but just for tips.\\
470 - Huh.\\
471 - I'll call you back.\\
472 - ( TV playing )\\
473 - You know, I'm thinking she probably needs her space.\\
474 - Probably.\\
475 - Mind if I hang out and watch the game?\\
476 - Be my guest.\\
477 - If you got cash,\\
478 - I could give you a lap dance at halftime.\\
479 - That'd be swell.
\subsection {Episode 16: Ergo, the Booty Call}
1 - Morning.\\
2 - Morning.\\
3 - What are you making?\\
4 - Breakfast.\\
5 - Have you considered orange juice and a piece of toast?\\
6 - It's in there.\\
7 - We got any marshmallows?\\
8 - And he wonders why he gets diarrhea.\\
9 - ( blender whirring, liquid sloshing )\\
10 - Oh, man.\\
11 - You forget to put the lid on again?\\
12 - Maybe.\\
13 - Well, clean it up.\\
14 - Okay.\\
15 - Is Jake up yet?\\
16 - He's in the kitchen.\\
17 - Has he been looking for me?\\
18 - Are you a marshmallow?\\
19 - What?\\
20 - He hasn't been looking for you.\\
21 - Oh, good.\\
22 - Sorry, I'm late,\\
23 - but Kandi and I had morning sex.\\
24 - Good for you.\\
25 - Twice.\\
26 - Congratulations.\\
27 - She didn't even wake me up for the first one.\\
28 - I almost missed it.\\
29 - Well, I've always said a 22-year-old girl\\
30 - is like a good carpenter: no wood gets wasted.\\
31 - Well, I wouldn't put it so crudely, but, yeah.\\
32 - ( yawning )\\
33 - Morning, buddy.\\
34 - Morning.\\
35 - Why do you let him use the blender?\\
36 - I'm hoping he'll eventually stumble into a margarita.\\
37 - Hey, here's a fun fact.\\
38 - You're sleeping with a girl\\
39 - who was born when you were in junior high.\\
40 - And yet there's a good chance\\
41 - she lost her virginity before you did.\\
42 - And here's another fun fact.\\
43 - I'll bet she's had sex with more girls than you, too.\\
44 - That is a fun fact.\\
45 - And you know what else?\\
46 - Here youth is-is like an aphrodisiac.\\
47 - I feel younger.\\
48 - I feel more... oh, I don't know how to describe it.\\
49 - ( laughs ) Manly.\\
50 - I know what you mean.\\
51 - And I am performing at what can only be described\\
52 - as a very enhanced level.\\
53 - Right. You know,\\
54 - between-the-sheets-wise.\\
55 - You don't have to tell me.\\
56 - Yes, I do.\\
57 - I have to tell everybody.\\
58 - Hey, I'm just impressed that you can keep up with her.\\
59 - I thought by now, she'd have worn you down\\
60 - into a few vertebrae and pool of spinal fluid.\\
61 - You know, I exercise, I eat right...\\
62 - ( doorbell rings )\\
63 - And of course, I've always had a vast untapped reservoir\\
64 - of sexual energy bubbling under the surface.\\
65 - Truth be told, you could drill anywhere and hit a gusher.\\
66 - Morning, brother.\\
67 - We're here to tell you about the good news.\\
68 - Yeah, okay, but, my news first.\\
69 - See, I'm dating a 22-year-old woman...\\
70 - incredible.\\

75 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
76 - *Ooh *Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
77 - *Ah. *Men. *Men.\\
78 - Hey, Charlie. Hey, Rose, what's up?\\
79 - I was just takin' a walk on the beach with my boyfriend,\\
80 - and we thought we'd stop by.\\
81 - Come on up, lamb chop.\\
82 - ( grunting ): This is ridiculous.\\
83 - I still don't understand why we can't use the stairs over there.\\
84 - Don't try to change me, Gordon.\\
85 - So, how's it goin' with you two?\\
86 - It's just great.\\
87 - Gordon's my soul mate.\\
88 - He completes me.\\
89 - We're inseparable.\\
90 - Yeah.\\
91 - Wait here. I want to talk to Charlie alone.\\
92 - Charlie.\\
93 - Coming.\\
94 - "Lamb chop"?\\
95 - I'm hot and juicy.\\
96 - What's up?\\
97 - Don't play innocent with me.\\
98 - I can see the hurt in your eyes.\\
99 - What?\\
100 - You have to let me go, Charlie.\\
101 - Okay.\\
102 - I'm with Gordon now.\\
103 - I've moved on.\\
104 - Good.\\
105 - And I know it may be hard for you to hear this,\\
106 - but he satisfies all my needs.\\
107 - Well, he is hot and juicy.\\
108 - Oh, Charlie,\\
109 - I can't bear to see you like this.\\
110 - Like what?\\
111 - I know I shouldn't, but...\\
112 - I'm going to give you one last chance.\\
113 - One last chance for what?\\
114 - You're going to make me say it, aren't you?\\
115 - Say what?\\
116 - Listen closely.\\
117 - Once I go, I'm gone.\\
118 - Really? I've never seen that side of you.\\
119 - I've never had a man like Gordon.\\
120 - I believe you.\\
121 - So?\\
122 - So, what?\\
123 - Who's that?\\
124 - That's Gordon, my boyfriend.\\
125 - How come he's not allowed in?\\
126 - I'm trying to avoid an awkward situation.\\
127 - Too late.\\
128 - You bringing him to my birthday party?\\
129 - Oh, what do you think, Charlie?\\
130 - Is the wound too fresh?\\
131 - I think I can handle it.\\
132 - Cool.\\
133 - Okay, I'm going to go now.\\
134 - All right.\\
135 - But before I do,\\
136 - I think we need to decide just where we stand.\\
137 - You're kidding.\\
138 - Rose has a boyfriend?\\
139 - Yep.\\
140 - A real one or like "Toby the astronaut"?\\
141 - No, this one's real.\\
142 - What's he like?\\
143 - Nice guy.\\
144 - Has no idea how close he is to the wood chipper.\\
145 - KANDI: Hello?\\
146 - Alan, you home?\\
147 - Kandi?\\
148 - What are you doing here?\\
149 - KANDI: I thought I'd surprise you with a booty call.\\
150 - ALAN: Shh!\\
151 - Lower your voice.\\
152 - KANDI ( deep voice ): Booty call.\\
153 - What's a booty call?\\
154 - Well, it's...\\
155 - You know, this is more the kind of thing\\
156 - a-a son should learn from his father.\\
157 - Oh, okay.\\
158 - Maybe you should ask him now.\\
159 - All right.\\
160 - I'm going to hell.\\
161 - Look, it's a really sweet gesture,\\
162 - but this is not a great time.\\
163 - Hey, Dad, what's a booty call?\\
164 - Oh, oh, hey, Jake.\\
165 - You, uh,\\
166 - you remember Kandi.\\
167 - Sure. Hi, Kandi. Hi.\\
168 - So, what's a booty call?\\
169 - I figured you didn't want me telling him.\\
170 - Was I wrong?\\
171 - Uh, uh...\\
172 - uh, well, uh, Jake, it-it means, uh, that...\\
173 - uh, that Kandi came by to-to, uh,\\
174 - to do her laundry.\\
175 - I don't see any laundry.\\
176 - Good-good point, Charlie.\\
177 - Always the eye for detail.\\
178 - Uh... well, uh, you see, Jake, um...\\
179 - in the Old West...\\
180 - uh, uh, cowboys could be out on the dusty range\\
181 - uh, uh, for months at a time,\\
182 - and, uh, they'd get mighty dirty.\\
183 - Um, so, they'd, uh, they'd, uh, mosey into town,\\
184 - uh, with nothing but the clothes on their backs,\\
185 - and they'd need to-to wash 'em.\\
186 - So what they'd do is,\\
187 - uh, they-they would go down to the-the... crick,\\
188 - uh, and strip down\\
189 - until they were wearing nothing but their boots.\\
190 - Why'd they keep their boots on?\\
191 - Rattlesnakes.\\
192 - Uh, anyway, um, in order to warn people who were swimming\\
193 - that, you know, the naked cowboy on his way,\\
194 - he would yell or, uh,\\
195 - or, if you will, call, um...\\
196 - "Booty."\\
197 - "Booty."\\
198 - Ergo, the booty call.\\
199 - Wow, Alan, you really make history fun.\\
200 - Well, thank you.\\
201 - So when did it start meaning casual sex?\\
202 - Um, why don't you go play a video game or something?\\
203 - Okay. Great.\\
204 - Hey, Kandi, you wanna come to my birthday party tomorrow?\\
205 - Sure. How old are you going to be?\\
206 - Twelve. ( gasps ): Happy bar mitzvah.\\
207 - Well, this works out well.\\
208 - When you're not boinkin' her, she's got someone to play with.\\
209 - Charlie, weren't you listening?\\
210 - Jake just invited Kandi to his birthday party.\\
211 - Oh, don't worry.\\
212 - You've still got the inside track.\\
213 - No!\\
214 - I can't let her come to the party.\\
215 - Why not?\\
216 - "Why not?"!\\
217 - My ex-wife is going to be there,\\
218 - all her miserable, middle-aged\\
219 - soccer mom friends are gonna be there.\\
220 - They're going to take one look at Kandi's\\
221 - tight, young, little body,\\
222 - and they're going to hate me.\\
223 - They're going to hate me with a white-hot hatred\\
224 - of burning... hate.\\
225 - Yeah, sure, it'll be a little tense at first,\\
226 - but you can lighten the mood with your booty story.\\
227 - That's powerful funny, pardner.\\
228 - ( feigns laughter ) Shut up.\\
229 - Alan.\\
230 - There comes a time in every man's life\\
231 - when he has to make a choice:\\
232 - does he want to be loved or does he want to get laid?\\
233 - 14 years ago, you made the wrong choice.\\
234 - You got married.\\
235 - And you wound up with neither.\\
236 - But now, now fate has given you another chance.\\
237 - Welcome it.\\
238 - Embrace it.\\
239 - Grab its pert little ass.\\
240 - What am I supposed to do?\\
241 - Walk into my son's birthday and say,\\
242 - "Hey, everybody, look at this gorgeous 22 year-old woman\\
243 - I'm having sex with"?\\
244 - Oh, don't be silly.\\
245 - You don't want to rub their faces in it,\\
246 - you just want them to know where yours has been.\\
247 - Oh, yeah, one more thing.\\
248 - Yeah?\\
249 - Booty! Booty!\\
250 - ( whispering ): Uncle Charlie?\\
251 - Uncle Charlie, you awake?\\
252 - Go away.\\
253 - Don't you want to be the first one\\
254 - to wish me a happy birthday?\\
255 - Jake, I swear to God...\\
256 - Wait, not yet.\\
257 - Five, four, three, two, one.\\
258 - Okay, now.\\
259 - Get out.\\
260 - You can give me your present now if you want to.\\
261 - If you leave immediately,\\
262 - I'll give you the gift of life.\\
263 - All right.\\
264 - Hey, how come Dad's not in his room?\\
265 - He's out with Kandi.\\
266 - When's he coming home?\\
267 - Not for a while.\\
268 - Why doesn't he just have sex with her here?\\
269 - What makes you think he's having sex with her?\\
270 - I don't know, common sense?\\
271 - Look, the thing is,\\
272 - he's embarrassed about having that kind of a relationship\\
273 - with somebody so much younger than him.\\
274 - Why?\\
275 - I don't know, maybe he thinks\\
276 - he's setting a bad example for you.\\
277 - What am I going to do? Start dating a six year-old?\\
278 - Go back to sleep.\\
279 - I can't, I'm too excited.\\
280 - Well, do you mind if I go back to sleep?\\
281 - Okay. I'll find something to do.\\
282 - Great.\\
283 - Maybe I'll try to make a pizza.\\
284 - Good for you.\\
285 - Oh, crap.\\
286 - WOMAN: Pierre?\\
287 - Have you seen Pierre?\\
288 - Is Pierre a cat?\\
289 - Yeah.\\
290 - Bathroom.\\
291 - Thanks.\\
292 - Excuse me.\\
293 - Hey.\\
294 - Hey.\\
295 - Oh, God!\\
296 - Just a little quicker.\\
297 - ( TV cartoons playing )\\
298 - Hey, I'm watching that!\\
299 - Yeah, right.\\
300 - Happy birthday, you big dope.\\
301 - Why am I a big dope?\\
302 - When did you finally fall asleep?\\
303 - How could I possibly know that?\\
304 - And now you got a party starting in a couple hours\\
305 - and you feel like hell, right?\\
306 - Yeah.\\
307 - Happy birthday, you big dope.\\
308 - Hey, am I old enough to have coffee now?\\
309 - You still think armpit farts are funny?\\
310 - Yeah.\\
311 - Then, no.\\
312 - Come on, I could really use a pick-me-up.\\
313 - Okay, how do you want it?\\
314 - I don't know, in a cup?\\
315 - Good choice.\\
316 - Feel better?\\
317 - Yeah, I think it's working.\\
318 - You know, Kandi, you don't have to feel obligated\\
319 - to go to this party.\\
320 - It's just going to be a lot of kids\\
321 - playing silly games.\\
322 - Are there going to be balloon animals?\\
323 - 'Cause I love those!\\
324 - Uh... no, uh...\\
325 - Jake's a little old for that.\\
326 - Balloon animals are\\
327 - a very underappreciated art form, Alan.\\
328 - Just give me a minute to get ready.\\
329 - Okay.\\
330 - You know...\\
331 - it's probably going to be a very, very dull party.\\
332 - I wouldn't be going myself if I weren't related to the kid.\\
333 - And without balloon animals,\\
334 - you got to ask yourself, is it really worth the trip?\\
335 - How do I look?\\
336 - ( gagging )\\
337 - I-I'm sorry, I think I swallowed my tongue.\\
338 - Thank you.\\
339 - It's amazing-- my ex-wife would take hours getting ready,\\
340 - and the end result wouldn't be nearly so...\\
341 - this.\\
342 - Well, maybe I can give her a few tips at the party.\\
343 - Oh, gee.\\
344 - She doesn't respond well to tips.\\
345 - Okay.\\
346 - Anything else?\\
347 - Well...\\
348 - even before I say it, I know it sounds insane,\\
349 - but do you think you could put on a few more clothes?\\
350 - Don't I look okay?\\
351 - Oh, yeah, yeah, you look terrific.\\
352 - It's just...\\
353 - I wouldn't want people to get the wrong idea.\\
354 - About?\\
355 - About...\\
356 - Maybe if you could put on a jacket and a hat.\\
357 - Do you have a poncho?\\
358 - Are you ashamed of me?\\
359 - No. No, I'm proud of you.\\
360 - In fact, I'm so proud that yesterday I almost signed up\\
361 - to be a Christian missionary in the Sudan.\\
362 - But you don't want your family and friends to see me.\\
363 - Oh, good, you understand.\\
364 - You know, Alan, my friends are judgmental, too.\\
365 - About what?\\
366 - About you.\\
367 - None of them get why I'm with you.\\
368 - Well, uh...\\
369 - at the risk of shining a light\\
370 - on something better left unexamined...\\
371 - why are you with me?\\
372 - Because you're cute and smart\\
373 - and really, really grateful.\\
374 - All true.\\
375 - And if my friends can't understand that,\\
376 - well then, tough tomatoes.\\
377 - Kandi, you're a remarkable girl.\\
378 - Thank you.\\
379 - Unfortunately, so am I.\\
380 - Oh, come on, it'll be fun.\\
381 - Want to have a quickie in the car?\\
382 - ( sighs )\\
383 - Well, all right.\\
384 - But this time let's pull over first.\\
385 - Boring!\\
386 - So where's Alan?\\
387 - He's supposed to be pitching in at this party.\\
388 - I don't know, but I'm guessing\\
389 - that wherever he is... he's pitching.\\
390 - So I suppose Charlie hasn't told you\\
391 - that I have a new man in my life.\\
392 - Oh, good for you, dear.\\
393 - Does the man know yet?\\
394 - Get your own, Red!\\
395 - Nice outfit.\\
396 - Thanks.\\
397 - Rose picked it out for me.\\
398 - How about that.\\
399 - Do you know, uh...\\
400 - sometimes when we're having sex,\\
401 - she calls out your name.\\
402 - No kidding.\\
403 - What about the other times?\\
404 - She makes me call it out.\\
405 - Boy... that really wasn't a quickie, was it?\\
406 - The first one was.\\
407 - Anyway, so just to reiterate,\\
408 - today is Jake's day, it's not about us.\\
409 - I know.\\
410 - So maybe you can just relax,\\
411 - and don't feel obligated\\
412 - to, you know, socialize or...\\
413 - talk to anybody.\\
414 - Don't worry, Alan,\\
415 - I'm not going to embarrass you.\\
416 - Right, right, I know you won't.\\
417 - So, to summarize what I reiterated,\\
418 - we're just going to play it cool, low key,\\
419 - nothing to be gained\\
420 - by drawing attention to ourselves.\\
421 - I got it.\\
422 - Don't ring the doorbell!\\
423 - Sorry we're late, but...\\
424 - I was having sex\\
425 - with this gorgeous 22-year-old woman!\\
426 - Wait, wait, wait.\\
427 - Okay.\\
428 - Come in and say that again.\\
429 - Jake, you in here?\\
430 - It's time to do the birthday cake.\\
431 - JAKE: Go away.\\
432 - Did you find him?\\
433 - Yeah, he's in the bathroom.\\
434 - Is he okay?\\
435 - I don't know.\\
436 - Jake, are you okay?\\
437 - JAKE: I'm fine, go away!\\
438 - He's probably humiliated\\
439 - because his father's dating a Campfire Girl.\\
440 - Give it a rest, Judith.\\
441 - What's going on?\\
442 - Jake won't come out of the bathroom.\\
443 - Jake, come on out, honey.\\
444 - I can't.\\
445 - Why not?\\
446 - JAKE: I just can't.\\
447 - I was wondering where everyone snuck off to.\\
448 - Whatever you're saying about me,\\
449 - you can say right to my face.\\
450 - This isn't about you, Mom.\\
451 - ( scoffs )\\
452 - I wish I could believe that.\\
453 - What's the holdup?\\
454 - He won't come out of the bathroom.\\
455 - Is he sick? Who won't come out of the bathroom?\\
456 - Your grandson.\\
457 - Why? Is he mad at me?\\
458 - Jake, honey, what have you had to eat today?\\
459 - JAKE: Just a little coffee and some vitamins.\\
460 - Coffee? You let him have coffee?\\
461 - No! You let him have coffee?\\
462 - He had a sip.\\
463 - Well, wait a second.\\
464 - Why did he take vitamins?\\
465 - JAKE: I was tired.\\
466 - Okay, but where did you find vitamins to take?\\
467 - In your medicine cabinet.\\
468 - I don't have any vitamins in my medicine cabinet.\\
469 - Yeah, you do.\\
470 - The little blue ones with a "V" on them.\\
471 - Ooh...\\
472 - What's going on? I don't understand.\\
473 - The kid's going to need another party hat.
\subsection {Episode 17: The Unfortunate Little Schnauser}
1 - So, any thoughts on what you'd like for dinner this weekend?\\
2 - You decide, honey.\\
3 - I love everything you cook.\\
4 - Oh, so all of a sudden I'm a woman because I cook\\
5 - and try to make a nice home for you?\\
6 - Okay, I heard it, too. Shut up.\\
7 - JAKE: Gangway!\\
8 - Jake!\\
9 - Leave him alone.\\
10 - With his grades,\\
11 - he might as well get used to pushing shopping carts around.\\
12 - Are you saying my son's going\\
13 - to end up working in a supermarket?\\
14 - No, I'm saying he's probably going to end up homeless.\\
15 - Well, as I live and breathe, Charlie Harper.\\
16 - ( sotto voce ): Oh, great.\\
17 - Archie.\\
18 - So how's the best jingle writer in the business?\\
19 - Looks like he's put on a few pounds.\\
20 - Archie, this is my brother, Alan.\\
21 - Alan, Archie Baldwin, the king of the jingle writers.\\
22 - Well, I don't know about that.\\
23 - More like the ayatollah of the jingle writers.\\
24 - The Grand Pooh-Bah, if you will.\\
25 - Really? What's that make you, Charlie?\\
26 - To be honest, a little nauseous.\\
27 - Hey, listen, we should get together sometime,\\
28 - maybe collaborate.\\
29 - I'd like that.\\
30 - Well, sure, there's no downside for you.\\
31 - What the hell.\\
32 - Remind me about it at the awards dinner.\\
33 - Oh, I'm not going to that.\\
34 - Well, why not? You're nominated.\\
35 - What are you nominated for?\\
36 - It's a silly advertising award.\\
37 - Doesn't mean anything.\\
38 - Yeah, he's right.\\
39 - It's not about the trophies, it's about the work.\\
40 - P.S.: My work has won seven trophies.\\
41 - Hey,\\
42 - one more, I'll have a menorah.\\
43 - Well, good luck, Archie, but I think I'll pass.\\
44 - Oh, well, good for you.\\
45 - Stay home and sulk.\\
46 - Nice meeting you.\\
47 - Okay, where do they keep the extra-large condoms?\\
48 - Boy, he's a piece of work.\\
49 - He's a piece of something.\\
50 - Hey, how come you never mentioned\\
51 - that whole awards thing?\\
52 - It's no big deal.\\
53 - I've been nominated plenty of times.\\
54 - Oh. Well, how many times have you won?\\
55 - What difference does it make?\\
56 - So never.\\
57 - Yes, Alan, never.\\
58 - But that guy Archie has won, like, seven times.\\
59 - Yes, he has.\\
60 - Wow, that's got to sting.\\
61 - Hey, Alan, have you ever been beaten to death\\
62 - with a can of corn?\\
63 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
64 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
65 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh, ooh\\
66 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
67 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
68 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
69 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
70 - ( pop rock music playing )\\
71 - * Bad stuff grows in the crack of your toes *\\
72 - * And nobody knows like Toe-Zene *\\
73 - * Itchy feet burn, make you squiggle and squirm *\\
74 - * Get fast relief with Toe-Zene *\\
75 - * Toe-Zene\\
76 - ANNOUNCER: Toe-Zene anti-fungal medication should not be used\\
77 - by pregnant women, people with heart conditions\\
78 - or those who are taking SSI inhibitors.\\
79 - * Toe-Zene.\\
80 - I don't know. This could be my year.\\
81 - I really think it's your best work, Charlie.\\
82 - Thanks.\\
83 - I know I said the same thing\\
84 - about Mr. Herpes Lip Balm.\\
85 - Yeah.\\
86 - Just Like a Woman Natural Douche.\\
87 - And that hemorrhoid cream. What was it called?\\
88 - Fire in the Hole.\\
89 - That was good, but Toe-Zene is the one\\
90 - that's finally going to bring home the gold.\\
91 - Thanks for your support, Rose.\\
92 - You're welcome.\\
93 - Now, can you do something for me?\\
94 - No.\\
95 - Oh, come on, Charlie.\\
96 - I want you to talk to my boyfriend.\\
97 - Why would I want to talk to your boyfriend?\\
98 - Because he's smothering me, and not in the good,\\
99 - "Can you move your thigh off my face" kind of way.\\
100 - I need my space, Charlie.\\
101 - I wake up in the morning and there he is staring at me.\\
102 - I have a bowl of soup,\\
103 - and there he is blowing on it for me.\\
104 - Even when we have sex,\\
105 - I can feel his eyes burning a hole in the back of my head.\\
106 - Oh, that's going to keep me up tonight.\\
107 - You have to explain to him that\\
108 - if you love someone, you have to let them go.\\
109 - If they come back, they're yours.\\
110 - If they don't, then you stalk them.\\
111 - Look, I really don't want to get involved\\
112 - in your love life.\\
113 - Well, if someone doesn't talk to him,\\
114 - we're gonna have to break up.\\
115 - Do what you have to do.\\
116 - Oh, I get it.\\
117 - You want me to be single again.\\
118 - Get him over here.\\
119 - Thank you.\\
120 - Was that so hard?\\
121 - * Men.\\
122 - ( playing soft version of Toe-Zene jingle )\\
123 - I had no idea these awards were so prestigious.\\
124 - They're meaningless crap.\\
125 - Come on. Look at this list of past winners for Best Jingle.\\
126 - Barry Manilow, Randy Newman, Kenny Loggins,\\
127 - Archie Baldwin, Archie Baldwin,\\
128 - Archie Baldwin... ( bangs piano keys )\\
129 - What's your point?\\
130 - My point is it's an honor just to be nominated.\\
131 - No, no, it's an honor to win.\\
132 - Being nominated\\
133 - is just a soul-sucking waste of time.\\
134 - Why are you so sure you're going to lose?\\
135 - Because it doesn't matter who wrote the best jingle.\\
136 - It's about who has the sexiest product.\\
137 - That's why the awards always go to car and beer ads.\\
138 - Over-the-counter medications just aren't hip enough.\\
139 - That hardly seems fair.\\
140 - Tell me about it.\\
141 - Encourage people to get drunk and drive fast, great,\\
142 - here's an award.\\
143 - Relieve the heartbreak of vaginal itching?\\
144 - They don't even want to shake your hand.\\
145 - Well, win or lose, you should still go to the ceremony.\\
146 - No, no, no, no, no.\\
147 - An awards ceremony is like a Thai massage.\\
148 - If you don't know that there's going to be a happy ending,\\
149 - there's no point in lying down.\\
150 - It's not just about you, Charlie.\\
151 - You have a family\\
152 - who's proud of your accomplishments\\
153 - and might like the chance to share them.\\
154 - What family is that?\\
155 - Your family: me, Jake, Mom.\\
156 - Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
157 - Do not tell Mom about this nomination.\\
158 - Why? It's a good thing.\\
159 - It doesn't matter.\\
160 - If it's a good thing, she'll find a way to make it bad.\\
161 - Okay, now you're just being ridiculous.\\
162 - Oh, really.\\
163 - Let's try a little experiment.\\
164 - I'll pretend I'm Mom\\
165 - and you tell me something good.\\
166 - All right. Um,\\
167 - hey, Mom, I have discovered a cure for cancer.\\
168 - Very nice.\\
169 - Shame you couldn't do it in time\\
170 - to save Uncle Walter's left testicle.\\
171 - Come on. Give me another one.\\
172 - No, I get the idea.\\
173 - No, hit me.\\
174 - Okay, um...\\
175 - Gee, Mom, it really is a beautiful day, huh?\\
176 - Try telling that to Uncle Walter's one good nut.\\
177 - Okay. Um, I adore my son.\\
178 - Somebody has to.\\
179 - How about friendship?\\
180 - How about Judas?\\
181 - Family. Manson.\\
182 - Puppies. Rabies.\\
183 - Love. Communicable disease.\\
184 - You win.\\
185 - Quitter! Leave me alone.\\
186 - You're already alone.\\
187 - Your wife threw you out, remember?\\
188 - * Men.\\
189 - ROSE: Damn it, Gordon!\\
190 - Get up there and talk to Charlie.\\
191 - GORDON: But I don't want to talk to Charlie.\\
192 - ROSE: Do you like having sex with me, Gordon?\\
193 - Hey, Charlie.\\
194 - Hey, Gordon.\\
195 - What's going on?\\
196 - Oh, not much.\\
197 - I was just passing by.\\
198 - Thought I'd see how you're doing.\\
199 - I'm doing fine.\\
200 - Good.\\
201 - Good...\\
202 - Nice shirt.\\
203 - Right back at ya.\\
204 - So...\\
205 - Rose says I have to talk to you,\\
206 - or I can't have sex with her anymore.\\
207 - I see.\\
208 - You sure you're making the right choice?\\
209 - Call me crazy.\\
210 - Well, crazy is the price of admission for that ride.\\
211 - Okay, come here, sit down.\\
212 - Oh.\\
213 - You want a beer?\\
214 - Oh, no, thank you.\\
215 - I'm a really mean drunk.\\
216 - I sensed that.\\
217 - Anyway, the thing you need to understand about Rose--\\
218 - about any woman really is--\\
219 - they want what they can't have.\\
220 - But Rose can have me.\\
221 - Trust me on this, Gordon.\\
222 - Play it cool, keep your distance, be aloof,\\
223 - you'll have to call the cops to get rid of her.\\
224 - You really think so?\\
225 - I know so.\\
226 - But they won't come right away.\\
227 - She'll still have time\\
228 - to hot glue her high school graduation picture\\
229 - to your freshly shaved ass.\\
230 - * Men.\\
231 - Hey, Mom,\\
232 - here's some good news.\\
233 - It seems with medical breakthroughs,\\
234 - the average lifespan will soon be a hundred years.\\
235 - Wonderful. More time to be ignored by your children.\\
236 - Amazing.\\
237 - Morning, Mom.\\
238 - You're looking very pretty today.\\
239 - That's nice, because inside I'm dead.\\
240 - When you're right, you're right.\\
241 - Charlie, I need a favor.\\
242 - Yeah, well, I need a healthy liver,\\
243 - and there's a long waiting list for both.\\
244 - I've got a client coming into town next Saturday,\\
245 - and he's bringing his lovely daughter.\\
246 - Uh, and by "lovely," she means "dog-like."\\
247 - All right, she may not be a beauty queen,\\
248 - but she does have a terrific figure.\\
249 - I'm guessing six nipples.\\
250 - Anyhow, I was hoping you could show her a good time.\\
251 - No big deal.\\
252 - You don't even have to take her to dinner.\\
253 - Just go to the beach and throw a stick\\
254 - till she gets tired.\\
255 - Gee, Mom, as much as I'd love\\
256 - to service the unfortunate little schnauzer,\\
257 - I'm busy next Saturday.\\
258 - What are you doing?\\
259 - I've... I've...\\
260 - I've got a... uh... I got a... I got a thing.\\
261 - Don't lie to me, Charlie. You've got nothing.\\
262 - You just don't want to help me.\\
263 - No, no, no, no. I...I... I swear.\\
264 - I have... I have... I have plans.\\
265 - I'm... I'm... I'm going to this...\\
266 - this awards ceremony.\\
267 - You never go to these things.\\
268 - Yeah, well, this year's different.\\
269 - Your client's daughter will just have\\
270 - to hump somebody else's leg.\\
271 - Told you I could get him to go.\\
272 - This is really boring.\\
273 - Keep it to yourself, Jake.\\
274 - I just don't understand why I had to come.\\
275 - You're here to support your Uncle Charlie,\\
276 - the same way he supported you\\
277 - by going to your Christmas pageant this year.\\
278 - You remember the one, where you stood in back\\
279 - picking lint off your antlers\\
280 - while the rest of the class\\
281 - recited "The Night Before Kwanzaa."\\
282 - Oh, yeah. Uncle Charlie?\\
283 - What?\\
284 - Now you have to come to my Easter pageant.\\
285 - This event isn't televised, is it?\\
286 - No.\\
287 - Hmm. Well, I guess they only show the important awards.\\
288 - Congratulations.\\
289 - You've just been elected tonight's designated driver.\\
290 - Come on, just ignore her.\\
291 - Ignore her? It would be easier to ignore blood in my urine.\\
292 - Well, well, well.\\
293 - Look who decided to be a good sport.\\
294 - Speaking of blood in my urine.\\
295 - Hey, Archie.\\
296 - Hey, I want to tell you people,\\
297 - this man has been a real inspiration to me.\\
298 - No, come on.\\
299 - No, no. I mean it.\\
300 - Whenever I'm struggling to write a jingle\\
301 - and I feel like I'm not measuring up,\\
302 - I ask myself, how would Charlie Harper write this?\\
303 - And the answer always makes me feel better about my own work.\\
304 - So, Charlie, aren't you going to introduce me?\\
305 - Mom, Archie. Archie, Mom.\\
306 - You're Charlie's mother?\\
307 - Oh, a teenage pregnancy, no doubt.\\
308 - How brave of you to keep him.\\
309 - Well, aren't you adorable.\\
310 - Mom, Archie is nominated in the same category as Charlie.\\
311 - Oh.\\
312 - Well, I'll be rooting for you, Archie.\\
313 - Okay, then, thanks for stopping by.\\
314 - Good luck.\\
315 - You deserve it this year.\\
316 - Thanks.\\
317 - I mean, how many times can they snub you?\\
318 - I don't really keep track.\\
319 - Seven.\\
320 - Seven years in a row.\\
321 - If you say so.\\
322 - Hey, stick around after the ceremony.\\
323 - If I win, I'll let you hold my trophy.\\
324 - Not to mention the little statue they give me.\\
325 - Isn't the little statue the trophy?\\
326 - Just eat your chicken.\\
327 - And now, before we present the Jingle of the Year Award,\\
328 - we have a special treat.\\
329 - Please tell me they're gonna pass out guns.\\
330 - Our very own seven -time award winner,\\
331 - here to perform his own nominated tune,\\
332 - composed especially for the United Nations'\\
333 - Save-an-Orphan program...\\
334 - Oh, God, not orphans.\\
335 - Archie Baldwin!\\
336 - Oh, goodie.\\
337 - ( piano playing gentle tune )\\
338 - This is for all the orphans out there.\\
339 - * There's no tree at Christmastime *\\
340 - * No pumpkin Hallow's Eve\\
341 - * No candles on the birthday cake *\\
342 - * No reason to believe\\
343 - * He works all day in a cold, dark mine *\\
344 - * His little lungs filled with soot *\\
345 - * Her mom is Kim Jong's concubine *\\
346 - * Her dad was killed by the Tonton Macoute *\\
347 - * Save the orphans\\
348 - * Ah... *\\
349 - * Save the orphans\\
350 - * Don't do it for me\\
351 - * Don't do it for you\\
352 - * Do it for little Kim Sung, ( clicking noise ) and Abu *\\
353 - * Save the orphans\\
354 - * Ah... * Come on, everybody!\\
355 - * Save the orphans * Ah... *\\
356 - Tax deductible!\\
357 - * Save the orphans\\
358 - * Save the orphans\\
359 - * Save the orphans\\
360 - Woody Allen can't marry them all!\\
361 - * Save the orphans\\
362 - Some of them don't even have parents!\\
363 - * Save the orphans\\
364 - Get two, get one free!\\
365 - * Save the orphans\\
366 - You're the ones paying for scholarships!\\
367 - * Save the orphans...\\
368 - * Save the orphans *\\
369 - * Ah...\\
370 - * Save the orphans\\
371 - * Ah...\\
372 - Enough!\\
373 - But it's catchy.\\
374 - So is diphtheria.\\
375 - How come you don't get a runner-up trophy?\\
376 - 'Cause I don't.\\
377 - In school, everybody gets a trophy just for participating.\\
378 - Well, Jake, that's the difference\\
379 - between school and life.\\
380 - In life, all you get for participating\\
381 - is pain, loneliness and death.\\
382 - ( car horn honks )\\
383 - Better luck next year, Charlie!\\
384 - Good night, boys.\\
385 - Oh, yeah, I forgot.\\
386 - There's also crushing humiliation.\\
387 - Huh.\\
388 - Well, in sixth grade, you get a trophy.\\
389 - * Men.\\
390 - Hey.\\
391 - Can I get you anything?\\
392 - A length of rope and a rickety stool?\\
393 - Charlie, it's understandable\\
394 - that you might be a little blue right now.\\
395 - But that will pass.\\
396 - Get out of here, Alan.\\
397 - You know, I often find\\
398 - that when things look darkest,\\
399 - it really helps to share your...\\
400 - I swear, I will drop-kick you over that railing.\\
401 - All right.\\
402 - Pleasant dreams.\\
403 - You don't dream in a blackout, you moron.\\
404 - Hey, Charlie.\\
405 - Oh, God.\\
406 - How'd it go tonight?\\
407 - Well, let me put it this way:\\
408 - What the advertising community did to me earlier this evening,\\
409 - Archie Baldwin is now doing to my mother.\\
410 - He's not acknowledging her wonderful talent?\\
411 - Just leave it alone, Rose.\\
412 - Sorry.\\
413 - Have you seen Gordon?\\
414 - Not since I talked to him.\\
415 - And by the way, thanks for that opportunity.\\
416 - I've always wanted to bond with a pasty kid who dresses like me.\\
417 - Well, I don't know what you said to him,\\
418 - but he's been acting very strange, lately.\\
419 - Lately?\\
420 - I keep calling, but he doesn't pick up the phone.\\
421 - And when I leave a message, he doesn't call back.\\
422 - I thought you wanted him to stop being so clingy.\\
423 - I thought I did, too, but now I miss his cute little face\\
424 - peeking at me while I'm washing my hair, shaving my legs,\\
425 - soaping up my breasts, which you no doubt remember\\
426 - are extremely firm and perky.\\
427 - So he spies on you in the shower?\\
428 - No. That would be weird.\\
429 - Why is love so complicated?\\
430 - I don't know, Rose.\\
431 - Stuff happens.\\
432 - Oh, Charlie,\\
433 - you always know the right thing to say.\\
434 - Well, this is a fine kettle of fish.\\
435 - Oh, why can't I just black out in peace?\\
436 - "Be aloof," you said. "Play hard to get."\\
437 - You just wanted me out of your way so you could make your move.\\
438 - You caught me, Gordon.\\
439 - Now do the right thing and kill me.\\
440 - Oh, Charlie, is this true?\\
441 - Is this part of some devious plan to win me back?\\
442 - You heard her, Gordon.\\
443 - Kill me.\\
444 - Rose, you wanted him out of your hair,\\
445 - I got him out of your hair.\\
446 - You wanted to get rid of me?\\
447 - No. I just need some space.\\
448 - You want space?\\
449 - I'll give you all the space you want. Fine.\\
450 - In fact, I'll leave right now.\\
451 - Well, great, I'll just stay here with Charlie.\\
452 - Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
453 - Nobody leaves.\\
454 - Nobody stays.\\
455 - Rose, get off me.\\
456 - Okay, now, everybody listen carefully,\\
457 - 'cause I'm pretty sure I'm only gonna be able to say this once.\\
458 - Rose, think about it.\\
459 - Where are you gonna find a guy who loves you as much as Gordon?\\
460 - And Gordon, where are you gonna find a girl...\\
461 - period?\\
462 - The man makes sense, Rose.\\
463 - Damn right, I make sense.\\
464 - If you kids don't patch things up,\\
465 - you know what's gonna happen?\\
466 - You're gonna wind up old, miserable and alone.\\
467 - He's right, Gordon.\\
468 - Look what happened to him.\\
469 - I love you, Rose.\\
470 - I love you, too.\\
471 - Oh, good, a happy ending.\\
472 - Get the hell off my deck.\\
473 - Come on, lamb chop, let's go home.\\
474 - Hold on.\\
475 - Climbing over the rail is ridiculous and juvenile.\\
476 - From now on,\\
477 - I want to take the stairs.\\
478 - Do you like having sex with me, Gordon?\\
479 - Call me crazy.\\
480 - ( clapping )\\
481 - And the real winner tonight is Charlie Harper,\\
482 - a man with a heart so big\\
483 - that he'd step outside of his own misery\\
484 - to help two people in need.\\
485 - Alan, I'm warning you.\\
486 - Now, I know you don't want to hear this,\\
487 - but let me tell you something.\\
488 - The Archie Baldwins of this world are soon forgotten.\\
489 - It's people like you, people who are selfless and generous,\\
490 - who will live on forever.\\
491 - Last chance.\\
492 - Oh, please.\\
493 - That Grumpy Gus routine is not...\\
494 - Good night.
\subsection {Episode 18: The Spit-Covered Cobbler}
1 - Alan, I forgot my toothbrush, can I use yours?\\
2 - Oh, dear Lord, no.\\
3 - Do you have any idea how many bacteria\\
4 - can be transferred from mouth to mouth\\
5 - on a toothbrush?\\
6 - I don't know. How many?\\
7 - Okay, I-I-I don't know the actual amount...\\
8 - Then why'd you bring it up?\\
9 - Poor judgment.\\
10 - The point is,\\
11 - sharing these things is a bad idea.\\
12 - Are you saying you don't want\\
13 - your toothbrush in my mouth, 'cause, Alan...\\
14 - I know, I know.\\
15 - I get the hypocrisy.\\
16 - Just... just humor me.\\
17 - Okay, I have, um...\\
18 - I have hard, medium or soft bristles.\\
19 - Uh, I have straight or curved handles,\\
20 - and, uh, for your flossing needs,\\
21 - I have, uh, waxed, mint-waxed, unwaxed,\\
22 - and if you're feeling especially adventurous,\\
23 - may I suggest the cinnamon?\\
24 - Maybe I'll just wait till I get home.\\
25 - No, no, no, no, no, no.\\
26 - One day you skip brushing, and before you know it,\\
27 - your teeth rot away and you're begging strangers\\
28 - to start your apple.\\
29 - Fine. I'll take the pink one.\\
30 - I always wondered,\\
31 - what's the little rubber thing\\
32 - at the end for?\\
33 - Oh, it's to massage your gums.\\
34 - Oh. I thought it might be an eraser...\\
35 - but who writes when they're brushing their teeth?\\
36 - I-I-I don't know.\\
37 - What's the matter?\\
38 - Oh, nothing, nothing.\\
39 - Well, I-I-I kind of have to pee.\\
40 - Go ahead.\\
41 - Oh, no, no, I'll wait till you're finished.\\
42 - Are you shy about peeing in front of me, 'cause, Alan...\\
43 - Again, I get the hypocrisy.\\
44 - I-I-I just think it's important\\
45 - to keep a little mystery in a relationship.\\
46 - It's just peeing, Alan.\\
47 - Not necessarily.\\
48 - Um, sometimes when a man urinates,\\
49 - other muscles see that as a green light to relax.\\
50 - So you've never peed in front of a girl?\\
51 - Uh, well, my ex-wife,\\
52 - but, uh, after six, seven years of marriage,\\
53 - who gives a damn anymore?\\
54 - Okay.\\
55 - I'll brush out here. Thank you.\\
56 - Ouch!\\
57 - ALAN: What?\\
58 - One of my teeth hurts when I brush it.\\
59 - Well, when was the last time you saw a dentist?\\
60 - Alan, I see people all the time.\\
61 - They don't always tell you what they do.\\
62 - Hey, are you... are you done?\\
63 - 'Cause I got to rinse.\\
64 - No, I... I can't go\\
65 - when I know you're listening.\\
66 - Would it help if I sang the pee-pee song?\\
67 - Uh, the what?\\
68 - My mom used to sing it to me.\\
69 - * Tinkle, tinkle, little star\\
70 - * In the potty, not the car\\
71 - * Up above the bowl so high\\
72 - * Like the raindrops in the sky... *\\
73 - Hey, hey, it's working!\\
74 - ( Alan passes gas )\\
75 - Oops, green light.\\
76 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
77 - * Oh... * Men.\\
78 - ( engine grinding to turn over ) ALAN: Okay, okay, stop, stop, stop.\\
79 - ( engine noise stops ) KANDI: Should I try it again?\\
80 - ALAN: Uh, not yet. Okay, now.\\
81 - ( engine grinding to turn over ) ALAN: Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop.\\
82 - ( engine noise stops ) Morning.\\
83 - ALAN: Morning.\\
84 - KANDI: Morning, Charlie!\\
85 - Need any help?\\
86 - Do you know how to get a 1981 Plymouth Duster moving?\\
87 - Yeah, yank out the eight-track\\
88 - and push it off a cliff.\\
89 - ( mock guffawing )\\
90 - You're useless.\\
91 - Sure.\\
92 - Hey, you got a little grease on your face. Where?\\
93 - Cheek.\\
94 - Oh.\\
95 - Did I get it?\\
96 - Mm, no, there's some more.\\
97 - Now?\\
98 - Little on your forehead.\\
99 - Yeah?\\
100 - Perfect.\\
101 - Now sing "Swanee River."\\
102 - KANDI: Alan, should I try it again?\\
103 - Uh, no. I'm going to call Triple-A.\\
104 - KANDI: Good. No sense drinking over this.\\
105 - You must be so proud.\\
106 - Hey, hey, she may not be sophisticated,\\
107 - but she's street smart.\\
108 - Sesame Street smart.\\
109 - Just leave it alone.\\
110 - Let me ask you something.\\
111 - Have you stopped to consider the long-term cost\\
112 - of a relationship with a girl that young?\\
113 - Charlie, it's a free tow.\\
114 - Oh, sure, that's how it always starts--\\
115 - with a free tow-- but who's going to pay\\
116 - to fix the car after it's towed?\\
117 - Um...\\
118 - "Um" is right, my dim-witted friend,\\
119 - and that's just the beginning.\\
120 - Girls like Kandi need all kinds of stuff,\\
121 - and the only way they can pay for it\\
122 - is through horny morons like you.\\
123 - So her car breaks down, and I should just dump her?\\
124 - This is a short-term relationship, right?\\
125 - I don't know... Trust me, it's a short-term relationship.\\
126 - I mean, Kandi's not the brightest bulb\\
127 - in the chandelier, but even she's going\\
128 - to wake up one day and wonder\\
129 - what she's doing shacked up\\
130 - with a penniless putz who's twice her age.\\
131 - Kandi's not like that.\\
132 - Just wait.\\
133 - Your first minor stroke, and she'll be boinking\\
134 - the cardiologist before you can scrawl\\
135 - "What happened?" on your notepad.\\
136 - Okay, for the sake of argument,\\
137 - let's say you're right.\\
138 - What's your point?\\
139 - My point is, you don't dry clean a rented tuxedo.\\
140 - You don't redecorate a hotel room.\\
141 - You don't order cable for a port-a-potty...\\
142 - unless you're really, really drunk.\\
143 - And you don't take on the bills of a girl\\
144 - that's got the attention span\\
145 - of a monkey chewing on a fly swatter.\\
146 - Okay, I-I-I appreciate your-- how shall I describe it--\\
147 - compassionate advice, but all I'm doing here\\
148 - is arranging for a free tow for a friend.\\
149 - ( snapping noise outside )\\
150 - Alan, I don't think the engine's flooded anymore.\\
151 - Fire extinguisher? Under the sink.\\
152 - Thank you.\\
153 - Hey, you know, if you don't hurry up,\\
154 - you'll be late for school.\\
155 - I don't mind.\\
156 - Okay, well, that takes the pressure off.\\
157 - How come my dad's not bringing me?\\
158 - He's helping Kandi get her car fixed.\\
159 - Aw, geez. And him already broker than a headless hooker.\\
160 - Hey, how come my mom hates Kandi?\\
161 - What gave you the idea that she hates her?\\
162 - 'Cause she says so...\\
163 - a lot.\\
164 - All right.\\
165 - Why do you think?\\
166 - I don't know.\\
167 - She's pretty, she's fun, and Dad seems real happy with her.\\
168 - Well, little man, you just answered your own question.\\
169 - I did? What'd I say?\\
170 - It's like this.\\
171 - You ever see a kid at school who doesn't like his lunch\\
172 - but he won't let you have it, either?\\
173 - Oh, yeah. Russell Beasley.\\
174 - He'll spit on his apple cobbler\\
175 - before he'll let anybody else eat it.\\
176 - Well, this is pretty much the same deal,\\
177 - except your mom is Russell Beasley,\\
178 - and your dad is the spit-covered cobbler.\\
179 - I don't understand.\\
180 - Even though your mom doesn't want your dad,\\
181 - she doesn't want Kandi to eat him, either.\\
182 - Oh.\\
183 - You know, I like cobbler with ice cream.\\
184 - Way to follow a train of thought.\\
185 - Thanks.\\
186 - Well, I guess we should go to school now, huh?\\
187 - Couldn't hurt.\\
188 - I'll see if can find my books.\\
189 - Sweet kid.\\
190 - Yeah.\\
191 - Shame he'll never be\\
192 - anything more than a burden to society.\\
193 - Yeah.\\
194 - Do you know a good lawyer, Alan?\\
195 - No, but my ex-wife does.\\
196 - Why?\\
197 - 'Cause I want to sue the guy who sold me that lemming.\\
198 - Y-You mean lemon.\\
199 - I do?\\
200 - Okay.\\
201 - Did-did you get any kind of a-a written guarantee\\
202 - when you bought it?\\
203 - No, it was more of an oral agreement.\\
204 - All right, Mr. Harper,\\
205 - I've looked at your daughter's vehicle.\\
206 - She's, uh... she's not my daughter.\\
207 - Oh.\\
208 - Good for you.\\
209 - Anyway, the prognosis looks rather bleak.\\
210 - I-I understand.\\
211 - I mean, the vehicle was on fire.\\
212 - I know.\\
213 - What is she, like, 21?\\
214 - Twenty-two.\\
215 - And a half.\\
216 - Good for you.\\
217 - Yeah, yeah, but what about the car?\\
218 - Oh, the car?\\
219 - The car's got to be 25, 26 years old.\\
220 - I mean, can it be fixed?\\
221 - Anything can be fixed.\\
222 - Hell, they put a pig's heart in my Uncle Vinnie.\\
223 - How much?\\
224 - All of it.\\
225 - My Aunt Phyliss likes to call him the other white meat now.\\
226 - No, I-I mean, how much to fix the car?\\
227 - For you, three grand.\\
228 - What?!\\
229 - Once again, the car was on fire.\\
230 - I had to wait an hour\\
231 - before I could even touch it.\\
232 - But I only paid $800 for it.\\
233 - Eight hundred dollars?\\
234 - Well, dear heart, I hate to be the bearer of sad tidings,\\
235 - but there's a chance some unscrupulous businessperson\\
236 - has taken advantage of your good nature.\\
237 - Boy, that happens a lot.\\
238 - Well, $3,000 is out of the question.\\
239 - It'd make more sense just to get her a new car.\\
240 - Oh, Alan, thank you!\\
241 - That's the sweetest thing anybody's ever done for me!\\
242 - Good for you.\\
243 - Hey.\\
244 - Hey.\\
245 - Why isn't your car in the garage?\\
246 - I, uh... I loaned it to Kandi.\\
247 - Ah.\\
248 - And how much are you paying to fix hers?\\
249 - For your information, nothing.\\
250 - Nothing?\\
251 - Not a cent.\\
252 - I'm leasing her a Saturn.\\
253 - Tell me again about the free tow, Alan.\\
254 - Come on, she-she needs a car,\\
255 - and-and-and the lease terms are surprisingly reasonable.\\
256 - They're practically giving them away.\\
257 - Excuse me.\\
258 - Where are you going?\\
259 - I'm going to solve all your problems.\\
260 - Do you want to see it coming, or should I surprise you?\\
261 - ( mock guffawing )\\
262 - You're not funny.\\
263 - ( phone rings )\\
264 - Hello?\\
265 - Hang on a second.\\
266 - It's your dentist.\\
267 - He wants to talk to you about Kandi's teeth.\\
268 - Thank you.\\
269 - Hi, Dr. Weinberger.\\
270 - Thanks for seeing her on such short notice.\\
271 - Can I have some privacy, please?\\
272 - Sure. Get your own place.\\
273 - No, she's not covered under my dental plan.\\
274 - Twenty-two and a half.\\
275 - Yeah, yeah, good for me.\\
276 - Did you get a chance to look at her tooth?\\
277 - Oh, oh, a-a-a-a root canal.\\
278 - Well, well, how much is that?\\
279 - Yow.\\
280 - Well, wh-what do you mean, there's more?\\
281 - Who told you to look at her wisdom teeth?\\
282 - That girl's got wisdom teeth?\\
283 - Okay, what's the worst thing that can happen\\
284 - if you don't take them out?\\
285 - How infected?\\
286 - All right, i-i-if it has to be done,\\
287 - it has to be done.\\
288 - Yeah, send me the bill.\\
289 - Okay, bye-bye.\\
290 - Here, aim for the cheap seats.\\
291 - CHARLIE: Alan?\\
292 - What are you doing?\\
293 - ( panting ): Well, I'm in a little bit of a-a cash flow crunch,\\
294 - and I, uh... I thought I'd use this to-to pay some bills.\\
295 - I see.\\
296 - Mind helping me out?\\
297 - Sure.\\
298 - Promise me you'll spend it on food, not whiskey.\\
299 - My pain brings you a lot of pleasure, huh?\\
300 - I'm a simple man.\\
301 - ( phone rings )\\
302 - It's your ex-wife.\\
303 - Oh, perfect. Get the bat.\\
304 - This is the bat.\\
305 - Hello?\\
306 - Oh, oh, good. I-I was hoping it'd be you.\\
307 - What? Of course I remember the Alamo.\\
308 - Oh, oh, oh, you mean alimo-ny.\\
309 - ( laughing )\\
310 - I was... I was thinking,\\
311 - uh, Davey Crockett, Jim Bowie...\\
312 - Oh, oh, come on, Judith,\\
313 - why can't we share a few chuckles?\\
314 - Oh, oh, no, no, I-I agree.\\
315 - There's nothing chuckle-worthy about a subpoena.\\
316 - Well, you know what? I will tell you what.\\
317 - Uh, I will bring you the check,\\
318 - uh, when I pick up Jake.\\
319 - I-I-I promise.\\
320 - O-O-Okay, okay, bye-bye now.\\
321 - You've got to pick up Jake.\\
322 - Why?\\
323 - 'Cause I don't have her money.\\
324 - It's in Kandi's mouth and-and-and Kandi's car.\\
325 - What about the treasure of the Sierra Madre over there?\\
326 - This?\\
327 - This is nothing.\\
328 - One car payment and maybe a bikini wax.\\
329 - Bikini wax?\\
330 - A girl's got to keep those up.\\
331 - It's a landscaping issue.\\
332 - You just got to buy me some time with Judith.\\
333 - What are you going to do with more time?\\
334 - You can't sell your blood; your ex-wife already took that.\\
335 - And if you sell your sperm,\\
336 - what's the point in dating Kandi?\\
337 - Well, uh, for your information, I-I do have other options.\\
338 - Like what?\\
339 - Well, I've been looking at,\\
340 - uh, uh, part-time work,\\
341 - and, uh, I have some very promising auctions on eBay.\\
342 - Oh, really. What are you auctioning?\\
343 - Well, a-a few rare books,\\
344 - a couple of lithos, a set of golf clubs...\\
345 - Since when do you play golf?\\
346 - Uh, well, technically, they're your clubs.\\
347 - You're stealing from me?!\\
348 - Oh, come on, you only bought 'em\\
349 - so you could go to Palm Springs and pick up lesbians.\\
350 - This is ridiculous.\\
351 - Why don't you just ask me to lend you some money?\\
352 - Would you lend me money?\\
353 - Absolutely...\\
354 - if I hadn't taken a bath on the Super Bowl.\\
355 - Well, I-I need to do this by myself anyway.\\
356 - You know, I-I still have my pride.\\
357 - Wow. You really think that, huh?\\
358 - Well, it doesn't matter as long as I have Kandi.\\
359 - She looks up to me.\\
360 - She-she thinks I'm special.\\
361 - She thinks I'm smart.\\
362 - She thinks gazpacho is Pinocchio's father.\\
363 - What can I say, Charlie?\\
364 - I'm-I'm-I'm crazy about her.\\
365 - All right, I-I certainly don't want\\
366 - to stand in the way of your happiness.\\
367 - Well, thank you.\\
368 - One question, though.\\
369 - Yeah?\\
370 - What are you going to tell Jake\\
371 - when he notices his change jug is gone?\\
372 - Oh, uh, it'll be okay.\\
373 - I left him a postdated check.\\
374 - It'll be good by the time he goes to college.\\
375 - Yeah, like that kid's going to college.\\
376 - * Men.\\
377 - Perfect. Just perfect.\\
378 - Judith, I know what you're thinking...\\
379 - I'll tell you what I'm thinking.\\
380 - Your brother's a weaselly little coward\\
381 - who doesn't have the guts to face to his responsibilities...\\
382 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\\
383 - There's a little more to this than meets the eye.\\
384 - Oh, really? And I suppose you're going to explain it to me?\\
385 - I'm going to try, if you'll calm down\\
386 - for a minute and listen.\\
387 - All right, I'm listening.\\
388 - Are you calm?\\
389 - I'm listening.\\
390 - Okay. You know why Alan's not here?\\
391 - Because he's ashamed.\\
392 - Well, he should be.\\
393 - Judith, that's not listening.\\
394 - He's ashamed because no matter how hard he works,\\
395 - he just can't seem to get ahead.\\
396 - You know his business is falling apart, don't you?\\
397 - Really? He hasn't said anything.\\
398 - Because he's too proud.\\
399 - Poor guy lost all his chiropractic walk-ins\\
400 - to an unlicensed massage parlor\\
401 - that opened up right between him\\
402 - and the Jamba Juice.\\
403 - You're kidding.\\
404 - I'm deadly serious.\\
405 - Who's going to pay to have their spine adjusted\\
406 - when, for half the price,\\
407 - they can get their dingus dusted?\\
408 - Well, I wouldn't know about that.\\
409 - As it turns out, I'm a bit of an expert...\\
410 - and I'm telling you, he's going under.\\
411 - Oh, my God.\\
412 - Did you know he took a part-time job?\\
413 - No. But you didn't hear it from me.\\
414 - And please, please, don't say anything to Jake.\\
415 - The last thing Alan wants is to look like a failure\\
416 - in the eyes of that little boy in there.\\
417 - Of course not.\\
418 - I won't say a word.\\
419 - Thank you.\\
420 - Hey. Where's Dad?\\
421 - Just go with Uncle Charlie.\\
422 - Okay.\\
423 - Why is Mom crying?\\
424 - Because I'm good.\\
425 - I'm very, very good.\\
426 - * Men.\\
427 - I'm really getting tired of pizza.\\
428 - Well...\\
429 - I'm off to work.\\
430 - Get used to it.\\
431 - ( in bad Italian accent ): Enjoy-a your pizza.\\
432 - Scusi, signora.\\
433 - Um, Alan, what are you doing?\\
434 - Oh, Judith, I swear to God,\\
435 - I-I will get you your alimony as soon as possible...\\
436 - No, please, don't worry about it.\\
437 - Really?\\
438 - Charlie told me what's going on.\\
439 - I don't need the money right now.\\
440 - Really?\\
441 - I may not have mentioned it, but when my grandmother passed away,\\
442 - she left me a pretty substantial inheritance.\\
443 - Really?\\
444 - In fact, I want you to have this.\\
445 - Really?\\
446 - Pay me when you can.\\
447 - The important thing is you get back on your feet.\\
448 - ( in bad Italian accent ): I'm-a so happy.\\
449 - Hi, Huggy Bear.\\
450 - Boy, I love the new car you got me.\\
451 - Hi, Mrs. Harper.\\
452 - Doesn't he look cute in a mustache?\\
453 - ( in bad Italian accent ): I'm-a so sad.\\
454 - * Men.\\
455 - ( door opens and shuts )\\
456 - ( sighs )\\
457 - How's that pride doing?\\
458 - It's nice they let you take a few home.\\
459 - It's in lieu of health insurance.\\
460 - Did you know they actually have a little machine\\
461 - that shoots the cheese into the crust?\\
462 - Is that so?\\
463 - Yep. It's a little high-pressure gun.\\
464 - Can't kill yourself with it, though.\\
465 - I tried.\\
466 - I got to tell you something, Alan,\\
467 - and this is from the bottom of my heart.\\
468 - I think that you are the stupidest man\\
469 - on the face of the Earth,\\
470 - but I admire your perseverance.\\
471 - You're going to have to talk into the other ear.\\
472 - This one's full of cheese.\\
473 - ( sighs )\\
474 - KANDI: Is that my Huggy Bear?\\
475 - Yeah, it's him.\\
476 - KANDI: Hey, guess what?\\
477 - You know my roommates, Ellie and Emmett?\\
478 - Yeah.\\
479 - Turns out they're not really brother and sister,\\
480 - so they started sleeping together.\\
481 - Oh, that's lovely.\\
482 - Anyway, now they're going to get their own place,\\
483 - and I don't know how I'm going to pay\\
484 - the rent by myself.\\
485 - Huh.\\
486 - Oh, God, Kandi, I can't, I can't.\\
487 - I-I-I'm all tapped out.\\
488 - All I have left to put on eBay is a-a kidney or a lung.\\
489 - If I were you, I'd sell the kidney,\\
490 - 'cause lungs don't grow back.\\
491 - I'm sorry, honey.\\
492 - You're just going to have\\
493 - to handle your living situation on your own.\\
494 - Okay. Hey, guess what else?\\
495 - You've got a loved one who needs either an operation or bail?\\
496 - No, silly. I'm finished with the dentist,\\
497 - and my mouth is all better. See?\\
498 - Hey, I've got an idea.\\
499 - Why don't you move in with me?\\
500 - Okay!\\
501 - ( in bad Italian accent ): I'm-a so screwed.
\subsection {Episode 19: Golly Moses, She's a Muffin}
1 - You're up early.\\
2 - Well, it's a beautiful day, shame to waste it sleeping.\\
3 - Must have got to bed early then.\\
4 - I guess.\\
5 - Well, you know what they say.\\
6 - Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man, healthy, wealthy\\
7 - and can't get laid, huh?\\
8 - Maybe I'm not trying.\\
9 - Yeah. And look for me next month on the cover of Maxim.\\
10 - I'll have nothing on but the vacuum.\\
11 - Hey, you're up early.\\
12 - Yes, Alan, I'm up early.\\
13 - I went to bed early and I slept alone.\\
14 - Anything else you want to know?\\
15 - Was I this cranky when I wasn't having sex?\\
16 - Nah, you were more of a sullen whiner.\\
17 - Okay, Huggy Bear, I gotta go.\\
18 - All right, Kandi. Have a good day.\\
19 - Yo, Daisy Mae.\\
20 - Just out of curiosity,\\
21 - when you leave here, where is it you go?\\
22 - To the gym.\\
23 - I have to take care of my body 'cause it's my instrument.\\
24 - Mine, too.\\
25 - Three beers and a bratwurst\\
26 - and my ass turns into a French horn.\\
27 - Really?\\
28 - Whenever I have beer and bratwurst, I just fart a lot.\\
29 - Okay, okay, Kandi, well, I'll see you tonight.\\
30 - Bye, everybody.\\
31 - Congratulations, Alan.\\
32 - It looks like you've officially boinked her brains out.\\
33 - Okay, so she's not overly sophisticated.\\
34 - Sophisticated?\\
35 - She's two marbles rolling around in a tin can.\\
36 - Hey, she's got a great heart,\\
37 - she's warm and loving and she genuinely cares for me.\\
38 - I stand corrected.\\
39 - One marble.\\
40 - Look, buddy, I'm happy you finally found\\
41 - an instrument to play that isn't in your own pants...\\
42 - but she's been spending a lot of time here\\
43 - and if you're not careful,\\
44 - pretty soon she's gonna want to move in.\\
45 - Would that be so bad?\\
46 - Hey, I don't have a lot of rules around here,\\
47 - but nine of the top ten are just different ways\\
48 - of saying "women are not allowed to live here."\\
49 - They come and they go.\\
50 - Often they do one of those things multiple times,\\
51 - but in the end, they always go.\\
52 - But why is that so important?\\
53 - Alan, there's a natural balance in this house\\
54 - which must not be upset.\\
55 - It's like the Amazon rain forest.\\
56 - Bring in one too many spider monkeys and before you know it\\
57 - you're up to your ass in tree frogs.\\
58 - Oh, tree frogs. That clears everything up.\\
59 - Don't patronize me, you hump-happy simpleton.\\
60 - You know what I'm saying?\\
61 - I do-- you're saying that if Kandi were to move in here\\
62 - it would be an environmental disaster of epic proportions.\\
63 - Exactly.\\
64 - So I guess now would be a bad time to tell you\\
65 - that she's been living here the past three weeks.\\
66 - What?\\
67 - Who's the simpleton now?\\
68 - Kandi got evicted from her apartment three weeks ago\\
69 - and she moved in here.\\
70 - Oh, please, if a woman was living in my own house\\
71 - for that long I think I'd notice.\\
72 - Oh, really? Really?\\
73 - Well, uh, let's try a little experiment.\\
74 - What color is the couch in the living room?\\
75 - The couch?\\
76 - Ah-ah. No peeking.\\
77 - What color is it?\\
78 - Well, it's, uh, kind of a...\\
79 - beige-ish...\\
80 - Tan.\\
81 - You sure?\\
82 - Yeah, I'm sure.\\
83 - Go look.\\
84 - Fine.\\
85 - What the hell is that?\\
86 - Your couch.\\
87 - Jake spilled grape juice on it last summer\\
88 - and I had it re-upholstered.\\
89 - Last summer?\\
90 - Yeah, it was gone almost a month.\\
91 - Berta and I had a bet\\
92 - on how long it would take you to notice.\\
93 - I had 50 bucks on never.\\
94 - All right, this is unacceptable.\\
95 - This is my house and if furniture's\\
96 - gonna get re-upholstered or moved\\
97 - or changed in any way whatsoever,\\
98 - I demand to be consulted.\\
99 - Okay, from now on. I promise.\\
100 - Thank you.\\
101 - I bought the damn thing.\\
102 - You'd think I'd have a vote.\\
103 - Maybe show me a swatch.\\
104 - Hey, wait a minute!\\
105 - Did somebody say Kandi's living here?\\
106 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
107 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
108 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
109 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
110 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
111 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
112 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
113 - Boy, am I thirsty.\\
114 - That's 'cause you sweat so much during sex.\\
115 - Hey, I may not have the biggest boat in the marina,\\
116 - but nobody rows harder than me.\\
117 - You have a boat?\\
118 - No, sweetie, what I meant was...\\
119 - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\\
120 - Some of us don't want to hear about your little dinghy.\\
121 - Oh, hi, Charlie.\\
122 - What're you doing here?\\
123 - You know, I was asking myself the same thing,\\
124 - so I did a little research and it turns out, it's my house.\\
125 - Yeah, but I thought you were going out.\\
126 - I did go out. And then I came back.\\
127 - Alone?\\
128 - No, Alan, I brought home an invisible cocktail waitress.\\
129 - She's doing me even as we speak.\\
130 - You're right.\\
131 - There's no way you could've been that cranky.\\
132 - You want some company, Charlie?\\
133 - Alan can't have sex again for at least 30 minutes.\\
134 - That's a rough estimate.\\
135 - Thanks, but I'd really rather be alone.\\
136 - Okeydoke.\\
137 - Come on, I think he wants to masturbate.\\
138 - Not for at least 30 minutes.\\
139 - * Men *\\
140 - Okay, I haven't sampled anything\\
141 - from the other side of the buffet\\
142 - since I traveled with the Grateful Dead,\\
143 - but golly Moses, she's a muffin.\\
144 - Interesting turn of events, huh?\\
145 - Your brother hitting one\\
146 - of your hand-me-downs,\\
147 - and the way things are going, you couldn't get laid\\
148 - if you painted your penis to look like money.\\
149 - Don't think I haven't tried.\\
150 - I'm reminded of the tale of the tortoise and the hare.\\
151 - Isn't there something you could be doing?\\
152 - Well, I could rub some oil on her, but I don't trust myself.\\
153 - Berta, please don't take this the wrong way,\\
154 - but it's been a long time for me,\\
155 - and you're starting to turn me on.\\
156 - I'm out of here.\\
157 - KANDI: Hi, Berta.\\
158 - BERTA: Hey, baby.\\
159 - Hi, Charlie.\\
160 - Hi.\\
161 - Boy, this is weird, huh?\\
162 - In so many ways.\\
163 - But which one caught your attention?\\
164 - Well, I've never slept with brothers before.\\
165 - I mean, at different times.\\
166 - And one can't help but make comparisons.\\
167 - No kidding?\\
168 - So how big a difference are we talking about?\\
169 - It's huge.\\
170 - Really?\\
171 - Oh, yeah.\\
172 - With you, sex was kind of like going on Space Mountain.\\
173 - It's a good ride, but there's never any real danger.\\
174 - With Alan, it's like being in the back seat of a car\\
175 - driven by a really smart kangaroo.\\
176 - He may go up on the curb a couple of times,\\
177 - but he'll get you there.\\
178 - Okay, thanks for clearing that up.\\
179 - ( doorbell chimes ) I'll get it.\\
180 - There's a two-hour wait for Space Mountain.\\
181 - Hi, Mrs. Harper.\\
182 - Oh, dear Lord.\\
183 - Hey, Kandi, I got Evil Dead 3 for Xbox.\\
184 - Sweet!\\
185 - Kandi, maybe you'd like to go put some clothes on.\\
186 - Why?\\
187 - Yeah, she ain't hurting anybody.\\
188 - I just don't think that outfit is appropriate for Jake.\\
189 - Oh, I agree.\\
190 - He would look ridiculous in this.\\
191 - Can you get Alan for me?\\
192 - He's not back from work yet.\\
193 - He's not? Then what are you doing here?\\
194 - I live here now. Didn't Alan tell you?\\
195 - No, he did not.\\
196 - Charlie, I want to talk to you.\\
197 - Good to know.\\
198 - Charlie, get over here!\\
199 - ( groans )\\
200 - It was nice seeing you, Mrs. Harper.\\
201 - What in God's name does she see in him?\\
202 - Well, I don't have all the details, Mrs. Harper,\\
203 - but apparently when he's not being emasculated\\
204 - and demoralized on a daily basis,\\
205 - he's quite the lover.\\
206 - What's that supposed to mean?\\
207 - You know what they say.\\
208 - Your average man's like a good field mule.\\
209 - If you don't beat him, he'll keep plowing all day long.\\
210 - Nobody says that.\\
211 - You're hard to fool.\\
212 - Look, I don't mean to be rude,\\
213 - but I'm tired of talking to you.\\
214 - * Men *\\
215 - I had an interesting chat with your ex-wife today.\\
216 - Oh, can't we just have a nice dinner?\\
217 - I like her.\\
218 - ( contemptuously ): Why?\\
219 - ( pleasantly ): Uh... why?\\
220 - Well, unlike most ex-wives I've known,\\
221 - she's never tried to run me over with her car.\\
222 - Okay, new dinner conversation.\\
223 - Jake, how was school?\\
224 - I don't think this conversation will make you any happier, Dad.\\
225 - What now?\\
226 - We had a surprise test today.\\
227 - And?\\
228 - I was really surprised.\\
229 - So, in other words, you weren't prepared.\\
230 - You can't prepare for a surprise, Dad.\\
231 - New conversation?\\
232 - Jake, what are we gonna do?\\
233 - You've really fallen behind this year.\\
234 - I know. I think it's a delayed reaction to your divorce.\\
235 - Oh?\\
236 - Yeah, it took a while, but my teachers\\
237 - have finally stopped feeling sorry for me.\\
238 - You know, I'm a child of divorce, too, Jake.\\
239 - Really?\\
240 - How old were you when your parents split up?\\
241 - Twenty-two.\\
242 - But you're 22 now.\\
243 - 22 and a half.\\
244 - Boy, what I'd give to be 22 again.\\
245 - New subject?\\
246 - No. No more conversation.\\
247 - Jake, if you're finished, just go do your homework.\\
248 - I'm gonna need help.\\
249 - You don't need help, you need to focus.\\
250 - I'll help you, Jake.\\
251 - Do you know anything about geometry?\\
252 - Well, I know it's what you say when you turn into a tree.\\
253 - Get it?\\
254 - Gee, I'm a tree.\\
255 - Good one.\\
256 - Boy, I hope when they get to Oz\\
257 - the wizard has two brains to give out.\\
258 - And speaking of out, when's Kandi leaving?\\
259 - You don't have to worry.\\
260 - Because?\\
261 - I have a plan.\\
262 - Alan, if history has taught us anything,\\
263 - it's that both those statements cannot be true.\\
264 - It's very simple.\\
265 - You give a man a fish, he eats for a day.\\
266 - You teach him to fish, he eats forever.\\
267 - Okay, okay, in that example is Kandi the man or the fish?\\
268 - I found her a job.\\
269 - Within a few weeks she'll be able to afford her own place\\
270 - and she won't have to depend on me anymore.\\
271 - Where is she working?\\
272 - Uh, she's going to be our receptionist.\\
273 - That's your plan?\\
274 - Why, it's... it's... brilliant!\\
275 - What? She's attractive,\\
276 - she's friendly, she's more than capable\\
277 - of answering the phones.\\
278 - Alan, you ever hear the expression\\
279 - "don't crap where you eat"?\\
280 - Well, you, my friend, are dropping plunkies\\
281 - all over the dessert cart.\\
282 - Okay, you have a better solution?\\
283 - No, no, no, no.\\
284 - It's your girlfriend, your office, your life.\\
285 - Screw it up however you think best.\\
286 - ( phone ringing )\\
287 - I'll get it. I'm expecting a call.\\
288 - Hello.\\
289 - ( phone ringing )\\
290 - Kandi, that's... that's the TV remote.\\
291 - Oh, duh.\\
292 - Hello.\\
293 - ( phone ringing )\\
294 - Hello?\\
295 - Have you thought of teaching a fish to answer the phones?\\
296 - Hello?\\
297 - Staying in tonight?\\
298 - Yep.\\
299 - Giving up on the ladies, huh? Yep.\\
300 - Not even going to try? Nope.\\
301 - You know, I got a niece in the joint.\\
302 - She doesn't look like much,\\
303 - but she does get conjugal visits.\\
304 - I don't think so.\\
305 - Hold on, I may have a copy of her mug shot.\\
306 - Here.\\
307 - She looks a little wall-eyed,\\
308 - but that's only because they had to use the taser\\
309 - to get her out of the shed.\\
310 - The shed?\\
311 - She was running a meth lab.\\
312 - But you've got to admit, she's nice and slender.\\
313 - Thanks, but pass.\\
314 - Think about it.\\
315 - Visiting days are Wednesdays and Fridays.\\
316 - But if you decide to go, be a sport-- take her a pie.\\
317 - Right.\\
318 - Make is something chewy.\\
319 - The prison dentist set her up with some real nice teeth.\\
320 - * Men *\\
321 - Okay, now this isn't my lamp.\\
322 - What happened to my lamp?\\
323 - Unless this is my lamp.\\
324 - Yeah, this is my lamp.\\
325 - I bought this lamp to go with my couch.\\
326 - My tan couch.\\
327 - Worst day of my life.\\
328 - Yeah, well, it was no picnic for me either.\\
329 - I don't even know who you are anymore.\\
330 - Oh, you want to know who I am?\\
331 - I'm the idiot who's paying you ten dollars an hour\\
332 - to miss phone calls, nap in the bathroom\\
333 - and use my X-ray machine on Mexican food.\\
334 - Well, I wanted to know what's inside a chimichanga.\\
335 - If you didn't know what's in it, why'd you order it?\\
336 - 'Cause it's fun to say chimichanga.\\
337 - Chimichanga!\\
338 - See?\\
339 - How was work?\\
340 - Horrible.\\
341 - All he did was boss me around.\\
342 - "Do this, do that, wake up."\\
343 - Maybe that's because I'm your boss.\\
344 - A stupid, stinky boss.\\
345 - Does anybody want to know about my problems?\\
346 - It was supposed to be Sloppy Joes for lunch,\\
347 - but instead they had fish sticks.\\
348 - Well, it ruined my day.\\
349 - ( phone ringing )\\
350 - No, no, no, I'll get it. That's what I do.\\
351 - That's all I'm good for.\\
352 - Hello.\\
353 - Oh, fudge.\\
354 - Picture an entire day of this...\\
355 - with six lines.\\
356 - Hello.\\
357 - Oh, hi, Mrs. Harper.\\
358 - Oh, great.\\
359 - Kandi, Kandi, give me the phone.\\
360 - Back off, bucko.\\
361 - Was your ex-husband always such a control freak?\\
362 - She says you were.\\
363 - You know what he did today?\\
364 - Kandi, Kandi, you don't have to get into that with her, okay?\\
365 - She says she wants to know.\\
366 - Well, first of all at the office\\
367 - he tried to make me call him "Dr. Harper" all day,\\
368 - and when I forgot he yelled at me.\\
369 - What?\\
370 - Chiropractors aren't really doctors?\\
371 - You liar.\\
372 - I so get why you dumped him.\\
373 - Hey, Alan? What?\\
374 - Is this a new lamp?\\
375 - Okay, I will call you Judith.\\
376 - Great, I'll see you there.\\
377 - See her... her where?\\
378 - We are going out for a drink and a little girl talk.\\
379 - Girl talk with my ex-wife?\\
380 - Her name is Judith. Mr. I'm-not-a-doctor Harper.\\
381 - Don't wait up.\\
382 - Wow. You just crapped where you used to eat.\\
383 - * Men *\\
384 - Hey.\\
385 - Hey.\\
386 - What are you doing up so late?\\
387 - What time is it?\\
388 - It's 3:00 a.m.\\
389 - Oh, well, I got my eight hours.\\
390 - What are you doing, waiting up for Kandi?\\
391 - Oh, no, no, no.\\
392 - I, uh, I couldn't sleep,\\
393 - so I thought I'd read a little.\\
394 - A furniture catalog?\\
395 - I like furniture.\\
396 - Just looking at the pictures, huh?\\
397 - What are you getting at, Charlie?\\
398 - I think you buy things.\\
399 - I think...\\
400 - you bought this lamp.\\
401 - That's the same lamp that was here when I moved in.\\
402 - Oh, really?\\
403 - Charlie, I'm afraid that this dry streak\\
404 - is starting to affect your mind.\\
405 - Maybe you're right.\\
406 - Sure, this is my lamp.\\
407 - I've had it for years.\\
408 - The table it's on is new.\\
409 - I knew it!\\
410 - ( door opening ) KANDI: Shh.\\
411 - We don't want to wake up Mr. Alan Hitler.\\
412 - No, no, Osama Bin Alan.\\
413 - ( laughing )\\
414 - ( slurring words ): Oops. Busted.\\
415 - What the hell is going on here?\\
416 - ( slurring words ): The hell that is going on here\\
417 - is that I need an advance on my amilony.\\
418 - Why?\\
419 - To pay Estafan our limo driver.\\
420 - You took a limo?\\
421 - We couldn't find our cars,\\
422 - and we spent all our money\\
423 - on Jell-O shots and chimichangas.\\
424 - All right, all right.\\
425 - Kandi, you need to go to bed.\\
426 - We have to get up early for work.\\
427 - No, we don't, 'cause I quit.\\
428 - Why don't we talk about this in the morning.\\
429 - All right, Judith,\\
430 - Here is your... "amilony."\\
431 - Thank you.\\
432 - Go home.\\
433 - And, Kandi, go to bed.\\
434 - Nuh-uh. I do not wish to live with you any furthermore.\\
435 - What?\\
436 - I have been invited\\
437 - to stay with my good friend Judith.\\
438 - ( chuckles )\\
439 - Come on, I'll help you pack your things.\\
440 - Did you ever notice how much he sweats during sex?\\
441 - Well, good for you.\\
442 - Good for me?\\
443 - How is this good for me?\\
444 - You finally got Kandi out of the house.\\
445 - I didn't want her out of the house,\\
446 - and I certainly didn't want her moving in with my ex-wife.\\
447 - Oh, right.\\
448 - All right, then... good for me.\\
449 - * Men *\\
450 - WOMAN: Harper.\\
451 - Here.\\
452 - I'm going to have to check your pie.\\
453 - Rhubarb.\\
454 - Oh, all of my girls like rhubarb.\\
455 - Okay, inmate 37059.\\
456 - Down the hall, third door on the left.\\
457 - There's a button by the bed.\\
458 - Push it if she gets violent.\\
459 - Thank you.\\
460 - ( bell rings )\\
461 - It won't open.\\
462 - Try it again.\\
463 - ( bell rings )\\
464 - Boy, you're really having a dry streak, aren't you?\\
465 - ( doorbell ringing ) ( gasps )\\
466 - I can't even get laid in a women's prison.\\
467 - ( doorbell ringing )\\
468 - Hi.\\
469 - Are you Alan?\\
470 - No, I'm his brother, Charlie.\\
471 - Oh, well, I'm looking for Kandi.\\
472 - She told me she was living here.\\
473 - Actually, she moved.\\
474 - It's a very funny story.\\
475 - Are you a friend?\\
476 - I'm her mother.\\
477 - Oh. Well, come on in.\\
478 - I'll see if I can find a forwarding address.\\
479 - Thank you.\\
480 - Chimichanga.\\
481 - It's a beautiful place.\\
482 - Thank you.\\
483 - I see where Kandi gets her good looks.\\
484 - Thanks.\\
485 - Unfortunately, she gets her brains from her moron father.\\
486 - Oh, that's right. You're recently divorced.\\
487 - Would you like a drink?\\
488 - I would love one.\\
489 - Great.\\
490 - Why don't you step out on the deck\\
491 - and I'll be right there.\\
492 - Good news, it's raining out on my deck.\\
493 - Say what?\\
494 - The dry streak is over.\\
495 - So what am I supposed to do with this pie?\\
496 - * Men *
\subsection {Episode 20: Always a Bridesmaid, Never a Burro}
1 - Hey, what are you doing home in the middle of the afternoon?\\
2 - Look outside.\\
3 - Huh.\\
4 - I guess the day got away from me.\\
5 - So, you still depressed?\\
6 - What do you think?\\
7 - Well, by the looks of things, I'd say you're one sad song away\\
8 - from deep-throating a shotgun.\\
9 - Be a pal and put down a tarp first.\\
10 - How did my life get to this point, Charlie?\\
11 - How does a man sink this low?\\
12 - Well, in all fairness, you had a running start.\\
13 - Sorry, sorry.\\
14 - Go on.\\
15 - Things were going so well.\\
16 - I had a young, hot girlfriend\\
17 - who fulfilled all my sexual desires.\\
18 - How many desires are we talking about?\\
19 - Just the one, you know.\\
20 - For sex.\\
21 - But now she's gone.\\
22 - Aw, buddy.\\
23 - She's not really gone.\\
24 - You know where she is.\\
25 - Yeah.\\
26 - And where is that, Alan?\\
27 - Why are you doing this?\\
28 - Say it, Alan.\\
29 - The healing begins when you can say it out loud.\\
30 - My girlfriend is living with my ex-wife.\\
31 - You know, I was wrong.\\
32 - It's not the healing\\
33 - that begins when you say it out loud,\\
34 - it's the laughter.\\
35 - Nice talking to you.\\
36 - Wait, wait, wait, hold on.\\
37 - Don't you want to hear how I can help you with all this?\\
38 - I am not going back to Tijuana for another\\
39 - X-rated live performance of The Bride and the Burro.\\
40 - Okay, okay, first of all,\\
41 - that's not what I was gonna suggest.\\
42 - But if you recall, that trip got you through\\
43 - a particularly dark, depressing part of your divorce.\\
44 - The first time you smiled in months\\
45 - was when you caught the bouquet.\\
46 - All right, all right.\\
47 - Against my better judgment, I'm gonna go ahead and ask.\\
48 - How do you propose to help me?\\
49 - Well, first, let's make sure that we agree on the problem.\\
50 - Your ex-wife has befriended your girlfriend. Yes.\\
51 - And your girlfriend has moved in with your ex-wife.\\
52 - Yes.\\
53 - And now your ex-wife is turning your girlfriend against you.\\
54 - How many times do we have to go through this?\\
55 - Just until it stops being funny.\\
56 - Anyway, anyway, it would seem to me the simple solution\\
57 - is to find someone to speak to Kandi on your behalf,\\
58 - someone she trusts.\\
59 - Yes, that would be great.\\
60 - Now what's your point?\\
61 - WOMAN: Charlie?\\
62 - If you're not coming back to bed,\\
63 - at least tell me where you keep the fresh batteries.\\
64 - I'll be right up.\\
65 - And it's rechargeable.\\
66 - My point is,\\
67 - I'm banging Kandi's mom.\\
68 - Wh-what?\\
69 - You're welcome.\\
70 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
71 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
72 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
73 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh... *\\
74 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
75 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
76 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
77 - CHARLIE ( singsong ): Who is it?\\
78 - You know damn well who it is.\\
79 - ( singsong ): I'm entertaining.\\
80 - ( singsong ): Not as much as you seem to think.\\
81 - Hang on.\\
82 - Not you. You let go.\\
83 - Come on in, Alan.\\
84 - Are you decent?\\
85 - WOMAN: He's above average.\\
86 - CHARLIE: Just come in.\\
87 - Come on.\\
88 - Oh, he's cute.\\
89 - I can see why Kandi likes him.\\
90 - Used to like him.\\
91 - Oh, yeah, I'm so sorry about that.\\
92 - Come, sit.\\
93 - Let's talk about it.\\
94 - Are you sure I'm not interrupting?\\
95 - Don't worry about it.\\
96 - We're kind of at the seventh inning stretch anyway.\\
97 - Wow, you can go two more innings?\\
98 - Even if I have to start throwing knuckleballs.\\
99 - Sit down.\\
100 - Okay.\\
101 - So, uh, you're Kandi's mom, huh?\\
102 - Mandi.\\
103 - Alan.\\
104 - Some grip, huh?\\
105 - Well, Mandi, I can see\\
106 - where your daughter gets her good looks from.\\
107 - Thank you.\\
108 - You know, a lot of people think we're sisters.\\
109 - Ooh, there's a mental picture\\
110 - that'll get me through the last two innings.\\
111 - Don't be naughty.\\
112 - Why, are you gonna spank me?\\
113 - I just might.\\
114 - I just might let you.\\
115 - I just might go hang myself.\\
116 - Oh, relax.\\
117 - Kandi said he was a little shy.\\
118 - You know, the first time they had sex,\\
119 - he didn't even take his shirt off.\\
120 - Excuse me, that wasn't shyness.\\
121 - The first time I had sex with your daughter,\\
122 - I barely got my pants off.\\
123 - Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
124 - Boundaries.\\
125 - This is Kandi's mom.\\
126 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
127 - I didn't mean to create an awkward moment.\\
128 - But enough about me.\\
129 - How is it that you two are...\\
130 - I mean, you know, uh, uh,\\
131 - how did you exactly...\\
132 - What the hell is going on here?\\
133 - Good question, and a great story.\\
134 - Mandi showed up here looking for Kandi.\\
135 - That's not a great story.\\
136 - Sure it is.\\
137 - It's already had like half a dozen happy endings.\\
138 - You are definitely going over my knee.\\
139 - Alan, we got to wrap it up here.\\
140 - But you said you'd help me with Kandi.\\
141 - I didn't say now.\\
142 - Do you want me to talk to her, Alan?\\
143 - I would really appreciate it.\\
144 - Excuse me, but the pitcher's all warmed up\\
145 - and ready to take the mound.\\
146 - Of course, I'm kind of busy at the moment.\\
147 - Got it.\\
148 - ( Mandi and Charlie humming"Charge" )\\
149 - MANDI: Charge!\\
150 - * Men... *\\
151 - Hey, Dad. Hey, buddy...\\
152 - Mom, Dad's here!\\
153 - Shh, shh, shh.\\
154 - No, don't bother your mom.\\
155 - Is Kandi around?\\
156 - Yeah, she lives here now.\\
157 - Yeah, I know.\\
158 - Does this mean she and Mom are gay?\\
159 - No, it does not.\\
160 - Too bad.\\
161 - Why?\\
162 - It'd be a lot easier to explain.\\
163 - Could you just tell Kandi I'm here?\\
164 - Okay.\\
165 - Kandi, my dad's here!\\
166 - Shh, shh.\\
167 - What do you want, Alan?\\
168 - I want to talk to Kandi.\\
169 - I don't think that's a good idea. Why not?\\
170 - Because she's a sweet, innocent girl,\\
171 - and I don't want you to ruin her life, too.\\
172 - Too?\\
173 - How did I ruin your life?\\
174 - You stole my youth.\\
175 - You took my house!\\
176 - That seems like a fair trade.\\
177 - Face it, Alan.\\
178 - This whole escapade with Kandi is just a pathetic attempt\\
179 - to find a younger version of me.\\
180 - Are you kidding?\\
181 - Judith, I had a younger version of you,\\
182 - and let me tell you, it was no great shakes.\\
183 - It's okay, Judith.\\
184 - I'll talk to him.\\
185 - Oh, sweetie, he doesn't really want to talk to you.\\
186 - There's only one thing a man like this is interested in.\\
187 - What?\\
188 - Forget it.\\
189 - I'm here if you need me.\\
190 - ( clears throat )\\
191 - Listen, Kandi, I'm really sorry about our fight.\\
192 - I know I can be a bit of a control freak,\\
193 - but I honestly care for you,\\
194 - and I hope you'll give me another chance.\\
195 - I see.\\
196 - Excuse me.\\
197 - I can't let you steal my youth.\\
198 - You're not fooling anybody, Judith.\\
199 - Come on, Kandi, tell me what you think.\\
200 - Okay.\\
201 - I think we've reached an implants in our relationship.\\
202 - JUDITH: Impasse!\\
203 - I think we've reached an impasse in our relationship.\\
204 - Good-bye.\\
205 - Excuse me, is this Judith Harper's house?\\
206 - Yeah. She traded it for her youth.\\
207 - ( doorbell rings )\\
208 - Hi, Daddy!\\
209 - Hi, sweetheart!\\
210 - Come on in.\\
211 - Judith can't wait to meet you.\\
212 - I can't wait to meet her.\\
213 - KANDI: I know you two are gonna love each other.\\
214 - ( door closes )\\
215 - I watch one donkey sex show,\\
216 - and you make me pay for it the rest of my life!\\
217 - * Men... *\\
218 - CHARLIE ( singsong ): Who is it?\\
219 - Don't screw with me, Charlie.\\
220 - We need to talk.\\
221 - Give me a sec.\\
222 - MANDI: Charlie, you're just making it tighter.\\
223 - CHARLIE: Come on in, Alan.\\
224 - Hey there.\\
225 - Hi ya.\\
226 - You know, I can come back.\\
227 - It's okay, Alan.\\
228 - Come, sit.\\
229 - All right.\\
230 - So, how'd it go with Kandi?\\
231 - If it had gone well, do you think I'd be sitting here\\
232 - talking to two half-naked people?\\
233 - Alan.\\
234 - What?\\
235 - I'm completely naked.\\
236 - What happened, Alan?\\
237 - Well, as I suspected,\\
238 - Judith has turned your daughter against me.\\
239 - Well, I'm not surprised.\\
240 - Kandi's always been very suggestible.\\
241 - You know, until she was eight,\\
242 - she thought this was her nose.\\
243 - Aw, that's kind of cute.\\
244 - When Alan was eight,\\
245 - I convinced him he only had two weeks to live.\\
246 - But I suppose that tells you more about me than him.\\
247 - Yeah, good times.\\
248 - But back to recent events...\\
249 - Ooh, ooh. Remember when I told you the cat litter box\\
250 - was filled with Almond Roca?\\
251 - He ate four of them. ( laughs )\\
252 - Are we done visiting\\
253 - Charlie Harper's Museum of Sibling Cruelty?\\
254 - Because I actually have something to talk about.\\
255 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
256 - I didn't realize I was interrupting you.\\
257 - Go ahead, Alan.\\
258 - Thank you.\\
259 - So as I was leaving my ex-wife's house,\\
260 - I ran into your ex-husband.\\
261 - Andy?\\
262 - I guess. CHARLIE: Wait a second.\\
263 - It's Mandi, Andy and Kandi?\\
264 - What's your point?\\
265 - No point.\\
266 - Mandi, Andy, Kandi.\\
267 - Dandy.\\
268 - Anyway, it appears as if Kandi\\
269 - has set my ex-wife up on a blind date with him.\\
270 - How nice.\\
271 - Nice? How is that nice?\\
272 - Well, he's been kind of depressed since we broke up.\\
273 - It's good to see he's getting back on the horse.\\
274 - But that horse is my ex-wife!\\
275 - Speaking of which,\\
276 - did you ever see The Bride and the Burro in Tijuana?\\
277 - See it?\\
278 - I caught the bouquet.\\
279 - ( chuckles ) So did Alan.\\
280 - Oh.\\
281 - ( sighs ) Always a bridesmaid, never a burro.\\
282 - Charlie, I'm starting to lose feeling in my arm.\\
283 - Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.\\
284 - Hey, you went pretty far in the Scouts.\\
285 - Can you undo this knot?\\
286 - Gee, actually, I specialized in Indian lore--\\
287 - beaded belts, arrowheads,\\
288 - but good luck, though.\\
289 - Maybe you should go get a pair of scissors.\\
290 - Hang on, let me untie my feet.\\
291 - ( clears throat )\\
292 - We really didn't think this through, did we?\\
293 - * Men... *\\
294 - So, has your mom been seeing a lot of Kandi's dad?\\
295 - That-that's right.\\
296 - If she married him, Kandi would be your stepsister.\\
297 - Hey, hey, do you happen to know if they're going out tonight?\\
298 - Yep, if I married Kandi, she would be your stepmother.\\
299 - But, but tonight, is your mom going out tonight?\\
300 - Yeah, yeah, I get it.\\
301 - If Kandi took a poop, it'd be your step stool.\\
302 - All right, well... it's always good to talk to you.\\
303 - Love you, buddy.\\
304 - Did you get all that, Berta?\\
305 - I think so, but let's do a quick recap.\\
306 - Your girlfriend's living with your ex-wife,\\
307 - your ex-wife is dating your girlfriend's father,\\
308 - and to top it off, you're trying to get useful intelligence\\
309 - from a kid who's got precious little to spare.\\
310 - Okay, just checking.\\
311 - CHARLIE: Hey, Berta,\\
312 - I want you to meet Mandi.\\
313 - Mandi, Berta. Hi.\\
314 - Enchante.\\
315 - Listen, uh...\\
316 - we got a pair of scissors handy?\\
317 - Oh, Charlie, that's a silk tie.\\
318 - Why didn't you use one of the poly blends?\\
319 - Hey, hey, wait a minute.\\
320 - That's my tie.\\
321 - You ruined my tie.\\
322 - Oh, yeah.\\
323 - You're not gonna be happy\\
324 - about your electric toothbrush, either.\\
325 - Kandi's told me so many nice things about you.\\
326 - How do you know Kandi?\\
327 - She's my daughter.\\
328 - Your daughter?\\
329 - Sweet whistling Geronimo!\\
330 - You people are like a box of hamsters,\\
331 - just crawling all over each other.\\
332 - Yes, yes.\\
333 - We all get how this looks, Berta.\\
334 - Hey, I'm not knocking it.\\
335 - I'm just wondering when some of that gravy's\\
336 - gonna spill over on my 'taters.\\
337 - * Men... *\\
338 - ( doorbell rings )\\
339 - Hey, what's up?\\
340 - "What's up?"\\
341 - What are you doing here?\\
342 - Well, Mandi came over to put in a good word for you,\\
343 - and I figured I'd tag along for grins.\\
344 - Oh, here comes one now.\\
345 - Come on in.\\
346 - I'm in a nightmare,\\
347 - and I can't wake up.\\
348 - Sit down, make yourself at home.\\
349 - Thanks, I will.\\
350 - Where's Jake?\\
351 - He's at a sleepover.\\
352 - Hi, Alan.\\
353 - How are you?\\
354 - About two heartbeats from a brain aneurysm.\\
355 - Where's Kandi?\\
356 - She's in her room,\\
357 - but I thought we should talk first.\\
358 - We just have a few questions.\\
359 - About what?\\
360 - Charlie?\\
361 - Well, Kandi's mom and I\\
362 - are a little concerned about your intentions.\\
363 - You should be, 'cause I intend to kill you.\\
364 - ( sighs )\\
365 - Now, that's the kind of attitude that isn't gonna\\
366 - win you a lot of friends around here, mister.\\
367 - Alan, you're a very sweet man.\\
368 - But let's face facts.\\
369 - Kandi has her whole life ahead of her,\\
370 - while you... not so much.\\
371 - Kandi! Alan?\\
372 - I am so sorry.\\
373 - No, I'm sorry.\\
374 - Oh, isn't that sweet?\\
375 - I missed you so much.\\
376 - I missed you, too, Huggy Bear.\\
377 - Mom, I'm gonna go have sex with Alan, okay?\\
378 - You kids have fun.\\
379 - Hold on there, young man.\\
380 - What?\\
381 - Don't be a selfish lover.\\
382 - Consider her needs.\\
383 - This isn't over.\\
384 - You're right, he is easy to screw with.\\
385 - Hey, four pieces of Almond Roca.\\
386 - Even the cat was laughing at him.\\
387 - So, should we head back to my place?\\
388 - I suppose.\\
389 - What's wrong?\\
390 - Nothing, it's just... we already had sex there.\\
391 - Oh, baby, I really, really like you.\\
392 - Well, thank you, Judith.\\
393 - I had a wonderful evening, and I hope\\
394 - we can do it again some...\\
395 - ( both moaning )\\
396 - ...maybe catch a movie.\\
397 - ...or go for a hike. Uh-huh.\\
398 - I'm guessing that's your ex-husband.\\
399 - Uh-huh. Good-looking man.\\
400 - Oh, he's gorgeous.\\
401 - Dumb as wood.\\
402 - JUDITH: Oh, my Lord!\\
403 - But it's good wood.\\
404 - I'll go find Alan so we can get out of here.\\
405 - You want to leave?\\
406 - This is so hot.\\
407 - Oh, Mandi, you just keep getting better and better.\\
408 - Hang on while I give Alan a heads up.\\
409 - Hurry back.\\
410 - Alan?\\
411 - ( knocks )\\
412 - Alan?\\
413 - JUDITH: You are the most beautiful man I have ever seen.\\
414 - Not Alan.\\
415 - I couldn't find him...\\
416 - Mandi?\\
417 - Mandi?\\
418 - ANDY: You know what else I like?\\
419 - Swap meets. JUDITH: Swell.\\
420 - Your ex-husband must be a real little guy, huh?\\
421 - Forget about him.\\
422 - Let's get some wine in you. Okay.\\
423 - Mandi.\\
424 - Glasses are in there. Mm.\\
425 - No, no, top shelf.\\
426 - Okay.\\
427 - That's what I'm talking about.\\
428 - JUDITH: Come on.\\
429 - Do you ever go rock climbing?\\
430 - It's a great workout.\\
431 - Mandi?\\
432 - Mandi?\\
433 - Mandi?\\
434 - Alan?\\
435 - Anybody?\\
436 - Over here.\\
437 - Oh, damn it!\\
438 - What are you doing?\\
439 - I was thirsty.\\
440 - Have you seen Alan?\\
441 - I've been in the closet.\\
442 - So where the hell is he?\\
443 - I'm sorry I'm so nervous.\\
444 - I haven't been with another woman in a long time.\\
445 - Yeah, yeah. Take off your robe.\\
446 - Okay.\\
447 - JUDITH: Hot damn.\\
448 - Yeah, it is hot.\\
449 - Hi, Daddy!\\
450 - Hey, Judith.\\
451 - Daddy, I want you to meet my boyfriend Alan.\\
452 - Nice to see you again.\\
453 - Small world.\\
454 - * Men...\\
455 - JUDITH: Just get out!\\
456 - I'll give you a call, Judith.\\
457 - Maybe we'll hit some garage sales.\\
458 - Yeah, terrific.\\
459 - I like your daughter.\\
460 - I like your ex-wife.\\
461 - Want to get a drink?\\
462 - I'm not doing anything.\\
463 - Do you like garage sales?\\
464 - KANDI: Where am I supposed to go?\\
465 - JUDITH: I don't care, just leave.\\
466 - But I thought we were friends.\\
467 - Friends don't have sex with their friends' ex-husbands\\
468 - in the first friend's hot tub.\\
469 - Yeah-huh!\\
470 - Divorced three years, and he's still ruining my life.\\
471 - I should have drowned his stupid ass.\\
472 - Did you hear something?\\
473 - Nope.\\
474 - How's the head?\\
475 - Let's find out.
\subsection {Episode 21: And the Plot Moistens}
1 - Alan, do you ever fantasize when we're making love?\\
2 - Well, occasionally, I pretend that I'm better-looking.\\
3 - What about you?\\
4 - Sometimes I imagine we're in the middle\\
5 - of a big department store.\\
6 - Ha... having sex?\\
7 - No. Shopping.\\
8 - Why would I fantasize about having sex\\
9 - while I'm having sex?\\
10 - Do you think about ham and cheese\\
11 - when you're eating a sandwich?\\
12 - Can't argue with that.\\
13 - What ya thinkin'?\\
14 - Well, nothing, really. I... I just...\\
15 - I got a call from Jake's school today.\\
16 - Huh. You know who called me?\\
17 - Jessica Murray.\\
18 - Oh? Who's that?\\
19 - A friend of mine.\\
20 - Yeah. Well, anyway, Jake's mom and I\\
21 - have to go to a parent-teacher conference tomorrow,\\
22 - and I don't really know what it's about.\\
23 - Huh. Hey, do you ever pretend your toes are little people?\\
24 - What? No.\\
25 - Sometimes I make believe they're different families\\
26 - playing Family Feud.\\
27 - All right, let's meet our champions.\\
28 - He goes to market, she stays home.\\
29 - Please welcome the Piggie family!\\
30 - Hi, everybody!\\
31 - You're goin' down, Piggie Family.\\
32 - You're goin' down!\\
33 - Hey.\\
34 - Hey.\\
35 - How's it goin'?\\
36 - Forget it, Alan.\\
37 - I only do the apr  s sex chat\\
38 - with people I've just had sex with.\\
39 - Come on. She's playing Family Feud with her toes.\\
40 - I don't care if she's playing banjo with her nipples.\\
41 - But I need to communicate after lovemaking.\\
42 - I-I need to share.\\
43 - Well, maybe you should have thought of that\\
44 - before you started boinkin' a girl\\
45 - with the IQ of Tickle Me Elmo.\\
46 - Fine.\\
47 - Hey, Berta. How's it goin'?\\
48 - Back off, Zippy.\\
49 - If you want pillow talk,\\
50 - you gotta spoon me first.\\
51 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
52 - * Ah... * Men.\\
53 - but I think we all agree that ship has pretty much sailed.\\
54 - So why did you want to see us?\\
55 - Well, I'm concerned that, even outside of the classroom,\\
56 - Jake has no interest in anything that goes on around here.\\
57 - Now, hang on.\\
58 - He speaks very highly of your hot lunch program.\\
59 - Well, I was talking more about hobbies\\
60 - or extracurricular activities.\\
61 - Well, I don't know about his father,\\
62 - but I've tried to share some of my interests with him.\\
63 - Unfortunately, he's a little young\\
64 - to drink in the dark and bitch about men.\\
65 - ( snickering )\\
66 - You know...\\
67 - I was kind of lacking in focus\\
68 - when I was his age, too,\\
69 - until I got bit by the ol' theater bug.\\
70 - Too bad you didn't get bit by the ol' rabid squirrel.\\
71 - You know, I'm organizing a drama club.\\
72 - Would that be something that Jake would have any interest in,\\
73 - or do you think he gets enough drama at home?\\
74 - All the world's a stage.\\
75 - And we are merely players.\\
76 - ( laughing )\\
77 - Ooh. Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.\\
78 - Did she say what I was in trouble for?\\
79 - No.\\
80 - Boy, it's the not knowing that drives you crazy.\\
81 - Yeah, like a pregnancy test.\\
82 - Yep.\\
83 - I don't get it.\\
84 - ( coin jingling )\\
85 - Yes!\\
86 - In your face, Opie.\\
87 - This game stinks.\\
88 - No, you stink at it.\\
89 - That was my lunch money.\\
90 - Aw, your lunch money?\\
91 - Why didn't you tell me?\\
92 - * Boo freakin' hoo-- pack a sandwich. *\\
93 - Okay, Jake, we talked\\
94 - to Miss Sheffield...\\
95 - I'm sorry.\\
96 - What are you sorry about?\\
97 - I'm... I'm sorry I interrupted you.\\
98 - Go ahead.\\
99 - Well, we thought it would be a good idea\\
100 - if you got involved in some extracurricular activities.\\
101 - Oh. Okay.\\
102 - Great, great, we'll talk about it at home.\\
103 - Do you even know what an extracurricular activity is?\\
104 - Who cares? I'm off the hook.\\
105 - * Men...\\
106 - * I... am the very model of a modern major general *\\
107 - * I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral *\\
108 - * I know the kings of England, *\\
109 - * And I quote the fights historical *\\
110 - * From Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical. *\\
111 - What do you think?\\
112 - What was this all about?\\
113 - It's choreography. It's gay!\\
114 - Okay, you know, forget about the movements.\\
115 - Just try singing the song.\\
116 - No. Why not?\\
117 - Because it's gay.\\
118 - Don't encourage him.\\
119 - Don't make him sing Gilbert and Sullivan.\\
120 - He needs something to audition for the school musical.\\
121 - You teach him a song.\\
122 - Why don't you let him choose?\\
123 - Jake, why don't you tell your uncle\\
124 - what you wanted to sing.\\
125 - It's called "Whoop That Stanky Ho."\\
126 - All right, there's got to be some middle ground here.\\
127 - You like classic rock, right? Yeah.\\
128 - Okay, well, pick a band.\\
129 - Um... how about Queen?\\
130 - Oh, good, I was afraid\\
131 - he was gonna pick something gay.\\
132 - ( playing intro of "Bohemian Rhapsody" )\\
133 - * I see a little silhouetto of a man *\\
134 - * Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the fandango? *\\
135 - * Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me *\\
136 - ( falsetto, then tenor ): * Galileo, Galileo\\
137 - * Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Figaro magnifico... *\\
138 - ( stops playing )\\
139 - It doesn't sound right.\\
140 - You heard it, too, huh?\\
141 - You sure you're playing all the right notes?\\
142 - Yes, I'm sure.\\
143 - Well, it doesn't sound anything like Queen's version.\\
144 - No, it doesn't.\\
145 - Why don't you work on it?\\
146 - We'll try again tomorrow.\\
147 - Yeah, why don't I do that?\\
148 - Kid's a double threat...\\
149 - tone-deaf and arrogant.\\
150 - Hey.\\
151 - Where have you been?\\
152 - Kandi called looking for you.\\
153 - Oh, I had to work late.\\
154 - Oh.\\
155 - Yeah, one of my regular patients had, uh, a crisis.\\
156 - His name is Roger.\\
157 - He had a couple of vertebrae pinching a nerve.\\
158 - Too bad. Nice guy, you'd like him.\\
159 - He restores old cars.\\
160 - Well, it's actually more of a hobby than a job.\\
161 - He works at Staples.\\
162 - His name is Roger.\\
163 - Alan? Yeah?\\
164 - Why are you lying to me?\\
165 - I don't know.\\
166 - I really suck at it.\\
167 - You do, indeed.\\
168 - Don't you care where I was?\\
169 - Why would I start now?\\
170 - Oh, come on, I really need to get this off my chest.\\
171 - ( sighs )\\
172 - All right, go ahead.\\
173 - I was with another woman.\\
174 - Okay, see, that's a good lie.\\
175 - No, no, I really was with another woman.\\
176 - Seriously?\\
177 - You're already doing a hot 22-year-old,\\
178 - and you're cheating on her?\\
179 - Yes.\\
180 - I am so proud of you!\\
181 - What?\\
182 - Who's the dog? My brother's the dog!\\
183 - ( howling )\\
184 - Come on, dog, come on, dog, howl with me!\\
185 - ( howling )\\
186 - ( howling )\\
187 - Now, stop howling,\\
188 - and let me explain.\\
189 - There's nothing to explain.\\
190 - You're sleeping with two women at the same time.\\
191 - You're a big ol' dog! ( howls )\\
192 - I haven't been sleeping with the other woman.\\
193 - ( howls inquisitively )\\
194 - I've been seeing Jake's teacher.\\
195 - ( howls inquisitively )\\
196 - All we do is talk.\\
197 - ( howls weakly )\\
198 - I don't know how to explain it,\\
199 - we just have so much in common.\\
200 - I mean, she's divorced,\\
201 - she has a kid Jake's age,\\
202 - she reads, she likes the theater...\\
203 - Yeah, yeah, but you're not sleeping with her?\\
204 - Why would I sleep with her when I've got Kandi?\\
205 - I don't know... 'cause you can?\\
206 - It's not that kind of relationship.\\
207 - It's-it's intellectual.\\
208 - So? Take her to a museum, enjoy the exhibits,\\
209 - and do her in the restroom!\\
210 - You're missing the point. No, no, no, no.\\
211 - You're missing the point.\\
212 - If you're not getting laid, it's not cheating.\\
213 - Then why do I feel so guilty?\\
214 - Well, that's easy-- 'cause you're an idiot.\\
215 - I guess I just always thought that one woman\\
216 - was supposed to fulfill all my needs.\\
217 - Oh, that's an old wives' tale,\\
218 - started to protect the interests of,\\
219 - you guessed it, old wives.\\
220 - So you're saying the whole concept of monogamy is a fraud?\\
221 - The institution of marriage is a sham?\\
222 - No, no, no.\\
223 - I'm just saying bang the teacher.\\
224 - Why does he make everything so complicated?\\
225 - * Men...\\
226 - There we go.\\
227 - "Blunderbuss."\\
228 - Oh, oh...\\
229 - Very elegant use of my "under."\\
230 - Thank you.\\
231 - Oh, boy. ( doorbell rings )\\
232 - I have more vowels than a Honolulu phone book.\\
233 - You're so clever, Alan.\\
234 - Thank you.\\
235 - You am smart, too.\\
236 - Hey, Alan, can I talk to you for a sec?\\
237 - Oh, sure. Excuse me.\\
238 - Hurry back.\\
239 - What's up?\\
240 - You tell me.\\
241 - Nothing, we're just playing Scrabble.\\
242 - And you know what, I decided you're right.\\
243 - There's absolutely nothing to feel guilty about.\\
244 - Good to know. 'Cause Kandi's here.\\
245 - Oh, okay. Um...\\
246 - It's not a problem. Uh, uh, uh, here's what we do.\\
247 - We?\\
248 - Come on, work with me!\\
249 - You go cover for me with Kandi\\
250 - and I'll get Francine the hell outta here.\\
251 - But I thought there was nothing to feel guilty about.\\
252 - Yeah, yeah, you know that and I know that.\\
253 - Now, go lie to Kandi about it.\\
254 - Fine, I'll tell her you went to Staples to see Roger.\\
255 - Who?\\
256 - Hey, why don't we go take a walk on the beach?\\
257 - What about the game?\\
258 - Screw the game. I concede. You win. Well played.\\
259 - All right.\\
260 - It is a beautiful night.\\
261 - Yeah, yeah, let's go enjoy it on the beach.\\
262 - Come on. Chop chop.\\
263 - Kandi?\\
264 - Wha...?\\
265 - Alan must've slipped out.\\
266 - You're lying to me, Charlie.\\
267 - No, I'm not.\\
268 - Oh, okay.\\
269 - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't you wanna know where he is?\\
270 - Where who is?\\
271 - Alan.\\
272 - Sure, why not?\\
273 - All right, the truth is...\\
274 - Alan is out trying to find the perfect gift for you.\\
275 - Really? Yes.\\
276 - He wants to surprise you with something extremely expensive.\\
277 - Ooh!\\
278 - Can you give me a hint?\\
279 - Well, let's see...\\
280 - it's something that's a girl's best friend\\
281 - and looks good wrapped around their neck.\\
282 - I'm getting a monkey?\\
283 - No, no, it's...\\
284 - Oh, good Lord.\\
285 - A diamond necklace.\\
286 - Oh, that's nice, too.\\
287 - Just remember, you didn't hear it from me.\\
288 - Then who'd I hear it from?\\
289 - Nobody.\\
290 - When he gives it to you,\\
291 - act surprised.\\
292 - Don't worry, I'll be really surprised.\\
293 - Good, good, good.\\
294 - So will he.\\
295 - ( slow piano chords playing )\\
296 - ( tunelessly ): * Nothing really matters\\
297 - * Anyone can see\\
298 - * Nothing really\\
299 - * Matters\\
300 - * Nothing really matters\\
301 - * To me.\\
302 - That's... that's... that's terrific.\\
303 - Wanna hear it again?\\
304 - No.\\
305 - W-We don't wanna strain your voice.\\
306 - You think I'm gonna do okay at the audition?\\
307 - Well, you never know how these things are gonna go. Yeah.\\
308 - Just hope I have a decent piano player.\\
309 - I thought you were working with him. What's the problem?\\
310 - Okay, there's a technical term we musicians use.\\
311 - Jake... stinks.\\
312 - Is there anything we can do?\\
313 - We can hope "stinks" suddenly becomes popular,\\
314 - but I wouldn't count on it.\\
315 - Oh, by the way, you need to buy Kandi a diamond necklace.\\
316 - Wh-what?\\
317 - You told me to cover for you.\\
318 - I said you were out buying her jewelry.\\
319 - That's all you could think of?\\
320 - Well, I could think of a lot of things,\\
321 - but only one made me laugh.\\
322 - I can't afford to buy her jewelry.\\
323 - I know.\\
324 - That's what makes it funny.\\
325 - * Men...\\
326 - It must've been so expensive.\\
327 - Yeah.\\
328 - You do realize this entitles you to extra special bonus sex.\\
329 - What is extra special bonus sex?\\
330 - It's whatever you want it to be.\\
331 - That sounds like fun.\\
332 - ( knocking at door )\\
333 - Go away!\\
334 - CHARLIE: Okay.\\
335 - I'll just play Scrabble till you're ready.\\
336 - Give me a sec.\\
337 - Please don't tell me Francine is here.\\
338 - Okay.\\
339 - Wait, wait, wait!\\
340 - Francine is here?\\
341 - Yeah, you want me to cover for you?\\
342 - Yes.\\
343 - I'm on it.\\
344 - Wait.\\
345 - Charlie, I'm begging you, no more jewelry.\\
346 - Don't worry, it's not funny twice.\\
347 - Sorry, he must've gone out.\\
348 - Oh, okay. Tell him I stopped by.\\
349 - Francine, wait.\\
350 - I can't do this.\\
351 - Do what?\\
352 - I'm not a good liar.\\
353 - I know where he is, I'm just not supposed to tell you.\\
354 - Well, the thing is,\\
355 - Alan does a lot of charity work.\\
356 - Really? Oh, yeah.\\
357 - Right now, for instance, he's down at the nursing home\\
358 - giving sponge baths to old people.\\
359 - They don't go out a lot, so they tend to get dusty.\\
360 - I had no idea.\\
361 - In fact, just the other night,\\
362 - he was down on Skid Row teaching salsa dancing to crack addicts.\\
363 - Oh, my goodness.\\
364 - They have the energy, they just lack the focus.\\
365 - But I think... I think what he's proudest of\\
366 - is his work with the kids.\\
367 - He takes runaways who've been forced to live on the streets\\
368 - and teaches them how to live in the woods.\\
369 - I don't really see the point,\\
370 - but those little urchins seem to thrive in the wild.\\
371 - It's like he's a saint.\\
372 - You must be so proud to have him as your brother.\\
373 - Well, truth be told, he does bring me a lot of joy.\\
374 - Thank you for telling me this, Charlie.\\
375 - You're welcome.\\
376 - Just promise me you won't embarrass him by bringing it up.\\
377 - Oh, not a word.\\
378 - I just hope I can be worthy of him.\\
379 - ( to himself ): And the plot moistens.\\
380 - * Men...\\
381 - Well, that's terrific, buddy.\\
382 - I'm so proud of you.\\
383 - Yeah, sure, I'll tell him.\\
384 - All right, love ya.\\
385 - Bye-bye.\\
386 - Guess what?\\
387 - Jake just got the lead in the school musical.\\
388 - The lead?\\
389 - What happened, did every other kid in school get mono?\\
390 - No, I think it was Francine.\\
391 - I think she cast Jake because of our relationship.\\
392 - You mean it's gotten physical?\\
393 - You're sleeping his way to the top?\\
394 - No, no, nothing happened between us.\\
395 - But I think she's fallen for me.\\
396 - Really?\\
397 - What makes you think that?\\
398 - Well, I had lunch with her today and she was looking at me with,\\
399 - I don't know, worship in her eyes...\\
400 - like I was. some kind of...\\
401 - Saint? Yes! Yes!\\
402 - How'd you know?\\
403 - Well, that's how I think of you.\\
404 - Very funny. But look,\\
405 - I've been doing my best not to lead her on,\\
406 - but I guess I just underestimated my allure.\\
407 - Say that again.\\
408 - What?\\
409 - That last part.\\
410 - You mean... I underestimated my allure?\\
411 - Yeah, that's it.\\
412 - I'm sorry, am I missing something?\\
413 - No, not a thing.\\
414 - Well, good.\\
415 - You see, Alan? That's how you lie.\\
416 - * Men...\\
417 - Pretty exciting, huh? Opening night.\\
418 - Well, having seen the previews, I'm betting closing night, too.\\
419 - Boy, this brings back memories.\\
420 - Sixth grade was the happiest two years of my life.\\
421 - Oh... it's the finger.\\
422 - So, Kandi, what's your favorite musical?\\
423 - The trombone.\\
424 - I can't believe you brought her here.\\
425 - I had to. Jake invited her.\\
426 - Is that a diamond necklace?\\
427 - You never gave me a diamond necklace.\\
428 - Yeah, well, you never gave me extra special bonus sex.\\
429 - Hi, Charlie.\\
430 - Hi. Who's this?\\
431 - This? Oh, this is Kandi.\\
432 - Hi. I'm with Alan.\\
433 - Oh, are you one of the young people he takes care of?\\
434 - Yep, good old Saint Alan.\\
435 - Just can't do enough for the kids.\\
436 - Look at this diamond necklace he gave me.\\
437 - He gave you a diamond necklace?\\
438 - Don't get the wrong idea. It wasn't to get me to have sex.\\
439 - Oh.\\
440 - I was already doing everything he wanted.\\
441 - I am as shocked as you are.\\
442 - * Men...\\
443 - * To fight the unbeatable foe\\
444 - * To bear with unbearable sorrow *\\
445 - * To run where the brave dare not go *\\
446 - * This is my quest\\
447 - ( mouthing )\\
448 - * To follow that star, no matter how hopeless *\\
449 - * No matter how far\\
450 - * And the world will be better for this *\\
451 - * That one man, scorned and covered with scars... *\\
452 - What was that about?\\
453 - Funny story. I'll tell you later.\\
454 - * To reach the unreachable staaaaaaarrrrrs! *
\subsection {Episode 22: Just Once With Aunt Sophie}
1 - Hey.\\
2 - Hey.\\
3 - So, what's going on in school?\\
4 - Nothing.\\
5 - Nothing? You just sit there all day\\
6 - and stare at the wall?\\
7 - That's where the clock is.\\
8 - ( phonerings )\\
9 - CHARLIE: I got it.\\
10 - Well, I find it hard to believe\\
11 - that you just watch the clock all day.\\
12 - Have you seen my report card?\\
13 - Jake, it's for you.\\
14 - I'm busy.\\
15 - It's a girl.\\
16 - I don't care.\\
17 - Her name is Wendy Cho.\\
18 - Hold on! I'm coming! Don't hang up!\\
19 - Hey. How's it going?\\
20 - Okay, that's something we haven't seen before.\\
21 - Yeah. He only moves that fast when he's got the squirts.\\
22 - Wendy Cho is the smartest girl at school.\\
23 - I wonder why she's calling Jake.\\
24 - Maybe she lost a bet.\\
25 - That's not nice.\\
26 - Well, kids are cruel.\\
27 - Jake is obviously smitten with her.\\
28 - I just hope he's not setting himself up for disappointment.\\
29 - Hey, you know what they say:\\
30 - "A man's reach must exceed his grasp\\
31 - or what's a penis for?"\\
32 - Who says that?\\
33 - Okay, I might be paraphrasing.\\
34 - * Men, men, men, men, manly, men, men, men *\\
35 - * Oh. * Men...\\
36 - Hey, Dad? Yeah, Jake?\\
37 - Wendy Cho's having a party tomorrow night. Can I go?\\
38 - Tomorrow? A little last minute, isn't it?\\
39 - Well, she wasn't going to invite me\\
40 - 'cause Danny Palmer told Amy Sherlack\\
41 - that I didn't like her,\\
42 - but I told Peter Calahan to tell Ellen Meisner\\
43 - that I kinda did.\\
44 - I see.\\
45 - You do?\\
46 - He lost me at Amy Sherlack.\\
47 - Are her parents going to be there?\\
48 - I guess.\\
49 - Let the fathers who have girls\\
50 - worry about that.\\
51 - Shut up.\\
52 - All right. I'm going to want to meet her parents,\\
53 - but I don't see any reason why you can't go.\\
54 - Cool. Oh, yeah. I'm going a new shirt, new pants and new shoes.\\
55 - What's wrong with those you've got?\\
56 - Are you kidding? Everybody's already seen them.\\
57 - Yeah, but not with all the latest food stains.\\
58 - I hear gravy's the new black.\\
59 - Fine. We'll go shopping tomorrow.\\
60 - How about a new haircut?\\
61 - What's wrong with my hair?\\
62 - Let's just say everybody's already seen it.\\
63 - Okay. New haircut.\\
64 - So, this is your first party with girls, huh?\\
65 - Maybe.\\
66 - Maybe? You're not sure?\\
67 - You got some cross-dressers in sixth grade?\\
68 - Playing a little pin the tail on the tranny?\\
69 - Shut up.\\
70 - Why does everyone keep telling me to shut up?\\
71 - 'Cause you're an insensitive dolt.\\
72 - That's no reason.\\
73 - This is a very delicate time in a boy's life.\\
74 - I remember how nervous I was\\
75 - about my first boy-girl party.\\
76 - Oh, right. That was in college, wasn't it?\\
77 - Shut up.\\
78 - What's important now is that we support Jake.\\
79 - Agreed. I'll kick in the wine coolers\\
80 - and a package of condoms. What are you going to do?\\
81 - You're joking, right?\\
82 - Okay, let's say I'm joking.\\
83 - Look, I appreciate your interest\\
84 - but this is a father-son moment\\
85 - and, in fact, it's one that I've been looking forward to\\
86 - since I saw the shadow of his little dingus in the first sonogram.\\
87 - That's very touching,\\
88 - and more than a bit creepy.\\
89 - But, still, I can't risk letting you scar the kid forever.\\
90 - What do you mean by that?\\
91 - Face it, Alan. What can you bring to the table\\
92 - other than a lifetime of abject failure with women?\\
93 - It's not a lifetime yet.\\
94 - I, on the other hand,\\
95 - have a wealth of experience to offer.\\
96 - He's 12. He doesn't need to know how to choreograph a three-way.\\
97 - I'm not talking about that.\\
98 - I'm saving that for prom night.\\
99 - Oh, good.\\
100 - Let me give you an example.\\
101 - Jake's at the party.\\
102 - All the boys are on one side of the room,\\
103 - all the girls are on the other. What's he do?\\
104 - Um...\\
105 - You see? You see?\\
106 - Right there-- that "um..."-- is the battle cry\\
107 - of the chronic masturbator.\\
108 - Define "chronic."\\
109 - The solution to the problem, my hairy-palmed friend...\\
110 - ...is to walk right up to the prettiest girl there\\
111 - and ask her to dance.\\
112 - Why the prettiest girl?\\
113 - Because she's the one\\
114 - all the other guys are afraid of.\\
115 - She'll be dying for some attention.\\
116 - What if Wendy Cho isn't the prettiest girl at the party?\\
117 - It doesn't matter.\\
118 - When she sees our boy dancing with a hot chick,\\
119 - she'll be all over him.\\
120 - Of course.\\
121 - It's... it's so obvious.\\
122 - Bet you're wishing you could do over sixth grade now, huh?\\
123 - I could have danced with Heidi Winkler.\\
124 - Yeah, you could have.\\
125 - Or... or Pam Talega. Yep.\\
126 - Or Mary Beth Hicks. Uh-huh.\\
127 - Shoshana Wasserstein!\\
128 - Ooh. I don't think so.\\
129 - * Men...\\
130 - Hey, can I get leather pants?\\
131 - No. No.\\
132 - Why not?\\
133 - Because you need something that lets the farts out.\\
134 - So... Wendy Cho, huh?\\
135 - Real subtle, Alan.\\
136 - Charlie, it's a father-son thing.\\
137 - Yeah, so was prewar Iraq.\\
138 - You, uh, want to tell me about her?\\
139 - Not really.\\
140 - Is she in your class?\\
141 - Where else would I meet her, in a bar?\\
142 - My turn? No.\\
143 - I'm just curious\\
144 - about what kind of person she is,\\
145 - what is about her that you find--\\
146 - I don't know-- alluring.\\
147 - What?\\
148 - Your dad wants to know if you think she's hot.\\
149 - Oh.\\
150 - It's personal.\\
151 - She's hot.\\
152 - Are you nervous about this party?\\
153 - I don't know, maybe a little.\\
154 - Okay, Jake, here's what you do. Charlie.\\
155 - Hey, hey, you had your shot.\\
156 - "Alluring"?\\
157 - Is there going to be dancing tonight?\\
158 - I think so. Terrific.\\
159 - Do you know how to dance?\\
160 - Not exactly.\\
161 - Don't worry; it's easy to fake.\\
162 - The thing to remember is the more you move your arms,\\
163 - the stupider you look.\\
164 - Oh, that is so not true.\\
165 - Just keep it simple, and you'll be fine. Okay.\\
166 - Besides, the critical time is between dances.\\
167 - What do you mean?\\
168 - That's when you talk, or more precisely,\\
169 - you get her to talk.\\
170 - About what?\\
171 - Doesn't matter-- you won't be listening anyway.\\
172 - Oh, Charlie.\\
173 - Just drive the car.\\
174 - Yeah, Dad, this is important.\\
175 - Keep in mind: you're not looking to score tonight,\\
176 - you're just trying to get into the batter's box.\\
177 - Wendy doesn't like sports.\\
178 - You're missing the point.\\
179 - She plays violin.\\
180 - Listen to me.\\
181 - Your goal for the party tonight is to convince Wendy Cho\\
182 - that you're a mature, sophisticated guy\\
183 - who sees her not just as a woman but as a complete human being.\\
184 - You got it?\\
185 - I think so. Good.\\
186 - I'm not going.\\
187 - Hey, hey, not only are you going to go,\\
188 - but it's going to be a night you'll remember\\
189 - for the rest of your life.\\
190 - That's what I'm afraid of.\\
191 - * Men...\\
192 - Oh, oh, this is nice.\\
193 - Yeah, sure, if he's doing the other kids' taxes.\\
194 - It's a timeless style.\\
195 - No, it just seems timeless when you're not getting laid.\\
196 - Put it back.\\
197 - JAKE: This is cool.\\
198 - CHARLIE: Yeah, just one question:\\
199 - is your Wendy Cho a voodoo priestess?\\
200 - No, I think she's Chinese.\\
201 - Put it back.\\
202 - You know, there's something to be said\\
203 - for letting him make his own choices here.\\
204 - Oh, that's a bunch of crap-- he's an idiot.\\
205 - If we let him, he'd go to that party\\
206 - in a Viking helmet and a cape.\\
207 - Ah. Here we go.\\
208 - Don't even think about it.\\
209 - What? It says, "I've got a little money,\\
210 - but I'm not a corporate drone."\\
211 - No, it says, "I'm pushing 40, and I can't deal with it."\\
212 - All right.\\
213 - Maybe the kid needs his own look.\\
214 - Jake, come here.\\
215 - What? CHARLIE: Just stand there.\\
216 - Let's try and visualize what your personal style might be.\\
217 - Okay.\\
218 - Maybe we should start with the haircut.\\
219 - * Men...\\
220 - Oh, my, has Mommy been trimming your hair with her teeth?\\
221 - What?\\
222 - Not to worry, Ricky loves a challenge.\\
223 - I'm guessing Ricky also loves\\
224 - pretending he's a taffy apple.\\
225 - You want to take him to your guy, with the shaking hands\\
226 - and the signed picture of Desi Arnaz on the wall?\\
227 - Desi Arnaz had beautiful hair.\\
228 - So, Charles, do we have a game plan,\\
229 - or shall I just follow my muse?\\
230 - Can I get a mohawk?\\
231 - No. No. No.\\
232 - I think we should just go\\
233 - for something young and hip.\\
234 - Like your hairstyle. Sure. Why not?\\
235 - You'd have to kill me.\\
236 - Just tighten it up a little, nothing extreme.\\
237 - Can you make it purple?\\
238 - No. No. No.\\
239 - Aw, man.\\
240 - Relax, Jake, Ricky knows what he's doing.\\
241 - He's been cutting my hair for years.\\
242 - Well, what if I don't want to look like you?\\
243 - What's wrong with the way I look?\\
244 - Nothing... if you're a statue in front of a Big Boy restaurant.\\
245 - Are you freakin' kidding me?\\
246 - Charlie.\\
247 - Kid should be so lucky.\\
248 - We'll wait over here.\\
249 - I'm buying the little wiseass a $75 haircut,\\
250 - and he's taking shots at me?\\
251 - You said it yourself: he has to find his own look.\\
252 - Yeah, well, let him find it on somebody else's MasterCard!\\
253 - Look at his point of view.\\
254 - What's his point of view?\\
255 - Well, put overalls on you,\\
256 - and you do kind of look like the Big Boy.\\
257 - Stand like this for me.\\
258 - Shut up.\\
259 - By the way...\\
260 - did you have "the talk" with him?\\
261 - Oh, sure, I mean, well, we've had a talk,\\
262 - you know, covered the basics.\\
263 - He knows where babies come from and how they got there.\\
264 - That's all? He's going to this party completely clueless\\
265 - about how much fun he can have between "Hi, how are you?"\\
266 - and "What do you mean you missed your period?"\\
267 - Charlie, it's a kids' party:\\
268 - pizza, soft drinks, a little dancing.\\
269 - Oh, really? You know what I was doing at his age?\\
270 - I don't want to hear it.\\
271 - Are you sure?\\
272 - It involves Shoshana Wasserstein.\\
273 - You danced with Shoshana Wasserstein?\\
274 - Actually, that's the one thing we didn't do.\\
275 - Nevertheless, I am Jake's father,\\
276 - and I happen to believe\\
277 - childhood should be a time of innocence.\\
278 - I agree-- childhood should be a time of innocence.\\
279 - And Bambi's mother shouldn't die,\\
280 - and lap dances should be complimentary\\
281 - after the fifth cocktail.\\
282 - But that's not\\
283 - the world we live in.\\
284 - This party tonight is the initial round\\
285 - in a lifelong process of sexual elimination.\\
286 - Oh, really?\\
287 - Think of it as musical chairs,\\
288 - but when the music stops, the guys who have a clue\\
289 - are sitting on a woman instead of a chair.\\
290 - The guys who have no clue,\\
291 - they'll spend their teenage years...\\
292 - Well,\\
293 - I certainly don't need to tell Dungeonmaster Alan.\\
294 - * Men...\\
295 - I'm ready.\\
296 - It's very nice. Yeah, I think we're good.\\
297 - Turn around.\\
298 - You're supposed to take the price tag off.\\
299 - But you said it was good to be seen in expensive clothes.\\
300 - You still want him to learn from his mistakes?\\
301 - Fine. Can we go now? Hang on.\\
302 - Let's see the dance moves.\\
303 - ( Charlie singing mid-tempo dance beat )\\
304 - Don't stare at your shoes.\\
305 - Eyes on the girl at all times.\\
306 - Pretend you care.\\
307 - ( Charlie singing )\\
308 - Good, good, good.\\
309 - Now, how do you stand when you know\\
310 - Wendy's looking at you?\\
311 - That's it.\\
312 - Little head bob.\\
313 - Show me the sleepy eyes.\\
314 - I said sleepy, not brain-dead.\\
315 - All right.\\
316 - Who's the man?\\
317 - I'm the man. Who's the man?\\
318 - I'm the man!\\
319 - Okay, let's go get 'em!\\
320 - ( singing dance beat )\\
321 - CHARLIE ( calls ): Alan! I'm coming!\\
322 - 2138...\\
323 - 2136...\\
324 - Try the house with the balloons tied to the mailbox.\\
325 - Oh. Right.\\
326 - Okay.\\
327 - Let's go.\\
328 - Where are you going?\\
329 - I want to meet her parents, say hello,\\
330 - find out when to pick you up.\\
331 - Alan, you take one step out of this car,\\
332 - I will beat your brains out with a tire iron.\\
333 - Thank you, Uncle Charlie.\\
334 - Have fun.\\
335 - Uh, call my cell when you want me to pick you...\\
336 - ( door closes )\\
337 - ...up.\\
338 - ( sighs ): There he goes.\\
339 - My son is attending his first boy-girl party.\\
340 - ( both sigh loudly )\\
341 - Who's that opening the door?\\
342 - Oh, that's, uh, that's Wendy Cho.\\
343 - Oh, good. She's cute.\\
344 - The kid's got taste.\\
345 - But she's, like, a foot taller than him.\\
346 - That's all right-- when they slow dance,\\
347 - his head'll be perfectly positioned.\\
348 - Oh, get your mind out of the gutter.\\
349 - Right. Like, you never copped a feel with your ear.\\
350 - No!\\
351 - Well... okay, once, with Aunt Sophie.\\
352 - But that was an accident.\\
353 - So you know what I'm talking about.\\
354 - Oh, yeah.\\
355 - * Men...\\
356 - Here you go.\\
357 - Thank you.\\
358 - ( laughs ): Oh, looks good.\\
359 - She's pretty, huh?\\
360 - Huh?\\
361 - Yeah, I guess.\\
362 - What's the matter with you?\\
363 - What if I sent him out there too soon?\\
364 - What if he's not ready?\\
365 - Don't beat yourself up. You did everything you could.\\
366 - There just wasn't enough time, damn it.\\
367 - It's out of our hands-- we just have\\
368 - to let nature take its course.\\
369 - Sounds good-- unfortunately,\\
370 - nature keeps telling him to scratch his ass.\\
371 - ( phone plays ring-tone )\\
372 - Oh, it's Jake.\\
373 - Oh, God, I knew it! Give me that.\\
374 - No, no, no, I got it.\\
375 - Hey, what's up, buddy?\\
376 - He wants to come home.\\
377 - Why? He just got there.\\
378 - Why? You just got there.\\
379 - He says it's personal.\\
380 - Give me that.\\
381 - Jake...\\
382 - Jake, I'm gonna talk you through this.\\
383 - Just pipe down and listen.\\
384 - Finish your cookie later!\\
385 - Where's Wendy Cho right now?\\
386 - Well, how many girls is she talking to?\\
387 - Okay, okay, you got to split her from the herd.\\
388 - Walk over and say you have something to ask her.\\
389 - Then take her hand and lead her away from her friends.\\
390 - Okay, then put the cookie down first!\\
391 - Now, when you have some privacy,\\
392 - I want you to look her right in the eye and say you were lying,\\
393 - you just wanted to be alone with her.\\
394 - It will, too, work!\\
395 - All right, call me back.\\
396 - ( sighs )\\
397 - God, I just wish I could be there with him.\\
398 - Me, too.\\
399 - Thanks.\\
400 - You ready for a refill?\\
401 - Sure.\\
402 - Are you okay?\\
403 - Yeah, I'm fine.\\
404 - I'm just worried about my nephew.\\
405 - He's at his first boy-girl party.\\
406 - Aw, that's adorable.\\
407 - Uh, he's, uh, he's my son.\\
408 - Uh-huh.\\
409 - How old is he?\\
410 - 12. Kid's the apple of my eye.\\
411 - You're so sweet.\\
412 - Uh, excuse me,\\
413 - officially, it's, uh, my apple, uh, and my eye.\\
414 - Okay.\\
415 - Connie.\\
416 - Charlie.\\
417 - Would you like some pie, Charlie?\\
418 - It's on the house.\\
419 - Your house or mine?\\
420 - ( laughs ): You're awful. Mine.\\
421 - Un-freakin'-believable.\\
422 - Look, Connie, I'm kind of tied up tonight,\\
423 - you know, with my nephew,\\
424 - but why don't you write your number on the bill? Hmm.\\
425 - Already did.\\
426 - What?\\
427 - He's my son.\\
428 - But I know how to use him.\\
429 - ( phone plays "Fur Elise" ring tone )\\
430 - Oh, it's Jake.\\
431 - Talk to me.\\
432 - No, you're the man.\\
433 - You're the man.\\
434 - Great. Keep me posted.\\
435 - Who's the man?\\
436 - Right.\\
437 - What? What?\\
438 - It's going well.\\
439 - * Men...\\
440 - He's gonna be one of the last to leave.\\
441 - That's a good sign.\\
442 - ( sighs ): Yeah.\\
443 - You tend to lose track of time\\
444 - when you're in a closet with a girl.\\
445 - Uh-huh.\\
446 - I just wish I could've covered kissing with him.\\
447 - Please, God, don't let him pucker.\\
448 - ( heavy sigh ) What's wrong?\\
449 - Oh, it's nothing.\\
450 - Don't worry, Wendy'll know what to do.\\
451 - She's probably been practicing with her girlfriends.\\
452 - Man, chicks are so lucky.\\
453 - It's not the kissing, it's... ( sighs )\\
454 - it's this whole thing.\\
455 - Hey, look, I'm sorry if I interfered\\
456 - with the father-son deal, Alan...\\
457 - No, no, no, you've, uh, you've done a great job.\\
458 - Jake's really lucky to have you.\\
459 - So what's the problem?\\
460 - I guess I'm a little jealous. Of what?\\
461 - Charlie, do you have any idea what it would've meant to me\\
462 - to have you take me under your wing the way you have with Jake?\\
463 - Oh, we're we go. Dad was gone\\
464 - and there was no one to teach me this stuff.\\
465 - You know how I found out about French kissing?\\
466 - Mom sliced a plum in half and stuck her tongue in it.\\
467 - Aw, you could've taken that secret to the grave.\\
468 - And that's not all she showed me.\\
469 - To this day I can't eat plums, dried apricots or b-bananas.\\
470 - All right, all right, I'm sorry.\\
471 - Look, I was young, I was selfish.\\
472 - I should've been there for you.\\
473 - You know, it's not too late.\\
474 - That's a real nice idea, buddy.\\
475 - But I'm afraid it is.\\
476 - JAKE: Hey.\\
477 - Hey.\\
478 - Well? How'd it go?\\
479 - Okay.\\
480 - J-Just okay? Alan, leave it alone.\\
481 - All right.\\
482 - So, Jake, congratulations.\\
483 - For what?\\
484 - You got lipstick all over your mouth.\\
485 - Aw, man!\\
486 - Relax, I was bluffing.\\
487 - Oh.\\
488 - But congratulations.\\
489 - Thanks.\\
490 - * Men...\\
491 - but I think Jake's off to a good start with the ladies.\\
492 - Yeah, listen, Charlie, um, don't take this the wrong way, but...\\
493 - I really don't want Jake to grow up like... you.\\
494 - Oh, Alan, how could I possibly take that the wrong way?\\
495 - No, I mean, I don't want him to be a player.\\
496 - I want him to value women\\
497 - and cherish his relationships with them.\\
498 - Hey, I value women.\\
499 - I cherish my relationships with them.\\
500 - But I take your point.\\
501 - Hey, Dad, how old do you have to be\\
502 - to get married?\\
503 - Uh, I guess 18. Why?\\
504 - Just wondering how long Wendy and I have to wait.\\
505 - One kiss, and he's ready to marry the girl.\\
506 - So?\\
507 - So you don't have to worry.\\
508 - He's definitely your son.
\subsection {Episode 23: Arguments for the Quickie}
1 - Yo, whassup?\\
2 - Oh, stop it.\\
3 - Hey, give me back my skully.\\
4 - This is not a skully.\\
5 - It's a ski cap\\
6 - your grandmother gave you for Christmas.\\
7 - Charlie, come on. He's just trying to find his look.\\
8 - Word.\\
9 - Word?\\
10 - There's a reindeer on it.\\
11 - Don't listen to him, Jake.\\
12 - I think it looks very dope on you.\\
13 - Oh, man!\\
14 - Hey, did you see\\
15 - that your former girlfriend's dance troupe is in town?\\
16 - Mia's here?\\
17 - Let me see that.\\
18 - Come on. Come on. Come on.\\
19 - Whoa, is somebody still carrying a torch?\\
20 - Torch? Don't be ridiculous.\\
21 - I mean, I'm glad to see\\
22 - she's following her dream,\\
23 - but I've moved on.\\
24 - You know, I think she called the other day.\\
25 - What?! When?!\\
26 - What'd she want?! What'd she say?!\\
27 - Um...\\
28 - Come on, kid, spill it!\\
29 - Nope, no unresolved feelings there.\\
30 - She wanted to talk to you, but you weren't home.\\
31 - I know that, you chowderhead.\\
32 - What else did she say?\\
33 - Uh, she said, "What's new?"\\
34 - I said, "Nothing much."\\
35 - She said, "How's school?"\\
36 - I said, "It sucks."\\
37 - Then she said, "That's too bad."\\
38 - I said, "Yeah."\\
39 - I'm going to kill him, Alan.\\
40 - I swear to God I'm going to kill him.\\
41 - Oh, yeah, she wants us to come see her dance next weekend.\\
42 - It says she's performing this weekend.\\
43 - Oh, I guess she called last weekend.\\
44 - You're telling me this now?! Charlie, Charlie, calm down.\\
45 - How many things does the kid have to handle?\\
46 - Eat, poop, tell me who called.\\
47 - She said some guy named Will has tickets.\\
48 - Who's Will?\\
49 - I don't know. She said he'd call.\\
50 - Will's going to call?\\
51 - You mean the tickets are at "Will Call"?\\
52 - I don't know. Maybe.\\
53 - Dear God, he's a doorstop that eats.\\
54 - Do me a favor.\\
55 - From now on,\\
56 - when somebody calls, write it down.\\
57 - I did.\\
58 - Where?\\
59 - On my homework.\\
60 - Okay. Where's your homework?\\
61 - Um... Oh, yeah.\\
62 - My teacher called. She wants to meet with you.\\
63 - When?\\
64 - I guess it was last week.\\
65 - Peace out.\\
66 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
67 - * Ooh... * Men.\\
68 - Mia left us four seats for Friday night.\\
69 - House seats, center orchestra.\\
70 - Huh.\\
71 - What do you think?\\
72 - You, me, Jake, Kandi, go out to dinner\\
73 - make an evening of it.\\
74 - Sounds like fun.\\
75 - Maybe afterwards you could tie me to an anthill\\
76 - and smear honey on my genitals.\\
77 - So you don't want to go?\\
78 - Geez, now I see where the kid gets his brains.\\
79 - No, I don't want to go.\\
80 - Why would I want to go?\\
81 - Um, because you were in love with the woman\\
82 - and obviously still have feelings for her\\
83 - and want to see her again.\\
84 - Oh, that's crazy.\\
85 - God, you are so naive.\\
86 - How am I naive?\\
87 - Oh, oh! I know this one.\\
88 - Alan,\\
89 - when an ex-girlfriend calls, no good can come from it.\\
90 - Unless, you know, it's 2:00 a.m., she's blind drunk\\
91 - and wants to get even with her new cheating boyfriend.\\
92 - She just wanted to invite us to the ballet.\\
93 - Yeah, right.\\
94 - And girls are completely unaware\\
95 - that you can see their nipples through their shirts.\\
96 - What does that have...?\\
97 - Really? They know?\\
98 - There's only a few reasons why an ex calls.\\
99 - One: they're doing great and want to rub your nose in it,\\
100 - or two: they're doing lousy and need to borrow money.\\
101 - Or three: they've got money from knocking over a Laundromat\\
102 - and want to hide under your trailer until the heat's off.\\
103 - It happens.\\
104 - Okay, okay. How about four:\\
105 - she misses you and wants to try again?\\
106 - What is it she's going to try?\\
107 - To change me into something I'm not\\
108 - to get me to stop drinking, smoking, gambling?\\
109 - To rescue me from the barren, loveless abyss\\
110 - my life has become?\\
111 - What?\\
112 - You know what I think?\\
113 - I think you were never happier than when you were with Mia.\\
114 - You still have feelings for her\\
115 - and you're just afraid to admit it.\\
116 - You are so wrong. You couldn't be more wrong!\\
117 - Believe that guy?\\
118 - You want the truth?\\
119 - No, probably not.\\
120 - Good call.\\
121 - Oh, by the way, here's the 20 bucks I owe ya.\\
122 - * Men...\\
123 - ALAN: I am telling you it is not appropriate\\
124 - to wear to the ballet.\\
125 - Why you trippin' on me?\\
126 - Hey, Alan.\\
127 - ( gruffly ): Matey.\\
128 - I'm not a pirate.\\
129 - You're not a gangsta either.\\
130 - You're a dorky white kid\\
131 - with a Cub Scout bandana on his head.\\
132 - Yo, hate the game, don't hate the playa.\\
133 - You know kids better than me.\\
134 - How, how long does this pimp stage last?\\
135 - Just ignore him.\\
136 - You sure you won't change your mind and come with us?\\
137 - Positive.\\
138 - Should I at least say hi to Mia for you?\\
139 - Say whatever you want.\\
140 - I'm meeting somebody at Pavlov's.\\
141 - Who?\\
142 - How would I know?\\
143 - I haven't met her yet.\\
144 - ( knocking )\\
145 - Hi, do I look okay?\\
146 - Perfect.\\
147 - Hey, no fair!\\
148 - You grow a rack like that,\\
149 - you can wear anything you want on your head.\\
150 - You have a house on the beach?\\
151 - I'd love to see it.\\
152 - I could take you there.\\
153 - Great.\\
154 - Then I could bring you out on my deck,\\
155 - we could watch the surf in the moonlight,\\
156 - then I could take you in my arms, kiss you.\\
157 - Not a big kiss.\\
158 - Just a little something that gives you a taste\\
159 - of what's to come.\\
160 - Well, let's go.\\
161 - Then I would take your hand and lead you up to my bedroom\\
162 - where I would slowly undress you,\\
163 - then lay you down on the crisp cool sheets\\
164 - and proceed to make wild, passionate love to you\\
165 - until we're both totally spent.\\
166 - Okay.\\
167 - Then in the morning, I'll bring you a cup of coffee\\
168 - and your car keys.\\
169 - Wow!\\
170 - Wait, my car keys?\\
171 - I'll promise to call you, but I never will.\\
172 - Then when you try to call me,\\
173 - you'll find that the phone number I gave you\\
174 - belongs to a dry cleaner in Koreatown.\\
175 - What?\\
176 - When all is said and done,\\
177 - you know what we'll both have? Nothing.\\
178 - Not even a good memory.\\
179 - So what do you say we do us both a favor\\
180 - and not go through with this whole pathetic charade?\\
181 - Okay.\\
182 - Geez, I was just trying to get laid.\\
183 - ( orchestral music playing )\\
184 - So, Jake, the swan is dying...\\
185 - Can you believe...?\\
186 - Pardon me. Excuse me.\\
187 - Hey, what did I miss?\\
188 - I thought you weren't coming.\\
189 - I'm not here for Mia.\\
190 - I'm here to support the arts.\\
191 - Yikes. Look at the package on that pretty dude.\\
192 - Hey, good job.\\
193 - Eat something.\\
194 - Charlie!\\
195 - Hey, you were terrific.\\
196 - Thank you.\\
197 - I am so glad you came.\\
198 - Are you kidding me? I've been looking forward to this all week.\\
199 - Dressed like that?\\
200 - Well, how else would you recognize me?\\
201 - These are for you.\\
202 - Thank you.\\
203 - They're... beautiful.\\
204 - No big deal.\\
205 - They had 'em at the liquor store.\\
206 - It was either this\\
207 - or a stack of Lotto scratchers.\\
208 - I think you made the wise choice.\\
209 - We'll never know, will we?\\
210 - By the way, Alan would have come back, too,\\
211 - but he had to take the kids home.\\
212 - The kids?\\
213 - He's kind of adopted a young girl.\\
214 - Really?\\
215 - Well, not so much adopted as banging.\\
216 - So you're looking good.\\
217 - You, too. How you been?\\
218 - Great, just great.\\
219 - Really great.\\
220 - Good.\\
221 - No, no. No, great.\\
222 - And you. How have you been?\\
223 - Wonderful.\\
224 - All right, then.\\
225 - I'm great and you're wonderful.\\
226 - What the hell are we doing here?\\
227 - Charlie, there was something I wanted to talk to you about.\\
228 - Hey, Mia, who's your cute friend?\\
229 - This is Charlie.\\
230 - Charlie, Theresa.\\
231 - Hey.\\
232 - So what do you want to talk about?\\
233 - This really isn't the right place.\\
234 - Why don't I get changed and I'll stop by your house in a little while?\\
235 - Sure, I'll be up because you know, I'm a night person.\\
236 - I remember.\\
237 - Of course, if you come too late I could be drunk.\\
238 - I remember.\\
239 - Or there could be other women there. I remember.\\
240 - See you later.\\
241 - Whatever.\\
242 - Hey, can you unhook me?\\
243 - * Men...\\
244 - ( romantic music plays )\\
245 - What's going on?\\
246 - Nothing.\\
247 - Mia's coming over so I thought I'd... Nothing.\\
248 - I see.\\
249 - What do you mean, you see?\\
250 - You're right.\\
251 - It's too much.\\
252 - How's that?\\
253 - Well, I...\\
254 - You're right.\\
255 - She'll smell that there were candles burning,\\
256 - so I have to light at least one.\\
257 - Now what about the music?\\
258 - What about it?\\
259 - You're right. It sounds like I'm trying too hard.\\
260 - ( "Camptown Races"playing )\\
261 - Better?\\
262 - Well...\\
263 - You're right.\\
264 - No music.\\
265 - Charlie?\\
266 - Yeah?\\
267 - I'm just glad you're over her.\\
268 - ( doorbell rings )\\
269 - Get the door.\\
270 - Get the door! Get the door!\\
271 - Hi, Alan.\\
272 - Hey, Mia. You were great tonight.\\
273 - Thanks. Did Jake like it?\\
274 - He was absolutely knocked out.\\
275 - Charlie, Mia's here.\\
276 - Oh, really? Well, ask her in.\\
277 - All right.\\
278 - Won't you come in?\\
279 - Hi, Mia. I almost forgot you were coming.\\
280 - Get out.\\
281 - Nice to see you again.\\
282 - Nice to see you, too.\\
283 - Sit down.\\
284 - Make yourself at home.\\
285 - Place looks the same.\\
286 - Well, you know me.\\
287 - If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\
288 - If it is broke, who gives a rat's ass?\\
289 - Can I get you a drink?\\
290 - No. I'm good.\\
291 - So am I. In fact, I'm great.\\
292 - Yeah. You mentioned that.\\
293 - Repeatedly.\\
294 - So, what did you want to talk about?\\
295 - Oh, boy, this is a hard thing to ask.\\
296 - You need some money.\\
297 - What?\\
298 - No.\\
299 - So, what?\\
300 - You want to get back together again?\\
301 - Oh, God, no.\\
302 - All right, then.\\
303 - How about a quickie for old times' sake?\\
304 - Please.\\
305 - Charlie, I think you're a terrific guy.\\
306 - You're smart, you're handsome, you're talented...\\
307 - All good arguments for the quickie.\\
308 - Will you let me finish?\\
309 - Didn't I always?\\
310 - Okay. Sorry.\\
311 - I've been thinking a lot lately\\
312 - about what I want out of life.\\
313 - I love dancing, but let's face it,\\
314 - I'm not getting any younger.\\
315 - So the time has come for me to make some tough choices.\\
316 - I understand completely.\\
317 - You do?\\
318 - Nah. I'm just trying\\
319 - to be supportive.\\
320 - Charlie, I came here because...\\
321 - Well...\\
322 - I want your sperm.\\
323 - All right. Where do you want it?\\
324 - Alan! Alan! Wake up! Wake up!\\
325 - What?\\
326 - Mia wants sperm.\\
327 - Well, don't look at me.\\
328 - No. She wants my sperm.\\
329 - She wants me to make a deposit so she can have a baby.\\
330 - You're kidding. Apparently, that's another one of its uses.\\
331 - What the hell is that?\\
332 - I'm not sure.\\
333 - Near as I can tell, she's chasing a rabbit.\\
334 - So why did Mia come to you?\\
335 - Well, it turns out her biological clock is ticking.\\
336 - Most of the guys she meets are ballet dancers,\\
337 - so, you know, slim pickin's there.\\
338 - And she doesn't want to wait\\
339 - for Mr. Right to come along.\\
340 - Which pretty much leaves you.\\
341 - Yep. I'm good genetic material, you know?\\
342 - Easy on the eyes.\\
343 - And she wants to raise the kid alone,\\
344 - which fits nicely into my lifestyle.\\
345 - Charlie, drinking, gambling and casual sex\\
346 - is not a lifestyle.\\
347 - Look, I didn't come in here to argue with you.\\
348 - Look in the hedges. Look in the hedges.\\
349 - What?\\
350 - I don't know.\\
351 - So... so what are you... what are you gonna do?\\
352 - You gonna go to a sperm bank?\\
353 - Well, I tried to talk her into a direct deposit.\\
354 - You know, straight from the tap.\\
355 - But she really dug in her heels.\\
356 - And not in the good way.\\
357 - And you're okay with it?\\
358 - Well, why not? I've sent billions of soldiers out there.\\
359 - It's time for one of them to finally take the hill.\\
360 - ( growling )\\
361 - Now what?\\
362 - I think she caught the rabbit.\\
363 - Oh. Anyway, this could be my one chance\\
364 - to guarantee the Charlie gene lives on.\\
365 - You know, make sure that the double helix that is uniquely me\\
366 - keeps on truckin' into the future.\\
367 - Okay, okay, let's assume that's a good thing.\\
368 - One more question. Yeah?\\
369 - If you have no doubts about this,\\
370 - why did you wake me up to tell me?\\
371 - Well, you're my brother,\\
372 - and I thought you should know\\
373 - you're going to be an uncle.\\
374 - You mean, I'm going to be an uncle\\
375 - to a child I'll never see.\\
376 - Tell you what.\\
377 - When he turns 12, I'll track him down,\\
378 - bring him to live with you,\\
379 - and we'll see if you get your phone messages.\\
380 - * Men...\\
381 - What do you think?\\
382 - Looks like pretty standard boilerplate.\\
383 - It basically says that once your swim team's off the bus,\\
384 - you're no longer the coach.\\
385 - All right. Let's see.\\
386 - Where do I sign?\\
387 - The ol' John Hancock, if you will.\\
388 - Are you sure you want to?\\
389 - You're giving up the rights not only to your sperm,\\
390 - but to any children that might result from them-- it.\\
391 - I understand. Do you?\\
392 - Once you sign, Mia can do whatever she wants with it-- them.\\
393 - She can use it, resell it,\\
394 - freeze it, put it on eBay...\\
395 - I don't care if she uses it to caulk her bathtub.\\
396 - Once the boys reach escape velocity, they're on their own.\\
397 - I see.\\
398 - It's out of my hands, so to speak.\\
399 - I get it.\\
400 - Okay. I'll be back in two shakes.\\
401 - Three, if it's cold in there.\\
402 - Charlie, you okay?\\
403 - ( man yelling angrily in Spanish )\\
404 - Lo siento, se  or.\\
405 - Charlie?\\
406 - What?!\\
407 - Well, you've been in there a long time.\\
408 - How is it going?\\
409 - How do you think it's going?\\
410 - Well, I don't know if this will help,\\
411 - but sometimes, when I was married,\\
412 - I used to pretend that I was having sex\\
413 - with a completely different woman.\\
414 - Oh, thanks.\\
415 - The image of you bumping uglies with your ex-wife\\
416 - should really move things along.\\
417 - Excuse me. I was just trying to help.\\
418 - Yeah, well, I was just trying to have sex with a cup.\\
419 - Don't think of it as a cup.\\
420 - Think of it as a... a polyurethane lap dancer.\\
421 - ( thump on door )\\
422 - Hello.\\
423 - Charlie, I was just getting packed.\\
424 - Oh, right, you're heading to San Francisco.\\
425 - That's got to be a big ballet town.\\
426 - So, did you go to the sperm bank?\\
427 - Uh-huh.\\
428 - And?\\
429 - Not a lot of laughs in that place.\\
430 - I asked the receptionist\\
431 - if she ever takes her work home with her.\\
432 - Nothing. Not even a smile.\\
433 - Thanks for doing this.\\
434 - You have no idea what it means to me.\\
435 - Yeah, well, funny thing.\\
436 - Turns out it means something to me, too.\\
437 - What are you talking about?\\
438 - I tried, Mia, I really did.\\
439 - I tried the magazines, the movies.\\
440 - You can't imagine how bad porn acting is until you\\
441 - actually watch more than three, four minutes at a time.\\
442 - So you're saying you couldn't? You?\\
443 - Yeah, I know.\\
444 - What are the odds, huh?\\
445 - Well, I guess these things happen.\\
446 - You'll try again, and I'm sure you'll do fine.\\
447 - I don't think so.\\
448 - Why not?\\
449 - Well, I have some thoughts about the reason\\
450 - things didn't go down as planned, or, actually, up.\\
451 - Okay, I'm listening.\\
452 - As I was sitting in that little sperm cubicle,\\
453 - watching Assmasters 7, The Final Chapter,\\
454 - all I could think about was some kid of mine\\
455 - growing up somewhere, and-and me not having a chance to,\\
456 - you know, be a part of his life.\\
457 - I thought you were okay with that.\\
458 - I thought I was, too, but, as it turns out, I'm not.\\
459 - So, if this is something you really want to do,\\
460 - then you're going to have to find someone else.\\
461 - I see.\\
462 - And, by the way,\\
463 - Assmasters 7 is not the final chapter.\\
464 - They left a lot of loose ends.\\
465 - All right, well, I got to go.\\
466 - I appreciate the effort.\\
467 - Yeah, thanks.\\
468 - I think I have a rotator cuff injury.\\
469 - Good seeing you again, Charlie.\\
470 - Good seeing you, too.\\
471 - Let me float another idea by you.\\
472 - What?\\
473 - It's a little crazy, a little unorthodox,\\
474 - but if you really want a kid, this could be the solution.\\
475 - Charlie, I am not having sex with you.\\
476 - Who said anything about having sex?\\
477 - I'm asking you to marry me.\\
478 - There's no Charlie here.\\
479 - Why you stupid girls keep calling?\\
480 - No, listen, I don't take message.\\
481 - I do dry cleaning.\\
482 - One more time, there's no Charlie here!
\subsection {Episode 24: That Pistol-Packin' Hermaphrodite}
1 - Hello...?\\
2 - Anybody...?\\
3 - Big news!\\
4 - I'm gonna marry Mia!\\
5 - ( water running ) Hey, Alan!\\
6 - I'm in the shower.\\
7 - Guess what I'm gonna do with Mia.\\
8 - Guess what I'm already doing with Kandi.\\
9 - That's not fair, Alan,\\
10 - you have to give him a hint.\\
11 - He doesn't need a hint.\\
12 - Well, then how's he supposed to guess?\\
13 - Oh, well.\\
14 - Oh, a place to hang my wash cloth.\\
15 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
16 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
17 - is that the price should equal three months salary.\\
18 - Ouch.\\
19 - Wonder what broad came up with that?\\
20 - It wasn't a broad, it was a marketing scheme\\
21 - dreamed up by the international diamond cartel.\\
22 - Probably a bunch of chicks.\\
23 - But at least diamonds are forever, right?\\
24 - Oh, yeah, forever.\\
25 - My ex-wife still has hers.\\
26 - Meanwhile, I'm wearing mismatched socks\\
27 - from the irregular bin.\\
28 - Well, Mia and I are going to go the distance--\\
29 - 15, maybe 20 years.\\
30 - That's not the distance.\\
31 - The distance is death.\\
32 - Hey, if I'm still married after 20 years, kill me.\\
33 - I can't believe you're doing this at all.\\
34 - Why not?\\
35 - Why shouldn't someone like me\\
36 - settle down with a wife and kids?\\
37 - Boy, I don't know where to start.\\
38 - That's the old Charlie you're thinking of.\\
39 - Oh, okay.\\
40 - And to whom am I speaking now?\\
41 - May I help you, gentlemen? Yeah.\\
42 - We're looking for an engagement ring.\\
43 - How nice.\\
44 - Do you have anything in mind?\\
45 - Ah...\\
46 - Nothing ostentatious.\\
47 - Something in a brilliant cut,\\
48 - perhaps with complementary baguettes.\\
49 - Size isn't as important as color and clarity.\\
50 - Well, someone knows what he wants.\\
51 - What can I say?\\
52 - He's my life.\\
53 - * Men...\\
54 - So basically, I asked her to marry me\\
55 - and she said yes.\\
56 - Huh.\\
57 - What do you think about that, Jake?\\
58 - Good.\\
59 - That's it? Good?\\
60 - It's not good?\\
61 - No, it's good.\\
62 - That's what I said.\\
63 - All right, I'm full.\\
64 - He wears his little heart on his sleeve, doesn't he?\\
65 - Ah, it's my own fault.\\
66 - I should've known better than to talk to him at feeding time.\\
67 - ( knocking on door )\\
68 - Charlie, I need to speak to you.\\
69 - I'll be right out, Rose.\\
70 - Did you tell her?\\
71 - Of course not.\\
72 - Would you? No.\\
73 - I'll let you be my best man.\\
74 - You mean I'm not?\\
75 - Well, you're on the short list,\\
76 - but this could cinch it.\\
77 - Come on, Charlie, that woman\\
78 - has been obsessed with you for years.\\
79 - She's gonna find out about your engagement sooner or later.\\
80 - Let it come from you.\\
81 - Yeah, I guess.\\
82 - Besides, she has a boyfriend now.\\
83 - She probably won't even care. Probably not.\\
84 - So why won't you tell her?\\
85 - Because if I want my eyebrows shaved,\\
86 - I'll shave them myself.\\
87 - Hey, Rosey Rose.\\
88 - What's up, Rosey Rose?\\
89 - Gordon dumped me.\\
90 - Oh, damn it to hell.\\
91 - I know, it's awful.\\
92 - How could he do this?\\
93 - He said he couldn't be with me anymore\\
94 - knowing that I'm still in love with you.\\
95 - Oh, no. No, no, no, no.\\
96 - Yes, yes, yes, yes.\\
97 - Listen, Rose...\\
98 - there's something I have to tell you.\\
99 - Is it good news?\\
100 - I could use some good news.\\
101 - Well...\\
102 - you remember Mia?\\
103 - Yeah. Ugh.\\
104 - Don't tell me you're dating her again.\\
105 - No, no, no. We're not dating.\\
106 - Good. 'Cause I always thought she was kind of a head case.\\
107 - ( chuckling )\\
108 - Look, the thing is I'm gonna kind of marry her.\\
109 - Rose?\\
110 - Did you hear me?\\
111 - I heard you.\\
112 - You're going to marry Mia.\\
113 - So...\\
114 - are you okay?\\
115 - Sure.\\
116 - Why wouldn't I be okay?\\
117 - Well, I-I-I was afraid the news\\
118 - might come as a bit of a shock to you.\\
119 - Afraid? There's nothing to be afraid of, Charlie.\\
120 - You're my friend.\\
121 - Where are you going?\\
122 - I have things to do.\\
123 - What kind of things? Things.\\
124 - Good-bye, Charlie.\\
125 - Hello, Alan.\\
126 - Hello.\\
127 - Did she just use the front door?\\
128 - Uh-huh.\\
129 - She's never used the front door before.\\
130 - Nuh-uh.\\
131 - What happened out there?\\
132 - Well, I-I told her I was going to marry Mia,\\
133 - and I think I could actually see her medication stop working.\\
134 - Whoa.\\
135 - What do you think she's going to do?\\
136 - The question isn't what, it's when...\\
137 - and how I'm going to enjoy my honeymoon\\
138 - with my testicles glued to my ass crack.\\
139 - * Men...\\
140 - That's a pretty wedding gown.\\
141 - Oh, yeah.\\
142 - I could probably crawl under there during the reception\\
143 - and no one would have a clue.\\
144 - Well, you would.\\
145 - Stop.\\
146 - I don't think you'd say that.\\
147 - Isn't it beautiful?\\
148 - You know, they say you're supposed to spend\\
149 - three months salary, but I went four.\\
150 - Because I'm worth it?\\
151 - No, actually, I had a slow first quarter.\\
152 - Hey, my dad called today.\\
153 - He wants to take your family out for a nice dinner.\\
154 - Yeah, well, tell him\\
155 - he can have one or the other, but not both.\\
156 - Come on, Charlie,\\
157 - they're going to have to meet sooner or later.\\
158 - Okay, but why don't we wait for a real happy occasion?\\
159 - What's happier than a wedding?\\
160 - Well, my mother's funeral springs to mind.\\
161 - There'll be music, dancing,\\
162 - my mom will be in a box.\\
163 - That's a gorgeous wedding cake.\\
164 - It's okay. I'm not big\\
165 - on having the little action figures on top.\\
166 - They kind of creep me out.\\
167 - They're traditional.\\
168 - Hey, this is our wedding.\\
169 - We can do whatever we want.\\
170 - We don't even have to have cake.\\
171 - We can have... pie.\\
172 - A wedding pie?\\
173 - Well, we'll probably need more than one.\\
174 - You know, so everybody gets some crust.\\
175 - Alan, what do you think about a wedding with no cake?\\
176 - No cake?\\
177 - Where would you put the little bride and groom?\\
178 - I can think of one place.\\
179 - Charlie, if you're going to do a wedding, do it right.\\
180 - Thank you, Alan.\\
181 - You're welcome. Oh, which reminds me...\\
182 - I just found my old wedding folder\\
183 - and guess what was in it?\\
184 - The claim check for your manhood?\\
185 - As I was saying, it's all here,\\
186 - everything you could possibly need for your big day--\\
187 - from paper samples for your announcements\\
188 - to selected verses of romantic poetry\\
189 - well-suited for wedding vows.\\
190 - And you wonder why people think you're gay.\\
191 - Oh, shush.\\
192 - Now you're talking cake,\\
193 - but we are light-years away from cake.\\
194 - First, we have to discuss the budget,\\
195 - the venue, how many guests,\\
196 - is it going to be a sit- down dinner or a buffet?\\
197 - Then you need to hire a photographer\\
198 - and a videographer, then a florist.\\
199 - Have you even thought about flowers?\\
200 - Well, lilies are nice.\\
201 - Oh, lilies are perfect\\
202 - if the bride and groom are recently deceased.\\
203 - But I like lilies.\\
204 - Mia, we will never get through this if you don't focus.\\
205 - Uh, now...\\
206 - wedding party.\\
207 - Bridesmaids, what are they wearing?\\
208 - I suggest an unflattering style in a hideous color,\\
209 - because after all, this is your day.\\
210 - Oh, oh, and before I forget,\\
211 - although it's not politically correct to throw rice,\\
212 - if you throw birdseed, you run the risk\\
213 - of your wedding ending like a Hitchcock movie.\\
214 - What kind of pie did you have in mind?\\
215 - Well, look who's here, the bride of Drunkenstein.\\
216 - Wow, that's quite a rock.\\
217 - You know what we call babes\\
218 - with rings like that in my neighborhood?\\
219 - Stumpy.\\
220 - What are you looking at me for?\\
221 - Just stay out of her neighborhood.\\
222 - That was uncomfortable.\\
223 - No,\\
224 - sand in my urethra is uncomfortable.\\
225 - That meal was a freaking disaster.\\
226 - I'm going to stay with my family,\\
227 - try and calm my mother down.\\
228 - The miserable bitch.\\
229 - Your family hates me, don't they?\\
230 - Not just you.\\
231 - I'll call you later.\\
232 - Do you believe your future mother-in-law?\\
233 - Shows up at a four-star restaurant wearing a track suit\\
234 - with the word "juicy" stretched across her half-acre ass.\\
235 - I can read, Mom.\\
236 - Can we go back? I forgot my doggie bag.\\
237 - We can never go back, Jake.\\
238 - Oh, come on, it's not the end of the world.\\
239 - Easy for you to say,\\
240 - you're not marrying into the Addams family.\\
241 - Oh, like you were a prize.\\
242 - Slipping a prenuptial agreement into my fiancee's menu?!\\
243 - I am just trying to protect you\\
244 - from being wiped out by a vindictive ex-wife\\
245 - who will use your hard-earned money\\
246 - to finance her frivolous life of partying and shopping\\
247 - and unnecessary plastic surgery.\\
248 - Um, Mom...?\\
249 - Every one of my surgeries was necessary.\\
250 - And if I had signed a prenup,\\
251 - you would never have gone to music camp...\\
252 - and Alan would have an overbite\\
253 - you could use to open a can of Pennzoil.\\
254 - I didn't know Mia's last name was Addams.\\
255 - I didn't know her sister's a cop.\\
256 - Was a cop.\\
257 - Now she's a dry drunk with a grudge and a .38.\\
258 - Well, I liked her.\\
259 - Well, that's because she had the same haircut as you.\\
260 - I was a little shocked\\
261 - that her father stuck you with the bill.\\
262 - You know why you noticed that?\\
263 - Because the two of you practically trampled each other\\
264 - trying to get to the men's room\\
265 - when you saw the waiter bringing it.\\
266 - I drank a lot of iced tea.\\
267 - Well, I had a very nice time.\\
268 - Sure. You got to inform my bride-to-be\\
269 - and her entire family\\
270 - that you had sex with me before you had sex with him.\\
271 - I was just telling Mia I know how lucky she is.\\
272 - Nevertheless, honey, it was not an appropriate toast.\\
273 - Juicy-pants almost choked to death on her lamb shank.\\
274 - Well, in all fairness,\\
275 - the woman was stuffing her face like a musket.\\
276 - All I can say is, after tonight's little fiasco,\\
277 - I'm going to have to completely rethink\\
278 - the seating chart for the wedding.\\
279 - Yeah, well, it won't be that complicated.\\
280 - Why not?\\
281 - Because none of you are invited.\\
282 - * Men...\\
283 - Well, Mom, if you wear an animal-print track suit\\
284 - to a nice restaurant, people are gonna make comments.\\
285 - I agree. Calling you "a cougar with arm fat"\\
286 - was over the line.\\
287 - ( knocking )\\
288 - Hang on.\\
289 - Hello, Mia.\\
290 - I'll call you back.\\
291 - * Men...\\
292 - You don't think Mia's gonna turn into her mother, do you?\\
293 - I wouldn't worry about it.\\
294 - Yeah.\\
295 - What I would worry about\\
296 - is you turning her into our mother.\\
297 - Thanks for ruining my wedding night, Dr. Freud.\\
298 - Hey, hey, don't set the bar too high for the wedding night.\\
299 - What're you talking about?\\
300 - Well, it's a long, stressful day.\\
301 - You'll be exhausted,\\
302 - full of banquet food and cheap champagne.\\
303 - Take my advice.\\
304 - Tell her you love her,\\
305 - give her a big kiss and try to fall asleep\\
306 - with your ass pointed toward an open window.\\
307 - You, sir, have the heart of a poet.\\
308 - I am merely the voice of smelly experience.\\
309 - Well, let me ask you this.\\
310 - I know things didn't end well with you and Judith,\\
311 - but overall, did you, did you like being married?\\
312 - Oh, I loved being married.\\
313 - You never missed having sex with other women?\\
314 - Sure. But I missed that before I got married, too.\\
315 - What I loved was the idea of having someone\\
316 - that I could always turn to,\\
317 - someone who, who, who cared about me,\\
318 - someone who'd always stand by me through thick and thin.\\
319 - It does sound nice.\\
320 - Yeah. So does Disneyland.\\
321 - Yet every day people stagger off those giant tea cups\\
322 - covered in vomit.\\
323 - But you'd... you'd do it again?\\
324 - What can I say?\\
325 - Marriage is a great ride...\\
326 - till you puke.\\
327 - Good night.\\
328 - Good night.\\
329 - ( knocking )\\
330 - MIA: Charlie!?\\
331 - Mia?\\
332 - Your friend Rose was just at my apartment.\\
333 - Ohh...\\
334 - So, how'd that go?\\
335 - She was wearing a bridal gown.\\
336 - She's planning on wearing it to our\\
337 - wedding and she wanted me to know so we wouldn't clash.\\
338 - Well, that's kinda thoughtful, isn't it?\\
339 - I'm not finished.\\
340 - She wanted to give me a shower.\\
341 - An engagement shower?\\
342 - An actual soap- and-water shower.\\
343 - Ohh...\\
344 - I don't want her at my wedding.\\
345 - Hey, I don't want her in my zip code.\\
346 - But she's a close friend.\\
347 - Charlie.\\
348 - All right, all right, all right.\\
349 - I'll tell you what...\\
350 - I'll cross Rose off the guest list\\
351 - if you dump that pistol- packin' hermaphrodite\\
352 - you call a sister.\\
353 - She's my maid of honor, the gun is registered\\
354 - and she's taking hormones.\\
355 - While we're pruning the guest list,\\
356 - what about your mother?\\
357 - Done. She's out. Now your mother.\\
358 - It's not the same thing. You would've\\
359 - thrown your mother overboard for free.\\
360 - I don't care. If she goes,\\
361 - somebody on your side's gotta go.\\
362 - How about your father?\\
363 - He takes us all out to dinner\\
364 - and the only plastic he's got on him is his shoes.\\
365 - Charlie, he has to give me away at the wedding.\\
366 - Give you away?\\
367 - That cheapskate?\\
368 - I'll probably have to trade him a pony\\
369 - and a couple of blankets for you.\\
370 - So what are we saying?\\
371 - That we're gonna have a wedding\\
372 - that none of our family and friends can attend?\\
373 - We might as well just go\\
374 - to Vegas and elope.\\
375 - Now there's an interesting concept.\\
376 - In Vegas, not only could we get married immediately,\\
377 - we can get drunk and gamble away our nest egg.\\
378 - Don't forget the lap dances and hookers.\\
379 - Oh, you're gonna make a great wife.\\
380 - * Men...\\
381 - All the wonderful plans I had for a wedding...\\
382 - Let it go, Alan.\\
383 - I don't understand the big rush.\\
384 - You wouldn't even stop for boutonnieres.\\
385 - I just wanna get this over with.\\
386 - Get this over with?\\
387 - That's the attitude you take\\
388 - to a proctologist, not a marriage.\\
389 - Well, maybe I'm just a little nervous.\\
390 - Is that all it is?\\
391 - What are you saying?\\
392 - I'm saying that if you're feeling uneasy,\\
393 - maybe you're not ready for this.\\
394 - Did you have doubts when you got married?\\
395 - None. Judith assured me I was doing the right thing.\\
396 - KANDI: * Here comes the bride *\\
397 - * Here comes the bride\\
398 - * Here comes the bri-ide, here comes the bride. *\\
399 - That's all I got.\\
400 - Hi.\\
401 - Wow.\\
402 - You look beautiful.\\
403 - Thanks.\\
404 - I was afraid you were gonna chicken out.\\
405 - That's funny. She said the same thing about you.\\
406 - Thank you, Kandi.\\
407 - So, are you sure this is what you really want to do?\\
408 - I'm sure. Are you?\\
409 - Absolutely.\\
410 - MAN: Okay.\\
411 - Who's the lucky couple?\\
412 - Well, we're the ones getting married,\\
413 - so I guess it's them.\\
414 - Charlie.\\
415 - I joke.\\
416 - MINISTER: All righty.\\
417 - Now, before we begin the ceremony, I need\\
418 - both your signatures there and there.\\
419 - Okay.\\
420 - So, are you folks\\
421 - staying in Vegas,\\
422 - or are you honeymooning somewhere else?\\
423 - I don't know.\\
424 - What do you think, sweetie?\\
425 - Oh, uh... can I talk to you for a second?\\
426 - What'd I say? Am I in trouble already?\\
427 - I swear to God, I think we're the lucky couple.\\
428 - Charlie, relax, I just want to talk to you about our honeymoon.\\
429 - Oh. I'll take you anywhere you wanna go.\\
430 - Frankly, I'd pick a place with a nice ceiling,\\
431 - 'cause we're just gonna take turns looking at it.\\
432 - Charlie, I'd love to honeymoon with you, but,\\
433 - well, I have to work and, well, I think it'd be smarter\\
434 - to use the money to redo the house.\\
435 - Oh, I get it. You gave up trying to change me\\
436 - so now the house has to suffer?\\
437 - If we're gonna have a family,\\
438 - we'll need to turn the second bedroom into a nursery.\\
439 - But that's, that's where Jake stays.\\
440 - Yeah, but once Alan moves out\\
441 - then Jake won't be staying there anymore, right?\\
442 - Alan's moving out?\\
443 - Of course he is.\\
444 - Isn't he?\\
445 - This is so romantic.\\
446 - When I was a little girl, I used to love playing bride.\\
447 - Me, too.\\
448 - I-I mean, I mean, I was the groom.\\
449 - Most of the time.\\
450 - You think you'll ever get married again?\\
451 - I don't know. I hope so.\\
452 - You should, 'cause you'd make a good husband.\\
453 - You're kind, considerate, dependable\\
454 - and you're cuter than a duck wearing a hat.\\
455 - Come on, Charlie.\\
456 - We need our privacy.\\
457 - But they're my family.\\
458 - I can't just kick 'em out.\\
459 - Well, you could've said something before now.\\
460 - Who knew your idea of marriage\\
461 - was you and me alone in a house?\\
462 - I don't believe this.\\
463 - As long as I've known you, you've been complaining\\
464 - about Alan living with you.\\
465 - And you want to take that away from me?\\
466 - You know what? I thought you were\\
467 - ready to grow up, but clearly I was wrong.\\
468 - What's more grown up\\
469 - than wanting to take care of my family?\\
470 - And let's not forget,\\
471 - you're the one who came back to me.\\
472 - I only came back to you because I wanted your sperm.\\
473 - Yeah, well, it's a package deal.\\
474 - My sperm and my brother go hand in hand.\\
475 - Kandi, this is so sudden.\\
476 - I know.\\
477 - But lots of good things are sudden.\\
478 - Like sun showers... orgasms...\\
479 - That's two things.\\
480 - Multiple orgasms.\\
481 - That's five.\\
482 - All right, deal's off.\\
483 - Let's get the hell outta here.\\
484 - Hang on. Are you really serious about this?\\
485 - You love me, I love you, the sex is great.\\
486 - The sex is unbelievable.\\
487 - Wait, what'd you say?\\
488 - I said the wedding's off.\\
489 - Oh my God, what happened?\\
490 - It doesn't matter.\\
491 - What's important is I just avoided\\
492 - making a huge mistake.\\
493 - Charlie, I am so sorry.\\
494 - Oh, thanks.\\
495 - Now let's head for a strip joint,\\
496 - get drunk and let the healing begin.\\
497 - Uh, yeah, but, but, before we do that,\\
498 - I was wondering, uh, could I ask you for a little favor?\\
499 - Yeah?\\
500 - Can I borrow your wedding ring?\\
501 - What for?\\
502 - Well, I thought as long as we're in Vegas,\\
503 - I'd marry Kandi.\\
504 - Are you insane?\\
505 - Oh, come on, you're not using it.\\
506 - * Men...\\
507 - I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.\\
508 - I don't freakin' believe it.\\
509 - Cheer up, Charlie.\\
510 - You're finally getting what you always wanted.\\
511 - I'm moving out of your house.\\
512 - I don't freakin' believe it.
