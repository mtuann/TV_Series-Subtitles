1 - Previously on:\\
2 - So, how's Charlie doing?\\
3 - Oh, he's fine.\\
4 - Uh, actually, he's engaged.\\
5 - You told her I was engaged?\\
6 - Why the hell would you do that?!\\
7 - Charlie, there's a woman named Mia on the phone.\\
8 - (toilet flushes)\\
9 - I'll take it.\\
10 - MIA: Hi, Charlie.\\
11 - Mia.\\
12 - * Men.\\
13 - So, how are you?\\
14 - Great. How are you?\\
15 - Fine, fine.\\
16 - Still engaged.\\
17 - Come, sit, join us.\\
18 - Are you sure I'm not interrupting?\\
19 - No, no, of course not.\\
20 - Yeah, his fianc  e just left.\\
21 - Oh, I'm sorry I missed her.\\
22 - Oh, I bet she's still out in the parking lot.\\
23 - I'll go get her.\\
24 - So...\\
25 - what's going on with you these days? You still dancing?\\
26 - Not so much. I'm a little old for ballet now.\\
27 - Oh, that can't be right.\\
28 - You look great.\\
29 - Young and vibrant and... taut.\\
30 - You know who else has a great body?\\
31 - Charlie's fianc  e.\\
32 - In fact,\\
33 - Charlie calls her boobalicious.\\
34 - I'm really happy you found somebody, Charlie.\\
35 - Thank you. She's great.\\
36 - Really, really great.\\
37 - Boobalicious.\\
38 - So if you're not dancing, what are you up to?\\
39 - Well, believe it or not, I'm trying for a singing career.\\
40 - No kidding. That's terrific.\\
41 - You know who's a wonderful singer?\\
42 - Charlie's fianc  e?\\
43 - Uh, actually, I was gonna say Ms. Celine Dion.\\
44 - I have no idea about Chelsea.\\
45 - Although she does have a set of lungs on her.\\
46 - Right.\\
47 - So listen, I'm putting together a demo of some songs.\\
48 - Any chance you could help me with the arrangements,\\
49 - maybe play piano?\\
50 - Oh, wow.\\
51 - That sounds like fun.\\
52 - It's just, you know, kind of awkward 'cause, you know...\\
53 - He's getting married.\\
54 - Maybe I can find you somebody else.\\
55 - That'd be terrific. Let me give you my number.\\
56 - Are you still at 696-336-725?\\
57 - Yeah, I can't believe you remember it.\\
58 - Well, I have a little memory trick.\\
59 - If you change the numbers to letters,\\
60 - it spells out "oxofempal."\\
61 - Oh, good trick.\\
62 - I should get going.\\
63 - Wonderful to see you again.\\
64 - Same here.\\
65 - You too, Alan.\\
66 - Bye-bye.\\
67 - Charlie?\\
68 - Yeah?\\
69 - I've missed you.\\
70 - Oxofempal?\\
71 - Hot, hot, hot! Ow!\\
72 - You have to dial one first.\\
73 - Captioning sponsored by CBS\\
74 - WARNER BROS. TELEVISION\\
75 - and VOLKSWAGEN. It's what the people want.\\
76 - * Men...\\
77 - Hey, Berta, what do you know about Percocet?\\
78 - I know three of them with a Mickey's big mouth\\
79 - can make you run buck naked through a Taco Bell.\\
80 - Why do you ask?\\
81 - Well, my mom says Grandma Lenore can't hold the new baby\\
82 - until she stops popping them.\\
83 - That's probably a good idea.\\
84 - You drop one kid, you gain a reputation as a kid dropper.\\
85 - So how do you like having a new baby sister?\\
86 - Well, she eats, she sleeps, she poops.\\
87 - So far I'm not impressed.\\
88 - Give her a bad haircut and she'd be you.\\
89 - Excuse me, but I paid nine bucks for this haircut.\\
90 - Sorry.\\
91 - Besides, the baby doesn't look anything like me.\\
92 - In fact, she doesn't look like my mom or my stepdad either.\\
93 - Who does she look like?\\
94 - Kind of like a girl version of my dad.\\
95 - I thought your dad was the girl version of your dad.\\
96 - I'm telling you, Charlie, it's a bad idea.\\
97 - What's the big deal?\\
98 - I'm just gonna find her a piano player.\\
99 - Oh, come on, I saw the way you looked at her.\\
100 - You say "piano player," but you mean organist.\\
101 - Oh, that's ridiculous.\\
102 - I'm engaged to Chelsea.\\
103 - I'm living with Chelsea.\\
104 - I'm in love with Chelsea.\\
105 - What's Chelsea's phone number?\\
106 - What?\\
107 - What does it spell?\\
108 - You know, your little memory trick.\\
109 - Oh, uh...\\
110 - it's... jklpuzo.\\
111 - Really?\\
112 - Let's, uh, let's test it out.\\
113 - Uh, is that, uh, 818-jklpuzo\\
114 - or, uh, 310-jklpuzo?\\
115 - All right, all right, I-I made it up.\\
116 - But I don't have to call Chelsea; she lives here.\\
117 - You don't have to call Mia either.\\
118 - Oh, yeah?\\
119 - Well, what about you and Melissa?\\
120 - What does that have to do with anything? Nothing!\\
121 - I'm changing the subject to your peccadilloes.\\
122 - You were banging Melissa in the hospital storage closet\\
123 - while your ex-wife was giving birth to your daughter!\\
124 - We don't know she's my daughter.\\
125 - Who's your daughter?\\
126 - You're my daughter, I'm your daughter!\\
127 - This whole court is out of daughter!\\
128 - Al Pacino?\\
129 - Great movie.\\
130 - Hoo-ah!\\
131 - See that one?\\
132 - That was close.\\
133 - Good thing he's slow.\\
134 - Yeah, well, Judith's mom dropped him when he was a baby.\\
135 - * Men.\\
136 - (both panting)\\
137 - Wow.\\
138 - Yeah.\\
139 - What brought that on?\\
140 - You're the one who started talking dirty.\\
141 - All I said is, "What'd you do today?"\\
142 - There you go again, you nasty girl.\\
143 - Okay, seriously, what did you do today?\\
144 - Nothing.\\
145 - Just a regular day.\\
146 - Had coffee with you, hung out with Alan a little bit,\\
147 - then came home, had a drink, took a nap,\\
148 - next thing I know you're walking in\\
149 - the front door with your whore talk.\\
150 - All right, whatever.\\
151 - Oh, yeah, there was one other thing.\\
152 - Really?\\
153 - Yeah, I ran into an old buddy.\\
154 - What's her name?\\
155 - Her?\\
156 - Why do you assume it's a her?\\
157 - When you've seen one of your old guy friends,\\
158 - you don't try to hump me into a coma.\\
159 - Fair point.\\
160 - It was Mia.\\
161 - Mia, the old buddy you almost married?\\
162 - Yeah.\\
163 - And?\\
164 - And nothing.\\
165 - Well, she did ask me if\\
166 - I'd help her out with this music thing she's doing.\\
167 - But I said no. How come?\\
168 - I thought it'd be inappropriate.\\
169 - Why? You still have feelings for her?\\
170 - (chuckles)\\
171 - No, no, of course not.\\
172 - Then why wouldn't you help her out?\\
173 - What?\\
174 - I mean, if she's just a friend,\\
175 - then why would it be inappropriate?\\
176 - Okay.\\
177 - Uh, no reason.\\
178 - So you're saying I should help her out?\\
179 - Unless you still have feelings for her.\\
180 - I guess I'll help her.\\
181 - Good.\\
182 - Good.\\
183 - Or bad.\\
184 - Probably bad.\\
185 - I'm gonna go with bad.\\
186 - * Men.\\
187 - Hi, Charlie!\\
188 - We were just having a little\\
189 - moonlight skinny dip in the ocean.\\
190 - Good thinking.\\
191 - Nothing more romantic than seaweed\\
192 - hanging from a cold, shriveled penis.\\
193 - There's no seaweed--\\
194 - Oh, my...\\
195 - Don't put it on the table!\\
196 - Sorry.\\
197 - Alan, what do you say we take a hot shower\\
198 - and un-shrink the Snuffleupagus? (chuckles)\\
199 - He'll be fine.\\
200 - It's Bert and Ernie I'm worried about.\\
201 - I think Bert has ascended to my rib cage.\\
202 - You go ahead. I'll be right there.\\
203 - Okey-doke. Okay.\\
204 - Hey, uh, can I ask you something?\\
205 - I am not gonna help you find your missing testicle.\\
206 - No, no, it's about Melissa.\\
207 - What about her?\\
208 - Well, now that we're seeing each other again,\\
209 - the fact that she still lives with her mom\\
210 - presents kind of a problem.\\
211 - Why?\\
212 - 'Cause you tickled mom's Elmo?\\
213 - It was just light necking.\\
214 - I never touched her Elmo.\\
215 - Anyway,\\
216 - since you set the precedent\\
217 - of having girlfriends move in here,\\
218 - uh, I was wondering if maybe...\\
219 - No.\\
220 - Why not?\\
221 - You let Chelsea move in.\\
222 - It's my house.\\
223 - You are a guest.\\
224 - And by "guest," I mean leech I tolerate until our mother dies\\
225 - and she can't lay a guilt trip on me\\
226 - for kicking your ass to the curb.\\
227 - You're gonna kick me out when Mom dies?\\
228 - You're planning on being here until Mom dies?\\
229 - Okay, okay, we're getting off subject.\\
230 - What about Jake? You let Jake move in.\\
231 - You're not helping your case here, Alan.\\
232 - But I'm just saying...\\
233 - I said no!\\
234 - Hmm. Hey, Bert, welcome back.\\
235 - * Men.\\
236 - (playing "You'll Never Find")\\
237 - * You'll never find *\\
238 - * As long as you live *\\
239 - * Someone who loves you *\\
240 - * Tender like I do\\
241 - * You'll never find *\\
242 - * No matter where you search *\\
243 - (voice cracks): * Someone who cares about you *\\
244 - * The way I do\\
245 - * Whoa, I'm not bragging on myself, baby *\\
246 - * 'Cause I'm the one who loves you *\\
247 - (off-key): * And there's no one else *\\
248 - * No... one else.\\
249 - That's a pretty mouth, but it ain't made for singing.\\
250 - What's it made for?\\
251 - Eating.\\
252 - Oh.\\
253 - I thought maybe she meant oral sex.\\
254 - (off-key): * You're gonna miss my lovin' *\\
255 - * You're gonna miss, miss, miss my love. *\\
256 - (piano stops)\\
257 - So?\\
258 - Wow.\\
259 - You want to run it again? I don't.\\
260 - I mean, there's a danger of over-rehearsing it.\\
261 - Yeah. Plus I kind of nailed it, right?\\
262 - I don't see it getting any better.\\
263 - That is so sweet, Charlie.\\
264 - Thank you.\\
265 - I don't know how I'd do this without you.\\
266 - Hey, I don't deserve any credit.\\
267 - God gave you that voice.\\
268 - I had nothing to do with it.\\
269 - Oh, hello.\\
270 - Oh, hey, hi!\\
271 - There she is!\\
272 - Chelsea, this is Mia. Mia, this is Chelsea.\\
273 - Hi. Hi!\\
274 - We were just rehearsing.\\
275 - Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.\\
276 - What? No-no, no, there's nothing to interrupt.\\
277 - She's singing, I'm playing piano,\\
278 - Alan, Berta and Jake are right there in the kitchen.\\
279 - Guys, Chelsea's home.\\
280 - ALL (flatly): Yay.\\
281 - I should get going. Good.\\
282 - I mean, you don't have to, but good.\\
283 - Rehearsal was good.\\
284 - You've got yourself a terrific guy here.\\
285 - I know. Nice to meet you.\\
286 - Nice to meet you, too.\\
287 - I'll see you Saturday at the studio?\\
288 - You bet.\\
289 - * You'll never find... *\\
290 - No, no, save your voice.\\
291 - Yikes.\\
292 - So, how'd it go?\\
293 - Well, uh, how can I put this?\\
294 - She's the picture you stick on the cover\\
295 - of an album by a fat girl who can actually sing.\\
296 - That's not what I mean.\\
297 - Were there any, you know, sparks?\\
298 - No, no sparks.\\
299 - Why would there be sparks?\\
300 - I'm with you. We're engaged.\\
301 - We're gonna be married.\\
302 - You and me, that's the sparks...\\
303 - baby.\\
304 - Relax, Charlie, I trust you.\\
305 - Okay, lady, you're really starting to piss me off.\\
306 - * Men.\\
307 - No problem, Charlie, as long as you're willing\\
308 - to pay my weekend rates.\\
309 - You've got weekend rates?\\
310 - Yep, and you probably don't want to waste time haggling.\\
311 - Now, what's the big emergency?\\
312 - Well, you might not think it's a big emergency,\\
313 - but trust me, it is.\\
314 - Okay.\\
315 - I'm really constipated.\\
316 - You do realize which end of the body I specialize in?\\
317 - I know, I know, I'm not here for an enema.\\
318 - Good, because that couch isn't Scotchguarded.\\
319 - I'm thinking it's psychosomatic 'cause I've tried coffee,\\
320 - fiber, laxatives and something my housekeeper said was\\
321 - a suppository, but I now suspect was a practical joke.\\
322 - All right, so psychosomatic constipation.\\
323 - Good name for rock band, huh?\\
324 - Weekend rates, Charlie.\\
325 - Tell me what's going on in your life.\\
326 - How are things with you and your fianc  ?\\
327 - Great, great! She lives with me now.\\
328 - We're planning the wedding. Couldn't be better.\\
329 - Good. And how's work?\\
330 - Well, it's been pretty slow,\\
331 - but thankfully, the house is paid off,\\
332 - my pension is funded, and I've given up prostitutes.\\
333 - So, really, all I need is drinking money,\\
334 - and what's that, a couple grand a month?\\
335 - That sounds about right.\\
336 - Hey, do you remember Mia?\\
337 - Your ex-fianc   the dancer.\\
338 - Wow, you remember.\\
339 - I'm not sitting here sketching ponies, Charlie.\\
340 - Anyway, I ran into her.\\
341 - Really? And how'd that go?\\
342 - Fine, fine. She looks great,\\
343 - she's single again, told me she missed me.\\
344 - Uh-huh.\\
345 - I always dig that.\\
346 - Then she asked me if I could help her out\\
347 - with this music project, and I said no.\\
348 - But then Chelsea said\\
349 - if I didn't still have feelings for her, why not do it?\\
350 - So I did it.\\
351 - Interesting.\\
352 - When did all this happen?\\
353 - Three of four days ago.\\
354 - And how long have you been constipated?\\
355 - I don't know. Three, four days.\\
356 - Hey, you think there's a connection?\\
357 - I'm leaning that way.\\
358 - Look, Charlie,\\
359 - you obviously still have feelings for Mia,\\
360 - and yet you're committed to Chelsea.\\
361 - It's an emotional conflict,\\
362 - and until you resolve that conflict,\\
363 - you're going to be physically blocked.\\
364 - English, please?\\
365 - As soon as you pick one, you can go two.\\
366 - What happens if I can't pick?\\
367 - I don't know. C-section?\\
368 - * Men.\\
369 - Anyway, she said I have to resolve the conflict\\
370 - because my emotions are strongly connected\\
371 - to my lower intestine.\\
372 - That makes a certain amount of sense.\\
373 - You think with your penis, and your head's up your ass.\\
374 - (gasps) The baby just came!\\
375 - Baby?\\
376 - Well, it's not technically a baby,\\
377 - but we know it's gonna look like you.\\
378 - Hey, Charlie\\
379 - Hey.\\
380 - What's she still doing here?\\
381 - Not still. She went away, she came back.\\
382 - She's not moving in, Alan.\\
383 - Of course not. You said no, it's no.\\
384 - We're out of milk, sweetie.\\
385 - I'm gonna run to the market.\\
386 - Okay.\\
387 - She likes milk.\\
388 - So how are you gonna resolve your conflict?\\
389 - I'm not sure.\\
390 - I may have to sleep with Mia.\\
391 - What?!\\
392 - Okay, here's the deal.\\
393 - (groans)\\
394 - If I back out of the recording session with Mia,\\
395 - Chelsea will think I still have feelings for her.\\
396 - All right.\\
397 - However, if I spend\\
398 - any more time with Mia without sleeping with her,\\
399 - I'm gonna split open like a roasted pistachio.\\
400 - Nobody wants that!\\
401 - Charlie, cheating on Chelsea makes\\
402 - absolutely no sense whatsoever.\\
403 - That's what I thought,\\
404 - but my shrink was pretty adamant.\\
405 - Just promise if anything happens to me,\\
406 - you'll raise it as your own.\\
407 - * Men.\\
408 - (funky R&B playing)\\
409 - (off-key): * Down in Louisiana\\
410 - * Where the alligators grow so mean *\\
411 - * Lived a girl that I swear to the world *\\
412 - * Made the alligators look tame *\\
413 - * Poke salad Annie\\
414 - I know, I know it's hard to believe\\
415 - I'm not banging her.\\
416 - Then why are we here?\\
417 - She's an old friend. I'm helping her out.\\
418 - You really want to help her out?\\
419 - Sneak up behind her with a big rock.\\
420 - (groaning)\\
421 - Detox?\\
422 - No, constipated.\\
423 - 'Cause you're detoxing?\\
424 - Can we just do this?\\
425 - Fine.\\
426 - (volume increases)\\
427 - * 'Cause your mama was working on the chain gang *\\
428 - * Poke\\
429 - * Salad.\\
430 - (song ends)\\
431 - (sighs) That one felt really good.\\
432 - Okay, help me understand something.\\
433 - You're hoping to bang her, right?\\
434 - Can I hear a little?\\
435 - Sure. Play it back.\\
436 - * Down in Louisiana\\
437 - That's me?\\
438 - That's you.\\
439 - * Where the alligators grow so mean *\\
440 - Wow. I had no idea I was so good.\\
441 - Oh, Charlie, I'm so happy!\\
442 - Oh, well, if you're happy, I'm happy.\\
443 - Why did I ever let you go?\\
444 - If I recall, you had a list of reasons.\\
445 - Well, I was wrong.\\
446 - How can I make it up to you?\\
447 - Um, how do you want to make it up to me?\\
448 - Wow.\\
449 - There it is.\\
450 - Let's do this last track, and then we can go back to my place.\\
451 - (door closes)\\
452 - Maybe we can sweeten her vocals with some reverb,\\
453 - a little echo, lay a little guitar over it?\\
454 - We can lay car horns and barking dogs over it.\\
455 - It won't help.\\
456 - I'm ready.\\
457 - Just relax and feel the groove, okay?\\
458 - I got it.\\
459 - Okay, this is "Boogie-woogie Bugle Boy."\\
460 - Take one.\\
461 - (trumpets play intro)\\
462 - (off-key): * He was a famous trumpet man *\\
463 - * From out Chicago way\\
464 - * He had a boogie style that no one else could play, whoo! *\\
465 - * He was the top man at his craft *\\
466 - * And then his number came up, and he was going to the draft *\\
467 - * He's in the army now, blowing reveille *\\
468 - * He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B *\\
469 - Okay, Mia, hold it,\\
470 - hold it a sec.\\
471 - Is something wrong?\\
472 - Yeah, kind of. You can't sing.\\
473 - What?\\
474 - You got no talent.\\
475 - I'm sorry, but we're both wasting our time here.\\
476 - I love Chelsea.\\
477 - I'm gonna marry her, and I can't see you anymore.\\
478 - Are you kidding?\\
479 - You can't just walk out on me! You...\\
480 - Where's the bathroom?\\
481 - Down the hall.\\
482 - Thanks.\\
483 - No,thank you.\\
484 - I should have known this would happen,\\
485 - you lowlife son of a bitch!\\
486 - Uh, the lowlife son of a bitch is gone,\\
487 - but I think you have a real gift,\\
488 - and we should work together.\\
489 - Oh, you gotta be kidding me.\\
490 - You might want to give it a minute.\\
491 - You were in there with your guitar?\\
492 - You never know when inspiration might strike.\\
493 - That's called "Two Burritos and a Root Beer Float."\\
494 - * Men.\\
495 - * Men.\\
496 - Hey, how's the intestines?\\
497 - Clean as a whistle.\\
498 - It's the city's problem now.\\
499 - (laughs)\\
500 - Yeah, ha-ha, very funny.\\
501 - What was in that so-called suppository you gave me, anyway?\\
502 - Half a tab of Alka-Seltzer crushed up in a gel cap.\\
503 - Oh. Well, that explains the foam.\\
504 - Well, I'm off to work.\\
505 - Oh, have a good day, sweetie.\\
506 - I'll be home around 6:30. Okay.\\
507 - Alan?\\
508 - She's not living here.\\
509 - Just checking.\\
510 - And he calls me stupid.
\subsection {Episode 02: Whipped Unto the Third Generation}
1 - * Men. *\\
2 - Hey, Danny.\\
3 - Good morning, Melissa.\\
4 - You look lovely today.\\
5 - Thank you, Danny.\\
6 - I think he's got a little thing for you.\\
7 - No, you've got a little thing for her.\\
8 - I've got a croquet mallet in my pants.\\
9 - Danny, behave yourself.\\
10 - Alan, I thought I told you to keep that doll in your room.\\
11 - Come on.\\
12 - He's got to feed the broad sometime.\\
13 - See what I did there?\\
14 - You're so clever.\\
15 - How about spaghetti with pesto for dinner tonight?\\
16 - Oh, boy, with the pine nuts? You got it.\\
17 - I've got your pine nuts right here.\\
18 - Danny.\\
19 - Buy one, get one free.\\
20 - Okay, Alan, I'm only going to ask you this once.\\
21 - Has little Miss Muppet moved into my house?\\
22 - What? No. Huh-uh.\\
23 - Really?\\
24 - and still here when I get up.\\
25 - Well, to be fair, Charlie,\\
26 - you do have an erratic sleep schedule.\\
27 - So you're saying I continually miss it when she goes home?\\
28 - Charlie, you missed Easter last year.\\
29 - Was that the time I woke up\\
30 - with a Cadbury egg melted in my shorts?\\
31 - Sadly enough, no.\\
32 - Okay, okay, just so you understand\\
33 - this is my house and you don't get to invite people to move in.\\
34 - Why do you keep harping on that?\\
35 - She is not living here.\\
36 - I'm just going to throw in a load of laundry\\
37 - before I go to work.\\
38 - Sure looks like she is.\\
39 - I don't know what he's talking about.\\
40 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
41 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
42 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
43 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
44 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
45 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
46 - * Men. *\\
47 - Hey, listen, I was thinking.\\
48 - We've already got a bed.\\
49 - And you're the one who's always complaining about it.\\
50 - Oh, I complain about a lot of things.\\
51 - Like, uh, like automatic flush toilets.\\
52 - I mean, everything's gone before you get a chance\\
53 - to turn around and check out how you did.\\
54 - What the dickens are you talking about?\\
55 - Let's just leave the furniture the way it is.\\
56 - I don't want to rock the boat.\\
57 - How is getting a decent bed\\
58 - rocking the boat?\\
59 - And-and no. I mean...\\
60 - It's still Charlie's house.\\
61 - But you pay rent? Of course.\\
62 - I mean, you know, the actual number fluctuates\\
63 - depending on the economy and whether Charlie's conscious\\
64 - on the first of the month. But yeah, I pay.\\
65 - Okay, then you need to start standing up to him.\\
66 - Oh, please.\\
67 - I stand up to him plenty. Is that so?\\
68 - You think he likes unsalted butter?\\
69 - He does not.\\
70 - Now you listen to me, Alan Harper.\\
71 - You are a strong, assertive man.\\
72 - I know that because I couldn't be with you\\
73 - if you were anything less.\\
74 - Oh, well, yeah, I am.\\
75 - You know, I... I don't want to flaunt\\
76 - my strong assertiveness by, you know, asking for stuff.\\
77 - Alan, you need to tell your brother\\
78 - well, then that is just his tough noogies.\\
79 - Okay, I will tell him.\\
80 - Good. But slowly.\\
81 - In increments.\\
82 - As I did with the butter.\\
83 - And how long did that take?\\
84 - That is not important.\\
85 - What's important is this is now\\
86 - a low sodium, heart smart household.\\
87 - She's living here.\\
88 - He moved her in right under my nose.\\
89 - So?\\
90 - So this is the unsalted butter again,\\
91 - but, you know, writ large.\\
92 - "What difference?"\\
93 - Are you kidding?\\
94 - First it's him and his stinky kid\\
95 - and now he's shacking up with Strawberry Shortcake!\\
96 - He pays rent, doesn't he?\\
97 - I don't know.\\
98 - Once, maybe.\\
99 - He says he did.\\
100 - So why do you care who he has in his room?\\
101 - I care because...\\
102 - There's a principle involved.\\
103 - "A principle"?\\
104 - Yes! I made a rule.\\
105 - Ooh, you made a rule.\\
106 - Yes, I made a rule.\\
107 - And I'm making another one.\\
108 - You do not get to mock my rules.\\
109 - You're being silly, Charlie.\\
110 - Melissa is a wonderful girl.\\
111 - They love each other and she makes him happy.\\
112 - And I care about that because...?\\
113 - Because the Charlie Harper that I fell in love with\\
114 - cares about other people's happiness.\\
115 - That's the Charlie Harper you fell in love with, huh? Yes.\\
116 - Well, joke's on you.\\
117 - That whole nice guy thing was a big act\\
118 - to get you to have sex with me.\\
119 - Ha-ha.\\
120 - I know you'll do the right thing, Charlie.\\
121 - Oh, you do, huh?\\
122 - * Men. *\\
123 - Hey.\\
124 - Hey. Got a minute?\\
125 - I'm reading.\\
126 - Okay, we'll talk later.\\
127 - (door opens and closes)\\
128 - (muffled arguing)\\
129 - MELISSA (muffled): Damn it, Alan, get back out there!\\
130 - (door opens and closes)\\
131 - Hey-ho.\\
132 - What do you want, Alan? Well...\\
133 - as you know, I pay my fair share of rent around here.\\
134 - We probably have different definitions of "fair."\\
135 - And "share."\\
136 - And "rent," but go on.\\
137 - I-I-I just don't think I need your permission\\
138 - when it comes to Melissa living with me.\\
139 - Well, you're wrong. Nice talking to you.\\
140 - Charlie.\\
141 - This is my house.\\
142 - Not yours, mine.\\
143 - And the fact is, if Melissa moves in,\\
144 - that means you've got more people living here than I do.\\
145 - So?\\
146 - So there's a principle involved...\\
147 - ...that we must discuss.\\
148 - Okay, so what's the principle?\\
149 - The principle is that...\\
150 - you're my brother and I want you to be happy.\\
151 - So Melissa can stay?\\
152 - I mean, move in?\\
153 - Sure.\\
154 - Well, all right then.\\
155 - (exclaims)\\
156 - * Men. *\\
157 - You know, I was thinking.\\
158 - You've got me. Alan's got Melissa.\\
159 - Even Jake's got a girlfriend.\\
160 - We need to find somebody for Sir Lancelot.\\
161 - Your cat?\\
162 - Yeah. Doesn't he deserve some happiness?\\
163 - He can lick his own crotch. What else does he need?\\
164 - Come on, Charlie.\\
165 - All right.\\
166 - How about we get him a nice lady coyote?\\
167 - Charlie!\\
168 - What? It'd be good for ol' Lance.\\
169 - Get a little exercise running for his life.\\
170 - You're terrible.\\
171 - (phone ringing)\\
172 - Let the machine get it.\\
173 - ALAN: (on recording) Hi, this is Alan.\\
174 - We're not home right now and neither are Charlie and Chelsea.\\
175 - Well, Charlie might be home, but he's probably\\
176 - in no condition to answer the phone.\\
177 - (Alan and Melissa laughing)\\
178 - BOTH: Leave a message when you hear the beep.\\
179 - Beep!\\
180 - (machine beeps)\\
181 - EVELYN (on machine): Hello, Charlie?\\
182 - It's your mother.\\
183 - Remember me?\\
184 - for roughly seven and a half months.\\
185 - Anyway, I'd say call me, but what's the point?\\
186 - I've long since given up expecting\\
187 - any kind of consideration... (machine beeps)\\
188 - "Seven and a half months"?\\
189 - he wouldn't have invented C-sections and incubators."\\
190 - Oh, hey, all.\\
191 - We're home.\\
192 - (sotto voce): Charlie?\\
193 - Hi.\\
194 - Oh, uh, just so you know,\\
195 - and you guys can take the top and we'll split the door, okay?\\
196 - That's a great idea.\\
197 - Be quiet.\\
198 - I bought it. I paid for it.\\
199 - Charlie! The whole thing, not just half.\\
200 - Stop being a child.\\
201 - a grape soda just because I put it on the wrong shelf!\\
202 - Mind if we join you guys? Sure.\\
203 - What are we watching? (The Odd Couple theme plays)\\
204 - An Odd Couple rerun.\\
205 - Oh, I never really liked that show.\\
206 - Why not? I don't really buy the premise.\\
207 - I mean, you know, who in his right mind would put up with somebody\\
208 - who drives him crazy for all those years?\\
209 - I mean, it would be different if they were related.\\
210 - * Men. *\\
211 - Oh, yeah. Barrel of monkeys.\\
212 - I'm so excited about that big punch bowl.\\
213 - You know what would be really exciting?\\
214 - Next time you ask me to go shopping with you,\\
215 - use it to cave in my skull.\\
216 - (surfing music plays)\\
217 - What the hell is this?\\
218 - Oh, look who's here.\\
219 - Hey, dude, party down.\\
220 - What are you doing?\\
221 - We invited a few friends over.\\
222 - You don't have any friends.\\
223 - Yeah, but Melissa does.\\
224 - So now they're mine, too.\\
225 - They don't really like you.\\
226 - They do, too.\\
227 - Dream on, meat puppet.\\
228 - Who said you could have a party?\\
229 - I'm sorry. I thought we lived here.\\
230 - Must we check with you about everything we do?\\
231 - Yes!\\
232 - What's that guy drinking?\\
233 - Is that my grape soda?\\
234 - It was on our shelf.\\
235 - What'd I tell ya?\\
236 - Okay, that's it. Charlie...\\
237 - No-no-no. No, no, this is not acceptable.\\
238 - Hey, everybody!\\
239 - Everybody listen up.\\
240 - (music stops)\\
241 - Party's over.\\
242 - Pack up your crap and get out.\\
243 - I'm not kidding!\\
244 - One.\\
245 - I'm counting to three, by the way.\\
246 - Two.\\
247 - Ah, screw it.\\
248 - I'll leave.\\
249 - Charlie.\\
250 - Forget it. I'm out of here.\\
251 - (crowd chatter)\\
252 - * Men.\\
253 - * Men.\\
254 - Okay, I think you're really overreacting,\\
255 - but if you want to spend the night at a hotel, fine.\\
256 - No, I will not come over there for a quickie.\\
257 - Good-bye, Charlie.\\
258 - He just needs to cool off.\\
259 - We're really sorry, Chelsea.\\
260 - before inviting our friends over.\\
261 - Your friends?\\
262 - Maybe we just need some kind of system\\
263 - where we give each other a heads up about guests.\\
264 - That's a great idea.\\
265 - Excuse me.\\
266 - Since when do you two call the shots around here?\\
267 - What are you talking about?\\
268 - (scoffs)\\
269 - All right, ladies,\\
270 - let's make something very clear.\\
271 - that needs to be honored.\\
272 - Oh, really?\\
273 - And what might that be?\\
274 - Wow.\\
275 - (laughs)\\
276 - Do I have to spell it out?\\
277 - Please do.\\
278 - Fine.\\
279 - When Charlie is not here, I am in charge.\\
280 - That's okay, isn't it?\\
281 - * Men.\\
282 - (indistinct voices on TV)\\
283 - (knocking)\\
284 - Yeah?\\
285 - ALAN (in goofy voice): Room service.\\
286 - Guess who got himself kicked out of the house.\\
287 - Ow! Ow!\\
288 - Cut it out! Cut it out!\\
289 - What are you doing here, Alan?\\
290 - Honestly, I didn't have any place else to go.\\
291 - Yeah, well, I got news for you. You still don't.\\
292 - Oh, come on, Charlie.\\
293 - I know, I know. I might have crossed a bit of a line.\\
294 - A bit of a line?\\
295 - You moved your girlfriend into my house without telling me.\\
296 - You invited strangers over without my permission.\\
297 - And then, then, to add insult to injury,\\
298 - you show up here with your ugly friggin' dummy?!\\
299 - Did you hear that?\\
300 - He called you ugly.\\
301 - Good-bye, Alan.\\
302 - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
303 - I...\\
304 - I brought a peace offering.\\
305 - That's my ten-year-old Scotch!\\
306 - No, it's not.\\
307 - Yes, it is.\\
308 - I saw him take it. Oh!\\
309 - Damn it, Danny, what is wrong with you?\\
310 - What's wrong with me?\\
311 - All right, all right, enough. Enough.\\
312 - If I'm gonna drink scotch,\\
313 - I'm gonna need ice.\\
314 - There's a machine down the hall.\\
315 - Be right back.\\
316 - Yeah, like I don't have ice.\\
317 - * Men. *\\
318 - Thanks for letting me back in.\\
319 - You were crying in the hallway.\\
320 - The other guests complained.\\
321 - Still, it's very considerate of you.\\
322 - Shut up and drink my scotch.\\
323 - Cheers.\\
324 - Bite me.\\
325 - This is kind of fun, though.\\
326 - Swell.\\
327 - Remember that time Mom took us on that Caribbean cruise?\\
328 - We had our own cabin.\\
329 - Yeah.\\
330 - Took us three days to figure out Mom was on another boat.\\
331 - Good times. Mmm.\\
332 - We've lost our house, Charlie.\\
333 - Your house.\\
334 - We've lost your house.\\
335 - I know.\\
336 - How did this happen?\\
337 - Slowly.\\
338 - In increments.\\
339 - Starting with the butter.\\
340 - I can see that now.\\
341 - The problem is, the women have established a beachhead.\\
342 - (chuckling)\\
343 - What?\\
344 - Nothing. Nothing.\\
345 - You just reminded me why I bought a house in Malibu.\\
346 - The thing is,\\
347 - I don't mind that.\\
348 - No, no, we need a plan.\\
349 - We need to figure out some way\\
350 - to drive a wedge between those two.\\
351 - You know, divide and conquer.\\
352 - Oh, yeah, but how?\\
353 - I'm not sure.\\
354 - Maybe we should sleep on it.\\
355 - Want to watch some porn first?\\
356 - No.\\
357 - Why not?\\
358 - I'm drunk in bed in a hotel room with my brother,\\
359 - and you want to know why I don't want to watch porn?\\
360 - Okay. Okay, I get it.\\
361 - You don't want to watch porn.\\
362 - Mind if I watch?\\
363 - (Danny screaming)\\
364 - * Men. *\\
365 - So they both just up and left, huh?\\
366 - Yeah. Uh-huh.\\
367 - Those boneless chickens.\\
368 - They'll be back.\\
369 - Damn right.\\
370 - Girl power, my bitches.\\
371 - Hey, Berta, why don't you whip us up\\
372 - some French toast to celebrate?\\
373 - Or, uh, we could do it.\\
374 - Good plan...\\
375 - my bitches.\\
376 - (door closes) EVELYN: Hello, anybody home?\\
377 - In here.\\
378 - Oh, what a nice surprise.\\
379 - Good morning, ladies.\\
380 - Berta.\\
381 - Botox.\\
382 - So where are the boys this morning?\\
383 - Oh, well, Charlie's off sulking in a hotel.\\
384 - Oh, really?\\
385 - Well, what about Alan?\\
386 - Oh, Alan's too cheap for a hotel.\\
387 - I see. And what brought this on?\\
388 - A lot of macho nonsense.\\
389 - Mm, and Alan?\\
390 - Just nonsense.\\
391 - No kidding.\\
392 - Thank you. Thank you.\\
393 - have managed to put aside your somewhat distasteful history\\
394 - and bond the way you obviously have.\\
395 - What distasteful history?\\
396 - Oh, come on, let them make my breakfast first.\\
397 - What are you talking about, Evelyn?\\
398 - A lot of women might resent the former lover of their fianc  \\
399 - living in the same house as them.\\
400 - It ain't me, start cooking.\\
401 - You and Charlie?\\
402 - Just one little weekend.\\
403 - But believe me, if I knew what kind of man he was,\\
404 - I never would have let him touch me.\\
405 - What's that supposed to mean?\\
406 - Oh, he's fine for you.\\
407 - Fine for me?!\\
408 - Well, I've got an early meeting.\\
409 - Nice to see you girls.\\
410 - Why didn't you tell me?!\\
411 - I thought you were my friend!\\
412 - MELISSA: I'm your friend?!\\
413 - (arguing continues)\\
414 - CHELSEA: Hey, if it weren't for me,\\
415 - I believe the balance of power is restored.\\
416 - Thanks, Mom.\\
417 - Thank you.\\
418 - You owe me large.\\
419 - * Men. *\\
420 - * Men. *\\
421 - but if you want to spend the night in a hotel\\
422 - that's fine.\\
423 - Kidding. Love you.\\
424 - Damn.\\
425 - Hey, at least Chelsea's coming back.\\
426 - Melissa said she'll never set foot in this house again.\\
427 - All's well that ends well, huh?\\
428 - Bite me.\\
429 - Oh, come on, the important thing is, we got the house back.\\
430 - And we're once again kings of the castle.\\
431 - That's true.\\
432 - Hey, Celeste and I are going to be\\
433 - studying in my room. Okay.\\
434 - Oh, right.\\
435 - Set another place for dinner.\\
436 - She's going to be joining us.\\
437 - Fine.\\
438 - Also, she's a vegetarian, so no meat.\\
439 - Got it.\\
440 - Come on, Jake.\\
441 - Coming.\\
442 - Kings of the castle, my ass.\\
443 - We're whipped unto the third generation.
\subsection {Episode 03: Mmm, Fish. Yum.}
1 - * Men. (doorbell rings)\\
2 - JUDITH: I said, "No!"\\
3 - JAKE: And I said, "Why not?"\\
4 - No! Why not?\\
5 - I don't have to give you a reason. Dad, I got my learner's permit\\
6 - but Mom won't let me drive her car.\\
7 - Just because they give 15-year-olds learner's permits,\\
8 - doesn't mean they're ready to drive.\\
9 - Oh, please, I've been driving for years.\\
10 - Grand Theft Auto One, Grand Theft Auto Two.\\
11 - And I never ran over anybody but pimps and crack whores.\\
12 - Jake.\\
13 - Sorry. Crack prostitutes.\\
14 - Go get started on your homework.\\
15 - Afterward, will you take me driving?\\
16 - We'll talk about it later.\\
17 - When? Just go to your room.\\
18 - I'm available now.\\
19 - Go!\\
20 - Man, if I knew how to hot-wire a real car,\\
21 - I'd so be outta here.\\
22 - Well, thanks for bringing him by, I guess.\\
23 - Yeah. Uh, if you need to reach me,\\
24 - Herb and I are going to Laguna Beach for a weekend getaway.\\
25 - Oh, how nice. Taking the baby?\\
26 - Are you insane? I said "getaway."\\
27 - Herb's lucky I'm taking him.\\
28 - I see.\\
29 - So, uh, so, who's watching little Millie?\\
30 - My mother.\\
31 - Ooh. Are we sure that's a good idea?\\
32 - Okay, first of all, there is no "we" here.\\
33 - And what are you implying?\\
34 - I'm implying that there might be better choices for a babysitter\\
35 - than a woman who has a sandwich named after her\\
36 - at the Betty Ford Clinic.\\
37 - She's three years clean and sober,\\
38 - all the charges were dropped and she's great with Millie.\\
39 - All right. All right.\\
40 - I hope you don't mind, but I gave her your number\\
41 - in case there's an emergency.\\
42 - I don't mind.\\
43 - So, uh, how is the baby, anyway?\\
44 - Fine.\\
45 - Good, good.\\
46 - Jake showed me some pictures.\\
47 - I gotta say, she doesn't look much like you,\\
48 - and she certainly doesn't look like Herb.\\
49 - Don't go there, Alan.\\
50 - Go where? I'm not implying\\
51 - that someone other than Herb could be the father.\\
52 - Even though that someone did have unprotected sex with you\\
53 - approximately nine months before the birth of a child\\
54 - that looks suspiciously like that someone.\\
55 - You get that I'm talking about me, right?\\
56 - Honey, if we want to beat the traffic,\\
57 - we really should get going. Oh, hey, Alan.\\
58 - Hey, Herb. Did you hear?\\
59 - Judith and I are spending a romantic weekend in Laguna.\\
60 - I said "weekend," Herb. That's all.\\
61 - Okay, fine, no romance.\\
62 - But sex is still on the table, right?\\
63 - Just get in the car.\\
64 - Oh, can I drive? No.\\
65 - Why not?!\\
66 - Is she gone?\\
67 - (cat screeching) Damn it!\\
68 - Chelsea, your cat's trying to kill me!\\
69 - CHELSEA: Is he okay?\\
70 - The cat's fine!\\
71 - Probably off plotting his next move... Whoa!\\
72 - (thudding) Whoa!\\
73 - Are you okay?\\
74 - No.\\
75 - What happened?\\
76 - Uncle Charlie fell.\\
77 - Oh.\\
78 - Can I drive you to the hospital?\\
79 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
80 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
81 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
82 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
83 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
84 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
85 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
86 - * Men. CHELSEA: Sir Lancelot!\\
87 - Here, kitty, kitty!\\
88 - He's probably hiding\\
89 - because he thinks you're mad at him.\\
90 - For God's sake, Chelsea,\\
91 - the cat doesn't think anything except maybe,\\
92 - "Mmm, fish, I'll eat it."\\
93 - Or "Ooh, sand, I'll crap in it."\\
94 - You're wrong.\\
95 - He's very intelligent and very intuitive.\\
96 - He knows you resent him living here.\\
97 - Thank you, Chelsea, but I can defend myself.\\
98 - I was talking about my cat.\\
99 - Oh, oh, I'm sorry.\\
100 - Mmm, fish. Yum.\\
101 - Okay, I'm going to work.\\
102 - Feel better.\\
103 - Thanks.\\
104 - How's the shoulder?\\
105 - The shoulder's fine.\\
106 - I'm just hopin' to get a little "Oh, poor Charlie" tonight.\\
107 - "Oh, poor Charlie"?\\
108 - Yeah. You know,\\
109 - "Oh, poor Charlie.\\
110 - "I feel bad about your shoulder, so you just lie still\\
111 - while I provide you with a series of intense orgasms."\\
112 - Wow.\\
113 - I don't know what to say, other than "oink."\\
114 - (engine starting)\\
115 - Is that a car? Can I drive?\\
116 - Can I drive? Relax, it's just Chelsea going to work.\\
117 - Oh.\\
118 - Uncle Charlie, you need to go anywhere?\\
119 - Yeah, away from you.\\
120 - All right. I'll drive you.\\
121 - You want to drive my $80,000 Mercedes?\\
122 - Yes, please.\\
123 - It's good that he's polite.\\
124 - It's a necessary quality in a doorman.\\
125 - Was that a "yes" or a "no"?\\
126 - That was a "no."\\
127 - So the doorman thing was an insult?\\
128 - Yes.\\
129 - Oh.\\
130 - And a prophecy.\\
131 - (phone rings)\\
132 - (alarm blaring) Hello?\\
133 - No, it's Charlie.\\
134 - Who's this?\\
135 - I can't hear you. What?\\
136 - Alan, it's for you.\\
137 - Oh.\\
138 - Hello?\\
139 - Oh, oh, hi, Lenore.\\
140 - It's, uh, Judith's mother.\\
141 - Uh, is that the house alarm?\\
142 - Uh, is-is the baby okay?\\
143 - All right, open the little panel by the front door\\
144 - and enter pound, star and the code.\\
145 - Pound is the little tic-tac-toe board.\\
146 - Yeah, like on Hollywood Squares.\\
147 - She still poppin' the pain pills?\\
148 - No.\\
149 - Good. See if she's got any leftovers.\\
150 - Okay, the code is Jake's birthday.\\
151 - Your grandson.\\
152 - Anyway, it's oh-three-one-four--\\
153 - Oh, no, no, Le-Lenore, don't punch it into the phone.\\
154 - No, Lenore! Lenore! Lenore!\\
155 - Okay, okay, okay, calm down, calm down.\\
156 - I-I'll be right there.\\
157 - I-I will turn it off for you.\\
158 - Oh, okay, okay. Bye.\\
159 - (grunting): I gotta go.\\
160 - You couldn't be more of a sucker\\
161 - if you were on the end of a stick.\\
162 - Why?\\
163 - Because I'll take any excuse\\
164 - to spend some time with my baby daughter?\\
165 - You don't know you're the father, Alan.\\
166 - Oh, come on.\\
167 - She's got my jawline, my eyes, my ears.\\
168 - You left out thinning hair and poopy pants.\\
169 - That was one time\\
170 - and I begged you to stop at a gas station.\\
171 - (alarm blaring) * Men.\\
172 - (baby crying)\\
173 - Oh, Alan, thank God you're here.\\
174 - I pushed all the buttons, but I can't get it to stop.\\
175 - Well, that might be\\
176 - because you were adjusting the thermostat.\\
177 - (alarm stops) Ah, there we go.\\
178 - Oh, thank God.\\
179 - (crying continues) Oh, here, let me see\\
180 - if I can turn this alarm off.\\
181 - Come here, Millie.\\
182 - Come to Papa...\\
183 - * ...was a rolling stone\\
184 - * Wherever he laid his hat was his home... *\\
185 - Always sang this to Jake.\\
186 - Worked like a charm.\\
187 - (crying continues)\\
188 - (high-pitched): * And when he died\\
189 - * All he left us was alone. *\\
190 - (crying stops)\\
191 - Huh, look at that.\\
192 - Well, you're a miracle worker, Alan.\\
193 - Oh, no.\\
194 - I just have a knack for babies.\\
195 - And, uh, and animals.\\
196 - It's only English-speaking adults that don't like me.\\
197 - Well, I think you're a wonderful fella.\\
198 - And if you don't mind my saying,\\
199 - I think Judith was a fool to let you go.\\
200 - Well, she didn't so much let me go\\
201 - as drop me from an airplane with an anvil necklace.\\
202 - Okay, honey, time to get your beauty rest.\\
203 - I'm afraid that's gonna have to be a long nap.\\
204 - I mean, I hate to say it about my own granddaughter,\\
205 - but let's face it-- with those big ears\\
206 - she looks a little like a fruit bat.\\
207 - I think her ears are the perfect size.\\
208 - You would.\\
209 - How about some wine?\\
210 - Uh, uh, well, thank you, but I-I really should get going.\\
211 - Oh, no, come on, join me.\\
212 - Just one. We'll catch up.\\
213 - Uh... Lenore, it's really none of my business,\\
214 - but do you think you should really be drinking?\\
215 - What? You mean, because I've been to Betty Ford?\\
216 - Oh, no, no, uh,\\
217 - because you got kicked out of Betty Ford.\\
218 - Hey, Britney bit me first.\\
219 - Anyway, I was there for pills.\\
220 - I've never had a problem with alcohol.\\
221 - Oh.\\
222 - See?\\
223 - No problem.\\
224 - Okay, now,\\
225 - where did I hide those muscle relaxers\\
226 - I picked up in Mexico?\\
227 - That's right.\\
228 - Between my buttcheeks.\\
229 - Turn around.\\
230 - * Men.\\
231 - Uncle Charlie?\\
232 - What?\\
233 - You hungry?\\
234 - 'Cause if you are, we could go get something to eat.\\
235 - And I'll even drive.\\
236 - Jake, I'm sleeping.\\
237 - Okay.\\
238 - You know, you could nap in the car.\\
239 - I just gotta have an adult with me.\\
240 - They don't have to be conscious.\\
241 - I'm not hungry.\\
242 - Okay, fine.\\
243 - Hey, want to go see a movie? 'Cause if you do...\\
244 - (grunting)\\
245 - Maybe after your nap.\\
246 - Oh, crap, now I'm awake.\\
247 - Great.\\
248 - You hungry?\\
249 - * Men.\\
250 - You're lucky you're single, Alan.\\
251 - Oh, I don't know.\\
252 - Oh, no, trust me.\\
253 - I've been married for 39 years!\\
254 - Really?\\
255 - But Judith's 40.\\
256 - Shh.\\
257 - Do you know what it's like to wake up every morning,\\
258 - year after year,\\
259 - and see the same stupid face lying next to you?\\
260 - Uh, well, all I can tell you is what I told your daughter.\\
261 - If you don't like it, roll over.\\
262 - Fred hasn't touched me in 14 years.\\
263 - Uh, well, uh, in his defense,\\
264 - he did have that stroke.\\
265 - Do you know what happens to a woman's body\\
266 - when it goes unloved for that long?\\
267 - Oh, gee, Lenore, I don't really\\
268 - feel comfortable talking about this...\\
269 - Oh, now, Alan, come on, we're both grown-ups.\\
270 - Think about what I'm saying.\\
271 - All right, well...\\
272 - I'm getting an image of a...\\
273 - a cave from an Indiana Jones movie.\\
274 - What?!\\
275 - Well, you know-- cobwebs,\\
276 - dust, human skulls.\\
277 - This is my vagina we're talking about.\\
278 - Oh, I am well aware of what we're talking about.\\
279 - (voice breaking): I've been so lonely.\\
280 - Oh, oh, I'm...\\
281 - I'm sorry, Lenore.\\
282 - Mmm.\\
283 - A stroke's starting to look pretty good.\\
284 - * Men.\\
285 - Can't I at least back it out?\\
286 - No.\\
287 - Come on, nothing's gonna happen.\\
288 - Look, you wanna eat or not?\\
289 - Fine.\\
290 - What if we went to an empty parking lot?\\
291 - Could I drive it then?\\
292 - Dammit, Jake, how many times I gotta tell...\\
293 - (cat screeching)\\
294 - What the hell was that?\\
295 - I don't know.\\
296 - Sounds like you ran over a cat.\\
297 - * Men.\\
298 - * Men.\\
299 - Told you you should've let me drive.\\
300 - You know, Chelsea's gonna completely freak out.\\
301 - No, she will not be happy.\\
302 - Doesn't even look like a cat anymore.\\
303 - Nope.\\
304 - More like a cat pancake.\\
305 - Catcake.\\
306 - Sorry.\\
307 - What am I gonna tell her?\\
308 - She doesn't have to know.\\
309 - You're right.\\
310 - She thinks Sir Lancelot's missing, so he stays missing.\\
311 - Sir Squished-a-lot.\\
312 - Okay, okay, let's just think what we gotta do.\\
313 - We have to get rid of the body,\\
314 - clean up the mess then act like nothing's happened.\\
315 - Good plan, except...\\
316 - Except what? Say, "cheese!"\\
317 - What are you doing?\\
318 - Making sure I get to drive your car whenever I want to.\\
319 - What?! Give me that!\\
320 - Too late, I already emailed it to myself.\\
321 - You're bluffing.\\
322 - Perhaps.\\
323 - But can you really afford to take that chance?\\
324 - * Men.\\
325 - * Hush, little baby, don't say a word *\\
326 - * Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird *\\
327 - * If that mockingbird don't sing *\\
328 - Forget it, I'm not sleepy.\\
329 - Let's go in the hot tub!\\
330 - Uh, but I don't have a bathing suit.\\
331 - Me neither.\\
332 - Come on, stroke.\\
333 - (phone ringing)\\
334 - Judith, ugh.\\
335 - Oh, this just keeps getting better and better.\\
336 - (baby crying) Oh, hey, look who's up.\\
337 - Hi, sweetie.\\
338 - You need a little change?\\
339 - (sniffs) Oh, yeah.\\
340 - I'll let you in on a little secret.\\
341 - Before this day is over,\\
342 - I might need to change my undies, too.\\
343 - (cell phone ringtone)\\
344 - Uh-oh, it's your mommy again.\\
345 - Shh.\\
346 - Hello?\\
347 - Oh, hey, Judith, what's up?\\
348 - So, how's Laguna?\\
349 - Laguna's fine.\\
350 - Um, listen, my mother's not answering the phone\\
351 - so I need you to go check on her and the baby.\\
352 - Me?\\
353 - You, uh, you want me to drive all the way to Sherman Oaks\\
354 - to check on your mother who you assured me was clean and sober?\\
355 - (baby crying)\\
356 - What's that?\\
357 - Uh, uh, that is the... is the TV that I am watching.\\
358 - The... Baby Channel.\\
359 - A... uh, uh... documentary about obese babies.\\
360 - Tragic.\\
361 - Okay, listen, I-I will check up on your mother for you\\
362 - but, uh, you owe me one.\\
363 - (sing-song): Oh, Alan...\\
364 - Ta-da!\\
365 - Not bad.\\
366 - What's not bad?\\
367 - Uh, I mean, it's not a bad idea for me to check up on her.\\
368 - Thank you. Call me when you get there.\\
369 - (sing-song) Oh, Judith...\\
370 - Look who mowed the front lawn.\\
371 - * Men.\\
372 - So, we're agreed.\\
373 - We will never speak of this again.\\
374 - Well, that kind of depends on you, doesn't it?\\
375 - I've already got the shovel, Jake.\\
376 - I can dig another hole.\\
377 - CHELSEA: Charlie, I'm home!\\
378 - Hi, sweetie, how was work? Okay.\\
379 - I was a little worried about Sir Lancelot.\\
380 - Have you seen him?\\
381 - No, haven't seen him, not a trace.\\
382 - What about you, Jake?\\
383 - No, but if I was a cat I'd probably be on the beach.\\
384 - 'Cause, you know, the beach is one big litter box\\
385 - and the ocean is a giant fish bowl.\\
386 - Kind of like having a sushi bar in your bathroom.\\
387 - Wow, how great would that be?\\
388 - I guess.\\
389 - I'll still feel better when he comes back.\\
390 - We all will.\\
391 - You're quite the little liar, aren't you?\\
392 - I'm 15. My life depends on it.\\
393 - Chelsea, Uncle Charlie's gonna take me driving.\\
394 - Can we bring you back anything?\\
395 - * Men.\\
396 - That woman just cut you off!\\
397 - Learn how to drive, you whore!\\
398 - Yeah, I'm talking to you!\\
399 - Lenore, ooh, Lenore... Lenore, Lenore, we should probably keep it down.\\
400 - We don't want to wake the baby.\\
401 - What baby?\\
402 - Oh, right.\\
403 - Woof.\\
404 - (cell phone ringtone)\\
405 - Ugh.\\
406 - Hello, Judith.\\
407 - Yeah, I was just about to call you.\\
408 - Uh, the baby's fine, nothing to worry about.\\
409 - Hey, Judy, Judy, Judy!\\
410 - Uh... yeah, yeah, that's her.\\
411 - Uh-huh, blotto.\\
412 - Uh, no, no.\\
413 - No, no need to rush home, everything's under control.\\
414 - We're in the car, Millie's sleeping in the back seat\\
415 - and we're heading for Malibu.\\
416 - Ehab-ray.\\
417 - Ehab-ray?\\
418 - You said you were taking me for crabcakes at Gladstone's.\\
419 - Well, I'm sorry, but you just don't have a choice here.\\
420 - The hell I don't.\\
421 - Lenore? Lenore? Lenore!\\
422 - Red light.\\
423 - Slow down, slow down, stop!\\
424 - (brakes screeching)\\
425 - You're making me really nervous, you know that?\\
426 - * Men.\\
427 - (TV playing)\\
428 - Hey, you mind getting me another grape soda?\\
429 - Yeah, I mind. Get it yourself.\\
430 - Fine. I just have to send this jpeg to Chelsea real fast.\\
431 - (sighing)\\
432 - Okay, okay.\\
433 - Look who finally came home!\\
434 - Who?\\
435 - Sir Lancelot.\\
436 - You've been a bad kitty cat.\\
437 - I've been so worried about you.\\
438 - Okay, I'm confused.\\
439 - If that's Sir Lancelot, then what did we squash?\\
440 - Your hope of ever getting behind the wheel of my car again.\\
441 - Oh, man.\\
442 - Leverage is a fickle bitch, my friend.\\
443 - (doorbell ringing)\\
444 - CHELSEA: I got it!\\
445 - Can I help you?\\
446 - Sorry to bother you. I live down the beach\\
447 - and I'm looking for my cat.\\
448 - Oh, I'm sorry. I haven't seen it.\\
449 - In fact, I just found my little guy.\\
450 - I'm really worried.\\
451 - He's black and white, about yay big.\\
452 - Answers to Puss-Puss.\\
453 - CHELSEA: I'll keep an eye out for him.\\
454 - Looks like the fickle bitch is back.

1 - ANNOUNCER: Call now. Operators are standing by.\\
2 - Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.\\
3 - What are you doing?\\
4 - I'm calling them.\\
5 - Don't you want to be able to scramble an egg\\
6 - while it's still in the shell?\\
7 - Okay...\\
8 - new rule-- you can't drink while we watch cable television.\\
9 - You won't say that when you get\\
10 - a blanket with sleeves for Christmas.\\
11 - Hi, Jake.\\
12 - Hmm.\\
13 - Can I offer you\\
14 - some fruit and cheese?\\
15 - You can, but I won't eat it.\\
16 - Okay.\\
17 - So what's new?\\
18 - How's your girlfriend?\\
19 - That's kind of personal, isn't it?\\
20 - Sorry. I'm just curious.\\
21 - Why, you writing a book?\\
22 - Yeah, it's called The Day Jake's Uncle Kicked His Ass.\\
23 - Whatever.\\
24 - Oh, no, don't go.\\
25 - We so enjoy your company.\\
26 - Did I do something wrong?\\
27 - Yeah, you anthropomorphized him.\\
28 - What?\\
29 - It means treating something\\
30 - that's not human as if it is.\\
31 - You know, like you do with your cat.\\
32 - Which frankly, makes more sense.\\
33 - I'm starting to think Jake resents me.\\
34 - See? You're still doing it.\\
35 - Look, you can't take it personal.\\
36 - He's a teenager.\\
37 - You know, that awkward stage between junior high\\
38 - and methadone clinic.\\
39 - I just want to get to know him better.\\
40 - I already know him.\\
41 - Trust me, you're not missing anything.\\
42 - Come on, there's got to be something\\
43 - underneath that sullen exterior.\\
44 - Yeah, a "D" student with a perpetual boner.\\
45 - Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.\\
46 - Ginzu knives.\\
47 - * Men.\\
48 - Kind of like high school, huh?\\
49 - I never did this in high school.\\
50 - Really? Sex in a car?\\
51 - You're kind of built for it.\\
52 - Oh, what the heck is this?\\
53 - Oh, Jake's retainer.\\
54 - He lost this years ago.\\
55 - This cost me like, $500.\\
56 - Anyway...\\
57 - No, this is not working for me.\\
58 - Want another wine cooler?\\
59 - No, I want to be in a real bed.\\
60 - Well, what do you want me to do?\\
61 - You won't stay at Charlie's.\\
62 - How can I go back there\\
63 - after his fiancee called me a tramp?\\
64 - Oh, come on, she didn't mean it.\\
65 - That was just heat of the moment\\
66 - when she found out you'd slept with Charlie.\\
67 - It doesn't bother you, does it?\\
68 - Well, yeah, yeah, a bit, you know,\\
69 - but beggars can't be choosers.\\
70 - And I love you.\\
71 - No, not here.\\
72 - Well, then where?\\
73 - I'd be more than happy to go back to your place\\
74 - if you could just get past that little incident with your mother.\\
75 - Little incident?\\
76 - I caught you in bed with her!\\
77 - Boy, you are just going to keep harping on that, aren't you?\\
78 - Why don't we just got to a hotel?\\
79 - Uh, well, we could, but wouldn't that feel kind of cheap?\\
80 - I'll tell you what feels kind of cheap-- you.\\
81 - What are you doing?\\
82 - I'm getting out of here.\\
83 - What-what, you're gonna walk home?\\
84 - Well, it's not far, Alan.\\
85 - You didn't want to waste the gas, remember?\\
86 - Pardon me for being green.\\
87 - Good-bye.\\
88 - Oh, come on, Melissa!\\
89 - Let's not ruin a beautiful evening!\\
90 - I already broke the seal on the condom!\\
91 - All right, all right.\\
92 - All right, you win, you win.\\
93 - I'll take you to a cheap motel.\\
94 - (siren blaring)\\
95 - Oh, great. POLICE OFFICER: Stand up\\
96 - and put your hands behind your head.\\
97 - Uh, I can explain this.\\
98 - Hands behind your head!\\
99 - This is not what it looks like.\\
100 - I-I-I was just chasing this girl\\
101 - who jumped out of my car.\\
102 - Oh...\\
103 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
104 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\

110 - (playing "Smoke on the Water")\\
111 - (knocking at door)\\
112 - You got a minute?\\
113 - I'm practicing.\\
114 - Yeah, well, take a pause for the cause.\\
115 - What?\\
116 - Take five.\\
117 - Five what?\\
118 - Just shut up and listen to me!\\
119 - You have a problem with Chelsea?\\
120 - No.\\
121 - So what's with the attitude?\\
122 - What attitude?\\
123 - I just don't consider fruit and cheese an acceptable snack.\\
124 - I don't care. You were rude.\\
125 - Kettle corn-- that's a snack.\\
126 - That's not the point.\\
127 - Nachos-- that's a proper use of cheese.\\
128 - All right, all right, listen to me.\\
129 - You're hurting Chelsea's feelings\\
130 - and I need you to make an effort to be nicer to her.\\
131 - Hey, it's not my problem\\
132 - if your girlfriend's oversensitive.\\
133 - Yeah, it kind of is.\\
134 - If you guys can't get along, then one of you has got to go.\\
135 - And guess who that's going to be?\\
136 - Why? Just 'cause you sleep with her?\\
137 - Good for you. Why do people think you're stupid?\\
138 - 'Cause of my grades.\\
139 - Actually, I'm an underachiever.\\
140 - Just be nice to Chelsea, all right?\\
141 - Fine.\\
142 - (playing hard rock riff)\\
143 - (door closes)\\
144 - Well, that was uncalled for.\\
145 - Just F.Y.I., your son's a moron.\\
146 - No, he's an underachiever.\\
147 - Where have you been?\\
148 - Had a date with Melissa.\\
149 - How'd it go?\\
150 - She broke up with me\\
151 - and I may have to register as a sex offender.\\
152 - Well, as long as you had fun.\\
153 - Charlie, do you have any idea\\
154 - how difficult it is to maintain a relationship\\
155 - when you don't have a place of your own?\\
156 - Alan, if I didn't have a place of my own,\\
157 - I'd be worried about more important things than a relationship.\\
158 - Like, you know, getting a place of my own.\\
159 - So, you're saying I'm not entitled to a relationship?\\
160 - No, I'm saying if you can't afford dog food\\
161 - you don't get a dog.\\
162 - Oh, great, so I'm just supposed to be\\
163 - alone for the rest of my life?\\
164 - No, you're supposed to get your own freakin' place!\\
165 - Just 'cause you keep saying it, doesn't mean it's gonna happen.\\
166 - * Men.\\
167 - How's the French toast, Jake?\\
168 - It's bread dipped in eggs.\\
169 - You can't really screw it up.\\
170 - It's fine.\\
171 - It's the best damn French toast\\
172 - I've ever had in my whole freakin' life.\\
173 - Now stop kicking me.\\
174 - Okay, guys, I'll see you later.\\
175 - Oh, you're working on a Sunday?\\
176 - Well, kind of.\\
177 - Since my brother and I are both extremely anxious\\
178 - for me to get my own place--\\
179 - me, because I'd like a sense of autonomy,\\
180 - and him, because he's a spiteful turd--\\
181 - um...\\
182 - I have found a way to earn some extra money.\\
183 - Great. Put me down for three boxes of Thin Mints\\
184 - and some Peanut Butter Sandies.\\
185 - Ah, Girl Scout cookies? I like those Samoas.\\
186 - I'm not selling cookies, Jake.\\
187 - Oh...\\
188 - Then what are you selling?\\
189 - It better not be your liver-- I got dibs.\\
190 - EVELYN: Hello.\\
191 - Where is my new assistant?\\
192 - Oh, you didn't.\\
193 - Morning, all.\\
194 - Here, darling, put this on.\\
195 - Ooh, snazzy. Do I get to keep it?\\
196 - No, but if this works out, I'll sell it to you at cost.\\
197 - You're going to work for Mom?\\
198 - What else am I supposed to do?\\
199 - I don't know, some job that lets you keep your self-respect.\\
200 - Like, you know, man whore...\\
201 - Dog de-wormer...\\
202 - Outhouse inspector.\\
203 - Morning, Charlie. Hey, Mom. How are you?\\
204 - Laxative tester, horse inseminator.\\
205 - I'm going to work weekends with Mom selling real estate,\\
206 - and she's going to give me a piece of the action.\\
207 - No, I said having an assistant would give me a little peace\\
208 - so I could get some action.\\
209 - Well, whatever. It's a start.\\
210 - Let's go.\\
211 - No, dear.\\
212 - I say, "Let's go."\\
213 - Oh, oh, okay.\\
214 - Let's go.\\
215 - Stop.\\
216 - Take my bag.\\
217 - Now let's go.\\
218 - This is going to be fun.\\
219 - Okay, I'm done.\\
220 - He didn't say thank you.\\
221 - He's leaving the room. We should thank him.\\
222 - Jake, come back in here and say thank you to Chelsea.\\
223 - Jake, I'm warning you.\\
224 - Jake!\\
225 - (muffled): Thank you, Chelsea.\\
226 - Now was that so hard?\\
227 - * Men.\\
228 - Oh, welcome, welcome.\\
229 - Please sign in. Take a flyer.\\
230 - There's juice and cookies in the kitchen.\\
231 - Thank you.\\
232 - I know, you think you'd never use a bidet,\\
233 - but trust me, once you do, you'll never go back\\
234 - to just wiping.\\
235 - Anyway, if you're not ready to buy,\\
236 - the owners are willing to lease.\\
237 - Thank you.\\
238 - You're very welcome.\\
239 - Thanks for coming.\\
240 - Oh, the rat bastards live right across the street.\\
241 - They probably just came for the free cookies.\\
242 - Um, Mom, I have to go to the bathroom.\\
243 - Number one or number two?\\
244 - What difference does it make?\\
245 - Alan, I'm trying to sell a house here.\\
246 - Warm cookie smell, good-- hot poop smell, bad.\\
247 - I'll wait.\\
248 - You're damn right you'll wait.\\
249 - So the people who own this live mostly in New York?\\
250 - Oh, they have homes all over the place.\\
251 - Probably don't even remember they have this one.\\
252 - Hardly seems fair.\\
253 - Want fair? Go live on a kibbutz.\\
254 - Funny.\\
255 - How's that work, exactly?\\
256 - Do you have to be Jewish?\\
257 - Oh, welcome, welcome.\\
258 - Please sign in.\\
259 - Uh, there's juice and cookies in the kitchen.\\
260 - (muffled flatulence)\\
261 - Loose floorboard.\\
262 - * Men.\\
263 - Okay, we need to talk about your kid and my fianc  e.\\
264 - I already talked to him,\\
265 - and he promised to stay out of her underwear drawer.\\
266 - What?\\
267 - Not that he ever went into it.\\
268 - It's just a precaution.\\
269 - Alan, I don't think you realize...\\
270 - Look, look, look, I would love to have this conversation,\\
271 - but I've got to get to work.\\
272 - It's 9:00 at night.\\
273 - Tell that to our mother. People want to see a house\\
274 - at night and she's got a date, guess who has to show the house?\\
275 - Well, fine, at least take the rhesus monkey with you.\\
276 - Oh yeah, nothing sells a multi-million dollar home\\
277 - more than a 15-year-old boy with greasy hair and BO.\\
278 - Okay, let him stand on the lawn\\
279 - in a jockey costume, holding a lantern.\\
280 - Look, you're the one who said I needed to get my own place.\\
281 - This is what I got to do.\\
282 - You don't fool me.\\
283 - You're never leaving.\\
284 - Never!\\
285 - That's it.\\
286 - I'm done trying with that kid.\\
287 - (sighs)\\
288 - When did my life turn into Leave it to Beaver?\\
289 - It was more fun when it was Leave it to Beaver.\\
290 - Okay, numb nuts, what did you say to Chelsea?\\
291 - Nothing. Then why is she so upset?\\
292 - I don't know. Maybe it's her period.\\
293 - She says it wasn't, but I don't believe her.\\
294 - * Men.\\
295 - (doorbell rings)\\
296 - Ah...\\
297 - Welcome to our love nest, my tiny sparrow.\\
298 - * Men.\\
299 - * Men.\\
300 - This is unbelievable.\\
301 - How can you afford it?\\
302 - Well, I didn't buy it, of course. I'm renting.\\
303 - I don't get it.\\
304 - Just the other day we were going to do it in your car\\
305 - because you didn't want to shell out $59\\
306 - for a hotel room.\\
307 - It was $69, but, uh...\\
308 - But this is different. I, uh...\\
309 - I get a tax break on it. You know, the home office.\\
310 - So, you've moved out of your brother's house?\\
311 - Uh, well, not quite yet.\\
312 - This is just a pied-a-terre.\\
313 - Besides, I might flip it\\
314 - and move up to something a little bigger.\\
315 - But you said you're renting.\\
316 - Yes, yes, I'm renting...\\
317 - with-with an option to flip.\\
318 - But let's not talk money.\\
319 - Let's talk love.\\
320 - Shall we go try out the bed?\\
321 - The bed? With the-- with the sheets?\\
322 - Um...\\
323 - Beds are so bourgeois, don't you think?\\
324 - Ooh, Alan. The couch?\\
325 - Uh, actually I was thinking right here\\
326 - in front of the fireplace...\\
327 - on this beach towel.\\
328 - Come on. I was trying to be nice.\\
329 - By asking her if she was on her period?\\
330 - I was taking an interest.\\
331 - You're an idiot.\\
332 - Why are you making it personal? I'm not making it personal.\\
333 - Okay, here's the deal.\\
334 - You two are going to stay in here and work this thing out\\
335 - until you're either getting along\\
336 - or one of you is dead.\\
337 - FYI, she can kick your ass.\\
338 - Have fun.\\
339 - (door closes)\\
340 - Hey.\\
341 - Hey.\\
342 - So...\\
343 - I guess you owe me an apology.\\
344 - * Men.\\
345 - Wow.\\
346 - (both chuckling)\\
347 - I've never seen you so forceful and virile.\\
348 - Oh, thank you, thank you.\\
349 - You were wonderful, too.\\
350 - You're-You're still on the towel, right?\\
351 - You know what I think?\\
352 - I think finally making love in a place of our own\\
353 - has given you more confidence.\\
354 - Well, truth be told, I do feel kind of cocky.\\
355 - No pun intended.\\
356 - Oh, it is so intended.\\
357 - Ah. You got me. (laughing)\\
358 - Yes, I do.\\
359 - (moans)\\
360 - I want to make love to you in every room in this house.\\
361 - I don't see any reason why not.\\
362 - As long as we bring the towel.\\
363 - Of course, we're going to have to wait about a half hour,\\
364 - give my erectile medication a chance\\
365 - to overcome my anti-depressants.\\
366 - Complicated man, Alan Harper.\\
367 - And I've got the medicine chest to prove it.\\
368 - (laughing)\\
369 - Whoopsie.\\
370 - Oh, damn it!\\
371 - Sorry.\\
372 - Sorry doesn't get out the stain.\\
373 - Do you have any club soda?\\
374 - How the hell would I know? Don't rub!\\
375 - Blot, blot, blot!\\
376 - Stop yelling at me!\\
377 - Just get out of the way. What is wrong with you?\\
378 - Nothing. I just...\\
379 - (screams): Oh, no!\\
380 - That's your whoopsie.\\
381 - Oh, my mother's going to kill me!\\
382 - What does your mother have to do with it?\\
383 - Are you kidding? She doesn't even let me poop here!\\
384 - * Men.\\
385 - Hey, so, how did everything work out?\\
386 - Sit down, Charlie.\\
387 - Why?\\
388 - Just sit.\\
389 - Okay.\\
390 - What's going on?\\
391 - We figured out what the problem is between us.\\
392 - Well, great. What is it?\\
393 - You.\\
394 - Well, this ought to be good.\\
395 - You told Jake that he should be nice to me\\
396 - because I was oversensitive?\\
397 - Well, I don't know that I said those actual words.\\
398 - And you called me a "D" student with a perpetual...\\
399 - you know what.\\
400 - Boner.\\
401 - Yeah, those were my actual words.\\
402 - Charlie, don't you see how you're the one\\
403 - who's been driving a wedge between us?\\
404 - No, not really.\\
405 - I told you he wouldn't get it.\\
406 - Well, hang on a second. Hang on.\\
407 - You're blaming me\\
408 - because you two can't get along and now...\\
409 - You're right. You're right.\\
410 - I'm the problem. I am so sorry.\\
411 - It won't ever happen again.\\
412 - Thank you. Thanks.\\
413 - "Perpetual" means "pointy," right?\\
414 - * Men.\\
415 - Okay, I think I got it all out.\\
416 - You didn't have to yell.\\
417 - I know. I'm... I'm sorry.\\
418 - I don't know what got into me.\\
419 - It was just an accident.\\
420 - I know.\\
421 - You hurt my feelings.\\
422 - Again, I am so sorry.\\
423 - Come here.\\
424 - (clicking tongue)\\
425 - (door opening)\\
426 - Now, wait till you see\\
427 - the panoramic city to ocean views at night.\\
428 - Why are we running?\\
429 - Well, remember when I told you I rented this house?\\
430 - Yeah? I lied.\\
431 - (police siren wails)\\
432 - Oh, no. Not again.\\
433 - Okay. Okay.\\
434 - Just let me do the talking.\\
435 - Melissa?\\
436 - POLICE OFFICER: Get down on your knees,\\
437 - and put your hands behind your head.\\
438 - Uh, okay. Okay.\\
439 - First of all, let me explain the erection.\\
440 - * Men.\\
441 - What's going on?\\
442 - Not much.\\
443 - Where's Jake and Chelsea?\\
444 - They went to the movies together.\\
445 - Oh, how nice.\\
446 - Yep.\\
447 - Life is good.\\
448 - Hmm.\\
449 - So, did you sell that house?\\
450 - Uh, no.\\
451 - Actually, I'm not working for Mom anymore.\\
452 - You quit?\\
453 - Yeah, let's say that.\\
454 - And while we're at it, let's say I dumped Melissa\\
455 - and decided she never wants to see me again\\
456 - as long as she lives.\\
457 - Okay.\\
458 - Mm-hmm.\\
459 - Oh, uh, hey, you know how they say\\
460 - if you take one of those pills\\
461 - and your erection lasts for more than four hours,\\
462 - you should call a doctor?\\
463 - Yeah.\\
464 - What time is it?
\subsection {Episode 05: For the Sake of the Child}
1 - * Men. *\\
2 - ALAN: Not yet. Not yet.\\
3 - Okay.\\
4 - Wait for the traffic to clear,\\
5 - and then turn into the left lane.\\
6 - Not yet. Not yet.\\
7 - Okay. Go.\\
8 - Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.\\
9 - Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God. (tires screeching)\\
10 - (horn honking)\\
11 - All right, good.\\
12 - Good, well done.\\
13 - Thank you.\\
14 - What are you doing?\\
15 - Driving.\\
16 - Both hands-- ten and two.\\
17 - Twelve.\\
18 - What?\\
19 - No, no, like a clock.\\
20 - 10:00 and 2:00.\\
21 - I have no idea what you're talking about.\\
22 - Put your left hand on the wheel.\\
23 - Fine.\\
24 - You got to like that he can add ten and two.\\
25 - Yeah.\\
26 - And he did it in his head.\\
27 - (music plays on radio)\\
28 - Hey, hey, hey, hey.\\
29 - Concentrate on the road. (turns off radio)\\
30 - What? You listen to the radio while you drive.\\
31 - I'm an experienced driver.\\
32 - You drive like an old woman.\\
33 - An experienced old woman.\\
34 - My point is, never take your eyes off the road.\\
35 - Hey, don't distract the kid.\\
36 - He can barely crap and read at the same time.\\
37 - I can, too! Don't look at me!\\
38 - Look at the road! Don't yell at him! Jake, look out!\\
39 - Look out! (horn blaring)\\
40 - Will you guys just let me drive?\\
41 - Fine, fine.\\
42 - Drive.\\
43 - (breathing deeply)\\
44 - So, Charlie, when's your, uh...\\
45 - when's your fianc  e back in town?\\
46 - Uh... next week.\\
47 - Huh. So, uh...\\
48 - so her dad's out of the hospital?\\
49 - Yep. They gave him his new hip and sent him home.\\
50 - Huh.\\
51 - So, he had a bad hip?\\
52 - No, Alan, he has a bad tooth,\\
53 - but he went to the wrong doctor.\\
54 - You don't have to be snide.\\
55 - You don't have to ask dumb-ass questions.\\
56 - He didn't ask me anything.\\
57 - Yellow light, yellow light, yellow light. Speed up.\\
58 - Speed up, speed up, speed up! Slow down, slow down, slow down!\\
59 - Okay, I've just about had it with you two.\\
60 - Now, if you don't quit it, I'm going to turn this car around\\
61 - and nobody's going to the movies.\\
62 - Man, I've always wanted to say that.\\
63 - I have to go to the bathroom.\\
64 - You should have peed when he made that left turn, like I did.\\
65 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
66 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
67 - * Men. *\\
68 - Oh, there's, uh... there's three over there.\\
69 - Too far away. (groans)\\
70 - Why don't you ever wear your glasses? Because I don't need them.\\
71 - Oh, really? So, why did your eye doctor prescribe them?\\
72 - It's a racket.\\
73 - I think they print those charts blurry,\\
74 - and then tell you it's your eyes.\\
75 - Look, can we just sit down?\\
76 - No, no, slide... slide over one.\\
77 - Slide over one. I need the aisle.\\
78 - Why do you always need the aisle?\\
79 - Because he's got a prostate the size of an apple,\\
80 - and he has to pee every five minutes.\\
81 - There's nothing wrong with my prostate.\\
82 - I've got a teeny bladder. It's genetic.\\
83 - Another reason I think you were adopted.\\
84 - Ha, ha.\\
85 - Wasn't funny when I was six, not funny now.\\
86 - For God's sake, can't you at least wait\\
87 - until the lights go down?\\
88 - I'm hungry.\\
89 - Deviled egg?\\
90 - No.\\
91 - Close the lid.\\
92 - It smells like a box of ass.\\
93 - I don't know why they call them deviled eggs.\\
94 - I think they're just heavenly.\\
95 - Why can't you just sneak in candy like a normal cheapskate?\\
96 - Way ahead of you.\\
97 - Still got these left over from last Halloween.\\
98 - Shh.\\
99 - What the hell are you doing?\\
100 - How am I supposed to have a rum and Coke\\
101 - without the rum?\\
102 - You're not supposed to bring liquor\\
103 - into a movie theater.\\
104 - Oh, but it's fine to bring a big box of ass?\\
105 - CHARLIE: Where are you going?\\
106 - I'm going to sit over here.\\
107 - But... but this is family time.\\
108 - I like this family better.\\
109 - Oh, damn it!\\
110 - I have to pee.\\
111 - Oh, great.\\
112 - Focus!\\
113 - Focus!\\
114 - Focus!\\
115 - Another great movie choice, Alan.\\
116 - Excuse me, but it was recommended\\
117 - by four out of five critics\\
118 - who were not plowed when they saw it.\\
119 - Can we please just get some ice cream?\\
120 - You sure we need to buy some?\\
121 - Your dad probably has gelato in his pants.\\
122 - Uh-oh.\\
123 - What? Nothing.\\
124 - You know those girls? Kinda.\\
125 - You want to go over and say hello?\\
126 - Alan, don't be an idiot.\\
127 - No teenager wants to be seen out with his father.\\
128 - Especially when his father stinks of deviled ass eggs.\\
129 - Yeah, but teenagers love to be seen\\
130 - with degenerate rum-soaked uncles\\
131 - who always dress like they're on line at Epcot Center.\\
132 - Well, pardon me for having a personal style.\\
133 - Will you guys please, please shut up?\\
134 - Hi, Jake.\\
135 - Hey.\\
136 - Oh. She's cute.\\
137 - You guys go to school together?\\
138 - Of course they go to school together.\\
139 - Where else is he going to meet a girl like that?\\
140 - ALAN: He has outside interests. He could've met her anywhere.\\
141 - He only has two outside interests,\\
142 - and I don't think he met her\\
143 - at a taco truck or a public toilet.\\
144 - You know what, I'm not hungry. Let's just go.\\
145 - Hey, hey, hey, hey.\\
146 - We're not going anywhere.\\
147 - I want ice cream.\\
148 - Why, you going to pour rum on it? No.\\
149 - Cr  me de cacao.\\
150 - All that drinking. You know, I feel sorry for you.\\
151 - Don't feel sorry for me. You're the reason I drink!\\
152 - ALAN: Oh, please! If it weren't for me,\\
153 - you would've choked on your own vomit years ago.\\
154 - Hey, don't flatter yourself.\\
155 - I was vomiting\\
156 - in my sleep long before you came into my life,\\
157 - and I'll be vomiting long after you're gone.\\
158 - MAN: Next, please. Oh, yay.\\
159 - ALAN: Um...\\
160 - uh, I would like to sample\\
161 - the, uh... the Passion Fruit,\\
162 - and the Banana Brickle,\\
163 - and-- ooh-- uh, maybe the, uh, Nutty Butter Buddy.\\
164 - Oh, geez-- why don't you just get a double scoop of gayberry\\
165 - and be done with it?\\
166 - What... What do you want, Jake?\\
167 - A quick, painless death.\\
168 - Hey, what happened to those cute girls?\\
169 - They left.\\
170 - Oh, too bad.\\
171 - I think the one liked you.\\
172 - They were looking over here a lot.\\
173 - I know.\\
174 - Next time, take a little initiative.\\
175 - Yeah. We're not always going to be here to support you.\\
176 - * Men. *\\
177 - ALAN: So, you peek over your right shoulder\\
178 - and slide it into the spot.\\
179 - Parallel parking.\\
180 - Easy peasy.\\
181 - Are we home?\\
182 - We're dropping off Jake.\\
183 - Oh.\\
184 - I kind of got a sugar crash off that ice cream.\\
185 - Oh, yeah, it had nothing to do\\
186 - with the four ounces of liqueur you poured over it.\\
187 - Better liqueur than Halloween leftovers.\\
188 - They charge 50 cents for each topping,\\
189 - and I had perfectly good candy corn.\\
190 - Okay, bye.\\
191 - See you next weekend.\\
192 - Yeah, maybe. What's that mean?\\
193 - I'll call you.\\
194 - Okeydoke.\\
195 - Boy, you really pissed him off.\\
196 - I pissed him off? What about you?\\
197 - Hey, he likes me.\\
198 - Oh, please. Nobody likes you.\\
199 - We only tolerate you because you have a lot of money.\\
200 - All right, get out.\\
201 - What are you talking about?\\
202 - This is my car. Fine.\\
203 - How much do you want for it?\\
204 - (scoffs) Don't be ridiculous.\\
205 - We talking blue book? 'Cause I just put a new tire on it.\\
206 - * Men. *\\
207 - * Men. *\\
208 - ALAN: You are a lush!\\
209 - CHARLIE: You are a leech!\\
210 - ALAN: You are a misogynist!\\
211 - CHARLIE: You are a mistake!\\
212 - You are a...\\
213 - What are we up to? "N."\\
214 - Thank you.\\
215 - Uh, you are a...\\
216 - necrophiliac.\\
217 - She was drunk, not dead.\\
218 - I challenge.\\
219 - Okay, fine. You're a narcissist.\\
220 - Better.\\
221 - You are a Nancy boy.\\
222 - You are old.\\
223 - You are odd...\\
224 - ...ly shaped.\\
225 - (phone ringing) Hang on.\\
226 - You are a parasite.\\
227 - Not your turn.\\
228 - Hello.\\
229 - Oh, hey, Judith. What's up?\\
230 - What do you mean, what happened with Jake?\\
231 - We had a nice weekend.\\
232 - Well, we went driving, to the movies, um, ice cream.\\
233 - Quack, rectal, suck-wad!\\
234 - I never got my "P."\\
235 - All you do is pee.\\
236 - What? What? Uh, n-nothing.\\
237 - Little... little word game. You know,\\
238 - exercise the brain. Twit!\\
239 - Turd burglar!\\
240 - Judith, I-I-I don't know what Jake's problem is.\\
241 - We had a terrific weekend.\\
242 - Huh.\\
243 - Jake says he doesn't want to come here anymore.\\
244 - Really? Why?\\
245 - I don't know.\\
246 - Did he say why?\\
247 - Charlie and I don't bicker.\\
248 - I mean, no more than any other couple.\\
249 - Of guys.\\
250 - Right?\\
251 - Right.\\
252 - Oh, oh, oh!\\
253 - You are a eunuch.\\
254 - (sighs)\\
255 - That's "E," not "U."\\
256 - Learn to spell. Useless!\\
257 - Look, I don't know what to tell you.\\
258 - He's a teenager-- he'll get over it.\\
259 - Okay. Okay.\\
260 - Bye-bye.\\
261 - Well, I hope you're happy.\\
262 - I haven't been happy in seven years.\\
263 - For your information, I will not\\
264 - have been here seven years until next fall.\\
265 - Oh, good to know.\\
266 - Circle the date on the calendar\\
267 - so I'll know when to hang myself.\\
268 - Ha, ha. Funny.\\
269 - It-it's because of you Jake doesn't want\\
270 - to come here anymore. Great.\\
271 - Tell me what I did so I can do it to you.\\
272 - (sighs)\\
273 - God, you are such a...\\
274 - What are we up to? "V."\\
275 - Varmint!\\
276 - You are a varmint.\\
277 - Yeah, well...\\
278 - you are a vagina.\\
279 - You're calling me a vagina?\\
280 - No, no, no, no, no.\\
281 - No, that's too good for you.\\
282 - What you are is...\\
283 - vagina adjacent.\\
284 - You know, for some women,\\
285 - this could be considered a hostile work environment.\\
286 - * Men. *\\
287 - Hey.\\
288 - Isn't it past your bedtime?\\
289 - I don't like to go to sleep angry.\\
290 - Try drinking more.\\
291 - What will that solve?\\
292 - Sobriety.\\
293 - We need to talk.\\
294 - Oh, good.\\
295 - I was so worried we weren't going to talk.\\
296 - I've been thinking.\\
297 - Maybe Jake not wanting to hang out here\\
298 - does have something to do with us.\\
299 - I mean, we have been fighting a lot lately.\\
300 - So?\\
301 - So, don't you want him to feel comfortable here?\\
302 - He farts at the dinner table.\\
303 - How much more comfortable do we want him?\\
304 - Charlie, if you and I don't figure out a way to get along,\\
305 - there's a chance we might not see him anymore.\\
306 - And the downside is...?\\
307 - Come on, tough guy, you know you love him.\\
308 - Why don't you just admit it?\\
309 - Okay, I love him.\\
310 - Now go to your room and masturbate.\\
311 - Already did, still can't sleep.\\
312 - My point is, we have to work out our differences\\
313 - for the sake of the child.\\
314 - Are you out of your mind?\\
315 - I mean, if it weren't for Jake,\\
316 - we could just shake hands and walk away.\\
317 - After what you've been doing, there'll be no shaking of hands.\\
318 - I keep Purell in my nightstand.\\
319 - I'm not an animal.\\
320 - Where is this going, Alan?\\
321 - Well, I am glad you asked.\\
322 - A Blueprint for Love?\\
323 - It's a workbook Judith and I got in couples counseling.\\
324 - But the principles can be applied\\
325 - to any two human beings in a relationship.\\
326 - I see.\\
327 - So you did this right before she kicked your ass out\\
328 - and took everything you own?\\
329 - The principles are sound.\\
330 - Judith is an unreasonable bitch.\\
331 - Now, okay, uh, the, um, the first exercise--\\
332 - "Building a Foundation of Trust."\\
333 - So, we each say three things we admire about the other.\\
334 - Uh, I will go first. Um...\\
335 - I admire your sense of humor,\\
336 - uh, your generosity\\
337 - and your devil-may-care attitude.\\
338 - Thank you.\\
339 - Now, your turn-- three things you admire about me.\\
340 - Three? Really?\\
341 - All right, uh...\\
342 - I like that you think I'm funny.\\
343 - (laughs)\\
344 - Good one.\\
345 - Still counts, right?\\
346 - Sure.\\
347 - Two to go.\\
348 - What did Judith put?\\
349 - No cheating.\\
350 - Okay.\\
351 - Uh...\\
352 - you love your kid, which can't be easy.\\
353 - And...\\
354 - you disinfect your hands after you masturbate.\\
355 - Thank you.\\
356 - Now, that wasn't so difficult, was it?\\
357 - Okay, next.\\
358 - There's more?\\
359 - Have we healed our relationship, Charlie?\\
360 - I'm good.\\
361 - Okay: "Three things you would change about your partner,\\
362 - and three things you would change about yourself."\\
363 - This time you start.\\
364 - Why would I want to change anything about myself?\\
365 - You're kidding, right?\\
366 - You think you're perfect?\\
367 - In my way.\\
368 - Oh, so you have no flaws?\\
369 - Let us consider the hummingbird, Alan.\\
370 - Or the butterfly.\\
371 - All of God's creatures are perfect\\
372 - just the way he made them.\\
373 - Except you. You suck.\\
374 - Okay. Okay, fine.\\
375 - Name three things you would change about me.\\
376 - Your personality,\\
377 - your wardrobe and your address.\\
378 - Thank you.\\
379 - Your voice,\\
380 - your face, and again, your address.\\
381 - All right... (anxious laugh) All right.\\
382 - Your haircut, your fruity little workbook\\
383 - and your address.\\
384 - Just... Just needed three.\\
385 - Oh, come on, we're healing.\\
386 - Your cheapness,\\
387 - your smug arrogance and your address.\\
388 - I'm leaving.\\
389 - Hey, this thing really works!\\
390 - * Men. *\\
391 - The way you chew your food,\\
392 - the hair in your ears and your address.\\
393 - That stopped being funny a week ago.\\
394 - Judges?\\
395 - Still funny.\\
396 - So where's the kid this weekend?\\
397 - He's not coming, thanks to my brother.\\
398 - Thank you, Charlie.\\
399 - Sure, lay it all on me.\\
400 - Nothing's ever your fault.\\
401 - Hey, at least I was willing to work on our problems.\\
402 - What, that stupid Blueprint for Love?\\
403 - That was just an excuse to try to change me.\\
404 - You knew who I was when you moved in here.\\
405 - That doesn't mean you can't grow.\\
406 - Why can't you grow?\\
407 - Because you hold me back!\\
408 - Stop it!\\
409 - Can't you see you're tearing this family apart?!\\
410 - Hah! What a couple of 'mos.\\
411 - Look, can we at least establish some ground rules\\
412 - about how we treat each other in front of Jake?\\
413 - Like what?\\
414 - Like we agree that if there's something's bothering us,\\
415 - we wait and discuss it privately. Fine.\\
416 - And no name-calling. Done.\\
417 - And the sarcasm.\\
418 - While you and I know\\
419 - that our good-natured ribbing is all in fun,\\
420 - Jake might perceive it as hostile.\\
421 - I hate you.\\
422 - Exactly.\\
423 - If Jake heard you say that, he'd think you really meant it.\\
424 - I do mean it. I hate you.\\
425 - Funny. One of those things\\
426 - I admire about you.\\
427 - Now, come on, we'll get dressed and go talk to Jake.\\
428 - You know, I just thought\\
429 - of another thing I'd change about you.\\
430 - Oh, yeah? What's that?\\
431 - Your inability to accept my hatred.\\
432 - And your address!\\
433 - * Men. *\\
434 - Hey.\\
435 - He still says he doesn't want to spend the weekend with you two.\\
436 - You heard her, Al. Let's go.\\
437 - Oh, stop it.\\
438 - I'm serious. We don't need him.\\
439 - I can pick my nose and wipe it on your car seat.\\
440 - We'll talk to him.\\
441 - Where is he? In his room.\\
442 - Let me ask you something.\\
443 - How did you convince Alan you hated him?\\
444 - What? He won't believe me.\\
445 - ALAN: Charlie!\\
446 - It's not like I can withhold sex, like you did.\\
447 - If you think of anything, text me.\\
448 - (scoffs)\\
449 - (strumming and tuning guitar)\\
450 - Wow.\\
451 - You are getting pretty good.\\
452 - I'm just tuning it.\\
453 - Well, tune on, broheim.\\
454 - What are you doing here?\\
455 - Okay, first of all,\\
456 - your uncle and I would like to apologize\\
457 - for our behavior last week.\\
458 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
459 - I've got nothing to apologize for.\\
460 - Oh, really? So you've been just perfect\\
461 - through this whole thing?\\
462 - What can I tell you? I'm a hummingbird.\\
463 - Shut up, Charlie.\\
464 - I hate you, and you were adopted.\\
465 - Your uncle and I understand\\
466 - that we might have made you uncomfortable,\\
467 - and we want you to know\\
468 - that we're going to make a real effort to change.\\
469 - When are you planning to start?\\
470 - Right now.\\
471 - Right, Charlie? Yeah, sure.\\
472 - So, you guys will stop fighting so much? ALAN: Yes.\\
473 - Uh-huh. And you won't embarrass me in public anymore?\\
474 - When did we embarrass you in public?\\
475 - Oh, come on, you embarrass him constantly.\\
476 - Uh, you don't? Hey, I'm the colorful uncle.\\
477 - One day, he'll be telling his kids all kinds\\
478 - of funny stories about me.\\
479 - He'll be telling stories about me, too.\\
480 - Yeah, to his court-appointed psychiatrist.\\
481 - You know, you have got a cruel streak that is just ugly.\\
482 - You want to know what's just ugly?\\
483 - The schmuck who lives in my guest room.\\
484 - At least I am not an aging pretty boy\\
485 - desperately clinging on to the last dregs of his youth.\\
486 - What are you saying, I'm losing my looks?\\
487 - Oh, now you're worried.\\
488 - Let me tell you something, pal.\\
489 - Looks is all you've ever had.\\
490 - No heart, no soul, no depth of character whatsoever.\\
491 - Come on, be honest.\\
492 - Which would you rather have?\\
493 - My looks or those other three things?\\
494 - You know what? Bite me!\\
495 - I can't believe you actually bit me.\\
496 - Wait, wait!\\
497 - I thought you were going to talk to him.\\
498 - We did. He's still kind of upset with us.\\
499 - You know teenagers.\\
500 - You just can't reason with them.\\
501 - Oh, really? Wait right here.\\
502 - JUDITH: I don't give a damn!\\
503 - Weekends are the only peace I get around here!\\
504 - They're both losers!\\
505 - Deal with it!\\
506 - Now get your ass up and go with your father!\\
507 - I'm driving.\\
508 - I call shotgun.\\
509 - Shotgun? What are you, a child?\\
510 - Me a child? You just bit me!\\
511 - (engine revving)\\
512 - Hey, and don't rev it! You're wasting gas!\\
513 - (engine revving)\\
514 - Hey! Hey!\\
515 - Hey, come back here!\\
516 - Was he waving,\\
517 - or did he just give us the finger?\\
518 - Both hands on the wheel!\\
519 - 10:00 and 2:00!\\
520 - * Men. *\\
521 - * Men. *\\
522 - (grunts)\\
523 - Okay. Okay.\\
524 - That completes the "How to Disagree in a Loving Way" section.\\
525 - (slurred): I think we did very well.\\
526 - I disagree...\\
527 - but in a loving way.\\
528 - Okay, okay, next.\\
529 - Um... things we have in common.\\
530 - Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!\\
531 - Charlie.\\
532 - Same last name. Same last name.\\
533 - Oh! Very nice, very nice.\\
534 - Drink?\\
535 - Uh, yes, I am.\\
536 - (grunts)\\
537 - Okay, things we have in common, things we have in common.\\
538 - Uh... Mom!\\
539 - We both have the same mother.\\
540 - No, no, no, no, no, no.\\
541 - You're adopted.\\
542 - Oh, right, right, right.\\
543 - Okay, let's see, let's see.\\
544 - Uh, what do we have in common?\\
545 - Uh... Oh, oh, oh! Uh, here's one.\\
546 - Um, we both feel unworthy of love\\
547 - and battle homosexual panic.\\
548 - Maybe that's just me.\\
549 - Maybe.\\
550 - Mmm.\\
551 - Okay, okay, here's one, here's one.\\
552 - Uh, we both love Jake.\\
553 - Oh, Jake.\\
554 - Mmm.\\
555 - Yeah, I love him.\\
556 - Where is the little fartmeister?\\
557 - I think he's sleeping.\\
558 - Oh, he needs to know we love him.\\
559 - You're right. You're right.\\
560 - We don't tell him enough.\\
561 - Come on, let's go wake him up and tell him we love him.\\
562 - Mmm, good idea, good idea.\\
563 - Jake! Guess who loves you!
\subsection {Episode 06: Give Me Your Thumb}
1 - * Men. *\\
2 - Morning.\\
3 - Oh, morning.\\
4 - What you doing?\\
5 - Saving a little money, so Jake is brown-baggin' it.\\
6 - Oh, who am I kidding?\\
7 - Breakfast of champions.\\
8 - Type Two Diabetes Division.\\
9 - Charlie's still in bed?\\
10 - Uh-huh.\\
11 - Ow.\\
12 - You all right?\\
13 - Yeah, just a little back pain.\\
14 - Oh, no. Uh, would you like me to take a look?\\
15 - Oh, it's okay.\\
16 - Chelsea, I'm a chiropractor.\\
17 - This is what I do.\\
18 - Besides, you're like family now,\\
19 - which entitles you to my family and friends discount.\\
20 - All right.\\
21 - You'll actually be the first one to use it.\\
22 - Now, I trust your insurance is up-to-date.\\
23 - Yeah, but I don't think it covers chiropractic.\\
24 - Oh, of course not.\\
25 - Big insurance will pay\\
26 - for an 80-year-old man to get a boner,\\
27 - but God forbid his spine is erect.\\
28 - Now, how long have you been dealing with this pain?\\
29 - On and off since I'm a teenager.\\
30 - Aha, so, would this be around the time you started to develop?\\
31 - What do you mean?\\
32 - Well, you know, as a woman.\\
33 - Boobies.\\
34 - Oh, uh, yeah.\\
35 - Ah.\\
36 - I've always known that's a factor,\\
37 - but what are you gonna do?\\
38 - Well, I would recommend that you get two adjustments a week\\
39 - and ultrasound massage therapy.\\
40 - Plus, we'll work on strengthening your upper traps\\
41 - and rhomboids so they can support the load on your pecs.\\
42 - Or, in layman's terms,\\
43 - reinforce the door that holds up the knockers.\\
44 - You're staring at them, Alan.\\
45 - It's okay. I'm almost a doctor.\\
46 - Anyway, I've tried all that.\\
47 - It didn't help.\\
48 - Well, there is one other option, but it's kind of a last resort.\\
49 - What's that? Have you considered having breast reduction surgery?\\
50 - Something's wrong.\\
51 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
52 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
53 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
54 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
55 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
56 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
57 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
58 - * Men. *\\
59 - You see, they reshape the whole breast so you can't even tell.\\
60 - How long does it take to heal?\\
61 - Well, it says just a few weeks.\\
62 - You can keep Charlie off 'em for that long, can't you?\\
63 - I don't know.\\
64 - Might have to get some loaners.\\
65 - Morning.\\
66 - Morning. Morning.\\
67 - Oh, that is not good porn.\\
68 - It's not porn.\\
69 - It's a Web site about breast reduction surgery.\\
70 - Oh, Alan, you don't need surgery.\\
71 - A little exercise'll firm up those man boobs.\\
72 - Don't be silly, Charlie.\\
73 - Alan suggested it might be a solution for my back pain.\\
74 - Really?\\
75 - Alan made that suggestion?\\
76 - I just said it could help.\\
77 - I'll tell you what helps pain.\\
78 - Pain pills.\\
79 - In fact, I saw a guy on the news\\
80 - with a nail in his head,\\
81 - and thanks to pain pills, he was laughing.\\
82 - What about addiction?\\
83 - That's the least of his problems.\\
84 - He's got a nail in his head.\\
85 - Charlie. Kidding. Kidding.\\
86 - Look, I love your breasts just the way they are,\\
87 - but if you're in pain, you have my unconditional support\\
88 - to do whatever you have to do to feel better.\\
89 - Really?\\
90 - So you'd be okay with this?\\
91 - Sweetie, come on.\\
92 - I'm sure if you knew\\
93 - that the weight of my penis was causing me back problems,\\
94 - you'd be okay with me shaving off a few inches, right?\\
95 - I suppose.\\
96 - Of course, I've learned to deal with that pain,\\
97 - but that's my choice.\\
98 - Well, thank you for being so understanding.\\
99 - You don't have to thank me. I love you.\\
100 - I love you too.\\
101 - I'm gonna go get ready for work.\\
102 - I'll be up in a minute.\\
103 - Charlie, I gotta say, I think you handled that really...\\
104 - (shrieking)\\
105 - Are you out of your freakin' mind?\\
106 - My fingers!\\
107 - What are you doing sticking your nose\\
108 - in my fianc  e's breasts?\\
109 - I was just trying to help.\\
110 - Let's make one thing clear: the only acceptable\\
111 - boob reduction in this house is you moving out.\\
112 - Funny. Please, Charlie...\\
113 - I make my living with my hands.\\
114 - Really? Somebody's paying you to masturbate?\\
115 - (chuckling)\\
116 - Also funny.\\
117 - Don't I wish.\\
118 - Now, please stop now.\\
119 - I am duly chastised.\\
120 - Not good enough.\\
121 - You need to be punished.\\
122 - What?!\\
123 - I'm giving you a time out.\\
124 - What are you talking about?\\
125 - You've been very bad\\
126 - and you need to think about what you've done.\\
127 - Okay, fine. You want me to go to my room?\\
128 - Not far enough. Movies?\\
129 - Not long enough.\\
130 - What do you want me to do?\\
131 - I can't afford to stay in a hotel.\\
132 - Here.\\
133 - That's enough for two nights in a nice hotel\\
134 - or two months in an airport locker.\\
135 - I don't want your money.\\
136 - Fine. Go sleep in your car.\\
137 - Hold on.\\
138 - I'll just take a couple of bucks for gas, that's it.\\
139 - And meals. I have to eat.\\
140 - Tips and incidentals.\\
141 - * Men. *\\
142 - That feel good?\\
143 - (moans softly)\\
144 - Flavored oils.\\
145 - This one's...\\
146 - apple cinnamon.\\
147 - Nice.\\
148 - Want a lick?\\
149 - No, thanks.\\
150 - You sure?\\
151 - Tastes kind of like oily pie.\\
152 - I'll pass.\\
153 - Okay, more for me.\\
154 - You know, I appreciate this,\\
155 - but I don't think it's going to solve my back problems.\\
156 - Well, not right away.\\
157 - But if we do this enough, who knows?\\
158 - You might feel so much better, you'll want bigger boobs.\\
159 - I don't think so, Charlie.\\
160 - Fair enough.\\
161 - I want 'em bigger, you want 'em smaller.\\
162 - So we'll compromise and leave them just the way they are.\\
163 - God, I love that we can talk these things out.\\
164 - I made an appointment for a consultation\\
165 - with a plastic surgeon.\\
166 - What?\\
167 - The more I think about it, the more I think Alan's right.\\
168 - No-no-no, no, no. Alan's never right.\\
169 - Ask anybody.\\
170 - He's like an idiot savant without the savant part.\\
171 - I'm hoping you'll come with me for support.\\
172 - Hey, you can always count on me for support.\\
173 - I love you for who you are, not the size of your breasts.\\
174 - Thank you.\\
175 - Of course it goes both ways, you know.\\
176 - One of these days I'm gonna need you to love me for who I am,\\
177 - despite my old man balls.\\
178 - "Old man balls"?\\
179 - They get long, baby.\\
180 - Hey, don't throw away your D-cup bras.\\
181 - We may be able to re-purpose them.\\
182 - * Men. *\\
183 - (doorbell rings)\\
184 - (security camera whirring)\\
185 - EVELYN (over intercom): Hello?\\
186 - Hi, Mom.\\
187 - Oh, Alan. To what do I owe\\
188 - this unannounced and inconvenient pleasure?\\
189 - Uh, just hoping to ask for a favor.\\
190 - I see.\\
191 - Please tell me that there's\\
192 - a severed head in that bag and you want me to hide it.\\
193 - Nope, just socks and underwear.\\
194 - How many pair?\\
195 - Come on, Mom, don't make me beg.\\
196 - (sighs): All right.\\
197 - You know where the guest room is. (lock clicks, buzzes)\\
198 - Thank you.\\
199 - Uh, oh, uh, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.\\
200 - Not unless you want to talk to my gentleman friend.\\
201 - I was joking, Edgar. Don't stop.\\
202 - Good night, Alan.\\
203 - Night, Mom.\\
204 - Edgar.\\
205 - * Men. *\\
206 - Lord...\\
207 - you've blessed me with a lot:\\
208 - more money than I know what to do with,\\
209 - a beautiful home,\\
210 - and a surprisingly resilient liver.\\
211 - You have truly given unto me with both hands.\\
212 - Which brings me to my request.\\
213 - Of all the gifts you've bestowed upon me,\\
214 - none are a greater testament to your glory\\
215 - than Chelsea's heavenly breasts.\\
216 - I don't know why you couldn't have thrown in a sturdy spine\\
217 - so she could tote those things around,\\
218 - but who am I to question your methods?\\
219 - Anyway, you probably know that she's thinking about\\
220 - tampering with your great work, and I was just\\
221 - hoping that you could, you know, talk to her,\\
222 - return her to the path of righteousness...\\
223 - and bodaciousness.\\
224 - Amen.\\
225 - Oh, one more thing.\\
226 - I'm sorry we haven't talked recently, but I had\\
227 - a little crisis of faith after last year's Super Bowl.\\
228 - Water under the bridge.\\
229 - I got healthy on the NBA Finals.\\
230 - Nice work with Kobe, by the way.\\
231 - Looks like somebody missed their period again.\\
232 - * Men. *\\
233 - (scraping)\\
234 - (tapping)\\
235 - So, uh, where's Edgar?\\
236 - Oh, he didn't stay tonight.\\
237 - Kind of a booty call.\\
238 - More like a dine and dash.\\
239 - What'd you do to piss your brother off this time?\\
240 - Nothing. I-I just suggested\\
241 - that Chelsea's back pain might benefit\\
242 - from breast reduction surgery.\\
243 - You suggested\\
244 - that Charlie's fianc  e get smaller breasts?\\
245 - Yeah.\\
246 - While you're at it,\\
247 - why not try and reinstate Prohibition?\\
248 - Well, anyway, Charlie and I have decided\\
249 - to take a little break from each other,\\
250 - so I'll only be here a couple of days.\\
251 - Oh, Alan.\\
252 - I know I'm a little old to run home to mom.\\
253 - Believe me, if I had money for a hotel,\\
254 - I'd be there right now.\\
255 - Well, it's nice to know that my investment\\
256 - in chiropractor school was pesos well spent.\\
257 - Hey, you know,\\
258 - I-I think things are starting to look up.\\
259 - I feel like I'm at a real turning point, career-wise.\\
260 - You're an eternal optimist, aren't you, Alan?\\
261 - Yes. Yes, I am.\\
262 - Oh, that just breaks my heart.\\
263 - * Men. *\\
264 - So, we'd make an incision here...\\
265 - (deeply inhaling)\\
266 - (groans) And here...\\
267 - And one more here.\\
268 - Oh, God.\\
269 - Then we would remove some fatty tissue,\\
270 - reshape your breast and relocate the nipple.\\
271 - (groaning): Oh, not the nipples.\\
272 - I thought you were going to be supportive.\\
273 - I am being supportive.\\
274 - I just didn't know we were going to play Mr. Potato Head\\
275 - with our boobs.\\
276 - They're not our boobs, they're my breasts.\\
277 - Hey, if we were to dust 'em for prints right now,\\
278 - who's suspect number one?\\
279 - I take it you're not entirely on board with this.\\
280 - No, no, no, no, I'm trying.\\
281 - I mean, I don't want her to be in pain,\\
282 - but come on, look at those babies.\\
283 - They're perfect.\\
284 - The only way you could improve on 'em is\\
285 - if you could make 'em squirt money.\\
286 - Don't worry.\\
287 - They'll still be perfect when I'm done,\\
288 - except that your fianc  e will be pain-free.\\
289 - Hey, hey, I'm not questioning your abilities, Doc.\\
290 - In fact, I've been a big fan of your work for years.\\
291 - I mean, when you make 'em freakishly huge.\\
292 - Really?\\
293 - You know my work.\\
294 - Oh, yeah.\\
295 - I have an honorary lifetime membership\\
296 - at the Pussycat Palace.\\
297 - They named a pole after me.\\
298 - Uh-huh. You know, maybe\\
299 - it will help\\
300 - if you get a better sense of the end result.\\
301 - Yeah.\\
302 - This is Chelsea now.\\
303 - That's about right.\\
304 - And this is the size I'm recommending.\\
305 - Hmm.\\
306 - You got the one that goes with this?\\
307 - Sure.\\
308 - (gibbering)\\
309 - Nah, what else you got?\\
310 - * Men. *\\
311 - I, uh, I made you a cup of tea.\\
312 - Oh, thank you, dear.\\
313 - Whatcha doin'?\\
314 - Just finishing up some escrow paperwork.\\
315 - Inspector found no termite damage.\\
316 - Sign here, sweetie, where it says "inspector."\\
317 - Is that legal?\\
318 - Oh, don't worry about it.\\
319 - There are no termites.\\
320 - The mold killed them.\\
321 - Well, I guess you have to cut corners\\
322 - with the real estate market the way it is.\\
323 - True dat.\\
324 - Initial here, here, and here.\\
325 - More termite stuff?\\
326 - The less you know the better, dear.\\
327 - Listen, I was thinking when we're finished with this,\\
328 - we'd run over to Rodeo Drive\\
329 - and do a little clothes shopping. Oh! Rodeo Drive.\\
330 - That sounds fun.\\
331 - Do they have a Sears or a Kmart over there?\\
332 - Oh, don't worry about it.\\
333 - It's my treat.\\
334 - No, no, no, I'm a grown man.\\
335 - I can't have my mom buying me shirts, slacks,\\
336 - boxer briefs and possibly dress shoes.\\
337 - You're my son, Alan.\\
338 - I want nothing more than to see you happy.\\
339 - And not dressed like an unemployed lesbian.\\
340 - Now, give me your thumb.\\
341 - You've never been arrested, have you?\\
342 - * Men. *\\
343 - Berta, these fish sticks are great.\\
344 - Thank you.\\
345 - My secret is I take 'em out of the freezer.\\
346 - Well, kudos.\\
347 - Hey, where's my dad?\\
348 - (sighs)\\
349 - Damn it.\\
350 - Pay up.\\
351 - Thought for sure he'd stay oblivious until Monday.\\
352 - Well, "obliviously," you were wrong.\\
353 - Charlie, can I talk to you for a minute?\\
354 - What's up?\\
355 - Let's talk upstairs.\\
356 - Sure.\\
357 - Here's your cut.\\
358 - No, you didn't do anything wrong.\\
359 - Oh, cool.\\
360 - So what's up?\\
361 - You want a quickie?\\
362 - No.\\
363 - I just got a call from the plastic surgeon\\
364 - and they had a cancellation,\\
365 - so they can squeeze me in tomorrow morning.\\
366 - Tomorrow?\\
367 - But... that's so soon.\\
368 - Why put it off?\\
369 - Well, I was hoping we'd have time\\
370 - to go away for a few days.\\
371 - You know, one last fling,\\
372 - just the four of us.\\
373 - You've flung them plenty, Charlie.\\
374 - Oh, come on, just give me some more time.\\
375 - Time for what? Time to talk you out of this.\\
376 - You said you were going to support me.\\
377 - Yeah, but when do I get my support?\\
378 - What are you talking about?\\
379 - This decision affects both of us.\\
380 - I should get a vote.\\
381 - You're not the one in pain.\\
382 - (cries): Then why does it hurt so much?\\
383 - Oh, you're just making it worse!\\
384 - * Men. *\\
385 - I love my new silk jammies, Mom.\\
386 - It's like wearing a baby seal.\\
387 - Well, I'm glad you like them, dear.\\
388 - Oh, and I thought, tomorrow,\\
389 - I could take you to my hair stylist.\\
390 - Get you one of those hip, new spiky looks.\\
391 - Oh, that sounds like fun.\\
392 - Although I'm only two haircuts away\\
393 - from a free one at the barber college.\\
394 - Oh, nonsense.\\
395 - You deserve to be pampered a little bit.\\
396 - I kind of do, don't I?\\
397 - Yes, you do.\\
398 - I just have to be careful not to make you too attractive.\\
399 - (chuckles) I don't want to lose my fella to another gal.\\
400 - (chortles)\\
401 - Your fella. Funny.\\
402 - Well, I'm serious.\\
403 - You'll always be my fella.\\
404 - And I'll always be your best gal, right?\\
405 - Okay.\\
406 - And I've been thinking, this is a big house.\\
407 - And you and I are clearly not the marrying kind,\\
408 - so... why don't you just move in?\\
409 - Here?\\
410 - Sure. Why not?\\
411 - Can't you see how you and me\\
412 - are meant to be?\\
413 - Well, we're meant to be mother and son.\\
414 - That's a given.\\
415 - It's how we're livin'.\\
416 - Very clever.\\
417 - Of course, there is a certain\\
418 - financial imbalance.\\
419 - But I'm sure that we can\\
420 - come up with a plan that meets both of our needs.\\
421 - Plan? There's a, there's a plan?\\
422 - Of course there's a plan.\\
423 - I mean, I'm a vibrant woman now, Alan,\\
424 - but there will come a time when I won't be able\\
425 - to fend for myself and I don't want to pay some stranger\\
426 - to dress me and feed me and carry me to the bath,\\
427 - soap up a wash cloth\\
428 - and give me a good, thorough cleaning.\\
429 - Thanks, Mom! I'll call you.\\
430 - That should keep him away for a while.\\
431 - * Men. *\\
432 - (crying)\\
433 - Are you sure you're gonna be okay?\\
434 - I'm fine.\\
435 - Would you do me a little favor?\\
436 - What?\\
437 - Go like this.\\
438 - For old time's sake.\\
439 - NURSE: Chelsea?\\
440 - Ready for you. Oh, God, this is it.\\
441 - Take a deep breath, Charlie.\\
442 - I will if you will.\\
443 - It's still gonna be me, just a little smaller.\\
444 - I know.\\
445 - I guess the good news is\\
446 - it'll draw more attention to your backside.\\
447 - What?\\
448 - You know, with your breasts smaller,\\
449 - the eye will naturally go to your ample tush.\\
450 - Are you saying my ass is too big?\\
451 - No, no, no, I love your ass.\\
452 - I'm just saying with smaller boobs,\\
453 - more people will notice it.\\
454 - Are you insane?\\
455 - I don't want people noticing my ass.\\
456 - Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't kill the messenger.\\
457 - It's the first law of landscaping.\\
458 - If you trim down the tree, the backyard looks bigger.\\
459 - Am I right?\\
460 - Damn you, Charlie Harper.\\
461 - What? Tell the doctor I changed my mind.\\
462 - What did I say?\\
463 - Where are you going? Home.\\
464 - What about your back pain?\\
465 - I'll live with it. Are you sure?\\
466 - I live with you, don't I?\\
467 - Come on.\\
468 - How about that?\\
469 - Thank you, Lord.\\
470 - You speaketh through me.

1 - * Men. *\\
2 - Who wants more potatoes?\\
3 - Hit me.\\
4 - Uh, Chelsea, the way it's supposed to work here\\
5 - is that Berta serves us dinner.\\
6 - I don't mind.\\
7 - Hear that? She doesn't mind.\\
8 - Shut up.\\
9 - EVELYN: We're back!\\
10 - Hey, how'd it go?\\
11 - I don't know what you were worried about.\\
12 - Your son is a wonderful driver.\\
13 - Oh, well, thanks for taking him, Mom.\\
14 - He needs the practice.\\
15 - Mmm, pork chops.\\
16 - What are you wearing?\\
17 - Grandma bought it for me.\\
18 - Pretty cool, huh?\\
19 - You made him dress up as a chauffeur?\\
20 - He loves it.\\
21 - Don't get grease on that jacket, dear.\\
22 - Yes, Miss Evelyn.\\
23 - Would you like to join us for dinner?\\
24 - Oh, no, thanks, I had a late lunch.\\
25 - And she sent a piece of pie out to the car,\\
26 - so I could eat, too.\\
27 - Anyway, I better get going.\\
28 - Well, thanks again, Mom.\\
29 - Say thanks to Grandma.\\
30 - Thank you, Miss Evelyn.\\
31 - Good to see you. You, too.\\
32 - Oh, I almost forgot.\\
33 - Have you two set a wedding date yet?\\
34 - No.\\
35 - We haven't.\\
36 - But we're gonna.\\
37 - Well, it just so happens that a client of mine\\
38 - schedules the weddings for the Bel Air Hotel,\\
39 - and she told me that there was a cancellation\\
40 - for the weekend of June 26.\\
41 - The Bel Air Hotel? In June.\\
42 - Charlie, the Bel Air Hotel.\\
43 - In June.\\
44 - Yeah, I heard.\\
45 - Wow.\\
46 - What do ya think?\\
47 - Gee, I don't know.\\
48 - We hadn't talked about a date.\\
49 - Boy, it's almost impossible\\
50 - to get a June date at the Bel Air Hotel.\\
51 - Thank you, Alan.\\
52 - Judith and I had to get married at the Sportsmen's Lodge\\
53 - in November on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.\\
54 - Yes, I remember the Indian corn centerpieces.\\
55 - Oh, Charlie, I've always dreamed of getting married\\
56 - at the Bel Air in the garden with the swans.\\
57 - Yeah, but keep in mind those birds are vicious.\\
58 - They look pretty, but they'll peck your eye right out.\\
59 - Besides, I thought if we had the wedding here,\\
60 - the money we save could pay for a nice long honeymoon.\\
61 - Yeah, I guess that's probably smarter.\\
62 - Shame on you, Charles.\\
63 - Depriving your fianc  e of her dream wedding.\\
64 - Especially considering all the money you blew\\
65 - on hooch and whores over the years.\\
66 - Thank you, Berta.\\
67 - Tell you what--\\
68 - the wedding at the Bel Air will be my gift to you.\\
69 - Are you serious?\\
70 - Gee, Mom, thanks, but that's a little too generous.\\
71 - A little?! All she gave Judith and me\\
72 - was a dinette set.\\
73 - Yes, and who's eating on that dinette set now?\\
74 - That's not the point.\\
75 - Charlie's marriage is just as likely to fail as mine was.\\
76 - Thanks again, bro.\\
77 - Anyway,\\
78 - I asked them to hold the date for 24 hours.\\
79 - So you can talk it over and decide.\\
80 - Thank you, Evelyn. That is so sweet.\\
81 - Well, I do have an ulterior motive.\\
82 - The sooner you two get married,\\
83 - the sooner I'll have more grandchildren.\\
84 - Why? Does Miss Evelyn need a cook\\
85 - and a butler, too?\\
86 - Let me know, dear.\\
87 - I will.\\
88 - The Bel Air Hotel.\\
89 - In June.\\
90 - Let's see ya get out of this one, Houdini.\\
91 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
92 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
93 - * Men. *\\
94 - So, have you thought about your mother's offer?\\
95 - Yeah, I have.\\
96 - I've got one question.\\
97 - Why June?\\
98 - What's wrong with getting married in July?\\
99 - Or the following October?\\
100 - October is a perfectly good month.\\
101 - Birds all fly south,\\
102 - so you don't have to worry about swan attacks.\\
103 - Charlie, if you don't want to get married in June,\\
104 - we don't have to.\\
105 - What? No, no.\\
106 - No, that's not what I'm saying at all.\\
107 - Where do you get this stuff?\\
108 - So?\\
109 - So, what?\\
110 - Do you want to get married in June?\\
111 - Oh, we're back on that.\\
112 - Well, I can't think of any good reason why not.\\
113 - And believe me, I'm trying.\\
114 - So that's it?\\
115 - We're getting married June 26 at the Bel Air Hotel?\\
116 - I guess so.\\
117 - Oh, Charlie, I'm so happy.\\
118 - That's only because you don't have a swan beak\\
119 - in your eye socket yet.\\
120 - I'm going to go call your mom,\\
121 - and then my mom and then all my friends.\\
122 - Good, good.\\
123 - Alan, we're going to do it.\\
124 - June 26 at the Bel Air Hotel.\\
125 - (squealing): Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!\\
126 - That's so wonderful!\\
127 - I know! I gotta go call everybody.\\
128 - Congratulations.\\
129 - Thanks.\\
130 - Wow, the end of an era.\\
131 - Guess so.\\
132 - Well, you had a good run.\\
133 - Yep.\\
134 - But now it's over.\\
135 - (whispering): Forever.\\
136 - Nothing's going to change, Alan.\\
137 - Sure, I'm going to be married,\\
138 - but I'm still going to be the same guy\\
139 - living in the same house with the same woman.\\
140 - Yes, yes, the same woman.\\
141 - (whispering): Forever.\\
142 - Hey, can I be the best man?\\
143 - You'll need a sex change.\\
144 - Where you going?\\
145 - Out for a drink.\\
146 - You can drink here.\\
147 - I could, but I don't want to vomit here.\\
148 - Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.\\
149 - Why? I'm not done poking at you.\\
150 - Hey, shouldn't you ask the ol' ball and chain first?\\
151 - I don't need her permission.\\
152 - Really? Yes, really.\\
153 - Although, it is considerate\\
154 - to let your partner know your plans,\\
155 - so she won't worry.\\
156 - Sweetie, I'm going out for a drink with Alan, okay?\\
157 - CHELSEA: Sure! Have fun!\\
158 - Thanks! Love you!\\
159 - Shut up.\\
160 - You're driving.\\
161 - Wow.\\
162 - Jake has one big-ass head.\\
163 - * Men. *\\
164 - All kidding aside, she's a great girl\\
165 - and I'm sure you're going to be very happy.\\
166 - Thanks.\\
167 - (whispering): Forever.\\
168 - Are you done poking?\\
169 - For the moment.\\
170 - Boy, who would've figured that of the two of us\\
171 - I'd end up being the carefree bachelor?\\
172 - If by carefree, you mean broke and lonely,\\
173 - everybody would've figured.\\
174 - Hi.\\
175 - Hi.\\
176 - Charlie. Betsy.\\
177 - I'm getting married on June 26.\\
178 - Good for you.\\
179 - At the Bel Air Hotel.\\
180 - Nice!\\
181 - That means no matter how easy you are,\\
182 - I can't sleep with you.\\
183 - I can. I'm Alan.\\
184 - Can he buy you a drink?\\
185 - * Men. *\\
186 - (music playing over TV)\\
187 - What you watching?\\
188 - Um! Golf!\\
189 - Don't sneak up on a guy, all right?\\
190 - Sorry.\\
191 - Your dad watches a lot of golf, too.\\
192 - So, listen,\\
193 - how'd you like to be a groomsman in the wedding?\\
194 - What do I gotta do?\\
195 - You just walk down the aisle with one of the bridesmaids\\
196 - and stand with Charlie during the ceremony.\\
197 - (mutes audio) Tell me more about the bridesmaids.\\
198 - They're friends of mine.\\
199 - So, they're old.\\
200 - No, not all of them.\\
201 - I have a niece who's about your age.\\
202 - Is she pretty?\\
203 - I think she's cute.\\
204 - Okay, I know what that means.\\
205 - She's not a brainiac, is she?\\
206 - What does that mean?\\
207 - Well, I don't like 'em stupid,\\
208 - but I don't like 'em talkin' down to me either.\\
209 - Got it.\\
210 - And I like a little junk in the trunk.\\
211 - You won't be disappointed.\\
212 - All right, I'm in.\\
213 - (TV audio resumes) Great.\\
214 - ANNOUNCER: ...with about 200 yards...\\
215 - You know, of all the women my uncle's been with,\\
216 - you're my favorite.\\
217 - Oh, thank you.\\
218 - And there's been a lot.\\
219 - I know.\\
220 - A whole lot.\\
221 - Right.\\
222 - Like, I'm betting around a thousand.\\
223 - Uh-huh.\\
224 - And that's just since I've been old enough to pay attention.\\
225 - No kidding.\\
226 - When I first got here, he told me\\
227 - that they were coming over to water the plants.\\
228 - And I believed him.\\
229 - What did I know?\\
230 - Sure. You were young.\\
231 - And naive, too.\\
232 - We didn't have any plants.\\
233 - And there were some crazy ones, too.\\
234 - I'll bet.\\
235 - Your niece doesn't have a license\\
236 - to carry a concealed weapon, does she?\\
237 - No.\\
238 - Good.\\
239 - You should've seen where this one girl hid hers.\\
240 - * Men. *\\
241 - (slurred): Come to find out\\
242 - that what I thought was a boil on my neck\\
243 - was actually a carbuncle.\\
244 - Lovely.\\
245 - Little known fact, uh,\\
246 - carbuncles are technically in the boil family,\\
247 - but they take way longer to drain.\\
248 - Charlie, help me here. I'm dying.\\
249 - No, you're doing fine.\\
250 - Tell her about your hemorrhoids.\\
251 - Please, I'm begging you.\\
252 - All right.\\
253 - No sense letting my superpowers go to waste.\\
254 - (clears throat)\\
255 - So, Dr. Harper,\\
256 - are we still going to Sun Valley\\
257 - in your Gulf Stream this weekend?\\
258 - You own your own trailer?\\
259 - No, no, no, that's an Airstream.\\
260 - Dr. Harper has a private jet.\\
261 - Really?\\
262 - Oh, yeah.\\
263 - He needs one for his work.\\
264 - Hmm.\\
265 - What do you do?\\
266 - Uh, I am a chiropractor.\\
267 - A chiropractor without borders.\\
268 - He travels the world\\
269 - adjusting the backs of starving children.\\
270 - ALAN: Yes, you...\\
271 - you have to be, uh, very careful, um,\\
272 - because their little bones are very brittle.\\
273 - Wow.\\
274 - You're amazing.\\
275 - Nah, it's just my job.\\
276 - (chuckles)\\
277 - (whispering): You're amazing.\\
278 - It wasn't tough.\\
279 - We had her at trailer.\\
280 - Uh, another round. On him.\\
281 - * Men. *\\
282 - (softly grunts)\\
283 - (chuckles)\\
284 - Uh-oh.\\
285 - * Men. *\\
286 - * Men. *\\
287 - (whispering): Charlie...\\
288 - Charlie?!\\
289 - Go away, Alan.\\
290 - (whispering): I really think you need to wake up now.\\
291 - Shh.\\
292 - Chelsea's sleeping.\\
293 - Perhaps, but not here.\\
294 - Okay, what the hell is your prob...?\\
295 - Oh, dear.\\
296 - (whispers): What happened?\\
297 - I don't know.\\
298 - Who is she?\\
299 - I don't know.\\
300 - What the hell do you know, Alan?\\
301 - I know we're in a strange woman's bed,\\
302 - together, naked.\\
303 - (thudding)\\
304 - Let's get the hell out of here.\\
305 - Good idea.\\
306 - Do you remember anything?\\
307 - Well, I remember we were in Pavlov's.\\
308 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
309 - You were hitting on some chick.\\
310 - Guess it worked.\\
311 - Do you happen to remember how I did it?\\
312 - Alan, focus.\\
313 - Okay, right, right.\\
314 - I-I think there was something about a-a trailer in Sun Valley.\\
315 - Are we in Idaho?\\
316 - No mountains, no snow.\\
317 - Thank God.\\
318 - Why are you wearing my underwear?\\
319 - Why are you wearing mine?\\
320 - Oh, boy.\\
321 - Let's just go.\\
322 - Should we leave her a little note?\\
323 - What?!\\
324 - You know, a thank you, maybe my phone number.\\
325 - Are you crazy?! Just keep moving!\\
326 - But she's cute, and I'm gonna need\\
327 - a plus one for your wedding.\\
328 - Oh, my God, my wedding.\\
329 - You're right, it could be awkward.\\
330 - * Men. *\\
331 - What have I done, Alan?\\
332 - Less than 24 hours after I set a date for my wedding,\\
333 - I wake up in bed with another woman.\\
334 - And me.\\
335 - You woke up in bed with me, too.\\
336 - (singing "The Stripper")\\
337 - What the hell did we do last night?\\
338 - I wish I knew.\\
339 - What am I gonna tell Chelsea?\\
340 - Well, let-let's think.\\
341 - I mean, maybe there's an innocent explanation.\\
342 - Oh, really? And what might that be?\\
343 - Okay, clearly, we all had a bit much to drink.\\
344 - Yeah. And you and I,\\
345 - being gentlemen, escorted the lady home.\\
346 - Mm-hmm.\\
347 - She invited us in\\
348 - for a cup of coffee to sober up.\\
349 - Was that before or after we switched underwear?\\
350 - Let me finish.\\
351 - Uh, so, we went into her apartment and...\\
352 - I don't know what you're gonna tell Chelsea.\\
353 - Here is what you tell her.\\
354 - Tell her you were detained by the secret police,\\
355 - strip-searched and water-boarded.\\
356 - Just drive.\\
357 - Worked for me.\\
358 - All right.\\
359 - Here's what we're gonna do.\\
360 - We're gonna forget this night ever happened.\\
361 - Good idea.\\
362 - Giddy-up horsey, giddy-up.\\
363 - (neighing)\\
364 - Of course, that may be easier said than done.\\
365 - * Men. *\\
366 - (whispers): Great.\\
367 - No one's up yet.\\
368 - All right, go to bed.\\
369 - I'll see you later.\\
370 - Charlie?\\
371 - What?\\
372 - You want your boxers back?\\
373 - You keep 'em.\\
374 - Really? Gee, thanks.\\
375 - Oh, oh, Charlie?! Charlie?\\
376 - Yeah?\\
377 - Uh, if I put 'em in the laundry,\\
378 - Berta will wash them and give them back to you.\\
379 - Then hand-wash 'em.\\
380 - Of course.\\
381 - Charlie?! Charlie?!\\
382 - What?\\
383 - Woolite or a mild detergent?\\
384 - I don't care.\\
385 - All right, no worries. I'll check the label.\\
386 - Oh, Charlie?\\
387 - What?\\
388 - Thanks for taking me out with you tonight.\\
389 - I had a really good time.\\
390 - (sighs)\\
391 - (clattering)\\
392 - CHELSEA: Charlie?\\
393 - Yeah, babe?\\
394 - Are you just getting home?\\
395 - No, no... no, I was a little drunk,\\
396 - so I slept downstairs for a while.\\
397 - I didn't want to disturb you.\\
398 - Did you have a good time with Alan?\\
399 - Oh, come on, it was Alan.\\
400 - How much fun could I have had?\\
401 - * Happy birthday\\
402 - * Mr. President\\
403 - * Happy birthday\\
404 - * To you.\\
405 - Oh, you don't mean that.\\
406 - No, no.\\
407 - We had an okay time.\\
408 - Pretty forgettable.\\
409 - I talked to my parents last night.\\
410 - They are so excited.\\
411 - Not as excited as me.\\
412 - I'm gonna make you a great wife, Charlie Harper.\\
413 - I know.\\
414 - And I'm gonna...\\
415 - cut down on my drinking.\\
416 - * Men. *\\
417 - Boy, I don't know, Chels.\\
418 - I really like the white roses for the centerpieces.\\
419 - You don't think it's too much?\\
420 - No. No.\\
421 - The rose symbolizes love, and white symbolizes, you know,\\
422 - the cleanness of that love.\\
423 - Cleanness?\\
424 - Yeah, yeah, like purity or...\\
425 - untainted by filth.\\
426 - A white rose is a rose you can trust.\\
427 - And making it the centerpiece is appropriate\\
428 - because you're my centerpiece.\\
429 - You know, the piece that supercedes all other pieces.\\
430 - Are you still drunk?\\
431 - Only with love.\\
432 - (phone ringing)\\
433 - Oh, it's my grandmother.\\
434 - Hi, Grammy!\\
435 - Yeah, it's gonna be a June wedding.\\
436 - Excuse me.\\
437 - That's a terrible thing to say, Grammy.\\
438 - Besides, I said "June," not "Jew."\\
439 - Okay, what've you done?\\
440 - Beg your pardon?\\
441 - That sweet, naive hick you're marrying might buy\\
442 - this loving, cooperative attitude, but not your mommy.\\
443 - Hey, can't a fella just be excited\\
444 - about floral centerpieces?\\
445 - A gay fella.\\
446 - You're feeling guilty about something.\\
447 - What is it?\\
448 - Nothing. I've got nothing to feel guilty about.\\
449 - Okay, okay, okay, now you give him your underwear.\\
450 - Charlie...?\\
451 - I'm not really sure what I did.\\
452 - So, a drunken escapade?\\
453 - Is there another kind of escapade?\\
454 - Well, whatever you do, don't tell Chelsea about it.\\
455 - Confession may be good for the soul,\\
456 - but it's a hot lead enema to a marriage.\\
457 - I know, I know,\\
458 - but I've got these freaky memory flashes,\\
459 - and I feel so guilty.\\
460 - Trust me... those memories will fade with time.\\
461 - How do you know?\\
462 - Let me tell you a story.\\
463 - Many years ago,\\
464 - The carpet king?\\
465 - Well, I called him that.\\
466 - Wasn't his occupation.\\
467 - Anyway, he was away on business,\\
468 - and you and your brother were in summer camp or somewhere,\\
469 - and I...\\
470 - Well, I was lonely, bored\\
471 - and the circus was in town.\\
472 - And when I woke up in that Motel 6,\\
473 - clown makeup smeared all over my bosom,\\
474 - I was alone.\\
475 - The Chinese acrobats, the strong man\\
476 - and the little people had moved on to the next town.\\
477 - Oh, my God!\\
478 - What did you do then?\\
479 - Well, what could I do?\\
480 - I showered, plucked the sequins from my hoo-hoo...\\
481 - ...held my head up, got on with my life.\\
482 - And you never told the carpet king?\\
483 - No, of course not.\\
484 - I loved him too much.\\
485 - Your second stepfather was the third best thing\\
486 - that ever happened to me.\\
487 - Behind me and Alan?\\
488 - Sure.\\
489 - * Men. *\\
490 - I think some teenagers are fooling around\\
491 - under the deck again.\\
492 - Really?\\
493 - Yeah, I found a pair of men's briefs by the side of the house.\\
494 - Damn kids.\\
495 - No respect for anything.\\
496 - (sighs)\\
497 - Listen, Chels...\\
498 - we need to talk.\\
499 - Something wrong?\\
500 - Yeah.\\
501 - What is it?\\
502 - I got these... these pictures in my head,\\
503 - and I'm afraid if I don't tell you about them,\\
504 - they're gonna drive me crazy.\\
505 - Go ahead.\\
506 - (sighs)\\
507 - Well, what happened was...\\
508 - ...my second stepfather went on a business trip\\
509 - while the circus was in town.\\
510 - Alan and I were at camp--\\
511 - or someplace--\\
512 - and my mother was lonely....\\
513 - * Men. *\\
514 - (calliope music playing)\\
515 - Shouldn't we leave her a note? Just keep walking.
\subsection {Episode 08: Gorp. Fnark. Schmegle.}
1 - So, do either of you guys urinate with abnormal frequency?\\
2 - No.\\
3 - I mean, you gotta define abnormal.\\
4 - And keep in mind the body\\
5 - doesn't process alcohol efficiently.\\
6 - Which is why your Uncle Charlie\\
7 - is a perpetual urine machine.\\
8 - Also keep in mind that your father\\
9 - has the bladder control\\
10 - of a frightened nine-year-old girl.\\
11 - Which is why he needs to wear\\
12 - two pairs of undies and a panty liner.\\
13 - Only on long drives.\\
14 - Oh, really?\\
15 - How many times a night do you get up to pee?\\
16 - Just once.\\
17 - I can hear your toilet flush, Alan.\\
18 - Okay, four times.\\
19 - But at least I get out of bed to pee.\\
20 - Hey, hey.\\
21 - That was an isolated incident.\\
22 - I was dreaming my shoes were on fire.\\
23 - Does that answer your question, buddy?\\
24 - Yeah.\\
25 - And remind me to never ask another one.\\
26 - Charlie? Yeah?\\
27 - Why aren't you ready?\\
28 - Ready for...?\\
29 - You've got to be kidding me.\\
30 - I've told you at least three times\\
31 - we're having dinner with my girlfriend Gail tonight.\\
32 - Excuse me, gotta pee.\\
33 - I swear to God, you never listen\\
34 - when I'm talking to you.\\
35 - It's like you just tune me out.\\
36 - You look like you're paying attention,\\
37 - but your mind is a million miles away.\\
38 - CHARLIE: Do I need to pee?\\
39 - Nah.\\
40 - I mean, I could.\\
41 - Might be traffic.\\
42 - Probably should pee.\\
43 - Yeah, better pee.\\
44 - Now we're going to be late, and I'm going\\
45 - to be embarrassed all because you don't listen.\\
46 - Boy, she's got great boobies.\\
47 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
48 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
49 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
50 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh... *\\
51 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
52 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
53 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
54 - * Men. *\\
55 - So, Charlie, I've heard so many nice things about you.\\
56 - Really? From who?\\
57 - Hello.\\
58 - Oh, right.\\
59 - Thanks.\\
60 - I guess I only hear the complaints.\\
61 - You don't hear anything.\\
62 - That's not true.\\
63 - You're right. It's not.\\
64 - He hears what he wants to hear.\\
65 - So I'm right.\\
66 - Well, you still make a great couple. Thank you.\\
67 - And I'm really looking forward to your wedding.\\
68 - (choking up): I'm sure it's going to be beautiful.\\
69 - (whispering): What'd I do?\\
70 - Nothing. I told you she's going through a bad breakup.\\
71 - When did you tell me that?\\
72 - In the car, on the way here.\\
73 - God.\\
74 - It's going to be okay.\\
75 - I know. It's just hard.\\
76 - I thought I knew him.\\
77 - I thought we were going to be together forever,\\
78 - like you and Charlie. (sobs)\\
79 - CHARLIE: Hard to believe somebody got tired of doing her.\\
80 - Ooh, French fries look good.\\
81 - Why did I order the baked potato?\\
82 - Isn't that right, Charlie? Absolutely.\\
83 - Now, is this the one who's the old college roommate?\\
84 - I should really listen more.\\
85 - I mean, I knew he was insensitive...\\
86 - Boy, I bet, if they were roommates,\\
87 - they did some experimenting.\\
88 - Why is it that girls can experiment with other girls\\
89 - and not be gay, but if a guy\\
90 - so as much kisses another guy-- woop, bad memory.\\
91 - Drink... drink, drink, drink.\\
92 - So you're just all alone in that big apartment?\\
93 - He even took the dog.\\
94 - Bastard.\\
95 - What? It's my first drink.\\
96 - Not you.\\
97 - Brian took Rufus.\\
98 - Oh.\\
99 - Who's Rufus?\\
100 - For that matter, who's Brian?\\
101 - Life of Brian-- that was pretty funny.\\
102 - Brian's Song, not so much.\\
103 - James Caan was great in it, though.\\
104 - That's 'cause he's a great actor.\\
105 - The Godfather, Rollerball...\\
106 - Yeah, I can so see these two kissing in a dorm room.\\
107 - That's really sweet, but I couldn't impose.\\
108 - We insist.\\
109 - Right, Charlie? Absolutely.\\
110 - CHELSEA: There.\\
111 - You'll come stay with us for a few days and heal.\\
112 - I don't know what to say.\\
113 - Say yes.\\
114 - Um... yes.\\
115 - Good.\\
116 - After dinner, we can go back to her apartment\\
117 - so she can pack a bag. Absolutely.\\
118 - You'll love Charlie's place.\\
119 - It's right on the sand.\\
120 - Very quiet, restful.\\
121 - Dear Penthouse Forum...\\
122 - I always thought your letters were made up,\\
123 - until my fianc  e's college roommate\\
124 - came to stay with us for a few days.\\
125 - Right, Charlie?\\
126 - Absolutely.\\
127 - * Men. *\\
128 - (electric razor buzzing)\\
129 - Hey, Alan?\\
130 - Alan?\\
131 - (razor turns off)\\
132 - ALAN: Be right there.\\
133 - What's up? (clears throat)\\
134 - What were you doing?\\
135 - Um, shaving.\\
136 - At night?\\
137 - Well, not so much shaving as... trimming.\\
138 - So, uh, how was dinner?\\
139 - Forget dinner.\\
140 - Please tell me you weren't using my razor.\\
141 - Mine doesn't have the floating heads.\\
142 - I don't believe you.\\
143 - I put that thing on my face.\\
144 - I was going to clean it before I gave it back.\\
145 - I-I don't want it back!\\
146 - Really?\\
147 - Yeah. Yeah, it's yours.\\
148 - Merry Christmas.\\
149 - Thank you.\\
150 - But this is just a stocking stuffer, right?\\
151 - I mean, you are going to get me a real present, too.\\
152 - A real present?\\
153 - Well, you obviously didn't put much thought into this one.\\
154 - Good night, Alan.\\
155 - Good night.\\
156 - Oh, I almost forgot.\\
157 - Pack up your stuff and get out.\\
158 - Okay, okay, the razor can be my Christmas present.\\
159 - No, no, no, Chelsea's girlfriend is staying here for a few days,\\
160 - so you're going to sleep on the couch.\\
161 - Why don't you put her in Jake's room\\
162 - and have Jake sleep on the couch?\\
163 - Fair question. Why don't you trim\\
164 - your ball hair with a steak knife?\\
165 - * Men. *\\
166 - I feel bad kicking your brother out of his room.\\
167 - Well, that's only because you don't know him.\\
168 - A little chamomile tea, help you sleep.\\
169 - Chelsea, I can't thank you enough.\\
170 - Don't be silly.\\
171 - I know what it feels like to have my heart broken.\\
172 - Me, too.\\
173 - You know, theoretically.\\
174 - Well, I'm grateful to you both.\\
175 - And we're grateful to you.\\
176 - You know, theoretically.\\
177 - Anyway, tomorrow, you can sleep in,\\
178 - take a nice, long walk on the beach...\\
179 - CHARLIE: I've been a really good boyfriend tonight.\\
180 - Chelsea should do something nice for me.\\
181 - Like make out with Gail.\\
182 - Okay, I put fresh sheets on the bed.\\
183 - Alan, this is my friend Gail.\\
184 - Gail, this is Alan.\\
185 - I'm so sorry to put you out like this,\\
186 - (fading out): but your brother said...\\
187 - ALAN: Gorp.Fnark. Schmegle.\\
188 - Oh, God, I've been waiting for you all my life.\\
189 - (no audio)\\
190 - Marry me. Have my children.\\
191 - (no audio)\\
192 - ...It's really very generous of you.\\
193 - Gorp.\\
194 - Fnark.\\
195 - Schmegle.\\
196 - Come on, I'll show you the room.\\
197 - (humming "Here Comes the Bride" in head)\\
198 - (humming funky guitar line in head)\\
199 - Chelsea?\\
200 - Chelsea?\\
201 - (woman crying)\\
202 - (crying continues)\\
203 - Chels, you in there?\\
204 - CHELSEA: It's okay, Charlie.\\
205 - Come on in.\\
206 - (crying)\\
207 - Everything all right?\\
208 - She's pretty upset.\\
209 - I'm sorry I'm such a basket case.\\
210 - Oh, please.\\
211 - We're here for you, baby.\\
212 - Right, Charlie?\\
213 - Absolutely.\\
214 - I guess I'll... leave you two alone.\\
215 - You don't have to go.\\
216 - I don't?\\
217 - Not unless you want to.\\
218 - CHARLIE: Gorp.\\
219 - Fnark. Schmegle.\\
220 - Come on, Charlie.\\
221 - We all know what you really want to do.\\
222 - We do?\\
223 - We do.\\
224 - Come here. Join us.\\
225 - Uh, okay.\\
226 - So... what now?\\
227 - Do I really need to tell you?\\
228 - We'd probably be better off if you did.\\
229 - Okay.\\
230 - I want you to make Gail happy.\\
231 - And you're on board?\\
232 - It was my idea.\\
233 - Don't worry-- she and I have done this before.\\
234 - In college.\\
235 - I knew it.\\
236 - Okay, let's turn that frown upside down.\\
237 - That's a good boy.\\
238 - Hey, Chels? Yeah, babe?\\
239 - This is a dream, right?\\
240 - Of course it's a dream.\\
241 - You think I'm really gonna let you sleep with my best friend?\\
242 - Well, in that case, hang on.\\
243 - 'Cause I'm gonna do some real freaky stuff here.\\
244 - * Men. *\\
245 - Yowza.\\
246 - Excuse me.\\
247 - I brought you some fresh towels, Gail.\\
248 - Oh, aren't you sweet.\\
249 - Sure, sweet.\\
250 - Go smell his room.\\
251 - Morning.\\
252 - Good, you're up.\\
253 - I made you some toast.\\
254 - Here's your orange juice.\\
255 - Oh, thank you, honey.\\
256 - I'll see you later.\\
257 - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you're leaving?\\
258 - I told you I have to go in to work today.\\
259 - But what about Gail?\\
260 - She can take care of herself.\\
261 - I think she's already made a new friend.\\
262 - Yeah, I saw.\\
263 - You don't think he's got a shot, do you?\\
264 - Charlie, you're horrible.\\
265 - I was joking.\\
266 - So how long are you going to be gone?\\
267 - I'll be home for dinner-- I thought maybe\\
268 - I'd pick up some Chinese food,\\
269 - and we could stay in and... Is she nuts?\\
270 - I can't be trusted alone with that chick.\\
271 - Wait, maybe this is a test.\\
272 - A trap.\\
273 - The two of them are in cahoots\\
274 - to find out if I'll make a move.\\
275 - Cahoots, that's a funny word.\\
276 - Sounds like an owl sneezing.\\
277 - Ca-ca-ca-cahoots!\\
278 - So, I'll call you later.\\
279 - Absolutely.\\
280 - Morning, Alan.\\
281 - Oh, uh, morning.\\
282 - Thank you again for letting Gail have your room.\\
283 - Oh, don't be silly. Happy to do it.\\
284 - Uh, mi casa, her casa.\\
285 - It's actually his casa,\\
286 - but the dehumidifier and the night-light belong to me.\\
287 - Still very nice of you.\\
288 - See ya later.\\
289 - What you got going on today?\\
290 - Going to play a little tennis in 1958?\\
291 - This old thing?\\
292 - This is just my knock-around clothes.\\
293 - So, what's the story on Gail?\\
294 - Bad breakup?\\
295 - Something like that.\\
296 - So, she's on the rebound.\\
297 - Where you going with this, Alan?\\
298 - Oh, nowhere, I'm just curious about her.\\
299 - And, you know, when we met last night,\\
300 - I-I sensed a little spark between us.\\
301 - If there was a spark,\\
302 - it's only 'cause she was warming up her Taser.\\
303 - Ha-ha, very funny.\\
304 - Alan, trust me, the only way you're gonna\\
305 - hook up with someone like Gail is in your dreams.\\
306 - Already did.\\
307 - Really? Was Chelsea there?\\
308 - No! Good Lord! How creepy would that be?\\
309 - Well, regardless, forget about Gail.\\
310 - Potato head out there has a better shot than you do.\\
311 - You know, I've got a nephew about your age.\\
312 - You should meet him. He plays guitar, too.\\
313 - Maybe you guys could jam sometime.\\
314 - Oh... boobies.\\
315 - (no audio)\\
316 - Hey, for your information,\\
317 - there is a very good chance that a woman like that\\
318 - is tired of rich, handsome, successful guys\\
319 - who have their own homes and recently built cars.\\
320 - You really believe that?\\
321 - I have to.\\
322 - Woof!\\
323 - Who's that?\\
324 - Chelsea's friend.\\
325 - She's going through a bad breakup\\
326 - so she's going to stay here for a few days...\\
327 - Hmph! Too bad I prefer the fellas.\\
328 - Then again, I can always draw a moustache on her.\\
329 - * Men. *\\
330 - (crying)\\
331 - Alan?\\
332 - Jake?\\
333 - Berta?\\
334 - (crying continues)\\
335 - Oh, boy.\\
336 - Although, maybe this is another dream.\\
337 - (sniffling)\\
338 - Gail, you okay?\\
339 - (crying): I'm fine.\\
340 - Good. Good.\\
341 - I'm going to run some errands.\\
342 - Can I get you anything while I'm out?\\
343 - A reason to live.\\
344 - All righty.\\
345 - (crying continues)\\
346 - Coming in.\\
347 - (crying continues)\\
348 - Sorry.\\
349 - I just got some bad news.\\
350 - What happened?\\
351 - My boyfriend...\\
352 - Rufus?\\
353 - That's my dog.\\
354 - Oh, yeah.\\
355 - He's okay, right?\\
356 - He's fine.\\
357 - I just found out Brian is already seeing someone else.\\
358 - No.\\
359 - I mean, we just broke up\\
360 - and he's already sleeping with another woman?\\
361 - The pig!\\
362 - I thought we had something.\\
363 - (sniffling)\\
364 - He always said I was his soul mate\\
365 - and that he wanted to spend the rest\\
366 - of his life with me...\\
367 - This can't be a dream.\\
368 - She's still got her clothes on.\\
369 - And she's talking.\\
370 - Why can't I find a nice guy like you?\\
371 - Absolutely.\\
372 - Maybe Chelsea would let me borrow you.\\
373 - (wry chuckle)\\
374 - Excuse me, gotta pee.\\
375 - Oh, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.\\
376 - Here you go. Thanks.\\
377 - I don't know how much longer I can hold out.\\
378 - I hear you.\\
379 - What?\\
380 - Nothing.\\
381 - I gotta get Gail out of here\\
382 - before I do something I'm going to regret.\\
383 - You know, after I thoroughly enjoy it.\\
384 - Just tell her to leave.\\
385 - I can't do that.\\
386 - She's Chelsea's best friend.\\
387 - They were college roommates.\\
388 - Really?\\
389 - You think they experimented?\\
390 - Oh, yeah.\\
391 - (both chuckle)\\
392 - I gotta figure out a way to get Gail to leave on her own.\\
393 - You got the perfect tool for the job.\\
394 - What are you talking about?\\
395 - The one tool that's guaranteed\\
396 - to drive any woman out of your house.\\
397 - Hello.\\
398 - Oh, look, it's an Allen wrench.\\
399 - What was that about?\\
400 - Nothing. Nothing.\\
401 - I was just telling Berta that maybe I was wrong\\
402 - about you not having a shot with Gail.\\
403 - Why? Did she say something?\\
404 - Did she ask about me?\\
405 - How would you feel about a double wedding?\\
406 - I mean, as long as you're paying for one.\\
407 - Slow down, slow down.\\
408 - Nobody said anything.\\
409 - I just realized I might've been jealous\\
410 - 'cause she's so beautiful and if I can't have her,\\
411 - I didn't want you to have her either.\\
412 - Yeah, I was thinking it might be that.\\
413 - Anyway, it's not fair for me\\
414 - to stand in the way of your happiness.\\
415 - Really?\\
416 - I always thought that was one of your favorite things.\\
417 - Do you want to pick nits\\
418 - or do you want to go talk to a beautiful woman\\
419 - who's extremely vulnerable\\
420 - and may very well be looking for revenge sex?\\
421 - I don't want revenge sex,\\
422 - I want a loving relationship that has depth and meaning\\
423 - and that will withstand the test of time.\\
424 - Oh, that's good.\\
425 - I'd lead with that.\\
426 - You think?\\
427 - Oh, yeah, go get her.\\
428 - All right.\\
429 - All right. Wish me luck.\\
430 - You don't need luck.\\
431 - You've got the exact skills needed to get this job done.\\
432 - Thanks, Charlie.\\
433 - You're a good brother.\\
434 - If he actually gets laid, I'm going to hang myself.\\
435 - (knocking on door) Come in.\\
436 - Hey, there.\\
437 - Hi, Alan.\\
438 - You, uh, up for a little company?\\
439 - I guess.\\
440 - You know, it does get easier.\\
441 - The wound does heal.\\
442 - I know. Thank you.\\
443 - I mean, it may not feel like it now,\\
444 - but before too long, you'll forget all about that fella\\
445 - who hurt you, because another fella will be in your heart.\\
446 - A fella who'll never hurt you.\\
447 - Who'll never leave your side.\\
448 - A fella who wants nothing more\\
449 - than to love you...\\
450 - GAIL: Oh, dear God, no.\\
451 - Thanks for your hospitality, Charlie,\\
452 - but I should get back home.\\
453 - Anytime. So where'd we leave it?\\
454 - Uh, I'll call you, you'll call me?\\
455 - I'll call you.\\
456 - So...\\
457 - how'd it go?\\
458 - You heard her.\\
459 - She's gonna call me.\\
460 - * Men. *\\
461 - You knew very well that Gail was going through a difficult time.\\
462 - So what do you do?\\
463 - You try to take advantage,\\
464 - to-to exploit her vulnerability...\\
465 - What is it about an angry woman that I find so hot?\\
466 - (no audio)\\
467 - Even when that fat cashier at the supermarket\\
468 - was yelling at me, I got a little engorged.\\
469 - (no audio)\\
470 - Boy, if I could just find somebody like Chelsea.\\
471 - I mean, look at her go.\\
472 - She's a real fireball.\\
473 - Speaking of fireballs,\\
474 - next time I manscape I should probably skip the aftershave.

1 - * Men.\\
2 - (sighs)\\
3 - (panting)\\
4 - Wow. That was great.\\
5 - Good, I'm glad.\\
6 - Wait, wait, wait. You're glad?\\
7 - Yeah.\\
8 - I knew it.\\
9 - There was no "gaa."\\
10 - "Gaa"?\\
11 - When the sex is working for you,\\
12 - you try to say "God," but it comes out "gaa."\\
13 - And this time, there was no "gaa."\\
14 - Charlie...\\
15 - No "gaa," no good.\\
16 - And I'll tell you another thing.\\
17 - You usually grab my ass like you're holding\\
18 - a tree trunk in a hurricane.\\
19 - Just now, it was more like you were palming\\
20 - a couple of cantaloupes at the supermarket.\\
21 - Fireworks don't have to go off every time\\
22 - for me to enjoy it.\\
23 - Oh, please, fireworks is the whole point of the exercise.\\
24 - Otherwise, all you've got is\\
25 - two naked people humping on a StairMaster.\\
26 - Sometimes it's nice just being close.\\
27 - Nice being close.\\
28 - Great.\\
29 - Now I know what it's like to be my brother.\\
30 - Would you stop it?\\
31 - No, this is the beginning of the end.\\
32 - First our sex life goes to hell,\\
33 - then we start eating dinner at 4:30,\\
34 - watching reruns of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,\\
35 - and at 9:00 we shake hands, pee and go to sleep.\\
36 - Then around midnight I get up to pee again.\\
37 - Quit making such a big deal out of it.\\
38 - Just because every once in a while\\
39 - I don't have an orgasm...\\
40 - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!\\
41 - This has happened before?\\
42 - Just a few times.\\
43 - Why didn't I know? Were you faking it?\\
44 - Does it matter?\\
45 - You're damn right, it matters.\\
46 - Why'd you stop? Don't you love me anymore?\\
47 - Of course I love you.\\
48 - If you really loved me, you'd keep faking it.\\
49 - Fine, from now on I'll fake it.\\
50 - Too late. Now I'm on to you.\\
51 - Honey, there's nothing to get so upset about.\\
52 - I've just been working really hard, under a lot of stress.\\
53 - Then on top of that, I'm trying to plan our wedding\\
54 - and dealing with my parents, your mother.\\
55 - But trust me, as far as I'm concerned,\\
56 - you're still the sexiest man on Earth\\
57 - and I'm the luckiest woman who ever lived.\\
58 - (snoring)\\
59 - Lucky, lucky, lucky.\\
60 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
61 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
62 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
63 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
64 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men... *\\
65 - * Men.\\
66 - I thought you were taking\\
67 - your girlfriend out for dinner.\\
68 - I am. But if I eat first,\\
69 - I won't pig out in the restaurant and make her sick.\\
70 - Good idea. That way you'll have\\
71 - the whole rest of the night to make her sick.\\
72 - Exactly.\\
73 - Plus I won't snap at her if she reaches for one of my fries.\\
74 - All right, Chelsea'll be home in a few minutes.\\
75 - How are we doing?\\
76 - The wine's decanting, pasta's on the stove,\\
77 - salad's in the fridge, Marvin Gaye's on the CD player.\\
78 - (chuckles) Gay.\\
79 - And what about this?\\
80 - Where's this gonna be tonight?\\
81 - It has a date.\\
82 - Oh, eating first.\\
83 - I taught you well.\\
84 - Thank you.\\
85 - Clean underwear?\\
86 - Cleanish.\\
87 - Not good enough.\\
88 - With underwear, there's no gray area.\\
89 - Don't worry, it's not gray.\\
90 - Anything but white is unacceptable.\\
91 - In that case, I'd better change.\\
92 - And take off the bib!\\
93 - If he can score just once before I die,\\
94 - my life will have been worthwhile.\\
95 - Well, then you might want to start eating healthier.\\
96 - What's the big occasion tonight?\\
97 - There's no big occasion.\\
98 - Just trying to keep the fire going with Chelsea.\\
99 - You know what's good for that?\\
100 - Doing it in public.\\
101 - Really?\\
102 - Yeah, there's nothing like the thrill\\
103 - of thinking you might get caught.\\
104 - I gotta tell ya,\\
105 - you almost walked in on me a couple of times.\\
106 - You're kidding.\\
107 - Just a heads-up, the next time you see\\
108 - the Sparkletts' truck parked outside, avoid the garage.\\
109 - (sighs)\\
110 - From now on, I'm gonna avoid water.\\
111 - * Men.\\
112 - Good news, Alan, you're going to the movies tonight.\\
113 - Alan?\\
114 - * Blame it on the bossa nova\\
115 - * With its magic spell\\
116 - * Blame it on the bossa nova\\
117 - * That he did so well.\\
118 - What are you doing?\\
119 - Nothing.\\
120 - What is that?\\
121 - That's, uh, that's hairspray.\\
122 - Really? Hairspray. Let me see it.\\
123 - No. Leave me alone.\\
124 - What's the big deal?\\
125 - It's not a big deal. Just go away.\\
126 - All right, but I need you out of the house tonight\\
127 - so I can be alone with Chelsea.\\
128 - Don't worry, I have a date.\\
129 - Another Internet hook up?\\
130 - SuaveSingles.com.\\
131 - First month's free.\\
132 - That must be how they keep out the riffraff.\\
133 - Have fun.\\
134 - Thank you, I will.\\
135 - Hey! Hey!\\
136 - "Captain Terry's Spray-On Hair.\\
137 - Guaranteed to cover bald spots."\\
138 - It's not really a bald spot.\\
139 - I'm just getting a little thin on top.\\
140 - So you're painting your head?\\
141 - It's not paint.\\
142 - It's a specially formulated hairlike substance\\
143 - designed for the active man on the go.\\
144 - Oh, you poor, gullible bastard.\\
145 - It gives me confidence.\\
146 - Okay, fine.\\
147 - But what happens to your confidence\\
148 - when your date runs her fingers through your...\\
149 - specially formulated hairlike substance?\\
150 - It's "guaranteed not to smear, drip or ignite\\
151 - under normal circumstances."\\
152 - So you're gonna spend the rest of your life spray-painting\\
153 - your head like it's a freeway underpass?\\
154 - This is just a stopgap till the pills kick in.\\
155 - What's this, like Propecia?\\
156 - Better, stronger.\\
157 - It's from Eastern Europe where they don't have\\
158 - to worry about all those pesky FDA regulations.\\
159 - There's a monkey on the label.\\
160 - It is not a monkey, it's the inventor.\\
161 - How long have you been taking these?\\
162 - A couple of weeks.\\
163 - It has to build up in your system,\\
164 - and then stand back and grab a comb.\\
165 - Okay, well, far be it for me to judge someone\\
166 - for taking questionable pharmaceuticals,\\
167 - but be careful with this stuff.\\
168 - Charlie, do you really think I'm so vain\\
169 - that I would jeopardize my health\\
170 - just to grow a little hair?\\
171 - Do I have to remind you\\
172 - about the Japanese penis enlargement system you bought?\\
173 - That is not what caused the rupture.\\
174 - I'm sorry, but this is a monkey.\\
175 - * Men.\\
176 - (both breathing heavily)\\
177 - So did you make your way around the mountain?\\
178 - Excuse me?\\
179 - You know, were you driving six white horses?\\
180 - What are you talking about?\\
181 - * She'll be driving six white horses when she... *\\
182 - Are you asking me if I had an orgasm, Charlie?\\
183 - Yeah, but I'm trying to be cute about it.\\
184 - No, I did not.\\
185 - But it doesn't matter.\\
186 - It was wonderful.\\
187 - Were you at least close?\\
188 - Yes, I was close.\\
189 - Well, that's a start.\\
190 - Now, when you were close, what was I doing?\\
191 - You were downstairs getting a beer.\\
192 - I'm kidding.\\
193 - Can we please just drop it?\\
194 - Excuse me for trying to bring you back to "gaa."\\
195 - Sex is not just about orgasms.\\
196 - Oh, really?\\
197 - Then how are we supposed to know when we're done?\\
198 - Don't pout.\\
199 - I'm not pouting.\\
200 - Yes, you are. Your bottom lip is sticking out.\\
201 - It's swollen.\\
202 - You could've stopped at any time.\\
203 - No, no, I am not a quitter.\\
204 - Sweetheart, do you know what the best part of tonight was?\\
205 - For you or me?\\
206 - 'Cause I think mine was pretty obvious.\\
207 - It was that you cared enough\\
208 - to plan this amazing evening for me.\\
209 - The beautiful dinner, wine on the deck,\\
210 - the two of us talking, just being together.\\
211 - It's nights like these that make me realize how lucky I am\\
212 - to have found the man I want to spend the rest of my life with.\\
213 - (snoring)\\
214 - Lucky, lucky, lucky.\\
215 - * Men.\\
216 - Oh! Oh! Oh!\\
217 - Hey. Hey.\\
218 - Alan, I don't know how to tell you this,\\
219 - but your bangs are dripping down your face.\\
220 - A little lesson for you, Charlie.\\
221 - There are two things you never want to buy on the cheap:\\
222 - canned hair and condoms.\\
223 - I'm assuming it never got to condoms?\\
224 - No, it did not.\\
225 - Once my hair started dripping on her chicken marsala,\\
226 - the evening was pretty well shot.\\
227 - I probably should've sprung for Captain Terry's Hair Sealer.\\
228 - Well, maybe you'll have better luck with the monkey pills.\\
229 - Oh, thanks for reminding me.\\
230 - If the date was so bad, why are you home so late?\\
231 - I've been at the emergency room having my eyes flushed.\\
232 - Apparently, my hair contains small particles of fiberglass.\\
233 - What the hell's he doing?\\
234 - Trying to sneak in two hours after curfew.\\
235 - Aren't you gonna punish him?\\
236 - Maybe tomorrow.\\
237 - It's hard to assume any kind of moral authority\\
238 - with Captain Terry's specially formulated hair\\
239 - all over my face.\\
240 - True. You do kinda look like a hot fudge sundae.\\
241 - * Men.\\
242 - * Men.\\
243 - Oh, hey.\\
244 - Didn't see you there.\\
245 - That's the first time anyone ever said that to me.\\
246 - Taking a lunch break?\\
247 - Sure, let's call it that.\\
248 - Mind if I ask you a question?\\
249 - It's Liz Taylor's White Diamonds.\\
250 - What?\\
251 - My fragrance.\\
252 - You can get it at Costco.\\
253 - Nice.\\
254 - It's a great stocking stuffer for Christmas.\\
255 - I'll remember.\\
256 - I'll act surprised.\\
257 - Actually, I was gonna ask you about when you were married.\\
258 - Which time?\\
259 - What was the long one?\\
260 - Jerry. 14 years.\\
261 - God rest his soul.\\
262 - He's dead? He better be.\\
263 - Okay, well, when Jerry walked among us,\\
264 - was there a time when he wasn't, you know,\\
265 - doing it for you?\\
266 - You mean even though he was doing it to me?\\
267 - Yeah.\\
268 - Well, sure. But that's natural.\\
269 - Passion always fades over time.\\
270 - Before you know it, you find yourself daydreaming,\\
271 - barely noticing the naked guy with the bad mullet\\
272 - and the flip-flops doing his dirty business on top of you.\\
273 - Jerry?\\
274 - God, no-- I never let Jerry on top.\\
275 - He was like a fur-covered water heater.\\
276 - So that's it?\\
277 - That's all I have to look forward to?\\
278 - A wife that has to go to a happy place\\
279 - every time I have sex with her?\\
280 - Is Chelsea complaining?\\
281 - No.\\
282 - Can you read her mind?\\
283 - No.\\
284 - Then don't worry about it.\\
285 - How can I not worry?\\
286 - Orgasms is one of the few things\\
287 - I bring to the table in this relationship.\\
288 - Well, I can't argue with you there.\\
289 - But maybe this is the perfect opportunity\\
290 - for you to become a better boyfriend,\\
291 - a more compassionate, caring individual.\\
292 - Or you could buy her one of them vibrating eggs.\\
293 - They're awesome.\\
294 - I heard.\\
295 - I got to go.\\
296 - Man, I hope I can hold on to this buzz\\
297 - until the Sparkletts' guy gets here.\\
298 - * Men.\\
299 - (knocking)\\
300 - Alan, you in here?\\
301 - Bathroom.\\
302 - Getting ready for a date.\\
303 - Another Suave Single?\\
304 - No, my free trial expired.\\
305 - Now I'm on J-Date.\\
306 - Alan, we're not Jewish.\\
307 - Who cares? You should see these girls--\\
308 - very hotsy-totsy.\\
309 - And the best part is, till my hair pills kick in,\\
310 - two birds with one stone.\\
311 - So, how can I help you?\\
312 - (sighs): Well... believe it or not,\\
313 - I wanted to ask your advice about women.\\
314 - Me? I'm flattered.\\
315 - What do you want to know?\\
316 - Well...\\
317 - Sit, boychick.\\
318 - Okay, I'm having a little problem,\\
319 - you know, satisfying Chelsea in the bedroom.\\
320 - Uh-huh.\\
321 - So I thought to myself, who knows more\\
322 - about not satisfying a woman than my brother Alan?\\
323 - That's a very unfair characterization...\\
324 - but not entirely inaccurate.\\
325 - Go on.\\
326 - My question is...\\
327 - how do you live with yourself?\\
328 - How do you wake up in the morning\\
329 - and not drag a straight razor across your throat?\\
330 - Well, that's not an easy question to answer.\\
331 - Uh, first of all, I don't own a straight razor.\\
332 - This is what happened with you and Judith, right?\\
333 - Actually, Judith was always highly orgasmic.\\
334 - Really?\\
335 - Not with me, of course.\\
336 - But as long as I didn't let the battery drawer get empty,\\
337 - she was one happy shiksa.\\
338 - So, how did you deal with that?\\
339 - Didn't it make you feel like less of a man?\\
340 - Okay, I understand.\\
341 - Your problem is, your male ego\\
342 - is tied to your partner's sexual pleasure.\\
343 - Your self-esteem is almost entirely based\\
344 - on whether or not she achieves some level\\
345 - of physical satisfaction. Uh-huh.\\
346 - You got to get past that.\\
347 - What, you're saying I shouldn't care?\\
348 - Charlie... our people have spent thousands of years\\
349 - carrying the burden of guilt.\\
350 - I say enough!\\
351 - It's time to break the shackles.\\
352 - Okay, okay, first of all, I'm pretty sure\\
353 - that our people are Scotch-Irish.\\
354 - Perhaps. But the Talmud teaches us\\
355 - that the true worth of a man is in his good works\\
356 - and devotion to God.\\
357 - The Talmud? Yeah, I Googled it.\\
358 - Figured I might need a little Jewish dinner chat.\\
359 - Lucky I did some research--\\
360 - I was planning on taking this girl to Red Lobster.\\
361 - Meshuggah,right?\\
362 - Oh! Uh, I got to go.\\
363 - Oh, uh, listen, Jake's grounded for coming in late last night,\\
364 - so be a mensch and keep an eye on the little pisher, would you?\\
365 - Oy...\\
366 - vay.\\
367 - * Men.\\
368 - This is fun, huh?\\
369 - I guess.\\
370 - Gin.\\
371 - Damn.\\
372 - Okay.\\
373 - Let's go again.\\
374 - You do realize that at a certain point\\
375 - we're going to have to go to bed.\\
376 - I know. I know. It's not like\\
377 - I'm avoiding it or anything.\\
378 - Really? Because this is the first time\\
379 - since I've known you you've suggested we play a game\\
380 - that doesn't involve money or nudity.\\
381 - We could play for money if you want.\\
382 - What do you say, penny a point?\\
383 - We'll go to bed when someone's up a hundred bucks.\\
384 - Come on, are we gonna talk\\
385 - about the elephant in the room or not?\\
386 - What's there to talk about?\\
387 - I can't ring your bell anymore,\\
388 - so we'll grow old, I'll die,\\
389 - and you'll find happiness with a vibrating egg.\\
390 - Did you ever stop to consider that maybe this isn't about you?\\
391 - No, not really.\\
392 - Well, it isn't.\\
393 - Then what's it about?\\
394 - It's personal.\\
395 - What's more personal than bumping pee-pees?\\
396 - All right, fine.\\
397 - My ex-husband's getting remarried.\\
398 - I'm sorry, are we still having the same conversation?\\
399 - I know it sounds stupid, but ever since I found out,\\
400 - I somehow felt shut down.\\
401 - Why?\\
402 - I don't know, I guess because\\
403 - he's moving on with his life.\\
404 - Yeah, but you're getting married, too.\\
405 - Yeah, but I'm getting married because I'm over him.\\
406 - He's getting married because he's over me.\\
407 - Wait a minute, wait a minute.\\
408 - Are you still in love with him?\\
409 - Of course not, you idiot-- I'm in love with you.\\
410 - Well, good, good, because I'm sure feeling loved.\\
411 - I'm sorry.\\
412 - Okay, let me just make sure I'm following this.\\
413 - Knowing that this guy is getting married\\
414 - has somehow gotten in the way of you having an orgasm.\\
415 - Maybe.\\
416 - I think so.\\
417 - Boy, women.\\
418 - What's that supposed to mean?\\
419 - Well, nothing, nothing.\\
420 - It's just I once had an orgasm with a lawn dart in my foot.\\
421 - Do you think I'm crazy?\\
422 - No, no. No.\\
423 - Having sex right over the hedge\\
424 - from where the kids were throwing the lawn darts--\\
425 - that was crazy.\\
426 - And believe it or not, I do understand.\\
427 - You do? Well, sure.\\
428 - No one wants their former lovers to be happy.\\
429 - They don't? Well, hell, no.\\
430 - Most of my former lovers want me dead.\\
431 - A couple have tried.\\
432 - In fact, now that I know you have a vengeful, petty side,\\
433 - I love you even more.\\
434 - Thanks... I guess.\\
435 - Don't worry about the sex.\\
436 - It'll work itself out,\\
437 - just like the lawn dart.\\
438 - I love you, Charlie. Well, you should.\\
439 - I'm being really sensitive and understanding and all that crap.\\
440 - Now, how about another game?\\
441 - All right.\\
442 - (sighs)\\
443 - I got to tell you.\\
444 - I'm kind of relieved to find out I'm not the problem.\\
445 - Neither of us is the problem.\\
446 - It's just that I have feelings.\\
447 - Okay, for me, that would be a problem.\\
448 - You do realize that Jake just snuck out of the house.\\
449 - Well, he's grounded.\\
450 - How else is he gonna leave?\\
451 - Hey, how about the winner of the next hand gets\\
452 - to be sexually satisfied without any guilt or reciprocity?\\
453 - You have a good hand, don't you?\\
454 - No, not at all.\\
455 - All right, it's a bet.\\
456 - Gin.\\
457 - * Men.\\
458 - CHELSEA: Gaa!\\
459 - (sighs)\\
460 - Okay, I got to ask.\\
461 - Was that a real "gaa," or a mercy "gaa"?\\
462 - Oh, that was the real thing.\\
463 - So, it was good?\\
464 - Lawn dart good.\\
465 - You know what I think?\\
466 - I think the fact that you shared your feelings with me,\\
467 - and I really listened, made the sex more intimate\\
468 - and helped you overcome whatever was inhibiting you from...\\
469 - (Chelsea snoring)\\
470 - Well, that's just rude.\\
471 - * Men.\\
472 - * Men.\\
473 - Morning.\\
474 - Morning.\\
475 - Hey, looks like your hair is really filling in back there.\\
476 - Yeah, I think the pills are starting to work.\\
477 - What?

23 - Yeah, that'll do it.\\
24 - It's just a couple of dance lessons\\
25 - so we don't look like idiots at our wedding.\\
26 - Hey, I have said yes to everything\\
27 - having to do with this stupid wedding,\\
28 - but this is too much.\\
29 - You think our wedding is stupid?\\
30 - If I have to dance, it is.\\
31 - You know what, just drop dead.\\
32 - Fine.\\
33 - I'll drop dead, and you can dance on my grave.\\
34 - SPORTSCASTER (over TV): ...three games last year,\\
35 - but I guarantee you Carson Palmer\\
36 - didn't miss guys wide open.\\
37 - That hurts.\\
38 - SECOND SPORTSCASTER: And certainly not\\
39 - in their comeback against California\\
40 - down at the L.A. Coliseum.\\
41 - Leinart overthrows...\\
42 - You do know you're going\\
43 - to be taking dancing lessons?\\
44 - Oh, yeah.\\
45 - Does that depress you?\\
46 - A little.\\
47 - May I suggest you try Lumitrol.\\
48 - What?\\
49 - Unless you're already taking an MAO inhibitor,\\
50 - in which case, consult your physician.\\
51 - Hard to believe he's flunking tenth grade.\\
52 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
53 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
54 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
55 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
56 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
57 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
58 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
59 - * Men.\\
60 - Hey. Hey.\\
61 - Did you cave on the dancing?\\
62 - Yeah.\\
63 - You have to grovel?\\
64 - Like a leper at a kissing booth.\\
65 - Did you at least get makeup sex?\\
66 - Nope.\\
67 - Wow, it's like you're already married.\\
68 - Yeah, I might as well just give her my testicles right now\\
69 - and use the empty sack as a man purse.\\
70 - Hey, hey, don't knock the man purse.\\
71 - Terrific way to carry your keys,\\
72 - ChapStick, sunblock, moist wipes.\\
73 - Please move out of my house.\\
74 - Hey, face it, big brother.\\
75 - We're a team.\\
76 - Like Ernest and Julio Gallo.\\
77 - Seriously, get some cardboard boxes,\\
78 - fill them with your crap and go.\\
79 - Now, see, that's just misdirected anger.\\
80 - You're not mad at me; you're mad at yourself\\
81 - for trading your dignity and self-respect\\
82 - for security, peace of mind and regular sex.\\
83 - Where do you get that?\\
84 - I've been married twice, Julio.\\
85 - (clears throat)\\
86 - The key is to make the best of it.\\
87 - Uh, like with the dance lessons, for instance.\\
88 - They... they can be fun.\\
89 - You and Chelsea practicing,\\
90 - learning to glide across the dance floor\\
91 - as a single organism,\\
92 - embracing the music like the breath of life itself.\\
93 - Okay, first, decorate my house, then move out.\\
94 - Cute. You'll see what I'm talking about\\
95 - on your wedding day when you step out\\
96 - onto the dance floor with your new bride\\
97 - and sweep her into your arms with everybody watching.\\
98 - I'm sorry. I can't see it.\\
99 - Let me help you.\\
100 - * Precious and few are the moments *\\
101 - * We two can share...\\
102 - How'd you know that's the song she wants for our first dance?\\
103 - Who do you think suggested it to her?\\
104 - Okay.\\
105 - Let's see what you got.\\
106 - What? Dance with me. Come on.\\
107 - Are you out of your mind?\\
108 - I'm just going to give you a few tips.\\
109 - Keep your tip away from me.\\
110 - You can either embarrass yourself now\\
111 - or you can embarrass yourself at your first dance class\\
112 - in front of Chelsea and a bunch of strangers.\\
113 - Okay, I just want you to know\\
114 - I'm only letting you touch me\\
115 - 'cause I'm half in the bag.\\
116 - Boy, if I had a nickel for every time I heard that.\\
117 - Now, put your right hand on my lower back.\\
118 - And your left hand holds my right hand.\\
119 - Okay.\\
120 - Whoa, whoa!\\
121 - We're not cracking walnuts.\\
122 - Firmly but gently, like you hold a baby bird.\\
123 - I've never held a baby bird.\\
124 - Okay, like you hold a boob.\\
125 - I am holding a boob.\\
126 - Ha ha.\\
127 - Now, we're going to start with a simple waltz.\\
128 - You're the boy, and I'm the girl.\\
129 - That's how it would break down in prison.\\
130 - I don't know, Charlie.\\
131 - You've always been the pretty one.\\
132 - And...\\
133 - one, two, three, two, two, three.\\
134 - One, two, three,\\
135 - two, two, three.\\
136 - Okay, you're going to have to back off a half step.\\
137 - There's no groin contact in ballroom dancing.\\
138 - Huh.\\
139 - Wonder if that's why they call it "ball room".\\
140 - Man, your grandmother really did a number\\
141 - on those poor bastards.\\
142 - It's a miracle I turned out as well as I did.\\
143 - * Men.\\
144 - (playing "Precious and Few")\\
145 - (segues into Chopin's "Marche Fun  bre")\\
146 - Hey, Uncle Charlie, want to dance with me?\\
147 - Hey, Jake, want to live in a foster home?\\
148 - Sometimes.\\
149 - Don't sass me, boy.\\
150 - I'll take the switch to you.\\
151 - Hello, man of my dreams.\\
152 - Hello, love of my life.\\
153 - Hello, reason I go to therapy.\\
154 - You go to therapy because you're weak.\\
155 - I'm weak because you broke my spirit at age five.\\
156 - Oh, boo-hoo for you.\\
157 - Guys, guys, can we please not do this?\\
158 - What?\\
159 - Just saying hello.\\
160 - I'm going to go put this stuff away.\\
161 - Thanks again for the scarf.\\
162 - My pleasure, dear.\\
163 - Looks beautiful on you.\\
164 - Thank you.\\
165 - That woman is just a treasure.\\
166 - I know.\\
167 - Worth her weight in gold. Yes, she is.\\
168 - Speaking of which, have you talked to her about a prenup?\\
169 - What?\\
170 - No, I'm not going to ask her for a prenup.\\
171 - Charles, 50% of all marriages end in divorce.\\
172 - And guess which half the guys\\
173 - who can't keep it in their pants fall into?\\
174 - Hey, I have never once cheated on Chelsea.\\
175 - How long have you known her?\\
176 - I don't know-- about a year and a half.\\
177 - How long do you plan on being married?\\
178 - Criminy, I need a prenup.\\
179 - * Men.\\
180 - And...\\
181 - one, two, three, one, two, three.\\
182 - Very... nice, two, three.\\
183 - You're doing great, sweetie.\\
184 - Have you been practicing?\\
185 - No, no, no.\\
186 - I'm a musician.\\
187 - It's instinctive.\\
188 - So, the pictures Jake e-mailed me\\
189 - of you and Alan cheek to cheek was just what,\\
190 - a tender moment between brothers?\\
191 - How old do kids have to be\\
192 - before it's legal to punch them?\\
193 - Come on.\\
194 - You'd never hit Jake.\\
195 - That's exactly what I want you to tell Child Services.\\
196 - I think it's great that you cared\\
197 - enough about this to practice.\\
198 - So, I get some points in the bank?\\
199 - Whole bunch.\\
200 - Good. Good.\\
201 - Hey, speaking of banks,\\
202 - I've been thinking.\\
203 - Now, don't overreact,\\
204 - but maybe we should start talking about,\\
205 - you know, the possibility of getting some kind of a--\\
206 - what do you call them?-- prenup.\\
207 - Sure.\\
208 - You want your lawyer to draw it up or mine?\\
209 - INSTRUCTOR: Now switch partners with the couple to your left.\\
210 - Hello.\\
211 - Hi.\\
212 - Are you two getting married?\\
213 - Yeah.\\
214 - That's wonderful.\\
215 - It took me 38 years\\
216 - to get my husband to dance with me.\\
217 - Well, better late than never.\\
218 - He's only doing it now 'cause I caught him\\
219 - banging our church organist.\\
220 - Wow.\\
221 - Want to help a nice lady give a little payback?\\
222 - Switch!\\
223 - Hi. Missed you.\\
224 - Me, too.\\
225 - So, you were saying you're okay with the prenup thing?\\
226 - Yeah. In fact, I was trying\\
227 - to figure out a way to bring it up.\\
228 - Really? Why were you going to bring it up?\\
229 - Well, I just think it's smart\\
230 - for both of us to protect our property.\\
231 - (chuckles)\\
232 - What property do you have?\\
233 - Um, not a lot.\\
234 - Just a little real estate.\\
235 - Real estate?\\
236 - No big deal.\\
237 - Just a few apartment buildings.\\
238 - Buildings?\\
239 - INSTRUCTOR: And switch!\\
240 - Keep walking, pal.\\
241 - When were you planning on telling me you own buildings?\\
242 - Um, I didn't think it was that important.\\
243 - Well, it's important enough for you to want a prenup.\\
244 - Hey, you're the one who brought it up.\\
245 - Yeah, but I'm not hiding anything from you.\\
246 - You know everything I've got.\\
247 - A house on the beach, a car in the garage\\
248 - and a worthless douche in my guest room.\\
249 - What about all the royalties from your music?\\
250 - Yeah well, uh...\\
251 - you've got buildings.\\
252 - Just three.\\
253 - Just three?\\
254 - Why are you getting so upset?\\
255 - I thought I knew you.\\
256 - I had no idea you had some secret life as a slumlord.\\
257 - I'm not a slumlord.\\
258 - Two of the buildings are in the marina,\\
259 - and one's in Brentwood.\\
260 - Oh, my God, that's even worse.\\
261 - Why?\\
262 - We've been together almost two years.\\
263 - Would it have killed you\\
264 - to pick up a check once in a while?\\
265 - Switch!\\
266 - Hello again.\\
267 - * Men. *\\
268 - * Men. *\\
269 - EMCEE: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome\\
270 - for the first time as husband and wife,\\
271 - Mr. and Mrs. Alan Harper.\\
272 - * Now I've had the time of my life *\\
273 - * No, I've never felt like this before *\\
274 - * Yes, I swear it's the truth\\
275 - * And I owe it all to you\\
276 - (high-pitched): * 'Cause I've had the time of my life *\\
277 - * And I owe it all to you...\\
278 - (door closes)\\
279 - Hey.\\
280 - How was dance lessons?\\
281 - Want to know how dance lessons were?\\
282 - I'll tell you how dance lessons were.\\
283 - Chelsea wants a freakin' prenup!\\
284 - Just 'cause you dance like a middle-aged white guy?\\
285 - I'm not middle-aged.\\
286 - Oh, sorry.\\
287 - You. You're middle-aged.\\
288 - I'm younger than you.\\
289 - You're also broke,\\
290 - losing your hair and sleeping on my hide-a-bed.\\
291 - Always gotta bring a gun to a knife fight, don't you?\\
292 - What the hell are you watching?\\
293 - It's my wedding video.\\
294 - No kidding. Where am I?\\
295 - In the coat room banging Judith's sister.\\
296 - Oh, right.\\
297 - Wish you had that video.\\
298 - So why does Chelsea want a prenup?\\
299 - Apparently she's got three fancy apartment buildings\\
300 - she doesn't want me to get my hands on.\\
301 - Really? Anything I could live in for free?\\
302 - You know, house-sit,\\
303 - building manager in lieu of rent.\\
304 - How did this become about you?\\
305 - Fine, I'll stay here.\\
306 - Oh, good. I was worried.\\
307 - The point is, Chelsea's been keeping a secret from me.\\
308 - Well, maybe she just wants to make sure that you loved her\\
309 - for herself and not her property.\\
310 - Oh, so I don't even get the choice?\\
311 - I would think that you would be happy.\\
312 - This means she's financially well-off\\
313 - and doesn't care about your money.\\
314 - Which makes me trust her even less.\\
315 - What?\\
316 - Alan, think it through.\\
317 - If she's not interested in my money,\\
318 - then why is she marrying me?\\
319 - I have no idea.\\
320 - Exactly.\\
321 - We may have to consider the possibility\\
322 - that Chelsea's insane.\\
323 - I see your point.\\
324 - She look like she's sorry?\\
325 - Yeah.\\
326 - Sorry she ever met you.\\
327 - Hey, Chels.\\
328 - Hello, Alan.\\
329 - Brr.\\
330 - My nipples just got hard.\\
331 - Yeah, well, too bad.\\
332 - She deceived me and she doesn't trust\\
333 - that our marriage is going to last.\\
334 - Aren't you the one who wanted the prenup in the first place?\\
335 - That's different. How is that different?\\
336 - Because when I brought it up,\\
337 - I thought I had more stuff than her.\\
338 - Okay, let me get this straight.\\
339 - You're upset because you're marrying a woman\\
340 - whose only character flaw\\
341 - is that she happens to have her own money?\\
342 - I knew you wouldn't understand.\\
343 - (remote clicks)\\
344 - * So we take each other's hand\\
345 - * 'Cause we seem to understand\\
346 - * The urgency\\
347 - * Just remember\\
348 - FEMALE VOCALIST: * You're the one thing\\
349 - MALE VOCALIST: * I can't get enough of...\\
350 - That's the last time she ever moved her pelvis like that.\\
351 - * Men. *\\
352 - So, are we going to talk,\\
353 - or you're going to sit there pretending to read?\\
354 - I'm not pretending.\\
355 - If I didn't know how to read,\\
356 - I would've told you a long time ago.\\
357 - I wouldn't have deceived you.\\
358 - Don't be such a child.\\
359 - I'm the child?\\
360 - You're the one who's been keeping secrets.\\
361 - Wasn't really a secret.\\
362 - I would've told you if you'd asked.\\
363 - Oh, really?\\
364 - So it's my fault that I didn't ask you\\
365 - if you're a land baron?\\
366 - What else should I be asking you?\\
367 - Were you born with a penis?\\
368 - Is this your home planet?\\
369 - Okay, now you're being ridiculous.\\
370 - No, no, no, what I'm being is committed to this relationship.\\
371 - Really? You're committed?\\
372 - Yes, and I've jumped through hoops to prove it to you.\\
373 - What hoops? Dancing lessons?\\
374 - No, not dancing lessons.\\
375 - Yeah, okay, dancing lessons.\\
376 - And meeting your mom, and being nice to your friends,\\
377 - even all the ones that don't like me,\\
378 - and letting you put these stupid throw pillows on my bed.\\
379 - Did I ever complain about that? Constantly.\\
380 - And yet here they are.\\
381 - With your frilly curtains\\
382 - and your girly lamps.\\
383 - It's like living inside the I Dream of Jeanie bottle.\\
384 - So I'm supposed to be grateful\\
385 - because you've behaved the way a fianc   is supposed to behave\\
386 - towards the woman he loves?\\
387 - Oh, yeah.\\
388 - Okay, I see.\\
389 - Now you're going to turn it around on me.\\
390 - Make me the bad guy.\\
391 - Where are you going?\\
392 - I'm sleeping on the couch.\\
393 - In my house.\\
394 - Which you know I own\\
395 - because I bragged about it the first night we met.\\
396 - (door slams)\\
397 - Alan.\\
398 - What? What-what's wrong?\\
399 - Chelsea and I had a fight.\\
400 - Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.\\
401 - You want to talk about it?\\
402 - I just did. Now go sleep on the couch.\\
403 - Wait, if you and Chelsea had the fight\\
404 - why do I have to sleep on the couch?\\
405 - You ever hear of crap rolling uphill?\\
406 - Now get out.\\
407 - You know, just using the word "please"\\
408 - would go such a long way with me.\\
409 - Fair enough.\\
410 - Please get out\\
411 - before I pull your pajama bottoms up so far\\
412 - you'll be wearing your balls as a bolo tie!\\
413 - There, was that so hard?\\
414 - * Men. *\\
415 - I'm sorry for keeping a secret from you.\\
416 - Is there any way I can make it up to you?\\
417 - Okay, I would be remiss...\\
418 - (Chelsea screams)\\
419 - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!\\
420 - You let me lay down naked on top of you!\\
421 - I didn't know it was you! I thought it was a dream\\
422 - and then when I realized it was you, I didn't know what to say\\
423 - and you're so soft and warm and... (groans)\\
424 - Oh!\\
425 - Oh, I deserve that.\\
426 - What the hell's going on in here?\\
427 - Your brother's a pervert!\\
428 - You woke me up to tell me that?\\
429 - I came down here to apologize for keeping a secret.\\
430 - It was dark, and I thought it was you under the covers,\\
431 - so I laid down naked on him and he let me!\\
432 - You let Chelsea lie naked--\\
433 - Wait a minute. You came down to apologize?\\
434 - Yes.\\
435 - So, you're saying I'm right and you're wrong?\\
436 - Yes. You're right.\\
437 - Excuse me, I didn't quite get that.\\
438 - Do you want to gloat or do you want to come upstairs\\
439 - and let me make it up to you?\\
440 - Ooh, make up. I choose make up.\\
441 - Come on.\\
442 - Right behind you.\\
443 - You sick freak. (high-pitched scream)\\
444 - Still worth it.\\
445 - * Men. *\\
446 - (laughs)\\
447 - At least I hope it did for the sake of the honeymoon.\\
448 - Unless, of course, you're into that kind of thing.\\
449 - (laughs)\\
450 - To Alan and Judith.\\
451 - (cheering, applause)\\
452 - Mmm!\\
453 - And now...\\
454 - I'd like to introduce the best man,\\
455 - although I consider him to be a bitter disappointment,\\
456 - Alan's brother Charlie.\\
457 - (applause)\\
458 - Charlie?\\
459 - Charlie?\\
460 - Charles!\\
461 - Coming!\\
462 - What's going on?\\
463 - You're making a toast to your brother and his bride.\\
464 - Oh. How am I doing?\\
465 - Just make the toast.\\
466 - Okay.\\
467 - Can I throw in a word about the bride's sister?\\
468 - No.\\
469 - Got it.\\
470 - Well, just FYI, that word would've been "nasty."\\
471 - Don't look at me like that, Judy.\\
472 - Your sister's a freak.\\
473 - * She's a super freak\\
474 - * Super freak\\
475 - * She's super freaky\\
476 - * Super freak, super freak\\
477 - * She's super freaky... Unbelievable.

10 - Speaking of generosity,\\
11 - check out what I got Chelsea.\\
12 - Diamond earrings. Nice.\\
13 - Yeah. She dropped a couple of hints\\
14 - about stuff she wanted.\\
15 - But I wasn't really listening, so I got her these.\\
16 - How romantic. Will she be joining us for dinner?\\
17 - I think so.\\
18 - She's out doing some last minute shopping.\\
19 - Or something with work, again, I wasn't really listening.\\
20 - Why did you mail me a letter?\\
21 - Oh, I decided to send out a Harper Christmas Newsletter.\\
22 - You know, keep everybody updated on all things Harper.\\
23 - You're kidding.\\

37 - Keep going, keep going.\\
38 - "He tried his darnedest in every class.\\
39 - And made tenth grade by the skin of his ass."\\
40 - And, see, I put in a little drawing\\

88 - She's spending Christmas with her mom in Brentwood.\\
89 - So what, your life just stops when she's gone?\\
90 - That's the deal we made.\\
91 - Listen to me, if you want to go talk to the beach girl,\\
92 - you've got every right to do so.\\
93 - Are you sure?\\
94 - I don't think so.\\
95 - Don't worry about it.\\
96 - Just go talk to her.\\
97 - Can I borrow ten bucks?\\
98 - Why?\\
99 - If she shoots me down,\\
100 - then I can go buy a couple corn dogs.\\
101 - She's not going to shoot you down.\\
102 - Yeah, but now I got a taste for corn dogs.\\
103 - Just go.\\
104 - What if she wants a corn dog? She's about to meet one.\\
105 - Now get out of here.\\
106 - Do I look okay?\\
107 - Jake, she waved at you. She smiled.\\
108 - Clearly her standards aren't that high.\\
109 - Right. Thanks.\\
110 - When did I turn 42?\\
111 - Son of a bitch.\\
112 - Hey, I'm an organ donor. Good for me.\\
113 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
114 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
115 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
116 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
117 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men... *\\
118 - * Men.\\
119 - Hey, Berta, merry Christmas.\\
120 - Thank you, Charlie.\\
121 - You're very generous.\\
122 - Well, I just want you to know\\
123 - that I appreciate all your hard work.\\
124 - And I appreciate you pretending I work hard.\\
125 - Hey, you feeling lucky?\\
126 - What do you got in mind?\\
127 - My Christmas bonus--\\
128 - double or nothing that Zrbnck makes the field goal.\\
129 - Are you crazy?\\
130 - That's 52 yards.\\
131 - He hasn't made one that long all year.\\
132 - I got a hunch.\\
133 - You got a bet.\\
134 - ANNOUNCER: There's the snap.\\
135 - The kick is up.\\
136 - It's long enough, but wide.\\
137 - It's no good.\\
138 - Zrbnck's missed another one.\\
139 - Well, happy birthday, Jesus.\\
140 - Told ya.\\
141 - No biggie.\\
142 - Easy come, easy go.\\
143 - Sorry.\\
144 - Looks like the grandkids are getting\\
145 - beef jerky and Lotto scratchers this year.\\
146 - Here.\\
147 - You're too kind.\\
148 - Don't mention it.\\
149 - You got a big heart.\\
150 - Thank you.\\
151 - Double or nothing they don't make the first down.\\
152 - Hey.\\
153 - Oh, hey. Where you been?\\
154 - Out on the beach.\\
155 - So, how'd it go?\\
156 - Fine. I'm getting her a grape soda.\\
157 - No, no, no, no, no.\\
158 - You don't bring the grape soda to her.\\
159 - You bring her to the grape soda.\\
160 - Her who?\\
161 - Hang on.\\
162 - You bring her here.\\
163 - She sees your beautiful house.\\
164 - She thinks you've got it going on,\\
165 - and then you've got a shot at...\\
166 - Well, I don't know what you got a shot at, but you got a shot.\\
167 - Whoa, whoa, catch me up.\\
168 - Do you see what I'm saying?\\
169 - So I should bring her here?\\
170 - Absolutely.\\
171 - Women love this house.\\
172 - It's an aphrodisiac.\\
173 - I don't think she's afro anything.\\
174 - She's more like Chinese.\\
175 - Wait, who's Chinese? What's going on?\\
176 - He met a girl on the beach and I'm helping him out.\\
177 - What about Celeste?\\
178 - Uncle Charlie said my life shouldn't stop just 'cause she's not around.\\
179 - So you're encouraging my son to cheat on his girlfriend?\\
180 - Oh, come on, there's no cheating going on.\\
181 - Are you cheating? I'm not sure.\\
182 - You're not cheating.\\
183 - Yes, he is.\\
184 - How would you feel if Celeste was somewhere right now\\
185 - flirting with some other guy?\\
186 - How do you know she's not?\\
187 - She's with her mom.\\
188 - And you're with your dad,\\
189 - but that's not stopping you, is it?\\
190 - Good point.\\
191 - No, no, it's a lousy point.\\
192 - Relationships are built on trust and mutual respect.\\
193 - Oh, grow up.\\
194 - Relationships are built on diamond earrings and Viagra.\\
195 - Now go take the young lady her grape soda.\\
196 - I still think it would help\\
197 - if I had some corn dog money to flash around.\\
198 - Go.\\
199 - Shame on you.\\
200 - What's the big deal?\\
201 - It's not like he and this Celeste girl are sleeping together.\\
202 - No, no, but I think that once a relationship reaches any physical level,\\
203 - there's an implied commitment.\\
204 - Yeah, that's because you married the first girl\\
205 - who touched your wiener.\\
206 - Not true.\\
207 - The first girl who touched my wiener was Maxine Chernakoff.\\
208 - And she refused to marry me.\\
209 - As did the blind girl at camp, the school nurse\\
210 - and crazy cousin Wendy.\\
211 - * Men.\\
212 - I hope you're proud of yourself.\\
213 - I'm more proud of him.\\
214 - I mean, he actually got her back here\\
215 - without hitting her over the head\\
216 - and stuffing her in a burlap sack.\\
217 - Pretty girl.\\
218 - Yep.\\
219 - You'd think she'd have more self-esteem.\\
220 - Hey, Jake may be dull-witted, but he does have\\
221 - a certain je ne sais quoi with the ladies.\\
222 - Well, maybe six years of picking his underwear up with a rake\\
223 - has made me immune to his charms.\\
224 - Hey.\\
225 - Hey. Nice work talking her into coming back here.\\
226 - I didn't really talk her into it.\\
227 - She had to pee.\\
228 - Yeah, but you gave her the grape soda that made it happen.\\
229 - Now, Jake, you're just hanging out\\
230 - with this girl, right-- as friends?\\
231 - So far. What does that mean?\\
232 - It means I haven't made my move yet.\\
233 - What move?\\
234 - I'm not sure.\\
235 - That's why I haven't made it yet.\\
236 - Anyways, I don't think it's going to get serious.\\
237 - She doesn't even live here.\\
238 - She doesn't?\\
239 - No, she's just in town for the holidays visiting her aunt.\\
240 - She pronounced it "awnt," but I figured it out.\\
241 - Oh, dude, you have hit the jackpot here. I have?\\
242 - This girl is most likely looking for a hot story\\
243 - to tell her friends back home,\\
244 - and you, you cute, little, clueless bastard,\\
245 - can be the star of that story.\\
246 - Really?\\
247 - Yes, so stop wasting time.\\
248 - What are you even doing in here?\\
249 - I had to fart, and I didn't want to do it in front of her.\\
250 - Attaboy. Good thinking.\\
251 - I thought it was you. I thought it was you.\\
252 - (doorbell ringing)\\
253 - Oh, that must be Mom.\\
254 - Mom? What's Mom doing here?\\
255 - Well, it's Christmas Eve, Charlie.\\
256 - I know. Why isn't she out stealing toys in Whoville?\\
257 - Merry Christmas, one and all.\\
258 - Hello. Hi, Mom.\\
259 - Boys, this is the legendary TV producer\\
260 - Mr. Marty Pepper.\\
261 - Hi. Hello.\\
262 - (loudly): Marty, these are my sons,\\
263 - Charlie and Alan.\\
264 - Is it important which is which?\\
265 - Not really.\\
266 - Would you help me with the wheelchair?\\
267 - I'll call you Scooter.\\
268 - And you, uh, Dutch.\\
269 - Uh, Mom...\\
270 - are, uh, are you and he, um...?\\
271 - Oh, good Lord, no.\\
272 - The man is 1,000 years old.\\
273 - It's a wonder his scrotum doesn't get tangled up in the wheels.\\
274 - So he's just a friend?\\
275 - Yes.\\
276 - And I just couldn't let him spend Christmas Eve alone--\\
277 - rattling around his 25,000 square foot\\
278 - Beverly Hills mansion, with adjoining guest house,\\
279 - Olympic size saltwater pool and home theater.\\
280 - There it is.\\
281 - Are you really this hard up for a listing?\\
282 - Alan, it's a $60-million home.\\
283 - My commission will be almost $2 million.\\
284 - How much did you make last year?\\
285 - Welcome to our home, Mr. Pepper!\\
286 - What are you shouting for?\\
287 - I'm incontinent, not deaf.\\
288 - Sorry.\\
289 - What?\\
290 - Have an Abba Zaba, Marty.\\
291 - Thank you.\\
292 - Did I ever tell you I knew Lucille Ball?\\
293 - Yes, you did, dear.\\
294 - You know, she wasn't a real redhead.\\
295 - Ask me how I know.\\
296 - Warning: it's dirty.\\
297 - (clicks tongue)\\
298 - Uncle Charlie, I think Celeste knows I'm seeing another woman.\\
299 - What? Why?\\
300 - She's texting me.\\
301 - What are you talking about?\\
302 - Nothing, nothing.\\
303 - Jake has a shot at some out-of-town strange.\\
304 - You see how he is corrupting your grandson?\\
305 - Come on, Alan.\\
306 - It's out-of-town strange.\\
307 - Do you really have a shot?\\
308 - I don't know.\\
309 - Uncle Charlie seems to think so.\\
310 - Tell her you wanna get her her own sitcom.\\
311 - Never fails.\\
312 - (text alert plays)\\
313 - There she is again. What do I do?\\
314 - Just text her back, "Thinking of you."\\
315 - Which you are, so you're not lying.\\
316 - Good, that's good.\\
317 - Okay, this may be your house, but this is my son.\\
318 - Yeah, and you've been living here seven years,\\
319 - which makes us a common-law couple, which makes him our son.\\
320 - Homos with a kid.\\
321 - A great idea for a sitcom.\\
322 - (text alert plays)\\
323 - It worked. She wrote back,\\
324 - "Merry Christmas, I miz you."\\
325 - Then write back, "I miz you, too."\\
326 - Man, you are good.\\
327 - Look at that.\\
328 - Our little boy is growing up.\\
329 - How would you feel about us having another child?\\
330 - * Men.\\
331 - (piano playing "Jingle Bell Rock")\\
332 - * Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock *\\
333 - * Jingle bells swing and jingle bell ring *\\
334 - * Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun *\\
335 - * Now the jingle hop has begun *\\

344 - * Giddy-up, jingle horse, pick up your feet *\\
345 - * Jingle around the clock...\\
346 - Alan?\\
347 - * Mix and mingle with the jinglin' feet *\\
348 - Alan?\\
349 - * That's the jingle bell, that's the jingle bell... *\\
350 - Alan?!\\
351 - 40 years ago you asked for a little brother for Christmas.\\
352 - Happy?\\
353 - * That's the jingle bell rock! *\\
354 - Could somebody move me?\\
355 - My chestnuts are roasting by this open fire.\\
356 - Is that you?\\
357 - I thought Alan burned the ham.\\
358 - Berta, don't you wanna spend Christmas with your family?\\
359 - Do you wanna spend Christmas with yours?\\
360 - Let me freshen your drink.\\
361 - What is that fragrance you're wearing, my dear?\\
362 - Ben Gay and foot powder.\\
363 - Whatever it is, it's making me hot.\\
364 - Turkey's almost done.\\
365 - Aren't you gonna put on some nice clothes?\\
366 - Why? It's just gonna be you, me,\\
367 - Chelsea, Berta, Mom\\
368 - and the ghost of showbiz past.\\
369 - And Jake.\\
370 - No, Jake split.\\
371 - What?\\
372 - He's hangin' with his new girlfriend.\\
373 - Where?\\
374 - Her aunt's house.\\
375 - I think they got the place to themselves,\\
376 - so he might get a little, you know,\\
377 - peace on Earth tonight.\\
378 - How do you make everything sound dirty?\\
379 - Hey, I took the high road.\\
380 - I coulda gone with "Come, all ye faithful."\\
381 - (sighs)\\
382 - He needs to be home.\\
383 - Oh, come on, Alan.\\
384 - He's got a real shot with that girl.\\
385 - I don't care. It's Christmas Eve. So?\\
386 - So if I can't get laid, nobody gets laid.\\
387 - Yeah, Jake, this is your father.\\
388 - Whatever you're doing,\\
389 - I want you to stop it and get your ass home.\\
390 - What's he doing? Is he decking her hall?\\
391 - Shut up!\\
392 - Right now, mister!\\
393 - Fine, bring her back here if you want.\\
394 - Yes, there's still pie left.\\
395 - (doorbell rings)\\
396 - What are you lookin' at?\\
397 - How would you like to have your own sitcom?\\
398 - Hi. Is Jake home?\\
399 - Um, I don't know.\\
400 - Sorry to intrude, but Celeste wanted\\
401 - to give Jake his Christmas present.\\
402 - Please come in.\\
403 - Aw, crap.\\
404 - Wow, check out the mom.\\
405 - Forget the mom.\\
406 - We gotta get rid of 'em\\
407 - before Jake walks in here with another girl.\\
408 - Yeah, yeah, good idea.\\
409 - Uh, hi, hi. I'm, uh, Alan, Jake's divorced father.\\
410 - Keisha, Celeste's mother.\\
411 - Her mother?\\

1 - * Men.\\
2 - So what time is your flight?\\
3 - 8:00 a.m.\\
4 - 8:00 a.m.?\\
5 - Wow.\\
6 - Yep.\\
7 - You want me to drive you? That'd be nice.\\
8 - So what time you think we should leave, around 6:00?\\
9 - To be on the safe side.\\
10 - Sure, sure.\\
11 - You never know with traffic and airport security and all.\\
12 - Would you rather I call a cab?\\
13 - No, no. No, I won't hear of it.\\
14 - I'll call one for you.\\
15 - Golly, I'm gonna miss you.\\
16 - A couple days without sex won't kill you.\\
17 - It's not just sex.\\
18 - You're my friend, my companion.\\
19 - And what makes you think I'm not going to have sex?\\
20 - Excuse me?\\
21 - Hey, when the cat's away, the mice masturbate.\\
22 - Tell you what,\\
23 - why don't you open a bottle of wine,\\
24 - come upstairs and I'll give the mice something to remember me by.\\
25 - Oh, yay, fresh memories.\\
26 - Much better than the video of you on my iPhone.\\
27 - You took video of me on your iPhone?\\
28 - Well, I...\\
29 - Just a little.\\
30 - I'd have asked permission, but you were kind of busy.\\
31 - Give me the phone.\\
32 - Aw...\\
33 - Give it.\\
34 - Thank you.\\
35 - Oh, Charlie!\\
36 - What? You can't even tell it's you.\\
37 - I can't turn my back on you, can I?\\
38 - Actually, I have photographic evidence that you can.\\
39 - Not anymore.\\
40 - Aw...\\
41 - Don't pout.\\
42 - Just get the wine and come upstairs.\\
43 - Okay.\\
44 - And leave the phone down here.\\
45 - Aw...\\
46 - Let's see, what's the proper wine for the occasion?\\
47 - Ah, who cares? Everything goes with ass biting.\\
48 - Hey.\\
49 - Thought you were on a date.\\
50 - I was.\\
51 - It didn't go well.\\
52 - Really? You're usually such a hit with the ladies.\\
53 - This might have been the worst date of my life.\\
54 - Did she dress you in a leather bustier\\
55 - and tie you to a bed?\\
56 - No.\\
57 - Did she Super Glue a model car to your balls?\\
58 - No.\\
59 - Did she talk you into putting on one of Mom's dresses\\
60 - while she stole your wallet?\\
61 - No.\\
62 - Well, then this wasn't even your worst date this month.\\
63 - I suppose.\\
64 - And thanks for the highlight reel, by the way.\\
65 - Happy to help.\\
66 - I feel like going down to the beach\\
67 - and diving into the ocean and swimming out\\
68 - until my arms are so tired that I sink below the waves\\
69 - into blessed oblivion.\\
70 - Hold on. Before you do anything crazy,\\
71 - can you help me get this bottle open?\\
72 - Sure. I mean...\\
73 - these women you meet online--\\
74 - you think you have some kind of a connection,\\
75 - you know, a bond,\\
76 - and then you meet them face-to-face\\
77 - and there's nothing.\\
78 - Just two lonely strangers staring at each other\\
79 - across buffalo wings and soft-serve ice cream.\\
80 - Well, maybe your problem is taking them to a mall food court on a first date.\\
81 - Well, excuse me, but I don't want to make a big investment\\
82 - until I have a sense of where things are going.\\
83 - Plus, the parking is free.\\
84 - Here you go.\\
85 - Thank you.\\
86 - Okay, well, good catching up.\\
87 - If you're going for that swim,\\
88 - make sure you tuck your driver's license\\
89 - in your crack so I can identify your body.\\
90 - I mean, is it so much to ask to make a connection with another human being?\\
91 - No, it's not.\\
92 - I'm not even looking for sex. I just want a little companionship.\\
93 - That's rough. Buy a dog.\\
94 - You said I couldn't have a dog in the house.\\
95 - Fine. Buy a dog and move.\\
96 - You know what would be great?\\
97 - If you could find a dog with its own house.\\
98 - What's taking you so long?\\
99 - Oh, hi, Alan.\\
100 - How was your date? Awful.\\
101 - Oh, I'm sorry. You want to talk about it?\\
102 - No. He's going for a swim.\\
103 - Well, I-I could use a friendly ear.\\
104 - Of course. Now tell me, this is the girl you met online?\\
105 - Uh-huh. "Perky Dodger fan in Tarzana."\\
106 - So what happened? First of all, she wasn't so much perky as porky.\\
107 - More like a Dodger Dog fan.\\
108 - Don't you hate it when people misrepresent themselves?\\
109 - I do. When someone makes a date with\\
110 - "Buff Malibu doctor," that's just what they get.\\
111 - (indistinct conversation)\\
112 - Apparently, even when the cat's here,\\
113 - the mice have to masturbate.\\
114 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
115 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
116 - * Men.\\
117 - (TV playing)\\
118 - Hey.\\
119 - Hey.\\
120 - (whistle blowing)\\
121 - Watching some football?\\
122 - No fooling you.\\
123 - Who are we rooting for?\\
124 - The spread.\\
125 - Ah, so we're making an illegal wager.\\
126 - Technically.\\
127 - Don't get me wrong, I'm not judging.\\
128 - It's really a victimless crime, don't you think?\\
129 - So far.\\
130 - Sorry.\\
131 - Heard any good jokes lately?\\
132 - Yeah.\\
133 - Two brothers are sitting on a couch.\\
134 - One of them says, "Heard any good jokes lately?"\\
135 - And then the other one--\\
136 - get this-- the other one lights him on fire.\\
137 - Okay, we'll just watch the game.\\
138 - Thank you.\\
139 - All right, it's a commercial.\\
140 - Now you can talk.\\
141 - Well, I was thinking, with Chelsea out of town...\\
142 - Hold on, hold on, it's that baby that trades stocks.\\
143 - I love this kid.\\
144 - (chuckles)\\
145 - Look at this...\\
146 - Okay, go ahead.\\
147 - I was thinking, with Chelsea out of town,\\
148 - that maybe, you know, after the game...\\
149 - you and I could go out and grab a bite to eat.\\
150 - No, thanks.\\
151 - Not hungry?\\
152 - Don't like you.\\
153 - Oh, come on, I need some human contact.\\
154 - (doorbell ringing)\\
155 - That's probably a human.\\
156 - Go contact them.\\
157 - That was clever.\\
158 - I'm a clever guy.\\
159 - Well, hey, buddy. You're here early.\\
160 - Oh, I was thinking, that if you're hungry,\\
161 - you and I could grab a bite to eat and... (door closing)\\
162 - Maybe later.\\
163 - He's been a little crabby since his girlfriend dumped him.\\
164 - The kid's a stone-cold bummer, Alan.\\
165 - Okay, well, thanks for dropping him off.\\
166 - You're welcome. Oh, hey, Herb,\\
167 - by any chance, do you want to go out and maybe grab a bite?\\
168 - Really? You and me?\\
169 - Sure. Why not?\\
170 - That's kind of weird, isn't it?\\
171 - I mean, you're the ex-husband, I'm the current.\\
172 - So we've got something in common.\\
173 - We do, don't we?\\
174 - Right.\\
175 - Neither one of us is having sex with Judith.\\
176 - (laughing)\\
177 - That's actually a little too close to home.\\
178 - Sorry.\\
179 - So what do you think?\\
180 - I could eat.\\
181 - Let's go.\\
182 - Uh, you ever been to Kabob Kingdom?\\
183 - At the food court? I love that place.\\
184 - (sportscast playing)\\
185 - Hey, Berta, would you grab me a beer?\\
186 - Sure.\\
187 - Jake, grab your uncle a beer.\\
188 - Let him get it himself.\\
189 - Sorry. I tried.\\
190 - Hey, numbnuts, just take a beer out of the fridge\\
191 - and bring it over here.\\
192 - Fine.\\
193 - Here.\\
194 - Thank you.\\
195 - What's with the attitude?\\
196 - You're the reason Celeste broke up with me.\\
197 - You still grinding on that?\\
198 - Yeah, I'm still grinding on it. I love her.\\
199 - Stop it. You love fart jokes and pie.\\
200 - Fart jokes, pie and Celeste.\\
201 - If you hadn't talked me into hanging out\\
202 - with that other girl, I'd still have all three.\\
203 - Oh, come on, pal.\\
204 - At your age, relationships aren't serious.\\
205 - They're just, you know, puppy love.\\
206 - No, no, this wasn't puppy love.\\
207 - This was... dog love.\\
208 - Trust me, you have not had dog love yet.\\
209 - I don't even think your father's had dog love yet.\\
210 - Not unless you count getting bitch slapped.\\
211 - I promise you'll get over this.\\
212 - You'll meet somebody else.\\
213 - You'll love her, she won't love you.\\
214 - She'll love you, you won't love her.\\
215 - You'll love each other, but she's married to a cop\\
216 - who catches you in a motel room and beats you near to death\\
217 - with his big police flashlight.\\
218 - The point is,\\
219 - you've got a lot of living to do, right, Berta?\\
220 - You don't want to piss off a cop.\\
221 - Thanks, Uncle Charlie.\\
222 - You've really given me a lot to think about.\\
223 - Hey, hey, hey, nobody likes a smartass.\\
224 - Not so sexy when it happens to you, is it?\\
225 - * Men.\\
226 - I give up, Herb.\\
227 - How do you tell a kabob to be quiet?\\
228 - Shh... kabob.\\
229 - Very clever. Very clever.\\
230 - Well, when you're a pediatrician,\\
231 - you need to have a lot of kid-friendly jokes.\\
232 - Sometimes when I use the little reflex hammer,\\
233 - I pretend I'm an Indian.\\
234 - (chanting)\\
235 - It's not politically correct, but the tykes love it.\\
236 - Oh, boy.\\
237 - I wish my doctor had a sense of humor.\\
238 - Every time I have a prostate exam, I say,\\
239 - "What, you're not going to buy me dinner first?"\\
240 - And nothin',\\
241 - not even a smile.\\
242 - Really? 'Cause that's a beaut.\\
243 - That's what I thought.\\
244 - But most people just don't get me.\\
245 - Well, that's their loss.\\
246 - (ringtone playing "I've Been Working on the Railroad")\\
247 - Excuse me.\\
248 - Uh-oh.\\
249 - Hi, Judith.\\
250 - I, uh, just stopped for a bite to eat.\\
251 - I know you have leftover meat loaf.\\
252 - Probably left over from when I was married to her.\\
253 - Shh, shh, shh.\\
254 - What?\\
255 - That was Alan.\\
256 - Yes, that Alan.\\
257 - Hi, Judith.\\
258 - No, no, Jake's not here. It's just the two of us.\\
259 - No, I have not lost my mind.\\
260 - Whoa, whoa.\\
261 - Calm down.\\
262 - Judith, calm down.\\
263 - Can we talk about this when I get home?\\
264 - All right, bye.\\
265 - She says hi back.\\
266 - Sorry to get you in trouble.\\
267 - Oh, no trouble. I'm a grown man.\\
268 - And I think I can have lunch with whoever I want.\\
269 - Right.\\
270 - So, how's the chiropractor biz?\\
271 - Well, it's been a little slow,\\
272 - you know, with the economy and everything,\\
273 - but I'm starting to see a little turnaround, and it's been...\\
274 - I'm sorry. I gotta go.\\
275 - * Men.\\
276 - (acoustic guitar playing soft chords)\\
277 - JAKE: * Oh, Celeste, you are the best *\\
278 - * With you I was blessed, but I failed the test *\\
279 - * And now I'm depressed, Celeste... *\\
280 - * You might as well take my heart *\\
281 - * Out of my chest\\
282 - * And mail it...\\
283 - * All the way to Budapest\\
284 - (knocking)\\
285 - Got a minute?\\
286 - I'm busy.\\
287 - Yeah, I heard.\\
288 - Budapest.\\
289 - Very catchy.\\
290 - What do you want?\\
291 - I want to apologize for sending you down a bad road\\
292 - with your girlfriend.\\
293 - Yeah, well, forget it. I'm gonna get her back.\\
294 - Well, good, good.\\
295 - So what's the plan?\\
296 - I'm gonna finish writing my song\\
297 - and then I'm gonna sing it to her.\\
298 - Okay, uh, is that the entire plan?\\
299 - No.\\
300 - I'm also gonna put on a clean shirt.\\
301 - Ooh, pulling out the big guns.\\
302 - Yep.\\
303 - Can I offer an alternative plan?\\
304 - I don't want to hear any more plans from you.\\
305 - Understandable.\\
306 - I'd be a little skeptical in your shoes,\\
307 - but just hear me out.\\
308 - The song, good as it is, it smacks of desperation.\\
309 - Thank you.\\
310 - Uh, no, no.\\
311 - I mean, girls don't generally respond to desperation.\\
312 - How do you know?\\
313 - Are you kidding? I've been watching your father\\
314 - get shot down for 25 years.\\
315 - It's like living with an Air Force training film.\\
316 - Listen, if you really want to get Celeste back, you man up,\\
317 - go over to her house,\\
318 - admit you made a mistake with the other girl,\\
319 - you realize now that Celeste is one in a million,\\
320 - blah, blah, blah, and if she doesn't\\
321 - ever wanna see you again, you understand.\\
322 - And then sing her the song?\\
323 - Forget the song.\\
324 - Okay.\\
325 - Do I really say "blah, blah, blah"?\\
326 - * Men.\\
327 - Alan, wait!\\
328 - You forgot your kabob.\\
329 - Oh. Oh, thank you.\\
330 - You're welcome.\\
331 - And thanks again for driving.\\
332 - It was fun.\\
333 - Oh, yeah, I had a good time, too.\\
334 - I'm glad.\\
335 - So... we should do it again sometime.\\
336 - I'd like that.\\
337 - Great, great. You know, I'm gonna go\\
338 - to the flea market tomorrow. You wanna join me?\\
339 - Tomorrow?\\
340 - Oh, gee, I don't know.\\
341 - Oh, I'm sorry. It's probably too soon.\\
342 - No, no.\\
343 - No, it's not, it's just...\\
344 - Judith. I know, I know.\\
345 - I'm just not sure what to tell her.\\
346 - Well, you can tell her the truth.\\
347 - What is the truth, Alan?\\
348 - That we're friends.\\
349 - We are friends, aren't we?\\
350 - Okay, friend.\\
351 - I'll see ya tomorrow.\\
352 - It's a date.\\
353 - (chuckles)\\
354 - (chuckles)\\
355 - (chuckles)Oh! Jake, Jake, hi, buddy. Um...\\
356 - I don't care. I got my own problems.\\
357 - * Men.\\
358 - * Oh, Celeste, I am congested\\
359 - * With love for my Celeste... ed *\\
360 - * Yeah\\
361 - (knocking)\\
362 - Did you talk to her?\\
363 - Yeah.\\
364 - How'd it go?\\
365 - Not so good.\\
366 - You sang that song, didn't you?\\
367 - No, I did exactly what you said.\\
368 - I told her I'm sorry,\\
369 - I made a mistake with that other girl\\
370 - and she's one in a million, blah, blah, blah.\\
371 - Okay, just to be clear,\\
372 - you didn't really say "blah, blah, blah"?\\
373 - I'm not an idiot, Uncle Charlie.\\
374 - No, no, of course not. Then what?\\
375 - Then I said if she never wants to see me again, I'd understand.\\
376 - And what'd she say?\\
377 - "I never want to see you again."\\
378 - Ouch.\\
379 - Ouch? That's it?\\
380 - That's all you've got?\\
381 - Well, you know, look at the bright side.\\
382 - You got a great song out of it.\\
383 - Ten more girls peein' on you, you got an album.\\
384 - Or a fetish.\\
385 - Okay, well...\\
386 - say no to drugs.\\
387 - * Men.\\
388 - (doorbell chimes)\\
389 - Oh, hey, Judith.\\
390 - Just came by to pick up Herb.\\
391 - We're going to the flea market.\\
392 - No, you're not.\\
393 - What do you mean? I just talked to him.\\
394 - Look, Alan, I discussed it with Herb and we decided\\
395 - that it's not in anyone's best interest for you two\\
396 - to be spending time together.\\
397 - You both decided that, huh? Yes.\\
398 - Well, if you don't mind, I'd like to hear it from Herb.\\
399 - I do mind.\\
400 - The two of you hanging out is wrong. It's unnatural.\\
401 - Excuse me, but I have done a few unnatural things\\
402 - in my day, and this is not unnatural.\\
403 - Good-bye, Alan.\\
404 - Our marriage, that was unnatural!\\
405 - You can't do this, Judith!\\
406 - You cannot keep us apart!\\
407 - Herb and I will find a way to be together!\\
408 - Hi.\\
409 - Hi.\\
410 - That must've sounded kinda strange.\\
411 - Not at all.\\
412 - Herb is a very handsome man.\\
413 - * Men.\\
414 - Hey, I brought you another soda.\\
415 - Thanks.\\
416 - (sighs)\\
417 - Believe me, Jake, you'll get over Celeste.\\
418 - I don't wanna get over her. I think she was the one.\\
419 - The one what?\\
420 - The one, you know, who was pretty and liked me\\
421 - and maybe was gonna let me do stuff to her someday.\\
422 - And you think there's only one of those out there?\\
423 - What do you think?\\
424 - It doesn't matter what I think.\\
425 - Jake, you gotta start looking at this differently.\\
426 - Women are kinda like the little boxes of cereal\\
427 - in one of those variety packs.\\
428 - I like the variety packs.\\
429 - I know you do.\\
430 - But they should put in more sugary cereals\\
431 - and less cereals that help you poop.\\
432 - No argument.\\
433 - But my point is, a variety pack approach gives you a choice.\\
434 - It's really not that great a choice.\\
435 - In a pack of eight,\\
436 - there's always at least three poopin' cereals.\\
437 - Okay, we're getting away from the point.\\
438 - What's your favorite cereal?\\
439 - It used to be Frankenberry,\\
440 - but I'm kind of on a Froot Loops kick now. Terrific.\\
441 - They don't get soggy as fast. Got it.\\
442 - Plus the milk tastes better afterward.\\
443 - Okay, okay, okay.\\
444 - So imagine Celeste is Froot Loops.\\
445 - You like her now,\\
446 - but who's to say she isn't tomorrow's Frankenberry?\\
447 - You're wrong.\\
448 - Celeste will always be my Froot Loops.\\
449 - You can't know that.\\
450 - Look at me.\\
451 - I've been with a lot of women,\\
452 - but I only just recently found the love of my life.\\
453 - Well, no disrespect, but I don't wanna wait\\
454 - until I'm as old and hard up\\
455 - as you are to find a good girlfriend.\\
456 - What? I said no disrespect.\\
457 - You know, you make it really difficult to love you sometimes.\\
458 - Yeah, that's what my mom says.\\
459 - Told ya I'm not an idiot.\\
460 - * Men.\\
461 - (hushed): Herb!\\
462 - Herb!\\
463 - (thud)\\
464 - Alan?\\
465 - Over here!\\
466 - Alan...\\
467 - I didn't want you to think that I stood you up.\\
468 - Oh, I know you'd never do that.\\
469 - Judith just doesn't understand.\\
470 - I know, and I'm sorry.\\
471 - But what are we gonna do?\\
472 - I don't know.\\
473 - Well, maybe I'll see you when I bring Jake back.\\
474 - That'd be nice.\\
475 - Bye.\\
476 - Bye.\\
477 - Alan, wait!\\
478 - I'm coming with you!\\
479 - But how?\\
480 - Be careful, you big galoot.\\
481 - I'm okay. I'm okay!\\
482 - (creaking)\\
483 - I'm not okay!\\
484 - (thud)\\
485 - Oh, God! Herb, talk to me!\\
486 - (groans)\\
487 - What's going on out here?!\\
488 - Alan, wait! Take me with you!\\
489 - * Men.\\
490 - (TV plays) I miss Celeste.\\
491 - I miss Chelsea.\\
492 - I miss Herb.\\
493 - Uh, I mean, I mean, Sex and the City.\\
494 - I miss Sex and the City.\\
495 - Yeah, Alan, that's much less gay.\\
496 - I guess that's just what our lives have come down to;\\
497 - three pathetic, lonely guys\\
498 - watching television on a Sunday night.\\
499 - Oh, crap, it's Sunday night!\\
500 - Chelsea's flying into LAX!\\
501 - You gonna pick her up?\\
502 - No, I'm gonna call her a cab and take a Viagra.\\
503 - Well, buddy, I guess it's you and me.\\
504 - No disrespect, Dad, but that just makes it worse.\\
505 - I said no disrespect.\\
506 - Why doesn't that ever work?\\
507 - (phone rings)\\
508 - Hello?\\
509 - Yeah, this is Jake.\\
510 - Oh, hi, Nicole.\\
511 - Yeah, I broke up with Celeste.\\
512 - Now?\\
513 - Sure. See ya in a few.\\
514 - I'm gonna go meet Nicole at the pier.\\
515 - Who's Nicole?\\
516 - I'm not really sure.\\
517 - (sighs)\\
518 - * I remember you...\\
519 - * You're the one who made my dreams come true. *\\
520 - (doorbell rings) (music stops)\\
521 - Herb.\\
522 - We haven't got much time.\\
523 - Judith thinks I'm in physical therapy.\\
524 - Well, then let's make the most of it.
\subsection {Episode 13: Yay, No Polyps!}
1 - * Men. *\\
2 - Hey, you got anything special going on next week?\\
3 - Well, let's see... next week.\\
4 - I like to keep Mondays free for hangovers.\\
5 - Tuesday, I was planning on getting a haircut,\\
6 - mani/pedi and a facial.\\
7 - You know, guy stuff.\\
8 - Wednesday, I have a meeting with my business manager\\
9 - to discuss my retirement plan.\\
10 - And, as you know, Thursday and Friday\\
11 - are kind of my "me" days.\\
12 - Why do you ask?\\
13 - I was thinking, since I have a couple days off,\\
14 - we could fly to Illinois and visit my parents.\\
15 - Oh.\\
16 - I mean, you've only met my mother once,\\
17 - and you've never met my dad.\\
18 - That's true.\\
19 - And I'd really like him\\
20 - to get to know you before the wedding.\\
21 - Of course.\\
22 - Although, sometimes with parents,\\
23 - I'm better served up as a surprise.\\
24 - Don't be silly-- he'll love you.\\
25 - And I'm sure I'll love him.\\
26 - So, good, we'll fly out.\\
27 - Illinois, here we come.\\
28 - I love you so much.\\
29 - I love you, too.\\
30 - Good night.\\
31 - Good night.\\
32 - Oh, darn it. What?\\
33 - I just remembered I have an appointment next week.\\
34 - Doctor's appointment?\\
35 - Yes.\\
36 - Yes, a doctor's appointment.\\
37 - Is everything okay? Oh, yeah.\\
38 - Yeah, just a routine procedure I've been putting off.\\
39 - What do you mean, like a colonoscopy?\\
40 - Yes, exactly.\\
41 - A colonoscopy.\\
42 - Oh, Charlie, you can't put that off.\\
43 - No, no. No.\\
44 - I want to meet your dad.\\
45 - I've been putting off getting a colonoscopy for years.\\
46 - Forget it, mister.\\
47 - You're keeping that appointment.\\
48 - But what about meeting your dad?\\
49 - We'll do it another time.\\
50 - Are you sure?\\
51 - Your health is the most important thing.\\
52 - I know how you procrastinate.\\
53 - I do, don't I?\\
54 - Boy, what would you do without me to take care of you?\\
55 - Well, I'm pretty sure\\
56 - I wouldn't be getting a colonoscopy next week.\\
57 - * Men. *\\
58 - (music playing on TV)\\
59 - Hey.\\
60 - Hey.\\
61 - You're not going to believe what I just did.\\
62 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
63 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
64 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
65 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
66 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
67 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
68 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
69 - * Men. *\\
70 - All right, let me see if I've got this straight.\\
71 - In order to not spend time with your fianc  e's parents,\\
72 - you're willing to let a doctor\\
73 - snake a camera up your keister.\\
74 - I'd be willing to let them shoot an IMAX feature.\\
75 - But, fortunately, it won't be necessary.\\
76 - Oh, how do you figure? I have a plan.\\
77 - Oh, a plan.\\
78 - The day of the "procedure,"\\
79 - you're going to pretend to drive me to the "hospital."\\
80 - But we're not going to the hospital.\\
81 - Precisely.\\
82 - What we'll actually do is go to the movies.\\
83 - Then, afterwards, we'll go out for a couple of drinks,\\
84 - so when I get home, I'll be appropriately woozy.\\
85 - And I'll tell Chelsea\\
86 - that my colon is clean as a whistle.\\
87 - You know, a whistle that you swallowed,\\
88 - then blew out your bunghole.\\
89 - Sure.\\
90 - And then, she'll put me to bed.\\
91 - I'll get some "Oh, poor Charlie" sex,\\
92 - with her being ever mindful of my tender area.\\
93 - Wow.\\
94 - This is a new low, even for you.\\
95 - Now, now, to be fair,\\
96 - it's only a new low in this relationship.\\
97 - True. True.\\
98 - Can I pick the movie?\\
99 - Fine.\\
100 - Do I get snacks?\\
101 - Yes.\\
102 - I'm paying for everything.\\
103 - Why do we continue to play this game?\\
104 - Because I still have my pride.\\
105 - No, you don't.\\
106 - Charlie, you okay?\\
107 - Uh, yeah, yeah.\\
108 - I was just reminding Alan\\
109 - that he has to take me in for my colonoscopy.\\
110 - Oh, that's not necessary. I'll take you.\\
111 - No, no, no, no, no.\\
112 - No, I don't want you wasting your time off\\
113 - in a doctor's waiting room.\\
114 - Don't be ridiculous. I'm driving you.\\
115 - Now, come back to bed.\\
116 - Good plan.\\
117 - * Men. *\\
118 - No, no, no, no, no.\\
119 - You don't understand.\\
120 - I need a colonoscopy, and it has to be next Wednesday.\\
121 - Yes, I'll hold.\\
122 - Can you believe it?\\
123 - Their hold music is "Tunnel of Love."\\
124 - It's better than "Brown Eyed Girl."\\
125 - Oh, God, I hope I can get an appointment.\\
126 - Maybe you should grease a few palms.\\
127 - If it was me, I'd be greasing everything.\\
128 - Yeah, hi.\\
129 - Well, great, great.\\
130 - Wednesday, 8:00 a.m.\\
131 - Thank you, thank you.\\
132 - You've made me very happy.\\
133 - Yeah, I imagine you don't hear that too often.\\
134 - What?\\
135 - Yeah, fine, fine.\\
136 - I-I-I won't eat on Tuesday.\\
137 - What do you mean, flush out my system?\\
138 - Oh, ick.\\
139 - All right, I'm a little less happy now.\\
140 - Good-bye.\\
141 - You won't believe what they want me to do.\\
142 - You mean taking laxatives and drinking a half gallon\\
143 - of industrial strength Colon Blow?\\
144 - Oh, right, you've done this before.\\
145 - It seemed funnier then.\\
146 - I got to tell you, it seems pretty funny now.\\
147 - Why don't you just tell Chelsea the truth?\\
148 - What, that I'd rather get violated by a long metal tube\\
149 - than spend time with her folks?\\
150 - Somehow, I don't see her taking that\\
151 - in the spirit in which it was intended.\\
152 - True, true.\\
153 - Well, I've said it before,\\
154 - and I think I need to say it again.\\
155 - Good plan.\\
156 - * Men. *\\
157 - Why isn't Uncle Charlie eating?\\
158 - He has to fast before he goes to the doctor's tomorrow.\\
159 - Is he okay?\\
160 - Oh, yeah.\\
161 - He's just getting a routine test.\\
162 - They're taking a look at his intestines.\\
163 - How do they do that?\\
164 - Well, what they do is, they take a tiny camera\\
165 - and put it on the end of a tube...\\
166 - Why don't we eat first?\\
167 - Good idea.\\
168 - (grunting, sighing)\\
169 - Well, I'm happy to report\\
170 - I just saw a piece of Hubba Bubba\\
171 - I swallowed in fifth grade.\\
172 - Oh, for God's sake, Charlie, we're having dinner.\\
173 - Don't rub it in.\\
174 - Speaking of which, I'm out of baby wipes.\\
175 - I bought you two boxes of baby wipes.\\
176 - What can I tell you?\\
177 - Babies don't crap like this.\\
178 - At least not healthy babies.\\
179 - There's a jar of aloe vera under the sink.\\
180 - What am I supposed to do with that?\\
181 - Oh, you put a little glob\\
182 - on the end of your finger... Alan!\\
183 - It's cooling and soothing.\\
184 - Oh, good, good.\\
185 - 'Cause let me tell you--\\
186 - you could roast a marshmallow on my anus.\\
187 - You know what'd be good for dessert?\\
188 - S'mores.\\
189 - * Men. *\\
190 - How come I'm not loaded?\\
191 - They're supposed to get me loaded\\
192 - before they do it, right?\\
193 - Yes. They'll hook you up to an IV\\
194 - right before the procedure.\\
195 - All right, just so we're all on the same page,\\
196 - I want to be stone-cold out before anything goes in.\\
197 - I'll tell them.\\
198 - All I get is a glass of wine and a "pretty please."\\
199 - All right, Mr. Harper, we're ready.\\
200 - Did you bring the drugs with you? Oh, no, sir.\\
201 - The anesthesiologist takes care of that.\\
202 - Good luck. Thanks.\\
203 - By the way, since we couldn't make it to Illinois,\\
204 - I'm flying my parents in to stay with us for a week.\\
205 - What?\\
206 - Enjoy your colonoscopy, you lying dirtbag.\\
207 - You knew?\\
208 - I knew.\\
209 - I'll give you $1,000 to push me to the parking lot.\\
210 - * Men. *\\
211 - * Men. *\\
212 - How are you feeling?\\
213 - Like a new fish at Leavenworth.\\
214 - Oh, don't be so dramatic.\\
215 - Good news is, you have a clean bill of health.\\
216 - Yes, but I lost my watertight seal.\\
217 - Yes, but you have peace of mind.\\
218 - Yes, but now I can't wear white at our wedding.\\
219 - (noisemakers blaring)\\
220 - Yay, no polyps!\\
221 - Way to go, Uncle Charlie.\\
222 - Now you know how it feels.\\
223 - Thanks for calling ahead.\\
224 - There's the happy couple.\\
225 - Welcome home.\\
226 - Charlie, you remember my mother, Martha.\\
227 - And this is my father, Tom.\\
228 - Good to see you again.\\
229 - You, too.\\
230 - Nice to finally meet you, Charlie. Nice to meet you.\\
231 - Uh, not much of a grip.\\
232 - But you're probably a little weak from your anal probe.\\
233 - Didn't make me stronger.\\
234 - Isn't this great, Charlie?\\
235 - Because you couldn't go see them, Chelsea's folks\\
236 - dropped everything to come spend time with you.\\
237 - Yeah. It's great.\\
238 - Isn't it funny how plans work out?\\
239 - Hey, I found some steaks in the freezer.\\
240 - Thought we'd have a little barbecue.\\
241 - Oh, Dad, he has to eat light for a while.\\
242 - Oh, please.\\
243 - He's been treated like a girl enough today.\\
244 - He's not wrong.\\
245 - I'm never wrong about what a man needs.\\
246 - (sniffs) Good golly.\\
247 - What's that fruity smell coming from your head?\\
248 - It's an apricot conditioner.\\
249 - It keeps my hair from getting frizzy\\
250 - with all the humidity.\\
251 - Oh, we need to get some meat in you, pronto.\\
252 - Tom's always on guard against the homosexual agenda.\\
253 - No offense.\\
254 - * Men. *\\
255 - You're a great cook, Tom.\\
256 - Well, I always say,\\
257 - a man's gotta be self-sufficient.\\
258 - I agree.\\
259 - All I need is booze, satellite TV and a housekeeper\\
260 - and I could survive in a cave.\\
261 - You know, if it were air-conditioned.\\
262 - I gotta ask you something, Charlie.\\
263 - Okay, I admit it.\\
264 - I slept with your daughter.\\
265 - But don't worry,\\
266 - I'm still going to marry her.\\
267 - Damn straight, you are.\\
268 - Which brings me to my question.\\
269 - When a man gets to be your age and he's never married,\\
270 - it's usually for one of two reasons. One...\\
271 - He's really lucky.\\
272 - You're right, not funny, go on.\\
273 - What I'm tryin' to say is,\\
274 - when a man gets to be 40 and he isn't married,\\
275 - he's either a rascal or a poof.\\
276 - Interesting.\\
277 - So? So what?\\
278 - So which one are you?\\
279 - Uh... actually, there's a third choice.\\
280 - What's that?\\
281 - Well, sometimes it takes a while\\
282 - for a man to meet his soul mate,\\
283 - like I finally met your daughter.\\
284 - Soul mate? Yep.\\
285 - So, poof.\\
286 - Oh, just kiddin'.\\
287 - How are my two favorite fellas doing?\\
288 - We're just fine, princess.\\
289 - I just cleaned the grill\\
290 - and now I'm givin' your beau here a grillin'.\\
291 - Well, stick a fork in me, 'cause I think I'm done.\\
292 - Sorry, honey, my dad's always been a little overprotective.\\
293 - Well, I have to be.\\
294 - When it comes to men, you've always had a rotten picker.\\
295 - No offense. I'm sure you're the exception.\\
296 - I'm glad you're sure.\\
297 - Dad, why don't you go see how mom's doing.\\
298 - Oh, good idea.\\
299 - She's jet-lagged and still pretty wound up\\
300 - over having a Colored pilot.\\
301 - What can I say?\\
302 - Mommy and Daddy are horrible bigots?\\
303 - But they're my parents, and I gotta love 'em, right?\\
304 - You're askin' the wrong guy.\\
305 - Look at them though.\\
306 - 42 years together\\
307 - and they're still best friends.\\
308 - Well, let's face it.\\
309 - Who else would have them?\\
310 - At least they don't lie to each other.\\
311 - Okay, I get it.\\
312 - I lied about the colonoscopy.\\
313 - Trust me, I've been punished enough.\\
314 - I'm just saying, if our marriage is going to last,\\
315 - we have to make a commitment\\
316 - to always be honest with each other.\\
317 - You have my word.\\
318 - You've given me your word before.\\
319 - Well, then you'd be silly to take it again, wouldn't you?\\
320 - What? I'm being honest.\\
321 - So, how are you liking Los Angeles?\\
322 - Well, the weather's lovely.\\
323 - Oh, it is, isn't it?\\
324 - What we don't care for are the freeways and Mexicans.\\
325 - Yeah, yeah, they-they do get congested.\\
326 - I think it's all the cheese they cook with.\\
327 - How's everybody getting along out here?\\
328 - Oh, everything's fine, dear.\\
329 - Remember what we talked about?\\
330 - No politics, religion or what have you.\\
331 - You don't have to tell me twice.\\
332 - I'm not a Polack.\\
333 - Hey, Charlie, when we drove in,\\
334 - I noticed a tavern down the road.\\
335 - How about you and I go out for a drink?\\
336 - Get to know each other a little better.\\
337 - Uh... sure, I guess.\\
338 - Although, if you're on the fence about me now,\\
339 - alcohol isn't going to really improve my chances.\\
340 - I think it's a terrific idea.\\
341 - You boys have fun. All right.\\
342 - I'm buying.\\
343 - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going?\\
344 - He said he's buying.\\
345 - Who would have thought that the best part of my day\\
346 - would be having a colonoscopy?\\
347 - * Men. *\\
348 - To my future son-in-law.\\
349 - Down the hatch.\\
350 - Considering my day,\\
351 - it'd be more like "up the hatch."\\
352 - Cheers.\\
353 - So, Alan, Chelsea tells me you're a chiropractor.\\
354 - I imagine you give a great back rub.\\
355 - Uh, well, I do, but there's a lot more involved than that.\\
356 - I like back rubs.\\
357 - But I need strong hands on me.\\
358 - Martha's got these little parrot claws,\\
359 - can't get deep in the muscle.\\
360 - Let me see what you got.\\
361 - Hmm. No calluses.\\
362 - I prefer the feel of calluses.\\
363 - If you want to see calluses,\\
364 - check the inside of his right palm.\\
365 - (men giggling)\\
366 - Look at that.\\
367 - You don't see that where I come from.\\
368 - Oh, come on,\\
369 - there's no gay people where you live?\\
370 - Of course there are, but they got their own bar.\\
371 - Little place called "The Log Cabin."\\
372 - On Forrester Street.\\
373 - Right next to the A&W.\\
374 - (playing on jukebox): * Yes, I'm on my way...\\
375 - Amazing that people in California\\
376 - can behave that way in public.\\
377 - Well, we kinda believe in live and let live.\\
378 - Oh, that's baloney.\\
379 - I believe in the sanctity of the family,\\
380 - marriage between a man and a woman.\\
381 - * Yes, I'm on my way...\\
382 - But, damn, those fellas do look happy.\\
383 - Probably 'cause in California they can't get married.\\
384 - Really, really happy.\\
385 - * Men. *\\
386 - (laughs) Down the hatch.\\
387 - Looks like my future father-in-law\\
388 - has made some new friends.\\
389 - Yeah. I'm a little confused.\\
390 - I don't think you're the only one.\\
391 - * Do you really want to make me cry. *\\
392 - Oh, I love that song.\\
393 - I hit it out of the park\\
394 - on karaoke night at the VFW.\\
395 - Chelsea didn't tell me you're a vet.\\
396 - Yeah, Navy.\\
397 - Submarine Corps.\\
398 - Oh, six month tours under the polar ice cap.\\
399 - Nothing to do but lift weights, shoot the bull\\
400 - and enjoy the company of other men.\\
401 - Six months with just men?\\
402 - Not just men.\\
403 - Young men.\\
404 - Hard men.\\
405 - And the hardest of them all was Edward Boyton,\\
406 - Seaman Third Class,\\
407 - and my best pal.\\
408 - 1966, we were in the Philippines for a week of R & R,\\
409 - and we bought matching shirts.\\
410 - Of course you did.\\
411 - Oh, I remember one night,\\
412 - it was real hot and humid.\\
413 - I can still see the wet silk\\
414 - clinging to his magnificent body.\\
415 - Did you see this coming?\\
416 - Uh-uh.\\
417 - Then after we did our hitch, we both went our separate ways,\\
418 - got married, raised kids.\\
419 - We still exchange Christmas cards\\
420 - and family photos every year.\\
421 - Terrific. Great, great. Okay.\\
422 - Why don't we drink up and go home.\\
423 - He's still in great shape.\\
424 - 65 years old and solid as a rock.\\
425 - He lives in Valencia.\\
426 - Hey, how far is that from here?\\
427 - Not so far.\\
428 - It's right next to Magic Mountain.\\
429 - It's far, Alan.\\
430 - Real far.\\
431 - Right, right, it-it's far.\\
432 - Come on, let's get you home to your lovely wife.\\
433 - Oh, she means well, but she doesn't understand me.\\
434 - Well, you're obviously a complicated man.\\
435 - Now, come on,\\
436 - we've got a big day tomorrow.\\
437 - Universal Studios, then Grauman's Chinese Theatre...\\
438 - I want to go to Valencia.\\
439 - Okay, we'll pencil it in.\\
440 - See if we have time.\\
441 - I want to go now!\\
442 - I want to see Ed!\\
443 - Yeah, but Ed is probably asleep.\\
444 - You know, with his wife. You want to know a secret?\\
445 - No, no, that's okay. Don't ask, don't tell.\\
446 - That's our philosophy.\\
447 - I brought my silk shirt\\
448 - and a VHS copy of Ice Station Zebra\\
449 - just in case, but shh.\\
450 - ALAN: You know who was great in that movie?\\
451 - Rock Hudson. Shut up.\\
452 - * Men. *\\
453 - You guys have fun?\\
454 - Oh, yeah.\\
455 - My dad's really something, isn't he?\\
456 - Uh-huh.\\
457 - Kind of a man's man.\\
458 - You could say that.\\
459 - TOM: I'm telling you, Martha, I can't live this lie anymore!\\
460 - MARTHA: You're drunk!\\
461 - Now come to bed. No!\\
462 - It's a bed of lies!\\
463 - I love Edward Boyton and he loves me!\\
464 - What the hell is happening?\\
465 - I don't know, but I have a feeling\\
466 - your dad's going to Magic Mountain tomorrow.\\
467 - * Men. *\\
468 - * Men. *\\
469 - Hey.\\
470 - You get your mom on the plane okay?\\
471 - Yeah.\\
472 - How's she doing?\\
473 - Pretty shook up.\\
474 - It's not every day your husband tells you\\
475 - he's leaving you for a 65-year-old man.\\
476 - What bothers her more,\\
477 - that her marriage is over or that her ex-husband\\
478 - is now promoting the homosexual agenda.\\
479 - I'm not in the mood, Charlie.\\
480 - You took my dad to the hotel?\\
481 - Yeah. Yeah.\\
482 - I met this Edward Boyton he's been talking about.\\
483 - Nice guy.\\
484 - Oh, yeah?\\
485 - Black guy.\\
486 - Really?\\
487 - Can I be the one to tell your mom?\\
488 - I'm going to go lay down.\\
489 - Hey, Chels?\\
490 - What?\\
491 - Given everything that's gone down with your dad,\\
492 - I'm off the hook on the whole lying to you\\
493 - about the colonoscopy thing, right?\\
494 - Right.\\
495 - Isn't it nice when things work out?
\subsection {Episode 14: Crude and Uncalled For}
1 - * Men.\\
2 - Mmm, oh, and here's another money saver:\\
3 - If you buy a big bag of irregular socks,\\
4 - you can pair up the good ones\\
5 - and use the cash you save for underwear.\\
6 - Good to know.\\
7 - And you can use the leftover misfit socks\\
8 - for dusting gloves, golf club cozies, even a hand puppet.\\
9 - A hand puppet?\\
10 - Oh, sure, couple of buttons for eyes, and you're ready to go.\\
11 - Hello, pretty lady.\\
12 - That's funny.\\
13 - So, you done the Internet dating thing before?\\
14 - All the time. Oh, and if you're interested,\\
15 - I know a couple of tricks to weed out the losers.\\
16 - I'm very interested.\\
17 - Hey, how are ya?\\
18 - Hi.\\
19 - Oh, you know him?\\
20 - No.\\
21 - Oh, talking to strange women.\\
22 - Must be drunk.\\
23 - Anyway, my profile says that I am a chiropractor,\\
24 - but I also do a lot of holistic work, you know\\
25 - acupressure, deep tissue massage,\\
26 - both of which promote a general sense of well being\\
27 - and also a heightened sexual sensitivity.\\
28 - (chuckles)\\
29 - Assuming, of course,\\
30 - your sexual sensitivity requires heightening.\\
31 - I have absolutely no intention of sleeping with you, Alan.\\
32 - Whoa, whoa, where'd that come from? (chuckles)\\
33 - I'm just talking about my job.\\
34 - Making conversation.\\
35 - And when you say "absolutely no intention,"\\
36 - you just mean tonight, right?\\
37 - Um, you look like you could use another one of these.\\
38 - You're a mind reader.\\
39 - Uh, excuse me,\\
40 - but, uh, I'm with this lady,\\
41 - and if she would like another drink,\\
42 - I am more than capable of providing one.\\
43 - But the dinner's still dutch.\\
44 - What's your name?\\
45 - Uh, Louanne.\\
46 - Hi, Louanne, I'm Marcus.\\
47 - All right, all right,\\
48 - fun time's over.\\
49 - Look, Marcus, the lady is on\\
50 - a date with me, and you are intruding.\\
51 - Why don't we ask the lady what she wants?\\
52 - Not necessary. I can tell you what she wants and it's not me.\\
53 - But there is a principle involved\\
54 - and that is one\\
55 - of poaching another man's gal.\\
56 - Is that so?\\
57 - Yes, that's so. Now take a hike.\\
58 - Why don't you just sit down and finish your peanuts?\\
59 - Don't you touch me!\\
60 - Hey, hey, calm down.\\
61 - You're right, you're right.\\
62 - We should just, uh, take a deep breath\\
63 - and calm down.\\
64 - That's a good idea.\\
65 - So, what are you doing after Potsie here drops you off?\\
66 - Hey, Marcus?\\
67 - How's that, bitch?!\\
68 - * Men.\\
69 - What are you doing in there?\\
70 - Be patient.\\
71 - I got you a surprise.\\
72 - You hear that?\\
73 - She got us a surprise.\\
74 - (phone rings)\\
75 - You gonna grab that?\\
76 - You'll have to be more specific.\\
77 - Answer the phone, Charlie.\\
78 - Right, right.\\
79 - Hello?\\
80 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, slow down.\\
81 - Who is this?\\
82 - Oh, hi, Alan.\\
83 - Not a good time right now.\\
84 - Really?\\
85 - What the hell are you doing in jail?\\
86 - You're kidding me.\\
87 - That's hilarious!\\
88 - (laughs)\\
89 - All right, all right, I'm on my way.\\
90 - What do you think?\\
91 - Doing-oing-oing-oing!\\
92 - I was gonna save it for our wedding night,\\
93 - but I couldn't wait.\\
94 - Oh, baby, by the time we get married,\\
95 - that thing's gonna be half-eaten.\\
96 - Who was on the phone?\\
97 - Alan.\\
98 - Everything all right?\\
99 - Yeah, he was just callin' to say he wouldn't be home tonight.\\
100 - Oh, did he get lucky?\\
101 - Not yet, but the night is still young.\\
102 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
103 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
104 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
105 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
106 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
107 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
108 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
109 - * Men.\\
110 - Ten hours!\\
111 - Ten hours I sat in that urine-soaked jail cell!\\
112 - You shouldn't have peed yourself.\\
113 - You said you'd be right there!\\
114 - Look, look, I understand your anger,\\
115 - but you gotta see it from my side.\\
116 - What's your side?\\
117 - I get really sleepy after sex!\\
118 - What's going on?\\
119 - Oh, your gallant fianc  \\
120 - let his baby brother rot in a prison cell all night.\\
121 - What?\\
122 - I've been there plenty of times.\\
123 - You slip the booking officer a $20,\\
124 - he'll send out for Starbucks.\\
125 - You know I don't carry that kind of cash.\\
126 - Regardless, it was just one night.\\
127 - Nobody took your man cherry, did they?\\
128 - Was that why Alan called last night?\\
129 - Uh... I assume so.\\
130 - Oh, Charlie.\\
131 - Hey, hey, you had that sexy lingerie on\\
132 - and you were so beautiful,\\
133 - plus you know how\\
134 - I hate to waste an erection.\\
135 - I can't believe you abandoned your brother when he needed you.\\
136 - It's horrible.\\
137 - How did I become the bad guy in all this?\\
138 - He's the felon!\\
139 - Why were you in jail, Alan?\\
140 - I was forced to use my hands to defend a lady's honor.\\
141 - Ask him what happened to the lady.\\
142 - She drove the guy I punched\\
143 - to the emergency room.\\
144 - I don't understand. Why would she go with him\\
145 - if you were defending her honor?\\
146 - Who knows? I would've asked her,\\
147 - but I was busy being handcuffed and dragged off to jail!\\
148 - Where I spent the night covering my behind with a food tray.\\
149 - Shame on you, Charlie Harper.\\
150 - Now she's mad at me.\\
151 - Happy?\\
152 - Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled!\\
153 - If my transsexual biker cell mate had only been\\
154 - a little more affectionate, my life would now be perfect!\\
155 - * Men.\\
156 - I don't know. I just snapped and hit him.\\
157 - It's the first time in my life that's ever happened.\\
158 - You mean it's the first time you've ever won.\\
159 - The important thing now is for you to know\\
160 - that your family is a hundred percent behind you.\\
161 - Thanks, Mom.\\
162 - Now, before we waste money on some expensive lawyer,\\
163 - how much jail time are we talking about\\
164 - if you just roll over?\\
165 - I don't want to go to jail!\\
166 - And if he does, he certainly doesn't want to roll over.\\
167 - Charles, that is crude and uncalled for.\\
168 - Thank you.\\
169 - You're welcome.\\
170 - Nobody wants to go to jail,\\
171 - sweetie, but let's face it,\\
172 - if all we're talking about is 60 days alone in a room\\
173 - with no friends, how is that different from two months\\
174 - squatting in your brother's house?\\
175 - You're kidding, right?\\
176 - I guess.\\
177 - You know what? Don't worry yourself.\\
178 - I'll just get a public defender and take care of this myself.\\
179 - There you go, problem solved.\\
180 - Charlie?\\
181 - What? Some kid out of law school\\
182 - hungry to make his bones. What's wrong with that?\\
183 - He gets his hair cut by trainees at the barber college.\\
184 - Alan, I'd be happy to help you hire a lawyer.\\
185 - Oh, no, Chelsea, I couldn't take money from you.\\
186 - That's an honor he reserves for family.\\
187 - So, what, you guys really aren't gonna help him?\\
188 - Well, of course we are.\\
189 - But if we didn't torture him a little bit,\\
190 - he wouldn't feel comfortable accepting our help.\\
191 - You don't know that. Try me!\\
192 - I'll tell you what. I'll find the lawyer,\\
193 - and we'll split the fee.\\
194 - Not fifty-fifty, 'cause I'm out six years of room,\\
195 - board and incidentals.\\
196 - And by incidentals, I mean mostly Kleenex and hand lotion.\\
197 - Oh, please, I paid\\
198 - for four years of college and chiropractor school,\\
199 - and he still gives me handmade tchotchkes for Christmas.\\
200 - You said you loved the pot holders I made you.\\
201 - I said they made me cry.\\
202 - Okay, okay, okay, fifty-fifty.\\
203 - But we'll put it on my card so I get the miles.\\
204 - I can't believe you two.\\
205 - That's okay, Chelsea, I'm used to being treated this way.\\
206 - The mocking, the insults, the humiliation.\\
207 - It's all part of the festering ugliness of this family.\\
208 - See? He's fine with this.\\
209 - * Men.\\
210 - Thanks for coming, you guys.\\
211 - Your support means a lot.\\
212 - Thank her.\\
213 - If it was up to me,\\
214 - you'd be in San Quentin wearing lipstick and a mop wig.\\
215 - Okay, Mom, I gotta go.\\
216 - No, I love you.\\
217 - Okay. What?\\
218 - No, you're not bothering me.\\
219 - I'm happy to take care of it. Okay.\\
220 - Okay, bye-bye.\\
221 - Sorry. I just bought my mom a new computer,\\
222 - and it's opened up quite a can of worms.\\
223 - Ironic. I just bought my mom a can of worms.\\
224 - Brad Harlow.\\
225 - Are you Alan?\\
226 - No, no, no, I'm his brother Charlie.\\
227 - This is my fianc  e Chelsea.\\
228 - And this pasty-faced jughead is the family Rottweiler.\\
229 - I just want it on record\\
230 - that I am not by nature a violent man.\\
231 - My fuse is long,\\
232 - but it is attached to dynamite.\\
233 - Shut up.\\
234 - I'm payin' by the hour.\\
235 - Would you two just stop it.\\
236 - I'm sorry.\\
237 - That's all right. I have siblings, too.\\
238 - We tease each other constantly. You know, sometimes I think\\
239 - it's just easier than saying "I love you."\\
240 - Okay, well, I got some good news for you, Alan.\\
241 - Hey, when's the last time you heard that?\\
242 - I made some calls,\\
243 - and the fella you punched has\\
244 - quite a few alcohol-related priors,\\
245 - and is definitely not looking to press charges.\\
246 - So I don't have to go back to jail?\\
247 - You won't even see the inside of a courtroom.\\
248 - Oh, thank God!\\
249 - I can't go back to the joint again.\\
250 - All right, great, we're off the clock.\\
251 - What do I owe you?\\
252 - Eh, relax, you don't owe me anything.\\
253 - Even better. Thank you.\\
254 - Charlie. We... we have to pay you for your time.\\
255 - Oh, you hippie.\\
256 - Well, uh,\\
257 - well, you can always make a donation to my charity.\\
258 - What's that, Lawyers Without Yachts?\\
259 - (laughs)\\
260 - No...\\
261 - no, it's for inner city kids.\\
262 - They come out to my ranch once a month,\\
263 - you know, learn to ride horses, get out in the fresh air.\\
264 - Oh, that's wonderful.\\
265 - I love horses.\\
266 - I used to ride all the time.\\
267 - Shall I write you a check?\\
268 - No, no, no, no, I got it.\\
269 - Who do I make it out to?\\
270 - Danielle's Darlings.\\
271 - Who's Danielle?\\
272 - My late wife.\\
273 - Oh, I'm so sorry.\\
274 - Oh, thank you. Thank you.\\
275 - I started the charity to keep her memory alive.\\
276 - She loved horses.\\
277 - Crap. That's another zero.\\
278 - There you go.\\
279 - Wow. This is incredibly generous.\\
280 - Thank you.\\
281 - You're very welcome.\\
282 - You know, we're having a nature ride and barbecue\\
283 - for the kids this Saturday.\\
284 - You should come.\\
285 - Really? That sounds wonderful.\\
286 - Doesn't it, Charlie?\\
287 - Do the kids race the horses?\\
288 - What?\\
289 - No.\\
290 - There's no action?\\
291 - No action.\\
292 - I don't see the point.\\
293 - He's just joking.\\
294 - No, I'm not.\\
295 - I really don't see the point.\\
296 - Well, if you change your mind, here's the info.\\
297 - We'd love to see you.\\
298 - Thank you. Maybe we will.\\
299 - Great. Yeah, maybe.\\
300 - Thanks very much, Brad.\\
301 - Always nice to bring good news to a client.\\
302 - And the best news is,\\
303 - I think having a criminal record is really spice up\\
304 - my online dating profile.\\
305 - I might even post the mug shot.\\
306 - * Men.\\
307 - * Men.\\
308 - Wasn't Brad terrific?\\
309 - Who's Brad?\\
310 - Alan's lawyer.\\
311 - Uh, he's okay, I guess.\\
312 - You guess?\\
313 - Not only does he have a successful law practice,\\
314 - he's doing so much to help poor kids.\\
315 - What, by sticking them on horses?\\
316 - How's that going to help?\\
317 - Get them a high paying job with the pony express?\\
318 - It's not about jobs.\\
319 - It's about getting them out of the city\\
320 - and into the fresh air.\\
321 - Fresh air?\\
322 - Have you ever smelled a horse?\\
323 - You know what I mean.\\
324 - And did you hear the way he talked about family?\\
325 - They obviously mean a lot to him.\\
326 - Family also meant a lot to Charles Manson.\\
327 - That's a terrible thing to say.\\
328 - Sorry.\\
329 - Hey, speaking of horseback riding--\\
330 - why don't you hop on and I'll race you to the finish.\\
331 - You know what, I'm not really in the mood.\\
332 - That's okay. I've got enough mood for both of us.\\
333 - Good night, Charlie.\\
334 - But Charlie's a frustrated pony.\\
335 - Go to sleep.\\
336 - I was pretty charitable today.\\
337 - Mm-hmm.\\
338 - I guess the spirit of giving\\
339 - doesn't extend to the bedroom, huh?\\
340 - Good night, Charlie.\\
341 - (nickering)\\
342 - * Men.\\
343 - Hey. Hey.\\
344 - Can't sleep?\\
345 - Nope.\\
346 - Me neither.\\
347 - Even though I dodged the legal bullet,\\
348 - I've got all this stuff building up inside me.\\
349 - I'm afraid I'm going to explode.\\
350 - I'm afraid I won't.\\
351 - The other night in that bar, I just snapped.\\
352 - It was like I became a different person.\\
353 - Well, that had to be a nice break for you.\\
354 - I'm scared, Charlie.\\
355 - I mean, there was a part of me that really enjoyed\\
356 - driving my fist into that jerk's stupid face\\
357 - and watching him crumble to the floor in agony.\\
358 - So what are you scared of?\\
359 - What if this is just the beginning?\\
360 - What if I've awakened some long-dormant monster\\
361 - inside of me who revels in violence?\\
362 - What if I can't control the monster?\\
363 - What if the monster takes over?\\
364 - Ouchy!\\
365 - You're fine. Go to bed, monster.\\
366 - Okay, good night.\\
367 - * Men.\\
368 - What happened to your hand?\\
369 - Oh, well...\\
370 - I won't lie to you.\\
371 - I got into a bar fight\\
372 - and punched a guy in the face.\\
373 - Yeah, right.\\
374 - No, I'm serious. I spent the night in jail.\\
375 - Fine, don't tell me.\\
376 - I was just trying to make conversation.\\
377 - Hey, I am warning you.\\
378 - There is a monster inside of me\\
379 - and you don't want to wake him up.\\
380 - Oh! Oh! Hot, hot.\\
381 - Did the monster burn his mouth with his chamomile tea?\\
382 - It's oolong.\\
383 - Where's Chelsea?\\
384 - She went to that charity thing\\
385 - for inner city horses.\\
386 - You let her go without you?\\
387 - Why the hell would I want to go?\\
388 - I hate kids and I'm scared of horses.\\
389 - Maybe you didn't notice the way my lawyer\\
390 - was looking at your fianc  e.\\
391 - What are you talking about?\\
392 - Or the way she was looking back at him.\\
393 - That's ridiculous.\\
394 - I'm telling you, there were definitely sparks\\
395 - between the two of them.\\
396 - You think?\\
397 - Charlie, that guy is everything you're not.\\
398 - Well, what's that mean?\\
399 - He likes people, he loves his mother,\\
400 - he works with children\\
401 - and he doesn't stumble through life\\
402 - stinking of whiskey and KY Jelly.\\
403 - Hey, hey, hey, KY Jelly is odorless.\\
404 - Not where you put it.\\
405 - I'm just saying that if Chelsea were my fianc  e,\\
406 - I wouldn't leave her alone with this guy.\\
407 - If Chelsea were your fianc  e,\\
408 - you'd have bigger problems.\\
409 - Like what?\\
410 - Like being the last man on Earth.\\
411 - * Men.\\
412 - I don't understand why I have to go to this thing.\\
413 - Because your uncle wants to use you\\
414 - to camouflage his growing fear\\
415 - that his girlfriend might be interested in another guy.\\
416 - Hey, hey, hey. I have no fear.\\
417 - Of course not.\\
418 - You just got a sudden craving\\
419 - for barbecue and horses.\\
420 - Whoa, there's gonna be barbecued horses?\\
421 - Cool.\\
422 - Where the hell is this lawyer's stupid ranch?\\
423 - You must have passed the turnoff.\\
424 - Maybe we should put the GPS back on.\\
425 - I don't need the GPS.\\
426 - GPS: Take the next legal U-turn.\\
427 - Then proceed 22 miles to main road.\\
428 - Okay, turn around.\\
429 - There's no room.\\
430 - Well, then back up.\\
431 - 22 miles?\\
432 - Just till you find a place to turn.\\
433 - I'm hungry.\\
434 - We're almost there.\\
435 - I don't think so. I'd smell the barbecue.\\
436 - Jake, would you pipe down\\
437 - so I can concen...?\\
438 - Oh, damn.\\
439 - You have reached your destination.\\
440 - (sniffs)\\
441 - I don't think so.\\
442 - * Men.\\
443 - Un-freakin'-believable.\\
444 - Still no signal.\\
445 - Well, of course, there's no signal.\\
446 - We're in the middle of nowhere.\\
447 - I'm starving.\\
448 - What do you want from me? Go catch a squirrel.\\
449 - This is why I always tell you\\
450 - to keep an emergency kit in your car.\\
451 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
452 - No matter what happens, I know that in my trunk\\
453 - is a thermal blanket, flashlight, batteries,\\
454 - bottled water and assorted protein bars.\\
455 - You hear that, Jake?\\
456 - You have an inheritance.\\
457 - I already ate the protein bars.\\
458 - You were right, Alan.\\
459 - The more time Chelsea spends with this Brad guy,\\
460 - the more time she's going to have to contrast and compare.\\
461 - And I'm not going to come out of that looking so good.\\
462 - If you're really worried about her being attracted\\
463 - to a better man than you,\\
464 - why don't you become a better man?\\
465 - (mocking tone): Why don't you become a better man?\\
466 - Yeah, like that.\\
467 - * Men.\\
468 - You guys think there are mountain lions up here?\\
469 - Hadn't given it much thought.\\
470 - Till just now.\\
471 - Relax. There's no mountain lions here.\\
472 - You know, this is where it normally goes bad\\
473 - in slasher movies.\\
474 - One guy falls back a little bit,\\
475 - usually to smoke pot or have sex,\\
476 - and he gets his head hacked off.\\
477 - Let that be a lesson to you about drugs and premarital sex.\\
478 - Good parenting, Alan. Thank you.\\
479 - (growling)\\
480 - ALAN: Mountain lion! Mountain lion! Run! Run!\\
481 - Oh, crap! Hey, guys wait up!\\
482 - (screaming)\\
483 - Psych.\\
484 - * Men.\\
485 - * Men.\\
486 - I can't believe you really thought I was a mountain lion.\\
487 - Go to your room.\\
488 - You're punishing me just because you're gullible?\\
489 - Yeah, pretty much.\\
490 - (Jake growling)\\
491 - Still not funny!\\
492 - Chelsea's not home.\\
493 - How could she not be home yet?\\
494 - That thing was over hours ago.\\
495 - Are you worried she might be cheating on you with Brad?\\
496 - No, I was thinking car trouble, but thanks for that.\\
497 - Sorry.\\
498 - Look, Chelsea and I have been together for over a year now.\\
499 - We're engaged to be married.\\
500 - What are the odds she's going to leave me for some lawyer\\
501 - just because he's kind, rich, handsome, generous,\\
502 - loves his family and named a charity after his dead wife?\\
503 - I don't know, even money?\\
504 - At least.\\
505 - So ten bucks just to make it interesting?\\
506 - (slap) ALAN: Ouchy!
\subsection {Episode 15: Aye, Aye, Captain Douche}
1 - I was forced to use my hands to defend a lady's honor.\\
2 - So I don't have to go back to jail?\\
3 - You won't even see the inside of a courtroom.\\
4 - You know, we're having a nature ride\\
5 - and barbecue for the kids\\
6 - this Saturday. You should come.\\
7 - That sounds wonderful, doesn't it, Charlie?\\
8 - You let her go without you?\\
9 - Why the hell would I want to go?\\
10 - Maybe you didn't notice the way\\
11 - my lawyer was looking at your fianc  e.\\
12 - What are you talking about?\\
13 - Or the way she was looking back at him.\\
14 - Charlie, that guy is everything you're not.\\
15 - * Men. *\\
16 - Where the hell is she, Alan?\\
17 - Calm down; don't work yourself into a tizzy.\\
18 - A tizzy?\\
19 - I don't have tizzies.\\
20 - Women have tizzies. You have tizzies.\\
21 - Me, I am outraged, I am furious, I am, I am...\\
22 - Miffed?\\
23 - Do not complete my sentences\\
24 - if you don't grasp the concept.\\
25 - Sorry.\\
26 - She should've been home hours ago.\\
27 - I'm sure there's a perfectly good explanation.\\
28 - Oh, really? And what would that be?\\
29 - Okay, well, after the barbecue ended,\\
30 - Chelsea stayed behind to help clean up.\\
31 - And then she and Brad got to talking\\
32 - about all the things they have in common.\\
33 - You know, their love of horses, children...\\
34 - Probably just lost track of time.\\
35 - Because, you know, he's so easy to talk to.\\
36 - Not to mention how...\\
37 - good-looking he is.\\
38 - Or she got diarrhea.\\
39 - Oh, maybe she called.\\
40 - Oh, look, there's two messages.\\
41 - WOMAN: Hi. I'm calling for Alan Harper.\\
42 - This is Jenny from Malibu Day Spa.\\
43 - I just wanted to confirm your Saturday appointment\\
44 - for a bikini wax.\\
45 - Bikini wax?!\\
46 - Uh, I wear a European-cut bathing suit.\\
47 - I like to keep it tidy down there.\\
48 - Anyway, I'm sure the next one is Chelsea.\\
49 - Hi, Mr. Harper. This is Jenny again.\\
50 - Just a reminder-- we can no longer accept\\
51 - a personal check from you...\\
52 - I should've just gone with her to that stupid charity thing.\\
53 - True. If you'd made a little effort,\\
54 - you wouldn't be in this situation.\\
55 - But I bet she knew I wouldn't go\\
56 - when she asked me.\\
57 - In fact, I bet she was counting on me not going,\\
58 - so she could be alone with this Brad guy.\\
59 - Do you really think Chelsea would do something like that?\\
60 - Why not? That's what I'd do.\\
61 - I mean, hypothetically.\\
62 - If I were ever in that situation.\\
63 - Again.\\
64 - Right.\\
65 - The point is, I've been honest through this whole thing.\\
66 - She's the one who's been deceitful.\\
67 - She's nothing but a manipulative,\\
68 - calculating, two-faced...\\
69 - Hey, honey.\\
70 - (sweetly): Oh, hi, baby.\\
71 - How was the party?\\
72 - It was great.\\
73 - There was, like, 80 kids taking turns riding a horse\\
74 - for the first time in their lives.\\
75 - So, what, there was just one horse?\\
76 - No.\\
77 - Good, 'cause that would've been\\
78 - a tough day for the horse.\\
79 - Sorry I'm late, but after we got the kids back on the busses,\\
80 - a bunch of us hung out to chat and help clean up.\\
81 - Yeah, yeah, that's what I figured.\\
82 - Anyway, I'm beat.\\
83 - I just want to jump in the shower and go to bed.\\
84 - Okay, I'll be right up.\\
85 - Night, Alan. Night.\\
86 - Glad you had a good time.\\
87 - Well done.\\
88 - You sublimated your anger and came from a place of love.\\
89 - You took the high road.\\
90 - Really?\\
91 - Is that what you call it?\\
92 - 'Cause I call it a complete and total betrayal\\
93 - of my testicles.\\
94 - If you'd done it as much as I had,\\
95 - you'd call it the high road.\\
96 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
97 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
98 - * Men. *\\
99 - Hey, Chels?\\
100 - So, when you say a bunch of you stayed to clean up,\\
101 - how many are you talking about?\\
102 - I don't know; a couple.\\
103 - Uh-huh.\\
104 - You know, technically, a couple is two.\\
105 - So are you saying there were two people\\
106 - in addition to you and Brad or just you and Brad?\\
107 - What are you getting at?\\
108 - Nothing. Just trying to get an accurate head count.\\
109 - You could've come with me, you know.\\
110 - I know.\\
111 - It'd be nice for us\\
112 - to do some things together once in a while.\\
113 - We do plenty of things together.\\
114 - Besides sex.\\
115 - Oh...\\
116 - When Brad's wife was alive, they played tennis every day.\\
117 - Probably what killed her.\\
118 - She was hit by a car.\\
119 - Maybe she was chasing a tennis ball.\\
120 - You know, like a dog.\\
121 - You throw it, they run after it,\\
122 - even if there's traffic...\\
123 - Goofy dogs.\\
124 - * Men. *\\
125 - (crowd cheering)\\
126 - What the hell is that?\\
127 - Two guys in a cage beating the snot out of each other.\\
128 - I can't believe I wasted so many years watching cartoons.\\
129 - Turn it down.\\
130 - Aye, aye, Captain Douche.\\
131 - What did you say?\\
132 - Aye, aye, Captain. I'll do that.\\
133 - Why are you on the couch? You and Chelsea have a fight?\\
134 - No, we didn't have a fight.\\
135 - Were you farting in your sleep?\\
136 - No.\\
137 - Did you screw up the sex?\\
138 - What the hell are you talking about?\\
139 - You know, there's more than one way to satisfy a woman.\\
140 - Oh, really? Like what?\\
141 - I'm not sure.\\
142 - But I have some theories.\\
143 - Get out!\\
144 - Fine.\\
145 - We wouldn't have these problems if you just put a TV in my room.\\
146 - We wouldn't have these problems\\
147 - if I just put a python in your room.\\
148 - Touch  , douch  .\\
149 - What?\\
150 - I said touch  , douch  .\\
151 - BERTA: * I really can't stay\\
152 - (in deep voice): * Baby, it's cold outside\\
153 - (normal voice): * I've got to go away\\
154 - (deep voice): * Baby, it's cold outside...\\
155 - You mind? I'm trying to sleep.\\
156 - Hey, I didn't see you there.\\
157 - What'd you do?\\
158 - I don't want to talk about it.\\
159 - Fine. I'm not one to pry.\\
160 - Money?\\
161 - No.\\
162 - Old girlfriend?\\
163 - No.\\
164 - She find those Polaroids?\\
165 - No.\\
166 - How did you know about the Polaroids?\\
167 - You just told me, you dirtbag.\\
168 - So, what did you do,\\
169 - try to sneak in at 2:00 a.m.\\
170 - smellin' of booze and pole dancer?\\
171 - For your information, Chelsea's the one who came home late.\\
172 - And she was smelling of horse.\\
173 - Oh, good Lord, Charlie, you can't compete with a horse.\\
174 - Yeah, yeah, yeah...\\
175 - Seriously.\\
176 - I've seen your tallywacker,\\
177 - and you're blessed, but you ain't no Seabiscuit.\\
178 - When have you seen my... tallywacker?\\
179 - I don't know, maybe the nine or ten times I found you passed out\\
180 - in your bathtub, holding onto it like it was a flotation device.\\
181 - Sorry about that.\\
182 - Don't be.\\
183 - Mmm, boy!\\
184 - Breakfast,\\
185 - the most important meal of the day.\\
186 - Three scrambled egg whites,\\
187 - two slices of "I can't believe it's not buttered" rye toast\\
188 - and to flush it through me,\\
189 - a piping hot cup of freshly ground coffee.\\
190 - (coffee grinder whirring)\\
191 - Shut that thing off!\\
192 - (whirring resumes)\\
193 - (crashing)\\
194 - So... decaf?\\
195 - Don't push me.\\
196 - I'm not in the mood.\\
197 - Did you sleep on the couch last night?\\
198 - What's it to ya?\\
199 - Oh, Charlie, what'd you do?\\
200 - Nothing. Nothing?\\
201 - I may have compared Brad's recently deceased wife\\
202 - to a ball-chasing dog.\\
203 - Whose balls?\\
204 - Tennis balls.\\
205 - Get your mind out of the gutter.\\
206 - All right, look-- while this is admittedly a bump in the road,\\
207 - you do have an opportunity here\\
208 - to really improve your relationship with Chelsea.\\
209 - How do you figure?\\
210 - Well, think about it--\\
211 - the reason you're threatened by Brad\\
212 - is because he's a much better man than you.\\
213 - No, he's not.\\
214 - I would never come on to another guy's fianc  e.\\
215 - Okay, first of all, we don't know\\
216 - that he's come on to Chelsea.\\
217 - And secondly, I've seen you hit on a bride\\
218 - while she was walking down the aisle.\\
219 - That was a joke.\\
220 - I asked her what she was doing later. Everybody laughed.\\
221 - My point is, if Chelsea is looking around for a better guy,\\
222 - why not make that guy you?\\
223 - Because I'm not a better guy than me.\\
224 - Not yet.\\
225 - But you do have something going for you that Brad doesn't.\\
226 - What's that?\\
227 - Room to improve.\\
228 - Lots and lots of room to improve.\\
229 - Thanks. You've filled me with optimism.\\
230 - And keep in mind, you're the underdog here,\\
231 - and everybody loves an underdog.\\
232 - Then how come nobody loves you?\\
233 - The principle is still sound.\\
234 - Just go up there and tell Chelsea you know\\
235 - that you're a flawed human being,\\
236 - but that you will spend the rest of your life trying to be better\\
237 - because she deserves the best.\\
238 - So, lie.\\
239 - You don't have to lie.\\
240 - Don't you think you're a flawed human being?\\
241 - Of course I do. But I know me.\\
242 - I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life doing anything,\\
243 - let alone try to be a better human being.\\
244 - Oh, come on, Charlie.\\
245 - Look at every New Year's resolution I've ever made.\\
246 - I've got the best of intentions, but by January third or fourth,\\
247 - there I am broke, hung over, and coughing up stripper glitter.\\
248 - Okay, lie.\\
249 - * Men. *\\
250 - Hey Chels... I brought you some orange juice.\\
251 - Thank you.\\
252 - Is there any coffee?\\
253 - No, no, my stupid brother broke the grinder.\\
254 - There's vodka in this orange juice.\\
255 - Whoopsie, that's mine.\\
256 - It's 8:00 in the morning.\\
257 - Hence the orange juice.\\
258 - So, listen, I wanted to apologize again\\
259 - about my unfortunate remarks last night.\\
260 - And tell you I love you and I'll spend the rest of my life\\
261 - trying to be a better man because you deserve the best.\\
262 - Well, I appreciate you saying that.\\
263 - So... we're good?\\
264 - Yeah.\\
265 - Great.\\
266 - So what do you want to do today?\\
267 - Your choice-- whatever makes you happy. Really?\\
268 - I'll go anywhere, I'll do anything.\\
269 - Of course, you'll have to drive.\\
270 - Well, I was thinking of going to Beverly Hills\\
271 - for this charity blood drive.\\
272 - Great.\\
273 - We'll give blood together.\\
274 - than tapping a vein for a good cause.\\
275 - Terrific. Brad will be happy to see us.\\
276 - Brad?\\
277 - It's his charity.\\
278 - He's got another charity?\\
279 - What the hell's this guy's problem?\\
280 - It's not a problem, Charlie.\\
281 - He's a very caring and compassionate man.\\
282 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's a freakin' saint.\\
283 - And you were already planning on seeing him again.\\
284 - Well, yeah. He told me\\
285 - about the blood drive last night.\\
286 - Right, right, while you were "cleaning up."\\
287 - What's "this"?\\
288 - Oh, I think you know what "this" is.\\
289 - Just go to hell!\\
290 - Hey, hey-hey,\\
291 - I'm not the one sneakin' around seeing somebody\\
292 - behind my fianc  's back!\\
293 - I am not sneaking around!\\
294 - I asked you to go with me!\\
295 - Figuring that I wouldn't.\\
296 - Very sneaky!\\
297 - Drop dead!\\
298 - (grinder whirrs, revving up)\\
299 - Fixed it.\\
300 - * Men. *\\
301 - * Men. *\\
302 - So...\\
303 - when are you gonna call Chelsea and tell her you're sorry?\\
304 - Okay, first of all, I have nothing to be sorry about.\\
305 - And second, I am not gonna discuss my personal life\\
306 - with someone whose current girlfriend is a gym sock.\\
307 - Wow, no wonder she left.\\
308 - You just lash out for no reason.\\
309 - EVELYN: Hello?\\
310 - Out here!\\
311 - That's my reason.\\
312 - Boo-hoo. When you gonna stop\\
313 - blaming your problems on your mommy?\\
314 - Hey, boys.\\
315 - Charlie, where's your bride-to-be?\\
316 - We were gonna finalize the guest list.\\
317 - She's not here.\\
318 - She told him to go to hell.\\
319 - Will you please shut up?\\
320 - Oh, Charles, what did you do?\\
321 - I didn't do anything!\\
322 - He slept on the couch last night.\\
323 - Nobody's talking to you!\\
324 - And this is what we've been living with.\\
325 - Stop heating your socks in the microwave, you little freak!\\
326 - Charlie, please don't let this girl get away.\\
327 - Don't worry, I won't.\\
328 - Good, 'cause she's one in a million\\
329 - and you're a dime a dozen.\\
330 - Yeah, but I'm the underdog, and everybody loves the underdog.\\
331 - Oh, God, now you sound like your brother.\\
332 - How do you plan on getting her back?\\
333 - I'm gonna become a better man.\\
334 - Great, so no plan at all.\\
335 - * Men. *\\
336 - REPORTER: ...like Santee, California,\\
337 - maybe Long Beach, California, could actually top out around 90\\
338 - before it's all said and done.\\
339 - What's the forecast?\\
340 - (slurring): High tonight, low tomorrow.\\
341 - A hundred-percent chance of hangover.\\
342 - Heard from Chelsea?\\
343 - She's staying with her father for a few days.\\
344 - At least that's what she e-mailed me.\\
345 - You don't think she could be with...\\
346 - Go ahead, say it.\\
347 - Braa-ad!\\
348 - You know what?\\
349 - If she is, fine.\\
350 - Good riddance.\\
351 - I was never meant to be tied down to one woman, anyway.\\
352 - Well, you are by nature a free spirit.\\
353 - (sobbing): I miss her, Alan!\\
354 - I can't live without her!\\
355 - And you don't have to.\\
356 - Remember our talk?\\
357 - Becoming a better man?\\
358 - Screw it!\\
359 - I'm as good as I'm ever gonna be!\\
360 - If she doesn't like it, the hell with her!\\
361 - That is true. In a healthy relationship,\\
362 - your partner needs to accept you for who you are.\\
363 - (sobbing): Oh, she deserves better than me, Alan!\\
364 - She's such a wonderful gal!\\
365 - I know, I know.\\
366 - She's-she's like an angel!\\
367 - She... She sure is.\\
368 - Then why is she running off with Braa-ad?\\
369 - We don't know that she's running off with anyone.\\
370 - This is not angel behavior, Alan.\\
371 - You know what kind of behavior this is?\\
372 - Charlie behavior.\\
373 - (wailing): I took an angel and I turned her into me!\\
374 - * Men. *\\
375 - Charlie...?\\
376 - I can't sleep in my bed.\\
377 - It smells like Chelsea.\\
378 - O-Okay. Well...\\
379 - why don't you stay here\\
380 - and I'll go sleep in your room.\\
381 - No, no, no, don't go.\\
382 - I don't wanna be alone.\\
383 - All right.\\
384 - You're wearing pajama bottoms, right?\\
385 - Shh...\\
386 - Exactly how drunk are you?\\
387 - Both questions...\\
388 - asked and answered.\\
389 - * Men. *\\
390 - (phone rings)\\
391 - (curtly): What?\\
392 - Oh, hi, Chelsea.\\
393 - No... no, he's up.\\
394 - Or not.\\
395 - Hang on. I'll find him.\\
396 - Charlie?\\
397 - Charlie?\\
398 - Found him. Hold on.\\
399 - Hey, Charlie?\\
400 - What?\\
401 - You got a phone call.\\
402 - I'll call back.\\
403 - It's your fianc  e.\\
404 - (brightly): Oh, hey, baby.\\
405 - No, no, I've been up for a while.\\
406 - So how are ya?\\
407 - Uh-huh.\\
408 - What's going on?\\
409 - Man, you'll do anything\\
410 - not to kick in a little rent, won't ya?\\
411 - Are you coming home?\\
412 - I really miss you.\\
413 - Uh, sure, I can meet you for coffee, no problem.\\
414 - Half hour?\\
415 - No problem. See ya.\\
416 - (groans)\\
417 - Problem?\\
418 - What the hell are you doing here?\\
419 - * Men. *\\
420 - Hi, sweetie.\\
421 - Sorry I'm late.\\
422 - I got you some coffee.\\
423 - Thank you.\\
424 - (gulping)\\
425 - Isn't that awfully hot?\\
426 - Scalding!\\
427 - (raspy cough)\\
428 - Whew...\\
429 - So, what's new?\\
430 - We need to talk about Brad.\\
431 - No, no, we don't.\\
432 - I'm sorry.\\
433 - I trust you, and I was totally and completely wrong\\
434 - to think there might be something going on\\
435 - between you two.\\
436 - Thank you for that.\\
437 - You're welcome.\\
438 - Okay, let's go home.\\
439 - Hold on. I do have a confession to make.\\
440 - Oh, this is never good.\\
441 - The reason I got so upset\\
442 - by the things you said was because,\\
443 - well, you kind of touched a nerve.\\
444 - Yeah, I do that. I'm a nerve toucher.\\
445 - Runs in the family.\\
446 - Okay, well, confession's over.\\
447 - And you forgive me, I forgive you.\\
448 - Let's go home.\\
449 - I'm not done.\\
450 - Aw, crap.\\
451 - The thing is, I was kind of attracted to Brad.\\
452 - He's a great guy and we have a lot in common.\\
453 - He loves his family and he really cares\\
454 - about his friends and his community.\\
455 - I'm taking from your tone that stuff's important to you.\\
456 - Yes, Charlie, it's important to me.\\
457 - Okay.\\
458 - Did you and Brad do anything other than talk?\\
459 - Of course not.\\
460 - Nothing's happened.\\
461 - Oh, thank God.\\
462 - But while I do love you,\\
463 - I need to know you care as much as I do.\\
464 - I do.\\
465 - You say that,\\
466 - but are you willing\\
467 - to really work on our relationship?\\
468 - Of course I am.\\
469 - We can start doing things together; community things.\\
470 - You know, with the-the-the... the kids that are poor\\
471 - and the old people that fall and can't get up.\\
472 - What about your family?\\
473 - I'll get a new family.\\
474 - Look, I'm telling you, I can change.\\
475 - (gagging): I can be a better man; the man you want me to be.\\
476 - (gagging intensifies): And I promise you...\\
477 - Excuse me.\\
478 - (vomits)\\
479 - Oh, my God!\\
480 - I am so, so sorry.\\
481 - You threw up on my baby!\\
482 - (baby crying)\\
483 - Anyway, to be fair, I don't think the carrots were mine.\\
484 - Get away from him, you pig!\\
485 - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\\
486 - Cute kid.\\
487 - (baby crying)\\
488 - Chels?\\
489 - (sighs)\\
490 - Damn.\\
491 - * Men. *\\
492 - I just got a call from Chelsea.\\
493 - Oh, yeah?\\
494 - She said she wants to postpone the wedding.\\
495 - I know.\\
496 - I'm sorry.\\
497 - Thanks.\\
498 - Believe it or not, I do love you,\\
499 - and I hate to see you hurt.\\
500 - Yeah, well... I guess I kinda had it coming.\\
501 - But you tried.\\
502 - I did.\\
503 - I just have one question.\\
504 - What's that?\\
505 - Did you really vomit on a baby?\\
506 - Don't beat yourself up too much.\\
507 - We've all done that.\\
508 - You're kidding.\\
509 - Of course...most of us do it on our own babies.

1 - * Men.\\
2 - CHELSEA: First box goes in my car, the other in the truck.\\
3 - Guess that's it.\\
4 - You got everything?\\
5 - I think so.\\
6 - I, uh, left the house keys\\
7 - and the garage clicker by the nightstand.\\
8 - Thanks.\\
9 - So you still planning to move in with your dad?\\
10 - Just for a while.\\
11 - You gonna be okay?\\
12 - Me? Oh, yeah, yeah.\\
13 - I mean, I am gonna miss the cat.\\
14 - You hate Sir Lancelot.\\
15 - I did at first, but over time I came to find...\\
16 - Yeah, you're right.\\
17 - I hate that thing.\\
18 - I put in a change of address at the post office,\\
19 - but here's my dad's address just in case.\\
20 - I might be open to a trade.\\
21 - I'll keep the cat, you take Alan.\\
22 - Still got his carrier.\\
23 - Take care of yourself, Charlie.\\
24 - You do the same.\\
25 - I'm sorry it didn't work out.\\
26 - Me, too.\\
27 - (door closes)\\
28 - Well, she's gone.\\
29 - You handled that very maturely.\\
30 - What are you gonna do?\\
31 - We tried.\\
32 - Didn't work.\\
33 - Life goes on. Mmm.\\
34 - You want a drink?\\
35 - Nah. Drinking isn't gonna solve anything.\\
36 - What-what are you doing?\\
37 - Nothing.\\
38 - Really?\\
39 - Doesn't look like nothing.\\
40 - Where you going?\\
41 - Out for a swim.\\
42 - You never go in the water.\\
43 - That's 'cause I'm not a good swimmer.\\
44 - You don't think he's gonna...\\
45 - I don't know.\\
46 - Charlie? Charlie, stop this!\\
47 - Charlie, come back!\\
48 - It's not that bad!\\
49 - Come on, Charlie, you still got your family!\\
50 - Very smart; now he's sprinting.\\
51 - Damn it, Charlie, get out of that water!\\
52 - We need to go after him.\\
53 - Well, don't look at me.\\
54 - I just ate; I got to wait a half an hour.\\
55 - Well, I just took a shower and washed my hair.\\
56 - And this is leave-in conditioner.\\
57 - Well, what about Jake? Jake's at his mother's.\\
58 - Maybe we should give him a call. There's no time!\\
59 - Water's really cold.\\
60 - Just so you know,\\
61 - we were about to come get you!\\
62 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
63 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
64 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
65 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh... *\\
66 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
67 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men... *\\
68 - * Men.\\
69 - (knocking)\\
70 - ALAN: Charlie?\\
71 - You awake?\\
72 - Come on, man.\\
73 - It's time to get up.\\
74 - Charlie?\\
75 - What?\\
76 - (shrieks)\\
77 - I-I didn't see you there.\\
78 - She was the best thing that ever happened to me, Alan.\\
79 - I understand.\\
80 - But you've been up here for two days.\\
81 - It's time to move on with your life.\\
82 - There's no life to move on with.\\
83 - Oh, sure there is.\\
84 - You've got money, a beautiful home, good looks, all your hair.\\
85 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
86 - I have all the things you don't.\\
87 - That wasn't really the point I was trying to make, but, uh...\\
88 - Come on. Come on.\\
89 - Where are we going?\\
90 - We are going to get you cleaned up.\\
91 - No.\\
92 - No, I can't go in there.\\
93 - Reminds me too much of Chelsea.\\
94 - The bathroom?\\
95 - That's where she used to brush her hair and floss her teeth\\
96 - and tinkle like a princess.\\
97 - Okay.\\
98 - Well, where have you been tinkling?\\
99 - I may need a new ficus.\\
100 - * Men.\\
101 - I'm glad you came with me.\\
102 - You needed to get out of the house.\\
103 - No, what I need is to be loved again.\\
104 - Uh, well, I think a good first step\\
105 - is to stop urinating in the potted plants.\\
106 - Jake, your dad's here!\\
107 - Charlie, I was so sorry to hear about you and Chelsea.\\
108 - Thank you.\\
109 - I know that breakups can be\\
110 - very difficult.\\
111 - Unless you're kicking out your husband of 12 years.\\
112 - That seemed remarkably easy.\\
113 - It was.\\
114 - You know the part that I don't understand, Judith,\\
115 - is how somebody can tell you that they love you one day,\\
116 - then turn around and break your heart the next.\\
117 - Well, relationships are complicated.\\
118 - People drift apart.\\
119 - Nobody's to blame.\\
120 - You blamed me.\\
121 - It was your fault.\\
122 - I tried to change,\\
123 - tried to become the man she wanted me to be,\\
124 - but it wasn't enough.\\
125 - Oh, I'm sure there's a part of her\\
126 - that still loves you very much.\\
127 - Is there a part of you that still loves me very much?\\
128 - No.\\
129 - What's wrong with him?\\
130 - Your uncle's very upset about his breakup.\\
131 - Oh, yeah, that sucks.\\
132 - Can I drive?\\
133 - Sure. Cool.\\
134 - Let's go, crybaby.\\
135 - * Men.\\
136 - (Jake and girl talking quietly)\\
137 - (chuckles)\\
138 - Hey.\\
139 - Yeah, hey, kind of busy here.\\
140 - I can see that.\\
141 - Hi, I'm Jake's Uncle Charlie.\\
142 - Nicole.\\
143 - So what's the deal, Nicole?\\
144 - Are you tutoring our little genius here?\\
145 - No, we're dating.\\
146 - Oh. Dating?\\
147 - Uncle Charlie?\\
148 - Hang on.\\
149 - Listen, Nicole, I love this kid,\\
150 - and I don't want to see him get hurt.\\
151 - I'm not gonna hurt him.\\
152 - Oh, really? So you like him just the way he is?\\
153 - You don't want to change him at all?\\
154 - Uncle Charlie...\\
155 - I got your back here, buddy.\\
156 - 'Cause let me tell you something.\\
157 - This here is a lump of clay.\\
158 - And you know what it's gonna be five, ten, 20 years from now?\\
159 - A larger, more bitter lump of clay.\\
160 - Come on, let's go.\\
161 - Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
162 - I'm not done.\\
163 - So if you're gonna dump him, dump him now.\\
164 - Don't wait till he falls in love with you\\
165 - and asks you to marry him and have his children!\\
166 - Okay, enjoy yourselves!\\
167 - Are you out of your mind?\\
168 - I mean well.\\
169 - You think maybe it's time to go back to your shrink?\\
170 - Why? She's just another woman that wants to change me.\\
171 - Well, you have to do something.\\
172 - No, no.\\
173 - If I can't have Chelsea,\\
174 - I don't want to live.\\
175 - W-Where you going?\\
176 - Strip club.\\
177 - Ah, yes.\\
178 - Death by lap dance.\\
179 - * Men.\\
180 - Hey, Lord.\\
181 - It's Charlie.\\
182 - I know it seems like I only call on you when my ass is on fire,\\
183 - but, well, let's face it,\\
184 - that's how you made me.\\
185 - Anyway, I'm just hurting real bad since Chelsea left,\\
186 - and I was kind of hoping that maybe you could\\
187 - take away some of that pain.\\
188 - Even with the help of your blessed wine,\\
189 - I can't get through the day.\\
190 - Even your blessed vodka's stopped working.\\
191 - So, anything you can do would be much appreciated.\\
192 - WOMAN: Hey.\\
193 - You got a light?\\
194 - I like a little buzz before I pray.\\
195 - Gets me closer to God.\\
196 - (whispers): Thanks.\\
197 - * Men.\\
198 - * Men.\\
199 - Come on, Charlie, answer the phone.\\
200 - Ugh, damn it.\\
201 - Voice mail.\\
202 - Uh, Charlie, it's me again.\\
203 - It has been three days.\\
204 - Please call and let us know you're okay.\\
205 - I think we should call the police.\\
206 - Nah, he'll turn up.\\
207 - May be broke and riddled with gonorrhea,\\
208 - but he'll find his way home.\\
209 - No, I-I don't think this is a typical bender.\\
210 - He really cared for Chelsea.\\
211 - You know, he put her in his will.\\
212 - Anything happens to him, she gets everything.\\
213 - Really?\\
214 - So, like if he swam out in the ocean and drowned, for instance,\\
215 - she gets the house?\\
216 - The house, the Mercedes,\\
217 - the bank accounts, music royalties.\\
218 - Man, I just can't catch a break.\\
219 - Hey, look what someone threw away.\\
220 - Uh, put that back outside.\\
221 - And wash your hands.\\
222 - Welcome to your new home, baby.\\
223 - Hey, everybody.\\
224 - I want you to meet the love of my life,\\
225 - Mrs. Charlie Harper.\\
226 - Better put me down.\\
227 - I'm not wearing panties.\\
228 - I told you he'd come home with gonorrhea.\\
229 - All right, who's who?\\
230 - Well, this is my brother Alan.\\
231 - Alan, Betsy.\\
232 - Hello, brother.\\
233 - C-Call me Alan.\\
234 - Okay.\\
235 - He doesn't look like such a mooch.\\
236 - Okay, well, this is my mom Evelyn,\\
237 - and she doesn't look like such an Antichrist.\\
238 - Hi, Mom.\\
239 - (both chuckle)\\
240 - Call me Mrs. Harper.\\
241 - This is my housekeeper Berta.\\
242 - Don't call me at all.\\
243 - And lastly, this is Jake.\\
244 - (gasps)\\
245 - Oh, are you my son?!\\
246 - I'll be whatever you want me to be.\\
247 - Um, actually, he's my son.\\
248 - Butt out, Dad.\\
249 - Well, you've met everybody.\\
250 - Why don't we go upstairs and continue the honeymoon.\\
251 - (gasps) We have an upstairs?\\
252 - CHARLIE: Yep.\\
253 - Are there people up here, too?\\
254 - I like her.\\
255 - * Men.\\
256 - Hey, Dad. Mm-hmm?\\
257 - Do I call Uncle Charlie's new wife Betsy or Aunt Betsy?\\
258 - I guess either one's okay.\\
259 - I'm gonna go with Aunt Betsy.\\
260 - Fine.\\
261 - Aunt Betsy made a lot of noise last night.\\
262 - Uh, yeah, yeah, she did.\\
263 - Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining.\\
264 - Good morning, family.\\
265 - Morning. Morning.\\
266 - How we doing today?\\
267 - Good. Good.\\
268 - Will Aunt Betsy be joining us\\
269 - or is she taking a hot, soapy shower?\\
270 - She'll be right down.\\
271 - So, based on this latest turn of events,\\
272 - would it be fair to say you're over Chelsea?\\
273 - Oh, absolutely.\\
274 - Betsy and I are soul mates.\\
275 - Soul mates. Uh-huh.\\
276 - So, where'd you meet your soul mate?\\
277 - Guess.\\
278 - Strip club?\\
279 - Wrong.\\
280 - Massage parlor?\\
281 - Wrong.\\
282 - Okay, I give up.\\
283 - Betsy and I met in church.\\
284 - So what, she's a nun?\\
285 - No, she's a stripper and part-time masseuse.\\
286 - See, I drove to the strip club, but the parking lot was full\\
287 - so I circled the block looking for a spot\\
288 - and found one right in front of this little church.\\
289 - And for some reason-- I don't know why--\\
290 - I got out of my car,\\
291 - walked into the church and started praying.\\
292 - Are you saying God sent you Betsy?\\
293 - I think he did. Oh, Dad,\\
294 - we gotta get our asses to church.\\
295 - Then when I'm done, I get up to leave\\
296 - and she appears in front of me\\
297 - like some kind of vanilla-scented angel.\\
298 - Mmm, vanilla.\\
299 - So, we got to talking.\\
300 - Turns out she's going through a difficult time as well.\\
301 - Next thing I know,\\
302 - we're cleaning out her locker at the strip club\\
303 - and driving to Vegas.\\
304 - Where you got married.\\
305 - I understand your skepticism,\\
306 - but I'm telling you this girl is special.\\
307 - She's really sweet and spiritual.\\
308 - BETSY: Charlie?\\
309 - In here, baby.\\
310 - Good news, bad news.\\
311 - I got my period.\\
312 - Oh, that's okay.\\
313 - We can take a break.\\
314 - We don't have to.\\
315 - There's more than one way to skin a cat.\\
316 - Oh, you are so wonderful.\\
317 - What are the other ways?\\
318 - Shh! Uh...\\
319 - Charlie, uh, can I talk to you in private for a minute?\\
320 - Sure.\\
321 - Bets, coffee's right there.\\
322 - You just make yourself at home.\\
323 - Okay.\\
324 - Morning, son.\\
325 - Morning, Mom.\\
326 - So, I was gonna do a little topless sunbathing later.\\
327 - You're welcome to join me.\\
328 - Okay, not to put too fine a point on it,\\
329 - but you're out of your mind.\\
330 - You need to call a lawyer\\
331 - and get this marriage annulled immediately.\\
332 - I knew you wouldn't understand.\\
333 - Oh, I understand, I understand.\\
334 - You're still reeling from losing Chelsea\\
335 - and you're trying to fill the void\\
336 - with a menstruating pole dancer.\\
337 - Hey, hey, hey, that's my wife you're talking about.\\
338 - Oh, damn it, Charlie, you don't know anything about her.\\
339 - I know I love her and she loves me for exactly who I am.\\
340 - She doesn't want to change me.\\
341 - Oh, stop it.\\
342 - Okay, you get one of those.\\
343 - Next time, that hand comes back a bloody stump.\\
344 - Charlie, please, I'm begging you.\\
345 - No, I'm doing the right thing.\\
346 - You're lucky you're not a girl.\\
347 - Having a hoochie is like owning a vintage car.\\
348 - A lot of maintenance and once a month\\
349 - you gotta put down an oil pan.\\
350 - Okay, I may have made a mistake.\\
351 - * Men.\\
352 - Chelsea?\\
353 - Hey, Charlie.\\
354 - What are you doing here?\\
355 - I need to see your daughter.\\
356 - I'm sorry, she's not here.\\
357 - Hi, Charlie, what's going on? Ed.\\
358 - You know when she'll be back?\\
359 - I'm not sure.\\
360 - She just took Skipper for a walk.\\
361 - You're welcome to come in and wait.\\
362 - Thank you.\\
363 - What are you doing?\\
364 - I'm just trying to be polite.\\
365 - Did you ever consider that maybe she doesn't want to see him?\\
366 - Watch your tone, mister.\\
367 - Sit, please.\\
368 - Sorry the place is a mess, we're still decorating.\\
369 - I'm decorating, he's critiquing.\\
370 - What, I can have opinions.\\
371 - He wants me to just shut up and be pretty.\\
372 - So, listen,\\
373 - I'm sorry things didn't pan out with you and Chels.\\
374 - Me, too.\\
375 - Relationships can be a lot of work.\\
376 - Even if you've known someone for 40 years.\\
377 - That's right.\\
378 - People get set in their pigheaded ways.\\
379 - You want to get something off your chest, hmm,\\
380 - I'm right here.\\
381 - You really want to open this kettle of fish now?\\
382 - Oh, yeah, let's open it up, open it up.\\
383 - Okay.\\
384 - I'm just saying that two grown men should be able to pick out\\
385 - a club chair without it turning into Iwo freakin' Jima!\\
386 - Well, I'm not the one that thinks that everything\\
387 - he sits his ass on has to be made out of leather.\\
388 - Lucky for you!\\
389 - CHELSEA: Come on, Skipper.\\
390 - Charlie? I'm sorry to drop in like this.\\
391 - I just really needed to see you.\\
392 - Okay, what's going on?\\
393 - Uh, well...\\
394 - Uh, why don't we go in the other room\\
395 - and leave these two alone? Fine, fine.\\
396 - There's no law that says we can't order the area rug later\\
397 - and get two club chairs.\\
398 - You see, right there.\\
399 - That's why I love you.\\
400 - What are you doing here?\\
401 - Okay, well,\\
402 - I don't know how to say this\\
403 - except just to say it.\\
404 - I still love you very much, and I miss you like crazy.\\
405 - I miss you too, Charlie.\\
406 - Then what are we doing?\\
407 - Taking some time to figure out\\
408 - if we're meant to be together.\\
409 - And how the hell are we supposed to do that?\\
410 - I don't know.\\
411 - I guess we should start dating other people.\\
412 - What?!\\
413 - I'm not ready to see other people.\\
414 - I don't know that I am either, but I think we have to try.\\
415 - Chelsea, I can't even think about dating right now.\\
416 - Can I tell you something\\
417 - I've learned about myself since we split up?\\
418 - Sure, but first, marry me. No.\\
419 - Okay, just checking.\\
420 - Probably some legal complications, anyway.\\
421 - What? Nothing, nothing.\\
422 - Go ahead.\\
423 - I've learned that\\
424 - I shouldn't have tried to change you.\\
425 - What you need is someone who loves you for you.\\
426 - No, no, no, no, no, no. I need to be changed.\\
427 - There's something seriously wrong with me.\\
428 - Please, Chelsea, take me back and turn me into someone else.\\
429 - That wasn't a very good argument, was it?\\
430 - Nope.\\
431 - Well, that's the best I got.\\
432 - Okay, I guess I should get going.\\
433 - I'm really sorry.\\
434 - That's all right.\\
435 - Say good-bye to your dad and Ed for me.\\
436 - I will.\\
437 - They're a really cute couple.\\
438 - I guess.\\
439 - It's a little weird for me.\\
440 - Well sure, you're probably used to seeing your dad\\
441 - with your mom and not a big, handsome black guy.\\
442 - He is handsome.\\
443 - Hey, Chels...\\
444 - I just want you to know that if by chance you should\\
445 - do something crazy and stupid\\
446 - like running off and marrying some stranger,\\
447 - I would forgive you and take you back with open arms.\\
448 - Good to know.\\
449 - Seriously, I wouldn't hold it against you at all.\\
450 - Thank you.\\
451 - All right then.\\
452 - Good-bye.\\
453 - Bye.\\
454 - TOM (giggling): Stop it, Ed!\\
455 - Your beard tickles!\\
456 - Come on, Skipper, time for another walk.\\
457 - * Men.\\
458 - * Men.\\
459 - Uh, Charlie, we've got a little problem.\\
460 - What's up?\\
461 - This is Betsy's husband.\\
462 - Hello.\\
463 - Want to catch me up?\\
464 - Really?\\
465 - Calling him Betsy's husband didn't do the trick?\\
466 - I don't understand.\\
467 - She never said anything about being married.\\
468 - She never does.\\
469 - This has happened before?\\
470 - Oh, yes. Any time I find her wedding ring\\
471 - inside her empty diaphragm case,\\
472 - I know she's off on one of her little adventures.\\
473 - I don't believe this.\\
474 - Why do you put up with it?\\
475 - Hey, look at me.\\
476 - I'd rather share a girl like Betsy\\
477 - than have an exclusive relationship\\
478 - with a box of old porn magazines.\\
479 - I hear you.\\
480 - That would be sad.\\
481 - BETSY: Hey, baby.\\
482 - Hey. Hey.\\
483 - Charlie, I'm really sorry.\\
484 - I was less than honest with you.\\
485 - Sure, let's call it less than honest.\\
486 - I did enjoy our honeymoon.\\
487 - Me, too.\\
488 - We stayed at Bellagio.\\
489 - Nice!\\
490 - We should go.\\
491 - Bye. Bye.\\
492 - I'll make it up to you in the car.\\
493 - Oh, Betsy, I'm the luckiest guy in the world.\\
494 - How about that.\\
495 - I guess I'm not married.\\
496 - I guess not.\\
497 - You know what that means.\\
498 - Going back to church?\\
499 - That means I just got three days of unbelievable sex\\
500 - with no obligations and no commitment.\\
501 - Please don't make me slap you again.\\
502 - Nah, go ahead.\\
503 - I think I got one more coming.\\
504 - That's all right.\\
505 - I'm happy that things worked out for you.\\
506 - Again.\\
507 - Thanks.\\
508 - Oh, hey, did I tell you I won 18 grand in Vegas?\\
509 - (loud smacking) CHARLIE: Ouch!\\
510 - * Men.
\subsection {Episode 17: I Found Your Moustache}
1 - * Men...\\
2 - I'm gonna hate this movie.\\
3 - How can you be so sure?\\
4 - It's got subtitles.\\
5 - The only good subtitles are for Nazis,\\
6 - Colombian drug lords, and space aliens.\\
7 - Oh, and Kung Fu.\\
8 - Excuse me, but NPR called Hiroshima la Poubelle\\
9 - an "enchanting journey of self-discovery."\\
10 - Well, they're not gonna call it\\
11 - a "two-hour French snooze-fest for pompous douche-buckets."\\
12 - Hey, you agreed that if I paid for the tickets,\\
13 - we could see what I want to see.\\
14 - That's because I didn't actually think\\
15 - you could scrape together 18 bucks\\
16 - without stopping at a blood bank.\\
17 - Well, it is a small price to pay\\
18 - to finally get you out of the house.\\
19 - It's been three weeks since you and Chelsea broke up,\\
20 - and you need to move on.\\
21 - Says the guy who still carries around\\
22 - a naked picture of his ex-wife.\\
23 - Hey, I bought those boobs.\\
24 - I have a right to look at them once in a while.\\
25 - Damn. I don't believe it.\\
26 - What?\\
27 - She's here.\\
28 - My ex-wife?\\
29 - No! It's Chelsea.\\
30 - She's with that Brad guy.\\
31 - So wh-what do we do?\\
32 - Do we say hello?\\
33 - No. We get the hell out of here.\\
34 - CHELSEA: Charlie?\\
35 - Hey.\\
36 - Look who's here.\\
37 - Alan, Chelsea's here.\\
38 - Oh, hey, Chelsea.\\
39 - Hi, Alan.\\
40 - You guys remember Brad.\\
41 - How's it going?\\
42 - Good. Great.\\
43 - Looking forward to the movie.\\
44 - I'm surprised to see you here.\\
45 - This doesn't strike me as your cup of tea.\\
46 - Are you kidding? NPR called it\\
47 - an "enchanting journey of self-discovery."\\
48 - You know I live for that crap.\\
49 - Right.\\
50 - Okay, well, it was good seeing you.\\
51 - You, too.\\
52 - Wow.\\
53 - That was awkward.\\
54 - Tell me about it.\\
55 - Had to be tough for you.\\
56 - Your ex-fiance   out with another guy?\\
57 - Uh-huh.\\
58 - Good-looking guy.\\
59 - Yeah.\\
60 - You're here with your brother.\\
61 - I know.\\
62 - That'll tighten the old sphincter.\\
63 - Oh, God.\\
64 - You still want to go?\\
65 - No. No, I'm not gonna give her the satisfaction.\\
66 - I can suck it up for two hours.\\
67 - Three hours and 20 minutes.\\
68 - What?\\
69 - It covers four generations of transsexual Kabuki dancers.\\
70 - Let's go.\\
71 - All right, but I think\\
72 - you should pay me back for the tickets.\\
73 - Well, not now.\\
74 - When it's convenient.\\
75 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
76 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
77 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
78 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
79 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
80 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
81 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
82 - * Men...\\
83 - I can't believe she's already dating.\\
84 - You're kidding, right?\\
85 - The day after she moved out,\\
86 - you ran off to Vegas and married a stripper.\\
87 - People grieve in different ways, Alan.\\
88 - Mm.\\
89 - Besides, the stripper was already married,\\
90 - so no harm, no foul.\\
91 - (sighs) Everybody's got somebody but me.\\
92 - Hello? I'm not with anyone, either.\\
93 - Hello? You're a big loser that says "Hello?"\\
94 - I wonder if she's slept with him yet.\\
95 - Oh, don't go there, Charlie. Don't punish yourself.\\
96 - Well, if she hasn't already, I'll bet you she does tonight.\\
97 - Okay, punish yourself.\\
98 - I mean, what kind of man's gonna sit through\\
99 - a three-hour gay French flick unless he figures\\
100 - he's got a good shot at getting laid afterwards?\\
101 - You didn't even give that movie a chance.\\
102 - I'll bet you right now he's driving her back to his place.\\
103 - They're talking about the movie.\\
104 - He'll make up some crap about how it made him cry.\\
105 - Then he'll ask her in for a cup of coffee,\\
106 - which he'll turn into a glass of wine.\\
107 - One thing leads to another, and before you know it,\\
108 - he's got her in the bathtub running like a jet ski.\\
109 - At least that's how I'd play it.\\
110 - Come on.\\
111 - Where we going?\\
112 - Chelsea's. I got to see if she comes home tonight.\\
113 - Okay. Why am I going?\\
114 - Hello? I'm hammered.\\
115 - How's it gonna look if I get a DUI\\
116 - on the way to spy on my ex-girlfriend?\\
117 - He's very responsible about drinking and stalking.\\
118 - * Men...\\
119 - (sighs): How long are we gonna sit here?\\
120 - Till she comes home.\\
121 - What if she spends all night with Brad?\\
122 - Well, then we'll be here all night.\\
123 - (groaning sigh)\\
124 - No, no. No, don't...\\
125 - (groaning sigh)\\
126 - Hey, I can (groaning sigh) if I want to.\\
127 - I'm tired.\\
128 - Then go to sleep.\\
129 - Without my melatonin and mouth guard?\\
130 - I don't think so.\\
131 - Car, car, car.\\
132 - Oh, it's them.\\
133 - It's them. Get down. Get down. Okay.\\
134 - Quick, put this on.\\
135 - What the hell is it? Mustache.\\
136 - What are you doing with a mustache\\
137 - in your glove compartment?\\
138 - Don't worry. It's fake.\\
139 - That doesn't answer my question.\\
140 - You think you're the first guy who's ever checked up\\
141 - on a woman who's dumped you? Put it on!\\
142 - (sighs) There is a whole side to you\\
143 - I don't want to know anything about.\\
144 - Hey, that's a good look for you.\\
145 - It's kind of '70s porn star.\\
146 - I'm guessing.\\
147 - Look at that thing he's driving.\\
148 - What? It's a Prius. Of course it's a Prius.\\
149 - (mocking): I'm saving the planet.\\
150 - Could I play with your boobies?\\
151 - Hey, do not put down the green lifestyle.\\
152 - I have worked very hard\\
153 - to reduce the size of my carbon footprint.\\
154 - You're a mooch and a miser.\\
155 - Don't try to make it sound hip.\\
156 - All right, they're getting out of the car.\\
157 - Oh, don't you just love how he dresses?\\
158 - I mean, youthful, but not trying too hard.\\
159 - Unlike some people.\\
160 - Oh, great. They're kissing.\\
161 - Good thing he doesn't know where her mouth has been.\\
162 - Wait a minute.\\
163 - He's getting back in his car.\\
164 - And there he goes.\\
165 - Well, denied, Mr. Greenpeace Sissy Pants!\\
166 - There. You feel better?\\
167 - Can we please go home now?\\
168 - Wait, just a minute.\\
169 - I want to make sure she gets inside okay.\\
170 - You know, there's a soft side to you that I just applaud.\\
171 - You don't let it out very often,\\
172 - but when you do, it just lights up the world.\\
173 - Wait a minute.\\
174 - Why is she getting in her car?\\
175 - Where is she going at this hour?\\
176 - Maybe there's a third guy, and she's cheating on Brad.\\
177 - What?\\
178 - Isn't that how you'd play it?\\
179 - Follow her.\\
180 - * Men...\\
181 - CHARLIE: Catch up.\\
182 - Catch up. You're gonna lose her. Relax.\\
183 - This is not the first woman I've surreptitiously followed\\
184 - while honoring the letter of a restraining order.\\
185 - Oh. Looks like she's heading for Malibu.\\
186 - Who does she know in Malibu?\\
187 - No idea.\\
188 - (engine sputtering)\\
189 - What the hell is that? Oh, damn.\\
190 - I'm out of gas.\\
191 - How could you be out of gas? I don't know.\\
192 - I just put three dollars in the other day.\\
193 - Three dollars?\\
194 - Actually $2.50. I bought a Milky Way.\\
195 - Oh, crap!\\
196 - All right, we'll just have to call Triple-A.\\
197 - Um...\\
198 - You don't have Triple-A?\\
199 - It costs, like, $49 a year.\\
200 - Charlie, I gas up three dollars at a time!\\
201 - Great! Just great!\\
202 - Do you have Triple-A?\\
203 - I have Mercedes Gold Platinum Valet\\
204 - something or other.\\
205 - So? Won't they come and help us?\\
206 - Let's see.\\
207 - Will Mercedes come out to put gas in an '89 Volvo?\\
208 - I'll call them to ask.\\
209 - You're actually waiting for me to call, aren't you?\\
210 - No.\\
211 - (sighs) Come on.\\
212 - We'll just have to hoof it.\\
213 - What, I'm supposed to leave my car abandoned\\
214 - on the side of the road?\\
215 - What if somebody tries to steal it?\\
216 - Good thinking.\\
217 - Leave the keys, gas money, and a thank-you note.\\
218 - Spoken like someone with insurance!\\
219 - * Men...\\
220 - (sighs) (groans): Oh...\\
221 - My feet... are killing me.\\
222 - Well, that's what you get\\
223 - for wearing those expensive Italian loafers.\\
224 - They're just not made for walking.\\
225 - You're right.\\
226 - Hi, Charlie.\\
227 - Chels?\\
228 - Hey, Uncle Charlie,\\
229 - you look like a '70s porn star.\\
230 - I'm guessing.\\
231 - * Men...\\
232 - * Men...\\
233 - What are you doing here?\\
234 - I needed to talk to you.\\
235 - Okay. What's up?\\
236 - Um...\\
237 - Oh, uh, come on, Jake.\\
238 - Let's give them some privacy.\\
239 - Why? Do you think they're gonna do it on the couch?\\
240 - Okay, here it is.\\
241 - Seeing you tonight made me realize\\
242 - how much I miss you.\\
243 - Really?\\
244 - Do you miss me?\\
245 - Oh, yeah, he's been crying like a little girl.\\
246 - Will you go away!\\
247 - What? I'm on your side.\\
248 - Well, I can see nothing's changed around here.\\
249 - Well, just that you're gone.\\
250 - And-and yes, I do miss you,\\
251 - and I have been crying like a little girl.\\
252 - Good.\\
253 - So, what have you been up to?\\
254 - Not much. How do you like living\\
255 - with your dad and his boyfriend?\\
256 - It's a little weird.\\
257 - I can imagine.\\
258 - Two old Navy guys shacking up.\\
259 - The walls are pretty thin.\\
260 - Every night I'm hearing:\\
261 - (deep voice): "Up periscope, down periscope."\\
262 - "Launch the torpedo."\\
263 - Enough idle chitchat.\\
264 - What's the deal with you and Brad?\\
265 - He's great, but...\\
266 - it's just not the same.\\
267 - Have you two, uh...?\\
268 - No.\\
269 - Oh.\\
270 - (chuckles quietly)\\
271 - Wipe that smile off your face.\\
272 - You wipe it off.\\
273 - You're gonna have to do better than that.\\
274 - One question. Yeah?\\
275 - What was with the mustache?\\
276 - When I'm out with Alan,\\
277 - I don't like people to recognize me.\\
278 - Hey, they are doing it on the couch.\\
279 - * Men.\\
280 - So what's the deal with Uncle Charlie and Chelsea?\\
281 - Are they back together,\\
282 - or was that just a booty call?\\
283 - What do you know about booty calls?\\
284 - In theory, everything.\\
285 - Aw, crap.\\
286 - What?\\
287 - Just a little disappointed.\\
288 - I saw Chelsea's car outside. I didn't see yours.\\
289 - She spent the night,\\
290 - but we don't know if they're back together\\
291 - or if they were just scratching the old itch.\\
292 - What do you know about the old itch?\\
293 - It's intercourse, Dad.\\
294 - Why do we play these games?\\
295 - Good morning, all.\\
296 - Morning. Morning.\\
297 - What?\\
298 - Come on. Give.\\
299 - There's nothing to give.\\
300 - She came by, said she misses me, spent the night.\\
301 - Yay.\\
302 - So is she moving back in?\\
303 - Is the wedding back on?\\
304 - Or was it just making the beast with two backs?\\
305 - What is wrong with you?!\\
306 - I'm at an awkward age.\\
307 - Morning, everyone.\\
308 - Morning. Morning.\\
309 - Hey, you want coffee?\\
310 - Actually, I have to get home and change for work.\\
311 - Oh, okay. Can we talk?\\
312 - Sure.\\
313 - Oh, that's never good.\\
314 - How do you know?\\
315 - That's what Mom said to you.\\
316 - So I'm thinking, you grab some things\\
317 - from your dad's for tonight,\\
318 - and then we move all of your stuff back this weekend.\\
319 - Charlie, I'm not coming back tonight.\\
320 - Why not?\\
321 - Last night was good, right?\\
322 - It was great, but it doesn't solve our problems.\\
323 - Sure solved mine.\\
324 - It's not that I don't love you,\\
325 - but I'm still not sure that we have a future together.\\
326 - Chelsea, you're really freaking me out here.\\
327 - I've got to go.\\
328 - Come on. Wait.\\
329 - Oh, I found your mustache.\\
330 - Where was it?\\
331 - Where do you think it was? It was stuck to my ass.\\
332 - * Men.\\
333 - Hey.\\
334 - Hey.\\
335 - Feel like talking?\\
336 - No, I do not.\\
337 - Understandable.\\
338 - You got to admit you're in a better place now\\
339 - than you were this time last night.\\
340 - I mean, 24 hours ago,\\
341 - the woman you love was on a date with another man.\\
342 - But presto-change-o, she wound up\\
343 - spending the night with you.\\
344 - Of course, come the morning,\\
345 - once again, she dropped you like a lead turd.\\
346 - Sorry.\\
347 - You didn't want to talk.\\
348 - Me, I'm just the opposite.\\
349 - When I get my heart broken, I have to talk.\\
350 - You cannot shut me up.\\
351 - Yakkity-yak-yak-yak-yak.\\
352 - Sorry.\\
353 - I've tried to be the strong, silent type,\\
354 - but... it's just not who I am.\\
355 - I mean, not to mention there's physical manifestations\\
356 - to bottling up your feelings.\\
357 - I mean, constipation, migraines.\\
358 - Or it goes the other way: gas, diarrhea.\\
359 - You just cannot predict it.\\
360 - It's kind of an emotional crapshoot.\\
361 - (snickers)\\
362 - Crapshoot.\\
363 - That just came to me, right off the top of my head.\\
364 - (snorting laugh)\\
365 - Got it.\\
366 - But you are lucky.\\
367 - You've got your music to express your feelings.\\
368 - I mean, you could play the blues, for instance.\\
369 - (scatting blues riff)\\
370 - * My baby done left me\\
371 - (scatting blues riff)\\
372 - * She ain't coming back\\
373 - (scatting blues riff)\\
374 - What's going on?\\
375 - * I'm smothering your daddy.\\
376 - (scatting blues riff)\\
377 - * Men.\\
378 - (elevator bell dings)\\
379 - I'm just saying it seems like every time\\
380 - it's my turn to pick up the crap, he's got the runs.\\
381 - Well, stop feeding him chili.\\
382 - Oh, hey, Charlie. Hey, Charlie.\\
383 - Hey, Tom, Ed.\\
384 - Are you looking for Chelsea?\\
385 - No, he came to see two old queens\\
386 - walking a dog.\\
387 - Who are you calling a queen, Elizabeth?\\
388 - TOM: She's not here, Charlie.\\
389 - She went to dinner with that Brad guy.\\
390 - Oh.\\
391 - You want to come in, have a beer?\\
392 - Nah, I don't want to bother you guys.\\
393 - Don't be silly. Come on.\\
394 - Okay, thanks.\\
395 - You had to tell him she's with Brad?\\
396 - What, I'm supposed to lie?\\
397 - No, but you can dummy up.\\
398 - I mean, look at the poor bastard.\\
399 - I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.\\
400 - "I wasn't thinking."\\
401 - That should be your middle name.\\
402 - Don't be getting in my face when I'm holding a bag of poop.\\
403 - I'll grab some brews.\\
404 - Chelsea told me about last night.\\
405 - I don't understand it, Tom.\\
406 - I thought we were back together.\\
407 - Yeah, well, you can't make sense out of a woman.\\
408 - They're like beautiful puzzles with missing pieces,\\
409 - or a great book with no ending,\\
410 - or like my old man used to say,\\
411 - "They're all friggin' nuts."\\
412 - I don't know what to do.\\
413 - Should I leave her alone? Should I pursue her?\\
414 - If I might chime in.\\
415 - I would say that stopping by unannounced,\\
416 - with some liquor store flowers,\\
417 - sends up a rather desperate flare.\\
418 - I know, I know.\\
419 - I just couldn't sit home and do nothing.\\
420 - I keep turning it over in my mind.\\
421 - What did I do wrong?\\
422 - What could I have done differently?\\
423 - Man, how many times did I ask myself that question\\
424 - when I was married?\\
425 - Me, too.\\
426 - What have we got between the two of us--\\
427 - something like 80 years of marriage?\\
428 - Let's see-- I was with Beth for 38,\\
429 - and you were with Martha for 40, 41...\\
430 - I didn't need you to actually do the math.\\
431 - Don't bark at me.\\
432 - I'll beat the snot out of you.\\
433 - Bring it on, mister.\\
434 - Maybe I should go.\\
435 - No, no, no, sit down.\\
436 - Finish your beer.\\
437 - We're just sparring.\\
438 - I love this broken-down son of a bitch.\\
439 - Oh, for God's sake, don't gay it up\\
440 - in front of company.\\
441 - Now you listen to me, young man,\\
442 - in the final analysis,\\
443 - it doesn't matter what you did or didn't do.\\
444 - You want Chelsea back?\\
445 - You've got to make her miss you like you did last night.\\
446 - And she's not going to miss you\\
447 - if you're squatting in her living room\\
448 - with those sad-ass petunias.\\
449 - So, what, I'm supposed to just go about my business\\
450 - hoping that one day she shows up\\
451 - and says, "I'm back"?\\
452 - Or you can do like me and Ed did.\\
453 - Change teams.\\
454 - A lot easier living with a man than a woman.\\
455 - Tom and I watch the same TV shows.\\
456 - We like the same food.\\
457 - You don't have to leave the room to fart.\\
458 - You don't have to, but it sure would be a nice idea.\\
459 - Okay, well, thanks, fellas.\\
460 - This was real helpful.\\
461 - We're always here for you, Charlie.\\
462 - Thank you.\\
463 - And don't tell Chelsea I stopped by.\\
464 - I wouldn't dream of it.\\
465 - And remember what we told you:\\
466 - lay low for a while.\\
467 - Run silent, run deep.\\
468 - There you go.\\
469 - Well, what do you think?\\
470 - Watch Sports Center and then fool around a little?\\
471 - You, uh, you need to take a Viagra?\\
472 - You're my Viagra, baby.\\
473 - Ah, that's so sweet.\\
474 - Just for that, you can hold the remote.\\
475 - * Men.\\
476 - * Men.\\
477 - Hey.\\
478 - Sorry. Didn't mean to disturb you.\\
479 - Just grabbing a water.\\
480 - No, no, no, it's fine.\\
481 - Come on. Join me.\\
482 - Really?\\
483 - Yeah, sit down.\\
484 - Okay.\\
485 - (sighs)\\
486 - Listen, uh,\\
487 - I want to apologize for... you know...\\
488 - Trying to kill me with a pillow?\\
489 - It was horseplay.\\
490 - Don't make a big thing about it.\\
491 - What I'm saying is that I know you were trying to cheer me up,\\
492 - and I appreciate it.\\
493 - Thank you.\\
494 - I realize that I give you a hard time about living here,\\
495 - but frankly,\\
496 - it's probably a good thing to...\\
497 - have you around.\\
498 - Wow, Charlie.\\
499 - That means so much to hear you say that.\\
500 - Well...\\
501 - I do... I do love you, buddy.\\
502 - (voice breaking): And I love you, too.\\
503 - I know, I know.\\
504 - I don't want this moment to ever end.\\
505 - Okay.\\
506 - I mean it. I am not letting go.\\
507 - Well, you're gonna have to,\\
508 - 'cause it's starting to get a little weird.\\
509 - We don't need women.\\
510 - We've got each other.\\
511 - All right, you brought this on yourself.\\
512 - Don't worry. I'll wait for you on the other side.
\subsection {Episode 18: Ixnay on the Oggie Day}
1 - * Men.\\
2 - Yes, Judith, I did deduct $30\\
3 - from your child support check this month.\\
4 - Because I paid for Jake's haircut.\\
5 - Yes, it is usually nine dollars,\\
6 - but he wanted to go someplace without hobbyhorses.\\
7 - I know he's never gonna win any beauty contests,\\
8 - but he is our son.\\
9 - Look, I've got a patient. I got to go.\\
10 - Sorry you had to hear that.\\
11 - That's, uh, that's my ex-wife.\\
12 - Bee-yatch.\\
13 - Hello, Mrs. Honeycutt. I'm Dr. Harper.\\
14 - Doctor.\\
15 - Okay, so you are having spasms in your lower back?\\
16 - Yeah, it's awful.\\
17 - Some days I can't even get out of bed.\\
18 - Oh, I know how that is.\\
19 - You have back problems, too?\\
20 - No.\\
21 - Anyway, why don't you lie face down,\\
22 - and we'll see if we can locate the problem.\\
23 - I've tried everything.\\
24 - Acupuncture,\\
25 - yoga, shiatsu.\\
26 - Nothing seems to work.\\
27 - Not surprised.\\
28 - Those Eastern practices are mostly hooey.\\
29 - Modern chiropractic, on the other hand,\\
30 - is built on over 50 years of solid science.\\
31 - Okay, let's take a look at what we've got here.\\
32 - Okay, now is this too much pressure?\\
33 - No.\\
34 - Okay, how about this?\\
35 - No.\\
36 - Okay, now is this where the spasms occur?\\
37 - A little lower.\\
38 - Okay.\\
39 - Here?\\
40 - (moans) Lower.\\
41 - Here?\\
42 - (loud moan)\\
43 - Am I hurting you?\\
44 - No! God, no!\\
45 - (erotic moaning)\\
46 - Nobody's touched me like this since my husband died.\\
47 - Oh, um, I'm so sorry.\\
48 - Um, how long has it been since...?\\
49 - (loud moan) That long, huh?\\
50 - (loud moaning)\\
51 - Oh, my, it's, uh, pretty... pretty sensitive here.\\
52 - Harder!\\
53 - Oh, okay, no problem. Um...\\
54 - So, just out of curiosity, how did you find me?\\
55 - Uh, referral? Uh, my Web site?\\
56 - Or the fliers on the counter\\
57 - of the Mongolian barbecue across the street?\\
58 - Shut up and rub!\\
59 - Uh, I'm not technically rubbing.\\
60 - (loud moaning) ALAN: Whoa! Whoa, Nellie. Whoa!\\
61 - MRS. HONEYCUTT: Don't stop! I'm not stopping.\\
62 - Oh, spank me!\\
63 - ALAN: I'm-I'm sorry?\\
64 - MRS. HONEYCUTT: Spank my lonely ass!\\
65 - ALAN: What?! Do it, bitch!\\
66 - (slap) Yes, Doctor, harder!\\
67 - (loud slap) Yes!\\
68 - (slapping continues) Oh, God, yes!\\
69 - (slapping stops)\\
70 - Okay, let's take a look at the schedule.\\
71 - See what the, uh, rest of the afternoon looks like.\\
72 - Oh, that's not too bad.\\
73 - So, how are you liking your first day at work here?\\
74 - (door opening)\\
75 - Thank you, Dr. Harper.\\
76 - Uh, you are most welcome.\\
77 - A-And remember, alternating an ice pack with a heating pad\\
78 - is, uh, very helpful for spasming.\\
79 - I'd like to make another appointment.\\
80 - Oh, sure, sure. Uh...\\
81 - What were you thinking? Maybe next week, or...?\\
82 - Tonight.\\
83 - Uh, tonight?\\
84 - Oh, oh, gloriosky.\\
85 - Uh, uh... well, we, uh... we close up at 5:00, so...\\
86 - So I can expect you at my place at 9:00.\\
87 - Oh, gee. Uh, I-I don't do house calls.\\
88 - Per se.\\
89 - See you at 9:00.\\
90 - (door opens and closes)\\
91 - Uh, some patients pay in cash.\\
92 - Uh, uh, their insurance, uh, won't cover chiropractic.\\
93 - Uh, part of our ongoing health care crisis.\\
94 - Tragic, really.\\
95 - Uh, by the way, you are doing one heck of a job.\\
96 - In fact, here's a little something for you.\\
97 - Just 'cause your smile lights up the place.\\
98 - You know what? Let's sweeten the pot.\\
99 - Um, can you give me ten back?\\
100 - Not a problem.\\
101 - Can't put a price on a smile.\\
102 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
103 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
104 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
105 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
106 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
107 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
108 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
109 - * Men.\\
110 - I like the new look.\\
111 - Thanks.\\
112 - It's fashion forward.\\
113 - What does that mean?\\
114 - I don't know.\\
115 - It's what the guy who cut my hair said.\\
116 - He also said it was "fun and fabulous."\\
117 - Really?\\
118 - Yeah, and he invited Dad to a party.\\
119 - I didn't go.\\
120 - It's just nice to be asked.\\
121 - So, why'd you decide to abandon your classic cereal bowl coif?\\
122 - What's a "coif"?\\
123 - You can't glean it from the context?\\
124 - What's "glean"?\\
125 - Why'd you change your freakin' hair?\\
126 - My new girlfriend wanted me to.\\
127 - If your new girlfriend wanted you\\
128 - to jump off a bridge, would you do that?\\
129 - If she put her tongue in my mouth when she asked me, yeah.\\
130 - Well, I can't blame you.\\
131 - I once bought a woman a car for the same reason.\\
132 - She put her tongue in your mouth?\\
133 - Sure, let's say mouth.\\
134 - Can we get the check, please?\\
135 - Hey, why don't you let me get this one?\\
136 - Really? You're not going to go for the world record?\\
137 - What are you talking about?\\
138 - 1,647 meals in a row\\
139 - where you haven't taken out your stupid Velcro wallet.\\
140 - You were counting?\\
141 - Am I close?\\
142 - Nevertheless, I'm paying.\\
143 - (sniffs)\\
144 - You smell that, Jake?\\
145 - The air coming out of your father's wallet\\
146 - has been in there since before you were born.\\
147 - Very funny.\\
148 - Thank you.\\
149 - Wait, wait, wait.\\
150 - Nobody is going to believe this.\\
151 - For God's sake.\\
152 - Hey, isn't that Chelsea's friend, Gail?\\
153 - CHARLIE: Oh, yeah.\\
154 - I wonder if I should say hello.\\
155 - I wouldn't mind saying hello.\\
156 - Finish paying the check, you weasel.\\
157 - Hey, Dad, as long as you got your wallet out,\\
158 - I could use some new sneaks.\\
159 - Hmm. Oh...\\
160 - Sure.\\
161 - Are you dying?\\
162 - Charlie.\\
163 - Oh, hi, Gail.\\
164 - Great to see you.\\
165 - How've you been?\\
166 - Pretty good. You?\\
167 - Well, you know...\\
168 - Yeah, I'm sorry to hear about you and Chelsea.\\
169 - The way it goes.\\
170 - Win some, lose some.\\
171 - Start having liquor delivered straight to your house--\\
172 - you don't have to put on pants.\\
173 - Well, if it's any consolation, I know how you feel.\\
174 - I'm still not over my breakup.\\
175 - But I'm not much of a drinker, so...\\
176 - Cheers.\\
177 - Have you, uh... have you seen Chelsea?\\
178 - Yeah, actually I had dinner with her, and...\\
179 - We had dinner just the other night.\\
180 - Her and Brad?\\
181 - Yeah, come to think of it, he was there.\\
182 - Looks like they're an item now.\\
183 - I guess.\\
184 - You guess?\\
185 - What do you want from me, Charlie?\\
186 - They're in Mexico for the weekend.\\
187 - Mexico. Nice.\\
188 - I went there with her once.\\
189 - I'm sorry.\\
190 - No, no, no, no, it's fine.\\
191 - We had a great time.\\
192 - In fact, when we got back, I bought her a car.\\
193 - Yeah, she told me.\\
194 - Ooh...\\
195 - Listen, I got to go, but...\\
196 - if you ever want to talk.\\
197 - Oh, thank you.\\
198 - Bye. Bye-bye.\\
199 - For the last time, I am not dying and I'm not sick.\\
200 - Everything's fine.\\
201 - Okay, I got it.\\
202 - But you can understand my skepticism, right?\\
203 - * Men.\\
204 - I really don't see why I shouldn't ask her out.\\
205 - Seriously? The woman is Chelsea's best friend.\\
206 - So?\\
207 - She's single, I'm single. She's lonely, I'm lonely.\\
208 - She's gorgeous, I'm well above average.\\
209 - I'm just saying it's a bad idea.\\
210 - I never said it wasn't a bad idea.\\
211 - I said I don't know why I shouldn't do it.\\
212 - What's that?\\
213 - That's a portable massage table.\\
214 - So, what, you're givin' rub-and-tugs on the pier now?\\
215 - No.\\
216 - No, I am a licensed professional,\\
217 - and-and I will not stand here\\
218 - and be accused of unethical behavior.\\
219 - I mean, just because you have no moral compass\\
220 - doesn't mean I don't.\\
221 - And while, yes, that's a triple negative,\\
222 - it nevertheless defines me\\
223 - as the man for whom I am aiming to be!\\
224 - What the hell are you talking about?\\
225 - I am just trying to augment my income\\
226 - by seeing clients in their homes,\\
227 - thus alleviating them of the added stress of commuting,\\
228 - not to mention speed bumps and potholes, of which,\\
229 - as you know, can jostle the spine!\\
230 - Wow, guy picks up one $30 check and he has a brain aneurysm.\\
231 - * Men.\\
232 - (phone rings)\\
233 - (TV broadcast stops)\\
234 - Yeah?\\
235 - Chelsea?\\
236 - Hey! How are ya?\\
237 - Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, slow down, slow down.\\
238 - Why are you crying?\\
239 - Wait a minute.\\
240 - You're in Mexico?\\
241 - Why on Earth are you in Mexico?\\
242 - Oh, sure, Brad.\\
243 - Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry it's not working out.\\
244 - Well, I love you and I miss you, too.\\
245 - When are you gonna be back?\\
246 - Okay, okay, I'll-I'll see you tomorrow.\\
247 - I... can't wait.\\
248 - All right, bye-bye, sweetie.\\
249 - (chuckles ruefully)\\
250 - I hope that smile's for me.\\
251 - Uh, who else would it be for?\\
252 - * Men.\\
253 - * Men.\\
254 - You ready for round two?\\
255 - Well, um... yes and no.\\
256 - Something wrong?\\
257 - Yeah.\\
258 - While you were in the bathroom,\\
259 - uh, Chelsea called.\\
260 - Really?\\
261 - Apparently, things didn't go well in Mexico,\\
262 - and she's coming home.\\
263 - Well, that's a shame.\\
264 - Yeah.\\
265 - Anyway, she wants to see me.\\
266 - Said she loves me and misses me.\\
267 - So, one call and you're just gonna go running back?\\
268 - Um, yeah.\\
269 - Well... this is awkward.\\
270 - Come on. You know how I feel about her.\\
271 - I do.\\
272 - So, we should probably keep what happened tonight\\
273 - just between us, right?\\
274 - Mum's the word?\\
275 - Zip the lip?\\
276 - Ixnay on the oggie day aisle stay?\\
277 - Of course.\\
278 - You know, we could just pretend\\
279 - that you didn't get the phone call\\
280 - for, like, another hour.\\
281 - We could, couldn't we?\\
282 - But wouldn't that be... wrong?\\
283 - I won't tell if you don't.\\
284 - Uh, I'm sorry, Gail.\\
285 - I can't, I can't justify it to myself.\\
286 - Okay.\\
287 - Well, can I at least kiss you good night?\\
288 - Sure.\\
289 - On the other hand,\\
290 - there's no arguing with a boner.\\
291 - * Men.\\
292 - Let's see.\\
293 - When Gail came over,\\
294 - it was 11:00 here and midnight in Cabo.\\
295 - When Chelsea called,\\
296 - it was midnight here and 1:00 in Cabo.\\
297 - So when I did Gail at 12:10,\\
298 - Chelsea technically hadn't called yet.\\
299 - Not my best work, but I can live with it.\\
300 - Hey.\\
301 - Hey.\\
302 - Tough night, Bunky?\\
303 - I'm a whore, Charlie.\\
304 - Don't be so hard on yourself.\\
305 - Jake needed a haircut, and you had no money.\\
306 - What? No, no!\\
307 - I took money to give a woman pleasure.\\
308 - Wait a minute.\\
309 - You... gave a woman pleasure?\\
310 - Oh, you have no idea what powerful orgasms\\
311 - these hands are capable of delivering.\\
312 - No, no, no. I've always known that.\\
313 - I just find it hard to believe\\
314 - they could give them to other people.\\
315 - Yeah, well, maybe this'll convince you.\\
316 - A woman gave you this?\\
317 - Uh-huh, right before she told me\\
318 - she was done with me and I could show myself out.\\
319 - Sounds like a dream date to me.\\
320 - So what's the problem?\\
321 - How do I live with myself?\\
322 - How did you live with yourself before?\\
323 - By thinking I was better than you.\\
324 - Now after all these years, I've finally descended to your level.\\
325 - Oh, no-no-no, no, no.\\
326 - I may have done some questionable things in my life,\\
327 - but I have never taken money for it.\\
328 - That's not to say it wasn't offered.\\
329 - Deservedly so.\\
330 - Fine, I'm worse than you.\\
331 - That's all I'm saying.\\
332 - Well, I am going to take a shower\\
333 - and try to wash the cheapness off me.\\
334 - Better take some steel wool and a cheese grater.\\
335 - Hey, Alan.\\
336 - Oh, Gail...\\
337 - Hi.\\
338 - Don't judge me, Pretty Woman.\\
339 - Charlie, I better get going.\\
340 - Right, right.\\
341 - So, uh, you and I are okay?\\
342 - Yeah. I'm just sorry it has to end.\\
343 - Yeah, me, too.\\
344 - Chelsea's a lucky girl.\\
345 - You think so? You should tell her.\\
346 - I mean, don't tell her.\\
347 - Bye.\\
348 - Bye-bye.\\
349 - Thank you, Charlie.\\
350 - For what? (door closes)\\
351 - Proving once again that I am better than you.\\
352 - Hey, hey, I'm just a rascal!\\
353 - You are a male prostitute!\\
354 - That is a terribly hurtful thing to say.\\
355 - * Men.\\
356 - So there we are in this beautiful hotel room\\
357 - overlooking the ocean,\\
358 - and he's on the phone with his mother trying\\
359 - to help her download music to her iPod.\\
360 - You're kidding!\\
361 - And I just sat there thinking,\\
362 - "Charlie would never do this.\\
363 - Charlie hates his mother with a blind passion!"\\
364 - Remember when you used to think that was a bad thing?\\
365 - And when Brad's not on the phone with his mother,\\
366 - he's telling me how much I remind him of his mother.\\
367 - I hope not while you were in bed,\\
368 - 'cause that would reflect badly on everybody.\\
369 - You don't wanna know.\\
370 - There's nothing to know.\\
371 - You went to Mexico with another man,\\
372 - he talked about his mother in bed,\\
373 - and you didn't have sex with him.\\
374 - Charlie...\\
375 - Nope! That's what happened. End of story.\\
376 - (laughs)\\
377 - I should never have let you go.\\
378 - Well, sometimes you can't appreciate what you've got\\
379 - until you go to Mexico and don't have sex with a mama's boy.\\
380 - I'm sorry about Brad.\\
381 - I know that hurt you.\\
382 - Ah, it's water under the bridge.\\
383 - What you did, what I did, doesn't matter.\\
384 - What did you do?\\
385 - Doesn't matter.\\
386 - Charlie, no secrets.\\
387 - Please, can't I just have one?\\
388 - Whatever it is, it doesn't matter.\\
389 - We were separated.\\
390 - All right, here goes.\\
391 - I was having pizza with Alan and Jake the other day.\\
392 - By the way, Jake got a new haircut.\\
393 - It's just fabulous.\\
394 - Okay, well, you'll never guess who was there getting takeout.\\
395 - Your old buddy Gail.\\
396 - Oh, my God, you didn't.\\
397 - I didn't say I did, but good guess.\\
398 - I don't believe you!\\
399 - What?! We were separated.\\
400 - You were in Mexico with another man.\\
401 - But she's my best friend!\\
402 - Yeah, well, I'd have to say the jury's still out on that.\\
403 - You are such a pig!\\
404 - A-A-A pig who hates his mother.\\
405 - Go to hell!\\
406 - Oh, come on!\\
407 - It was 1:00 in Cabo!\\
408 - * Men.\\
409 - Oh! Lower.\\
410 - How about here?\\
411 - (low, loud moaning) Oh, yeah...\\
412 - that's how Mommy likes it.\\
413 - Okay, you know what?\\
414 - I'm sorry. I-I can't do this.\\
415 - What's wrong?\\
416 - I am a professional.\\
417 - I studied chiropractic\\
418 - for three years in Guadalajara.\\
419 - And that was with almost no Spanish language skills\\
420 - and a family of parasites living in my colon.\\
421 - And I did not go through all of that\\
422 - to become some sort of G-spot Johnny.\\
423 - Is that what you think you are?\\
424 - Well, you're giving me money, and I'm giving you...\\
425 - what I'm giving you.\\
426 - It just, it makes me feel cheap.\\
427 - So it's too much like a business transaction.\\
428 - Exactly.\\
429 - Well, how about we forget the money,\\
430 - and I'll show you something I learned in Guadalajara?\\
431 - What?\\
432 - ALAN: * Ai, yi, yi, yi!\\
433 - * Canta y no llores...\\
434 - * Men.\\
435 - (doorbell rings)\\
436 - Oh, hey, hi.\\
437 - I'm sorry.\\
438 - I overreacted.\\
439 - Yeah, you kinda did.\\
440 - You're both single, you're both adults,\\
441 - and you and I were separated.\\
442 - Plus you were honest with me, so I'm willing to put it behind us.\\
443 - Oh, thank you. Thank you!\\
444 - I love you so much.\\
445 - I love you, too.\\
446 - Why don't I take you out\\
447 - for a nice lunch and we'll catch up?\\
448 - You wanna go out?\\
449 - I'm a little hungry.\\
450 - Aren't you a little hungry?\\
451 - Gail's upstairs, isn't she?\\
452 - Once again, we were separated and I was vulnerable!\\
453 - Just so we're on the same page,\\
454 - are we still together or am I allowed to go back upstairs?!\\
455 - Oh, damn!\\
456 - (sighs)\\
457 - Oh, how much madder could she get?\\
458 - * Men.\\
459 - with the back spasms.\\
460 - Thank you, Doctor. I'll see you on Wednesday.\\
461 - Looking forward to it.\\
462 - Uh, and Mrs. Honeycutt? Yes?\\
463 - (lowers voice): Uh, if it's okay with you,\\
464 - I think I'd like to go back to our original arrangement.\\
465 - But you said it made you feel cheap.\\
466 - What can I say? Turns out I am cheap.\\
467 - Your call. Bye-bye.\\
468 - Bye.\\
469 - Have I told you lately that you are doin' a great job?\\
470 - (chuckling nervously)\\
471 - 'Cause you are doin' a great job!\\
472 - (chuckling nervously)\\
473 - In fact, I am going to make you employee of the month.\\
474 - I want an adjustment.\\
475 - Uh, I'm sorry.\\
476 - Are-Are you having back problems?\\
477 - No, I want an adjustment like you give her.\\
478 - Oh, gee, I-I don't think that would be appropriate.\\
479 - All right, then I want a raise and dental insurance.\\
480 - Hop on the table.\\
481 - * Men.

1 - * Larry was just a single dad\\
2 - * Till a toxic spill in the science lab *\\
3 - * Gave him super strength and X-ray eyes *\\
4 - * He cooks, he cleans, and now he flies *\\
5 - * Superdad\\
6 - * He's a Superdad\\
7 - * He's a whiz in the kitchen *\\
8 - * Makes potatoes au gratin...\\
9 - * While helping the government find Osama bin Laden. *\\
10 - Oh, hey.\\
11 - What's that?\\
12 - I'm writing a theme song\\
13 - for a new sitcom on Nickelodeon.\\
14 - Does the show suck as much as the song?\\
15 - Who the hell are you?\\
16 - Oh, this is my friend, Eldridge.\\
17 - He plays drums.\\
18 - Okay.\\
19 - That explains the bad attitude.\\
20 - What, you're ragging on my name?\\
21 - No, I'm ragging on your instrument.\\
22 - Now, beat it. I'm busy.\\
23 - (chuckles) He said "beat it."\\
24 - And "instrument."\\
25 - * Fighting crime, packing lunches *\\
26 - * Changing diapers and throwing punches... *\\
27 - Little turd was right.\\
28 - This does suck.\\
29 - Hey.\\
30 - Hey.\\
31 - Jake's friend show up?\\
32 - Yeah, he's here.\\
33 - When's he leaving?\\
34 - I said he could spend the night.\\
35 - Really? Did you consider clearing it with me?\\
36 - You would have said no to Jake having a friend over?\\
37 - If you recall, seven years ago, I said no to having Jake over.\\
38 - And yet, here he is, so what's the point in asking?\\
39 - Fine.\\
40 - What do we know about the little drummer boy?\\
41 - Not much. Jakes says he's one of the cool kids at school.\\
42 - Then, why is he hanging out with Jake?\\
43 - Are you saying my son's not cool?\\
44 - I'm saying your son got his tongue stuck\\
45 - to the freezer last weekend.\\
46 - That could have happened to anybody.\\
47 - Anybody who tried to pick up an Eskimo Pie with their tongue.\\
48 - His hands were full.\\
49 - With a HoneyBaked Ham.\\
50 - Okay, so he's not cool.\\
51 - And he eats a lot of crap.\\
52 - And his grades aren't the best.\\
53 - And his personal hygiene is a little sketchy.\\
54 - Is there a "but" coming?\\
55 - But he's my son,\\
56 - and I love him.\\
57 - (chuckles)\\
58 - What's so funny?\\
59 - Mom says the same thing about you.\\
60 - Really? Mom says she loves me?\\
61 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
62 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
63 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
64 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
65 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
66 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\

71 - * Superdad\\
72 - * He's a Supe...\\
73 - (electronic drums playing)\\
74 - Stupid drummers.\\
75 - (playing rock power chords)\\
76 - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,\\
77 - hey, hey!\\
78 - Hey.\\
79 - I'm trying to work out there.\\
80 - Well, what do you think we're doing in here, man?\\
81 - Don't feed me straight lines, Alfalfa.\\
82 - Just keep it down.\\
83 - Alfalfa?\\
84 - He gives everyone nicknames.\\
85 - I'm Pumpkin Head.\\
86 - My dad's the Sponge.\\
87 - Don't even ask what he calls my grandma.\\
88 - It rhymes with "bitch."\\
89 - Oh, wait, it is Bitch.\\
90 - Rhymes with, uh...\\
91 - Ditch?\\
92 - No.\\
93 - Snitch?\\
94 - No.\\
95 - Itch? No.\\
96 - Man, this is boring.\\
97 - Hold on. I'll think of it.\\
98 - No, I mean, what are we going to do tonight?\\
99 - I don't know. What do you want to do?\\
100 - I don't know.\\
101 - Well, I don't know, either.\\
102 - Hey.\\
103 - Why don't we steal some beer from your fridge,\\
104 - go down to the beach and get wasted.\\
105 - Okay, but I got to warn you,\\
106 - I get kind of stupid when I drink.\\
107 - Don't worry. You can leave the thinking to me.\\
108 - Hey, you know what?\\
109 - It does rhyme with "ditch."\\
110 - What does?\\
111 - * Men.\\
112 - BOY (over TV): Daddy, is Mr. Boots dead?\\
113 - MAN: Well, Jay Bob, you did throw him out of a moving car.\\
114 - That's never good for a housecat.\\
115 - (audience laughing)\\
116 - JAY BOB: I thought they were supposed to land on their feet.\\
117 - MAN: And that's what he was trying to do\\
118 - when he bounced off the FedEx truck.\\
119 - But let me see what I can do.\\
120 - Cover your eyes. JAY BOB: Okay.\\
121 - (high-pitched whirring)\\
122 - (cat meows)\\
123 - JAY BOB: Mr. Boots, you're okay!\\
124 - MAN: Just remember, he's only got five lives left.\\
125 - (laughter)\\
126 - Maybe my song doesn't suck enough.\\
127 - Hey.\\
128 - So, where's Jake and Eldridge?\\
129 - Beats me.\\
130 - Last I saw them, they were stealing beer\\
131 - out of the fridge and sneaking out the back.\\
132 - They stole beer?\\
133 - They had to. I locked up the hard stuff.\\
134 - Charlie!\\
135 - Relax. How drunk can they get off a 12-pack?\\
136 - (sighs)\\
137 - Damn it.\\
138 - This had to be Eldridge's idea.\\
139 - Jake would never think of it on his own.\\
140 - That's true.\\
141 - Last bright idea he had\\
142 - was to pick up an Eskimo Pie with his tongue.\\
143 - I better go look for them.\\
144 - Good idea.\\
145 - Embarrass him in front of his only guy friend.\\
146 - Eldridge isn't his only guy friend.\\
147 - Who else does he hang out with?\\
148 - And you can't count you, me, or military recruiters.\\
149 - So, what, I'm supposed to do nothing?\\
150 - They have to be punished.\\
151 - Don't worry. The alcohol will punish them plenty.\\
152 - Yeah, that's really worked for you.\\
153 - Trust me, Alan: inside, I'm suffering.\\
154 - Oh, the agony.\\
155 - * Men.\\
156 - (retching)\\
157 - Beer's not so cool now, is it?\\
158 - Leave me alone.\\
159 - And you--\\
160 - what is your mother going to say?\\
161 - (retching)\\
162 - For God's sake, that's wicker!\\
163 - (chuckling): Hey.\\
164 - How are we all doing in here?\\
165 - (Jake and Eldridge retching)\\
166 - You should have stopped them when you had the chance.\\
167 - And miss out on this?\\
168 - How's it hanging, Alfalfa?\\
169 - (retching)\\
170 - And you call yourself a drummer.\\
171 - Keith Moon is vomiting in his grave.\\
172 - * Men.\\
173 - (playing romantic melody)\\
174 - That's really beautiful, Charlie.\\
175 - Thanks.\\
176 - I wrote it before I got kicked out of Juilliard.\\
177 - I got to ask:\\
178 - how'd you go from writing something like that\\
179 - to jingles and kid music?\\
180 - Well, after I left school,\\
181 - I came back to L.A. hoping to write film scores.\\
182 - But I met this advertising guy\\
183 - who needed a song about toothpaste.\\
184 - Before I knew it, I was rhyming\\
185 - "exhilaration" with "constipation."\\
186 - "Open doors" with "cold sores."\\
187 - And one I am particularly proud of,\\
188 - "make a switch" with "feminine itch."\\
189 - I hear you.\\
190 - When I came out here, I was hoping to be a dancer.\\
191 - (stops playing) Really?\\
192 - Yeah.\\
193 - Then I met pot and doughnuts.\\
194 - Before I knew it, I was scrubbing toilets\\
195 - and hosing teenage barf out of wicker baskets.\\
196 - Rhyme that, Beethoven.\\
197 - * A tisket, a tasket\\
198 - * I'm barfing in a basket.\\
199 - That's what pays your salary, baby.\\
200 - (doorbell ringing)\\
201 - All right, this is Eldridge's mom.\\
202 - I'm going to give her a piece of my mind.\\
203 - Oh, just let it go.\\
204 - No, no. This is poor parenting on her part,\\
205 - and she needs to know about it.\\
206 - Hi. I'm here to pick up Eldridge.\\
207 - I hope he wasn't too much trouble.\\
208 - Trouble?\\
209 - He was an angel. Come on in.\\
210 - * Superdad.\\
211 - * Men.\\
212 - * Men.\\
213 - Thank you so much, Alan.\\
214 - Well, hey, Eldridge is welcome anytime.\\
215 - We single parents have to stick together.\\
216 - Yeah. See you, buddy.\\
217 - Yeah, bite me.\\
218 - I heard that, young man.\\
219 - Good for you. Get in the car.\\
220 - Can I drive? Not with a suspended license, you can't.\\
221 - You suck! And you're ruining my life!\\
222 - Okay, bye-bye.\\
223 - Yes?\\
224 - What happened to giving her a piece of your mind?\\
225 - Oh, come on. We both know what happened.\\
226 - Right.\\
227 - Piece of tail always trumps piece of mind, doesn't it?\\
228 - What do you want from me?\\
229 - She's a beautiful woman.\\
230 - She's been through a tough divorce.\\
231 - She raising a teenage son by herself.\\
232 - Last thing she needs\\
233 - is me dumping more problems in her lap.\\
234 - So, what are your plans for her lap?\\
235 - I don't know. I... I might call her.\\
236 - We'll see.\\
237 - You're unbelievable.\\
238 - Your son finally gets a friend,\\
239 - and you're going to try to nail his mother?\\
240 - All right, okay, first of all,\\
241 - with a classy woman like Lyndsey, there's no nailing.\\
242 - There's, uh... there's dating and bonding\\
243 - and-and getting to know one another.\\
244 - And then, you know, eventually consummating the relationship\\
245 - with mutual respect and caring.\\
246 - Oh, grow up.\\
247 - This is a hot divorced mom from the Valley.\\
248 - You're going to need three penises\\
249 - and a set of jumper cables just to get her attention.\\
250 - Oh, you're disgusting.\\
251 - Hey, I'm not the one trying\\
252 - to bang the drummer's mom slowly.\\
253 - Don't you judge me.\\
254 - Why not?\\
255 - You've slept with one of Jake's teachers,\\
256 - his den mother, his karate instructor,\\
257 - his ballet teacher, and his aunt.\\
258 - Great. So five wrongs make a right.\\
259 - What?\\
260 - If I jump off a bridge and land on top of some broad Jake knows,\\
261 - that makes it okay for you to do it, too?\\
262 - What?\\
263 - I think I've made my point.\\
264 - What?\\
265 - * Men.\\
266 - I'm never gonna drink again.\\
267 - Quitter.\\
268 - Charlie?\\
269 - Oh, right.\\
270 - Atta boy.\\
271 - Here's your wastebasket.\\
272 - I rinsed it out,\\
273 - but there are still some tiny chunks in the weave.\\
274 - Maybe you could use your dad's Waterpik.\\
275 - Give the kid a break, Berta.\\
276 - He's hung over.\\
277 - Oh, the poor dear.\\
278 - Next time, tell your friends to puke out the window.\\
279 - Want to know a surefire hangover cure?\\
280 - Never stop drinking.\\
281 - Charlie?\\
282 - Let me finish.\\
283 - Or never start in the first place.\\
284 - See how I turned that around?\\
285 - Bring it home, Dr. Cosby.\\
286 - All right, for starters,\\
287 - you and Eldridge stole beer that did not belong to you.\\
288 - That is not how I raised you.\\
289 - Now to the issue of underage drinking.\\
290 - Not only is it against the law, alcohol destroys brain cells.\\
291 - Alan, Alan,\\
292 - you gotta tailor the pitch to the audience.\\
293 - What do you mean?\\
294 - Forget brain cells.\\
295 - Jake, listen to me. This is very important.\\
296 - Alcohol can make it tough to get a boner.\\
297 - You're kidding.\\
298 - I can't tell you how many times I've said,\\
299 - "This has never happened before."\\
300 - Huh.\\
301 - Where are you going?\\
302 - To check out your theory.\\
303 - Remember: he's your son, and you love him.\\
304 - * Up, up, and away in my...\\
305 - Dr. Alan Harper. May I help you?...\\
306 - Oh, oh, hi, Lyndsey.\\
307 - No, no, you're not interrupting.\\
308 - Just doin' some stomach crunches.\\
309 - Hang on.\\
310 - And... a thousand.\\
311 - So what's up?\\
312 - Uh, tonight?\\
313 - Sure, sure, I'd love to.\\
314 - Yeah, yeah, I know that place.\\
315 - 8:00? Perfect.\\
316 - See you then.\\
317 - (chuckles) How about that?\\
318 - She called me. Wants to have drinks.\\
319 - Nice. What are you gonna tell Jake?\\
320 - Who?\\
321 - I mean, what do you mean?\\
322 - I mean, are you gonna tell him\\
323 - you're hookin' up with his buddy's mom?\\
324 - Okay, first of all, nobody said anything about hooking up.\\
325 - It's just drinks.\\
326 - And-and second of all, Jake went out and had drinks last night\\
327 - and didn't tell me.\\
328 - Man, that's the most lame-ass rationalization\\
329 - for questionable behavior I've ever heard from you.\\
330 - Yeah, so?\\
331 - Kudos.\\
332 - Hey, Uncle Charlie? You were wrong.\\
333 - * Men.\\
334 - It is so nice to get out of the house\\
335 - and spend time with another grownup.\\
336 - I know.\\
337 - It's hard to be a single parent.\\
338 - Thankless, really.\\
339 - Oh, tell me about it.\\
340 - Dealing with the ex.\\
341 - Setting boundaries.\\
342 - The loneliness.\\
343 - The frustration.\\
344 - It's all worth it though.\\
345 - Oh, yeah.\\
346 - My son is the greatest gift of my life.\\
347 - Mine, too.\\
348 - I can't imagine loving anything more than I love Jake.\\
349 - To our children.\\
350 - Our children.\\
351 - (gasping) Tell me I'm a good mom!\\
352 - Oh, you're a good mom!\\
353 - I'm a dirty mom!\\
354 - Oh, you're so dirty!\\
355 - (toilet flushes)\\
356 - Uh, whoopsie!\\
357 - Automatic flusher.\\
358 - (gasping): Do, do that again!\\
359 - Okay.\\
360 - (toilet flushes)\\
361 - Not the toilet!\\
362 - Sorry! Sorry!\\
363 - * Men.\\
364 - (plays short arpeggio)\\
365 - Hey!\\
366 - Hey-hey-hey-hey- hey-hey!\\
367 - Aren't you grounded?\\
368 - Um, I think that's just when my dad's here.\\
369 - Get in the house...\\
370 - all of you.\\
371 - I thought you were cool.\\
372 - No, you didn't.\\
373 - How old are you?\\
374 - Sixteen.\\
375 - What about you? Same.\\
376 - That's what I thought.\\
377 - We were just goin' down to the beach.\\
378 - Nobody asked you.\\
379 - I want you to listen to this\\
380 - and tell me if it makes you wanna watch the TV show.\\
381 - (plays rollicking melody)\\
382 - * Larry was just a single dad\\
383 - * Till a toxic spill in the science lab *\\
384 - * Gave him super strength and X-ray eyes *\\
385 - * He cooks, he cleans, and now he flies *\\
386 - * Superdad!\\
387 - * He's a super-bad, fightin' mad *\\
388 - * College grad, wearin' plaid Superdad! *\\
389 - (plays glissando flourish)\\
390 - BOTH: Oh, my God, that's great!\\
391 - Absolutely fantastic. Yeah, I would so watch that.\\
392 - You wrote that?\\
393 - You think?\\
394 - BOTH: Yeah, definitely. Yeah.\\
395 - Oh, yeah, really makes you wanna see the show.\\
396 - Thanks. Thank you.\\
397 - All right, well, I guess you guys all wanna get going.\\
398 - Yeah. Yeah, let's go. Yeah.\\
399 - Psst, Jake.\\
400 - Yeah?\\
401 - If you've got a choice, take the tall one.\\
402 - Why?\\
403 - Trust me.\\
404 - It's my superpower.\\
405 - Thanks.\\
406 - (plays chord)\\
407 - Super uncle!\\
408 - * Men.\\
409 - * Men.\\
410 - (audience cheering over TV)\\
411 - I'm back.\\
412 - Oh, good. I was starting to worry.\\
413 - How'd it go with Jake?\\
414 - Hardly knew he was here.\\
415 - Can you keep a secret?\\
416 - The real question is "Can I remember a secret?"\\
417 - You were right.\\
418 - That's no secret.\\
419 - I-I mean about Lyndsey.\\
420 - Who's Lyndsey?\\
421 - Eldridge's mom.\\
422 - Who's Eldridge?\\
423 - Jake's friend.\\
424 - The drummer?\\
425 - Anyway, we did wind up having sex.\\
426 - You and me?\\
427 - You really need to get into a program.\\
428 - It's not funny anymore.\\
429 - Humor is very subjective.\\
430 - Come on. Be serious.\\
431 - I'm just telling you about Lyndsey\\
432 - because I may need you to cover for me with Jake.\\
433 - Don't worry. I got your back.\\
434 - Thanks, Charlie.\\
435 - Good night.\\
436 - Good night.\\
437 - Is he gone?\\
438 - Who?\\
439 - Dad.\\
440 - Oh. Yeah.\\
441 - Thanks.\\
442 - Don't worry. I got your back.\\

1 - * Men. *\\
2 - (chuckles)\\
3 - I can't believe this is only our second date.\\
4 - I know, I feel like I've known you all my life.\\
5 - Me, too.\\
6 - I'm assuming you mean that as a good thing.\\
7 - Absolutely.\\
8 - (both moan)\\
9 - You're such an unexpected surprise in my life, Alan.\\
10 - Oh, thank you.\\
11 - Uh, once again, I'm assuming that's good.\\
12 - (laughs)\\
13 - It's great.\\
14 - (both moaning)\\
15 - Do you always wear your socks in bed?\\
16 - Oh, oh, no, it's just one of my toenails is kind of snaggly\\
17 - and I didn't want to scratch you with it.\\
18 - Oh, okay.\\
19 - Had I known we were going to make love,\\
20 - I would have slapped a corn pad on the little bugger.\\
21 - (chuckles)\\
22 - (door opens)\\
23 - BOY: Mom! Damn it.\\
24 - Eldridge, why aren't you with your dad?!\\
25 - 'Cause he's a giant douche!\\
26 - Don't talk about your father that way!\\
27 - He's actually a colossal douche.\\
28 - Um, uh, should I go?\\
29 - No, no, it's fine.\\
30 - (moans)\\
31 - Do we have anything to eat?!\\
32 - Order a pizza!\\
33 - I've got company!\\
34 - Is it Dave?!\\
35 - No! Jimmy?\\
36 - No!\\
37 - He's just trying to push my buttons.\\
38 - Yeah, Jake's exactly the same way,\\
39 - always trying to get my goat.\\
40 - Now, who are Dave and Jimmy?\\
41 - Shh, shh, shh.\\
42 - ELDRIDGE: Please don't tell me\\
43 - you're doing Jake's loser dad!\\
44 - I'm a divorced mother with a 16-year-old son!\\
45 - I can't be picky!\\
46 - Now, shut your pie hole!\\
47 - I hate you! I hate you right back!\\
48 - (door slams)\\
49 - So... where were we?\\
50 - Um... are you sure you don't want\\
51 - to spend some time with your son?\\
52 - I just did.\\
53 - Fair enough.\\
54 - Can you tell I got my boobs done?\\
55 - Oh, no. They, uh, they feel very natural.\\
56 - Oh, good.\\
57 - That kid absolutely ruined the first set.\\
58 - Same thing happened to my ex-wife.\\
59 - By the time Jake got through with them,\\
60 - they looked like a couple of windsocks on a quiet day. Yeah.\\
61 - Oh, just, uh, just FYI,\\
62 - I'm all original equipment. Ah.\\
63 - Aside from, you know, a little anal bleaching.\\
64 - What?\\
65 - Oh, it was an accident.\\
66 - I, uh, sat on a Clorox bottle by mistake.\\
67 - Story for another day.\\
68 - (music blasts from radio)\\
69 - Eldridge, turn down the freakin' music!\\
70 - Yeah, well, I don't want to hear you have sex!\\
71 - Then put on your headphones!\\
72 - That's why I bought them for you!\\
73 - (music stops)\\
74 - That's better.\\
75 - Come here.\\
76 - Is something wrong?\\
77 - Oh, no, no. Everything's great.\\
78 - Are you sure, 'cause...\\
79 - your toenail's the only thing poking me right now.\\
80 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
81 - I'm a little distracted.\\
82 - Well, let me undistract you.\\
83 - (electronic drums playing)\\
84 - Son of a bitch.\\
85 - What the hell is wrong with you?!\\
86 - Hang in there.\\
87 - We've practiced for this.\\

95 - (playing melancholy version of "Chelsea Morning")\\
96 - * Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning *\\
97 - * And the first thing that I heard *\\
98 - * Was a song outside my window\\
99 - * And the traffic wrote the words... *\\
100 - Oh, give it a rest.\\
101 - I miss Chelsea.\\
102 - Hey. I miss the '80s,\\
103 - but you don't see me snorting blow off a DeLorean.\\
104 - I know he's grounded, Judith,\\
105 - but why can't he be grounded at your house?\\
106 - Well, I have a life, too.\\
107 - Yes, I do.\\
108 - Since now.\\
109 - Okay, I'll tell you the truth.\\
110 - I... I've got a new girlfriend\\
111 - and she only gets off one night a week and...\\
112 - Why is that funny?\\
113 - Oh! Ha, ha.\\
114 - That's the pot calling the kettle non-orgasmic,\\
115 - don't you think?\\
116 - Hello?\\
117 - Hello? (groans)\\
118 - Well, have a nice day, you miserable bitch!\\
119 - Oh, oh, you're still here!\\
120 - Uh, uh, have a good weekend.\\
121 - You know, Zippy, you remind me of a blind cat I used to have.\\
122 - Bumping into walls,\\
123 - stepping into his water dish.\\
124 - He was a hoot.\\
125 - I called him "Magoo."\\
126 - Cute.\\
127 - No, he was ugly, too.\\
128 - Oh, hey, Charlie, uh, you gonna be home tonight?\\
129 - Why?\\
130 - No. Come on.\\
131 - I've got a romantic night planned, but I need somebody\\
132 - to keep an eye on Jake 'cause he's grounded.\\
133 - I got a better idea.\\
134 - Open the front door and leave a trail of hamburgers\\
135 - to the Army recruiting office.\\
136 - Everybody wins but America.\\
137 - Hey, uh, Berta, would you do me a favor?\\
138 - Oh, Magoo, always walking into walls.\\
139 - * Men. *\\
140 - (floorboard creaks)\\
141 - (engine starts)\\
142 - (garage door closing)\\
143 - (garage door closing)\\
144 - (rapping on window)\\
145 - (screams)\\
146 - Where are you going?\\
147 - I told you. I've got a date.\\
148 - And I told you I'm not going to be responsible for your kid.\\
149 - Oh, you don't have to be responsible for him,\\
150 - just let him see you.\\
151 - You know, the illusion of adult supervision.\\
152 - No, no, no. I've got plans of my own.\\
153 - So if you're going to go, take your kid with you.\\
154 - Please, Charlie, I booked a beautiful hotel room.\\
155 - And I put it on a credit card, so there's no refund.\\
156 - What do you mean "a credit card"?\\
157 - I'll pay you back, I swear.\\
158 - Come on, it's just for one night!\\
159 - I don't ask for much.\\
160 - Don't ask for much? You're a human tip jar.\\
161 - I'm begging you.\\
162 - I already took the Cialis.\\
163 - Please don't make me stay home with a boner.\\
164 - You were going to make me stay home with a boner!\\
165 - Okay, okay, think about this.\\
166 - If it works out with me and Lyndsey,\\
167 - I might be able to move out of your house and into hers.\\
168 - Don't do that, Alan.\\
169 - Don't toy with my heart.\\
170 - All right, all right, tell you what.\\
171 - Go tell Jake to pack a bag.\\
172 - I'll drop him off at his mom's.\\
173 - Now, you're making sense.\\
174 - (tires screeching)\\
175 - Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!\\
176 - This isn't over!\\
177 - Sorry!\\
178 - All right, here's the deal.\\
179 - I've got someone coming over tonight,\\
180 - so I need you to make yourself scarce.\\
181 - Are you back with Chelsea?\\
182 - No, I'm not back with Chelsea.\\
183 - So what's this new girl's name?\\
184 - I don't know-- Jasmine, Jade.\\
185 - I asked for Asian.\\
186 - Who'd you ask?\\
187 - Nobody.\\
188 - Just get out of here for the night.\\
189 - But I'm grounded. Hey, hey!\\
190 - Hey, hey, hey.\\
191 - I don't burden you with my problems.\\
192 - Hey, Eldridge. My uncle's horny.\\
193 - I'll meet you at the pier.\\
194 - * Men. *\\
195 - This is fun, huh?\\
196 - Sneaking off to a hotel room\\
197 - like a couple of horny teenagers. Mm-hmm.\\
198 - Of course, I never had enough money\\
199 - as a teenager to afford a hotel room.\\
200 - My first time was on a miniature golf course.\\
201 - Inside the windmill.\\
202 - No kidding. Did you get a hole in one?\\
203 - Uh, well actually a hole in two.\\
204 - I lost the first one taking the putter out of the bag.\\
205 - (laughing)\\
206 - So, uh, where was your first time?\\
207 - Backstage at a Police concert.\\
208 - Oh, Sting?\\
209 - Little bit.\\
210 - (laughing)\\
211 - Can we stop at the drug store?\\
212 - Oh, uh, don't worry.\\
213 - I brought enough condoms to golf our brains out.\\
214 - No, actually, I have to get some tampons.\\
215 - Oh. Oh, you mean for just in case, right?\\
216 - 'Fraid not. Sorry.\\
217 - Oh, no, no. Don't, don't be silly.\\
218 - Um, this is more about us\\
219 - spending quality time together than anything else.\\
220 - I'm glad you feel that way.\\
221 - Nevertheless, I do have a plan "B."\\
222 - Oh, what's that?\\
223 - Plan "B," Alan.\\
224 - It goes with my plan "J."\\
225 - Oh...\\
226 - Yay!\\
227 - * Men. *\\
228 - * Men. *\\
229 - ANNOUNCER (on TV): The conference said it has been informed by the NCAA...\\
230 - WOMAN: So, Charlie,\\
231 - how can I make you happy?\\
232 - What are my choices?\\
233 - Well, you paid for\\
234 - the full girlfriend experience, so...\\
235 - anything you want.\\
236 - Anything I want. Mm-hmm.\\
237 - I like that.\\
238 - Okay...\\
239 - Read this magazine...\\
240 - ...while I watch SportsCenter.\\
241 - I want the girlfriend experience\\
242 - and that's what my girlfriend used to do.\\
243 - Okay.\\
244 - And every once in a while,\\
245 - look at me and sigh while rolling your eyes.\\
246 - (sighs)\\
247 - Oh, baby, that's what Daddy likes.\\
248 - * Men. *\\
249 - (Lyndsey moaning)\\
250 - Cramps, huh?\\
251 - LYNDSEY: No, I'm having another child.\\
252 - (laughs)\\
253 - Uh, you know, not that I'm complaining,\\
254 - but don't you gals usually circle\\
255 - this time of the month on the old calendar?\\
256 - It's not an exact science, Alan.\\
257 - Aw, for God's sake.\\
258 - It's like the horse head scene in The Godfather.\\
259 - Could be worse.\\
260 - Could be the prom scene from Carrie.\\
261 - That's not funny.\\
262 - Sorry. Tell you what.\\
263 - I will, uh, call for some room service.\\
264 - Any special requests? Maybe some champagne?\\
265 - Sure, whatever.\\
266 - Oh, your wish is my command.\\
267 - (louder): Uh, hello. Hi.\\
268 - Yeah, this is Dr. Alan Harper.\\
269 - I'm in room 710,\\
270 - and I would like a bottle of your best champagne.\\
271 - Oh, really?\\
272 - You don't have anything more expensive?\\
273 - All right, it'll have to do.\\
274 - Also, I would like some fresh strawberries\\
275 - and a dozen blue point oysters.\\
276 - Well, find some.\\
277 - This is a special evening and I will spare no expense.\\
278 - Thank you.\\
279 - LYNDSEY: Hey, Alan?\\
280 - Yes, my sweet?\\
281 - Can you hand me my purse?\\
282 - Oh, sure.\\
283 - Incoming.\\
284 - Ow!\\
285 - Sorry.\\
286 - We're in luck.\\
287 - We are?\\
288 - I've still got a couple of Vicodin I stole from my son.\\
289 - You stole drugs from your son?\\
290 - It's only fair. He stole my youth.\\
291 - All righty.\\
292 - Room service.\\
293 - Oh, that was quick.\\
294 - * Men. *\\
295 - (TV chatter)\\
296 - All right, now, we've circled back around\\
297 - to hockey scores, so... (TV turns off)\\
298 - time for sex.\\
299 - Okay.\\
300 - And what kind of sex does Charlie want?\\
301 - Ooh...\\
302 - Hard to pick.\\
303 - It's kind of like Baskin-Robbins.\\
304 - You know, if they charged $1,000 a scoop.\\
305 - And sprinkles are way extra.\\
306 - Well, I guess if I have to choose,\\
307 - my favorite kind of sex is make-up sex.\\
308 - You're kidding.\\
309 - No, it's great.\\
310 - Here's how we do it.\\
311 - I will do or say something that will really irritate you.\\
312 - I can imagine that happening.\\
313 - And then we'll have an argument,\\
314 - which will escalate into a fight.\\
315 - You'll sulk, I'll pout.\\
316 - Then after a couple of minutes, we'll look at each other\\
317 - and realize we're being silly, and how lucky we are to have each other.\\
318 - Then I will take you in my arms\\
319 - and we'll hump our brains out.\\
320 - Fine. How do we start?\\
321 - Let me think.\\
322 - All right.\\
323 - Go in the bathroom and look in the sink.\\
324 - What?\\
325 - Just-just do it. Trust me.\\
326 - Oh, God, it's disgusting!\\
327 - Good, go with that.\\
328 - Would it kill you to rinse out the sink after you shave?\\
329 - Sorry.\\
330 - All right, I forgive you.\\
331 - No, no-no, no, no, no, no. Not yet.\\
332 - Make me work for it.\\
333 - Okay.\\
334 - Damn it, Charlie,\\
335 - you're the most thoughtless man in the world.\\
336 - Oh, come on, I'll rinse out the sink when I brush my teeth.\\
337 - You haven't brushed your teeth yet?\\
338 - What kind of a pig are you?\\
339 - Nice touch.\\
340 - But just remember, you're not really mad about the whiskers.\\
341 - You're mad, 'cause I don't listen to you\\
342 - and I don't like your friends\\
343 - and I said snide things about your mother.\\
344 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, so...\\
345 - when do we get to the "humping our brains out"?\\
346 - Oh, we're not even close.\\
347 - This goes on for hours.\\
348 - Take this and pretend like you're working.\\
349 - Oh, sweetie, I don't have to pretend.\\
350 - How would you feel about slapping some\\
351 - greasy skin cream all over your face?\\
352 - Where you going with this?\\
353 - I'm just talking skin cream.\\
354 - What do you think, I'm some kind of freak?\\
355 - Okay, but I'm not that kind of freak.\\
356 - * Men. *\\
357 - (music from TV)\\
358 - (belches)\\
359 - Whoa, that's going to attract seagulls.\\
360 - Okay, let's get this over with.\\
361 - Don't you want to have some room service champagne and oysters?\\
362 - No. I do this better on an empty stomach.\\
363 - (TV turns off)\\
364 - By the way, um, I'm a little foggy from the Vicodin,\\
365 - so if I fall asleep in the middle,\\
366 - just give me a little tap on the shoulder.\\
367 - Okay.\\
368 - Come here.\\
369 - You're a good kisser, Alan.\\
370 - Thank you.\\
371 - Better than my ex-husband.\\
372 - Oh. Well, good for me.\\
373 - He made up for it\\
374 - below the waist, if you know what I mean.\\
375 - He had big feet?\\
376 - Three of them.\\
377 - But only two wore shoes.\\
378 - Lucky you.\\
379 - Ah, don't worry.\\
380 - Size doesn't matter to me.\\
381 - Good to know.\\
382 - In fact, in this situation,\\
383 - the smaller the better.\\
384 - Um... you're welcome?\\
385 - (gurgling)\\
386 - What the hell was that?\\
387 - Um, I don't know.\\
388 - (gurgling) Uh-oh.\\
389 - What?\\
390 - I think the oysters are making a break for it.\\
391 - Excuse me.\\
392 - Are you going to throw up?\\
393 - I wish!\\
394 - You might want to turn the TV on-- loud!\\
395 - Why?\\
396 - You don't want to hear what's about to happen!\\
397 - * Oh... klahoma\\
398 - * Where the wind comes sweeping down the plain *\\
399 - * Where the waving wheat\\
400 - * It sure smells sweet when the wind... *\\
401 - * Men. *\\
402 - All right, one grilled cheese\\
403 - with avocado and bacon, extra crispy.\\
404 - Oh, thank you, honey.\\
405 - You realize that bacon's going to kill you.\\
406 - I know.\\
407 - You say you know, but you keep eating it.\\
408 - Oh, come on, don't nag.\\
409 - I'm not nagging, I'm concerned about you.\\
410 - Fine, fine. I'll take the bacon off.\\
411 - Don't do me any favors.\\
412 - No-no, no. I'm doing it. I'm doing it, see?\\
413 - (door opens and closes)\\
414 - Who's that?\\
415 - Just the kid. Jake, get in here!\\
416 - We have a kid?\\
417 - You didn't say anything about having a kid.\\
418 - He's not ours. He's my brother's.\\
419 - So what's my part in this scenario?\\
420 - You don't think I'm a good role model, and yet, paradoxically,\\
421 - you still want to have children with me.\\
422 - What?\\
423 - Did you go out even though you were grounded?\\
424 - You told me to.\\
425 - Don't look at me like that. He's lying.\\
426 - I'm not lying.\\
427 - And I'm not looking at you.\\
428 - All right, all right, enough.\\
429 - You, young man,\\
430 - go to your room and think about what you've done.\\
431 - Whatever.\\
432 - I think we handled that really well.\\
433 - Tough love, but I'm still the cool uncle.\\
434 - Hey, if you're happy, I'm happy.\\
435 - I'm very happy.\\
436 - In fact, are you free tomorrow?\\
437 - I'm never free, but I'm available.\\
438 - Well, great.\\
439 - How about you drag me to some boring museum\\
440 - so I can miss the Laker game?\\
441 - It's your money.\\
442 - Is it okay if I go take a shower?\\
443 - Well, sure. Okay.\\
444 - I'll be up in a bit.\\
445 - (sighs)\\
446 - Still cheaper than getting married.\\
447 - * Men. *\\
448 - All righty. Here we are.\\
449 - Thank you. You're welcome.\\
450 - Believe it or not, I actually had a good time.\\
451 - Really? Well, yeah.\\
452 - Nice hotel, room service, no teenagers.\\
453 - Um, I'm glad.\\
454 - So, shall we try it again\\
455 - in, you know, five or six days?\\
456 - I would like that.\\
457 - Okay, uh...\\
458 - I don't mean to rush you, but I really\\
459 - have to go home to my bathroom.\\
460 - Want to use mine?\\
461 - Uh, no. No, that wouldn't\\
462 - be good for our relationship.\\
463 - All right.\\
464 - Well, bye.\\
465 - Seriously, get out of the car.\\
466 - * Oh... klahoma where the wind comes... *

1 - * Men.\\
2 - WOMAN (on TV): Bill, did you notice that girl\\
3 - in the bikini coming down the slope?\\
4 - MAN (on TV): I did...\\
5 - You might want to eat something\\
6 - so that when you throw up later,\\
7 - it won't just be alcohol and stomach juice.\\
8 - Way ahead of you.\\
9 - I call it an Egg McBourbon.\\
10 - So this is your life now?\\
11 - You just sit here miserable and alone,\\
12 - waiting for Chelsea to call?\\
13 - I'm not waiting for her to call.\\
14 - I'm watching TV. Hmm.\\
15 - And occasionally, I cry.\\
16 - You do realize you're watching the Weather Channel?\\
17 - WOMAN (on TV): All the way to the South East...\\
18 - (dramatic instrumental music plays on TV)\\
19 - Happy?\\
20 - Oh, yeah, The Pet Channel.\\
21 - Who doesn't enjoy seeing a dog get his anal glands expressed?\\
22 - (phone ringing)\\
23 - Chelsea?\\
24 - (sighs)\\
25 - Your ex-wife.\\
26 - Oh.\\
27 - Speaking of having one's anal glands expressed.\\
28 - Hi, Judith. What's up?\\
29 - Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.\\
30 - That's terrible.\\
31 - Oh. Her grandfather died.\\
32 - He was 94. It's no big deal.\\
33 - (clears throat)\\
34 - Well, he's in a better place now.\\
35 - He has to be.\\
36 - He lived in Sacramento.\\
37 - I'm sorry. What's that?\\
38 - You're kidding.\\
39 - Oh. Oh, I-I...\\
40 - I always loved that clock.\\
41 - He left me his grandfather clock.\\
42 - Very old, worth a fortune.\\
43 - I can sell it and buy a new car.\\
44 - Oh, Judith, that's just tragic.\\
45 - So, uh, when are they going to deliver the clock?\\
46 - Oh. Yeah, yeah.\\
47 - I guess your grandmother does have more important things\\
48 - to box up now...\\
49 - like your grandfather.\\
50 - You're right, not funny.\\
51 - She never got my sense of humor.\\
52 - Uh, well, I guess I'll just drive up\\
53 - to Sacramento and pick it up.\\
54 - Uh, once again, my deepest sympathies.\\
55 - Okay.\\
56 - Score!\\
57 - Help me out here.\\
58 - Why would Judith's grandfather leave you a valuable antique?\\
59 - He liked me. I was the only one in the family\\
60 - who would sit for hours listening\\
61 - to his stupid stories about Korea.\\
62 - He fought in Korea?\\
63 - No, he was a sex tourist.\\
64 - Very creepy.\\
65 - You know, I always admired that clock.\\
66 - I remember the first time I saw it, I said,\\
67 - "Bill, that is a hell of a clock you got there."\\
68 - Uh, and he was hard of hearing,\\
69 - so that led to the Korea stories.\\
70 - Oh, hey,\\
71 - you want to drive up and get it with me?\\
72 - Let's see.\\
73 - Do I want to drive six hours to Sacramento\\
74 - to pick up a dead guy's clock?\\
75 - With me.\\
76 - Don't take this the wrong way,\\
77 - but I would rather get a maple syrup enema\\
78 - and then sit on an anthill.\\
79 - You didn't just make that up.\\
80 - No. No, I've actually compiled a list of things I'd rather do\\
81 - than spend long periods of time with you in an enclosed space.\\
82 - Want to hear some more?\\
83 - No, thank you.\\
84 - You sure? 'Cause I got a beauty\\
85 - that involves hemorrhoids, a bottle brush and sea salt.\\
86 - I get it.\\
87 - I'll just take Jake.\\
88 - Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.\\
89 - So both you and Jake are gonna be gone? Yes.\\
90 - Score!\\
91 - * Men.\\
92 - MAN (on TV): Here's ordinary cat litter\\
93 - after five days of continuous use\\
94 - by a relatively healthy cat.\\
95 - Yuck! Looks bad, smells worse.\\
96 - Now, here's Magic Pussy Litter\\
97 - with its patented Cluster Busters...\\
98 - That is really cool.\\
99 - Hey.\\
100 - Hey.\\
101 - What you watching?\\
102 - An amazing breakthrough in cat crap technology.\\
103 - Dad says you're vegging in front of the TV\\
104 - 'cause you still miss Chelsea.\\
105 - Well, he's right for a change.\\
106 - You know, I kind of do, too.\\
107 - Remember how she would come down in the morning,\\
108 - and lean over to pour cereal for breakfast,\\
109 - and you could see right down her robe?\\
110 - Too soon?\\
111 - What are you doing up so late?\\
112 - I was hungry.\\
113 - Want to join me for a grilled cheese sandwich?\\
114 - Nah. Pigs in a blanket?\\
115 - I'm all right.\\
116 - Two ice cream sandwiches on a waffle?\\
117 - I'll pass.\\
118 - It's no trouble,\\
119 - I'm making 'em anyway.\\
120 - I'm fine.\\
121 - You know, I really am sorry about you and Chelsea.\\
122 - Well, thanks, buddy.\\
123 - Her boobs are real, right?\\
124 - Yup.\\

136 - Relax, take in the scenery.\\
137 - Okay, now what?\\
138 - I don't know.\\
139 - Um... we enjoy each other's company.\\
140 - All right.\\
141 - Okay, now what?\\
142 - Oh, come on.\\
143 - This is a golden opportunity to get to know each other\\
144 - as more than just father and son.\\
145 - What else are we?\\
146 - We're two men on the open road, free and unencumbered.\\
147 - Oh.\\
148 - What's unencumbered?\\
149 - Uh, no restraints.\\
150 - We can do whatever we want.\\
151 - Okay.\\
152 - I want to drive.\\
153 - Later. Pick something else.\\
154 - (passes wind squeakily)\\
155 - Oh! (laughs)\\
156 - Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho! Yeah.\\
157 - Oh!\\
158 - Oh, well, very funny.\\
159 - Uh, so you want to go toot for toot? Well, check this out.\\
160 - (passes wind)\\
161 - (laughs) Wow.\\
162 - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\\
163 - That is a bran muffin and a half a grapefruit, my friend.\\
164 - Yeah, well, this is grilled cheese sandwich,\\
165 - pigs in a blanket and a waffle ice cream sandwich.\\
166 - (passes wind)\\
167 - Oh! Oh! Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?\\
168 - Well, this is an antidepressant\\
169 - and a mochaccino.\\
170 - (passes wind)\\
171 - Uh-oh.\\
172 - Keep an eye out for a gas station.\\
173 - * Men.\\
174 - 28, 29, 30.\\
175 - Aw, hell, she ain't gonna miss one.\\
176 - Hey, Russell.\\
177 - Oh, hey, Charlie.\\
178 - You want a muscle relaxer?\\
179 - You take one with a Viagra,\\
180 - and you're essentially Gumby with a Pokey.\\
181 - (laughs)\\
182 - No, thanks.\\
183 - I actually have a prescription from a doctor.\\
184 - Whoa. Look at you\\
185 - following the letter and spirit of the law.\\
186 - Sleeping pills.\\
187 - Those can be fun.\\
188 - You know, with a couple Red Bulls\\
189 - so you don't fall asleep.\\
190 - Party is over, Russell.\\
191 - I need to get some sleep.\\
192 - Oh. Well, then you don't want this.\\
193 - Nope.\\
194 - You want something organic,\\
195 - something created by Mother Nature.\\
196 - What do you got in mind? Ganja.\\
197 - You trying to sell me pot?\\
198 - Ah, not just pot.\\
199 - I call this Ojai So-high.\\
200 - Two hits, and a couple of chicken burritos,\\
201 - and it's "Goodnight, Irene."\\
202 - Don't you need a prescription for that?\\
203 - What are you, a cop?\\
204 - Okay, okay, but you're just driving the price up.\\
205 - Hello.\\
206 - Oh, Dr. Gollygupta.\\
207 - Russell here.\\
208 - Oh, hello, Russell.\\
209 - How are they hanging?\\
210 - Twice the length of my penis, thanks for asking.\\
211 - My friend here needs a prescription.\\
212 - All right, uh, let me see him.\\
213 - Oh, okay.\\
214 - Charlie, I'd like you to meet Dr. Gollygupta\\
215 - of the Gollygupta Hypertension and Glaucoma Clinic\\
216 - in Sri Lanka.\\
217 - Please to turn your head and cough.\\
218 - Just turn your head... Yeah. (coughs)\\
219 - (coughs) There you go.\\
220 - Oh, that's no good.\\
221 - I'll send you a prescription.\\
222 - (phone ringing)\\
223 - Excuse me.\\
224 - Hello, DirecTV customer service.\\
225 - Roger speaking.\\
226 - (printer beeps)\\
227 - Oh, here it is.\\
228 - Ah. Great news, Charlie.\\
229 - You've got glaucoma!\\
230 - * Men.\\
231 - You know, for gas station sweatpants,\\
232 - these aren't bad.\\
233 - I beg to differ.\\
234 - May I say that you have become a very good driver?\\
235 - Grand Theft Auto, Dad.\\
236 - It'd like driver's ed, but with pimps and hos.\\
237 - Well, whatever.\\
238 - So, uh, have you given any more thought\\
239 - to what you want to do after high school?\\
240 - If this is the college talk,\\
241 - I think we need to both be realistic.\\
242 - Hey, hey, I know\\
243 - a big university is probably out of reach for the time being,\\
244 - but there's still junior colleges,\\
245 - community colleges, trade schools.\\
246 - Hmm, man, I'd like to trade schools right now\\
247 - 'cause this one's kicking my ass.\\
248 - Come on, Jake.\\
249 - You know what I'm talking about.\\
250 - You have to start making plans.\\
251 - Did you have plans when you were my age?\\
252 - Yeah, I had big plans.\\
253 - What happened to 'em?\\
254 - Just drive.\\
255 - My life isn't over, you know.\\
256 - Okay.\\
257 - What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.\\
258 - Well, then, you must be like The Hulk.\\
259 - Let me tell you something, young man.\\
260 - Chapter two of your father's story has yet to be written.\\
261 - Is chapter one "I Crapped My Pants"?\\
262 - * Men.\\
263 - Is that what I think it is?\\
264 - Yeah. I got a prescription.\\
265 - God, I love California.\\
266 - Just walk into a store and buy your weed.\\
267 - No more schlepping out to Reseda\\
268 - and trading a piece of tail\\
269 - for a short bag of stems and seeds.\\
270 - You're welcome to join me here.\\
271 - No, no, not while I'm working.\\
272 - All right.\\
273 - Okay, I'm done working.\\
274 - Man...\\
275 - if I'd known you liked the wacky weed,\\
276 - I wouldn't have spent the last eight years\\
277 - getting baked under the deck.\\
278 - You know, when I was on break.\\
279 - Actually, this is the first time I've touched the stuff\\
280 - since a ZZ Top concert in '92.\\
281 - I got so paranoid, I locked myself in a Porta Potti\\
282 - and tried to tunnel home.\\
283 - (laughs)\\
284 - Well, good news.\\
285 - Pot's a lot stronger now.\\
286 - What do you think?\\
287 - I've rolled better joints on the back of a motorcycle\\
288 - while digging a bullet out of my boyfriend's shoulder.\\
289 - All right, fine.\\
290 - You try it.\\
291 - Oh, man, I hope this helps me sleep.\\
292 - I can't take another night,\\
293 - wandering around the house, thinking about Chelsea.\\
294 - Yeah, yeah, boo-hoo.\\
295 - Let's fire up this bad boy.\\
296 - * Men. *\\
297 - This is stupid.\\
298 - We should've just left it in the car.\\
299 - Well, it's very valuable, Jake.\\
300 - I don't want to see it stolen.\\
301 - Who steals clocks?\\
302 - Clocktomaniacs.\\
303 - You have your mother's sense of humor.\\
304 - Okay, let's put her down real easy.\\
305 - Okay.\\
306 - O-kay.\\
307 - Good.\\
308 - So, it looks like we have a couple of hours\\
309 - of daylight left.\\
310 - How about you and I get to know our state capital?\\
311 - You want to drive to San Francisco?\\
312 - No, Sacramento is the capital of California.\\
313 - I don't think so.\\
314 - Trust me.\\
315 - Come on, got a map from the lobby\\
316 - that shows all the places of interest in Old Sac.\\
317 - (chuckles) Old sac. Get it?\\
318 - Oh, yeah.\\
319 - That was much better than my joke.\\
320 - JAKE: Look at us, a couple of nuts\\
321 - hanging out in Sacramento.\\
322 - * Men. *\\
323 - * Men. *\\
324 - (both laughing)\\
325 - Do it again.\\
326 - Do it again. No, no. Oh, come on, please.\\
327 - Do it again. Do it again.\\
328 - All right, all right. Last time. All right.\\
329 - (   la federale): Badges?\\
330 - We don't need no stinkin' badges!\\
331 - Okay, okay, I got one.\\
332 - I got one.\\
333 - (   la Karl from Sling Blade) Mm.\\
334 - Some folks call it a sling blade.\\
335 - I call it a kaiser blade.\\
336 - Mm. (laughing)\\
337 - I like them French fried taters.\\
338 - Mmm.\\
339 - Oh, good idea.\\
340 - Where you going?\\
341 - To the pier to get some of them French fried taters.\\
342 - No. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
343 - What?\\
344 - I love you, Berta.\\
345 - I love you, too, Charlie.\\
346 - Give me a thousand dollars.\\
347 - Why?\\
348 - Well, if you have to ask, you don't really love me.\\
349 - Oh, oh, and-and pretzels!\\
350 - Get some pretzels! Pretzels?\\
351 - We don't need no stinkin' pretzels!\\
352 - (chuckles)\\
353 - Oh, man, I'm so lucky to have her in my life.\\
354 - You've had a lot of wonderful women in your life.\\
355 - But you always find a way to sabotage the relationship.\\
356 - Chelsea?\\
357 - MIA: She's right, Charlie.\\
358 - If there's a way it can be blown, you'll blow it.\\
359 - And not in the fun way.\\
360 - Mia?\\
361 - Tell me something, Charlie.\\
362 - Do you think your inability to commit\\
363 - and all your macho posturing\\
364 - is because deep down, you're afraid you're gay?\\
365 - You know,\\
366 - I've wondered that, too.\\
367 - Are you just a big ol' 'mo?\\
368 - LYDIA: He's not a 'mo.\\
369 - He's got mommy issues.\\
370 - Lots and lots of mommy issues.\\
371 - Lydia!\\
372 - Hey, it's Lydia.\\
373 - EVELYN: Excuse me.\\
374 - Why does everyone blame the mother?\\
375 - Frankly, I think you were more on target\\
376 - with that homo theory.\\
377 - Okay, I don't want to be high anymore!\\
378 - *\\
379 - * Men. *\\
380 - Hey, ask me why they should change the name\\
381 - of the Sacramento Kings to the Sacramento Nads?\\
382 - Why?\\
383 - That way, everyone can chant, "Go Nads!\\
384 - Go Nads!"\\
385 - Another winner.\\
386 - Yeah, I may not be good at school or sports,\\
387 - but no one beats me at ball jokes.\\
388 - I'm so proud.\\
389 - Can we watch TV?\\
390 - You can watch TV anytime.\\
391 - Let's talk.\\
392 - You sure?\\
393 - That hardly ever goes well.\\
394 - Come on, what's going on in your life?\\
395 - Nothing.\\
396 - Oh, please, you're 16.\\
397 - That-that's a very tumultuous time.\\
398 - I mean, especially with all the sexual issues\\
399 - and the drugs and the internet.\\
400 - Yeah. You gonna eat your chicken skin?\\
401 - Help yourself.\\
402 - You ask me, the skin's the best part.\\
403 - Yeah, but it's not good for you.\\
404 - Anyway, about your life...\\
405 - Hey, there's a business opportunity.\\
406 - Go to all those skinless chicken restaurants,\\
407 - and take the skin that they throw away\\
408 - and open up a restaurant next door named "El Pollo Skin-o."\\
409 - That means "the chicken skin" in Spanish.\\
410 - That's very clever.\\
411 - And guess where we'll open up our first restaurant?\\
412 - Sacramento.\\
413 - Charming.\\
414 - Then Muncie, Indiana, home of Ball State University.\\
415 - Then Lake Titicaca.\\
416 - Not a ball joke, but still funny.\\
417 - Excuse me.\\
418 - (muffled screaming)\\
419 - What are you doing?\\
420 - Screaming into a towel.\\
421 - Oh.\\
422 - I'm gonna watch TV.\\
423 - Okay.\\
424 - *\\
425 - (muffled screaming)\\
426 - * Men. *\\
427 - Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.\\
428 - How many times has that\\
429 - been said in this bed?\\
430 - Or in this chair?\\
431 - Or all over this rug?\\
432 - On the balcony\\
433 - looking at the ocean?\\
434 - (speaking Polish)\\
435 - You're not here!\\
436 - You're not here! None of you are here!\\
437 - Wow, so this is the bedroom.\\
438 - I never got past the couch.\\
439 - What are you complaining about?\\
440 - I never got out of the car.\\
441 - He did me in a little church in Van Nuys.\\
442 - Right in the pew.\\
443 - I would never let him do me in the pew.\\
444 - He dumped me when I said, "I love you."\\
445 - He dumped me\\
446 - when he saw my penis.\\
447 - Me, too.\\
448 - And he never called me again.\\
449 - Why, Charlie?\\
450 - Why didn't you call?\\
451 - (women clamoring)\\
452 - I was busy.\\
453 - I lost your number!\\
454 - I was out of town!\\
455 - You had a penis!\\
456 - You, I don't know what that thing was!\\
457 - (panting)\\
458 - *\\
459 - This isn't happening.\\
460 - This isn't happening.\\
461 - Hey, Charlie. (gasps)\\
462 - Oh, Rose, not you, too.\\
463 - Why not me, too?\\
464 - Look, I'm really sorry about our one-night stand.\\
465 - I know I should've called you.\\
466 - Yes, you should have.\\
467 - Tell you what.\\
468 - After I come down off this stupid pot,\\
469 - How about I'll call the real you\\
470 - and take you out on a proper date,\\
471 - tell you how much you mean to me--\\
472 - how much you've always meant to me?\\
473 - The real me would like that very much.\\
474 - All I could find was donuts and chalupas.\\
475 - Hey, Rose!\\
476 - Wait, you can see her?\\
477 - Yeah, why?\\
478 - (whispering): Can't you?\\
479 - What the hell's going on?\\
480 - You're imagining Berta.\\
481 - Are you really here?\\
482 - I don't know, am I?\\
483 - Call me.\\
484 - Okay, roll another fatty,\\
485 - and let's polish off these donuts.\\
486 - * Men. *\\
487 - Why can't I drive?\\
488 - Because we are carrying a very fragile clock\\
489 - that is worth a lot of money. (sighs)\\
490 - So when you sell it, what are you gonna do with the cash?\\
491 - Uh, I'm not sure.\\
492 - I might buy a new car.\\
493 - I might pay your Uncle Charlie some of what I owe him.\\
494 - Uh, I might put it in your college fund.\\
495 - So what kind of car are you going to get?\\
496 - I got my eye on a Lexus convertible.\\
497 - Sweet. You know what?\\
498 - That means you can have this one.\\
499 - No, thanks.\\
500 - I want to get one of those new Camaros.\\
501 - Red with yellow racing stripes.\\
502 - And then I'm gonna get a big, flaming skull\\
503 - painted on the hood.\\
504 - Don't you think you ought to wait\\
505 - to see how the people at Domino's feel about that?\\
506 - Really?\\
507 - You think I can get a job at Domino's?\\
508 - Hey, a man's reach should exceed his grasp\\
509 - or what's a heaven for?\\
510 - I have no idea what you're talking about.\\
511 - It means that as a human, we should--\\
512 - Oh, no!\\
513 - No, no, no, no, no, no!\\
514 - Now can I drive?\\
515 - * Men.
\subsection {Episode 22: This Is Not Gonna End Well}
1 - * Men.\\
2 - Man, I love German cars.\\
3 - Well, if you keep your nose clean and work hard,\\
4 - someday you'll be able to park them for a living.\\
5 - Excellent.\\
6 - Why is my ass getting hot?\\
7 - You turned on the seat warmer.\\
8 - Oh, good.\\
9 - I was afraid I had another case of swamp ass.\\
10 - Another case?\\
11 - Yeah, it happens every year around this time.\\
12 - Only thing that helps it is aloe vera and Vaseline.\\
13 - I see.\\
14 - Half a tube of each, right in the crack.\\
15 - It's like squirting ketchup and mustard into a hot dog bun.\\
16 - Uh-huh.\\
17 - Then you, like, mash the sides together.\\
18 - Enough.\\
19 - Sorry.\\
20 - You hungry?\\
21 - I'm getting hungry.\\
22 - I may never eat again.\\
23 - Yellow light.\\
24 - I'm slowing down.\\
25 - No, no, no, gun it, gun it!\\
26 - Man, this thing is a rocket ship.\\
27 - Okay, okay, now you can slow down.\\
28 - (siren whooping)\\
29 - Should I run for it?\\
30 - What are you, crazy?\\
31 - Pull over.\\
32 - You told me to run the light.\\
33 - My dad's gonna kill me.\\
34 - Calm down; he's not gonna kill you.\\
35 - How can I calm down? I just got my license,\\
36 - and now I'm gonna lose it!\\
37 - All right, all right.\\
38 - Switch places with me.\\
39 - What?\\
40 - Just do it.\\
41 - And give me your hat.\\
42 - You want my lucky hat?\\
43 - Yeah. I want to share in your good fortune.\\
44 - Evening, Officer.\\

51 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
52 - * Men.\\
53 - Hey. Where have you guys been?\\
54 - Van Nuys.\\
55 - What were you doing in Van Nuys?\\
56 - That's where the jail is.\\
57 - What?\\
58 - I got arrested.\\
59 - You're kidding. What for?\\
60 - Apparently, I ran a red light at 64 miles an hour.\\
61 - And I was in the passenger seat.\\
62 - Yes, I was driving,\\
63 - therefore you were in the passenger seat.\\
64 - Anyway, it turns out\\
65 - I had a couple of unpaid parking tickets.\\
66 - Seventeen.\\
67 - Thank you.\\
68 - They arrested you for unpaid parking tickets?\\
69 - Well, there was also a bench warrant\\
70 - when I didn't show up in court.\\
71 - Well, how could you not show up in court?\\
72 - Don't they send you a summons?\\
73 - Lots of them, but I threw them away.\\
74 - I thought they were for jury duty.\\
75 - Long story short, when I didn't show up,\\
76 - they suspended my license.\\
77 - And I was in the passenger seat.\\
78 - So you were driving with a suspended license?\\
79 - Only for a couple of years.\\
80 - Luckily though, my license was fine,\\
81 - so when they took him to the police station,\\
82 - I followed in the Mercedes.\\
83 - By the way,\\
84 - I reset all your radio stations to good stuff.\\
85 - I'd like to be alone now, Jake.\\
86 - Understandable.\\
87 - You've been through a lot.\\
88 - By the way, if you need anyone to drive you to the movies\\
89 - or the mall or a strip club, I'm available.\\
90 - Appreciate it.\\
91 - And you can just relax in the passenger seat,\\
92 - like I did earlier today.\\
93 - Get out!\\
94 - Listen, I am sorry that you lost your license,\\
95 - but I would be remiss if I did not point out\\
96 - what a bad example you're setting for Jake.\\
97 - Not now, Alan.\\
98 - That young man looks up to you.\\
99 - And when he sees you blatantly disregard the rules of the road,\\
100 - he's more likely to do it himself.\\
101 - (sighs)\\
102 - You're right. You're right.\\
103 - I'm sorry.\\
104 - Are you really?\\
105 - Or you just saying the words?\\
106 - Uh, don't walk away when I am talking to you.\\
107 - I'm gonna count to three, Alan.\\
108 - Oh, that's mature. Three.\\
109 - (punch lands) ALAN: Ow!\\
110 - Where was one and two?\\
111 - (two punches land) Ow! Ow!\\
112 - * Men.\\
113 - Hey.\\
114 - Hey.\\
115 - You know I was just trying to show concern for my son.\\
116 - I do.\\
117 - And you know I was just trying to cause\\
118 - severe nerve damage to your shoulder.\\
119 - I do.\\
120 - You know, we should maybe\\
121 - come up with some kind of safe word.\\
122 - Like "pumpernickel."\\
123 - Sure, whatever.\\
124 - You know, until you get your license back,\\
125 - you can count on me to drive you wherever you need to go.\\
126 - Thanks.\\
127 - Of course, during the week, I'm working.\\
128 - I know.\\
129 - And, uh, and Monday nights, I'm at the senior center.\\
130 - What the hell are you doing at the senior center?\\
131 - Free pilates class.\\
132 - (scoffs)\\
133 - They don't even check IDs.\\
134 - Uh, Tuesdays and Thursday nights,\\
135 - they have water aerobics, uh, Wednesday is low-impact hip-hop,\\
136 - and, uh, Friday is movie night.\\
137 - This week is Cocoon.\\
138 - Again.\\
139 - And of course on Saturday, you know, I need to power down,\\
140 - and, uh, Saturday night...\\
141 - (knocks on table)\\
142 - maybe a date.\\
143 - (chuckles)\\
144 - You're calling those magazines dates now?\\
145 - (laughs)\\
146 - (makes whoosh, pop noises)\\
147 - (laughs)\\
148 - But, hey, any other time\\
149 - you need a ride, I'm your man.\\
150 - Wonderful.\\
151 - Sunday is usually good.\\
152 - Uh-huh.\\
153 - Not this Sunday though; I got a little thing.\\
154 - I know, but what does that have to do with Sunday?\\
155 - (chuckles)\\
156 - Cute, cute.\\
157 - Um, you know, actually,\\
158 - I've been meaning to talk to you about this,\\
159 - but, um, I was waiting for the right time.\\
160 - Are you...\\
161 - (knocks on table)\\
162 - moving out?\\
163 - (laughs)\\
164 - No. But that never ceases to be amusing.\\
165 - Um, anyhoo, turns out,\\
166 - I was invited to Chelsea's birthday party.\\
167 - What?\\
168 - Yeah, well, you know, when she was living here,\\
169 - we were friends, and we've remained friends.\\
170 - She invited you to her birthday party?\\
171 - I won't go if you don't want me to.\\
172 - I don't want you to.\\
173 - Okay.\\
174 - Asked and answered.\\
175 - Done and done.\\
176 - I did buy her a lovely scarf.\\
177 - Will it support your weight from a shower rod?\\
178 - (laughs)\\
179 - Classic.\\
180 - (laughs)\\
181 - Of course, it might be a little awkward if I don't show.\\
182 - Why is that?\\
183 - I volunteered to bring the ice.\\
184 - Is that why you've been filling Ziploc bags\\
185 - with my ice cubes all week?\\
186 - It's exactly the same ice as the kind you have to pay for,\\
187 - sans the fancy polar bear label.\\
188 - I'm not gonna say this again, Alan.\\
189 - I do not want you hanging out with my ex-fianc  e.\\
190 - I hear you, loud and clear.\\
191 - It's just so rare I get to socialize\\
192 - with people my own age.\\
193 - What, there's no free nooky night at the senior center?\\
194 - (forced chuckle)\\
195 - (makes whoosh, bang noises)\\
196 - (laughs)\\
197 - Okay, okay, what if I just go for cocktails and skip dinner?\\
198 - Three? Three.\\
199 - * Men.\\
200 - Alan, wake up.\\
201 - Pumpernickel!\\
202 - You got to go to Chelsea's party.\\
203 - Uh, okay.\\
204 - If you don't go, she's gonna know I told you not to.\\
205 - That's possible.\\
206 - It's a sure thing.\\
207 - She knows you never pass up a free meal.\\
208 - That's not true.\\
209 - How many birthdays have you had at Denny's this year?\\
210 - All right.\\
211 - So you got to go to the party\\
212 - and let her know that I'm doing just fine without her.\\
213 - Okay.\\
214 - But you got to be cool about it.\\
215 - You know, like in passing.\\
216 - Sure, sure. Uh, how's this?\\
217 - Uh, hey, Chelsea, happy birthday.\\
218 - Charlie's doing fine without you\\
219 - and never wanders around the house in the middle of the night\\
220 - with a drink in his hand.\\
221 - Alan.\\
222 - Yeah? You need teeth\\
223 - to say "pumpernickel."\\
224 - Got it.\\
225 - * Men.\\
226 - Oh.\\
227 - Alan, hi.\\
228 - I hope I'm not here early.\\
229 - The, uh, the invite said 8:00.\\
230 - And, uh, 8:00 it is.\\
231 - Come on in.\\
232 - Who is this?\\
233 - That's how you greet a guest?\\
234 - "Who is this?"\\
235 - Okay. Who are you and what the hell\\
236 - you doing here so freaking early?\\
237 - This is Alan, Charlie's brother.\\
238 - Oh.\\
239 - Alan, I'm Ed.\\
240 - Heard a lot about you.\\
241 - Oh, heard a lot about you, too.\\
242 - You know, uh, you being in the Navy with Tom and, uh,\\
243 - you guys keeping in touch, even though you were both married.\\
244 - And, uh, now you're reunited.\\
245 - (chuckles)\\
246 - Great song.\\
247 - (chuckles)\\
248 - * Reunited and feels so good.\\
249 - So where's the birthday girl?\\
250 - Taking a shower.\\
251 - (groans) Women, huh?\\
252 - (chuckles): Always running late.\\
253 - Bet you don't miss that.\\
254 - I brought the ice.\\
255 - Oh!\\
256 - (sighs)\\
257 - I guess the bottom got wet. You know how that is.\\
258 - I mean, because, you know, it happens to everybody,\\
259 - not because you're gay.\\
260 - (quietly): And I thought you were exaggerating.\\
261 - (chuckles)\\
262 - And remember, looky, no touchy.\\
263 - * Men.\\
264 - What's that?\\
265 - A birthday present for Chelsea.\\
266 - But you guys broke up.\\
267 - Yeah, well, I bought it a couple of months ago.\\
268 - Why? 'Cause I thought\\
269 - that's when her birthday was.\\
270 - Turns out, I confused it with St. Patrick's Day.\\
271 - Are those real diamonds?\\
272 - Yep.\\
273 - Burn.\\
274 - What?\\
275 - You could've saved a lot of money with Cuban zirconium.\\
276 - Cuban zirconium?\\
277 - Yeah.\\
278 - Yeah. The girls can't tell\\
279 - 'cause it's just as sparkly as a diamond,\\
280 - and it's cheap 'cause it's from Cuba.\\
281 - Good Lord, you're an idiot.\\
282 - Hey, I'm not the one who wasted a bunch of money\\
283 - on a bracelet for a girl who dumped me.\\
284 - It's not a waste.\\
285 - I'm still going to give it to her.\\
286 - In fact...\\
287 - come on, you're driving me to Chelsea's.\\
288 - Did it occur to you that I might have plans?\\
289 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
290 - Do you have plans?\\
291 - No, but there's a principle involved.\\
292 - I'm just saying, there's a right way,\\
293 - and there's a wrong way.\\
294 - * Men.\\
295 - * Men.\\
296 - You need any condoms?\\
297 - No. Do you?\\
298 - No. I got a buttload.\\
299 - A buttload, huh?\\
300 - You may need to read the instructions more carefully.\\
301 - I don't get it.\\
302 - W-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
303 - Have you used any of them yet?\\
304 - Yeah, sure.\\
305 - For sex?\\
306 - Oh. Um, no.\\
307 - For water balloons.\\
308 - Well, keep a few in reserve,\\
309 - 'cause you're not really breeding stock.\\
310 - So, what are you looking for?\\
311 - Birthday card for Chelsea.\\
312 - Oh. Good idea.\\
313 - (chuckles) Look at this one.\\
314 - Says, "I got you a birthday package."\\
315 - And on the inside, it's a naked fat guy\\
316 - with a hole for you to pop your finger through.\\
317 - Mm, no.\\
318 - Are you sure?\\
319 - He really likes you.\\
320 - Here we go.\\
321 - "Wishing you all the dreams of your heart,\\
322 - "all the love in the world\\
323 - "and the beautiful day you deserve\\
324 - for being so special."\\
325 - That's not funny.\\
326 - Not supposed to be funny.\\
327 - Yeah, well, mission accomplished.\\
328 - (snorts)\\
329 - (chuckles) Look at this one.\\
330 - It's an old lady with long banana boobs\\
331 - and a dog looking at her.\\
332 - And on the inside, it says, "How many were in your litter?"\\
333 - That's not a birthday card.\\
334 - It could be. Write "happy birthday" inside.\\
335 - I need a real birthday card.\\
336 - Okay.\\
337 - Here's one with a puppy on it.\\
338 - "For someone very special on her birthday.\\
339 - Each day is a beautiful gift to enjoy."\\
340 - That's pretty good.\\
341 - Yeah, and then you could cut a hole\\
342 - and pop your pinky through and give that dog a bone.\\
343 - I can't help you if you're not going to work with me.\\
344 - I'm really glad you came, Alan.\\
345 - How could I not?\\
346 - We're friends.\\
347 - I know, but I was afraid it might be uncomfortable for you.\\
348 - No, no. Don't be silly.\\
349 - So, uh, that's it?\\
350 - No dinner? Just finger foods?\\
351 - Sorry.\\
352 - Oh, no, it's fine.\\
353 - I could never have enough prosciutto and melon.\\
354 - Oh. Hey, that'd be a good name for a singing act.\\
355 - Prosciutto and Melon.\\
356 - "Ladies and gentlemen,\\
357 - the song stylings of Prosciutto and Melon."\\
358 - There's an open mic night at the senior center.\\
359 - I'm going to use that.\\
360 - Terrific.\\
361 - So, how's he doing?\\
362 - Who? Alan.\\
363 - Oh, oh, Charlie.\\
364 - Uh, uh, he's doing fine-- just fine.\\
365 - Good, good.\\
366 - In fact, he told me to tell you happy birthday.\\
367 - Oh, that's nice. Tell him I said thanks.\\
368 - I will.\\
369 - And I'm sure he'd say, "You're welcome."\\
370 - So, um, how are you doing?\\
371 - And it's me asking, not Charlie.\\
372 - Although I'm sure he'd be interested.\\
373 - Not that I'd tell him, unless you want me to.\\
374 - Do you want me to? Wait.\\
375 - Tell me how you're doing first, and then we can decide.\\
376 - I'm doing fine, Alan.\\
377 - Good, good. Oh, so is Charlie.\\
378 - Can we change the subject?\\
379 - You're the one who brought it up, but sure.\\
380 - You ever think about your dad and Ed having sex?\\
381 - "Happy birthday, thinking of you."\\
382 - (scoffs softly)\\
383 - What's wrong with it?\\
384 - It's, what to you call it, redumbnent.\\
385 - Redumbnent?\\
386 - Yeah. You got her a present and you got her a birthday card.\\
387 - You're obviously thinking of her.\\
388 - So saying you're thinking of her is redumbnent.\\
389 - So if you act like a moron,\\
390 - saying you're a moron would be redumbnent.\\
391 - Now you're getting it.\\
392 - Oh, buddy, you really shouldn't be walking around\\
393 - without a helmet.\\
394 - Wait here. I'll be right back.\\
395 - Why can't I go with you?\\
396 - Because I'm just gonna give Chelsea the bracelet and leave.\\
397 - Bring me back a piece of cake.\\
398 - Corner with a flower would be nice.\\
399 - (door opens)\\
400 - What the hell are you doing?\\
401 - Um...\\
402 - checking for leaks?\\
403 - Listen...\\
404 - I need you to go up there and give Chelsea the present.\\
405 - Why? Did you wuss out?\\
406 - No, no, I just don't want to make a scene.\\
407 - Here, wuss, wuss, wuss, wuss.\\
408 - Wuss, wuss, wuss...\\
409 - (weakly): wuss... wuss...\\
410 - Just take the bracelet, ring the doorbell,\\
411 - say, "Happy birthday, this is from Uncle Charlie,"\\
412 - and leave.\\
413 - Can I get a piece of cake?\\
414 - Fine, grab a piece of cake.\\
415 - What if they haven't cut the cake yet? Can I hang out?\\
416 - No. I'm not gonna sit here waiting for you.\\
417 - Well, you don't really have choice.\\
418 - You're not allowed to drive.\\
419 - What are you saying?\\
420 - Well, at the risk of being redumbnent,\\
421 - I'm saying I'll be having cake.\\
422 - I can't believe I'm being blackmailed by Forrest Gump.\\
423 - Can I tell her you're waiting out here?\\
424 - No! Are you nuts?\\
425 - I was just thinking it'd be a good way to get a second piece of cake.\\
426 - Get out of here!\\
427 - (sigh) Run, Forrest, run.\\
428 - What if I meet a cute girl up there?\\
429 - Would you mind walking home?\\
430 - Jake, I swear to God,\\
431 - do not make me get out of this car.\\
432 - Excuse me, let's not forget who's doing who a favor here.\\
433 - Go.\\
434 - Yes, sir.\\
435 - Extra large?\\
436 - Yeah, maybe if he wears it as a lucky hat.\\
437 - So, what about the blonde?\\
438 - Is she single?\\
439 - Yeah, but she's a little crazy.\\
440 - Mm, not a deal breaker.\\
441 - The well-adjusted ones generally won't come near me.\\
442 - Hey, Dad.\\
443 - What are you doing here?\\
444 - Uncle Charlie wanted me to give Chelsea this birthday present.\\
445 - Here.\\
446 - So, have you cut the cake yet?\\
447 - Uh, no.\\
448 - We haven't even sung "Happy Birthday" yet.\\
449 - Oh.\\
450 - * Happy birthday\\
451 - (others joining in): * To you\\
452 - * Happy birthday\\
453 - * To you\\
454 - * Happy birthday\\
455 - * Dear Chelsea\\
456 - * Happy birthday\\
457 - * To you.\\
458 - WOMAN: Yay!\\
459 - Thank you.\\
460 - Thank you for coming.\\
461 - Excuse me, I need to get some air.\\
462 - Wasn't me-- I always claim 'em, you know that.\\
463 - Come on, Skipper.\\
464 - So, where's the cake?\\
465 - (clicks on radio)\\
466 - (changes station)\\
467 - (changes station)\\
468 - Aw, geez!\\
469 - (flask clatters)\\
470 - (engine starts)\\
471 - (crashing)\\
472 - Oh, this is not gonna end well.\\
473 - Charlie?\\
474 - Hey, Chels.\\
475 - Happy birthday!\\
476 - * Men...\\
477 - * Men...\\
478 - Hey, did I tell you Uncle Charlie's gonna pay me\\
479 - to drive him back and forth to work?\\
480 - Oh, that's nice.\\
481 - CHARLIE (calls): I'm ready!\\
482 - Yeah, I get to drive his car twice a day\\
483 - for three to six months, depending on good behavior.\\
484 - CHARLIE: Move it, numbnuts!\\
485 - Smart money's on six.

\subsection {Episode 01: Three Girls and a Guy Named Bud}
1 - (watch beeps)\\
2 - (beeping continues)\\
3 - What the hell is that?\\
4 - Oh, sorry.\\
5 - I set my alarm so I could go home before Jake wakes up.\\
6 - Turn it off!\\
7 - I'm trying, but my arm's asleep.\\
8 - Aah. There. Whew.\\
9 - I can't believe you have a watch alarm.\\
10 - Yeah, it's a Timex.\\
11 - Well, a really nice knockoff.\\
12 - Even has indiglo. See?\\
13 - Oh! Oh, for God's sake, it's 6:00 a.m.\\
14 - Oh, I know, sorry.\\
15 - We agreed we don't want our kids to know about us.\\
16 - Yeah, yeah, good-bye.\\
17 - Bye.\\
18 - Guess a little morning quickie is out of the question.\\
19 - If you can do it without waking me up.\\
20 - You're not really thinking about it, are you?\\
21 - * Men. *\\
22 - Dear Lord.\\
23 - Charlie?\\
24 - Huh?\\
25 - You okay?\\
26 - Sure.\\
27 - Why do you ask?\\
28 - 'Cause... you're passed out on the stairs.\\
29 - Really?\\
30 - (groans)\\
31 - Oh, that's not good.\\
32 - How much did you have to drink last night?\\
33 - Let's see...\\
34 - I don't know.\\
35 - I wonder how I got my pants off over my shoes.\\
36 - Maybe you took your shoes off, and then put them back on.\\
37 - Think it through, Alan.\\
38 - For what possible activity\\
39 - would I need my pants off and my shoes on?\\
40 - I don't know.\\
41 - Chasing a reluctant hooker?\\
42 - Can't rule it out.\\
43 - So... where have you been?\\
44 - I was with Lyndsey.\\
45 - Who's Lyndsey?\\
46 - Eldridge's mom.\\
47 - Who's Eldridge?\\
48 - Jake's friend?\\
49 - Jake is my son.\\
50 - I know who Jake is.\\
51 - What I don't know is where my pants are.\\
52 - Excuse me.\\
53 - (Charlie retching)\\
54 - (garbage disposal grinding)\\
55 - Guess who had a Cobb salad for dinner.\\
56 - Charming. I'm, uh, I'm going to go lay down.\\
57 - You know, Jake may not be the brightest monkey in the meadow,\\
58 - but even he's going to eventually figure out\\
59 - that you're banging his buddy's mom.\\
60 - Don't worry. I'll tell him when the time is right.\\
61 - And when is that?\\
62 - When I'm sure that Lyndsey and I\\
63 - have built a solid relationship that will last.\\
64 - In the meantime,\\
65 - I don't want to complicate his friendship with Eldridge.\\
66 - Lyndsey's son, right?\\
67 - Right.\\
68 - (growls): Ha!\\
69 - Yeah. Yeah, very good.\\
70 - The point is, I haven't said anything to Jake because\\
71 - in a lot of ways, he's still a little boy.\\
72 - He's not very sophisticated when it comes to adult sexual...\\
73 - ...relationships.\\
74 - Yours?\\
75 - Alan, she's like, 16.\\
76 - And... again I ask--\\
77 - hoping I won't be called to testify...\\
78 - Yours?\\
79 - No, she's coming from Jake's room.\\
80 - Why would a girl be leaving Jake's room\\
81 - at 7:00 in the morning?\\
82 - Why do you think?\\
83 - Oh, come on! He's 16!\\
84 - Not everybody waits till they're a junior in college, Alan!\\
85 - A sophomore, and I still wasn't emotionally ready.\\
86 - Well, obviously your kid's a little more advanced.\\
87 - No. No, this is unacceptable.\\
88 - He and I are going to have to have a little talk.\\
89 - Maybe he can give you some tips.\\
90 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
91 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
92 - * Men. *\\
93 - Unbelievable.\\
94 - My little boy spent the night with two girls.\\
95 - Two so far.\\
96 - What?\\
97 - We don't have a final tally.\\
98 - There might be more clowns in that car.\\
99 - You think?\\
100 - At this point, anything's possible.\\
101 - There's only one way to find out.\\
102 - Hang on, hang on.\\
103 - Come here.\\
104 - Let's think this through.\\
105 - What is there to think through?\\
106 - The possibility of my son hosting an orgy?\\
107 - Now, not to be a stickler,\\
108 - but technically an orgy requires a minimum of six participants.\\
109 - What?\\
110 - It goes... masturbation, one-on-one, threesome,\\
111 - two couples swinging,\\
112 - two couples swinging with a looky-loo, orgy's six.\\
113 - It frightens me that you know that.\\
114 - Everybody knows that.\\
115 - Well, whatever you call it, it needs to be nipped in the bud.\\
116 - Now we're talking three girls and a guy named Bud.\\
117 - (angry sigh)\\
118 - What are you gonna do? Punish him?\\
119 - Well, what do you want me to do? Give him a merit badge?\\
120 - Well, it is quite an accomplishment.\\
121 - This is not funny, Charlie!\\
122 - Hey, I'm not laughing.\\
123 - The kid's doing better than I am.\\
124 - I woke up on the stairs alone.\\
125 - Oh, you're up.\\
126 - These were in the mailbox.\\
127 - What the hell were they doing in the mailbox?\\
128 - I don't know, but there's postage on 'em.\\
129 - Well, I clearly had a plan of some kind.\\
130 - What's everybody doing up so early?\\
131 - We just saw two girls sneaking out of Jake's room.\\
132 - Two?\\
133 - Two.\\
134 - Taterhead had a threesome?\\
135 - We don't know that.\\
136 - Maybe they were having an all-night study session.\\
137 - My God, he had a threesome.\\
138 - Morning.\\
139 - Morning. Morning. Morning.\\
140 - Hungry?\\
141 - Yep.\\
142 - Thirsty?\\
143 - Mm-hmm.\\
144 - Proud?\\
145 - What?\\
146 - Ignore him.\\
147 - So, what'd you wind up doing last night?\\
148 - Nothin'.\\
149 - Nothing, you say.\\
150 - So, just an evening alone in your room.\\
151 - Pretty much.\\
152 - Quiet? Uneventful?\\
153 - Boring?\\
154 - I guess.\\
155 - Nothing I have to clean up?\\
156 - Nope. Wait... I did have a sandwich in bed.\\
157 - I knew it!\\
158 - What are you talking about?\\
159 - We saw the girls, Jake.\\
160 - Well, this is awkward.\\
161 - Two hotties, sneaking out of your room. Up top, little stud!\\
162 - Charlie!\\
163 - This does not call for a high-five.\\
164 - You're right.\\
165 - It's hugging time. Come here, you dog.\\
166 - Stop it! Stop it! Stop it.\\
167 - I want to know what those girls were doing in your room.\\
168 - He told you: They were making a sandwich.\\
169 - Would you please?!\\
170 - I am waiting for an answer.\\
171 - All right. Their names were Tiffany and Joanne,\\
172 - and they're from my school and they're into surfing.\\
173 - Terrific. So what were they doing in your room!?\\
174 - Hey, chill! I'm gettin' to it.\\
175 - Yeah, chill!\\
176 - He's gettin' to it.\\
177 - They were going to sleep in their car so they could hit the waves\\
178 - as soon as the sun came up, and I said they could crash here.\\
179 - CHARLIE: So...\\
180 - nothing happened?\\
181 - No, we're just friends. I slept on the floor.\\
182 - Aww... Aww...\\
183 - This is not "Aww."\\
184 - This is "Yay!"\\
185 - Yay. Yay.\\
186 - So when I asked you about last night, why did you lie?\\
187 - It's usually the simpler path.\\
188 - And, and why didn't you ask permission\\
189 - before asking your friends over?\\
190 - You weren't around.\\
191 - Where were you, by the way?\\
192 - I went to the gym.\\
193 - A little, little cardio, uh,\\
194 - spinning class, light weights, uh,\\
195 - you know, I'm just into maintenance, not bulking up.\\
196 - Don't find that attractive.\\
197 - I prefer the lean, mean swimmer's body.\\
198 - You know, like...\\
199 - Jesus.\\
200 - Nice, Alan. Drag our Lord into it.\\
201 - Anyway, you still could've called me.\\
202 - Or-Or asked your uncle.\\
203 - You didn't answer your phone,\\
204 - and Uncle Charlie was busy trying to mail his pants.\\
205 - Oh good, good, you saw that.\\
206 - Did I happen to mention why I was doing it?\\
207 - Nope.\\
208 - And you didn't ask?\\
209 - Over the years I've learned to look the other way.\\
210 - All right, all right, let's... let's not get off-track here.\\
211 - The important thing is that if you're gonna\\
212 - have company, you give one of us a heads-up.\\
213 - Fine.\\
214 - Oh, hey, look.\\
215 - There's a note in my pocket.\\
216 - "Dear Inspected By Number 94...\\
217 - "It is with a heavy heart that I write to you.\\
218 - "The zipper you signed off on has snagged my ball sack.\\
219 - "Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\\
220 - Sincerely yours, Charles Francis Harper."\\
221 - Well, that explains the blood in my shorts.\\
222 - I hope.\\
223 - LYNDSEY: I've got a little surprise for you!\\
224 - Well, I've got a--\\
225 - what I'm told is a perfectly adequate surprise for you.\\
226 - You like?\\
227 - Oh, yes. (chuckles)\\
228 - Your surprise has greatly enhanced my surprise.\\
229 - Oh, is that whipped cream, or are you planning to shave me?\\
230 - I mean, y'know, I'm fine either way.\\
231 - It's whipped cream, Alan.\\
232 - Oh, okay. Uh, fat-free?\\
233 - 'Cause I'm trying to cut down.\\
234 - Relax. You're not going to be the one licking it up.\\
235 - (whipping cream whooshing)\\
236 - Oh!\\
237 - Well, bon appetit.\\
238 - (giggles)\\
239 - (door slams)\\
240 - ELDRIDGE: Ma!\\
241 - Damn.\\
242 - Eldridge! Why aren't you in school?\\
243 - ELDRIDGE: It's a half day! Teachers' conference.\\
244 - How come I didn't know about that?\\
245 - ELDRIDGE: I don't know.\\
246 - Jake's gonna stay for dinner, okay?\\
247 - Uh... did he ask his dad?\\
248 - JAKE: Yes, Mrs. MacElroy, he said it's fine.\\
249 - No, he didn't, he's totally lying!\\
250 - Shh!\\
251 - He's been lying a lot lately.\\
252 - Boy, you try to bring a kid up with some values.\\
253 - Hand me a tissue, will you?\\
254 - The whipped cream's dripping into my crack. Okay.\\
255 - Want some pie?\\
256 - Sure. Got any whipped cream?\\
257 - Usually we do.\\
258 - I don't see it.\\
259 - Man, we go through a lot of whipped cream in this house.\\
260 - (thudding)\\
261 - (dog barking)\\
262 - Was that my dad?\\
263 - * Men. *\\
264 - * Men. *\\
265 - Hi.\\
266 - Hello.\\
267 - Did you know Rottweilers are attracted\\
268 - to the scent of whipped cream?\\
269 - Matter of fact, I did know that.\\
270 - Mmm.\\
271 - I just learned it.\\
272 - Mmm.\\
273 - Jake almost caught me\\
274 - sneaking out of Lyndsey's house.\\
275 - Really?\\
276 - Close call.\\
277 - One question.\\
278 - Yeah?\\
279 - Whose idea was it to\\
280 - spice things up with a large dog?\\
281 - The dog was not with us in bed.\\
282 - The dog was being walked\\
283 - by a nine-year-old girl\\
284 - who was not quite capable of holding onto the leash\\
285 - when he got a whiff of\\
286 - my non-fat, dairy-scented crotch.\\
287 - Okay. Okay.\\
288 - I'm not judging,\\
289 - but why was a nine-year- old girl walking her dog\\
290 - through Lyndsey's bedroom?\\
291 - No. The girl was on the street\\
292 - with the dog.\\
293 - Oh. Hmm.\\
294 - All right, another question.\\
295 - I was on the street\\
296 - 'cause I was sneaking out of Lyndsey's house.\\
297 - Ah!\\
298 - You know, for such a boring guy,\\
299 - you lead a very complicated life.\\
300 - Yeah, it's a paradox, isn't it?\\
301 - Iced tea?\\
302 - I decided when you try to mail your pants\\
303 - to a garment inspector in Malaysia,\\
304 - it's time to quit drinking.\\
305 - Some might say that day came and went\\
306 - when you gave yourself that haircut.\\
307 - But good for you.\\
308 - Yep. (clears throat)\\
309 - Long overdue.\\
310 - You want a beer?\\
311 - I did. And I am.\\
312 - My drinking days are over.\\
313 - See? Beer.\\
314 - (door slams)\\
315 - JAKE: Hello?\\
316 - Uh... uh... in here!\\
317 - Ixnay on the ottweiler-Ray!\\
318 - What?\\
319 - The oggy-day who tried to ite-bay my alls-bay.\\
320 - Hey, buddy!\\
321 - I'm not your buddy.\\
322 - What?\\
323 - I just came to get my stuff.\\
324 - I'm staying with Mom and Herb from now on.\\
325 - Why?\\
326 - I saw you sneaking out\\
327 - of Eldridge's house.\\
328 - Oh, Alan, no!\\
329 - Are you crazy, having sex with my best friend's mom?\\
330 - Shame on you!\\
331 - I had no idea, Jake.\\
332 - I, I, I, I was gonna tell you,\\
333 - you know, eventually.\\
334 - You're such a liar.\\
335 - Oh, oh, oh, I'm a liar?\\
336 - What were you doing at Eldridge's in the first place?\\
337 - You certainly didn't ask permission from me!\\
338 - Attaboy.\\
339 - Trying to take the high road\\
340 - with a crotch full of whipped cream and dog spittle.\\
341 - * Men. *\\
342 - Ah.\\
343 - You know, I feel a lot better since I've stopped drinking.\\
344 - Yeah, we're all proud of you.\\
345 - I have more energy,\\
346 - I'm certainly more clear-headed.\\
347 - In fact, the only downside is\\
348 - I might have to put a chip clip on my johnson\\
349 - to keep from peeing my pants.\\
350 - I really screwed up, Charlie.\\
351 - I should've been honest with Jake from the beginning.\\
352 - Just told him I was seeing his friend's mother.\\
353 - Or, you could've not slept with his friend's mother\\
354 - in the first place.\\
355 - Really?\\
356 - You're going to preach sexual restraint to me?\\
357 - Let me explain something to you, Alan.\\
358 - Jake expects me to betray his trust.\\
359 - You, on the other hand, are held to a higher standard.\\
360 - Is that so? It is!\\
361 - You're like some kind of right-wing,\\
362 - pro-family values senator,\\
363 - caught on his knees in an airport toilet\\
364 - with a male hooker.\\
365 - Whereas I am a well-known rascal.\\
366 - When I don't do the wrong thing,\\
367 - people are disappointed.\\
368 - Is that supposed to make me feel better?\\
369 - No, the story was about me.\\
370 - God, you're such a narcissist.\\
371 - You know what, I can't just sit here and do nothing.\\
372 - I owe Jake an apology.\\
373 - You're going to Judith's? I'll come with you.\\
374 - Why? Why?\\
375 - You're my brother, I want to support you.\\
376 - Really? Nah, I'm just outta beer.\\
377 - But I do love that you still fall for that.\\
378 - * Men. *\\
379 - JUDITH: Well, I hope you're proud of yourself.\\
380 - I am. I haven't had a drink all day.\\
381 - She was talking to me, Charlie,\\
382 - and no, I'm not.\\
383 - Okay, Millie's finally asleep.\\
384 - Ooh, is that real beer?\\
385 - Knock yourself out.\\
386 - Oh, thanks! I'm gonna regret this in the morning.\\
387 - My God, Alan, I can't believe you're sleeping with Lyndsey MacElroy.\\
388 - You're sleeping with Lyndsey MacElroy?\\
389 - My man!\\
390 - How could you do that?\\
391 - Yeah, how?\\
392 - Don't leave anything out.\\
393 - Well, it just happened.\\
394 - Her son and Jake are friends, which is how we met,\\
395 - and we, you know, hit it off.\\
396 - You don't sleep with your son's friend's mother.\\
397 - No, no.\\
398 - You marry his pediatrician.\\
399 - He's got you there, sweetie.\\
400 - You know, there's a rumor going around\\
401 - that Lyndsey was in a soft-core porn movie\\
402 - before she got married.\\
403 - Really? Which one?\\
404 - I don't know, but I've been checking Cinemax\\
405 - every night for months.\\
406 - Oh, I love their stuff.\\
407 - It's classy, right?\\
408 - A little story, nice lighting,\\
409 - and you never have to see the guy's junk.\\
410 - What is wrong with you?\\
411 - You don't like seeing that stuff, either.\\
412 - I think that's enough beer, sweetheart.\\
413 - I'll get Jake.\\
414 - There you go, pal.\\
415 - Thanks, but you heard her. I've had enough.\\
416 - Boy, oh, boy, Lyndsey MacElroy.\\
417 - You are one lucky ducky.\\
418 - Yeah, she's very beautiful.\\
419 - You know, sometimes I drive past her house\\
420 - and she's out watering her lawn in her shorty shorts\\
421 - and her halter top.\\
422 - Cowabunga!\\
423 - JUDITH: No one wants to talk to him,\\
424 - but he's your father.\\
425 - Oh, hey, buddy.\\
426 - What do you want?\\
427 - What I want is to apologize\\
428 - for not telling you about me and Eldridge's mom.\\
429 - You know, this is between you guys.\\
430 - I'm just gonna go take a hot shower.\\
431 - Eldridge doesn't want to be friends with me anymore.\\
432 - Oh, I am so sorry. But, but this can't be the first time\\
433 - something like this has happened.\\
434 - I mean, how many times has your Uncle Charlie\\
435 - slept with somebody you knew?\\
436 - Yeah, but I expect that from him.\\
437 - See, Alan? I'm Teflon.\\
438 - You're a perv, is what you are.\\
439 - And it's not just that you were sleeping with her,\\
440 - it's that you lied to me about it.\\
441 - You're right.\\
442 - I should've told you the truth.\\
443 - And, and Lyndsey should've told Eldridge.\\
444 - But when it happened, we didn't know if it would even last.\\
445 - I just don't like you keeping things from me.\\
446 - That's fair, and, and, and I'll make you a deal.\\
447 - From now on, I will be open and honest with you\\
448 - and you'll do the same with me.\\
449 - Deal? I guess.\\
450 - Thanks.\\
451 - I have to go finish my homework.\\
452 - Okay. So, uh... I'll see you this weekend?\\
453 - Sure.\\
454 - Great. (sighs) Love you, buddy.\\
455 - Don't push it, Dad.\\
456 - You're lucky he's so forgiving.\\
457 - Takes after his mom, huh?\\
458 - Um, you know, we should go.\\
459 - I gotta pee. You mind, Judith?\\
460 - Just try to hit the bowl this time.\\
461 - Don't worry, I only miss when I've been drinking.\\
462 - ALAN: I'll wait in the car.\\
463 - Hey, Judith?\\
464 - Is there surfing around here?\\
465 - What are you talking about?\\
466 - We're 20 miles from the beach.\\
467 - That's what I thought.\\
468 - I am so proud of that kid.\\
469 - * Men. *\\
470 - Isn't this nice?\\
471 - The four of us sitting down, having dinner.\\
472 - Open. Honest.\\
473 - No secrets.\\
474 - Yeah. Thrilling.\\
475 - (laughs)\\
476 - So, Jake, your dad tells me\\
477 - you're getting into the surfing scene?\\
478 - What do you mean?\\
479 - You know, uh, Tiffany and Joanne.\\
480 - Oh, yeah. Right.\\
481 - Tiffany and Joanne surf?\\
482 - Yes, Eldridge. They surf.\\
483 - Charlie? Would you like some pizza?\\
484 - No, thanks.\\
485 - I'm kinda on a health kick.\\
486 - Didn't you tell me he quit drinking?\\
487 - He actually thinks he did.\\
488 - (cell phone rings)\\
489 - Hello?\\
490 - Oh, hey, Herb! S'up?\\
491 - Really?\\
492 - Right now?\\
493 - Hang on.\\
494 - (classy soft porn music plays)\\
495 - Are you sure?\\
496 - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
497 - Lyndsey?\\
498 - Hmm?\\
499 - Never mind.\\
500 - (whispering): You're right, it's her!\\
501 - Okay, Herb. Thanks.\\
502 - Great. Have a nice shower.\\
503 - (whipped cream whooshing on TV)\\
504 - Boy, she sure does like the whipped cream.
\subsection {Episode 02: A Bottle of Wine and a Jackhammer}
1 - * Men.\\
2 - (heavy breathing)\\
3 - Sorry.\\
4 - It's okay, Alan.\\
5 - I don't have to have an orgasm every time we make love.\\
6 - I did my best.\\
7 - It's just that my sinuses are a little blocked\\
8 - and I needed my mouth for breathing.\\
9 - Don't worry about it. You were great.\\
10 - "A" for effort.\\
11 - Yeah, but on my report card\\
12 - it's still going to say "incomplete."\\
13 - Don't dwell on that.\\
14 - Let's just enjoy being together.\\
15 - I am enjoying it.\\
16 - Ooh, thirsty.\\
17 - I need to tell you something.\\
18 - Uh-huh.\\
19 - I think I love you, Alan Harper.\\
20 - (gasps)\\
21 - (coughs)\\
22 - Did it go down the wrong way?\\
23 - Yeah, that seems to be the theme of the evening.\\
24 - (coughs)\\
25 - Are you going to leave me hanging?\\
26 - You said it was okay. You told me to stop.\\
27 - You know what I mean.\\
28 - I just told you I love you.\\
29 - Oh, oh, that.\\
30 - Oh, well, you know, it goes without saying\\
31 - that I feel the same way.\\
32 - Then say it.\\
33 - (scoffs) Okay.\\
34 - (high-pitched): I love you, Lyndsey.\\
35 - Why?\\
36 - Why?\\
37 - What do you love about me?\\
38 - Oh, well, what's not to love?\\
39 - You know, you're-you're beautiful and-and-and\\
40 - strong and smart and sexy.\\
41 - Uh-huh.\\
42 - Uh, confident,\\
43 - um, loyal, thrifty.\\
44 - Clean.\\
45 - Yeah?\\
46 - Persistent.\\
47 - Well, why do you love me?\\
48 - I don't know, I just do.\\
49 - That's not fair.\\
50 - Why did I get the essay question?\\
51 - I think you should move in.\\
52 - (choking)\\
53 - You want me to move in here?\\
54 - Why not?\\
55 - We love each other.\\
56 - Plus, our sons get along.\\
57 - They can walk to school from here,\\
58 - Jake's mom lives just down the street,\\
59 - and there's plenty of room for him on weekends.\\
60 - Sounds like you've been giving this a lot of thought.\\
61 - I have.\\
62 - Is that why I got an incomplete,\\
63 - 'cause you were distracted?\\
64 - No.\\
65 - Oh.\\
66 - Can you think of any reasons why we shouldn't live together?\\
67 - Uh, no, not off the top of my head.\\
68 - Which you were staring at for quite a while.\\
69 - (nervous chuckle)\\
70 - Look, I don't want to back you into a corner.\\
71 - Why don't you think about it.\\
72 - Yeah, yeah, why don't I sit with it for a day or two.\\
73 - And you can think about why you love me.\\
74 - Okay.\\
75 - Mm.\\
76 - Oh, I guess I should be getting home soon.\\
77 - If you lived here, you'd be home already.\\
78 - That's true.\\
79 - That's funny-- I always see those signs on the freeway,\\
80 - "If you lived here, you'd be home already."\\
81 - And, you know, I can't help but think,\\
82 - if I lived there, I'd have a big sign outside my window\\
83 - ruining my perfectly good view of the freeway.\\
84 - And if you lived next to the freeway,\\
85 - you wouldn't be getting this.\\
86 - Mmm, mmm, hang on.\\
87 - Let's just wet the ol' whistle.\\
88 - My mouth. I'm talking about mouth.\\
89 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
90 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
91 - * Men.\\
92 - Yeah, hi.\\
93 - I'm watching your commercial, Cash for Gold,\\
94 - and you just showed a woman\\
95 - selling her wedding ring for $500.\\
96 - No, I don't want to sell gold.\\
97 - I want to meet that woman.\\
98 - She's hot\\
99 - and we know her marriage isn't working out.\\
100 - Hey.\\
101 - Call you back.\\
102 - You got any gold in your teeth?\\
103 - A little. Why?\\
104 - Just thinking.\\
105 - Lyndsey told me she loves me tonight.\\
106 - Really? What'd you say?\\
107 - What could I say? "I love you, too."\\
108 - Do you love her?\\
109 - Yeah, sure.\\
110 - What's not to love?\\
111 - Oh, I don't know.\\
112 - Her mood swings, her idiot teenage son\\
113 - and the fact that you need a muscle relaxer,\\
114 - a bottle of wine and a jackhammer to get her off.\\
115 - Hey, I told you about that in confidence.\\
116 - Who else is here?\\
117 - The same two people know.\\
118 - All right, well, let's keep it that way.\\
119 - She also said she wants me to move in with her.\\
120 - Is that forever or just till you get her off?\\
121 - Charlie...\\
122 - You're right, you're right, you're right,\\
123 - that's a distinction without a difference.\\
124 - Are you listening to me?\\
125 - Lyndsey said she wants me to move out of here\\
126 - and in with her.\\
127 - Oh, you were serious.\\
128 - Well, that's great. Congratulations.\\
129 - When are you leaving?\\
130 - I don't know.\\
131 - I told her I'd think about it.\\
132 - What's to think about?\\
133 - She's a terrific gal and she can make you happy.\\
134 - But you just said...\\
135 - Oh, please, that was just me crackin' wise.\\
136 - Everybody's got a little baggage.\\
137 - I drink and try to mouth kiss hookers.\\
138 - You, you're cheap, annoying and no one likes you.\\
139 - Lyndsey likes me.\\
140 - Which is why you should move in with her.\\
141 - But this is my home, I'm comfortable here.\\
142 - No, no, no, no, this is my home...\\
143 - ...and before you moved into it, I was comfortable here.\\
144 - Now, now, you always say that, but you don't mean it.\\
145 - Yes, I do.\\
146 - Why won't you ever believe me?\\
147 - Come on, after all these years,\\
148 - you're saying you wouldn't miss me if I was gone?\\
149 - I'm saying I'd very much like the chance to find out.\\
150 - Please, Alan, give me that chance.\\
151 - No, I don't think so.\\
152 - My relationship with Lyndsey is fine the way it is.\\
153 - I can come and go as I please, I have my own space...\\
154 - No, no, no, no, no, you have my space.\\
155 - Also a distinction without a difference.\\
156 - So that's it? You're not leaving?\\
157 - Like I said, I'm comfortable here.\\
158 - Comfortable, huh?\\
159 - Okay, my path is clear.\\
160 - Oh.\\
161 - I can grow tomatoes upside down.\\
162 - * Men.\\
163 - (knocking on door)\\
164 - Hey, you awake?\\
165 - No, I can keep going.\\
166 - Alan. Alan.\\
167 - Oh, hi.\\
168 - What's up?\\
169 - I need a favor.\\
170 - Okay, sure. What is it?\\
171 - I got this girl upstairs\\
172 - and I need you to take care of her bird.\\
173 - Okay, when you say "bird,"\\
174 - what exactly is it you're referring to?\\
175 - Get your mind out of the gutter.\\
176 - Her bird.\\
177 - Here.\\
178 - Guess what his name is.\\
179 - Mothra?\\
180 - Larry.\\
181 - Larry Bird?\\
182 - Get it?\\
183 - Chick's from Boston.\\
184 - Anyway, I'd put him in the living room,\\
185 - but Larry didn't like to be alone.\\
186 - Oh. Okay, I guess.\\
187 - Thanks.\\
188 - Oh, yeah, don't put your hands near his face.\\
189 - And if you get up to pee,\\
190 - make sure you close the bathroom door.\\
191 - Why?\\
192 - I don't know, he's got this thing about penises.\\
193 - He thinks they're big worms.\\
194 - Or L.A. Lakers. Good night.\\
195 - Good night.\\
196 - (squawks) Spank me!\\
197 - What?\\
198 - I'm a bad girl, spank me!\\
199 - Oh, for God's sake.\\
200 - Too big, too big.\\
201 - All right, all right, Larry, go to sleep.\\
202 - That's it, baby. Oh, yeah.\\
203 - You're the best.\\
204 - (urinating)\\
205 - (squawking)\\
206 - (Alan screams)\\
207 - Not a worm! Not a worm!\\
208 - * Men.\\
209 - (laughing)\\
210 - And let me tell ya,\\
211 - it wasn't easy finding a hooker with a big bird.\\
212 - Snakes, no problem. They all got snakes.\\
213 - Shh, shh, shh, here he comes.\\
214 - Thanks again for watching Larry.\\
215 - I'd say bite me, but that's been taken care of.\\
216 - Hey, I'm sorry if that made you uncomfortable,\\
217 - but from time to time, I do entertain women in this house.\\
218 - That thing tried to re-circumcise me.\\
219 - Maybe that's why they call it a cockatoo.\\
220 - I know what you're doing, and it's not gonna work.\\
221 - What ever are you talking about?\\
222 - I tell you I'm not moving in with Lyndsey\\
223 - 'cause I'm comfortable here, and three hours later\\
224 - you put a giant penis-eating parrot in my room.\\
225 - And you think there's a connection?\\
226 - (mocking tone): Yes, I think there's a connection.\\
227 - Damn it.\\
228 - How do you get a guy to leave your house\\
229 - who doesn't want to go?\\
230 - Tell him you missed your period and you're out of pot.\\
231 - Always worked for me.\\
232 - * Men.\\
233 - CHARLIE: Hey, Alan, how are you with the jumble?\\
234 - Charlie?\\
235 - What are you doing in here?\\
236 - Right now, the jumble.\\
237 - O-L-C-U-D?\\
238 - Cloud!\\
239 - Cloud. Thank you.\\
240 - What are you doing in my bathroom?!\\
241 - Not much yet, but I have high hopes.\\
242 - Come on, Charlie, this is ridiculous.\\
243 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
244 - Am I making you uncomfortable?\\
245 - Not enough to make me move in with Lyndsey.\\
246 - Okay.\\
247 - How about now?\\
248 - * Men.\\
249 - All right, bottom line, what would it take\\
250 - to make you want to move in with Lyndsey?\\
251 - For the last time, there is no conceivable circumstance\\
252 - where I would entertain leaving Malibu\\
253 - and moving in with Lyndsey.\\
254 - (doorbell rings)\\
255 - Next time you drop the soap in the shower,\\
256 - I'm gonna forget you're my brother.\\
257 - Jake, your father's here!\\
258 - Hello, Alan.\\
259 - Charlie. How's it going?\\
260 - Great.\\
261 - Did you hear Lyndsey MacElroy\\
262 - invited Alan to move in with her?\\
263 - What?\\
264 - She lives right down the street.\\
265 - I know. You and Alan would be neighbors.\\
266 - Cool, huh? Now, hang on.\\
267 - I didn't say I was gonna do it.\\
268 - You bet your ass you're not gonna do it.\\
269 - I will not have my ex-husband living down the street from me.\\
270 - So you're saying it would make you uncomfortable?\\
271 - Uncomfortable?\\
272 - It would drive me crazy.\\
273 - Jake, damn it, get a move on!\\
274 - I'm moving in with Lyndsey.\\
275 - * Men.\\
276 - * Men.\\
277 - How's the pizza?\\
278 - Awesome. JAKE: Great.\\
279 - It's a new takeout place.\\
280 - A little more expensive,\\
281 - but it's worth it.\\
282 - LYNDSEY: And for dessert, we have red velvet cupcakes.\\
283 - Oh, man, those are my favorite.\\
284 - Hang on, Eldridge.\\
285 - Something's wrong here.\\
286 - Are you sending us to military school?\\
287 - No.\\
288 - Of course not. Why would you think that?\\
289 - I don't know.\\
290 - 16 years of bargain pizza with fake cheese\\
291 - and Sam's Club vanilla wafers for dessert?\\
292 - I don't want to go to military school.\\
293 - No one's going to military school.\\
294 - But there is, uh, something we wanted to talk to you about.\\
295 - Here it comes.\\
296 - Relax, it's good news.\\
297 - Alan.\\
298 - All right, uh, as you both know,\\
299 - uh, Lyndsey and I have been dating now for six months.\\
300 - Oh, man, did he knock you up?\\
301 - No.\\
302 - Just be quiet and listen.\\
303 - Anyway, uh, we've both grown\\
304 - very fond of each other during that time.\\
305 - You are using protection, right?\\
306 - That's none of your business,\\
307 - but I'm glad you're paying attention in health class.\\
308 - Uh, but what I'm trying to say\\
309 - is that Lyndsey and I\\
310 - have decided\\
311 - to live together.\\
312 - I don't think Uncle Charlie's gonna like that.\\
313 - He's never been real pleased that you and I moved in.\\
314 - Uh, no, no, no.\\
315 - We're going to live at Lyndsey's and Eldridge's house.\\
316 - But I stay here, right?\\
317 - No. When you're not at your mom's,\\
318 - you'll be with us.\\
319 - So, I'm losing my weekend beach house?\\
320 - Yeah, but you're gaining a whole family.\\
321 - I'd rather have a weekend beach house.\\
322 - Do I have to share my bathroom with him?\\
323 - Eldridge.\\
324 - What's wrong with sharing a bathroom with me?\\
325 - I like my privacy.\\
326 - Yeah, we all know what that's about.\\
327 - Jake!\\
328 - You're Mr. Whack-a-Mole, not me.\\
329 - Yeah, well, at least I don't watch gay porn.\\
330 - That was a total accident!\\
331 - I don't want to live with him.\\
332 - Well, you don't have to worry about it, 'cause I'm not going.\\
333 - Guys, guys, come on. No!\\
334 - Forget it. I mean, it's bad enough\\
335 - you're sleeping with this loser.\\
336 - Eldridge!\\
337 - Are you calling my dad a loser?\\
338 - You call him a loser all the time.\\
339 - He's my dad, I'm allowed.\\
340 - Uh, well, Jake, technically you're not allowed.\\
341 - Is it okay for me to call your mom what you call her?\\
342 - What do you call me? ALAN: Okay,\\
343 - we've gotten off track here.\\
344 - (chuckles)\\
345 - Uh, who's ready for cupcakes?\\
346 - Screw you and your cupcakes.\\
347 - Yeah.\\
348 - I'll just, uh, take one for later.\\
349 - * Happy days are here again\\
350 - * The skies above are clear again *\\
351 - * I'm getting rid of the queer again *\\
352 - * Happy days are here again\\
353 - Hey.\\
354 - Hey there. Ho there.\\
355 - What are you doing?\\
356 - Just thought I'd help you\\
357 - get a jump on the packing.\\
358 - Oh, oh.\\
359 - Well, you can unpack, 'cause I'm not leaving.\\
360 - What?\\
361 - No.\\
362 - The boys just won't go along with it.\\
363 - You're giving those two morons a vote?\\
364 - It's too traumatic.\\
365 - You know, turning their lives upside down.\\
366 - So? Let them be traumatized.\\
367 - That's the trouble with kids these days, not enough trauma.\\
368 - Charlie, I'm sorry.\\
369 - I know you were looking forward to having the house\\
370 - back to yourself, but it's just not gonna happen.\\
371 - Oh, it's gonna happen.\\
372 - As God is my witness, and by all that's holy, it's gonna happen.\\
373 - Amen.\\
374 - Keep packing.\\
375 - (sighs)\\
376 - He couldn't spell "miscellaneous"?\\
377 - It's my life and my house.\\
378 - I don't need your permission.\\
379 - I don't care!\\
380 - I'll just go live with Dad and Stephanie!\\
381 - Oh, won't that be nice.\\
382 - You'll be reunited with your old babysitter.\\
383 - Excuse us. Walk.\\
384 - Dude. Don't "dude" me.\\
385 - I'm in no mood for "dude." Ow, ow, ow, ow.\\
386 - Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.\\
387 - (turns off TV)\\
388 - Dude.\\
389 - Don't "dude" him, dude.\\
390 - All right, what's this I hear\\
391 - about you guys not wanting to live together?\\
392 - I want my privacy and... I like it here. I mean, come on...\\
393 - It was a rhetorical question!\\
394 - I don't give a rat's ass!\\
395 - Now, the happiness of your parents is at stake here.\\
396 - So we're gonna reason this out like adults,\\
397 - in the interest of all involved.\\
398 - Here's $500.\\
399 - Split it up any way you want.\\
400 - Nice. Whoa.\\
401 - And that's just a down payment.\\
402 - There's extra hundred in it for every month\\
403 - you keep my brother out of my house.\\
404 - $100 a month?\\
405 - That's, like, $1,000 a year.\\
406 - Almost.\\
407 - Do we have a deal?\\
408 - Deal. Deal.\\
409 - Great.\\
410 - I should write a book on parenting.\\
411 - How are we supposed to split this?\\
412 - I don't know, dude.\\
413 - No matter how I figure it, there's gonna be one left over.\\
414 - * Men.\\
415 - (piano playing "Hit The Road Jack")\\
416 - * Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back *\\
417 - * No more, no more, no more, no more *\\
418 - * Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more. *\\
419 - Okay, we're leaving.\\
420 - What you say?\\
421 - I said we're all packed and we're leaving.\\
422 - I know, I know. I heard you.\\
423 - I just never get tired of hearing it.\\
424 - Jake, say good-bye to your uncle.\\
425 - Bye.\\
426 - Bye.\\
427 - That's it? After all these years?\\
428 - Um, I had a good time here.\\
429 - Who wouldn't?\\
430 - It's a beach house in Malibu.\\
431 - That's what I told him.\\
432 - So I guess I'll see you at your high school graduation.\\
433 - (chuckles): Good one.\\
434 - I'll meet you at Lyndsey's.\\
435 - Drive safe.\\
436 - (inhales deeply)\\
437 - Well, here we are.\\
438 - Final good-bye.\\
439 - One can only hope.\\
440 - Come here.\\
441 - You've been a good brother.\\
442 - You were here when I needed you,\\
443 - and I will be forever in your debt.\\
444 - So, it's official, you're never paying me back.\\
445 - Boy, we had some great times\\
446 - in this old place.\\
447 - You're walking the wrong way, Alan.\\
448 - (chuckles)\\
449 - Remember when you set us up with those two\\
450 - hot soap opera actresses, and then we both got the flu?\\
451 - (laughs)\\
452 - Soap opera actresses...\\
453 - (harp plays)\\
454 - Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.\\
455 - Drive carefully.\\
456 - Oh, come on.\\
457 - Um, how about when you found me handcuffed to my bed\\
458 - wearing a bustier and fishnet stockings?\\
459 - (harp plays)\\
460 - Sorry. Blanking on that, too.\\
461 - Well, yeah, but-but you got to remember when we did the...\\
462 - Alan, Alan, Alan, let me save you some trouble.\\
463 - My past is divided between things I can't remember\\
464 - and things I don't want to remember.\\
465 - And you're both.\\
466 - Right.\\
467 - Then, uh, wish me luck.\\
468 - You don't need luck.\\
469 - You guys were meant for each other.\\
470 - In fact, let me start you off on the right foot.\\
471 - Here's a hundred bucks.\\
472 - Stop by the liquor store on the way\\
473 - to your new home, pick up a bottle\\
474 - of champagne to celebrate with Lyndsey.\\
475 - (chuckles): A hundred bucks?\\
476 - For that kind of cash, I could get a very decent bottle\\
477 - of Chardonnay and still have some walking around money.\\
478 - Get the champagne, Alan.\\
479 - Right. It's your money. (chuckles)\\
480 - Exactly.\\
481 - We end as we began.\\
482 - All right, so, uh, I guess I'll call you.\\
483 - Yeah.\\
484 - Make sure you leave a message.\\
485 - (laughs)\\
486 - See, that's what I'm gonna miss.\\
487 - Th-the banter, the good-natured ribbing, the...\\
488 - (sighs)\\
489 - I admit I had my doubts, Lord.\\
490 - But you have delivered me unto the promised land.\\
491 - You're right, I should change the locks.\\
492 - That's why you're the Lord.\\
493 - * Men.\\
494 - Boy, I didn't even realize they made wine in Oklahoma.\\
495 - That'll be $8.49.\\
496 - Mm. Here you are.\\
497 - That's a hundred-dollar bill.\\
498 - You owe me $91.51.\\
499 - Alan?\\
500 - Melissa?\\
501 - What a coincidence.\\
502 - Yeah! How have you been?\\
503 - Okay. You?\\
504 - Fine. (chuckles)\\
505 - How's Jake?\\
506 - Oh, uh, he's good.\\
507 - Charlie?\\
508 - Ah, same old.\\
509 - (both laugh) You look great.\\
510 - You, too. Gorgeous.\\
511 - Aw, thanks.\\
512 - (both chuckle)\\
513 - I've missed you.\\
514 - I've missed you, too.\\
515 - So, seeing anybody?\\
516 - Nope. You?\\
517 - No.\\
518 - * Men.\\
519 - for you to call me out in the middle of the night like this.\\
520 - You're doing God's work.\\
521 - Excuse me, pardon me.\\
522 - Alan? I'll explain later.\\
523 - Hey, Charlie.\\
524 - Hey.\\
525 - Don't worry, I'm still moving in with Lyndsey.\\
526 - This will just be my pied-  -terre.\\
527 - Uh, that's French for "love shack."\\
528 - Okay, that's it. Let me speak to your supervisor.
\subsection {Episode 03: A Pudding-Filled Cactus}
1 - I think you should move in. (gasps)\\
2 - You bet your ass you're not going to do it.\\
3 - I'm moving in with Lyndsey.\\
4 - Alan. Lyndsey and I\\
5 - have decided to live together.\\
6 - Well, here we are.\\
7 - Final good-bye.\\
8 - One can only hope.\\
9 - Alan?\\
10 - Melissa?\\
11 - I've missed you.\\
12 - So, seeing anybody?\\
13 - Nope. You?\\
14 - No.\\
15 - Alan? I'll explain later. Hey, Charlie.\\
16 - Don't worry, I'm still moving in with Lyndsey.\\
17 - This will just be my pied-  -terre.\\
18 - I'm sorry I have to go. Me, too.\\
19 - I mean that you have to go, not that I have to go.\\
20 - Why would I have to go? I live here.\\
21 - Can we do this again?\\
22 - Again?\\
23 - Well, maybe you can do it again, but men are different.\\
24 - I mean another time.\\
25 - Oh, oh, sure. Why not?\\
26 - I live here.\\
27 - Okay. Bye.\\
28 - Bye.\\
29 - All right, I know what you're going to say.\\
30 - I don't think you do.\\
31 - It was wrong. I'm cheating on Lyndsey.\\
32 - I'm lying to Melissa...\\
33 - No, no, no, no, no.\\
34 - What I was going to say is, you don't live here.\\
35 - You moved out! Ah...\\
36 - Not officially.\\
37 - I never actually made it to Lyndsey's house.\\
38 - Speaking of which, I should get going.\\
39 - Alan, Alan, listen to me.\\
40 - If you screw this up with Lyndsey, you're going wind up back here.\\
41 - And you need to understand something.\\
42 - There is no back here.\\
43 - I got it, got it.\\
44 - You know, it was a crazy impulse.\\
45 - Old girlfriend-- it was a one time thing.\\
46 - Uh, well, technically it was a two time thing.\\
47 - The second one was in the shower.\\
48 - Well, that is where you've been practicing.\\
49 - You know,\\
50 - you have to admit this is a very curious turn of events.\\
51 - I mean, seven years ago I arrived on this very doorstep\\
52 - heartbroken and alone.\\
53 - And you had chicks coming out the kazoo.\\
54 - (chuckles)\\
55 - Now look at us.\\
56 - The student has become the master.\\
57 - Arrigato, sensei.\\
58 - Ow!\\
59 - You're welcome, grasshopper.\\
60 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
61 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
62 - * Men.\\
63 - Lyndsey, you in here?\\
64 - LYNDSEY: What took you so long?\\
65 - I was getting worried.\\
66 - Oh, well, saying good-bye to Charlie turned out\\
67 - to be tougher than I thought it was going to be.\\
68 - He didn't want to see his baby brother go.\\
69 - You're kidding. Nope.\\
70 - You know, Charlie may be prickly and crusty\\
71 - on the outside, but inside, he's all soft and gooey.\\
72 - Kind of like a pudding-filled cactus.\\
73 - Well, I'm glad you're back,\\
74 - (singsongy): because I have a moving in present for you.\\
75 - Oh, great.\\
76 - (whispers): Please don't be sex, please don't be sex.\\
77 - Ta-da!\\
78 - Oh, boy, sex.\\
79 - I sent the kids to the movies,\\
80 - so it's just you and me.\\
81 - So no interruptions.\\
82 - Goody.\\
83 - Come on, unwrap your present.\\
84 - All right, um, but how about, uh,\\
85 - we make this one about your pleasure?\\
86 - Aren't you in the mood?\\
87 - Of course I'm in the mood.\\
88 - I'm a man.\\
89 - Men are always in the mood.\\
90 - Mmm, sex.\\
91 - Shh, shh, shh.\\
92 - How about we do the first one fast,\\
93 - and the second one nice and slow.\\
94 - Second one...\\
95 - Oh, yay.\\
96 - * Men.\\
97 - End of an era, huh, Charlie?\\
98 - Yep.\\
99 - From now on, no brother, no nephew.\\
100 - Just the sounds of the ocean\\
101 - punctuated by the soft voices of prostitutes\\
102 - lying about the enormity of my sexual organ.\\
103 - You do know how to paint a picture.\\
104 - What can I say-- I have the heart of a poet.\\
105 - Unfortunately, the rest of you is a drunken scumbag.\\
106 - Cheers.\\
107 - Ah. Ah.\\
108 - ALAN: Hello?\\
109 - Don't move, don't breathe.\\
110 - Charlie? Berta?\\
111 - Oh, there you are.\\
112 - Um, listen,\\
113 - I know I said it was a one time thing with Melissa,\\
114 - but she called and wanted to see me and I just couldn't say no.\\
115 - So she's coming here?\\
116 - This is where I live.\\
117 - You know, as far as she's concerned.\\
118 - Could you excuse me for a minute?\\
119 - Take your time.\\
120 - Thank you.\\
121 - Come, let's talk.\\
122 - Okay... Are you insane?!\\
123 - Have you lost your mind?!\\
124 - I know, I know it's crazy.\\
125 - I know my future is with Lyndsey,\\
126 - but I have so much chemistry with Melissa.\\
127 - You can't keep this up!\\
128 - Don't I know it. Last time I was with Melissa,\\
129 - I had to fake an orgasm with Lyndsey.\\
130 - What?!\\
131 - How does a man fake an orgasm?\\
132 - (erotic moaning)\\
133 - Ah! Ah! Ah...!\\
134 - I get it. I get it. I get it.\\
135 - (yelling)\\
136 - Please. Please, I'm begging you.\\
137 - (doorbell rings) Oh.\\
138 - Okay, that's Melissa.\\
139 - No, Alan, this ends now.\\
140 - I swear, last time.\\
141 - Oh, you got any Viagra?\\
142 - What?!\\
143 - Not for now--\\
144 - for when I go home to Lyndsey, so I don't to, you know,\\
145 - (yelling)\\
146 - God, I missed you. I missed you, too.\\
147 - Hey, Charlie.\\
148 - Hey.\\
149 - I know a guy.\\
150 - Ten grand, you'll never have to see Zippy again.\\
151 - Ten grand?\\
152 - Actually he charges $500, but there's a finders fee.\\
153 - * Men.\\
154 - Alan, dinner's on the table.\\
155 - Coming.\\
156 - You're a great cook, Mrs. MacElroy.\\
157 - Jake, I told you, call me Lyndsey.\\
158 - Yes, ma'am.\\
159 - You are such a sweetie.\\
160 - You could learn something from him.\\
161 - Suck up.\\
162 - Suck up with a drumstick.\\
163 - Hey, I noticed this old pipe on the mantle. It's a beauty.\\
164 - Oh, it was my grandfather's.\\
165 - Oh, wow. They don't make 'em like this anymore.\\
166 - (as Bing Crosby): Hello, boys.\\
167 - How about a little orange juice with your dinner?\\
168 - * Ba-ba-ba-bom.\\
169 - Is he high?\\
170 - I wish.\\
171 - I love a man with a pipe.\\
172 - You should get some tobacco for it.\\
173 - Your dad's gonna smoke a dead guy's pipe.\\
174 - Yeah, well, at least he didn't get hair plugs\\
175 - and ralph on my babysitter like your dad.\\
176 - Ow!\\
177 - Ow!\\
178 - Now boys, behave yourselves,\\
179 - or I'll pull out my ba-ba-ba-belt.\\
180 - Alan, sit down.\\
181 - White meat or dark meat?\\
182 - I'll take a... * Ba-ba-ba-breast.\\
183 - Is that supposed to be somebody?\\
184 - (normal voice): It's Bing Crosby.\\
185 - Oh.\\
186 - Who?\\
187 - Bing Crosby. The black guy with the sweater.\\
188 - He used to have a TV show.\\
189 - That's Will Smith, dumbass.\\
190 - * Men.\\
191 - (doorbell rings)\\
192 - Huh. That's weird.\\
193 - (doorbell rings)\\
194 - What the hell?\\
195 - Hey, Charlie.\\
196 - Oh, boy.\\
197 - Isn't this nice-- eating together as a family?\\
198 - (as Bing Crosby): It certainly is, Mother.\\
199 - Maybe afterwards we can gather around the fireside\\
200 - and sing a song or two.\\
201 - Seriously, Alan, that's not funny anymore.\\
202 - And don't call me "Mother."\\
203 - (normal voice): Sorry.\\
204 - ("Up, Up and Away" ringtone playing)\\
205 - And in this house, we don't talk on the phone during dinner.\\
206 - Oh, right, yeah.\\
207 - Terrific rule, but, uh, but I just have to take this.\\
208 - Hey, Charlie, what's up?\\
209 - Oh... Oh, she's there now?\\
210 - Well, what do you want me to do?\\
211 - We're all going to die, Charlie.\\
212 - No, no, no, don't send her over here!\\
213 - No, I'll be right there.\\
214 - Just give me a minute.\\
215 - Okay, let me tell you something.\\
216 - This is now my house, too.\\
217 - If I want to talk on the phone, I'm gonna talk on the phone.\\
218 - What's wrong with you? Don't you nag me, woman.\\
219 - Where are you going?\\
220 - I'm going to take a drive and cool off...\\
221 - Mother.\\
222 - * Men.\\
223 - Here you go. Thanks.\\
224 - Doesn't Alan usually come home right after work?\\
225 - Usually.\\
226 - Hope he didn't get into an accident.\\
227 - Nah, I'm not that lucky.\\
228 - How can you say that?\\
229 - I'm just stating a fact.\\
230 - Charlie, I'm home from work.\\
231 - Melissa?\\
232 - What the heck.\\
233 - I wanted to surprise you, but you were so late,\\
234 - we started to worry.\\
235 - She's using the royal "we."\\
236 - I would have been home earlier,\\
237 - but we had, uh, a situation at the office.\\
238 - Oh, no.\\
239 - What happened?\\
240 - Um, well, I, uh, uh, lost a patient.\\
241 - Oh, my God, someone died?\\
242 - Oh, no, no, no.\\
243 - Uh, not, you know, lost like died.\\
244 - Uh, more like, uh, uh, misplaced.\\
245 - Oh, thank goodness.\\
246 - Yeah. CHARLIE: Hey, Alan?\\
247 - Yeah?\\
248 - I'm just wondering--\\
249 - how does a chiropractor misplace a patient?\\
250 - Good question.\\
251 - I thought so.\\
252 - Well, uh, uh, he's an elderly fellow\\
253 - who in addition to scoliosis,\\
254 - uh, also has dementia.\\
255 - So I-I just spent the last hour and a half\\
256 - driving up and down Ventura Boulevard\\
257 - looking for a, you know, shirtless, hunched over 80-year-old man.\\
258 - Found quite a few.\\
259 - But none of them were mine.\\
260 - So he's still out there?\\
261 - Yeah.\\
262 - Did you call the police?\\
263 - Yes, Charlie, I did.\\
264 - What did they say?\\
265 - They thanked me for my help,\\
266 - and, uh, told me to go home\\
267 - and let them do their job.\\
268 - So, uh, so here I am-- home.\\
269 - Better late than never.\\
270 - Oh, please, you've never given never a chance.\\
271 - Do you mind?\\
272 - Actually I do. I thought I made that clear.\\
273 - All right, all right.\\
274 - Melissa, we can't do this anymore.\\
275 - I agree. You do?\\
276 - Yes. I think I should move in here with you.\\
277 - Here?\\
278 - Here?\\
279 - Why don't we talk about it after we make love.\\
280 - Uh, okay.\\
281 - It could work.\\
282 - * Men.\\
283 - * Men.\\
284 - (both moan)\\
285 - Okay, I'm just gonna go home and get some things.\\
286 - I'll be back in a little while.\\
287 - Great. (chuckles)\\
288 - That's really getting annoying.\\
289 - Do me a favor, talk me through this.\\
290 - Excuse me?\\
291 - What's your strategy?\\
292 - 'Splain it to me, Lucy!\\
293 - Okay, admittedly, I may have overplayed my hand a little.\\
294 - A little?\\
295 - You're living with Lyndsey and you asked Melissa\\
296 - to move in here!\\
297 - Yeah, I got to work on that.\\
298 - So, listen,\\
299 - when Melissa comes back, make some sort of excuse. Uh...\\
300 - Oh, what, you mean like "I was cruising Ventura Boulevard\\
301 - for an old, shirtless hunchback"?\\
302 - Yeah, not my finest moment.\\
303 - You're experienced at that kind of thing.\\
304 - No, no, I'm experienced at promiscuity.\\
305 - This is polygamy.\\
306 - And frankly, I find it extremely distasteful.\\
307 - Oh, oh, this you find distasteful?\\
308 - The man who was asked to leave Bangkok for moral turpitude\\
309 - finds this distasteful?\\
310 - That was a misunderstanding.\\
311 - Mmm.\\
312 - I had no idea\\
313 - it was an endangered species.\\
314 - Well, nothing I'm doing requires a ten-day quarantine\\
315 - and a series of rabies shots.\\
316 - Oh. Hello.\\
317 - Oh, Mom, thank God you're here.\\
318 - Your sarcasm is unappreciated, Charlie.\\
319 - No, no, really. You got to talk to Alan\\
320 - and tell him not to screw up this thing with Lyndsey.\\
321 - Who's Lyndsey? My girlfriend.\\
322 - You have a girlfriend?\\
323 - He moved in with her.\\
324 - You moved in with a girlfriend?\\
325 - Yeah, and he's cheating on her with his ex-girlfriend,\\
326 - and he invited that one to move in here.\\
327 - When were you planning to tell me all this?\\
328 - We're telling you now.\\
329 - So as usual,\\
330 - I'm the last to know.\\
331 - Mom, Mom, focus.\\
332 - He moved out.\\
333 - After seven years of putting up with him and his kid,\\
334 - he finally moved out.\\
335 - So Jake is gone, too?\\
336 - No one thought to call me.\\
337 - Okay, as usual, you're just useless.\\
338 - Alan, this can't go on any longer.\\
339 - You have to choose between Lyndsey and Melissa,\\
340 - and you have to choose now.\\
341 - You're right, you're right.\\
342 - What to do?\\
343 - When did he start smoking a pipe?\\
344 - I don't know. This is new.\\
345 - (cell phone chimes) That's probably Lyndsey.\\
346 - Which one is Lyndsey?\\
347 - The one he moved in with.\\
348 - What's wrong with her?\\
349 - Single mom, teenage son.\\
350 - So desperate?\\
351 - Like a goldfish in a leaky bag.\\
352 - Oh, my God.\\
353 - (chuckles): Lyndsey is apologizing to me.\\
354 - Says she was wrong.\\
355 - About what?\\
356 - What difference does it make?\\
357 - I won an argument with a woman.\\
358 - Which is why she's the gal for you.\\
359 - Go to her.\\
360 - Love her, cherish her.\\
361 - I don't know.\\
362 - Okay, then take her for granted and treat her like crap\\
363 - until she hangs herself, but go!\\
364 - What about Melissa?\\
365 - You have to break that off.\\
366 - You're right, you're right.\\
367 - I have to step up and be a man.\\
368 - What are you doing?\\
369 - I'm telling Melissa it's over.\\
370 - With a text?\\
371 - Well, I'm putting a little sad face at the end.\\
372 - All right, well, uh, guess it's time to go home\\
373 - and come clean with Lyndsey.\\
374 - No, no, no. No coming clean.\\
375 - Unless you're banging Mr. Bubble.\\
376 - But I-I don't want to build our new life together\\
377 - on a foundation of lies.\\
378 - Oh, yes, you do.\\
379 - Listen to your mother.\\
380 - Trust me.\\
381 - No good ever comes from revealing an indiscretion.\\
382 - And you know this how?\\
383 - I'd rather not say.\\
384 - Wait, so you're saying when you were married...\\
385 - Whoa, whoa, when did everything become about me?\\
386 - When we were born.\\
387 - Hey, don't get me started on that.\\
388 - My episiotomy still itches.\\
389 - My point, Alan, is, it is not fair to ease your conscience\\
390 - by dumping your sins on the woman you love.\\
391 - Yeah, Alan, don't be selfish.\\
392 - (cell phone chimes)\\
393 - (groans) What now?\\
394 - Oh.\\
395 - Melissa's not taking it well.\\
396 - "I hate you, you stupid cork soaker"?\\
397 - Auto spell check.\\
398 - Anyway... I got to go.\\
399 - Bye, Mom.\\
400 - (sighs)\\
401 - Okay, we dodged a bullet.\\
402 - Yep. So now that he's gone,\\
403 - what are you gonna do with that empty room?\\
404 - Uh, why do you ask?\\
405 - I was just thinking, it might be nice to spend\\
406 - the occasional weekend here on the beach.\\
407 - Oh, darling, you should see your face.\\
408 - (laughs)\\
409 - * Men.\\
410 - Hey.\\
411 - Oh, thank God you're back.\\
412 - Sorry I stormed off like that.\\
413 - No, no, you had every right.\\
414 - I'm sorry I treated you like you were some kind of houseguest.\\
415 - That's okay, I'm used to it.\\
416 - Seven years with Charlie, a dozen years with Judith\\
417 - and all that time with my mom.\\
418 - Well, from now on, this house is your home.\\
419 - And if you want to talk on the phone during dinner,\\
420 - you just go right ahead and do it.\\
421 - Really?\\
422 - Can I hang my chiropractor of the year plaque on the wall?\\
423 - Of course.\\
424 - In the living room?\\
425 - Wherever you want.\\
426 - Charlie made me hang it in my bathroom.\\
427 - Well, I'm not Charlie.\\
428 - And I'm proud you're chiropractor of the year.\\
429 - Oh, oh, not this year, uh, 2002.\\
430 - After that, they tightened up the voting rules.\\
431 - So, uh, what about acidophilus milk?\\
432 - What about it?\\
433 - I like it. Then we'll get it.\\
434 - And I can keep it in the refrigerator?\\
435 - Where else would you keep it?\\
436 - Charlie made me keep all my dairy products\\
437 - in an ice chest in the garage.\\
438 - That's terrible.\\
439 - I lost so much cheese.\\
440 - Oh, honey.\\
441 - Well, this is your home now.\\
442 - And you can put your cheese wherever you want.\\
443 - Can I sing show tunes in the shower?\\
444 - Charlie didn't let you sing show tunes?\\
445 - No, that was my mother.\\
446 - Said I was effeminate enough already.\\
447 - Well, as far as I'm concerned, you are all man.\\
448 - Oh, Lyndsey.\\
449 - You're too good to me.\\
450 - Oh, it's only what you deserve.\\
451 - (chuckles)\\
452 - Okay, I-I can't live with this guilt.\\
453 - I have to confess something.\\
454 - What?\\
455 - Okay.\\
456 - Uh, a few days ago, I-I ran into an ex-girlfriend,\\
457 - who I had a lot of chemistry with.\\
458 - And you had sex with her.\\
459 - Let me finish.\\
460 - No.\\
461 - I-I did not have sex with her.\\
462 - Then why do you feel guilty?\\
463 - Uh, well, after I ran into her,\\
464 - I, uh, uh, I-I found myself,\\
465 - uh, fantasizing a-about her.\\
466 - Fantasizing? That's it?\\
467 - That's it.\\
468 - Uh, and nothing crazy, just straight missionary.\\
469 - Sweetie, we all fantasize.\\
470 - Every time I go to the car wash, I imagine myself\\
471 - being bent over a soapy BMW by a man with calloused hands\\
472 - and no green card.\\
473 - Really?\\
474 - Every time?\\
475 - It's not always a BMW.\\
476 - Come on, let's go to bed.\\
477 - (chuckles): S  , se  orita.\\
478 - Don't ruin it.\\
479 - * Men.\\
480 - (doorbell rings)\\
481 - Oh, crap.\\
482 - Where is he? I don't know.\\
483 - I'm gonna give you one last chance.\\
484 - Where is he?\\
485 - I'm sorry. I don't...\\
486 - (screams)\\
487 - (gasping)\\
488 - (groaning)\\
489 - What's going on?\\
490 - She kneed me in the nuts.\\
491 - What'd you do to her?\\
492 - Nothing.\\
493 - What'd he do to you?\\
494 - He won't tell me where his brother is.\\
495 - I can't.\\
496 - I'm not a rat.\\
497 - What are you going to do to Alan when you find him?\\
498 - Oh, same thing I did to Charlie, but worse.\\
499 - He's at Lyndsey's.\\
500 - 1182 Bonnie Meadow Drive.\\
501 - Sherman Oaks, big blue house.\\
502 - Uh-oh.\\
503 - (groans)\\
504 - (retching)\\
505 - I'm sorry, Charlie.\\
506 - (groaning)\\
507 - Oh, stop whining.\\
508 - On some level, I'm sure you had it coming.\\
509 - * Men.\\
510 - So I was thinking of\\
511 - turning that little storage room into a den.\\
512 - You know, kind of a man cave.\\
513 - Whatever you want, sweetie.\\
514 - Really? Mm-hmm.\\
515 - So I can get a flat screen, maybe a wet bar?\\
516 - If that's what it takes to make you happy here.\\
517 - Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.\\
518 - Enough talking.\\
519 - Let's make love in our home.\\
520 - Oh, yes, our home.\\
521 - (both chuckle)\\
522 - (both moaning)\\
523 - Do you smell something burning?\\
524 - * Men.\\
525 - Here you go.\\
526 - Thank you.\\
527 - How are you feeling?\\
528 - I think she punched my right nut up into my rib cage.\\
529 - Poor baby.\\
530 - You want Mommy to take a look?\\
531 - No, thanks.\\
532 - I have seen them before.\\
533 - I know.\\
534 - I imagine they're hanging a lot lower now.\\
535 - Right back at ya, Mom.\\
536 - Touch  , darling.\\
537 - You will never guess what happened.
\subsection {Episode 04: Hookers, Hookers, Hookers}
1 - Lyndsey and I have decided to live together.\\
2 - End of an era, huh, Charlie?\\
3 - From now on, no brother, no nephew...\\
4 - just the sounds of the ocean punctuated by the soft voices\\
5 - of prostitutes lying about the enormity of my sexual organ.\\
6 - Alan, dinner's on the table!\\
7 - Hey, I noticed this old pipe on the mantle.\\
8 - It's a beauty.\\
9 - Oh, it was my grandfather's.\\
10 - Oh, wow, they don't make 'em like this anymore.\\
11 - So now that he's gone,\\
12 - what are you gonna do with that empty room?\\
13 - Uh... why do you ask?\\
14 - I was just thinking, it might be nice\\
15 - to spend the occasional weekend here on the beach.\\
16 - Well, from now on, this house is your home.\\
17 - Do you smell something burning?\\
18 - * Men.\\
19 - Whoo, what a day.\\
20 - Mmm-hmm.\\
21 - Who could've seen this one coming?\\
22 - Oh, please-- after seven years, you know,\\
23 - I finally move out of your house,\\
24 - and within two days, I burn my new home down.\\
25 - You can't write this stuff.\\
26 - I could if I used your skin for paper and your blood for ink.\\
27 - I just want you to know that as soon as we get\\
28 - the insurance money and repair the fire damage,\\
29 - Lyndsey and the boys and I will be out of your hair for good.\\
30 - Unless, of course, you burn her house down again.\\
31 - (laughs) Funny.\\
32 - See? That's what we need at times like this-- laughter.\\
33 - (snide laugh)\\
34 - I'm gonna take that as laughter!\\
35 - Trust me, Eldridge is a great kid,\\
36 - and you're gonna love Lyndsey.\\
37 - If you can open up your mind just a little,\\
38 - you will really enjoy having them here.\\
39 - LYNDSEY: Damn it, Eldridge! Why the hell did you try\\
40 - to flush a washcloth down the toilet?!\\
41 - I'm not enjoying it yet, Alan.\\
42 - Charlie, you got a mop?\\
43 - Laundry room. Thank you.\\
44 - Need any help, sweetie?\\
45 - No, but if I need my house burned down again,\\
46 - I'll let you know.\\
47 - See? She is keeping\\
48 - a sense of humor about it. (chuckles)\\
49 - You've ruined my entire life, you know that?\\
50 - You're right, I like her.\\
51 - We've got a lot in common.\\
52 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
53 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
54 - * Men.\\
55 - What do you want me to tell you, Chris?\\
56 - If you want to see your son,\\
57 - you're gonna have to come to Malibu.\\
58 - Oh, grow up!\\
59 - You think I planned to have the house burn down?\\
60 - It was an accident!\\
61 - It was, you know.\\
62 - LYNDSEY: Drop dead!\\
63 - (phone clatters)\\
64 - Whoo, I'd say she's a little miffed with your dad.\\
65 - I'd say she wants to tear him a new one.\\
66 - Hey! watch your language.\\
67 - What'd I say?\\
68 - New one.\\
69 - Mmm, honey, honey,\\
70 - uh, just a little heads up,\\
71 - um, the boys could hear you out there.\\
72 - I don't give a rat's ass what they can hear!\\
73 - His father's a jerk and you burned down my freakin' house!\\
74 - Our house.\\
75 - Dear God, stop talking.\\
76 - Aw, damn!\\
77 - Hey, Berta.\\
78 - Bet you're surprised to see me back.\\
79 - It's my own fault. I let myself believe.\\
80 - Well, I want you to meet my girlfriend Lyndsey.\\
81 - And this is her son Eldridge.\\
82 - And they're gonna be staying with us for a little while.\\
83 - What'd he do, burn down your house? (laughs)\\
84 - It was an accident!\\
85 - Hello, everyone.\\
86 - I hope you all slept well.\\
87 - If there's anything I can do\\
88 - to make your stay here more comfortable,\\
89 - please be sure to tell me.\\
90 - Thank you, Charlie. That is so...\\
91 - Uh! He doesn't mean it.\\
92 - Hey, Uncle Charlie?\\
93 - Yeah?\\
94 - You miss me?\\
95 - He missed me.\\
96 - * Men.\\
97 - Honestly, I don't see why you can't live here.\\
98 - You're kidding, right?\\
99 - There's no roof.\\
100 - So wear a hat.\\
101 - My great grandmother's candlesticks.\\
102 - Oh, Lyndsey, I'm sorry.\\
103 - She smuggled these out of Denmark\\
104 - when the Nazis invaded.\\
105 - Really? Where'd she hide 'em?\\
106 - Charlie, don't go there.\\
107 - Oh, like I'm the only one?\\
108 - Look at the bright side.\\
109 - Even though we've lost some material items,\\
110 - the important thing is we're all safe\\
111 - and we've still got each other, right.\\
112 - You're making my skin crawl.\\
113 - Hey, guys... smile.\\
114 - It's for your Christmas card.\\
115 - All my stuff is wrecked.\\
116 - Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.\\
117 - Sorry isn't gonna bring back\\
118 - my guitar or my X-Box\\
119 - or the history paper that's due tomorrow\\
120 - that I totally had finished.\\
121 - Where's Eldridge?\\
122 - He's drying out his weed in the backyard.\\
123 - Weed?!\\
124 - Wii.\\
125 - Nintendo Wii.\\
126 - I better go help him.\\
127 - I could use a little Wii right now.\\
128 - Is this my Armani jacket?\\
129 - Oh! Oh, yeah. You know,\\
130 - I don't know how that got in with my things.\\
131 - I was gonna bring it back.\\
132 - But now that you're here,\\
133 - why don't you just take it with you?\\
134 - Saves me the trip.\\
135 - You know what? Happy birthday.\\
136 - Not much of a birthday present.\\
137 - HERB: Ding-dong.\\
138 - Hi, neighbor.\\
139 - We saw your cars out front.\\
140 - Hey, Judith.\\
141 - Incredible, huh?\\
142 - Wow, this place is a wreck.\\
143 - But still livable.\\
144 - What are you gonna do?\\
145 - Well, till the place gets fixed up,\\
146 - we're all staying in Malibu with Charlie.\\
147 - Really?\\
148 - All of you...\\
149 - at Charlie's? What are you smiling about?\\
150 - You know what I'm smiling about.\\
151 - Well, I hope the repairs go quickly\\
152 - so we get you back here real soon.\\
153 - Thanks. I'm gonna miss\\
154 - your friendly face every morning\\
155 - when I'm getting the paper.\\
156 - Every morning?!\\
157 - Our schedules synch up\\
158 - when I'm doing my power walk.\\
159 - Power walk?\\
160 - What are you smiling about?\\
161 - You know what I'm smiling about.\\
162 - Hey! My pipe survived!\\
163 - It's like a miracle.\\
164 - Filthy habit.\\
165 - * Men.\\
166 - Oh, look, look, look-- The Towering Inferno ison.\\
167 - No?\\
168 - Oh! Stephen King's Firestarter.\\
169 - No?\\
170 - All right.\\
171 - (chuckles) How about Blazing Saddles?\\
172 - Too soon?\\
173 - You guys are no fun.\\
174 - I'm gonna call a hooker.\\
175 - Charlie, there's two young boys in the house.\\
176 - Let 'em get their own hookers.\\
177 - Charlie, for God's sake.\\
178 - Don't worry. I'm a responsible uncle.\\
179 - That's nice to know.\\
180 - I promise I'll get a quiet prostitute.\\
181 - Believe it or not,\\
182 - that's a real concession on his part.\\
183 - Now where is my phone?\\
184 - Oh, right, I must've left it in\\
185 - the charred-but-still-very- livable remains of your house,\\
186 - which he burned down.\\
187 - You're gonna go over there now?\\
188 - All my hooker numbers are in that phone.\\
189 - So unless you wanna have sex with me\\
190 - for $1,000 an hour, I need the phone.\\
191 - You don't really think he'd give me $1,000 an hour?\\
192 - If I were you, I'd get the money up front.\\
193 - * Men.\\
194 - Ah... there we are.\\
195 - (to the tune of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"):\\
196 - * A-B-C-D-E-F-G-...\\
197 - * H...\\
198 - Hookers.\\
199 - Hookers, hookers, hookers...\\
200 - Lookin' for a quiet hooker.\\
201 - Ah, there we go: "Silent Betty."\\
202 - Not a lot of coverage in here.\\
203 - Who the hell are you?\\
204 - Who the hell are you?\\
205 - You're right, let's just stay mysterious strangers.\\
206 - This used to be my house, you know.\\
207 - You the ex-husband?\\
208 - Chris MacElroy.\\
209 - Charlie Harper.\\
210 - Alan's brother.\\
211 - I don't usually admit it, but yeah.\\
212 - What are you doing here, Chris?\\
213 - I wanted to see what the damage was\\
214 - and just, you know, sit here.\\
215 - Try and figure out where it all went wrong.\\
216 - What'd you come up with?\\
217 - I probably shouldn't have banged the babysitter.\\
218 - Yeah, that can do it.\\
219 - I did a babysitter once.\\
220 - My mom was furious.\\
221 - Wouldn't drive her home and absolutely refused to pay her.\\
222 - Want a drink?\\
223 - Sure, why not?\\
224 - To babysitters.\\
225 - (chuckles)\\
226 - Is this a private party or can anyone join?\\
227 - Hey, Herb! Come on in.\\
228 - Hey, Chris, long time no see.\\
229 - Likewise. Grab a seat, have a drink.\\
230 - Oh, gee, I don't know.\\
231 - I told Judith I was taking out the garbage.\\
232 - What the heck. I didn't say where I was taking it.\\
233 - So you two guys know each other?\\
234 - Oh, you kidding?\\
235 - Chris is a legend in this neighborhood.\\
236 - What was she, like, 19?\\
237 - Twenty-two.\\
238 - Nevertheless, quite an accomplishment.\\
239 - Hey, is she still babysitting?\\
240 - 'Cause we're looking for somebody,\\
241 - and everybody Judith interviews is fat and ugly.\\
242 - Take it from me, Herb, you're better off with fat and ugly.\\
243 - Oh, I hardly think so.\\
244 - You'd really be willing\\
245 - to risk your marriage over a cute young babysitter?\\
246 - I certainly wouldn't risk it over a fat ugly one.\\
247 - Can't argue with that.\\
248 - * Men.\\
249 - * Men.\\
250 - I made us a snacky snack.\\
251 - (flatly): Swell.\\
252 - We have onion dip and cool ranch.\\
253 - Always good to have a choice of dips.\\
254 - And I chose you.\\
255 - Zing! (chuckles)\\
256 - What are you doing?\\
257 - Just gettin' comfy.\\
258 - Snugglin' up on the world's best pillow.\\
259 - (chuckles) Mmm!\\
260 - (farts)\\
261 - Whoa. That was an accident, right?\\
262 - Sure...\\
263 - let's call it an accident.\\
264 - Hey, can you take me back to Mom's? Why?\\
265 - Eldridge is being a tool.\\
266 - Whoa!\\
267 - Dad!\\
268 - It wasn't me, it was...\\
269 - Yeah, I'll take you back to your mom's.\\
270 - Hey, Alan?\\
271 - What?\\
272 - Try not to burn down her house.\\
273 - Yeah, ha-ha.\\
274 - You might want to light some matches while I'm gone.\\
275 - * Men.\\
276 - So, Chris, what're you up to these days?\\
277 - Not a lot. After Lyndsey threw me out,\\
278 - I lost my job, started drinking heavily\\
279 - and I just found out I have a lump on my groin.\\
280 - Bad place for a lump.\\
281 - Tell me a good place.\\
282 - Somebody else's groin.\\
283 - Touch  .\\
284 - Boy, you make one mistake\\
285 - and you pay for it for the rest of your life.\\
286 - You only did the babysitter once?\\
287 - Oh, no, that was two years, morning, noon and night,\\
288 - but I count it as one mistake.\\
289 - Maybe that's where he got the lump.\\
290 - (knocking)\\
291 - Did somebody order a pizza?\\
292 - Hey, it's my favorite pizza boy!\\
293 - I'm 38 years old, Mr. Harper.\\
294 - I have high blood pressure and alimony payments.\\
295 - You got a lump on your groin? No.\\
296 - Then don't complain.\\
297 - So what are you people doing here?\\
298 - Having a lonely drink in memory of our hopes and dreams\\
299 - that are now dead and buried.\\
300 - Oh.\\
301 - I'm in.\\
302 - * Men.\\
303 - If it's all the same to you,\\
304 - I'm gonna stay with Mom for a little while.\\
305 - (sighs) Come on, Jake,\\
306 - I know it's been a little rocky lately,\\
307 - but things'll work out.\\
308 - Yeah, well, when they do, call me.\\
309 - Hey, Mom. What are you doing here?\\
310 - What is he he doing here?\\
311 - He wasn't getting along with Lyndsey's son.\\
312 - Maybe that's because\\
313 - Lyndsey's son is a degenerate pothead.\\
314 - He's not so bad.\\
315 - He just made some bad choices.\\
316 - So did his mom.\\
317 - Yeah, well, you made the same bad choice she did!\\
318 - Ha-ha!\\
319 - (men laughing in distance)\\
320 - So Alan's, like, I don't know, five, six years old,\\
321 - and I walk in his bedroom and he's in there with the dog,\\
322 - and I start yelling, "Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no!\\
323 - Are you crazy?! Stop that!"\\
324 - Looks up at me and says "What?"\\
325 - I say, "Alan, the dog is supposed\\
326 - to lick the peanut butter off you."\\
327 - (all laugh)\\
328 - To this day, I can't eat peanut butter.\\
329 - Hello?\\
330 - Hey, we were just talking about you.\\
331 - All good, I hope.\\
332 - Oh, yeah, it was good.\\
333 - (all laugh)\\
334 - So, what's going on?\\
335 - Just having a drink\\
336 - with a few friends.\\
337 - Chris, I believe you know my brother.\\
338 - The man who's banging your wife and burned down your house.\\
339 - Hi.\\
340 - Pull up a chair. Have a drink\\
341 - with your girlfriend's ex and your wife's new husband.\\
342 - I just brought the pizza.\\
343 - I don't think I've slept with anyone you know.\\
344 - Okay.\\
345 - Hey, you know what I just realized?\\
346 - You three guys have all slept with each other.\\
347 - What? What? With all due respect, Charlie,\\
348 - I think I'd remember that.\\
349 - No, no, think about it.\\
350 - They say that when you have sex with someone,\\
351 - you're basically having sex with everyone\\
352 - they've ever had sex with.\\
353 - Oh. I guess you and I have done the dirty deed.\\
354 - Because of Judith, not the peanut butter dog.\\
355 - You told them?!\\
356 - I tell everybody.\\
357 - Wait.\\
358 - So Herb has slept with Alan,\\
359 - and Alan has slept with Chris, which means that...\\
360 - I've slept with Lyndsey!\\
361 - (chuckles) Yes!\\
362 - * Men.\\
363 - (farts)\\
364 - (phone rings)\\
365 - Hello?\\
366 - How could you sleep with Herb?\\
367 - Alan, is that you?\\
368 - Who's Herb? Where are you?\\
369 - I'm in our house.\\
370 - What are you doing there?\\
371 - Because there's nowhere else\\
372 - for me to go 'cause you won't forgive me.\\
373 - Why won't you forgive me?\\
374 - You're drunk.\\
375 - Yeah, well, you farted at me.\\
376 - Good-bye, Alan.\\
377 - Where's Jake?\\
378 - He left hours ago, to get away from you.\\
379 - Where's Alan?\\
380 - He left to get away from me.\\
381 - Where's what's-his-name?\\
382 - The guy who owns the house?\\
383 - He left to get away from all of us.\\
384 - Hey, this is working out pretty good, huh?\\
385 - You know, I envy you guys.\\
386 - You've all been married, have kids.\\
387 - Yeah, it didn't end well,\\
388 - but for a moment in time, each and every one of you experienced\\
389 - what it is to have a family,\\
390 - to give and receive unconditional love.\\
391 - My marriage isn't over.\\
392 - Dude, you've been taking out the garbage\\
393 - for two-and-a-half hours.\\
394 - I said it wasn't over, I didn't say it was good.\\
395 - Really, Charlie, you envy us?\\
396 - Oh, come on, look at me.\\
397 - What do I have?\\
398 - A big house on the beach,\\
399 - more money than I know what to do with...\\
400 - and a cell phone full of candid video of me\\
401 - having uninhibited sex with beautiful women\\
402 - whose names I don't remember.\\
403 - (chuckles)\\
404 - (quietly): I don't think he envies us at all.\\
405 - Good catch, Herb.\\
406 - I gotta go pee.\\
407 - Oh, uh, bathroom's right back there.\\
408 - I know where it is! I used to live here.\\
409 - Right, right.\\
410 - That's a classy guy.\\
411 - Using the toilet in a house with no plumbing.\\
412 - Where have you been going?\\
413 - Refrigerator.\\
414 - I filled the vegetable crisper.\\
415 - See? That's what I love about you, Charlie.\\
416 - You're a maverick.\\
417 - I gotta start being more mavericky-ky.\\
418 - JUDITH: Herb, where the hell are you?!\\
419 - Maybe tomorrow.\\
420 - Hey, Lyndsey, you'll never guess\\
421 - what we figured out about you and me.\\
422 - JUDITH: Herb! See ya soon.\\
423 - Alan, let's go home.\\
424 - You came to get me?\\
425 - Yeah.\\
426 - You forgive me?\\
427 - Well, I thought about it and...\\
428 - Hey, Lyndsey.\\
429 - Chris.\\
430 - What are you doing here?\\
431 - Well, I came to see the damage\\
432 - and I just started thinking about us;\\
433 - what an idiot I was.\\
434 - You were, you know?\\
435 - I'd give anything to start over.\\
436 - Really?\\
437 - Uh, excuse me, but weren't you about to forgive me?\\
438 - Can we go out someplace\\
439 - and have a cup of coffee and maybe,\\
440 - I don't know, just talk?\\
441 - (coughs): Babysitter.\\
442 - Well, I guess\\
443 - there's nothing wrong with talking.\\
444 - That's great.\\
445 - I can't tell you how much I've missed you and Eldridge.\\
446 - He really needs a father, Chris.\\
447 - Uh, so I'll see you back at the house, right?\\
448 - She left her kid there; she's gotta come back.\\
449 - Would you come back for that kid?\\
450 - She's never coming back.\\
451 - (muttering)\\
452 - * Men.\\
453 - * Men.\\
454 - You know who you remind me of, Alan?\\
455 - Job.\\
456 - Job from the Bible?\\
457 - How many Jobs you know?\\
458 - Job-- the guy God punishes just for laughs.\\
459 - Mm! God punishes Job to test his faith.\\
460 - Still funny.\\
461 - (grunts)\\
462 - What time is it?\\
463 - A little after midnight.\\
464 - (groans)\\
465 - So much for that 30-minute guarantee.\\
466 - Good night, fellas.\\
467 - Good night, Gordon.\\
468 - Night, Gordon.\\
469 - So...\\
470 - Guess it's just you and me, huh?\\
471 - Two guys sitting alone in a burned-out house.\\
472 - (knocking)\\
473 - Hey!\\
474 - Silent Betty! You made it!\\
475 - See ya, Alan.\\
476 - Well, sure, half and half sounds good.\\
477 - Huh.\\
478 - Maybe I am like Job.\\
479 - But I am not gonna lose my faith!\\
480 - (thunder crashes)\\
481 - Aw, crap.

1 - * Men.\\
2 - All righty. Here we go.\\
3 - $38.41 for school pictures.\\
4 - Thanks.\\
5 - You forgot to sign it.\\
6 - No. Did I?\\
7 - Oh! Silly me.\\
8 - Um. Alan... Jerome... Harper...\\
9 - D.C.\\
10 - District of Columbia?\\
11 - Doctor of Chiropractic.\\
12 - You know, not everyone can use those letters after his name.\\
13 - Congratulations. Give me the check.\\
14 - You put the wrong date.\\
15 - Oh. Did I?\\
16 - Yeah, see? It's for next month?\\
17 - Oh! Uh, don't worry about that,\\
18 - that's just for bookkeeping purposes.\\
19 - This isn't going to be like the check you gave me\\
20 - for the field trip to Catalina, is it?\\
21 - Hey, hey, that was the bank's mistake.\\
22 - Yeah? Well, the teacher made me stay on the boat\\
23 - while everyone else went swimming with dolphins.\\
24 - Dolphins carry disease, Jake.\\
25 - Alan Harper, D.I.C.\\
26 - You're welcome!\\
27 - JAKE: You're cheap.\\
28 - I'm not cheap, I'm broke!\\
29 - ALAN: There's a difference.\\
30 - He was cheap long before he was broke.\\
31 - If you knew what I'd done on that table recently,\\
32 - you wouldn't put your face on it.\\
33 - I don't get it, Charlie.\\
34 - I'm a good guy, I try to do the right thing,\\
35 - and I have nothing to show for it.\\
36 - Are you still grinding on the fact that you\\
37 - finally met a great gal,\\
38 - moved in with her,\\
39 - had a house you could call your own,\\
40 - then burned it down along with all your possessions\\
41 - and watched her run off with her ex-husband?\\
42 - Was it really necessary to list the entire fiasco?\\
43 - I enjoy the occasional recap.\\
44 - But look at the bright side.\\
45 - What bright side?\\
46 - I just got a big residual check,\\
47 - and I'm heading to Vegas!\\
48 - Oh, my God!\\
49 - Do you have any idea how long it would take me\\
50 - to earn that kind of money?\\
51 - Oh, don't think like that.\\
52 - You're never going to earn that kind of money.\\
53 - (groans)\\
54 - Seriously-- table.\\
55 - (groans): Oh...!\\
56 - Okay, I know I give you a hard time,\\
57 - but it makes me feel horrible watching you go through this.\\
58 - You know what I'm going to do?\\
59 - What?\\
60 - Stop watching you.\\
61 - I'm starting to feel better already.\\
62 - CHARLIE: Table!\\
63 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
64 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
65 - * Men.\\
66 - Okay, I'm out of here.\\
67 - Bye.\\
68 - Oh, Zippy.\\
69 - I can't stand seeing you like this.\\
70 - You going to Vegas, too?\\
71 - I wish.\\
72 - You know, I've been where you are.\\
73 - What'd you do on the table?\\
74 - No... I've been down and out.\\
75 - I've lost everything,\\
76 - didn't know where my next meal was coming from.\\
77 - Really?\\
78 - Felt like I was all alone in the world.\\
79 - No friends.\\
80 - Nobody who gave a damn whether I lived or died.\\
81 - What'd you do?\\
82 - Well, first thing I did was pick myself up,\\
83 - dust myself off, and rat out my ex-boyfriend to the Feds.\\
84 - You're kidding.\\
85 - Got a $2,500 reward from\\
86 - the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.\\
87 - Took that, and invested it in a pallet of\\
88 - counterfeit Jordache jeans,\\
89 - set up a booth at the Rose Bowl swap meet.\\
90 - Made a killing.\\
91 - Really?\\
92 - Took those profits and opened up\\
93 - a little donut shop, across the street\\
94 - from a police station...\\
95 - Can't miss, right?\\
96 - Turns out, cops don't like paying for donuts.\\
97 - Lost my ass.\\
98 - Had to go to work cleaning toilets for strangers.\\
99 - What's the point of this story?\\
100 - I just wanted you to know I've had a colorful past.\\
101 - Good night.\\
102 - (groans)\\
103 - It was a hell of a story.\\
104 - * Men.\\
105 - Jake, I'm going to take a nap.\\
106 - (groans)\\
107 - (groans)\\
108 - (thud, grunt)\\
109 - Ow.\\
110 - Oh...\\
111 - Egyptian cotton.\\
112 - (hums "Streets of Cairo")\\
113 - Might as well take a nap in style for a change.\\
114 - Oh, yeah.\\
115 - No wonder he can have so much sex.\\
116 - The mattress does half the work.\\
117 - Oh, hello.\\
118 - New TV.\\
119 - Hmm, remote.\\
120 - Remote, where is the remote?\\
121 - Poor Charlie.\\
122 - Went to Vegas and forgot his hooker money.\\
123 - Oh, here we go.\\
124 - What the hell?\\
125 - You sick bastard.\\
126 - Oh...\\
127 - This would be terrific with a woman.\\
128 - Ugh.\\
129 - My ass cannot be that big.\\
130 - Ugh...\\
131 - Who's your daddy?\\
132 - Who's your daddy?\\
133 - Unfortunately, you are.\\
134 - Hey, buddy.\\
135 - Uh, what are you doing up here?\\
136 - You're on the TV downstairs.\\
137 - Yes, well, there's a very good explanation for that.\\
138 - I'm listening.\\
139 - It never happened.\\
140 - Understood. Daddy.\\
141 - * Men.\\
142 - Yeah, hi, this is Charlie Harper in the garden suite.\\
143 - I'm going to need a couple more pillows and some ice.\\
144 - Thank you.\\
145 - Okay, this is nice...\\
146 - quiet... private...\\
147 - (knocking on door)\\
148 - Come on in.\\
149 - Mr. Harper?\\
150 - Call me Charlie.\\
151 - All right, Charlie.\\
152 - Call me Kendra.\\
153 - Can I call you Nurse Kendra?\\
154 - If you like.\\
155 - Ooh, I like.\\
156 - I gotta tell you, Nurse Kendra, I'm a little nervous.\\
157 - I've never done anything like this before.\\
158 - Oh! A newbie. Well, don't worry.\\
159 - You're in good hands.\\
160 - Is it going to hurt?\\
161 - Maybe a little soreness afterwards... some bruising...\\
162 - Well, I guess that's what I'm paying for, right?\\
163 - Hello, Mr. Harper!\\
164 - Welcome to the Schenkman Clinic.\\
165 - We have you down for an eye lift and a neck tuck in the morning.\\
166 - That's correct.\\
167 - Is there anything else you'd like done\\
168 - while you're out?\\
169 - Little lipo? Nose job?\\
170 - Penis enlargement?\\
171 - No, no. No, thanks.\\
172 - And for the record,\\
173 - I got a penis enlargement when you walked in the room.\\
174 - Thank you.\\
175 - You have any questions? Concerns?\\
176 - I don't think so, I just want to make sure I look natural,\\
177 - like I haven't had any work done.\\
178 - No. Don't you worry.\\
179 - My work is undetectable.\\
180 - In fact, you might be surprised to learn that Kendra here\\
181 - is a 62-year-old black man.\\
182 - I'm kidding.\\
183 - But those boobs? Those are Schenkman's.\\
184 - I'm not sure I want my eyes to pop out like that.\\
185 - You're going to look great. See you in the morning.\\
186 - Thank you, Doc.\\
187 - Anything else you need?\\
188 - I think I'm okay.\\
189 - Wait, wait, wait.\\
190 - There is one thing.\\
191 - No, you can't see them.\\
192 - Then I'm good.\\
193 - * Men.\\
194 - (doorbell rings)\\
195 - ALAN: Jake! Your mom's here!\\
196 - Hey.\\
197 - Well, I guess it was probably inevitable.\\
198 - What? Oh!\\
199 - Oh, the clothes.\\
200 - Well, as you know, most of mine burned up in the fire,\\
201 - and Charlie's in Vegas, so I figured, why not?\\
202 - Because you look like an idiot.\\
203 - Hey, Mom.\\
204 - Hi. Bye, buddy.\\
205 - Get help.\\
206 - Wish I could afford it!\\
207 - Oh, man.\\
208 - My life is pathetic.\\
209 - On the other hand...\\
210 - Charlie's life is great.\\
211 - Bartender!\\
212 - Drinks for everybody!\\
213 - (everyone cheering)\\
214 - Just house brands.\\
215 - Hi. Charlie Harper.\\
216 - * Men.\\
217 - * Men.\\
218 - Wow! A house on the beach.\\
219 - That's awesome, Charlie.\\
220 - Well, I suppose it must seem that way.\\
221 - I mean, you'd think driving around town\\
222 - in a big, brand-new Mercedes\\
223 - would also be pretty awesome.\\
224 - And-- and it is.\\
225 - Um, but, at the end of the day,\\
226 - doesn't matter how much stuff you have.\\
227 - What matters is what's in here.\\
228 - Oh, what is in here?\\
229 - Oh! Pfft! More cash.\\
230 - How about that?\\
231 - And you got all that just by writing jingles?\\
232 - I know! Not even a real job.\\
233 - What can I say? You know, some of us are very lucky.\\
234 - Very, very... very lucky.\\
235 - Charlie?\\
236 - Yeah. Charlie.\\
237 - I mean, yeah! Charlie!\\
238 - You want to get out of here?\\
239 - Wow! Where'd that come from?\\
240 - I thought we were getting along.\\
241 - N-No!\\
242 - I mean together.\\
243 - Someplace quiet?\\
244 - Oh, yes, uh, yes, by all means!\\
245 - Let's go somewhere quiet.\\
246 - Uh, bartender, thank you for taking such good care of us.\\
247 - Here you go.\\
248 - One, two, three dollars.\\
249 - Give one of those to the waitress.\\
250 - So, where would you like to go?\\
251 - How about your beach house?\\
252 - Great idea!\\
253 - Yeah, why go to Denny's or Appleby's\\
254 - when you have your own beach house?\\
255 - Come, let us Mercedes to the beach.\\
256 - (whispering): This is so easy.\\
257 - * Men.\\
258 - Charlie...\\
259 - Mom?\\
260 - Sweet Jesus!\\
261 - Surprise!\\
262 - What happened to you?\\
263 - What are you doing here?\\
264 - Since I referred you to Dr. Schenkman, he was kind enough\\
265 - to offer me a free chemical peel.\\
266 - When this heals, I will have the face of a 12-year-old girl.\\
267 - Yeah, but from the neck down,\\
268 - you'll still be an Egyptian mummy.\\
269 - Oh, hush.\\
270 - I just stopped by to wish you luck tomorrow.\\
271 - Well, thanks.\\
272 - No, wait-- why would I need luck?\\
273 - Oh, no reason.\\
274 - That 60 Minutes report on Dr. Schenkman\\
275 - was entirely one-sided.\\
276 - Much like that poor woman's vagina.\\
277 - Sleep well.\\
278 - Yeah, like I'm going to sleep at all after that.\\
279 - * Men.\\
280 - Welcome to the Casa del Charlie.\\
281 - Wow.\\
282 - What a beautiful beach house.\\
283 - Yes, yes, it is.\\
284 - Beach is out there.\\
285 - And just past it, the ocean.\\
286 - Oh.\\
287 - Keep going and you hit Hawaii.\\
288 - Oh.\\
289 - Then Japan.\\
290 - And I guess this is where you write all your jingles.\\
291 - Yup. This is where the magic happens.\\
292 - (chuckling)\\
293 - Play me something.\\
294 - Oh, gosh.\\
295 - I'd rather not.\\
296 - Oh, please? For me.\\
297 - Well, if you insist.\\
298 - (anxious laugh)\\
299 - (plays glissando)\\
300 - Ah...\\
301 - Here is a little song you might remember by...\\
302 - ...the immortal...\\
303 - ...Mr. Billy Joel.\\
304 - (off-key): * Harry Truman, Doris Day\\
305 - * Red China, Johnnie Ray\\

313 - * It was always burning since the world's been turning *\\
314 - * We didn't start the fire\\
315 - * No, we didn't light it, but we tried to fight it *\\
316 - * We didn't start the fire!\\
317 - (plays glissando)\\
318 - (laughing)\\
319 - You're very talented.\\
320 - Oh, no, no, no.\\
321 - Billy Joel is very talented.\\
322 - I'm just a piano man.\\
323 - I only have one question. What's that?\\
324 - How long are you going to pretend to be Charlie Harper?\\
325 - (off-key): * Sing us a song\\
326 - * You're the piano man...\\
327 - Oh, please... yeah, give it a rest.\\
328 - (sighs)\\
329 - How'd you know?\\
330 - I've been with Charlie.\\
331 - I-I've been in this house.\\
332 - Well...\\
333 - Color me embarrassed.\\
334 - So...\\
335 - Who are you?\\
336 - (sighs)\\
337 - All right. All right.\\
338 - Here's the truth.\\
339 - My real name is Derek.\\
340 - Brick.\\
341 - House.\\
342 - Derek Brickhouse.\\
343 - Yeah, try again.\\
344 - (sighs) All right.\\
345 - My name is Alan. I'm-I'm Charlie's brother.\\
346 - I-I live on his fold-out couch.\\
347 - I'm-I'm sorry. I'll drive you back.\\
348 - Hang on.\\
349 - I didn't say I wanted to go.\\
350 - Oh, no, but I thought it was kind of implied.\\
351 - I'm having a good time, aren't you?\\
352 - Well, not now.\\
353 - I was.\\
354 - When I was Charlie.\\
355 - And Billy Joel.\\
356 - Who else do you like to be?\\
357 - What do you mean?\\
358 - I think role-playing is kind of a turn-on.\\
359 - No kidding.\\
360 - Yeah.\\
361 - That's why I came back here with you.\\
362 - Makes some guys nervous.\\
363 - Your brother hated it.\\
364 - Well, I am not my brother.\\
365 - (laughing)\\
366 - As you so adroitly pointed out.\\
367 - Come on.\\
368 - Oh, boy.\\
369 - Role playing.\\
370 - Can I be the man?\\
371 - Are you serious?\\
372 - Well, I've had a bad run lately.\\
373 - * Men.\\
374 - Mr. Harper.\\
375 - Mr. Harper.\\
376 - How are you feeling?\\
377 - Okay.\\
378 - How'd it go?\\
379 - It went great.\\
380 - And the doctor decided to give you a bonus.\\
381 - Check 'em out.\\
382 - Oh, no, no.\\
383 - I didn't ask for these.\\
384 - But you haven't even seen them yet.\\
385 - I don't want to see them.\\
386 - Hang on.\\
387 - You know, this could work.\\
388 - * Men.\\
389 - So, Gretchen, what exactly was the role playing\\
390 - that freaked Charlie out so much?\\
391 - GRETCHEN: Hang on. You'll see.\\
392 - I'm just glad you're not as uptight as he is.\\
393 - Well, as you know, I'm capable of bending the rules\\
394 - and going with the flow.\\
395 - (with German accent): What do you think,\\
396 - Schweinhund?\\
397 - Not a deal-breaker.\\
398 - * Men.\\
399 - * Men.\\
400 - Honey, I'm home.\\
401 - ALAN: In the kitchen.\\
402 - Kids okay?\\
403 - How's the Beaver?\\
404 - Everybody's fine. How's Vegas?\\
405 - You know, the usual.\\
406 - How was your weekend?\\
407 - Pretty good.\\
408 - I met a girl.\\
409 - Did her name happen to be Gretchen?\\
410 - Jawohl.\\
411 - That's indelible marker, you know. I know.\\
412 - Don't worry, it'll come off in a few weeks.\\
413 - That's what I figured.\\
414 - Does she still have her little mustache?\\
415 - You know, down at the Russian front?\\
416 - I wouldn't know what she's got.\\
417 - I was blindfolded and hog-tied.\\
418 - Right, right, right.\\
419 - Why are you wearing sunglasses?\\
420 - No reason.\\
421 - Why don't you take them off?\\
422 - Okay, fine.\\
423 - You might as well know.\\
424 - Bar fight.\\
425 - Oh, no. What happened?\\
426 - Eh, some bikers were giving a stripper a hard time,\\
427 - so I jumped in.\\
428 - You're kidding.\\
429 - You know me.\\
430 - I can't stand to see a naked, high-heeled,\\
431 - glitter-covered, ping-pong-ball-shooting\\
432 - woman in distress.\\
433 - Wow. That-That sounds very brave.\\
434 - Good for you.\\
435 - Thank you.\\
436 - Uh, Charlie?\\
437 - Yeah?\\
438 - Uh, if you're going to go with that story,\\
439 - you might want to ask mom\\
440 - to stop telling people you had your eyes done.\\
441 - Damn.\\
442 - The mummy strikes again.\\
443 - You know, it's actually not a bad look.\\
444 - Shame one guy had to ruin it for everybody.\\
445 - * Men.
\subsection {Episode 06: Twanging Your Magic Clanger}
1 - * Men.\\
2 - Gee, that's too bad, Jake. (TV playing)\\
3 - A sore throat and a runny nose? Aw.\\
4 - Oh, yeah. Yeah, I guess you should\\
5 - stay at your mom's this weekend.\\
6 - Oh! Gesundheit.\\
7 - Yeah. Yeah, feel better.\\
8 - Okay, bye-bye.\\
9 - Jake sick?\\
10 - Nah, he's lying through his teeth.\\
11 - Probably has a party to go to or something.\\
12 - Or a hangover. Hmm.\\
13 - Remember when he wanted to be around us?\\
14 - Remember when we wanted to be around him?\\
15 - Hey, that's my son you're talking about.\\
16 - But point taken.\\
17 - So, you're a free man for the weekend.\\
18 - What are your plans?\\
19 - I don't know. Probably just catch up on my reading,\\
20 - take a walk on the beach,\\
21 - you know, a little "me" time.\\
22 - What about you?\\
23 - Pretty much the same.\\
24 - Except instead of reading and walking,\\
25 - I'm going on a date and hoping to get laid.\\
26 - Now, when you say "date,"\\
27 - do you mean an actual date, or one of your\\
28 - $2,500 "date experiences."\\
29 - If I were paying $2,500,\\
30 - I wouldn't just be hoping to get laid. Hmm!\\
31 - So. You're back in the dating game.\\
32 - How'd you hook up?\\
33 - Was it a "meet cute"?\\
34 - Meet... cute?\\
35 - You know, like, uh, like in the movies.\\
36 - She's carrying groceries, and you bump into her\\
37 - and she spills them and you try to help her\\
38 - pick 'em back up, and you bonk heads, and she's concerned\\
39 - she might have a concussion, so you tell her you're a doctor,\\
40 - and you keep up the ruse until after she's fallen in love\\
41 - with you, at which point you confess\\
42 - that you're not the man she thought you were,\\
43 - and she's furious and never wants to talk to you,\\
44 - but you go to her place of work,\\
45 - and you make a complete fool of yourself\\
46 - by declaring your undying love for her\\
47 - during an important business meeting.\\
48 - Thankfully, the meeting is with Japanese bankers\\
49 - who find you charming.\\
50 - And they give her the big account,\\
51 - after which you scoop her into your arms\\
52 - and ask her to marry you, and you live happily ever after.\\
53 - In Portland.\\
54 - Um... no.\\
55 - She's a dermatologist\\
56 - Oh, well, that's cute, too.\\
57 - So, uh, what's her name? How old is she?\\
58 - Uh, her name's Michelle, and I'm guessing mid-'30s.\\
59 - Ooh! Almost age-appropriate.\\
60 - Oh, say, if I took a picture of a strange wart on my toe,\\
61 - would you show it to her and ask if it's normal?\\
62 - Sure, I'll pull it out over dinner.\\
63 - Come on! She's a dermatologist,\\
64 - and I have a hideous growth on my foot.\\
65 - The hideous growth on your foot is you.\\
66 - You know what, I'll email you a jpeg.\\
67 - You'll know when the moment is right.\\
68 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
69 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\

73 - * Men.\\
74 - Hey, Alan.\\
75 - Listen-- Hey, hey, hey, hey!\\
76 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\\
77 - What are you doing?\\
78 - Nothing.\\
79 - Right. Having a little "me" time.\\
80 - Wasn't little until you came in.\\
81 - What do you want?\\
82 - In case I get lucky and this girl comes back here tonight,\\
83 - I need you to make yourself scarce.\\
84 - No problem.\\
85 - I don't want to see you or your wart.\\
86 - Got it.\\
87 - Good.\\
88 - Oh! Try MalibuPuddingGirls.com.\\
89 - Pudding girls?\\
90 - Trust me.\\
91 - Malibu...\\
92 - pudding girls...\\
93 - com.\\
94 - Oh! Yikes.\\
95 - * Men.\\
96 - Right here?\\
97 - That's great.\\
98 - How's your tush?\\
99 - Fine. How are your boobs?\\
100 - I meant, how is it feeling since I took the mole off?\\
101 - Oh! A little tender, but still functional.\\
102 - That's good.\\
103 - It's not fair, though.\\
104 - What?\\
105 - Well, you've seen mine and I haven't seen yours.\\
106 - That's true, isn't it?\\
107 - We're going to have to figure out a way for you to get even.\\
108 - Okay, show me your ass.\\
109 - You're terrible!\\
110 - How are you at those trivia questions?\\
111 - Well, let's see.\\
112 - "Which TV shows jump-started\\
113 - these movie stars' film careers?"\\
114 - Okay.\\
115 - George Clooney. ER.\\
116 - Nice.\\
117 - Leonardo DiCaprio-- Growing Pains.\\
118 - Oh, I didn't know that.\\
119 - Oh, yeah. The last season.\\
120 - John Travolta.\\
121 - Um...\\
122 - (whispers): Welcome Back, Kotter.\\
123 - Oh. Good memory.\\
124 - How could I forget?\\
125 - It was my favorite show in high school.\\
126 - You mean it was your favorite show\\
127 - set in high school, right?\\
128 - Oh, no, no.\\
129 - In tenth grade I had a giant crush on Travolta.\\
130 - But... wasn't that show on in like the '70s?\\
131 - Yeah.\\
132 - So... you were in high school in the '70's?\\
133 - Uh-huh.\\
134 - Were you like, really, really smart\\
135 - and skipped a bunch of grades?\\
136 - Uh-uh.\\
137 - I'm 47, Charlie.\\
138 - Oh. Okay. I wasn't even thinking about that.\\
139 - Really. What were you thinking about?\\
140 - Uh... You know, the whole Scientology thing\\
141 - with Travolta and Cruise. What's that all about?\\
142 - How old are you? You know how old I am.\\
143 - I filled it out on my medical form.\\
144 - Oh, you are not 36, Charlie.\\
145 - Even your mole was older than that.\\
146 - Did I write 36?\\
147 - Yeah.\\
148 - I meant 40...\\
149 - two.\\
150 - Three.\\
151 - So I'm out with a younger man.\\
152 - Sexy.\\
153 - Yeah. Cool.\\
154 - * Men.\\
155 - Do you want to come in for some coffee?\\
156 - Oh, gee, I'd love to, but, um...\\
157 - But what?\\
158 - Well, this isn't something I normally say on a first date,\\
159 - but my left ass cheek is throbbing.\\
160 - Oh, you poor baby. Do you want me to take a look at it?\\
161 - No, no, that'd just be a pity peek.\\
162 - I'm-I'm-I'm sure it's fine.\\
163 - But I-- I should go.\\
164 - Okay.\\
165 - Well, I suppose you'll call me,\\
166 - if you want to get together again.\\
167 - Absolutely, I will.\\
168 - Good night.\\
169 - Good night.\\
170 - You've got my number, right?\\
171 - Indeed, I do.\\
172 - Forty-seven.\\
173 - * Men.\\
174 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!\\
175 - Whoa!\\
176 - Oh, Alan, again?\\
177 - I-It's not what it looks like.\\
178 - Hey, I get it.\\
179 - You're bored. You're lonely. You can't afford a hooker.\\
180 - But come on, keep it in your room!\\
181 - Okay, i-in my defense, I wasn't expecting you home till later.\\
182 - Plus, it felt a little naughtier out here.\\
183 - You know, in public.\\
184 - You want naughty?\\
185 - Go yank it on the pitcher's mound at Dodger Stadium.\\
186 - Ooh, clever.\\
187 - Seventh-inning stretch.\\
188 - You realize I now have to burn the couch.\\
189 - Well, if you're going to do that,\\
190 - you might want to burn the deck chair, too.\\
191 - Oh, God, Alan.\\
192 - So how was your evening?\\
193 - Fine.\\
194 - I thought you were planning on bringing her back here.\\
195 - And yet you were twanging your magic clanger\\
196 - right in the middle of the living room.\\
197 - I lost track of time. Sue me.\\
198 - So, uh, what went wrong with your date?\\
199 - Nothing went wrong.\\
200 - She's terrific. She's beautiful. She's smart.\\
201 - But...?\\
202 - She's 47.\\
203 - You said she was in her mid-'30s.\\
204 - That's what I thought.\\
205 - Apparently, dermatologists\\
206 - know how to take really good care of their skin.\\
207 - Or she's a witch.\\
208 - I don't understand. You liked her when you thought she was 35.\\
209 - What changed?\\
210 - I found out she's 47.\\
211 - Oh, come on. 47's just a number.\\
212 - A big number.\\
213 - A scary number.\\
214 - Are you really that superficial, vain, and shallow?\\
215 - Yes, yes, and yes.\\
216 - Probably the deepest thing about me is a little pit on my ass\\
217 - where a mole used to be.\\
218 - But fish can swim in shallow water.\\
219 - What the hell's that supposed to mean?\\
220 - I don't know, I'm a little dehydrated.\\
221 - What I'm trying to say\\
222 - is that it's silly to throw away a promising relationship\\
223 - based on an arbitrary number.\\
224 - It's not arbitrary. She's really 47.\\
225 - 47! That's like ten years older than me.\\
226 - Why do you do that?\\
227 - I'm your brother.\\
228 - I know exactly how old you are.\\
229 - The point is, the minute I found out she was older than me,\\
230 - I started looking at her in a whole different way.\\
231 - And what way is that?\\
232 - Like, she's a woman who,\\
233 - when I'm 52, she'll be 60.\\
234 - You'll be 56.\\
235 - What are you, the math police?\\
236 - You know what this is really about, don't you?\\
237 - Yeah. When I'm 58, she'll be 70!\\
238 - You're really going to keep doing this?\\
239 - I can't help myself.\\
240 - Look at it this way:\\
241 - When she's 70, you're likely to have been dead for ten years.\\
242 - Actually, that does make me feel a little better.\\
243 - I'll tell you one thing, Charlie.\\
244 - I would give anything to find someone I enjoy being with,\\
245 - who's close to my own age,\\
246 - and who I can really connect with.\\
247 - Look no further, Alan.\\
248 - You've found her.\\
249 - You do get me, don't you?\\
250 - * Men.\\
251 - I gotta be honest with you.\\
252 - I didn't think I was ever going to hear from you again.\\
253 - Why would you think that?\\
254 - I don't know-- the age thing.\\
255 - Oh, come on. It's just a number.\\
256 - I like you.\\
257 - I'm attracted to you.\\
258 - Plus, there's no way anybody looks at you and thinks,\\
259 - "This is a 47-year-old woman."\\
260 - Thank you.\\
261 - Hey, we're only as old as we feel, right?\\
262 - Right.\\
263 - So I say, for all intents and purposes, you and I?\\
264 - Couple of 35-year-olds.\\
265 - Agreed. We're 35.\\
266 - Hi, Mom.\\
267 - That's my daughter.\\
268 - For all intents and purposes, she's eight.\\
269 - * Men.\\
270 - * Men.\\
271 - Shauna, this is Charlie.\\
272 - SHAUNA: Yeah, hey. Sorry to interrupt.\\
273 - I just came to pick up my snowboard stuff.\\
274 - Why?\\
275 - What do you mean, why?\\
276 - I'm going to Mammoth for a few days.\\
277 - With who?\\
278 - What do you care?\\
279 - I'm your mother.\\
280 - Should I go?\\
281 - No, no, it's fine.\\
282 - Who are you going with?\\
283 - His name's Jeremy.\\
284 - You happy?\\
285 - Jeremy? What happened to Sarah?\\
286 - Sarah and I broke up.\\
287 - (mouthing)\\
288 - MICHELLE: When were you gonna tell me this?\\
289 - Mom, I'm 20 years old;\\
290 - my personal life is none of your business.\\
291 - (mouthing)\\
292 - As long as you're my daughter, it's my business.\\
293 - Tell me about Jeremy.\\
294 - What's to tell?\\
295 - He's a nice guy.\\
296 - He's Sarah's roommate.\\
297 - Wait a minute.\\
298 - You broke up with Sarah\\
299 - so you could hook up with her roommate?\\
300 - No, no.\\
301 - We were all hooking up together, but then Sarah got all weird\\
302 - even though it was her idea.\\
303 - Don't you just hate that?\\
304 - Are you telling me that the three of you had sex together?\\
305 - Hey, you're the one who said\\
306 - I should explore all my options in life.\\
307 - I was talking about grad school, not threesomes!\\
308 - I'm so sorry you have to hear this.\\
309 - No, no, no, it's fine.\\
310 - Pretend I'm not here.\\
311 - I also need to borrow some money.\\
312 - Shauna, how do you expect to pay me back?\\
313 - I still have a job.\\
314 - A webcam in your bathroom\\
315 - and a PayPal account is not a job!\\
316 - (groans weakly)\\
317 - I admit, it's not making much money.\\
318 - But that's because there's so much free porn out there!\\
319 - She's got a point.\\
320 - The whole pay-to-peek industry is dying.\\
321 - Thank you. You're welcome.\\
322 - And if I could just throw in my two cents here.\\
323 - Michelle, your daughter's at that time\\
324 - in her life where she's got to make her own choices,\\
325 - and it doesn't matter if they're right or wrong.\\
326 - Either way, she learns.\\
327 - But I'm just trying to protect her.\\
328 - You can't protect her.\\
329 - All you can do is love her and be there for her no matter what.\\
330 - I am there for her.\\
331 - You know that, right?\\
332 - Yeah, I do.\\
333 - Come here.\\
334 - (groans weakly)\\
335 - What?\\
336 - I should go.\\
337 - Oh, no, no, it's okay.\\
338 - Really, I got to go. And you should have\\
339 - this time with your daughter.\\
340 - Are you sure?\\
341 - Absolutely.\\
342 - I'll call you tomorrow. Nice to meet you, Shauna.\\
343 - Nice to meet you, too.\\
344 - It's wrong, it's wrong, it's so wrong.\\
345 - Oh, what the hell?\\
346 - Let's try ShaunaShower.com.\\
347 - * Men.\\
348 - (mariachi music playing)\\
349 - Oh, for God's sake! Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa!\\
350 - Whoa, whoa, whoa!\\
351 - It's not what it looks like!\\
352 - Well, that's a relief.\\
353 - 'Cause it looks like you were masturbating\\
354 - to mariachi music in your car.\\
355 - What do you want?\\
356 - I only get AM radio!\\
357 - * Men.\\
358 - CHARLIE: Alan?\\
359 - In here. (TV playing)\\
360 - Is it safe?\\
361 - Yes.\\
362 - We cool here?\\
363 - Yes.\\
364 - Relax.\\
365 - You do realize you have a serious problem.\\
366 - It's not my fault.\\
367 - Really?\\
368 - Whose fault is it?\\
369 - Big pharma.\\
370 - (turns off TV)\\
371 - Who the hell's big pharma?\\
372 - You know, the pharmaceutical companies\\
373 - that make boner pills that last 36 hours.\\
374 - You took a boner pill?\\
375 - I had to. The pills were about to expire.\\
376 - But you didn't have a woman.\\
377 - Hence the constant masturbation.\\
378 - You know how expensive those things are.\\
379 - I'm simply trying to get my money's worth.\\
380 - So this non-stop whack-a-thon is just 'cause you're cheap?\\
381 - And horny.\\
382 - And nuts.\\
383 - Semantics.\\
384 - Why the car?\\
385 - You said "not in the living room."\\
386 - Did I say "in the car"?\\
387 - Well, I didn't plan it.\\
388 - I was gonna go to the movies and I got distracted.\\
389 - What could possibly distract you from driving out of the garage?\\
390 - Think about it.\\
391 - Slipping the key into the hole.\\
392 - Gently turning it.\\
393 - Pumping the gas until the engine starts purring.\\
394 - I'm thinking about it and I'm still going with nuts.\\
395 - Well, unlike you, I did not have female companionship tonight.\\
396 - Well, as it turns out, neither did I.\\
397 - What happened?\\
398 - You really expect me to share my personal problems\\
399 - with a self-abusing zoo monkey?\\
400 - Who else you got?\\
401 - (sighs)\\
402 - All right, here's the deal.\\
403 - I went back to Michelle,\\
404 - determined to take the whole age thing off the table.\\
405 - Good for you. Very mature.\\
406 - And it was going great, until her daughter walks in.\\
407 - She has a daughter?\\
408 - Not just a daughter, Alan.\\
409 - A 20-year-old daughter.\\
410 - A gorgeous daughter.\\
411 - A bisexual daughter.\\
412 - Summing up:\\
413 - a 20-year-old, gorgeous, bisexual daughter.\\
414 - Got it.\\
415 - What did you do?\\
416 - What could I do? I got the hell out of there.\\
417 - Why?\\
418 - What do you mean, why?\\
419 - You know me.\\
420 - If I continue a relationship with Michelle,\\
421 - at some point, I'm gonna try to nail her daughter.\\
422 - Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,\\
423 - but as sure as your speedometer could use a Handi Wipe,\\
424 - it will happen.\\
425 - So you're breaking up with Michelle?\\
426 - I have to!\\
427 - And then you're gonna hit on the daughter.\\
428 - No, no, no, no.\\
429 - I'm getting away from both of them.\\
430 - I figure it's better to hurt Michelle\\
431 - a little now than a lot later.\\
432 - Oh.\\
433 - Well, color me impressed.\\
434 - You're making a decision\\
435 - that's considerate and selfless.\\
436 - Putting aside, of course, the fact that\\
437 - the motivation for the decision is sordid and despicable.\\
438 - Thank you.\\
439 - Seriously though, the daughter is unbelievable.\\
440 - She actually has some kind of porn site on the Internet.\\
441 - Really?\\
442 - Apparently, there's a webcam in her bathroom.\\
443 - Mm.\\
444 - Can you imagine?\\
445 - A 20-year-old co-ed in the shower with her girlfriend,\\
446 - soaping each other up?\\
447 - Something to ponder.\\
448 - Excuse me.\\
449 - (mariachi music playing)\\
450 - Actually, not a bad idea.\\
451 - * Men.\\
452 - ALAN: Hey, hey, hey, hey!\\
453 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\\
454 - Aw, geez, Zippy!\\
455 - What are you doing with the pudding?\\
456 - * Men.\\
457 - Well, I guess I appreciate your honesty.\\
458 - I just think it wouldn't be fair to start a relationship with you\\
459 - knowing I'm still not over Chelsea.\\
460 - No, it's understandable.\\
461 - She was your fianc  e.\\
462 - I've tried to stop thinking about her, and I can't.\\
463 - And I like you too much to risk our relationship\\
464 - being some kind of a rebound thing.\\
465 - All right.\\
466 - I guess I just have to accept that.\\
467 - Thank you.\\
468 - Bye.\\
469 - Bye.\\
470 - You know what, Jeremy?\\
471 - Just go to hell.\\
472 - You're a childish jerk.\\
473 - Oh, hey.\\
474 - You okay?\\
475 - I guess.\\
476 - Just thought this guy was something he's not.\\
477 - Well, he's young,\\
478 - and, you know, women mature faster than boys.\\
479 - That is so true.\\
480 - Have you considered dating someone a little older?\\
481 - I tried that once; it was disgusting.\\
482 - Really?\\
483 - The guy was almost 35.\\
484 - It was like sleeping with my grandfather.\\
485 - No kidding.\\
486 - He could only do it twice in a row\\
487 - before he needed to take a nap.\\
488 - Uh-huh.\\
489 - Excuse me.\\
490 - Hey, Michelle, good news!\\
491 - I think I'm over Chelsea!\\
492 - * Men.\\
493 - *\\
494 - ALAN: Hey, hey, hey! Whoa, whoa!\\
495 - It's not what it looks like!\\
496 - * Men.\\
497 - So... you feel like going again?\\
498 - Uh, sure.\\
499 - I just need, you know, a little nap first.\\
500 - Geez, Charlie, what are you gonna be like\\
501 - when you're my age?\\
502 - Ooh, ouch.\\
503 - I'm kidding.\\
504 - Come here.\\
505 - (cell phone ringing)\\
506 - Hang on.\\
507 - What do you want, Alan?\\
508 - Arrested?\\
509 - For what?\\
510 - Oh, Alan.\\
511 - What was the movie?\\
512 - You're right, doesn't matter.\\
513 - Okay, I'm on my way.\\
514 - Where you going?\\
515 - Nowhere.\\
516 - (laughs)\\

1 - * Men.\\
2 - Swordfish looks good.\\
3 - You eat a lot of fish.\\
4 - Aren't you worried about mercury?\\
5 - Michelle, on the list of things I expect to kill me,\\
6 - mercury poisoning ranks well below liver failure,\\
7 - struck by lightning and heart attack during sex.\\
8 - Guess which one I'm rooting for.\\
9 - Charles?\\
10 - Speaking of things I expect to kill me.\\
11 - What a lovely surprise.\\
12 - Michelle, this is my mother Evelyn. Mom, Michelle.\\
13 - Evelyn, it's a pleasure. You have a wonderful son.\\
14 - Yes, I do.\\
15 - But Charlie and Alan must never learn of him.\\
16 - Before she kills, she likes to torture.\\
17 - So, how did you two meet?\\
18 - Charlie asked me to look at a little thing on his butt.\\
19 - Oh, smooth, Charlie.\\
20 - She's a dermatologist, Mom.\\
21 - Oh, a doctor?\\
22 - So you have access to Charlie's medical records\\
23 - and still went out with him.\\
24 - Okay, nice to see you, Mom. I don't want to keep you\\
25 - from whatever poor schmuck you're here to meet.\\
26 - Sorry I'm late, Mom.\\
27 - How about that? The poorest schmuck I know.\\
28 - Michelle, this is my brother Alan.\\
29 - Alan, Michelle. Hi.\\
30 - Nice to meet you.\\
31 - Would you like to join us?\\
32 - Sure.\\
33 - How sweet.\\
34 - Uh... waiter?\\
35 - I thought you liked me.\\
36 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
37 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\

42 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
43 - * Men.\\
44 - Well, this is very pleasant.\\
45 - The last time I met one of Charlie's girlfriends,\\
46 - I was picking glitter off my skin for a week.\\
47 - Oh, right, the 22-year-old pole dancer.\\
48 - (grunts)\\
49 - Oh, don't get the wrong idea.\\
50 - I mean, not every woman Charlie dates is a stripper.\\
51 - I can't imagine\\
52 - you stripping, for example.\\
53 - I mean, I can imagine it.\\
54 - (growls)\\
55 - So what's the occasion for you two?\\
56 - No occasion.\\
57 - Can't a son invite his mom to lunch?\\
58 - He needs money.\\
59 - No, no. But if you're lookin' to give some away\\
60 - I'm not gonna turn it down.\\
61 - You're a dermatologist.\\
62 - How do I get rid of a 170-pound skin tag?\\
63 - Excuse me, 164.\\
64 - Really? That's the part you object to?\\
65 - Would you like to be called a 200-pound drunk?\\
66 - 180. See?\\
67 - Yeah, well, better a lush than a leech.\\
68 - At least a leech doesn't miss\\
69 - his mother's birthday in a drunken blackout.\\
70 - Yes, but when the lush wakes up,\\
71 - he can buy her a nice gift with his own money.\\
72 - He can, but he doesn't.\\
73 - He doesn't because\\
74 - you wouldn't appreciate it anyway.\\
75 - Let's not start with appreciation.\\
76 - Did I ever get a thank you\\
77 - for bearing you and raising you all by myself?\\
78 - Thank you, Mommy.\\
79 - Give it a rest.\\
80 - I'll write you a check.\\
81 - Thank you, Mommy.\\
82 - (sighs) Do you have children, Michelle?\\
83 - I have a daughter.\\
84 - Isn't that nice?\\
85 - Has she ripped your heart out yet?\\
86 - Not quite.\\
87 - Well, give her time.\\
88 - Children are God's little way of\\
89 - punishing us for having sex.\\
90 - So, Michelle, you've met my mom and my brother.\\
91 - Will you be breaking up with me now\\
92 - or would you prefer to wait till after lunch?\\
93 - I'll wait.\\
94 - I already ordered the souffle\\
95 - and I understand it's very good here.\\
96 - Oh, she's attractive, successful and funny.\\
97 - So tell me, dear,\\
98 - why are you settling?\\
99 - * Men.\\
100 - Mmm... wait, wait, wait.\\
101 - Can I ask you a question?\\
102 - Sure.\\
103 - Have there been a lot of women in this bed?\\
104 - Uh...\\
105 - actually in the bed?\\
106 - Fewer than you'd think.\\
107 - Charlie...\\
108 - Listen, I'm not gonna lie about who I am\\
109 - or where I've been,\\
110 - so don't ask unless you really want to know.\\
111 - It doesn't matter.\\
112 - The past is the past.\\
113 - Agreed.\\
114 - Let's work on the present.\\
115 - Oh, goody, I love presents.\\
116 - (laughs)\\
117 - (knocking)\\
118 - JAKE: Uncle Charlie?\\
119 - Busy, Jake.\\
120 - JAKE: Oh, is Chelsea back?\\
121 - No, Jake.\\
122 - Mia?\\
123 - No.\\
124 - The married stripper? What's her name, Betsy?\\
125 - What do you need, Jake?\\
126 - Can I borrow your car?\\
127 - No, you can't borrow my hundred- thousand-dollar Mercedes!\\
128 - Okay.\\
129 - Sorry about that.\\
130 - It's not another hooker, is it?\\
131 - Excuse me.\\
132 - Here's the keys. Go away. Thank you.\\
133 - My nephew.\\
134 - Everyone's convinced he's a freaking moron,\\
135 - but I'm starting to think he's an evil genius.\\
136 - * Men.\\
137 - Hey, did you hear that noise last night?\\
138 - What noise?\\
139 - Around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning,\\
140 - I thought I heard a man crying.\\
141 - Oh, that's nothing. That's just Alan.\\
142 - It's nothing?\\
143 - Yeah, he gets up in the middle of the night to pee,\\
144 - then he can't get back to sleep, so he masturbates.\\
145 - Then he starts crying.\\
146 - Oh, my God, that's awful!\\
147 - It's like the ocean. I don't even hear it anymore.\\
148 - Hey, sorry I'm late.\\
149 - I stopped off and did the shopping for the week.\\
150 - Michelle, this is my housekeeper Berta.\\
151 - Berta, Michelle. Hi.\\
152 - Nice to meet you.\\
153 - Planning a party?\\
154 - Every afternoon at 2:00.\\
155 - (chuckles) She's, she's kidding.\\
156 - Right, Berta?\\
157 - Huh? Yeah, sure, why not?\\
158 - Can I go upstairs and make your bed\\
159 - or are you guys just catchin' your breath and rinsin' off?\\
160 - No, it's fine.\\
161 - We're just gonna go for a walk on the beach.\\
162 - (laughs) Good one.\\
163 - Why is that funny?\\
164 - Last time this one was on the beach\\
165 - was 'cause he fell off the deck.\\
166 - It wasn't his fault. He was drunk.\\
167 - I'll go make your bed.\\
168 - She seems... nice.\\
169 - You think?\\
170 - 'Cause she scares the crap outta me.\\
171 - Well, then why don't you get rid of her?\\
172 - Oh, no, no, no, no, I could never fire her.\\
173 - I love her to death.\\
174 - Interesting.\\
175 - So, you love her and yet she scares you?\\
176 - Little window into ol' Charlie, huh?\\
177 - More like a garage door.\\
178 - * Men.\\
179 - Well, you've met my family,\\
180 - you know all about my past,\\
181 - my fondness for... things I'm fond of.\\
182 - Uh-huh?\\
183 - So... why are you still here?\\
184 - Come on, Charlie, I'm a realist.\\
185 - Nobody our age comes without baggage.\\
186 - Well, yeah, but some people might think\\
187 - that my baggage is... extra icky.\\
188 - Extra icky?\\
189 - That's actually a quote from a former girlfriend.\\
190 - Well, I think that a mature relationship has got\\
191 - to be based on honesty about our flaws.\\
192 - You know my flaws.\\
193 - Openness about our past.\\
194 - You know my past.\\
195 - And a willingness to forgive.\\
196 - I forgive you.\\
197 - (chuckles)\\
198 - I really like you, Michelle.\\
199 - I really like you, too.\\
200 - ROSE: Hi, Charlie.\\
201 - There might be one more thing you should know about me.\\
202 - * Men.\\
203 - * Men.\\
204 - Rose, this is not a good time.\\
205 - I just want to talk to you.\\
206 - I'm sorry, Michelle, this'll only take a minute.\\
207 - Do I know you?\\
208 - Nope.\\
209 - Seriously, Rose, not now.\\
210 - How do you know my na...?\\
211 - How does she know my name?\\
212 - Long story. Not really.\\
213 - Once you have a license plate number,\\
214 - the rest is cake.\\
215 - Could you give us a minute?\\
216 - No, she's not goin' anywhere.\\
217 - Charlie, who is this woman?\\
218 - Just a friend.\\
219 - Oh, I'm more than a friend. We dated.\\
220 - Just once. Eight years ago.\\
221 - You haven't seen her in eight years?\\
222 - Well, no, no, no. Not exactly.\\
223 - We stay in touch.\\
224 - You stalk me.\\
225 - Oh, please.\\
226 - Does a stalker baby-sit his nephew?\\
227 - Does a stalker sleep with his brother?\\
228 - Does a stalker's dad sleep with his mother,\\
229 - who you met at lunch the other day at Terrace Gardens?\\
230 - Have you been following me?\\
231 - Not you.\\
232 - Okay Charlie, I'm a little freaked out here.\\
233 - I'm going to go home.\\
234 - What? Why?\\
235 - Nice officially meeting you.\\
236 - Oh, come on, Michelle, don't go.\\
237 - I'll get rid of her.\\
238 - No, no, no. No.\\
239 - Clearly, you have lots to talk about.\\
240 - But what about all that stuff you said?\\
241 - You know, baggage, willingness to forgive?\\
242 - Obviously, I was wrong.\\
243 - Michelle.\\
244 - No, look. I could deal with your mother,\\
245 - your brother, your nephew, your housekeeper...\\
246 - Yeah, I know-- No, no, no. I'm not done.\\
247 - Your drinking, your gambling,\\
248 - your womanizing,\\
249 - but I am not putting up with your stalker.\\
250 - Really? That's where you draw the line?\\
251 - Seems a little arbitrary.\\
252 - Good-bye, Charlie.\\
253 - (door closes)\\
254 - I like her.\\
255 - She's feisty.\\
256 - That's it, Rose.\\
257 - This is the last straw.\\
258 - Really?\\
259 - That's where you draw the line?\\
260 - I really care about this woman.\\
261 - I'm glad for you.\\
262 - No, you're not!\\
263 - You never are. You always do everything you can\\
264 - to come between me and any woman I'm serious about.\\
265 - Is that what you think I'm doing?\\
266 - Of course that's what I think you're doing; you just did it!\\
267 - You've been doing it for eight years,\\
268 - and I'm sick of it.\\
269 - Now, get out.\\
270 - Okay, but you should know that I didn't come over\\
271 - to ruin your date.\\
272 - Really? Why did you come over?\\
273 - To tell you that I'm getting married.\\
274 - I'm not marrying you, Rose.\\
275 - Not you, silly.\\
276 - Manfred.\\
277 - Manfred?\\
278 - He's so wonderful.\\
279 - I can't wait for you to meet him.\\
280 - Uh-huh. Have you met him yet?\\
281 - You don't believe me?\\
282 - Well, of course I don't believe you.\\
283 - All you've ever done is manipulate and deceive me.\\
284 - Mm, fair point.\\
285 - But I am getting married next Sunday,\\
286 - and I just wanted to let you know\\
287 - before you heard it somewhere else.\\
288 - Where else would I hear it?\\
289 - Society page of The Crazy Bitch Gazette?\\
290 - Clearly, it was a mistake coming over.\\
291 - I had no idea the news would hit you this hard.\\
292 - Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm bowled over,\\
293 - I'm devastated, I can't imagine life without you.\\
294 - Good-bye.\\
295 - Last chance to kiss the bride.\\
296 - (knocking)\\
297 - What?\\
298 - I'm not sure how to get home from this side of the house.\\
299 - * Men.\\
300 - Hey, Michelle. It's me again.\\
301 - Sorry for all the messages.\\
302 - Don't worry, I'm not stalking you.\\
303 - (chuckles)\\
304 - Anyway,\\
305 - again, I am really sorry for all the craziness last night,\\
306 - but, like you pointed out, everybody's got baggage.\\
307 - Unfortunately, one piece of mine\\
308 - needs to be sedated and institutionalized.\\
309 - Okay, call me.\\
310 - Kisses. (blows kisses)\\
311 - Kisses?\\
312 - If I was any fruitier, I could open a Jamba Juice.\\
313 - Check it out.\\
314 - Rose's engagement announcement is in the paper.\\
315 - Manfred Quinn?\\
316 - Says he's an important figure in the fashion industry.\\
317 - Eh, I still don't buy it.\\
318 - What do you mean? It's right here in the paper. Oh, grow up.\\
319 - Do you have any idea how many times\\
320 - I had that paper print my obituary?\\
321 - Why would you do that?\\
322 - Lots of reasons.\\
323 - Gambling debts, angry husbands,\\
324 - sometimes just to get a little me time.\\
325 - Well, real or fake, I'm a little miffed I wasn't invited.\\
326 - How do you get invited to a fake wedding, Alan?\\
327 - With a fake invitation.\\
328 - Obviously.\\
329 - How come Rose only shows up when I'm in a good relationship?\\
330 - Where was she when I was dating the manic-depressive Satanist?\\
331 - Or that chick with all the knives?\\
332 - Don't forget the pre-op lifeguard.\\
333 - Post-op. She was post-op.\\
334 - Really? Could've sworn I saw a bulge in that bikini bottom.\\
335 - The point is, it's like...\\
336 - it's like Rose has some kind of sixth sense\\
337 - where she knows when I'm about to be happy.\\
338 - It's not a sixth sense-- she follows you around and watches your every move.\\
339 - For all we know, the house is bugged\\
340 - and she's listening to us right now.\\
341 - Hi, Rose.\\
342 - Yeah, well, if she is...\\
343 - she overplayed her hand this time!\\
344 - And I'm not falling for this wedding crap!\\
345 - But just in case, shouldn't we get her a gift?\\
346 - What?\\
347 - (whispering): They're having a sale at Williams-Sonoma.\\
348 - You want to go halvsies on a silver pepper mill?\\
349 - No, I'm not going halvsies on a silver pepper mill!\\
350 - Okay, then... okay, how about a lovely ceramic\\
351 - cow-shaped creamer, handmade by the Pennsylvania Dutch?\\
352 - No gifts. Why not?\\
353 - 'Cause there's no wedding!\\
354 - There's no wedding!\\
355 - Well, you do what you want, Charlie Harper,\\
356 - but I, Alan Harper, am gonna get Rose something really nice!\\
357 - Ooh, a set of faux-walnut napkin rings, only $9.95.\\
358 - Add to cart.\\
359 - * Men.\\
360 - (sighs)\\
361 - Surprise!\\
362 - Not really-- you called, like, 11 times.\\
363 - These are for you.\\
364 - Thank you.\\
365 - It doesn't change anything.\\
366 - Oh, come on, Michelle,\\
367 - I can't help it if some meaningless one-night stand\\
368 - from years ago is still obsessed with me.\\
369 - It's not about her, Charlie, it's about you.\\
370 - Okay, I can't help it if I'm so wonderful\\
371 - she's still obsessed with me.\\
372 - That's not what I meant.\\
373 - Yeah, I didn't think so.\\
374 - The fact that you still have a relationship with her\\
375 - after all this time tells me that you have real feelings for her.\\
376 - Okay, okay, maybe we have developed\\
377 - some sort of friendship, but that doesn't change the fact\\
378 - that on a very primal level\\
379 - the woman scares the hell out of me.\\
380 - Listen to yourself.\\
381 - That's exactly what you said about your housekeeper.\\
382 - You love her, but you're scared of her.\\
383 - And having met your mother,\\
384 - I'm betting you're scared of her, too.\\
385 - Well, yeah, but I don't love her.\\
386 - Charlie...\\
387 - What are you trying to say, I'm in love with Rose?\\
388 - You tell me.\\
389 - Bye, Charlie.\\
390 - Okay, I do love Berta.\\
391 - I suppose I kind of love my mother.\\
392 - Aw, crap.\\
393 - * Men.\\
394 - So, today's the big day, huh?\\
395 - What big day?\\
396 - Rose's wedding.\\
397 - Oh, please! There's no wedding.\\
398 - You sure about that?\\
399 - Yeah, I'm sure.\\
400 - But what if you're wrong?\\
401 - What do you mean?\\
402 - I mean, would it make a difference to you,\\
403 - knowing that cute little face\\
404 - will never pop up over that railing again?\\
405 - That the one woman who's always loved you\\
406 - and been there for you is forever out of reach?\\
407 - Come on.\\
408 - Where are we going? To the church.\\
409 - I'm gonna prove to you that she's not getting married.\\
410 - Okay.\\
411 - Aren't we a little underdressed?\\
412 - There's no wedding.\\
413 - Last chance to go halvsies on the napkin rings.\\
414 - There's no wedding.\\
415 - Only cost you 50 bucks.\\
416 - * Men.\\
417 - You see? No wedding.\\
418 - You got X-ray vision?\\
419 - (scoffs) Come on, I'll show you.\\
420 - Just a heads up-- if there's no wedding,\\
421 - you're getting napkin rings for Christmas.\\
422 - Go ahead, Alan, look.\\
423 - Tell me if you see a wedding.\\
424 - I see a wedding.\\
425 - What?\\
426 - MINISTER: ...two persons present now come to be joined.\\
427 - Rose and Manfred, we are here to remember...\\
428 - Oh, my God.\\
429 - She's really doing it.\\
430 - Rose is getting married.\\
431 - It's not too late to stop it.\\
432 - (sighs) Don't be ridiculous.\\
433 - It's way too late.\\
434 - Okay, $25 to split the gift-- and I'm losing money.\\
435 - ...why this man and this woman\\
436 - should not be joined in holy matrimony,\\
437 - let him speak now or forever hold his peace.\\
438 - And we're clear.\\
439 - Yep, that ought to do it.\\
440 - Thanks, Freddy.\\
441 - My pleasure.\\
442 - I guess.\\
443 - * Men.\\
444 - Unbelievable.\\
445 - Rose is actually married.\\
446 - (chuckles) Mrs. Manfred Quinn.\\
447 - (big sigh)\\
448 - I see it now.\\
449 - I love her.\\
450 - I've always loved her.\\
451 - I'm sorry.\\
452 - It's true what they say, Alan.\\
453 - You don't know what you got until it's gone.\\
454 - Well... you still got me.\\
455 - You're not who they had in mind when they said it.\\
456 - I'll always love you, Rose.\\
457 - (smacks lips)\\
458 - Mrs. Manny Quinn.

2 - So, I'm confused.\\
3 - Is Edward the gay vampire or the gay werewolf?\\
4 - The vampire.\\
5 - And he's not gay, he's... androgynous.\\
6 - So he can write with both hands, big deal.\\
7 - No, I mean...\\
8 - Never mind.\\
9 - I'll tell you what's a great movie--\\
10 - Jackass 2. (turns off TV)\\
11 - Now, I know what you're thinking: sequels suck.\\
12 - But not that one.\\
13 - There's this one part where this guy\\
14 - puts on a diver's helmet with a hose attached,\\
15 - and this fat guy farts into the tube until he pukes.\\
16 - The guy in the diver's helmet, not the fat guy.\\
17 - Sounds puerile.\\
18 - Oh, yeah, it's totally puerile.\\
19 - Unless puerile isn't good.\\
20 - In which case, it's totally un-puerile.\\
21 - Anti-puerile?\\
22 - Maybe we shouldn't talk.\\
23 - CHARLIE: Hello!\\
24 - (door closes) Oh, crap.\\
25 - Is that your dad?\\
26 - No, worse.\\
27 - My drunken uncle.\\
28 - I just pray he remembered to pull up his zipper.\\
29 - There's my main man.\\
30 - Jake-o-roonie, Jake-o-reenie,\\
31 - Jake the snake!\\
32 - Who are you?\\
33 - Megan.\\
34 - Meg-a-roonie, Meg-a-reenie,\\
35 - Megan the snagan.\\
36 - Zipper, Uncle Charlie.\\
37 - Oop, good catch.\\
38 - Thought you had a date tonight.\\
39 - Not a date, a date experience.\\
40 - What's the difference?\\
41 - About $1,500.\\
42 - So, Megan,\\
43 - what's your deal?\\
44 - Trying to teach your parents a lesson?\\
45 - I'm in Jake's homeroom.\\
46 - Got it. Yeah, I was pretty sure\\
47 - you didn't meet him in honors math class.\\
48 - Boy, I remember being your age.\\
49 - Going out with Beth Anderson.\\
50 - She was head cheerleader.\\
51 - I was crazy about her, but she dumped me\\
52 - and left me with nothing but a broken heart.\\
53 - And the clap.\\
54 - The what?\\
55 - Wow, you kids today have no idea what that is, do you?\\
56 - I know it sounds cute.\\
57 - The clap!\\
58 - But it burns like hell.\\
59 - I think I'd better get home.\\
60 - Wait, don't go.\\
61 - He'll be passed out in ten minutes.\\
62 - I'll see you in homeroom.\\
63 - Come on, Megan.\\
64 - Thanks a lot!\\
65 - You're welcome!\\
66 - I'm really gonna get you back for this.\\
67 - Okey-dokey.\\
68 - Megan, hold up!\\
69 - Oh, Beth Anderson.\\
70 - Every time it hurts when I pee,\\
71 - I think of you.\\
72 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
73 - * Men. * Ooh.\\
74 - * Men.\\
75 - Charlie.\\
76 - (groggily): What?\\
77 - Sign this.\\
78 - I'm not signing anything till I see a lawyer.\\
79 - Wake up!\\
80 - What?\\
81 - Birthday card for Mom.\\
82 - Sign it.\\
83 - No, thanks.\\
84 - Come back with a "do not resuscitate" form\\
85 - and we'll talk.\\
86 - Come on, Charlie.\\
87 - What did we get her?\\
88 - You mean, "What did I get her?"\\
89 - No, I mean, what did I pay for?\\
90 - We went 50-50 on engraved stationery.\\
91 - 50-50?\\
92 - Okay, 100-zero.\\
93 - But I will pay you back.\\
94 - Right.\\
95 - I assume you don't want to go with me and Jake\\
96 - to give her her present and wish her a happy birthday.\\
97 - And I assume you're never gonna pay me back.\\
98 - We are a well-oiled machine.\\
99 - "Mom, you know how I feel.\\
100 - Charlie."\\
101 - Straight from the heart.\\
102 - * Men.\\
103 - This just blows.\\
104 - Come on. (doorbell rings)\\
105 - Seeing you is going to make your grandmother very happy.\\
106 - EVELYN (over speaker): What do you two want?\\
107 - Hi, Mom!\\
108 - Happy birthday!\\
109 - (muttering): Happy birthday.\\
110 - We brought you a gift.\\
111 - EVELYN: Doesn't give you license to show up unannounced,\\
112 - but all right.\\
113 - (lock buzzes)\\
114 - She just better keep me in the will.\\
115 - EVELYN: I can hear you, Jake.\\
116 - Love you, Grandma.\\
117 - * Men.\\
118 - Just so you know,\\
119 - I like this even less than you do.\\
120 - That's hard to believe.\\
121 - ALAN: I got to tell you,\\
122 - Mom, you are looking younger every year.\\
123 - Uh-huh.\\
124 - I do.\\
125 - I don't.\\
126 - So, uh, do you like your present?\\
127 - It's stationery with a big "E" on it.\\
128 - It stands for "Evelyn."\\
129 - Very good, darling.\\
130 - Uncle Charlie said the "E" was for "evil."\\
131 - So, any... any big birthday plans?\\
132 - Like what?\\
133 - I don't know. Hot date?\\
134 - As a matter of fact, I did have a date.\\
135 - What happened? He cancelled.\\
136 - Whoa, you got dumped on your birthday?\\
137 - That is so puerile.\\
138 - Or is it?\\
139 - What is wrong with him?\\
140 - Nothing organic. We've had him checked.\\
141 - So, is there birthday cake?\\
142 - Oh, Jake, what is to become of you?\\
143 - Thank God my life is mostly behind me.\\
144 - I'd hate to be your age, preparing to make my way\\
145 - in a world that's coming apart at the seams,\\
146 - while having no discernible job skills\\
147 - or charisma whatsoever.\\
148 - So is that a yea or nay on the cake?\\
149 - * Men.\\
150 - Bye, Mom! Happy birthday!\\
151 - Whoa, that was grim.\\
152 - Yeah, who has a birthday party without cake?\\
153 - Your uncle really dodged a bullet, didn't he?\\
154 - Yeah, he did.\\
155 - Hey, Dad...\\
156 - maybe we shouldn't leave Grandma alone.\\
157 - She seemed kind of depressed.\\
158 - Oh, uh, don't worry.\\
159 - She doesn't commit suicide. She inspires it.\\
160 - I was just thinking maybe it'd be nice\\
161 - to have her to Uncle Charlie's for a real birthday dinner.\\
162 - You know, Jake, it's moments like this that make me proud.\\
163 - You've got a big heart.\\
164 - Okay, we'll bring her back to Uncle Charlie's.\\
165 - * Men.\\
166 - Hey. Hey.\\
167 - How was your time in hell?\\
168 - So good he brought a little back with him.\\
169 - Hey. Hey, Mom.\\
170 - Happy birthday.\\
171 - I-I...\\
172 - would have come over, but...\\
173 - Oh, come on, do I really need a reason?\\
174 - That's all right. I don't expect much from you.\\
175 - And you never disappoint me.\\
176 - Now, if you'll excuse me,\\
177 - I'm going to drown my sorrows in alcohol.\\
178 - If you're not committed to alcohol,\\
179 - there's a whole big ocean out there.\\
180 - What the hell are you doing?\\
181 - Oh, I just thought it would be nice\\
182 - if we had a little birthday dinner for her.\\
183 - You thought it would be nice to bring Mom to my house?\\
184 - Actually, it was Jake's idea.\\
185 - Of course. Jake.\\
186 - And where is... the boy?\\
187 - It's Sunday. I dropped him off at his Mom's.\\
188 - (phone rings)\\
189 - Hey, Uncle Charlie. How's it going?\\
190 - You rat bastard.\\
191 - Payback's a bitch, ain't it?\\
192 - Bye.\\
193 - What did he mean, "payback's a bitch"?\\
194 - EVELYN: Damn it, Charlie,\\
195 - how am I supposed to make a martini\\
196 - without green olives?\\
197 - He misspoke.\\
198 - He meant, "the bitch is payback."\\
199 - * Men.\\
200 - * Men.\\
201 - (sighs)\\
202 - So this is it?\\
203 - We're just going to sit here watching television\\
204 - till dinnertime?\\
205 - I'm hoping to do it till bedtime.\\
206 - We can't talk?\\
207 - What would you like to talk about?\\
208 - Don't encourage her, Alan.\\
209 - Well, what comes immediately to mind\\
210 - is the futility of love,\\
211 - the disappointment of family,\\
212 - and the inevitability of death.\\
213 - I'd be right with you if "inevitable" meant "now."\\
214 - Well, I am sorry,\\
215 - but I cannot go along with you two gloomy Guses.\\
216 - I look at life, and I see the cup as half full.\\
217 - But the cup belongs to your brother,\\
218 - and what it's half full of is tears.\\
219 - (laughs) Good one, Mom.\\
220 - You're no one to talk.\\
221 - He at least aspires to normalcy,\\
222 - tries to have meaningful relationships with women.\\
223 - You go out with a girl and break up with her\\
224 - before her hoo-ha can develop a 5:00 shadow.\\
225 - Well, uh, in his defense, Mom,\\
226 - he's usually paying by the hour.\\
227 - Very smart, Alan.\\
228 - Bite the syphilitic hand that feeds you.\\
229 - Well, if neither of you is going to refill my drink,\\
230 - I'll do it myself.\\
231 - Help yourself, Mom.\\
232 - I keep the vodka in a bleach bottle.\\
233 - I can't take this anymore. I got to get out of here.\\
234 - You're gonna leave me alone with her?\\
235 - Hey, hey, I was alone with her\\
236 - for two years before you were born. You owe me.\\
237 - Why don't we both make a break for it?\\
238 - Okay. Great.\\
239 - On three.\\
240 - One...\\
241 - Two...\\
242 - You're supposed to say "go" after "three."\\
243 - Before we pick up the olives, can we stop at a pharmacy?\\
244 - Sure.\\
245 - Isn't anybody gonna ask why?\\
246 - Fine. Uh, why?\\
247 - Don't ask if you don't care.\\
248 - It's a woman problem.\\
249 - 'Nough said.\\
250 - As you get older, certain parts of your body\\
251 - don't lubricate properly.\\
252 - Please, God, tell me you have to pick up some Visine.\\
253 - I'm not talking about my eyes, Charlie.\\
254 - (groaning) (groaning)\\
255 - Oh, sure, one can masturbate to keep things flowing,\\
256 - but it's not the same as actual intercourse.\\
257 - What's his problem?\\
258 - Just give him a minute.\\
259 - * Men.\\
260 - That was very rude\\
261 - leaving us sitting there on the side of the road.\\
262 - Would you rather I threw up in the car?\\
263 - Hey, Charlie.\\
264 - Oh, hey, Russell.\\
265 - This is my mother Evelyn and my brother Alan.\\
266 - Hi. Hey.\\
267 - Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.\\
268 - Can I interest you folks in a codeine Popsicle?\\
269 - It's my own invention.\\
270 - I think we're good, Russell.\\
271 - You suck on one of these, you'll be great.\\
272 - I call it "Springtime on a Stick."\\
273 - Yeah, listen,\\
274 - my mom needs some, um...\\
275 - RUSSELL: Mm-hmm?\\
276 - Mom?\\
277 - Birth control pills.\\
278 - Do you have a prescription?\\
279 - Kidding. We're all friends here. Oh. (laughs)\\
280 - Come on back, and I'll show you our selection.\\
281 - Oh, aren't you a doll?\\
282 - And I'm anatomically correct.\\
283 - Oh, good to know.\\
284 - Why did she ask for birth control pills?\\
285 - Gee, Alan, I don't know.\\
286 - Maybe she didn't want to lead with her dry hoo-ha.\\
287 - Are you thinking what I'm thinking?\\
288 - Yes, but this time, let's be clear.\\
289 - Do we run on "go" or just "three"?\\
290 - Oh, no, no. There's no running.\\
291 - Let's set her up with Russell.\\
292 - Oh, gee, I'm not so sure that's a good match.\\
293 - When the hell did this become eHarmony?\\
294 - We just need to get her out of our hair.\\
295 - Oh, right, right.\\
296 - Follow my lead.\\
297 - Thanks, Russell.\\
298 - These'll be just fine. Hmm.\\
299 - What do I owe you?\\
300 - Oh, it's on the house.\\
301 - Any mom of Charlie's\\
302 - is a potential lifelong customer of mine.\\
303 - Aren't you sweet!\\
304 - Or it could just be Mr. Popsicle talking.\\
305 - Hey, listen, Russell, um,\\
306 - we're having a little birthday dinner for Mom tonight,\\
307 - so if you're not doing anything, maybe you'd like to join us.\\
308 - Oh, what a wonderful idea.\\
309 - I'd love to.\\
310 - What can I bring--\\
311 - Xanax, Ritalin?\\
312 - What are you serving?\\
313 - Chinese takeout.\\
314 - Then, perhaps something from the opiate family.\\
315 - (Evelyn laughs)\\
316 - Bring whatever you want.\\
317 - Done and done.\\
318 - And I will see you later, birthday girl.\\
319 - Well, I'll see you later, anatomically correct boy.\\
320 - So, around 7:00?\\
321 - With bells on. Thanks for the invite.\\
322 - You're welcome.\\
323 - You poor, clueless bastard.\\
324 - * Men.\\
325 - I don't know why I didn't think of this years ago.\\
326 - Russell's perfect for Mom.\\
327 - They've both been divorced multiple times,\\
328 - they're both trying desperately to hang onto their youth,\\
329 - plus, they're both big fans of class A narcotics.\\
330 - Does Russell have kids?\\
331 - Uh, none that he admits to.\\
332 - BOTH: Just like Mom.\\
333 - EVELYN: Well, boys,\\
334 - what do you think?\\
335 - Wow, you look terrific.\\
336 - It's not too much, is it?\\
337 - No, no, no, the bright colors are good for Russell.\\
338 - It keeps him from nodding off.\\
339 - I just want you both to know how grateful I am for everything\\
340 - you've done to make this a special birthday for me.\\
341 - Well, you're-you're welcome, Mom.\\
342 - Just want to make you happy.\\
343 - Thank you, but if you really wanted to make me happy,\\
344 - you would have made different life choices.\\
345 - (doorbell rings)\\
346 - Oh, that's him.\\
347 - Hang on.\\
348 - All right, open the door.\\
349 - Russell?\\
350 - Russell!\\
351 - Oh, hi, Charlie.\\
352 - This is Jill.\\
353 - Oh, hi, Jill. Come on in.\\
354 - Thanks.\\
355 - What's with the date?\\
356 - Well, you said bring whatever I want.\\
357 - I want her.\\
358 - I'll be right back.\\
359 - Where are you going? To put on panties.\\
360 - * Men.\\
361 - So, uh, what do you do for a living, Jill?\\
362 - Well, I'm an actress, but you know how it is.\\
363 - Once you turn 30, parts dry up.\\
364 - You think your parts are drying up now,\\
365 - wait'll you turn 50.\\
366 - Ah, don't worry, sweetie.\\
367 - By the time you're 50, I'll be dead.\\
368 - So, how long have you two been dating?\\
369 - We're not dating.\\
370 - We have an arrangement.\\
371 - Arrangement?\\
372 - I let him climb on top of me\\
373 - a couple of times a month, and he pays my rent.\\
374 - Four glorious months and counting.\\
375 - Hey, Russell, you mind helping me\\
376 - make another batch of margaritas?\\
377 - Oh, it'd be my pleasure.\\
378 - You know what's good on the rim of a margarita?\\
379 - Salt?\\
380 - Pharmaceutical cocaine.\\
381 - It's actually good around the rim of anything.\\
382 - Okay, I'm only gonna ask this once.\\
383 - What did you think I meant when I invited you\\
384 - to a birthday dinner for my single mother?\\
385 - I don't know.\\
386 - When you came into the store,\\
387 - I was higher than Mel Gibson on Passover.\\
388 - I cannot believe you actually walked in here\\
389 - with a smokin' hot 30-year-old.\\
390 - What's so hard to believe?\\
391 - She's an out-of-work actress, and I have money and drugs.\\
392 - I guess this isn't exactly the birthday party\\
393 - you were hoping for.\\
394 - No, no, what every woman dreams of is her sons fixing her up\\
395 - with a man who arrives with a young, hot... arrangement.\\
396 - Well, if it makes you feel any better,\\
397 - when he touches me, I want to vomit.\\
398 - It actually does, thank you.\\
399 - You know, it's, uh... it's funny you should say that.\\
400 - Um, my first wife Judith, uh, towards the end of our marriage,\\
401 - uh, used to make this face like, uh, like she was gagging.\\
402 - Sort of a...\\
403 - No one cares, Alan.\\
404 - Now, Jill, listen to me.\\
405 - You still have time to make changes in your life.\\
406 - You don't want to end up old and used-up and alone like me.\\
407 - I'm always here for you, Mom.\\
408 - (sighs)\\
409 - Like I said, make changes.\\
410 - CHARLIE: Okay.\\
411 - Another margarita for the birthday chiquita.\\
412 - Oh, hit me.\\
413 - Um, Evelyn, I believe I owe you an apology.\\
414 - (Russell sighs)\\
415 - When Charlie invited me to dinner,\\
416 - I had no idea that he was thinking\\
417 - that you and I were a potential couple.\\
418 - I mean, you're\\
419 - a handsome woman...\\
420 - ...but my tastes run more to\\
421 - baby veal.\\
422 - I understand.\\
423 - She's veal, and I'm jerky.\\
424 - Good, so you get it.\\
425 - Excuse me.\\
426 - (clears throat)\\
427 - Wow. That could have been awkward.\\
428 - One of us should probably go talk to her.\\
429 - I'll go talk to her.\\
430 - I can't believe I'm hitting that.\\
431 - I can't believe I'm not hitting you.\\
432 - * Men.\\
433 - Wait, wait-- you're opening a drug rehab facility in Malibu?\\
434 - (laughs)\\
435 - No, not-not rehab, prehab.\\
436 - What the hell is that? Prehab?\\
437 - All right, think about it.\\
438 - Rich celebrities will spend $50,000 a month\\
439 - to go some place nice where they won't do drugs.\\
440 - Imagine how much they would spend\\
441 - to go to a snazzy place on the beach\\
442 - to do them.\\
443 - What about the legal issues?\\
444 - What are you, a cop?\\
445 - No.\\
446 - Then shut up.\\
447 - Hey, is it me,\\
448 - or have Mom and Jill been gone for quite a while?\\
449 - Time is a very subjective thing, Charlie,\\
450 - especially when you're abusing powerful anti-psychotics.\\
451 - One of us should probably go check and see\\
452 - if everything's okay.\\
453 - One of us should probably answer that phone first.\\
454 - * Men.\\
455 - Mom?\\
456 - (water running)\\
457 - EVELYN (laughing): Oh, that tickles.\\
458 - JILL (laughing): You started it.\\
459 - Happy birthday.\\
460 - EVELYN: Oh, Jill.\\
461 - JILL: Oh, Evelyn.\\
462 - (women laughing)\\
463 - On three?\\
464 - You wait till three.\\
465 - * Men.\\
466 - * Men.\\
467 - (TV plays in the background)\\
468 - I can't believe Mom ran off with this idiot's girlfriend.\\
469 - I can't believe this idiot's still here.\\
470 - It's not that I can't hear you.\\
471 - It's that I'm busy talking to Jim Morrison.\\
472 - Incredible.\\
473 - Excuse me a minute, Jim.\\
474 - I don't want to spook you fellas,\\
475 - but I took a handful of Viagra\\
476 - in anticipation of a different kind of evening.\\
477 - Three. Three.\\
478 - What are you looking at?
\subsection {Episode 09: A Good Time in Central Africa}
1 - * Men.\\
2 - (slurring words): Yeah, hi.\\
3 - I'm watching your commercial for the Shake Weight?\\
4 - Yeah, I gotta tell ya,\\
5 - my brother does basically the same thing\\
6 - in the shower every day\\
7 - and he has absolutely no muscle tone in his arms.\\
8 - All right, I'm out of here. Hold on a sec.\\
9 - What does this look like to you, Berta?\\
10 - Your brother in the shower?\\
11 - You hear that? It's not just me.\\
12 - Thanks, Berta. I'll see you tomorrow.\\
13 - No, you won't.\\
14 - I told you, I'm going to a family reunion for a few days.\\
15 - But what about me?\\
16 - All right,\\
17 - let's go through this one more time.\\
18 - I arranged to have a friend fill in for me.\\
19 - Her name is Esmerelda.\\
20 - I have given her\\
21 - detailed instructions\\
22 - about how you like things done around here.\\
23 - Did you tell her to roll me over on my stomach\\
24 - so I don't choke on my own vomit?\\
25 - That's number one on the list.\\
26 - Is she hot?\\
27 - She was in the '70s.\\
28 - I guess it's better that way.\\
29 - Yeah, it's tough enough that you and I have sexual tension.\\
30 - Oh, by the way, you promised me vacation pay.\\
31 - Okay.\\
32 - How much did we agree on?\\
33 - That looks about right.\\
34 - Bye.\\
35 - See you tomorrow.\\
36 - Uncle Charlie in there?\\
37 - Yep.\\
38 - Drunk?\\
39 - Hammered.\\
40 - You clean him out?\\
41 - Would I do that to my little buddy?\\
42 - Thank you, Berta.\\
43 - All right, have a good weekend, Uncle Charlie.\\
44 - Enjoy your family reunion.\\
45 - What?\\
46 - What?\\
47 - You know, you still owe me\\
48 - for that pizza from the other night.\\
49 - Oh, yeah, sorry.\\
50 - How much was it?\\
51 - That'll do it.\\
52 - Jake, let's go. Your mom's outside.\\
53 - See ya, Uncle Charlie.\\
54 - See ya, buddy.\\
55 - Thanks for the pizza.\\
56 - When did you guys have pizza?\\
57 - I have no idea.\\
58 - Hey, Charlie, you remember Lyndsey?\\
59 - Nope.\\
60 - Hey, look.\\
61 - (chuckles)\\
62 - I'm exercising.\\
63 - Oh, maybe you ought to sit down for a minute.\\
64 - Good idea.\\
65 - I'm getting a little dizzy.\\
66 - I hope I don't have a heart problem.\\
67 - No, you have a drinking problem.\\
68 - That's a relief.\\
69 - So who's this Lyndsey?\\
70 - You remember-- Lyndsey, early 40s, blonde, pretty.\\
71 - No recollection.\\
72 - I burned her house down.\\
73 - She left me, went back to her ex-husband?\\
74 - Keep going.\\
75 - Nice, full, very natural looking C-cup?\\
76 - Oh, right, Lyndsey.\\
77 - Here we go.\\
78 - What are you doing?\\
79 - Child-proofing you.\\
80 - Thank you.\\
81 - So you're-you're dating\\
82 - Lindsay Lohan?\\
83 - No, no, Lyndsey MacElroy.\\
84 - Anyway, she called and apparently\\
85 - things aren't working out with the ex-husband,\\
86 - and even though she didn't exactly say she\\
87 - wanted to get back together, I am going to meet her for dinner.\\
88 - Well, that's great. Mm-hmm.\\
89 - Good for you.\\
90 - How do I look?\\
91 - Like Lance Armstrong after a three-day drunk.\\
92 - Nice.\\
93 - Mm-hmm.\\
94 - You are a good brother, Alan.\\
95 - Have some money.\\
96 - Thanks.\\
97 - If I were really a good brother,\\
98 - I would stage an intervention.\\
99 - Thanks for the pizza.\\
100 - Eureka.\\
101 - I've invented the drinking helmet.\\
102 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
103 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
104 - * Men.\\
105 - (sighs)\\
106 - Hello?\\
107 - (speaking Spanish)\\
108 - Oh, man, did I go to Tijuana last night?\\
109 - Me... you...\\
110 - Not married, are we?\\
111 - I guess if the answer was yes,\\
112 - she wouldn't be polishing the piano.\\
113 - Hey, Alan, quick question.\\
114 - Yeah?\\
115 - Who is that in our living room?\\
116 - That's Esmerelda.\\
117 - Gonna need more.\\
118 - Berta's friend?\\
119 - Keep going.\\
120 - Berta went to her family reunion.\\
121 - Esmerelda's filling in for her.\\
122 - Oh. It would have been nice if she'd given me a heads-up.\\
123 - Aren't you going to ask me about last night?\\
124 - Oh, yeah.\\
125 - What did I do last night?\\
126 - Somehow I spent almost all my money.\\
127 - No, I meant what I did last night.\\
128 - Oh. No.\\
129 - Lyndsey wants to get back together.\\
130 - C-cups.\\
131 - Right. Lyndsey.\\
132 - She did split up with her ex-husband Chris.\\
133 - Said she realized she didn't want to go backwards.\\
134 - In what universe is dating you not going backwards?\\
135 - I know. This guy must be some kind of mess.\\
136 - Breakfast, Se  or Harper?\\
137 - Why is she saying breakfast?\\
138 - Am I supposed to make her breakfast?\\
139 - She'll make it for you.\\
140 - Try the huevos rancheros-- they're amazing.\\
141 - (speaking Spanish)\\
142 - Muy bien. Gracias.\\
143 - Junior high, high school, college,\\
144 - two years of chiropractic school in Mexico.\\
145 - You say that like I'm supposed to know.\\
146 - You are supposed to know. You're my brother.\\
147 - (Esmerelda laughing)\\
148 - What's so funny?\\
149 - Are you talking about me?\\
150 - She says she likes your hat.\\
151 - * Men.\\
152 - CHARLIE: Alan! Come here, quick!\\
153 - Please God, don't let it be a dead girl.\\
154 - What is it?\\
155 - Open my door and tell me what you see.\\
156 - Why? What do you see?\\
157 - Just look.\\
158 - Are the flying monkeys back?\\
159 - Don't joke about that, Alan.\\
160 - Wow.\\
161 - Esmerelda did this?\\
162 - Can you believe it?\\
163 - The fresh cut flowers,\\
164 - the carafe of lemon water.\\
165 - She even laid out my robe and slippers.\\
166 - Since when do you have slippers?\\
167 - I don't know. Is it possible she made them?\\
168 - She put a chocolate on your pillow? Yup.\\
169 - See what it says?\\
170 - "Felicidad."\\
171 - That means "Merry Christmas," right?\\
172 - It means "happiness."\\
173 - You sure? What about that song, uh, "Felicidad Navidas"?\\
174 - "Feliz Navidad"?\\
175 - Tomato, tamale.\\
176 - The point is,\\
177 - Esmerelda is a terrific housekeeper.\\
178 - I didn't get a chocolate.\\
179 - You're not Se  or Harper.\\
180 - I'm a Se  or Harper.\\
181 - Yes, but not the Se  or Harper that pays her.\\
182 - Come on, you got to see this.\\
183 - She still could have given me a chocolate.\\
184 - How much could it cost?\\
185 - Look!\\
186 - That's not a swan.\\
187 - That's my towel.\\
188 - Nice touch.\\
189 - Had me fooled at first.\\
190 - I tried to kill it.\\
191 - And look.\\
192 - She folded my toilet paper into a little point.\\
193 - After breakfast, I used some, stood up, shaved,\\
194 - and when I looked back, I swear it was pointed again.\\
195 - Is that a votive candle?\\
196 - Yup.\\
197 - She's praying that I have pleasant bowel movements.\\
198 - Oh, please.\\
199 - No, no, no, it's working.\\
200 - This morning, soft, firm, easy peasy.\\
201 - But wait, there's more.\\
202 - Come on.\\
203 - Tada!\\
204 - She bought you a new grill?!\\
205 - No, no, no, this is the old grill.\\
206 - You know what she did?\\
207 - What? She cleaned it.\\
208 - She cleaned the grill?\\
209 - Berta never cleans the grill.\\
210 - Tell me about it.\\
211 - She only comes out on the deck to smoke pot.\\
212 - Se  or Harper?\\
213 - Yes?\\
214 - She's talking to me, Baba Looey. Yes?\\
215 - Hell, yeah, botanas.\\
216 - What's that mean, "screw you"?\\
217 - Basically.\\
218 - I love this woman.\\
219 - Esmerelda, te amo.\\
220 - Ay, Se  or.\\
221 - I thought you didn't speak Spanish.\\
222 - I don't, but I do know how to say "I love you"\\
223 - and "How much for a happy ending?"\\
224 - in, like, 17 different languages.\\
225 - You're kidding.\\
226 - (speaking foreign language and clicking)\\
227 - In case you ever want to have a good time in Central Africa.\\
228 - * Men.\\
229 - (doorbell ringing)\\
230 - CHARLIE: Alan, get that!\\
231 - Esmerelda's giving me a pedicure!\\
232 - Pedicure. I can't even get a freakin' chocolate.\\
233 - Hello, Alan.\\
234 - Chris! Hey.\\
235 - Uh, what brings you by?\\
236 - Well, Lyndsey mentioned that you two are dating again,\\
237 - and I wanted to let you know\\
238 - that if I had to lose her, I'm glad it was to you.\\
239 - Thank you.\\
240 - How did you get my address?\\
241 - Not important.\\
242 - Here, I brought you a little gift.\\
243 - Okay.\\
244 - (chuckles)\\
245 - Nothing in here's gonna bite me, is it?\\
246 - (chuckles) Open it.\\
247 - Oh.\\
248 - Look at that.\\
249 - It's a picture of Lyndsey and you.\\
250 - Yeah. Look how happy we were.\\
251 - We just found out she was pregnant.\\
252 - It kind of looks like she's glowing, but it's really just\\
253 - the lights from the Ferris wheel on the Santa Monica Pier.\\
254 - I-I can't accept this.\\
255 - Oh, I want you to have it.\\
256 - You need to see how happy Lyndsey made me,\\
257 - so you can be that happy.\\
258 - Okay, I'm not quite sure I follow the logic,\\
259 - um, but-but thank you.\\
260 - See you around.\\
261 - (clicks tongue)\\
262 - (clicks tongue)\\
263 - Ah, it's too late, Alan.\\
264 - You're already dead.\\
265 - Well, that was a bit disturbing.\\
266 - * Men.\\
267 - * Men.\\
268 - Okay, uh, one decaf grande soy chai latte\\
269 - with extra whipped cream.\\
270 - Uh, and a black coffee for the lady.\\
271 - Thank you.\\
272 - I don't know how you drink that stuff.\\
273 - Back at you.\\
274 - Name? Uh, Alan.\\
275 - So, what's so important that you didn't want\\
276 - to talk about it on the phone?\\
277 - Oh, it's not that it's important,\\
278 - uh, it's just that it's...\\
279 - Alan, if you dragged me down here\\
280 - to break up with me, I will murder you.\\
281 - Oh, no, nobody's breaking up.\\
282 - But, uh, speaking of murder,\\
283 - I saw your ex-husband yesterday.\\
284 - I'm sorry, "speaking of murder"?\\
285 - Oh, oh, maybe I should back up a little.\\
286 - Um, Chris showed up at my house and handed me\\
287 - what I consider to be a very inappropriate photo of you two.\\
288 - That bastard!\\
289 - He told me he threw those pictures away.\\
290 - Okay, I-I don't think we're talking about the same pictures.\\
291 - Uh, but the point is, before he left, he shot at me.\\
292 - He shot at you?\\
293 - Oh, not with a gun, with his finger.\\
294 - But the implication was pretty darn clear.\\
295 - Okay, let me get this straight.\\
296 - I wasn't naked in the picture?\\
297 - No, you were at the Santa Monica Pier.\\
298 - But not naked, right?\\
299 - Right.\\
300 - Uh, but again, my concern here\\
301 - is that your ex-husband seems to be threatening me.\\
302 - Oh, Chris is harmless.\\
303 - His bark is way worse than his bite.\\
304 - So you're saying he does bite?\\
305 - Alan, you have nothing to worry about.\\
306 - And if it'll make you feel better,\\
307 - I'll talk to Chris next time I see him.\\
308 - Talk to me about what? What the hell?!\\
309 - How long have you been sitting there?\\
310 - I just got here.\\
311 - I was gonna come say hi,\\
312 - but I thought it was a little creepy--\\
313 - ex-husband, new boyfriend.\\
314 - Are you following us?\\
315 - No. I just stopped in to have a cup of coffee.\\
316 - You live on the other side of town.\\
317 - But I like the coffee here.\\
318 - Okay, I don't know what you're trying to accomplish,\\
319 - but it needs to stop right now.\\
320 - Uh, I've got this, Lyndsey.\\
321 - Now... listen up, pal.\\
322 - I'm dating your ex-wife,\\
323 - and there's nothing you can do about it.\\
324 - Do you understand me?\\
325 - (shrieks): Police! Police!\\
326 - Whoa.\\
327 - Calm down.\\
328 - Chris, get out of here.\\
329 - I'm leaving.\\
330 - Oh, Alan.\\
331 - What?\\
332 - See you around.\\
333 - See? See?\\
334 - He shot me again!\\
335 - Calm down.\\
336 - Calm down?! This guy is crazy.\\
337 - We need get a restraining order or something.\\
338 - I don't think that's necessary.\\
339 - Of course it's necessary.\\
340 - This is unacceptable behavior, and I am not putting up with it.\\
341 - In fact, forget the restraining order.\\
342 - I'm gonna pay him a visit and make it crystal clear\\
343 - that he is messing with the wrong guy.\\
344 - Alan!\\
345 - (shrieks): Police! Police!\\
346 - * Men.\\
347 - Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.\\
348 - Breakfast time.\\
349 - Esmerelda's huevos rancher...\\
350 - Oh, Berta!\\
351 - Hey.\\
352 - I thought you were at a family reunion.\\
353 - Came home early.\\
354 - Turns out, I don't like my family.\\
355 - So you came back.\\
356 - Yay.\\
357 - So Esmerelda's not coming in anymore?\\
358 - No, I called her.\\
359 - She didn't mess things up too bad, did she?\\
360 - No, no, no. I mean, she's not you,\\
361 - so there was a little adjustment.\\
362 - What's that you're eating?\\
363 - Western omelette.\\
364 - Oh. Looks good.\\
365 - It is.\\
366 - Which reminds me, you're out of eggs.\\
367 - (door opens, closes)\\
368 - ALAN: Charlie?\\
369 - In here.\\
370 - Staring at me while I eat\\
371 - is making me very uncomfortable.\\
372 - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\\
373 - Charlie, I've got a problem.\\
374 - How about that,\\
375 - the problem's got a problem.\\
376 - Berta's back.\\
377 - Yay.\\
378 - I'm going somewhere I can eat in peace.\\
379 - I thought my family was annoying.\\
380 - Can you believe it?\\
381 - Esmerelda's gone.\\
382 - Yeah, boo-hoo.\\
383 - Lyndsey's ex-husband threatened to kill me.\\
384 - How is that a bigger problem\\
385 - than me having to make my own breakfast?\\
386 - I'm serious, Charlie.\\
387 - He's crazy.\\
388 - Well, of course he's crazy.\\
389 - He's an ex-husband.\\
390 - The two words go together.\\
391 - "Crazy ex-husband."\\
392 - I'm an ex-husband.\\
393 - There you go.\\
394 - Now, what are we gonna do about Esmerelda?\\
395 - I mean, it's not like I can fire Berta.\\
396 - Sure you can. Frankly, I never cared for the woman.\\
397 - What am I gonna do about Chris?\\
398 - I don't want to lose Lyndsey; I love her.\\
399 - And I love huevos rancheros\\
400 - and chocolate "felicidadas" on my pillow.\\
401 - Okay, we seem to be talking at cross purposes here.\\
402 - 'Cause you're not focusing on the real issue.\\
403 - I've just lost the best housekeeper since...\\
404 - Wilma Flintstone.\\
405 - (screams)\\
406 - What the hell?\\
407 - What was that?\\
408 - A rock.\\
409 - It's got to be Chris.\\
410 - How can you be sure?\\
411 - Who else would throw a rock at me?\\
412 - Good point. I'm here and Mom's out of town.\\
413 - I ain't cleaning that up.\\
414 - * Men.\\
415 - (TV playing quietly)\\
416 - (phone rings)\\
417 - Hello.\\
418 - Hello?\\
419 - ("Up, Up and Away" ringtone playing)\\
420 - Hello?\\
421 - Hello?!\\
422 - Okay, whoever this is,\\
423 - you should know that you're not scaring me.\\
424 - (doorbell rings, Alan screams)\\
425 - Esmerelda!\\
426 - Come on in.\\
427 - Buenas noches, Se  or Harper.\\
428 - Yeah, yeah, me, too.\\
429 - Esmerelda?\\
430 - Oh, como esta, Se  or Alan?\\
431 - Muy bien.\\
432 - Charlie, what's going on?\\
433 - Excusez-moi.\\
434 - From now on, Berta will be our day housekeeper\\
435 - and Esmerelda will be our night housekeeper.\\
436 - Capiche?\\
437 - Does Berta know?\\
438 - Berta doesn't need to know.\\
439 - Uh-huh. So what's she gonna think when she comes back\\
440 - and she sees the pointed toilet paper and the swan towels?\\
441 - Way ahead of you.\\
442 - I'll just un-swan and un-point everything\\
443 - before she gets here.\\
444 - Then why do it?\\
445 - I mean, is it worth the trouble\\
446 - to sneak around behind Berta's back?\\
447 - I know it's crazy, but...\\
448 - ...the woman makes me happy.\\
449 - Botanas, Se  or Harper?\\
450 - Oh, si... vous pla  t.\\
451 - How about that?\\
452 - I'm even starting to pick up the language.\\
453 - It's a shame the language is French.\\
454 - (phone rings)\\
455 - (screams)\\
456 - * Men.\\
457 - * Men.\\
458 - Alan, relax. If Chris wanted to kill you,\\
459 - he'd just climb through your window while you're sleeping\\
460 - and smother you with a pillow.\\
461 - Thank you, that's very helpful.\\
462 - At least, that's how I always imagined doing it.\\
463 - BERTA: You rat bastard.\\
464 - Berta!\\
465 - It's not what it looks like.\\
466 - Is that so?\\
467 - Then what is it?\\
468 - Uh... it's purely sexual.\\
469 - I'm not stupid, Charlie.\\
470 - I know when I'm being two-timed.\\
471 - Charlie, I'm shocked.\\
472 - Shocked!\\
473 - Berta, I-I had no idea this was going...\\
474 - Stay out of it, Zippy!\\
475 - I'm out.\\
476 - So what do you have to say for yourself?\\
477 - Berta, I am... I am so sorry.\\
478 - I got carried away, but I think if we all sit down like adults\\
479 - and talk this through, we can make it work.\\
480 - Uh-uh.\\
481 - It's either me or her.\\
482 - Oh, please don't make me choose.\\
483 - Berta, I love you both.\\
484 - Good-bye, Charlie.\\
485 - No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
486 - It's you, Berta.\\
487 - It's always been you.\\
488 - I'm sorry.\\
489 - It's just not our time.\\
490 - Please tell her how sorry I am.\\
491 - (speaking Spanish)\\
492 - (both laugh)\\
493 - Adios, Se  or Harper.\\
494 - Arrivederci, Esmerelda.\\
495 - Okay, then.\\
496 - I'll see you tomorrow.\\
497 - Good, good.\\
498 - I'll be late.\\
499 - It's okay.\\
500 - You might want to clean that hair up off the floor\\
501 - before I get in.\\
502 - Sure, I'm on it. Okay.\\
503 - (sighs)\\
504 - Oh, Esmerelda.\\
505 - No.\\
506 - No, I can't let her go.\\
507 - Oh, hey, Chris.\\
508 - Pillows on the couch, Alan's in his room. Esmerelda!
\subsection {Episode 10: Ow, Ow, Don't Stop}
1 - * Men.\\
2 - I've been looking forward to this all year.\\
3 - Giving you people the bird.\\
4 - Oh, it looks great, Berta. What's your secret?\\
5 - I bought it pre-cooked from the back of a truck.\\
6 - I don't know that I'd trust the stuffing.\\
7 - (spoon chiming against glass)\\
8 - I'd like to make a little Thanksgiving toast.\\
9 - I know you don't hear me say it very often,\\
10 - but I really am thankful for every one of you.\\
11 - I've never heard you say that. You ever hear him say that?\\
12 - I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.\\
13 - Anyway, there comes a time in a man's life when he realizes\\
14 - there's nothing more important that family.\\
15 - Is he dying?\\
16 - Probably just drunk.\\
17 - And you know why family is so important?\\
18 - Designated driver? Liver match.\\
19 - Bail money?\\
20 - Prescription medication to steal?\\
21 - Would you please let me continue?\\
22 - Family is important, because no matter what happens,\\
23 - they are the people who are there for you.\\
24 - Good times, bad times, it doesn't matter.\\
25 - Blood is thicker than water.\\
26 - I just want you to know that...\\
27 - I love you all.\\
28 - (doorbell rings)\\
29 - I'll get that.\\
30 - Plowed.\\
31 - Hiya, stranger.\\
32 - Courtney. I thought you were in prison.\\
33 - I was. But I'm out.\\
34 - Want to go to Vegas?\\
35 - Are you crazy? I'm in the middle of\\
36 - Thanksgiving dinner with my family.\\
37 - Not to mention the fact that the last time we were together\\
38 - you kind of ripped me off.\\
39 - I haven't had sex in three years.\\
40 - Good-bye, everybody!\\
41 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
42 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
43 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
44 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
45 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
46 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
47 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
48 - * Men.\\
49 - CHARLIE & COURTNEY: * Viva Las Vegas, chucka-chucka-chucka *\\
50 - * Viva... viva... Las Vegas!\\
51 - (laughing)\\
52 - Hey, Alan, guess where we've been?\\
53 - Las Vegas?\\
54 - Viva!\\
55 - I won $20,000.\\
56 - And look what he bought me.\\
57 - Wow.\\
58 - 30,000 grand.\\
59 - So... you're down $10,000.\\
60 - Could've been worse, but I won a bundle at the roulette table\\
61 - betting the color of her underwear.\\
62 - Red or black?\\
63 - Double zero.\\
64 - What color is that?\\
65 - Ass cheeks.\\
66 - Hey. What happened to your eye?\\
67 - Oh. Heh. Yeah.\\
68 - Little accident. Getting kind of frisky in the tub,\\
69 - and I accidentally fell face first onto a Jacuzzi nozzle.\\
70 - Me, too. Except it wasn't my face, and it wasn't an accident.\\
71 - Good news is, we're both really clean.\\
72 - Inside and out.\\
73 - Should we go upstairs and get dirty again?\\
74 - Right behind you. What else is new?\\
75 - Uh... uh, Charlie?\\
76 - I'll be up in a minute.\\
77 - The trick is to keep it up.\\
78 - What?\\
79 - I-I-I'm just a little concerned.\\
80 - Oh, I almost forgot.\\
81 - Got you a little something.\\
82 - Oh, gee, you didn't have to.\\
83 - Here you go.\\
84 - You can't just buy those, you got to have them specially made.\\
85 - Come to think of it, makes more sense for me to be wearing it.\\
86 - Charlie, hold on.\\
87 - Now what?\\
88 - Do you really think it's a good idea\\
89 - to be starting back in with Courtney?\\
90 - Are you kidding? I just had the best three days of my life.\\
91 - Well, okay, but i-i-it just seems like--\\
92 - I've never even heard of that.\\
93 - Neither had I, until last night, and now...\\
94 - I don't know how I ever lived without them.\\
95 - Look, I'm just saying we're talking about a convicted felon\\
96 - who seems to have very expensive tastes.\\
97 - Yeah, what's your point?\\
98 - So you don't care about anything else,\\
99 - as long as you get to indulge you depraved appetites.\\
100 - Still waiting for a point, Alan.\\
101 - * Men.\\
102 - Jake? Want to go to a movie?\\
103 - (muffled slapping, pounding and moaning)\\
104 - Jake?\\
105 - What are you doing?\\
106 - Resting.\\
107 - Guess you're-- wondering what's going on up there.\\
108 - Not really.\\
109 - Well, just-- just want you to know that\\
110 - there's more to it than what you're hearing right now.\\
111 - I know. They've been going at it all afternoon.\\
112 - No, no, what-what I mean is--\\
113 - A couple of times I thought somebody was going to die.\\
114 - No, what I'm trying to say is--\\
115 - I didn't know human beings could make those sounds.\\
116 - Okay. What I'm saying is, there's more to a healthy,\\
117 - fulfilling relationship than-- than just sex.\\
118 - CHARLIE: Oh, yeah, baby, right there. That's what I'm talking about.\\
119 - Like, uh... mutual responsibility.\\
120 - Uh, uh, mutual respect.\\
121 - COURTNEY: Oh, I'm a slut, I'm a dirty little slut!\\
122 - Taking care of each other.\\
123 - CHARLIE: Now do the Rain Goggles.\\
124 - (pounding and moaning continues)\\
125 - Sharing... things.\\
126 - CHARLIE: Oh! Oh! COURTNEY: Oh! Ooh! Oh!\\
127 - CHARLIE: Arigato!\\
128 - Dad. Yeah?\\
129 - Get out.\\
130 - Good talk.\\
131 - * Men.\\
132 - Morning.\\
133 - Morning.\\
134 - Dean Martin and the Gold Digger keep you up again last night?\\
135 - He's lost his mind, Berta.\\
136 - All he does is have sex with her and spend money on her.\\
137 - Sometimes he spends money on her while he's having sex with her.\\
138 - How's that?\\
139 - I picked up the phone and accidentally overheard\\
140 - a very disturbing call to QVC.\\
141 - Pearl necklace. I'll say no more.\\
142 - Morning.\\
143 - Morning. Morning.\\
144 - Nice shirt. It's not too subtle, is it?\\
145 - Something wrong with your arm?\\
146 - I'm not sure.\\
147 - Think I pinched a nerve last night\\
148 - reaching around, trying to scratch Courtney's back.\\
149 - Her back.\\
150 - Trying to be delicate here, Alan.\\
151 - And God knows we appreciate it.\\
152 - Good morning, everyone!\\
153 - ALL: Morning.\\
154 - Morning, baby.\\
155 - Car keys?\\
156 - Credit card?\\
157 - Kiss?\\
158 - See ya!\\
159 - Have fun!\\
160 - "Have fun"?\\
161 - You just gave her the keys to your Mercedes\\
162 - and an unlimited credit card.\\
163 - Yeah? So? That's fun.\\
164 - Can't you see she's using you?\\
165 - You should've seen the way she used me last night.\\
166 - In fact... you can.\\
167 - Oh, no. No.\\
168 - No, I don't-- I don't--\\
169 - I-I-I just don't want to see you get played by her again.\\
170 - Relax. I know what I'm doing.\\
171 - I'm having fun, she's having fun. Nobody's getting hurt.\\
172 - You have a black eye and a dead arm.\\
173 - Obviously, we have different definitions of "fun."\\
174 - What is wrong with him?\\
175 - Classic case of va-jay-jay fever.\\
176 - Colorfully put.\\
177 - I'm just surprised to see Charlie fall for it.\\
178 - Sooner or later, all men fall for it.\\
179 - How do you think I got my condo in Palm Springs?\\
180 - You've got a condo in Palm Springs?\\
181 - No, figure of speech. Don't try to stop by.\\
182 - * Men.\\
183 - You caught me at a bad time, darling.\\
184 - I was just going out.\\
185 - Well, I'm sorry, but I have a problem.\\
186 - Just the one?\\
187 - It's about Charlie.\\
188 - Well, sweetheart,\\
189 - you have been sponging off him for eight years.\\
190 - You've got to expect a little abuse.\\
191 - Oh, no, no, no, it's not that.\\
192 - I'm worried about Charlie and Courtney.\\
193 - I-I-I really think she's taking advantage of him.\\
194 - Uh-huh. And what are you worried about?\\
195 - Well... I just said. Charlie could lose everything.\\
196 - Oh, I see. Well, I understand your concern.\\
197 - Thank you. It's not like you could move in here.\\
198 - Oh, no, no, I'm not just worried about me.\\
199 - Wait a second. You used to beg me to move in with Jake.\\
200 - That's when Jake was cute,\\
201 - and I still had a little bit of hope left for you.\\
202 - Okay, well, anyway--\\
203 - Alan. Your brother is a grown man.\\
204 - I'm sure he can take care of himself.\\
205 - I'm not sure he can.\\
206 - You should see the way she's sucking him dry.\\
207 - I should hope so.\\
208 - Mom.\\
209 - Alan. There's not much you can do\\
210 - when a graspy, greedy woman\\
211 - sinks her claws into a vulnerable man.\\
212 - Marty! I'm leaving! Come kiss me goodbye!\\
213 - Come here, hot stuff. Give me some tongue!\\
214 - Marty, my son Alan is here.\\
215 - You've met Alan.\\
216 - The fruitball? No tongue for you.\\
217 - Cupcake, I need your credit card.\\
218 - The usual place.\\
219 - Oh, you bad boy.\\
220 - Dig a little deeper.\\
221 - There's a hole in this pocket.\\
222 - Keep going.\\
223 - Surprise!\\
224 - Well, how nice for you.\\
225 - But I've got to run!\\
226 - Oh, damn, I worked on it all morning.\\
227 - You know what? I'll just go. Nice to see you, Mr. Pepper.\\
228 - Mr. Pepper was my father.\\
229 - Just call me "the guy banging your mother."\\
230 - I think I'll stick with "Mr. Pepper." Bye, Mom.\\
231 - Bye, dear.\\
232 - Anything you need before I go?\\
233 - Yes. Uh...\\
234 - Check my pocket again.\\
235 - * Men.\\
236 - Hey, boys.\\
237 - Hi. Hi.\\
238 - What's all this stuff?\\
239 - Okay, here's the red one.\\
240 - What do you guys think?\\
241 - BOTH: Uh...\\
242 - The yellow one's better, right?\\
243 - I'm not sure. What do you think, Eldridge?\\
244 - I think we need to see the yellow one again.\\
245 - Okay, okay, guys-- I'd like to talk to Courtney.\\
246 - JAKE: Go ahead.\\
247 - Pretend we're not here.\\
248 - Okay, let me put it another way.\\
249 - Get out.\\
250 - Bye, Courtney. Bye, Courtney.\\
251 - Bye, fellas.\\
252 - Thanks again for inviting me over.\\
253 - Was I lying?\\
254 - So... What do you want to talk about?\\
255 - Uh, well, the thing is--\\
256 - Are my boobs even?\\
257 - Even... what?\\
258 - Well, I just want to make sure\\
259 - one's not popping out more than the other one.\\
260 - Oh, no, no, no. They're both, uh, uh, popping just...\\
261 - Fine.\\
262 - Great! Mm.\\
263 - So?\\
264 - Huh?\\
265 - What do you want to talk about?\\
266 - Oh, oh, yeah, well, I-I-I wanted to talk about Charlie.\\
267 - What about him?\\
268 - Well, I don't know if you're aware of this,\\
269 - but he went through a bad breakup recently,\\
270 - and he may not look like it,\\
271 - but he's actually in a pretty vulnerable place right now.\\
272 - And you think I'm taking advantage of him?\\
273 - Well... aren't you?\\
274 - Look, I know what you must think of me.\\
275 - Based on some of the stupid things I've done,\\
276 - I don't blame you. But Alan--\\
277 - I've changed.\\
278 - What about all this stuff?\\
279 - Well, he likes buying me things. Makes him happy.\\
280 - Believe me, the money is fun, but it's Charlie I care about.\\
281 - Really?\\
282 - Really.\\
283 - Well, okay, then.\\
284 - Thank you, uh-- I feel better now.\\
285 - (doorbell rings)\\
286 - Hey, beautiful. You ready to go?\\
287 - Yeah, let me just grab my purse.\\
288 - Oh! Um, Alan-- James. James-- Alan.\\
289 - Hey. Hey.\\
290 - He's my brother.\\
291 - He was adopted.\\
292 - Yeah, I remain skeptical.\\
293 - * Men.\\
294 - * Men.\\
295 - ALAN: Charlie? In here.\\
296 - What happened to your foot?\\
297 - Broke my toe. Oh, geez!\\
298 - Serves me right, trying to walk around in Courtney's high heels\\
299 - with only one good arm.\\
300 - Why were you wearing her shoes?\\
301 - Because they matched her underwear, duh.\\
302 - Okay. Whatever.\\
303 - I just thought you might want to know\\
304 - that Courtney just left\\
305 - with a handsome, young, African-American fellow.\\
306 - Yeah. Her brother James.\\
307 - And you're buying that.\\
308 - Hey, people have a hard time believing you're my brother.\\
309 - Including me, by the way.\\
310 - And Mom.\\
311 - All right, I'm just going to say this:\\
312 - I don't think you should trust Courtney. I think she's trouble.\\
313 - Well, hell yeah, she's trouble. That's why I love her.\\
314 - You love her?\\
315 - Of course I love her.\\
316 - Courtney is the woman I'm meant to be with.\\
317 - Everything in my life up till now, all the women,\\
318 - they've just been leading me right to her.\\
319 - I would've guessed they were leading you more\\
320 - to a clinic of some sort, but go ahead.\\
321 - You remember how down I was when Chelsea dumped me?\\
322 - And when Rose got married?\\
323 - All of that was necessary\\
324 - in order for me to get back to Courtney.\\
325 - It was also necessary for Courtney to make early parole.\\
326 - Exactly. This was meant to happen!\\
327 - Don't you see it, Alan?\\
328 - Courtney is just the kind of woman I need.\\
329 - She's non-judgmental, free-spirited, open-minded...\\
330 - Double-jointed. Triple.\\
331 - And she can pick up a dime with her butt cheeks.\\
332 - Just do me a favor, and-and take it slow?\\
333 - Give it a little time\\
334 - before you do something stupid that you can't undo.\\
335 - Don't worry, I won't.\\
336 - Good.\\
337 - Oh, yeah, guess what?\\
338 - While we were in Vegas, I got a tattoo.\\
339 - Oh, please don't tell me you got her name put on you?\\
340 - Look.\\
341 - "Get out of my house."\\
342 - The tattoo is temporary, but the sentiment is forever.\\
343 - * Men.\\
344 - You're kidding. Now he's broken his toe?\\
345 - This relationship goes on much longer,\\
346 - he's going to run out of parts.\\
347 - Don't be such a sourpuss. Courtney's a terrific girl,\\
348 - and Charlie's happy as a clam.\\
349 - Wait a second. You never liked Courtney.\\
350 - People change. People grow.\\
351 - People buy expensive gifts for the housekeeper.\\
352 - She bought you that?\\
353 - And the purse. And the sunglasses.\\
354 - Ciao, bella.\\
355 - COURTNEY: Okay, that's it! I am out of here.\\
356 - CHARLIE: Fine by me.\\
357 - You're nothing but a selfish son of a bitch!\\
358 - And you're a gold-digger!\\
359 - Go to hell!\\
360 - I'd meet you there, but they don't take credit cards.\\
361 - Problem?\\
362 - She was just trying to use me, Alan.\\
363 - Really? I'm stunned.\\
364 - I still like her.\\
365 - You know what she wanted me to do?\\
366 - She actually found something you didn't want to do?\\
367 - She wanted me to give her money to pay her brother's rent.\\
368 - I said, "Hey, I've already got one brother leeching off me."\\
369 - Right?\\
370 - Right.\\
371 - This one doesn't even have a job.\\
372 - At least you pretend to be a chiropractor.\\
373 - Well, I have my pride.\\
374 - That's it for me. No more meaningful relationships.\\
375 - I'm going to stick with the honesty and integrity\\
376 - of the traditional hooker-john arrangement.\\
377 - Sometimes the old ways are best.\\
378 - Well, I'm glad you came to your senses about Courtney,\\
379 - and I just want to say--\\
380 - I'm always here for you.\\
381 - I've never doubted that.\\
382 - Well, thank you. It wasn't a compliment.\\
383 - My point was, I think you've made the right decision.\\
384 - I have, haven't I?\\
385 - Well, of course you have. I mean, for God's sake,\\
386 - look what she did to you.\\
387 - Yeah.\\
388 - Oh, my God.\\
389 - I got to get her back!\\
390 - Charlie? No, Courtney--\\
391 - Oh, my God!\\
392 - Are you okay?\\
393 - Oh. I'm not sure.\\
394 - How bad is it?\\
395 - It's fine.\\
396 - (vomiting)\\
397 - I ain't cleaning that up.\\
398 - * Men.\\
399 - * Men.\\
400 - You're a very lucky guy, Charlie.\\
401 - I ran through a plate glass window,\\
402 - and you puked in my piano.\\
403 - How is that lucky?\\
404 - You could have bled to death.\\
405 - And I could have vomited on my suede shoes.\\
406 - Those are my shoes.\\
407 - Which is why you're lucky.\\
408 - Hey, Alan.\\
409 - At the moment, I'm not in your house.\\
410 - All right, well. I'm going to look at this as a wake-up call.\\
411 - Good. Good.\\
412 - Courtney is bad news. I've been telling you.\\
413 - You were right. I was blind.\\
414 - Guess it's hard to see the truth\\
415 - when you're wearing Japanese Rain Goggles.\\
416 - I Googled the goggles.\\
417 - COURTNEY: Charlie?\\
418 - Courtney. What are you doing here?\\
419 - Well, I went back to apologize and there was blood everywhere.\\
420 - I tried every hospital in town trying to find you.\\
421 - Are you all right?\\
422 - Not really.\\
423 - Um, Courtney?\\
424 - I think Charlie has something to tell you.\\
425 - What?\\
426 - Go ahead, Charlie.\\
427 - I love you, Courtney.\\
428 - I love you, too!\\
429 - Ow, ow, ow.\\
430 - Don't stop. Ow, ow, ow...

1 - All right, I have turned "it" into "ziti,"\\
2 - uh, with a triple letter on Z and a double word on the I.\\
3 - Plus, going down, I've created "za."\\
4 - Za?\\
5 - Uh, a colloquialism for pizza.\\
6 - One of the five two-letter words\\
7 - newly accepted by the National Scrabble Association.\\
8 - Unbelievable.\\
9 - You can call them if you want.\\
10 - That's what we in Scrabble circles call\\
11 - a two tile takedown.\\
12 - * Bom-bom!\\
13 - CHARLIE: Hey, Alan,\\
14 - is our limo here yet?\\
15 - Uh, sorry, I haven't seen a limo.\\
16 - Oh, 100 points!\\
17 - * Bow-bow!\\
18 - That's a gorgeous dress, Courtney.\\
19 - Thanks. Charlie insisted on buying it\\
20 - for me to wear tonight.\\
21 - What's the charity again?\\
22 - I don't know. Landmines, orphans.\\
23 - Landmines for orphans.\\
24 - I just want to show you off.\\
25 - Oh.\\
26 - Well, you look great.\\
27 - Thank you.\\
28 - No, no. No, there's...\\
29 - something... something wrong.\\
30 - What?\\
31 - I don't know. I don't know.\\
32 - Something's... something's missing.\\
33 - Oh, I got it.\\
34 - Ta-dah!\\
35 - Charlie!\\
36 - (gasps)\\
37 - You shouldn't have.\\
38 - Well, you've done a lot of things for me\\
39 - you shouldn't have.\\
40 - Oh, my... Now you look great.\\
41 - God, it is beautiful.\\
42 - Thank you.\\
43 - So, what are you guys up to tonight?\\
44 - Oh, not much. Just a quiet, romantic evening at home.\\
45 - Loser.\\
46 - Come on, that's not fair.\\
47 - No, it's my word-- loser.\\
48 - Oh. Oh. Oh, uh, well, then I should point out\\
49 - that you could have used the C\\
50 - at the top of the board and made "closer."\\
51 - I'll stick with loser.\\
52 - (phone ringing)\\
53 - Yeah?\\
54 - Great. We'll be right out.\\
55 - Our chariot awaits.\\
56 - Have fun.\\
57 - Thanks. You, too.\\
58 - Do me a favor.\\
59 - When we get in the limo,\\
60 - ask the driver to put up the partition.\\
61 - You bet.\\
62 - Isn't that sweet?\\
63 - She's gonna do more things she shouldn't.\\
64 - Gluten-free pretzel?\\
65 - No, thanks.\\
66 - Oh, I guess this isn't much of a Saturday night date.\\
67 - Alan, it's fine.\\
68 - I like staying in with you.\\
69 - I could probably do without the * Bom-bom!\\
70 - Well, I just... I wish I could take you out\\
71 - and get you things like Charlie does.\\
72 - I don't need those things.\\
73 - I mean, they're nice.\\
74 - They're more than nice.\\
75 - They're what every girl dreams of.\\
76 - But let's face it.\\
77 - Some dreams just have to die.\\
78 - Well, I'm-I'm sorry you had to settle.\\
79 - I'm not settling.\\
80 - I'm... I'm accepting.\\
81 - So you're not rich and successful like Charlie.\\
82 - So you can't take me out in limos\\
83 - and shower me in diamonds.\\
84 - So there's no expensive restaurants\\
85 - or beautiful dresses.\\
86 - But?\\
87 - What?\\
88 - Well, you know, I can't take you out,\\
89 - and I can't give you stuff, but...\\
90 - But... I love you?\\
91 - Why?\\
92 - Boy, you're just gonna keep pushing this, aren't you?\\
93 - No, no. You love me. I'm good.\\
94 - Let's play Scrabble.\\
95 - Mm.\\
96 - Ooh, axolotl!\\

103 - Morning.\\
104 - Morning.\\
105 - Pottery Barn?\\
106 - Yeah, I'm looking for ideas\\
107 - for a birthday present for Lyndsey.\\
108 - At the Pottery Barn?\\
109 - Well, I don't have your money.\\
110 - And there are ways to communicate your feelings\\
111 - for a woman besides throwing diamonds at her.\\
112 - True, but diamonds get you limo skull.\\
113 - Pottery Barn won't get you dry humped\\
114 - in the back of a city bus.\\
115 - Charming.\\
116 - So, uh, how was the charity soir  e last night?\\
117 - I don't know. We never made it out of the limo.\\
118 - Charlie, do you have any idea how bad you're making me look?\\
119 - Oh, buddy, that's not me.\\
120 - That's genetics and barber school haircuts.\\
121 - I'm serious. How do you think it makes me feel\\
122 - when I'm with Lyndsey, and I have to watch you\\
123 - shower Courtney with limos and diamonds?\\
124 - Huh. I never thought about that.\\
125 - I do have a solution, though.\\
126 - What's that? Move out.\\
127 - I-I'm just saying,\\
128 - I'd appreciate it if you didn't do so much\\
129 - of that stuff in front of us.\\
130 - Again, I have a solution.\\
131 - All right, all right, let's just stipulate for the record\\
132 - that you want me to move out and I'm not going anywhere, okay?\\
133 - What is it you'd have me do?\\
134 - Not enjoy the money that I earn?\\
135 - Not lavish it on the people that I love?\\
136 - Sneak around in the middle of the night giving gifts\\
137 - to my girlfriend, so you don't get your feelings hurt?\\
138 - Is that something you'd consider?\\
139 - No, but I'll tell you what I will do. Oh, what's that?\\
140 - If I should come home some night\\
141 - to find you standing on a chair with a rope around your neck\\
142 - because you can't bear another moment\\
143 - of your pathetic life,\\
144 - I give you my word, I will kick the chair.\\
145 - Ooh! Santa Claus bottle stopper.\\
146 - Only 12 dollars.\\
147 - I can get her two.\\
148 - * Men.\\
149 - Dad?\\
150 - Yeah?\\
151 - I need money.\\
152 - Join the club.\\
153 - Seriously. My clothes are getting too small.\\
154 - Jake, I give your mother money every month\\
155 - for the express purpose of buying you whatever you need.\\
156 - Yeah, well, that's not how she sees it.\\
157 - I don't know what to tell you, buddy.\\
158 - Things are a little tight right now.\\
159 - So are my shoes.\\
160 - What do you want me to do, tap into your college fund?\\
161 - I guess not.\\
162 - Hang on a second.\\
163 - Let's not throw that idea out so quickly.\\
164 - What do you mean?\\
165 - Well, realistically,\\
166 - do you actually see yourself going to college?\\
167 - Because if you don't,\\
168 - we could use that money to buy you some new clothes,\\
169 - plus maybe some other things.\\
170 - You know, it's funny that you ask that.\\
171 - I had no interest in college until a few days ago.\\
172 - What changed?\\
173 - I saw this video called Topless Coeds of the Big Ten,\\
174 - and I decided I need to go to college.\\
175 - You expect me to pay 30, 40,000 dollars a year\\
176 - so you can meet drunk girls who lift their shirts?\\
177 - Yes, please.\\
178 - (grunts)\\
179 - Is that a no on the clothes money?\\
180 - I'll talk to your mother about it.\\
181 - Oh, now I'm filled with hope.\\
182 - CHARLIE: Hey, Alan, come here.\\
183 - Are you gonna make me feel worse?\\
184 - Is that even possible?\\
185 - I wouldn't think so, but you usually find a way.\\
186 - What do you want?\\
187 - Well, I couldn't help but overhear you trying\\
188 - to talk Huckleberry out of getting an education.\\
189 - Yeah, not my proudest moment.\\
190 - But I'm desperate to find a way\\
191 - to buy Lyndsey a decent birthday present.\\
192 - All right, here's what I'm gonna do.\\
193 - I'm gonna "lend" you enough so you can buy her something nice.\\
194 - How much are we talking about?\\
195 - Are you kidding?\\
196 - You're negotiating with me?!\\
197 - No, no, forget it.\\
198 - I appreciate the offer, but I'm not gonna take your money.\\
199 - I'm-I'm sorry. I think I might have just had a small stroke.\\
200 - I thought I heard you say you're not gonna take my money.\\
201 - Yeah, you heard me right.\\
202 - I have to find a way\\
203 - to buy Lyndsey a nice present on my own.\\
204 - It's a matter of self-respect.\\
205 - Little late for that, isn't it?\\
206 - If it was for me, I'd take your money.\\
207 - If it was for you, I wouldn't offer it.\\
208 - But this is my girlfriend.\\
209 - If I can't do this one thing for her,\\
210 - then maybe I just don't deserve her.\\
211 - Okay, what's your plan?\\
212 - I'm not sure,\\
213 - but when Alan Harper sets his mind to something,\\
214 - just stand back and watch it happen.\\
215 - Yeah, right.\\
216 - Cue the theme from Rocky.\\
217 - (Instrumental intro for Gonna Fly Now plays)\\
218 - *\\
219 - * Trying hard now\\
220 - * It's so hard now\\
221 - * Trying hard now...\\
222 - *\\
223 - * Getting strong now\\
224 - * Won't be long now\\
225 - * Getting strong now...\\
226 - (Charlie playing Rocky theme song on piano)\\
227 - (song ends)\\
228 - (Alan grumbling)\\
229 - Need some help?\\
230 - A little late to ask, don't you think?\\
231 - Nope.\\
232 - (sighs)\\
233 - Well, the good news is,\\
234 - I am done.\\
235 - I have accomplished my mission.\\
236 - After three weeks of 16-hour days\\
237 - at the office and the mall,\\
238 - I have managed to earn enough money\\
239 - to buy Lyndsey a beautiful birthday present.\\
240 - Voil  !\\
241 - A matching set of natural South Sea Island pearls.\\
242 - No kidding?\\
243 - Mm-hmm.\\
244 - And you got these at the mall?\\
245 - Uh, well, in the mall parking lot.\\
246 - Oh, Alan, you bought pearls from a guy in a parking lot?\\
247 - (groans) Not a guy.\\
248 - A Tahitian wholesaler.\\
249 - Do you have any idea what the mark-up is on these things?\\
250 - By eliminating the middleman, I saved a fortune.\\
251 - You sure about that?\\
252 - Oh, don't worry, they're real.\\
253 - I have a certificate of authenticity.\\
254 - The word "authentic" doesn't have a "K" in it.\\
255 - It's the man's second language, Charlie.\\
256 - All right, but for future reference,\\
257 - the way you can tell for sure if pearls are real\\
258 - is you rub them on your teeth.\\
259 - If they're rough, they're real,\\
260 - if they're smooth, they're fake.\\
261 - Well, fine, fine-- I will prove it to you.\\
262 - See?\\
263 - Mmm, rough.\\
264 - And... oddly minty.\\
265 - (crunching)\\
266 - Oh, darn.\\
267 - * Men...\\
268 - * Men...\\
269 - Morning.\\
270 - Morning. Hey, nice pearls.\\
271 - Found them in the garbage.\\
272 - Strange some of the things people throw away.\\
273 - I also found what looked like a half-written suicide note\\
274 - in your brother's handwriting.\\
275 - No kidding?\\
276 - Should I be worried?\\
277 - You mean that he won't go through with it?\\
278 - He'll be fine-- he's just having some money problems.\\
279 - Okay. But fair warning--\\
280 - he offs himself, I ain't cleaning it up.\\
281 - Who's offing themselves?\\
282 - Nobody.\\
283 - Nobody important.\\
284 - Hey, I was wondering, are you going anywhere today?\\
285 - Don't try to play me, knucklehead, just ask.\\
286 - Can I borrow your car? No.\\
287 - Come on. Dude, that's a very expensive car.\\
288 - There's no way I'm putting you behind that wheel.\\
289 - See you later, Charlie. I'm going shopping.\\
290 - Have fun. JAKE: Courtney,\\
291 - are you taking Uncle Charlie's car?\\
292 - Yeah. Why? I was just thinking maybe I could drive you.\\
293 - Save you the hassle of parking and everything.\\
294 - Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing.\\
295 - Thanks.\\
296 - See you, handsome!\\
297 - Yeah, see you, handsome.\\
298 - Wonderful.\\
299 - I just got outsmarted by Mr. Potato Head.\\
300 - * Men...\\
301 - (football game playing at low volume)\\
302 - Hey. Hey.\\
303 - I did a bad thing, Charlie.\\
304 - Uh-huh.\\
305 - A very bad thing.\\
306 - Sorry to hear it.\\
307 - I don't even want to tell you about it.\\
308 - Good. I am so ashamed...\\
309 - Okay, we both know you're gonna tell me, so just tell me.\\
310 - Well, in order to explain it,\\
311 - I have to go back a few years. Oh, please, God help me.\\
312 - Back when Judith and I were still married\\
313 - but having problems, I decided\\
314 - to try to make her happy by buying her\\
315 - a really nice pair or diamond earrings.\\
316 - You could afford diamond earrings?\\
317 - No alimony, no child support.\\
318 - It was a bountiful time.\\
319 - Uh-huh. Anyway,\\
320 - I spent a fortune on them and I wrapped them up really nice\\
321 - and took her to an expensive restaurant\\
322 - and gave them to her over cocktails.\\
323 - And?\\
324 - She said, "Thanks," ordered the lobster,\\
325 - then filed for divorce.\\
326 - At which point, I moved in with you. (sighs)\\
327 - You're right, Alan,\\
328 - that was a very bad thing.\\
329 - Oh, no, no, that was just the prologue. Oh, please, God, help me.\\
330 - So, this afternoon, I was over at Judith's\\
331 - to talk to her about using my child support payments\\
332 - to buy Jake new clothes. Yeah?\\
333 - She's against it.\\
334 - We argued, she stormed out of the room\\
335 - and left me standing there by myself\\
336 - in the house I used to own.\\
337 - Anyway, before I left, I figured I'd pee.\\
338 - I didn't really need to, but, you know,\\
339 - you got to figure with the traffic, it's a good defensiv...\\
340 - Would you please get to it!\\
341 - Al-Almost there, almost there.\\
342 - So, as I was walking down the hallway,\\
343 - I noticed that Judith's bedroom door was open,\\
344 - and... I thought about those beautiful diamond earrings\\
345 - just sitting there in her jewelry box\\
346 - and how I can't even afford to buy my girlfriend\\
347 - a birthday present.\\
348 - Let me guess.\\
349 - You peed in her jewelry box.\\
350 - Judith never even wore them, Charlie.\\
351 - You stole diamonds from your ex-wife?\\
352 - Yeah.\\
353 - Kudos!\\
354 - I don't even know how it happened.\\
355 - I mean, it was like I was in a dream,\\
356 - and my hands belonged to someone else.\\
357 - I have that same dream all the time.\\
358 - Except in mine, the hands do belong to someone else.\\
359 - I-I'm a good man, Charlie; I play by the rules.\\
360 - This isn't me.\\
361 - Sure it is. You made up your mind\\
362 - that you were gonna figure out a way\\
363 - to get Lyndsey a nice birthday present.\\
364 - The only part that isn't you is that you succeeded.\\
365 - I can't give these to Lyndsey-- they're tainted.\\
366 - I have to sneak them back into Judith's jewelry box.\\
367 - Aw, you can't do that. Why not?\\
368 - Don't you watch TV?\\
369 - Every time the crooks try to put the stolen loot back,\\
370 - it always goes horribly, and hilariously, wrong.\\
371 - I will just have to take that chance.\\
372 - Tomorrow I am going back to Judith's,\\
373 - and I'm gonna make this right.\\
374 - Suit yourself.\\
375 - (football game playing at low volume)\\
376 - I don't suppose you want to come with me?\\
377 - Maybe distract her while I put the earrings back?\\
378 - Yeah, that sounds like a great plan.\\
379 - What could go wrong?\\
380 - Okay, I'll do it myself.\\
381 - Don't call me for bail money.\\
382 - Why not? You were gonna give me money to buy a present.\\
383 - You're not even planning to get away with it?\\
384 - Well, of course I am.\\
385 - I was always planning to become an astronaut and a cowboy.\\
386 - * Men...\\
387 - Hey, baby. (chuckles): Hey!\\
388 - How was shopping? Oh, we had a great time.\\
389 - Yeah, it was a blast.\\
390 - Look-- I got the same watch Johnny Depp has.\\
391 - Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.\\
392 - You-you bought him all this?\\
393 - Well, he was so helpful.\\
394 - Here you go, handsome.\\
395 - Oh, by they way, you got a parking ticket.\\
396 - Damn it, Courtney, I don't want you\\
397 - buying stuff for that clown on my credit card.\\
398 - Why not? You buy me stuff.\\
399 - There's a difference.\\
400 - What's that?\\
401 - Well, you're having sex with me,\\
402 - and he's... well, he's just screwing me.\\
403 - (Jake chuckles evilly)\\
404 - * Men...\\
405 - You okay, honey?\\
406 - Oh, yeah, yeah.\\
407 - I'm-I'm just a little tired.\\
408 - Oh, of course you are.\\
409 - You've been working so hard. Mm-hmm.\\
410 - I got a little something for you.\\
411 - Oh, Lyndsey, not tonight-- I'm dead from the waist down.\\
412 - Silly! Not that.\\
413 - This.\\
414 - Oh. What is it?\\
415 - Open it and see.\\
416 - "A day of pampering at the Beverly Glen Spa"?\\
417 - You can get a massage, scalp treatment, facial,\\
418 - mani-pedi, anything you want.\\
419 - What's the occasion?\\
420 - You're my man-- you deserve it.\\
421 - Oh, boy.\\
422 - What's the matter?\\
423 - Well, your birthday's on Saturday.\\
424 - Alan... I told you, I don't expect\\
425 - anything fancy or expensive.\\
426 - I know you don't.\\
427 - (laughs softly)\\
428 - Which is why I got you these!\\
429 - (gasps)\\
430 - You shouldn't have!\\
431 - Tell me about it. (nervous chuckle)\\
432 - They must have cost a fortune!\\
433 - (laughs) Oh, not really.\\
434 - I stole 'em.\\
435 - (both laughing)\\
436 - * Men...\\
437 - Oh. To my birthday girl.\\
438 - Thank you, sweetie.\\
439 - How do they look? Almost as beautiful as the woman who's wearing them.\\
440 - Oh, Alan (laughs)\\
441 - Hey, hey, hey.\\
442 - Judith. Judith, Herb.\\
443 - (laughs) Um, what a surprise.\\
444 - What brings you here?\\
445 - It's our, uh, weekly in-lieu-of-sex dinner.\\
446 - Herb!\\
447 - Oopsy.\\
448 - Hi, Lyndsey. How have you been?\\
449 - Good, thanks.\\
450 - Uh, how about you?\\
451 - Fine.\\
452 - Alan, what is wrong with you?\\
453 - Oh, nothing. I'm, uh, I'm just...\\
454 - here with my girlfriend having a little, uh,\\
455 - a little birthday celebration, you know.\\
456 - What are you doing?!\\
457 - Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I just, I love it\\
458 - when your hair is down-- it's so sexy. You know?\\
459 - He's right, it is.\\
460 - Would you like to join us for a drink?\\
461 - Great idea!\\
462 - Uh, so, Lyndsey, uh, happy birthday.\\
463 - Thank you. Did you get anything special?\\
464 - LYNDSEY: Well, as a matter of fact...\\
465 - All right, I just have to say something here!\\
466 - You-you whine and moan about\\
467 - not having enough money to buy decent clothes\\
468 - for our son, and yet... somehow there's enough\\
469 - for you go out and have a... a big fancy dinner!\\
470 - What?\\
471 - Oh, oh, oh, oh,\\
472 - are you suddenly hard of hearing?\\
473 - Or are you just... allergic to the truth?!\\
474 - Oh, hey, hold on...\\
475 - No, no, no, no! This needs to be said!\\
476 - You should be ashamed of yourself!\\
477 - Shame! Shame, shame...\\
478 - Shame.\\
479 - Come on, Herb. He's crazy.\\
480 - Happy birthday, Lyndsey.\\
481 - I love the earrings. JUDITH: Herb!\\
482 - Coming.\\
483 - Can you believe I was married to that bitch?\\
484 - * Men...\\
485 - Hey. Hey.\\
486 - Where have you been?\\
487 - Oh, I was, uh, dropping Jake off at his mother's.\\
488 - How are you handling your guilt?\\
489 - Oh, you mean about the earrings?\\
490 - Well, interesting thing.\\
491 - It's much easier the second time.
\subsection {Episode 12: Chocolate Diddlers or My Puppy's Dead}
1 - * Men.\\
2 - I hope you don't mind, I used your toothbrush.\\
3 - No problem.\\
4 - Where'd you use it?\\
5 - Nowhere your mouth hasn't been.\\
6 - You are so beautiful.\\
7 - Thank you.\\
8 - Your-your hair. Your-your eyes.\\
9 - They're just amazing.\\
10 - Charlie.\\
11 - And this body-- it's just perfect.\\
12 - Thank you.\\
13 - So...\\
14 - why don't I want to have sex with you anymore?\\
15 - You don't?\\
16 - I'm sorry.\\
17 - No, no, no. It's okay.\\
18 - I don't want to have sex with you, either.\\
19 - Oh, thank God.\\
20 - I was feeling so guilty.\\
21 - Me, too!\\
22 - When did you know it was over?\\
23 - Ah, about two weeks ago.\\
24 - Remember? Alan took Jake to the movies,\\
25 - and we did it on the deck.\\
26 - All I could think about\\
27 - was picking up the champagne bottle\\
28 - and caving in your skull.\\
29 - Were you angry with me?\\
30 - No, no. It was more just a way to kill time.\\
31 - You know, fantasizing if I could get away with it.\\
32 - Interesting.\\
33 - I fantasized about you having a heart attack\\
34 - or getting hit by a bus.\\
35 - That way, I wouldn't be a suspect,\\
36 - and people would feel sorry for me.\\
37 - Smart.\\
38 - So, when did you know?\\
39 - It was in the limo, wasn't it?\\
40 - Yep. Yeah.\\
41 - I could tell your attention was wandering.\\
42 - Every time I looked up, you were somewhere else.\\
43 - I hate to say it,\\
44 - but I was making believe you were another woman.\\
45 - Well, that doesn't necessarily mean it's over.\\
46 - I pretended you were the big blue chick from Avatar.\\
47 - It's over.\\
48 - So, what do we do now?\\
49 - Part friends, I guess.\\
50 - I'd like that.\\
51 - It's getting kind of late.\\
52 - You're welcome to spend the night.\\
53 - Oh, that's very sweet,\\
54 - but I want to get as far away from you as I can.\\
55 - That's okay. I just got Avatar on DVD.\\
56 - So, we're all good?\\
57 - Absolutely.\\
58 - All right. I'll go get dressed.\\
59 - (farts loudly)\\
60 - You couldn't wait till I'm gone?\\
61 - Didn't seem to be any point.\\

70 - Morning.\\
71 - Morning.\\
72 - Online poker?\\
73 - Live girl-on-girl porn.\\
74 - Really? At 7:00 a.m.?\\
75 - It's not 7:00 a.m. in Copenhagen.\\
76 - How can you tell? There's no windows.\\
77 - Well, me, I like to start my day with a cup of coffee.\\
78 - Instant energy, and it helps me poop.\\
79 - Mm, mm, mm.\\
80 - Somebody's having the breakfast of champions.\\
81 - They say it's the most important meal of the day.\\
82 - Oh, please tell me Courtney isn't up in your bedroom\\
83 - while you're looking at this stuff.\\
84 - Courtney went home. We broke up.\\
85 - Oh. And you're trying to fill the void\\
86 - and mend your broken heart at DanishMunchers.com.\\
87 - Yeah. Something like that.\\
88 - So, what happened?\\
89 - Nothing happened. It just ran its course.\\
90 - Wow, that's hard to imagine.\\
91 - She's so hot.\\
92 - Let me tell you something, Alan.\\
93 - For every gorgeous woman in the world,\\
94 - there's a guy out there who's tired of banging her.\\
95 - But that guy's never me.\\
96 - I got to get out of the house.\\
97 - Maybe go to the movies. Is Jake here?\\
98 - Uh, no. He's having a party\\
99 - over at his mom's house tonight.\\
100 - Oh, damn. Did I forget his birthday?\\
101 - Oh, no, no, no. It's just one of those teenage parties.\\
102 - Uh, but for the record, his birthday was six months ago,\\
103 - and yes, you did forget it.\\
104 - Oh, man.\\
105 - How old was he?\\
106 - Sixteen.\\
107 - Huh.\\
108 - No wonder he keeps asking to borrow my car.\\
109 - I guess I'll just go to the movies by myself.\\
110 - You want some company?\\
111 - Hello? That's why I was asking about Jake.\\
112 - Good morning, ladies.\\
113 - CHARLIE: No masturbating in the kitchen!\\
114 - What do you say we go someplace a little quieter?\\
115 - * Men.\\
116 - (playing note)\\
117 - Hey, what ya working on?\\
118 - It's a jingle\\
119 - for a new kids' breakfast cereal.\\
120 - Oh, cool. Can I hear it?\\
121 - I guess.\\
122 - Picture this over animated dancing monkeys and zebras.\\
123 - Got it.\\
124 - (playing dark, dramatic tune)\\
125 - * Start your day with a big hooray *\\
126 - * Chocolate Diddlers\\
127 - * Chocolate Diddlers\\
128 - * Bowl of fun for everyone\\
129 - * Chocolate Diddlers, Chocolate Diddlers *\\
130 - * Yum.\\
131 - Uh...\\
132 - Well, I like the lyric.\\
133 - Uh, you know, it's kind of...\\
134 - It's upbeat, uh, celebratory.\\
135 - You know, "hooray, fun, yum."\\
136 - Um, if I had a note...\\
137 - uh, it would be the music.\\
138 - What about it?\\
139 - Uh, well, it doesn't say, "Yummy breakfast treat"\\
140 - so much as it says, "My puppy's dead."\\
141 - (sighs)\\
142 - Yeah, I've been a little down lately.\\
143 - I know. I know. But, uh... but keep workin' on it.\\
144 - Okay.\\
145 - Well, I'm off.\\
146 - Where you going?\\
147 - Uh, to have drinks with Lyndsey and a few of her friends.\\
148 - Have a good time.\\
149 - You know, you're welcome to tag along.\\
150 - I mean, a couple of these women are divorced,\\
151 - and got a few miles on 'em, but they've been liposucked\\
152 - to within an inch of their lives, so they present well.\\
153 - That's okay, I got to work.\\
154 - You sure? For somebody like you,\\
155 - it'd be shooting fish in a barrel.\\
156 - Although in this case, the fish would be 40-year-old,\\
157 - neurotic soccer moms,\\
158 - and the barrel would be a Bennigan's in Encino.\\
159 - Sounds tempting, but I'll pass.\\
160 - Okay, good night.\\
161 - (playing dark, dramatic tune)\\
162 - Honestly,\\
163 - think more bouncy.\\
164 - Happy. "I love Chocolate Diddlers, yay!"\\
165 - Got it.\\
166 - (door closes)\\
167 - Okay, bouncy, happy.\\
168 - (playing bouncy tune)\\
169 - * C is for chocolate\\
170 - * D is diabetes\\
171 - * Do your kids a favor\\
172 - * Buy a box of Wheaties\\
173 - * Chocolate Diddlers, yay!\\
174 - Okay.\\
175 - That's a good day's work.\\
176 - * Men.\\
177 - Hi.\\
178 - Hi.\\
179 - Charlie.\\
180 - Veronica.\\
181 - How's life treating you, Veronica?\\
182 - Not too bad. How about you?\\
183 - Well, that depends on which answer you want.\\
184 - There's more than one?\\
185 - Well, I could give you the "Everything's hunky-dory.\\
186 - "I live at the beach, drive a nice car,\\
187 - and have a python in my pants" answer.\\
188 - Or I could tell you the truth.\\
189 - You have an inchworm in your pants?\\
190 - No, the python part's true.\\
191 - Okay, so what is wrong with Charlie?\\
192 - All right, fine. I'll tell you.\\
193 - Two bourbons, straight up.\\
194 - You want anything?\\
195 - I'm good.\\
196 - I'll spare you the details of my selfish, narcissistic,\\
197 - soul-sucking mother,\\
198 - my deadbeat, oddly effeminate brother,\\
199 - and the future organ donor we call my nephew.\\
200 - Okay.\\
201 - And just to bring you up to speed\\
202 - on my recent romantic adventures,\\
203 - about this time last year, I was engaged\\
204 - to the greatest gal I'd ever met.\\
205 - Uh-huh.\\
206 - So, what went wrong?\\
207 - Hard to pinpoint.\\
208 - It could've been my-my drinking,\\
209 - my compulsive gambling...\\
210 - Or it could've been me sleeping with her best friend.\\
211 - I can see why it'd be hard to pinpoint.\\
212 - I know, right?\\
213 - So, anyway,\\
214 - she dumped me for a nice guy,\\
215 - but I got right back on the horse\\
216 - and married a drug-addled stripper.\\
217 - And that didn't work out?\\
218 - Not for the reasons you'd think.\\
219 - She was already married.\\
220 - Whoops.\\
221 - So I figured maybe I'd take a break for a while\\
222 - from the dating and just see hookers.\\
223 - Sure.\\
224 - Yeah, I'm aware of the social stigma,\\
225 - but I like to think of prostitution\\
226 - as trickle-down economics.\\
227 - Actually, it's all kind of trickle-down.\\
228 - It's very Republican, when you think about it.\\
229 - Uh-huh.\\
230 - You know what? I will have another drink.\\
231 - So anyway, I take the moral high ground\\
232 - and try to break up with the 47-year-old,\\
233 - so I won't be tempted to hit on her hot, 20-year-old daughter.\\
234 - Laudable.\\
235 - But surprise, surprise,\\
236 - Mom breaks up with me first\\
237 - 'cause she finds out I still have feelings\\
238 - for this crazy broad that stalks me.\\
239 - Next thing I know, my ex-girlfriend\\
240 - gets out of prison, I'm right in the middle of...\\
241 - Can I stop you a sec?\\
242 - Sure.\\
243 - Thank you.\\
244 - For what?\\
245 - I came in here tonight\\
246 - because I was angry at my pig of a boyfriend.\\
247 - But after listening to you,\\
248 - I realize I was unfair to him.\\
249 - There's something below "pig."\\
250 - Okay. Well, I'm glad I could help.\\
251 - How's life treating you?\\
252 - In what universe did I not hear everything you just said?\\
253 - Nobody likes an eavesdropper.\\
254 - * Men.\\
255 - (music playing)\\
256 - Dude, your party is a total sausage fest.\\
257 - Hey, you're the one who said,\\
258 - "Let's not invite the girls we know.\\
259 - Let's meet new girls."\\
260 - Exactly. So did you invite them?\\
261 - Who? The girls we don't know.\\
262 - Dude, how can I invite them if I don't know them?\\
263 - Good point, dude.\\
264 - Guess who brought beer!\\
265 - Oh, God.\\
266 - Wow. This is a total sausage fest.\\
267 - Told you, dude.\\
268 - Hey, gang, there's hot quesadillas in the kitchen.\\
269 - Charlie? What the hell are you doing here?\\
270 - Well, I heard Jake was having a party.\\
271 - I thought I'd stop by.\\
272 - To hang out with a bunch of teenagers?\\
273 - Yeah, that occurred to me.\\
274 - The cabdriver thought it was a good idea.\\
275 - And it's a really long drive.\\
276 - There's something seriously wrong with you.\\
277 - Get help.\\
278 - First I got to get another cab.\\
279 - Taxi!\\
280 - It was nice of him to bring beer.\\
281 - He's a crazy bastard, but he's got good manners.\\
282 - CHARLIE: Taxi!\\
283 - * Men.\\
284 - (loud knocking)\\
285 - CHARLIE: Knock, knock!\\
286 - Not a good time!\\
287 - (slurring): Alan, you're supposed to say, "Who's there?"\\
288 - That's okay, I'll say it.\\
289 - Who's there?\\
290 - Go away, Charlie.\\
291 - (door opens)\\
292 - Go away Charlie who?\\
293 - I am very sorry.\\
294 - What do you want?\\
295 - I just wanted to give you a heads-up\\
296 - that your ex-wife's gonna be calling you in the morning,\\
297 - and it's not gonna be a pretty call.\\
298 - Hi, Lyndsey.\\
299 - Hi, Charlie.\\
300 - You're a saint for having sex with my brother.\\
301 - Okay.\\
302 - Good night.\\
303 - No, really...\\
304 - it's like taking a bird with a-a busted wing\\
305 - and putting him in a shoebox\\
306 - and feeding him with an eyedropper.\\
307 - You know he's never gonna fly, but you give it your best shot.\\
308 - Alan's the bird.\\
309 - What are you doing?\\
310 - Just resting.\\
311 - Your brother needs help.\\
312 - I know.\\
313 - And-and for the record, I believe I will fly again.\\
314 - * Men.\\
315 - * Men.\\
316 - What do you want me to do, Judith?\\
317 - He's a drunk with a lot of money--\\
318 - you can't control people like that.\\
319 - The best you can do is stay on their good side\\
320 - so you can inherit their house after they crap out their liver.\\
321 - As a matter of fact, I have given it a lot of thought.\\
322 - Oh, oh, fine, I will talk to him about it.\\
323 - Okay, okay, bye.\\
324 - Still think you're getting the house, huh?\\
325 - What? Not important.\\
326 - CHARLIE: Alan?\\
327 - Yeah?\\
328 - Why did I wake up in your bed?\\
329 - You passed out there.\\
330 - Did we break any biblical laws?\\
331 - No. Uh, Lyndsey and I went up to your room.\\
332 - Ew, gross.\\
333 - Did you have sex in my bed?\\
334 - No. Actually, the romance of the evening\\
335 - pretty much evaporated after you curled up at our feet\\
336 - like a drunken Labrador.\\
337 - Well, that's good.\\
338 - Let's play it safe and take those sheets out of rotation.\\
339 - Uh, just to put it on the record,\\
340 - I'm officially telling you, on behalf of my ex-wife,\\
341 - don't ever do that again.\\
342 - Don't ever do what again?\\
343 - Doesn't matter-- I've fulfilled my obligation.\\
344 - You know, Alan,\\
345 - I'm starting to think I'm not living up to my full potential.\\
346 - Really?\\
347 - You think you can hump and drink even more?\\
348 - No.\\
349 - Well, maybe.\\
350 - The thing is, I woke up this morning\\
351 - and there were these little voices in my head\\
352 - telling me to get help.\\
353 - Get help.\\
354 - LYNDSEY: Your brother needs help.\\
355 - ALAN: I will fly again.\\
356 - Better I realize it\\
357 - before somebody has to point it out, huh?\\
358 - Mm-hmm, no doubt.\\
359 - So, what are you gonna do with this newfound insight?\\
360 - Well, I think it might be time to go back to my shrink.\\
361 - Mm. Talk about your issues.\\
362 - Renew my prescriptions.\\
363 - Much more in character.\\
364 - * Men.\\
365 - (door opens)\\
366 - Come on in, Charlie.\\
367 - Thanks.\\
368 - Well, it's been a while.\\
369 - How you doing?\\
370 - Good. Good.\\
371 - Really? You usually only come to see me when your hair's on fire\\
372 - and someone's chasing you with gasoline.\\
373 - (chuckles) That almost happened to me once.\\
374 - Thank God I was able to pee on the matches.\\
375 - So, what's going on?\\
376 - Well, I just recently broke up with this terrific gal,\\
377 - and I guess I've been in kind of an emotional tailspin.\\
378 - Mm-hmm. Been drinking heavier than usual?\\
379 - Just the occasional glass of wine with dinner.\\
380 - Uh-huh. And how many dinners have you had today?\\
381 - Three.\\
382 - So far.\\
383 - Okay. Go on.\\
384 - And it's not just this breakup.\\
385 - For the last couple of years, I've been trying really hard\\
386 - to have a meaningful relationship.\\
387 - You know, as opposed to picking up\\
388 - some pretty little thing for a quick bag, shag and skedaddle.\\
389 - "Bag, shag and skedaddle."\\
390 - That's charming.\\
391 - Anyway, no matter how hard I try to have something more lasting,\\
392 - more meaningful, the end result is always the same.\\
393 - At some point, I got to consider the possibility\\
394 - that the problem might be me.\\
395 - That's not a bad instinct.\\
396 - I mean, if I'm doing something wrong with all these women,\\
397 - it'd probably be helpful if I had a clue what it was.\\
398 - Well, if you had to guess,\\
399 - what would you say you're doing wrong?\\
400 - I don't know.\\
401 - I love too much?\\
402 - Guess again.\\
403 - I'm afraid of intimacy?\\
404 - Do you believe that to be true?\\
405 - Not really. I just hear it all the time.\\
406 - Dr. Phil, movies, TV shows, ex-girlfriends.\\
407 - Let me ask you something.\\
408 - What do you think being truly intimate with a woman is?\\
409 - Uh...\\
410 - not using a condom?\\
411 - Wow.\\
412 - What?\\
413 - I'm sorry.\\
414 - I-I didn't expect that.\\
415 - But what I'm trying to point you to\\
416 - is the kind of intimacy where you feel safe enough\\
417 - to be completely honest with a woman,\\
418 - to tell her how you really feel.\\
419 - Oh, come on! Nobody cares how you really feel.\\
420 - And what's a guy like me feel anyway?\\
421 - I'll tell you--\\
422 - tired, hungry, horny, hungover, happy, sad and pissed off.\\
423 - And sad and pissed off only come into play\\
424 - because I'm horny, hungry, hungover and tired.\\
425 - You know what?\\
426 - Let's table the intimacy discussion for the moment\\
427 - and talk about your other relationships.\\
428 - What other relationships?\\
429 - Well, if I recall, we've spoken at great length\\
430 - about your feelings towards your mother,\\
431 - your brother and your nephew.\\
432 - Pissed off, pissed off, sad.\\
433 - Sure.\\
434 - How about non-familial relationships?\\
435 - What, you mean like friends? Yes.\\
436 - Then why don't you just say friends? I've got the diplomas, Charlie.\\
437 - I like to use them.\\
438 - Okay, well, the answer to your question is, uh...\\
439 - I don't really have that many friends.\\
440 - Well, how many friends would you say you have?\\
441 - You know, I'm starting to feel a little pissed off right now.\\
442 - Do you have any friends, Charlie?\\
443 - Oh, come on. I'm a grown man. I have acquaintances.\\
444 - Do you spend time with these acquaintances?\\
445 - For what? To talk about my feelings?\\
446 - I'm not one to indulge in a lot of chitchat\\
447 - unless I feel like it's gonna get me laid.\\
448 - I'm just saying it might be nice to have some relationships\\
449 - in your life that aren't based solely\\
450 - on you trying to get someone into bed.\\
451 - You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?\\
452 - Not a clue.\\
453 - Okay, now I'm pissed off and sad.\\
454 - Maybe you didn't have enough dinner.\\
455 - * Men.\\
456 - Thank you.\\
457 - Are you sure you should be drinking\\
458 - if you're on medication?\\
459 - Nah, she wouldn't give me anything.\\
460 - Said I'd abuse it.\\
461 - Where does that come from?\\
462 - One more.\\
463 - So, uh, did you get anything out of the session?\\
464 - Not really. She kept saying I need\\
465 - to develop relationships that aren't about sex.\\
466 - You know, I can see the wisdom in that.\\
467 - Well, sure you can. You didn't get laid\\
468 - the last nine years of a 12-year marriage.\\
469 - Not true.\\
470 - There were birthdays.\\
471 - Let's pretend for a second the shrink is right.\\
472 - What am I supposed to do?\\
473 - Just somehow go out and make new guy friends?\\
474 - Who does that?\\
475 - Couldn't hurt to try.\\
476 - Hey, there. How are you?\\
477 - Good. You?\\
478 - I've already lost interest.\\
479 - Well, I can't fault you for trying.\\
480 - I mean, I'm not against having a friend in theory,\\
481 - but I'm a 43-year-old man who's kind of set in his ways.\\
482 - Where am I supposed to go meet this new buddy?\\
483 - Did you consider you could have a woman as a friend?\\
484 - Alan, have you not been listening?\\
485 - She said no sex.\\
486 - Well, if it makes you feel any better,\\
487 - I don't have many friends, either.\\
488 - You don't have any friends.\\
489 - Yeah, well, neither do you.\\
490 - But that's my choice.\\
491 - You-- you're just a social pariah.\\
492 - And you're a malignancy on the ass of mankind.\\
493 - So, you want to pick up a pizza on the way home?\\
494 - Pizza, really?\\
495 - Fine, what do you want?\\
496 - Um, I was thinking Chinese.\\
497 - We just had Chinese. How about ribs?\\
498 - Oh, great, but I'm a little low on cash.\\
499 - What's "a little low" mean?\\
500 - Nothing.\\
501 - All right, fine, I'll buy, but I get to pick the movie.\\
502 - Oh, we don't have to watch a movie-- I TiVo'd Glee.\\
503 - Terrific. I'm alone and miserable,\\
504 - and you want to torture me with hot chicks\\
505 - in cheerleading outfits.\\
506 - Singing hot chicks. It's Wang Chung week.\\
507 - For God's sake, Alan.\\
508 - Why don't you just put on a pair of ass-less chaps\\
509 - and get it over with?\\
510 - I'm not gay, I'm metrosexual.\\
511 - That's just a gay man who can't get laid.\\
512 - * Men.\\
513 - * Everybody Wang Chung tonight\\
514 - The tall blonde chick in the red tracksuit\\
515 - is really starting to freak me out.\\
516 - (singing along with TV): * Everybody Wang Chung tonight\\
517 - * Everybody have fun\\
518 - MERCEDES: * Deep in the world tonight...\\
519 - I love Mercedes. You go, girl!
\subsection {Episode 13: Skunk, Dog, Crap and Ketchup}
1 - * Men.\\
2 - No... No, Charlie.\\
3 - It's mine.\\
4 - What?\\
5 - Give it back.\\
6 - Ow!\\
7 - Mom! Charlie hit me!\\
8 - Oh, okay.\\
9 - Consuela, Charlie hit me.\\
10 - Ow!\\
11 - Mom, Consuela hit me.\\
12 - God. Here we go again.\\
13 - I'll run away, then you'll be sorry.\\
14 - Ow! Mom, Charlie's making me hit myself.\\
15 - Hey. What are you doing up?\\
16 - Your brother's talking in his sleep again.\\
17 - No kidding. what about?\\
18 - Some childhood dream about you making him hit himself.\\
19 - What childhood? That was last week.\\
20 - Sports Center?\\
21 - Yeah. I'm making my picks for tomorrow's games.\\
22 - Really, Charlie?\\
23 - Taking the points against Georgetown?\\
24 - No.\\
25 - If you want to throw your money away,\\
26 - why don't you just get married without a prenup.\\
27 - You know something I don't?\\
28 - So far this year, Georgetown's covered the spread\\
29 - eight times out of ten.\\
30 - Wow, you bet college basketball?\\
31 - Only idiots bet college basketball.\\
32 - No offense.\\
33 - Then how do you know all this stuff?\\
34 - I worked for a sports book in Vegas.\\
35 - Then I opened my own little business\\
36 - in the back of a candle shop in Sherman Oaks.\\
37 - I always wondered how those places stayed in business.\\
38 - Yeah, so did the IRS.\\
39 - So they nailed you for running a book?\\
40 - No. They nailed me for running a candle store\\
41 - that made a quarter of a million dollars a year\\
42 - without selling one freakin' candle.\\
43 - Okay, so no on Georgetown.\\
44 - Does Alan know about this?\\
45 - He knows about the candle store.\\
46 - Let's just keep the other part between us.\\
47 - Yeah, he's kind of prissy about moral stuff like gambling.\\
48 - Yeah, he is.\\
49 - And drinking.\\
50 - Well, that's only because when he drinks,\\
51 - he gets all weepy and then he pukes.\\
52 - And whoring.\\
53 - No, he doesn't have a moral problem with that.\\
54 - He's just cheap and he likes to cuddle.\\
55 - Well, don't worry-- your sordid gambling past will be our secret.\\
56 - I'm glad to know I can trust you. Well, of course you can.\\
57 - Hey, I never told him about your little soft-core film career.\\
58 - Oh, God.\\
59 - You saw Cinnamon's Buns?\\
60 - Not all the way through.\\
61 - Although I am very familiar with\\
62 - the bakery shop scene in the middle.\\
63 - You know, with the frosting gun?\\
64 - I was 19, I needed the money.\\
65 - They promised me it would be tasteful.\\
66 - It looked very tasteful.\\
67 - And delicious.\\
68 - Yum, yum.\\
69 - Glad to hear you enjoyed it.\\
70 - Oh, yeah. Although I don't think you were well-served\\
71 - by the screenplay.\\
72 - What screenplay?\\
73 - There was just a greasy little guy behind the camera\\
74 - saying, "Do this, do that. More frosting."\\
75 - It's kind of weird. In some way,\\
76 - you and I have more in common than you and my brother.\\
77 - All right, let's take something off the table right away.\\
78 - What's that? My ass.\\
79 - That's not what I was getting at...\\
80 - Seriously, Charlie, in spite of my past,\\
81 - I'm just a nice little Valley soccer mom now.\\
82 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, soccer mom?\\
83 - Your kid's a babbling pothead.\\
84 - He played soccer when he was ten.\\
85 - He scored two goals.\\
86 - In one game?\\
87 - In one season. Shut up.\\
88 - The point is,\\
89 - I am way past guys like you.\\
90 - What do you mean guys like me?\\
91 - I mean guys that I have to dip in ammonia\\
92 - before I'd let them anywhere near me.\\
93 - Oh. Those guys.\\
94 - Well, as long as we're being honest,\\
95 - I'm perfectly happy with the way things are between us.\\
96 - Besides, you're really good for Alan.\\
97 - Thank you. Yeah, yeah, no,\\
98 - y-you're, you're smart, you're strong,\\
99 - you're self-sufficient, and he's, well... not.\\
100 - I think you underestimate your brother.\\
101 - It's not an estimate. I already got the bill.\\
102 - You'll see, one of these days he's gonna surprise you.\\
103 - And one of these days I'm gonna die of liver failure.\\
104 - Want to lay odds which happens first?\\
105 - (laughing)\\
106 - Good night, Charlie. Good night.\\
107 - Ammonia?\\
108 - Am I that skeevy?\\
109 - Yes.\\
110 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
111 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
112 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
113 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
114 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
115 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
116 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
117 - * Men.\\
118 - Morning. Morning.\\
119 - Did Lyndsey leave yet?\\
120 - No. Why?\\
121 - No reason. Just trying to keep track of who's in my house.\\
122 - Don't worry, she's leaving very soon.\\
123 - I'm not worried.\\
124 - You not so much.\\
125 - Thank you.\\
126 - That never ceases to be funny.\\
127 - Ah, cinnamon buns!\\
128 - How did you know?\\
129 - I bought them.\\
130 - Oh, right, cinnamon buns.\\
131 - Who doesn't love cinnamon buns?\\
132 - Charlie!\\
133 - What, what, what?\\
134 - Alan bought cinnamon buns.\\
135 - With frosting.\\
136 - Oh.\\
137 - Yum.\\
138 - All right, honey.\\
139 - I'll see you later.\\
140 - Oh. I'll call you after work.\\
141 - See ya, Charlie.\\
142 - Hey, Lynds, has your son picked a college yet?\\
143 - Uh, no. Why?\\
144 - Well, I was just wondering\\
145 - if he were to choose between say...\\
146 - North Carolina and Kentucky...\\
147 - ...which one would you encourage him to pick?\\
148 - Keeping in mind that as an out-of-state resident,\\
149 - Kentucky is two-and-a-half times more expensive.\\
150 - I'd still go with Kentucky. It's a better school.\\
151 - Interesting.\\
152 - Well, I hope he gets in.\\
153 - Thanks. Bye.\\
154 - Bye.\\
155 - What was that all about? Hmm?\\
156 - Since when do you care about her kid's education?\\
157 - Young people are our future, Alan.\\
158 - I care about them all.\\
159 - Oh, please. The only young people you care about\\
160 - are sliding down a pole to grab dollar bills out of your mouth.\\
161 - Those aren't dollar bills-- those are 20s.\\
162 - And when did you become such a cynic?\\
163 - And when did you become so interested\\
164 - in the comings and goings of my girlfriend--\\
165 - or what her kid's up to?\\
166 - Whoa, whoa, chill.\\
167 - No, no, I will not chill.\\
168 - And what was all that about liking having her around?\\
169 - Nothing. I like having her around.\\
170 - Yeah, but around what?\\
171 - Excuse me?\\
172 - I think when you say "around," you mean under.\\
173 - Don't go down that road, Alan.\\
174 - Oh, oh, why shouldn't I go down that road?\\
175 - Is it slippery when wet?\\
176 - Are you out of your mind? What's gotten into you?\\
177 - Oh, I think a better question would be what's gotten into you?\\
178 - I mean, who have you gotten into?\\
179 - Alan, Alan, listen to me very carefully.\\
180 - I have not had sex with your girlfriend.\\
181 - Oh, so it's still in the planning stages.\\
182 - No. But you do want her?\\
183 - No. Why not? What's wrong with her?\\
184 - Nothing. She's terrific.\\
185 - So you do want her!\\
186 - Alan, believe me, when it comes to Lyndsey,\\
187 - you have absolutely nothing to worry about.\\
188 - Uh-huh, uh-huh. That's what you said about Wendy Freidman\\
189 - and Kathy Bell and Amy Driskell.\\
190 - Who?\\
191 - They're all girls that you stole from me.\\
192 - What are you talking about?\\
193 - I never stole anybody from you.\\
194 - (laughs) Wendy Freidman.\\
195 - Sixth grade, Halloween party.\\
196 - I went to get her punch. When I came back,\\
197 - you were bobbing for her apples.\\
198 - Innocent fun.\\
199 - Oh... Kathy Bell, ninth grade.\\
200 - I brought her home to work on our science project.\\
201 - I went to the bathroom.\\
202 - When I came back, you were teaching her French.\\
203 - Harmless horseplay.\\
204 - Amy Driskell, sophomore year.\\
205 - First girl who let me get to second base.\\
206 - All right, her I nailed.\\
207 - Wait, wait, wait. You nailed her?\\
208 - Everybody nailed her. That was her thing.\\
209 - It took me six months\\
210 - just to touch her right boob!\\
211 - Wow, you really missed the signals, didn't you?\\
212 - What signals?\\
213 - Well, in my case,\\
214 - it was her taking off her sweater\\
215 - and saying, "Quick, do me before Alan gets back\\
216 - from his trumpet lesson."\\
217 - Clarinet. I didn't have the lip for trumpet.\\
218 - Apparently, you didn't have the lip for Amy Driskell, either.\\
219 - But all that was a long time ago.\\
220 - You're with Lyndsey now, and what's important\\
221 - is that I wish you both a long and happy life together.\\
222 - Really? From the bottom of my heart.\\
223 - Okay.\\
224 - Thank you.\\
225 - You're welcome.\\
226 - Though I'd still like you to move out.\\
227 - Got it.\\
228 - Soon.\\
229 - Right.\\
230 - No, I guess that's about it.\\
231 - Amy Driskell.\\
232 - "No, Alan, I'm saving myself for Jesus."\\
233 - * Men.\\
234 - (knocking on door)\\
235 - Come on in.\\
236 - Hey.\\
237 - Wow, the place looks great.\\
238 - Doesn't it?\\
239 - Even better than before I accidentally\\
240 - almost burned it to the ground.\\
241 - Yeah.\\
242 - You're welcome.\\
243 - Come here.\\
244 - I want to give you something.\\
245 - Oh. Fooling around?\\
246 - On the new couch?\\
247 - Get your mind out of the gutter.\\
248 - I haven't Scotchgarded yet.\\
249 - Oh.\\
250 - Here.\\
251 - A house key?\\
252 - Uh-huh. For this house?\\
253 - Maybe we're not ready to move in together,\\
254 - but I want you to feel like you can come and go\\
255 - without checking in with me.\\
256 - Wow. Wow. Thank you.\\
257 - In a lot of ways, this isn't just the key to your house,\\
258 - it's the key to your heart.\\
259 - Don't gay it up.\\
260 - Now listen, I'm thinking of having\\
261 - a housewarming party next Saturday.\\
262 - Great. What can I do?\\
263 - You can help me with the guest list.\\
264 - Okay.\\
265 - What would you say about inviting\\
266 - Judith and Herb? My ex-wife?\\
267 - They live right across the street,\\
268 - and Herb is always so sweet to me.\\
269 - That's because every time Herb looks at you,\\
270 - he's pretending you're wet and naked.\\
271 - All right. Fine. I won't invite him.\\
272 - It would probably just upset Judith anyway.\\
273 - Yeah, you're right.\\
274 - You know what? Let's invite them.\\
275 - Take the high road.\\
276 - All right. What about Berta?\\
277 - Oh, no. I don't think so.\\
278 - Why not? She's kind of mean to me.\\
279 - Oh, honey.\\
280 - That's just 'cause she doesn't like you.\\
281 - Fine. Berta.\\
282 - And Jake.\\
283 - Oh, of course. Great. And Charlie.\\
284 - There it is.\\
285 - There what is?\\
286 - Charlie. Why do you want Charlie\\
287 - to come to your party?\\
288 - Why wouldn't I? When this place burned down,\\
289 - he took us in.\\
290 - He took me in seven years ago,\\
291 - and I don't feel a need to invite him.\\
292 - Oh, come on.\\
293 - He's a great guy. I really like him.\\
294 - Of course you do. All the women like Charlie.\\
295 - "All the women"?\\
296 - Wendy Freidman,\\
297 - Kathy Bell,\\
298 - Amy Driskell.\\
299 - Who?\\
300 - And now Lyndsey MacElroy.\\
301 - Oh, please.\\
302 - Charlie and I are just friends.\\
303 - Oh, no, no, no, my brother does not befriend women,\\
304 - he befouls them.\\
305 - Are you saying you don't trust me?\\
306 - Oh, no, no, no, I don't trust Charlie.\\
307 - For him, you're unexplored territory.\\
308 - At some point, he's gonna try and plant his flag in you.\\
309 - And when I say "flag," I mean his...\\
310 - ...flag.\\
311 - Okay, you're out of your mind.\\
312 - Yeah, well, be that as it may,\\
313 - I do not want you hanging out with my brother.\\
314 - I mean, you know, you can be courteous to him.\\
315 - You know, like, "Hey, Charlie,\\
316 - you got some vomit on your shoe,"\\
317 - or, you know, "Hey, Charlie, do you need me to move my car\\
318 - so your hooker can park her pink Camaro?"\\
319 - Do you realize how insulting this is?\\
320 - You don't get to tell me who I can and can't be friends with.\\
321 - Hey, it's just Charlie. I gave you Herb and Berta.\\
322 - You know what, I made a mistake.\\
323 - Well, I forgive you.\\
324 - Give me my key back.\\
325 - What? Give it to me.\\
326 - Then how can I come and go?\\
327 - You can forget coming, you're just gonna be going.\\
328 - But I-I don't understand.\\
329 - We were doing so good.\\
330 - We were, then you started talking and spoiled it.\\
331 - Okay, okay, ju-just to clarify--\\
332 - you're not as angry with me now\\
333 - as you were when I burned down your house?\\
334 - Okay, we'll talk after you've gained some perspective.\\
335 - * Men.\\
336 - * Men.\\
337 - Jake, Berta, let's go!\\
338 - Party train's leaving.\\
339 - That what you're wearing to Lyndsey's housewarming?\\
340 - I'm not going.\\
341 - Why not?\\
342 - She and I had a little argument.\\
343 - Aw, that's too bad.\\
344 - Jake, Berta, let's go!\\
345 - Charlie.\\
346 - If you do what I think\\
347 - you're gonna do, I swear to God I will never speak to you again.\\
348 - Oh, really?\\
349 - Then by all means, tell me exactly\\
350 - what you think I'm gonna do.\\
351 - You know what I'm talking about.\\
352 - All right, all right,\\
353 - I'm gonna run this down for you one last time.\\
354 - I have no interest in Lyndsey other than as a friend,\\
355 - and she has even less interest in me.\\
356 - I don't believe you.\\
357 - Okay, fine, you're right.\\
358 - I'm going over to your girlfriend's house,\\
359 - and I'm gonna do her right on the couch!\\
360 - No, you won't. Why not?\\
361 - Couch isn't Scotchgarded yet.\\
362 - Hey, Charlie, did you remember to get the housewarming gift?\\
363 - Jake's got it. Jake!\\
364 - Very funny.\\
365 - We thought so. (chuckles)\\
366 - How come you aren't dressed?\\
367 - He and Lyndsey had a fight.\\
368 - Oh. That sucks.\\
369 - See ya.\\
370 - So you're just gonna\\
371 - sit here all night?\\
372 - Oh, I'll be fine.\\
373 - Oh, I'm sure you will.\\
374 - But if you get bored, there's a load of laundry in the dryer\\
375 - you could fluff and fold.\\
376 - So you want me to do your job?\\
377 - Somebody has to.\\
378 - Well, I guess there's nothing\\
379 - left to say except you're an idiot.\\
380 - I may be an idiot, but at least I'm home by myself\\
381 - reading Moby Dick.\\
382 - Upside down.\\
383 - (dryer buzzes)\\
384 - Might as well.\\
385 - Maybe she'll like me better.\\
386 - * Men.\\
387 - Where's your friend Eldridge?\\
388 - He lives here, right?\\
389 - Yeah, he's hiding in his room.\\
390 - How come?\\
391 - He gets really paranoid when he's high...\\
392 - ...ding in his room.\\
393 - I just came to get him these snacks. Bye.\\
394 - Amateurs.\\
395 - Nice party.\\
396 - Thanks.\\
397 - So give me the lay of the land.\\
398 - You mean who in this land can you lay?\\
399 - If you will.\\
400 - All right.\\
401 - Hot redhead by the bar--\\
402 - that's Wanda.\\
403 - Recently came out of a terrible marriage.\\
404 - Nice, nice.\\
405 - What else you got?\\
406 - Pretty blonde on the couch-- that's Terry.\\
407 - She divorced her husband to be a lesbian.\\
408 - How's that working out for Terry?\\
409 - See the dirty look she's giving Wanda?\\
410 - CHARLIE: Oh.\\
411 - I think I see an opening.\\
412 - And by that you mean...?\\
413 - I wasn't being subtle; I see an opening.\\
414 - (both laugh)\\
415 - I knew it.\\
416 - Anything good in my life, you have to take it away.\\
417 - "Oh, Charlie, you're so funny and so clever.\\
418 - "Why don't I lean forward\\
419 - so you can look down my dress and see my boobies?"\\
420 - "Why, thank you, I believe I will."\\
421 - "So do you want to have sex now or wait untill after the party?"\\
422 - "You don't mind that I'm carrying most,\\
423 - if not all communicable diseases known to man?"\\
424 - "Oh, no, Charlie, that's part of your charm.\\
425 - Come, take me on the couch."\\
426 - "Are you sure? It's not Scotchgarded."\\
427 - "No matter.\\
428 - We'll Scotchgard it with our love."\\
429 - Uh...\\
430 - Hello, Mr. Skunk.\\
431 - Don't be alarmed.\\
432 - Uh, I was just leaving.\\
433 - Uh, there's, there's certainly no reason to feel threatened.\\
434 - Good skunk.\\
435 - Nice skunk.\\
436 - (grunting)\\
437 - (gagging)\\
438 - Bad skunk!\\
439 - (gagging)\\
440 - (groaning)\\
441 - Oh, God, oh, God.\\
442 - (retching)\\
443 - Oh, God, oh, God.\\
444 - Who's out there?!\\
445 - Alan?\\
446 - Hey, Herb.\\
447 - Oh! Oh, wow!\\
448 - (gagging)\\
449 - Hope you don't mind.\\
450 - I got skunked.\\
451 - Oh, you sure did. Yeah.\\
452 - How come you're not at Lyndsey's party?\\
453 - Oh, well, I wanted to,\\
454 - but Judith came down with a sudden migraine.\\
455 - And by "migraine," I mean "bitch fit."\\
456 - Got it.\\
457 - How about you?\\
458 - Oh, Lyndsey and I\\
459 - had kind of a falling-out.\\
460 - 'Cause you showed up smelling like a skunk?\\
461 - No, no. Long story.\\
462 - I got time.\\
463 - I-I think she's fooling around\\
464 - with Charlie behind my back.\\
465 - Charlie?\\
466 - That lucky duck.\\
467 - What?\\
468 - I said, that son of a bitch.\\
469 - Story of my life.\\
470 - Uh, Wendy Freidman, Kathy Bell, Amy Driskell.\\
471 - Amy Driskell?\\
472 - I lost my virginity to Amy Driskell.\\
473 - You're kidding.\\
474 - Never even had to ask.\\
475 - Aah!\\
476 - It was our first date.\\
477 - (groans)\\
478 - Never got out of the driveway.\\
479 - Aw!\\
480 - We weren't even in a car.\\
481 - Hey, you know what's good for getting rid of skunk smell?\\
482 - Tomato juice.\\
483 - Great. You got any?\\
484 - No.\\
485 - We might have some V-8.\\
486 - Think that'll work?\\
487 - Well, it sure doesn't taste\\
488 - like tomato juice,\\
489 - but you couldn't possibly smell any worse.\\
490 - Hang on.\\
491 - Oh!\\
492 - What else could go wrong?\\
493 - Of course.\\
494 - I'm standing in dog crap.\\
495 - * Men.\\
496 - I can't tell you how happy it makes me\\
497 - to bring two friends back together.\\
498 - Any better?\\
499 - Not really.\\
500 - Well, that's all the V-8.\\
501 - Want to try some ketchup?\\
502 - Why not?\\
503 - * Men.\\
504 - I found this in one of my son's shoes.\\
505 - (sniffing)\\
506 - Oh, yeah, I can get you better than this.\\
507 - That's what I was hoping.\\
508 - ALAN: Lyndsey?!\\
509 - Alan?\\
510 - What the hell are you... ?\\
511 - Whoa!\\
512 - Where is he?\\
513 - Where is who?\\
514 - What is that smell?\\
515 - Skunk, dog crap and ketchup. Oh.\\
516 - And don't try to change the subject.\\
517 - Where is my brother?!\\
518 - Well, he-he left about 20 minutes ago with two women.\\
519 - Really?\\
520 - Really.\\
521 - So-so you and he aren't... ?\\
522 - (sighs)\\
523 - That's what I've been telling you, you smelly fool!\\
524 - Wow.\\
525 - Guess we had nothing to fight about.\\
526 - (laughs)\\
527 - Hug?\\
528 - I'll call you.\\
529 - (airy laugh)\\
530 - You don't scare me.\\
531 - You already shot your load.\\
532 - (spraying)\\
533 - Although I suppose you could be a different skunk.\\
534 - * Men.\\
535 - So all I'm saying is, given my history,\\
536 - Alan's paranoia is not completely uncalled for.\\
537 - No, no, this wasn't paranoia.\\
538 - This was insanity.\\
539 - I know, I know, but... The man was covered in ketchup.\\
540 - (sighs) Well, to be fair, there was a time in your life\\
541 - when you were covered in frosting.\\
542 - It's not the same thing.\\
543 - I was putting myself through college.\\
544 - Look, all I know is that Alan really loves you.\\
545 - Now, if you ever repeat this, I will deny it,\\
546 - but my brother is about the most decent human being I know.\\
547 - Can't you just give him one more chance?\\
548 - Well, I suppose.\\
549 - (loud thud)\\
550 - I knew it!\\
551 - You bastard!\\
552 - You slut!\\
553 - So what do you say?
\subsection {Episode 14: Lookin' for Japanese Subs}
1 - ROSE: Hi, Charlie.\\
2 - You should know that I didn't come over to ruin your date.\\
3 - Really? Why did you come over?\\
4 - To tell you that I'm getting married.\\
5 - Today's the big day, huh?\\
6 - Oh, please. There's no wedding.\\
7 - Would it make a difference to you,\\
8 - knowing that cute little face\\
9 - will never pop up over that railing again?\\
10 - That the one woman who's always loved you and been there for you\\
11 - is forever out of reach?\\
12 - Come on.\\
13 - Where are we going?\\
14 - To the church. I'm going to prove to you\\
15 - that she's not getting married.\\
16 - Look. Tell me if you see a wedding.\\
17 - I see a wedding.\\
18 - OFFICIANT: Two persons present now come to be joined.\\
19 - Rose and Manfred...\\
20 - She's really doing it.\\
21 - ...let him speak now, or forever hold his peace.\\
22 - And we're clear.\\
23 - Yep, that ought to do it.\\
24 - Thanks, Freddie.\\
25 - * Men.\\
26 - Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.\\
27 - Catch a tiger...\\
28 - Oh, who am I kidding?\\
29 - I love you all.\\
30 - Let's see. What else do we need?\\
31 - Oh, right. Ice.\\
32 - Water in a useful form.\\
33 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Everybody all right?\\
34 - Charlie?\\
35 - Rose?\\
36 - What a nice surprise.\\
37 - (smooches)\\
38 - How are you? Good. Good. Good.\\
39 - You look great.\\
40 - Oh, thank you. Married life agrees with me.\\
41 - Oh, that's right. Congratulations.\\
42 - So where are you living now?\\
43 - Uh, Manny and I moved into my beach house.\\
44 - Oh, so we'll be neighbors again.\\
45 - Yeah. I'll have to come by and meet him sometime.\\
46 - I don't think that's a good idea.\\
47 - The old boyfriend meeting the new husband.\\
48 - It's a little awkward.\\
49 - Yeah, I guess you're right.\\
50 - I've never been that popular with husbands.\\
51 - Or fathers.\\
52 - Or boyfriends. Sons.\\
53 - Surly lesbian roommates.\\
54 - (sighs) So, anyway, you're happy?\\
55 - More than I ever dreamed possible.\\
56 - You know what he said to me the other day?\\
57 - Without me at his side, he might as well not exist.\\
58 - Wow. That's a little gay, but all right.\\
59 - What about you, Charlie?\\
60 - Is there anyone special in your life?\\
61 - No. Not really. I mean, there's gals with special skills,\\
62 - but I got to pay extra.\\
63 - You should find someone who loves you\\
64 - the way Manny loves me.\\
65 - The love is the same. It's just at an hourly rate.\\
66 - Don't grow old alone, Charlie.\\
67 - Right.\\
68 - Bye. Bye.\\
69 - What is it with women?\\
70 - They go off and get married,\\
71 - and all of a sudden seem a lot more beautiful.\\
72 - Ah, no matter, MacTavich. We can grow old together.\\
73 - After all, you're only 20.\\
74 - But I doubt you're gonna see 21.\\
75 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
76 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
77 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
78 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
79 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
80 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
81 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
82 - * Men.\\
83 - Is it on?\\
84 - I think so.\\
85 - All right, let's do this.\\
86 - Hi. I'm Jake Harper, and this is the Human Volcano.\\
87 - We begin by drinking a warm can of Diet Coke.\\
88 - That's not Coke, dude.\\
89 - Yeah. My dad did the shopping.\\
90 - Anyway, a warm diet cola product.\\
91 - Ah.\\
92 - And now I will swallow a Mentos.\\
93 - Mentos.\\
94 - (gags, sighs)\\
95 - Now I will lay on the floor.\\
96 - Goggles.\\
97 - Right. Safety first.\\
98 - You feel anything yet?\\
99 - Oh, yeah. It's working.\\
100 - If it starts coming out the back door,\\
101 - pull your pants down and roll over.\\
102 - Good thinking.\\
103 - ALAN: Hey, what's going on?\\
104 - Not a good time, Dad.\\
105 - What are you doing on the floor?\\
106 - (vomiting forcefully)\\
107 - Whoa! Whoa!\\
108 - Awesome!\\
109 - (spluttering)\\
110 - What the hell are you doing?\\
111 - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\\
112 - Are you all right?\\
113 - Yeah. We were just making a video. Hold on.\\
114 - (retching)\\
115 - Cool stunts.\\
116 - Cool stunts?\\
117 - In God's name, why?\\
118 - You've heard of Jackass? Yeah.\\
119 - We are Dumbass.\\
120 - Really?\\
121 - However did you come up with that name?\\
122 - Well, we were thinking "What's better than Jackass?"\\
123 - That's kind of a rhetorical question.\\
124 - No. It wasn't that hard.\\
125 - It came down to a choice\\
126 - between Dumbass and The Asskateers.\\
127 - I think you made the right call.\\
128 - Really?\\
129 - Oh, yes. I applaud your decision.\\
130 - The plan is, we shoot a bunch of cool stunts,\\
131 - post them online, and then sell advertising.\\
132 - Who on earth would advertise on that?\\
133 - Well, right off the bat, we figure Coke and Mentos.\\
134 - It's a product placement bonanza.\\
135 - Come on, let's go upload our premiere episode.\\
136 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What about this mess?\\
137 - (sighs)\\
138 - Damn it.\\
139 - I'm gonna be taking care of that kid till I'm 90.\\
140 - Please, God, don't make me live that long.\\
141 - You'll never guess who I ran into at the supermarket.\\
142 - Rose.\\
143 - Oh. She's back from her honeymoon?\\
144 - Yep, and living down the beach with her new husband.\\
145 - Ah, good for her.\\
146 - Yeah, good for her.\\
147 - You have to forget about her, Charlie.\\
148 - I know.\\
149 - That's why I got me some milk of amnesia.\\
150 - Nice.\\
151 - What are you doing down there?\\
152 - Wiping up cola vomit my son spewed in my face.\\
153 - Oh, great. The Human Volcano worked.\\
154 - You knew about this?\\
155 - It was my idea.\\
156 - You're kidding.\\
157 - Yeah. It'll make\\
158 - a great first episode of The Asskateers.\\
159 - Actually, I think they went with Dumbass.\\
160 - Oh, damn. I already had a bunch of t-shirts made up.\\
161 - What can I say?\\
162 - Well, still, you got to like that your son's got\\
163 - a little entrepreneurial spirit.\\
164 - Thanks for showing me the bright side.\\
165 - No problem.\\
166 - Memory wipe?\\
167 - I think I will.\\
168 - * Men.\\
169 - Looking for Japanese subs, Cap'n?\\
170 - What? No, I'm just trying out these new binoculars.\\
171 - You're spying on Rose, aren't you?\\
172 - It's not spying. It's...\\
173 - Shut up and leave me alone.\\
174 - You said you were going to forget her.\\
175 - And you said you were going to move out after a few days.\\
176 - Don't change the subject.\\
177 - I'm just trying to get a glimpse of her husband.\\
178 - Oh, that's really sad.\\
179 - Sadder than throwing your back out trying to pleasure yourself?\\
180 - I was doing yoga.\\
181 - Then why were you wearing lipstick?\\
182 - And again, don't change the subject.\\
183 - I am simply curious to see what kind of guy Rose would marry.\\
184 - Oh, well, if that's the case,\\
185 - why don't you just go over there, knock on the door,\\
186 - and shake the man's hand?\\
187 - What would I tell him? "Hi. I'm Charlie Harper.\\
188 - Your wife used to stalk me"?\\
189 - I might leave that part out.\\
190 - And besides, I'm sure he already knows about you.\\
191 - How would he know about me?\\
192 - Well, it's possible she told him,\\
193 - or perhaps he noticed the tattoo\\
194 - of your face on her left butt cheek.\\
195 - Yeah, I kind of wish she hadn't done that.\\
196 - After she takes a hot bath,\\
197 - I start looking like Edward James Olmos.\\
198 - Just go over, introduce yourself\\
199 - and welcome him to the neighborhood.\\
200 - Yeah, I guess you're right.\\
201 - Bring over a bottle of wine, little housewarming gift.\\
202 - Now you're talking.\\
203 - (clattering)\\
204 - JAKE and ELDRIDGE: Geronimo!\\
205 - (both screaming)\\
206 - (crashing)\\
207 - Oh, God. Are you all right?\\
208 - JAKE: Mostly.\\
209 - Did you remember to get it on video?\\
210 - ELDRIDGE: Aw, crap.\\
211 - * Men.\\
212 - (doorbell rings)\\
213 - Charlie, what are you doing here?\\
214 - I thought I'd stop by\\
215 - and welcome you guys to the neighborhood.\\
216 - No, no. This is a bad idea. Please go.\\
217 - But I thought we could open a bottle of wine\\
218 - and all get to know each other.\\
219 - Listen to me, Charlie.\\
220 - I love my husband.\\
221 - I'm building a new life with him and I won't let you ruin it.\\
222 - How could I ruin it?\\
223 - Well, he doesn't even know you exist,\\
224 - and I plan on keeping it that way.\\
225 - How is that possible? What about the tattoo?\\
226 - I added glasses to it and told him it was Harry Potter.\\
227 - Now, please get out of here.\\
228 - Okay, fine.\\
229 - I'm sorry.\\
230 - Just so I'm clear, you and I, we're...?\\
231 - Over, finished.\\
232 - Okay.\\
233 - I get it.\\
234 - Told you he'd stop by.\\
235 - * Men.\\
236 - Do you realize how lucky you are?\\
237 - You could have broken your necks.\\
238 - We took precautions.\\
239 - You flew off the roof!\\
240 - In a shopping cart!\\
241 - What precautions?\\
242 - We were planning to land in the ocean.\\
243 - You missed it by 100 yards.\\
244 - It's not an exact science, Dad.\\
245 - Okay, okay. Let's not dicker over the details.\\
246 - (both laughing)\\
247 - He said, "dicker."\\
248 - I know.\\
249 - Okay, okay. I am serious. Okay?\\
250 - This Dumbass thing stops right now.\\
251 - You're the one who told me I should follow my dreams.\\
252 - I meant dreams like "doctor" or "lawyer,"\\
253 - not "crash test dummy."\\
254 - "Dr. Jacob Harper." I like the sound of that.\\
255 - Hey, doc, what's this on my nutsack? Is it infected?\\
256 - Yes. It seems we'll have to perform a nutsackectomy.\\
257 - (both chuckling)\\
258 - Will you two quit\\
259 - with the cockamamie babble\\
260 - and focus on what I am trying to tell you?\\
261 - He said, "cockamamie."\\
262 - (both laughing)\\
263 - He said, "focus."\\
264 - (laughter)\\
265 - * Men.\\
266 - (TV plays quietly)\\
267 - Oh, what's to become of my son?\\
268 - Don't worry, Alan.\\
269 - There'll always be carnivals.\\
270 - I suppose.\\
271 - So, how'd it go with Mr. and Mrs. Manfred Quinn?\\
272 - I never met him. Rose told me to get lost.\\
273 - Wow. That's got to sting a bit.\\
274 - Yeah, but I understand.\\
275 - She's happy now, and doesn't want me screwing it up.\\
276 - You still love her, don't you?\\
277 - I guess I do.\\
278 - Funny how these things turn out, isn't it?\\
279 - I mean, eight, nine years ago,\\
280 - she was just a crazy one-night stand\\
281 - who ended up stalking you.\\
282 - All you wanted to do was get rid of her.\\
283 - But the years go by,\\
284 - and stalking turns to friendship.\\
285 - Friendship turns to love.\\
286 - But it's too late.\\
287 - She marries another man, and she's lost to you forever.\\
288 - Boy, that would make a great movie, wouldn't it?\\
289 - Yeah, great.\\
290 - Want to write it with me?\\
291 - What?! No!\\
292 - Well, don't go stealing it.\\
293 - I mean, you know,\\
294 - it's your life, but it's my idea.\\
295 - (sighs)\\
296 - Oh, how's this for a title?\\
297 - Look Who's Stalking.\\
298 - Meet the Stalkers.\\
299 - Avatart.\\
300 - Are you done?\\
301 - Yeah.\\
302 - Although I do think it has real franchise opportunities.\\
303 - Could be a sitcom.\\
304 - Maybe not on a major network, but, you know, TBS, TNT.\\
305 - I Love Looney.\\
306 - Where you going?\\
307 - I was just spitballin' here.\\
308 - (quietly chuckling)\\
309 - I said, "spitballin'."\\
310 - (quietly chuckling)\\
311 - Oh, God, I want to die.\\
312 - * Men.\\
313 - (slow, romantic music plays on TV)\\
314 - * Men.\\
315 - * Men.\\
316 - That has got to be the worst-looking toupee\\
317 - I've ever seen.\\
318 - What the hell are you doing here?!\\
319 - You scared the hell out of me.\\
320 - Are you crazy, climbing up on my deck,\\
321 - snooping around like this?!\\
322 - I need to talk to you.\\
323 - Well, I can't talk to you.\\
324 - Manny is right inside.\\
325 - I love you. It's a little late for that.\\
326 - I'm sorry. I realize now, Rose, I can't live without you.\\
327 - It doesn't matter what you realize.\\
328 - I'm married now.\\
329 - Oh, please, Rose.\\
330 - Oh, God, Charlie,\\
331 - why are you doing this to me? It's so unfair.\\
332 - I'm begging you. Just talk to me.\\
333 - (sighs)\\
334 - All right.\\
335 - Manny has to go back into the office to do some work.\\
336 - Come back in an hour. Thank you.\\
337 - But just to talk. Of course.\\
338 - And can you bring me some butter brickle ice cream? What?\\
339 - And marshmallow fluff and sprinkles. Sure, whatever you need.\\
340 - Chocolate sprinkles, not the multicolored kind.\\
341 - Fine. I don't know why they even make those.\\
342 - Okay. Okay.\\
343 - I'll see you later.\\
344 - (thudding) Ow!\\
345 - Son of a bitch! How do you do that?\\
346 - Don't lock your knees.\\
347 - (romantic music plays on TV)\\
348 - Good news, Manny.\\
349 - We're getting ice cream.\\
350 - * Men.\\
351 - You ready for some more beans?\\
352 - Bring it on.\\
353 - (clears throat)\\
354 - So, I'm thinking we call this stunt "Fart Rocket."\\
355 - Nah, I think we need to go with something more intellectual.\\
356 - How about "The Dumbass Assblaster?"\\
357 - No, you can't use two "asses" in a row.\\
358 - It's... redumbnant.\\
359 - Hey.\\
360 - What's going on?\\
361 - I'm just making Eldridge something to eat.\\
362 - Really?\\
363 - Yes, I was peckerish.\\
364 - You mean peckish.\\
365 - Fine. If you want to dicker.\\
366 - (both laughing)\\
367 - Good one, dude.\\
368 - Hey.\\
369 - What's in the bag?\\
370 - Butter brickle ice cream\\
371 - with marshmallow fluff and chocolate sprinkles.\\
372 - Oh, Charlie, no.\\
373 - What?!\\
374 - "What?!"\\
375 - Only one person on earth puts chocolate sprinkles\\
376 - and marshmallow fluff on butter brickle ice cream.\\
377 - Congratulations, Sherlock.\\
378 - You cracked the case.\\
379 - She is a married woman, Charlie.\\
380 - I can't help it. I love her.\\
381 - Oh, please. You didn't start loving her\\
382 - until you found out you couldn't have her.\\
383 - So? That doesn't make it... not love.\\
384 - But what if her husband catches you?\\
385 - Then he shoots me, and you can have my house and my car.\\
386 - Go to her, Charlie. She's waiting.\\
387 - (sighs)\\
388 - (thudding) Ow!\\
389 - Son of a bitch!\\
390 - (breaking wind)\\
391 - JAKE: Dude, don't waste it.\\
392 - Squeeze it in!\\
393 - * Men.\\
394 - (panting)\\
395 - (grunting)\\
396 - Not as easy as it looks, is it?\\
397 - No.\\
398 - Is your husband gone?\\
399 - He just left. We're alone.\\
400 - Oh, great. Wait.\\
401 - We agreed, just talking.\\
402 - Right, right, right. Just talking. Let's talk.\\
403 - Do you know what Manny said to me right before he left?\\
404 - Um... "I love you,\\
405 - "but it's okay to have an affair with Charlie,\\
406 - 'cause he's a swell guy and I'm secretly gay"?\\
407 - No.\\
408 - He said, in the whole world,\\
409 - I'm the only one who can move him.\\
410 - Like I said, gay.\\
411 - How can I betray a man like that?\\
412 - I can think of several ways.\\
413 - You on top, you on bottom, everybody facing the TV.\\
414 - Charlie.\\
415 - Who moves you, Rose? Him or me?\\
416 - I don't know. I'm confused.\\
417 - I love Manny.\\
418 - But you and I are soul mates, like Romeo and Juliet.\\
419 - Really? Did Romeo ever chew through the ropes\\
420 - holding him to a radiator in a motel outside of Bakersfield\\
421 - when Juliet was just trying to give him a birthday surprise?\\
422 - Birthday surprise? You were going to brand me.\\
423 - Branding is the new piercing, Charlie.\\
424 - Fine. Pierce me, brand me, do anything you want.\\
425 - Anything? It's just an expression.\\
426 - Give me another chance, Rose.\\
427 - No. It's wrong.\\
428 - Fine. You just say the word, and I'll go.\\
429 - Time's up.\\
430 - (sighing)\\
431 - I love you.\\
432 - I love you, too.\\
433 - You know what this means, don't you?\\
434 - I think so.\\
435 - You're going to have to kill Manny.\\
436 - What?!\\
437 - Kidding.\\
438 - Just wanted to see how far you'd go.\\
439 - * Men.\\
440 - Can I tell you something, Rose?\\
441 - Anything.\\
442 - I've never felt happier and more at peace\\
443 - than I do at this very moment.\\
444 - Who's being a little gay now?\\
445 - (phone chimes)\\
446 - Oh. It's a text from Manny.\\
447 - He's on his way home. You have to go.\\
448 - When can I see you again?\\
449 - You can't. This was a mistake.\\
450 - How can you say that?\\
451 - Charlie, I love my husband.\\
452 - Forget Manny. Run away with me.\\
453 - You don't mean that.\\
454 - I do.\\
455 - Come on, Charlie.\\
456 - If you had me to yourself,\\
457 - you'd be tired of me within a year.\\
458 - Then you can go back to Manny. Everybody wins.\\
459 - Go.\\
460 - I love you.\\
461 - Oh, aren't you the naughty boy who likes to watch?\\
462 - * Men.\\
463 - * Men.\\
464 - ELDRIDGE: Hurry up, dude.\\
465 - I'm about to blow. Hang on.\\
466 - Hi. I'm Jake Harper,\\
467 - and you're about to witness\\
468 - a little something we like to call...\\
469 - "Fumes of Fury."\\
470 - Let's do this thing. All right.\\
471 - Remember, if for some reason\\
472 - you don't reach the ocean, just tuck and roll.\\
473 - Okay, just hurry up.\\
474 - All right. Let 'er rip.\\
475 - (breaking wind, flame roaring)\\
476 - Dumbasses.\\
477 - I can't believe nothing happened.\\
478 - I wouldn't say that. I think I crapped my pants.
\subsection {Episode 15: Three Hookers and a Philly Cheesesteak}
1 - MAN: ...now come to be joined.\\
2 - Rose and Manfred...\\
3 - She's really doing it.\\
4 - CHARLIE: Rose is getting married.\\
5 - And we're clear.\\
6 - Yep. That ought to do it.\\
7 - Thanks, Freddie.\\
8 - Who moves you, Rose? Him or me?\\
9 - I love Manny.\\
10 - Fine.\\
11 - You just say the word and I'll go.\\
12 - Time's up.\\
13 - * Men.\\
14 - MAN (on TV): ...most famous teams here at Oregon...\\
15 - ALAN: Charlie, you home?\\
16 - Charlie?\\
17 - Hello?\\
18 - Didn't you hear me?\\
19 - Didn't you see me trying to hide?\\
20 - Cute.\\
21 - Okay, how would you feel if I said\\
22 - I was moving out?\\
23 - The same way Charlie Brown feels\\
24 - when Lucy offers to hold the football.\\
25 - Excited, but with a skepticism\\
26 - borne out of countless disappointments.\\
27 - (chuckling)\\
28 - I deserve that.\\
29 - But it's different this time.\\
30 - Read this.\\
31 - "A larger penis can be yours\\
32 - with a noninvasive surgical procedure."\\
33 - No, no, no, next to it. There.\\
34 - "Dr. Dave Ciambotti.\\
35 - "Orange County's number one chiropractor.\\
36 - "Mention this ad for a 20% discount\\
37 - and a free spinebuster key chain."\\
38 - What does this have to do with you moving out?\\
39 - I went to school with Dave Ciambotti.\\
40 - In fact, we were roommates.\\
41 - Say no more.\\
42 - You're finally out of the closet and shacking up with Dr. Dave.\\
43 - Congratulations, and God bless you both.\\
44 - No, no!\\
45 - It's okay, Alan. I don't judge.\\
46 - Although I'm sure old Dave could do better.\\
47 - Will you stop?\\
48 - Okay, Dave and I\\
49 - had the same education, the same skills.\\
50 - We even started our practice at the same time.\\
51 - But he does three times the business that I do.\\
52 - You know why?\\
53 - He offers happy endings?\\
54 - Target market advertising.\\
55 - Is that another way of saying happy ending?\\
56 - No, no, it means newspaper ads,\\
57 - flyers, radio spots.\\
58 - Since Dave started doing it,\\
59 - his business has been through the roof.\\
60 - How much is this going to cost me?\\
61 - No, no. The question is:\\
62 - how much is it going to earn you?\\
63 - I'll stick with my question.\\
64 - Charlie, I am willing to let you get in on the ground floor\\
65 - of an amazing business opportunity.\\
66 - Still waiting for a number, Alan.\\
67 - $5,000.\\
68 - Five grand?!\\
69 - For two, I can have you buried in the desert\\
70 - and still have three to get myself a larger penis.\\
71 - Although, to be honest,\\
72 - that would just be gilding the lily.\\
73 - Come on, Charlie, with targeted advertising\\
74 - I could double the size of my practice.\\
75 - Wow, a second patient.\\
76 - You're not listening.\\
77 - Once the profits start rolling in, I can move out.\\
78 - And once I grow boobs, I can start dancing\\
79 - the lunch shift at Les Girls, Girls, Girls.\\
80 - I'm serious. This is a chance\\
81 - that could completely turn my life around.\\
82 - Did you ask Mom for the money? Seriously?\\
83 - Nah, I'm just grasping at straws.\\
84 - So what do you say?\\
85 - (sighs)\\
86 - Okay, fine, I'll give you the five grand.\\
87 - Knowing full well that I'll never see it again,\\
88 - and wishing that it was you.\\
89 - Thank you, Charlie. Thank you so much.\\
90 - You're not going to regret this.\\
91 - You have $5,000 in your sweatpants?\\
92 - I prefer to think of it\\
93 - as three hookers and a Philly cheesesteak.\\
94 - (phone ringing)\\
95 - Hang on a sec.\\
96 - Hello.\\
97 - Oh, hey, Rose.\\
98 - Why don't I count it while you talk?\\
99 - He's gone?\\
100 - Well, great. I'll be over in five minutes with bells on.\\
101 - No, no, no, it's just a figure of speech.\\
102 - Sure, I suppose I could try to find some bells.\\
103 - Okay, I'll see you soon.\\
104 - I got to run.\\
105 - Her husband's at a meeting.\\
106 - Oh, Charlie, really? The woman's trying to build\\
107 - a new life with her husband,\\
108 - and you're going to go over there\\
109 - to have an affair with her? You want this money or not?\\
110 - Give her my best.\\
111 - Huh. That was easy money.\\
112 - Hi, Mom.\\
113 - Do you have a minute to hear about\\
114 - an amazing business opportunity?\\
115 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
116 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
117 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
118 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
119 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
120 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
121 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
122 - * Men.\\
123 - So it isn't really a favor for me\\
124 - as much as it's an opportunity for you.\\
125 - Right.\\
126 - Why don't you just ask your brother for the money?\\
127 - Well, I thought of that, but after all he's done for me,\\
128 - I'd feel horrible asking for a loan.\\
129 - And after all I've done for you?\\
130 - I still feel horrible,\\
131 - but you never threaten to smother me in my sleep.\\
132 - Not since you learned to talk anyway.\\
133 - How much?\\
134 - Well, I'm, uh, going to take out some ads in the Pennysaver,\\
135 - uh, and on local radio.\\
136 - Probably some circulars.\\
137 - Uh, maybe one of those giant compressed air guys\\
138 - with the flailing arms.\\
139 - Um, I think I'll need...\\
140 - $10,000.\\
141 - All right.\\
142 - Although I could make due... All right?!\\
143 - You're my son.\\
144 - I should at least pretend to believe in you.\\
145 - Wow. Uh, thank you.\\
146 - I'm putting American Cancer Society on the memo line.\\
147 - Just ignore that.\\
148 - No problem.\\
149 - You won't be sorry.\\
150 - You're going to get your money back plus interest.\\
151 - Of course I am.\\
152 - Never doubted it.\\
153 - Is that for luck?\\
154 - No, just kissing it good-bye.\\
155 - * Men.\\
156 - (bird call): Ba-caw! Ba-caw!\\
157 - What the hell was that?\\
158 - It was the all-clear signal, silly.\\
159 - You couldn't just say "all clear"?\\
160 - (bird call): All clear! All clear!\\
161 - Much better.\\
162 - So when can I see you again?\\
163 - I don't know. I'll call you. How about tonight?\\
164 - We'll see. Now, go.\\
165 - I love you.\\
166 - You only think you love me because you can't have me.\\
167 - No, no, no, no. This is real. How can I prove it to you?\\
168 - Vincent Van Gogh cut off his ear for the woman he loved.\\
169 - Think about it.\\
170 - Would you settle for my brother's ear?\\
171 - Bye.\\
172 - (sighs)\\
173 - You forgot your bells.\\
174 - * Men.\\
175 - I almost forgot-- I need 100 bucks.\\
176 - What for?\\
177 - SAT prep class.\\
178 - Oh, oh, sure.\\
179 - Glad to see you're taking the test seriously.\\
180 - Hey, if I don't do well on the test,\\
181 - then I can't get into a good college.\\
182 - And if I can't get into a good college,\\
183 - then I'll never get into grad school.\\
184 - And if I never get into grad school,\\
185 - what kind of future can I look forward to?\\
186 - What's the money really for?\\
187 - Video games and online porn.\\
188 - You were actually going to give me the money, weren't you?\\
189 - I had a good week.\\
190 - (doorbell ringing)\\
191 - Oh, hey, guys.\\
192 - Hey, Herb. Hey.\\
193 - So how's it going?\\
194 - You know, living the dream.\\
195 - JUDITH: Damn it, Herb!\\
196 - How many times have I told you not to use the guest towels?!\\
197 - Hey, if I'm going to sleep in the guest room,\\
198 - I get to use the guest towels!\\
199 - Yeah. I remember that dream.\\
200 - So how are things with you?\\
201 - Could not be better.\\
202 - Is that like me living the dream?\\
203 - Oh, no, no, really. I'm, uh...\\
204 - I'm working on a pretty exciting business opportunity.\\
205 - Oh, no kidding. Yeah, it's, uh...\\
206 - Well, actually, it's something you might...\\
207 - Ah, no, never mind.\\
208 - So how's the pediatrician game?\\
209 - Like taking money from babies.\\
210 - Come on, tell me-- what business opportunity?\\
211 - Oh, well, it's an investment thing, but, uh...\\
212 - but Judith would never let you get into it.\\
213 - And... and the fact that my mother\\
214 - and Charlie are already in\\
215 - would just freak her out even more.\\
216 - You mother and brother invested?\\
217 - And you know they didn't do that out of love.\\
218 - Yeah, they're not fond of you at all. Hmm.\\
219 - Well, anyway, it's, uh... it's good seeing you.\\
220 - Alan, wait.\\
221 - How much are we talking about?\\
222 - Well, uh, my mother and Charlie are each in for...\\
223 - $15,000.\\
224 - I can do that.\\
225 - Hang on, I'll get my checkbook.\\
226 - (whispers): Oh, and, uh, don't tell Judith.\\
227 - The years I wasted actually working for a living.\\
228 - Schmuck!\\
229 - * Men.\\
230 - * Men.\\
231 - (doorbell ringing)\\
232 - Hey, Mr. Harper.\\
233 - Hi, Gordon. How you been?\\
234 - I'm almost 40 years old, and I'm delivering you a pizza.\\
235 - Kind of says it all, doesn't it?\\
236 - Pretty much.\\
237 - That'll be $23.75.\\
238 - Oh, let me get my wallet.\\
239 - Come on in.\\
240 - (phone ringing)\\
241 - Hang on a sec.\\
242 - Hello.\\
243 - Oh, hey, baby.\\
244 - I thought you said Manny was at work.\\
245 - I thought this was our time together.\\
246 - All right, fine. Just call me when you can.\\
247 - Damn.\\
248 - Everything okay, Mr. Harper?\\
249 - My date just canceled.\\
250 - Can't the service send over another girl?\\
251 - Not a girl like this one.\\
252 - This is the girl I plan to spend\\
253 - the rest of my life with.\\
254 - Probably regretting getting the large, then, huh?\\
255 - You want to join me? Do I have to give back the tip?\\
256 - Nah, come on in.\\
257 - So who's the woman?\\
258 - Remember Rose? My Rose?\\
259 - Your Rose?\\
260 - Yeah, we dated for a while.\\
261 - Uh, no offense, Gordon, but...\\
262 - I think she was only going out with you to make me jealous.\\
263 - In fact, that's the only reason she ever went out with anybody.\\
264 - I don't know, Mr. Harper.\\
265 - I really think there was something special between us.\\
266 - She was always getting me little love gifts.\\
267 - Cargo shorts, bowling shirts, 20-year-old scotch...\\
268 - Yeah, I remember Rose.\\
269 - So you guys are going out?\\
270 - I wouldn't exactly call it going out.\\
271 - She's kind of married.\\
272 - Wow. Rose got married.\\
273 - Yep.\\
274 - To some clown named Manny Quinn.\\
275 - Is he really a clown?\\
276 - I have to ask, 'cause it's Rose.\\
277 - No, no. He's in the fashion industry or something.\\
278 - Wow. So Rose is married\\
279 - and cheating on her husband with you?\\
280 - Yep.\\
281 - God, I love your life!\\
282 - Well, thanks, but it's...\\
283 - it's really not as fun as it looks.\\
284 - Really? I'm kidding.\\
285 - Cheers.\\
286 - To me.\\
287 - * Men.\\
288 - Hey, Rose. It's Charlie again.\\
289 - I don't know if you got my text.\\
290 - I just wanted to tell you that I was thinking about you\\
291 - and I can't wait to see you.\\
292 - You know, when you can.\\
293 - Love you.\\
294 - Really, I do.\\
295 - Hey, Charlie?\\
296 - Yeah?\\
297 - When did you become a bitch?\\
298 - What are you talking about?\\
299 - I was just leaving her a message.\\
300 - The girl is married.\\
301 - Leave her alone.\\
302 - I can't.\\
303 - I love her. I need her.\\
304 - Bitch.\\
305 - Oh, hey.\\
306 - You been shopping?\\
307 - Little bit.\\
308 - A little bit?\\
309 - Oh, you know, a few pairs of socks, a new belt.\\
310 - Couple of Dolce & Gabbana suits, Gucci loafers and a Rolex.\\
311 - Wow.\\
312 - Business must be picking up.\\
313 - Uh, it is.\\
314 - But I take it not enough to pay back your investor.\\
315 - Oh. Oh, no.\\
316 - I-I... I fully intend to pay you back.\\
317 - In fact...\\
318 - here...\\
319 - is your initial investment.\\
320 - $5,000.\\
321 - And here\\
322 - is an additional... $1,000\\
323 - in interest.\\
324 - Berta, are you seeing this?\\
325 - Am I dreaming?\\
326 - You got the Kardashian sisters under the table?\\
327 - Nope.\\
328 - Then, you're not dreaming.\\
329 - Thank you very much for your confidence in me.\\
330 - Hey, it's still confidence if I'm figuring you'll fail.\\
331 - I told you advertising would drive in customers,\\
332 - and I was right.\\
333 - Hang on a sec.\\
334 - What?\\
335 - Do you think more advertising would drive in more customers?\\
336 - I don't see why not.\\
337 - Of course, the ads would have to reach a larger audience,\\
338 - and that would cost, you know, more money.\\
339 - Tell you what.\\
340 - Let it ride.\\
341 - Really?\\
342 - Come on.\\
343 - In fact, here is another four.\\
344 - Hold on.\\
345 - Think I have more upstairs.\\
346 - Oh, look in the back of your underwear drawer.\\
347 - I needed underwear.\\
348 - You borrowed your brother's skivvies?\\
349 - That's disgusting.\\
350 - I agree. That's why, when I found the money,\\
351 - I took $100 to buy some new ones.\\
352 - So listen.\\
353 - Can anybody get in on this deal of yours?\\
354 - Excuse me?\\
355 - I'm always looking for smart investments.\\
356 - And I've got some extra cash that's a result\\
357 - of a little hydroponic farming venture in Chino.\\
358 - What are you farming?\\
359 - Alfalfa. What's it to you?\\
360 - Gee, I-I don't know, Berta.\\
361 - I mean, you realize there's no guarantees.\\
362 - You'd actually be doing me a favor.\\
363 - My bank asks a lot of questions about my... alfalfa earnings.\\
364 - All right, fine.\\
365 - How much do you want to invest?\\
366 - Ten grand.\\
367 - Great.\\
368 - Uh, when can you get it to me?\\
369 - As soon as I come back from the bathroom.\\
370 - Boy, I hope she means it's behind the toilet.\\
371 - * Men.\\
372 - (doorbell rings)\\
373 - ROSE: Who is it?\\
374 - Pizza.\\
375 - Door's open. I'll be right down.\\
376 - Hello.\\
377 - Gordon? Rose?\\
378 - Oh, my gosh. It's been so long.\\
379 - Yeah.\\
380 - How are you doing?\\
381 - Just great.\\
382 - Got a new shirt with my name on it.\\
383 - Lighted sign for the roof of my car.\\
384 - How nice. Yeah.\\
385 - How about you? I heard you got married.\\
386 - Yes. I am now Mrs. Manfred Quinn.\\
387 - Wow. Congrats.\\
388 - Thank you. Yeah.\\
389 - So...\\
390 - That'll be $23.75.\\
391 - Let me just get my purse.\\
392 - Mrs. Manfred Quinn.\\
393 - Manny Quinn.\\
394 - Manny Quinn.\\
395 - Holy crap, this is great.\\
396 - * Men.\\
397 - ALAN: It's real, Mom.\\
398 - You understand my skepticism.\\
399 - Sure.\\
400 - And this is $12,000?\\
401 - Yep. The $10,000 you gave me, plus your profit.\\
402 - I don't know what to say.\\
403 - How about, "I'm proud of you, Alan. Well done."\\
404 - I'm proud of you, Alan. Well done.\\
405 - "I knew you had it in you. Attaboy."\\
406 - Let's not push it.\\
407 - Okay. Well, uh, again,\\
408 - thank you for helping me get my business going.\\
409 - I'll see you.\\
410 - Hold on.\\
411 - Yes?\\
412 - Since you seem to be on a roll,\\
413 - what would happen if I didn't take my investment out?\\
414 - And maybe threw in another eight\\
415 - to make it an even $20,000?\\
416 - (chuckles)\\
417 - $20,000 is a lot of money.\\
418 - And, as you're aware, all investments carry risk.\\
419 - Darling, if you cut me out of this, I'll kill you.\\
420 - What can I say? You're in.\\
421 - (chuckling)\\
422 - Uh, Alan has one "L."\\
423 - Oh.\\
424 - * Men.\\
425 - (doorbell rings)\\
426 - Hey, Mr. Harper.\\
427 - Hey, Gordon.\\
428 - $23.75? You got it.\\
429 - Hey, I delivered a pizza to Rose the other day.\\
430 - Oh, yeah?\\
431 - Did you meet her husband?\\
432 - You mean Manny?\\
433 - Yeah.\\
434 - I take it you haven't.\\
435 - Well, no, for obvious reasons.\\
436 - What kind of guy is he?\\
437 - He's quiet.\\
438 - A little stiff.\\
439 - What did you say he did for a living?\\
440 - Uh, he's some kind of important figure\\
441 - in the fashion industry.\\
442 - Right. Right.\\
443 - So Manny Quinn--\\
444 - an important figure in the fashion industry.\\
445 - Right.\\
446 - Here's $30. Keep the change.\\
447 - Thanks.\\
448 - Manny Quinn, Mr. Harper.\\
449 - Fashion figure.\\
450 - That's what I said.\\
451 - Manny... Quinn... figure.\\
452 - Uh-huh.\\
453 - Manny Quinn!\\
454 - What the hell is wrong with you?\\
455 - Nothing. Good night.\\
456 - Good night.\\
457 - He's got the beach house and I'm delivering pizzas.\\
458 - Un-freaking-believable!\\
459 - * Men.\\
460 - (doorbell rings)\\
461 - How dare you.\\
462 - Nice to see you, too.\\
463 - You go behind my back and talk my husband\\
464 - into giving you some kind of business loan?\\
465 - Herb told you? Of course, Herb told me.\\
466 - We love each other.\\
467 - We love each other so much,\\
468 - she went through my checkbook.\\
469 - Not to worry.\\
470 - I am very pleased to announce\\
471 - that your investment has paid off.\\
472 - (sighs)\\
473 - That's your original $15,000,\\
474 - plus 20% interest.\\
475 - Wow.\\
476 - You're welcome.\\
477 - Oh, can... can I see?\\
478 - Alan, wait.\\
479 - Yeah?\\
480 - What if we don't want to cash out?\\
481 - Whatever do you mean?\\
482 - Reinvest this and add in\\
483 - the next six months of your child support.\\
484 - Hold on, now. That money's supposed to be for Jake.\\
485 - Oh, don't be so naive.\\
486 - You want it or not?\\
487 - Sure, if you insist.\\
488 - Well, see you.\\
489 - Bye.\\
490 - I'm thinking somebody owes somebody an apology.\\
491 - I'm sorry.\\
492 - * Men.\\
493 - * Men.\\
494 - (laughing)\\
495 - Unbelievable!\\
496 - You ask for money, and they just give it to you.\\
497 - And then you take the new money\\
498 - and use it to pay back some of the old money.\\
499 - But they don't want it back.\\
500 - And they give you more.\\
501 - 'Cause they're greedy.\\
502 - Greedy, greedy, greedy, greedy.\\
503 - Oh, God, what have I done?\\
504 - ALAN'S VOICE: Oh, quit your whining.\\
505 - Who said that?\\
506 - Over here.\\
507 - Hi.\\
508 - How you doing?\\
509 - Not so good.\\
510 - Feeling better?\\
511 - This isn't happening.\\
512 - I'm losing my mind.\\
513 - Your mind is fine.\\
514 - What you should be worried about is losing your hair.\\
515 - Now, do yourself a favor and stop with the guilt.\\
516 - How?\\
517 - I'm betraying my friends.\\
518 - I'm betraying my family.\\
519 - Feels good, doesn't it?\\
520 - Yes. No!\\
521 - I'm... well, I'm not sure.\\
522 - Oh, come on. You've spent your whole life being a doormat.\\
523 - This is your chance to finally get what you deserve.\\
524 - But what about the guilt?\\
525 - The hell with the guilt.\\
526 - Let's be bad guys.\\
527 - Bad guys?\\
528 - It's time for a change, don't you think?\\
529 - Could we grow a mustache?\\
530 - I've always wanted a mustache.\\
531 - We're going to grow balls.\\
532 - Oh, good.\\
533 - I've always wanted those, too.\\
534 - * Men.\\
535 - See you.\\
536 - Where you going? Out.\\
537 - Out?\\
538 - Yeah. Out.\\
539 - You got a problem with that?\\
540 - No. Not at all.\\
541 - All right, then.\\
542 - * Men.*

28 - Really?\\
29 - Hey, a 20% return in a couple of weeks? Come on.\\
30 - So listen, can anybody get in on this deal of yours?\\

33 - to pay back some of the old money,\\
34 - but they don't want it back.\\
35 - And they give you more.\\

39 - Hi. I'd like a Jumbo Jack and an apple turnover.\\
40 - (door slides open)\\
41 - Do you want fries with that?\\
42 - Sorry. I didn't realize there was anybody in there.\\
43 - Um, bless me, Father, for I have sinned?\\
44 - Are you asking me or telling me?\\
45 - Telling you?\\
46 - I-I'm sorry. I just not really sure of the rules.\\
47 - When was your last confession?\\
48 - Oh, wow, let's see...\\
49 - uh, that would be... never?\\
50 - Are you even Catholic?\\
51 - No, but I'm a big fan.\\
52 - The costumes, the music, crackers and wine.\\
53 - That's the body and blood of our Savior.\\
54 - I know! Mm-mm good!\\
55 - You guys ever think\\
56 - about putting that in supermarkets\\
57 - like a Lunchable?\\
58 - What can I do for you, my son?\\
59 - Oh, right to it.\\
60 - Okay, just to be clear,\\
61 - what I tell you is between you and me.\\
62 - And the Lord.\\
63 - Sure, but I'm not worried\\
64 - about him blabbing.\\
65 - You I just met.\\
66 - Couldn't pick you out of a lineup.\\
67 - Whatever you say here is confidential.\\
68 - And I just drank a huge Arnold Palmer,\\
69 - so could you get to it?\\
70 - Absolutely, absolutely.\\
71 - Uh, uh, here it is.\\
72 - Do you know what a Ponzi scheme is?\\
73 - I do. Are you an investment banker?\\
74 - No, I'm a chiropractor.\\
75 - A chiropractic Ponzi scheme.\\
76 - Okay, you piqued my interest.\\
77 - Okay, long story short,\\
78 - I chiseled my family out of a lot of money\\
79 - that they're never going to see again.\\
80 - And you're feeling guilty.\\
81 - Bingo.\\
82 - Hey, bingo-- that's your racket, right?\\
83 - Yeah, that's us.\\
84 - You've got to like a god\\
85 - that's willing to put the hustle on old ladies.\\
86 - Arnold Palmer's on the 18th hole.\\
87 - Right, right, sorry, sorry.\\
88 - So I was hoping that you could forgive me.\\
89 - Are you prepared to make restitution\\
90 - and confess what you've done to your family?\\
91 - Oh, God no.\\
92 - I was just hoping you could give me a few Hail Marys\\
93 - and I could make a donation to the church's legal defense fund.\\
94 - Win-win.\\
95 - I'm afraid that's not how absolution works.\\
96 - You have to make an act of contrition\\
97 - and then do penance.\\
98 - Do I get to keep the money?\\
99 - No.\\
100 - Huh.\\
101 - Uh, you know what?\\
102 - Um, I'm just going to mosey over to Temple Beth Shalom\\
103 - and see what their deal is.\\
104 - I'll get back to you.\\
105 - Oy vey.\\
106 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
107 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
108 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\

110 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
111 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
112 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
113 - * Men.\\
114 - Wow.\\
115 - Yeah.\\
116 - That was incredible.\\
117 - More than incredible--\\
118 - it was transcendental.\\
119 - This is where I was always meant to be, Rose--\\
120 - right here in your arms.\\
121 - I'm so glad to hear you say that, Charlie.\\
122 - Now get out.\\
123 - So soon?\\
124 - Manny will be home any minute.\\
125 - But I want to cuddle.\\
126 - You want us to get caught?\\
127 - This isn't fair.\\
128 - The two of us sneaking around\\
129 - so we can spend an hour together.\\
130 - But what can I do?\\
131 - I have a husband.\\
132 - Let's go away for the weekend.\\
133 - Just the two of us.\\
134 - Where?\\
135 - I don't care.\\
136 - Someplace where we can walk down the street holding hands.\\
137 - Where we can laugh together, play together,\\
138 - yell at the top of our lungs and not care who hears us.\\
139 - So, Disneyland?\\
140 - I was thinking more in terms of someplace with liquor, but...\\
141 - That's Manny's car.\\
142 - I didn't hear anything.\\
143 - It's a Prius.\\
144 - Just think about it, okay?\\
145 - A romantic weekend with nothing for us to do\\
146 - but make love and be together.\\
147 - And, you know, drink.\\
148 - Yay.\\
149 - After all these years,\\
150 - I finally get a weekend with Charlie.\\
151 - Did you hear that, hubby?\\
152 - Up top.\\
153 - * Men.\\
154 - Think, damn it.\\
155 - There's got to be a way to lose the guilt and keep the money.\\
156 - BAD ALAN: There is.\\
157 - Leave me alone.\\
158 - You've made enough trouble for me already.\\
159 - Oh, quit your bitchin'.\\
160 - And for God's sake, stop washing your hands like Lady Macbeth.\\
161 - I have to wash my hands. I just peed.\\
162 - So?\\
163 - So what if I don't wash\\
164 - and then shake somebody's hand?\\
165 - Screw 'em. They were probably picking their nose.\\
166 - Now listen to me-- you've got to grow a pair.\\
167 - I've got a pair.\\
168 - You've got a pair of panties.\\
169 - Hey, you can't talk to me like that.\\
170 - And stay away from that darn priest.\\
171 - I need somebody to talk to.\\
172 - That's what I'm here for. Dad?\\
173 - Hey, buddy.\\
174 - Is there somebody in there with you?\\
175 - Oh, no. Nobody but me. See?\\
176 - Then who were you talking to?\\
177 - Oh, I was just singing.\\
178 - That wasn't singing.\\
179 - Who are you, Simon Cowell?\\
180 - What do you want?\\
181 - I need to borrow 50 bucks.\\
182 - Oh, oh, sure.\\
183 - The reason I need it is, me and Eldridge\\
184 - went to visit this friend of ours\\
185 - who's in the hospital, but he forgot his book on the bus,\\
186 - so I lent him mine, but wouldn't you know it, he lost that one, too.\\
187 - So now I have to buy two math books\\
188 - 'cause he's broke, and there's this big math test coming up\\
189 - and we were going to study together for it.\\
190 - Oversold it, didn't I?\\
191 - * Men.\\
192 - (chuckling)\\
193 - What's funny?\\
194 - Rose is at a dinner party with her husband\\
195 - and she's sexting me from under the table.\\
196 - Sexting?\\
197 - It's like regular texting, but, you know, dirty.\\
198 - You see, that's not a smiley face.\\
199 - Charming.\\
200 - Um, listen, I need to talk to you about something.\\
201 - Yeah, sure. What's up?\\
202 - (test message chimes)\\
203 - Oh, you bad girl.\\
204 - You know that money you gave to me\\
205 - to invest in my business?\\
206 - Yeah, what about it?\\
207 - Well, here's the thing.\\
208 - I-I know I said I was going to buy advertising... Oh, I almost forgot.\\
209 - I told Rose about how well you're doing for me,\\
210 - and now she wants in.\\
211 - She does?\\
212 - Oh, yeah. And she's loaded, too.\\
213 - Huh.\\
214 - So what did you want to talk about?\\
215 - Uh...\\
216 - Just that we're making money up the wazoo.\\
217 - So you're going to need a bigger wazoo.\\
218 - That's great.\\
219 - (text message chimes)\\
220 - (chuckles)\\
221 - Oh, man, she's not wearing any underwear.\\
222 - She texted you that?\\
223 - Sent me a picture.\\
224 - Excuse me, but I gotta respond.\\
225 - Uh, let me just give you some privacy.\\
226 - Where you going?\\
227 - Who's gonna take the picture?\\
228 - * Men.\\
229 - So, Rose, I appreciate your interest,\\
230 - but things are going incredibly well.\\
231 - Yeah, I can barely handle\\
232 - the volume of patients I have now.\\
233 - Really? $30,000?\\
234 - Take it. Take it! Shh, shh.\\
235 - We could get a new car.\\
236 - Maybe one with a working radio--\\
237 - and brakes.\\
238 - You know what, Rose?\\
239 - We've been friends a long time,\\
240 - so I'm going to make an exception here.\\
241 - You're welcome.\\
242 - Can you wire the money over today?\\
243 - I can give it to you right now.\\
244 - Whoa!\\
245 - You surprised me.\\
246 - Oh, Alan, Alan, Alan.\\
247 - What are you doing?\\
248 - Oh, what do you mean?\\
249 - I'm-I'm just taking a break between patients.\\
250 - Oh, uh, uh...\\
251 - Chiropractic X-ray glasses.\\
252 - Cutting-edge stuff.\\
253 - Oh, please.\\
254 - There's nobody in the waiting room.\\
255 - You don't even have a receptionist.\\
256 - Oh, she's off. It's a Jewish holiday.\\
257 - Which one?\\
258 - Hava-na-kuchnik.\\
259 - What are you doing here?\\
260 - Did you really think I was going to invest\\
261 - without doing my due diligence?\\
262 - Everybody else did.\\
263 - Now I know what's really going on.\\
264 - No, you don't.\\
265 - You're stealing from your own family.\\
266 - Oh... I guess you do.\\
267 - Shame on you.\\
268 - A whistle blower.\\
269 - This could be problematic.\\
270 - * Men.\\
271 - Oh, boy, oh, boy.\\
272 - She's gonna tell Charlie.\\
273 - Charlie's gonna tell Mom then Berta\\
274 - then Herb then Judith.\\
275 - Oh, my God-- Judith.\\
276 - Gotta be something that I can do. There's got to be.\\
277 - BAD ALAN: As long as you're sitting on the toilet,\\
278 - why don't you whip out your lady parts and tinkle?\\
279 - You-- this is all your fault!\\
280 - I didn't hear you bellyaching when you were\\
281 - sitting in your office watching 3-D beach babes.\\
282 - Excuse me, but I am about to go to jail!\\
283 - You know what happens to pretty, slender fellas in jail?\\
284 - Yeah, they usually hang themselves\\
285 - after their first shower.\\
286 - But relax.\\
287 - Rose ain't gonna tell nobody nothin'.\\
288 - Way I see it, you've got as much on her as she's got on you.\\
289 - You're right.\\
290 - She's cheating on her husband.\\
291 - Winner, winner, chicken dinner.\\
292 - She tells on me, I tell on her.\\
293 - Criss-cross, apple sauce.\\
294 - I got nothing to worry about.\\
295 - Herky-jerky, where's your turkey?\\
296 - Why do you keep talking like that?\\
297 - I'm looking for a catch phrase.\\
298 - BERTA: Zippy?\\
299 - Flim-flam, you're in a jam.\\
300 - Oh, hey!\\
301 - Somebody in there with you?\\
302 - Oh, no, no.\\
303 - Um, how can I help you?\\
304 - Just brought your clean towels.\\
305 - Oh, uh, what about my washcloths?\\
306 - I threw those away.\\
307 - Why? Do you really have to ask?\\
308 - Miss you, kiss you, use a tissue.\\
309 - * Men.\\
310 - You're awfully quiet tonight.\\
311 - Now, don't look at me that way.\\
312 - You knew the deal when we got married.\\
313 - (doorbell rings)\\
314 - Uh-oh.\\
315 - Shh.\\
316 - Who is it?\\
317 - It's Alan.\\
318 - We need to talk.\\
319 - Just a second.\\
320 - Let's go, Rose.\\
321 - I haven't got all night.\\
322 - What is wrong with you?\\
323 - Manny is taking a nap on the deck.\\
324 - Oh, well, maybe I need to, uh, wake him up\\
325 - and have a little talk with him.\\
326 - About what?\\
327 - Well, it occurred to me that you might be tempted\\
328 - to tell someone about my little business venture.\\
329 - Oh, you mean your Ponzi scheme?\\
330 - Knock it off, Rose.\\
331 - Unless you want me to tell your husband\\
332 - that you're having an affair with my brother.\\
333 - You wouldn't.\\
334 - Criss-cross, apple sauce.\\
335 - What?\\
336 - Doesn't matter.\\
337 - The point is, if you tell, I'll tell.\\
338 - Go ahead.\\
339 - Tell him.\\
340 - If my husband leaves me, I'll still have Charlie.\\
341 - But if I tell everyone what you've been up to,\\
342 - what will you have?\\
343 - Crap.\\
344 - Oopsie-doopsie, watch your poopsie.\\
345 - (bird squawking)\\
346 - There's a bird on your husband's head.\\
347 - Yeah. So?\\
348 - (bird squawking)\\
349 - Crap.\\
350 - * Men.\\
351 - * Men.\\
352 - This is your husband?\\
353 - This is Manny Quinn?\\
354 - Oh, my God, Manny Quinn.\\
355 - Your husband's a dummy.\\
356 - To be fair, he wasn't the one fooled by a mannequin.\\
357 - What do you use to get bird poop off a husband?\\
358 - Charlie thinks you're actually married.\\
359 - Uh, yeah, that's kind of the idea.\\
360 - I'm not gonna let you scam him like that.\\
361 - I understand.\\
362 - What's that, Manny?\\
363 - I hadn't even thought of that.\\
364 - Thought of what?\\
365 - What did he-- What are you saying?\\
366 - How much would you need to pay back\\
367 - all the money you stole from your family?\\
368 - I didn't steal, they invested.\\
369 - Fine. How much?\\
370 - $50,000.\\
371 - Why don't you wait here and I'll go get my checkbook.\\
372 - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\\
373 - I-I am loyal to my brother.\\
374 - You can't buy my silence with a check.\\
375 - You want cash? You have cash?\\
376 - I mean, I won't betray Charlie!\\
377 - You may have to kill him.\\
378 - * Men.\\
379 - Well, hey, uh, what are you still doing here?\\
380 - I need my money back.\\
381 - Why?\\
382 - Just found out\\
383 - two of my teenage granddaughters are pregnant.\\
384 - At the same time?\\
385 - By the same guy.\\
386 - Long story short, I need cash quick.\\
387 - Uh, o-okay.\\
388 - Um, how much are we talking?\\
389 - All of it. A-All of it?\\
390 - Is that a problem?\\
391 - No, no, it's not a-a problem.\\
392 - Um... if you want cash, um, you'll have to wait\\
393 - till tomorrow, so I can go to the bank.\\
394 - Tomorrow's fine.\\
395 - Good, good.\\
396 - Of course you're gonna lose quite a bit\\
397 - by pulling out early.\\
398 - Yeah, well, if Jimmy Lee had done the same,\\
399 - I wouldn't need the money.\\
400 - Okay, tomorrow!\\
401 - Oh, boy.\\
402 - BAD ALAN: Don't panic.\\
403 - In the toaster, numb-nuts.\\
404 - Okay, Mr. Smart Guy.\\
405 - How do you suggest I pay off Berta?\\
406 - I spent all the money.\\
407 - On what?\\
408 - Well, you know,\\
409 - clothing, jewelry, electronics, a little lipo.\\
410 - Liposuction?\\
411 - I had a bit of a muffin top.\\
412 - You know, I actually feel a lot better about myself now.\\
413 - Okay, well, um,\\
414 - then you're gonna have to get another investor.\\
415 - What about the goofy chick?\\
416 - Rose?\\
417 - She did offer me $50,000.\\
418 - Why didn't you take it, schmuck?\\
419 - Because if I took it, I would have to betray my brother.\\
420 - CHARLIE: Hey, Alan.\\
421 - Who you talking to?\\
422 - Nobody.\\
423 - Want some toast?\\
424 - Maybe later. Check it out.\\
425 - Two first-class tickets to Paris.\\
426 - We're going to Paris?\\
427 - Great idea.\\
428 - Can we leave before the banks open tomorrow?\\
429 - What?!\\
430 - Are you out of your mind?\\
431 - I'm taking Rose.\\
432 - Did you know they have their own Disneyland there,\\
433 - and they serve wine?\\
434 - But what about her husband?\\
435 - I'm gonna ask her to leave him and marry me.\\
436 - Oh, gee, Charlie, that may not be the best idea.\\
437 - I don't recall asking for your opinion.\\
438 - Hey, hey, I'm just looking out for you.\\
439 - Do me a favor, a little less looking out,\\
440 - little more moving out.\\
441 - You're right. Screw him.\\
442 - Okay, let's go get that cash\\
443 - from the crazy chick who married the mannequin.\\
444 - She's crazy?\\
445 - I'm the one talking to a kitchen appliance.\\
446 - Hey, look, I'm trapped in a toaster.\\
447 - Wait, wait, I'm coming with you!\\
448 - * Men.\\
449 - I think that's everything.\\
450 - So what did you tell your husband?\\
451 - I didn't have to tell him anything.\\
452 - He's in New York for a big fashion show.\\
453 - Perfect.\\
454 - So what kind of clothes he design anyway?\\
455 - Men's sportswear, mostly.\\
456 - Anything I might like?\\
457 - No, it's more the kind of stuff\\
458 - Alan would wear.\\
459 - Oh, so, tacky.\\
460 - You know, I think I left my raincoat in the bedroom.\\
461 - I'll get it.\\
462 - Oh, thanks.\\
463 - Uh-oh.\\
464 - Whoa.\\
465 - I guess the guy brings his work home with him.\\
466 - Yep.\\
467 - Tacky.\\
468 - I got it!\\
469 - * Men.\\
470 - * Men.\\
471 - Here is your $10,000.\\
472 - Hope it works out with your granddaughters.\\
473 - They're 15 years old and pregnant.\\
474 - What should I look forward to, the next season of Teen Mom?\\
475 - And that is it.\\
476 - Everybody is paid off.\\
477 - But you're broke again.\\
478 - But my conscience is clear.\\
479 - Dy-no-mite!\\
480 - The rhyming thing really wasn't working.\\
481 - Leave me alone.\\
482 - All you are is my dark side.\\
483 - Fine, would you rather listen to your light side?\\
484 - What are you talking about?\\
485 - There's more of us in here, buddy.\\
486 - More?\\
487 - Oh, really?\\
488 - That shirt with those pants?\\
489 - What were you thinking?\\
490 - Okay, who else you got?\\

1 -     Men, men, men, men    \\
2 -     Men, men, men, men, men, men, men.    \\
3 - Hello.\\
4 - I'm Charlie's brother Alan.\\
5 - I want to thank you all for coming.\\
6 - I know this is\\
7 - a very sad day for all of us.\\
8 - Speak for yourself.\\
9 - Okay.\\
10 - Uh, I understand that some of you have "mixed feelings."\\
11 - Um... but I think we can all agree\\
12 - that Charlie lived life to its fullest\\
13 - and-and gave it everything he had.\\
14 - Gave me herpes.\\
15 - Chlamydia.\\
16 - Vaginal warts.\\
17 - Excuse me, this is my dead son we're talking about.\\
18 - I loved him and I'm devastated that he's gone,\\
19 - leaving me with nothing but my memories and my regrets\\
20 - and the listing for his beautiful beachfront\\
21 - Malibu getaway with three bedrooms\\
22 - and three and a half baths\\
23 - and a beautiful panoramic ocean view.\\
24 - Help yourselves to brochures out by the coffee urn.\\
25 - Thank you, Mom.\\
26 - Um, anyway...\\
27 - Open house is Sunday, 1:00 to 5:00.\\
28 - Okay.\\
29 - Um, I'd like to take a moment to talk about my brother,\\
30 - um, and his incredible love for life.\\
31 - He also loved being spanked.\\
32 - While wearing my panties.\\
33 - He used my panties to make tea.\\
34 - M-My point is, um, that Charlie lived life on his own terms\\
35 - and-and never apologized for who he was.\\
36 - Yeah, blah, blah, blah.\\
37 - Why can't we see the body?\\
38 - Yeah, I didn't come all this way to spit on a closed coffin.\\
39 - Okay, I understand how you feel,\\
40 - but unfortunately due to the circumstances of his passing,\\
41 - the remains aren't exactly... spit-able.\\
42 - I have a question.\\
43 - O-Okay.\\
44 - Uh, I wasn't planning on doing a Q and A,\\
45 - uh, but go ahead.\\
46 - Thank you.\\
47 - Charlie owes me $38,000 for some,\\
48 - let's say, pharmaceuticals.\\
49 - Who do I talk to about that?\\
50 - Uh, well, I think that's something\\
51 - you'll have to discuss with the lawyers.\\
52 - Yeah.\\
53 - I'd rather not involve the law.\\
54 - And now, uh, I thought we'd take this moment\\
55 - to hear from the person who was with Charlie at the end.\\
56 - Thank you, Alan.\\
57 - Charlie Harper was the love of my life\\
58 - and a wonderful, wonderful man.\\
59 - Selfish pig.\\
60 - Sure, our relationship had its ups and downs\\
61 - and the occasional restraining order.\\
62 - But at the end,\\
63 - we ran away together to Paris, where he asked me to marry him.\\
64 - I said yes.\\
65 - And the next few days were the happiest of my life.\\
66 - Nothing could spoil it.\\
67 - Not even when I came home from shopping\\
68 - and found him taking a shower with another woman.\\
69 - That's our Charlie.\\
70 - But I forgave him\\
71 - because I loved him unconditionally.\\
72 - So you can imagine my horror when, the very next day,\\
73 - he slipped on the Metro platform\\
74 - and fell in front of an oncoming train.\\
75 - Never cross a crazy woman.\\
76 - I just want you all to know that Charlie didn't suffer.\\
77 - His body just exploded like a balloon full of meat.\\
78 - Thank you.\\
79 - I'm hungry.\\
80 - Anyone else hungry?\\
81 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
82 -     Ah.         Men.         Men.    \\

85 -     Men.    \\
86 - Charlie was the best boss I ever had.\\
87 - I needed a day off, "Sure, Berta, no problem."\\
88 - I needed a couple\\
89 - extra bucks,\\
90 - "Sure, Berta, no problem."\\
91 - All he ever asked in return was clean sheets\\
92 - and hosing the vomit off the occasional drug-addled hooker.\\
93 - What a beautiful story.\\
94 - Can I count on you to keep the house clean till I sell it?\\
95 - Can I count on you to keep paying me?\\
96 - Well, there's virtually no money in Charlie's estate,\\
97 - but I'll be happy to pay you once the house sells.\\
98 - Then that's when I'll clean it.\\
99 - I still don't see why we have to sell.\\
100 - I mean, he left it to me.\\
101 - Obviously, he wanted me to have it.\\
102 - Can you make the mortgage payments?\\
103 - No.\\
104 - Can you pay the property tax?\\
105 - Not per se.\\
106 - But I was kind of hoping you'd help out.\\
107 - I mean, after all, your grandson lives here part-time.\\
108 - Good job raising him.\\
109 - Uh, darling, I can't afford to maintain my house\\
110 - and your house at the same time.\\
111 - But you're my mommy.\\
112 - Good job raising him.\\
113 - Once I sell this place, you can come live with me.\\
114 - But why would I have to?\\
115 - I mean, won't I get a lot of money from the sale?\\
116 - Oh, please. Charlie had three mortgages on this place.\\
117 - Once we deduct closing costs and escrow fees\\
118 - and my commission, you'll be lucky to break even.\\
119 - Wait a minute, you're planning to take a commission?\\
120 - She doesn't work for free.\\
121 - Why should I?\\
122 - Don't think those silent ones are fooling anybody.\\
123 -     Men.    \\
124 - Hi. I'm here for the open house.\\
125 - Of course. Come right in.\\
126 - Thank you.\\
127 - Three bedrooms, three and a half baths,\\
128 - 60 feet of prime Malibu oceanfront.\\
129 - Wait a minute, I know this place.\\
130 - This is Charlie Harper's place, right?\\
131 - It was.\\
132 - Then I can't buy it.\\
133 - Uh...\\
134 - What? Why?\\
135 - Bad memories.\\
136 - Charlie and I had this\\
137 - drunken threesome with a crazy chick right on this couch.\\
138 - Sounds like a good memory.\\
139 - Yeah, well, unfortunately she passed out\\
140 - and Charlie and I kept going without her.\\
141 - Bad memory.\\
142 - Oh, the feng shui is great.\\
143 - I mean, the place just oozes positive energy.\\
144 - It's not practical.\\
145 - The commute downtown would kill me.\\
146 - Don't worry, sweetie.\\
147 - Just let the universe provide.\\
148 - The universe doesn't provide, I provide.\\
149 - I bust my ass 80 hours a week.\\
150 - Uh-oh.\\
151 - Sounds like somebody needs to meditate.\\
152 - Uh-oh.\\
153 - Sounds like somebody needs to file for divorce.\\
154 - Really?\\
155 - You want to play that card?\\
156 - 'Cause I will take you and your uptight bourgeois family\\
157 - for every penny you've got.\\
158 - Bye-bye!\\
159 - Bye-bye!\\
160 - What a fun couple.\\
161 -     Men.    \\
162 - Sorry, the open house is over.\\
163 - I got a package for Alan Harper.\\
164 - Oh, uh, that's me.\\
165 - Sign here.\\
166 - Ooh, how exciting.\\
167 - Wonder what it is.\\
168 - It's from a crematorium,\\
169 - so that kind of narrows it down.\\
170 - That's, uh, that's my brother.\\
171 - Berta, Charlie's here!\\
172 - Thank you.\\
173 - Enjoy.\\
174 - Well...\\
175 - here we are, buddy.\\
176 - Just like old times, huh?\\
177 - I'm talking and you're in a bottle ignoring me.\\
178 - I, uh, I wanted to tell you, uh, that I loved you,\\
179 - and I will miss you,\\
180 - and I will always be grateful for you taking Jake and me in,\\
181 - letting us live here all these years.\\
182 - So, now the question is...\\
183 - what do we do with you?\\
184 - I know what you said you wanted, but...\\
185 - I really don't think Pamela Anderson will agree\\
186 - to swallow your ashes.\\
187 - Um, I-I could take you with me to live at Mom's,\\
188 - but that's how horror movies start.\\
189 - Hey.\\
190 - Maybe I could sprinkle you on the beach.\\
191 - I mean, it's simple, it's dignified,\\
192 - and pretty girls covered with oil\\
193 - will be sitting on you all day.\\
194 - Kind of like your life.\\
195 - Except for the dignified part.\\
196 - All right.\\
197 - Well...\\
198 - I guess now is as good a time as any.\\
199 - I ain't cleaning him up.\\
200 -     Men.    \\
201 -     Men.    \\
202 - Can I use your phone?\\
203 - Sure.\\
204 - I guess.\\
205 - Are you okay?\\
206 - Yeah, I'm fine.\\
207 - I was just trying to drown myself.\\
208 - Wait, you-you tried to commit suicide?\\
209 - Yeah. But I had no idea that the water would be that cold.\\
210 - Suppose I could've worn a wet suit,\\
211 - but who tries to commit suicide in a wet suit, right?\\
212 - That phone right there?\\
213 - Oh, yeah, yeah.\\
214 - Thank you.\\
215 - Uh, you got a towel?\\
216 - Oh, sure.\\
217 - Thanks.\\
218 - Hi. It's me.\\
219 - I want you to know that I just flung myself in the ocean\\
220 - 'cause I can't live without you.\\
221 - No, I'm not calling you from the ocean.\\
222 - Because it was cold.\\
223 - I don't... I'm in some guy's house.\\
224 - Um, Alan Harper.\\
225 - I am in Alan Harper's house.\\
226 - How about it? Will you take me back?\\
227 - Are you sure?\\
228 - You heard what I said about the ocean, right?\\
229 - Okay, fine. I'll stop bothering you.\\
230 - But I want you to know that I will love you forever and ever.\\
231 - Really?\\
232 - That bothers you?\\
233 - Okay. Bye.\\
234 - You got a wet suit?\\
235 - Oh, come on. It... it can't be that bad.\\
236 - It could be. You don't know.\\
237 - No, no, I do.\\
238 - Come on. Come on. Sit down. Sit down.\\
239 - Listen.\\
240 - I have been where you are--\\
241 - uh, rejected, friendless, broke.\\
242 - I'm not broke.\\
243 - I'm worth, like, a billion dollars.\\
244 - Beg pardon?\\
245 - 1.3 is what her lawyer says, but I would give up every penny\\
246 - if she would take me back.\\
247 - No, no, no. You don't want to do that.\\
248 - Uh... I think you can find a lot of girls for way less money.\\
249 - I don't want other girls.\\
250 - I want Bridget.\\
251 - Right. Right.\\
252 - Um, just to clarify, um,\\
253 - did you say "billion" with a "buh?"\\
254 - Listen, trust me.\\
255 - Money does not buy happiness.\\
256 - I wouldn't know. I've never had either.\\
257 - Come on. You're doing all right.\\
258 - You're living in a beach house in Malibu.\\
259 - I have to sell it.\\
260 - And it's not even mine; it's his.\\
261 - His?\\
262 - That's my dead brother.\\
263 - Oh.\\
264 - I'm sorry I made you spill him.\\
265 - That's okay. That's okay.\\
266 - I'll DustBust him later.\\
267 - You know what?\\
268 - I'll get out of your way.\\
269 - Thank you for letting me use your phone.\\
270 - Wait, hang on. You sure you're okay?\\
271 - Yeah. I'm just going to go back to my hotel room\\
272 - and update my Facebook status to "not dead yet."\\
273 - Wait, wait, wait. I... I just went to one funeral.\\
274 - I-I don't want to be involved in another one.\\
275 - Why don't you and I go out and have a drink and talk?\\
276 - About what?\\
277 - Oh, I don't know.\\
278 - The weather, politics.\\
279 - Why somebody would want to kill themselves\\
280 - when they have a billion freaking dollars.\\
281 - Come on.\\
282 - We'll, uh, put your clothes in the dryer.\\
283 - All right.\\
284 - Oh, by the way...\\
285 - I'm Walden. Walden Schmidt.\\
286 - Well, it's nice to meet you, Walden Schmidt.\\
287 - Oh. Oh, sure. I suppose there's no reason\\
288 - you can't undress right here in the living room.\\
289 - Oh, Skivvies coming off, too.\\
290 - Okay. Okay, well, uh, no body issues.\\
291 - Lucky you. That's...\\
292 - You're a good guy, Alan Harper.\\
293 - Oh, and he's a hugger as well.\\
294 - Okeydokey.\\
295 - I'll be right back.\\
296 - $1.3 billion,\\
297 - and he's hung like an elephant.\\
298 -     Men.    \\
299 - Uh, I will have an appletini.\\
300 - Uh, and, um...?\\
301 - Oh, uh, ginger ale, please.\\
302 - Really?\\
303 - Fresh off a suicide attempt,\\
304 - and you're ordering a ginger ale?\\
305 - Yeah. I don't like the taste of alcohol.\\
306 - Nobody likes the taste of alcohol.\\
307 - We like the effects of alcohol.\\
308 - How it makes you feel tall, good-looking and smart.\\
309 - I am tall, good-looking and smart.\\
310 - Give him an appletini.\\
311 - So, just out of curiosity,\\
312 - how does someone get to be worth so much money?\\
313 - Oh, it's pretty simple, really.\\
314 - You ever hear of Blungogo.com?\\
315 - No.\\
316 - And you never will,\\
317 - because Microsoft bought it from me\\
318 - for $1.3 billion, and then they bundled it\\
319 - with their iPod killer, the Zune.\\
320 - Really?\\
321 - I don't think it came with my Zune.\\
322 - You bought a Zune?\\
323 - I had a coupon.\\
324 - Cheers?\\
325 - Oh. Cheers.\\
326 - So, don't take this the wrong way,\\
327 - but I can't get the image of your penis out of my mind.\\
328 - Thank you. That's very sweet.\\
329 -     Men.    \\
330 - You don't understand.\\
331 - Bridget was my high school sweetheart.\\
332 - She was the love of my life.\\
333 - So why'd she leave you?\\
334 - She catch you with another woman?\\
335 - - No. - Sex no good?\\
336 - No, it was great.\\
337 - Are you sure?\\
338 - 'Cause sometimes they'll tell you it's good,\\
339 - and then you find out later\\
340 - they hated the very touch of you.\\
341 - Happened to a guy I know.\\
342 - Well, she said that I was emotionally immature.\\
343 - You mean like threatening suicide\\
344 - unless she takes you back?\\
345 - That is not immature; that's romantic.\\
346 - Shut up.\\
347 - Well, regardless, I-I know what you're going through.\\
348 - I mean, I married my college sweetheart,\\
349 - and when she divorced me, I was devastated.\\
350 - Why did she leave you?\\
351 - Not a clue. She's a crazy bitch.\\
352 - The point is, when life serves you\\
353 - ball breakers who rip your heart out,\\
354 - you have to make...\\
355 - ball breaker-ade.\\
356 - Bridget never broke my balls.\\
357 - If anything, she treated them\\
358 - with tenderness and respect.\\
359 - Okay. Okay, just for tonight,\\
360 - will you... will you forget about Bridget\\
361 - and-and just try to meet somebody new?\\
362 - Like who?\\
363 - I don't know.\\
364 - How about... how about her?\\
365 - Really?\\
366 - What would I say?\\
367 - Uh, well, I would not lead with the testicle anecdote.\\
368 - Just... just say hi.\\
369 - Okay.\\
370 - Hi.\\
371 - Hi.\\
372 - - I'm Walden. - Kelly.\\
373 - So, Kelly...\\
374 - My... wife dumped me, and I want to die.\\
375 - Oh, you poor baby.\\
376 - I love her so much.\\
377 - I... I don't...\\
378 - Whew! I don't know...\\
379 - if I can ever love anyone\\
380 - the way that I love her.\\
381 - That's the most beautiful thing that I've ever heard.\\
382 - Oh, it'll be okay.\\
383 - Oh, God, I miss my wife!\\
384 -     Men.    \\
385 - Here is where I live.\\
386 - Oh.\\
387 - Nice.\\
388 - Just me and my broken heart.\\
389 - Alan, I... I think I should go back to my hotel.\\
390 - Are you nuts?\\
391 - We're doing great.\\
392 - This crap about loving our exes is gold.\\
393 - My brother would be so proud.\\
394 - What, the dude in the DustBuster?\\
395 - Yeah.\\
396 - Ah. Uh, ladies, uh, who's up for a libation?\\
397 - - A what? - Huh?\\
398 - A... a drink-- alcohol.\\
399 - - Sure. - Great.\\
400 - Oh. Be right back.\\
401 - What's upstairs?\\
402 - I don't know. Probably a bedroom.\\
403 - Why don't we go find out?\\
404 - Uh... okay.\\
405 - Hey, shouldn't we tell Alan where we're going?\\
406 - No. No.\\
407 - Who's ready for margaritas?\\
408 - Wow!\\
409 - One at a time, ladies! One at a time.\\
410 - Well, this is depressingly familiar.\\
411 - Shut up.\\
412 -     Men.    \\
413 -     Men.    \\
414 - Morning.\\
415 - Oh, good golly.\\
416 - Oh, uh, I'm Walden.\\
417 - I'm impressed.\\
418 - Oh. Alan.\\
419 - Guess what.\\
420 - I had sex with two girls last night.\\
421 - Great. Um, I masturbated and cried myself to sleep.\\
422 - I like my night better.\\
423 - Oh, hey.\\
424 - I dig your house, so I'm going to buy it, okay?\\
425 - Oh, okay.\\
426 - Thanks.\\
427 - You're the best.\\
428 - Oh... ah.\\
429 - Whoa.\\
430 - Um, this is Walden.\\
431 - He's going to buy the house.\\
432 - Welcome to my humble abode.\\
433 - I like him.\\

10 - Not per say.\\
11 - Are you okay?\\
12 - Yeah, I'm fine.\\
13 - I was just trying to drown myself.\\
14 - You tried to commit suicide?\\
15 - Yeah.\\
16 - I had no idea that the water would be that cold.\\
17 - I have been where you are.\\
18 - Uh, rejected, friendless, broke.\\
19 - I'm not broke.\\
20 - I'm worth, like, a billion dollars.\\
21 - Beg pardon?\\
22 - I just went to one funeral,\\
23 - I don't want to be involved in another one.\\
24 - Why don't you and I go out and have a drink and talk?\\
25 - About what?\\
26 - Why somebody would want\\
27 - to kill themselves when they have a billion freakin' dollars.\\
28 - My...\\
29 - wife dumped me, and I want to die.\\

36 - Great. Um, I masturbated and cried myself to sleep.\\

129 - a month, tops.\\
130 - Yeah, right.\\
131 - Why can't you just stay with your girlfriend?\\
132 - Oh, oh, this isn't a very good time for Lyndsey and I\\
133 - to be moving in together.\\
134 - Why not?\\
135 - Well, she's going through\\
136 - one of those phases where, uh, the very touch of me\\
137 - fills her with revulsion.\\
138 - Um...\\
139 - I-I'm thinking it's premenopause.\\
140 - Yes, I'm sure that's why.\\
141 - Well, just so you know,\\
142 - I'm not putting my life on hold while you're here.\\
143 - Oh, and I wouldn't expect you to.\\
144 - Just go on with your life.\\

150 - Rough sex.\\
151 - Right.\\
152 - So, stay away from my bedroom.\\
153 - No problem.\\
154 - Even if you hear me screaming.\\
155 - Especially if I hear you screaming.\\
156 - Unless I'm repeatedly screaming "umbrella."\\
157 - U-Umbrella?\\
158 - That's my safe word.\\
159 - Sometimes they can't hear it through the leather mask.\\
160 - Most moms would've stopped with "I have a date tonight."\\
161 -     Men.    \\
162 - Hey, Bridge, it's me again.\\
163 - What is the name of that shampoo that I use\\

167 - Any supermarket.\\
168 - That is remarkably convenient.\\
169 - Oh, uh, while I have you on the phone,\\
170 - will you take me back?\\
171 - Wow, it's like "no" is your favorite word now.\\
172 - Okay, whoa, don't hang up, don't hang up.\\
173 - Hey, uh, what is the toilet paper that we use?\\
174 - You know, the stuff that's soft on my tushy like a cloud.\\

181 - I miss her so much.\\
182 - Oh, hey.\\
183 - Hey, everything's gonna be all right.\\

195 - Uh, you left some books in your room.\\
196 - Oh, thank you.\\
197 - Um, you didn't have to drive all the way over here.\\

199 - and make her your slave?\\
200 - Oh.\\
201 - That was a, that was a gag gift for my birthday.\\
202 - What about Ten Minutes a Day to Incredible Wealth?\\
203 - Oh, good, that's my poop book.\\
204 - Um, I'd invite you in,\\
205 - but my mom doesn't let me have friends over.\\
206 - That's cool.\\
207 - Mm.\\
208 - You want to go out and maybe do something?\\
209 - What do you have in mind?\\
210 - Umbrella!\\
211 - Doesn't matter, let's go.\\
212 - Umbrella! Umbrella! Umbr...\\
213 - Nice car.\\
214 - What is it?\\
215 - It's an electric Fisker.\\
216 - State-of-the-art lithium ion technology\\
217 - supplemented with a turbo-charged engine.\\
218 - Solar panels on the roof.\\
219 - Oh, blue Volkswagen.\\
220 - Punchbug!\\
221 - So, how much does something like this cost?\\
222 - About a hundred grand.\\
223 - It's great for the environment.\\
224 - I don't know why anyone would drive anything else.\\
225 - Speaking for myself, bone-crushing poverty\\
226 - is something of a stumbling block.\\
227 - Maybe you could lease.\\
228 - I got a confession to make, Alan.\\
229 - Me, too.\\
230 - The hypnotism book wasn't really a gift.\\
231 - I really came over because...\\
232 - I was kind of lonely.\\
233 - Oh, sure, sure.\\
234 - I been there.\\
235 - A lot.\\
236 - In fact, I'm there now.\\
237 - I've never really spent much time alone.\\
238 - I've been with Bridget since high school.\\
239 - Mm. High school sweethearts.\\
240 - When I was in high school,\\
241 - I was dating a poster of Molly Ringwald.\\
242 - You know, back then, she was crazy in love with me.\\
243 - I didn't even have any money then.\\
244 - Oh, I'm sure she still loves you.\\
245 - No.\\
246 - She's changed.\\
247 - Her heart has become cold and angry.\\
248 - Um, you're starting to go a little fast there, buddy.\\
249 - I mean, who just wakes up one day and all of a sudden\\
250 - decides they don't want to be married anymore?\\
251 - Uh, well, actually, it only seems that way.\\
252 - In my experience,\\
253 - they've been mulling it over for quite a while.\\
254 - Uh, you know, the speed limit is 35, and you're going,\\
255 - oh, oh, 80.\\
256 - I mean, what ever happened to till death do us part?\\
257 - Yeah, who died?\\
258 - Not you, not her.\\
259 - Oh, good golly, 95.\\
260 - Whoa! Whoa!\\
261 - This thing really takes the corners.\\
262 - I love her, Alan, and I want her back.\\
263 - Well, I know you do.\\
264 - Oh, 103, Walden, 103.\\
265 - Life is not worth living without Bridget!\\
266 - Truck, truck, truck!\\
267 - It hurts so much, I can't take it anymore!\\
268 - Umbrella!\\
269 -     Men.    \\
270 - I'm sorry I scared you by driving so fast.\\
271 - That's okay.\\
272 - I'm sorry I peed a little on your seat.\\
273 - Where are we?\\
274 - We're going to my house.\\
275 - I got to talk Bridget into taking me back.\\
276 - Oh, no.\\
277 - No, no, bad idea.\\
278 - When a woman says she doesn't want you, begging does not help.\\
279 - And I say this having spent more time on my knees\\
280 - than any straight man in America.\\
281 - What is this, a gated community?\\
282 - No, it's just my house.\\
283 - Wow.\\
284 - Instead of going to chiropractor school,\\
285 - I should have married a billionaire.\\
286 - Next time, you'll know.\\
287 - What are you doing here, Walden?\\
288 - I just want to talk to you.\\
289 - Go away or I'll call the police!\\
290 - "Go away or I'll call the police."\\
291 - Man, that takes me back.\\
292 - Um, what do you say I drive us home?\\
293 - How about that?\\
294 - I'm not giving up that easy.\\
295 - Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\\
296 - W-Where...?\\
297 - You heard what she said about the police, right?\\
298 - I'm going to get my wife back. Come on.\\
299 - Come on? What's my part in this?\\
300 - I need you to help me over the gate.\\
301 - O-Okay.\\
302 - Again, voice of experience here.\\
303 - Criminal trespass usually ends with her dating the cop.\\
304 - Will you just come on.\\
305 - Here, give me a hand.\\
306 - Here, let me go. I'm going this way.\\
307 - I got it. I got it.\\
308 - Okay, okay. I got it.\\
309 - Good luck.\\
310 - Come on.\\
311 - Again, come on?\\
312 - I may need your help getting in a window.\\
313 - Oh, terrific.\\
314 - Now I'm Spider-Man.\\
315 - I got you.\\
316 - Walden, do not make me turn that gate on.\\
317 - W-What does that mean?\\
318 - Turn the gate on?\\
319 - Don't worry, she's bluffing.\\
320 - I still have a buzzing in my ears.\\
321 - I can't hear you, I have a buzzing in my ears.\\
322 - God, Walden, what is wrong with you?\\
323 - Well, if loving you is wrong, then...\\
324 - I am wrong.\\
325 - It's true.\\
326 - He talks about you all the time.\\
327 - Okay, I expect this kind of thing from him;\\
328 - he has the emotional maturity of a 12-year-old.\\
329 - What's your excuse?\\
330 - Uh, I live at my mom's, and she's having\\
331 - rough sex with a stranger, and I had to get out of the house.\\
332 - Honey, I just don't understand why we can't work things out.\\
333 - Okay, I'll tell you again.\\
334 - Oh, this part is never good.\\
335 - I'm tired of living with a child.\\
336 - I'm tired of being more of a mother than a wife.\\
337 - Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa.\\
338 - You are not more of a mother than a wife.\\
339 - Really? Who picks out your clothes?\\
340 - You.\\
341 - Who tells you when to go to sleep?\\
342 - You.\\
343 - Who does all the cooking and cleaning around here?\\
344 - The cooking and the cleaning ladies.\\
345 - Before we were rich!\\
346 - You.\\
347 - Look, Walden, you're a sweet guy\\
348 - and I'll always love you,\\
349 - but I can't live with Peter Pan anymore.\\
350 - Uh, now, now, to be fair,\\
351 - uh, Peter Pan didn't want to grow up.\\
352 - Uh, from what I understand, Walden's just never had to.\\
353 - Sorry.\\
354 - Seemed important up here.\\
355 - Down here, not so much.\\
356 - Bridget, believe me, I can grow up.\\
357 - Oh, please.\\
358 - At least give me a chance to try.\\
359 - I gave you 15 years.\\
360 - It's over!\\
361 - Okay.\\
362 - Can I at least play\\
363 - a little Donkey Kong with Alan before I go?\\
364 - Are you insane?!\\
365 - Get out!\\
366 - Oh, yeah, fine, I'm insane!\\
367 - Come on, Alan!\\
368 - Thank you for the water and the...\\
369 - Hold on.\\
370 - Let's go.\\
371 - Where does she get off calling me a child?\\
372 - Um, you seem a little upset; maybe I should drive us. Um...\\
373 - She is a stupid-head.\\
374 - Oh, oh, white Volkswagen. Huh?\\
375 - Huh? Come on.\\
376 - Oh, wait, wait, I've got an idea.\\
377 - Why don't we stop, have a drink and talk about it.\\
378 - Drinking is not the answer.\\
379 - No, stopping is the answer!\\
380 - Oh, dear God, where is that toilet paper?!\\
381 - Oh, boy.\\
382 - Alan?\\
383 - Yeah?\\
384 - Why are you lying on top of me?\\
385 - 'Cause I didn't want to be on the bottom?\\
386 - I think we're naked.\\
387 - Yeah. You can ignore what's going on down there.\\
388 - That was a morning reflex.\\
389 - Could you get it off of me, please?\\
390 - Absolutely. Absolutely.\\
391 - Do you remember anything?\\
392 - Uh...\\
393 - we went to a liquor store, and then we came back here.\\
394 - Then we went skinny dipping.\\
395 - Right, right.\\
396 - Whose idea was that?\\
397 - Mine.\\
398 - Shh.\\
399 -     Men.    \\
400 - Okay, your pants are clean.\\
401 - Thank you.\\
402 - adult diapers.\\
403 - Look, Walden was driving ridiculously fast,\\
404 - and-and I have a nervous bladder.\\
405 - Save it, Zippy.\\
406 - This is not my first pee stain rodeo with you.\\
407 - Hi. Is Charlie here?\\
408 - Oh, God, another one.\\
409 - You deal with it.\\
410 - Um, hi. I'm-I'm Charlie's brother Alan.\\
411 - I'm Penelope.\\
412 - Is he here?\\
413 - Uh, maybe you better sit down.\\
414 - Is-Is everything okay?\\
415 - Um, no.\\
416 - Penelope, the-the thing is, uh, Charlie passed away.\\
417 - What?\\
418 - It was very sudden.\\
419 - Oh, my God.\\
420 - I'm sorry, he was just such a terrific guy.\\
421 - I can't believe he's gone.\\
422 - Hey, what's going on?\\
423 - Hello, I'm Penelope.\\
424 - Hi. I'm Walden.\\
425 - What are you crying about?\\
426 - I have no idea.\\
427 - Don't worry about me, I'll let myself out.\\

429 - Oh, thank you. It's baby shampoo.\\
430 - "What are you crying about?"\\
431 - "I have no idea."\\
432 - Oh, Bridget. Hi.\\
433 - Hi.\\
434 - I came to talk to Walden.\\
435 - Really?\\
436 - Yeah, I think maybe\\
437 - I've been a little hard on him.\\
438 - Well, um...\\
439 - Bridget?\\
440 - Hey.\\
441 - Walden?\\
442 - Look who came to talk to you, Walden.\\
443 - Your wife.\\
444 - You're married?\\
445 - Oh, yeah, long time married.\\
446 - Uh, they just met.\\
447 - This is Penelope, my girlfriend.\\
448 - What? Shut up and walk.\\
449 - I'm-I'm glad you came.\\
450 - Come, sit-sit down.\\
451 - When I saw you with that girl,\\
452 - I thought that maybe she was with you.\\
453 - You're kidding, right?\\
454 - I mean, come on, Alan's the ladies' man.\\
455 - He's a total pickup artist.\\
456 - Come on!\\
457 - Charlie's dead, Walden's married,\\
458 - what's wrong with me?!\\
459 -     Men.    \\
460 -     Men.    \\
461 - So, I was thinking\\
462 - we could go out to dinner sometime.\\
463 - Let me prove that I can change.\\
464 - I can be a grown-up.\\
465 - I guess I owe you that much.\\
466 - Sweet!\\
467 - Sorry to interrupt.\\
468 - I was just on a little jog with my lady.\\
469 - Uh, I'll, uh,\\
470 - get out of your way.\\
471 - Uh, hold on.\\
472 - I'm-I'm going to say good-bye to my guest,\\

474 - Alan, thank you.\\
475 - You saved my butt back there.\\
476 - Oh, I'm glad things are working out.\\
477 - I owe you big-time.\\

61 - Hey. What you doing?\\
62 - I'm building a neural metric backend\\
63 - for a social media aggregator.\\
64 - If I nail it, I can revolutionize\\
65 - the entire online entertainment sector.\\
66 - Ooh. Neural metrics.\\
67 - Cool.\\
68 - You know, I buy all my underwear online.\\
69 - Add to cart.\\
70 - Oh, no, no, no. Let me get that, boss.\\
71 - "Add to cart."\\
72 - That's adorable.\\
73 - What are you guys doing here?\\
74 - It's your weekend to have custody of this.\\
75 - Hello.\\
76 - Uh, Judith, I told you I'm a guest here.\\
77 - I can't just bring my kid over without asking.\\
78 - So ask. Bye.\\

85 - Just stand right here.\\
86 - But I really have to...\\
87 - Okay, how am I gonna play this?\\
88 - Dishonestly.\\
89 - Hey, Walden...\\
90 - Good news. I just got an e-mail from Bridget,\\
91 - we're going out to dinner tonight.\\
92 - Oh, dating the ex.\\
93 - Always good news.\\
94 - Uh, hey, speaking of broken families and good news, uh,\\
95 - do you remember my son Jake?\\
96 - Uh, yeah.\\
97 - Nice kid with the big head?\\
98 - Mm.\\
99 - Yeah, I like him.\\
100 - Uh, and he liked you, too.\\
101 - Uh, so much so that he decided to drop by and say hi.\\
102 - Where is he?\\
103 - Oh, he's waiting outside.\\
104 - I told him you can't just\\
105 - come over to someone's house unannounced.\\
106 - Why not? I do it all the time.\\
107 - Yeah, but you're a handsome billionaire.\\
108 - People are always happy to see you.\\
109 - I also told him there was no way he could sleep over.\\
110 - Why not?\\
111 - You wouldn't mind?\\
112 - Why would I mind?\\
113 - Hey.\\
114 - No reason.\\
115 - He's a great kid.\\
116 -     Men.    \\
117 - Okay, you need to keep in mind that it's not like the old days.\\
118 - I am a guest here.\\
119 - You mean like the old days when you were a guest here?\\
120 - I was not a guest.\\
121 - Right, 'cause guests eventually leave.\\
122 - Charlie was my brother; he loved having me here.\\
123 - Wow. Denial isn't just a river in South America.\\
124 - Africa.\\
125 - What about it?\\
126 - Never mind.\\
127 - Just-Just behave yourself while you're here.\\
128 - Fine. Can I have some privacy now?\\
129 - Oh, well, that actually leads me to another thing.\\
130 - Um, see, Berta's got my room now, so...\\
131 - No!\\
132 - Yes. No!\\
133 - It's just temporary.\\
134 - I'm not sleeping with my dad!\\
135 - When you go to college, you'll have a roommate.\\
136 - Yeah, but it won't be you.\\
137 - Come on, it'll be just like that time we went camping.\\
138 - I was ten and it was the worst weekend of my life.\\
139 - Hey, I didn't enjoy it either,\\
140 - but it's a father-son memory we'll share forever!\\
141 - What are we gonna do, sleep on the same bed?\\
142 - No, I'll get the air mattress out of the garage.\\
143 - That you'll sleep on.\\
144 - No! No! Yes! Yes!\\
145 - All right, all right! Forget about it.\\
146 - Look, okay, I will pack up our stuff\\
147 - and we will go back to Grandma's.\\
148 - Fine.\\
149 - Fine.\\
150 - Okay.\\
151 - Don't come crying to me when she starts driving you crazy.\\
152 - I won't.\\
153 - And remember, at Grandma's,\\
154 - you got to pee sitting down so there's no splatter.\\
155 - I'll manage, and that's how you pee anyway.\\
156 - I'm not bluffing, Jake.\\
157 - I believe you.\\
158 - All right, I'll sleep on the stupid air mattress!\\
159 - Good.\\
160 - Three more seconds and I would've folded.\\
161 - Damn!\\
162 -     Men.    \\
163 - So, where do you want to go to dinner tonight?\\
164 - What do you mean?\\
165 - You always pick the restaurant.\\
166 - Well, who says the man's supposed to pick the restaurant?\\
167 - Well, that's a stupid rule.\\
168 - Okay, yeah, I'll-I'll pick a restaurant.\\
169 - Okay, bye.\\
170 - Hey, Jake, do you know a romantic restaurant\\
171 - I can take a girl to dinner?\\
172 - How about Souplantation?\\
173 - Is it good?\\
174 - Are you kidding?\\
175 - All-you-can-eat salad, soup, pasta.\\
176 - I am in.\\
177 - Dude.\\
178 - What?\\
179 - That's my sandwich.\\
180 - It's delicious.\\
181 - So what's your deal?\\
182 - Huh?\\
183 - What's your deal?\\
184 - I'm 17. I don't think I have a deal yet.\\
185 - Ah, come on.\\
186 - Everybody's got a deal.\\
187 - Your deal is you got no deal.\\
188 - Cool.\\
189 - I'm a man without a deal.\\
190 - What are you, like, a high school senior or something?\\
191 - Well, I should be, but they got this dumb rule\\
192 - that you have to pass every single course.\\
193 - I think five out of seven is plenty, don't you?\\
194 - Heck yeah.\\
195 - In eighth grade, I flunked all my courses.\\
196 - Really?\\
197 - Yeah.\\
198 - My mom had me evaluated.\\
199 - Turns out, I was just bored\\
200 - 'cause I was too smart for all the classes.\\
201 - Huh. Maybe that's my problem.\\
202 - I'm too freakin' smart.\\
203 - Ow!\\
204 - I'm sorry.\\
205 - I just think we need to establish some boundaries.\\
206 - Hey, don't make hitting your deal.\\
207 -     Men.    \\
208 - Hey, Dad?\\
209 - Hang on.\\
210 - Didn't you used to have a bicycle pump?\\
211 - Yeah, and I also used to have my own room.\\
212 - What do you want, Jake?\\
213 - Okay, so you know how you're worried that 'cause I get\\
214 - bad grades in high school that I'm not gonna be able\\
215 - to get into college and then find a job to support myself?\\
216 - That pretty much sums it up, yeah.\\
217 - Well, it turns out, I get bad grades 'cause I'm too smart.\\
218 - Too smart?\\
219 - Yeah.\\
220 - So I'm gonna forget college,\\
221 - drop out of high school and start my own business.\\
222 - Hold on, hold on.\\
223 - You're too smart?\\
224 - Yep. Walden and me have that in common.\\
225 - Walden and I have that in common.\\
226 - No offense, Dad, but I don't think you're that smart.\\
227 - So, you're saying you want to drop out of high school?\\
228 - Why not?\\
229 - Did you know that Walden made\\
230 - his first million before he was 19?\\
231 - How many zeros in a million, Jake?\\
232 - M-I-L-L-I-O-N.\\
233 - One.\\
234 - Okay, okay, Jake, listen carefully.\\
235 - You are not dropping out of high school.\\
236 - But...\\
237 - No, you're not a genius,\\
238 - you're not a prodigy.\\
239 - Nice.\\
240 - My own father doesn't think I'm special.\\
241 - Oh.\\
242 - On the contrary.\\
243 - Your father thinks you're very special.\\
244 - Of course, I'm the dummy sleeping on the floor.\\
245 -     Men.    \\
246 -     Men.    \\
247 - Come in.\\
248 - Got a minute?\\
249 - Sure.\\
250 - Hey, I'm getting dressed for my dinner with Bridget.\\
251 - How do I look?\\
252 - Your face should be on gay money.\\
253 - Listen, um...\\
254 - You say something to my son about quitting high school\\
255 - and starting a business?\\
256 - Oh, yeah, I told him that's what I did.\\
257 - Hey, what do you think about a hat?\\
258 - The only reason to wear a hat on date\\
259 - is if you're hiding a bald spot.\\
260 - Oh.\\
261 - For your next date.\\
262 - Thank you.\\
263 - So you really quit high school?\\
264 - Mmm, no.\\
265 - I skipped high school.\\
266 - I quit MIT.\\
267 - Oh, okay. See, there's the misunderstanding.\\
268 - Jake has a hard time spelling MIT.\\
269 - Oh. Well, then, he really shouldn't quit school.\\
270 - Hey, check it out.\\
271 - My socks match my sneakers.\\
272 - But your sneakers don't match each other.\\
273 - Oh...\\
274 - Bridget used to pick out all my outfits.\\
275 - I can see why you miss her.\\
276 - Well, uh, thank you for clearing the Jake stuff up.\\
277 - Yeah, no problem.\\
278 - Uh, and, uh, going forward,\\
279 - keep in mind that kids like him are looking for role models,\\
280 - so you have to be careful around them.\\
281 - Yeah, sure. Although, truth to tell,\\
282 - unless he sees you passed out in a pool of vomit\\
283 - with a tattooed prostitute, you're going to be\\
284 - an improvement in the role model department.\\
285 - Hey, Alan? Yeah?\\
286 - You got a lot of experience with women, right?\\
287 - A lot? I don't know.\\
288 - You know, I've, uh, been around the block a few times.\\
289 - Did a little dance, made a little love,\\
290 - got down tonight on several occasions.\\
291 - Um, why do you ask?\\
292 - What can I do to convince Bridget to take me back?\\
293 - Oh.\\
294 - Walden, Walden, Walden, Walden.\\
295 - Come sit.\\
296 - Really? I got to sit?\\
297 - A woman's heart is a deep and mysterious place,\\
298 - almost impossible to reach.\\
299 - Much like the G-spot.\\
300 - Although at least we know the heart, in fact, exists.\\
301 - Okay, is that it? Can I stand up now?\\
302 - Oh, no. H-hang on. Hang on.\\
303 - When that heart closes itself to a man--\\
304 - and in my experience, it inevitably does--\\
305 - the only way to reopen it is to allow time to pass.\\
306 - That way, the woman can reflect\\
307 - on how much she misses her man.\\
308 - And that's worked for you?\\
309 - Oh, yeah.\\
310 - There are quite a few ladies out there\\
311 - currently reflecting on how much they miss Alan Harper.\\
312 - Good luck.\\
313 - Should've asked the kid.\\
314 -     Men.    \\
315 - Unbelievable.\\
316 - You don't like it.\\
317 - No, no, I blame myself.\\
318 - I trusted you to make a simple dinner reservation.\\
319 - Uh, don't blame me; blame Jake.\\
320 - Who's Jake?\\
321 - He's some kid without a deal.\\
322 - Besides, does it matter where we eat\\
323 - as long as we're with each other?\\
324 - I got to pee!\\
325 - Okay, bon app  tit.\\
326 - I got to pee!\\
327 - Don't you move.\\
328 - Hello!\\
329 - She's cute.\\
330 - You know, it's not too late.\\
331 - We could still have a kid.\\
332 - We already do.\\
333 - I'm looking at him.\\
334 - Oh, come on. That's not fair.\\
335 - Ah, hot soup!\\
336 - Hot soup.\\
337 - Thank you. Look, Walden,\\
338 - I agreed to have dinner with you\\
339 - because I care about you, but I just...\\
340 - Are we going to have sex later?\\
341 - Let me finish.\\
342 - But no.\\
343 - Aw.\\
344 - The thing is, even though I care about you,\\
345 - this marriage is over.\\
346 - I don't want to get a divorce.\\
347 - Why do we got to get a divorce?\\
348 - Because I have grown up\\
349 - and you are still the same guy you were at 19.\\
350 - No, that is not true.\\
351 - I got a lot more money now.\\
352 - Money isn't the point.\\
353 - I got lawyers, I got accountants,\\
354 - I got my own charitable foundation.\\
355 - It's not about what you have; it's about who you are.\\
356 - Oh.\\
357 - Well, I'm pretty much the same guy.\\
358 - What I want, what I need, is a partner in life.\\
359 - A grown-up, mature, responsible adult.\\
360 - What, and you don't think that's me?\\
361 - No, I don't.\\
362 - And you don't think I can change?\\
363 - No, I don't. But what if I can?\\
364 - But you can't. Can, too.\\
365 - Just eat your dinner.\\
366 - Ugh.\\
367 - This blows.\\
368 - I know, but it's something\\
369 - we're both just going to have to accept.\\
370 - How's your beach house?\\
371 - It's okay.\\
372 - But I miss you.\\
373 - I miss you, too, sometimes.\\
374 - Really?\\
375 - Walden, we were together for 15 years.\\
376 - Those feelings don't just go away.\\
377 - Hey, be cool.\\
378 - So, uh, you really still have feelings for me?\\
379 - Of course I do. Oh.\\
380 - Hey.\\
381 - Big girls don't throw food.\\
382 - Trust me, I can change.\\
383 - I really can.\\
384 - All right, that's it. Eat lettuce!\\
385 - Walden! What? She started it.\\
386 - Whoa! No pasta.\\
387 - I call no pasta.\\
388 - Oh, it is on!\\
389 - Oh, yeah.\\
390 - And she got some... Here it comes.\\
391 - Here it comes. Here it comes.\\
392 -     Men.    \\
393 - Berta, can you get the door?\\
394 - I'm off the clock, Zippy.\\
395 - What clock? You're a live-in.\\
396 - And I'm livin'.\\
397 - You know you took the wrong brother, right?\\
398 - Judith, what are you doing here?\\
399 - Why did you tell Jake he could quit school?\\
400 - I didn't.\\
401 - Well, then, where did he get the idea?\\
402 - Walden. He told him about how when he quit\\
403 - he made hundreds of millions of dollars,\\
404 - and now Jake thinks he can do it, too.\\
405 - Terrific. And I thought your brother\\
406 - was a horrible influence.\\
407 - Don't speak ill of the dead.\\
408 - But you're right-- he was a terrible human being.\\
409 - Hey, who's at the... Whoops!\\
410 - You come back here, young man!\\
411 - He's not coming back, is he?\\
412 - I wouldn't.\\
413 - Hey.\\
414 - Walden, I want a word with you.\\
415 - Walden, you remember Judith. Bye.\\
416 - You're Alan's ex, right?\\
417 - Yes, and Jake's mother.\\
418 - And you and I need to discuss how...\\
419 - I just had dinner with my ex.\\
420 - Well, that's very nice. Anyway...\\
421 - She's not my ex yet, but she's going to be.\\
422 - I'm sorry.\\
423 - She hates me, but I'm still in love with her.\\
424 - Well, I'm sure you'll find somebody else.\\
425 - Since we were teenagers, she's been the only one.\\
426 - You were high school sweethearts?\\
427 - Yeah.\\
428 - That is so romantic.\\
429 - And I blew it again tonight.\\
430 - Oh. Hey, come on now.\\
431 - It... it'll be okay.\\
432 - No, it'll never be okay.\\
433 - She's my soul mate.\\
434 - Oh, you poor, sweet man.\\
435 - Who smells like ranch dressing and fettuccine alfredo.\\
436 - Have you ever loved anyone like that?\\
437 - No.\\
438 - Don't, 'cause it hurts too much.\\
439 - Oh, I wish there was something I could do.\\
440 - Like what?\\
441 - Oh, yeah, I'm so quitting high school.\\
442 -     Men.    \\
443 -     Men.    \\
444 - For the last time, Jake,\\
445 - you're not dropping out of high school.\\
446 - What if I can convince Mom to let me?\\
447 - Sure.\\
448 - If your mother says it's okay, you can have my blessing.\\
449 - Cool.\\
450 - And while I'm at it, I'll buy you a car.\\
451 - Oh, no, no, a space ship.\\
452 - Car's fine.\\
453 - Good night, Jake.\\
454 - Good night, Dad.\\
455 - That... that was the air mattress.\\
456 - Okay.\\
457 - That was me.\\
458 - Holy moly.\\
459 - What got into you tonight?\\
460 - You know, besides moi.\\
461 - Shh. Don't talk.\\
462 - Okay.\\
463 - How would you feel about growing a beard?\\
464 - Wouldn't that scratch your face?\\
465 - Yeah.\\

1 - Previously on Two and a Half Men...\\
2 - I don't want to get a divorce.\\
3 - Why we got to get a divorce?\\
4 - Because I have grown up\\
5 - and you are still the same guy you were at 19.\\
6 - No, that is not true.\\
7 - I got a lot more money now.\\
8 - Not about what you have; it's about who you are.\\
9 - Oh.\\
10 - Well, I'm pretty much the same guy.\\
11 - Great news, Alan.\\
12 - Berta has agreed to be my live-in housekeeper.\\
13 - Yeah, he talked me into it.\\
14 - I wonder what his sweat tastes like.\\
15 - Time for me to go.\\
16 - Wait.\\
17 - Come here.\\
18 - Give us a hug good-bye.\\
19 - I'm taking your room, Zippy.\\
20 - You saved my butt back there.\\
21 - I owe you big time.\\
22 - If there is anything that you need,\\
23 - any way I can help you...\\
24 - Well, really uncomfortable living at my mom's.\\
25 - Um, do you think I could stay here for a few days\\
26 - till I find my own place?\\
27 - Yeah, no problem.\\
28 - I'm back.\\
29 - Hello, room.\\
30 - Did you miss me?\\
31 - Whoa! Whoa!\\
32 - What the hell are you doing here?\\
33 - I live here. What the hell are you doing here?\\
34 - Um, see, Berta's got my room now, so...\\
35 - - No. - Yes.\\
36 - - No. - It's just temporary.\\

44 - Good morning.\\
45 - Morning.\\
46 - Where you been?\\
47 - Little power walk on the beach.\\
48 - Got to tell you, Zip,\\
49 - I can see why your brother couldn't get you\\
50 - out of this house with the jaws of life.\\
51 - Malibu is the greatest place\\
52 - to wake up in the morning.\\
53 - I'm glad you're enjoying my room.\\
54 - Alan, I say this with love.\\
55 - It was never your room.\\
56 - Morning.\\
57 - Ah... did I miss our power walk?\\
58 - I tried to cuddle you awake,\\
59 - but you weren't interested. Oh.\\
60 - So, Alan, how's the house hunting coming?\\
61 - Oh, still looking. Uh, not a lot available.\\
62 - Maybe that's 'cause you're looking in the sports section.\\
63 - Well, don't worry.\\
64 - You can stay here as long as you need to.\\
65 - Aw!\\
66 - Oh, just a... a few more days.\\
67 - Maybe a week tops.\\
68 - Aw.\\
69 - Hey, uh, listen, Walden, um, while I am here,\\
70 - I was wondering how you would feel\\
71 - about me having an overnight guest.\\
72 - Aw.\\
73 - I thought you were the overnight guest.\\
74 - (laughing)\\
75 - Your wit is only exceeded by your generosity.\\
76 - Um, the thing is,\\
77 - I'm having dinner tonight with this woman\\
78 - I used to be in a relationship with.\\
79 - And I don't know how things are going to play out,\\
80 - but if they go well, I'd like to bring her back here\\
81 - and, uh, you know...\\
82 - reconcile.\\
83 - Is she homeless, too?\\
84 - Oh, oh, no, no, it-it's just that she has a teenage son,\\
85 - and I'm not really keen on him hearing us, you know...\\
86 - reconcile.\\
87 - But it's okay for me to hear you?\\
88 - Oh, don't worry, we'll be quiet.\\
89 - And quick.\\
90 - It's true. That's why she calls me Zippy.\\
91 - I guess it's okay.\\
92 - I sure wish I could reconcile with Bridget.\\
93 - Oh, give her some time.\\
94 - Took Lyndsey months to forgive me.\\
95 - What'd she have to forgive you for?\\
96 - Oh... I, uh... I called her a slut\\
97 - because, uh, I thought she was sleeping with my brother,\\
98 - uh, and I, uh... I accidentally burned down her house.\\
99 - Well, not in that order.\\

115 - He fell in front of a train?\\
116 - Uh, fell, pushed, jumped.\\
117 - Whatever the verb, the end result was Charlie tartare.\\
118 - That's horrible.\\
119 - Yeah.\\
120 - And we had to sell the house in Malibu.\\
121 - So where are you living?\\
122 - The house in Malibu.\\
123 - Wait, what?\\
124 - Oh, it's actually a funny story.\\
125 - Um, the fellow who bought it\\
126 - is this incredibly rich Internet guy\\
127 - who's going through a bad divorce,\\
128 - and he's lonely, he needs a friend,\\
129 - so he asked me to stick around for a while.\\
130 - What's the funny part?\\
131 - He actually thinks I'm going to leave someday.\\
132 - So, uh, how's things? How's Eldridge?\\
133 - Let's not ruin the evening by talking about our children.\\
134 - (chuckles) Agreed.\\
135 - I have missed you.\\
136 - I've missed you, too.\\
137 - Can you ever forgive me for being such an idiot?\\
138 - Let's not ruin the evening\\
139 - by talking about what an idiot you were.\\
140 - Good idea.\\
141 - You know, I haven't slept with anybody since we broke up.\\
142 - How about you?\\
143 - You know what?\\
144 - Let's not ruin the evening by talking.\\
145 -     Men.    \\
146 - (knock at door)\\
147 - I got it.\\
148 - Hello, little girl.\\
149 - Hi, big daddy. You got everything?\\
150 - Hell, yeah.\\
151 - Beer, bucket of drumsticks\\
152 - and nine magic fingers.\\
153 - (both laughing)\\
154 - Let's go.\\
155 - Uh, Berta?\\
156 - What's going on?\\
157 - What's it look like?\\
158 - I'm going to get drunk, eat some chicken\\
159 - and rock this old man's world.\\
160 - (laughing)\\
161 - I got ten fingers and a billion dollars,\\
162 - and this guy's getting more action than me.\\
163 - (chiming)\\
164 - What now, Walden?\\
165 - Nothing. I just wanted to say hi.\\
166 - (sighs) Sweetheart, listen to me.\\
167 - We're getting divorced.\\
168 - You need to get some friends, get a life.\\
169 - I don't want friends. I don't want a life.\\
170 - I just want you.\\
171 - What... what are you doing anyway?\\
172 - Why... why are those people wearing masks?\\
173 - I'm at a charity event for people without faces.\\
174 - Are you at an orgy?\\
175 - An orgy?\\
176 - Don't be ridiculous.\\
177 - What kind of charity has an orgy?\\
178 - Bye.\\
179 - BERTA: You know, a real gentleman\\
180 - would've taken his poop before he came over.\\
181 - (both giggling)\\
182 - Hello!\\
183 - Oh, I'm sorry. I-I didn't know you were still up.\\
184 - You must be Walden. I'm Lyndsey.\\
185 - Oh. Hi.\\
186 - Okay, uh, everybody's met.\\
187 - Time to hit the old sackaroo.\\
188 - Don't be rude, Alan.\\
189 - So, I understand you're going through a tough divorce.\\
190 - Yeah, it's tough for me.\\
191 - She's breezing through it with naked, faceless people.\\
192 - Have you guys tried to work things out, go to therapy?\\
193 - I offered. She's not interested.\\
194 - Well, that's all you can do-- make the offer.\\
195 - Lyndsey?\\
196 - Hang on.\\
197 - So what, you're just sitting around\\
198 - feeling sorry for yourself?\\
199 - No. Sometimes I lay down.\\
200 - Sometimes I curl up in a ball.\\
201 - See, he's fine.\\
202 - Listen to me.\\
203 - We just met, we don't know each other,\\
204 - but you obviously have a lot going for you.\\
205 - You're tall, good-looking,\\
206 - very successful.\\
207 - Believe me, women settle for a lot less.\\
208 - And thank God for that.\\
209 - You need to get out there and find somebody\\
210 - who appreciates all that you have to offer.\\
211 - I don't want anybody else.\\
212 - That's just because you haven't found that special someone.\\
213 - Believe me, somewhere out there is the perfect girl for you.\\
214 - Who knows?\\
215 - She could be sitting right in front of you.\\
216 - Gee, I'd like to believe that.\\
217 - So would I.\\
218 - You know... you know, Lyndsey's right.\\
219 - You need to go out and find Ms. Right.\\
220 - I mean, in fact, you should get started immediately.\\
221 - Now?\\
222 - No, I was just gonna curl up in a ball.\\
223 - Oh, come on. There's a great, big, wide world out there\\
224 - full of beautiful, exciting, sexy people.\\
225 - Where am I going to find them, a bar?\\
226 - I am not going to a bar.\\
227 - Hey, if you're looking for honey,\\
228 - you got to go where the bees are.\\
229 - (buzzing)\\
230 - Forget it.\\
231 - I am not going to a bar.\\
232 - Hey, slick.\\
233 - Where do you keep the plunger?\\
234 - I am going to a bar.\\
235 -     Men.    \\
236 - (both panting)\\
237 - Whoa.\\
238 - Hi-ho, Silver.\\
239 - I didn't hurt you, did I?\\
240 - A little, but I only need the one ball.\\
241 - Boy, you really seemed like a different woman.\\
242 - Well, you seemed like a different man.\\
243 - (knock at door)\\
244 - WALDEN: Hey, Alan?\\
245 - Speak of the devil.\\
246 - Hey. Am I interrupting?\\
247 - No. Come in.\\
248 - I just wanted to tell you that I found her.\\
249 - Found who?\\
250 - Ms. Right.\\
251 - Really?\\
252 - At a bar at... 12:30 on a Wednesday night?\\
253 - Is she on a leash?\\
254 - Woof.\\
255 -     Men.    \\
256 -     Men.    \\
257 - (Walden and Courtney grunting and moaning)\\
258 - Isn't that the girl who almost married your brother?\\
259 - Yep.\\
260 - Didn't she go to jail\\
261 - for being some kind of con artist?\\
262 - Yep.\\
263 - Doesn't it strike you\\
264 - as an amazing coincidence\\
265 - that she just ran into Walden?\\
266 - Nope.\\
267 - You have to warn him before he gets in too deep.\\
268 - (Courtney whooping)\\
269 - Sounds like he's already in too deep.\\
270 - Who's my hungry boy?\\
271 - Me.\\
272 - Who's my naughty boy?\\
273 - Me.\\
274 - Who's going to get their bottom spanked after breakfast?\\
275 - You.\\
276 - (gasps)\\
277 - You are so smart.\\
278 - Open.\\
279 - Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.\\
280 - No, wait, Alan, come back.\\
281 - We're just having breakfast.\\
282 - Scrambled eggs and tongue. Nice.\\
283 - Hey, Alan, I want to thank you.\\
284 - If you hadn't made me go out last night,\\
285 - I would have never met Courtney.\\
286 - You're welcome, but I have a feeling one way or another\\
287 - she would have found you.\\
288 - Oh, wait, hey, you know what would be fun?\\
289 - Whatever it is, I'll do it.\\
290 - You are something else.\\
291 - No, Walden, what would be fun?\\
292 - Oh, right.\\
293 - What I was gonna say is, why don't you and Lyndsey\\
294 - and me and Courtney all go out for dinner?\\
295 - Oh, gee, I'd have to check with Lyndsey.\\
296 - Oh, come on, man, like a big fancy dinner.\\
297 - It's sort of short notice.\\
298 - My treat. We'll be there.\\
299 - Alan, do you want to watch me and Walden having sex?\\
300 - No, not particularly.\\
301 - Then you'd better get out quick.\\
302 - WALDEN: Hot diggity, that feels good!\\
303 - I can't believe she's using I Can't Believe It's Not Butter.\\
304 -     Men.    \\
305 - Hello? Dad?\\
306 - Oh, yay.\\
307 - Hey, Courtney.\\
308 - Jake, it's so good to see you.\\
309 - You, too.\\
310 - Oh, you've grown.\\
311 - No, that's just my cell phone.\\
312 - Jake, what are you doing here?\\
313 - I just, uh...\\
314 - came by to...\\
315 - What?\\
316 - Look, could you do me a favor and give us some privacy?\\
317 - Yeah, sure. Can I have a good-bye hug?\\
318 - Jake, go.\\
319 - Way to block me, Dad.\\
320 - So, Courtney.\\
321 - So, Alan.\\
322 - Where's Walden?\\
323 - He's upstairs taking a nap.\\
324 - Recharge the batteries?\\
325 - The batteries are fine.\\
326 - It's the flashlight that needs a rest.\\
327 - What can I do for you?\\
328 - I want you to leave Walden alone.\\
329 - He's not ready for someone like you.\\
330 - Someone like me?\\
331 - What ever do you mean?\\
332 - Someone who's creating a lifestyle\\
333 - from finding wealthy men\\
334 - and sponging off them as much as they can.\\
335 - Gee, Alan, that sounds a lot like you.\\
336 - What ever do you mean?\\
337 - Eight years living off your brother,\\
338 - sleeping on his fold-out couch.\\
339 - Oh, leave it to you to spin it so I look bad.\\
340 - See you at dinner, Alan.\\
341 - Oh, I will see you at dinner all right, young lady.\\
342 -     Men.    \\
343 - Ugh, gristle.\\
344 - Aw, here honey, let me cut that fat away for you.\\
345 - Thank you.\\
346 - Bit of a fatty piece here myself.\\
347 - Yeah, so?\\
348 - Oh, you got a little schmutz.\\
349 - Thank you.\\
350 - So, looks like you two guys hit it off pretty quick.\\
351 - What's the point of going slow?\\
352 - When it's right, it's right.\\
353 - - And it is right, right? - Right.\\
354 - Hey, I finished my beans. Can I have dessert?\\
355 - I am dessert.\\
356 - Thank you.\\
357 - WALDEN: Hey.\\
358 - - Hmm? - You know what would be cool?\\
359 - What? Move in with me.\\
360 - Whoa, slow down, Walden.\\
361 - Yeah, slow down, Walden. You just met her last night.\\
362 - Yeah, but I want to be with her all the time.\\
363 - Oh, baby, that is so sweet, but is there even room for me?\\
364 - What about Alan?\\
365 - Yeah, what about Alan?\\
366 - But he's moving out, right?\\
367 - Right.\\
368 - I don't know. I'm not really the kind of girl\\
369 - who just moves in with a guy after one night.\\
370 - Please.\\
371 - Okay.\\
372 - Well, I guess I need to find a new place to live.\\
373 - Yeah, good luck with that.\\
374 -     Men.    \\
375 - Morning, Alan.\\
376 - Morning.\\
377 - Where's your little girlfriend?\\
378 - She couldn't sleep, so she went home.\\
379 - What was the problem?\\
380 - I think it was hearing the third\\
381 - "Hot diggity, that feels good!"\\
382 - Oh, yeah, number three was a well-timed ice cube.\\
383 - You think you've beaten me, don't you?\\
384 - Alan, it was never a contest.\\
385 - Of the two of us, only I can bring the "diggity."\\
386 - (doorbell ringing)\\
387 - Don't be so sure of yourself.\\
388 - I may have a final card to play.\\
389 - Well, unless that card is a vagina in your pocket,\\
390 - I'm not particularly worried.\\
391 - Oh, thanks for coming, Bridget.\\
392 - Well, you said Walden was in trouble.\\
393 - Hi, I'm the trouble Walden's been in. Repeatedly.\\
394 - Uh, Courtney, this is Walden's wife Bridget.\\
395 - Bridget, this is the "lad"" I was telling you about.\\
396 - WALDEN: Bridget?\\
397 - What are you doing here?\\
398 - Well, Alan called and told me\\
399 - that you were doing something stupid.\\
400 - And I just met her.\\
401 - She's just sorry\\
402 - she threw you out, but it's too late now,\\
403 - isn't it, baby? WALDEN: Really?\\
404 - You're sorry you threw me out?\\
405 - Who cares? Come upstairs.\\
406 - Walden, just because I can't live with you anymore,\\
407 - doesn't mean that I want you\\
408 - to be taken to the cleaners by Botox Barbie here.\\
409 - Don't listen to her. Come upstairs.\\
410 - Walden, if you go with her, I will never talk to you again.\\
411 - Why don't both you broads hold out a treat and whistle\\
412 - and we'll see which one he goes to.\\
413 - Boy, this is a toughie.\\
414 - I really love having a life with you.\\
415 - Sharing my hopes\\
416 - and dreams.\\
417 - But I also really love\\
418 - burying my head in your breasts and going (motorboat noise).\\
419 - Honey, it's not about the sex.\\
420 - It's not about your money.\\
421 - I want to be with you.\\
422 - I want to take care of you.\\
423 - Oh, that's a good answer.\\
424 - Bridget?\\
425 - We have a winner!\\
426 - Courtney, do you think that your deep feelings for my husband\\
427 - can in any way be affected\\
428 - by a cashier's check for $50,000?\\
429 - (whimpering): $50,000?\\
430 - You actually think that you can buy me off?\\
431 - Your real name is Sylvia Fishman and you're wanted\\
432 - in three states for fraud, forgery and money laundering.\\
433 - Bye, Walden. It was fun.\\
434 - Aw, darn.\\
435 - I was really looking forward to more diggity.\\
436 - If Bridget will write me a check like that,\\
437 - I'll diggity your brains out.\\
438 - I'll diggity you for free.\\
439 -     Men.    \\
440 -     Men.    \\
441 - How you doing?\\
442 - Let this be a warning to you, Alan.\\
443 - There are women out there that will be nice to you\\
444 - just to get to your money.\\
445 - Thanks.\\
446 - But that's not very high on my list of concerns.\\
447 - I just feel so stupid.\\
448 - Oh, hey. Don't sell yourself short.\\
449 - I'm sure she was also attracted to your chiseled good looks,\\
450 - youthful stamina and freakishly large penis.\\
451 - Thanks. That makes me feel better.\\
452 - I'm glad, 'cause it makes me feel like hanging myself.\\
453 - So how'd you leave things with Bridget?\\
454 - Pretty much the same place.\\
455 - She still wants a divorce.\\
456 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
457 - But she obviously still cares about you.\\
458 - I mean, a lot of people would have used\\
459 - the money she gave Courtney for--\\
460 - I don't know-- medical insurance, a new car,\\
461 - maybe a college prep tutor for their idiot son.\\
462 - You can have all those things, Alan.\\
463 - I can?\\
464 - Sure. You just have to make more money.\\
465 - Right.\\
466 - Duh.\\
467 - Hey, thanks for calling Bridget.\\
468 - Oh, no problem.\\
469 - No, you really had my back.\\
470 - Oh, that's what friends do.\\
471 - Well, I want you to know that you have\\
472 - a home here as long as you want.\\
473 - Really?\\
474 - Because I am looking for a place.\\
475 - No, I want... I want you to stay.\\
476 - I like having somebody here I can trust.\\
477 - Well, if it's what you want.\\
478 - BERTA: Ah, son of a bitch.\\
479 - I knew you'd find a way\\
480 - to weasel your way back in.\\
481 - I'm out of here.\\
482 - Well, you're not quitting, are you?\\
483 - Nah, I'm moving back home.\\
484 - I'll see you Monday.\\
485 - Wow. (chuckles)\\
486 - Looks like I get to take my old room back, huh?\\
487 - Hey, whatever you want, buddy.\\
488 - Just make sure the nine-fingered man is gone.\\
489 - How about that?\\
490 - For once, things actually work out well for old Alan.\\
491 - (chuckles)\\

1 -     Men.    \\
2 - Ready, sweetheart?\\
3 - Almost.\\
4 - Okay.\\
5 - Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.\\
6 - Oh, dinner's sitting a little heavy.\\
7 - Well, maybe I can help you work it off.\\
8 - Yeah, about that--\\
9 - honey, would you mind terribly if we just go to sleep?\\
10 - I'm so full and bloated from that dinner,\\
11 - it'd be like sticking a pin in a balloon.\\
12 - Can we not call it a pin?\\
13 - I'm sorry.\\
14 - I just don't think I'd enjoy sex tonight.\\
15 - Since when is that a requirement?\\
16 - But seriously, it's fine.\\
17 - It's no problem.\\
18 - Thank you.\\
19 - Ugh.\\
20 - Well, actually, it is a little bit of problem.\\
21 - What's that?\\
22 - Well, uh, based on past history--\\
23 - um, expensive dinner, drinks, valet parking--\\
24 - um, I thought\\
25 - we would probably be fooling around tonight.\\
26 - Uh, and-and-and with that in mind,\\
27 - uh, about 20 minutes ago, I popped a little blue pill\\
28 - to ensure that, uh,\\
29 - when you were ready, so was I.\\
30 - Of course, uh, now I'm ready and you're not,\\
31 - a situation they didn't really cover in those commercials.\\
32 - Oh, Alan.\\
33 - No, that's okay. It's okay.\\
34 - It's just kind of a shame to waste them.\\
35 - I mean, they-they are kind of pricey,\\
36 - even if they're expired ones from Mexico.\\
37 - If I give you $20, will you let me go to sleep?\\
38 - Oh, don't be silly.\\
39 - I don't want your money.\\
40 - But there are...\\
41 - other ways you could reimburse me\\
42 - that wouldn't require a lot of effort on your part.\\
43 - Should've taken the 20 bucks.\\
44 - Oh, hey.\\
45 - Oh, hey, Alan.\\
46 - Want some whiskey?\\
47 - I thought you didn't like to drink.\\
48 - I don't.\\
49 - I'm trying to learn.\\
50 - I'm getting better.\\
51 - Is this about your ex-wife?\\
52 - No. Walden.\\
53 - Maybe. Walden.\\
54 - Yes.\\
55 - All right, all right.\\
56 - Listen to me.\\
57 - Alcohol is just a bandage for your problems.\\
58 - And I know this\\
59 - because I used to live with the Mummy.\\
60 - Uh... come on.\\
61 - We, uh... we got to get your mind off of her.\\
62 - Let's, uh... let's watch some TV.\\
63 - Bridget and I used to watch TV.\\
64 - That's the spirit.\\
65 - Okay, let's see what's on.\\
66 - Oh.\\
67 - Cinnamon's Buns.\\
68 - "A medieval wench falls for a bawdy baker.\\
69 - Adult. 1992."\\
70 - Ooh, a selection from the classic era\\
71 - of soft-core cable porn.\\
72 - Or what I like to call the winter bush years.\\
73 - I haven't watched much porn since college.\\
74 - Yeah, me, neither.\\
75 - When I see it now, I just feel bad for the girls.\\
76 - Yeah, yeah, somebody's daughter. Shh.\\
77 - Are you ready to learn my craft?\\
78 - Of course, Master Baker.\\
79 - I am entirely in your hands.\\
80 - This is not historically accurate.\\
81 - Medieval bakers did not dress like Chef Boyardee.\\
82 - Don't need the DVD commentary here.\\
83 - Sorry.\\
84 - Now, Cinnamon,\\
85 - take my frosting bag.\\
86 - It's so big.\\
87 - I can barely get my hand around it.\\
88 - Use both hands, m'lady.\\
89 - It's well written.\\
90 - Like this?\\
91 - Now, squeeze,\\
92 - and anoint thy muffins with my frosting.\\
93 - Boy, she looks familiar.\\
94 - Yeah, she does.\\
95 - If I wasn't here, would you be masturbating?\\
96 - You kidding? I'd be done and fixing a sandwich.\\
97 - Master Baker, whatever are you doing?\\
98 - I'm going to put my loaf in your oven.\\
99 - That's clever.\\
100 - I don't know.\\
101 - She looks like a younger version of your girlfriend.\\
102 - Lyndsey? Uh-huh.\\
103 - Oh, nah.\\
104 - Oh, oh, you're so masterful!\\
105 - Kind of sounds like her, too.\\
106 - Maybe.\\
107 - Although I can't say I've ever heard Lyndsey\\
108 - use that particular phrase.\\
109 - Don't stop! I can't get enough!\\
110 - Or that one.\\
111 - Maybe if I heard her say, "Damn it, get off my hair."\\
112 - I don't know, Alan.\\
113 - I think that's your girlfriend.\\
114 - No, no.\\
115 - Yes! Yes!\\
116 - No. No.\\
117 - Yes! Yes!\\
118 - Oh, God! Oh, God!\\
119 - Oh, God!\\
120 - Boy, she's not very convincing.\\
121 - It is Lyndsey.\\
122 - Okay, I'm going to go upstairs and masturbate.\\
123 - Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\\
124 - You're... you're going to go\\
125 - pleasure yourself while you're thinking about my girlfriend?\\
126 - No, that'd be creepy.\\
127 - I'm going to go pleasure myself\\
128 - while I'm thinking about my wife.\\
129 - Wait. Your... your wife? Seriously?\\
130 - Yeah, what can I say? I love Bridget,\\
131 - and I think she's the sexiest woman in the whole world.\\
132 - Uh, you never fantasize about anybody else?\\
133 - Mmm, sometimes I imagine she's twins.\\
134 - Boo-ya!\\
135 - I never even thought of my wife\\
136 - when I was actually having sex with my wife.\\
137 - Oh, Master Baker!\\
138 - Boy, she never let me do that to her.\\

152 - It's okay. I did offer this morning.\\
153 - Can't expect me to turn on like a light switch\\
154 - whenever the whim strikes you.\\
155 - I'm not just a piece of meat, you know.\\
156 - You're kidding, right?\\
157 - In the entire time I've known you,\\
158 - you've never once passed up an opportunity for sex.\\
159 - So as not to hurt your feelings, sometimes my mouth says, "Yes,"\\
160 - when my soul is screaming, "No""\\
161 - Oh, please!\\
162 - I can't even bend over to take off my shoes\\
163 - without you trying to mount me.\\
164 - Hey, hey, that was an accident.\\
165 - I was trying to walk and text.\\
166 - You were texting, "Here comes Mr. Pokey."\\
167 - Morning.\\
168 - Morning. Morning.\\
169 - We'll talk later.\\
170 - About Mr. Pokey?\\
171 - I was speaking to Lyndsey.\\
172 - Sounds like a short conversation.\\
173 - I should have my own talk show.\\
174 - Okay.\\
175 - I've got to get to work.\\
176 - I'll call you later?\\
177 - If you want.\\
178 - Bye, Berta.\\
179 - You're an attractive woman.\\
180 - You don't have to settle.\\
181 - I mean, bye!\\
182 - So, trouble in paradise?\\
183 - Why on Earth do you think\\
184 - I would share my problems with you?\\
185 - Oh, come on.\\
186 - I may tease you now and then, but that doesn't mean\\
187 - that I don't care about you as a human being.\\
188 - All right.\\
189 - What do you do when you're in\\
190 - a relationship with someone and, you know,\\
191 - like all relationships, it...\\
192 - it has its ups and downs, but...\\
193 - generally, things are going pretty good\\
194 - until one day you discover\\
195 - that they are not at all who you thought they were?\\
196 - And you don't know whether to confront them about it or...\\
197 - or pretend you don't know,\\
198 - because the idea of being alone is worse\\
199 - than being with someone who's deceived you.\\
200 - Berta?\\
201 - Hello?\\
202 - Turns out I don't care.\\
203 - Morning.\\
204 - Morning.\\
205 - Hey, I was thinking\\
206 - about your girlfriend's porno movie.\\
207 - Me, too. What about it?\\
208 - I want to learn to bake.\\
209 - What?\\
210 - I think it'd be fun.\\
211 - You know, cookies and cupcakes, pie, bread.\\
212 - That's what you took from watching two people\\
213 - get it on in a 16th century kitchen?\\
214 - Well, I already know how to have sex.\\
215 - How do you make buttermilk biscuits?\\
216 - There's a mystery.\\
217 -     Men.    \\
218 - Hey.\\
219 - We need to talk.\\
220 - Is everything okay?\\
221 - Not really. Can I come in?\\
222 - Sure.\\
223 - What's going on?\\
224 - Okay, I don't know how to say this\\
225 - except just to say it.\\
226 - Oh, God, are you still upset\\
227 - about not getting laid last night?\\
228 - I'm still upset about not getting laid in high school.\\
229 - But that's not what I want to talk about.\\
230 - Um, last night, after you went to sleep,\\
231 - I turned on the TV and stumbled on\\
232 - a little motion picture you appeared in.\\
233 - You saw Cinnamon's Buns.\\
234 - I saw Cinnamon's buns. I saw Cinnamon's boobs.\\
235 - I saw the little birthmark\\
236 - on the inside of Cinnamon's thigh.\\
237 - Oh, God.\\
238 - I mean, one minute I-I'm dating\\
239 - a soccer mom from Sherman Oaks,\\
240 - and the next minute a porn star on Cinemax.\\
241 - I'm not a porn star.\\
242 - It was a little nudity.\\
243 - And simulated sex.\\
244 - Most of it.\\
245 - Mo-most of it?\\
246 - It was 20 years ago, Alan.\\
247 - I-I was young, stupid and needed the money.\\
248 - Well, why didn't you tell me about it?\\
249 - Oh, yeah, right. Who wouldn't be\\
250 - looking forward to this conversation?\\
251 - Well, I... I just feel like such an idiot.\\
252 - You feel like an idiot?\\
253 - That casting director said he could get me on Melrose Place.\\
254 - I'm sorry.\\
255 - I should have told you.\\
256 - Any other secrets you'd like to share with me?\\
257 - Wait a second.\\
258 - That's a two-way street.\\
259 - Do you have any secrets you want to tell me?\\
260 - Me? I'm an open book.\\
261 - Great. Chapter one.\\
262 - What have you done that you're ashamed of\\
263 - and don't want anyone to know about?\\
264 - All right.\\
265 - Um... when I was a little boy,\\
266 - um, we had a dog named Rusty,\\
267 - um, who loved peanut butter,\\
268 - and, uh,\\
269 - my brother, uh, convinced me\\
270 - that the best way to feed him, uh,\\
271 - was to, uh, uh, smear it on my testicles.\\
272 - Um...\\
273 - No surprise, that dog got very, very fat.\\
274 - Um...\\
275 -     Men.    \\
276 - So, long story short, I kissed the guy.\\
277 - Because, you know, how else would I know\\
278 - whether or not I was gay?\\
279 - What did you decide?\\
280 - Well, I may love Broadway musicals\\
281 - and have an eye for fashion, but that's where it stops.\\
282 - Okay.\\
283 - Let's recap the highlights.\\
284 - You embezzled money from your family,\\
285 - you cheated on me with an old girlfriend,\\
286 - - Mm-hmm. - you might be the father\\
287 - of Judith and Herb's baby,\\
288 - you didn't tell your late brother that the woman\\
289 - he was chasing was married to a mannequin\\
290 - because she gave you $50,000 to keep it a secret.\\
291 - And to top it all off,\\
292 - you gave the family dog type 2 diabetes.\\
293 - Oh, wait, one more thing.\\
294 - Those diamond earrings I got you for your birthday last year...\\
295 - Let me guess. They're not real.\\
296 - Oh, no, they're real.\\
297 - Uh, it's just, I kind of stole them from my ex-wife.\\
298 - You know, it really feels good to get all this off my chest.\\
299 - Okay, now your turn.\\
300 - Probably shouldn't have gone first.\\
301 -     Men.    \\
302 -     Men.    \\
303 - I'm so glad I learned to bake.\\
304 - I'm so glad I'm baked.\\
305 - Hey.\\
306 - What are you doing?\\
307 - Oh... I'm baking brownies\\
308 - and Berta is making my head into a dreamcatcher.\\
309 - I'm guessing it was Berta's recipe.\\
310 - It was!\\
311 - But I did the baking, because I am a master baker now.\\
312 - That was funny.\\
313 - You should be a guest on my talk show.\\
314 - I'm in.\\
315 - Well, I have done something incredibly stupid.\\
316 - Whatever you do, don't say "what?"\\
317 - What?\\
318 - Lyndsey and I split up.\\
319 - Oh, no. What happened?\\
320 - Well, I made the mistake\\
321 - of thinking honesty is the best policy.\\
322 - It is a good policy.\\
323 - You know, another good policy?\\
324 - Give a hoot, don't pollute.\\
325 - Zippy, the only time in this world\\
326 - you want to be completely honest\\
327 - is when the paramedics ask, "What did you take?"\\
328 - Two brownies and a peach Snapple.\\
329 - Snapple.\\
330 - Snapple.\\
331 - Okay.\\
332 - Well, it's been real nice talking at the two of you.\\
333 - Where you going?\\
334 - Uh, I need a little time to be alone.\\
335 - Okay.\\
336 - G'bye-bye!\\
337 - Man, it is hard when the person you love doesn't love you back.\\
338 - You don't have to love me.\\
339 - What?\\
340 - You heard me, Mr. Master Baker.\\
341 -     Men.    \\
342 - Hi, Lyndsey.\\
343 - Uh, it's me again.\\
344 - Um, you don't have to call me back,\\
345 - but I just want you to know that the only reason\\
346 - that I was so honest with you\\
347 - is because I care about you and I trust you.\\
348 - And a lot of those things I've never told anybody,\\
349 - and I'd appreciate it if you didn't, either.\\
350 - Um...\\
351 - Especially the peanut butter and the dog.\\
352 - I got enough problems without the ASPCA on my ass.\\
353 - Um, anyway, I-I love you and I miss you,\\
354 - and I'm-I'm sorry I made such a big deal\\
355 - about your film career.\\
356 - And for what it's worth,\\
357 - um, I got a really big kick out of seeing your original breasts.\\
358 - Okay. Bye-bye.\\
359 - Oh, she's gonna take that last part wrong.\\
360 - Hey, Alan, come here quick!\\
361 - Hurry!\\
362 - Oh, what fresh hell is this?\\
363 - Surprise!\\
364 - What's... what's going on?\\
365 - It's a party to cheer you up.\\
366 - Hey, Alan, say hello to\\
367 - the Malibu College beach volleyball team.\\
368 - Hi!\\
369 - Hello.\\
370 - Here, Alan, have a brownie.\\
371 - They're mmm-mmm good.\\
372 - Gee, Walden, I really appreciate this,\\
373 - but it's a little soon for me to be partying.\\
374 - I'm still hurting over Lyndsey.\\
375 - But what am I gonna do with all these incredibly hot girls\\
376 - in bikinis that are in the process\\
377 - of getting stoned out of their minds?\\
378 - You're right, I'm being thoughtless.\\
379 - Alan's here!\\
380 -     Men.    \\
381 - Do I look delicious?\\
382 - 'Cause I feel delicious.\\
383 - Hey, Zip, I'm home.\\
384 - Where you been?\\
385 - Not a clue.\\
386 - Whoa, I just saw a giant cat holding a churro.\\
387 - If that's a giant mouse, he's in big trouble.\\
388 - Hey, it's Cinnamon!\\
389 - Oh, God, you saw it, too?\\
390 - Yeah, just a little.\\
391 - Then I went upstairs to masturbate.\\
392 - Terrific.\\
393 - Is Alan here?\\
394 - Um...\\
395 - I don't think so.\\
396 - Let me check.\\
397 - You said Alan, right?\\
398 - Right.\\
399 - Hold on.\\
400 - All right, all right.\\
401 - Ladies, have you got your spoons?\\
402 - Well, get rid of them.\\
403 - We are eating freestyle!\\
404 - Uh, excuse me.\\
405 - Wait. Hey. Whoa!\\
406 - Hey, what are you doing?\\
407 - You'll thank me later.\\
408 - I can fly!\\
409 - Oh!\\
410 - No, I can't.\\
411 - You said Alan, right?\\
412 - Right.\\
413 - He's not here.\\
414 - Are you having some sort of a party in there?\\
415 - Oh, no, it's just a bunch of stoned girls dancing.\\
416 - G'bye-bye!\\
417 - Works better with an oven mitt.\\
418 - Walden!\\
419 - Oh, hey, Alan.\\
420 - You look ucky.\\
421 - Was that Lyndsey?\\
422 - Yeah. I told her you were not here.\\
423 - I was not here because you threw me off the deck.\\
424 - No, I threw you off the deck so you would not be here.\\
425 - Wouldn't it have been easier to just skip the throwing\\
426 - and tell her I'm not here?\\
427 - Next time.\\
428 - Oh! Hey.\\
429 - Great news, we got a cat.\\
430 -     Men.    \\
431 -     Men.    \\
432 - So I thought about it, and I decided\\
433 - that I really can't fault you for opening up to me.\\
434 - I mean, every good relationship has got to be based on honesty.\\
435 - Well, I'm glad you feel that way.\\
436 - By the way, where were you when I came over to the house?\\
437 - Well... honesty, right?\\
438 - Right.\\
439 - I'm such a schmuck!\\

2 - So you're not paying any rent at all?\\
3 - Walden doesn't want my money, we're friends.\\
4 - Wow. I can't wait till I grow up and find a friend\\
5 - of my own to live off of.\\
6 - That's my dream for you.\\
7 - Mail's here.\\
8 - Whoa!\\
9 - - Whoa! - Whoa!\\
10 - Hey!\\
11 - Uh, Walden, are you feeling okay?\\
12 - Yeah, fine. Why?\\
13 - Your junk's all over the couch, dude.\\
14 - Yeah, so?\\
15 - It's my house, my couch, my junk.\\
16 - Fair point.\\
17 - Remember, we're guests.\\
18 - I thought we were friends.\\
19 - What is this?\\
20 - Package for "Alan Smith" from "Penis Pump Industries."\\
21 - Nobody here by that name.\\
22 - I'll just... I'll take this back to the post office.\\
23 - Oh boy, perfect.\\
24 - What?\\
25 - It's my divorce papers from Bridget.\\
26 - Oh, oh, I'm sorry, man.\\
27 - I remember getting my divorce papers.\\
28 - That was a sad, sad day.\\
29 - Remember, Jake?\\
30 - I wasn't with you, I was with Mom.\\
31 - She had a party on a boat.\\
32 - You gonna be okay?\\
33 - Yeah, I'm fine.\\
34 - I guess I knew it was coming.\\
35 - Well, that's a very healthy attitude.\\
36 - Of course, I was hoping she'd change her mind.\\
37 - But if I had hope in one hand and poop in the other,\\
38 - guess which hand would be full?\\
39 - The poop hand?\\
40 - Bingo.\\
41 - Yes.\\
42 - Well, my marriage is over.\\
43 - Big deal.\\
44 - It's only the final death knell\\
45 - of the most meaningful relationship of my life.\\
46 - Bong.\\
47 - That was a knell.\\
48 - But you're young.\\
49 - I'm sure you'll find someone else eventually.\\
50 - Yeah, yeah, I mean, sure.\\
51 - It's easy to find a soul mate.\\
52 - Heck, you practically trip over them everywhere you turn.\\
53 - Oh, look, a soul mate!\\
54 - Oh, jeepers, there's another soul mate!\\
55 - Everywhere I look it's another soul mate.\\
56 - No, it's a great day.\\
57 - It's just another fabulous day in the life of Walden Schmidt.\\

75 - If I'm going to forget Bridget and start a new life,\\
76 - I got to get rid of the old one.\\
77 - Uh-huh. So, uh, so this is all...\\
78 - Wedding photos and love letters.\\
79 - Right, right.\\
80 - Oh, this is from our second date.\\
81 - "I am bananas over you."\\
82 - Isn't that adorable?\\
83 - Burn in Hell, little monkey.\\
84 - This-- wedding video.\\
85 - Honeymoon video.\\
86 - Oh, maybe I'll keep that one.\\
87 - Listen, I understand that you're very upset right now,\\
88 - but there may come a time\\
89 - when you'll regret not having some of this stuff.\\
90 - You still have your wedding photos?\\
91 - Well, the half that she gave me.\\
92 - And by half, I mean half of each picture.\\
93 - Yeah, well, I don't want any mementos.\\
94 - In fact, I don't even want to think about Bridget anymore.\\
95 - I am wiping the hard drive.\\
96 - Okay. I'm rebooting the system.\\
97 - Whatever makes you happy. And to really get a clean start,\\
98 - I'm going to sell this place and move to New York.\\
99 - With the possible exception of that.\\
100 - Why?\\
101 - What do you mean why?\\
102 - If you sell the place, I wouldn't be able to live...\\
103 - ...with myself.\\
104 - If I didn't encourage you to reconsider,\\
105 - and maybe talk to a professional.\\
106 - Like a shrink?\\
107 - This could all be a sign of clinical depression.\\
108 - I guess you would know.\\
109 - If you're interested, I could recommend a good psychiatrist.\\
110 - The one that my brother used to go to.\\
111 - Uh, your brother ended up dead.\\
112 - Well, yeah, that's 'cause a crazy woman\\
113 - pushed him in front of a train.\\
114 - You can't blame his shrink for that.\\
115 - If anything, blame the crazy woman's shrink.\\
116 - I guess I got nothing to lose, huh?\\
117 - I'm in.\\
118 - Okay. Well, I'll go get her number.\\
119 - Geez, being a parasitic leech is exhausting.\\
120 -     Men.    \\
121 - I'm sure you're aware that depression is often the result\\
122 - of repressed anger.\\
123 - I'm not angry.\\
124 - Well, I got to tell you, Walden,\\
125 - burning all the mementos and photographs from your marriage\\
126 - can be construed as an angry gesture.\\
127 - That's not an angry gesture. This is an angry gesture.\\
128 - Arr!\\
129 - That's a good one, too.\\
130 - Why don't we put your marriage on the back burner for now.\\
131 - Let's talk about your childhood.\\
132 - I had a very happy childhood.\\
133 - Filled with wonderful memories.\\
134 - Your parents still together?\\
135 - No, and I don't want to talk about it.\\
136 - All right, fine.\\
137 - My first childhood memory\\
138 - was my father disappearing when I was three.\\
139 - He abandoned you and your mother?\\
140 - No, he disappeared.\\
141 - He was an amateur magician and it was his signature trick.\\
142 - Oh.\\
143 - And then when I was four,\\
144 - he ran off with a lady sword swallower.\\
145 - At least that's what my mother called her.\\
146 - In retrospect, it might have been a euphemism.\\
147 - So what was your mother like?\\
148 - Well, after Dad left, she raised me by herself.\\
149 - And how was that?\\
150 - It was great.\\
151 - She did everything for me.\\
152 - And I always felt safe with her.\\
153 - That sounds wonderful.\\
154 - It was.\\
155 - And the saddest day of my life was when it ended.\\
156 - Why, what happened?\\
157 - I got married.\\
158 - Hello.\\
159 - How did your wife and your mother get along?\\
160 - Not very well. I don't know why, though.\\
161 - Maybe it was just 'cause they were so different.\\
162 - I see.\\
163 - Tell me more about your wife.\\
164 - Bridget?\\
165 - She's great.\\
166 - She did everything for me.\\
167 - And I always felt very safe with her.\\
168 - Oh, isn't that what I said about my mother?\\
169 - Oh, Walden, you went and beat me to it.\\
170 - I wonder if when we get right down to it,\\
171 - I married my mother.\\
172 - And we're off.\\
173 - What are we saying here?\\
174 - That Bridget's right and I am emotionally immature?\\
175 - And all those years\\
176 - I was treating her more like a mother than a wife?\\
177 - And how would that make you feel if that were true?\\
178 - That would make me feel very angry.\\
179 - And repressed anger is sometimes the cause of...\\
180 - Depression.\\
181 - Ta-da.\\
182 - Ta-da.\\
183 - That's the last thing my dad said before he disappeared.\\
184 - Is that it? Am I cured?\\
185 - Well, "cured" is one of those laymen's terms\\
186 - that we psychiatrists try to avoid.\\
187 - It hurts repeat business.\\
188 - Do I need to come back?\\
189 - I'm thinking three times a week.\\
190 - Well, I was going to leave town.\\
191 - Well, then you have a choice to make.\\
192 - You can stay here and make your problems go away,\\
193 - or you can go away with your problems.\\
194 - Well, that is going in my book.\\
195 - Okay, I need to know one more thing.\\
196 - When I was having sex with my wife,\\
197 - was I really having sex with my mother?\\
198 - I'm thinking double sessions.\\
199 - Monday, Wednesday, Thursday?\\
200 - What... You... Um, you don't work on Fridays?\\
201 - Not anymore.\\
202 - I'll see you next week.\\
203 - - Thank you, Dr. Freeman. - You're welcome.\\
204 - Oh, gosh. Okay, that's fine.\\
205 - Bye-bye now.\\
206 - Bye.\\
207 - Hmm, maybe I'm not gay.\\
208 - It turns out all these years, I've been trying to duplicate\\
209 - the good feelings I have for my mother with my wife.\\
210 - Oh, see, you lose me at good feelings toward my mother.\\
211 - Uh, I would like a jumbo hot dog,\\
212 - an extra large nachos and a super slushee.\\
213 - Um... you want anything?\\
214 - No, I'm good.\\
215 - Oh, come on, you treated me to the movie,\\
216 - let me treat you to a snack.\\
217 - Give my friend a small popcorn.\\
218 - Oh, God!\\
219 - What?\\
220 - It's my wife.\\
221 - Oh... Wow!\\
222 - That is one handsome man she's with.\\
223 - You think?\\
224 - Oh, yeah. He's gorgeous.\\
225 - He's better looking than me?\\
226 - Well, it's apples and oranges.\\
227 - I mean, you're prettier, but he's more...\\
228 - What do I do here?\\
229 - Well, the adult thing would be to say hello\\
230 - and meet her new fella, but I'm a big believer in\\
231 - yelling fire and escaping in the confusion.\\
232 - No, no. I'm going to be a grownup.\\
233 - Bridget!\\
234 - Hiya! Over here!\\
235 - Oh, Lord.\\
236 - The closer he gets, the better he looks.\\
237 - Uh, Walden, this is Alex. Alex, Walden.\\
238 - Heard a lot about you.\\
239 - Yeah? Did you hear about my giant penis?\\
240 - I smell smoke. Does anybody else smell smoke?\\
241 - Hey, Alan, Hi.\\
242 - Hey.\\
243 - Alan lives with Walden.\\
244 - So, Alex...\\
245 - What do you do?\\
246 - I'm a cosmetic surgeon.\\
247 - Really? Beverly Hills, Botox, boobies?\\
248 - More like Mogadishu, cleft palates and burn victims.\\
249 - He travels around the world helping children in war zones.\\
250 - Oh.\\
251 - What are you guys, like, on a date?\\
252 - Walden, you knew eventually I'd start seeing other people.\\
253 - Nuh-uh.\\
254 - Whatever.\\
255 - Um, we should go.\\
256 - Nice to meet you.\\
257 - Really? What about this was nice?\\
258 - You didn't tell me he turned gay.\\
259 - He's gonna split that little guy in half.\\
260 - What a loser.\\
261 - That'll be $47.28.\\
262 - Oh, oh, damn.\\
263 - I-I left my wallet in the car.\\
264 - Uh, do you mind?\\
265 - Oh, yeah, sure.\\
266 - Oh, and throw in some Twizzlers.\\
267 - No, no, the big one.\\
268 -     Men.    \\
269 - I think you handled that very well,\\
270 - seeing Bridget with another guy.\\
271 - Another guy?\\
272 - She's dating Conan the Humanitarian.\\
273 - Yeah, she kinda is.\\
274 - It's like evolution, you know?\\
275 - He is to you as you are to me as I am to a howler monkey.\\
276 - That doesn't make me feel better.\\
277 - How do you think it makes me feel?\\
278 - You think she's sleeping with him?\\
279 - You kidding?\\
280 - I'm surprised they made it to the movies.\\
281 - Oh, God.\\
282 - Well, which raises a certain question.\\
283 - Um, your wife clearly attracts some extraordinary men.\\
284 - Of course she does.\\
285 - Look at her.\\
286 - I have.\\
287 - Which brings me to the question.\\
288 - Uh, does she have some sort of special powers?\\
289 - You know, sexually?\\
290 - What do you mean?\\
291 - All right, I'll just come straight out and say it.\\
292 - Does she have a magic vagina?\\
293 - Like, can you pull a rabbit out of it?\\
294 - Never mind.\\
295 -     Men.    \\
296 - In retrospect, maybe that wasn't the best movie\\
297 - to see under the circumstances.\\
298 - Are you kidding me? It was perfect.\\
299 - Boy meets girl, boy loses girl to a better guy,\\
300 - boy kills himself.\\
301 - Still, you got to love Sandra Bullock.\\
302 - - Here, take my keys. - Why?\\
303 - 'Cause I'm going to get dirty, stinking drunk.\\
304 - Appletini.\\
305 - Twice.\\
306 - Two beers.\\
307 - Whoa.\\
308 - Check it out.\\
309 - What?\\
310 - Who's that remind you of?\\
311 - Harry Potter?\\
312 - Bridget.\\
313 - Maybe a little. So?\\
314 - So it's a sign.\\
315 - Of what?\\
316 - I don't know.\\
317 - But I'm going to find out.\\
318 - Hi, I'm Walden.\\
319 - Danny.\\
320 - Danny?\\
321 - Short for Danielle.\\
322 - My father wanted a girl.\\
323 - It's nice to meet you, Danny.\\
324 - Let me save you some trouble.\\
325 - I'm here with somebody.\\
326 - Oh, yeah, of course.\\
327 - A beautiful girl like you.\\
328 - Bathroom's disgusting.\\
329 - I had to do the squat and hover.\\
330 - At least you're not peeing in a trough\\
331 - with looky-loos on either side.\\
332 - I'm Alan.\\
333 - Kiki.\\
334 - Oh, Kiki.\\
335 - Short for...\\
336 - K-Ki-Ki-Ki-Ki.\\
337 - Obviously, I'm gonna have to spell it out for you guys.\\
338 - Oh. Yeah, that certainly clears things up.\\
339 - What, you thought we were hitting on you?\\
340 - Maybe I have to spell it out for you.\\
341 - See?\\
342 - My apologies.\\
343 - I should've known by looking at... him.\\
344 - Uh, what was that about?\\
345 - Just work with me.\\
346 - Still want to buy our drinks?\\
347 - Uh, sure.\\
348 - Cheers.\\
349 - - Cheers. - Cheers.\\
350 - We're here, we're queer, get used to it.\\
351 -     Men.    \\
352 - Oh, man, check this out.\\
353 - Did you buy it together?\\
354 - Oh, I wish.\\
355 - Mr. Moneybags bought it.\\
356 - I just make it a home.\\
357 - Come on, Alan, let's go get our guests a cocktail.\\
358 - No offense.\\
359 - Oh, cocktail.\\
360 - All right, what's the plan?\\
361 - We gonna try and get them blind drunk\\
362 - and then flip them over to our team?\\
363 - What? No.\\
364 - Don't worry, I'll take Danny.\\
365 - You can have the hot one.\\
366 - Well, first of all, Danny is the hot one.\\
367 - And second of all, I'm not trying to flip anybody.\\
368 - So what was kissing me about?\\
369 - I like her.\\
370 - And I want her to feel comfortable\\
371 - being around us.\\
372 - So you used me.\\
373 - Oh, come on, Alan.\\
374 - She reminds me of Bridget.\\
375 - Just help me out here.\\
376 - Fine.\\
377 - Oh, and I'm sorry about kissing you.\\
378 - No, it's all right.\\
379 - If a man's gonna kiss me,\\
380 - I prefer he looks like the Son of God.\\
381 - Thank you.\\
382 - Now, are we gonna do this?\\
383 - I can't quit you.\\
384 -     Men.    \\
385 - So when did you realize you were gay?\\
386 - Oh, boy, that's a toughie.\\
387 - Uh... I guess my first hint\\
388 - was when I was, like, five or six years old.\\
389 - I used to make my G.I. Joe dolls\\
390 - touch each other inappropriately.\\
391 - I used the horn from my toy unicorn\\
392 - to make a strap-on for my Barbie.\\
393 - Mom was not happy.\\
394 - So when did you come out?\\
395 - It was later.\\
396 - Uh, I was actually married.\\
397 - Ooh, I bet that didn't end well.\\
398 - No.\\
399 - But I still love her.\\
400 - Even though, you know, I'm playing for Team Penis now.\\
401 - I am.\\
402 - So, girlfriend, scale of one to ten,\\
403 - exactly how gay are you?\\
404 - I don't understand.\\
405 - Well, you know, one being "love the one you're with""\\
406 - and ten being "touch me with that thing and I'll cut it off""\\
407 - Oh.\\
408 - I still don't understand.\\
409 - Are you exclusively with girls?\\
410 - Oh, no. I like guys, too, sometimes.\\
411 - Oh.\\
412 - What a coincidence.\\
413 - I happen to swing both ways as well.\\
414 - Really?\\
415 - You don't look like it.\\
416 - So how'd your wife react when you told her you were gay?\\
417 - She was very understanding.\\
418 - Very supportive.\\
419 - That's nice.\\
420 - Did I tell you we were\\
421 - high school sweethearts?\\
422 - Couple of times.\\
423 - She was the love of my life.\\
424 - What about Alan?\\
425 - Oh.\\
426 - Yeah, you know, I-I... love him.\\
427 - Ah, God, I can't do this anymore.\\
428 - I'm on Team Vagina.\\
429 - What?\\
430 - I miss my wife, and I wanted to hang out with you\\
431 - because you remind me of her.\\
432 - Really?\\
433 - I'm sorry I lied to you.\\
434 - It's okay.\\
435 - Come here, you poor baby.\\
436 - Don't even think about it, slick.\\
437 - Sorry. I'm sorry.\\
438 - So, if you're not gay, what's the deal with Alan?\\
439 - I'm not sure.\\
440 - He claims to be straight,\\
441 - but his lips opened a little when I kissed him.\\
442 - Look at me, I'm kissing a girl.\\
443 - You're kissing my girl!\\
444 - Oh!\\
445 - Oh, yeah, yuck.\\
446 - Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
447 - Whoa, whoa.\\
448 - All right, calm down.\\
449 - You can tell him he can stop acting gay.\\
450 - I'm not acting!\\
451 - You really hit me hard.\\
452 - I'm sorry. Let me see.\\
453 - Okay, that was uncalled for.\\
454 - How could you?! I'm sorry.\\
455 - Don't blame her. I mean, it was really...\\
456 - Come on.\\
457 - Bye, Walden.\\
458 - Bye, Danny. Bye, Kiki.\\
459 - You have a really lovely home.\\
460 - Are you okay?\\
461 - Well, I think she broke my nose,\\
462 - but I almost turned a lesbian, so...\\
463 - I'm gonna count it as a win.\\
464 - Attaboy.\\
465 -     Men.    \\
466 -     Men.    \\
467 - This was a nice idea.\\
468 - I'm just trying to cheer you up.\\
469 - After all, you did get your ass kicked by a girl.\\
470 - Well, jury's out that it was a "girl."\\
471 - Uh, Walden, I-I've got a confession to make.\\
472 - Listen, I know you didn't really forget your wallet.\\
473 - Oh.\\
474 - Okay, then I guess I have two confessions to make.\\
475 - Um, the other one is that I-I've been a very selfish man.\\
476 - How so?\\
477 - Well, when you told me you wanted to move to New York,\\
478 - the only thing I could think about\\
479 - was me losing a great place to live.\\
480 - I was totally oblivious to your feelings.\\
481 - Don't worry about it.\\
482 - No, no, no, I need to say this.\\
483 - You know, you're a great guy and you deserve to be happy.\\
484 - And if you have to move, I'd understand.\\
485 - But, uh, I want you to know\\
486 - I-I'd really, really miss you.\\
487 - I'd miss you, too.\\
488 - But I'm not going anywhere.\\
489 - Oh, you're not?\\
490 - Nah, the shrink's right.\\
491 - My problems are gonna follow me wherever I go.\\
492 - Besides... how could I leave my best friend?\\
493 - Aw...\\
494 - I'm the luckiest guy in the world.\\
495 - Told you.\\

\subsection {Episode 07: Those Fancy Japanese Toilets}
1 -     Men...    \\
2 - I can't believe you've managed to stay in this house.\\
3 - You're like a human barnacle.\\
4 - Thanks, Mom.\\
5 - Oh, I wasn't putting you down, sweetheart.\\
6 - It's good that you have a skill.\\
7 - Did you come over for a reason, or just to insult me?\\
8 - The two aren't mutually exclusive.\\
9 - Mom.\\
10 - Charlie's bank contacted me.\\
11 - Seems he had a secret safe deposit box.\\
12 - I knew it! I knew he had to have something squirreled away.\\
13 - Naturally, I went right down there to check it out.\\
14 - So what was in it? Cash? Diamonds? Krugerrands?\\
15 - Want to wipe your mouth? You're drooling a little.\\
16 - Sorry.\\
17 - Actually, I was quite surprised about what was in there.\\
18 - - Oh, tell me, tell me! - I'll do better than that.\\
19 - Here.\\
20 - I'm pretty sure he wanted you to have this.\\
21 - Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy...\\
22 - I knew you'd look out for me, big bro.\\
23 - What the hell is this?\\
24 - Charlie's journal.\\
25 - Charlie kept a journal?\\
26 - Your brother was a very complex man.\\
27 - Perhaps he needed a safe place\\
28 - to express his deepest emotions and innermost thoughts,\\
29 - or some such nonsense.\\
30 - No. No cash, dear. Already checked.\\
31 - Of course not.\\
32 - Why leave cash to your impoverished brother\\
33 - when you can leave your alcohol-muddled thoughts?\\
34 - Yay.\\
35 - "To whom it may concern,\\
36 - "if you are reading this it means either my heart or lungs\\
37 - "finally gave out.\\
38 - "Or I rejected my new liver.\\
39 - "Or my brother wouldn't give me a piece of his.\\
40 - "Or I choked on my own vomit,\\
41 - "or somebody else's.\\
42 - Or some crazy chick pushed me in front of a bus..."\\
43 - Ooh, so close.\\
44 - Well, I hope reading it brings you some comfort and closure.\\
45 - Are you sure that's all that was in the safe deposit box?\\
46 - Yes.\\
47 - So my brother went out to the bank\\
48 - and rented a safe deposit box just for this journal?\\
49 - It would appear so.\\
50 - That makes no sense.\\
51 - He intimated on many occasions\\
52 - that he had some cash stashed away for emergencies...\\
53 - you know, like getting a hooker after an earthquake.\\
54 - Sweetheart, you have to stop living in the past.\\
55 - What's done is done.\\
56 - Start looking forward.\\
57 - Yeah, I guess you're right.\\
58 - Is that a new watch?\\
59 - No.\\
60 - You have your whole life ahead of you,\\
61 - and the fact is, you and I are all that's left of this family.\\
62 - Well...\\
63 - you, me and Jake.\\
64 - Hey, Grandma.\\
65 - Whoa. Thought that was coming out the other end.\\
66 - You're right. It's just you and me.\\
67 - That looks like a man's Cartier.\\
68 - It's a knock-off.\\
69 - My point is, with Charlie gone,\\
70 - you and I have to learn how to help and support\\
71 - one another no matter what.\\
72 - Gee, that would be great.\\
73 - You were always the good son.\\
74 - Now you're my only son.\\
75 - Oh, Mommy.\\
76 - Oh, Walden! How nice to see you!\\
77 - It's a miracle I'm not a transsexual\\
78 - on Dancing With the Stars.\\
79 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
80 -     Men, men, men, manly men, men, men         Ooh    \\
81 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men         Ooh    \\
82 -     Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh...    \\
83 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
84 -     Ooh         Men, men, men,  manly men, men, men    \\

87 - == sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==\\
88 - I must tell you, Walden, it's so nice to finally\\
89 - see someone in this house\\
90 - who surfs for something other than porn.\\
91 - Yeah, I love the ocean.\\
92 - Just you alone with your thoughts.\\
93 - Time standing still, at peace with the entire universe.\\
94 - Plus, you can pee in it and nobody knows.\\
95 - Charming.\\
96 - Actually, I'm glad you stopped by.\\
97 - Um... Do you know a good interior designer?\\
98 - As a matter of fact, I know a great one.\\
99 - Evelyn Harper Interior Design.\\
100 - I thought you were a real estate agent.\\
101 - I am. I'm also a building inspector,\\
102 - mortgage broker, notary public and a bail bondsman.\\
103 - A bail bondsman?\\
104 - Admittedly, that business has slowed down since my son died.\\
105 - But getting back to your needs,\\
106 - what did you have in mind in terms of redecorating?\\
107 - I don't know.\\
108 - I just, I just want my home to reflect who I am.\\
109 - And who are you?\\
110 - I've got a buttload of money, but I'm a pretty simple guy.\\
111 - I... like people, but I don't entertain a lot.\\
112 - Oh, I'm not a neat freak, but I don't like clutter.\\
113 - Oh, you know, and the most important thing is,\\
114 - I want the house to use green renewable energy,\\
115 - you know, like solar power and wind power...\\
116 - Unless Brookstone or somebody comes out with\\
117 - a home nuclear reactor, because, I mean, come on,\\
118 - who wouldn't want one of those?\\
119 - "A buttload of money""\\
120 - You're in good hands.\\
121 - This journal is unbelievable.\\
122 - You aren't thinking of publishing it, are you?\\
123 - What? Of course not, why?\\
124 - Well, I'm shoppin' around my own Charlie memoir.\\
125 - It's called Man Whore.\\
126 - It's catchy.\\
127 - But there was more to Charlie than we thought.\\
128 - I mean, listen to this.\\
129 - "I just sent a girl home who told me she loved me\\
130 - "and I can't even remember her name.\\
131 - "What is wrong with me that I just have\\
132 - "anonymous drunken encounters night after night?\\
133 - "Do I drink to fill the loneliness,\\
134 - or to hide from the horror I've become?"\\
135 - You know, I feel awful that I lived with him for so long\\
136 - and I didn't recognize his pain.\\
137 - "I remember, her name is Rachel!\\
138 - "I feel better now.\\
139 - I'll reward myself with some cocaine and an Asian hooker."\\
140 - So remember, the key to balancing the equation\\
141 - is to place coefficients in front of each reactant\\
142 - and product so that all the atoms balance.\\
143 - I bet you shower every day.\\
144 - Jake, we're supposed to be studying\\
145 - for the chemistry mid-term.\\
146 - I'd rather study our chemistry.\\
147 - Lame.\\
148 - Really? I thought it was a "double intendo."\\
149 - Hey, guys.\\
150 - Whatcha studying?\\
151 - Chemistry.\\
152 - Cool.\\
153 - Looks like you two have a little chemistry.\\
154 - That's so clever.\\
155 - I'm Megan.\\
156 - Oh, hi, Megan. It's nice to meet you. I'm Walden.\\
157 - Oh, are you the Walden that bought the house?\\
158 - Yeah, how many Waldens have you met lately?\\
159 - That's... that's so funny.\\
160 - And I'm lame.\\
161 - Well, it was nice to meet you.\\
162 - I'll let you guys get back to your "chemistry."\\
163 - Bye, Walden! It was nice meeting you too.\\
164 - You know, if he hooks up with you, he goes to jail.\\
165 - I'd wait for him.\\
166 - "Peed blood again this morning.\\
167 - Should I be worried?"\\
168 - As it turns out, no.\\
169 - We have to get rid of Walden.\\
170 - - We do? - Oh yeah, he's gotta go.\\
171 - Does it occur to you that this is his house\\
172 - and if anybody goes, it's gonna be us?\\
173 - Actually, no.\\
174 - What's the problem?\\
175 - He's stealing my girlfriend.\\
176 - Wait, I thought she was your tutor.\\
177 - Think about it, Dad. Would I have asked for a tutor\\
178 - if I didn't have a... what do you call it, interior motive?\\
179 - Go on.\\
180 - She's only interested in glomming onto Walden.\\
181 - Well, if it makes you feel any better,\\
182 - I think my own mother likes him more than she likes me.\\
183 - Why would that make me feel better?\\
184 - I honestly don't know.\\
185 - Is this what I have to look forward to in life?\\
186 - Always losing girls to smarter, better-looking men?\\
187 - Well, think of it this way:\\
188 - you're carrying on a proud family tradition.\\
189 - Hello, dear.\\
190 - What's all this?\\
191 - Oh, didn't you know?\\
192 - I'm helping young Thor redecorate.\\
193 - I hope that's all you're doing.\\
194 - Whatever do you mean?\\
195 - He's tall, he's handsome, he's vulnerable,\\
196 - and you're old enough to be his ancestor.\\
197 - Relax, Alan. The only thing I want\\
198 - to pull out of that boy's pants is his wallet.\\
199 - You sure?\\
200 - Believe me, I have no ulterior motive.\\
201 - I believe that's "interior," Grandma.\\
202 - You really should get that boy a unicycle and some juggling pins.\\
203 - Evelyn, cool, you're here. Uh, could you come on up?\\
204 - There's some things I want you to do in my bedroom.\\
205 - Give the customer what he wants.\\
206 - Okay, to start with,\\
207 - I want grey Carrara marble counters,\\
208 - a steam shower...\\
209 - oh, and can we get one of those fancy Japanese toilets\\
210 - that sprays water and cleans your tushie?\\
211 - With your money you could afford\\
212 - an actual Japanese person to do it.\\
213 - See what you can find.\\
214 - Okay, in here, I would like to replace the bed frame,\\
215 - the curtains, the dresser,\\
216 - the end tables and the lamps.\\
217 - All right.\\
218 - What would you like to replace them with?\\
219 - Um...\\
220 - A cooler bed frame,\\
221 - cooler curtains, cooler dresser,\\
222 - cooler end tables and cooler lamps.\\
223 - "Cooler." I'm on it.\\
224 - Uh, now, would you like to repaint?\\
225 - Hey, can I have walls\\
226 - that change color depending on my mood?\\
227 - No.\\
228 - But we could paint them white\\
229 - and get you an industrial strength antidepressant.\\
230 - That will work too.\\
231 - Would you like to keep the camera?\\
232 - What camera?\\
233 - Aw...\\
234 - Awesome!\\
235 - I'm on TV.\\
236 - Hello!\\
237 - I am so keeping that.\\
238 - All right. Anything else?\\
239 - Can I have a Jacuzzi on the balcony?\\
240 - 'Cause I'm single now, so I'm going to be\\
241 - having sex with a lot of women I haven't met yet.\\
242 - Oh... I just got an idea!\\
243 - Just out of curiosity, what kind of woman are you attracted to?\\
244 - There's my wife.\\
245 - Oh, and there's women who look like my wife.\\
246 - That's very romantic.\\
247 - Oh, and Ellen DeGeneres.\\
248 - I don't know what it is.\\
249 - Whether it's the slacks or the way she dances--\\
250 - it's hot.\\
251 -     Men.    \\
252 -     Men.    \\
253 - You're up early.\\
254 - Charlie's journal-- I can't stop reading it.\\
255 - Listen to this.\\
256 - "My brother's kid showed up today.\\
257 - "He's kind of cute.\\
258 - "No way he's really Alan's kid.\\
259 - "And best of all, he's smart as a whip.\\
260 - I think he's got a very bright future."\\
261 - Oh, that just breaks my heart.\\
262 - Yeah.\\
263 - We were all so young and naive then.\\
264 - Hey.\\
265 - Hey.\\
266 - What? I took a huge dump.\\
267 - No way he's really my kid.\\
268 - You look very pretty today.\\
269 - Jake, I'm here to study.\\
270 - The test was yesterday.\\
271 - I already failed.\\
272 - Hey, guys.\\
273 - Hey, Walden.\\
274 - Here we go.\\
275 - Whoa, Megan, you look very pretty today.\\
276 - Thanks.\\
277 - You look pretty, too.\\
278 - Thank you.\\
279 - Where are you going?\\
280 - Oh, I am going furniture shopping with Jake's grandma.\\
281 - Oh, I love furniture.\\
282 - And grandmas.\\
283 - Cool.\\
284 - See ya.\\
285 - See ya.\\
286 - Okay, Megan,\\
287 - I know what's going on here\\
288 - and I really don't appreciate...\\
289 - What's that about?\\
290 - I don't know. I'm just in the mood.\\
291 - Okay.\\
292 - Come on.\\
293 - Okay.\\
294 - Where are we going?\\
295 - To your room.\\
296 - Okay.\\
297 - Hello, gorgeous.\\
298 - Did you miss me?\\
299 - 'Cause I sure missed you.\\
300 - Let me pull this thing out of you.\\
301 - Are you gonna turn your car off?\\
302 - I did.\\
303 - Might need service.\\
304 - Sadly, that's where I just came from.\\
305 - You know what's great about my electric car?\\
306 - What?\\
307 - I just turned it on.\\
308 - Sweet.\\
309 - So where you headed?\\
310 - Um, I'm going to pick up your mom.\\
311 - We're going furniture shopping.\\
312 - Okay, well, just a little heads up\\
313 - before you journey to the caves of Mordor.\\
314 - My mother has what you might call\\
315 - a, uh, proclivity for younger men.\\
316 - You mean she's like a cougar?\\
317 - No, she's not "like a cougar""\\
318 - she's the mother of all cougars.\\
319 - So kind of an uber-cougar?\\
320 - A super duper uber-cougar.\\
321 - You think a bit of better butter\\
322 - would make her bitter batter better?\\
323 - What?\\
324 - I just like saying that.\\
325 - Walden, I'm serious here.\\
326 - Don't worry.\\
327 - I'm not going to hook up with your mom.\\
328 - Yeah, if I had a dime for every time I heard that,\\
329 - I'd have $3.60.\\
330 - And I know that doesn't sound like a lot,\\
331 - but it is 36 times.\\
332 - That's a very weird thing to keep track of.\\
333 - I got a lot of free time.\\
334 - Trust me, nothing's going to happen.\\
335 - Okay. But try not to hurt her feelings.\\
336 - I mean, she may be a rapacious sexual predator,\\
337 - but she breaks just like a little girl.\\
338 - Understood.\\
339 - Oh, hey, check it out.\\
340 - I got voice control.\\
341 - Lights on.\\
342 - Radio on.\\
343 - Back up.\\
344 - Bye!\\
345 - Well, you may not be pretty or expensive,\\
346 - but you get me where I want to go.\\
347 - Thank you for walking me to my door.\\
348 - You don't meet many gentlemen nowadays.\\
349 - You're welcome.\\
350 - Is that a camera?\\
351 - Hello!\\
352 - Would you like to come in for a drink before you go?\\
353 - I don't know, I should probably get going.\\
354 - What's your hurry?\\
355 - I just think that\\
356 - we should keep our relationship business\\
357 - and not "biznass."\\
358 - Oh, my goodness, do you think I'm hitting on you?\\
359 - W-Well, Alan did say that you're an uber-cougar.\\
360 - An uber-cougar?\\
361 - A super duper uber-cougar.\\
362 - Oh, my Lord.\\
363 - Now, you listen to me, young man.\\
364 - My son has some serious issues.\\
365 - And he tends to imagine things.\\
366 - Believe me, I have no carnal designs on you whatsoever.\\
367 - Really?\\
368 - For God's sake, Walden, I'm old enough to be your mother.\\
369 - Assuming a teenage pregnancy of course.\\
370 - Okay, sure.\\
371 - I'll have a drink.\\
372 - Are you going to tell Alan?\\
373 - I'm going to tell everyone.\\
374 -     Men.    \\
375 -     Men.    \\
376 - "Alan moved in with his girlfriend yesterday.\\
377 - "How stupid is she?\\
378 - "Oh, well, doesn't matter.\\
379 - "Like a nonspecific urinary infection,\\
380 - "I'm sure he'll be back before long.\\
381 - "Truth be told, I actually kind of miss\\
382 - "the jug-eared freeloader.\\
383 - How stupid am I?"\\
384 - I don't believe it.\\
385 - He loved me.\\
386 - My brother loved me.\\
387 - "Speaking of stupid,\\
388 - "today I bought a $100,000 Cartier watch.\\
389 - "But I'm afraid to wear it,\\
390 - so I'm gonna keep it in my safe deposit box."\\
391 - Son of a bitch!\\
392 - That was, that was great.\\
393 - Just-Just great.\\
394 - Thank you so much.\\
395 - Hey.\\
396 - Hey. How'd it go with my mom?\\
397 - Fine, fine.\\
398 - Just shopped for furniture.\\
399 - Rugs, chairs and tables.\\
400 - Nice.\\
401 - Armoires, ottomans,\\
402 - curtains, recliners,\\
403 - love seats, throw pillows.\\
404 - Okay, good night.\\
405 - Oh, yeah, she did him.\\
406 - Bye. Thanks again!\\
407 - Hey, dude, how you doing?\\
408 - Fantastic.\\
409 - I love you, man.\\
410 - Thanks.\\
411 - What an affectionate family.\\

1 - Morning.\\
2 - Morning.\\
3 - Oh!\\
4 - We got Maple Loops.\\
5 -     It's got oats and corns and wheat    \\
6 -     It's the sweetest breakfast treat    \\
7 -     It's Maple, maple, maaaaple-icious!    \\
8 - Not a Maple Loops fan?\\
9 - Oh. Oh, no, I'm sorry.\\
10 - It's just, uh, threw me.\\
11 - My, uh, my brother wrote that jingle.\\
12 - Get out of here-- he wrote Maple Loops?\\
13 - Yeah, yeah, he wrote lots of jingles--\\
14 - Maple Loops, Granny's Big Fudge Nuggets.\\
15 - Granny's Big Fudge Nuggets?\\
16 -     From the magic chocolate mountain    \\
17 -     There's a secret chocolate mine    \\
18 -     With Granny's Big Fudge Nuggets and a taste    \\
19 -     That's oh so fine.    \\
20 - Wow, that's a good memory.\\
21 - What else, what else?\\
22 - Uh, well, there was Hammerstein Beer.\\
23 -     The girls look prettier with Hammerstein Beer    \\
24 -     You like what you see, you like what you hear    \\
25 -     Grab a cold frosty mug and pull her near    \\
26 -     'Cause the girls look prettier    \\
27 -     With Hammerstein Beer.    \\
28 - I had no idea your brother was a freaking genius.\\
29 - Well, he managed to live 44 years\\
30 - screwing everything that moved\\
31 - without catching a fatal venereal disease.\\
32 - I...\\
33 - I suppose there's a form of genius in that.\\
34 - You don't talk about him very much.\\
35 - Were you guys close?\\
36 - Oh, yeah, we were, we were inseparable.\\
37 - I mean, why do you think we lived together for so long?\\
38 - Well, Berta says it's 'cause you're a parasitic leech.\\
39 - Admittedly, that was one of his pet names for me,\\
40 - but not true.\\
41 - H-He loved me and I loved him.\\
42 - Oh, oh, you remember this one? Uh...\\
43 -     Bad stuff grows in the cracks of your toes    \\
44 -     But nobody knows    \\
45 - BOTH:     Like Toezene.    \\
46 - Yeah, he said I inspired that one.\\
47 - You miss him, don't you?\\
48 - Oh, of course I miss him.\\
49 - I don't miss the smell of vomit and lubricant in the morning...\\
50 - but I-I do miss him.\\
51 - Oh, what about this one?\\
52 -     I'm a pepper, he's a pepper    \\
53 -     She's a pepper, we're a pepper    \\
54 -     Wouldn't you like to be a pepper, too?    \\
55 - Uh, uh, no, Charlie didn't do that one.\\
56 - Oh, it's not that catchy anyway.\\
57 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
58 -     Ah.         Men.    \\

63 -     Oats and corn and wheat    \\
64 -     It's the sweetest breakfast treat    \\
65 -     It's...     WALDEN:     It's...    \\
66 -     Maple, maple, maaaaple-icious!    \\
67 - Oh, sorry.\\
68 - You were being sad, weren't you?\\
69 - A little.\\
70 - No, I-I can't tell you how many hours\\
71 - I watched my brother playing this piano\\
72 - or passed out under it.\\
73 - One time I walked in and he was having sex on top of it.\\
74 - You can see where the young lady's ass print\\
75 - didn't quite wax out.\\
76 - Maybe he should have used a coaster.\\
77 - (doorbell rings)\\
78 - (playing piano)\\
79 - New business idea-- ass coasters.\\
80 - We're here to pick up a piano.\\
81 - Oh, right, I, I forgot.\\
82 - Uh...\\
83 - Hold on.\\
84 - So I imagine you're anxious\\
85 - to get rid of some of these\\
86 - painful memories.\\
87 - No, are you kidding me?\\
88 - I mean, this piano is practically\\
89 - all I have left of my brother,\\
90 - except for, you know, all the DNA\\
91 - he left on the couch and...\\
92 - on the floor and...\\
93 - on the walls and on the stairs,\\
94 - but I'm not going to clone him, so the piano's pretty much it.\\
95 - Okay, we got a problem then. How so?\\
96 - Well, you know how I'm redecorating the house?\\
97 - I donated the piano to a music school for underprivileged kids.\\
98 - What?\\
99 - How could you be so selfish?\\
100 - I'm sorry, I'll just tell the kids\\
101 - they have to keep practicing on a painted slab of wood.\\
102 - No, no, you're right.\\
103 - This, this should go to someone\\
104 - who will benefit from it.\\
105 - You sure?\\
106 - Yeah, yeah, let me, uh, let me just get\\
107 - Charlie's personal stuff out of here.\\
108 - Oh, oh, here's some of his unfinished music.\\
109 - Uh, panties.\\
110 - Panties... panties.\\
111 - Water pipe.\\
112 - Oh, vibrator.\\
113 - (buzzes) Oh.\\
114 - (clatters)\\
115 - So we're talking songs,\\
116 - thongs, bongs, and schlongs.\\
117 - If he had an autobiography, that would be the title.\\
118 - You know, there was a time\\
119 - when I would have found these things disgusting.\\
120 - And now?\\
121 - There's a certain wistfulness\\
122 - mixed in with my revulsion.\\
123 - (knocking)\\
124 - Ready to go here?\\
125 - Uh, yeah, come on in.\\
126 - It's over here.\\
127 - Thanks, we would've had trouble finding it.\\
128 - I changed my mind!\\
129 - You can't have him!\\
130 - Okay, okay, Alan, Alan,\\
131 - what about the kids?\\
132 - Screw 'em!\\
133 - (sobbing)\\
134 - We're gonna need another minute.\\
135 - Oh, Charlie, why?\\
136 - Why, why, why, why, why?!\\
137 - Why?!\\
138 - White people.\\
139 -     Men.    \\
140 - Hello, Dad?\\
141 - Right here.\\
142 - Oh, hey.\\
143 - Something's different.\\
144 - Your uncle's piano is gone.\\
145 - Oh, yeah.\\
146 - Were we robbed?\\
147 - Yes, we're the latest victims of the piano thieves\\
148 - that have been plaguing the beach.\\
149 - Damn, they got my good bong.\\
150 - What?\\
151 - Oh, man, that is so wrong.\\
152 - No, it wasn't a robbery.\\
153 - Walden's redecorating.\\
154 - Cool.\\
155 - You know, for some reason,\\
156 - your uncle's death is really starting to hit me.\\
157 - I mean, I don't know if I was in de...\\
158 - What are you doing?\\
159 - Um, a toast to Uncle Charlie?\\
160 - Nice try.\\
161 - You're not the only one who misses him, you know.\\
162 - Really?\\
163 - You never talk about it.\\
164 - I need a beer to loosen up.\\
165 - Not gonna happen.\\
166 - Now, come on, talk to me.\\
167 - I don't know, Uncle Charlie just never treated me\\
168 - like I was some stupid kid.\\
169 - That's nice.\\
170 - He treated me more like a stupid person.\\
171 - Well, I know he loved you.\\
172 - Then how come he didn't leave me anything?\\
173 - Well, you don't measure love by things.\\
174 - I disagree.\\
175 - Nothing says "I love you" like a Mercedes CL600.\\
176 - Hey, the Mercedes was leased.\\
177 - And is that all your uncle meant to you-- a nice car?\\
178 - Of course not-- I learned a lot from him.\\
179 - Like what?\\
180 - Well, let's see.\\
181 - If it doesn't fit, don't force it.\\
182 - It's always better to say sorry afterwards\\
183 - than ask for permission before.\\
184 - And if it's burning, bleeding, or oozing,\\
185 - go to see a doctor ASAP.\\
186 - (sighs) Oh, God.\\
187 - But probably the most important thing I learned\\
188 - is that by the time I'm his age,\\
189 - I want to be married and have a family.\\
190 - Really?\\
191 - Yeah, Uncle Charlie was very lonely, Dad.\\
192 - Yeah, yeah, he was.\\
193 - And I don't want to be like him.\\
194 - Well, good for you.\\
195 - Of course, I don't want to be like you either.\\
196 - Even better.\\
197 - By the way, do you have a number for this Dr. Asap?\\
198 - He's not listed anywhere.\\
199 - What?\\
200 - I mean, I don't need him right now,\\
201 - but I want to have him on speed dial, so if I do,\\
202 - I can get him as soon as possible.\\
203 - ASAP?\\
204 - Yeah, him.\\
205 - A-S-A-P?\\
206 - I know how to spell it, Dad, I'm not an idiot.\\
207 -     Men.    \\
208 - Can I get you another appletini, Alan?\\
209 - Yes.\\
210 - Uh, no, uh,\\
211 - make it a bourbon.\\
212 - Since when do you drink bourbon?\\
213 - It's what my brother drank.\\
214 - Yeah, but your brother knew how to drink.\\
215 - Hey, I watched him for years.\\
216 - You don't think I picked up a few things?\\
217 - Maybe.\\
218 - It certainly wasn't women or checks.\\
219 - Ah, there you are.\\
220 - Oh, how'd you find me?\\
221 - Well, you're depressed,\\
222 - and when you're depressed, you drink,\\
223 - and when you drink, you come here.\\
224 - If you were a fat guy, I would have gone\\
225 - to where they serve pies.\\
226 - Hi there.\\
227 - What can I get you?\\
228 - I will have a ginger ale, please.\\
229 - One ginger ale, coming right up.\\
230 - Uh, I-I'm still waiting on that bourbon.\\
231 - I've only got two hands.\\
232 - Here you go.\\
233 - Can I get you anything else--\\
234 - slice of lime, peanuts, breakfast in bed?\\
235 - Thank you, I'm good.\\
236 - Oh, I'm betting you are.\\
237 - (Alan clears throat)\\
238 - Don't be clearing your throat at me.\\
239 - Here.\\
240 - Thank you.\\
241 - She's nice.\\
242 - To you, sure.\\
243 - You live in a world of nice.\\
244 - That's because I'm nice to people,\\
245 - and they're nice back to me.\\
246 - No, it's because you're tall, rich, and good-looking.\\
247 - And nice.\\
248 - Oh, please, that had nothing to do with it.\\
249 - I mean, take my brother.\\
250 - He wasn't nice, but he had money and looks,\\
251 - so he always got a free pass.\\
252 - Men wanted to be him, and women wanted to be with him.\\
253 - Actually, a few of the men wanted to be with him, too.\\
254 - A couple of 'em actually succeeded,\\
255 - but that's a story for another day.\\
256 - Well, cheers.\\
257 - Hi.\\
258 - Hi.\\
259 - Who's your friend?\\
260 - He's a bloodthirsty psychopath\\
261 - with a panel van and a rag soaked in chloroform.\\
262 - Hi, I'm Alicia.\\
263 - I'm Walden.\\
264 -     Men.    \\
265 - And then, after he kills the women,\\
266 - he peels off their faces\\
267 - and uses them to make hand puppets.\\
268 - Good night, Alan. Good night, Alan.\\
269 - Okay, see you in the Dumpster.\\
270 - (giggles)\\
271 - Man.\\
272 - I couldn't score a woman like that if my semen cured cancer.\\
273 - Aw, Charlie.\\
274 - I'll bet you're up there watching\\
275 - and laughing your ass off.\\
276 - You left a big hole down here, buddy.\\
277 - And a lot of little ones.\\
278 - I-I never told you this while you were still alive, but...\\
279 - I would've given anything to be like you.\\
280 - Even for a day.\\
281 - (dog barks)\\
282 - Hey there, big guy.\\
283 - Where'd you come from?\\
284 - WOMAN: Douglas!\\
285 - Douglas, where are you, boy?\\
286 - Up here.\\
287 - Oh... pretty mommy.\\
288 - (sighs) There you are, Douglas.\\
289 - I'm so sorry. I hope he didn't bother you.\\
290 - Oh, not at all. This is my favorite kind of dog.\\
291 - Oh, you like labs?\\
292 - No, I like dogs\\
293 - that fetch me beautiful women.\\
294 - Cute.\\
295 - Is this your house?\\
296 - Uh, not exactly.\\
297 - What do you mean?\\
298 - I mean, after we fall in love\\
299 - and get married, it'll be ours.\\
300 - Wow, you don't waste any time, do you?\\
301 - Nope. When I see what I want, I get right to the B.S.\\
302 - I'm Melanie.\\
303 - Melanie Laughlin.\\
304 - Oh. Nice to meet you, Melanie.\\
305 - I'm...\\
306 - Charlie.\\
307 - Charlie Harper.\\
308 -     Men.    \\
309 -     Men.    \\
310 - That was fun.\\
311 - Yeah, it was.\\
312 - You know, I was a little worried I wasn't gonna be able\\
313 - to get used to single life,\\
314 - but this "casual sex with no commitment" stuff\\
315 - is kind of growing on me.\\
316 - Wait, what?\\
317 - Thank you for the intercourse.\\
318 - Bye-bye.\\
319 - (sighs)\\
320 - Well, Mr. Penis is happy.\\
321 - Time to take care of Mr. Stomach.\\
322 - Good morning.\\
323 - Morning.\\
324 - You are an incredible lover, Charlie Harper.\\
325 - I believe if a gal's worth doing, she's worth doing well.\\
326 - (laughs)\\
327 - You're terrible.\\
328 - Yes. I am.\\
329 - Hey.\\
330 - Can your dog hold a video camera?\\
331 -     Men.    \\
332 - Berta, how do you feel about casual sex?\\
333 - I'm all for it.\\
334 - Just let me finish the dishes\\
335 - and run a comb through my hair.\\
336 - Morning.\\
337 - Morning.\\
338 - Morning.\\
339 - What are you doing?\\
340 - Hair of the dog.\\
341 - Oh.\\
342 - Oh, that one's not dog.\\
343 - Bye! Call me!\\
344 - Oh.\\
345 - I will!\\
346 - As soon as I remember your name.\\
347 - Who was that?\\
348 - Oh, I just tapped\\
349 - a little strange last night.\\
350 - (dog barks)\\
351 - Which one did you tap?\\
352 - I'll give you a hint.\\
353 - I didn't do the dog people style.\\
354 - It's walking like Zippy, but it sure ain't talking like Zippy.\\
355 - Yeah. I don't know him as well as you do.\\
356 - Is he prone to having mental breakdowns?\\
357 - Prone, no.\\
358 - Eligible, certainly.\\
359 -     Men.    \\
360 - Whoa, look who's getting busy.\\
361 - Hey.\\
362 - Mr. Harper, we were just making out.\\
363 - Yeah, we all know what happens after making out.\\
364 - Making in and out.\\
365 - (clears throat)\\
366 - Listen up, grasshoppers.\\
367 - You know how they say that marijuana leads to harder drugs?\\
368 - Well, the same thing applies to the human tongue.\\
369 - It leads to harder organs.\\
370 - Now, if you are not careful, you're gonna wake up one morning\\
371 - with a big-headed bun in the oven.\\
372 - No offense, Charlie Brown.\\
373 - I'm begging you, please leave.\\
374 - Relax, I'm just looking out for you.\\
375 - Here, tell you what.\\
376 - Take the young lady out for a nice dinner, on me.\\
377 - It's a dollar.\\
378 - You're welcome!\\
379 -     Men.    \\
380 - I think we have a problem.\\
381 - Your father?\\
382 - Yeah.\\
383 - He's acting like my Uncle Charlie.\\
384 - I mean, he's even dressing like my Uncle Charlie.\\
385 - The only thing left of my dad is his cheapness.\\
386 - Well, Jake, he suffered a big loss.\\
387 - People deal with that in different ways.\\
388 - I mean, I still haven't processed the grief\\
389 - over my marriage ending.\\
390 - I'm... sure someday it'll hit me\\
391 - that the most important person in my life is gone.\\
392 - My soul mate.\\
393 - My best friend.\\
394 - My lover.\\
395 - In the meantime, you just carry on.\\
396 - And you to try to fill that void by having casual drunk sex\\
397 - with strange, hot women that don't mind\\
398 - if you dance around in their panties.\\
399 - Is everybody turning into Uncle Charlie?\\
400 -     Men.    \\
401 - Ah, Cuban in one hand,\\
402 - scotch in the other.\\
403 - All I need is a French chick in my lap\\
404 - and I'm the United-freakin'-Nations.\\
405 - (knocking)\\
406 - Got a minute?\\
407 - Uh, pretty busy, but okay.\\
408 - Thanks.\\
409 - All right, look...\\
410 - People are really worried about you.\\
411 - Hey, the only reason people are worried about me is 'cause\\
412 - they can't wrap their heads around how cool I am.\\
413 - Yeah, no, I don't think that's it.\\
414 - Look, I know you miss your brother.\\
415 - (scoffs)\\
416 - Miss my brother?\\
417 - That parasitic leech.\\
418 - Not likely.\\
419 - Hey, you remember that shrink that you sent me to?\\
420 - Maybe you should go see her.\\
421 - What for? I'm fine.\\
422 - What's your name?\\
423 - Charlie Harper.\\
424 - You're not fine.\\
425 - Well, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.\\
426 - Okay.\\
427 - I'll tell you what, why don't you get some rest,\\
428 - maybe lick your finger, stick it in a light socket,\\
429 - and we'll revisit this in the morning.\\
430 - You got it, big fella.\\
431 - Who the hell was that?\\
432 -     Men.    \\
433 -     It's got oats and corn and wheat    \\
434 -     It's the sweetest breakfast treat    \\
435 -     It's...    \\
436 -     Maple, maple, maaaaple-icious!    \\
437 - Uh, what are you doing in here?\\
438 - What are you doing in here?\\
439 - It's my shower!\\
440 - Once again, agree to disagree.\\
441 - Okay, listen...\\
442 - Whoa! Nice penis!\\
443 - You could paint a face on that thing\\
444 - and ride in the car pool lane.\\
445 - Thank you.\\
446 - Uh-oh, what's going on down there?\\
447 - Call the cops; I've been robbed!\\
448 -     Men.    \\
449 - ALAN: Great idea.\\
450 - You and me, Vegas.\\
451 - (chuckles)\\
452 - Yep.\\
453 - I am gonna show you a good time.\\
454 - They love me in Vegas.\\
455 - I'm sure they do.\\
456 - Trust me, the name Charlie Harper opens a lot of doors.\\
457 - And a lot of legs.\\
458 - No kidding.\\
459 - But be sure to wear a condom.\\
460 - Not everything stays in Vegas.\\
461 - Okay.\\
462 - Well, here we are.\\
463 - Really? This doesn't look like the Bellagio.\\
464 - It's the, uh, back entrance.\\
465 - Ah, not the only back entrance we'll be using this weekend.\\
466 - Am I right? Up top.\\
467 - (laughs)\\
468 - Hello, Mr. Harper.\\
469 - If you could just come with us.\\
470 - Uh, don't forget my bags.\\
471 - We'll be going to the presidential suite.\\
472 - Oh, yes, sir.\\
473 - Slip 'em both a sawbuck.\\
474 - I'll see you in the room.\\
475 - Will do.\\
476 - (tires screeching)\\
477 - This way, Mr. Harper.\\
478 - So who's playing the big room?\\
479 - Celine? Elton?\\
480 - I'm gonna want tickets-- comped.\\
481 -     Men.    \\
482 -     Men.    \\
483 - Hello, concierge? Yes.\\
484 - Um, this is Charlie Harper in the presidential suite.\\
485 - Uh, I'm gonna need a bucket of ice,\\
486 - a bottle of scotch and two Asian hookers.\\
487 - You know what, they're small.\\
488 - Make it three.\\
489 - Yes, thanks.\\

11 - Hey.\\
12 - He's acting like my Uncle Charlie.\\
13 - He's even dressing like my Uncle Charlie.\\
14 - People are really worried about you.\\
15 - The only reason people are worried about me\\
16 - is 'cause they can't wrap their heads around how cool I am.\\
17 - - I'm fine. - What's your name?\\
18 - - Charlie Harper. - You're not fine.\\
19 - I've got a great idea.\\

34 - Now that you're leaving us,\\
35 - you can have your belt and shoelaces back.\\
36 - Oh. Thank you.\\
37 - But believe me, there was never any possibility\\
38 - I was going to hurt myself.\\
39 - Yeah, well, it only takes one whack job\\
40 - hanging from the shower curtain to ruin it for everybody.\\
41 - I... I suppose.\\
42 - And I guess I did lose it for a little while there.\\
43 - Lose it?\\
44 - We had a pool on how long it would take\\
45 - to get you toilet trained again.\\
46 - Really?\\
47 - Cost me 50 bucks.\\
48 - And a pair of nice white shoes.\\
49 - Sorry.\\
50 - I tend to leak under pressure.\\
51 - So you think you're ready\\
52 - to go back out into the world?\\
53 - Yeah. Yeah, I do.\\
54 - I mean, I've, uh, learned a lot about myself\\
55 - in the last month, and I... I now have the tools\\
56 - to deal with life on life's terms.\\
57 - You know, a lot of people say that,\\
58 - but you'd be surprised how another couple of weeks\\
59 - of treatment can make all the difference in the world.\\
60 - You have another pool, don't you?\\
61 - Nothing personal.\\
62 - Just trying to get even.\\
63 - Sorry I couldn't be more help.\\
64 - That's okay.\\
65 - Got $100 says you'll be back before Christmas.\\
66 - Thanks for your support.\\

78 - Thanks for picking me up.\\
79 - No problem.\\
80 - So you're not crazy anymore?\\
81 - I was never actually crazy.\\
82 - Then why were you in the nuthouse?\\
83 - It's not a nuthouse; it's a stress clinic.\\
84 - What's the difference?\\
85 - About $2,500 a week.\\
86 - But the good news is that I got a lot out of it.\\
87 - I mean, I am ready to deal\\
88 - with whatever life throws at me, you know.\\
89 - Full speed ahead.\\
90 - Well, that's good, 'cause I've got something\\
91 - I want to talk to you about.\\
92 - Oh, anything. Dad's here for you, pal.\\
93 - Cool.\\
94 - So remember Megan?\\
95 - Oh, yeah, that was, uh, your little girlfriend.\\
96 - Uh, she's seems like a great gal.\\
97 - Well, I'm glad you like her\\
98 - 'cause she's kind of pregnant.\\
99 - Kind of?\\
100 - She's not showing yet.\\
101 - She's still in her first semester.\\
102 - Oh, my God.\\
103 - How-how... how did this happen?\\
104 - I mean, what about our talks about, uh,\\
105 - sexual responsibility and-and using protection?\\
106 - I can explain that.\\
107 - Go ahead.\\
108 - I was drunk.\\
109 - Okay. Okay.\\
110 - I have the tools.\\
111 - And how do you propose to take care of this child?\\
112 - Oh, we got that figured out.\\
113 - First, we're going to quit school and get jobs.\\
114 - Okay, stop right there.\\
115 - What jobs?\\
116 - Advertising-- we're going to teach the baby to talk\\
117 - and put him in E-Trade commercials.\\
118 - You're joking.\\
119 - No. We figure the baby they got is probably getting pretty old.\\
120 - What does your mother think about this?\\
121 - - She doesn't know. - What?\\
122 - I was hoping you'd tell her.\\
123 - Why do I have to tell her?\\
124 - Because she already hates you\\
125 - and she scares the crap out of me.\\
126 - Hey, there he is.\\
127 - Welcome home, buddy.\\
128 - Thank you. I'm glad to be here.\\
129 - Yeah. How you feeling?\\
130 - Fine. Why are you whispering?\\
131 - Oh, I don't want to startle you.\\
132 - Walden, I'm okay.\\
133 - Yeah, sure you are.\\
134 - Hey, Walden, guess what.\\
135 - I'm going to be a dad.\\
136 - Really?\\
137 - Wow.\\
138 - How you feel about that, Grandpa?\\
139 - Well, it's, uh, not something I would have chosen\\
140 - for him at this stage of his life,\\
141 - but he will continue to have my love and support.\\
142 - If it's a boy, we're going to name him Frodo.\\
143 - You're not making it easy for me, pal.\\
144 - You should have used a condom.\\
145 - Or you should have.\\
146 - Hey, look who's back from the loony bin.\\
147 - It wasn't a loony bin; it's a stress clinic.\\
148 - Did they let you keep your belt?\\
149 - Uh, well... Loony bin.\\
150 - - There's your mail. - Thank you.\\
151 - Hey, Berta, I'm going to be a dad.\\
152 - What's funny?\\
153 - From where you're standing, nothing.\\
154 - Did you tell him your news?\\
155 - Mmm, it'll keep.\\
156 - Hey, open your mail.\\
157 - Okay. Let's see.\\
158 - Uh, bill, bill, jury duty,\\
159 - bill.\\
160 - Ooh! Oh, here we go.\\
161 - My refund from the IRS.\\
162 - Ooh. Whew!\\
163 - Just in time what with all these bills.\\
164 - Might want to set some of that aside for Frodo's headshots.\\
165 - Huh.\\
166 - It's not a refund at all.\\
167 - I'm being audited.\\
168 - What's so funny?\\
169 - From where you're standing, nothing.\\
170 - I guess you're probably wondering\\
171 - why I asked you guys to come over.\\
172 - We understand, Alan.\\
173 - Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of.\\
174 - I'm not mentally ill.\\
175 - It was a stress clinic.\\
176 - Did the door lock from the inside or the outside?\\
177 - Uh, uh, well, the... the...\\
178 - Nevertheless, the reason I called a family meeting\\
179 - is because, uh, Jake\\
180 - and Megan have some news.\\
181 - Oh, my God. She's pregnant.\\
182 - Well, that was easy.\\
183 - Who wants cake?\\
184 - How could you do this?\\
185 - She made me.\\
186 - What?\\
187 - Oh, come on.\\
188 - Between the two of us, who was a virgin?\\
189 - Okay, okay.\\
190 - What's done is done,\\
191 - but if we can come together as a family,\\
192 - we can deal with this without finger-pointing.\\
193 - Your father's right.\\
194 - Let's just calm down and talk it through.\\
195 - Is it just me, or does Herb and Judith's kid\\
196 - look a lot like Alan?\\
197 - Well, you know, there is a slight resemblance.\\
198 - - Damn it, Jake! - What the hell is wrong with you?\\
199 - How could you be so irresponsible?\\
200 - I mean, what were you thinking? What were you thinking?\\
201 - Did we raise you not to know any better than this?\\
202 - What do you have to say for yourself?\\
203 - When are you going to tell him your news?\\
204 - Ah, I don't want to make things worse.\\
205 - See, that's the big difference between you and me.\\
206 - And you're a grandpa now.\\
207 - Grandpa. Grandpa.\\
208 - A grandpa and grandma...\\
209 - Hey.\\
210 - Hey. How'd your audit go?\\
211 - It wasn't so much an audit\\
212 - as a brutal prison rape with a number two pencil.\\
213 - I'm confused.\\
214 - Did you like it or not?\\
215 - They say I owe them $80,000.\\
216 - So not.\\
217 - But the good news is, if they take\\
218 - everything I own, they'll only get four.\\
219 - $4,000?\\
220 - Four dollars.\\
221 - But I'm not worried.\\
222 - Because I have the tools to cope with whatever life throws at me.\\
223 - No, you don't.\\
224 - Alan?\\
225 - Oh, Lyndsey.\\
226 - Sweetheart, are you a sight for sore eyes.\\
227 - Yeah, it's good to see you, too.\\
228 - Oh.\\
229 - Alan, you're home.\\
230 - Hey, Walden, I think now's the time to tell him.\\
231 - Tell me what?\\
232 - Aw.\\
233 - What's so funny?\\
234 - From where I'm standing, everything.\\
235 -     Men.    \\
236 -     Men.    \\
237 - I'm sorry you had to find out this way.\\
238 - Oh. Really? Really?\\
239 - How would you have liked me to hear about it?\\
240 - Twitter? Facebook? A singing telegram?\\
241 -     Ta-ra-ra boom-dee-ay, I banged your girl today    \\
242 -     'Cause I'm a billionaire, I still have all my hair.    \\
243 - I-I understand that you're upset,\\
244 - but you have to see this from our viewpoint.\\
245 - What's your viewpoint?\\
246 - The sex is awesome.\\
247 - It really is.\\
248 - He's the best I've ever had.\\
249 - No, you're the best I've ever had.\\
250 - You're the best I've had.\\
251 - - No, you. - No, you.\\
252 - Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!\\
253 - How did this happen?\\
254 - It was actually kind of a meet cute.\\
255 - Uh, Lyndsey came here to see where you were,\\
256 - and I told her where you were,\\
257 - and then she started to cry, and...\\
258 - bippity-boppity-boo, we're having sex.\\
259 - Bippity-boppity-boo?\\
260 - How do you go from crying to sex?\\
261 - With him, it was always the other way around.\\
262 - Okay, okay, and-and-and what was the cute part?\\
263 - Look at him.\\
264 - No, look at you.\\
265 - - No, you. - No, you.\\
266 - Hey! Hey! I'm still here!\\
267 - I mean, how-how could you do this?\\
268 - How-how could you have an affair\\
269 - while I'm locked up in the booby hatch?\\
270 - I thought it was a stress clinic.\\
271 - Everybody knows what it was!\\
272 - I lost my freaking mind!\\
273 - But luckily, now I'm better, so I have the tools\\
274 - to cope with whatever life throws at me!\\
275 - That's great, Alan, 'cause there's one more thing.\\
276 - Oh, super. Let me have it.\\
277 - - You need to move out. - What?!\\
278 - Come on, it'd be creepy if you're\\
279 - downstairs listening while we're having sex.\\
280 - Lyndsey doesn't make any noise.\\
281 - I do now.\\
282 - Fine. Fine. Let me just get my things.\\
283 - Uh, not necessary.\\
284 - We packed your stuff.\\
285 - Oh, yeah. It's all in a storage bin out by the airport.\\
286 - But don't worry, I took care of the first month's rent.\\
287 - Here's the key.\\
288 - Why, thank you.\\
289 - You know, I hope someday, we can look back\\
290 - at this as friends and just laugh.\\
291 - Someday?\\
292 - Why wait? Let's laugh now.\\
293 - Okay, I'll go.\\
294 - That's it!\\
295 - I am done being a doormat.\\
296 - I'll show 'em.\\
297 - I will show 'em all.\\
298 - They won't have Alan Harper to kick around anymore.\\
299 - And they will be sorry.\\
300 - Apologies will be made,\\
301 - tears will be wept,\\
302 - but it's all gonna be too late\\
303 - 'cause I am out of here!\\
304 - Sleeping the big sleep, the ol' dirt nap.\\
305 - Adios, muchachos, it's the last roundup.\\
306 - God, check, please.\\
307 - Perfect.\\
308 -     Men.    \\
309 - Hi! Hi, Mom, it's me!\\
310 - I need a place to stay.\\
311 - Walden kicked me out and my car blew up\\
312 - and I had to hitchhike over here!\\
313 - So, solly,\\
314 - Missy Everyn no home.\\
315 - Missy Everyn?!\\
316 - Come on, Mom!\\
317 - What are you doing?\\
318 - Let me in! I'm soaking wet,\\
319 - and I had to give a truck driver a happy ending just to get here!\\
320 - Go away! I call po-rice!\\
321 - What kind of accent is that supposed to be?!\\
322 - Herro? Po-rice?\\
323 - Clazy man outside.\\
324 - You come quick!\\
325 - Fine, fine! I'm leaving!\\
326 - Thanks a lot!\\
327 - Rots of ruck!\\
328 - Unbelievable.\\
329 - Blindsided by my son...\\
330 - reamed by the IRS...\\
331 - rejected by my lover...\\
332 - betrayed by my friend...\\
333 - molested by a truck driver...\\
334 - cast out by my mother...\\
335 - and rained on by God.\\
336 - And this isn't even the worst week of my life.\\
337 - Oh, come on.\\
338 - Might as well make myself comfortable.\\
339 - Nowhere to go from here.\\
340 - End of the line.\\
341 - Rock bottom.\\
342 - Can a man sink any lower?\\
343 - Asked and answered.\\
344 - Pardon me.\\
345 - Do you happen to have a flashlight?\\
346 - Uh, what?\\
347 - The light in my storage unit isn't working.\\
348 - I need a flashlight.\\
349 - Oh. Uh, yeah, sure. Um...\\
350 - Yeah, uh... what the hell?\\
351 - Oh, here you go.\\
352 - Thank you.\\
353 - My fur coats all feel alike in the dark.\\
354 - Lot of things feel alike in the dark.\\
355 - Ooh, you rascal!\\
356 - Uh, I'm Alan Harper.\\
357 - Veronica Hastings.\\
358 - Come here often?\\
359 - No, but the night is young.\\
360 - Ooh. Innuendo?\\
361 - Not usually.\\
362 - But if you play your cards right...\\
363 - Listen, Alan Harper,\\
364 - I keep some nice wines in my storage unit.\\
365 - Can I interest you in a glass?\\
366 - I would like that very much.\\
367 - Don't go away.\\
368 - There is no chance of that happening.\\
369 - You had a plan all along, didn't you, God?\\
370 - Alan?\\
371 - Yes, Lord?\\
372 - Over here.\\
373 - Oh! Oh, Herb.\\
374 - What are you doing here?\\
375 - I called Walden.\\
376 - He told me this is where I might find you.\\
377 - Oh, well, I, uh, I appreciate you stopping by,\\
378 - but I'm not really set up for entertaining yet.\\
379 - I didn't just stop by.\\
380 - I have some news for you.\\
381 - Really? Good news?\\
382 - I had a DNA test done on my daughter Millie.\\
383 - Oh?\\
384 - Turns out she's your daughter.\\
385 - Bad news.\\
386 - And it's about to get worse.\\
387 - Oh, come on!\\
388 - Good-bye, Alan.\\
389 - Oh, no, Herb, please, please!\\
390 - I'm about get laid by Jessica Rabbit!\\
391 - No, Herb, no!\\
392 - Oh, thank God I'm still in the loony bin.\\
393 - It's a stress clinic.\\
394 -     Men.    \\
395 - Thanks for picking me up.\\
396 - No problem.\\
397 - I'm surprised Walden let you take his car.\\
398 - I know, right?\\
399 - With my driving record?\\
400 - I'm really glad you're feeling better.\\
401 - You had me worried.\\
402 - I'm sorry. Didn't mean to.\\
403 - But everything's fine now.\\
404 - Good.\\
405 - Hey, is it too soon to talk to you\\
406 - about something important?\\
407 - You can talk to me about anything.\\
408 - I have the tools to cope.\\
409 - Cool. Remember Megan?\\
410 - Oh, God...\\
411 - Well, we've been going out for a while now\\
412 - and all of a sudden, she's saying\\
413 - she wants to see other people,\\
414 - but I want to keep it, you know, monotonous.\\
415 - That, that's it? She's not pregnant?\\
416 - No, of course not.\\
417 - I've been stuck at third base for months.\\
418 - That's a relief.\\
419 - For you, maybe.\\
420 - Anyway, I was just wondering if you had\\
421 - some advice on how to keep a woman from leaving you.\\
422 - So how was the food in there?\\
423 -     Men.    \\
424 - It feels strange to be back here.\\
425 - Just to warn you, things are\\
426 - a little bit different than you remember them.\\
427 - What do you mean?\\
428 - I promised Walden\\
429 - I wouldn't tell you.\\
430 - - Bye. - Where you going?\\
431 - I'm gonna take Walden's car over to Megan's,\\
432 - see if it helps me slide into home.\\
433 - Wear protection!\\
434 - I'm wearing it now!\\
435 - Whoa.\\
436 - Hey, buddy.\\
437 - How ya doing?\\
438 - I'm okay.\\
439 - Good, good, I'm glad.\\
440 - Walden, you don't have\\
441 - to talk to me like a crazy person.\\
442 - Oh, crazy people don't talk like this.\\
443 - Regular people talk like this when\\
444 - they're talking to crazy people.\\
445 - Fine. Whatever.\\
446 - I see you finished redecorating.\\
447 - Yeah. What do you think?\\
448 - Ah, it looks fantastic.\\
449 - Oh, hey, check this out.\\
450 - Computer, lights off.\\
451 - Computer, music on.\\
452 -        \\
453 - That's awesome.\\
454 - Yeah, it's the home of tomorrow.\\
455 - Except it's today.\\
456 - Computer, music off.\\
457 - Okay, let me try.\\
458 - Uh, computer, lights on.\\
459 - Oh, no, that won't work.\\
460 - It's keyed to my voice.\\
461 - Oh, well, then how do I turn the lights on and off?\\
462 - You can't.\\
463 - Hey, let me show you the kitchen.\\
464 - Boy, sure hope I can flush the toilet.\\
465 -     Ta-da!    \\
466 - Ta-da, indeed.\\
467 - Oh, hey, check this out.\\
468 - I connected the refrigerator to the Internet.\\
469 - Ice.\\
470 - Wait for it.\\
471 - Is that cool or what?\\
472 - And if I want ice?\\
473 - You just call me and then I'll call the refrigerator.\\
474 - Oh, oh, check this out.\\
475 - Computer, television on.\\
476 - - Wow! - Yeah.\\
477 - What is it about a giant TV?\\
478 - Right? I mean, just looking at it gives me a chubby.\\
479 - Welcome home, buddy.\\
480 - Oh, thanks, Walden, but you and I both know\\
481 - this is not my home.\\
482 - Oh, sure, it is.\\
483 - No, let me finish.\\
484 - I had a lot of time to think while I was away.\\
485 - At least after I came off the thorazine.\\
486 - And I realized that it's one thing to live off my brother,\\
487 - but he's gone and...\\
488 - now his stuff's gone, too.\\
489 - I really don't belong here anymore.\\
490 - So you're moving out?\\
491 - Oh, no, no! God, no!\\
492 - I mean, look at the size of this thing.\\
493 - No, I just want you to know that\\
494 - I'm aware of the absurdity of our situation.\\
495 - Bring it in. Oh...\\
496 - Computer, music on.\\
497 -     And I will always love you...    \\
498 - And let me know if you need ice.\\

1 -     Men.    \\
2 - Can I ask you a personal question?\\
3 - No, Jake, I've never measured my penis.\\
4 - No, it's not about that.\\
5 - I heard my dad say you're worth like a billion dollars.\\
6 - You know, I'm not really comfortable\\
7 - talking about my financial situation.\\
8 - Oh, okay.\\
9 - Let's just say I'd have more money than God,\\
10 - if God only had 900 million.\\
11 - Wow! You don't have any kids, do you?\\
12 - - Nope. - Here, let me push the cart.\\
13 - Thanks. So if you have so much money,\\
14 - why do you do your own grocery shopping?\\
15 - I mean, you could just write a list\\
16 - and hire someone to do it for you.\\
17 - You know, like a 17-year-old go-getter\\
18 - with a valid driver's license\\
19 - and no chance at getting into college?\\
20 - Well, I could, but you know, since I've been single\\
21 - I find I really like shopping for myself.\\
22 - You're kidding. Why?\\
23 - Well, take this, for example.\\
24 - "Baco-berries." How could I put this on a list?\\
25 - I didn't even know it existed.\\
26 - I don't even know what it is.\\
27 - What is it, anyway?\\
28 - "Delicious dried cranberries infused with real bacon flavor""\\
29 - Ugh, that's disgusting.\\
30 - So... do you have a bunch of houses and yachts and stuff?\\
31 - Two houses, no yachts.\\
32 - You should totally get a yacht,\\
33 - and then hire someone to drive it for you.\\
34 - You know, like a 17-year-old go-getter\\
35 - with a valid yacht driver's license.\\
36 - Ah, yachts are pretentious.\\
37 - I don't believe in ostentatious displays of wealth.\\
38 - Besides, if I need to get anywhere,\\
39 - I'll just take my private jet.\\
40 - You have a jet?\\
41 - Yeah, and I already got a go-getter pilot.\\
42 - With a college degree.\\
43 - Excuse me, do you know the difference\\
44 - between "organic beef" and "grass-fed beef"?\\
45 - Yeah, "organic" is, uh, no antibiotics or growth hormones,\\
46 - but it can still be force-fed grain, which produces\\
47 - a less nutritious product than cows that are allowed\\
48 - to naturally graze on grass.\\
49 - Speaking of which, you're very pretty,\\
50 - and your accent makes me feel tingly inside.\\
51 - Speaking of which...?\\
52 - Cows, meat, cuts of steak,\\
53 - London Broil, England, your accent,\\
54 - 'ello!\\
55 - - Hello. I'm Zoey. - Walden.\\
56 - Nice to meet you, Walden.\\
57 - Your accent's rather charming, as well.\\
58 - Thanks.\\
59 - Good luck with your meat.\\
60 - Thanks.\\
61 - And they call me Forrest Gump.\\
62 - What?\\
63 - She was totally hitting on you.\\
64 - Really?\\
65 - You should ask her out.\\
66 - Okay.\\
67 - Hey, Zoey, you want to go on a date with me?\\
68 - Sure!\\

84 - Oh, I know that game--\\
85 - "Seven Card Screwed."\\

87 - And if I could just lose a little weight,\\
88 - I'd be a swimsuit model.\\
89 - Go ahead, say something, I dare you.\\
90 - Oh, no, no. It's an apt comparison.\\
91 - They both involve losing your ass.\\
92 - Well, I hate to do it,\\
93 - but I-I could ask Walden for a short-term loan.\\
94 - For God's sakes, Zippy, the man is already\\
95 - letting you and your kid live here rent-free.\\
96 - Don't you have any pride at all?\\
97 - Let me say that another way.\\
98 - Why do you think he's letting you stay here?\\
99 - Because he likes me.\\
100 - Because he likes having at least one person in his life\\
101 - that doesn't want anything from him.\\
102 - Somebody he thinks cares about him as a person.\\
103 - That's a good point.\\
104 - What you don't want him to find out\\
105 - is that you're just one of those nasty little birds\\
106 - that picks the food out of a hippo's teeth.\\
107 - No, we don't want that.\\
108 - So, listen, uh...\\
109 - I suppose, over the years,\\
110 - you've salted away a pretty good nest egg.\\
111 - You're not going to ask me for money.\\
112 - No, no! Just making conversation.\\
113 - Thanks for bringing in my groceries, man.\\
114 - I live to serve.\\
115 - Boy, I gotta tell you, Alan,\\
116 - your son made one heck of a wingman today.\\
117 - You make it easy, boss.\\
118 - Baby bird doesn't fly far from the teeth.\\
119 - So you, uh, you met somebody?\\
120 - Indeed I did.\\
121 - Beautiful woman. British.\\
122 - Actually drove her shopping cart on the wrong side of the aisle.\\
123 - That's a lot of credit cards.\\
124 - Uh, yeah.\\
125 - I've only got this one black one.\\
126 - I actually bought my plane with it.\\
127 - Oh, oh, oh! Which reminds me.\\
128 - Hey Jake, you want a quarter of a million\\
129 - frequent flyer miles? I can't use 'em, I got a plane.\\
130 - I want a quarter of a million anything.\\
131 - All yours, my man.\\
132 - Hmm, where could I go that's a quarter of a million miles away?\\
133 - How about the moon?\\
134 - That's ridiculous, Dad.\\
135 - I know, I was kidding.\\
136 - No one's ever been to the moon.\\
137 -     Men.    \\
138 - Here you go.\\
139 - State of the art.\\
140 - And semi-portable.\\
141 - Gateway computer.\\
142 - I haven't seen one of these in a while.\\
143 - Still works great. And it is loaded with software.\\
144 - Quicken 95, Lotus 1-2-3... um... WordPerfect, Tetris.\\
145 - I don't know, pal.\\
146 - I don't think I can move this.\\
147 - Oh, come on, help me out, I'm desperate.\\
148 - As opposed to most of the people who come in here.\\
149 - In my storeroom, I've got a couple of wheelchairs,\\
150 - a fishbowl full of glass eyes,\\
151 - and a "boy in the bubble" bag.\\
152 - To be clear, they took the boy out of the bubble\\
153 - and sold me the bag.\\
154 - Um...\\
155 - Uh, what would you give me for a pair of diamond cufflinks?\\
156 - Oh...\\
157 - Where'd you get these?\\
158 - My mother gave them to me when I graduated college.\\
159 - - Is she your real mother? - Yeah. Why?\\
160 - 'Cause these aren't real diamonds.\\
161 - What?!\\
162 - I'm sure she was a good mother in other ways.\\
163 - No, this is the nicest thing she ever did for me.\\
164 - I'm very sorry.\\
165 - All right. All right. I didn't want to have to sell this,\\
166 - but, uh, I suppose I'm out of options.\\
167 - Ooh.\\
168 - Oh, nice.\\
169 - Steuben crystal, huh?\\
170 - It is.\\
171 - Your mother didn't give you this.\\
172 - No. It was a wedding gift from my wife's parents.\\
173 - I managed to sneak it out of the house after the divorce.\\
174 - Uh-huh. Well, gimme a sec.\\
175 - I'll give you $1,200.\\
176 - Yes!\\
177 - No!\\
178 - I'll give you $2.00 to clean it up.\\
179 - Where's your broom?\\
180 -     Men.    \\
181 - Jake, I'm ready to go!\\
182 - Coming!\\
183 - Here you go, sir. The car is charged, washed,\\
184 - and I put an air freshener under your seat\\
185 - just in case you let one slip out.\\
186 - Good job.\\
187 - Hundred bucks! Thanks, boss.\\
188 - You gave him $100?\\
189 - Oh, hey, Alan. Yeah, he washed my car.\\
190 - A hundred bucks to wash a car?\\
191 - Not enough?\\
192 - For $100, I'd lick your car clean.\\
193 - Maybe next time.\\
194 - Hey, I'm going on a date with that girl\\
195 - I met in at supermarket. Do I look okay?\\
196 - No, I look okay.\\
197 - You look like the guy women fantasize about\\
198 - when I'm on top of them.\\
199 - Listen, I-I know you're still pretty new to the dating world,\\
200 - but can I give you a little advice?\\
201 - Is this about condoms?\\
202 - 'Cause Jake already gave me his lucky one.\\
203 - No. Uh...\\
204 - If you hope to have any kind of shot with this woman,\\
205 - you, uh, might want to lose the wedding ring.\\
206 - Really?\\
207 - Oh yeah.\\
208 - When it comes to dating,\\
209 - wedding rings are like kryptonite.\\
210 - If, you know, Superman was a... vagina.\\
211 - You know, I haven't taken this off in years.\\
212 - When Bridget and I first got together, we were pretty broke,\\
213 - so we just exchanged these cheap bands,\\
214 - but then, after I made my first million, I got matching ones\\
215 - made out of rhodium and platinum.\\
216 - In retrospect, I should've had them made out of poop and tears.\\
217 - Wait, uh... what's rhodium?\\
218 - It's the most expensive metal in the world.\\
219 - To symbolize how precious our love was.\\
220 - Well, that's... very romantic.\\
221 - But again, it's Lex Luthor for lady parts.\\
222 - Boy...\\
223 - This is gonna be tough.\\
224 - Wearing it makes me feel...\\
225 - secure.\\
226 - Be that as it may, you have a choice to make.\\
227 - Either the past, or the future.\\
228 - The memory of Bridget, or the promise of...\\
229 - supermarket strange.\\
230 - - Here. - Why are you giving it to me?\\
231 - Because you're right.\\
232 - I've got to move on with my life.\\
233 - And this ring is just an anchor chaining me to the past.\\
234 - Thanks, Al.\\
235 - Well, you are very welcome. Enjoy your date!\\
236 - Will do. See you.\\
237 - My precious!\\
238 -     Men.    \\
239 - So the young man you were with at the supermarket\\
240 - is no relation to you?\\
241 - Oh, no, Jake... Mm.\\
242 - is Alan's son.\\
243 - And Alan is...?\\
244 - Uh, it's complicated.\\
245 - I'm fairly bright, try me.\\
246 - Okay.\\
247 - Um, when I tried to kill myself in the ocean,\\
248 - Alan's house was the closest one with a phone.\\
249 - I see.\\
250 - - You don't, do you? - Not at all.\\
251 - - Okay, let me back up. - Please do.\\
252 - Okay, when I was in high school, I met this girl named Bridget.\\
253 - Is it really necessary to back up quite that far?\\
254 - You're right, I'll skip ahead.\\
255 - Let's see... I got married right after high school,\\
256 - happy, happy, happy.\\
257 - Made like a billion dollars, rich, rich, rich.\\
258 - She decided she didn't want to be married anymore,\\
259 - sad, sad, sad.\\
260 - In the ocean, out of the ocean,\\
261 - bought Alan's house, got rid of the furniture, kept Alan,\\
262 - got hungry, went to the supermarket, met you. The end.\\
263 - Wow.\\
264 - Enough about me. Let's talk about you.\\
265 - No, no, I have a few follow-up questions.\\
266 - The furniture?\\
267 - The suicide.\\
268 - Oh, it was just a cry for attention.\\
269 - I wanted Bridget to feel sorry for me.\\
270 - Well, that's rather pathetic.\\
271 - In hindsight, yeah.\\
272 - And the billion dollars?\\
273 - I sold a couple companies to Microsoft.\\
274 - Big mistake.\\
275 - Oh, you regret it?\\
276 - No, they do.\\
277 - How long's it been since your wife left?\\
278 - Four months, three weeks, four days, six hours and change.\\
279 - Let's just call it six hours.\\
280 - You're still in love with her, aren't you?\\
281 - You really are bright.\\
282 - I thought it was just your accent.\\
283 - It kind of raises the question,\\
284 - "Why on Earth did you ask me out""\\
285 - Jake told me to.\\
286 - Alan's son.\\
287 - Yeah, and also wanted to because I'm moving on with my life.\\
288 - See? Look, no wedding ring.\\
289 - Mmm, I noticed the bright white tan line.\\
290 - Yeah, it's almost like I still got it on.\\
291 - It is.\\
292 - No worries. I gave it to Alan.\\
293 - The man you kept instead of furniture.\\
294 - Well, it wasn't an either/or.\\
295 - What about you? What's your deal?\\
296 - My deal.\\
297 - All right, I'm a lawyer.\\
298 - Ugh! Ech!\\
299 - What else?\\
300 - Well, I'm divorced and I have\\
301 - a five-year-old daughter, Ava.\\
302 - I always wanted to have kids,\\
303 - but Bridget insisted that we already had one.\\
304 - I don't follow.\\
305 - Me.\\
306 - Oh, sure, I can see that.\\
307 - What do you think?\\
308 - Are we gonna fall in love and stuff?\\
309 - What?\\
310 - 'Cause that would really teach Bridget a lesson.\\
311 - Hi, again.\\
312 - Oy gevalt.\\
313 - I, uh, brought something else for you.\\
314 - My sphincter's tight with anticipation.\\
315 - Platinum and rhodium.\\
316 - Whoa.\\
317 - Oh...\\
318 - very valuable.\\
319 - Did you steal it?\\
320 - What?\\
321 - I'm only asking because it affects my marketing strategy.\\
322 - No, it was a gift.\\
323 - A gift.\\
324 - Mmm-hmm.\\
325 - Heh. Good enough for me.\\
326 - What are you looking to get for it?\\
327 - Let's not play this game.\\
328 - Just... just tell me what it's worth to you.\\
329 - What is this, your phone number?\\
330 - That's my offer.\\
331 - Hang on a sec.\\
332 - You know that's helium?\\
333 - Hmm?\\
334 - A down-on-his-luck birthday clown.\\
335 - Son of a bitch!\\
336 -     Men.    \\
337 - This was a lovely evening, Walden.\\
338 - Thank you.\\
339 - You're welcome.\\
340 - Hmm. Well, better\\
341 - get in, let Ava's babysitter go home.\\
342 - Oh, is she still up? Can I meet her?\\
343 - I'm sure she's still up, but no.\\
344 - Oh, I get it.\\
345 - You want to know make sure a guy's gonna be\\
346 - around a while before you introduce him-- me.\\
347 - Exactly.\\
348 - So, maybe after the third or fourth date?\\
349 - I don't think so.\\
350 - Well, the fifth or sixth?\\
351 - No.\\
352 - Seventh or eighth?\\
353 - I'm starting to get a bad feeling.\\
354 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
355 - You seem like a really sweet guy,\\
356 - but I think you're still kind of married to your Bridget.\\
357 - No, no, I'm not.\\
358 - I haven't been wearing my ring for, like,\\
359 - like, almost three hours now.\\
360 - It may be off your finger, but it's still in your head.\\
361 - Face it, you're not ready to be dating yet.\\
362 - Thanks again for dinner.\\
363 - Still married.\\
364 - That is so untrue.\\
365 - Bridget, you're not gonna believe what just happened.\\
366 -     Men.    \\
367 - Walden?\\
368 - Walden?!\\
369 - Down here!\\
370 - Hey.\\
371 - Hey.\\
372 - How's your date?\\
373 - Not so good.\\
374 - Oh. So much for Jake's lucky condom, huh?\\
375 - Yeah, we never got to condoms.\\
376 - She thinks I'm still too hung up on Bridget.\\
377 - No kidding.\\
378 - And the worst part is Bridget agrees with her.\\
379 - Well, I might as well put my ring back on.\\
380 - You, uh, you, uh, want-want your ring back?\\
381 - Yeah.\\
382 - Here.\\
383 - Thanks.\\
384 - I had a feeling sooner or later you'd want it.\\
385 - No. You know what? I was right the first time.\\
386 - I don't need this anymore.\\
387 - Are you sure?\\
388 - I'm positive.\\
389 - I feel better already.\\
390 - Oh, good.\\
391 - All right, I'm gonna go inside.\\
392 - Okay, I'm just, I'm just gonna hang here for a while.\\
393 - Okay. Good night.\\
394 - Yeah. Night.\\
395 - My precious! My precious! My precious!\\
396 - My precious! My precious!\\
397 - My precious!\\
398 - You saw that?\\
399 - Yeah.\\
400 - Probably wondering what it was all about.\\
401 - Kinda.\\
402 - Well... I often enjoy\\
403 - a, uh, brisk moonlight swim.\\
404 - Fully clothed?\\
405 - You leave your clothes on the beach,\\
406 - a drifter... steals 'em.\\
407 - Alan...\\
408 - I was trying to get your ring back.\\
409 - But I don't want it back.\\
410 - No, not-not for you.\\
411 - Um, for me.\\
412 - I was gonna pawn it.\\
413 - Why?\\
414 - What do you mean, why? I need money.\\
415 - I can't possibly produce enough sperm and blood\\
416 - to get out of the hole I'm in.\\
417 - In fact, I went to the pawn shop\\
418 - while you were on your date.\\
419 - But you didn't pawn it.\\
420 - I couldn't.\\
421 - Wow, you must have been freaking out\\
422 - when I threw it in the ocean, huh?\\
423 - The truth of that stands dripping before you.\\
424 - Listen, if you needed money,\\
425 - why didn't you just ask?\\
426 - You'd lend me money if I just asked?\\
427 - No. I don't believe in lending money.\\
428 - I just give it away.\\
429 - Give it away?\\
430 - Yeah, I think it's a bad idea to lend people money.\\
431 - They never pay you back,\\
432 - and then you just end up resenting them.\\
433 - So how much do you need?\\
434 - Uh...\\
435 - No, no, I can't, I can't take your money.\\
436 - What, you're too proud?\\
437 - Oh, God, no, I-I-I haven't had any pride\\
438 - since the gym showers in seventh grade.\\
439 - No, no, if I took your money,\\
440 - that would change our relationship,\\
441 - and I don't want that.\\
442 - I want you to think of me as a friend and not a freeloader.\\
443 - You don't think that ship's already sailed?\\
444 - Allow me at least the illusion of self-respect.\\
445 - Would it help your self-respect if I started charging you rent?\\
446 - Actually, it would.\\
447 - Consider it done.\\
448 - Great.\\
449 - Oh, I'm gonna be late this month.\\
450 - No problem.\\
451 - Probably next month, too.\\
452 - Thanks for the heads up.\\
453 - Okay. I guess I better go dry off.\\
454 - Hey, Alan. Yeah?\\
455 - You're a quality guy.\\
456 - Really?\\
457 - I have a lot of people that say they're my friend,\\
458 - but you really are one.\\
459 - Well, thanks.\\
460 - Just-just out of curiosity, if I had asked for, say,\\
461 - a hundred thousand dollars,\\
462 - would you have given it to me?\\
463 - Absolutely.\\
464 - Where you going?\\
465 - Back in the ocean.\\
466 - Hello?\\
467 - Oh, hey, Jake.\\
468 - No, your dad's kind of busy right now.\\
469 - What's up?\\
470 - Oh, you used the frequent flier miles?\\
471 - That's great. Where are you?\\

14 - You seem like a really sweet guy,\\
15 - but I think you're still kind of married to your Bridget.\\
16 - Face it, you're not ready to be dating yet.\\
17 - You want your ring back?\\
18 - Yeah.\\
19 - I don't need this anymore.\\
20 - You sure?\\
21 - I'm positive.\\
22 - My precious! My precious!\\
23 - My precious! My precious!\\
24 - My precious!\\
25 - Mind if I take this?\\
26 - Oh, uh, no-- somebody's sitting there.\\
27 - Well, where are they?\\
28 - They're not here yet.\\
29 - Well, I'm here and I need a chair.\\
30 - No, uh...\\
31 - honestly, I have a girl coming.\\
32 - Well, when she gets here, I'll give it back to her.\\
33 - See, I don't believe that.\\
34 - You calling me a liar?\\
35 - No, but I've been burnt before.\\
36 - I'm taking this chair.\\
37 - No, you're not.\\
38 - Yes, I am. Let go!\\
39 - You let go of the chair.\\
40 - I had the chair before you even came into the place.\\
41 - - It's mine now! - It's my chair now!\\
42 - Walden, is everything all right?\\
43 - Ha! She's here. Now back off!\\
44 - What was that all about?\\
45 - It was an attempt at a chairjacking.\\
46 - Here, I get you a tea.\\
47 - Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.\\
48 - I'm trying to get my daughter into Bellwood Academy.\\
49 - It's a nightmare.\\
50 - She tests well, but she did not give a good interview.\\
51 - How old is your daughter again?\\
52 - Five.\\
53 - And Bellwood Academy is a...? Kindergarten.\\
54 - Wow, when I was five, I got kicked out of preschool\\
55 - for biting my teacher.\\
56 - Why did you bite her?\\
57 - She tried to steal my chair.\\
58 - Yeah, you heard me! I bit her!\\
59 - She had to get a shot!\\
60 - Take it easy, okay?\\
61 - So I was rather surprised\\
62 - to hear from you. What's up?\\
63 - I was thinking a lot about what you said about not wanting\\
64 - to date me while I was still, you know,\\
65 - emotionally attached to my ex-wife.\\
66 - I said you were still hopelessly in love with her.\\
67 - Potato, Po-tah-to.\\
68 - The point is you were right.\\
69 - I wasn't ready to start dating, but I am now.\\
70 - A whole week later.\\
71 - I understand your skepticism.\\
72 - Which is why I want you to witness what I'm about to do.\\
73 - These...\\
74 - are my final divorce papers.\\
75 - And once I sign them, my marriage will be over forever.\\
76 - I was hoping that you and I could start fresh.\\
77 - Nothing like starting off a new relationship\\
78 - on the ashes of the old one.\\
79 - That's what I was thinking.\\
80 - Oh, uh, you got a pen?\\
81 - Uh, I don't think I do.\\
82 - Okay.\\
83 - Uh, does anybody got a pen I can borrow?\\
84 - Anyone? Nobody?\\
85 - Excuse me.\\
86 - Do you got a pen?\\
87 - Sorry.\\
88 - It's unbelievable.\\
89 - Oh, man.\\
90 - Can I please borrow your pen?\\
91 - I'm sorry, someone's using it.\\
92 - Who?\\
93 - They're not here yet.\\
94 - I will give you a hundred dollars to borrow that pen.\\

104 - Jolly good sunset, eh, what?\\
105 - Excuse me?\\
106 - I like the way you talk,\\
107 - so I thought I'd give it a go.\\
108 - Well, no one says "jolly good" unless they're appearing in\\
109 - a revival of Oliver.\\
110 - Right, right, right, right, right, right.\\
111 - Please, sir, may I have a kiss?\\
112 - Stop it!\\
113 - No, seriously, I want a kiss.\\
114 - All right.\\
115 - - Mm. So... - Hmm?\\
116 - would you like to stay for dinner tonight?\\
117 - Oh, I'd love to, but I have to pick up my daughter.\\
118 - - Yeah? - Mm-hmm.\\
119 - - How about dinner this weekend? - Sure.\\
120 - Great. You like Mexican food?\\
121 - I do.\\
122 - Ooh, terrific.\\
123 - So we'll go to Guadalajara.\\
124 - Oh, that a new restaurant?\\
125 - No, it's an old city in Mexico.\\
126 - You want to go to Mexico for dinner?\\
127 - Yep. We'll take my plane.\\
128 - I'll have you back by midnight.\\
129 - So, hang on-- you-you don't own a pen,\\
130 - but you own a plane?\\
131 - Yeah, you can always borrow a pen.\\
132 - Try to borrow a plane.\\
133 - - So... - Mm?\\
134 - what do you say?\\
135 - Hmm... Let me see if I can get a sitter.\\
136 - Oh!\\
137 - Yay!\\
138 - - Mm-hmm. - You know, I think we should\\
139 - start making plans for Christmas.\\
140 - We can go surfing in Fiji, skiing in the Alps,\\
141 - making out in Malibu.\\
142 - Yes, now, Walden, let's be very clear:\\
143 - You are a sweet and wonderful guy,\\
144 - but you've just come out\\
145 - of a very long-term relationship, - Sweet and wonderful.\\
146 - so you're clearly on the rebound.\\
147 - Uh-huh. So?\\
148 - Yes. So I don't know\\
149 - if we should be making Christmas plans just yet.\\
150 - - Okay. - Hmm?\\
151 - Fine. We'll slow things down.\\
152 - Good.\\
153 - Forget Christmas.\\
154 - Thank you.\\
155 - You'll be my Valentine, though, right?\\
156 - Oh, my God.\\
157 - You're like no man I've ever met.\\
158 - Mmm! A bit of an odd bloke, eh, what?\\
159 - Oh, God, stop it.\\
160 - Nudge, nudge, wink, wink, say no more.\\
161 - This is nice. Like old times.\\
162 - How so?\\
163 - You and me, sitting here, watching TV\\
164 - while the good-looking owner of the house is\\
165 - out on the deck swapping spit with a hot chick.\\
166 - Yeah, there is a bit of deja vu.\\
167 - Not only that.\\
168 - It feels like it's happened before.\\
169 - Yes, it does.\\
170 - Man, I've seen so much crazy stuff in this house,\\
171 - I could write a book.\\
172 - That's a good idea. Got a title?\\
173 - Hmm...\\
174 - Maybe I can't write a book.\\
175 - All right then, cheerio!\\
176 - Cheerio?\\
177 - Means "good-bye" in England.\\
178 - Oh.\\
179 - What do they have for breakfast over there,\\
180 - a bowl of good-byes?\\
181 - - 'Ello, lads. - Well, hey.\\
182 - So, Zoey seems very nice.\\
183 - Yeah, the bird really tickles my fancy.\\
184 - Help me out here.\\
185 - Is "fancy" the English word for "nutsack"?\\
186 - No, it means that I like her.\\
187 - I think this could get serious.\\
188 - Wow, you're moving pretty quick, aren't you?\\
189 - That's what she said.\\
190 - What are you laughing at?\\
191 - He did a "That's what she said" joke.\\
192 - Because that's what she said.\\
193 - Oh. That's not funny.\\
194 - She thinks I'm on the rebound.\\
195 - Well, aren't you?\\
196 - You were with Bridget for 15 years.\\
197 - That's over. I signed the divorce papers.\\
198 - I'm ready to fall in love again.\\
199 - Please tell me you didn't actually say that to her.\\
200 - Why?\\
201 - Dude, even I know that's wrong.\\
202 - Walden, you're young, you're rich, you're handsome.\\
203 - If I was even one of those things\\
204 - I would have screwed myself to death years ago.\\
205 - Well, I want to be in a relationship...\\
206 - with romance and intimacy and commitment.\\
207 - Oh, I get it. You're a chick.\\
208 - Jake, we're living in his house.\\
209 - A very nice chick.\\
210 - This is absolutely ridiculous.\\
211 - You don't have to wear the hat if you don't want to.\\
212 - It's not the hat. Well, it's not totally the hat.\\
213 - It's the incredible extravagance.\\
214 - You do realize I'm still not ready to sleep with you, yes?\\
215 - Oh, I'm not trying to have sex with you.\\
216 - Why not? What's wrong with me?\\
217 - Nothing. Why? Do you want to have sex with me?\\
218 - Yeah! No! No, it's too soon. It's too soon.\\
219 - Well, is it too soon...\\
220 - for this?\\
221 - Oh, God, Walden, what have you done?\\
222 - What do you think?\\
223 - I think you're out of your bloody mind.\\
224 - I can't accept this.\\
225 - Why not?\\
226 - Because it's too much.\\
227 - It's crazy!\\
228 - What about getting a diamond necklace for a girl\\
229 - you've haven't slept with yet\\
230 - while flying to Mexico for dinner\\
231 - on your private jet is crazy?\\
232 - Okay, when I say it out loud\\
233 - it does sound a little crazy.\\
234 - Good thing I didn't get you the matching tiara.\\
235 - Okay, uh, there might be one other thing.\\
236 - Oh, God, you didn't buy me a pony, did you?\\
237 - No. Why, do you want one?\\
238 - No, I don't.\\
239 - The thing is, I know some people\\
240 - on the board of the private school\\
241 - you're trying to get your daughter in,\\
242 - so I pulled some strings and got her enrolled.\\
243 - Wait-- you got Ava into Bellwood?\\
244 - But don't worry, one phone call and she's out on her ass.\\
245 - No, don't do that!\\
246 - Walden, this is wonderful!\\
247 - You're not upset?\\
248 - No! No, no, no.\\
249 - What you did is brilliant.\\
250 - Mm! Utterly brilliant.\\
251 - Mr. Schmidt, we'll be descending\\
252 - into Guadalajara in a few minutes.\\
253 - Circle, circle!\\
254 - Excuse me?\\
255 - He's about to descend into London.\\
256 - Hello, Heathrow!\\
257 - Oh, God, that is not funny.\\
258 - What a lovely landing strip.\\
259 -     Men.    \\
260 - - Morning. - Morning.\\
261 - Want to explain the hat?\\
262 - It's not a hat, it's a sombrero.\\
263 - "Sombrero" is Spanish for "hat""\\
264 - Really? Seems awfully complicated.\\
265 - Why don't they just call it a hat?\\
266 - No, not worth it.\\
267 - - Morning. - Morning.\\
268 - Cameron Diaz, se  or.\\
269 - - Cameron Diaz? - Choose your battles.\\
270 - Right.\\
271 - So, how'd it go last night?\\
272 - It was great.\\
273 - I think I'm falling in love.\\
274 - Oh, Walden, that's muy grande chiquita.\\
275 - Hey, man...\\
276 - I really don't appreciate you making fun of me.\\
277 - Sorry.\\
278 - I'll get it.\\
279 - Who knew he spoke Spanish?\\
280 -     Zoey, Zoey, Zoey, Zoe, Zoey...    \\
281 - Bridget.\\
282 - I can't sign the divorce papers.\\
283 - I love you and I want you back.\\
284 - Oh, bollocks.\\
285 -     Men.    \\
286 - Wait... whoa, whoa, wait, I...\\
287 - I don't understand.\\
288 - You're the one who wanted the divorce.\\
289 - I know-- I thought it's what I wanted,\\
290 - but when I saw your name on the papers,\\
291 - I just, I couldn't sign.\\
292 - Ay, Chihuahua.\\
293 - Stop it.\\
294 - Sorry, it's the hat.\\
295 - Is everything okay? You don't look happy.\\
296 - Yeah, no, yeah, it's great.\\
297 - I just...\\
298 - What about that doctor you were dating?\\
299 - Alex?\\
300 - I saw him. He's a dreamboat.\\
301 - The truth is, he was just a rebound thing.\\
302 - Yeah, but rebounds work out sometimes.\\
303 - I mean, take Abe Lincoln.\\
304 - He met his wife on a rebound,\\
305 - and, and they had a long-term relationship.\\
306 - Until, you know...\\
307 - Hm... I didn't know Abe Lincoln killed himself.\\
308 - How many rebounds have you had since we broke up?\\
309 - Well...\\
310 - It's a trap, don't answer.\\
311 - None that meant anything.\\
312 - Yes!\\
313 - I mean, I haven't exactly been celibate.\\
314 - - Oh, no, no, no, no, no! - But I haven't been a slut, either.\\
315 - Attaboy.\\
316 - Come on, let's go upstairs.\\
317 - - Really? - Don't you want to?\\
318 - Well, yeah, I want to.\\
319 - I just, I-I...shouldn't we be taking it slow?\\
320 - We've been married for 15 years, Walden.\\
321 - Come on.\\
322 - Okay.\\
323 - - Hello. - Hey.\\
324 - Hi.\\
325 - It's very weird that you live with these people.\\
326 - So what's he gonna do about Zoey?\\
327 - Well, unless I miss my guess,\\
328 - he's gonna lie to both of them until it blows up in his face,\\
329 - and everyone gets their feelings hurt,\\
330 - and he's left alone and miserable.\\
331 - Wow. That sucks. Isn't there a better way to\\
332 - date two women at the same time?\\
333 - Aw, Jake...\\
334 - No.\\
335 - I want you so badly.\\
336 - Yeah, yep, I, uh...\\
337 - ...want you too. I was such a fool.\\
338 - I can't believe I let someone as great as you get away.\\
339 - Wait, you said I was immature.\\
340 - You are, but that's part of your charm.\\
341 - I love you, Walden.\\
342 - I love you, I love you, I love you.\\
343 - That is awesome.\\
344 - Uh...\\
345 - Just... okay, okay, well...\\
346 - Can we just hold on for one second?\\
347 - - Where are you going? - Uh, the bathroom.\\
348 - Why don't you just use that one?\\
349 - I'm a little pee shy.\\
350 - I don't want you to hear me.\\
351 - Since when?\\
352 - It's a new thing.\\
353 - People change, Bridget, people grow.\\
354 - Do you think you and Mom would ever get back together?\\
355 - Well, you know I will always care for your mother.\\
356 - She's a terrific lady, and a great mom,\\
357 - and no one can predict the future...\\
358 - but no freakin' way.\\
359 - She said the same thing.\\
360 - But used a different word than "freakin'."\\
361 - - Hey. - Hey.\\
362 - Hey.\\
363 - Everything all right?\\
364 - Uh, no. As Zoey would say,\\
365 - I'm in a bit of a sticky wicket.\\
366 - You mean you were in a sticky wicket,\\
367 - then you finished up and came down here for a snack.\\
368 - No, no, I-I have a conundrum.\\
369 - Then you should've worn it.\\
370 - Might've avoided the stickiness, you know, wicket-wise.\\
371 - Okay, I'm just going to talk to you.\\
372 - Please.\\
373 - I've been dreaming about getting back together with Bridget\\
374 - for months now, but since I met Zoey, I'm not so sure.\\
375 - - It is a pickle. - What's a pickle?\\
376 - Shh.\\
377 - What does your heart tell you?\\
378 - My heart tells me that\\
379 - Bridget is the past, and Zoey is the future.\\
380 - Oh, I get it. You're trying to figure out\\
381 - which one gets your pickle.\\
382 - Essentially, yes.\\
383 - Well, then, I say follow your heart.\\
384 - I say follow your pickle.\\
385 - Try to ignore him.\\
386 - I've been with Bridget for 15 years.\\
387 - That's tough to just walk away from.\\
388 - But as you said yourself, Bridget's the past.\\
389 - Yeah, but if I get back together with her,\\
390 - I don't have to give up $600 million\\
391 - in a divorce settlement.\\
392 - The future's overrated. Go with Bridget.\\
393 - I mean, it does make sense, right? All I'd have to do\\
394 - is sell this place and move back in with her.\\
395 - You can't live your life in the past.\\
396 - - Go with Zoey. - You think?\\
397 - I do. And I don't have a horse in this race.\\
398 - No, you're right.\\
399 - Zoey it is.\\
400 - Thank you, Alan.\\
401 - Cheerios!\\
402 - You have no shame, do you?\\
403 - Shame, no.\\
404 - Malibu beach house, yes.\\
405 - Welcome back.\\
406 - Oh, boy.\\
407 - Bridget, I can't remember--\\
408 - do you like your Band-Aids taken off quick or slow?\\
409 - I don't understand.\\
410 - Let's just go with quick.\\
411 - I don't think it's a good idea to sleep with you,\\
412 - since I started seeing someone new\\
413 - and I think she might be the real deal.\\
414 - Not that you weren't the real deal,\\
415 - you're just the ex-real deal,\\
416 - and she's the next real deal.\\
417 - Anyway, I'd like for you you to sign the divorce papers,\\
418 - so we can both go meet people we like better.\\
419 - - What? - Friends?\\
420 - - I am so humiliated! - I'm sorry!\\
421 - I can't believe you waited till I was half naked in your bed\\
422 - to tell me you were seeing someone else!\\
423 - Kind of hard to bring up while you're taking off my pants.\\
424 - And by the way, you look sensational.\\
425 - The Pilates is really paying off.\\
426 - Go to hell, you son of a bitch!\\
427 - How about an "attaboy" for not\\
428 - having sex with you out of respect for the other woman\\
429 - I'm falling in love with?\\
430 - Drop dead!\\
431 - How many times have we seen this movie?\\
432 - Too many to count.\\
433 - Maybe it's the house.\\
434 - - What do you mean? - I think it's haunted.\\
435 - Like, built on an angry woman burial ground.\\
436 - Certainly can't be the fault of the men who live in it.\\
437 - Sometimes at night, if I'm really quiet,\\
438 - I think I can hear them bitching.\\
439 - That didn't go as well as I'd hoped.\\
440 - I wouldn't worry about it.\\
441 - She doesn't look like the type to carry a grudge.\\
442 - But I don't know her like you do.\\
443 - Haunted...\\
444 -     Men.    \\
445 -     Men.    \\
446 - So the madam of the brothel opens the door\\
447 - and there's a man on the stoop with no arms and no legs.\\
448 - And she says, "What do you think you're going to do here?"\\
449 - And he says, "I rang the bell, didn't I?"\\
450 - You're terrible.\\
451 - Did he break your heart?\\
452 - Who are you?\\
453 - That doesn't matter.\\
454 - Do you want him back, or do you want him to suffer?\\
455 - I don't know.\\
456 - That's all right.\\
457 - Oftentimes, they're the same thing.\\
458 - Come with me, and I'll teach you.\\

9 - Well, you gave me a pretty nice present last night.\\
10 - Actually two.\\
11 - You're terrible.\\
12 - Open it.\\
13 - Dare I say it? Key to your heart?\\
14 - Better. It's a key to my house.\\
15 - Walden, I can't accept a key to your house.\\
16 - It's a bit premature.\\
17 - Well, if anything in our relationship's going to be premature,\\
18 - I prefer it to be the house key.\\
19 - It's a very sweet gesture.\\
20 - Mistletoe.\\
21 - Oh, my!\\
22 - I've got to pick up my daughter from her father's\\

30 - Walden, we're still getting to know each other.\\
31 - - I know you. - Really?\\
32 - What color are my eyes then?\\
33 - Brown. the left one's got a little fleck of green in it.\\
34 - Damn.\\
35 - You say you're a size two, but you're actually a size four.\\
36 - You run the water in the bathroom\\
37 - to cover the sound of you peeing.\\
38 - All right fine. Let me put it another way.\\
39 - No families this year.\\

67 - How about three weeks pay and another kiss on the cheek?\\
68 - Do I get to pick the cheek?\\
69 - Merry Christmas.\\
70 - Merry Christmas.\\
71 - Hey, Mom, where are you?\\
72 - Oh, okay, that's about ten miles away...\\
73 - and it's rush hour, so figure... three hours.\\
74 - Yeah, I can't wait to see you, too.\\
75 - So I'm thinking that since\\
76 - this is our first Christmas without Charlie,\\
77 - we should spend it together.\\
78 - Yes, Mom, I'd rather get laid, too...\\
79 - but I think family is more important.\\
80 - Hey, Mom.\\
81 - Yeah, I'm just driving to Dad's.\\
82 - In 500 feet, turn left.\\
83 - Yes, I'm seeing someone.\\
84 - No, you can't meet her.\\
85 - Because it's too soon.\\
86 - I don't know what it means.\\
87 - It's just what she keeps telling me.\\
88 - Uh, Mom, y-you're breaking up.\\
89 - I-I'm sorry, what did you say?\\
90 - Y-Y-You want a tuna sandwich?\\
91 - Oh, oh, you're in a two-man sandwich.\\
92 - Uh, well, I, I hope they're using condiments.\\
93 - Uh, well, listen, I-I-I got to go, I got another call.\\
94 - Dear Lord.\\
95 - Hello.\\
96 - Oh, Jake, merry Christmas.\\
97 - Hey, Dad, I just wanted to call\\
98 - and tell you merry Christmas and wish you happy holidays.\\
99 - No, no, Mom and Herb are out to dinner.\\
100 - I'm just chilling at the ski lodge.\\
101 - Room service.\\
102 - Oh, hang on.\\
103 - I ordered a cheeseburger.\\
104 - Got to go, Dad.\\
105 - Yeah, I know the tip's included.\\
106 - All right, bye.\\
107 - All right, now you call your mom\\
108 - and tell her you're with your dad.\\
109 - Hey, Mom, I'm with your dad.\\
110 - No, no.\\
111 -     Men.    \\
112 - This is gonna be the best Christmas ever.\\
113 - Yeah, swell.\\
114 - I got a great new girlfriend.\\
115 - My girlfriend's got a great new boyfriend.\\
116 - My mom is coming.\\
117 - So is mine.\\
118 - Wherever she is.\\
119 - Went to the Apple Store\\
120 - and bought myself a bunch of cool presents.\\
121 - I went to the grocery store and got myself an apple.\\
122 - Sounds like somebody's got the holiday blues.\\
123 - Oh, little bit.\\
124 - My son's with his mother and her husband,\\
125 - and this is my first Christmas without Charlie.\\
126 - What would you two normally do?\\
127 - Oh, we had kind of a holiday tradition.\\
128 - Um, he would drink a gallon of eggnog\\
129 - and then try to throw me out of the house at gunpoint.\\
130 - Good times.\\
131 - Well, you're not going to spend this year alone.\\
132 - You're going to have Christmas with me and my mom.\\
133 - Well, thank you, that's very nice of you.\\
134 - You want to hear a funny idea?\\
135 - You and my mom are about the same age.\\
136 - If you guys started dating and got married,\\
137 - you'd be my new daddy.\\
138 - Wait, h-hold on, I-I'm your mom's age?\\
139 - How old do you think I am?\\
140 - I don't know, what, like 60?\\
141 - I'm 44.\\
142 - Oh, well, you look older.\\
143 - Oh, there she is.\\
144 - That's it.\\
145 - Tomorrow I start moisturizing.\\
146 - - Mom. - Baby.\\
147 - Eyeball, eyeball.\\
148 - Nose and mouth.\\
149 - I love you north.\\
150 - I love you south.\\
151 - Hey, Alan, meet my mother Robin.\\
152 - Nice to meet you, Alan.\\
153 - Likewise.\\
154 - Mom, let me show you my place.\\
155 - Check it out, I got my own ocean.\\
156 - Well, it's not completely mine.\\
157 - I have to share the other side with Japan.\\
158 - It's very nice, dear.\\
159 - Yeah, I'm rich.\\
160 - Well... I know what I want for Christmas.\\
161 -     Men.    \\
162 - So how long have you two been living together?\\
163 - A couple of months.\\
164 - I see.\\
165 - I'm sorry, I-I have to ask.\\
166 - Is this the woman you don't want me to meet?\\
167 - What?\\
168 - No.\\
169 - No, Alan is just a friend.\\
170 - Tell her.\\
171 - Butch and Sundance, not Brokeback Mountain.\\
172 - Okay, sorry.\\
173 - I-I mean, you have to admit, it's a rather strange set-up--\\
174 - a 33-year-old man living with a 60-year-old.\\
175 - I'm 44.\\
176 - Right, me, too.\\
177 - Alan helped me through my break-up with Bridget,\\
178 - and then he needed a place to stay,\\
179 - so I asked him to stick around.\\
180 - Oh, that is so like you.\\
181 - When Walden was a little boy,\\
182 - he used to bring home sick, helpless animals all the time.\\
183 - God help me, I can't take that as an insult.\\
184 - So, uh, what do you do, Robin?\\
185 - I'm a primatologist.\\
186 - I, I work mainly with gorillas.\\
187 - Oh, oh, so I guess that makes you the gorilla my dreams.\\
188 - It was hysterical when Bugs Bunny did it.\\
189 - And thanks to the financial support\\
190 - of my brilliant son, I have a private\\
191 - gorilla sanctuary in Temecula.\\
192 - Oh, no kidding?\\
193 - Yeah, we take gorillas\\
194 - who were born in captivity\\
195 - and those who have lost their wild habitats\\
196 - and provide them with a safe, stable,\\
197 - loving family environment.\\
198 - Oh, that sounds wonderful.\\
199 - Does one have to be a gorilla to apply for admittance?\\
200 - I'm afraid so.\\
201 - Story of my life.\\
202 - When I was little, I always wanted\\
203 - to play with the gorillas.\\
204 - I even made up my own imaginary gorilla friend.\\
205 - Remember Magilla, Mom?\\
206 - Hmm, yeah, but he wasn't imaginary.\\
207 - What?\\
208 - Walden, Magilla lived with us\\
209 - for the first four years of your life.\\
210 - He was real?\\
211 - Yeah.\\
212 - Do you want to see some pictures?\\
213 - Wait, w-w-wait, Magilla was real?\\
214 - Very much so.\\
215 - Wait, you actually had a gorilla living with you?\\
216 - Yep, I was doing experiments to see if gorillas could learn\\
217 - as fast as human children, so\\
218 - I raised Magilla and Walden together from birth.\\
219 - Wow.\\
220 - All we had was a schnauzer and an Argentinean tennis pro.\\
221 - Uncle Javier.\\
222 - The tennis pro, not the schnauzer.\\
223 - Hold on a second, I was raised with a gorilla?\\
224 - Oh, well, just until you started preschool.\\
225 - Now, look, here's you and Magilla together in your crib.\\
226 - And here's\\
227 - the two of you at your first birthday.\\
228 - Wait a minute,\\
229 - is that how I learned sign language?\\
230 - I'm sorry, I don't have any bananas.\\
231 - Look, there's the two of you\\
232 - on the playground.\\
233 - Oh, your first Halloween.\\
234 - You went as a gorilla,\\
235 - and Magilla went as a ghost.\\
236 - Whoa, whoa.\\
237 - Yeah, okay. Yeah, it's starting to come back to me.\\
238 - Like, riding tricycles together,\\
239 - and running... running around the house.\\
240 - Or playing hide in the closet.\\
241 - Wait. Why were we always hiding in the closet?\\
242 - Well, the Homeowners Association didn't allow cats or dogs.\\
243 - What would they have said about a gorilla?\\
244 - Yeah. I remember.\\
245 - You told me he was my brother.\\
246 - Well, in a sense, he was.\\
247 - And then one day, he was gone.\\
248 - Yeah.\\
249 - You said he got sent back to the jungle.\\
250 - Well, sweetheart, we didn't have any choice.\\
251 - He was getting too big. He, uh...\\
252 - He tried to kill a Jehovah's Witness.\\
253 - Now, Now, to be fair, who among us hasn't...\\
254 - Not now, Alan.\\
255 - This is really starting to freak me out.\\
256 - Well, sweetie, I-I don't understand\\
257 - why you're making such a big deal out of this.\\
258 - You're kidding, right?\\
259 - I-I just discovered that my brother is a gorilla!\\
260 - That's-That's kind of a big deal!\\
261 - Hey, my brother was a pig, so, I mean...\\
262 - I said, not now, Alan!\\
263 - Walden, calm down.\\
264 - You do realize that I spent my entire childhood\\
265 - worrying that if I misbehaved,\\
266 - I would get sent away to the jungle like Magilla!\\
267 - One false move, Zimbabwe!\\
268 - Well, sweetheart, I...\\
269 - I never knew that you felt like that.\\
270 - Of course you didn't.\\
271 - You were so busy doing your experiment!\\
272 - Walden!\\
273 - Kids, huh?\\
274 - So, you seeing anybody?\\
275 -     Men.    \\
276 -     Men.    \\
277 - Walden, it's Mom. Where are you?\\
278 - Please call me back so we can talk about this.\\
279 - I had no idea he'd repressed all those childhood memories.\\
280 - Well, apparently,\\
281 - losing what he thought was his sibling was very traumatic.\\
282 - I'm wondering if maybe I have to rethink his Christmas gift.\\
283 - Why? What did you get him?\\
284 - A bathrobe.\\
285 - Yeah, not a good idea.\\
286 - And I can't even return it.\\
287 - It's slightly irregular.\\
288 - You must think I'm a terrible mother.\\
289 - Well, let's compare mothering techniques.\\
290 - Um, did you tell him that Disneyland burned down\\
291 - to avoid having to take him there\\
292 - for his sixth, seventh and eighth birthdays?\\
293 - No.\\
294 - Did you tell him to walk it off\\
295 - after his appendix burst?\\
296 - No.\\
297 - Did you tell me the only reason you got pregnant\\
298 - was because you didn't want to smear your lipstick?\\
299 - Of course not!\\
300 - Then, far as I'm concerned,\\
301 - you're Mother of the Freakin' Year. Hmm.\\
302 - Mm. Although I did store Walden's embryo\\
303 - in a cryogenic chamber until Magilla's mother got pregnant\\
304 - so they could be born at the same time.\\
305 - Okay, flag on the play.\\
306 - You did what?\\
307 - I needed my child and the gorilla\\
308 - to be born at the same time for the experiment to be valid.\\
309 - And your husband was okay with this?\\
310 - It was for science.\\
311 - And I may not have told him.\\
312 - Okay, well, well, after all that time and energy,\\
313 - what did you learn?\\
314 - My son is smarter than a gorilla.\\
315 - Mine's not.\\
316 -     Men.    \\
317 - Oh, Walden, what are you doing here?\\
318 - My brother is a gorilla, and she sent him away.\\
319 - I'm sorry. Is that some sort of American Christmas Carol?\\
320 - No. It's a succinct summation\\
321 - of my seminal years with a simian sibling.\\
322 - Are you drunk?\\
323 - I ought to be. I've taken the necessary steps.\\
324 - Sweetie, this isn't a very good time.\\
325 - You're telling me.\\
326 - My mother is a mad scientist,\\
327 - and I spent the first four years of my life\\
328 - flinging poop with my brother... the gorilla.\\
329 - Hello!\\
330 - Mummy and Daddy,\\
331 - this is the fellow I was telling you about.\\
332 - How do you do?\\
333 - Wing Commander Edward Hyde-Tottingham, R.A.F. retired.\\
334 - This is my wife Sharon.\\
335 - Hello.\\
336 - Nice to meet you.\\
337 - Let me ask you something, Shary.\\
338 - Would you have raised your daughter\\
339 - with a jungle beast in an effort\\
340 - to satisfy your scientific curiosity?\\
341 - Well... I really couldn't say.\\
342 - I have cross-bred orchids.\\
343 - Yes. They're lovely.\\
344 - As are you, my darling.\\
345 - Walden, I don't understand.\\
346 - Did something happen with your mother?\\
347 - Oh, yeah, something happened.\\
348 - My entire life is a lie.\\
349 - You know why I try so hard to please you sexually?\\
350 - Because\\
351 - I'm afraid if I don't give you multiple orgasms,\\
352 - that you'll banish me to Central Africa.\\
353 - What?!\\
354 - The Commander and I have often traveled to Africa on safari.\\
355 - Is that so?\\
356 - Oh, yes.\\
357 - Though I can't say I've ever had multiple orgasms.\\
358 - Lucky if I get the one.\\
359 -     Men.    \\
360 - Come on, Walden, call me back.\\
361 - I'm worried sick.\\
362 - He always disappears like this when he's upset.\\
363 - As a child, he'd climb into a tree to sulk,\\
364 - and when I'd try to get him down,\\
365 - he'd beat his chest and bellow at me.\\
366 - Remind you of anybody?\\
367 - Yeah. His father.\\
368 - Hello?\\
369 - Oh, uh, hi, Zoey.\\
370 - Walden's not here.\\
371 - Really?\\
372 - Okay, well, well, thanks for letting me know.\\
373 - What's going on?\\
374 - Apparently, your son got drunk\\
375 - and climbed up onto his girlfriend's roof.\\
376 - He, what?\\
377 - Still early. We could catch a movie.\\
378 - Are you out of your mind? We have to go get him.\\
379 - Oh, oh, absolutely, sure. I was just about to suggest that.\\
380 - Are you on Facebook?\\
381 - Maybe I could give you a poke sometime.\\
382 -     Men.    \\
383 - Uh... Walden?\\
384 - What are you doing here?\\
385 - Well... to be perfectly honest,\\
386 - I'm trying to impress your mother.\\
387 - Why? She used me as a guinea pig.\\
388 - Yeah, well, my mother once left me\\
389 - at summer camp till Thanksgiving.\\
390 - So?\\
391 - So, we can't keep blaming our parents\\
392 - for how our lives turned out.\\
393 - Oh! Oh!\\
394 - Be careful. If you fall, you'll die.\\
395 - Thank you.\\
396 - Did you forgive your mother?\\
397 - No, never,\\
398 - but I'm a small, petty man.\\
399 - You, however, have accomplished great things\\
400 - and have the capacity to accomplish even more.\\
401 - What about Magilla?\\
402 - I loved him, and she just sent him away.\\
403 - Yeah. That's rough.\\
404 - But I know what it's like to lose a brother.\\
405 - Who, by the way, also tried to kill a Jehovah's Witness.\\
406 - He was hung over,\\
407 - and they just kept ringing that damn doorbell.\\
408 - This is the LAPD.\\
409 - Please get off of the roof!\\
410 - Go away! Leave me alone!\\
411 - Don't wave your arms at the aircraft.\\
412 - That never ends well.\\
413 - Get out of here!\\
414 - It's all right!\\
415 - It's just a mother issue!\\
416 - Walden, you come down from there right now!\\
417 - Oh, excuse me?\\
418 - Are you Walden's mum?\\
419 - Yes. Are-Are you Zoey?\\
420 - - I am. - It's so nice to meet you.\\
421 - Likewise. These are my parents.\\
422 - Wing Commander Edward Hyde-Tottingham.\\
423 - This is my wife Sharon.\\
424 - Lovely to meet you.\\
425 - Your son's a charming young man.\\
426 - Yes, charming.\\
427 - Thank you.\\
428 - Thinks he's the brother of a monkey.\\
429 - What's all that about?\\
430 - I think that's my dad up there.\\
431 - I think you're right.\\
432 - Want to get some frozen yogurt?\\
433 - Totally.\\
434 -     Men.    \\
435 -     Men.    \\
436 - Walden, I hope you understand, honey,\\
437 - I never meant to hurt you.\\
438 - I know.\\
439 - This is the best Christmas gift ever.\\
440 - Oh, I'm so glad.\\
441 - See you in a few.\\
442 - You really are a terrific mom.\\
443 - Oh, thanks.\\
444 - And woman.\\
445 - Give it a rest, Alan.\\
446 - Magilla?\\
447 - That's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.\\
448 - Yeah.\\
449 - What's the Taser for?\\
450 - That's a 400-pound gorilla.\\
451 - This really could have gone either way.\\

11 - You're terrible.\\
12 - Open it.\\
13 - Dare I say it? Key to your heart?\\
14 - Better. It's a key to my house.\\
15 - Walden, I can't accept a key to your house.\\
16 - It's a bit premature.\\
17 - Well, if anything in our relationship's going to be premature,\\
18 - I prefer it to be the house key.\\
19 - It's a very sweet gesture.\\
20 - Mistletoe.\\

33 - Brown. the left one's got a little fleck of green in it.\\
34 - Damn.\\

144 - That's it.\\
145 - Tomorrow I start moisturizing.\\
146 - - Mom. - Baby.\\
147 - Eyeball, eyeball.\\
148 - Nose and mouth.\\
149 - I love you north.\\
150 - I love you south.\\
151 - Hey, Alan, meet my mother Robin.\\
152 - Nice to meet you, Alan.\\
153 - Likewise.\\
154 - Mom, let me show you my place.\\
155 - Check it out, I got my own ocean.\\
156 - Well, it's not completely mine.\\
157 - I have to share the other side with Japan.\\
158 - It's very nice, dear.\\
159 - Yeah, I'm rich.\\
160 - Well... I know what I want for Christmas.\\
161 -     Men.    \\
162 - So how long have you two been living together?\\
163 - A couple of months.\\
164 - I see.\\
165 - I'm sorry, I-I have to ask.\\
166 - Is this the woman you don't want me to meet?\\
167 - What?\\
168 - No.\\
169 - No, Alan is just a friend.\\
170 - Tell her.\\
171 - Butch and Sundance, not Brokeback Mountain.\\
172 - Okay, sorry.\\
173 - I-I mean, you have to admit, it's a rather strange set-up--\\
174 - a 33-year-old man living with a 60-year-old.\\
175 - I'm 44.\\
176 - Right, me, too.\\
177 - Alan helped me through my break-up with Bridget,\\
178 - and then he needed a place to stay,\\
179 - so I asked him to stick around.\\
180 - Oh, that is so like you.\\
181 - When Walden was a little boy,\\
182 - he used to bring home sick, helpless animals all the time.\\
183 - God help me, I can't take that as an insult.\\
184 - So, uh, what do you do, Robin?\\
185 - I'm a primatologist.\\
186 - I, I work mainly with gorillas.\\
187 - Oh, oh, so I guess that makes you the gorilla my dreams.\\
188 - It was hysterical when Bugs Bunny did it.\\
189 - And thanks to the financial support\\
190 - of my brilliant son, I have a private\\
191 - gorilla sanctuary in Temecula.\\
192 - Oh, no kidding?\\
193 - Yeah, we take gorillas\\
194 - who were born in captivity\\
195 - and those who have lost their wild habitats\\
196 - and provide them with a safe, stable,\\
197 - loving family environment.\\
198 - Oh, that sounds wonderful.\\
199 - Does one have to be a gorilla to apply for admittance?\\
200 - I'm afraid so.\\
201 - Story of my life.\\
202 - When I was little, I always wanted\\
203 - to play with the gorillas.\\
204 - I even made up my own imaginary gorilla friend.\\
205 - Remember Magilla, Mom?\\
206 - Hmm, yeah, but he wasn't imaginary.\\
207 - What?\\
208 - Walden, Magilla lived with us\\
209 - for the first four years of your life.\\
210 - He was real?\\
211 - Yeah.\\
212 - Do you want to see some pictures?\\
213 - Wait, w-w-wait, Magilla was real?\\
214 - Very much so.\\
215 - Wait, you actually had a gorilla living with you?\\
216 - Yep, I was doing experiments to see if gorillas could learn\\
217 - as fast as human children, so\\
218 - I raised Magilla and Walden together from birth.\\
219 - Wow.\\
220 - All we had was a schnauzer and an Argentinean tennis pro.\\
221 - Uncle Javier.\\
222 - The tennis pro, not the schnauzer.\\
223 - Hold on a second, I was raised with a gorilla?\\
224 - Oh, well, just until you started preschool.\\
225 - Now, look, here's you and Magilla together in your crib.\\
226 - And here's\\
227 - the two of you at your first birthday.\\
228 - Wait a minute,\\
229 - is that how I learned sign language?\\
230 - I'm sorry, I don't have any bananas.\\
231 - Look, there's the two of you\\
232 - on the playground.\\
233 - Oh, your first Halloween.\\
234 - You went as a gorilla,\\
235 - and Magilla went as a ghost.\\
236 - Whoa, whoa.\\
237 - Yeah, okay. Yeah, it's starting to come back to me.\\
238 - Like, riding tricycles together,\\
239 - and running... running around the house.\\
240 - Or playing hide in the closet.\\
241 - Wait. Why were we always hiding in the closet?\\
242 - Well, the Homeowners Association didn't allow cats or dogs.\\
243 - What would they have said about a gorilla?\\
244 - Yeah. I remember.\\
245 - You told me he was my brother.\\
246 - Well, in a sense, he was.\\
247 - And then one day, he was gone.\\
248 - Yeah.\\
249 - You said he got sent back to the jungle.\\
250 - Well, sweetheart, we didn't have any choice.\\
251 - He was getting too big. He, uh...\\
252 - He tried to kill a Jehovah's Witness.\\
253 - Now, Now, to be fair, who among us hasn't...\\
254 - Not now, Alan.\\
255 - This is really starting to freak me out.\\
256 - Well, sweetie, I-I don't understand\\
257 - why you're making such a big deal out of this.\\
258 - You're kidding, right?\\
259 - I-I just discovered that my brother is a gorilla!\\
260 - That's-That's kind of a big deal!\\
261 - Hey, my brother was a pig, so, I mean...\\
262 - I said, not now, Alan!\\
263 - Walden, calm down.\\
264 - You do realize that I spent my entire childhood\\
265 - worrying that if I misbehaved,\\
266 - I would get sent away to the jungle like Magilla!\\
267 - One false move, Zimbabwe!\\
268 - Well, sweetheart, I...\\
269 - I never knew that you felt like that.\\
270 - Of course you didn't.\\
271 - You were so busy doing your experiment!\\
272 - Walden!\\
273 - Kids, huh?\\
274 - So, you seeing anybody?\\
275 -     Men.    \\
276 -     Men.    \\
277 - Walden, it's Mom. Where are you?\\
278 - Please call me back so we can talk about this.\\
279 - I had no idea he'd repressed all those childhood memories.\\
280 - Well, apparently,\\
281 - losing what he thought was his sibling was very traumatic.\\
282 - I'm wondering if maybe I have to rethink his Christmas gift.\\
283 - Why? What did you get him?\\
284 - A bathrobe.\\
285 - Yeah, not a good idea.\\
286 - And I can't even return it.\\
287 - It's slightly irregular.\\
288 - You must think I'm a terrible mother.\\
289 - Well, let's compare mothering techniques.\\
290 - Um, did you tell him that Disneyland burned down\\
291 - to avoid having to take him there\\
292 - for his sixth, seventh and eighth birthdays?\\
293 - No.\\
294 - Did you tell him to walk it off\\
295 - after his appendix burst?\\
296 - No.\\
297 - Did you tell me the only reason you got pregnant\\
298 - was because you didn't want to smear your lipstick?\\
299 - Of course not!\\
300 - Then, far as I'm concerned,\\
301 - you're Mother of the Freakin' Year. Hmm.\\
302 - Mm. Although I did store Walden's embryo\\
303 - in a cryogenic chamber until Magilla's mother got pregnant\\
304 - so they could be born at the same time.\\
305 - Okay, flag on the play.\\
306 - You did what?\\
307 - I needed my child and the gorilla\\
308 - to be born at the same time for the experiment to be valid.\\
309 - And your husband was okay with this?\\
310 - It was for science.\\
311 - And I may not have told him.\\
312 - Okay, well, well, after all that time and energy,\\
313 - what did you learn?\\
314 - My son is smarter than a gorilla.\\
315 - Mine's not.\\
316 -     Men.    \\
317 - Oh, Walden, what are you doing here?\\
318 - My brother is a gorilla, and she sent him away.\\
319 - I'm sorry. Is that some sort of American Christmas Carol?\\
320 - No. It's a succinct summation\\
321 - of my seminal years with a simian sibling.\\
322 - Are you drunk?\\
323 - I ought to be. I've taken the necessary steps.\\
324 - Sweetie, this isn't a very good time.\\
325 - You're telling me.\\
326 - My mother is a mad scientist,\\
327 - and I spent the first four years of my life\\
328 - flinging poop with my brother... the gorilla.\\
329 - Hello!\\
330 - Mummy and Daddy,\\
331 - this is the fellow I was telling you about.\\
332 - How do you do?\\
333 - Wing Commander Edward Hyde-Tottingham, R.A.F. retired.\\
334 - This is my wife Sharon.\\
335 - Hello.\\
336 - Nice to meet you.\\
337 - Let me ask you something, Shary.\\
338 - Would you have raised your daughter\\
339 - with a jungle beast in an effort\\
340 - to satisfy your scientific curiosity?\\
341 - Well... I really couldn't say.\\
342 - I have cross-bred orchids.\\
343 - Yes. They're lovely.\\
344 - As are you, my darling.\\
345 - Walden, I don't understand.\\
346 - Did something happen with your mother?\\
347 - Oh, yeah, something happened.\\
348 - My entire life is a lie.\\
349 - You know why I try so hard to please you sexually?\\
350 - Because\\
351 - I'm afraid if I don't give you multiple orgasms,\\
352 - that you'll banish me to Central Africa.\\
353 - What?!\\
354 - The Commander and I have often traveled to Africa on safari.\\
355 - Is that so?\\
356 - Oh, yes.\\
357 - Though I can't say I've ever had multiple orgasms.\\
358 - Lucky if I get the one.\\
359 -     Men.    \\
360 - Come on, Walden, call me back.\\
361 - I'm worried sick.\\
362 - He always disappears like this when he's upset.\\
363 - As a child, he'd climb into a tree to sulk,\\
364 - and when I'd try to get him down,\\
365 - he'd beat his chest and bellow at me.\\
366 - Remind you of anybody?\\
367 - Yeah. His father.\\
368 - Hello?\\
369 - Oh, uh, hi, Zoey.\\
370 - Walden's not here.\\
371 - Really?\\
372 - Okay, well, well, thanks for letting me know.\\
373 - What's going on?\\
374 - Apparently, your son got drunk\\
375 - and climbed up onto his girlfriend's roof.\\
376 - He, what?\\
377 - Still early. We could catch a movie.\\
378 - Are you out of your mind? We have to go get him.\\
379 - Oh, oh, absolutely, sure. I was just about to suggest that.\\
380 - Are you on Facebook?\\
381 - Maybe I could give you a poke sometime.\\
382 -     Men.    \\
383 - Uh... Walden?\\
384 - What are you doing here?\\
385 - Well... to be perfectly honest,\\
386 - I'm trying to impress your mother.\\
387 - Why? She used me as a guinea pig.\\
388 - Yeah, well, my mother once left me\\
389 - at summer camp till Thanksgiving.\\
390 - So?\\
391 - So, we can't keep blaming our parents\\
392 - for how our lives turned out.\\
393 - Oh! Oh!\\
394 - Be careful. If you fall, you'll die.\\
395 - Thank you.\\
396 - Did you forgive your mother?\\
397 - No, never,\\
398 - but I'm a small, petty man.\\
399 - You, however, have accomplished great things\\
400 - and have the capacity to accomplish even more.\\
401 - What about Magilla?\\
402 - I loved him, and she just sent him away.\\
403 - Yeah. That's rough.\\
404 - But I know what it's like to lose a brother.\\
405 - Who, by the way, also tried to kill a Jehovah's Witness.\\
406 - He was hung over,\\
407 - and they just kept ringing that damn doorbell.\\
408 - This is the LAPD.\\
409 - Please get off of the roof!\\
410 - Go away! Leave me alone!\\
411 - Don't wave your arms at the aircraft.\\
412 - That never ends well.\\
413 - Get out of here!\\
414 - It's all right!\\
415 - It's just a mother issue!\\
416 - Walden, you come down from there right now!\\
417 - Oh, excuse me?\\
418 - Are you Walden's mum?\\
419 - Yes. Are-Are you Zoey?\\
420 - - I am. - It's so nice to meet you.\\
421 - Likewise. These are my parents.\\
422 - Wing Commander Edward Hyde-Tottingham.\\
423 - This is my wife Sharon.\\
424 - Lovely to meet you.\\
425 - Your son's a charming young man.\\
426 - Yes, charming.\\
427 - Thank you.\\
428 - Thinks he's the brother of a monkey.\\
429 - What's all that about?\\
430 - I think that's my dad up there.\\
431 - I think you're right.\\
432 - Want to get some frozen yogurt?\\
433 - Totally.\\
434 -     Men.    \\
435 -     Men.    \\
436 - Walden, I hope you understand, honey,\\
437 - I never meant to hurt you.\\
438 - I know.\\
439 - This is the best Christmas gift ever.\\
440 - Oh, I'm so glad.\\
441 - See you in a few.\\
442 - You really are a terrific mom.\\
443 - Oh, thanks.\\
444 - And woman.\\
445 - Give it a rest, Alan.\\
446 - Magilla?\\
447 - That's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.\\
448 - Yeah.\\
449 - What's the Taser for?\\
450 - That's a 400-pound gorilla.\\
451 - This really could have gone either way.\\

\subsection {Episode 14: A Possum on Chemo}
1 - Walden, are you almost ready?\\
2 - Almost.\\
3 - How is it possible that I am always ready before you are?\\
4 - Hey, it takes a lot of work\\
5 - to make it look like I don't care how I look.\\
6 - Please, let's go. I'm starving.\\
7 - Just give me a minute. I'm having a bad beard day.\\
8 - Is there such a thing as a good beard day?\\
9 - Absolutely.\\
10 - Usually I wake up, and it's all soft and fluffy,\\
11 - but I must have slept on it wrong,\\
12 - 'cause this side's, like, flat and listless.\\
13 - Oh, if it's causing you such problems,\\
14 - why don't you just shave it off?\\
15 - I thought you loved my beard.\\
16 - No, I never said that.\\
17 - Then why'd you go out with me in the first place?\\
18 - I don't judge a person by what's on the surface.\\
19 - Yeah, but yet you're asking me to shave my surface.\\
20 - Yes, please.\\
21 - Wow.\\
22 - I mean, is there anything else\\
23 - about me that's not working for you?\\
24 - As long as you ask,\\
25 - I'm not crazy about the Jennifer Aniston hairdo.\\
26 - Okay. This is...\\
27 - I'm-I'm... I'm a little... I'm a little confused here.\\
28 - I thought you liked the way I looked.\\
29 - Oh, I do. I do.\\
30 - I just think I'd like it better if the ratio of hair to face\\
31 - was more on the face side of things.\\
32 - Well, I will definitely give it some thought.\\
33 - Oh. I don't want you to do anything you don't want to do.\\
34 - Although, to be fair, I did remove some hair for you.\\
35 - After I almost choked to death.\\
36 - Okay, just need to post a profile picture,\\
37 - and let the dating begin.\\
38 - Whoa.\\
39 - To Catch a Predator.\\
40 - Hello, sailor!\\
41 - Wow. More chins than a Chinese phone book.\\
42 - Hey. We're heading out.\\
43 - Have a nice dinner.\\
44 - What are you going to do tonight?\\
45 - Well, I don't want to jinx myself,\\
46 - but I'm hoping to rub one out and be asleep by 10:00.\\
47 - Rub one out?\\
48 - Oh, he's gonna wait till we leave,\\
49 - watch some porn and masturbate.\\
50 - Ah.\\
51 - Oh. Ick.\\
52 - You know what?\\
53 - Don't just hang out here alone.\\
54 - Why don't you just join us for dinner?\\
55 - Oh, no, no, no. I don't want to be a third wheel.\\
56 - You two kids have a great time.\\
57 - Thank you. No.\\
58 - We insist.\\
59 - Tell him, Zoey.\\
60 - Do join us, won't you?\\
61 - Great.\\
62 - Rain check. Where we eating?\\
63 - I was thinking about trying out that new Italian place on PCH.\\
64 - Ooh, really? Italian? That's kind of heavy.\\
65 - What are you in the mood for?\\
66 - Oh, no, no. It's your night. I'm just tagging along.\\
67 - I was rather looking forward to Italian, so...\\
68 - Well, you heard her. The queen wants pasta.\\

94 - that men look much more attractive\\
95 - when they're properly groomed.\\
96 - Really?\\
97 - I've always been properly groomed,\\

110 - Oh, I don't know. I mean, as much as I'd like to see her,\\
111 - I'm not sure she still wants to see me.\\
112 - Uh, it didn't end well.\\
113 - What happened?\\
114 - Did she catch you rubbing one out?\\
115 - - Did I say that right? - That was perfect.\\
116 - Yeah? Okay.\\
117 - Just go say hello to her.\\
118 - Well, guess it couldn't hurt.\\
119 - I mean, she does look a little pathetic\\
120 - just sitting there all by herself\\
121 - waiting to get hit on by some loser.\\
122 - By all means, save her from that.\\
123 - All right, wish me luck.\\
124 - Good luck.\\
125 - Go get 'em.\\
126 - Seriously, what's wrong with her?\\
127 - Hey, stranger.\\

129 - Hi! How have you been?\\
130 - Uh, good. Good. You?\\
131 - Real good.\\
132 - Well, you look beautiful.\\
133 - Thank you.\\
134 - Yeah, I've been working out.\\
135 - Good.\\
136 - Good, good. So, uh, what are you doing here all by yourself?\\
137 - - Oh, well... - Sorry.\\
138 - I don't think that valet has ever driven a Ferrari before.\\
139 - Alan, this is my friend Dylan.\\
140 - Dylan, this is Alan.\\
141 - - Oh, hey. - Hey, Alan.\\
142 - Uh, Dylan, huh?\\
143 - Uh, named after Bob?\\
144 - No, named after my dad.\\
145 - He was named after Bob.\\
146 - Okay. Okay.\\
147 - Uh, well, it was nice to meet you.\\
148 - Uh, Lyndsey, it's always great to see you.\\
149 - Um, I-I should get back to my date.\\
150 - Yeah, Walden's trying to set me up with his baby sister.\\
151 - She's very pretty.\\
152 - Oh, yeah, she's okay.\\
153 - Uh, it's a very close family.\\
154 - Seems overly complicated.\\
155 - What?\\
156 - Why don't they just make chips with the dip already on 'em?\\
157 - Dude.\\
158 - Dude...\\
159 - that's a million-dollar idea.\\
160 - What is?\\
161 - Pre-dipped chips.\\
162 - See, that's a million-dollar idea.\\
163 - What's a million-dollar idea?\\
164 - It's an idea worth a million dollars.\\
165 - Boy, I wish I had one of those.\\
166 - I can't believe they brought back Beavis and Butt-Head.\\
167 - Yeah. Those guys are, like, too stupid to live.\\
168 - Uh-oh. That's my dad.\\
169 - Quick, give me that air freshener.\\
170 - This is bug spray, dude.\\
171 - Says it's for roaches.\\
172 - Perfect.\\
173 - Just forget about her, Alan.\\
174 - I'm sure Zoey has some single friends she can fix you up with.\\
175 - No, I don't. Sorry.\\
176 - I just can't get over how young the guy is.\\
177 - Well, a clean-shaven face will do that for a man.\\
178 - Well, thanks again for dinner.\\
179 - I really thought I was gonna eat both lobsters.\\
180 - You really don't have any single friends?\\
181 - Shh. Just keep walking.\\
182 - Hey.\\
183 - Hey. Hey.\\
184 - Oh, my God!\\
185 - Is that bug spray?\\
186 - Yeah, we were just getting rid of some roaches.\\
187 - Maybe we need to call an exterminator.\\
188 - I think we need to call Domino's.\\
189 - Mind if I hang out with you guys?\\
190 - Sure.\\
191 - Who's dumber than Beavis and Butt-Head?\\
192 - Oh, hey, Eldridge, I ran into your mom tonight.\\
193 - Really? Was she with Dylan?\\
194 - Yeah, yeah. Have you met him?\\
195 - What's he like? Is it serious?\\
196 - I doubt it. He's gay.\\
197 - What? He's gay?\\
198 - Oh, yeah, big poof.\\
199 - Always hugging me a little too long.\\
200 - Wait. Are we talking about the guy with the Ferrari?\\
201 - Yeah. Dylan.\\
202 - I once saw him wearing my mom's underwear.\\
203 - Oh, well, that doesn't mean he's gay. He...\\
204 - He might just like pretty things.\\
205 - Um, does your mom ever mention me?\\
206 - Yeah.\\
207 - Yeah, all the time. She really misses you.\\
208 - You should stop by some time.\\
209 - Huh.\\
210 - Well, it's not too late.\\
211 - Maybe I'll wander over there and carpe me some diem.\\
212 - Way to get rid of him.\\
213 - Thanks.\\
214 - Was any of it true?\\
215 - Not a word.\\
216 - What does "carpe me some diem" mean?\\
217 - It's French for "bang your mom."\\
218 -     Men.\\
219 - Mmm. Mmm. Hang on.\\
220 - Beard.\\
221 - Oh, please.\\
222 - I know what you're trying to do.\\
223 - What?\\
224 - Do you really hate my beard that much?\\
225 - "Hate" is a very strong word.\\
226 - But, yeah, I hate it.\\
227 - Okay, I don't understand.\\
228 - We've been going out for a couple months.\\
229 - Why is it all of a sudden the problem?\\
230 - All right.\\
231 - This is probably going to sound very shallow,\\
232 - but there's a cocktail party at my office this weekend,\\
233 - and since I'm on the fast track to make partner,\\
234 - I'd rather not show up with Hipster Jesus.\\
235 - You're right, that did sound shallow.\\
236 - I'm sorry.\\
237 - But if it's that important to you\\
238 - and the people you work with-- who obviously have never heard\\
239 - of Steve Wozniak, Richard Branson\\
240 - or freakin' Santa Claus...\\
241 - I'll do it.\\
242 - Really?\\
243 - Yes, really.\\
244 - And you'll cut the hair, too?\\
245 - Aw, man!\\
246 - Fine.\\
247 - Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.\\
248 - Now, what can I do to make you happy?\\
249 - Well...\\
250 - Besides that. Aw.\\
251 - Oh, Dylan!\\
252 - Oh, yes, Dylan!\\
253 - Oh! Yes!\\
254 - Dylan! Yes!\\
255 - Dylan!\\
256 - Big poof, my ass.\\
257 - Yes! Yes! Yes!\\
258 - Yes! Yes! I hate that kid.\\
259 - Yes, Dylan! Yes!\\
260 -     Men.\\
261 - So why'd you quit being a hairdresser?\\
262 - They shut down the prison.\\
263 - You were in prison?\\
264 - No, I was a prison barber.\\
265 - Which, to be honest, was mostly about lice control\\
266 - and trading sex for cigarettes.\\
267 - What's going on?\\
268 - I'm getting cleaned up for Zoey's office party.\\
269 - Wow. So you finally caved.\\
270 - I did not cave.\\
271 - Just want to make her happy.\\
272 - Oh, yeah, I get it.\\
273 - I've spent my whole life\\
274 - doing what I'm told to make women happy.\\
275 - No, Zoey didn't order me to shave or cut my hair.\\
276 - It's my choice.\\
277 - Yeah, and when I was married to Judith,\\
278 - it was my choice to get a vasectomy, a new kitchen\\
279 - and a Labradoodle with diarrhea.\\
280 - Ooh.\\
281 - Excuse me.\\
282 - Hey, Lyndsey.\\
283 - All right, Samson, what do you want?\\
284 - Look pretty for your cell mate or the death row special?\\
285 - Yeah, yeah, it was good to see you, too.\\
286 - W-What?\\
287 - Yeah, I-I would love to-to get together.\\
288 - Uh, tomorrow night?\\
289 - Great, I-I'll see you then.\\
290 - Huh.\\
291 - She's dating a young, good-looking stud with money.\\
292 - Why would she want to see me?\\
293 - Maybe she needs a kidney.\\
294 -     Men.\\
295 - Surprise.\\
296 - Walden, you promised.\\
297 - I know. I'm sorry.\\
298 - I just, I couldn't do it.\\
299 - Then why did you tell me you would?\\
300 - Because I wanted you to stop nagging me.\\
301 - Are you calling me a nag?\\
302 - No, I did not say that.\\
303 - I said you were nagging.\\
304 - What's the difference?\\
305 - Obviously the "ging."\\
306 - Walden, you gave me your word.\\
307 - I-I was gonna go through with it, and then I realized\\
308 - this is who I am, and if you don't like me for who I am,\\
309 - then what's the point?\\
310 - The point is you lied to me!\\
311 - N-No, it wasn't a lie.\\
312 - I meant it when I said it.\\
313 - But you said it to stop me "nagging!"\\
314 - That's right.\\
315 - No, that's wrong!\\
316 - No, what you were trying to make me do-- that's wrong.\\
317 - Now, are we going to your stupid office party or what?\\
318 - Okay, so I guess you're going with the "or what!"\\
319 - You know what, thank you for showing me your true colors\\
320 - before I fell hopelessly in love with you!\\
321 - Uh-oh.\\
322 - Excuse me?\\
323 -     Men.\\
324 - I have missed you so much.\\
325 - I missed you, too.\\
326 - Uh, maybe this is the wrong time to ask this,\\
327 - but don't you have a boyfriend?\\
328 - We broke up.\\
329 - So you left Dylan for me?\\
330 - Don't be silly.\\
331 - Wait, wait.\\
332 - So-So he left you?\\
333 - No.\\
334 - O-Okay, I'm confused.\\
335 - Do you really want to know?\\
336 - Actually, I think I'm good.\\
337 - Do you have any idea how exhausting it is\\
338 - going out with a gorgeous 25-year-old man?\\
339 - If I said "yes," this would be a whole different conversation.\\
340 - Let me give you an example.\\
341 - Every morning, I had to get up an hour before him\\
342 - to put on makeup so he wouldn't open his eyes\\
343 - and think he just nailed his mom.\\
344 - Nobody wants that.\\
345 - And that's not the worst part.\\
346 - A man his age wants to have sex constantly.\\
347 - And that's a problem?\\
348 - After a certain point, yes.\\
349 - There's not enough cranberry juice in the world\\
350 - to put out the fire that's burning between my legs.\\
351 - Um...\\
352 - Well, the fire between my legs just went out.\\
353 - I mean, the entire time I was with him,\\
354 - I walked out of the bedroom backwards\\
355 - so he wouldn't see my ass.\\
356 - What's wrong with your ass?\\
357 - Oh, Alan.\\
358 - That's why I've missed you so much.\\
359 - I-I don't get it.\\
360 - Your standards are so much lower than Dylan's.\\
361 - I don't have to worry about disappointing you.\\
362 - I do set a low bar.\\
363 - Or worry about you leaving me for a younger woman.\\
364 - - Why not? - You can't get one.\\
365 - And you want to know the best part?\\
366 - It gets better?\\
367 - I could sit here and fart like a buffalo,\\
368 - and you'd still want to be with me.\\
369 - Well, with age comes wisdom.\\
370 - A fella learns to breathe through his mouth.\\
371 - Come here, you.\\
372 - You're testing me, aren't you?\\
373 - I am.\\
374 - Hang on.\\
375 - Whew! That's a dead buffalo.\\
376 - - Oh, hey, Zoey. - Hi, Alan.\\
377 - Is Walden here?\\
378 - Uh, you know, I'm not sure.\\
379 - I haven't seen him all day.\\
380 - Uh, Walden, you up there?!\\
381 - Coming!\\
382 - Uh, oh, Lyndsey, Zoey.\\
383 - Zoey, Lyndsey. Hi.\\
384 - Hi.\\
385 - We just got back together.\\
386 - Really?\\
387 - Oh, did that lovely boy die?\\
388 - Zoey?\\
389 - Hmm?\\
390 - Oh, my God.\\
391 - Look at you.\\
392 - You like it?\\
393 - Like it?\\
394 - I'm tempted to rub one out.\\
395 - But why?\\
396 - Well, it turns out, when you weren't nagging me to do it,\\
397 - I wanted to.\\
398 - What are you doing here?\\
399 - I came to apologize for nagging.\\
400 - I had no right to try and change you.\\
401 - Thank you.\\
402 - I also hoped you might elaborate\\
403 - on that "falling in love" comment.\\
404 - I don't know what you're talking about.\\
405 - All right then, come with me.\\
406 - Where are we going?\\
407 - I want to test drive this new face of yours.\\
408 - Oh.\\
409 - Hop on!\\
410 - That poor girl.\\
411 - Yeah, he looks younger and prettier than before.\\
412 - She's gonna have to hold in her farts till the Fourth of July.\\
413 - Mm-hmm.\\
414 -     Men.\\
415 - Here's your cranberry juice.\\
416 - Thank you.\\
417 - So, uh, how will you know\\
418 - when your lady problems have cleared up?\\
419 - I'll be able to pee without screaming.\\
420 - Thanks so much for letting me use your loo.\\
421 - Oh, any time.\\
422 - I know it's silly, but I just don't want Walden\\
423 - to hear any of my bathroom noises.\\
424 - I totally understand.\\
425 - Thank you. Night.\\
426 - Good night.\\
427 - Dylan took me to Hawaii for a week, I didn't crap once.\\
428 - Is that so?\\
429 - Thank God he fell asleep on the flight back.\\
430 - Why's that?\\
431 - Gave me a chance to unload.\\
432 - I put the first-class lavatory totally out of commission.\\
433 - Really? Yeah.\\
434 - Stewardess thought it was a terrorist attack.\\
435 - All right, good night.\\
436 - Yeah, o-okay.\\
437 - Good night.\\
438 - They don't have what we have.\\
439 - No, they don't.\\

\subsection {Episode 15: The Duchess of Dull-In-Sack}
1 -     Men    \\
2 - Oh, God.\\
3 - Walden.\\
4 - Wake up. You have to go.\\
5 - What?\\
6 - My daughter's going to be up soon.\\
7 - I don't want her to find you in here.\\
8 - Okay...\\
9 - I'm awake.\\
10 - Now get dressed.\\
11 - All right.\\
12 - Um... before I go,\\
13 - I do have that morning phenomenon\\
14 - that sometimes happens to fellas.\\
15 - You know, in the morning.\\
16 - I don't care about your erection, okay?\\
17 - Okay, fine, fine.\\
18 - I just thought that I would point it out\\
19 - since it is...\\
20 - you know, pointing out.\\
21 - Very impressive.\\
22 - Now, skedaddle before Ava wakes up, okay?\\
23 - You know, at some point, I'm going to have to meet her.\\
24 - At some point, yes, but not today.\\
25 - Yeah, well, I kind of feel like I already know her.\\
26 - I mean, I'm certainly familiar\\
27 - with her port of entry into this world.\\
28 - Yes. Ha ha.\\
29 - Now, get out.\\
30 - Mummy?\\
31 - Uh... closet!\\
32 - Really? The closet? Isn't that kind of clich  ?\\
33 - Oh, God. In!\\
34 - I want to snuggle.\\
35 - Good idea!\\
36 - Let's snuggle in your room.\\
37 - No, here.\\
38 - Here. Of course.\\
39 - Um, good.\\
40 - Now, close your eyes,\\
41 - and Mummy will give you a super-duper snuggle.\\
42 - Mwah!\\
43 - Are your eyes closed?\\
44 - Uh-huh.\\
45 - Are Winston's eyes closed?\\
46 - He's not real, Mummy.\\
47 - All righty.\\
48 - Get out!\\
49 - All done.\\
50 - Now, what do you say\\
51 - we make some pancakes?\\
52 - Yay!\\
53 - Pancakes! Pancakes! Pancakes! Pancakes!\\
54 - Pancake train! Pancakes!\\
55 - - Pancakes! Pancakes! - Pancakes! Pancakes!\\
56 - I like pancakes.\\
57 - I left Winston on your bed.\\
58 - I could totally be Spider-Man.\\
59 - I think I broke my morning phenomenon.\\
60 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
61 -     Ah.     Men.\\
62 - <font color="#00FF00">    Two and a Half Men 9x15    </font> <font color="#00FFFF">The Duchess of Dull-in-Sack</font> Original Air Date on February 6, 2012\\
63 - == sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==\\
64 -     Men.\\
65 - Can I ask you a personal question?\\
66 - Does it involve money, drugs or pregnancy?\\
67 - No.\\
68 - How can I help you, my son?\\
69 - You and Eldridge's mom are dating again, right?\\
70 - Right. You think you'll ever get married?\\
71 - Uh, well, actually, we talked about that\\
72 - and decided the only reason to do it\\
73 - would be if we wanted to have more kids,\\
74 - and since we both...\\
75 - ...had so much success the first time,\\
76 - there's really no point.\\
77 - Oh.\\
78 - What brought that up?\\
79 - Oh. Me and Eldridge were thinking\\
80 - it would be cool if we were brothers,\\
81 - so that we could switch places to fool people.\\
82 - That only works if you're twins, Jake.\\
83 - How do you know for sure I'm Jake?\\
84 - Morning. Morning.\\
85 - What happened to you?\\
86 - I was perched on a dresser, and I fell on my penis.\\
87 - Oh. I hate when that happens.\\
88 - Uh... uh, dare I ask?\\
89 - Uh, yeah, I was hiding from Zoey's daughter.\\
90 - Oh. Still doesn't want you to meet her?\\
91 - No.\\
92 - Well, it's not unusual for single moms\\
93 - to be protective of their kids.\\
94 - And then, when you are introduced to them,\\
95 - you're "Uncle Alan, who's on his way back to Cleveland,\\
96 - "and you don't have to remember his name\\
97 - because you'll never, ever see him again."\\
98 - What do you do to women to piss them off so much?\\
99 - If I knew, don't you think I'd stop?\\
100 - Well, the daughter stuff\\
101 - isn't the only thing bothering me about Zoey.\\
102 - Oh, I thought you guys were getting along great.\\
103 - Well, we are... most of the time.\\
104 - It's just...\\
105 - Have you ever been in a relationship\\
106 - where you're really into each other,\\
107 - but the sex isn't everything it could be?\\
108 - Oh, sure.\\
109 - Uh, except for the "really into each other" part.\\
110 - It's not that the sex is bad, Mm-hmm.\\
111 - it's just that...\\
112 - lately, it seems like she could just take it or leave it.\\
113 - Oh... "Take it or leave it."\\
114 - Boy, I know that song.\\
115 - But my philosophy is,\\
116 - as long as she's taking it, I'm not leaving.\\
117 - You know what she said to me last night, after we had sex?\\
118 - "That was nice.\\
119 - Now let's do something fun."\\
120 - Well, I suppose that's better than,\\
121 - "Put your pants on so we can get back to the family reunion."\\
122 - You're kidding, right?\\
123 - Oh, she was just a cousin by marriage.\\
124 - So have you actually talked to Zoey about your problem?\\
125 - No. I was just hoping it would just get better.\\
126 - Oh, no, no, no. Take it from me.\\
127 - There are two things in long-term relationships\\
128 - that never get better by themselves.\\
129 - One is sex.\\
130 - What's the other one?\\
131 - Does it matter?\\
132 - It's all arranged.\\
133 - Ava's going to be spending tonight with her dad.\\
134 - Great.\\
135 - So sleepover at my house?\\
136 - Sounds heavenly.\\
137 - Although I don't know how much sleeping we'll do.\\
138 - Cheeky monkey.\\
139 - Shall I bring around some Chinese?\\
140 - Hey, the more, the merrier.\\
141 - Ha, ha.\\
142 - You know, if there's anything I can do\\
143 - to, you know, make you happier...\\
144 - What on Earth are you talking about?\\
145 - I just... I couldn't help but notice...\\
146 - I can't even say it.\\
147 - Come on, Walden.\\
148 - You can tell me anything.\\
149 - All right.\\
150 - The sex.\\
151 - You don't... you don't seem to be enjoying the sex.\\
152 - Okay, I can't talk about that.\\
153 - Okay, y-you said we could talk about anything.\\
154 - Yeah, but not about that.\\
155 - And certainly not on a computer.\\
156 - Why? Nobody's listening.\\
157 - I'm sorry.\\
158 - I'm-I'm very uncomfortable talking about...\\
159 - you know...\\
160 - No offense, but you don't seem\\
161 - that comfortable doing it, either.\\
162 - You're still talking about it.\\
163 - I-I-I mean, because if you're not,\\
164 - I mean, there are... there are things that we can do.\\
165 - There are things we can try.\\
166 - Like?\\
167 - I don't know, like role-playing.\\
168 - Role-playing?\\
169 - Yeah. You know...\\
170 - "Hey, lady, I'm here to clean the pool."\\
171 - But I don't have a pool.\\
172 - No, it's an imaginary pool.\\
173 - How is you cleaning an imaginary pool\\
174 - supposed to be erotic?\\
175 - Okay, okay, just forget the pool.\\
176 - I... all I'm saying is-is that,\\
177 - if there's anything I can do, just let me know.\\
178 - Thank you for your concern,\\
179 - but I'm perfectly satisfied with our...\\
180 - carnal interludes.\\
181 - Really?\\
182 - Carnal interludes?\\
183 - Well, what do you want me to call it?\\
184 - It doesn't matter. I mean, the distance\\
185 - between "carnal interludes" and what I would call it\\
186 - isn't really susceptible to compromise.\\
187 - All right, listen, I have to run and take Ava\\
188 - to her father's, so I'll see you tonight, yes?\\
189 - Great.\\
190 - Walden, believe me,\\
191 - I am fine and dandy with our...\\
192 - Carnal interludes.\\
193 - See you.\\
194 - Everything okay\\
195 - with you and Mary Poppins?\\
196 - Were you eavesdropping?\\
197 - If I don't eavesdrop,\\
198 - I've got nothing to tweet about.\\
199 - The problem is she's English.\\
200 - Stiff upper lips and all that.\\
201 - You should date a nice Polish girl.\\
202 - You don't say.\\
203 - Oh, yeah.\\
204 - Those Commies, they're all freaks.\\
205 - Sex is the only thing\\
206 - they didn't have to stand in line and wait for.\\
207 - Good to know.\\
208 - I think I'll stick with Zoey.\\
209 - I just wish I could get her to relax.\\
210 - You know, let go.\\
211 - Me, I'm just the opposite.\\
212 - I can get off leaning against the dryer\\
213 - with a couple of sneakers in it.\\
214 - Is that why my Nikes are so clean?\\
215 - Win-win.\\
216 - Listen, if you want to loosen up the Duchess of Dull-In-Sack,\\
217 - you might try slipping her one of my special brownies.\\
218 - I got a fresh batch in the fridge.\\
219 - You know, for my glaucoma.\\
220 - Thank you, but I'm...\\
221 - I don't want to have to get Zoey loaded to enjoy sex with me.\\
222 - Suit yourself.\\
223 - Doesn't want to get her loaded.\\
224 - What's the matter with kids today?\\
225 -     Men.\\
226 - Aw.\\
227 - That was a lovely movie.\\
228 - Yeah, that Hugh Grant is really something.\\
229 - Something wrong?\\
230 - No. Why?\\
231 - Usually, at this point in the evening,\\
232 - you start getting frisky.\\
233 - Frisky?\\
234 - Randy.\\
235 - Randy?\\
236 - All right. "Horny."\\
237 - Made you say it.\\
238 - Is that an invitation to get frisky?\\
239 - If you want.\\
240 - If you want.\\
241 - Well, I want if you want.\\
242 - No, no, I want you to want\\
243 - because you want, not because I want.\\
244 - Okay, I've lost the thread.\\
245 - Now, are we gonna do this or not?\\
246 - Only if you want.\\
247 - Oh, Walden, why are you making this so difficult?\\
248 - Because I... it's not fun for me unless you're having fun.\\
249 - All right.\\
250 - Let's have some fun.\\
251 - Oh, look.\\
252 - It's the pool cleaning man.\\
253 - Come to clean my pool, have you?\\
254 - Okay, that's... that's enough.\\
255 - My, what a big chlorine bottle you've got.\\
256 - O-Okay, please stop.\\
257 - Let's just stop.\\
258 - You sure?\\
259 - Yes.\\
260 - Oh, okay.\\
261 - We'll go to sleep, then.\\
262 - Do you like brownies?\\
263 - What?\\
264 - Is this another game?\\
265 - The sexy pastry chef.\\
266 - No. No.\\
267 - Come to butter my baking pan, have you?\\
268 - No. No.\\
269 - No. Uh... no.\\
270 - No. Okay.\\
271 - It's just that...\\
272 - Berta made these... pot brownies,\\
273 - and I just thought maybe,\\
274 - if we had one, that we could relax a little bit.\\
275 - Oh... Tried that once at university.\\
276 - Had a bit of a giggle.\\
277 - Is that a yes?\\
278 - I don't see any harm in it.\\
279 - What was that?\\
280 - Do you hear police sirens?\\
281 - I hear police sirens.\\
282 - Dear God, they're from France!\\
283 - Bummer.\\
284 - Oh, no, they're getting closer!\\
285 - Looks like someone else found the brownies.\\
286 - Oh, good, you saw her, too.\\
287 - Zoey!\\
288 - Zoey! Zoey!\\
289 - Okay, she's definitely not on the beach.\\
290 - Don't worry, man, I'm sure she's somewhere.\\
291 - That's true.\\
292 - Everybody's somewhere.\\
293 - Whoa, that is seriously deep.\\
294 - Slice?\\
295 - Ah, thank you.\\
296 - Okay.\\
297 - We got to find Zoey before something horrible happens.\\
298 - This is very good.\\
299 - Anyway, we should split up.\\
300 - A hundred bucks to the man who finds her.\\
301 - Hundred bucks?\\
302 - We're in.\\
303 - Cool.\\
304 - Maybe she's on the beach.\\
305 - Zoey! Zoey!\\
306 - Okay.\\
307 - We have to find Zoey before he does.\\
308 - Zoey!\\
309 - Where would you go if you were stoned and freaking out?\\
310 - Taco Bell.\\
311 - Excellent.\\
312 - Let's go. Zoey!\\
313 - I'm right behind you.\\
314 - Zoey! Zoey!\\
315 -     Men.\\
316 - Mmm...\\
317 - Hello.\\
318 - Mm, hello, Alan.\\
319 - What's going on?\\
320 - Just a little snack.\\
321 - I see.\\
322 - Uh, where's Walden?\\
323 - Beats me.\\
324 - Hey, you know what's very weird?\\
325 - You Americans call these chips, we call them crisps.\\
326 - And what we call chips, you call...\\
327 - French fries.\\
328 - Oh, don't get me started on the French.\\
329 - Yeah.\\
330 - Um, did you have one of Berta's brownies?\\
331 - Indeed I did.\\
332 - I did indeed.\\
333 - Indeed I did a doody-deedy.\\
334 - Hey,\\
335 - where's Walden?\\
336 - We're supposed to be having good sex.\\
337 - Oh, is that so?\\
338 - Mm.\\
339 - He thinks I don't enjoy it, but it's just hard for me\\
340 - to give myself to a man unless I trust him completely.\\
341 - I certainly understand that.\\
342 - But once I do, I have orgasm after orgasm,\\
343 - especially if you spank my bottom\\
344 - while I ride you like a Vespa.\\
345 - Okay. I'll-I'll try to pass that along.\\
346 - Um...\\
347 - Okay, I'm going to bed now.\\
348 - Night. Hmm. Mm.\\
349 - By the way, I know I haven't always\\
350 - been very warm to you.\\
351 - Well, that's true.\\
352 - It's only 'cause I don't care for you very much.\\
353 - Understood.\\
354 - Nighty-night.\\
355 - Good night.\\
356 - Nice change of pace hearing it with an accent.\\
357 - "I just don't care for you very much."\\
358 - It's classy.\\
359 - Oh, hey.\\
360 - Oh, hey, there you are.\\
361 - Zoey's looking for you.\\
362 - She's here?\\
363 - Yeah, she went to bed.\\
364 - Oh. Thank God.\\
365 - I better go check on her.\\
366 - But first, ice cream.\\
367 - Good news! We found Zoey!\\
368 -     Ta-da!\\
369 - Which one of you is the billionaire looking for me?\\
370 -     Men.\\
371 - I'm so sorry about last night.\\
372 - Don't be silly.\\
373 - I'm just glad you didn't end up in a French prison.\\
374 - I hope you don't think I'm a lost cause.\\
375 - No, no.\\
376 - I do like... you know.\\
377 - Glad to hear.\\
378 - Don't worry, I will not stop until I hear Paul Revere.\\
379 - I beg your pardon?\\
380 - You know, the British are coming!\\
381 - The British are coming!\\
382 - Hello.\\
383 - Nigel, what are you doing here?\\
384 - I had to bring Ava back early.\\
385 - Hello. Nigel Pierce.\\
386 - Walden Schmidt.\\
387 - Nigel is my ex-husband.\\
388 - A role I relish.\\
389 - I need to catch a plane to London,\\
390 - so you'll have to have Ava for the weekend.\\
391 - And what if I have plans?\\
392 - Yes, I can see your plans.\\
393 - Mummy, Daddy said he can't take me to the zoo.\\
394 - Oh, wonderful, just wonderful.\\
395 - Are you and Daddy going to fight?\\
396 - No. Mummy will take you to the zoo instead of Daddy.\\
397 - Brilliant, make me the bad guy.\\
398 - Oh, no one made you the bad guy, you were born to it.\\
399 - Uh, you know what, Ava?\\
400 - I'm a little thirsty.\\
401 - Maybe you could show me where I could get a glass of water.\\
402 - Is it all right, Mummy?\\
403 - Yeah. Good idea.\\
404 - Come on, then.\\
405 - They're gonna fight now.\\
406 - Yeah, I know.\\
407 - So this is what you prefer now, hmm?\\
408 - Underwear models?\\
409 - He happens to be a billionaire.\\
410 - Yes, well, I happen to be 107th in line to the throne.\\
411 - Here's your water.\\
412 - Thank you.\\
413 - You're very welcome.\\
414 - Oh, whoa!\\
415 - This is the best water I have ever had.\\
416 - Did you make this yourself?\\
417 - No, silly, it came out of the fridge.\\
418 - Oh.\\
419 - Well, then cheers.\\
420 - Mmm.\\
421 - I'm a queen.\\
422 - You are?\\
423 - Queen Ava.\\
424 - Well, then what am I?\\
425 - I have no idea.\\
426 - Walden Schmidt, Your Majesty.\\
427 - Pleased to meet you.\\
428 - I shall call you Sir Schmidt.\\
429 - Oh! At your service.\\
430 - Oh!\\
431 - Oh! Oh!\\
432 - Well, you two seem to be getting along.\\
433 - Can Sir Schmidt come with us to the zoo?\\
434 - Sir Schmidt?\\
435 - Hmm. I don't know.\\
436 - Please?\\
437 - He's my loyal subject.\\
438 - Well, I suppose, if he wants.\\
439 - I live to do the queen's bidding.\\
440 - All right, go and get your jacket.\\
441 - Yay!\\
442 - Sir Schmidt?\\
443 - My grandfather shortened it from Schmidt-a-Lot.\\
444 - Oh, goodness.\\
445 - That was quite a day.\\
446 - Yeah. It was fun, wasn't it?\\
447 - It was.\\
448 - Is she still sleeping?\\
449 - She's comatose.\\
450 - Here, let me take her.\\
451 - Shh.\\
452 - Oh, dear, you have a bit of drool on your shoulder.\\
453 - Oh, that's not a problem.\\
454 - My housekeeper has a lot of experience with drool stains.\\
455 - Ah. I'm gonna go and put her down.\\
456 - Be right back.\\
457 - Hey, Jake.\\
458 - Really? You found Zoey.\\
459 - That's great.\\
460 - Thank you.\\
461 - Little dude's got to lay off the brownies.\\
462 - She's absolutely knackered.\\
463 - It was a long day.\\
464 - You were just wonderful with her.\\
465 - Thanks.\\
466 - Well, I guess I better head home.\\
467 - I think not.\\
468 - What's happening?\\
469 - It's very, very simple.\\
470 - I'm going to take you into my bedroom\\
471 - and bang you like a snare drum.\\
472 - Yippee!\\
473 -     Men.\\
474 -     Men.\\
475 - Hey!\\
476 - Oh, hey. Where you been?\\
477 - I went to the zoo with Zoey and her little girl.\\
478 - Wow! So you finally met the daughter.\\
479 - Yep. Might make it tough\\
480 - if the relationship doesn't work out.\\
481 - Why wouldn't it work out?\\
482 - Well, you know, the lack of\\
483 - sexual chemistry you were talking about.\\
484 - Oh, no, we're way past that.\\
485 - Oh. So she opened up about her trust issues?\\
486 - Trust issues?\\
487 - No, zoos make her horny.\\
488 - Really? You think that's it?\\
489 - Yep.\\
490 - Next weekend, we're going to the San Diego Wild Animal Park.\\
491 - Uh...\\
492 - hello.\\
493 - You Walden?\\
494 - Yeah.\\
495 - I Zoey.\\
496 - Ah.\\
497 - It's nice to meet you.\\
498 - Well?\\
499 - Keep looking.\\

1 - Oh, God.\\
2 - That feels so good.\\
3 - Where'd you learn to do that?\\
4 - Chiropractic school?\\
5 - Long before that.\\
6 - When I was a kid, I had to do this for my mom.\\
7 - Had to?\\
8 - If I wanted dessert.\\
9 - Oh, poor baby.\\
10 - Tell you what, when you're done with my other foot,\\
11 - I'll give you a little dessert.\\
12 - Thank you, Mommy.\\
13 - Hey.\\
14 - Hey!\\
15 - Oh, hey. How was the opera?\\
16 - Magnificent.\\
17 - Il Trovatore.\\
18 - Walden cried.\\
19 - - Oh. - Oh.\\
20 - Come on, a guy in a leotard and a skirt\\
21 - realizes he chopped his own brother's head off.\\
22 - That's heartbreaking.\\
23 - I keep trying to take Lyndsey to the opera, but she won't go.\\
24 - I'm sorry,\\
25 - I'm just not a fan of fat people singing in a foreign language\\
26 - for two and a half hours.\\
27 - Well, opera's not for everyone.\\
28 - To appreciate it requires a refined taste\\
29 - and a certain amount of education.\\
30 - Whoa.\\
31 - You did not just say that.\\
32 - Say what?\\
33 - I am plenty refined,\\
34 - and I happen to have an Associate of Arts degree\\
35 - from Santa Monica Community College.\\
36 - I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to be pejorative.\\
37 - What's that supposed to mean?\\
38 - Uh, pejorative is having a derogatory...\\
39 - I know what the word means!\\
40 - Sorry, sorry.\\
41 - What's community college?\\
42 - Is that like a sort of trade school?\\
43 - Let's leave it alone.\\
44 - We've already seen one beheading tonight.\\
45 - Where did you go to college?\\
46 - Oxford?\\
47 - Only for two years.\\
48 - Aw, did you flunk out?\\
49 - No, I transferred to Harvard.\\
50 - Harvard.\\
51 - The Santa Monica Community College of the East.\\
52 - What do you say we go get ready for bed?\\
53 - Yeah, good idea.\\
54 -     Mi chiamano Mimi\\
55 -     Il perch   non so sola, mi fo.    \\
56 - I also took a semester off to study opera in Florence.\\
57 - That's in Italy.\\
58 - Wow.\\
59 - That is one talented lady.\\
60 - And by "talented" I mean annoying,\\
61 - and by "lady" I mean bitch.\\
62 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\

71 -     Men.\\
72 - "Fat people singing in a foreign language."\\
73 - Can you believe her?\\
74 - No. It's unbelievable.\\
75 - Maybe she'd be more appreciative of\\
76 - fat people singing in her native language.\\
77 - No to Pavarotti, yes to Cee Lo Green.\\
78 - Mm. Forget you?\\
79 - Forget her.\\
80 - And then she has the nerve to insult me simply 'cause I have\\
81 - a modicum of sophistication and good taste.\\
82 - Mm, you do taste good.\\
83 - I know what she thinks.\\
84 - She thinks I'm snobbish and condescending.\\
85 - Mm, but you're not.\\
86 - No, I'm not.\\
87 - It's a shame, really.\\
88 - So much I could teach the poor girl.\\
89 - It's her loss.\\
90 - God knows what Alan sees in her.\\
91 - Yeah, he could totally do better.\\
92 - No, he couldn't; he's a complete loser.\\
93 - What are you talking about?\\
94 - Um, you said...\\
95 - Never mind.\\
96 - "Refined taste."\\
97 - I'd like to punch her refined face in.\\
98 - And you could; you hit hard.\\
99 - You know what her problem is?\\
100 - She was born with all the advantages\\
101 - and now she thinks she's better than everyone else.\\
102 - Like her poop doesn't stink.\\
103 - Your poop stinks, honey.\\
104 - Thank you.\\
105 - Especially after Indian food.\\
106 - That is a real working-class stank right there.\\
107 - Boy, I am so turned on right now.\\
108 - What could Walden possibly see in that,\\
109 - in that stuck-up English muffin?\\
110 - Maybe it's her nooks and crannies.\\
111 - What?\\
112 - Uh, you know, English muffin.\\
113 - Uh, nooks and crannies.\\
114 - For the butter.\\
115 - Or margarine, as the case may be.\\
116 - Are you saying you like her body?\\
117 - Oh, no, no.\\
118 - No, it's your body that I love.\\
119 - You've got the stinky poop.\\
120 - Be honest with me.\\
121 - Have I not been entirely civil and charming to her?\\
122 - You have.\\
123 - Then why does she give me that attitude?\\
124 - Who know...? She's crazy.\\
125 - Well, I wouldn't call her crazy; she's certainly unpleasant.\\
126 - That's what I meant.\\
127 - Unpleasant.\\
128 - Are you humoring me just so I'll have sex with you?\\
129 - No. I took you to the opera so you would have sex with me.\\
130 - You're terrible.\\
131 - I'm trying to be,\\
132 - but there's a lot of damn bows here.\\
133 -     Men.\\
134 - Alan?\\
135 - Yeah?\\
136 - I'm sorry I ruined our night.\\
137 - That's okay.\\
138 - No, it's not.\\
139 - Let me make it up to you.\\
140 - Really?\\
141 - I get dessert?\\
142 - Oh, Walden!\\
143 - Oh, my God!\\
144 - Oh, my God! I don't believe it.\\
145 - Do you know what she's doing?\\
146 - Well, I think I have a general idea.\\
147 - She wants me to hear that. Oh, my God!\\
148 - She's rubbing my nose in it.\\
149 - Sounds more like she's rubbing his nose in it.\\
150 - Oh, my God!\\
151 - Two can play at that game.\\
152 - Oh! Oh!\\
153 - Oh! Oh!\\
154 - Oh, my God!\\
155 - Oh!\\
156 - Oh, my God! What are you doing?\\
157 - Making love to you.\\
158 - Oh, my God! Oh!\\
159 - Oh! You want me to help?\\
160 - No, I got this.\\
161 - Oh! Oh!\\
162 - Oh! Oh!\\

171 - Oh!\\
172 - Oh!\\
173 - Oh!\\
174 -     Men.\\
175 - Happy Valentine's Day, darling.\\
176 - You, too, sweetheart.\\
177 - Sounded like you and Zoey were getting an early start\\
178 - on your celebrating last night.\\
179 - Oh, yeah.\\
180 - You and Lyndsey were making\\
181 - quite a bit of a racket yourselves.\\
182 - Oh, you heard that?\\
183 - It was kind of hard not to.\\
184 - Well, you know how it is.\\
185 - Uh, you and I are like the mailmen.\\
186 - Rain or shine, we got to deliver the old package.\\
187 - Handle with care.\\
188 - Express delivery.\\
189 - No, wait, let me think of another one.\\
190 - This side up.\\
191 - Oh.\\
192 - That's good, that's good.\\
193 - Oh, who am I kidding?\\
194 - Last night was a complete sham.\\
195 - What do you mean?\\
196 - Zoey was trying to prove\\
197 - some kind of point to Lyndsey.\\
198 - So, all that noise was, uh...?\\
199 - I had nothing to do with it.\\
200 - Sorry.\\
201 - Well, since we're being honest, I should probably tell you...\\
202 - I... had what was probably the best sex of my life last night.\\
203 - Good morning.\\
204 - Huh?\\
205 - Oh, morning.\\
206 - Sleep well?\\
207 - Terrific.\\
208 - Good. I was afraid we might have kept you awake.\\
209 - Really?\\
210 - I was worried we might have kept you awake.\\
211 - No, no, I slept like a baby.\\
212 - Hope you didn't wet the bed.\\
213 - They're laughing.\\
214 - That's good, right?\\
215 - Not that laugh.\\
216 - That's the bad laugh.\\
217 - Shame it has to be raining on Valentine's Day.\\
218 - Yeah, well, fortunately, the sun is shining in Cabo San Lucas.\\
219 - Thanks for the weather report.\\
220 - Now here's Alan with the sports.\\
221 - I just meant that's where Walden and I\\
222 - are flying for dinner tonight.\\
223 - Really?\\
224 - Good luck with LAX.\\
225 - Place is gonna be a madhouse.\\
226 - That may well be.\\
227 - Luckily, Walden's got his private jet, so...\\
228 - Of course he does.\\
229 - Or they could fly down on her private broom.\\
230 - What are you and Alan doing to celebrate?\\
231 - Oh, don't worry about us.\\
232 - We have big plans.\\
233 - Ooh.\\
234 - Another festive foot rub?\\
235 - Bad laugh?\\
236 - As a matter of fact, we're gonna spend the night\\
237 - at a little bed-and-breakfast\\
238 - outside Santa Barbara where we're gonna\\
239 - drink wine, read poetry\\
240 - and have hot, kinky sex.\\
241 - Right, Alan?\\
242 - Oh, yeah, sure.\\
243 - Uh, sure.\\
244 - The, uh, the holy trinity of Valentine's Day:\\
245 - sips, sonnets and sodomy.\\
246 - That's interesting.\\
247 - I can see you as a drunken sodomite,\\
248 - never imagined you liking poetry.\\
249 - Oh, no, no, I really do.\\
250 - Here's a poem you might appreciate.\\
251 - "Roses are red,\\
252 - "violets are blue,\\
253 - "I'm a nice person\\
254 - and you can bite my pale, unrefined ass."\\
255 - A lady doesn't bite.\\
256 - Hmm.\\
257 - She will however be happy\\
258 - to make you wear that ass as a bonnet.\\
259 - What the hell?\\
260 - Oh, my Lord.\\
261 - Where's the road?\\
262 - Probably inside that giant sinkhole.\\
263 - It looks like nobody's going anywhere today.\\
264 - Oh, smashing.\\
265 - Swell.\\
266 - Sodomy?\\
267 - Sodom-ish.\\
268 -     Men.\\
269 -     Men.\\
270 - They say the road might be closed for another 48 hours.\\
271 - And that's if the rain lets up.\\
272 - Better call my ex-husband, let him know\\
273 - I probably won't be picking up Ava tomorrow.\\
274 - Better call my son, tell him I'll be home early.\\
275 - Early?\\
276 - I can't tell him the truth.\\
277 - If he knows I could be gone for two days,\\
278 - I might not have a house when I get back.\\
279 - Nice to have a relationship with your child built on trust.\\
280 - Excuse me?\\
281 - I'm just saying, I never lie to my daughter.\\
282 - Really? And how old is she?\\
283 - She's six. Aw.\\
284 - They're so precious at that age, aren't they?\\
285 - They are.\\
286 - Call me in a few years when she's pierced and pregnant\\
287 - with a pocket full of 30-day chips.\\
288 - There's no need to be crude.\\
289 - Oh, so now I'm crude?\\
290 - Not just now.\\
291 - That's it.\\
292 - Get ready for an old-fashioned\\
293 - trade school beat-down.\\
294 - Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!\\
295 - Slow down. Slow it down. No! No!\\
296 - Little Miss Muffet's going to get knocked on her tuffet!\\
297 - Oh, bring it on, Snooki!\\
298 - Okay. Okay. No.\\
299 - Baby, baby, no.\\
300 - We're in a tough situation here.\\
301 - But this is a big house, and we're all adults.\\
302 - Yeah, some of us older than others.\\
303 - Oh!\\
304 - Walden's right. Walden's right.\\
305 - We got to make the best of this.\\
306 - You know, we can, uh... uh, we can play video games,\\
307 - listen to music, watch movies.\\
308 - We're all going to die.\\
309 -     Men.\\
310 - I'm sorry.\\
311 - I'm not going to stay in the same house\\
312 - as that horrible wom.\\
313 - Okay, first of all, the road's closed,\\
314 - so nobody's going anywhere.\\
315 - And second of all, uh, she's not that horrible.\\
316 - What did you say?\\
317 - I said, "The road's closed."\\
318 - After that.\\
319 - "Nobody's going anywhere."\\
320 - Are you defending her?\\
321 - Oh, come on.\\
322 - It's a funny situation when you think about it.\\
323 - Two women who shouldn't be anywhere near each other\\
324 - trapped in a house 'cause of a silly rain storm.\\
325 - That's a bad laugh.\\
326 -     Men.\\
327 - Oh, great.\\
328 - I just got my period.\\
329 - Oh, joy.\\
330 - My bloody Valentine.\\
331 - I'm out of tampons.\\
332 - You have to go get me some.\\
333 - What?\\
334 - Have you looked outside?\\
335 - Yeah. It's raining.\\
336 - This is not rain.\\
337 - This is some sort of biblical punishment.\\
338 - There's only one flood you need to be concerned about.\\
339 - Why don't you just ask Zoey for one?\\
340 - Why don't I take that light off your head\\
341 - and give you a quick colonoscopy?\\
342 - At least now we know why you're in such a bad mood.\\
343 - What did you just say?\\
344 - I said I'm going to the drugstore\\
345 - to buy you tampons.\\
346 - You're so pretty.\\
347 - Hey. Hi.\\
348 - Where you going?\\
349 - I am going to swim down to the drugstore\\
350 - and bob for tampons.\\
351 - Really? In-in this weather?\\
352 - What, are you out of your mind\\
353 - Walden!\\
354 - I'll come with you.\\
355 -     Men.\\
356 - Looks like it's starting to let up.\\
357 - Yeah, this is blowing over.\\
358 - It's actually kind of refreshing.\\
359 - And we certainly need the water.\\
360 - It's weird how people in L.A.\\
361 - make such a big fuss over a little rain.\\
362 - That's the new Smart car.\\
363 - Doesn't look so smart now.\\
364 -     Men.\\
365 - Ah.\\
366 - Hi.\\
367 - Hi.\\
368 - Do you happen to know where Walden is?\\
369 - I happen to not.\\
370 - All right.\\
371 - Well, where's Alan?\\
372 - He went for a walk.\\
373 - A walk?\\
374 - Yeah, a walk.\\
375 - That's how poor people get from one place to another.\\
376 - All right.\\
377 - Mind if I share your wine?\\
378 - I don't know if you'll like it.\\
379 - It's domestic.\\
380 - Alan bought it.\\
381 - Actually, I quite like California wine.\\
382 - It's from Wisconsin.\\
383 - Ah.\\
384 - Well, desperate times.\\
385 - Shame our girlfriends don't get along, huh?\\
386 - Yeah, if they don't start playing nice with each other,\\
387 - you're going to have to find a new place to live.\\
388 - No doubt.\\
389 - Or I could find another girlfriend.\\
390 -     Men.\\
391 - Well, cheers.\\
392 - Cheers.\\
393 - For the record, I like Walden very much.\\
394 - He seems like a great guy.\\
395 - Well, thank you.\\
396 - Alan's...\\
397 - Thank you.\\
398 - So... what's your plan\\
399 - for the young, gorgeous billionaire?\\
400 - I'm sorry. Plan?\\
401 - Oh, come on.\\
402 - Educated girl like you?\\
403 - You got to have a plan to nail him down.\\
404 - I don't.\\
405 - My feelings for Walden are genuine.\\
406 - I have no desire to manipulate him\\
407 - into some sort of commitment.\\
408 - Huh.\\
409 - But if I did, what sort of plan do you think might work?\\
410 - Well, first thing I'd do is throw out my diaphragm.\\
411 - I'm on the pill.\\
412 - All right.\\
413 - Swap out those puppies for Tic Tacs.\\
414 - You know, it's actually good\\
415 - that Lyndsey sent me to the drugstore.\\
416 - 'Cause now I can pick up her Valentine's Day gift.\\
417 - Nice!\\
418 - Yeah, nothing says "I love you" like Q-tips and stool softener.\\
419 - I-I was thinking of something more...\\
420 - Alan!\\
421 - Tell Jake I love him!\\
422 - And buy Lyndsey tampons!\\
423 -     Men.\\
424 -     Men.\\
425 - So, anyway, then we got married and had my son, Eldridge.\\
426 - How long after?\\
427 - Actually, my water broke during the ceremony.\\
428 - Really put a crimp in the reception.\\
429 - Tell me about your ex.\\
430 - Nigel.\\
431 - Oh, God, how can I describe Nigel?\\
432 - Highly educated, extremely cultured,\\
433 - and as you Americans might say...\\
434 - "a total freakin' douche bag."\\
435 - Really?\\
436 - My ex-husband is, as you Brits might say...\\
437 - "a right bloody wanker."\\
438 - Looks like we both traded up, huh?\\
439 - Yes, absolutely.\\
440 - Cheers to us. Mmm.\\
441 - This is turning out to be a pretty nice Valentine's Day.\\
442 - It is, isn't it?\\
443 - Thanks for the tampon, by the way.\\
444 - Oh, pleasure.\\
445 - Appears our cycles have synched up.\\
446 - Yeah.\\
447 - Probably why we haven't seen the boys for a while.\\
448 - We have been a bit out of sorts.\\
449 - Mmm. Edgy.\\
450 - Moody.\\
451 - Bitchy. Bitchy.\\
452 - Oh, I do hope our fellows are all right.\\
453 - I'm sure they're fine.\\
454 - Yeah.\\
455 - Let me go!\\
456 - Save yourself! No!\\
457 - If you go, I go!\\
458 - Hey, Lyndsey.\\
459 - Yeah, we haven't gotten to the drugstore yet.\\
460 - We're in a little bit of a situation here.\\
461 - All right.\\
462 - What kind of ice cream?\\
463 - Seriously, let me go.\\

3 - And now we are stuck in traffic.\\
4 - Yeah, bumper to bumper.\\
5 - Well, tell Ava I'll be there in an hour, okay?\\
6 - Okay.\\
7 - Why didn't you just tell him the truth?\\
8 - Because I know my ex-husband quite well,\\
9 - and it would really upset him if he found out\\
10 - you flew me to San Francisco in your private jet\\
11 - just to have fried clams.\\
12 - Yeah, you're right.\\
13 - You shouldn't tell him.\\
14 - Thank you.\\
15 - I'll tell him.\\

45 - What's sadder than an empty bottle of wine?\\
46 - Being the boyfriend of a 40-year-old drunk soccer mom.\\
47 - What?\\
48 - Oh, I was just thinking\\
49 - you might want to slow down a little.\\
50 - It's only wine, geez.\\
51 - It's only been wine since last July.\\
52 - Hey, hey, that got a three-star rating\\
53 - in the Wal-Mart wine tracker.\\
54 - What's the big deal?\\
55 - So, I need a few glasses to loosen me up.\\
56 - Are you saying you need to get loaded\\
57 - in order to have sex with me?\\
58 - I'm not loaded. Fine.\\
59 - But it doesn't hurt.\\
60 - Hey, guys.\\
61 - Wally! Want some wine?\\
62 - No, I don't like to drink when I'm depressed.\\
63 - Wally, it's the best time to drink.\\
64 - Also when you're bored, lonely, or just, you know,\\
65 - too sober.\\
66 - Why are you depressed?\\
67 - I don't know.\\
68 - It's kind of personal.\\
69 - Okay, no problem.\\
70 - What do you do when you\\
71 - tell someone you love them and they don't respond?\\
72 - Drink.\\
73 - Wait, you told Zoey you love her?\\
74 - Yeah, I thought the plane was gonna crash,\\
75 - and it just kind of came out,\\
76 - along with a little squirt of pee.\\
77 - So, what did she say?\\
78 - "Oh, God, oh, God, I don't want to die."\\
79 - Well, given the circumstance, that's a legitimate response.\\
80 - Sure, in the moment,\\
81 - but what about after the plane leveled out?\\
82 - Well, what did she say then?\\
83 - "Why do I smell pee?"\\
84 - Then we just sat there in silence\\
85 - for the rest of the flight.\\
86 - Should have drank.\\
87 - Yeah, well, I'm gonna go change my underwear\\
88 - before I get diaper rash.\\
89 - Wow, I feel bad for him.\\
90 - Yeah.\\
91 - I mean, you know, to tell somebody you love them,\\
92 - and just get no response.\\
93 - Awful.\\
94 - You know how I feel about you, right?\\
95 - Right.\\
96 - You know how I feel about you.\\
97 - Oh, absolutely.\\
98 - Still nice to hear on occasion.\\
99 - Oh, I agree.\\
100 - I can do this as long as you can, pal.\\
101 - It's open.\\
102 - Hey.\\
103 - Can I talk to you for a minute?\\
104 - Sure. What's up?\\
105 - I didn't sleep at all last night, man.\\
106 - This Zoey stuff is making me crazy.\\
107 - Oh, man, I'm sorry.\\
108 - I'm starting to wonder\\
109 - if I should break up with her,\\
110 - Oh, hang on. I mean, just because she didn't say,\\
111 - "I love you," doesn't mean she doesn't feel it.\\
112 - You think?\\
113 - Oh, yeah, yeah. Some people have a hard time\\
114 - articulating their feelings,\\
115 - so they express them in other ways.\\
116 - Is that Lyndsey?\\
117 - Yeah, she had a little too much vino last night.\\
118 - Anyway, I think you just have to be patient with Zoey.\\
119 - Yeah, I guess.\\
120 - Sorry, I... I have a... a hard time with...\\
121 - people throwing up.\\
122 - Try watching and holding her hair.\\
123 - It's just, Zoey's going to England for a few weeks.\\
124 - And-and I'm th...\\
125 - I'm-I'm starting to think if...\\
126 - if I'm gonna end it, now would be a good time.\\
127 - Well, it...\\
128 - Whoa.\\
129 - You think I'd be used to it by now.\\
130 - No, no, no, don't...\\
131 - Don't do anything hasty.\\
132 - I can't... I... I can't just leave th...\\
133 - I can't just leave things the way that they are.\\
134 - Why don't you... Why don't you go talk to her,\\
135 - you know, and just put your caaards on the table.\\
136 - Yeah, maybe.\\
137 - Crap,\\
138 - now I've got to change my bra.\\
139 - I-I-I mean, maybe we should just give her some privacy.\\
140 - Oh, God, now it's coming out both ends!\\
141 - Good idea.\\
142 - Ava, you need to get dressed.\\
143 - Mummy has to go.\\
144 - Walden.\\
145 - De-e-lightful.\\
146 - Nigel, di-isgusting.\\
147 - What, are you here to pick up your daughter?\\
148 - I am.\\
149 - Zoey tell you that we took my jet to San Francisco\\
150 - last night for fried clams?\\
151 - No, she did not.\\
152 - Well, we did.\\
153 - Are you sharing this information just to upset me?\\
154 - Actually, I was hoping to make you feel inadequate as well.\\
155 - Oh, Walden.\\
156 - What are you doing here?\\
157 - Nigel, I'm running late,\\
158 - so will you for once please make yourself useful\\
159 - and help Ava get ready?\\
160 - Well, only because you asked so nicely.\\
161 - Enjoy her.\\
162 - Hi.\\
163 - We need to talk.\\
164 - Now? I'm about to leave for the airport.\\
165 - I'll take you.\\
166 - Thanks, but I have a car coming.\\
167 - Now, where is my passport?\\
168 - Nigel, have you seen my passport?\\
169 - I don't live here, Zoey,\\
170 - I merely pay the rent.\\
171 - Look, I just don't want to leave things between us\\
172 - the way that they are.\\
173 - Everything's fine.\\
174 - No, it's not.\\
175 - I said I love you, and the only thing\\
176 - I got in response is the not very surprising information\\
177 - that you don't want to die in a crashing plane.\\
178 - Can't we discuss this when I get back?\\
179 - What's there to discuss?\\
180 - You either love me, or you don't.\\
181 - Walden, I'm about to leave on an important business trip,\\
182 - and the last thing I need right now is more pressure.\\
183 - I'm not pressuring you.\\
184 - I'm just asking you for a simple, definitive answer\\
185 - right now before you leave.\\
186 - What was that?\\
187 - Sorry, just knocked over your Chinese table lamp.\\
188 - Perhaps you can buy another one\\
189 - next time you jet to Francisco.\\
190 - It came up.\\
191 - I'm sorry, I just don't have the time for this now, okay?\\
192 - Ava, are you dressed?\\
193 - That seems pretty definitive to me.\\
194 - That's it.\\
195 - No more relationships. I'm done.\\
196 - Finished; just over.\\
197 - Hi.\\
198 - Hi.\\
199 - And I'm back.\\
200 -     Men\\
201 - Hey, can I have 75 bucks for the new Call of Duty?\\
202 - $75 for a video game?\\
203 - Think of it as an investment.\\
204 - An investment?\\
205 - Yeah. If I go into the army after high school,\\
206 - I'll already know how to kill terrorists.\\
207 - Who had corn chowder for dinner last night?\\
208 - How do you know anybody had corn chowder last night?\\
209 - 'Cause it's dripping all over your bathroom.\\
210 - Oh.\\
211 - Sorry about that.\\
212 - Uh, Lyndsey got a little bit...\\
213 - queasy this morning.\\
214 - Is she pregnant?\\
215 - Oh, no, no, gosh, no.\\
216 - Absolutely not.\\
217 - Here.\\
218 - Me?\\
219 - Not my girlfriend, not my vomit,\\
220 - not my problem.\\
221 - I'll clean it up.\\
222 - You will?\\
223 - For 75 bucks.\\
224 - That's great.\\
225 - Hey, everybody.\\
226 - This is Jennifer. Hi.\\
227 - - Hey. - Hey.\\
228 - Well, let's go take a walk on the beach.\\
229 - Great.\\
230 - Uh, Walden, before you go,\\
231 - can I talk to you for a minute?\\
232 - I'll bring him right back.\\
233 - You'd better.\\
234 - My name's Jake.\\
235 - Hi, Jake.\\
236 - My friends call me... Jake.\\
237 - What are you doing?\\
238 - Zoey made it perfectly clear.\\
239 - She doesn't love me or need me.\\
240 - So, I'm moving on.\\
241 - You left here an hour ago.\\
242 - How did you find another girl already?\\
243 - Oh, I met her in the elevator.\\
244 - I've been in a million elevators.\\
245 - I never once walked out with a girl like that.\\
246 - Maybe you need to work on your attitude.\\
247 - What exactly did Zoey say?\\
248 - No, it's what she didn't say.\\
249 - She didn't say, "I love you."\\
250 - Oh, please! If I insisted on women saying "I love you""\\
251 - I'd have never have had a girlfriend, a wife or a mother.\\
252 - Oh. It's Zoey.\\
253 - Hello?\\
254 - So, Jennifer, how old are you?\\
255 - 24. How old are you?\\
256 - I'm... 24-and-a-half.\\
257 - Hmm.\\
258 - Hmm?\\
259 - I'm surprised that you called.\\
260 - Where are you?\\
261 - On the plane.\\
262 - We're sitting at the gate.\\
263 - - Are you okay? - No.\\
264 - I feel miserable about the way we left things.\\
265 - - You do? - Yeah.\\
266 - I've just been so stressed and busy lately\\
267 - that I haven't been able to think straight.\\
268 - But sitting here for the last 40 minutes\\
269 - without so much as a bloody glass of water,\\
270 - I've come to a realization.\\
271 - I'm listening.\\
272 - The reason I haven't said...\\
273 - those words to you\\
274 - is because I'm afraid\\
275 - that if I do say them, something bad will happen.\\
276 - Why would you think that?\\
277 - 'Cause it always has.\\
278 - I've only said those words twice.\\
279 - The last time, I ended up married\\
280 - to an insufferable twit.\\
281 - And the time before that?\\
282 - I got a thank-you note\\
283 - and a Swatch watch from Russell Brand.\\
284 - Russell Brand?\\
285 - Mm, not my proudest moment.\\
286 - Okay. I get it.\\
287 - So, you're just superstitious about saying it,\\
288 - but it has nothing to do with the way that you feel about me?\\
289 - No. Not at all.\\
290 - In fact, the whole reason I called is\\
291 - to tell you that I honestly I...\\
292 - Oh, there you are.\\
293 - Ooh! Cool bedroom.\\
294 - Who's that?\\
295 - Uh... Berta.\\
296 - You couldn't even wait till my plane takes off?!\\
297 - No, no, Zoey, it's not what you think! Oh, good-bye, Walden.\\
298 - Zoey, just...\\
299 -     Awkward!\\
300 - Oh... I can't believe I kissed the mouth that did this.\\
301 - Alan, I need to talk to you. Oh!\\
302 - Can we do it out here?\\
303 - Gladly.\\
304 - Oh, good Lord!\\
305 - Looks like someone cleaned a deer in the bathtub.\\
306 - What's going on?\\
307 - Zoey FaceTimed me from the plane\\
308 - to tell me that she loves me.\\
309 - Good.\\
310 - But she saw Jennifer in my bedroom.\\
311 - Bad.\\
312 - So, naturally, I immediately tried to call her back.\\
313 - Good. But she wouldn't answer.\\
314 - Bad. So I'm gonna fuel up my jet,\\
315 - and fly to London and beg for forgiveness.\\
316 - Good. Will you stop that, Alan?\\
317 - I-I need you to come with me. Me? Why?\\
318 - Because I might need a witness, and you can say\\
319 - that you saw that nothing happened with Jennifer.\\
320 - Great. I'm your man.\\
321 - I am not gonna touch that glove.\\
322 - Come on.\\
323 - Oh, uh, wait.\\
324 - I promised Lyndsey I'd take her out\\
325 - to a big, fancy, romantic dinner tonight.\\
326 - Bring her. Really?\\
327 - Yeah, sure.\\
328 - Well, I guess a private jet\\
329 - to London does beat\\
330 - an 11-year-old Volvo to the Olive Garden.\\
331 - I'll-I'll pack a bag.\\
332 - No, no, no, there's no time.\\
333 - I'll buy you whatever you need in London.\\
334 - You're kidding. Yeah. Come on.\\
335 - Hey, if Zoey won't say it, I will.\\
336 - I love you, Walden Schmidt.\\
337 - Thank you, Walden.\\
338 - This is just incredible.\\
339 - Glad you like it. Mm.\\
340 - What did your son say when you told him\\
341 - you were flying to London tonight?\\
342 - He told me to bring him back some English pot.\\
343 - This is definitely the way to travel.\\
344 - No boarding passes, no airport security,\\
345 - none of those scanners\\
346 - that show strangers the size of your dingle.\\
347 - Don't you worry about your dingle, honey.\\
348 - He's a grower, not a shower.\\
349 - Yeah, he told me.\\
350 - He tells everyone.\\
351 - Can I interest you in a brewski?\\
352 - What?\\
353 - That's Polish for\\
354 - "Do you want a beer?"\\
355 - I've traveled extensively through Asia.\\
356 - Oh. Thanks.\\
357 - Are you sure Walden said he'd be right back?\\
358 - Forget Walden.\\
359 - Let's talk about us.\\
360 - Us?\\
361 - That's English for you and me.\\
362 -     Poppin' bottles in the ice\\
363 -     Like a blizzard\\
364 -     When we drunk, we do it right, gettin' slizzard    \\
365 -     Like a G-6, like a G-6...\\
366 - Uh, honey, honey, why don't you take your seat\\
367 - and put your seatbelt on?\\
368 - Pish, pish, party pooper.\\
369 - Wally, this is so romantic what you're doing.\\
370 - You are flying across a whole ocean\\
371 - just to win back the woman you love.\\
372 - Thank you.\\
373 - Alan, sweetie, I need to tell you something.\\
374 - Yeah?\\
375 - I know I give you a hard time,\\
376 - but in my heart,\\
377 - I really, really love...\\
378 - Oh, God!\\
379 - Oh. Aah.\\
380 - I'm so sorry.\\
381 - Oh! Oh!\\
382 - Oh. Oh.\\
383 - So sorry. Here. Here.\\
384 - Oh, thank you.\\
385 - Oh, God!\\
386 - Oh! Oh, my God!\\
387 - Oh, hang on. Oh, God!\\
388 - I'll-I'll get... I'll get some towels.\\
389 - Okay, folks,\\
390 - we've got clear skies ahead,\\
391 - and we'll be in London in approximately four hours.\\
392 - So, just sit back and enjoy the rest of your flight.\\
393 -     Men.\\
394 - Bottom line, Zoey, I can assure you\\
395 - that nothing happened between Walden and that woman.\\
396 - Really?\\
397 - What possible reason would I have to lie to you?\\
398 - Well, for one thing, he gave\\
399 - you and Lyndsey a free trip to London,\\
400 - where you all inexplicably decided\\
401 - to dress up like Japanese tourists.\\
402 - That's my fault.\\
403 - I kind of threw up on them a little.\\
404 - A little? I might have to get a new plane.\\
405 - Yes, yes, yes, that's all very interesting,\\
406 - but the fact remains\\
407 - that you still invited my neighbor Jennifer--\\
408 - the whore from the seventh floor--\\
409 - back to your house.\\
410 - Yeah, but nothing happened.\\
411 - Nothing happened 'cause I called and interrupted you!\\
412 - Okay, I think we're saying the same thing here.\\
413 - Listen, the fact is, I love you.\\
414 - Okay, and I was an idiot to put pressure on you,\\
415 - I made a terrible mistake, and I'm very, very sorry.\\
416 - Okay. Uh, we sh...\\
417 - I think we should go.\\
418 - I do love you, Walden.\\
419 - You do?\\
420 - Of course I do.\\
421 - That's why I called you from the plane, you ninny.\\
422 - So...\\
423 - you forgive me?\\
424 - Well, that depends.\\
425 - Do I have to worry every time we have a fight\\
426 - that you're going to go out and pick up another woman?\\
427 - Not as long as I know that you love me.\\
428 - Good answer.\\
429 - Come here.\\
430 - I love you, Lyndsey.\\
431 - And I love you.\\
432 - Oh, not in my mouth!\\
433 - Oh, God.\\
434 - Oh, dear.\\
435 - No, seriously, dude. No lie.\\
436 - All right, fine, you don't believe me? Here.\\
437 - Yup. Five times. Best half hour of my life.\\

34 - And click on "forgot password."\\
35 - Hey, there's a password hint.\\
36 - "What is my favorite state?"\\
37 - Uh, California?\\
38 - You are a hacker's nightmare.\\
39 - Not California.\\
40 - Huh.\\
41 - Gosh, um, try Hawaii.\\
42 - Nope.\\
43 - The good news is we only have 48 states to go.\\
44 - Favorite state, favorite state.\\
45 - What's my favorite state?\\
46 - (Skype ringtone plays)\\
47 - I'm getting a Skype call.\\
48 - (groans) It's my ex-wife.\\
49 - Hi, Walden.\\
50 - Hi, Bridget.\\
51 - Engorged!\\
52 - My favorite state is fully engorged!\\
53 - Hello, Alan.\\
54 - Hi, Bridget.\\
55 - Um, that was just my-my password.\\
56 - You know what? I'll just let you guys talk.\\
57 - How do you explain him to people?\\
58 - I usually tell people that my wife drove me to homosexuality.\\
59 - What's up?\\
60 - Billy called.\\
61 - Billy Stanhope?\\
62 - Yeah, he said he's has a business proposition for you.\\
63 - Really?\\
64 - Why on Earth would I do business with him\\
65 - after what he did to me?\\
66 - Hey, don't get upset with me. I'm just the messenger.\\
67 - I'm not upset. I've moved on.\\
68 - It, uh, it's behind me.\\
69 - Yeah, I recognize your "I'm not upset" eye twitch.\\
70 - My eye is not twitching.\\
71 - You know, tell him thank you, but no, thank you.\\
72 - Got it.\\
73 - I wish him well, but I pass.\\
74 - Fine.\\
75 - I'm flattered, but no can do.\\
76 - Understood.\\
77 - And if my eye is twitching,\\
78 - it's only because I have conjunctivitis.\\
79 - You don't have conjunctivitis, Walden.\\
80 - We're not married anymore, Bridget.\\
81 - You have no idea what kind of diseases I have.\\
82 - Good-bye.\\
83 - How about that.\\
84 - Billy Stanhope.\\
85 - (chuckles)\\
86 - (screams)\\
87 - (gasps)\\
88 - Whoa!\\
89 - Everything okay?\\
90 - Yeah. Why?\\
91 - Uh... the blood-curdling scream?\\
92 - Oh, yeah. Sorry.\\
93 - No, no, I often react that way after chatting with my ex-wife.\\
94 - (chuckles) This isn't about my ex-wife.\\
95 - It's about my ex-friend Billy Stanhope.\\
96 - Oh, I've never heard you mention him before.\\
97 - Have you ever heard me mention rectal cancer?\\
98 - No.\\
99 - Same principle.\\
100 - What went down between you two?\\
101 - (chuckles)\\
102 - Well, we built\\
103 - a software company in Bridget's garage,\\
104 - and then sold it for a couple billion dollars.\\
105 - That son of a bitch.\\
106 - No wonder you hate him.\\
107 - I don't think you understand.\\
108 - He didn't want to sell, so when we did, he went crazy.\\
109 - Really?\\
110 - Yeah, oh, yeah.\\
111 - Here, look, he put it on YouTube\\
112 - for the whole world to see.\\
113 - BILLY: Hello, world.\\
114 - It's me, Billy Stanhope,\\
115 - and I'm here to drop another smart bomb of truth!\\
116 - This is my ex-partner Walden Schmidt.\\
117 - Oh, isn't he pretty?\\
118 - Hey, Walden, tell everyone how pretty you are.\\
119 - I'm pretty!\\
120 - (makes kissing sounds)\\
121 - Yes, you are. You are pretty.\\
122 - But that's just on the outside.\\
123 - On the inside, you are a soul-sucking,\\
124 - money-grubbing sellout!\\
125 - Oh, don't forget giant douche.\\
126 - I'm also a giant douche!\\
127 - Thanks, buddy.\\
128 - I'm always forgetting about your extreme doucheyness!\\
129 - You know what I'm gonna do, Walden?\\
130 - I... I'm gonna eat you, yeah.\\
131 - I'm gonna eat you and chew you up,\\
132 - and digest you and then go in the bathroom\\
133 - and take a big steaming Schmidt!\\
134 - Whoa.\\
135 - You think that's bad.\\
136 - Watch this one.\\
137 - Hey, folks! Walden Schmidt here.\\
138 - I just wanted you to see me as I really am.\\
139 - So he's actually talking out of his ass?\\
140 - He calls it "buttriloquism"\\
141 - That's-That's very disturbing.\\
142 - Yeah.\\
143 - That's the least disturbing\\
144 - of the ass-talking videos.\\
145 - (stammering): It-It's crazy.\\
146 - I made this guy, like, a billion dollars,\\
147 - and then he turns on me.\\
148 - And then he accuses me of being a sellout.\\
149 - Talk about ingratitude.\\
150 - If you made me rich,\\
151 - the only thing I'd accuse you of\\
152 - is being the best... guy ever.\\
153 - Thanks.\\
154 - Seriously. If you don't believe it,\\
155 - throw me a couple of mil and get ready for a tongue bath.\\
156 - I doubt that will be necessary.\\
157 - I am not talking just metaphorically.\\
158 - I will lick you from head to toe.\\
159 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
160 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
161 - * Men. *\\
162 - (doorbell rings)\\
163 - Surprise.\\
164 - You gotta be kidding me.\\
165 - Walden...\\
166 - Walden, come on!\\
167 - Hey, who's at the door?\\
168 - Rectal cancer!\\
169 - (knocking)\\
170 - (knocking continues)\\
171 - Hi.\\
172 - Hi.\\
173 - I'm Billy Stanhope.\\
174 - Oh, yeah, yeah. I recognize you from the video.\\
175 - You look good.\\
176 - Well, you know, I cut out sugar and took up yoga,\\
177 - stopped smoking crack.\\
178 - Well, whatever it is you're doing, it's working.\\
179 - Who are you?\\
180 - Oh, yeah, I'm Walden's friend...\\
181 - confidante, mentor, gatekeeper.\\
182 - Oh, yeah, Bridget told me about you.\\
183 - Yeah, the leech.\\
184 - Alan Harper. Pleased to meet you.\\
185 - Hey. Listen, gatekeeper, any way I could talk\\
186 - to Walden for just five minutes?\\
187 - Oh, I don't think so. He's pretty peeved.\\
188 - I got this billion-dollar idea\\
189 - that can't move forward without him.\\
190 - But, look, if he won't see me, he won't see me, so...\\
191 - Hold up, Billy.\\
192 - Come on in. Come on in.\\
193 - Uh, talk to me.\\
194 - So, uh, a billion dollars, you say?\\
195 - At least. Wow.\\
196 - What could possibly be worth a billion dollars?\\
197 - It's simple, really.\\
198 - I mean, are you familiar with\\
199 - Web-based aggregate upstream power grid manipulation?\\
200 - Uh... I-I have Netflix.\\
201 - Okay, look, it's not important.\\
202 - If you could just...\\
203 - I just need to talk to him for five minutes.\\
204 - I don't think that's gonna happen.\\
205 - All right. Here's $50.00.\\
206 - Wait right here. Okay.\\
207 - (knocking on door) Yeah?\\
208 - ALAN: Got a second?\\
209 - Yeah, come in.\\
210 - Whatcha doin'?\\
211 - Playing a racing game.\\
212 - Ah, that's fun.\\
213 - Uh, after my divorce, I played "World of Warcraft" for a while,\\
214 - hoping to meet girls.\\
215 - Did you meet any?\\
216 - Well, let's just say, if you're\\
217 - lonely enough and drunk enough, everybody's a girl.\\
218 - So, listen, um, I was having\\
219 - a very interesting conversation with your former compadre.\\
220 - You let that son of a bitch in my house?\\
221 - Uh, well, yeah, I-I was just...\\
222 - You let him in my house?!\\
223 - Well, I didn't see any harm.\\
224 - I kinda felt sorry for the guy.\\
225 - I thought I could trust you, Alan!\\
226 - You can! I just got sucked in by the words\\
227 - "billion dollar idea."\\
228 - What idea?\\
229 - Uh, something about, uh,\\
230 - upstream grid perambulation?\\
231 - What?\\
232 - Uh, in-in-incubation... ma... ma-masturbation...\\
233 - I don't know!\\
234 - Was it Web-based aggregated\\
235 - upstream power grid manipulation?\\
236 - Yes, that's it.\\
237 - Oh, my God...\\
238 - He figured out The Electric Suitcase.\\
239 - Is it really worth a billion dollars?\\
240 - Oh, yeah.\\
241 - Probably should've held out for more than 50.\\
242 - All right, let's hear it.\\
243 - Oh, you look good without the beard.\\
244 - And you look good without the crack pipe.\\
245 - Okay, just...\\
246 - You really think\\
247 - we can finally build The Electric Suitcase?\\
248 - Yes. We have the technology now.\\
249 - I-I just need you to help me write the code.\\
250 - (exaggerated scoffing)\\
251 - Really?\\
252 - You need my help?\\
253 - 'Cause I-I thought I was just a pretty face,\\
254 - and you were the brains behind the operation.\\
255 - Okay, we both know that was Class-A narcotics\\
256 - and psychotic jealousy joining forces to...\\
257 - to tell the truth.\\
258 - Okay.\\
259 - Say you're sorry and... we'll get to work.\\
260 - I'm here, isn't that enough?\\
261 - Nope. Get out. Okay.\\
262 - Wait, what-whatever.\\
263 - Fine.\\
264 - I'm...\\
265 - Oh, wait.\\
266 - Wald, come on, man.\\
267 - Okay. Go.\\
268 - I'm sorry.\\
269 - I'm sorry to who?\\
270 - I'm sorry to Walden Schmidt.\\
271 - For?\\
272 - (sighs)\\
273 - For calling him names.\\
274 - And?\\
275 - Frivolously suing him for $100 million.\\
276 - Okay.\\
277 - Now cross your eyes, stick out your tongue,\\
278 - and dance like a monkey.\\
279 - (laughs)\\
280 - I will rip your throat out!\\
281 - Bring it on, Poppin' Fresh!\\
282 - I will do it! Fellas! Fellas!\\
283 - I will do it!\\
284 - Oh, wait!\\
285 - Hey, hey, hey!\\
286 - (Billy shrieking)\\
287 - (all shouting)\\
288 - I'm getting too old for this crap.\\
289 - * Men. *\\
290 - Now, come on, shake hands.\\
291 - I don't wanna.\\
292 - Okay.\\
293 - Walden, you want to be the bigger man?\\
294 - I am the bigger man.\\
295 - Oh, that's-- yeah, with the short jokes, okay.\\
296 - No, you are a short joke.\\
297 - (mocking): "You are a short joke."\\
298 - Walden, that's not helping.\\
299 - Now, come on, guys, this is silly!\\
300 - Now, you've got a billion-dollar idea\\
301 - waiting for us.\\
302 - Us? Us?\\
303 - Okay, you.\\
304 - Bring it in.\\
305 - See, see? Was that so hard?\\
306 - Guess not.\\
307 - Remember the fight we had\\
308 - over what to name our first piece of software?\\
309 - (chuckles): Yeah.\\
310 - You wanted to call it MusicAlgorithm.com.\\
311 - Yeah, because that's what it was.\\
312 - What it was was boring.\\
313 - Yeah, it was a lot better than SongSnatch.\\
314 - Whoa, hey!\\
315 - SongSnatch is catchy.\\
316 - Oh, yeah, so is herpes!\\
317 - Why didn't we call it Herpes.com?!\\
318 - Because it was taken!\\
319 - Guys, guys, let's-let's bring it back, okay?\\
320 - Easy does it, guys.\\
321 - (sighs)\\
322 - Right.\\
323 - Sorry.\\
324 - So what did you end up calling it?\\
325 - Blungogo.\\
326 - How'd you come up with that?\\
327 - It was the sound that Billy was making\\
328 - when I was trying to choke him to death.\\
329 - (strained): Blungogo!\\
330 - I heard that, I knew that was the name.\\
331 - Yeah. Way to go, partner.\\
332 - Hey, if you hadn't been trying to kill me,\\
333 - it never would've come out of my mouth.\\
334 - You really think we can build this thing?\\
335 - If anybody can do it, it's us.\\
336 - All right, where would we start?\\
337 - Well, first thing, we'd go over\\
338 - the original design for the code,\\
339 - split it up into little chunks that can be handled\\
340 - by multiple parallel processors.\\
341 - Sounds good.\\
342 - Yeah, that's what I would do, yeah.\\
343 - Mm-hmm.\\
344 - Then we can start compiling the modules,\\
345 - testing them, see if we can get them to talk to each other.\\
346 - Yeah, exactly.\\
347 - No brainer.\\
348 - Maybe the way to start is I'll set up the testing sandbox,\\
349 - and you set up the I/O module,\\
350 - and then we'll just go from there.\\
351 - Good.\\
352 - What do I do?\\
353 - What can you do?\\
354 - Uh...\\
355 - I-I can make cookies.\\
356 - You like cookies?\\
357 - Anyway, it's a multi- billion-dollar idea\\
358 - that doesn't have a prayer\\
359 - unless I get these two guys together.\\
360 - And how do they thank me?\\
361 - They eat my cookies and send me to 7-Eleven\\
362 - for Red Bull and Hot Pockets.\\
363 - Aw. I got to tell you,\\
364 - my feelings are a little bit hurt.\\
365 - I mean, I thought Walden and I\\
366 - were, like, best friends, but it turns out,\\
367 - this Billy guy is really his best friend.\\
368 - Well, old friends are hard to compete with.\\
369 - Yeah.\\
370 - The sad thing is I don't really have any old friends.\\
371 - What about the people you went to school with?\\
372 - My social life at school was mostly running and hiding.\\
373 - Summer camp?\\
374 - Oh, I still get Christmas cards\\
375 - from this one counselor who's in prison.\\
376 - Prison?\\
377 - Pedophile.\\
378 - Ew.\\
379 - So, what happened to your girlfriend?\\
380 - Oh, she's on vacation.\\
381 - Oh, where'd she go?\\
382 - Wouldn't say.\\
383 - It's kind of a vacation from me.\\
384 - So what you're saying is there's absolutely no one in your life\\
385 - who you consider a close friend?\\
386 - I don't count.\\
387 - Well, there is one person I have a lot of history with.\\
388 - Hey, pal, what's up?\\
389 - * Men. *\\
390 - Hey, don't forget to declare the routine global.\\
391 - Yeah, do I look like my e-mail address is at AOL.com?\\
392 - Man, I've had to pee for, like, an hour.\\
393 - I've had to pee for two hours.\\
394 - If you really have to go,\\
395 - there's a bathroom down the hallway.\\
396 - Oh, hey, I can hold it.\\
397 - If you have to use it though, go right ahead.\\
398 - Oh, no, I can hold it.\\
399 - All right, fine.\\
400 - You really are a competitive son of a bitch, aren't you?\\
401 - Hey, don't rag on me just 'cause you have a girlie bladder.\\
402 - We'll see who's got the girlie bladder.\\
403 - Oh, okay. Well, all right.\\
404 - (coughs)\\
405 - (sighs)\\
406 - (singsongy): I don't have to cross my legs.\\
407 - I don't have to cross my legs, either.\\
408 - You know what, I think I'm going to\\
409 - print this routine as a backup.\\
410 - Control... P.\\
411 - That's a good idea.\\
412 - I think I'm gonna print up all of my routines.\\
413 - P-P-P...\\
414 - P-P... P...\\
415 - P-P! P...\\
416 - * Men. *\\
417 - Soup?\\
418 - Why'd you bring me soup?\\
419 - 'Cause you're sick.\\
420 - Oh, right.\\
421 - (coughs)\\
422 - Thank you.\\
423 - And let's face it,\\
424 - friends should take care of each other.\\
425 - We're friends?\\
426 - Oh, come on, Berta.\\
427 - How many years have we known each other?\\
428 - That-That's got to count for something.\\
429 - You have been in my life longer than both my husbands\\
430 - and most of my underwear.\\
431 - Come here, friend.\\
432 - Now we're hugging friends.\\
433 - Those hands start to wander, this friendship is over.\\
434 - (doorbell rings)\\
435 - Excuse me.\\
436 - You know, that's-that's what I love about you.\\
437 - You know, the salty sense of humor,\\
438 - poking fun at me.\\
439 - That's the glue that binds us together.\\
440 - Right.\\
441 - Gracias.\\
442 - Adios.\\
443 - What was that?\\
444 - It's Mexican Halloween.\\
445 - So, listen, friend, I wonder if you'd do me a little favor.\\
446 - Uh, sure, name it.\\
447 - I need you to go to this address,\\
448 - ask for Shermie and give him this envelope.\\
449 - Oh, happy to.\\
450 - No one else, only Shermie.\\
451 - Okay.\\
452 - Who's Shermie?\\
453 - Just a guy I owe some money to.\\
454 - So this is the money.\\
455 - Most of it.\\
456 - (both grunting)\\
457 - (gasping): Ow! Oh! Okay...\\
458 - (sighs)\\
459 - Okay.\\
460 - (both sighing)\\
461 - Sometimes peeing's better than sex.\\
462 - Absolutely.\\
463 - Although, when I was smoking crack,\\
464 - a lot of times peeing and sex were the same thing.\\
465 - Hey, uh, while we're on the subject...\\
466 - What, peeing?\\
467 - No, sex.\\
468 - Something you should know.\\
469 - About sex?\\
470 - I think I'm okay.\\
471 - Yeah, we've all seen the python.\\
472 - What can I tell you, it's factory equipment.\\
473 - Right, great, no.\\
474 - It's about your ex-wife.\\
475 - What, Bridget?\\
476 - Yeah, I'm, uh... kinda sleeping with her.\\
477 - What?!\\
478 - Hey, watch where you're pointing that thing!\\
479 - When did this start?\\
480 - Well, you know I always had a thing for her.\\
481 - And when you guys broke up, I took her out, you know,\\
482 - gave her a shoulder to cry on,\\
483 - and she just kind of worked her way down.\\
484 - So when she called me about you...?\\
485 - I was there.\\
486 - Oh, man.\\
487 - Hey, I wasn't listening.\\
488 - Her thighs were covering my ears.\\
489 - Oh, you son of a bitch!\\
490 - Hey! Okay, okay!\\
491 - Hey, hey, hey!\\
492 - Hey! Don't! Don't!\\
493 - I swear to God, Shermie!\\
494 - That's all she gave me!\\
495 - Oh, crap, oh, crap, oh, crap, oh, crap.\\
496 - Ah.\\
497 - (tires screeching)\\
498 - Oh, crap, oh, crap.\\
499 - (screams)\\
500 - * Men. *\\
501 - You still mad about me and Bridget?\\
502 - I hate your guts.\\
503 - Good, that's what I was going for.\\
504 - Hey.\\
505 - What... what happened to your pants?\\
506 - Uh, I had a little accident.\\
507 - Um...\\
508 - Why are you wearing robes?\\
509 - Uh, we had a little accident, too.\\
510 - (laughs)\\
511 - H-H-How are you guys doing?\\
512 - Oh, hey, we're good, man.\\
513 - We're about to, uh, about to test the first module.\\
514 - Walden, would you do the honors?\\
515 - Oh, no, please.\\
516 - No, it was your vision.\\
517 - Yeah, but it was your expertise.\\
518 - Yeah, but I'm banging your ex-wife.\\
519 - All the while wondering if she misses the python.\\
520 - Press the damn button.\\
521 - Fine.\\
522 - Behold the birth\\
523 - of The Stanhope-Schmidt Electric Suitcase.\\
524 - (gasps) Yes! Yes!\\
525 - (both laugh)\\
526 - That's it?\\
527 - I mean, I have an iPhone app\\
528 - that'll turn out the house lights.\\
529 - No, no, no, no. It's much more than that.\\
530 - Name a state.\\
531 - Engorged.\\
532 - Oh, okay.\\
533 - Uh, Florida.\\
534 - (tapping keys)\\
535 - (Walden chuckles)\\
536 - ALAN: Okay, I'm-I'm sorry, guys,\\
537 - I just don't get it.\\
538 - I'm going to bed.\\
539 - BILLY: Oh, try Canada.\\
540 - WALDEN: Lights "oot."\\
541 - (taps a key)\\
542 - (Billy and Walden laugh)\\
543 - BILLY: Okay, now... the master switch.\\
544 - (taps a key)\\
545 - BILLY and WALDEN: Awesome!\\

1 - I miss you, too, but what are you doing up?\\
2 - Isn't it, like, 3:00 in the morning in London?\\
3 - Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping, too.\\
4 - Alan suggested warm milk and masturbation,\\
5 - but that's his answer for pretty much everything.\\
6 - No, don't worry.\\
7 - He's not gonna live here forever.\\
8 - More importantly, uh, when are you coming back?\\
9 - Ugh! Really, another week?\\
10 - All right, that settles it.\\
11 - I'm gonna heat up some milk.\\
12 - Okay, all right.\\
13 - Try to get some sleep.\\
14 - I love you.\\
15 - No, I love you more.\\
16 - No, uh-uh, I love you more.\\
17 - You got a problem with love?\\
18 - Uh-uh. No, no.\\
19 - Sorry.\\
20 - Oh, it's Jake and his friend.\\
21 - No, he's not gonna stay here forever, either.\\
22 - All right, bye-bye. Sweet dreams.\\
23 - Sorry, we'll get out of your way.\\
24 - Nah, that's okay.\\
25 - What are you guys doing?\\
26 - Well, we were gonna play a video game\\
27 - on the big screen, but if you're busy...\\
28 - No, no, come on.\\
29 - Nice. Awesome.\\
30 - Where's your dad?\\
31 - Oh, he's out with this guy's mom.\\
32 - Yeah, they're picking my grandma up\\
33 - at the International House of Old People.\\
34 - I-Hoop.\\
35 - She's in a rest home?\\
36 - I guess they're resting.\\
37 - They don't move very much.\\
38 - Oh, except on pudding day.\\
39 - Uh, then you could get trampled.\\
40 - Wow. Your dad's meeting his girlfriend's mother.\\
41 - That's a big step.\\
42 - What's bigger than boning each other?\\
43 - Shut up!\\
44 - Come on. We both know they're doing it.\\
45 - - We've heard them. - Dude!\\
46 - Oh, Alan! Oh, Lyndsey!\\
47 - Okay, quit it, or I'm leaving.\\
48 - Okay, fine.\\
49 - And I'm taking my game.\\
50 - I apologize. Accepted.\\
51 - It's nice you guys have a sense of humor about that stuff.\\
52 - So many kids of divorce are, like, so angry all the time.\\
53 - Yeah, well, it's kind of hard to stay angry\\
54 - when you smoke as much pot as we do.\\
55 - Truth.\\
56 - When my dad left, I was, like, really angry.\\
57 - What did you do?\\
58 - Just channeled my energy\\
59 - into learning how to program computers.\\
60 - Made my first million by the time I was 20.\\
61 - - Oh, that's our plan, too. - Totally.\\
62 - Really? What language do you guys code in?\\
63 - Java? Perl? C-Plus-Plus?\\
64 - Um...\\
65 - Okay, maybe not a million.\\
66 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
67 -     Ah.     Men.\\

70 - You're in a good mood.\\
71 - I am.\\
72 - Looking forward to seeing your mother?\\
73 - Not at all.\\
74 - I'm high as a kite.\\
75 - If I'm looking forward to anything,\\
76 - it's for that second muscle relaxer to kick in.\\
77 - I hear you. Unfortunately, I can't do that with my mom.\\
78 - I have to stay alert.\\
79 - Dinner with her is like being trapped in a box with a snake.\\
80 - My mom's more like a hamster.\\
81 - They seem cuddly, but they eat their young.\\
82 - Can't wait to meet her.\\
83 - Oh, you'll love her.\\
84 - Everybody loves her.\\
85 - She's sweet, shy and charming.\\
86 - Unless you happened to come out of her uterus,\\
87 - then you're part of a balanced breakfast.\\
88 - That bad, huh?\\
89 - Yeah, and it's gotten worse since my dad died.\\
90 - Oh, she must have loved him very much.\\
91 - Nah, hated his guts.\\
92 - She tried to kill him once.\\
93 - You're kidding.\\
94 - Yeah, they were playing golf.\\
95 - He gave her a swing tip.\\
96 - She hit him on the head with a pitching wedge.\\
97 - A-a pitching wedge?\\
98 - It was the right club.\\
99 - They were about 90 yards out.\\
100 - Anyway, when he finally died years later,\\
101 - she decided he was the love of her life,\\
102 - moved into a retirement community,\\
103 - and put a "gone fishing sign" on her hoo-ha.\\
104 - Okay, guess I shouldn't mention golf during dinner.\\
105 - Mm.\\
106 - Or fishing.\\
107 - Yeah. You might also want to stay away from politics,\\
108 - religion or The Price Is Right.\\
109 - The Price Is Right?\\
110 - She misses Bob Barker.\\
111 - Hates Drew Carey.\\
112 - Oh, really?\\
113 - I think he's a wonderful breath of fresh air.\\
114 - Do not say that.\\
115 -     Men.\\
116 - See, he's right behind you!\\
117 - Ah! He's right behind you!\\
118 - Move! Move! Duck!\\
119 - Ah, ah, don't worry, Junior. I got this!\\
120 - Aah, crap.\\
121 - Watch and learn.\\
122 - Man, I used to be a lot better at this.\\
123 - I guess I'm just out of practice.\\
124 - That's 'cause you got a girlfriend now.\\
125 - Yeah. Your thumbs have gotten weak.\\
126 - That's why I choose to be a bachelor.\\
127 - Yeah, that's why.\\
128 - So, what's the deal with you and Zoey?\\
129 - Are you gonna marry her?\\
130 - I don't know. I mean, I love her and all,\\
131 - but I just got out of a marriage.\\
132 - Do I really want to be back in one?\\
133 - Hell, yeah. She's hot.\\
134 - It's not about how hot she is.\\
135 - Oh, thank you, Jake.\\
136 - It's about whether she stays hot.\\
137 - I mean, plus, there's some serious stuff to consider.\\
138 - She has a daughter, so I'd be a stepdad.\\
139 - My stepdad's a pretty cool guy.\\
140 - I mean, he's always slipping me money.\\
141 - I think he feels bad about replacing my dad.\\
142 - Or about banging your mom.\\
143 - Shut up!\\
144 - Mm, doesn't feel so good, does it?\\
145 - That's what your mom said.\\
146 - All right, can we please talk about something other than sex?\\
147 - Yes. Okay.\\
148 - But for the record, I'm not a virgin.\\
149 - Good to know.\\
150 - Neither am I.\\
151 - At least I think I'm not.\\
152 - It was dark.\\
153 - Could have been just leg.\\
154 - But that still counts.\\
155 - No, it doesn't.\\
156 - Right?\\
157 - Listen, if he thinks he got laid,\\
158 - what difference does it make?\\
159 - Thank you.\\
160 -     Men.\\
161 - Mom, this is Alan.\\
162 - Alan, this is my mom Jean.\\
163 - Hi. Nice to meet you.\\
164 - How are you?\\
165 - Uh, good, good.\\
166 - Although I-I got to admit, I'm-I'm a little nervous.\\
167 - You know, I hope Mom likes me, you know?\\
168 - Relax, Alan.\\
169 - When it comes to men,\\
170 - Lyndsey has never set the bar very high.\\
171 - What's that supposed to mean?\\
172 - I'm just saying that you've always gone\\
173 - for quantity over quality.\\
174 - It's a choice. I'm not judging.\\
175 - Oh.\\
176 - Come on, muscle relaxers.\\
177 - So, Alan, do you have children?\\
178 - Uh, I do. I have a son. Mm.\\
179 - That's good,\\
180 - 'cause even if Lyndsey could bear another child,\\
181 - I'm not sure that would be the smartest move.\\
182 - Mom!\\
183 - Tell the truth.\\
184 - Do you want another one like Eldridge?\\
185 - Let's just change the subject.\\
186 - Does anybody want another Eldridge?\\
187 - How are things at Sunset Village?\\
188 - Same old, same old.\\
189 - Well, actually, some of the same old died,\\
190 - so we got some new old.\\
191 - Oh, th's awful.\\
192 - Not really.\\
193 - If you get to their condo before the relatives,\\
194 - you can score some great stuff.\\
195 - Oh, Mom, you're not saying...\\
196 - How do you think I got this lovely sweater?\\
197 - It certainly wasn't a Mother's Day gift.\\
198 - Well, uh,\\
199 - if it comes up, I'm a 40 regular.\\
200 - So, Mom, do you want to do anything special this weekend?\\
201 - I'll be happy doing whatever you want.\\
202 - Oh, well, I-I thought maybe tomorrow we could have lunch\\
203 - at the Santa Monica Pier, then go for a walk on the beach.\\
204 - Oh, okay.\\
205 - We don't have to.\\
206 - No, that's fine.\\
207 - I'm not afraid of homeless people.\\
208 - You know, your daughter's a good lady.\\
209 - You did a great job with her, Jean.\\
210 - Thanks.\\
211 - But it was touch and go for a while.\\
212 - She told you about her show business career, right?\\
213 - Seriously, Mom? Really?\\
214 - What? It was a very nice movie--\\
215 - if you like pornography.\\
216 - Okay, I-I saw it, and-and it wasn't pornography.\\
217 - Well, it wasn't Mary Poppins.\\
218 - So,\\
219 - you guys graduate this year, right?\\
220 - I do.\\
221 - I do, too.\\
222 - Well, that's what you said last year.\\
223 - Yeah, but now, they're one more year sicker of me.\\
224 - So what are you gonna do now?\\
225 - Well, we were hoping we could work for you.\\
226 - Doing what?\\
227 - We'd be, like, consultants.\\
228 - And what would you be consulting about?\\
229 - Well, that would be our first consultation.\\
230 - How about this?\\
231 - We could tell you what kids these days are into\\
232 - and then develop killer apps to target that geographic.\\
233 - Demographic.\\
234 - No, Republican kids, too.\\
235 - Mm.\\
236 - All right, Consultants,\\
237 - tell me some of your app ideas.\\
238 - Okay, well, you know, uh,\\
239 - when you take a picture of your junk and send it to a girl?\\
240 - Um... no.\\
241 - But I understand the concept.\\
242 - Okay, okay, well, this app makes your junk look bigger.\\
243 - And you can customize it.\\
244 - You can customize your junk?\\
245 - Yeah, you know, like silly hats,\\
246 - glasses, little messages.\\
247 - "Wish you were here."\\
248 - Get it? Get it?\\
249 - Yeah, I get it.\\
250 - So, it's like Photoshop, but for your junk.\\
251 - We call it Junkshop.\\
252 - It's a good name.\\
253 - What do you do if you already got big junk?\\
254 - Oh, way ahead of you. Tell him about Boobshop.\\
255 - All right, you know how girls always complain\\
256 - about one boob being bigger than the other?\\
257 - Oh, thank God, she's asleep.\\
258 - I don't think I can last four days.\\
259 - Every word out of her mouth pushes my buttons.\\
260 - Yeah, I saw. She's like a ninja mom.\\
261 - She sneaks in, destroys your will to live,\\
262 - and then, disappears without a trace.\\
263 - So I'm not crazy?\\
264 - Oh, no, not at all. Oh.\\
265 - In fact, it kind of makes me grateful for my mom.\\
266 - What do you mean?\\
267 - Well, there's no sneaking\\
268 - and stabbing in the back.\\
269 - She just walks right up to you,\\
270 - and hits you in the face with a lead pipe.\\
271 - I wonder what would happen\\
272 - if we put them in the same room together.\\
273 - Uh. Momageddon.\\
274 - Although... it wouldn't be the worst idea in the world.\\
275 - What?!\\
276 - Well, think about it.\\
277 - They're around the same age, they're single,\\
278 - they're both deeply disappointed in their children\\
279 - and their children's children.\\
280 - They might hit it off.\\
281 - And if they did, it might give us a break.\\
282 - You know what? Tell you what--\\
283 - I will call my mom and try to set up a dinner.\\
284 - Oh, Alan,\\
285 - that would be wonderful. Mm.\\
286 - I owe you one.\\
287 - You still owe me one from my birthday.\\
288 - Well...\\
289 - if she wasn't here, I'd be steering this car\\
290 - with the back of my head right now.\\
291 - Looks like she's sleeping pretty good.\\
292 - Oh, what the hell? Scoot your seat back.\\
293 - Yay!\\
294 -     Men.\\
295 - Hey, what you doing?\\
296 - Absolutely nothing.\\
297 - I'm bored out of my mind.\\
298 - Oh, well, Lyndsey and I are having dinner with our moms.\\
299 - You're welcome to join us.\\
300 - A two-mom dinner?\\
301 - You can say no.\\
302 - No. God, no.\\
303 - I get you.\\
304 - I don't want to go, either.\\
305 - Why are you doing it?\\
306 - Are you thinking about getting married?\\
307 - Um, to answer your questions in reverse order:\\
308 - not at the moment and oral sex.\\
309 - Night.\\
310 - Oral sex.\\
311 - Time to warm up the old milk.\\
312 - Oh, great, Amy.\\
313 - We'll be there.\\
314 - What's going on?\\
315 - Just got invited\\
316 - to a slammin' party in the Valley.\\
317 - Cool.\\
318 - Can we borrow your car?\\
319 - Uh, all right, let me think.\\
320 - Two potheads want to borrow my $100,000 car\\
321 - to go to a slammin' party in the Valley.\\
322 - Sounds like a no.\\
323 - Wait, wait, wait.\\
324 - Let's hear him out.\\
325 - It's a no!\\
326 - I'll give you guys a ride.\\
327 - - Oh, sweet. - Thanks.\\
328 - What you got going on with the water?\\
329 - Oh, we had another idea for an app.\\
330 - Let me guess-- Sinkshop.\\
331 - Oh, no, no.\\
332 - Okay, imagine the app is on my phone.\\
333 - - All right. - Go ahead.\\
334 - Now, all I do\\
335 - is press this button, and our app will tell you\\
336 - exactly how long you can hold your breath underwater.\\
337 - That's clever.\\
338 - Thanks.\\
339 - How is it different than the stopwatch\\
340 - that's already on your phone?\\
341 - The what?\\
342 - See this little clock?\\
343 - Oh.\\
344 - Damn.\\
345 - How long?\\
346 - So this is nice, huh?\\
347 - Lovely.\\
348 - I can't remember how long it's been\\
349 - since the last time you called me to have dinner.\\
350 - Oh, come on. It hasn't been that long.\\
351 - Oh, please. Jake was still cute.\\
352 - Guess it has been awhile.\\
353 - So what's up with this dinner?\\
354 - Why are you finally allowing me to meet your girlfriend?\\
355 - First of all, I wasn't disallowing you\\
356 - from meeting her; I was just, uh...\\
357 - avoiding it as long as possible.\\
358 - Uh, but things are more serious between us now,\\
359 - and I thought it might be nice\\
360 - for you two to get to know each other.\\
361 - - All right. - And her mother might come along.\\
362 - Her mother?\\
363 - Yeah, she's, uh, in town visiting.\\
364 - I thought you two might hit it off.\\
365 - Alan, you know I don't like old people.\\
366 - I do know, but you'll like her.\\
367 - She's young at heart, like you.\\
368 - I'm young everywhere-- all the parts.\\
369 - Sure.\\
370 - What I haven't replaced,\\
371 - I've had tightened, bleached or trimmed.\\
372 - Got it.\\
373 - So where's the old biddy live?\\
374 - Palmdale.\\
375 - Palmdale, ech.\\
376 - Is she married?\\
377 - Uh, widow.\\
378 - How'd her husband die?\\
379 - Heart attack.\\
380 - Boring.\\
381 - She did actually try to kill him once.\\
382 - Oh.\\
383 - Well, at least we have something in common.\\
384 - Sure you gave me the right address?\\
385 - Yeah.\\
386 - 1478 Amy Lane.\\
387 - Wait a sec.\\
388 - Isn't Amy Lane the name of the chick having the party?\\
389 - It may not be Amy Lane.\\
390 - But we're on Amy Lane.\\
391 - An amazing coincidence, huh?\\
392 - Is there somebody you guys can call?\\
393 - I mean, I can call Amy Lane.\\
394 - If that is, in fact, her real name.\\
395 - Evelyn, Alan tells me you do a lot of traveling.\\
396 - Yes. I love it.\\
397 - The classical architecture, the exotic cuisine,\\
398 - the uncircumcised men.\\
399 - Although one could make a case\\
400 - that falls under "exotic cuisine."\\
401 - Just like you and Alan in the car.\\
402 - Do you guys travel much?\\
403 - Not anymore.\\
404 - But when my husband was alive, we went everywhere.\\
405 - Six Flags, Epcot, Dollywood.\\
406 - Charming.\\
407 - Real globe-trotter.\\
408 - Speaking of which, I once slept with Meadowlark Lemon.\\
409 - Let me tell you,\\
410 - basketballs weren't the only thing he could spin.\\
411 - I'm so sorry.\\
412 - I hope this is it.\\
413 - They have a balloon on the mailbox\\
414 - that says party. Mm.\\
415 - Yeah?\\
416 - Uh, is this where the party is?\\
417 - Oh, you saw the balloon, huh?\\
418 - Come on in.\\
419 - Okay. Oh, hang on.\\
420 - Hang on. Excuse us.\\
421 - Don't you pay attention in health class?\\
422 - What are you talking about?\\
423 - Stranger danger.\\
424 - No, he seems okay.\\
425 - You guys like to wrestle?\\
426 - Let's book it, dude.\\
427 - Yeah. Walden! Don't go!\\
428 - Always a bridesmaid.\\
429 - Really, Alan?\\
430 - Why don't I get this?\\
431 - Well, you got to admit my plan worked.\\
432 - They hit it off and left us pretty much unscathed.\\
433 - Plus, thanks to your mom, my mom can now go back\\
434 - to her retirement community and show all her girlfriends\\
435 - what happens when you Google "Santorum."\\
436 - Lyndsey, will you take me to get a tramp stamp?\\
437 - What?\\
438 - It's a cute little tattoo right here.\\
439 - Evelyn has one.\\
440 - You do?\\
441 - I got it in Singapore.\\
442 - The Chinese characters for: "Thank you. Come again."\\
443 - All right, well, we're done here.\\
444 - Why don't we head home?\\
445 - I don't want to go home.\\
446 - Evelyn says there's a place right down the street\\
447 - where they have music and dancing.\\
448 - Oh, I don't think so. It's getting kind of late.\\
449 - Yeah, we both have to work in the morning.\\
450 - I don't.\\
451 - Neither do I.\\
452 - Why don't you two fuddy-duddies run along\\
453 - and let Jean and I have some fun?\\
454 - How will you get home?\\
455 - Alan, I made it from Brunei to Morocco with nothing\\
456 - but the clothes on my back and a tube of lubricant.\\
457 - I think I can get us from Tarzana to Sherman Oaks.\\
458 - Isn't she a hoot?\\
459 - All right, if you're sure.\\
460 - Let's go.\\
461 - You think we'll find some cute fellas to dance with?\\
462 - Oh, Jean, Jean, Jean.\\
463 - We're not going to dance.\\
464 -     Men.\\
465 - Should have written the address down, dude.\\
466 - I did write it down.\\
467 - She must have told it to me wrong.\\
468 - Or maybe you heard it wrong.\\
469 - If only there was an app that could capture the spoken word.\\
470 - If only there was an app that could capture the spoken word.\\
471 - Don't mock us, man.\\
472 - Don't mock us, man.\\
473 - Hi, Jake.\\
474 - Hi, Eldridge.\\
475 - - Hey. - Hi.\\
476 - I bet they were at the party.\\
477 - Yeah, maybe they can tell us where it is.\\
478 - Oh, good thinking.\\
479 - I'll text 'em.\\
480 - Wait, I don't have their numbers.\\
481 - Man, we're never going to find this party.\\
482 - Okay.\\
483 - Let me ask you a question.\\
484 - If you had made it to the party, what would you have done there?\\
485 - Try to hook up with some chicks.\\
486 - Why don't you hook up with them?\\
487 - Right there-- that's why you're rich.\\
488 - Would you mind very much if we, you know, blew you off?\\
489 - I would worry about you if you didn't.\\
490 - - Bye. - Later.\\
491 - Hello, ladies.\\
492 - Mind if we hook up with you?\\
493 -     Men.\\
494 - Morning. Morning.\\
495 - Oh, morning.\\
496 - You and Evelyn have a good time last night?\\
497 - Fantastic. Mm.\\
498 - I adore your mother.\\
499 - That's only because you just met her.\\
500 - I don't know, I think I got to know her pretty well.\\
501 - Good morning, darling.\\
502 - Hi, Peaches.\\
503 - Once again, I'm so, so sorry.\\

1 - Previously on:\\
2 - Billy called.\\
3 - Billy Stanhope?\\
4 - Yeah, he said he has a business proposition for you.\\
5 - How 'bout that?\\
6 - Billy Stanhope... (laughs)\\
7 - (screaming)\\
8 - (screams)\\
9 - What went down between you two?\\
10 - Well, we built Eddie's software company in Bridget's garage\\
11 - and then sold it for a couple billion dollars.\\
12 - That son of a bitch.\\
13 - He didn't want to sell.\\
14 - You really think we can finally build the electric suitcase?\\
15 - Yes, we have the technology now.\\
16 - I-I just need you to help me write the code.\\
17 - Hey, you know, while we're on the subject...\\
18 - What? Peeing? No, sex.\\
19 - There's something you should know.\\
20 - It's about your ex-wife.\\
21 - What? Bridget?\\
22 - Yeah, I'm, uh...\\
23 - kind of sleeping with her.\\
24 - What?! W-Wait, hey...\\
25 - Mom, this is Alan.\\
26 - Alan, this is my mom, Jean.\\
27 - Hi. Nice to meet you.\\
28 - You know what? Tell you what.\\
29 - I will call my mom and try to set up a dinner.\\
30 - Evelyn says there's a place right down the street\\
31 - where they have music and dancing.\\
32 - Why don't you two fuddy-duddies run along\\
33 - and let Jean and I have some fun.\\
34 - You think we'll find some cute fellas to dance with?\\
35 - Oh, Jean, Jean, Jean...\\
36 - we're not going to dance.\\
37 - I adore your mother.\\
38 - That's only because you just met her.\\
39 - I don't know.\\
40 - I think I got to know her pretty well.\\
41 - Good morning, darling.\\
42 - Hi, Peaches.\\
43 -     Men...   \\
44 - Great. I'll pick you up at the airport.\\
45 - I can't wait.\\
46 - I love you, too.\\
47 - Tell Zoey I said "hi."\\
48 - Oh, Alan says "hi."\\
49 - (quietly) Yes, he's still here.\\
50 - Uh-huh. I know. You're right.\\
51 - She says "hi" back.\\
52 - Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.\\
53 - Here you go.\\
54 - Oh, thank you.\\
55 - You got to be excited about having your girlfriend back.\\
56 - What has it been, a month? Three weeks.\\
57 - Still, that's like a decade in penis years.\\
58 - Yeah.\\
59 - Tell you the truth, I'm actually a little bit worried.\\
60 - About your relationship?\\
61 - Come on. Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\\
62 - At least for guys like you.\\
63 - For guys like me, absence is more often enforced\\
64 - by the state of California.\\
65 - Zoey doesn't know that I started a new software company\\
66 - with my old partner.\\
67 - Yeah, with Billy, I know. What's the big deal?\\
68 - Well, there's a third partner...\\
69 - that Zoey's not gonna like.\\
70 - Walden...\\
71 - you made me a partner?\\
72 - All I did was bring you two guys together,\\
73 - The third partner is Bridget.\\
74 - Your ex-wife?\\
75 - Come on, I brought you two guys together!\\
76 - But she helped me design the original code\\
77 - for the software; I had to bring her in.\\
78 - Oh, right, right.\\
79 - Well, I guess that would make a very awkward conversation\\
80 - with Zoey.\\
81 - Yeah. I think I'm just gonna try\\
82 - to slip it in without her noticing.\\
83 - Hmm. Story of my life.\\
84 - (sighs)\\
85 - Well, listen, just remember,\\
86 - that love will get you through times of no money\\
87 - better than money will get you through times of no love.\\
88 - That's good advice.\\
89 - Thank you.\\
90 - And, uh, just to be clear...\\
91 - uh, I have zero stake\\
92 - in this potential billion-dollar business?\\
93 - Well, actually, I was gonna give you\\
94 - a hundred shares of founders' stock.\\
95 - Wow.\\
96 - If this thing works, it could be worth millions.\\
97 - Thank you.\\
98 - My problem is I still got to figure out\\
99 - how to explain this to Zoey.\\
100 - Dump the bitch. Don't let her screw this up for us.\\
101 - Once again, thank you for the advice.\\
102 - Well, if it makes you feel any better,\\
103 - I've got my own little relationship problem brewing.\\
104 - Yeah, that doesn't make me feel better.\\
105 - My girlfriend's mom and my mom\\
106 - have become lovers.\\
107 - (laughs): Okay, that does make me feel better.\\

118 - Can I ask you a question? What?\\
119 - If we just had sex in England,\\
120 - would I be lying on the other side of the bed?\\
121 - (laughs)\\
122 - Oh, God, I've missed you.\\
123 - I missed you, too.\\
124 - And you can call me Walden.\\
125 - (laughing)\\
126 - So, what have you been up to?\\
127 - Actually, I've been, like, very, very busy.\\
128 - With what?\\
129 - I started a new software company\\
130 - with my old partner Billy Stanhope.\\
131 - (gasps) Walden!\\
132 - Yeah. That's terrific!\\
133 - It's amazing and, and\\
134 - we built this amazing product.\\
135 - It's called the electric suitcase.\\
136 - I-It's gonna completely revolutionize\\
137 - the global energy market.\\
138 - Whoa. Sounds big.\\
139 - No, it's bigger than big. I mean, the three of us\\
140 - could end up splitting billions of dollars.\\
141 - The three of you?\\
142 - What?\\
143 - You just said the three of you.\\
144 - Y-Yes, there are in fact three of us.\\
145 - Who's the third?\\
146 - Oh, not Alan.\\
147 - (laughs) No, God, no.\\
148 - So, who is it?\\
149 - It's Bridget.\\
150 - Your ex-wife?\\
151 - There's nothing I could do.\\
152 - I mean, she helped write the original code for the software\\
153 - so she still owns a third of it.\\
154 - So you've gone into business with a woman\\
155 - who drove her car into your living room\\
156 - because you chose me over her?\\
157 - Crazy world, huh?\\
158 - On the plus side...\\
159 - s-she's sleeping with my ex-partner. So...\\
160 - Why is that a plus side?\\
161 - B-Because she's with him,\\
162 - so you don't have to worry about me and... her.\\
163 - I wasn't worried about you and her.\\
164 - Good.\\
165 - Until just now.\\
166 - Why didn't you tell me about this before we had sex?\\
167 - Do you want to have sex now?\\
168 - No! That's why!\\
169 - I'm going home.\\
170 - Oh, come on, Zoey.\\
171 - Don't make a big deal out of this.\\
172 - If I told you I was going into business with my ex-husband\\
173 - would you consider it a big deal?\\
174 - No, not at all.\\
175 - You're a liar.\\
176 - (groans)\\
177 - Life would be so much easier if I dated dumb chicks.\\
178 - I heard that.\\
179 - It was a compliment.\\
180 - Here you go.\\
181 - Thank you. So..\\
182 - have you given any thought as to what we're gonna do\\
183 - about our little... mother situation?\\
184 - Golden Girls Gone Wild?\\
185 - Hey... what can we do? They're grown woman.\\
186 - They've made a lifestyle choice.\\
187 - I have no problem with the lifestyle.\\
188 - I've tried the lifestyle.\\
189 - Really?! When?\\
190 - Who? College? Camp?\\
191 - Shut up, Alan.\\
192 - Sorry. Go ahead.\\
193 - How am I supposed to have a relationship with you\\
194 - when your mother is clearly taking sexual advantage of mine?\\
195 - H-Hang on a second.\\
196 - I don't think anyone is taking advantage of anyone.\\
197 - You don't?\\
198 - A week ago my mother was living in a retirement community\\
199 - playing golf with her girlfriends\\
200 - and watching reruns of Cagney & Lacey.\\
201 - Well, I don't know.\\
202 - Golf, Cagney & Lacey...\\
203 - Sounds like she was already halfway there.\\
204 - Shut up, Alan.\\
205 - (both laughing)\\
206 - Oh, good, you're here.\\
207 - Mom!\\
208 - What have you done to yourself?\\
209 - Evelyn took me shopping.\\
210 - Do you like my new look?\\
211 - Isn't she gorgeous?\\
212 - Yeah, I-I guess.\\
213 - We also got matching tattoos.\\
214 - Oh, Mom, no.\\
215 - See? It's a little heart.\\
216 - Uh, with an "E plus J" in it.\\
217 - I don't see one on your ankle, Mom.\\
218 - It's not on my ankle.\\
219 - Oh, glory-oski.\\
220 - Mom, you've been gone all day.\\
221 - I thought you and I were gonna spend some time together\\
222 - before you went back to Sunset Village.\\
223 - I know. I'm sorry, sweetheart.\\
224 - We've been so busy.\\
225 - But don't worry.\\
226 - You're gonna be seeing a lot more of me\\
227 - after I move in with Evy.\\
228 - What?\\
229 - I've got this huge place.\\
230 - Why shouldn't she enjoy it?\\
231 - You're talking about your huge house, right?\\
232 - We're just gonna pick up some things here\\
233 - and then go close up Jean's condo.\\
234 - And then we'll start our new life,\\
235 - right, Peaches? That's right, Pumpkin.\\
236 - Come on.\\
237 - This sort of makes you brother and sister, doesn't it?\\
238 - Is it just me or is... that idea kind of a turn-on?\\
239 - (laughs): It's just me.\\
240 -     Men...   \\
241 - WALDEN: Oh, come on. It's not that weird.\\
242 - Yeah, because we have a child together.\\
243 - Okay, well, Bridget and I have a business together.\\
244 - It's basically the same thing.\\
245 - Have you been sniffing glue?\\
246 - No! They both require nurturing and attention.\\
247 - The only difference is your kid's gonna cost you a fortune\\
248 - and mine is gonna make a fortune.\\
249 - Wow. Good-bye.\\
250 - Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
251 - J-Just...\\
252 - do one thing for me. What?\\
253 - Let's the three of us have dinner together.\\
254 - You want me to have dinner with you and your ex-wife?\\
255 - Yes.\\
256 - That way you can see that everything is cool between us.\\
257 - Come on, Zoey. This is really important to me.\\
258 - (sighs)\\
259 - God, I'm gonna regret this.\\
260 - One dinner.\\
261 - Thank you.\\
262 - I will see you tomorrow.\\
263 - Good-bye.\\
264 - (groans): Well done, old boy.\\
265 - You dodged the crazy girlfriend bullet.\\
266 - ZOEY: Walden, I'm still outside the door.\\
267 - You didn't let me finish.\\
268 - All right, finish.\\
269 - I love you so much.\\
270 -     Men...   \\
271 - Here you go.\\
272 - Thank you.\\
273 - So did you tell Zoey about working with Bridget?\\
274 - Uh, yeah.\\
275 - How'd it go?\\
276 - Not good.\\
277 - But she did agree to have dinner with us.\\
278 - W-Wait, you're having dinner\\
279 - with your girlfriend and your ex-wife?\\
280 - Bad idea?\\
281 - Well, not as bad as me trying to turn my girlfriend on\\
282 - with a little incest fantasy, but it's right up there.\\
283 - What else was I gonna do? Well, I...\\
284 - I'm not gonna dump the bitch. Okay.\\
285 - Fine, fine. We'll just keep our eyes on the prize here.\\
286 - What, your hundred shares in the company?\\
287 - I was more thinking about your happiness,\\
288 - but sure, there's that.\\
289 - Hey, uh, this might make you feel better.\\
290 - Uh, I'm having my own bad idea dinner.\\
291 - What's that?\\
292 - Lyndsey, her son, my son, and the two gay grandmas.\\
293 - Once again, that does make me feel better.\\
294 - (laughs)\\
295 - Hey, how about this?\\
296 - Why don't we meet back here\\
297 - after our respective dinners and compare notes?\\
298 - Sort of like a recap at the end of a reality show.\\
299 - Yeah. Yeah, we could, uh, you know, have a little contest.\\
300 - See whose dinner was worse.\\
301 - Shame we can't let America vote on it.\\
302 - (laughs)\\
303 - Yeah.\\
304 - Or can we?\\
305 -     Men.    \\
306 -     Men.    \\
307 - Hey, this is really nice, huh?\\
308 - Zoey, uh...\\
309 - (clears throat) Bridget and I\\
310 - were talking about your...\\
311 - ...your concerns, and\\
312 - Bridget was very eager to assuage them.\\
313 - Right, Bridge?\\
314 - Absolutely.\\
315 - Okay.\\
316 - Let the assuaging begin.\\
317 - Anybody?\\
318 - I'll take a crack at it.\\
319 - No, thank you, Berta.\\
320 - All right, obviously, this is an awkward situation.\\
321 - Walden and I were\\
322 - together for many, many years,\\
323 - and you and he have been dating for a few months now,\\
324 - so clearly, you're insecure about us working together.\\
325 - I am not insecure.\\
326 - Right, and there's no reason\\
327 - you should be. Yes,\\
328 - I've known this guy since high school,\\
329 - and yes, we fell in love,\\
330 - and yes, we spent many happy years together,\\
331 - but the reality now is, we're simply business partners.\\
332 - Right.\\
333 - And not all those years were happy.\\
334 - Oh, sure, there were some great times.\\
335 - Also, I want to build...\\
336 - But there were also some bad times.\\
337 - Also some bad times.\\
338 - I mean, the point is,\\
339 - is that our relationship now is just strictly business.\\
340 - Oh, speaking of which, we need to upgrade the ventilation\\
341 - for the server farm.\\
342 - Oh, that's a good idea.\\
343 - Oh, also, I want to build triple redundancy.\\
344 - Of course, but we shouldn't be talking shop\\
345 - and leaving poor Zoey out of the conversation.\\
346 - No, that's all right. I love to hear about Walden's work.\\
347 - Oh, that's so sweet.\\
348 - I'm so glad he found someone like you.\\
349 - Oh. Thank you.\\
350 - After I threw him out, I wondered how he'd survive.\\
351 - He's so needy.\\
352 - I'm not needy.\\
353 - Yeah, you are. BOTH: Yes, you are.\\
354 - So what's the deal?\\
355 - Are you guys in it for the long haul,\\
356 - or are you just gonna date and see what happens?\\
357 - Well, we're just finding our way for the moment.\\
358 - (clears throat) Oh, good.\\
359 - Mm. Good.\\
360 - Keep it casual.\\
361 - That way no one can accuse you of going after his money.\\
362 - Excuse me?\\
363 - I'm not after his money.\\
364 - Oh, no, you misunderstand.\\
365 - I... I'm sure you're not, but unfortunately,\\
366 - there's no way to prove it.\\
367 - Luckily, I met him when he had nothing,\\
368 - so there's no question about my intentions.\\
369 - Are you questioning my intentions?\\
370 - No, she's not. She's not.\\
371 - No, you're not. You're not, are you?\\
372 - Of course not.\\
373 - Are you questioning my intentions?\\
374 - Me? No!\\
375 - Berta, how is the pot roast coming?\\
376 - Got another 30 minutes.\\
377 - You guys keep chatting.\\
378 -     Men.    \\
379 - I don't understand.\\
380 - Why is my grandmother living with his grandmother?\\
381 - Yeah, I was kind of wondering that myself,\\
382 - but I didn't want to look stupid.\\
383 - Too late, dude.\\
384 - You want to handle this, Alan?\\
385 - Not really.\\
386 - I wasn't asking.\\
387 - All right. Um...\\
388 - Well, fellas, um,\\
389 - your two grandmas are, uh... are both very lonely,\\
390 - and so, they've, uh, decided to become...\\
391 - uh, roommates, uh,\\
392 - and keep each other company.\\
393 - Oh, that makes sense. Mm.\\
394 - Plus, if one of them falls down,\\
395 - the other can call the ambulance.\\
396 - What if they both fall down at the same time?\\
397 - Um, I guess they starve to death and die.\\
398 - Unless they go cannibal and try to eat each other.\\
399 - If that happens, I'm betting\\
400 - on my grandma eating your grandma.\\
401 - Dude, there's no way in the world\\
402 - that your grandma eats my grandma.\\
403 - My grandma totally eats your grandma.\\
404 - Nuh-uh. If any grandma's doing any eating, it's my grandma.\\
405 - ELDRIDGE: No way. JAKE: Come on.\\
406 - My grandma has real teeth. You happy?\\
407 - ELDRIDGE: How do you know?\\
408 - JAKE: She bit me once.\\
409 - Well, that was great.\\
410 - I'm really glad we got to spend some time together.\\
411 - Yeah, it was lovely.\\
412 - Yeah. Oh, don't forget\\
413 - we have that meeting with the venture fund tomorrow.\\
414 - Oh, yeah, right.\\
415 - Bye. Oh, bye.\\
416 - Oh, do me a favor, Zoey.\\
417 - Don't let him wear sandals to the meeting.\\
418 - I really don't tell him what to wear.\\
419 - That's okay. You'll learn.\\
420 - Don't wear sandals to the meeting.\\
421 - Good night. Good night.\\
422 - Night-night. Bye. Drive safe.\\
423 - Mm.\\
424 - (sighs) I think that went great.\\
425 - Do you?\\
426 - You don't?\\
427 - I don't.\\
428 - I don't, either.\\
429 - Did... Um, did I miss something?\\
430 - Obviously, you missed everything.\\
431 - That horrible woman won't be happy\\
432 - till she's destroyed our relationship,\\
433 - and she has you back.\\
434 - What? No!\\
435 - She has a boyfriend. She's happy.\\
436 - Oh, how can you be so smart about some things\\
437 - and so stupid about others?\\
438 - Okay, wait, just to be clear,\\
439 - what am I smart about and what am I stupid about?!\\
440 - Oh, what? Now you can't hear me!\\
441 -     Men.    \\
442 - Anybody want more mashed potatoes?\\
443 - Oh, gosh, I'm full, Jean,\\
444 - but everything's so delicious.\\
445 - Thank you.\\
446 - And how lucky were you to grow up with Mom's home cooking?\\
447 - Excuse me. You grew up with home cooking, too.\\
448 - Yes, but the maid did the cooking.\\
449 - It was still at home.\\
450 - Make sure you leave room for dessert.\\
451 - I made pie.\\
452 - Oh, I love Grandma's pie.\\
453 - Yeah, yeah, I heard it, too.\\
454 - (clinking spoon on glass)\\
455 - There's something I'd like to say.\\
456 - Oh, dear God, here it comes.\\
457 - It gives me such pleasure to welcome Jean into my home\\
458 - and to share our new friendship with our two families.\\
459 - Hear, hear. Hear, hear.\\
460 - Hear, hear.\\
461 - And I'd just like to thank Evy for showing me\\
462 - that it's never too late to teach an old dog new tricks.\\
463 - Certainly didn't teach her to fetch a bone.\\
464 - Shh.\\
465 - I have a question.\\
466 - Oh, God, here it comes.\\
467 - If you and her were cannibals,\\
468 - which do you think would eat the other?\\
469 - There you have it: the upside of stupid.\\
470 - ZOEY: I'm sorry, Walden, but Bridget's right.\\
471 - You have history with her; you have none with me.\\
472 - You can't even be sure I love you for yourself\\
473 - and not your money.\\
474 - What are you saying?\\
475 - I'm saying, I think it might be better\\
476 - for both of us if we went our separate ways.\\
477 - Okay, that's one approach...\\
478 - which stinks.\\
479 - So, let me make a counterproposal.\\
480 - Why don't you move in with me?\\
481 - What?\\
482 - Yeah, you and Ava move in with me.\\
483 - I love you, and I want you in my life,\\
484 - I want... I want to have a future with you.\\
485 - Really?\\
486 - Really.\\
487 - AVA: Mummy, Mummy, please say yes!\\
488 - What are you doing out of bed?!\\
489 - I love you, Walden!\\
490 - I love you, Ava.\\
491 - Get back into bed!\\
492 - Hmm. Let's see.\\
493 - So, that's one vote for yes, and I vote yes,\\
494 - so, the motion is passed.\\
495 - There is one tiny little problem.\\
496 - What's that?\\
497 - If Ava and I move in,\\
498 - isn't somebody going to have to move out?\\
499 - Hmm.\\
500 - (groans)\\
501 - What's the matter? I don't know.\\
502 - Just felt a little shiver go down my spine.\\
503 - (groans)\\
504 -     Men.    \\
505 - Here you go.\\
506 - I got to ask.\\
507 - What's with the tea?\\
508 - You make it for me. You make it for Lyndsey.\\
509 - Well, I've got a little philosophy.\\
510 - When someone's nice enough\\
511 - to let me into their home or their pants,\\
512 - I like to show my appreciation.\\
513 - Without spending any money.\\
514 - You know me so well.\\
515 - So, recap.\\
516 - How'd your dinner go?\\
517 - Oh, pretty well, actually.\\
518 - The grandmas were on their best behavior,\\
519 - and the two boys-- well, let's just say,\\
520 - they're gonna be living with us for a long, long time. And you?\\
521 - Oh, good, good. It went really good.\\
522 - So, everything's okay with Zoey? Yeah, it's fantastic.\\
523 - Sounds like everything's great with you and Lyndsey, huh?\\
524 - Oh, yeah, more than good.\\
525 - Oh, forgot the honey.\\
526 - She owns her own home, right?\\
527 - Yeah.\\
528 - (groans)\\
529 - Hmm. Think I may be coming down with something.\\

6 - I want... I want to have a future with you.\\
7 - If Ava and I move in,\\
8 - isn't somebody going to have to move out?\\
9 - Hmm.\\
10 - Oh, yeah, yeah. That's the ticket.\\
11 - Yes. Out with the bad.\\
12 - Morning.\\
13 - Morning.\\
14 - Hey, I'm glad you're up.\\
15 - I wanted...\\
16 - Oh, whoa.\\
17 - Sorry.\\
18 - Is that really a good workout?\\
19 - Oh, yeah, yeah. It's great for the circulation,\\
20 - stretches the spine.\\
21 - Your ball is hanging out.\\
22 - Oopsie-daisy.\\
23 - Back in the barn.\\
24 - Wha... All right, listen, uh,\\
25 - it's spring break this week, so Zoey and her daughter\\
26 - are going to stay here. Oh, that's nice.\\
27 - Yeah, it's kind of like a... trial run.\\
28 - You know, see what it's like to live together\\
29 - before we decide to do anything permanent.\\
30 - Oh, that's a good idea.\\
31 - Living together is tricky.\\
32 - Ball.\\
33 - Sorry.\\
34 - Of course it's going to be a little tight\\
35 - with all of us living here.\\
36 - Yeah.\\
37 - That's what I wanted to talk to you about.\\
38 - Oh, don't worry. I'll tell Jake to go to his mom's.\\
39 - Good, good.\\
40 - And I'll make myself scarce. You won't even know I'm here.\\
41 - Oop. Stepped on a duck.\\
42 - All right, actually, I'm going to need you to, uh,\\
43 - move out for the week.\\
44 - What, wait, the whole week?\\
45 - Yeah, you and Zoey don't really gel,\\
46 - so, I just thought it'd be for the best.\\
47 - Oh, oh, that's fine. Uh, but, uh, you know,\\
48 - just for the record, I gel with pretty much everybody.\\
49 - I mean, ask around, I'm positively gelatinous.\\
50 - I know, it's her.\\
51 - So, the plan is, I come back after a week?\\
52 - Uh, you might want to think of this as a trial run of your own.\\
53 - I mean, in case Zoey and I do decide to\\
54 - live together permanently.\\
55 - Sure, sure, I get it.\\
56 - Uh, and, uh, let me just add that\\
57 - no one is rooting for your personal happiness\\
58 - more than I am.\\
59 - That's good to hear.\\
60 - Thanks, man. Oh, no, no, no.\\

82 - All right, look, it's not going to be any extra work for you.\\

109 - in a Malibu beach house.\\
110 - You're cute, but you got a mean streak.\\
111 - All right, here we are.\\
112 - What do you think?\\

220 - Can you fix it?\\
221 - I don't see any spare fuses but, uh,\\
222 - I do know a little trick. What's that?\\
223 - Well, most people don't know this,\\
224 - but you can use an ordinary copper penny\\
225 - to replace a fuse. No kidding?\\
226 - Yeah, electricians won't tell you\\
227 - 'cause they want to charge you...\\
228 - It worked! The TV's back on!\\

253 - I don't want to have nightmares.\\
254 - Right.\\
255 - It's all clear.\\
256 - Aah... great.\\
257 - Now I'm gonna have nightmares.\\
258 - Okay, okay, good night.\\
259 - I'm thirsty.\\
260 - You're joking.\\
261 - Why would I joke about thirsty?\\
262 - Thirsty's not funny.\\
263 - I'll get you a glass of water.\\
264 - No, I want fizzy water.\\
265 - You want Perrier?\\
266 - Pellegrino would be fine.\\
267 - Okay.\\
268 - I'll go see what we have.\\
269 - How did the story end?\\
270 - Uh... they got married,\\
271 - and they lived happily together for many, many years.\\
272 - Till they had kids.\\
273 -     Men.    \\
274 - How are you feeling?\\
275 - All right.\\
276 - My hand's still a little numb.\\
277 - Well, let's see if I can make it all better.\\
278 - Mmm... Ooh! Ooh!\\
279 - Make it all better.\\
280 - Daddy like. Mmm...\\
281 - Did you hear something?\\
282 - Mm, nothing but the rustling in my jammies.\\
283 - No!\\
284 - There's someone downstairs.\\
285 - No, there isn't. Come on, make it all better.\\
286 - Alan!\\
287 - There's someone in the house. Go look.\\
288 - Really? With a dead hand and the beginnings of an erection?\\
289 - Go.\\
290 - And thus ends the erection.\\
291 - Who keeps their weed in the crisper?\\
292 - What, you want to get crispy, don't you?\\
293 - Ow!\\
294 - Good morning.\\
295 - It's still dark out.\\
296 - It's breakfast time.\\
297 - Maybe in London.\\
298 - What's going on?\\
299 - She wants breakfast.\\
300 - Okay.\\
301 - Just give me a minute.\\
302 - No, you sleep; I'll get it.\\
303 - Thanks.\\
304 - That's it? No argument?\\
305 - Shh...\\
306 - All right.\\
307 - What do you want?\\
308 - Corn Flakes or Cheerios or...\\
309 - Eggs Benedict.\\
310 - Of course.\\
311 -     Men.    \\
312 - Watch your step.\\
313 - Yeah, wouldn't want to get hurt.\\
314 - Those pain pills starting to kick in yet?\\
315 - Oh, yeah.\\
316 - You could spread me on a toast.\\
317 - Okay.\\
318 - Let's get you into bed.\\
319 - No, no.\\
320 - Let's get you into bed.\\
321 - Seriously?\\
322 - You want to fool around?\\
323 - Parts of me do.\\
324 - - Mr. Nose says, "No," but Mr. - "Yes""\\
325 - Tell you what,\\
326 - why don't you just lie down and let me take care of you.\\
327 - Really?\\
328 - You took care of me when I thought there was someone in the house.\\
329 - Oh, right, right, I did.\\
330 - I was brave.\\
331 - Let's just get this belt and zipper undone.\\
332 - Good thing you could breathe through your nose.\\
333 - - Ow! - What?! Ball snag!\\
334 - Oh, sorry! No, no, don't touch it!\\
335 - Don't...! Oh!\\
336 - I think I broke Mr. Hose.\\
337 - Hey!\\
338 - What?\\
339 - What in the hell happened here?\\
340 - I tried to make breakfast for the kid.\\
341 - "Tried"?\\
342 - Yeah. The eggs were too runny,\\
343 - so I made oatmeal that was too dry,\\
344 - so I made waffles that were-- and I quote--\\
345 - "Bloody dreadful."\\
346 - Where is she now?\\
347 - I don't know; I don't care.\\
348 - I can't do this, Berta.\\
349 - It's just... it's too much.\\
350 - She just never stops.\\
351 - Yeah, I raised four daughters.\\
352 - The only thing that slows them down is jail and johnsons.\\
353 - I told Zoey we were gonna be a family.\\
354 - What am I gonna do?\\
355 - The kid's seven?\\
356 - Yeah.\\
357 - Wait nine years.\\
358 - What happens in nine years?\\
359 - If you're lucky, she runs away with a coke-addled bass player.\\
360 - And if I'm not lucky?\\
361 - A drummer.\\
362 -     Men.    \\
363 - Hey.\\
364 - Oh, you're up.\\
365 - How are you feeling?\\
366 - A little better.\\
367 - I'm glad.\\
368 - Not looking forward to ripping the Band-Aid\\
369 - off my scrotum, but...\\
370 - we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.\\
371 - I'm so, so sorry.\\
372 - Yeah, just...\\
373 - FYI, if you'd like to try again, I'm wearing sweatpants.\\
374 - No zipper.\\
375 - I cannot believe you're still horny.\\
376 - Me neither, but there it is.\\
377 - Well, I do owe you one.\\
378 - Oh, boy.\\
379 - Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.\\
380 - Do you smell that?\\
381 - Oh, don't worry.\\
382 - That's just the Neosporin.\\
383 - No.\\
384 - It-it smells like something dead.\\
385 - It's not Mr. Hose.\\
386 - He's very much alive.\\
387 - Go ahead. Check.\\
388 - I think it's coming from under the house.\\
389 - I'm sorry, I-I really can't smell anything\\
390 - 'cause of my broken nose...\\
391 - 'cause of what you owe me.\\
392 - It-it's probably just a raccoon or a possum.\\
393 - Hang on one sec.\\
394 - Let me call the exterminator.\\
395 - Oh, no, no, no, that's going to take too long.\\
396 - I'll ju... I'll just get a shovel and a garbage bag\\
397 - and deal with it.\\
398 - You're that horny?\\
399 - I know, it's starting to worry me, too.\\
400 - You okay down there?\\
401 - Yeah. Yeah, I think I see it.\\
402 - Looks like a-a dead possum.\\
403 - Be careful.\\
404 - Oh, don't worry about it.\\
405 - I-I'm just going to shovel him into my...\\
406 - Not dead! Not dead!\\
407 - Ow! Ow!\\
408 - Yah! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!\\
409 - I didn't mean... Ow! No! Ow!\\
410 - Come on!\\
411 - Oh, that's going to get infected.\\
412 - Ah! Ahh!\\
413 -     Men.    \\
414 - Thank you.\\
415 - Hey.\\
416 - Oh, hey. Thanks for meeting me, man.\\
417 - Whoa!\\
418 - What happened to you?\\
419 - Well, let's see, uh...\\
420 - Electrocuted, got my nose bashed in,\\
421 - and possibly rabies.\\
422 - How are you?\\
423 - I am really tired.\\
424 - My heart bleeds for you.\\
425 - Also my left ball sack.\\
426 - What's that smell?\\
427 - Oh, Neosporin, which just a hint of possum.\\
428 - So, uh, how are things going living with Zoey and her daughter?\\
429 - It's good, it's good.\\
430 - Oh.\\
431 - How's living with Lyndsey?\\

53 - Have you ever considered Switzerland?\\
54 - You're kidding, right?\\
55 - I'm ki.. of course!\\

102 - I want him to have the best possible care.\\
103 - So, whatever it takes, I'll pay for it.\\
104 - You're going to have to.\\
105 - The man's got the worst insurance policy I've ever seen.\\
106 - What do you mean? He's got a $500,000 deductible.\\
107 - A $500,000 deductible?\\
108 - Even at our prices, he ain't gonna\\
109 - hit that with one heart attack.\\
110 - All right, well, I'll just... I'll take care of it.\\
111 - Just check the box "Domestic Partner."\\
112 - Oh, no, we're just buddies.\\
113 - We got no buddy forms.\\

133 - It was the form. It was just easier.\\
134 - Um, did he actually have a heart attack?\\
135 - It was a mild one, but yes. Told you.\\

138 - For how long?\\
139 - I don't know, at least a month or two.\\
140 - Great...\\

161 - Oh, that's... that's so good to hear.\\
162 - Thataboy.\\
163 - I just... I just want you to not worry about anything.\\
164 - I won't.\\
165 - Okay.\\
166 - You just relax and feel better, okay?\\
167 - Okeydokey.\\
168 - Hey, Walden. Guess what?\\
169 - What?\\
170 - I'm peeing right now.\\
171 - No kidding.\\
172 - But it's okay.\\
173 - There's a tube attached to my wiener.\\
174 - I don't think there is.\\
175 - Oh...\\
176 - Men...\\
177 - - My God. He's going to be okay? - Yeah.\\
178 - He just needs to take it easy.\\
179 - I don't know what I would do\\
180 - if anything happened to him.\\
181 - I've already lost my good son!\\
182 - Do you happen to know if they validate parking?\\
183 - So, are those tubes putting stuff in\\
184 - or taking stuff out?\\
185 - I think a little bit of both.\\
186 - Oh, I get it.\\
187 - It's like eating on the toilet.\\
188 - So, what did the doctor say?\\
189 - Uh, he just said he needs to take it easy.\\
190 - You know, no stress.\\
191 - Then I guess we shouldn't tell him\\
192 - about what happened at school.\\
193 - No, we definitely should not.\\
194 - Honest to God, someone put that pot in my locker.\\
195 - Why would they do that?\\
196 - That, my friend, is the million-dollar question.\\
197 - Look, Lyndsey,\\
198 - I know you're his girlfriend,\\
199 - and I know you'd like to take care of him, but...\\
200 - I kind of feel responsible for this.\\
201 - And I'd like him to stay with me until he recovers.\\
202 - Fine. Let's go get some coffee.\\
203 - Men...\\
204 - Wake up, Alan.\\
205 - Is it spongebath time again?\\
206 - You wish.\\
207 - What's going on?\\
208 - Who are you?\\
209 - Ah, Alan, that hurts.\\
210 - Don't you recognize your own brother?\\
211 - Men...\\
212 - What is this, some kind of sick joke?\\
213 - Charlie's dead.\\
214 - You're dubious. Understandable.\\
215 - When you were 14 years old,\\
216 - you went to your first boy/girl party,\\
217 - and you were really nervous\\
218 - because they were going to play spin the bottle.\\
219 - Yeah?\\
220 - So, before you left the house,\\
221 - I convinced you that the grownup way to French-kiss\\
222 - was to spit in the other person's mouth.\\
223 - You hocked a big loogie down Marcy Bilson's throat\\
224 - and she'd kicked you in the nuts.\\
225 - Ah, come on, everybody in high school knew that story.\\
226 - Answer me this:\\
227 - What are your five favorite words to hear from a woman?\\
228 - "I can't spend the night."\\
229 - Charlie...\\
230 - At your service.\\
231 - I don't... I don't understand.\\
232 - Are you reincarnated or something?\\
233 - Nah, I'm in hell.\\
234 - Walking around in this old broad's body\\
235 - is supposed to be some kind of eternal damnation.\\
236 - You know what?\\
237 - The joke's on them.\\
238 - Boobs are still boobs.\\
239 - So, why are you here?\\
240 - I thought you could use a little help.\\
241 - I have been through a rough patch.\\
242 - You look like you've been through a propeller.\\
243 - I came here to tell you it's not too late\\
244 - to turn your life around.\\
245 - How?\\
246 - Stop being a parasite.\\
247 - Step up. Be a man. Grow a pair.\\
248 - Uh, parenthetically, this body actually has a pair.\\
249 - They dangle right under my hooha.\\
250 - Did not need to know that.\\
251 - Point being, you lived on me for eight years\\
252 - and now you're living off this new guy.\\
253 - Now, now, hang on. W-Walden's my friend.\\
254 - He invited me to stay with him.\\
255 - Oh, kiss my surprisingly tight ass.\\
256 - You're nobody's friend.\\
257 - You're a useless appendage, like tonsils,\\
258 - or the nutsack under my hooha.\\
259 - I see hell hasn't mellowed you out any.\\
260 - Listen to me, you got to get out\\
261 - of that guy's house and make a life for yourself.\\
262 - I suppose I could go live with Lyndsey.\\
263 - You're missing my point.\\
264 - I'm not suggesting that the tapeworm\\
265 - find a new colon to crawl into.\\
266 - Hold out your hand.\\
267 - Thank you.\\
268 - This is your last chance, Alan.\\
269 - Move out of that house. Get your own place.\\
270 - Start pulling your own weight in the world.\\
271 - Okay. I will.\\
272 - You'll see. I can change.\\
273 - Good.\\
274 - Then my work here is done.\\
275 - Well, thanks, Charlie.\\
276 - You got it.\\
277 - Oh, uh,\\
278 - Before I go...\\
279 - ...you gotta check this out.\\
280 - Oh!\\
281 - Oh!\\
282 - Was I lying?\\
283 - Tell me that's not disturbing.\\
284 - Men...\\
285 - What do you want me to do, Zoey?\\
286 - The last time I asked him to leave, he almost died.\\
287 - Well, what does that mean?\\
288 - He lives with you until he actually does die?\\
289 - No, just until he gets back on his feet.\\
290 - The man has no feet.\\
291 - He is a footless man.\\
292 - Okay, come on.\\
293 - What about his mother? Why doesn't he live with her?\\
294 - They don't really get along.\\
295 - What about his girlfriend?\\
296 - They don't really get along.\\
297 - Oh, God.\\
298 - So we're stuck with him forever.\\
299 - The man is the herpes of houseguests.\\
300 - Come on. That is not fair.\\
301 - You're right.\\
302 - Herpes sometimes disappears for a while.\\
303 - Surprise!\\
304 - Alan.\\
305 - Herpes.\\
306 - What? They let you out?\\
307 - Oh, no, no. I checked myself out.\\
308 - I didn't want you to have to pay one more penny for me.\\
309 - Oh, come on.\\
310 - The money is not important.\\
311 - What's important is your health.\\
312 - No, what's important is that I stop being a parasite\\
313 - and stand on my own two feet.\\
314 - You have no feet.\\
315 - What was that?\\
316 - It's Zoey.\\
317 - I'll be right there, honey.\\
318 - I'm just going to grab my stuff, and I'll get out of your hair.\\
319 - Are you sure?\\
320 - I am positive, Walden. I-I have had an epiphany.\\
321 - I need to make a big change in my life.\\
322 - Wow.\\
323 - Where will you go?\\
324 - Oh, I found a cute little place online.\\
325 - Uh, you know, it's not much,\\
326 - but, uh, at least I'll have my pride.\\
327 - I don't know, Alan.\\
328 - Let the man have his pride!\\
329 - Uh, here's my address for mailing stuff.\\
330 - If this is what you want...\\
331 - It's what I want.\\
332 - It's what everybody wants!\\
333 - Don't listen to her.\\
334 - Oh, no, no. She's right.\\
335 - She's an angry, cold-hearted tea bag!\\
336 - But she's right.\\
337 - What did he say?\\
338 - He said that you were right.\\
339 - Men...\\
340 - No, Jake.\\
341 - If I'm not living at the beach house,\\
342 - you're not living at the beach house.\\
343 - Yeah, well, sometimes life just isn't fair.\\
344 - Well, sure you can visit me where I'm living now.\\
345 - But, uh, you're not going to have your own room\\
346 - or your own bed or your own bathroom\\
347 - and... you might need to have a tetanus shot.\\
348 - But I'd love to have you.\\
349 - Okay, you let me know.\\
350 - Okay, good night.\\
351 - All right.\\
352 - It's not much, but...\\
353 - it's mine.\\
354 - I am self-sufficient.\\
355 - And beholden to no one.\\
356 - Oh, that's not a good sign.\\
357 - Men...\\
358 - It's odd...\\
359 - But now that Alan's finally gone,\\
360 - I actually kind of miss him.\\
361 - Yeah, me too.\\
362 - Walden, I'm kidding.\\
363 - Oh, yeah, me too.\\
364 - So...\\
365 - Now that we have the house to ourselves,\\
366 - what would you like to do?\\
367 - What I would like to do\\
368 - is you.\\
369 - And where I would like to do it,\\
370 - is on every flat surface\\
371 - in every room of this house.\\
372 - Mm. Mm.\\
373 - Woo. Hey.\\
374 - Oh. Jake.\\
375 - This is my friend, Gabby.\\
376 - Hi!\\
377 - We're going to go hang out in my room.\\
378 - Uh, Jake, uh,\\
379 - hold on.\\
380 - Have you spoken to your father lately?\\
381 - No, I don't believe I have.\\
382 - Look at the bright side.\\
383 - What bright side?\\
384 - He might share some of his pot with us.\\
385 - Men...\\
386 - Wake up, buttercup.\\
387 - Oh. Hey, Charlie.\\
388 - So, what do you think?\\
389 - I finally got my own place.\\
390 - Fantastic.\\
391 - You're not sponging off that rat, are you?\\
392 - There's a rat?\\
393 - Nah, I'm just kiddin'.\\
394 - He's dead.\\
395 - But aren't you proud of me? I mean, I did what you said.\\
396 - I'm standing on my own two feet.\\
397 - Yeah.\\
398 - Sucker.\\
399 - What?\\
400 - I had to come back from hell to do it,\\
401 - but I finally gotcha out of my freakin' house!\\
402 - But I-I-I thought you wanted me to be a better person.\\
403 - Nope.\\
404 - What? So you were just screwing with me?\\
405 - Yep.\\
406 - Why?\\
407 - I'm in hell, Alan. That's kind of what we do.\\
408 - Whoa!\\
409 - What a horrible dream.\\
410 - What's so horrible about it?\\
411 - Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo.\\
412 - Still here.\\
413 - I can do this aaalll night.\\
414 - Men...\\
415 - Okay.\\
416 - How do we sell this? Uh...\\
417 - 911...\\
418 - 911!\\
419 - Come on. You can do better than that. Uh...\\
420 - Ah...\\
421 - Help me.\\
422 - Call 911.\\
423 - Am I dying or taking a dump?\\
424 - Ah.\\
425 - Call 911... Call 911...\\
426 - Yeah, that's it. Okay.\\
427 - Showtime.\\
428 - Alan...\\
429 - Don't, don't worry. I'm not moving back in.\\
430 - I just forgot a few things.\\
431 - Yeah, like your son?\\
432 - Wait. Jake's here?\\
433 - Yeah, and his girlfriend.\\
434 - Ah,  you know, damn that kid.\\
435 - I told him I was moving out and he was not to come back here.\\
436 - But does he listen to me? No.\\
437 - You know, no one ever listens to me and I...\\
438 - Call 911.\\
439 - Call 911. Oh, no, not again.\\
440 - Hold on. I'll get help.\\
441 - Son of a bitch.\\
442 - What's the matter? Couldn't find a shark?\\
443 - Men...\\
444 - So, what do you think, Doc?\\
445 - We won't know until we get all the tests back,\\
446 - but right now, his heart appears to be perfectly fine.\\
447 - Thank God.\\
448 - So how long before I can take him home?\\
449 - Walden?\\
450 - I am sorry, Zoey, but I am not going to have\\
451 - this man's death on my conscience.\\
452 - I'd like to thank the Academy.\\
453 - There are no small parts...\\
454 - only small apartments.\\
455 - I don't think you're allowed to smoke in here.\\
456 - Does that include the joint you just blew in the bathroom?\\
457 - How'd you know about that?\\
458 - Call it women's intuition, taterhead.\\
459 - Whoa, the only person that ever called me "taterhead"\\
460 - was my uncle Charlie.\\
461 - So, what does that tell ya?\\
462 - I have no idea.\\
463 - Screw it. I'm going back to hell.\\
464 - Ready, ladies?\\
465 - You bet. We are.\\
466 - Then let's go.\\
467 - And me with with just a nutsack.\\

1 - Previously on:\\
2 - I know that I said that I wanted to get rid of her\\
3 - and have you come back... Oh, no!\\
4 - I'm just going to have to make it work.\\
5 - No, no, no, no, no!\\
6 - I'm sorry!\\
7 - Okay, I'll figure something out.\\
8 - If nothing else, I am a survivor.\\
9 - Doctor said you had a little heart attack.\\
10 - Yeah, I remember now.\\
11 - Zoey's moving in...\\
12 - and I'm moving out...\\
13 - No...\\
14 - No... you're not moving out.\\
15 - I'm not?\\
16 - No, you can stay as long as you want,\\
17 - as long as you need.\\
18 - Oh, that's... that's so good to hear.\\
19 - Really, you don't have to carry my bags.\\
20 - Alan, you had a heart attack, okay?\\
21 - You need to take it easy.\\
22 - Well, I appreciate it, but I'm fine.\\
23 - Whoa, do not say that.\\
24 - Why not?\\
25 - Let me tell you about my Grandma Abigail.\\
26 - When I was a kid, she came to move in with us.\\
27 - And one day I said, "How ya doing, Grandma""\\
28 - And she said, "Fine." And then she dropped dead.\\
29 - You're kidding.\\
30 - No, face down in my Legos.\\
31 - Well, that's terrible.\\
32 - But I'm fine. Do not say that!\\
33 - My Uncle Hal?\\
34 - When I was a kid, he used to spend Thanksgivings us,\\
35 - and one year, we're at dinner and...\\
36 - you know, like football and turkey and the whole bit,\\
37 - and I said, "How ya doing, Uncle Hal""\\
38 - And he said, "Fine""\\
39 - And then he went to the bathroom,\\
40 - and he crapped out his small intestines.\\
41 - Oh, oh... okay, t-that's horrible,\\
42 - but I promise you, I am fine.\\
43 - Surprise!\\
44 - I told you not to say it!\\
45 -     Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men    \\
46 -     Ah.         Men.    \\

49 - Oh, my God, somebody call 911.\\
50 - Gotcha.\\
51 - Oh...\\
52 - Alan, don't you ever do that to me again.\\
53 - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\\
54 - So all you guys came just to welcome me back?\\
55 - Of course we did, darling. We were worried about you.\\
56 - Yeah, I've been beside myself with concern.\\
57 - I don't know what to say. I'm really touched.\\
58 - Come here, Alan.\\
59 - Sit down. I made you some tea.\\
60 - Wait, did you just call me Alan?\\
61 - Well, that's your name, isn't it?\\
62 - Yeah, but you always call me Zippy.\\
63 - I know, but I've got a little rule.\\
64 - I never make fun of someone who could come back and haunt me.\\
65 - Sugar or honey?\\
66 - I thought we decided on Alan?\\
67 - Uh, honey, please.\\
68 - Hey, are you warm enough?\\
69 - Do you want me to turn up the heat?\\
70 - I'm fine. Don't say that...\\
71 - Okay, turn up the heat.\\
72 - Why don't you just lay down.\\
73 - Uh, no, really, I'm good. I've been in bed for a week.\\
74 - Do it for me.\\
75 - Uh, okay, but let me just point out\\
76 - that that never works when I say that to you.\\
77 - Guess what. While you were in the hospital,\\
78 - I aced all my final exams.\\
79 - Really?! I don't believe it!\\
80 - I told you he wouldn't buy it.\\
81 - Wait, wait, wait. You lied to me?\\
82 - Uh, I told him to. I thought the truth might kill you.\\
83 - But there is some real good news. What's that?\\
84 - I found out for sure I'm not gay.\\
85 - But why's that good news?\\
86 - It's mostly good news for gay people.\\
87 - A-A-All right, look, I appreciate\\
88 - all the trouble you're taking to welcome me home,\\
89 - but if you don't mind, I'd just like to go back to my room.\\
90 - Oh, you heard him.\\
91 - He wants to go to his room. Here, Zoey.\\
92 - Take the tea.\\
93 - Walden, I can walk on my own.\\
94 - That's what my blind Aunt Shirley said.\\
95 - And then we went to Miami\\
96 - on Christmas vacation,\\
97 - and then "blam""\\
98 - Greyhound came out of nowhere and flattened her.\\
99 - She got hit by a bus?\\
100 - No, she wandered onto the dog track\\
101 - in the middle of the ninth race.\\
102 - Technically, she came in third.\\
103 - Anyway, I got a little     surprise for you.    \\
104 - Oh, Walden, you've already done so much.\\
105 - I don't know what else you could possibly...\\
106 - A real bed! Yeah.\\
107 - It's not just a bed. Get on it. Check it out.\\
108 - Oh, my golly.\\
109 - Ah... Oo-ho-ho-ho!\\
110 - The bed is becoming tumescent.\\
111 - Yeah...!\\
112 - Pretty cool, uh?\\
113 - See, so you don't have to exert yourself\\
114 - when you're getting in and out.\\
115 - Ah! Oh,\\
116 - and what pray tell is that?\\
117 - That is a 46" high-definition plasma screen TV,\\
118 - complete with a deluxe sports satellite package\\
119 - Nice! No movies?\\
120 - No, we could switch it to a movie package.\\
121 - Or you could add it.\\
122 - Oh, okay, we'll add it.\\
123 - And don't forget the adult channels.\\
124 - No problem.\\
125 - You have to ask for them specifically.\\
126 - Otherwise they block them.\\
127 - Right.\\
128 - Hey, why don't you take a nap until dinner?\\
129 - I'm not tired.\\
130 - That's what my cousin Earl said\\
131 - right before he fell asleep with a cigarette in his hand.\\
132 - Set his bed on fire?\\
133 - No, his fireworks stand.\\
134 - I was standing across the street yelling at him to wake up\\
135 - when the first rocket went off, followed by 800 Roman candles.\\
136 - It was horrifying and really cool at the same time.\\
137 - Okay, I'll take a nap.\\
138 - Good, good, good, you just...\\
139 - I don't want you to do anything.\\
140 - Just relax and get better.\\
141 - That's a nice thought, Walden,\\
142 - but I got a lot of work to do.\\
143 - I got bills to pay.\\
144 - No, don't worry about the bills.\\
145 - I'll take care of everything.\\
146 - Walden, I can't let you just take care of everything.\\
147 - Listen, I made a promise to myself when I was 11 years old\\
148 - and salmonella decimated my father's entire side\\
149 - of the family at the annual Easter egg hunt.\\
150 - Nobody else dies on my watch.\\
151 - Poor guy, living with all that guilt.\\
152 - I can exploit that.\\
153 - How come you're not coming over?\\
154 - I can't. I have Ava.\\
155 - Why don't you come over here?\\
156 - I can't. I have Alan.\\
157 - Oh, for God's sake.\\
158 - Well, he had a heart attack, Zoey.\\
159 - Oh, bollocks.\\
160 - He's going to outlive us all.\\
161 - A week after nuclear Armageddon, the world will be populated\\
162 - by nothing but cockroaches and Alan Harper.\\
163 - Wow, that is a side of you that is not attractive.\\
164 - It's the lawyer side of me.\\
165 - Yeah, yuck.\\
166 - Look, I see these kind of scam artists all the time\\
167 - and I don't want you being taken advantage of.\\
168 - I am just taking care of my friend.\\
169 - No, you are providing food, shelter, and satellite TV\\
170 - to a cockroach.\\
171 - Hello, anybody?\\
172 - Getting kind of hungry in here.\\
173 - Uh, B-Berta, Alan's hungry.\\
174 - Is his dinner ready yet?\\
175 - Coming up.\\
176 - Really?\\
177 - He gets room service?\\
178 - Did I ever tell you about my Aunt Phyllis?\\
179 - When I was a kid she took me on a trip to New York,\\
180 - and we were staying at the Waldorf-Astoria,\\
181 - and she didn't want to wait for room service,\\
182 - so she headed down to the restaurant\\
183 - and she fell 24 stories down an empty elevator shaft.\\
184 - We never got to see Cats.\\
185 - So you're afraid Alan is going to fall into an elevator shaft?\\
186 - Don't poke at it, Zoey. The wound is still fresh.\\
187 - Come in.\\
188 - Did my little buddy save room for dessert?\\
189 - I sure did, Skipper.\\
190 - Good, 'cause I made your favorite.\\
191 - Peach cobbler? Yep.\\
192 - Warm with ice cream?\\
193 - I'll be right back.\\
194 - I'm not going anywhere.\\
195 - Okay, let's see what's on those adult channels.\\
196 - Avatart.\\
197 - Oh, in 3D.\\
198 - Oh, to be continued.\\
199 - Come in.\\
200 - Hey, you.\\
201 - Judith, what a, what a nice surprise.\\
202 - How are you feeling?\\
203 - Not bad, all things considered.\\
204 - Oh, you're so brave.\\
205 - Now, listen, there's something we need to talk about.\\
206 - Look, I know the child support checks are late,\\
207 - but, but please allow me to get back to my job.\\
208 - Er?\\
209 - Forget the child support.\\
210 - Er?\\
211 - You just get better.\\
212 - I can manage fine without your money.\\
213 - All right.\\
214 - I always suspected as much, but thank you.\\
215 - And Herb and I have the condo in Palm Springs,\\
216 - so you're certainly welcome to use it\\
217 - while you're recuperating.\\
218 - How can you afford a condo in Palm Springs?\\
219 - We made a judgment call with Jake's college fund.\\
220 - Anyway, you're welcome to use it.\\
221 - Wow, thank you, th-that's very generous.\\
222 - Well, look, I know we've obviously had our differences.\\
223 - We have.\\
224 - And I haven't always been very nice to you.\\
225 - I just figured you didn't like me.\\
226 - Alan, we were married for 12 years.\\
227 - You're the father of my son.\\
228 - Just because I couldn't stay married to you\\
229 - doesn't mean I stopped loving you.\\
230 - Gee, it sure felt that way.\\
231 - Oh, I'm sorry for that.\\
232 - You just get well, okay?\\
233 - Okay.\\
234 - A house in Malibu, no child support,\\
235 - free condo in Palm Springs.\\
236 - Why would anyone want to eliminate heart disease?\\
237 - Don't worry, you lovely blue ladies,\\
238 - as soon as my right hand is free,\\
239 - I'll be giving you my full attention.\\
240 - Rats.\\
241 - Uh...\\
242 - Come in.\\
243 - How's my man?\\
244 - Oh, you know, okay\\
245 - for a guy who recently stared into the jaws of death.\\
246 - That's why I'm here.\\
247 - I want to help with your recovery.\\
248 - Really, what'd you have in mind?\\
249 - I-I'm not supposed to exert myself.\\
250 - Don't worry, you don't have to do a thing.\\
251 - Just lie back and I'll do all the work.\\
252 - Really?\\
253 - Hmm. Okay.\\
254 - Uh, let me put my cobbler down.\\
255 - No, no, no, keep it.\\
256 - You sure?\\
257 - Absolutely.\\
258 - It'd be rude for me to eat alone.\\
259 - All righty then.\\
260 - You got any porn on this thing?\\
261 - Uh, gee, I, I don't know.\\
262 - Why don't you check?\\
263 - Shake things up a bit.\\
264 - Oh, gosh, well, I, yeah,\\
265 - I guess I, I guess I, I-I could do that.\\
266 - Oh, look, there's some now.\\
267 - How fortuitous.\\
268 - Now, just relax and enjoy your cobbler.\\
269 - Right back at you.\\
270 - This is the best day of my entire life.\\
271 -     Men.    \\
272 - All right, Mr. Harper.\\
273 - Well, I've got some good news.\\
274 - Let me have it.\\
275 - I'm banging my receptionist.\\
276 - I'm sorry.\\
277 - I... I never get tired of that one.\\
278 - That-that's funny, but, uh, what about me?\\
279 - No, you don't have a chance with her.\\
280 - She likes rich guys.\\
281 - All right, back to your, uh, heart.\\
282 - It's looking good.\\
283 - Uh, are you sure?\\
284 - Tests show you've had no damage.\\
285 - Your cholesterol looks normal.\\
286 - It's like the heart attack never even happened.\\
287 - Oh.\\
288 - And you're not happy about that?\\
289 - No, I-I am.\\
290 - Um, uh, is this confidential, what we're saying?\\
291 - Think of me as a priest.\\
292 - Except, when I touch your nuts, it's strictly business.\\
293 - Okay, uh... uh, uh, here it is.\\
294 - Um, ever since the heart attack,\\
295 - uh, my life has actually gotten better.\\
296 - Uh, my girlfriend, my ex-wife,\\
297 - even my mother have all been showering me\\
298 - with love and attention.\\
299 - Well, they were afraid they were losing you.\\
300 - Have you ever had oral sex and peach cobbler?\\
301 - At the same time?\\
302 - Can't say that I have.\\
303 - Well, I have.\\
304 - And once my girlfriend finds out that I'm healthy,\\
305 - I'm back to sucking Life Savers and humping my pillow.\\
306 - Well, as your doctor, all I can tell you\\
307 - is you're perfectly healthy.\\
308 - Can I get a second opinion?\\
309 - Yes, you're ugly, too.\\
310 - I joke.\\
311 - Uh, again, as your doctor,\\
312 - I have to tell you you're in great shape.\\
313 - But, uh...\\
314 - as a guy who's banging his receptionist,\\
315 - two pharmaceutical reps\\
316 - and, uh, on occasion, his bloated, rich wife,\\
317 - let me add:\\
318 - Don't be a schmuck.\\
319 - Lie your ass off.\\
320 - Thanks, Doc. That's good advice.\\
321 - Hmm.\\
322 - Jeanine, hi.\\
323 - Uh, listen, could you run down to the deli\\
324 - and pick up a peach cobbler\\
325 - and meet me in exam room 2.\\
326 - How'd it go?\\
327 - Good news?\\
328 - It's bad, Mom.\\
329 - It's real bad. Oh.\\
330 - Darling, I am so sorry.\\
331 - Hey, I know what would cheer you up.\\
332 - So do I.\\
333 - No, I was thinking I could take you shopping.\\
334 - Come on, now.\\
335 - There must be something I can get you\\
336 - that would turn that frown upside down.\\
337 - Well, uh, remember when I was a kid\\
338 - how I always wanted to be a cowboy?\\
339 - I'm not going to buy you a horse, Alan.\\
340 - Of course not.\\
341 - Guess I'll just have to be a cowboy in Heaven.\\
342 - Are your eyes closed?\\
343 - Yep, they're closed.\\
344 - Open.\\
345 - You must be kidding me.\\
346 - It's the safest way for Alan to get up and down the stairs.\\
347 - Why does he have to get up and down the stairs?\\
348 - So he can use my whirlpool tub.\\
349 - Oh, dear Lord.\\
350 - He needs it for his circulation.\\
351 - He said he's starting to get bed sores.\\
352 - Then you tell him to get out of bed.\\
353 - You don't build him his own private escalator.\\
354 - Howdy, pardner.\\
355 - Ma'am.\\
356 - Wow.\\
357 - You look great.\\
358 - Just checking it off my bucket list.\\
359 - What'd the doctor say?\\
360 - It's not good.\\
361 - I might have to have a transplant.\\
362 - I'm sorry.\\
363 - Let's just hope that somewhere\\
364 - there's a baboon with a healthy heart\\
365 - riding a motorcycle without a helmet.\\
366 - For God's sake.\\
367 - Excuse me. I'm going to take a whirlpool\\
368 - until my masseuse gets here.\\
369 - You got him a masseuse?\\
370 - It helps prevent blood clots.\\
371 - Yeah.\\
372 - My Uncle Fred had a blood clot in his leg,\\
373 - and when I was little, he took me\\
374 - to the Santa Monica Pier, and we went on the Tilt-A-Whirl,\\
375 - and the centrifugal force shot the clot into his brain.\\
376 - It was the worst birthday ever.\\
377 - He's seen a lot of tragedy, Zoey.\\
378 - Be nice to him.\\
379 - Mmm.\\
380 - Too hard?\\
381 - Nah, dig in. I like it rough.\\
382 - Brought your banana smoothie.\\
383 - Oh, thank you, Zoey.\\
384 - Um, would you mind\\
385 - sticking the straw in my donut hole?\\
386 - Oh, I would love to.\\
387 - Mmm.\\
388 - Tasty.\\
389 - I want you to listen to me very carefully.\\
390 - You may have everyone else around here fooled,\\
391 - but I know you're full of crap.\\
392 - Beg pardon?\\
393 - What you do with your family\\
394 - and your girlfriend is your business,\\
395 - but I want you to stop taking advantage of Walden.\\
396 - I-I don't know what you're talking about.\\
397 - You know exactly what I'm talking about.\\
398 - I-I'm sorry. I really don't know what you're...\\
399 - You've been warned.\\
400 - Well, thanks for the... the smoothie, Zoey.\\
401 - That bitch has got to go.\\
402 - How about that?\\
403 - Stars really are just like us.\\
404 - Alan. Oh!\\
405 - Oh, my.\\
406 - Careful.\\
407 - You don't want to give me a heart attack.\\
408 - We need to talk to you.\\
409 - Oh, yeah, sure.\\
410 - I'll be right back.\\
411 - Um, think I left the tub running, so...\\
412 - Stop.\\
413 - Now, get out of that chair and get down here.\\
414 - Okay.\\
415 - The queen has spoken.\\
416 - My legs are still a little al dente.\\
417 - So...\\
418 - what up?\\
419 - I'll tell you "what up."\\
420 - I asked one of the private investigators for my law firm\\
421 - to follow you for a few days.\\
422 - Really?\\
423 - Uh, uh, wh-which days in particular?\\
424 - Well,\\
425 - this is from last Monday,\\
426 - when you said you were going\\
427 - for a therapeutic walk on the beach.\\
428 - Okay. Okay.\\
429 - Yeah, yeah, you know...\\
430 - I can see\\
431 - how this looks,\\
432 - um,\\
433 - but, you know, actually,\\
434 - there is a-a-a very...\\
435 - a very simple, uh, uh, explanation.\\
436 - Okay.\\
437 - Well...\\
438 - we got cobbler in the kitchen.\\
439 - 911?\\
440 - Anybody?\\
441 -     Men.    \\
442 - How long do you plan on lying there?\\
443 - Until the shame passes.\\
444 - So a while?\\
445 - Oh, yeah.\\
446 - All right.\\
447 - Well...\\
448 - sleep well.\\
449 - Thanks. You, too.\\
450 -     Memories    \\
451 -     Light the corners of my mind    \\
452 -     Misty watercolored memories of the way we were...    \\

12 - What? Wait! Hey!\\
13 - Morning.\\
14 - It's 2:00 p.m.\\
15 - So?\\
16 - It's Saturday; I slept in.\\
17 - It's Sunday.\\
18 - Really?\\
19 - That's disturbing.\\
20 - So what did you do last night that you had to sleep all day?\\
21 - One thing at a time.\\
22 - I'm still trying to figure out what happened to Saturday.\\
23 - Jake, you're gonna graduate high school in a few days.\\
24 - Don't you think it's time\\
25 - to start getting your life together?\\
26 - I will if you will.\\
27 - What?\\
28 - I will certainly consider that, Father.\\
29 - This is serious.\\
30 - You will never amount to anything if you sleep all day.\\
31 - Morning.\\

39 - Man, I did not think Jeremy was ever gonna stop talking.\\
40 - Yeah.\\
41 - That guy really puts the "dict" in "valedictorian."\\
42 - Thinks he's so great just 'cause he's going to Harvard.\\
43 - Where is Harvard anyway?\\
44 - Dude, didn't you learn anything in high school?\\
45 - It's the capital of Connecticut.\\
46 - Are you sure?\\
47 - Yeah.\\
48 - Harvard, Connecticut.\\
49 - What'd you think was the capital of Connecticut?\\
50 - "C."\\
51 - You're an idiot.\\
52 - I don't know why I hang out with you.\\
53 - 'Cause you're gay.\\
54 - Well, what does that make you?\\
55 - Attractive.\\
56 - So are your parents giving you a hard time about your "future"?\\
57 - Oh, yeah.\\
58 - Both my mom and my dad.\\
59 - I'm sick of hearing it.\\
60 - Yeah. "If you're not going to college, you need to get a job""\\
61 - Where do they get this stuff?\\
62 - Beats me.\\
63 - So what are we gonna do?\\
64 - About what?\\
65 - Our future.\\
66 - Oh.\\
67 - I could go for some frozen yogurt.\\
68 - Good idea, man.\\
69 - Let's go.\\
70 - Should we take our robes off?\\
71 - No, no, leave them on.\\
72 - They'll attract smart chicks.\\
73 - Come on, Judith. He's your son too.\\
74 - I have videotape of him shooting out of your body.\\
75 - Yes, I've talked to him\\
76 - about his lack of plans, but it's like talking to a wall.\\
77 - A very good-natured, but dense wall.\\
78 - Of course I'm concerned, but what do you want me to do?\\
79 - No, I'm not gonna ask Walden to give him a job.\\
80 - Because it would be an imposition.\\
81 - Yes, more of an imposition than me living there for free.\\
82 - Okay, okay, if it'll get you to shut up, I'll ask him.\\
83 - She's never gonna shut up.\\
84 - Okay, okay.\\
85 - Good-bye, Judith.\\
86 - I am so thankful I have you in my life.\\
87 - What about my son?\\
88 - What about him?\\
89 - You're gonna ask Walden for a job for Jake, but not Eldridge?\\
90 - Of course not.\\
91 - I was just gonna hold Eldridge back to sweeten the deal.\\
92 - I have a question.\\
93 - What?\\
94 - Why didn't you order adjustable chairs?\\
95 - I did.\\
96 - Mine's adjustable.\\
97 - Well, wait.\\
98 - How'd you do that?\\
99 - This lever right here.\\
100 - I don't have a lever.\\
101 - Hmm?\\
102 - Well, that's too bad, you being so short and all.\\
103 - You did this to get back at me.\\
104 - I don't know what you're talking about.\\
105 - For sleeping with your ex-wife.\\
106 - Do you really think that I am so petty\\
107 - that I would pay a chair manufacturer an extra $480\\
108 - to remove the adjustable height feature?\\
109 - That is crazy talk.\\
110 - How's everything down there at the Lollipop Guild?\\
111 - Hey, guys.\\
112 - Am I interrupting?\\
113 - Hey, Alan.\\
114 - Just thought I'd bring you by\\
115 - a little office-warming dieffenbachia.\\
116 - Ah, thank you.\\
117 - Looks like you got the place up and running.\\
118 - We're getting there.\\
119 - Electric Suitcase, Inc.\\
120 - Very, very impressive.\\
121 - What can I do for you?\\
122 - Oh, nothing. I just came to drop off my gift\\
123 - and wish you well.\\
124 - Okay.\\
125 - Okay, well, I'll get out of your hair.\\
126 - Uh, nice to see you again.\\
127 - Yep. Always thrill.\\
128 - Oh, there is one thing.\\
129 - Here we go. Here we go.\\
130 - Um, you know Jake just graduated high school.\\
131 - Oh, hey, I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the ceremony.\\
132 - Oh, don't be silly. No one expected you to.\\
133 - You know what? Here...\\
134 - why don't you give this to him for me.\\
135 - Ooh, a hundred dollars.\\
136 - I will make sure he gets this.\\
137 - What? I-I don't even know the kid.\\
138 - Oh, of course not.\\
139 - Um, anyway, I was just wondering, um,\\
140 - since you've started this exciting venture\\
141 - and obviously you're hiring,\\
142 - that there might be an opportunity here for Jake.\\
143 - He's not going to college?\\
144 - Not unless he's delivering pizzas.\\
145 - Uh, probably true,\\
146 - but he has a good heart,\\
147 - and I'm afraid if I can't find him a decent job,\\
148 - he might have to sell it.\\
149 - Okay, listen, Alan, I'm sorry.\\
150 - I-I like Jake,\\
151 - but I just don't think we have anything for him here.\\
152 - Oh, oh, okay.\\
153 - I understand. You know, he's just my kid.\\
154 - Our future. But, um,\\
155 - but thanks anyway.\\
156 - Oh, wait, wait. Hold it, hold it.\\
157 - Yeah? Yeah?\\
158 - Does he know anything about computers at all?\\
159 - Not per se, but he is eager to learn.\\
160 - He's like a sponge when it comes to soaking up information.\\
161 - No, he isn't.\\
162 - Will you at least give me the sponge part?\\
163 - Yeah, if you lay him on a wet spot,\\
164 - he might absorb liquid.\\
165 - Why are you being such a jerk, man?\\
166 - Let's give the boy a shot.\\
167 - Billy,\\
168 - I've seen this kid spend an entire afternoon\\
169 - smoking dope and trying to lick his own nipples.\\
170 - Who amongst us hasn't... done...\\
171 - Look, we will... we will take him on, okay?\\
172 - Billy... He'll be my responsibility.\\
173 - Oh, thank you so much. You will not regret it.\\
174 - Yes, you will. I will send him right over.\\
175 - Oh, one more thing,\\
176 - uh, my girlfriend's son needs a job too,\\
177 - but you're gonna love him, he's...\\
178 - blonde. Bye.\\
179 - Okay, I'm telling you right now,\\
180 - this is a bad idea.\\
181 - How did you do that?\\
182 - I don't know what you're talking about.\\
183 - Okay, fellas...\\
184 - this is the heart and soul\\
185 - of The Electric Suitcase.\\
186 - 300 state of the art,\\
187 - high bandwidth servers\\
188 - all working in tandem.\\
189 - Cool. Awesome.\\
190 - Any questions so far?\\
191 - Uh, yeah. Is there a cafeteria\\
192 - or do we order in?\\
193 - There's a cafeteria on the 14th floor.\\
194 - Oh. Cool. I got a question.\\
195 - Yes?\\
196 - Do they have donuts?\\
197 - Was I lying?\\
198 - I don't know if I have donuts.\\
199 - That's okay. It's not a deal-breaker.\\
200 - Glad to hear it.\\
201 - Uh, okay, guys...\\
202 - all you have to do between now\\
203 - and 8:00 tomorrow morning,\\
204 - is watch the lights on these servers, all right?\\
205 - If a green goes to red,\\
206 - it means the drive is about to fail\\
207 - so all you do...\\
208 - you pop it out\\
209 - and you replace it\\
210 - with a fresh one from right here.\\
211 - Got it. No problem. All right.\\
212 - Oh, and there's no smoking dope in this building.\\
213 - No, sir. Absolutely not.\\
214 - Not inside the building.\\
215 - Or outside the building.\\
216 - How about the roof?\\
217 - No.\\
218 - What about before we come to work?\\
219 - No!\\
220 - What about brownies?\\
221 - There's no pot, period!\\
222 - No brownies, no God, no roof, no outside, no inside.\\
223 - No problem. All right.\\
224 - Good.\\
225 - Oh, and we just want to take this opportunity\\
226 - to thank you both for this great opportunity.\\
227 - 'Cause let's face it, it is an opportunity.\\
228 - And it's great. Opportunity.\\
229 - Remember, this is on you.\\
230 - Oh, and on a personal note,\\
231 - thank you for the graduation money.\\
232 - It's my pleasure.\\
233 - A kid my age can always use an extra 50 bucks.\\
234 - You know,\\
235 - I kind of like this whole "working for a living" thing.\\
236 - It feels good, you know?\\
237 - Responsible, grownup.\\
238 - Absolutely.\\
239 - All right, we have successfully downloaded\\
240 - 40,000 hours of porn.\\
241 - That's a lot to watch two minutes at a time.\\
242 - I just hope Billy and Walden don't notice\\
243 - that we're using their hard drives.\\
244 - Don't worry. I've labeled every movie "personal."\\
245 - Oh. Good thinking.\\
246 - Oh, red light. I got it.\\
247 - Nicely done.\\
248 - We got this job nailed, my man. Yeah.\\
249 - And the best part is,\\
250 - we are in on the ground floor of the company.\\
251 - Oh, another one.\\
252 - Allow me.\\
253 - Maybe they'll give us stock options and we'll be rich.\\
254 - What exactly is a stock option?\\
255 - It's a call option on the common stock of a company,\\
256 - issued as a form of cash compensation.\\
257 - If the company stock rises,\\
258 - the holder of the option\\
259 - generally experiences a direct financial benefit.\\
260 - Where'd you learn that?\\
261 - Wikipedia. It's not just for term papers.\\
262 - The point is, we're gonna be rich.\\
263 - Oh, another one.\\
264 - Cool. So we'll have our own planes\\
265 - and yachts and chicks.\\
266 - And tons of pot. Chicks with pot.\\
267 - Chicks with pot in bikinis.\\
268 - Naked chicks with pot.\\
269 - On a yacht.\\
270 - I like that a lot.\\
271 - Uh-oh.\\
272 - That's not good.\\
273 - Yeah. Why are they all going bad at the same time?\\
274 - I don't know.\\
275 - It's like there's some sort of virus.\\
276 - Like the kind you get when you download too much...\\
277 - Uh-oh. Uh-oh.\\
278 - Maybe we should call Billy!\\
279 - No, we can do this!\\
280 - Okay, we can't do this.\\
281 - Call Billy! Call Billy!\\
282 - Hello?\\
283 - Billy, it's Jake.\\
284 - I just want to start once again\\
285 - by saying how grateful we are for this opportunity.\\
286 - It's great.\\
287 - How did this happen?\\
288 - Oh, I... I don't know.\\
289 - Well, faulty wiring or, uh, cheap hardware...\\
290 - Definitely not a porn virus.\\
291 - Shut up.\\
292 - How could you guys do this?\\
293 - I went out on a limb for you.\\
294 - I believed in you.\\
295 - Well, thank you.\\
296 - It was... it was a wonderful opportunity.\\
297 - Oh, great opportunity.\\
298 - So, when do we get paid?\\
299 - Okay.\\
300 - Yeah, you can't. I know their parents.\\
301 - Hey. What are you guys doing here?\\
302 - I thought your shift didn't end till 8:00 a.m.\\
303 - Well, we got done early.\\
304 - Oh. Everything go okay?\\
305 - I was kind of worried\\
306 - you might burn the whole place down or something.\\
307 - Well, it wasn't "or something."\\
308 - How am I supposed to find jobs in the next 24 hours?\\
309 - Beats me.\\
310 - It's like our parents are clueless\\
311 - about how bad the economy is.\\
312 - Yeah.\\
313 - You know what,\\
314 - instead of working for someone else,\\
315 - we should start our own business.\\
316 - I like that.\\
317 - We could find some adventure capitalists\\
318 - and become, um-- what do you call--\\
319 - entrepraneers.\\
320 - Yeah. It's not like we don't have our own good idea.\\
321 - We have great ideas.\\
322 - Hey, maybe we can put other food on a stick and sell it.\\
323 - Yeah. Pizza on a stick.\\
324 - Pizza sticks.\\
325 - Pie.\\
326 - Pie sticks.\\
327 - Fish.\\
328 - Yeah, what are we going to call those?\\
329 - Fish-sicles!\\
330 - Genius!\\
331 - Yeah.\\
332 - Excuse me.\\
333 - Did I hear you guys say\\
334 - you're looking for jobs?\\
335 - Yeah.\\
336 - Why?\\
337 - Maybe it's me.\\
338 - I'm an idiot magnet.\\
339 - Hey.\\
340 - Yup.\\
341 - Hi.\\
342 - How you doing?\\
343 - Not so good.\\
344 - Yeah, yeah, we heard, and we're so, so sorry.\\
345 - So, so very sorry.\\
346 - Yeah, well, thank God the files are backed up\\
347 - and insurance will cover most of the damage.\\
348 - That's great news!\\
349 - Yes. Phew!\\
350 - You do realize that your children are not normal.\\
351 - Well, yeah, but, you know, what's normal?\\
352 - And-and in Jake's defense,\\
353 - he never would have done anything like this\\
354 - unless, uh, you know.\\
355 - "You know" what, Alan?\\
356 - Well, I didn't want to, you know, say anything\\
357 - but, uh, but clearly there's a bad influence involved here.\\
358 - I mean, I don't want to point any fingers,\\
359 - but, uh, his name rhymes with "smeldridge."\\
360 - Oh, my God.\\
361 - You-you can't be serious.\\
362 - My son had never been in trouble in his life\\
363 - until he met your son.\\
364 - Never been in trouble?\\
365 - He tried to counterfeit money\\
366 - with a computer and an inkjet printer.\\
367 - The government dropped the charges.\\
368 - Only because there's no such thing\\
369 - as a $25 bill.\\
370 - Yeah? Yeah? Well,\\
371 - well, what about when Jake stole your brother's Mercedes\\
372 - and lost it in Topanga Canyon?\\
373 - He didn't steal it. He borrowed it.\\
374 - And he was only driving it because my brother was drunk\\
375 - and someone had to take his hooker home.\\
376 - In Topanga Canyon, which is where she lived.\\
377 - You are always making excuses for him.\\
378 - And you don't excuse Eldridge?\\
379 - Hey, he went through a very rough divorce.\\
380 - And Jake didn't?\\
381 - Well, at least your wife traded up.\\
382 - Wh-what is that supposed to mean?\\
383 - Really? That was too subtle for you?\\
384 - Hey, everybody, good news.\\
385 - You don't have to worry about us finding work.\\
386 - You-you got a job?\\
387 - Yeah. It's not just a job though.\\
388 - It's an adventure.\\
389 - What?\\
390 - We're gonna be all we can be.\\
391 - Oh, oh, no-no, you didn't.\\
392 - We didn't what?\\
393 - Join the Army.\\
394 - Yeah, we joined the Army. How'd you know?\\
395 - You need to listen to me.\\
396 - They are not normal.\\
397 - Uh, hiya.\\
398 - Hi.\\
399 - Looking for a new career?\\
400 - Um, I'm 44 years old.\\
401 - That's okay.\\
402 - Today's Army is all-inclusive.\\
403 - You can be as old and as gay as you want.\\
404 - Uh, well, that's-that's good to know.\\
405 - Um, uh, but I-I actually wanted to talk to you\\
406 - about my son, Jake Harper.\\
407 - Harper. Harper.\\
408 - Oh, yeah, wants to be a drone pilot.\\
409 - Yeah, he told me.\\
410 - He thinks it's like a video game.\\
411 - Oh, it is.\\
412 - It's exactly like a video game.\\
413 - Except we blow up real people.\\
414 - Yeah, actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.\\
415 - Um,\\
416 - I love my son,\\
417 - uh, but more importantly,\\
418 - I love my country,\\
419 - uh, which is why I don't think my son\\
420 - should have access to flying bombs.\\
421 - Or really any kind of weapon.\\
422 - I mean, between you and me,\\
423 - I've seen him try to pick up spilled food with a fork\\
424 - and stab himself in the leg.\\
425 - And not just once.\\
426 - I understand your concern, but our training is unsurpassed.\\
427 - We take boys and turn them into men.\\
428 - I know you think that...\\
429 - ...but you don't know him like I do.\\
430 - He's 18, right? Yeah.\\
431 - Not currently on probation or under indictment?\\
432 - No. Is this his signature?\\
433 - Yeah.\\
434 - Then if he passes the physical,\\
435 - he's signed, stamped, and off to camp.\\
436 - I see.\\
437 - Oh, look, al-Qaeda!\\
438 - It's just a copy!\\
439 - Hey, guys, you like video games?\\
440 - Congratulations, Jake.\\
441 - I know I'm only your stepdad, but I'm real proud of you.\\
442 - Thanks, Herb. Were you ever in the Army?\\
443 - Well, the KISS Army.\\
444 - But I don't think that really counts.\\
445 - You think Mom's ever gonna stop crying\\
446 - before I go?\\
447 - My guess is no.\\
448 - Don't worry, Mom.\\
449 - I'll be fine.\\
450 - I'm a grown man now.\\
451 - No, you're not.\\
452 - You're my bigheaded baby.\\
453 - So, Berta, are you gonna miss me?\\
454 - Nah, why should I miss you?\\
455 - You're just an extra toilet to clean.\\
456 - That is, when you hit the toilet.\\
457 - Don't worry, Grandma. I'll make you proud of me.\\
458 - I've always been proud of you, darling.\\
459 - In my own way.\\
460 - Thanks for everything.\\
461 - Come here.\\
462 - Look at the bright side, Dad.\\
463 - You won't have to buy me clothes anymore.\\
464 - They're gonna give me a dress uniform,\\
465 - a work uniform, and even one for when I'm tired.\\
466 - What?\\
467 - Yeah, they call 'em "fatigues."\\
468 - I don't know why they just wouldn't call 'em pajamas.\\
469 - Oh, my son, my son.\\
470 - You be a good boy, and you do what you're told,\\
471 - and promise me you'll be careful.\\
472 - Don't worry about me.\\
473 - Worry about our nation's enemies.\\
474 - I am worried.\\
475 -     Men.    \\
476 - Come on, you lazy pukes!\\
477 - Move it! Move it! Move it!\\
478 - When do we start flying the robot planes?\\
479 - I don't know.\\
480 - Maybe after lunch.\\
481 - No, we're going on a five-mile run after lunch.\\
482 - No, I'm gonna skip that.\\
483 - I want to take a nap.\\
