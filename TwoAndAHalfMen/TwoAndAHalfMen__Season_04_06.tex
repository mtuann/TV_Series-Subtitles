\subsection {Episode 01: Working for Caligula}
1 - Previously, on...\\
2 - I'm asking you to marry me.\\
3 - We might as well just go to Vegas and elope.\\
4 - If we're gonna have a family,\\
5 - we'll need to turn the second bedroom into a nursery.\\
6 - But that's where Jake stays.\\
7 - Yeah, but once Alan moves out,\\
8 - then Jake won't be staying there anymore, right?\\
9 - Alan's moving out?\\
10 - Of course he is.\\
11 - Isn't he?\\
12 - I said the wedding's off.\\
13 - Can I borrow your wedding ring? What for?\\
14 - Well, I thought, as long as we're in Vegas,\\
15 - I'd marry Kandi.\\
16 - (laughing)\\
17 - MAN: I now pronounce you man and wife.\\
18 - You may kiss the bride.\\
19 - I don't freakin' believe it.\\
20 - Cheer up, Charlie.\\
21 - You're finally getting what you always wanted--\\
22 - I'm moving out of your house!\\
23 - I don't freakin' believe it!\\
24 - Do we have time to play roulette before we go?\\
25 - Oh, honey, that is a sucker's game.\\
26 - The odds are totally stacked against y...\\
27 - Ooh, Super Slots O'Fun Jackpot.\\
28 - Sure, make the smart bet.\\
29 - Here, honey.\\
30 - Kiss it before I put it in.\\
31 - And the honeymoon begins.\\
32 - Slots O'Fun-- you get it?\\
33 - It's Slots O'Fun.\\
34 - I'm ready for a refill.\\
35 - Is that good?\\
36 - (bells ringing)\\
37 - I won.\\
38 - (laughing)\\
39 - I won a half a million dollars!\\
40 - (screaming)\\
41 - (both laughing)\\
42 - I don't freakin' believe it.\\
43 - Alan, you're rich!\\
44 - We're rich!\\
45 - We're married now-- what's mine is yours.\\
46 - Really?\\
47 - And the honeymoon ends.\\
48 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
49 - * Ah. * Men.*\\
50 - Uh, excuse me.\\
51 - Do you know where Charlie is?\\
52 - Who's Charlie?\\
53 - (knocking at door)\\
54 - Charlie?\\
55 - You in here?\\
56 - (laughing): Hey, Alan.\\
57 - Long time, no see.\\
58 - Say hello to my brother Alan.\\
59 - Hi, Alan.\\
60 - Hi, Alan.\\
61 - Hi, Alan.\\
62 - Um...\\
63 - I'm interrupting.\\
64 - Gee, do you think?\\
65 - Listen, I really need to talk to you.\\
66 - Can you come downstairs?\\
67 - Sure.\\
68 - Give me...\\
69 - ...an hour and a half.\\
70 - An hour and a half?!\\
71 - I know it's a little rushed,\\
72 - but we're on a tight schedule here.\\
73 - Tina's got homework,\\
74 - Cindy's got to meet her fianc  ,\\
75 - and Marie-- well, Marie's on the clock.\\
76 - You already had two women in bed\\
77 - Better safe than sorry.\\
78 - I see.\\
79 - Well, I guess I'll just wait downstairs.\\
80 - Good call.\\
81 - 'Cause, you know, five's a crowd.\\
82 - (door closes)\\
83 - Okay, does everybody remember their assignment?\\
84 - Uh-huh. Yep.\\
85 - Think so.\\
86 - Then let's do this thing.\\
87 - Hour and a half on the dot.\\
88 - Can I plan or what?\\
89 - Hey, come on.\\
90 - Show a little class.\\
91 - So, how's the newlywed?\\
92 - Still living the dream?\\
93 - Well... I got to tell you, buddy,\\
94 - things haven't been the same around here since you left.\\
95 - That's nice, but...\\
96 - Yeah, they've been way better.\\
97 - I mean, look around.\\
98 - I don't even know these people.\\
99 - Yeah, and I can have sex in every room in the house now.\\
100 - I had forgotten how much fun you can have\\
101 - on top of a washing machine.\\
102 - You know-- hibbe-dah, hibbe-dah, hibbe-dah, hibbe-dah.\\
103 - That does sound like fun, but...\\
104 - And the best part of all is, without Jake here,\\
105 - Mom has no reason to visit.\\
106 - Heck, I may not have to see her again till we meet in hell.\\
107 - I'm happy for you...\\
108 - Come to think of it, without Jake here,\\
109 - there's no reason for you to visit, either.\\
110 - I'm your brother.\\
111 - Yeah, so?\\
112 - I'm your brother-- I don't visit you.\\
113 - Charlie, listen to me.\\
114 - My wife threw me out.\\
115 - Aw, dude...\\
116 - that's awful.\\
117 - Yeah.\\
118 - Well, thanks for stopping by.\\
119 - Aren't you listening to me?\\
120 - Kandi doesn't love me anymore.\\
121 - My marriage is over.\\
122 - My life is in ruins.\\
123 - Whoa.\\
124 - What?\\
125 - D  j   vu.\\
126 - It's as if I've lived through this before\\
127 - and didn't really enjoy it.\\
128 - Charlie, I...\\
129 - But wait, there's a difference.\\
130 - This time, you can get your own place\\
131 - instead of sponging off me,\\
132 - 'cause you have money now, right?\\
133 - Uh, well...\\
134 - Oh, you suck!\\
135 - It wasn't my fault.\\
136 - There were taxes and the condo\\
137 - and Kandi's new car and Kandi's new clothes\\
138 - and the shoes.\\
139 - Oh, God, so many shoes.\\
140 - How much do you have left?\\
141 - Eleven dollars.\\
142 - Okay, okay, let's start from the beginning.\\
143 - Well, things were fine until about a month ago.\\
144 - No, no, no, no, no.\\
145 - I'll go back upstairs, you come knock on my door again\\
146 - and say you want to talk to me.\\
147 - Only this time, I'll kill you!\\
148 - Oh, come on.\\
149 - You're all I have left in this world.\\
150 - I need you, Charlie!\\
151 - Anybody here know a Charlie?\\
152 - * Men. *\\
153 - Ah, geez.\\
154 - I'm working for Caligula.\\
155 - Hi, Berta.\\
156 - Hey, Zippy.\\
157 - What are you doing here?\\
158 - My marriage is over.\\
159 - Kandi kicked me out.\\
160 - Damn, that's horrible.\\
161 - Yeah.\\
162 - Damn, damn, damn!\\
163 - Tell me about it.\\
164 - I had October in the pool.\\
165 - Pool? What-what-what pool?\\
166 - Me, your brother, your mom, a couple of neighbors,\\
167 - had a pool on how long before she dumped your ass.\\
168 - I was so close!\\
169 - You were betting that my marriage was going to fail?\\
170 - No.\\
171 - We were betting on when.\\
172 - So Charlie took you back, huh?\\
173 - Well, not with open arms or an open heart\\
174 - or even an open door.\\
175 - After he pushed me out, I had to climb in through the window.\\
176 - But yeah, I'm back.\\
177 - Well, I'm glad.\\
178 - You're kidding.\\
179 - No.\\
180 - With you and the kid around,\\
181 - I won't have to hose down the washing machine so often.\\
182 - (doorbell rings)\\
183 - I'll get that.\\
184 - I guess there's no trusting this butter now.\\
185 - Or the loose bananas.\\
186 - Hello, Alan.\\
187 - Judith.\\
188 - Hey, Dad.\\
189 - Hey, buddy.\\
190 - So is somebody going to explain to me what the heck is going on?\\
191 - I thought he should hear it from you.\\
192 - (sighs): Okay.\\
193 - Jake, listen,\\
194 - I know you liked Kandi very much,\\
195 - but she and I have decided that we really can't stay married.\\
196 - Ah, man!\\
197 - That doesn't mean that you can't be friends with her.\\
198 - No. I had December.\\
199 - Alan, I just want to say I'm very sorry\\
200 - things didn't work out for you and Kandi.\\
201 - Thanks.\\
202 - You won the pool, didn't you?\\
203 - Yeah.\\
204 - And just FYI, I spoke to my lawyer,\\
205 - and he said that even if Kandi takes you\\
206 - for everything you've got, you still have to pay me alimony.\\
207 - Here's his bill.\\
208 - (scoffs)\\
209 - Six hundred dollars?!\\
210 - He explained it very slowly.\\
211 - You didn't call.\\
212 - What?\\
213 - When Dad moved out, you said you and me\\
214 - could still get together and do stuff.\\
215 - But you never called.\\
216 - Ah, geez, Jake, I'm sorry.\\
217 - I waited.\\
218 - I'll make it up to you.\\
219 - When?\\
220 - Later.\\
221 - I'm still here.\\
222 - What do you want me to do, Jake?\\
223 - I don't know.\\
224 - You really let me down, and it hurt my feelings.\\
225 - I know. I feel awful.\\
226 - Fifty bucks and it goes away.\\
227 - Ten. Done.\\
228 - Love you, Uncle Charlie.\\
229 - Back at you.\\
230 - * Men. *\\
231 - How long is he going to sit out there?\\
232 - I don't know, Jake.\\
233 - He's pretty depressed.\\
234 - Yeah, well, that's the price you pay\\
235 - when you think with your penis.\\
236 - Did you hear that from your mother?\\
237 - No, your mother.\\
238 - And how are you feeling about all this?\\
239 - I'm okay.\\
240 - You sure?\\
241 - Uncle Charlie,\\
242 - this is not my first divorce.\\
243 - Got it.\\
244 - Tell you one thing, though-- I am never getting married.\\
245 - That's a sweet dream to have, Jake.\\
246 - But sooner or later,\\
247 - you're going to meet a girl who's smart, beautiful,\\
248 - and has a real grudge against your parents.\\
249 - What are you going to do then?\\
250 - Don't worry. I have a plan.\\
251 - Really?\\
252 - Yeah. If a girl falls in love with me,\\
253 - I'll tell her I can't marry her until I have enough money,\\
254 - even though I'll be secretly rich.\\
255 - How do you plan to get secretly rich?\\
256 - I'm going to marry a movie star.\\
257 - You're going to marry a movie star\\
258 - to avoid getting married?\\
259 - Guess I haven't worked out all the bugs.\\
260 - Well, keep me posted.\\
261 - Hey.\\
262 - Hey.\\
263 - Jake sure changed in the last few months.\\
264 - Starting to see a real little man there.\\
265 - Mm-hmm.\\
266 - Not a real bright little man.\\
267 - What you doing?\\
268 - Making plans.\\
269 - Do they involve marrying a movie star?\\
270 - What?\\
271 - Nothing, nothing. What's your plan?\\
272 - Well, I figured I'd have a nice big lunch,\\
273 - get real drunk, stroll down to the beach,\\
274 - and try to swim to Japan.\\
275 - Huh.\\
276 - Why the lunch?\\
277 - I want to cramp up and drown\\
278 - before the sharks rip me to shreds.\\
279 - Well, keep me posted.\\
280 - I'm a failure, Charlie.\\
281 - Everything I've tried to do in my life has ended\\
282 - in complete abject failure.\\
283 - Oh, buddy, you're looking at this the wrong way.\\
284 - See?\\
285 - I've failed again.\\
286 - Will you shut up and listen to me?\\
287 - Failure is nothing to be ashamed of.\\
288 - It's a part of life, it's how we learn.\\
289 - Well, you know what?\\
290 - I've failed for almost 40 years.\\
291 - And what have I learned?\\
292 - Oh, that wasn't a rhetorical question?\\
293 - Come on, Alan.\\
294 - You got to have a sense of humor about this.\\
295 - A broke-ass, middle-aged guy\\
296 - marries a 22-year-old knucklehead\\
297 - just before he wins a half a million dollars.\\
298 - And then she takes him for everything he's got.\\
299 - (chuckles)\\
300 - That's hilarious.\\
301 - Okay, okay.\\
302 - Okay, maybe you're too close to it now,\\
303 - but trust me, it's funny.\\
304 - (inhales deeply)\\
305 - Hmm.\\
306 - Where are you going?\\
307 - The ocean's that way.\\
308 - * Men. *\\
309 - (knock at door)\\
310 - Hey, the kid and I are going to the movies.\\
311 - You want to come? No, thanks.\\
312 - Can I get you something to eat? No.\\
313 - Something to drink?\\
314 - No.\\
315 - How about a bottle of Scotch and a hooker?\\
316 - I just want to be alone.\\
317 - Well, you don't need my help for that.\\
318 - That's your home run swing.\\
319 - Just close the door on the way out.\\
320 - Fine, I'll close it.\\
321 - Then I'll nail it shut and plaster it over\\
322 - and hang a picture of something a little more cheerful,\\
323 - like a plane crash.\\
324 - Okay.\\
325 - I am through feeling sorry for myself.\\
326 - Maybe not.\\
327 - (knock at door)\\
328 - Alan?\\
329 - Oh, terrific.\\
330 - Charlie told me about you and Candy.\\
331 - I'm so sorry.\\
332 - Yeah, well, thanks.\\
333 - Did he also tell you I want to be alone?\\
334 - Yes, he did, so...\\
335 - want some company?\\
336 - No.\\
337 - How about a hug?\\
338 - Is it a good-bye hug?\\
339 - Alan, I know what it's like to lose at love.\\
340 - Rose?\\
341 - Yes, baby?\\
342 - You're a stalker.\\
343 - I prefer to be called boundary-challenged.\\
344 - Just go away.\\
345 - Go away?!\\
346 - (laughs)\\
347 - Alan, I'm a stalker.\\
348 - Trust me.\\
349 - This pain will pass.\\
350 - The aching emptiness\\
351 - that's swallowing up your heart will be transformed\\
352 - into something beautiful.\\
353 - What's that?\\
354 - Resentment.\\
355 - A burning, white hot resentment\\
356 - that empowers you to commit unspeakable acts of revenge.\\
357 - You're going to want a scrapbook.\\
358 - * Men. *\\
359 - Dad?\\
360 - Yeah.\\
361 - Uncle Charlie's going to take me back to Mom's now.\\
362 - Well, come in here and say good-bye.\\
363 - Bye.\\
364 - That's it? Come here and give your old dad a hug.\\
365 - That's better.\\
366 - You still depressed?\\
367 - Oh, no, no, I'm fine.\\
368 - Just taking a little nap.\\
369 - You've been napping for two days.\\
370 - I'm getting old, Jake.\\
371 - Old people nap a lot.\\
372 - It's kind of a dry run for death.\\
373 - Okay.\\
374 - Well, see you.\\
375 - See you.\\
376 - Hey, Dad?\\
377 - Yeah?\\
378 - Even though Mom stopped loving you\\
379 - and Kandi stopped loving you,\\
380 - you don't have to worry about me.\\
381 - Thanks, pal.\\
382 - You're my dad. I pretty much got to love you.\\
383 - So?\\
384 - Is he still curled up like a cocktail shrimp?\\
385 - Yep.\\
386 - This is a real fun weekend.\\
387 - Wait in the car, Jake, and I'll be right there.\\
388 - Okay. I am running out of patience with this guy.\\
389 - I've had relationships end,\\
390 - and I don't go crawling into bed over it.\\
391 - (clears throat)\\
392 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what I mean.\\
393 - It may not be just the relationship.\\
394 - What are you talking about?\\
395 - Charlie, I've studied psychology for eight years\\
396 - and been a patient for 20.\\
397 - Your brother is exhibiting all the classic signs\\
398 - of clinical depression.\\
399 - What are you saying? You think he might try to hurt himself?\\
400 - The important question is, do we stop him?\\
401 - Oh, like I'm the only one here thinking that.\\
402 - All right, I didn't want to have to do this,\\
403 - but desperate times call for desperate measures.\\
404 - What are you going to do? Something I hoped I'd never have to.\\
405 - You don't mean...?\\
406 - I'm afraid so.\\
407 - Hello?\\
408 - Mom?\\
409 - (knock at door)\\
410 - Oh, God, what plague have you set upon me now?\\
411 - Alan, it's Mommy.\\
412 - Good one.\\
413 - Oh, my poor darling.\\
414 - How are you holding up?\\
415 - How do you think?\\
416 - I blew another marriage.\\
417 - I wasted all my money.\\
418 - I'm a complete and utter failure.\\
419 - Oh, sweetie, you just can't see\\
420 - the big picture, can you?\\
421 - What big picture?\\
422 - Every foolish choice you've made,\\
423 - every wasted opportunity,\\
424 - every hapless misstep in your sad, misbegotten life...\\
425 - I know, I know...\\
426 - It's an opportunity to learn and grow.\\
427 - Well, perhaps, but more importantly,\\
428 - it's a reflection on me.\\
429 - Always good to see you, Mom.\\
430 - I'm not finished. Of course not.\\
431 - There is a silver lining in this dark cloud.\\
432 - I can't wait to hear about it.\\
433 - (clears throat)\\
434 - You're all alone, you're penniless,\\
435 - and you have no prospects.\\
436 - Are we at the silver lining part yet?\\
437 - Yes. Short of contracting a flesh-eating disease,\\
438 - things couldn't possibly get any worse.\\
439 - You've hit rock bottom.\\
440 - You have nowhere to go but up.\\
441 - You know what?\\
442 - You're right.\\
443 - You're self-obsessed, insensitive and soul-sucking,\\
444 - but you're right.\\
445 - I have stared into the abyss,\\
446 - and I'm still here.\\
447 - I-I've had my heart shattered,\\
448 - and then... and then shattered again,\\
449 - and I'm still here.\\
450 - I've taken every piece of crap that life could throw at me,\\
451 - and I'm still here.\\
452 - Well, we don't have to turn this\\
453 - into an evening with Liza Minnelli.\\
454 - Now, get washed, get dressed,\\
455 - get on with your life.\\
456 - Okay.\\
457 - And remember, no matter what,\\
458 - I'll always love you.\\
459 - I know. Thanks.\\
460 - Oh, don't thank me, sweetheart.\\
461 - I'm your mother.\\
462 - I have to love you.\\
463 - * Men. *\\
464 - Hey.\\
465 - Hey.\\
466 - Thanks for taking Jake back to Judith's.\\
467 - No problem.\\
468 - Sorry I had to send Mom in there.\\
469 - No, no, you, uh... you did the right thing.\\
470 - I needed a good slap in the face.\\
471 - Although, with Mom,\\
472 - it's more like a nail gun to the testicles.\\
473 - That was my thinking.\\
474 - Well, uh... I'm really grateful.\\
475 - Don't mention it.\\
476 - So, look at us, huh?\\
477 - Just like old times.\\
478 - (laughs)\\
479 - Yep.\\
480 - The Harper brothers, together again.\\
481 - (laughs)\\
482 - Uh-huh.\\
483 - The chicks will come and go,\\
484 - but you and I will always be there for each other.\\
485 - Sure.\\
486 - Forever.\\
487 - Well, you know, not...\\
488 - not literally till the end of time,\\
489 - but, you know, till one of us dies.\\
490 - It'll probably be you,\\
491 - 'cause you don't take very good care of yourself.\\
492 - Gotcha.\\
493 - Fist me.\\
494 - You want me to fist you?\\
495 - You know, like the, the bros in the hood.\\
496 - We're the bros, and this is our hood.\\
497 - (laughs)\\
498 - Pow! Right on.\\
499 - Tell you what.\\
500 - I will grab us a couple of brewskis\\
501 - so that Team Harper can kick back and chill.\\
502 - Terrific.\\
503 - Uh,\\
504 - but I'll get you a beer.\\
505 - Okay.\\
506 - Oh, uh, maybe I'll make a nice little plate\\
507 - of cheese and crackers.\\
508 - Hmm, nothing fancy.\\
509 - Good.\\
510 - Ooh. Uh, I don't suppose you have any brie?\\
511 - I don't know.\\
512 - Not important.\\
513 - You relax.\\
514 - I got you covered. Pow!\\
515 - * Men. *
\subsection {Episode 02: Who's Vod Kanockers}
1 - "Mudslide Kills 600 Religious Pilgrims."\\
2 - And yet, both my ex-wives live on.\\
3 - Morning.\\
4 - Morning. Uh-oh.\\
5 - Not again. Please, not again.\\
6 - Thank God.\\
7 - Always in the last place you look, huh?\\
8 - Uh-huh.\\
9 - Have a nice day.\\
10 - (weakly): You, too.\\
11 - Yeah, Phil, it's Charlie.\\
12 - Put me down for a grand on Detroit tonight.\\
13 - What's the line now?\\
14 - Well, excuse me.\\
15 - But don't you think if the gambler is awake,\\
16 - it behooves the bookie to be up as well?\\
17 - All right, well, call me when you get off the can.\\
18 - Are you aware that your sleepover buddy\\
19 - was packing heat? Oh, yeah.\\
20 - Any hotter and she'd have burned my pubes clean off.\\
21 - Charlie, a gun in the house?\\
22 - Relax, she's a cop.\\
23 - Or was a cop.\\
24 - Or is wanted by the cops.\\
25 - I know she mentioned cops.\\
26 - Unbelievable. So this was another one-night stand?\\
27 - Unless she comes back for her handcuffs, yeah.\\
28 - Boy, how much satisfaction can you get from that?\\
29 - Handcuffs?\\
30 - Not really my thing.\\
31 - But, hey, she probably did some stuff last night\\
32 - that might not have been her first choice.\\
33 - No, I mean,\\
34 - how can you possibly get any satisfaction\\
35 - from an endless series of alcohol-soaked one-night stands?\\
36 - And even as the words are coming out of my mouth\\
37 - I realize it's a stupid question, so forget I said it.\\
38 - She's married to a cop.\\
39 - You know, I hate to see you wasting your life\\
40 - having drunken sex with women you don't care about.\\
41 - Well, who asked you to move back in and watch?\\
42 - You know who was good for you?\\
43 - Don't go there, Alan.\\
44 - Mia.\\
45 - She was beautiful, she was smart.\\
46 - She got you to clean up your act.\\
47 - I'm telling you, Charlie, letting her go\\
48 - was the stupidest thing you've ever done.\\
49 - You're going there, Alan.\\
50 - I'm just saying you had this fantastic woman\\
51 - who was willing to marry you and you just threw it away.\\
52 - And for what?\\
53 - Okay, you're there.\\
54 - You want to know why I gave up Mia?\\
55 - I'll tell you why I gave up Mia.\\
56 - I gave her up for you.\\
57 - Oh, oh, for me? Yeah.\\
58 - Yeah, for you.\\
59 - She wanted you to move out so we'd have the house\\
60 - to ourselves, but I said no way.\\
61 - I am not throwing my brother out on the street.\\
62 - Wow.\\
63 - What a loving gesture.\\
64 - Oh, bite me.\\
65 - And you know what you did?\\
66 - You married Candy and moved out anyway.\\
67 - So if you want to know\\
68 - why I let the best thing that ever happened to me get away,\\
69 - it's so the worst thing that could ever happen to me\\
70 - would have a place to live.\\
71 - Oh.\\
72 - (mimics): Oh.\\
73 - Well, I...\\
74 - I guess it all worked out for the best, huh?\\
75 - How do you figure?\\
76 - Well, think about it.\\
77 - If Mia had been living here when Candy kicked me out\\
78 - and I came back...\\
79 - would've been a very awkward situation.\\
80 - Oh!\\
81 - ALAN: Charlie?\\
82 - Huh?\\
83 - Oh. Yeah.\\
84 - Awkward.\\
85 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
86 - *Ah. * Men. *\\
87 - not my psychiatrist.\\
88 - If I want to bet every single game in the country\\
89 - with money I don't have, that's my business.\\
90 - Thank you.\\
91 - Now, let's talk boxing.\\
92 - Really?\\
93 - There's no fights anywhere tonight?\\
94 - Okay, well, how are you and your wife getting along?\\
95 - What? It'd be a fair fight.\\
96 - She's got, like, 50 pounds on you.\\
97 - Hello?\\
98 - My luck. I got to have a bookie\\
99 - who's afraid to fight out of his weight class.\\
100 - Aren't you a little worried that all this betting\\
101 - might be turning into a problem?\\
102 - Alan, if you don't bet big,\\
103 - you can't cover your losses.\\
104 - And if you can't cover your losses,\\
105 - a large man with a tire iron\\
106 - puts your address into MapQuest, at which point,\\
107 - you have to sneak across the Mexican border\\
108 - dressed in women's clothing.\\
109 - Now that's when you have a problem.\\
110 - Well, you know best.\\
111 - You hungry?\\
112 - I made your favorite sandwich.\\
113 - Turkey, ham and pastrami.\\
114 - Gobble. (snorts) (moos)\\
115 - No, thanks.\\
116 - Okay. Uh, how about something sweet?\\
117 - Key lime pie.\\
118 - Yummy, yummy.\\
119 - Look, Alan, I appreciate your sucking up,\\
120 - but you can't fill the gaping wound in my heart\\
121 - with deli meat.\\
122 - And pie.\\
123 - Yummy.\\
124 - Can't we just leave it alone?\\
125 - Can we not grind on and on\\
126 - about the stupidest thing I've ever done?\\
127 - Okay, okay, I'm sorry I said that.\\
128 - Giving up Mia was not\\
129 - the stupidest thing you've ever done.\\
130 - It certainly wasn't as stupid as when you came back from Rio\\
131 - with that gorgeous model-- you know, the one\\
132 - with the Adam's apple and the really big hands?\\
133 - You know, I'm going to give you some space.\\
134 - I'll maybe go for a nice drive.\\
135 - (sighs)\\
136 - (door opens)\\
137 - Forgot my keys.\\
138 - Aah! Oh!\\
139 - Uh, you know what?\\
140 - They-They must have slipped out\\
141 - of my pocket and into the couch.\\
142 - Um...\\
143 - Excuse me. Sorry.\\
144 - (grunting)\\
145 - Right. Sorry.\\
146 - (grunting)\\
147 - Oh.\\
148 - Found some change.\\
149 - Oh, uh, look.\\
150 - Is that a quarter in your ear?\\
151 - (groaning)\\
152 - (grunting)\\
153 - Tada!\\
154 - Very impressive.\\
155 - * Men.\\
156 - MAN: * Hey-eh, he-ee, ya-ah, oh-oh\\
157 - * Hey-ey, he-ee, ya-ah, oh-oh, oh *\\
158 - (high-pitched): * Ahh...\\
159 - (man scat singing scales)\\
160 - What is that?\\
161 - Steven Tyler rented the house next door.\\
162 - (singing continues)\\
163 - The-The guy from Aerosmith?\\
164 - I lost my virginity to him.\\
165 - You-You know, his music.\\
166 - Thanks. I was confused.\\
167 - (loud, howling scat singing)\\
168 - Apparently getting ready for a tour.\\
169 - So what's...?\\
170 - (loud scat singing continues)\\
171 - ...in the box?\\
172 - Oh, I just went out and picked you up a little something\\
173 - I thought might put a smile on your face.\\
174 - Alan, the only thing in this box\\
175 - that could possibly put a smile on my face is your severed head.\\
176 - (laughing)\\
177 - Good one.\\
178 - Zing!\\
179 - Come on, open it.\\
180 - (scat singing continues)\\
181 - A hat?\\
182 - A very expensive hat.\\
183 - Since when do I wear hats?\\
184 - Well, you don't, but, uh, I saw it, and it seemed so you.\\
185 - You know, cool, rakish, yet, forgiving.\\
186 - Okay, fine, I forgive you.\\
187 - Oh, thanks. Thanks.\\
188 - Aren't you going to try it on?\\
189 - No.\\
190 - If you really forgave me, you'd try it on.\\
191 - (sighs) (scat singing continues in distance)\\
192 - Oh, yeah.\\
193 - That is you.\\
194 - Let's, uh, let's try tilting it a little bit here.\\
195 - Oh, baby.\\
196 - (laughing): You got to see this.\\
197 - Yeah, come on inside, we'll take a look.\\
198 - Charlie, you coming?\\
199 - What's going on?\\
200 - You should leave, Alan.\\
201 - Why?\\
202 - Just trust me.\\
203 - All right.\\
204 - (scat singing continues)\\
205 - (scat singing continues loudly)\\
206 - Hey, Tyler, take a pause for the cause!\\
207 - Ah, sorry, man.\\
208 - (shouting): Thank you and good night!\\
209 - Hi, Charlie.\\
210 - Rose.\\
211 - How cool is it that Steven Tyler moved in next door?\\
212 - I lost my virginity to him.\\
213 - You mean his music?\\
214 - No.\\
215 - Nice hat.\\
216 - Thanks.\\
217 - Boy, you look like hell.\\
218 - Well, that's strange, 'cause I feel like crap.\\
219 - How long do you think you can keep it up?\\
220 - What exactly are we talking about?\\
221 - The excessive drinking, the obsessive partying,\\
222 - the compulsive gambling.\\
223 - Oh. Hard to say.\\
224 - I try and take it one day at a time.\\
225 - You do realize\\
226 - this is all just an attempt to avoid feeling your feelings.\\
227 - Let me tell you something about feelings.\\
228 - Feelings are like your mother's breasts.\\
229 - You know where they are, but they're best left unfelt.\\
230 - It's an interesting analogy, but may I point out\\
231 - that a mother's breasts are a source\\
232 - of nourishment and comfort?\\
233 - Yeah, well, my mother's breasts were a source\\
234 - of silicone and Russian vodka.\\
235 - Not good for child-rearing,\\
236 - but she was a big hit at parties.\\
237 - Charlie, I know how much it hurt you to give up Mia,\\
238 - and I know you don't like that feeling,\\
239 - but the more you try to get rid of it,\\
240 - the more it's going to come back.\\
241 - Oh, yeah.\\
242 - Perfect fit.\\
243 - It's like somebody measured your head while you were asleep\\
244 - so when your brother called she could tell him the size.\\
245 - * Men.\\
246 - Hey, Uncle Charlie, guess where I'm finally growing hair.\\
247 - Come on, man, I'm eating.\\
248 - Right here.\\
249 - I'm growing a 'stache.\\
250 - Oh, yeah.\\
251 - Look at that.\\
252 - Hey, cool hat. Whose is it?\\
253 - Yours.\\
254 - Really? Yeah.\\
255 - It looks great with the 'stache.\\
256 - You know, it just occurred to me\\
257 - that I have been feeling guilty\\
258 - because you called off your wedding to Mia\\
259 - so that I wouldn't have to move out.\\
260 - But then when I did move out,\\
261 - you didn't call her.\\
262 - Yeah, so?\\
263 - So, you know why I think you didn't call her?\\
264 - You didn't call her because the whole\\
265 - I don't want to throw my brother out on the street business\\
266 - was a very convenient and noble excuse\\
267 - to get out of the marriage.\\
268 - That's what you think, huh?\\
269 - Yes, that's what I think. That's what you think?\\
270 - You heard me. That's what I think.\\
271 - Yeah, well... think again.\\
272 - Admit it, Charlie, I've been beating myself up,\\
273 - buying you pie and hats\\
274 - for nothing.\\
275 - (deep voice): There's pie?\\
276 - There was. Berta ate it.\\
277 - And-And... And why is he wearing your hat?\\
278 - I gave it to him.\\
279 - I bought this hat for you.\\
280 - And I gave it to Jake.\\
281 - You can't commit to anything, can you?\\
282 - It's just a hat!\\
283 - It's not just a hat. It's a symbol.\\
284 - Of what?\\
285 - Of...\\
286 - Okay, it's just a hat, but\\
287 - the point is, you have nobody to blame\\
288 - for your miserable, lonely existence but yourself.\\
289 - And you can drink, gamble and hump all you want,\\
290 - but one day, you're going to have to face that fact.\\
291 - Drink, gamble and hump!\\
292 - Yeah, well, I don't have to face anything\\
293 - I don't want to face,\\
294 - and I don't have to feel anything I don't want to feel,\\
295 - and that includes Mom's vodka knockers.\\
296 - Who is this Vod Kanockers that you speak of?\\
297 - Eat your dinner.\\
298 - The name's Kanockers.\\
299 - Vod Kanockers.\\
300 - * Men.\\
301 - Charlie?\\
302 - Shh.\\
303 - You okay?\\
304 - Just dandy.\\
305 - Would you close the blinds?\\
306 - Come on, let's get you inside.\\
307 - Looks like you had a tough night.\\
308 - (grunts)\\
309 - No, the night was great.\\
310 - It's the morning that's killing me.\\
311 - Hey, Alan?\\
312 - What?\\
313 - You were right.\\
314 - I can't keep running away from my feelings.\\
315 - Well, I'm glad you realize that.\\
316 - You're a wonderful brother.\\
317 - And this is a beautiful hat.\\
318 - Thank you.\\
319 - (Charlie retching)\\
320 - Charlie, you okay?\\
321 - I'm fine.\\
322 - The hat's not so good.\\
323 - * Men.\\
324 - Hey, Berta, want to see my armpit hair?\\
325 - Only if you want to see mine.\\
326 - Hey.\\
327 - Hey.\\
328 - You know that's my juice.\\
329 - I know.\\
330 - You could at least ask.\\
331 - You could at least pay rent.\\
332 - Touch  .\\
333 - (phone ringing)\\
334 - If that's a bookie or a woman, you know what to say.\\
335 - Harper residence.\\
336 - Sorry, he's dead.\\
337 - Interesting. No one ever calls back\\
338 - to find out where to send flowers.\\
339 - Touch  .\\
340 - BERTA: How's it feel to go\\
341 - a whole week without booze, broads or betting?\\
342 - It's actually kind of a relief.\\
343 - I never realized how much effort it took\\
344 - to avoid feeling anything.\\
345 - Yeah? Well, what are you feeling now?\\
346 - So far, mostly nausea and boredom.\\
347 - Touch  .\\
348 - You don't know what that means, do you?\\
349 - Not a clue.\\
350 - Hey, if girls with big boobs work at Hooters,\\
351 - where do girls with only one leg work at?\\
352 - Ihop!\\
353 - That's just cruel.\\
354 - (chuckling): Actually, it's kind of funny.\\
355 - Yeah, 'cause they got one leg, they have to hop.\\
356 - Right. I hop.\\
357 - (laughing)\\
358 - Tipping your waitress takes on a whole new meaning.\\
359 - (laughing)\\
360 - It's not that funny.\\
361 - I know.\\
362 - Then why are you laughing so much?\\
363 - I don't know.\\
364 - Dad, something's wrong with Uncle Charlie.\\
365 - What's going on?\\
366 - (laughing): Hey, Jake,\\
367 - tell your dad\\
368 - how one-legged girls work at Ihop.\\
369 - Oh, no.\\
370 - I gave away the joke.\\
371 - I'm so sorry, Jake.\\
372 - (voice breaking): I've ruined everything.\\
373 - Is he okay?\\
374 - He's fine. His feelings are coming to the surface.\\
375 - Oh, like when Mom gets PMS.\\
376 - Well, kind of.\\
377 - Hang on, Uncle Charlie.\\
378 - I'll get you some chocolate.\\
379 - * Men.\\
380 - What's he making out there?\\
381 - A lanyard.\\
382 - He's got a lot of free time now,\\
383 - so I gave him one of Jake's old hobby kits.\\
384 - You know, so he'd have something to do.\\
385 - I'm surprised he's not making a vagina\\
386 - out of macaroni and bottle caps.\\
387 - Over, loop, around.\\
388 - 'Round the block and then downtown.\\
389 - (harmonica playing blues)\\
390 - Over, over.\\
391 - Loop, around.\\
392 - 'Round the block, and then...\\
393 - Yo, dude, some of us are trying to do crafts here!\\
394 - TYLER: What?!\\
395 - Can you lay off the harmonica-playing?\\
396 - Hey, a lot of people pay to see me play harmonica.\\
397 - They pay to hear you sing.\\
398 - They tolerate the harmonica!\\
399 - Sorry I don't measure up to your musical standards,\\
400 - you lame ass jingle-writer!\\
401 - All right, let's see\\
402 - how you play harmonica out your other end.\\
403 - Now, now, now, now, let's slow down here. Come on.\\
404 - TYLER: Let's see what you've got, jingle balls.\\
405 - Okay, I'm gonna rip off your big, fat lips\\
406 - and use 'em to kiss my ass!\\
407 - Charlie, please, please.\\
408 - You know your emotions are a little bit frayed right now.\\
409 - Right, right. Okay, okay.\\
410 - I'm better.\\
411 - (Tyler imitating chicken)\\
412 - That's it!\\
413 - No, Charlie. Charlie, wait!\\
414 - Charlie, don't do this!\\
415 - CHARLIE: Come on, Tyler, you want a piece of me?\\
416 - You know, the dude may look like a lady,\\
417 - but you fight like a little girl.\\
418 - Did it ever occur to you to help me out?\\
419 - Well, yeah, but once you were cowering\\
420 - under his picnic table, I figured the worst was over.\\
421 - Oh, quick thinking squirting that bottle of sunblock at him.\\
422 - I was hoping it would get in his eyes and blind him.\\
423 - Yeah, well, all you did was keep him\\
424 - from getting a nasty burn while he beat the crap out of you.\\
425 - Please, Alan, I'm begging you.\\
426 - Okay. It's not right to kick a man when he's down.\\
427 - Thanks.\\
428 - Too bad Steven Tyler didn't feel that way, huh?\\
429 - You were right about Mia.\\
430 - I got cold feet, so I used you as an excuse\\
431 - to call off the wedding.\\
432 - I am so proud of you, Charlie.\\
433 - This-This is a real breakthrough.\\
434 - Doesn't it feel liberating\\
435 - to finally hear yourself admit the truth?\\
436 - Well, I feel something.\\
437 - But since I'm also hearing a high-pitched whistle,\\
438 - it might just be a concussion.\\
439 - * Men.\\
440 - What you making?\\
441 - A needlepoint sampler.\\
442 - No kidding.\\
443 - I find it very calming, and the message helps center me.\\
444 - "God bless Vicoden?"\\
445 - Pretty good, huh?\\
446 - You spelled Vicodin wrong.\\
447 - (knock at door)\\
448 - That's the great thing about Vicodin.\\
449 - I don't care.\\
450 - Hey, is Charlie here?\\
451 - Uh, who may I say is calling?\\
452 - It's okay, Alan.\\
453 - Hey, Chazz, thanks for the gift.\\
454 - You're welcome.\\
455 - So no hard feelings?\\
456 - Nah. You?\\
457 - Why would I have hard feelings?\\
458 - I'm still pickin' pieces of your ass out of my boot.\\
459 - Good one.\\
460 - Okay, well,\\
461 - good luck with the tour.\\
462 - Thanks a lot, man.\\
463 - Who's the sponsor? Metamucil?\\
464 - What was that?\\
465 - Nothing, nothing.\\
466 - Um, I just want to say, I'm a huge fan.\\
467 - Um, I lost my virginity to you. Really?\\
468 - Well, you know,\\
469 - there's a lot of the '70s I don't remember.\\
470 - Isn't that the hat I got you?\\
471 - Yeah.\\
472 - The hat you threw up in?\\
473 - I had it cleaned...\\
474 - but I'll always know.
\subsection {Episode 03: The Sea Is a Harsh Mistress}
1 - Yo, dude, what up?\\
2 - Just follow my lead.\\
3 - Oh, this is awesome.\\
4 - Eh, it's just a little surf shack\\
5 - where I keep my board, beer and brother.\\
6 - How they breakin' today, Bro-heim?\\
7 - How are what breaking?\\
8 - He smokes way too much weed.\\
9 - The waves, Poindexter.\\
10 - Oh, oh, the waves...\\
11 - the waves are...\\
12 - knarly?\\
13 - Well, all right, let's hit it.\\
14 - Oh, I intend to.\\
15 - Why don't you head out. I'll throw on my suit\\
16 - and meet you there. Awesome.\\
17 - Mm, bodacious and tubular.\\
18 - Uh, excuse me, Moon Doggie--\\
19 - quick question.\\
20 - Yeah.\\
21 - You don't surf, do you?\\
22 - Not a bit.\\
23 - So how did Gidget get the idea you were the Big Kahuna?\\
24 - I hold her I hang ten,\\
25 - and I guess she misunderstood.\\
26 - You're going to Hell, you know.\\
27 - I don't think so.\\
28 - I believe in a loving God who forgives little fibs\\
29 - as long as they lead to recreational sex.\\
30 - You really want to drag God into this?\\
31 - Who gave me the penis, Alan?\\
32 - Since when do you have a wet suit?\\
33 - Since I moved to the beach\\
34 - and noticed it was full of hot surfer chicks.\\
35 - If I lived next to Jellystone Park,\\
36 - I'd have a bear suit and a "pic-a-nic" basket.\\
37 - Would you get the door?\\
38 - (glass breaking)\\
39 - Oopsie.\\
40 - Smooth.\\
41 - So just out of curiosity,\\
42 - how exactly do you plan to pull this off?\\
43 - Simple-- paddle out,\\
44 - yell "shark" and paddle in.\\
45 - So you've thought this through?\\
46 - I'm not an idiot.\\
47 - (glass breaking)\\
48 - Whoopsie.\\
49 - Over here.\\
50 - What happened?\\
51 - I don't know. (coughing)\\
52 - This tiny wave came at us,\\
53 - I let it go.\\
54 - He screamed like a girl and fell off his board.\\
55 - I had to give him mouth-to-mouth,\\
56 - he swallowed a lot of water.\\
57 - He's going to be okay?\\
58 - I think so.\\
59 - He tried slipping me the tongue.\\
60 - Charlie, can you hear me? (coughing)\\
61 - Sha...\\
62 - What?\\
63 - Sha...\\
64 - I think he's trying to say shark."\\
65 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
66 - * Ah-ha * Men... *\\
67 - Want something to drink?\\
68 - Oh, yeah.\\
69 - Ugh.\\
70 - What is this?\\
71 - Water.\\
72 - Are you crazy? I almost drowned in that stuff.\\
73 - Where's my little hard body?\\
74 - He took off with that girl you brought home.\\
75 - Other than that, your plan worked like a charm.\\
76 - Fine. Go ahead and mock me.\\
77 - But I could have died out there.\\
78 - Well the sea is a harsh mistress.\\
79 - And... you're a moron.\\
80 - What? You said to mock you.\\
81 - It's no joke, Alan.\\
82 - Oh, come on.\\
83 - You tried to scam your way into a surf bunny's shorts\\
84 - and ended up French kissing a handsome young lifeguard.\\
85 - How is that not a joke?\\
86 - It's not a joke, because...\\
87 - Something happened out there while I was drowning.\\
88 - What, did your entire sordid, degenerate life\\
89 - flash before your eyes?\\
90 - I wish.\\
91 - No, no, no.\\
92 - It was...\\
93 - Oh, you're not going to believe me.\\
94 - Try me.\\
95 - I saw Dad.\\
96 - Oh, baloney.\\
97 - You know what?\\
98 - Just forget it.\\
99 - Oh, come on, it was probably just\\
100 - a hallucination caused by, you know,\\
101 - brain cells dying.\\
102 - No, I'm used to that.\\
103 - This was no hallucination.\\
104 - Dad was right there in the water with me.\\
105 - All right, all right, for the sake of argument\\
106 - let's assume that you saw\\
107 - the spirit of our dead father.\\
108 - What did he do, reach a hand out\\
109 - to guide you to the great beyond?\\
110 - Don't be ridiculous.\\
111 - He didn't have hands.\\
112 - It was just his head kind of floating there\\
113 - like the great, powerful Oz.\\
114 - Or one of the Pep Boys.\\
115 - Wow.\\
116 - Manny, Moe or Jack?\\
117 - Jack.\\
118 - And he spoke to me.\\
119 - Oh, oh, you were able to hear him\\
120 - underwater?\\
121 - How weird.\\
122 - Oh, that's the part that bumps you?\\
123 - I'm just saying that you were able to hear him\\
124 - because you were imagining it.\\
125 - It was in your head.\\
126 - No. Oh, no.\\
127 - In a million years my mind\\
128 - could not have made up what he said to me.\\
129 - What'd he say?\\
130 - (sighs)\\
131 - Something that made my blood run cold.\\
132 - What?\\
133 - Never mind.\\
134 - I probably heard him wrong.\\
135 - Charlie... Please don't make me say it.\\
136 - Come on, Charlie, I am your brother.\\
137 - Whatever it was, we'll deal with it together.\\
138 - He said...\\
139 - "Take care of your mother."\\
140 - Good luck with that.\\
141 - * Men. *\\
142 - Hey.\\
143 - Hey.\\
144 - Dad said you almost drowned today.\\
145 - Yep.\\
146 - Are you okay now?\\
147 - I'm fine.\\
148 - Can I ask you a question?\\
149 - Sure.\\
150 - It's about what happens when you die.\\
151 - Okay.\\
152 - Who gets your car?\\
153 - Go away.\\
154 - You're right. Not a good time to ask.\\
155 - So, what you doing?\\
156 - Thinking about Dad.\\
157 - Yeah, about that,\\
158 - I was wondering, when you saw him,\\
159 - assuming you saw him,\\
160 - did he... ask about me?\\
161 - No.\\
162 - He just said, "Take are of your mother."\\
163 - Huh.\\
164 - Didn't... didn't mention me at all?\\
165 - Nope.\\
166 - Typical.\\
167 - Oh, here we go.\\
168 - I'm just saying,\\
169 - the guy doesn't get in touch for 30 years--\\
170 - it wouldn't kill him to throw in a quick, "Hello, Alan."\\
171 - Dead or alive, that's just rude.\\
172 - Tell you what.\\
173 - Why don't you go fill up the tub,\\
174 - I'll hold your head under the water\\
175 - till the bubbles stop,\\
176 - and then you can tell him how offended you are.\\
177 - Oh, no. I have nothing to say to him now.\\
178 - How does he expect me to take care of her?\\
179 - I don't know.\\
180 - Why don't you try treating her like a human being?\\
181 - Nah, that can't be it.\\
182 - What if I put her in an assisted-living facility?\\
183 - That's ridiculous. She's a healthy woman.\\
184 - I'm not saying she wouldn't put up a fight.\\
185 - But hey, crumble up a few Xanax in her mimosa\\
186 - and we could probably coax her into a cave full of bats.\\
187 - I don't think that's what Dad meant.\\
188 - How do you know?\\
189 - Did he talk to you?\\
190 - No, he talked to me.\\
191 - Sure, rub my nose in it.\\
192 - How about this--\\
193 - when was the last time you called her\\
194 - just to see how she was doing?\\
195 - Uh... what's today, Sunday?\\
196 - Then never.\\
197 - Why don't you start with that?\\
198 - Okay. Fine.\\
199 - Remember her number?\\
200 - I've got it on speed dial.\\
201 - 6-6-6.\\
202 - Cute, huh?\\
203 - Hey, Mom, it's Charlie.\\
204 - Nothing's the matter.\\
205 - I just called to see how you're doing.\\
206 - No, I'm not drunk.\\
207 - I was just thinking about you,\\
208 - and I thought I'd call.\\
209 - I swear to God I'm not drunk.\\
210 - Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.\\
211 - You happy?\\
212 - So what's going on?\\
213 - I haven't talked to you in awhi...\\
214 - Well, I'm talking to you now.\\
215 - Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.\\
216 - Excuse me?\\
217 - Okay. Okay. Okay.\\
218 - So... everything okay?\\
219 - I'm taking her to lunch tomorrow.\\
220 - Voluntarily?\\
221 - Wow, you must have really had a spiritual experience out there.\\
222 - Let's face it, Alan,\\
223 - when Dad was alive, I was a rotten son.\\
224 - Oh, you sure were.\\
225 - You were horrible.\\
226 - Boy, I remember the time...\\
227 - The point is...\\
228 - maybe I've got a chance to make up for it now.\\
229 - He wants me to take care of Mom,\\
230 - then that's what we're going to do.\\
231 - Well, that-that's gr...\\
232 - Wait a minute, did you say "we"?\\
233 - I'm not going.\\
234 - Fine.\\
235 - Next time I see our father's floating head,\\
236 - I'm going to tell him you refused to help.\\
237 - (mocking tone): I'm going to tell him, I'm going to tell him.\\
238 - God, you're such a child.\\
239 - So you're coming? Yeah.\\
240 - I can't tell you what a treat it is\\
241 - to have lunch with my two favorite sons.\\
242 - You have others?\\
243 - It's an expression, Charlie.\\
244 - Although I do sponsor a little boy in Africa.\\
245 - No kidding?\\
246 - Oh, yes. Little Mobutu.\\
247 - He's in the middle of a civil war,\\
248 - and I still hear from him more than you.\\
249 - Hey, Alan, tell Mom what that little rascal Jake's been up to.\\
250 - He hasn't been up to anything.\\
251 - Okay.\\
252 - So...\\
253 - I think I'll go to the bathroom.\\
254 - Why?\\
255 - What do you mean why? I have to go.\\
256 - When was the last time you had a prostate exam?\\
257 - Feels like I'm having one now.\\
258 - I'm just expressing concern for your health.\\
259 - You don't have to get snippy.\\
260 - I'm not being snippy.\\
261 - Is it just me, or is he snippy?\\
262 - Try living with him.\\
263 - Excuse me.\\
264 - All right, what's going on?\\
265 - What makes you think something's going on?\\
266 - When one of my sons calls me for no reason\\
267 - and agrees to take me to lunch,\\
268 - something heinous is going on.\\
269 - Hey, I took you to lunch two weeks ago\\
270 - for no reason other than I love you.\\
271 - Oh, yes, the tacky little chain restaurant in the Valley.\\
272 - That fish shot out of me like there was a fire drill.\\
273 - The point is I love you.\\
274 - The point is I lost four pounds in two days.\\
275 - Well, you do look thinner.\\
276 - It's too late for flattery, darling.\\
277 - Now what is going on with your brother?\\
278 - I don't think he'd be very happy with me if I told you.\\
279 - Sweetheart, you're not his favorite person now.\\
280 - (sighs)\\
281 - Okay, here's the thing.\\
282 - Charlie almost drowned yesterday.\\
283 - Oh, dear Lord,\\
284 - I've told him over and over again\\
285 - two drinks max in the hot tub.\\
286 - No, he was surfing.\\
287 - In the hot tub?\\
288 - In the ocean.\\
289 - Start again.\\
290 - He was trying to impress some girl.\\
291 - Ah, oh, okay.\\
292 - Like the time he broke his nose\\
293 - playing tetherball.\\
294 - Exactly.\\
295 - Anyway, he was convinced he was near death\\
296 - and that he saw Dad.\\
297 - He saw your father?\\
298 - Wow.\\
299 - How'd he look?\\
300 - Uh, he was just kind of a floating head.\\
301 - Yeah, that's pretty much how I remember him.\\
302 - Fairly useless from the neck down.\\
303 - Anyway, Dad told Charlie to take care of you.\\
304 - Really?\\
305 - Anything else?\\
306 - Nope, that's it.\\
307 - Just for him to take care of you.\\
308 - It's like I might as well not even exist.\\
309 - Oh, Alan, you can't take that personally.\\
310 - First of all, Charlie was a planned baby.\\
311 - What was I?\\
312 - Well, dear, you were a pitcher of margaritas\\
313 - and a gas station condom.\\
314 - I had a nice solid stream of urine,\\
315 - thank you very much.\\
316 - What?\\
317 - My prostate is fine.\\
318 - What kind of table talk is that?\\
319 - You're the one that brought it up.\\
320 - It doesn't matter who brought it up.\\
321 - I don't want to hear about it when I'm eating.\\
322 - You know what?\\
323 - This lunch was a bad idea.\\
324 - No, don't say that, darling.\\
325 - It was a wonderful idea.\\
326 - If I'm being ungracious, I apologize.\\
327 - All right, let's call it "ungracious,"\\
328 - but we all know what we're thinking.\\
329 - I guess I'm just a little edgy because, well...\\
330 - No, never mind.\\
331 - What?\\
332 - Forget it. My problems are my problems.\\
333 - I don't expect you to take care of me.\\
334 - Mom, just for the sake of argument,\\
335 - let's say that I wanted to take care of you.\\
336 - What's going on?\\
337 - Nothing.\\
338 - I'm just having a little minor surgery tomorrow.\\
339 - What kind of surgery?\\
340 - It's a woman thing.\\
341 - Is there anything I can do?\\
342 - Just keep me in your prayers.\\
343 - No, no, no.\\
344 - I will drive you there\\
345 - and then take you back to my place so you can recuperate.\\
346 - Oh, sweetheart, that's very generous,\\
347 - but I don't want to be a burden.\\
348 - Mom, please, that ship has sailed.\\
349 - Well, then I accept.\\
350 - Thank you.\\
351 - Who buys condoms at a gas station?!\\
352 - * Men. *\\
353 - Watch your step here.\\
354 - Thank you, darling.\\
355 - What happened to your mouth?\\
356 - I just had a little procedure.\\
357 - What kind of procedure?\\
358 - They sucked some fat out of her ass and shot it into her lips.\\
359 - What did they do, use the whole ass?\\
360 - They're just a little swollen.\\
361 - In two days they'll be plump, luscious and ready for action.\\
362 - What boy doesn't like hearing that from his mother?\\
363 - Charlie, I need to sit down.\\
364 - Okay, got you covered.\\
365 - I thought you said it was a woman thing.\\
366 - You know any guys dumb enough to do this.\\
367 - Good Lord!\\
368 - What'd you do, fellate a beehive?\\
369 - Fellate?\\
370 - I read. I can conjugate.\\
371 - Man, the last time I saw a mouth like that,\\
372 - it was trying to eat Jacques Cousteau.\\
373 - * Men. *\\
374 - Here you go, Mom, nice bite-sized pieces.\\
375 - Thank you, darling.\\
376 - Dad said you got your butt in your lips.\\
377 - Just eat your dinner.\\
378 - Hang on.\\
379 - So if you burp now, it'd really be a fart, right?\\
380 - Eat.\\
381 - Charlie, my doughnut's too soft.\\
382 - So, Jake, has your mother succeeded\\
383 - in turning you against me yet?\\
384 - Mom.\\
385 - What, you don't think she talks?\\
386 - You don't think he listens?\\
387 - Trust me, Alan, even the mind of a dull child\\
388 - can be poisoned by a malicious parent.\\
389 - Can we just please change the subject?\\
390 - Although, I must say I prefer your mother\\
391 - to that postpubescent knucklehead\\
392 - your father replaced her with.\\
393 - Okay, okay, that's it.\\
394 - What? I changed the subject.\\
395 - Come on, Jake, We're going to the movies.\\
396 - On a school night?\\
397 - Why not? You're flunking anyway.\\
398 - Wait, wait, wait. You're just leaving me?\\
399 - You're taking care of Mom, remember?\\
400 - That's not fair?\\
401 - You got a complaint? Take it to the floating head.\\
402 - So how's work?\\
403 - Fine.\\
404 - You seeing anybody special?\\
405 - Nope.\\
406 - Charlie, did you ever stop to think\\
407 - that our relationship is strained\\
408 - because you won't let me in.\\
409 - You won't share.\\
410 - You know why I won't share with you, Mom?\\
411 - Because anything I say will be used against me.\\
412 - Oh, please.\\
413 - I have go to the bathroom? Maybe I have a prostate problem.\\
414 - I buy a new Mercedes,\\
415 - you call it a Nazi phallic symbol.\\
416 - I'm seeing someone new,\\
417 - you ask if I'm paying her by the hour or per shtup.\\
418 - Charlie, when I say those things,\\
419 - it's because I want to help you.\\
420 - You're my son.\\
421 - I want you to be the best you can be.\\
422 - I appreciate that, but you can stop worrying.\\
423 - I'm doing fine.\\
424 - I am the best I can be.\\
425 - Oh, darling, that just breaks my heart.\\
426 - * Men. *\\
427 - Why would he do this to me?\\
428 - "Take care of your mother."\\
429 - Not like she ever took care of him.\\
430 - She nagged him, humiliated him, emasculate him.\\
431 - The main reason he died so young is 'cause he wanted to.\\
432 - Charlie! My donut's soft again.\\
433 - Be right there.\\
434 - Why?\\
435 - Why do you want me to take care of her?\\
436 - Charlie!\\
437 - I'm coming!\\
438 - Come on. Talk to me.\\
439 - Give me a sign.\\
440 - ROSE (deep voice): Marry that cute girl down the beach.\\
441 - Rose.\\
442 - Yes, that's her name.\\
443 - You know what?\\
444 - You can tell me in person because I am this close\\
445 - to sticking my tongue in a light socket!\\
446 - ROSE (normal voice): Why don't you stick your tongue\\
447 - in my mouth instead?\\
448 - ROSE (deep voice): I mean, Rose's mouth.\\
449 - What are you watching?\\
450 - Some old gangster movie.\\
451 - (sighs)\\
452 - Any good?\\
453 - Not really.\\
454 - Just gives me a warm feeling\\
455 - to know that all those young beautiful actors are now dead.\\
456 - MAN (on TV): The dame knows too much.\\
457 - MAN 2: Want I should take care of her, boss?\\
458 - Yeah, take care of her,\\
459 - but make it look like an accident.\\
460 - Don't worry about a thing.\\
461 - I'll take care of her.\\
462 - Sorry.\\
463 - I misunderstood.\\
464 - What's that, dear?\\
465 - Nothing.\\
466 - * Men. *\\
467 - (knocking)\\
468 - Hi.\\
469 - Hello.\\
470 - I don't know if you remember me,\\
471 - but I'm the one who pulled you out of the ocean the other day.\\
472 - Oh, right, right, right. Thanks.\\
473 - It's okay, it's my job.\\
474 - Well, I'm-I'm glad you did it.\\
475 - Anyway, I was just checking in on you, see how you're doing.\\
476 - I'm doing fine.\\
477 - Good.\\
478 - So you want to walk down to the pier,\\
479 - maybe grab a cup of coffee?\\
480 - Gee, uh, I don't know.\\
481 - EVELYN: Charlie,\\
482 - it's time to change my butt dressing.\\
483 - Ah, what the hell. Let's go.
\subsection {Episode 04: A Pot Smoking Monkey}
1 - Our divorce does not have to be adversarial.\\
2 - Bet she won't know that word.\\
3 - No, not "ads for cereal."\\
4 - Told ya.\\
5 - Do you know?\\
6 - That wasn't the bet.\\
7 - Oh, come on.\\
8 - You're being very unfair.\\
9 - I love Chester as much as you do.\\
10 - Oh. Oh, really?\\
11 - Oh, well, then maybe you can explain to me\\
12 - why I'm the one who feeds Chester,\\
13 - gives Chester tick baths\\
14 - and cleans up when Chester piddles on the rug.\\
15 - When'd you change your name to Chester?\\
16 - And it's not just me. Jake loves that dog, too.\\
17 - No, I don't.\\
18 - He slobbers and he threw up in my shoe.\\
19 - I had a date like that once.\\
20 - You think it would have slowed me down, but no.\\
21 - All right, all right, can I at least talk to him?\\
22 - My father talks to dogs\\
23 - and they send me to a psychologist.\\
24 - Hello, Chester?\\
25 - It's Daddy!\\
26 - Who's a good boy?!\\
27 - You're a good boy!\\
28 - Yes, you are!\\
29 - Yes, you are! Yes...\\
30 - Kandi, I wasn't finished.\\
31 - Yeah, well, well, I have rights here.\\
32 - And, and I intend to pursue those rights\\
33 - with all the means at my disposal.\\
34 - Yeah, well, okay, okay. Good-bye.\\
35 - Alan? Yeah?\\
36 - (mocking): Who's a moron?\\
37 - You're a moron!\\
38 - Yes, you are! Yes, you are!\\
39 - Well, it may be funny to you,\\
40 - but that dog means a lot to me.\\
41 - This really about the dog\\
42 - or is it about Kandi?\\
43 - It's about the dog.\\
44 - I mean,\\
45 - we bought a condo, she's keeping it.\\
46 - We bought a car, she's keeping it.\\
47 - What do I get to keep?\\
48 - Certainly not your dignity.\\
49 - Okay, let's look at the big picture.\\
50 - You're a middle-aged guy who married\\
51 - a stupid woman half his age\\
52 - for no other reason than the sex was great.\\
53 - You with me so far?\\
54 - Yeah.\\
55 - Good. Then you ran out of money,\\
56 - she got bored and threw you out.\\
57 - What's your point?\\
58 - Why does everything need a point?\\
59 - Why can't I just make fun of you?\\
60 - I want my dog, Charlie.\\
61 - There'll be other dogs...\\
62 - not in my house.\\
63 - Just remember:\\
64 - the worst thing you can do is fight over who gets what.\\
65 - The trick is to give her everything.\\
66 - Everything? Whatever she wants\\
67 - because when all is said and done,\\
68 - you'll get the one thing that matters most,\\
69 - the thing you can't put a price on.\\
70 - My dignity.\\
71 - Oh, stop it.\\
72 - That ship has sailed.\\
73 - No, no, no.\\
74 - The thing you get is freedom;\\
75 - the opportunity to start over.\\
76 - Maybe a little sadder, but a whole lot wiser.\\
77 - And the next time you meet a woman--\\
78 - and trust me, you will--\\
79 - you'll have a real shot at true and lasting happiness.\\
80 - I want my dog.\\
81 - Well, good luck with that\\
82 - 'cause I was lying about the other stuff.\\
83 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
84 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
85 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
86 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
87 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
88 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
89 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
90 - You know, you get one week, and I get one week.\\
91 - It doesn't make any difference.\\
92 - Dog weeks and people weeks are the same thing.\\
93 - Hey, Dad, how come you don't give me an allowance?\\
94 - Because your mother gives you an allowance.\\
95 - Look, I am just trying to be fair here.\\
96 - Speaking of fair,\\
97 - it doesn't seem fair that Mom has to pay me and you don't.\\
98 - Hang on, Kandi.\\
99 - Let me explain something to you.\\
100 - Every cent your mother has comes from me.\\
101 - So when she gives you allowance,\\
102 - it's really me giving you an allowance.\\
103 - I don't need to know how it works,\\
104 - I just need more money.\\
105 - Take a number.\\
106 - Sorry, go ahead.\\
107 - Six.\\
108 - Morning.\\
109 - Morning.\\
110 - Look, if Chester is going to live anywhere full-time,\\
111 - I don't see why it shouldn't be here.\\
112 - I do. I see why.\\
113 - When he split with your mother,\\
114 - did they fight like this over your custody?\\
115 - They still do. "You take him."\\
116 - "No, you take him."\\
117 - ALAN: Okay. Okay, okay, fine.\\
118 - You want this to get ugly?\\
119 - You want to play hardball?\\
120 - I will, I will play hardball.\\
121 - How come you don't give me an allowance?\\
122 - What, are you drunk?\\
123 - Yeah, well, I am going to get a lawyer.\\
124 - I-I am going to take you to court.\\
125 - Yeah, and then we'll just see who gets Chester.\\
126 - Yeah! Yeah, well, well, have your lawyer call my lawyer!\\
127 - (phone slams)\\
128 - You know a lawyer?\\
129 - * Men.\\
130 - Oh.\\
131 - Hi.\\
132 - What do you want, Alan?\\
133 - Oh, okay, right to it, huh?\\
134 - Uh, well, as you know, Kandi and I are splitting up.\\
135 - Yeah, quelle surprise.\\
136 - Merci.\\
137 - Anyhoo, I'm going to need a good lawyer\\
138 - and I thought, you know,\\
139 - who better than the rabid jackal who ripped my lungs out\\
140 - in my first divorce?\\
141 - You want my lawyer?\\
142 - Well, I certainly don't want mine.\\
143 - Gee, Alan, I'm sorry, but I can't give him to you.\\
144 - Why not?\\
145 - Because I already gave him to Kandi.\\
146 - You're joking, right?\\
147 - I'm smiling, but I'm not joking.\\
148 - Why would you do that?\\
149 - I don't know-- kicks.\\
150 - Oh, Judith, when did you start hating me so much?\\
151 - Well, let's see, I disliked you when we were married,\\
152 - I resented you when we divorced,\\
153 - but I don't think I hated you\\
154 - until you started having sex\\
155 - with that gorgeous 22-year-old dumbbell.\\
156 - Okay, well, thanks for clearing that up.\\
157 - Bye-bye.\\
158 - * Men.\\
159 - Look, if you really want to make some extra cash,\\
160 - I'm sure we can find some household chores for you to do.\\
161 - Oh, yeah, there's big money in that.\\
162 - What kind of chores?\\
163 - Well, let's see.\\
164 - You can take out the garbage,\\
165 - sweep up the garage, wash my car.\\
166 - No, none of those sound good.\\
167 - Tell you what.\\
168 - I'll give you ten bucks\\
169 - if you can eat this entire tub of ice cream\\
170 - in less than 20 minutes.\\
171 - Okay.\\
172 - Charlie, that will shoot out of him\\
173 - like Ben and Jerry on rocket skates.\\
174 - Here, eat these instead.\\
175 - By the time they get through you,\\
176 - it'll be your mom's problem.\\
177 - All of them in 20 minutes, right?\\
178 - Yep.\\
179 - Then can I have the ice cream?\\
180 - Uh-oh.\\
181 - * Men.\\
182 - Alan, you should have called.\\
183 - I didn't feel like calling. I want to see my dog.\\
184 - Well, maybe he doesn't want to see you.\\
185 - Why don't we let him decide?\\
186 - No, he's been through enough.\\
187 - Oh, really? Did he tell you that?\\
188 - How could he tell me anything?\\
189 - You know as well as I do\\
190 - that he keeps everything bottled up.\\
191 - Damn it, Kandi, I want to see my...\\
192 - Don't you yell at me.\\
193 - If you have anything to say\\
194 - you can say it to my lawyer.\\
195 - Maybe I will.\\
196 - Honey, Alan has something he wants to say to you.\\
197 - Hey.\\
198 - What's up?\\
199 - It's you...\\
200 - the jackal.\\
201 - Oh, that hurts.\\
202 - Listen, as long as you're here,\\
203 - is your billing address still the same?\\
204 - Uh-huh.\\
205 - Great. Well, I guess I'll see you in court.\\
206 - Oh, and don't worry.\\
207 - I'm not going to bill you for this consultation.\\
208 - There's nothing legal going on here.\\
209 - * Men.\\
210 - CHARLIE: Unfreaking-believable.\\
211 - It's like watching a pot-smoking monkey.\\
212 - Ten dollars, please.\\
213 - Serves me right, betting against a kid\\
214 - who can eat a Happy Meal, toys and all.\\
215 - Thank you.\\
216 - What are you doing?\\
217 - You tell me always do my own count.\\
218 - Yeah, but you can trust me.\\
219 - ...seven, eight...\\
220 - nine?\\
221 - It was an honest mistake.\\
222 - I'm sure.\\
223 - So what are you going to do with your winnings?\\
224 - It's a secret.\\
225 - So it's a girl.\\
226 - How'd you know?\\
227 - I didn't.\\
228 - Then it isn't.\\
229 - Come on. Tell me about her.\\
230 - Maybe I can help.\\
231 - I don't think so.\\
232 - Are you kidding me?\\
233 - Who knows more about girls than your Uncle Charlie?\\
234 - Warren Beatty, Bill Clinton, Rosie O'Donnell.\\
235 - Why should I talk to you?\\
236 - You've messed up every relationship\\
237 - you've ever been in.\\
238 - Well, yeah, but...\\
239 - So you're not exactly a good example.\\
240 - I get it. I mean, if I were old enough to have one-night stands...\\
241 - All right, all right, you've made your point.\\
242 - So don't talk to me.\\
243 - I won't. Okay. Okay.\\
244 - Good.\\
245 - Will you drive me to the mall?\\
246 - Why?\\
247 - It's private.\\
248 - So's my car.\\
249 - All right, I want to buy a present.\\
250 - For?\\
251 - It's a secret.\\
252 - I'll throw in another ten.\\
253 - Wendy Cho.\\
254 - Aha! A present for Wendy Cho.\\
255 - Now, is this an offering to grease the wheels\\
256 - or a parting gift for the wheels having already been greased?\\
257 - Grease the wheels?\\
258 - See, that's why I don't talk to you about this stuff.\\
259 - Well, he may be as dull as a butter knife,\\
260 - but you got to admit he's a good judge of character.\\
261 - Are you sure\\
262 - it doesn't have anything to do with sex?\\
263 - Positive.\\
264 - Huh. Sure sounds like it.\\
265 - "Subpoenas."\\
266 - Hang in there, Chester.\\
267 - Daddy's coming.\\
268 - Oh, please, please, please, please, please.\\
269 - Yes! She didn't change the lock.\\
270 - (alarm blaring)\\
271 - But that's new.\\
272 - Skull earrings?\\
273 - Yeah, they're silver and they got ruby eyes.\\
274 - Okay, first of all, for $11.95...\\
275 - those aren't rubies.\\
276 - You don't know that.\\
277 - Oh, but I do.\\
278 - And second, girls like Wendy Cho\\
279 - don't wear skull earrings.\\
280 - How do you know?\\
281 - She gets straight A's, right?\\
282 - She plays violin?\\
283 - She's also the captain of the math team.\\
284 - Exactly. So you see my point.\\
285 - Oh. Okay.\\
286 - How 'bout that skull belt buckle?\\
287 - No skulls.\\
288 - Just out of curiosity,\\
289 - does this Wendy Cho hate her parents?\\
290 - I don't think so. Why?\\
291 - Just trying to get a handle on the relationship.\\
292 - She says she likes me 'cause I'm unpretentious.\\
293 - You know what that means?\\
294 - It means she likes me.\\
295 - Yeah. Okay.\\
296 - So what do you want this gift to say?\\
297 - Uh... "Happy birthday"?\\
298 - A birthday card says "Happy birthday."\\
299 - What are you trying to tell her by giving her jewelry?\\
300 - I don't know. I guess... that I love her.\\
301 - What?\\
302 - Nothing. That's terrific.\\
303 - Hey, just because you don't love any girl\\
304 - doesn't mean I shouldn't.\\
305 - Excuse me, but I have loved many girls\\
306 - and many girls have loved me.\\
307 - That's not love, it's just sex.\\
308 - Um, I'm sorry, I'm not following you.\\
309 - If you died tomorrow, how many of those girls\\
310 - would come to your funeral?\\
311 - A lot of them.\\
312 - Granted, a few might show up\\
313 - just to make sure I'm really dead.\\
314 - But I feel confident that the overall tone of the event\\
315 - would be one of sadness.\\
316 - If you say so.\\
317 - Yeah. I say so.\\
318 - And let's get out of here.\\
319 - I haven't picked out a gift yet.\\
320 - Then get her the stupid skull earrings.\\
321 - But you said she wouldn't like 'em.\\
322 - What do I know? Nobody loves me.\\
323 - Nobody's coming to my funeral.\\
324 - Whoa. Where'd that come from?\\
325 - Here. What about this gold heart necklace?\\
326 - It's kinda expensive.\\
327 - If you want the best, Jake, you gotta pay for it.\\
328 - Yeah, but $39?\\
329 - I mean, I love her and everything...\\
330 - Tell you what, if it means we can get out of here quicker,\\
331 - I'll front you the difference. I don't know.\\
332 - What do you mean you don't know? I'm offering you a great deal.\\
333 - Yeah, but you always say,\\
334 - "If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is."\\
335 - All right, how 'bout if I pay for the whole thing?\\
336 - That sounds even better, so no.\\
337 - Come on, Brainiac.\\
338 - What do I have to do for you?\\
339 - Just promise to be sad at my funeral.\\
340 - Do I have to cry?\\
341 - No.\\
342 - Will there be food?\\
343 - Yes.\\
344 - Can I bring a date?\\
345 - You're just screwing with me now, right?\\
346 - How does it feel?\\
347 - * Men.\\
348 - Still early. Want to go shoot some hoops?\\
349 - Nah. I'm gonna go\\
350 - call Wendy Cho.\\
351 - Hey.\\
352 - Bros before Chos.\\
353 - "Thanks for the ride to the mall, Uncle Charlie."\\
354 - "Thanks for buying me the necklace, Charlie."\\
355 - "Thanks for not slugging me when I started mouthing off\\
356 - about your funeral, Uncle Charlie."\\
357 - (sighs)\\
358 - (gasps)\\
359 - Chessie.\\
360 - Whoa, whoa, calm down.\\
361 - Calm down. Easy, boy.\\
362 - Charlie, what'd you do to him?\\
363 - What did I do to him?\\
364 - I practically crapped my pants is what I did to him.\\
365 - What the hell is that?\\
366 - This is Chester. Isn't he cute?\\
367 - Yes, you are. Yes, you are.\\
368 - He's not staying here, Alan.\\
369 - Well, with all due respect, that's what you said about me.\\
370 - It's because no kennel in town would take you.\\
371 - Oh, come on, look at him.\\
372 - How can you not love this face?\\
373 - Easy. I know where he puts it.\\
374 - Now take him back to Kandi's.\\
375 - I can't.\\
376 - Why not?\\
377 - It's kinda complicated.\\
378 - Then simplify it.\\
379 - Okay, well, um...\\
380 - I stole him.\\
381 - Oh, Alan.\\
382 - I may think with my penis, but at least I think.\\
383 - Don't worry. You won't have to do anything.\\
384 - I'll feed him, I'll walk him.\\
385 - Walk him?\\
386 - You can hitch a wagon to him and settle the West.\\
387 - No dogs in my house.\\
388 - Especially stolen dogs who are big enough\\
389 - to make me their bitch.\\
390 - BERTA: Whoa!\\
391 - What the hell is that?\\
392 - That... is leaving.\\
393 - Oh, Charlie, please.\\
394 - In my entire life, Chester is the only living thing\\
395 - I ever slept with that didn't sue me for alimony.\\
396 - Alan, how long do you think you're gonna get away with this?\\
397 - I was very careful. I left the door open\\
398 - so that when Kandi comes home, she'll think\\
399 - she left it open and that Chester ran away.\\
400 - She'll never dream of looking for him here.\\
401 - (doorbell ringing)\\
402 - Probably.\\
403 - Just in case-- hide Chester.\\
404 - How am I supposed to hide him?\\
405 - Sit under him with a pail and pretend he's a cow.\\
406 - (doorbell rings)\\
407 - Coming!\\
408 - (mutters)\\
409 - Come on, Bullwinkle.\\
410 - Yeah... Yeah...\\
411 - Alan Harper?\\
412 - Yes.\\
413 - Yes, how can I help you?\\
414 - We're investigating a stolen dog report.\\
415 - A-A dog?\\
416 - Your ex-wife's dog?\\
417 - Chester? Somebody stole Chester?\\
418 - She seems to think you might know his whereabouts.\\
419 - Oh, gosh, uh...\\
420 - I'm sorry, I have no idea...\\
421 - Uh, oh, although...\\
422 - you know what could have happened?\\
423 - Um... she, she could have left the, the door open.\\
424 - She's absent-minded.\\
425 - Uh, and the dog got away.\\
426 - (dog barking)\\
427 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\\
428 - * Men.\\
429 - ANNOUNCER: All right, 21-6,\\
430 - the Trojans lead the Aztecs.\\
431 - They'll have the ball when play resumes.\\
432 - Hey.\\
433 - Right now, Jim Watson's on the sidelines.\\
434 - Oh. Look who's finally off the phone.\\
435 - Yeah.\\
436 - So when are you gonna give Wendy Cho the necklace?\\
437 - I'm not.\\
438 - What happened?\\
439 - You chicken out?\\
440 - No.\\
441 - I don't believe it.\\
442 - You drag my ass all the way down to the mall.\\
443 - I pony up 40 bucks for the necklace\\
444 - and you chicken out.\\
445 - She just dumped me, you old turd.\\
446 - Oh. You coulda told me that before I started being a turd.\\
447 - I'm only 12.\\
448 - I need a time machine.\\
449 - Yeah, dude, I am really sorry.\\
450 - What happened?\\
451 - with mixed relationships.\\
452 - What? Chinese and Caucasian?\\
453 - Gifted and remedial.\\
454 - Oh...\\
455 - Yeah, well, I'm done with relationships.\\
456 - From now on, I'm gonna be like you.\\
457 - Why would you want to be like me?\\
458 - 'Cause you never fall in love with anybody,\\
459 - so you never get hurt.\\
460 - Okay.\\
461 - Listen to me.\\
462 - Being hurt sucks,\\
463 - but love is the most beautiful and noble of human emotions.\\
464 - It's what gives a man hope.\\
465 - It's what gives his life meaning.\\
466 - Don't turn your back on love, Jake.\\
467 - I did, and I regret it every day.\\
468 - Really?\\
469 - May God strike me down if I'm lying.\\
470 - (mouthing)\\
471 - All right, game's over.\\
472 - Let's go.\\
473 - Where are we going?\\
474 - Might as well bail your dad out of jail.\\
475 - Can we get something to eat first?\\
476 - Sure, why not?\\
477 - * Men.\\
478 - come back from Mexico?\\
479 - Three more days.\\
480 - (sniffing)\\
481 - Oh, God, what are you feeding that dog?\\
482 - It's not the dog.\\
483 - Smells a little like... banana bread.\\
484 - * Men.\\
485 - (dog barks)
\subsection {Episode 05: A Live Woman of Proven Fertility}
1 - you want to go out and grab some dinner?\\
2 - I can't go out to dinner, Charlie.\\
3 - Why not? You got a date?\\
4 - He said, knowing the answer,\\
5 - but asking anyway, just to be polite.\\
6 - No, I don't have a date, he replied, all the while thinking,\\
7 - "Bite me, you booze-addled buffoon."\\
8 - So why can't you go?\\
9 - Are you kidding?\\
10 - I'm paying alimony to two women.\\
11 - I don't have money for luxuries like eating out.\\
12 - Or eating in, really.\\
13 - I'm trying to learn to chew my own cud.\\
14 - It's all right, I'll treat.\\
15 - No, no, no, you've done too much for me already.\\
16 - Yeah, but it's not like I'm keeping a tab... $26,382.\\
17 - To date.\\
18 - Exactly, so I need to start carrying my own weight,\\
19 - which is actually getting easier now that I'm wasting away.\\
20 - Oh, stop feeling sorry for yourself.\\
21 - I'm not feeling sorry for myself.\\
22 - I'll find something here to eat.\\
23 - Maybe some scrambled eggs and a Popsicle.\\
24 - Fine. See ya later.\\
25 - (sighs)\\
26 - All right, I'm only going to ask you one more time.\\
27 - Would you like to have dinner with me?\\
28 - That depends. Where are we going?\\
29 - Oh, for God's sake!\\
30 - What, what, I don't even get a vote?\\
31 - No, you don't get a vote. You get a free meal.\\
32 - Well, if I was one of your dates, you'd ask where I wanted to go.\\
33 - You're right.\\
34 - (sexy voice): So where to do you want to go, baby?\\
35 - That's uh, that's very funny.\\
36 - Oh, no, no, let's get something hot in you\\
37 - and then get something hot in you.\\
38 - Knock it off.\\
39 - Gee, you smell good.\\
40 - You know what, you know what? Okay, okay.\\
41 - I'll just stay here and have a Popsicle.\\
42 - Oh, you'll be getting a Popsicle.\\
43 - Fine, fine, okay.\\
44 - You pick the restaurant.\\
45 - Thank you. How about sushi?\\
46 - Ew, not a big fan.\\
47 - (doorbell ringing)\\
48 - Oh, that's Judith.\\
49 - Keep thinking.\\
50 - Jake, your mother's here.\\
51 - Hey, that Popsicle almost...\\
52 - Hello.\\
53 - Hi. Yeah, he'll be right out.\\
54 - Do me a favor and take 'em both.\\
55 - Hey, Mom.\\
56 - Hey, honey, would you wait in the car, please?\\
57 - Who's in trouble-- me or Dad?\\
58 - No one's in trouble.\\
59 - It's you.\\
60 - Judith, if you're going to chew my ass off,\\
61 - just know, I'm planning on having it\\
62 - for breakfast tomorrow.\\
63 - No, you didn't do anything, Alan.\\
64 - I just, um...\\
65 - I wanted to let you know that, uh...\\
66 - Boy, this is awkward.\\
67 - You remember that I was dating Jake's pediatrician?\\
68 - Yeah, yeah, Melnick. What about him?\\
69 - Well, we started seeing each other again,\\
70 - and it's gotten serious.\\
71 - Oh. How serious?\\
72 - He asked me to marry him, and I said yes.\\
73 - Oh. Wow.\\
74 - I... I don't know what to say.\\
75 - Um, I guess congratulations.\\
76 - Thank you.\\
77 - Just wanted to let you know before we told Jake.\\
78 - Sure, sure, I appreciate it.\\
79 - It's kind of weird, isn't it?\\
80 - I mean, we spent so many years together.\\
81 - It's hard for me to think of you married to somebody else.\\
82 - Yeah.\\
83 - Still, I wish you the best, though.\\
84 - Oh, I know you do.\\
85 - Thank you.\\
86 - Well, bye.\\
87 - Bye.\\
88 - Five, six, seven, eight...\\
89 - * No more alimony, no more alimony *\\
90 - * No more alimony, no more alimony... *\\
91 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
92 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
93 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
94 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
95 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
96 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
97 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
98 - You mean besides eating it with you?\\
99 - It's all fleshy and flappy and wet.\\
100 - Feels unnatural against my tongue.\\
101 - Al... What?\\
102 - I think I know why your marriages didn't work out.\\
103 - Oh, stop it.\\
104 - Now, speaking of marriages,\\
105 - the next time we go out to dinner,\\
106 - it'll be on me,\\
107 - because with Judith getting married again...\\
108 - I'll have...\\
109 - (monotone): Five, six, seven, eight...\\
110 - * No more alimony, No more alimony *\\
111 - * No more alimo...\\
112 - Hey, Dad.\\
113 - What are you doing here?\\
114 - And how'd you get in?\\
115 - Rose let me in.\\
116 - Hey, guys.\\
117 - How was dinner?\\
118 - Forget dinner.\\
119 - What are you doing here?\\
120 - Keeping Jake company.\\
121 - But if you let him in, you had to have been here before him.\\
122 - Well, yeah.\\
123 - But if Jake hadn't shown up,\\
124 - I'd be gone by now, and you'd never know I was here.\\
125 - So what, you just waltz in and make yourself at home\\
126 - whenever I'm out?\\
127 - That's not true.\\
128 - Sometimes you're upstairs asleep.\\
129 - Wait a minute.\\
130 - Let's go back here.\\
131 - Jake, why aren't you at your mother's?\\
132 - I ran away.\\
133 - Sometimes you're in the shower.\\
134 - Rose, please.\\
135 - Why did you run away?\\
136 - Because I hate it there.\\
137 - Is this about the upcoming nuptials?\\
138 - It has nothing to do with puberty, Dad.\\
139 - It's about Mom getting married.\\
140 - I thought you liked Dr. Melnick.\\
141 - That was when they were just dating.\\
142 - Now he thinks he can tell me what to do.\\
143 - He's not my father.\\
144 - You don't do what I tell you to do.\\
145 - Yeah, but Mom doesn't care about that.\\
146 - Alan, Alan, can I just interrupt for one sec?\\
147 - How do you keep getting in?\\
148 - I've changed the locks three times.\\
149 - Yes, but you didn't change the locksmith.\\
150 - I could recommend somebody.\\
151 - Good night, Rose.\\
152 - I replace everything I eat.\\
153 - Good night, Rose.\\
154 - You know how I do it?\\
155 - I keep an exact duplicate fridge at my house.\\
156 - Good night, Rose.\\
157 - By the way, we're out of Popsicles.\\
158 - All right, I'm going to call your mother.\\
159 - She's probably worried sick.\\
160 - She's probably in the hot tub with Dr. Melnick.\\
161 - How'd you get here?\\
162 - Did you steal a car or something?\\
163 - How can I steal a car? I'm 12.\\
164 - Oh, kids these days.\\
165 - No imagination.\\
166 - I took the bus.\\
167 - In L.A.? At night?\\
168 - You'd have been safer stealing a car.\\
169 - So what's your plan? Where are you headed?\\
170 - I'm going to stay here.\\
171 - (chuckling): Oh, you can't stay here.\\
172 - Why not?\\
173 - Because you're running away.\\
174 - "Away," according to the dictionary,\\
175 - means "not here."\\
176 - It's usually preceded\\
177 - by the words, "far, far,"\\
178 - or in your case, "go."\\
179 - Oh, come on, why can't I live with you guys?\\
180 - Oh, Jake, do you have any idea how much I have\\
181 - to clean up my act when you're here on weekends?\\
182 - What are you talking about?\\
183 - I see you drink, gamble, you have strange girls sleep over.\\
184 - Uh-huh, drop in unannounced on a Wednesday,\\
185 - and you'll be scarred for life.\\
186 - Well, I hope you're proud of yourself-- your mother's crying.\\
187 - Good.\\
188 - Hey!\\
189 - Don't be mean to your mother.\\
190 - You're mean to your mother.\\
191 - My mother can take it.\\
192 - She actually feeds on it.\\
193 - Anyway, she wanted me to tell you\\
194 - that she loves you more than anything\\
195 - and that she and Dr. Melnick aren't going to get married\\
196 - until you've had time to adjust to the idea.\\
197 - Well, then they'll never get married,\\
198 - 'cause I'm never going to adjust to it.\\
199 - Five, six, seven...\\
200 - Shut up.\\
201 - * Men...\\
202 - You know, I am a little surprised at you.\\
203 - I would think you would want your mom to be happy.\\
204 - Hey, she can be happy all she wants.\\
205 - I just don't need some jerk pretending he's my dad.\\
206 - Oh, why not?\\
207 - 'Cause I already have a dad.\\
208 - And he's already a jerk.\\
209 - All right, buddy.\\
210 - I'm going to have to tell you something pretty heavy.\\
211 - But I think it's something\\
212 - that you're old enough to understand.\\
213 - You can do better than me.\\
214 - Way better.\\
215 - Did you know that I'm not even a real doctor,\\
216 - but Dr. Melnick is.\\
217 - So what?\\
218 - "So what"? Are you kidding?\\
219 - He makes more money than I do.\\
220 - He can buy you better presents than I can.\\
221 - And don't underestimate the value\\
222 - of having a prescription pad lying around the house.\\
223 - Charlie.\\
224 - You know, if someone gets sick.\\
225 - Or bored.\\
226 - But I only need one dad.\\
227 - And you'll only have one dad,\\
228 - but there's nothing that says\\
229 - you can't call him "Dad" and me "Alan."\\
230 - We'll still know who's who.\\
231 - I'm getting a little misty.\\
232 - Forget it, I'm never going to like him.\\
233 - May I suggest you try a more...\\
234 - shall we say, practical approach?\\
235 - Jake, how much does your mom give you for allowance?\\
236 - Ten dollars a week.\\
237 - Okay...\\
238 - Uh, I'm going to write down some figures here,\\
239 - and you tell me to stop when you see a number\\
240 - that makes you feel a little warmer toward Dr. Melnick.\\
241 - * Men...\\
242 - I was so worried about you.\\
243 - Don't you ever do that again.\\
244 - Thanks for bringing him back.\\
245 - No problem.\\
246 - Jake, isn't there something you want to say?\\
247 - Yeah.\\
248 - I love you, Dr. Melnick.\\
249 - * Men...\\
250 - You've got school in the morning.\\
251 - Hang on.\\
252 - Night, Dad.\\
253 - See ya, Alan.\\
254 - Night, buddy.\\
255 - (chuckling): Boy, he's really warming up to you.\\
256 - Yeah. Listen.\\
257 - Have you and Judith ever discussed putting Jake\\
258 - on any sort of medication?\\
259 - Why? What do you got?\\
260 - No, no, we haven't.\\
261 - Why?\\
262 - Well, I mean, one minute he hates me,\\
263 - the next minute he loves me,\\
264 - and those kinds of mood swings just aren't normal.\\
265 - Oh, no, no, no, don't worry about that.\\
266 - That's not an emotional problem.\\
267 - That's, uh, it's more like, um, uh, kind of...\\
268 - Charlie?\\
269 - We paid him to like you.\\
270 - You what?\\
271 - And it cost less than you might think.\\
272 - But that's a good thing.\\
273 - A bribable child is a controllable child.\\
274 - Plus, he's not too bright so you can lie to him all you want.\\
275 - Charlie. Oh, come on.\\
276 - Until he was ten,\\
277 - I had him convinced that swizzle sticks were money.\\
278 - Hey, hey, uh, speaking of swizzle sticks,\\
279 - have you guys considered eloping to Vegas?\\
280 - Hmm. No, we haven't...\\
281 - Now, I know what you're thinking-- tacky, tacky,\\
282 - but actually it isn't.\\
283 - It's classy and very romantic.\\
284 - Yeah, some of the hotel rooms have those big mirrored walls.\\
285 - It's like watching your ass bob up and down in IMAX.\\
286 - Huh.... I think actually\\
287 - we're going to put things on hold for a while.\\
288 - Why? You love Judith, don't you?\\
289 - Of course; she's a great woman.\\
290 - How's the sex?\\
291 - That's a little personal, isn't it?\\
292 - Hey, I didn't ask which way you point her.\\
293 - I just want to make sure you two kids are compatible.\\
294 - Oh. Well, there's no problem in that area.\\
295 - See, Alan? It was you.\\
296 - That's me,\\
297 - the original one-pump chump.\\
298 - So I hear.\\
299 - The thing is, I'm just not sure I'm ready to be a stepfather.\\
300 - Oh, oh, sure you are.\\
301 - You'll be terrific, right, Charlie?\\
302 - Trust us, as long as there's food in the fridge\\
303 - and money in your wallet, you'll own the little peckerhead.\\
304 - Poor baby was exhausted.\\
305 - He fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.\\
306 - Another plus: sound sleeper.\\
307 - Yeah, nothing wakes that kid up.\\
308 - And I've had some real screamers at my place.\\
309 - It's getting late; I'd like to go to bed.\\
310 - Why don't you do that.\\
311 - Listen, fatherhood is no big deal.\\
312 - Truth is, with the Internet and everything,\\
313 - they practically raise themselves.\\
314 - Alan.\\
315 - You go ahead, honey, I'll be in in a second.\\
316 - I don't know, I...\\
317 - I just think I need some time to get used to the idea.\\
318 - No, no, no, don't think about it.\\
319 - Parenthood is like skydiving.\\
320 - You just got to jump out of the ol' plane.\\
321 - And get sucked into the ol' propeller.\\
322 - A propeller of love.\\
323 - Hey, hey, hey, listen.\\
324 - Why don't we go out and talk about this\\
325 - over a couple of beers?\\
326 - Oh, well, thanks.\\
327 - I really enjoy spending time with you fellows,\\
328 - but I don't really drink.\\
329 - That's okay, neither do I.\\
330 - Well, okay, sure.\\
331 - I'll just tell Judith I'm leaving.\\
332 - No, that's okay, I'll tell her.\\
333 - Judith, we're leaving!\\
334 - JUDITH: Good! Let's go.\\
335 - * Men...\\
336 - My first wife and I tried to have kids,\\
337 - but it just didn't happen.\\
338 - And then when she got sick and passed away,\\
339 - I didn't think I'd ever have a family.\\
340 - Oh, oh, that's so sad.\\
341 - Yeah.\\
342 - Who was shooting blanks, you or her?\\
343 - Charlie, that doesn't matter.\\
344 - What matters is he's starting fresh with Judith.\\
345 - A live woman of proven fertility.\\
346 - What good does that do if he's packing a starter's pistol?\\
347 - I'm fine.\\
348 - You hear that? He's fine.\\
349 - Jake can have a little brother.\\
350 - That would be a blessing from heaven, wouldn't it?\\
351 - Oh, I don't know if I want more kids.\\
352 - Then wear a condom.\\
353 - Besides, Jake's used to being an only child.\\
354 - If there was a new one, he'd probably eat it by mistake.\\
355 - So, Herb, you haven't touched your beer.\\
356 - Oh, well, like I said, I'm not much of a drinker.\\
357 - Then we need a drinking game.\\
358 - How about this:\\
359 - each time Alan shoots me a dirty look, we all take a drink.\\
360 - Oop! Here we go.\\
361 - * Men...\\
362 - You guys are great guys.\\
363 - I love you guys.\\
364 - You know why? 'Cause you're great.\\
365 - You know, Herb, I wish more women\\
366 - held their liquor the way you do.\\
367 - Thank you.\\
368 - I would like to propose a toast.\\
369 - To Jake.\\
370 - Ah, Jake's great.\\
371 - And to Judith.\\
372 - Absolutely. Judith's great, too.\\
373 - And to your upcoming marriage.\\
374 - Eh, sure. What the hell.\\
375 - You know what I never had?\\
376 - A second beer?\\
377 - No, no, a bachelor party.\\
378 - Me, neither, thanks to my brother.\\
379 - Oop. Bottoms up.\\
380 - Mm. Hey.\\
381 - Why don't we make this your bachelor party?\\
382 - You know, one last big blowout with your friends before you get married.\\
383 - But my friends aren't here.\\
384 - What about us? We're your friends.\\
385 - We wish you well, right, Charlie?\\
386 - Well.\\
387 - Oh, come on, what do you say?\\
388 - I don't know...\\
389 - I mean, if this is a bachelor party...\\
390 - wouldn't there be a couple of strippers?\\
391 - Charlie?\\
392 - I'm on it.\\
393 - * Men...\\
394 - (rock music playing)\\
395 - He's going to make a great stepdad for Jake.\\
396 - Yeah, whatever.\\
397 - And with the alimony I save, I can go out to eat every night...\\
398 - in restaurants.\\
399 - And I'm not talking early bird special.\\
400 - I can eat when it's dark out, with people my own age.\\
401 - Hey, does your cell phone have video?\\
402 - Yeah, why?\\
403 - Observe.\\
404 - What are you doing?\\
405 - Just in case he decides to back out of the wedding.\\
406 - That's blackmail. So?\\
407 - I like it.\\
408 - Hey, Herb!\\
409 - Attaboy.\\
410 - (softly): You dumb bastard.\\
411 - (phone rings)\\
412 - Uh-oh. It's Judith.\\
413 - Why is she calling me at this hour?\\
414 - Hello?\\
415 - Of course it's me-- who were you expecting?\\
416 - Oh, my God, this is Herb's phone.\\
417 - Um, uh, Herb is in the bathroom.\\
418 - Yeah, yeah, we were just having a couple of beers\\
419 - and getting to know each other.\\
420 - Well, with all due respect, Judith,\\
421 - before we got married, I didn't drink, either.\\
422 - Hey, hey. There is no call for that kind of language.\\
423 - What? I'm sorry, I-I can't hear you.\\
424 - Yeah, I-I think this phone\\
425 - is ...unning out of ...atteries.\\
426 - I ...aid this ...one is ...unning out of ...atteries.\\
427 - ...ood-bye, ...udith.\\
428 - Think she bought it?\\
429 - If she did, she's ...upider than ...ou.\\
430 - (softly): Excuse me, fellas.\\
431 - (slurring): Can either of you cash a check for me?\\
432 - Why?\\
433 - I'd like to tip the ladies.\\
434 - No, no, forget the tip.\\
435 - We've got to get you home. (scoffs)\\
436 - Why would I go home when for an extra 300 bucks,\\
437 - I can go all around the world?\\
438 - He's got a point, Alan.\\
439 - Herb, listen to me.\\
440 - Your fianc  e is worried about you.\\
441 - Oh, right.\\
442 - Golly, she's gonna be pretty P.O.'d.\\
443 - It's okay. She doesn't need to know.\\
444 - That's right. She doesn't need to know.\\
445 - Can I borrow $300?\\
446 - ALAN: What are you doing?\\
447 - Call it a wedding gift.\\
448 - Are you crazy? I've got to get him home.\\
449 - So take him home. What are you going to do?\\
450 - I'm thinking maybe I'll go around the world.\\
451 - God knows I've racked up enough frequent-flyer miles.\\
452 - (snoring)\\
453 - Herb?\\
454 - Herb?!\\
455 - Herb?\\
456 - (sighs) Charlie, you're going to have\\
457 - to help me take him home...\\
458 - Charlie?\\
459 - * Men...\\
460 - You have a key?\\
461 - No I don't have a key.\\
462 - Maybe he's got a key.\\
463 - You want to go through his pockets?\\
464 - Not particularly.\\
465 - Why don't we just leave him on the porch,\\
466 - ring the bell, and run?\\
467 - He's not a bag of flaming dog poo.\\
468 - No, that was Judith's first husband.\\
469 - Oop, dirty look-- where's my beer?\\
470 - (sighs) All right, all right.\\
471 - I'll go through his pockets.\\
472 - (both grunt)\\
473 - Oh, Judith.\\
474 - What the hell is going on here?\\
475 - * Men...\\
476 - (sighs) Well, that was close.\\
477 - No, it wasn't close.\\
478 - Close is when you get away with it.\\
479 - That was nowhere near close.\\
480 - All right, all right, it doesn't matter.\\
481 - He had a good time, he's going to marry Judith,\\
482 - and I'm off the hook for alimony.\\
483 - That's true.\\
484 - Hey, Alan?\\
485 - Yeah?\\
486 - You did erase the video from his cell phone, right?\\
487 - (chuckles) Oh, boy, it'd be really stupid if I didn't.\\
488 - Yes, it would.\\
489 - CHARLIE (over phone): Hey, Herb!\\
490 - Attaboy! (softly): You dumb bastard.\\
491 - Here you go. Thank you.\\
492 - And you.\\
493 - Okay, so that is one root beer...\\
494 - one orange soda.
\subsection {Episode 06: Apologies for the Frivolity}
1 - Here we are.\\
2 - Be it ever so humble.\\
3 - Wow, this is some house.\\
4 - If you ever decide to sell, I want the listing.\\
5 - Well, you'd have to kill my mom for it, so...\\
6 - sure.\\
7 - Can I make you a drink?\\
8 - Charlie, we both know I'm gonna sleep with you.\\
9 - You don't have to liquor me up.\\
10 - Hey, I've been doing this a long time.\\
11 - Trust me, you'll want a drink.\\
12 - Oh, hey.\\
13 - I didn't know you guys were home.\\
14 - Lydia, this is my brother Alan.\\
15 - Alan, hi.\\
16 - Hi.\\
17 - So sorry to hear about your troubles.\\
18 - Troubles? What troubles?\\
19 - Oh, maybe I have it wrong.\\
20 - Charlie, didn't you tell me he was divorced,\\
21 - broke and living on your couch?\\
22 - I don't know what she's talking about.\\
23 - Well, I am going through a bit of a rough patch,\\
24 - but I try not to think about it too much.\\
25 - Good for you.\\
26 - I'd be suicidal.\\
27 - You hear that? You have options.\\
28 - Anyway, this is my nephew Jake.\\
29 - Hello, Jake. Hi.\\
30 - So, what grade are you in?\\
31 - Seventh.\\
32 - Well, don't you worry when the other kids make fun of you.\\
33 - You'll show 'em someday.\\
34 - Nobody makes fun of me.\\
35 - You're kidding?\\
36 - Why would anyone make fun of me?\\
37 - And this is my housekeeper Berta.\\
38 - Berta, Lydia.\\
39 - Choose your words carefully, Slim.\\
40 - Slim?\\
41 - Why, thank you.\\
42 - I watch what I eat.\\
43 - Going in or coming out?\\
44 - Hey, why don't we forget the drinks, and go out\\
45 - on the deck and enjoy the sunset?\\
46 - All right. Well, it was so nice to meet all of you.\\
47 - Uh-huh. Yeah. Sure.\\
48 - You didn't have to be so rude.\\
49 - You said they were laughing with me.\\
50 - Hey, I got my own problems.\\
51 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
52 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
53 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
54 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
55 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
56 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
57 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
58 - No need to thank me.\\
59 - I wasn't going to.\\
60 - Excuse me?\\
61 - I mean, it was very nice,\\
62 - it's just if I'd known you were gonna camp down there\\
63 - I would've given you a lantern and some marshmallows.\\
64 - Hey, I was just trying to be thorough.\\
65 - You were showing off.\\
66 - No, no, if I were showing off\\
67 - I'd have done it with no hands.\\
68 - So I can expect this kind of effort\\
69 - every time we get in bed?\\
70 - Well, maybe not during flu season.\\
71 - And it's important to have variety.\\
72 - I'm not always gonna swing for the long ball,\\
73 - every once in a while I'll lay down a bunt,\\
74 - and how did you manage to turn this into a bad thing?\\
75 - It's not a bad thing.\\
76 - Thank you.\\
77 - Which is not to say if you were open to suggestion\\
78 - it couldn't be better.\\
79 - Oh, really?\\
80 - And how could it have been better?\\
81 - Ooh, looks like I pushed a button.\\
82 - Yeah, well, it looks like I didn't.\\
83 - Charlie...\\
84 - you can push an elevator button a hundred times,\\
85 - it still won't come any faster.\\
86 - Fine.\\
87 - Maybe next time I'll take the stairs.\\
88 - Oh, come on...\\
89 - don't be like that.\\
90 - You were magnificent.\\
91 - Astonishing.\\
92 - You've ruined me for other men.\\
93 - There, was that so hard?\\
94 - You boys and your little egos.\\
95 - Okay, okay, stop.\\
96 - In this bed, we don't say "boys"\\
97 - and we don't say "little."\\
98 - Fine.\\
99 - You want me to try again?\\
100 - No, I'm a bit chafed.\\
101 - Let's make the next few minutes about pleasing you.\\
102 - A few minutes? That's all I get?\\
103 - Trust me, darling,\\
104 - with me, that's all you can handle.\\
105 - * Men...\\
106 - (TV playing)\\
107 - Hey, Dad? Yeah?\\
108 - Do you like Uncle Charlie's new girlfriend?\\
109 - Well, I just met her the one time, so...\\
110 - no, not really.\\
111 - You know who she reminds me of?\\
112 - The girls at school who think they rule the world\\
113 - just 'cause they got their boobs.\\
114 - Well, I hate to tell you, buddy,\\
115 - but they kinda do.\\
116 - I don't get it.\\
117 - I wouldn't be mean if I had boobs.\\
118 - That's very admirable.\\
119 - (girly voice): Hi there.\\
120 - I like you very much.\\
121 - Please don't do that.\\
122 - Do what? I'm just being nice.\\
123 - I'm serious. Cut it out.\\
124 - Hey.\\
125 - Hey.\\
126 - (girly voice): Hello, big boy.\\
127 - You really need to get him into a sport.\\
128 - I'll need a sports bra.\\
129 - I said quit it.\\
130 - What are you watching?\\
131 - I don't know, some Disney crap.\\
132 - Where's your girlfriend?\\
133 - Hey, my boob!\\
134 - She had to go pick up her kids.\\
135 - Probably from therapy.\\
136 - What's that supposed to mean?\\
137 - We don't like her.\\
138 - Who's "we"?\\
139 - Me and Dad.\\
140 - No, no, I d... uh...\\
141 - That's, that's not...\\
142 - I mean, she seems really...\\
143 - No, we don't like her.\\
144 - All right, she might be a bit outspoken,\\
145 - but I happen to find that very attractive.\\
146 - She must be dynamite in the sack.\\
147 - Where do you get this stuff from?\\
148 - Cinemax.\\
149 - Well, not that my sex life is any of your business...\\
150 - It's not his business.\\
151 - It's nobody's business.\\
152 - So, what does she do for a living?\\
153 - Besides being a stone cold bee-yatch.\\
154 - HBO.\\
155 - She sells real estate.\\
156 - Oh, like Mom.\\
157 - No, not like Mom.\\
158 - Lydia sells high-end homes in Beverly Hills,\\
159 - and Mom sells high-end homes...\\
160 - mostly on the beach.\\
161 - What are you getting so defensive about?\\
162 - I'm not getting defensive!\\
163 - Lydia sells homes on the bee-yatch.\\
164 - All right, all right, that's it. Go to bed.\\
165 - I wasn't mean before I got my boobs.\\
166 - Boy, puberty is gonna hit him like a shovel.\\
167 - * Men...\\
168 - Good to have you back, Mr. Harper. Thank you, Bobby.\\
169 - We haven't seen your mother here for quite some time.\\
170 - Well, maybe you just didn't recognize her.\\
171 - Like Satan, my mother can take many forms.\\
172 - (chuckles): Good one.\\
173 - I'm ready to order.\\
174 - Of course.\\
175 - Apologies for the frivolity.\\
176 - What would you like?\\
177 - I'll have the seared ahi tuna filet.\\
178 - Good choice. I want it very rare.\\
179 - That's how we serve it. I want it red in the middle, not pink.\\
180 - Shall do. If it's pink, don't even bother bringing it.\\
181 - Got it. Just give it to someone who doesn't know what rare is.\\
182 - Of course. You know what? Forget it.\\
183 - You won't get it right.\\
184 - Is your salmon fresh?\\
185 - Flown in today.\\
186 - What time?\\
187 - I'll ask the chef.\\
188 - Many forms. I thought you were joking.\\
189 - You eat here regularly?\\
190 - Not anymore.\\
191 - So, listen, about this weekend.\\
192 - My ex is going to be out of town,\\
193 - so I'll have the kids.\\
194 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, Lydia, no one loves the little ones\\
195 - more than old Uncle Charlie,\\
196 - but don't you think it might be a bit soon\\
197 - for me to meet your kids?\\
198 - Oh, I don't want you to meet them.\\
199 - Why not?\\
200 - Because I'm very careful\\
201 - about who I expose them to.\\
202 - What's that supposed to mean? Charlie, please.\\
203 - Why can't I expose myself to your kids?\\
204 - I mean, why can't I meet your kids?\\
205 - Please don't make me hurt your feelings.\\
206 - You can't hurt my feelings.\\
207 - All right, fine.\\
208 - You're a professional boy toy,\\
209 - a perpetual adolescent leading a dissolute life.\\
210 - You may have your uses,\\
211 - but you're not the kind of man I want around my children.\\
212 - Oh.\\
213 - What made you think that would hurt my feelings?\\
214 - 2:00. Jet Blue from Vancouver.\\
215 - Would you like me to find out what the movie was?\\
216 - Don't bother, I'll just have the capellini.\\
217 - And I'll have the pork chop with a baked potato.\\
218 - How about a little angioplasty for dessert?\\
219 - Hey, I like a nice pork chop once in a while.\\
220 - Fine, I'm not going to tell you how to eat.\\
221 - Really?\\
222 - Even if I chew slowly for your pleasure?\\
223 - (waiter clears throat)\\
224 - So, yay or nay on the pork chop?\\
225 - I'll have the spinach and goat cheese salad.\\
226 - Good choice. Thank you.\\
227 - On the food.\\
228 - * Men...\\
229 - How many pieces of bacon are you going to eat?\\
230 - My record's 14.\\
231 - I barfed, but it still counts.\\
232 - Do you know what's going to happen\\
233 - if you continue to eat like this?\\
234 - Yeah, I'm gonna barf.\\
235 - Alan, doesn't this poor child\\
236 - already have enough strikes against him?\\
237 - He's fine, Mom.\\
238 - All right, but when Jerry Springer has to knock down a wall\\
239 - just to get him out of his house,\\
240 - don't come crying to me.\\
241 - That wasn't Jerry, that was Dr. Phil.\\
242 - I'm not saying it wasn't a turn-on,\\
243 - I just think you need to trim a fingernail.\\
244 - Oh. Hey, Mom.\\
245 - Uh, Mom, this is Lydia. Lydia, my mother.\\
246 - Oh, pleased to meet you.\\
247 - Likewise.\\
248 - Boy, I'm glad I stopped coming to work high.\\
249 - * Men...\\
250 - I mean, besides my son.\\
251 - I'm in real estate.\\
252 - How interesting, so am I.\\
253 - Oh, yes. Evelyn Harper.\\
254 - I recognize you from your bus bench ads.\\
255 - People all over town are sitting on your face.\\
256 - Well, dear, maybe someday,\\
257 - if you work hard, people will be sitting\\
258 - on your face, too.\\
259 - Thank you. Although when I get to be your age,\\
260 - I hope I won't be schlepping to open houses\\
261 - in order to make a buck.\\
262 - (chuckles) Don't say "schlep," darling.\\
263 - You're a bit too vanilla to pull it off.\\
264 - So, Charlie, how long have you\\
265 - been seeing this lovely woman?\\
266 - Uh... how long has it been, sweetie?\\
267 - Are you telling me you don't remember when we met?\\
268 - The way he drinks?\\
269 - There's a good chance he doesn't remember coming down the stairs.\\
270 - Did his father drink?\\
271 - What choice did he have?\\
272 - Charlie, don't be snide.\\
273 - And stand up straight.\\
274 - This is so weird.\\
275 - EVELYN: Well, I really must run.\\
276 - Oh, me, too-- can I walk you out? Oh, how nice.\\
277 - Are you sure you don't want to stay\\
278 - and finish putting on your makeup?\\
279 - That's okay, I'm done.\\
280 - Would you like to borrow some?\\
281 - No, thanks, I'm allergic to the drugstore brands.\\
282 - What?\\
283 - And they call you slow.\\
284 - You're kidding, right?\\
285 - You don't see it?\\
286 - See what?\\
287 - Lydia and Mom.\\
288 - What about them?\\
289 - Come on, Charlie. The only difference\\
290 - between those two broads is you came out of one and you're...\\
291 - CHARLIE: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
292 - Hold on, hold on.\\
293 - You think Lydia's like Mom?\\
294 - No. We think Lydia is Mom.\\
295 - Okay, okay, you guys are nuts.\\
296 - And this conversation is over.\\
297 - Who calls me slow?\\
298 - * Men...\\
299 - And I'll tell you another thing.\\
300 - There's a lot of women in this town who work in real estate.\\
301 - I thought this conversation was over.\\
302 - They all wear the suits and the designer bags.\\
303 - It's like a uniform.\\
304 - They could be firemen.\\
305 - And Mom's Lexus is a two-door,\\
306 - while Lydia's Lexus is a four-door.\\
307 - Worlds apart.\\
308 - It is worlds apart.\\
309 - The two-door is a selfish car.\\
310 - The four-door is a family car.\\
311 - And you know why Lydia has a family car?\\
312 - Because Lydia has children.\\
313 - Unlike our mother.\\
314 - Shut up.\\
315 - Charlie, it's okay.\\
316 - You've been working out your maternal issues\\
317 - by having sex with other women your entire life.\\
318 - All you're doing now is cutting out the middle man.\\
319 - Oh, that is just sick.\\
320 - My point exactly.\\
321 - (muttering): Stupid idiot.\\
322 - You're just jealous.\\
323 - Lydia's smart, funny, and sexy, way sexier than Mom.\\
324 - Not that I think Mom is sexy.\\
325 - New thought, new thought, new thought.\\
326 - Oh, Charlie.\\
327 - If you could get rid of disturbing thoughts that easily,\\
328 - I wouldn't be making a quilt out of your old underwear.\\
329 - Hi, Rose.\\
330 - I brought you a little gift.\\
331 - OedipusRex?\\
332 - It's about a guy who sleeps with his mother\\
333 - and then pokes his eyes out.\\
334 - I'm giving away the ending,\\
335 - because I'm afraid you might be blind\\
336 - by the time you get to it.\\
337 - Where do you get this stuff?\\
338 - You've never even seen Lydia.\\
339 - No, you've never seen me see her.\\
340 - Lydia is nothing like my mother.\\
341 - Why would I get involved with a woman\\
342 - who even slightly resembles the monster who bore me?\\
343 - (chuckling): Oh, are you going to love this book.\\
344 - (sighing): Here.\\
345 - Mom wants to talk to you.\\
346 - Oh, great.\\
347 - Hi, Mom.\\
348 - Oh, Lydia.\\
349 - (softly): Very funny.\\
350 - I thought so.\\
351 - I liked it. (chuckles)\\
352 - So what's up?\\
353 - Are you still coming over tomorrow?\\
354 - I thought your ex had the kids.\\
355 - Okay, well, why don't you bring them over?\\
356 - Oh, please, how could I possibly embarrass you?\\
357 - No, no, no, no, no, no, I only do that when I'm drunk.\\
358 - Look, I swear, I'll be on my best behavior.\\
359 - Great. I'll see you then, Mom...\\
360 - of the year!\\
361 - Well, in my book you are.\\
362 - One word, and everybody gets their eyes poked out.\\
363 - * Men...\\
364 - Why do I have to play with kids I don't know?\\
365 - Because Lydia's bringing them over,\\
366 - and I didn't have time to rent a clown.\\
367 - Are they boys or girls?\\
368 - Beats me.\\
369 - How old are they?\\
370 - Not a clue.\\
371 - Sounds like fun.\\
372 - Hey, they're kids, you're a kid.\\
373 - How tough could it be?\\
374 - I mean, we're not breeding pandas here.\\
375 - All right, but if they're boys,\\
376 - just don't call them "little dudes," okay?\\
377 - Why not?\\
378 - There was this guy Mom used to date,\\
379 - and every time he'd see me, he'd call me "little dude."\\
380 - He was an idiot.\\
381 - Okay, okay, that's good stuff.\\
382 - What else you got?\\
383 - No lame magic tricks, no head rubbing,\\
384 - and please, no high fives.\\
385 - Got it.\\
386 - And don't ask, "Who wants ice cream?"\\
387 - Everybody wants ice cream.\\
388 - I understand.\\
389 - Even lactose-intolerant kids want ice cream.\\
390 - Makes sense.\\
391 - But whatever you do, don't try to pretend you're\\
392 - not sleeping with their mom. We're not stupid.\\
393 - So if I do this stuff, her kids will like me?\\
394 - No. Why not?\\
395 - You're doing their mom.\\
396 - (doorbell rings)\\
397 - Hello, Lydia.\\
398 - Hey, little dudes, give me five.\\
399 - (chuckling): All right.\\
400 - That's what I'm talking about.\\
401 - (softly): Don't worry, he's not the one I'm dating.\\
402 - There they are. Welcome.\\
403 - Hello, Charlie.\\
404 - These are my sons, Andy and Joey.\\
405 - Nice to meet you guys.\\
406 - (coughing): Wrong.\\
407 - Shake hands with him, darlings.\\
408 - Hi.\\
409 - Hey.\\
410 - (scoffs) Not like that.\\
411 - Shake hands like a man. I am!\\
412 - Do you always have to embarrass me?\\
413 - (laughs)\\
414 - What are you laughing at?\\
415 - You're no prize, either.\\
416 - Oh.\\
417 - What?\\
418 - Nothing.\\
419 - Excuse me.\\
420 - (Charlie screaming)\\
421 - Hey, who wants ice cream?\\
422 - * Men...\\
423 - You don't want to turn into a big tub of goo like your father.\\
424 - And those are expensive new shirts.\\
425 - If you stain them, don't even bother coming back.\\
426 - What now?\\
427 - Oh. Nothing, nothing.\\
428 - I was just thinking about mothers\\
429 - and kids and crying.\\
430 - So much crying.\\
431 - Well, what do you think of my boys?\\
432 - Oh, they're-they're terrific.\\
433 - And the way you interact with them is so... unbelievable.\\
434 - Thank you.\\
435 - The older one has a chance.\\
436 - The younger one, I'm afraid, is a lost cause.\\
437 - Anyway,\\
438 - we have the house to ourselves.\\
439 - Do you feel like going upstairs?\\
440 - Uh, yeah, that's a, uh, interesting idea.\\
441 - What's the matter, Charlie?\\
442 - It's kind of hard to explain.\\
443 - Well, why don't we go get naked\\
444 - and see if that loosens your tongue?\\
445 - I got my nails done.\\
446 - Oh, why not?\\
447 - I'm going to hell, anyway.

15 - No, you got the right address.\\
16 - Charlie, it's for you!\\
17 - Who is it?\\
18 - Karma.\\
19 - What?\\
20 - Your chickens have come home to roost.\\
21 - Chickens? Karma?\\

34 - again.\\
35 - I don't think we've met.\\
36 - Really?\\
37 - Really.\\
38 - Are you trying to give me a stroke?\\
39 - Is that what you're trying to do?\\
40 - Well, it's about time.\\
41 - Oh, hey, Mom.\\
42 - I got the cleaning stuff you wanted.\\
43 - Well, don't just stand there.\\
44 - Get in the kitchen and start using it.\\
45 - Fine.\\
46 - Berta, aren't you going to introduce us?\\
47 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
48 - Where are my manners?\\
49 - Charlie, Alan,\\
50 - I'd like you to meet my youngest daughter Naomi--\\
51 - the light of my life.\\
52 - A little angel who swooped down from heaven\\
53 - and landed on a married man's penis.\\
54 - Mom!\\
55 - And when she got knocked up and lost her job,\\
56 - she had to come live with me.\\
57 - They fired you for being pregnant?\\
58 - Yep. Being pregnant\\
59 - and stealing a few office supplies.\\
60 - Eight computers and a Xerox machine.\\
61 - Not all at once.\\
62 - So which one of you guys\\
63 - is the rich one who likes to party?\\
64 - Get to work.\\
65 - All right.\\
66 - And when you're done in the kitchen,\\
67 - you can scrub the toilets.\\
68 - All right!\\
69 - she wouldn't be in this situation.\\
70 - Not necessarily.\\
71 - Should she really be scrubbing toilets in her condition?\\
72 - Hey, when I was pregnant with her\\
73 - I worked right up until my water broke.\\
74 - And then I used the water to mop the floor.\\
75 - I exaggerate for effect.\\
76 - Wow.\\
77 - Yeah, and we think our family's screwed-up.\\
78 - No, no, I meant, "Wow, Naomi is hot."\\
79 - What?\\
80 - Come on. She's ripe and luscious.\\
81 - I just want to caress that taut, voluptuous belly\\
82 - and, you know...\\
83 - Ungh...\\
84 - Who are you?\\
85 - Oh, come on, you can't tell me you don't appreciate\\
86 - the beauty of a woman in that condition.\\
87 - Okay, look, freako.\\
88 - I get the aesthetic appeal\\
89 - of a woman with the glow of motherhood,\\
90 - a new life growing inside of her, blah, blah, blah.\\
91 - But long story short--\\
92 - once there's a bun in the oven,\\
93 - I don't feel the need to butter it.\\
94 - Well, then you have missed out\\
95 - on one of the great sexual experiences a man can have.\\
96 - There had to be one.\\
97 - When Judith was pregnant with Jake,\\
98 - I-I don't know if it was hormones\\
99 - or pheromones, but she just could not get enough of me.\\
100 - And ever since then, every time I see a pregnant woman,\\
101 - I just...\\
102 - (moans)\\
103 - Okay, seriously, you got to stop that.\\
104 - I am telling you, it was nine months\\
105 - of the hottest sex we've ever had,\\
106 - even with the morning sickness and hemorrhoids.\\
107 - Maybe that explains Jake's grades.\\
108 - Morning sickness and hemorrhoids?\\
109 - No, the repeated blows to his unformed head.\\
110 - You are such an idiot.\\
111 - All the experts agree that sex during pregnancy\\
112 - is not harmful to the baby.\\
113 - Experts, shmexperts.\\
114 - Tonight when you're sleeping, I'm gonna come in\\
115 - and start poking you in the ear with a hot dog.\\
116 - See how you like it.\\
117 - Okay, okay, clearly, we have different opinions.\\
118 - All I know is, I find pregnant women\\
119 - very erotic.\\
120 - Oh, hey, buddy.\\
121 - Hi.\\
122 - How long have you been standing there?\\
123 - Long enough to be very confused.\\
124 - But we have hot dogs, right?\\
125 - * Men\\
126 - (moans)\\
127 - Excuse me?\\
128 - Oh, it's just a little indigestion.\\
129 - So, uh, she's got you doing a little ironing, huh?\\
130 - Yeah. Boy, I can't wait to get this day over with\\
131 - and take a nice, hot bath.\\
132 - (moans)\\
133 - You know, uh,\\
134 - we happen to have a Jacuzzi tub.\\
135 - It, uh, has those jets and...\\
136 - I'm okay.\\
137 - I'm okay.\\
138 - (laughing): Are you sure?\\
139 - Yeah, yeah, fine.\\
140 - You, uh, you want me to run some water for you?\\
141 - No, no, I couldn't.\\
142 - I got to keep working\\
143 - or my mom'll be all over me like hair on soap.\\
144 - Mm, you, uh, you do paint a picture.\\
145 - But still, you, you shouldn't be working in your condition.\\
146 - Come on, just, uh, just sit here.\\
147 - I'll, uh, I'll finish it for you.\\
148 - Really?\\
149 - Yes, really.\\
150 - Why, thank you.\\
151 - (both laugh)\\
152 - You're not doing a very good job anyway.\\
153 - Ooh.\\
154 - Hot.\\
155 - So, you know what the baby is?\\
156 - Well, I'm hoping for human.\\
157 - Uh, no, no, I meant boy or girl?\\
158 - Oh, it's a girl.\\
159 - Oh, oh, that's nice.\\
160 - I always wanted a girl.\\
161 - I mean, you know, I love my son, but let's face it,\\
162 - girls are so much smarter and more spiritual than boys.\\
163 - Plus, we got all the boobies.\\
164 - All the good ones anyway.\\
165 - Course, right now, mine feel like two big bags of wet sand.\\
166 - Nice.\\
167 - My back is killing me, my feet are swollen,\\
168 - and I'm passing gas like a NASCAR pit crew.\\
169 - Well, I-I think you look... beautiful.\\
170 - Aren't you sweet?\\
171 - Ooh. God, it feels\\
172 - like she's playing Hacky Sack in there.\\
173 - Wanna feel? Yes.\\
174 - Come on.\\
175 - What's going on here?\\
176 - Oh, hi, Berta.\\
177 - The baby was kicking and Naomi asked me\\
178 - if I wanted to feel the baby kicking and I said, "Sure,"\\
179 - which is when you walked in, and that's pretty much it.\\
180 - Okay. Yes, it is okay.\\
181 - It is okay.\\
182 - Hey, you're having a new granddaughter.\\
183 - W-What a blessing, huh?\\
184 - Yeah, sort of takes the sting out of this one\\
185 - being a gullible tramp.\\
186 - Now, get off your rump roast and finish the ironing.\\
187 - Oh, wait, relax, Berta, I'll do the ironing.\\
188 - Why don't you just let Naomi take it easy?\\
189 - Easy's the reason she's in this condition.\\
190 - Get to it. All right.\\
191 - You know, if, if your back is really bothering you,\\
192 - I'm a chiropractor... Zippy!\\
193 - Yes? Conference.\\
194 - Yes.\\
195 - Zippy is kind of an affectionate nickname...\\
196 - 'cause I'm quick.\\
197 - What are you doing?\\
198 - I'm trying to teach that girl responsibility.\\
199 - She's going to be a single mother with no job skills.\\
200 - I want her to be able to support herself with some dignity.\\
201 - Oh, please, what kind of dignity can a woman have\\
202 - ironing clothes and cleaning strangers' toilets?\\
203 - I'll tell you what kind.\\
204 - The dignity of an honest buck for an honest day's labor.\\
205 - Hats off to the working gal. Excuse me.\\
206 - * Men\\
207 - (sobbing)\\
208 - (sniffling)\\
209 - Berta? Go away.\\
210 - Uh, I actually need to use the bathroom.\\
211 - Well, I'm using this one.\\
212 - Are you okay?\\
213 - Yeah, Charlie, I am just aces.\\
214 - All right, uh...\\
215 - Would you like a magazine?\\
216 - Go... away.\\
217 - (sniffles)\\
218 - Berta, I'm coming in.\\
219 - Is it okay if I come in?\\
220 - Hi.\\
221 - (sniffling)\\
222 - I didn't want you to see me like this.\\
223 - Yeah, well, it's better\\
224 - than the image I had in my mind.\\
225 - What's wrong?\\
226 - What do you think?\\
227 - Your daughter?\\
228 - I had such hopes for her.\\
229 - Of all of my girls, she was the smart one.\\
230 - She was the smart one?\\
231 - Go on.\\
232 - I really thought\\
233 - Naomi would make something of herself, you know?\\
234 - A career, a family.\\
235 - A house that wasn't just a horse trailer\\
236 - with a futon in it.\\
237 - Don't blame yourself.\\
238 - It's not your fault.\\
239 - Who said anything about being my fault, you nimrod?\\
240 - No, no, no, no, no.\\
241 - I'm-I'm just saying that-that you did the best you could.\\
242 - How the hell do you know?\\
243 - Actually, I-I don't.\\
244 - But I am something of an expert on where girls go wrong.\\
245 - When-When they start sleeping around,\\
246 - it-it's usually a daddy thing.\\
247 - At least in my experience.\\
248 - Thanks for trying to cheer me up, Charlie.\\
249 - You're welcome.\\
250 - But you can stop now,\\
251 - 'cause it ain't your forte.\\
252 - Okay.\\
253 - I'll tell you whose fault it is.\\
254 - Ronald Wiedermeier.\\
255 - Who?\\
256 - The sleazeball who pollinated my little flower\\
257 - then disappeared like cupcakes at a pot party.\\
258 - Damn that Ronald Niedermeier.\\
259 - Wiedermeier.\\
260 - Him, too.\\
261 - Well, I'll tell ya, I am not gonna let him get away with it.\\
262 - Good for you.\\
263 - Guys like that need to know\\
264 - that there's consequences to their actions.\\
265 - They need to learn that-that women are people with feelings.\\
266 - They're not just vaginas that talk.\\
267 - "Vaginas that talk"?\\
268 - Damn that Ronald Wiedermeier.\\
269 - You know, Charlie, you may be a pig,\\
270 - but in this case, you're right.\\
271 - Thank you.\\
272 - What did I say?\\
273 - We need to teach Mr. Wiedermeier a lesson.\\
274 - I don't think I said that.\\
275 - Come on.\\
276 - No, really, I-I am almost positive\\
277 - I didn't say that.\\
278 - You know, I still have to pee.\\
279 - * Men.\\
280 - Where the hell are we?\\
281 - It's called Rancho Pacoima.\\
282 - Huh.\\
283 - It's very... brown.\\
284 - Yeah, not much grows here except meth labs and cold sores.\\
285 - Just out of curiosity,\\
286 - what exactly are we hoping to accomplish\\
287 - here with this Ronald guy?\\
288 - Well, in the perfect world, he'd dump his wife\\
289 - and marry my little hose bag.\\
290 - But I'll settle for him stepping up\\
291 - and paying for his mistake.\\
292 - And if he declines?\\
293 - That's why I brought you.\\
294 - Me?\\
295 - All I can do at this point is pee on his rug.\\
296 - You still have to go?\\
297 - Well, yeah, it doesn't evaporate.\\
298 - Can we pull over for a minute?\\
299 - In this neighborhood in a Mercedes?\\
300 - Sure, if you're partial to car theft and sodomy.\\
301 - Take a left right here.\\
302 - That's not a road.\\
303 - Well, not during rainy season.\\
304 - (thud)\\
305 - Oh, God!\\
306 - I think I hit a dog!\\
307 - Don't worry. It was just a rat.\\
308 - It's okay. He's getting up.\\
309 - * Men.\\
310 - (giggles)\\
311 - What's this stuff called again?\\
312 - Vitamin E oil. Oh.\\
313 - Feels really good.\\
314 - Ah...\\
315 - (doorbell rings)\\
316 - Hey, Mom. I'm ready to go.\\
317 - Where's your father?\\
318 - He's in the den rubbing oil on Naomi.\\
319 - Who's Naomi?\\
320 - Berta's daughter.\\
321 - Your father's rubbing oil on a woman in front of you?\\
322 - Nah. I couldn't watch.\\
323 - It was too creepy.\\
324 - Well, we'll just see about that.\\
325 - Oh, and by the way, I found out why I get bad grades.\\
326 - It's all your fault.\\
327 - Why is it my fault?\\
328 - You know.\\
329 - NAOMI: Oh, yeah, Alan.\\
330 - ALAN: Ah...\\
331 - Wait in the car.\\
332 - Alan, what do you think you're doing?\\
333 - Oh, hi, Judith.\\
334 - Naomi here was worried about stretch marks,\\
335 - and I was showing her how vitamin E can help prevent them.\\
336 - You know, like I did with you.\\
337 - And then you walked in, and that's pretty much it.\\
338 - Oh, really?\\
339 - Yeah. Hey, why don't you pull up your top\\
340 - and let her check out your belly?\\
341 - I will not!\\
342 - So he rubbed this on you, too?\\
343 - Oh, he rubbed all right,\\
344 - but it was only to satisfy his own twisted needs.\\
345 - Excuse me, but you were the one that was constantly horny.\\
346 - And you sure took advantage of it, didn't you?\\
347 - Hey, when the bar is only open nine months a decade,\\
348 - you drink till you puke.\\
349 - And then you keep drinking.\\
350 - (Jake laughs)\\
351 - That's funny.\\
352 - Hey, buddy.\\
353 - You're turning into quite the little ninja, aren't you?\\
354 - There's just one thing I don't understand.\\
355 - Well, wha-what's that, honey?\\
356 - If you have sex with a pregnant lady,\\
357 - wouldn't she have twins?\\
358 - No.\\
359 - Otherwise, I'd be having a whole damn litter.\\
360 - * Men.\\
361 - (dogs barking)\\
362 - Lot of cold medicine.\\
363 - He must have allergies or something.\\
364 - You don't watch 60Minutes, do you?\\
365 - (bumping and thudding)\\
366 - What?\\
367 - You Ronald?\\
368 - No.\\
369 - WOMAN: Ronald, who is it?\\
370 - Damn it, Darlene. We're incognito, remember?\\
371 - You cops?\\
372 - Yeah.\\
373 - I'm Scully. This is Mulder.\\
374 - Listen, can I use your bathroom?\\
375 - No, no, it's, uh, not functioning... correctly.\\
376 - We use the Chevron up the block.\\
377 - Bye.\\
378 - No bye-bye.\\
379 - So, Ronald, this is the deal.\\
380 - You've knocked up my little girl,\\
381 - and I want to know what you're gonna do about it.\\
382 - Well, that depends.\\
383 - On what?\\
384 - Who's your little girl?\\
385 - Naomi.\\
386 - Naomi?\\
387 - Oh, I haven't seen Naomi in a real long time.\\
388 - About eight, nine months?\\
389 - Yeah, that sounds right.\\
390 - Ew.\\
391 - DARLENE: Ronald, what's going on?\\
392 - Nothing, sweet cheeks.\\
393 - Okay, look,\\
394 - I'd like to keep this away from the missus.\\
395 - She's a little volatile.\\
396 - Hasn't slept really well.\\
397 - Maybe you've got a coffee can or a milk jug?\\
398 - I could just go around back?\\
399 - No, no, it's a real mess back there.\\
400 - (explosive pop)\\
401 - Ooh!\\
402 - Damn it, Darlene. I told you not to smoke in there.\\
403 - Well, I don't have to pee anymore.\\
404 - * Men.\\
405 - Oh!\\
406 - That feels so good.\\
407 - (breaks wind)\\
408 - Sorry.\\
409 - Oh, no, don't be silly.\\
410 - It's a... It's a natural bodily function. Oh.\\
411 - The, uh, the baby is-is pressing down on the intestines and...\\
412 - Oh, dear Lord!\\
413 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
414 - Oh, no, no. No, it's-it's all right. Okay.\\
415 - Uh, I'm used to it.\\
416 - When my wife was pregnant...\\
417 - Oh, that's got some hang time.\\
418 - You are so sweet, Alan.\\
419 - How come I've never met a man like you?\\
420 - Well, speaking on behalf of men like me,\\
421 - we don't get out a lot.\\
422 - (breaks wind)\\
423 - Sorry.\\
424 - I'm not.\\
425 - You know, these sweatpants are really comfortable.\\
426 - That's 'cause they're dry.\\
427 - And boy, what a deal.\\
428 - What did you call that place again?\\
429 - A swap meet.\\
430 - Swap meet.\\
431 - Well, aside from the exploding meth lab and peeing myself,\\
432 - this was a fun little trip.\\
433 - I got the sweatpants and a bag of tube socks,\\
434 - four DVDs and a corn dog, all for eight bucks.\\
435 - Just a hint.\\
436 - The corn dog will last longer than the socks.\\
437 - NAOMI: Oh, God! Oh!\\
438 - Oh, it's too big!\\
439 - What the hell?\\
440 - Alan, you sick freak.\\
441 - Naomi!\\
442 - Oh, hi. She's having a baby.\\
443 - BERTA: Oh, damn!\\
444 - It's all right, honey. Mommy's here.\\
445 - (Naomi moaning)\\
446 - Ooh...\\
447 - What? You never saw an angry one before?\\
448 - Out of the way, Zippy.\\
449 - It's okay. I'm a chiropractor.\\
450 - (screaming and sobbing)\\
451 - You got it.\\
452 - It's okay, honey. That's it, yeah.\\
453 - Now take a big deep breath and push!\\
454 - Yeah, whoa, whoa, hold on! hold on!\\
455 - Let me put down some tube socks!\\
456 - Breathe.\\
457 - Breathe. Now, push!\\
458 - (pained groaning and crying)\\
459 - Push!\\
460 - (screaming)\\
461 - * Men.\\
462 - Now, you listen up, Brittany Pam,\\
463 - you're my last chance.\\
464 - You're gonna go to college,\\
465 - and you're gonna make something of yourself.\\
466 - No getting knocked up\\
467 - by some greasy tweeker from Rancho Pacoima.\\
468 - Oh, gee, Mom, about that.\\
469 - I've-I've kind of been counting back the weeks,\\
470 - and Ronald can't be the daddy.\\
471 - What?\\
472 - Yeah. See, he was in a burn unit at the time.\\
473 - He wanted to, but his skin just kept sliding off.\\
474 - Oh, God.\\
475 - Here comes the corn dog.\\
476 - So... so, who is the father?\\
477 - Well, I got it narrowed down.\\
478 - Hmm. Dear Lord.\\
479 - I'll know for sure if she starts speaking Spanish.\\
480 - Well, we just shut down Ronald for $5,000.\\
481 - "We"?\\
482 - You were hiding behind the car, pulling off your wet undies.\\
483 - Oh, make yourself comfortable.\\
484 - The doctor will be right in.\\
485 - (moaning)\\
486 - Come on, freako.\\
487 - You are absolutely radiant.\\
488 - Best of luck.\\
489 - Thanks. Sorry about your couch.\\
490 - Good news, honey: I got you $4,000.

1 - Ah! Oh! Oh!\\
2 - Oh! Oh!\\
3 - Oh, God!\\
4 - Oh! Oh, God.\\
5 - Oh, God.\\
6 - (moaning)\\
7 - Oh, God. Oh...\\
8 - Oh, God. Oh. God.\\
9 - Oh, God.\\
10 - I was picturing something entirely different.\\
11 - I couldn't sleep.\\
12 - So you decided to make your nipples hard?\\
13 - Oh, the peas. No.\\
14 - I was heating up some milk and...\\
15 - You know, my nipple is hard.\\
16 - If you can't sleep, why don't you just take a pill?\\
17 - I don't believe in pills.\\
18 - What about booze?\\
19 - You believe in booze?\\
20 - That's not sleeping-- that's passing out.\\
21 - Pot-ay-to, pot-ah-to.\\
22 - I just, I have a lot on my mind.\\
23 - I don't need to drug myself.\\
24 - Okay, in that case I doknow a great,\\
25 - all-natural sleep aid.\\
26 - What's that?\\
27 - Sex. You should get yourself some sex.\\
28 - It'll put you right out. Charlie.\\
29 - Look at me. I can hardly keep my eyes open.\\
30 - Well, sex is not really an option at the moment.\\
31 - You're telling me you can't make a fist?\\
32 - Just leave me alone.\\
33 - How about exercise?\\
34 - It's kinda like sex, but without the condom.\\
35 - You know, that's not a bad idea.\\
36 - Well, you shouldalways wear a condom.\\
37 - No, I-I mean the exercise.\\
38 - I-I could go for a run on the beach.\\
39 - Sure, I've seen people do that.\\
40 - Usually they have a dog, but I think that's optional.\\
41 - Actually, that's a great idea.\\
42 - Oh, where you gonna get a dog at this hour.\\
43 - You really enjoy screwing with me, don't you?\\
44 - Well, you don't pay rent.\\
45 - You know what?\\
46 - I'm gonna do it.\\
47 - Pay rent?\\
48 - No...\\
49 - I'm gonna jog down to the pier and back.\\
50 - Maybe I can burn off my excess energy.\\
51 - Attaboy.\\
52 - Nah, I prefer the tater-tots.\\
53 - This will do it.\\
54 - Burn off the energy.\\
55 - That's interesting.\\
56 - (humming Chariots of Fire theme)\\
57 - Nice night for a run.\\
58 - How rude.\\
59 - HELICOPTER PILOT: This is the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department.\\
60 - Stop running and drop to the ground with your arms spread.\\
61 - Oh, no, no, no!\\
62 - You've got the wrong guy!\\
63 - The guy you want ran that way!\\
64 - This is your last warning.\\
65 - Drop to the ground with your arms spread.\\
66 - You don't understand!\\
67 - Follow me! I'll show you!\\
68 - (siren wailing)\\
69 - Put your hands behind your head and drop to your knees!\\
70 - No, no, you don't understand.\\
71 - I just couldn't sleep.\\
72 - Release the dogs!\\
73 - Dog-dogs?\\
74 - No, no, no...\\
75 - No dogs.\\
76 - (dogs barking)\\
77 - (dogs barking)\\
78 - All right, all right, I'm coming.\\
79 - (doorbell ringing)\\
80 - This better be good.\\
81 - Hey, it is good.\\
82 - Charlie, tell them who I am.\\
83 - I'm sorry, who are you?\\
84 - Charlie, if you don't tell them who I am,\\
85 - they're gonna take me to jail.\\
86 - Why do you keep calling me Charlie?\\
87 - Sir, is this man living here or not?\\
88 - Define "living."\\
89 - Charlie, I swear on my son's life...\\
90 - Yeah, he lives here.\\
91 - I told you.\\
92 - I've got your badge numbers. I am gonna write\\
93 - a scathing letter to... Shut up.\\
94 - Thank you, Officers.\\
95 - You are a credit to the Malibu community.\\
96 - You have a nice evening.\\
97 - At least this clown didn't ask if I was Jewish.\\
98 - So.\\
99 - How was your run?\\
100 - * Men.\\
101 - (drumming musically)\\
102 - (both drumming)\\
103 - (dishes rattle in time to the beat)\\
104 - Enough... drumming.\\
105 - Fine.\\
106 - Bass solo.\\
107 - * Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom... *\\
108 - Come on.\\
109 - I-I'd like to have a nice, quiet dinner.\\
110 - And I'd like you to be a keno waitress\\
111 - who can fit her entire hand in her mouth,\\
112 - but here you sit.\\
113 - I-I'm sorry, I'm a little cranky.\\
114 - I haven't slept in two days.\\
115 - Why don't you take a pill?\\
116 - He doesn't believe in pills.\\
117 - How can you not believe in them?\\
118 - They're on TV all the time.\\
119 - Let me tell you something, Jake.\\
120 - Big pharmaceutical companies want you to think\\
121 - you can take a pill for everything.\\
122 - Can't sleep? Take a pill.\\
123 - Can't wake up? Take a pill.\\
124 - Feeling sad? Take a pill.\\
125 - Can't get it up? Take a pill.\\
126 - Can't get what up?\\
127 - Can we just eat our dinner, please?\\
128 - Can I got back to Mom's tomorrow?\\
129 - Why?\\
130 - I want to hang out with my friends.\\
131 - What? All of a sudden your father's\\
132 - not good enough for you?\\
133 - It's not all of a sudden.\\
134 - Come on, Alan, the kid's growing up.\\
135 - He's got his own life now.\\
136 - All right, fine.\\
137 - How about you have your friends come over here?\\
138 - Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
139 - No kids in my house.\\
140 - I'm a kid.\\
141 - Well, I don't think of you as a kid.\\
142 - I think of you as more of a... gassy dwarf.\\
143 - Charlie,\\
144 - you said it yourself--\\
145 - he's growing up.\\
146 - Getting a life of his own.\\
147 - He'll be going off to college soon.\\
148 - I'll only see him on holidays...\\
149 - only hear from him when he needs money.\\
150 - Not that I'll have any.\\
151 - I'll still be paying alimony to two ex-wives.\\
152 - And college tuition?\\
153 - That just means selling an organ or turning tricks.\\
154 - And for what?\\
155 - So that he can get a worthless piece of paper\\
156 - that he can then fold into a hat\\
157 - to wear to the fast-food job\\
158 - that he will probably be fired from\\
159 - for stealing fries from the customers' bags.\\
160 - I dolike fries.\\
161 - * Men.\\
162 - (quietly): Sure, you can sleep.\\
163 - You have no conscience.\\
164 - Wake up!\\
165 - What?\\
166 - It's noon.\\
167 - What day?\\
168 - Saturday.\\
169 - Thanks. See you Sunday.\\
170 - Charlie, I have to go out.\\
171 - I need you to watch Jake and his friend.\\
172 - Friend?\\
173 - I thought I said no kids.\\
174 - You say lots of stuff.\\
175 - Twice a week you say you'll never drink again.\\
176 - I don't know what to believe anymore.\\
177 - Where are you going?\\
178 - I'm gonna have to run some errands.\\
179 - So take the kids with you.\\
180 - I can't.\\
181 - Then run your errands later.\\
182 - Oh, would you please just get\\
183 - your drunken ass out of bed\\
184 - and stop being a waste of skin for once in your life?!\\
185 - Well, since you said "please."\\
186 - Thank you.\\
187 - I'm, I'm sorry I barked at you.\\
188 - You still can't sleep, huh?\\
189 - No.\\
190 - Well, don't worry, I'm here for you.\\
191 - I'll keep an eye on the kids.\\
192 - I appreciate it.\\
193 - No problem.\\
194 - It's like he's never met me.\\
195 - Nothing seems to work.\\
196 - I-I've tried warm milk, exercise,\\
197 - meditation, self-hypnosis.\\
198 - Why don't you just take a pill?\\
199 - Because I don't need a pill.\\
200 - The root of my insomnia is psychological.\\
201 - That is why I'm sitting here with you, a psychologist.\\
202 - I'm a psychiatrist, a medical doctor,\\
203 - which is why I can prescribe pills.\\
204 - Is that some kind of shot at me\\
205 - because I'm just a chiropractor?\\
206 - No, of course not,\\
207 - but I am a real doctor.\\
208 - Look, can you help me or not?\\
209 - You know, delve into my subconscious\\
210 - and unravel the source of my problem?\\
211 - Sure, I'll give it a shot.\\
212 - So, when was the last time you had sex?\\
213 - This has nothing to do with sex!\\
214 - This has to do with alimony and ex-wives and child support\\
215 - an-and writing checks I can't cover\\
216 - and having to live on my brother's freaking hide-a-bed.\\
217 - Okay, why don't we start with your brother?\\
218 - What does my brother have to do with this?\\
219 - Who's the doctor here?\\
220 - Okay, that was a shot.\\
221 - You got me.\\
222 - Now tell me about your brother.\\
223 - What is there to say? Um...\\
224 - He's two years older than me, but much more immature.\\
225 - He's charming and easygoing.\\
226 - Of course, why shouldn't he be?\\
227 - He's never had to work for anything in his entire life.\\
228 - Money and women just seem to fall\\
229 - into his big, fat, lucky lap.\\
230 - So you resent him.\\
231 - Oh, no, I love him. He took me in\\
232 - when I needed a place to live.\\
233 - Okay. You say you love your brother,\\
234 - you're grateful for his help,\\
235 - and yet it must be difficult to watch him sail through life\\
236 - while you remain a complete and utter failure.\\
237 - I didn't say I was a complete failure.\\
238 - Huh.\\
239 - Why is it in my notes?\\
240 - Anyway, continue.\\
241 - Okay.\\
242 - Well, the worst part is\\
243 - that as selfish and promiscuous as Charlie is,\\
244 - he hasn't suffered any consequences.\\
245 - No palimony suits, no bullet wounds from angry husbands.\\
246 - Not so much as a lousy urinary tract infection.\\
247 - And yet you love him.\\
248 - Well, he's family.\\
249 - Oh... Oh, I get it.\\
250 - You think it's this internal contradiction\\
251 - that's the source of my insomnia.\\
252 - What do you think?\\
253 - I think you may be right.\\
254 - But how do I resolve it?\\
255 - Well, that's a good question.\\
256 - Unfortunately, we're out of time.\\
257 - Already?\\
258 - You dozed off for 40 minutes, Alan.\\
259 - You going to charge me for that?\\
260 - I was awake.\\
261 - All right, fine. Can I write you a check?\\
262 - Oh, boy.\\
263 - Alan, you know, when a patient tells me they're writing checks\\
264 - they can't cover, I kind of have a little cash only policy.\\
265 - All right, where's the closest ATM?\\
266 - Downstairs in the lobby.\\
267 - I'll be right back.\\
268 - I'll walk with you.\\
269 - * Men.\\
270 - (computer chimes)\\
271 - (chuckles)\\
272 - (computer chimes)\\
273 - (chuckles)\\
274 - (computer chimes)\\
275 - (chuckles)\\
276 - Hey.\\
277 - What you doing?\\
278 - Chatting.\\
279 - With who?\\
280 - Each other.\\
281 - But you're in the same room.\\
282 - (computer chimes) (laughing)\\
283 - What are you typing? Is that about me?\\
284 - No.\\
285 - (computer chimes)\\
286 - Down the hall on the right.\\
287 - BRB.\\
288 - "BRB"?\\
289 - "Be right back."\\
290 - Ah.\\
291 - Well... YAD.\\
292 - What's that?\\
293 - You're a dog.\\
294 - She's cute.\\
295 - She's just a friend.\\
296 - R-R-R-uff.\\
297 - What are you doing?\\
298 - Oh, come on, it's me you're talking to.\\
299 - The big dog.\\
300 - (howling)\\
301 - You're starting to freak me out.\\
302 - (doorbell rings)\\
303 - GIRL: That's my mom.\\
304 - I'll get it.\\
305 - Okay, okay, I lied-- I like her.\\
306 - Oh, really?\\
307 - Yeah. Woof.\\
308 - There you go.\\
309 - Wait, don't open the door.\\
310 - Why not? (doorbell ringing)\\
311 - Coming.\\
312 - Go to your room.\\
313 - What are you nuts?\\
314 - Please don't hit on her.\\
315 - Hit on who?\\
316 - Taylor's mom.\\
317 - Why would I hit on Taylor's mom?\\
318 - Well, because she's kind of pretty,\\
319 - and you'll hit on anything with a pulse.\\
320 - Where'd you get that?\\
321 - My mom.\\
322 - Oh, well...\\
323 - And my dad, Berta, Rose, Grandma...\\
324 - Okay, okay.\\
325 - The UPS man...\\
326 - All right.\\
327 - And when you hit on people I know,\\
328 - everything gets screwed up\\
329 - where I have to find a new guitar teacher,\\
330 - a new karate class, Cub Scout troop...\\
331 - Okay, okay, I get it.\\
332 - ...godmother.\\
333 - You don't have to worry.\\
334 - I'm not going to risk our friendship over "kind of pretty."\\
335 - So you won't hit on her?\\
336 - Absolutely not.\\
337 - Hi. I'm Taylor's mom.\\
338 - Scratch that.\\
339 - Great. Bye.\\
340 - You promised.\\
341 - No, no. No, no. The head that made the promise\\
342 - is not the one that broke it.\\
343 - And besides, you said she was just kind of pretty?\\
344 - Who do you consider hot?\\
345 - Taylor.\\
346 - Taylor's 12.\\
347 - Hello?\\
348 - Come on, what's the worst thing that could happen\\
349 - if I go out with your little friend's mom?\\
350 - Do I have to explain it to you again?\\
351 - My guitar teacher, my karate coach...\\
352 - Okay, okay.\\
353 - I can't show my face at the comic book store.\\
354 - All right, but the worst thing doesn't have to happen.\\
355 - Would you please just not go out with her?\\
356 - Tell you what-- I'll make you a deal.\\
357 - I'll give up Taylor's mom in exchange\\
358 - for you washing my car once a week for the next month.\\
359 - Done.\\
360 - That includes Turtle Wax, tire dressing\\
361 - and vacuuming the carpets. Oh, man.\\
362 - Hey, hey, hey, hey, the woman is recently divorced.\\
363 - I didn't ask for her number, she gave it to me.\\
364 - Do you know what that means? No.\\
365 - That means one, maybe two dinners, and...\\
366 - You're waxing my car.\\
367 - All right.\\
368 - You're lucky you're not painting the house.\\
369 - The sacrifices we make for our kids.\\
370 - Hey.\\
371 - Hey.\\
372 - You look like crap.\\
373 - Thank you. You look terrific.\\
374 - I feel terrific.\\
375 - The key is a good night's sleep.\\
376 - Yeah, listen, uh,\\
377 - I have to talk to you.\\
378 - This is a bad time, Alan. How come?\\
379 - Because you want to talk to me.\\
380 - Okay, what?\\
381 - Uh, you know I love you, right?\\
382 - Alan, are you breaking up with me?\\
383 - Would you just shut up and listen to me?\\
384 - Pick one, Alan.\\
385 - All right, all right, I talked to a therapist.\\
386 - And I think I learned something.\\
387 - Nah, too easy. Go ahead.\\
388 - The thing is...\\
389 - all these years of watching your life go so smoothly,\\
390 - while I stumble back and forth\\
391 - between humiliation and abject failure,\\
392 - has resulted in me harboring a lot of anger\\
393 - and jealousy towards you.\\
394 - Yeah, I get that.\\
395 - How could it not?\\
396 - Anyway, I think the tension between my love for you\\
397 - and my resentment of you is what's causing my insomnia.\\
398 - And?\\
399 - And I thought maybe if I got it out in the open,\\
400 - it might help me sleep.\\
401 - So how do you feel now?\\
402 - Better, actually.\\
403 - Like... like a weight has been lifted.\\
404 - Well, good.\\
405 - Yeah, maybe that's it.\\
406 - Maybe all I needed to do was unload.\\
407 - Well, a good unloading usually makes me drowsy.\\
408 - You're disgusting.\\
409 - True...\\
410 - but I sleep like a baby.\\
411 - And if I wake up fussy,\\
412 - there's always something nearby to put in my mouth.\\
413 - * Men.\\
414 - (whistling tune)\\
415 - I waxed your car.\\
416 - What? What are you doing up?\\
417 - You were out with Taylor's mom, weren't you?\\
418 - No, I wasn't.\\
419 - Are you sure?\\
420 - I think I know who I was out with.\\
421 - Okay, well, maybe you can explain this picture\\
422 - of your perfectly waxed car in Taylor's driveway.\\
423 - Where the hell'd you get that?\\
424 - Taylor took it with her phone and e-mailed it to me.\\
425 - Oh, okay.\\
426 - Not my car.\\
427 - What about this one of you\\
428 - kissing Taylor's mom in front of the car?\\
429 - Um...\\
430 - Photoshop.\\
431 - How was your date?\\
432 - Very nice.\\
433 - Bite me.\\
434 - Okay, well, good night.\\
435 - You said you wouldn't go out with her and you did.\\
436 - I had to, Jake.\\
437 - She called me.\\
438 - What difference does that make?\\
439 - I have to explain it to you?\\
440 - I have to explain everything to you.\\
441 - Okay, okay.\\
442 - Let's say you're a hunter.\\
443 - If a deer takes your gun, shoots itself,\\
444 - then straps itself to the roof of your car,\\
445 - you have to take it home and eat it.\\
446 - What?\\
447 - I'm sorry.\\
448 - I can't make it any clearer.\\
449 - If you keep seeing her, Uncle Charlie, you're gonna be sorry.\\
450 - Whoa.\\
451 - Is that a threat?\\
452 - No, it's a promise.\\
453 - What's the difference?\\
454 - I don't know-- one's a threat and one's a promise.\\
455 - (sighs)\\
456 - Oh, come on, buddy, let's be reasonable here.\\
457 - Your relationship with your little friend is what,\\
458 - instant messaging and holding hands at the pep rally?\\
459 - What's a pep rally?\\
460 - Just listen to me.\\
461 - Before you know it, you'll have forgotten all about Taylor.\\
462 - And you'll have forgotten all about her mother.\\
463 - No doubt.\\
464 - But I guarantee you I'll be forgetting a lot more\\
465 - than holding her hand at a pep rally.\\
466 - Last chance, Uncle Charlie.\\
467 - Ooh, I'm so scared.\\
468 - (mocking): Last chance, Uncle Charlie.\\

478 - He went that way.\\
479 - Great slime.\\
480 - Thanks.\\
481 - It's an old family recipe.\\

483 - MAN (over speaker): This is the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department!\\
484 - Get down on the sand with your arms spread!\\

1 - Nachos, Red Hots, Milk Duds, popcorn and a slushy.\\
2 - What are you doing, building an ass bomb?\\
3 - Pick two.\\
4 - Okay, popcorn and Milk Duds.\\
5 - Fine.\\
6 - Large popcorn.\\
7 - Okay.\\
8 - But I'll still need a slushy\\
9 - so I don't choke to death on a Milk Dud.\\
10 - All right.\\
11 - And ask then to put nacho cheese on the popcorn.\\
12 - Oh, that reminds me. I've got a date tonight.\\
13 - That reminds you?\\
14 - Yeah, and I'm gonna need your help.\\
15 - My help?\\
16 - Next. Hang on.\\
17 - Uh, a large popcorn with cheese,\\
18 - a large slushy and a jumbo box of Milk Duds.\\
19 - You want anything? My treat.\\
20 - I'm okay.\\
21 - I'll just eat whatever lands on the kid's shirt.\\
22 - You're gonna go hungry.\\
23 - That's it.\\
24 - So what about this date?\\
25 - Well, she got a friend visiting from out of town.\\
26 - I said, "Fine," you know?\\
27 - Two's company. Three's a sandwich.\\
28 - But for some reason,\\
29 - she insists on her friend having her own date.\\
30 - So you're asking me?\\
31 - Yeah.\\
32 - The two of us out making the scene\\
33 - with a couple hot chicks?\\
34 - Oh, Lord. Never mind.\\
35 - Don't be silly. It'll be fun.\\
36 - We never double.\\
37 - That's not an accident, Alan.\\
38 - Come on. Please, please, please?\\
39 - All right, all right. Save your begging for the date.\\
40 - I never beg.\\
41 - I grovel.\\
42 - Oh!\\
43 - I guess I'll have to find a baby-sitter for Jake.\\
44 - I don't need a baby-sitter. Nothing's going to happen to me.\\
45 - Who's worried about you? I'm worried about my house.\\
46 - It's $24.50.\\
47 - Whoa. Okay.\\
48 - Oh, geez!\\
49 - What?\\
50 - I walked out of the house without my wallet.\\
51 - Can you believe it?\\
52 - Strangely enough, I can.\\
53 - $24.50, please.\\
54 - Hang on. I know what happened.\\
55 - Because you drove, it didn't occur to me to pick up my wallet.\\
56 - The only reason I drove was because\\
57 - you said your car was low on gas.\\
58 - $24.50, please.\\
59 - Just a minute.\\
60 - You said you'd pay for parking,\\
61 - which now you won't be able to do\\
62 - because you forgot your wallet.\\
63 - Don't make a big deal of it.\\
64 - I'll pay for parking next time.\\
65 - That's what you said last time.\\
66 - Yes, but this time I forgot my wallet.\\
67 - CROWD: $24.50, please.\\
68 - Fine, I'll pay.\\
69 - Ooh, you know what?\\
70 - Why don't you throw in a bagel dog make it an even $30?\\
71 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
72 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
73 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
74 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
75 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
76 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
77 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
78 - Bye.\\
79 - I'm trusting you to act responsibly\\
80 - and go to bed at a reasonable hour.\\
81 - Okay.\\
82 - You know, this is a real turning point for you.\\
83 - You're taking care of yourself.\\
84 - You're becoming a man.\\
85 - You, too.\\
86 - Boy, it seems like only yesterday\\
87 - that I was bringing you home from the hospital.\\
88 - You were, you were like a little wrinkly pig with colic.\\
89 - Yeah. You going or not?\\
90 - You ready?\\
91 - Hang on.\\
92 - Good-bye, my son.\\
93 - Save it for the date, Dad.\\
94 - Don't burn the place down, and if you do,\\
95 - don't be here when I get back.\\
96 - He knows to drink the cheap Scotch,\\
97 - not the single malt, right?\\
98 - That's not funny.\\
99 - I'm not joking.\\
100 - He's probably just going to mix it\\
101 - with Hawaiian Punch anyway.\\
102 - * Men.\\
103 - Oh, God, I am so full.\\
104 - I don't think I could put another thing in my mouth.\\
105 - I'll bet just a figure of speech.\\
106 - This is such a beautiful restaurant.\\
107 - They don't have anything like this back home.\\
108 - Really? They don't have nice restaurants in Idaho?\\
109 - Oh, well, yeah, I mean\\
110 - we have a T.G.I. Fridays and an Applebee's.\\
111 - But you never see movie stars like we did here.\\
112 - Nina, they're just regular people.\\
113 - And technically, I wouldn't call Geraldo Rivera a movie star.\\
114 - Well, I thought it was very exciting.\\
115 - And since I'm only in town for the weekend,\\
116 - I think we should go absolutely crazy tonight.\\
117 - You two like to switch dates?\\
118 - Ooh, I'm up for that.\\
119 - No kidding?\\
120 - As long as we can switch back.\\
121 - Alan, I believe it's time we get the check.\\
122 - Agreed.\\
123 - Check, please.\\
124 - Be right back.\\
125 - Whoa, whoa, where are you going?\\
126 - To the little boys' room.\\
127 - He means the little cheap bastards' room.\\
128 - What's that, Charlie?\\
129 - Nothing.\\
130 - Excuse me.\\
131 - Back home we just call it "the crapper."\\
132 - I thought you had to pee.\\
133 - I did. I do.\\
134 - I am.\\
135 - Nice girls.\\
136 - Yeah, they're terrific. Mm.\\
137 - (sighing)\\
138 - No matter how you shake and dance,\\
139 - the last few drops fall on your pants.\\
140 - Maybe you shouldn't wear khakis.\\
141 - Uh-oh.\\
142 - What are you doing?\\
143 - What do you think I'm doing?\\
144 - Amazing.\\
145 - This might take a while, Charlie.\\
146 - All right, let's play.\\
147 - What, what are you doing?\\
148 - What do you think I'm doing?\\
149 - Okay.\\
150 - Hey, Alan?\\
151 - Yeah?\\
152 - This might take a while.\\
153 - MAN (on TV): Where's Jennifer?\\
154 - GIRL (on TV): She went into the caretaker's shack to look for Cory.\\
155 - Okay, you stay here. I'll go find her.\\
156 - No, I'm coming with you.\\
157 - Will you people quit going into the caretaker's shack?\\
158 - Cory, are you in here?\\
159 - No, you idiot, Cory's been dead for an hour.\\
160 - (woman screams)\\
161 - (cracking sound)\\
162 - Man, should have went to bed.\\
163 - (screams)\\
164 - Are you crazy?\\
165 - Well, there are several schools of thought on that.\\
166 - So, your dad let you stay by yourself tonight, huh?\\
167 - Why not? I'm old enough. I don't need a baby-sitter.\\
168 - Okay. Well, then I'll leave you to your movie.\\
169 - Wait, wait. You don't have to go.\\
170 - Want a Pop Tart?\\
171 - Sure, why not?\\
172 - So, what do I need to know?\\
173 - Well, basically when a guy has half a face,\\
174 - you leave him alone.\\
175 - Charlie, you still there?\\
176 - I told you it might take a while.\\
177 - Well, I guess this train isn't ready to leave the station.\\
178 - (toilets flush)\\
179 - You know what they say.\\
180 - Better to be on the toilet and not have to go\\
181 - then to have to go and not be on the toilet.\\
182 - Really? And who says that?\\
183 - I don't know. It's folk wisdom.\\
184 - Uh, the liquid soap is a nice idea\\
185 - for the house, don't you think?\\
186 - I guess.\\
187 - I mean, it makes sense when you think about it.\\
188 - You know, you wash your hands with a bar of soap,\\
189 - you're passing your germs on to the next guy, but, uh...\\
190 - with the liquid soap, it's not an issue.\\
191 - Good idea. Mmm.\\
192 - I'll tell Berta to pick up some liquid soap.\\
193 - Great, great.\\
194 - How funny is Berta?\\
195 - She is a pistol.\\
196 - Don't want to get athlete's hand.\\
197 - Another good idea for the house!\\
198 - Uh-oh.\\
199 - Don't even think about it.\\
200 - Where'd they go?\\
201 - Your lady friends left about 20 minutes ago.\\
202 - What? Why?\\
203 - They said something about life being too short.\\
204 - Are you happy?\\
205 - All right, just give me the check.\\
206 - Which you and I will split.\\
207 - Not necessary.\\
208 - Mr. Rivera took care of it before he left with the ladies.\\
209 - I guess they'll find out how "at large" he really is.\\
210 - Unbelievable.\\
211 - I know.\\
212 - We got a free dinner.\\
213 - * Men.\\
214 - (loud bumping on television)\\
215 - (man screaming)\\
216 - Boy, college students are really stupid.\\
217 - Yeah, if you shouldn't run with scissors,\\
218 - you definitely shouldn't run with hedge clippers.\\
219 - I can't believe I missed out on a sure thing\\
220 - 'cause I was sittin' on the can\\
221 - listening to you not take a crap.\\
222 - You're actually blaming me\\
223 - because I had to go to the bathroom?\\
224 - You didn't have to go to the bathroom.\\
225 - You were just trying to stick me with the check.\\
226 - Oh, oh, I see,\\
227 - so you know my bowels better than I do?\\
228 - I will when I pull them out through your nostrils.\\
229 - Well, I don't have to listen to this.\\
230 - What's your hurry? You see a check coming?\\
231 - What do you think?\\
232 - Should we watch the rest of the movie?\\
233 - Might as well.\\
234 - I'm not going to sleep tonight anyway.\\
235 - Leave me alone, Charlie.\\
236 - No, no, no, no, let's get this out in the open.\\
237 - There's nothing to get out in the open.\\
238 - I had to go to the bathroom,\\
239 - and even though I don't have as much money as you,\\
240 - I was fully prepared to split the check.\\
241 - Not quite 50-50 'cause, you know, you had the better wine\\
242 - and your date had two appetizers, but my fair share.\\
243 - What are you doing?\\
244 - What do you think?\\
245 - Alan, you can sit, but you can't hide.\\
246 - I am going to shower and get ready for bed.\\
247 - (shuts door) You're kidding.\\
248 - You're just going to walk away from me?\\
249 - Well, Charlie, when you're being irrational,\\
250 - you leave me no choice.\\
251 - I'm not being irrational.\\
252 - (water running)\\
253 - You want to see irrational?\\
254 - Here's irrational.\\
255 - (screams)\\
256 - My lamp.\\
257 - What the hell?\\
258 - I don't freakin' believe it.\\
259 - (water continues running)\\
260 - (doorbell rings)\\
261 - Charlie, the pizza's here!\\
262 - So it is.\\
263 - Hey, why don't I get this one?\\
264 - Hey, why don't you?\\
265 - What?\\
266 - No wallet?\\
267 - I'll be right back.\\
268 - I'll wait.\\
269 - Here you go, Mr. Harper. $22.75.\\
270 - Thanks, Gordon.\\
271 - Hang on.\\
272 - Keep the change.\\
273 - Wow, thanks.\\
274 - Oh, Gordon, wait, w-wait.\\
275 - You got to hear something.\\
276 - Hear what?\\
277 - Shh.\\
278 - Wait for it.\\
279 - (Alan shrieking)\\
280 - Was that it?\\
281 - Yep.\\
282 - Thanks for waiting.\\
283 - Looking for something?\\
284 - Yeah, my... wallet.\\
285 - Here it is.\\
286 - Oh, oh, thanks.\\
287 - Wow.\\
288 - The legendary lost wallet of Alan Harper.\\
289 - (chuckling): Funny.\\
290 - (imitates creaking)\\
291 - Oh, my.\\
292 - There's no money in here.\\
293 - No?\\
294 - No.\\
295 - How were you going to pay for the pizza, Alan?\\
296 - Uh, I-I have, um... uh...\\
297 - I have, um...\\
298 - What is it, Alan?\\
299 - What do you have?\\
300 - Nothing.\\
301 - You sure?\\
302 - Oh, where did you find that?\\
303 - I mean, what is that?\\
304 - About $5,000 in small bills.\\
305 - W-Wow, wow, that much?\\
306 - A little less, since I paid for the pizza.\\
307 - And tipped the guy a 50.\\
308 - You gave him a $50 tip?\\
309 - Yep.\\
310 - Now I'm going to go light my cigar with a hundred.\\
311 - Wait, wait, wait.\\
312 - Wait, wait, w-wait!\\
313 - I just remembered.\\
314 - I lost a big roll of bills\\
315 - that looked a lot like that one.\\
316 - Really?\\
317 - It's yours? I had no idea.\\
318 - An honest mistake. Gimme.\\
319 - You can understand my confusion.\\
320 - I mean, a guy has got this kind of cash laying around,\\
321 - you'd think he'd be able to pay for his own freakin' bagel dog.\\
322 - (sighs) You don't understand.\\
323 - The money isn't for me.\\
324 - Really?\\
325 - Who's it for?\\
326 - Old Alan.\\
327 - Old Alan?\\
328 - Yeah, you know, the Alan of the future.\\
329 - You're kidding.\\
330 - They're still going to have Alans in the future?\\
331 - No, see, the thing is...\\
332 - (sighs) I've been going through\\
333 - kind of a rough financial time since...\\
334 - well... high school.\\
335 - Anyway, it occurred to me\\
336 - that I could wind up an old man\\
337 - with no one to take care of me.\\
338 - I mean, who will Old Alan be able to count on?\\
339 - Certainly not Jake, 'cause let's face it,\\
340 - his best hope of a steady income is\\
341 - if missing the toilet becomes a professional sport.\\
342 - So, I decided that\\
343 - whenever somebody in the office paid in cash,\\
344 - I'd put it away for... Old Alan.\\
345 - What about the IRS?\\
346 - What about 'em? They don't care about Old Alan.\\
347 - Okay.\\
348 - Let me get this straight.\\
349 - You're squirreling away money for Old Alan\\
350 - while Young Alan sponges off of Dumb Charlie.\\
351 - I-I-I wouldn't call you dumb.\\
352 - Sweet Charlie, Loving Charlie.\\
353 - Can I have my money now?\\
354 - You have a serious problem, my friend.\\
355 - Yes, I do, no question.\\
356 - Now give me my money.\\
357 - You need help.\\
358 - I know, but who can afford it?\\
359 - All right.\\
360 - You know what I want you to do with this money?\\
361 - Oh, come on, man. I'm already constipated.\\
362 - You're gonna spend it.\\
363 - Every penny.\\
364 - But, but what about Old Alan?\\
365 - What will he do?\\
366 - Well, I'm guessing Old Alan will be living\\
367 - on Old Charlie's hide-a-bed until they bag him and tag him.\\
368 - Really? You mean, no matter what,\\
369 - I can always count on you?\\
370 - Keep the money.\\
371 - There you go.\\
372 - Enjoy your movie.\\
373 - Oh, hi, Charlie.\\
374 - Hey, bro.\\
375 - I'll take a big box of Milk Duds.\\
376 - Sure.\\
377 - That's $25.\\
378 - Anything for your lady friend?\\
379 - Nah, that's okay.\\
380 - She doesn't eat.\\
381 - Food.\\
382 - Keep the change.\\
383 - Oh, thanks, Charlie.\\
384 - I can always count on you.\\
385 - Come on, baby.\\
386 - Can you believe I'm older than him?\\
387 - Boy, that's some hot chick.\\
388 - Yeah.\\
389 - Don't eat the popcorn, Jake.\\
390 - Sorry, Dad.\\
391 - (shrieks)
\subsection {Episode 10: Kissing Abe Lincoln}
1 - So you understand the situation?\\
2 - I think so.\\
3 - Now that we're not married anymore,\\
4 - you want to sell my condo.\\
5 - No, no, it's, it's our condo.\\
6 - I got it for us.\\
7 - Not the smartest thing I ever did,\\
8 - but my real estate adviser was my penis.\\
9 - Is that what they mean\\
10 - when they say the market's gone soft?\\
11 - I don't think so.\\
12 - Look, my point is\\
13 - I can't afford to carry the mortgage\\
14 - on this place, but if we sell it,\\
15 - then we can split the profit.\\
16 - Or I could buy you out.\\
17 - Do you have money?\\
18 - I will after we sell.\\
19 - I am at the end of my rope.\\
20 - If can't get out from under these bills,\\
21 - I may well have to declare bankruptcy.\\
22 - Wow,\\
23 - that sounds really serious.\\
24 - It is deadly serious.\\
25 - Well, in that case...\\
26 - Want to have sex?\\
27 - What?\\
28 - I'm horny, you're stressed,\\
29 - seems like we both benefit.\\
30 - Well, I am really stressed.\\
31 - No, that's not going to solve anything!\\
32 - Okay.\\
33 - Well, I'm gonna go take a shower.\\
34 - Let me know if you change your mind.\\
35 - I changed my mind.\\
36 - (snorts)\\
37 - (groans)\\
38 - I either drank too much...\\
39 - or got hit by a train.\\
40 - Oh, God... train.\\
41 - Charlie.\\
42 - Oh, look,\\
43 - it's my sweet angel come to take me to heaven.\\
44 - Don't touch me.\\
45 - I hope you're proud of yourself.\\
46 - Well, I didn't wake up in my own vomit,\\
47 - so, yeah, kinda.\\
48 - You are such a child.\\
49 - Many people find that\\
50 - to be an endearing quality.\\
51 - I'm not one of them.\\
52 - It would appear not.\\
53 - We had fun last night, though, right?\\
54 - Oh, terrific.\\
55 - What woman doesn't enjoy pleasing a man\\
56 - who falls asleep while he's in the middle of reciprocating?\\
57 - That explains why I dreamt I was kissing Abe Lincoln.\\
58 - Okay, some underwear, no need to panic.\\
59 - And a little bit of makeup, no biggie.\\
60 - Running shoes, reading glasses, flannel nightgown\\
61 - and the latest issue of Modern Bride magazine.\\
62 - Red alert.\\
63 - Lydia? What?\\
64 - I couldn't help but notice that you put some of your stuff\\
65 - in one of my drawers.\\
66 - Yeah. Hey, you want to come in here\\
67 - and make up for last night?\\
68 - Well, yeah, but I think we should talk\\
69 - about this drawer thing.\\
70 - Okay,\\
71 - talk.\\
72 - Four score and seven years ago\\
73 - our fathers brought forth a upon this continent\\
74 - a new nation...\\
75 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
76 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
77 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
78 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
79 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
80 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
81 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
82 - Morning.\\
83 - That was a great job.\\
84 - Yeah, you know it's good when you feel dirtier\\
85 - coming out than you did going in.\\
86 - So what are you doing?\\
87 - Just practicing.\\
88 - For what?\\
89 - Nothing in particular.\\
90 - Just keeping sharp for my work.\\
91 - Oh, yeah, your little jingle thing.\\
92 - Hard to believe that takes practice.\\
93 - Berta, I'd like some scrambled egg whites,\\
94 - dry wheat toast and Earl Grey tea.\\
95 - Oh, yeah? well, I'd like some new shoes\\
96 - a jet pack and a waistline.\\
97 - You really thought she was going\\
98 - to make you breakfast?\\
99 - Yo, bro.\\
100 - Hey.\\
101 - How'd it go with Kandi?\\
102 - (chuckling): Great, just great.\\
103 - Turns out we can be friends with benefits.\\
104 - Ooh, nice. Did she agree to sell the condo?\\
105 - What?\\
106 - Isn't that why\\
107 - you went over there in the first place?\\
108 - Oh, yeah.\\
109 - Son of a bitch!\\
110 - Charlie,\\
111 - you need to talk to your maid.\\
112 - Shh-shh-shh-shh! Keep your voice down.\\
113 - Yeah, we don't use the "M" word around here.\\
114 - Why not?\\
115 - Because it's disrespectful.\\
116 - And demeaning.\\
117 - And wildly inaccurate.\\
118 - The point is, Berta's the one who keeps this house running,\\
119 - and more important, she's kinda like family.\\
120 - She's rude, offensive and vulgar.\\
121 - Okay, exactly like family.\\
122 - Fine.\\
123 - See if she'll do that thing with the ice cubes\\
124 - and the silk handkerchief you like so much.\\
125 - Come on, sweetie, don't be like that.\\
126 - Ice cubes and a silk handkerchief?\\
127 - You can also use a Popsicle and a necktie.\\
128 - But I do owe you a silk handkerchief.\\
129 - And your Water Pik's kinda iffy.\\
130 - And whatever you do,\\
131 - don't lick your hairbrush.\\
132 - * Men.\\
133 - I'm sorry to come over here and bother you again,\\
134 - but we never finished talking about selling the condo.\\
135 - But I don't want to sell the condo.\\
136 - I can see boats from here.\\
137 - I understand, but I can't afford the payments.\\
138 - I like boats.\\
139 - All right, well, if you won't...\\
140 - you won't cooperate, I'll just have\\
141 - to call my lawyer.\\
142 - What are you doing?\\
143 - Chester lost his bone. I'm looking for it.\\
144 - Now? Can't it wait?\\
145 - No, when Chester wakes up from his nap,\\
146 - he's gonna want his bone.\\
147 - You can keep talking.\\
148 - Okay, well, as I said,\\
149 - if you won't be reasonable, I'll just have to...\\
150 - to..\\
151 - Have to what, Alan?\\
152 - Son of a bitch!\\
153 - * Men.\\
154 - (gasps)\\
155 - What the...?!\\
156 - We need to talk.\\
157 - Okay.\\
158 - I don't mind your girlfriends throwing the occasional thong\\
159 - or panties into the hamper.\\
160 - I just boil 'em and sell 'em at the swap meet,\\
161 - but this broad is taking advantage\\
162 - of my easygoing nature.\\
163 - Now, to be fair,\\
164 - Lydia does have her positive attributes.\\
165 - Yeah, well, I ain't hitting any of them attributes\\
166 - so I don't give a rat's ass.\\
167 - All right, all right.\\
168 - You know what she said to me, Charlie?\\
169 - She said I need to learn my place around here.\\
170 - Oh, she didn't.\\
171 - Ah, but she did.\\
172 - Is that true, Charlie?\\
173 - Do I need to learn my place around here?\\
174 - No, Berta, we all know our place.\\
175 - And where is that place, Charlie?\\
176 - Wherever you want it to be.\\
177 - There's only room\\
178 - for one alpha dog in this house. I know.\\
179 - And who is that alpha dog, Charlie?\\
180 - You are. Say it. You're the alpha dog.\\
181 - Aw, you sweet talker you.\\
182 - We'll just pretend that's morning wood.\\
183 - * Men.\\
184 - Hi, how's it going?\\
185 - Well, look who's finally up.\\
186 - I need some lotion on my back.\\
187 - Oh, sure.\\
188 - Listen, I have to talk to you about Berta.\\
189 - For God's sake, Charlie, grow a pair.\\
190 - Is this your house or hers?\\
191 - Well, my name's on the deed, but she was here first.\\
192 - Thing is, over the years\\
193 - Berta and I have developed\\
194 - a really nice working relationship.\\
195 - Do my thighs.\\
196 - Right.\\
197 - And the key to a happy home, I find,\\
198 - is to not rock the boat.\\
199 - Not tamper with that balance.\\
200 - So you really need to make the effort...\\
201 - Where is she now?\\
202 - Huh? Oh, she went shopping.\\
203 - Anybody else around?\\
204 - No. Anyway, the thing with Berta...\\
205 - Why don't you put some sunscreen on your cute little bottom?\\
206 - What for?\\
207 - 'Cause I wouldn't want you to get a nasty burn.\\
208 - Why would I get a nasty...?\\
209 - Oh, we have sex.\\
210 - Good thing you're pretty 'cause you're very slow.\\
211 - * Men\\
212 - (mimics Lydia): Grow a pair, Charlie.\\
213 - Hey, Alan, come here.\\
214 - What's going on?\\
215 - I'm doing Lydia's laundry.\\
216 - Can I throw in my handkerchief?\\
217 - It wouldn't help.\\
218 - You'll probably have to burn it.\\
219 - Okay. And why are you doing Lydia's laundry?\\
220 - 'Cause Berta won't.\\
221 - Then why doesn't Lydia do it herself?\\
222 - 'Cause I told her I'd get Berta to do it.\\
223 - Aha. And do you have any idea how to do laundry?\\
224 - Oh, come on. You wash 'em, you dry 'em.\\
225 - How tough could it be?\\
226 - So what do you need me for?\\
227 - Which one's the washer?\\
228 - That one.\\
229 - Thanks.\\
230 - Just kidding. It's that one.\\
231 - Sorry. It was the first one.\\
232 - Look, it says "Wash" on the dial.\\
233 - Okay, okay, I can do this.\\
234 - I just turn it on and stick 'em in.\\
235 - It's a washing machine, not a cocktail waitress.\\
236 - Let's start by separating the delicates.\\
237 - How is that not like a cocktail waitress?\\
238 - The reason you need to do these separately\\
239 - is they're mostly synthetic.\\
240 - Add a beat-up Civic and an ex-husband\\
241 - and we're back to cocktail waitress.\\
242 - Charming. Hand me the detergent.\\
243 - This stuff here?\\
244 - No, no, that's fabric softener.\\
245 - You put that in after the first rinse cycle.\\
246 - You know what? Maybe I'll just buy her some new clothes.\\
247 - Don't be such a baby.\\
248 - Detergent.\\
249 - See?\\
250 - Here we go.\\
251 - Cold wash.\\
252 - Cold rinse.\\
253 - Gentle cycle.\\
254 - Done.\\
255 - (water running)\\
256 - What's that?\\
257 - That would be water entering the washing machine.\\
258 - Amazing. Mmm.\\
259 - Yeah, it's pretty cutting edge.\\
260 - (water flow stops)\\
261 - Did I break it?\\
262 - Close the lid.\\
263 - (water running)\\
264 - Well, son of a gun.\\
265 - (water flow stops)\\
266 - (water running)\\
267 - (water stops)\\
268 - (water running)\\
269 - what will they think of next?\\
270 - Yeah, I hear scientists are working on a machine\\
271 - that can cook two pieces of bread at the same time.\\
272 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, very funny.\\
273 - Now what?\\
274 - We wait.\\
275 - How will we know when they're done?\\
276 - Don't worry, the machine'll call you on your cell phone.\\
277 - Really?\\
278 - I don't know what Berta is always complaining about.\\
279 - This is kinda fun.\\
280 - Yeah, well, you're dealing with pretty-girl underwear.\\
281 - Berta has gotta handle Jake's skivvies\\
282 - after P.E. and pudding pops.\\
283 - Good point.\\
284 - What are you doing?\\
285 - Pouring a glass of vodka.\\
286 - Is that part of "doing the laundry"?\\
287 - 'Cause I could really get into this.\\
288 - No, I'm just mad at myself.\\
289 - Well, in that case, pour me one.\\
290 - I'm mad at you, too.\\
291 - So what's the problem?\\
292 - I went over to Kandi's again.\\
293 - And how'd that go?\\
294 - Not only are we not selling the condo,\\
295 - I may have promised to buy her a new fridge.\\
296 - Oh, Alan.\\
297 - She likes getting ice without having to open the door.\\
298 - You poor, whipped sap.\\
299 - Me? What about you?\\
300 - What about me?\\
301 - Charlie, you're doing a woman's laundry.\\
302 - No, no, no. No. See,\\
303 - that's just me trying to pitch in.\\
304 - Oh, just face it. Lydia's got you\\
305 - wrapped around her little finger.\\
306 - She does not.\\
307 - She uses this one.\\
308 - And it's not so much wrapped as... skewered.\\
309 - Who's using my washing machine?\\
310 - Excuse me, but it's my washing machine,\\
311 - and I'm using it to wash Lydia's clothes.\\
312 - You're doing laundry?\\
313 - Hey, it's not rocket science.\\
314 - Cold wash, cold rinse, gentle cycle,\\
315 - but first, you separate the delicates.\\
316 - Is that so?\\
317 - Yeah, that's so.\\
318 - (phone rings)\\
319 - That's probably them now.\\
320 - Hello.\\
321 - Oh, hey, Mom.\\
322 - I thought you were my washing machine.\\
323 - * Men.\\
324 - Rodney Cerman's the lone setback.\\
325 - Fox straight back again. He's got...\\
326 - Oh, come on-- throw the ball.\\
327 - Throw the ball!\\
328 - Or... fall down.\\
329 - Charlie, I'm leaving.\\
330 - Bye.\\
331 - I'd like a kiss.\\
332 - She's still there, isn't she?\\
333 - Yep.\\
334 - Just kidding, sweetie.\\
335 - That's better.\\
336 - Good-bye, Jake.\\
337 - I'm not kissing you.\\
338 - Oh, Charlie, I almost forgot.\\
339 - I'm serving hors d'oeuvres at an open house tomorrow,\\
340 - so I'll need to borrow Berta for a couple of hours.\\
341 - Say what?\\
342 - I'm talking to Charlie.\\
343 - You don't mind, do you?\\
344 - Mind? Well, I, uh...\\
345 - You want to borrow me?\\
346 - What am I, a carpet steamer?\\
347 - I'm not saying I won't pay you.\\
348 - Plus, you can take home all the leftovers.\\
349 - Oh, gee, why don't you just toss them all in a big bowl,\\
350 - and I'll eat them out in the yard?\\
351 - Well, that's a little uncalled for.\\
352 - I thought I was doing you a favor.\\
353 - You want to do me a favor, you take the money\\
354 - that you were going to pay me,\\
355 - convert it into rolls of nickels,\\
356 - then bend over and... Berta!\\
357 - Berta! Berta.\\
358 - Well, I don't have to stand here and listen to this.\\
359 - Charlie, you have to make a decision.\\
360 - It's her... or me.\\
361 - The skank's right, Charlie.\\
362 - It's her or me.\\
363 - Great.\\
364 - That's just great.\\
365 - Did somebody say there was a big bowl of food?\\
366 - * Men.\\
367 - You got an offer on the condo?\\
368 - Oh. Oh, Mom, you're a lifesaver.\\
369 - I don't care. I fully expect to take a loss.\\
370 - At least I don't have to pay you a commission.\\
371 - Oh, come on, you're my mother.\\
372 - Wait, wait, hang on, Mom, I've got another call coming in.\\
373 - Hello.\\
374 - Oh, oh, Kandi, Kandi, hello.\\
375 - Yeah, listen. Um, about the condo.\\
376 - My mom just got a very reasonable offer and...\\
377 - I give up. What are you wearing?\\
378 - Hang on.\\
379 - Mom, I gotta go.\\
380 - Kandi, I'll be right there.\\
381 - (whispers): Hey.\\
382 - Is Berta here?\\
383 - I haven't seen her.\\
384 - Great.\\
385 - I have to admit, Charlie, I never thought you'd have\\
386 - the cojones to fire Berta.\\
387 - Are you kidding?\\
388 - I've got huge cojones.\\
389 - Why do you think I'm wearing these baggy shorts?\\
390 - Wait. Wait, wait, wait.\\
391 - Wait, you fired Berta?\\
392 - Yes, Alan.\\
393 - She didn't know her place and she had to go.\\
394 - But we can't live without Berta.\\
395 - I'll be right there, sweetie.\\
396 - Hurry.\\
397 - You know what?\\
398 - We need to work on our communication skills.\\
399 - You know, I always thought that, but I didn't think\\
400 - you'd be open to... No, no, no, you jackass.\\
401 - God, you play along like a monkey with a mandolin.\\
402 - You mean you didn't fire Berta?\\
403 - That's it. Give me the mandolin.\\
404 - But you promised Berta you'd get rid of Lydia.\\
405 - Alan, do you know what this is?\\
406 - No. Then shut your stupid mouth.\\
407 - And don't tell Berta she was here.\\
408 - Fine. Just give me a heads up when you're lying.\\
409 - I'm always lying.\\
410 - I'll give you a heads up when I'm not.\\
411 - Yeah, you're the smart one.\\
412 - Know how I know?\\
413 - The washing machine called and told me.\\
414 - Ooh! High heels and Cool Whip.\\
415 - (toilet flushing)\\
416 - Oh, Charlie, how could you?\\
417 - Berta, this is not what it looks like.\\
418 - Charlie, you lied to me.\\
419 - Lydia, this is not what it looks like.\\
420 - That's it. I'm outta here.\\
421 - Me, too.\\
422 - Berta. Lydia. Oh, come on, wait!\\
423 - This is not what it looks like!\\
424 - (doors slam)\\
425 - Say it a few more times, Charlie.\\
426 - Maybe somebody will believe you.\\
427 - Berta. Berta, Berta, Berta.\\
428 - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You can't quit.\\
429 - Why not? Because we're family.\\
430 - We love each other.\\
431 - We forgive each other our shortcomings.\\
432 - Oh, bite me.\\
433 - Don't go, don't go.\\
434 - I promise I'll break it off with her.\\
435 - No, you won't. And you want to know why?\\
436 - 'Cause you are addicted to this broad.\\
437 - Oh, that's ridiculous.\\
438 - I can stop anytime I want.\\
439 - No, you can't. You're a nookie junkie,\\
440 - and I just can't trust you anymore.\\
441 - No, no, no, no, no, wait.\\
442 - Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
443 - You're right.\\
444 - I am addicted.\\
445 - I've got a vagina on my back, but I know I can get it off.\\
446 - I mean... you've got to help me.\\
447 - I can't help you, pal.\\
448 - You've got to help yourself.\\
449 - Good-bye, Charlie.\\
450 - Oh, come on, Berta, don't go.\\
451 - I'll do anything!\\
452 - I'm leaving now.\\
453 - You don't have to!\\
454 - I just fired her.\\
455 - Good-bye, Charlie.\\
456 - Oh, come on, Lydia, don't go.\\
457 - I'll do anything!\\
458 - You know what?\\
459 - I don't need either one of you.\\
460 - I can do my own laundry and I've got my own finger.\\
461 - * Men.\\
462 - I don't like it here.\\
463 - Well, tough.\\
464 - This is the only way I can get Berta to come back.\\
465 - But why do I have to be here?\\
466 - 'Cause it's the only way you're ever gonna sell your condo.\\
467 - Okay, let's get started.\\
468 - Welcome to our regular Monday night meeting.\\
469 - Do we have any newcomers?\\
470 - My name is Charlie and, uh...\\
471 - my maid says I'm a sex addict.\\

28 - Oh, right, the other part of Christmas.\\
29 - Go ahead, open it.\\
30 - Hold on. Let me give you your gift first.\\
31 - Don't want you think I forgot you.\\
32 - A hundred bucks? Wow!\\
33 - Picked it out myself.\\
34 - Now open yours.\\
35 - Okay.\\
36 - This is kind of exciting.\\
37 - "Fart in a Can"?\\
38 - You don't have one, do you?\\
39 - Well, I've got you.\\
40 - But this is good for travel.\\
41 - Jake, I just talked to your mom.\\
42 - She's going to be here any minute.\\
43 - Don't look at Uncle Charlie's gift.\\
44 - You're getting the same thing.\\
45 - Oh, boy, I'm excited.\\
46 - Don't be.\\
47 - Speaking of gifts...\\
48 - Merry Christmas.\\
49 - I'll leave it up to you.\\
50 - You can open it tomorrow morning at your mom's, or...\\
51 - you can rip it open with your teeth like a rabid jackal.\\
52 - You got me the new Nintendo?!\\
53 - It's from Uncle Charlie, too.\\
54 - You owe me $125.\\
55 - But I just...\\
56 - This is so cool! Thanks, Dad!\\
57 - Thanks, Uncle Charlie!\\
58 - Yeah, yeah, merry Christmas.\\
59 - I'm going to go hook it up.\\
60 - No, no, no, you're leaving.\\
61 - Your Uncle Charlie's hooking up.\\
62 - You're leaving too, right?\\
63 - Yes, relax.\\
64 - I plan on spending Christmas Eve\\
65 - at a movie theater all by myself\\
66 - just so you can have sex tonight.\\
67 - You can have sex, too.\\
68 - Just pick the right movie theater.\\
69 - (doorbell ringing)\\
70 - Jake, time to go.\\
71 - Take some paper towels and don't wear your suede shoes.\\
72 - Ho, ho, ho.\\
73 - That's another option.\\
74 - BOTH: Merry Christmas.\\
75 - Merry Christmas. Come on in.\\
76 - Hey, merry Christmas, Charlie.\\
77 - Yes, swell. I'll go get the kid.\\
78 - Ooh, eggnog.\\
79 - Honey, we've got a long drive ahead of us.\\
80 - We're spending the holidays in San Diego with my parents.\\
81 - That's why I need eggnog.\\
82 - Hey, I spent Thanksgiving with your parents.\\
83 - Oh, really? Your mom's out of rehab?\\
84 - Yes, my mom's out of rehab.\\
85 - Actually, she kind of jumped the fence.\\
86 - Well, the woman's going to be your mother-in-law--\\
87 - you might as well get used to it.\\
88 - Remember the time she rode out of Betty Ford on a lawnmower?\\
89 - On the plus side, she bakes Toll House cookies\\
90 - with walnuts and Demerol.\\
91 - Stuff never goes back in the box the way it came out.\\
92 - It's a life lesson, Jake.\\
93 - Come on, your mom's here.\\
94 - Vamoose.\\
95 - Okay, table's set on the deck\\
96 - and dinner's in the oven. Great.\\
97 - You might want to keep the candles away from the eggnog.\\
98 - Got it.\\
99 - All right then, I'm leaving now.\\
100 - Good-bye and thanks.\\
101 - Yeah, merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.\\
102 - All the best. Same to you.\\
103 - Give me my bonus, you blockhead.\\
104 - Oh, right.\\
105 - Thank you for all your hard work.\\
106 - Couldn't get along without you.\\
107 - You're one in a million.\\
108 - Really?\\
109 - What would Jesus do?\\
110 - Herb?\\
111 - Oh, no thanks. I'm driving.\\
112 - I'll have some.\\
113 - No, you won't. It's for grownups.\\
114 - I'll have another.\\
115 - Sweetie, my parents are waiting.\\
116 - I know, dear.\\
117 - Apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it?\\
118 - Okay, merry Christmas to all,\\
119 - and to all, a good-bye.\\
120 - Hang on.\\
121 - I've got a long bus ride,\\
122 - and I don't want to sober up halfway home.\\
123 - KANDI: Hello?\\
124 - Kandi?\\
125 - What are you doing here?\\
126 - I didn't want to be alone on Christmas Eve\\
127 - and I didn't know where else to go.\\
128 - Where's your new boyfriend?\\
129 - He decided to spend Christmas with his family.\\
130 - Why didn't he bring you along?\\
131 - He thought it would make his wife uncomfortable.\\
132 - Oh. Sweetie, come on in.\\
133 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
134 - I've got company coming, remember?\\
135 - I can't just throw her out, Charlie.\\
136 - How do you know if you don't try?\\
137 - Lighten up, it's Christmas.\\
138 - Okay, two minutes, and then I bring out the Fart in a Can.\\
139 - ALAN: You remember Judith. Hi, Judith.\\
140 - And this is her fianc  , Herb.\\
141 - Hi, Herb. Hi.\\
142 - ALAN: Here, let me take your coat.\\
143 - Oh, my golly.\\
144 - Well, I guess we should get going.\\
145 - What's the hurry?\\
146 - Your parents are waiting, remember?\\
147 - What do you care? They don't like you anyway.\\
148 - Eggnog?\\
149 - Thank you.\\
150 - You're welcome.\\
151 - I'm a doctor.\\
152 - A real one or like Alan?\\
153 - I'm a pediatrician.\\
154 - Wow, so you're into feet.\\
155 - No, children.\\
156 - Isn't that illegal?\\
157 - Berta, don't you have a bus to catch?\\
158 - And miss this show? Are you nuts?\\
159 - Feliz Navidad, everyone!\\
160 - Ooh, I didn't see that one coming.\\
161 - Mom, what are you doing here?\\
162 - I was on my way to a party,\\
163 - thought I'd drop off your gifts\\
164 - so that I don't have to schlep back here tomorrow\\
165 - and mess up my day.\\
166 - ROSE: Charlie?\\
167 - Rose?!\\
168 - How could you have a Christmas party and not invite me?\\
169 - This isn't a Christmas party.\\
170 - Well, what do you call it?\\
171 - The beginning of a news story\\
172 - that ends with the phrase,\\
173 - "He then turned the gun on himself.\\
174 - All right, all right, everybody listen up.\\
175 - Listen to me.\\
176 - There is no party.\\
177 - You all have to leave now because a beautiful woman\\
178 - is coming over and I intend to get her drunk\\
179 - and have sex with her.\\
180 - WOMAN: That's a good plan.\\
181 - Except I'm already drunk.\\
182 - Boy, I can't wait till the second act.\\
183 - * Men...\\
184 - More fuel for the fire.\\
185 - You said you were going home.\\
186 - Well, that was before I knew you were having a party.\\
187 - This isn't a party.\\
188 - It's just a bunch of people I don't like\\
189 - standing around drinking my booze.\\
190 - Oh, crap, it is a party.\\
191 - Give me that.\\
192 - Love to know that those two are talking about.\\
193 - I could tell you.\\
194 - I read lips.\\
195 - Really? Yep.\\
196 - Right now your date\\
197 - is saying\\
198 - "The wily ostrich sank my boat."\\
199 - I have a little congestion in my upper chest.\\
200 - Can you take a look at it?\\
201 - Oh, well, I could...\\
202 - Kandi, he's a pediatrician. He only treats children.\\
203 - Now hold on.\\
204 - There's no actual age limit.\\
205 - I took an oath to ease suffering wherever I find it.\\
206 - Alan, a word.\\
207 - Oh, good... a word.\\
208 - I don't have my stethoscope,\\
209 - so why don't you just breathe in and out for me.\\
210 - Make this stop.\\
211 - I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about.\\
212 - Don't screw with me.\\
213 - Tell your ex-wife to stop flirting with my fianc  .\\
214 - Gee, that's funny.\\
215 - The way I see it,\\
216 - your peanut butter is all over my chocolate.\\
217 - Damn it, Alan, I can make your life a living hell.\\
218 - How would I know the difference?\\
219 - Cough again.\\
220 - Once more.\\
221 - Let's have a little pow-wow.\\
222 - She might have a touch of the croup.\\
223 - Listen, Herb... So you were married to her?\\
224 - Yes, we were married.\\
225 - Judith is getting really upset with you.\\
226 - So you got to see her naked?\\
227 - Stay with me, Herb.\\
228 - Your fianc  e is very angry.\\
229 - Really? How come?\\
230 - Oh, I don't know, maybe it's because\\
231 - you were trying use Kandi's nipple as a Q-tip.\\
232 - It's okay, I'm a doctor.\\
233 - Just do yourself a favor--\\
234 - go pay attention to Judith.\\
235 - All right.\\
236 - Some party, huh?\\
237 - Yeah, I'm glad I didn't waste this buzz on the bus.\\
238 - Here comes your mom.\\
239 - Act like you didn't know what they were saying.\\
240 - Charlie, I must talk to you.\\
241 - I know. Why is that?\\
242 - How serious is your relationship with Gloria?\\
243 - Not that it's any of your business,\\
244 - but this is our second date.\\
245 - What happened on the first date?\\
246 - They went out to dinner, he took her home\\
247 - and they made out a little bit in the car.\\
248 - Oh, I'm sorry, did you want to tell it?\\
249 - So, you haven't slept together?\\
250 - Not yet.\\
251 - Oops. There I go again.\\
252 - That's good. Uh, darling,\\
253 - you need to end this relationship now.\\
254 - Why?\\
255 - Do you trust me?\\
256 - ALL: No.\\
257 - Okay, but you know I have\\
258 - your best interests at heart, don't you?\\
259 - ALL: No.\\
260 - All right, then, let me put it this way.\\
261 - I forbid you to see this woman any more.\\
262 - You forbid?\\
263 - What gives you the right to forbid?\\
264 - I'm 39 years old.\\
265 - I'm your mother. You're 40.\\
266 - And you must not see this woman anymore!\\
267 - Mom, you know that just makes me want her more.\\
268 - Charlie, I mean it.\\
269 - I'm getting hotter.\\
270 - Look, I know certain things about Gloria's past\\
271 - which are, well, unsavory.\\
272 - Okay, I'm going supernova.\\
273 - Would you listen to me?\\
274 - If you continue to see this woman,\\
275 - it will hurt me, deeply.\\
276 - I may have to marry this girl.\\
277 - Okay. Okay.\\
278 - You give me no choice.\\
279 - Who are you calling?\\
280 - It's probably about the ostrich in the boat.\\
281 - Charlie, I'm getting pretty drunk,\\
282 - so if you like a girl who moves, you better do me soon.\\
283 - Follow me.\\
284 - Ah... isn't that sweet?\\
285 - Every time a guy has sex, an angel gets a stiffy.\\
286 - Would you look at them?\\
287 - Oh, I completely forgot about the subplot.\\
288 - What do you want me to do, Judith?\\
289 - He's your man. You want him? Fight for him.\\
290 - How can I compete with that?\\
291 - There's no competition.\\
292 - Herb loves you.\\
293 - You have a mature, sophisticated relationship\\
294 - based on mutual respect.\\
295 - All Kandi has is...\\
296 - There'll be other men.\\
297 - Just get here as soon as you can.\\
298 - Where's Charlie?\\
299 - Damn it!\\
300 - Oh, I get it.\\
301 - It's like Tony and Tina's Wedding.\\
302 - You gotta follow them around.\\
303 - Hey. Mommio. Daddio.\\
304 - Hi, buddy.\\
305 - Mommio. Daddio, Daddio.\\
306 - Mommio, Mommio. Daddio...\\
307 - Stop!\\
308 - Mom!\\
309 - Get out of that bed this instant!\\
310 - I don't think that's a good idea.\\
311 - Charlie, I'm warning you.\\
312 - You can't tell him what to do-- he's 34 years old.\\
313 - He's what?\\
314 - She's drunk.\\
315 - Mom, what are you doing here?\\
316 - I'm trying to keep you from making a horrible mistake.\\
317 - What do you care?\\
318 - I make this mistake on a regular basis.\\
319 - Some might call it a lifestyle.\\
320 - Charlie... I don't want to hear it.\\
321 - I came up here to do a job.\\
322 - Actually, two jobs and a chore.\\
323 - Now, you can stay and watch,\\
324 - which I don't recommend, or you can leave.\\
325 - Either way, Gloria and I are going to have sex.\\
326 - Go ahead.\\
327 - Okay, I'm bluffing.\\
328 - He sure is.\\
329 - (playing "Heart and Soul")\\
330 - * Jingle bells, jingle bells\\
331 - * Jingle all the way\\
332 - * Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh *\\
333 - * Jingle bells, jingle bells... *\\
334 - Have you seen Jake? Nope.\\
335 - Huh.\\
336 - Jake?\\
337 - HERB: Whoa, whoa, whoa!\\
338 - Judith! What the hell are you doing?\\
339 - You told me to fight for my man.\\
340 - I'm fighting for my man.\\
341 - HERB: Alan, would you please close the door?\\
342 - Sorry.\\
343 - 12 years of marriage, she never fought for me from that angle.\\
344 - (Kandi playing same tune)\\
345 - * Silent night\\
346 - * Holy night...\\
347 - Kandi? Yeah?\\
348 - Take a break. Okey-doke.\\
349 - (doorbell rings)\\
350 - Hello.\\
351 - Oh, my goodness.\\
352 - Are you Alan?\\
353 - Uh, yes.\\
354 - I haven't seen you in 35 years.\\
355 - No kidding. I'm sorry, I don't remember you.\\
356 - Well, I'm not surprised.\\
357 - At the time you were busy\\
358 - learning to use the big-boy potty.\\
359 - Ah. Well.\\
360 - I did it.\\
361 - Good job.\\
362 - Uh, listen, Alan, I'm looking for my daughter.\\
363 - Drunk blonde?\\
364 - Well, she isn't always blonde.\\
365 - Upstairs.\\
366 - Thank you.\\
367 - You know,\\
368 - you turned out to be a very attractive man.\\
369 - Um, thank you.\\
370 - Coulda gone either way.\\
371 - Lucky you grew into those ears.\\
372 - (playing same tune)\\
373 - * Frosty the Snowman\\
374 - * Was a very jolly soul\\
375 - * With a corncob pipe and a button nose *\\
376 - * And two eyes made out of coal... *\\
377 - Damn it, Charlie, you don't know what\\
378 - you're getting into here.\\
379 - Oh, I think I have a pretty good idea.\\
380 - I mean, what could you possibly tell me about Gloria\\
381 - that would get me to kick her out of bed?\\
382 - She's married? Clinically insane? She's a man?\\
383 - You're not a man, are you? Nope.\\
384 - Then we're good.\\
385 - Gloria, get out of that bed.\\
386 - Mom?\\
387 - "Mom"?\\
388 - Well, did you tell them?\\
389 - I tried, but I couldn't. Why not?\\
390 - What do you mean, why not? Why do you think?\\
391 - Oh, so, as usual, I have to do your dirty work.\\
392 - You can't sleep with him\\
393 - because he might be your brother.\\
394 - There, was that so hard?\\
395 - It's certainly not hard for someone who has no shame.\\
396 - Says the woman who killed my husband.\\
397 - I did not kill Sherman.\\
398 - I made Sherman happy.\\
399 - Excuse me, excuse me. Hold on. Hold on.\\
400 - Can we go back to the part where I may be her brother?\\
401 - Oh, dear Lord, has the blood\\
402 - not returned to your brain yet?\\
403 - It was the '70s.\\
404 - We were young, attractive couples\\
405 - and there was a gas shortage\\
406 - so we had to "entertain" at home.\\
407 - Wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
408 - Are you saying you and her husband...?\\
409 - Yes, and she and your father.\\
410 - Blame OPEC.\\
411 - It started with a weekly fondue party,\\
412 - but one night the dipping didn't stop at cheese.\\
413 - Unfortunately, some of us couldn't handle it.\\
414 - You did unspeakable things with Sherman\\
415 - and then he wanted to do them with me.\\
416 - Oh, nonsense.\\
417 - I just raised the bar a bit.\\
418 - Raised the bar?\\
419 - Do you have any idea how many third-world countries\\
420 - that man visited trying to find someone else\\
421 - who would do those things?\\
422 - Oh, he didn't have to go abroad.\\
423 - He was just looking for a bargain.\\
424 - If it weren't for you\\
425 - he would never have contracted amoebic dysentery and died.\\
426 - I hate to interrupt, but I'm still trying\\
427 - to process the "I'm her brother" thing.\\
428 - Mmm.\\
429 - Not the shiniest penny in the roll, is he?\\
430 - All right.\\
431 - I guess I better spell it out for you.\\
432 - Based on the amount of time that elapsed\\
433 - between the last fondue party and Gloria's birth,\\
434 - and not to mention the fact that Sherman\\
435 - lost interest in traditional sex with me...\\
436 - Thank you very much.\\
437 - There is the very real possibility\\
438 - that your father may be her father.\\
439 - Oh, my God. Wow.\\
440 - So you can see why a tryst of this nature\\
441 - is completely unacceptable.\\
442 - It's not like we couldn't have foreseen this,\\
443 - given that your son has spent the bulk of his adult life\\
444 - humping his way through the greater Los Angeles area.\\
445 - Oh, and like this booze-addled tart is an innocent victim.\\
446 - Hey, I'm drunk, not deaf.\\
447 - Just get out of bed and get dressed.\\
448 - Well, that was humiliating.\\
449 - Just be glad we didn't have to tell them\\
450 - about our little experiment.\\
451 - EVELYN: Don't remind me.\\
452 - Oh, you loved it.\\
453 - Oh, a third-act twist.\\
454 - Wow.\\
455 - Yeah.\\
456 - I am so horny right now I can't believe it.\\
457 - Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
458 - Did you miss what just went down here... Sis?\\
459 - Oh, come on. It's not like we're gonna get married\\
460 - and have a bunch of web-footed kids..\\
461 - You have absolutely no boundaries, do you?\\
462 - Well... I don't like fat guys.\\
463 - Interesting.\\
464 - Turns out... I draw the line at incest.\\
465 - So you'd do a fat guy?\\
466 - Do you hear that?\\
467 - Charlie found his boundary.\\
468 - It's a miracle.\\
469 - A Christmas miracle.\\
470 - Judith, can I just say that this was the best Christmas ever.\\
471 - Yeah, well, don't get used to it.\\
472 - "'Twas the night before Christmas\\
473 - "And all through the house\\
474 - Not a creature was stirring..."\\
475 - (vomiting)\\
476 - Okay, just so we're clear.\\
477 - We are only doing this to piss off my mom?\\
478 - You have a problem with that?\\
479 - No, that makes it better.
\subsection {Episode 12: Castrating Sheep in Montana}
1 - I had a great dream last night.\\
2 - Really? Yeah.\\
3 - I dreamed I got locked in a house made of donuts\\
4 - and I had to eat my way out.\\
5 - Interesting.\\
6 - I had a similar dream, only no house and no donuts.\\
7 - Morning.\\
8 - Morning. Morning.\\
9 - So, uh...\\
10 - how'd everybody sleep?\\
11 - Uncle Charlie and I both had dreams about eating.\\
12 - Mine was with donuts. His was something dirty.\\
13 - He's just guessing.\\
14 - Good guess.\\
15 - And yes, Alan, we see your earring.\\
16 - It's pretty cool, right?\\
17 - Yeah, if you're going to a Wham! concert with Molly Ringwald.\\
18 - I think it's cool. Thank you, Jake.\\
19 - Can I get my ear pierced? No.\\
20 - Why not?\\
21 - You can't keep the holes you have clean.\\
22 - And you're too young.\\
23 - Wait till you're old, desperate,\\
24 - and living in your brother's house.\\
25 - You can mock me all you want,\\
26 - but there's a certain lady who thinks it's darn sexy.\\
27 - First of all, I don't need permission to mock you...\\
28 - but more importantly,\\
29 - you let some broad talk you into piercing your ear?\\
30 - Actually, my ear wasn't her first choice to pierce.\\
31 - What else can you pierce?\\
32 - Nothing. Nothing.\\
33 - Fine. Don't tell me.\\
34 - I'll Google it.\\
35 - Don't worry.\\
36 - He can't spell "pierce."\\
37 - He can't spell "Google."\\
38 - So, who's Princess Poke-a-Hole?\\
39 - Just a nice young woman with a sewing needle and a potato.\\
40 - A potato?\\
41 - Yeah, she, uh, she put it behind my lobe,\\
42 - sort of like a pincushion.\\
43 - Oh. So you're a moron.\\
44 - It's perfectly safe.\\
45 - She sterilized the needle.\\
46 - How?\\
47 - With alcohol.\\
48 - Okay, Kahlua.\\
49 - Well, I guess I owe morons an apology.\\
50 - You do know that's the gay ear.\\
51 - What?\\
52 - Left ear says "I'm a hipster from the disco era."\\
53 - Right ear says...\\
54 - (flamboyantly): "Let's disco!"\\
55 - No, no, th-th-that can't be right.\\
56 - Okay, don't believe me.\\
57 - Hey, look who's finally out of the closet.\\
58 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
59 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
60 - Berta.\\
61 - Yeah. What are you doing?\\
62 - Making your bed.\\
63 - Well, I'd like to take a nap.\\
64 - Hop in. You can spoon me, but it ends there.\\
65 - Are you sick?\\
66 - Yeah, I'm sick.\\
67 - I'm sick of staying up all night with a screaming baby\\
68 - while my daughter's out trolling the waterfront\\
69 - for the father of her next one.\\
70 - Whoa, that's rough.\\
71 - Oh, don't feign interest in my life, Charlie.\\
72 - Sorry, I, I, I see a woman in my bed,\\
73 - I instinctively start lying.\\
74 - Close the door on your way out.\\
75 - Okay.\\
76 - No.\\
77 - No, this is ridiculous.\\
78 - Berta. Get out.\\
79 - Sleep tight.\\
80 - (phone ringing)\\
81 - Hello? Ow!\\
82 - Uh, hello?\\
83 - Oh, oh, hi.\\
84 - Uh, no, no, it's, uh, it's just a little tender.\\
85 - I'm glad you called. I, I missed you, too.\\
86 - Yeah, yeah, last night was fun.\\
87 - (laughs)\\
88 - You won't believe who's in my bed.\\
89 - Hang on.\\
90 - I never do...\\
91 - but I'm on the phone right now.\\
92 - Ow!\\
93 - Ah... damn it.\\
94 - Uh, listen, how about tonight?\\
95 - Oh, great, great.\\
96 - The usual place?\\
97 - All right, well, see you then.\\
98 - (chuckles) Okay. B-Bye.\\
99 - Berta's in my bed.\\
100 - Really?\\
101 - Couldn't you just pay her in cash this week?\\
102 - (chuckling)\\
103 - Ow!\\
104 - There are some things we don't joke about.\\
105 - Okay, so...\\
106 - why is Berta in your bed?\\
107 - Apparently, her daughter's been out partying every night\\
108 - and Berta's been stuck with the baby.\\
109 - Oh, that's got to be rough.\\
110 - Don't feign interest in her life, Alan.\\
111 - Sorry.\\
112 - Oh, hey, hey, listen, can you watch Jake tonight?\\
113 - Why? You want to see if your new lady friend can infect\\
114 - other parts of your body?\\
115 - It's not infected.\\
116 - A certain amount of swelling is perfectly normal.\\
117 - Where'd it say that, Alan?\\
118 - On the potato?\\
119 - Are you at least going to tell me who this woman is?\\
120 - It's nobody you know.\\
121 - Oh... so I know her.\\
122 - I didn't say that.\\
123 - You didn't have to.\\
124 - Now let's see.\\
125 - Who do I know that you'd like to keep a secret?\\
126 - You're wasting your time.\\
127 - One of your ex-wives?\\
128 - (scoffs)\\
129 - Rose? Berta's daughter?\\
130 - (laughing): Berta's daughter?\\
131 - D-Don't be ridiculous.\\
132 - Ha... ha-ha.\\
133 - That's rich.\\
134 - Ha, ha, ha!\\
135 - * Men...\\
136 - I'm tired. Shouldn't I be in bed?\\
137 - Shut up and deal.\\
138 - Look, I'll give you back the money I won.\\
139 - You didn't win it till we stop playing.\\
140 - Now deal.\\
141 - What's he doing up?\\
142 - Not now, Alan.\\
143 - I'm all in.\\
144 - Jake, bed.\\
145 - Hold on, Dad. Call ya.\\
146 - Pocket aces.\\
147 - What do you got?\\
148 - You heard your father. Go to bed.\\
149 - He's been betting on garbage all night.\\
150 - You let a 12-year-old beat you at poker?\\
151 - He's 12 and a half.\\
152 - What's going on with your ear, Dumbo?\\
153 - It's just a little swelling.\\
154 - It's normal.\\
155 - Better pierce the other one.\\
156 - You don't want to be flying around in circles.\\
157 - It's fine.\\
158 - Listen, th-there's something I need to get off my chest.\\
159 - If you don't see a doctor soon,\\
160 - it'll be your earlobe.\\
161 - Are you going to listen or what? Sorry.\\
162 - I'm all ears. No, wait, that's you.\\
163 - You know what? Forget about it.\\
164 - No, no, no, no, come on. Talk to me. (sighs)\\
165 - It's about the girl I'm dating.\\
166 - Berta's daughter.\\
167 - How didyou know?\\
168 - Your idiot son doesn't have a single tell,\\
169 - but you I can read like a stop sign.\\
170 - Okay.\\
171 - I was going to build up to the big reveal, but I...\\
172 - Just cut to the chase.\\
173 - You remember how I had a little crush on Naomi\\
174 - when she was pregnant?\\
175 - A little crush?\\
176 - You were like a monkey trying to hump a watermelon.\\
177 - Are you going to let me tell the story?\\
178 - I'm just fact-checking.\\
179 - Go ahead.\\
180 - Anyway, after she had the baby, we stayed in touch,\\
181 - and I got to know her and the baby and...\\
182 - I'm starting to care about both of them.\\
183 - Aw, buddy, you got a heart as big as your ear.\\
184 - But you're falling into the same trap you always do.\\
185 - What's that?\\
186 - You're a pathological rescuer.\\
187 - Ever since you're a little kid,\\
188 - bringing home that stray three-legged cat.\\
189 - Oh, yeah, Tippy.\\
190 - And finding the sick baby bird...\\
191 - Mm. ...feeding it with an eyedropper,\\
192 - nursing it back to health.\\
193 - Until Tippy ate it.\\
194 - And it's the same thing with women.\\
195 - You constantly seek out these damaged, needy broads.\\
196 - You know, you're right.\\
197 - Maybe subconsciously I'm hoping\\
198 - that if I save them, they'll love me.\\
199 - Perhaps.\\
200 - Or subconsciously you realize the only way\\
201 - an emotionally healthy, self-supporting woman\\
202 - would pick you up is on a scavenger hunt.\\
203 - But... we digress.\\
204 - Please continue with your star-crossed love story.\\
205 - Well, Naomi and I have been sneaking around\\
206 - behind Berta's back\\
207 - and... I'm starting to feel guilty about it.\\
208 - You want my advice?\\
209 - Live with the guilt and see a doctor\\
210 - before that thing grows teeth.\\
211 - But don't you think the honorable thing\\
212 - would be to tell Berta?\\
213 - Sure, honorable's one way to go.\\
214 - But may I remind you that this is a woman who's been known\\
215 - to lift the stove with one hand\\
216 - in order to beat a mouse to death with the other.\\
217 - How much honor you think that little fella had?\\
218 - Oh... now you're just being silly.\\
219 - I mean, Berta's not going to physically assault me.\\
220 - I hope you're right.\\
221 - I've grown to enjoy these little talks.\\
222 - * Men...\\
223 - Why don't you just pay me what you owe me?\\
224 - I don't owe you till we're done.\\
225 - Now throw the dice.\\
226 - Oh, you just suck.\\
227 - I wouldn't need a job if I joined the Army.\\
228 - You can't join the Army. Why not?\\
229 - Because you already are all that you can be.\\
230 - You remember my little burden Naomi.\\
231 - Oh, sure, I remember her. Hi.\\
232 - She's got job interviews this afternoon.\\
233 - I'm gonna watch the baby.\\
234 - How are you going to work and watch the baby?\\
235 - Who said I was gonna work?\\
236 - CHARLIE: Hey, Alan.\\
237 - Look who's here.\\
238 - Oh. H-Hello. Hi.\\
239 - Um... Nancy, right?\\
240 - Uh, Naomi. Naomi. Naomi, sure.\\
241 - (chuckling): Been a long time.\\
242 - Sure has.\\
243 - And this must be your baby.\\
244 - Oh, isn't she cute?\\
245 - Oh, thanks.\\
246 - And there's the proud grandma.\\
247 - Look at her beaming.\\
248 - Well, dip me in butter and roll me in nuts.\\
249 - I, too, am shocked.\\
250 - So you're the sleazeball\\
251 - she's been running around with.\\
252 - Oh, Alan, how could you?\\
253 - I-It's my fault, Mom.\\
254 - Alan wanted to tell you.\\
255 - No, no, it's, it's my responsibility.\\
256 - If you're gonna do anything, do it to me.\\
257 - Welcome to the family.\\
258 - I made you breakfast.\\
259 - Really?\\
260 - Need to have your morning tinkle first?\\
261 - No, I'm okay.\\
262 - Good.\\
263 - I made all your favorites:\\
264 - scrambled egg whites, turkey bacon,\\
265 - rye toast no butter, decaf coffee.\\
266 - Well, thank you.\\
267 - You eat like a 90-year-old man with stomach cancer,\\
268 - but I don't judge.\\
269 - So...\\
270 - what do you and my little girl have planned for today?\\
271 - Maybe a romantic walk on the beach?\\
272 - A cozy picnic?\\
273 - I could pack you a lunch.\\
274 - Uh, gee, Berta, I don't...\\
275 - Or how about this?\\
276 - I'll watch the baby\\
277 - and you two can spend the afternoon in bed gettin' sticky.\\
278 - Ah, well, uh, as lovely as that sounds,\\
279 - I wasn't really planning on seeing Naomi today.\\
280 - Why not? What's wrong?\\
281 - Oh, please don't tell me there's something wrong.\\
282 - I mean, you ain't much, but you're the best she ever had.\\
283 - No, no, nothing's wrong.\\
284 - I just... I have to go to work today.\\
285 - Oh, right.\\
286 - Silly me.\\
287 - Naomi never dated anybody with a job before.\\
288 - At least not one that's indoors and legal.\\
289 - I understand.\\
290 - Well, you let me know if you need anything.\\
291 - I will.\\
292 - Ironing, groceries?\\
293 - I could lance that ear for you.\\
294 - Uh, no, thanks.\\
295 - I know what I'm doin'.\\
296 - I spent a summer castrating sheep in Montana.\\
297 - I'll keep that in mind.\\
298 - Uh, but I think it's fine.\\
299 - Okay.\\
300 - You made an old lady very happy, Alan.\\
301 - I'm...\\
302 - glad.\\
303 - Bye-bye now.\\
304 - Bye-bye.\\
305 - Oh, I am so screwed.\\
306 - Charlie?\\
307 - I'm in the bathroom, Alan.\\
308 - Um...\\
309 - I've got kind of a delicate problem.\\
310 - The antibiotics are in my dresser drawer.\\
311 - (toilet flushing) No, no, it's, it's Berta.\\
312 - She's being ridiculously nice to me\\
313 - and I'm afraid what might happen if I break up with her daughter.\\
314 - Oh, you can't break up with her daughter.\\
315 - Whaddya mean I can't break up with her?\\
316 - Well, I guess you could, but...\\
317 - So what am I supposed to do,\\
318 - marry Naomi just to keep Berta happy?\\
319 - You don't have to marry her.\\
320 - Just let the relationship follow its natural course.\\
321 - Natural course?\\
322 - Think about it, Alan.\\
323 - Any woman, given enough time, will grow to loathe you.\\
324 - My God, you're right.\\
325 - So I just have to stick it out with Naomi\\
326 - until she hates my guts.\\
327 - How long could it take?\\
328 - BERTA: Damn it.\\
329 - Charlie, get your lazy ass out of that bed.\\
330 - Hello, bright eyes.\\
331 - Hi.\\
332 - I bagged you a lunch to take to work.\\
333 - No kidding.\\
334 - Yeah.\\
335 - I also tossed in a packet of vitamin E.\\
336 - Help you chalk up the old pool cue for Naomi.\\
337 - Thanks.\\
338 - C'mere, gimme some sugar.\\
339 - Mwah.\\
340 - Oh, you are so screwed.\\
341 - Here you go.\\
342 - One hot chocolate for the lactating mommy.\\
343 - Thank you.\\
344 - I see little Brittany Pam is having the grande boobaccino.\\
345 - Yeah,\\
346 - and she's bitin' the straw.\\
347 - Listen, you got any plans for Saturday night?\\
348 - I don't think so. Why?\\
349 - Well, my mom wants to have a big family dinner over at her place.\\
350 - Family?\\
351 - Uh, whose family?\\
352 - You know, me, you, Jake, Charlie, my mom, your mom.\\
353 - Oh, oh.\\
354 - Well, uh, that sounds like fun.\\
355 - Doesn't it? Yeah.\\
356 - Yeah, unfortunately, I'm busy this Saturday.\\
357 - But you just said...\\
358 - I misspoke.\\
359 - Oh, I get it.\\
360 - I'm not good enough to meet your mother.\\
361 - Oh, no, no, no, I'm, I'm just, uh,\\
362 - I'm concerned about the baby.\\
363 - Why?\\
364 - Oh, boy, uh, I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you this,\\
365 - but my mother...\\
366 - feeds on the souls of the young.\\
367 - Okay, just forget it.\\
368 - Oh, come on, Naomi, I mean,\\
369 - don't you think a family dinner's pushing things\\
370 - a little too fast?\\
371 - Too fast? You weren't worried\\
372 - about things going too fast on our first date\\
373 - when you chewed through my nursing bra.\\
374 - In my defense, I didn't know about the flaps.\\
375 - Well, I thought that you were different.\\
376 - I am different. Ask anybody.\\
377 - They'll tell ya, Alan's different.\\
378 - No, no, no, you're not.\\
379 - You're just like all the rest.\\
380 - Flirtsy, squirtsy and then arriva-dirtsy.\\
381 - Naomi, I didn't mean... Well, I'm not that\\
382 - kind of girl anymore.\\
383 - I'm a mama now and I demand to be treated with respect!\\
384 - Sweetie, sweetie, calm down.\\
385 - I do respect you.\\
386 - I just thought the dinner was a little premature.\\
387 - Premature?\\
388 - You weren't worried about being premature on our first date\\
389 - when you ruined a perfectly good sweater!\\
390 - You know what? You know what?\\
391 - Saturday's fine.\\
392 - Dinner sounds great. We'll be there.\\
393 - Yeah, damn right you'll be there.\\
394 - What you never seen a screamin' woman with a bare boob?\\
395 - This is just mortifying.\\
396 - Mom.\\
397 - It's one thing to diddle the help, Alan.\\
398 - It's another thing to dine with them.\\
399 - Jake, are you listening to your iPod?\\
400 - No. Well, start.\\
401 - Naomi is not the help.\\
402 - Oh, forgive me.\\
403 - She's the maid's round-heeled daughter.\\
404 - I mean, I'd expect this from Charlie.\\
405 - He'd hump a grilled cheese sandwich.\\
406 - Thanks, Mom.\\
407 - You're welcome, darling.\\
408 - And what, pray, is going on with your ear?\\
409 - Uh, it's fine.\\
410 - It looks like a cherry tomato.\\
411 - His lady friend thinks it's "darn sexy."\\
412 - Well, don't worry.\\
413 - I'm guessing you won't be the only one\\
414 - at the table tonight with a raging infection.\\
415 - It's not infected.\\
416 - It's got a pulse, Alan.\\
417 - Look, Mom, there is no reason\\
418 - to look down your nose at Naomi.\\
419 - She and her mother are decent, hard-working,\\
420 - salt-of-the-Earth people.\\
421 - Well, pardon me.\\
422 - You know, it's tacky to arrive empty-handed.\\
423 - Perhaps we should stop\\
424 - and pickup a box of wine or some aerosol cheese.\\
425 - Oh, Mom, you're on fire tonight.\\
426 - It's the new meds.\\
427 - They mix well with liquor.\\
428 - Oh, this was a bad idea.\\
429 - Charlie, didn't you tell him that's the gay ear?\\
430 - This is some nice flatware.\\
431 - I, I gave this same pattern to Charlie for his birthday.\\
432 - Yeah, he gave it to me.\\
433 - Next year, he wants a roasting pan.\\
434 - You gave away my flatware?\\
435 - To be fair, Mom, I gave it to you.\\
436 - So, Berta, nice house.\\
437 - When do we take the tour?\\
438 - Have you been to the can yet?\\
439 - Yeah.\\
440 - You took it.\\
441 - Oh, okay.\\
442 - I wanna make a toast.\\
443 - Oh, good, a reason to drink.\\
444 - To Naomi and Alan.\\
445 - Thank God they found each other.\\
446 - 'Cause, let's face it, they were both running out of options.\\
447 - Hear, hear. Hang on, hang on.\\
448 - Uh, I'd like to propose an addendum to the toast,\\
449 - uh, a subordinate clause if you will.\\
450 - Uh, while Naomi and I are enjoying each other's company,\\
451 - we, uh, we are proceeding\\
452 - in a very slow and cautious manner.\\
453 - Except when we're having sex.\\
454 - Time and place, Naomi.\\
455 - Time and place.\\
456 - Yeah, well, I wish you'd spend a little more time\\
457 - and aim for the right place.\\
458 - Oh, God, just kill me now.\\
459 - Jake?\\
460 - Headphones? Thataboy.\\
461 - Excuse me, uh...\\
462 - I'd like to say a few words\\
463 - before we fold up the dining room table\\
464 - and commence the square dancing.\\
465 - Alan, you're my son and I love you.\\
466 - But you and I are through.\\
467 - What?\\
468 - I just can't bear it anymore.\\
469 - I have to cut you loose.\\
470 - Is that all it takes?\\
471 - Hey, Berta, you got any other daughters?\\
472 - (knocking)\\
473 - HECTOR: Naomi? Are you in there?!\\
474 - Hector?\\
475 - Go away! Nobody's home!\\
476 - Mom!\\
477 - If that loser steps one foot inside this house,\\
478 - I'm gettin' out my nail gun.\\
479 - Oh, wonderful, we're gonna be on an episode of Cops.\\
480 - What are you doing here?\\
481 - I've come to see my daughter.\\
482 - Is that her? What do you care?\\
483 - You ran off. No, I didn't run off, mija.\\
484 - I couldn't get back across the border.\\
485 - They're crackin' down 'cause of these damn Arabs.\\
486 - Why didn't you call me?\\
487 - I did call.\\
488 - Didn't your mother give you my messages?\\
489 - Whoops.\\
490 - Oh, Hector, I've missed you so much.\\
491 - I missed you too.\\
492 - Alan.\\
493 - Yeah?\\
494 - Your relationship has run its natural course.\\
495 - She doesn't hate me yet. She, she's just like...\\
496 - A toast to Hector and Naomi.\\
497 - May their love last forever.\\
498 - Salud. Hear, hear.\\
499 - What's with your ear?\\
500 - I'm gay.\\
501 - Berta?\\
502 - Don't bother me, Charlie.\\
503 - I had a hard night.\\
504 - If you're so tired, why don't you just stay home?\\
505 - Are you kidding?\\
506 - Hector invited his entire family over to see the baby.\\
507 - It's like the Alamo over there.\\
508 - Well, for the record,\\
509 - I didn't get any sleep either.\\
510 - Halfway home Alan's ear blew up\\
511 - and we had to take him to the emergency room.\\
512 - Is he okay?\\
513 - Yeah, they were able to save the lobe,\\
514 - but I don't think anyone's gonna call it\\
515 - the gay ear anymore.\\
516 - Huh.\\
517 - Well, sweet dreams.\\
518 - You too.
\subsection {Episode 13: Don't Worry, Speed Racer}
1 - I have a question.\\
2 - Yeah?\\
3 - How smart do you have to be to have sex?\\
4 - Well, actually...\\
5 - Uh-uh-uh...\\
6 - Can I...?\\
7 - Uh-uh-uh...\\
8 - But I was...\\
9 - Uh-uh-uh!\\
10 - Oh, come on.\\
11 - Uh-uh-uh!\\
12 - Why do you ask?\\
13 - Mom's boyfriend's a doctor.\\
14 - Yeah?\\
15 - And doctors are supposed to be smart, right?\\
16 - Not as smart as they think they are, but, uh...\\
17 - but go ahead.\\
18 - Well, when I'm in bed,\\
19 - I can hear them in bed.\\
20 - Oh, God.\\
21 - Oh, boy.\\
22 - Oh, goody.\\
23 - And Mom's always telling him that\\
24 - he doesn't know what he's doing.\\
25 - How much do I love this kid?\\
26 - Don't interrupt, Charlie.\\
27 - Go on, sweetheart.\\
28 - So I'm thinking sex must be a lot harder than I figured.\\
29 - I mean, she has to tell him the same thing every night.\\
30 - Every night, you say?\\
31 - Berta.\\
32 - You had a semi-annual\\
33 - subscription, didn't you?\\
34 - Come on, you guys, please?\\
35 - Can't help you. Sorry, no.\\
36 - Look, Jake, it's, it's not\\
37 - that you have to be particularly smart to have sex.\\
38 - BOTH: Yeah, look at your dad.\\
39 - Jinx, you owe me a Coke.\\
40 - Think of it this way.\\
41 - Suppose you like banana cream pie.\\
42 - I do like banana cream pie.\\
43 - Well, good.\\
44 - Do we have any?\\
45 - No.\\
46 - Well, then, why'd you bring it up?\\
47 - I was trying to tell you something about sex.\\
48 - What does pie have to do with sex?\\
49 - Can I jump in...?\\
50 - Uh-uh-uh!\\
51 - How about me?\\
52 - Excuse me, but if I can't talk,\\
53 - you can't talk.\\
54 - Am I right, Alan?\\
55 - Anyway...\\
56 - If you don't tell me\\
57 - you like banana cream pie and I keep bringing home\\
58 - something else... But I just told you I like it.\\
59 - You want to know\\
60 - what kind of pie your Uncle Charlie likes?\\
61 - Uh-uh!\\
62 - Oh, come on, I...\\
63 - Uh-uh-uh!\\
64 - I'm guessing cherry.\\
65 - Uh-uh-uh!\\
66 - Please, I've got this.\\
67 - You've got squat.\\
68 - At this rate, the kid's only\\
69 - gonna get a stiffie at Marie Callendar's.\\
70 - Okay. Okay.\\
71 - Forget the pie.\\
72 - Uncle Charlie said "stiffie."\\
73 - Yeah, I heard him.\\
74 - My point is, you don't have to worry\\
75 - about being smart enough to have sex, okay?\\
76 - Okay.\\
77 - In fact, there are times\\
78 - when brains and imagination are a distinct disadvantage.\\
79 - Like when you've been married for 12 years\\
80 - and you're only allowed to do\\
81 - the same three things over and over again.\\
82 - In exactly the same way\\
83 - and exactly the same order.\\
84 - like you were some kind of unthinking machine\\
85 - or a trained fricking monkey.\\
86 - Okay. Honestly, how much more damage could we have caused?\\
87 - I bet monkeys like banana cream pie.\\
88 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
89 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
90 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
91 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
92 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
93 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
94 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
95 - (doorbell ringing)\\
96 - Hi, honey.\\
97 - Hi, Mom. What's in the box?\\
98 - Banana cream pie.\\
99 - You bought him a whole pie?\\
100 - I bought him two pies.\\
101 - Why would you do that?\\
102 - It seemed easier than explaining to him that his mother's fianc  \\
103 - isn't really a sexual moron.\\
104 - Oh, hey, Alan.\\
105 - Herb.\\
106 - Why is Jake eating pie in the bathroom?\\
107 - Not now, not now.\\
108 - What are you talking about?\\
109 - Jake can hear you two in bed.\\
110 - Oh, God.\\
111 - Oh, God.\\
112 - He didn't hear that.\\
113 - Um...\\
114 - Wh-What, what did he say to you?\\
115 - Well, uh, basically he's worried that when he grows up,\\
116 - he won't be smart enough to have sex\\
117 - Why would he think that?\\
118 - Because he hears you giving Herb instructions\\
119 - like he's a blind guy in a mine field.\\
120 - (laughing)\\
121 - You think that's funny?\\
122 - No.\\
123 - Well, I will talk to him.\\
124 - No, no. Trust me, talking only makes it worse.\\
125 - Charlie and I tried.\\
126 - Oh, great, Charlie knows about this?\\
127 - That's not the point, Judith. The point is,\\
128 - you need to be a little less vocal.\\
129 - Maybe do what you did with me and smack him\\
130 - on the back of the head when he goes off course.\\
131 - She does that, too.\\
132 - Well, um...\\
133 - Thank you, Alan, I will take care of this.\\
134 - Um...\\
135 - I'm sorry to dump this on you.\\
136 - Oh, that's okay.\\
137 - I mean, you know, I'm, I'm not judging.\\
138 - I've been in your position.\\
139 - Well, she only likes the one.\\
140 - Yeah, yeah. Been there, done that.\\
141 - Mm-hmm.\\
142 - Or, more correctly,\\
143 - Uh, been there, told I was doing that wrong.\\
144 - Oh, yeah.\\
145 - The truth is, I, uh...\\
146 - I kind of like the instructions.\\
147 - It takes out all the guesswork.\\
148 - Sure. Sure.\\
149 - I tend to meander when I don't have, you know, a game plan.\\
150 - Yeah, well, that's never a problem with Judith.\\
151 - She's the Vince Lombardi of sexual intercourse.\\
152 - Well, she did teach me to play through the pain.\\
153 - Yeah. Tape it up and get back in there.\\
154 - Say good-bye, Herb.\\
155 - Bye. Bye.\\
156 - * Men.\\
157 - ...throws it to the quarterback and Miller has gotta stand back.\\
158 - He's got it at the one-yard line!\\
159 - (crowd cheering)\\
160 - Hey.\\
161 - Hey.\\
162 - How'd it go with Judith?\\
163 - It was the most awkward and uncomfortable conversation\\
164 - I've had in my life.\\
165 - Huh. More awkward than when you were a kid\\
166 - and had to explain to Mom why you were hiding\\
167 - a slab of raw liver in your sock drawer?\\
168 - Okay, the second most awkward.\\
169 - What about when she found the warm cantaloupe\\
170 - with a face drawn on it?\\
171 - All right, this was in the top five.\\
172 - I mean...\\
173 - it's just unnatural for a guy to have to tell his ex-wife\\
174 - to pipe down while she's having sex with another man.\\
175 - I'll tell you what's unnatural.\\
176 - The look on that melon's face.\\
177 - Fruit should not look surprised.\\
178 - You're the one who gave me that idea.\\
179 - I was joking.\\
180 - You told me it was what the astronauts do.\\
181 - Oh, right.\\
182 - That's how I got you to pee in the Tang jar.\\
183 - Oh, and let's not forget\\
184 - how I convinced you Mom's douche bag was your air supply.\\
185 - Yeah. Yeah.\\
186 - My breath smelled like vinegar for two weeks.\\
187 - Ah... those were innocent times.\\
188 - * Men.\\
189 - Oh, the kitchen appliances are a little outdated, but you people\\
190 - can cook with your wrist watches now, can't you?\\
191 - (laughing)\\
192 - You're funny.\\
193 - You're a funny firecracker.\\
194 - Mom?\\
195 - Oh. Charlie.\\
196 - Say hello to Hiroshi Goto.\\
197 - Hi. Hello.\\
198 - Charlie is my number one son.\\
199 - Yeah, but she treats me like number two.\\
200 - Mom, can I talk to you for a minute?\\
201 - Well, of course, darling.\\
202 - Hiroshi, why don't you go\\
203 - enjoy the view from the deck?\\
204 - There's usually pretty girls\\
205 - playing volleyball out on the beach.\\
206 - Oh. I like volleyball.\\
207 - All right, here's what you need to know.\\
208 - He's filthy rich and he's looking for a house on the beach\\
209 - and I have nothing to show him.\\
210 - So you're selling him my house?\\
211 - Don't worry. I told him you were going through an ugly divorce,\\
212 - but before we close escrow, you'll reconcile with Sheryl\\
213 - and back out of the sale.\\
214 - Who's Sheryl?\\
215 - She is a sweet, selfless girl\\
216 - who worked nights to put you through law school\\
217 - while you were sleeping with her sister.\\
218 - Anyway, I have to string Mr. Goto along until I have\\
219 - something to show him that actually is for sale.\\
220 - Oh, I understand.\\
221 - It's called a bait-and-switch and it's a felony.\\
222 - Oh, well, look at you taking the moral high ground.\\
223 - And with nary a bottle or whore in sight.\\
224 - Bravo.\\
225 - Uh, excuse me, why is there an Asian man on the deck?\\
226 - Mom's selling my house.\\
227 - Why?\\
228 - Marital problems.\\
229 - You cheating bastard.\\
230 - Do I have to find another place to live?\\
231 - Yes.\\
232 - Don't worry, sweetheart.\\
233 - Mommy's just running a little scam.\\
234 - But feel free to find another place to live.\\
235 - Anyway, what's new?\\
236 - How's my grandson?\\
237 - Oh, he's, he's fine.\\
238 - Oh, come on, Alan, tell her about the pie.\\
239 - What pie?\\
240 - There's no pie.\\
241 - Jake overheard his mother...\\
242 - (spouts gibberish)\\
243 - It's nothing.\\
244 - I just had to have a rather embarrassing conversation\\
245 - with Judith yesterday.\\
246 - More embarrassing than when you were 11 years old,\\
247 - and I caught you with the dog and the peanut butter.\\
248 - You went and did that, too?\\
249 - You told me it was what the cowboys did on a cattle drive.\\
250 - And I didn't have a cow.\\
251 - Is that why you got rid of our dog?\\
252 - I couldn't look at him anymore.\\
253 - Can we move on? Please?\\
254 - I'm sorry, dear. Now, what about Jake?\\
255 - I loved that dog.\\
256 - Well, not as much as your brother did.\\
257 - But go ahead, Alan, what did you have to talk to Judith about?\\
258 - Nothing. Forget it.\\
259 - Oh, come on, Alan.\\
260 - The dog whisperer here got bent all out of shape\\
261 - 'cause Jake caught his mother going at it\\
262 - with her new boyfriend.\\
263 - That's it? He just heard them?\\
264 - That's not enough to traumatize him?\\
265 - Absolutely not.\\
266 - See, Alan, I told you.\\
267 - You would know, Charlie.\\
268 - What do you mean?\\
269 - You don't remember?\\
270 - Remember what?\\
271 - Nothing.\\
272 - I like it!\\
273 - Of course you do.\\
274 - Let me show you the master suite.\\
275 - That's where she caught him.\\
276 - Ah, cheating bastard.\\
277 - What am I supposed to remember?\\
278 - I was the only one that gave that dog\\
279 - any kind of attention.\\
280 - * Men.\\
281 - (moaning)\\
282 - No...\\
283 - (gasps)\\
284 - I remember.\\
285 - * Men.\\
286 - (glass tings)\\
287 - (liquid pouring)\\
288 - (ice tinkling)\\
289 - Charlie?\\
290 - Yeah?\\
291 - What are you doing?\\
292 - Drinking.\\
293 - Why are you doing it here?\\
294 - I can't be alone right now.\\
295 - Okay. What's going on?\\
296 - I remembered, Alan.\\
297 - Remembered what?\\
298 - I was eight years old, it was late at night.\\
299 - I must have had a bad dream or something\\
300 - 'cause I walked into Mom's room and I saw them.\\
301 - Saw who?\\
302 - Mom and some guy.\\
303 - They didn't hear me at first\\
304 - 'cause the water bed was making a lot of sloshing noises.\\
305 - At least I hope it was the water bed.\\
306 - Oh, yeah, Mom's water bed.\\
307 - Remember how we used to bounce\\
308 - up and down on it playing lumberjack and...?\\
309 - Will you forget the damn bed?!\\
310 - The bed's not important.\\
311 - Sorry.\\
312 - Anyway,\\
313 - at some point they realized I was standing there,\\
314 - and the guy said to me, "Don't worry, Speed Racer,\\
315 - I'm not hurting your mom."\\
316 - Speed Racer?\\
317 - Remember, I had the Speed Racer pajamas?\\
318 - Oh, yeah, yeah, our Christmas pajamas.\\
319 - Yeah, you got Speed Racer and I got Laverne & Shirley.\\
320 - So typical.\\
321 - This is not about you, Alan!\\
322 - This is about a horrible moment in my life\\
323 - that I completely repressed:\\
324 - Mom and the man with the big red mustache.\\
325 - Oh, God.\\
326 - I just realized why Yosemite Sam always made me nauseous.\\
327 - And I'll tell you the worst part.\\
328 - Worse than Laverne & Shirley pajamas?\\
329 - Alan...\\
330 - I am amazed I'm not a raging queen.\\
331 - We all are.\\
332 - Anyway, the next morning I asked Mom what happened\\
333 - and she said she didn't know what I was talking about.\\
334 - And when I kept asking, she threw a shoe at my head.\\
335 - Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah, the four-inch heels.\\
336 - Oh, she was deadly accurate with those.\\
337 - She could knock a melon out of your hands\\
338 - from clear across the room.\\
339 - Will you get your mind out of the produce section?\\
340 - I've got a problem here.\\
341 - Come on, Charlie. It happened years ago\\
342 - and you turned out...\\
343 - Yeah, you got a problem.\\
344 - Thank you.\\
345 - I got to tell you,\\
346 - it does help me feel a little better about Jake.\\
347 - I mean, he didn't see anything,\\
348 - and at least we haven't been lying to him\\
349 - about having sex.\\
350 - No, no, you just taught him to associate sex with pie.\\
351 - Hey, at least I didn't talk him into\\
352 - putting crotchless panties on a Butterball turkey.\\
353 - Oh, right.\\
354 - Best Thanksgiving ever.\\
355 - You told me it's how the pilgrims got through the harsh winter.\\
356 - * Men.\\
357 - HERB: Oh, come on. He's got to be asleep by now.\\
358 - JUDITH: It doesn't matter. He could wake up.\\
359 - So we'll be quiet.\\
360 - I can't be quiet.\\
361 - Oh, come on. Please?\\
362 - Oh, all right.\\
363 - (both giggle)\\
364 - No, no, not that way.\\
365 - Slow down!\\
366 - (knocks loudly)\\
367 - I'm still awake!\\
368 - Are you happy?\\
369 - I may never be happy again.\\
370 - Mm, pie.\\
371 - * Men.\\
372 - Rose, did you ever suddenly remember something\\
373 - that you blocked out years ago?\\
374 - You mean like a repressed memory?\\
375 - Yeah.\\
376 - Yeah. You ever had a repressed memory?\\
377 - I forget.\\
378 - Get it? A little psychology humor.\\
379 - Freud was the first one to use it.\\
380 - Aha.\\
381 - It's much funnier in German.\\
382 - Hast due mals gehabt ein unterdrucktes Gedachtnis?\\
383 - Ich vergesse.\\
384 - So what memory did you repress?\\
385 - When I was eight, I walked in on my mother having sex.\\
386 - Interesting.\\
387 - Interesting?\\
388 - How about devastating, horrifying, traumatizing?\\
389 - Wow. What, was she, like, blindfolded and tied to a bed\\
390 - while two guys slapped her butt with Ping-Pong paddles?\\
391 - No.\\
392 - Hmm. Was she riding around the room on a goat\\
393 - while an albino midget dripped honey...?\\
394 - No, no! No.\\
395 - It was just sex.\\
396 - One mother, one man.\\
397 - (singsongy): Boring.\\
398 - Oh, come on, Charlie.\\
399 - It's not an uncommon occurrence.\\
400 - I myself have walked in on many people having sex.\\
401 - Accidentally?\\
402 - My point is, you've recovered the memory,\\
403 - and you can get on with your life.\\
404 - No, I can't.\\
405 - What if it's not the only repressed memory?\\
406 - What else is lying just below the surface\\
407 - ready to burst into my consciousness?\\
408 - Am I going to wake up tonight remembering\\
409 - my mother in the shower with my Uncle Donald?\\
410 - Who I suddenly realized wasn't really my uncle?\\
411 - Sounds like you don't have to worry about that one anymore.\\
412 - Oh, God, it's all coming back.\\
413 - Uncle Donald, Uncle Steve...\\
414 - Uncle Jorge.\\
415 - I bet I wasn't related to any of those guys.\\
416 - This is all good, Charlie. Keep going.\\
417 - Oh, boy.\\
418 - What?\\
419 - Not only was Aunt Wendy not my aunt,\\
420 - there was no snakebite on her boob.\\
421 - (doorbell rings)\\
422 - Oh, hey. What are you doing here?\\
423 - Uh, well, we were hoping that...\\
424 - Actually, I was hoping that, uh, maybe...\\
425 - He wants me to stay here tonight\\
426 - so he and Mom can have sex.\\
427 - Oh. Jake, I'm sure that's not the reason, right, Herb?\\
428 - No, that's pretty much it.\\
429 - Excuse me.\\
430 - Where are you going?\\
431 - To tell Mom that her indiscriminate bed-hopping\\
432 - has scarred me for life.\\
433 - Jury's still out on me.\\
434 - * Men.\\
435 - (doorbell rings)\\
436 - (camera whirring)\\
437 - EVELYN: What do you want, Charlie?\\
438 - We need to talk.\\
439 - You should have called first.\\
440 - I'm a little under the weather.\\
441 - Yeah, well, I'm not feeling so great myself.\\
442 - I've started remembering things.\\
443 - Well, call the poor girls,\\
444 - apologize and stop drinking so much.\\
445 - No, I'm remembering things about you.\\
446 - Things from my childhood.\\
447 - Wait a minute. What are you doing?\\
448 - You can't even look at me, can you?\\
449 - I don't care what you think you remember.\\
450 - I was a terrific mother who loved you\\
451 - even though you were a horrible little boy.\\
452 - Now go away.\\
453 - Mom, this is important!\\
454 - Mom?\\
455 - You ruined Yosemite Sam for me!\\
456 - Dagnabit, this isn't over.\\
457 - Oh, God!\\
458 - EVELYN: Charlie?\\
459 - MAN ( with foreign accent): Don't worry, slugger. I'm not hurting your mother.\\
460 - Good night, Berta.\\
461 - Hey, Dad, guess what I found in Mom's bedroom.\\
462 - You know what? I'll take a cab.\\
463 - An empty canof whipped cream.\\
464 - Whipped cream. No kidding?\\
465 - Yep. And you know what I'm thinking?\\
466 - I know what I'm thinking.\\
467 - Uh-uh-uh!\\
468 - What?\\
469 - Either whipped cream has something to do with sex,\\
470 - or Mom hides pie in her nightstand, too.\\
471 - Hey, a gal can do both.\\
472 - Uh-uh-uh!\\
473 - Hey.\\
474 - Hey, what happened to you?\\
475 - What are you talking about?\\
476 - I thought you went to Mom's.\\
477 - No.\\
478 - Then where were you?\\
479 - I don't remember.\\
480 - What do you mean, you don't remember?\\
481 - It's called a repressed memory.\\
482 - Now drop it!\\
483 - * Men.\\
484 - Any one of you you lily-livered, bowlegged varmints care\\
485 - to slap leather with me?!\\
486 - I'm the hootinest, tootinest, shootinest\\
487 - bobtailed wildcat!\\
488 - (gunfire)\\
489 - I'm the fastest gun north, south, east and west\\
490 - of the Pecos!\\
491 - (Looney Tunes theme plays)
\subsection {Episode 14: That's Summer Sausage, Not Salami}
1 - 'cause I'm drunk, aren't you?\\
2 - Yeah, I'm a bad girl.\\
3 - Lucky for both of us, I don't judge.\\
4 - JAKE: It's not my fault!\\
5 - ALAN: Then whose fault is it?\\
6 - JAKE: I told you. Uncle Charlie.\\
7 - I thought you lived alone.\\
8 - I do.\\
9 - I leave the TV on to deter criminals.\\
10 - ALAN: Charlie,\\
11 - did you tell Jake he could use your computer?\\
12 - (scoffs)\\
13 - Just take what you want and don't hurt us.\\
14 - Go ahead and tell him, Uncle Charlie.\\
15 - No one's talking to you.\\
16 - Can you explain to me why I caught him watching\\
17 - a Quicktime movie called Vanessa Does Van Nuys?\\
18 - Hey, meet Vanessa.\\
19 - Why don't you hop upstairs?\\
20 - I'll be right there.\\
21 - Okay.\\
22 - Hey, Dad, can we move to Van Nuys?\\
23 - No.\\
24 - VANESSA: Hey,\\
25 - whose skateboard? Mine.\\
26 - Wow. It's really rad.\\
27 - Thanks.\\
28 - So's your movie.\\
29 - Thanks.\\
30 - We're working on a sequel.\\
31 - Yeah, I'm gonna do Woodland Hills next.\\
32 - Hop, hop, hop, hop.\\
33 - Can we move to Woodland Hills?\\
34 - Forget Woodland Hills.\\
35 - Excuse me. We were talking\\
36 - about the dirty movie on your computer.\\
37 - I'm sorry. I forgot it was on there.\\
38 - You can't forget things like that\\
39 - when you have a child in the house.\\
40 - I'm not a child.\\
41 - And I don't have him.\\
42 - No one's talking to you,\\
43 - and that's no excuse.\\
44 - Look, it's not hardcore.\\
45 - It's mostly her\\
46 - and a couple of friends having a pajama party.\\
47 - I didn't see pajamas.\\
48 - Shut up. Go away.\\
49 - Again, I'm sorry.\\
50 - Mea culpa.\\
51 - Now, if you'll excuse me, mea goin' upstairs.\\
52 - For a culpa hours.\\
53 - BERTA: Hey, Charlie,\\
54 - who do I work for-- you\\
55 - or this fastidious parasite\\
56 - you call a brother?\\
57 - I get the feeling you want me to say me.\\
58 - Me. Definitely me.\\
59 - She works for me.\\
60 - Well, then, tell her when something\\
61 - is on the shopping list, she should in fact shop for it.\\
62 - I'm gonna slug him. Can I slug him?\\
63 - Why are you making such a big deal out of this? Because it is a big deal.\\
64 - No, it's not. The hell it isn't.\\
65 - Hey, what is going on here?\\
66 - It's very simple.\\
67 - I have decided to start drinking acidophilus milk.\\
68 - It promotes intestinal flora which aids in healthy digestion.\\
69 - Anyway, for three weeks,\\
70 - I have been writing it on the shopping list,\\
71 - yet Berta insists on bringing home two percent.\\
72 - Slug him.\\
73 - This is my life.\\
74 - Milk and skateboards.\\
75 - (thudding)\\
76 - It's a good thing I'm drunk.\\
77 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
78 - * Men.\\
79 - Extra large eggs.\\
80 - Extra large eggs.\\
81 - Acidophilus milk.\\
82 - Two percent milk, you whiny pinhead.\\
83 - Morning.\\
84 - Hey, how you feeling?\\
85 - Not too bad really.\\
86 - That was some fall you took.\\
87 - Yeah, if I hadn't been plastered,\\
88 - it might have killed me.\\
89 - You'd think the liquor industry would promote that.\\
90 - It is a selling point.\\
91 - Right up there with making ugly people doable.\\
92 - Two percent-- the king of milk.\\
93 - He's got to go, Charlie.\\
94 - What am I going to do, Berta, he's my brother.\\
95 - We could make it look like an accident.\\
96 - (doorbell ringing)\\
97 - No, no accidents.\\
98 - As long as my mother's alive nothing happens to Fredo.\\
99 - Hi.\\
100 - I am sorry to bother you, I'm just moving in next door.\\
101 - Really?\\
102 - You're my new neighbor?\\
103 - Thank you, God.\\
104 - Anyway, I just wanted to stop by and introduce myself.\\
105 - Danielle Stewart.\\
106 - Charlie Harper.\\
107 - Nice to meet you, Danielle.\\
108 - Come on in. Oh, thank you.\\
109 - We'll have a "welcome to the neighborhood" drink.\\
110 - It's 9:00 a.m.\\
111 - You're right, who drinks at 9:00 a.m.?\\
112 - I wouldn't mind a cup of coffee.\\
113 - Great.\\
114 - Oh, Berta? (angrily): What?!\\
115 - My faithful housekeeper.\\
116 - Would you be so kind\\
117 - as to bring a cup of coffee for our new neighbor?\\
118 - Sure.\\
119 - Luckiest S.O.B. on the planet.\\
120 - Please. Thank you.\\
121 - So, Danielle, what brings you\\
122 - to our little stretch of paradise?\\
123 - Me? Well, I just got tired of the cold winters in Chicago.\\
124 - Well, I don't want to scare you away,\\
125 - but winters here the mercury can dip down to the mid-60s.\\
126 - Oh, how will I stay warm?\\
127 - I recommend the buddy system.\\
128 - You're cute.\\
129 - I know.\\
130 - So, what did you do in Chicago?\\
131 - Well, for the last eight years\\
132 - I've had a full-time career\\
133 - trying to spend my divorce settlement.\\
134 - Oh, a working woman.\\
135 - Well, buying a Malibu beach house\\
136 - ought to take a big chunk out of that settlement.\\
137 - Yeah, you'd think.\\
138 - Whoa.\\
139 - Anyway, I've had my fun.\\
140 - I want to settle down, get serious with my life.\\
141 - Oh, yeah, me, too.\\
142 - No kidding.\\
143 - So, are you married?\\
144 - Me? Uh... no.\\
145 - Are you looking to get married?\\
146 - Uh... no.\\
147 - Do you like children?\\
148 - Uh... no.\\
149 - So how do you define getting serious with your life?\\
150 - Well, I've stopped drinking in the morning.\\
151 - Hey, Berta, where's that coffee?\\
152 - You men are all alike.\\
153 - Isn't there anyone left who just wants to get married\\
154 - and raise a family?\\
155 - Yeah, but they're all gay.\\
156 - Here we go.\\
157 - Thank you.\\
158 - Oh, you wouldn't happen to have any acidophilus milk, would you?\\
159 - Walk me through this again.\\
160 - She's beautiful, rich, divorced\\
161 - and you want to hand her off to Zippy the Chimp?\\
162 - Follow my reasoning here.\\
163 - This is a woman looking to settle down.\\
164 - If I sleep with her, I'm happy for one night.\\
165 - But if I teach my brother to sleep with her,\\
166 - he falls in love, asks her to marry him,\\
167 - moves out and I'm happy for the rest of my life.\\
168 - It's a nice plan, but it'll never happen.\\
169 - Don't-don't-don't say that.\\
170 - (spitting)\\
171 - Unjinx, unjinx, unjinx.\\
172 - Charlie, she is way out of his league.\\
173 - I know that. Everybody is out of his league.\\
174 - He doesn't even have a league.\\
175 - He's just a kid with a bat and a ball and a football helmet.\\
176 - But luckily he has me.\\
177 - Color me dubious.\\
178 - ALAN: I'm home.\\
179 - Come on, I need you to be with me on this one.\\
180 - It'll never work.\\
181 - Voila.\\
182 - This...\\
183 - is acidophilus milk.\\
184 - It's on the shelf below the two percent\\
185 - right next to the low-fat yogurt.\\
186 - Boy, does your brother have a girl for you.\\
187 - What?\\
188 - She just moved next door.\\
189 - She's gorgeous, divorced and loaded.\\
190 - Mm-hmm. What's wrong with her?\\
191 - Why does something have to be wrong with her?\\
192 - Because there's only two reasons you ever set me up with a woman.\\
193 - Either you need somebody to keep the emotionally disturbed\\
194 - or cross-eyed or hermaphroditic best friend busy\\
195 - while you do the pretty girl,\\
196 - or...\\
197 - okay, I guess there's just one reason.\\
198 - There is nothing wrong with Danielle.\\
199 - Berta, is she or is she not gorgeous?\\
200 - Hey, I'd do her.\\
201 - If she's so great, why are you giving her to me?\\
202 - You want the truth?\\
203 - It'd be a nice change of pace.\\
204 - All right, first of all,\\
205 - I am sorry about the hermaphroditic incident.\\
206 - "I'm sorry" doesn't make up for leaving me in a hotel room\\
207 - with a girl who had a vestigial penis.\\
208 - I didn't know.\\
209 - I was as surprised as you were.\\
210 - Charlie, no one was as surprised as I was.\\
211 - But let's move on.\\
212 - I'm not saying I didn't try to hit on our new neighbor,\\
213 - because I did.\\
214 - And? I got nowhere.\\
215 - She saw him for the mindless meat-seeking missile that he is.\\
216 - Anyway... I just thought you two might hit it off.\\
217 - I'm even making a little welcome basket\\
218 - for you to give to her, see?\\
219 - So, she's beautiful, rich and single?\\
220 - Right.\\
221 - Why would she want me?\\
222 - What kind of thing is that to say?\\
223 - Why wouldn't she want you?\\
224 - I'm broke, middle-aged, twice divorced\\
225 - sleeping on your on your hide-a-bed\\
226 - and sharing custody of a flatulent, underachieving son.\\
227 - We're gonna need a bigger basket.\\
228 - You're gonna need chloroform and a rope.\\
229 - * Men...\\
230 - Just remember, the most important thing\\
231 - is to project confidence.\\
232 - Got it.\\
233 - How do I look?\\
234 - Just project confidence.\\
235 - Here, you give her the welcome basket.\\
236 - All right, what do I say?\\
237 - "Welcome."\\
238 - Good, that's good.\\
239 - Oh, hi.\\
240 - Welcome.\\
241 - Danielle, this is my brother Alan.\\
242 - Alan, Danielle.\\
243 - Alan just wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood.\\
244 - Welcome.\\
245 - Thank you.\\
246 - You're welcome.\\
247 - Would you like to come in?\\
248 - I don't know, she seems kind of busy.\\
249 - Maybe we should come back... Go, go, go.\\
250 - I am sorry that the place is such a mess.\\
251 - Don't be silly.\\
252 - Moving takes time, right, Alan?\\
253 - Oh, yes.\\
254 - I remember the last time I moved,\\
255 - it was very time-consuming.\\
256 - I had to collect boxes and those packing peanuts,\\
257 - and boy, those things get everywhere.\\
258 - Hey, you know, that's summer sausage, not salami.\\
259 - A lot of people confuse the two.\\
260 - Interesting.\\
261 - So, why don't I\\
262 - open up this wine\\
263 - and we can toast to my new home.\\
264 - Good idea.\\
265 - None for me. Red wine makes me gassy.\\
266 - I'm sorry, I don't have anything else to offer.\\
267 - I haven't had time to go grocery shopping.\\
268 - Well, then you must be starving.\\
269 - Alan, I think we should take this young lady out to dinner.\\
270 - But I was planning on warming up the pot roast from Sunday night.\\
271 - The pot roast will keep.\\
272 - I don't know, it's right on the edge.\\
273 - Forget the pot roast.\\
274 - So what do you say? We could walk up the beach\\
275 - to Georgio's and grab a bite.\\
276 - You know, that sounds wonderful.\\
277 - Let me just throw on some clean clothes.\\
278 - Terrific.\\
279 - Great. I will be right back.\\
280 - Huh? Huh?\\
281 - She's incredible.\\
282 - Incredible my ass,\\
283 - she's perfect.\\
284 - Okay, a couple of pointers.\\
285 - First off,\\
286 - you never open with "gassy."\\
287 - I know that. It just came out.\\
288 - It's all right, it's all right.\\
289 - No, no permanent damage.\\
290 - Now what's going to happen here\\
291 - is I'm going to bail on dinner\\
292 - so you two can be alone.\\
293 - Really?\\
294 - 'Cause Georgia's is kind of pricey.\\
295 - Oh, geez.\\
296 - Here, tip big.\\
297 - Don't agonize over the math.\\
298 - I don't agonize.\\
299 - I just take the sales tax and double it\\
300 - which is roughly 15%.\\
301 - Unless, of course, the service is less than impeccable\\
302 - in which case I leave a flat five dollars.\\
303 - Alan, it's my money, go crazy.\\
304 - Fine, 18% it is.\\
305 - Now, dinner conversation.\\
306 - Don't talk about your boring job, your petty problems\\
307 - or your stupid hobbies.\\
308 - What else is there?\\
309 - Her petty problems, her stupid hobbies.\\
310 - No woman ever came home from a date complaining\\
311 - that all she did was talk about herself.\\
312 - Oh, that's good.\\
313 - And that way, I remain an enigma.\\
314 - Yeah, let's call you an enigma.\\
315 - All righty, do I look okay?\\
316 - You look beautiful, fantastic.\\
317 - Right, Alan?\\
318 - Welcome.\\
319 - Okay, let's go.\\
320 - Let me just lock up.\\
321 - Oh, no...\\
322 - What do you mean you have to go?\\
323 - I mean, uh, what's wrong?\\
324 - I just remembered I have some work I need to do.\\
325 - Oh, no!\\
326 - Oh, what a shame.\\
327 - Maybe we should do this another time.\\
328 - BOTH: No, no.\\
329 - You two go ahead, enjoy yourselves. Are you sure?\\
330 - He's sure. Let's go. Okay.\\
331 - See you later, Charlie.\\
332 - So, Danielle, you got any hobbies or problems?\\
333 - Yes, I know she's hot.\\
334 - But I'm thinking long-term, so shut up!\\
335 - * Men...\\
336 - * Men...\\
337 - Hey. Hey.\\
338 - Where have you been?\\
339 - Stuck in traffic.\\
340 - Danielle's coming over in a few minutes.\\
341 - Got to shower and change.\\
342 - Wow, you two are going out again?\\
343 - What can I say, Charlie?\\
344 - The girl digs my mojo.\\
345 - When did you get mojo?\\
346 - Scoff if you like,\\
347 - but that woman is entranced by the enigma\\
348 - that is Alan Jerome Harper.\\
349 - Unbelievable-- your plan is working.\\
350 - Told ya.\\
351 - There must be something wrong with that girl.\\
352 - There must be a lot wrong with that girl.\\
353 - Well, then it's a match made in heaven.\\
354 - There's something wrong with her\\
355 - and we know there's something wrong with him.\\
356 - (doorbell rings)\\
357 - Yeah, and before you know it, he'll move out,\\
358 - they'll get married\\
359 - and we'll be wondering what's wrong with their kids.\\
360 - Hey, Charlie.\\
361 - Hey, Danielle. Come on in.\\
362 - Thank you. Oh, man.\\
363 - If the kid wants to kill me\\
364 - why doesn't he just cut my brake line?\\
365 - Alan's in the shower.\\
366 - Am I too early?\\
367 - No, no. No, he's been living here for three years.\\
368 - You want a drink?\\
369 - No, thank you.\\
370 - I'm trying to cut down.\\
371 - Really? Why?\\
372 - Long story.\\
373 - Alan takes long showers.\\
374 - Longer when he's not dating.\\
375 - Thank you, Berta.\\
376 - So, tell me your story.\\
377 - It's a little embarrassing.\\
378 - Hey, all the good drinking stories are.\\
379 - After a night of partying\\
380 - at the Pomona State Fair,\\
381 - I once woke up on a tilt-a-whirl wearing nothing\\
382 - but a grass skirt and a tiny sombrero.\\
383 - No kidding?\\
384 - I've still got the sombrero.\\
385 - Okay, your turn.\\
386 - All right, um...\\
387 - the reason my marriage didn't work out...\\
388 - the reason none of my relationships work out,\\
389 - is because I tend to drink a little too much\\
390 - and then do things I regret.\\
391 - And by "things," you mean...?\\
392 - Men.\\
393 - Huh.\\
394 - And the occasional woman.\\
395 - Huh.\\
396 - Well, as stories go, I'd say this is a good one.\\
397 - At least yours doesn't end\\
398 - with a toothless carnie offering you a churro.\\
399 - You know, I had a feeling you'd understand.\\
400 - Alan is very sweet,\\
401 - but the guys I usually go for are more like... well, you.\\
402 - Huh.\\
403 - Anyway, I think I am ready for a nice normal relationship.\\
404 - No more getting blitzed and falling into bed\\
405 - with the first guy who asks me.\\
406 - Or a girl.\\
407 - Or a couple.\\
408 - Huh.\\
409 - Huh-huh-huh-huh.\\
410 - (clears throat)\\
411 - Excuse me.\\
412 - Okay, new plan.\\
413 - I'm going to boink Danielle\\
414 - and Alan's going to live here forever.\\
415 - Quelle surprise.\\
416 - Hello.\\
417 - It's not your night, Alan.\\
418 - What?\\
419 - Danielle, she's not right for you.\\
420 - But you said she was perfect for me.\\
421 - I was wrong.\\
422 - She's sick and twisted.\\
423 - That makes her perfect for me.\\
424 - I'm sorry, I'm not following.\\
425 - I was talking to her out there\\
426 - and it turns out she's a boozehound and a sex freak.\\
427 - What?\\
428 - I haven't seen that in her at all.\\
429 - I mean, I got a good-night kiss, but she was perfectly sober\\
430 - and her tongue did nothing freaky.\\
431 - That's because she's trying to hide who she really is.\\
432 - Who's that? Me!\\
433 - She's me, Alan, top to bottom,\\
434 - except, you know, from here to here.\\
435 - So what is you want me to do, step aside\\
436 - so you can lead her back to a life of sordid degradation?\\
437 - If you wouldn't mind.\\
438 - No! No! No!\\
439 - You gave her to me.\\
440 - There's no takebacks.\\
441 - All right, fine.\\
442 - We'll just let her make her own decision.\\
443 - All right, all right, may the better man win.\\
444 - You would be rooting for the shriveled man.\\
445 - Oh, now, just a little.\\
446 - You got it.\\
447 - That is a beautiful dress.\\
448 - Whoops.\\
449 - Ooh.\\
450 - Sorry.\\
451 - That's okay.\\
452 - Mm...\\
453 - buttery...\\
454 - with a slight citrus finish.\\
455 - Hmm.\\
456 - Ah!\\
457 - You know wine.\\
458 - Okay, Danielle, we'd better get going\\
459 - if we're gonna make that reservation.\\
460 - You're right. Well, thanks for the wine, Charlie.\\
461 - Whoa, whoa, what's the hurry?\\
462 - I was going to make a pitcher of margaritas.\\
463 - Ooh, I love margaritas!\\
464 - Be right back.\\
465 - Gee, Danielle, do you really want to sit here\\
466 - and drink with Charlie?\\
467 - Oh, yeah, you're right, Alan.\\
468 - You're a nice guy.\\
469 - You're good for me.\\
470 - Okay, Charlie, we're leaving!\\
471 - Wait, wait, wait, wait!\\
472 - If you don't have time for margaritas,\\
473 - I could mix one up in your mouth.\\
474 - Cut it out, Charlie.\\
475 - I know what you're trying to do?\\
476 - What are you talking about? I'm being a good host.\\
477 - (hushed): You're taking advantage of Danielle.\\
478 - No, no, I respect Danielle for who she is.\\
479 - ALAN: So do I. No, you respect Danielle\\
480 - for who she's pretending to be.\\
481 - I don't get you-- why did you bother\\
482 - putting us together in the first place?\\
483 - Because I thought she was dull and boring like you.\\
484 - and I had hoped the two of you would go\\
485 - and be dull and boring at her house!\\
486 - That was really your plan? That's insane!\\
487 - It would have worked if she wasn't a drunken slut!\\
488 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\\
489 - There is no need to fight over me.\\
490 - Alan, you're a sweet gentle guy.\\
491 - Charlie, you're a pig.\\
492 - But I find you very attractive.\\
493 - There's only one reasonable solution.\\
494 - I have to do you both.\\
495 - No crossing swords.\\
496 - Are you out of your mind?\\
497 - You're actually considering this?\\
498 - Yeah, you're right.\\
499 - I don't even like eating dinner next to you.\\
500 - Thank you\\
501 - for your generous offer,\\
502 - but I'm afraid we must decline.\\
503 - But mostly he's afraid.\\
504 - I should have known.\\
505 - Not a pair between you.\\
506 - Well, if either of you change your mind,\\
507 - you know where to find me.\\
508 - (gasps)\\
509 - Okay, you can have her.\\
510 - * Men...\\
511 - "One pound salted butter...\\
512 - "one dozen extra-large eggs...\\
513 - one acidophilus milk for the whiny pinhead."\\
514 - I thought I was the only one who drank this stuff.\\
515 - What? Are you kidding me?\\
516 - It's all I drink.\\
517 - You know, for the intestinal... fauna.\\
518 - That's all you drink?\\
519 - Well, I've been known\\
520 - to add a few fingers of vodka.\\
521 - Kind of a acidopha-tini.\\
522 - You're cute.\\
523 - So I've been told.\\
524 - I can't. I promised Berta I'd get the groceries.\\
525 - You're right. You're always right.
\subsection {Episode 15: My Damn Stalker}
1 - Hey.\\
2 - Oh, hey.\\
3 - You're back early.\\
4 - How was your date?\\
5 - I hate electric cars.\\
6 - I don't like scented candles.\\
7 - Once again, how was your date?\\
8 - It was fine until her estranged husband\\
9 - silently pulled into the driveway in his freakin' Prius.\\
10 - If he hadn't stepped on the cat, I'd be dead now.\\
11 - What are you doing?\\
12 - Me?\\
13 - Uh, nothing. Just, uh...\\
14 - nothing.\\
15 - You were surfing for porn, weren't you?\\
16 - Uh... yes.\\
17 - Okay, that's, that's what I was doing.\\
18 - You caught me.\\
19 - I'm so embarrassed.\\
20 - Well, you should be; it's disgusting.\\
21 - Come on, let's see what puts a chubby in your chinos.\\
22 - No, no, it's personal.\\
23 - Ooh, what are you into, grannies with trannies?\\
24 - Chickens with strap-ons?\\
25 - Please, please don't, Charlie. Pl...\\
26 - Oh, you pitiful freak!\\
27 - What is wrong with you?\\
28 - Nothing, I came upon it by accident.\\
29 - I am so ashamed.\\
30 - My own brother using an...\\
31 - Internet dating service.\\
32 - I'm a man, Charlie. I have needs.\\
33 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
34 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
35 - Okay, name three contributions\\
36 - that the Roman Empire made to civilization.\\
37 - Um... Roman numerals.\\
38 - Good.\\
39 - Aqueducts...\\
40 - Terrific.\\
41 - Do you know what an aqueduct is?\\
42 - Uh, something to do with water.\\
43 - And...?\\
44 - A duck?\\
45 - Morning.\\
46 - Morning.\\
47 - Morning, Charlie.\\
48 - Morning, Rose.\\
49 - (half-whispers): What's going on?\\
50 - She's helping Yertle the Turtle study for his test.\\
51 - Why didn't he ask me?\\
52 - Name three contributions\\
53 - the Roman Empire made to civilization.\\
54 - Orgies, wine and bulimia.\\
55 - Go ahead, ask me about the Greeks.\\
56 - Then who did invent aromatherapy?\\
57 - Not the Romans.\\
58 - But you see my logic.\\
59 - You know, I never did understand\\
60 - why you didn't give her more of a chance.\\
61 - She's pretty, smart,\\
62 - and amazingly patient with dumb guys.\\
63 - Are you talking about Jake or me?\\
64 - A smart guy wouldn't have to ask that question.\\
65 - Excuse me, but let's not forget\\
66 - this is a woman who stalked me,\\
67 - who spied on me, who snuck into my house\\
68 - to write her name and address in my underwear.\\
69 - Oh, boo-hoo.\\
70 - Somebody cares about Charlie.\\
71 - Nobody ever wrote their name in my underwear.\\
72 - Wait, once. The Department of Corrections.\\
73 - Morning.\\
74 - Hey. Morning.\\
75 - Hey, guys.\\
76 - How's the homework coming?\\
77 - The three major buildings in ancient Rome\\
78 - were the Coliseum, the Forum and...\\
79 - Circus...\\
80 - Circus Circus.\\
81 - We need a little more time.\\
82 - Carry on.\\
83 - I know it's not Caesar's Palace.\\
84 - Why don't you get him a real tutor?\\
85 - Are you kidding?\\
86 - She has advanced degrees in, like, three subjects,\\
87 - she loves him, he worships her,\\
88 - and the only thing she asks in return\\
89 - is to sit naked in your laundry hamper every once in a while.\\
90 - And that's not a red flag for you?\\
91 - You could do a lot worse than Rose, Charlie.\\
92 - I have done a lot worse.\\
93 - But that's not really a recommendation now, is it?\\
94 - The second triumvirate was Augustus, Mark Antony and...\\
95 - Lepidus.\\
96 - Very good.\\
97 - Okay, well, that's it for today.\\
98 - Wait a minute.\\
99 - Oh, right.\\
100 - Open up.\\
101 - Mmm, cookie.\\
102 - Hey, Charlie, you got a minute?\\
103 - I'd like to talk to you privately.\\
104 - Now's not a good time, Rose.\\
105 - Will you call me later?\\
106 - Sure.\\
107 - Promise?\\
108 - Yeah.\\
109 - Cross your heart and hope to die?\\
110 - (sighs)\\
111 - Yes.\\
112 - Stick a needle in your eye?\\
113 - Okay.\\
114 - Boil in oil until you fry?\\
115 - Dear God, Rose, I will call you.\\
116 - Toodles.\\
117 - You're not going to call her, are you?\\
118 - No, I think I'm going to go with the needle in the eye.\\
119 - * Men.\\
120 - (clippers buzzing)\\
121 - Funny, you didn't mention in your dating profile\\
122 - you've got hair growing out of all your holes.\\
123 - Hey, what are you doing to my laptop?\\
124 - Just learning a little about you, Spinemaster278.\\
125 - I see you like smooth jazz,\\
126 - long walks on the beach and cuddling.\\
127 - Give me that. Now hold on. Hold on.\\
128 - This is my favorite part.\\
129 - "I love to spend quiet weekends\\
130 - puttering around my Malibu beach house."\\
131 - Educate me, Alan.\\
132 - To what Malibu beach house are you referring?\\
133 - Okay, okay, I was going to tell you about that.\\
134 - Do you have one that I don't know about?\\
135 - No, no. 'Cause if you do,\\
136 - one of us should be living there.\\
137 - Are you going to let me explain, or not?\\
138 - What's to explain?\\
139 - You have a Malibu beach house and you're the...\\
140 - "chiropractor to the stars."\\
141 - Okay, what do you want me to call myself?\\
142 - Chiropractor to fat people in the valley?\\
143 - Everybody exaggerates on these things.\\
144 - Okay, I can understand that.\\
145 - You're probably not going to get a lot of responses\\
146 - to "bushy-nosed cheapskate,\\
147 - enjoys long walks to a free meal."\\
148 - Exactly.\\
149 - (doorbell rings)\\
150 - Hey, you're going out tonight, aren't you?\\
151 - Why?\\
152 - Well, I met a woman on this dating site\\
153 - and she's here and it would be good if...\\
154 - you weren't.\\
155 - You're throwing me out of my own house?\\
156 - Well, no, if you read the profile, it's my house.\\
157 - See?\\
158 - (doorbell rings) Coming!\\
159 - Be right there!\\
160 - Please play along.\\
161 - You're going to play along, right?\\
162 - I guess we'll find out together, won't we?\\
163 - Alan, hi.\\
164 - Beverly, it's so great to finally meet you in person.\\
165 - Hi.\\
166 - Hello.\\
167 - Oh, this is Charlie.\\
168 - Oh, right, your poor brother.\\
169 - Hi, Charlie.\\
170 - (slowly): How are you?\\
171 - Mmm, you smell nice.\\
172 - Okay, okay, come on in.\\
173 - Oh, my,\\
174 - what a beautiful home.\\
175 - Thank you. Thank you.\\
176 - I encourage him to think of this place as his own.\\
177 - Yeah, that way, I don't feel like such a worthless parasite.\\
178 - Charlie, weren't you going out tonight?\\
179 - Gee, I'd love to, but you know me, flat broke again.\\
180 - Oh, well, I suppose I could float you a few bucks.\\
181 - What do you need?\\
182 - $400.\\
183 - Okay. Okay.\\
184 - You know, I'll... I'll just give you everything I have.\\
185 - Uh... that's 31, 32... $33.\\
186 - What about the secret compartment?\\
187 - All right.\\
188 - That'll be a, uh...\\
189 - $133.\\
190 - And I don't expect to see you again tonight.\\
191 - Thanks, bro.\\
192 - Be nice to him; he's all I've got.\\
193 - Sorry about that.\\
194 - I understand.\\
195 - I have a sister who's a crack whore.\\
196 - Really?\\
197 - Maybe we can introduce them.\\
198 - For $133, we can introduce them twice.\\
199 - Terrific.\\
200 - Well, here we are.\\
201 - We sure are.\\
202 - I guess you've noticed\\
203 - I'm a little taller than five-nine.\\
204 - Well, yeah, but everybody fudges a little\\
205 - on those dating profiles.\\
206 - How tall are you?\\
207 - Five-thirteen.\\
208 - Leanne, tell me something,\\
209 - is it just me or is the crowd in here getting younger?\\
210 - No, the crowd's the same age it's always been.\\
211 - You, on the other hand, are not.\\
212 - I'm not old.\\
213 - 40's the new 30, right?\\
214 - Not the way you live, pal.\\
215 - Yeah, well, guess what?\\
216 - Not tipping is the new tipping.\\
217 - I gotta do more drinking at home.\\
218 - You didn't call.\\
219 - Did you follow me here?\\
220 - Please. If you're not home and you're not on a date,\\
221 - where else would you be?\\
222 - And, yes, I followed you here.\\
223 - There's something I need to tell you.\\
224 - What can I get you?\\
225 - Grain alcohol, please.\\
226 - We don't have grain alcohol.\\
227 - Okay, just a Sprite.\\
228 - What do you want, Rose?\\
229 - I don't want anything.\\
230 - I just have some news to share with you.\\
231 - Is this CNN kind of news,\\
232 - or something you heard from a friendly blue jay\\
233 - with a top hat and a cane?\\
234 - If you recall, that was a crow,\\
235 - and he was wearing a derby and safety goggles.\\
236 - And I've admitted that was a medication issue.\\
237 - Fine, whatever. What's the news?\\
238 - Well, my family has business interests in London,\\
239 - and I'm going to move there and take a job.\\
240 - Oh, terrific.\\
241 - So will you be running the chocolate factory?\\
242 - Did the OompaLoompas drop the ball?\\
243 - Charlie... The little bastards went union, didn't they?\\
244 - Oh, I'm going to miss that good-natured cynicism.\\
245 - You're probably wondering why I decided to leave.\\
246 - Actually, I was wondering\\
247 - what possessed them to remake that movie.\\
248 - Gene Wilder was perfect.\\
249 - I'm leaving because I'm not getting any younger\\
250 - and our relationship isn't really progressing\\
251 - along the path I'd hoped for.\\
252 - Rose, there is no relationship.\\
253 - There is no path.\\
254 - How very Zen of you.\\
255 - I'll always love you, Charlie.\\
256 - But this is best for both of us.\\
257 - Yeah. Right.\\
258 - Okay, well, have a good trip.\\
259 - Say hi to the Queen...\\
260 - of Hearts.\\
261 - Is your friend leaving?\\
262 - No, no, she never leaves.\\
263 - She's probably climbing into the trunk of my car as we speak.\\
264 - Hey, maybe you should follow me home to make sure I'm safe.\\
265 - I don't think my husband would approve.\\
266 - When did you get married?\\
267 - Shortly after the last time I woke up in your bed\\
268 - with cab fare taped to my forehead.\\
269 - I suddenly realized how empty and soulless my life had become.\\
270 - Thank you for that, by the way.\\
271 - Happy to help.\\
272 - How are you doing tonight?\\
273 - Oh, gee, I'm sorry, sir.\\
274 - I don't have daddy issues.\\
275 - And then a week before we were going to get married,\\
276 - he announces that he's leaving me for the wedding planner.\\
277 - Ouch!\\
278 - I was heartsick.\\
279 - I really cared for him.\\
280 - Well, of course you cared for him.\\
281 - Why else would you agree to marry him?\\
282 - No, I mean the wedding planner.\\
283 - Ouch. Well, we all have one or two heartbreaks in our life.\\
284 - Eight.\\
285 - Excuse me?\\
286 - I've been dumped eight times.\\
287 - Married, married, gay, parole violation,\\
288 - gay and married, deported, returned to the priesthood,\\
289 - and woman in a man's body.\\
290 - Whoa. And yet you haven't given up.\\
291 - Of course not.\\
292 - I may have to kiss a lot of frogs,\\
293 - but eventually I'll find my prince.\\
294 - Ribbit.\\
295 - I knew it. You're gay.\\
296 - No, no. I'm not gay.\\
297 - Well, whatever it is,\\
298 - I don't have the time or the strength to deal with it.\\
299 - Beverly, wait. Wait.\\
300 - You know my loser brother?\\
301 - I'm him.\\
302 - What?\\
303 - This is Charlie's house.\\
304 - After my divorce, I was broke, and he took me in.\\
305 - And I'm not the chiropractor to the stars.\\
306 - I mostly handle slip-and-fall insurance claims.\\
307 - That's all?\\
308 - What do you mean, "That's all?"?\\
309 - I mean, married, married, gay, parole violation...\\
310 - Alan, you're a catch.\\
311 - I am?\\
312 - Come on. You're single, you're straight,\\
313 - and you're a genetic male.\\
314 - So I guess the bar's not that high.\\
315 - Have you done much online dating?\\
316 - You cleared it with a penis and a job.\\
317 - And, just to put your mind at ease,\\
318 - I plan on keeping both of them.\\
319 - * Men.\\
320 - Hey, Berta, you want to to hear something cool?\\
321 - The ancient Romans had a place called a vomitorium\\
322 - where people could eat as much as they wanted,\\
323 - puke, and then eat some more.\\
324 - Well, just like The Sizzler.\\
325 - Hey. Morning, buddy.\\
326 - You suck.\\
327 - Whoa. Has the little prince not taken his morning poop yet?\\
328 - It's your fault that Rose is moving away.\\
329 - Oh, did she tell you that?\\
330 - Jake, she's not going anywhere.\\
331 - This is just one of her games to mess with my head.\\
332 - Berta, tell him.\\
333 - Jake, honey, your Uncle Charlie sucks.\\
334 - Come on, Berta.\\
335 - Hey, if you weren't such a self-centered pud,\\
336 - you'd realize what an angel she is,\\
337 - and you'd never let her go.\\
338 - Okay, first of all, she's not an angel.\\
339 - Second of all, she's not leaving.\\
340 - And third, and perhaps most important, "pud"?\\
341 - I cleaned it up for the kid.\\
342 - ALAN: * Love is lovelier\\
343 - * The ninth or tenth time around. *\\
344 - ALAN: Good morning, everybody.\\
345 - What's going on?\\
346 - Rose is moving to London.\\
347 - She is? Why?\\
348 - 'Cause Uncle Charlie is a pud.\\
349 - A "pud"?\\
350 - I cleaned it up for myself.\\
351 - Hey, Dad, can we go to Sizzler?\\
352 - * Men.\\
353 - This is nice, huh?\\
354 - Yeah.\\
355 - Listen, can I tell you a little secret?\\
356 - Sure.\\
357 - It's kind of embarrassing.\\
358 - Hey, you can tell me anything.\\
359 - All right. Well, before I came over tonight,\\
360 - I... put a toothbrush in my purse.\\
361 - What's so embarrassing about that?\\
362 - I don't go anywhere without floss.\\
363 - In fact, sometimes I'll snap off 18 inches\\
364 - and tuck it in my pocket in case, you know, I have a stubborn...\\
365 - Oh!\\
366 - You mean you and me? Tonight?\\
367 - Unless you don't want to.\\
368 - Want to? I'm almost done.\\
369 - CHARLIE: You know, Alan,\\
370 - I've been thinking about it,\\
371 - and Rose really crossed the line\\
372 - when she told Jake that crap about her moving away.\\
373 - Uh... yeah, listen.\\
374 - Kids take that stuff seriously, you know?\\
375 - I know, but...\\
376 - It's one thing to screw with me.\\
377 - It's another thing to screw with a child.\\
378 - No argument, but don't you think\\
379 - this is a conversation you should have with her?\\
380 - You're right. I'm going to settle this right now.\\
381 - Rose, climb up here! I want to talk to you!\\
382 - Are you sure you're the loser brother?\\
383 - That's always been the consensus.\\
384 - Excuse me.\\
385 - Come on, Rose, you crazy bitch!\\
386 - I know you're out there!\\
387 - Uh, uh, Charlie?\\
388 - What do you want me to do?\\
389 - Beg you to stay?\\
390 - I hate to interrupt, but I'm making some real headway in there,\\
391 - and you're kind of ruining the mood.\\
392 - Not now, Alan.\\
393 - I'm not going to beg you\\
394 - 'cause you're not going anywhere!\\
395 - I know you're not leaving, and you know you're not leaving!\\
396 - Charlie, that lovely lady in there brought her toothbrush\\
397 - 'cause I have a penis and a job.\\
398 - Rose!\\
399 - How is she going to brush your job?\\
400 - No, you don't understand.\\
401 - I don't have time for this, Alan.\\
402 - Charlie, are you okay?\\
403 - Yeah. I just can't find my damn stalker.\\
404 - He can't find his stalker?\\
405 - They're usually in the last place you look.\\
406 - But enough about him.\\
407 - If you will accompany me to the boudoir,\\
408 - I will convert an ordinary pull-out couch\\
409 - into a magic carpet for two.\\
410 - Are you sure you're not gay?\\
411 - I'm literate and urbane.\\
412 - You're not the first one to be confused.\\
413 - Right address.\\
414 - Oh, Charlie, you came to say good-bye.\\
415 - Unbelievable.\\
416 - You're going to play this all the way out to the end.\\
417 - Play what out?\\
418 - All right. Fine. We'll do it your way.\\
419 - Rose, you're a terrific woman,\\
420 - I'm an idiot for not seeing it,\\
421 - and I really don't want you to leave.\\
422 - Really?\\
423 - Yeah. Here, look.\\
424 - Wow.\\
425 - See?\\
426 - Oh, yeah.\\
427 - (horn honks)\\
428 - Well, that's my cab.\\
429 - Good-bye. Wait. Wait. What the hell are you doing?\\
430 - I'm leaving.\\
431 - Don't you understand?\\
432 - You can drop the act.\\
433 - I give up.\\
434 - I surrender.\\
435 - You win, Rose. I'm yours.\\
436 - Oh, Charlie, that's so sweet.\\
437 - But I know you, and you're just\\
438 - having a little panic attack\\
439 - because you're getting old and nobody loves you.\\
440 - See? You get me.\\
441 - I do, which is why I have to leave.\\
442 - Good-bye, Charlie.\\
443 - Oh, I almost forgot.\\
444 - I thought you should have this.\\
445 - It's our first restraining order.\\
446 - Look how shaky your signature was.\\
447 - You were so spooked.\\
448 - (horn honks)\\
449 - Oop! Got a plane to catch.\\
450 - Oh, come on, Rose! Stop it!\\
451 - (car door closes)\\
452 - All right, fine. Take your little cab ride.\\
453 - See you tomorrow.\\
454 - (car drives away)\\
455 - Okay.\\
456 - Maybe not tomorrow.\\
457 - Aw, damn.\\
458 - Hey, Charlie.\\
459 - Oh, hi. Where's Alan?\\
460 - In the bedroom. I have to get up early for work.\\
461 - Right. Well, see you.\\
462 - Bye.\\
463 - Hey, Beverly?\\
464 - I'm really glad you and Alan got together.\\
465 - It's... it's nice.\\
466 - Thank you.\\
467 - I hope things work out for you and your... stalker.\\
468 - Her name is Rose.\\
469 - Like the flower.\\
470 - Okey-dokey.\\
471 - See? It's on our restraining order.\\
472 - Uh-huh. Good night now.\\
473 - Hey, Alan?\\
474 - I'm not decent.\\
475 - Rose is really gone.\\
476 - What?\\
477 - I said Rose is gone.\\
478 - And I feel awful.\\
479 - Like maybe I made a huge mistake.\\
480 - Well, we all make mistakes.
\subsection {Episode 16: Young People Have Phlegm Too}
1 - Morning, Charlie.\\
2 - Charlie.\\
3 - Good, I don't have to give him mouth-to-mouth.\\
4 - Morning.\\
5 - Morning.\\
6 - He sleeping?\\
7 - Sure, let's call it sleep.\\
8 - Uncle Charlie, I'm gonna have a bowl of Maple Loops.\\
9 - You want one?\\
10 - You sure he's okay?\\
11 - I never said he was okay.\\
12 - Freaky.\\
13 - You really shouldn't see him like this, Jake.\\
14 - There. Now you can enjoy your breakfast.\\
15 - What's wrong with him?\\
16 - Oh, he's getting old, kiddo.\\
17 - I wish you could've seen him in his prime.\\
18 - He was like Babe Ruth.\\
19 - He played baseball?\\
20 - No, he was a drunken whore-monger.\\
21 - But there was none better.\\
22 - Oh, God, look what the cat dragged in.\\
23 - He didn't just drag it, he ate it, pooped it out\\
24 - and then covered it with sand.\\
25 - You know what'd be funny?\\
26 - To paint a big mustache on him.\\
27 - (chuckles)\\
28 - That would be hilarious...\\
29 - but no.\\
30 - Charlie?\\
31 - Charlie?\\
32 - Yeah?\\
33 - You okay?\\
34 - Yeah.\\
35 - What time did you get home?\\
36 - I'm home?\\
37 - You are.\\
38 - Oh, God, I'm blind.\\
39 - It's a miracle.\\
40 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
41 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
42 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
43 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
44 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
45 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
46 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
47 - Good night, Berta.\\
48 - Hey.\\
49 - Look who's finally up.\\
50 - How'd you sleep?\\
51 - Okay, I guess.\\
52 - Good, I'm glad.\\
53 - Oh, Tater Tots.\\
54 - Help yourself.\\
55 - Jake, I said no.\\
56 - I didn't do it.\\
57 - He didn't.\\
58 - (coughing)\\
59 - (clears throat)\\
60 - What are you staring at?\\
61 - Nothing, se  or.\\
62 - So, uh, how are you feeling?\\
63 - Depends.\\
64 - What day is it?\\
65 - Saturday.\\
66 - Oh.\\
67 - Well, in that case I feel great.\\
68 - Why "in that case"?\\
69 - If it was Thursday, I'd be a little worried.\\
70 - I don't know, Charlie,\\
71 - you've been pushing it pretty hard lately.\\
72 - What do you mean?\\
73 - I mean you're not a kid anymore.\\
74 - Oh, please.\\
75 - I'm in the best shape of my life.\\
76 - (coughing)\\
77 - (phlegmatic coughing)\\
78 - Now, that doesn't belong inside of me.\\
79 - It takes a lot to gross me out, but wow.\\
80 - Hey, get your stuff together.\\
81 - I'm going to bring you back to your mom's.\\
82 - Let me tell you something, Alan.\\
83 - You're only as young as the women you feel.\\
84 - And lately, I've been feeling about 24.\\
85 - Twenty-four?\\
86 - Yep, and she doesn't think I'm old.\\
87 - She thinks I'm cute and fun.\\
88 - And rich.\\
89 - Yeah, the rich helps.\\
90 - I'm not that cute.\\
91 - Okay, fine.\\
92 - I understand the allure, the nectar of the young berry.\\
93 - But I also know what happens\\
94 - when you burn a candle at both ends.\\
95 - How would you know that?\\
96 - Did you take a candle-making class at the Learning Annex?\\
97 - Hey, I have done my share of walking on the wild side.\\
98 - The wild side?\\
99 - Okay, the rambunctious side.\\
100 - My point is there comes a time in a man's life\\
101 - when he has to start accepting his limitations.\\
102 - Yeah, well, my point is the day you start accepting limitations\\
103 - is the day you start dying.\\
104 - And I'm not dying, my friend;\\
105 - I am living life to the fullest.\\
106 - Now, if you'll excuse me,\\
107 - I'm gonna go throw up and take a nap.\\
108 - * Men...\\
109 - That was fun!\\
110 - Yeah.\\
111 - How long until you're ready to go again?\\
112 - You mean tonight?\\
113 - Oh, yeah, I forgot.\\
114 - You're old.\\
115 - Hey, hey, hey, I'm not old.\\
116 - I'm just not a... yogurt dispenser.\\
117 - You're almost as old as my dad.\\
118 - All right, listen, if you're looking to go again,\\
119 - that's not the way to get there.\\
120 - Aw, did I hurt your feelings?\\
121 - No, no, you didn't hurt my feelings.\\
122 - It's just, you know, there are certain\\
123 - biological factors you have to take into account...\\
124 - Yeah, my dad takes Viagra.\\
125 - Good for him.\\
126 - All I'm saying is\\
127 - we could do something else for a while\\
128 - and then come back to this.\\
129 - Great, let's go to a club.\\
130 - Now?\\
131 - It's 11:00.\\
132 - So we'll get there early.\\
133 - Actually, I was thinking more along the lines of\\
134 - making some toaster pizzas and watching The Daily Show.\\
135 - Oh.\\
136 - What?\\
137 - I'm bored.\\
138 - If we're not gonna have sex, I want to go out.\\
139 - Okay, tell you what, why don't you go out\\
140 - and, you know, boogie-oogie-oogie,\\
141 - and when you come back, wake me up and we'll have sex.\\
142 - That's a lame idea, Charlie.\\
143 - Okay, you can skip the waking me up part.\\
144 - I'm just gonna go call some friends.\\
145 - No, no, wait, wait.\\
146 - Come here, come here.\\
147 - I think I'm ready to go again.\\
148 - Really? Really.\\
149 - I got nothing-- let's go dancing.\\
150 - * Men...\\
151 - Yeah, I'm coming with the guy I told you about, the old guy.\\
152 - I don't know.\\
153 - I think he's got a little brother who's old, too.\\
154 - I'll ask him.\\
155 - Great, we'll see you there.\\
156 - Hey, do you think your brother would want to come with us?\\
157 - Alan?\\
158 - No, he's not the type.\\
159 - He'd be miserable going to a dance club at this hour.\\
160 - Wait here, I'll go get him.\\
161 - (laughing)\\
162 - Hey. Oh, you just missed it.\\
163 - Jon Stewart made a very clever joke about the budget deficit.\\
164 - Swell.\\
165 - Get dressed, we're going dancing.\\
166 - Yeah, right.\\
167 - Toaster pizza?\\
168 - No, come on, let's go.\\
169 - You're serious? Yes.\\
170 - But it's after 11:00, and I'm all tucked in.\\
171 - Too bad.\\
172 - I'm drinking nighty-night tea.\\
173 - Come on, Robin wants to go dancing,\\
174 - and I'm gonna need a designated driver.\\
175 - Hey, just 'cause you're making a fool of yourself\\
176 - trying to keep up with a 24-year-old girl,\\
177 - doesn't mean I have to join you.\\
178 - She has a 24-year-old girlfriend.\\
179 - Is it dressy-dressy or dressy-casual?\\
180 - * Men...\\
181 - Just take it.\\
182 - Maybe it'll loosen you up.\\
183 - I don't think so.\\
184 - Recent studies indicate that ecstasy\\
185 - may well deplete your spinal fluid.\\
186 - Yeah, so?\\
187 - So?\\
188 - Young lady, I am a chiropractor.\\
189 - Whoo.\\
190 - You know what,\\
191 - my date isn't working out.\\
192 - Well, maybe you'd get somewhere\\
193 - if you stopped talking to her like you're her father.\\
194 - Well, somebody has to, because her real father\\
195 - has obviously dropped the ball.\\
196 - Oh, wonderful, a smoker.\\
197 - So I guess you're counting on stem cell research\\
198 - to replace your spine and lungs.\\
199 - Alan, Alan, you're embarrassing me.\\
200 - I'm embarrassing you? Look at yourself.\\
201 - You're standing in line in a dank alley\\
202 - in the middle of the Urine District.\\
203 - Hey, this is the hippest club in town.\\
204 - Oh, hip, schmip-- it's a toilet with a doorman.\\
205 - Somebody lit a doobie.\\
206 - Oh, yeah, oh, yeah,\\
207 - that is definitely the ganja.\\
208 - Great, now we're all gonna get busted.\\
209 - Will you just relax and let yourself have some fun?\\
210 - Oh, this is fun for you?\\
211 - Exhaust fumes and reefer smoke?\\
212 - Let me tell you something, Charlie.\\
213 - I'm not a kid anymore.\\
214 - I need plenty of rest, exercise\\
215 - and a high-fiber diet, and...\\
216 - Oh, perfect, I just stepped on a condom.\\
217 - (techno music blasting)\\
218 - Go ahead, have a good time.\\
219 - Hold it.\\
220 - We're with them.\\
221 - I don't think so.\\
222 - No, no, we are. Although truth be told,\\
223 - I don't see a long-term relationship in the offing.\\
224 - You understand.\\
225 - Don't touch the rope.\\
226 - Sorry.\\
227 - I didn't realize you were king of the rope.\\
228 - (softly): Shut up, Alan.\\
229 - Look, if you're not on the list,\\
230 - you're not getting in.\\
231 - You let the girls in.\\
232 - Alan. He let the girls in.\\
233 - That's because pretty girls dress up the place.\\
234 - Watch how this works.\\
235 - Listen...\\
236 - why don't you check your list for Jackson.\\
237 - Andrew Jackson.\\
238 - Nope.\\
239 - Got Tito and LaToya.\\
240 - Okay.\\
241 - What if I change my name to...\\
242 - Ulysses S. Grant?\\
243 - You can change your name to Condoleezza Rice.\\
244 - If you're not on the list and you're not a celebrity,\\
245 - you're not getting in.\\
246 - All right, look,\\
247 - I didn't want to have to play this card,\\
248 - but I'm Charlie Harper.\\
249 - I'm in the music business.\\
250 - I wrote the Maple Loops jingle.\\
251 - Granny's Big Fudge Nuggets?\\
252 - Oh, I love those cookies.\\
253 - Great.\\
254 - You got any on you?\\
255 - No. Beat it.\\
256 - Charlie, let me handle this.\\
257 - Sir...\\
258 - I am Matthew Broderick.\\
259 - Who?\\
260 - Bruno, they're with me.\\
261 - Are you sure?\\
262 - This is a good chance to cut 'em loose.\\
263 - Guys, come on.\\
264 - Matthew Broderick is a gifted actor\\
265 - and the toast of Broadway.\\
266 - Oh, for God's sake, will you stop complaining?\\
267 - Well, I'm sorry, but the music in that club\\
268 - was so loud, my ears are still ringing.\\
269 - * Ah...\\
270 - You know what that sound is?\\
271 - That is the sound of the little hairs in my middle ear dying.\\
272 - * Ah...\\
273 - I am talking permanent hearing loss, Charlie.\\
274 - Those little hairs don't grow back.\\
275 - * Ah...\\
276 - Oh, wait, let's see something.\\
277 - * Ah...\\
278 - (playing notes)\\
279 - * Ah.... C-Sharp...\\
280 - * C-Sharp is the sound of encroaching deafness. *\\
281 - Listen to you; you're like an old man.\\
282 - I can't listen to me.\\
283 - All I hear is... * Ah...\\
284 - Worst night of my life.\\
285 - You're just ticked off because you couldn't keep up.\\
286 - I couldn't keep up?\\
287 - I was out on the dance floor with the girls\\
288 - while you were sleeping in the booth.\\
289 - I wasn't sleeping.\\
290 - I was closing my eyes,\\
291 - because I couldn't bear to watch you do this.\\
292 - I was voguing.\\
293 - You were napping.\\
294 - Nobody vogues anymore, Alan.\\
295 - And guess what?\\
296 - Nobody does the robot anymore, either.\\
297 - Oh, yeah?\\
298 - Then why did it catch on with the other dancers?\\
299 - It didn't catch on.\\
300 - They were openly mocking you.\\
301 - What do you want from me?\\
302 - I went out to the club, I went to the after-hours club,\\
303 - I went out to breakfast,\\
304 - I held my date's hair\\
305 - while she vomited pancakes in the parking lot.\\
306 - Well, if you weren't whining about wanting to go home,\\
307 - you'd be having sex with her right now.\\
308 - Oh, darn. What man doesn't dream of kissing second-hand pancakes?\\
309 - And I have to go to work.\\
310 - You know what?\\
311 - You are a fuddy-duddy.\\
312 - I'm... I'm a fuddy-duddy?\\
313 - Hey, if the orthopedic shoe fits, wear it.\\
314 - They are not orthopedic.\\
315 - They merely have a reinforced arch for the active lifestyle.\\
316 - And you were napping.\\
317 - Okay, maybe I needed a little shut-eye.\\
318 - But that's only because I had vigorous sex earlier.\\
319 - Oh, let's face it.\\
320 - We're both too old for the MTV lifestyle.\\
321 - MTV?\\
322 - Did they just defrost you?\\
323 - Okay... MTV, VH-1, whatever the kids are watching.\\
324 - My point is,\\
325 - I am comfortable acting my age,\\
326 - while you are in deep denial.\\
327 - Hey, hey, I am not in denial about anything.\\
328 - I am a young, vibrant man in the prime of my life.\\
329 - I-- (coughs)\\
330 - (spits)\\
331 - What?\\
332 - Young people have phlegm, too.\\
333 - Sure.\\
334 - Anyway...\\
335 - as I was...\\
336 - Oh, God.\\
337 - What's the matter?\\
338 - My chest.\\
339 - Are you okay?\\
340 - I don't know...\\
341 - Hey, Alan...\\
342 - Yeah?\\
343 - Do you think it's too late to start jogging?\\
344 - ALAN: Damn it, what kind of hospital is this?!\\
345 - Where the hell are the doctors?\\
346 - That's my brother in there!\\
347 - If he dies, I'm homeless!\\
348 - Uh, everything's fine.\\
349 - They're just going to run some tests.\\
350 - Not to worry.\\
351 - Easy for you to say.\\
352 - Listen, Alan, if I don't make it,\\
353 - you need to know about my will.\\
354 - Hey, I don't want to hear that kind of talk.\\
355 - You're going to make it.\\
356 - But go on, finish what you were saying.\\
357 - First of all,\\
358 - I left the house to you and Jake.\\
359 - Yes!\\
360 - You're going to make it.\\
361 - Just so you know, there's two mortgages on it\\
362 - and the property taxes are $50,000 a year.\\
363 - Really? $50,000?\\
364 - (whistles)\\
365 - Uh, excuse me.\\
366 - Do you got to flat line\\
367 - to get a little help around here?!\\
368 - Do you got to move\\
369 - to Canada to get some decent medical care?!\\
370 - Uh, they'll be right here.\\
371 - So, uh... 50 grand, huh?\\
372 - Boy, I don't know...\\
373 - how I could afford that.\\
374 - You know, unless I came into some money, you know.\\
375 - An inheritance or something.\\
376 - There's no money, Alan.\\
377 - None?\\
378 - The whole thing's a house of cards.\\
379 - Huh.\\
380 - Okay, I did not want to have to do this.\\
381 - But I am Matthew Broderick.\\
382 - And that is my brother lying there.\\
383 - MAN: I'm so sorry, Mr. Broderick.\\
384 - I loved you in The Producers.\\
385 - Thank you.\\
386 - Okay, let's have a look-see, huh?\\
387 - According to your tests,\\
388 - you just had an acute attack of indigestion.\\
389 - (sighs)\\
390 - It was gas?\\
391 - Yes, a big bubble, about the size of a pomegranate.\\
392 - What have you had to eat recently?\\
393 - Nothing much.\\
394 - He had Belgian waffles, link sausages, two Red Bulls,\\
395 - a quart of scotch\\
396 - and the tongue of a 24-year-old actress.\\
397 - He asked what I ate, Alan.\\
398 - And I told him, Charlie.\\
399 - Oh-ho, you're a dirty bird.\\
400 - Well, the good news is that you\\
401 - are a perfectly healthy 50-year-old man.\\
402 - I'm only 40.\\
403 - Tell that to your liver.\\
404 - I recommend you slow down a bit.\\
405 - I've been saying the same thing.\\
406 - And you...\\
407 - Why no sequel to Ferris Bueller, huh?\\
408 - I wait and I wait.\\
409 - I'm sorry; I'll get on it.\\
410 - Ah. Give the people what they want.\\
411 - So, gas.\\
412 - (laughs)\\
413 - Good news, huh?\\
414 - A little embarrassing, but yeah.\\
415 - What do you have to be embarrassed about?\\
416 - Oh, I don't know-- the paramedics, the ambulance,\\
417 - the crying and the last-minute negotiations with God.\\
418 - Oh, right.\\
419 - Are you still planning on teaching piano to orphans?\\
420 - If any show up, sure.\\
421 - Well, will you at least accept the fact\\
422 - that you have to slow down?\\
423 - Yeah, yeah.\\
424 - It's weird, Alan.\\
425 - It seems like just yesterday I could... I could party all night\\
426 - and eat and drink anything I wanted to.\\
427 - Now a couple of Red Bulls and a waffle,\\
428 - and I'm sitting in the emergency room praying for a fart.\\
429 - Now you know why I ordered tomato juice and cottage cheese.\\
430 - I got to admit, you do take good care of yourself.\\
431 - I try.\\
432 - I guess that's why I keep you around.\\
433 - Because I'm a good example?\\
434 - No, you clod, spare parts.\\
435 - * Men...\\
436 - What are we watching?\\
437 - Antiques Roadshow.\\
438 - This woman thinks she has\\
439 - Martha Washington's butter churn.\\
440 - Toaster pizza?\\
441 - Thank you.\\
442 - So, you going out tonight?\\
443 - Eh, what's the point?\\
444 - Look, Charlie, I'm glad you're slowing down a bit,\\
445 - but you haven't been out of the house in a week.\\
446 - Eh, it's too depressing.\\
447 - Wherever I go, I'm the oldest guy in the room.\\
448 - Even here.\\
449 - Hey, what would you think about getting a cat?\\
450 - Okay, that's it.\\
451 - Put some clothes on. We're going out.\\
452 - It's 9:00.\\
453 - I was going to make some kettle corn.\\
454 - Forget the corn; you're coming with me.\\
455 - Where are we going?\\
456 - You'll see.\\
457 - Can you drive?\\
458 - I don't like to drive at night.\\
459 - What the hell is this place?\\
460 - The fountain of youth.\\
461 - What?\\
462 - Follow me.\\
463 - Ooh, look, young stuff.\\
464 - Alan, you're a genius.\\
465 - Sure.\\
466 - How old are you?\\
467 - I just turned 40.\\
468 - Oh, you're a baby.\\
469 - Yeah.\\
470 - Hey, I have a little riddle for you.\\
471 - All right.\\
472 - What has multiple orgasms and hums?\\
473 - I give up.\\
474 - (humming)\\
475 - Come on, I'll show you.\\
476 - Alan...\\
477 - Alan, I'm leaving.\\
478 - And may God bless you.
\subsection {Episode 17: I Merely Slept with a Commie}
1 - ALAN: Hey, Charlie, would you see who that is?!\\
2 - It's Death!\\
3 - ALAN: Hi, Mom!\\
4 - Your gardener left this in the driveway.\\
5 - It wasn't a gardener, it was a girl with a grudge.\\
6 - So how was your friend's funeral?\\
7 - Oh! Terribly disappointing.\\
8 - Yeah, in my experience,\\
9 - nothing kills a party like a dead broad in a box.\\
10 - Don't be glib, Charlie.\\
11 - Hello, Alan.\\
12 - Oh, hey, Mom.\\
13 - Wow, you look nice.\\
14 - Yes, mourning becomes me, doesn't it?\\
15 - If only more of my friends would die.\\
16 - I'm sure the feeling's mutual.\\
17 - Charlie, as long as you're over there,\\
18 - make Mommy a drink.\\
19 - It's been a very depressing afternoon.\\
20 - Thanks for spreading it around.\\
21 - Can you believe, two of Cynthia's three children\\
22 - didn't even bother showing up at her funeral?\\
23 - And the one who did was drunk and cracking tasteless jokes\\
24 - about his mother all throughout the service.\\
25 - You didn't happen to jot any of them down, did you?\\
26 - And it wasn't just the children.\\
27 - The crowd was very sparse\\
28 - and there was virtually no mourning.\\
29 - Well, that's understandable, isn't it?\\
30 - You said no one really liked this woman.\\
31 - Oh, she was a hateful shrew, but still.\\
32 - Fortunately,\\
33 - I was able to draw on my theater background\\
34 - and work up a good cry.\\
35 - Sense-memory.\\
36 - I remember the time\\
37 - I wasn't cast as Blanche Dubois in Streetcar.\\
38 - You're a good friend, Mom.\\
39 - I know. I'm just glad that when my time comes,\\
40 - I won't have such a humiliating sendoff.\\
41 - Right?\\
42 - Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. Of course.\\
43 - Well, I'm going to go freshen up.\\
44 - Even fake tears can ruin one's mascara.\\
45 - Speaking of which,\\
46 - whoever did Cynthia's makeup should be shot\\
47 - and buried beside her.\\
48 - She looked like a varnished clown.\\
49 - You'll go to Mom's funeral, won't you?\\
50 - Of course. As the eldest son,\\
51 - it's my obligation to pound in the stake.\\
52 - Typical-- nothing for Alan to do.\\
53 - Okay, you can cut off her head\\
54 - and hold it up for the villagers.\\
55 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
56 - * Ah, ah. * Men. *\\
57 - Leaving before Mom gets out of the bathroom.\\
58 - I thought we were taking her to dinner.\\
59 - I can't listen to her anymore.\\
60 - It just blows my mind that she can go on and on\\
61 - about her toxic friend's sad little funeral\\
62 - when we both know she's going to end up exactly the same way!\\
63 - I don't disagree,\\
64 - but there's an option to running away from her.\\
65 - Yeah, but we'd get caught\\
66 - and you'd sell me out for a reduced sentence.\\
67 - We could tell her the truth;\\
68 - that she's just as toxic as her late friend\\
69 - and that that's the way she's gonna be remembered.\\
70 - Are you on crack?\\
71 - Maybe if she realized how people see her,\\
72 - she might make an effort to change.\\
73 - If she realized how people see her,\\
74 - she'd just get new people.\\
75 - What are we gonna say, Alan?\\
76 - "Hey, Mom, you're a crazy she-bat\\
77 - "and the only way people will come to your funeral\\
78 - "is if your delighted sons\\
79 - "turn it into a three-day beer bash\\
80 - with go-go dancers."\\
81 - Well, we wouldn't start there.\\
82 - All right, Cynthia's in the ground, my face is on,\\
83 - I look stunning in black; let's go to dinner.\\
84 - Just follow my lead.\\
85 - Um, Mom...?\\
86 - Yes, dear.\\
87 - Alan thinks you're a crazy she-bat\\
88 - and no one will mourn at your funeral either.\\
89 - We're telling you this because we love you.\\
90 - I see.\\
91 - Look, Mom, you have to realize\\
92 - that you're not that different from Cynthia.\\
93 - I most certainly am!\\
94 - Come on, Mom, you speak ill of everyone,\\
95 - even your closest friends.\\
96 - You, you manipulate people,\\
97 - you're an unbelievable narcissist,\\
98 - you're self-obsessed...\\
99 - That's a bit redundant, isn't it?\\
100 - You find fault with everything,\\
101 - ...and frankly, I don't know anyone\\
102 - who enjoys spending time with you,\\
103 - let alone would cry at your funeral.\\
104 - That's one point of view.\\
105 - Charlie,\\
106 - I notice you haven't said anything.\\
107 - Actually, "crazy she-bat" was mine.\\
108 - Again, Mom, we're only telling you this\\
109 - because we care about you, right, Charlie?\\
110 - We care about you.\\
111 - And, and it's not too late for you to change\\
112 - and become the kind of person that people\\
113 - would dearly miss.\\
114 - When you're dead.\\
115 - You've given me a lot to think about.\\
116 - Yes, and, and while you're thinking, remember the spirit\\
117 - in which it was intended.\\
118 - Oh, I won't forget that.\\
119 - Good, good.\\
120 - Listen, um, I think I'm gonna beg off dinner tonight.\\
121 - Good, good. Aw...\\
122 - Good-bye, boys.\\
123 - Bye-bye. Bye.\\
124 - Okay.\\
125 - "Okay"?\\
126 - What's okay? What do you see that's okay?\\
127 - Well, we got out of dinner.\\
128 - Yes, but at what cost?\\
129 - Sure, her feelings are hurt right now,\\
130 - but that'll pass in time,\\
131 - and then she'll see this\\
132 - as an opportunity to grow and change.\\
133 - Do you actually believe that?\\
134 - I have to, Charlie.\\
135 - I have to.\\
136 - * Men. *\\
137 - Yo, mad props on the sandwich, Dad.\\
138 - This PB and J is off the hook.\\
139 - Excuse me?\\
140 - He's been watching MTV Cribs.\\
141 - The kid's a sponge.\\
142 - For shizzle, my dizzle.\\
143 - Hey, MC Skidmark.\\
144 - Here's something else you left in your pants.\\
145 - Oh, right, I was supposed to mail this.\\
146 - What is it? It's a birthday card\\
147 - Mom gave me to send to Grandma.\\
148 - Oh, God! Today's Mom's birthday.\\
149 - You forgot Mom's birthday?\\
150 - Did you remember it?\\
151 - Hey, hey, no one expects me to remember anything.\\
152 - When's the last time you talked to her?\\
153 - I don't know; probably when we told her\\
154 - she's a horrible person and nobody likes her.\\
155 - Oh, yeah, that was a fun day.\\
156 - I guess I could save this for next year.\\
157 - No, no, no, you'll give it to her in person.\\
158 - We'll go out, we'll buy her a present,\\
159 - and then we'll bring it to her.\\
160 - Gee, Alan, she hasn't talked to us in weeks.\\
161 - Don't you think showing up with a gift my jeopardize that?\\
162 - We have to go. If we don't show up,\\
163 - we'll never hear the end of it.\\
164 - True dat.\\
165 - You tell 'em, Poop Dog.\\
166 - Yo, check out the bling.\\
167 - Jake, I'm not going to tell you again.\\
168 - You're a pasty white kid.\\
169 - Start acting like one.\\
170 - Fine.\\
171 - Oh, this is cool.\\
172 - It does say "Mom."\\
173 - Charlie, be serious.\\
174 - Jake, if you really want to help, try to find something\\
175 - that's more appropriate for your grandma.\\
176 - Like what?\\
177 - See if they got a grizzly bear ripping apart a salmon.\\
178 - Hi, there.\\
179 - May I help you find something?\\
180 - Oh, yeah, we're, uh, we're looking\\
181 - for a birthday gift for our mother.\\
182 - Oh, how sweet. When's her birthday?\\
183 - Today.\\
184 - Oh.\\
185 - He forgot.\\
186 - Well, um, tell me something about her.\\
187 - What does she like?\\
188 - Hurting people.\\
189 - Charlie...\\
190 - It's a little hard to answer that\\
191 - because we have a bit of a strained relationship.\\
192 - Oh, so you'd like to find a gift\\
193 - that would help bring you closer together.\\
194 - Oh, no, no. No, no, no.\\
195 - This is just your standard family obligation,\\
196 - "Here it is, Happy Birthday\\
197 - stay off our backs" kind of thing.\\
198 - But with a pretty bow.\\
199 - I see. And what is your price range?\\
200 - Uh, enough that she can't complain, but not so much\\
201 - that it's worth her while to return it.\\
202 - Exactly.\\
203 - Have you considered\\
204 - a nice perfume?\\
205 - Do you know her scent?\\
206 - Oh, actually, I don't.\\
207 - I do. You do?\\
208 - Yep. Do you carry Chanel No. 666?\\
209 - You know, I think I'm going to let the two of you\\
210 - just browse a bit more and I'll be back... maybe.\\
211 - JAKE: Great news.\\
212 - It's on sale!\\
213 - * Men. *\\
214 - (doorbell chiming)\\
215 - Now, remember, this was not a last-minute thing.\\
216 - Our plan all along was to surprise her.\\
217 - I know how to lie, Dad.\\
218 - We're not lying. We're being considerate.\\
219 - By lying.\\
220 - ALL: Happy Birthday!\\
221 - Oh, what a surprise.\\
222 - That was the plan all along.\\
223 - I don't know what to say.\\
224 - After the last time we spoke, I assumed...\\
225 - Oh, come on, Mom.\\
226 - No matter what, you're still our mother.\\
227 - Right, Charlie? You're still our mother.\\
228 - Give her her present, Jake.\\
229 - Happy Birthday.\\
230 - Thank you.\\
231 - Oh, it's heavy.\\
232 - It's just a bowl.\\
233 - I wanted to get you a bear-eating fish.\\
234 - But we got her a nice crystal bowl instead.\\
235 - So, can we come in?\\
236 - Actually, I'm having a little party.\\
237 - A party?!\\
238 - And you didn't invite us?\\
239 - Charles, if someone's not going to mourn at my funeral,\\
240 - I certainly don't want them at my birthday party.\\
241 - Then who's here?\\
242 - People who love me.\\
243 - People who care about me and accept me for who I am.\\
244 - Oh, I got to see this.\\
245 - Please come in.\\
246 - Oh, hello.\\
247 - Hi.\\
248 - Charlie, Alan, Jake, I'd like you to meet\\
249 - Roger and Philip and their son Changpu.\\
250 - These are my sons and grandson.\\
251 - Nice to meet you. Hello.\\
252 - Your mom is such an incredible woman.\\
253 - She's like the loving mother I never had.\\
254 - She's fabulous!\\
255 - We're one big happy family.\\
256 - Son of a bitch, she got new people.\\
257 - * Men. *\\
258 - Who are these guys?\\
259 - You're surprised I have friends?\\
260 - You're surprised that I'm surprised?\\
261 - Roger works in my real estate office,\\
262 - Philip does my hair and I introduced them.\\
263 - They make a lovely couple, don't they?\\
264 - CHARLIE: Yeah, I guess.\\
265 - And they adopted...\\
266 - ...Chung King?\\
267 - Changpu. Yes-- from China.\\
268 - Of course I had to help them a bit,\\
269 - you know, greasing the bureaucratic wheels.\\
270 - You bribed someone?\\
271 - Oh, don't be ridiculous.\\
272 - I merely slept with a Commie.\\
273 - Is this goose liver?\\
274 - It's quail pate with endive.\\
275 - Philip's special recipe.\\
276 - Oh, you gotta give it to me.\\
277 - I'll trade you.\\
278 - My recipe for your mother.\\
279 - Done.\\
280 - You are so lucky.\\
281 - My mother is a bitch on wheels.\\
282 - Your mother? What about my mother?\\
283 - Fine, your mother's a bitch, too.\\
284 - * Thank you.\\
285 - So do you have PlayStation or an Xbox?\\
286 - I have a cello.\\
287 - What do you play on that?\\
288 - Beethoven, Brahms, Bach, Shostakovich.\\
289 - So, no Grand Theft Auto?\\
290 - * Happy birthday to you\\
291 - * Happy birthday to you *\\
292 - * Happy birthday\\
293 - * Dear Evy * Dear Grandma\\
294 - (singing perfect harmony): * Happy birthday to you.\\
295 - My boys, my boys.\\
296 - Thank you.\\
297 - Make a wish.\\
298 - Why? You're already here.\\
299 - My wish has come true.\\
300 - Who wishes for two gay guys and a Chinese kid?\\
301 - Evy, now we have a very special present for you.\\
302 - What do you think, a bear eating a bear?\\
303 - Changpu is going to perform a cello concerto.\\
304 - He wrote it himself, in your honor.\\
305 - How marvelous.\\
306 - (speaks Chinese)\\
307 - Should I give her the card now?\\
308 - Forget about the card, Jake.\\
309 - Shh, shh, shh.\\
310 - Shampoo is gonna play.\\
311 - (plays classical music)\\
312 - Don't feel bad.\\
313 - I bet he can't burp the alphabet.\\
314 - Well, that was one of the most bizarre evenings\\
315 - I've ever spent.\\
316 - It was right up there.\\
317 - I thought it was fabulous.\\
318 - You know what's happened, don't you?\\
319 - We've been replaced.\\
320 - Fine with me.\\
321 - As long as she's got Siegfried and Roy,\\
322 - we don't have to deal with her anymore.\\
323 - Oh, it's fine with me, too.\\
324 - I just... I can't believe she conned these guys\\
325 - into thinking she's a good witch.\\
326 - Well, we know she's not.\\
327 - Damn right. You said it, sister.\\
328 - Hey, Spongebob GayPants, take a break.\\
329 - You don't think we might've been...\\
330 - wrong about Mom.\\
331 - What?!\\
332 - I'm just saying that Roger and Philip\\
333 - obviously see something in her that we don't.\\
334 - Who knows her better, us or them?\\
335 - Well, us, no question.\\
336 - But maybe there's a part of her we're missing.\\
337 - Alan, there's a part of her she's missing.\\
338 - It's called her soul.\\
339 - Snap!\\
340 - * Men. *\\
341 - Hey, Mom, how are you?\\
342 - Charlie, what a pleasant surprise.\\
343 - Oh, I was just calling to say happy birthday again\\
344 - and thanks for last night.\\
345 - It was so nice to meet Philip and Roger and...\\
346 - Shanghai.\\
347 - Changpu.\\
348 - And thank you for the lovely crystal bowl.\\
349 - Oh, good-- you like it.\\
350 - Like it? Well, I love it.\\
351 - I'm admiring it right now.\\
352 - Great. Great.\\
353 - Listen, dear, I've really got to go.\\
354 - No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, Mom.\\
355 - about that stuff that got said a couple of weeks ago.\\
356 - What's that?\\
357 - Well, I don't have any problems with you being who you are.\\
358 - That whole thing about you needing to change,\\
359 - well, that's Alan's deal.\\
360 - Oh, I knew that.\\
361 - Yeah, yeah, the thing that I love about our relationship\\
362 - is that you don't try to change me\\
363 - and I don't try to change you.\\
364 - We accept each other as, you know, incapable of changing.\\
365 - That is very sweet.\\
366 - Okay, here you go: eggs Benedict.\\
367 - My own recipe.\\
368 - Anything else?\\
369 - No, no, I guess not.\\
370 - Love you.\\
371 - You, too.\\
372 - Bye-bye.\\
373 - Who was that?\\
374 - Oh, nobody.\\
375 - Now, you said there was something important\\
376 - you wanted to talk to me about.\\
377 - Yeah, yeah.\\
378 - I was just thinking about...\\
379 - Mm, too much lemon juice in the hollandaise sauce.\\
380 - Oh, gee, I'm sorry.\\
381 - You should ask Philip for his recipe.\\
382 - I will.\\
383 - You might also ask him who cuts his hair.\\
384 - You don't have to be gay to look nice.\\
385 - I'll ask.\\
386 - Um, anyway, I just wanted to clear the air\\
387 - about a few things.\\
388 - Really? Like what?\\
389 - Well, you know, that, uh...\\
390 - that stuff that got said a couple of weeks ago.\\
391 - I just want you to know...\\
392 - it was Charlie's idea.\\
393 - Oh, I knew that.\\
394 - Yeah, I only went along because, you know,\\
395 - he's the older brother and...\\
396 - he might've been drunk.\\
397 - Well, I'm just glad one of my sons cares about me.\\
398 - I do. I love you, Mommy.\\
399 - Right back at ya.\\
400 - Now, skidaddle.\\
401 - Philip and Roger will be here any minute.\\
402 - Oh, okay.\\
403 - Oh, look, there they are.\\
404 - Philip, Roger and Changpu.\\
405 - No pictures of me or Jake?\\
406 - Sweetheart, I've been asking for a decent picture for years.\\
407 - All I've ever gotten was a school photo of Jake\\
408 - where he appeared to be sucking on his shirt.\\
409 - Oh, yeah, they served spaghetti on picture day.\\
410 - Oh, hey, you know what we should do?\\
411 - We should get together and take a nice family portrait.\\
412 - That sounds lovely.\\
413 - Great! I'll set it up! Terrific!\\
414 - Okay, bye.\\
415 - Bye-bye.\\
416 - Um, did I tell you that I love you, Mommy?\\
417 - Yes, but I never tire of hearing it.\\
418 - Oh, well, in that case, uh, I love you, Mommy.\\
419 - I really should have stopped drinking during pregnancy.\\
420 - * Men. *\\
421 - Hello?\\
422 - Hello.\\
423 - Hey, Alan?\\
424 - Yeah?\\
425 - I couldn't help noticing\\
426 - there's a photographer in the living room.\\
427 - Oh. Yeah, we're, uh...\\
428 - we're taking a family picture.\\
429 - Family picture?\\
430 - Would it be rude of me to point out\\
431 - the obvious flaw in your plan?\\
432 - I didn't think you'd be interested.\\
433 - I'm not.\\
434 - So, it's just you and Little Lord Scratch 'n' Sniff?\\
435 - Hey, if you don't sniff it,\\
436 - you don't know what it is.\\
437 - Actually, it's a picture of me, Jake and Mom.\\
438 - Mom?!\\
439 - Mom who?\\
440 - She said she didn't have any good pictures of us.\\
441 - Wait a minute. When did you talk to Mom?\\
442 - I...\\
443 - She called me.\\
444 - You've been sucking up to her behind my back, haven't you?\\
445 - Charlie, you have no idea how insane that sounds.\\
446 - All I know is after everything that's happened,\\
447 - I would never talk to her without talking to you first.\\
448 - You wouldn't?\\
449 - What kind of person do you take me for?\\
450 - I'd rather cut off my arm\\
451 - than pick up the phone and try to undermine my own brother.\\
452 - Me, too.\\
453 - That's why I'm...\\
454 - taking a bullet here for the both of us.\\
455 - Oh.\\
456 - Well, thanks.\\
457 - You don't have to thank me...\\
458 - I'm your brother.\\
459 - (doorbell rings)\\
460 - Ooh, Mommy's here.\\
461 - Might as well get this over with.\\
462 - Wait a sec, hang on.\\
463 - Let me go change.\\
464 - You actually want to be in the picture?\\
465 - No, no, no, are you kidding?\\
466 - It's not fair for you to have to do it alone.\\
467 - Oh... well, thanks.\\
468 - You don't have to thank me.\\
469 - I'm your brother.\\
470 - Hi, Mom. Hello, dear.\\
471 - Hey, Mom, how are you? Good to see you.\\
472 - Hi, Charlie.\\
473 - Oh, what a marvelous house.\\
474 - PHILIP: It's adorable.\\
475 - Mom?\\
476 - You said you wanted a family portrait.\\
477 - They're family.\\
478 - Okay, well, I'm going back to bed.\\
479 - Wait, Charlie, what about the picture?\\
480 - Put me down for a wallet size.\\
481 - I just love what you're wearing.\\
482 - (playing classical music)\\
483 - ("Smoke on the Water" plays)\\
484 - Like that?\\
485 - Yeah, but what was all that crap in the beginning?\\
486 - It was an introduction of my own composition.\\
487 - Well, no offense, but "Smoke on the Water"\\
488 - doesn't begin with crap on the water.\\
489 - My apologies.\\
490 - Okay, let's take it from the top.\\
491 - One, two, three, four.\\
492 - (playing "Smoke on the Water")\\
493 - The playdate was a good idea.\\
494 - Yeah, let's see how Grandma likes her prodigy\\
495 - after he sponges up our sponge.\\

14 - we'll just have to... take a stab at it."\\
15 - That's it.\\
16 - (light applauding)\\
17 - So, you think I'll get the part?\\
18 - Uh, well, I for one totally buy you\\
19 - as a brilliant forensic investigator.\\
20 - Thanks, but I believe it's pronounced "fornesic."\\
21 - What do you think, Charlie?\\
22 - Unbelievable.\\
23 - Aw...\\
24 - I mean... beyond belief.\\
25 - That's sweet.\\
26 - I mean... I just don't believe it.\\
27 - You made your point, Charlie.\\
28 - Do you like what I did with the glasses?\\
29 - On, smart...\\
30 - off, hot.\\
31 - My mind is just completely blown.\\
32 - So when are you gonna be on TV?\\
33 - I have to pass the audition first.\\
34 - Let's not put the cart before the whores.\\
35 - Horse.\\
36 - (clears throat): Maybe a little.\\
37 - I've been rehearsing all day.\\
38 - (makes exploding noise)\\
39 - What's the name of the show?\\
40 - Stiffs.\\
41 - Stiffs?\\
42 - You know, like dead bodies.\\
43 - Oh, right. Sure.\\
44 - I know what you were thinking.\\
45 - Well, I better go.\\
46 - The audition's at 4:00\\
47 - and I still have to get my tan sprayed on.\\
48 - Best of luck.\\
49 - It has nothing to do with luck, Alan.\\
50 - You just have to stand still\\
51 - and keep your eyes and mouth closed.\\
52 - No, I meant...\\
53 - Never mind.\\
54 - Knock 'em dead at the audition. Thanks.\\
55 - And thanks for lending me your chiropractor coat.\\
56 - It makes me feel like a real doctor.\\
57 - Now you know why Alan wears it.\\
58 - Okay, well, uh, tell me how it goes.\\
59 - I will.\\
60 - Oh, and by the way.\\
61 - Did you get the divorce papers?\\
62 - Not really, but my lawyer explained them to me. Bye.\\
63 - The-They need to be signed.\\
64 - Kandi?\\
65 - (engine starts)\\
66 - (vehicle departs)\\
67 - Hey, what's your hurry?\\
68 - If she becomes a big TV star while you're still married,\\
69 - she'll have to pay you alimony.\\
70 - Yeah, and if pigs start flying out of my rear end,\\
71 - we'll have free bacon for the rest of our lives.\\
72 - I don't know that I'd eat that bacon.\\
73 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
74 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
75 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
76 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
77 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
78 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
79 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
80 - (knocking)\\
81 - (knocking)\\
82 - (knocking continues)\\
83 - Isn't anybody gonna get that?\\
84 - Jake?\\
85 - Yeah?\\
86 - (knocking) What are you doing?\\
87 - Hanging posters.\\
88 - Did you consider using scotch tape?\\
89 - It doesn't hold as well. Especially her.\\
90 - Who is that?\\
91 - Raven.\\
92 - She's the North American ladies' wrestling champ.\\
93 - Aha.\\
94 - All oiled up and ready to... wrestle.\\
95 - (knocking)\\
96 - Damn it! This isn't funny!\\
97 - Quick little bastards.\\
98 - What happened to your Harry Potter posters?\\
99 - I'm not a kid anymore, Dad.\\
100 - You don't have to be a kid to like Harry Potter.\\
101 - You want it, take it.\\
102 - Aw, Harry. You crumpled Harry.\\
103 - You remember when we got this? No.\\
104 - Oh, come on, we stood on line\\
105 - outside that bookstore at midnight\\
106 - to get one of the first copies?\\
107 - You were dressed as Harry and I was dressed as Dumbledore.\\
108 - I don't remember, Dad.\\
109 - Sure you do.\\
110 - You made fun of that other kid 'cause he had\\
111 - a flying mop instead of a broom, and, uh,\\
112 - he started crying and his father punched me in the chest?\\
113 - No.\\
114 - Yeah, well, you weren't the one with the cracked rib.\\
115 - Anyway, what, uh, what prompted you to...\\
116 - redecorate like this?\\
117 - I don't know, I like cars and wrestling.\\
118 - And wet T-shirts, apparently.\\
119 - Oh, there is a wet T-shirt on that-- I hadn't noticed.\\
120 - (knocking)\\
121 - Ha!\\
122 - Jake's redecorating.\\
123 - Yeah, I can see that.\\
124 - Oh, Raven.\\
125 - Those are fake, by the way.\\
126 - Charlie!\\
127 - What? He has a right to know.\\
128 - I'm just glad the little guy's got me to...\\
129 - Wait a minute.\\
130 - Are those nails in my wall?\\
131 - Are you out of your freakin' mind?\\
132 - No.\\
133 - No? That's your answer? No?\\
134 - Yeah.\\
135 - Charlie... Charlie, come on.\\
136 - For God's sake!\\
137 - These are railroad spikes!\\
138 - I'll putty over it.\\
139 - That's not plaster board, that's stucco.\\
140 - You can't just putty stucco.\\
141 - I know, I'll fix it.\\
142 - Let's just give him some privacy.\\
143 - Wait, wait, wait.\\
144 - At least I can take one hammer out of his hand.\\
145 - * Men... *\\
146 - ALAN (on TV): Jake, look at Daddy.\\
147 - Look at Daddy. Look at Daddy.\\
148 - Ah, that's my boy.\\
149 - Where's Daddy?\\
150 - Daddy's over here.\\
151 - Wasn't he adorable?\\
152 - Yeah.\\
153 - Hey, could you rewind to Judith breast-feeding him?\\
154 - That was really adorable.\\
155 - Especially the part\\
156 - where she does the old switcheroo.\\
157 - (baby Jake babbling)\\
158 - I miss that little boy.\\
159 - Seems like only yesterday I could hold him in one arm.\\
160 - He didn't weigh more than eight or nine pounds.\\
161 - He craps more than that now.\\
162 - Where did the time go?\\
163 - His childhood is almost over\\
164 - and there's still so much stuff I want to do with him.\\
165 - Like what?\\
166 - You know, father-son stuff.\\
167 - Pretty soon, there'll be no more playing catch\\
168 - or riding bikes.\\
169 - Do you realize I've never even taken him\\
170 - fishing or camping or hunting?\\
171 - Do you know how to fish or camp or hunt?\\
172 - That's not the point.\\
173 - I-I-I thought we would learn together.\\
174 - Oh, that sounds good.\\
175 - You and knucklehead out in the woods\\
176 - taking turns shooting each other in the ass.\\
177 - Okay, it's not so much about hunting, per se.\\
178 - "Per se." There's an outdoorsy phrase.\\
179 - It's about bonding.\\
180 - Before you know it,\\
181 - he'll have no interest in spending time with me at all.\\
182 - Not unless you grow boobs and straddle a Harley.\\
183 - All right, look.\\
184 - It doesn't help to whine about it.\\
185 - If you want to get lost in the woods\\
186 - with Jerky Gherkinheimer, go do it.\\
187 - My life is just one big joke to you, isn't it?\\
188 - Actually, it's more of a limerick.\\
189 - There once was a moron named Al,\\
190 - who wanted to camp with his pal...\\
191 - Any chance you can go camping in Nantucket?\\
192 - So, Charlie,\\
193 - where's the wife and kid?\\
194 - They went camping to do some father-son bonding.\\
195 - (thunder booms)\\
196 - (all laughing)\\
197 - (wind whistling)\\
198 - (thunder rumbling)\\
199 - ALAN: And when they looked at the door handle of the car,\\
200 - there was nothing there...\\
201 - but a hook.\\
202 - A hook?\\
203 - That makes no sense.\\
204 - Oh, I left out a part.\\
205 - Um, uh, okay, the guy who escaped\\
206 - from the insane asylum had lost his hand\\
207 - in some kind of an industrial accident.\\
208 - Anyway, they replaced it with a sharp metal hook.\\
209 - And it was said hook that was stuck\\
210 - on the aforementioned door handle.\\
211 - (creepy voice): Ooh...\\
212 - Dad, over the past three birthdays\\
213 - I've gotten $175 in bookstore gift cards.\\
214 - They're yours if we can just go home.\\
215 - No, no, we're having fun.\\
216 - Hey, I know-- we'll sing a song.\\
217 - * On top of spaghetti\\
218 - * All covered with cheese\\
219 - Come on, you used to love this one.\\
220 - * I lost my poor meatball\\
221 - * When somebody sneezed\\
222 - (thunder booms)\\
223 - * It rolled off the table\\
224 - * And... onto the floor\\
225 - Come on!\\
226 - * And then my poor meatball\\
227 - * Rolled right out the door.\\
228 - * Men... *\\
229 - Dad...\\
230 - Yeah, buddy?\\
231 - Bite me.\\
232 - You'll see.\\
233 - Someday you and and I will look back on this weekend\\
234 - and laugh and laugh...\\
235 - I didn't say someday soon.\\
236 - Hey, come on.\\
237 - I thought you liked wet T-shirts.\\
238 - Hey.\\
239 - Hey.\\
240 - Shut up.\\
241 - Oh, come on, Alan.\\
242 - We both know I can't do that.\\
243 - What do you want me to say,\\
244 - that it was a bad idea?\\
245 - Okay, it was a bad idea.\\
246 - And the only thing we bonded over was our mutual discomfort\\
247 - with pooping into a coffee can.\\
248 - It wasn't Chock Full O' Nuts, was it?\\
249 - Sorry, sorry. Where's Jake?\\
250 - He went back to his friends in Hooterville.\\
251 - Well, I can't blame him.\\
252 - It never rains in Hooterville.\\
253 - Look, Alan, seriously,\\
254 - I'm, I'm sorry it didn't work out.\\
255 - I know your heart was in the right place.\\
256 - Thank you.\\
257 - Now, I finished the limerick. You want to hear it?\\
258 - Too soon?\\
259 - You don't get it.\\
260 - You don't understand what it's like\\
261 - to be a little boy's best friend,\\
262 - to be someone he looks up to, and then one day you turn around\\
263 - and the only person he looks up to is covered with baby oil\\
264 - and nailed to the ceiling.\\
265 - Count your blessings.\\
266 - There's all kinds of pictures that could have been up there.\\
267 - Yeah, I guess.\\
268 - It could have been the Moscow Ballet.\\
269 - I got it. Still,\\
270 - I can't help but feel a little empty inside,\\
271 - like, like a chapter of my life is over.\\
272 - So? You've still got plenty to look forward to.\\
273 - You mean, besides work, loneliness and death?\\
274 - Absolutely.\\
275 - There's memory loss...\\
276 - impotence, adult diapers.\\
277 - I'm all you've got, pal.\\
278 - That's true.\\
279 - My wives are gone, my son is grown,\\
280 - but I'll always have you...\\
281 - my brother.\\
282 - Forever.\\
283 - Okay, now, I was just having fun, but that was mean.\\
284 - * Men.\\
285 - Well, when will he be back?\\
286 - All right, tell him I called again.\\
287 - Boy, some agent.\\
288 - He never calls,\\
289 - he never returns my calls.\\
290 - I'm almost sorry I let him feel me up.\\
291 - I guess that's showbiz.\\
292 - That's what he said.\\
293 - Uh, listen, Kandi...\\
294 - I really thought they liked me at that audition.\\
295 - They had me read three times, and then all the jumping jacks.\\
296 - Jumping jacks?\\
297 - It's an action series, Alan.\\
298 - They need to know that I'm fit.\\
299 - Ah. Uh, listen, Kandi, there's something I wanted\\
300 - to talk to you about.\\
301 - If it's about the divorce papers\\
302 - I haven't signed them yet.\\
303 - No, no, that's not why I'm here.\\
304 - Um, sweetie, do you remember why we split up?\\
305 - The big reason or all the little reasons?\\
306 - The big one.\\
307 - 'Cause there were a lot of little reasons, Alan.\\
308 - I know.\\
309 - Like the way your toenails grow all crazy.\\
310 - Right.\\
311 - And your ear hair and your nose hair.\\
312 - Got it.\\
313 - And that one long hair on your back, yuck!\\
314 - Wait, forget the little reasons.\\
315 - Just, just the big one.\\
316 - Yeah, you didn't want to have a baby, and I did.\\
317 - Right. Well, what would you say if I were to tell you that\\
318 - I've changed my mind about that?\\
319 - Really?\\
320 - Yeah, I've just been thinking that Jake is almost grown\\
321 - and there's still a lot of daddy left in me.\\
322 - So you want to have a baby?\\
323 - Yes, I do.\\
324 - A fresh start, a-a-a new chapter.\\
325 - Wow, that's a big step.\\
326 - Yeah, I know. I know it is.\\
327 - So if you want to think about it...\\
328 - No, that's okay. Let's make a baby.\\
329 - Just like that?\\
330 - Don't you want to talk about it some more?\\
331 - Alan, it's practically all we talked about\\
332 - our entire marriage.\\
333 - Baby, baby, toenails, baby, ear hair, baby,\\
334 - how clocks work, baby.\\
335 - (chuckles)\\
336 - So... so you really want to do this?\\
337 - Do what?\\
338 - You see, if you use tape,\\
339 - it's much easier to rotate in new posters\\
340 - when these ones stop working for you.\\
341 - I don't think that's gonna happen.\\
342 - Trust me. After a while, these beautiful eyes\\
343 - are gonna be filled with judgment and condemnation.\\
344 - What are you talking about?\\
345 - Okay, maybe that was just me.\\
346 - Anyway, you're lucky\\
347 - your dad lets you hang posters like this.\\
348 - I guess.\\
349 - Does your mother let you?\\
350 - No way.\\
351 - So what do you got at her house,\\
352 - a secret stash of magazines?\\
353 - Just one. Playboy 1998, the Christmas issue.\\
354 - God bless Hugh Hefner, huh?\\
355 - God bless Kimberly Macadoo from Portland, Oregon\\
356 - born March 4, 1979.\\
357 - Turn-ons: sunshine and goatees.\\
358 - Turn-offs: judgmental people and war.\\
359 - Gotta love a chick who doesn't like war.\\
360 - Tape me.\\
361 - Hey, Uncle Charlie, could you do me a favor?\\
362 - If it's the favor I'm thinking of, not until you're 18\\
363 - and not in my house.\\
364 - What?\\
365 - Nothing, nothing.\\
366 - What do you need?\\
367 - Could you get my dad to lay off the father-son stuff?\\
368 - It's kinda lame.\\
369 - Lame? You think it's lame\\
370 - your father cares so much about you\\
371 - he wants nothing more than to be part of your life?\\
372 - Yeah.\\
373 - Look, you gotta understand\\
374 - what your father's going through.\\
375 - What do you mean?\\
376 - Okay, here's the deal.\\
377 - Your father has reached a very difficult age.\\
378 - It's confusing and a little bit scary for him.\\
379 - Scary how?\\
380 - Well, first of all, his body's changing.\\
381 - Really?\\
382 - Oh, yeah. Hair is growing where it's never grown before.\\
383 - That is scary.\\
384 - And then there's the hormones. Hormones?\\
385 - Yep, your father is running out of them.\\
386 - Sounds bad.\\
387 - No, no, it's just a perfectly natural part\\
388 - of growing old, Jake.\\
389 - Is it happening to you?\\
390 - No, no, no.\\
391 - My point is that your father is going through this phase\\
392 - and you have to be patient and understanding.\\
393 - So he's gonna want to go camping again?\\
394 - Probably not in this lifetime.\\
395 - But you might have to play catch with him or something.\\
396 - Guess I could do that.\\
397 - Atta boy.\\
398 - All right, well, I'm glad we had this little talk.\\
399 - Now I'm gonna go get hammered.\\
400 - (English accent): Hello, ladies, I'm Harry Potter.\\
401 - * Men.\\
402 - Is there anything special we have to do?\\
403 - Oh, no, no. It's just like regular sex,\\
404 - but without all the last-minute fumbling for a condom.\\
405 - Oh, okay, but I still get all the rest\\
406 - of the fumbling, right?\\
407 - I prefer to call that "foreplay."\\
408 - (phone rings)\\
409 - Hold on.\\
410 - Hello.\\
411 - This is she.\\
412 - Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.\\
413 - Hold on a sec.\\
414 - Here, we're divorced.\\
415 - Okay, I'm back. You were saying?\\
416 - Really? I got the part?\\
417 - Thank you so much.\\
418 - Thank you, thank you, thank you.\\
419 - Alan, I got the part.\\
420 - Oh, that's terrific. Congratulations.\\
421 - Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
422 - Put that thing away.\\
423 - But I-I thought...\\
424 - Oh, please, nobody wants\\
425 - to see a pregnant fornesic investigator.\\
426 - Hey, can we still do it with a condom?\\
427 - * Men.\\
428 - (sportscast playing)\\
429 - It's dark out.\\
430 - Okay.\\
431 - I tried.\\
432 - Help me out here, Doc.\\
433 - I need a time of death for our little cheerleader.\\
434 - I can't give you an official T.O.D.\\
435 - until I get her on the slab.\\
436 - But based on hypostatic lividity and degree of rigor,\\
437 - I'd say our cheerleader got her pom-poms pierced\\
438 - right around halftime.\\
439 - Anything else?\\
440 - Left-handed assailant, used a single-edge blade,\\
441 - multiple entry wounds and defensive trauma.\\
442 - So how are we gonna find this psychopath?\\
443 - Well, like our killer, we'll just have to take a stab at it.\\
444 - * Mama's got a squeezebox, Daddy never sleeps at night *\\
445 - Unbelievable.\\
446 - Yeah.\\
447 - They're real, you know.\\
448 - I know, I was married to her.\\
449 - Oh, yeah.\\
450 - Dawg!\\
451 - You know what? I'll be in my room.\\
452 - When are you guys going fishing?
\subsection {Episode 19: Smooth as a Ken Doll}
1 - (keys jingling, phone rings)\\
2 - Hello.\\
3 - Oh, hey, Julia; I was just on my way over.\\
4 - Anything I need to bring?\\
5 - Thai food, wine, batteries?\\
6 - What do you mean, "Don't come"?\\
7 - (sighs)\\
8 - Gee, do you really think your psychiatrist\\
9 - is the best judge of who you should sleep with?\\
10 - Well, sure you could do better.\\
11 - We could both do better.\\
12 - But in the meantime, I am on my way over.\\
13 - Okay, okay, need to stop you here.\\
14 - There is a big difference\\
15 - between "meaningless" and "degrading."\\
16 - You know what?\\
17 - I think we just have to agree to disagree.\\
18 - Okay, then, you have a nice life, too.\\
19 - Why do these women insist on getting well?\\
20 - Hey, Alan... Hang on, Charlie.\\
21 - This is an important moment,\\
22 - and I want to savor it.\\
23 - Alan...\\
24 - J.\\
25 - Harper.\\
26 - What's the big deal? It's just an alimony check.\\
27 - Not an alimony check.\\
28 - This is my final alimony check.\\
29 - Isn't it beautiful?\\
30 - Oh, wait.\\
31 - Judith is getting married this weekend.\\
32 - Exactly.\\
33 - And you know what that means.\\
34 - You can finally kick in a few bucks around here?\\
35 - Good one. No.\\
36 - It means Alan gets new underwear.\\
37 - Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go pick up my son\\
38 - and deliver this last drop of blood money\\
39 - to the former Mrs. Alan Harper\\
40 - and soon-to-be Mrs. Herb Melnick.\\
41 - May God have mercy on his soul.\\
42 - Amen.\\
43 - So, you want some company?\\
44 - You want to come with me?\\
45 - Eh, why not? I don't have any plans.\\
46 - You got stood up again, didn't you?\\
47 - I'm starting to think all these girls\\
48 - have the same damn shrink.\\
49 - All right, well, if you're gonna come, grab your camera.\\
50 - You can take some snapshots of Pharaoh Judith\\
51 - letting her Alan go.\\
52 - Got the camera right here.\\
53 - You carry it with you?\\
54 - I thought I had a date.\\
55 - Takes video, too.\\
56 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
57 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
58 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
59 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
60 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
61 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
62 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
63 - Stopping at the copy place was a great idea.\\
64 - And the picture will make a terrific Christmas card.\\
65 - JUDITH: Want to get the door, Herb?!\\
66 - HERB: Stop yelling at me!\\
67 - I'm not yelling!\\
68 - (louder): This is yelling!\\
69 - You know what? This really isn't that funny.\\
70 - Oh, hi, Alan, Charlie.\\
71 - Herb. Hey.\\
72 - This a bad time?\\
73 - The Spanish Inquisition was a bad time.\\
74 - This is hell.\\
75 - Come in.\\
76 - So what's going on?\\
77 - A little pre- wedding jitters?\\
78 - You could call it that,\\
79 - but we'd just be sugar-coating hell.\\
80 - Oh, don't worry.\\
81 - As soon as Judith puts on that beautiful white gown\\
82 - and starts marching down that aisle...\\
83 - She doesn't want to wear white.\\
84 - Says it makes her look fat.\\
85 - Oh, well, that's nice.\\
86 - She wants to look trim and fit\\
87 - for the honeymoon.\\
88 - You're sugar-coating hell again, Alan.\\
89 - If you really want to help the guy,\\
90 - stop talking and smother him with a pillow.\\
91 - Hey.\\
92 - Hey, there's the blushing bride.\\
93 - She doesn't look fat at all.\\
94 - Go ahead. Give her the check.\\
95 - What check?\\
96 - Oh, uh, well, I-I figured as long as I was here,\\
97 - that I would give you your last and final alimony check.\\
98 - Got it.\\
99 - What the hell are you doing?\\
100 - Just a little souvenir.\\
101 - I'll go find Jake.\\
102 - See? She's being a good sport.\\
103 - Let's get one with the big check.\\
104 - Forget the big check.\\
105 - So, um, you know, um, I-I read an interesting story the other day.\\
106 - Uh, married men live, on average,\\
107 - ten years longer than single men.\\
108 - What if they don't want to?\\
109 - Come on, you and Judith were made for each other.\\
110 - What could possibly come between you?\\
111 - My sister.\\
112 - You got a sister?\\
113 - Down, Charlie.\\
114 - She came out a few days early to help with the wedding,\\
115 - but it's not really helping.\\
116 - What does she look like? Charlie!\\
117 - She doesn't have a therapist, does she?\\
118 - Charlie, I swear to God!\\
119 - So what do you think?\\
120 - Should I wear it or have a vet check it for worms?\\
121 - No, no, it looks fine.\\
122 - Oh, Myra, this is Judith's first husband, Alan.\\
123 - Hi. So how does this work?\\
124 - Do you get your original testicles back\\
125 - or does my brother give you his?\\
126 - Myra, the castration jokes are getting a little old.\\
127 - Not in my house.\\
128 - Myra, this is Alan's brother, Charlie.\\
129 - Oh, yeah, the booze- riddled sleazebag.\\
130 - She did not hear that from me.\\
131 - It's not like it's a big secret.\\
132 - JUDITH: Myra,\\
133 - where the hell is Jake?\\
134 - How should I know?\\
135 - Because I asked you to get him ready to go to his father's.\\
136 - You also asked me to try on this satin stool sample.\\
137 - Herb, tell your sister it's a lovely dress.\\
138 - Herb, tell your fianc  e the diet pills\\
139 - are affecting her judgment but not her ass.\\
140 - That's it, she's got to go.\\
141 - I can't throw out family!\\
142 - And that's the bitch of it, Herb.\\
143 - Hey, um, Charlie and I\\
144 - were thinking of taking Jake out to a movie.\\
145 - We were? We were.\\
146 - Myra, would you like to join us?\\
147 - You didn't say anything about a movie.\\
148 - I wanted to surprise you.\\
149 - Hey, you know what? That's a great idea.\\
150 - Go to a movie with Alan and Charlie.\\
151 - Can I wear my pretty new dress?\\
152 - Get her out, Herb.\\
153 - Hey, look what I found in the bushes.\\
154 - * Men...\\
155 - (sighs)\\
156 - God, I hate family movies.\\
157 - What, you don't buy the central premise\\
158 - that a dog can play hockey?\\
159 - Well, not as a power forward.\\
160 - Oh. We're flying the friendly skies, are we?\\
161 - After you.\\
162 - (smacks lips) Why, thank you.\\
163 - So, you're staying at Judith's.\\
164 - Yep.\\
165 - What does she say about me?\\
166 - Well, if she's telling the truth,\\
167 - we really shouldn't be drinking out of the same cup.\\
168 - That might be the nicest thing\\
169 - she's ever said about me.\\
170 - I just don't understand what my brother sees in her.\\
171 - You know, 15 years ago I asked the exact same question.\\
172 - A little tip?\\
173 - Don't do it during the wedding toast.\\
174 - Maybe you can clear something up for me.\\
175 - Herb says you're a successful jingle writer,\\
176 - but Judith says you are a drunken talentless hack\\
177 - who passed out and fell into a pit of money.\\
178 - So what do you need cleared up?\\
179 - (clears throat) Boy, you got me at a disadvantage.\\
180 - I don't know why Judith hates you.\\
181 - Hmm, it's hard to say.\\
182 - Maybe it's 'cause I'm smart.\\
183 - Maybe it's because I'm independent.\\
184 - Maybe it's because I offered my brother a thousand dollars\\
185 - to call off the wedding.\\
186 - I did the same thing with my brother.\\
187 - You did?\\
188 - ...but the thought was the same.\\
189 - So, Myra... what do you do?\\
190 - I teach high school economics.\\
191 - Huh.\\
192 - It may sound like a boring life,\\
193 - but at night, I dress up like a giant spider and fight crime.\\
194 - Interesting. Now, did you decide spider\\
195 - and have the costume made\\
196 - or did you find the costume and say, "Okay, spider"?\\
197 - Are you mocking the Scarlet Arachnid?\\
198 - Sorry, sorry.\\
199 - It's just hard to believe that you're Herb's sister.\\
200 - He's so...\\
201 - Hapless?\\
202 - I was going to say "tall," but hapless works.\\
203 - To hapless Herb.\\
204 - To the Scarlet Arachnid.\\
205 - Shh.\\
206 - (whispering): My enemies are everywhere.\\
207 - * Men...\\
208 - * Let's all go to the lobby, let's all go the lobby *\\
209 - * Let's all go the lobby and have ourselves a treat. *\\
210 - We're here.\\
211 - Oh, yes, Judith's house of pain.\\
212 - Shh, shh, ixnay!\\
213 - That's her id-kay.\\
214 - We're... here.\\
215 - Well, thanks for the movie.\\
216 - Wait. Wait, wait.\\
217 - I'll walk you. Why, thank you.\\
218 - CHARLIE: Whoa!\\
219 - (thud)\\
220 - MYRA: You okay?\\
221 - CHARLIE: I never know till I sober up.\\
222 - I think they like each other.\\
223 - Well, sure they like each other.\\
224 - No, I mean, they like like each other.\\
225 - (chuckles) Oh, no, Jake.\\
226 - Your Uncle Charlie only like likes\\
227 - a certain type of woman.\\
228 - Mom calls 'em tramps.\\
229 - That's as good a word as any.\\
230 - (sighs) Thanks, that was fun.\\
231 - Yeah, it was.\\
232 - See ya around.\\
233 - Yeah.\\
234 - I'm sorry. I don't know why I did that.\\
235 - Who cares?\\
236 - Looks like Aunt Myra's a tramp, huh?\\
237 - * Men...\\
238 - It's no big deal.\\
239 - That's how Charlie says good-bye.\\
240 - Some people shake hands, some people wave,\\
241 - my brother darts his tongue in and out of your mouth.\\
242 - What'd I miss?\\
243 - You know Dr. Melnick?\\
244 - Guy your mom's marrying?\\
245 - He has a sister... Got it.\\
246 - I'm sure it has nothing to do with you, Judith.\\
247 - Wait, hang on a second.\\
248 - Jake, are you done with your breakfast?\\
249 - Yeah. Then get out.\\
250 - Fine, Berta will just tell me later, right?\\
251 - Right.\\
252 - Okay, Judith, that's insane.\\
253 - Charlie would not do Myra just to piss you off.\\
254 - I don't think.\\
255 - How would I know what he sees in her?\\
256 - She got working girl parts?\\
257 - You know what?\\
258 - You leave. Send Jake back.\\
259 - Okay, okay. Fine, fine.\\
260 - I'll talk to him.\\
261 - (chuckles) I, I don't know.\\
262 - I'll, uh, I'll tell him to keep his hands off Myra.\\
263 - And then I'll tell the rain not to fall,\\
264 - the Earth not to spin and you to stop nagging me!\\
265 - Oh, boy, I'm going to pay for that.\\
266 - You know what your problem is?\\
267 - Phone cojones.\\
268 - Excuse me?\\
269 - When you're on the phone with her,\\
270 - you got boulders between your legs.\\
271 - The minute you hang up, you're as smooth as a Ken doll.\\
272 - Phone cojones.\\
273 - Good to have a name for it.\\
274 - So, tell me about the sister.\\
275 - (sighs) I don't know.\\
276 - She doesn't seem like his type at all.\\
277 - What, no coin slot in her forehead?\\
278 - Morning. Morning.\\
279 - Charlie, we need to talk about Myra.\\
280 - Yeah, that was probably a mistake.\\
281 - It was?\\
282 - She's a nice kid, but...\\
283 - she's just not, you know...\\
284 - A red-hot simpleton with no self-respect?\\
285 - I just hope she didn't take\\
286 - that whole kiss thing too seriously.\\
287 - So, you're not planning on pursuing her?\\
288 - No, no, no.\\
289 - In fact, I got a date tonight\\
290 - with a lovely sex addict whose therapist is on vacation.\\
291 - It's what we eligible bachelors\\
292 - call "a window of opportunity."\\
293 - You know, Charlie, there's a special section in hell\\
294 - reserved for people like you.\\
295 - That's good,\\
296 - 'cause I'd hate to have to stand on line.\\
297 - So I'm like, "Yeah, I can make a lot of money\\
298 - "as a lingerie model, but then who's\\
299 - gonna take me seriously as a director?"\\
300 - Good point.\\
301 - Sometimes I wish I wasn't beautiful.\\
302 - I mean, ugly people have it so easy, you know?\\
303 - I've heard.\\
304 - So, what about you? Still writing jingles?\\
305 - Just during the day.\\
306 - At night, I dress up as a big spider and fight crime.\\
307 - Huh. You know, I dated a cop once.\\
308 - Well, it wasn't so much a date\\
309 - as a way to get out of a ticket.\\
310 - Interesting.\\
311 - Okay. Here we are.\\
312 - Ah. I hope this place has fresh lobster.\\
313 - That frozen stuff is just disgusting.\\
314 - * Men...\\
315 - JUDITH: You know what, Herb?\\
316 - Forget it. I'll do it myself.\\
317 - HERB: I said I would do it-- I'll do it!\\
318 - MYRA: For God's sake, Judith, get off his back!\\
319 - JUDITH: No one's talking to you, Myra!\\
320 - HERB: Okay, everyone calm down.\\
321 - I'm doing it.\\
322 - Oh. Hi, Charlie.\\
323 - Hey, Herb.\\
324 - Just taking out the trash.\\
325 - Yeah, I'm coming from doing the same thing.\\
326 - Great. He leaves the door wide op...\\
327 - What the hell are you doing here?\\
328 - That's a good question.\\
329 - See, the thing is I...\\
330 - Oh, hey, Charlie.\\
331 - Hi, Myra.\\
332 - No. No. I forbid it.\\
333 - Not in my house.\\
334 - What brings you to the cul-de-sac of the damned?\\
335 - Just in the neighborhood.\\
336 - That's nice.\\
337 - Come on in.\\
338 - Thanks.\\
339 - I said no! Doesn't anybody listen to me?!\\
340 - I'm doing it! Look!\\
341 - You know, I really didn't expect to see you again.\\
342 - Well, I wasn't doing anything, so...\\
343 - MYRA: No, Alan, listen to me.\\
344 - He's here right now!\\
345 - Why would I kid about that?\\
346 - I don't know, maybe his other date didn't work out.\\
347 - Ah, the plot thickens.\\
348 - (sighs) Okay, okay, I can explain.\\
349 - No, I can't.\\
350 - Give it a shot.\\
351 - Well, um...\\
352 - I was with this girl, and I suddenly realized\\
353 - that I'd rather be with someone who I, you know,\\
354 - actually enjoy being with.\\
355 - Oh just forget it, Alan; you're useless.\\
356 - (hangs up phone) Herb, do something!\\
357 - Hey.\\
358 - I'm thinking about going out for ice cream.\\
359 - Anyone want to join me?\\
360 - Charlie, when's the last time you had a cone with sprinkles?\\
361 - You know what, Herb? Judith can relax.\\
362 - I'm gonna check into a hotel.\\
363 - (sighs) Myra, no.\\
364 - You don't have to do that.\\
365 - Yes, she does.\\
366 - Hey, she's my sister!\\
367 - She can stay as long as she wants!\\
368 - I really appreciate this.\\
369 - I'll go get my stuff.\\
370 - Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
371 - You don't have to stay at a hotel.\\
372 - I got plenty of room at my place.\\
373 - Yeah, I'll bet you do.\\
374 - N-N-No, no, no, no.\\
375 - No strings attached.\\
376 - Really?\\
377 - Really.\\
378 - Still, I couldn't impose like that.\\
379 - It's no imposition.\\
380 - It's a big house.\\
381 - There's plenty of room for everybody.\\
382 - You sure?\\
383 - Absolutely.\\
384 - Okay, then.\\
385 - I'll be right back.\\
386 - JUDITH: Herb!\\
387 - You want to come, too?\\
388 - Are you nuts?\\
389 - With Myra out of the house, I might get lucky tonight.\\
390 - Really?\\
391 - She seems pretty angry.\\
392 - It's better when she's angry.\\
393 - Coming, pookie!\\
394 - * Men...\\
395 - (toilet flushes)\\
396 - This just sucks.\\
397 - It's just for a couple of days till the wedding.\\
398 - Yeah, but why does she have to stay in my room?\\
399 - Because... I don't know.\\
400 - You're the kid.\\
401 - Yeah, well, it's not fair.\\
402 - Yeah, well, get over it.\\
403 - Oh, my God!\\
404 - Jake, that's disgusting.\\
405 - Yeah, well, get over it.\\
406 - Go to sleep.\\
407 - Did you brush your teeth?\\
408 - Dad, I'm asleep.\\
409 - Go brush your teeth.\\
410 - I can't; I don't have my toothbrush.\\
411 - Well, go get it.\\
412 - Man!\\
413 - I have to do everything around here.\\
414 - Aunt Myra?\\
415 - I have to get my toothbrush.\\
416 - Aunt Myra?\\
417 - Aunt Myra?\\
418 - Huh.\\
419 - (humming)\\
420 - Oh.\\
421 - Huh.\\
422 - Hi.\\
423 - Hi.\\
424 - Is everything okay?\\
425 - Everything's fine.\\
426 - I just wanted to chat.\\
427 - Oh. Okay.\\
428 - I can go if you want. No, no. No.\\
429 - No, this is fine.\\
430 - So...\\
431 - What's up?\\
432 - Well, we never really talked about that kiss last night.\\
433 - Right, right.\\
434 - That was a little out of character for me.\\
435 - Really? That's not the word on the street.\\
436 - Okay, let me explain. Um...\\
437 - With me, kissing is usually just a prelude to sex,\\
438 - but last night, sex was the last thing on my mind.\\
439 - Oh, gee, what girl doesn't like to hear that?\\
440 - No, no. No, wait, let me finish.\\
441 - I kissed you because I really liked you,\\
442 - and I wanted to express my... liking of you.\\
443 - Be still, my beating heart.\\
444 - Oh, come on, Myra.\\
445 - I drove all the way to Judith's house to see you.\\
446 - And you know what's at Judith's house?\\
447 - Judith!\\
448 - That was very brave of you.\\
449 - Oh, no, it wasn't brave, it was...\\
450 - To tell you the truth, I don't know what it was,\\
451 - and I'm not really sure what to do here.\\
452 - What do you want to do here?\\
453 - Let's forget about me for a second.\\
454 - What about you?\\
455 - What about me?\\
456 - You kissed first.\\
457 - Why'd you do that?\\
458 - Oh, I was plowed.\\
459 - Really?\\
460 - Oh, come on, you moron.\\
461 - I'm sitting in the middle of your bed\\
462 - in my sexiest lingerie.\\
463 - All right.\\
464 - I'm pretty sure I know what to do now.\\
465 - Charlie?\\
466 - Yeah?\\
467 - I don't want to put any pressure on you, but...\\
468 - I'm a virgin.\\
469 - You are?\\
470 - Man, you got to stop sleeping with dumb girls.\\
471 - It's rubbing off on you.\\
472 - * Men...\\
473 - Aunt Myra's not there.\\
474 - I'm sure she will be.\\
475 - She's probably just getting something in the kitchen.\\
476 - (bedsprings squeaking rhythmically)\\
477 - That's not the kitchen.
\subsection {Episode 20: Aunt Myra Doesn't Pee a Lot}
1 - You and Judith were meant for each other.\\
2 - What could possibly come between you?\\
3 - My sister.\\
4 - You got a sister?\\
5 - You know what, Herb? Judith can relax.\\
6 - I'm going to check into a hotel.\\
7 - Myra, no, you don't have to do that.\\
8 - Yes, she does.\\
9 - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait-- you don't have to stay at a hotel.\\
10 - I've got plenty of room at my place.\\
11 - Yeah, I'll bet you do.\\
12 - No strings attached.\\
13 - Why can't I sleep in my bed?\\
14 - Aunt Myra's not there.\\
15 - I'm sure she will be.\\
16 - She's probably just getting something in the kitchen.\\
17 - (bed springs squeaking ryhthmically)\\
18 - That's not the kitchen.\\
19 - * Men... *\\
20 - Thinking of chewing your arm off?\\
21 - What? No, no, no, why would I do that?\\
22 - I don't know, maybe because you're not horny anymore\\
23 - and you just remembered I'm staying through the weekend.\\
24 - You got all that from the twitching of my shoulder muscles?\\
25 - I have those muscles too, Charlie.\\
26 - Okay, good to know.\\
27 - Well, to be honest, I did have a momentary panic reflex,\\
28 - but it passed and I'm actually happy you're here.\\
29 - You sound surprised.\\
30 - Surprised doesn't begin to cover it.\\
31 - Normally, at this point in a relationship,\\
32 - I'm busy plotting the appropriate exit strategy.\\
33 - For example?\\
34 - Well, that would depend on whether I'm trying\\
35 - to get rid of them just for today or forever.\\
36 - Let's say today.\\
37 - Okay, today, I have to see my dermatologist\\
38 - about a little rash.\\
39 - Oh, that's good.\\
40 - All right, what about forever?\\
41 - Turns out it wasn't a rash--\\
42 - and they won't let me come home.\\
43 - Impressive.\\
44 - Thank you.\\
45 - I'm kind of a savant.\\
46 - Well, it looks like you're good at two things.\\
47 - What's the other one?\\
48 - Oh, right.\\
49 - The piano.\\
50 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
51 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
52 - Okay, I just checked--\\
53 - no one slept in my bed all night.\\
54 - It's none of your business who slept where.\\
55 - Excuse me, but if who sleeps in my bed\\
56 - is not my business, then what is?\\
57 - Let it go, Goldilocks.\\
58 - Morning.\\
59 - Morning.\\
60 - And how many times do you have to get up to go pee?\\
61 - I wasn't counting.\\
62 - I was-- four.\\
63 - Okay, one of those was to get a glass of water.\\
64 - Well, there's your problem.\\
65 - Stop topping off the tank.\\
66 - What's going on?\\
67 - I had to sleep in Dad's room last night,\\
68 - 'cause Uncle Charlie invited Aunt Myra to stay in my room, but it turns out...\\
69 - Got it.\\
70 - Well, do you think it's fair?\\
71 - Nothing about your Uncle Charlie's life is fair, kid.\\
72 - Hurry up and finish your breakfast.\\
73 - We've got to get you fitted for a tux.\\
74 - Why do I have to wear a tuxedo?\\
75 - Because your mother's getting married\\
76 - and you're in the wedding party.\\
77 - Why do I have to be in the wedding party?\\
78 - Because your mother still thinks you're cute.\\
79 - Morning.\\
80 - Morning. Morning.\\
81 - Everybody get a good night's sleep?\\
82 - No. No.\\
83 - Say, Charlie, where's this houseguest I'm hearing about?\\
84 - Uh, gee, I guess she's probably still asleep in Jake's room.\\
85 - Oh, please, you are such a liar.\\
86 - What?\\
87 - Forget it, Charlie, we know.\\
88 - You do?\\
89 - ALL: We do.\\
90 - Okay, well, I got a good night's sleep.\\
91 - Probably because Aunt Myra doesn't pee a lot.\\
92 - Can I talk to you in private?\\
93 - Come on, it's no big deal.\\
94 - I was in the middle of flossing\\
95 - and suddenly, there she is, sitting on my bed...\\
96 - Uh-uh-uh-uh.\\
97 - He doesn't need to hear this.\\
98 - Fine.\\
99 - Like I didn't hear enough last night.\\
100 - Okay, uh, let me just start\\
101 - by saying I applaud the, uh... the gusto\\
102 - with which you approach life.\\
103 - Thank you.\\
104 - Um, that being said, uh...\\
105 - are you, um, out of your frickin' mind?!\\
106 - Beg pardon?\\
107 - You just could not control yourself.\\
108 - A female's in the house-- she must be mounted.\\
109 - No, it's not like that at all.\\
110 - And why do you even care?\\
111 - Why?! You ask me why?!\\
112 - Never mind, unimportant.\\
113 - I will tell you why.\\
114 - Because every time you rut with any woman\\
115 - even remotely connected to my life,\\
116 - I end up suffering.\\
117 - Oh, that's ridiculous.\\
118 - Ridiculous you say?\\
119 - All right, all right, let's look at the record.\\
120 - Um, you slept with Judith's sister...\\
121 - Well, yeah, but...\\
122 - ...at my wedding reception!\\
123 - All right, poor timing.\\
124 - You had more sex on my wedding day than I did.\\
125 - That part's not my fault.\\
126 - Okay, okay.\\
127 - Let's jump ahead.\\
128 - Uh, when Judith was divorcing me,\\
129 - who seduced and then abandoned my lawyer,\\
130 - causing her to take revenge on me?\\
131 - Hold on, that chick was nuts.\\
132 - I lost everything.\\
133 - Well, to be fair, you didn't have that much to begin with.\\
134 - And now...\\
135 - that Judith is finally getting remarried,\\
136 - and I can see the light at the end of the alimony tunnel,\\
137 - you decide, "Hey, why don't I start humping\\
138 - her new sister-in-law?"\\
139 - That is not how it happened.\\
140 - I don't care how it happened.\\
141 - I only care how it's going to end.\\
142 - And it's going to end badly for me.\\
143 - How?\\
144 - Explain how.\\
145 - I don't know yet.\\
146 - That's always part of the fun.\\
147 - Trying to guess how your penis is going to bite me in the ass.\\
148 - Alan, you got to believe me here.\\
149 - This is different. I really like Myra.\\
150 - Oh, you like all of them.\\
151 - And then you don't.\\
152 - What's going to happen when you get tired of this poor girl...?\\
153 - Morning.\\
154 - Morning. Morning.\\
155 - Boy, I slept great.\\
156 - Jake's bed is really comfortable.\\
157 - Don't bother. He knows.\\
158 - Oh. Boy, I slept great.\\
159 - Charlie's a terrific lover.\\
160 - Oh, this one's going to be bad.\\
161 - I don't understand why I can't have the blue tuxedo.\\
162 - Because you're going to your mother's wedding,\\
163 - not hosting a game show on Telemundo.\\
164 - (Spanish accent): This from a grown man wearing a green polo shirt.\\
165 - Look, all the other men are going to be wearing black tuxedos.\\
166 - If all the other men were jumping off a bridge\\
167 - would you want me to do that, too?\\
168 - If it would keep your mother off my back, yes.\\
169 - I'll get the jacket.\\
170 - Thank you.\\
171 - Listen, this is a very big day for your mother.\\
172 - It's important that you cooperate\\
173 - and make her proud of you.\\
174 - I'm her son-- she has to be proud of me.\\
175 - You think so, huh?\\
176 - Have you met my mother?\\
177 - Oh, yeah.\\
178 - Let me explain something to you.\\
179 - A woman's wedding day is something she will remember for the rest of her life.\\
180 - So if you screw it up,\\
181 - she will never forgive you.\\
182 - Even if it were your brother's fault and that there was nothing\\
183 - you could do to prevent it short of having him fixed.\\
184 - Don't worry, Dad, it will be fine.\\
185 - Thank you.\\
186 - I don't have a brother.\\
187 - Okay, we haven't really talked about what all this means.\\
188 - What what means?\\
189 - All the big changes that are happening.\\
190 - It's just a couple of hairs, Dad.\\
191 - It's not that big a deal.\\
192 - Not-Not those changes, but...\\
193 - the wedding, I mean, you're going to have a stepdad in your life.\\
194 - So?\\
195 - So, is there anything you want to talk about?\\
196 - Do you have any questions?\\
197 - Just one.\\
198 - Yeah, buddy?\\
199 - Why can't I wear the blue tuxedo?\\
200 - * Men... *\\
201 - Jake, your dinner's getting cold.\\
202 - So, what did you guys do today?\\
203 - We went on the Universal Studios tour\\
204 - and then Charlie took me to the Hollywood Wax Museum.\\
205 - You're kidding! I thought you hated that touristy stuff.\\
206 - What gave you that idea?\\
207 - Well, whenever I ask you to go someplace like that,\\
208 - you say, "I hate that touristy stuff."\\
209 - Well, this is different.\\
210 - How? I enjoy her company.\\
211 - And it's my first trip to L.A.,\\
212 - so I want to do all the traditional stuff.\\
213 - Tomorrow, we're going to sit in rush hour traffic\\
214 - and give other drivers the finger.\\
215 - Good evening.\\
216 - Why are you wearing that?\\
217 - You said I looked great in it.\\
218 - You do, but I don't want you messing it up\\
219 - before your mom's wedding.\\
220 - I won't mess it up.\\
221 - Oh, come on, Alan, you've got to admit\\
222 - he lends a bit of class to the place.\\
223 - Thank you, my good man.\\
224 - Hey, speaking of the wedding,\\
225 - Charlie, I have a favor I'd like to ask. Sure.\\
226 - Well, I have to be there, and I was just thinking\\
227 - that the only way it is going to be any fun,\\
228 - is if you come with me.\\
229 - (choking)\\
230 - You want me to be your date at Judith's wedding?\\
231 - (loud gagging)\\
232 - Yeah.\\
233 - We'll have some laughs-- what do you say?\\
234 - (hissing)\\
235 - (clearing throat)\\
236 - I'm laughing already.\\
237 - Uh-oh.\\
238 - * Men... *\\
239 - You tell Judith if she wants me to be a bridesmaid\\
240 - and wear that brown satin turd of a dress,\\
241 - then I am entitled to bring whoever I want as a date,\\
242 - and I want Charlie!\\
243 - Okay, bye.\\
244 - See? No problem.\\
245 - (phone ringing)\\
246 - (ringing continues)\\
247 - Okay.\\
248 - Hi, Judith.\\
249 - Problem.\\
250 - Here's your suit.\\
251 - Thanks, Berta.\\
252 - The dry cleaners found $46 and a condom in the breast pocket.\\
253 - Here's the condom.\\
254 - Again, thanks.\\
255 - Can I give you some free advice?\\
256 - Free? I'm already down $46.\\
257 - What is it you always say about going to a wedding\\
258 - with a woman you're sleeping with?\\
259 - This is different, Berta.\\
260 - You say-- and I quote--\\
261 - "Better I should light myself on fire and run through a meth lab."\\
262 - Oh, that's just a figure of speech.\\
263 - Come on, Charlie, what are you doing with this girl?\\
264 - What do you mean? I mean, she's a nice kid.\\
265 - You're gonna break her heart. You don't know that.\\
266 - I know you.\\
267 - Myra's not one of your Handi Wipes in high heels\\
268 - that you can just throw out after you... wipe your handi.\\
269 - Yeah? Well, you don't know what you're talking about,\\
270 - because this relationship is not based on sex.\\
271 - Not based on sex?\\
272 - Well, unless she sweats bourbon and farts hundred-dollar bills,\\
273 - what exactly is gonna keep you together?\\
274 - JAKE: Oh, crap.\\
275 - No, Judith, you listen to me.\\
276 - If Myra wants to bring Charlie to the wedding,\\
277 - then that's her business.\\
278 - N-No. No, I will not intervene,\\
279 - and you're just gonna have to live with it. Good-bye!\\
280 - I changed my mind.\\
281 - I'm not going to the wedding.\\
282 - Ooh, thank God!\\
283 - Judith, great news.\\
284 - I talked him out of it.\\
285 - Hey. Hey.\\
286 - Whatcha doing?\\
287 - Grading tests.\\
288 - 10th grade economics? Uh-huh.\\
289 - Ask me a question.\\
290 - Okay. "The functions and implications\\
291 - of monetary policy..."\\
292 - Never mind.\\
293 - You sure? I grade on a curve.\\
294 - That's all right; I'm stupid on a straight line.\\
295 - Listen, um...\\
296 - about the wedding, uh...\\
297 - I don't... I don't think I should go.\\
298 - Okay.\\
299 - I'm just concerned\\
300 - that-that maybe we should slow things down a bit.\\
301 - What things?\\
302 - You know... things.\\
303 - I mean... you don't know me that well, and...\\
304 - I'm afraid that I might hurt you without meaning to.\\
305 - Don't worry about it.\\
306 - Okay, good. I won't.\\
307 - Exactly what is it I'm not worrying about?\\
308 - Hurting me.\\
309 - Right.\\
310 - And why am I not worrying about that?\\
311 - I'm a big girl, Charlie.\\
312 - Some might even say a woman.\\
313 - I want to go to the wedding with you.\\
314 - Don't worry about Jake-- I'll get him there in plenty of time.\\
315 - Well, you are very welcome.\\
316 - Best of luck to you and her. Bye-bye.\\
317 - I'm going to the wedding.\\
318 - * Men... *\\
319 - What is this, candle wax?\\
320 - How do you get candle wax on the seat of your pants?\\
321 - I don't know. You don't know?\\
322 - Okay, I might've lit a couple of farts.\\
323 - I'm ready. Myra's ready. Is he ready?\\
324 - Does he look ready?\\
325 - Well,\\
326 - he's not wearing any pants.\\
327 - That's ready for some things.\\
328 - Just go ahead. I'll get him there.\\
329 - Okay.\\
330 - What is that?\\
331 - Pudding.\\
332 - * Men... *\\
333 - You know what?\\
334 - I just realized something.\\
335 - I am two for two at Judith's weddings.\\
336 - What a coincidence-- I'm two for two at Herb's weddings.\\
337 - Oh. Okay.\\
338 - What about funerals?\\
339 - Can you beat a three-way in a hearse.\\
340 - No.\\
341 - You have to think about it?\\
342 - It's a gray area.\\
343 - Where have you been?\\
344 - I've been looking all over for you.\\
345 - We were having sex in the coatroom.\\
346 - Ha-ha. Good one.\\
347 - Listen, one of my groomsmen\\
348 - got food poisoning, so you're gonna have\\
349 - to walk down the aisle with Uncle Fred.\\
350 - Uncle Fred?\\
351 - Is that the only man left?\\
352 - Well, there's cousin Trudy.\\
353 - She's pre-op, but she's wearing a very nice tux.\\
354 - Why can't I just walk down the aisle with Charlie? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
355 - Whoa, I'm just an innocent bystander at this shindig.\\
356 - Oh, come on, picture the look on Judith's face\\
357 - when she sees you at the altar.\\
358 - I'm in.\\
359 - Oh, God.\\
360 - (whispers): Herb. Herb.\\
361 - Oh, hi. Hey, thanks for bringing him down.\\
362 - Well, you look very handsome, Jake.\\
363 - I know. It's the tux.\\
364 - Okay, well, uh, congratulations.\\
365 - I wish you both a lot of happiness.\\
366 - Oh, thanks, Al.\\
367 - Don't make the same mistakes I did.\\
368 - I won't-- she wrote them down for me.\\
369 - Good. All right, buddy, uh, have some fun. Okay.\\
370 - Oh. Remember, that tux is a rental.\\
371 - Excuse me.\\
372 - Are you Judith's ex-husband?\\
373 - Uh, yeah, yeah, I was just dropping off our son.\\
374 - I'm sorry, do I know you?\\
375 - Oh, no, not really, it's...\\
376 - Herb and I were engaged before he met Judith, so...\\
377 - And you're coming to his wedding?\\
378 - Yeah, well, we're still friends.\\
379 - Oh. Well, how very... California of you.\\
380 - Well, I wish him the best.\\
381 - Mm.\\
382 - I have to tell you, though, based on first impressions,\\
383 - I'm not sure that Judith is trading up.\\
384 - Oh. Thank you. (laughs)\\
385 - Uh, and having just met you, I feel safe in saying\\
386 - that Herb's not getting an upgrade, either.\\
387 - (laughs)\\
388 - (organ playing)\\
389 - Oh, man!\\
390 - Nice dress.\\
391 - Bite me.\\
392 - Okay. Meet me in the coatroom. (laughs)\\
393 - Listen, after the reception, can you take me to the airport?\\
394 - You're flying home tonight?\\
395 - Yeah.\\
396 - I thought we had something going here.\\
397 - We did, and now I'm going home.\\
398 - Okay. Maybe I can come visit you sometime.\\
399 - Ooh, I don't think my boyfriend would like that very much.\\
400 - Your boyfriend?\\
401 - He's more like a fianc  .\\
402 - You're getting married?!\\
403 - (organ playing "Wedding March")\\
404 - (whispers): Why didn't you tell me you were engaged?\\
405 - I thought it would be awkward.\\
406 - (loudly): Awkward?!\\
407 - MINISTER: You may be seated.\\
408 - Mm, ow. We-we really shouldn't be doing this.\\
409 - Why not? They broke our hearts.\\
410 - Uh, yeah, but I'm kind of over it.\\
411 - I'm not.\\
412 - Mm, mm, uh, hang on, hang on.\\
413 - Maybe we could go out for coffee first.\\
414 - Or-or a movie.\\
415 - Alan, this is gonna happen with you or without you.\\
416 - With me or...?\\
417 - How does that work?\\
418 - The institution of marriage is not one to enter lightly,\\
419 - so we pause at this time to consider the depth\\
420 - of that commitment.\\
421 - (loud clattering) WOMAN: Oh, Alan Harper, you animal!\\
422 - (clattering continues) I can't believe Judith let you go!\\
423 - Oh, God! Alan Harper! Oh, God!\\
424 - Oh, don't stop, Alan Harper!\\
425 - Please don't stop!\\
426 - Oh, Alan Harper, I feel like a woman again!\\
427 - I'm Alan Harper, and I'm not having sex!\\
428 - * Men... *\\
429 - Hey.\\
430 - Hey.\\
431 - How was the reception?\\
432 - Kind of a letdown after the ceremony.\\
433 - But you'll be happy to know your little outburst\\
434 - is already on YouTube.\\
435 - Damn camera phones.\\
436 - Boy, is Mom mad at you.\\
437 - Yeah.\\
438 - Well, she might as well start her second marriage\\
439 - the same way as the first.\\
440 - (clears throat): So...\\
441 - drinking in the dark, eh?\\
442 - It wasn't dark when I started.\\
443 - Did you get Myra to the airport?\\
444 - Yep.\\
445 - And you know what?\\
446 - I'll never see her again.\\
447 - I was just a meaningless fling to that girl.\\
448 - (groans softly)\\
449 - I'll bet this is that whole karma thing people talk about.\\
450 - Could be.\\
451 - (sighs)\\
452 - You know that feeling you get when...\\
453 - somebody's gone from your life, and you...\\
454 - you suddenly realize that you miss them?\\
455 - Yeah.\\
456 - I don't care for it.\\
457 - Hey, you know what always cheers me up?\\
458 - Pigs in a blanket.
\subsection {Episode 21: Tucked, Taped and Gorgeous}
1 - (laughs loudly)\\
2 - Oh, oh, that is so true.\\
3 - I know exactly what you mean.\\
4 - Hang on. I'll get you an ashtray.\\
5 - Oh, hey, Charlie.\\
6 - Hey. What's going on?\\
7 - Oh, I just have a friend over\\
8 - from my single parent support group.\\
9 - Oh, yeah. Unattached moms.\\
10 - I got to check out that group.\\
11 - But you don't have a kid.\\
12 - Are they really strict about that?\\
13 - 'Cause, at the dog park,\\
14 - you just show up with a leash and say,\\
15 - "That's him by the tree."\\
16 - It's a single parent group.\\
17 - You need to be a single parent.\\
18 - Seems a little prejudiced, if you ask me.\\
19 - Hey, Alan, can I use your bathroom\\
20 - or should I just pee off the deck?\\
21 - It's right down the hall.\\
22 - Oh, Greg, this is my brother Charlie.\\
23 - Charlie, Greg.\\
24 - Hey. Hey. Nice place.\\
25 - Thanks.\\
26 - She's a little butch for you, isn't she?\\
27 - Greg's a divorced dad.\\
28 - He's got a daughter around Jake's age.\\
29 - Well, you can understand my confusion.\\
30 - You think I joined a support group to pick up women?\\
31 - No. I think you joined a support group\\
32 - because you're a whiny little wuss.\\
33 - But as long as you're there, you might as well nail a few.\\
34 - Sex is not what the group's about.\\
35 - Oh, grow up.\\
36 - You put single men and women\\
37 - in folding chairs in a church basement,\\
38 - they're going to start mounting each other.\\
39 - The depths of your degeneracy continue to astound me.\\
40 - Really? Still?\\
41 - So, Charlie, I am guessing,\\
42 - by the stack of racing forms next to the can,\\
43 - you bet the ponies.\\
44 - Hey, I'd bet on rabbits if you could get 'em organized.\\
45 - Is there a story behind that riding crop\\
46 - hanging on the wall?\\
47 - Oh, yeah-- that's a souvenir\\
48 - from a wonderful weekend in Louisville, Kentucky.\\
49 - Oh, you went to the Derby?\\
50 - Nah. It was a Hilton by the airport.\\
51 - How about you? Do you hit the track?\\
52 - Yeah. It's actually my second biggest expense after alimony.\\
53 - So all your money goes to the nags, huh?\\
54 - Hey, your brother's funny.\\
55 - At first.\\
56 - I'll get us some more beers.\\
57 - Charlie, you smoke cigars?\\
58 - I'd smoke rabbits\\
59 - if you could keep 'em lit.\\
60 - So, divorced dad, huh?\\
61 - Yep.\\
62 - How long were you married?\\
63 - 16 years.\\
64 - Whoa. What ended it?\\
65 - Cheating? Drinking? Gambling?\\
66 - Gay.\\
67 - Oh. Her?\\
68 - No.\\
69 - Ah.\\
70 - So, what, you didn't want to try drinking or gambling?\\
71 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
72 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
73 - Are you kidding?\\
74 - My brother is definitely not the marrying kind.\\
75 - Oh. A confirmed bachelor.\\
76 - No, no, no. Nothing's confirmed.\\
77 - I mean, I just think that variety is the spice of life.\\
78 - And as far as spices go,\\
79 - some people like salt, some people like pepper,\\
80 - some people like salt and pepper.\\
81 - Me, I like women.\\
82 - Me, too. Some of my best friends are women.\\
83 - No, no, no. Don't-Don't-Don't misunderstand.\\
84 - None of my friends are women.\\
85 - Oh, I see.\\
86 - No, you don't. Oh, damn.\\
87 - I'm going to have to take a rain check on that beer.\\
88 - I got to get going.\\
89 - Oh. Oh, okay. We still on for Sunday?\\
90 - Looking forward to it.\\
91 - Really nice meeting you, Charlie.\\
92 - Maybe I'll see you at the track sometime,\\
93 - You never know.\\
94 - Do you like Santa Anita or Hollywood Park?\\
95 - Which one do you like? Oh, I'll go either way.\\
96 - Apparently.\\
97 - Oh, he's bad.\\
98 - You have no idea.\\
99 - Okay, so I'll see you Sunday.\\
100 - Bye-bye.\\
101 - Adios.\\
102 - Great guy, huh?\\
103 - Yeah. Yeah, terrific.\\
104 - How much do you know about him?\\
105 - Well, I know he's a successful architect,\\
106 - his daughter is a soccer player,\\
107 - he's gay, he has a boat, he went to\\
108 - U.C. Berkeley... Okay, okay. Back up a little.\\
109 - Oh, it's a sailboat.\\
110 - Well, it's more of a sloop.\\
111 - He's taking me and Jake out on Sunday.\\
112 - No, no, no, no, no. One more.\\
113 - What, he's gay? What about it?\\
114 - Nothing. I'm just looking out for you.\\
115 - I mean, does he want to take you sailing,\\
116 - or does he want to take you sailing?\\
117 - Don't be silly. He knows I'm not gay.\\
118 - Are you sure?\\
119 - For 16 years, he didn't know he was gay.\\
120 - Come on, Charlie.\\
121 - You don't believe two men can be friends\\
122 - just because one of them is gay?\\
123 - It has nothing to do with gay.\\
124 - Imagine he were a straight guy\\
125 - and you were an attractive young woman.\\
126 - Do you think you could just be friends?\\
127 - How attractive?\\
128 - What?\\
129 - I mean, you know, am I kind of cute\\
130 - in a tomboy sort of way,\\
131 - or am I smokin' hot and workin' it?\\
132 - Okay, okay. Let's start again.\\
133 - Imagine you were a straight guy...\\
134 - And?\\
135 - No "and." That's it.\\
136 - * Men.\\
137 - Berta, how long have you been working for me?\\
138 - Define working.\\
139 - What kind of hair conditioner do I use?\\
140 - I quit.\\
141 - I use a wash-out conditioner,\\
142 - then blow-dry with a dab of styling gel.\\
143 - But you got me a leave-in conditioner.\\
144 - Why would you get me a leave-in conditioner?\\
145 - The truth? Please.\\
146 - It came with a free Lady Schick.\\
147 - Berta, my hair is important to me.\\
148 - All right. Don't get your panties in a bunch.\\
149 - What is that supposed to mean?\\
150 - It means don't get so agitated that your undergarments\\
151 - become entangled within your crack.\\
152 - Hey, hey, hey. I'm not agitated!\\
153 - I just like having extra body without, you know, stiffness!\\
154 - * Men.\\
155 - Okay. Why don't you guys go hang outside\\
156 - while we throw together some lunch?\\
157 - Okay. Come on, Sophie.\\
158 - This is a cool house.\\
159 - Yeah. It's my weekend place.\\
160 - I have a second home in the valley.\\
161 - I think they like each other.\\
162 - Oh, Jake is smitten.\\
163 - I usually only see that look on his face\\
164 - when we go to the Pancake House.\\
165 - Hey. Hiya, Charlie. Hey.\\
166 - How did the sailing go?\\
167 - Great. Perfect weather.\\
168 - Here. I brought you a present.\\
169 - Really?\\
170 - Yeah. It's one of those Cuban fellas you like puffin' on.\\
171 - That's sweet. Thank you.\\
172 - You're very welcome.\\
173 - Did you do something different with your hair? It looks nice.\\
174 - Don't get me started.\\
175 - So, when did you find out about your dad?\\
176 - Find out what?\\
177 - That he's gay.\\
178 - My dad's not gay.\\
179 - You sure? My dad is.\\
180 - No kidding.\\
181 - Yep.\\
182 - You smell like strawberries.\\
183 - It's my lip gloss.\\
184 - Cool. Does it taste like it smells?\\
185 - You want to find out?\\
186 - Sure.\\
187 - * Men.\\
188 - Can we watch a soccer game instead of basketball?\\
189 - What are you, nuts?\\
190 - Sophie says soccer's the most popular sport in the world.\\
191 - Well, then they don't need us to watch it.\\
192 - You know what would be a good idea?\\
193 - Maple syrup lip gloss.\\
194 - Your mom will be here any minute.\\
195 - I thought I told you to get ready. I'm ready.\\
196 - Did you do your homework? No.\\
197 - Oh, Jake, I promised your mother you would have it done.\\
198 - Well, next time, you'll know better.\\
199 - I think Jake has a thing for your boyfriend's daughter.\\
200 - He's not my boyfriend.\\
201 - We're friends.\\
202 - Friends, huh?\\
203 - Alan, when an intelligent, successful, attractive man\\
204 - wants to be friends with you,\\
205 - something's amiss.\\
206 - Excuse me, but if Greg were to be interested\\
207 - in anybody around here, it would be you.\\
208 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
209 - What are you talking about?\\
210 - Come on, Charlie, you got to admit\\
211 - you put out a special kind of vibe.\\
212 - You don't mean special.\\
213 - You mean special!\\
214 - And I don't.\\
215 - You're 40 years old, you've never been married,\\
216 - you play the piano,\\
217 - you are meticulous about your appearance...\\
218 - Hey, hey, hey, hey.\\
219 - I've got a riding crop in my bathroom\\
220 - that never touched a horse.\\
221 - Your bathroom also has two kinds of skin moisturizer,\\
222 - various hair gels, colognes, powders and emollients.\\
223 - I only have one moisturizer.\\
224 - The other one is a sun block with moisturizer.\\
225 - Oh, right, right.\\
226 - You need that sun block for when you lean out\\
227 - the front door to get the paper.\\
228 - There's no shade out there in the morning, Alan.\\
229 - Uh-huh.\\
230 - Excuse me for not wanting to spend my 50s\\
231 - looking like a catcher's mitt.\\
232 - All right, let's scoot away\\
233 - from the Clinique counter for a minute...\\
234 - and discuss some of the people you've attracted.\\
235 - Okay, okay, you're thinking\\
236 - about that time at the House of Blues,\\
237 - and there's no way I could have known that was a guy.\\
238 - He was 6'2", and could palm a medicine ball.\\
239 - I was drunk, he was tucked, taped and gorgeous.\\
240 - Charlie, you brought home a dude in a dress.\\
241 - A dude who wanted to be a woman,\\
242 - which means he was looking for a straight man, which is me!\\
243 - Rationalize it any way you want,\\
244 - but he still sends you flowers on Valentine's Day.\\
245 - Only because I was a gentleman!\\
246 - * Men.\\
247 - So, how was your weekend?\\
248 - It was okay.\\
249 - We went sailing.\\
250 - Oh, how nice.\\
251 - What else?\\
252 - Nothing.\\
253 - Oh, yeah. I think Dad's gay now.\\
254 - That was a red light, Mom.\\
255 - What's up?\\
256 - Why does something have to be up?\\
257 - Can't I just drop by and say hello?\\
258 - At $350 an hour, you can say anything you want.\\
259 - Okay, well, there is something\\
260 - that's been kind of gnawing at me.\\
261 - Mm-hmm?\\
262 - Well, this friend of mine...\\
263 - Your friend?\\
264 - Yeah, a friend.\\
265 - It's your money, Charlie.\\
266 - Okay, okay, is it possible\\
267 - that, that, I could be gay without knowing it?\\
268 - Why do you ask?\\
269 - Well, my, my brother's got this friend...\\
270 - We're talking seven dollars a minute.\\
271 - No, no, no, no. This friend's real.\\
272 - He's gay, and apparently, I triggered his gaydar.\\
273 - Well, I can understand that.\\
274 - You can?\\
275 - (deep voice): You can?\\
276 - Let me ask you something, Charlie.\\
277 - Have you ever had sex with a man?\\
278 - No! No, absolutely not!\\
279 - (sighs)\\
280 - All right, I copped a feel once,\\
281 - but I was drunk and he had breasts.\\
282 - (doorbell chimes)\\
283 - Hey, is Jake ready?\\
284 - Jake, your father's here!\\
285 - He'll be right out.\\
286 - Good.\\
287 - So, uh, how have you been?\\
288 - Good, and you?\\
289 - Good.\\
290 - Oh, come here. I'm so proud of you!\\
291 - Uh, thanks. What did I do?\\
292 - Oh, Alan, you don't have to hide anymore.\\
293 - Jake, told me all about you and Greg,\\
294 - and I just want you to know I completely support you.\\
295 - Oh, oh, gee, Judith...\\
296 - Is that him in the car? Gee, he's cute.\\
297 - Hello!\\
298 - Oh, that must be his daughter.\\
299 - I can see why Jake has a crush on her.\\
300 - Yeah, yeah, we're taking them to the movies.\\
301 - Oh, this makes so much sense.\\
302 - I can't believe I didn't see this when we were married.\\
303 - See what?\\
304 - Oh, come on, Alan.\\
305 - You picking out my clothes, your neat fetish,\\
306 - the show tunes, the sex.\\
307 - There was no sex.\\
308 - Exactly.\\
309 - All these years you were so miserable, and look at you now.\\
310 - You're... glowing.\\
311 - No, no, wait! Hang on a sec!\\
312 - The-the reason that there was no...\\
313 - Really? I'm glowing?\\
314 - Mm-hmm.\\
315 - And to think all this time I've been blaming myself\\
316 - 'cause the marriage didn't work out.\\
317 - No, I'm pretty sure you've been blaming me.\\
318 - It was nobody's fault, Alan.\\
319 - I'm just so glad that you finally accepted\\
320 - who you really are.\\
321 - Hey, Dad.\\
322 - Hey, buddy.\\
323 - Hey, Sophie.\\
324 - You boys are so cute with your double dates.\\
325 - Listen, Judith...\\
326 - I almost forgot.\\
327 - Your mother told me to tell you\\
328 - that she's behind you 100%.\\
329 - When did you talk to my mother?\\
330 - Well, after Jake told me, I called her.\\
331 - Why?\\
332 - We have a little bet. It's not important.\\
333 - Okay, bye-bye!\\
334 - I mean, okay, I do care about my appearance.\\
335 - Plus, I've got mother issues\\
336 - and a bit of a flair for interior design.\\
337 - You know, sconces, throw pillows, bric-a-brac.\\
338 - Mm...\\
339 - But when it comes to penises, I am pretty clear\\
340 - that the only one I want winking at me is my own.\\
341 - Who are you trying to convince here, Charlie, me or you?\\
342 - You. And than I want you to convince me.\\
343 - Why do you need convincing?\\
344 - Wow, good question.\\
345 - Thanks. Once in a while I get a little wood on the ball.\\
346 - I mean, it has been suggested to me that all of my womanizing\\
347 - is just my way of overcompensating.\\
348 - And who suggested that?\\
349 - Uh, mostly the women I was overcompensating on top of.\\
350 - Well, this is a very interesting area,\\
351 - but I'm afraid we're out of time.\\
352 - What?! No, no, we can't stop here!\\
353 - I have a patient waiting, Charlie.\\
354 - Hold on a sec.\\
355 - Here, go get yourself something to eat.\\
356 - Come back in an hour.\\
357 - Okay, new clock.\\
358 - My mom took my temperature the baby way\\
359 - till I was eight years old.\\
360 - (dramatic music playing)\\
361 - Hey, Dad? Yeah?\\
362 - It's okay if I'm not gay, right?\\
363 - * Men.\\
364 - Jake, listen, you and I\\
365 - need to clear the air about something.\\
366 - After I call Sophie.\\
367 - You just saw her. What do you need to talk about?\\
368 - It's boy-girl, stuff.\\
369 - You wouldn't understand.\\
370 - Hey, Alan, your mom called.\\
371 - She gave me the news.\\
372 - Oh, God.\\
373 - Come here.\\
374 - I'm proud of ya, zippy.\\
375 - The world is a much happier place\\
376 - once you figure out whether you're the pin or the cushion.\\
377 - Good night.\\
378 - Charlie?\\
379 - Yeah?\\
380 - I think I might be gay.\\
381 - What did you do, Alan?\\
382 - Nothing, but... I'm starting to put the pieces together.\\
383 - Which piece did you put where, Alan?\\
384 - I'm just thinking that I failed\\
385 - at every female relationship I've ever had.\\
386 - Oh, come on.\\
387 - That makes every man in the world gay.\\
388 - Let me finish.\\
389 - I've been unhappy for most of my life.\\
390 - I never really fit in anywhere.\\
391 - And now, suddenly, I'm happy.\\
392 - Some might even say I'm... glowing.\\
393 - There is a big leap between glowing and flaming.\\
394 - I'm just saying,\\
395 - this friendship with Greg has been, you know,\\
396 - so easy and-and fun,\\
397 - and everybody else just seems happier thinking I'm gay.\\
398 - Maybe that's the answer.\\
399 - What was the question?\\
400 - Who is Alan Harper?\\
401 - Well, that's easy.\\
402 - Alan Harper is an idiot.\\
403 - Why is my sexuality so threatening to you?\\
404 - It's not threatening.\\
405 - I am not threatened. Is that so?\\
406 - Okay, okay, now you listen to me.\\
407 - You're not gay, I'm not gay.\\
408 - Nobody's gay! Nobody's gay?\\
409 - Not in this house!\\
410 - Where are you going?\\
411 - I have to buy some new hair conditioner!\\
412 - * Men.\\
413 - So that was a good meeting tonight.\\
414 - It was okay.\\
415 - But some of those single moms get real gossipy.\\
416 - Uh! Like Rebecca Milford?\\
417 - Oh! Yakkity- yakkity-yakkity.\\
418 - Did you see what she had on?\\
419 - Who could miss it?\\
420 - A woman that size should not wear paisley.\\
421 - Okay, thanks for the ride.\\
422 - Oh. Oh, no problem.\\
423 - So, we still taking the kids to the mall Saturday?\\
424 - Are you kidding?\\
425 - I'm taking Jake to the mall Friday\\
426 - so he can have cool clothes to wear to the mall Saturday.\\
427 - So maybe I'll see you there Friday.\\
428 - Okay. Bye-bye.\\
429 - Greg, wait. Yeah?\\
430 - (grunting)\\
431 - Alan?\\
432 - Yeah?\\
433 - What are you doing?\\
434 - Uh, I was just, you know...\\
435 - checking.\\
436 - Checking what?\\
437 - Well, it's not important.\\
438 - I just thought, uh, that, you know,\\
439 - possibly... I might be...\\
440 - Never mind.\\
441 - Alan, you're not gay.\\
442 - Are you sure?\\
443 - Do you find me sexually attractive?\\
444 - No.\\
445 - Do you find any man sexually attractive?\\
446 - No.\\
447 - Uh, maybe George Clooney.\\
448 - Clooney doesn't count.\\
449 - Trust me. You're not gay.\\
450 - (dejected): Okay...\\
451 - You seem disappointed.\\
452 - I just... I feel like I'm letting a lot of people down.\\
453 - Alan...\\
454 - it's okay to be straight.\\
455 - I know. I guess.\\
456 - So just to put all our cards on the table,\\
457 - you're, you're not at all attracted to me?\\
458 - No. You're not my type.\\
459 - Now, Charlie, on the other hand...\\
460 - What about him?\\
461 - He's, uh...\\
462 - very pretty.\\
463 - Get out of my car! What?\\
464 - You think Charlie's so pretty,\\
465 - go to the mall with Charlie.\\
466 - Come on, Alan, we're friends.\\
467 - No, I'm always the friend.\\
468 - Everybody wants Charlie.\\
469 - Alan!\\
470 - You're not gay!\\
471 - Yeah, yeah, well, there's a principle involved.\\
472 - Good night!\\
473 - Suit yourself.\\
474 - Well, at least I know who I am.\\
475 - A heterosexual nut job.\\
476 - * Men.\\
477 - I can't believe you broke up with Sophie's dad.\\
478 - I didn't...\\
479 - I'm not...\\
480 - I'm sorry.\\
481 - You know what would help this room?\\
482 - Get rid of all these lamps and put in some track lighting.\\
483 - Much more flattering.\\
484 - What are you eating?\\
485 - Lip gloss.\\
486 - * Men.
\subsection {Episode 22: Mr. McGlue's Feedbag}
1 - (car door closes, footsteps)\\
2 - CHARLIE: Thank you for transporting me home.\\
3 - You're a terrific cab driver\\
4 - and I hope someday to visit your country.\\
5 - Damn, where is that key?\\
6 - Here, key-key-key-key- key-key-key-key.\\
7 - key-key-key-key.\\
8 - Aha!\\
9 - Hello, key.\\
10 - (key rattling in lock)\\
11 - Oh, no...\\
12 - wrong house.\\
13 - I'm lost!\\
14 - Hello?\\
15 - Hi, Alan. Come on in.\\
16 - Um, why don't you come in here?\\
17 - I can't. I lost my key.\\
18 - Dah!\\
19 - Had a few cocktails, did we?\\
20 - Me, too.\\
21 - Listen, I need to ask you a favor.\\
22 - Your needs, your needs.\\
23 - What about my needs?\\
24 - Are you capable of having a conversation?\\
25 - Capable?\\
26 - I just spent 20 minutes discussing open-toed shoes\\
27 - with a fat man from Rangoon.\\
28 - He's a Rangooni.\\
29 - We'll talk in the morning.\\
30 - I wouldn't count on it.\\
31 - Go ahead. You talk, I'll cook.\\
32 - It's 11:30. What are you cooking?\\
33 - Good question.\\
34 - And I can give you the answer in two words:\\
35 - my famous homemade chili.\\
36 - Since when do you make chili?\\
37 - There's a lot you don't know about me, Alan.\\
38 - I am man of many layers.\\
39 - Strata, if you will.\\
40 - I see.\\
41 - A thin crust, magma\\
42 - and a chewy nougat center.\\
43 - Okay, uh, anyway, tomorrow I have to go to the DMV\\
44 - to get my license renewed.\\
45 - Ah, cars.\\
46 - Where would we be without cars?\\
47 - And how do we get there?\\
48 - Run, run, you're free!\\
49 - Well, listen, the thing is I can't take Jake\\
50 - because he's got a book report to do.\\
51 - I love Jake.\\
52 - Well, that's good, but will you help him with his report?\\
53 - I would like nothing better.\\
54 - You want chili?\\
55 - Uh, no, no, I'm good.\\
56 - But just so we're clear, you'll help Jake?\\
57 - I love Jake.\\
58 - Charlie, it's very important that...\\
59 - Relax, I'll take Jake to the DMV to get his license.\\
60 - Book report.\\
61 - Beans.\\
62 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
63 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
64 - Oh, no!\\
65 - Charlie's Blackout Chili.\\
66 - It's delicious.\\
67 - No argument there.\\
68 - Why is it called "Blackout Chili"?\\
69 - Well, sweetheart,\\
70 - sometimes when people drink,\\
71 - the do things they wouldn't normally do.\\
72 - Me, I like to walk into a biker bar and take a swing\\
73 - at the biggest chick there.\\
74 - Your Uncle Charlie, on the other hand, makes chili.\\
75 - But what's the blackout part?\\
76 - Ah, geez, Jake, how many times\\
77 - have I told you not to crap up my kitchen?\\
78 - I'm not the one who...\\
79 - Oh.\\
80 - Still, it beats waking up\\
81 - to find pool chalk between your fanny cheeks.\\
82 - Where's your father?\\
83 - He went to the DMV.\\
84 - He said you promised to help me with my book report.\\
85 - Really? That doesn't sound like me.\\
86 - I didn't think so either, but that's what he said.\\
87 - When's it due? Monday.\\
88 - Okay. Today's Saturday?\\
89 - Yeah.\\
90 - We got plenty of time.\\
91 - Yeah, but my dad always says if I do my work early,\\
92 - then I have the rest of the weekend to have fun.\\
93 - That makes no sense whatsoever.\\
94 - That's what I said.\\
95 - Let me ask you something.\\
96 - Do you want to do it now?\\
97 - No. Then trust your instincts.\\
98 - Here's what you do.\\
99 - You go out and have a good time,\\
100 - let the report percolate in your subconscious.\\
101 - Then,\\
102 - as the deadline approaches and that flop-sweat panic hits,\\
103 - those pages will come shooting out of you\\
104 - like a lunch from a supermodel.\\
105 - Well, I do like to percolate.\\
106 - That a boy.\\
107 - What are you doing today?\\
108 - Well, I've got to write a new jingle\\
109 - for a big credit card company\\
110 - and they're expecting it on Monday, so...\\
111 - I'm going to the track.\\
112 - * Men.\\
113 - WOMAN (over P.A.): Now serving number 38 at window "D."\\
114 - I got 42.\\
115 - I made an appointment.\\
116 - Good for you.\\
117 - What's your number?\\
118 - I'm 97.\\
119 - Ooh. Ouch.\\
120 - You're gonna be here forever.\\
121 - Yeah.\\
122 - Oh, hey, you know what?\\
123 - I'm probably not even going to need this Power Bar.\\
124 - You want it?\\
125 - Thanks.\\
126 - You're very kind.\\
127 - Next time, plan ahead.\\
128 - Will do.\\
129 - Got to know how to work the system.\\
130 - Again...\\
131 - thanks.\\
132 - Okay, I'm leaving.\\
133 - Bye.\\
134 - If you need anything, ask Berta.\\
135 - Okay.\\
136 - She won't give it to you, but she enjoys being asked.\\
137 - Turn that off.\\
138 - You're coming with me.\\
139 - Really? To the track?\\
140 - It's got to be better for you than TV.\\
141 - Are we gonna gamble?\\
142 - No, suckers gamble.\\
143 - We're gonna analyze statistics\\
144 - with proven scientific principles\\
145 - and make wagers based on the result of data.\\
146 - I think I'd rather watch TV.\\
147 - Come on. Come on. Come on.\\
148 - WOMAN (over P.A.): Now serving number 39 at window "A."\\
149 - It appears my time on your planet is almost over.\\
150 - (laughs)\\
151 - (mocks laugh)\\
152 - Excuse me. Are you done with your paper?\\
153 - Oh, sure. Here.\\
154 - Thank you.\\
155 - I didn't even have a chance to finish the jumble.\\
156 - Well, I'll have time. Ooh.\\
157 - Hey, 97, that ought to lift your spirits.\\
158 - I'm ebullient.\\
159 - I feel like such an idiot.\\
160 - I didn't even know you could make an appointment.\\
161 - Well, most people don't.\\
162 - Am I right?\\
163 - Lena.\\
164 - Oh, uh, I'm-I'm Alan.\\
165 - Ooh, you have a firm handshake, Alan.\\
166 - I like that in a man.\\
167 - Well, I'm a, I'm a chiropractor and my hands are my instruments.\\
168 - And I also carry a little squishy ball in my pocket\\
169 - to head off carpal tunnel.\\
170 - Ooh.\\
171 - How much can I bet?\\
172 - How much did you bring?\\
173 - I have to use my own money?\\
174 - Boy, you really are your father's son, aren't you?\\
175 - Okay.\\
176 - I have $14.\\
177 - That's not gonna get you very far.\\
178 - Um, oh, and I have a $50 gift certificate to Pizza Hut.\\
179 - Want to buy it?\\
180 - Sure. I'll give you 25 bucks.\\
181 - But it's worth $50.\\
182 - To who?\\
183 - To Pizza Hut.\\
184 - Well, so let the good folks at Pizza Hut\\
185 - place a bet for you.\\
186 - You're just trying to rip me off.\\
187 - Yeah. I've been staying up nights\\
188 - trying to figure out how\\
189 - Now, listen and learn.\\
190 - In any financial transaction\\
191 - there is one question\\
192 - both parties have to ask themselves.\\
193 - We're going to a party?\\
194 - Will you shut up and listen?\\
195 - I thought we were going to the track?\\
196 - I swear to God,\\
197 - I'm going to throw you out of this car.\\
198 - Now, as I was saying,\\
199 - the question is what leverage do I have in this transaction?\\
200 - The answer for you is "none."\\
201 - What's leverage?\\
202 - Oh, boy.\\
203 - All right, a lever is how you move things.\\
204 - Leverage is how you move people.\\
205 - Now, if we were going to Pizza Hut\\
206 - and they didn't take real money and I was starving to death,\\
207 - your gift certificate would give you leverage over me.\\
208 - But alas, this is not the case.\\
209 - Okay, I guess I'll take $40.\\
210 - Now you're catching on. But no.\\
211 - WOMAN (over P.A.): Number at 40 at window "E."\\
212 - I'm sorry, baby, Mama's got to stay here\\
213 - till she gets her license.\\
214 - I'm hungry, too.\\
215 - I don't know how much longer.\\
216 - You want to come in here and wait with me?\\
217 - All right, you stay in the car\\
218 - and play your video game.\\
219 - Mommy loves you, too.\\
220 - I get such little time with him.\\
221 - Where's his dad?\\
222 - Damned if I know.\\
223 - WOMAN (over P.A.): Now serving number 41 at window "B."\\
224 - Oh, he is gonna miss his piano lesson.\\
225 - Listen, um, why don't you take my number?\\
226 - Oh, I couldn't.\\
227 - No, no, no, I insist-- I've got somebody\\
228 - taking care of my little boy, so I can wait.\\
229 - That is so sweet.\\
230 - WOMAN (over P.A.): Now serving number 42 at window "B."\\
231 - Oh, you're up.\\
232 - Thank you so much.\\
233 - Oh, it's my pleasure.\\
234 - Hey, listen, maybe,\\
235 - do you think sometime we could maybe go out...?\\
236 - Hey, Mama.\\
237 - Baby, I thought you were waiting in the car.\\
238 - Batteries are dead.\\
239 - That's okay. We're out of here.\\
240 - You lied to me.\\
241 - No, I didn't.\\
242 - Baby, you got a piano lesson today?\\
243 - Yep. Gershwin.\\
244 - See?\\
245 - Hey, I thought you had her at "squishy ball."\\
246 - * Men.\\
247 - So how much do I get if my horse wins?\\
248 - If you bet $14 at two to one, you win $28.\\
249 - That doesn't sound like a lot.\\
250 - Why can't I bet the 80-to-one horse?\\
251 - You can, but there's dogs with forks and napkins\\
252 - waiting at the finish line for him.\\
253 - What does that mean?\\
254 - It means the greater the odds,\\
255 - the lousier the horse.\\
256 - But he could still win, right?\\
257 - Yeah, and you could still be class valedictorian.\\
258 - But that's not where the smart money goes.\\
259 - You can make your point without being mean.\\
260 - If you want me to bet\\
261 - the 80-to-one horse for you, I will.\\
262 - Okay, fine.\\
263 - It'll be a good lesson for you.\\
264 - You won't be such a know-it-all when...\\
265 - four times eight's 32, one times is zero is zero--\\
266 - $120,000.\\
267 - All right, two lessons.\\
268 - It's not as much as I thought, but I'm still rich.\\
269 - You're not rich...\\
270 - you lucky little peckerhead.\\
271 - There's no reason for name-calling.\\
272 - Mr. Smart Money.\\
273 - You want to walk home?\\
274 - I don't have to walk home.\\
275 - I could take a taxi or a limo.\\
276 - Or a hearse.\\
277 - * Men\\
278 - Mm. You were so smart to bring this.\\
279 - WOMAN: Now serving number 97 at window A.\\
280 - Hey, that's me.\\
281 - You hang in there.\\
282 - Thanks for everything.\\
283 - You're welcome.\\
284 - I was being facetious.\\
285 - Ooh, 99.\\
286 - Lucky you.\\
287 - I'm 138.\\
288 - Been here all day.\\
289 - With my kid waiting in the car.\\
290 - Nice try.\\
291 - * Men\\
292 - Hey, Dad, guess what?!\\
293 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, he doesn't need to know.\\
294 - Why not?\\
295 - Think about it.\\
296 - What's your father going to do\\
297 - when he finds out you've got $1,120?\\
298 - Don't worry, I'm not going to lend him any.\\
299 - No, you clod.\\
300 - He's going to make you put it in the bank.\\
301 - Oh, yeah.\\
302 - Plus he's going to give me grief for taking you to the track.\\
303 - Oh, so I guess that means I've got leverage on you.\\
304 - Hey, I can live with the grief.\\
305 - Can you live without the money?\\
306 - No, I love the money.\\
307 - Okay, so here's what you do.\\
308 - Hide it in your room someplace no one will look.\\
309 - Oh, I saw this movie once where they put the money\\
310 - in a plastic bag and hung it in the toilet.\\
311 - Bad idea. Your toilet sees way too much action.\\
312 - Okay, I'll buy a big safe.\\
313 - Oh, brilliant-- that won't raise any questions.\\
314 - Just stick it in a shoe.\\
315 - But what if I want to wear it?\\
316 - Then put it in a different shoe.\\
317 - But not the same pair, right?\\
318 - Correct.\\
319 - Now, you have to be careful spending it.\\
320 - You don't want to call attention to yourself.\\
321 - Okay, I'll just get a plasma TV.\\
322 - No, no, no, no,\\
323 - no plasma TVs, not computers, no expensive video games.\\
324 - Buy small stuff that no one will notice.\\
325 - Like donuts?\\
326 - Perfect.\\
327 - What about a donut machine?\\
328 - Okay, you're not hearing me.\\
329 - I could hide it in the safe.\\
330 - Get out of here.\\
331 - Hey, where have you been?\\
332 - I told you-- the DMV.\\
333 - All day? You should have made an appointment.\\
334 - Yeah, next time I'll know.\\
335 - So what did you guys do today?\\
336 - Oh, not much.\\
337 - We just hung out, ran a few errands.\\
338 - Oh, did you help him with his book report?\\
339 - Yes, I did.\\
340 - Really? No.\\
341 - Charlie, you said you'd help him.\\
342 - Yeah, well, you said\\
343 - you'd only be living here for a couple weeks.\\
344 - And you weren't drunk when you said it.\\
345 - Fair enough.\\
346 - So you guys just ran errands all day?\\
347 - Yes, errands.\\
348 - Where is he, in his room? Yes, his room.\\
349 - Thanks for keeping an eye on him.\\
350 - No problem.\\
351 - Oh, I have a bad feeling.\\
352 - Hey, Jake, I'm back.\\
353 - I was thinking...\\
354 - Charlie made me go to the track.\\
355 - (sighs)\\
356 - What a day.\\
357 - Just sitting and sitting and sitting.\\
358 - Huh.\\
359 - It was like jury duty,\\
360 - without the fun of sending someone to jail.\\
361 - Sounds awful.\\
362 - Yeah, yeah.\\
363 - So...\\
364 - you guys ran errands today.\\
365 - The little rat bastard sold me out, didn't he?\\
366 - Almost immediately.\\
367 - Why would you take a 13-year-old boy to the track?\\
368 - Hey, I thought it would be better\\
369 - than him hanging around the house all day doing nothing.\\
370 - He was supposed to be doing his book report.\\
371 - Oh, yeah.\\
372 - And come to think of it,\\
373 - weren't you supposed to be working on\\
374 - some big credit card jingle?\\
375 - I'm percolating.\\
376 - Boy, you are some role model.\\
377 - Well, one of us has to be.\\
378 - So, uh, exactly how much did he win?\\
379 - $1,100.\\
380 - Wow.\\
381 - Forget it. He's not going to loan you any.\\
382 - All right, all right, we'll put it in the bank.\\
383 - It'll be a nice addition to his college fund.\\
384 - What college fund?\\
385 - The one with $1,100 in it.\\
386 - Come on, Alan.\\
387 - He won the money fair and stupid.\\
388 - So you think I ought to let him keep it?\\
389 - What's the worst that could happen?\\
390 - So he blows it.\\
391 - It's a life lesson and we get a donut machine.\\
392 - What?!\\
393 - It's just money, Alan.\\
394 - I don't want him to think like that.\\
395 - Oh, much better he think like you?\\
396 - Squirreling away every dime he makes\\
397 - so he'll haven it handy for alimony payments\\
398 - and phone sex?\\
399 - For the last time, I misdialed.\\
400 - Yeah, every Wednesday night for 20 minutes.\\
401 - Okay, okay, we are not talking about the phone bills.\\
402 - We are talking about teaching Jake sound financial principles.\\
403 - And I am entitled to a date night.\\
404 - Fine. Take the money away from him.\\
405 - No, no, I'm not going to be the bad guy.\\
406 - I'm not going to be the bad guy either.\\
407 - Why not? It's your fault.\\
408 - Hey, if you want to point the finger,\\
409 - look for the horse trainer\\
410 - who put crystal meth in Mr. McGlue's feed bag.\\
411 - I'll bet that Clydesdale is still running.\\
412 - Okay, okay, you think you know best?\\
413 - We'll let him keep the money.\\
414 - But mark my words, no good can come from a boy like Jake\\
415 - having that kind of cash to throw around.\\
416 - Oh come on, the kid might surprise you.\\
417 - Here's a hundred bucks.\\
418 - What's that for?\\
419 - I broke a lamp.\\
420 - * Men\\
421 - (playing "Call to Post")\\
422 - * It's the card that's accepted all over the globe *\\
423 - * Something, something...\\
424 - * Terrycloth robe.\\
425 - That's enough for today.\\
426 - Have you see Jake?\\
427 - Oh, little Lord Fartleroy?\\
428 - Well, he wasn't pleased with grilled cheese for lunch,\\
429 - so he walked down to the Red Lobster\\
430 - for their all-you-can-eat popcorn shrimp.\\
431 - Wonderful.\\
432 - He lined his pockets with foil before he left.\\
433 - You think this is funny?\\
434 - The kid gets to throw some money around.\\
435 - What's wrong with that?\\
436 - Hey, Richie Rich back with my crab legs yet?\\
437 - No.\\
438 - You don't understand.\\
439 - Money gives him choices and freedom. Yeah, so?\\
440 - I don't have choices and freedom, why should he?\\
441 - Dad, Uncle Charlie,\\
442 - come out and see what I just bought.\\
443 - Oh, I have another bad feeling.\\
444 - Oh, Jake, where did you get that?\\
445 - A guy had it in the back of his pickup truck at the gas station\\
446 - and it had a "for sale" sign.\\
447 - Oh, no.\\
448 - I asked him how much it was and he said,\\
449 - "How much you got?"\\
450 - And I told him $1,106,\\
451 - and he said, "It's your lucky day."\\
452 - Can you believe that?\\
453 - That's two lucky days in a row.\\
454 - Okay, I am sorry.\\
455 - You did not ride that thing here?\\
456 - Oh, no, I pushed it.\\
457 - I figured I can ride it on the beach.\\
458 - Well, you figured wrong-- it's too dangerous.\\
459 - Don't worry, I got a helmet.\\
460 - I traded him for a bag of crab legs.\\
461 - Can you help me take it down to the beach now?\\
462 - No, you are not riding that thing.\\
463 - Yeah, well, I bought it with my own money,\\
464 - so you can't tell me what to do.\\
465 - Really, I am as sorry as I can possibly be.\\
466 - Let me just show you how cool it is.\\
467 - Look, the guy told me how to start it.\\
468 - He said it might need a tune-up.\\
469 - So where are my crab legs?\\
470 - * Men\\
471 - Go ahead-- say it.\\
472 - I'm stupid and I got ripped off.\\
473 - No, nobody thinks that.\\
474 - I wouldn't say nobody.\\
475 - Charlie.\\
476 - Oh, come on, it's not the end of the world.\\
477 - Look, Jake, sooner or later every guy gets hustled.\\
478 - Even you?\\
479 - Even me.\\
480 - I remember once when I wasn't much older than you,\\
481 - I spend a hundred bucks on a bag of oregano.\\
482 - Oregano?\\
483 - Your uncle was making spaghetti sauce.\\
484 - Yeah, in a parked car\\
485 - before I went to the Pink Floyd Lasarium show.\\
486 - Thank you.\\
487 - The important think is that you learned something\\
488 - that will serve you for the rest of your life.\\
489 - What's that?\\
490 - Always buy motorbikes and oregano from authorized dealers.\\
491 - No, no, that is not the lesson.\\
492 - A fool and his money are soon parted? No.\\
493 - Don't run with scissors?\\
494 - Do you mind?\\
495 - Go ahead, I'm down to\\
496 - don't eat the yellow snow.\\
497 - That's not it, is it?\\
498 - No, the lesson here\\
499 - is that when a little extra money comes our way,\\
500 - we do the smart thing-- we put it in the bank\\
501 - where it makes reasonable interest at minimal risk.\\
502 - And then we have it for a rainy day.\\
503 - Do you understand?\\
504 - Yeah.\\
505 - Attaboy.\\
506 - Trust me, there is no better feeling\\
507 - than knowing you have a little nest egg\\
508 - to fall back on.\\
509 - There are at least eight better feelings.\\
510 - Charlie! Coming.
\subsection {Episode 23: Anteaters. They're Just Crazy-Lookin}
1 - I don't have to go.\\
2 - I mean, I'm sorry I have work to do, so you can't stay.\\
3 - Didn't you hear me? I can stay.\\
4 - Yeah, I wish you could...\\
5 - ...but there's no way\\
6 - I'd be able to concentrate with you around.\\
7 - Don't forget your sweater.\\
8 - Oh, you are so thoughtful. Most guys aren't.\\
9 - Most guys are selfish, hateful bastards,\\
10 - who just want to use you and throw you away.\\
11 - Damn them.\\
12 - Anything else you might have overlooked--\\
13 - cell phone, earrings?\\
14 - Any medications?\\
15 - Hang on.\\
16 - Nope, I'm all set.\\
17 - Good, good.\\
18 - Okay, well, I'll see you soon.\\
19 - How soon?\\
20 - Very soon.\\
21 - So you'll call? What do you think?\\
22 - (voice breaking): I think you'll call.\\
23 - Well, there you go.\\
24 - So when will you call? Soon.\\
25 - How soon? We're back on this ride, huh?\\
26 - Okay, very soon. Bye-bye now.\\
27 - (sighs)\\
28 - When will I learn?\\
29 - ALAN: Soon.\\
30 - Very soon.\\
31 - Don't tell me,\\
32 - tell the cockeyed optimist in my pants.\\
33 - So where'd you find this one?\\
34 - The animal shelter.\\
35 - So, we getting a pet?\\
36 - Are you crazy? We've already got your kid.\\
37 - Then what were you doing there?\\
38 - Standing within earshot of attractive women\\
39 - and mumbling, "Gee, I wish I could adopt them all."\\
40 - It's foolproof.\\
41 - Listen, there's something I need to talk to you about.\\
42 - You know the difference between you and me, Alan?\\
43 - I don't scream when I pee?\\
44 - I took care of that.\\
45 - No, the difference between you and me\\
46 - is I have vision-- I see what others don't.\\
47 - Terrific. Anyway, the thing I wanted to tell you...\\
48 - You look at an animal shelter and see\\
49 - homeless dogs and kitties about to be put to death.\\
50 - Me-- I see an ass farm.\\
51 - Okay, I'm speechless.\\
52 - No words necessary.\\
53 - Silent admiration is all I ask.\\
54 - So, what is it you wanted to tell me?\\
55 - (thud)\\
56 - The railing's a little loose.\\
57 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ah, ah!\\
58 - Oh, I got to stop falling off the deck sober.\\
59 - Buenos dias.\\
60 - Huevos rancheros.\\
61 - Morning.\\
62 - How are you feeling?\\
63 - Like I feel eight feet onto splintered wood,\\
64 - wet sand and a dead crab.\\
65 - I can only think your highly inflated ego\\
66 - might have broken your fall.\\
67 - So where'd you find Pancho Bob Villa out there?\\
68 - You know those fliers that get left in your mailbox all the time?\\
69 - Yeah.\\
70 - Well, I take them and file them according to category.\\
71 - Take-out menus, rug sales, carpet cleaning, plumbing, tiling...\\
72 - Fernando was under "handyman services."\\
73 - You're going to live here forever, aren't you?\\
74 - He's licensed, he's bonded,\\
75 - he's punctual and he's reasonably priced.\\
76 - Are you paying him?\\
77 - No, but I'm saving you 20% with this valuable coupon.\\
78 - Morning.\\
79 - Hey. Morning.\\
80 - (saw whirring)\\
81 - What in the heck is...?\\
82 - Oh, yum.\\
83 - Who is that?\\
84 - He's a handyman.\\
85 - Ooh, nice.\\
86 - Can we keep him? Can we, can we?\\
87 - He's just here to fix the deck.\\
88 - Great.\\
89 - There's a lot of work that can be done in here, too.\\
90 - Like what?\\
91 - Well, for starters,\\
92 - that cabinet door's coming off its hinges.\\
93 - Really?\\
94 - No, it's not.\\
95 - Yeah, it is.\\
96 - (saw whirring)\\
97 - He looks parched.\\
98 - I'll take him some rum.\\
99 - * Men.\\
100 - See, my problem is, is that I'm a giver.\\
101 - I love too much.\\
102 - And it's always the wrong man.\\
103 - You have romance in your heart.\\
104 - Oh, I have romance all over me.\\
105 - I reek of it.\\
106 - Another mojito?\\
107 - Oh, no-- one is my limit when I work with power tools.\\
108 - That's smart.\\
109 - We wouldn't want you to lose one of those beautiful thumbs.\\
110 - Berta?\\
111 - What?!\\
112 - I just thought maybe it's almost lunchtime...\\
113 - Oh, yeah.\\
114 - Quesadilla, bright eyes?\\
115 - Thank you.\\
116 - Coming up.\\
117 - Actually, I'd rather have a sandwich...\\
118 - I'm making quesadillas!\\
119 - Quesadillas, fine.\\
120 - So, Fernando, how's it going?\\
121 - Oh, sorry to tell you this,\\
122 - but you have a problem here.\\
123 - Just don't let her corner you in the laundry room and you'll be fine.\\
124 - No, the deck.\\
125 - When is the last time you put sealant on it?\\
126 - Well...\\
127 - uh...\\
128 - What?!\\
129 - Oh, Se  or, you cannot have wood untreated this close to the ocean.\\
130 - The moisture, she gets in and rots it from the inside.\\
131 - Where have I heard that before?\\
132 - Oh right, my doctor.\\
133 - But it wasn't moisture, it was scotch.\\
134 - You need to replace the entire railing,\\
135 - parts of the deck and the stairway to the beach.\\
136 - Huh.\\
137 - Well, why can't I just put on some of that sealant?\\
138 - You could do that, but it would be, as we say:\\
139 - Orde  ar a una vaca muerta.\\
140 - What's that mean?\\
141 - Milking a dead cow.\\
142 - Ah.\\
143 - Well, maybe before I commit to all this work,\\
144 - I should get a second opinion.\\
145 - I understand.\\
146 - You are a smart and careful man.\\
147 - But I would hurry up before your deck falls off.\\
148 - Something else my doctor told me.\\
149 - * Men.\\
150 - (phone ringing)\\
151 - ALAN: Hello.\\
152 - Oh, hang on, I'll see if he's here.\\
153 - It's Chloe.\\
154 - I need more than that, Alan.\\
155 - The girl you adopted at the animal shelter.\\
156 - Oh, God, she won't leave me alone.\\
157 - What do you want me to say?\\
158 - I don't know; tell her I'm sick.\\
159 - Okay.\\
160 - What do you have?\\
161 - What are you talking about?\\
162 - Are you bedridden or ambulatory?\\
163 - Uh... bedridden.\\
164 - Got it.\\
165 - Is if viral or bacterial?\\
166 - What?!\\
167 - If I'm going to lie convincingly, I need details.\\
168 - I don't know-- I got a bug.\\
169 - Intestinal or bronchial?\\
170 - Just tell her I got the flu, all right?\\
171 - Oh, good, the flu.\\
172 - Is it coming out both ends?\\
173 - Just give me the freakin' phone.\\
174 - (coughs)\\
175 - No, it's okay, I want to talk to her.\\
176 - (weakly): Hello, Chloe.\\
177 - No, I'm fine.\\
178 - Just a little bug.\\
179 - Doctor said I should be okay in a couple of weeks.\\
180 - Me too, baby.\\
181 - I'll call you.\\
182 - Soon.\\
183 - Very soon.\\
184 - See?\\
185 - Was that so hard?\\
186 - Well, to be fair, you had the advantage\\
187 - of making it a performance piece.\\
188 - Hey, dawgs.\\
189 - Hey. Hey, Jake.\\
190 - Alan, here, I need you to sign these papers\\
191 - for Jake's summer school.\\
192 - Summer school, again?\\
193 - Why not? He's getting good at it.\\
194 - Oh, my Lord.\\
195 - Who is that?\\
196 - That's my handyman.\\
197 - Really? I've been looking for a good handyman.\\
198 - Well, it's a little soon to know how good he is...\\
199 - I'll find out.\\
200 - I'm starting to see a trend here.\\
201 - * Besame, besame mucho *\\
202 - * Como si fuera esta noche... *\\
203 - That boney bitch!\\
204 - Yep, definitely a trend.\\
205 - * Men.\\
206 - Summer school three years in a row.\\
207 - They might as well just make you the janitor.\\
208 - Yeah, well, school sucks.\\
209 - That's because you go year-round.\\
210 - Imagine if you had a couple months off in the summer.\\
211 - If I were you, I'd start teaching him\\
212 - how to throw sawdust on vomit.\\
213 - I can do that.\\
214 - Why don't you just go start your homework?\\
215 - What's the point?\\
216 - I'm already going to summer school.\\
217 - Jake...\\
218 - And if I flunk there, what can they do?\\
219 - Send me to regular school?\\
220 - Go.\\
221 - Actually, that sawdust job may be a pipe dream.\\
222 - Is the big one gone?\\
223 - Yeah, she went to get something waxed.\\
224 - We were scared to ask what.\\
225 - I just wanted to tell you\\
226 - I was able to save you some money on the redwood.\\
227 - Oh, that's terrific. How?\\
228 - My cousin-- he works at a lumberyard and...\\
229 - that's all you need to know.\\
230 - Well, thanks.\\
231 - No problem. I'll get back to work.\\
232 - I like this guy.\\
233 - Of course you do.\\
234 - What's that supposed to mean?\\
235 - Charlie, he's a younger version of you.\\
236 - Oh yeah, that must be it.\\
237 - (doorbell ringing) JAKE: I'll get it.\\
238 - There you go. He could be a doorman.\\
239 - Charlie, I really don't appreciate...\\
240 - I'm not saying right away.\\
241 - He could work his way up from doorstop.\\
242 - Uncle Charlie, it's Chloe.\\
243 - Aw, geez, did you let her in?\\
244 - No, she's on the front porch.\\
245 - I told her I'd see if you were home.\\
246 - Attaboy.\\
247 - See? He'll make doorman in no time.\\
248 - She brought soup.\\
249 - Why would she bring soup?\\
250 - You told her you had a bug.\\
251 - So she assumed it was bronchial.\\
252 - If you'd been more specific, like I suggested,\\
253 - you could have precluded this.\\
254 - Nobody just drops by when they think you have diarrhea.\\
255 - And I bet they don't bring soup either.\\
256 - All right, all right, I'm gonna sneak out the back door.\\
257 - Just tell her I had a doctor's appointment.\\
258 - GP or specialist?\\
259 - Alan, I swear to God, I will rip off your head\\
260 - and use your neck as a bedpan.\\
261 - Charlie, you cannot keep lying to this girl forever.\\
262 - Oh, I think I can.\\
263 - Just go out there and tell her\\
264 - you're not interested in a relationship\\
265 - and be done with it.\\
266 - Yeah... I guess you're right.\\
267 - I say we eat the soup before you tell her.\\
268 - Smelled like minestrone.\\
269 - Listen, Chloe, we need to talk...\\
270 - Chloe?\\
271 - (Chloe laughing in distance)\\
272 - Looks like your problem's solved.\\
273 - Are you crazy?\\
274 - That rat bastard is stealing my girlfriend.\\
275 - Forget the girl, he's stealing our soup!\\
276 - * Men.\\
277 - Hey, baby, thanks so much for coming to see me.\\
278 - Yeah, well,\\
279 - that's what friends are for.\\
280 - So, um, Charlie, did you know that Fernando volunteers\\
281 - to build homeless shelters in his spare time?\\
282 - No, I didn't.\\
283 - Did you know his cousin steals wood?\\
284 - Really?\\
285 - That is fascinating.\\
286 - Why don't you come on inside, so we can visit.\\
287 - I'll see you later, Fernando.\\
288 - Well, thank you for your thoughtful soup.\\
289 - It nourishes my body as your beauty nourishes my soul.\\
290 - (passionate shudder)\\
291 - Find something to saw.\\
292 - So, Chloe, what's new?\\
293 - Huh? Oh, nothing.\\
294 - What is he, like, Colombian?\\
295 - I don't know.\\
296 - But I gotta tell you, I do feel much better seeing you.\\
297 - God, it's like his eyes are looking inside your soul.\\
298 - (passionate sigh)\\
299 - Yeah, kinda creepy.\\
300 - The way he speaks, it's so romantic.\\
301 - Hey, I almost forgot.\\
302 - I wrote you a song.\\
303 - Really?\\
304 - Well, Chloe, you've been on my mind a lot,\\
305 - and I wanted to find a way to express my feelings.\\
306 - What's it called?\\
307 - Uh...\\
308 - "Chloe's Song."\\
309 - I haven't put any words to it yet,\\
310 - but it goes something like this.\\
311 - (playing "You Are So Beautiful to Me"\\
312 - FERNANDO: * Can't you see?\\
313 - * You're everything I hope for *\\
314 - * You're everything I need...\\
315 - * You are so beautiful... *\\
316 - * To me.\\
317 - (passionate sigh)\\
318 - You should use those words.\\
319 - * Men.\\
320 - Thanks again for stopping by.\\
321 - Yeah, I'm glad you're feeling better.\\
322 - So when am I gonna see you again?\\
323 - Soon.\\
324 - How soon?\\
325 - I'll call you.\\
326 - Bye, Fernando.\\
327 - Hasta luego, Se  orita.\\
328 - (breathlessly): Oh, God...\\
329 - Call me.\\
330 - You have a beautiful lady, Se  or Harper.\\
331 - Thank you.\\
332 - She must make you feel...\\
333 - how do you say...\\
334 - young again?\\
335 - Yeah.\\
336 - That's what I'm feeling.\\
337 - Oh! Hey, listen, Charlie, I was thinking--\\
338 - after Fernando's done with the deck,\\
339 - he could patch that hole in the roof\\
340 - where the squirrels get in.\\
341 - I don't think so.\\
342 - Why not?\\
343 - I like squirrels.\\
344 - Hey, me too.\\
345 - But they get into the crawl space,\\
346 - where they breed and die.\\
347 - That's what I like about 'em, Alan.\\
348 - I like their little hands.\\
349 - Come on, Charlie, all Fernando would have to do--\\
350 - Forget Fernando.\\
351 - I'm having second thoughts about him even finishing the deck.\\
352 - What, you want to fire him?\\
353 - I don't want to...\\
354 - I just don't think his work is very professional.\\
355 - I mean, he's wasting a lot of wood.\\
356 - And you know, wood doesn't just grow on tree...\\
357 - He's gotta go.\\
358 - Charlie, you're not fooling anybody.\\
359 - You're jealous.\\
360 - Jealous?!\\
361 - You know what's cooler than squirrels?\\
362 - Anteaters. They're just crazy-lookin'.\\
363 - I'm not jealous.\\
364 - And their name tells you what to feed 'em.\\
365 - Why would you say I'm jealous?\\
366 - I'm an omnivore. That means I eat anything.\\
367 - Yeah, we've noticed. Now shut up.\\
368 - I'm not jealous.\\
369 - Charlie, you want to fire this guy\\
370 - just because he's younger and better-looking than you.\\
371 - And he can sing.\\
372 - This has nothing to do with that.\\
373 - And I can sing too.\\
374 - Yeah, but you stink.\\
375 - (knocking)\\
376 - Hey, I'm done for the day.\\
377 - I'll see you in the morning?\\
378 - Hold on, Fernando.\\
379 - I want to talk to you.\\
380 - Yes?\\
381 - Never mind. Good night.\\
382 - Is there a problem?\\
383 - Because I want everything to be perfect for you.\\
384 - You're a good man and I respect you.\\
385 - You remind me of my sainted father.\\
386 - Thank you.\\
387 - He was wise and strong until syphilis made him crazy.\\
388 - Again, thanks.\\
389 - Good night.\\
390 - Buenas noches.\\
391 - I thought you were gonna get rid of him.\\
392 - Or did you go crazy there for a second?\\
393 - I don't know, I just...\\
394 - I just couldn't. Yeah,\\
395 - I think it's his eyes.\\
396 - It's like they're looking right into my soul.\\
397 - That's what Mom said.\\
398 - Women used to say that about my eyes.\\
399 - Really?\\
400 - 'Cause now they're kind of milky and bloodshot.\\
401 - Actually, the one on the right\\
402 - is starting to look a little lazy.\\
403 - You know, you're right.\\
404 - Okay, okay, that's enough.\\
405 - Come on, Charlie, you can't expect\\
406 - to compete with a guy half your age.\\
407 - I am not competing.\\
408 - Well, you shouldn't, because it's perfectly natural.\\
409 - Each generation passes the torch on to the next.\\
410 - The child becomes the hunter,\\
411 - the hunter becomes the revered elder.\\
412 - When you're too old to chase the buffalo,\\
413 - it's time to stay back with the old women and make necklaces.\\
414 - Necklaces?\\
415 - Or weave blankets, tend the fire,\\
416 - teach the kids to whittle...\\
417 - Buffaloes are cool, too.\\
418 - They're like bad-ass cows.\\
419 - * Men.\\
420 - (doorbell rings)\\
421 - Charlie...?\\
422 - Yeah, hi.\\
423 - I was just in the neighborhood,\\
424 - and I thought I'd drop off your soup thermos.\\
425 - Thanks.\\
426 - What did you do to yourself?\\
427 - Me? Nothing, nothing.\\
428 - I was just doing a little work outdoors, got some sun.\\
429 - Oh.\\
430 - What's up with your teeth?\\
431 - Oh, I just brushed 'em real good.\\
432 - So, can I come in?\\
433 - Oh, gee, Charlie, I really...\\
434 - wish you would've called.\\
435 - Oh...\\
436 - Se  or Harper...\\
437 - I was, how do you say...\\
438 - About to sleep with my girlfriend?\\
439 - Okay, "about to."\\
440 - I am so sorry.\\
441 - I would understand if you fired me.\\
442 - Hey, it's no big deal, pal.\\
443 - This is the natural course of events.\\
444 - You're the next generation:\\
445 - young, vibrant, good-looking,\\
446 - you can buy Chloe expensive jewelry...\\
447 - I cannot buy her expensive jewelry.\\
448 - Oh, right, that's me.\\
449 - What do you say, Chloe-- want to go shopping?\\
450 - I'll go get my purse.\\
451 - And yeah, you're fired.\\
452 - * Men.\\
453 - * Men.\\
454 - Charlie, when are you coming back to bed?\\
455 - Soon.\\
456 - How soon? (giggles)\\
457 - I'll be right up, baby.\\
458 - Okay... let me see if I got this right.\\
459 - You bought diamonds for the girl you were trying to get rid of\\
460 - in order to win her from the handyman you fired.\\
461 - I'm sensing some judgement here.\\
462 - You're very astute.\\
463 - Okay, first of all, I got Fernando another job.\\
464 - But the most important thing to remember is, I won.\\
465 - You're a lecherous old guy\\
466 - who bought a young woman's affection with shiny baubles.\\
467 - True.\\
468 - But I won.\\
469 - (heavy sigh)\\
470 - Are you sure we cannot open up a window?\\
471 - No, I like it hot.\\
472 - Okay, well, time for the victor to reap the spoils.\\
473 - Oh, Charlie, aren't you ashamed?\\
474 - Alan, you know the difference between you and me?\\
475 - (thud)\\
476 - Yeah, I wouldn't fire the handyman before he finishes.\\
477 - Hey, I can see your teeth from up here.

2 - Hang in there. It'll pass.\\
3 - Going... going...\\
4 - going...\\
5 - Okay, okay, I'm good.\\
6 - Oh! Brain freeze! Brain freeze!\\
7 - I don't think "brain freeze"\\

9 - ALAN: Oh, geez.\\
10 - It's Mom.\\
11 - Aw, great.\\
12 - Who's that she's with?\\
13 - CHARLIE: I don't know,\\
14 - but they haven't been dating long.\\
15 - How can you tell?\\
16 - He's still smiling.\\
17 - All right, let's get out of here before she sees us.\\
18 - How? They're standing in front of the door.\\
19 - We'll go out the back.\\
20 - JAKE: Hey, look.\\
21 - I'm a rabid dog. (growling)\\
22 - Aw, damn it!\\
23 - Plan B?\\
24 - Bathroom.\\
25 - But I don't have to pee! Go, go!\\
26 - Now what, we just wait here until they leave?\\
27 - Would you rather go out there\\
28 - and chat with Mom and her new boyfriend?\\
29 - Hey, Evelyn, get me a muffin, too.\\
30 - Whew! Somebody's drinking more than coffee.\\
31 - Gonna be long?\\
32 - JAKE: I don't know.\\
33 - (whistling "Bingo")\\
34 - (continues whistling "Bingo")\\
35 - (joins in whistling)\\

51 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
52 - (chuckles): Hey!\\
53 - Look who's here!\\
54 - It's Mom. Hey, Mom.\\
55 - Oh, stop it, both of you.\\
56 - I can't believe I'm such a horrible person,\\
57 - you have to hide from me in public.\\
58 - We weren't hiding.\\
59 - Which does not invalidate your premise.\\
60 - Uh, Jake had, uh, had stomach problems.\\
61 - Don't put this on me.\\
62 - I apologize for my children.\\
63 - Oh, no problem.\\
64 - Teddy Leopold.\\
65 - Oh, hi. Uh, Alan.\\
66 - This is my brother, my son Jake.\\
67 - How you doing?\\
68 - Evelyn's told me a lot of wonderful things about you boys.\\
69 - Not buying it, huh?\\
70 - I tried.\\
71 - Teddy lives in Denver, but he does a lot of business in L.A.\\
72 - So I helped him find a little pied-  -terre in Century City.\\
73 - What's a pied-  -terre?\\
74 - It's French for "a place to play hanky-panky with Grandma."\\
75 - Mom! Mom!\\
76 - Oh, relax. It's not gonna scar him.\\
77 - Yeah, but what about us?\\
78 - Well, anyway, it was nice meeting you.\\
79 - We got to bring the kid back to his mother's.\\
80 - Again, you're putting it on me?\\
81 - Nice to meet you, too.\\
82 - Yeah. Bye-bye. See you, Mom.\\
83 - Bye, Mom.\\
84 - Bye.\\
85 - Wait, I have to pee.\\
86 - You've peed enough.\\
87 - * Men...\\
88 - (phone ringing)\\
89 - "Teddy Leopold."\\
90 - Do we know a Teddy Leopold?\\
91 - That's Mom's new boyfriend.\\
92 - Oh, right, of course.\\
93 - (ringing continues)\\
94 - Aren't you curious why he's calling?\\
95 - (ringing continues) Not particularly.\\
96 - What if something happened to Mom?\\
97 - Then we'll just wait for Dorothy to bring us the broom.\\
98 - Give me the phone.\\
99 - Hello?\\
100 - Uh, no, no, this is Alan.\\
101 - Hi, Teddy. What's up?\\
102 - Uh-huh.\\
103 - Oh...\\
104 - (laughs): Wow. That is, uh, that is quite an offer\\
105 - Uh, I-I'd love to.\\
106 - Hang on, I'll ask him.\\
107 - Uh, Teddy has invited us...\\
108 - I'm busy.\\
109 - Do you at least want to hear what it is? Nope.\\
110 - Charlie can't make it, but can you still take me?\\
111 - (laughs): Really? Gee, thanks.\\
112 - I'll, uh, guess I'll see you then.\\
113 - (chuckling quietly)\\
114 - (singsongy): You're gonna be sorry.\\
115 - (singsongy): You're gonna be homeless.\\
116 - Why do you always have to play that card?\\
117 - Look, Alan, I have no interest\\
118 - in hanging out with Mom's boyfriend du jour.\\
119 - Why not? He seems like a great guy.\\
120 - He might be the greatest guy in the world,\\
121 - but he'll end up like every other husband or boyfriend she's ever had.\\
122 - Either she'll dump him, he'll dump her, or he'll die under suspicious circumstances.\\
123 - No matter what, you're left standing on the curb\\
124 - with your fishing pole on the first day of summer vacation,\\
125 - waiting for a Chrysler LeBaron that never comes!\\
126 - Okay, this isn't about Teddy, is it?\\
127 - Hey, hey, you want to be buddies with this guy, go right ahead.\\
128 - I got better things to do.\\
129 - Better than ringside seats\\
130 - to the heavyweight championship fight\\
131 - at Caesar's Palace tomorrow night?\\
132 - What?\\
133 - Ringside.\\
134 - Ringside?\\
135 - Any closer, and we'd be sitting in the spit bucket.\\
136 - Should I call him back\\
137 - and tell him you've changed your mind?\\
138 - No, no. No.\\
139 - He's just using us to get closer to Mom.\\
140 - When we were kids, it was Disneyland and cotton candy.\\
141 - Now it's ringside seats. And a private plane.\\
142 - He's got a private plane?\\
143 - And a limo\\
144 - and a penthouse suite.\\
145 - Still not interested?\\
146 - Nope.\\
147 - Still have better things to do? Yep.\\
148 - (laughs): Do you realize what a stubborn child you sound like?\\
149 - I do. You're not gonna give it up, are ya?\\
150 - Not a chance.\\
151 - (sighs): Okay, then...\\
152 - good night.\\
153 - Good night.\\
154 - (grunting)\\
155 - * Men...\\
156 - (doorbell rings) ALAN: Oh, boy!\\
157 - Teddy's here!\\
158 - Charlie, Teddy's here!\\
159 - Oh, boy.\\
160 - Hi, Al. You all packed? (laughing)\\
161 - Are you kidding? I packed last night.\\
162 - I was too excited to sleep.\\
163 - Terrific.\\
164 - Where's Charlie?\\
165 - Uh, out on the deck.\\
166 - Give me a minute. I want to say hi.\\
167 - Can I go sit in the limo?\\
168 - Knock yourself out.\\
169 - There's sushi.\\
170 - Sushi in a car! Oh, boy!\\
171 - This is your other plans?\\
172 - Not all of 'em.\\
173 - Later I'm gonna go inside and watch some girl-on-girl porn.\\
174 - Beautiful.\\
175 - Look, I still have an extra ticket to the fight,\\
176 - and there's plenty of room on the plane.\\
177 - No, thanks.\\
178 - Did I do something to tick you off?\\
179 - You know, aside from slipping it to your mother.\\
180 - No, no. It's just I prefer not to get involved in her personal life.\\
181 - I'm not asking you to get involved in her personal life.\\
182 - I'm asking you to come to Vegas with me and see a fight.\\
183 - Yeah, but why?\\
184 - I don't know, you seem like a nice guy.\\
185 - Don't you have your own friends?\\
186 - Charlie, when you get to be my age,\\
187 - most of your friends are either married or dead.\\
188 - What's the difference?\\
189 - The dead ones smell up my plane.\\
190 - Come on, throw some clothes on, and let's go have some fun.\\
191 - Eh, what the hell.\\
192 - Just do me a favor.\\
193 - Let's keep this between us.\\
194 - I want your mother to think that I went on a business trip.\\
195 - No problem.\\
196 - My mother still thinks I went to college.\\
197 - Beautiful.\\
198 - * Men...\\
199 - (crowd chatter, whistles)\\
200 - Hey, Charlie, you need anything?\\
201 - Teddy, if I was any happier, my pants would be wet.\\
202 - Hey, Teddy, uh, can we get some gelato after the fight?\\
203 - Anything you want, kid.\\
204 - (chuckles): Gee, thanks.\\
205 - Hiya.\\
206 - What's up?\\
207 - You know, I've, uh, I've never really been\\
208 - a big fan of the pugilistic arts, but...\\
209 - I have to admit, I'm getting kind of swept away in the pageantry of the event.\\
210 - Uh-huh.\\
211 - I like your bling very much.\\
212 - I, uh, I tried to pierce the ear once,\\
213 - but it got horribly infected.\\
214 - Hey, uh, uh, you know where we could score some good gelato?\\
215 - Nah.\\
216 - (sighs)\\
217 - Word.\\
218 - I think that might be that Snoopy fellow.\\
219 - Terrific.\\
220 - (phone rings)\\
221 - Hello.\\
222 - Oh, hi, Evelyn.\\
223 - Yeah. How are you, sweetheart?\\
224 - Good, good.\\
225 - Where am I?\\
226 - (bell rings)\\
227 - San Francisco.\\
228 - I'm going into a meeting. Uh, can I call you back?\\
229 - REFEREE: No shots below the waist.\\
230 - Love you, too, sweetheart.\\
231 - Bye.\\
232 - You're very good.\\
233 - Yeah.\\
234 - I've got five grand on the big Russian.\\
235 - Either of you fellows like to have a piece of my action?\\
236 - I'll take half.\\
237 - Attaboy.\\
238 - How about you, Alan?\\
239 - Oh, what the heck. I'm in Vegas.\\
240 - Put me down for $20, no, $25.\\
241 - (bell rings)\\
242 - Make it $20.\\
243 - (crowd cheering)\\
244 - REFEREE: One, two, three,\\
245 - four, five...\\
246 - How do you say "Get up" in Russian?\\
247 - seven, eight...\\
248 - * Men.\\
249 - nine, ten.\\
250 - Unbelievable, an eighteen second fight.\\
251 - Takes me longer to start peeing.\\
252 - Yeah, thanks so much\\
253 - for giving me half your action on the guy.\\
254 - No problem. You want the other half?\\
255 - No, I'm good.\\
256 - (video game trills)\\
257 - Oh, yeah, baby!\\
258 - 20 dead presidents.\\
259 - I'm even!\\
260 - Was he a preemie?\\
261 - Actually, we both were.\\
262 - Our mom waits nine months for nothing.\\
263 - Hey, fellas, I want to show you something.\\
264 - What do you think?\\
265 - Nice.\\
266 - Yeah. Who's it for?\\
267 - Your mother.\\
268 - No, seriously.\\
269 - I know it's kind of old-fashioned, but, uh,\\
270 - I wanted to run it by you guys before I asked her.\\
271 - Ask her what?\\
272 - Charlie, I love your mom.\\
273 - I want to marry her.\\
274 - But... but... you could do so much better.\\
275 - That's no way to talk about your mother.\\
276 - That's precisely the way to talk about my mother.\\
277 - Charlie, be supportive.\\
278 - I thought I was being supportive.\\
279 - Regardless of what you guys think about her,\\
280 - Evelyn is a great broad.\\
281 - I want to marry her and I would like your blessing.\\
282 - You got my blessing, Teddy.\\
283 - Shut up and eat your gelato.\\
284 - Come on, Charlie. Wouldn't it be great to have a dad again?\\
285 - I'm a grown man, Alan. I don't need a father anymore.\\
286 - Would any of you gentleman like a date?\\
287 - Sorry, doll, I'm taken, but I wouldn't mind\\
288 - footing the bill for my two boys here.\\
289 - Hi, I'm Amber.\\
290 - I'm Tiffany.\\
291 - Thanks, Daddy! Thanks, Daddy!\\
292 - * Men...\\
293 - Hey.\\
294 - Hey.\\
295 - What are you doing?\\
296 - Nothing, nothing.\\
297 - How was work?\\
298 - You don't care about my work.\\
299 - What's under the pillow?\\
300 - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!\\
301 - Modern Bride?\\
302 - I just read it for the articles.\\
303 - Really?\\
304 - Okay, I was looking for ideas\\
305 - because I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding\\
306 - for Teddy and Mom here in the house.\\
307 - Oh, my God!\\
308 - You're a mind reader!\\
309 - I didn't want to bring it up\\
310 - 'cause I was afraid you might say no.\\
311 - But I was up all night doing research.\\
312 - Now, I'm thinking a sunset ceremony\\
313 - with the guests gathered on the beach below\\
314 - as the bride and groom cross onto the deck\\
315 - wearing traditional Polynesian wedding garb,\\
316 - surrounded by tropical flowers and tiki torches.\\
317 - Okay, what about it don't you like?\\
318 - 'Cause I was a little iffy on the tiki torches.\\
319 - You're a little iffy in so many ways.\\
320 - Okay, we can hammer out the details later.\\
321 - The thing to remember is that we're doing this for someone we love.\\
322 - Right.\\
323 - Teddy. Teddy.\\
324 - Okay, I'm out of here.\\
325 - Her, Berta, did you hear the news about Mom?\\
326 - Yeah, she joined the Mormon church so she can get\\
327 - a rent-controlled apartment in Salt Lake City.\\
328 - Oh, you mean your mom. No.\\
329 - We're getting a new dad.\\
330 - He's great. His name is Teddy.\\
331 - He took us to a boxing match.\\
332 - He bought us prostitutes and gelato.\\
333 - Well, congratulations. I'm real happy for you boys.\\
334 - Thanks. Thanks.\\
335 - I think my news was far more interesting.\\
336 - I'm going to call Teddy and tell him our plan.\\
337 - Oh, great. Ask him how he feels about tiki torches.\\
338 - Hey, Teddy, it's Charlie.\\
339 - And Alan! Hi, Teddy!\\
340 - Yeah, Alan says hi.\\
341 - Listen, we've been thinking about the wedding...\\
342 - (whispers): Tiki torches.\\
343 - What? You're kidding.\\
344 - What?\\
345 - Uh-huh, uh-huh.\\
346 - Wow, I don't believe it.\\
347 - What?!\\
348 - Mom turned him down.\\
349 - That bitch!\\
350 - Gee, Teddy, I don't know what to say.\\
351 - I feel terrible.\\
352 - Well, this doesn't mean we couldn't still hang out, right?\\
353 - So you'll call us? Great, great.\\
354 - Look forward to it. All right, bye-bye.\\
355 - I know that tone of voice. We'll never hear from him.\\
356 - No tiki torches?\\
357 - I don't understand. How could Mom say no to him?\\
358 - He was perfect for her.\\
359 - Forget her. He was perfect for us.\\
360 - I'm closing the door to my heart, Charlie.\\
361 - It just hurts too much.\\
362 - Screw it. This isn't over. Come on.\\
363 - Where are we going?\\
364 - We are going to talk some sense into our mother.\\
365 - Really?\\
366 - It's hard to imagine that turning out well.\\
367 - * Men...\\
368 - Mom?! Mom, where the hell are you?\\
369 - Maybe she's not home.\\
370 - She's home. Her car's in the driveway, the alarm's not on.\\
371 - Mom!\\
372 - Boys, I gave you that key for emergencies,\\
373 - not to barge in on me like the Gestapo.\\
374 - We want to talk to you about Teddy.\\
375 - Teddy? Why in the world would you want to talk about Teddy?\\
376 - Because we love Teddy.\\
377 - And you broke his heart.\\
378 - Hang on a second.\\
379 - You met the man for five minutes in a coffee shop.\\
380 - Well, it was a good five minutes.\\
381 - Evelyn, what the hell's going on?\\
382 - I'll be right with you, sweetie.\\
383 - Look, this is not the best time.\\
384 - Oh, come on, Evy,\\
385 - the Viagra's starting to make my ears burn.\\
386 - Who are these clowns?\\
387 - Ah, Hugo, darling, these are my sons,\\
388 - Charlie and Alan.\\
389 - Whoa. Wait a minute.\\
390 - You didn't tell me you had any kids.\\
391 - I sure didn't sign on for any kids.\\
392 - Just give me a minute, darling.\\
393 - I'll be right with you.\\
394 - If I wanted to see any kids, I'd go visit my own.\\
395 - How old are these nuts?\\
396 - From over here, they look about a hundred.\\
397 - Mom, what about Teddy?\\
398 - Can we please\\
399 - have this conversation another time?\\
400 - No, no, no, no. We are having it right now.\\
401 - What do you want me to say?\\
402 - Teddy's fine. I like Teddy,\\
403 - but he's ready to settle down and I'm not.\\
404 - I want my freedom.\\
405 - Okay, I get freedom, but come on.\\
406 - Teddy's way better than this guy.\\
407 - As I said, Teddy's fine, but there are some areas\\
408 - in which he just doesn't measure up to Hugo.\\
409 - Oh, Mom! Oh, Mom!\\
410 - It's the biggest I've ever seen.\\
411 - Makes it worth eating dinner at 3:30.\\
412 - But, but, but Teddy...\\
413 - I don't want to hear it.\\
414 - You have no say in this.\\
415 - This is my life.\\
416 - And right now I don't want to be tied down.\\
417 - I want options.\\
418 - (bowl hits floor)\\
419 - Hugo?\\
420 - Hugo?\\
421 - Oh, God, no!\\
422 - Quick, somebody, give me the phone!\\
423 - Come on! Come on!\\
424 - Here, here.\\
425 - Oh, God.\\
426 - Come on. Come on. Come on.\\
427 - Hello, Teddy?\\
428 - Oh, I'm so glad I caught you in.\\
429 - * Men...\\
430 - I hope you can forgive me, Teddy.\\
431 - I just needed time to think about it.\\
432 - It's like they say,\\
433 - "You don't know what you got till it's gone."\\
434 - Yes,\\
435 - yes, my darling, I love you, too.\\
436 - Well, I'll be right over.\\
437 - (loud kiss)\\
438 - (sighs)\\
439 - Could someone please put a sheet over him?\\
440 - Mom, shouldn't we call 911?\\
441 - Well, call whoever you want. The man is dead.\\
442 - You're really going to leave and go to Teddy's?\\
443 - Well, I can't very well invite him over here.\\
444 - All right! She's going back to Teddy!\\
445 - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, a little respect.\\
446 - Oh. Oh, yeah.\\
447 - Okay, who's our daddy?\\
448 - Teddy! * Men.

\subsection {Episode 01: Large Birds, Spiders and Mom}
1 - Hey, Berta, how have you been washing my underwear?\\
2 - Like I do everything else around here:\\
3 - With a song on my lips and love in my heart.\\
4 - I'm serious.\\
5 - I got a rash in my, you know, private area.\\
6 - Private? You get more traffic you're gonna have to open a Starbucks.\\
7 - I thought maybe you'd changed laundry soap...\\
8 - ...because it's all red and itchy, especially around...\\
9 - Excuse me.\\
10 - I'm sitting here eating a breakfast sausage.\\
11 - It's not a sausage problem.\\
12 - It's more in the meatball area.\\
13 - Kind of meatball adjacent.\\
14 - I bet it's swamp ass.\\
15 - What's swamp ass?\\
16 - Don't worry, you'd know if you had swamp ass.\\
17 - Man, I hate swamp ass.\\
18 - - You sure it's just a rash? - What else could it be?\\
19 - Since we're talking about your area...\\
20 - ...it could be anything from Ebola to mad cow disease.\\
21 - You get Ebola from monkeys, right?\\
22 - Right.\\
23 - It's just a rash.\\
24 - A kid at school got swamp ass. Cats followed him around for a year.\\
25 - - You know what? Let's forget about it. - Oh, if only we could.\\
26 - Speaking of school, we've got a big day ahead of us.\\
27 - Gotta go shopping for supplies, clothes.\\
28 - Nice segue, Dad.\\
29 - Well, the subject was crying out for change.\\
30 - You're starting a new school. You're gonna need new stuff.\\
31 - Wait a sec. Melon Head made it into junior high?\\
32 - - Yes. - So you passed summer school?\\
33 - - Sort of. - What do you mean "sort of"?\\
34 - They said it was in everyone's best interest if I moved on.\\
35 - What's that mean?\\
36 - Promoted him. He's starting junior high.\\
37 - And there's absolutely nothing to be gained in asking how or why.\\
38 - Okay, well, whatever. I'm proud of you, man.\\
39 - - For what? - I don't know...\\
40 - ...hanging in there till they were sick of you.\\
41 - Thanks.\\
42 - So junior high, huh?\\
43 - Boy, that brings back some memories, doesn't it?\\
44 - Can we please not go down that road?\\
45 - What happened?\\
46 - Nothing. It's just that kids in junior high can be a little judgmental.\\
47 - Especially if you're knocked up.\\
48 - Thank you, Berta.\\
49 - Of course, on the upside...\\
50 - ...the pregnant chicks didn't have to go to gym.\\
51 - Did the guys who got them pregnant get considerations? No, not even a hall pass.\\
52 - Are we quite done?\\
53 - Things will go great for you.\\
54 - - You just have to remember a few things. - Like what?\\
55 - Well, always keep your lunch money in your shoe...\\
56 - ...but have some spare change in your pocket.\\
57 - - How come? - Decoy money.\\
58 - They won't stop hitting you till they get something.\\
59 - Who are "they"?\\
60 - The kids holding your ankles, plunging your head in the toilet.\\
61 - Plunging my head in the toilet?\\
62 - Don't freak the kid out, Alan.\\
63 - It's not so much plunging as dipping.\\
64 - Here's what you do:\\
65 - Make friends with the janitor. They usually have their own bathroom.\\
66 - - Okay. - Just never drink out of his Thermos.\\
67 - All right.\\
68 - And don't believe he loves you.\\
69 - Damn it, I miss that one-eyed son of a bitch.\\
70 - And if you have to shower after gym class...\\
71 - ...there is no shame in keeping your jockey shorts on.\\
72 - - Really? - Okay, there's a little shame.\\
73 - The important thing is the fellas won't be calling you Shrinky Dink.\\
74 - - Shrinky Dink? - I'm a grower, not a shower.\\
75 - Oh, I almost forgot.\\
76 - I got you a little present.\\
77 - - Your very own cell phone. - Oh, cool.\\
78 - The important thing to remember is this is not a toy.\\
79 - - It's to use in emergencies only. - Emergencies? What emergencies?\\
80 - "Dad, come get me.\\
81 - I'm stuffed in my locker and my underwear is wet."\\
82 - That only happened once.\\
83 - If that dog hadn't found you, you'd have missed Thanksgiving.\\
84 - - Drug-sniffing dog? - There were no drugs.\\
85 - That's true. Turns out those dogs are also sensitive to urine.\\
86 - I was in there for five hours.\\
87 - Five hours?\\
88 - But you don't have to worry about that. You have a cell phone.\\
89 - Which you should hide where prisoners of war hid their watches.\\
90 - - Where was that? - Moving on.\\
91 - I've preprogrammed the phone:\\
92 - Speed dial one is me, two is the nurse's office...\\
93 - ...and three is the police.\\
94 - The police? What for?\\
95 - You'll know it when it happens.\\
96 - Now, about race riots...\\
97 - - Try not to take sides. - Anybody asks, you're mulatto.\\
98 - - How do they feel? - Okay, but they're ugly.\\
99 - They look like old-people shoes.\\
100 - They're not old-people shoes. They're walking shoes.\\
101 - Right, for people who've been walking for 85 years.\\
102 - I'd rather get these. These are cool.\\
103 - Listen, junior high is not about being cool.\\
104 - It's about not getting mugged for sneakers.\\
105 - I can get mugged for my sneakers?\\
106 - Not those sneakers.\\
107 - Not unless you go by an assisted-living facility...\\
108 - ...in a rough neighborhood.\\
109 - What are you doing?\\
110 - I'm sorry. This rash is driving me crazy.\\
111 - I feel stupid in these.\\
112 - Better to feel stupid than to be tied to a flagpole...\\
113 - ...while upperclassmen use you as a spittoon.\\
114 - I don't wanna be tied to a flagpole.\\
115 - You won't be. Wear the ugly shoes and don't sit at the wrong table.\\
116 - Wrong table? How will I know if it's the wrong table?\\
117 - You'll be tied to a flagpole, right, Alan?\\
118 - That also only happened once.\\
119 - Let's just check the fit.\\
120 - Good.\\
121 - Plenty of room for lunch money.\\
122 - How come all my clothes have to be beige?\\
123 - Because beige is not the color of any known gang.\\
124 - Right, instead of being mistaken for a Crip or a Blood...\\
125 - ...you'll be mistaken for a Band-Aid.\\
126 - Hey, Band-Aids are ouchless.\\
127 - Excuse me? Excuse me, there's a line.\\
128 - - Yeah, I just got a couple of things. - I can see that...\\
129 - ...but it's not based on quantity of items.\\
130 - It's more of a "we were here before you" kind of deal.\\
131 - You gonna make a thing out of this?\\
132 - There's no thing. Just playing by the rules.\\
133 - And wouldn't it be nice if everybody did the same?\\
134 - Hang on to this, slick.\\
135 - Now, you wanna explain those rules again, jughead?\\
136 - You know what? If you're in a hurry, why don't you go ahead?\\
137 - Thank you.\\
138 - What the hell are you doing?\\
139 - Nothing. Here.\\
140 - No, no, not chicken. Just good common sense.\\
141 - - Fighting accomplishes nothing. - Oh, I didn't know you were so French.\\
142 - - Hey. - Oh, hey, Julie.\\
143 - How do you know my wife?\\
144 - What? Oh, no, no, no, I don't know her.\\
145 - You said, "Hey, Julie."\\
146 - No, no, I sneezed.\\
147 - - Gesundheit. - Thank you.\\
148 - Oh, look, another cashier opened up. Let's go, let's go, let's go.\\
149 - But Mom said I could wait for the bus by myself.\\
150 - I know.\\
151 - I would really rather wait for the bus by myself.\\
152 - I just wanna make sure you get off okay.\\
153 - Yeah, but being walked to the bus stop by my dad and my uncle?\\
154 - I'm gonna look so lame.\\
155 - Jake, buddy, that ship has sailed.\\
156 - Please don't leave me.\\
157 - You're okay. Just don't make eye contact.\\
158 - Okay, when the bus comes, don't take a window seat.\\
159 - You don't wanna be trapped and get pummeled.\\
160 - - Pummeled? - And be polite to the driver.\\
161 - They tend to be damaged people with short fuses.\\
162 - - Fuses? - Don't distract him.\\
163 - There's no seat belts.\\
164 - One sharp turn, and you kids will be flying like lotto balls.\\
165 - Balls?\\
166 - Wait, wait, wait.\\
167 - - Smile. - About what?\\
168 - I need a current picture in case you go missing.\\
169 - Alan, you're being ridiculous. They never find those kids.\\
170 - Give me a profile.\\
171 - Okay, now go make it a great day.\\
172 - Have fun.\\
173 - I just hope everything turns out all right.\\
174 - Well, we've done all we could. Now it's up to him.\\
175 - Okay. Okay.\\
176 - Tell the doctor that if I was a tree...\\
177 - ...the rash is predominantly around the mossy trunk area.\\
178 - But I'm starting to see some redness on the adjacent boulders.\\
179 - Oh, come on.\\
180 - Tree, two boulders, what part don't you understand?\\
181 - - Hey. - Hey.\\
182 - Okay, just have him call me.\\
183 - - Heard from Jake? - Nope.\\
184 - I'll call him at his mom's, see how school went.\\
185 - - Alan, does this look infected to you? - What?\\
186 - Get that away from me.\\
187 - I'm not asking you to tickle it. Just take a look.\\
188 - No, thank you.\\
189 - But you're a doctor.\\
190 - I'm a chiropractor. I work with vertebrae.\\
191 - And contrary to popular belief, there is not a single bone in the penis.\\
192 - Oh, hi, Judith.\\
193 - Nothing. I was just talking to Charlie.\\
194 - Hey, hey, is Jake home from school yet?\\
195 - No?\\
196 - Okay, I was just wondering how his first day went.\\
197 - Have him call me, okay? Thanks, bye-bye.\\
198 - Hope he didn't wander under bleachers during lunch.\\
199 - - He's smarter than that. - Smart?\\
200 - He only got out of sixth grade because he couldn't fit in the desks.\\
201 - If you're that concerned, just call him on his cell.\\
202 - Good idea.\\
203 - Jake? Jake, where are you?\\
204 - You're still on the bus.\\
205 - Funny, I don't hear the other kids.\\
206 - Oh, yeah, it was a tough day. Everybody's tired.\\
207 - No kidding.\\
208 - Dad, this phone is for emergencies only.\\
209 - Why aren't you at your mother's?\\
210 - I got off the bus at school, got on another bus and came here.\\
211 - - So you've never been to school today? - Of course not.\\
212 - I don't wanna be stuffed in a locker, tied to a flagpole or dunked in a toilet.\\
213 - Not dunked. Dipped.\\
214 - - And where are your new sneakers? - Oh, I sold them to the bus driver.\\
215 - Charlie, can I talk to you a minute?\\
216 - - Are those my comics? - Charlie.\\
217 - They're near mint and he wipes his boogers all over them.\\
218 - He was here all day and you didn't know?\\
219 - Hey, I've got a rash.\\
220 - I can't believe he cut school on his first day.\\
221 - When you think about it, it's pretty smart.\\
222 - As far as the school is concerned, he might just be a typo.\\
223 - Charlie, the question is why did he cut school?\\
224 - Oh, that's easy.\\
225 - You scared the crap out of him and dressed him like an ace bandage.\\
226 - Hey, hey, I was just trying to prepare him.\\
227 - For what? A life of running and hiding?\\
228 - No, no, a life of blending in.\\
229 - Only if they see you, running and hiding.\\
230 - Face it, Alan. When the lord was handing out courage...\\
231 - ...you were crouched in a locker, peeing on your socks.\\
232 - Okay, first of all, I had had three Mr. Pibb's at lunch.\\
233 - And secondly, I am not a coward.\\
234 - Come on. I've seen steelier nerves from a cat on the freeway.\\
235 - That's ridiculous.\\
236 - Dingo.\\
237 - Okay, I was not ready and that was not fair. And what about you?\\
238 - - What about me? - You're afraid of everything.\\
239 - - Like what? - Well, let's see.\\
240 - Germs, change, opening your eyes underwater...\\
241 - ...angry husbands, angry ex-girlfriends, large birds, spiders and Mom.\\
242 - Hold on.\\
243 - Hold on a sec.\\
244 - I am not afraid to open my eyes underwater, I'm just sensitive to chlorine.\\
245 - - Right. - And for the record...\\
246 - ...it's just when birds get indoors.\\
247 - In the sky, I got no problem.\\
248 - Fine, fine. Live in denial.\\
249 - I'm gonna straighten my kid out.\\
250 - And what sane person is not afraid of spiders?\\
251 - What I'm trying to say is that it was wrong to fill your head...\\
252 - ...with a lot of horrible things to avoid at school.\\
253 - Because the truth is you can't avoid any of them.\\
254 - Charlie.\\
255 - You don't want him living in fear.\\
256 - - Well, yeah, but I was... - Well, scary things happen in life.\\
257 - - He can hide like you... - Like us.\\
258 - Don't nitpick.\\
259 - Or you can stand up to them.\\
260 - I mean, look, getting hit in the face hurts.\\
261 - - But you know what hurts more? - A kick in the crotch?\\
262 - Well, yeah, sure.\\
263 - I took a soccer ball to the nads once, thought my eyes were gonna pop out.\\
264 - Yeah, but that pain passes.\\
265 - What hurts more and lasts longer than anything...\\
266 - ...is the humiliation of running away.\\
267 - I couldn't ride my bike for a week.\\
268 - Jake, I think you're missing the point.\\
269 - Makes you wonder what they're doing hanging down there in the first place.\\
270 - No, what I think Uncle Charlie is trying to say...\\
271 - ...is that, yeah, you might get hit, you might get stuffed in a locker...\\
272 - ...but you know what? You'll survive.\\
273 - You may get bruised, you may bleed, you may lose a few teeth...\\
274 - ...but you'll have your self-respect.\\
275 - - Exactly. - How do you stop being afraid?\\
276 - Well, I drink.\\
277 - But I didn't start till ninth grade.\\
278 - Yeah, Judith. He was at Charlie's the whole time.\\
279 - Well, he said he was too scared to go to school.\\
280 - How should I know why he's so scared?\\
281 - Maybe you're overprotective.\\
282 - Good one.\\
283 - I know you mean well.\\
284 - Oh, all right. We'll be there in a few minutes.\\
285 - Okay. Bye-bye.\\
286 - - Did you hear that? - Yeah, it's Mom's fault.\\
287 - Attaboy.\\
288 - Come on, it's green. Let's go.\\
289 - What's the matter with this guy?\\
290 - Looks like he's coming to tell you.\\
291 - Lock your doors. Lock your doors.\\
292 - Wait, no, no, wait. I am tired of running and hiding.\\
293 - - Are you tired of running and hiding? - Yes, I am.\\
294 - Remember, Jake, courage is not the absence of fear...\\
295 - ...it's taking action despite fear.\\
296 - That's very true.\\
297 - - Let's do this. - Right behind you.\\
298 - Two against one wouldn't be fair.\\
299 - Now, that's courage. Aren't you proud of him?\\
300 - You got your cell phone?\\
301 - It's only for emergencies.\\
302 - Help me.\\
303 - I think this qualifies.\\
304 - Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.\\
305 - - Hello? - Hi.\\
306 - Charlie. Charlie.\\
307 - You are a bad brother.\\
308 - I really thought you had him.\\
309 - Mr. Harper, try not to sneeze. You'll blow those stitches right out.\\
310 - Thank you, doctor.\\
311 - Hey, doc, while I got you here, let me show you something.\\
312 - Oh, my goodness. Your little jimmy's all crimson.\\
313 - Yeah.\\
314 - So, what do you think?\\
315 - Well, it looks like an allergic reaction.\\
316 - You been applying anything to your genital region?\\
317 - The usual, waitresses and actresses.\\
318 - Oh, wait, wait. Does Grecian Formula count?\\
319 - Grecian Formula?\\
320 - You tried to get gray out of your pubic hair?\\
321 - I wanted to leave silver around the sides.\\
322 - You know, look distinguished.\\
323 - Distinguished? That's interesting.\\
324 - We have a saying in my country:\\
325 - "You can put a tuxedo on a goat, but it's still a goat."\\
326 - Yeah, well, we have a saying in my country too:\\
327 - "Help me, my balls are on fire."\\
328 - Fair enough. I'll get you some salve.\\
329 - How about that? Allergic reaction. Nothing to be scared of.\\
330 - All's well that ends well, right?\\
331 - What did they give you for the pain?\\
332 - You lucky bastard.\\
333 - I wish my balls hurt more.\\
334 - Resynced by Ubolena.
\subsection {Episode 02: Media Room Slash Dungeon}
1 - Okay, okay, okay. It's your birthday.\\
2 - We're going to a ball game, only got three tickets.\\
3 - - Cool. - It's not his birthday.\\
4 - - What else you get me? - Not your birthday.\\
5 - - Charlie, what's going on? - I've got a delicate situation.\\
6 - - I need to appear as if I have plans. - Does your situation have a name?\\
7 - I'm sure she does. Just follow my lead.\\
8 - - Dodgers or Angels? - Let's say Dodgers.\\
9 - See, the kid knows how to do this.\\
10 - I'll get my mitt. Oh, boy, a ball game.\\
11 - - Now, that's commitment. - That's not commitment.\\
12 - That's lead paint in the nursery.\\
13 - Hey, Steve, you down there?\\
14 - Oh, yeah, and my name's Steve.\\
15 - Coming.\\
16 - Charlie, I'm not gonna lie to some poor woman so you can dump her.\\
17 - I am not dumping her.\\
18 - We've just grown apart.\\
19 - Since you picked her up at a bar last night?\\
20 - People change.\\
21 - Hello?\\
22 - Oh, God.\\
23 - In here, Mom.\\
24 - So, what are my boys up to today?\\
25 - We're going to a Dodger game, and we've only got three tickets.\\
26 - So you're on your way to a ball game.\\
27 - Yep. It's a little treat for Jake's birthday.\\
28 - That was months ago.\\
29 - We were waiting for bobblehead day.\\
30 - It's good for Jake to see other bobbleheads.\\
31 - Hey, Dad, I just checked online.\\
32 - The Dodgers are in San Francisco today.\\
33 - Yes, well, we'd better get going then.\\
34 - It's quite a drive.\\
35 - Must you continue with this pathetic, little charade?\\
36 - At this point, we're kind of committed.\\
37 - All right, we're not going to a ball game.\\
38 - We're not? Man, this is the worst birthday ever.\\
39 - Why do you have to lie to me?\\
40 - We don't have to. It's a choice we make.\\
41 - Well, you both might find this all amusing.\\
42 - But I do have feelings, and I can be hurt.\\
43 - Sorry, Mom.\\
44 - It's just crushing to know that my own sons think so little of me.\\
45 - Really? After all this time?\\
46 - Charlie.\\
47 - We're both sorry. Is there anything we can do?\\
48 - Well, as a matter of fact there is.\\
49 - Oh, you just walked right into that.\\
50 - Teddy is out of town, and I need an escort...\\
51 - ...for the Civic Light Opera benefit this evening.\\
52 - Why don't you try one of those escort services?\\
53 - Charlie, if I were gonna pay $200 per hour for a man...\\
54 - ...I would not be taking him to the opera.\\
55 - That's fair.\\
56 - Well, I'd love to help you out, Mom, but I have a date tonight.\\
57 - Oh, so now it's inflatable-sex-doll night at Dodger Stadium.\\
58 - No.\\
59 - No, I really have a date.\\
60 - And the doll was a gag gift from one of my patients.\\
61 - Charlie, what about you?\\
62 - I tried it once, but I prefer a real woman.\\
63 - Do you have plans this evening?\\
64 - Oh, l... Well...\\
65 - Hey, Steve.\\
66 - In here.\\
67 - As a matter of fact, I do have plans.\\
68 - I have a very special lady friend over for the weekend.\\
69 - And here she is now. Hey, baby.\\
70 - Hi.\\
71 - Excuse me.\\
72 - Isn't she something?\\
73 - Okay, but get a town car, because I ain't going sober.\\
74 - Your town car's here.\\
75 - Terrific.\\
76 - Come on.\\
77 - I have been to these things with Mom, and I know you think it's gonna be bad.\\
78 - But believe me, it's gonna be worse than you can even imagine.\\
79 - You're really enjoying this, aren't you?\\
80 - You just love seeing me unhappy.\\
81 - Well, yeah.\\
82 - Did you feel sorry for me when I had to wear that cowboy outfit...\\
83 - ...to her celebrity AIDS hoedown?\\
84 - - That was different. - How?\\
85 - It was you.\\
86 - Yeah, well, now it's you.\\
87 - Yippee kay yay, mother accompanier.\\
88 - Want a few tips?\\
89 - Like what?\\
90 - Well, let's see.\\
91 - Mom likes to starve herself for a few days before these...\\
92 - ...so she can fit into her gown.\\
93 - That means she'll be knocking back vodka gimlets on an empty stomach.\\
94 - - Oh, jeez, she can be a cranky drunk. - Cranky?\\
95 - I got bitch-slapped with my own 10-gallon hat.\\
96 - So, what's the tip? Don't wear a 10-gallon hat?\\
97 - All you have to do is bring along a little baggie of crackers...\\
98 - ...you know, saltines, Goldfish.\\
99 - Anything you can stuff down her throat to soak up the booze.\\
100 - How about a throw pillow?\\
101 - Oh, oh, and whatever you do, don't let her take off her shoes.\\
102 - - Why not? - Well, A,\\
103 - ...you'll be carrying them all night, and B...\\
104 - ...you'll wind up giving her a foot massage.\\
105 - That's not something anybody wants to see.\\
106 - Oh, God.\\
107 - Not to mention the fact that it puts you on bunion patrol.\\
108 - Anyway, have fun.\\
109 - I'm off to pick up a beautiful, smart, funny, sexually-available woman...\\
110 - ...who, best of all, is not my mother.\\
111 - Give it time. You'll get her there.\\
112 - In consideration of the evening you have ahead of you...\\
113 - ...I'm gonna let you have that one.\\
114 - Yeah, these are the good times.\\
115 - Another gimlet, please.\\
116 - You sure you don't want a Wheat Thin?\\
117 - Wheaty.\\
118 - No, I need the liquor to dull the pain.\\
119 - My shoes are killing me.\\
120 - Yeah, but they look wonderful on your feet, right where they are now.\\
121 - - Oh, look who's over there. - Who?\\
122 - One of the most powerful union leaders in Hollywood.\\
123 - What about him?\\
124 - - Really? The mob? - Yeah.\\
125 - They say he killed a writer once just to make a point.\\
126 - What was the point?\\
127 - "I can kill a writer."\\
128 - - And the silver-haired man he's talking to. - Yeah?\\
129 - That is the king of vaginal-rejuvenation surgery.\\
130 - But, interestingly, he's never used one himself...\\
131 - ...rejuvenated or otherwise.\\
132 - Wouldn't that make him the queen of vaginal surgery?\\
133 - Good for you, Charlie.\\
134 - I wish I'd thought of that.\\
135 - And from now on, I did.\\
136 - It's yours.\\
137 - So, what other dirt you got?\\
138 - Oh, darling, you know, I don't like to speak ill of anyone.\\
139 - All right.\\
140 - Bankrupt, embezzler, tushie tuck, bigamist, pill freak.\\
141 - And that one over there?\\
142 - Underwent surgery to have a cell phone removed from his lower intestine.\\
143 - - How in the world did it get there? - One can speculate.\\
144 - But I have it on good authority that it was set to vibrate.\\
145 - How do you know all these things?\\
146 - Oh, Charlie, it's my business to know these things.\\
147 - High-end real estate is all about gathering information and forging relationships.\\
148 - Hello, Beatrice, darling.\\
149 - Lovely to see you, you two-dollar whore.\\
150 - You know, Mom, it's great to watch you doing autopsies...\\
151 - ...when I'm not the cadaver.\\
152 - Half the fun is sharing with someone you love.\\
153 - You see that statuesque woman over there?\\
154 - The one with the knock-off Prada handbag?\\
155 - Don't tell me. She's not a woman.\\
156 - Oh, she's a woman.\\
157 - She's an amazing woman.\\
158 - She built a children's hospital in Guatemala.\\
159 - Yeah, and...?\\
160 - Once they're healthy enough to walk, she flies them to Los Angeles...\\
161 - ...and leases them out to celebrities as household slaves.\\
162 - Hello, dear.\\
163 - I'm trying to sell her home.\\
164 - Kind of hard to put a good spin on media-room-slash-dungeon.\\
165 - I'm sorry, Alan. I can't do this.\\
166 - Sure you can. I mean, you are.\\
167 - And if you'll allow me to say so, you're pretty good at it.\\
168 - It's not you, it's me.\\
169 - - Yeah, right. - What is that supposed to mean?\\
170 - Sharon, I have been rejected by 32 different women in my life.\\
171 - And you know what? It's never been me.\\
172 - Okay, it's you. Feel better?\\
173 - Actually, no.\\
174 - You're a very nice guy.\\
175 - That's even worse. You know what they say about nice guys.\\
176 - Yes, they finish last.\\
177 - No, they finish in the shower.\\
178 - What do you want? I can't help if I'm not sexually attracted to you.\\
179 - Yes, you can. You just have to make an effort.\\
180 - You know those jokes you don't get right away?\\
181 - And then in a day or two, you find yourself laughing and laughing?\\
182 - That's me.\\
183 - I'm one of those jokes.\\
184 - You'll sleep with me now, and you'll be attracted to me later.\\
185 - Please, Sharon, just give me a chance.\\
186 - Oh, what the hell.\\
187 - Good to see you, dear.\\
188 - You look marvelous. For a heroin addict.\\
189 - Let me ask you something.\\
190 - If you don't like any of these people, why do you come?\\
191 - Charlie, do you read the paper?\\
192 - Do you have any idea what the Los Angeles real-estate market is like now?\\
193 - Can't say I do. How are those feet feeling?\\
194 - - You wanna put your shoes back on? - No one is selling unless they have to.\\
195 - Which means, I have to be out working these rooms every night...\\
196 - ...to learn who's getting divorced, who's dying, can't make bail...\\
197 - ...whose crappy sitcom got canceled.\\
198 - I mean, let's face it. I'm not a young woman anymore.\\
199 - In the old days, I could find out all that stuff at home on my back.\\
200 - Evelyn.\\
201 - Margaret, good to see you.\\
202 - - How's married life? - Oh, just one long honeymoon.\\
203 - That's because she bangs a different groom every night.\\
204 - Hi. Charlie Harper.\\
205 - Oh, my God.\\
206 - That was amazing.\\
207 - Wasn't that amazing?\\
208 - I hate myself.\\
209 - What? No, no, no, you were great.\\
210 - You did a crackerjack job.\\
211 - Why do I always do this? Why do I have this constant need to degrade myself?\\
212 - Would it help to cuddle?\\
213 - Don't touch me.\\
214 - Okay. No touching.\\
215 - The image of you lying on top of me will haunt me forever.\\
216 - Did you wanna be on top?\\
217 - Because if you give me a half an hour and a glass of juice, we can try that.\\
218 - Hi, hi, Dr. Phillips. It's me, Sharon.\\
219 - I did it again.\\
220 - I don't know why.\\
221 - I felt sorry for him.\\
222 - Hey, hey, why don't I whip us up some French toast?\\
223 - Shut up.\\
224 - Okay, I'm just gonna get a nice glass of cran-apple just in case.\\
225 - How bad was it?\\
226 - How bad was it? I'm in a fold-out bed.\\
227 - Morning.\\
228 - Morning.\\
229 - Hey, Berta, you're a woman...\\
230 - Where are we going with this, zippy?\\
231 - I was just wondering.\\
232 - What does it mean when someone starts crying uncontrollably...\\
233 - ...after sex?\\
234 - Well, in my experience, it usually means the conjugal visit's over.\\
235 - Right. Thanks.\\
236 - What happened? You get yourself a weeper?\\
237 - Yeah. Yeah, last night.\\
238 - I've never seen anything like it before.\\
239 - That's hard to believe.\\
240 - I got it.\\
241 - Hello?\\
242 - Oh, hey, Mom. How are you?\\
243 - Yeah, that was fun last night.\\
244 - No, I'm not doing anything. Why?\\
245 - Sure. I'd love to go shopping with you.\\
246 - Great. I'll see you then.\\
247 - What?\\
248 - - Nothing. - Nothing.\\
249 - Hey, hey, Mom's not that bad.\\
250 - In fact, she's kind of fun to hang out with.\\
251 - That has to be the creepiest thing I've ever heard.\\
252 - You know, I said the same thing to myself just a couple minutes ago.\\
253 - - You sure you can't stay for dinner? - Oh, I'd love to, sweetie.\\
254 - But Teddy's back in town, and Mommy plans to get laid tonight.\\
255 - Well, good for you. Please, give him my best.\\
256 - Only after I give him my best.\\
257 - - Hello. - Oh, hi, Alan.\\
258 - Don't forget your little gifty.\\
259 - You bought him a gifty?\\
260 - My way of saying, "Thank you for lunch."\\
261 - You took her to lunch?\\
262 - I must have gained 5 pounds.\\
263 - Oh, stop. You have a terrific figure.\\
264 - Thank you.\\
265 - Are you high?\\
266 - It never hurts to pay a compliment to someone you care about.\\
267 - Yeah, you should try it once in a while.\\
268 - Might cut down on that postcoital weeping.\\
269 - How did you know about that?\\
270 - Berta told me, I told Mom.\\
271 - Your brother and I don't have any secrets.\\
272 - Maybe I'm high.\\
273 - Okay, well, I must be off.\\
274 - Places to go, houses to sell, new widows to cold call.\\
275 - Oh, oh, that reminds me.\\
276 - Charlie, some woman named Margaret called looking for you.\\
277 - Margaret?\\
278 - Oh, yeah, Honeymoon Margaret from last night.\\
279 - Charlie.\\
280 - The woman's husband is one of my biggest clients.\\
281 - - Oh, Mom. - Please, I'm not asking as your mother.\\
282 - I'm asking as your friend.\\
283 - All right, as a friend, hands off.\\
284 - Thank you, darling.\\
285 - I love you.\\
286 - See you, Alan.\\
287 - I guess I'll just throw this away.\\
288 - What? You're not gonna call her, are you?\\
289 - Well, it's a bit of a dilemma.\\
290 - On the one hand, there's this beautiful, available woman.\\
291 - - She's married. - According to Mom...\\
292 - ...not a fanatic about it.\\
293 - So am I the kind of guy who would go back on his word to his own mother...\\
294 - ...just for a really hot one-night stand?\\
295 - Is that a rhetorical question?\\
296 - Tell you what.\\
297 - We'll leave it to chance.\\
298 - If I miss, I'll take the high road.\\
299 - If it goes in, I'll call Margaret.\\
300 - I guess it's fate.\\
301 - Are you ready for me?\\
302 - Oh, bravo.\\
303 - Just to be clear, this is a tit for tat kind of deal, right?\\
304 - Your husband cheated on you, the rotten bastard.\\
305 - - And now you're cheating on him? - No, he never cheated on me.\\
306 - Oh, so what? He's mean to you, he's abusive?\\
307 - No. He's a doll.\\
308 - Is he gay?\\
309 - Not at all.\\
310 - Was he in some sort of bizarre hunting accident?\\
311 - What?\\
312 - You know, fell crotch-first into an open bear trap?\\
313 - No. He's all man.\\
314 - So then why are you doing this?\\
315 - Well, it's very simple.\\
316 - I like having sex with strangers.\\
317 - Well, good for you.\\
318 - Is your husband hiding somewhere watching us?\\
319 - No. He's in Dallas on business.\\
320 - Charlie, are we gonna do this or what?\\
321 - - Actually, I don't think I can. - Why not?\\
322 - Well, I kind of promised my mother I wouldn't.\\
323 - - Your mother? - She's also my friend.\\
324 - So, what do you wanna do?\\
325 - Tell you what.\\
326 - We'll leave it to chance.\\
327 - If I nail this, then, you know, ditto.\\
328 - Margaret.\\
329 - - Oh, God. - Who's that?\\
330 - - Who do you think? - Another stranger?\\
331 - My husband. Get out.\\
332 - Right.\\
333 - - Where the hell should I go? - Out the window.\\
334 - I'm not going out the window.\\
335 - - He's an ex-Marine. - I'm going out the window.\\
336 - Oh, damn.\\
337 - - Hi. - Sharon?\\
338 - - What's up? - I was hoping we could talk.\\
339 - Oh, sure.\\
340 - May I come in?\\
341 - - Okay. - Thanks.\\
342 - I'm kind of surprised to see you.\\
343 - I know. I behaved really badly the other night.\\
344 - You were a little emotional.\\
345 - I wasn't a little emotional. I was borderline psychotic.\\
346 - Well, since you brought it up, I'd say you crossed that border...\\
347 - ...with 10 more crazy people in your trunk.\\
348 - I know. I'm so sorry.\\
349 - I get like that sometimes.\\
350 - It's a combination of low self-esteem, low blood sugar...\\
351 - ...and mixing red wine with my dog's painkillers.\\
352 - I once took my cold medication with a mimosa.\\
353 - Spaced me out the whole day.\\
354 - - So you forgive me? - Oh, absolutely.\\
355 - Oh, thank you, Alan.\\
356 - Don't mention it.\\
357 - What are we doing?\\
358 - I'd like to make it up to you.\\
359 - Do you really think that's a good idea? Last time it didn't work out so well.\\
360 - Please, Alan, just give me another chance?\\
361 - Oh, what the hell.\\
362 - - I thought you were in Dallas. - I was.\\
363 - I got a phone call telling me to check on my wife.\\
364 - A phone call? From who?\\
365 - That's not important.\\
366 - This marriage is over.\\
367 - I want you out of my house.\\
368 - Well, I'm not leaving.\\
369 - You're gonna have to, because I'm selling it.\\
370 - In this market? Are you crazy?\\
371 - I've got a great realtor.\\
372 - And she assures me she can get top dollar.\\
373 - You've already talked to a realtor?\\
374 - Who do you think called me in Dallas?\\
375 - And she's not just my realtor.\\
376 - She's my friend.\\
377 - Oh, Mom.\\
378 - I hate you.\\
379 - You're a pig, and you used me.\\
380 - Hey, she's cute.\\
381 - Yes, she is.\\
382 - - So how's it going? - Well, we're trying to make it work.\\
383 - Good for you.\\
384 - So how was your night?\\
385 - You'd be proud of me.\\
386 - - I took the high road. - Congratulations.\\
387 - Didn't matter.\\
388 - It rarely does.\\
389 - Wait a minute. You're telling me...\\
390 - ...Mom knew you were gonna sleep with that woman...\\
391 - ...and called the husband so that he'd catch her?\\
392 - Yep.\\
393 - The marriage ends and Mom gets a big commission for selling their house.\\
394 - She's an evil genius, Alan.\\
395 - If she lived in Gotham City, Batman would be toast.\\
396 - Hey, isn't that your new girlfriend?\\
397 - Where?\\
398 - Over there.\\
399 - Walking into the ocean with all her clothes on.\\
400 - Oh, yeah.\\
401 - She gets a little suicidal after we have sex.\\
402 - Yeah, yeah...\\
403 - Well, I'd better go pull her in.\\
404 - Ask if she's got a friend.\\
405 - Resynced by Ubolena.
\subsection {Episode 03: Dum Diddy Dum Diddy Doo}
1 - No, I think your retainer is sexy.\\
2 - I do. You just gotta remember to clean it after lunch.\\
3 - Hey, Jake, how about you and me going out...?\\
4 - Okay, now I have a question for you.\\
5 - If I needed a lung and your dad needed a lung...\\
6 - ...who would you give your lung to?\\
7 - Well, now see, I wouldn't have to think about it.\\
8 - Jake, I'm talking to you. Don't give me the hand.\\
9 - Hang on. I'm talking to a girl.\\
10 - Sorry. Oh, no, that was nobody.\\
11 - That's it. Time to get a new kid.\\
12 - Hey, Alan, you wanna catch a movie tonight?\\
13 - Can't. I am taking a lady to the Hollywood Bowl...\\
14 - ...for a romantic evening under the stars with Michael Bubl ...\\
15 - ...and three runners-up from American Idol.\\
16 - What's in the bag, a noose?\\
17 - No, it's a picnic basket. Fried chicken, bottle of merlot...\\
18 - ...and my autograph hound in case I get lucky.\\
19 - - Why don't you take Jake to the movies? - No, I don't like him anymore.\\
20 - Okay, then why don't you take one of your many...?\\
21 - Oh, let's call them girlfriends.\\
22 - Yeah, I could...\\
23 - ...but, after the movie, I bring them back here...\\
24 - ...after I get them here, I get them upstairs.\\
25 - After I get them upstairs, I gotta get them to go home.\\
26 - It just doesn't seem worth the effort anymore.\\
27 - It's possible you might enjoy your dates if you went out with women...\\
28 - ...who are capable of using their head other than a place to rest their ankles.\\
29 - What are you saying?\\
30 - Too subtle?\\
31 - I'm saying you might have a better time if you were seeing someone...\\
32 - ...who had a fully formed personality or was even remotely age-appropriate.\\
33 - - Define "age appropriate." - Forty.\\
34 - Are you out of your mind?\\
35 - Come on, Charlie. The woman I'm seeing now is 39.\\
36 - We have a wonderful time because we have so much in common.\\
37 - We can talk, we can share, we can laugh.\\
38 - Talking, sharing and laughing is fine but what about her ears?\\
39 - - What about them? - Ears never stop growing, Alan.\\
40 - And I like a nice, taut lobe.\\
41 - This conversation is over.\\
42 - I will see you later.\\
43 - Why do you think old ladies wear big earrings?\\
44 - To make their ears look smaller.\\
45 - Like I'm the only one who's noticed.\\
46 - I'd like to make a toast to my wife.\\
47 - Darling, you've given me the happiest 20 years of my life.\\
48 - Why? Was she in a coma?\\
49 - I can 't imagine living without you. You complete me.\\
50 - Bet she's got a set of ears on her.\\
51 - Oh, yeah.\\
52 - You could swat flies with those things.\\
53 - Hey, pal.\\
54 - It's just you and me tonight, huh?\\
55 - Yeah, I know how you feel.\\
56 - There's a lot of fish in the sea...\\
57 - ...but after you catch them and eat them, then what?\\
58 - Damn straight. It's not worth the hassle.\\
59 - My mistake. Didn't know you had a date.\\
60 - If you two don't have plans, why don't you fly to the Hollywood Bowl...\\
61 - ...and take a crap on my brother?\\
62 - Really? I dreamt about you too. What was your dream?\\
63 - We were on a train in a tunnel?\\
64 - Sounds kind of boring.\\
65 - It means what?\\
66 - Oh, hey, you're up early.\\
67 - No way.\\
68 - I am not just getting home. I couldn't sleep so I went for a walk.\\
69 - Dad, a little privacy, please?\\
70 - Okay, I just didn't want you to get the wrong idea.\\
71 - I'm confused. If I'm in the train, how can I be the train?\\
72 - At least he's not the tunnel.\\
73 - Hi.\\
74 - I'm just getting in.\\
75 - Yeah, I can see that.\\
76 - Didn't get much sleep last night.\\
77 - - And yet I feel totally rested. - Good for you.\\
78 - I mean, rested but spent.\\
79 - Gotcha.\\
80 - I mean, not so much spent as happily depleted.\\
81 - - Joyously bereft of... - I get it. You got laid.\\
82 - And Michael Bubl 's autograph.\\
83 - Congratulations.\\
84 - So how was your evening?\\
85 - You know, I talked to Donna about you.\\
86 - - Donna? - The woman I was with last night.\\
87 - Oh, yeah, yeah. You talk, you share, you laugh. Kiss my ass.\\
88 - Anyway, turns out she has a friend who's newly single.\\
89 - - And I suggested... - A blind date?\\
90 - Forget it. Charlie Harper does not go on blind dates.\\
91 - - He doesn't? - No, he doesn't.\\
92 - Can't we ask him?\\
93 - Don't bother. I know what he'll say.\\
94 - Okay, but does he have to say it in the third person?\\
95 - Look, I don't need anybody to get me dates. I can get my own dates.\\
96 - But you were complaining that the women you go out with don't fulfill you.\\
97 - Donna's friend is beautiful. She's accomplished, she's smart.\\
98 - - How old is she? - I think around 40.\\
99 - Hello.\\
100 - - Still with the ears? - It's not just ears.\\
101 - Women that age have a lot of baggage.\\
102 - Right. And you've just got a carryon.\\
103 - Think about this. What if I meet this woman?\\
104 - I like her, she likes me, we get married and settle down?\\
105 - We're both 40 now. In 20 years, I'm gonna be 60.\\
106 - And do you know how old she's gonna be?\\
107 - - Sixty? - I rest my case.\\
108 - - That was nice, huh? - I guess.\\
109 - My ear's still a little soggy.\\
110 - Sorry.\\
111 - So, Deedee, is that short for anything?\\
112 - - Like what? - I don't know.\\
113 - No, it's just a nickname.\\
114 - - What's your real name? - Sissy.\\
115 - Sissy, huh?\\
116 - I guess that means you throw a ball like a girl.\\
117 - I am a girl.\\
118 - Right.\\
119 - - Is Charlie short for anything? - Charles.\\
120 - That's not really shorter, is it?\\
121 - Excuse me.\\
122 - Why? Did you fart?\\
123 - No, you hang up first.\\
124 - Okay, on three.\\
125 - One, two, three.\\
126 - You didn't hang up, did you? Me neither.\\
127 - Okay, set it up.\\
128 - What?\\
129 - The blind date with the old chick. I'm in.\\
130 - What?\\
131 - - Alan, let's go. - Relax, we've got plenty of time.\\
132 - I just don't wanna be late.\\
133 - I can't believe it. You're nervous about a date.\\
134 - Of course I'm nervous. What am I gonna talk to her about?\\
135 - I haven't gone out with a 40-year-old woman since high school.\\
136 - Charlie, that's the great thing about seeing someone your own age.\\
137 - There's always something to talk about.\\
138 - What you've been through, she's been through.\\
139 - Oh, I hardly think so.\\
140 - All right, point taken. But she's a fascinating woman.\\
141 - She's a municipal court judge, she teaches law at UCLA.\\
142 - Oh, man, you didn't tell me that.\\
143 - - Does that make a difference? - Big difference.\\
144 - The smarter the girl, the harder it is to blow smoke up her ass.\\
145 - You know, I'm already regretting this.\\
146 - And for good reason. Let's just call it off.\\
147 - No, no, no, it's too late for that.\\
148 - Just relax and, I don't know, be yourself.\\
149 - And by "yourself," I mean someone else entirely.\\
150 - Anything else?\\
151 - Well, as long we've opened this particular can of worms...\\
152 - ...you might wanna rethink the bowling shirt.\\
153 - - Why? - Well, as I said...\\
154 - ...she's a judge and a law professor.\\
155 - And, let's be honest, you don't bowl.\\
156 - All right, I'll go change.\\
157 - - And Charlie? - Yeah?\\
158 - While you're at it, why don't we go for the big-boy pants.\\
159 - Fine.\\
160 - - Oh, there they are. - Hang on, hang on, hang on.\\
161 - Which one's mine?\\
162 - - The one on the right. - Wow, she's 40?\\
163 - She has the ears of a 20-year-old.\\
164 - Come on.\\
165 - You think she had them done?\\
166 - Sorry we're late. Charlie couldn't decide what to wear.\\
167 - Oh, I think he looks very nice.\\
168 - - Thank you. - Charlie, this is Donna.\\
169 - - Hi, how are you? - Hi.\\
170 - This is my friend, Linda.\\
171 - - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too.\\
172 - - I've heard a lot about you. - And I've heard a lot about you too.\\
173 - And, I gotta say, I am pleasantly surprised.\\
174 - Really? How so?\\
175 - Well, Alan tells me you're a judge and a professor...\\
176 - ...and, quite frankly, I wasn't expecting someone so...\\
177 - So, what, Charlie?\\
178 - Yummy.\\
179 - That was wrong, wasn't it?\\
180 - Yes, that was wrong.\\
181 - What I meant was, I was expecting you to be...\\
182 - ...more, you know, dry.\\
183 - But you're not. You're actually kind of moist.\\
184 - Oh, good Lord.\\
185 - You know what? You know what? I think I'd like to start over.\\
186 - - Hi, I'm Charlie. - Linda.\\
187 - Hi, Linda.\\
188 - I gotta tell you, I have never met a judge before.\\
189 - You know, voluntarily.\\
190 - - Better? - Anything's better than "moist."\\
191 - So how do you and Donna know each other?\\
192 - Oh, well, we met in the church choir.\\
193 - We found our kids were in the same preschool.\\
194 - Next thing, we're on the carnival committee, doing the bake sale.\\
195 - Which reminds me, I'm supposed to be snack mom next Tuesday.\\
196 - - Can you switch? - No problem.\\
197 - Thanks.\\
198 - I got nothing.\\
199 - Hey, hey. Why don't we order some drinks?\\
200 - - Just iced tea for me. - Me too.\\
201 - - Charlie, you want iced tea? - Why on Earth would I want iced tea?\\
202 - Because you don't drink alcohol during the daytime.\\
203 - Oh, right, of course not.\\
204 - Iced tea, rocks, water back.\\
205 - - Excuse me, miss? - Yes, can I help...? Charlie?\\
206 - Oh, hey. Hi.\\
207 - - How come you never called me? - Well...\\
208 - Funny story. Long story.\\
209 - Tell you later.\\
210 - - Can we get four iced teas, please? - I'll be right back.\\
211 - - Old friend? - Yeah, you know, church choir, bake sale.\\
212 - You may not wanna drink the iced tea.\\
213 - You know, Alan, I gotta hand it to you, Linda is really something.\\
214 - Yeah, yeah. She's terrific.\\
215 - - But let me ask you something. - Sure.\\
216 - What in God's name possessed you to talk about pornography?\\
217 - - Hey, she started it. - She wasn't talking about pornography.\\
218 - She was talking about constitutional law and the First Amendment.\\
219 - - Which includes pornography. - Yes, it does.\\
220 - But it does not include your favorite actresses, top 10 DVDs...\\
221 - ...or your beefs about the bonus features.\\
222 - I just pointed out that the bloopers, though funny...\\
223 - ...are really more of a turnoff.\\
224 - Hello? Yeah, yeah. Hi, Donna.\\
225 - Charlie and I were just talking about what a nice time we had.\\
226 - Okay, I'm sorry.\\
227 - I'm sorry.\\
228 - Ask her if Linda likes me.\\
229 - Hang on. You're kidding, right?\\
230 - Come on, chicks talk to each other.\\
231 - Donna, would you please tell my brother what you just told me?\\
232 - Here.\\
233 - Hey, Donna. Talk to me.\\
234 - I see. Okay, well, thanks for the heads up.\\
235 - Linda didn't like me.\\
236 - Go figure.\\
237 - I told her not to drink the iced tea.\\
238 - That's what I heard. Danny Sholander likes Jennifer Denapoli.\\
239 - Hi.\\
240 - Really? He's gay?\\
241 - Does he know that?\\
242 - You gotta get me another crack at her.\\
243 - - What? - I need to see her again.\\
244 - - See who? - Linda. I can't let it end this way.\\
245 - - Let what end? It was a lunch. - No, no, no. It was more than a lunch.\\
246 - It was a test. Is Charlie Harper capable of stepping up to quality women?\\
247 - Oh, God, we're back to third person.\\
248 - Alan, I am tired of having meaningless sex with hot pinheads.\\
249 - What a coincidence. I'm tired of hearing about it.\\
250 - Linda's smart, Linda's sophisticated, Linda's successful.\\
251 - - Linda doesn't like you. - She will. I can make her.\\
252 - You just need to tell Donna to tell Linda to give me another chance.\\
253 - Fine, I'll pass her a note during study hall.\\
254 - Hey, hey, hey, don't belittle my feelings.\\
255 - I'm in a very sensitive place and I will kick your ass.\\
256 - Look. Come on, Charlie. So you struck out with a woman. It happens.\\
257 - Believe me, it happens.\\
258 - When it does, the best thing to do is to pick yourself up, dust yourself off...\\
259 - ...and curse God for making you the way you are.\\
260 - All right, forget it. I don't need you. I'll call her myself.\\
261 - Sorry about the "curse God" stuff...\\
262 - ...but we both know I'm not your best work.\\
263 - Yeah, hi, can I speak to Judge Linda Harris please?\\
264 - Charlie Harper.\\
265 - Yes, again.\\
266 - All right, fine, put me through to voice mail.\\
267 - Banging a judge won't get you out of jury duty. Believe me, I've tried.\\
268 - No, no, no. Quiet.\\
269 - Yeah, hi, Linda. It's Charlie again.\\
270 - I just want you to know that this will be my last message.\\
271 - I figure three's a charm, four is a restraining order.\\
272 - Look who I'm telling.\\
273 - Anyway, I know we didn't get off on the right foot.\\
274 - I'm not used to spending time with such a remarkable, accomplished woman.\\
275 - Keep shoveling.\\
276 - And it's true. I've lived a certain kind of life up until now.\\
277 - I'm not saying that I'm proud of it, but I'm not ashamed of it either.\\
278 - Why else would you have videotaped most of it?\\
279 - I'm begging you.\\
280 - So if you wanna call me back, call me back.\\
281 - If not, well, have a nice life.\\
282 - But it would be a nicer life if you called me.\\
283 - Wow, I never thought I'd see Charlie Harper on his knees.\\
284 - You know, figuratively.\\
285 - Can we please talk about me in the first person?\\
286 - What's this broad got that's so special?\\
287 - - A brain. - What are you gonna do with a brain?\\
288 - It doesn't matter. She'll never call me.\\
289 - Oh, don't talk like that.\\
290 - Because she's smart and successful doesn't mean...\\
291 - ...she's not damaged enough to go out with you.\\
292 - Thanks, Berta. That means a lot.\\
293 - Hello?\\
294 - No, Jake's not here. Try him at his mom's house.\\
295 - - Where you going? - I don't know.\\
296 - Someplace where the bottles are full and the women are empty.\\
297 - And skies are not cloudy all day\\
298 - Fifty-dollar fine, time served. Call the next case.\\
299 - Case number 1217-07.\\
300 - Charles Harper, charged with drunk and disorderly, resisting arrest.\\
301 - Charlie?\\
302 - Oh, hey.\\
303 - Small world, huh?\\
304 - Approach the bench, please.\\
305 - Excuse me. I think this is personal.\\
306 - Please tell me you did not get yourself arrested just so you could see me.\\
307 - You got me.\\
308 - Charlie, what am I going to do with you?\\
309 - Have dinner with me. Otherwise, we're looking at a crime spree here.\\
310 - All right, one dinner.\\
311 - - Now step back. - Yes, ma'am.\\
312 - - How do you plead? - Guilty, Your Honor.\\
313 - - Is this a first offense? - Yes.\\
314 - - All right, $500 fine. - Five hundred dollars? Last time...\\
315 - - Last time? - Thank you, Your Honor.\\
316 - - Next case. - Case number 1217-08.\\
317 - - Heidi Jones, charged with solicitation. - Hey, Charlie.\\
318 - - Thanks for picking me up, Alan. - Where's your car?\\
319 - - Good question. - Oh, Charlie...\\
320 - Yeah, we just got my uncle out of jail. It was cool. I saw a real pimp.\\
321 - - Well, I hope you learned a lesson here. - I sure did.\\
322 - - What was that lesson? - If a woman won't return your calls...\\
323 - ...get drunk, get arrested, then lie through your teeth.\\
324 - That's it? That's what you learned?\\
325 - Well, also, if your cellmate wants your bologna sandwich, just give it to him.\\
326 - Okay, I'll be your pimp if you'll be my beyotch.\\
327 - - Jake, that's enough with the phone. - Nobody. What were you saying?\\
328 - Hey.\\
329 - I'd have kept the phone and tossed the kid.\\
330 - Resynced by Ubolena.
\subsection {Episode 04: City of Great Racks}
1 - - Thank you for a lovely dinner. - You're welcome.\\
2 - - Good night. - Wait, wait, wait.\\
3 - Are you sure you don't want me to tuck you in?\\
4 - I don't need to be tucked, Charlie.\\
5 - Oh, come on, everybody needs a good tucking once in a while.\\
6 - Well, then, go tuck yourself.\\
7 - I guess I'll have to.\\
8 - I'm not saying no. I'm just saying not now.\\
9 - I understand.\\
10 - - Good night. - Good night.\\
11 - How about now?\\
12 - Funny.\\
13 - I wasn't going for a laugh.\\
14 - Come on, Luther.\\
15 - Rose?\\
16 - No, it couldn't be.\\
17 - I'm so backed up I'm literally cockeyed.\\
18 - Hot girl at 12 o'clock.\\
19 - - Where? - Over there.\\
20 - That would be 9 o'clock.\\
21 - No, it's 12. Actually, 12:05.\\
22 - Twelve-ish.\\
23 - - Wanna straighten him out or should I? - Go ahead, take a swing.\\
24 - Okay. The reason guys say hot girl at like 12 o'clock or 3 o'clock...\\
25 - ...is to specify a location using the clock face as kind of a map.\\
26 - What if you have a digital watch?\\
27 - First of all, you're not gonna meet any women if you wear a digital watch.\\
28 - Second of all, it doesn't matter. The clock face is imaginary.\\
29 - How do you know what time you saw the girl?\\
30 - Oh, my God.\\
31 - You know what? I'm wrong. There's a hot girl and it's 12:06.\\
32 - Check.\\
33 - Hey, he likes girls and he can tell time. I'm a happy dad.\\
34 - - Hello, Your Honor, what's up? - Your Honor?\\
35 - Oh, your uncle's dating a judge.\\
36 - This weekend? Sure, that sounds great.\\
37 - - You mean like an American Idol judge? - No, a real judge.\\
38 - American Idol judges are real, Dad.\\
39 - So, what, we'd be staying in adjoining rooms?\\
40 - - No, no, no, one room is fine. - Why is he dating a judge?\\
41 - - Is he trying to get out of something? - No.\\
42 - More like he's trying to get into something.\\
43 - Good one.\\
44 - - You understood that? - Not really.\\
45 - That's how I knew it was good.\\
46 - Oh, yeah, that's a very romantic hotel. I've stayed there...\\
47 - Never in my life. Right. Okay, talk to you later.\\
48 - Santa Barbara, this weekend, one room.\\
49 - Oh, now I get it.\\
50 - - Congratulations. - Thank you.\\
51 - - Son of a gun, Alan, look. - What?\\
52 - - The blond. - Where?\\
53 - Twelve-oh-eight.\\
54 - She looks like Rose.\\
55 - It couldn't be. She's still in England, right?\\
56 - - Last I heard. - I got a postcard from her the other day.\\
57 - - Really? What did it say? - Well, let's see.\\
58 - "Dear Jake, how are you? I am fine. Hope you're doing well in school."\\
59 - I think that's a joke because she knows I struggle with my grades.\\
60 - Let's see, what else? Oh, yeah. "Say hello from England to everybody."\\
61 - Hello from England.\\
62 - Well, there you go. She's in England.\\
63 - I guess. So why do I keep thinking I see her?\\
64 - - Maybe you miss her. - I don't think so.\\
65 - I was a little down when she left, which is to be expected...\\
66 - ...but I've got Linda now and I've moved on...\\
67 - ...and why am I talking to you about my life?\\
68 - Because I'm a good listener?\\
69 - Because you have no other friends?\\
70 - - We're dropping him off at his mother's? - Yep.\\
71 - Dear Charlie, greetings from faggy old London.\\
72 - Greetings from foggy old London.\\
73 - Hope you are doing well and not working too hard.\\
74 - Things are going great for me.\\
75 - I love my job and my flat and my new friends.\\
76 - Sometimes, my life in Malibu feels like a crazy dream.\\
77 - I hope you can forgive me for all my bizarre behavior...\\
78 - ... and know that I will always remember you fondly.\\
79 - Your friend, Rose.\\
80 - P.S., Give my best to Alan.\\
81 - I'm sure by now he's found a place of his own.\\
82 - - What you got there? - It's a letter from Rose.\\
83 - Really? That come today?\\
84 - No, a few months ago. I just never got around to reading it.\\
85 - I noticed you didn't toss it out.\\
86 - - What's that supposed to mean? - Charlie.\\
87 - Of all the broads who've staggered...\\
88 - ...bare-assed through these hallowed halls...\\
89 - ...she's the one who really got to you.\\
90 - Yeah, she got to me.\\
91 - She put a sleeping pill in my Scotch and superglued my testicles to my leg.\\
92 - You just can't get past that, can you?\\
93 - Well, it doesn't matter.\\
94 - I'm in a real relationship now with an incredible woman.\\
95 - A judge, a constitutional scholar.\\
96 - A woman who may one day be a state senator.\\
97 - But does she care enough to line her mittens...\\
98 - ...with hair she collects from your shower drain?\\
99 - I don't know yet. We're going slow.\\
100 - - Really? - Yes.\\
101 - Getting to know each other as people before we jump into bed...\\
102 - ...and get to know each other as, you know, animals.\\
103 - Just do me a favor and make the first time at her place...\\
104 - ...because you're gonna spring forth like a Water Wiggle.\\
105 - Charlie?\\
106 - - Charlie? - What?\\
107 - I need your help.\\
108 - If you're doing laundry, all I can say is you're doing it wrong.\\
109 - No, no, the lady I've been seeing, you know, Linda's friend Donna?\\
110 - She wants to... How shall we say?\\
111 - Take it up a notch.\\
112 - - Yeah, so? - I'm out of notches.\\
113 - - What do you need? - A younger man's penis.\\
114 - My night stand, top drawer, next to the Ping-Pong paddle.\\
115 - Take one with water and stall for 20 minutes.\\
116 - Thanks.\\
117 - - Alan? - Yeah?\\
118 - - Don't those hurt? - Hell, yeah.\\
119 - - Why don't you take them off? - There's a penalty involved.\\
120 - Long story.\\
121 - I can tell you how it ends.\\
122 - - Lovely dinner. - Yeah. Food was great.\\
123 - - It's a beautiful room. - Yeah. Room's great.\\
124 - Nice view.\\
125 - Yep, view's great.\\
126 - Oh, for God's sake.\\
127 - - Who is it? - Room service, se or.\\
128 - We didn't order anything.\\
129 - It's champagne. Compliments of the hotel.\\
130 - - Can you slip it under the door? - Charlie.\\
131 - Don't move. Don't change your mind.\\
132 - - Do you want I open? - No, thank you.\\
133 - Okay, good night.\\
134 - Charlie.\\
135 - - Yeah? - I'm waiting.\\
136 - For what?\\
137 - Oh, right.\\
138 - Hang on.\\
139 - What are you doing to the rose?\\
140 - I just don't want it looking at me.\\
141 - - Anything interesting going on in school? - I started algebra.\\
142 - Oh, how's that going?\\
143 - I don't get it at all, but the teacher's really hot.\\
144 - - Well, that's nice. - Yeah, she's got some really great racks.\\
145 - I think you mean rack.\\
146 - No, she's got two, and they're ginormous.\\
147 - It's kind of cool that she's teaching algebra.\\
148 - Nothing?\\
149 - Boy, that killed in detention.\\
150 - - Oh, hey, how was Santa Barbara? - Santa Bar-bra?\\
151 - It's Spanish for "City of Great Racks."\\
152 - Alan, I got no patience for your kid today.\\
153 - Go do your homework.\\
154 - Oh, right. I have a big reading ass-ignment.\\
155 - You're not my audience.\\
156 - - Remember when he was cute? - The memory is fading.\\
157 - So how was your big night with Linda?\\
158 - - Fine. - Just fine?\\
159 - Yes. Just fine.\\
160 - Oh, I see.\\
161 - No, you don't.\\
162 - All right.\\
163 - - Wanna talk about it? - Oh, golly, Alan, more than anything.\\
164 - Okay, never mind. Stew in it.\\
165 - Thank you.\\
166 - I finally got to step up to the plate and I was swinging a garden hose.\\
167 - You happy?\\
168 - Well, I'm not sad.\\
169 - What do you think the problem was?\\
170 - I saw her again.\\
171 - - Saw who? - Rose.\\
172 - She brought champagne to our hotel room...\\
173 - ...except this time, she was Hispanic.\\
174 - What was she last time?\\
175 - Last time, she was a blond with coffee...\\
176 - ...and before that, she was a redhead with a dog.\\
177 - - What kind of dog? - What difference does it make?\\
178 - I like dogs.\\
179 - Go on.\\
180 - If I didn't know any better, I'd say she was stalking me again.\\
181 - - From England? - We don't know she's in England.\\
182 - She sends letters and postcards. Jake gets them all the time.\\
183 - Like she couldn't leave a stack of them with some friend to mail every few days.\\
184 - Oh, wow, are you listening to yourself? Even Rose isn't that crazy.\\
185 - Oh, and she's gonna fly back and forth with a dog?\\
186 - She could hire a local dog.\\
187 - Charlie, Rose is in England. She's not stalking you.\\
188 - And whatever you think you're seeing is in your head.\\
189 - Yeah, you're probably right.\\
190 - Regardless, last night was less than a triumph.\\
191 - Why didn't you just take one of your pills?\\
192 - Because somebody else took my last three.\\
193 - Oh, yeah.\\
194 - Thank you.\\
195 - Thank you, thank you, thank you.\\
196 - That's four.\\
197 - The first one was a twofer.\\
198 - - What kind of dog? - I don't know, it was a dog.\\
199 - Four legs and a tail. Can we please get back to my problem?\\
200 - Not a dog person.\\
201 - So you believe you're seeing people who aren't there?\\
202 - No, no, no.\\
203 - They're there, but they're not who they are.\\
204 - Well, then, who are they?\\
205 - I don't know who they are, but they all look like Rose.\\
206 - - Your stalker. - Well, that's kind of harsh.\\
207 - You told me she broke into your home...\\
208 - ...disrobed and handcuffed herself to your refrigerator.\\
209 - Just the one time.\\
210 - So why do I keep seeing her everywhere I go?\\
211 - Well, Charlie, if I tell you that now, what'll we do for the rest of the hour?\\
212 - I'm joshing.\\
213 - Why don't we talk about your current relationship?\\
214 - Linda? Well, let's see. She's a municipal-court judge.\\
215 - - Very impressive. - Thank you.\\
216 - I meant for her, Charlie.\\
217 - It's hardly your accomplishment now, is it?\\
218 - Well, yeah, in a way. I've never done a judge before.\\
219 - Well, from what you told me, you still haven't.\\
220 - Touch .\\
221 - Pays to listen.\\
222 - - So how old is Linda? - She's about my age.\\
223 - First time you've been with a woman that old?\\
224 - Oh, no, not at all.\\
225 - So you've had age-appropriate relationships before?\\
226 - Relationships? No, no, are you crazy?\\
227 - Am I crazy? Pot, kettle, Charlie.\\
228 - Okay, look, I didn't come to therapy to talk this to death.\\
229 - I've seen Rose three times and it's ruining my sex life with Linda.\\
230 - Can you help me or do I have to learn to shoot pool with a rope?\\
231 - Well, thank you for that disturbing image.\\
232 - Best I can tell, for the first time in your life...\\
233 - ...you are involved in an adult relationship.\\
234 - It's challenging, maybe even a little intimidating.\\
235 - And the fact that you're fantasizing about a woman in England...\\
236 - ...who idolized you beyond all rational measure...\\
237 - ...well, that tells me that you're afraid to grow up.\\
238 - And we call that the Peter Pan syndrome.\\
239 - That's pretty good.\\
240 - So, what can we do, you know, Peter-wise?\\
241 - If you're committed to personal growth, you'll walk through your fear...\\
242 - ...and embrace the challenges of a really meaningful relationship...\\
243 - ...with an adult woman.\\
244 - And your only other choice is to live the emotionally stunted life...\\
245 - ...you've been living over and over.\\
246 - Never growing, never changing.\\
247 - Good afternoon, and welcome aboard British Airways Flight 471...\\
248 - ... nonstop to London 's Heathrow Airport.\\
249 - Charlie.\\
250 - Surprise.\\
251 - What are you doing here?\\
252 - I'm not sure. I just needed to see you.\\
253 - I need to talk to you. I can come back if now is not a good time.\\
254 - No, no, it's okay.\\
255 - I know you've probably moved on. I thought I had too...\\
256 - ...but everywhere I look, I keep seeing your face...\\
257 - ...so I started thinking, maybe...\\
258 - I don't know what I'm thinking. Are you busy?\\
259 - Can I take you out for a cold beer or something?\\
260 - Actually, on this side of the pond, we drink our beer warm.\\
261 - You can still catch a buzz, right?\\
262 - - Oh, yeah. - Then warm's fine.\\
263 - Okay.\\
264 - - Well, I'll just get my purse. - Great.\\
265 - So I'm not screwing up any plans of yours?\\
266 - Oh, no. This fits perfectly into my plans.\\
267 - - Oh, Linda, hi. - Hi, Alan.\\
268 - I'm sorry to show up unannounced, but Charlie hasn't been answering his phone.\\
269 - And I wanted to make sure he's okay.\\
270 - Oh, Charlie's fine. We have a pharmacy that delivers.\\
271 - What?\\
272 - - Nothing, nothing. Come on in. - Thanks.\\
273 - He should be getting up sometime soon, anyway.\\
274 - So how are things with you and Donna?\\
275 - Good, good.\\
276 - I'll go get Charlie.\\
277 - Hey, Dad, girls' volleyball. Lot of bouncing boobs.\\
278 - - Not now, Jake. - You told me to tell you.\\
279 - - I didn't. - Yes, you did.\\
280 - Shut up.\\
281 - Oh, hey.\\
282 - - Hello. You must be Jake. - Yeah, who are you?\\
283 - Linda. I'm a friend of your Uncle Charlie's.\\
284 - Are you the judge?\\
285 - - Do you play volleyball? - No. Do you?\\
286 - No, I just like to watch them jump up and down.\\
287 - Okay. Heigh-ho, go away.\\
288 - I thought Charlie was asleep, but he's not in his room.\\
289 - Berta, have you seen Charlie?\\
290 - - He's not in his bed? - No.\\
291 - - Passed out on the bathroom floor? - No.\\
292 - - Rubbing oil on the volleyball girls? - No.\\
293 - Well, that just leaves the bars, hospitals and jails.\\
294 - I'll go get the yellow pages.\\
295 - Well, he couldn't have gone very far.\\
296 - Hey, Dad. Hot girl in a thong.\\
297 - What time is it?\\
298 - Tepid.\\
299 - So London certainly agrees with you, Rose.\\
300 - - You look beautiful. - Thank you, Charlie.\\
301 - I just can't believe you're here.\\
302 - Yeah, well, I wanted you to know I've been thinking a lot about you lately...\\
303 - ...and I miss you.\\
304 - Oh, Charlie, I miss you too.\\
305 - Are you seeing anybody?\\
306 - Actually, I am seeing someone, but I'm not really sure where it's going yet.\\
307 - - You? - To be honest...\\
308 - ...there is one lady I've been dating.\\
309 - She's actually my own age.\\
310 - - No. - Yeah.\\
311 - But my therapist says she's not good for me.\\
312 - And you think I am?\\
313 - Well, you've always loved me for who I am instead of who I could be...\\
314 - ...which is really wonderful, because, let's face it...\\
315 - ...we both love who I am.\\
316 - I do love you, Charlie.\\
317 - Great.\\
318 - So?\\
319 - So what?\\
320 - So, what's next?\\
321 - What do you mean?\\
322 - Well, you can't expect me to go back to what we had without a commitment.\\
323 - - A commitment? - Yes.\\
324 - I think we should get married.\\
325 - Married?\\
326 - Sell the house in Malibu...\\
327 - ...and move to a kid-friendly neighborhood here in London.\\
328 - Kid?\\
329 - Kids.\\
330 - We're gonna have kids, aren't we?\\

\subsection {Episode 05: Putting Swim Fins on a Cat}
1 - - Hey. - Hey, what are you doing home?\\
2 - Linda's spending time with her son tonight.\\
3 - Apparently she's one of those single moms that puts her kid first.\\
4 - The bitch.\\
5 - You're just saying that because our mom put us third.\\
6 - Fourth after she got the Datsun 280Z.\\
7 - So, what you doing?\\
8 - Paying our household bills.\\
9 - You're a good wife, Alan.\\
10 - I can't believe some lucky fella hasn't snapped you up.\\
11 - Probably the penis.\\
12 - That's usually a deal breaker.\\
13 - So how are we doing, bill-wise?\\
14 - Not very well.\\
15 - Are you aware you haven't had a paying job in over nine months?\\
16 - Are you aware that urine cures athlete's foot?\\
17 - Seriously, you've got a big pile of bills and no money coming in.\\
18 - Seriously, no burning, no itching, just clears it right up.\\
19 - The drug companies don't want you to know about it because it's free.\\
20 - Charlie, you're unemployed.\\
21 - I know. Haven't you heard? The jingle business is dead.\\
22 - How would I hear that? Who would have told me?\\
23 - It was in all the jingle magazines.\\
24 - You know, before they went out of business.\\
25 - Everybody's using old rock songs now.\\
26 - They're not gonna hire me to write a jingle for tampons...\\
27 - ...when they can just play "Stuck in the Middle With You."\\
28 - But...\\
29 - This doesn't concern you at all?\\
30 - - No, something will turn up. - How can you be so sure?\\
31 - Hey, do you have any idea how I got in the jingle business?\\
32 - - No. - Neither do I.\\
33 - But look how good that worked out.\\
34 - Charlie, you cannot depend on the kindness of the universe.\\
35 - I have to.\\
36 - I don't have an older brother I can sponge off of.\\
37 - Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go pee on my feet.\\
38 - Okay.\\
39 - Oh, crap.\\
40 - - Berta, you got a minute? - What's on your mind, princess?\\
41 - Well, first and foremost...\\
42 - ...you know that we consider you a beloved member of this family.\\
43 - Alan, you can roll manure in powdered sugar, but it still ain't a jelly doughnut.\\
44 - Now see, right there...\\
45 - ...that's one of the things that we love about you, you know.\\
46 - - Folksy... - Spill it, Mildred.\\
47 - Right, right, well, I'm not sure you're aware of this...\\
48 - ...but it has been quite some time since Charlie has had any actual income.\\
49 - Okay.\\
50 - And I can't help but notice...\\
51 - ...that you're the only beloved family member actually drawing a salary.\\
52 - I'm also the only beloved family member...\\
53 - ...who takes a toothbrush to your kid's skivvies.\\
54 - And we can never begin to repay you for that.\\
55 - But during these difficult financial times, we all have...\\
56 - For the record, it's not my toothbrush, right?\\
57 - Not right now, but cut my pay and all bets are off.\\
58 - Oh, come on, Berta, be reasonable.\\
59 - This might be more than just a temporary dry spell for Charlie.\\
60 - Look, I know things may seem dark right now...\\
61 - ...but I've known Charlie a lot longer than you have.\\
62 - - Technically, that's not true. - Are you gonna let me talk?\\
63 - Sorry.\\
64 - One thing I've learned working for Mr. Charles Roscoe Harper...\\
65 - - His middle name isn't Roscoe. - Who's telling the story?\\
66 - Continue.\\
67 - Anyway, what I've learned is God takes care of drunks and fools.\\
68 - And C. Roscoe Harper is both.\\
69 - His middle name is Francis.\\
70 - Hi, what's going on?\\
71 - Trying to save you a little money here.\\
72 - Good man, appreciate it.\\
73 - Check out what I bought Linda.\\
74 - Diamond earrings?\\
75 - She's a classy woman, Alan.\\
76 - She's not gonna be impressed with a continental breakfast...\\
77 - ...and a copy of the video.\\
78 - Be that as it may, you can't keep spending money you don't have.\\
79 - Oh, relax. Something will turn up.\\
80 - Will you stop saying that? Things don't just turn up.\\
81 - You're living in a dream world. Money doesn't just fall from the sky.\\
82 - Obviously you've never been sitting ringside...\\
83 - ...when a pole dancer hangs upside down.\\
84 - So did you buy this for your girlfriend because you're breaking up with her?\\
85 - No, why would you think that?\\
86 - Because you always give jewelry to girls you're getting ready to dump.\\
87 - Very observant.\\
88 - You watch, you learn.\\
89 - Well, this isn't breakup jewelry, this is "I like you, stick around" jewelry.\\
90 - - What's the difference? - About 1500 bucks.\\
91 - But let's back up a step.\\
92 - A gentleman never dumps a lady.\\
93 - He merely acknowledges the fact that a relationship has run its course...\\
94 - ...by presenting her with a memento...\\
95 - ...a keepsake if you will, of their time together.\\
96 - Remember that big blond who threw the toaster oven at you?\\
97 - Yeah, I remember.\\
98 - Oh, and that yoga teacher...\\
99 - ...who chucked the fire extinguisher through your windshield.\\
100 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
101 - - There was that actress who set fire... - It's not a perfect system, Jake.\\
102 - Oh, Charlie, they're beautiful.\\
103 - You do realize I was going to sleep with you tonight anyway.\\
104 - This is just a little bonus.\\
105 - Like when you get to a baseball game and find out it's helmet night.\\
106 - You silver-tongued devil.\\
107 - Well, I don't know about silver, but you'll find I am tongued.\\
108 - If you ignore that, there's a matching necklace in it for you.\\
109 - Why don't you open the wine?\\
110 - Gary, what are you doing here?\\
111 - I'm sorry, I tried to call but your line's been busy.\\
112 - My line's been busy? I haven't been on the phone.\\
113 - Well, I must have called 20 times.\\
114 - Fine. What do you want?\\
115 - I have to work tonight and I can't take Brandon.\\
116 - - But I have company. - And I have an emergency board meeting.\\
117 - - Who are you? - I'm Charlie.\\
118 - I'm Brandon.\\
119 - Nice to meet you, Brandon.\\
120 - You know, I have a nephew about your age.\\
121 - Hey, Dad, did you get Mom a present when you got divorced?\\
122 - A present?\\
123 - Yeah, a memento of your time together.\\
124 - Jake, buddy, you're the memento of our time together.\\
125 - So you were too cheap to get her earrings.\\
126 - She did better than earrings.\\
127 - She got my family jewels.\\
128 - - Hi, honey. - Hi, Mom.\\
129 - When you die, do I get Dad's family jewels?\\
130 - - What? - Nothing, just go inside.\\
131 - - Okay, well, thanks for dropping him off. - Judith, hang on a second.\\
132 - What?\\
133 - - How's it going? - Good.\\
134 - So your new marriage going well? Herb's okay?\\
135 - What do you want, Alan?\\
136 - Charlie's business is dead, I'm gonna be homeless.\\
137 - Well, you can't stay here.\\
138 - Oh, no, no, that's not what I was getting at...\\
139 - ...but it's good to know that door is firmly closed.\\
140 - No, what I was hoping was that we could talk about the child support.\\
141 - What about my child support?\\
142 - Well, technically, it's Jake's child support, hence the term "child."\\
143 - But I just thought maybe we could make some trims.\\
144 - For instance, the karate classes, the archery lessons...\\
145 - ...the algebra tutor.\\
146 - I mean, I don't know about you, but I've never seen him...\\
147 - ...you know, break a board or string a bow.\\
148 - And the algebra tutor, I mean, who are we kidding?\\
149 - That's like putting swim fins on a cat.\\
150 - He needs the tutor, he likes the lessons and I'm not gonna ask Herb to pay.\\
151 - - That's okay, I'll ask him. Is he home? - Goodbye, Alan.\\
152 - How about I stay in Jake's tree house? He never uses it.\\
153 - Kid doesn't even like to climb stairs.\\
154 - Come on, sweetheart, just one little bite.\\
155 - Nope.\\
156 - He's usually not this cranky.\\
157 - Have you tried a little whiskey in his sippy cup?\\
158 - - Charlie. - I'm just saying, it worked for my brother.\\
159 - - You really did that? - Still do it.\\
160 - You know what, I'm just gonna make him a hot dog.\\
161 - - You want a hot dog? - Sure.\\
162 - - I was talking to my son. - What, you just got the one?\\
163 - I'll be right back.\\
164 - Come on, kid, just have a little corn and then bedtime.\\
165 - - For both of us. - No.\\
166 - Oh, for the love of God.\\
167 - I don't come to Gymboree and knock the blocks out of your hand.\\
168 - Come on.\\
169 - It's corntastic.\\
170 - I like corn It tastes real sweet\\
171 - I don 't like peas They taste like feet\\
172 - Corn 's the king Of the veggie-food group\\
173 - And it looks the same When it's in your poop\\
174 - Son of a bitch.\\
175 - I mean, golly.\\
176 - Yeah.\\
177 - Hi, Mom.\\
178 - Hello, Alan.\\
179 - Got a minute?\\
180 - Sure.\\
181 - I mean, could you come to the door?\\
182 - No.\\
183 - Please, Mom, it's important. I'm having a real crisis here.\\
184 - Oh, darling, I'm so sorry.\\
185 - Well, good luck with that.\\
186 - Mom, please.\\
187 - I'm such a pushover.\\
188 - The money isn't just for me. It's for Charlie and your only grandson.\\
189 - I'll just be a minute, Teddy.\\
190 - What can I do for you, Alan?\\
191 - Nothing. Never mind.\\
192 - What? I'm not entitled to a love life?\\
193 - I'm ready for my punishment, headmaster.\\
194 - So you must be getting tired, huh?\\
195 - No shame in calling it a night.\\
196 - I gotta go pee-pee.\\
197 - All right, go ahead.\\
198 - First pee-pee then beddy-bye. Beats the other way around, trust me.\\
199 - I gotta go pee-pee now.\\
200 - Linda, he says he's gotta go pee-pee.\\
201 - - Would you mind taking him? - Me?\\
202 - He can't undo his pants and I'm doing the dishes.\\
203 - Fine, let's go pee-pee.\\
204 - Don't feel bad.\\
205 - I can't always undo my pants either.\\
206 - - What are you waiting for? - I don't have to anymore.\\
207 - Linda, he says he doesn't have to anymore.\\
208 - Trust me, he has to.\\
209 - - You heard the lady, let her rip. - No.\\
210 - Okay, okay, how about this?\\
211 - You're a giant, and there's a tiny village in the toilet bowl that's on fire...\\
212 - ...and you have to put it out by whizzing all over it.\\
213 - Hey, look.\\
214 - Here comes the giant now.\\
215 - I had a root beer I had a Coke\\
216 - I need to pee Hey, I smell smoke\\
217 - Giant, giant Up in the sky\\
218 - Grab your fire hose Let it fly\\
219 - Close your windows Lock your doors\\
220 - Because when I rain It really pours\\
221 - There you go.\\
222 - Hey, hey, hey, I'm the only one who gets to pee on my feet.\\
223 - Come on, buddy, right in here.\\
224 - Hey, Berta, look what I got.\\
225 - Big deal. It's a freaking miracle you don't have 10 of them.\\
226 - This is Linda's son, Brandon.\\
227 - I'm Brandon.\\
228 - I got ears.\\
229 - So, what's he doing here?\\
230 - - I'm babysitting. - You?\\
231 - - Why not me? - You're a rum-soaked degenerate.\\
232 - Yeah, but it turns out I have child skills.\\
233 - I already got him to eat his vegetables and make pee-pee in the toilet.\\
234 - So, "Do as I say, not as I do," huh?\\
235 - Are you gonna help me or what?\\
236 - Hey, his mom's not throwing me any.\\
237 - Don't get the wrong idea.\\
238 - Your mom and I are actually in a committed relationship.\\
239 - So if I sign up for this drug trial...\\
240 - ...I take these pills not knowing...\\
241 - ...if I'm getting the anxiety medication or a placebo?\\
242 - That's correct.\\
243 - The test group gets the actual medication...\\
244 - ...and the control group is being given sugar pills.\\
245 - So is there anything I should know about?\\
246 - Any side effects or anything?\\
247 - Well, that's one of the purposes of the research.\\
248 - But in tests of this nature, common side effects include:\\
249 - "Dry mouth, hair loss, blurred vision, inflamed gums."\\
250 - - Okay. - " Mild nausea.\\
251 - Heart palpitations, liver damage.\\
252 - Boils, shingles, sudden fainting...\\
253 - ...and temporary darkening of the stool."\\
254 - Good Lord.\\
255 - How much do you pay people to do this?\\
256 - - A thousand dollars a week. - I'm in.\\
257 - Hey, hey, hey.\\
258 - That's not a toy.\\
259 - That's how I make my living. Not so much anymore, but still, be careful.\\
260 - I wanna play.\\
261 - All right.\\
262 - Play this one.\\
263 - And this one.\\
264 - That's great.\\
265 - Now it's my turn.\\
266 - This is a little tune I wrote for my nephew when he was feeling down in the dumps.\\
267 - I know that the winter Follows the fall\\
268 - And in New York The buildings are tall\\
269 - I hear that in China They have a Great Wall\\
270 - I know these things and more\\
271 - But there's just one answer I'm still looking for\\
272 - Who cut the cheese? Who cut the cheese?\\
273 - I ask you, please Did you cut the cheese?\\
274 - I'm not averse to learnin ' Tell me why my eyes are burnin '\\
275 - Who cut the cheese?\\
276 - Everybody.\\
277 - Who cut the cheese? Who cut the cheese?\\
278 - I ask you, please Did you cut the cheese?\\
279 - I'm not averse to learnin ' Tell me why my eyes are burnin '\\
280 - Who cut the cheese?\\
281 - I can't thank you enough.\\
282 - No problem, we had fun.\\
283 - Look, after I drop him off at his dad's, why don't I come back...\\
284 - ...and show my appreciation for those earrings?\\
285 - Gee, I'd love to, but it's been a long day.\\
286 - I just wanna soak in a hot bath and have a little me time.\\
287 - Oh, come on, Charlie.\\
288 - Hey, hey, hey, while you were off having fun at work...\\
289 - ...I was cooped up all day in this house taking care of your child.\\
290 - Okay, sorry.\\
291 - I'm just saying I'm not a light switch.\\
292 - I'll call you later.\\
293 - Oh, wait, wait. I made something for Brandon.\\
294 - I sang some songs for him, he seemed to like them...\\
295 - ...so I burned them onto a CD.\\
296 - Oh, how sweet.\\
297 - Sweet? Clearly you're not familiar with my work.\\
298 - Anyway, he seemed to dig them.\\
299 - Well, thank you.\\
300 - Hi, Alan.\\
301 - Hi.\\
302 - I don't think I'm in the control group.\\
303 - Are you really sure you should be taking those pills with beer?\\
304 - What else can happen to me, Charlie?\\
305 - My hair is coming out, I'm having fainting spells...\\
306 - ...I can see my heart beating through my shirt...\\
307 - ...and my poop looks like charcoal briquettes.\\
308 - So stop taking the medication.\\
309 - It's $ 1000 a week. We need the money.\\
310 - Oh, relax. Something will turn up.\\
311 - Something's already turned up.\\
312 - I'm pretty sure I dropped a third testicle.\\
313 - Hello?\\
314 - Hang on.\\
315 - It's Linda's ex-husband. He wants to talk to you.\\
316 - - I don't wanna talk to him, talk to him. - I'm not gonna.\\
317 - Come on. You've got 30 percent more balls than I do.\\
318 - Hello? Yeah, this is Charlie.\\
319 - What about Brandon?\\
320 - Oh, good, good, I'm glad he likes the songs.\\
321 - Yeah, Linda mentioned you were in the music business.\\
322 - Well, that's flattering, but I already have a very lucrative career writing jingles.\\
323 - I don't see myself walking away from that to record children's songs.\\
324 - How much?\\
325 - I'm in.\\
326 - How about that? Something turned up.\\
327 - Send the papers over.\\

2 - - Sure. - They're called Bucket of Hate.\\
3 - What do you think?\\
4 - Nice beat.\\
5 - Oh, my goodness.\\
6 - Quite a mouth on this fella.\\
7 - I guess that's why they're not called Bucket of Bunnies, huh?\\
8 - - Who's he listening to? - Bucket of Hate.\\
9 - They're good. Reminds me of early Who.\\
10 - - Who? What? - Yeah.\\
11 - - The band's called Who. - Bucket of Hate.\\

15 - It means to honor thy father.\\
16 - Oh, well, then that song doesn't make sense.\\
17 - Yeah, well, I'm still trying to figure out what a su-su-sudio is.\\

25 - He's 17, and he's never been in an accident that was his fault.\\
26 - I don't think so.\\
27 - Why not?\\
28 - Why don't I think it's appropriate for a 13-year-old to go with no supervision?\\
29 - I told you. Rocco is 17.\\
30 - - His name is Rocco? - Yeah.\\
31 - So Rocco Friedman?\\
32 - Yeah. Do you know him?\\
33 - No, but I'm not letting someone named Rocco Friedman drive you...\\

37 - No way in hell.\\
38 - Oh, man.\\
39 - - What's going on? - My dad sucks.\\
40 - You know, in certain primitive cultures, when a boy hits puberty...\\
41 - ...they tie him to a big rock, and throw him in the ocean.\\

52 - Oh, right.\\
53 - Yeah, I don't think I'm going to that.\\
54 - Why not?\\

60 - You do suck.\\
61 - God, Charlie, you are great.\\
62 - No.\\
63 - I'm serious.\\
64 - You are the best lover I have ever had.\\
65 - It's probably just the flawless technique and the big penis.\\
66 - Probably.\\
67 - I was wondering.\\
68 - - You got any plans next Saturday? - Next Saturday?\\
69 - Oh, as a matter of fact, I do.\\
70 - What might they be?\\
71 - The plans?\\
72 - Just some business thing. Very boring.\\
73 - - Business. - Yeah, business.\\
74 - Might this be the business we're speaking of?\\
75 - "Dilbert"?\\
76 - This?\\
77 - Oh, that.\\
78 - Oh, I can explain.\\
79 - I would love an explanation.\\
80 - Well, I just thought it wouldn't be your kind of thing.\\
81 - You know, it's just judges, lawyers, local politicians.\\
82 - - Are you going with somebody else? - No.\\
83 - So you'd rather go alone than take me?\\
84 - I know it seems that way.\\
85 - - You're ashamed of me, aren't you? - Oh, no, Charlie.\\
86 - Sure, you can use me for sex, but God forbid we're out in public together.\\
87 - That is not true.\\
88 - And let me remind you.\\
89 - It's the best sex you've ever had.\\
90 - - Charlie... - Your words, not mine.\\
91 - Look, the last thing in the world I wanna do is hurt your feelings.\\
92 - Well, you have.\\
93 - Would you like to go with me to the banquet?\\
94 - No. I don't wanna go where I'm not wanted.\\

96 - Please come with me to the banquet.\\
97 - A little more.\\
98 - Pretty please?\\
99 - Come with me.\\
100 - All right.\\
101 - But then we gotta talk about this banquet thing.\\
102 - Jake, do you want Grandmommy to teach you how to use chopsticks?\\
103 - Don't confuse him. He just learned how to use a fork.\\
104 - Real funny, Alan.\\
105 - Alan? What happened to Dad?\\
106 - He turned into Benito Mussoroni.\\
107 - The San Francisco treat?\\
108 - It's Mussolini, professor.\\
109 - He's upset, I won't let him go to a concert.\\
110 - - Why not? - Because there's no adult supervision.\\
111 - Oh, don't be such a fuddy-duddy, Alan.\\
112 - He's a teenager. Teenagers don't go to concerts with their parents.\\
113 - I'm with Evelyn on this.\\
114 - Forget it. You are not going to the concert.\\
115 - Oh, listen to you.\\
116 - Remember I said you couldn't go to that Peter Frampton concert?\\
117 - You snuck out of the house and went anyway.\\
118 - - Really? - Mom, no.\\
119 - I was in Martinique at the time, but the housekeeper was beside herself.\\
120 - And I was severely punished for that, right?\\
121 - Oh, sure, I tried grounding you, and taking away TV privileges.\\
122 - But at a certain point, every parent has to accept that they're powerless...\\
123 - ...when it comes to controlling a teenager.\\
124 - - Really? - No.\\
125 - No, not really.\\
126 - Parents are powerful, very powerful.\\
127 - No, no:\\
128 - No, trust me. I'm only doing this for your own good.\\
129 - What the hell was that?\\
130 - The same thing Grandma did.\\
131 - No, it's not. You sound like you're coughing up a fur ball.\\
132 - Yeah, well, I'm making the same point.\\
133 - Did it even occur to you that you could help me?\\
134 - I was not put on this Earth to help you, Alan.\\
135 - You're my mother.\\
136 - Yes, and as you never tire of pointing out, not a good one.\\
137 - Hey, Alan, do we have any snack bars?\\
138 - Right-hand cabinet. Why?\\
139 - Oh, I need something to soak up the booze...\\
140 - ...I'll have to drink to make it through this dinner.\\
141 - What's the occasion?\\
142 - My girlfriend is being honored at a banquet.\\
143 - Oh, I thought the Adult Film Awards were in Vegas.\\
144 - She happens to be a judge.\\
145 - Of the Adult Film Awards?\\
146 - No. No.\\
147 - A judge in the Los Angeles Municipal Court.\\
148 - So do I look okay?\\
149 - It's a tuxedo. You can't go wrong.\\
150 - I wanna fit in. This is a very conservative crowd.\\
151 - Well, then you can go wrong.\\
152 - Thanks. Like I'm not nervous?\\
153 - Oh, sweetheart, if you're nervous, just try one of these. It'll relax you.\\
154 - Oh, perfect.\\
155 - Charlie, you just can't pop a pill without knowing what it is.\\
156 - She just said what it is. Thanks, Mom, gotta go.\\
157 - Bye, sweetheart. Have a good time with your judge, darling.\\
158 - That will last.\\
159 - I don't know. I think he's really trying on this one.\\
160 - What?\\
161 - Nothing.\\
162 - Guess I'll just have to watch my DVD of Fantasia on the natch tonight.\\
163 - Congratulations, Your Honor.\\
164 - - Well deserved. - Oh, thank you, councilman.\\
165 - I'd like you to meet my friend Charlie Harper.\\
166 - Charlie, this is Councilman Stewart.\\
167 - - Charlie? - Yeah, hi. How are you?\\
168 - Again, congratulations.\\
169 - Thanks.\\
170 - Charlie, are you okay?\\
171 - I'm wonderful.\\
172 - Look at all the colors.\\
173 - It's like I'm drinking a rainbow.\\
174 - Hang on. He's probably in his room.\\
175 - Jake, your mom's on the phone.\\
176 - Jake?\\
177 - Jake?\\
178 - Son of a bitch.\\
179 - - Alan, what's going on? Are you all right? - What?\\
180 - Oh, I stubbed my toe.\\
181 - Yeah, yeah. It may be broken.\\
182 - Yeah, I'm gonna go to the emergency room.\\
183 - Oh, no, no, I have to take Jake with me...\\
184 - ...so we can go in the carpool lane.\\
185 - Jake, help Daddy find his toenail.\\
186 - I'll have him call you later, okay?\\
187 - Son of a bitch.\\
188 - So without further ado, here's our guest of honor...\\
189 - ...Judge of the Year, and I'm proud to say my good friend...\\
190 - ...Judge Linda Harris. - Yeah.\\
191 - Yeah.\\
192 - Who the judge? You the judge.\\
193 - I'm hitting that.\\
194 - Los Angeles, thank you.\\
195 - Hey, look who's here.\\
196 - Keep it down.\\
197 - Right, we don't wanna wake me.\\
198 - What are you doing sitting out here?\\
199 - I can't stand up.\\
200 - Don't make a thing out of it.\\
201 - What are you doing?\\
202 - I snuck out to see a concert.\\
203 - No way.\\
204 - That is so cool.\\
205 - Okay.\\
206 - Third time's the charm.\\
207 - Hey, wanna know what else is cool?\\
208 - Check this out.\\
209 - Hey, hey, I'm caroling here.\\
210 - You should be bringing me Cocoa and Gingerbread.\\
211 - Cocoa and gingerbread?\\
212 - Yeah.\\
213 - They work at the Spearmint Rhino.\\
214 - But I digress.\\
215 - - Where were we? - My dad doesn't know I went out.\\
216 - So now I have to sneak back in.\\
217 - Well, then you certainly don't wanna go through this door.\\
218 - - Why not? - Why not?\\
219 - I'll tell you why not.\\
220 - - What? - Why not?\\
221 - Why not what?\\
222 - Why can't I go through that door?\\
223 - Oh, well, why didn't you say so?\\
224 - If I know your dad, and sadly I do...\\
225 - ...he's sitting in there right now, just waiting to tie you to a rock...\\
226 - ...and throw you in the ocean.\\
227 - What?\\
228 - Sorry. I may have put the idea in his head.\\
229 - Follow me.\\
230 - - Where are we going? - Hey, I'll ask the questions.\\
231 - Where are we going?\\
232 - All right.\\
233 - I'm okay.\\
234 - Here, grab my... What do you call it?\\
235 - - Hand.\\
236 - I'm okay.\\
237 - That's great. But you're sitting on my head.\\
238 - Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in?\\
239 - I do not.\\
240 - Do you have any idea how beautiful you look in that light?\\
241 - - I'm not talking to you. - Well, I'm not talking to you either.\\
242 - Except for right now.\\
243 - This is me talking to you, but no longer.\\
244 - Would you please just go to sleep?\\
245 - Okey-dokey.\\
246 - - You and I have some talking to do. - Will you make up your freaking mind?\\
247 - Morning.\\
248 - What? You're not talking to me?\\
249 - I looked up patricide.\\
250 - Really?\\
251 - When did you learn to spell?\\
252 - I sounded it out.\\
253 - Patricide, huh?\\
254 - Our little boy is growing up.\\
255 - He's just upset because he snuck out.\\
256 - So I grounded him for three months.\\
257 - - That ought to show him. - What am I gonna do, Berta?\\
258 - - I can't hit him. - Well, sure you can.\\
259 - You just gotta figure the wind, and lead him.\\
260 - They're like pheasants.\\
261 - Very funny.\\
262 - What?\\
263 - Charlie's gonna wanna see this.\\
264 - No, he's not.\\
265 - Charlie, wake up.\\
266 - You need to see this.\\
267 - Can I throw up in it?\\
268 - - No. - Then I don't need to see it.\\
269 - Charlie, do you remember what you did last night?\\
270 - Oh, damn it.\\
271 - Did I get married?\\
272 - Hardly.\\
273 - Oh, you just know she's gonna find a way to make this my fault.\\
274 - You climbed out the window?\\
275 - And got into a car driven by a 17-year-old boy.\\
276 - It wasn't a car, Dad. It was an extremely safe monster truck.\\
277 - I mean, even if Rocco hit another car, he'd just crush it.\\
278 - The point is, you disobeyed your father.\\
279 - That doesn't mean I have to get grounded.\\
280 - In my opinion, your punishment isn't severe enough.\\
281 - - Your mother's right. - How come nobody asks my opinion?\\
282 - Go to your room. I will talk to you later.\\
283 - Fine.\\
284 - Hey, thanks for backing me up here, Judith.\\
285 - Now that he's a teenager, we need to stick together to...\\
286 - You don't have a brain in your head, do you?\\
287 - You have to watch teenagers, Alan.\\
288 - You can't just expect they'll listen and obey.\\
289 - God, you're useless.\\
290 - Here. Let me give you a hand.\\
291 - - Really? - Yeah.\\
292 - Now, come with me.\\
293 - - Where are we going? - You're going back to your room.\\
294 - But I am going to the sweet land of vindication.\\
295 - Oh, Judith.\\
296 - Yes?\\
297 - Hey.\\
298 - What are you doing here?\\
299 - I came to apologize.\\
300 - I am sorry about last night.\\
301 - You're sorry for ruining one of the most important nights of my career?\\
302 - For embarrassing me within an inch of my life?\\
303 - Well, yeah.\\
304 - I mean, unless I did something else.\\
305 - No, you did quite enough. Thank you.\\
306 - Look, I understand why you're mad.\\
307 - But it really wasn't my fault.\\
308 - I was nervous about last night, so my mother gave me...\\
309 - ...what I assumed was one of her tranquilizers.\\
310 - Now I'm thinking it was a little something...\\
311 - ...she had left over from Woodstock.\\
312 - Charlie, look, you're a lot of fun and I like you.\\
313 - But people are talking about me running for state senate next year.\\
314 - And I can't afford to be linked publicly to someone like you.\\
315 - Well, that's not a problem.\\
316 - We'll just sneak around and link privately.\\
317 - No, Charlie.\\
318 - Come on, all the guy politicians have something on the side.\\
319 - Why shouldn't you?\\
320 - Take care.\\
321 - It would send a powerful message to young women everywhere.\\
322 - - Bailiff. - I'm going.\\
323 - Pretty flowers.\\
324 - Thanks.\\
325 - Wanna stick them in something?\\
326 - Never mind.\\
327 - I thought I was up to it, Alan.\\
328 - I thought I was ready for a real relationship.\\
329 - That Linda and I would be a team.\\
330 - I'd stand by her as an accomplished woman and a judge...\\
331 - ...and she'd stand by me as a...\\
332 - Reformed whoremonger?\\
333 - - So you believe I was trying? - I do.\\
334 - You know what? Someday, you'll look back on this as a growing experience.\\
335 - Maybe. Someday.\\
336 - Oh, who could that be?\\
337 - - I ordered some takeout. - Oh, nice.\\
338 - - Italian? - Nope.\\
339 - Hi. Are you Charlie?\\
340 - Yeah. Come on in.\\
341 - Greek.\\
342 - Be patient with me.\\
343 - I'm coming off a bad breakup.\\
344 - And as usual, Alan gets chicken pot pie.\\
345 - Resynced by Ubolena.
\subsection {Episode 07: The Leather Gear is in the Guest Room}
1 - - Look, don't worry, you'll grow into it. - Just once, I'd like to get clothes that fit.\\
2 - Well, quit going through puberty and we'll talk about it.\\
3 - Quit being so cheap and we'll talk about it.\\
4 - Hey, hey, watch your mouth.\\
5 - Hard to punish him for telling the truth.\\
6 - Oh, yeah? Wait till he tries on the underwear I bought him.\\
7 - - What's that? - A decorative bowl.\\
8 - I thought it'd be perfect to put our keys in.\\
9 - Yeah, well, I don't like it. Take it back.\\
10 - But it was on sale.\\
11 - I don't care if you got it free with a paid subscription to Ugly Bowl Illustrated.\\
12 - I don't want it on my table.\\
13 - - Why not? - Why not?\\
14 - Look around. It doesn't fit the d cor.\\
15 - D cor? You call this d cor?\\
16 - - What would you call it? - Random crapola.\\
17 - The deep-sea helmet. The fake jazz posters.\\
18 - Add an old snow sled and baseball pennants...\\
19 - ...and you can open a T.G.I. Friday's.\\
20 - Excuse me, but everything in this house has a story behind it.\\
21 - Oh, really? Oh, so, what's the story behind this urn thing?\\
22 - Some girl gave that to me.\\
23 - - That's it? - She spent the weekend.\\
24 - - Great story. - No, great weekend.\\
25 - Okay, okay, what about this umbrella stand that has no umbrellas?\\
26 - A girl gave me that too.\\
27 - - Another great weekend? - Not so great, it was raining.\\
28 - All right, why don't you pretend a girl gave you this bowl?\\
29 - It doesn't work that way.\\
30 - You'd have to wear high heels and give it to me naked, and nobody wants that.\\
31 - Fine, whatever, I like the bowl.\\
32 - Okay, Alan, you're not feeling me. I don't want your bowl on my table.\\
33 - I can't have one stupid thing in this house?\\
34 - Hey, leave Jake out of this.\\
35 - - Very funny. You know what I mean. - Actually, I don't.\\
36 - The fact is, this house reeks of you and your crap.\\
37 - - Oh, really? Like what? - Like this lamp.\\
38 - You bought this lamp. I hate this lamp.\\
39 - Why didn't you say something two years ago?\\
40 - Because I didn't notice it until recently.\\
41 - The couch. You reupholstered the couch and I liked it better the way it was.\\
42 - Stained?\\
43 - Hey, every one of those stains had a story behind it.\\
44 - What I'm saying is you got nothing to complain about.\\
45 - You got your food in my refrigerator, your car in my garage...\\
46 - ...and your stupid flowered towels in my guest bathroom.\\
47 - Those towels are pretty. They brighten up the whole room.\\
48 - They're gay and they scream "civil union."\\
49 - Oh, they do not.\\
50 - "We're here, we're queer, dry your hands on us."\\
51 - Okay, you know what? You are being ridiculous.\\
52 - When you wanna have a rational conversation, I'll be in my room.\\
53 - It's not your room, it's my guest room.\\
54 - Well, obviously we disagree about my role in this household.\\
55 - We sure do. You think you have one, and I don't.\\
56 - And get rid of that welcome mat you put on my front porch.\\
57 - No one's welcome here.\\
58 - Charlie, I'm telling you right now, I am not gonna sleep with you tonight.\\
59 - Where'd that come from? Buy you a couple of drinks, invite you...\\
60 - ...back to my house and all of a sudden you think I wanna sleep with you?\\
61 - Well, you mean you don't?\\
62 - Hey, we just met. Let's talk, get to know each other.\\
63 - If later down the road something happens, great.\\
64 - If not, we've each made a new friend.\\
65 - That is very sweet.\\
66 - Well, my mother raised me...\\
67 - ...to be respectful of women, and I've always said...\\
68 - Son of a bitch.\\
69 - What?\\
70 - That. That's what.\\
71 - Butterscotch candies?\\
72 - In about 30 seconds, they're gonna be butterscotch suppositories.\\
73 - So you noticed it.\\
74 - Maybe I didn't make myself clear.\\
75 - I don't want this stupid bowl in my living room.\\
76 - No, you said you didn't want it on the front table for keys.\\
77 - So I put it on the coffee table for candy.\\
78 - Yeah, well, now it's on your head for a hat.\\
79 - I am sorry, I had to set my brother straight...\\
80 - I don't know why you're making such a big deal. It is a nice bowl.\\
81 - It is a hideous bowl. It makes me nauseous just to look at it.\\
82 - - You're being ridiculous. Isn't this nice? - It's okay.\\
83 - - See? Two against one. - No, no, no. No, there's no voting.\\
84 - You're just a freeloader and she's some one-night stand I picked up at a ba...\\
85 - Damn.\\
86 - - Goodbye, Charlie. - Oh, come on, don't leave.\\
87 - You know what the worst part is? I actually believed the things you said.\\
88 - You're kidding.\\
89 - - Thanks a lot. - What did I do?\\
90 - - You made me blow a sure thing. - Didn't look like a sure thing.\\
91 - I could have brought her around.\\
92 - Why don't we just admit it? This isn't about the bowl, this isn't about the girl.\\
93 - - This is about my place in this house. - No, no, no.\\
94 - It is about the bowl, it is about the girl, and you have no place in this house.\\
95 - - You really believe that? - What do you want from me, Alan?\\
96 - I took you in. I took your kid in.\\
97 - All I ask is you don't fill up my home with your junk.\\
98 - It's not junk. It's an inlaid mosaic dish handcrafted on the island of Macao.\\
99 - Yeah, well...\\
100 - Now it's rubble from the island of Macao.\\
101 - I hope you're happy.\\
102 - Really? I don't think you do.\\
103 - Let me tell you something, Charlie.\\
104 - You said you took me and my kid into your home, but you didn't.\\
105 - You took us into your house. We made it a home.\\
106 - - Is that so? - Yes, that's so.\\
107 - Before we got here this was an empty space where you sat around, got drunk...\\
108 - ...and had sex with women you don't care about.\\
109 - There was no love, no family, and no meaning.\\
110 - There's a word for that, Alan. Utopia.\\
111 - - I heard something break. - You're just coming out now?\\
112 - I was establishing my alibi.\\
113 - - Well, go pack your stuff, we're leaving. - But I have an alibi.\\
114 - You're my son. Where I go, you go.\\
115 - I don't remember that in the custody agreement.\\
116 - Okay, we're leaving.\\
117 - - Say goodbye to your Uncle Charlie. - Bye, Uncle Charlie.\\
118 - - You don't have to go, Jake. - See?\\
119 - - Get in the car. - But he likes me.\\
120 - I'm not bluffing, Charlie.\\
121 - If you're not willing to acknowledge me as an equal member of this household...\\
122 - ...then I can't live here anymore.\\
123 - Is that all it will take to get you to stay?\\
124 - Yes.\\
125 - Bye-bye.\\
126 - So this is about a bowl?\\
127 - - No, the bowl is a symbol. - Of what?\\
128 - - Of how your Uncle Charlie treats us. - He treats me fine.\\
129 - - No, he doesn't. - Yeah, he does.\\
130 - I don't wanna talk about this.\\
131 - How come when I don't wanna talk about stuff we still have to?\\
132 - Just be quiet.\\
133 - So are we going to a hotel?\\
134 - We don't need hotels, buddy.\\
135 - We're two single guys on the open road. Footloose and fancy-free.\\
136 - The whole world is at our feet.\\
137 - If you're too cheap for a hotel, I call the back seat.\\
138 - Hello?\\
139 - Hi, Mom.\\
140 - Hi, Grandma.\\
141 - It's late. What do you want?\\
142 - Charlie and I had a fight. Jake and I need a place to sleep.\\
143 - Only because he's too cheap to get a... We need a place to sleep.\\
144 - We have nowhere else to go.\\
145 - Oh, wonderful. Be right there.\\
146 - Are you sure we can't sleep in the car?\\
147 - Then he said that I had no place in his house.\\
148 - - Can you believe it? My own brother. - He likes me.\\
149 - Hey, when I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.\\
150 - Then I said, if he's not willing to acknowledge me...\\
151 - ...as an equal member of the household then I can't live there anymore.\\
152 - So this is about a bowl?\\
153 - - No, haven't you been listening? - Frankly, no.\\
154 - Don't feel bad. I thought it was about a bowl too.\\
155 - So look, Alan, I just got back from a long business trip...\\
156 - ...and your mom and I were about to...\\
157 - Catch up.\\
158 - Would you like to sleep in your father's car tonight?\\
159 - Actually, yes.\\
160 - Look, look, we're sorry for barging in.\\
161 - Jake and I will just bunk in the guest room. Come on.\\
162 - You know, I'm really getting tired of this "where I go, you go" stuff.\\
163 - Oh, great, now we have to put on clothes for breakfast.\\
164 - That's the least of our problems.\\
165 - All our leather gear is in the guest room.\\
166 - - Morning. - Morning.\\
167 - I couldn't help but notice the guys from Goodwill hauling away Alan's hide-a-bed.\\
168 - Oh, yeah. He doesn't live here anymore.\\
169 - - No kidding. Alan's gone? - Yep.\\
170 - So you couldn't think for even a second that I might want a hide-a-bed?\\
171 - Sorry. You want some flowered towels?\\
172 - Pass.\\
173 - - So, what broke you two lovebirds up? - He crossed a line.\\
174 - - Must've been a big one. - Very big.\\
175 - - Was it money? - Worse.\\
176 - - A woman? - Worse.\\
177 - What's worse than money and women?\\
178 - He bought an ugly bowl and put it on the front table.\\
179 - No.\\
180 - When I told him to get rid of it, he filled it with candy and put it on the coffee table.\\
181 - Dear God.\\
182 - - What kind of candy? - Butterscotch.\\
183 - I mean, the son of bitch.\\
184 - - Are you making fun of me? - I'm trying.\\
185 - So what, you think I should just let him put a candy dish wherever he wants?\\
186 - No, you're right. He obviously had to go.\\
187 - He's an ungrateful parasite who overstepped his boundaries.\\
188 - - Exactly. - While you on the other hand...\\
189 - ...are a completely reasonable man with no control issues whatsoever.\\
190 - - I don't pay you to mock me. - Charlie, you'd have to pay me not to.\\
191 - Fruit. That's all you got, fruit?\\
192 - Don't you ever have fruit for breakfast?\\
193 - Well, yeah, Frankenberries.\\
194 - Oh, well, I'm sorry, sweetheart.\\
195 - If I had known you were coming, I would've stocked up on crap.\\
196 - Well, maybe we can go crap shopping later.\\
197 - So, what's the plan?\\
198 - You gonna patch things up with your brother...\\
199 - ...and go home?\\
200 - Not until he apologizes.\\
201 - - Oh, sweet Lord. - Oh, jeez.\\
202 - Don't worry, I'll find my own place. We'll only be here a few days, tops.\\
203 - Yeah, right. That's what you told Uncle Charlie when we moved there.\\
204 - If you remember, when Judith and I broke up, you were begging me to live here.\\
205 - Yes, well, I didn't have a boyfriend then and Jake was still cute.\\
206 - Alan, can we have a little man-to-man?\\
207 - Sure.\\
208 - I'm just going through an awkward stage.\\
209 - You hope.\\
210 - Al, I know how you feel. I had an older brother too.\\
211 - - Really? - Yep.\\
212 - Scotty. I worshiped him.\\
213 - But ever since I can remember...\\
214 - ...he did everything he could to make my life miserable.\\
215 - - That's my life with Charlie. - No kidding.\\
216 - Well, then, maybe my experience can help you.\\
217 - When my parents died, Scotty took me in. It was just the two of us.\\
218 - Then one day I got so angry with the way he was treating me, I walked out.\\
219 - I haven't seen him or talked to him in... I don't know, maybe 35 years.\\
220 - Yeah. I don't know where he lives. I don't know whether he's alive or dead.\\
221 - All I do know is he's the only family I have left in the world.\\
222 - And despite all the bad stuff, I want him back in my life.\\
223 - But it's too late for me.\\
224 - I'm not going back to Charlie's unless he apologizes.\\
225 - Yep, that's what I said about my brother Artie.\\
226 - I thought his name was Scotty.\\
227 - I had two brothers.\\
228 - What are you doing?\\
229 - Just looking.\\
230 - You miss him, don't you?\\
231 - No, I'm trying to figure out if there's room for a pool table.\\
232 - - Oh, hey, Teddy. - Charlie, you got a minute?\\
233 - - Sure, I guess. Come on in. - Thanks.\\
234 - Hey, what about air hockey and a wet bar?\\
235 - Hello.\\
236 - - How are you? - Better now.\\
237 - Charlie?\\
238 - - What? - Introduce us, you porkhead.\\
239 - Oh, sorry. Berta, this is my mom's boyfriend Teddy.\\
240 - - Teddy, my housekeeper Berta. - A pleasure.\\
241 - It could be if you play your cards right.\\
242 - You'll be fine. Just don't wander into the laundry room without backup.\\
243 - Fine. Listen, I got a situation here with your brother.\\
244 - I'm sorry, Teddy. He cannot come back until he apologizes.\\
245 - - I understand, but the thing is... - Did he tell you about the bowl?\\
246 - Repeatedly.\\
247 - And I know what you're going through. I had a younger brother too.\\
248 - - Really? - Yeah, Scotty.\\
249 - A worthless sponge who lived off me for years...\\
250 - ...and never showed any appreciation.\\

176 - I'm not doing any concerts.\\
177 - - Why not? - Because I'm not. Case closed.\\

181 - The gold's gonna keep coming, even if I have to get it myself.\\
182 - Potty Potty\\
183 - So?\\
184 - Waffle for your thoughts?\\
185 - - Leave me alone. - I don't understand.\\
186 - I would think a sold-out concert would be good news for Charlie Waffles.\\
187 - - Yeah, well, it's not. - Because?\\
188 - You ever wonder why I never played in a band?\\
189 - I just figured you were getting laid so much...\\
190 - ...being in a rock band would seem redundant.\\
191 - That's not the reason.\\
192 - Although I did do better than most bass players.\\
193 - Okay, then what is the reason?\\
194 - - I have stage fright. - You have stage fright?\\
195 - Severe, debilitating, wet-your-pants stage fright.\\
196 - I don't understand.\\
197 - I've seen you perform.\\
198 - Well, sure, in the living room for a couple of people.\\
199 - But on a stage with lights, in front of a crowd paying to see me...\\
200 - Do you literally pee your pants?\\
201 - What difference does it make?\\
202 - I'm just saying your audience is composed of bed wetters.\\
203 - They might get a kick out of seeing you soil yourself.\\
204 - - And you think that'd be funny? - No, I wouldn't.\\
205 - But I'm not your audience.\\
206 - Hello?\\
207 - I don't know what to tell you, Artie. I can't do it.\\
208 - - I don't need a reason why. - Just tell him the truth.\\
209 - It's show business, Alan, you don't tell people the truth.\\
210 - Look, I'll make the CDs, I'll shoot the commercials...\\
211 - ...I'll even do the bookstores. Just no concerts.\\
212 - Hey, I don't have to do anything.\\
213 - Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do, sue me?\\
214 - Really?\\
215 - - Can he sue me? - Did you sign a contract?\\
216 - What time is the concert?\\
217 - Okay, see you Saturday night.\\

227 - You wake up in the morning And it's quarter to 2\\
228 - You want to find something to do You brush your teeth\\
229 - Oh, Raffi, you magnificent son of a bitch.\\
230 - How do you do it? How does he do it, Alan?\\
231 - What's he got that I don't?\\
232 - Well, based on first impressions...\\
233 - ...I'd say, a genuine love of children, and bladder control.\\
234 - - Well, that was just a cheap shot. - I take them when I get them.\\
235 - Look at him. All relaxed and smiling.\\
236 - Last time I was in front of an audience like that...\\
237 - ...seventh-grade talent show...\\
238 - ...I started shaking, sweating, felt like I wanted to throw up.\\
239 - Don't forget peeing in your pants.\\
240 - You keep pitching me fat ones.\\
241 - - I'm not talking to you anymore. - Oh, come on.\\
242 - Look, if you knew in the seventh grade that you couldn't perform...\\
243 - ...why'd you become a musician?\\
244 - Because there's one thing I am more afraid of than an audience.\\
245 - What's that? An honest day's work?\\
246 - If you knew the answer, why'd you ask the question?\\
247 - Charlie Waffles. Charlie Waffles.\\
248 - Where the hell is he, Alan?\\
249 - I don't know. He said he wanted to take a walk to calm himself down.\\
250 - I promise you, I will crucify that son of a bitch.\\
251 - The two of you will be in a box over a heating vent...\\
252 - ...when I get through suing him.\\
253 - Could it be a box with a guest room?\\
254 - Hey, Alan.\\
255 - I figured out what went wrong in seventh grade.\\
256 - What?\\
257 - I hadn't started drinking yet.\\
258 - - Charlie, you have to get out there. - Right.\\
259 - The little bastards await.\\
260 - You can't sue him if he just stinks, right?\\
261 - Who loves kids?\\
262 - Charlie Waffles.\\

18 - Well, if I eat enough shrimp, I can make myself puke.\\
19 - Then start eating.\\
20 - Okay, stop it, both of you. There will be no puking.\\
21 - We're gonna stay, congratulate the happy couple...\\
22 - ...mingle a bit, and then I'm gonna fake a migraine.\\

24 - I spent 12 years watching my wife fake migraines and orgasms.\\
25 - I'd go with the migraine.\\

37 - So, Teddy, what's the deal?\\
38 - All this time, you've been hiding this beautiful woman from us?\\
39 - Just from you, Charlie.\\
40 - - Fair enough. - Dad's a little overprotective.\\
41 - I can see why.\\
42 - Charlie, why don't you and I get Courtney a drink?\\
43 - I'd like to get Courtney a house.\\
44 - Walk with me.\\
45 - - How's your headache, Dad? - Not yet. So...\\

53 - - I appreciate that. - Consider it a wedding present.\\
54 - - Thanks. - No, seriously, that's all you get.\\
55 - Courtney, dear, what a surprise to see you.\\
56 - - Well, I told you I was coming. - Yes, but the party started an hour ago.\\
57 - So I naturally assumed that something had come up that was more important...\\
58 - ...than your father's happiness.\\
59 - Well, Evelyn, you know what they say about assuming.\\
60 - When you assume, you're just a bitch.\\
61 - - Courtney, there are children present. - She means me, but I'm fine with it.\\
62 - Thank you, dear.\\
63 - You should hear what they call her at home.\\
64 - - Have some shrimp. - Oh, boy.\\
65 - - Well, great party, but we gotta go. - Oh, already?\\

68 - Not yet debilitating, but I do need to lay down.\\
69 - Hey, before you go, my dad had mentioned that you like nice cars.\\
70 - - Yeah. - I do too.\\
71 - Swell.\\

73 - Whoa, Ferraris, Lamborghinis.\\
74 - They say driving one is the most fun you can have with your pants on.\\
75 - Well, that's how I like to drive. With my pants on.\\
76 - Otherwise, the leather kind of sticks to my thighs.\\
77 - Well, you should come down sometime. I'll give you a test drive.\\
78 - - Actually, I'm really not a Ferrari guy. - I'm not either.\\
79 - - Bye. - Bye-bye.\\
80 - We really gotta get our signals straight. I mean, you made me look stupid.\\

90 - So, what did you do?\\
91 - Menstrual cramps.\\
92 - Yeah, I can't get away with that.\\
93 - Although sometimes I'll use irritable bowel syndrome.\\
94 - And...\\
95 - Okay, I'll get Charlie.\\
96 - It's Teddy's daughter. She wants to talk to you.\\
97 - - Really? - You promised Teddy you'd stay away.\\
98 - Hey, I didn't tell her to call me.\\
99 - What kind of man would hit on his future stepsister?\\
100 - You're just making it hotter for him.\\
101 - Give me the phone, give me the phone.\\
102 - Hi, Courtney, what's up?\\
103 - That's nice, but I told you, I'm really not into Ferraris.\\
104 - A Bentley? Oh, it's a little more my style.\\
105 - Okay, I guess I could come by and take a peek at it.\\
106 - First a peek, then a poke.\\
107 - Uncalled for.\\
108 - Two o'clock? Great. I'll see you then.\\
109 - I swear this is just business.\\
110 - I'm going to look at a Bentley she got in on trade.\\
111 - I can get it for dealer cost.\\
112 - - Since when do you need a Bentley? - Nobody needs a Bentley, Alan.\\
113 - Just like nobody needs to date a woman half their age.\\
114 - But if you want one, it doesn't hurt to have the other.\\
115 - Did Teddy tell you to stay away from his daughter too?\\
116 - - No. - Yeah, why would he?\\
117 - Pretty hot, isn't it?\\
118 - Oh, yeah. But it's not really my thing.\\
119 - Gee, I think a guy like you would look great in one of these.\\
120 - - You think? - Absolutely.\\
121 - Here. Slide on into it. See how it feels.\\
122 - What about the Bentley?\\
123 - I got the guys in the back washing it up for you. We have a few minutes.\\
124 - Sure, why not.\\
125 - That's always been my motto.\\
126 - Oh, pretty snug.\\
127 - Tight's good, don't you think?\\
128 - Sure, tight's good.\\
129 - Oh, hi.\\
130 - Hi.\\
131 - So where do they put the engine in these things?\\
132 - They put it where it belongs. In the rear.\\
133 - - So no stick? - No, you shift from the wheel.\\
134 - Let me show you.\\
135 - Left side down, right side up.\\
136 - You don't need a stick.\\
137 - And yet I've got one anyway.\\
138 - - Is that your cell phone? - Boy, I hope so.\\
139 - Excuse me.\\
140 - Hello?\\
141 - Oh, hey, hey, hey. Teddy, how are you?\\
142 - Good. Me? I'm fine.\\
143 - Just running some errands.\\
144 - Yeah, I'll be around tomorrow. Drop by anytime.\\
145 - Great. I'll see you then.\\
146 - That was your dad.\\
147 - He wants to talk to me and Alan about something.\\
148 - I heard.\\
149 - - Has he ever said anything about me? - You? Let me think.\\
150 - He told you to stay away from me, didn't he?\\
151 - Oh, yeah, there was that.\\
152 - I can't believe he's still trying to control my life.\\
153 - Hey, your dad loves you.\\
154 - He's just trying to protect you from, well, in this case, me.\\
155 - I'm a big girl, Charlie, I can take care of myself.\\
156 - I'm sure you can.\\
157 - I can also take care of whoever I choose to be with.\\
158 - I'm sure you can.\\
159 - Listen, I appreciate the offer, but I think I'm gonna pass.\\
160 - On the Bentley.\\
161 - But you haven't even seen it yet.\\
162 - And right now, it's all wet and soapy, just waiting for you.\\
163 - Are we still talking about a car?\\
164 - What do you think?\\
165 - I think I should probably get out before I set off the air bag.\\
166 - And then she leaned over real close to play with the... paddles.\\
167 - The what?\\
168 - The paddle shifters on the steering wheel.\\
169 - I had another picture entirely.\\
170 - But I restrained myself.\\
171 - I walked away, and now I can still look Teddy in the eye.\\
172 - That's great.\\
173 - But how come you have no problem looking me in the eye...\\
174 - ...after sleeping with my wife's sister, my son's teacher, my divorce lawyer...\\
175 - ...and my old receptionist?\\
176 - I like Teddy.\\
177 - - And the receptionist was your fault. - How?\\
178 - If you'd paid her a decent salary, she wouldn't have had to hook.\\
179 - I brought the Bentley.\\
180 - Come on, Courtney. I told you I can't.\\
181 - Just one little test drive. What do you have to lose?\\
182 - Well, there's my integrity, my self respect, my relationship with your father...\\
183 - Give me the damn keys.\\
184 - Is your brother still in bed with his sister?\\
185 - Stepsister.\\
186 - To-be.\\
187 - And yes.\\
188 - Wow, how long has it been?\\
189 - About 18 hours.\\
190 - Good thing he's got supplies up there.\\
191 - - He does? - Sure.\\
192 - Water, power bars, fresh batteries, rope.\\
193 - Oh, like an earthquake kit.\\
194 - I guess you could use that stuff for earthquakes.\\
195 - Oh, crap.\\
196 - Misdirected anger. You'll get used to it.\\
197 - - What are you guys doing here? - We came to talk with you and Charlie.\\
198 - Didn't he tell you?\\
199 - He never tells me anything. I don't know half of what he does nor do I want to.\\
200 - It's his life and he alone should suffer the consequences. Come on in.\\
201 - - Is he even home? - I'll check.\\
202 - Why don't you make yourselves comfortable...\\
203 - ...and I'll check.\\
204 - Because I have no idea.\\
205 - So I'll need to check.\\
206 - Is he on something?\\
207 - If only.\\
208 - What?\\
209 - Teddy and Mom are downstairs.\\
210 - - What the hell are they doing here? - Apparently, you invited them.\\
211 - - I did not. - Yes, you did.\\
212 - On the phone, remember? Hey, Alan.\\
213 - Hi, Courtney, how are you doing? Charlie, they're waiting.\\
214 - Yeah, we got a problem here.\\
215 - No, sir, you've got a problem. I made no promise, I broke no promise.\\
216 - - You actually made a promise? - Yeah.\\
217 - - And I really tried to keep it. - He did.\\
218 - I could sense his inner conflict as we did it in the back seat of the Bentley.\\
219 - Look, just stall them. I'll be right down.\\
220 - Fine. But know this, I am not taking the fall for you.\\
221 - - How could you take the fall for me? - I don't know.\\
222 - But it always seems to work out that when you get laid, I get screwed.\\
223 - Just go.\\
224 - - Great. Just great. - Hey, have you seen my dress?\\
225 - - Why? - I ain't going down like this.\\
226 - You're not going down at all.\\
227 - Why not? I have nothing to be ashamed of.\\
228 - Here, hit rewind. I'm sure you'll find something.\\
229 - I just can't believe he's still in bed.\\
230 - He's a drunk, Mom. That's what they do.\\
231 - Oh, come on, Evelyn, give the kid a break.\\
232 - He was probably out late last night sowing wild oats.\\
233 - He's 40 years old, he has no more wild oats.\\
234 - Just warmed-over cream of wheat.\\
235 - Hey, hey, look who's here.\\
236 - Well, thanks for interrupting your stupor and joining us.\\
237 - I can get back to my stupor anytime. So, what's going on?\\
238 - Your mother and I wanted to talk about the wedding.\\
239 - You've got my blessing. What else?\\
240 - Well, we wondered if you would mind having the ceremony here.\\
241 - Sure. Terrific.\\
242 - On the deck, in here, on the beach, wherever you want. What else?\\
243 - Don't you wanna think about it?\\
244 - What's to think about? It's perfect. Have the ceremony, the reception.\\
245 - Alan and I'll clear out. You can use this place for your honeymoon. It's broken in.\\
246 - The house, not Mom.\\
247 - Do you have one of your little pop tarts up there?\\
248 - No, no, just my alarm. If I'm not up by 4 in the afternoon...\\
249 - ...I feel like I've wasted the whole day. Be right back.\\
250 - - What do you think you're doing? - I'm bored.\\
251 - - You're bored? - Yeah. I wanna go downstairs.\\
252 - No, no, no, you can't go downstairs. Find something else to do.\\
253 - Well, I'd love to sell you a car.\\
254 - Yeah, very funny.\\
255 - No, I'm serious.\\
256 - You wanna sell me a car now?\\
257 - Or I could go downstairs.\\
258 - You wouldn't.\\
259 - I would.\\
260 - Wait a minute.\\
261 - You planned this. You knew they were coming over today.\\
262 - Well, a good salesman pays attention.\\
263 - - Now, if you'll excuse me. - Okay, okay, okay, you win.\\
264 - - Give me a price on the Bentley. - The Bentley's no longer available.\\
265 - I'm thinking the Ferrari.\\
266 - - I don't want a Ferrari. - And I don't want to stay up here.\\
267 - - Charlie, we're waiting. - Coming.\\
268 - Okay, fine.\\
269 - But let me just say, this is no way to treat family.\\
270 - Here we go, blue eyes.\\
271 - - I made it myself. - Oh, thank you.\\
272 - - Nothing for me, thanks. - I don't recall offering.\\
273 - Sorry, sorry.\\
274 - So, wedding on the beach. Great. I'll take care of everything.\\
275 - - Thanks for stopping by. - Well, there is one more thing.\\
276 - - Name it. - Well...\\
277 - Excuse me. Berta, this is a family matter.\\
278 - If you only knew.\\
279 - Here's the deal.\\
280 - I never had any sons of my own, just the one daughter.\\
281 - - And she's great. Isn't she great, Alan? - Well, I hardly met her.\\
282 - - Me neither. I'm sure she's great. - She's terrific.\\
283 - But I've grown very fond of the two of you.\\
284 - And I'd like to ask you to stand up with me when I marry your mother.\\
285 - - Teddy, that's quite an honor. - Yeah. I'm really touched.\\
286 - Snooze button. I must have hit the snooze button.\\
287 - Excuse me.\\
288 - I don't use the snooze button. When I'm up, I'm up.\\
289 - Of course, I'm not a drunk.\\
290 - Are you out of your mind?\\
291 - I prefer to think of myself as a go-getter. All right, now you're gonna wanna...\\
292 - ...sign here, here, here, and initial where the little flags are.\\
293 - This is twice as much as the Bentley. I can't afford this.\\
294 - Well, if you need help with the down payment...\\
295 - ...I'm sure I could ask my dad to help you out. He really loves you.\\
296 - Fine.\\
297 - Here. And here. And here.\\
298 - And here. And here.\\
299 - - What's this? - Oh, that's the extended warranty.\\
300 - Just a little extra protection.\\
301 - I think it's a bit late for that.\\
302 - Congratulations. You now own a Ferrari.\\
303 - Yippee.\\
304 - Charlie.\\
305 - What now?\\
306 - I'm gonna need a check.\\
307 - You know, this is the most I have ever spent for sex.\\
308 - But not by much.\\
309 - Okay, Mom, I guess I'll see you at the wedding.\\
310 - Charlie, the wedding isn't for six months.\\
311 - Yeah, but it's bad luck to see the bride beforehand.\\
312 - Thanks again, fellas. You being a part of this shindig means a lot to me.\\
313 - Our pleasure, Teddy. Bye-bye.\\
314 - Congratulations. Once again, you get off scot-free.\\
315 - Free? You think that was free?\\
316 - - Charlie. - Yeah, hey, hi.\\
317 - I wanted you to know I'm not gonna say anything...\\
318 - ...about you and Courtney. They don't get along.\\
319 - Okay, great. Wait, wait, wait.\\
320 - You knew? How did you know?\\
321 - I just noticed the car outside with her dealer plates on it.\\
322 - You couldn't have noticed that on the way in?\\
323 - - How much did she take you for? - Don't ask.\\
324 - - Well, you can't say I didn't warn you. - Wait, wait, wait.\\
325 - So you were trying to protect me?\\
326 - Hey, you're a good kid.\\
327 - And Courtney, well, I love her, but she is kind of a sociopath.\\
328 - Bye now.\\
329 - - You know what this means, don't you? - What?\\
330 - I'm gonna need an eight-car garage.\\
331 - Resynced by Ubolena.
\subsection {Episode 10: Kinda Like Necrophilia}
1 - Oh, yeah. I am a finely tuned machine.\\
2 - - Hello. - Are you a friend of Charlie's?\\
3 - I'm his brother.\\
4 - So, no.\\
5 - - I'm Gabrielle. - Nice to meet you.\\
6 - I'm Alan.\\
7 - Or, as you would say, "Alan."\\
8 - Why would I say that?\\
9 - No reason. I'm a little dehydrated.\\
10 - - So you are a cyclist. - A what?\\
11 - A cyclist? You know, with your bicycle.\\
12 - Yes, yes. I'm very passionate about...\\
13 - ..."bicycling."\\
14 - I even have a stationary "cycle."\\
15 - I also jog and ab-crunch...\\
16 - ...and, of course, les buns of steel.\\
17 - - Nice, huh? - Nice? She's magnificent.\\
18 - - You should see her naked. - Can I?\\
19 - Well, I could show you some pictures...\\
20 - ...but you may not wanna see that much of me.\\
21 - Just out of curiosity, where do you find women like that?\\
22 - And, more importantly, how do you get them to go to bed with you?\\
23 - - You really wanna know? - Yeah. What's your secret?\\
24 - Well, you see, Alan, it's like this:\\
25 - I got a knack.\\
26 - - That's not a secret. - Well, I didn't think so, but you asked.\\
27 - - So that's it? You've got a knack? - Hey, everybody's good at something.\\
28 - You, for instance...\\
29 - ...have no shame.\\
30 - Excuse me, this is what they wear in the Tour de France.\\
31 - Alan, I just took a Tour de France.\\
32 - And the only thing I was wearing was a smile and a condom.\\
33 - - Hi, Judith. Hey, buddy. - Hey.\\
34 - What's the matter with him?\\
35 - - His little girlfriend broke up with him. - Oh, no.\\
36 - Yeah. I was hoping you could talk to him, because, let's face it...\\
37 - ...who knows more about getting dumped?\\
38 - - Don't flatter me, Judith. I'll talk to him. - I'm sorry.\\
39 - - That didn't come out the way I meant it. - Really? How did you mean it?\\
40 - Couldn't you just take the "I'm sorry"?\\
41 - Couldn't you have just loved me?\\
42 - - Did I hear Numbnuts come in? - Numbnuts?\\
43 - Sorry. Numbnuts Jr.\\
44 - - Lf you mean my son, yes, he's here. - Crap.\\
45 - - What are you doing? - Hiding my cookies.\\
46 - - Why? - Because I just bought a new bag...\\
47 - ...and I don't want that knucklehead to eat them all.\\
48 - Oh, Charlie. You hide your cookies from a little boy who loves you?\\
49 - "Little boy," my ass. He's a bottomless pit.\\
50 - And I'm tired of going for a snack and having to lick cookie dust out of the bag.\\
51 - You might wanna take it easy on him.\\
52 - - He's going through a breakup. - Really?\\
53 - Yeah.\\
54 - Nope. My cookies.\\
55 - - So how was school this week? - Okay.\\
56 - - Anything noteworthy happen? - No.\\
57 - Thought you said he got dumped.\\
58 - - I was easing into it. - Oh, good idea. Go ahead.\\
59 - Jake, sooner or later, every guy gets dumped.\\
60 - Some guys get dumped sooner and later, right, Alan?\\
61 - Sorry. I should've eased into that.\\
62 - My point is, you've got nothing to be embarrassed about.\\
63 - I'm not embarrassed. I'm angry. She didn't even tell me why.\\
64 - She just sent me an e-mail saying she doesn't wanna go out with me anymore.\\
65 - Maybe she found somebody better.\\
66 - What do you mean, better? Who's better than Jake?\\
67 - Why, no one, Alan.\\
68 - He's the pinnacle of male evolution.\\
69 - Thank you.\\
70 - Look, buddy, I know exactly how you feel.\\
71 - When I was your age, I was dating a beautiful girl:\\
72 - Charity Kirschenbaum. I was crazy about her.\\
73 - Then, the night before junior prom, she called and dumped me.\\
74 - Wouldn't even give me a reason. I was devastated.\\
75 - - So, what'd you do? - What could I do?\\
76 - How can you mend a broken heart?\\
77 - How can you stop the rain From falling down?\\
78 - - You done? - Unless you wanna hear "Jive Talkin'."\\
79 - The thing is, Jake...\\
80 - ...that no matter how bad you feel now, eventually, it'll pass.\\
81 - You just have to be willing to live with the pain.\\
82 - - No, he doesn't. - Yes, he does.\\
83 - Hang on, Dad. What do you mean, no, I don't?\\
84 - When you get dumped, don't sit around feeling sorry for yourself.\\
85 - You go out and find another girl, a better girl.\\
86 - Okay, but how am I gonna get another girl?\\
87 - I don't know how I got this one.\\
88 - You don't know how you got a girlfriend?\\
89 - No, it just kind of happened.\\
90 - Yeah, I know how that goes.\\
91 - Wake up in the morning, and there she is. Shut up. I know that was wrong.\\
92 - Look, Jake, who is the cutest girl in your class?\\
93 - - Nicole O'Malley. - Okay, call Nicole O'Malley...\\
94 - ...and ask her out. - You drunk?\\
95 - A little.\\
96 - But this is a secret that will serve you for the rest of your life:\\
97 - The hotter the girl, the Ionelier she is...\\
98 - ...because most guys are too scared to talk to her.\\
99 - - Really? - Really?\\
100 - Trust me.\\
101 - Why couldn't you have said this 20 years ago?\\
102 - Come on, Dad. I wasn't even born 20 years ago.\\
103 - I really shouldn't be giving him advice that could help him reproduce, should I?\\
104 - Oh, it's just you.\\
105 - Hey.\\
106 - What are you doing?\\
107 - I am drinking some of your finest Scotch and looking at my high-school yearbook.\\
108 - Charity Kirschenbaum.\\
109 - I can't help wondering how my life would've turned out...\\
110 - ...if she hadn't dumped me.\\
111 - Come on, your life turned out great.\\
112 - Well, it wouldn't have turned out any better.\\
113 - You know what?\\
114 - I'm gonna call her and find out why she broke my heart.\\
115 - Good thinking.\\
116 - Call your high-school girlfriend drunk at 2 in the morning.\\
117 - While you're at it, why don't you expose yourself to an undercover policewoman?\\
118 - Some people do that.\\
119 - I need closure. I need to understand why she dumped me.\\
120 - What's to understand?\\
121 - This is her.\\
122 - This is you.\\
123 - Peaches-and-cream complexion.\\
124 - You.\\
125 - Cheerleader.\\
126 - You.\\
127 - Stop me any time.\\
128 - I don't care. I got her number off the Internet, and I'm calling her.\\
129 - Oh, man.\\
130 - When are they gonna invent a phone with a Breathalyzer lock?\\
131 - It's ringing.\\
132 - Hello?\\
133 - Hello? Is this Charity?\\
134 - Hi, Charity. This is Alan Harper.\\
135 - Yeah, yeah, from high school.\\
136 - Anyway...\\
137 - Yeah, I know it's late.\\
138 - Yeah, I know I'm drunk.\\
139 - Listen, I just need to ask you one question.\\
140 - Why did you dump me on the night before junior prom?\\
141 - Okay. Okay.\\
142 - Okay, thanks. Go back to sleep.\\
143 - She said, to ask my brother, Cha...\\
144 - - rlie.\\
145 - Oh, that's why.\\
146 - Morning.\\
147 - Morning.\\
148 - You found the stash, huh?\\
149 - Wasn't well-hidden.\\
150 - Okay, just for the record, that stuff's medicinal.\\
151 - I've got glaucoma.\\
152 - - What are you talking about? - Nothing.\\
153 - - Morning. - Morning.\\
154 - - So where'd you disappear to last night? - Me?\\
155 - I decided to take a little drive...\\
156 - ...give you a chance to calm down about Charity Kirschenbaum.\\
157 - - I'm perfectly calm. - Good.\\
158 - Who's Charity Kirschenbaum?\\
159 - It's just a little thing that's not worth getting upset about, and...\\
160 - Hey, what the hell are you doing with my cookies?\\
161 - - They're yours? - You know they're mine.\\
162 - Oh, so you're saying I took something that belonged to you, and you're upset?\\
163 - Oh, come on, Alan.\\
164 - I loved Charity Kirschenbaum, and you stole her right out from under me.\\
165 - He's speaking metaphorically, right?\\
166 - Yeah. He was never on top of that.\\
167 - - I would've been, if it weren't for you. - Okay, fine. I took your girl 20 years ago.\\
168 - That calls for maybe five, six cookies, tops, not the whole damn bag.\\
169 - I had to go to junior prom with cousin Phoebe.\\
170 - - She was cute. - She was 12 and in a body cast.\\
171 - Well, so what? She was your cousin.\\
172 - She could've been 18 and in a cellophane bikini...\\
173 - ...and you weren't gonna get any.\\
174 - You are a horrible human being, and I hope you burn in hell.\\
175 - - So we're good? - No! We're not good!\\
176 - We suck!\\
177 - - Freshen that up for you? - Thanks.\\
178 - You betrayed me!\\
179 - I hate you!\\
180 - I hate you! I hate you!\\
181 - I hate you!\\
182 - Sounds like he's going for a bike ride.\\
183 - Hello? Nicole O'Malley?\\
184 - Jake Harper here.\\
185 - Harper. I sit next to you in geometry class.\\
186 - No, the other side.\\
187 - Yeah, with the big head.\\
188 - I was wondering if you would go to the winter dance with me.\\
189 - Really? Are you sure?\\
190 - Well, great. I guess I'll see you at school. Bye.\\
191 - - Uncle Charlie's a genius. - In a sense.\\
192 - But there's book smart and "look smart."\\
193 - - Would you get that, Berta? - What?\\
194 - - The door. - I can't hear you.\\
195 - - I said, would you get the door? - I can't. I'm upstairs.\\
196 - Hi, Judith. Jake, your mom's here.\\
197 - - Did you talk to him? - I did.\\
198 - - Hey, Mom. - Hey, honey. How's it going?\\
199 - - Great. Uncle Charlie's a genius. - Good, good.\\
200 - - You said you talked to him. - I did.\\
201 - - Then why is Uncle Charlie a genius? - Because he never got married.\\
202 - Oh, that's gonna come back to bite me in the ass.\\
203 - And here it comes, jaws a-snapping.\\
204 - All right, I'm sorry.\\
205 - Why are you sorry?\\
206 - I just find it's easier that way.\\
207 - Okay. Is Charlie at home?\\
208 - Oh, no. He went out a couple of hours ago.\\
209 - I've been trying to call him on his cell, but he doesn't answer.\\
210 - - Well, please tell him I stopped by. - Sure thing.\\
211 - Gabrielle?\\
212 - Forgive me if I'm out of line...\\
213 - ...but I sense a Ioneliness inside you.\\
214 - - Is it so obvious? - I'm right?\\
215 - Oh, yes. But how could you know?\\
216 - We're two of a kind.\\
217 - I myself have tasted the saltiness of Ionely tears.\\
218 - - We have much to share. - We do indeed. Come on in.\\
219 - First his cookies, now his croissant.\\
220 - Well, in my experience, I've found that the more beautiful the woman is...\\
221 - ...the Ionelier she is.\\
222 - That's very true. How do you know so much about women?\\
223 - What can I say? I have a knack.\\
224 - - Hey. - Oh, hello, Charlie.\\
225 - Gee, how embarrassing.\\
226 - - What are you talking about? - Oh, dear. This is so difficult.\\
227 - No, it's not. Go ahead, tell him. Tell him.\\
228 - Charlie, you're a wonderful man, but your brother, he really understands me.\\
229 - So, what are you saying?\\
230 - It's just...\\
231 - l...\\
232 - - I can't. - I can. She's dumping you for me.\\
233 - This is so awkward. I must go.\\
234 - Please forgive me?\\
235 - How does it feel?\\
236 - - I'm stunned. - Good, good. What else?\\
237 - - You snaked my girlfriend? - Yes, I did.\\
238 - I snaked her. Like a cobra.\\
239 - - And you did it just to hurt me? - Well, not just to hurt you.\\
240 - Well, yeah, just to hurt you.\\
241 - I don't know what to say.\\
242 - - I'm crushed. - That's good. Say that. "I'm crushed."\\
243 - My own brother purposefully set out to hurt me.\\
244 - Oh, no. Oh, no. You're not taking this away from me.\\
245 - What about you and Charity Kirschenbaum?\\
246 - I was 17, Alan. I was a horny idiot. But you, you're an adult.\\
247 - Okay. I see where you're going, and it's not gonna work.\\
248 - You're not taking this away from me.\\
249 - I really thought our relationship had grown beyond this petty crap.\\
250 - I thought I could count on you.\\
251 - I thought you were my friend.\\
252 - Son of a bitch. He took it away from me.\\
253 - Oh, hey. You're here.\\
254 - Where am I gonna go, Alan?\\
255 - - You took my girl. - And I feel awful about that.\\
256 - - It doesn't matter. - It does matter. I made a terrible mistake.\\
257 - I did the worst thing I could possibly do.\\
258 - I lowered myself to your level.\\
259 - You know what I mean. I love you. You're my brother.\\
260 - - I wouldn't hurt you for the world. - Actions speak louder than words.\\
261 - You're right. Okay. Here's an action.\\
262 - You bought me a bag of cookies.\\
263 - Sure, that should make up for stealing Gabrielle.\\
264 - How about three bags?\\
265 - And I'm breaking it off with her. You can have her back.\\
266 - Have her back?\\
267 - What is wrong with you? She's not a lawn mower you borrowed.\\
268 - You can't just hose off the blades and give her back.\\
269 - - But... But... - "But" nothing.\\
270 - She dumped me because she likes you. So, what are you gonna say to her, Alan?\\
271 - "I was just using you to punish Charlie for something that happened"?\\
272 - I probably wouldn't use those words.\\
273 - You can't ease your conscience about hurting me by hurting her.\\
274 - So you're saying you want me to keep seeing her?\\
275 - I'm saying I want you to do the right thing.\\
276 - - And then you'll forgive me? - Yes, then I'll forgive you.\\
277 - Well, okay.\\
278 - For you, I'll keep seeing the gorgeous woman.\\
279 - Thank you.\\
280 - You're welcome.\\
281 - - Okay, so, what's the catch? - Catch?\\
282 - I don't know what you're talking about.\\
283 - So are you sure everything's okay with Charlie?\\
284 - Everything's great with Charlie. Charlie's fine. Forget Charlie.\\
285 - Well, you know, like the song:\\
286 - Okay.\\
287 - I'm ready.\\
288 - - Excuse me? - Go ahead.\\
289 - Get it over with.\\
290 - - I'm not sure I follow. - Do what you have to do.\\
291 - Just hurry.\\
292 - But don't you wanna start with some kissing...\\
293 - ...and, you know, foreplay?\\
294 - No, thank you.\\
295 - How about a smile?\\
296 - Better?\\
297 - Actually, worse.\\
298 - Could you close your eyes again?\\
299 - - Where are you going? - I have to brush my teeth.\\
300 - The bathroom's that way.\\
301 - Yeah, but my toothbrush is at home. Bye-bye.\\
302 - - Hey. - Hey.\\
303 - How'd it go with Gabrielle?\\
304 - - I think you know how it went. - Yeah, I do.\\
305 - It's kind of like necrophilia, isn't it?\\
306 - - I didn't go through with it. - Really?\\
307 - I guess we're different that way.\\
308 - So I didn't really steal her from you, did I?\\
309 - - Nope. - You were trying to get rid of her.\\
310 - Yep. But I didn't wanna hurt her feelings. Thanks for helping me out with that.\\
311 - Well, at least now we're even, right?\\
312 - - Not quite. - What do you mean?\\
313 - Charlie. Coming back to bed?\\
314 - - Charity? Charity Kirschenbaum? - Oh, hi, Alan. Long time no see.\\
315 - Yeah, 20 years.\\
316 - She looks great, doesn't she?\\
317 - - Come on, baby. - But...\\
318 - Now we're even.\\
319 - I hate you!\\

\subsection {Episode 11: Meander to Your Dander}
1 - Well, that was just lovely.\\
2 - I do aim to please.\\
3 - And after last time, I appreciate the aiming.\\
4 - Hey, we made good time. I can let the babysitter go early.\\
5 - The key is efficient foreplay.\\
6 - Minimal attention to each breast before I meander to your dander.\\
7 - - Spoon? - Sure.\\
8 - And switch.\\
9 - - That was fun. - It always is.\\
10 - Okay, well, drive safe.\\
11 - - I always do. - I know, I'm just a worrier.\\
12 - I know you are.\\
13 - - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.\\
14 - I get more tongue from my butcher.\\
15 - I'm sorry, did you consider making your presence known?\\
16 - Clear your throat, maybe a little cough?\\
17 - I wanted to vomit, but I was afraid it might break the mood.\\
18 - Hey, hey. Postcoital kissing is always more platonic.\\
19 - - Is it? - Yes, because, well...\\
20 - ...we both know where our mouths have been.\\
21 - I see.\\
22 - But in the bedroom, there was a lot of saliva...\\
23 - ...and heat, and friction, believe you me.\\
24 - - Really? - Yes, really.\\
25 - It may not have been crazy, hot, monkey sex...\\
26 - ...like when we first started dating.\\
27 - But it was very much in the general category of jungle humping.\\
28 - - Jungle humping? - Yes.\\
29 - Maybe not tree swinging...\\
30 - ...but certainly canoodling on some low-hanging branches.\\
31 - You poor bastard.\\
32 - Don't you dare feel sorry for me.\\
33 - This is what an adult relationship looks like, Charlie.\\
34 - People get comfortable with each other and develop a routine.\\
35 - And if it's not always fireworks and explosions...\\
36 - ...well, that's a reasonable trade for a warm, collegial partnership.\\
37 - You poor, poor bastard.\\
38 - This conversation is over.\\
39 - If only.\\
40 - Okay, it's boring. It's suffocating.\\
41 - It's a deathwatch, but what choice do I have, Charlie?\\
42 - Pretend I'm you? I'm not you.\\
43 - I'm monogamous, settle-down guy who hangs onto a relationship...\\
44 - ...until I'm looking at divorce papers or the pointy end of a steak knife.\\
45 - Oh, that's a load of crap.\\
46 - You're afraid if you let go of these broads you're never gonna get laid again.\\
47 - Didn't I just say that?\\
48 - Boxing sucks.\\
49 - As always, you're entitled to your stupid opinion.\\
50 - Why are you making it personal? I didn't make it personal.\\
51 - In Ultimate Fighting, they kick, elbow.\\
52 - They get a guy down and smash his head in the floor.\\
53 - These guys just dance around and barely hit each other.\\
54 - Okay, okay, listen to me.\\
55 - Boxing is a science.\\
56 - Boxers don't just whale on each other...\\
57 - ...they strategize, feel each other out, wait for an opening.\\
58 - Gay.\\
59 - And what's with the little pillows on their hands?\\
60 - Even if they hit each other, it wouldn't hurt.\\
61 - Oh, does that hurt?\\
62 - - Yeah. - Good.\\
63 - - Hey, what are you doing? - Uncle Charlie hit me.\\
64 - Good.\\
65 - - Where have you been? - I'll tell you later.\\
66 - Tell him now, I got better things to do.\\
67 - You promised he'd grow on me.\\
68 - I lied.\\
69 - - So where were you? - Well, I thought about what you said...\\
70 - ...and I went over to Donna's house to break up with her.\\
71 - - I'm proud of you. - Thanks.\\
72 - I'm gonna meet her parents next weekend.\\
73 - - But you just said... - I know, but I couldn't do it.\\
74 - I'm not capable of rejecting another human being.\\
75 - Wow, I'd think after all these years, you'd wanna get even.\\
76 - I am in trouble here, Charlie.\\
77 - How do I get out of a stagnant, joyless relationship?\\
78 - If I knew how to do that, you wouldn't still be living here.\\
79 - Okay, first...\\
80 - ...you gotta get your mind right. - How do I do that?\\
81 - Close your eyes and imagine a parallel world...\\
82 - ...where there's an Alan Harper exactly like you.\\
83 - Except he's got a set of balls.\\
84 - - You wanna help me here or not? - Hey, it's gotta be fun for me too.\\
85 - Fine. We'll just assume that your mind is right.\\
86 - Now, before you do the actual dumping, there's a few things you gotta consider.\\
87 - Like what?\\
88 - Does she have embarrassing photographs that could wind up on the Internet...\\
89 - ...if she takes it badly?\\
90 - I'm not sure.\\
91 - What do you mean?\\
92 - Well, there's one of me naked, but I'm wearing a mask and a cape.\\
93 - - I thought the sex was mundane. - Sadly, it still was.\\
94 - Whatever, she can't use the picture.\\
95 - Does she have your credit card information?\\
96 - - No. - Don't answer so quickly.\\
97 - I once handed a date my Visa so she could pump gas for me...\\
98 - ...and on my next statement there were charges...\\
99 - ...for a boob job and a PlayStation 3.\\
100 - And I never got to play with either one of them.\\
101 - You made your date pump gas?\\
102 - I liked the song that was on the radio.\\
103 - But back to the topic at hand. Does she own any chick weapons?\\
104 - Chick weapons?\\
105 - You know, little guns, Tasers, pepper spray.\\
106 - Well, there's a baseball bat by her front door...\\
107 - ...but I think that's for intruders.\\
108 - Yeah, I've made that mistake too.\\
109 - Okay. Let's talk about the where, when and how.\\
110 - Where: Always break up in public place. That way you avoid having a scene.\\
111 - - That makes sense. - When:\\
112 - Before the desert menu comes out. Otherwise, you can find yourself...\\
113 - ...with a lap full of hot coffee, which is not as fun as it sounds.\\
114 - That doesn't sound fun.\\
115 - It sounds fun if you're wearing a couple of doughnuts.\\
116 - Moving on to how.\\
117 - What you wanna convey...\\
118 - ...is your undying affection and gratitude for your time spent together...\\
119 - ...coupled with your need for space to find out who you really are.\\
120 - - But that's crap. - It's all crap.\\
121 - You know it, she knows it, everybody knows it.\\
122 - All we're trying to do...\\
123 - ...is keep her from taking batting practice on your kidneys.\\
124 - Why would she go for my kidneys?\\
125 - Because you'll be running away covering your head.\\
126 - Okay, okay. So I take her to dinner, and then before the coffee comes...\\
127 - ...I tell her that while I have strong feelings for her...\\
128 - ...I need time to find out who I really am.\\
129 - Excellent.\\
130 - Maybe I could throw in some stuff about how I'm still reeling from my divorce.\\
131 - Don't improvise. You don't have the chops for it.\\
132 - - Sorry. - No problem.\\
133 - - I do appreciate the advice. - You're very welcome.\\
134 - A mask and a cape, and the sex was boring?\\
135 - What can I say? She still knew it was me.\\
136 - How do I look?\\
137 - What difference does it make? You're breaking up.\\
138 - I don't want my clothes to say "come hither."\\
139 - Don't worry. As always, they say "your regular teacher is sick."\\
140 - - Are we clear on everything I told you? - Yes.\\
141 - I'm gonna go to her house, pick her up, take her to the restaurant...\\
142 - Pick her up? You're supposed to meet her there.\\
143 - - Why? - What do you mean, why?\\
144 - You're gonna break up with her and then drive her home?\\
145 - You'll need the Jaws of Life to get her out of your car.\\
146 - - You didn't say anything about that. - It's common sense.\\
147 - Do you know why Custer and Sitting Bull didn't share a pony to Little Bighorn?\\
148 - They knew there were gonna be hurt feelings...\\
149 - ...and the ride home would be awkward.\\
150 - - I'm just gonna call her and reschedule. - No, no, no, you're not.\\
151 - Here's what you do.\\
152 - You're gonna pick her up, have a nice dinner...\\
153 - ...drive her home and walk her to her door.\\
154 - - What if she asks me in? - No, never go inside.\\
155 - Everything in her house is a potential weapon.\\
156 - Everything?\\
157 - I was once blinded for two days by potpourri.\\
158 - So you just walk her to her door...\\
159 - ...take her by the hand...\\
160 - ...and tell her that you've had wonderful times...\\
161 - ...and those are the memories you will cherish.\\
162 - You know, we did have wonderful times.\\
163 - Hiking in Catalina, go-carting in Oxnard...\\
164 - ...Oktoberfest in Rosemead.\\
165 - What a day that was. Sharing bratwurst and sauerkraut...\\
166 - ...while listening to the battle of the oompah bands.\\
167 - Oh, God. Do you think I'm making a mistake?\\
168 - No, no, no. The mind plays tricks on us. It only remembers the good times.\\
169 - Or in your case, the creepy, pathetic times.\\
170 - - But I still... - Don't worry, Alan.\\
171 - There'll be other broads to share your bratwurst with.\\
172 - You're right, I have to do this.\\
173 - But wait, what...? What if she starts crying?\\
174 - You hold her in your arms, whisper that this is best for both of you...\\
175 - ...then turn around and walk away like a man.\\
176 - Unless you hear a distinct metallic click, then zigzag and roll.\\
177 - Hi. Come on in.\\
178 - That's okay, I'm kind of hungry. Let's just go.\\
179 - Well, actually, I thought we could stay in tonight.\\
180 - - Really? - I'm making fondue.\\
181 - - Come on. - Oh, goody.\\
182 - Hot cheese and long, sharp forks.\\
183 - This movie is stupid.\\
184 - This movie is a classic.\\
185 - It's been 40 minutes and we haven't even seen the shark yet.\\
186 - That's because they're building suspense, letting you use your imagination.\\
187 - You know what I'm imagining? A better movie.\\
188 - - It's a classic, Jake. - I'll tell you what's a classic.\\
189 - Snakes on a Plane.\\
190 - First, you're in an airplane, which is scary to begin with...\\
191 - ...and then it's all filled with snakes.\\
192 - And they're everywhere.\\
193 - They're in the overhead compartments, in the bathrooms, in the vomit bags.\\
194 - You need to throw up, open the bag, snake.\\
195 - Sounds gripping.\\
196 - Snake.\\
197 - Snake.\\
198 - - That's it. We're out of here. - Where are we going?\\
199 - Someplace public, where killing you would get me in trouble.\\
200 - Fine.\\
201 - Snake.\\
202 - - Great fondue, Donna. - Glad you liked it.\\
203 - Oh, don't forget to put away the little forks.\\
204 - Thanks. Be right back.\\
205 - Oh, good Lord.\\
206 - We've had wonderful times together, Donna.\\
207 - And those are memories I will always cherish.\\
208 - - What? - Nothing.\\
209 - The potpourri.\\
210 - I made coffee.\\
211 - - Hot coffee? - Well, yeah.\\
212 - Of course it's hot.\\
213 - Oh, my. That is potentially scalding.\\
214 - - Blow on it, silly. - Yes, blowing.\\
215 - You blow too.\\
216 - So listen, Donna, there's something we really need to talk about.\\
217 - - What's that? - Well, I was wondering.\\
218 - Are you completely happy in this relationship?\\
219 - - Oh, good, then it's not just me. - What do you mean?\\
220 - Well, I enjoy spending time with you...\\
221 - ...but, honey, I kind of feel like we're getting a little stale.\\
222 - Really? I thought it was going great.\\
223 - Come on, Alan. Our sex life is pathetic. We're just going through the motions.\\
224 - Well, now, hold on. Those motions are tried and true.\\
225 - Call it whatever you want. Tried and true, dull and listless.\\
226 - I wanna call it tried and true.\\
227 - All I know is every time we get in bed, it's the same old thing.\\
228 - The same old thing? What about the mask and cape?\\
229 - It was the same old thing in a mask and cape.\\
230 - Please don't take it personally.\\
231 - Oh, no. How can I possibly take it personally?\\
232 - - You're just telling me I'm a lousy lay. - No, I didn't mean lousy.\\
233 - I meant uninspired, lackluster, predictable.\\
234 - - Okay. - Tedious, mind-numbing, boring...\\
235 - All right, that's it. Come upstairs with me.\\
236 - I will show you tedious, mind-numbing and boring.\\
237 - Oh, God. I'm sorry.\\
238 - - Hot, hot, hot. - What can I do?\\
239 - I don't know, just do something.\\
240 - How can you say this is boring?\\
241 - Wait till you try this. It's the best pizza in town.\\
242 - - Says who? - They put a flyer on Mom's windshield.\\
243 - It said "best pizza in town."\\
244 - Jake, let me give you a little culinary advice.\\
245 - Any restaurant that advertises on windshields...\\
246 - ...and has a guy dressed as a hoagie is probably not the best in town.\\
247 - He wasn't a hoagie, he was a calzone.\\
248 - - Amazing. - What?\\
249 - How can a kid with such lousy taste in pizza and movies...\\
250 - ...have such good taste in girls?\\
251 - - She is kind of cute. - Why don't you go talk to her?\\
252 - I don't know what to say.\\
253 - That's never stopped you from running your mouth before.\\
254 - - What about her mom? - Just stick with the daughter for now.\\
255 - - No, I mean... - I know what you mean.\\
256 - Tell you what. I'll be your wingman.\\
257 - I'll go over and engage the mom in conversation.\\
258 - Then after I grease the wheels, I'll give you a signal.\\
259 - You saunter over and work your magic.\\
260 - - Saunter? - Walk.\\
261 - Well, then just say walk. You don't have to make up words.\\
262 - Wait, what's the signal?\\
263 - - I don't know, I'll give you a thumbs up. - That's not much of a signal.\\
264 - All right, how about I just wave my arms and say, "Yo, dumb-ass."\\
265 - Let's go with the thumb.\\
266 - - Excuse me. - Yes?\\
267 - I'm sorry to interrupt your dinner, but I'm sitting over there with my nephew...\\
268 - - Now? - No, not now.\\
269 - - Dumb-ass. - Now?\\
270 - No.\\
271 - Anyway, he's taken a bit of a shine to your daughter...\\
272 - ...and it would mean the world to him if he could come over and meet her.\\
273 - That's very sweet, and I don't wanna seem impolite...\\
274 - ...but this is our one-on-one time.\\
275 - I understand. You should have that. We're only talking a couple of minutes.\\
276 - - Enough time to put a smile on a boy's... - Now?\\
277 - No.\\
278 - Look, I appreciate you coming over, but I think we'll pass.\\
279 - Fine. Sorry to bother you.\\
280 - Real smooth.\\
281 - Okay, you really gotta help me out here.\\
282 - - Sir, I'm having dinner with my daughter. - And I am here with my nephew.\\
283 - They'd rather be sitting and talking...\\
284 - ...than hanging out with a couple of old farts like us.\\
285 - - What did you call me? - No, no, no. Not you, us.\\
286 - I was being funny.\\
287 - I don't think you're funny at all.\\
288 - Well, clearly you don't know me. I'm Charlie.\\
289 - Yes, well, Charlie, I've asked you to leave us alone.\\
290 - - I understand, and I will, but... - Honey, get me a refill.\\
291 - Yo, dumb-ass. Go get a refill.\\
292 - - Now? - Yes, now.\\
293 - My brother's kid's not real...\\
294 - - I warned you. - God, it's worse than the potpourri.\\
295 - I see you like the diet cola.\\
296 - If I may say so, you don't need to watch your weight.\\
297 - - Here you go. Clean and dry. - Thank you, thank you.\\
298 - - Are you all right? - Oh, yeah. Little Alan's fine.\\
299 - The twins got the worst of it.\\
300 - Good, good.\\
301 - Listen, Donna. You were right.\\
302 - - This relationship is over. - Over?\\
303 - Well, what else is there to do besides call it quits?\\
304 - Oh, I thought maybe we could take it to the next level.\\
305 - Next level?\\
306 - What's beyond mind-numbing, tedious and boring?\\
307 - I'll tell you what's beyond it. Death.\\
308 - No, thank you. Already been married.\\
309 - - But, Alan... - I'm sorry, but it's just...\\
310 - It's time we faced the truth. L...\\
311 - I have no romantic feelings for you anymore.\\
312 - - None? - None at all.\\
313 - Come on, Donna.\\
314 - Crying doesn't solve anything. Believe me.\\
315 - It's better to end this now while we're still friends.\\
316 - - Goodbye, my friend. - Oh, just get out.\\
317 - - What are you doing? - Nothing.\\
318 - - Oh, hi. You must be Alan. - Yes.\\
319 - Forget it, Georgia. It's not gonna happen.\\
320 - What's not gonna happen?\\
321 - I thought I could spice up our relationship with a three-way.\\
322 - A three-way?\\
323 - But I didn't realize you had no romantic feelings for me at all.\\
324 - Now, hang on.\\
325 - I think you may have misinterpreted my remarks.\\
326 - Oh, honey. I'm here for you.\\
327 - Now, see, you really need to be more clear about what you meant...\\
328 - ...by taking it to the next level.\\
329 - See, I'm fine with this.\\
330 - - This could help. - Oh, go to hell.\\
331 - Was the friend good-Iooking?\\
332 - Spectacular.\\
333 - Sounds like you blew what could have been the best night of your life.\\
334 - The best night? No, no. That was the night Jake was born.\\
335 - You have a three-way the night Jake was born?\\
336 - Okay, I blew the best night of my life.\\
337 - Well, don't worry. You'll have another opportunity someday.\\
338 - - How do you figure? - You may have to wait a few decades.\\
339 - But I hear the ratio of gals to geezers in senior-living facilities is two-to-one.\\
340 - Imagine the progress they'll have made in boner pills by that time.\\
341 - Are you staring at me?\\
342 - Because it feels like you're staring at me.\\

1 - Sorry.\\
2 - I hope I'm not coming down with something.\\
3 - You think you might be?\\
4 - Well, I've been feeling a little congested, and I think it's settling in my chest.\\
5 - That's certainly where I was planning to settle.\\
6 - Maybe I should go home.\\
7 - Let's not overreact.\\
8 - We can still do this. We just have to be careful.\\
9 - What do you mean?\\
10 - Well, we can keep kissing...\\
11 - ...but, you know, Amish-style with the tongues parked in the barn.\\
12 - If you need to cough or sneeze, tap me on the shoulder...\\
13 - ...and I'll cover your face with a pillow.\\
14 - And...\\
15 - - You can use this. - Nasal spray.\\
16 - Thank you. That's so thoughtful.\\
17 - Well, you are gonna need to breathe through your nose.\\
18 - - Wanna see a movie today? - With you?\\
19 - - Yeah, with me. - No, thanks.\\
20 - Okay.\\
21 - - Wanna do something else? - Like what?\\
22 - I don't know. Anything.\\
23 - Well, can we go to Les Girls, Girls, Girls?\\
24 - - What? - That place near the airport.\\
25 - Looks real interesting. I think it's French.\\
26 - No, no, we're not going to Les Girls, Girls, Girls.\\
27 - Then don't say we can do anything.\\
28 - Okay, forget it.\\
29 - - You really wanna do something? - Yes.\\
30 - How about, drive me to the mall, so I can see a movie with friends...\\
31 - ...and then you pick me up when we're done?\\
32 - And what am I supposed to do?\\
33 - Well, if I were you, I'd go to Les Girls, Girls, Girls.\\
34 - Who's going to Les Girls, Girls, Girls?\\
35 - - Nobody. - Too bad.\\
36 - Daytime's better.\\
37 - Dancers are a little worse for wear, but they try harder.\\
38 - Oh, God, I should have sent that woman home...\\
39 - ...as soon as I saw the first snot bubble.\\
40 - I'm done.\\
41 - Me too. Get dressed. I'll drive you to the mall.\\
42 - Cool.\\
43 - Will you make me soup before you go?\\
44 - - I don't have time, Charlie. - But I'm sick.\\
45 - - Who's gonna take care of me? - What do you want me to say?\\
46 - Maybe if you bothered to develop a human relationship...\\
47 - ...that involved more than the thoughtless exchange...\\
48 - ...of bodily fluids, you'd have somebody to take care of you.\\
49 - The whole time you were talking, you could have opened a can of soup.\\
50 - Morning.\\
51 - Hey, Berta.\\
52 - What's wrong with you?\\
53 - I caught something.\\
54 - There's a surprise.\\
55 - Yeah, it's really bad.\\
56 - Throat, sinuses, stomachaches, chills.\\
57 - I swear to God, I feel like I'm gonna die.\\
58 - Okay.\\
59 - Well, good luck.\\
60 - This is it.\\
61 - I'm a goner.\\
62 - Hello?\\
63 - Anybody here?\\
64 - Anybody gonna take care of good old Charlie?\\
65 - Okay, then.\\
66 - Time to scrape the bottom of the barrel.\\
67 - Mommy, I don't feel good.\\
68 - Oh, Charles, don't tell me you've got another case of the Bangkok drippy-drip.\\
69 - No offense.\\
70 - No, no, it's just a cold or a flu.\\
71 - And this concerns me how?\\
72 - Well, I thought maybe you could come over and make me some soup...\\
73 - ...or put a cool, wet cloth on my head.\\
74 - Oh, darling, I'd love to.\\
75 - But, unfortunately, Mommy's sick too.\\
76 - All right, that does sound bad.\\
77 - Oh, it is.\\
78 - What was that?\\
79 - Oh, just my delirious fever babble.\\
80 - Bye, dear.\\
81 - All right. I'm on my own.\\
82 - Maybe a little fresh air and sunshine.\\
83 - And nighttime cold medicine.\\
84 - Fresh air, sunshine, and nighttime cold medicine.\\
85 - And Scotch.\\
86 - Fresh air, sunshine, nighttime cold medicine...\\
87 - ...and Scotch.\\
88 - Okay.\\
89 - Just nighttime cold medicine and Scotch.\\
90 - Hey, Charlie.\\
91 - Rose? I thought you were in England.\\
92 - I was asked to leave.\\
93 - A little misunderstanding at Buckingham Palace.\\
94 - So how are you?\\
95 - Not too good. I'm sick.\\
96 - Poor baby.\\
97 - Isn't anybody taking care of you?\\
98 - No. I'm all alone.\\
99 - Well, that's just not right.\\
100 - I'll take care of you.\\
101 - - You will? - Of course.\\
102 - Do you want me to make you some soup?\\
103 - I would love soup.\\
104 - I asked everybody to make me soup. You'd think I was asking for a kidney.\\
105 - - What are you doing? - Nighttime cold medicine and Scotch.\\
106 - I call it the Drunken Hulk.\\
107 - No, sweetie. I have something better.\\
108 - I doubt it.\\
109 - Well, this is new.\\
110 - Just approved in Europe.\\
111 - Oh, Europe. Give me.\\
112 - That's my little man.\\
113 - Now I'll go and make you that soup.\\
114 - Thank you.\\
115 - Okay, Europe, let's see what you got.\\
116 - That was a great pill.\\
117 - What was in that pill? That's a great pill.\\
118 - Don't you worry about that.\\
119 - You just get your rest.\\
120 - You know what else is great?\\
121 - You showed up exactly when I needed you the most.\\
122 - It's like you're my guardian angel.\\
123 - Hey, you think I can get another one of those pills?\\
124 - No, sweetie.\\
125 - One's enough for now.\\
126 - Just go to sleep.\\
127 - Okay.\\
128 - Good night.\\
129 - Good night, Charlie.\\
130 - Can you hear me?\\
131 - Listen closely to my voice.\\
132 - You're very, very sick.\\
133 - I'm very, very sick.\\
134 - But don't worry.\\
135 - Rose is gonna take care of you.\\
136 - Rose is gonna take care of me.\\
137 - Till death do us part.\\
138 - I'm gonna need another pill.\\
139 - Wouldn't kill you to thank me for dropping you off and picking you up.\\
140 - Thank you for dropping me off and picking me up.\\
141 - - Jake, Jake, wait. - What?\\
142 - Okay, listen, I know you're getting to that age where you'd...\\
143 - ...rather be with your friends than your old man, and that's okay.\\
144 - It's completely normal for you to wanna take your first steps...\\
145 - ...to manhood on your own.\\
146 - I applaud that.\\
147 - But I just hope that, while you're on this path, that every now and then...\\
148 - ...you'll make an effort to carve out a little Dad time.\\
149 - Well, that was humiliating.\\
150 - Charlie?\\
151 - How are you feeling?\\
152 - - Rose? - Hi, Alan.\\
153 - - What are you doing here? - Taking care of Charlie.\\
154 - I'm very, very sick.\\
155 - Go for it.\\
156 - So how long are you back in town?\\
157 - As long as Charlie needs me.\\
158 - Well, don't let that big baby take advantage of your good nature.\\
159 - Don't worry, Berta. I'm fine taking care of him.\\
160 - Well, that's good, because nobody else wants to.\\
161 - The truth is, I just love feeding him, cleaning him, changing him.\\
162 - - You're changing him? - Cleaning him?\\
163 - You know, if you stop feeding him, you won't have to change him.\\
164 - I don't mind. I'm a loving nurturer.\\
165 - Uncle Charlie says you're a crazy stalker.\\
166 - Potato, potato.\\
167 - Hey, Rose, you wanna go see a movie later?\\
168 - Maybe. We'll see how your uncle's feeling.\\
169 - He's very, very sick.\\
170 - So, basically, what we're saying here is...\\
171 - ...you'll go to the movies with anybody but me.\\
172 - Not anybody.\\
173 - I wouldn't go with Hitler.\\
174 - Charlie?\\
175 - I'm in here.\\
176 - What are you doing out of bed?\\
177 - What do you think?\\
178 - Let me help you.\\
179 - Yeah, Rose, I got this.\\
180 - Just relax, sweetie.\\
181 - I said I got it.\\
182 - Let go.\\
183 - You're sick. You shouldn't be lifting anything.\\
184 - All right. I'm done.\\
185 - Need a shake?\\
186 - No, thanks.\\
187 - Okey-dokey.\\
188 - Now let's get you back into bed.\\
189 - Rose, I appreciate you taking care of me, but I'm thinking the worst is over.\\
190 - That's your mind playing tricks on you.\\
191 - If you start running around too soon, you'll relapse.\\
192 - - Maybe get pneumonia. - Pneumonia?\\
193 - Lungs fill up with fluid. You can't breathe.\\
194 - And you end up drowning in your own mucus.\\
195 - You don't want that, do you?\\
196 - I don't wanna drown in anybody's mucus.\\
197 - Of course, you don't.\\
198 - Open.\\
199 - Good boy.\\
200 - I am really lucky to have you, Rose.\\
201 - You know what, Charlie?\\
202 - I think we make our own luck.\\
203 - - We do? - Well...\\
204 - I do.\\
205 - Rose?\\
206 - Hello?\\
207 - Anybody there?\\
208 - What the hell?\\
209 - Oh, that's not right.\\
210 - Alan. Alan.\\
211 - Alan!\\
212 - What's the matter?\\
213 - How long have I been up here?\\
214 - - I don't know. About two weeks? - Two weeks?\\
215 - Didn't you think to check on me?\\
216 - Well, frankly, everything was going so smoothly around here.\\
217 - It never occurred to me.\\
218 - - Are those knit booties? - What?\\
219 - - I don't know. - Since when do you wear knit booties?\\
220 - Since when do I have turquoise fingernails?\\
221 - - Where's Rose? - She went to the movies with Jake.\\
222 - God forbid my son should go anywhere with his father.\\
223 - - I mean, I have tried everything... - Alan, listen to me.\\
224 - - You cannot let Rose back in this house. - Why not?\\
225 - The cold pills she's been giving me are not cold pills.\\
226 - - What do you think they are? - I don't know.\\
227 - Something you give to elephants when they can't sleep.\\
228 - - Elephants? - European elephants.\\
229 - You know, I think you might be delirious.\\
230 - - You really should lie down. - Screw that.\\
231 - I'm getting out before she comes back.\\
232 - Are those comfy? Because they look really comfy.\\
233 - Charlie.\\
234 - What are you doing up?\\
235 - Stay away from me, Rose.\\
236 - - What's wrong, honey? - Don't you call me honey.\\
237 - Charlie, Charlie, you need to calm down.\\
238 - Calm down?\\
239 - Thanks to her, I've been a drooling vegetable for weeks.\\
240 - I was afraid of this. He's running a very high fever.\\
241 - - He's hallucinating. - I am not running a fever. Here, feel me.\\
242 - I am not hot.\\
243 - A little clammy and none too fresh, but not hot.\\
244 - Just relax, baby. You need your rest.\\
245 - No, no, no, what I need is a lawyer.\\
246 - Alan, please, you gotta believe me. I am not sick.\\
247 - I believe you. Now, lay down.\\
248 - - But, Alan... - It's for your own good.\\
249 - Okay. Okay, you're right.\\
250 - I'm crazy from the fever.\\
251 - Not crazy, honey.\\
252 - Just very, very sick.\\
253 - Now, open up.\\
254 - Good boy. Swallow.\\
255 - There you go. Now, get some rest.\\
256 - So does a guy have to be sick to get a pair of those booties?\\
257 - Thank God she wasn't using suppositories.\\
258 - Son of a bitch.\\
259 - Charlie, are you up?\\
260 - Alan.\\
261 - - What are you doing? - Escaping.\\
262 - Charlie, this isn't a good time.\\
263 - I've already had my second cup of coffee.\\
264 - Look, I don't know how long I've got.\\
265 - Neither do I.\\
266 - Oh, damn it. She's out.\\
267 - - Out of what? - Her freaking mind.\\
268 - Charlie, where are you?\\
269 - Oh, God, she's coming. Is your door locked?\\
270 - No. Neither was my window.\\
271 - Two mistakes I will never make again.\\
272 - Charlie, are you in here?\\
273 - - Rose. - Sorry, Alan. Have you seen Charlie?\\
274 - Bathtub.\\
275 - For God's sake, Alan, you're my brother.\\
276 - Oh, Charlie, is this how you act after everything I've done for you?\\
277 - Yes. This is how I act.\\
278 - Playing Anne Frank in the bathtub.\\
279 - Well, I give up. I can't take care of you if you won't cooperate.\\
280 - Oh, no, no, Rose. Let's not be hasty.\\
281 - It's been so nice these last couple of weeks.\\
282 - What if Charlie promises to behave himself?\\
283 - I am not promising Nurse Ratched anything.\\
284 - Well, then I guess I'll just leave.\\
285 - - You're not leaving. - I was bluffing.\\
286 - - Rose. - Darn.\\
287 - I hope you are proud of yourself. All she was trying to do was help.\\
288 - No, no, no, that's not what she was trying to do.\\
289 - This was all a plot.\\
290 - It started with getting me sick.\\
291 - She drugged me to keep me helpless so she could move in...\\
292 - ...and have her way with me. - Oh, really? Rose got you sick.\\
293 - Nothing to do with sticking your tongue down the throat of a flu-riddled bimbo?\\
294 - I'm not saying I know how she did it, but she did it.\\
295 - Any idea how insane this makes you sound?\\
296 - I have proof. Come on, I'll show you.\\
297 - Charlie?\\
298 - Fine. I'll wait outside.\\
299 - I'm bored. Wanna go see a movie?\\
300 - - Now? - Well, you got the listings there.\\
301 - Jake, for the love of God.\\
302 - Fine. But don't say I never ask.\\
303 - You'll see. I have proof.\\
304 - I didn't swallow the last pill, so we can have it analyzed.\\
305 - Right. I'll call CSI and have them run some tests.\\
306 - I hid it under my pillow and...\\
307 - Okay, I don't have proof.\\
308 - Rose?\\
309 - Oh, hi, Lulu.\\
310 - - How'd your plan work out? - Well, you were fine.\\
311 - But I think I may have overplayed it.\\
312 - If you wanna take another swing at him, I'm coming down with mono.\\
313 - Oh, Charlie's already had mono.\\
314 - Give me a call if you get mumps or whooping cough.\\
315 - Will do.\\
316 - Oh, Rose.\\
317 - Oh, God, not another one.\\
318 - Resynced by Ubolena.
\subsection {Episode 13: The Soil Is Moist}
1 - Not only did that movie suck, it blew chunks, bit the big one...\\
2 - ...and then came back and sucked again.\\
3 - - Did you pay for it? - Yeah.\\
4 - With an hour and a half of my childhood that I'll never get back.\\
5 - Hey, I've seen your childhood. It's not a big loss.\\
6 - - You said you wanted to see it. - It was rated R.\\
7 - But there wasn't a single boob in it.\\
8 - - You were there. - Oh, my God.\\
9 - I know, and he talks to me that way all the time.\\
10 - That's Cynthia Sullivan.\\
11 - Who is Cynthia Sullivan?\\
12 - - She and her husband used to be friends. - Yeah, so?\\
13 - I haven't seen her since Judith and I split.\\
14 - I don't know if I should say hello. They took Judith's side in the divorce.\\
15 - Wait a minute. We're allowed to take sides?\\
16 - Nobody told me. Is it too late?\\
17 - That's not funny, Charlie.\\
18 - He's very hurtful to everybody, and for no reason.\\
19 - Alan?\\
20 - Oh, hey, Cynthia.\\
21 - - Hi. - Wow, what a nice surprise.\\
22 - - How are you? - Just great.\\
23 - It's been a long time.\\
24 - Hi, Jake. Look how big you're getting.\\
25 - It's called puberty.\\
26 - It's called doughnuts.\\
27 - Doughnuts don't make hair.\\
28 - Cynthia, this is my brother, Charlie.\\
29 - - Hello. - Hi.\\
30 - Cynthia and her husband were friends with me...\\
31 - ...back when we were, you know, me and Judith.\\
32 - - And when we were me and Bill. - You're not with Bill anymore?\\
33 - No. We decided to finally stop kidding ourselves.\\
34 - - You know how it is. - I do.\\
35 - No, you don't.\\
36 - Of course I do.\\
37 - - Did you get the house in the divorce? - Yes.\\
38 - Not sleeping on your brother's Hide-A-Bed?\\
39 - - No. - You don't know how it is.\\
40 - Again, completely unmotivated.\\
41 - Well, okay. It was really nice to see you again, Alan.\\
42 - - We should get together sometime. - Yeah, that would be nice.\\
43 - Nice meeting you. Bye, Jake.\\
44 - - You dog. - What?\\
45 - Oh, come on, the full-frontal hug, the "let's get together."\\
46 - Isn't that like soccer mom talk for "Do me in the cul-de-sac"?\\
47 - - What are you snickering at? - Oh, tell me that's not dirty.\\
48 - Go get us a table. Come on. Charlie, you don't understand.\\
49 - She and her husband were our best friends for like 10 years.\\
50 - We traveled together. We spent vacations together.\\
51 - And you never fantasized about boinking her?\\
52 - She was Judith's friend. I was her husband's friend.\\
53 - Of course I did.\\
54 - Yeah, hi. Two regular coffees, please.\\
55 - And one chocolate crappuccino with whipped cream and sprinkles.\\
56 - Well, here's your chance to fulfill your fantasy.\\
57 - - Oh, no, no, I couldn't. - Why not?\\
58 - I don't wanna upset Judith. They're still friends.\\
59 - Alan, the fact that you're still drawing breath upsets Judith.\\
60 - I couldn't go out with Cynthia without clearing it with her.\\
61 - I am not whipped. What if the positions were reversed?\\
62 - Like Judith was single and wanted to date you?\\
63 - I would certainly want her to check with me before I, you know...\\
64 - ...blew my brains out.\\
65 - Is that all it would take? What's her number?\\
66 - - Where did you get that? - I found it on the table.\\
67 - Oh, Jake.\\
68 - It's okay. I'm eating on the side without teeth marks.\\
69 - Puberty, my ass. That's a missing chromosome.\\
70 - No, I'm pretty sure it's a bear claw.\\
71 - - Hey, honey, how was...? - Not now. I gotta go to the bathroom.\\
72 - Please tell me you didn't let him eat a lot of crap.\\
73 - Let him? Judith, our son is a billy goat.\\
74 - I wouldn't be surprised if he's in there pooping out tin cans.\\
75 - - Lovely. - Oh, wait, Judith.\\
76 - - I wanted to ask you something. - What?\\
77 - Well, we were just having coffee, and I happened to run into...\\
78 - Charlie, can you give us a minute?\\
79 - No, I wanna watch this.\\
80 - - Why? - I think it might amuse me.\\
81 - Yeah, well, seek amusement elsewhere.\\
82 - Fine. I'll go talk to Herb.\\
83 - Of all Judith's husbands, he's my favorite anyway.\\
84 - You know, Jake's right. Sometimes you can be hurtful for no reason at all.\\
85 - So who did you run into?\\
86 - - Oh, Cynthia Sullivan. - Okay. So?\\
87 - Well, I know you're still friends, and I was wondering...\\
88 - ...if you'd be okay if I asked her out.\\
89 - - Fine. - Really?\\
90 - Sure. You're both adults. You're both single...\\
91 - ...and, most importantly, she won't go out with you.\\
92 - - How do you know? - I know.\\
93 - Has she said something to you?\\
94 - No, but you're not her type.\\
95 - - Oh, really? What is her type? - Well, like her ex-husband.\\
96 - Smart, funny, sensitive, good-Iooking.\\
97 - - And that's not me? - No, no. You can be funny.\\
98 - Okay, okay. But if she did agree to go out with me...\\
99 - ...you'd be okay with that? - But she won't.\\
100 - - But if she did? She might. - She won't. She won't.\\
101 - You know, Charlie's not the only one who can be hurtful for no reason.\\
102 - You know, Herb, that is a fine, fine hat.\\
103 - Gotta wear it. Otherwise, I freckle like a banana.\\
104 - Well, I wouldn't want your banana to get freckled.\\
105 - - Let's go, Charlie. - Hang on, hang on.\\
106 - We're having a real interesting conversation here.\\
107 - Hey, Herb, tell Alan what you told me about how you plant seeds.\\
108 - Well, first I make sure the soil is moist.\\
109 - And tell him how you do that.\\
110 - Well, I just stick my finger into old mother earth.\\
111 - If it comes up dry, I just whip out my hose and give it a good spritz.\\
112 - And then?\\
113 - And then I carefully plant the seed in the soil.\\
114 - Carefully? Why carefully?\\
115 - Because if you just fling that stuff around, half of it's wasted.\\
116 - You hear that, Alan? If you fling your seed around, it gets wasted.\\
117 - - Fascinating. Let's go. - Now hold on, hold on.\\
118 - How do you feel about bushes, Herb?\\
119 - Well, I like a full bush.\\
120 - The way God intended.\\
121 - I like them trimmed.\\
122 - - What about you, Alan? - We're going. Bye, Herb.\\
123 - Bye, fellas.\\
124 - - Why do you do that to him? - It amuses me.\\
125 - Oh, oh, great. So I will pick you up tonight at 7.\\
126 - Yeah, yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.\\
127 - Okay, okay. Bye.\\
128 - Yes.\\
129 - Judith said Cynthia wouldn't go out with me, and she was wrong, so:\\
130 - - Look, I told you she'd go out with you. - And you were right, sir.\\
131 - I ignore you at my own peril...\\
132 - ...when it comes to women, liquor and venereal disease.\\
133 - Then listen to me now.\\
134 - Be prepared for sex tonight.\\
135 - Sex? It's a first date.\\
136 - Not really. You and Cynthia are old friends. You know each other.\\
137 - You like each other. You might as well smell like each other.\\
138 - - No, I don't think so. Not Cynthia. - Not Cynthia?\\
139 - Alan, the woman's pushing 40. She's coming off a divorce.\\
140 - And praying that her looks hold out so she can snag some loser...\\
141 - ...she wouldn't have been caught dead with five years ago.\\
142 - Oh, boy, I'm getting laid tonight.\\
143 - - I'm saying. - I wish I could rub Judith's nose in this.\\
144 - That would be a huge:\\
145 - Don't worry. Judith will find out.\\
146 - - Are you gonna tell her? - No.\\
147 - Would you?\\
148 - Alan, Cynthia will tell her.\\
149 - - Oh, right, right, they're friends. - More importantly, they're women.\\
150 - You know how they are:\\
151 - They tell each other everything.\\
152 - Trust me, it'll be like Judith is watching every move you make tonight.\\
153 - Every move?\\
154 - - So bring your A game. - Right, right.\\
155 - What if I don't have an A game?\\
156 - You better find one, because you don't wanna get yanked off the mound.\\
157 - - Where you going? - To warm up the old pitching arm.\\
158 - - I'm using a metaphor. - So am I.\\
159 - Oh, Alan, I have fantasized about this for so long.\\
160 - Me too. Ever since we all went to Disney World...\\
161 - ...and you wore that white T-shirt on Splash Mountain.\\
162 - Are you sure this isn't going too fast?\\
163 - Not a chance. I've been warming up all afternoon.\\
164 - Oh, real smooth, Alan.\\
165 - Go, ahead. I'm just gonna sit here and watch every move you make.\\
166 - Oh, Alan, that was remarkable.\\
167 - Remarkable good, right?\\
168 - Oh, yeah.\\
169 - I have to admit, I was a little worried that this might be awkward.\\
170 - How come?\\
171 - Well, I mean, you know, I am friends with Judith.\\
172 - - We do talk. - No kidding.\\
173 - Well, the next time you talk, be sure to use the word "remarkable."\\
174 - Oh, Alan, look, I'm not like that. I mean, I believe in discretion.\\
175 - Really? I think it's overrated.\\
176 - - Go ahead. Tell her. - No.\\
177 - I wish Judith had a little more discretion.\\
178 - What do you mean?\\
179 - Well, she just goes on and on about her sex life with Herb.\\
180 - Big Bird's pretty boring, huh?\\
181 - No. I mean, the way she tells it, he is an amazing lover.\\
182 - Yeah, that's what I thought... Wait.\\
183 - Wait, wait. Herb Melnick is an amazing lover?\\
184 - Yeah. She said he was the best that she's ever had.\\
185 - No. No.\\
186 - That can't possibly be right.\\
187 - How can that be?\\
188 - Well, apparently, he's just...\\
189 - No, I can't go into that.\\
190 - Sure, you can. Go ahead.\\
191 - No. You know, it wouldn't be right.\\
192 - I'm sorry. Just forget I said anything.\\
193 - Best she's ever had.\\
194 - Oh, Herb, you're the best I've ever had.\\
195 - - Morning. - Morning.\\
196 - So how'd it go last night?\\
197 - You were right. We had sex.\\
198 - Then why the long face, Seabiscuit?\\
199 - You're so much better than the only other man I've ever been with.\\
200 - I've just got something on my mind.\\
201 - Like what?\\
202 - I had no idea what I was missing.\\
203 - Forget it.\\
204 - - Oh, come on. What's bothering you? - Nothing. I'm fine.\\
205 - Oh, come on.\\
206 - Come on, what?\\
207 - In what universe is Herb Melnick a better lover than me?\\
208 - Herb Melnick?\\
209 - I thought you had sex with Cynthia last night.\\
210 - I did, but you know what she told me?\\
211 - That Judith told her that Herb was the best lover she's ever had.\\
212 - How does that come up while you're boffing Cynthia?\\
213 - - What difference does it make? - I'm just trying to picture the context.\\
214 - "Oh, Cynthia, I am so turned on right now.\\
215 - I wonder how Herb does it to Judith."\\
216 - No, it wasn't like that.\\
217 - Okay, was it like, "Golly, you have firm buttocks.\\
218 - You know who else has a nice ass? Herb Melnick"?\\
219 - I didn't bring up the subject of Herb's sexual prowess. Cynthia did.\\
220 - Oh, that's never a good sign.\\
221 - Fifteen years Judith and I were together. Twelve years of marriage...\\
222 - ...and the best sex we ever had was mediocre.\\
223 - If you were having bad sex, why did you marry her?\\
224 - What kind of stupid question is that? I told you, we were having sex.\\
225 - But she never enjoyed it. Certainly never sought it out.\\
226 - Then Herb Melnick comes along with his tousled hair and goofy charm...\\
227 - ...and lights her up like an all-night liquor store.\\
228 - So you're saying Farmer Herb's tilling soil...\\
229 - ...you couldn't even get your hoe into.\\
230 - - My hoe? - Yeah. You know, with an E? Hoe.\\
231 - - Fine, yes. - And it's bothering you to know...\\
232 - ...that night after night he's planting a tree in Israel.\\
233 - By Israel, I mean, Judith.\\
234 - - Yes. - And by tree, I mean...\\
235 - I know what you mean. Okay, I get it. God, why do you do this to me?\\
236 - Haven't I made that clear? It amuses me.\\
237 - It's driving me nuts. I mean, what's his secret? How does he do it?\\
238 - Maybe he's got a big trouser monkey.\\
239 - - You been listening this whole time? - Wouldn't you?\\
240 - You think she's right? You think he's just well-endowed?\\
241 - He could be. He's, what, 6" 4', got big hands.\\
242 - If everything is proportional...\\
243 - ...I'm guessing he could ring doorbells with that thing.\\
244 - - You're not helping. - I rarely do.\\
245 - Oh, Alan, you're looking at this the wrong way.\\
246 - What do you mean?\\
247 - Well, you're seeing your ex-wife as half-empty.\\
248 - - But with Herb in the picture... - Shut up.\\
249 - Oh, get a room.\\
250 - - Oh, Alan. - Oh, Cynthia.\\
251 - Oh, Herb.\\
252 - Hey, buddy.\\
253 - - Okay, okay, I can't do this. - Oh, well, what's the matter?\\
254 - I gotta know. What makes Herb the best Judith's had?\\
255 - I thought we settled this.\\
256 - Yeah, but it's driving me crazy. Is it just physical endowment?\\
257 - What?\\
258 - You know, can he put a hat on it and drive in the carpool lane?\\
259 - I am not gonna repeat what a friend said to me in confidence.\\
260 - Don't give me that. You're a woman. That's all you guys do:\\
261 - You know what I think? I think that you're still not over Judith.\\
262 - Oh, please. I don't care about Judith.\\
263 - I can't wrap my head around Herb's penis.\\
264 - Okay. I just realized why your marriage ended.\\
265 - - Why? - Something is very wrong with you.\\
266 - Oh, that.\\
267 - I think you should go home.\\
268 - - But you said I was remarkable. - Get out.\\
269 - Fine.\\
270 - Okay. I'll see you guys at home.\\
271 - - Hey, fellas. - Hey.\\
272 - - Here to pick up Jake? - Yeah.\\
273 - - Another weekend with the boy. - Gonna take him to the movies.\\
274 - Oh, okay.\\
275 - - Well, he's waiting for you. - Great, great.\\
276 - Yeah, come on, Alan.\\
277 - - I didn't see anything. Did you? - Nothing jumped out at me.\\
278 - I just don't get it. What is his secret?\\
279 - - Maybe he doesn't have a secret. - What do you mean?\\
280 - I mean, you didn't set the bar too high to begin with.\\
281 - It's like Judith spent 15 years living on peanut butter and jelly.\\
282 - If someone comes along and offers bologna...\\
283 - ...she's gonna think it's a steak sandwich.\\
284 - Jake, your father's here.\\
285 - So I'm sorry to hear about you and Cynthia.\\
286 - - She told you. - Of course she told me. We're friends.\\
287 - Did she happen to mention the word "remarkable"?\\
288 - No, but she did say she didn't think you were over me.\\
289 - - Oh, he's over you. Right, Alan? - Right.\\
290 - But what's the deal with Herb's junk?\\
291 - - What? - Nothing, nothing.\\
292 - - Hey, Dad. - Hey, buddy, let's go. Bye, Judith.\\
293 - - Real subtle. - Sometimes you just gotta ask.\\
294 - - See you on Sunday, Herb. - Okay, have a good weekend.\\
295 - Wow, look at him go.\\
296 - Okay, mystery solved.\\
297 - Good for you. Never too late to learn.\\
298 - Resynced by Ubolena.
\subsection {Episode 14: Winky-Dink Time}
1 - Taste this.\\
2 - I don't need to taste it. It's a chocolate laxative.\\
3 - I think it needs more caramel.\\
4 - I'm telling you, Alan.\\
5 - One of these days, that kid's gonna fart and birds are gonna fall out of the sky.\\
6 - Funny. Listen, how much is a hooker?\\
7 - What? Alan, what are you gonna do with a hooker?\\
8 - Well, I'd like to pay her to have sex with me.\\
9 - - I get it, but why? - Well, I've been thinking.\\
10 - I don't have a great track record with relationships...\\
11 - ...but I still have desires.\\
12 - So I figure, why not simplify?\\
13 - Get back to basics.\\
14 - No relationship, no disappointment, just sex.\\
15 - Well, sex with you...\\
16 - ...there's bound to be some disappointment.\\
17 - I mean, even with a hooker, money only buys you so much goodwill.\\
18 - But I don't have to care. Because it's a straight business transaction...\\
19 - ...the only needs that are important are mine.\\
20 - Hey, you don't have to sell me on it.\\
21 - I just never pictured you doing anything like this.\\
22 - Me neither. You know what's interesting?\\
23 - Once I decided to give up trying to live a moral life, I felt somehow free.\\
24 - Again, you don't have to sell me on it. How much are you looking to spend?\\
25 - Well, as you know, I am a bit of a bargain hunter.\\
26 - But unfortunately, they don't stock hookers at the 99-cent store.\\
27 - - Give me a number. - Okay, well...\\
28 - ...what could I get in the 200-dollar range?\\
29 - Crabs.\\
30 - And carjacked.\\
31 - All right, then. Why don't you give me a number?\\
32 - - Fifteen hundred dollars. - For one night?\\
33 - For one hour.\\
34 - One hour? I want sex, not surround sound.\\
35 - Trust me, it's worth it.\\
36 - For that kind of money, you get the girlfriend experience.\\
37 - Haven't you been listening? I don't want the girlfriend experience.\\
38 - I want sex.\\
39 - Guiltless, emotionless, selfish sex.\\
40 - - I understand. - At a reasonable price.\\
41 - Got it. I'll make a few calls, see what I can do.\\
42 - That'd be good. And try to get a non-smoker.\\
43 - Sure.\\
44 - Who wants a girl who would put one of those nasty things in her mouth?\\
45 - Charlie?\\
46 - Charlie Harper?\\
47 - Hey, how are you?\\
48 - Wow, how long has it been?\\
49 - Too long. This is my brother, Alan.\\
50 - Hi. This is my daughter, Milly.\\
51 - - Hi, Milly. - Hello, Milly.\\
52 - Boy, this is some killer crumb cake.\\
53 - - Hello. - Hi.\\
54 - Milly, this is my son, Jake. Jake, this is Milly.\\
55 - Want some cake?\\
56 - I don't eat sugar.\\
57 - Oh, yeah, me neither.\\
58 - Unless it's in, like, pies and cookies and stuff.\\
59 - - Whatever. - Yeah, whatever.\\
60 - I play guitar. I'm in a band.\\
61 - They're called the Dudes of Rockage. Heavy metal, classic rock kind of stuff.\\
62 - - I'm into Gwen Stefani. - Oh, yeah, they're great.\\
63 - - Sure you don't want some cake? - No, thanks.\\
64 - Oh, gee, we have to get going.\\
65 - Call me sometime. Maybe we can get together, have dinner, catch up.\\
66 - Oh, that'd be great.\\
67 - You still have my number?\\
68 - I'm sure I do, but, you know, just in case.\\
69 - Here you go.\\
70 - - Pleasure to meet you, Alan. - Same here.\\
71 - She seems nice. Who is she?\\
72 - I have no frigging idea.\\
73 - I'll tell you who she is.\\
74 - The grandmother of my children.\\
75 - - Uncle Charlie? - What?\\
76 - Could you do me a favor and call Milly's mom, find out if Milly likes me?\\
77 - But don't tell her I asked, because I don't wanna appear needy.\\
78 - I'm on it.\\
79 - You're not gonna do it, are you?\\
80 - What was your first clue?\\
81 - Oh, come on, why not?\\
82 - Jake, buddy, I don't even remember who Milly's mom is.\\
83 - Calling her would put me in a very awkward position.\\
84 - More than the time I had to pretend to be lost at the mall...\\
85 - ...so you could meet the cute guard? - Hey, we both benefited from that.\\
86 - - How do you figure? - I got a hot date. You got a hot pretzel.\\
87 - It was an excellent pretzel.\\
88 - Did you make the call?\\
89 - Jeez, everybody wants me to pimp for them.\\
90 - Might as well get myself an orange hat, platform shoes and a full-length fur coat.\\
91 - If anybody could pull it off, it'd be you.\\
92 - Did you make the call?\\
93 - Here. Her name's Alexis.\\
94 - She's expecting to hear from you.\\
95 - Alexis, that's a pretty name.\\
96 - They all have pretty names, Alan.\\
97 - You'll never meet a hooker named Maude.\\
98 - Right, right. So exactly how much are we talking about?\\
99 - She's willing to throw you one for 500.\\
100 - Okay.\\
101 - Can I put it on a credit card?\\
102 - A credit card?\\
103 - Where are you planning to swipe it, Alan?\\
104 - All right, all right, I was just hoping to get the miles.\\
105 - Forget the miles.\\
106 - And remember, that 500 does not include the tip.\\
107 - I have to tip her?\\
108 - You know, in case there's something you want that might be considered unusual.\\
109 - Oh, yeah, I'm gonna have to tip her.\\
110 - - Hi. - Oh, hey, Berta.\\
111 - Hey, Berta.\\
112 - So, what you're saying is that this is a  -la-carte kind of deal.\\
113 - Like a steakhouse?\\
114 - What?\\
115 - As opposed to a set menu or buffet style.\\
116 - Sure, whatever.\\
117 - Should I mention your name when I call?\\
118 - Absolutely.\\
119 - For every referral, I get a free travel mug.\\
120 - Okay, terrific. Thank you, Charlie.\\
121 - Happy to help.\\
122 - Zippy getting a hooker?\\
123 - - It would appear so. - Boy, talk about earning your money.\\
124 - Look, all you gotta do is call her mother, talk to her, then ask if Milly's there.\\
125 - And if she is, you hand me the phone.\\
126 - - You're not gonna let this go, are you? - Did you get a look at her?\\
127 - Jake, buddy, I don't even know her mother's name.\\
128 - So? You don't know the name of half the girls you bring over.\\
129 - First month I was here, you called me Jack.\\
130 - All right, all right.\\
131 - I will call her, dance around the fact that I have no idea who the hell she is...\\
132 - ...then hand you the phone.\\
133 - - Great. - As long as you're hooking people...\\
134 - Forget it.\\
135 - Oh, come on, I'm not picky.\\
136 - Just find me a young Andy Griffith.\\
137 - Just remember, I'm doing you a favor.\\
138 - Don't forget it in a few years when I ask you to change my diaper.\\
139 - Okay.\\
140 - Wait, what?\\
141 - Hey, hi, it's Charlie.\\
142 - Yeah, it was great to see you too.\\
143 - Listen, let me tell you why I'm calling.\\
144 - I'm sitting here with my nephew...\\
145 - Yeah, he does like his cake.\\
146 - Remind her I'm in a band.\\
147 - Hang on.\\
148 - - You gonna let me do this? - You're rambling.\\
149 - Fine. It's all yours.\\
150 - Hello, is Milly there?\\
151 - Oh, okay, well, can you tell her that Jake Harper called?\\
152 - The kid with the band?\\
153 - Really? Sure, I guess so.\\
154 - Okay, thanks. Bye.\\
155 - You and me are having dinner with them on Friday, so you can catch up.\\
156 - You and me?\\
157 - Just don't clock block me, okay?\\
158 - - Clock block you? - That's not it?\\
159 - No, that's not it.\\
160 - Jake, let's go.\\
161 - - How do I look? - Like you should be knocking on doors...\\
162 - ...asking people if they've heard the good news.\\
163 - I already told all my friends I have a date.\\
164 - Wasn't gonna wear the jacket. The shirt has mustard on the back.\\
165 - How did you get mustard on the back of your shirt?\\
166 - A kid bet me I couldn't catch a hot dog behind my back.\\
167 - Turns out I couldn't.\\
168 - Is that what you're wearing?\\
169 - - What's wrong with it? - Nothing. It's fine.\\
170 - No, no, no, please, Mr. Blackwell, I want your opinion.\\
171 - Would it kill you to tuck your shirt in?\\
172 - I would, but I just sat in some Thousand Island dressing.\\
173 - Been there, done that.\\
174 - All right. Get in the car.\\
175 - Alan, we're leaving.\\
176 - Okay, have fun.\\
177 - I'm going on a double date with pumpkin head.\\
178 - Fun's not an option.\\
179 - Well, whatever. I know it means a lot to him.\\
180 - That's good, because his happiness is everything to me.\\
181 - Oh, Charlie, wait.\\
182 - - Yeah? - Guess who's coming over tonight.\\
183 - Alexis.\\
184 - Oh, good for you.\\
185 - But if you're planning to use that vegetable oil...\\
186 - ...it's probably gonna run you an extra hundred.\\
187 - I'm making French fries.\\
188 - You know, carb-Ioading for my upcoming 60-minute dash.\\
189 - My mistake.\\
190 - But I like how you think. Kinky and heart-smart.\\
191 - - Right. - Wait, wait, wait, one more thing.\\
192 - - Is this like parking at the mall? - What?\\
193 - If I go over five minutes, do I have to pay for a whole other hour?\\
194 - No, it's like a tollbooth.\\
195 - At the end of the hour, a gate comes down and lops off your penis.\\
196 - Have fun.\\
197 - Do me a favor.\\
198 - If you get a chance, ask Milly what her mother's name is.\\
199 - Why don't you ask her?\\
200 - Because women don't like it when you forget their names.\\
201 - Well, then why do you always do it?\\
202 - Why do you always eat pastrami when you know it gives you gas?\\
203 - Because I love pastrami.\\
204 - Well, there you go.\\
205 - But I always know it's called pastrami.\\
206 - - Just ask her. - Okay.\\
207 - Now, let's talk about your date.\\
208 - - You need to get your ducks in a row. - What do you mean?\\
209 - If this little girl is important to you, it'd behoove you to have a plan.\\
210 - Behoove?\\
211 - It would benefit you.\\
212 - Oh, yeah, sure.\\
213 - What was that thing about ducks?\\
214 - It's just an expression.\\
215 - - Well, it's confusing. - Sorry.\\
216 - You can't get them in a row.\\
217 - I know, I know, now just listen to me.\\
218 - - They're ducks. - Right.\\
219 - They move willy-nilly.\\
220 - Shut up.\\
221 - It would behoove you to speak nicer to me.\\
222 - I swear to God, I will open the sunroof, pick you up with one hand...\\
223 - ...and toss you into the carpool lane.\\
224 - You know, there's no reason we couldn't be in the carpool lane.\\
225 - All right, all right, I'm listening.\\
226 - Thank you.\\
227 - Now, three rules.\\
228 - Number one, dinner with a beautiful woman is never about food.\\
229 - - I know, it's about making her like me. - Very good.\\
230 - - But there will be food, right? - Yes.\\
231 - Because I'm not at my best when I'm hungry.\\
232 - Jake, you need to focus here.\\
233 - It would behoove me to focus.\\
234 - Sorry, what are the other two rules?\\
235 - Number two, eat with your mouth closed.\\
236 - Number three, pray she has low self-esteem.\\
237 - Number three isn't a rule.\\
238 - For you, it is.\\
239 - Fine. Now, let's go over my three rules.\\
240 - You've got rules?\\
241 - Number one, I'd like you not to call me Mr. Potato Head...\\
242 - ...or SpongeBob SmearPants.\\
243 - How about Sir Farts a Lot?\\
244 - No.\\
245 - Number two, I think it'd be better...\\
246 - ...if I call you Charlie rather than Uncle Charlie.\\
247 - Because that way, we'd be more like equals.\\
248 - So if we're equal, does that mean you're gonna split the check with me?\\
249 - I knew you'd say that, Charlie.\\
250 - And number three?\\
251 - Oh, there's only two. I miscounted.\\
252 - Roxanne, you don 't have to Put on the red light\\
253 - Those days are over\\
254 - You don 't have to Sell your body to the night\\
255 - Oh, wait, you do.\\
256 - Here we go.\\
257 - Make me proud.\\
258 - Hey, Alan.\\
259 - Rose?\\
260 - Oh, for God's sake, did Charlie put you up to this?\\
261 - What? Charlie didn't put me up to anything.\\
262 - Right, so it's just a coincidence I'm waiting for a prostitute...\\
263 - ...and you show up at the front door.\\
264 - You're waiting for a prostitute?\\
265 - No.\\
266 - Oh, Alan, that's not like you.\\
267 - When you've had your heart broken enough times...\\
268 - ...and you can't bear having an emotional connection...\\
269 - ...with another human, what else is there?\\
270 - A lot of people masturbate, I hear.\\
271 - Really, I've heard them.\\
272 - Nevertheless, sometimes a man needs to feel something...\\
273 - ...other than his own touch.\\
274 - Have you tried switching hands?\\
275 - It's like being with a clumsy stranger.\\
276 - Hi.\\
277 - Hi, you must be Alan's prostitute. I'm Rose.\\
278 - Hi, Rose. Will you be joining us tonight?\\
279 - No, you'll just be doing Alan this evening.\\
280 - Good night, Rose.\\
281 - Good night.\\
282 - So come on in.\\
283 - Sorry I'm a little late.\\
284 - Oh, that's okay.\\
285 - As long as it doesn't come out of my, you know, winky-dink time.\\
286 - Charlie, you haven't changed a bit in all these years.\\
287 - It has been years, hasn't it? How many years do you think it's been?\\
288 - I don't know, probably 12.\\
289 - - And how old are you, honey? - Fourteen.\\
290 - Thank heaven.\\
291 - For little girls.\\
292 - - So, Milly, do you play dodge ball? - No.\\
293 - I enjoy it quite a bit because it's just man against man...\\
294 - ...but with big red balls.\\
295 - - Lx-nay on the alls-bay. - What?\\
296 - Just don't say balls.\\
297 - So are you living in the same place?\\
298 - Yeah, still in my condo.\\
299 - Right, the condo.\\
300 - Boy, that takes me back.\\
301 - - I don't think you were ever there. - That's what I meant.\\
302 - Takes me back to not being there.\\
303 - The thing about dodge...\\
304 - ...round things is the thrill of competition and the deep satisfaction you get...\\
305 - ...when you see a kid's retainer fly out of his mouth...\\
306 - ...when he takes one to the face. - I hate dodge ball. It's too violent.\\
307 - You're right. It sucks.\\
308 - Milly enjoys painting and writing poetry.\\
309 - You know, like me.\\
310 - Of course I know. How could I not know?\\
311 - - Are you still doing the whole art thing? - What do you mean?\\
312 - I mean, that thing you used to do with the art.\\
313 - And the poetry.\\
314 - Milly, did Jake tell you he was in a band?\\
315 - Yeah, I'm in a band.\\
316 - I don't think she has low self-esteem.\\
317 - Shall we take care of business before we get started?\\
318 - Oh, absolutely. No money, no honey.\\
319 - No looty, no booty.\\
320 - No cash advance, I'm not in your pants.\\
321 - - That was 400, right? - Five.\\
322 - Oh, of course.\\
323 - Why do I think it was four?\\
324 - Thanks. So, Alan, what do you like?\\
325 - Oh, just about anything. I'm not finicky.\\
326 - No limits, huh?\\
327 - Well, you know, I'm not into animals or anything near my keister.\\
328 - Okay, come here.\\
329 - Let's get comfy.\\
330 - Oh, alrighty.\\
331 - Baby, you really turn me on.\\
332 - - Hang on a sec. - What?\\
333 - I'm a little bumped by that "turn me on" part.\\
334 - I wanna believe you, but I've been with enough women...\\
335 - ...to know that it doesn't happen that fast.\\
336 - Sometimes it doesn't happen at all.\\
337 - Honey, I would not lie to you.\\
338 - No, no, of course not. Why would you lie to me?\\
339 - But I'm just saying it would help...\\
340 - ...if you could tone down the narration to a more believable level.\\
341 - - All right. - Okay.\\
342 - You are the best kisser.\\
343 - - Okay, again. - What?\\
344 - I happen to know for a fact that I'm not the best kisser.\\
345 - Okay, I'm a little confused here.\\
346 - I'm just not buying it.\\
347 - And since I am buying it, I should be able to buy it.\\
348 - All you have to do is tell the truth. There's no need for hyperbole.\\
349 - - All right, okay. - Okay.\\
350 - Oh, Alan, your lips are so...\\
351 - ...thin and dry.\\
352 - Okay, now we're cooking.\\
353 - I think competitive eating really changed...\\
354 - ...when that Japanese guy started wetting the hot-dog buns.\\
355 - I actually figured out that trick myself.\\
356 - By accident.\\
357 - So how are your folks doing?\\
358 - That's not funny, Charlie.\\
359 - You know, I meant, how are they doing in heaven?\\
360 - - What are you talking about? - Hell?\\
361 - Are you referring to their divorce?\\
362 - Yes, I am, and divorce is hell. But after a while, it can be like heaven.\\
363 - You know, you're even prettier than I remember.\\
364 - Thank you. And you are just as charming as the first time we met.\\
365 - - Oh, you don't remember that. - I sure do.\\
366 - - It was a really hot day in July... - Hot dog eaters are amateurs.\\
367 - The guys that do pork ribs and spaghetti, they're the real athletes.\\
368 - Hey, hey, hey, the lady's talking here.\\
369 - Oh, right. Milly, Charlie wants to know what your mom's name is.\\
370 - You don't remember my name?\\
371 - What? Of course I do.\\
372 - You're gonna listen to SpongeBob SmearPants?\\
373 - Oh, you wanna play like that, huh, Mr. Drunky Face.\\
374 - - What's my name, Charlie? - Just a sec.\\
375 - How's your lobster? Do you need more butter?\\
376 - Because there's plenty on Jake's shirt.\\
377 - You have no idea what my name is, do you?\\
378 - He doesn't have a clue.\\
379 - Okay, okay, okay, I'm not good with names.\\
380 - But I'll never forget the passionate nights we spent together.\\
381 - - We never spent the night together. - We didn't?\\
382 - - No. - Well, no wonder I don't remember you.\\
383 - Come on, honey, we're leaving.\\
384 - No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.\\
385 - I gotta know.\\
386 - Who the hell are you?\\
387 - - Nice going. - Me?\\
388 - - You're putting this on me? - Can I bring you anything else?\\
389 - Yeah, get me a bottle of Scotch, a taxi and a smarter kid.\\
390 - Can I have a chocolate mousse, please?\\
391 - Oh, come on, I just said I can't believe I'm the biggest you've ever seen.\\
392 - I mean, I'm not even the biggest I've ever seen.\\
393 - - And I haven't seen that many. - I'm sorry, I have to go.\\
394 - - Why? - I have a headache.\\
395 - I can work with that. I was married for 12 years.\\
396 - Here's your money. Don't ever call me again.\\
397 - Okay, second base for free.\\
398 - So are either of you gonna tell me how it went tonight?\\
399 - Ask your bubble-headed son.\\
400 - Ask your butt-headed brother.\\
401 - You know what?\\
402 - I'm not that interested.\\
403 - I'm going to bed.\\
404 - Oh, no, stay.\\
405 - I so enjoy your company.\\
406 - So how'd it go with Alexis?\\
407 - Well, I don't wanna brag, but she wouldn't take my money.\\

1 - - Alan, I need to talk to you. - Okay.\\
2 - - Alone. - Gotta be about sex.\\
3 - Take a hike.\\
4 - I'm 14. You're not protecting me anymore.\\
5 - - Jake. - This is just a pathetic sham.\\
6 - - So, what's up? - Okay, long story short.\\
7 - - I've got a young woman upstairs. - Wow, I didn't see this one coming.\\
8 - See her? I'm surprised you couldn't hear her.\\
9 - She was like a cat in a fan belt.\\
10 - Anyway, I need you to entertain her in my absence.\\
11 - Entertain her? What did you have in mind?\\
12 - A musical number from Sweeney Todd?\\
13 - How young is she? Maybe a little peekaboo.\\
14 - Right there. That's why no one likes you.\\
15 - Just keep her occupied till I get back.\\
16 - - Where are you going? - I have a date.\\
17 - A date? It's 8:30 in the morning.\\
18 - I know what time it is. I have a limited window of opportunity here.\\
19 - Her husband's playing nine holes, so I thought...\\
20 - ...I'd try and play a couple myself.\\
21 - Then why don't you just send the other girl home?\\
22 - I'll be back by noon. What am I supposed to do the rest of the day?\\
23 - Okay, okay.\\
24 - I'm gonna say something now, because, well, I think it needs to be said.\\
25 - - What? - You're a severely damaged human being.\\
26 - Hey, I'd love to stay and chitchat with you...\\
27 - ...but I've got a golf widow marinating in Brentwood.\\
28 - Wait, wait. What am I supposed to tell the girl upstairs?\\
29 - I don't know. Tell her I went out to give blood.\\
30 - That way, if I come back a little weak, I've got a good excuse.\\
31 - So you want me to just lie to her?\\
32 - It's up to you. You could tell her the truth.\\
33 - But then you'd have to pack up all your crap and move into the lifeguard station.\\
34 - Why do you gotta do that?\\
35 - Why is it always "my way or the highway"?\\
36 - "Obey my commands or you're out."\\
37 - Then again, if the system works, why mess with it?\\
38 - Boy, they left the faucet on a long time when they poured those legs.\\
39 - I don't believe it. Another one.\\
40 - Oh, hey, Alan.\\
41 - - Who's the blond? - Don't know.\\
42 - Found her on the beach.\\
43 - Like homeless?\\
44 - Not tonight.\\
45 - You realize that's three in one day.\\
46 - Depends how you count. I make it out to be seven.\\
47 - Or eight.\\
48 - I should carry a clicker.\\
49 - Oh, Charlie, even for you, this is ridiculous.\\
50 - Hey, one man's ridiculous is another man's "yabba dabba doo."\\
51 - "I should carry a clicker."\\
52 - By the way, I'm Charlie.\\
53 - - I'm Gretchen. - I like that. Gretchen.\\
54 - It's got a built-in:\\
55 - Upstairs on the right.\\
56 - - Make yourself comfortable. - Okay.\\
57 - - Charlie Harper? - Yeah?\\
58 - Keep your hands off my wife.\\
59 - Yes, sir. No problem.\\
60 - God, Charlie, are you okay?\\
61 - No, I'm not okay. I just got punched in the face.\\
62 - Help me up.\\
63 - That was an angry husband, wasn't it?\\
64 - Well, you can't really blame him.\\
65 - From now on, he's gonna have to take his wife golfing with him.\\
66 - Wait a second. You're still going upstairs?\\
67 - Why not? It wasn't her husband.\\
68 - But you're bleeding.\\
69 - Did you see that girl?\\
70 - I'd be climbing these stairs if I was just a head and a spine.\\
71 - Berta, have you noticed anything different about Charlie lately?\\
72 - - What did you mean? - Well, he's always been promiscuous...\\
73 - ...but I'm starting to think I should hide my bowling ball.\\
74 - I know what you're saying.\\
75 - I'm having to change his sheets so often...\\
76 - ...I'm thinking about putting them on a roller.\\
77 - Have you seen him act this way before?\\
78 - Well, when Viagra first came out, I thought he was gonna die.\\
79 - Know how they say if your erection lasts for more than four hours...\\
80 - ...you should call your doctor?\\
81 - He'd just call another girl.\\
82 - For a while there, he had to stand on his head to take a leak.\\
83 - - Morning. - Morning.\\
84 - Rough night in Hump Junction?\\
85 - No, it was good.\\
86 - I just had a little accident.\\
87 - I tried to pick my lady friend up and put her on the bureau...\\
88 - ...and now I can't find one of my testicles.\\
89 - Oh, Charlie.\\
90 - I don't think I really lost it.\\
91 - It's kind of like your keys.\\
92 - Even if you can't put your hands on them...\\
93 - ...you know they gotta be somewhere.\\
94 - That is something you do not wanna find in the vacuum bag.\\
95 - You know, I'm really starting to worry about him.\\
96 - I feel like I should do something.\\
97 - The way he's been acting, if I were you...\\
98 - ...I'd start sleeping on my back wearing a catcher's mask.\\
99 - Good news. I found it.\\
100 - It's always the last place you look.\\
101 - - You sure you're up for this? - I'm fine.\\
102 - Just a little tender in the giblets.\\
103 - Yeah, you're fine.\\
104 - Two beers, please.\\
105 - Oh, yeah, much better.\\
106 - - What are you doing? - What do you think I'm doing?\\
107 - Scouting the talent.\\
108 - Are you out of your mind?\\
109 - What's your pickup line?\\
110 - "Wanna come back to my place and help me look for my balls?"\\
111 - It was one ball, and I found it.\\
112 - Charlie, don't you think you need to slow down a bit?\\
113 - Why would I wanna do that?\\
114 - Oh, come on.\\
115 - Is this lifestyle actually making you happy?\\
116 - Let me answer that question with another question.\\
117 - Who would you rather be? You or me?\\
118 - You're kidding, right?\\
119 - You have two black eyes and you're perched on a scrotum cozy.\\
120 - You.\\
121 - - Hi. - Hey there.\\
122 - Oh, sweet Lord.\\
123 - Can I buy you a drink?\\
124 - If you want to.\\
125 - Well, I'd like to buy you an airplane, but let's start with the drink.\\
126 - - I'm Charlie. - Pepper.\\
127 - Oh, my favorite condiment.\\
128 - - It's a spice. - Shut up.\\
129 - So, Charlie...\\
130 - No kidding.\\
131 - Well, then...\\
132 - All right, you're under arrest for solicitation.\\
133 - Stand up, put your hands behind your back and spread your legs.\\
134 - I'm afraid you're gonna have to choose one.\\
135 - Now will you admit you've got a problem?\\
136 - Hey, that was entrapment.\\
137 - I'm the victim here.\\
138 - If she wasn't a cop, what did you think you were gonna do with her?\\
139 - I really don't know.\\
140 - Charlie, don't you see what's happening to you?\\
141 - Nothing's happening, except I offered to buy a policewoman a $500 martini.\\
142 - Well, then there's no point in my talking to you anymore.\\
143 - All right. Then something good came of this.\\
144 - You stay away from my girlfriend.\\
145 - You're gonna have to be more specific.\\
146 - Son of a bitch.\\
147 - So, Charlie, what's been going on?\\
148 - Well...\\
149 - ...I've got a new career.\\
150 - As a crash-test dummy?\\
151 - Writing songs for little kids.\\
152 - - Really? - Yeah.\\
153 - Turns out immature minds respond to me.\\
154 - Sounds about right.\\
155 - Let's see. What else?\\
156 - My mom's getting married. Nice guy.\\
157 - - Good for her. - Yeah, yeah.\\
158 - - My brother still lives with me. - Sure.\\
159 - We knew he wasn't going anywhere.\\
160 - Let's see.\\
161 - My nephew's growing like a weed.\\
162 - My ex-fianc e's getting married. I've been dating. Nothing serious.\\
163 - And as you can see, I've had a couple of mishaps.\\
164 - Well, except for the facial lacerations and the rectal doughnut...\\
165 - ...hardly noticeable.\\
166 - It's actually a testicular doughnut.\\
167 - - What's the difference? - About that much.\\
168 - Well, that's disturbing.\\
169 - Let's circle back to the ex-fianc e.\\
170 - - What was her name? - Mia.\\
171 - Mia. How do you feel about Mia getting married and moving on with her life?\\
172 - I feel fine about it. I'm happy for her.\\
173 - No remorse, no regrets?\\
174 - Not really. It's been a long time.\\
175 - Okay.\\
176 - So when did you learn about her upcoming nuptials?\\
177 - I don't know. A couple of weeks ago.\\
178 - Yep, two weeks.\\
179 - You carry the announcement around with you?\\
180 - - Yeah. Why? - No reason.\\
181 - And you say you've been dating a lot.\\
182 - - A little more than usual. - When did that new pattern start?\\
183 - Gee, I don't know. It's gotta be a couple of weeks now.\\
184 - - What? - Oh, come on, Charlie.\\
185 - Just because I get paid by the hour doesn't mean this should take forever.\\
186 - It's pretty clear that the news about this woman getting married...\\
187 - ...has hurt you, and you're acting out.\\
188 - Man, you shrinks wanna bring everything back to feelings, don't you?\\
189 - Think it has anything to do with your toilet training?\\
190 - - No. - Then I guess we're stuck with feelings.\\
191 - Now, when you read that announcement, how did you feel?\\
192 - I don't know. How you feel when the woman you were once in love with...\\
193 - ...is getting married to another guy. - Describe it.\\
194 - - Describe it? - Just for fun.\\
195 - It's hard to say exactly.\\
196 - I guess it's kind of like...\\
197 - ...a trapdoor opens up under your feet and you're falling.\\
198 - And at the same time, there's this enormous pressure on your chest...\\
199 - ...like a big animal, maybe a possum or a raccoon...\\
200 - ...is sitting on it.\\
201 - And you can't catch your breath.\\
202 - Possum or a raccoon.\\
203 - - Lf you're writing it down, say raccoon. - Will do.\\
204 - I don't know why I said possum.\\
205 - It's okay.\\
206 - Do you think it's possible that this feeling of falling...\\
207 - ...and the raccoon on your chest is a physical manifestation...\\
208 - ...of unexpressed grief?\\
209 - - Grief? - You know, sadness.\\
210 - How do you read sadness into that?\\
211 - Look, Charlie, you're a smart guy.\\
212 - Emotionally:\\
213 - But you gotta see what's going on here.\\
214 - You're using this series of meaningless sexual liaisons...\\
215 - ...to run away from your feelings about losing this woman.\\
216 - No, no, I'm sorry. I don't see it.\\
217 - Let's keep looking.\\
218 - What about my mom getting married? That can upset a fella, right?\\
219 - Make him go all ancient Greek and poke his eyes out?\\
220 - Oh, come on, Charlie, you loved this woman.\\
221 - And I'd say you still love her.\\
222 - And deep down, maybe you were hoping someday you'd get back together.\\
223 - And the only reason you're not sitting here weeping...\\
224 - ...is because it's too painful for you.\\
225 - I'm sorry. I just can't see it.\\
226 - You can't see it because your penis is in the way.\\
227 - Thank you.\\
228 - Not a compliment, Charlie.\\
229 - Says you.\\
230 - Look, you have a very simple choice here.\\
231 - You can honestly confront these emotions...\\
232 - ...and learn the lessons they bring...\\
233 - ...or you can drive yourself into an early grave with indiscriminate sex.\\
234 - Define "early."\\
235 - What are you doing?\\
236 - I'm trying to feel my feelings.\\
237 - Really?\\
238 - - How's it going? - Not well.\\
239 - See? Nothing, no grief.\\
240 - What exactly are you trying to grieve over?\\
241 - Well, Mia's getting married...\\
242 - Wait, wait, wait. Mia?\\
243 - - The one you were gonna marry? - Yeah.\\
244 - And my shrink thinks I'm pretty upset about it.\\
245 - Do you think you're upset about it?\\
246 - I don't know.\\
247 - - I really did love her. - I know you did.\\
248 - Yeah.\\
249 - I remember this one time...\\
250 - ...we were driving to Santa Barbara for the weekend...\\
251 - ...and she just smiled at me.\\
252 - And I thought:\\
253 - "Man, I could spend the rest of my life with this woman, no problem."\\
254 - And then...\\
255 - Then I lost her.\\
256 - And I don't think I'm gonna find anybody like her again.\\
257 - What the hell is going on, Alan?\\
258 - This is good. This is good. You're finally starting to feel your grief.\\
259 - And once you really feel it and accept it...\\
260 - ...you can get on with your life without Mia.\\
261 - - Really? - Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Let it out.\\
262 - No, this is crap.\\
263 - Where are you going?\\
264 - I just realized...\\
265 - ...I won't have to feel my feelings and live without Mia if I just go get her back.\\
266 - - That's your solution? - Yeah... right?\\
267 - Indeed.\\
268 - Forgot my doughnut.\\
269 - You laugh, but it really does help.\\
270 - Bride? Seen the bride?\\
271 - - I got a delivery for the bride. - I think she's in there.\\
272 - Thanks. Here you go.\\
273 - You look so beautiful.\\
274 - You are so lucky.\\
275 - - Hey. - Charlie.\\
276 - What are you doing here?\\
277 - - I came to get you back. - Are you out of your mind?\\
278 - No, no. I got the idea from my shrink.\\
279 - Could you ladies give us a minute?\\
280 - - Okay. One minute. - Thanks.\\
281 - How are you? Looking good.\\
282 - Don't worry, your big day will come.\\
283 - Charlie, I'm getting married in an hour.\\
284 - - So I'm not too late. - Oh, you are so too late.\\
285 - Just hear me out.\\
286 - Oh, my God, what happened to you?\\
287 - No big deal.\\
288 - I just yanked a kid out of the way of a speeding bus.\\
289 - Got clipped by the side mirror.\\
290 - Okay, that's a bunch of crap.\\
291 - But this is the truth.\\
292 - Mia, I have never felt about any woman like I feel about you.\\
293 - And the thought of you marrying some other guy is...\\
294 - It's breaking my heart.\\
295 - So I'm just going for broke here.\\
296 - Mia, I love you.\\
297 - I will always love you, and I want you to marry me.\\
298 - Honey, the photographer wants to...\\
299 - - What's going on? - Daddy, I told you about Charlie Harper.\\
300 - - Remember? - Oh, good. I'm glad you're here, sir.\\
301 - I'd like to ask you for your...\\
302 - How much did you tell him?\\
303 - Thanks.\\
304 - - You need some more ice for your jaw? - No.\\
305 - - Your nose? - No.\\
306 - How about the chestnuts?\\
307 - - Resting comfortably. Thanks. - Okay. Well, try to get some sleep.\\
308 - - Alan? - Yeah?\\
309 - I learned something about myself.\\
310 - That you're a bleeder?\\
311 - I learned why I screw around so much.\\
312 - - Really? - Yep.\\
313 - I think I've spent my whole life...\\
314 - ...trying to fill the empty space in myself by, you know...\\
315 - Filling the empty space in others.\\
316 - Exactly.\\
317 - That's quite an insight.\\
318 - Well, I'm deep in therapy now.\\
319 - You went for one hour, Charlie.\\
320 - Fifty minutes. It's kind of a racket.\\
321 - But the point is, I've hit bottom.\\
322 - I can't keep going like this.\\
323 - - It's time for me to grow up. - I agree.\\
324 - So, what are you gonna do?\\
325 - Well, I thought I'd find some chick with a big heart and a tiny ass...\\
326 - ...and marry her.\\
327 - Maybe that girl from the beach. She seemed nice.\\
328 - - You're going to get married? - Yep.\\
329 - Settle down, have a couple of kids and ship the penis up to Cooperstown.\\
330 - Cooperstown?\\
331 - It is my bat.\\
332 - Well, sounds like you've got everything figured out.\\
333 - You don't ever figure this stuff out, Alan.\\
334 - You just take little baby steps on a lifelong path to becoming a better man.\\
335 - How many pain pills have you taken?\\
336 - Nine.\\
337 - Good night.\\
338 - Might not be a bad idea to check on me in an hour or so.\\
339 - - Make sure I'm still breathing. - I always do.\\

1 - So I'm thinking we serve the good wine before the ceremony...\\
2 - ...and then at the reception, after everybody's got a buzz on...\\
3 - ...we uncork the crap.\\
4 - Alan, I do not want to cheap out on what is very possibly my last wedding.\\
5 - He's always been stingy.\\
6 - I remember once when he was a little boy, he accidentally swallowed a quarter.\\
7 - Refused to poop for a week.\\
8 - Mom, for God's sakes, this is my future stepsister.\\
9 - Oh, relax, Alan. I think it's cute.\\
10 - Cute? He's so tight, I wouldn't have been surprised if only two dimes came out.\\
11 - Mom, I'm begging you.\\
12 - Would you feel better if I told you something embarrassing about me?\\
13 - - Yes. - Promise not to laugh?\\
14 - - I promise. - All right.\\
15 - I have never in my life refused to poop.\\
16 - You are so mean. I love you.\\
17 - I think I liked it better when you two didn't get along.\\
18 - Well, those days are over.\\
19 - Once I saw how happy Evy makes my father, I could've married her myself.\\
20 - Oh, thank you, sweetheart. And you're like the daughter I never had.\\
21 - Not that he didn't try.\\
22 - You should have seen him parading around in my earrings and my high heels.\\
23 - "Look at me, Mommy, I'm pretty."\\
24 - He wasn't, of course.\\
25 - Oh, darling, I'm just teasing you.\\
26 - You're all man.\\
27 - Thanks.\\
28 - Okay, let's talk appetizers.\\
29 - Hey, Alan, how long do I have before Bridezilla gets here?\\
30 - Gee, Charlie, I don't know what you're talking about.\\
31 - She's already here, isn't she?\\
32 - Yes, dear. Come on down.\\
33 - It's a little game we play.\\
34 - I show him unconditional love, and he's an ungrateful little pissant.\\
35 - - Hey, Mom. - Hello, dear.\\
36 - You remember Teddy's daughter, Courtney?\\
37 - How could I forget?\\
38 - - Nice to see you again. - Nice to see you too.\\
39 - Courtney and your brother are helping me with the wedding arrangements.\\
40 - It's your fifth wedding, Mom. What do you need help with?\\
41 - Besides remembering the groom's name?\\
42 - I'd cut him out of the will if I thought there was a chance he'd outlive me.\\
43 - Hello? Oh, Teddy, darling.\\
44 - What's up?\\
45 - Excuse me.\\
46 - That's wonderful. Can you keep it up till I get there?\\
47 - All right, I want to make sure we're all on the same page here.\\
48 - This wedding will be ruined if Mom finds out...\\
49 - ...her son and future stepdaughter have been carrying on behind her back.\\
50 - - Don't worry. - She won't.\\
51 - No, I do worry. There can be no flirting, no innuendo.\\
52 - Don't worry about "innuendo," worry about "in-her-end-o."\\
53 - Everybody keeps their troublemakers in their pants.\\
54 - Hey, I'll cooperate, but I can't speak for my troublemaker.\\
55 - Alan, Teddy wants to talk to you about the boutonnieres.\\
56 - Coming.\\
57 - I knew he'd fight me on this.\\
58 - So when can we get together?\\
59 - We can't. You and I are done.\\
60 - Why? Just because of what Alan said? Nobody listens to Alan.\\
61 - Hell, half the time, Alan doesn't listen to Alan.\\
62 - I finally have a good relationship with your mother. I'd like to keep it.\\
63 - Hey, a good relationship with my mother is highly overrated.\\
64 - Look at me, I've gone my whole life without one.\\
65 - Charlie, get it through your head. You and I, no more.\\
66 - If it were that simple, they wouldn't call it "troublemaker."\\
67 - I'd like to make a little toast. To our families coming together.\\
68 - Hear, hear.\\
69 - - To coming together. - No.\\
70 - Evelyn is gaining a daughter and I'm gaining two sons.\\
71 - - And a grandson. - Don't interrupt.\\
72 - I'd like to say something else. I want this to be an old-fashioned marriage.\\
73 - Darling, what's mine is yours.\\
74 - We do not need a prenup.\\
75 - Teddy, we've talked about this.\\
76 - You have a lot of money. You should be protected.\\
77 - I don't need to be protected from you, baby.\\
78 - - Daddy, wait a minute. - This is none of your business.\\
79 - - But, Dad. - But nothing.\\
80 - I love this woman.\\
81 - And I'm not gonna bet against our marriage...\\
82 - ...by bringing a bunch of lawyers into it.\\
83 - - He must really love her. - Yeah.\\
84 - The schmuck.\\
85 - Excuse me.\\
86 - I had a thought about the ice sculpture.\\
87 - A lot of people go with Cupid...\\
88 - ...but you gotta remember, the bow and arrow melts first...\\
89 - ...and what you're left with is a fat kid dancing in shrimp.\\
90 - There's gonna be shrimp?\\
91 - For the guests.\\
92 - - So what am I? - Don't feed me straight lines, dear.\\
93 - Excuse me.\\
94 - Why would I feed her straight lines if there's shrimp?\\
95 - - I'll be out in a minute. - I can't wait. You'd better let me in now.\\
96 - Charlie, get out of here.\\
97 - Oh, come on. You can't just cut me off like this.\\
98 - Hey, I can cut off whoever or whatever I want.\\
99 - Are you playing hard-to-get because you know it turns me on?\\
100 - I'm not playing, Charlie.\\
101 - Okay, I just have to say, not playing turns me on more.\\
102 - Charlie, are you in there with Courtney?\\
103 - No.\\
104 - - Hi, Courtney. - Hey, Alan.\\
105 - - I thought we had an agreement. - Yeah.\\
106 - The agreement was Mom doesn't find out.\\
107 - Courtney? Are you okay, dear?\\
108 - Oh, I'm fine, Evelyn.\\
109 - I thought you might be upset about that prenup nonsense.\\
110 - And I just want you to know, I'm not after your father's money.\\
111 - I'm sure you're not.\\
112 - Believe me, I've got plenty of my own money.\\
113 - Of course, don't tell Alan and Charlie, they're annoying enough as it is.\\
114 - I won't.\\
115 - So exactly how rich are you?\\
116 - I do all right.\\
117 - When you marry my grandma, what does that make you to me?\\
118 - Nothing.\\
119 - Sorry, dear.\\
120 - Oh, that's all right. I was talking to the kid.\\
121 - - Isn't that nice? - You know, even if we're not related...\\
122 - ...you could still buy me birthday and Christmas presents.\\
123 - Thanks for the tip.\\
124 - I don't believe it.\\
125 - If Mom's got so much money, how come we still get books for Christmas?\\
126 - Let it go, Alan.\\
127 - Whatever money she has most likely has got an ancient curse attached to it.\\
128 - - What are you doing? - I'm here, I figured what the hell?\\
129 - - Remember to put the seat back down. - It's a ladies' room.\\
130 - Why do they even go up?\\
131 - I don't know. It's a bigger target for broads who want to puke their dinner.\\
132 - Makes sense.\\
133 - All right, let's talk about Courtney.\\
134 - - What do you want me to tell you? - Why you're so obsessed with her.\\
135 - Isn't it obvious? She drinks, she smokes, she gambles.\\
136 - She's me with indoor plumbing.\\
137 - What are you doing in the ladies' room?\\
138 - The men's room was occupied.\\
139 - Do you have to pee sitting down?\\
140 - - No, the seats go up. - Cool.\\
141 - Hey, it smells nice in here.\\
142 - Hey, Courtney. It's Charlie, your brother.\\
143 - Anyway, I just wanted to apologize for making a scene there in the restaurant.\\
144 - I'd still love to get together, so give me a call.\\
145 - I'm just sitting at home, reading a book.\\
146 - And watching TV.\\
147 - Disney Channel, 101 Dalmatians.\\
148 - What a great film, huh?\\
149 - Sat on the remote.\\
150 - Hey, Apocalypse Now.\\
151 - Another great movie, huh?\\
152 - Anyway, call me.\\
153 - - Hi, Charlie. - Rose?\\
154 - What the hell are you doing here?\\
155 - I could ask you that question.\\
156 - And the answer would be the same: Stalking.\\
157 - - No. No, I'm not... - Good at it?\\
158 - - What do you want? - Right now or long-term?\\
159 - Rose.\\
160 - I've just been watching you for an hour and 38 minutes, and I felt bad for you.\\
161 - I thought maybe you could use some help.\\
162 - Thanks, but I'm fine.\\
163 - Really? Did you bring water?\\
164 - No.\\
165 - Trail mix?\\
166 - No.\\
167 - Pee jar?\\
168 - - That would have been a great idea. - Here you go.\\
169 - - Thank you. - Let's see. What else?\\
170 - Night-vision goggles?\\
171 - - I don't think so. - You say that now...\\
172 - ...but if you hide in her trunk and wanna do a little light reading...\\
173 - ...you're gonna be sorry.\\
174 - - I'm fine. - Okay.\\
175 - I'll just keep you company. Give me one of these...\\
176 - ...if you need to use the pee jar.\\
177 - Charlie, what the hell are you doing?\\
178 - Hey. Teddy. How are you?\\
179 - Since when do you drive a Volvo?\\
180 - It's my brother's car.\\
181 - Very smart. She would have spotted your car.\\
182 - I didn't give you points for that.\\
183 - I thought you and I had an understanding...\\
184 - ...you and my daughter weren't gonna see each other anymore.\\
185 - In my defense, we're not really seeing each other. This is more of a...\\
186 - Reconnaissance mission.\\
187 - Who is this?\\
188 - This is Rose, she's kind of my...\\
189 - Sidekick.\\
190 - I don't wanna beat this to death, but if your mother finds out...\\
191 - ...you and Courtney are seeing each other, and I kept it from her...\\
192 - ...I don't know what she'd do. Probably call off the wedding.\\
193 - I'm sorry, Teddy. I don't want to screw things up.\\
194 - - Well, then, go home. - Right.\\
195 - Nice to meet you, Rose.\\
196 - Boy, if he was 30 years younger, I'd be following him.\\
197 - Oh, what the hell.\\
198 - You were with her, weren't you?\\
199 - What are you, my wife?\\
200 - No, I'm the wedding planner.\\
201 - I'm the one who's dealing with caterers and florists and musicians...\\
202 - ...and parking valets and a thousand frozen butterflies.\\
203 - - Frozen butterflies? - Mom wanted butterflies.\\
204 - What'll she do, eat them?\\
205 - No, you thaw them out during the ceremony...\\
206 - ...and when the bride and groom kiss, they fly away.\\
207 - - Is there still gonna be shrimp? - Yes, there's gonna be shrimp.\\
208 - Good. I like shrimp.\\
209 - Charlie, I will not have you ruin this wedding.\\
210 - Well, you can relax. I wasn't with Courtney.\\
211 - Thank God for that. So where were you?\\
212 - Parked outside her apartment.\\
213 - You were stalking her?\\
214 - Oh, man, why does everybody use that word?\\
215 - - It has such a bad connotation. - Charlie, what is wrong with you?\\
216 - - I've never seen you like this before. - I know, I know.\\
217 - I can't get her out of my mind.\\
218 - I go to sleep thinking about her, I wake up thinking about her.\\
219 - The other day, I stumbled into a three-way...\\
220 - - How do you stumble into a three-way? - It's usually a roommate thing.\\
221 - You read about sisters, but that almost never happens.\\
222 - Anyway, in order to get through it...\\
223 - ...I had to fantasize that both of them were Courtney.\\
224 - - How sad is that? - I'm brokenhearted for you.\\
225 - You know what I think?\\
226 - I think the only reason you're obsessed with Courtney is you can't have her.\\
227 - Well, duh.\\
228 - - Oh, please tell me you're not calling her. - Of course not.\\
229 - Hey, Rose, it's Charlie. Listen, after you're done with Teddy...\\
230 - ...can you swing by Courtney's and let me know what she's doing?\\
231 - Okay, the vows. Now, I understand you've written your own?\\
232 - First I'm hearing about it.\\
233 - Oh, forgive me, darling. I took the liberty of writing both of ours.\\
234 - I come across kind of fruity, don't I?\\
235 - Well, you're in love with me. Love makes everyone a little gay.\\
236 - Terrific.\\
237 - Please let that be my butterflies. Please, please, please.\\
238 - That kid doesn't need butterflies.\\
239 - Hi, Courtney. Come on in.\\
240 - No, that's okay. I just need to talk to my father.\\
241 - - What's up, baby? - Is Courtney here?\\
242 - Hi, Courtney.\\
243 - Hi, Charlie. Dad, it's kind of private. Can I talk to you outside, please?\\
244 - Sure. Excuse me.\\
245 - Did you happen to see a frozen-butterfly truck go by?\\
246 - - Everything okay? - No, no, everything is not okay.\\
247 - Always good to see you.\\
248 - - I don't understand why you won't help. - Damn it, we've been through this.\\
249 - - I'm not gonna keep bailing you out. - But, Daddy...\\
250 - Don't "But, Daddy" me.\\
251 - Sure makes you feel grateful that the three of us get along so well.\\
252 - - Am I supposed to live on the street? - Live within your means.\\
253 - You're just gonna turn your back? Your own daughter?\\
254 - - Oh, don't be such a drama queen. - Forget it, I'm out of here.\\
255 - Courtney, don't be like that.\\
256 - Okay, the butterflies.\\
257 - Now, Mom, when you kiss Teddy, they're gonna be released on the deck.\\
258 - But there's a fifty-fifty chance that gulls will swoop down and rip them to shreds.\\
259 - I'm sorry you heard that.\\
260 - - Do you want me to talk to her? - No, no, leave it alone.\\
261 - I'll go talk to her.\\
262 - Would either of you care to explain why he's going to talk to her?\\
263 - - No. - No.\\
264 - - Hi. - What are you doing here?\\
265 - I was concerned about you. I thought maybe I could help.\\
266 - You can't help me.\\
267 - Try me.\\
268 - I was looking at the wrong window.\\
269 - - What? - Nice place.\\
270 - So, what's going on?\\
271 - What do you want me to tell you, Charlie?\\
272 - I lost my job, I'm about to lose my condo...\\
273 - ...and my father won't lift a finger to help me.\\
274 - How much do you need?\\
275 - Forget it, I can't take your money.\\
276 - Well, I hadn't actually offered yet.\\
277 - But we are gonna be family, and family looks after each other.\\
278 - I need $50,000.\\
279 - How about if I talk to your dad?\\
280 - It's no use.\\
281 - He's trying to teach me a lesson.\\
282 - You know, I just love this place so much.\\
283 - I put every dime I had into it.\\
284 - Charlie, what am I gonna do?\\
285 - You're gonna take the money from me.\\
286 - No.\\
287 - No, it wouldn't be right.\\
288 - I insist.\\
289 - Really?\\
290 - I promise I'll pay you back.\\
291 - I know you will.\\
292 - Thank you.\\
293 - So much.\\
294 - No, no, no, that's not why I'm doing this.\\
295 - I know, I know, but I want you.\\
296 - I want you too...\\
297 - ...but I don't wanna feel like we're doing this because I lent you money.\\
298 - Okay, okay. But soon?\\
299 - Definitely soon.\\
300 - - Good night. - Night.\\
301 - Oh, hell, if you're okay with it, I'm okay with it.\\
302 - "And I promise to honor and cherish you...\\
303 - ...to always be there for you as a trusted friend...\\
304 - ...devoted husband and selfish lover."\\
305 - "Selfless."\\
306 - Oh, right, selfless.\\
307 - "And even though I'm significantly older than you...\\
308 - ...I feel renewed and replenished...\\
309 - ...every time I drink the sweet nectar of your youth."\\
310 - Pick it up, Teddy. No one can see butterflies in the dark.\\
311 - "I remember the first time I laid eyes on you...\\
312 - ...at one of the many charity events to which you so tirelessly devote yourself.\\
313 - You were a vision in Dolce & Gabbana and compassion.\\
314 - And that first moment we spoke, the simple melody of your voice...\\
315 - ...was testimony to how much the world lost...\\
316 - ...when you gave up a very promising singing career...\\
317 - ...in order to raise your two little boys.\\
318 - Not that they ever appreciated it.\\
319 - And the lovemaking...\\
320 - ...what can I say about the lovemaking?"\\
321 - - I can't say this. - Lf you don't, I will.\\
322 - "As I explored every inch of your firm, non-surgically-enhanced body...\\
323 - ...I finally learned the meaning of the words 'heaven on earth'...\\
324 - ...and 'natural redhead.'\\
325 - In the words of the Bard:\\
326 - Shall I compare thee to the summer's day?\\
327 - Thou art more lovely and more temperate.\\
328 - Rough winds do shake The darling buds of May\\
329 - Will you marry me?\\
330 - And summer's lease hath all to short a date.\\
331 - - Really? - Yes.\\
332 - - So long as men can breathe - Yes.\\
333 - - Our eyes can see - Really?\\
334 - So long lives this, and gives life to thee. "\\
335 - You may now kiss the bride.\\
336 - Do you want me to sweep them up and pop them in the microwave?\\
337 - Never mind.\\
338 - Resynced by Ubolena.
\subsection {Episode 17: Fish in a Drawer}
1 - It's hard to believe after all these years, we've got a new stepdad.\\
2 - I give it six months.\\
3 - Come on, we like Teddy.\\
4 - That's why I'm only giving it six months. I'm rooting for him.\\
5 - Still, you have to admit, it was a beautiful ceremony.\\
6 - The bride and groom, the sun setting.\\
7 - The dead butterflies.\\
8 - Remind me to call the butterfly people first thing Monday.\\
9 - What are you doing?\\
10 - Nothing.\\
11 - We don't eat from the cake until we cut the cake.\\
12 - But I'm still hungry.\\
13 - Have some cheese.\\
14 - Have we cut the cheese?\\
15 - Get it?\\
16 - Hey, stepbrother.\\
17 - Change your mind about wanting to marry me?\\
18 - Not at all.\\
19 - Wanna go upstairs and get a head start on our honeymoon?\\
20 - You keep rubbing against me...\\
21 - ...I'll be able to catch my mom's garter without my hands.\\
22 - - Charlie. - What?\\
23 - At your mother's wedding?\\
24 - Yeah.\\
25 - I ain't cleaning it up.\\
26 - Boy, this is pretty kinky.\\
27 - Kinky good or kinky bad?\\
28 - There's a kinky bad?\\
29 - Watch your elbow.\\
30 - That's not my elbow.\\
31 - Charlie.\\
32 - It's not that either.\\
33 - Daddy?\\
34 - This is awkward.\\
35 - Daddy, are you okay?\\
36 - - What's wrong with him? - I don't know.\\
37 - Well?\\
38 - This might be a mood breaker.\\
39 - So are you a friend of the bride or the groom?\\
40 - Well, the bride is my mother, so...\\
41 - The groom.\\
42 - Hey, how do you like my house?\\
43 - Oh, it's beautiful.\\
44 - - Alan, I have to talk to you. - Go away. I've got a shot here.\\
45 - No, you don't.\\
46 - - Come upstairs with me. - Why?\\
47 - Just come on.\\
48 - Be right back.\\
49 - Friend of the bride or friend of the groom?\\
50 - Friend of mine.\\
51 - Oh, my God.\\
52 - Is he...?\\
53 - As a doorknob.\\
54 - - Doorbell? - Doornail.\\
55 - He's dead.\\
56 - I can't believe he's gone.\\
57 - Courtney, I'm so sorry.\\
58 - So he was just lying there with his pants down?\\
59 - Apparently somebody was giving him a very special wedding present.\\
60 - - Mom? - I don't think so.\\
61 - She's downstairs acting as if nothing happened.\\
62 - And more importantly, she married the guy.\\
63 - Why would she bother?\\
64 - Your mother's looking for you guys.\\
65 - What's going on?\\
66 - Teddy's dead.\\
67 - Yeah, that's a stiffy.\\
68 - We have got a real problem here.\\
69 - What do you mean "we"?\\
70 - Oh, this is just gonna suck.\\
71 - Thank you, thank you. Now, this next song you may remember...\\
72 - ...from the hit movie Ghost.\\
73 - Mom?\\
74 - Mom, we gotta talk to you.\\
75 - What?\\
76 - It's about Teddy.\\
77 - Where is he? This is supposed to be a duet.\\
78 - Yeah, well, from now on, I'm afraid you're gonna be working alone.\\
79 - You son of a bitch.\\
80 - So you weren't the one who was...?\\
81 - Of course not. I already married the man.\\
82 - I just can't believe he'd cheat on me on our wedding day.\\
83 - Excuse me, my father is lying here dead.\\
84 - With his pants around his ankles and lipstick on his hoo-hoo.\\
85 - Oh, my, what happened in here?\\
86 - Berta, my husband is dead.\\
87 - As a doornail.\\
88 - Has anybody called the cops?\\
89 - You might wanna consider it...\\
90 - ...because you only got a limited window before he starts stinking up the joint.\\
91 - I'll make the calls.\\
92 - - No, Mom, you don't have to. - Yes, I do.\\
93 - I'm his wife.\\
94 - Now, please, would you all just give me a moment alone with him?\\
95 - - Of course. - Sure, Mom.\\
96 - So who do you suppose was smoking Teddy's sausage?\\
97 - Berta, that is my father in there.\\
98 - Okay.\\
99 - So who do you suppose was smoking your father's sausage?\\
100 - Oh, Teddy.\\
101 - My dear, dear Teddy.\\
102 - Hello.\\
103 - This is Evelyn Harper Leopold.\\
104 - I booked my honeymoon with you.\\
105 - Yes.\\
106 - Two business-class tickets to Paris.\\
107 - I need to exchange them for one first-class ticket to Fiji.\\
108 - Sure, I'll hold.\\
109 - This is a crime scene, so you're just gonna have to be patient.\\
110 - We'll need statements from each of you before you can leave.\\
111 - Anyway, I guess what I'm saying is that there's a lesson to be learned here.\\
112 - Life is precious and no one really knows how long we've got.\\
113 - So it's important to be grateful for each day.\\
114 - So if they're not gonna cut the cake, can I have some now?\\
115 - Aren't you full?\\
116 - No.\\
117 - Take a look at his pants.\\
118 - The belt is buckled on an unworn hole.\\
119 - Someone re-dressed him.\\
120 - Any of you touch the body?\\
121 - Interesting.\\
122 - We've got some peri-mortem ecchymosis on the posterior occiput.\\
123 - That means a bruise on the back of the head.\\
124 - And yet you still couldn't get into medical school.\\
125 - So much for time of death.\\
126 - Looks like our boy here had some sexual activity before he bought it.\\
127 - Hit the light. I'm gonna check for semen.\\
128 - My God.\\
129 - It's like a Jackson Pollock painting.\\
130 - The ceiling fan's actually a cute story.\\
131 - - Coffee? - Thanks.\\
132 - - So Mr. Harper... - Call me Charlie.\\
133 - - And you are? - Interested in how you found the body.\\
134 - Oh, right to it, huh?\\
135 - Okay, well, what have you heard?\\
136 - That's not how we do this.\\
137 - You tell me what happened.\\
138 - All right.\\
139 - I went upstairs to use the bathroom and there he was.\\
140 - Oh, no.\\
141 - Teddy.\\
142 - So you're saying you were alone when you found him?\\
143 - Well, technically aren't we all alone?\\
144 - You know, I'm finding that tank top awfully distracting.\\
145 - Is that police issue?\\
146 - Mr. Harper, are you aware...\\
147 - ...that making a false statement to the police is a crime?\\
148 - Slap-on-the-wrist crime...\\
149 - ...or pack-my-bags-and-tape-my-butt-shut crime?\\
150 - Hey, I like it when it's gift-wrapped.\\
151 - Okay, okay, I wasn't alone. I was with Courtney.\\
152 - - Why'd you lie? - Oh, come on.\\
153 - I was trying to nail my stepsister at my mother's wedding.\\
154 - Lying seemed the classy way to go.\\
155 - Did you touch the body?\\
156 - I was all over her body.\\
157 - Oh, you mean Teddy?\\
158 - No, no, no. Not after I knew he was there.\\
159 - Who do you suppose pulled up his pants?\\
160 - Are you thinking whoever pulled them up is the one who killed him?\\
161 - It's crossed our minds.\\
162 - Oh, gee, I don't wanna implicate anybody.\\
163 - Right now, the only one implicated is you.\\
164 - Talk to my mother.\\
165 - What is that? Nondairy creamer?\\
166 - Just take me to the green mile and be done with it.\\
167 - That's all we've got.\\
168 - Please, this place is crawling with cops. One of them can't make a Starbucks run?\\
169 - - Mrs. Harper... - Mrs. Leopold.\\
170 - Mrs. Leopold.\\
171 - Did you touch your husband's body before the police arrived?\\
172 - All right, yes, I pulled up his pants.\\
173 - - Why? - Because it was embarrassing.\\
174 - There was lipstick on his hoo-hoo.\\
175 - - Your lipstick? - Oh, God, no.\\
176 - I'd rather drink your coffee.\\
177 - So he was with another woman?\\
178 - Not necessarily.\\
179 - Do you have another theory for where the lipstick came from?\\
180 - Have you ruled out clowns?\\
181 - You should check for really big footprints.\\
182 - Okay, he was with another woman.\\
183 - - I imagine that made you pretty angry. - I don't get angry. I get even.\\
184 - I mean, what are you insinuating?\\
185 - I'm insinuating that maybe you caught him in the act.\\
186 - - Evie. - You cheating bastard.\\
187 - Evie, I can explain.\\
188 - Evie, I can explain.\\
189 - I can explain.\\
190 - And Paris for two becomes Fiji for one.\\
191 - We checked your phone records.\\
192 - Listen, let me tell you something.\\
193 - I loved that man and he loved me.\\
194 - In fact, he loved me so much, he didn't even ask for a prenup.\\
195 - And believe me, he's got money. Big money.\\
196 - Well, we don't have to look very hard to find a motive for you, do we?\\
197 - I'm warning you, coffee tends to shoot through me.\\
198 - So if you've got a cavity search planned, you better do it pretty quick.\\
199 - We don't need to do a cavity search.\\
200 - Can I request one?\\
201 - What do you know about Teddy Leopold?\\
202 - I know he was hot for me.\\
203 - He was always flirting.\\
204 - Berta, this is mom's boyfriend, Teddy. Teddy, my housekeeper Berta.\\
205 - - A pleasure. - It could be if you play your cards right.\\
206 - You can't blame him.\\
207 - You gotta figure that boinking Evelyn is like riding a bicycle over train tracks.\\
208 - You'll get where you're going, but you're gonna feel every bump.\\
209 - - How's the hot chocolate? - Good. I like the powdered stuff...\\
210 - ...because there's always something to chew on when you get to the bottom.\\
211 - - You got any donuts? - Nope.\\
212 - - Danish? - Nope.\\
213 - Pie?\\
214 - Look, Jake, what I wanna know is...\\
215 - ...were you in your uncle's room at any time today?\\
216 - - No, I never go in my uncle's room. - Why not?\\
217 - Because all the skin mags are in my dad's room.\\
218 - Okay, let me just start out by saying I know about the illegal left-turn ticket.\\
219 - And I've been meaning to take care of it...\\
220 - ...but, you know, business has been slow, and bills just keep coming.\\
221 - Of course I don't have to tell you that.\\
222 - Our law enforcement personnel are underpaid.\\
223 - Thank you for the coffee, by the way.\\
224 - Cops and truck drivers, you know your coffee. Am I going to jail?\\
225 - Tell me about you and Teddy Leopold.\\
226 - Oh, I loved Teddy. He was like a father to me.\\
227 - - Is that so? - Yeah, yeah.\\
228 - He took me to Vegas, brought me a hooker.\\
229 - Would any of you gentlemen like a date?\\
230 - Sorry, doll, I'm taken.\\
231 - But I wouldn't mind footing the bill for my two boys here.\\
232 - Hi, I'm Amber.\\
233 - I'm Tiffany.\\
234 - - Thanks, Daddy. - Thanks, Daddy.\\
235 - A hooker?\\
236 - And gelato.\\
237 - - You got my blessing, Teddy. - Shut up and eat your gelato.\\
238 - So you were happy he married your mother?\\
239 - Are you kidding? I was thrilled.\\
240 - I planned the wedding. And it went great.\\
241 - The reception not so much.\\
242 - Why, what happened?\\
243 - The groom died.\\
244 - Remember?\\
245 - Do you need to write that down?\\
246 - Any idea who might have wanted him dead?\\
247 - No, no, everybody loved Teddy.\\
248 - And he was so good to my mom.\\
249 - It's a shame she has to bury another husband.\\
250 - Another husband?\\
251 - Yeah, well, she's, you know, had a bit of bad luck...\\
252 - ...in the dead spouse department.\\
253 - Not that you can have good luck in the dead spouse department.\\
254 - Can I have some more coffee?\\
255 - Who ratted me out? Was it Alan?\\
256 - Oh, it doesn't matter.\\
257 - Either one of them would throw me under a bus for an Eskimo Pie.\\
258 - We'd just like to know about your late husbands.\\
259 - All right. There's not much to tell.\\
260 - Charlie and Alan's father died of food poisoning.\\
261 - Where'd he get the food?\\
262 - I was a young bride. I was just learning to cook.\\
263 - And nobody told me you don't keep fish in a drawer.\\
264 - All right, what about the others?\\
265 - Oh, the usual.\\
266 - Couple of heart attacks, a bathtub electrocution.\\
267 - Why are you grilling me?\\
268 - I'm not the one who was fighting with him over money.\\
269 - Who was?\\
270 - I don't understand why you won't help.\\
271 - We've been through this. I'm not gonna keep bailing you out.\\
272 - - But, Daddy, l... - Don't "But Daddy" me.\\
273 - What am I to do? Live on the street?\\
274 - You're supposed to live within your means.\\
275 - I want a lawyer.\\
276 - Tall soy latte, no foam.\\
277 - Grandmommy can't drink this cop swill anymore.\\
278 - - Mom, they told us to wait here. - Well, that's why I'm sending Jake.\\
279 - Think of it as job training, dear.\\
280 - Hi, Charlie.\\
281 - Hey, Charlie.\\
282 - Hi, Charlie.\\
283 - Hi, Alan.\\
284 - I'm not the one who's got a husband...\\
285 - ...with someone else's lipstick on his dipstick.\\
286 - Has anybody seen Courtney?\\
287 - She's talking to her attorney.\\
288 - Why does she need an attorney?\\
289 - GC mass spec analysis revealed that the lipstick pigment on the body...\\
290 - ...matches lipstick she was wearing. - Wait.\\
291 - - Courtney with her own father? - Not according to their DNA.\\
292 - - They're not even related. - What?\\
293 - - You're kidding. - They're con artists, grifters.\\
294 - Wanted in half a dozen states.\\
295 - His real name is Nathan Krunk and she is Sylvia Fishman.\\
296 - That can't be right.\\
297 - I was gonna marry her.\\
298 - - What? - What?\\
299 - We were gonna surprise you, but I guess that ship has sailed.\\
300 - They've got a record of marital fraud.\\
301 - They pick out marks with more money than brains...\\
302 - ...and then take them down the aisle.\\
303 - You're just gonna turn your back on me?\\
304 - - Don't be such a drama queen. - You know what, forget it.\\
305 - - I'm out of here. - Courtney, don't be like that.\\
306 - But I don't understand.\\
307 - Teddy didn't need money. He was a very wealthy man.\\
308 - And I practically had to force Courtney to take my $50,000.\\
309 - But what about his lifestyle?\\
310 - The private jet, the trips to Vegas?\\
311 - Bad checks, stolen credit cards.\\
312 - The reason he didn't want a prenup is so he could get your money.\\
313 - But then why would Courtney kill her own partner?\\
314 - She didn't.\\
315 - They were going at it hot and heavy and his heart gave out.\\
316 - Yeah, I can see that happening.\\
317 - What threw us off at first was the bruising on the back of his head.\\
318 - Then autopsy revealed that had happened roughly 48 hours...\\
319 - ...before time of death.\\
320 - Still up to get together, so give me a call.\\
321 - I'm just sitting at home, reading a book.\\
322 - That hurts.\\
323 - Wanna switch?\\
324 - Yeah, let's try banging your head for a while.\\
325 - I don't believe it.\\
326 - She used me, she scammed me, she took my money.\\
327 - - Courtney. - What?\\
328 - I'll wait for you.\\
329 - Got a postcard from the black widow.\\
330 - No kidding.\\
331 - - How's her honeymoon going? - Pretty good apparently.\\
332 - She's already met a wealthy real-estate investor.\\
333 - I gotta admit, the woman's got spirit.\\
334 - No matter what life throws at her, she always lands on her back.\\
335 - What's the matter?\\
336 - - Oh, Jake. - Oh, God.\\
337 - That was a good one, wasn't it?\\
338 - Resynced by Ubolena.
\subsection {Episode 18: If My Hole Could Talk}
1 - Got your homework done?\\
2 - - All of it? - Yep.\\
3 - Attaboy. You just get to kick back this weekend.\\
4 - That's my plan.\\
5 - Except...?\\
6 - Except nothing.\\
7 - Well, excuse me.\\
8 - - Oh, yeah. - There it is.\\
9 - I might have to write a book report for Monday.\\
10 - What do you mean you might have to?\\
11 - If there's no earthquake by Monday morning...\\
12 - ...I have to write a book report.\\
13 - Oh, God. So, what's the book?\\
14 - William Shakespeare's The Taming Of The Shrew.\\
15 - By William Shakespeare.\\
16 - That'll come in handy when he's mopping out the toilets at the House of Pancakes.\\
17 - You know, I could go for some pancakes.\\
18 - Jake, please tell me you read the book.\\
19 - I really wish I could, Dad.\\
20 - I was gonna read it, but I can't find it.\\
21 - You lost the book?\\
22 - What do you intend to do about the report?\\
23 - You mean aside from the earthquake?\\
24 - Yeah.\\
25 - Well, I kind of put all my eggs in the earthquake basket.\\
26 - Get dressed. We're going to the store.\\
27 - - Well, can we stop for pancakes? - Go.\\
28 - I bet you're sorry you took all that LSD before you had him.\\
29 - I never took any LSD.\\
30 - You might wanna start telling people you did.\\
31 - Unbelievable. You had four weeks to write this book report.\\
32 - Get over it, Dad.\\
33 - Yeah, Alan. Relax.\\
34 - He'll have eight weeks of summer school to do it.\\
35 - Unless there's an earthquake.\\
36 - Excuse me, could you tell me where the classic literature section is?\\
37 - - Third floor near the restroom. - Thank you.\\
38 - Go ahead. I'm gonna look at magazines.\\
39 - They don't sell those kinds of magazines here. I checked.\\
40 - Come on, you little perv. Meet me back here.\\
41 - Wait, was that an earthquake?\\
42 - Can I help you find anything?\\
43 - Yeah, I'm looking for a book.\\
44 - You probably need more than that.\\
45 - I want a book about, you know, relationship stuff.\\
46 - Relationship stuff.\\
47 - No, not "relationship stuff," just relationship stuff.\\
48 - In the self-help section.\\
49 - - Thanks. - Best of luck.\\
50 - This is worse than buying condoms.\\
51 - Okay, let's see.\\
52 - "Why Relationships Fail."\\
53 - "Smart Women, Foolish Choices."\\
54 - Thank God for those gals.\\
55 - - Excuse me. - Sorry.\\
56 - Oh, "Embracing Your Soul Mate."\\
57 - Oh, "soul mate." I thought it was "cellmate."\\
58 - You know, a prison love story?\\
59 - I see.\\
60 - Not that I'm into prison love stories.\\
61 - I like the girls-in-prison stuff.\\
62 - Oh, who am I kidding?\\
63 - I'm looking for some help, okay?\\
64 - You're not alone. There are millions of people looking for help.\\
65 - Gee, thanks for making me feel special.\\
66 - Let me ask you something.\\
67 - What would you change about yourself if you could?\\
68 - - I don't know, little things, I guess. - Like what?\\
69 - Well, I guess I'd like to be a little happier.\\
70 - Maybe find a way to sustain a healthy relationship with a woman...\\
71 - ...so I don't, you know, grow old and die alone...\\
72 - ...incontinent and unloved.\\
73 - Yes, the little things.\\
74 - Can I recommend a book for you?\\
75 - Well, as long as I'm here.\\
76 - "Breaking Barriers: Finding The Intimacy You Deserve."\\
77 - I don't know. I was hoping to do better than I deserve.\\
78 - Give it a chance. I hear it's helped a lot of people.\\
79 - For 25 bucks, it better wash my car.\\
80 - Wait a minute, is this you?\\
81 - Armor All's extra.\\
82 - - Cool. Will you sign it for me? - Oh, I'd be happy to. What's your name?\\
83 - - Charlie. - Okay.\\
84 - Great.\\
85 - Now, that it's autographed, I'm not a loser, I'm a collector.\\
86 - Here you go.\\
87 - "To Charlie, reading a self-help book doesn't make you less of a man."\\
88 - Okay, back to loser.\\
89 - You're not a loser.\\
90 - Like most men, you're just afraid to be vulnerable.\\
91 - Excuse me, but what sane person wants to be vulnerable?\\
92 - If you're not vulnerable, you can't feel anything.\\
93 - Yeah, and?\\
94 - Read the book.\\
95 - Wait.\\
96 - Can I buy you a cup of coffee?\\
97 - - Why? - I'd like to talk to you some more.\\
98 - Are you still gonna buy the book?\\
99 - I have to. You wrote all over it.\\
100 - - Then sure, why not? - Great.\\
101 - If I give you the money, will you pay for it?\\
102 - I don't need any more sympathy from the help.\\
103 - What's a shrew anyway?\\
104 - Oh, it's a small rodent.\\
105 - Oh, so this is like Stuart Little?\\
106 - No, no, it's about a man trying to control a willful, angry woman.\\
107 - Is he trying to control her with rodents?\\
108 - I don't wanna spoil it for you.\\
109 - Let's just find your Uncle Charlie and get out of here.\\
110 - Excuse me, have you seen a guy, dark hair, bowling shirt, shorts?\\
111 - Oh, yeah, the self-help guy.\\
112 - No, that doesn't sound like him.\\
113 - A guy like that just left with a pretty blond woman.\\
114 - That sounds like him.\\
115 - Dad, this is the wrong book.\\
116 - - What are you talking about? - It's in some sort of foreign language.\\
117 - It's Elizabethan.\\
118 - Well, can we get one in English?\\
119 - Walk.\\
120 - How could you have already lost the book?\\
121 - I didn't do it on purpose. What are you yelling at me for?\\
122 - Because it's one of the few pleasures of being your father.\\
123 - - Oh, look who's here. Thanks a lot. - What did I do?\\
124 - You stranded us at the mall. We had to take the bus.\\
125 - The bus, I left the book on the bus. There, mystery solved.\\
126 - Go get in the car.\\
127 - - Where are we going? - Where do you think we're going?\\
128 - Well, we never did get those pancakes.\\
129 - We're going to the bookstore to buy another book.\\
130 - - This one's coming out of your allowance. - What allowance?\\
131 - - I'm supposed to be getting an allowance? - Go get your shoes.\\
132 - - Did you guys feel that? - Move it.\\
133 - So guess what.\\
134 - I'm gonna transform my life and get the intimacy I deserve.\\
135 - Fantastic.\\
136 - You work on that while I go back to the mall with taterhead.\\
137 - Not only that, I met the author and she's amazing.\\
138 - - The woman you dumped us for? - Yeah, know what she told me?\\
139 - No idea.\\
140 - She told me that my fear of being hurt keeps me from feeling anything at all.\\
141 - It's like I'm living in an emotional prison that I built myself.\\
142 - How about that? You abandoned us.\\
143 - I know, but get this.\\
144 - I'm not just a prisoner, I'm the warden.\\
145 - We had to take two buses and walk a mile on the Pacific Coast Highway...\\
146 - ...during rush hour.\\
147 - I get it. I understand.\\
148 - But the good news is I hold the keys to my own freedom.\\
149 - There's no sidewalk on the Pacific Coast highway.\\
150 - Okay, okay, I hear you.\\
151 - You're angry and resentful.\\
152 - But what you need to understand...\\
153 - ...is that resentment is the mortar that holds the bricks of Ioneliness together...\\
154 - ...in a wall of alienation and despair.\\
155 - Chapter 3, "Knocking Down the Wall."\\
156 - Bite me.\\
157 - That's Chapter 1 in my forthcoming book entitled Bite Me.\\
158 - Chapter 2 is called, "Kiss My Pale White Ass."\\
159 - - We can't go back to the mall. - Why not?\\
160 - My shoes are missing.\\
161 - Another mystery solved.\\
162 - Wrong foot, buddy.\\
163 - Oh, yeah, thanks.\\
164 - Guess I should be reading Taming of the Shoe.\\
165 - Get it?\\
166 - You might wanna start thinking about having him neutered.\\
167 - This is delicious.\\
168 - I've never had Ethiopian food before.\\
169 - I've loved it ever since I lived in Ethiopia.\\
170 - When did you live there?\\
171 - Let's see.\\
172 - It would have to be 1972.\\
173 - 1972? Were you born there?\\
174 - Don't be silly. This was right after college. I was in the Peace Corps.\\
175 - College, 1972.\\
176 - Need a pencil?\\
177 - No, no, no.\\
178 - I was just thinking what I was doing in 1972.\\
179 - Oh, tell me.\\
180 - I don't have a vivid memory of it...\\
181 - ...but I'm sure that's the year I graduated to the big-boy potty.\\
182 - It was quite a year for both of us.\\
183 - So are you still using that college degree?\\
184 - Because I'm still using the big-boy potty.\\
185 - You're used to going out with younger women, aren't you?\\
186 - Well, I don't really think about age as much as I think about personality...\\
187 - ...and, you know, chemistry and education, family values.\\
188 - All right, young and dumb, you got me.\\
189 - I'm not judging you, Charlie. You're a man and you know what you want.\\
190 - What's wrong with that?\\
191 - Nothing?\\
192 - Nothing.\\
193 - You are fine just the way you are.\\
194 - - I am? - Of course, you are.\\
195 - If I called my mother now, would you tell her that?\\
196 - You don't think she knows?\\
197 - As far as she's concerned...\\
198 - ...the last thing I did right was evacuate her uterus.\\
199 - Oh, you poor thing. That's awful.\\
200 - It is, isn't it?\\
201 - Every little boy needs to feel loved and nurtured.\\
202 - Otherwise, he grows up with a hole inside him that he can never fill.\\
203 - Oh, I have got such a big hole.\\
204 - If my hole could talk.\\
205 - You've got a little something right here.\\
206 - I'll get it.\\
207 - - There we go. - Thanks.\\
208 - You know what?\\
209 - I like you.\\
210 - Well, I like you too, Charlie.\\
211 - Try the Yemiser Kik Wat.\\
212 - Looks kind of yucky.\\
213 - Well, don't look at it. Just taste it.\\
214 - Oh, come on, just one bite. For me?\\
215 - Okay.\\
216 - Hey, it's good.\\
217 - I told you.\\
218 - Oh, excuse me. Could I get another napkin?\\
219 - So, what do they have for dessert?\\
220 - Well, Charlie, thank you for a lovely evening.\\
221 - You're welcome.\\
222 - Can I kiss you good night?\\
223 - Do you usually ask permission?\\
224 - Well, no.\\
225 - Then why are you asking now?\\
226 - I don't know. I don't wanna get in trouble.\\
227 - Okay, I'm in trouble.\\
228 - Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I heard something.\\
229 - It's okay. Jeremy, this is Charlie.\\
230 - - Charlie, this is my son, Jeremy. - Hey, man.\\
231 - - How are you? - How's it going?\\
232 - I didn't mean to interrupt. I dropped in to fix your computer.\\
233 - I'll leave you two alone. Charlie, good meeting you.\\
234 - Same here.\\
235 - So that's your son?\\
236 - - How old is he? - Thirty-two.\\
237 - They're cute at that age.\\
238 - - Hey. - What?\\
239 - You're supposed to be finishing your report.\\
240 - I know, but I can't find the book.\\
241 - You're kidding. We just bought it.\\
242 - What can I say, Dad?\\
243 - It's a big house and a little book.\\
244 - Find the book.\\
245 - - I'm really tired. - Find the book.\\
246 - Just saying it won't make it happen.\\
247 - Find the book!\\
248 - Heads up. He's losing it.\\
249 - I should have put frosting on the damn book.\\
250 - He's never lost anything with frosting on it.\\
251 - I don't know why you continue to bang your head against the wall.\\
252 - The kid's obviously destined to sell tube socks out of the trunk of his car.\\
253 - A business of his own.\\
254 - Gee, that'd be swell.\\
255 - - So how was your date? - Terrific.\\
256 - - Then why are you home so early? - Well, turns out she has a kid.\\
257 - Single mom, huh?\\
258 - Yeah.\\
259 - That's what she is, single mom.\\
260 - - How old? - Thirty-two.\\
261 - - I meant the kid. - So did I.\\
262 - You're kidding.\\
263 - If she's got a 32-year-old kid that would make her...\\
264 - Don't do the math, please.\\
265 - It all goes south when you do the math.\\
266 - Come on, so you're dating an older woman. It's no big deal.\\
267 - That's it? You're not gonna give me a hard time?\\
268 - Don't be silly. I'm more evolved than that.\\
269 - Well, good.\\
270 - Just a gigolo Everywhere I go\\
271 - People know the part I'm playing\\
272 - I guess I'm not.\\
273 - Look, this is a spectacular woman...\\
274 - ...and it doesn't matter in the least how old she is.\\
275 - Please. You can't even tolerate age spots on a banana.\\
276 - Okay, okay, first of all, on a banana, spots are an indication of mushiness.\\
277 - And second, I haven't peeled this woman yet.\\
278 - In the freezer?\\
279 - - Jake. - I found it, I'm reading.\\
280 - It's really cool.\\
281 - - For God's sake. - Hey, I was reading that.\\
282 - You're writing a report on The Taming of The Shrew...\\
283 - ...not the voyages of Cap'n Crunch.\\
284 - Too bad. I could write the crap out of that.\\
285 - Okay, I'm not fooling around here.\\
286 - You're gonna finish this damn book and write the damn report...\\
287 - ...you're gonna hand it in Monday, spell-checked...\\
288 - ...formatted and on freaking time.\\
289 - I have my doubts, Dad.\\
290 - - Read. - Fine.\\
291 - Listen to this.\\
292 - "A sleeve? 'Tis like a demi-cannon:\\
293 - What! Up and down, carv'd like an apple-tart?"\\
294 - All I get from this is "blah, blah, blah, apple tart."\\
295 - Have we got any apple tarts?\\
296 - - Hi. - Hi.\\
297 - Good.\\
298 - I was afraid that first kiss might have been a fluke.\\
299 - Well, I don't know about you, but that was not my first kiss.\\
300 - Come on in.\\
301 - Wow, what a beautiful home.\\
302 - Thank you.\\
303 - How much of it do you wanna see?\\
304 - This'll be enough for today.\\
305 - Understood. Let's hit the road.\\
306 - Aren't you gonna take a jacket?\\
307 - I'm okay, don't need one.\\
308 - - It gets cool in Santa Barbara, Charlie. - I'll be fine.\\
309 - Please. If you don't need it, you can leave it in the car.\\
310 - All right.\\
311 - - Take a look around. - Thanks, I will.\\
312 - Oh, hi, you must be Angie.\\
313 - I'm Alan, Charlie's brother.\\
314 - Oh, of course, hi. Oh, what a firm handshake.\\
315 - Oh, well, no one trusts a chiropractor with limp hands.\\
316 - Oh, you're a chiropractor?\\
317 - Hang on. I could have gotten into medical school.\\
318 - I didn't wanna spend four years in South America.\\
319 - - No, no, I'm a big fan of chiropractics. - You're kidding.\\
320 - No, I think you people are miracle workers.\\
321 - Okay, I'm ready to go.\\
322 - Did you put on sun block?\\
323 - I don't need sun block.\\
324 - Oh, honey, I think you do.\\
325 - You have beautiful skin. I don't wanna see it get burned.\\
326 - You're right, thanks.\\
327 - So anyway, you were saying something about me being a miracle worker?\\
328 - Oh, God, yes. I threw my back out last year skiing.\\
329 - - My chiropractor just about saved my life. - That's what we do, you know.\\
330 - We're not flashy, we don't get, you know, special license plates...\\
331 - ...so we can park wherever the hell we want.\\
332 - You know, nobody makes TV shows about us.\\
333 - Or calls us McDreamy or McSteamy or McMuffin.\\
334 - We just quietly go about the business of healing.\\
335 - - I know, I know. - Thank you, thank you.\\
336 - I only wish more people appreciated us.\\
337 - You can't worry about what people think.\\
338 - I know, but the lack of respect really hurts, you know.\\
339 - Back-cracker, spine-cruncher, quack, charlatan, witch doctor...\\
340 - - Alan. ...voodoo priest, fraud, failure.\\
341 - Hey, hey.\\
342 - Know what we call people who say those things?\\
343 - My family?\\
344 - We call them damaged.\\
345 - They need to hurt others to feel better about themselves.\\
346 - Exactly, the reason I don't feel better about myself...\\
347 - ...is I'm not good enough at hurting them back.\\
348 - Oh, no, you don't wanna do that.\\
349 - Yeah, I kind of do.\\
350 - Alan, you need to ignore the negativity and open yourself up...\\
351 - ...to the nurturing love that's all around you.\\
352 - - Love is all around me? - Yes.\\
353 - Is it hiding behind the loathing and rejection?\\
354 - Honey, I am loving you right now.\\
355 - - Really? - Yes, really.\\
356 - Thank you.\\
357 - You are a wonderful, valuable human being.\\
358 - I am?\\
359 - Yes, you are.\\
360 - I see you're getting to know my brother.\\
361 - Isn't this beautiful country?\\
362 - Yeah, it's swell.\\
363 - Angie, if you like antiquing, I know some great little shops.\\
364 - - I'm not going antiquing. - Oh, that's okay.\\
365 - Angie and I will peel off and you can sit in the park and drink.\\
366 - Are there any game arcades in Santa Barbara?\\
367 - You won't have time. You have a book to read.\\
368 - Oh, yeah.\\
369 - I forgot it.\\
370 - That's okay. We can stop at a bookstore.\\
371 - Oh, gee, we don't want to ruin your afternoon.\\
372 - Hey, we invited you. We want you with us.\\
373 - - Right, Charlie? - No.\\
374 - Oh, don't be that way.\\
375 - I tell you what, after we get Jake's book, we'll stop and get ice cream.\\

\subsection {Episode 19: Waiting for the Right Snapper}
1 - Thanks for seeing me on such short notice, doc.\\
2 - Not a problem, Charlie. So, what's the big emergency?\\
3 - Why does it have to be an emergency? I wanted to check in.\\
4 - Well, you left six messages on my service.\\
5 - Oh, that was just a liquored up fella hitting the speed dial.\\
6 - I got five minutes before my next patient.\\
7 - Why don't you just give me the headlines?\\
8 - All right, I'm seeing a woman.\\
9 - That's not a headline, that's the name of the paper.\\
10 - I know, I know, but she's different from the type of woman I usually go out with.\\
11 - - Yeah? Different how? - Well, she's a little older.\\
12 - Well, you really couldn't go younger...\\
13 - ...without having to register with the authorities.\\
14 - - I mean, she's older than me. - Oh, we have our headline.\\
15 - And I'm confused because I have really strong feelings towards her.\\
16 - - Do you find her attractive? - She's gorgeous.\\
17 - - How's the sex? - We haven't had sex yet.\\
18 - Hold the presses, we have a new headline.\\
19 - - Do I have to pay extra for the sarcasm? - No, it's a flat rate.\\
20 - The thing is, we get along great.\\
21 - She's warm, nurturing, supportive. And I feel really safe with her.\\
22 - Well, let's see, you're involved with an older woman...\\
23 - ...who's warm, nurturing and supportive.\\
24 - You feel very safe with her, and you haven't had sex.\\
25 - Now, what male-female relationship does that suggest?\\
26 - I feel like I should know this one.\\
27 - Take your time.\\
28 - Older, nurturing, warm...\\
29 - Mrs. Butterworth?\\
30 - Charlie, this woman you're seeing is a mother figure.\\
31 - A mother figure? I said she's warm, nurturing and supportive.\\
32 - The words toxic she-devil did not pass my lips.\\
33 - My point is, because your real mother didn't give you...\\
34 - ...what you need emotionally, you're responding to it in this relationship.\\
35 - No, no, no. This is not a mother thing.\\
36 - Now, my brother Alan, he's the needy one.\\
37 - He practically wants to sit in this woman's lap and breastfeed.\\
38 - And not in a fun way.\\
39 - - So Alan's met her? - Yeah.\\
40 - And he's clinging to her like a tree monkey, which is really pissing me off.\\
41 - So you're competing with your brother for the attention...\\
42 - ...of an older, nurturing woman?\\
43 - Boy, you're just a one-string banjo, aren't you?\\
44 - What do you want me to tell you? I play the notes in front of me.\\
45 - I want you to cut all the psychobabble and tell me why I'm so confused.\\
46 - I just did.\\
47 - You're gonna stick with the mother thing?\\
48 - Look, Charlie, I've got my next patient waiting.\\
49 - If you like, we can make a weekly appointment and explore these issues.\\
50 - In fact, twice a week might not be overdoing it.\\
51 - No, thanks. I deal with my demons as they escape.\\
52 - All right.\\
53 - So, what do I owe you?\\
54 - Well, I get $200 an hour. You were here for five minutes.\\
55 - So why don't we just round it off and say $200?\\
56 - Man. Even hookers prorate.\\
57 - Hookers don't have to listen to you, Charlie. Goodbye.\\
58 - Bye, doc. Good session.\\
59 - - Hi, come on in. - Thanks for seeing me last minute.\\
60 - I think I'm in love with my brother's girlfriend.\\
61 - - Hi. - Hi, yourself.\\
62 - - Oh, don't you look handsome? - Nah.\\
63 - Yes, you do.\\
64 - - And that shirt looks great on you. - You think?\\
65 - - Oh, yes. Very grown-up. - Well, you bought it for me.\\
66 - But you should tuck it in, sweetie.\\
67 - I don't wanna.\\
68 - - Please? - Oh, all right.\\
69 - - Are you ready to go? - I just need a minute, come on in.\\
70 - - You remember my son, Jeremy. - Oh, sure.\\
71 - - How's it going? - Hi, good.\\
72 - - Good. - Good to see you.\\
73 - And this is his fianc e, Tricia.\\
74 - Hi, Tricia. Charlie.\\
75 - Hi, Charlie. Nice to meet you.\\
76 - - Mom's helping us plan our wedding. - Really?\\
77 - - Yeah. - You're getting married? Lucky guy.\\
78 - Not that I'd know. I'm just assuming.\\
79 - - I'm just gonna get my purse. - Hurry back. Hop, hop, hop.\\
80 - So you're getting married.\\
81 - - Taking the plunge. - Yeah.\\
82 - I've never stuck a toe in myself.\\
83 - Actually, I've never stuck anything in.\\
84 - Anyway, it's a big step.\\
85 - Not for me. Tricia's the love of my life.\\
86 - And I can't believe nobody snapped her up before I did.\\
87 - Well, maybe she was just waiting for the right snapper.\\
88 - I mean, the past isn't nearly as important...\\
89 - ...as the future you two are gonna build together, am I right?\\
90 - - Absolutely. The past doesn't matter. - That's what I'm thinking.\\
91 - Okay, let's go.\\
92 - Okay, nice seeing you again. Nice meeting you, bye.\\
93 - Isn't she terrific? I am so happy...\\
94 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's a catch, let's go.\\
95 - Why aren't you studying for your Algebra final?\\
96 - Because I don't have to.\\
97 - - You don't have to study Algebra? - Nope.\\
98 - All I gotta do is get a 67 to pass the course.\\
99 - Then it's adios seventh grade, arrivederci eighth.\\
100 - Okay, we can cross UN interpreter off the job list.\\
101 - But let's get back to the Algebra test. So you're planning on getting a 67?\\
102 - Yep. Anything above that would just be wasted effort.\\
103 - Okay, we have to talk.\\
104 - Hey, the blind, one-armed dancer's about to go on.\\
105 - - This is more important. - Last week, she fell twice.\\
106 - Listen to me.\\
107 - You know what you call someone who just skates through life...\\
108 - ...doing only the bare minimum?\\
109 - Uncle Charlie?\\
110 - You call him a slacker.\\
111 - - Whatev. - Whatev?\\
112 - Are you now so lazy you can't even be bothered to finish words?\\
113 - What's your prob? Won't you be happy if I just get into eighth grade?\\
114 - I mean, isn't that the whole point of seventh?\\
115 - No, that is not the whole point of seventh.\\
116 - And yes, I'll be thrilled if you're not left back.\\
117 - So relax, it's all good.\\
118 - Don't you mean it's all goo?\\
119 - Holy crap, her arm flew off.\\
120 - That's gotta cost some points.\\
121 - Two adults for the Wings of Love.\\
122 - - No, wait. I get a senior discount. - No, you don't. Full price, both of us.\\
123 - Charlie, you're being silly.\\
124 - For 2 bucks, let me be silly.\\
125 - Hey, Charlie.\\
126 - Perfect.\\
127 - We're at the same theater. What a happy coincidence.\\
128 - Yeah, just like Booth and Lincoln.\\
129 - Angie, this is my mother, Evelyn. Mom, this is Angie.\\
130 - Nice to meet you, Evelyn, I've heard a lot about you.\\
131 - Well, there's two sides to every story.\\
132 - And Charlie's memory isn't the best. You know:\\
133 - And considering how you raised me, it was either... or:\\
134 - Charlie, don't be so sensitive.\\
135 - Have you met his brother? Another drama queen.\\
136 - Okay, Mom. Always great bumping into you.\\
137 - Maybe next time you'll be standing in front of a wood chipper.\\
138 - - Enjoy the movie. - Bye-bye.\\
139 - - Hey, Charlie? - Oh, swell. There's more.\\
140 - I'll meet you inside.\\
141 - Yes?\\
142 - - Be careful, that woman is a cougar. - A what?\\
143 - An older woman who preys on young men.\\
144 - - That's not what this is about. - Right, she likes you for your brains.\\
145 - And I love you for your warmth.\\
146 - Nice yanking chains with you, Mom.\\
147 - What did I do to deserve that?\\
148 - - Here are your keys, Evelyn. - Thanks, Justin.\\
149 - So, what movie should we see?\\
150 - Oh, you pick, darling. You're the one who'll be facing the screen.\\
151 - Okay, X is minus four?\\
152 - Great. You're right. See? See? You can do this.\\
153 - On the test, you have to show your work.\\
154 - So let's see your work.\\
155 - There's no work.\\
156 - Why is there no work?\\
157 - I don't need to do the work. Suddenly, I can see all the numbers in my head.\\
158 - - Really? - Yeah, it's amazing.\\
159 - And they all make perfect sense.\\
160 - It's like the equations are solving themselves before my eyes.\\
161 - Oh, my God, you know, I've read about that kind of thing...\\
162 - ...but my own son?\\
163 - No, I'm just screwing with you.\\
164 - The answers are in the back of the book.\\
165 - Good night.\\
166 - You should have seen your face when you thought I was smart.\\
167 - Am I supposed to go to bed now?\\
168 - Dad?\\
169 - I still love him. I still love him. I still love him. I still love...\\
170 - - You're only punishing yourself. Let it go. - Easy for you to say.\\
171 - Your mom wasn't four rows behind you in a movie theater...\\
172 - ...dry-humping a Cub Scout.\\
173 - Oh, hey. I didn't hear you guys come in.\\
174 - - How did you like Wings of Love? - Oh, it was terrific.\\
175 - I thought you'd enjoy the movie.\\
176 - It's the same cinematographer as Like Water for Chocolate.\\
177 - - Yes. Would you like some wine? - I'd love some.\\
178 - Here's 10 bucks. Go get yourself a bottle.\\
179 - Gee, thanks, but I can't go out now.\\
180 - I just put my little boy to bed.\\
181 - You got a little boy? Aren't you afraid Jake will eat him?\\
182 - How do you like being a father, Alan?\\
183 - Well, you know, I'd have to say that it's wonderfully rewarding.\\
184 - And more than a little challenging. Jake's kind of a diamond in the rough.\\
185 - Jake's kind of a turd in the punch bowl.\\
186 - Charlie, that is no way to talk about a child.\\
187 - He's not a child.\\
188 - He's a post-pubescent tapeworm with a bad haircut.\\
189 - Charlie.\\
190 - - Was your divorce very hard on him? - You have no idea.\\
191 - I'll tell you who his divorce was hard on. Me.\\
192 - - Stop playing the martyr. - Stop living in my house.\\
193 - - Here we go. - You keep saying that, but you never go.\\
194 - I think I'll just go powder my nose.\\
195 - - See? You drove her away. - Oh, I drove her away?\\
196 - - I'm not the one with the poop talk. - Poop talk?\\
197 - You called my son a turd in a punch bowl.\\
198 - I said it with love.\\
199 - Anyway, I know what's going on, and it's not gonna work. Angie's with me.\\
200 - - Hey, she's my friend too. - Well, she and I are more than friends.\\
201 - - Oh, really? Have you slept with her? - That's none of your business.\\
202 - Oh, my God, you haven't. I was just taking a shot in the dark.\\
203 - No, that's your sex life.\\
204 - If you haven't slept with Angie, it's a level playing field.\\
205 - - You think so? - I do.\\
206 - Oh, hey. What are we doing?\\
207 - - We're going upstairs. - Okey-dokey.\\
208 - Good night, Alan.\\
209 - Good night.\\
210 - Hey, Al?\\
211 - - Morning. - What's good about it?\\
212 - I didn't say good.\\
213 - Hey, why aren't you studying for your test?\\
214 - I thought we settled this, Dad.\\
215 - Turn off the TV, go to your room and study.\\
216 - - You'll never learn. - Hey, hey, I heard that.\\
217 - - So? - So I'm an adult.\\
218 - I don't have to learn anything.\\
219 - What's bugging you, zippy?\\
220 - Your blow-up doll ran off with the pool toy?\\
221 - Just mind your business and do your job.\\
222 - Wanna rephrase that?\\
223 - Desperately.\\
224 - - Good morning, everyone. - At least somebody's in a good mood.\\
225 - Well, I'm not usually one to kiss and tell, but:\\
226 - So who's the lucky receptacle?\\
227 - Do not talk about Angie that way. She's a lady.\\
228 - During the day.\\
229 - But once the lights go down:\\
230 - - All right, fine. We get the picture. - Oh, I don't think you do.\\
231 - She left an hour ago, but it took me till now to safely zip up my pants.\\
232 - You know, there are parts of Angie that could sue Disneyland...\\
233 - ...for claiming it's the happiest place on Earth.\\
234 - Oh, go to hell.\\
235 - - Alan, Alan, wait. - What?\\
236 - Hi, is Charlie here?\\
237 - Oh, for God's sake. They just drop out of the sky for him.\\
238 - - Tricia? - Hi, Charlie. Can I talk to you?\\
239 - I guess. What's up?\\
240 - I've made a horrible mistake. I can't marry Jeremy.\\
241 - - Who's Jeremy? - Angie's son.\\
242 - I thought I wanted to settle down.\\
243 - But when I saw you the other night, I realized I'm not over you.\\
244 - Okay, you understand that I'm involved with Jeremy's mother, right?\\
245 - Well, I know, but I don't understand.\\
246 - You're not alone.\\
247 - I'm so confused. I just had to see you.\\
248 - Oh, come on, come on. It will be all right.\\
249 - Can I get you anything? Something to drink?\\
250 - - Could I have a glass of water? - Sure.\\
251 - - Here, sit down. - Thank you.\\
252 - Alan, where do we keep the water?\\
253 - Kitchen.\\
254 - - Back in a flash. - "Where do we keep the water?"\\
255 - Hey, I know where the Scotch is, I know where the ice cubes are. That's enough.\\
256 - Okay, let me get this straight. Angie's son is engaged to that woman...\\
257 - ...who you used to be involved with, who now wants you back?\\
258 - Scorecards, you can't tell the players without the scorecards.\\
259 - - Yeah, what am I gonna do? - I know what I'd do.\\
260 - Yeah, three pumps and an apology.\\
261 - What? You got another move I ain't heard about?\\
262 - Okay, forget about what I'd do. That woman is gorgeous.\\
263 - - How could you possibly pass that up? - Easy. I care about Angie.\\
264 - Forget about Angie. You don't need Angie.\\
265 - You're trying to sabotage my relationship so you can have Angie.\\
266 - What? No, no, no.\\
267 - No.\\
268 - Come on, look at her. She's young, needy and vulnerable.\\
269 - Go fetch.\\
270 - No, no, it's not worth it. I'm not gonna screw things up with Angie.\\
271 - Who's gonna tell her? I'm not gonna tell her.\\
272 - - That's not the point. - Okay, think about this.\\
273 - In a few years, Tricia will be what? Twenty-nine?\\
274 - Angie's gonna be 60.\\
275 - You're looking at grandkids, liver spots and a dusty bowl of hard candy.\\
276 - - I don't like any of those. - Of course you don't, nobody does.\\
277 - Go ahead. Do it.\\
278 - Defile her.\\
279 - - Here you are. - Oh, thanks.\\
280 - Listen, Tricia.\\
281 - You know how I feel about you. We had some great times together.\\
282 - - Remember Vegas? - Oh, yeah.\\
283 - - We didn't leave the room for three days. - Oh, yeah.\\
284 - Of course, I couldn't leave because I made you tie me to the bed.\\
285 - Oh, yeah.\\
286 - Do you ever hear from the other two girls?\\
287 - Oh, yeah.\\
288 - Look, this isn't a good idea. You need to go.\\
289 - But can't we just talk a little more?\\
290 - If we could just talk, you wouldn't need to go.\\
291 - - Wait... But, Charlie... - Trust me.\\
292 - Jeremy is a great guy.\\
293 - And he obviously loves you. I say give him a chance.\\
294 - But what if you and I had just one last fling?\\
295 - One last fling?\\
296 - Yeah, yeah, we'll go back to Vegas. This time, I'll tie you up.\\
297 - You really need to go.\\
298 - - But Charlie, wait, wait... - Bye-bye, bye-bye.\\
299 - It's not too late.\\
300 - - You can still have her. - I'm not listening.\\
301 - You could do it in her car. How hot is that?\\
302 - - I can't hear you. - It's dirty in a car.\\
303 - - What the hell do you want? - What?\\
304 - Tricia broke off her engagement with Jeremy because of you.\\
305 - No, no, no.\\
306 - - I was good. Honest. - He was crushed.\\
307 - My little boy had a nervous breakdown and tried to drink bleach.\\
308 - Yeah, but I was good.\\
309 - Oh, good. Tricia told us everything about you and her.\\
310 - Everything? And he was still crushed?\\
311 - You lied to me.\\
312 - No, no, no, I didn't lie. I just didn't tell.\\
313 - It was a long time ago.\\
314 - And I didn't want you to be jealous because she's young and you're...\\
315 - - I'm what? - A real trouper?\\
316 - Drop dead.\\
317 - But I was good.\\
318 - - Well, you can't say I didn't warn you. - You did. You warned me.\\
319 - - But did you listen? - No.\\
320 - - Do you ever listen? - No.\\
321 - - Are you listening now? - No.\\
322 - So you're just gonna sit there and feel sorry for yourself?\\
323 - No, I'm also gonna drink.\\
324 - Oh, come on, Charles. This isn't like you. Apart from the drinking.\\
325 - - What do you want me to do? - I want you to do what you always do.\\
326 - Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, call one of your little whores.\\
327 - Mom, have you ever considered trying to be nurturing and supportive?\\
328 - When have I ever been anything else?\\
329 - Right. I don't know what I was thinking.\\
330 - Oh, it's okay. I've had a lifetime of being hurt by you.\\
331 - At this point, I'm just one big scab.\\
332 - Where have you been?\\
333 - I figured since you weren't seeing Angie anymore, I'd stop by and say hello.\\
334 - - And? - She's a really mean drunk.\\
335 - Well, as I was trying to tell your brother...\\
336 - ...single women that age are notoriously unstable.\\
337 - What? I'm nowhere near her age.\\
338 - Hey, Grandma, guess what? I'm gonna be in eighth grade next year.\\
339 - Really? Is this a move forward?\\
340 - - Yes. - Yes.\\
341 - Then congratulations.\\
342 - Next stop, clown college.\\
343 - There's a college for clowns?\\
344 - Okay. Clown junior college.\\

9 - Did it not end well?\\
10 - It went fine for me.\\
11 - Although, in retrospect,\\

13 - with a little more tact and sensitivity\\
14 - and a little less, you know, banging her best friend.\\
15 - Oh, God!\\
16 - Hey, hey, her friend was a double-jointed sex freak\\
17 - with daddy issues-- what was I supposed to do?\\
18 - You're right. Your hands were tied.\\

21 - Her or the friend? 'Cause there was a brief overlap.\\

71 - It's a nickname for Charles, isn't it?\\
72 - So are Chaz, Chad, Chick and Charlie. What's your point?\\
73 - No point. It's just that you haven't seen that woman\\
74 - in nine years, and little Chuck is, uh...\\
75 - Well, how old do you suppose little Chuck is?\\
76 - What difference does it make?\\
77 - Well, I'd say little Chuck is, uh...\\
78 - seven or eight years old,\\
79 - give or take nine months.\\
80 - What are you implying? 'Cause I don't know\\
81 - what you're talking about. You don't?\\
82 - Okay, I choose not to.\\
83 - JAKE: Oh, crap!\\
84 - Dad, quick, we gotta go home!\\
85 - Why, what's wrong? My battery died.\\
86 - Oh, no, wait.\\
87 - I just turned it off by accident.\\
88 - This wouldn't happen if I had a smartphone.\\
89 - Do I even need to say it?\\
90 - So is it just me\\
91 - or did that kid kind of look like Uncle Charlie?\\
92 - * Men.\\
93 - Hey. Hey.\\
94 - * And the cat's in the cradle *\\
95 - * And the silver spoon\\
96 - * Little boy blue and the man on the moon *\\
97 - Shut up, Alan.\\
98 - * When you coming home, Dad? *\\
99 - * I don't know when...\\
100 - It's not funny.\\
101 - Well, maybe not funny ha-ha,\\
102 - but certainly funny hee-hee.\\
103 - That boy was nothing like me.\\
104 - Well, he didn't have ear hair and whiskey breath,\\
105 - but I'm guessing he'll grow into that.\\
106 - What's going on?\\
107 - Well, it would appear that the ol' spermonator here...\\
108 - ...has fathered a child.\\
109 - I did not.\\
110 - How can you be so sure?\\
111 - 'Cause I never play in the rain\\
112 - without a slicker and galoshes.\\
113 - I'm confused.\\
114 - Where do the galoshes go?\\
115 - It's just a figure of speech.\\
116 - Everything that needs to be covered is covered\\
117 - when, you know, covering is appropriate.\\
118 - I didn't ask for your life story.\\
119 - I was just confused about the galoshes.\\
120 - You know, Charlie,\\
121 - even condoms are only 98% effective.\\
122 - That's not true.\\
123 - The hell it isn't.\\
124 - Haven't you ever read the package?\\
125 - Who reads the package?\\
126 - It's not like a cereal box.\\
127 - You don't read it while you're eating.\\
128 - Yikes.\\
129 - Come on, Charlie, do the math.\\
130 - You haven't seen the woman in nine years\\
131 - and she's got an eight-year-old.\\
132 - So what?\\
133 - You showed up at my door with a ten-year-old\\
134 - and I hadn't seen you in 11 years.\\
135 - Does that mean taterhead is our love child?\\
136 - All right, fine, stay in denial.\\
137 - There's no way little Chuck is your son.\\
138 - "Chuck"?\\
139 - Hey, hey, lots of kids are named Chuck,\\
140 - play the piano and look disturbingly like me.\\
141 - He's right.\\
142 - In fact, I'm surprised\\
143 - we're not up to our asses in 'em.\\
144 - * Men.\\
145 - Hey, Russell? I'm busy.\\
146 - I've got a question about these condoms.\\
147 - I told you, Charlie,\\
148 - I'm giving you the best bulk rate I can.\\
149 - I know, but that's not what I was...\\
150 - There's just no way I can compete with the big chain stores.\\
151 - I understand.\\
152 - So I make it up in personal service.\\
153 - I'm sure you do. I mean, I'm not going\\
154 - to unroll the damn things and put 'em on for you,\\
155 - but short of that, I've got your back.\\
156 - And I appreciate it.\\
157 - But that's not what I was asking about.\\
158 - Charlie, times are tough.\\
159 - People don't get their drugs from their friendly\\
160 - neighborhood pharmacist anymore.\\
161 - They go on the Internet.\\
162 - I know.\\
163 - Sure, trust your mailman\\
164 - with your heart medicine and stool softeners.\\
165 - Russell, have you been hittin' the free samples again?\\
166 - What are you, a cop?\\
167 - No, I'm just a little concerned about you.\\
168 - Well, if you're so concerned, help me out a little bit.\\
169 - Why don't you buy some reading glasses\\
170 - or a neck brace once in a while.\\
171 - Sure, whatever.\\
172 - A bag of Skittles for God's sake.\\
173 - You know, 'cause my margin on condoms is bubkes.\\
174 - Yeah, well, speaking of condoms,\\
175 - I just want to know if somebody could get pregnant\\
176 - even if you were wearing a condom.\\
177 - Have you been talking to the Wetzel's Pretzels lady?\\
178 - Because I just gave her a ride home, that's it.\\
179 - No, no, no, no, I mean in general.\\
180 - What are the odds that a condom wouldn't work?\\
181 - Well, there are a number of things to factor in.\\
182 - Oh, cough syrup?\\
183 - I don't have a cough.\\
184 - Neither do I.\\
185 - Anyway, condoms.\\
186 - Whenever you're dealing with a manufactured product,\\
187 - there's always going to be flaws in the process.\\
188 - Yeah, but aren't they supposed to be tested before they go out?\\
189 - Or in?\\
190 - Well, sure, but they don't test every one.\\
191 - They don't?\\
192 - Masturbating's looking\\
193 - better and better, huh?\\
194 - Okay, okay, so bottom line, what you're saying is\\
195 - even if I'm wearing a condom,\\
196 - there's a chance I could get someone pregnant?\\
197 - Did you miss eighth grade health class, Charlie?\\
198 - Oh, come on, who went to health class?\\
199 - Well, amongst others,\\
200 - a certain self-medicating pharmacist\\
201 - who pays alimony to three different women,\\
202 - but not one penny in child support.\\
203 - All right, all right, for future reference,\\
204 - what about lambskin? Are they more effective?\\
205 - Well, um, less so than your latex product.\\
206 - Now I had to stop wearing them myself because something\\
207 - about the smell made my cat go berserk.\\
208 - It kind of a cute story.\\
209 - I don't... I don't want to hear it.\\
210 - Not a cat person, huh?\\
211 - I'm not either anymore.\\
212 - All right, well, thanks, Russell. I'll see ya.\\
213 - Th-Th-That's it?\\
214 - You're not going to buy anything?\\
215 - We've got Wiffle ball bats.\\
216 - Maybe your little bastard would like a Wiffle ball bat.\\
217 - Childproof.\\
218 - * Men.\\
219 - Hey. Hey.\\
220 - You all right?\\
221 - No, I am not.\\
222 - What's going on?\\
223 - Alan, I have always conducted my sex life\\
224 - according to three simple principles.\\
225 - One: if at all possible, ladies first.\\
226 - Two: it's easier to be forgiven than ask permission.\\
227 - And third, and most important:\\
228 - the ten seconds it takes to put on a condom\\
229 - beats the hell out of the ten years\\
230 - you have to pretend to like soccer.\\
231 - Except when they don't work.\\
232 - Stupid tiny disclaimer on the side of the box.\\
233 - They should put it in big letters\\
234 - right on the reservoir tip.\\
235 - "Do you feel lucky, dumb ass?"\\
236 - Yeah, that'd do it.\\
237 - So, what's your next move?\\
238 - Well, you'd think if Chrissy had my child\\
239 - and decided not to tell me, I'd just send her a little card.\\
240 - You know, "Thanks for being a good sport" or something.\\
241 - I'm not sure Hallmark has a deadbeat dad section.\\
242 - It doesn't matter.\\
243 - For some reason, I want to know the truth.\\
244 - If I have a kid, I need to know about it.\\
245 - Of course you do.\\
246 - Being a father is the greatest joy there is.\\
247 - Hey, Dad, where's the plunger?\\
248 - Uh, laundry room.\\
249 - Thanks, I over-wiped.\\
250 - No such thing, my son.\\
251 - Where was I?\\
252 - The joys of fatherhood.\\
253 - Right.\\
254 - What? There was a time when he didn't wipe at all.\\
255 - Hey, I'm gonna need a mop, too.\\
256 - Excuse me.\\
257 - Father/son moment.\\
258 - * People, let me tell you about my best friend *\\
259 - * He's a warmhearted person\\
260 - * Who'd love me till the end\\
261 - * People, let me tell you about my best friend *\\
262 - * He's one boy cuddly toy\\
263 - * My up, my down, my pride and joy *\\
264 - * People, let me tell you about him, he's so much fun *\\
265 - * Whether we're talking man-to-man *\\
266 - * Or whether we're talking son-to-son *\\
267 - * 'Cause he's my best friend\\
268 - * Yeah, he's my best friend...\\
269 - (humming)\\
270 - (scatting)\\
271 - (record scratching, music stops)\\
272 - ALL: Daddy's home!\\
273 - (excited chattering)\\
274 - ALAN: Hurry! Hurry!\\
275 - * Men.\\
276 - Hey, Jake?\\
277 - Don't worry. It's all cleaned up.\\
278 - Not why I'm here.\\
279 - You can hardly smell it at all anymore.\\
280 - Don't kid yourself.\\
281 - Although I may owe you a toilet.\\
282 - I'll put it on your tab.\\
283 - Now, I want to ask you a question.\\
284 - Crumb cake, a frappuccino and a burrito supreme.\\
285 - That's not the question.\\
286 - Oh, yeah, and a tangerine.\\
287 - That's what killed me.\\
288 - Are you done?\\
289 - I hope so, 'cause the toilet won't flush anymore.\\
290 - What-What I wanted to ask you is\\
291 - do you think I've been a good role model?\\
292 - Are you kidding?\\
293 - You drink, you gamble,\\
294 - you have different women here practically every night.\\
295 - You're the best role model a guy could want.\\
296 - You think so?\\
297 - Yeah, they should put your face on money.\\
298 - Well, thanks, buddy.\\
299 - I appreciate it.\\
300 - Oh, hey, one more question.\\
301 - How would you feel about having a cousin?\\
302 - I've got a cousin.\\
303 - I mean, another cousin.\\
304 - What do I need another cousin for?\\
305 - Forget it.\\
306 - What I need is a smartphone and a new toilet.\\
307 - (scoffs): Cousin.\\
308 - * Men.\\
309 - Charlie.\\
310 - Hi.\\
311 - What are you doing here?\\
312 - Well, I was in the neighborhood.\\
313 - I thought I'd stop by and say hello\\
314 - and bring you this.\\
315 - A Wiffle ball bat.\\
316 - That's for Chuck.\\
317 - I got you an eyeglass repair kit\\
318 - and some malted milk balls.\\
319 - Thanks.\\
320 - I know it's not much of a gift, but the guy\\
321 - that usually sells roses at the freeway on-ramp,\\
322 - well, he switched to oranges,\\
323 - and I didn't know if you liked oranges.\\
324 - So anyway, is Chuck my kid?\\
325 - What difference does it make?\\
326 - Well, it makes all the difference in the world.\\
327 - How?\\
328 - Well, for starters,\\
329 - I'm gonna write a scathing letter\\
330 - to a certain manufacturer of latex products.\\
331 - But more importantly,\\
332 - if I'm his dad, he should know.\\
333 - He's already got a dad.\\
334 - Oh, really? Yes.\\
335 - We may not live together anymore\\
336 - and he may not have your kind of money,\\
337 - but he's a good dad,\\
338 - and he loves Chuck very much.\\
339 - So you're just raising him on your own?\\
340 - Charlie, you don't have to worry about him.\\
341 - He's gotten along just fine without you\\
342 - for the last eight years and so have I.\\
343 - But wait, Chrissy!\\
344 - I didn't know!\\
345 - Boy, you miss one health class.\\
346 - * Men.\\
347 - So, Jake,\\
348 - how do you like high school?\\
349 - I'm in eight grade.\\
350 - I see.\\
351 - When do you start high school?\\
352 - Hard to say.\\
353 - Eighth grade is really kicking my ass.\\
354 - Jake, language.\\
355 - Yeah, language, math,\\
356 - science, history, phys ed.\\
357 - I understand, dear.\\
358 - I can't even find my locker.\\
359 - All right, I talked to her.\\
360 - You owe me five bucks.\\
361 - He's a good wiper, and I love him.\\
362 - Hey, Alan,\\
363 - I just spoke... aw, geez.\\
364 - Good to see you, too, dear.\\
365 - What's going on, Mom?\\
366 - Nothing.\\
367 - I merely stop in to see my two sons\\
368 - and my one and only grandchild.\\
369 - Well, it's...\\
370 - (groans)\\
371 - So, Mom, you're looking good.\\
372 - Did you have something snipped or tucked or sucked?\\
373 - Just eyes and tush.\\
374 - But nice of you to notice.\\
375 - Hey, Charlie, did you ever find out if that kid is yours?\\
376 - Thanks a lot, Berta.\\
377 - Oh, dear, have I spoken out of turn?\\
378 - Kid?\\
379 - Yeah, well, it-it-it turns out\\
380 - that there are flaws in every manufacturing process\\
381 - and that includes your everyday latex products.\\
382 - I see.\\
383 - And how far along is the young lady?\\
384 - Oh, about eight years.\\
385 - Eight years and she's just suing you now?\\
386 - She's not suing me.\\
387 - She doesn't want to have anything to do with me.\\
388 - Lucky you.\\
389 - If I were her, I'd have owned half this house\\
390 - before the pee stick dried.\\
391 - Yeah, real lucky.\\
392 - I got an eight-year-old son\\
393 - and I'll never get to spend any time with him.\\
394 - Oh, sweetheart, look, take it from me.\\
395 - Spending time with one's children is greatly overrated.\\
396 - Oh, come on, face facts.\\
397 - Some people are meant to be parents and some people aren't.\\
398 - And you have a perfect example of that\\
399 - sitting right in front of you.\\
400 - You certainly do.\\
401 - Yeah, well, I think I'd be a great dad.\\
402 - Well, easy for you to say now that you've dodged the bullet.\\
403 - You're right,\\
404 - talk is cheap.\\
405 - Remind me to speak to him\\
406 - about putting this house in my name\\
407 - so it can never fall into the hands of some money-hungry,\\
408 - manipulative bitch.\\
409 - That isn't related to him.\\
410 - * Men.\\
411 - What do you want now, Charlie?\\
412 - Look, I can see\\
413 - why you might not think of me as father material.\\
414 - And clearly you've done a great job\\
415 - raising Chuck on your own.\\
416 - I'd just like, if you'd let me,\\
417 - to help out a little bit.\\
418 - Oh.\\
419 - This is more than a little bit.\\
420 - Hey, eight years is a long time.\\
421 - What do you want out of this?\\
422 - I just want to know that he's taken care of.\\
423 - And I plan on sending you a check every month.\\
424 - I-I don't know what to say.\\
425 - You don't have to worry about me interfering.\\
426 - Although, there's a couple of things you should know\\
427 - for when he gets older.\\
428 - Like what?\\
429 - Well, you're gonna want to lock the liquor cabinet...\\
430 - But don't forget that mouthwash\\
431 - can also pack a pretty good buzz.\\
432 - So be on guard for suspiciously minty breath.\\
433 - Oh, and if his school nurse is at all attractive,\\
434 - you can expect the occasional hernia.\\
435 - Thanks for the heads up.\\
436 - You're welcome.\\
437 - So, uh,...\\
438 - Good luck.\\
439 - You're gonna need it.\\
440 - Oh, hey.\\
441 - Jeremy, your mom's here.\\
442 - Hey, Mom. Hi, honey.\\
443 - Hey, where'd you get that shirt?\\
444 - Oh, I got it for him. I hope that's okay.\\
445 - I love it.\\
446 - He looks like a little ladies' man.\\
447 - So, uh, is this time next week okay for you?\\
448 - Actually,\\
449 - I think my babysitting days are behind me.\\
450 - Ciao.\\
451 - * Men.\\
452 - Thank you. You'll see.\\
453 - It's a great feeling knowing you're...\\
454 - you're taking care of your own kid.\\
455 - Oh, hey, Mr. Harper.\\
456 - Hey, Clive, how's it going? Great.\\
457 - All right, Mrs. Melnick, that should hold you for a while.\\
458 - Hey, dude. Hey, dude.\\
459 - Thanks, Clive, you're the best.\\
460 - Come on in, honey.\\
461 - Thanks, Alan. Bye, buddy.\\
462 - Who was that guy?\\
463 - Oh, that's Clive, the exterminator.\\
464 - He's been coming here forever.\\
465 - Huh. Hey, Alan,\\
466 - Mm-hmm. has it ever occurred to you...\\
467 - Hey, Mr. Harper.\\
468 - Hey, Craig.\\
469 - Has what ever occurred to me?\\
470 - Nothing.\\
471 - Hey, Mr. H.\\
472 - Long time no see.
\subsection {Episode 02: Pie Hole, Herb}
1 - Thanks, Mom. This is a perfect first job.\\
2 - First job?\\
3 - I think you're looking at a birth of a career.\\
4 - I was going to have him put up fliers,\\
5 - but I didn't trust him with a staple gun.\\
6 - How much are you paying him?\\
7 - Obviously, too much. Look at him.\\
8 - For the record, I promised him $20 and a Playboy magazine.\\
9 - Playboy?\\
10 - Don't worry. I'll Magic-Marker over the ta-tas and hoo-hoos.\\
11 - Oh, that's disturbing on so many levels.\\
12 - (ice cream truck playing music)\\
13 - I should've hired a monkey.\\
14 - You mean a different monkey.\\
15 - Well, it's not really a paycheck,\\
16 - and he's not really earning it\\
17 - and we don't call him...\\
18 - I guess I got to give you Jughead.\\
19 - I remember my first job.\\
20 - Slaughterhouse.\\
21 - Strippin' out sheep intestines for the condom companies.\\
22 - Not as sexy as it sounds.\\
23 - I was a fluffer in a pet salon.\\
24 - You know, with a blow dryer.\\
25 - Huh. I was going a completely different way.\\
26 - What are you doing?\\
27 - Thanks to Grandma,\\
28 - I'm reading an interview with Jimmy Kimmel.\\
29 - Hey, Alan, you got any cash?\\
30 - Yeah. Why?\\
31 - I need to borrow some.\\
32 - What for?\\
33 - What are you, my mother?\\
34 - Just give me a few bucks, save me a trip to the ATM.\\
35 - When will I get it back?\\
36 - I don't know. Tomorrow.\\
37 - Okay, how much do you need?\\
38 - Just a couple hundred.\\
39 - A couple hundred?\\
40 - Who carries around that kind of money?\\
41 - Well, let's see...\\
42 - Strippers, bookies, prostitutes,\\
43 - and not entirely coincidentally-- me.\\
44 - Well, I've only got... 35, 36... $38.\\
45 - That's it?\\
46 - That's your walking around money?\\
47 - It's the perfect amount in case I get mugged.\\
48 - See, not so little that my attacker\\
49 - will get angry and try and pistol-whip me,\\
50 - yet not so much that I would feel obliged to fight for it\\
51 - and possibly be shot while wrestling for the gun.\\
52 - So you got $38.\\
53 - Yep.\\
54 - Just out of curiosity, how much money would it take\\
55 - for you to wrestle a gun from a mugger?\\
56 - Assuming a small- to medium- sized mugger, at least $40.\\
57 - Fine, so, give me the $38.\\
58 - All of it?\\
59 - Why not? Then I've got nothing.\\
60 - And you think $38 changes that?\\
61 - What if I decide to go out and have some fun?\\
62 - $38 worth of fun?\\
63 - I wouldn't spend all of it.\\
64 - Okay, okay, look, you're not going out to have fun.\\
65 - You never go out to have fun, because you know why?\\
66 - You're not a fun guy.\\
67 - Oh, I am very much a fun guy.\\
68 - We just have different definitions of fun,\\
69 - and mine doesn't include urinary tract infections\\
70 - and dry heaving.\\
71 - Just give me the money, ya big fruit.\\
72 - $38...\\
73 - If it had been $40, we'd be wrestling, my friend!\\
74 - ALAN: Hey, Charlie?\\
75 - You got my money?\\
76 - Charlie!\\
77 - I'm trying to sleep, Alan.\\
78 - Yeah, well, I've got to go to work and you said\\
79 - you'd have my money. Oh, for God's sake.\\
80 - You don't even have to get up. Just tell me where it is.\\
81 - Well, the last I saw any of it, it was sandwiched between\\
82 - two of the loveliest man-made breasts\\
83 - that ever smacked me in the eye.\\
84 - Oh, Charlie, you say the sweetest things.\\
85 - Oh, Ginger, this is my brother Alan.\\
86 - Alan, Ginger.\\
87 - Hi.\\
88 - Hi.\\
89 - So bottom line, you don't have my money?\\
90 - No.\\
91 - The money you promised to pay back today?\\
92 - The day hasn't even started yet.\\
93 - It started for me.\\
94 - That's only because\\
95 - you're on Douchebag Savings Time.\\
96 - Can we please talk about this\\
97 - when one of us doesn't have a warm, firm buttock\\
98 - nestled against his groin?\\
99 - Oh, dear Lord.\\
100 - So you'll get it by tonight?\\
101 - I'm hopin' to get it as soon as you close the door.\\
102 - Are you really out of cash?\\
103 - Don't worry. I've got hooker money.\\
104 - (plays piano): * When you're hungry at school\\
105 - * You need to know\\
106 - * Paste yes, boogers no.\\
107 - Hey.\\
108 - How was your day, darling?\\
109 - Fine, except I had to pay for lunch\\
110 - with my lucky Sacagawea dollar.\\
111 - What kind of lunch can you get for a dollar?\\
112 - Two gas station hot dogs that were a year old\\
113 - if they were a day, thank you very much.\\
114 - Is Sacagawea the same Indian chick\\
115 - that's on the Land O'Lakes butter?\\
116 - I don't know.\\
117 - I hope so.\\
118 - I'd like to believe it is.\\
119 - Okay, Charlie, I'm leaving.\\
120 - Hang on. Let me pay you.\\
121 - Here you go.\\
122 - Did you forget I paid for that pizza the other night?\\
123 - Oh, right. How much was that?\\
124 - Well, you got the garlic balls too, so, say... 75 bucks.\\
125 - You got change for a hundred?\\
126 - Nope.\\
127 - Okay, you'll pay me back.\\
128 - Count on it.\\
129 - Wait, wait, wait, as long as you're doling it out,\\
130 - you got my 40 bucks?\\
131 - Oh, sure. You got change for a hundred?\\
132 - Nope. Okay, I'll catch you later.\\
133 - Wait...\\
134 - How come Berta can pay you back and I can't?\\
135 - Oh, grow up.\\
136 - She's not gonna pay me back.\\
137 - Okay, then, what about me?\\
138 - What about you?\\
139 - I want my $40.\\
140 - I only borrowed $38.\\
141 - Yeah, well, I find round numbers easier to remember.\\
142 - Oh, you like round numbers, do you?\\
143 - Yes, I like round numbers.\\
144 - Okay, here's a round number for you.\\
145 - Zero.\\
146 - Nice, tight circular shape.\\
147 - Nothing gets in, nothing gets out.\\
148 - Sound familiar, Alan?\\
149 - Are you calling me anal?\\
150 - That's right. A-L-A-N, anal.\\
151 - Okay, okay, okay.\\
152 - So, so bottom line,\\
153 - you're not gonna pay me back. Is that correct?\\
154 - Well, truth be told,\\
155 - I was gonna pay you back, but your attitude irks me.\\
156 - I irk you?\\
157 - That's right. I find you irksome.\\
158 - You're a big, fat irk.\\
159 - Hey, hey, you borrow $38, you owe me $38.\\
160 - Yeah, well, you've been living\\
161 - in my Malibu beach house for six years.\\
162 - You owe me $1 million.\\
163 - A million dollars?!\\
164 - That's a one followed by six tight little sphincters.\\
165 - (panting)\\
166 - Wow. You look tired.\\
167 - Yesterday, I had a quarter tank of gas.\\
168 - Today, I drive a mile into Topanga Canyon\\
169 - and bang, empty.\\
170 - Huh.\\
171 - There's no cell coverage up there,\\
172 - so I had to hump all the way back down to the beach\\
173 - to call Triple-A.\\
174 - Oh, that's a shame.\\
175 - Shame, my ass. How the hell\\
176 - did a quarter tank of gas disappear overnight?\\
177 - It's a mystery.\\
178 - (sniffs)\\
179 - Wait a minute...\\
180 - I smell gasoline.\\
181 - Really?\\
182 - (sniffs)\\
183 - I... I don't smell anything.\\
184 - (sniffs)\\
185 - You have gas on your breath.\\
186 - You siphoned my tank.\\
187 - Oh, please.\\
188 - You think I stuck a rubber hose down your gas tank,\\
189 - sucked on it until the gas ran out of your tank and into mine\\
190 - thereby compensating me for the $38 you owe me?\\
191 - That's preposterous.\\
192 - Yeah...\\
193 - Yeah, you're right.\\
194 - What was I thinking?\\
195 - What are you doing?\\
196 - Do me a favor. Say...\\
197 - "preposterous" again.\\
198 - You're crazy!\\
199 - Get that away from me!\\
200 - Oh, come on.\\
201 - Come on.\\
202 - Just for grins say, "Help me. My head's on fire."\\
203 - All right, all right, all right,\\
204 - I sucked the gas out of your car!\\
205 - Now turn it off!\\
206 - Okay, fine. Well played.\\
207 - You got your money back.\\
208 - Um... actually...\\
209 - at 473.9 cents a gallon,\\
210 - you had only $13.22 worth in your tank,\\
211 - so you still owe me $24.78.\\
212 - Get out.\\
213 - What?\\
214 - Get out of my house.\\
215 - You know what? I just might.\\
216 - No, no, no, "might" implies you have a choice.\\
217 - Oh, so you're going to throw me out over $24.78?\\
218 - No, I'm throwing you out\\
219 - because you're a cheap, gas-sucking, flammable irk!\\
220 - I am not cheap.\\
221 - Leaving.\\
222 - Ow, ow, ow!\\
223 - These things just happen.\\
224 - I don't know. They seem to happen to you a lot.\\
225 - (knocking)\\
226 - Oh, hey, guys.\\
227 - What are you doing here?\\
228 - Dad pissed off Uncle Charlie again.\\
229 - Sorry to show up unannounced like this.\\
230 - No problem.\\
231 - It's always good to see you.\\
232 - JUDITH: He got kicked out again?!\\
233 - Damn it, Alan. What'd you do now?\\
234 - I didn't do anything.\\
235 - But I'm not going to be staying at Charlie's anymore,\\
236 - so I thought I should bring Jake's stuff back here\\
237 - until I find a place of my own.\\
238 - Fine. Good luck.\\
239 - But it's nobody's fault.\\
240 - I just think it's time for me to move on.\\
241 - Okay. Good night.\\
242 - But FYI: Charlie's a thief, a liar\\
243 - and I suspect something of a firebug.\\
244 - Really? Hmm, he struck me as a straight shooter.\\
245 - Little loosey-goosey with the liquor and the ladies,\\
246 - but all in all, a good fella.\\
247 - In what universe is Charlie Harper a good fella?\\
248 - Well, I certainly don't know him as well as you do,\\
249 - so I'll just shut my piehole.\\
250 - Uh, anyway, here's the rest of Jake's stuff.\\
251 - I'll get you my new address\\
252 - as soon as I have one.\\
253 - You do that.\\
254 - So, where are you gonna stay till then?\\
255 - Piehole, Herb.\\
256 - Oh, I don't know.\\
257 - Things are a little tight right now,\\
258 - so a hotel isn't really an option.\\
259 - Maybe the Y for a couple of days, you know,\\
260 - but we'll see.\\
261 - I could sleep in my office or... in the car.\\
262 - Oh, well, you can't do that.\\
263 - Piehole, piehole, piehole!\\
264 - Come on, Judith, you can't expect\\
265 - a man to sleep in his car.\\
266 - You're good people. Just let me just get a few things.\\
267 - I'm sure it'll be fine.\\
268 - He's not the kind of guy who'll overstay his welcome.\\
269 - He's been at his brother's for six years.\\
270 - Uh, Herb, would you mind\\
271 - giving me a hand with the NordicTrack?\\
272 - Oh, sure.\\
273 - Love you.\\
274 - (doorbell rings)\\
275 - Hey, Charlie.\\
276 - Oh, hey, Herb, what's up?\\
277 - I came to pick up some stuff for Alan.\\
278 - For Alan?\\
279 - Yeah, he's staying with Judith and I\\
280 - till he gets back on his feet.\\
281 - Gee, Herb, I hate to be the bearer of bad news,\\
282 - but I've been waiting six years for that khaki-wearing weasel\\
283 - to get on his feet.\\
284 - Judith mentioned that...\\
285 - using a lot of the same words, interestingly enough.\\
286 - Anyway, he wanted to avoid having a scene with you,\\
287 - so he asked if I'd pick up some of his stuff.\\
288 - And you agreed?\\
289 - I had to get out of there, Charlie.\\
290 - Okay, okay, fine.\\
291 - What do you need?\\
292 - Quite a few things, actually.\\
293 - He gave me a list.\\
294 - Well, let him stay in there long enough,\\
295 - he'll give you a bleeding ulcer.\\
296 - Yeah, Judith said that, too.\\
297 - Anyway, uh, melatonin, a mouth guard.\\
298 - I guess he grinds his teeth at night.\\
299 - I myself have restless legs syndrome.\\
300 - But just the left leg.\\
301 - Right leg sleeps like a baby.\\
302 - What else, Herb?\\
303 - Well, I also got apnea and I tend to drool a lot.\\
304 - The list, Herb.\\
305 - Oh, yeah, yeah.\\
306 - Let's see, shower cap, loofa mitt\\
307 - and some kind of little stool\\
308 - that elevates his feet while he's sitting on the toilet.\\
309 - What?\\
310 - Yeah, apparently when\\
311 - the morning coffee doesn't do the job,\\
312 - having his feet up gives him that extra leverage\\
313 - for a successful bowel movement.\\
314 - You're kidding?\\
315 - No. Look.\\
316 - "For a successful BM."\\
317 - That would mean "bowel movement."\\
318 - Okay, fine. Guest bedroom's right down there.\\
319 - Oh.\\
320 - Hey, I just made\\
321 - a pitcher of margaritas. You want one?\\
322 - Oh, gee, I'll have to pass.\\
323 - Judith's waiting for me to get back,\\
324 - and she gets really steamed...\\
325 - Salt or no salt?\\
326 - Salt. Okay. You got it.\\
327 - (TV show playing)\\
328 - This is so weird.\\
329 - It's just for a couple days, Jake.\\
330 - Don't make a federal case.\\
331 - You know this is probably gonna affect my schoolwork.\\
332 - How? It's not like your grades could get any lower.\\
333 - That's good, Alan. Undermine his self-esteem.\\
334 - You see what I have to live with on weekends?\\
335 - Nobody's talking to you.\\
336 - Where's he gonna sleep?\\
337 - I'm not a "he." I'm your father.\\
338 - How'd you get to be my father if you're not a "he"?\\
339 - Go make up the couch.\\
340 - What about the guest room?\\
341 - That's not a guest room anymore.\\
342 - It's Herb's train room.\\
343 - His what?\\
344 - He's a model train aficionado.\\
345 - Aficionado?\\
346 - He works hard. He deserves a hobby.\\
347 - Sometimes he lets me wear the hat.\\
348 - I begged you for years\\
349 - to let me turn that into a game room.\\
350 - Bumper pool, ping-pong, something.\\
351 - Oh, this is different. How?\\
352 - Herb can play with his trains alone.\\
353 - I'm sure he does plenty of stuff in there alone.\\
354 - Excuse me?\\
355 - Nothing.\\
356 - (quietly): I got it.\\
357 - This is so beautiful.\\
358 - Yep.\\
359 - Can I confess something, Charlie?\\
360 - What's that?\\
361 - I sometimes wonder about the road not taken.\\
362 - Which road is that?\\
363 - Your road, Charlie.\\
364 - Oh. It's a good road, Herb.\\
365 - So it's not a matter of the grass always seems greener?\\
366 - No, no. No, the grass is pretty frickin' green over here.\\
367 - Damn!\\
368 - (ringtones playing)\\
369 - Oops. It's me.\\
370 - I hope so.\\
371 - It's the road taken.\\
372 - You're not gonna answer it?\\
373 - Nah. Judith will just harsh my mellow.\\
374 - Yeah, she's a mellow-harsher.\\
375 - But I love her.\\
376 - That's nice.\\
377 - You know, in the boudoir, we're very simpatico.\\
378 - Glad to hear it.\\
379 - On top of everything else,\\
380 - she actually let me put my train set in her back room.\\
381 - Whoo-whoo.\\
382 - (moans)\\
383 - Damn cran-apple juice.\\
384 - I should start wearing a diaper.\\
385 - (urinating)\\
386 - (breaks wind)\\
387 - (urinating continues)\\
388 - (intermittent urinating)\\
389 - (toilet flushes)\\
390 - It's about time you got home.\\
391 - Mm...\\
392 - Is that an apology I'm feeling?\\
393 - Mm...\\
394 - Oopsy.\\
395 - (pounding)\\
396 - Where's my husband?\\
397 - Sleeping on the deck.\\
398 - What? Why?\\
399 - He's drunk.\\
400 - Herb's not a drinker.\\
401 - No argument there.\\
402 - All right, here's how it's gonna go:\\
403 - I am taking him home with me\\
404 - and you're taking back your brother.\\
405 - How 'bout this?\\
406 - You and Alan patch things up and I keep Stretch out there.\\
407 - I'm kinda fond of the big lug.\\
408 - Charlie, I'm in no mood.\\
409 - Not what I heard.\\
410 - What?\\
411 - Whoo-whoo!\\
412 - I don't have time for this. Alan, get in here!\\
413 - No!\\
414 - Do not make me come get you!\\
415 - Now...\\
416 - apologize to your brother.\\
417 - Do it!\\
418 - I'm sorry I made such a big deal out of everything.\\
419 - And?\\
420 - (sighs) And you can keep the $24.78.\\
421 - This was all about $24?\\
422 - Plus he tried to set me on fire!\\
423 - After you sucked my gas!\\
424 - Hey, baby, when did you arrive on the scene?\\
425 - Just get in the car.\\
426 - (whispering): Look, poop stool.\\
427 - Um... I'm gonna need that.\\
428 - You can pop a blood vessel if you push too hard.\\
429 - Words to live by.\\
430 - Herb, car!\\
431 - Bye, Charlie. Bye, Herb.\\
432 - Bye, all. Bye, Herb.\\
433 - This was fun. Let's do it again.\\
434 - Now!\\
435 - Kinda like old times, huh?\\
436 - Judith kicking me out and you taking me in.\\
437 - You are taking me in, aren't you?\\
438 - Give me one good reason why I should.\\
439 - Uh, well...\\
440 - we're... we're family...\\
441 - um... brothers.\\
442 - We share blood and, and, and history.\\
443 - We have a bond that unites us forever.\\
444 - Nah. What else you got?\\
445 - Okay. Uh...\\
446 - what about my French toast?\\
447 - You like that.\\
448 - You know,\\
449 - thick and fluffy with cinnamon and powdered sugar.\\
450 - Mm...!\\
451 - All right, you can stay.\\
452 - Really?\\
453 - No.\\
454 - (flustered chuckle): Ha-ha!\\
455 - Very funny.\\
456 - Charlie?\\
457 - (keys jingle)\\
458 - (thudding at door)\\
459 - You changed the locks?\\
460 - I was only gone for six hours!\\
461 - Charlie?!\\
462 - (thunder rumbles)\\
463 - Oh, crap.\\
464 - Here you go. Black, two sugars.\\
465 - Double glazed.\\
466 - Thank you.\\
467 - No, thank you.\\
468 - I can't believe Grandma fired me.\\
469 - Well, the labor market's very competitive these days.\\
470 - There's always somebody brighter and better\\
471 - and willing to work for less.
\subsection {Episode 03: Damn You, Eggs Benedict}
1 - What are you doing?\\
2 - What does it look like I'm doing?\\
3 - I'd rather not say.\\
4 - I'm trying to open these cinnamon buns.\\
5 - Why?\\
6 - I thought I'd try and do a little baking.\\
7 - Ah.\\
8 - You drunk?\\
9 - A little bit.\\
10 - Mm. Mm-hmm.\\
11 - Why is it child-proof?\\
12 - Are kids o.d.'ing on this stuff?\\
13 - Have you considered reading the instructions?\\
14 - Ooh, listen to Mr. College Boy.\\
15 - "To open, strike sharply on edge of counter."\\
16 - Really?\\
17 - Really.\\
18 - All right. I'll play along.\\
19 - (British accent): I christen thee H.M.S. Kitchen Table.\\
20 - Godspeed.\\
21 - I think we got a bad bun tube.\\
22 - Gimme.\\
23 - You just gotta know how to whack it.\\
24 - I bow to your superior expertise.\\
25 - So, how come you're all spiffed up?\\
26 - I've got a date.\\
27 - Oh, two nights in a row.\\
28 - So, who's the glutton for punishment?\\
29 - At the risk of tooting my own horn,\\
30 - I am actually seeing two different women.\\
31 - Wow, two women. Yeah.\\
32 - And yet you're still tooting your own horn.\\
33 - Hey, you know what's fun?\\
34 - When you can talk 'em into tooting each other's horns.\\
35 - I'm not seeing them at the same time.\\
36 - Well, that makes it more difficult.\\
37 - But not impossible.\\
38 - You put the icing on after it comes out of the oven, right?\\
39 - Right. Drizzle, don't squeeze.\\
40 - Thus spake the whacker.\\
41 - So, what prompted this break from serial monogamy?\\
42 - I don't know, I'm just tired\\
43 - of putting all my eggs in one basket.\\
44 - The basket being a woman? Yes.\\
45 - And the eggs being your bun tube?\\
46 - No, see, the thing is, when I'm just dating\\
47 - one woman at a time, if she dumps me...\\
48 - When she dumps you.\\
49 - Either way, I have to start from scratch\\
50 - finding a new woman.\\
51 - However, when I'm dating two women,\\
52 - if one of them dumps me...\\
53 - When one of them dumps you.\\
54 - Either way, I'm not alone.\\
55 - Wait a second. Wait a second.\\
56 - You're saying that it's advantageous\\
57 - to date more than one woman at a time?\\
58 - Good Lord, man, you're a genius!\\
59 - Yeah, ha-ha.\\
60 - We must tell other men!\\
61 - Okay, maybe I'm a little late to the party.\\
62 - A little late?\\
63 - The girl already jumped out of the cake\\
64 - and everybody's had a piece.\\
65 - Well, late or not, I'm here.\\
66 - And it turns out when it comes to 40-year-old,\\
67 - divorced moms in the San Fernando Valley,\\
68 - I'm quite the catch.\\
69 - I'm not surprised. You're not?\\
70 - Lights out at fat camp,\\
71 - a jelly bean is steak tartar.\\
72 - Hey, I'm single, employed, disease-free, well-read,\\
73 - cute as a bug and perfectly capable\\
74 - of pretending to like other people's children.\\
75 - Impressive.\\
76 - Do these broads know that\\
77 - you're dipping your chip in the salsa and the guacamole?\\
78 - What?\\
79 - You know, hittin' two pinatas with one stick?\\
80 - Toppin' off both tanks with the same hose?\\
81 - Throwin' your balls down two alleys?\\
82 - Still don't get it?\\
83 - No, I got it. And, uh, and thank you.\\
84 - Um... but no, they don't know.\\
85 - These are divorced Valley moms\\
86 - trolling for a new schmuck to replace the old schmuck.\\
87 - And you let them think that might be you?\\
88 - It's not like I have to lie.\\
89 - Look at me-- I scream schmuckdom.\\
90 - They're rising.\\
91 - It's a miracle.\\
92 - Yes, the miracle of yeast.\\
93 - I gotta go.\\
94 - Go, my son.\\
95 - Drizzle thy frosting\\
96 - on the divorced sticky buns of the Valley.\\
97 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
98 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
99 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
100 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
101 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
102 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
103 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
104 - You're a great cook, Uncle Charlie.\\
105 - It's no big deal.\\
106 - Those chefs on TV act\\
107 - like they're curing leprosy or something.\\
108 - Can you make meat loaf?\\
109 - Does it come in a tube?\\
110 - No-- God-- it comes on a plate.\\
111 - Can I have some of that?\\
112 - Beer? No.\\
113 - Why not?\\
114 - Because when you're 14,\\
115 - you don't ask your uncle for beer.\\
116 - Who do I ask?\\
117 - I don't know... try hangin' outside a liquor store\\
118 - and look for a guy wearing house slippers and talking to himself.\\
119 - What's his name?\\
120 - You can't have any beer, Jake.\\
121 - Man, I thought you were cool.\\
122 - I am. And you know what makes me cool?\\
123 - The fact that your opinion means less than squat to me.\\
124 - How old were you when you had your first beer?\\
125 - 13... two... 32.\\
126 - Yeah, right.\\
127 - Listen, we're not talking about me.\\
128 - We're talking about you.\\
129 - What about me?\\
130 - Well, it's like this:\\
131 - Alcohol is for people who can afford\\
132 - to lose a few brain cells.\\
133 - Yeah? So?\\
134 - I rest my case.\\
135 - What case?\\
136 - * Men.\\
137 - (whistling happily)\\
138 - Morning, buddy.\\
139 - How do you like your eggs?\\
140 - In an Easter basket.\\
141 - Scrambled it is.\\
142 - Morning. Morning.\\
143 - Whatcha doing?\\
144 - Cooking breakfast.\\
145 - How do you like your eggs?\\
146 - Sunny side up.\\
147 - Scrambled it is.\\
148 - Cooking for Dummies.\\
149 - No offense, Jake. I'm actually cookin' for everybody.\\
150 - What brought this on?\\
151 - I Don't know. I...\\
152 - thought I'd expand my horizons a bit.\\
153 - Uh-huh.\\
154 - What?\\
155 - I'm just trying to figure out how scrambled eggs\\
156 - are gonna get you laid.\\
157 - You and me both.\\
158 - (phone ringing)\\
159 - I got it!\\
160 - Hello?\\
161 - Oh! Oh, hi, Stephanie.\\
162 - Yeah, yeah, I, uh, I had a great time, too.\\
163 - Yes, it-it was special.\\
164 - I-I don't usually do that on a first date either.\\
165 - Thank you for letting me do that, by the way.\\
166 - Uh... Uh... Tonight?\\
167 - Uh... Oh, gee. Hey, Alan!\\
168 - How do you like your eggs?\\
169 - Uh, uh, one sec.\\
170 - Charlie, Stephanie wants to see me tonight,\\
171 - but I already made a date with Katie. What do I do?\\
172 - Scrambled it is.\\
173 - Uh, uh, the thing is, uh, I already made plans,\\
174 - uh, with my, uh, you know, son, who I love dearly.\\
175 - What are we doing?\\
176 - Nothing. Go away.\\
177 - Oh, oh, w-what are we doing?\\
178 - Uh, uh, well, he and I have this, uh, this father-son thing\\
179 - uh, where once a week, we...\\
180 - uh, uh... Rent go-karts.\\
181 - Rent go-karts.\\
182 - And, uh... and, uh...\\
183 - Eat pizza.\\
184 - And eat pizza. And, uh...\\
185 - And drink beer.\\
186 - And drink... Go away!\\
187 - Uh... and, and drink, uh, uh, a lot of water,\\
188 - which the body needs to, uh, to stay healthy.\\
189 - Um, anyway, we-we're on for Saturday, right?\\
190 - Uh, okay, uh, uh, great, great.\\
191 - Good. I-I'll see you then.\\
192 - Okay, bye.\\
193 - We're not going go-karting, are we?\\
194 - No.\\
195 - You're using me for your own purposes, aren't you?\\
196 - Here's $20.\\
197 - Hey, Alan.\\
198 - Taste these.\\
199 - Why does it smell like bourbon?\\
200 - The book said "season to taste."\\
201 - Just kidding. I spilled.\\
202 - N-No, thank you.\\
203 - Suit yourself.\\
204 - Hmm...\\
205 - A little too much egg.\\
206 - * Men.\\
207 - Jake, let's go!\\
208 - I told your mother I'd have you back by 7:00.\\
209 - Hey, Alan, Alan, Alan.\\
210 - Would you taste my hollandaise sauce?\\
211 - You made hollandaise sauce?\\
212 - You tell me.\\
213 - You did not make hollandaise sauce.\\
214 - Damn you, eggs Benedict.\\
215 - Charlie, why are you doing this?\\
216 - Doing what?\\
217 - In the six years that I have been living here,\\
218 - the only time I've seen you turn on the stove\\
219 - was to light a cigar.\\
220 - Yeah, well, people grow, people change.\\
221 - People get drunk while watching the Food Network.\\
222 - Jake, let's go!\\
223 - Uh, I may not\\
224 - be back till late-- I'm planning\\
225 - on giving my rose to bachelorette number two.\\
226 - Wow. Only you could gay up bangin' two women.\\
227 - Says the man in the apron\\
228 - with the curdled hollandaise sauce.\\
229 - So you admit it is hollandaise sauce?\\
230 - Mom said you could drop me off at Gabe's house so we can study.\\
231 - Oh. Are you really gonna study?\\
232 - Sure.\\
233 - Great.\\
234 - See that? He respects me enough to lie to me.\\
235 - Hey, Alan.\\
236 - Speaking of lies--\\
237 - at some point,\\
238 - one of these broads is gonna ask you a question\\
239 - for which you will have no ready answer.\\
240 - Like what? Well, it could be\\
241 - as simple as: "What did you do last night?"\\
242 - or as tricky as:\\
243 - "Why is there a pasty stuck to your testicles?"\\
244 - The point is, you need to be careful.\\
245 - So you're gonna teach me how to lie to women?\\
246 - Well, do you know enough to pull the pasty off\\
247 - and say "Happy Anniversary"?\\
248 - I do now.\\
249 - Another thing you need to remember is always answer\\
250 - a question with another question.\\
251 - What do you mean? Exactly.\\
252 - What? Great, you're all set.\\
253 - Drunk again? Yep.\\
254 - Well, thank you. I appreciate the advice.\\
255 - I've got more.\\
256 - Charlie, please don't take this the wrong way,\\
257 - but if a semi-functioning wino, such as yourself,\\
258 - can date several women at the same time,\\
259 - I'm quite certain I can handle two.\\
260 - Why would I take that the wrong way?\\
261 - Ugh! Tastes like stale ass.\\
262 - * Men.\\
263 - Is it just me or does this thing we have\\
264 - feel really, really comfortable?\\
265 - Oh, yeah.\\
266 - I mean, you know,\\
267 - maybe not pet-names- for-our-pee-parts comfortable,\\
268 - but we're certainly getting there.\\
269 - Oh, hey, next week, my ex is taking my daughter\\
270 - to see his parents,\\
271 - so you and I can spend the whole weekend in bed.\\
272 - (chuckling) That-that sounds great.\\
273 - I'll leave myself alone till then.\\
274 - Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait-- uh, uh, next weekend?\\
275 - Uh, you know, uh, I'll have to check,\\
276 - but I-I-I think Saturday is a-a working Saturday for me.\\
277 - Oh, no. Really?\\
278 - Yeah, yeah, it's unfortunate,\\
279 - but in today's economic climate,\\
280 - Saturday is no longer the Sabbath for anybody\\
281 - except perhaps very religious Jewish people.\\
282 - You know, the guys with the beards and the hats?\\
283 - Did you see Yentl? I love that movie.\\
284 - That's one I wouldn't mind owning.\\
285 - Alan, are you seeing another woman?\\
286 - Charlie, are you seeing another woman?\\
287 - Why would you ask me that?\\
288 - I just need to know I can trust you.\\
289 - Yeah, well, trust is a two-way street.\\
290 - I know.\\
291 - Do you?\\
292 - Because without trust, all we have is sex.\\
293 - Well, you can trust me, Charlie.\\
294 - God, I hope so.\\
295 - I've been hurt before.\\
296 - Aw...\\
297 - I won't hurt you. I promise.\\
298 - Okay, then.\\
299 - (scoffing): Another woman?!\\
300 - Yeah.\\
301 - You think I'm involved with another woman?\\
302 - Yeah.\\
303 - You actually think I'm seeing\\
304 - someone else at the same time I'm seeing you?\\
305 - Yeah. How did you know?\\
306 - (phone rings)\\
307 - Do you need to get that?\\
308 - Are you crazy?\\
309 - CHARLIE (on answering machine): Hey, it's Charlie.\\
310 - Do your thing when you hear the beep.\\
311 - (beep)\\
312 - (slurring): Hey, Uncle Charlie, it's me, Jakey.\\
313 - I'm drunk. How are you?\\
314 - Are you with a girl? Does she have big ones?\\
315 - Jake, where are you?\\
316 - What mall?\\
317 - They all have pretzel stands, you doofus.\\
318 - Okay, you stay right where you are,\\
319 - and I'll come get you.\\
320 - We'll talk about that later.\\
321 - (whispers): They're big enough.\\
322 - I love you too, buddy.\\
323 - Yeah, we have shared some good memories.\\
324 - Okay, I'm hanging up now.\\
325 - Do you have to go?\\
326 - No, we got time.\\
327 - * Men.\\
328 - (door opens)\\
329 - What the heck took you so long?\\
330 - Believe me, I came as quickly as I could.\\
331 - What is that?\\
332 - It's a pretzel. You want some?\\
333 - No, thanks.\\
334 - It's got jalapenos!\\
335 - Oh, you're gonna regret that.\\
336 - What do you mean?\\
337 - You'll see.\\
338 - Where'd you get the booze, knucklehead?\\
339 - I did what you told me to do.\\
340 - Me and Gabe gave money to a creepy guy to buy us beer.\\
341 - Oh, Jake.\\
342 - His name was Satellite Jack.\\
343 - He said the government stole his kidneys.\\
344 - Is $20 too much for a six-pack?\\
345 - Not when a guy with no kidneys named Satellite Jack\\
346 - is buying it for you.\\
347 - Where'd you get the $20?\\
348 - It was a bribe from my father.\\
349 - You're kidding.\\
350 - I know.\\
351 - For a cheap guy, he can be surprisingly generous.\\
352 - That's true.\\
353 - Deep down I love him.\\
354 - And I love you, too.\\
355 - Great. Everybody loves everybody.\\
356 - So, where's your friend?\\
357 - Gabe? He ditched me when I started throwing up,\\
358 - the bat rastard.\\
359 - Get out of the car. What?\\
360 - I just had it detailed-- get out, get out, get out.\\
361 - All right, but I'm tellin' ya I'm all done throwin' up.\\
362 - (vomits)\\
363 - I see what you mean about those jalapenos.\\
364 - Listen, my mom still thinks I'm studying at Gabe's house,\\
365 - so I don't think I should go home at this time.\\
366 - What do you expect to do?\\
367 - I don't know. You up for an R-rated movie?\\
368 - Boobies, no violence.\\
369 - Uh-oh.\\
370 - Step away from the car.\\
371 - Nope, false alarm.\\
372 - Wait for it.\\
373 - Wait for what?\\
374 - (vomits)\\
375 - Oh, how about that?\\
376 - You get any on your shoes?\\
377 - A little.\\
378 - There's a plastic bag in the trunk.\\
379 - Remove your shoes and place them in the bag,\\
380 - then seal it and put it back in the trunk.\\
381 - Okay.\\
382 - Then climb in after it.\\
383 - Okay.\\
384 - * Men.\\
385 - Alan?\\
386 - Surprise.\\
387 - I thought you were with your son go-karting.\\
388 - Yeah, listen, um, I lied about that.\\
389 - But I can't lie anymore.\\
390 - I was with another woman, but all I could think about was you.\\
391 - I'm a one-woman man and, baby, you're that woman.\\
392 - MAN: Who is it, honey?\\
393 - Just a salesman. (whispers): Go away.\\
394 - Wait a minute-- are you seeing someone else? Get lost!\\
395 - (stammering): I-I thought we had something special.\\
396 - Who's in there?!\\
397 - Are you married?\\
398 - Because I really thought...\\
399 - (vomiting)\\
400 - You know, your body's sending you a message.\\
401 - Yeah, it's sayin' I really should chew my food more.\\
402 - Look at that shrimp.\\
403 - You could wash it off and serve it again.\\
404 - Your body is also telling you that alcohol is poison.\\
405 - If it's poison, why do you drink it?\\
406 - Because there are things inside of me I need to kill.\\
407 - You can't kill bad feelings with alcohol, Uncle Charlie.\\
408 - Right.\\
409 - And you can't stuff your emotions with cupcakes.\\
410 - Believe me, I've tried.\\
411 - I'm sure you have.\\
412 - And if you ever need to talk about any of this stuff,\\
413 - I'm here for you. (vomits)\\
414 - Good to know.\\
415 - Whoa, felt that one in my nuts.\\
416 - ALAN: Hello? Anybody home?\\
417 - Are you gonna rat me out?\\
418 - Jake, buddy, how could you even ask me that?\\
419 - Hey, what's goin' on?\\
420 - Jake took the 20 bucks you gave him\\
421 - and got drunk with a friend.\\
422 - Oh.\\
423 - Bad boy.\\
424 - So...\\
425 - how 'bout a beer?\\
426 - * Men.\\
427 - Never... again.\\
428 - Me neither.\\
429 - You know what the problem is?\\
430 - The women, the drinking...\\
431 - You guys look at me and you think it's easy.\\
432 - But what you don't see is all the years of hard work\\
433 - and dedication it took to make me the happy-go-lucky,\\
434 - drunken, ass-wrangler I am today.\\
435 - WOMAN: Charlie?\\
436 - Oh, sorry, baby, I had a little family drama.\\
437 - Remember, you said if I gave you what you want,\\
438 - you'd give me what I want.\\
439 - Oh, right-- breakfast in bed.\\
440 - How do you like your eggs?\\
441 - Scrambled.\\
442 - (softly): Yes!\\
443 - You know, young man,\\
444 - if I hadn't have been electrocuted earlier this evening,\\
445 - you and I'd be having a serious talk right now.\\
446 - Yeah. Hold on.\\
447 - (vomiting repeatedly)\\
448 - * Men.
\subsection {Episode 04: The Flavin' and the Mavin'}
1 - I really appreciate you getting up so early\\
2 - and driving me to work.\\
3 - I owe you one.\\
4 - You owed me one\\
5 - when I didn't smother you in your crib.\\
6 - Well, then, I owe you two.\\
7 - My car will be out of the shop in a couple of days.\\
8 - There was a terrible knock in the engine.\\
9 - Like a... like a...\\
10 - (imitating knocking)\\
11 - I kept saying, "Come in," but nobody did.\\
12 - (chuckling)\\
13 - Ooh, carpool lane-- that's us.\\
14 - We could... Shut up.\\
15 - Right.\\
16 - It's 7:00.\\
17 - Where are all these damn people going?\\
18 - I know, right?\\
19 - I deal with that every day.\\
20 - Very frustrating.\\
21 - Sometimes I dream about buying a cabin in the woods\\
22 - and just getting away...\\
23 - I said shut up. Yes, you did.\\
24 - The people going that way should just switch jobs\\
25 - with the people going this way,\\
26 - and everybody can leave their freaking cars in the garage.\\
27 - (chuckles)\\
28 - You know, that's a... that's a hell of an idea.\\
29 - Right on.\\
30 - Don't patronize me.\\
31 - Sorry.\\
32 - Wait a minute.\\
33 - How are you getting back to Malibu?\\
34 - Uh, I... I was, uh...\\
35 - I was hoping... No.\\
36 - Charlie. Take the bus.\\
37 - There's no bus from Tarzana to Malibu.\\
38 - Then, take a series of buses.\\
39 - And don't get stuck on having to end up in Malibu.\\
40 - Charlie, come on. It...\\
41 - it's just for a couple of days.\\
42 - That's what Mom said\\
43 - when she brought you home from the hospital.\\
44 - (chuckling)\\
45 - Good one.\\
46 - (imitating Stan Laurel): You're a very funny man, Ollie.\\
47 - You certainly are.\\
48 - It's Laurel and Hardy.\\
49 - Boy, they used to...\\
50 - they used to get in some wacky jams, huh?\\
51 - (laughing)\\
52 - What about, uh... uh, Abbott and Costello?\\
53 - (imitating Costello): "Hey, Abbott!"\\
54 - Or, uh... or, uh, Martin and Lewis?\\
55 - (imitating Jerry Lewis): "Hey, lady, with the flavin' and the mavin' and the wow."\\
56 - Three Stooges?\\
57 - (imitating Curly) "Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck."\\
58 - (laughing)\\
59 - ALAN: Whoa, what... why are we stopping?\\
60 - (punches landing) Ow! Ow! Ow!\\
61 - "Oh, a wise guy"... ow!\\
62 - Okay, I don't mind\\
63 - the good-natured brotherly punching,\\
64 - but you did not have to twist my nipples.\\
65 - You're lucky I didn't rip them off\\
66 - and feed them to you.\\
67 - Um, you know, if you...\\
68 - if you really have to go to the bathroom, there's, uh...\\
69 - there's one right down the hallway.\\
70 - What's wrong with the one in your office?\\
71 - Uh, it's not really for guests.\\
72 - Neither is my house.\\
73 - Um, you know, I think we're out of paper towels.\\
74 - I'll wipe my hands on you.\\
75 - Get out of the way.\\
76 - Morning, Dr. Harper.\\
77 - Morning, Melissa.\\
78 - Hello, Melissa.\\
79 - You rat bastard.\\
80 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
81 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
82 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
83 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
84 - Good to know.\\
85 - Hi, I'm Charlie, Alan's brother.\\
86 - Nice to meet you.\\
87 - Nice to meet you, too.\\
88 - Thought you had to tinkle. Go away.\\
89 - So, how long you been working for my baby brother?\\
90 - About six months.\\
91 - Wow, he's been keeping you a secret\\
92 - for six months?\\
93 - Charlie, can I talk to you for a minute?\\
94 - There's no reason to thank me\\
95 - for the ride again, Alan.\\
96 - Mi Mercedes, su Mercedes.\\
97 - It's what brothers do\\
98 - when one is vastly more fortunate than the other.\\
99 - Seriously, we need to talk.\\
100 - Excuse us.\\
101 - Charlie, she is the best receptionist I have ever had.\\
102 - I'm hoping to say the same.\\
103 - Come on, Charlie, please do not crap where I work.\\
104 - Hey, you crap where I live.\\
105 - So tell me about her.\\
106 - There's nothing to tell.\\
107 - She's a... she's a terrific employee.\\
108 - She does my scheduling, my books.\\
109 - My patients love her.\\
110 - She keeps the whole operation running like clockwork,\\
111 - and she does it all for crappy pay and no benefits.\\
112 - So you're not hitting that?\\
113 - No, I'm not hitting that.\\
114 - And even if I were hitting that,\\
115 - I wouldn't use the phrase, "hitting that."\\
116 - It's a violent image for a beautiful act.\\
117 - Yeah, yeah... so the coast is clear?\\
118 - No, the coast is not clear.\\
119 - The coast is foggy\\
120 - and strewn with dangerously pointy rocks.\\
121 - Can I get either of you a cup of coffee?\\
122 - Sure. No.\\
123 - No for both of us.\\
124 - Please leave.\\
125 - All right.\\
126 - Bye, Melissa.\\
127 - Bye, Charlie.\\
128 - Hope I see you again.\\
129 - Oh, you'll see me tonight\\
130 - when I come back to pick up your boss.\\
131 - Oh, oh, no, Charlie, Charlie,\\
132 - you don't have to make that long drive.\\
133 - I'll take the bus.\\
134 - I thought there were no buses.\\
135 - If I have to, I'll charter one.\\
136 - Why don't I just give you a ride home?\\
137 - Oh, that is so sweet of you.\\
138 - You got a real gem here, Alan.\\
139 - Tell you what, when you get him home,\\
140 - there will be a cold margarita waiting for you out on my deck.\\
141 - Which overlooks the ocean.\\
142 - On the beach.\\
143 - In Malibu.\\
144 - That sounds wonderful.\\
145 - It's really not: it's chilly, damp,\\
146 - and covered with pelican poop.\\
147 - That's why he'll never win the Malibu slogan contest.\\
148 - (laughing)\\
149 - See you tonight, Melissa.\\
150 - Bye, Charlie.\\
151 - Have a great day, bro.\\
152 - I hate you. I hate you, too.\\
153 - Gee, your brother is really cute.\\
154 - As a bug.\\
155 - Bathroom?\\
156 - Oh, let me give you the key.\\
157 - Thank you.\\
158 - You're very welcome.\\
159 - You are a doll.\\
160 - You are cute.\\
161 - She's actually a doll.\\
162 - I wonder if she's anatomically correct.\\
163 - * Men.\\
164 - (Melissa giggling loudly)\\
165 - Yeah.\\
166 - Who's the Smurf?\\
167 - The Smurf is my receptionist.\\
168 - You're letting Charlie hit that?\\
169 - Okay, look, first of all, that is a very ugly phrase.\\
170 - And second of all, I'm not letting him.\\
171 - I mean, short of drugging him\\
172 - and dumping him in the woods, what can I do? Yeah.\\
173 - He is like an Alabama bloodhound once he gets a whiff.\\
174 - (Melissa giggling)\\
175 - Now it's just a matter\\
176 - of waiting until it blows up in my face.\\
177 - And after it blows up in my face,\\
178 - it will then circle around and bite me in the ass.\\
179 - That's me.\\
180 - No face, no ass.\\
181 - Well, that's what you get\\
182 - when you mix work and personal.\\
183 - Which is why me and Charlie\\
184 - have always kept everything strictly professional.\\
185 - Yeah, yeah, I've often wondered about that.\\
186 - When I first started to work here,\\
187 - I laid down the law: looky, no touchy.\\
188 - Yipes.\\
189 - All right, I'll make you another,\\
190 - but you got to promise not to chug this one.\\
191 - Promise!\\
192 - What a fun gal.\\
193 - Charlie, do you know how hard it is\\
194 - to find a decent receptionist?\\
195 - Well, kudos, bro, you did a great job.\\
196 - Thank you, and I-I really don't want to lose her.\\
197 - Why would you lose her?\\
198 - Oh, gee, I don't know.\\
199 - Maybe because my brother intends\\
200 - to defile and discard her like a warm melon.\\
201 - A warm melon?\\
202 - Nothing.\\
203 - Anyway, my point is\\
204 - that you're gonna leave her with bad memories\\
205 - that can only be erased by removing herself\\
206 - from anything that reminds her of you-- like me.\\
207 - Is that what you're worried about, Bunky?\\
208 - Yes, that's what I'm worried about.\\
209 - What did you think I was worried about?\\
210 - What else would I be worried about?\\
211 - Well, let's see.\\
212 - Your receding hairline, your semi-literate son,\\
213 - your budding man-boobs.\\
214 - But that's just off the top of my head.\\
215 - Charlie, please, I am begging you.\\
216 - Look, I understand your concerns,\\
217 - but it's not like that.\\
218 - I think Melissa is terrific.\\
219 - You always think they're terrific.\\
220 - They're terrific before.\\
221 - They're terrific during.\\
222 - It's the after when the crying\\
223 - and the quitting start.\\
224 - Why is it always about you?\\
225 - Aren't I entitled to some happiness?\\
226 - You've had your share of happiness.\\
227 - You've had your share of happiness,\\
228 - my share, everybody's share.\\
229 - You've sucked the marrow of happiness from the...\\
230 - bones of...\\
231 - Oh, just leave her alone, won't you?\\
232 - Alan, you don't have to worry.\\
233 - You're thinking about the old Charlie,\\
234 - the old-hump-'em- and-dump-'em,\\
235 - one-track-mind Charlie.\\
236 - Oh, oh, right, uh, the old Charlie\\
237 - from way back this morning.\\
238 - I'm serious.\\
239 - I honestly want to start building a relationship.\\
240 - Really? Yeah.\\
241 - Get to know someone, let her get to know me,\\
242 - have something in common before we jump into bed.\\
243 - Wow, I'm impressed.\\
244 - That I'm growing up?\\
245 - No, that you can so easily lie to my face.\\
246 - You'll see.\\
247 - It's gonna be different with Melissa.\\
248 - I'm gonna take my time, form a friendship,\\
249 - bond emotionally, and then and only then,\\
250 - take it to the next level.\\
251 - (box springs squeaking)\\
252 - MELISSA: Oh, Charlie!\\
253 - You schmuck.\\
254 - * Men.\\
255 - Morning, Dr. Harper.\\
256 - Morning.\\
257 - I like\\
258 - your jammies.\\
259 - Thank you, I, uh, I like your...\\
260 - thank you.\\
261 - Guess you're kind of surprised to see me, huh?\\
262 - Yeah, shocked.\\
263 - Well, I hope you know\\
264 - it is not the kind of thing I usually do--\\
265 - you know, hop into bed with a fella zippity-quick.\\
266 - It's really none of my business.\\
267 - Well, I don't.\\
268 - But Charlie is so sweet and special.\\
269 - Yep, he's a treasure.\\
270 - Yeah, and this works out well for you.\\
271 - Really? Uh, how do you figure?\\
272 - Since your car is still in the shop,\\
273 - we can carpool to and from work.\\
274 - I see.\\
275 - So, so you'll be coming back?\\
276 - Oh, yeah.\\
277 - Charlie asked me to stay the weekend.\\
278 - No kidding. Yeppers.\\
279 - We really made a connection...\\
280 - and it is not just physical.\\
281 - Although the physical part is amazing.\\
282 - Again, none of my business.\\
283 - It is like I have known him all my life.\\
284 - I know the feeling.\\
285 - You get over it.\\
286 - Hey, baby.\\
287 - Hey yourself.\\
288 - Mmm.\\
289 - Do I smell toast?\\
290 - You do.\\
291 - Would you like a slice?\\
292 - I can put butter and jelly on it.\\
293 - Oh, d  j   vu. (yelps)\\
294 - Stop it. You're terrible.\\
295 - Whoo!\\
296 - (giggles, clears throat)\\
297 - Sorry, Dr. Harper.\\
298 - That's okay. I wasn't even listening.\\
299 - I'm going to take a shower.\\
300 - Hit the road in about 20 minutes?\\
301 - I thought you were going to call in sick.\\
302 - Shush.\\
303 - He's kidding.\\
304 - It's okay. 20 minutes is fine.\\
305 - Great.\\
306 - (sighs)\\
307 - Alan, you know me as a cynical man,\\
308 - but in just one night\\
309 - that little pixie has melted this cold, lonely heart.\\
310 - You don't say.\\
311 - You may not believe me,\\
312 - but there is something going on here,\\
313 - and I really want to thank you for bringing her into my life.\\
314 - I may not believe you?\\
315 - You know what?\\
316 - Fine. Think what you want.\\
317 - Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go play\\
318 - "Paul Bunyan takes a shower in Tiny Town."\\
319 - * Men.\\
320 - Sorry we're running late.\\
321 - That's all right.\\
322 - Shower lasted a bit longer than I planned.\\
323 - Yeah, well, uh, that happens.\\
324 - I got to tell you, I am just crazy about your brother.\\
325 - Swell.\\
326 - Hope it works out.\\
327 - How is a guy like that still single?\\
328 - Well, he's always been a bit of a butterfly, you know,\\
329 - fluttering through life, hard to pin down.\\
330 - And being a fall-down drunk is kind of a speed bump\\
331 - for some of the ladies.\\
332 - (laughing): You're such a jokester, Dr. Harper.\\
333 - (chuckles)\\
334 - Either that or put a gun in my mouth.\\
335 - Oh, listen, on the way home tonight,\\
336 - we have to swing by my apartment\\
337 - so I can get some clothes for the weekend.\\
338 - Mm-hmm.\\
339 - And I'm gonna need a little extra time for lunch today.\\
340 - I want to buy some sexy lingerie... for you know.\\
341 - I do.\\
342 - Can I pick you up anything?\\
343 - Yeah, yeah, um, ear plugs would be nice,\\
344 - um, and that gun I mentioned.\\
345 - Nothing special.\\
346 - I'm only going to use it just the once.\\
347 - (giggling)\\
348 - Oh.\\
349 - * Men.\\
350 - (doorbell rings)\\
351 - Hi, Jake.\\
352 - Hey, got to hit the crapper.\\
353 - You must be Judith.\\
354 - I'm sorry. Do I know you?\\
355 - I'm Melissa, Dr. Harper's receptionist.\\
356 - We talk on the phone all the time.\\
357 - Oh, right, Melissa.\\
358 - It's so nice to finally meet you.\\
359 - Alan!\\
360 - Oh, oh, hey, hey, hi, uh, hi, Judith, this is Melissa.\\
361 - Melissa, Judith.\\
362 - It's not what it looks like.\\
363 - Charlie's doing her, not me.\\
364 - And, uh, where is Charlie anyway?\\
365 - Taking a nap.\\
366 - He says I drain him.\\
367 - Isn't that adorable?\\
368 - Adorable, disturbing, whatever.\\
369 - Uh, thanks, I've got this.\\
370 - Your brother and your receptionist? (sighs)\\
371 - What do you want from me? Th-The Volvo's in the shop,\\
372 - he twisted my nipples and peed in my office.\\
373 - What?\\
374 - I'm not thrilled about this either,\\
375 - but what can I do?\\
376 - You could think about the effect\\
377 - these shenanigans have on your adolescent son.\\
378 - Okay, you know what, Judith?\\
379 - I have enough problems.\\
380 - If you're not comfortable leaving Jake here\\
381 - for the weekend, then take him home.\\
382 - Nice try, Alan.\\
383 - * Men.\\
384 - You think Uncle Charlie and Melissa\\
385 - are coming down for lunch?\\
386 - I doubt it.\\
387 - Can I have their chicken?\\
388 - Knock yourself out.\\
389 - You know how you always say I can ask you anything?\\
390 - Yeah?\\
391 - Is them being together weird for you?\\
392 - No, no.\\
393 - Well, you're a better man than I.\\
394 - How so?\\
395 - Well, you remember when Uncle Charlie\\
396 - was hittin' my fifth grade teacher? Okay...\\
397 - can we please stop calling it "hittin'"?\\
398 - Well, I got another word,\\
399 - but I don't think you're going to like it.\\
400 - Fine, fine, then I, uh, I do remember\\
401 - when he was... hitting your fifth grade teacher.\\
402 - That kind of bugged me.\\
403 - Well, I'm, I'm sorry.\\
404 - I mean, don't you think there should be boundaries?\\
405 - I do think that.\\
406 - But I thought you said it's not weird\\
407 - that he's hittin' your receptionist.\\
408 - Ah, uh, w... uh, well, pal, um,\\
409 - the thing is, um, Daddy lied.\\
410 - Oh, then it is weird for you?\\
411 - Yes, yes, it is weird for me.\\
412 - Are you jealous? Uh, no, no.\\
413 - 'Cause I was a little bit jealous about Miss Pasternak.\\
414 - She had a rockin' bod.\\
415 - Eat your chicken.\\
416 - * Men.\\
417 - Melissa?\\
418 - We, uh, need to get a move on.\\
419 - A lot of traffic what with the rain and all.\\
420 - CHARLIE: We need a minute, Alan.\\
421 - Oh, God.\\
422 - What can they do in a minute that they didn't do all weekend?\\
423 - MELISSA: You are just a selfish son of a bitch\\
424 - and you can go right to hell!\\
425 - (sobbing)\\
426 - Sorry, Dr. Harper.\\
427 - I'll be in the car.\\
428 - Well...\\
429 - that could have gone better.\\
430 - I knew it.\\
431 - I thought it might take longer than 48 hours, but I knew it.\\
432 - Hey, hey, hey.\\
433 - A little sensitivity would be appreciated.\\
434 - I'm hurting here.\\
435 - I'm sure a lot of that is friction burn.\\
436 - Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
437 - Where does that come from?\\
438 - (scoffing): Where does it come from?\\
439 - It comes from a long history\\
440 - of you using my life as a specimen cup.\\
441 - Excuse me, but you're still talking about the old Charlie.\\
442 - This Charlie was hoping to have a relationship\\
443 - of substance and depth.\\
444 - By locking a stranger in your room and hittin' it\\
445 - for two days straight?\\
446 - Okay, mea culpa.\\
447 - Change is hard.\\
448 - And now that I'm hearing it, I agree with you.\\
449 - "Hittin' it" is an ugly term.\\
450 - Don't change the subject.\\
451 - What happened? Nothing.\\
452 - (gargles, spits)\\
453 - I just said to her that maybe we should slow things down,\\
454 - see other people.\\
455 - Wait, y-y-you said this after the two days?\\
456 - How could I know beforehand?\\
457 - I thought you'd be happy.\\
458 - You didn't want me to go out with her in the first place.\\
459 - Yes, but it's no longer the first place.\\
460 - It's the last place.\\
461 - What can I tell you, Alan?\\
462 - I made a mistake.\\
463 - I rushed to love.\\
464 - No, no, your mistake was\\
465 - you rushed to love my receptionist,\\
466 - the woman who I depend upon to run my business.\\
467 - Oh, she's a good kid.\\
468 - She'll get over it.\\
469 - (horn honking repeatedly)\\
470 - You hear that? You hear that?\\
471 - Does that sound like a woman who's getting over it?\\
472 - Well, Alan, the wounds are fresh.\\
473 - You're going to need to be patient.\\
474 - Why should I have to be patient?\\
475 - Well, you have to work with her.\\
476 - (horn honking)\\
477 - And it sounds like you'd better get going.\\
478 - Sure you don't want to come back to my office\\
479 - and hump my fax machine?\\
480 - Wow.\\
481 - You still have a fax machine?\\
482 - You're despicable.\\
483 - Alan, wait.\\
484 - What? Let me make it up to you.\\
485 - How could you possibly make it up to me?\\
486 - Well, I'm guessing she won't be inclined\\
487 - to bring you back here tonight.\\
488 - So why don't you take a cab and I'll pay for it?\\
489 - Thanks.\\
490 - That makes up for everything.\\
491 - I'm talking cab, not Town Car.\\
492 - (sighing): Oh, man.\\
493 - Break-ups are so hard.\\
494 - Ow.\\
495 - Huh.\\
496 - I do have a little friction burn.\\
497 - * Men.\\
498 - That miserable son of a bitch.\\
499 - Might want to extend your brake zone on the wet roads.\\
500 - I'm so stupid. No, no, no, no, you are not stupid.\\
501 - You're, you're a dear, sweet, remarkably bright...\\
502 - Truck, truck-- watch out for the truck.\\
503 - Watch out for the truck.\\
504 - (shrieking)\\
505 - I want a raise. Sure, sure.\\
506 - And health insurance. That's a given.\\
507 - I-I can't believe you don't have it already.\\
508 - And a paid vacation.\\
509 - Well, now, hang on a second. There's only so mu...\\
510 - (shrieking): Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks!\\
511 - * Men.
\subsection {Episode 05: A Jock Strap in Hell}
1 - all this time without a jockstrap.\\
2 - I don't like it.\\
3 - It feels like I'm flossing my butt crack.\\
4 - Based on what I'm paying your dentist,\\
5 - you know nothing about flossing.\\
6 - Think of it as a bra for your balls.\\
7 - Oh, now I want one.\\
8 - What size are you?\\
9 - How should I know?\\
10 - I think they have one of those measuring things.\\
11 - You know, like at the shoe store.\\
12 - Length, width.\\
13 - He's kidding, right?\\
14 - Yes, he's joking,\\
15 - Don't do that.\\
16 - Here, "teen."\\
17 - Think you can fit your junk into that?\\
18 - I'll make it fit. Let's just go.\\
19 - No, no, put it on over your pants. We'll take a look.\\
20 - The heck you will.\\
21 - Charlie, you're embarrassing him.\\
22 - Of course I am.\\
23 - That's why I came.\\
24 - Oh, sorry, sorry. Excuse me.\\
25 - Charlie Harper?\\
26 - Where? He owes me money.\\
27 - Miss Pasternak?\\
28 - Jake! Wow, look at you.\\
29 - Look how much you've grown.\\
30 - I reached puberty.\\
31 - Oh, right, Miss Pasternak, fifth grade,\\
32 - Woodward Avenue Elementary School.\\
33 - Oh, yeah, Miss Pasternak!\\
34 - Oh, yeah, Miss Pasternak.\\
35 - So, are you still teaching?\\
36 - No. No, I'm not.\\
37 - How are you, Charlie?\\
38 - Good, good. Nice to see you. Long time.\\
39 - You look terrific. Guess who's wearing a jock.\\
40 - Oh, how nice.\\
41 - Well, it's great to see you all.\\
42 - Good-bye.\\
43 - Bye, Miss Pasternak.\\
44 - Dodged a bullet there.\\
45 - I'll say.\\
46 - She was kind of shook up after I broke it off with her.\\
47 - Kind of shook up?\\
48 - She went bananas and bit the gym teacher.\\
49 - Where?\\
50 - In the gym.\\
51 - You miserable son of a bitch!\\
52 - I gave you my heart, I gave you my soul,\\
53 - I gave you my body and you just threw me aside\\
54 - like I was some piece of garbage!\\
55 - Yeah, my bad.\\
56 - So, what's new?\\
57 - Oh, you want to catch up?\\
58 - Yeah, sure, let's catch up.\\
59 - Let's see, um, well, okay, after you dumped me,\\
60 - I had a nervous breakdown.\\
61 - Well, it sure looks like you bounced back.\\
62 - And then after my breakdown,\\
63 - I got fired and blackballed from teaching.\\
64 - Oh... bummer.\\
65 - So, what are you up to now?\\
66 - I'll tell you what I'm up to now.\\
67 - I lost my house, I'm living in a cheap motel,\\
68 - and my new career is giving lap dances to strangers\\
69 - while I'm swinging by my crotch on a pole eight times a night.\\
70 - Have you considered an athletic supporter?\\
71 - Okay, well, thanks for the update.\\
72 - Nice seeing you.\\
73 - (hushed): Move, move, move.\\
74 - You ruined my life, Charlie Harper!\\
75 - Righto. Bye.\\
76 - We didn't pay for the jockstrap. Just keep walking.\\
77 - How can you live with yourself, you horrible evil man?!\\
78 - He drinks.\\
79 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
80 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
81 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
82 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
83 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
84 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
85 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
86 - We're making an apple and sugar mixture...\\
87 - What are you watching?\\
88 - The Food Network.\\
89 - I'm learning how\\
90 - to prepare a cinnamon-apple cobbler.\\
91 - Tired of being at the mercy of the dealers, huh?\\
92 - What?\\
93 - Nothing, nothing.\\
94 - Listen, I think I owe you an apology.\\
95 - For what?\\
96 - You know, this morning in the drugstore?\\
97 - Oh, yeah, the jockstrap jokes.\\
98 - You shou be sorry.\\
99 - No, not the jockstrap jokes.\\
100 - Those were funny. I stand by those.\\
101 - I meant the run-in with your old teacher.\\
102 - You probably shouldn't have seen that.\\
103 - I've seen worse.\\
104 - Remember the Pilates instructor who threw\\
105 - the lit road flare through your bedroom window?\\
106 - Yeah. That was awesome.\\
107 - That's one word for it.\\
108 - Oh, and remember the dental hygienist\\
109 - who shot your ass up full of Novocain?\\
110 - I do.\\
111 - That was so funny.\\
112 - You kept falling off the toilet.\\
113 - Yeah, good times.\\
114 - What do you do that gets these women so pissed off at you?\\
115 - It's hard to say exactly.\\
116 - I guess when a guy has an intimate relationship...\\
117 - Oh, remember the girl from the tanning salon\\
118 - who tried to shoot you with a bow and arrow?\\
119 - Yeah, Jake.\\
120 - My point is, I was wrong in the way I treated those women,\\
121 - and you should learn a lesson from my mistakes.\\
122 - You mean like keep a fire extinguisher by your bed?\\
123 - Sure, that's one lesson.\\
124 - And whenever a dental hygienist drops a quarter,\\
125 - never bend over to pick it up?\\
126 - Yeah, that, too.\\
127 - And never go to a Halloween party\\
128 - with a girl dressed as Robin Hood?\\
129 - The thing is, Jake,\\
130 - you wouldn't have to learn any of these lessons\\
131 - if you always treated women better in the first place.\\
132 - I'm confused. If I don't have to learn them,\\
133 - why are you bothering me with them?\\
134 - I don't know.\\
135 - I'm sorry to take up your valuable time.\\
136 - What the heck was that all about?\\
137 - * Men. *\\
138 - Hey. Guess what?\\
139 - Turns out my kid's jockstrap is too small.\\
140 - Good news, eh?\\
141 - Yeah, terrific.\\
142 - Alan, let me ask you something.\\
143 - Do you think I'm a horrible, evil person?\\
144 - Yes.\\
145 - What? You are.\\
146 - Thanks a lot.\\
147 - Well, you know, not intentionally evil.\\
148 - I mean, you know,\\
149 - is a tornado evil when it picks up a mobile home\\
150 - and flings it into an orphanage?\\
151 - Is a shark evil\\
152 - when it eats some poor schmuck on a boogie board?\\
153 - Is a flesh-eating virus evil when it attacks...?\\
154 - I get it, I get it, I get it.\\
155 - I'm a malevolent force of nature.\\
156 - Pretty much.\\
157 - Is this about what happened with Jake's old teacher today?\\
158 - She said that I ruined her life.\\
159 - Well, she did choose to sleep with you.\\
160 - How much of a life could she have had in the first place?\\
161 - Don't try to make me feel better.\\
162 - Because of me, the woman lost her teaching career,\\
163 - and now she's dancing in this skeevy club in Van Nuys\\
164 - and living in some fleabag motel.\\
165 - How do you know what club she works at?\\
166 - The clubs have Web sites, the Web sites have pictures.\\
167 - It's not rocket science.\\
168 - Her dancing name is Desiree Bush.\\
169 - Certainly more colorful than Delores Pasternak.\\
170 - And presidential to boot.\\
171 - I gotta tell you, I'm feeling a little guilty.\\
172 - Does that surprise you?\\
173 - No, what surprises me is the liquor isn't helping.\\
174 - It just beads up on the guilt and rolls right off it.\\
175 - Oh, come on, this can't be the first woman\\
176 - who had a nervous breakdown,\\
177 - lost her job and wound up taking her clothes off\\
178 - for horny strangers because of you.\\
179 - Of course not.\\
180 - But it's never bothered me before.\\
181 - Well, maybe you're finally\\
182 - developing a conscience.\\
183 - At long last realizing that your actions have consequences\\
184 - for other people.\\
185 - Don't talk down to me, Jiminy Cricket.\\
186 - Sorry.\\
187 - But you're right.\\
188 - I do need to take responsibility for the damage I've caused.\\
189 - Where you going?\\
190 - Where else? Strip club.\\
191 - Wait up. I'll drive.\\
192 - * Men. *\\
193 - ("Cherry Pie" playing)\\
194 - Good Lord, she's quite the gymnast.\\
195 - I know. I never understood why this isn't in the Olympics\\
196 - and synchronized diving is.\\
197 - Hey, honey, when's Miss Bush come out?\\
198 - Whenever Ben Franklin comes out.\\
199 - I mean Desiree Bush.\\
200 - She's around here somewhere.\\
201 - Thank you.\\
202 - How come she's not taking her clothes off?\\
203 - Because this is a bikini club.\\
204 - What's a bikini club?\\
205 - Hard liquor, no nipples.\\
206 - Man, I could've stayed home and seen no nipples.\\
207 - Hey, there she is.\\
208 - Miss Pasternak.\\
209 - What the hell are you doing here?\\
210 - I just wanted to talk to you.\\
211 - Yeah, well, I'm working, so unless you want\\
212 - a private dance, I got no time.\\
213 - I don't need a dance. Then you get lost.\\
214 - No, no, wait, wait, wait.\\
215 - Alan needs a dance.\\
216 - Oh, no, I don't, I-I...\\
217 - I'm buying.\\
218 - Do you mind if I take my belt off?\\
219 - So anyway, I just wanted to tell you\\
220 - that I'm really sorry for the way that I ended it,\\
221 - and if there's anything I can do\\
222 - to make it right, just let me now.\\
223 - (groans deeply)\\
224 - What can you do for me, Charlie?\\
225 - Well, maybe I can help you get back on your feet.\\
226 - Oh, oh, not yet, not yet.\\
227 - Are you gonna get me my house back?\\
228 - Are you gonna do that?\\
229 - Ooh, doggies!\\
230 - Well, no.\\
231 - My parents have disowned me.\\
232 - Are you gonna fix that relationship?\\
233 - I'm not real good with parents.\\
234 - Uh, excuse me, I've gotta, I've gotta readjust.\\
235 - I'm playing ring toss with my car keys.\\
236 - What then? Are you gonna get me my teacher's license back?\\
237 - I wish I could.\\
238 - Okay, I'm all set. We can continue.\\
239 - Alan, this doesn't concern you.\\
240 - At this point, it kinda does.\\
241 - Come on, hop on Pop.\\
242 - Thank you!\\
243 - What if there was a way for you to go back to teaching\\
244 - that didn't require a license?\\
245 - What are you talking about?\\
246 - Private tutoring for a special-needs child.\\
247 - Oh, oh, Charlie, don't drag him into this.\\
248 - Why not?\\
249 - She's a good teacher, and if his grades go any lower,\\
250 - we'll have to start renting him out as a speed bump.\\
251 - Tutoring?\\
252 - Yeah, I don't know.\\
253 - I'll match what you're making here.\\
254 - Is it okay with you, Alan?\\
255 - Oh, yes, yes, yes!\\
256 - Okay, it's a deal.\\
257 - Oh, thank you, thank you.\\
258 - Now come on, teach.\\
259 - I'll buy you a drink and we'll toast your new career.\\
260 - (laughs): Great.\\
261 - Uh, uh... O-O-Okay.\\
262 - I'll, uh, I'll catch up with you guys later.\\
263 - Where's my belt?\\
264 - * Men. *\\
265 - Let me get this straight.\\
266 - She was his fifth grade teacher,\\
267 - and then she became a stripper because you dumped her,\\
268 - and now she's his tutor because you felt guilty?\\
269 - Pretty much.\\
270 - And you approved?\\
271 - He caught me at a weak moment.\\
272 - Well, who am I to judge?\\
273 - I almost traded one of my kids for a riding lawn mower.\\
274 - I'm sorry, but I'm still confused.\\
275 - Oh, boy.\\
276 - Hm. Okay, um...\\
277 - let's look at it this way.\\
278 - How about if you make $40 a dance.\\
279 - If you want to find out how much you can earn per hour,\\
280 - you have to solve fortimes 40,\\
281 - X being the number of dances you can do in an hour.\\
282 - What about tips?\\
283 - That's a variable.\\
284 - Oh. I get it-- so the money\\
285 - you kick back to the house is...\\
286 - The constant! The constant!\\
287 - Good for you.\\
288 - That's a good start.\\
289 - Yeah, it was. You make learning fun.\\
290 - (laughs): Where you going?\\
291 - Take a shower.\\
292 - Guys, we're done!\\
293 - Hey. So, how'd it go?\\
294 - Oh, a little slow.\\
295 - He's not exactly the quicker picker upper.\\
296 - Well, that's why he needs you.\\
297 - He's kind of an idiot.\\
298 - Yeah, uh,\\
299 - I wasn't gonna say anything, but wow.\\
300 - So, we'll see you tomorrow, then?\\
301 - Great. Hey...\\
302 - Charlie, thank you.\\
303 - For what?\\
304 - Well, you've given me back\\
305 - something I lost a long time ago.\\
306 - I gave it back?\\
307 - How did I give it back?\\
308 - My self-respect.\\
309 - Oh, sure, that you can get back.\\
310 - And you haven't even tried to hit on me.\\
311 - No. And I don't intend to.\\
312 - I just want to see you get your life together again.\\
313 - Boy, I've hated you for so many years.\\
314 - I'm starting to think maybe I was wrong.\\
315 - No, no, no, you're were right-- this is new for me.\\
316 - Well, I like this Charlie.\\
317 - He's got a big heart.\\
318 - Thank you.\\
319 - Desiree, wait.\\
320 - Instead of going back to that motel,\\
321 - why don't you stay here?\\
322 - No strings-- just until you can get a real apartment.\\
323 - Where would I sleep?\\
324 - You can have the guest room.\\
325 - Well, where would Alan sleep?\\
326 - If there was any justice, at the bottom of a ravine.\\
327 - * Men. *\\
328 - I can't believe you gave her my room.\\
329 - I can't believe you're still calling it your room.\\
330 - How long is this gonna last?\\
331 - Just until she gets back on her feet.\\
332 - Oh, please, that's a load of crap.\\
333 - That's what I said to you six years ago.\\
334 - You've been here six years?\\
335 - I'll just go make up the couch.\\
336 - (quietly): Story of my life.\\
337 - No boner goes unpunished.\\
338 - * Men. *\\
339 - (door opens)\\
340 - Charlie.\\
341 - Huh?\\
342 - I was lying in bed alone, and I had an epiphany.\\
343 - Okay.\\
344 - It suddenly became clear to me why you came back into my life.\\
345 - Why?\\
346 - The Lord sent you.\\
347 - The Lord?\\
348 - Yes. He sent you to save me from my sinful ways.\\
349 - He did? Yes.\\
350 - I really don't think he'd send me.\\
351 - I'm more of a recruiter for the other side.\\
352 - It's not for us to question his will.\\
353 - Come, come, let's pray together.\\
354 - Now? Yes, now, while the spirit is with us.\\
355 - Can I pee first?\\
356 - There'll be plenty of time to pee in Heaven.\\
357 - There's peeing in Heaven?\\
358 - Shh!\\
359 - Weird, us both being on our knees at the same time, huh?\\
360 - Shh!\\
361 - I'm just saying.\\
362 - * Men. *\\
363 - Morning.\\
364 - Morning. Morning.\\
365 - Morning. How'd everybody sleep?\\
366 - Fine. Fine.\\
367 - Lousy.\\
368 - So, listen...\\
369 - we might have a little problem with Miss Pasternak.\\
370 - Oh, Charlie, you didn't.\\
371 - No, I didn't. Why do you always believe the worst of me?\\
372 - Because you're a horrible, evil person.\\
373 - I thought we established that.\\
374 - I'll tell you what happened.\\
375 - Last night, I was upstairs, sleeping alone,\\
376 - minding my own business...\\
377 - Good morning, sinners.\\
378 - Oh, what a glorious day\\
379 - to bask in the forgiveness of our Lord.\\
380 - Uh-oh.\\
381 - Jake, I have wonderful news.\\
382 - From now on, as part of each lesson,\\
383 - we're gonna spend time casting demons out of you.\\
384 - It's the Devil that's making him stupid.\\
385 - I told you it wasn't my fault.\\
386 - Uh, uh, Miss Pasternak, while I'm thrilled\\
387 - that you're helping Jake with his schoolwork,\\
388 - I'm not sure an exorcism is really called for.\\
389 - Do you want your son to go to hell, Alan?\\
390 - Depends.\\
391 - Do they have a college prep program?\\
392 - Eternal damnation is no laughing matter.\\
393 - I know-- I've been married twice.\\
394 - (laughs)\\
395 - You think you have to wear a jockstrap in hell?\\
396 - Yes, but not your own.\\
397 - Anyway,\\
398 - I just came down to tell you all\\
399 - it's time to get dressed for church.\\
400 - Uh, uh, gee,\\
401 - uh, thanks for the invite,\\
402 - but, uh, Sunday is kind of our "me" day.\\
403 - Sunday's not a "me" day, it's a "he" day.\\
404 - And he will strike down the blasphemers and the disbelievers\\
405 - with fury and blood-soaked vengeance!\\
406 - So, chop-chop, washy-washy.\\
407 - I've said it before, and I'll say it again:\\
408 - Boy, can I pick 'em.\\
409 - * Men. *\\
410 - CONGREGATION: * Bringing in the sheaves\\
411 - * Bringing in the sheaves *\\
412 - * We shall come rejoicing\\
413 - * Bringing in the sheaves\\
414 - * Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in... *\\
415 - Dad? What?\\
416 - I promise I'll work really hard in school\\
417 - if you can just get rid of her.\\
418 - A little religion isn't gonna kill you.\\
419 - Oh, really?\\
420 - What's your definition of "blood-soaked vengeance"?\\
421 - * Bringing in the sheaves\\
422 - * Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves *\\
423 - * We shall come rejoicing\\
424 - Why you looking at me like that?\\
425 - I just don't want to miss it when you burst into flames.\\
426 - * Bringing in the sheaves\\
427 - * We shall come rejoicing...\\
428 - Isn't this a beautiful little church, Charlie?\\
429 - Oh, yeah, it's great.\\
430 - Listen, I thought maybe after the service,\\
431 - you and I could drive around\\
432 - and look for a nice apartment for you.\\
433 - Oh, God doesn't want us to separate, Charlie.\\
434 - He brought you back into my life\\
435 - so that we could be together for all eternity.\\
436 - Um, are those his words or yours?\\
437 - He speaks through me.\\
438 - Oh, okay.\\
439 - Um, to whom am I talking now?\\
440 - (music ends)\\
441 - Oh, oh.\\
442 - It's time for the special blessing.\\
443 - Come on, everyone, let's go.\\
444 - Right behind you.\\
445 - (organ playing)\\
446 - Come on, come on, come on.\\
447 - Blessing time, blessing time.\\
448 - Come on.\\
449 - Is this the kind of church\\
450 - where they hand out those little crackers?\\
451 - Shh! I'm hungry.\\
452 - Relax.\\
453 - It's just us.\\
454 - Oh.\\
455 - Why is your hair all wet?\\
456 - They tried to drown me.\\
457 - No, they didn't.\\
458 - He managed to get himself baptized.\\
459 - How'd that happen?\\
460 - People were lining up.\\
461 - I thought there was food.\\
462 - Even after they took your clothes\\
463 - and gave you a white robe?\\
464 - I figured maybe we were getting ribs.\\
465 - So where's Berta?\\
466 - She took a shine to the organ player\\
467 - and stayed for the senior potluck brunch.\\
468 - So there was food.\\
469 - I knew I wasn't crazy.\\
470 - Aren't you at all concerned about\\
471 - what happened to Miss Pasternak?\\
472 - Of course I'm concerned.\\
473 - I tried to hide, didn't I?\\
474 - After she realized\\
475 - that you had dumped her yet again,\\
476 - she had a little bit of a meltdown.\\
477 - There was more to melt?\\
478 - She was dripping through the cone when she left the house.\\
479 - She grabbed all the bills out of the collection plate\\
480 - and started grinding on the minister.\\
481 - Okay. No harm, no foul.\\
482 - How do you figure?\\
483 - That's how we found her, right?\\
484 - Dry-humping for dollars.\\
485 - What happened to all your guilt about ruining her life?\\
486 - Oh, I still got it.\\
487 - I'm just learning to live with it.\\
488 - You're unbelievable.\\
489 - Oh, come on.\\
490 - I tried to do the right thing.\\
491 - My intentions were good.\\
492 - That's the funny thing about you.\\
493 - Doesn't seem to matter what your intentions are.\\
494 - Good, bad or indifferent,\\
495 - everyone around you ends up suffering.\\
496 - So it's not my fault, right?\\
497 - Right.\\
498 - Come on, I'll buy you a drink.\\
499 - I'm really not in the mood.\\
500 - Oh, relax.\\
501 - It's all over.\\
502 - Nothing to worry about.
\subsection {Episode 06: It's Always Nazi Week}
1 - (doorbell chiming)\\
2 - Oh, hey, Alan.\\
3 - Jake, your dad's here.\\
4 - So, how's it going?\\
5 - All good.\\
6 - Good.\\
7 - You? Good.\\
8 - Well, good.\\
9 - Yeah, good.\\
10 - Gooood.\\
11 - Well, I, uh, I see you put in a new mailbox.\\
12 - Oh, yeah, the old one was pretty shoddy.\\
13 - Whoever put it in didn't anchor the pole correctly.\\
14 - That would be me.\\
15 - Oh, sorry.\\
16 - The mailman was complaining about the wiggle.\\
17 - Herb, the mailman's a pothead.\\
18 - Yeah, I know. I caught him eating my tomato plants.\\
19 - Anyway, I just decided to replace the whole thing.\\
20 - Yeah, I see it, uh, it now says "The Melnicks."\\
21 - Well, I paid for the mailbox.\\
22 - I get my mail there.\\
23 - My name's Melnick...\\
24 - Yeah, I... I get it.\\
25 - Charlie Harper.\\
26 - Oh.\\
27 - Jake!\\
28 - No need to yell. He's in the bathroom.\\
29 - Big surprise, eh?\\
30 - He's either shoveling it in or shooting it out.\\
31 - Yeah, he's a regular Play-Doh fun factory.\\
32 - Just go make sure he hasn't fallen asleep in there again.\\
33 - Yes, dear.\\
34 - So, how's everything?\\
35 - Fine.\\
36 - Listen, Alan, I've been thinking now that Jake's a teenager,\\
37 - he'd benefit from spending some more time with his dad.\\
38 - Oh, oh, that would be great.\\
39 - Nothing would make me happier\\
40 - than to spending more time with my son.\\
41 - Good.\\
42 - Hey, Dad.\\
43 - Oh, hey, buddy.\\
44 - All finished in the bathroom?\\
45 - For now.\\
46 - You should've seen the last one.\\
47 - It looked like a question mark.\\
48 - Terrific.\\
49 - And it came out of my colon.\\
50 - Get it?\\
51 - Hilarious.\\
52 - Commas are easy.\\
53 - Go.\\
54 - Um, so, uh, what are we talking about here?\\
55 - You know, an extra day or two every other week?\\
56 - Actually, I was thinking more like a solid three months.\\
57 - In a row?\\
58 - Alan, how many sons do you have?\\
59 - As many as you do.\\
60 - Look, do you want your kid or not?\\
61 - Of course, but... well, I'll have to clear it with Charlie,\\
62 - and... and there is the financial issue.\\
63 - What financial issue?\\
64 - Well, if he's going to be living with me,\\
65 - I'm thinking I should get a sizeable break\\
66 - on the child support.\\
67 - Well, you're certainly entitled to your opinion.\\
68 - Well, thank you.\\
69 - Wait a minute.\\
70 - Three months in a row?!\\
71 - Come on. It'll be fun. For who?\\
72 - All he does is eat, sleep and clog up the toilets.\\
73 - Shh!\\
74 - Let's talk about this later.\\
75 - Oh, please, chowderhead can't hear us.\\
76 - Right, chowderhead?\\
77 - See?\\
78 - Oh, just admit it: you love having him around.\\
79 - I love having him around because I always know he's leaving.\\
80 - Don't take the leaving part away from me, Alan.\\
81 - Let's just give it a chance.\\
82 - See how it works.\\
83 - That's what Poland said about the Germans.\\
84 - Been watching the History Channel again?\\
85 - It's Nazi week.\\
86 - It's always Nazi week.\\
87 - Look, tell you what,\\
88 - why don't I take you and Jake out to dinner tonight?\\
89 - Can we get chili burgers?\\
90 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
91 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
92 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
93 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
94 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
95 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
96 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
97 - * Men.\\
98 - Well, this is fun, huh?\\
99 - The three Harper boys sitting around the campfire,\\
100 - putting on the feedbag.\\
101 - Yeah, bite me.\\
102 - So, numbnuts...\\
103 - Any thoughts as to why your mom dumped you off on us?\\
104 - Charlie.\\
105 - Oh, like you're not curious.\\
106 - No! No, I'm not curious.\\
107 - She just thought it would be a good idea\\
108 - for him to spend more time with his father.\\
109 - Yeah, and I'm trying to save girls\\
110 - a long ride home on the freeway.\\
111 - So what's your theory, Alfalfa?\\
112 - I think you're just pretending to be considerate\\
113 - so you can have sex with them.\\
114 - No, no, I mean about your mother and Herb.\\
115 - Oh.\\
116 - They are fighting a lot.\\
117 - They're fighting?\\
118 - Yep.\\
119 - 31.\\
120 - 31?\\
121 - It's what you get when you add 24 and seven.\\
122 - You know, they're fighting all the time.\\
123 - 24/7.\\
124 - 31.\\
125 - I'm not gonna make it three months, Alan.\\
126 - You're gonna be fine.\\
127 - They're fighting in front of you?\\
128 - They don't think they're fighting in front of me\\
129 - 'cause sometimes when I wear the headphones,\\
130 - I turn the music off.\\
131 - And you figured that out all by yourself?\\
132 - Hey, you may think I'm dumb, but you overestimate me.\\
133 - My mistake.\\
134 - So what are they arguing about?\\
135 - Well, she doesn't like his parents,\\
136 - he doesn't like her spending, and something about sex.\\
137 - What about sex?\\
138 - That's when I turn the music back on, you sick freak.\\
139 - Sorry.\\
140 - I mean, that's my mother.\\
141 - I said I'm sorry.\\
142 - Man, I'm not gonna make it three months.\\
143 - Oh, great, now he's got the moral high ground.\\
144 - Forget about that.\\
145 - The important thing is,\\
146 - Judith and Herb are having marital problems.\\
147 - Why does that make you happy?\\
148 - Well, it's not happiness exactly.\\
149 - It's just that, you know,\\
150 - all these years she's been blaming me\\
151 - for the failure of our marriage, and now...\\
152 - Yeah, I guess happiness pretty much sums it up.\\
153 - * Men.\\
154 - Hey, what's this I hear\\
155 - about Little Lord Skidmark coming to live here full time?\\
156 - Oh, it's just for a few weeks.\\
157 - I'm sure if we all pull together,\\
158 - you'll hardly even notice he's here.\\
159 - Yeah, pull this.\\
160 - Charlie!\\
161 - You and me gotta have a conversation.\\
162 - Nice talking to you.\\
163 - (doorbell rings)\\
164 - Hey, Alan. Oh, hey, Herb.\\
165 - Judith asked me to drop this stuff off for Jake.\\
166 - Oh, let me help you.\\
167 - Thanks.\\
168 - So, what have you two lovebirds got planned\\
169 - for the next few months?\\
170 - Second honeymoon?\\
171 - No, not exactly.\\
172 - Hard to believe you're coming up on your second anniversary.\\
173 - Yep. Hard to believe.\\
174 - Two years.\\
175 - Time flies when you're having fun, eh?\\
176 - I wouldn't know.\\
177 - Hey, Herb.\\
178 - Hey, Charlie.\\
179 - You ask him about his marriage going down the crapper?\\
180 - I was easing into it.\\
181 - So was I.\\
182 - What's the problem, Herb?\\
183 - Is it in the bedroom?\\
184 - It usually starts in the bedroom.\\
185 - That's still my mother, you sick freak!\\
186 - We usually wait till he puts on headphones\\
187 - before we discuss these things.\\
188 - Gee, Herb, something you should know\\
189 - about the headphones is...\\
190 - Shh, shh! Don't spoil it.\\
191 - So what's the deal? Is it sex?\\
192 - No.\\
193 - Well, yeah, but... it's no big deal.\\
194 - I mean every marriage has an ebb and flow to it.\\
195 - Of course. Sure. Sure.\\
196 - Right now Judith and I are kind of ebbing.\\
197 - A lot.\\
198 - 31.\\
199 - Right.\\
200 - 31.\\
201 - I don't know what's happening, man.\\
202 - We can't seem to communicate anymore.\\
203 - She constantly finds fault with me.\\
204 - I don't know what to do.\\
205 - I'll tell you what to do.\\
206 - What my testicle-challenged brother should have done.\\
207 - As soon as she starts complaining,\\
208 - you put your foot down.\\
209 - Let her know who's in charge.\\
210 - And no matter what, do not let her use sex as a weapon.\\
211 - You let her know that if she won't satisfy your needs,\\
212 - there's plenty of women out there who will.\\
213 - Really?\\
214 - Why would I lie?\\
215 - Women like Judith respond to strength and confidence, not...\\
216 - well, that.\\
217 - Oh, you make a compelling case.\\
218 - Damn right I do.\\
219 - Now go claim what's yours.\\
220 - I believe I will.\\
221 - Thanks, Charlie.\\
222 - I'm here for you, big guy.\\
223 - Why did you do that?\\
224 - I get bored.\\
225 - * Men.\\
226 - Hey. Hey.\\
227 - Why aren't you in school?\\
228 - I'm sick.\\
229 - Sick?\\
230 - Relax, I'm just faking to get out of a math test.\\
231 - Oh, okay, good.\\
232 - You scared me.\\
233 - What's with the staple gun?\\
234 - Oh, the sole's coming off my shoe.\\
235 - Ah.\\
236 - You might want to take it off first.\\
237 - Good call.\\
238 - Morning.\\
239 - (staple gun clacking)\\
240 - It's none of my business, but that's one kid\\
241 - who can't afford to miss a single day of school.\\
242 - (staple gun clacking)\\
243 - Yeah, like school's gonna make a difference.\\
244 - (staple gun clacking) JAKE: Ow! Crap!\\
245 - I stapled my fingers together.\\
246 - You got a point.\\
247 - * Men.\\
248 - Come on, honey. Blow.\\
249 - (blowing nose)\\
250 - (muffled): What's he got?\\
251 - A cold, I think.\\
252 - Then why didn't you leave him at home?\\
253 - That way, we all don't have to get sick.\\
254 - (coughing)\\
255 - And that's why you should always take your shoes\\
256 - to a fully qualified, professional cobbler.\\
257 - You know what's good? Apple cobbler.\\
258 - What's the damage, doc?\\
259 - Will he play the violin again?\\
260 - He'll be fine.\\
261 - You might wanna keep him away from staple guns.\\
262 - Right.\\
263 - Also nail guns, glue guns,\\
264 - pretty much anything with "gun" in it.\\
265 - Got it. Thanks, Herb.\\
266 - Hey, Charlie, could I talk for you a sec?\\
267 - Why don't you go wait for me in the car?\\
268 - Gimme the keys.\\
269 - I'm not giving you the keys.\\
270 - Then how am I gonna wait in the car?\\
271 - Wait by the car.\\
272 - I don't have sunscreen on. I'm very fair-skinned.\\
273 - Then wait under the car.\\
274 - What's up?\\
275 - Well, remember that advice you gave me\\
276 - about how to handle Judith?\\
277 - Oh, gee, Herb, that wasn't so much advice\\
278 - as, you know, social satire.\\
279 - Well, it worked out great.\\
280 - Really?\\
281 - She bought that king-of-the-castle crap?\\
282 - No, no, she kicked my ass out.\\
283 - But the thing is, talking with you\\
284 - and seeing how you live,\\
285 - I'm convinced I'm better off single.\\
286 - Is that so?\\
287 - Oh, yeah. I mean, why chew on one chicken wing\\
288 - when you can eat from the whole bucket?\\
289 - Just so there's no confusion.\\
290 - Chicken wings are...?\\
291 - Women, Charlie.\\
292 - I was offering up a metaphor.\\
293 - And you went with wings rather than breasts and thighs.\\
294 - Ooh, that is better.\\
295 - Anyway, I was thinking maybe you and I can go out sometime\\
296 - and get a party pack.\\
297 - Sex with strange women.\\
298 - I'm extending the metaphor.\\
299 - Of course. Sure, let's do that sometime.\\
300 - Thanks again for sewing up the kid.\\
301 - So, uh, what color do you like?\\
302 - Excuse me?\\
303 - Oh, I-I was thinking Asian, but I'll take the green.\\
304 - * Men.\\
305 - Hey, Dad.\\
306 - Oh, hey. How are you feeling?\\
307 - Fine.\\
308 - Throat's not sore anymore?\\
309 - (coughs) Oh, yeah, a little.\\
310 - What happened to your fingers?\\
311 - Oh, I stapled 'em together.\\
312 - Ah.\\
313 - Hey, hey, we do not leave our shoes on the...\\
314 - What the hell?\\
315 - We need to get rid of the staple gun.\\
316 - Alan, staple guns don't staple shoes to coffee tables.\\
317 - Idiots do.\\
318 - Why are you taking your temperature?\\
319 - I think some little snot locker gave me smallpox.\\
320 - (phone rings)\\
321 - Oh, man, leave me alone.\\
322 - Is that Mom?\\
323 - You think maybe I might want to talk to her?\\
324 - Do you?\\
325 - Of course not. It's the principle.\\
326 - Well, that wasn't Mom. It was Herb.\\
327 - Why is Herb calling?\\
328 - Since Judith threw him out,\\
329 - he wants me to help him pick up women.\\
330 - Wait. Backupbackupbackupbackup backupbackup!\\
331 - Wait. Judith threw Herb out? When?\\
332 - I don't know. Apparently, about a week ago.\\
333 - Oh, my God.\\
334 - That's terrible.\\
335 - Judith must be devastated.\\
336 - Alan.\\
337 - Yeah?\\
338 - You got a little evil on your face.\\
339 - Other side.\\
340 - * Men.\\
341 - Oh, Judith, that's terrible.\\
342 - You must be devastated.\\
343 - You must be devastated.\\
344 - What are you doing here?\\
345 - Oh, I'm sorry to bother you.\\
346 - Apparently, Jake left his Social Studies book,\\
347 - so here I am.\\
348 - I think I saw it in the bathroom.\\
349 - Why? Was he out of toilet paper?\\
350 - Wouldn't it be great if he could learn that way?\\
351 - You know, assmosis.\\
352 - What?\\
353 - Nothing.\\
354 - Is Herb around?\\
355 - Uh, no.\\
356 - Oh. Oh, too bad.\\
357 - Why?\\
358 - No reason.\\
359 - I just enjoy seeing the big galoot.\\
360 - Well, the galoot is not here.\\
361 - Oh. Well, uh...\\
362 - tell him I said hi.\\
363 - I will.\\
364 - (sobbing)\\
365 - Herb moved out!\\
366 - Our marriage is over!\\
367 - Oh, Judith, that's terrible.\\
368 - You must be devastated.\\
369 - * Men.\\
370 - What exactly do you have in mind?\\
371 - Give me your hand.\\
372 - Okay.\\
373 - Do I feel warm to you?\\
374 - Dude!\\
375 - Aw, crap.\\
376 - So, uh, you fishing here or can I throw my bobber in the water?\\
377 - Bye.\\
378 - How'd you know I was here?\\
379 - Well, I tried calling,\\
380 - but your phone must be broken,\\
381 - so I went by your house and Jake said you went out.\\
382 - All I had to do was punch "liquor"\\
383 - into the ol' in-dash navigation system,\\
384 - and three stops later, voila.\\
385 - So, uh, they biting tonight?\\
386 - Okay, first of all,\\
387 - can we stop with the fish talk?\\
388 - Believe me, it's not gonna lead anyplace good.\\
389 - Back to the chickens?\\
390 - If we must.\\
391 - I'll have what he's having.\\
392 - I'm having a tall Pain in the Ass.\\
393 - Sounds good.\\
394 - Does it have rum in it?\\
395 - How did this happen?\\
396 - How did I blow another marriage?\\
397 - Oh, sweetie, you can't blame yourself.\\
398 - Although you are the common denominator.\\
399 - Alan, I'm 40 years old.\\
400 - How am I ever gonna start over again?\\
401 - I know, I know.\\
402 - And soon you're gonna be 41.\\
403 - Do you have any idea what it's like\\
404 - to try and date when all the men your age\\
405 - are only interested in 25-year-old hard bodies?\\
406 - Well, you can't blame us.\\
407 - Of course, you can't compete hard body to hard body,\\
408 - but you're still a very desirable woman.\\
409 - You think so?\\
410 - Well, of course I do.\\
411 - For your age, you're a very...\\
412 - Hey, Charlie, I've got a question for you.\\
413 - Yeah.\\
414 - The hotel I'm staying in has pay-per-view adult movies.\\
415 - Uh-huh?\\
416 - Whatever happened to pubic hair?\\
417 - Gone the way of the dodo bird, my friend.\\
418 - I mean, I can understand with the ladies,\\
419 - but what's the deal with the fellas?\\
420 - It's like with an ugly house.\\
421 - A little shrubbery helps the curb appeal.\\
422 - I don't have an answer for you, Herb.\\
423 - What about you?\\
424 - Do you trim the old hedges?\\
425 - Yeah. They're shaped like Disney characters.\\
426 - Two more vodka tonics.\\
427 - Cock-a-doodle-do.\\
428 - Hello.\\
429 - Hello.\\
430 - Allow me to introduce myself.\\
431 - Dr. Herbert Melnick.\\
432 - Ooh, a doctor.\\
433 - Dr. Charlie Harper.\\
434 - Wow, two doctors.\\
435 - Maybe we should let them examine us.\\
436 - (both giggle)\\
437 - In the interest of full disclosure,\\
438 - I should let you know that I'm new to the dating world\\
439 - and still have all my original pubic hair.\\
440 - Oh, Alan, why did I ever let you go?\\
441 - Well, if I recall,\\
442 - it was something about me sucking the life out of you.\\
443 - I was wrong. I was so wrong.\\
444 - You are a good man and I'm never gonna let you go again.\\
445 - Never?\\
446 - Never.\\
447 - Never ever?\\
448 - * Men.\\
449 - * Men.\\
450 - Morning.\\
451 - Morning.\\
452 - What was Herb doing here?\\
453 - Oh, he, uh...\\
454 - (rock music blaring)\\
455 - (music stops playing)\\
456 - He shaved his pubes and passed out in your room.\\
457 - You might want to change the blade in your razor.\\
458 - Thank you.\\
459 - Where were you all night?\\
460 - I was in Never Ever Land.\\
461 - Um...\\
462 - do I want to know?\\
463 - I took away the staple gun, but he found the superglue.\\
464 - * Men.

1 - Previously on:\\
2 - Wait. Judith threw Herb out? When?\\
3 - Apparently, about a week ago.\\
4 - Of course you can't compete hard body to hard body,\\
5 - but you're still a very desirable woman.\\
6 - You think so?\\
7 - Oh! Oh, Alan.\\
8 - You're a good man, and I'm never gonna let you go again.\\
9 - (laughs)\\
10 - Never?\\
11 - I thought you'd be happy.\\
12 - I thought so, too.\\
13 - I mean, come on.\\
14 - You had the woman who took all your money\\
15 - and threw you out of your house, naked and crouched on the sofa.\\
16 - There was no sofa.\\
17 - It was the divan in her bedroom, and I was doing the crouching.\\
18 - Why were you...?\\
19 - Never mind. I don't want to know.\\
20 - The point is, you won.\\
21 - You had a perfect night of revenge sex.\\
22 - That's the fourth best kind of sex you can have.\\
23 - Fourth?\\
24 - What are the other...?\\
25 - Never mind. I don't want to know.\\
26 - Charlie, the problem is that now that Judith and Herb are over,\\
27 - she thinks that we're...\\
28 - ...back to square one\\
29 - in dealing with the PTA carnival.\\
30 - What?\\
31 - The-The school carnival\\
32 - that we used to, uh, raise money for.\\
33 - (quietly): I don't want Jake to know about me and Judith...\\
34 - ...Ithcariot.\\
35 - Judith Ithcariot.\\
36 - Who thold out our lord for 30 pieces of thilver.\\
37 - What are you talking about?\\
38 - Oh, I was just, uh, telling your uncle\\
39 - about this, uh... this, uh... this great, uh, cartoon.\\
40 - Uh, "Daffy Duck and the Greateth Sthory Ever Told."\\
41 - Sounds lame.\\
42 - Classic Warner Brothers animation.\\
43 - (laughs)\\
44 - Boy, you really suck at this.\\
45 - The thing is, I'm not sure I want to be back with Judith.\\
46 - Well, let's look at the pros and cons.\\
47 - The pros are, if you move out,\\
48 - I'll have an empty guest room....\\
49 - tinest, tootin'est apostle in all of Jerusalem.\\
50 - Gethsemane Sam!\\
51 - What?\\
52 - Or how about Barabas Bunny?\\
53 - (like Bugs Bunny): Uh, what's up, Pontius?\\
54 - If Berta finds out you're leaving,\\
55 - she'll want your room, and I don't need a live-in maid.\\
56 - Oh, don't worry. I'm not leaving.\\
57 - Oh, good, 'cause I was worried.\\
58 - Look,\\
59 - I have already been married to Judith, and we...\\
60 - We... We...\\
61 - We should send Jack to military school?\\
62 - What?\\
63 - Oh, oh, uh, yeah.\\
64 - Charlie, he wasn't supposed to hear that.\\
65 - I'm going to military school?\\
66 - If you don't shape up, yeah.\\
67 - And it's not gonna be our military, either.\\
68 - I don't want to go to any military school.\\
69 - Well, then, you better get to your homework.\\
70 - Okay, okay.\\
71 - Extortion.\\
72 - So simple.\\
73 - Who knew? Yeah.\\
74 - If the kid's going to military school,\\
75 - I'll take his room.\\
76 - No, no, Berta, you misunderstood.\\
77 - He's not going to military school?\\
78 - JAKE: I'm not going to military school?!\\
79 - You are going to military school!\\
80 - He's not going to military school.\\
81 - Okay, then, I'll take Zippy's room\\
82 - when he moves back to Judith.\\
83 - (whispers): Oh, for God's sake, does she hear everything?\\
84 - BERTA: Some things I just infer.\\
85 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
86 - * Oh-ho * Men. *\\
87 - Get me another beer, would you?\\
88 - Why can't you get it yourself?\\
89 - (humming "Reveille")\\
90 - This is beautiful.\\
91 - (phone ringing)\\
92 - Hey, Judith. What's shakin'?\\
93 - Mom, I'll be good! Don't send me to military school!\\
94 - Where's that beer, maggot?\\
95 - Nothing. Nothing.\\
96 - Just a little game we're playing.\\
97 - So anyway, Judy, what's new in your little world?\\
98 - Hang on. I'll see if he's here.\\
99 - (whispers): Oh, no, no. I'm not here. I'm not here.\\
100 - Sorry, he's not here.\\
101 - Oh, wait. He just walked in.\\
102 - (whispers): Why?\\
103 - (whispers): Why not?\\
104 - Oh, hey, hey, Judith.\\
105 - I was just about to call you.\\
106 - Yeah. Uh, yeah.\\
107 - Hold on a sec.\\
108 - Let me... Let me get some privacy.\\
109 - What are they talking about?\\
110 - Nothing important.\\
111 - I'm gonna miss you, buddy.\\
112 - (playing gentle melody)\\
113 - Where's Jake?\\
114 - Washing my car.\\
115 - Then he's gonna clean the garage.\\
116 - We should have thought of this years ago.\\
117 - I know. I'm kicking myself.\\
118 - Okay, I won't be late.\\
119 - Hot date with the ex?\\
120 - Oh, no, nothing hot about it.\\
121 - It's just dinner, and I'm going to tell her\\
122 - that the other night was just a onetime thing,\\
123 - and that I don't see that we have a future together.\\
124 - But me you see a future with?\\
125 - I finished the garage.\\
126 - You sure?\\
127 - Yeah.\\
128 - (plays "The Halls of Montezuma")\\
129 - Let me look again.\\
130 - (ends song with a flourish)\\
131 - More wine?\\
132 - Oh, I'd-I'd better not.\\
133 - I have to drive.\\
134 - Have some more wine. Oh.\\
135 - Maybe a splash.\\
136 - Oh, oh, my.\\
137 - (laughs)\\
138 - I, uh, hope this is a good driving wine.\\
139 - (laughs)\\
140 - Oh, that-that feels good.\\
141 - I'm glad.\\
142 - Have you been working out?\\
143 - Oh, just the Bowflex.\\
144 - I, uh, had to give up my gym membership\\
145 - so I could get my tooth filled.\\
146 - Well, whatever you're doing, it's working.\\
147 - A lot of definition here.\\
148 - Oh, Oh, that would be this one.\\
149 - Oh, yeah, there it is.\\
150 - Yeah, yeah.\\
151 - (laughs)\\
152 - So, would you like some dessert?\\
153 - Oh, oh, don't go to any trouble.\\
154 - It's no trouble, sweetie.\\
155 - I like taking care of you.\\
156 - And I like being taken care of.\\
157 - Ugh!\\
158 - Wake up! Wake up!\\
159 - Um, uh, listen, Judith,\\
160 - I-I've been thinking about you and me.\\
161 - Me, too.\\
162 - Oh. Oh. Oh, good.\\
163 - You know, even though\\
164 - the other night was wonderful and all,\\
165 - I think it might be better\\
166 - if we tried slowing things down a bit.\\
167 - I agree. You do?\\
168 - Of course. I'm barely out of my marriage to Herb.\\
169 - True, true.\\
170 - Here, careful. Hot pudding.\\
171 - So, uh, you'll get the divorce,\\
172 - and then, you know, we'll see where we are.\\
173 - That sounds great. Well, good.\\
174 - I'm, uh... I'm glad we're on the same page.\\
175 - (grunts)\\
176 - Oh, hot. I told you it was hot.\\
177 - Hot! Hot! Hot!\\
178 - Have some more wine.\\
179 - Aw. Oh.\\
180 - That's better. That's better.\\
181 - I'll get your spoon.\\
182 - Oh. Oh, God.\\
183 - Oh.... pudding!\\
184 - MAN (on TV): So when the moment's right, and she's ready,\\
185 - you'll be ready, too.\\
186 - Side effects may include, nausea, headaches, dry mouth,\\
187 - blurred vision, dizziness, anal leakage,\\
188 - kidney failure and massive stroke.\\
189 - She'd better be ready to call an ambulance.\\
190 - Hey.\\
191 - Hey.\\
192 - Is Jake asleep?\\
193 - Probably not.\\
194 - After dinner, I made him watch Full Metal Jacket\\
195 - and Deerhunter.\\
196 - Oh, Charlie.\\
197 - And how was your evening?\\
198 - Oh, it was really a lot of fun.\\
199 - You know, I'd forgotten how nice she can be.\\
200 - Judith?\\
201 - Who else would I be talking about?\\
202 - I don't know. Somebody actually nice.\\
203 - What was the name of Jimmy Carter's wife?\\
204 - Rosalynn?\\
205 - She was nice.\\
206 - I always got a good vibe off her.\\
207 - Are you drunk?\\
208 - Define drunk.\\
209 - Would you rather I talk to you in the morning?\\
210 - No, no. The liquor makes you more interesting. Go on.\\
211 - Judith's changed, Charlie.\\
212 - She's-She's a different woman.\\
213 - Different than the one who threw you out of your house\\
214 - with your nuts in a to-go bag?\\
215 - That's a little graphic, don't you think?\\
216 - I'm an artist, Alan.\\
217 - I paint with words.\\
218 - You're a lush, Charlie.\\
219 - You paint with vomit.\\
220 - My point is that Judith has become a warm, nurturing woman.\\
221 - You nailed her again, didn't you?\\
222 - No, no, no, it was just, just the one time.\\
223 - Tonight, we did not have sex.\\
224 - Technically.\\
225 - Really? Judith?\\
226 - I know. I had to keep peeking to make sure it was her.\\
227 - Well, congratulations.\\
228 - So when are you gonna move back in?\\
229 - Ah, we're not quite there yet.\\
230 - Oh, come on, why wait?\\
231 - We could load up the car and drive over there tonight.\\
232 - You promised if I shaped up, I wouldn't have to go!\\
233 - Aren't you starting to feel a little guilty\\
234 - about misleading him?\\
235 - Yeah, I guess.\\
236 - Tell you what.\\
237 - After he finishes cleaning the deck tomorrow,\\
238 - let's really send him to military school.\\
239 - * Men.\\
240 - How's it going?\\
241 - I'm almost done.\\
242 - What about the railing?\\
243 - It's getting dark. I won't finish in time.\\
244 - No problem. I'll give you a hand.\\
245 - Gee, thanks.\\
246 - You back-talkin' me, soldier?\\
247 - No.\\
248 - No what?\\
249 - No way?\\
250 - No, sir.\\
251 - Right. No, sir.\\
252 - That's better.\\
253 - * I don't know, what I've been told *\\
254 - * Screwin' with jughead never gets old. *\\
255 - Okay, don't wait up.\\
256 - Hey, Alan,\\
257 - the chimney's a little blocked up\\
258 - with leaves and crap, and I thought,\\
259 - maybe if I tied a rope around the kid,\\
260 - I could lower him down into it...\\
261 - Charlie, that borders on child abuse.\\
262 - So, it's okay?\\
263 - Around his waist, not his neck.\\
264 - Good night, Jake.\\
265 - Good night, Dad. I love you.\\
266 - Oh, Herb, hi.\\
267 - Hey, Alan, Charlie.\\
268 - Hey, Herb. What's up?\\
269 - Well, I was just on my way down to The Sand Dollar.\\
270 - I thought maybe you and Alan would like to join me.\\
271 - It's ladies night.\\
272 - What do you say, Alan?\\
273 - You can get in for half price.\\
274 - Plus, all-you-can-eat popcorn shrimp.\\
275 - CHARLIE: Wow.\\
276 - Just keeps getting better, huh?\\
277 - No, I-I-I... I have other plans.\\
278 - Oh. Got a date?\\
279 - Yeah, Alan.\\
280 - You got a date?\\
281 - No. A date?\\
282 - Not likely.\\
283 - No, I have a-a-a... a meeting with the, uh,\\
284 - the-the-the thing about the... about the group.\\
285 - I told you. Remember?\\
286 - No. Tell me again.\\
287 - He's a little pickled.\\
288 - (chuckling)\\
289 - Uh, well, if you must know, uh, uh,\\
290 - I-I-I-I belong to a...\\
291 - a book club that I am going to.\\
292 - Oh, that's right.\\
293 - What book are you reading again?\\
294 - It's... it's a mystery,\\
295 - uh, called Why Are You Doing This To Me?\\
296 - Oh, yeah, it's by the same guy\\
297 - who wrote Because It Amuses Me.\\
298 - Boy, I wouldn't have had you two\\
299 - pegged as readers.\\
300 - Well, there you go.\\
301 - Good night.\\
302 - Hey, Alan? Yeah?\\
303 - You talk much to Judith these days?\\
304 - Nope, see you. Oh, well,\\
305 - if you speak to her, tell her I say hi.\\
306 - Okay. And that the\\
307 - time we spent together is very special to me,\\
308 - and if she needs anything, uh, just call me.\\
309 - I'm there.\\
310 - You know what's a good book?\\
311 - Under the Dining Room Table by Richard Gobbler.\\
312 - But... but it does not compare\\
313 - to Wait Till Your Liver Fails by Hope Udai.\\
314 - Well, what do you say, Charlie, huh?\\
315 - Me and you?\\
316 - Go down to the Sand Dollar, have a few drinks.\\
317 - Who knows, maybe we'll meet a couple of nice gals.\\
318 - Sure, why not?\\
319 - And if the pickings are slim, you could always wrangle up\\
320 - some of your prostitute friends.\\
321 - Oh, boy.\\
322 - Prostitutes and popcorn shrimp.\\
323 - All you can eat.\\
324 - Okay, Herb,\\
325 - let me explain to you something about hookers.\\
326 - Oh, man.\\
327 - Who's been feeding the seagulls blueberries?\\
328 - * Men.\\
329 - Here you go.\\
330 - Oh, cr  me br  l  e.\\
331 - Yummy.\\
332 - (chuckling)\\
333 - (blowing)\\
334 - (clanging)\\
335 - Oops, I dropped my spoon.\\
336 - Um, you know, I... I ran into Herb today.\\
337 - (bang) Ow!\\
338 - What?\\
339 - He came by the house.\\
340 - Why would he come by your house?\\
341 - I just think he's lonely.\\
342 - He misses you.\\
343 - Well, too bad.\\
344 - So, you don't miss him?\\
345 - (bang) Ow, ow, Alan!\\
346 - Are we gonna spend all night talking about Herb\\
347 - or do you want me to get my spoon?\\
348 - Well, if you're gonna bark at me,\\
349 - there's really no point in you getting your spoon.\\
350 - I'm not barking at you, I'm...\\
351 - You're right.\\
352 - I'm sorry.\\
353 - I'm right and you're sorry?\\
354 - Mm-hmm.\\
355 - Let's not waste the night arguing\\
356 - when we could spend it doing anything you want.\\
357 - Anything?\\
358 - (whispering): Anything.\\
359 - Wow.\\
360 - Can you say I'm right again?\\
361 - Geez, Herb, you live here?\\
362 - This is really depressing.\\
363 - You should see it during the day.\\
364 - You'd want to hang yourself.\\
365 - Well, ladies,\\
366 - welcome to Casa de Herb.\\
367 - That's Spanish for House of Herb.\\
368 - Just open the door. Hold on.\\
369 - I'll trade you the lounge lizard\\
370 - for the Jolly Green Jackass.\\
371 - I hope you gals like trains.\\
372 - Slow down, buddy.\\
373 - It's just the two of us.\\
374 - All aboard!\\
375 - I bet you thought this was gonna be weird.\\
376 - Pretty nice, huh?\\
377 - Best H.O. money can buy.\\
378 - You don't have to spell it, Herb.\\
379 - They know what they are.\\
380 - So, shall we get this party started?\\
381 - Okeydokey.\\
382 - Would you like a snack or a cold beverage?\\
383 - Um, Herb, while there is a social stigma\\
384 - to this transaction, the big plus is these girls\\
385 - don't require any wining and dining.\\
386 - They just want to do the deed,\\
387 - then get as far away from us as they can.\\
388 - Really?\\
389 - Not even a Snapple?\\
390 - They're not thirsty, Herb.\\
391 - And you're paying them by the hour.\\
392 - Oh, okay.\\
393 - Well, I guess we should just, uh,\\
394 - go to the bedroom and, uh...\\
395 - Don't make me do this, Charlie.\\
396 - What are you talking about?\\
397 - This was your idea.\\
398 - I don't care.\\
399 - I'm not like you.\\
400 - I can't lay with whores.\\
401 - No offense.\\
402 - Where are you going?\\
403 - I love my wife!\\
404 - I want her back!\\
405 - All aboard?\\
406 - * Men.\\
407 - (Alan humming)\\
408 - Sweetie, uh, you're humming again.\\
409 - Sorry.\\
410 - Don't know the words.\\
411 - Um, okay, uh, could you please\\
412 - not open your mouth so wide?\\
413 - Better now?\\
414 - Yeah, it's fine.\\
415 - Just, uh, can you not talk in my mouth?\\
416 - Wow.\\
417 - More rules than a public pool around here.\\
418 - They're not rules.\\
419 - It's just, uh, I know what I like,\\
420 - and you're not doing it.\\
421 - All right, fine, what, uh...\\
422 - what do you like, Judith?\\
423 - I have to tell you?\\
424 - No, no, let me guess and get yelled at.\\
425 - Nobody's yelling at you, Alan.\\
426 - I'm not your mother.\\
427 - Oh, you're right, my mother\\
428 - can emasculate me without raising her voice.\\
429 - Oh, God, I can't do this.\\
430 - Do what? I can't be with you again.\\
431 - I was afraid of being 40 years old\\
432 - and all by myself,\\
433 - but dying alone has got to be better\\
434 - than being stuck with you.\\
435 - Okay, now you're starting to sound like my mother.\\
436 - (knocking on door)\\
437 - HERB: Judith, I love you.\\
438 - Please take me back.\\
439 - Oh, boy, this is awkward.\\
440 - Coming, darling.\\
441 - Get out of here.\\
442 - Oh, uh, just so we're clear,\\
443 - we've decided to see other people?\\
444 - Get out!\\
445 - * Men.\\
446 - Thanks for the ride, girls.\\
447 - And for bringing me home.\\
448 - * I've been working on the railroad *\\
449 - * All the livelong day\\
450 - * Dinah won't you blow, Dinah won't you blow... *\\
451 - Hey, Alan.\\
452 - Hey.\\
453 - Mind if I join you?\\
454 - It's your house.\\
455 - Oh, yeah.\\
456 - Excuse me.\\
457 - Pardon me, hot soup.\\
458 - What the hell?\\
459 - Well, that's a little embarrassing.\\
460 - What is that?\\
461 - A railroad crossing sign.\\
462 - Sorry, I need more.\\
463 - I was having sex on a train set.\\
464 - How else do you get a crossing sign\\
465 - stuck to your ass?\\
466 - Of course.\\
467 - Hey, it could have been worse.\\
468 - I could have had a caboose in my caboose.\\
469 - (chuckling)\\
470 - Well, come on, that's funny.\\
471 - (forced, unenthusiastic laughter)\\
472 - So, what happened when Herb showed up at Judith's house?\\
473 - How did you know about that?\\
474 - Lucky guess.\\
475 - She kicked me out again, Charlie.\\
476 - I had to sneak out her back door\\
477 - while she threw herself into Herb's arms.\\
478 - (laughing)\\
479 - What's so funny?\\
480 - You said, "back door."\\
481 - That reminds me of my caboose joke.\\
482 - Good night.\\
483 - I'm here all week.\\
484 - Tip your waitresses.\\
485 - Hey, Mom, it's Charlie.\\
486 - Yeah, I know it's late.\\
487 - Listen, do you think this is funny?\\
488 - Huh.\\
489 - Must have got disconnected.\\
490 - Hey, Jake, you sleeping?\\
491 - * Men.\\
492 - * Men.\\
493 - (doorbell ringing)\\
494 - Doorbell. Doorbell!\\
495 - ALAN: Coming.\\
496 - Oh.\\
497 - Oh, hi, uh, thanks for bringing him over.\\
498 - Oh, no problem-- hey, guess what?\\
499 - Uh, Herb, why don't we let Jake tell him.\\
500 - Uh, tell me what?\\
501 - Jake?\\
502 - My grades aren't good enough\\
503 - for military school, so ha-ha.\\
504 - No, sweetheart, the other thing.\\
505 - Oh.\\
506 - I'm gonna have a little brother or sister.\\
507 - You're... you're pregnant?\\
508 - Yes, Alan.\\
509 - Herb and I are going to have a baby.\\
510 - Congratulations.\\
511 - Try to keep this one away from the lead paint.\\
512 - Did you hear that Alan?\\
513 - They've only been back together six weeks,\\
514 - and they're gonna have a baby.\\
515 - I heard.\\
516 - Come on in.\\
517 - We'll pop a bottle of champagne.\\
518 - (gasps) Champagne.\\
519 - Uh, no, we really should be going.\\
520 - Come on, Herb.\\
521 - Good-bye. Ah, shoot.\\
522 - What a remarkable coincidence.\\
523 - Yeah, coincidence.\\
524 - You okay? No.\\
525 - Come on, let's sit you down.\\
526 - Yeah... let's sit me down.\\
527 - Here you go, buddy.\\
528 - Here I go.\\
529 - What's wrong with him?\\
530 - He's doing math in his head.\\
531 - Oh, yeah, that's a bitch.

1 - * Men...\\
2 - * Mmm... mmm\\
3 - Morning.\\
4 - Mmm. Morning.\\
5 - Charlie, please don't start anything.\\
6 - Too late. I woke up started.\\
7 - I have to get to work.\\
8 - Okay, I've got a job for you.\\
9 - We'll finish this tonight.\\
10 - I may have to finish this myself.\\
11 - Knock yourself out.\\
12 - It's no fun if you have permission.\\
13 - So, Charlie, I was thinking maybe tonight\\
14 - we could stay at my place.\\
15 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\\
16 - Charlie?\\
17 - I'm sorry, did you say something?\\
18 - I said maybe tonight we could stay at my place.\\
19 - You want to play on my face?\\
20 - Stay at my place.\\
21 - Oh.\\
22 - What about it?\\
23 - I've been coming here for the past three weeks,\\
24 - and it's like an hour drive for me to get to work.\\
25 - Well, I'd be happy to spring for a cab.\\
26 - It's not the drive, you idiot.\\
27 - You just said it was the drive.\\
28 - What I mean is if we're gonna see each other\\
29 - on a regular basis, there should be some give and take.\\
30 - Based on last night, we're pretty even Steven\\
31 - in the give-and-take department.\\
32 - And if I recall correctly, you're up one "take."\\
33 - Hey, of the two of us, I'm the one with tennis elbow.\\
34 - So what about tonight?\\
35 - I'd love to, but it might be a little tricky.\\
36 - Why?\\
37 - (softly): Oh, I knew she'd ask me that.\\
38 - I'm starting to get the feeling\\
39 - that you only want to see at your place\\
40 - and at your convenience.\\
41 - No, of course not.\\
42 - Well, then fine, you'll stay at my place tonight.\\
43 - Sounds great.\\
44 - Lookin' forward to it.\\
45 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
46 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
47 - Doesn't matter, just as long as you and I are together.\\
48 - What did you do?\\
49 - I didn't do anything.\\
50 - Why would you even ask me that?\\
51 - I'm guessing he either robbed a liquor store\\
52 - or killed a drifter.\\
53 - Do I need to call your mother and ask her?\\
54 - If you want to, but you know how she pushes your buttons.\\
55 - I'll take that chance.\\
56 - Fine, I don't care.\\
57 - All right, all right! I got thrown off the school bus.\\
58 - You got the spine of a gummy bear.\\
59 - Why were you thrown off the bus?\\
60 - Well, actually, it's a funny story.\\
61 - Amuse me.\\
62 - Have you ever heard of this thing called mooning?\\
63 - Yeah. Yeah, it rings a bell.\\
64 - The bus was going past the girls' track team\\
65 - and a bunch of us thought it'd be funny to moon them.\\
66 - (chuckling)\\
67 - See, she gets it.\\
68 - Berta.\\
69 - Sorry. I'm just remembering my prom.\\
70 - (sighs) So what happened?\\
71 - Well, I was working near the high school that night,\\
72 - and I thought it would be fun to drive the backhoe...\\
73 - No. Not you.\\
74 - Him.\\
75 - Well. Excuse me for sharing.\\
76 - What happened?\\
77 - Well, it sounds like Berta had quite a prom.\\
78 - You're skating on thin ice, Jake.\\
79 - Boy, that's something we haven't done in a long time-- skating.\\
80 - Jake!\\
81 - Mom grounded me for two weeks.\\
82 - Why didn't your mother tell me about this?\\
83 - I promised I'd tell you.\\
84 - What can I say? She believed me.\\
85 - So how about a movie? A little father-son bonding.\\
86 - No, no. No movies.\\
87 - Skating? No skating.\\
88 - Fine.\\
89 - Also no TV, no video games,\\
90 - no cell phones, and no iPods--\\
91 - Couldn't you just smack me with a belt and get it over with?\\
92 - Get out of here.\\
93 - I'm bored.\\
94 - * Men...\\
95 - Oh, man.\\
96 - What's the matter?\\
97 - Did you know that Culver City\\
98 - is all the way down near the airport?\\
99 - Yes.\\
100 - That's gotta be like 45 minutes from here.\\
101 - If there's no traffic.\\
102 - Traffic?\\
103 - Is this Culver City place popular?\\
104 - Not particularly, but there are other people with cars\\
105 - living lives completely separate from your own.\\
106 - Oh, right.\\
107 - I hate those people.\\
108 - "So what's in Culver City?," he asked,\\
109 - knowing the only possible answer.\\
110 - Can you believe she wants me to schlep all the way\\
111 - over to her place just so we can spend the night together?\\
112 - Aw, you poor guy.\\
113 - You have to drive 45 minutes to get laid.\\
114 - And 45 minutes to get back.\\
115 - That's 90 minutes behind the wheel\\
116 - for 20, 30 minutes behind...\\
117 - Well, I don't need to draw you a map.\\
118 - You're breaking my heart.\\
119 - And it's not just that.\\
120 - She said there's only street parking.\\
121 - Which means trees.\\
122 - And trees have that, you know, toxic syrup\\
123 - that drips out of them and gets all over your car.\\
124 - Sap.\\
125 - If I make that drive, I am.\\
126 - Wait a minute, wait a minute.\\
127 - You always said that it was better to go\\
128 - to the woman's house so that you could make a quick getaway.\\
129 - Yeah, for one-nighters that's fine.\\
130 - But this girl, I care about.\\
131 - We've been seeing each other for almost a month.\\
132 - And yet you just found out where she lives.\\
133 - There's a difference between caring and stalking, Alan.\\
134 - Hey, Dad, I need my laptop.\\
135 - What for? Homework.\\
136 - What homework?\\
137 - Um... Damn, you're good.\\
138 - * Men...\\
139 - Thanks for driving all the way over here, Charlie.\\
140 - Are you kidding?\\
141 - I would've walked here if I had to.\\
142 - Probably would've been faster with the traffic.\\
143 - Good night.\\
144 - Good night.\\
145 - (car door slams)\\
146 - What are you doing?\\
147 - I heard a car door.\\
148 - Your Mercedes is fine, Charlie.\\
149 - I know, I know.\\
150 - Just double-checking.\\
151 - (alarm chirps)\\
152 - Probably gonna get sap all over the car cover.\\
153 - Isn't that what it's for?\\
154 - You don't get it. That's fine.\\
155 - No TV in the bedroom, huh?\\
156 - It's in the living room.\\
157 - You just got the one?\\
158 - How many do I need?\\
159 - Well, you've got three rooms and a bath, so... four.\\
160 - If you want to go watch television instead of cuddling,\\
161 - that's up to you.\\
162 - No, no, I'd much rather cuddle.\\
163 - At my house, we could do both.\\
164 - You know, cuddling and Sportscenter.\\
165 - Good night, Charlie.\\
166 - Sweet dreams.\\
167 - (sighs)\\
168 - What now?\\
169 - Nothing. I'm just used to sleeping\\
170 - on the other side of the bed.\\
171 - Yeah, so?\\
172 - So I usually sleep on my left side,\\
173 - which faces me towards the edge of the mattress.\\
174 - But here, I'm facing the back of your head--which is fine;\\
175 - there are certainly times when I enjoy seeing it\\
176 - from that angle--\\
177 - but, you know, when I'm trying to sleep,\\
178 - it's a little disconcerting.\\
179 - Well, I'm sorry, but this is my side.\\
180 - But you sleep on the other side at my house.\\
181 - Because it's your house; this is my house.\\
182 - But I'm a guest.\\
183 - And I'm the guest at your house.\\
184 - That's different. How?\\
185 - Give me a minute.\\
186 - Good night, Charlie.\\
187 - Boy, you're being pretty inflexible.\\
188 - Oh, you think I'm inflexible.\\
189 - Well, not physically,\\
190 - but you got to admit in this regard,\\
191 - you're a little stubborn.\\
192 - Good night, Charlie.\\
193 - Okay. Good night.\\
194 - How about this?\\
195 - If we switch sides and an armed intruder came in,\\
196 - I could leap up and protect you.\\
197 - But this way, you're pretty much guaranteed\\
198 - to catch the first bullet.\\
199 - What if he comes through the window?\\
200 - Oh, great.\\
201 - Now I'm never gonna get to sleep.\\
202 - ALAN: Jake?\\
203 - (TV turns off)\\
204 - You'd better not be watching TV.\\
205 - (sighs)\\
206 - Ah.\\
207 - Maybe he's upstairs.\\
208 - (doorknob rattling)\\
209 - Uh-oh.\\
210 - (subtle clattering outside)\\
211 - (clattering continues)\\
212 - (dog barks)\\
213 - (car approaching)\\
214 - (sighs deeply)\\
215 - It's like trying to sleep in the freaking jungle.\\
216 - (cat snarls)\\
217 - (screams)\\
218 - What's going on?\\
219 - Nothing, nothing.\\
220 - I was going to the bathroom, and I stepped on a cat.\\
221 - You don't have to sneak out.\\
222 - If you want to leave, leave.\\
223 - Whoa, I'd say someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed.\\
224 - But I don't want to revisit that topic.\\
225 - Good-bye, Charlie.\\
226 - Gee, you sound kind of angry.\\
227 - Why would I be angry?\\
228 - Just because I drive\\
229 - to Malibu every night for a month,\\
230 - and you won't stay even one night with me?\\
231 - Well, that and, you know, possibly crippling your cat.\\
232 - Go home, Charlie.\\
233 - Are you sure?\\
234 - I'm begging you.\\
235 - Okay, if that's what you want.\\
236 - So tomorrow at my place?\\
237 - You make love like a woman, but you throw like a man.\\
238 - * Men...\\
239 - Jake?\\
240 - (yells)\\
241 - Why are you sleeping out here?\\
242 - I was, um... camping?\\
243 - Okay, well, as long as you're not watching TV.\\
244 - Oh!\\
245 - Stupid birds.\\
246 - Hey, how'd it go last night?\\
247 - I couldn't do it, Alan. I tried, but I couldn't.\\
248 - Oh, well, that happens to all men occasionally.\\
249 - Especially when you get to be our age.\\
250 - What are you talking about?\\
251 - What are you talking about?\\
252 - I'm talking about how I'm so set in my ways,\\
253 - I couldn't spend one night in a strange house.\\
254 - Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.\\
255 - I mean, there was a time when I could sleep anywhere:\\
256 - couches, floors, witness boxes, police cars, jail cells.\\
257 - That's not sleeping. That's passing out.\\
258 - I'm not gonna argue semantics with you.\\
259 - The point is I was really uncomfortable over there.\\
260 - Even if I could have gotten to sleep,\\
261 - the morning would have been a disaster.\\
262 - How so?\\
263 - Think about it.\\
264 - After I had my morning coffee,\\
265 - where would I go to do my business?\\
266 - Oh, right, you always want\\
267 - to have home-field advantage for that.\\
268 - She's got one of those wooden toilet seats.\\
269 - It would've been like sitting on Pinocchio's mouth.\\
270 - You ever wonder about people who can poop in a gas station?\\
271 - What is wrong with them?\\
272 - What about Porta-Potties?\\
273 - Those aren't people. Those are animals.\\
274 - I'd rather go in the trunk of my car.\\
275 - I have.\\
276 - You've gone in the trunk of your car?\\
277 - No, yours.\\
278 - That was you?!\\
279 - I convinced myself a coyote had gotten in there.\\
280 - (playing "Smoke On the Water" amateurishly)\\
281 - What the hell are you doing?!\\
282 - Playing "Smoke On the Water."\\
283 - With your tongue?\\
284 - Pretty cool, huh?\\
285 - No, that is not cool. It's disgusting.\\
286 - Alan, get in here!\\
287 - What now?\\
288 - Your kid's licking my piano.\\
289 - Jake, don't lick your uncle's piano.\\
290 - I'm bored.\\
291 - Go read a book.\\
292 - I don't want to read a book.\\
293 - Then go lick a book.\\
294 - How long is this whole grounding thing gonna go on for?\\
295 - Two weeks.\\
296 - Two weeks?\\
297 - Charlie, he stuck his ass out a bus window\\
298 - at the girls' track team.\\
299 - That's what you're punishing him for?\\
300 - When you were his age, you mooned the girls' choir.\\
301 - No, when I was his age, you pantsed me\\
302 - in front of the girls' choir.\\
303 - Oh, right.\\
304 - Well, either way, you made the yearbook.\\
305 - Berta, I'm leaving.\\
306 - Hang on!\\
307 - Where you going?\\
308 - I talked Chelsea into giving me another chance\\
309 - to spend the night at her place.\\
310 - Here's your overnight bag.\\
311 - Thank you.\\
312 - All that's for one night?\\
313 - One night and one morning business meeting with Pinocchio.\\
314 - I got your flip-flops for the shower,\\
315 - your personal bath towel, hand towel and washcloth,\\
316 - your hand soap, face soap and shampoo.\\
317 - Great.\\
318 - One handheld TV, your goose-down pillow,\\
319 - Egyptian cotton pillowcase and sheets\\
320 - and a ziplock baggie of your special blend French roast coffee.\\
321 - Terrific.\\
322 - One jar of seedless raspberry jam, a mild laxative\\
323 - and one roll of quilted toilet paper with lanolin.\\
324 - Okay.\\
325 - Culver City, here I come.\\
326 - He ain't gonna make it.\\
327 - Not a chance.\\
328 - You know, I have never once seen him eat seedless raspberry jam.\\
329 - That's because you've never applied a thin layer\\
330 - to your hindquarters.\\
331 - * Men...\\
332 - I'm so glad you decided\\
333 - this was important to you, Charlie.\\
334 - Well, you're important to me.\\
335 - What are you doing?\\
336 - I brought my sheets.\\
337 - You wanna grab the other side?\\
338 - What's wrong with my sheets?\\
339 - Nothing, nothing. But mine are better.\\
340 - Egyptian cotton.\\
341 - Like, eight-million thread count.\\
342 - And good news.\\
343 - I solved the wrong-side- of-the-bed situation.\\
344 - Okay...\\
345 - I'll just sleep with my head down there.\\
346 - That way, I'm facing the right way.\\
347 - But then your feet will be in my face.\\
348 - Way ahead of you.\\
349 - Peppermint foot lotion.\\
350 - You'll think you're sleepin' in Candyland.\\
351 - Oh, before I forget.\\
352 - Toilet paper?\\
353 - Don't get your hopes up, but I'm gonna make the effort.\\
354 - * Men...\\
355 - Hey, Jake?\\
356 - You out here?\\
357 - Seen my kid?\\
358 - (TV blasting)\\
359 - What the hell?\\
360 - Can I have some privacy, please?\\
361 - Get out of the tub. Out of the tub.\\
362 - Fine.\\
363 - You're unbelievable. Is TV that important to you?\\
364 - Do you really have to ask?\\
365 - Go to your room.\\
366 - Fine, but check out Uncle Charlie's toilet seat.\\
367 - It heats up.\\
368 - Just go!\\
369 - Can I have this raspberry jam?\\
370 - Don't touch the jam!\\
371 - Oh...\\
372 - Toasty.\\
373 - If only I could poop at night.\\
374 - Maybe I'll just pee girly style.\\
375 - * Men...\\
376 - Charlie...\\
377 - (gasps)\\
378 - What?\\
379 - This isn't working for me.\\
380 - My feet too minty?\\
381 - It's not your feet.\\
382 - Well, it is your feet, but it's also the sheets,\\
383 - the pillows, the towels, the TV, the electric toothbrush.\\
384 - It's not a toothbrush.\\
385 - It's an ultrasonic dental appliance.\\
386 - It's probably got more vibrations per minute\\
387 - than that plastic egg you keep in your nightstand.\\
388 - That's right.\\
389 - I do have one of those.\\
390 - Go home.\\
391 - But I want to spend the night here.\\
392 - No, no, I made a mistake.\\
393 - From now on, we'll stay at your place.\\
394 - Oh, okay.\\
395 - Your call.\\
396 - I'm nothing if not flexible.\\
397 - (cat yowls)\\
398 - You really should put a bell on that thing.\\
399 - * Men...\\
400 - Hello, Mr. Bed.\\
401 - I'll be with you in a minute\\
402 - after I pay my respects to Professor Toilet.\\
403 - Hello.

3 - Hi, Mom.\\
4 - Alan wants to talk to you.\\
5 - Hi, Mom.\\
6 - How was Dubai?\\
7 - Oh, good, I-I'm glad you met somebody.\\
8 - Yes, yes, they are a hairy people.\\
9 - Uh, yeah, I-I don't need to know any more details,\\
10 - as long as he makes you happy.\\
11 - That's a detail, Mom.\\
12 - Oh, no, d-don't worry about your house.\\
13 - I, uh, I check on it every day on my way home from work.\\
14 - Yeah, now, that's why I'm the good son.\\

16 - Well, uh... have fun with Hamid.\\
17 - That's another detail, Mom.\\
18 - Yeah, I'll, uh, I'll see you tomorrow.\\
19 - Okay, bye-bye.\\
20 - You haven't been to her house once, have you?\\
21 - I checked on it with Google Earth.\\
22 - It's still there.\\
23 - At least the roof is anyway.\\
24 - I'll just run over today\\
25 - and pick up the newspapers and the mail, and, uh,\\
26 - replace the dead plants.\\
27 - You don't think she'll notice new plants?\\
28 - Nah, she doesn't pay that much attention to living things.\\
29 - Remember when she had the cockatoo?\\
30 - Oh, yeah.\\
31 - Polly really wanted a cracker.\\
32 - Hey, listen, as long as you're going to be in Beverly Hills,\\
33 - you can drop my Mercedes off at the dealership for service.\\
34 - Happy to do it. Hey, I don't want to hear it.\\
35 - You and your kid live here rent-free.\\
36 - I don't ask for much in return,\\
37 - so the least you could do for me,\\
38 - Alan... Charlie, Charlie.\\
39 - I said I'm happy to do it.\\
40 - Oh.\\
41 - Damn, I was all set to bust your balls.\\
42 - Sorry to disappoint you.\\
43 - And just so we're clear, my car is cherry,\\
44 - so if you bang it, ding it, dent it,\\
45 - or even change the ass-print in the seat,\\
46 - just keep driving till you get to Mexico,\\
47 - then bury yourself in the desert.\\
48 - I understand your concern, and trust me,\\
49 - I will be very careful.\\
50 - You know, you're taking all the fun out of this.\\
51 - Okay, "get car serviced."\\
52 - Check.\\
53 - What's next?\\
54 - Oh, nap time.\\
55 - (clears throat)\\

69 - You okay?\\
70 - No, I landed on my ass bone.\\
71 - Sack up. You'll be fine.\\
72 - Would you grab my sunglasses while you're down there?\\
73 - "Recover sunglasses."\\
74 - Check.\\
75 - Thanks.\\
76 - What's so interesting over there?\\
77 - Nothing.\\
78 - Hey, you know the rule: if there's topless sunbathers,\\
79 - you don't hang out and stare at them.\\
80 - You come get your Uncle Charlie.\\
81 - Nobody's topless.\\
82 - Oh.\\
83 - Then what are you looking at?\\
84 - Son of a bitch.\\
85 - Uncheck.\\
86 - Just some new neighbors.\\
87 - New neighbors, huh?\\
88 - What's the deal?\\
89 - They making s'mores on the barbecue?\\
90 - No. Chicken?\\
91 - It has nothing to do with food.\\
92 - Oh... a girl.\\
93 - Is she cute?\\
94 - No, I'm hanging off the balcony\\
95 - to look at a mutant.\\
96 - Don't get snippy.\\
97 - I was just showing an interest.\\
98 - Why don't you go over there and introduce yourself?\\
99 - I can't do that. It'd look desperate.\\
100 - You are desperate.\\
101 - Come on. We'll both go.\\
102 - Really?\\
103 - Yeah, why not?\\
104 - I got a little window before my next nap.\\
105 - Thanks.\\
106 - No problem.\\
107 - What am I going to say?\\
108 - I don't know.\\
109 - Try saying hello.\\
110 - Hello? That's all you got?\\
111 - That's all I got that you can use.\\
112 - * Men. *\\
113 - I should have peed before we left.\\
114 - You've just got a nervous bladder.\\
115 - Wait till you turn 40.\\
116 - You'll feel like you have to pee while you're still peeing.\\
117 - You ready to do this? No.\\
118 - Oh, come on, what's the worst thing that could happen?\\
119 - She laughs at me?\\
120 - Oh, that is so sweet.\\
121 - No, the worst thing that could happen\\
122 - is she falls in love with you, you get married.\\
123 - Ten, 12 years later she comes to her senses, leaves you,\\
124 - takes all your stuff, and you have to go live in your car.\\
125 - Whoa.\\
126 - Yeah.\\
127 - (doorbell rings)\\
128 - What kind of car do you think I'll have?\\
129 - Hello.\\
130 - Hi.\\
131 - I'm Charlie Harper, and this is Jake.\\
132 - We live next door.\\
133 - Right, Jake?\\
134 - I'm Jake.\\
135 - Hi, I'm Celeste.\\
136 - I'm Jake.\\
137 - Honey, is that the cable guy?\\
138 - No, Dad, it's our neighbors.\\
139 - Jerome Burnett.\\
140 - Hi.\\
141 - Charlie Harper.\\
142 - This is my nephew Jake.\\
143 - We just came by to welcome you to the neighborhood.\\
144 - Well, that was very nice of you.\\
145 - Yeah, welcome to the neighborhood.\\
146 - Bye.\\
147 - Hang on. Hang on.\\
148 - Do you know who this man is?\\
149 - Yeah, her dad. Bye.\\
150 - This is Jerome Burnett,\\
151 - one of the great NFL players of all time.\\
152 - You're very kind. Thank you.\\
153 - You know what his nickname was, Jake?\\
154 - No.\\
155 - Tell him.\\
156 - Mad Dog.\\
157 - That's great.\\
158 - Can I use your bathroom?\\
159 - Honey, show him where it is.\\
160 - Come on, Jake.\\
161 - Lady in the house, Jake. Put the seat back down.\\
162 - So what have you been up to lately?\\
163 - Oh, still working for the Chargers.\\
164 - You know, mostly front office stuff.\\
165 - Really?\\
166 - So you probably have access to tickets and such.\\
167 - I do. Do you want me to hook you up?\\
168 - Oh, gee, I don't want to impose.\\
169 - I just came by to say hello.\\
170 - Can you get me a sky box?\\
171 - I'll see what I can do.\\
172 - That'd be great.\\
173 - And I'm guessing if a, if a player got injured,\\
174 - you'd probably be one of the first to know about it.\\
175 - You know, even before the, uh,\\
176 - what do you call 'em-- bookies?\\
177 - Don't push it, Charlie.\\
178 - Hey, Dad, would it be all right\\
179 - if Jake and I take a walk on the beach?\\
180 - Yeah, sure, why not?\\
181 - Thanks. See you later.\\
182 - Isn't that nice?\\
183 - That boy touches my daughter,\\
184 - I'm going to be touching you.\\
185 - Understood.\\
186 - (clears throat)\\
187 - Can I use your bathroom?\\
188 - * Men. *\\
189 - Here you go, Mr. Harper.\\
190 - Oh, oh, thank you.\\
191 - Mmm... cappuccino.\\
192 - I wonder what they're serving at the domestic dealerships.\\
193 - They do take good care of you here.\\
194 - Of course, they ought to,\\
195 - considering what we paid for our cars.\\
196 - Oh, yeah.\\
197 - They are expensive.\\
198 - Is that your CL65 outside?\\
199 - Uh... yes, it is mine.\\
200 - How do you like it?\\
201 - What's not to like?\\
202 - It does everything but trim your toenails.\\
203 - (chuckling)\\
204 - Or maybe it does and I just haven't found the button yet.\\
205 - Not that I need to trim my toenails.\\
206 - Did 'em last night.\\
207 - Over the tub.\\
208 - Clip, ping, clip, ping!\\
209 - Diane.\\
210 - Alan.\\
211 - (both chuckle)\\
212 - So you live around here, Alan?\\
213 - Uh, no, I live down by the beach.\\
214 - Santa Monica? Uh, Malibu.\\
215 - Ooh, Malibu.\\
216 - (chuckles)\\
217 - Yep.\\
218 - Malibu.\\
219 - Yeah, uh, we just call it "the Boo."\\
220 - You know, like, "Hey, how are things down at the Boo?"\\
221 - Mr. Harper, your car is ready.\\
222 - Oh, uh, thank you. I'll, uh, I'll be right there.\\
223 - Well, uh, looks like I'm all done here.\\
224 - Guess I'll, uh, head back to the Boo.\\
225 - Don't rub it in.\\
226 - They told me I'd be here all day.\\
227 - Oh, that's terrible.\\
228 - And I'm starving.\\
229 - Oh, well, they have the little croissants\\
230 - and the, uh, and the chocolate chip cookies.\\
231 - Or, uh, maybe I could take you out for a nice lunch.\\
232 - That would be lovely, Alan.\\
233 - Thank you. Well, terrific.\\
234 - Let's go. (both chuckling)\\
235 - This never happened with the Volvo.\\
236 - * Men. *\\
237 - (doorbell rings)\\
238 - It's 5:00.\\
239 - Thanks. I almost slept through happy hour.\\
240 - Where's my little girl?\\
241 - They're not back yet?\\
242 - Why else would I be here?\\
243 - Honestly, I was thinking happy hour.\\
244 - Let me give Jake a call, see what's keeping 'em.\\
245 - Yeah, you do that.\\
246 - Did you try calling your daughter?\\
247 - She left her cell phone at the house.\\
248 - (chuckles)\\
249 - Kids, huh?\\
250 - It's ringing.\\
251 - (over phone): * Yo, bitch, I'm gonna slap you up *\\
252 - * Yo, bitch, I'll slap you up *\\
253 - * Yo, bitch, I'm gonna slap you up... *\\
254 - Oh, that's unfortunate on so many levels.\\
255 - (music continues indistinctly over phone)\\
256 - * Yo, bitch, I'm gonna slap you up *\\
257 - * Yo, bitch, I'll slap you up\\
258 - (music continues indistinctly over phone)\\
259 - * Yo, bitch, I'm gonna slap you up *\\
260 - * Yo, bitch, I'll slap you up\\
261 - * Yo, bitch, I'm gonna slap you up *\\
262 - * Yo, bitch, I'll slap you up\\
263 - * Yo, bitch, I'm gonna slap you up *\\
264 - * Yo, bitch, I'll slap you up\\
265 - * Yo, bitch, I'm gonna slap you up *\\
266 - * Yo, bitch, I'll slap you up\\
267 - * Yo, bitch, I'm gonna slap you up *\\
268 - * Yo, bitch, I'll slap you up... *\\
269 - * Men. *\\
270 - This is just my pied-  -terre.\\
271 - I spend most of my time out at the beach house.\\
272 - Looks like you haven't been here in a while.\\
273 - Oh, just two weeks.\\
274 - Don't you have someone to come in to water your plants?\\
275 - Oh, I do, but he's incredibly unreliable.\\
276 - My brother.\\
277 - Oh. A bit of a mooch.\\
278 - So, now that we're here,\\
279 - what do you want to do?\\
280 - Ah, gee, I don't know, I...\\
281 - Oh, well, that's an option.\\
282 - (ringtone playing)\\
283 - Oh, excuse me.\\
284 - Alan Harper speaking.\\
285 - (hushed): I know who's speaking, you dill weed.\\
286 - We've got a problem here.\\
287 - Oh, really?\\
288 - It's the mooch at the Boo.\\
289 - So, uh, what's the problem?\\
290 - Not the wine cellar again, is it?\\
291 - What are you talking about, you gibbering moron?\\
292 - Good, good.\\
293 - Listen to me, your idiot son's about to get me killed.\\
294 - Oh, so he's okay?\\
295 - He's great. Probably having the time of his life.\\
296 - I'm the one in trouble.\\
297 - Uh, well, I-I-I trust you to take care of it.\\
298 - Thanks for the update.\\
299 - Take a bottle of Pinot for yourself.\\
300 - Alan?\\
301 - Oh!\\
302 - My God, I thought there was an eclipse.\\
303 - Excuse me, I need to go to the bathroom again.\\
304 - (both moaning pleasurably)\\
305 - (giggling)\\
306 - Oh! I knew it.\\
307 - You're married.\\
308 - Oh, oh, no-no-no. I'm not married.\\
309 - This is, uh, this is just, uh...\\
310 - A silk evening gown.\\
311 - Actually, I think it's chiffon.\\
312 - You men are all the same.\\
313 - No, no, no, wait. Diane, Diane...\\
314 - You've got the wrong idea.\\
315 - There's something you don't know about me.\\
316 - You're gay? No.\\
317 - You're a cross-dresser? No.\\
318 - 'Cause, you know, I could really get into that.\\
319 - Yes!\\
320 - I'm a big, ol' cross-dresser.\\
321 - Sorry it took so long.\\
322 - I had a little accident.\\
323 - Come on, you and me are going to go out\\
324 - and find those kids.\\
325 - Jerome, Jerome, hang on.\\
326 - What?! Oh!\\
327 - Still pretty nimble.\\
328 - Let's sit down,\\
329 - take a deep breath, and talk this through for a minute.\\
330 - Come on, big fella.\\
331 - Please?\\
332 - Make it quick.\\
333 - Okay, here's the deal.\\
334 - Jake is harmless.\\
335 - You don't have a thing to worry about,\\
336 - unless your daughter's made out of doughnuts.\\
337 - Which I'm assuming she's not.\\
338 - Look, Celeste is all I've got.\\
339 - You don't know what it's like being a single father.\\
340 - You're right. I don't.\\
341 - But I do know what it's like\\
342 - to exploit women with daddy issues.\\
343 - What the hell are you talking about?\\
344 - Believe me, if you don't trust your daughter\\
345 - to make her own decisions, if you try to control her life,\\
346 - she's just going to grow up to resent you.\\
347 - And the next thing you know,\\
348 - she'll be trying to punish you by going out\\
349 - with some weaselly little con artist like, well, me.\\
350 - And you can't kill us all.\\
351 - I can try.\\
352 - Let me start again.\\
353 - ALAN: Uh, uh, uh, are you sure this is what you want?\\
354 - Oh, yeah, baby.\\
355 - It's always been one of my fantasies.\\
356 - Oh, okay.\\
357 - Just a little heads-up:\\
358 - I'm wearing the panties, but I'm not bikini-safe.\\
359 - Ugh, my ass looks huge in this.\\
360 - Diane? (engine starts)\\
361 - (tires screeching)\\
362 - Oh, no. Oh, no!\\
363 - Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!\\
364 - Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!\\
365 - Not bad.\\
366 - (door closes)\\
367 - Oh, no! Oh, no!\\
368 - Yes, yes, my car has been stolen.\\
369 - Yes, just now.\\
370 - If you hurry, you ca...\\
371 - Sure, I'll hold.\\
372 - EVELYN: Why am I not surprised?\\
373 - Did it have to be my red chiffon?\\
374 - * Men. *\\
375 - (sobbing): Then after I blew out my knee,\\
376 - my wife left me.\\
377 - Oh, man, I'm sorry.\\
378 - For a place kicker.\\
379 - Ooh, insult to injury.\\
380 - A little, tiny dude from Serbia.\\
381 - Not a single vowel in his entire name.\\
382 - Oh, yeah, Grl Zrbnck.\\
383 - That guy could sure split the uprights.\\
384 - In a football manner of speaking.\\
385 - And ever since then, it's just been me and Celeste.\\
386 - Sure, sure.\\
387 - I don't know what I'd do\\
388 - if anything ever happened to her, Charlie.\\
389 - I'd go crazy.\\
390 - I'd go crazy just thinking about it.\\
391 - Well, then, for God's sake, don't think about it.\\
392 - Come on. Come on.\\
393 - Let's get you home.\\
394 - Thanks, Charlie. You're okay.\\
395 - No problem.\\
396 - You just kick back and relax.\\
397 - And when Celeste walks through that door,\\
398 - all you've got to do is act like nothing's happened.\\
399 - You think something happened?\\
400 - No, no, no, nothing happened.\\
401 - Which is why it's not really acting.\\
402 - And it will show your daughter that you trust her.\\
403 - Okay, I'll give it a shot.\\
404 - You won't be sorry. I promise.\\
405 - Okay.\\
406 - Hey, come over to the house.\\
407 - I've got a couple of tickets\\
408 - for Sunday's game I want to lay on you.\\
409 - Oh, you don't have to do that.\\
410 - I'll just grab my keys. Okay, let's go.\\
411 - * Men. *\\
412 - Whatever happened to the guy you tackled\\
413 - in the Tampa Bay game? Robinson?\\
414 - He's walking again.\\
415 - Celeste!\\
416 - Oh! Hi, Dad.\\
417 - Hey, Mr. Mad Dog.\\
418 - Am I going to be walking again?\\
419 - * Men. *\\
420 - Listen, Jake.\\
421 - I'm real proud that you stepped up\\
422 - and got a little action tonight,\\
423 - but I've got to ask you something.\\
424 - What?\\
425 - Are you out of your freakin' mind?!\\
426 - I'm sorry.\\
427 - We just lost track of time.\\
428 - Yeah, well, thanks to you,\\
429 - I've got to change my shorts for the second time today.\\
430 - Oh, there's my phone.\\
431 - Who are you calling? Celeste.\\
432 - No-no, no, no, no, no, cool it with Celeste.\\
433 - And change your ringtone.\\
434 - (knocking)\\
435 - Now what?\\
436 - I'll be with you in a minute.\\
437 - Jake, go to your room.\\
438 - No matter what you hear, do not come out.\\
439 - What? Just go!\\
440 - Look,\\
441 - I spoke to the kid.\\
442 - He's not going to bother your daughter anymore.\\
443 - So whatever you gotta do, do it to me.\\
444 - I'm sorry, buddy.\\
445 - I overreacted.\\
446 - Okay.\\
447 - Celeste told me everything.\\
448 - She told me your boy was a perfect gentleman\\
449 - and that she wanted to kiss him.\\
450 - She wanted to kiss him?\\
451 - You may have bigger problems than you thought.\\
452 - Hey, here's two tickets for the game.\\
453 - You take Jake; I'll bring Celeste.\\
454 - We'll make a day of it.\\
455 - Oh, thanks. That's... that's great!\\
456 - Excuse me. Sorry.\\
457 - Okay, well...\\
458 - See you Sunday. Sure.\\
459 - Alan! Where's my car?!\\
460 - Why are you wearing a dress?!\\
461 - Alan! (knocking)\\
462 - Why aren't you in Mexico?!
\subsection {Episode 10: He Smelled the Ham, He Got Excited}
1 - * Men. *\\
2 - EVELYN: Jake.\\
3 - You're hardly touching your salad.\\
4 - I promised Berta I'd cut down on the roughage.\\
5 - Well, all right.\\
6 - Why don't I get the soup.\\
7 - Based on the salad, I'm not so optimistic.\\
8 - So you have absolutely no idea why she invited us here?\\
9 - All she said on the phone was "dinner."\\
10 - And you believed her?\\
11 - Good God, man,\\
12 - do you realize what you've done?\\
13 - Just relax.\\
14 - "Just relax"?\\
15 - We'll be lucky to leave here\\
16 - with all of our limbs and gonads.\\
17 - What's a gonad?\\
18 - You are.\\
19 - So it's bad.\\
20 - You're not a gonad.\\
21 - Says the other gonad.\\
22 - Here we go.\\
23 - Potato leek soup.\\
24 - Oh, delightful.\\
25 - You got any crackers?\\
26 - "Crackers"?\\
27 - Yeah, I like having something crunchy in my soup.\\
28 - Little goldfish, crouton, a stale bagel...\\
29 - I'll check.\\
30 - Go ahead and start.\\
31 - Captain Crunch will work in a pinch.\\
32 - I've got a bad feeling about this, Alan.\\
33 - What? We're having a nice dinner with our mother.\\
34 - So you feel it, too?\\
35 - What kind of person doesn't serve crackers with soup?\\
36 - The only thing I have that's crunchy is macadamia nuts.\\
37 - Interesting. Let's give 'er a try.\\
38 - Well, I suppose you boys are wondering\\
39 - why I asked you here.\\
40 - You mean this isn't just a nice, warm family dinner?\\
41 - Knock it off, Charlie.\\
42 - I have some good news.\\
43 - And no, I'm not dying.\\
44 - I didn't say anything.\\
45 - Why would you even go there?\\
46 - Okay, I'm sorry.\\
47 - Anyway, I have been doing some financial planning.\\
48 - So you're thinking about dying?\\
49 - Trust me, darling, I promise to stick around long enough\\
50 - to identify your bloated, gin-soaked, syphilitic remains.\\
51 - Okay, so we've got a time frame.\\
52 - So what about your financial plan?\\
53 - Yes, well, one thing I've done\\
54 - is to set aside enough money to ensure\\
55 - that my grandson will get a college education.\\
56 - You're gonna buy a college?\\
57 - I have set up a trust fund.\\
58 - Oh, Mom, Mom, that is, uh,\\
59 - that is very generous, but, uh, I actually\\
60 - started a college fund for Jake when he was born.\\
61 - Really?\\
62 - How much you have in there now?\\
63 - Uh...\\
64 - Did you hear? Grandma's sending you to college.\\
65 - Now? I haven't finished my soup.\\
66 - Mom, have you thought this through?\\
67 - Look at him.\\
68 - Maybe there should be one child left behind.\\
69 - Charlie, Charlie, shush.\\
70 - Mom, I-I cannot tell you\\
71 - how much I appreciate this.\\
72 - Jake, do you understand\\
73 - what your grandma is providing here?\\
74 - Yeah, more school.\\
75 - Big whoop.\\
76 - Well, Jake, perhaps this will help enthuse you.\\
77 - If you buckle down and your grades improve,\\
78 - when the time comes for you to go to college,\\
79 - Grandmommy is going to buy you a new car.\\
80 - I love you, Grandmommy!\\
81 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
82 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
83 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
84 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
85 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
86 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
87 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
88 - * Men. *\\
89 - By the way, when I get my car from Grandma,\\
90 - one of you guys is gonna have to park on the street.\\
91 - The car is for college.\\
92 - And what makes you think you'll still be living here?\\
93 - Oh, come on, you know you love me.\\
94 - He's got you there. You do love him.\\
95 - Yeah, but he doesn't have to rub my nose in it.\\
96 - So what do you think Mom's angle is?\\
97 - Does she have to have an angle?\\
98 - A college trust fund?\\
99 - For him?\\
100 - Last week he bit his hand eating a sandwich.\\
101 - He smelled the ham. He got excited.\\
102 - Maybe she's just trying to buy his love.\\
103 - Alan, think it through.\\
104 - She could've done that with a pork chop\\
105 - and a Creamsicle.\\
106 - Well, whatever it is, it is a big load off my mind\\
107 - knowing his education's taken care of.\\
108 - Oh, yeah, that's what Mom wants,\\
109 - to take a load off your mind.\\
110 - Okay, why do you think she did it?\\
111 - I don't know.\\
112 - But if you want to get inside her head,\\
113 - you've got to start thinking more twisted,\\
114 - manipulative, devious.\\
115 - For example,\\
116 - if by some miracle he gets through college\\
117 - and she sends him to law school...\\
118 - L-law school? You've already lost me.\\
119 - Maybe she's boinking the dean of admissions.\\
120 - We don't know. Just hear me out.\\
121 - Go on.\\
122 - Let's say he crawls through law school,\\
123 - takes seven or eight shots at passing the bar.\\
124 - We know how that ends.\\
125 - So what are his options as a failed lawyer?\\
126 - I don't know. Government work?\\
127 - Exactly.\\
128 - Maybe he lands on the zoning commission.\\
129 - And bingo-bango, Mom finally gets\\
130 - to put a second story on her house.\\
131 - You really think she's going to send him to college\\
132 - and law school just so she can add an extra bedroom?\\
133 - That's insane.\\
134 - Is it, Alan?\\
135 - Is it really?\\
136 - * Men. *\\
137 - Morning.\\
138 - Morning.\\
139 - Alan?\\
140 - Yeah?\\
141 - You having a stroke?\\
142 - No, no, I'm just,\\
143 - I'm just trying to figure out\\
144 - why I need to go to work today.\\
145 - I mean,\\
146 - Mom's taking care of Jake's education,\\
147 - buying him a car.\\
148 - Why should I bust my hump?\\
149 - For your self-respect?\\
150 - Nah, Judith got that in the divorce.\\
151 - 'Cause you like to heal people's back pain\\
152 - with your chiropractic magic?\\
153 - (chortles)\\
154 - Okay, well, you've got to go somewhere.\\
155 - Why?\\
156 - 'Cause you're creeping me out.\\
157 - I should take up motivational speaking.\\
158 - Morning.\\
159 - Something's wrong with your brother.\\
160 - We don't say the word "wrong."\\
161 - We say "special."\\
162 - No, it's true. My friends don't think you're my grandma.\\
163 - They think you're my young aunt.\\
164 - If he gets his nose any further up her keister,\\
165 - we're gonna have to tie a rope to his feet.\\
166 - Hey, I was thinking.\\
167 - You know what would be a nice, safe vehicle for me?\\
168 - A used police car.\\
169 - I don't know. I guess from the police?\\
170 - She's buying Lunkhead a car?\\
171 - And a college education. Ha.\\
172 - Well, I guess that makes sense\\
173 - if it's a clown college and the car seats 20.\\
174 - All right, then I'll see you in an hour.\\
175 - Hold on.\\
176 - Nah, I don't need one.\\
177 - Okay, okay, bye.\\
178 - I'm gonna spend the afternoon with Grandma.\\
179 - If she asks, I took a shower.\\
180 - Figured out her angle yet?\\
181 - No. And that's what scares me.\\
182 - (ominous): * Bom-bom-bom.\\
183 - Seemed appropriate.\\
184 - * Men. *\\
185 - All right, Mr. Sharipa.\\
186 - How's it feel right here?\\
187 - A little tender.\\
188 - Yeah, yeah, you've got a spasm right here.\\
189 - It's my own fault.\\
190 - I was trying to do it in the shower\\
191 - with Mrs. Sharipa last night.\\
192 - The woman is no ballerina.\\
193 - Well, sex in the shower is really a young man's game.\\
194 - Or a middle-aged man with a skinny wife.\\
195 - Sure.\\
196 - What can I say?\\
197 - I like a little junk in the trunk.\\
198 - I, I think that says it.\\
199 - Slap her on the ass at Christmas,\\
200 - it doesn't stop shaking till New Year's Eve.\\
201 - Just between you and me,\\
202 - she enjoys a little spanking from Santa.\\
203 - Who doesn't?\\
204 - I check the list twice:\\
205 - always naughty.\\
206 - Uh-huh. Could you, uh,\\
207 - turn on your right, Mr. Sharipa.\\
208 - I'll, uh, try to relieve\\
209 - the pressure on your sciatic nerve.\\
210 - Would you cross your arms, please?\\
211 - Uh-huh. Thank you.\\
212 - Okay.\\
213 - (passing gas)\\
214 - Excuse me.\\
215 - Oh, no, that, uh, that happens.\\
216 - It's, uh, it's perfectly natural...\\
217 - Oh, dear Lord.\\
218 - Yeah, that's the garlic clams I had for lunch.\\
219 - I like them. They don't like me.\\
220 - Um, if you'll just excuse me for a moment.\\
221 - Hey, you know, I feel better.\\
222 - Maybe that's where the pressure came from.\\
223 - Where are you going, Dr. Harper?\\
224 - Home.\\
225 - Will you be coming back?\\
226 - Dr. Harper?\\
227 - Oh, my God.\\
228 - * Men. *\\
229 - Oh, check it out.\\
230 - This SUV comes with a mini-fridge\\
231 - in the glove compartment.\\
232 - Fascinating.\\
233 - Let's spend a little time\\
234 - talking about our college plans.\\
235 - "Our plans"?\\
236 - Are you going, too? 'Cause that changes everything.\\
237 - I've already been to college, darling.\\
238 - And they were some of the happiest years of my life.\\
239 - Really? Mm-hmm.\\
240 - What kind of car did you have?\\
241 - Look, Jake, I understand that you're excited\\
242 - about getting a car, but keep in mind\\
243 - the car is predicated on you getting into college.\\
244 - Right.\\
245 - What's "predicated" mean?\\
246 - No college, no car.\\
247 - Oh.\\
248 - What if I flunk out?\\
249 - Do I have to give the car back?\\
250 - Oh, sweetheart,\\
251 - what makes you think you'd flunk out?\\
252 - Well, history.\\
253 - Right now there's a 60/60 chance\\
254 - I'm gonna have to repeat eighth grade.\\
255 - 60/60, huh?\\
256 - At least.\\
257 - It could be 70/40.\\
258 - Well, we can rule out the Ivy League.\\
259 - Is that good?\\
260 - For the Ivy League.\\
261 - You know, dear,\\
262 - maybe we're going about this the wrong way.\\
263 - College should be about pursuing the things you love.\\
264 - What do you love?\\
265 - Um, TV, video games, sleeping.\\
266 - I love sleeping so much\\
267 - sometimes I actually dream about it.\\
268 - Okay, maybe I wasn't clear enough.\\
269 - Oh, you know what I really love?\\
270 - Twice-dipped French toast\\
271 - with a sprinkling of orange zest.\\
272 - Orange zest?\\
273 - Yeah, you scrape it from an orange peel.\\
274 - It's what really makes my recipe work.\\
275 - You have a recipe?\\
276 - Yep.\\
277 - It kinda happened by accident.\\
278 - I was making once-dipped French toast,\\
279 - but I dropped it.\\
280 - A lot of great discoveries are accidents\\
281 - like Thomas Edison and the telephone.\\
282 - That wasn't Thomas...\\
283 - So you like to cook?\\
284 - Yeah, I love it.\\
285 - 'Cause, you know, I love to eat\\
286 - and I love to surprise my mouth.\\
287 - Well, you know, dear,\\
288 - what you are talking about is becoming a chef,\\
289 - and there are schools for that,\\
290 - and-and the potential to make a terrific living.\\
291 - Do I get to wear one of those poofy hats?\\
292 - If you want to.\\
293 - Cool. Then I guess I'll be a chef.\\
294 - My grandson the chef.\\
295 - I can live with that.\\
296 - You know what I could drive if I was a chef?\\
297 - The Oscar Mayer Weinermobile.\\
298 - * Men. *\\
299 - Hey.\\
300 - Hey.\\
301 - I got a kayak.\\
302 - I see.\\
303 - Guess what I'm gonna do?\\
304 - Go kayaking?\\
305 - Yep.\\
306 - I have decided that life is too short.\\
307 - So you're going out in the Pacific Ocean in a plastic boat.\\
308 - Good thinking.\\
309 - No, I was at work today\\
310 - and it suddenly became clear to me that...\\
311 - Sorry about that.\\
312 - It became clear to me\\
313 - that I don't like what I'm doing.\\
314 - And now that Mom is taking care of Jake,\\
315 - I can spend my time doing the things that give me joy.\\
316 - So you're gonna masturbate in a kayak?\\
317 - No, but that's the point.\\
318 - You'll have to elaborate.\\
319 - I could if I wanted to.\\
320 - Yeah, who could've seen that coming?\\
321 - Look, I'm sorry.\\
322 - * Men. *\\
323 - Here you go.\\
324 - Grilled cheese with gouda, Swiss and monster.\\
325 - You mean muenster.\\
326 - No, that's an old TV show.\\
327 - And they're called that 'cause they're monsters.\\
328 - This is a cheese.\\
329 - Anyway, the sandwich also has heirloom tomatoes\\
330 - and smoked applewood bacon on sourdough toast.\\
331 - Where did you learn this?\\
332 - Food Channel and FoodChannel.com.\\
333 - Food Channel on Demand, Food Channel magazine.\\
334 - And the school lunch lady.\\
335 - Oh, and save room for homemade potato chips.\\
336 - You're making potato chips?\\
337 - Oh, yeah, it's easy.\\
338 - You slice the potatoes real thin,\\
339 - rub the slices with lemon and garlic,\\
340 - fry 'em up in a hot iron skillet\\
341 - and then salt to taste.\\
342 - I can't get over this.\\
343 - Bon appetite. Mmm.\\
344 - Teet.\\
345 - No, that's a cow's boob.\\
346 - Oh, my goodness.\\
347 - This is delicious.\\
348 - Don't eat more than three or you won't poop for a week.\\
349 - Trust me.\\
350 - Well, at least\\
351 - we have finally found a career path for you.\\
352 - Cool. I'll go get the chips and then we'll talk about cars.\\
353 - You know what?\\
354 - Let's settle this car thing first.\\
355 - * Men. *\\
356 - Oh, God, it was incredible.\\
357 - The-the wind, the sky,\\
358 - the surf.\\
359 - I feel like I'm reborn.\\
360 - You were out there for 15 minutes.\\
361 - Yeah, well, my arms got tired.\\
362 - Oh, so you did decide to go with the kayanking.\\
363 - What?\\
364 - Masturyaking?\\
365 - You're terrible.\\
366 - But, anyway, no one could see me.\\
367 - So now what?\\
368 - Now?\\
369 - Now I just live.\\
370 - I enjoy.\\
371 - All right.\\
372 - This rat has quit the race.\\
373 - Good for you.\\
374 - This hamster is off the treadmill.\\
375 - Glad to hear it.\\
376 - This squirrel is satisfied with the nuts he has.\\
377 - No comment.\\
378 - I'm not gonna make it, Charlie.\\
379 - Didn't think you would.\\
380 - No goals, no challenges,\\
381 - no, no gut-wrenching fear driving me forward.\\
382 - I mean, how can you stand it?\\
383 - Me?\\
384 - Well, I have kind of an existential philosophy\\
385 - that shapes my outlook.\\
386 - It involves a willingness\\
387 - to let life carry me along in its wake\\
388 - as I contemplate its infinite mystery.\\
389 - Plus I drink and take a lot of naps.\\
390 - Yeah, well, I need something meaningful to strive for.\\
391 - Sorry, I don't follow.\\
392 - I need a carrot in front of me and a stick behind me.\\
393 - Without that, I... I have no reason to live.\\
394 - That's it!\\
395 - What's it?\\
396 - "No reason to live."\\
397 - That's Mom's angle.\\
398 - This never had anything to do with Jake.\\
399 - She's trying to kill you.\\
400 - Oh, come on.\\
401 - Think about it.\\
402 - She takes the financial pressure off your shoulders,\\
403 - knowing you can't live without it.\\
404 - Oh, she's good.\\
405 - Why would Mom want to kill me?\\
406 - I don't know.\\
407 - Why do I want to kill you?\\
408 - Why does your ex-wife want to kill you?\\
409 - You just bring that out in people.\\
410 - You're being ridiculous.\\
411 - Okay, okay, let's look at the alternate explanation.\\
412 - For the first time in her life,\\
413 - our mother is being totally selfless\\
414 - and thinking about someone else's well-being.\\
415 - Dear God, my own mother is trying to kill me.\\
416 - Well, I'm glad we got that settled.\\
417 - It was really bugging me.\\
418 - * Men. *\\
419 - Terrific sandwich.\\
420 - FIREMAN: Yeah.\\
421 - I think you'll find\\
422 - the fire gave everything a nice smoky flavor.\\
423 - Just out of curiosity,\\
424 - what does a used fire truck go for?\\
425 - * Men. *\\
426 - that might cheer you up.\\
427 - I'm listening.\\
428 - You need a carrot and a stick to make your life meaningful?\\
429 - How about this?\\
430 - Every month I let you give me a small amount of money\\
431 - in exchange for the pleasure of living in my house.\\
432 - We'll call it... rent.\\
433 - Wow, it's been a long time since I paid rent.\\
434 - Five years, two months, 11 days.\\
435 - Interesting.\\
436 - It would certainly give me a reason to go back to work.\\
437 - Right. That's the carrot.\\
438 - And if you fall behind, I get to hit you with a stick.\\
439 - Very funny.\\
440 - No, I'm serious.\\
441 - That's my carrot.\\
442 - Okay, how much did you have in mind?\\
443 - Well, I've given it some thought...\\
444 - ...and...\\
445 - I think you'll find this to be a fair number.\\
446 - Oh.\\
447 - Oh, well, uh,\\
448 - at least if I'm paying rent\\
449 - I'll get a say in what goes on around here.\\
450 - No, no, no, no, no, no.\\
451 - No.\\
452 - If you want a say,\\
453 - this is the number.\\
454 - I don't need a say.\\
455 - Good.\\
456 - So, every month on the first.\\
457 - Deal.\\
458 - All right, all right, I feel good about this,\\
459 - pitching in, pulling my own weight.\\
460 - It's long overdue.\\
461 - Five years, two months, 11 days.\\
462 - Right.\\
463 - Uh, of, uh, course since the month has already started,\\
464 - we'll, we'll start next month.\\
465 - Fine.\\
466 - Uh, although, uh, with the holidays coming,\\
467 - maybe it'd be better to start fresh with the new year,\\
468 - you know? 1/1.\\
469 - Sure, whatever. Okay.\\
470 - Unless the economy's still in the tank.\\
471 - Always a possibility.\\
472 - In which case, you know,\\
473 - we'll, uh, we'll probably want to revisit the number.\\
474 - Probably.\\
475 - I mean, the market is-is pretty volatile right now.\\
476 - I mean, I think some belt-tightening\\
477 - is in order for everybody, you know,\\
478 - landlords and-and tenants alike.\\
479 - (thud) ALAN: Ow!
\subsection {Episode 11: The Devil's Lube}
1 - Check it out.\\
2 - They got cars that run on vegetable oil now.\\
3 - How about that.\\
4 - You know what would be cool?\\
5 - A Hummer that runs on French fry grease.\\
6 - Uh-huh.\\
7 - We could be energy independent\\
8 - and still smash through crap.\\
9 - Sounds great.\\
10 - Plus, the new car smell is French fries.\\
11 - Okay, I'm only gonna say this one more time.\\
12 - You don't get your license for two more years\\
13 - and you're not getting a Hummer.\\
14 - You know, you say you want me to open up to you,\\
15 - but what's the point?\\
16 - (chuckling)\\
17 - Yeah, I always loved Paris in the springtime.\\
18 - Oh, you're lucky.\\
19 - I only got to do her once, on Halloween.\\
20 - Hi.\\
21 - Oh, hey, Alan.\\
22 - Andy, this is my brother Alan.\\
23 - Alan, Andy. Hello.\\
24 - Hey, Andy.\\
25 - Pull up a chair.\\
26 - We're just telling war stories.\\
27 - Oh, great.\\
28 - The sponge?\\
29 - Yeah.\\
30 - So, uh, how do you guys know each other?\\
31 - Well, Andy and I--\\
32 - Can I have a cigar?\\
33 - Sure, help yourself.\\
34 - Thank you.\\
35 - Anyway, Andy and I have known each other--\\
36 - Maybe I'll take one for now and one for later.\\
37 - Anyway, before he moved to New York,\\
38 - Andy and I were partners in crime.\\
39 - There weren't that many actual crimes.\\
40 - Unless you count the ones against nature.\\
41 - Alan, this is a great man.\\
42 - ANDY: No, no,\\
43 - Albert Einstein was a great man.\\
44 - I just drink, gamble and hump.\\
45 - But I'm great at it.\\
46 - Andy once managed to hitchhike\\
47 - from Vegas to L.A., wearing no pants.\\
48 - Hey, anybody can use their thumb.\\
49 - This right here,\\
50 - this is the brother I never had.\\
51 - Oh, well, how nice for you.\\
52 - I don't mean it that way.\\
53 - You're my brother.\\
54 - Well, thank you.\\
55 - I just like him better.\\
56 - Got it.\\
57 - *Andy is the one guy in the world\\
58 - that can match me drink for drink and broad for broad.\\
59 - In fact, the one time I thought I drank him under the table,\\
60 - it turned out he had a broad under there.\\
61 - Right, Andy?\\
62 - CHARLIE: Andy?\\
63 - Don't screw with me, dude.\\
64 - Who's your favorite brother now?\\
65 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
66 - * Men. * Oh, oh-oh. *\\
67 - * Men. *\\
68 - So, he died right out there\\
69 - in the chair, huh?\\
70 - Yep. (clicks tongue)\\
71 - Remind me to flip that cushion.\\
72 - You should've seen it, Berta.\\
73 - The paramedics zipped him up in a big plastic bag.\\
74 - Is that so?\\
75 - It looked like one of those things\\
76 - the delivery guys use to keep pizza hot.\\
77 - I wonder if they got him to the morgue\\
78 - in 30 minutes or less.\\
79 - Not funny, Jake.\\
80 - Maybe it is funny and you just didn't get it.\\
81 - Eat.\\
82 - So, uh, did you know him?\\
83 - Andy? Sure.\\
84 - Before he moved to New York,\\
85 - he and Charlie were just like brothers.\\
86 - Yeah, I heard that part.\\
87 - How's Charlie taking it?\\
88 - He's pretty shook up.\\
89 - Well, you can understand why.\\
90 - Somebody your age, living the same\\
91 - dumbass lifestyle you live\\
92 - keels over and dies.\\
93 - It's gotta give you pause.\\
94 - You're right about that.\\
95 - Actually, I'm surprised\\
96 - that Charlie didn't go first.\\
97 - Excuse me.\\
98 - I'm standing right here.\\
99 - But for how long?\\
100 - Did you get that one?\\
101 - I'll see you later. Where you going?\\
102 - Where do you think? My best friend just died.\\
103 - I got a lot of things to take care of.\\
104 - You're handling the funeral?\\
105 - I'm sure Andy would like that.\\
106 - The hell with Andy.\\
107 - I'm going to the hospital\\
108 - to get every damn medical test known to man.\\
109 - Good one.\\
110 - You're not getting any of these, are you?\\
111 - * Men. *\\
112 - Hey.\\
113 - Hey, how'd the tests go?\\
114 - I won't know for a couple of days.\\
115 - All right, I'm outta here.\\
116 - How about you, Charlie?\\
117 - Wait, I got something for you.\\
118 - It's a gift certificate for a week at a spa in Palm Springs.\\
119 - Well, I'll be.\\
120 - Thank you, Charlie.\\
121 - I just wanted you to know that I love you\\
122 - and appreciate that you've always been there for me.\\
123 - Great, see you in a week.\\
124 - Look at you.\\
125 - The minute you start thinking about your mortality,\\
126 - you realize how much you care about the people around you.\\
127 - Yeah, and I need to start showing it.\\
128 - Well, little gifts are always\\
129 - a nice way to express your feelings.\\
130 - I know.\\
131 - Could be as simple as a cashmere robe\\
132 - or as extravagant as a new car.\\
133 - Yeah, I suppose it could.\\
134 - Excuse me, I got something really cool for Jake.\\
135 - Doesn't even have to be new!\\
136 - "Certified pre-owned" is still very thoughtful!\\
137 - (knocking on door)\\
138 - Hey, what are you doing?\\
139 - I was trying to research cars, but you wouldn't believe\\
140 - what comes up when you Google "Hummer."\\
141 - Actually, I would.\\
142 - Here, I got you something\\
143 - I think you're really gonna like.\\
144 - Is it a sandwich?\\
145 - Why would I gift wrap a sandwich?\\
146 - 'Cause you want me to be surprised?\\
147 - Just open it.\\
148 - You know what's a great sandwich?\\
149 - The Monte Cristo.\\
150 - 'Cause it has ham and cheese and it's fried.\\
151 - Open the damn box.\\
152 - Whoa, don't get your period.\\
153 - Oh, wow, a mini video camera.\\
154 - Pretty cool, huh?\\
155 - Is this 'cause you think you're dying?\\
156 - No, no.\\
157 - I just wanted to do something nice for you.\\
158 - Before you die.\\
159 - Do you want the camera or not?\\
160 - Yeah, I want it.\\
161 - Then just say thank you.\\
162 - Thank you. Geez.\\
163 - You need to relax.\\
164 - You'll give yourself a heart attack.\\
165 - I'll work on it.\\
166 - Have a sandwich.\\
167 - That always relaxes me.\\
168 - All right,\\
169 - one more gift to give.\\
170 - Oh, yeah?\\
171 - Saving the best for last?\\
172 - I don't know about the best,\\
173 - but it's sure the hardest.\\
174 - Any way I can make it easier?\\
175 - Yeah.\\
176 - Call Mom and tell her I'm on my way over.\\
177 - * Men. *\\
178 - Oh, Charlie, what a beautiful watch!\\
179 - Do you really like it?\\
180 - Are you kidding?\\
181 - It's gorgeous!\\
182 - And the best part is\\
183 - now I don't have to wear my good one every day.\\
184 - Anyway, you're probably wondering\\
185 - why I bought it for you.\\
186 - Well, I just assumed you love me\\
187 - and did it out of the goodness of your heart.\\
188 - I'm kidding. Why, dear?\\
189 - Okay, I deserve that.\\
190 - But the truth is I do love you\\
191 - and despite our many differences,\\
192 - I'm glad you're my mother.\\
193 - You didn't drive over here drunk, did you?\\
194 - I'm not drunk.\\
195 - I just...\\
196 - I've been thinking a lot about how fleeting life is,\\
197 - and that none of us really knows how long we're gonna be here.\\
198 - Did you find another lump on your pee-pee?\\
199 - No, Mom, my pee-pee's fine.\\
200 - I don't know how "worn down to a nub" can be fine,\\
201 - but all right.\\
202 - My point is,\\
203 - I don't want to be angry with you anymore.\\
204 - I want us to be friends.\\
205 - I was always your friend, Charlie.\\
206 - You were just too self-involved to see it.\\
207 - Okay, I got to go.\\
208 - Where you off to?\\
209 - I have to pick out a casket for a friend of mine.\\
210 - Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.\\
211 - Yeah, well, what are you gonna do.\\
212 - Don't cheap out.\\
213 - It's one thing to do it with a watch,\\
214 - but a casket is forever.\\
215 - * Men. *\\
216 - CHARLIE: So young.\\
217 - I can't believe it.\\
218 - Yeah...\\
219 - Who'd have thought smoking, drinking and whoring\\
220 - could kill you?\\
221 - You realize that could just as easily be me in there.\\
222 - Yeah.\\
223 - Don't even think that.\\
224 - It is a nice casket, though.\\
225 - Should be.\\
226 - It cost me ten grand.\\
227 - Ten grand? Wow.\\
228 - What can I say? I take care of the people I love.\\
229 - Could've taken care of me with a freakin' robe.\\
230 - Kind of a light turnout.\\
231 - You'd probably get more people with an open bar.\\
232 - Hey, make sure there's an open bar at mine.\\
233 - Oh, now I'm your funeral planner?\\
234 - Don't you want a friend\\
235 - or someone you really care about in charge of that?\\
236 - No, you do it.\\
237 - MINISTER: Good afternoon and welcome.\\
238 - (somberly): We are here\\
239 - to celebrate the life\\
240 - and mourn the passing\\
241 - of Andrew Donald Patterson.\\
242 - How do we measure a man's life?\\
243 - Geez, this guy's a load.\\
244 - Don't get a guy like this for me.\\
245 - I want someone with a little bit ofgravitas.\\
246 - I'll see if James Earl Jones is available.\\
247 - That would be nice.\\
248 - "...a time to die,\\
249 - "a time to reap,\\
250 - "a time to sow,\\
251 - "a time to mourn...\\
252 - JAMES EARL JONES: "...a time to heal.\\
253 - a time for every purpose under heaven."\\
254 - And so we say goodbye to Charles Francis Harper.\\
255 - Devoted son,\\
256 - loving brother, caring uncle.\\
257 - Bon vivant and world-class\\
258 - connoisseur of the booty.\\
259 - Nice turnout.\\
260 - Yeah, man. Standing room only.\\
261 - Goes to show you, give the people what they want.\\
262 - You mean the open bar, right?\\
263 - Sure.\\
264 - Thanks for coming, by the way.\\
265 - Well, you came to mine.\\
266 - Yeah, but you're dead.\\
267 - Charlie, take a look in the box.\\
268 - That's not a tanning booth.\\
269 - Oh, yeah.\\
270 - So, listen, as long as you're here-- what's Heaven like?\\
271 - It's unbelievable.\\
272 - It's paradise.\\
273 - Like your house.\\
274 - Before your brother moved in.\\
275 - Oh, that was good.\\
276 - You can drink all you want and there's no hangover.\\
277 - Endless supply of women,\\
278 - each one more beautiful than the last,\\
279 - and, Charlie, get this:\\
280 - they believe everything you tell 'em.\\
281 - Everything?!\\
282 - It's Heaven, dude.\\
283 - Wow.\\
284 - Well, save me a good seat.\\
285 - I wish I could, but that's not where they sent me.\\
286 - Oh...\\
287 - Then how do you know what Heaven's like?\\
288 - They make us look at a video every day,\\
289 - while they're putting lube on the pitchfork.\\
290 - Well, at least you get lube.\\
291 - Only on the little prong.\\
292 - JAMES EARL JONES: To be completely honest,\\
293 - I didn't know Charlie Harper,\\
294 - but any man who, with his dying breath,\\
295 - would set aside $25,000 and a first-class air ticket,\\
296 - so I could deliver his eulogy...\\
297 - is aces in my book!\\
298 - That being said, uh...\\
299 - there are many people here today who did know Charlie,\\
300 - and perhaps some of them would like to stand up\\
301 - and say a few words.\\
302 - Ooh! Ooh! I want to say something.\\
303 - Uh... Hello, everybody.\\
304 - Hello, James Earl Jones.\\
305 - Um... hey, bro. Don't get up.\\
306 - What can I say about Charlie?\\
307 - Uh, so many words come to mind--\\
308 - so few that you can say in church.\\
309 - But we'll give it a shot.\\
310 - Um... Charlie was a man of love.\\
311 - Um, he loved his friends; he loved his family;\\
312 - but, most of all, he loved his penis...\\
313 - ...the only part of him that ever had an actual job.\\
314 - Well, anyway...\\
315 - this was a man so full of love\\
316 - that it practically oozed out of him,\\
317 - at which point, of course, he would see a doctor.\\
318 - But I kid the deceased whoremonger.\\
319 - (chuckling)\\
320 - Anyway...\\
321 - since he never made out a will,\\
322 - I hope you will all join me\\
323 - for a wake-slash-luau at my Malibu beach house!\\
324 - (applause)\\
325 - He got my house?!\\
326 - He got everything you had.\\
327 - Everything?!\\
328 - Well, not the diseased liver\\
329 - and the swollen prostate.\\
330 - Oh, look, your old girlfriends\\
331 - are saying their final goodbye.\\
332 - (spits)\\
333 - (spits)\\
334 - That's not very respectful.\\
335 - Just FYI-- spit is the Devil's lube.\\
336 - Listen, would you mind recording my answering machine message for me?\\
337 - That'll be an extra $500.\\
338 - That's okay. I'm rich now.\\
339 - Well, what do you want: "This is CNN"\\
340 - or "Luke, I am your father"?\\
341 - So, Charlie, it's been great catching up but I gotta go.\\
342 - Already? Can't you stay awhile?\\
343 - No. It's pitchfork time.\\
344 - If you're late, you don't get the spit.\\
345 - And, believe me, Charlie, you want the spit.\\
346 - I want the spit!\\
347 - * Men. *\\
348 - Harper. Charlie Harper.\\
349 - It was in a few days ago.\\
350 - I peed in a cup; you took my blood\\
351 - and slipped a camera up the heart of darkness.\\
352 - You know, the doctor said my results\\
353 - would be ready today.\\
354 - Fine. Have him get back to me.\\
355 - He's avoiding my calls, Alan.\\
356 - I'm gonna die.\\
357 - No. No you're not.\\
358 - I can feel it.\\
359 - You might as well just drive into that tree\\
360 - and kill us both.\\
361 - Sure.\\
362 - (monotone): I don't want to go on living without you.\\
363 - What's the point of it all?\\
364 - Yeah, I'm rich, charming, classically handsome.\\
365 - I've laid more pipe than a guy\\
366 - who has sex with pipes.\\
367 - But what have I done with my life?\\
368 - A few stupid jingles; some kids' songs--\\
369 - nothing that really matters.\\
370 - (monotone): Now, now, you're being too hard on yourself.\\
371 - I've got no wife, I've got no children...\\
372 - I'm going leave this world the way I came in...\\
373 - By Cesarean section?\\
374 - Alone.\\
375 - Oh, for God sakes, Charlie,\\
376 - I am tired of listening to this.\\
377 - There has always been one person in your life\\
378 - who's been there for you and loved you unconditionally.\\
379 - You mean...?\\
380 - You're right.\\
381 - How could I have missed it?\\
382 - It's been in front of me the whole time!\\
383 - Well, you know, sometimes you can't see\\
384 - the forest for the trees,\\
385 - even when the forest is in your own backyard.\\
386 - Or guest room.\\
387 - Rose?\\
388 - Yep, the one and only.\\
389 - I know, I know. It's been awhile.\\
390 - I was thinking, if you're not too busy,\\
391 - maybe we can get together, have a drink or something?\\
392 - Well, great!\\
393 - So, do you want to meet, or should I pick you up?\\
394 - (horn beeping)\\
395 - (mouthing)\\
396 - Okay, I'll meet you back at my place.\\
397 - Huh. Small world.\\
398 - Yeah. Teeny-tiny.\\
399 - * Men. *\\
400 - Here you go.\\
401 - Thank you, Charlie.\\
402 - You comfy?\\
403 - Oh, very.\\
404 - Good.\\
405 - (sighs)\\
406 - So, Rose...\\
407 - Charlie...\\
408 - Haven't seen you in awhile.\\
409 - Can't say the same.\\
410 - Right, uh, sure.\\
411 - Sorry about your friend.\\
412 - Yeah, yeah, it was a real wake-up call for me.\\
413 - Mm. I can imagine.\\
414 - Makes you stop and wonder what's important in your life.\\
415 - Who's important in your life.\\
416 - I've always known who's important in my life.\\
417 - You have, haven't you.\\
418 - You know how I feel about you, right?\\
419 - Tell me anyway.\\
420 - Oh, okay.\\
421 - Well, as you know, we've had our ups and downs.\\
422 - I told you that was my medication.\\
423 - I was talking about our relationship.\\
424 - Oh. Yes.\\
425 - That's had ups and downs, too.\\
426 - Continue.\\
427 - Well, uh, I'm thinking, we're not getting any younger.\\
428 - You know, there was a time\\
429 - when I did think I was getting younger\\
430 - but it turns out that that was my medication.\\
431 - Sure.\\
432 - I also thought that I was getting smaller.\\
433 - (clears throat)\\
434 - Anyway, uh, it struck me that life is... short,\\
435 - and maybe the time has come for you and I to start\\
436 - thinking about our future.\\
437 - What about it?\\
438 - (sighs heavily) Well...\\
439 - I know this is kind of sudden, but...\\
440 - Rose...\\
441 - Yes, Charlie?\\
442 - (phone rings) Would you do me the honor of...\\
443 - I'm sorry.\\
444 - Let me just get rid of this.\\
445 - Oh, it's my doctor.\\
446 - Hey, Doc.\\
447 - What's the word?\\
448 - No liver damage whatsoever?\\
449 - What about my heart?\\
450 - Well, that's terrific!\\
451 - Lungs are good, too?\\
452 - So I don't have to give up cigars?\\
453 - No, no, no, I won't overdo it.\\
454 - Just when I drink.\\
455 - Speaking of which-- how's the plumbing?\\
456 - Does that include the prostate?\\
457 - (quietly): Yes.\\
458 - All right, well, uh,\\
459 - thanks for getting back to me so soon.\\
460 - And, again, I'm sorry for all the name calling\\
461 - when you slipped your finger up there.\\
462 - Oh, boy, this is awkward.\\
463 - * Men. *\\
464 - * Men. *\\
465 - Look at him-- he's gonna live forever.\\
466 - Nah, it's just gonna seem like forever.\\
467 - He smokes, he drinks, he parties like there's no tomorrow.\\
468 - Me?\\
469 - I have Mexican food and a couple of beers\\
470 - and I'm farting blood.\\
471 - Yeah, boo-hoo.\\
472 - You just said Mexican food and I grew a third butt cheek.\\
473 - Life isn't fair, is it, Berta?\\
474 - If it were, you'd be cleaning my toilets\\
475 - and I'd have my own talk show.\\
476 - A talk show?!\\
477 - Why not? I'm personable.\\
478 - Well, at least he has a clean bill of health.\\
479 - I'm happy for that.\\
480 - Me, too.\\
481 - I don't care if I never inherit this house.\\
482 - Uh, uh... excuse me?\\
483 - Oh, you ain't seen his new will, huh?\\
484 - Uh, what new will?\\
485 - Never mind.\\
486 - But in case tragedy strikes,\\
487 - be prepared to clear your crap out of here in 48 hours.\\
488 - Son of a bitch.
\subsection {Episode 12: Thank God for Scoliosis}
1 - Oh, thank you, Dr. Harper.\\
2 - And remember, no more rough sex.\\
3 - (chuckles)\\
4 - Oh, Dr. Harper, you're terrible.\\

22 - I'm making you blush.\\
23 - Well, I'm blushing.\\
24 - (laughs)\\
25 - So we all done for the day?\\
26 - Yeppers.\\
27 - Mrs. Freemantle was our last patient.\\
28 - Okay, then, uh, I will see your smiling face tomorrow.\\
29 - (chuckles)\\
30 - Well, it's only smiling 'cause it's looking at you.\\
31 - (laughs)\\
32 - Don't make me blush.\\
33 - Well, I'm making you blush.\\
34 - Well, I'm blushing.\\
35 - (both laughing)\\
36 - I'm so sorry.\\
37 - I should apologize.\\
38 - No, I'm the one who stepped over the line.\\
39 - No, no, I stepped, too.\\
40 - No, no, I stepped first. No, no, no.\\
41 - Don't give me "no, no."\\
42 - I'm giving you "no, no."\\
43 - We can't do this.\\
44 - I'm sorry, I can't help it.\\
45 - I ache for you.\\
46 - Yeah, well, I'm not all that\\
47 - comfortable right now either.\\
48 - It-it-it's just that I feel like...\\
49 - You don't have to explain.\\
50 - I understand.\\
51 - Okay. Okay.\\
52 - Well, then, uh, I guess I will see you tomorrow.\\
53 - I'll be here at, uh, 7:30.\\
54 - In case you want to get in early.\\
55 - Oh, okay.\\
56 - Uh, I-I might actually want to...\\
57 - get in early.\\
58 - You're the boss.\\
59 - You can get in anytime you want.\\
60 - Oh, God.\\
61 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
62 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
63 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
64 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh... *\\

67 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
68 - * Men.\\
69 - Hey.\\
70 - Hey.\\
71 - Mind if I watch the game?\\
72 - Uh, actually, I came in here for a little quiet time.\\
73 - Huh.\\
74 - (TV clicks on, sports playing)\\
75 - Still quieter than sleeping under the Santa Monica Pier.\\
76 - I'm conflicted, Charlie.\\
77 - Shh, quiet time.\\
78 - ANNOUNCER (over TV): Nice throw, nice catch.\\
79 - Reggie Williams, he scores...\\
80 - Do you think you can choose who you love?\\
81 - Oh, boy.\\
82 - (TV clicks off)\\
83 - What's his name?\\
84 - What? No!\\
85 - Oh, all right.\\
86 - Come out when you're ready.\\
87 - (TV clicks on, sports playing)\\
88 - Williams will come far right...\\
89 - (TV clicks off)\\
90 - Do you remember my receptionist?\\
91 - The itsy bitsy spider who climbed up my water spout?\\
92 - Yeah. Whatever happened to her?\\
93 - You dumped her after one depraved weekend,\\
94 - and I had to give her a raise, health insurance\\
95 - and a paid vacation to keep her from quitting.\\
96 - Oh, good.\\
97 - Thanks for smoothing that over for me.\\
98 - Hey, you think she has plans for this weekend?\\
99 - What is wrong with you?!\\
100 - Uh, I am trying to tell you\\
101 - that I'm starting to have feelings for her.\\
102 - For who?\\
103 - For Melissa.\\
104 - Who's Melissa?\\
105 - My receptionist!\\
106 - Oh.\\
107 - So I should forget about this weekend?\\
108 - Yes, you should forget about this weekend!\\
109 - I was just asking.\\
110 - You don't have to bite my head off.\\
111 - So you and her are, uh...\\
112 - Oh, no, no, no, nothing's happened yet.\\
113 - Just a little kissing, and she could feel my... enthusiasm.\\
114 - What, are you Noel Coward?\\
115 - Just say "boner."\\
116 - Why do I bother talking to you?\\
117 - Beats the hell out of me.\\
118 - The thing is, Melissa and I have-have this chemistry,\\
119 - and it's really hard not to act on it.\\
120 - Yeah, it's tough when you work together.\\
121 - Right.\\
122 - You don't crap where you eat.\\
123 - I know.\\
124 - You don't dip your pen in company ink.\\
125 - And you never bang a woman who owns a snake or a bird.\\
126 - What?\\
127 - They're usually nuts.\\
128 - So what you're faced with here is a moral dilemma.\\
129 - Oh, I'll say.\\
130 - Whether or not to have an intimate relationship\\
131 - with a woman who is also your employee.\\
132 - Exactly.\\
133 - I got it, I got it.\\
134 - Oh, you do?\\
135 - Fire her, then boink her.\\
136 - I don't got it?\\
137 - You don't got it.\\
138 - (TV clicks on, sports playing)\\
139 - Open in the corner is Mike Williams.\\
140 - ANNOUNCER #2: Well, this is what you were...\\
141 - I'm right about the snakes and birds though.\\
142 - * Men.\\
143 - Really?\\
144 - The one who works for him?\\
145 - Yep.\\
146 - Tinkerbell with the knockers?\\
147 - The same.\\
148 - Well, everybody makes that mistake once.\\
149 - I crossed that line in the '70s\\
150 - when I was cleaning house for Mr. Telly Savalas.\\
151 - No kidding.\\
152 - TV's Kojak?\\
153 - One and the same.\\
154 - What happened?\\
155 - What do you think happened?\\
156 - He's Greek, a man of passion.\\
157 - You can't tie your shoes around those guys.\\
158 - That's rough.\\
159 - Bet your ass it's rough.\\
160 - Morning.\\
161 - Morning.\\
162 - So, Zippy,\\
163 - I hear you've been sinking your putts\\
164 - on the company golf course.\\
165 - Thanks for telling her.\\
166 - Thanks for telling me.\\
167 - Word of advice:\\
168 - it may seem like fun and games at the beginning,\\
169 - but mark my words, sooner or later, you're gonna wake up\\
170 - with a broken heart and a lollipop stuck to your keister.\\
171 - You want to explain that to me?\\
172 - I'd rather forget I ever heard it.\\
173 - So, decide what you're gonna do about Melissa?\\
174 - There's nothing to do.\\
175 - I have to take the physical feelings I have for her\\
176 - and channel them into something creative, productive,\\
177 - something, something that'll last.\\
178 - You're gonna have sex with the vacuum cleaner again,\\
179 - aren't you?\\
180 - That wasn't sex, that was an accident.\\
181 - Once is an accident.\\
182 - * Men.\\
183 - Morning, Melissa.\\
184 - Good morning, Dr. Harper.\\
185 - How's my schedule look today?\\
186 - It's packed pretty tight.\\
187 - Oh, okay.\\
188 - Uh, tight's good.\\
189 - You know, better-better tight than,\\
190 - uh, you know...\\
191 - Thank God for scoliosis.\\
192 - (chuckles)\\
193 - Um, listen, Melissa,\\
194 - um, about what happened yesterday...\\
195 - Please, Dr. Harper, you don't have to say anything.\\
196 - Yes, yes, I do.\\
197 - We obviously have feelings for each other, and...\\
198 - ...there's nothing wrong with that.\\
199 - It's-it's a beautiful thing. It's-it's natural.\\
200 - But for us to maintain a-a working relationship,\\
201 - and I hope friendship,\\
202 - I-I think\\
203 - it would be unwise to succumb to those feelings.\\
204 - I agree.\\
205 - Oh, good, good.\\
206 - I'm glad. (chuckles)\\
207 - Oh, well, now we got that out of the way...\\
208 - (both chuckle)\\
209 - Uh, what time does my packed schedule begin?\\
210 - Uh, not for a half hour.\\
211 - Half hour?\\
212 - Yeppers.\\
213 - Nothing for a half hour?\\
214 - Wide open.\\
215 - * Men.\\
216 - Everything work out at the office?\\
217 - Uh-huh.\\
218 - Manage to keep your hands off Really Little Annie Fanny?\\
219 - Well, not exactly, but, uh, we did keep it above the waist.\\
220 - Her waist or yours?\\
221 - Both.\\
222 - And it wasn't easy.\\
223 - I haven't checked, but I'm pretty sure\\
224 - my balls look like two-thirds of the Blue Man Group.\\
225 - Berta, hide the vacuum cleaner!\\
226 - For the last time, I use it to get lint off my trousers.\\
227 - Then why do you call it Brenda?\\
228 - * Men.\\
229 - ANNOUNCER: So when the mood strikes and she's ready,\\
230 - you'll be ready, too.\\
231 - Ready today, ready tonight, ready tomorrow.\\
232 - I'm ready now.\\
233 - What's he ready for?\\
234 - If I were to guess, I'd say he's ready\\
235 - to screw up his life a little more.\\
236 - Is that even possible?\\
237 - We'll see.\\
238 - I'm hungry.\\
239 - So eat something.\\
240 - There's nothing here I like.\\
241 - Welcome to my world.\\
242 - * Men.\\
243 - Why are we eating here?\\
244 - If I have to watch you stuff your face,\\
245 - I'm gonna need a drink.\\
246 - Am I even allowed to be in a bar?\\
247 - Probably not.\\
248 - So if anybody asks, you're a homely lesbian.\\
249 - Why do I have to be homely?\\
250 - Just sit down.\\
251 - What's that smell?\\
252 - Stale beer, vomit, urine.\\
253 - You hungry?\\
254 - Hey, Charlie.\\
255 - Hi, Janine. This is my nephew Jake.\\
256 - Hey, Jake.\\
257 - How old are you, sweetheart?\\
258 - Keep your hands off him, Janine, he's married.\\
259 - I thought I was a lesbian.\\
260 - We're just gonna have a couple of hamburgers\\
261 - and a basket of fries, he'll have a soda\\
262 - and I'll have a draft.\\
263 - That's not a very healthy dinner for a growing boy.\\
264 - Well, don't worry, he can process anything.\\
265 - The other day, he ate a handful of packing peanuts.\\
266 - You bet me ten bucks I wouldn't.\\
267 - Oh, Charlie, shame on you.\\
268 - Yeah, shame on you.\\
269 - Tell you what, Jake,\\
270 - I get out of here in ten minutes.\\
271 - Why don't you get your uncle to bring you over to my place,\\
272 - and I'll cook you a nice, healthy dinner?\\
273 - Thanks, but I'm already healthy. I'll have a hamburger.\\
274 - All right.\\
275 - No, you won't. We'll be there.\\
276 - I don't get a vote?\\
277 - You're lucky you're getting dinner.\\
278 - Thanks, Janine.\\
279 - You're welcome.\\
280 - What is wrong with you, turning that down?\\
281 - Excuse me, but we have no idea what kind of cook she is.\\
282 - Oh, God...\\
283 - For all we know, she's a vegetarian.\\
284 - (groans)\\
285 - * Men.\\
286 - Dr. Harper, what are you doing here?\\
287 - What do you think I'm doing here?\\
288 - Please don't make me guess.\\
289 - I'm making you guess.\\
290 - Correct.\\
291 - WOMAN: Melissa, honey, who's here?\\
292 - Uh, Mom, this is my boss, Dr. Harper.\\
293 - Dr. Harper, this is my mother.\\
294 - Hello.\\
295 - Hello yourself.\\
296 - I understand there's been\\
297 - some inappropriate behavior in the workplace.\\
298 - Yeah, well, about that,\\
299 - I-I-I just want you to know that I have nothing but respect\\
300 - for your daughter, and I would never do anything...\\
301 - I'm just yankin' your chain!\\
302 - Ain't nothin' wrong with beddin' the boss.\\
303 - That's how I wound up with the little princess here\\
304 - and half a Black Angus franchise.\\
305 - Come on in. I'm watchin' Hellboy.\\
306 - Okay. Thanks.\\
307 - You smoke dope?\\
308 - * Men.\\
309 - This is, like, the best dinner ever.\\
310 - I'm glad you liked it, Jake.\\
311 - You are a great cook.\\
312 - And you are a cutie pie.\\
313 - Oh! I could just eat you up.\\
314 - Want another root beer?\\
315 - Sure.\\
316 - Comin' right up.\\
317 - Listen, buddy, you're gonna have to make yourself scarce.\\
318 - Maybe take a cab home.\\
319 - You take a cab home. I'm doin' great.\\
320 - How do you figure?\\
321 - You blind? First base on the top of my head,\\
322 - second base in my ear?\\
323 - Listen to me, knucklehead.\\
324 - That woman's got to be ten years older than you.\\
325 - So? You're, like, 15 years older than her.\\
326 - Step aside, grandpa.\\
327 - Okay, fun time's over.\\
328 - Go wait in the car.\\
329 - You go wait in the car.\\
330 - No, you go.\\
331 - No, you go.\\
332 - Jake, how about I put some ice cream\\
333 - in that root beer and make it a float?\\
334 - Thank you. That'd be great.\\
335 - It's like she can read my mind.\\
336 - Go get in the car.\\
337 - Fine, I'll just go tell Janine\\
338 - that you want me to wait in the car by myself\\
339 - so you can try and have sex with her.\\
340 - Sit down, you little bastard.\\
341 - Now, this picture here is toward the end of my labor.\\
342 - That's my vagina,\\
343 - and that's Melissa's little head\\
344 - pokin' out of me like a groundhog.\\
345 - Mmm.\\
346 - Hey, I guess if she'd seen her shadow,\\
347 - I would've had six more weeks of labor, huh?\\
348 - (laughs)\\
349 - It's funny.\\
350 - You know, of all my kids, she was the easiest.\\
351 - Just like popping out a ping-pong ball. Phht!\\
352 - That's quite an image.\\
353 - Yeah, oh, and it was a natural childbirth, too.\\
354 - No drugs, just a couple of peyote buttons\\
355 - and bitin' down on a rope.\\
356 - (clears throat)\\
357 - Mom, would you mind\\
358 - if Dr. Harper and I have a little time alone?\\
359 - I'm sorry, honey.\\
360 - You kids must be as horny as a couple of drunken rabbits.\\
361 - Enjoy.\\
362 - Oh, uh,\\
363 - Kama Sutra's on the bookshelf\\
364 - case you feel like pushin' the envelope.\\
365 - I'm sorry about that.\\
366 - Mom never really made it home from Woodstock.\\
367 - Don't be silly. She's delightful.\\
368 - I'm just gonna close this up now.\\
369 - Don't mind me.\\
370 - I'm just gonna a roll a fatty in the backyard\\
371 - and zone out in the hammock.\\
372 - (slurping)\\
373 - Ah, that hit the spot.\\
374 - I'm glad you liked it.\\
375 - The best part of a root beer float?\\
376 - Your burps taste good.\\
377 - Listen, Janine, thanks for everything,\\
378 - but I should probably get this little guy home\\
379 - and come back.\\
380 - It's way past his bedtime.\\
381 - What are you talking about? It's not past my bedtime.\\
382 - What do you wanna bet he falls asleep in the car\\
383 - and I have to carry him in?\\
384 - What do you wanna bet he has to go home and take a laxative\\
385 - because he's too old to poop normal?\\
386 - All right, that's it!\\
387 - Not in the face! Not in the face!\\
388 - What?\\
389 - Stop that!\\
390 - He's kidding. I never hit him.\\
391 - Jake, tell her you're kidding.\\
392 - I'm kidding about that, but he can be verbally abusive.\\
393 - Not funny, Jake.\\
394 - The liquor makes him mean.\\
395 - Okay, I didn't want to have to do this,\\
396 - but I am calling your father, let him deal with you.\\
397 - I'm gonna go straighten up in the kitchen.\\
398 - (quietly) You don't know who you're messing with.\\
399 - (loudly): Are you kidding? I think she's gorgeous!\\
400 - Ow! Ow!\\
401 - You don't know who you're messin' with.\\
402 - (ring tone plays): * Up, up and away in my beautiful... *\\
403 - I'm sorry about that. Hang on.\\
404 - Charlie, now is not a good time.\\
405 - All right, put him on.\\
406 - I can't talk now, Dad.\\
407 - I'm about to get lucky with an older woman.\\
408 - What?!\\
409 - Where are you?\\
410 - Jake? Jake?!\\
411 - Alan, would you be totally weirded out\\
412 - by a little mother-daughter tag team?\\
413 - * Men.\\
414 - * Men.\\
415 - I hope you're happy.\\
416 - I hope you're happy.\\
417 - I could've been happy.\\
418 - Are you gonna tell me what happened tonight?\\
419 - You don't wanna know.\\
420 - Where are you going?\\
421 - I'm a 14-year-old boy who recently got ear-boob.\\
422 - Where do you think I'm going?\\
423 - Ear-boob?\\
424 - You don't wanna know.\\
425 - So how'd it go with Melissa?\\
426 - You don't wanna know.\\
427 - Oh, come on.\\
428 - All right. I met her mom, saw a photo of mom's vagina,\\
429 - and chose to leave before being introduced to the real thing.\\
430 - You're right, I didn't wanna know.\\
431 - Where are you going?\\
432 - I'm a 40-year-old guy who recently...\\
433 - Ah, screw it. I'm gonna go play with myself.\\
434 - Okay, that I didn't want to know.\\
435 - Still not a bad idea.
\subsection {Episode 13: I Think You Offended Don}
1 - * Men. *\\
2 - Let's see, sperm meets egg here.\\
3 - 30 days has September,\\
4 - all the rest have 31,\\
5 - except for Judith, who has 28.\\
6 - CHARLIE: Hey, Alan.\\
7 - Meet Don.\\
8 - Hello, Don.\\
9 - Hello, Alan.\\
10 - Don drove me home\\
11 - and I don't have any money.\\
12 - Okay, uh, is Don a cabbie?\\
13 - No, no.\\
14 - Don is a close, personal friend.\\
15 - Don is a cabbie.\\
16 - He has enough friends, and he wants his $80.\\
17 - What happened to your money?\\
18 - Good question.\\
19 - You know how easy Texas Hold 'Em looks on TV\\
20 - when you can see the other guys' hole cards?\\
21 - Yeah.\\
22 - Very different in real life.\\
23 - Uh, 20, 40, 60,\\
24 - 80.\\
25 - No tip?\\
26 - Hold on.\\
27 - Let's see, five dollars...\\
28 - Keep your money, Mr. Trump.\\
29 - You need it more than I do.\\
30 - Are we still on for lunch?\\
31 - (Don speaking Hindi)\\
32 - I think you offended Don.\\
33 - He'll get over it.\\
34 - Where's your car?\\
35 - Don't change the subject.\\
36 - (slurring): You owe Don an apology.\\
37 - Oh, hey, a calendar.\\
38 - Yeah.\\
39 - What's "JMC" stand for?\\
40 - Nothing.\\
41 - Oh, come on.\\
42 - John Mellencamp Cougar?\\
43 - No.\\
44 - Jumping Methodist...\\
45 - (slurring): cougar?\\
46 - No.\\
47 - Then I give up.\\
48 - Well, if you must know,\\
49 - it stands for "Judith's menstrual cycle."\\
50 - Get out.\\
51 - No, look.\\
52 - This is when Judith and Herb broke up.\\
53 - And this is the day that I had sex with her.\\
54 - Dude...\\
55 - you need a better hobby.\\
56 - Judith is now five months pregnant.\\
57 - Oh, yeah, right.\\
58 - She's probably in that sweet spot\\
59 - where her boobs are big and cushy\\
60 - but her ass is still normal.\\
61 - Charlie, it is almost certain\\
62 - that I am the father of Judith's baby.\\
63 - Are you still grinding on this?\\
64 - What if it's a girl?\\
65 - I always wanted a daughter.\\
66 - I finally get one and some other guy gets to be her dad.\\
67 - I feel like the universe\\
68 - is playing some horrible practical joke on me.\\
69 - Wow.\\
70 - I lost $8,000 playing poker.\\
71 - I have no idea where my car is,\\
72 - threw up in my mouth three times,\\
73 - and I'm still having a better night than you are.\\
74 - I don't expect you to understand.\\
75 - You don't know the joy of being a parent.\\
76 - Of watching a part of you grow and develop,\\
77 - blooming into a fully formed human being.\\
78 - (gagging, coughing)\\
79 - Four times.\\
80 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
81 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
82 - * Men. *\\
83 - Hi. Hi.\\
84 - Jake, your father's here.\\
85 - So, how you doing?\\
86 - Good.\\
87 - Over the morning sickness?\\
88 - Yes, Alan.\\
89 - Uh, by my calculations\\
90 - probably about a week, ten days ago?\\
91 - That sounds right.\\
92 - Good, good.\\
93 - You have a nice break till the, uh, till\\
94 - the old hemorrhoids come a-callin'.\\
95 - Jake!\\
96 - Judith, are we gonna talk about the elephant in the room?\\
97 - What elephant?\\
98 - Come on, you, me, the baby?\\
99 - I mean, we did have unprotected sex...\\
100 - You shut your mouth. We did not.\\
101 - Yes, we did. Read my lips.\\
102 - We did not have sex.\\
103 - Oh, hey, Alan. How goes it?\\
104 - Oh, uh, fine, Herb.\\
105 - Uh, how you doing?\\
106 - Proud as a peacock.\\
107 - Honey, did you show him the sonogram?\\
108 - No.\\
109 - Oh, you should see her, Alan.\\
110 - Her? So, it is a girl?\\
111 - Yep, one fresh-faced little fetus\\
112 - sans wee-wee.\\
113 - I always wanted a sans wee-wee.\\
114 - Well, you can't have mine.\\
115 - (laughing): No, no, of course not.\\
116 - Hey, wanna see how we're decorating the nursery?\\
117 - He doesn't wanna see the nursery, Herb.\\
118 - Sure I would. You going with mermaids?\\
119 - Little girls love mermaids.\\
120 - Actually, I was thinking little ponies.\\
121 - Little ponies? Yeah, why?\\
122 - Oh, gosh...\\
123 - Little ponies have little penises.\\
124 - Really? I didn't notice that on the stencils.\\
125 - Let's go take a look.\\
126 - I'm ready.\\
127 - Oh, uh, I'll be right back.\\
128 - I'm just going to go see the baby's room.\\
129 - He never wants to see my room.\\
130 - That's because your room is a pig sty.\\
131 - I didn't ask for a reason.\\
132 - * Men.\\
133 - Alan, buddy,\\
134 - I'm getting a little concerned about your drinking.\\
135 - I don't have a problem.\\
136 - Well, I do.\\
137 - You're swillin' my good stuff.\\
138 - Here.\\
139 - Have some Old Wal-Mart.\\
140 - Thank you.\\
141 - What's this?\\
142 - Ugh, a diary I kept during Judith's pregnancy.\\
143 - Jennifer, Jocelyn,\\
144 - Jasmine, Jolene?\\
145 - Some of the names that we picked out\\
146 - in case Jake had been a girl.\\
147 - Oh, man, can you imagine him as a chick?\\
148 - Woof!\\
149 - Yeah, well, that's not how it turned out.\\
150 - Think about it though.\\
151 - Every weekend, me, you\\
152 - and a big ugly girl with a bad haircut.\\
153 - I'm gonna have a daughter, Charlie.\\
154 - Okay, okay, first of all,\\
155 - you don't know it's your kid.\\
156 - All we know is that when Judith and Herb broke up\\
157 - you nailed Judith.\\
158 - Then when they reconciled, Herb nailed Judith.\\
159 - So, the only thing we know for sure\\
160 - is that despite all outward appearances,\\
161 - Judith is a slut.\\
162 - Hey, I'm aware that technically\\
163 - either one of us could be the father,\\
164 - but I know in my gut\\
165 - that this is my sweet bastard child.\\
166 - You don't know squat.\\
167 - And you wanna talk technically?\\
168 - Technically,\\
169 - maybe neither one of you is the father.\\
170 - Oh, dear God, Charlie.\\
171 - What have you done?\\
172 - Not me, you fool.\\
173 - Although if I had known she was that easy, may...\\
174 - Stop!\\
175 - All I'm saying is there could very well be\\
176 - some guy in her driveway with a leaf blower\\
177 - pining away for "baby Juanita."\\
178 - That's just ridiculous.\\
179 - Judith won't even eat Mexican food.\\
180 - Look, even if you're right,\\
181 - doing anything about it,\\
182 - it's just gonna destroy a marriage.\\
183 - I know, I know.\\
184 - It's just... it's so hard to ignore my paternal instincts.\\
185 - Sure, I see those instincts with Jake\\
186 - and I admire them.\\
187 - If I was his dad,\\
188 - I would've dropped him off at an orphanage\\
189 - with 20 bucks and a bag of doughnuts.\\
190 - No, you wouldn't.\\
191 - He was adorable when he was a baby.\\
192 - Baby?\\
193 - I'm talking about last week.\\
194 - I walked into his room.\\
195 - He was trying to bite his toenails.\\
196 - Let's be honest.\\
197 - That's monkey behavior.\\
198 - My son is not a monkey.\\
199 - My point here is, forget the baby.\\
200 - You've already got a kid to raise.\\
201 - Yeah, I guess.\\
202 - Hey.\\
203 - He's not a monkey.\\
204 - * Men. *\\
205 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?\\
206 - I don't wanna watch football.\\
207 - Nobody cares what you wanna watch.\\
208 - Why do you get to decide everything around here?\\
209 - Oh, I don't know.\\
210 - Maybe it's because I bought everything around here.\\
211 - Oh, right, play the money card.\\
212 - That's all you got.\\
213 - That's all I need.\\
214 - Now shut up.\\
215 - (softly): No, you shut up.\\
216 - All right, I'm gonna count to three\\
217 - and then I'm gonna kick your ass.\\
218 - Ooh, I'm scared.\\
219 - One.\\
220 - Two. I'm only leaving 'cause I'm bored.\\
221 - He keeps growing, I'm screwed.\\
222 - Hey, hey, uh,\\
223 - you wanna hear what I wrote the night you were born?\\
224 - Not really.\\
225 - Oh, come on. Come on.\\
226 - Uh, sit down. You'll like it.\\
227 - It's kind of a poem.\\
228 - Um...\\
229 - "My son, my son, my only one.\\
230 - "You open my heart like the morning sun.\\
231 - "Your tiny face, your tiny hand.\\
232 - "Never have I felt a love so grand."\\
233 - Gay.\\
234 - What do you know about poetry, you monkey?\\
235 - * Men. *\\
236 - Oh, hey, Herb.\\
237 - Just thought I'd stop by and see\\
238 - if you needed any help with the baby's room.\\
239 - Thanks, I'm painting today.\\
240 - Oh, great.\\
241 - Just call me Vincent Van "Gogh-ing" to help you.\\
242 - Funnier in my head. Let's go.\\
243 - Oh, Judith, look who stopped by\\
244 - to help paint the baby's room.\\
245 - Surprise.\\
246 - Herb doesn't need any help, Alan.\\
247 - Yes, I do. Yes, he does.\\
248 - HERB: Come on, I'm just\\
249 - finishing up the base coat,\\
250 - but I'm gonna start on the unicorn stencils. Unicorns?\\
251 - Oh, Herb, that's just a pony with a strap-on!\\
252 - * Men. *\\
253 - * Men. *\\
254 - I know, tell me about it.\\
255 - It's like nine kinds of "suck" in an eight-suck bag.\\
256 - Hey, Jake?\\
257 - Gotta go.\\
258 - I didn't mean to interrupt your call.\\
259 - Yeah, well, you should've thought of that\\
260 - before you barged in.\\
261 - Yeah.\\
262 - The reason I barged in\\
263 - was to apologize for threatening to kick your ass.\\
264 - I wouldn't really do that.\\
265 - You couldn't really do that.\\
266 - Anyway,\\
267 - I was thinking about ordering a pizza.\\
268 - You interested? No, thanks.\\
269 - Maybe you didn't hear me.\\
270 - Pizza.\\
271 - Dough, sauce, cheese, grease, meat.\\
272 - I've seen you lick the box.\\
273 - I'm not hungry.\\
274 - Okay, what the hell's wrong with you?\\
275 - Nothing. Fine.\\
276 - Be that way.\\
277 - I know what's going on here.\\
278 - You're bent out of shape 'cause your mom's having another baby.\\
279 - No, I'm not.\\
280 - It's okay.\\
281 - Nothing to be ashamed of.\\
282 - In fact, I know exactly how you feel.\\
283 - My mom's second child ruined my life.\\
284 - That's my dad.\\
285 - Uh-huh.\\
286 - Listen, it wasn't all bad.\\
287 - When babies grow up a little, you can have fun with 'em.\\
288 - You know, pee in their canteen,\\
289 - teach 'em to stutter.\\
290 - Of course, the down side is they're so damaged\\
291 - later on they move into your guest room\\
292 - with their kid and never leave.\\
293 - Not that I don't love having you here.\\
294 - You're a delight.\\
295 - I'm fine with the baby.\\
296 - Really?\\
297 - Yeah. I'm actually kinda looking forward to it.\\
298 - Well, that's a novel approach.\\
299 - So if it's not the baby,\\
300 - why have you been such a dillweed lately?\\
301 - None of your business.\\
302 - So it's a girl.\\
303 - Just get out of my room.\\
304 - Make me.\\
305 - God, you're such a child.\\
306 - Oh, yeah, it's a girl.\\
307 - Hmm, Jolene.\\
308 - Yeah.\\
309 - Jolene Melnick.\\
310 - Nope, I don't think so.\\
311 - Why not? You could call her Jo or Josie.\\
312 - Kinda wanted to name her after my Grandma Mildred.\\
313 - Mildred Melnick?\\
314 - Yeah. We could call her Mil, or Millie.\\
315 - I'm sorry, Herb.\\
316 - But with a name like Mildred\\
317 - you might as well call her Staff Sergeant Melnick.\\
318 - Herb, can you get the cookies for me?\\
319 - Oh, sure.\\
320 - We, uh, keep 'em on the top shelf of the pantry.\\
321 - You know... Jake.\\
322 - Yeah.\\
323 - Charlie keeps his fudge nuggets in the trunk of his car.\\
324 - Thank you, dear.\\
325 - What are you doing here?\\
326 - I'm helping my friend, helping you.\\
327 - If not for me, our little girl would be surrounded\\
328 - by metaphorical pony peni.\\
329 - Our little girl?!\\
330 - Alan, I don't know what you imagine happened\\
331 - between you and me, but if you say anything to Herb,\\
332 - I swear to God I'll put a gun in your mouth\\
333 - and paint these walls with your brains.\\
334 - I think we settled on mermaids.\\
335 - Cookie for my cookie?\\
336 - Oh, yum. Thank you.\\
337 - Wow.\\
338 - Pregnancy's a wild ride, huh?\\
339 - One minute she's loving and affectionate,\\
340 - the next minute she's, well...\\
341 - Cruel, vengeful, castrating?\\
342 - I was going to say moody.\\
343 - Wait for it.\\
344 - Of course I want to go to the party.\\
345 - 'Cause\\
346 - my stupid uncle won't let me.\\
347 - I don't know,\\
348 - 'cause he's old and clueless.\\
349 - No, I can't sneak out.\\
350 - 'Cause I gotta be here to change his adult diapers.\\
351 - Otherwise he just sits in his own filth.\\
352 - I know,\\
353 - it's really gross.\\
354 - Hi there.\\
355 - Gotta go.\\
356 - You're not supposed to listen to my private conversations.\\
357 - You're not supposed to tell people I crap my pants.\\
358 - Okay, whatever.\\
359 - So what's the deal with this party\\
360 - that I'm supposedly not letting you go to,\\
361 - like I actually give a rat's ass about your social life?\\
362 - Just leave me alone.\\
363 - You know that's not going to happen.\\
364 - Come on. You can trust me.\\
365 - Did you trust me when I told you that?\\
366 - Um... I'm confused.\\
367 - Of course you are.\\
368 - Now tell me why you don't want to go to this party.\\
369 - I can't tell you.\\
370 - It's embarrassing.\\
371 - Okay, okay.\\
372 - How about I tell you something embarrassing\\
373 - about myself first?\\
374 - Like what?\\
375 - Well, let's see.\\
376 - All right,\\
377 - about 15 years ago, I was in Bangkok.\\
378 - (giggles)\\
379 - What?\\
380 - Bangkok.\\
381 - It's a real place, you nimrod.\\
382 - Still funny though.\\
383 - Anyway, I was in this bar\\
384 - and I met this beautiful woman,\\
385 - and I was a little drunk\\
386 - and I didn't notice the Adam's apple.\\
387 - But later that night....\\
388 - Well, believe me, I was really embarrassed.\\
389 - Girls don't have Adam's apples.\\
390 - Oh, dude, you are such a 'mo.\\
391 - No, no, no, no, we just kissed.\\
392 - Oh, that's even worse!\\
393 - All right.\\
394 - I shared. Now you share.\\
395 - You didn't have to share that.\\
396 - A fart in the lunch line would've made your point.\\
397 - I get it.\\
398 - I'm sorry. Now talk.\\
399 - Okay.\\
400 - Well, there's this girl I kinda like\\
401 - and she's gonna be at the party tonight.\\
402 - Uh-huh.\\
403 - And she... said she wants to hook up with me.\\
404 - And you're nervous.\\
405 - Well, she's gone out with a ninth grader\\
406 - and I think she's done stuff.\\
407 - Okay, I get it.\\
408 - You've got yourself an experienced older woman\\
409 - who knows more than you.\\
410 - Everybody knows more than me.\\
411 - You should hear some of the things my friends have done.\\
412 - Oh, please.\\
413 - How old are your friends?\\
414 - Same age as me.\\
415 - How old are you?\\
416 - Fourteen.\\
417 - Mmm, horrible age.\\
418 - All right,\\
419 - first of all,\\
420 - whenever 14-year-old boys talk about sex, they're lying.\\
421 - But for a guy like you,\\
422 - the truth can be a powerful tool.\\
423 - (chuckles)\\
424 - What?\\
425 - Powerful tool.\\
426 - (sighs)\\
427 - Stay with me, Jake.\\
428 - How about a powerful tool in Bangkok?\\
429 - Jake, what I'm trying to tell you here\\
430 - is that the truth can work for you.\\
431 - What truth? That I don't know what I'm doing?\\
432 - Yep, play to your strengths,\\
433 - which in your case is ignorance.\\
434 - Here, I'll show you.\\
435 - (clears throat)\\
436 - You gently cup her face in your hands,\\
437 - look her in the eye and tell her,\\
438 - "I'm new at this\\
439 - and I'm trusting you to be patient with me."\\
440 - You're kidding.\\
441 - Nope.\\
442 - Girls eat that crap up.\\
443 - And I'll tell you something else--\\
444 - that line will work for you all the way through college.\\
445 - Or in your case, your second hitch in the Navy.\\
446 - Now go get dressed\\
447 - and I'll take you to that party.\\
448 - Thanks, Uncle Charlie.\\
449 - No problem, buddy.\\
450 - Still didn't need to hear that Bangkok story.\\
451 - I'm sorry.\\
452 - It's going to give me nightmares.\\
453 - Welcome to the club.\\
454 - All right, we're agreed on a Montessori preschool.\\
455 - But what about child care?\\
456 - Oh, well, uh, Judith's mother has already told us\\
457 - we can count on her for baby-sitting.\\
458 - Ooh.\\
459 - What?\\
460 - Oh, nothing, nothing.\\
461 - Lenore's a lovely woman.\\
462 - I'm, I'm sure the baby will be fine.\\
463 - Oh, okay, good.\\
464 - Yeah.\\
465 - She's probably got a lid on those demons by now.\\
466 - What demons?\\
467 - Oh, ah, well, it's no biggie.\\
468 - Um, she just, uh, hit a little rough patch\\
469 - with the prescription pills...\\
470 - ...the intervention, the, the rehab.\\
471 - There was an intervention?\\
472 - And rehab.\\
473 - Um, three times.\\
474 - Three times?\\
475 - Well, so far. Um....\\
476 - Oh, dear God, what the hell happened?\\
477 - (sighs)\\
478 - Golly, I-I didn't want to be the one to tell you.\\
479 - Alan, please.\\
480 - (sighs)\\
481 - All right, um,\\
482 - Lenore was baby-sitting one night,\\
483 - and when Judith and I came home,\\
484 - we found her face down in a bowl of H agen-Dazs\\
485 - with a couple of Percocets in her hair.\\
486 - You're kidding.\\
487 - Well, that's not the scary part.\\
488 - Um, we heard some shrieking\\
489 - and, uh, found baby Jake with his head stuck\\
490 - in a doggie door trying to fend off a raccoon.\\
491 - A raccoon?!\\
492 - Yeah. Yeah.\\
493 - We-we got him all the shots just to be safe,\\
494 - but he was never the same after that.\\
495 - Judith never told me about this.\\
496 - Well, it's her mother, Herb.\\
497 - What's she gonna say?\\
498 - But tell you what,\\
499 - sneak up on Jake one night wearing a Davy Crockett hat\\
500 - and see what happens.\\
501 - Anyway,\\
502 - if you ever need a-a sitter for little Jolene,\\
503 - you, uh, you call Uncle Alan.\\
504 - How's it going in here?\\
505 - Oh, honey, good news.\\
506 - Alan's offered to baby-sit\\
507 - so we don't have to risk calling your mother.\\
508 - JUDITH: Get out!\\
509 - A raccoon?!\\
510 - And you believed him?!\\
511 - Are you insane?!\\
512 - * Men. *\\
513 - How do I look?\\
514 - She already likes you, right?\\
515 - Yeah.\\
516 - Then you look great.\\
517 - Let's go.\\
518 - Hello?\\
519 - Oh.\\
520 - I'm still not real sure about this.\\
521 - What's the big deal?\\
522 - I told you how to handle it.\\
523 - I know.\\
524 - I just...\\
525 - I just don't want to go.\\
526 - All right...\\
527 - All right.\\
528 - No hurry.\\
529 - It's not like they're going to stop makin' girls.\\
530 - Hey...\\
531 - how about we order that pizza and watch a movie?\\
532 - Cool.\\
533 - I should probably change back into my eating shirt.\\
534 - Don't worry.\\
535 - You can't ruin this shirt.\\
536 - (sniffing)\\
537 - What the hell is that cologne?\\
538 - Air freshener from the toilet.\\
539 - I figured I was spraying it anyway.\\
540 - * Men. *\\
541 - (doorbell rings)\\
542 - Oh, hey, Judith.\\
543 - What's up?\\
544 - Actually, quite a bit.\\
545 - Is something wrong?\\
546 - No, uh, it's just, um,\\
547 - I think it's time you knew the truth.\\
548 - What truth?\\
549 - Marlene Melnick is your daughter.\\
550 - I knew it!\\
551 - For 14 years I've known it.\\
552 - Well, I told her everything\\
553 - and she wants to live with her real dad.\\
554 - That's great.\\
555 - It's okay, honey.\\
556 - Come on in.\\
557 - Hi, Daddy.\\
558 - Got anything to eat?\\
559 - I'm a wuss.
\subsection {Episode 14: David Copperfield Slipped Me a Roofie}
1 - Would you like the last sausage?\\
2 - Oh, how about we split it?\\
3 - Okay.\\
4 - Meet you in the middle.\\
5 - Oh.\\
6 - Okay.\\
7 - Sexy.\\
8 - CHARLIE: Aw.\\
9 - Nothing says love like a little morning pork.\\
10 - Oh, hey.\\
11 - You're home early.\\
12 - How was Vegas?\\
13 - (sighs)\\
14 - Never again.\\
15 - Oh, you lost?\\
16 - No, Alan.\\
17 - I won so much freaking money that I'm embarrassed to go back.\\
18 - All right... well, uh,\\
19 - you remember Melissa?\\
20 - Of course he remembers me, Alan.\\
21 - He deflowered me, then dumped me.\\
22 - No offense, sweetheart, but your flower\\
23 - had been plucked and potted long before I met you.\\
24 - Okay, okay, look.\\
25 - Look, we're all adults here.\\
26 - This doesn't have to be awkward, you know.\\
27 - I mean, sure... Melissa is my receptionist,\\
28 - and sure, she was with you,\\
29 - and sure, that ended badly, but, uh ...\\
30 - Okay, I guess this does have to be awkward.\\
31 - Honey, shouldn't we be getting ready for work?\\
32 - Yes, yes, let's do that.\\
33 - You want to shower together? Oh, great, great.\\
34 - Uh, let me just, uh, start without you.\\
35 - There's a couple of things I'd like to prewash.\\
36 - There's a mental image I didn't need.\\
37 - Charlie, I need to talk to you.\\
38 - I'm sorry I was a jerk.\\
39 - I'm happy for you and Alan,\\
40 - and I will kick myself for the rest of my life\\
41 - for losing someone as special as you.\\
42 - No, silly, it's about something else.\\
43 - Oh, good, 'cause evenI didn't believe that.\\
44 - Alan's birthday is next Saturday.\\
45 - Really?\\
46 - I don't think so.\\
47 - Yeppers. He's gonna be 40.\\
48 - Wow, that is so weird.\\
49 - My baby brother's gonna be 40.\\
50 - How old are you?\\
51 - 39.\\
52 - That's what makes it so weird.\\
53 - Anyway, I think we should have a party for him.\\
54 - Why?\\
55 - Because it's an important birthday,\\
56 - and he deserves a big party\\
57 - with all his friends and loved ones.\\
58 - All right... all right, let's break this down.\\
59 - You want him to get what he deserves.\\
60 - You want it to be with his friends and loved ones,\\
61 - and you want it to be big.\\
62 - Uh-huh. Pick one.\\
63 - Come on, Charlie. Don't be such a pooper.\\
64 - If it's gonna be a fun party, I need your help.\\
65 - You want it to be fun?\\
66 - Don't invite Alan.\\
67 - Charlie... Okay.\\
68 - Okay, you know who would love to help you out with this?\\
69 - Our mom.\\
70 - Really? Oh, yeah.\\
71 - Nothing she likes better\\
72 - than extending herself for other people.\\
73 - Good idea.\\
74 - I'll give her a call.\\
75 - You do that.\\
76 - Wait till she hears Alan's 40.\\
77 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
78 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
79 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
80 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh... *\\
81 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
82 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
83 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
84 - * Men.\\
85 - Charlie.\\
86 - Wake up. I need to talk to you.\\
87 - CHARLIE: Don't move.\\
88 - Don't blink.\\
89 - Maybe she'll think you're dead and leave.\\
90 - I know you can hear me, Charlie.\\
91 - She's bluffing.\\
92 - Just stay still.\\
93 - (nasally): Okay, don't panic.\\
94 - You've experienced oxygen deprivation before.\\
95 - I can't breathe, Mom.\\
96 - Oh, good, you're awake.\\
97 - What can I do for you?\\
98 - I received a very unsettling message on my answering machine,\\
99 - and I would like you to explain it to me.\\
100 - Okay, look.\\
101 - Sometimes the liquor makes me say hateful things.\\
102 - No, this message was from some woman named Melissa.\\
103 - Alan's receptionist.\\
104 - Really?\\
105 - From the sound of her voice, I'd guess she earns her living\\
106 - baking cookies in a hollow tree.\\
107 - Anyway, she's somehow gotten it into her head\\
108 - that Alan is turning 40 on Saturday.\\
109 - Yeah, so?\\
110 - Is she insane?\\
111 - Running around telling people my son is 40?\\
112 - I know.\\
113 - She's a bad person.\\
114 - That's not all.\\
115 - She wants me to help with a party.\\
116 - Where in God's name\\
117 - could she have gotten such an idea?\\
118 - Beats me.\\
119 - Maybe the fact that you're his mother\\
120 - confused the poor girl.\\
121 - (toilet flushing)\\
122 - Oh, you're up.\\
123 - You've been cleaning in there this whole time?\\
124 - Sure, let's say I was cleaning.\\
125 - Hey, Uncle Charlie, if you're going out today,\\
126 - can I pull your car out of the garage?\\
127 - No, I don't want you pulling my car out of the garage.\\
128 - Okay, I won't.\\
129 - From now on.\\
130 - Hey, what's, uh... what's going on up here?\\
131 - Oh, terrific.\\
132 - This meeting of the worst club in the history of the world\\
133 - can now come to order.\\
134 - Madam President, you have the floor.\\
135 - Oh, I get it.\\
136 - Sorry to interrupt.\\
137 - Go back to what you were planning...\\
138 - uh, uh doing, uh, whatever.\\
139 - (chuckling)\\
140 - Oh, uh, apropos of nothing,\\
141 - uh, I like red velvet cake and close-up magic.\\
142 - Oh, crap.\\
143 - Now we have to throw him a party.\\
144 - Who?\\
145 - Your father.\\
146 - Why?\\
147 - It's his birthday.\\
148 - Oh.\\
149 - Can I bring a date?\\
150 - You got a date?\\
151 - That depends.\\
152 - On what?\\
153 - Can I borrow your car?\\
154 - You don't got a date.\\
155 - * Men.\\
156 - You know, we don't have to go out to dinner\\
157 - just 'cause it's my birthday.\\
158 - Don't be silly.\\
159 - This is a very special night.\\
160 - How many times do you turn 40?\\
161 - In my family, three or four.\\
162 - Well, the first time is the one that counts.\\
163 - Okay.\\
164 - So... so, it's just us, right?\\
165 - Of course, it's just us.\\
166 - Who else would it be?\\
167 - I don't know.\\
168 - My friends, family.\\
169 - A close-up magician.\\
170 - Oh, darn, what gave it away?\\
171 - Well, when I left the house, Jake was taking a shower,\\
172 - uh, Charlie had on long pants,\\
173 - and Berta said she had to quit early\\
174 - because she was going to some loser's birthday party.\\
175 - Oh, good, I had her down as a "maybe."\\
176 - Promise you'll act surprised.\\
177 - * Men.\\
178 - ALAN: Oh!\\
179 - Oh, my God, what a surprise!\\
180 - I don't know these people.\\
181 - We have a private room.\\
182 - Sorry.\\
183 - (chuckling)\\
184 - We got a private room.\\
185 - Go back to your dinner.\\
186 - Ooh, gazpacho.\\
187 - This is so nice.\\
188 - (loudly): A private, intimate dinner for just the two of us.\\
189 - Oh, my God, you guys!\\
190 - There's nobody here.\\
191 - I don't understand it.\\
192 - I told them to be here an hour ago.\\
193 - Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?\\
194 - My family are a bunch of thoughtless,\\
195 - selfish butt-wipes.\\
196 - Surprise.\\
197 - * Men.\\
198 - MELISSA: Evelyn, smile.\\
199 - That's a keeper.\\
200 - Listen, darling, are you going to be cutting the cake soon?\\
201 - Because, actually, I have a real party to go to.\\
202 - You can't go.\\
203 - We haven't even done the speeches yet.\\
204 - Oh, of course.\\
205 - Were we supposed to write speeches?\\
206 - For what?\\
207 - For Alan.\\
208 - Let him write his own speech.\\
209 - (glass clinking)\\
210 - Uh, can I have your attention, please?\\
211 - I want to thank you all for coming\\
212 - to celebrate this wonderful occasion.\\
213 - I thought it was Alan's birthday.\\
214 - And now it's time to say a few words\\
215 - about the guest of honor.\\
216 - I can think of a few words.\\
217 - (chuckling)\\
218 - Not only is he a terrific doctor\\
219 - and fantastic boss,\\
220 - he is also good and kind and smart\\
221 - and funny... and...\\
222 - a really swell kisser.\\
223 - I can still hear you.\\
224 - WOMAN: Sorry I'm late.\\
225 - I was burning a fatty\\
226 - with one of the busboys in the parking lot.\\
227 - How are you?\\
228 - Everyone, this is my mother, Shelly.\\
229 - Mom, this is Alan's mother, Evelyn, and...\\
230 - Sweetie, save your breath, because I'm way too toasted\\
231 - to remember a lot of names.\\
232 - (giggling)\\
233 - Ooh, bread.\\
234 - All right, well, uh, now that we're all here,\\
235 - why don't we take turns saying something\\
236 - about Alan and how much he means to us.\\
237 - Okay, Jake, you want to start?\\
238 - No, I got to go make room for cake.\\
239 - Uh, Berta, why don't you get the ball rolling?\\
240 - Sure.\\
241 - What the hell?\\
242 - Zippy, I got to tell you,\\
243 - when you first moved in, I didn't really care for you.\\
244 - (chuckling)\\
245 - You were a persnickety,\\
246 - self-righteous, smug son of a bitch.\\
247 - And now\\
248 - here we are, six years later.\\
249 - Thank you.\\
250 - Hear, hear.\\
251 - Oh, okay.\\
252 - Anyone else? SHELLY: Okay.\\
253 - I'll go.\\
254 - I have pictures of myself\\
255 - dressed in a forest ranger uniform,\\
256 - and I have absolutely no memory\\
257 - of ever working as a forest ranger.\\
258 - Thank you.\\
259 - All righty.\\
260 - Uh, who's next?\\
261 - Evelyn?\\
262 - Me?\\
263 - Isn't it enough I carried him\\
264 - for seven and a half months?\\
265 - You'd be surprised how many women\\
266 - opt for the full nine.\\
267 - Come on, Evelyn, you have to say something.\\
268 - Oh, fine.\\
269 - Alan, darling.\\
270 - You were always the good son.\\
271 - Of course, your brother didn't set the bar very high.\\
272 - Hear, hear. Wait a minute.\\
273 - Charlie, do you want to say anything?\\
274 - Uh, all right.\\
275 - (clears throat)\\
276 - Alan, you're my little brother.\\
277 - And I know over the years\\
278 - I've tormented you.\\
279 - I've embarrassed you in public.\\
280 - I've tied you to streetlights, car bumpers,\\
281 - the occasional angry animal...\\
282 - Oh, remember that Fourth of July when I used your ass\\
283 - as a launch pad for my bottle rockets?\\
284 - (chuckles)\\
285 - Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is...\\
286 - thanks for the memories.\\
287 - That's it?\\
288 - That's all you have to say?\\
289 - I suppose I could talk about his bed-wetting.\\
290 - You people are horrible.\\
291 - No. Honey, it's okay.\\
292 - No-no-no-no, it's not okay.\\
293 - You should be ashamed of yourselves.\\
294 - This is a warm and wonderful human being\\
295 - and he deserves more, especially from his family.\\
296 - I don't even know why you guys showed up tonight.\\
297 - Well, I can't speak for anybody else,\\
298 - but I'm getting overtime.\\
299 - Come on, Alan. We're leaving.\\
300 - Really? Before the cake?\\
301 - You don't need people who don't appreciate you.\\
302 - Uh, well, no, but I do kind of need Charlie's house.\\
303 - No, you don't.\\
304 - You'll come live with me and Mom. Right, Mom?\\
305 - You know, I did spend a summer in Yosemite doing shrooms,\\
306 - so maybe I wasn't an official forest ranger.\\
307 - Let's go.\\
308 - Mom, we're leaving.\\
309 - Okay.\\
310 - I'm sorry. This is the best bread I ever had.\\
311 - Who likes magic?\\
312 - I shaved for this?\\
313 - * Men. *\\
314 - Berta?\\
315 - Who's asking?\\
316 - What's wrong?\\
317 - Too much celebrating last night.\\
318 - I didn't notice you drinking at Alan's party.\\
319 - No, afterward.\\
320 - With the magician at his place.\\
321 - You went back to his place?\\
322 - Well, technically, his van.\\
323 - Well, why didn't you just stay home?\\
324 - If I stay home, you don't pay me.\\
325 - So you just came in to lie on my couch?\\
326 - Tough times, Charlie.\\
327 - Some people are living in their vans.\\
328 - (phone ringing)\\
329 - Oh, make it stop!\\
330 - Hello?\\
331 - Hi, Mom.\\
332 - Alan? Nah, he didn't come home.\\
333 - You're right.\\
334 - We were funny.\\
335 - He just overreacted.\\
336 - I'm sure he'll come back eventually.\\
337 - He always does.\\
338 - You should've named him "Herpes."\\
339 - Yeah, I wish I'd thought of it last night, too.\\
340 - Talk to you later.\\
341 - So what are we going to do today?\\
342 - Aren't you going to ask about your dad?\\
343 - What about him?\\
344 - Were we not at the same party last night?\\
345 - Did you not notice\\
346 - when you finally came out of the toilet\\
347 - that your father was gone?\\
348 - You know, now that you mention it...\\
349 - Herpes, Jr.\\
350 - Oh.\\
351 - Look who's back.\\
352 - I'm not back.\\
353 - I just came to get my stuff.\\
354 - You're really going to milk this thing, huh?\\
355 - I'm not milking anything, Charlie.\\
356 - There is no milk.\\
357 - I'm moving in with Melissa and her mother.\\
358 - Sounds like milk to me.\\
359 - I need to be someplace where I'm appreciated,\\
360 - someplace where I'm nurtured and loved.\\
361 - (mooing)\\
362 - You're not taking me seriously, are you?\\
363 - Oh, come on, Alan.\\
364 - You ain't going anywhere.\\
365 - You know it. I know it.\\
366 - The seagulls out there crapping on my deck know it.\\
367 - "You think he'll be back?"\\
368 - "Oh, yeah."\\
369 - No, no. This is it.\\
370 - This is where I cut the cord!\\
371 - Oh, man.\\
372 - I think David Copperfield slipped me a roofie.\\
373 - * Men. *\\
374 - I really appreciate you taking me in like this.\\
375 - Yeah, we love you, Alan.\\
376 - We want you here.\\
377 - You're a good man, and you have a beautiful soul.\\
378 - It is beautiful, isn't it?\\
379 - God forbid my family should notice.\\
380 - Oh, damn, I knew I'd forget something!\\
381 - What'd you forget? My son.\\
382 - Well, that's no problem.\\
383 - We'll just move Mom's hydroponic equipment\\
384 - out of the garage and make a bedroom for him.\\
385 - "Hydroponic equipment"?\\
386 - I'm a bit of a horticulturist.\\
387 - A little herb garden.\\
388 - Ah, okay.\\
389 - Well, uh, uh, just a heads-up,\\
390 - I love my son and everything,\\
391 - but he hasn't quite gotten to "beautiful soul" yet.\\
392 - He's more "methane cloud."\\
393 - He's still one of God's flowers.\\
394 - All he needs is a little love, ultraviolet light, potassium\\
395 - and he'll grow into some righteous chronic.\\
396 - * Men. *\\
397 - (snoring lightly)\\
398 - Quitting time.\\
399 - (TV playing music)\\
400 - What are you doing here?\\
401 - I'm watching TV.\\
402 - Why didn't you go with your dad?\\
403 - Dad was here?\\
404 - Yeah, he came by to get his stuff\\
405 - and I figured that included you.\\
406 - I'm not stuff, Uncle Charlie.\\
407 - I'm a human being.\\
408 - Don't flatter yourself.\\
409 - And turn off the TV.\\
410 - I'm taking you back to your mom's.\\
411 - Mom and Herb are in Mexico.\\
412 - For how long?\\
413 - I don't know.\\
414 - Turn off the TV.\\
415 - I'm taking you to Mexico.\\
416 - Can I drive?\\
417 - * Men. *\\
418 - You all comfy, cozy?\\
419 - Uh-huh.\\
420 - Mom made you some hot chocolate.\\
421 - Oh, thank you.\\
422 - Oh, and it's got those little marshmallows.\\
423 - I love those.\\
424 - Good. I'm going to the market.\\
425 - What would you like for dinner?\\
426 - Oh, gosh, I don't know.\\
427 - What do you want?\\
428 - I want to please you.\\
429 - Really?\\
430 - No one's ever said that to me before.\\
431 - Get used to it.\\
432 - (sobs)\\
433 - I'll try.\\
434 - Now, what can I get you?\\
435 - Um, well... you know the macaroni\\
436 - that's shaped like the little wagon wheels?\\
437 - I do.\\
438 - I like that with melted cheese.\\
439 - You got it.\\
440 - Oh, and maybe a couple of those bottled wine spritzers?\\
441 - Okeydoke.\\
442 - (door closes)\\
443 - * I'm getting mac and spritzers *\\
444 - * I'm getting mac and spritzers. *\\
445 - Here you go, bright eyes.\\
446 - I made you some banana bread.\\
447 - Aw, really? Mm-hmm.\\
448 - Banana bread? Oh, thank you.\\
449 - Wow, it's still warm.\\
450 - Mmm, right out of the oven.\\
451 - Mmm. Oh, that's, uh, that's very unusual.\\
452 - Uh, I'm tasting bananas and, uh, what is that, nutmeg?\\
453 - Nope.\\
454 - Mmm, that's good.\\
455 - You know what? You might want to just start\\
456 - with half a piece.\\
457 - I can't believe it.\\
458 - Believe what?\\
459 - I think I miss him.\\
460 - Miss who?\\
461 - Your father. Oh.\\
462 - What about you?\\
463 - What about me what?\\
464 - Do you miss him?\\
465 - Who?\\
466 - Your father.\\
467 - Why? Where is he?\\
468 - * Men. *\\
469 - Honey, they didn't have any spritzers, so I got you\\
470 - 7Up and sangria.\\
471 - * Nights in white satin\\
472 - * Never reaching the end\\
473 - * Letters I've written...\\
474 - Alan?!\\
475 - Oh, hey, baby.\\
476 - Have you tried your mom's banana bread?\\
477 - * Men. *\\
478 - I'm back.\\
479 - I'm shocked.\\
480 - Hey, Alan?\\
481 - Yeah?\\
482 - Happy birthday.\\
483 - Thank you.\\
484 - I told you he'd be back.\\
485 - Who?
\subsection {Episode 15: I'd Like to Start with the Cat}
1 - (both panting)\\
2 - Oh, man.\\
3 - That was intense.\\
4 - I need some fluids.\\
5 - I must have been down a quart.\\
6 - Guess that makes you up a quart, huh?\\
7 - Hey.\\
8 - You know what would be good right now?\\
9 - A pudding cup.\\
10 - I got some in the fridge.\\
11 - You want one?\\
12 - (sobbing)\\
13 - Um...\\
14 - you have a bad experience with pudding?\\
15 - What are we doing, Charlie?\\
16 - Well, you're crying, and my best guess\\
17 - is I'm about to apologize for something.\\
18 - Every time I come over, it's the same routine.\\
19 - We have Chinese takeout. Then we have sex.\\
20 - Then we roll over and go to sleep.\\
21 - Which is why I suggested the pudding.\\
22 - You know, mix it up a little.\\
23 - Besides, what about all the wonderful talking\\
24 - and joking and, you know, sharing we do?\\
25 - Sharing?\\
26 - What do we share, Charlie?\\
27 - Well, uh, we share Chinese takeout.\\
28 - And, uh... hey, the other night,\\
29 - we watched the Laker game together.\\
30 - You watched it over my shoulder while we were having sex.\\
31 - Oh, come on. It was overtime.\\
32 - What kind of relationship is this?\\
33 - We don't go anywhere. We don't do anything.\\
34 - Where do you want to go?\\
35 - What do you want to do?\\
36 - I can get Laker tickets.\\
37 - I don't want to go to a basketball game!\\
38 - I want to know who you are.\\
39 - I want you to know who I am.\\
40 - I know who you are.\\
41 - You do?\\
42 - Okay, what's my middle name?\\
43 - Your middle name.\\
44 - Okay.\\
45 - I know this.\\
46 - Sunburned boobs...\\
47 - What?\\
48 - Hang on. Hang on.\\
49 - Sunburned boobs...\\
50 - red boobs, red breasts.\\
51 - Robin.\\
52 - Little memory trick.\\
53 - My middle name is Christine.\\
54 - Not a very good trick.\\
55 - Who's my best friend?\\
56 - Where do I work?\\
57 - What's my cat's name?\\
58 - What's my favorite movie?\\
59 - What kind of music do I like?\\
60 - What religion was I raised in?\\
61 - And do I have any brothers and sisters?\\
62 - Okay, I'd like to start with the cat.\\
63 - I'm gonna go with...\\
64 - Fluffy.\\
65 - Drop dead.\\
66 - Snowball?\\
67 - Mr. Mittens?\\
68 - Tiger?\\
69 - Whiskers, Puss-Puss?\\
70 - (door slamming)\\
71 - Oh, come on.\\
72 - What's my middle name?\\
73 - Francis.\\
74 - No, it's not.\\
75 - Yes, it is!\\
76 - Show-off.\\
77 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
78 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
79 - * Men.\\
80 - Oh, Chelsea, come on.\\
81 - How much do I need to know about you\\
82 - other than I'm crazy about you?\\
83 - It's not that you don't know.\\
84 - It's that you don't care.\\
85 - I do care.\\
86 - I just don't pay close attention.\\
87 - Good-bye, Charlie.\\
88 - I mean, I pay attention, but I don't test well.\\
89 - Damn.\\
90 - What did you do, bring out the handcuffs too early?\\
91 - Apparently, I don't know her middle name.\\
92 - It's Christine.\\
93 - How do you know? She told me.\\
94 - Why did she tell you? I asked her.\\
95 - Why did you ask? How else do you get to know a person?\\
96 - Go away.\\
97 - If a woman stormed out on me after sex,\\
98 - would you go away?\\
99 - That's beside the point.\\
100 - So, what happened?\\
101 - I don't know.\\
102 - We were having a nice night.\\
103 - Little lo mein, little sex.\\
104 - Then the crying started.\\
105 - Oh, yeah.\\
106 - Been there, done that.\\
107 - No, she was crying.\\
108 - She wants more out of our relationship.\\
109 - More what? I'm not sure.\\
110 - I know it's not pudding.\\
111 - Well, what did she say?\\
112 - She said I don't know her well enough.\\
113 - You tell me: what's more important to know?\\
114 - Her cat's name or which of her body parts\\
115 - you can't sneak up on?\\
116 - Well, I'm not sure\\
117 - one necessarily precludes the other.\\
118 - Yeah, well, I've never been mule-kicked\\
119 - for not knowing a cat's name.\\
120 - It doesn't matter.\\
121 - There's more where she came from.\\
122 - Speaking of which...\\
123 - where does she come from?\\
124 - I don't know, and I don't care.\\
125 - Davenport, Iowa.\\
126 - Bite me.\\
127 - Want to know her cat's name? No.\\
128 - It's Mandu.\\
129 - Mandu?\\
130 - Yeah, you know, Cat Mandu.\\
131 - It's cute, huh?\\
132 - Why was I thinking Puss-Puss?\\
133 - Because that's what you're always thinking.\\
134 - * Men.\\
135 - What happened to all the pudding cups?\\
136 - I guess your uncle ate them.\\
137 - All of them?\\
138 - There were two 12-packs.\\
139 - Have something else.\\
140 - No cookies?\\
141 - What the hell is going on around here?\\
142 - Hey, watch your mouth.\\
143 - I am watching it.\\
144 - It's empty. I need dessert.\\
145 - Son of a bitch.\\
146 - Jake!\\
147 - Frozen peas?\\
148 - What am I gonna do with frozen peas?\\
149 - Well, if you want dessert, have an apple.\\
150 - Not funny, Dad.\\
151 - * Men.\\
152 - You sure I can't interest you in a pudding cup?\\
153 - Thanks.\\
154 - I'm okay.\\
155 - How about a chocolate chunk cookie?\\
156 - No, thank you.\\
157 - Did you quit drinking?\\
158 - God, no.\\
159 - Why?\\
160 - You seem to be experimenting\\
161 - with a new sugar delivery system.\\
162 - Anything bothering you lately?\\
163 - Well, there is this one thing,\\
164 - but I don't know if it's medical or psychological.\\
165 - Tell me.\\
166 - Lately, I've passed up\\
167 - a couple of opportunities to get some strange.\\
168 - Strange?\\
169 - Um...\\
170 - women with whom I have not previously been acquainted.\\
171 - Oh, right, strange.\\
172 - Charming.\\
173 - Go on.\\
174 - Anyway, I was wondering if there's something wrong with me.\\
175 - Because you passed up meaningless sex with strangers?\\
176 - Exactly.\\
177 - That's not like me.\\
178 - Hey, you know, I bet "strange" comes from "stranger."\\
179 - I wouldn't be surprised.\\
180 - So, what else is going on with your life?\\
181 - Not much.\\
182 - I've been gaining a little weight for some reason.\\
183 - Maybe 'cause I haven't been sleeping well.\\
184 - Yeah, that's probably it.\\
185 - Oh, and this one girl I've been seeing pretty regularly\\
186 - decided to dump me.\\
187 - Huh.\\
188 - "Huh," what?\\
189 - Oh, nothing, it's just...\\
190 - sometimes I feel like I'm stealing your money.\\
191 - So, tell me about this woman.\\
192 - Chelsea?\\
193 - Not much to tell.\\
194 - She's beautiful, sexy, smart, independent.\\
195 - Sometimes when she laughs,\\
196 - she makes a little snorting noise.\\
197 - It's really cute.\\
198 - Kind of like...\\
199 - (giggling, snorting)\\
200 - Not as cute when I do it.\\
201 - Sounds like quite a catch.\\
202 - She's okay.\\
203 - Why did she dump you?\\
204 - Who can understand a woman's mind?\\
205 - Yeah, we're pretty little puzzles, ain't we?\\
206 - So, it's not just me.\\
207 - Anyway, for some reason,\\
208 - she suddenly became dissatisfied with our relationship.\\
209 - Well, describe the relationship.\\
210 - It was great.\\
211 - She'd come over a couple times a week.\\
212 - Either she'd bring food or I'd have something delivered.\\
213 - We'd have sex, then eat.\\
214 - Then, maybe have sex again, depending on what was on TV.\\
215 - And she became dissatisfied with that?\\
216 - I know, right?\\
217 - Ooh.\\
218 - Butterscotch.\\
219 - So, how did you feel about losing her?\\
220 - What do you mean? What do I mean?\\
221 - Come on, Charlie.\\
222 - Dr. Seuss could diagnose this.\\
223 - You're stuffing yourself with crap\\
224 - to suppress your negative feelings.\\
225 - No, I'm pretty sure that's why I drink.\\
226 - You have a choice here.\\
227 - You can dig down and confront your feelings\\
228 - so they won't be controlling your behavior,\\
229 - or you can keep eating pudding and cookies\\
230 - until you have more chins than a Chinese phone book.\\
231 - Hmm.\\
232 - No, what else you got?\\
233 - Do you have a better idea?\\
234 - What if I could get Chelsea back?\\
235 - That would only be a temporary solution.\\
236 - So?\\
237 - That's what people said about bourbon,\\
238 - and we've been together for almost 30 years.\\
239 - Okay, you're right.\\
240 - Go get Chelsea back, and all your problems will be solved.\\
241 - I'm sensing sarcasm.\\
242 - Oh, good, we're finally making progress.\\
243 - * Men.\\
244 - Here you go.\\
245 - What are you drinking?\\
246 - Chocolate caramel frappuccino\\
247 - with whipped cream and sprinkles.\\
248 - My nephew turned me on to it.\\
249 - You want some?\\
250 - No, thanks, I had a hot fudge sundae for breakfast.\\
251 - Ooh, that sounds good.\\
252 - (slurping)\\
253 - Ah.\\
254 - You look nice.\\
255 - I've got to get back to work, Charlie.\\
256 - What do you want?\\
257 - I just wanted to see you.\\
258 - See how you're doing.\\
259 - I'm fine.\\
260 - Good.\\
261 - And how's your family back in...\\
262 - Davenport, Iowa?\\
263 - I'm from Champaign, Illinois.\\
264 - You sure?\\
265 - I'm sure.\\
266 - Bastard set me up.\\
267 - What?\\
268 - Nothing, nothing.\\
269 - I miss you.\\
270 - I miss you, too, but it doesn't matter.\\
271 - Our relationship wasn't going anywhere,\\
272 - and you are incapable of change.\\
273 - It's not that I'm incapable.\\
274 - I've just been unwilling.\\
275 - Thanks for clearing that up.\\
276 - No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.\\
277 - I've been seeing a shrink.\\
278 - Really?\\
279 - Yeah, and I'm making a lot of progress\\
280 - confronting my-- what do you call them?-- personal issues.\\
281 - Well, I'm glad to hear it.\\
282 - (tapping): Come.\\
283 - Sit.\\
284 - And check this out: the shrink's a woman.\\
285 - A real ballbuster.\\
286 - I can't get away with anything.\\
287 - Ballbuster?\\
288 - In a good way.\\
289 - You know, a buster of emotional balls.\\
290 - You should meet her.\\
291 - Are you suggesting we go to couples counseling?\\
292 - Um...\\
293 - Sure.\\
294 - I mean, I want to work on our relationship,\\
295 - and what better way than couples counseling?\\
296 - You're serious.\\
297 - Well, of course I'm serious.\\
298 - What, you think I'd blurt out something like that\\
299 - in the spur of the moment in a desperate attempt\\
300 - to keep you from leaving?\\
301 - It occurred to me.\\
302 - Well, clearly, you don't know me as well as you should.\\
303 - All right.\\
304 - Couples counseling.\\
305 - Wow, I'm impressed, Charlie.\\
306 - (chuckling): Me, too.\\
307 - Okay, I got to run.\\
308 - Let me know when our appointment is.\\
309 - Sure thing.\\
310 - Bye-bye.\\
311 - Oh, God, what have I done?\\
312 - * Men.\\
313 - * Men.\\
314 - Davenport, Iowa?\\
315 - Oh.\\
316 - Uh, did I say Davenport, Iowa?\\
317 - I meant Champaign, Illinois.\\
318 - Okay.\\
319 - That's one for you.\\
320 - Thank you. (chuckles)\\
321 - Ow!\\
322 - And that's one for me.\\
323 - Now, I need some advice.\\
324 - Oh, and just a friendly heads-up.\\
325 - You screw with me again, it's gonna cost you some teeth.\\
326 - I'm listening.\\
327 - Wait a minute.\\
328 - What's this about?\\
329 - Oh, he bought some stuff with his own money,\\
330 - and he doesn't want you eating it.\\
331 - Huh.\\
332 - You've been to couples counseling, right?\\
333 - Yeah, why?\\
334 - I'm going with Chelsea,\\
335 - and I need to know what I'm getting into.\\
336 - Oh, you're gonna love it.\\
337 - I am?\\
338 - Absolutely.\\
339 - Once a week, you sit on a couch with your significant other\\
340 - while she snips off your testicles,\\
341 - reaches up inside your chest cavity\\
342 - and goes like this...\\
343 - to your heart.\\
344 - That doesn't sound very good.\\
345 - Oh, it's horrible.\\
346 - But it's worth it\\
347 - because you're paying a stranger to watch\\
348 - while your life goes down the toilet.\\
349 - Along with your money and your house and your car\\
350 - and every last shred of your self-respect!\\
351 - You know, maybe you're not the right guy to ask.\\
352 - Oh, no.\\
353 - No, no, no, I'm the perfect guy to ask.\\
354 - When Judith and I started,\\
355 - we were just a couple with a few problems.\\
356 - When we finished, I came to live on your couch!\\
357 - God bless couples counseling!\\
358 - That better not be one of my pudding cups.\\
359 - Nope.\\
360 - * Men.\\
361 - (sighs)\\
362 - Hi, Charlie.\\
363 - Come on in.\\
364 - Shouldn't we wait for Chelsea?\\
365 - She's already here.\\
366 - Really?\\
367 - That seems a little ambushy.\\
368 - Hi, sweetie.\\
369 - You're late.\\
370 - I know. I know.\\
371 - I'm sorry.\\
372 - But... (clears throat)\\
373 - I have a good excuse.\\
374 - Happy first day of counseling.\\
375 - You brought a present?\\
376 - Yeah.\\
377 - Isn't that the protocol?\\
378 - No.\\
379 - So...\\
380 - you don't want this bottle of champagne?\\
381 - Bastard got me again.\\
382 - Well, why don't we get started.\\
383 - Hold on. Hold on.\\
384 - Does the name "Mandu" ring any kind of a bell?\\
385 - What?\\
386 - I'm gonna kill him.\\
387 - Well, why don't we start out with why we're here\\
388 - and what our goals are.\\
389 - Chelsea, would you like to go first?\\
390 - Sure.\\
391 - I want to know if my relationship\\
392 - with Charlie can be more than...\\
393 - sex, TV, and Chinese food.\\
394 - It can.\\
395 - Right, Doc?\\
396 - Of course it can.\\
397 - Thank you.\\
398 - Well, this is good.\\
399 - This is progress.\\
400 - I have to say this has been a very good session.\\
401 - Where do you think you're going?\\
402 - Nowhere.\\
403 - Just...\\
404 - stretching my legs.\\
405 - Charlie, before you got here, Chelsea mentioned\\
406 - that she feels you've fallen into a rut.\\
407 - A rut?\\
408 - We're not in a rut.\\
409 - When's the last time we did something new?\\
410 - (sighs)\\
411 - Hello?\\
412 - Great... and what else?\\
413 - Uh...\\
414 - He's got nothing.\\
415 - Excuse me, but if this is gonna work,\\
416 - you can't jump all over me while I'm thinking.\\
417 - I'm sorry. Go ahead.\\
418 - Thank you.\\
419 - I got nothing.\\
420 - Okay, might I make a suggestion?\\
421 - Would you be willing to commit to Chelsea\\
422 - that maybe once a week, twice a month,\\
423 - you do something together\\
424 - completely outside your comfort zone?\\
425 - Done. No problem.\\
426 - So, we could go to the ballet,\\
427 - the opera, visit my parents,\\
428 - hang out with my brother,\\
429 - go hiking with my friends?\\
430 - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
431 - I was thinking more like renting a chick flick\\
432 - and ordering Italian.\\
433 - This is hopeless.\\
434 - No, no, no, no, there's hope.\\
435 - There's always hope.\\
436 - Keep hope alive.\\
437 - I can do those things.\\
438 - Come.\\
439 - Sit.\\
440 - Charlie, has it ever occurred to you\\
441 - that you might enjoy doing new things\\
442 - and meeting new people?\\
443 - I know I'm supposed to say yes, but...\\
444 - every fiber of my body is screaming, "No!"\\
445 - All right, then I have to ask.\\
446 - Given that you and Chelsea are such different people,\\
447 - why do you want to be in this relationship?\\
448 - Well...\\
449 - 'Cause I'm crazy about her.\\
450 - 'Cause, when I'm with somebody else,\\
451 - I'm thinking of her.\\
452 - Not that I've been with anybody else.\\
453 - Tell her, Doc.\\
454 - He passed up strange.\\
455 - See, that's got to mean something,\\
456 - considering how I used to, you know, live for strange.\\
457 - First time in the sack,\\
458 - she was the strange.\\
459 - Charlie, can I give you my opinion as your therapist?\\
460 - Sure. Shut up.\\
461 - Oh, God, I wish I could.\\
462 - Chelsea, look.\\
463 - I know I'm not perfect. (chuckles)\\
464 - Hey, hey, hey.\\
465 - I'm sorry.\\
466 - That was probably unprofessional.\\
467 - Anyway,\\
468 - you need to know\\
469 - that you mean everything to me,\\
470 - and I'll do whatever it takes to make this work.\\
471 - You really mean that?\\
472 - I do.\\
473 - Thank you, Charlie.\\
474 - Well, this has been very helpful.\\
475 - Sit down, Charlie. Sit down, Charlie.\\
476 - We're not done?\\
477 - Not even close.\\
478 - Oh, boy.\\
479 - What else could we possibly have to talk about?\\
480 - Well, there's always your mother\\
481 - and the fact that your relationship issues\\
482 - are linked to your anger towards her,\\
483 - as well as fear of your latent homosexuality.\\
484 - It was kind of a rhetorical question.\\
485 - * Men.\\
486 - * Men.\\
487 - ALAN: Charlie?\\
488 - Yeah.\\
489 - How was couples counseling?\\
490 - You really want to know?\\
491 - Sure.\\
492 - Tell me everything.\\
493 - Oh!\\
494 - Ow!\\
495 - Why?\\
496 - Why would you do that?\\
497 - You know, I've been asking myself the same thing,\\
498 - and the only thing I can come up with is:\\
499 - it's really, really funny.\\
500 - Go ahead.\\
501 - Yuk it up.\\
502 - Those were among the worst\\
503 - 50 minutes of my entire life.\\
504 - I told you.\\
505 - Didn't I tell you?\\
506 - Yep.\\
507 - You told me.\\
508 - I bet you left with your gonads in a guppy bag.\\
509 - I didn't get a bag.\\
510 - Going back next week?\\
511 - Uh-huh.\\
512 - $180 an hour?\\
513 - $240. Ooh.\\
514 - Licensed.\\
515 - (chuckling)\\
516 - You two kids will patch things up in no time.\\
517 - Hey, just because counseling didn't help your relationships\\
518 - doesn't mean it won't help mine.\\
519 - Right, right.\\
520 - Keep drinking that old Kool-Aid.\\
521 - Looking for something?\\
522 - Don't screw with me, kid.\\
523 - Now, hand over the pudding or you'll be sorry.\\
524 - Have an apple.\\
525 - Little turd called my bluff.\\
526 - (laughing)\\
527 - (loud smack)\\
528 - ALAN: Ow!\\
529 - * Men.
\subsection {Episode 16: She'll Still Be Dead At Halftime}
1 - (crowd cheering, whistle blowing over TV)\\
2 - It seems to me that it would be more fair\\
3 - if everybody on both basketball teams\\
4 - was the same height.\\
5 - That's how it seems to you, huh?\\
6 - Yeah, like in boxing.\\
7 - Heavyweights fight heavyweights.\\
8 - Lightweights fight lightweights.\\
9 - So, in your world, everybody on a basketball team\\
10 - would be, say, 6'5",\\
11 - and they'd only play other teams\\
12 - that were 6'5".\\
13 - Exactly.\\
14 - That way, no one would have an unfair advantage.\\
15 - Huh.\\
16 - That's very interesting.\\
17 - You really think so?\\
18 - No, but it's less likely to start a fight\\
19 - than "That's the dumbest thing\\
20 - I've ever heard."\\
21 - And yet, you said it anyway.\\
22 - Listen, I've got to talk to you about something.\\
23 - Okay, "dumb" was a poor choice of words.\\
24 - It's not about that.\\
25 - Can it wait till halftime?\\
26 - No.\\
27 - (mutes TV)\\
28 - I've got to go to a funeral this weekend.\\
29 - Oh, man, I'm sorry.\\
30 - Who died?\\
31 - My ex-mother-in-law.\\
32 - That couldn't wait till halftime? Charlie.\\
33 - I'm just saying she'll still be dead at halftime.\\
34 - I was very close to her\\
35 - and I want to pay my respects,\\
36 - so I'm going to Santa Barbara,\\
37 - and I'll be spending the weekend with my ex-husband.\\
38 - Oh, okay.\\
39 - (TV audio resumes)\\
40 - ANNOUNCER: They certainly are very...\\
41 - Define "with."\\
42 - Well, everyone's staying at his parents' house.\\
43 - All right... well, do you want me to come with you?\\
44 - No. Great.\\
45 - ANNOUNCER: But, once again, Barry, most of...\\
46 - Why not?\\
47 - Do you want to come?\\
48 - Hell, no.\\
49 - That's what I figured.\\
50 - Look, I just want to be up-front with you.\\
51 - I was married to Alex for eight years,\\
52 - and I just don't want you to get the wrong idea.\\
53 - I wouldn't have had any idea\\
54 - if you hadn't felt the need to tell me.\\
55 - Yeah, well, I don't want us\\
56 - to have any secrets from each other.\\
57 - Oh, I agree.\\
58 - We definitely should not have secrets. Right.\\
59 - You know, from this point forward.\\
60 - ANNOUNCER: ...had control of the ball and lost the...\\
61 - What kind of guy is this Alex?\\
62 - He's a good guy.\\
63 - We just got married too young\\
64 - and wanted different things.\\
65 - He wanted something different than your things?\\
66 - 'Cause your things are terrific.\\
67 - Thank you.\\
68 - ANNOUNCER: Some golden opportunities to score.\\
69 - He didn't go gay on you, did he?\\
70 - No.\\
71 - Rats.\\
72 - Are you jealous?\\
73 - No, no.\\
74 - Of course not.\\
75 - I mean, maybe a little.\\
76 - You know, in the sense that his mother's dead.\\
77 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
78 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
79 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
80 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
81 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
82 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
83 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
84 - * Men.\\
85 - I miss you, too, honey.\\
86 - How was the funeral?\\
87 - Yeah, I guess they're all pretty sad.\\
88 - Probably why they don't call them fun-erals.\\
89 - (chuckling)\\
90 - Yeah, that was lame.\\
91 - So, where are you now, at the house?\\
92 - And where is your ex-husband?\\
93 - And where is his room in relationship to yours?\\
94 - Hey, hey, it's got nothing to do with jealousy.\\
95 - I just know, based on a lifetime of experience,\\
96 - that penises do not observe a traditional mourning period.\\
97 - Forget it, you are not driving my car\\
98 - until you get a learner's permit.\\
99 - Not even in the driveway?\\
100 - Not anywhere.\\
101 - What if you have a heart attack?\\
102 - Can I drive you to the hospital?\\
103 - No, call an ambulance.\\
104 - Fine.\\
105 - If they don't get here in time,\\
106 - can I have your car?\\
107 - Hey.\\
108 - There's my posse.\\
109 - What are we doing tonight, boys?\\
110 - Think big. It's my treat.\\
111 - Drunk?\\
112 - Probably.\\
113 - Where is Chelsea?\\
114 - She had to go out of town.\\
115 - Oh, so your girlfriend's gone for a couple of days.\\
116 - Now, suddenly, you have time for us?\\
117 - Yeah.\\
118 - You ever think that maybe Jake and I already have plans?\\
119 - That our lives go on even when you're not around?\\
120 - That we don't just pop into existence\\
121 - the moment you need us?\\
122 - I'm free.\\
123 - Me, too. I'm just making a point.\\
124 - So, what's it going to be?\\
125 - A movie, bowling?\\
126 - Putt-putt, Nevada cathouse?\\
127 - I vote for cathouse.\\
128 - Do you even know what a cathouse is?\\
129 - Not firsthand.\\
130 - That's why I voted for it.\\
131 - A movie would be fine.\\
132 - All right, a movie it is.\\
133 - What's out that's good?\\
134 - There's a new pirate movie.\\
135 - It's rated "Arr!"\\
136 - You guys have no sense of humor.\\
137 - * Men.\\
138 - Can we go to that new theater\\
139 - with the reserved seats and the jumbo kosher hot dogs?\\
140 - You just finished dinner.\\
141 - That doesn't mean I finished eating.\\
142 - Hey, Charlie.\\
143 - Wanda... what are you doing here?\\
144 - I was in the neighborhood, and I'm drunk and horny.\\
145 - New plan.\\
146 - * Men.\\
147 - Have I met this one before?\\
148 - I doubt it.\\
149 - She looks familiar.\\
150 - Blond, busty, and bombed?\\
151 - Around here, that's familiar.\\
152 - I thought Uncle Charlie liked Chelsea.\\
153 - He does. Well, then, what's he doing with Wanda?\\
154 - Well, buddy, it's like this.\\
155 - Uh, despite his many admirable qualities,\\
156 - your Uncle Charlie is, at heart, a sleazeball.\\
157 - That's what I figured.\\
158 - I just wanted a second opinion.\\
159 - Hang on. I'll grab another bottle.\\
160 - Broad is part camel.\\
161 - Except the humps aren't on her back.\\
162 - Oh, come on.\\
163 - That was funnier than "Rated arr!"\\
164 - (sighs)\\
165 - Look, I know you're upset, but I'll take you\\
166 - to the movies some other time.\\
167 - This has nothing to do with the movie.\\
168 - Then what's the problem?\\
169 - The problem is you're a sleazeball.\\
170 - Really? How so?\\
171 - Oh, please.\\
172 - You're in a committed relationship\\
173 - with a wonderful woman,\\
174 - and the minute her back is turned,\\
175 - you're out gallivanting.\\
176 - Gallivanting? Screwing around.\\
177 - Then, why don't you just say, "Screwing around"?\\
178 - Hey, as we speak, Chelsea is doing the same thing I'm doing.\\
179 - Oh, really?\\
180 - She's pouring liquor down the throat\\
181 - of an inebriated party girl?\\
182 - Inebriated? Drunk.\\
183 - Geez, who are you showing off for?\\
184 - At this moment,\\
185 - Chelsea is in the same house as her ex-husband.\\
186 - Why? His mother died.\\
187 - Oh, my apologies.\\
188 - Clearly, anything you do at this point is justified.\\
189 - No, it's not. I was being disingenuous.\\
190 - What? Sarcastic.\\
191 - You know, this is why Mom gets pissed off at you so much.\\
192 - Look.\\
193 - Charlie, do what you want.\\
194 - If you can live with yourself, more power to you.\\
195 - If I could live with myself,\\
196 - we'd be having this conversation by telephone.\\
197 - See, him I understand.\\
198 - Charlie, bed, now, come.\\
199 - Succinct, ain't she?\\
200 - Does "succinct" mean what I think it means?\\
201 - I highly doubt it.\\
202 - Hello?\\
203 - Right here, baby.\\
204 - (loud thudding)\\
205 - Are you okay?\\
206 - Yeah, why?\\
207 - Never mind. (clears throat)\\
208 - Come on.\\
209 - Come on.\\
210 - Let's get you into bed.\\
211 - (sighs) Thank you.\\
212 - Hey, you remember when we were in Vegas\\
213 - and I talked that cute waitress into joining us?\\
214 - Yeah, I do.\\
215 - I saw her last week at the Hard Rock.\\
216 - No kidding.\\
217 - She gained a lot of weight.\\
218 - Is that so?\\
219 - Yeah, we were lucky.\\
220 - We nailed her right before she quit smoking.\\
221 - Listen, Wanda, uh...\\
222 - She does smell better, though.\\
223 - I'm sure, but listen...\\
224 - Like Fritos.\\
225 - You know what?\\
226 - I got to... check on something.\\
227 - Well, is it okay if I start without you?\\
228 - Top drawer, nightstand-- take your pick.\\
229 - Ooh.\\
230 - Careful.\\
231 - The big one's a flashlight.\\
232 - That was fast.\\
233 - I'm guessing.\\
234 - You're right.\\
235 - I'm a sleazeball.\\
236 - Don't tell me you actually had a moral epiphany.\\
237 - Uh, "epiphany" means... Don't bother.\\
238 - I don't know what you call it,\\
239 - but I've got a gorgeous, willing girl in my bed,\\
240 - and I'm just not interested.\\
241 - Maybe you're a gay sleazeball.\\
242 - I'll tell you what's going on.\\
243 - You care about Chelsea too much\\
244 - to cheapen your relationship\\
245 - with a meaningless one-night stand.\\
246 - You're right.\\
247 - I do care about Chelsea.\\
248 - I'm crazy about her.\\
249 - Boy, that sucks.\\
250 - (phone ringing)\\
251 - Hello.\\
252 - Oh, hey, Chelsea, we were just...\\
253 - Give me that.\\
254 - Hey, baby, what's going on?\\
255 - He did?\\
256 - At his own mother's funeral?\\
257 - Her ex-husband put the moves on her.\\
258 - What a sleazeball.\\
259 - No, no, no, don't blame yourself.\\
260 - You were right to go to the funeral.\\
261 - Tonight?\\
262 - (stammering): I'd love to see you tonight,\\
263 - but... isn't it a little late\\
264 - to drive all the way from Santa Barbara?\\
265 - Oh, you're already on the road.\\
266 - Oh, that close?\\
267 - Wonderful.\\
268 - Drive safe.\\
269 - Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap,\\
270 - crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.\\
271 - Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap,\\
272 - crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap...\\
273 - Remember when I was little and every time someone said "crap",\\
274 - they had to put a dollar in the swear jar?\\
275 - I do.\\
276 - Whatever happened to all that money?\\
277 - Wanda, I don't want you to take this the wrong way,\\
278 - but you got to get the hell out of here.\\
279 - Come on. Chop-chop.\\
280 - Wanda?\\
281 - (smacks lips)\\
282 - Wanda...!\\
283 - (snores)\\
284 - Oh, darn.\\
285 - *Men.*\\
286 - * Men.\\
287 - So the car's a time machine?\\
288 - Yeah, it's called a DeLorean.\\
289 - They don't make 'em anymore.\\
290 - CHARLIE: Crap, crap, crap, crap,\\
291 - crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.\\
292 - Help. I need help.\\
293 - Oh, my God, w-what happened? What's wrong?\\
294 - Wanda passed out and Chelsea's on her way over.\\
295 - Interesting story about the DeLorean.\\
296 - It was built by a man named John DeLorean.\\
297 - Are you not listening to me?\\
298 - I've got an emergency here.\\
299 - A dead girl in your bed is an emergency.\\
300 - A passed-out girl is a dinner date.\\
301 - I still don't understand why it's called Back to the Future.\\
302 - Because they're stuck in the past,\\
303 - and they have to get back...\\
304 - Home.\\
305 - Oh, for God's sake, come on!\\
306 - My girlfriend's on her way over,\\
307 - and I've got a half-naked broad upstairs!\\
308 - Half-naked. I'm your man.\\
309 - Sit down.\\
310 - Have you tried waking her up?\\
311 - Well, of course I've tried waking her up.\\
312 - This is not my first drunk bimbo!\\
313 - So, what do you expect us to do?\\
314 - I expect you to help me get her dressed and drive her home.\\
315 - Enough talk. Let's get to it.\\
316 - I said, sit down.\\
317 - Where does she live?\\
318 - I have no idea.\\
319 - So, how am I supposed to drive her home?\\
320 - Oh, come on. Do I have to think\\
321 - of everything?! Just help me!\\
322 - (sighs) All right.\\
323 - Wow.\\
324 - Oh, and I'm a sleazeball?\\
325 - You're-You're misreading my-my "wow."\\
326 - I meant "Wow, what a predicament."\\
327 - Yeah, right.\\
328 - You hold her up.\\
329 - I'll put her dress on.\\
330 - Okay.\\
331 - She's very fit.\\
332 - (grunts) Hold her arms up.\\
333 - Really soft skin.\\
334 - Uh-huh.\\
335 - Hmm. Smells nice, too.\\
336 - Okay, why don't you just put a chloroform-soaked handkerchief\\
337 - over her face and throw her in the back of your panel van?\\
338 - Sounds like a waste of chloroform, doesn't it?\\
339 - Okay, you get her head; I'll get her feet.\\
340 - Why do you get her feet?\\
341 - What difference does it make?\\
342 - I like feet.\\
343 - Just get her head.\\
344 - Okay, on three.\\
345 - One, two, three.\\
346 - Three. Oh! Oh! Oh!\\
347 - Goodness. Aah.\\
348 - (panting)\\
349 - Slowly, slowly.\\
350 - Slowly, my ass. Come on. Let's get her out of here.\\
351 - Charlie. Charlie...!\\
352 - Oh! (thudding)\\
353 - Goodness gracious, these are real.\\
354 - * Men.\\
355 - Slowly. Slowly.\\
356 - (doorbell rings)\\
357 - Quickly. Quickly.\\
358 - Hi, baby.\\
359 - Come on in.\\
360 - Oh, Charlie, you were so right about Alex.\\
361 - Alex?\\
362 - Oh, yeah. Alex.\\
363 - What a sleazeball.\\
364 - Can I get you something to drink?\\
365 - No. I just want to get in bed and hold you.\\
366 - Oh, boy, does that sound good.\\
367 - Let me just say good night to Jake.\\
368 - Okay. I'll meet you upstairs.\\
369 - You know what?\\
370 - Why don't you come say good night, too?\\
371 - Why?\\
372 - Well, you're my girlfriend, and he's my nephew,\\
373 - and... isn't that enough?\\
374 - Hey, Jake...\\
375 - Might want to hang back a sec.\\
376 - I just ripped off an air biscuit.\\
377 - What?\\
378 - I farted.\\
379 - Sorry. I get the fancy words from my dad.\\
380 - Anyway, Chelsea and I just wanted to say good night.\\
381 - Okay.\\
382 - He keeps his feelings bottled up.\\
383 - Everything else he shoots into the atmosphere.\\
384 - Hi, Chelsea.\\
385 - Hi, Alan.\\
386 - Uh, sorry to hear about your ex-mother-in-law.\\
387 - Oh, thank you. Oh, hey, Jake.\\
388 - I could really use your help. With what?\\
389 - I'm taking out the... Whew!\\
390 - I'm taking out the trash.\\
391 - What are you talking about?\\
392 - The trash.\\
393 - I'm taking it out,\\
394 - and I could use your help carrying it.\\
395 - Oh. So now you want my help?\\
396 - Yes, now I want your help.\\
397 - What about the 20 bucks you owe me?\\
398 - Charlie?\\
399 - Here.\\
400 - Is the trash still out where you can see it?\\
401 - Never mind.\\
402 - Just go help your father.\\
403 - Fine.\\
404 - Nice seeing you, Chelsea.\\
405 - Good night.\\
406 - I could have said 50, couldn't I?\\
407 - Could have said a hundred.\\
408 - Can we please go to bed now?\\
409 - Beds are for amateurs.\\
410 - Oh, Charlie.\\
411 - (sniffing)\\
412 - What if Jake comes back?\\
413 - We'll breathe through our mouths.\\
414 - She really does look familiar.\\
415 - Terrific. Just don't drop her.\\
416 - I can't wait to tell my friends about this.\\
417 - You're not telling anybody about this.\\
418 - What's the point of doing it if I can't tell anybody?\\
419 - You've got 20 bucks and a memory. Now shut up.\\
420 - Okay, we've got to get her in the car.\\
421 - You want me to pull it around? No, I don't want you to pull it around!\\
422 - Okay, well, then, you pull it around, I'll stay here with her.\\
423 - But be very careful.\\
424 - CHELSEA: Come on, let's finish this upstairs.\\
425 - Move, move, move!\\
426 - Chelsea, wait. What?\\
427 - I'm so happy you're back.\\
428 - Hey.\\
429 - Oh, hey, Alan.\\
430 - Is the trash out?\\
431 - Uh, almost.\\
432 - Almost ain't gonna cut it.\\
433 - Did you at least clean out my room?\\
434 - Yes, I did.\\
435 - Good. Good.\\
436 - Okay, well, good night.\\
437 - Uh, Charlie, can I talk to you for a sec?\\
438 - About what?\\
439 - Um... uh, recycling.\\
440 - I'm not quite sure what to do with the...\\
441 - big jugs.\\
442 - Oh. Honey, why don't you go up and get comfortable,\\
443 - and I'll be right there? Hurry.\\
444 - I will.\\
445 - Okay, first you need to separate the plastic from the glass.\\
446 - Then when you get to the newspaper...\\
447 - What the hell is your problem?\\
448 - She's in Jake's room.\\
449 - What am I supposed to do?\\
450 - I don't know.\\
451 - Here's my credit card.\\
452 - Take her to a hotel or something.\\
453 - Okay. Chain motel or someplace nicer?\\
454 - What?\\
455 - You know, uh, room service, ocean view.\\
456 - That way when she regains consciousness,\\
457 - she won't feel so cheap.\\
458 - Plus, in the nicer places,\\
459 - you have a free continental breakfast.\\
460 - Assorted pastries, coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice...\\
461 - I know what a continental breakfast is!\\
462 - Just get her the hell out of here!\\
463 - Okay, fine.\\
464 - Oh, Charlie?\\
465 - What?!\\
466 - I'm a little low on gas.\\
467 - Use the card!\\
468 - Right, right, right.\\
469 - Charlie?!\\
470 - What?!\\
471 - I'm really happy you're trying to make it work with Chelsea.\\
472 - Go!\\
473 - What the hell are you doing?\\
474 - You said I could have a memory.\\
475 - This is it.\\
476 - Give me the phone.\\
477 - Oh, good idea.\\
478 - I can't get us both in the frame.\\
479 - Can you make it look like we're talking to each other?\\
480 - Forget the picture.\\
481 - We have to bring the car around.\\
482 - Shouldn't someone stay here with Wanda?\\
483 - Yeah, but it shouldn't be you.\\
484 - Give me the keys.\\
485 - You said I could pull it around.\\
486 - I changed my mind.\\
487 - Okay. I'll tell Mom about Wanda.\\
488 - One ding, one scratch, and you're dead.\\
489 - Dude, mellow out.\\
490 - You'll give yourself a heart attack.\\
491 - (sighs)\\
492 - Hey, look!\\
493 - It's me!\\
494 - I'm glad you came back.\\
495 - I don't like it when you're gone.\\
496 - I don't like it when I'm gone, either.\\
497 - Oh. Here they are.\\
498 - Funny story.\\
499 - * Men.\\
500 - Why do you get to take her feet?\\
501 - Because I'm in charge of this operation,\\
502 - and I like feet.\\
503 - Hey.\\
504 - I guess we don't have to take her to a hotel, huh?\\
505 - No, we don't.\\
506 - Quick, get in the car.\\
507 - Where are we going?\\
508 - Anywhere we want. We've got Uncle Charlie's credit card.

4 - "The highlight reel"?\\
5 - Yeah, you know, "best of" moments\\
6 - for deathbed reflections.\\
7 - Only in your memory, right?\\
8 - Oh, yeah. Yeah.\\
9 - I got rid of the camcorder like I promised.\\
10 - Good.\\
11 - It's a shame.\\
12 - The camera really loves you.\\
13 - Shut up, Charlie.\\
14 - I'm not just saying that.\\
15 - Even from unflattering angles,\\
16 - you light up the screen.\\
17 - Oh, I hate you.\\
18 - That's too bad, 'cause I love you.\\

37 - Oh, my.\\
38 - Fitful night's sleep on Alcohol Island?\\
39 - Keep it up, funny man.\\
40 - You're going to be homeless, wearing a tube top\\
41 - and turning tricks on Santa Monica Boulevard.\\
42 - Wow.\\
43 - What crawled in your keister and built a nest?\\
44 - You want to know? You really want to know?\\
45 - I've fallen in love with Chelsea.\\
46 - Oh. Well, why are you so upset?\\
47 - Love is a beautiful thing.\\
48 - Beautiful thing, my ass.\\
49 - And we're back in your keister.\\
50 - Last night, in bed,\\
51 - I told her I loved her.\\
52 - And you know what she said?\\
53 - Uh... "I'm still not going to let you do that"?\\
54 - She said, "Thank you."\\
55 - Ooh, that's an ice cube to the man sack.\\
56 - I don't get it.\\
57 - I've gone the whole nine yards for this relationship.\\
58 - I gave her her own drawer in my bedroom.\\
59 - I stopped smoking cigars after sex.\\
60 - I even started seeing a shrink so I can be more sensitive,\\
61 - and I still can't get a freaking "I love you."\\
62 - But you've obviously become more sensitive.\\
63 - For what I've spent on therapy,\\
64 - I could get a couple of very expensive hookers\\
65 - who will say anything I want.\\
66 - There's that sensitivity again.\\
67 - Look at the bright side.\\
68 - What's the bright side?\\
69 - Well, when women do tell you they love you,\\
70 - it usually ends with them tossing a lit road flare\\
71 - through your bedroom window.\\
72 - That happened one time.\\
73 - Why can't you just be grateful for what you've got?\\
74 - What do I got?\\
75 - Oh, a woman who may not proclaim her love for you,\\
76 - but who doesn't try to set you on fire\\
77 - while you're sleeping.\\
78 - One time.\\
79 - Okay.\\
80 - A woman who may not proclaim her love for you,\\
81 - but who doesn't steal your Mercedes\\
82 - while you're passed out in the backseat\\
83 - and drive it into the Pacific Ocean.\\
84 - Another isolated incident.\\
85 - I believe I've made my point.\\
86 - I'm sorry, Alan.\\
87 - But not being drowned or burned by the woman I love\\
88 - is not enough for me.\\
89 - I want more.\\
90 - Oh, sure.\\
91 - Reach for the stars.\\
92 - * Men. *\\
93 - Hey, Charlie, how's it going?\\
94 - Boy, you really blew it this time.\\
95 - Did I now? How so?\\
96 - I've fallen in love with Chelsea.\\
97 - Ooh, my bad.\\
98 - Damn right, your bad.\\
99 - There were plenty of medications that would've turned me\\
100 - into a happy little potato,\\
101 - but would you prescribe them? No!\\
102 - You said I had to get in touch with my feelings\\
103 - and express them to the people I care about.\\
104 - Sorry, I must've been drunk.\\
105 - No. No, it's too late for excuses.\\
106 - I'm sensing something happened with Chelsea.\\
107 - Oh, you're good.\\
108 - There's no sliding anything past you.\\
109 - Hey,\\
110 - last night I dreamt I was a giant hot dog\\
111 - jumping through a doughnut that looked like my mother.\\
112 - What do you suppose that means?\\
113 - All right, Charlie, you've made your point.\\
114 - Now, tell me what happened.\\
115 - We can go back to the doughnut dream later.\\
116 - It wasn't a real dream.\\
117 - I was being sarcastic.\\
118 - Oh, I know, but the fact that you chose\\
119 - that particular imagery is a little troubling.\\
120 - Now, what happened with Chelsea?\\
121 - I told her I loved her, and you know what she said?\\
122 - This process isn't really about me guessing, Charlie.\\
123 - She said, "Thank you."\\
124 - Interesting.\\
125 - How did that make you feel?\\
126 - No, no, no, no, no! No more feelings.\\
127 - We tried it your way.\\
128 - Now, just take out your little prescription pad\\
129 - and start scribbling.\\
130 - You don't need medication, Charlie.\\
131 - You're actually making tremendous progress.\\
132 - Are you not listening to a thing I say?!\\
133 - I drift in and out.\\
134 - Look, the fact that you're upset about this\\
135 - tells me you've come a long way from the guy\\
136 - who first walked into this office.\\
137 - The guy who first walked into this office\\
138 - was a happy-go-lucky, fully-functioning man whore\\
139 - and I want him back.\\
140 - I'm guessing you don't mean that.\\
141 - Oh, now you're guessing?\\
142 - A minute ago it was, "That's not how the process works."\\
143 - A minute ago, it didn't.\\
144 - So are you still seeing Chelsea?\\
145 - Well, of course I'm still seeing her,\\
146 - but now the relationship's totally screwed.\\
147 - Why is that?\\
148 - She knows I love her.\\
149 - The whole balance of power is completely out of whack.\\
150 - Huh.\\
151 - Okay, I really don't like it when you give me the "huh."\\
152 - Huh.\\
153 - Now, you're just screwing with me, right?\\
154 - There's no sliding anything past you.\\
155 - So let's talk about this whole balance of power\\
156 - issue of yours. What about it?\\
157 - Why do you look at relationships as a power struggle?\\
158 - 'Cause that's what they are.\\
159 - Is that how you saw your parents' relationship,\\
160 - as a power struggle?\\
161 - Oh, there was no struggle.\\
162 - My father sat very quietly\\
163 - while my mother sucked the life out of him.\\
164 - I see, and you're terrified of that happening to you.\\
165 - No, I'm looking forward to it.\\
166 - In fact, I'm thinking about having\\
167 - a nozzle attached to my heart\\
168 - to make the sucking more convenient.\\
169 - Let me ask you something.\\
170 - What would it take for you feel\\
171 - that things were back in balance with Chelsea?\\
172 - Simple. She has to tell me she loves me.\\
173 - Even if she doesn't feel it?\\
174 - It's even better if she doesn't feel it.\\
175 - 'Cause that means she's only saying it\\
176 - 'cause she's afraid to lose me.\\
177 - Wow.\\
178 - "Wow"?\\
179 - What's "wow"?\\
180 - Kind of like "huh," but with a "wuh" and an "ow."\\
181 - Charlie, I would suggest that you forget about\\
182 - getting the "I love you" back and focus more\\
183 - on what it feels like to give love,\\
184 - maybe for the first time in your life.\\
185 - You know, I can get the drugs without you.\\
186 - I've got a nephew in junior high.\\
187 - Do what you got to do.\\
188 - Now, let's get back to that mom-shaped doughnut of yours.\\
189 - * Men. *\\
190 - So you really told her you loved her?\\
191 - Yeah.\\
192 - Were you loaded?\\
193 - No.\\
194 - Were you trying to get her to do something kinky?\\
195 - No.\\
196 - Did she catch you doing something kinky\\
197 - to somebody else?\\
198 - No.\\
199 - By yourself?\\
200 - No.\\
201 - Then I don't get it.\\
202 - What was your angle?\\
203 - My angle was I love her.\\
204 - Huh.\\
205 - Why does everybody go "huh"?\\
206 - What's with the "huh"?\\
207 - We always knew this day would come.\\
208 - What day?\\
209 - The day you stopped manipulating and conning women.\\
210 - The day you dropped your guard\\
211 - and let an honest emotion into your heart.\\
212 - Well, that's a good day, right?\\
213 - If you don't mind being some broad's prison bitch.\\
214 - What are you going to do now?\\
215 - I don't know.\\
216 - I can't keep seeing her, 'cause the relationship's\\
217 - completely out of balance,\\
218 - and I can't stop seeing her because I love her.\\
219 - I feel for you.\\
220 - I once loved a guy, didn't love me back.\\
221 - What did you do? 90 days in County.\\
222 - Plus anger management classes,\\
223 - which by the way, are a total freaking waste of time.\\
224 - (music playing on TV)\\
225 - Hey. Hey.\\
226 - Have you ever been in love?\\
227 - * Men. *\\
228 - Hey, Alan.\\
229 - ALAN Ocupado!\\
230 - I got it! I got it!\\
231 - I got it! I got it!\\
232 - I know how to restore\\
233 - the balance of power with Chelsea.\\
234 - Excuse me!\\
235 - What part of "ocupado" don't you understand?\\
236 - The "ocu" or the "pado"?\\
237 - I understood it all.\\
238 - I was just hoping you were shaving.\\
239 - Well, I'm not!\\
240 - And as you well know, this is an uphill battle for me,\\
241 - even in the best of circumstances.\\
242 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, but this is important.\\
243 - I'm going to get an "I love you" from Chelsea.\\
244 - If you let me finish,\\
245 - you'll get one from me.\\
246 - Check this out.\\
247 - Oh, Charlie, this is so sudden.\\
248 - If you wait a few minutes,\\
249 - I'll have a gift for you.\\
250 - I'm going to marry Chelsea.\\
251 - Are you serious?\\
252 - Serious enough to ignore\\
253 - what's going on right in front of me.\\
254 - Well, congratulations... I guess.\\
255 - Thank you.\\
256 - Let's see her not say "I love you" now.\\
257 - Let's see what marriage does to his bowels.\\
258 - * Men. *\\
259 - * Men. *\\
260 - How's your salmon?\\
261 - Delicious.\\
262 - And this is such a romantic restaurant.\\
263 - I'm glad you like it.\\
264 - Have you been here before?\\
265 - No.\\
266 - Yes.\\
267 - Well, a couple times.\\
268 - A lot.\\
269 - I know you've dated other women.\\
270 - Why would you lie?\\
271 - Survival instinct.\\
272 - Same reason I don't drink in the bathtub anymore.\\
273 - What else have you lied to me about?\\
274 - I don't know.\\
275 - What else haven't you believed?\\
276 - You're awful.\\
277 - Awful good, right?\\
278 - Yeah.\\
279 - Excuse me, I have to powder my nose.\\
280 - Okay, who's lying now?\\
281 - (quietly): Bobby.\\
282 - Is everything all right, Mr. Harper?\\
283 - Yeah, terrific. Listen, my date's in the ladies' room\\
284 - and I need you to do something for me.\\
285 - Not a problem.\\
286 - I'll have the valet bring your car around to the alley.\\
287 - I'll open the men's restroom window so you can shimmy out.\\
288 - And I'll have a cab standing by to take the lady home\\
289 - along with the customary chocolate souffl   to go.\\
290 - No, no, no, I'm not breaking up with her.\\
291 - I'm going to ask her to marry me.\\
292 - I think we need to get some coffee in you.\\
293 - I'm not drunk.\\
294 - I know exactly what I'm doing.\\
295 - As always.\\
296 - All I need you to do is bring a bottle of champagne,\\
297 - pour a glass for her and a glass for me,\\
298 - then distract her so I can slip the ring into her glass.\\
299 - Oh, how charmingly original.\\
300 - You've seen that before?\\
301 - Never.\\
302 - Here she comes.\\
303 - Go get the champagne.\\
304 - I'll keep the bathroom window open just in case.\\
305 - Charlie, there's something I want to talk to you about.\\
306 - Okay.\\
307 - The other day when you said you loved me,\\
308 - I didn't really respond.\\
309 - Yes, you did.\\
310 - You said, "Thank you."\\
311 - You were very courteous.\\
312 - It's not that I don't have\\
313 - strong feelings for you, it's just that\\
314 - taking that extra step is really hard for me.\\
315 - Well, don't worry about it.\\
316 - I'm sure you'll take that step when it's appropriate.\\
317 - Oh, look, champagne.\\
318 - Ooh, is it a special occasion?\\
319 - Every night with you is a special occasion.\\
320 - I'm going to miss you, sir.\\
321 - (mouthing words)\\
322 - Oh, dear.\\
323 - I hope I'm not having a massive coronary.\\
324 - Oh, my God, are you all right?\\
325 - I'm not sure.\\
326 - Yes, I'm fine.\\
327 - (sotto voce): The one waiter in L.A. who's not an actor.\\
328 - What?\\
329 - Nothing. Nothing.\\
330 - A toast.\\
331 - To saying what we feel.\\
332 - What the hell did I just swallow?\\
333 - A one-bedroom condo. What?\\
334 - I put a diamond ring in your champagne glass.\\
335 - Why?\\
336 - What do you mean "why?"\\
337 - I was going to propose and I had no idea you'd chug it\\
338 - like a Jell-O shot.\\
339 - That was a ring I just swallowed?\\
340 - Who drinks champagne like that?\\
341 - I was thirsty.\\
342 - Stop yelling at me!\\
343 - How in God's name could you swallow it so easily?\\
344 - Hey, that's one of the things you love about me!\\
345 - Problem?\\
346 - No problem. Go away.\\
347 - Car's outside, window's open.\\
348 - Let's go.\\
349 - Where?\\
350 - The emergency room. Why?\\
351 - Because I have a ring in my stomach!\\
352 - Oh, don't worry about that. You'll be fine.\\
353 - How do you know? When Jake was little,\\
354 - he swallowed a handful of nickels.\\
355 - Nothing bad happened.\\
356 - Are you sure?\\
357 - Absolutely.\\
358 - He still shoots one out every now and then.\\
359 - Bets me heads or tails.\\
360 - Just between you and me,\\
361 - I'm not even sure they're the same nickels.\\
362 - Trust me.\\
363 - A couple cups of coffee in the morning,\\
364 - problem solved.\\
365 - I suppose you're right.\\
366 - So, what do you say?\\
367 - What do I say about what?\\
368 - I asked you to marry me.\\
369 - No, you didn't.\\
370 - Well, I was about to until you ruined the moment.\\
371 - I ruined the moment?\\
372 - Okay. Okay, there's no sense in assigning blame.\\
373 - The point is, I'm proposing.\\
374 - You want to marry me.\\
375 - Yes. I love you.\\
376 - Oh... I don't know what to say.\\
377 - Say you love me and you'll marry me.\\
378 - Gee, Charlie, you're kind of putting me on the spot here.\\
379 - Yeah, well, that's kind of built into the whole proposal concept.\\
380 - Oh, come on, just say it so we can be even.\\
381 - "Even"?\\
382 - Is that what this is about?\\
383 - Some kind of power thing?\\
384 - N-no, no, no.\\
385 - I meant so that we could be even... closer.\\
386 - Right.\\
387 - Okay, that was lame.\\
388 - But don't blame me, blame my shrink.\\
389 - What? If I was properly medicated,\\
390 - we wouldn't be having this conversation.\\
391 - Boy, this keeps getting more and more romantic.\\
392 - Look, do you love me or not?\\
393 - I guess so.\\
394 - No guessing.\\
395 - That's not how the process works.\\
396 - All right, I love you.\\
397 - Oh, great! Great, good.\\
398 - That's all I wanted.\\
399 - But I won't marry you.\\
400 - What? Oh, yeah, right.\\
401 - That's okay, no biggie.\\
402 - I just got out of a marriage.\\
403 - I'm not ready to do it again.\\
404 - That's fine. I understand.\\
405 - I'm not saying "no,"\\
406 - I'm just saying "not now."\\
407 - Hey, "not now" is my favorite time for a wedding.\\
408 - The important thing is that we love each other.\\
409 - Right. Equally.\\
410 - Yes. Fifty-fifty.\\
411 - If it means that much to you.\\
412 - Come on, say it again.\\
413 - "I love you."\\
414 - No.\\
415 - Why not?\\
416 - I want to see the ring first.\\
417 - * Men. *\\
418 - Hey, Berta?\\
419 - Where do we keep the spaghetti strainer thingie?\\
420 - It's called a "colander."\\
421 - What do you need it for?\\
422 - It's not for me. It's for Chelsea.\\
423 - Okay, what kind of Martha Stewart freak show\\
424 - you got going up there?\\
425 - Trust me, you don't need the details.\\
426 - I don't want the details.\\
427 - I just need to know whether to wash it\\
428 - or throw it away when you're done.\\
429 - Oh, I think you'll want to throw it away.\\
430 - Morning. Hey, Alan.\\
431 - Congratulate me.\\
432 - I'm kind of engaged.\\
433 - So she said "yes"?\\
434 - Not exactly.\\
435 - You gave her the ring, right?\\
436 - Yep. Well, what did she say?\\
437 - (gagging)\\
438 - You had to be there.\\
439 - Okay.\\
440 - So, have you set a date?\\
441 - For what?\\
442 - The wedding.\\
443 - What wedding?\\
444 - Nobody's getting married. I'm just engaged.\\
445 - When do we get to see this rock?\\
446 - Well, Chelsea just finished her second cup of coffee,\\
447 - so I'd guess... 15, 20 minutes.\\
448 - Anybody understand what that was all about?\\
449 - I think Chelsea swallowed some nickels.\\
450 - * Men. *\\
451 - Chelsea?\\
452 - CHELSEA: Yeah?\\
453 - You've been in there for awhile.\\
454 - How's it going?\\
455 - Just fine.\\
456 - You need any help?\\
457 - I brought Alan's little poop stool.\\
458 - Go away!\\
459 - All right, all right.\\
460 - But just remember,\\
461 - when you hear a metallic clink, stop.\\
462 - I think I can handle it.\\
463 - I'm just saying, it's not on my homeowner's policy yet,\\
464 - so if you flush it by mistake, I'm screwed.\\
465 - Charlie, I swear\\
466 - if you don't walk away from that door,\\
467 - I will eat a block of cheese\\
468 - and you will never see that ring again!\\
469 - Okay, I'm walking. Good.\\
470 - Love you.\\
471 - Don't push it, Charlie!\\
472 - Right back at you.\\
473 - (clinking)\\
474 - Oh, Charlie, it's beautiful.

4 - Chelsea?\\
5 - (congested): Yeah?\\
6 - You okay?\\
7 - I think I'm coming down with a cold.\\
8 - (nose honking)\\
9 - That doesn't sound like a cold,\\
10 - it sounds like quitting time in Bedrock.\\
11 - Do I feel hot to you?\\
12 - Let me see.\\
13 - Stop it.\\
14 - You're supposed to feel my head.\\
15 - Yeah, but those babies are my frame of reference.\\
16 - (coughing)\\
17 - Maybe I should go home.\\
18 - Well, if you think that's the right thing to do.\\
19 - Charlie, it's the middle of the night and I'm sick.\\
20 - I'm not going home.\\
21 - Then why'd you say you were?\\
22 - I was testing you.\\
23 - Yeah, well, I knew that\\
24 - and I was testing you.\\
25 - I think we both did very well.\\
26 - (coughing)\\
27 - Tell you what,\\
28 - you get a good night's sleep.\\
29 - I'm sure you'll feel better in the morning.\\
30 - Where are you going?\\
31 - I'm gonna go crash on the couch,\\
32 - let you have the whole bed to yourself.\\
33 - Really? You're gonna leave me here alone?\\
34 - No, no, I just thought you might want your own space.\\
35 - You know, when dogs are sick,\\
36 - they hide till they feel better.\\
37 - Probably why they're man's best friend.\\
38 - Could you please stay?\\
39 - Pretty please?\\
40 - How can I say no?\\
41 - (under breath): Seriously, how?\\
42 - Spoon?\\
43 - Try and stop me.\\
44 - (coughing and clearing throat)\\
45 - So what, you're just gonna swallow that?\\
46 - Go to sleep.\\

64 - I am not gonna cry.\\
65 - Hey.\\
66 - What are you doing up?\\
67 - Watching a Clint Eastwood movie.\\
68 - What are you doing up?\\
69 - Chelsea's sick.\\
70 - She was coughing and sneezing all over the place.\\
71 - Oh, no. Yeah.\\
72 - I had to wait till she finally fell asleep\\
73 - so I could get the hell outta there\\
74 - without pissin' her off.\\
75 - How considerate.\\
76 - What do you want from me?\\
77 - I'm not a big phlegm fan.\\
78 - (movie plays indistinctly)\\
79 - This isn't a Clint Eastwood movie.\\
80 - Yes, it is.\\
81 - Even Clint Eastwood doesn't think\\
82 - this is a Clint Eastwood movie.\\
83 - Well, tough, I like it.\\
84 - Sure, you do.\\
85 - You're a giant fruit basket.\\
86 - I'll never apologize for my feminine side.\\
87 - Boy, I hope she gets better soon.\\
88 - This sick stuff is not what I signed on for.\\
89 - You're kidding, right?\\
90 - This is exactly what you signed on for.\\
91 - (broadcast stops)\\
92 - You told Chelsea you loved her,\\
93 - you gave her an engagement ring.\\
94 - This is what it's all about.\\
95 - Being there for her, no matter what.\\
96 - For richer or poorer, better or worse,\\
97 - in sickness and in health.\\
98 - Call me crazy, but I prefer richer,\\
99 - better and health.\\
100 - Well, regardless, this could be a real opportunity for you.\\
101 - Opportunity for what, a massive infection?\\
102 - An opportunity to show her that she can depend on you.\\
103 - That you're not just there for the good times.\\
104 - Okay, I hear that.\\
105 - But tell me one thing.\\
106 - Yeah?\\
107 - What's in it for me?\\
108 - Watch Clint and Meryl.\\
109 - (broadcast resumes)\\
110 - Learn how to love.\\

115 - You awake?\\
116 - (sighs)\\
117 - Boy, I hope not.\\
118 - I feel awful.\\
119 - Really?\\
120 - You look swell.\\
121 - I should go home.\\
122 - No, no, no, no.\\
123 - I am not falling for that again.\\
124 - You stay right here, let me take care of you.\\
125 - You mean it?\\

129 - Yes, please.\\
130 - Comin' up.\\
131 - With honey?\\
132 - Sure.\\
133 - And maybe an English muffin.\\
134 - No problem.\\
135 - Toasted crispy.\\
136 - Right.\\
137 - And let the butter melt into all the nooks and crannies\\
138 - before you put the jam on.\\
139 - Anything else?\\
140 - Can I have a hug?\\
141 - Try and stop me.\\
142 - Nice necklace.\\
143 - Thanks.\\
144 - Buy it for yourself?\\
145 - No, a girl gave it to me.\\
146 - Really?\\
147 - She must like you.\\
148 - Yeah, she's nuts for me.\\
149 - Well, is she cute?\\
150 - I guess.\\
151 - You, uh, you don't seem very happy about it.\\
152 - I'm not.\\
153 - Why? What's the problem?\\
154 - She's nine.\\
155 - Nine?\\
156 - Where would you meet a nine-year-old girl?\\
157 - We're in the same math class.\\
158 - Is, uh, is she one of those advanced students?\\
159 - Sadly, no.\\
160 - But she does help me with my homework.\\
161 - Hey, Berta, Chelsea's not feeling well.\\
162 - Could you make her some tea and an English muffin?\\
163 - Sure, I could.\\
164 - But you won't.\\
165 - Is that what you're saying?\\
166 - Where are the muffins?\\
167 - In the fridge.\\
168 - As always.\\
169 - Don't condescend to me.\\
170 - He does it to me all the time.\\
171 - It's very irritating.\\
172 - No one's talking to you.\\
173 - See? Like that.\\
174 - That wasn't condescending.\\
175 - But that was, right?\\
176 - Right...\\
177 - Boy, as soon as I get my license, I am so outta here.\\
178 - Sure. You can drive your girlfriend to Gymboree.\\
179 - At least I have a girlfriend.\\
180 - (mocking): At least I have a girlfriend.\\
181 - So what's the deal?\\
182 - Does, uh, Chelsea have a cold?\\
183 - I'm not sure.\\
184 - Cold, flu, something disgusting.\\
185 - Maybe she has an STD.\\
186 - What?\\
187 - It means "sexually transmitted disease."\\
188 - I know what STD's are.\\
189 - Your uncle helped invent them.\\
190 - You know, they can be prevented by using a condom.\\
191 - I know we could've prevented you by using a condom.\\
192 - Now we gotta use a hammer.\\
193 - I don't understand.\\
194 - Go get me a hammer, and I'll show you.\\
195 - Okay.\\
196 - You must be so proud.\\
197 - JAKE: Ball peen\\
198 - or claw hammer?\\
199 - Do me a favor,\\
200 - when he comes back, just do it.\\
201 - * Men. *\\
202 - Okay, here we go.\\
203 - Room service.\\
204 - Chelsea?\\
205 - Honey?\\
206 - CHELSEA (congested): Don't come in.\\
207 - Wasn't even tempted.\\
208 - I got your tea and muffins.\\
209 - I have diarrhea.\\
210 - I can't eat now.\\
211 - I may never eat again.\\
212 - Would you mind going to the drugstore for me?\\
213 - For you, I'd go to the ends of the earth.\\
214 - (under breath): Coming back's a whole other question.\\
215 - What?\\
216 - I said, "What do you need?"\\
217 - Well, I need Pepto,\\
218 - and we're almost out of tissues,\\
219 - and I need some decongestant,\\
220 - some cough syrup,\\
221 - something for canker sores, and wet wipes.\\
222 - For your hands?\\
223 - No. Got it.\\
224 - And I'm probably gonna need some tampons.\\
225 - (under breath): Oh, great.\\
226 - There's gonna be blood, too.\\
227 - You're really being wonderful\\
228 - about all this, Charlie.\\
229 - Oh, it's nothing.\\
230 - It's what a guy does when he loves somebody.\\
231 - Should've known.\\
232 - The second you give 'em a ring, they fall out of warranty.\\
233 - * Men. *\\
234 - * Men. *\\
235 - Hey, Russell? Mm-hmm?\\
236 - What's good for canker sores?\\
237 - You got canker sores?\\
238 - No, my girlfriend.\\
239 - What do you recommend?\\
240 - Tennis shoes.\\
241 - Excuse me?\\
242 - Put 'em on and run away.\\
243 - There's a lot of broads out there.\\
244 - Find a clean one.\\
245 - I-I can't run away.\\
246 - I'm kind of engaged to her.\\
247 - Oh, Charlie, no.\\
248 - Yup. I bit the bullet.\\
249 - You bit the big one.\\
250 - Hey, just because you blew three marriages doesn't mean\\
251 - I can't make this work.\\
252 - (laughs)\\
253 - You're a funny guy, Charlie.\\
254 - And that's not just the Oxycontin talking.\\
255 - Here you go.\\
256 - Cank-B-Gone.\\
257 - What else?\\
258 - Uh, let's see.\\
259 - Cough syrup.\\
260 - Regular or codeine?\\
261 - Don't you need a prescription for codeine?\\
262 - What are you, a cop?\\
263 - Here.\\
264 - I'll give you the kid stuff.\\
265 - What else?\\
266 - Uh, tissues, throat lozenges,\\
267 - decongestant, Pepto, wet wipes.\\
268 - Geez, where'd you find this one?\\
269 - A hospital parking lot?\\
270 - Come on, Russell, help me out.\\
271 - Okay. Okay, here you go.\\
272 - A dam for every river.\\
273 - A plug for every jug.\\
274 - Oh, right, I almost forgot.\\
275 - She also needs tampons.\\
276 - Oh, lucky you.\\
277 - (laughing)\\
278 - What size?\\
279 - How should I know?\\
280 - Is there some kind\\
281 - of a condom-tampon conversion chart?\\
282 - No, but that's an amusing idea.\\
283 - Actually, it's not about size, per se.\\
284 - It's more about flow.\\
285 - Okay, see, that's a piece of information\\
286 - I could have gone the rest of my life without knowing.\\
287 - Here you go.\\
288 - Here's a variety pack.\\
289 - This'll handle anything\\
290 - from a little drizzle to a monsoon.\\
291 - Listen, is it too late to change my mind about the codeine?\\
292 - The first one's free.\\
293 - * Men. *\\
294 - (coughing)\\
295 - Okay, got all your stuff.\\
296 - Took you long enough. Whoa!\\
297 - Whoa! I just went shopping for wet wipes and tampons.\\
298 - I'm allowed to take my time.\\
299 - I'm sorry. Are you mad at me?\\
300 - No. No.\\
301 - Why would I be mad at you?\\
302 - 'Cause I'm sick, and you have to take care of me.\\
303 - Are you kidding me?\\
304 - I love taking care of you.\\
305 - I just... love...\\
306 - ...it.\\
307 - Yeah, I can see that.\\
308 - Listen, could you go over to my place\\
309 - and get me some clean clothes and feed Sir Lancelot?\\
310 - Who?\\
311 - My cat.\\
312 - He's not gonna feed himself, Charlie.\\
313 - Are you sure?\\
314 - Maybe you've got mice.\\
315 - And you're probably gonna have to change the litter box, too.\\
316 - Change it into what?\\
317 - You got to scoop out the poop and put in fresh litter.\\
318 - Oh, this just keeps getting better and better.\\
319 - Charlie?\\
320 - Yeah?\\
321 - I love you.\\
322 - Great.\\
323 - Aren't you gonna say it back?\\
324 - I'm gonna go pan for cat turds.\\
325 - If that doesn't say "I love you,"\\
326 - nothing does.\\
327 - I promise, I'm wearing it.\\
328 - Wait a sec.\\
329 - Okay, I sent you a picture.\\
330 - Now what's the answer to number four?\\
331 - Oh, yeah. That's what I had.\\
332 - What you doing, Alan?\\
333 - My taxes. I promised myself\\
334 - I wouldn't wait till the last minute this year.\\
335 - Yeah, and you promised me you'd only stay here\\
336 - for a few days, so your word means nothing.\\
337 - Come on, you're driving me to Chelsea's.\\
338 - Why don't you drive yourself?\\
339 - Because I just chugged\\
340 - a half a bottle of codeine,\\
341 - and this bourbon might make me a bit of a threat on the road.\\
342 - Ah, good call.\\
343 - * Men. *\\
344 - Here, kitty, kitty.\\
345 - Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.\\
346 - Okay, I got her clean clothes.\\
347 - Great.\\
348 - Now I just got to feed the damn cat.\\
349 - Come on, Sir Lancelot.\\
350 - Come out and eat your kibble.\\
351 - (cat yowling)\\
352 - Oh!\\
353 - Son of a bitch!\\
354 - I'm pretty sure if you just put the food out,\\
355 - he'll find it and eat it when he's hungry.\\
356 - Really? You'd think if he was that smart,\\
357 - he'd just crap in the toilet instead of a litter box.\\
358 - Oh, uh, did you change the litter yet?\\
359 - No. I was actually gonna offer you $20 to do it.\\
360 - I'll take it.\\
361 - Deal...\\
362 - Ha, ha. I would have done it for ten.\\
363 - Ha, ha. I would have given you a thousand.\\
364 - Whoa. Big cat.\\
365 - You know what I just realized, Alan?\\
366 - Cough syrup and hard liquor don't mix?\\
367 - No, they're delightful.\\
368 - I'm thinking that sooner or later,\\
369 - Chelsea's gonna want to move in with me.\\
370 - Yeah, if you marry her, that's a chance you take.\\
371 - And she's probably gonna want to bring Sir Craps-a-lot.\\
372 - You never know.\\
373 - He might want to get his own place.\\
374 - I'm guessing he will before you will.\\
375 - Oh, Lord.\\
376 - This cat's been eating more than kibble.\\
377 - This turd's got feathers.\\
378 - You know, there's a real chance that someday,\\
379 - without any kind of warning whatsoever,\\
380 - Chelsea will up and decide to get sick again.\\
381 - And we're on the air with codeine and bourbon.\\
382 - Go ahead, caller.\\
383 - I'm just saying, I don't think I can go through it again.\\
384 - I'm not cut out to be a caregiver.\\
385 - Well, you might not think so, but you're doing it.\\
386 - I mean, you, Charlie Harper, are unselfishly taking care\\
387 - of the woman you love.\\
388 - Maybe so, but...\\
389 - it's getting harder and harder to love her.\\
390 - You don't mean that.\\
391 - Oh, Alan,\\
392 - if you'd seen and heard the things I have\\
393 - in the last 24 hours, it'd turn you gayer than a French horn.\\
394 - Excuse me, but I have witnessed childbirth.\\
395 - I saw my son's enormous head poke out\\
396 - of what used to be one of my very favorite places.\\
397 - Thanks for the image.\\
398 - I'll never be able to watch the kid pull on a sweater again.\\
399 - Trust me. If you hang in there and show Chelsea\\
400 - that you'll stick by her even when she's not at her best,\\
401 - she will love you more deeply and intensely\\
402 - than you ever could have imagined.\\
403 - And you know this how?\\
404 - How else? Chick flicks.\\
405 - Oh.\\
406 - This is not a kitty cat.\\
407 - This is a mountain lion.\\
408 - Look.\\
409 - Hey, hey, hey, hey!\\
410 - * Men. *\\
411 - You need some more orange juice?\\
412 - No, thank you.\\
413 - It was so nice of you\\
414 - to bring some up without me even asking.\\
415 - Don't tell Charlie.\\
416 - It's taken a long time\\
417 - to train him not to expect anything from me.\\
418 - Yeah.\\
419 - He really is crazy about you, you know.\\
420 - You think?\\
421 - Are you kidding?\\
422 - Charlie doesn't go near sick women.\\
423 - I mean, physically sick.\\
424 - Around here, one sneeze will get you cab fare\\
425 - and a complimentary travel mug.\\
426 - I have noticed he's trying very hard.\\
427 - Just remember, when it comes to nurturing,\\
428 - Charlie's like a dog playing the piano.\\
429 - You can't fault him if he hits a few bum notes.\\
430 - You just got to applaud\\
431 - the effort and hope he doesn't whiz all over the keys.\\
432 - I understand.\\
433 - Thanks, Berta.\\
434 - Just so we're clear, this ain't no hotel.\\
435 - You need more towels, you get 'em yourself.\\
436 - Sorry about that.\\
437 - You really can't expect much from her.\\
438 - I won't.\\
439 - Here. I got you clean clothes and underwear.\\
440 - The cat's fed,\\
441 - and the litter box is turd free.\\
442 - Thank you, Charlie.\\
443 - You have been so wonderful through all of this.\\
444 - I have, haven't I?\\
445 - I just want you to know\\
446 - I am definitely gonna make it up to you.\\
447 - Chelsea, to be honest,\\
448 - that's the only thing that's kept me going.\\
449 - Uh-oh.\\
450 - Uh-oh, what?\\
451 - (retching) (splattering)\\
452 - Oh, Charlie, I'm so sorry.\\
453 - No, no, it's okay.\\
454 - At least it's not wicker.\\
455 - Excuse me a sec.\\
456 - (loud retching and splattering)\\
457 - * Men. *\\
458 - (coughing)\\
459 - (loud nose blowing)\\
460 - (coughing)\\
461 - Okay, I am going to go to the pharmacy\\
462 - and get your medicine.\\
463 - If you get it from Russell,\\
464 - count the pills.\\
465 - Will do.\\
466 - Hope you feel better.\\
467 - Thanks.\\
468 - Charlie, you don't mind Sir Lancelot being here, do you?\\
469 - No, not at all.\\
470 - I love cats.\\
471 - Good.\\
472 - (coughing)\\
473 - (door closes)\\
474 - (scratching at door)\\
475 - Don't scratch the door, Sir Lancelot!\\
476 - Did you clean my litter box?\\
477 - Oh, come on. I've been sick.\\
478 - Fine. I'll just use your facilities.\\
479 - Not in the tub this time, okay?\\
480 - Your house, your rules.\\
481 - (panting)\\
482 - (sighs)\\
483 - I'm not gonna make it.\\
484 - (coughing)\\
485 - Yes, you are.
\subsection {Episode 19: The Two Finger Rule}
1 - How long are you gonna keep punishing me for this?\\
2 - Okay, okay, uh, once again,\\
3 - uh, I did not technically have sex with your mother.\\
4 - You want to catch me up?\\
5 - ALAN: Melissa, are you gonna let me talk?\\
6 - Well, you know Alan was nailing his receptionist, right? Yeah.\\
7 - Apparently, she caught him in bed with her mother.\\
8 - Are you gonna let me talk?\\
9 - What do you know?\\
10 - I've been calling him that for years,\\
11 - and now he's up and done it.\\
12 - I-I was not responsible for my actions.\\
13 - I was stoned out of my mind.\\
14 - You know, that excuse has never once worked for me.\\
15 - Me, either.\\
16 - Cops or boyfriends.\\
17 - No. Hey, hey, hey,\\
18 - your mother put enough pot in that banana bread\\
19 - to treat every case of glaucoma in the San Fernando Valley.\\
20 - I have a recipe for macaroons.\\
21 - Very similar.\\
22 - I was so high, I didn't even know who she was.\\
23 - We were just colors.\\
24 - I was red, she was blue.\\
25 - We were trying to make purple.\\
26 - Honey, my phone's dead. Can I borrow your cell?\\
27 - Sure. It's on the coffee table.\\
28 - Thanks.\\
29 - Okay, so-so bottom line,\\
30 - I was drugged and molested by your mother,\\
31 - and I'm the bad guy?\\
32 - Man, how many times have I heard you make this phone call?\\
33 - Yeah, who'd have thought, of the two of us, I'd be the one\\
34 - to end up in a healthy, stable relationship?\\
35 - Who is Rachel,\\
36 - and why is she sending you topless photos?\\
37 - Um...\\
38 - Yeah, who'd have thought?\\
39 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
40 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
41 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
42 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
43 - * Men.\\
44 - You want to explain to me\\
45 - why this woman is sending you naked pictures of herself?\\
46 - I'd love to explain it.\\
47 - Go ahead.\\
48 - I said I'd love to.\\
49 - I didn't say I could.\\
50 - Are you sleeping with her?\\
51 - No, no, of course not.\\
52 - Then why the pictures?\\
53 - Uh, well,\\
54 - my-my-my-my... my best guess would be\\
55 - that, like a lot of girls,\\
56 - she wanted to show off her new boob job.\\
57 - That's your best guess?\\
58 - Well, you wouldn't understand\\
59 - because clearly, God has blessed you\\
60 - with this great bounty.\\
61 - Damn it, Charlie, I want to know...\\
62 - Excuse me. I am on the phone.\\
63 - (whispering): Shh. Alan's on the phone.\\
64 - Don't shush me.\\
65 - Who is this Rachel?\\
66 - Nobody really.\\
67 - I used to go out with her way, way before you and I met\\
68 - and I fell so deeply in love.\\
69 - Head-over-heels in love.\\
70 - Puppy dog love. Woof!\\
71 - Hang on, Melissa.\\
72 - I couldn't hear anything after "You son of a bitch."\\
73 - Does this Rachel know you're engaged?\\
74 - Um...\\
75 - Think long and hard\\
76 - before you start lying to me.\\
77 - I was. That's why I said, "Um..."\\
78 - Charlie...\\
79 - She doesn't know. Why not?\\
80 - Boy, you're gonna keep this flapjack\\
81 - on the griddle, aren't you?\\
82 - (laughing)\\
83 - Berta, would you give us a minute?\\
84 - Oh, you're gonna need more than a minute.\\
85 - So long.\\
86 - I'm gonna miss you.\\
87 - What are you talking about?\\
88 - She's not going anywhere.\\
89 - Are you? Where-where you going? Chelsea?\\
90 - Chelsea, wait.\\
91 - Can't we just put this behind us?\\
92 - I-I swear I'll never make out with your mother again.\\
93 - Let's face it, Charlie.\\
94 - We both knew you were gonna blow it eventually.\\
95 - I didn't. I had my suspicions, but I wasn't sure.\\
96 - I wish I could say the same. Good-bye.\\
97 - Oh, please don't leave.\\
98 - Oh, please don't hang up.\\
99 - CHARLIE & ALAN: I love you!\\
100 - And I love you, too.\\
101 - * Men.\\
102 - Sure you don't want a drink?\\
103 - No.\\
104 - When I'm depressed, alcohol just makes me feel worse.\\
105 - Yeah, see, the trick is to drink past that.\\
106 - Not a sprint, it's a marathon.\\
107 - You ever think we're both doomed to grow old alone and unloved?\\
108 - A couple of pathetic bachelors\\
109 - with no one to talk to but each other?\\
110 - You ought to do ads for this stuff.\\
111 - So, are you gonna tell me what happened with Chelsea?\\
112 - I can show you.\\
113 - Chelsea found this on my phone.\\
114 - I ask you,\\
115 - is that worth breaking an engagement?\\
116 - Oh!\\
117 - It's worth breaking a spine.\\
118 - Were you sleeping with this girl?\\
119 - No. No.\\
120 - She just sent me a few pictures.\\
121 - Oh. Well, then, why'd you keep 'em?\\
122 - All right, all right, all right.\\
123 - But you got to understand the-the message\\
124 - that this sends to Chelsea.\\
125 - Other than, you know,\\
126 - "Got milk?"\\
127 - But I'm not cheating.\\
128 - There are other forms of cheating.\\
129 - There's, uh... there's, uh, flirting.\\
130 - There's fantasizing about other women...\\
131 - Oh, come on.\\
132 - Fantasizing is not cheating.\\
133 - To women it is.\\
134 - They-they don't like the idea that\\
135 - you're mentally replacing them with someone else.\\
136 - What if I'm mentally supplementing them\\
137 - with someone else?\\
138 - You know,\\
139 - like I'm making love to Chelsea,\\
140 - and in my mind, Rachel here is just helping out.\\
141 - (moaning)\\
142 - She does look very helpful.\\
143 - Nevertheless, I-I can understand\\
144 - why Chelsea would take a dimmer view.\\
145 - Yeah, well, I think she overreacted.\\
146 - In fact, I think she owes me an apology.\\
147 - Really? So, you're just gonna sit here\\
148 - and wait till she comes crawling back,\\
149 - are you? Yes, I am.\\
150 - And then, because hell will long since have frozen over,\\
151 - we can go ice-skating.\\
152 - It's good that you have a plan.\\
153 - Now if you will pardon me,\\
154 - I have to go pick up Jake at his mother's.\\
155 - Oh, good.\\
156 - Just what we need to brighten up our weekend.\\
157 - A large, sullen teenager\\
158 - with gas and questionable hygiene.\\
159 - There's nothing questionable about it.\\
160 - (sighs)\\
161 - There we go.\\
162 - (breathes in through teeth)\\
163 - Over the hump.\\
164 - * Men.\\
165 - JUDITH: She's my mother, Herb!\\
166 - I want her here when I have the baby!\\
167 - HERB: Yeah, well, I don't need yet another woman in this house\\
168 - yelling at me, calling me an idiot!\\
169 - JUDITH: My mother doesn't yell, you idiot!\\
170 - HERB: Okay, I'm gonna let that pass because you're pregnant!\\
171 - JUDITH: Don't you dare blame this on hormones!\\
172 - HERB: What's my alternative, Judith?!\\
173 - Accept the fact that I'm an idiot?!\\
174 - (sighs)\\
175 - Oh, hey, Alan.\\
176 - Is this a bad time?\\
177 - They're all bad.\\
178 - Seven-and-a-half months of bad.\\
179 - Don't you walk away from me.\\
180 - Well, I'm sorry. I was answering the door!\\
181 - That's what we idiots do when we hear a doorbell.\\
182 - Hi, Dad. Bye, Mom.\\
183 - Good luck, Herb.\\
184 - Bye, Jake.\\
185 - Wish I was going with you.\\
186 - I knew it as soon as it came out of my mouth.\\
187 - * Men.\\
188 - (sighs)\\
189 - I could get used to this.\\
190 - Don't.\\
191 - As far as Charlie is concerned, mi casa es mi casa.\\
192 - All right, I've ordered your pizza.\\
193 - I'm going home.\\
194 - Thanks, Berta.\\
195 - Ordering a pizza and going home--\\
196 - two of the three things you want in a woman.\\
197 - And you wonder why Chelsea dumped you.\\
198 - I'll tell you what I wonder.\\
199 - I wonder how you could possibly get stoned enough\\
200 - to stick your tongue\\
201 - in the mouth of a 60-year-old woman.\\
202 - Zing!\\
203 - Boy, I just love this male bonding.\\
204 - Giving each other the old business.\\
205 - The old business?\\
206 - Yeah, you know, the needle,\\
207 - the zetz, the razzmatazz.\\
208 - Herb, I got to ask you something.\\
209 - Are there any other guys you hang out with?\\
210 - Oh, sure, I have my peeps.\\
211 - There's my, uh, water polo league,\\
212 - the guys down at the model train shop.\\
213 - Oh, and my, uh, barbershop quartet.\\
214 - Although I can't have them over to the house anymore.\\
215 - Why not?\\
216 - Four part harmony\\
217 - triggers Judith's migraines.\\
218 - Plus, mustaches creep her out.\\
219 - Oh, not just mustaches.\\
220 - Any facial hair whatsoever.\\
221 - Except eyebrows.\\
222 - Neatly trimmed.\\
223 - Right. The two finger rule.\\
224 - Mm.\\
225 - Huh. Chelsea had a two finger rule.\\
226 - Nothing to do with eyebrows, though.\\
227 - All right, I'll see you later.\\
228 - Where are you going?\\
229 - Down to the pier with Celeste. Who's Celeste?\\
230 - My girlfriend. She lives next door.\\
231 - Is she pretty?\\
232 - She's gorgeous\\
233 - and smart and popular.\\
234 - No kidding?\\
235 - We don't get it, either.\\
236 - Maybe she's punishing her father.\\
237 - Let's hope so.\\
238 - You know, I'm just the stepdad here,\\
239 - but, uh, shouldn't you tell him what time to be home?\\
240 - I don't have to.\\
241 - I know her father.\\
242 - Hey, Jake.\\
243 - Hello, sir.\\
244 - Celeste, Jake's here!\\
245 - So how have you been?\\
246 - We're walking down to the pier,\\
247 - we're gonna play skeeball, we'll be back by 11:00.\\
248 - You're damn right you will.\\
249 - * Men.\\
250 - * Men.\\
251 - Come on.\\
252 - It's freezing out here.\\
253 - Shouldn't we put out the cigars?\\
254 - Why?\\
255 - Uh... 'cause we're not allowed to smoke in the house?\\
256 - It's my house.\\
257 - We can smoke cigars, we can smoke salmon,\\
258 - whatever we want.\\
259 - Are you sure?\\
260 - Relax.\\
261 - No whiny broad is going to nag at you.\\
262 - Uh, Herb, make sure you use an ashtray and a coaster.\\
263 - I stand corrected.\\
264 - Zing!\\
265 - Hotcha!\\
266 - (doorbell ringing)\\
267 - Oh, this is going to be a long night.\\
268 - Hi, Charlie.\\
269 - Oh, God.\\
270 - What did the little knucklehead do?\\
271 - Nothing-- Jake said you guys were hanging out,\\
272 - and I thought you might want some company. Sure, come on in.\\
273 - I baked snickerdoodles if you're hungry.\\
274 - (chuckling)\\
275 - You baked snickerdoodles?\\
276 - Yeah-- why is that funny?\\
277 - It's not.\\
278 - You know Alan,\\
279 - and this is Herb.\\
280 - Hi. Hi.\\
281 - Make yourself comfortable.\\
282 - Can I get you something to drink?\\
283 - I wouldn't say no to an apple-tini.\\
284 - An apple-tini?\\
285 - My brother drinks apple-tinis.\\
286 - Why is that funny?\\
287 - It's not.\\
288 - One apple-tini coming up.\\
289 - He can get away with it; you can't.\\
290 - So, how do you know Charlie and Alan?\\
291 - Oh, I'm married to Alan's ex-wife.\\
292 - No kidding.\\
293 - And you hang out?\\
294 - Yeah. Sure.\\
295 - Wow.\\
296 - I couldn't be friends\\
297 - with the man who's putting it to my ex.\\
298 - Well, to be fair, there hasn't been a lot of putting lately.\\
299 - And after the baby's born, there will be even less.\\
300 - How is that possible?\\
301 - Not only will she not let you touch her,\\
302 - she'll interrupt you while you're touching yourself.\\
303 - Aw.\\
304 - I had to start showering at the Y.\\
305 - (groans)\\
306 - Okay, one apple-tini.\\
307 - Thank you.\\
308 - What are you guys talking about?\\
309 - Masturbating at the YMCA.\\
310 - Really?\\
311 - Just talk, right?\\
312 - Yeah, but the night is young.\\
313 - So, Jerome...\\
314 - solve one of the great mysteries of life for us.\\
315 - What does your daughter see in Jake?\\
316 - You know, I've been asking myself the same thing.\\
317 - Maybe she's punishing me.\\
318 - No offense.\\
319 - None taken.\\
320 - We're way ahead of you.\\
321 - You know, my wife and I are having a girl.\\
322 - Any advice?\\
323 - Yeah.\\
324 - Before your daughter starts dating,\\
325 - um, bulk up.\\
326 - Okay.\\
327 - Boy.\\
328 - Remember when we first started dating?\\
329 - Yep, eighth grade.\\
330 - Louise Miller.\\
331 - Oh, ninth grade.\\
332 - Maxine Chernakoff.\\
333 - Sixth grade, Mrs. Terapotta.\\
334 - Wasn't actually a date.\\
335 - Nowadays, she'd probably go to jail.\\
336 - So, uh, what about you, Herb?\\
337 - What about me, what?\\
338 - Uh, your first date.\\
339 - Uh, junior high, high school?\\
340 - College, freshman year.\\
341 - I was kind of a geek in high school.\\
342 - Hard to believe.\\
343 - No, really.\\
344 - They called me Big Bird.\\
345 - So, what happened in college?\\
346 - I stopped wearing yellow shirts and lowered my standards.\\
347 - Okay, okay.\\
348 - Here's one.\\
349 - First sexual experience\\
350 - that was not traditional intercourse.\\
351 - What are we talking about here?\\
352 - You know what I'm talking about.\\
353 - Boy Scouts?\\
354 - What?\\
355 - Oh.\\
356 - Zing!\\
357 - Alan. Hmm?\\
358 - When did you first take your oral exams?\\
359 - Oh, I... I-I don't think I should say.\\
360 - Why not? I just don't.\\
361 - Come on, Alan, we're all friends. Who was it?\\
362 - Your wife.\\
363 - So, your first time doing that was with Judith?\\
364 - Hey, me, too.\\
365 - Me, too.\\
366 - Just kidding-- zing, zing!\\
367 - (clears throat)\\
368 - What is "zing"?\\
369 - Is that some type of white guy slang?\\
370 - Quite possibly.\\
371 - My barbershop quartet does a killer version\\
372 - of "Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart".\\
373 - Real showstopper.\\
374 - Kind of like that story.\\
375 - Zing!\\
376 - Did I get that one right?\\
377 - (doorbell ringing)\\
378 - Oh, good.\\
379 - Finally.\\
380 - Hookers? Pizza.\\
381 - Oh.\\
382 - That's nice, too.\\
383 - Hey, Mr. Harper.\\
384 - Oh, hey, Gordon.\\
385 - It's been a long time.\\
386 - Yeah, two years.\\
387 - So, what you been up to?\\
388 - Well, I, uh... I finished night school,\\
389 - got my business degree,\\
390 - met an amazing girl and got married,\\
391 - landed a great job as a stockbroker.\\
392 - The company went under, my wife left me, and, uh...\\
393 - that'll be $28.50.\\
394 - Oh, man, I'm sorry.\\
395 - You want a drink?\\
396 - Why stop now?\\
397 - Come on in.\\
398 - Hey, everybody.\\
399 - This is Gordon.\\
400 - His wife left him.\\
401 - ALL: Hi, Gordon.\\
402 - Welcome to the losers lounge.\\
403 - Glad to be here.\\
404 - The topic of discussion\\
405 - is first nontraditional sexual experience.\\
406 - Bible camp.\\
407 - Where do you guys want me to put these?\\
408 - Oh, uh, here, let me move the snickerdoodles.\\
409 - (sighs) Snickerdoodles.\\
410 - You don't like them?\\
411 - No, no, I do.\\
412 - It's just that my wife used to call me\\
413 - her little snickerdoodle.\\
414 - You're kidding.\\
415 - Well, no, not all of me.\\
416 - It was her little nickname for my, uh...\\
417 - (chuckles awkwardly)\\
418 - Oh, that is a terrible name for a penis.\\
419 - Oh, yeah? What did your wife call yours?\\
420 - Mr. Roundtree.\\
421 - Richard Roundtree.\\
422 - The guy who played Shaft.\\
423 - ALL: Oh, yes.\\
424 - That's way better than Snickerdoodle.\\
425 - Judith calls mine "that thing".\\
426 - As in, "Get that thing away from me"?\\
427 - Yeah, how did you know?\\
428 - Just a guess.\\
429 - Okay.\\
430 - I'm out of here.\\
431 - Where you going?\\
432 - Someplace where I'm not knee-deep\\
433 - in pathetic, penis-naming sad sacks.\\
434 - No offense.\\
435 - ALL: None taken.\\
436 - Let's go, King Snake.\\
437 - * Men.\\
438 - What do you want?\\
439 - Just listen.\\
440 - Rachel?\\
441 - Hey, it's Charlie.\\
442 - Look, about the pictures you sent me...\\
443 - No, no, no, they were very nice.\\
444 - Yeah, real artsy.\\
445 - But the thing is, I'm kind of engaged now.\\
446 - I am definitely engaged now,\\
447 - so you shouldn't send me any more.\\
448 - (quietly): It doesn't matter who asked for them.\\
449 - The point is, I am no longer interested\\
450 - in anyone's boobs other than my fianc  e's.\\
451 - No, I'm not going to send you a picture of hers.\\
452 - Right?\\
453 - No.\\
454 - Okay, take care.\\
455 - Thank you, Charlie.\\
456 - I just want you to know how much you mean to me.\\
457 - Did you delete the pictures?\\
458 - Um...\\
459 - I guess there's a case to be made for that.\\
460 - What are you doing?\\
461 - Press delete.\\
462 - Hang on.\\
463 - I'm printing them in my memory.\\
464 - Delete, delete, delete.\\
465 - Look, I'm deleting!\\
466 - * Men.\\
467 - * Zing! Dear, when you smiled at me *\\
468 - * Zing! I heard a melody\\
469 - * Zing! It haunted me from the start *\\
470 - * The start\\
471 - * Zing! Something inside of me\\
472 - * Zing! Started a symphony\\
473 - * Zing! Went the strings of my heart *\\
474 - * Zing! 'Twas like a breath of spring *\\
475 - * Zing! I heard a robin sing\\
476 - * Zing! About a nest set apart\\
477 - No wonder they're all alone.\\
478 - * Zing! All nature seemed to me *\\
479 - * Zing! In perfect harmony\\
480 - * Zing! Went the strings of my heart... *\\
481 - * Who is the man\\
482 - * That will risk his neck for brother man? *\\
483 - * Shaft!\\
484 - JEROME: * Right on\\
485 - I heard this cat, Shaft,\\
486 - is one bad mother... Shut your mouth.\\
487 - Well, I'm talking about Shaft.\\
488 - Then, we can dig it.\\
489 - * He's a complicated man...\\
490 - No.\\
491 - I can't do this.\\
492 - She has to take me back.\\
493 - (in four-part harmony): * Men.
\subsection {Episode 20: Hello, I Am Alan Cousteau}
1 - Aren't you going to wash your hands before you eat?\\
2 - No. I wrap the toilet paper\\
3 - around my fingers like an oven mitt.\\
4 - You could catch a puck with it.\\
5 - So, Mom, what brings you to our neck of the woods?\\
6 - I'm showing a house down at the beach.\\
7 - Thought I'd swing by and see my grandson.\\
8 - Tada!\\
9 - Nice house?\\
10 - Oh, magnificent.\\
11 - And priced to move.\\
12 - The owner lost everything in the stock market, killed himself.\\
13 - Oh, that's terrible. Oh, no. He didn't do it in the house. Thank God.\\
14 - Even with an ocean view,\\
15 - suicide homes are a bitch to unload.\\
16 - Keep that in mind\\
17 - in case you ever want to teach your brother a lesson.\\
18 - Thanks for the tip.\\
19 - Good morning, Alan.\\
20 - Morning, Jake.\\
21 - Satan.\\
22 - Good morning, darling.\\
23 - Two coffee cups?\\
24 - Did you have a friend spend the night?\\
25 - Yes, I did.\\
26 - Couldn't get her to stand on the trapdoor, huh?\\
27 - Charlie, I don't have time for coffee, so...\\
28 - Oh, hello.\\
29 - Hello.\\
30 - Uh, Chelsea, this is my mother.\\
31 - Mom, this is Chelsea.\\
32 - Nice to meet you.\\
33 - Nice to meet you, too.\\
34 - Welcome back to the States.\\
35 - Thank you.\\
36 - Where have I been?\\
37 - Charlie says you have a place in Italy and...\\
38 - You know, Chelsea, sometimes when I'm drunk,\\
39 - I make up stories, so...\\
40 - You know, grain of salt.\\
41 - That is quite an engagement ring.\\
42 - Thank you.\\
43 - Does your fianc   know about this one?\\
44 - My fianc   is this one.\\
45 - You want me to put this in a travel mug?\\
46 - You didn't tell your mother we're engaged?\\
47 - If she hadn't sold me the house,\\
48 - she wouldn't even know where I live.\\
49 - When were you going to tell her about me?\\
50 - At the wedding?\\
51 - Well, technically, I think we have up to a year after that.\\
52 - Shame on you. I am so sorry.\\
53 - It's all right, dear. I'm used to it.\\
54 - Although a phone call would have been nice.\\
55 - It's good to meet you. Excuse me.\\
56 - (door slamming)\\
57 - So, yea or nay on the travel mug?\\
58 - Charlie, you just broke your mother's heart.\\
59 - (laughing)\\
60 - How is that funny?\\
61 - It's not. Guys, a little respect.\\
62 - What is wrong with you?\\
63 - Same stuff as always, nothing new.\\
64 - Does this smell like butt to you?\\
65 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
66 - * Men.\\
67 - * Men.\\
68 - I'm glad you came over.\\
69 - That was the plan, wasn't it?\\
70 - Yeah, but I thought you might still be angry with me.\\
71 - I'm not angry, Charlie.\\
72 - I'm just disappointed.\\
73 - Gee, I'd kind of prefer it if you were angry.\\
74 - Why?\\
75 - Because angry sex is hot.\\
76 - Disappointed sex is...\\
77 - well, we might as well be married.\\
78 - Just brush your teeth.\\
79 - Brushing.\\
80 - Look, I understand\\
81 - you have a difficult relationship with your mom.\\
82 - Uh-huh.\\
83 - But it makes things kind of tough on me.\\
84 - Hey, I don't expect you to dislike her right away.\\
85 - Give it time. Let it happen naturally.\\
86 - That's not funny.\\
87 - If I'm going to marry into your family,\\
88 - I want us to act like a family, care for each other.\\
89 - With my family, it's kind of either/or.\\
90 - Let me put it this way.\\
91 - I'm taking your mother to lunch on Thursday.\\
92 - (choking and coughing)\\
93 - You're doing what?\\
94 - I'm not going to participate\\
95 - in this childish little feud of yours.\\
96 - It's not a childish feud.\\
97 - Boy.\\
98 - Come on, Charlie. What's wrong with me\\
99 - having a warm and healthy relationship with your mother?\\
100 - Well, for starters, you'll be the only one.\\
101 - Ever.\\
102 - Oh, don't be so dramatic.\\
103 - No, no, no, no.\\
104 - I'm not being dramatic enough.\\
105 - I should be wearing tights and holding a skull.\\
106 - Preferably hers.\\
107 - It's just lunch.\\
108 - That's what Hitler said to Czechoslovakia.\\
109 - Hitler said, "It's just lunch"?\\
110 - Well, he said it in German.\\
111 - Watch the History Channel.\\
112 - Charlie, I'm not doing this to hurt you.\\
113 - Did you ever think that by my spending time with your mother,\\
114 - I can get a better understanding of you?\\
115 - Chelsea, trust me.\\
116 - Any insight you gain into me via my mother\\
117 - will end our relationship\\
118 - faster than catching me in bed with a farm animal.\\
119 - Just relax. It'll be fine.\\
120 - That's what Hitler said to Poland.\\
121 - And for the record,\\
122 - as long as we've been going out, I've never met your mother.\\
123 - My mother's in Illinois.\\
124 - Oh, yeah, and my mother's in "Italy."\\
125 - My mother really lives in Illinois.\\
126 - And besides, when you meet her, you will count your blessings\\
127 - you have someone as wonderful as your mom.\\
128 - Tell you what, I'll trade you.\\
129 - Sight unseen, my mom for yours. Charlie.\\
130 - I'll even throw in Alan and a couple of Omaha steaks.\\
131 - Come here.\\
132 - No, I don't want to.\\
133 - I'm too upset.\\
134 - Okay. Good night.\\
135 - I'm sorry. I can't separate my emotions from my body.\\
136 - I understand.\\
137 - I don't want to punish you.\\
138 - I'm just saying, if my heart's not in it,\\
139 - then it's just my penis going through the motions.\\
140 - Well, we certainly wouldn't want that.\\
141 - Good night.\\
142 - Good night.\\
143 - * Men.\\
144 - Chelsea?\\
145 - I'm not upset anymore.\\
146 - Charlie, I'm sleeping.\\
147 - I know.\\
148 - Can you just wake up enough so it's not weird?\\
149 - Never mind. Sweet dreams.\\
150 - * Men.\\
151 - Okay, let me remind you, this is Malibu beachfront property.\\
152 - The previous owner had a spectacular view\\
153 - as he filled his pockets with rocks and jumped into the pool.\\
154 - Mom?\\
155 - Hang on.\\
156 - No, it's not a suicide home.\\
157 - At most it's...\\
158 - suicide adjacent.\\
159 - All right, get back to me.\\
160 - What are you doing here?\\
161 - What, I can't come visit my mother at work?\\
162 - Well, I suppose you could,\\
163 - but I've been here for 22 years and you never have.\\
164 - Well, maybe if you validated parking.\\
165 - Or any part of my life.\\
166 - What do you want, Charlie?\\
167 - Okay, first of all, I want to apologize\\
168 - for not telling you about Chelsea and the engagement.\\
169 - I know that was wrong and selfish of me.\\
170 - Thank you.\\
171 - Good, I'm glad we got that out of the way.\\
172 - So, I understand you guys are having lunch tomorrow.\\
173 - Yes, we are. Is that a problem?\\
174 - No, no, no, it's great.\\
175 - I came all the way down here and paid for my own parking\\
176 - to tell you it's great.\\
177 - Uh-huh.\\
178 - All right, let's put our cards on the table.\\
179 - What's your angle?\\
180 - Angle?\\
181 - I have no angle.\\
182 - Yeah, and I have no hangover.\\
183 - Look, Charlie, if you're really going to marry this woman,\\
184 - I want to get started on the right foot with her.\\
185 - I don't want to make the same mistake I made\\
186 - with Alan's wife June.\\
187 - Judith.\\
188 - Oh, whatever.\\
189 - Heinous woman.\\
190 - The fact remains, had I overlooked that\\
191 - and welcomed her into the family,\\
192 - she wouldn't have kept me at arm's length\\
193 - all during Jake's formative years\\
194 - and I'd have a better relationship with him today.\\
195 - Do you want a better relationship with him?\\
196 - Not the way he is now.\\
197 - But if I'd gotten to him earlier,\\
198 - he wouldn't have the manners of an outhouse rat.\\
199 - So, bottom line: you want a good relationship with Chelsea\\
200 - so you can get your hooks into the next generation?\\
201 - Can't I just want to be a loving mother and grandmother?\\
202 - Well, I suppose you could,\\
203 - but I've been here 40 years and you never have.\\
204 - (phone rings)\\
205 - Evelyn Harper.\\
206 - Oh, hello, Dr. Yakimora. What's up?\\
207 - Oh...\\
208 - That is good news. What's the address?\\
209 - Nice neighborhood. Thanks for the tip.\\
210 - (hanging phone up)\\
211 - What's the good news?\\
212 - Massive coronary in Brentwood.\\
213 - Six bedrooms, four baths, and a fully equipped gym\\
214 - that that idiot shouldn't have been using.\\
215 - Now, if you'll excuse me,\\
216 - Mommy has to fly faster than the other vultures.\\
217 - * Men.\\
218 - You mother took me to the most adorable little restaurant.\\
219 - No kidding.\\
220 - It's called Mon Grenier du Vivre.\\
221 - You know what that means?\\
222 - Probably "The Spider's Web."\\
223 - Charlie...\\
224 - "The Devil's Barbecue"?\\
225 - Be nice.\\
226 - Sorry.\\
227 - "Bitch in the Box"?\\
228 - So what did you guys talk about?\\
229 - You know, everything.\\
230 - She's so smart and funny.\\
231 - She's been through so much.\\
232 - She's a real survivor.\\
233 - Just remember, in order for her to be a survivor,\\
234 - others had to die.\\
235 - Okay, that's enough.\\
236 - Your mom's a terrific lady.\\
237 - And I'm starting to think\\
238 - that any problem you have with her\\
239 - is your problem, not hers.\\
240 - Oh, damn, it's too late.\\
241 - You're infected with the virus.\\
242 - Stop it.\\
243 - I'm sorry, but when you fall asleep tonight,\\
244 - I'm gonna have to set you on fire.\\
245 - Shut up.\\
246 - Believe me, Charlie, when you meet my mom,\\
247 - you'll thank God for Evelyn.\\
248 - What the hell is your mom,\\
249 - a rabid werewolf that craps hot lava on people?\\
250 - Never mind about my mother. Let's play.\\
251 - I don't know.\\
252 - What's the matter?\\
253 - All this talk about mothers, I'm not in the mood.\\
254 - I bet I could get you in the mood.\\
255 - Maybe, but it'd be a cheap manipulation.\\
256 - All right, but don't come rubbing up against me\\
257 - in the middle of the night.\\
258 - I won't.\\
259 - Fine. Good night.\\
260 - Good night.\\
261 - * Men.\\
262 - Don't even think about it.\\
263 - * Men.\\
264 - * Men.\\
265 - Listen, you gotta do me a favor.\\
266 - That's what I live for.\\
267 - Sarcasm is for winners, Alan.\\
268 - What can I do for you?\\
269 - Chelsea's somehow gotten it into her head\\
270 - that Mom is, you know, human,\\
271 - and you need to set her straight.\\
272 - Why don't you set her straight?\\
273 - I tried, but she doesn't believe me.\\
274 - Probably because I turned out okay.\\
275 - She needs to hear about Mom from somebody whose life\\
276 - is completely wrecked and unsalvageable, i.e., you.\\
277 - Thanks.\\
278 - And what do you expect me to say?\\
279 - I don't know.\\
280 - Just tell her about your phobias, your obsessions,\\
281 - your failures with work, marriage, and parenthood.\\
282 - She'll connect the dots.\\
283 - You know what? I think I'll pass.\\
284 - Oh, come on.\\
285 - I always back you up when you need me.\\
286 - When have you ever backed me up?\\
287 - Okay, let's just stay focused on my problems.\\
288 - Listen, Charlie, I'm not gonna argue\\
289 - that we didn't have a difficult childhood,\\
290 - but really, who had a good one?\\
291 - And isn't it time we forgive and forget?\\
292 - Where's this coming from?\\
293 - No, I'm just saying that maybe our lives would be richer\\
294 - if we let go of this pointless resentment toward our mother\\
295 - and, and just moved on with our lives.\\
296 - She got to you, didn't she?\\
297 - What are you talking about?\\
298 - What did she do? Pay off your car?\\
299 - Get that dead black tooth fixed?\\
300 - Oh, listen to yourself.\\
301 - Hold it.\\
302 - What?\\
303 - Your watch.\\
304 - What about it?\\
305 - It doesn't have Hamburglars on the wristband.\\
306 - So?\\
307 - Let me see it.\\
308 - No, it's mine.\\
309 - Let me see it! Let me see it!\\
310 - This is a Rolex.\\
311 - You sold me out for a watch.\\
312 - Hey, I did not sell you out for a watch!\\
313 - I sold you out for a certified Swiss chronometer.\\
314 - Stainless steel Submariner, waterproof up to 300 meters.\\
315 - And look, it winds itself.\\
316 - Put it on your right arm, it'll run forever.\\
317 - Oh, good thinking.\\
318 - Oh, hey, look what else I got.\\
319 - Genuine porcelain veneer.\\
320 - From an English-speaking dentist.\\
321 - (mocking): From an English-speaking dentist. (sighs)\\
322 - Hey, Jake, I need a favor.\\
323 - Sorry, I can't say bad things about Grandma.\\
324 - Okay, what did she buy you?\\
325 - A new guitar? Minibike?\\
326 - Pizza.\\
327 - You sold me out for a pizza?\\
328 - Not just a pizza. A meat-lover's pizza.\\
329 - * Men.\\
330 - * "M" is for the misery she caused me *\\
331 - * "O" is for the other things she did *\\
332 - * "T" is for the traitor who's my brother *\\
333 - * "H" is for the... hump who is his kid *\\
334 - No, it's true.\\
335 - They can bleach anything these days.\\
336 - Really?\\
337 - It's gotta burn like hell.\\
338 - Oh, like a lit cigar.\\
339 - But it's worth it.\\
340 - Curb appeal isn't just for the front door.\\
341 - * "E" is for extremely frightening girl talk. *\\
342 - Hey, honey.\\
343 - How was shopping? Mom, pick up any new souls?\\
344 - Charlie, that's uncalled for.\\
345 - It's okay, Chelsea.\\
346 - He can't help himself.\\
347 - Yes, he can.\\
348 - There's no excuse for speaking to your mother that way.\\
349 - You don't know that.\\
350 - Evelyn, thank you for a wonderful day.\\
351 - The pleasure was mine.\\
352 - It's nice to be appreciated for a change.\\
353 - Are we on for yoga tomorrow?\\
354 - Can't wait.\\
355 - Oh, and of course, you and Charlie are coming\\
356 - for dinner on Saturday.\\
357 - We wouldn't miss it.\\
358 - Um, uh, actually...\\
359 - Chels, we have plans on Saturday, remember?\\
360 - What plans?\\
361 - Oh, for God's sake,\\
362 - can't you just play along?\\
363 - We'll be there.\\
364 - Wonderful. Ta-ta.\\
365 - Are you proud of yourself?\\
366 - Not really. I lost that one.\\
367 - * "R" is for the rifle in my mouth *\\
368 - * Put them all together, they spell "mother" *\\
369 - * A word that's only half of how I feel. *\\
370 - * Men.\\
371 - (bad French accent): Hello, I am Alan Cousteau.\\
372 - I left the Calypso at...\\
373 - 0500 hours,\\
374 - and have descended to a depth of 60 fathoms.\\
375 - And yet my Rolex is keeping perfect time.\\
376 - Oh, look, there goes a giant squid.\\
377 - Alan?\\
378 - Yes?\\
379 - What are you doing?\\
380 - Um...\\
381 - I got no good answer.\\
382 - It's Saturday night, and I'm all alone.\\
383 - Do you know where Charlie is?\\
384 - We're supposed to be at your mother's at 7:00.\\
385 - (French accent): Oh, you are cutting it close.\\
386 - Have you seen him?\\
387 - Uh, not for a couple of hours. Have you tried his cell?\\
388 - I did. There's no answer. I'm getting worried.\\
389 - (door opens)\\
390 - Chelsea, I'm home.\\
391 - Thank goodness.\\
392 - (French accent): I return to the deep.\\
393 - Where have you been?\\
394 - Picking up a little surprise for you.\\
395 - Come on in.\\
396 - Mom?\\
397 - Hello, sweetie. Oh!\\
398 - Ooh, feels like you gave up on the Jenny Craig, huh?\\
399 - What are you doing here?\\
400 - I flew her in from Illinois.\\
401 - First class. Very swanky.\\
402 - Of course, I had some rich Jew lawyer\\
403 - chewing my ear off the whole way.\\
404 - Tell her about the food.\\
405 - Oh, the food was terrific,\\
406 - but the flight attendant was a colored homo.\\
407 - I'm glad they make 'em pick up the dinner rolls with tongs\\
408 - 'cause I can't risk the AIDS.\\
409 - I hope you didn't fill up.\\
410 - We're going to my mom's for dinner.\\
411 - Oh, how nice.\\
412 - Now be honest with me, Charlie.\\
413 - You're so dark and handsome,\\
414 - you gotta have some dago in ya, right?\\
415 - God, I love your mom.\\
416 - * Men.\\
417 - That was the worst dinner of my life.\\
418 - Really?\\
419 - I thought the two moms hit it off.\\
420 - Kinda country mouse, city mouse.\\
421 - I especially liked the part\\
422 - when country mouse kicked off her shoes,\\
423 - put her big yellow bunions on city mouse's mahogany coffee table\\
424 - and asked her how she liked having a commie A-rab for a president.\\
425 - You've made your point, Charlie.\\
426 - Point? Whatever do you mean?\\
427 - You leave my mother alone, and I'll leave yours alone.\\
428 - Well, gosh, I don't know.\\
429 - I've really taken a shine to your mom.\\
430 - She promised to teach me\\
431 - how to chew tobacco and burn a cross.\\
432 - Do we have a deal or not?\\
433 - Deal. Come here.\\
434 - I'm not in the mood.\\
435 - All right, but don't be rubbing up against me\\
436 - in the middle of the night.\\
437 - Don't worry. I won't.\\
438 - Good night.\\
439 - Good night.\\
440 - All right, I was bluffing.\\
441 - Feel free to rub.\\
442 - Rub yourself.\\
443 - Chels?\\
444 - What?\\
445 - Can you watch me so it's not weird?

7 - Building an original 1978 Firebird.\\
8 - Got it on eBay.\\
9 - Okay.\\
10 - Why?\\
11 - I had this model when I was little, remember?\\
12 - I spent a month building it and painting it\\
13 - and putting on all the decals.\\
14 - Is that the one I tried to make a bong out of?\\
15 - No, that was my Munster Mobile.\\
16 - And my ventriloquist dummy.\\
17 - And my Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots.\\
18 - My Firebird you blow-torched\\
19 - with a cigarette lighter and Mom's Aqua Net.\\
20 - Oh, yeah, the "Fire"-bird.\\

22 - I am gonna have it again, right?\\

33 - I'm worried about my brother.\\
34 - Why? Well...\\
35 - he's either so lonely,\\
36 - he's trying to recapture his childhood,\\
37 - which was not that good in the first place,\\
38 - or he's created an elaborate ruse to hide the fact\\
39 - that he's become a degenerate glue-sniffer.\\
40 - To be honest, I'm rootin' for the glue.\\
41 - You know, I've been meaning to talk to you about him.\\
42 - You want him gone? He's gone.\\
43 - That's how much I love you.\\
44 - No, no, he's a wonderful guy.\\
45 - I actually have a friend that I think might be a good match for him.\\
46 - Oh, no, you're wrong.\\
47 - Oh, come on, Charlie.\\
48 - Listen...\\
49 - * ...started to think\\
50 - * About leaving tonight\\
51 - * Although nothing seemed...\\
52 - You don't want to do that to a friend, do you?\\
53 - Alan's a doll.\\
54 - He just needs to find the right woman.\\
55 - If you check his closet,\\
56 - you'll find the right woman is a doll.\\
57 - At least let me try.\\
58 - I'll set up a dinner with the four of us.\\
59 - It'll be fun.\\
60 - For who?\\
61 - It's bad enough you want to punish your friend.\\
62 - Why do I have to suffer?\\
63 - Isn't it worth one night of your life\\
64 - to maybe make two people happy?\\
65 - That's not fair.\\
66 - I always come off bad\\
67 - when I answer questions like that truthfully.\\
68 - Just do it for me.\\
69 - (groans)\\
70 - Is that a yes?\\
71 - (groans)\\
72 - Remember those words when we go to bed tonight.\\
73 - What words?\\
74 - "Just do it for me."\\
75 - So, anyway,\\
76 - he's Charlie's brother and a very sweet guy\\
77 - and I really think you'll like him.\\

89 - You were gonna spend the night building a scale model\\
90 - of TheDukes of Hazzard car.\\
91 - Ah, actually I just finished theGeneral Lee.\\
92 - Now I'm working on Burt Reynolds' Trans Am\\
93 - from Smokey and the Bandit.\\
94 - Okay, okay, just promise me\\
95 - you won't bring any of that up tonight.\\
96 - Why? Why?!\\
97 - You're asking me why a 40-year-old man shouldn't talk\\
98 - about model cars on a first date?\\
99 - Hmm.\\
100 - I see your point.\\
101 - Leave a little mystery.\\
102 - Yeah, that's my point.\\
103 - Come on.\\
104 - Oh, speaking of mystery,\\
105 - I am currently the high bidder\\
106 - on an original, mint in the box Scooby-Doo Mystery Machine.\\
107 - * Men. *\\
108 - How do I look?\\
109 - Don't open that can of worms.\\
110 - You are what you are.\\
111 - There's Chelsea.\\
112 - Sorry we're late. No, no,\\
113 - we were early. You look great!\\
114 - Thank you. So do you.\\
115 - Charlie, Alan, this is my friend Rose.\\
116 - Rose,\\
117 - this is Charlie and Alan.\\
118 - It's nice to meet you, Alan.\\
119 - No, that's Charlie.\\
120 - Ooh, even better.\\
121 - Hi, Alan.\\
122 - Hi.\\
123 - Why don't we all sit down?\\
124 - So many reasons.\\
125 - Chelsea's told me so much about you boys.\\
126 - It-It's so nice to finally meet you.\\
127 - Alan, I understand you're a chiropractor.\\
128 - Yes.\\
129 - I'm a chiropractor.\\
130 - Charlie?\\
131 - Yes.\\
132 - He is a chiropractor.\\
133 - Oh, that's just terrific.\\
134 - And what do you do, Charlie?\\
135 - Um...\\
136 - I write kids' songs and jingles.\\
137 - Alan?\\
138 - Yes.\\
139 - He writes kids' songs and jingles.\\
140 - And I am a chiropractor.\\
141 - Yes, he's a chiropractor.\\
142 - They don't get out much, do they?\\
143 - Apparently not.\\
144 - So, Chels, where did you meet...\\
145 - Rose.\\
146 - Right.\\
147 - Rose.\\
148 - Yoga class.\\
149 - No kiddin'.\\
150 - Yeah.\\
151 - And then we ran into each other at Pilates,\\
152 - and the manicurist,\\
153 - and jogging,\\
154 - and the dry cleaner.\\
155 - Crazy, huh?\\
156 - Sure are. Sure is.\\
157 - Seemed like every time I turned around, there she was.\\
158 - Seemed like every time I turned around, there you were.\\
159 - I thought maybe you were stalking me.\\
160 - (both laugh)\\
161 - That's funny.\\
162 - Good one. Yeah.\\
163 - Can I start you off with cocktails?\\
164 - I think I need to stay sober tonight.\\
165 - But you guys go ahead.\\
166 - I'll have a Chardonnay.\\
167 - I'll be right back.\\
168 - I'll go with you.\\
169 - I'll have a double vodka rocks.\\
170 - I feel a little reckless tonight.\\
171 - Fun personality, huh?\\
172 - Yeah.\\
173 - Unfortunately, she's got six more of them.\\
174 - And for you, sir?\\
175 - Whiskey, neat.\\
176 - Since when do you drink hard liquor?\\
177 - Since right now.\\
178 - I'd order a glass of crack if it were on the menu.\\
179 - Tru dat.\\
180 - Why didn't you say something?\\
181 - Why didn't you say something?\\
182 - I was following your lead.\\
183 - What lead?\\
184 - The minute I saw her, I practically peed my pants.\\
185 - Well then, I did follow your lead.\\
186 - So-So what are we going to do now?\\
187 - I don't know.\\
188 - I guess we play along.\\
189 - Play along?!\\
190 - Are you serious?!\\
191 - What am I supposed to do, Alan?\\
192 - Tell the truth?\\
193 - "Oh Chelsea, I almost forgot,\\
194 - "your new BFF and I had a one-night stand\\
195 - "and when I dumped her, she superglued my nutsack\\
196 - "to my thigh and started stalking me.\\
197 - "Oh, and then\\
198 - "I thought maybe I was in love with her\\
199 - "and followed her to England.\\
200 - "And then when she came back from England,\\
201 - I thought I was dying and almost asked her to marry me."\\
202 - Yeah, when you put it in story form,\\
203 - it really does sound bad.\\
204 - So, we play along\\
205 - until I can find out what Rose's angle is.\\
206 - So, what, I'm supposed to date her?!\\
207 - Stop flattering yourself.\\
208 - This isn't about you.\\
209 - It's me she's interested in.\\
210 - What are you saying, I'm not good enough for her?\\
211 - What are you saying,\\
212 - you want that looney tune as a girlfriend?\\
213 - No!\\
214 - But I am currently unattached.\\
215 - Now, you listen to me,\\
216 - this is a blind date that goes no further.\\
217 - You understand?\\
218 - I got it.\\
219 - (whispers): She really likes him.\\
220 - Swell.\\
221 - * Men. *\\
222 - I thought there was real chemistry between them.\\
223 - I'm sure they have some meds in common.\\
224 - But I wouldn't get your hopes up.\\
225 - Why not?\\
226 - She's not his type.\\
227 - What do you mean?\\
228 - She's pretty, smart, rich...\\
229 - Okay, then, he's not her type.\\
230 - ("Cars" by Gary Numan playing)\\
231 - (both moaning)\\
232 - This is crazy.\\
233 - I know.\\
234 - We just met.\\
235 - * Men. *\\
236 - * Men. *\\
237 - Oh no, no,\\
238 - no, you idiot.\\
239 - Morning, Charlie.\\
240 - Morning.\\
241 - Should've smothered him in the crib\\
242 - when I had the chance.\\
243 - Boy, take one day off for a poker tournament\\
244 - and you miss a whole lot around here.\\
245 - You said you were sick.\\
246 - I was healed. It's a miracle.\\
247 - You want to catch me up?\\
248 - Chelsea set Alan up on a blind date\\
249 - with a girl she met at yoga class.\\
250 - Well, what's he doing with Rose?\\
251 - She's the girl.\\
252 - Oh.\\
253 - Diabolical.\\
254 - So Chelsea doesn't know...\\
255 - Chelsea knows nothing and I want to keep it that way.\\
256 - Okay.\\
257 - Why is Alan playing along?\\
258 - Because Alan is a horny idiot.\\
259 - And horny idiots are perfectly willing\\
260 - to have sex with crazy girls.\\
261 - Yeah, I know. But I've grown.\\
262 - Charlie, did you see?\\
263 - Yeah, I saw.\\
264 - Told you they'd hit it off.\\
265 - Didn't I tell you?\\
266 - You told me.\\
267 - I'm a little worried they're moving so fast.\\
268 - Yeah, that's the worrisome part.\\
269 - Berta, have you met Rose yet?\\
270 - Screw it, I'm going home.\\
271 - Feel better!\\
272 - * Men. *\\
273 - ALAN: Cut it out!\\
274 - (giggling): Stop it.\\
275 - Hello.\\
276 - Sit down.\\
277 - Um, you know I have company.\\
278 - Yes, I know you have company, now, sit down!\\
279 - Okay.\\
280 - 'Sup?\\
281 - Explain it to me, Alan.\\
282 - Help me understand.\\
283 - You mean Rose?\\
284 - No, I mean the internal combustion engine!\\
285 - Yes, Rose!\\
286 - Uh, well, we, uh, we started talking\\
287 - on the ride home last night, and we really hit it off.\\
288 - She has changed, Charlie.\\
289 - Changed?!\\
290 - She was stalking my fianc  e.\\
291 - Ah, ah, well, actually, she explained all that.\\
292 - Really? Mm-hmm.\\
293 - What did she say?\\
294 - Uh, well, um...\\
295 - Okay, I don't remember all the details\\
296 - 'cause she was tweaking my nipples at the time.\\
297 - Oh... hi, Charlie.\\
298 - All right, Rose, what are you up to?\\
299 - What do you mean?\\
300 - I'm telling you right now,\\
301 - I love Chelsea and if you mess things up with us,\\
302 - I will never forgive you.\\
303 - Wow.\\
304 - What did I ever do to deserve that?\\
305 - You're kidding, right?\\
306 - Yeah.\\
307 - So, once again,\\
308 - what are you up to?\\
309 - Okay, at first, I was just doing\\
310 - a little light recon on Chelsea\\
311 - to make sure you weren't dating a whack job.\\
312 - You thought Chelsea might be...\\
313 - Go on.\\
314 - Well, good news, she's not.\\
315 - She's got a cousin who's a truck stop hooker\\
316 - and her mom's an honorary Kleagle in the Ku Klux Klan,\\
317 - but Chelsea is clean as a whistle.\\
318 - Kleagle?\\
319 - According to Wikipedia it's below Grand Dragon\\
320 - and above Exalted Cyclops.\\
321 - Sure, whatever.\\
322 - What's the deal with the lunch lady here?\\
323 - Alan?\\
324 - Well, that was Chelsea's idea, not mine.\\
325 - I tried to get out of it. Really?\\
326 - I'm sorry, sweetie,\\
327 - but I thought a double date with Charlie and his fianc  e\\
328 - might be a little awkward.\\
329 - A little awkward?\\
330 - When I saw you sitting there,\\
331 - my sphincter slammed shut so quickly,\\
332 - you could've used it as a cigar cutter!\\
333 - Yeah, you should've seen your face.\\
334 - Anyway, it all worked out for the best.\\
335 - Last night, I saw a side of your brother\\
336 - that I've never seen before.\\
337 - What side?\\
338 - He's only got the two.\\
339 - "Oh, no, here he comes" and "Oh good, he's leaving."\\
340 - Look, Charlie, this has nothing to do\\
341 - with you and Chelsea.\\
342 - This has nothing to do with you and Rose.\\
343 - The fact is, we really like each other\\
344 - and we want to keep seeing each other.\\
345 - And we'd really like your blessing.\\
346 - So, you actually want to be with him?\\
347 - I do.\\
348 - And you believe she's got no ulterior motive whatsoever?\\
349 - I do.\\
350 - Fine.\\
351 - I now pronounce you fruit basket and nutcase.\\
352 - May God have mercy on your souls.\\
353 - Yay!\\
354 - Uh, I don't think that was really a blessing, Rose.\\
355 - It doesn't matter.\\
356 - So what are we doing this afternoon?\\
357 - Oh, uh, gee, I gotta pick up Jake.\\
358 - Um, I promised him I'd take him to the movies.\\
359 - You know, a little father-son time.\\
360 - Oh, that's sweet.\\
361 - Well, just call me when you want to get together again.\\
362 - Sure, or you can call me.\\
363 - Okay.\\
364 - (cell phone ringing)\\
365 - Hello?\\
366 - Oh, Jake, thank God.\\
367 - Uh, nothing.\\
368 - Wait, hang on, I got another call.\\
369 - Hello?\\
370 - Yes, Rose, this is my number.\\
371 - * Men. *\\
372 - So how did you like the movie?\\
373 - It was an insult to my intelligence.\\
374 - Really?\\
375 - Everybody knows zombies can't ride motorcycles.\\
376 - Yeah, that bumped me, too.\\
377 - And why would they wear helmets?\\
378 - They're dead.\\
379 - Another good point.\\
380 - I don't know who they're\\
381 - making movies for these days.\\
382 - Fine, next time, you pick.\\
383 - Anyway, there's something I want to talk to you about.\\
384 - Oh, come on, it was one fart during the previews\\
385 - and everybody laughed.\\
386 - No, no, not that.\\
387 - Uh, I just want you to know\\
388 - that I've been dating somebody\\
389 - and you might be meeting her soon.\\
390 - Oh, okay, good.\\
391 - So, you have no problem with that?\\
392 - Not at all; you should have a girlfriend.\\
393 - You think so?\\
394 - Yeah, the model car stuff is starting to freak me out.\\
395 - I mean, seriously.\\
396 - You're a grown man.\\
397 - (horn honking)\\
398 - What the hell?\\
399 - You didn't call me!\\
400 - Hi, Rose.\\
401 - So, tell me about your new girlfriend.\\
402 - * Men. *\\
403 - I'm so glad you forgave me for my little outburst in the car.\\
404 - Well, you have a very compelling way of apologizing.\\
405 - But we need to have a little talk about boundaries.\\
406 - It was just my pinky, Alan.\\
407 - No, no, that was fun.\\
408 - Is it about me following\\
409 - you and Jake into the movie theater?\\
410 - You followed us into the movie theater?!\\
411 - No...\\
412 - Look, Rose, I really like you\\
413 - but you've got to realize\\
414 - that people need their space.\\
415 - And you need to respect that.\\
416 - All right.\\
417 - So, we're clear on that?\\
418 - Yes. I'm sorry.\\
419 - It won't happen again.\\
420 - Hm. Good.\\
421 - Well, good night.\\
422 - Good night.\\
423 - Boy, this is an Alan Harper I haven't seen before.\\
424 - Uh-huh.\\
425 - Forceful, confident...\\
426 - Thank you.\\
427 - I don't like him very much.\\
428 - * Men. *\\
429 - Morning, Charlie.\\
430 - Morning, Rose.\\
431 - Alan needs his space.\\
432 - I'm gonna give it to him.\\
433 - Okay. Say hi to Chelsea for me.\\
434 - Will do.\\
435 - Oh, I got a bad feeling.\\
436 - Alan?\\
437 - Yeah?\\
438 - You okay?\\
439 - Been better.\\
440 - I'm coming in.\\
441 - Hi.\\
442 - Hi.\\
443 - Impressive.\\
444 - It's not me.\\
445 - No kidding.\\
446 - What is it?\\
447 - Oh, Burt Reynolds' Trans Am from Smokey and the Bandit.\\
448 - Yep.\\
449 - Would you care to explain why it's parked\\
450 - in your handicapped spot?\\
451 - Not parked.\\
452 - Glued.\\
453 - Ah.\\
454 - Rose?\\
455 - Rose.\\
456 - Told ya. You did.\\
457 - But did you listen? Nope.\\
458 - Okay.\\
459 - Happy motoring.\\
460 - * Here in my car\\
461 - * I feel safest of all...\\
462 - * Scooby Dooby Doo\\
463 - * Where are you?\\
464 - * We got some work to do now\\
465 - * Scooby Scooby Doo\\
466 - * Where are you?\\
467 - * We need some help from you now... *\\
468 - I feel bad it didn't work out with Alan and Rose.\\
469 - Me, too.\\
470 - Terrible.\\
471 - The problem is they jumped into bed too fast.\\
472 - The problem is he doesn't keep his glue solvent\\
473 - in his night stand.\\
474 - What's that mean?\\
475 - Another way of saying what you said.\\
476 - ALAN: Ow!\\
477 - Ah...\\
478 - Oh...\\
479 - What's wrong with him?\\
480 - Little car accident.
\subsection {Episode 22: Sir Lancelot's Litter Box}
1 - Oh, come on, Chelsea. Is this about money?\\
2 - 'Cause I'd be happy to pay the lease\\
3 - on your apartment.\\
4 - It's not about money, you ass.\\
5 - I just think it's ridiculous\\
6 - that we're engaged and not living together.\\
7 - Well, excuse me for being old-fashioned,\\
8 - I'm just not comfortable with us living in sin.\\
9 - So you think we should stop having sex?\\
10 - No, no, no, it's not the sin I object to,\\
11 - it's the living in it.\\
12 - CHELSEA: Charlie, there is no reason\\
13 - for me to renew the lease on my apartment\\
14 - when I'm here every night.\\
15 - CHARLIE: And I love having you here every night...\\
16 - You going to eat your pickle?\\
17 - Yes, I'm going to eat my pickle.\\
18 - But you're almost done with your sandwich,\\
19 - and your pickle's just sitting there.\\
20 - I like to eat it last.\\
21 - How very European of you.\\
22 - Here's another pickle.\\
23 - Shut up.\\
24 - Oh, you are just so full of it!\\
25 - Give me one good reason why I shouldn't be living here.\\
26 - I can give you several.\\
27 - This ought to be good.\\
28 - CHELSEA: Go ahead.\\
29 - CHARLIE: Oh, you mean right now?\\
30 - Dance, monkey, dance.\\
31 - Okay.\\
32 - Well, there's the safety issue.\\
33 - You should keep your apartment\\
34 - for the same reason\\
35 - that airplanes are equipped with oxygen masks,\\
36 - and cruise ships have life rafts.\\
37 - You know, if the Titanic had enough life rafts,\\
38 - Leonardo and Kate would've lived happily ever after.\\
39 - Oops.\\
40 - CHELSEA: You're comparing our relationship\\
41 - to the Titanic?!\\
42 - Rope-a-dope, rope-a-dope.\\
43 - CHARLIE: No, no, no, of course not.\\
44 - But P.S., that was a very romantic movie.\\
45 - Thanks for making me watch it again.\\
46 - He's still swinging.\\
47 - The kid's got heart.\\
48 - CHARLIE: Where are you going?\\
49 - CHELSEA: Home! See?\\
50 - You just proved my point.\\
51 - Where would you go right now\\
52 - if you didn't have your own apartment?\\
53 - I suppose you all enjoyed listening to that.\\
54 - Huh? Beg pardon?\\
55 - I enjoyed it.\\
56 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
57 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
58 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\
59 - * Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *\\
60 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
61 - * Ooh * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
62 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
63 - * Men.\\
64 - Can't sleep, huh?\\
65 - No.\\
66 - This Chelsea-moving-in thing is really bugging me.\\
67 - Why are you up?\\
68 - Well, I realized you were out here drinking yourself\\
69 - into a miserable stupor over this whole situation and...\\
70 - I just want to be a part of that.\\
71 - Thanks.\\
72 - I hate to say it,\\
73 - but I think Chelsea might be right.\\
74 - You don't hate to say it.\\
75 - Oh, did I say I hate to say it?\\
76 - I meant I can't wait to say it.\\
77 - But I did admire\\
78 - how you ferociously defended an unwinnable position\\
79 - by comparing your relationship to the Titanic.\\
80 - That was beautiful.\\
81 - Oh, come on,\\
82 - who remembers the names of boats that don't sink?\\
83 - Sure, sure.\\
84 - I couldn't give you a zeppelinother\\
85 - than the Hindenburg.\\
86 - Still, it was not your finest moment.\\
87 - There was a time it would've worked.\\
88 - Yeah, back\\
89 - when you were dating silicone simpletons.\\
90 - Unfortunately, Chelsea is too smart for your crap.\\
91 - Yeah.\\
92 - And there's not an ounce of silicone in those babies.\\
93 - Shoot.\\
94 - I owe Berta five bucks.\\
95 - Uh, b-but more to the point,\\
96 - why are you so afraid to have her move in?\\
97 - I'm not afraid of her moving in, that's easy.\\
98 - Moving her out's the bitch.\\
99 - So, you're already assuming you're going to break up?\\
100 - Oh, come on,\\
101 - what evidence is there to suggest\\
102 - that it'll end any other way?\\
103 - Well, I think she's capable of a long-term commitment.\\
104 - And you, you could...\\
105 - change.\\
106 - You don't believe that.\\
107 - No, I was just trying to be supportive.\\
108 - Well, you're not doing a very good job.\\
109 - I'm not trying very hard.\\
110 - Let me ask you a question.\\
111 - What did you think was gonna happen\\
112 - when you and Chelsea got married?\\
113 - Honestly, I never thought that far ahead.\\
114 - I figured we could stretch the engagement thing out\\
115 - for a couple of years, and by then, who knows.\\
116 - Maybe I'd die, maybe she'd get fat.\\
117 - Well, kudos to you\\
118 - for not bringing that up in the argument.\\
119 - It wasn't easy.\\
120 - You know what you have to do, don't you?\\
121 - I don't have to do anything, Alan.\\
122 - If not living together is a deal breaker,\\
123 - then she's free to break off the engagement\\
124 - and go on her merry way.\\
125 - She most certainly is.\\
126 - So you know what you have to do.\\
127 - (mockingly): Yes, I know what I have to do.\\
128 - Are you done torturing me?\\
129 - Yeah, almost.\\
130 - I'm the king of the world!\\
131 - Okay, now I'm done.\\
132 - * Men.\\
133 - Here.\\
134 - What's this?\\
135 - Alan's house key.\\
136 - Why?\\
137 - 'Cause I want you to move in,\\
138 - and I didn't have time to make a new one.\\
139 - Plus, he kind of pissed me off last night.\\
140 - You want me to move in?\\
141 - Yes.\\
142 - I thought about it, and you were right.\\
143 - Uh-huh.\\
144 - Which is not to say I was wrong,\\
145 - but, uh...\\
146 - Okay, I was wrong.\\
147 - You're sure you want me to move in?\\
148 - Absolutely not.\\
149 - But I figure what the hell.\\
150 - I mean, it's gonna happen sooner or later, right?\\
151 - Oh, shut up.\\
152 - Come on in, I'll make some coffee.\\
153 - What's all this?\\
154 - Let's just say I had faith in you.\\
155 - Oh.\\
156 - Oh...!\\
157 - Ew.\\
158 - * Men.\\
159 - Those go upstairs in the master bedroom.\\
160 - Careful, they're fragile.\\
161 - Okay, you and me need to talk.\\
162 - I know. I know.\\
163 - You didn't sign up for this.\\
164 - You work for me, not for her,\\
165 - and it's bad enough you have to put up with Zippy and the chimp.\\
166 - No.\\
167 - I like her better than you, so from now on I'm working for her.\\
168 - What?\\
169 - You need something, you ask her,\\
170 - she talks to me, we decide.\\
171 - I don't get a vote?\\
172 - Yeah, you get a vote.\\
173 - One vote out of three.\\
174 - Good luck with that.\\
175 - Oh, boy.\\
176 - CHELSEA: You like it?\\
177 - Oh, boy!\\
178 - Don't the colors just liven the place up?\\
179 - Well...\\
180 - uh...\\
181 - Oh, boy!\\
182 - Come on, I want to show you what I did in the bathroom.\\
183 - Oh, boy.\\
184 - What do you think?\\
185 - I don't know.\\
186 - I have this sudden urge to pee sitting down.\\
187 - You like the new towels?\\
188 - I guess.\\
189 - What was wrong with the old ones?\\
190 - They didn't match my shower curtain.\\
191 - What was wrong with my shower curtain?\\
192 - Didn't match your towels.\\
193 - Maybe that's how I tell them apart.\\
194 - Oh, oh, please tell me\\
195 - that's one of those Zen sand gardens.\\
196 - You know very well that's Sir Lancelot's litter box.\\
197 - You brought the cat?\\
198 - Of course I brought the cat.\\
199 - What did you think I was gonna do with him?\\
200 - I don't know.\\
201 - Return him to the wild?\\
202 - You're being ridiculous.\\
203 - Is it ridiculous\\
204 - to want the turds in my bathroom to be human?\\
205 - Fine, we'll put it in the laundry room.\\
206 - Near my clean clothes?\\
207 - Forget it.\\
208 - So where am I supposed to put it?\\
209 - Oh, I don't think you really want me\\
210 - to tell you where to put it.\\
211 - CHARLIE: I'm just saying it's too much!\\
212 - Pillows, towels, shower curtains, cat crap!\\
213 - I don't like it,\\
214 - I don't need it, I don't want it!\\
215 - CHELSEA: What do you want me to do, Charlie?!\\
216 - You want me to leave?!\\
217 - CHARLIE: No, no, no!\\
218 - You just got here! I'll leave!\\
219 - It'll make more room for you\\
220 - and Sir Crapsalot! (door slams)\\
221 - Get a good earful?\\
222 - No. I did.\\
223 - And I don't appreciate being called Sir Crapsalot.\\
224 - Oh, good.\\
225 - For some reason, I can't find my house key.\\
226 - I hope you're happy with yourself.\\
227 - Why would I start now?\\
228 - * Men.\\
229 - Hey.\\
230 - How'd you find me?\\
231 - Wasn't hard.\\
232 - When you're not volunteering to read stories to the elderly\\
233 - or feed the homeless, you're usually here.\\
234 - Sea breeze, extra pineapple.\\
235 - I'm not cut out for this living together stuff, Alan.\\
236 - I mean, I tried, I really tried.\\
237 - That's true.\\
238 - You gave it a whole, uh...\\
239 - hour and 20 minutes.\\
240 - Hey, now Berta owes me five bucks.\\
241 - Charlie, it's not really that difficult to live with a woman.\\
242 - Says the man who's been thrown out twice.\\
243 - I didn't say it wasn't hard for them.\\
244 - Did you see the salt and pepper shakers\\
245 - Chelsea put in the kitchen?\\
246 - No.\\
247 - They're like these foot-high ceramic roosters\\
248 - with little S and P holes in their beaks.\\
249 - Cute. I think I saw those in the Williams-Sonoma catalog.\\
250 - What am I freaking out about?\\
251 - A woman's been living with me for six years.\\
252 - Cheap shot.\\
253 - Canned pineapple?\\
254 - (sighs)\\
255 - (clicks tongue)\\
256 - It's not just the salt shakers.\\
257 - It's the fancy pillows on the bed,\\
258 - the fruity towels in the bathroom,\\
259 - and then there's the clothes and the shoes.\\
260 - Oh, my God, the shoes.\\
261 - She's got almost as many as I do!\\
262 - And lest we forget,\\
263 - she brought her big, fat, pooping cat to live with us.\\
264 - As opposed to what, having it put to sleep?\\
265 - I suggested letting it go.\\
266 - I didn't even think of that.\\
267 - The cat aside, you do know it was wrong\\
268 - to storm out the way you did.\\
269 - Of course I know.\\
270 - I'm an ass, not an idiot.\\
271 - One does not preclude the other.\\
272 - You realize this has nothing to do\\
273 - with the cat or the towels or the pillows, don't you?\\
274 - Tell you what.\\
275 - Here's 20 bucks.\\
276 - Don't tell me what it's really about.\\
277 - Boy,\\
278 - you're putting me in a tough spot here, Charlie.\\
279 - 40.\\
280 - Good night.\\
281 - Nah, I care too much about you two kids.\\
282 - Here.\\
283 - Now, the reason you panicked is that...\\
284 - This is just 20.\\
285 - Is it?\\
286 - Oh. My mistake.\\
287 - The reason you panicked and ran away\\
288 - is that you recognize that the old Charlie is dying.\\
289 - But what you have to understand is,\\
290 - he has to die in order for a new Charlie to be born.\\
291 - Well, that makes sense. Mm-hmm.\\
292 - Let me ask you a question. Of course.\\
293 - Does the new Charlie still have the old brother?\\
294 - Absolutely, and he's here for you.\\
295 - Man, I can't catch a break.\\
296 - So, how pissed off was Chelsea when I left?\\
297 - It was pretty bad at first.\\
298 - Did you really suggest\\
299 - that she do something anatomically impossible\\
300 - with the kitty litter box?\\
301 - I didn't suggest anything.\\
302 - She may have inferred.\\
303 - Oh. Well, regardless, I think I may have been able\\
304 - to smooth it over for you a little bit.\\
305 - Really? What'd you say? Mm-hmm.\\
306 - Uh, I said you had the emotional maturity\\
307 - of a nine year-old, and that she had to make allowances.\\
308 - That's good. Mm-hmm.\\
309 - That's good. Make it her fault.\\
310 - So now all you have to do is go home,\\
311 - admit that you're a frightened little man\\
312 - who doesn't deserve her love, and beg for her forgiveness.\\
313 - Groveling comes easy for you, doesn't it?\\
314 - Not at first. I didn't really hit my stride\\
315 - till my second marriage.\\
316 - Oh, by the way, have you seen my house key anywhere?\\
317 - Nope.\\
318 - * Men.\\
319 - ALAN'S VOICE: Oh, Chelsea, I was such a fool.\\
320 - Thank God my brother talked some sense into me.\\
321 - (as Chelsea): Oh, Charlie, I love your brother.\\
322 - ALAN'S VOICE: He's so smart and masculine,\\
323 - and yet, his feminine side makes him sensitive\\
324 - and intuitive.\\
325 - You're right.\\
326 - I only tease him 'cause I'm jealous.\\
327 - And secretly gay.\\
328 - (Berta laughs)\\
329 - Oh, hello.\\
330 - Don't worry.\\
331 - This ain't the most embarrassing thing\\
332 - I ever walked in on you doing.\\
333 - Oh, yeah. Thanks for not making a big thing about that.\\
334 - Right back at ya.\\
335 - You know, I really should cut down\\
336 - on the talking to myself.\\
337 - (in funny voice): Yes, you should.\\
338 - It's getting a little weird.\\
339 - Son of a bitch!\\
340 - Can I say I'm sorry again, or are you sick of it?\\
341 - Mm. Say it again. Let's see.\\
342 - I'm sorry.\\
343 - Nope. Still fun.\\
344 - And?\\
345 - And... I'm a big, stupid jerk.\\
346 - And?\\
347 - And I'd really like to go upstairs\\
348 - and finish this apology with my mouth.\\
349 - (rattling on French doors)\\
350 - Charlie, a moment?\\
351 - Not now, Alan.\\
352 - Uh, yeah, well, there's a bit of a situation,\\
353 - and I'm afraid I'm gonna have to insist.\\
354 - I'd better talk to him.\\
355 - He's about to go full fruit fly.\\
356 - What is your problem?\\
357 - Well, I noticed you put a lot of stuff in my room,\\
358 - and I was wondering how long it was gonna stay there.\\
359 - I've been wondering the same thing about you.\\
360 - Come on, Charlie.\\
361 - How am I supposed to live in that room\\
362 - if you and Chelsea are gonna use it as a walk-in closet?\\
363 - Tell you what.\\
364 - I'll give you a break on the rent.\\
365 - I haven't been paying rent. There it is!\\
366 - Fine. I'll manage somehow.\\
367 - Alan, wait. What?\\
368 - I need you to pull your car out of the garage. Why?\\
369 - You don't expect Chelsea to park on the street, do you?\\
370 - So, I have to park on the street?\\
371 - You don't have to.\\
372 - You can park it at your place.\\
373 - I don't have a place. There it is!\\
374 - You can leave your clicker on the coffee table.\\
375 - Wait, wait, Charlie, if I don't have a clicker,\\
376 - and I don't have a house key, how am I supposed to get in?\\
377 - There it is!\\
378 - * Men.\\
379 - I don't have to pee.\\
380 - I don't have to pee.\\
381 - Damn it, I have to pee.\\
382 - (sighs)\\
383 - (thudding)\\
384 - (sighs)\\
385 - Ow.\\
386 - Son of a bitch.\\
387 - Oh, ski poles! Oh!\\
388 - (thudding)\\
389 - Ow.\\
390 - (cat yowling, Alan shouts)\\
391 - Oh, good.\\
392 - A litter box.\\
393 - * Men.\\
394 - This is delicious.\\
395 - Sure is.\\
396 - Glad you like it.\\
397 - There's plenty more.\\
398 - Jake, would you pass me the chicken?\\
399 - It's fish, Dad.\\
400 - Hope you're not allergic to Sir Lancelot.\\
401 - I'll be fine\\
402 - as long as he doesn't sleep on my face again.\\
403 - He is a snuggler, isn't he?\\
404 - Yeah.\\
405 - By the way, do you know\\
406 - if anybody rented your old apartment yet?\\
407 - Actually, somebody just scooped it up.\\
408 - Oh. Why? Are you thinking of moving out?\\
409 - Well, obviously, there's not a lot of room for me here.\\
410 - What's a place like that go for?\\
411 - $1,800 a month.\\
412 - On the other hand,\\
413 - it's nice to be close to family.\\
414 - Well, you got no shame at all, do you?\\
415 - I assume that's a rhetorical question.\\
416 - Where's Uncle Charlie?\\
417 - Said he had some sort of meeting.\\
418 - That means poker or strip club.\\
419 - I'm sure it's poker.\\
420 - * Men.\\
421 - (doorbell rings)\\
422 - Ooh, pizza.\\
423 - Hey, Gordon, small world.\\
424 - Hey, Mr. Harper. What are you doing here?\\
425 - Oh, I just rented this place.\\
426 - Decided I needed a weekend getaway.\\
427 - From Malibu?\\
428 - You'd be surprised.\\
429 - It gets crowded sometimes.\\
430 - Okay. What happened to that beautiful woman\\
431 - that used to lived here?\\
432 - She lives with me in Malibu.\\
433 - We're engaged.\\
434 - And you're hanging out here all alone?\\
435 - Yup.\\
436 - You know what you are, Mr. Harper?\\
437 - What?\\
438 - A genius.\\
439 - Thanks, Gordon.\\
440 - Good night. Good night.\\
441 - It's nice when someone gets you.\\
442 - * Men.
\subsection {Episode 23: Good Morning, Mrs. Butterworth}
1 - * Men. *\\
2 - And how are you this morning, Danny?\\
3 - Well, I didn't sleep very well last night, Alan.\\
4 - I had nightmares.\\
5 - Nightmares. Nightmares.\\
6 - I dreamed I ate a five-pound marshmallow.\\
7 - A five-pound marshmallow?\\
8 - Yeah, and when I woke up, my pillow was gone.\\
9 - Pillow was gone.\\
10 - Pillow. T-Tillow.\\
11 - Pil... tillow. Pftil...\\
12 - Alan?\\
13 - Yeah?\\
14 - You're starting to scare the crap out of me.\\
15 - Oh, oh, this?\\
16 - This is, uh, just a new hobby.\\
17 - Charlie, say hello to Danny O'Day.\\
18 - Howdy-do, Charlie.\\
19 - That's not a hobby. That's a cry for help.\\
20 - Oh, come on, Charlie, play along.\\
21 - So, Charlie, how did you sleep last night?\\
22 - With a woman, Alan.\\
23 - Something you need to do before this gets out of hand.\\
24 - Wow.\\
25 - He's got a stick where I've got your hand.\\
26 - Did you ask him if he wants to go to the movies with us?\\
27 - No. Why not?\\
28 - Because he's a ticking time bomb and we don't want to be\\
29 - in the car with him when he goes off.\\
30 - Come on, he's breaking my heart.\\
31 - Staying home all alone on a Friday night.\\
32 - Don't worry.\\
33 - You know how they say you can be alone\\
34 - but not lonely? Yeah.\\
35 - Well, Alan's kind of the opposite.\\
36 - He's always lonely but he's never alone.\\
37 - He's going through a tough time.\\
38 - Your brother should be surrounded\\
39 - by friends and family.\\
40 - My brother should be surrounded by a SWAT team.\\
41 - Please? For me?\\
42 - Chelsea, we agreed that you only get one of those a month.\\
43 - Are you sure you want to waste it on Alan?\\
44 - Thanks for letting me tag along with you.\\
45 - This is really sweet.\\
46 - We're thrilled you could join us.\\
47 - Right, Charlie?\\
48 - Yippee skippy.\\
49 - So have we picked a movie yet?\\
50 - Nope. Would you like to see\\
51 - La Poubelle et le Fromage at the Nuart?\\
52 - Would I?\\
53 - Who you calling "wood eye"?\\
54 - Big ears.\\
55 - Now, Danny, watch your mouth.\\
56 - Why? Yours is the one that's moving.\\
57 - (Chelsea and Alan laugh)\\
58 - Yippee skippy.\\
59 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *\\
60 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men * * Ooh\\
61 - * Men, men, men, men, manly men * * Ooh * Ooh\\

65 - * Ah. * Men. * Men.\\
66 - * Men. *\\
67 - (woman and man speaking French on movie screen)\\
68 - If she goes back to him after what he's done,\\
69 - I will never forgive her.\\
70 - She loves him.\\
71 - What choice does she have?\\
72 - Oh, she can return to her husband, the cheese maker.\\
73 - Listen, I'm going to hit the head.\\
74 - Let me know if any kind of a plot ever kicks in.\\
75 - He's not coming back, is he?\\
76 - They sell beer in the lobby? Yes.\\
77 - No.\\
78 - * Men. *\\
79 - (mimics rooster call)\\
80 - You're up early for a Saturday morning.\\
81 - Hence the cock-a-doodle-doo.\\
82 - (knocking) ALAN: Chelsea, it's 7:30.\\
83 - We got to get a move on.\\
84 - Oh, God, that's right. I forgot.\\
85 - Give me a few minutes to get dressed.\\
86 - No problem. I'll wait for you downstairs.\\
87 - What's going on?\\
88 - Your brother and I are going to the farmers market.\\
89 - Since when?\\
90 - We made plans last night.\\
91 - Last night when?\\
92 - In the movie theater,\\
93 - while you were sitting in the lobby drinking.\\
94 - Well, I wasn't going to go sit in the car\\
95 - with that scary dummy.\\
96 - I like mustard,\\
97 - and pickles,\\
98 - and ketchup,\\
99 - and mayonnaise.\\
100 - Mayonnaise.\\
101 - Mayonnaise.\\
102 - You and me need to talk.\\
103 - Howdy-do, Charlie.\\
104 - Get that ugly thing out of my face.\\
105 - That's what she said.\\
106 - Oh, Danny.\\
107 - Danny, you're horrible.\\
108 - My hand to God, Alan,\\
109 - I will wrap that dummy with meat\\
110 - and throw him in the ocean.\\
111 - Don't forget the mayonnaise.\\
112 - Ow!\\
113 - I'm okay.\\
114 - Why are you taking Chelsea to that farmers thing?\\
115 - Is there a problem?\\
116 - Yeah, there's a problem!\\
117 - You're ruining my Saturday.\\
118 - I'm sorry. Did you have plans for the day?\\
119 - Damn right I had plans.\\
120 - First, I was going to have sex with Chelsea.\\
121 - And then...\\
122 - Well, then I was going to go back to sleep.\\
123 - Well, you can still go back to sleep.\\
124 - Yeah, but without sex, it's a restless sleep.\\
125 - Fine, fine, I'll just go by myself.\\
126 - No, no, if you go without her now,\\
127 - then I'm the bad guy. So what do you want me to do?\\
128 - In the future, I want you to try to be\\
129 - more sensitive and considerate to other people's needs.\\
130 - Okay.\\
131 - Thank you.\\
132 - Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to join Chelsea\\
133 - in the shower and try to knock out a quick one.\\
134 - Oh, Danny...\\
135 - Sometimes he can be such a pig.\\
136 - Well, you know what happens to pigs.\\
137 - They get slaught...\\
138 - Danny, don't say it.\\
139 - Don't even think it.\\
140 - ...ered.\\
141 - * Men. *\\
142 - (sportscast playing on TV)\\
143 - What are you looking at?\\
144 - Nothin'.\\
145 - Oh, hey! Hey.\\
146 - What are you doing here?\\
147 - I thought you were spending the weekend\\
148 - with your mom and Herb.\\
149 - Yeah, I was supposed to, but Mom's got\\
150 - all those pregnancy hormones going.\\
151 - What did you do?\\
152 - One little fat joke.\\
153 - Took it badly, eh?\\
154 - Well, here I am.\\
155 - Where's Dad?\\
156 - He went out with Chelsea.\\
157 - You mean like a date?\\
158 - No, no, not a date.\\
159 - Good, 'cause that'd be weird.\\
160 - Yeah.\\
161 - I saw something like that on Jerry Springer once.\\
162 - Two brothers, one girl-- it got ugly.\\
163 - I'm sure it did.\\
164 - So what's Dad's dummy doing here?\\
165 - He pissed off his mother.\\
166 - Oh.\\
167 - Hey, I did that, too.\\
168 - * Men. *\\
169 - Okay, please take this kettle corn away from me.\\
170 - I can feel it going right to my behind.\\
171 - Oh, stop it.\\
172 - I wish my tush was as small as yours.\\
173 - Okay, first of all, you have a perfect heinie.\\
174 - And secondly, if you're worried about firmness,\\
175 - the secret is isometric glute crunches.\\
176 - Really? Yeah, you can do them anywhere, anytime.\\
177 - I'm doing them right now. See?\\
178 - Mailbox open, mailbox closed.\\
179 - Mailbox open,\\
180 - mailbox closed.\\
181 - Come on, try it with me.\\
182 - BOTH: Mailbox open, mailbox closed.\\
183 - Mailbox open,\\
184 - mailbox closed.\\
185 - Mailbox open, mailbox...\\
186 - You know, just once I'd like to walk in this room\\
187 - and not be freaked out.\\
188 - Alan was just showing me his butt exercises.\\
189 - Have him show you the one where he sticks his head up there.\\
190 - That's my favorite.\\
191 - Stop it.\\
192 - Now, go away, we're making dinner.\\
193 - It's kind of like a Kegel exercise, isn't it? Exactly.\\
194 - Except with the tush, not the hoo-ha.\\
195 - What up, homes?\\
196 - What are you doing?\\
197 - Enjoying the sunset, waiting on dinner.\\
198 - You're staying for dinner?\\
199 - I wasn't gonna,\\
200 - but your lovely fianc  e and her new gal pal insisted.\\
201 - Yeah, I've got to put a stop to that.\\
202 - What are you, nuts?\\
203 - This is the perfect setup for you.\\
204 - How do you figure?\\
205 - Do you like to go shopping?\\
206 - No. Zippy does.\\
207 - Do you like to watch chick flicks?\\
208 - No.\\
209 - Zippy does.\\
210 - Do you like to talk for hours about your feelings?\\
211 - No.\\
212 - Zippy do.\\
213 - Oh, right.\\
214 - He digs the trench, you lay the pipe.\\
215 - How could I not see this?\\
216 - Alan's not the competition. He's her gay friend.\\
217 - There you go. Your life is perfect.\\
218 - It is, isn't it?\\
219 - Yeah. Now, be an angel and get me another beer.\\
220 - Absolutely.\\
221 - (door opens)\\
222 - (door closes)\\
223 - Jiminy, I'm drunk.\\
224 - * Men. *\\
225 - (TV playing)\\
226 - Oh, I hate to do this to you.\\
227 - Uh, but using the existing "S" in the top row,\\
228 - with R-E before it\\
229 - and I-Z-I-N-G after it,\\
230 - hitting two triple word scores,\\
231 - and it's a bingo.\\
232 - "Resizing."\\
233 - 120 points.\\
234 - Oh, my God.\\
235 - You play for blood, don't you?\\
236 - Let me tell you something, Chelsea.\\
237 - When it comes to Scrabble,\\
238 - nice guys finish with a rack full of tiles.\\
239 - (turns off TV)\\
240 - (yawns)\\
241 - CHELSEA: What do you mean it's not a word?\\
242 - ALAN: I mean it's not a word. Try again.\\
243 - Hmm.\\
244 - Charlie horny.\\
245 - Another glass of wine?\\
246 - I would love one.\\
247 - (giggles) Now?\\
248 - But Alan and I are playing Scrabble.\\
249 - (chuckling): Well, I'm playing Scrabble.\\
250 - I don't know whatshe'sdoing.\\
251 - I'm improving, is what I'm doing.\\
252 - I want a rematch.\\
253 - Good night, Alan.\\
254 - But I just poured wine.\\
255 - Oh, thanks.\\
256 - And thanks for being such a good friend to Chelsea.\\
257 - You don't have to thank me.\\
258 - I like her, and we've got a lot in common.\\
259 - Yeah, whatever-- just keep it up,\\
260 - and I'll try to do the same.\\
261 - Kind of ruined the night.\\
262 - He's using you.\\
263 - (chuckling)\\
264 - I know, but what am I going to do?\\
265 - You could... kill him.\\
266 - Now, Danny, I-I could never do that.\\
267 - Don't worry, Alan.\\
268 - I can do it for you.\\
269 - * Men. *\\
270 - * Men. *\\
271 - Morning. Morning.\\
272 - Hope you're hungry-- I made pancakes.\\
273 - Oh, I'm starving. Can I help?\\
274 - Uh, sure, slice up some bananas\\
275 - and warm up the syrup.\\
276 - I'm on it.\\
277 - Sleep well?\\
278 - Yeah.\\
279 - I mean, when your brother finally let me go to sleep.\\
280 - (forced chuckling)\\
281 - Can I tell you a little secret?\\
282 - Sure.\\
283 - He's the best lover I've ever had.\\
284 - Oh, isn't that nice.\\
285 - Yeah, it's great,\\
286 - but sometimes he doesn't know when to quit.\\
287 - Have you tried pepper spray?\\
288 - No.\\
289 - But every once in a while, I actually have\\
290 - to give him a little smack on the top of his head.\\
291 - Yeah, I have the same problem with Jake\\
292 - when he eats spaghetti.\\
293 - I mean, obviously not the same problem.\\
294 - Jake's head is usually over here.\\
295 - Don't get me wrong.\\
296 - I'm not complaining, but it can be exhausting.\\
297 - I can imagine.\\
298 - Have you given Charlie enough attaboys?\\
299 - Attaboys?\\
300 - You know, like when you're training a dog.\\
301 - If you don't give them a lot of hugs\\
302 - and a treat every now and then, they're gonna chew up your rug.\\
303 - I mean, not your rug.\\
304 - Hey, how are those bananas coming?\\
305 - Morning.\\
306 - Morning. How'd you sleep?\\
307 - Good.\\
308 - When you finally let me. Hush.\\
309 - Alan's making pancakes.\\
310 - Can I pour you some coffee?\\
311 - I would love that.\\
312 - Good morning, Mrs. Butterworth.\\
313 - (forced chuckling)\\
314 - Ooh.\\
315 - Lakers-Spurs today.\\
316 - Charlie, you promised we'd go to the Van Gogh exhibit.\\
317 - I did?\\
318 - Yes.\\
319 - Wow, I don't remember that.\\
320 - You got to quit hitting me on the head so much.\\
321 - Yeah, I have heard that exhibit is supposed to be terrific.\\
322 - I've been dying to see it.\\
323 - Really?\\
324 - Then why don't we all go?\\
325 - I can't. I promised Jake we'd do something.\\
326 - Bring him along.\\
327 - What 14-year-old boy doesn't love a fine art museum?\\
328 - I think that's a great idea, Alan.\\
329 - You and Jake come with us.\\
330 - Well, if you don't think we'd be intruding.\\
331 - No. No, not at all.\\
332 - Okay, great.\\
333 - Well, save me some pancakes.\\
334 - I'm going to jump in the shower and get ready.\\
335 - Hurry! I want to get to the museum before it's too crowded.\\
336 - All right, here's the deal.\\
337 - You're gonna have to go to the museum without me.\\
338 - Why?\\
339 - I am about\\
340 - to get an acute case of intestinal distress.\\
341 - What? You know...\\
342 - the flapjack two-step.\\
343 - But there's nothing wrong with my pancakes.\\
344 - No, they're delightful.\\
345 - But the Lakers are playing the Spurs,\\
346 - and I'm not gonna miss it.\\
347 - So what? So you're just gonna use me to entertain your fianc  e\\
348 - while you stay home and watch a basketball game?\\
349 - Good. We're on the same page.\\
350 - Hey, did you ever stop to think\\
351 - that maybe I've got plans of my own?\\
352 - That I've got a life?\\
353 - That I'm not always at your beck and call?\\
354 - No.\\
355 - * Men. *\\
356 - (sportscast playing)\\
357 - You know, Berta, I thought\\
358 - when Alan moved in here I was being punished.\\
359 - You and me both.\\
360 - But come to find out, it was a blessing.\\
361 - With him in my life, I think\\
362 - I can actually make my relationship with Chelsea work.\\
363 - So you're really gonna go through with this marriage?\\
364 - Absolutely. I'm ready for the whole shebang.\\
365 - Kids, too?\\
366 - Well, it's certainly in the cards.\\
367 - Of course, I'd have to talk it over\\
368 - with Chelsea and Alan first.\\
369 - Wow, marriage and kids.\\
370 - I can't believe what I'm hearing.\\
371 - What can I say, Berta?\\
372 - He completes me.\\
373 - (chuckles)\\
374 - * Men. *\\
375 - (cell phone chimes)\\
376 - One second.\\
377 - (laughs)\\
378 - He's hilarious.\\
379 - Who?\\
380 - Your brother.\\
381 - L-O-L.\\
382 - (cell phone chimes)\\
383 - Let me just tell him we'll talk tomorrow.\\
384 - (laughing)\\
385 - He is out of control.\\
386 - What now?\\
387 - Hang on.\\
388 - "Don't let him chew up the rug."\\
389 - What does that mean?\\
390 - Nothing.\\
391 - Why would I chew up a rug?\\
392 - Not a rug, my... never mind.\\
393 - Okay, where were we?\\
394 - We were just about...\\
395 - (cell phone chimes)\\
396 - I'm sure he just wants to say "good night."\\
397 - (cell phone chimes)\\
398 - (cell phone chimes)\\
399 - (cell phone chimes)\\
400 - I'm sorry. Let me just make sure he's okay.\\
401 - Is he okay?\\
402 - Yeah.\\
403 - Good, good.\\
404 - Hey, I'm thirsty. Are you thirsty?\\
405 - No. Be right back.\\
406 - Hurry.\\
407 - Don't worry.\\
408 - This won't take but a minute.\\
409 - Oh, Charlie...\\
410 - Your penis is no match for my technology.\\
411 - Okay.\\
412 - I know what you're doing, now quit it.\\
413 - What I'm doing?\\
414 - Whatever do you mean?\\
415 - You're text-blocking me.\\
416 - Hey, I can't help it\\
417 - if Chelsea finds me witty and urbane.\\
418 - Keep it up and she's going to find you bloody and homeless.\\
419 - You don't scare me, Charlie.\\
420 - You need me to keep Chelsea off your back.\\
421 - That may be true, but I don't need\\
422 - him!\\
423 - Wait, just let him go, Charlie.\\
424 - This is just between you and me.\\
425 - Not anymore.\\
426 - Don't you dare hurt him!\\
427 - Well, now, that's entirely up to you.\\
428 - His tiny, wooden head is in your hands.\\
429 - Charlie?\\
430 - ALAN: Danny! (thudding)\\
431 - ALAN: Just let him go! CHARLIE: No!\\
432 - Charlie?\\
433 - (both grunting)\\
434 - What the hell are you doing?\\
435 - Nothing.\\
436 - Nothing.\\
437 - Nothing.\\
438 - * Men. *\\
439 - That's no way for a grown man to behave!\\
440 - CHARLIE: He started it!\\
441 - CHELSEA: I don't care who started it!\\
442 - You're the older brother.\\
443 - You set the example. Really?\\
444 - Then maybe I should move out...\\
445 - Boy, they're really going at it.\\
446 - Yeah. I'm glad we never fight.\\
447 - Me, too, Danny.\\
448 - 'Cause you don't ever want to make me angry.\\
449 - I-I-I know, Danny.\\
450 - Seriously.\\

22 - I thought that was you.\\
23 - What a nice surprise.\\
24 - Uh, didn't you move back to New York with your husband?\\
25 - We did, but then we split up, and I came back here.\\
26 - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.\\
27 - I mean, not that you moved back here,\\
28 - but that it didn't work out.\\
29 - So, how's Charlie doing?\\
30 - Oh, he's fine. Uh, actually,\\
31 - he's engaged, if you can believe that.\\
32 - You're kidding.\\
33 - No, no, she moved in and everything.\\
34 - Good for him. Hmm!\\

87 - That's it?\\
88 - Pretty much.\\
89 - How did she say it? What do you mean?\\
90 - I mean, was it perfunctory or was there subtext?\\
91 - "Perfunctory."\\
92 - That could be my rap name.\\
93 - MC Perfunctory.\\
94 - I don't know.\\
95 - Um...\\
96 - but I-I mentioned that you were engaged,\\
97 - and, uh, she seemed happy for you.\\
98 - You told her I was engaged?\\
99 - Why the hell would you do that?\\
100 - Because you are, in fact, engaged.\\
101 - And she seemed happy about that?\\
102 - Yeah, she said, "Good for him."\\
103 - How did she say it?\\
104 - Was it perfunctory?\\
105 - Or were there subtitles?\\
106 - I'm leaving.\\
107 - And yet the memory of him lingers on.\\
108 - Hey, Uncle Charlie. Yeah?\\
109 - Love you. (smacks lips)\\

111 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, so... so back to Mia.\\
112 - Oh, don't tell me\\
113 - you're still carrying a torch for her.\\
114 - No, I'm not carrying a torch for her.\\
115 - Why, do you think she's carrying a torch for me?\\
116 - Charlie, you are engaged to a wonderful woman.\\
117 - Just forget about Mia.\\
118 - I had forgotten about her.\\
119 - I had forgotten about her face...\\
120 - her eyes...\\
121 - her lips, her legs.\\
122 - Oh, God, those legs.\\
123 - You're the one who brought her up.\\
124 - Sorry.\\
125 - Look, I'm the last one to tell you\\
126 - you can't have feelings for an old girlfriend.\\
127 - I mean, I myself still have very strong feelings for Melissa.\\
128 - Who's Melissa?\\
129 - My receptionist.\\
130 - Oh, right.\\
131 - The one that caught you in bed with her mom.\\
132 - Uh, you're leaving out a lot\\
133 - of extenuating circumstances, but...\\
134 - yes, she caught me rubbing against her mother.\\
135 - And you want to compare that freak show\\
136 - to what Mia and I had?\\
137 - I almost married her.\\
138 - All I'm saying is,\\
139 - you can acknowledge your feelings for Mia\\
140 - while still moving forward with Chelsea.\\
141 - That's exactly what I intend to do.\\
142 - Good. It is good.\\
143 - You're thinking about sex with Mia, aren't you?\\
144 - You're thinking about sex with Melissa, aren't you?\\
145 - Trying to, but her mom keeps popping in.\\
146 - * Men. *\\
147 - (sportscast plays on TV)\\
148 - Okay, okay.\\
149 - I'm just going to come out and say it.\\
150 - Baseball was better with steroids.\\
151 - Mm-hmm.\\
152 - I mean, this guy\\
153 - is leading the league with 11 home runs.\\
154 - Back in Sammy Sosa's day, that was a slow weekend.\\
155 - Mm-hmm.\\
156 - Call me crazy, but...\\
157 - I think people would pay real money\\
158 - to see a meat-covered robot hit a ball 750 feet.\\
159 - Mmm...\\
160 - Okay, well...\\
161 - Sportscenter is over.\\
162 - Time for sex.\\
163 - Charlie, please, this report's due tomorrow.\\
164 - All right.\\
165 - I guess our relationship is getting to that mature,\\
166 - evolved stage they talk about.\\
167 - Guess so.\\
168 - Terrific.\\
169 - I hope I die soon.\\
170 - What?\\
171 - Love you.\\
172 - (toilet seat clanging)\\
173 - (loud splashing)\\
174 - Remember when you used to close the door\\
175 - and tried to hit the porcelain\\
176 - so I didn't have to hear you pee?\\
177 - Yeah, way back when we used to have sex after Sportscenter.\\
178 - (phone ringing)\\
179 - (loud splashing continues)\\
180 - Hello?\\
181 - Uh, hang on.\\
182 - Charlie, there's a woman named Mia on the phone.\\
183 - (thudding, urine splashing) Ow!\\
184 - (groans)\\
185 - Should I take a message?\\
186 - No, no, no.\\
187 - (toilet flushing)\\
188 - Hello.\\
189 - Oh, hey, Mia.\\
190 - What a surprise.\\
191 - Yeah, Alan mentioned he ran into you.\\
192 - Old friend.\\
193 - Yes, yes, you heard correctly.\\
194 - I am engaged.\\
195 - Thank you.\\
196 - Yes, that was her.\\
197 - Oh, she's terrific.\\
198 - And how are you?\\
199 - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.\\
200 - Well, there's plenty more fish in the sea.\\
201 - And I'm sure you'll get out there\\
202 - in that old dating pond and catch something.\\
203 - You know, a-a-a fish, not a disease.\\
204 - Anyway, thanks for the good wishes.\\
205 - Bye-bye.\\
206 - Okay, well, good night.\\
207 - Old friend, huh?\\
208 - Yeah.\\
209 - She heard I was engaged\\
210 - and wanted to congratulate me.\\
211 - Sweet kid.\\
212 - Is this the woman you almost married in Vegas\\
213 - a few years ago?\\
214 - Charlie?\\
215 - I'm thinking.\\
216 - Charlie.\\
217 - Who told you about that? Your brother.\\
218 - Oh, really?\\
219 - Did he tell you his last girlfriend\\
220 - caught him in bed with her mother?\\
221 - Yes, he did.\\
222 - What a dirtbag, huh?\\
223 - So, were you ever going to tell me about Mia?\\
224 - What's the point?\\
225 - Have you told me about every guy you've ever been with?\\
226 - Actually, I have.\\
227 - My boyfriend in high school,\\
228 - two guys in college and the man I married.\\
229 - That's it-- four?\\
230 - Back in your day, that was a slow weekend, right?\\
231 - It's not a competition, Chels.\\
232 - So, why do you think this Mia\\
233 - is calling you in the middle of the night?\\
234 - Honey, it was perfectly innocent.\\
235 - She just called\\
236 - to congratulate me on our engagement.\\
237 - No, she didn't.\\
238 - She called to see if you're happy.\\
239 - She wants to know if you're still available.\\
240 - Really, you think so?\\
241 - I mean...\\
242 - Really, you think so?\\
243 - Yes, I think so.\\
244 - The question is: are you happy?\\
245 - Are you available?\\
246 - Oh, come on, Chels.\\
247 - What kind of question is that?\\
248 - No, I'm not available, and I'm certainly not happy.\\
249 - You know what I mean.\\
250 - I hope so.\\
251 - Yep.\\
252 - I'm a happy and lucky man.\\
253 - Happy, happy, happy.\\
254 - Lucky, lucky, lucky.\\
255 - And wet.\\
256 - I'm kind of wet.\\
257 - * Men. *\\
258 - What you writing?\\
259 - A screenplay.\\
260 - Cool.\\
261 - Hey, I got a great idea for a movie if you want it.\\
262 - Thanks-- I'm okay.\\
263 - What is it?\\
264 - Okay. So there's this guy who's in an accident\\
265 - on the highway, where he hits like a moose or something.\\
266 - And he loses control of his car\\
267 - and crashes into a truck full of toxic waste.\\
268 - And when he wakes up in the hospital,\\
269 - he's part car and part animal.\\
270 - Car-nimal.\\
271 - Um... thanks, but I think I'll stick with my idea.\\
272 - Fine-- what's your idea?\\
273 - You really interested?\\
274 - Sure.\\
275 - Well, it's, uh... it's about a man,\\
276 - uh, who's at a crossroads in his life,\\
277 - uh, coming to terms with, uh, loss\\
278 - and... and mortality.\\
279 - Huh.\\
280 - You know what you could call it? What?\\
281 - Boring.\\
282 - Thank you.\\
283 - Rated G... A-Y.\\
284 - (doorbell rings)\\
285 - Hey, Charlie. Hey, Herb.\\
286 - I'm here to pick up Jake.\\
287 - Oh, come on in.\\
288 - Jake, time to get the hell out of my house!\\
289 - So, how's it going?\\
290 - Oh, pretty good.\\
291 - Baby's coming any day now.\\
292 - Judith's got that glow of motherhood.\\
293 - Gangway, I gotta freakin' pee again.\\
294 - Yeah, she's radiant.\\
295 - Hey, Herb.\\
296 - Jake's just finishing breakfast.\\
297 - Or he could be starting lunch.\\
298 - It's a fine line.\\
299 - Well, he is a growing boy.\\
300 - He's a growing pain in my ass.\\
301 - He says that with love.\\
302 - No, I say it with a dull, throbbing pain in my ass.\\
303 - JUDITH: Uh-oh.\\
304 - What's the matter? My water just broke.\\
305 - Are you sure?!\\
306 - (yelling)\\
307 - Yes, I'm sure.\\
308 - I ain't cleaning that up.\\
309 - * Men.\\
310 - * Men\\
311 - Boy, this brings back memories, huh?\\
312 - Shut up.\\
313 - Slipping in Judith's amniotic fluid.\\
314 - Guess this'll be pretty funny someday.\\
315 - It's pretty funny right now, Herb.\\
316 - Hello? A little help here!\\
317 - Ding! Ding! Ding!\\
318 - Hold your horses, I'm...\\
319 - Dr. Harper?\\
320 - Melissa, what are you doing here?\\
321 - I work here.\\
322 - I had to find another job after... You know.\\
323 - For the last time, I did not have sex with your mother!\\
324 - Excuse me, I'm having a baby here!\\
325 - Yeah, and I think I broke my ankle.\\
326 - Quit whining, Herb!\\
327 - Her doctor's on his way.\\
328 - The contractions are about eight minutes apart.\\
329 - Oh, well, let's get you to prenatal.\\
330 - I'll sign you in and have an orderly take you upstairs.\\
331 - No. No, No, no.\\
332 - I'm the father. I'll do it.\\
333 - Bad idea, Herb.\\
334 - I'm here, Judith. Everything's okay.\\
335 - Oh.\\
336 - JUDITH: Oh! Whoa!\\
337 - God.\\
338 - My arm!\\
339 - I'm coming, Judith!\\
340 - Stay down, champ.\\
341 - It's not your night.\\
342 - Oh, my freaking God!\\
343 - Now, you're not breathing.\\
344 - You got to remember to breathe.\\
345 - Good, good, good.\\
346 - Okay. Now, you're only two minutes apart.\\
347 - So we're in the homestretch here.\\
348 - Great.\\
349 - Boy...\\
350 - It seems like just yesterday we were at this same hospital\\
351 - waiting for little Jake to arrive.\\
352 - Uh-huh.\\
353 - I guess after pushing out his enormous head,\\
354 - this one will feel like spitting a watermelon seed.\\
355 - (moaning)\\
356 - So anyway, I really love my fianc  e,\\
357 - but I can't get this other girl out of my mind.\\
358 - I mean, she told my brother to give me her best.\\
359 - And let me tell ya, her best\\
360 - could curl your hair and make your ass whistle.\\
361 - Is that what you're here for?\\
362 - A whistling ass?\\
363 - No-no, no.\\
364 - There's a baby and some broken bones.\\
365 - Not important.\\
366 - The thing is,\\
367 - I know you can't expect to keep the passion\\
368 - of a new relationship going forever,\\
369 - but I kind of miss it.\\
370 - Maybe it's just that the grass\\
371 - always looks greener, you know?\\
372 - You see this cooler?\\
373 - Yeah.\\
374 - It's carrying two light beers,\\
375 - a half a ham sandwich and my thumb.\\
376 - So you'll excuse me if I lack\\
377 - a certain degree of interest in your romantic dilemma.\\
378 - You got beer?\\
379 - Oh, God! Oh, God! Now, focus on me.\\
380 - Remember your breathing.\\
381 - One, two, one,\\
382 - two, one... Dr. Harper?\\
383 - Melissa.\\
384 - I miss you.\\
385 - Oh, I miss you, too.\\
386 - Can we talk?\\
387 - Of course.\\
388 - Alan!\\
389 - You're fine. Just keep breathing.\\
390 - Hey, Charlie!\\
391 - Look at me.\\
392 - I'm half man, half machine.\\
393 - Kind of like Jake's movie idea.\\
394 - Car-nimal!\\
395 - It's okay, dude.\\
396 - I'm going to hang here for a while.\\
397 - I love that guy!\\
398 - What the hell did they give you?\\
399 - Oh, the good stuff.\\
400 - You could pull out every one of my teeth,\\
401 - I wouldn't even notice.\\
402 - They didn't, did they?\\
403 - You're fine.\\
404 - Okay, then.\\
405 - Guess we should get going.\\
406 - You drive, okay? I'm pretty buzzed.\\
407 - What about Judith?\\
408 - No, let's not bring her.\\
409 - She's a downer.\\
410 - No argument, but there is the baby.\\
411 - Oh, my God... the baby!\\
412 - Judith needs me.\\
413 - I must go to her.\\
414 - I'm coming, Judith!\\
415 - I'm coming!\\
416 - Hey, Charlie, how'd you get here so quick?\\
417 - Oh, I tried to forget you.\\
418 - To hate you.\\
419 - But I couldn't.\\
420 - Really?\\
421 - Most people don't have that problem.\\
422 - Beer and chips.\\
423 - This is turning out okay.\\
424 - Did you see where my friend went?\\
425 - He went hobbling down the hall, mumbling about some Judith.\\
426 - I better go warn the villagers.\\
427 - Good luck to you.\\
428 - Thanks. Oh, and hey.\\
429 - Good luck to you, too.\\
430 - (moaning, screaming)\\
431 - Oh.... God!\\
432 - Oh... oh...\\
433 - Oh...\\
434 - Oh, there you are.\\
435 - You seen Herb?\\
436 - No, I haven't seen Herb!\\
437 - Huh.\\
438 - Chips?\\
439 - No, I don't want any chips!\\
440 - Okay.\\
441 - I don't think you're supposed to have beer.\\
442 - Get out of here!\\
443 - No problem.\\
444 - Wait! Don't leave me!\\
445 - I need someone to coach me through my contractions.\\
446 - All right.\\
447 - (screaming)\\
448 - Uh...\\
449 - Way to go.\\
450 - HERB: Judith!\\
451 - I'm coming!\\
452 - See, I love Chelsea,\\
453 - but you know, there was a time I loved Mia.\\
454 - (screaming and panting)\\
455 - Breathe.\\
456 - All right, you're fully dilated.\\
457 - I think it's time to have this baby.\\
458 - Okay, well... good luck.\\
459 - Don't you dare leave me!\\
460 - (Judith screaming)\\
461 - Judith, I'm here! Oh!\\
462 - Whoopsie.\\
463 - Think I broke my nose.\\
464 - Three cheers for Demerol.\\
465 - Hip-hip!\\
466 - Hooray!\\
467 - * Men. *\\
468 - ALAN: Interior-- hospital delivery room.\\
469 - Day.\\
470 - An unconventionally handsome man looks down upon the baby\\
471 - that might be his, but which he can never claim.\\
472 - Suddenly, a flash of light appears in the sky\\
473 - and a flaming meteor plummets to the Earth.\\
474 - See, that's me holding the baby.\\
475 - That's me and the doctor.\\
476 - That's me, Judith and the baby.\\
477 - Who's that?\\
478 - Oh, that's just a guy who got his thumb sewn back on.\\
479 - I can't get over how into this baby you are.\\
480 - It was amazing.\\
481 - The miracle of birth.\\
482 - If Judith hadn't been there, it would've been perfect.\\
483 - So you're not against maybe having one of your own someday?\\
484 - I don't see why not.\\
485 - Turns out, I like babies.\\
486 - And as you know, I'm a longtime fan of intercourse.\\
487 - I know.\\
488 - I got to get back to work.\\
489 - Okay, I'll see you tonight.\\
490 - Love you. Love you, too.\\
491 - Bye, Alan. Bye.\\
492 - How's the screenplay coming?\\
493 - Great.\\
494 - Still on page one?\\
495 - Yeah, but now it really sizzles.\\
496 - MIA: Hi, Charlie.\\
497 - Mia.\\
498 - ALAN: To be continued...
