\subsection {Episode 01: The Skank Reflex Analysis}
1 - Scene: The Cafeteria\\
2 - Sheldon: It’s not what it looks like. It’s not what it looks like.\\
3 - Leonard: What are you grinding about?\\
4 - Sheldon: Penny’s brain teaser this morning. She and Koothrappali emerge from your bedroom. She is dishevelled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet. The sole clue, it’s not what it looks like.\\
5 - Leonard: Just let it go, Sheldon.\\
6 - Sheldon: If I could, I would, but I can’t, so I shan’t. Now, knowing Penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. But, since that’s what it looked like, we can rule that out. Let’s put on our thinking cap, shall we? (Mimes doing so) Raj is from India, a tropical country. Third World hygiene. Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms. Mm-hmm. The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait until the subject is asleep, and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air. (Leonard spits out food) Yes, just like that. Penny could have been inspecting Raj’s a**l region for parasites. Oh, boy. That’s a true blue friend.\\
7 - Leonard: They slept together, Sherlock.\\
8 - Sheldon: No, you weren’t listening. She said, it’s not what it looks like.\\
9 - Leonard: She lied.\\
10 - Sheldon: Oh. Well don’t I look silly sitting here wearing this?\\
11 - Credits sequence.\\
12 - Scene: The Cafeteria\\
13 - Howard: Hey.\\
14 - Raj: Hey.\\
15 - Leonard: Hey.\\
16 - Sheldon: Hey. Leonard, is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head?\\
17 - Leonard: No, I’m fine with it.\\
18 - Sheldon: That sounds like sarcasm, but I’m going to disregard it, because I have an agenda. Paintball. Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. Now, in order to function better as a fighting unit, I thought we should establish a chain of command. Now, it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you, but the question remains, by how much? Now, I don’t see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defence. But I also can’t be Sergeant Cooper, because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe. This might take some thought. As you were.\\
19 - Leonard: What the hell is wrong with you?\\
20 - Howard: Yeah, how could you do that?\\
21 - Raj: What is it to you?\\
22 - Howard: I got his back.\\
23 - Raj: Yeah, right. You’re just jealous because it turns out I’m Penny’s number two choice after Leonard.\\
24 - Howard: Hey, if I wasn’t engaged to Bernadette, that totally could have been me.\\
25 - Leonard: Please. Sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals.\\
26 - Raj: Why do you care so much? You’re dating my sister, and Penny and I are in love.\\
27 - Leonard and Howard together: What?\\
28 - Sheldon: Gentlemen, if I may interject, I’ve decided my rank will be captain. If it’s good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo, it’s good enough for me.\\
29 - Howard: You’re not in love with Penny.\\
30 - Raj: Yes, I am. The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love.\\
31 - Howard: Who?\\
32 - Raj: He’s the Hindu version of Cupid, but way better, because he rides a giant parrot.\\
33 - Leonard: Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee.\\
34 - Howard: I’m sorry. What?\\
35 - Raj: Rubbish. He’s talking rubbish.\\
36 - Leonard: Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.\\
37 - Raj: That could have been about anyone. Besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now I’m the dusky half of Koothrapenny.\\
38 - Sheldon: For the record, I do have genitals. They’re functional and aesthetically pleasing.\\
39 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. Penny has a bottle of wine. She can’t find a glass. Finds a measuring jug and uses that instead. There is a knock on the door.\\
40 - Penny: Coming. Yup, that’s good. Wine glasses should have handles.\\
41 - Amy: Keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake. Smart idea considering how trampy you get when you’ve had a few.\\
42 - Penny: You heard what I did?\\
43 - Amy: Well, I heard who you did.\\
44 - Penny: Oh, my God, I screwed up everything. I hurt Leonard, I hurt Raj, I mean, what is wrong with me? I feel like two totally different people, Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.\\
45 - Amy: Don’t be so hard on yourself. Do you know the story of Catherine the Great?\\
46 - Penny: No.\\
47 - Amy: She ruled Russia in the late seventeen hundreds, and one night, when she was feeling particularly randy, she used an intricate system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse.\\
48 - Penny: I’m… I’m sorry. What does this have to do with me?\\
49 - Amy: She engaged in interspecies hanky-panky, and people still call her great. I’m sure your reputation can survive you shagging a little Indian boy.\\
50 - Scene: Raj’s apartment. There is a knock on the door. He opens it.\\
51 - Bernadette: You jerk face! What did you tell Howard? Did you say there was something going on between us? Because he thinks there is. He’s completely freaking out!\\
52 - Raj: Please, come in.\\
53 - Bernadette: What the hell is wrong with you?\\
54 - Raj: Well, you were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me.\\
55 - Bernadette: I’m nice to everyone.\\
56 - Raj: I’m sorry.\\
57 - Bernadette: Damn right, you’re sorry. And you tell Howard there’s never been anything between us.\\
58 - Raj: I will. Hey, Bernadette?\\
59 - Bernadette: What?!\\
60 - Raj: Do you think I have a shot with Penny?\\
61 - Bernadette: Of course you do. You’re a cutie pie. Any girl would be lucky to have you.\\
62 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
63 - Penny: You know, I’ve done this before. In kindergarten, I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess, but by the time my class got out there, he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb. So what did I do? Hung upside down from the monkey bars, let all the boys see my underpants.\\
64 - Amy: You can’t blame yourself. When your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy, promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine. We neurobiologists refer to this as the skank reflex.\\
65 - Penny: You know what? Let’s get out of here.\\
66 - Amy: Where are we going?\\
67 - Penny: Somewhere where no one’s seen me naked. We may have to drive awhile. (Opens door. Sees Leonard and Sheldon. Slams it shut again.)\\
68 - Sheldon: Subtlety isn’t her strong suit, is it?\\
69 - Penny: Can I stay at your place for a few nights?\\
70 - Amy: Really? A best friend sleepover? Yay.\\
71 - Penny: Yeah, sure. Yay!\\
72 - Amy: We’ll make popcorn, stay up all night and I’ll teach you my secret language, Op.\\
73 - Penny: Sounds great.\\
74 - Amy: Nope. Sounds Gop Rop E A Top.\\
75 - Penny: Yeah, I’m gonna go pack a bag.\\
76 - Amy: No, you’re not. You’re gonna Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop.\\
77 - Scene: The apartment.\\
78 - Leonard: Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?\\
79 - Sheldon: Who said that? Leonard, I can hear your voice, but I can’t see you.\\
80 - Leonard: I’m not in the mood, Sheldon.\\
81 - Sheldon: Oh, there you are. Leonard, I know you’re upset about recent events, and I have someone here to help. (Showing laptop screen)\\
82 - Leonard: I don’t want to talk to Amy.\\
83 - Sheldon: No, it’s not Amy.\\
84 - Dr Hofstadter: Hello, dear.\\
85 - Leonard: You called my mother?\\
86 - Sheldon: Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?\\
87 - Dr Hofstadter: He’s been like that since he was a toddler. Look, Mommy, a butterfly. Maddening.\\
88 - Leonard: What’s going on? What do you want?\\
89 - Dr Hofstadter: Sheldon informed me that you’re experiencing an emotional upheaval, and I’m here to help.\\
90 - Leonard: That’s so nice.\\
91 - Dr Hofstadter: And we’re back to the obvious. Now, what’s up?\\
92 - Leonard: Well, uh, okay, um, I don’t want to get back together with Penny. We tried it, it was crazy, it didn’t work, but I can’t deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Raj’s sister Priya, who I’ve been going out with for eight months, is moving back to India. So I’m just completely confused and alone.\\
93 - Dr Hofstadter: I understand.\\
94 - Leonard: Got any advice?\\
95 - Dr Hofstadter: Yes. Buck up.\\
96 - Leonard: Excuse me. You’re a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development, and all you’ve got is buck up?\\
97 - Dr Hofstadter: Sorry. Buck up, sissy pants.\\
98 - Leonard: Thanks, Mother. I feel much better.\\
99 - Dr Hofstadter: If you need any more help from me, my books are available on Amazon. Logging off.\\
100 - Scene: Amy’s apartment. Amy is brushing Penny’s hair.\\
101 - Amy: Ninety-nine, one hundred. It’s like a waterfall of liquid gold. My turn.\\
102 - Penny: You know, I don’t even know what the point of me staying in L.A. is. I haven’t gotten a single acting job since I moved out here. The closest I came was last month, I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial.\\
103 - Amy: Oh, I could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids.\\
104 - Penny: I know, right? Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska.\\
105 - Amy: No, I can’t let you do that.\\
106 - Penny: Why not? (There is a knock on the door)\\
107 - Amy: For the first time ever, I have a thriving social life. And no pressure, but it kind of lives and dies with you.\\
108 - Raj: Hi, Amy. Can I talk to Penny?\\
109 - Amy: A guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door? I wish I could tell 13-year-old me it does get better.\\
110 - Penny: How did you know I was here?\\
111 - Raj: It’s all over her Facebook page.\\
112 - Amy: I’ll take your stuff to the bedroom and clear out a drawer.\\
113 - Penny: Thanks.\\
114 - Amy: No problem. Try and keep it in your pants, okay?\\
115 - Penny: So, hi. What’s up?\\
116 - Raj: I was wondering if you’re free Friday. They’re having a Totally ’80s Night at the Greek. Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.\\
117 - Penny: Oh. Gee, that’s really sweet, but the thing is…\\
118 - Raj: Aw, there’s a thing.\\
119 - Penny: Look, honey, I was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night. We should’ve never slept together. It’s what ruins friendships.\\
120 - Raj: You can’t ruin a friendship with s*x. That’s like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.\\
121 - Penny: Come here. Just listen to me. I want to go back to the way we were before. You know, friends. No sprinkles.\\
122 - Raj: Oh. All right.\\
123 - Penny: Thank you.\\
124 - Raj: Well, uh, as your friend, you might like to know that, um, we didn’t have s*x in the conventional sense.\\
125 - Penny: Oh, God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?\\
126 - Raj: No, no. After we got undressed and jumped in bed, you, you asked if I had protection.\\
127 - Penny: Oh, you did, didn’t you?\\
128 - Raj: Of course. I’m always packing. Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and, that was all she wrote.\\
129 - Penny: So, we didn’t actually…\\
130 - Raj: I did. It was beautiful.\\
131 - Penny: Oh!\\
132 - Raj: Penny, please, please promise me you won’t tell anybody about this.\\
133 - Penny: Of course I won’t. No, I won’t.\\
134 - Raj: Oh, good. Um, can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?\\
135 - Penny: Sure.\\
136 - Raj: Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all, I want to have your babies, and I was like, I’m too rock and roll to be tied down?\\
137 - Penny: No.\\
138 - Raj: Can I say I ruined you for white men?\\
139 - Penny: Also no.\\
140 - Raj: Okay, just the candle thing.\\
141 - Penny: Yeah.\\
142 - Raj: Cool. All right friend.\\
143 - Penny: Hmm.\\
144 - Raj: I’ll see you around.\\
145 - Penny: Okay. Raj, wait. Thank you for being my friend. (She hugs him.)\\
146 - Raj: Penny?\\
147 - Penny: Mm-hmm?\\
148 - Raj: It’s getting beautiful again.\\
149 - Scene: A shed on the paintball range.\\
150 - Sheldon: All right, this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle.\\
151 - Howard: I don’t see anything.\\
152 - Sheldon: Give it a second to load. Whenever you’re ready, AT&T! Okay, here we go. This is us here. To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department. According to their Twitter feed, they’re out of sunblock, which means they’ll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. That’s our edge. All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won’t know what hit them. All right, let’s move out.\\
153 - Leonard: Hang on, Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?\\
154 - Howard: Maybe he was too busy writing clumsy pen1s metaphors about my fiancee.\\
155 - Raj: Screw you. That was a beautifully written pen1s metaphor.\\
156 - Leonard: You know what, guys, I’m not in the mood for paintball. What do you say we just bag it?\\
157 - Howard: Fine with me.\\
158 - Raj: Sure, whatever.\\
159 - Sheldon: You can’t quit. That’s a court-martial offence. That’s punishable by… You can’t quit.\\
160 - Leonard: Sorry, Sheldon, it’s just not a good time for playing games.\\
161 - Sheldon: This is a game to you? Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game? Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?\\
162 - Leonard: Yes, no and no.\\
163 - Sheldon: Wait. I just want you all to know that I forgive you. This mutiny isn’t your fault, it’s mine. I haven’t earned these bars. Although what I lack in leadership, apparently I more than make up for in sewing.\\
164 - Howard: Let it go, Sheldon. I’ll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home.\\
165 - Sheldon: No. Jamba Juice is for heroes. And that’s what we’re going to be.\\
166 - Leonard: What are you doing?\\
167 - Sheldon: Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo. (Walks outside) Geology isn’t a real science! (Gets hit by countless paintball pellets)\\
168 - Howard: Damn those sons of bitches!\\
169 - Leonard: Let’s get ‘em!\\
170 - Sheldon: If there’s ever a Church of Sheldon, this will be when it started. Ow!\\
171 - Scene: The apartment.\\
172 - Leonard: I’d like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory, Captain Sheldon Cooper.\\
173 - Howard and Raj: Here, here.\\
174 - Sheldon: Excuse me. It’s Major Sheldon Cooper. With my last breath, I awarded myself a battlefield promotion. It’s kind of a big deal.\\
175 - Penny: Hi. You guys have a minute?\\
176 - Leonard: Uh, yeah, sure.\\
177 - Penny: Okay. Um. Well, I already talked to Raj, but I wanted to apologize to the rest of you for, you know, everything.\\
178 - Raj: Please, Penny, let me. We’ve decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you’re feeling blue or you’re in the shower.\\
179 - Penny: Hey, what you doing, Quick Draw?\\
180 - Raj: Sorry. Go on.\\
181 - Penny: Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know that I’ve been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion I have to stop kidding myself. I suck at acting. It’s time for me to move back to Nebraska.\\
182 - Leonard: You’re leaving?\\
183 - Penny: Yeah.\\
184 - Howard: What are you going to do in Nebraska?\\
185 - Penny: I don’t know, maybe teach acting. (Phone rings) Oh, sorry. Hold on. Hello?\\
186 - Leonard: Penny, Penny, listen, I hope you’re not doing this ’cause of you and me, because I have a girlfriend, and you’re a single woman.\\
187 - Penny: Shh! It’s my agent, it’s my agent. You’re kidding. Oh, my gosh. I can’t believe it! Really? Oh, I’m so excited, thank you, thank you so much. Okay, bye. I got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday.\\
188 - Sheldon: What about Nebraska?\\
189 - Penny: Oh, hell with Nebraska. I’m gonna be a star!\\
190 - Sheldon (to Leonard): Have you ever thought of teaching physics?\\
191 - Scene: The apartment. Penny’s ad is on the television. She is at a stables.\\
192 - Actress: Ready to ride?\\
193 - Penny (on screen): I don’t think so, Mom. Not today.\\
194 - Actress: Oh, sweetie. Haemorrhoids acting up again?\\
195 - Penny (on screen): You don’t know the half of it.\\
196 - Actress: Oh, yes, I do. Try a dab of this.\\
197 - Penny (on screen): Rose-scented Preparation-H for women?\\
198 - Actress: Now, the H is for Her.\\
199 - Leonard: I’m proud of you.\\
200 - Penny: Shh! Here comes my joke.\\
201 - Actress: How are you doing?\\
202 - Penny (on screen): Sittin’ pretty.
\subsection {Episode 02: The Infestation Hypothesis}
1 - Scene: The apartment. Leonard is laying out wine and napkins in front of his laptop.\\
2 - Sheldon: What are you doing?\\
3 - Leonard: Oh, uh, Priya’s calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date.\\
4 - Sheldon: It’s eight o’clock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?\\
5 - Leonard: Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast.\\
6 - Sheldon: All right, so technically it’s not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you’d open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?\\
7 - Leonard: That doesn’t sound like mocking.\\
8 - Sheldon: You didn’t let me finish. Dinfast (rolls eyes). Are those soy-based candles?\\
9 - Leonard: I don’t know. Why?\\
10 - Sheldon: Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast (rolls eyes).\\
11 - Leonard: Listen, I don’t want to be rude, but Priya’s gonna be calling any minute, so…\\
12 - Sheldon: Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs.\\
13 - Leonard: Yes, I’ve always admired that about you.\\
14 - Sheldon: As well you should. But I’m going to make an exception here.\\
15 - Leonard: Oh, good.\\
16 - Sheldon: Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby.\\
17 - Leonard: A hobby?\\
18 - Sheldon: Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.\\
19 - Leonard: You know, some people might say that it’s great that we’re trying to make things work long distance. They’d say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.\\
20 - Sheldon: When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.\\
21 - Leonard: You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?\\
22 - Sheldon: Don’t you like Amy?\\
23 - Leonard: Of course I like Amy.\\
24 - Sheldon: Well, there’s the difference. (Skype tone rings)\\
25 - Leonard: Excuse me, that’s Priya.\\
26 - Priya (on screen): Hi, Leonard.\\
27 - Leonard: Hey, honey.\\
28 - Priya: I miss you.\\
29 - Leonard: Oh, I miss you, too.\\
30 - Sheldon: I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.\\
31 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
32 - Sheldon: Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.\\
33 - Penny: Oh, it’s no problem. It’s actually kind of nice. You reading, me reading. We’re like an old married couple.\\
34 - Sheldon: If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.\\
35 - Penny: I don’t have iced tea and snickerdoodles.\\
36 - Sheldon: A good wife would go to the store.\\
37 - Penny: I want a divorce.\\
38 - Sheldon: Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair.\\
39 - Penny: It’s great, isn’t it?\\
40 - Sheldon: It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name.\\
41 - Penny: What name?\\
42 - Sheldon: Chair.\\
43 - Penny: Oh, all right, well, I’m glad you like it. I mean, I still can’t get over the fact someone just threw it away.\\
44 - Sheldon: What?\\
45 - Penny: Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.\\
46 - Sheldon (jumps up): Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. (Starts stripping off clothing)\\
47 - Penny: What is wrong?\\
48 - Sheldon: I’ve been sitting in garbage!\\
49 - Penny: Sheldon, take it easy.\\
50 - Sheldon: You take it easy! I need to use your shower.\\
51 - Penny: I went into this marriage with so much hope.\\
52 - Sheldon: There’s a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor. (Runs out of apartment).\\
53 - Credits sequence.\\
54 - Scene: Howard’s workshop. \\
55 - Raj: This is fun. I’ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.\\
56 - Howard: Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university back 175 grand.\\
57 - Leonard: That’s three minutes. Should we see what we got?\\
58 - Howard: Hang on.\\
59 - Raj: Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini.\\
60 - Howard: Hand me the tuna melt.\\
61 - Leonard: Yep.\\
62 - Howard: Thank you. How’s it going with the long-distance love affair?\\
63 - Leonard: Not easy, but we’re making it work.\\
64 - Howard: When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?\\
65 - Leonard: What?\\
66 - Howard: You know, the virtual pickle tickle. The digital bow-chicka-bow-bow.\\
67 - Raj: Come on, dude. This is my sister you’re talking about.\\
68 - Howard: Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it.\\
69 - Leonard: There’s no junk jiggling. We just talk.\\
70 - Howard: Are you insane? With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of s*x since the invention of the washcloth.\\
71 - Leonard: I can’t do that.\\
72 - Howard: Well, if you don’t, you’re gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books.\\
73 - Raj: How can you be so racist?\\
74 - Howard: Oh, come on, tell me I’m wrong.\\
75 - Sheldon (entering): Oh, Leonard, good. There you are. I need you to check my head for chair lice.\\
76 - Leonard: I did it last night, I’m not doing it again.\\
77 - Howard: Just his head, right?\\
78 - Leonard: I don’t want to talk about it. You didn’t catch bugs from Penny’s chair.\\
79 - Sheldon: Yes, I did. And now they’re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.\\
80 - Leonard: Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.\\
81 - Sheldon: Name one time I’ve ever done that.\\
82 - Leonard: How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you’d started growing again.\\
83 - Sheldon: I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills.\\
84 - Scene: Penny’s apartment door.\\
85 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\\
86 - Penny: Yello.\\
87 - Sheldon: You need to remove that chair from the building. It’s a health hazard.\\
88 - Penny: Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions.\\
89 - Sheldon: Really?\\
90 - Penny: Yeah. It’s cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.\\
91 - Sheldon: It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. That’s reassuring.\\
92 - Penny: Why don’t you give it a try, Sheldon?\\
93 - Sheldon: All right. It is a comfortable chair.\\
94 - Penny: Why don’t you just admit you overreacted?\\
95 - Sheldon: No, thank you. (Sees insect. More appear and swarm all over him. He jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. Jumps up and runs out to Penny’s apartment.\\
96 - Leonard: It’s like living with a Chihuahua.\\
97 - Sheldon (at Penny’s door): (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\\
98 - Penny: What’s up, buttercup?\\
99 - Sheldon: You have to get rid of the chair.\\
100 - Penny: Nope. (Closes door) \\
101 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\\
102 - Penny: What’s the word, hummingbird?\\
103 - Sheldon: For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death.\\
104 - Penny: No. (Closes door)\\
105 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\\
106 - Penny: What’s the gist, physicist?\\
107 - Sheldon: Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned. (Penny tries to close door) As a man with a keen sense of style, I must tell you, that chair does not work with the room. (Penny closes door). (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door and waves seat cushion at him. He screams and runs off. She closes door. He sneaks back) (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\\
108 - Scene: Leonard’s bedroom.\\
109 - Leonard: So, here we are. Back in bed together.\\
110 - Priya (on laptop screen): Yep, here we are.\\
111 - Leonard: Okay, so I, I, I guess I’ll just jump right in.\\
112 - Priya: All right.\\
113 - Leonard: Uh, you’re a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?\\
114 - Priya: What?\\
115 - Leonard: Not good?\\
116 - Priya: That’s terrible. Try again.\\
117 - Leonard: Okay. Uh, uh, you’re not naughty. Uh, you’re, you’re, you’re dirty. You’re, you’re a, a dirty girl?\\
118 - Priya: Oh, yes. Yes, I am.\\
119 - Leonard: Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. You’re a, you’re a, you’re a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!\\
120 - Priya: God, Leonard, stop talking.\\
121 - Leonard: Why don’t you just give me five minutes? I’ll Google how to do this. I’ll call you right back.\\
122 - Priya: Shh-shh-shh. Just be quiet and do what I tell you.\\
123 - Leonard: Okay, like usual. Good.\\
124 - Priya: Take off your shirt.\\
125 - Leonard: All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.\\
126 - Priya: I said be quiet.\\
127 - Leonard: Yes, ma’am.\\
128 - Priya: Now take off your shorts.\\
129 - Leonard: Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!\\
130 - Priya: Wonderful. Now I’ll take off my clothes.\\
131 - Leonard: Cool. (computer screen bugs out) Uh-oh!\\
132 - Priya: Here I am, baby. You miss these?\\
133 - Leonard: Oh, damn it!\\
134 - Priya: Oh, Leonard! Already?\\
135 - Leonard: No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It’s probably just buffering, just give it a second.\\
136 - Priya: Fine.\\
137 - Leonard: So, how are your mom and dad?\\
138 - Priya: Yeah, I really don’t want to talk about my parents now.\\
139 - Leonard: Yeah. Sure, sure.\\
140 - Sheldon (calling from outside): If your video’s frozen, try resetting the TCP/IP stack.\\
141 - Leonard: Oh! I didn’t even think of that. Thanks.\\
142 - Sheldon (still off): You’re welcome. Please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. I’m trying to stream a movie on Netflix in here.\\
143 - Scene: Amy’s apartment. Amy is playing a harp.\\
144 - Amy: Five, six, seven, eight. Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goes…\\
145 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.\\
146 - Amy: Oh… You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?\\
147 - Sheldon: Is not. Is not, is not.\\
148 - Amy: Denial. Denial, denial. Come in.\\
149 - Sheldon: Thank you.\\
150 - Amy: Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?\\
151 - Sheldon: No.\\
152 - Amy: How about the theme song to the classic television show Diff’rent Strokes? Now the world don’t move to the beat…\\
153 - Sheldon: No.\\
154 - Amy: Well, that’s every song I know. What’s up?\\
155 - Sheldon: You’re good friends with Penny, right?\\
156 - Amy: Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. Go on.\\
157 - Sheldon: I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.\\
158 - Amy: For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?\\
159 - Sheldon: Cholera is water-borne. You’re mocking me.\\
160 - Amy: Yes, I am.\\
161 - Sheldon: Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.\\
162 - Amy: Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn’t mean I have to participate.\\
163 - Sheldon: All right, name your price.\\
164 - Amy: Kiss me where I’ve never been kissed before.\\
165 - Sheldon: You mean like Salt Lake City?\\
166 - Amy: Never mind. I’ll talk to Penny.\\
167 - Sheldon: Thank you.\\
168 - Amy: Will you listen to me play my harp now?\\
169 - Sheldon: No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I’m going to experience an episode from my past. (Amy plays glissando) I’m sorry, Mommy. Don’t be mad at me. Don’t do that!\\
170 - Scene: Howard’s workshop. \\
171 - Leonard: I don’t know about this, Howard.\\
172 - Howard: What? You’re having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. This is your answer. There are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. You have one, Priya has one in India. When you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what you’re doing to hers. See? Internet kissing. (Howard kisses device) Give it a try.\\
173 - Leonard: I don’t think so.\\
174 - Raj: I’ll try it. Like this?\\
175 - Howard: Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor.\\
176 - Raj: Like this?\\
177 - Howard: Close. Really French it.\\
178 - Raj: Better?\\
179 - Howard: Yeah, you got it, you got it.\\
180 - Raj: I’m impressed. This is very lifelike.\\
181 - Howard: Whoa! You just bit my tongue!\\
182 - Raj: I, I nibbled. I was being playful.\\
183 - Howard: Why do you have to make everything weird?\\
184 - Raj: Sorry. Better?\\
185 - Howard: Oh, yeah.\\
186 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. \\
187 - Penny: Pretty cool, huh? Probably would cost, like, two hundred bucks in a store.\\
188 - Amy: I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.\\
189 - Penny: You’re kidding.\\
190 - Amy: Everything except bra and panties. And they’re a leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria.\\
191 - Penny: And now me.\\
192 - Amy: I just have one question about the chair.\\
193 - Penny: And what’s that?\\
194 - Amy: Aren’t you worried about it being unhygienic?\\
195 - Penny: No, it’s completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this.\\
196 - Amy: No, he didn’t.\\
197 - Penny: Really?\\
198 - Amy: Yes, he did. He absolutely did.\\
199 - Penny: My God, Amy, that’s really crappy of you.\\
200 - Amy: It is?\\
201 - Penny: Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I thought you were my friend.\\
202 - Amy: No, I am your friend. Please don’t be mad at me.\\
203 - Penny: I can’t even believe this. You know, maybe you should just go.\\
204 - Amy: No, no, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I take it all back. Look. I’m, uh, I’m sitting in your chair. There’s nothing wrong with it. It’s a great chair. Please let me continue to be part of your world. Ow!\\
205 - Penny: What’s wrong?\\
206 - Amy: Something in the chair’s biting my tushy. It’s not important. Ow!\\
207 - Penny: Wait. Get up, get up! (She does. Something is moving in the seat cushion. They both run out of the apartment screaming.) Swear you won’t tell Sheldon what happened!\\
208 - Amy (between screams): I swear! Can I tell my doctor? I’m probably gonna need shots!\\
209 - Penny (also still screaming): Yeah, sure!\\
210 - Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. \\
211 - Leonard: Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out.\\
212 - Priya (on screen): Oh, Leonard, listen…\\
213 - Leonard: No, you listen. You’re my woman, and I’m gonna make you feel things you have never felt before.\\
214 - Priya: Leonard…\\
215 - Leonard: That’s right, say my name, and beg me for more, ’cause, I’m gonna give it to you.\\
216 - Priya: My parents are here.\\
217 - Dr Koothrappali: Hello, Leonard, if I may also say your name.\\
218 - Scene: The street outside the apartment block.\\
219 - Howard: Check it out. Free chair.\\
220 - Raj: Yeah. Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment, I wouldn’t wind up sitting on the floor all the time.\\
221 - Howard: On three?\\
222 - Together: Three!\\
223 - Raj: What kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?
\subsection {Episode 03: The Pulled Groin Extrapolation}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Leonard: Who wants the last dumpling?\\
3 - Penny: Ooh, me.\\
4 - Sheldon: Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group.\\
5 - Penny: Thank you all for this high honour.\\
6 - Sheldon: I’ve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating.\\
7 - Howard: All right, honey, if we’re gonna make the movie, we should go. (Raj stands) This may be hard for you to hear, but when I say honey, I mean my fiancée. (Raj whispers to him) Yeah, well, now it means her.\\
8 - Bernadette: It’s okay if he wants to come.\\
9 - Howard: Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.\\
10 - Penny: All right, I got to go to work. I’ll walk down with you.\\
11 - Sheldon: Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?\\
12 - Howard: Neither of them are close.\\
13 - Sheldon: Oh, well, then I guess it doesn’t matter which one of you drives me. Let’s play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer’s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt.\\
14 - Penny: Okay, I’m not driving him.\\
15 - Sheldon: No, Penny, don’t give up, you can get this.\\
16 - Leonard: Aren’t you going with Sheldon?\\
17 - Amy: No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele.\\
18 - Leonard: Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so…\\
19 - Amy: I can’t imagine that would disturb me. Carry on.\\
20 - Leonard: Okay. Wouldn’t you be more comfortable at home?\\
21 - Amy: Not really, no.\\
22 - Leonard: All righty then. Guess I’ll just get started.\\
23 - Amy: Leonard, please. I don’t need the running commentary.\\
24 - Credits sequence.\\
25 - Scene: The apartment. Amy is staring into space.\\
26 - Leonard: Amy?\\
27 - Amy: Yo.\\
28 - Leonard: You okay?\\
29 - Amy: Oh, sure.\\
30 - Leonard: I thought you were reading.\\
31 - Amy: I was. Now I’m thinking about what I read. You all right, Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable.\\
32 - Leonard: I, I’m fine.\\
33 - Amy: Should I go? I’ve been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.\\
34 - Leonard: What, who told you that?\\
35 - Amy: Well, most recently my gynaecologist.\\
36 - Leonard: Well, you stay as long as you’d like.\\
37 - Amy: I’m glad to hear you say that, because I’m having a wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist.\\
38 - Scene: Raj’s car.\\
39 - Bernadette: What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?\\
40 - Sheldon: Oh, I’m not buying anything. They’re having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic.\\
41 - Howard: Which side do you come down on?\\
42 - Sheldon: I’ll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, I’m going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it’s O-gauge or no gauge.\\
43 - Howard: Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?\\
44 - Bernadette: That’s pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother’s house.\\
45 - Howard: First of all, they’re not tricks, they’re illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, they’re all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes.\\
46 - Bernadette: Why would I keep clothes at your mother’s house?\\
47 - Howard: Well, don’t think of it that way. Once we move in, it’ll be our house.\\
48 - Bernadette: Is she moving out?\\
49 - Howard: Why would she move out? It’s her house.\\
50 - Bernadette: Hang on. You seriously think I’m going to live with your mother?\\
51 - Sheldon: Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that’s exactly what he thinks.\\
52 - Howard: Why not? It’s a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom’s there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin.\\
53 - Bernadette: I’m not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever.\\
54 - Howard: Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues.\\
55 - Bernadette: Raj, take me home.\\
56 - Howard: Don’t listen to her. Go to the movie theatre.\\
57 - Bernadette: Take me home now.\\
58 - Howard: Movie theatre.\\
59 - Raj: Mmmmmm.\\
60 - Sheldon: Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don’t care what you people do.\\
61 - Scene: The apartment.\\
62 - Amy: How was your shower?\\
63 - Leonard: It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?\\
64 - Amy: Oh, I’m up all night. I’m like a possum. Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?\\
65 - Leonard: Not really. Is that my yearbook?\\
66 - Amy: Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you’re really good at science. Maybe one day you’ll come up with a cure for being a dork.\\
67 - Leonard: Well, it wasn’t spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that.\\
68 - Amy: If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother.\\
69 - Leonard: Aw.\\
70 - Amy: Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom.\\
71 - Sheldon (entering): Well, you can add Jerry’s Junction to the list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again.\\
72 - Leonard: Rough night, Casey Jones?\\
73 - Sheldon: You don’t know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.\\
74 - Leonard: What’s in the bag?\\
75 - Sheldon: I don’t want to talk about it. But it’s not a spine,I’ll tell you that.\\
76 - Amy: Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do this again sometime.\\
77 - Leonard: Ah, sure. That’d be nice.\\
78 - Amy: Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They’re kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.\\
79 - Leonard: Wouldn’t you rather bring Sheldon?\\
80 - Amy: I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time.\\
81 - Sheldon: Not my fault. You said there’d be other scientists there my age.\\
82 - Amy: Doesn’t matter. You’re out, he’s in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change.\\
83 - Sheldon: Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding.\\
84 - Scene: Outside Howard’s house. Amy rings the bell.\\
85 - Howard (off): I’ll get it!\\
86 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Could you get it?\\
87 - Howard (off): I said I’m getting it!\\
88 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Fine, I’ll get it!\\
89 - Howard: I got it! Oh, hi.\\
90 - Bernadette: Hey. I don’t want to fight. I was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.\\
91 - Howard: Yeah, well, I’m sorry I didn’t run it by you first.\\
92 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): I don’t know who you’re talking to, but in or out! We don’t need bugs!\\
93 - Howard: The bugs only come here because you’re their queen! Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. Stay here for a weekend, see what it’s like.\\
94 - Bernadette: And your mom would be okay with that?\\
95 - Howard: Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?\\
96 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Hey, if she’s willing to give the milk away for free, who am I to say no?\\
97 - Howard: See? She’s good with it.\\
98 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Frankly, after all your sleepovers with the little brown boy, a girl is a big relief!\\
99 - Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is playing with his train set.\\
100 - Sheldon: All this years, I’ve been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun.\\
101 - Penny: You’re a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?\\
102 - Amy: Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?\\
103 - Penny: Really? For a wedding?\\
104 - Amy: Perhaps you’re right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.\\
105 - Leonard: Ready.\\
106 - Penny: Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.\\
107 - Sheldon: Better than James Bond, because he’s tinier.\\
108 - Amy: I got you this to give to me.\\
109 - Penny: Oh, sweetie, guests don’t normally wear corsages to a wedding. That’s more of a prom thing.\\
110 - Amy: I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs.\\
111 - Penny: Put the corsage on her.\\
112 - Leonard: Amy, this is for you.\\
113 - Amy: When you’re done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.\\
114 - Sheldon: All aboard! Woo-woo! It’s official. I’m an H-O trainiac.\\
115 - Scene: Howard’s bedroom.\\
116 - Howard: So, dinner went nice.\\
117 - Bernadette: Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?\\
118 - Howard: Only when it’s fatty. Well, don’t be jealous, babe. Someday you’ll get to cut it for me.\\
119 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Bernadette! I found the extra head for the Waterpik if you want to use it!\\
120 - Bernadette: I’m okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.\\
121 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): You sure? I just squirted half a brisket outta my teeth!\\
122 - Howard: Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?\\
123 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, I know what that means! Hubba-hubba!\\
124 - Bernadette: Oh, God.\\
125 - Howard: Relax, it’ll be fine.\\
126 - Bernadette: Okay.\\
127 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Let me know when you’re done canoodling! Mommy needs a foot rub!\\
128 - Scene: The wedding.\\
129 - Amy: Would you like to dance?\\
130 - Leonard: No, thank you. I’m really not much of a dancer.\\
131 - Amy: You’re not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either.\\
132 - Leonard: I’m sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.\\
133 - Amy: Why shouldn’t they be? They have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures, we’d stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm.\\
134 - Leonard: That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so…\\
135 - Amy: Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a delight here. And you’re not holding up your end of the evening.\\
136 - Leonard: Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away.\\
137 - Amy: I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who’s playing with a model train right now, you don’t hear me bitching about it. Leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you.\\
138 - Leonard: I’m not moody. I’m fun.\\
139 - Amy: You have any evidence to support that statement?\\
140 - Leonard: Well, hey, I’m just as much fun as you are.\\
141 - Amy: Really? Are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? I am.\\
142 - Leonard: Okay, fine, what do you suggest?\\
143 - Amy: We just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and you’re sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. Why don’t we head outon the dance floor and see if I can sweat through these dress shields.\\
144 - Leonard: Once again, I, I’m really not much of a dancer.\\
145 - Amy: Don’t worry, I’ll lead. (They do the Birdie Song dance)\\
146 - Scene: Howard’s bedroom. Howard is playing with a lightsabre.\\
147 - Amy: Howard?\\
148 - Howard: Ready for bed?\\
149 - Bernadette: No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother’s been in the bathroom for, like, an hour.\\
150 - Howard: Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonight’s not your night!\\
151 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): You don’t know that! I just sat down!\\
152 - Howard: Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!\\
153 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): She can come in and brush her teeth! I’m not embarrassed!\\
154 - Howard: Problem solved.\\
155 - Bernadette: No, it’s not. I’m not going in there.\\
156 - Howard: Oh, come on, honey. She’s just sitting in there reading a magazine. You can’t see anything. I go in all the time.\\
157 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Ha! The eagle has landed!\\
158 - Howard: And we have splashdown. Wait here, I’m gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love.\\
159 - Scene: The stairwell. Amy is helping Leonard up the stairs.\\
160 - Amy: There we go, last floor.\\
161 - Leonard: I just can’t figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped.\\
162 - Amy: The hokey pokey is a young man’s game.\\
163 - Leonard: I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it’s okay to have fun once in a while.\\
164 - Amy: You’re welcome.\\
165 - Leonard: And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.\\
166 - Amy: I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely.\\
167 - Leonard: Well, okay. Again, thank you.\\
168 - Amy: And again, you’re welcome.\\
169 - Leonard: Want to come in, have a cup of tea?\\
170 - Amy: No, thanks. I’m gonna head home.\\
171 - Leonard: Okay. Well, good night.\\
172 - Amy: Good night. (Heads across corridor and knocks on Penny’s door)\\
173 - Penny: Ames, hi. How was the wedding?\\
174 - Amy: Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.\\
175 - Penny: Come in, let’s talk. Do you want a glass of wine?\\
176 - Amy: Wine is one of the reasons I’m in this fix. That and this dang pelvis.\\
177 - Penny: Okay, I’m sorry, what exactly happened?\\
178 - Amy: The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let’s face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.\\
179 - Penny: Oh, God, did he make a move on you?\\
180 - Amy: No, but it’s only a matter of time. How could I have not seen this coming? Now I’m gonna have to break the little sad sack’s heart.\\
181 - Penny: Yeah, I’m sure he’ll be okay.\\
182 - Amy: Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesn’t get my motor running.\\
183 - Penny: So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?\\
184 - Amy: No. I’ll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, I’ll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. I mean, frankly, you’ve got a better shot than he does.\\
185 - Scene: The apartment.\\
186 - Sheldon: Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive. Half the size of H-O. Look, it fits in my mouth.\\
187 - Leonard: Sounds like you had a great night.\\
188 - Sheldon: I did. How was yours?\\
189 - Leonard: Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.\\
190 - Sheldon: What exactly do you mean by that?\\
191 - Leonard: Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin’s a little worse for wear. (Sheldon hits him) Ow! Why did you do that?\\
192 - Sheldon: To send a message. She is not for you.\\
193 - Leonard: What?\\
194 - Sheldon: Not for you!\\
195 - Scene: Howard’s bedroom.\\
196 - Bernadette: Good morning, handsome.\\
197 - Howard: Morning, Mom.\\
198 - Bernadette: It’s me.\\
199 - Howard: Yes, it is, and you’re so pretty in the morning.\\
200 - Bernadette: Your mom and I made you breakfast.\\
201 - Howard: Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?\\
202 - Bernadette: Yeah, I guess. We’re very different people, Howard, so communication’s a little tricky.\\
203 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Does he like the pancakes?!\\
204 - Bernadette (in a similar voice): He didn’t try them yet!\\
205 - Howard: Is there any butter?\\
206 - Bernadette: It’s butter-flavoured syrup.\\
207 - Howard: Oh.\\
208 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): So, what’s the word?\\
209 - Bernadette: He wants butter!\\
210 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): It’s butter-flavoured syrup\\
211 - Bernadette: I just told him that!\\
212 - Howard: I don’t need any butter.\\
213 - Bernadette: If you want butter, I’ll get you butter.\\
214 - Howard: Well, I guess I’ll cut these by myself.
\subsection {Episode 04: The Wiggly Finger Catalyst}
1 - cene: The apartment.\\
2 - Sheldon: The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. You manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre. What do you do?\\
3 - Howard: I say, hey Ma, what’s for dinner?”\\
4 - Sheldon: Seventeen. The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. By the by, I liked it, too.\\
5 - Leonard: Hey, how go the wedding plans, Howard?\\
6 - Howard: Great. We spent five hours last night at Macy’s registering for gifts. Looks like I’m finally going to have that darling little earthenware asparagus dish I’ve always wanted.\\
7 - Leonard: See, this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away. I can spend my nights doing whatever I want.\\
8 - Howard: You mean like playing nerd games with us and then taking a suspiciously long shower?\\
9 - Leonard: Maybe. We enter the dungeon.\\
10 - Sheldon: You see a dragon.\\
11 - Howard: Really? So we’re playing Dungeons and Dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? Isn’t that a little on the nose?\\
12 - Sheldon: When you play Chutes and Ladders, do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?\\
13 - Leonard: Are you gonna eat that whole pie?\\
14 - Raj: Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?\\
15 - Leonard: Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?\\
16 - Raj: No, it’s just that everybody’s got someone. Sheldon’s with Amy, Howard’s getting married, you’re dating my sister.\\
17 - Leonard: Now that Howard’s getting married, maybe he’ll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you.\\
18 - Raj: You know who I blame for my loneliness? The United States of America. Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.\\
19 - Howard: Eat another pie, you’ll have your own bazongas.\\
20 - Raj: That’s cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips.\\
21 - Sheldon: Gentlemen, please focus. You’re facing a fire-breathing dragon.\\
22 - Raj: I don’t know if I want to play anymore.\\
23 - Sheldon: Because you don’t have a girlfriend? Well, good Lord, if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons and Dragons, this game’s in serious trouble.\\
24 - Credits sequence.\\
25 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
26 - Amy: Now, I assume we use this same wax later on to neaten up each other’s bikini regions.\\
27 - Penny: Yeah, my bikini region is fine.\\
28 - Amy: Who’s shocked? I’m not. So, Bernadette, how’s the wedding planning going? And I’m not asking as a prospective bridesmaid. Pick me! Pick me!\\
29 - Bernadette: We went cake-tasting yesterday. Raj came along. He cried and ate half the samples.\\
30 - Penny: Oh, the poor guy’s so lonely. We should set him up with someone.\\
31 - Bernadette: You know, I met a really cute girl at work. She’s married to a guy in one of our drug trials.\\
32 - Penny: Well, hello? She’s married.\\
33 - Bernadette: Yeah, but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure, and a little birdie told me he’s in the placebo group.\\
34 - Penny: Okay, so future grief-stricken widow is the one to beat.\\
35 - Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.\\
36 - Leonard: Are we ready to order?\\
37 - Sheldon: One moment. I’m conducting an experiment.\\
38 - Howard: With Dungeons and Dragons dice?\\
39 - Sheldon: Yes. From here on in, I’ve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best, enlighten and amaze. Page 14, item seven.\\
40 - Howard: So, what’s for dinner?\\
41 - Sheldon: A side of corn succotash. Hmm. Interesting.\\
42 - Penny: Um, Howard, can I see you for a minute, please?\\
43 - Howard: Uh, I don’t want to show any more of your friends how I can fit in the booster seats.\\
44 - Penny: Uh, no, that’s not it. Just come with me, please.\\
45 - Sheldon: Let’s see what I’ll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas.\\
46 - Leonard: Do you really want that?\\
47 - Sheldon: That’s the great thing. It doesn’t matter. My mind is freed up to think about more important things.\\
48 - Raj: What’s it thinking about now?\\
49 - Sheldon: Hamburgers and lemonade.\\
50 - Penny: Um, Raj, there’s someone I want you to meet. This is my friend Emily. I know her from my spin class. Raj, relax. She can’t hear you. She’s deaf.\\
51 - Howard (signing): Emily, this is our friend Raj.\\
52 - Penny: Oh! Look at you guys just hitting it off. I am so good.\\
53 - Raj: Hi.\\
54 - Howard: She says it’s nice to meet you.\\
55 - Raj: Does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically?\\
56 - Howard: Raj says it’s nice to meet you, too. She says she has to go back to her family, but Penny has her number if you want to text her and get together.\\
57 - Raj: Okay, I’m going to play it cool. Tell her, maybe. Whatever, babe.\\
58 - Howard: He’ll text you.\\
59 - Raj: Ah, look at that. I have a date. I love America again.\\
60 - Sheldon: And now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. Bam! That’s what I’m talking about!\\
61 - Scene: A coffee shop.\\
62 - Raj: Okay, as soon as she gets here, so she knows I’m cool with it, I’m going to make a joke about her being deaf. I was thinking, hey, did you hear the one about…? Oh, no, I bet you didn’t.\\
63 - Howard: Maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.\\
64 - Raj: Oh, she’s here.\\
65 - Howard: No joke. Oh, she says she’s sorry she’s late.\\
66 - Raj: Tell her it doesn’t matter. Tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens.\\
67 - Howard: Really? That’s the first thing you want to say?\\
68 - Raj: I worked on it all night. Use it.\\
69 - Howard: Look, I don’t know the sign for opalescent.\\
70 - Raj: Then spell it.\\
71 - Howard: I don’t know how to spell it.\\
72 - Raj: You’re blowing this for me!\\
73 - Howard: He likes your eyes.\\
74 - Raj: You’re making me sound like a caveman.\\
75 - Howard: She says, thank you, you have nice eyes, too.”\\
76 - Raj: Really? Ask her how many children she wants, and whatever number she says, say, me too.\\
77 - Howard: No.\\
78 - Raj: Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice like James Earl Jones.\\
79 - Howard: She doesn’t know what James Earl Jones sounds like.\\
80 - Raj: Great. Then she won’t know I’m lying.\\
81 - Scene: The same, later.\\
82 - Raj: Let’s see, what else can I tell you about me that would make you like me? Ooh, I love music. Do you love music?\\
83 - Howard: You really want to ask her that?\\
84 - Raj: You’re right. Everyone loves music.\\
85 - Howard: She says, do you play an instrument?\\
86 - Raj: No, but when I was six years old, I tried to start a boy band called Frankie Goes to Bollywood. But I couldn’t get any other boys to join, so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. Wait, when you sign servants, don’t sign it like I’m bragging. Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of, that’s right, I had servants.\\
87 - Howard: Do you hear yourself\\
88 - Raj: Yes, but she doesn’t. So get signing, hand monkey.\\
89 - Scene: The same, later.\\
90 - Howard (translating for Emily): I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus every day. And then on Christmas morning, under the tree is a little puppy with a red ribbon.\\
91 - Raj: What are you doing?\\
92 - Howard: Texting Bernadette that I’m gonna be late.\\
93 - Raj: Dude, what is she saying?\\
94 - Howard: It’s a funny story about a puppy. Just smile and laugh. Quick, quick, stop smiling.\\
95 - Raj: What? Why?\\
96 - Howard: The puppy died, it choked on a doll head. Sad face, sad face!\\
97 - Scene: Outside the coffee shop.\\
98 - Raj: It’s a little hard to see with the city lights, but that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia. And she was the mother of Andromeda who’s over there.\\
99 - Howard: Look, pretty stars. This is her car. She hopes she can see you again sometime.\\
100 - Raj: Good, good. Oh, boy, help me out here. Does she want me to kiss her or not?\\
101 - Howard: I speak sign language, I don’t read minds.\\
102 - Raj: If you were me, would you kiss her?\\
103 - Howard: Yeah, but I’m a make out king. (She kisses Raj and gets into car)\\
104 - Raj: I was so smooth on that date.\\
105 - Howard: You? I made you smooth. You were an idiot.\\
106 - Raj: Whatever, dude. She kissed me.\\
107 - Howard: It might’ve been on your lips, but it was my kiss.\\
108 - Raj: Oh, fine. Let’s agree she kissed both of us.\\
109 - Howard: Okay.\\
110 - Scene: The apartment. \\
111 - Penny: Mustache is looking good there, Sheldon.\\
112 - Sheldon: Don’t thank me. Thank the dice. They told me what percentage of my face to shave.\\
113 - Howard: Why are you still doing this?\\
114 - Sheldon: Because it’s working. In the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, I’ve co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and I’m close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle.\\
115 - Leonard: You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants.\\
116 - Sheldon: The dice giveth and the dice taketh away.\\
117 - Penny: Is Raj out with Emily again?\\
118 - Leonard: Yeah, every night for the last month.\\
119 - Penny: Wow, can’t believe he has a girlfriend.\\
120 - Sheldon (rolls dice): Me neither.\\
121 - Howard: Here’s some other fun news on the Raj/Emily front. He gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.\\
122 - Penny: You’re kidding.\\
123 - Leonard: You think she’s taking advantage of him?\\
124 - Penny: Oh, of course not. She wouldn’t do something like that. She’s deaf.\\
125 - Leonard: Deaf women can’t be gold diggers?\\
126 - Penny: Handicapped people are nice, Leonard. Everyone knows that.\\
127 - Sheldon: Yeah, I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion.\\
128 - Leonard: Could you tell us?\\
129 - Sheldon: Let’s see. (Rolls dice) Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.\\
130 - Penny: Wait, hang on. Doubles. Roll again.\\
131 - Sheldon: Okay, get this. It doesn’t matter if he’s showering her with gifts, because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy.\\
132 - Penny: What do you mean, vastly wealthy?\\
133 - Sheldon: Well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more. I’m not sure what’s tripping you up.\\
134 - Leonard: Look, I know they have money. I don’t think it’s that much.\\
135 - Sheldon: No, you’re wrong. See, as you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well, from time to time, I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren’t just rich, they’re Richie Rich rich.\\
136 - Penny: Well, so how much is that?\\
137 - Sheldon: About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.\\
138 - Howard: What the hell? The last time we went to the zoo, that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro.\\
139 - Leonard: Listen, guys, I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be rude, but I need to go call Raj’s sister, who I love so much. So vastly much.\\
140 - Penny: Okay, so he’s got money, and it’s a few gifts and a car.\\
141 - Howard: And she got him to pay off all her credit cards.\\
142 - Penny: What? He paid off her credit cards? Damn it, I could’ve dated Raj for a couple months. But I, I wouldn’t have, because I’m not that kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj.\\
143 - Howard: He’s not going to listen, he’s in love.\\
144 - Sheldon: Can’t figure out what to do? I remember those days. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to… (rolls dice) stay right here.\\
145 - Scene: The gym.\\
146 - Howard: Yeah, this is a bad idea. We should go.\\
147 - Penny: No. I’m the one that introduced him to her. I’ve got to say something.\\
148 - Howard: Wow.\\
149 - Penny: You’re engaged to my friend.\\
150 - Howard: Hey, Bernadette doesn’t mind where I get my motor running, as long as I park in the right garage.\\
151 - Penny: I can’t believe you’re engaged to my friend. Oh, here she comes.\\
152 - Howard: Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick can’t hear you.\\
153 - Penny: Hi.\\
154 - Howard (translating): Oh, hey, hi. Nice to see you.\\
155 - Penny: Um, can we talk to you about Raj?\\
156 - Howard: She says, sure, what about him?\\
157 - Penny: Okay, um, gosh, how do I start? Um, see, Raj is kind of naive. I mean, he hasn’t dated a whole lot of women. And I’m concerned that, without meaning to, you might be taking advantage of him. You know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.And I.. I… Howard, focus. Tell her what I’m saying.\\
158 - Howard: Right. Are you a gold digger or not? Oh, uh, something, something, who the something do you think you are? Mind your own something business and go something yourself. Oh, wait, I got this now.\\
159 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. She answers the door.\\
160 - Raj: I’m so mad at you!\\
161 - Penny: Okay, wait…\\
162 - Raj: How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!\\
163 - Penny: We didn’t mean for it to be an ambush. Just, it’s kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people. And hey, since when are you so chatty?\\
164 - Raj: I’m hammered.\\
165 - Penny: Raj, come here. This girl is trouble. I mean, what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you s*x?\\
166 - Raj: The best one I ever had!\\
167 - Penny: Okay, come on. You know you can do better.\\
168 - Raj: Aha. I see what’s going on here. You and I had our crazy night together, and now you can’t stand to see me with another woman.\\
169 - Penny: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\\
170 - Raj: It’s okay. I can’t get mad at your feelings.\\
171 - Penny: I don’t have feelings.\\
172 - Raj: Yeah, that’s good. Keep telling yourself that. (Storms out)\\
173 - Penny: He is cuter now that I know he’s rich.\\
174 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
175 - Raj: I have a surprise for you. Cover your eyes. Open them. It’s a real ruby. It was a little expensive, but no one can put a price on love. Although, the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it. (Skype tone from computer) Oh, Mummy, Daddy. What a nice surprise.\\
176 - Dr Koothrappali: No, it’s not a nice surprise, it’s a bad surprise.\\
177 - Mrs Koothrappali: Penny called us.\\
178 - Raj: Penny?\\
179 - Mrs Koothrappali: She told us you’re spending all our money on your new girlfriend.\\
180 - Raj: I just got her a couple of things. She gives me things, too.\\
181 - Dr Koothrappali: Yeah, yeah, I’m a gynaecologist. I know exactly what she gives you.\\
182 - Mrs Koothrappali: You need to find a nice Indian girl from a good family. If you keep seeing this woman, you’re cut off.\\
183 - Raj: What? You’re going to make me choose between the woman I love and the money I have very strong feelings for?\\
184 - Dr Koothrappali: It’s up to you.\\
185 - Raj: Well, I choose love.\\
186 - Dr Koothrappali: Hah. You’re an idiot. Love doesn’t last. Well, he’s going to find out eventually. Think about it.\\
187 - Raj: My parents are making me choose between money and you. I choose you. (She signs) No, I think we’ll have to return the car. (Again) And that necklace, yeah, that, too. But none of those things matter, because we have something better. We have love.\\
188 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
189 - Raj: Oh, Penny, I hurt so bad.\\
190 - Penny: I know, I know.\\
191 - Raj: Sometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend she’s still with me. But I can’t watch the closed captioning without crying.\\
192 - Penny: Oh, I’m so sorry. I wish I could make you feel better.\\
193 - Raj: Seriously? I’m heartbroken and you’re hitting on me?\\
194 - Penny: What? No!\\
195 - Raj: Look, Penny, you’re great, but I had a long talk with my parents, and they said if I date an Indian girl, I get a Maserati.\\
196 - Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.\\
197 - Raj: Mmm. Oh, cheesecake, you’re just as good as a woman, even though I can’t have s*x with you.\\
198 - Howard: Try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.\\
199 - Sheldon: Should I use the rest room or wait until we get home? Come on, papa needs to void his bladder. Oh, that’s not what you want to see after three buttermilks.\\
200 - Penny: Here you go, boys. I’ll pick it up when you’re ready.\\
201 - Howard: Thanks for dinner, buddy.\\
202 - Leonard: Yeah, real big of you.\\
203 - Sheldon: Hurry, hurry, hurry.\\
204 - Penny: Oh, and don’t cheap out on the tip. We all know you’re loaded now.
\subsection {Episode 05: The Russian Rocket Reaction}
1 - Scene: The comic book store.\\
2 - Leonard: It’s from Game of Thrones. What do you think?\\
3 - Sheldon: I don’t know. If we’re going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I’ve long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?\\
4 - Leonard: What did you have in mind?\\
5 - Sheldon: Well, off the top of my head, I’d have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England.\\
6 - Leonard: It would be a replica of a movie prop.\\
7 - Sheldon: Fair enough. It’d give you the right to rule a replica of England.\\
8 - Leonard: Well, they don’t have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?\\
9 - Sheldon: Mm. Tough decision. There’s no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?\\
10 - Leonard: Just Bilbo Baggins’ sword over there.\\
11 - Sheldon: Two grown men with a hobbit’s dagger; wouldn’t we look silly? Okay, let’s go for it.\\
12 - Stuart: Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure.\\
13 - Leonard: Yeah. It’s okay, I guess.\\
14 - Sheldon: Okay? It’s magnificent.\\
15 - Leonard: Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?\\
16 - Stuart: Oh, it’s hard to put a price on something that’s a copy of something that was on pay cable. But for my friends, let’s say 250?\\
17 - Leonard: Oh, that’s pretty steep.\\
18 - Stuart: Well, it’s a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys.\\
19 - Sheldon: Only 8,000? We’re wasting precious time. Buy it.\\
20 - Leonard: Hang on. Can you do any better?\\
21 - Stuart: Are you kidding? I’m already giving you the friends and family discount.\\
22 - Sheldon: Oh, did you hear that? We’re getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it.\\
23 - Leonard: Slow down. Two hundred.\\
24 - Sheldon: What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.\\
25 - Leonard: Will you shut up?\\
26 - Stuart: Tell you what, I’ll go two thirty-five.\\
27 - Leonard: Nope. Maybe another time.\\
28 - Stuart: Okay, two twenty five, my final offer.\\
29 - Sheldon: Take it, take it.\\
30 - Leonard: Two hundred.\\
31 - Stuart: Man, you’re killing me!\\
32 - Sheldon: Killing you? I can’t breathe.\\
33 - Stuart: Two ten, and I’m losing money.\\
34 - Sheldon: Oh, now, we can’t let him lose money, Leonard. I’m so sorry.\\
35 - Leonard: Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.\\
36 - Stuart: Are you crazy? That helmet’s signed by Robert Downey Jr.\\
37 - Leonard: So?\\
38 - Stuart: Okay, if you’re going to question the importance of an actor’s signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!\\
39 - Leonard: Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.\\
40 - Stuart: Thank you. I can eat meat this week.\\
41 - Leonard: See that? I just saved us forty bucks.\\
42 - Sheldon: I’ve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts.\\
43 - Stuart: You want me to wrap it?\\
44 - Leonard: No, it’s okay. I’m gonna stab my friend in the chest.\\
45 - Wil Wheaton (entering): Hey, Stuart.\\
46 - Stuart: Ah, hey, Wil.\\
47 - Sheldon: Hello, Wil Wheaton.\\
48 - Wil: Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.\\
49 - Sheldon: It’s part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?\\
50 - Wil: No.\\
51 - Sheldon: I’m not surprised.\\
52 - Stuart: Here’s the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted.\\
53 - Wil: Awesome. What do I owe you?\\
54 - Stuart: Forty bucks.\\
55 - Wil: Good deal.\\
56 - Sheldon: Sucker. Didn’t even ask for the friends and family discount.\\
57 - Wil: Hey, I’m having a party at my house on Friday, and I was hoping you would stop by.\\
58 - Stuart: Will there be girls there?\\
59 - Wil: Yeah, of course.\\
60 - Stuart: ‘Cause there wasn’t last time.\\
61 - Wil: There will be girls. You guys are invited if you want to come by.\\
62 - Leonard: Thank you.\\
63 - Wil: All right, great. Later.\\
64 - Sheldon: I see what you’re doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we’re going to be there, and when we don’t show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.\\
65 - Leonard: I was actually thinking about going.\\
66 - Sheldon: And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it.\\
67 - Leonard: No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time.\\
68 - Stuart: Oh, great, more guys. It’s gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest.\\
69 - Credits sequence.\\
70 - Scene: The apartment.\\
71 - Leonard: Sheldon, can you grab me a water?\\
72 - Sheldon: Possibly.\\
73 - Leonard: Can you or can’t you?\\
74 - Sheldon: It’s not that simple, Leonard.\\
75 - Leonard: It never is, is it?\\
76 - Sheldon: At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton’s party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I’m characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger’s Friendship.\\
77 - Leonard: Got it. Can I have my water?\\
78 - Sheldon: Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor.\\
79 - Penny: Wait, what is going on?\\
80 - Sheldon: In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger’s cat is a thought experiment…\\
81 - Penny: No, no, no, no, I didn’t forget. Um, there’s this cat in a box and until you open it, it’s either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother’s camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.\\
82 - Amy: Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. You’re the whole package, aren’t you?\\
83 - Howard (arriving): Sorry I’m late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team’s design for the deep field space telescope that’s going on the International Space Station this spring.\\
84 - All: Wow.\\
85 - Bernadette: Howie, that’s wonderful! Congratulations!\\
86 - Howard: It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is.\\
87 - Sheldon: Mohammed Lee.\\
88 - Howard: Who’s Mohammed Lee?\\
89 - Sheldon: Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn’t know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.\\
90 - Howard: It’s me, Sheldon. It’s me. I’m going up in space! Technically, I’m an astronaut.\\
91 - All: Wow, that’s amazing!\\
92 - Bernadette: Hang on a second. NASA doesn’t have a shuttle any more. How are you going to get up there?\\
93 - Howard: Oh, well, it’s really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market.\\
94 - Bernadette: Are those Russian rockets safe?\\
95 - Howard: Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl.\\
96 - Leonard: I’d like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard’s making that a reality. We’re all very proud of you.\\
97 - All: Cheers.\\
98 - Sheldon: That was a lovely toast. Kudos.\\
99 - Leonard: Thank you.\\
100 - Sheldon: Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichés. You sicken me.\\
101 - Scene: Bernadette’s car.\\
102 - Howard: You’re really quiet. Is everything okay?\\
103 - Bernadette: Fine. Just a little tired.\\
104 - Howard: I hope not too tired, because I’m feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift.\\
105 - Bernadette: I always catch your drift.\\
106 - Howard: All right, well, something’s obviously bugging you. What is it?\\
107 - Bernadette: I just can’t believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.\\
108 - Howard: Oh, I get it. You’re worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there’s a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.\\
109 - Bernadette: Just stop talking, Howard.\\
110 - Howard: This isn’t the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.\\
111 - Bernadette: What did you think was going to happen?\\
112 - Howard: Honestly? s*x.\\
113 - Bernadette: Howard.\\
114 - Howard: Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?\\
115 - Bernadette: Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We’re supposed to be partners. We’re supposed to be a team.\\
116 - Howard: I’m sorry. You’re right. Okay, let’s try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I’d like to discuss it.\\
117 - Bernadette: Okay.\\
118 - Howard: I’ve been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?\\
119 - Bernadette: Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process.\\
120 - Howard: Hey, we’re a team. So, what do you think?\\
121 - Bernadette: No.\\
122 - Howard: No?\\
123 - Bernadette: No.\\
124 - Howard: Well why not?\\
125 - Bernadette: Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. It was horrible. And I don’t want to live that way with you.\\
126 - Howard: Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11. We never saw him again.\\
127 - Bernadette: Oh, boo-hoo, you’re not going to space!\\
128 - Scene: The apartment.\\
129 - Leonard: Pretty cool about Howard, huh?\\
130 - Sheldon: Don’t talk to me as if nothing’s happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy.\\
131 - Leonard: For God’s sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.\\
132 - Sheldon: Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?\\
133 - Leonard: You never stop talking, do you?\\
134 - Amy: I don’t understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton’s party?\\
135 - Penny: Wil Wheaton is Sheldon’s mortal enemy.\\
136 - Amy: Mortal enemy?\\
137 - Penny: Mm-hmm.\\
138 - Amy: Sheldon, I know you’re a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?\\
139 - Sheldon: In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?\\
140 - Penny: Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.\\
141 - Sheldon: You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This’ll just take a moment. It’s on a five and a quarter inch floppy.\\
142 - Amy: A floppy disk?\\
143 - Sheldon: Well, I started the list when I was nine.\\
144 - Amy: How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?\\
145 - All: Oh! Oh, God!\\
146 - Sheldon: As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list.\\
147 - Scene: Howard’s bedroom.\\
148 - Bernadette: Howard?\\
149 - Howard: Change your mind about s*x? I’m still mad, but I’ll do it.\\
150 - Bernadette: No, I’ve just been thinking. It doesn’t matter if I’m afraid for your safety. I don’t want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams.\\
151 - Howard: Really?\\
152 - Bernadette: Really. If going into space means that much to you, I will never say another word about it.\\
153 - Howard: Thank you.\\
154 - Bernadette: I love you.\\
155 - Howard: I love you, too. So, s*x now?\\
156 - Bernadette: Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. I’ll be right back. (Exits)\\
157 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Over my dead body my son goes into outer space!\\
158 - Bernadette: I’m ready.\\
159 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
160 - Leonard: Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?\\
161 - Howard: What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.\\
162 - Raj: Wow. You’re not only our first astronaut. You’re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You’re like a rock star.\\
163 - Howard: Little bit.\\
164 - Leonard: I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.\\
165 - Sheldon: Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.\\
166 - Leonard: Going to Wheaton’s party is not betraying you.\\
167 - Sheldon: Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it’s doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you’re looking for.\\
168 - Leonard: I’m going to a party. I’m not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!\\
169 - Sheldon: Not yet.\\
170 - Raj: So, what’s gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?\\
171 - Howard: I don’t know. If we’re going to get back together, she’s going to have to apologize and accept that I’m a grown man who can make his own decisions.\\
172 - Raj: Then she’s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.\\
173 - Howard: Obviously.\\
174 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
175 - Bernadette: I had no choice. I had to tell his mother. He can’t go to space. He’s like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?\\
176 - Amy: You’re kidding.\\
177 - Penny: No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book.\\
178 - Bernadette: I don’t know what I’m going to do. I don’t want to break up over this.\\
179 - Penny: Okay, why don’t you just tell him you made a mistake?\\
180 - Bernadette: Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad guy in this?\\
181 - Amy: It’s not for us to judge. We’re just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you’ve done.\\
182 - Bernadette: Oh, God, you’re right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.\\
183 - Penny: Well, that, that’s good. I’m glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.\\
184 - Bernadette: What?\\
185 - Penny: Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?\\
186 - Bernadette: I do, with all my heart.\\
187 - Penny: Got it. Just had to check.\\
188 - Amy: He’s great.\\
189 - Scene: The apartment.\\
190 - Leonard: All right, Sheldon, we’re going to Wil’s. This is your last chance.\\
191 - Sheldon: No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you’re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers.\\
192 - Leonard: You want to drive?\\
193 - Raj: Sure.\\
194 - Leonard: Hey, Sheldon?\\
195 - Sheldon: Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.\\
196 - Leonard: No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party.\\
197 - Sheldon: Brent Spiner?\\
198 - Leonard: Yes.\\
199 - Sheldon: I don’t care.\\
200 - Leonard: Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.\\
201 - Sheldon: I did, but I think I’ve kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey.\\
202 - Leonard: I’m going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.\\
203 - Sheldon: Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.\\
204 - Scene: Howard’s bedroom.\\
205 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, Bernadette’s here!\\
206 - Howard: Tell her I’m not home!\\
207 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): What kind of a schmuck play is that? She can hear you shouting!\\
208 - Bernadette: Can we talk?\\
209 - Howard: You can. I have nothing to say.\\
210 - Bernadette: All right. I just wanted to tell you I’m sorry I said something to your mother.\\
211 - Howard: I was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back.\\
212 - Bernadette: I know. I’m sorry. I got scared.\\
213 - Howard: If you’re gonna love me, you’re gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil.\\
214 - Bernadette: I know.\\
215 - Howard: Well, don’t say it if you’re not gonna mean it, ’cause I’m not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean.\\
216 - Bernadette: Really? You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean.\\
217 - Howard: Well, those big kids were rocking it.\\
218 - Bernadette: I just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle.\\
219 - Howard: Really?\\
220 - Bernadette: You’re my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.\\
221 - Howard: Right, right.\\
222 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Make up all you want! Your tuchus is not leaving this planet!\\
223 - Scene: Wil Wheaton’s party.\\
224 - Raj: Hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg Queen in First Contact?\\
225 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
226 - Raj: Well, I just met her gynaecologist!\\
227 - Leonard: What are you doing here?\\
228 - Sheldon: Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, you’re still my little buddy. I’m not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let’s meet Brent Spiner and go home.\\
229 - Wil: Hey, Sheldon, I’m so glad you made it. I found something I think you might like.\\
230 - Sheldon: What I’d like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.\\
231 - Wil: This is for you.\\
232 - Sheldon: An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.\\
233 - Wil: I remembered your story about the time you went to a convention when you were a kid to get one signed, and I didn’t show up.\\
234 - Wil: Look at what I wrote.\\
235 - Sheldon: To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton.\\
236 - Wil: It’s my last one. I want you to have it.\\
237 - Sheldon: Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!\\
238 - Brent Spiner: Oh, wow. I haven’t seen one of these in years. (Rips open action figure packaging) Remember how we used to make these things look like they were m*st*rb*t*ng?\\
239 - Sheldon: Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton.\\
240 - Brent: Sorry, Slim. I’ve got some Mr. Data dolls in the trunk of my car. You want me to sign one for you?\\
241 - Sheldon: You’ve already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy.\\
242 - Wil: Don’t worry. It doesn’t take up a whole lot of your time.\\
243 - Sheldon: Come on, buddy. Let’s not waste another second on this loser. Love your house.\\
244 - Leonard: Can we get autographed dolls?\\
245 - Brent: Sure. Twenty bucks.\\
246 - Leonard: Ten.\\
247 - Brent: Eighteen.\\
248 - Leonard: Twelve.\\
249 - Brent: Sixteen.\\
250 - Leonard: Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.\\
251 - Brent: Done.
\subsection {Episode 06: The Rhinitis Revelation}
1 - Scene: The apartment. Sheldon’s mother is visiting.\\
2 - Leonard: So what kind of cruise is this you’re going on?\\
3 - Mrs Cooper: It’s called the Born Again Boat Ride. Christian Quarterly gave it their highest rating, five thorny crowns. I do wish you’d come with me, Sheldon.\\
4 - Sheldon: Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof that your God can work miracles.\\
5 - Mrs Cooper: You’re missing out. It’s gonna be wall-to-wall fun. It’s all themed. There’s Jonah and the Whale Watching, all-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet, and my personal favourite, Gunning with God.\\
6 - Leonard: What’s Gunning with God? I’m afraid to ask.\\
7 - Mrs Cooper: Oh, it is a hoot and a half. You write your sins on a clay pigeon, they fire ‘em up in the air, and you pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun full of our Lord’s forgiveness.\\
8 - Sheldon: Frankly, Mom, I’m encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge.\\
9 - Mrs Cooper: For example, if Shelly was aboard, he’d write “smart mouth” on his pigeon, and then bam!\\
10 - Sheldon: The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away. Well, Mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together, the fun begins with fried chicken.\\
11 - Mrs Cooper: Sounds delicious.\\
12 - Sheldon: Good, ’cause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My mother’s fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin.\\
13 - Leonard: Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesn’t want to cook.\\
14 - Sheldon: Of course she does. Making me food is her way of saying I love you. Making me food when she’s too tired to cook is her way of saying I really love you.\\
15 - Mrs Cooper: Actually, I wouldn’t mind going out for a bite, Sheldon.\\
16 - Sheldon: Won’t that spoil our appetites for the chicken you’re going to make me?\\
17 - Leonard: All right, that settles it, we’re going out. Do you like sushi? There’s a great little place down the street.\\
18 - Mrs Cooper: I’ve never had it, but there’s no harm in trying something new.\\
19 - Sheldon: There’s a lot of harm in trying something new. That’s why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.\\
20 - Leonard: Sheldon, you’re talking like a crazy person.\\
21 - Mrs Cooper: Actually, I had him tested as a child. Doctor says he’s fine.\\
22 - Sheldon: Told you.\\
23 - Mrs Cooper: Although, I do regret not following up with that specialist in Houston.\\
24 - Credits Sequence.\\
25 - Scene: A sushi bar.\\
26 - All: Irasshaimase!\\
27 - Sheldon: Stop yelling! I’m not happy about this.\\
28 - Leonard: What’s the last thing you were ever happy about?\\
29 - Sheldon: The prospect of fried chicken.\\
30 - Mrs Cooper: This is exciting. Back home, the diner on Route Four serves sushi, but it’s just cut up fish sticks and a side of Uncle Ben’s. They put it on the menu in those kung fu letters, but that don’t make it sushi.\\
31 - Leonard: Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct.\\
32 - Mrs Cooper: Oh, I thought the one we couldn’t say was ching chong.\\
33 - Leonard: Yeah, yeah, that, too.\\
34 - Mrs Cooper: So, Shelly, what’s up with you and your friend Amy, if you don’t mind a mother prying a bit?\\
35 - Sheldon: Well, there’s actually big news on the Amy front. She’s been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine.\\
36 - Mrs Cooper: Do you have any idea what’s going on with those two?\\
37 - Leonard: It’s kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe there’s something there, maybe there isn’t. We’ll probably never know. But sometimes it’s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.\\
38 - Mrs Cooper: How are you doing on the young lady front? I hear you’re in some sort of a long distance situation?\\
39 - Leonard: Uh, yeah, it’s Raj’s sister. It’s kind of tough. She’s in India. Also, her parents aren’t happy she’s dating someone white.\\
40 - Mrs Cooper: Oh, that’s a funny turn, isn’t it? You never think about it going the other way. Well, you can’t force things. You need to figure out if you’re in a relationship or if you’re just calling it one. It’s like they say, a cat can have kittens in the oven but that don’t make ‘em biscuits.\\
41 - Sheldon: And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a chicken to Crisco, but you can’tmake your mother fry it.\\
42 - Mrs Cooper: Sheldon, you pester me one more time about chicken, I will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant.\\
43 - Leonard: Please pester her. Please, for me.\\
44 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
45 - Leonard: So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?\\
46 - Mrs Cooper: It was good. The only thing that would have made it better is if it was cooked and if it was beef. Sheldon, when is your landlord going to fix the elevator?\\
47 - Sheldon: I don’t know. Lately we’ve been talking about converting it into a missile silo.\\
48 - Leonard: Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank.\\
49 - Sheldon: Get them before they get us.\\
50 - Raj (Sitting against their front door, drinking a beer): Hey, look who decided to show up.\\
51 - Leonard: Raj, what are you doing?\\
52 - Raj: I couldn’t find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three, sadly, are dead.\\
53 - Sheldon: Mom, you remember Rajesh? Rajesh, my mother.\\
54 - Raj: Of course. Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again.\\
55 - Mrs Cooper: Well, it’s so nice to see you, too. I thought it was our Indians that had the occasional alcohol problem.\\
56 - Leonard: We don’t say that, either. I’ll make you a list.\\
57 - Mrs Cooper: Oh, that would be mighty white of you. So, Raj, what pain are you trying to cover up with alcohol?\\
58 - Raj: Nothing, I’m fine.\\
59 - Mrs Cooper: Are ya?\\
60 - Raj: No. (Bursts into tears)\\
61 - Mrs Cooper: That’s better. Now tell me what’s bothering you.\\
62 - Raj: I’m so lonely.\\
63 - Sheldon: Oh, yes, born alone, die alone. It’s a tragic human condition. Now, Raj, if you’ll excuse my mother, she’s about to make a pecan pie that’ll be so good I’ll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken.\\
64 - Mrs Cooper: Sheldon, your friend is hurtin’. What do we do when someone’s hurtin’?\\
65 - Sheldon: Offer them a hot beverage.\\
66 - Mrs Cooper: And when they’re drunk as a skunk, what beverage do we offer?\\
67 - Sheldon: Coffee.\\
68 - Mrs Cooper: And what do we do it with? (Sheldon fixes a large false smile.) Now you listen to me. I know you feel like you can’t find someone, but there’s a lock for every key. Back home, there’s a girl works at the Wal-Mart. Tall, tall girl. Woman could hunt geese with a rake. Thought she’d never find a man, then one day, wouldn’t ya know, Harlem Globetrotters come to town. Long story short, today that woman travels the world with a semi-professional basketball player and two beautiful mixed-race babies.\\
69 - Raj: I didn’t get a lot of that because of your accent, but the general tone was soothing and somehow I feel better.\\
70 - Sheldon: I’m not going to get my pecan pie, am I?\\
71 - Leonard: You want some Oreos?\\
72 - Sheldon: Double Stuf?\\
73 - Leonard: No, regular.\\
74 - Sheldon: Nice. Kick a man when he’s down.\\
75 - Scene: The laundry room.\\
76 - Sheldon: I’m glad we’re finally getting to do something together, just the two of us.\\
77 - Mrs Cooper: Sure. One thing you really miss when you’re on vacation is laundry.\\
78 - Sheldon: Careful, you’re using too much Downey. You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy.\\
79 - Mrs Cooper: Well, this takes me back. Me doing your laundry, you next to me criticizing.\\
80 - Sheldon: It is nice, isn’t it?\\
81 - Penny (arriving): Mrs. Cooper. Hi!\\
82 - Mrs Cooper: Oh, hello, darlin’.\\
83 - Penny: Sheldon, you didn’t tell me your mom was coming.\\
84 - Sheldon: It was in my weekly e-mail blast. Right between beet season is finally here, and uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare.\\
85 - Mrs Cooper: So, how’ve you been?\\
86 - Penny: Good, good.\\
87 - Mrs Cooper: I hear that Leonard has a new girlfriend. How are you doing with all that?\\
88 - Penny: Oh, fine. You know, it’s been a while. I’m getting back out there.\\
89 - Mrs Cooper: Let me ask you, when you get back out there, are you wearing this? (Holds up a skimpy top)\\
90 - Penny: Well, it’s super cute on. That top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost.\\
91 - Sheldon: Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures.\\
92 - Mrs Cooper: Hon, you think maybe the reason why you’re having trouble finding a guy to settle down with is because you’re letting them ride the roller coaster without buying a ticket?\\
93 - Penny: Oh, they don’t always get to ride the roller coaster. Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. Now I’m going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I’m going to wear?\\
94 - Mrs Cooper: Oh, not crazy at all. And don’t beat yourself up. When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride and a bottle of strawberry wine.\\
95 - Sheldon: Now that will not be in this week’s e-mail blast.\\
96 - Scene: The apartment.\\
97 - Howard: So, this spring, I get to go to the International Space Station.\\
98 - Mrs Cooper: Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens. If you ever want to live there eternally, I’ve got a good book you could read.\\
99 - Howard: Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special every year, so I get the gist.\\
100 - Mrs Cooper: I bet your mom is really proud of you.\\
101 - Howard: Nope. She says if I don’t back out she’s going to go on a hunger strike. It would take years before she’d be in any kind of danger, but still.\\
102 - Sheldon: I’ve got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I’m taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I’ve worked up a couple of Q’s that will stump his sorry A.\\
103 - Mrs Cooper: I don’t know, Shelly. I thought we could do a little sightseeing.\\
104 - Sheldon: What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate?\\
105 - Mrs Cooper: Come on, Sheldon, we’ll take your mom to see the Hollywood sign, the wax museum, the Walk of Fame.\\
106 - Penny: Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive.\\
107 - Mrs Cooper: Well, I can’t spend twelve hundred dollars on a handbag, but it’s free to look upon those who do with righteous condemnation.\\
108 - Howard: What do you say?\\
109 - Sheldon: What do I say? I say you people need to stop ruining my mom’s visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. Stop it.\\
110 - Howard (after Raj whispers to him): He’s not talking about your shirt. Your shirt is fine.\\
111 - Scene: The kitchen.\\
112 - Leonard: These are delicious.\\
113 - Mrs Cooper: The trick to pancakes is bacon grease. I cook everything in it.\\
114 - Leonard: Everything? Aren’t you worried about your health?\\
115 - Mrs Cooper: Oh, doctors are always changing their mind. One week bacon grease is bad for you. The next week we’re not getting enough of it. Good morning, Shelly.\\
116 - Sheldon: Mom, I want to apologize for my behaviour last night.\\
117 - Mrs Cooper: Apology accepted.\\
118 - Sheldon: Great. Now, you’re going to love the Perlmutter lecture. Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts.\\
119 - Mrs Cooper: I am still going out with your friends.\\
120 - Sheldon: But I apologized. And that was hard for me because I didn’t do anything wrong.\\
121 - Mrs Cooper: Shelly, I hung out with you in enough dusty lecture halls while you were growing up. I want to go sightseeing. So why don’t you have some pancakes, get dressed and come with us.\\
122 - Sheldon: I’m not going, and you can’t make me.\\
123 - Mrs Cooper: You’re right, I can’t. Have a nice day.\\
124 - Sheldon: Well, I’m going to stand here until you change your mind.\\
125 - Mrs Cooper: Well, then you are going to stand there all day.\\
126 - Leonard: I’m just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.\\
127 - Sheldon: I can’t believe my own mother is abandoning me.\\
128 - Mrs Cooper: I am not abandoning you. Sheldon, abandoning you is leaving you in a basket on a church doorstep. I am going to Hollywood and thank a wax Ronald Reagan for his service to our country.\\
129 - Sheldon: We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother.\\
130 - Mrs Cooper: Well, I guess we are.\\
131 - Leonard: Sorry. Syrup.\\
132 - Sheldon: All right, Mom. When you’re at the Ripley’s Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world’s most wonderful son, believe it, because it’s true. (Grabs pancakes and snatches syrup from Leonard’s hand)\\
133 - Leonard: I hadn’t…\\
134 - Scene: Amy’s apartment.\\
135 - Sheldon: That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper. (Sneezes)\\
136 - Amy: Are you getting sick?\\
137 - Sheldon: No, I’m just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason.\\
138 - Amy: Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isn’t making you a priority?\\
139 - Sheldon: No. Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh.\\
140 - Amy: Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.\\
141 - Sheldon: Oh, there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.\\
142 - Amy: Sheldon, we’re all animals. And granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, you’re just like everybody else.\\
143 - Sheldon: Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?\\
144 - Amy: Actually, some research indicates that by not over-thinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better. (He sneezes again) Sure you’re not coming down with a cold?\\
145 - Sheldon: Oh, yes, the common cold. Just like everyone else. You’d love that, wouldn’t you?\\
146 - Scene: A church.\\
147 - Mrs Cooper: Oh, this one’s sweet. You know, for your rosary rattlers.\\
148 - Leonard: Mrs. Cooper, we say Catholics, not rosary rattlers.\\
149 - Mrs Cooper: My goodness, it’s a wonder you people in California can talk at all.\\
150 - Penny: This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.\\
151 - Leonard: What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches.\\
152 - Penny: Hey, they have wine here, don’t they?\\
153 - Raj (pointing at a crucifixion statue): Hey, none of our gods have abs like that.\\
154 - Howard: Yep, that’s the last Jew who did sit-ups. And look where it got him.\\
155 - Mrs Cooper: Hey, while we’re here, why don’t we all do some praying? Let’s put a little church in this church.\\
156 - Leonard: Oh, I’m not sure we should.\\
157 - Mrs Cooper: It’s easy. I’ll show you how. Lord, Mary Cooper here. Coming to you from Gomorrah, California. I want to thank you for the blessing that is my little Shelly. I also want to thank you for the continued strength not to coldcock him with my Bible. All right, Penny, your turn.\\
158 - Penny: Okay, um, hey, God. What’s up? Um, I’m good, but, uh, it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth. But no cops. Be cool.\\
159 - Mrs Cooper: She also goes a little overboard on the love thy neighbour. Could probably use that chat you had with Mary Magdalene. Leonard, you’re up. Wasserman, you’re on deck.\\
160 - Leonard: Okay. I don’t know, it’s probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. She’s all the way in India. That would be great.\\
161 - Mrs Cooper: Hear that? Girl trouble. Turns out we were both wrong on that front. How about you?\\
162 - Howard: Oh, me? No. Thanks, I’m good. I’m really just trying not to burst into flames.\\
163 - Mrs Cooper: Rajesh?\\
164 - Howard: He says he’s having trouble dropping those last five pounds.\\
165 - Mrs Cooper: Huh, I might have gone with the talking-to-girls thing.\\
166 - Howard: No, you only get one wish.\\
167 - Scene: A park bench. Sheldon is sitting. A stranger sits next to him.\\
168 - Sheldon: Look at the two of us. Me, a highly regarded physicist. The kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. You, the common man, tired from your labours as a stockbroker, or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack. But deep down inside, apparently we’re just two peas in a pod. A regular pea, and the kind of pea that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. Rain. Another great equalizer. Falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike. (The stranger puts up an umbrella) Smarty-pants.\\
169 - Scene: The kitchen.\\
170 - Penny: Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good.\\
171 - Mrs Cooper: You take notes, darlin’. The real way to get a man is with melted cheese and cream of mushroom soup. He’ll die at 50 but his love will be true.\\
172 - Sheldon (entering, soaked): I need a tissue.This one got wet.\\
173 - Leonard: Here.\\
174 - Sheldon: Thank you. Yeah, I’ve learned something today. You and I, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what counts, we’re the same. (Sneezes)\\
175 - Mrs Cooper: Sweetheart, are you sick?\\
176 - Sheldon: I hope so, because if this is well, life isn’t worth living.\\
177 - Mrs Cooper: Oh, sugarpie, you are burning up. We’ve got to get you to bed.\\
178 - Sheldon: Okay.\\
179 - Mrs Cooper: Don’t worry. Mama’s here to take care of her baby.\\
180 - Sheldon: And just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people.\\
181 - Mrs Cooper: Of course.\\
182 - Sheldon: Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?\\
183 - Mrs Cooper: You can have whatever you want.\\
184 - Sheldon: Thanks, Mom.You’re the best.\\
185 - Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.\\
186 - Mrs Cooper: Boy, last time I put VapoRub on you, you didn’t have hair on your chest.\\
187 - Sheldon: I know, it filled in last year. I didn’t get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit.\\
188 - Mrs Cooper: And whose fault was that?\\
189 - Sheldon: Yours.\\
190 - Mrs Cooper: Shelly, you’re not eight years old any more. We have to have a different relationship.\\
191 - Sheldon: No, we don’t. The one we have works great.\\
192 - Mrs Cooper: Sweetheart, you are a grown man.\\
193 - Sheldon: Or maybe I’m part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means I’m still basically a toddler.\\
194 - Mrs Cooper: Oh, I so should have taken you to Houston.\\
195 - Sheldon: Does this mean you’re not going to sing Soft Kitty?\\
196 - Mrs Cooper: No, I will always sing you Soft Kitty. (Sings) Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…\\
197 - Leonard (at door): Mrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven?\\
198 - Sheldon: Get out!\\
199 - Mrs Cooper: Well, that was rude.\\
200 - Sheldon: Well, I know, but he means well. Sing.\\
201 - Mrs Cooper: Happy kitty, sleepy kitty…\\
202 - Sheldon: What are you trying to pull, Mom? From the top.\\
203 - Mrs Cooper (to God): This is what I’m talking about. (Sings) Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…
\subsection {Episode 07: The Good Guy Fluctuation}
1 - Scene: Sheldon’s office.\\
2 - Sheldon: And reverse the spin on the antiproton, and gamma becomes alpha, multiplied by a matrix of negative I comma zero, and there we have it. Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after nine o’clock.\\
3 - Ghostly voice: Sheldon, Sheldon.\\
4 - Sheldon: Hmm. (Looks outside office door. Corridor lamp sparks and goes out. Corridor is bathed in an eerie glow) All right, all right. I see what’s going on. A little pre-Halloween hijinkery. A ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch’s cackle. The trifecta of haunted house clichés. Instead of eek, I say yawn.\\
5 - Ghostly voice: Sheldon.\\
6 - Sheldon: Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution. (Reading message on wall) See you in hell Sheldon. The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma. (A luminous skeleton rushes towards him) Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow.\\
7 - Raj: You should’ve seen your face.\\
8 - Sheldon: Yes, there’s nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled.\\
9 - Howard: Come on, admit it. We got you, Sheldon.\\
10 - Sheldon: Please, fright depends on an element of surprise. The simple fact is, because I am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me. (Leonard creeps out behind him wearing a Star Trek Balok mask)\\
11 - Raj: He’s probably right.\\
12 - Howard: We can’t beat him. He’s just too smart.\\
13 - Sheldon: Gentlemen. (Turns and sees Leonard. Screams and faints).\\
14 - Howard: Who had money on faints?\\
15 - Raj: I had pee his pants.\\
16 - Leonard: Hang on. Looks like everyone’s a winner.\\
17 - Credits sequence.\\
18 - Scene: The comic book store.\\
19 - Leonard: Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!\\
20 - Sheldon: Droll.\\
21 - Howard:Not as droll as a grown man passed out in a puddle of his own urine.\\
22 - Leonard: That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.\\
23 - Sheldon: Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. You think you’ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well, you’ve forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I’m Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, ask Mexico.\\
24 - Stuart: Hot girl, nine o’clock. Don’t everybody look at once!\\
25 - Raj: What is she doing in a comic book store?\\
26 - Stuart: I don’t know, she might be lost. Doesn’t matter. Watch and learn. Hi.\\
27 - Hot girl: Hi.\\
28 - Stuart: Um… it-it-it… (returns to guys) Shut up.\\
29 - Hot girl (to Leonard): Are you getting this Next Men?\\
30 - Leonard: Uh, yeah. It’s issue number 21. First appearance of Hellboy.\\
31 - Hot girl: I know. I’ve been looking for it for years.\\
32 - Leonard: Sorry.\\
33 - Hot girl: Hey, if I pretended to hit on you, could I distract you enough to sneak it away?\\
34 - Leonard: Yes, but you’d be using your superpowers for evil.\\
35 - Hot girl: Damn, I’m forbidden by my Kryptonian father to do so. I am Alice.\\
36 - Leonard: Leonard.\\
37 - Alice: You are very cute, Leonard.\\
38 - Leonard: Thanks. You, too. You know, go ahead and take it.\\
39 - Alice: No, no. No, no, I, I, I did evil. Would you be open to a trade?\\
40 - Leonard: Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess.\\
41 - Alice: Okay. Here. This is my number, call me.\\
42 - Leonard: Sorry, palm’s a little sweaty. What’s that word?\\
43 - Alice: Alice.\\
44 - Leonard: Oh, right, your name. That makes more sense than pen1s.\\
45 - Alice: Later.\\
46 - Howard: Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?\\
47 - Stuart: ‘Cause if you did, you get your picture up there on the Wall of Heroes.\\
48 - Leonard: No, I don’t think I picked her up. Besides, I have a girlfriend.\\
49 - Stuart: Doesn’t matter. This is the closest anyone’s ever come. You’re going on the wall, my friend.\\
50 - Scene: Entering the apartment building.\\
51 - Sheldon: Be sure to check the mail.\\
52 - Leonard: How many times are you gonna tell me? What’s with you?\\
53 - Sheldon: Nothing. It’s not suspicious that I’m fixating. It’s consistent with my personality.\\
54 - Leonard: Right.\\
55 - Penny: Hey, guys.\\
56 - Leonard: More Halloween candy? Didn’t you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?\\
57 - Penny: Oh. Yeah. That’s gone. It’s a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time.\\
58 - Sheldon: Leonard doesn’t have time to chat, he has to get the mail.\\
59 - Leonard: Will you relax? I’ll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?\\
60 - Sheldon: Open the mail!\\
61 - Leonard: Excuse me. (Sheldon holds fingers in ears) A couple of circulars, nothing important.\\
62 - Penny: What’s with him?\\
63 - Leonard: Hang on. (Sheldon opens mail box. A loud horn blows and a balloon with Leonard’s face on pops out. Sheldon faints again.) You might be from Texas, but I’m from New Jersey.\\
64 - Scene: The apartment. Leonard is with Alice.\\
65 - Leonard: Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con.\\
66 - Alice: What are you wearing?\\
67 - Leonard: Well, you know, it’s Comic Con. I’m Lion-O from ThunderCats.\\
68 - Alice: Wow, you must have gotten so laid.\\
69 - Leonard: No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.\\
70 - Alice: Want to see a comic I draw?\\
71 - Leonard: You’re kidding. You have your own book?\\
72 - Alice: Yeah. It’s kinda based on my life.\\
73 - Leonard: Cool. Oh, look. That’s you having s*x with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?\\
74 - Alice: You’d think, but no.\\
75 - Leonard: You’re very talented. This is really good. Did you do… (she kisses him.)\\
76 - Alice: So, can I trade you my comic for the Hellboy?\\
77 - Leonard: You can have my car.\\
78 - Scene: Sheldon’s office.\\
79 - Sheldon (creeps into office carrying a box): Oh, dear. (Reaches into box, picks up a snake) Oh, dear. (Puts snake into Raj’s top drawer) Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Purell, Purell, Purell, Purell.\\
80 - Raj (entering): Good morning, Sheldon.\\
81 - Sheldon: It is, isn’t it? Oh, bother. Isn’t that just always the way? You go to staple something, and you’re out of staples. Gosh, I wish I’d known that earlier today when I was at Staples.\\
82 - Raj: You have a thing of paper clips right there.\\
83 - Sheldon: well, no, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say, don’t you keep staples in your top desk drawer?\\
84 - Raj: I don’t know. Maybe.\\
85 - Sheldon: Be a lamb and check.\\
86 - Raj: All right. (Opening drawer) Who do we have here?\\
87 - Sheldon: It’s a snake. A terrifying snake.\\
88 - Raj: Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?\\
89 - Sheldon: Stop talking like that. You’ve been rendered speechless by fear.\\
90 - Raj: Let’s go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.\\
91 - Sheldon: I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You’re better than this.\\
92 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. There is a knock.\\
93 - Penny: It’s open.\\
94 - Leonard: Hey, you got a minute?\\
95 - Penny: Yeah, sure, come on in.\\
96 - Leonard: Thanks.\\
97 - Penny: Want some mac and cheese?\\
98 - Leonard: No. Lactose. Gas.\\
99 - Penny: Glass of wine?\\
100 - Leonard: No. Sulfites. Migraines.\\
101 - Penny: Okay, well, I’d offer you Halloween candy, but that’s gone. So, what’s up?\\
102 - Leonard: Okay, we used to go out, right?\\
103 - Penny: Oh, my God, that’s where I know you from.\\
104 - Leonard: I’m dealing with a situation and it’s kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid.\\
105 - Penny: All right, what’s going on?\\
106 - Leonard: So, you’re okay talking about this?\\
107 - Penny: Yes.\\
108 - Leonard: You’re sure it’s not weird.\\
109 - Penny: It’s okay.\\
110 - Leonard: You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that.\\
111 - Penny: Okay, good, because there’s this one guy I used to date who’s about to be force-fed wine and cheese if he doesn’t get to the point.\\
112 - Leonard: Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend…\\
113 - Penny: Yeah, probably.\\
114 - Leonard: Come on.\\
115 - Penny: I’m sorry, go ahead.\\
116 - Leonard: I met this girl, and she’s great. We have a lot in common.\\
117 - Penny: Did you guys do it?\\
118 - Leonard: No. We just made out a little.\\
119 - Penny: Oh, look at you, you bad boy. Did you tell her about Priya?\\
120 - Leonard: Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth.\\
121 - Penny: That’s gross.\\
122 - Leonard: Here’s the thing, I, I’m not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman.\\
123 - Penny: Well, good for you.\\
124 - Leonard: The problem is, I want to be one of those guys.\\
125 - Penny: So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.\\
126 - Leonard: Oh, that’s not who I am.\\
127 - Penny: All right, then break it off with the new girl.\\
128 - Leonard: Now, let’s not do anything rash. She’s really hot.\\
129 - Penny: If you like this girl so much, why don’t you just end things with Priya?\\
130 - Leonard: Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday.\\
131 - Penny: Leonard, you’re looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it.\\
132 - Leonard: Now we’re getting somewhere.\\
133 - Penny: What does your gut tell you?\\
134 - Leonard: Go ask Penny; she’ll know what to do.\\
135 - Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is adjusting a device on his arm.\\
136 - Sheldon: Hello, Howard. I’ve realized that you scaring me was all in jest. Allow me to say, job well done. (Grabs his own hand. Electrocutes himself.) Perfect.\\
137 - Leonard: What are you doing?\\
138 - Sheldon: Science. You wouldn’t understand.\\
139 - Leonard: Hey, well, see you. I’m going out. (Starts to go out. Doesn’t.)\\
140 - Sheldon: I thought you were leaving the apartment.\\
141 - Leonard: Yeah, me, too. I can’t make up my mind.\\
142 - Sheldon: Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?\\
143 - Leonard: No. I’m having a moral crisis.\\
144 - Sheldon: Well, if it’s of any help, I’ve read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss.\\
145 - Leonard: Oh, what the hell. I’m supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I don’t know if I should, because I’m going out with Priya, but she’s in India.\\
146 - Sheldon: All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won’t be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on.\\
147 - Leonard: Well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn’t do more than the stuff that you did, and I’m pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do.\\
148 - Sheldon: You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men.\\
149 - Leonard: That actually does help.\\
150 - Sheldon: It’s worth noting that he died of syphilis.\\
151 - Leonard: Screw it, I’m going.\\
152 - Sheldon: On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?\\
153 - Leonard: Do you mind? I’m questioning a lot of things in my life right now.\\
154 - Sheldon: Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?\\
155 - Leonard: No.\\
156 - Sheldon: Great. Tropicana, no pulp.\\
157 - Scene: Howard’s house. Sheldon rings the doorbell.\\
158 - Howard: Hey, Sheldon.\\
159 - Bernadette (off): Who is it?\\
160 - Sheldon: It’s me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.\\
161 - Howard: That’s not my mom, it’s Bernadette.\\
162 - Sheldon: Really? That’s very unsettling.\\
163 - Bernadette: Hi, Sheldon.\\
164 - Sheldon: Hi.\\
165 - Howard: What’s up?\\
166 - Sheldon: It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put ‘er there, you old so-and-so.\\
167 - Howard: Well, I, I’m gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don’t you think it could have waited until then?\\
168 - Sheldon: Holy smoke, why didn’t I think of that? You’re a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz. You put ‘er there, you son of a gun!\\
169 - Howard: Whatever. (Takes his hand. Starts to be electrocuted) My… oh… it’s… (Clutches heart and collapses)\\
170 - Bernadette: Oh, my God, Howard! What did you do?\\
171 - Sheldon: It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.\\
172 - Bernadette: Howard has a heart condition! You know that!\\
173 - Sheldon: Well, I thought he made that up. Isn’t hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?\\
174 - Bernadette: This is adrenaline, we’re gonna have to inject it into his heart.\\
175 - Sheldon: We are?\\
176 - Bernadette: You are. I’m not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and we’ve only got one shot.\\
177 - Sheldon: Oh, no! I can’t!\\
178 - Bernadette: Hurry! We’re running out of time!\\
179 - Sheldon: Okay.\\
180 - Bernadette: Just do it!\\
181 - Sheldon: Oh, God! One, two, three!\\
182 - Howard: Trick or treat, bubbeleh.\\
183 - Sheldon: What? No. You mean this was all a ruse? Oh, how could I be so stu… (puts hand to forehead. Electrocutes himself).\\
184 - Scene: Alice’s apartment. Alice and Leonard are kissing.\\
185 - Leonard: Damn it, I can’t. I can’t, I can’t do this.\\
186 - Alice: Uh, is it my tongue stud? ‘Cause if that freaks you out, you’re in for a real surprise later on.\\
187 - Leonard: No, no, no. I, I can’t do this. Believe me, I really want to.\\
188 - Alice: But?\\
189 - Leonard: But I kind of have a girlfriend.\\
190 - Alice: Are you kidding?\\
191 - Leonard: You’re cool with you and me just being friends, right?\\
192 - Alice: I don’t believe this.\\
193 - Leonard: Wait, I don’t, which part?\\
194 - Alice: I’m so stupid. I thought for once I’d met a good guy, but you’re just another jackass.\\
195 - Leonard: Oh, no, no, you have it wrong. No. I, I was going to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy, so, I’m gonna pass on the s*x. But you should know, that’s not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. That’s kind of my superpower. I’m, like, Captain Good Guy.\\
196 - Scene: Leonard being ejected into the corridor.\\
197 - Leonard: It’s okay. Did the right thing. You idiot!\\
198 - Scene: The apartment. Leonard is on skype.\\
199 - Leonard: Hey, Priya.\\
200 - Priya: Hey, sweetheart. How’s it going?\\
201 - Leonard: Uh, not so good. We have to talk.\\
202 - Priya: Oh, sounds serious. What’s up?\\
203 - Leonard: Okay, uh, here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her, and I feel terrible about it. But it’s done, it’s never gonna happen again. And I am so, so sorry.\\
204 - Priya: Leonard, relax. It’s okay.\\
205 - Leonard: It is?\\
206 - Priya: Yeah, these things happen. They happen to everybody.\\
207 - Leonard: Oh, my God, you are amazing. I mean, I don’t deserve you. Wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?\\
208 - Priya: Leonard, I didn’t know if I should tell you, but I kind of cheated on you, too.\\
209 - Leonard: Uh, kind of?\\
210 - Priya: A couple of weeks ago, I slept with my ex-boyfriend. So, I guess we both messed up a little.\\
211 - Leonard: No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot.\\
212 - Priya: Well, it’s not a competition.\\
213 - Leonard: Oh yeah, it is, and you won. I, I, I’m, I’m sorry, I have to go. I don’t believe this.\\
214 - Sheldon (leaping out of the base of the sofa): Bazinga, punk. Now we’re even.
\subsection {Episode 08: The Isolation Permutation}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Penny: So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?\\
3 - Bernadette: Well, if you don’t mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great.\\
4 - Amy: Girlfriends, I have the answer to our dress problems.\\
5 - Bernadette: Really?\\
6 - Amy: Twelve years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before her wedding.\\
7 - Bernadette: That’s horrible.\\
8 - Amy: Yes and no. All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused and available to us for free. So it seems that cloud of odourless deadly gas had a silver lining after all. Check it out, still in the bags. The gowns, not the bridesmaids.\\
9 - Bernadette: I don’t know. Dead people’s dresses?\\
10 - Penny: Yeah, and cap sleeves? U-u-uh.\\
11 - Amy: Uh, I was hoping you wouldn’t notice. Irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes, and sadly as it turned out, space heaters.\\
12 - Sheldon: Ladies, please. These four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach. But through no one’s fault, Penny, the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined. And again, I’m looking at no one in particular, Penny.\\
13 - Leonard: Fine. What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?\\
14 - Howard: What would you like to talk about, Sheldon? Why do you hate us?\\
15 - Sheldon: I’ve prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists.\\
16 - Penny: Okay, that time you looked at me.\\
17 - Amy: Who didn’t? Your skin is like alabaster. Do you even have pores?\\
18 - Sheldon: Topic one. Faster-than-light particles at CERN, paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese? And converse.\\
19 - Penny: All right, who wants to go to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?\\
20 - Bernadette: Oh, me.\\
21 - Penny: Through no one’s fault, Sheldon, we’re leaving.\\
22 - Amy: Wait for moi.\\
23 - Sheldon: You’re leaving?\\
24 - Amy: Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I’m a lady. And with that comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body.\\
25 - Sheldon: Ah. New topic. Women, delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?\\
26 - Raj: Totally. What’s wrong with cap sleeves? If you have the right figure for it, they’re adorable.\\
27 - Credits sequence.\\
28 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
29 - Leonard: Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?\\
30 - Amy: Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.\\
31 - Sheldon: She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.\\
32 - Amy: It’s hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious, and yet somehow you do it.\\
33 - Howard: That’s fun to have in a lunchroom.\\
34 - Amy: The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat you’re going to feed it to, and maybe you choose the beady-eyed little mother who’s been biting you all week.\\
35 - Howard: Please, we’re eating. Can we get that off the table and change the subject?\\
36 - Sheldon: Can we? Stand back while I turn this conversation into a conver-sensation.\\
37 - Leonard: This time, it’s your fault.\\
38 - Sheldon: I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke, come on, people, it’s just a giant thistle, to zzz, the onamona-poetry of sleep.\\
39 - Leonard: Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?\\
40 - Amy: I don’t know, four or five years.\\
41 - Leonard: No, it’s not gonna do it.\\
42 - Howard: Oy. Bernadette keeps texting me pictures of Penny in bridesmaid dresses.\\
43 - Amy: They’re out shopping right now?\\
44 - Howard: Yeah.\\
45 - Amy: Just the two of them?\\
46 - Howard: I guess.\\
47 - Amy: That’s cool, that’s cool.\\
48 - Howard: Why are they asking me about this stuff? What guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is? (Raj raises his hand)\\
49 - Scene: The apartment. Leonard is horseracing on a Kinnect game.\\
50 - Leonard: Leonard’s coming down the home stretch! Come on, horsey, you can do this! Damn. Come on, thigh muscles, you can do this! Yes! First place. I would have been a great jockey if I weren’t too tall. And scared of horses. Sheldon, you’re up.\\
51 - Sheldon: What?\\
52 - Leonard: Come on, it’s your turn. We said we’d get more fresh air.\\
53 - Sheldon: Sorry. I’m a little distracted. I can’t seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall, texting her, nothing.\\
54 - Leonard: Did you try calling her on the telephone?\\
55 - Sheldon: The telephone. You know, Leonard, in your own simple way, you may be the wisest of us all. Voice mail. Curiouser and curiouser.\\
56 - Leonard: If you’re worried, we can go over there and see if she’s all right.\\
57 - Sheldon: Okay. You know, I heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood.\\
58 - Leonard: I don’t think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.\\
59 - Sheldon: Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?\\
60 - Leonard: You do?\\
61 - Sheldon: Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item. Now, thanks to you, I’m worried Amy’s been eaten by a bobcat.\\
62 - Leonard: Forget about the bobcat.\\
63 - Sheldon: How can I? You won’t stop talking about it.\\
64 - Scene: Amy’s apartment. Amy is playing the harp.\\
65 - Amy (singing): Everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries. Everybody hurts, sometimes.\\
66 - Sheldon (outside): She sounds weepy. I don’t like weepy. Let’s go.\\
67 - Leonard: Uh, she’s your friend. Step up.\\
68 - Leonard: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Bye.\\
69 - Sheldon: Where are you going?\\
70 - Leonard: I’m single, I don’t need this crap.\\
71 - Amy: Sheldon, what are you doing here?\\
72 - Sheldon: You didn’t respond to any of my electronic communications.\\
73 - Amy: I wanted to be alone.\\
74 - Sheldon: Would you like to talk about it? And keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.\\
75 - Amy: Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me.\\
76 - Sheldon: Point of order. As you’re in distress, it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But I’m a guest in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?\\
77 - Amy: It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters.\\
78 - Sheldon: If you’d like to take your mind off what’s troubling you, uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted.\\
79 - Amy: Penny and Bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses without me.\\
80 - Sheldon: And that made you feel sad?\\
81 - Amy: Yes.\\
82 - Sheldon: I knew it. Just keep going, I guess I’m good at this.\\
83 - Amy: It’s just, I thought they liked hanging out with me, but I guess I was fooling myself.\\
84 - Sheldon: When they were over here, did you fail to offer them a beverage? ‘Cause I can see how that could stick in someone’s craw.\\
85 - Amy: Sheldon, I’m going to ask you something, and I’d like you to keep an open mind.\\
86 - Sheldon: Always.\\
87 - Amy: At this moment, I find myself craving human intimacy and physical contact.\\
88 - Sheldon: Oh, boy. You know ours is a relationship of the mind.\\
89 - Amy: Proposal. One wild night of torrid lovemaking that soothes my soul and inflames my loins.\\
90 - Sheldon: Counterproposal. I will gently stroke your head and repeat, aw, who’s a good Amy.\\
91 - Amy: How about this? French kissing, seven minutes in heaven culminating in second base.\\
92 - Sheldon: Neck massage, then you get me that beverage.\\
93 - Amy: We cuddle. Final offer.\\
94 - Sheldon: Very well. Oh, boy. (They cuddle, awkwardly.)\\
95 - Amy: I’m just saying, second base is right there.\\
96 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
97 - Raj: Mm, I’m thinking about adopting some quirky affectation, like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache.\\
98 - Leonard: For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man?\\
99 - Raj: This is not a safe place. You can’t share anything here.\\
100 - Sheldon: The two of you need to get your women in line!\\
101 - Howard: What?\\
102 - Sheldon: Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego Death Star. And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory or my Lego fun time.\\
103 - Howard: What do you want us to do about it?\\
104 - Sheldon: You clearly weren’t listening to my topic sentence, get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and set things right. I am a man of science, not someone’s snuggle bunny!\\
105 - Leonard: Why do I have to talk to Penny? She’s not my girlfriend.\\
106 - Sheldon: You invited her to lunch four years ago. Everything about her is on you, you make it so!\\
107 - Scene: The apartment.\\
108 - Leonard: Moo-shu is Penny.\\
109 - Penny: Thank you. Where’s Sheldon?\\
110 - Leonard: Oh, he was up late last night, so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed.\\
111 - Bernadette: That’s so sweet.\\
112 - Leonard: Yeah, but now he’s gonna be up at dawn and want to play.\\
113 - Howard: So, listen, guys, the reason he was up late is because he was taking care of Amy. She’s kind of upset.\\
114 - Penny: Why?\\
115 - Leonard: Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.\\
116 - Bernadette: I told you that would happen.\\
117 - Penny: Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid and she’s just getting a little crazy with it.\\
118 - Bernadette: She keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions in other cultures, and they’re all about getting naked and washing each other.\\
119 - Penny: Yeah, and she keeps trying to figure out if our cycles have synced up so we can call ourselves the Three Menstra-teers\\
120 - Bernadette: We thought it would be easier to look at dresses one time without her. I feel terrible.\\
121 - Penny: I know. Me, too. We’ll talk to her. Hey, wait, how did she find out?\\
122 - Howard: Raj did it. And he says he would do it again. Okay, I’m sorry. You sent me the picture, I wasn’t thinking.\\
123 - Bernadette: Oh, Howie.\\
124 - Howard: Well, hey, I’m usually pretty good at not blabbing. You tell me tons of stuff about these guys, and I never repeat it.\\
125 - Penny: What do you tell him?\\
126 - Bernadette: Oh, you know, just pillow talk. You guys have nothing to worry about.\\
127 - Leonard: Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?\\
128 - Penny: No. All your little secrets are fine.\\
129 - Bernadette: Yes, absolutely fine.\\
130 - Howard (after Raj whispers to him): I’ll tell you later.\\
131 - Scene: Amy’s lab. Amy is dissecting a brain.\\
132 - Amy: Come on, tumour. Come on, tumour, Mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma. Yay, brain tumour! Probably not the same reaction you had when you got the news.\\
133 - Penny: Hi.\\
134 - Bernadette: Hello.\\
135 - Amy: What are you doing here?\\
136 - Penny: Well, look, we just wanted to apologize for not bringing you with us the other day.\\
137 - Amy: That’s not necessary, it’s like Sesame Street says, one of these things is not like the other, one of these things should die alone.\\
138 - Penny: Look, come on, Amy, look, let us make it up to you. We’ll have a girl’s night, we’ll do whatever you want.\\
139 - Bernadette: We can go down to the Korean baths and do that thing you were talking about where we wash each other.\\
140 - Penny: With-with loofah mitts, no hands.\\
141 - Amy: It’s okay. I’m glad this happened. I can stop pretending that some beautiful girl and her cute-in-\\
142 - the-right-light friend want to hang out with me.\\
143 - Bernadette: Amy, we’re really sorry.\\
144 - Penny: Yeah, we feel awful.\\
145 - Amy: Don’t. I’ll be okay. You’re not the first girls I thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me. It’s like elementary school, junior high, high school, undergrad, grad school, and that semester abroad in Norway all over again.\\
146 - Penny: Oh, come on, Amy.\\
147 - Amy: You don’t get it. Look at this brain.\\
148 - Penny: I don’t really want to.\\
149 - Amy: This is us. Bernadette, you are the analytical, scientific left hemisphere. Penny, you’re the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere. And where’s Amy? She’s right here, the sad little tumour no one wants to go dress shopping with.\\
150 - Bernadette: Amy, you’re not a tumour. Penny, tell her she’s not a tumour. (Penny is vomiting in the dustbin). \\
151 - Scene: The apartment, Sheldon is building his Lego Death Star. Phone rings.\\
152 - Sheldon: Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he proposed answering it with ahoy? Ahoy. I like it. Amy? Is that you? Have you been drinking? I’m sorry, I bet my sweet what? Well, all right. We’re on our way.\\
153 - Leonard: What’s going on?\\
154 - Sheldon: It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.\\
155 - Leonard: Really? Amy?\\
156 - Sheldon: Leonard, be glad you can’t keep a woman. They are a handful.\\
157 - Scene: A liquor store parking lot.\\
158 - Amy: Oh, look. It’s Sheldon and little Leonard. Hi, little Leonard.\\
159 - Leonard: Hi, Amy.\\
160 - Amy: Hey, Cuddles.\\
161 - Leonard: Cuddles?\\
162 - Sheldon: Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled. Grow up, Leonard.\\
163 - Leonard: Amy, what are you doing here?\\
164 - Amy: Well, I came here to get a bottle of wine like Penny taught me to do when you’re sad.\\
165 - Leonard: Yeah, but why didn’t you go back to your apartment?\\
166 - Amy: Didn’t you go to high school, Leonard? Parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out. Not that the rat bastards ever invited me.\\
167 - Leonard: Maybe we should get you home.\\
168 - Amy: Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon, what would it take for you to go into that liquor store, buy a bottle of hooch, take me across the street to that motel, and have your way with me?\\
169 - Leonard: Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?\\
170 - Sheldon: I’m begging both of you, please, let’s go.\\
171 - Leonard: Okay. Come on. Upsy-daisy.\\
172 - Amy: Whee! Ooh, finally someone found second base.\\
173 - Scene: Amy’s lab. She is dissecting a brain.\\
174 - Amy: I know how you feel. I got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe, too.\\
175 - Penny: Hi.\\
176 - Amy: What do you want? Do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?\\
177 - Penny: I never gave you a friendship bracelet.\\
178 - Amy: When we first met, I made one and pretended you gave it to me. You can have it back if you want.\\
179 - Penny: No, you made that for you, I want you to have it.\\
180 - Bernadette: We know you’re upset, and you have every right to be, but if it’s okay with you, we’d like a second chance to make things right.\\
181 - Penny: We are really sorry, and we were trying to think of some way to show you how much we care about you.\\
182 - Bernadette: Which is why it would mean so much if you would agree to be the maid of honour at my wedding.\\
183 - Amy: What? Wait, is this some kind of practical joke? Like in Norway, when my friends trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?\\
184 - Bernadette: No. I, I want you to be the maid of honour.\\
185 - Amy: Oh, my gosh. No one’s every asked me to be the maid of honour before. Well, that’s not true. Once, but then they all died.\\
186 - Bernadette: So is that a yes?\\
187 - Amy: Yes. Yes. Oh, my gosh, I, I have so much to do. There’s the bridal shower and the bachelorette party. What should we do for the bachelorette party? Oh, I know, we’ll go to a Native American sweat lodge, we’ll take peyote, roll around in the mud, and paint fertility symbols on Bernadette’s naked body. So that’s happening.\\
188 - Penny: Yeah, sure, sure. Vegas is fun, too.\\
189 - Amy: I feel like crying. Of course, I could just be hormonal. Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are finally syncing up. Bernadette? No? Penny?\\
190 - Penny: Sorry.\\
191 - Amy: Really?\\
192 - Penny: Okay, yeah.\\
193 - Amy: Yay!\\
194 - Scene: A bridal store.\\
195 - Amy: Maid of honour Amy Farrah Fowler’s amazing behind-the-scenes wedding video, take one.\\
196 - Bernadette: We’re just trying on dresses, do we really need to record this?\\
197 - Amy: I’m sorry, are you the maid of honour?\\
198 - Bernadette: I am the bride.\\
199 - Amy: So no. And action.\\
200 - Penny (in a red bridesmaid dress): What do you think?\\
201 - Bernadette: I love it!\\
202 - Amy: What are you, a nun? Come on, bestie, let’s see some skin.\\
203 - Cut to Amy in a lilac dress.\\
204 - Bernadette: Oh, Amy! Looking sexy!\\
205 - Amy: You think they don’t have mirrors in there? I know how I look.\\
206 - Cut to Bernadette in a wedding dress.\\
207 - Penny: Oh! Bernadette, you look beautiful!\\
208 - Amy: You do.\\
209 - Bernadette: Thank you.\\
210 - Amy: Not Penny beautiful, but beautiful.\\
211 - Cut to changing room door.\\
212 - Amy: Come on, bestie, you’re up.\\
213 - Penny (off): Give me a minute.\\
214 - Amy: What is taking you so long? (Opens door. Penny is in her underwear)\\
215 - Penny: Oh, Amy! Get the hell out of here!\\
216 - Amy: – Sorry, sorry. (Swings camera away. Then back again)\\
217 - Penny: Oh, God. Amy!\\
218 - Amy: Sorry.
\subsection {Episode 09: The Ornithophobia Diffusion}
1 - Scene: The lobby.\\
2 - Penny: Hey.\\
3 - Leonard: Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?\\
4 - Penny: Yeah. I’ve got eight pounds of salmon that’s about to go bad. Do you know how to cook it?\\
5 - Leonard: Not really.\\
6 - Penny: Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken. What are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?\\
7 - Leonard: Star Wars on Blu-ray.\\
8 - Penny: Haven’t you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?\\
9 - Leonard: Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.\\
10 - Penny: Oh, Leonard.\\
11 - Leonard: I know, it’s high-resolution sadness.\\
12 - Penny: Well, I’m going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?\\
13 - Leonard: Really? Do we do that?\\
14 - Penny: What do you mean?\\
15 - Leonard: You know, we haven’t spent time alone together since we broke up.\\
16 - Penny: Oh, it’s not a date, Leonard. It’s just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having s*x at the end of the night.\\
17 - Leonard: Sounds like most of my dates.\\
18 - Sheldon (off, voice heard through apartment door as they approach): Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!\\
19 - Penny: What is that about?\\
20 - Leonard: Well, he’s smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster. (They enter. Sheldon is by the window.)\\
21 - Sheldon: Shoo, shoo! Be gone!\\
22 - Leonard: What the hell is going on?\\
23 - Sheldon: There’s a bird outside the window, and he won’t go away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or seeds here. Shoo, shoo.\\
24 - Penny: Really? On top of everything else, you’re afraid of birds?\\
25 - Sheldon: It’s called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets.\\
26 - Penny: So movies, yes or no?\\
27 - Leonard: Movies, yes.\\
28 - Penny: Great. I’ll see you later. And remember, he’s more afraid of you than you are of him.\\
29 - Sheldon: That doesn’t help.\\
30 - Penny: No, I was talking to the bird.\\
31 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird. (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird. (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird.\\
32 - Leonard: Sheldon, just ignore him.\\
33 - Sheldon: Good idea. Attention is what birds want. (Pulls curtain) Oh, much better. All right. Now I’ll just get along with my life. (Bird squawks) Make a pot of tea, Leonard. It’s going to be a long night.\\
34 - Credits sequence.\\
35 - Scene: The apartment.Sheldon is trying to scare the bird away making cat noises.\\
36 - Leonard: The bird’s still there?\\
37 - Sheldon: Quick, what does a hawk sound like?\\
38 - Leonard: I don’t know. Scree-scree.\\
39 - Sheldon: Please, that’s a seagull. If you’re not going to help, don’t help.\\
40 - Leonard: Sorry. Do you think I’m overdressed?\\
41 - Sheldon: It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam, yes. If you’re playing Vegas, I’d add sequins.\\
42 - Leonard: I’m going to the movies with Penny. I don’t want her to think that I think it’s a date.\\
43 - Sheldon: Do you think it’s a date?\\
44 - Leonard: No, but she might think I think it’s a date even though I don’t.\\
45 - Sheldon: Or you might think she thinks you think it’s a date even though she doesn’t.\\
46 - Leonard: Are we overthinking this?\\
47 - Sheldon: Not at all.\\
48 - Leonard: You’re right. I’m fine. I’m wearing this.\\
49 - Sheldon: Really? A blazer? All right. (Leonard takes off blazer and heads back to his room. Sheldon dials phone) Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, I’d like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I’m sorry, this is Animal Control. I don’t understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you’re frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you’re stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don’t you think I tried making cat noises?\\
50 - Leonard (returning in a tee shirt and backwards cap): Too casual?\\
51 - Sheldon: For an audience with the queen, yes. For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great. (Leonard leaves again. Sheldon draws a picture of a cats face and returns to making cat noises at the window.) What am I thinking? Whiskers!\\
52 - Scene: The cinema.\\
53 - Penny: Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie.\\
54 - Leonard: Oh, yeah, sure. There’s also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America.\\
55 - Penny: Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston, and she’s not building a dam.\\
56 - Leonard: Can’t argue with that. I’ll get the tickets.\\
57 - Penny: Okay.\\
58 - Leonard: Actually, you know what? I think it’s about time I pick a movie we see.\\
59 - Penny: You pick plenty of movies.\\
60 - Leonard: No. You always picked, and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along.\\
61 - Penny: But come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes.\\
62 - Leonard: I hate those movies.\\
63 - Penny: No, you don’t.\\
64 - Leonard: Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have s*x. To this day, I can’t see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused.\\
65 - Penny: Okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have s*x with me?\\
66 - Leonard: All the time.\\
67 - Penny: You’re kidding.\\
68 - Leonard: Does this sound familiar? I’d love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It’s great. It’s two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn’t?\\
69 - Penny: Okay, we were going out. You were going to get s*x anyway.\\
70 - Leonard: Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?\\
71 - Penny: No. No woman would.\\
72 - Leonard: See? Now, that’s the great thing. We’re out as friends. This is not a date. s*x is off the table. So, let’s go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert.\\
73 - Penny: All right, fine.\\
74 - Leonard: Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.\\
75 - Scene: The apartment.\\
76 - Raj: Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars.\\
77 - Howard: I’m pushing play.\\
78 - Sheldon: A minute.\\
79 - Howard: If we don’t start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again.\\
80 - Sheldon: This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.\\
81 - Howard: I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.\\
82 - Sheldon: Yeah, but you’ve got a can-do attitude and that’s what’s important.\\
83 - Raj: I really don’t get your problem with birds.\\
84 - Sheldon: The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? My first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup.\\
85 - Raj: Hummingbirds are pretty.\\
86 - Sheldon: Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.\\
87 - Raj: Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin, I go back and forth.\\
88 - Sheldon: Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. Age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?\\
89 - Raj: Yes, please. This is way better than the movie.\\
90 - Howard: All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready.\\
91 - Sheldon: It’s not a death ray. It’s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldn’t be living here. I’d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right, and in three, two, one. (Switches on. All the windows shatter. The bird doesn’t move.)\\
92 - Raj: That is one tough birdie.\\
93 - Scene: A bar.\\
94 - Leonard: Come on, you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate.\\
95 - Penny: No, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can’t.\\
96 - Leonard: I’m going to get some fries. You want anything?\\
97 - Penny: Uh, no, thanks.\\
98 - Leonard: Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries.\\
99 - Penny: I just eat the little crispy ones you don’t like.\\
100 - Leonard: No, I love them. I save them for the end, but they’re gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?\\
101 - Penny: To get s*x.\\
102 - Leonard: Exactly. But this is not a date. So I ask again, would you like anything?\\
103 - Penny: All right, I’d like an order of fries.\\
104 - Leonard: Great. That’ll be five dollars. I am having the best time. I’m so glad you suggested we do this.\\
105 - Penny (accidentally nudging the man sitting behind her): Oh, sorry.\\
106 - Man: No problem.\\
107 - Penny: What you writing there?\\
108 - Man: A screenplay. Its about a guy whose roommate is having s*x and tells him go to a bar and work on his screenplay.\\
109 - Penny: I Hope Alex Gets Crabs: The Movie.\\
110 - Man: It’s a working title.\\
111 - Penny: Oh.\\
112 - Man: I’m Kevin.\\
113 - Penny: Oh. Penny. Nice to meet you.\\
114 - Kevin: I’ll let you get back to your date.\\
115 - Penny: Oh, no, no. This isn’t a date, no. Right?\\
116 - Leonard: Uh, right.\\
117 - Penny: So have you written anything I might have seen?\\
118 - Kevin: That depends. How much time do you spend on Yelp?\\
119 - Scene: The apartment.\\
120 - Sheldon: This is ridiculous. I’m a grown man from Texas. This isn’t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. It’s just a blue jay. (Opens window) That’s a pretty big blue jay. (Closes window. Goes to cabinet. Comes out wearing a Boba Fett helmet and a broom) One, two, three. (Opens window) Go! Shoo! Am-scray, ird-bay! (Bird flies in window) Bird in the apartment! Bird in the apartment! (Sees the bird sitting in his place) No!\\
121 - Scene: The bar.\\
122 - Penny (to Kevin): So it is an amazing documentary. They need the electricity from the dam, but at the same time they want to preserve the environment.\\
123 - Leonard: You’re kidding me. Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?\\
124 - Penny: Oh, yeah. Sure. Just one sec?\\
125 - Kevin: No problem.\\
126 - Penny: What’s up?\\
127 - Leonard: I know what you’re doing.\\
128 - Penny: What am I doing?\\
129 - Leonard: You’re going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren’t on a date.\\
130 - Penny: No, I’m talking to him because he’s cute.\\
131 - Leonard: Come on, he’s not that cute.\\
132 - Penny: Yes, he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses.\\
133 - Leonard: I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.\\
134 - Penny: Yes, but when you’re tall and have great cheekbones, you’re doing it ironically.\\
135 - Leonard: If that’s so, what if I start talking to a girl?\\
136 - Penny: You should.\\
137 - Leonard: I’m serious. I’ll do it.\\
138 - Penny: Good! Go! There are some girls right over there. What are you waiting for?\\
139 - Leonard: They’re in a group. I’m scared.\\
140 - Scene: The apartment.\\
141 - Amy: Sheldon, what do you expect us to do?\\
142 - Sheldon: You’re biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That’s a living thing, get cracking.\\
143 - Bernadette: I specialize in microorganisms, and Amy studies brains.\\
144 - Amy: Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing.\\
145 - Sheldon: Oh, come now. Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class.\\
146 - Bernadette: Come back in, Sheldon, he’s not going to hurt you. He looks friendly. I think he might be someone’s pet.\\
147 - Sheldon: No, Bernadette, don’t be a hero!\\
148 - Bernadette: Oh, he’s a sweetie.\\
149 - Sheldon: Yes. It’s very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet.\\
150 - Amy: Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. Just like you did with the mailman.\\
151 - Sheldon: Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. I’m not going to be another statistic.\\
152 - Bernadette: Look how sweet he is. Come over and say hi. Come on. You can do it. Don’t be scared. Come on. Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby!\\
153 - Sheldon: I did it! I actually did it. Okay, now flush him.\\
154 - Scene: The bar.\\
155 - Woman: So, Leonard, what do you do for fun?\\
156 - Leonard: Um, let’s see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie.\\
157 - Penny: Hey. Sorry I ditched you.\\
158 - Leonard: No, it’s fine. You can ditch away.\\
159 - Penny: Oh, no, no. We said we were going to hang out, let’s hang out.\\
160 - Leonard: It’s cool. Go back to Kevin.\\
161 - Penny: Oh, he had to leave.\\
162 - Leonard: Interesting. So now that he’s gone, you want to hang out with me.\\
163 - Woman: This must be Penny.\\
164 - Leonard: Yep.\\
165 - Woman: I totally get it.\\
166 - Penny: Huh? I’m sorry, get what?\\
167 - Leonard: Don’t worry about it. You know, there’s some guys over there. You should go talk to them.\\
168 - Penny: No, no. I want to know what you told her.\\
169 - Leonard: That’s kind of between me and…\\
170 - Woman: Laura.\\
171 - Leonard: Laura.\\
172 - Penny: Oh. Okay, I see. So while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two Star Trek uniforms?\\
173 - Laura: Really?\\
174 - Penny: Yeah. Wears them. Not just for Halloween.\\
175 - Leonard: Hey, pal. You didn’t see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter.\\
176 - Penny: Okay. Then I’ll return the favour, and I won’t tell…\\
177 - Laura: Laura.\\
178 - Penny: Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated.\\
179 - Leonard: When you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?\\
180 - Penny: Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?\\
181 - Leonard: Oh, yeah? Spell asthma.\\
182 - Penny: A… S… Take me home.\\
183 - Leonard: Maybe I’m not done hanging out with… (Laura has gone) You’re right, it’s getting late.\\
184 - Scene: The apartment. Sheldon has the bird on his arm.\\
185 - Sheldon: It’s remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He’s magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I haven’t offered you a beverage.\\
186 - Bernadette: Oh, it’s just like my grandma with her parrot. And after she lost her marbles with her remote control.\\
187 - Sheldon: My phone’s on the desk over there. Take a picture of us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar. If you were a dove, I’d call you Lovey-Dovey. Oh. Who am I kidding? This isn’t a moment for strict adherence to the literal. You’re just my little Lovey-Dovey, aren’t you?\\
188 - Amy: Guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here.\\
189 - Bernadette: I still think he looks like someone’s pet. Maybe we should put up posters.\\
190 - Sheldon: Yes. It should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? Not anymore. We’re going to have so much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite.\\
191 - Amy: If you’re keeping him, I’ve got a cage you can borrow. One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both tragic and hysterical.\\
192 - Sheldon: Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn’t sleep in a cage. No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I’m going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn’t that right, LD? (Opens window. Bird flies out.) No. Where are you going? Come back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He’s gone.\\
193 - Amy: I’m sorry, Sheldon.\\
194 - Sheldon: How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!\\
195 - Scene: The stairwell. They ascend without talking.\\
196 - Leonard: Okay. So, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night.\\
197 - Penny: Okay, I’m not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.\\
198 - Leonard: I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I’m sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it’s not like when we were going out, I’d just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I’m sorry.\\
199 - Penny: All right. Thank you. I’m sorry, too.\\
200 - Leonard: Just to be clear, s*x is off the table, right?\\
201 - Penny: Way off.\\
202 - Leonard: Maybe we’re not ready to hang out as friends.\\
203 - Penny: I don’t know. Up until the last part, I was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone. Picking the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky.\\
204 - Leonard: Really?\\
205 - Penny: Yeah.\\
206 - Leonard: Well, then, I’m putting s*x back on the table. What do you think about that?\\
207 - Penny: Ooh. Maybe I like it.\\
208 - Leonard: You do? Because if that’s what you like, I can be that guy. I swear, I’ll be anything you want me to be.\\
209 - Penny: Good night, Leonard.\\
210 - Leonard: I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.\\
211 - Sheldon: Mine was great. I’m going to be a mommy. (Reveals nest with an egg in it.)
\subsection {Episode 10: The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition}
1 - Scene: The comic book store.\\
2 - Howard: It’s amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.\\
3 - Leonard: It’s probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets.\\
4 - Howard: Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay.\\
5 - Sheldon: Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic, huh?\\
6 - Amy: Sheldon, I’m disappointed. As a brilliant man, you’re entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o.\\
7 - Sheldon: Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like that’s cool.\\
8 - Stuart: Can I help you find anything?\\
9 - Amy: A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can’t be used as a floatation device.\\
10 - Stuart: Sorry. Most of the guys who come in here like big boobs. Couple of them have big boobs.\\
11 - Raj: Hey, look, the new Warlords of Ka’a expansion pack is out.\\
12 - Howard: A new one? Unbelievable. They just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. It’s like a secret tax on guys who can’t get laid.\\
13 - Raj: They’re not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why, absurd. What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?\\
14 - Howard: Wild West and Witches? What kind of loser cares about a showdown between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?\\
15 - Raj: A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.\\
16 - Leonard: Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid’s cowboy hat?\\
17 - Howard: What? Please! This is Billy the Kid we’re talking about. I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka’a?\\
18 - Stuart: Leonard, what’s the deal with Sheldon’s friend Amy? Are they a couple?\\
19 - Leonard: Couple of weirdos. Why?\\
20 - Howard: You interested in Amy?\\
21 - Stuart: Well, I mean, she didn’t look through me with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling hatred and contempt. I like that in a woman. Could you run it by Sheldon if I could ask her out?\\
22 - Leonard: Sure. I guess.\\
23 - Raj: Stuart, settle an argument for us. Who would win, Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?\\
24 - Stuart: If I tell you that, I’m robbing you of the hours of fun you could have for the magical, rootin’ tootin’ low price of $24.95.\\
25 - Raj: I’ll take one.\\
26 - Howard: Mmm, make it two.\\
27 - Leonard: I hate all of you and myself. Three.\\
28 - Stuart: I’ll ring it up. Like shooting nerds in a barrel.\\
29 - Credits sequence.\\
30 - Scene: The apartment.\\
31 - Leonard: Hey, can I talk to you about something? It’s a little awkward.\\
32 - Sheldon: I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill you’re at, you’re wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don’t have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that.\\
33 - Leonard: Yeah, that’s not it. Stuart’s kind of interested in Amy.\\
34 - Sheldon: Oh, of course he is. She’s very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?\\
35 - Leonard: No. He wanted me to find out if you’d have a problem with him asking her out.\\
36 - Sheldon: I’m not sure how to respond, Leonard. I don’t own Amy. Can’t own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard, if you’re going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you’ll have to know.\\
37 - Leonard: You know what? Never mind. I’m going to tell him it’s okay to ask her out.\\
38 - Sheldon: The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.\\
39 - Leonard: All right, but just for the record, I checked in with you to see how you’d feel about it.\\
40 - Sheldon: Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist.\\
41 - Leonard: I am not washed-up.\\
42 - Sheldon: Oh, Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can’t until you admit the problem.\\
43 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
44 - Penny: Well, ladies, we killed the bottle.\\
45 - Amy: I had half a glass.\\
46 - Bernadette: I didn’t have any.\\
47 - Penny: Okay, don’t judge me. So, what do you want to do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?\\
48 - Amy: Or we play Travel Twister.\\
49 - Bernadette: Amy, really? Twister?\\
50 - Amy: Excuse me. I’ve passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game. And I’m sure it’s a lot more exciting when you play with other people. What do you say, bestie? We can do shirts and skins. I’m shirts. Called it.\\
51 - Bernadette: I’m too small for Twister. And roller coasters. And sitting with my feet on the floor. Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom.\\
52 - Penny: Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine. Hey, look, I have peach schnapps. Thank God.\\
53 - Amy (reading a text on her phone): Guys, something happened.\\
54 - Penny: What’s wrong?\\
55 - Amy: I think a boy likes me.\\
56 - Bernadette (reading): Hi. It’s Stuart. We met at the comic book store. I was wondering if you’d like to get coffee sometime. It’s okay if you say no. It might be the kick in the pants I need to start taking Zoloft.\\
57 - Penny: Amy, little vixen. Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester.\\
58 - Bernadette: What are you going to do? Doesn’t he know you have a boyfriend?\\
59 - Penny: Oh, she doesn’t have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon. So do you like Stuart?\\
60 - Amy: I don’t know. He’s nice. He’s funny. He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland. That’s kind of hot.\\
61 - Penny: Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you’ve been with him over a year now. If it’s not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?\\
62 - Bernadette: Well, yeah, I guess they’re not engaged like me and Howie.\\
63 - Penny: Yeah, for what it’s worth, engaged people can look around, too. Lot of options out there.\\
64 - Scene: The comic book store.\\
65 - Sheldon: Where’s Stuart?\\
66 - Speccy Guy Behind Counter (sniggering): Out.\\
67 - Sheldon: Who are you?\\
68 - Speccy Guy: I’m Dale. He left me in charge.\\
69 - Leonard: Really?\\
70 - Dale: Yeah. I don’t get it, either.\\
71 - Leonard: I want to return this Wild West and Witches Ka’a expansion pack.\\
72 - Dale: Sorry. I don’t do returns. They’re hard.\\
73 - Leonard: Sure, sure. Uh, when will Stuart be back?\\
74 - Dale: I don’t know. He went out for coffee. With a girl.\\
75 - Sheldon: Oh, I guess I was wrong.\\
76 - Leonard: You okay?\\
77 - Sheldon: Am I okay? Leonard, I’m on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?\\
78 - Dale: I’m okay, too!\\
79 - Scene: The apartment. They are playing Warlords of Ka’a.\\
80 - Raj: Wild Bill Witchcock.\\
81 - Leonard: A tribe of Abra-Comanches.\\
82 - Sheldon: Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, I’m very disappointed in you cowpokes. We’re playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches, and I’m the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion. (Spits into a spittoon) Patooie.\\
83 - Howard: We’re not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon. It looks ridiculous.\\
84 - Sheldon: And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?\\
85 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
86 - Howard: Very.\\
87 - Raj: Incredibly so.\\
88 - Sheldon: Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?\\
89 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
90 - Howard: Very.\\
91 - Raj: Incredibly so.\\
92 - Sheldon: All right, fine. Let’s just play.\\
93 - Leonard: We should go easy on him. Amy’s out with Stuart tonight.\\
94 - Howard: Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Sheldon’s patented blend of condescension and no s*x isn’t enough to hold on to a woman?\\
95 - Sheldon: Cluck, cluck, cluck. What are we, ladies at a quilting bee? Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?\\
96 - Howard: Sorry. Creepy Tepee.\\
97 - Raj: Annie Ogly.\\
98 - Leonard: Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.\\
99 - Sheldon: And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me. I think you need to ask yourselves who’s really being ridiculous here. (Walks away with spurs jangling)\\
100 - Leonard: It’s you.\\
101 - Howard: You are.\\
102 - Raj: Totally you.\\
103 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
104 - Raj: Hey, guys, check it out. The deluxe limited edition Wild West and Witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector’s tin.\\
105 - Leonard: Oh come on, no! We just bought the regular pack.\\
106 - Howard: Ooh, a sheriff’s badge.\\
107 - Raj: Yeah, it’s also a wand.\\
108 - Leonard: With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?\\
109 - Sheldon: I’m in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything.\\
110 - Leonard: You’ve got to be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook?\\
111 - Howard: I thought you didn’t like Facebook anymore.\\
112 - Sheldon: Don’t be silly. I’m a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.\\
113 - Raj: Please. You’re looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.\\
114 - Sheldon: Really? You think I care if a man, what, shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?\\
115 - Raj: You’re so full of it.\\
116 - Sheldon: You are free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.\\
117 - Raj: You unfriended me? Seriously?\\
118 - Howard: Oh, yeah. Now he’s gonna miss all those great updates like, I can’t believe I waited this long to make my own potpourri.\\
119 - Leonard: Sheldon, why don’t you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don’t want her going out with other men?\\
120 - Sheldon: And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.\\
121 - Howard: Here’s a radical thought. Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight. I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed.\\
122 - Sheldon: And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.\\
123 - Leonard: That’s all of us. Can I use the laptop?\\
124 - Sheldon: Why?\\
125 - Leonard: I have to buy that stupid collector’s tin.\\
126 - Scene: Penny’s apartment door. Sheldon knocks three times.\\
127 - Penny (off): Who do we love?\\
128 - Sheldon: Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)\\
129 - Penny (off): Who do we love?\\
130 - Sheldon: Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)\\
131 - Penny (off): Who do we love?\\
132 - Sheldon: Penny.\\
133 - Penny: Hello, Sheldon. Come on in.\\
134 - Sheldon: Thank you.\\
135 - Penny: What’s up?\\
136 - Sheldon: I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.\\
137 - Penny: I’m sorry, what?\\
138 - Sheldon: A date. You and me. Dining, dancing, perhaps you’d like to take in a prizefight.\\
139 - Penny: God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?\\
140 - Sheldon: No. Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart? And whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.\\
141 - Penny: Okay, listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.\\
142 - Sheldon: I am not trying to get her back. But, out of curiosity, what is a way?\\
143 - Penny: All right, honey, let me tell you a story. There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt. Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it. Do you see where I’m going with this?\\
144 - Sheldon: I believe I do.\\
145 - Penny: Mm.\\
146 - Sheldon: I’m the guy.\\
147 - Penny: You’re not the guy.\\
148 - Sheldon: Are you sure? That would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time.\\
149 - Penny: I call everyone sweetie.\\
150 - Sheldon: You tramp.\\
151 - Penny: Look, Sheldon, all I’m saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy.\\
152 - Sheldon: Strap on a pair? Of what, skates?\\
153 - Penny: Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy.\\
154 - Scene: A cinema.\\
155 - Stuart: If you’re bored, you can go. I understand.\\
156 - Amy: No, I’m having a nice time.\\
157 - Stuart: Don’t patronize me.\\
158 - Sheldon: Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hi, Stuart.\\
159 - Stuart: Hi, Sheldon.\\
160 - Sheldon: Pardon me. Excuse me.\\
161 - Amy: Sheldon, what are you doing here?\\
162 - Sheldon: The thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like Stuart is repellent. No offence, Stuart.\\
163 - Stuart: None taken. Although repellent is kind of a, kind of a strong word.\\
164 - Amy: I’m sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want.\\
165 - Stuart: Um, again…\\
166 - Sheldon: Stuart, please. You’re being rude.\\
167 - Amy: Anything else?\\
168 - Sheldon: I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.\\
169 - Amy: I’m listening.\\
170 - Sheldon: With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise, I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend.\\
171 - Amy: Interesting. Now try it without the quadruple negative.\\
172 - Sheldon: You’re being impossible.\\
173 - Amy: Hi, Stuart.\\
174 - Sheldon: Fine. Amy, will you be my girlfriend?\\
175 - Amy: Yes.\\
176 - Sheldon: Well, that’s enough of that. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date. Here’s a dollar for your troubles. Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids.\\
177 - Scene: Outside Amy’s apartment.\\
178 - Stuart: So, other than you taking your relationship to the next level with another guy, this was nice.\\
179 - Amy: Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door.\\
180 - Stuart: Oh, you’re welcome.\\
181 - Sheldon (inside): (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Let’s wrap things up out there.\\
182 - Amy: Um, good night, Stuart.\\
183 - Stuart: Good night.\\
184 - Sheldon (inside): Take the hint, Stuart. The lady said good night.\\
185 - Amy: How did you get into my apartment?\\
186 - Sheldon: Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you’re my girlfriend? Good thing I drew this up.\\
187 - Amy: What’s that?\\
188 - Sheldon: I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper, here and after known as the boyfriend, and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend.\\
189 - Amy: It’s so romantic.\\
190 - Sheldon: Mutual indemnification always is. Why don’t you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp.\\
191 - Amy: Section 5: Hand-holding. Hand-holding is only allowed under the following circumstances. A: Either party is in danger of falling off a cliff, precipice or ledge. B: Either party is deserving of a hearty handshake after winning a Nobel Prize. C: Moral support during flu shots. Seems a bit restrictive.\\
192 - Sheldon: Feel free to retain a lawyer.\\
193 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. The girls are playing twister.\\
194 - Amy: Penny, I said right hand red.\\
195 - Penny (picking up wine): Yeah, I heard you. I got red.\\
196 - Amy: Bernadette, left foot yellow.\\
197 - Bernadette: We should play limbo next. No one beats me at limbo.\\
198 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette.\\
199 - Amy: That’s my boyfriend. It’s open!\\
200 - Sheldon: I got a splinter.\\
201 - Amy: What do you want me to do about it?\\
202 - Sheldon: Relationship agreement Section 4, Boo-boos and Ouchies. You have to take care of it.\\
203 - Amy: I should’ve gotten a lawyer.\\
204 - Bernadette: Looks like it’s just us playing. (Penny snores) Penny? (Penny snores louder) Penny, we’re out of wine!\\
205 - Penny (waking, bleary): You should probably drive.
\subsection {Episode 11: The Speckerman Recurrence}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Penny (entering): Hi. Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?\\
3 - Leonard: Yeah, it’s “Penny already eats our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi.” No spaces.\\
4 - Penny: Okay. If you can’t get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?\\
5 - Sheldon: I believe that you’re capable of great change. Like when I finally got you to stop saying Valentimes Day.\\
6 - Leonard: You want to hear something weird?\\
7 - Penny: Sure.\\
8 - Sheldon: In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.\\
9 - Leonard: What are you talking about?\\
10 - Sheldon: You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.\\
11 - Leonard: Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her.\\
12 - Sheldon: Oh. I thought it was a game.\\
13 - Penny: What’s yours?\\
14 - Leonard: There’s this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He’s in town and wants to have drinks.\\
15 - Sheldon: Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown. Pick.\\
16 - Leonard: Just do it, ’cause he’s not gonna let it go.\\
17 - Penny: Basketball Pope.\\
18 - Sheldon: And that’s how it’s done.\\
19 - Penny: What are you gonna do about your bully? Are you gonna see him?\\
20 - Leonard: I don’t know.\\
21 - Sheldon: Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?\\
22 - Leonard: No, that was a different guy.\\
23 - Sheldon: Was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?\\
24 - Leonard: No, that was a different, different guy.\\
25 - Sheldon: Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?\\
26 - Leonard: No.\\
27 - Sheldon: Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?\\
28 - Leonard: No, but, actually, that was this guy’s sister.\\
29 - Penny: All right, well, what do you think he wants?\\
30 - Leonard: I don’t know.\\
31 - Sheldon: You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.\\
32 - Leonard: I told you. That was a different guy.\\
33 - Penny: Hmm. That’s too bad. We could have spent New Year’s Eve waiting for the ball to drop.\\
34 - Credits sequence.\\
35 - Scene: The apartment.\\
36 - Leonard: It’s two a.m. What are you doing up?\\
37 - Sheldon: Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.\\
38 - Leonard: Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.\\
39 - Sheldon: Look at these men. They’ve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention, Leonard. Someday this could be you up there.\\
40 - Leonard: Thanks.\\
41 - Sheldon: So, what’s got you up? Did you have a bad clam?\\
42 - Leonard: I didn’t have clams.\\
43 - Sheldon: I don’t watch you 24 hours a day. I don’t know what you do.\\
44 - Leonard: It’s this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can’t decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces.\\
45 - Sheldon: Wear loafers. Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel Prize. What’s the matter, Saul? You afraid someone’s going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein’s cosmological constant?\\
46 - Leonard: You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I’m gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have s*x with my mother, and yes, I do know why I’m hitting myself.”\\
47 - Sheldon: Oh, now Perlmutter’s shaking the King’s hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf. He might have lifted it.\\
48 - Scene: Penny’s bedroom.\\
49 - Bernadette: I love this dress. How come I never see you wear it?\\
50 - Penny: ‘Cause when I wear it, it’s a shirt. So, what’s Howard doing tonight?\\
51 - Bernadette: Oh, they all went with Leonard to confront his childhood bully.\\
52 - Penny: Oh, terrific. High school quarterback against four mathletes.\\
53 - Amy: When Leonard gets back, I’d love to check his serotonin levels. Do you think he’d let me draw a syringe full of his blood?\\
54 - Penny: Hmm, he’s not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, it’ll just pour out of his nose.\\
55 - Bernadette: I don’t think I can meet the girl who was always mean to me. Tammy Bodnick. One time while I was in gym class, she stole all my clothes and left an elf costume in my locker.\\
56 - Penny: Oh, that’s awful.\\
57 - Bernadette: Worst part was, it was too big.\\
58 - Amy: That’s nothing. In ninth grade, the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion. Within six months, the nicknames began to fly. I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.\\
59 - Penny: Wow. You poor thing.\\
60 - Bernadette: What about you?\\
61 - Penny: Oh. I don’t know. I guess my school was a nice place. We didn’t really have bullies.\\
62 - Amy: Come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?\\
63 - Penny: No, we weren’t really like that. I mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight.\\
64 - Bernadette: Oh, my God, that’s awful.\\
65 - Penny: No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.\\
66 - Amy: Did Kathy Geiger laugh?\\
67 - Penny: Uh, probably. It’s hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth.\\
68 - Amy: Who would have thought Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?\\
69 - Penny: What? I was not a bully.\\
70 - Bernadette: Kind of sounds like you were. And maybe a felon.\\
71 - Amy: Shh. That’s how you wind up in a cornfield.\\
72 - Scene: A bar.\\
73 - Raj: Is that him over there?\\
74 - Leonard: No.\\
75 - Raj: How about that guy? He looks like he’d hate you.\\
76 - Leonard: You know, I can really do this by myself.\\
77 - Howard: Hey, we’re here to support you, buddy.\\
78 - Leonard: No, you’re not. You’re here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head.\\
79 - Howard: You wore underwear? You fool.\\
80 - Raj: So, have you figured out what you’re going to say to him?\\
81 - Leonard: You bet. I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school.\\
82 - Howard: That’s quite a list. I can’t read your handwriting, what’s that word?\\
83 - Leonard: Scrotum.\\
84 - Raj: What’s that one?\\
85 - Leonard: Uh, stapled.\\
86 - Jimmy (arriving): Leonard.\\
87 - Leonard: Oh, hi.\\
88 - Jimmy: Holy crap, man, it’s good to see you.\\
89 - Leonard: Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard.\\
90 - Jimmy: Hi. Fellas. Hey, can I get a beer? Wow. Look at you. Little Leonard Hofstadter. I hear you’re a big-time scientist now.\\
91 - Sheldon: And there’s the first zinger. Ouch.\\
92 - Leonard: I’m doing okay, I guess.\\
93 - Jimmy: Okay? Come on, I read online you’re a physicist at a university, you won some medal.\\
94 - Leonard: The Newcomb medal.\\
95 - Jimmy: Yeah, congratulations.\\
96 - Sheldon: Congratulations? The Newcomb medal? Oh, please. That’s the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework.\\
97 - Jimmy: From what I read, it sounded like a big deal.\\
98 - Sheldon: Oh, good Lord, are we going to stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?\\
99 - Raj: Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too.\\
100 - Sheldon: My point.\\
101 - Jimmy: You should have seen this guy back in the day. Huh? He was so little, he could fit in just about anywhere. Lockers, trash cans. Oh, man, how did you get inside that backpack?\\
102 - Leonard: Oh, I can’t take all the credit. You helped a lot.\\
103 - Jimmy: Yeah. We were practically a comedy team.\\
104 - Howard: Like the Black Death and Europe.\\
105 - Leonard: Jimmy, I’m kind of curious why you wanted to see me.\\
106 - Jimmy: Okay, here it is. I have this great money-making idea. I just need a gear head to get it to the finish line.\\
107 - Sheldon: Technically, Howard’s the gear head. Leonard’s just a dime store laser jockey.\\
108 - Leonard: What’s the idea?\\
109 - Jimmy: This is just between us, right?\\
110 - Leonard: Right.\\
111 - Jimmy: Okay. What do you think about a pair of glasses that makes any movie you want into 3D?\\
112 - Raj: That sounds amazing. First movie I’m watching, Annie.\\
113 - Howard: How exactly would these glasses work?\\
114 - Jimmy: How the hell should I know? That’s why I need a nerd.\\
115 - Leonard: I don’t think something like that’s even possible.\\
116 - Jimmy: Aw, come on, you can figure it out. You’re like the smartest guy I’ve ever known.\\
117 - Sheldon: The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even I know that was a doozy. Leonard, you can’t live in fear of this man forever.\\
118 - Leonard: Sheldon, I got this.\\
119 - Sheldon: You clearly don’t. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you’re a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity.\\
120 - Leonard: Sheldon.\\
121 - Sheldon: Leonard, I platonically love you, man, but face it, you’re a mess.\\
122 - Jimmy: I don’t understand.\\
123 - Leonard: I think what he’s trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.\\
124 - Sheldon: A little bit? The man Super Glued Hershey’s Kisses to your nipples.\\
125 - Raj: That’s funny because those aren’t the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.\\
126 - Jimmy: What is that?\\
127 - Sheldon: This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.\\
128 - Leonard: 14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind.\\
129 - Jimmy: What’s this word?\\
130 - Leonard: Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years.\\
131 - Sheldon: You really need to work on your penmanship.\\
132 - Jimmy: Oh, man, I, I don’t know what to say. I always thought we were just having some fun.\\
133 - Leonard: It wasn’t fun for me.\\
134 - Sheldon: You’re being too kind, Leonard. You ruined him.\\
135 - Leonard: Come on, guys.\\
136 - Raj: That was pretty badass, dude.\\
137 - Sheldon: I help the weak. It’s yet another way I’m exactly like Batman.\\
138 - Leonard: Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn’t the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it.\\
139 - Scene: Penny’s bedroom. Penny is on the phone.\\
140 - Penny: Anyway, I’m really sorry I made fun of your stutter in high school.\\
141 - Bernadette: You’re doing great.\\
142 - Penny: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, God, just finish the sentence. Okay, well, I’m sorry you feel that way. Bye. No one wants to hear my apologies.\\
143 - Amy: I think your mistake is doing it over the phone. If they could look into your eyes, they’d melt.\\
144 - Bernadette: Penny, it doesn’t matter what you did in the past. You’re a good person now.\\
145 - Penny: That’s easy for you to say. You weren’t just called a b-b-b-b-bitch.\\
146 - Amy: Perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism. Which word’s tripping you up? Assuage or altruism?\\
147 - Penny: Both.\\
148 - Bernadette: You’ll feel better by doing something nice for someone.\\
149 - Penny: I actually knew that.\\
150 - Amy: I never doubted you.\\
151 - Bernadette: Every other week I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.\\
152 - Penny: Ooh, I can’t do that. If I stand over a steaming pot, my hair just goes boing! What else could I do?\\
153 - Amy: There’s Habitat for Humanity, building houses for the poor.\\
154 - Penny: Okay, come on, I don’t even have my own house, I’m going to build one for someone else?\\
155 - Amy: How about donating some of your clothes?\\
156 - Penny: Oh, my God, that’s perfect. ‘Cause I have so many clothes I don’t wear, and they’re just taking up space, and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that.\\
157 - Bernadette: What about helping people?\\
158 - Penny: And helping people.\\
159 - Scene: The apartment.\\
160 - Leonard: Here’s your cocoa.\\
161 - Sheldon: Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?\\
162 - Leonard: Yes.\\
163 - Sheldon: Heated to precisely 183 degrees?\\
164 - Leonard: Yes.\\
165 - Sheldon: Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?\\
166 - Leonard: You got one for good luck. (Knock on door) I’ll get it.\\
167 - Sheldon: One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.\\
168 - Jimmy: Hey.\\
169 - Leonard: What are you doing here?\\
170 - Jimmy: I want to apologize for stapling your balls and throwing you naked in the girls’ locker room, stuffing that parrot down your pants. What’s this word?\\
171 - Leonard: Laxative.\\
172 - Jimmy: Oh, right. Junior prom. That was not cool, man. I am so, so sorry.\\
173 - Leonard: Really?\\
174 - Jimmy: Yeah. I just hope you can forgive me.\\
175 - Leonard: Uh, yeah. Sure, I guess.\\
176 - Jimmy: You’re a beautiful guy.\\
177 - Leonard: Well, yeah, thanks, Jimmy.\\
178 - Jimmy: Okay, I got to go.\\
179 - Leonard: Are you okay to drive?\\
180 - Jimmy: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I drive better drunk. You know, it makes you pay attention.\\
181 - Leonard: No, no, no, come on in. I’ll make you a cup of coffee.\\
182 - Jimmy: I wouldn’t be imposing?\\
183 - Leonard: No.\\
184 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
185 - Leonard: Sheldon, we can’t let him drive.\\
186 - Sheldon: Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.\\
187 - Leonard: You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.\\
188 - Jimmy: Not really, no. It’s funny, huh, Leonard? Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser. And now we’re reversed. You’re the winner.\\
189 - Sheldon: You’d think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.\\
190 - Jimmy: You mind if I use your bathroom?\\
191 - Leonard: Yeah, just back there.\\
192 - Howard: How about that? After all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes.\\
193 - Leonard: Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.\\
194 - Sheldon: You know what would be nice?\\
195 - Raj: What’s that?\\
196 - Sheldon: As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who’ve tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once he’s asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice, I didn’t say we should do it.\\
197 - Scene: The clothing bank.\\
198 - Penny: Ah, I feel just like Mother Teresa. Except for the virgin part. That ship sailed a long time ago.\\
199 - Bernadette: I think Mother Teresa would have washed the clothes first.\\
200 - Penny: Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room wasn’t down five flights of stairs. You know, giving really is better than receiving. I used to think it was such a cliche, but it seems to be the… oh, look at these cute jeans someone just threw away.\\
201 - Bernadette: Donated.\\
202 - Penny: Yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut.\\
203 - Bernadette: Penny.\\
204 - Penny: Come on, they would be so cute on me, and, ah, they go great with this sweater!\\
205 - Amy: I don’t think Mother Teresa… Oh, that is adorable.\\
206 - Scene: The apartment.\\
207 - Sheldon: Leonard.\\
208 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
209 - Sheldon: In case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition.\\
210 - Leonard: What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off.\\
211 - Sheldon: You’re soft. This world’s going to chew you up and spit you out.\\
212 - Jimmy (belching): When did I have tacos?\\
213 - Leonard: Morning, Jimmy.\\
214 - Sheldon: Oh, there it is, tacos.\\
215 - Jimmy: Man, I tied one on.\\
216 - Leonard: Yeah, you did. So, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. And , and, and thanks for the apology.\\
217 - Jimmy: What apology?\\
218 - Leonard: For all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school.\\
219 - Jimmy: Geez, you’re still harping on that? What a puss.\\
220 - Leonard: That’s my French toast.\\
221 - Jimmy: It’s good. You really know your way around a kitchen, Nancy.\\
222 - Sheldon: I’m not going to say I told you so, but we could have killed him.\\
223 - Leonard: I might kill him right now.\\
224 - Sheldon: The Dark Knight has your back. He’s scared, but he has your back.\\
225 - Leonard: Okay, Jimmy, it’s time for you to go.\\
226 - Jimmy: Yeah, all right, let me just finish this.\\
227 - Leonard: No, you’re done. I want you out of my apartment right now.\\
228 - Sheldon: Well said, Boy Wonder.\\
229 - Jimmy: Or what?\\
230 - Sheldon: Don’t answer that. It’s a trick question. I speak from experience.\\
231 - Leonard: I’m not afraid of you any more, Jimmy. Now get out! (Pushes him) Uh-oh.\\
232 - Scene: Running down the stairwell.\\
233 - Sheldon: You did it, Leonard, you stood up to your bully.\\
234 - Leonard: Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?\\
235 - Sheldon: I don’t need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you.\\
236 - Scene: The clothes bank.\\
237 - Bernadette: I don’t feel good about this.\\
238 - Penny: Then sit in the car and keep it running.\\
239 - Amy: You were right, a whole new load.\\
240 - Penny: Come on, yoga top. Mama needs a new yoga top.\\
241 - Amy: Check it out, Bernadette, suede boots, your size.\\
242 - Bernadette: God, they’re cute. Oh, why did they have to be cute?\\
243 - Penny: Wait, wait, wait, guys, just hang on.\\
244 - Amy: What is it, the fuzz?\\
245 - Penny: Look at us. What are we doing?\\
246 - Amy: I was gleefully following you to a life of crime, looking forward to the day we might be cell mates. I don’t know about Bernadette.\\
247 - Penny: You know, this is wrong. Let’s put everything back. Here.\\
248 - Bernadette (taking boots and running): It’s okay, I serve soup to poor people!
\subsection {Episode 12: The Shiny Trinket Maneuver}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Howard: Completely empty box. If you’d like to examine it?\\
3 - Leonard: Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.\\
4 - Howard: Little snarky there, cello lessons. And we have this completely ordinary cylinder. If you’d like to examine it?\\
5 - Raj: Ordinary, yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential.\\
6 - Sheldon: Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret.\\
7 - Leonard: Sheldon, he’s just practising for his cousin’s birthday party.\\
8 - Howard: As I was saying, empty box, empty cylinder, and, ooh, voila. (Pulls out a goldfish in a jar)\\
9 - Raj: I’m telling you, dude, there’s a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it.\\
10 - Sheldon: This is how you’re going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?\\
11 - Howard: How is this lying?\\
12 - Sheldon: A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. You’ve chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.\\
13 - Raj: Can’t you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?\\
14 - Sheldon: If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion.\\
15 - Leonard: Sheldon, he’s just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. I really don’t think they’re gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie.\\
16 - Howard: Don’t be so hard on him. It’s natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!\\
17 - Sheldon: Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose.\\
18 - Howard: How is that not amusing?\\
19 - Sheldon: It’s still there. Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security. (Storms out)\\
20 - Howard: Look, I made Sheldon disappear. Ta-da.\\
21 - Leonard: Next time, you should open with that.\\
22 - Credits sequence.\\
23 - Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.\\
24 - Penny: Ooh, look who’s out on a date. Pasadena’s favourite power couple, Shamy.\\
25 - Sheldon: And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?\\
26 - Penny: So, are we celebrating anything special tonight?\\
27 - Amy: Oh, yes. Our relationship agreement specifies that the second Thursday of every month, or the third Thursday in a month with five Thursdays, is date night.\\
28 - Penny: That is so hot.\\
29 - Sheldon: All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?\\
30 - Amy: How was your day?\\
31 - Sheldon: Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat, Bob Tahecin.\\
32 - Amy: Sounds like you hit the ground running. I have a bit of good news myself. My most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of Neuron.\\
33 - Sheldon: Ooh! Speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers.\\
34 - Amy: That’s nice. Anyway, I’ve been dreaming of this day for a long time.\\
35 - Sheldon: Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, I’m not gonna lie, feels pretty good.\\
36 - Amy: Sheldon, I’m the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field.\\
37 - Sheldon: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh, 101! Air’s getting a bit thin up here.\\
38 - Penny: So, are we ready to order?\\
39 - Amy: Give me a minute. I’m gonna go wash up.\\
40 - Sheldon: Well, that’s odd. We both washed up when we came in. It’s probably a euphemism for urination.\\
41 - Penny: Sheldon, what is wrong with you?\\
42 - Sheldon: Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I don’t know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside.\\
43 - Penny: Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal.\\
44 - Sheldon: Oh, I see why you’re confused. No, her news sounded important, but what you’re forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. That’s all about yucky, squishy things.\\
45 - Penny: Honey, she’s upset. You’re her boyfriend. You have to at least try to be excited by the things she’s excited by.\\
46 - Sheldon: What if they simply don’t excite me?\\
47 - Penny: Well, just smile and think about koalas.\\
48 - Sheldon: She’d see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, it’s this.\\
49 - Scene: Howard’s bedroom.\\
50 - Bernadette: Oh, you have a lot of magic stuff.\\
51 - Howard: Yeah. I started when I was a teenager. I thought I could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.\\
52 - Bernadette: Did it work?\\
53 - Howard: Ah, let’s just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one. Oh, look what my mom made us for the act.\\
54 - Bernadette: Ooh. I like the fabric. Where’d she get it?\\
55 - Howard: Well, she cut up one of her old bathing suits. She made these two vests and half a dozen napkins.\\
56 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Has she tried on the vest yet?\\
57 - Howard: I just gave it to her!\\
58 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): I hope it fits, she has a tricky figure! She’s short and stacked, like me!\\
59 - Howard: She’s not stacked like you, Ma! She never steps on hers!\\
60 - Bernadette: Listen, Howie, maybe I’m not the best choice to be a magician’s assistant.\\
61 - Howard: You’ll do fine. Hand me those rings? See? You nailed it.\\
62 - Bernadette: You know, i-it’s just that I’m not that comfortable with little kids.\\
63 - Howard: Well, that’s because you haven’t been around them much. This is good practice. I mean, you are gonna be a mom someday, right?\\
64 - Bernadette: Mmm, yeah, sure.\\
65 - Howard: Oh-ho-ho! I haven’t seen this trick in years. It’s called the dove pan. You let everyone see the pan is empty, but there’s a secret compartment in the lid. And then you open it and produce a live… Don’t look in there.\\
66 - Scene: The apartment.\\
67 - Leonard: Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?\\
68 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
69 - Leonard: How come you’re not doing a mission? You’re just wandering around.\\
70 - Sheldon: Had a rough night. I thought I’d go for a walk and clear my head.\\
71 - Leonard: Some people go outside and do that.\\
72 - Sheldon: It’s after nine o’clock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats.\\
73 - Leonard: You want to talk about it?\\
74 - Sheldon: No. I think I’ll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.\\
75 - Leonard: You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What’s going on?\\
76 - Sheldon: Hard as this may be to believe, it’s possible that I’m not boyfriend material.\\
77 - Leonard: Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?\\
78 - Sheldon: Amy had a fight. I was being perfectly reasonable. I’m gonna have a whiskey. Do you want anything?\\
79 - Leonard: No, I can’t. I’m playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look, I’m no expert in women.\\
80 - Sheldon: I’ll say.\\
81 - Leonard: That’s not necessary when someone’s trying to help you.\\
82 - Sheldon: I’m sorry. It’s the alcohol talking. Go on.\\
83 - Leonard: Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.\\
84 - Sheldon: Nuts to that. What else you got?\\
85 - Leonard: I don’t know what to tell you. Buy her something.\\
86 - Sheldon: How does that work?\\
87 - Leonard: Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.\\
88 - Sheldon: Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it.\\
89 - Leonard: Glad I could help.\\
90 - Sheldon: It’s appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, I’ll be glad to return the favour.\\
91 - Scene: The birthday party.\\
92 - Howard: And now, all the rings are magically linked together. My fiancee’s wearing a magic ring, too. It made all my money disappear.\\
93 - Bernadette: Oh, ah, right. (Bangs drum and cymbal) And now, the great Howdini’s next miraculous illusion.\\
94 - Child: When are we gonna have cake?\\
95 - Bernadette: After you’ve been thoroughly amazed.\\
96 - Child: But we want cake now.\\
97 - Bernadette: Well, you’re not getting cake right now, capisce?\\
98 - Howard: Okay. Okay. Now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk.\\
99 - Second child: I know how you do that trick.\\
100 - Bernadette: Do you know how to pipe down?\\
101 - Howard: Okay, we’re going to roll up this newspaper.\\
102 - Second child: It’s a fake pitcher.\\
103 - Bernadette: You got wax in your ears? The man said it’s an ordinary pitcher. Howdini.\\
104 - Howard: Okay, we’re going to stick this in here (puts newspaper into trouser waistband) and then I’m going to pour in the milk. I hope this works, because I didn’t bring a change of pants.\\
105 - Second child: Look, I Googled it. It’s a fake pitcher.\\
106 - Bernadette: That’s it. No cake for you. Anyone else want to join the No Cake Club?\\
107 - Howard: She’s just kidding, boys and girls. Everyone gets cake.\\
108 - Bernadette: Not him.\\
109 - Howard: Just give me the pitcher. Behold! Wrong pitcher.\\
110 - Scene: Bernadette’s car.\\
111 - Bernadette: I told you I’m not good with kids.\\
112 - Howard: Yes, you did. Oh, I think my crotch is starting to curdle.\\
113 - Bernadette: The thing is, my mother worked full-time. I had to take care of my brothers and sisters.\\
114 - Howard: Yeah, so?\\
115 - Bernadette: Ugh, it was horrible. With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. I don’t want to get dressed. Joey keeps spitting in my mouth. This isn’t the way Mom makes waffles. Well, okay, put your hand in here. Let’s see how you like this waffle!\\
116 - Howard: All right, settle down. Red light. Red light, red light! Okay, we’re fine.\\
117 - Bernadette: I’m sorry. I know it makes me sound like a bad person, but I just don’t like children.\\
118 - Howard: Yeah, no, we all got that. But don’t you think it’ll be different when the child is ours?\\
119 - Bernadette: Right, when it’s our kid that’s ruined my body and kept me up all night and I’ve got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years, sure, that’ll be completely different.\\
120 - Howard: Well, yeah.\\
121 - Scene: A jewellery store.\\
122 - Sheldon: I don’t think there’s anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.\\
123 - Penny: Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff.\\
124 - Sheldon: Ooh, a pocket watch.\\
125 - Penny: Okay, I don’t think Amy wants a pocket watch.\\
126 - Sheldon: No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.\\
127 - Penny: Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh, does she like bracelets?\\
128 - Sheldon: Well, she’s very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. Maybe they have a dressier version of that?\\
129 - Assistant: Well, how are we doing this afternoon? Are we looking for anything special? Perhaps a ring for the lady?\\
130 - Penny: (Snorts) Trust me, we are not a couple.\\
131 - Sheldon: Excuse me. I don’t see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. You’d be lucky to land a fella like me.\\
132 - Penny: Fine, go ahead.\\
133 - Sheldon: (Snorts) Trust me, we are not a couple.\\
134 - Assistant: My apologies. How can I help you today?\\
135 - Penny: He’s in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy her a present.\\
136 - Assistant: Great, trouble with girlfriends is what’s putting my daughter through USC.\\
137 - Penny: Ooh, are these real diamonds?\\
138 - Assistant: Yes. Channel set baguettes, 20 points total weight.\\
139 - Sheldon: Remarkable. Diamonds, crystallized carbon. Every day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire. But just because you’ve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars.\\
140 - Assistant: Actually, that’s only 750. Everything’s on sale.\\
141 - Sheldon: Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.\\
142 - Scene: The apartment. The guys are playing Donkey Kong Jenga.\\
143 - Howard: I’m still trying to wrap my mind around it. I always thought I’d be a dad someday.\\
144 - Raj: Oh, me, too. You’re so caring. I’ve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood.\\
145 - Leonard: There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj’ll have your babies, problem solved.\\
146 - Raj: Hey, just because a man shows caring for another man doesn’t mean he’s displaying the love that dare not speak its name. Did she definitely say she didn’t want kids?\\
147 - Howard: Yeah, she doesn’t like them. And from what I saw, the feeling was mutual.\\
148 - Leonard: What are you gonna do?\\
149 - Howard: I don’t know. I can’t see a life where I don’t have kids. I mean, people have kids. I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr. So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at Italian plumbers.\\
150 - Leonard: You know, there’s no guarantee even if you have kids that you’re going to like them.\\
151 - Raj: Wow, that’s rough. Where’d you get that?\\
152 - Leonard: It’s right off the dust jacket of my mom’s last book.\\
153 - Howard: Maybe me and Bernadette aren’t right for each other.\\
154 - Leonard: Look, Howard, I’d say there’s a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back.\\
155 - Howard: I don’t want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker.\\
156 - Raj: What’s your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?\\
157 - Howard: Huh, it’ll kill her. On the other hand, if I don’t give her grandchildren, that’ll kill her, too. So, either way, on the Mom front, I’m golden.\\
158 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
159 - Sheldon: What time did you tell Amy to be here?\\
160 - Penny: Eight o’clock. (Sheldon checks pocket watch) Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous.\\
161 - Sheldon: Nonsense. I look like a train conductor. Under what pretext did you lure her here?\\
162 - Penny: I said, hey, want to come over and hang out?\\
163 - Sheldon: Good, good, if you had said something clever, she might’ve gotten suspicious.\\
164 - Amy: Hey.\\
165 - Penny: Hi.\\
166 - Amy: What’s he doing here?\\
167 - Penny: Okay, he wants to talk to you.\\
168 - Amy: Well, I don’t want to talk to him. And I’m pretty disappointed in you, too. Although we both know that won’t last.\\
169 - Penny: Sheldon, you’re up.\\
170 - Sheldon: Thank you. Amy, I’d like to apologize. Your accomplishment was impressive. And I’m proud of you.\\
171 - Amy: We both know that’s your koala face.\\
172 - Sheldon: I told you.\\
173 - Penny: Okay, look, he bought you this.\\
174 - Amy: Jewellery? Seriously? Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person I have ever met. Do you really think another transparently manip..oh! It’s a tiara! A tiara! I have a tiara! Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me.\\
175 - Penny: You look beautiful.\\
176 - Amy: Of course I do, I’m a princess, and this is my tiara!\\
177 - Sheldon: You’re right, the tiara was too much.\\
178 - Scene: Howard’s bedroom.\\
179 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard! Bernadette’s… Oh, she slipped right by me.\\
180 - Bernadette: Here’s your vest back.\\
181 - Howard: You should keep it. You could wear it again sometime.\\
182 - Bernadette: Where?\\
183 - Howard: I don’t know, hunting?\\
184 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Don’t forget to talk to her about this mishegas where I don’t get grandkids!\\
185 - Howard: Don’t worry, Ma. I will, as soon as I can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue!\\
186 - Bernadette: I guess you talked to your mom, huh?\\
187 - Howard: I was upset. My mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on, if the smell of Bengay doesn’t burn your eyes.\\
188 - Bernadette: Look, it’s obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution.\\
189 - Howard: Really? That’s great. What?\\
190 - Bernadette: Well, seeing as how I make way more money than you anyway, what if I work and you stay home with the kids?\\
191 - Howard: Me?\\
192 - Bernadette: Yeah. You know, you’ll watch Barney and pull Cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates, and I’ll work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life.\\
193 - Howard: Yeah.\\
194 - Bernadette: Yay, so we’re good.\\
195 - Howard: Yeah, we’re good.\\
196 - Bernadette: You know, I don’t know if this counted as a fight, but how about some make-up s*x?\\
197 - Howard: I would love that. But what is that behind your ear? Oh, look, it’s a condom.
\subsection {Episode 13: The Recombination Hypothesis}
1 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
2 - Leonard: You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?\\
3 - Sheldon: You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?\\
4 - Leonard: Okay, let’s talk about that.\\
5 - Sheldon: As you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when it’s cold. So, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it’s slow outside. I love my mind.\\
6 - Leonard: We all do. Now, how about dinner?\\
7 - Sheldon: Oh, I would assume we’d enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each other’s tails off and grill them, they’ll just grow back. Oh! My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here! I know he wouldn’t care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded.\\
8 - Leonard (seeing Penny’s door open and the girls inside): Excuse me.\\
9 - Sheldon: Permission granted, Commander.\\
10 - Amy: Which is why the more intelligent the monkey, the more faeces they fling.\\
11 - Leonard: Excuse me, Amy. Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?\\
12 - Penny: Why, you guys going somewhere?\\
13 - Leonard: No, I mean just you and me.\\
14 - Penny: You mean, like a date?\\
15 - Leonard: Not like a date, a date.\\
16 - Amy: Ooh!\\
17 - Bernadette: Ooh!\\
18 - Penny: Um, o-okay. Sure.\\
19 - Amy: Ooh!\\
20 - Bernadette: Ooh!\\
21 - Sheldon: Oh, no! They sent the wrong Spock! Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto.\\
22 - Credits sequence.\\
23 - Scene: Penny’s bedroom.\\
24 - Bernadette: This is so exciting. If Leonard and Penny get back together, Howard and I can go on double dates with them.\\
25 - Amy: How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?\\
26 - Bernadette: Mm, uh… How’s it going in there, Penny?\\
27 - Penny: Just a sec. (Emerges in revealing slinky green dress) Too much?\\
28 - Bernadette: Yes.\\
29 - Amy: No.\\
30 - Penny: Okay, just hang on.\\
31 - Amy: You just can’t handle her raw sexuality, can you?\\
32 - Bernadette: When did you and Leonard break up?\\
33 - Penny: Uh, about two years ago.\\
34 - Bernadette: Why do you think he asked you out again?\\
35 - Penny: I don’t know.\\
36 - Amy: Maybe he’s dying. That would be so romantic.\\
37 - Penny: He’s not dying.\\
38 - Amy: Too bad. If he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines.\\
39 - Penny: How about this?\\
40 - Bernadette: Maybe.\\
41 - Amy: Come on.\\
42 - Penny: Yeah, okay, no.\\
43 - Bernadette: Do you think you’ll sleep with him tonight?\\
44 - Penny: Absolutely not. Look, we’re just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes.\\
45 - Amy: If he were dying, would you sleep with him?\\
46 - Penny: What?\\
47 - Amy: Assuming he were dying of something that couldn’t be sexually transmitted. You know, like a spear wound to the head.\\
48 - Penny: Okay, he is not dying.\\
49 - Amy: How do you know? Are you a doctor?\\
50 - Bernadette: You can make-believe, though. Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and I’m a sexy cardiologist. And the naughty part is I’m not in his HMO network.\\
51 - Penny: Screw it. I’m not gonna make a big deal out of this. It’s just dinner.\\
52 - Amy: With a dead man.\\
53 - Penny: Amy, stop it. Oh, God, I’m so nervous.\\
54 - Bernadette: Relax. You know Leonard’s always been crazy about you. It’s gonna be great.\\
55 - Penny: I know, but we’ve finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?\\
56 - Amy: Guess it’ll just be Sheldon and me going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.\\
57 - Bernadette: Sure, we’d love that. Change your clothes, we got a lot riding on this.\\
58 - Scene: The apartment. The guys are playing a board game.\\
59 - Sheldon: Mm. I want to build a road, but I need wood. Do either of you fellows have wood? (Raj and Howard snigger) I don’t understand the laughter. The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now, I have sheep; I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?\\
60 - Leonard: Okay, how do I look?\\
61 - Howard: Well, more to the point, why are you doing this?\\
62 - Leonard: What are you talking about?\\
63 - Raj: Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.\\
64 - Leonard: I didn’t defile your sister, we had a relationship.\\
65 - Raj: I heard you call her Brown Sugar. In my book, that’s defilement.\\
66 - Sheldon: You want to know my opinion?\\
67 - Leonard: Oh, boy, do I?\\
68 - Sheldon: Sarcasm?\\
69 - Howard: No.\\
70 - Sheldon: All right, then. The reason you’re fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that she’s the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother.\\
71 - Leonard: Where on earth did you get that from?\\
72 - Sheldon: It’s in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.\\
73 - Leonard: That doesn’t make it true.\\
74 - Sheldon: It’s called non-fiction for a reason, Leonard.\\
75 - Leonard: See you later.\\
76 - Raj: If they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play Leonard’s mother? Sandra Bullock.\\
77 - Howard: Why?\\
78 - Raj: Because she’s great in everything.\\
79 - Sheldon: Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?\\
80 - Scene: A restaurant.\\
81 - Leonard: So, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?\\
82 - Penny: Oh, that’s a good question. How about awkward?\\
83 - Leonard: Yeah, that sounds right.\\
84 - Penny: Yeah?\\
85 - Leonard: Hey, how about if we pretend we’re actually on a first date? See how that goes.\\
86 - Penny: Okay.\\
87 - Leonard: So, Polly, tell me about yourself.\\
88 - Penny: It’s Penny.\\
89 - Leonard: Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward.\\
90 - Penny: Okay, uh, let’s see. I’m from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, I’ve done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true. Your turn.\\
91 - Leonard: Uh, let’s see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I’ve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.\\
92 - Penny: Wow. Can they?\\
93 - Leonard: Oh, God, no. The money’s pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.\\
94 - Penny: Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?\\
95 - Leonard: Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds.\\
96 - Penny: What does that mean?\\
97 - Leonard: Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I don’t help them set up their printer.\\
98 - Penny: You are so funny.\\
99 - Leonard: Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.\\
100 - Penny: Leonard, this is nice. I’m so glad we did this.\\
101 - Leonard: Me, too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?\\
102 - Penny: Whoa. Not so fast.\\
103 - Leonard: I’m sorry, what did I say?\\
104 - Penny: Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you.\\
105 - Leonard: Oh, God.\\
106 - Penny: What?\\
107 - Leonard: You said always. You’ll always have feelings for me.\\
108 - Penny: So?\\
109 - Leonard: So, that sounds more like something you’d say if you didn’t want a relationship with someone. This isn’t working out, but I’ll always have feelings for you. I’m sorry I slept with your best friend, but I’ll always have feelings for you. Here’s the thing, Lisa, I’m into dudes now, but I’ll always have feelings for you.\\
110 - Penny: How would you say it?\\
111 - Leonard: I have feelings for you.\\
112 - Penny: It’s the same thing.\\
113 - Leonard: No, it’s not. Always made it worse.\\
114 - Penny: You’re overthinking this.\\
115 - Leonard: No, I’m not.\\
116 - Penny: Yes, you are. You always overthink things.\\
117 - Leonard: Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse.\\
118 - Penny: See, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk.\\
119 - Leonard: Well, I don’t know how you have a relationship without talking.\\
120 - Penny: Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months, we never talked. To this day, I don’t even know what TJ stands for.\\
121 - Leonard: Wait, if you guys didn’t talk, what did you… never mind, stupid question.\\
122 - Scene: The apartment.\\
123 - Sheldon: And now that I have some wood, I’m going to begin the erection of my settlement.\\
124 - Raj: He’s got to be doing this on purpose.\\
125 - Howard (as Leonard enters): Ooh, eight thirty. You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?\\
126 - Leonard: You’re thirty years old and you live with your mother.\\
127 - Raj: I guess it didn’t go well.\\
128 - Sheldon: We don’t know that. Not to a certainty. All we know is that Leonard is home.\\
129 - Howard (as Leonard groans loudly in his room): How about now?\\
130 - Sheldon: Again, not enough evidence. For all we know, he’s being murdered. Now, back to our game.\\
131 - Raj: You were in the middle of an erection.\\
132 - Sheldon: Oh, of course. It’s right here in my hand.\\
133 - Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Leonard’s phone text signal sounds.\\
134 - Leonard: What does she want from me now? (Goes to front door, where Penny is waiting) What’s up?\\
135 - Penny: Do not overthink this. (Kisses him, then leads him to her apartment.) \\
136 - Leonard: I don’t understand.\\
137 - Penny: Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.\\
138 - Leonard: Okay, but earlier it seemed like…\\
139 - Penny: No talking.\\
140 - Leonard: Even during? ‘Cause sometimes I have questions.\\
141 - Scene: Penny’s bedroom. They are in bed.\\
142 - Penny: Well, that was fun.\\
143 - Leonard: Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp.\\
144 - Penny: You hung in there, though.\\
145 - Leonard: Well, there was a lot at stake.\\
146 - Penny: So what do you want to do now?\\
147 - Leonard: Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler, but it might ruin the moment. Just, just help me out here. How does a miserable date end in s*x?\\
148 - Penny: I don’t know, it’s complicated.\\
149 - Leonard: Well, I’m a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go.\\
150 - Penny: Okay, it’s just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and I panicked.\\
151 - Leonard: Why? What are you afraid of?\\
152 - Penny: Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?\\
153 - Leonard: What if I dump you?\\
154 - Penny: Come on, be serious.\\
155 - Leonard: Well, how about if we don’t think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it’s solid, then we’ll roll it out to the public.\\
156 - Penny: So we don’t tell people we’re back together?\\
157 - Leonard: Exactly. We pretend like our date went badly.\\
158 - Penny: Well, we don’t really have to pretend.\\
159 - Leonard: And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything’s cool.\\
160 - Penny: Okay, great. Hey, I just remembered. I still got one of your inhalers.\\
161 - Leonard: I can’t believe you kept this.\\
162 - Penny: Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn’t.\\
163 - Leonard: That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes I’m gonna show you how much this means to me.\\
164 - Scene: The apartment. Leonard is sneaking back in.\\
165 - Sheldon: Leonard?\\
166 - Leonard: Yeah, hi, hi. How’s it going?\\
167 - Sheldon: Uh, can’t complain. Thanks for asking. Well, what were you doing out at three o’clock in the morning?\\
168 - Leonard: Well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?\\
169 - Sheldon: I was using the bathroom.\\
170 - Leonard: Yeah, well, so was I.\\
171 - Sheldon: Really? I didn’t see you in there.\\
172 - Leonard: Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one.\\
173 - Sheldon: Where?\\
174 - Leonard: The, the gas station across the street.\\
175 - Sheldon: In your pyjamas?\\
176 - Leonard: Yes.\\
177 - Sheldon: Without shoes?\\
178 - Leonard: Yes.\\
179 - Sheldon: On a cold winter’s night?\\
180 - Leonard: Yes.\\
181 - Sheldon: Seems unlikely. Did you bring your asthma inhaler?\\
182 - Leonard: Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.\\
183 - Sheldon: Well, then, I guess it’s plausible. Hang on a second, mister.\\
184 - Leonard: What?\\
185 - Sheldon: After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?\\
186 - Leonard: What?\\
187 - Sheldon: It’s customary, when using the rest room at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase. Did you?\\
188 - Leonard: No.\\
189 - Sheldon: Here’s two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.\\
190 - Leonard: I don’t want beef jerky.\\
191 - Sheldon: It’s not about you. It’s about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.\\
192 - Leonard: Fine.\\
193 - Sheldon: Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed.\\
194 - Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.\\
195 - Sheldon: Leonard will be here in a moment. He’s looking for a different parking space.\\
196 - Howard: Why?\\
197 - Sheldon: We were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker, and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out, I’d be obligated to do so.\\
198 - Bernadette: I’m so disappointed it didn’t work with him and Penny.\\
199 - Amy: Me, too. Out of deference to them, let’s not flaunt our happy relationship.\\
200 - Sheldon: You have a keen insight into the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler.\\
201 - Leonard: We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.\\
202 - Sheldon: Well, I doubt they’d want to talk about that, so we’re fine.\\
203 - Howard: I’m surprised to see you here after it went so badly with Penny.\\
204 - Leonard: Well, hey, we’re grown-ups. We can still be friends.\\
205 - Bernadette: Boy, I don’t know if I could be friends with Howie if we broke up.\\
206 - Howard: Why not?\\
207 - Bernadette: I’m a very vengeful person.\\
208 - Howard: Really?\\
209 - Bernadette: With access to weaponised smallpox.\\
210 - Penny: Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water. You need menus or you know what you want?\\
211 - Howard: Leonard knows what he wants, but it looks like he’s not gonna get it from you.\\
212 - Bernadette: Howard.\\
213 - Penny: No, that’s okay, Bernadette. Sometimes these things just don’t work out.\\
214 - Leonard: Yeah, it’s all good. We-We’ll always have feelings for each other.\\
215 - Bernadette: Oh, that’s nice.\\
216 - Leonard: See, she knew what always meant.\\
217 - Penny: Wow, you’re like a dog with a bone, aren’t you?\\
218 - Leonard: I’m just making a point.\\
219 - Penny: Is the point that you don’t know when to let something go?\\
220 - Sheldon: People, people, please, before you say something you both regret, I’d like to place my order.\\
221 - Penny: Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon. You know why we can’t be together? Because you always have to be right.\\
222 - Leonard: Oh, that is not true.\\
223 - Sheldon: I’ve got to go with Leonard on this. He is wrong more than anyone I know.\\
224 - Penny: You know what? I just realized I’m on a break. I’ll get someone else.\\
225 - Leonard: Well…\\
226 - Sheldon: Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over, you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship with her, because I am very, very hungry.\\
227 - Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Text signal.\\
228 - Leonard: Unbelievable. (Goes to door)\\
229 - Penny: Mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant?\\
230 - Leonard: Well, I was trying to act like we weren’t seeing each other. That was the plan, right?\\
231 - Penny: No, the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends. That’s a little hard to do when you’re always being such a tool bag.\\
232 - Leonard: You know what? I don’t have to stand here and take this crap. (Goes to Penny’s apartment.)\\
233 - Penny: The hell do you think you’re going?\\
234 - Leonard: Isn’t s*x after fighting kind of what we do now?\\
235 - Penny: Yeah, kind of, yeah.\\
236 - Scene: Penny’s bedroom.\\
237 - Leonard: What are we doing?\\
238 - Penny: What do you mean?\\
239 - Leonard: Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.\\
240 - Penny: That’s because you overthink everything.\\
241 - Sheldon’s voice: Leonard, are you listening to me? (Leonard is in the hallway with Sheldon. It is the opening scene, and Sheldon has just found his cardboard Spock.) \\
242 - Leonard: What? Yeah.\\
243 - Sheldon: This is a disaster. I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy Mr. Spock cardboard standee. Why would I feel safer with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?\\
244 - Leonard: I don’t know, he was pretty badass on Heroes.\\
245 - Sheldon: You’re right, I’ll give him a shot.\\
246 - Leonard: Hang on. Penny, do you have plans for dinner?\\
247 - Penny: Why, you guys going somewhere?\\
248 - Leonard: No, I mean just you and me.\\
249 - Amy: Ooh!\\
250 - Bernadette: Ooh!\\
251 - Penny: Uh, have you thought this through?\\
252 - Leonard: Yes, and I think we should go anyway.\\
253 - Sheldon: No, can’t do it. Sorry, Quinto, you’re going back.\\
254 - Scene: Penny’s bedroom.\\
255 - Amy: If you and Leonard get back together, Sheldon and I will finally have someone to go on double dates with.\\
256 - Bernadette: What about me and Howard?\\
257 - Amy: Fine, we can double with you, too. So insecure.\\
258 - Bernadette: Where are you guys going to eat?\\
259 - Amy: Penny?\\
260 - (In her imagination, Penny is transported to her wedding day.)\\
261 - Minister: Do you, Penny, take Leonard to be your lawful wedded husband?\\
262 - Penny (turning, heavily pregnant): Well, it’s a little late for me to start saying no, isn’t it?\\
263 - (Back in the bedroom)\\
264 - Amy: Penny?\\
265 - Penny: Sorry, just remembered I’ve got to stop by the drugstore.
\subsection {Episode 14: The Beta Test Initiation}
1 - Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is making a video.\\
2 - Sheldon: Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.\\
3 - Amy: Hang on, Dr. C. What’s vexillology?\\
4 - Sheldon: Vexillology is the study of flags.\\
5 - Amy: Cool. I think I just learned something.\\
6 - Sheldon: Did you have fun doing it?\\
7 - Amy: I’ll say.\\
8 - Sheldon: Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast, not unlike the only two-sided state flag, Oregon. Oh, look. Hello, Mr. Beaver. In future episodes, we’ll answer some burning questions. What’s the only non-rectangular flag? What animal appears most often on flags? What animal appears second most often on flags? And more.\\
9 - Amy: Sweet!\\
10 - Sheldon: Why are you waving a white flag?\\
11 - Amy: I’m surrendering to fun.\\
12 - Sheldon: Now, today’s episode of Fun with Flags is not fun, but it is important. Flags: you gotta know how to hold ‘em, you gotta know how to fold ‘em. Let’s start by identifying the parts of our flag. This edge is the hoist, and it’s used to…\\
13 - Leonard: Excuse me, sorry, excuse me.\\
14 - Sheldon: Cut. Did you not see we are rolling?\\
15 - Leonard: Sorry. I’m having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here.\\
16 - Sheldon: And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here!\\
17 - Amy: You okay?\\
18 - Sheldon: No, I’m a little rattled. But like the flag over Fort Sumter, I’m still here. And, take two. Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.\\
19 - Amy: Hang on, Dr. Cooper. What’s vexillology?\\
20 - Sheldon: Vexillology is… why is there a face on that flag?\\
21 - Amy: It’s Ferdinand T. Flag. I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.\\
22 - Sheldon: Confound it! You’re right, it’s brilliant. Let’s take it from the top.\\
23 - Credits sequence.\\
24 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
25 - Penny: That was a really nice dinner. I’m glad you asked me out again.\\
26 - Leonard: Me, too, I missed you.\\
27 - Penny: You see me all the time. You sure you just don’t miss the s*x?\\
28 - Leonard: Well, yeah, s*x with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?\\
29 - Penny: I have. You are not wrong. I just think if we’re gonna try dating again, we should take things slow.\\
30 - Leonard: Oh, I can take it slow. Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, Karen Berberick? To this day she doesn’t know we were going out. Made it easier on her when I broke things off.\\
31 - Penny: Okay, well, maybe not that slow.\\
32 - Leonard: How about this, are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?\\
33 - Penny: You know, just for fun, let’s say I’m not.\\
34 - Leonard: Before an application is released, they give it a trial run. W-We could do that. And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad, just say, hey, we found a bug, and we report it so it can be fixed.\\
35 - Penny: You mean like a beta test?\\
36 - Leonard: Well, technically, this would be an alpha test. A beta test requires people that weren’t involved in the development of the appli…\\
37 - Penny: Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?\\
38 - Leonard: No, you should. Absolutely. That was me being pedantic. That’s our first bug. You reported it. I can fix that. See? This is good.\\
39 - Penny: All right. Let’s give it a shot.\\
40 - Leonard: Great. You keep a list, I’ll keep a list. At some point, we’ll exchange.\\
41 - Penny: Okay. Good night, Leonard.\\
42 - Leonard: Night. Attaboy, Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey, I’m back.\\
43 - Sheldon: Cut! Take 47.\\
44 - Scene: Sheldon and Raj’s office.\\
45 - Sheldon: Here’s an interesting fact about flags.\\
46 - Raj: I will take that action.\\
47 - Sheldon: The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti were identical by coincidence, a fact that wasn’t discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 Olympics. And thankfully, their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of Fascism.\\
48 - Howard: Let’s see the new phone.\\
49 - Raj: I stopped on the way to work. Hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?\\
50 - Howard: Really? Me? That’s, like, the best part.\\
51 - Raj: Grab a corner. Whoa, what’s your hurry, cowboy? Savour the moment.\\
52 - Howard: Oh, yeah.\\
53 - Sheldon: Speaking of cowboys, do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag? The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra. Oh, the next classic episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags is writing itself.\\
54 - Howard: Oh, let me try the voice recognition.\\
55 - Raj: Hey, I let you peel the plastic, don’t get greedy. (To phone) Hello?\\
56 - Phone: Hello.\\
57 - Raj: What’s your name?\\
58 - Phone: My name is Siri.\\
59 - Howard: Look at that. There’s finally a woman in your life you can talk to.\\
60 - Raj: Are you single?\\
61 - Siri: I don’t have a marital status, if that’s what you’re asking.\\
62 - Raj: Yeah, you’re right, that’s too personal. We hardly know each other. How about a cup of coffee?\\
63 - Siri: I’ve found six coffee shops. Three of them are fairly close to you.\\
64 - Raj: I will see you gentlemen later.\\
65 - Howard: She is gonna break his heart.\\
66 - Scene: The apartment.\\
67 - Amy: For someone who has a machine that can travel anywhere in time and space, Doctor Who sure does have a thing for modern-day London.\\
68 - Sheldon: Careful, it’s that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year’s Who Con.\\
69 - Penny: Uh, we’re not counting this as a date, are we?\\
70 - Leonard: Um, I’m not sure, but I think the right answer here is no.\\
71 - Penny: Bug report: When a guy asks me to spend time with him, maybe he plans something a little more interesting than hanging out at home, watching TV.\\
72 - Leonard: Even Doctor Who?\\
73 - Penny: Even Doctor Who.\\
74 - Sheldon: All right, that’s it. Who Con, you’re out.\\
75 - Leonard: Okay, bug report taken. Next time I will have a better plan for our evening’s activity.\\
76 - Penny: Well, thank you. I’ll see you tomorrow.\\
77 - Leonard: Oh, wait, here, almost forgot. Here.\\
78 - Penny: What’s this?\\
79 - Leonard: My bug report to you.\\
80 - Penny: Well, that’s quite a list you got there.\\
81 - Leonard: It’s colour coded.\\
82 - Penny: Oh.\\
83 - Leonard: Uh, red means fix right away. Yellow is eh, whenever you get a chance. And green is I could probably learn to live with it. There’s a key down here at the bottom. It’s neat, huh?\\
84 - Penny: Yep.\\
85 - Leonard: So, have a good night.\\
86 - Penny: Yep.\\
87 - Leonard: Look at that. Some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard.\\
88 - Amy: What’s baffling me is what you could’ve possibly put on the list. Hair too golden? Laugh too musical? World too much a better place for her mere presence in it?\\
89 - Sheldon: How about constantly talks with food in her mouth?\\
90 - Amy: Her heart’s full of love, no one cares what’s in her mouth.\\
91 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
92 - Raj: So, Siri, what’s happening? How are you?\\
93 - Siri: I am well.\\
94 - Raj: What are you doing right now?\\
95 - Siri: What am I doing? I’m talking with you.\\
96 - Raj: You have a beautiful voice.\\
97 - Siri: Thank you, it’s nice to be appreciated.\\
98 - Raj: I bet it is. Why don’t women like me?\\
99 - Siri: Let me check on that. How about a Web search for why don’t women like me?”\\
100 - Raj: No need. I’ve already done that. Siri, do you have a last name?\\
101 - Siri: My name is Siri.\\
102 - Raj: Ah, one name. Like, uh, Cher, Madonna, Adele. All the women who rock me. My name is Rajesh, but you can call me Raj.\\
103 - Siri: Would you like me to call you Raj?\\
104 - Raj: I’d like you to call me sexy.\\
105 - Siri: From now on, I’ll call you sexy. Okay?\\
106 - Raj: Okay.\\
107 - Scene: Sheldon and Raj’s office.\\
108 - Siri, I’m in the mood for gelato.\\
109 - Siri: (chimes) I found ten restaurants whose reviews mention gelato. Seven of them are fairly close to you.\\
110 - Raj: Thank you, darling.\\
111 - Siri: You are most certainly welcome, sexy.\\
112 - Sheldon: Well done, Dr. Koothrappali.\\
113 - Raj: I’m sorry?\\
114 - Sheldon: You’ve taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine. Kudos.\\
115 - Raj: I haven’t bonded with it.\\
116 - Sheldon: Oh, no, of course. I understand. You’re afraid the world isn’t ready for your taboo love. Your secret’s safe with me.\\
117 - Raj: It’s just a phone.\\
118 - Barry Kripke: Cooper.\\
119 - Sheldon: Kripke.\\
120 - Barry: Heads up. Pwofessor Wothman urinated in the particle physics wab again, so we’re going to move up his wetirement party. Fwiday, five o’cwock, pot wuck.\\
121 - Raj: Thanks, Barry. Siri, remind me Friday morning to make my famous popovers.\\
122 - Siri: All right, I’ll remind you.\\
123 - Barry (to his own phone): You got Siwi, huh? Voice wecognition on that thing is tewible. Wook. Siwi, can you wecommend a westauwant?\\
124 - Barry’s Siri: I’m sorry, Bawwy. I don’t understand wecommend a westauwant.\\
125 - Barry: Wisten to me. Not westauwant, westauwant.\\
126 - Barry’s Siri: I don’t know what you mean by not westauwant, westauwant.\\
127 - Barry: See? Total cwap. You suck, Siwi.\\
128 - Raj: Hey, don’t talk to her like that. She’s a lady.\\
129 - Barry: Well, that wady took high-wes pictures of my junk wast night for Cwaigswist. Waiter.\\
130 - Scene: Penny’s apartment door. Leonard knocks.\\
131 - Penny: It’s open.\\
132 - Leonard: Hey. You ready to go?\\
133 - Penny: Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter.\\
134 - Leonard: Can you finish it later?\\
135 - Penny: No, I can’t. Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, we’d have more fun things to talk about if I read more.\\
136 - Leonard: Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?\\
137 - Penny: Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.\\
138 - Leonard: They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don’t they? All right. Look, just remember how this works. We don’t get mad about these things. Uh, speaking of which, I’ve addressed your bug report on my date planning. Got a really fun evening for you. It’s kind of a surprise.\\
139 - Penny: All right. Terrific. Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren’t so tall. We wouldn’t want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy.\\
140 - Leonard: Thank you.\\
141 - Penny: Yeah. Oh. Here’s my list for you, right there.\\
142 - Leonard: All right, fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion, but if it’s coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? Uh, uh, I’m sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah, never mind, it’s right here.\\
143 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
144 - Raj: Good timing. Dinner’s almost ready.\\
145 - Howard: Great.\\
146 - Bernadette: Oh, smells amazing in here.\\
147 - Howard: Yeah, what are we eating?\\
148 - Raj: Oh, an exotic little treat. I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck, and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers, two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious.\\
149 - Bernadette: Who’s Siri? Is he dating somebody new?\\
150 - Howard: Yes. His phone.\\
151 - Bernadette: Oh. Is that cute or creepy?\\
152 - Howard: Uh-huh.\\
153 - Raj: Can I pour you some wine? I think you’ll enjoy it. The traditional choice with Peking duck is a Sauvignon Blanc, but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling. I wasn’t sure, but I didn’t want to have an argument with her in the middle of Trader Joe’s. Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner? Leopard, sparkles, or to paraphrase Coco Chanel, you can never go wrong with a little black case. Siri, play some smooth jazz.\\
154 - Siri: Playing smooth jazz.\\
155 - Raj: Oh, my God, Kenny G? This woman can read me like a book. I can’t believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria.\\
156 - Bernadette: I don’t know if I want to stay.\\
157 - Scene: A shooting range.\\
158 - Penny: This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?\\
159 - Leonard: I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.\\
160 - Penny: Okay, you’re kind of really great.\\
161 - Leonard: You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?\\
162 - Penny: Okay, bug report. I just complimented you. You should take it and shut up.\\
163 - Leonard: Right. Sorry, sorry.\\
164 - Penny: And stop apologizing all the time.\\
165 - Leonard: Right. Sorry.\\
166 - Penny: All right, let’s shoot stuff. You want me to show you what to do?\\
167 - Leonard: I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto. I think I know how to handle a gat.\\
168 - Penny: Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta. (Kisses him. Leonard accidentally shoots himself in the foot.)\\
169 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
170 - Leonard: So, I’ve got a gunshot wound. That’s pretty badass.\\
171 - Penny: No, you’ve got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe.\\
172 - Leonard: Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid. Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it is medically necessary. That is the law.\\
173 - Penny: Well, thank you for a really cool evening.\\
174 - Leonard: Thank you for hiding my Star Wars socks at the emergency room. Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?\\
175 - Penny: Things are looking good.\\
176 - Leonard: So, are we still taking things slow? Because a gunshot wound today, last week, I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer. We don’t know how much time I have.\\
177 - Penny: Good night, you.\\
178 - Sheldon: Guten Tag, das YouTube. Ich bin ein Bavarian.\\
179 - Amy: Und ich bin eine pretzel!\\
180 - Sheldon: Und dis is Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun…\\
181 - Amy: Mit…\\
182 - Sheldon: Flags.\\
183 - Scene: An office suite.\\
184 - Receptionist: First door on the left.\\
185 - Raj: Thank you. (Enters a door marked “The Office of Siri” Inside is a red-headed woman sitting at a huge console desk.) \\
186 - Siri: Dave, I found six vacuum cleaner repair shops in your area. Four are fairly close to you. (To Raj) Hello, sexy. What can I help you with? If you’d like to make love to me, just tell me. (Raj tries to speak) I’m sorry. I don’t understand.\\
187 - Raj (waking from a dream): No!
\subsection {Episode 15: The Recombination Hypothesis}
1 - Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Sheldon enters in a hard hat and high-vis jacket. Sounds a klaxon on his phone.\\
2 - Leonard: Aaargh. What the hell?\\
3 - Sheldon: Emergency preparedness drill.\\
4 - Leonard: Oh, no, come on!\\
5 - Sheldon: Yeah, you know how it works. Once a quarter, keep our readiness up. Now, rise and shine, sleepy head. Half the town is probably dead.\\
6 - Leonard: I have to get a lock for my door.\\
7 - Sheldon: I think you’ll like the drill tonight. I’ve tried to make it fun. Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event. Everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by Canada. Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe.\\
8 - Leonard: Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California.\\
9 - Sheldon: Yeah, really? You think those hippies in Washington and Oregon can stop them?\\
10 - Leonard: Fine.\\
11 - Sheldon: All righty! An 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena, reducing mighty edifices to dust, engulfing the city in flames. The streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded. Oh, excellent choice. Now, put on your hard hat and safety vest.\\
12 - Leonard: Oh, fun. I get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the Village People.\\
13 - Sheldon: You make that joke every three months. I still don’t get it. Leonard, wait. What are you doing?\\
14 - Leonard: I don’t know, what am I doing?\\
15 - Sheldon: Look around you, there’s hypothetical broken glass everywhere. Really? You’re going to face Armageddon without your orthotics? All right, your choice. (Grabs him and pushes him over) Uh-oh, hypothetical aftershock!\\
16 - Leonard: Aah!\\
17 - Sheldon: And that’s why we wear hard hats.\\
18 - Credits sequence.\\
19 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
20 - Howard: Check it out, press release from NASA.\\
21 - Raj: Um, Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the International Space Station. Crew members will include Commander Tom ‘Tombo’ Johnson, astronaut Mike ‘Supernova’ Novacelik and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz.\\
22 - Howard: This is going right into my synagogue’s newsletter.\\
23 - Raj: Dude, if you’re going to be an astronaut, you need to pick a cool nickname.\\
24 - Howard: I don’t get to pick it. The other guys have to give it to me.\\
25 - Raj: Oh. If I had one, it would be Brown Dynamite.\\
26 - Howard: Are you not listening to me? The other astronauts have to give you your nickname.\\
27 - Raj: Are you not looking at me? I am Brown Dynamite. Why do you put six sugars in your coffee?\\
28 - Leonard: Because the cafeteria doesn’t offer little packets of methamphetamine.\\
29 - Howard: Emergency drill night last night, huh?\\
30 - Leonard: Uh-huh.\\
31 - Raj: How’d you do?\\
32 - Sheldon: I’ll tell you exactly how he did. Readiness: unsatisfactory. Follows direction: barely. Attitude: a little too much. Overall: not only will he probably die in a fiery inferno, his incessant whining would most certainly spoil everyone else’s day.\\
33 - Leonard: You know what, I’m so tired I can’t even think straight. I’m going home. Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?\\
34 - Sheldon: You can’t go home. You have to take me to the dentist at four o’clock.\\
35 - Leonard: Oh, can’t you take the bus to the dentist?\\
36 - Sheldon: Of course I can. It’s coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia, that’s the problem. Two years ago after a deep gum cleaning, I thought I got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico.\\
37 - Raj: They put you under for a cleaning?\\
38 - Sheldon: Yeah, they have to, I’m a biter.\\
39 - Leonard: Whatever, Sheldon. I’m exhausted. I’m not taking you to the dentist.\\
40 - Sheldon: Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under section 37B of the roommate agreement, miscellaneous duties, you are obligated to take me to the dentist. See? It’s right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.”\\
41 - Leonard: You know what, I am sick of the roommate agreement. It’s ridiculous. I’m your roommate, not your chauffeur. You know, I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena has gotten too big for its britches.\\
42 - Sheldon: Well, it has. Ask anybody.\\
43 - Leonard: I don’t care. I’m done.\\
44 - Sheldon: Hold on. Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209?\\
45 - Leonard: I don’t know what that is, but if it means I can go home and sleep, then yes.\\
46 - Sheldon: Think carefully here. Clause 209 suspends our friendship, and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials. Our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent, utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall. (Demonstrating) ‘Sup?\\
47 - Leonard: Where do I sign?\\
48 - Sheldon: Right here. Use your finger.\\
49 - Leonard: There. Done.\\
50 - Sheldon: All right. That’s it. We are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise. We are now merely acquaintances. To amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me.\\
51 - Leonard: I’m gonna go home and take a nap.\\
52 - Sheldon: Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares.\\
53 - Scene: The apartment.\\
54 - Howard: I got pretty exciting NASA news today. Next week I fly to Houston for orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills.\\
55 - Penny: What does that mean?\\
56 - Bernadette: He’s gonna learn to poop in space.\\
57 - Howard: Open the pod bay doors, HAL.\\
58 - Raj: Maybe your nickname should be Brown Dynamite.\\
59 - Sheldon: Hello, dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter.\\
60 - Leonard: ‘Sup?\\
61 - Sheldon: ‘Sup? My apologies. I would’ve been here sooner, but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it.\\
62 - Amy: I saved you a dumpling.\\
63 - Sheldon: Oh, your concern for me is touching. It will serve you well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow.\\
64 - Amy: I’m sorry, Sheldon, I’m busy. I’m right in the middle of my addiction study. I’ve got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys, and tomorrow’s the day we switch them to O’Doul’s.\\
65 - Sheldon: You’re my girlfriend and you’re not going to cater to my every need? Oh, where’d the magic go?\\
66 - Penny: Sheldon, that’s not what girlfriends are for. Although, you don’t use them for what they’re for, so what do I know?\\
67 - Bernadette: Howard doesn’t make me do his shopping, or take him to the dentist, or pick up his dry cleaning, right?\\
68 - Howard: Absolutely. But when Ma’s hips give out, you’re up, kid.\\
69 - Sheldon: Well, if Amy’s too busy, that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier, thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs, tentatively entitled You’re Welcome, Mankind. All right, then, just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake. Uh, dentist. Okay, we can circle back to that one. Um, well, who wants to take me Wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes? Anyone? Oh. That one had hoot written all over it. Um, all right, uh, dermatologist? Allergist? Podiatrist? Supercuts? Okay, okay, here’s a fun one. Um, I need a new picture frame and I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs. Who wants to spend the day with me at IKEA?\\
70 - Raj: Their meatballs are pretty good.\\
71 - Sheldon: What’s that?\\
72 - Raj: Nothing, nothing.\\
73 - Scene: The comic book store.\\
74 - Sheldon: Hello, Stuart.\\
75 - Stuart: Oh, hey, Sheldon. Can I help you find something today?\\
76 - Sheldon: No, no. I was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person.\\
77 - Stuart: Ninth?\\
78 - Sheldon: You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates. So, uh, how are you?\\
79 - Stuart: Uh, not so good. My shrink just killed himself and blamed me in the note.\\
80 - Sheldon: Great. Great. So, what’s new with your family? How’s your mother? Is she alive?\\
81 - Stuart: Yeah.\\
82 - Sheldon: And your father? Alive?\\
83 - Stuart: Yes.\\
84 - Sheldon: How about your grandparents, they alive?\\
85 - Stuart: No.\\
86 - Sheldon: Oh, I’m so sorry for your loss. On a cheerier note, I have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon. What do you say you take me over there, buddy boy?\\
87 - Stuart: I’m sorry, you want me to take you to the dentist?\\
88 - Sheldon: Yes. And now, I can’t make any promises, but that’s the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot.\\
89 - Stuart: Sheldon, I’m working. I can’t take you to the dentist. Also, and I can’t stress this enough, I don’t want to take you to the dentist.\\
90 - Sheldon: Can’t help a friend out in a time of need, huh? I see where your therapist was coming from.\\
91 - Scene: The apartment.\\
92 - Raj: Ooh, ooh! What about we make your astronaut nickname Howard “Buzz” Wolowitz?\\
93 - Howard: You can’t do Buzz. Buzz is taken.\\
94 - Raj: Buzz Lightyear is not real.\\
95 - Howard: No, that’s not what I’m talking about.\\
96 - Raj: Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?\\
97 - Howard: No.\\
98 - Raj: Okay, um, how about Crash”? Howard “Crash” Wolowitz.\\
99 - Howard: Yeah, terrific. The other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named Crash.\\
100 - Raj: All right, um, how about, oh, how about Rocket Man?\\
101 - Leonard: That’s not bad, Howard “Rocket Man” Wolowitz.\\
102 - Howard: Yeah, it’s great, but I told you, I don’t get to pick my nickname. It has to come from the other astronauts.\\
103 - Raj: Maybe there’s a way to get them to come up with it.\\
104 - Howard: Like how?\\
105 - Leonard: Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo, hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan.\\
106 - Howard: Did it work?\\
107 - Leonard: No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth. Because they took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth.\\
108 - Raj: Okay, uh, what if we make Rocket Man your ringtone, and the next time you talk to those guys, I’ll call you and they’ll hear it. Plant the seed.\\
109 - Howard: That’s actually not a terrible plan.\\
110 - Raj: They don’t call me Brown Dynamite for nothing.\\
111 - Leonard (to Sheldon, entering): ‘Sup?\\
112 - Sheldon: ‘Sup?\\
113 - Leonard: Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?\\
114 - Sheldon: Not necessary. No. I found a service that’ll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning. Mostly they cater to dogs, but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind.\\
115 - Leonard: All right, Sheldon, if you need me to take you to the dentist, I will take you to the dentist.\\
116 - Sheldon: Are you suggesting that you’ve come to your senses and wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement?\\
117 - Leonard: Absolutely. If you admit that you’re a 30-year-old man who’s incapable of functioning on his own.\\
118 - Raj: Ooh, Sock Mouth’s got him on the ropes.\\
119 - Sheldon: I will admit nothing of the sort. And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to call my dentist and see if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped.\\
120 - Scene: The apartment. Leonard is watching television. All the power goes off.\\
121 - Penny (entering): Oh, good, your power’s out, too.\\
122 - Leonard: Why is that good?\\
123 - Penny: Because last month, I sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra.\\
124 - Sheldon: Power failure. Implementing power-failure protocol.\\
125 - Leonard: What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?\\
126 - Sheldon: Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic. Anyway, it’s too bad you’re no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship, because I happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency. Please try not to see anything by this light. It’s not for you.\\
127 - Leonard: It’s just a blackout, I’m sure the power will be back on soon.\\
128 - Sheldon: And I’m sure some fool in the Donner party said the snow would stop any day now. I like to think they ate him first.\\
129 - Penny: You know, I got some candles in my apartment.\\
130 - Sheldon: But candles? During a blackout? Are you mad? That’s a fire hazard. No, Pasadena Water and Power recommends the far safer glow stick.\\
131 - Leonard (pulling out a toy lightsabre): You call that a glow stick? That is a glow stick. Come on, let’s go.\\
132 - Sheldon: Before you go, consider this. Not only do I have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system, I also have all 61 episodes of the BBC series Red Dwarf and Fiddle-Faddle. All yours if you’re willing to reinstate the roommate agreement.\\
133 - Penny: I’ve got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop.\\
134 - Sheldon: Oh, he’ll be back. Wine and a girl in the dark, he’s gonna be bored out of his mind.\\
135 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
136 - Leonard: To wine and bubble wrap. And to not having to watch Sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water.\\
137 - Penny: You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dinisha said you could do that with panty hose. Boy, was she wrong. Anyway, you want to make out?\\
138 - Leonard: I thought because our relationship’s in a beta test, you wanted to take things slow.\\
139 - Penny: Okay. Do you want to make out slow?\\
140 - Leonard: I can go so slow it’ll be like there’s a snail in your mouth.\\
141 - Penny: Ugh. Well, lucky for you, there’s nothing else to do right now.\\
142 - Sheldon: Excuse me, Leonard.\\
143 - Leonard: Since when don’t you knock? It’s like the only good thing about you.\\
144 - Sheldon: Social niceties have been suspended, Leonard. We’re in a state of a emergency. The world has descended into darkened turmoil. Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day.\\
145 - Leonard: Fine, what is it?\\
146 - Sheldon: I’m making s’mores. I wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.\\
147 - Leonard: S’mores, huh? Good for you.\\
148 - Sheldon: Yes, or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement.\\
149 - Leonard: No, thanks. I’m good.\\
150 - Sheldon: Really? Huh! Okay. In that case, I will have a s’more by myself. And then I’m gonna have s’more. By myself.\\
151 - Penny: Aw.\\
152 - Leonard: No, don’t aw him. He brought this all on himself.\\
153 - Penny: But he’s sad.\\
154 - Leonard: No, he’s crazy. Sometimes crazy looks like sad so it’ll suck you back in.\\
155 - Penny: I think he misses his little buddy.\\
156 - Leonard: Fine. But mark my words, this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over.\\
157 - Scene: The apartment.\\
158 - Leonard: I thought you said candles were dangerous.\\
159 - Sheldon: This is a Bunsen burner. I’m a scientist, I know what I’m doing. Oh, drat. (His s’more is on fire. He dunks it in a glass of water.) Aw. It took me a gallon of urine to make that water.\\
160 - Leonard: Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid. I don’t see why we can’t be friends. And I’m willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. I just don’t want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement.\\
161 - Sheldon: What are you proposing?\\
162 - Leonard: That we go back to the way things were. But when I do something for you, you show a little appreciation.\\
163 - Sheldon: And how would I do that?\\
164 - Leonard: You say thank you.\\
165 - Sheldon: Every time?\\
166 - Leonard: It’s not crazy.\\
167 - Sheldon: Counter-proposal. We reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum, in the spirit of Mother’s Day or Father’s Day, once a year, we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and imagined by you. We could call it Leonard’s Day.\\
168 - Leonard: I kind of like the sound of that.\\
169 - Sheldon: Of course you do. It’s about you, like everything else. (Lights come back on) Oh, thank goodness. I don’t think I had it in me to make another glass of water.\\
170 - Leonard: So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard’s Day?\\
171 - Sheldon: No.\\
172 - Leonard: Can I sit in your spot?\\
173 - Sheldon: No.\\
174 - Leonard: Can I control the thermostat?\\
175 - Sheldon: No.\\
176 - Leonard: Do I get a card?\\
177 - Sheldon: Of course you get a card. It’s Leonard’s Day.\\
178 - Penny: Hey, guys, the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch.\\
179 - Leonard: Really. Who do you think did that, Sheldon?\\
180 - Sheldon: Oh, I don’t know. But whoever that mystery man was, you should be eternally grateful, for without him, there would be no Leonard’s Day.\\
181 - Penny: Leonard’s Day?\\
182 - Sheldon: Oh, no pressure. Just get him a crummy card, you’re good.\\
183 - Scene: Howard’s bedroom.\\
184 - Howard: All right, test my ring tone. That really is a good song.\\
185 - Raj: Oh, yeah. There’s a reason he’s Sir Elton John. They don’t make you a knight for writing Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.\\
186 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, are you coming down for breakfast?\\
187 - Howard: Ma, I told you I have a video conference with NASA. I said don’t bother me!\\
188 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Oh! Listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut.\\
189 - Howard: Yes, please listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut. Hey, good morning.\\
190 - NASA Guy (on skype): Hey, Howard, thanks for getting up so early.\\
191 - Howard: No problem, Dr. Massimino.\\
192 - Dr Massimino: The guys here call me Mass.\\
193 - Howard: Mass. That’s a cool nickname. ‘Cause force equals mass times acceleration.\\
194 - Mass: Yeah. It’s just short for Massimino. Anyway, the plan for this morning is to go over the…\\
195 - Howard: Sorry. My phone.\\
196 - Mass: What is that? Is that Rocket Man?\\
197 - Howard: Yeah, my ring tone. Kind of my favourite song, Rocket Man.\\
198 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, your Fruit Loops are getting soggy!\\
199 - Howard: Not now!\\
200 - Mass: Who’s that?\\
201 - Howard: My mom. Sorry.\\
202 - Howard: No problem, Fruit Loops.
\subsection {Episode 16: The The Vacation Solution}
1 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
2 - Sheldon: Gentlemen, I think I’ve come up with a fun way to get young people interested in science. Physics Mad-Libs. Now, give me a number.\\
3 - Leonard: Five.\\
4 - Sheldon: Uh-huh. And an irrational constant.\\
5 - Howard: E.\\
6 - Sheldon: And a funny Greek letter.\\
7 - Raj: Gamma.\\
8 - Sheldon: I said funny.\\
9 - Raj: Upsilon?\\
10 - Sheldon: Good one. And an electrical charge.\\
11 - Leonard: Positive.\\
12 - Sheldon: Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a (laughs uncontrollably). Okay. No, no. I’ll start over. Professor (laughs again)\\
13 - Howard: I haven’t seen him laugh that hard since the day Leonard made that multiplication error.\\
14 - Sheldon: Oh, Oh, Lord, that multiplication error! He thought he carried the one. But he didn’t.\\
15 - Leonard: It’s not funny. That mistake got published.\\
16 - Sheldon: Stop! I’m going to wet myself!\\
17 - Raj: Hey, guys, guys, President Siebert is headed this way.\\
18 - Howard: I wonder what he wants.\\
19 - Leonard: Doesn’t look happy, so I’m guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon.\\
20 - Seibert: Dr. Cooper?\\
21 - Leonard: Told ya.\\
22 - Sheldon: Oh, President Siebert, I assume you’d like to respond to one of the suggestions I put in the box by your office.\\
23 - Seibert: No, and stop installing suggestion boxes everywhere.\\
24 - Sheldon: You don’t like written suggestions. You don’t like when I give them to you while we’re urinating in the men’s room. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say that you’re one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions.\\
25 - Seibert: Dr. Cooper, the physics department chair tells me you’re refusing to take your vacation.\\
26 - Sheldon: I don’t need a vacation.\\
27 - Seibert: You’re obligated to take one. And I’d also like you to know the most-often received suggestion in my suggestion box you installed without asking me is can Dr. Cooper take a vacation? Okay, settled, then. I’ll see you all on Monday, except for you.\\
28 - Sheldon: But if I don’t come into work, what am I supposed to do with myself?\\
29 - Seibert: Read, rest, travel. I hear Afghanistan is nice this time of year.\\
30 - Sheldon: Sarcasm?\\
31 - Howard: No. You should go.\\
32 - Credits sequence.\\
33 - Scene: Leonard’s car. Leonard is singing enthusiastically.\\
34 - Leonard: That tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good, good night! Tonight’s the night, uh, uh, let’s live it up, uh, I got my money, let’s spend it up…\\
35 - Sheldon (appearing in the back seat): Good Lord! Would you stop that caterwauling!\\
36 - Leonard: What the hell are you doing?\\
37 - Sheldon: Bleeding from my ears.\\
38 - Leonard: What are you doing hiding back there?\\
39 - Sheldon: I’m sneaking into work. Now, if the guard at the university asks what’s under the blanket, you tell him it’s some lobster traps.\\
40 - Leonard: Lobster traps?\\
41 - Sheldon: Yes. That’s how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse.\\
42 - Leonard: What are you going to do when you get to the university? People are going to recognize you.\\
43 - Sheldon: Will they, Leonard? (Puts on cap and long-hair wig)\\
44 - Leonard: Fine. Just get back under your blanket, and I’ll drive you there.\\
45 - Sheldon: And no more singing.\\
46 - Leonard: Fine.\\
47 - Sheldon: I have GPS on my phone. I know you turned around.\\
48 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
49 - Penny: I’m so glad you talked Howard out of having your wedding invitations in Klingon.\\
50 - Bernadette: Turn it over. I’m hoping my relatives think it’s Hebrew.\\
51 - Amy: This is really happening. I’m gonna be a maid of honour. I’m gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and, finally, I will have my special day.\\
52 - Bernadette: You mean my special day?\\
53 - Amy: They’re gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody’s head.\\
54 - Bernadette: If I ever actually ever get married.\\
55 - Penny: Why wouldn’t you?\\
56 - Bernadette: My dad. Because I make a lot more money than Howie, he’s putting a lot of pressure on me to get a pre-nup.\\
57 - Penny: Ouch.\\
58 - Bernadette: Yeah. Howie’s gonna freak out.\\
59 - Amy: Parental pressure can be daunting. I remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs. Last year, I finally gave in and let her do it.\\
60 - Bernadette: I just don’t know how I’m gonna break it to him.\\
61 - Penny: You know, I’m a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you’re in bed with him. That’s how I told my high school boyfriend I slept with his brother. That’s how I told his brother the same thing.\\
62 - Bernadette: I don’t know, I don’t want to manipulate him with s*x.\\
63 - Penny: Oh, sweetie, that’s what s*x is for.\\
64 - Amy: You know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new. In fact, the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the bride’s father. For example, you’re adorable, intelligent and a good earner. I could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose. (To Penny) You would fetch a unicorn.\\
65 - Scene: The apartment.\\
66 - Leonard: Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. What about Hawaii?\\
67 - Sheldon: Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.\\
68 - Howard: How about Florida? They’ve got Cape Canaveral, they’ve got Disney, they’ve got my Aunt Ida and the world’s largest collection of diabetic candy. Plus, if you get sweaty enough, her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride.\\
69 - Sheldon: My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child. A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach. I got the message.\\
70 - Raj: You know, if I had a week off, I’d go back to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert. I tell you, an hour on the massage table with Trevor, and you’ll feel like you were born without bones.\\
71 - Howard: I don’t think I could ever let a guy give me a massage.\\
72 - Raj: Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing X-Box?\\
73 - Sheldon: It’s like I’m living in a dictatorship. You must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life.\\
74 - Howard: I don’t think you have a good handle on dictatorships.\\
75 - Leonard: Sheldon, everybody takes vacations.\\
76 - Sheldon: One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation, but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new. He went to work in his friend’s biology lab. Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist, part of the Manhattan Project.\\
77 - Howard: Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was.\\
78 - Sheldon: Now you do, too. Oh! I have a brilliant idea. Amy’s a biologist. I’ll go work in her lab.\\
79 - Howard: Isn’t that just Feynman’s idea?\\
80 - Sheldon: Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. Now you’re an expert.\\
81 - Scene: The hallway.\\
82 - Leonard: Hey.\\
83 - Penny: Hey, you.\\
84 - Leonard: Is that your laundry? You only have, like, six things in there.\\
85 - Penny: Yeah, I didn’t have any quarters, so I’ve been sneaking stuff into other people’s loads all day. Hey, if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell anybody?\\
86 - Leonard: It doesn’t matter what I say, you’re gonna tell me anyway.\\
87 - Penny: What? That is not true. Bernadette wants a pre-nup.\\
88 - Leonard: Wow. That’s rough.\\
89 - Penny: So you’re saying if I became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn’t sign a pre-nup?\\
90 - Leonard: Absolutely not. If I’m gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you’re on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling, then Leonard gots to get paid. So, you think about us getting married?\\
91 - Penny: I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didn’t leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.\\
92 - Leonard: Joke all you want, but you think about it.\\
93 - Penny: Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations.\\
94 - Leonard: Good luck catching a man with that attitude.\\
95 - Scene: Amy’s laboratory.\\
96 - Sheldon: Boy, oh, boy. This vacation is off to a wonderful start. The smell of formaldehyde, the whir of the centrifuge, the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. Mm, I can already feel my cares just melting away.\\
97 - Amy: I’m excited to work with my boyfriend. It’s gonna be romantic.\\
98 - Sheldon: Way to kill the mood.\\
99 - Amy: Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, that’s the love story Disney should tell.\\
100 - Sheldon: Okay, what do we start with? Maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse’s back? Ha-ha, I’m a freak!\\
101 - Amy: Oh, I’m gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers.\\
102 - Sheldon: Wash those bea… Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella. Yeah, I’d better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?\\
103 - Amy: No, I just need those beakers washed. Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny.\\
104 - Sheldon: What? Excuse me, you have Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab. You’re gonna make him do the dishes? That’s like asking the Incredible Hulk to open a pickle jar.\\
105 - Amy: Sheldon, you’ve never worked in a lab like this before. You have no experience in the field of biology.\\
106 - Sheldon: I have plenty of experience in biology. I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998. And it’s still alive. Let’s do this.\\
107 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
108 - Leonard: Where’s Howard?\\
109 - Raj: No hi, Raj? No how are you, Raj? Just straight to where’s the other white guy?\\
110 - Leonard: I’m sorry. So, listen, I heard something about him. Can you keep it between us?\\
111 - Raj: Ooh, gossip. When I first got here, I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler.\\
112 - Leonard: Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.\\
113 - Raj: Oh, that’s a shame, he’s gonna be devastated.\\
114 - Leonard: I never know what to do in these situations. Should I give him a heads-up?\\
115 - Raj: Hmm. I’m gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelor’s handing out roses. Follow your heart.\\
116 - Howard: Check it out. Look at the size of that Rice Krispie Treat. Same price.\\
117 - Leonard: Hey, Howard, I need to tell you something.\\
118 - Howard: I know, it’s not on my wedding diet. I don’t care.\\
119 - Leonard: Uh, listen, I heard that Bernadette’s thinking about asking you for a pre-nup.\\
120 - Howard: A pre-nup? Wow.\\
121 - Leonard: What are you gonna do?\\
122 - Howard: I don’t know.\\
123 - Raj: Follow your heart.\\
124 - Howard: You know what, it’s not a big deal. She makes more money than me. She wants to protect her financial interests. It’s completely reasonable.\\
125 - Leonard; Good. That’s a healthy attitude.\\
126 - Howard: Yeah, actually, it’s good for both of us. I have assets to protect, too.\\
127 - Raj: Like what?\\
128 - Howard: I’ve got some rare comic books. The Vespa’s almost paid off. And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on Three’s Company.\\
129 - Raj: Mr. Roper’s dead? You can’t just spring that on a guy.\\
130 - Scene: Amy’s laboratory.\\
131 - Sheldon: Here you go. This is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan.\\
132 - Amy: Soap spots. Wash ‘em again.\\
133 - Sheldon: Y-you’re being ridiculous. Those are perfectly clean.\\
134 - Amy: Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. If it’s, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it.\\
135 - Sheldon: Biologists are mean.\\
136 - Later.\\
137 - Amy: All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes.\\
138 - Sheldon: There was something wrong with that detergent. That was way too bubbly.\\
139 - Amy: I’m sure it was.\\
140 - Sheldon: I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter.\\
141 - Amy: Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting.\\
142 - Sheldon: You know what this place needs? A suggestion box.\\
143 - Later.\\
144 - Sheldon: 366… 367…\\
145 - Amy: How’s it going?\\
146 - Sheldon: How’s counting going? When I was in kindergarten, I recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show. I think I got this.\\
147 - Amy: Great.\\
148 - Sheldon: Aw, nuts! One…\\
149 - Later.\\
150 - Sheldon: This is preposterous. I think you’re giving me these tasks because you’re afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do, I’ll show you up.\\
151 - Amy: Really? Is that what you think?\\
152 - Sheldon: Yes, that’s what I think. And I’m super smart, so it’s probably true.\\
153 - Amy: Hey, I’ve been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. You’ve been here for three hours, and you’ve spent one of them in the bathroom.\\
154 - Sheldon: I’m sorry. It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.\\
155 - Amy: Sheldon, I’ve given you the simplest things to do, and you haven’t done one of them right.\\
156 - Sheldon: Maybe that’s because I’m not being challenged. It’s the same reason Einstein failed math.\\
157 - Amy: Maybe the math was too bubbly for him.\\
158 - Sheldon: You think you’re doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And they’d offer to toast it for me, too.\\
159 - Amy: Okay, smart guy. I’m about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. Have at it.\\
160 - Sheldon: All right. I’m no stranger to a little gray matter. Locus coeruleus. Locus coeruleus.\\
161 - Amy: You’re getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. Hope your hands are steady. It’s the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I’m sure it’s no problem for a genius like you.\\
162 - Sheldon: It’s not. I’ll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus, i.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits around the house.\\
163 - Amy: Oh, are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?\\
164 - Sheldon: No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence. Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?\\
165 - Amy: No. But your thumb does.\\
166 - Sheldon: Oh, dear. (Faints)\\
167 - Amy: Yeah, you’re a biologist.\\
168 - Scene: The bar at the Cheesecake Factory.\\
169 - Howard: What are you doing here?\\
170 - Sheldon: I’m on vacation. Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole. Social convention is stupid.\\
171 - Howard: What happened to your thumb?\\
172 - Sheldon: You know, I have ten fingers and ten toes. If I tell you a story about each one of them, we’ll be here all day, let’s just move on.\\
173 - Barman: What can I get you?\\
174 - Sheldon: Ah, seeing as I’m on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. Don’t let me have too many of those.\\
175 - Penny: Hey, what are you guys doing here?\\
176 - Howard: We’re grown men, we drink at bars.\\
177 - Penny: No and no. Everything okay with you and Bernadette?\\
178 - Howard: Oh, yeah, sure.\\
179 - Penny: You and Amy? Good?\\
180 - Sheldon: Oh, better than good.\\
181 - Penny: You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.\\
182 - Howard: I’m not signing a pre-nup.\\
183 - Penny: All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up. You sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a meeting. And you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood.\\
184 - Sheldon: Excuse me, this is a fairly substantial wound. (Removes plaster. Faints again)\\
185 - Scene: Amy’s laboratory.\\
186 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?\\
187 - Amy: What do you want?\\
188 - Sheldon: I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory. After all, I did book the whole week.\\
189 - Amy: Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?\\
190 - Sheldon: I was not myself. I had lost a lot of thumb blood.\\
191 - Amy: That’s not an apology.\\
192 - Sheldon: That is your opinion.\\
193 - Amy: I want a real apology.\\
194 - Sheldon: I’m sorry that you weren’t able to…\\
195 - Amy: No.\\
196 - Sheldon: That my genius…\\
197 - Amy: No.\\
198 - Sheldon: That the soap was…\\
199 - Amy: Sheldon.\\
200 - Sheldon: Fine. Sorry.\\
201 - Amy: You’re forgiven. Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. They’re still dirty from yesterday.\\
202 - Sheldon: Next year I’m going to Epcot.\\
203 - Scene: Bernadette’s car.\\
204 - Bernadette: Are you mad at me?\\
205 - Howard: No. I’m not mad at you. I just wish you would have come to me, so I didn’t have to hear it through the nerd-vine.\\
206 - Bernadette: So, what are we gonna do?\\
207 - Howard: You really want me to sign a pre-nup?\\
208 - Bernadette: I don’t know. My dad’s pretty insistent on it, though.\\
209 - Howard: Why don’t I talk to your dad, man-to-man?\\
210 - Bernadette: Really? Oh, that’d be so great.\\
211 - Howard: Done.\\
212 - Bernadette: I should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things. Even though he’s retired from the police force, he still carries his gun. But don’t worry, he won’t shoot it. It’s more of a fashion statement.\\
213 - Howard: Okay.\\
214 - Bernadette: And just to be safe, when you talk to him, don’t bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals, Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that you’re Jewish.\\
215 - Howard: Got it, got it. Will you e-mail me that list?\\
216 - Bernadette: So the thing to watch for, if he’s shouting at you, you’re okay, but if he starts to get real quiet, leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact. Not in a straight line, throw some zigs and zigs in there.\\
217 - Howard: You know, this isn’t that pressing. Why don’t I talk to him about it in May.\\
218 - Bernadette: In May you’re gonna be on the International Space Station.\\
219 - Howard: They’ve got a phone.
\subsection {Episode 17: The Rothman Disintegration}
1 - Scene: A corridor at the university\\
2 - Raj: It was a nice retirement party.\\
3 - Howard: I guess. Still, it’s a shame Professor Rothman was forced to step down.\\
4 - Leonard: What choice did the university have? He snapped. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.\\
5 - Howard: I wonder how long Sheldon’s got.\\
6 - Sheldon: These shrimp are all the same size. There’s no the logical order to eat them in.\\
7 - Leonard: Can’t be very long.\\
8 - Raj: Hey, look, there’s Rothman’s empty office. Sad.\\
9 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
10 - Sheldon: Mm, indeed.\\
11 - Howard: So sad.\\
12 - Sheldon: Dibs.\\
13 - Kripke: What’s up, fewwas?\\
14 - Sheldon: What are you doing here, Kripke?\\
15 - Kripke: Ah, measuwing my new office for dwapes.\\
16 - Sheldon: This is not your office. It hasn’t been assigned yet.\\
17 - Kripke: Well, I called dibs at the Chwistmas party when Pwofessor Wothman twied to have intercourse with the toys for tots cowwection box.\\
18 - Sheldon: Dibs? This is a university, not a playground. Offices are not assigned because someone called dibs.\\
19 - Leonard: You just called dibs.\\
20 - Sheldon: Shut it. Offices are assigned by seniority. I arrived at the university first.\\
21 - Kripke: I awwived at the office first. I’m the pwoverbial earwy bird.\\
22 - Rothman (entering, naked): Gentlemen.\\
23 - All: Professor Rothman.\\
24 - Rothman: Good evening.\\
25 - All: Good evening.\\
26 - Raj: I’m glad that men are wearing hats again. They’re so distinguished.\\
27 - Credits sequence.\\
28 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
29 - Amy: I got you a little something.\\
30 - Penny: A little something? Oh, it… what, this is huge.\\
31 - Amy: What’s huge is what you’ve done for me.\\
32 - Penny: Oh, no, Amy, I haven’t done anything.\\
33 - Amy: No, no, before I met you, I was a mousy wallflower. But look at me now. I’m like some kind of downtown hipster party girl. With a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things. Open it. Open it.\\
34 - Penny: Okay. (Opens parcel to find a huge and not at all flattering painting of Penny and Amy)\\
35 - Amy: I wanted to get you something you didn’t have.\\
36 - Penny: Wow. I-I don’t know what to s… Wow.\\
37 - Amy: Do you like it?\\
38 - Penny: Do I like it? Wow.\\
39 - Amy: So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?\\
40 - Penny: Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow. Um, you know, I’d have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer and…\\
41 - Amy: No problem.\\
42 - Penny: Oh, look. You, huh, you just, you got it all right there. Wow.\\
43 - Scene: A bathroom at the university.\\
44 - Sheldon: I found him. He’s in the bathroom. President Siebert?\\
45 - Siebert: Can’t this wait?\\
46 - Sheldon: I’m sorry. We just need a word.\\
47 - Siebert: Now? You realize I’m your boss, and I am holding my pen1s?\\
48 - Kripke: Sheldon, give the man some pwivacy. I’m sowwy. This guy’s got no wespect for boundawies.\\
49 - Siebert: What do you want?\\
50 - Kripke: Will you tell this wunatic that Pwofessor Wothman’s office is wightfully mine?\\
51 - Siebert: Can’t you take this up with your department chairman?\\
52 - Sheldon: We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical. Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.\\
53 - Siebert: Gentlemen, there’s a task I’m trying to accomplish here, and I’m having trouble doing it.\\
54 - Sheldon: Oh, my. President Siebert, I don’t mean to be an alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. If you’re interested, I can send you a link to a YouTube video that’ll show you how to perform your own rectal exam. Yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim your nails first.\\
55 - Kripke: Ignore him, Pwesident Siebert. I’m sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectwy healthy pwostate.\\
56 - Sheldon: Oh, he’s just trying to butter you up. And for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam.\\
57 - Siebert: Gentlemen, I’m going to allow the two of you to work this out because A, you’re both brilliant scientists, and B, as far as who gets Rothman’s office, I couldn’t give the furry crack of a rat’s behind.\\
58 - Kripke: Well, as wong as we’re here, I might as well take a weak.\\
59 - Sheldon: Kripke?\\
60 - Kripke: Yes?\\
61 - Sheldon: You’re in my spot.\\
62 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
63 - Bernadette: That is big.\\
64 - Penny: So big.\\
65 - Bernadette: And ugly.\\
66 - Penny: So ugly. What am I gonna do?\\
67 - Bernadette: I don’t know. You can’t take it down. You’ll break her heart. Look at that face. That enormous, unsettling, crazy face.\\
68 - Penny: Is there any chance I’ll learn to love it?\\
69 - Bernadette: That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?\\
70 - Penny: All right, it’s got to go.\\
71 - Bernadette: What will you tell Amy?\\
72 - Penny: How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you’re not in it?\\
73 - Bernadette: Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one? I already have a picture of me and Howard’s mom getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach. I’ve suffered enough.\\
74 - Penny: Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it’s kind of heavy.\\
75 - Bernadette: Mmm, too bad you’re not as strong as the dude in the painting.\\
76 - Scene: The apartment.\\
77 - Raj: Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a stick. He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick.\\
78 - Howard: It’s numbered.\\
79 - Raj: Ooh, limited edition. Nice.\\
80 - Sheldon (knock on door): Oh, that’ll be Kripke.\\
81 - Leonard: What’s he doing here?\\
82 - Sheldon: We’re going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. And if that doesn’t work, I’m going to poison his tea.\\
83 - Kripke: Cooper.\\
84 - Sheldon: Kripke. Come in. I’m making tea. Would you like a cup?\\
85 - Kripke: Am I weawing a summer fwock? No, I don’t want tea. Wet’s get down to bwass tacks.\\
86 - Sheldon: Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship…\\
87 - Kripke: We’re not fwiends.\\
88 - Sheldon: Well, that’s a little hard to hear, but all right. As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in mind, I propose the following. I will take Rothman’s office, and you will find a way to be okay with that.\\
89 - Kripke: How about I take Wothman’s office, and you go suck a wemon?\\
90 - Sheldon: You sure I can’t get you that cup of tea?\\
91 - Raj: How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?\\
92 - Kripke: What the fwig is that?\\
93 - Sheldon: Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. All hail Sam Kass.\\
94 - All: Hail.\\
95 - Kripke: How does it work?\\
96 - Sheldon: Oh, it’s very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.\\
97 - Kripke: I’m sowwy. Can you wepeat that?\\
98 - Sheldon: Well, of course. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.\\
99 - Kripke: Almost got it. One more time.\\
100 - Sheldon: Surely. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock…\\
101 - Howard: Sheldon, stop. He’s screwing with you.\\
102 - Sheldon: Is he? Well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. I’d smack you with a glove, but just last week I packed away my winter things.\\
103 - Howard: It’s the 21st century. You can’t have a duel.\\
104 - Leonard: H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?\\
105 - Sheldon: Not pistols. Minds. A trivia contest, and you may choose the field of battle. Star Trek trivia, Star Trek: Next Generation trivia, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine trivia, Star Trek: Voyager trivia, or model trains.\\
106 - Kripke: You have a compwete advantage in twivia. You have an eidetic memowy. Pwus, I haven’t watched Star Twek since I discovered the stwip cwub near my apartment has a fwee buffet.\\
107 - Leonard: It’s gonna be hard to find something you’re both equally good at.\\
108 - Raj: Is there anything you’re both equally bad at?\\
109 - Both: Sports.\\
110 - Scene: A basketball court.\\
111 - Leonard: All right, this is one-on-one. First person to five wins the office. Any questions? Yes, Sheldon?\\
112 - Sheldon: Five what?\\
113 - Leonard: Balls in the basket. (Throws ball to Sheldon)\\
114 - Sheldon (dodging out of the way): Ew!\\
115 - Later. Sheldon dribbling ball, approached Kripke, throws it wildly at a pile of mats in the corner.\\
116 - Kripke: It’s out, wight?\\
117 - Later. Kripke, dribbling ball, watched by Sheldon, dribbles it all the way into the back wall.\\
118 - Kripke: Time. Wan out of woom.\\
119 - Leonard: You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?\\
120 - Raj: Yeah.\\
121 - Leonard: I get it.\\
122 - Later. Kripke chases ball across room chased by Sheldon. Sounds of collision. Sheldon chases ball back across the room chased by Kripke.\\
123 - Later. Ball hits Sheldon in back of head.\\
124 - Sheldon: Hey! He did that on purpose,\\
125 - Leonard: No, he didn’t. Nothing that’s happening here is being done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Let’s try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office.\\
126 - Kripke: Making it too easy there, Hofstadter.\\
127 - Leonard: No. No, I’m not.\\
128 - Sheldon: Use the force, Sheldon. Use the force. (Throws ball. It goes about two feet in front of him.) I’m gonna need more force.\\
129 - Kripke: Aw wight, Cooper, pwepare to have your heart bwoken. (Throws ball up. It hits the ceiling and doesn’t come down.) Do I get points for that?\\
130 - Later. A trampoline has been added. Sheldon tries first, ball hits backboard, bounces back in his face. Kripke tries next, with a run up, ends up crashing into the back wall again.\\
131 - Later.\\
132 - Leonard: All right, we gave it 45 minutes. It’s no longer funny. Let’s try something else.\\
133 - Sheldon: What do you propose?\\
134 - Leonard: Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office.\\
135 - Kripke: Oh, you are going down, Cooper.\\
136 - Sheldon: I don’t think so, Kripke. I’ve bounced many a rubber ball in my day.\\
137 - Leonard: All right, that’s enough trash talk. One, two, three.\\
138 - Howard: Sheldon was higher.\\
139 - Leonard: Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office.\\
140 - Sheldon: Who’s unsatisfactory in P.E. now?\\
141 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
142 - Amy: Oh, what a great movie.\\
143 - Penny: I cannot believe you’ve never seen Grease.\\
144 - Amy: My mother didn’t allow me to watch it. She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.\\
145 - Bernadette: I’ve got to go. I’ve got to get up early. My company’s testing a new steroid that supposedly doesn’t shrink testicles, and the last one there has to do the measuring.\\
146 - Amy: I guess I should get going, too. Good night, painting Penny. Good night, real Penny.\\
147 - Penny: Good night, real Amy.\\
148 - Amy: You don’t have to say good night to painting Amy, ’cause she’s never leaving.\\
149 - Bernadette: Good night, real Penny.\\
150 - Penny: Bye.\\
151 - Bernadette: Good night, transvestite Penny.\\
152 - Penny: Ah, okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out of sight, out of mind. I wish.\\
153 - Amy (entering): You know, can I borrow that movie? Those singing hooligans really got my motor running.\\
154 - Penny: Sure, sure. Enjoy. I mean, get it back to me when you can, or, you know what, actually, you keep it. It’s just going to be my gift to you. Bye.\\
155 - Amy: Thank you. Wait. Where’d the painting go?\\
156 - Penny: It’s right over there.\\
157 - Amy: Why?\\
158 - Penny: I have no idea. That is weird.\\
159 - Amy: You hate it.\\
160 - Penny: No. No, no. It’s just, it’s a little big.\\
161 - Amy: I feel like an idiot.\\
162 - Penny: No, come on, you’re not an idiot. Look, just help me put it back up.\\
163 - Amy: Why? So you can just take it down when I leave? I don’t need your pity.\\
164 - Penny: Oh, Amy, come on.\\
165 - Amy: I’m just glad I didn’t go for the sculpture.\\
166 - Scene: Rothman’s office.\\
167 - Sheldon: Ah, the spoils. I see why victors love them.\\
168 - Raj: I’m happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit I’m going to miss sharing an office with you.\\
169 - Sheldon: Oh, of course you are. Feel free to drop by any time.\\
170 - Raj: Thank you.\\
171 - Sheldon: Yeah. Call first. (Pushes him out. Closes door. Rothman is standing naked behind it.)\\
172 - Rothman: Oh. Hello.\\
173 - Sheldon: Professor Rothman. This isn’t your office any more. You’re retired.\\
174 - Rothman: I think the word you’re looking for is invisible.\\
175 - Scene: Amy’s apartment.\\
176 - Penny: I came to say I’m sorry.\\
177 - Amy: Don’t bother.\\
178 - Penny: Oh, Amy, please.\\
179 - Amy: I’m so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting.\\
180 - Penny: I know.\\
181 - Amy: I was a fool from Summer Lovin’ to the very last rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong.\\
182 - Penny: You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.\\
183 - Amy: Yes, too much. Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. I clearly like you more than you like me.\\
184 - Penny: I don’t think you can put a number on how much one person likes another.\\
185 - Amy: I bought you a painting that’s 12 square feet in area. There’s a number.\\
186 - Penny: Amy, come on…\\
187 - Amy: If you don’t like feet, you can try dollars. The painting set me back three grand.\\
188 - Penny: Three gr… Oh, my God! Look, look, Amy, all you need to know is, you are my friend and I don’t want to lose you out of my life.\\
189 - Amy: I’m sorry, I’m just having trouble believing you right now.\\
190 - Penny: Grab your hammer.\\
191 - Amy: No. Damage is done.\\
192 - Penny: Okay, look, I didn’t want to say this, but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous.\\
193 - Amy: Oh, my goodness, how could I have not seen that? The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool.\\
194 - Penny: Yeah, th-th-th-that’s what it is, so…\\
195 - Amy: You have such a good heart.\\
196 - Penny: Huh, I try.\\
197 - Amy: Come on.\\
198 - Penny: Well where are we going?\\
199 - Amy: We’re going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.\\
200 - Penny: Well, what about Bernadette?\\
201 - Amy: Oh, screw her. She’s just lucky we let her hang out with us.\\
202 - Scene: Rothman’s office. Sheldon is trying to affix paper over a fiercely blowing air vent.\\
203 - Leonard: What are you doing?\\
204 - Sheldon: I’m trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.\\
205 - Howard: Why don’t you just turn up the thermostat?\\
206 - Sheldon: Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my new office isn’t in my new office. No. It’s next door, in Professor Davenport’s office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause.\\
207 - Leonard: Why is there a hole here?\\
208 - Sheldon: Why is there a hole in my new office? I’ve narrowed it down to two possibilities: There was something in the wall that someone outside the wall wanted, or the more disturbing, there was something in the wall that wanted out.\\
209 - Raj: Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. That’s nice.\\
210 - Sheldon: Is it? Listen.\\
211 - Raj: What, you don’t like wind chimes?\\
212 - Sheldon: No, I hate them, but it gets worse. There it is.\\
213 - Howard: The bird?\\
214 - Sheldon: Yeah, It’s completely out of tune with the wind chimes.\\
215 - Raj: So?\\
216 - Sheldon: You don’t get it, do you? That’s a mockingbird. Mockingbirds can change their song, which means he’s out of tune on purpose. He’s mocking me. Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?\\
217 - Howard: The growing realization that you are one wacky b*st*rd? Yep.\\
218 - Sheldon: No. The vibration. We are directly underneath the geology lab, and they’re running their confounded sieve shakers again. Hey, gravel monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!\\
219 - Leonard: Sheldon, relax.\\
220 - Sheldon: How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.\\
221 - Leonard: If you’re not happy, why don’t you just let Kripke have the office?\\
222 - Sheldon: What, and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We’re trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys! (To the bird) And you, the notes are C, D, E, G and A. You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!\\
223 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
224 - Penny: How’s that?\\
225 - Amy: Little higher on the right.\\
226 - Penny: Now?\\
227 - Amy: Little more. No. That’s got it.\\
228 - Penny: Yeah, okay. That’s, uh, that’s good.\\
229 - Amy: I’ll let you in on a little secret.\\
230 - Penny: Mm.\\
231 - Amy: Originally we were painted nude. But I had him add clothes, ’cause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality.\\
232 - Penny: Yeah, good call.\\
233 - Amy: But if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges.\\
234 - Penny: You’re talking about the painting, right?\\
235 - Amy: Sure.\\
236 - Scene: Rothman’s office. Sheldon has his head stuck in the hole in the wall.\\
237 - Sheldon: Help! Somebody help!\\
238 - Leonard: What happened?\\
239 - Sheldon: I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.\\
240 - Leonard: Why would you do that?\\
241 - Sheldon: It’s called scientific curiosity. Now go get butter.\\
242 - Leonard: Hang in there. I’ll be right back. (Takes out phone and takes a photo. Sits down and starts posting it online.)
\subsection {Episode 18: The Werewolf Transformation}
1 - Scene: A barber’s shop.\\
2 - Leonard: I’m just gonna run to the store and get a few things. I’ll pick you up when you’re done.\\
3 - Sheldon: Okay. I like it a little better when you stay, but all right.\\
4 - Barber: Hey, Sheldon.\\
5 - Sheldon: Hello. I’m here for my haircut with Mr. D’Onofrio.\\
6 - Barber: I’m sorry, Uncle Tony’s in the hospital. He’s pretty sick.\\
7 - Sheldon: Oh, dear, Mr. D’Onofrio’s in the hospital. Why do these things always happen to me?\\
8 - Barber: I can cut it for you.\\
9 - Sheldon: You’re not Mr. D’Onofrio. I get my hair cut by Mr. D’Onofrio. You believe this guy?\\
10 - Leonard: Excuse us for a second. Sheldon, it’s okay, he can do it. He’s a barber.\\
11 - Sheldon: He’s not a barber, he’s the nephew. He’s an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. Besides, Mr. D’Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas.\\
12 - Leonard: What are you talking about?\\
13 - Sheldon: When I first moved here I was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr. D’Onofrio.\\
14 - Leonard: There’s no such thing as haircut records.\\
15 - Sheldon: Yes, there are.\\
16 - Leonard: Have you ever seen them?\\
17 - Sheldon: No, but my mother assured me they were sent here, and I’ll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesn’t have them. Uh, excuse me. Do you have access to my haircut records?\\
18 - Barber: Your what?\\
19 - Sheldon: To paraphrase T.S. Eliot, this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with a nephew.\\
20 - Leonard: Sheldon, you’re a grown man, he’s a professional, and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. Just sit down and let him do it.\\
21 - Sheldon: Fine, but if I come out of this looking like a dork, it’s on you. (Sits)\\
22 - Barber: So my kid said the funniest thing today.\\
23 - Sheldon: Nope. (Runs out)\\
24 - Leonard: When you tell this story later, the word we usually use is quirky.\\
25 - Credits sequence.\\
26 - Scene: The apartment.\\
27 - Sheldon: Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?\\
28 - Leonard: Sure. What are you doing?\\
29 - Sheldon: I’m trying to get the hair out of my eyes.\\
30 - Leonard: Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut.\\
31 - Sheldon: Thank you for captioning my nightmare.\\
32 - Howard: Lookie here, I got my travel orders.\\
33 - Raj: Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, for astronaut training Monday eight a.m.\\
34 - Howard: Yeah, but it’s from NASA, so it’s oh eight hundred.\\
35 - Raj: But it says eight a.m.\\
36 - Howard: You read it as oh eight hundred.\\
37 - Raj: It doesn’t have an oh in front of it.\\
38 - Howard: You know what does have an oh in front of it? Oh, my God, I’m an astronaut, and you’re dying of jealousy.\\
39 - Leonard: So, what kind of things are they… (to Sheldon) will you stop that?\\
40 - Sheldon: I can’t help it, I feel like a teen heartthrob.\\
41 - Penny: You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother’s hair. I could do it for you.\\
42 - Sheldon: Penny, I know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, here in town we don’t churn our own butter, we don’t, uh, make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootin’ don’t get our hair cut by bottle-blonde…\\
43 - Leonard: Sheldon, be nice.\\
44 - Sheldon: I’m sorry, it’s the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair.\\
45 - Raj: You could go to my guy. He’s at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills. They bring you a cup of tea, they’ll massage your scalp. It’s about two hundred dollars, but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like Tony Danza.\\
46 - Howard: Quick question here, have we actually changed the conversation from I’m going\\
47 - to astronaut training to Sheldon can’t get a haircut?\\
48 - Raj: Now who’s dying of jealousy? Oh, it’s you.\\
49 - Scene: Amy’s apartment. Amy is playing her harp.\\
50 - Amy: I’m a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I’m wanted… I’m wanted… wanted, dead or alive. Sheldon, you’re ruining girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night.\\
51 - Sheldon: I’m sorry. I’m looking for a barber and I’m running out of time. My hair is growing at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond. I mean, if you’re quiet, you can hear it.\\
52 - Amy: What about Supercuts?\\
53 - Sheldon: I tried once. They do men’s and women’s hair in the same room at the same time. It’s like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.\\
54 - Amy: Well, this isn’t a crisis. Why don’t you just let your hair grow out a little?\\
55 - Sheldon: Why don’t I let my hair grow out? Um, why don’t I start wearing Birkenstocks and, uh, uh, seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it?\\
56 - Amy: Well, I don’t know. I think you might look sexy with long hair. The kind that flows down to your shoulders and blows back while riding on a horse, bareback and bare-chested. I’m gonna go brush my teeth, it might take a while.\\
57 - Scene: Bernadette’s bedroom.\\
58 - Howard (on Skype): Hi.\\
59 - Bernadette: Hi, sweetie.\\
60 - Howard: I miss you.\\
61 - Bernadette: I miss you, too. So tell me all about your first day.\\
62 - Howard: Oh, wow, where do I even start? I got to experience zero gravity.\\
63 - Bernadette: Cool. How do they do that?\\
64 - Howard: It’s pretty neat. You get in this plane that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds, and then straight back down like it’s going to crash, and they do it over and over again, you know, no matter how many times you throw up.\\
65 - Bernadette: You threw up?\\
66 - Howard: Yeah, and the craziest part is, because there’s no gravity, the throw-up kind of floats there, in a little ball, and if your mouth is open because you’re screaming, sometimes it just floats right back in. Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens.\\
67 - Bernadette: That sounds mean.\\
68 - Howard: No. Yeah, I would have laughed, too, but I didn’t want the vomit to come back out. Anyway, oh, could you do me a favour and overnight me some more underwear?\\
69 - Bernadette: Sure, why?\\
70 - Howard: I got a look at the centrifuge they’re going to spin me around in tomorrow, and I have a hunch I packed a little light.\\
71 - Scene: A hospital ward.\\
72 - Sheldon: Mr. D’Onofrio? It’s Sheldon. They didn’t have anything barber-themed in the gift shop, so I got you this. I don’t know if you can read his little T-shirt. It says, um, get well bear-y soon. Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now, you’d be laughing. Anyway, there’s new studies that show, people in comas are aware of everything going on around them. With that in mind, if you can hear me, move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors.\\
73 - Nurse: Can I help you?\\
74 - Sheldon: Yes. Do you have something I could use as a cape?\\
75 - Nurse: Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills, slip out of the ninth floor, and go on a little adventure?\\
76 - Sheldon: Oh, no, no, I’m just here to get my hair cut.\\
77 - Nurse: I-I see. J-Jus-Just wait here one moment. Security!\\
78 - Sheldon: I got to run. But not with scissors, that would be unsafe.\\
79 - Scene: The apartment.\\
80 - Penny: So, if I move my horsey here, isn’t that checkmate and I win?\\
81 - Leonard: Hmm.\\
82 - Penny: Well, is it or isn’t it?\\
83 - Leonard: You know, I think this is a good stopping point. Uh, it’s your first real game. I threw a lot of information at you.\\
84 - Penny: Well, no, I mean, your king is trapped. He can’t go here because of my lighthouse, and he can’t go here because of my pointy-head guy.\\
85 - Leonard: Like I said, complicated game.\\
86 - Penny: So did I win or not?\\
87 - Leonard: Did you have fun? Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. Now that’s, that-that’s what chess is all about.\\
88 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
89 - Leonard: Hey.\\
90 - Penny: Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I’ll move.\\
91 - Sheldon: Eh, why? My spot, your spot, what difference does it make?\\
92 - Penny: Okay, what just happened?\\
93 - Leonard: I don’t know. Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot, I’m guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug, and changed the course of human events.\\
94 - Penny: Uh, sweetie, are you all right?\\
95 - Sheldon: No, I’m not all right. It’s been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened.\\
96 - Penny: Okay, I’m sorry, I don’t understand.\\
97 - Sheldon: Leonard, explain it to her.\\
98 - Leonard: Oh, uh, he’s crazy.\\
99 - Sheldon: I have spent my whole life trying to bring order to the universe by carefully planning every moment of every day. But all my efforts, our dinner schedule, my pyjama rotation, my bowel movement spreadsheet, it’s clear now, I’ve been wasting my time.\\
100 - Leonard: Good. I’m taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.\\
101 - Penny: You know, Sh-Sheldon, sometimes it’s nice not knowing what’s coming. I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out, we broke up, now we’re trying again. We don’t know what’s gonna happen.\\
102 - Sheldon: Oh, please, everyone knows what’s going to happen. But I see your point.\\
103 - Leonard: I think this could be good for you. Maybe it’s time for you to shake things up a bit.\\
104 - Sheldon: You’re right. I should embrace the chaos.\\
105 - Leonard: Great. What are you going to do first?\\
106 - Sheldon: I don’t know. I could do anything. All bets are off. The world is my oyster. I got it. I’m going to put on my Tuesday pyjamas tonight.\\
107 - Leonard: I got to tell you, I’m a little worried about him.\\
108 - Penny: If I were you, I’d be worried that a girl who’s never played chess in her life just kicked your ass.\\
109 - Scene: Bernadette’s bedroom.\\
110 - Howard (on Skype): Hi.\\
111 - Bernadette: Howie, what happened to you?\\
112 - Howard: We did overnight survival training in the wilderness. Big fun. Big, big fun. I was gonna freshen up for you but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom.\\
113 - Bernadette: Survival training? Is that like camping?\\
114 - Howard: Uh-huh. Except you don’t have food or water, and they don’t have a sunset Sabbath service like they do at Camp Hess-Kramer.\\
115 - Bernadette: Do you sleep in tents?\\
116 - Howard: No. I slept in a hole I dug in the ground with my bare hands. And at some point during the night, an armadillo crawled in and spooned me.\\
117 - Bernadette: Poor baby.\\
118 - Howard: But I did it. I survived. I wasn’t sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit. I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death. But somehow as I sat there, wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat, I found that primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living, no matter what the cost.\\
119 - Bernadette: You’re so brave. I’m proud of you.\\
120 - Howard: I ate a butterfly. It was so small and beautiful, but I was so hungry.\\
121 - Bernadette: Are you crying?\\
122 - Howard: No, I don’t think it’s possible. I’m severely dehydrated. My pee is like toothpaste.\\
123 - Bernadette: Howie, if you’re not able to do this, come home. It won’t change how I feel about you.\\
124 - Howard: Thanks, honey, but I can’t quit. If I do, I’ll just be a guy who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up.\\
125 - Bernadette: Well, is there anything I could do to help?\\
126 - Howard: No. Wait. Send more underwear.\\
127 - Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Leonard wakes to the sound of bongos.\\
128 - Leonard (going to living room): Don’t let this be Sheldon playing bongos. Please don’t let this be Sheldon playing bongos.\\
129 - Sheldon: Hello, Leonard, do you like my bongos? Bet you didn’t know that I had bongos.\\
130 - Leonard: Sheldon, it’s three o’clock in the morning.\\
131 - Sheldon: Three in the morning is a good time for bongos.\\
132 - Leonard: I was sleeping.\\
133 - Sheldon: Leonard sleeps while I play bongos.\\
134 - Leonard: No, he doesn’t.\\
135 - Sheldon: Leonard no sleep while I play bongos. Bongo solo.\\
136 - Leonard: Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop it!\\
137 - Penny (entering): What the hell?!\\
138 - Leonard: Oh, hi, Penny, guess what? Sheldon got bongos.\\
139 - Penny: Why did you get bongos?\\
140 - Sheldon: Richard Feynman played the bongos. I thought I’d give that a try.\\
141 - Leonard: Richard Feynman was a famous physicist.\\
142 - Penny: Oh, Leonard, it’s three o’clock in the morning. I don’t care if Richard Feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt.\\
143 - Sheldon: Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun. Penny forgot to use the subjunctive.\\
144 - Leonard: Sheldon, go to bed. You have work in the morning.\\
145 - Sheldon: Maybe, maybe not. Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world.\\
146 - Leonard: W-w-wuh, no, no, hang on,uh, uh, roommate agreement. No hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after ten p.m.\\
147 - Sheldon: Roommate agreement? Are you kidding? We are living in a world of chaos. Roommate agreement.\\
148 - Penny: Where are you going?\\
149 - Sheldon: Wherever the music takes me, kitten. I play bongos walking down the stairs. (Sound of falling) Oh! Oh! Never play bongos walking down the stairs.\\
150 - Scene: Howard’s hotel room. There is a knock on the door.\\
151 - Bernadette: Surprise.\\
152 - Howard: What are you doing here?\\
153 - Bernadette: I’m here to help you get through this. You can’t do it on your own, you need someone to take care of you.\\
154 - Howard: Oh, I love you so much.\\
155 - Bernadette: Oh, I love you.\\
156 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, your bath is getting cold!\\
157 - Howard: Don’t worry, once she falls asleep, I’ll spoon you like an armadillo.\\
158 - Scene: Amy’s apartment.\\
159 - Amy: He showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos. I foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call.\\
160 - Leonard: Poor guy. He must have been exhausted. Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!\\
161 - Amy: That was kind of uncalled for.\\
162 - Leonard: No, it was called for.\\
163 - Sheldon: What’s going on?\\
164 - Penny: All right, Sheldon, this craziness has gone on long enough. Please come home so I can cut your hair.\\
165 - Sheldon: Penny, you’re not trained. You’re not licensed. Most importantly, you don’t have access to my haircut records.\\
166 - Penny: All right, honey, look, we’ve known each other for a long time now, right? I’ve taken you to Disneyland, I kicked a bully in the nuts for you, I sing you Soft Kitty when you’re sick, you’ve even saw me naked once.\\
167 - Leonard: I’m sorry, duh, what?\\
168 - Penny: It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what I’m doing. Please let me cut your hair.\\
169 - Sheldon: Amy, what do you think?\\
170 - Amy: There’s not a hair on my body I wouldn’t let this woman trim.\\
171 - Sheldon: Fine, let’s go. Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch.\\
172 - Amy: There’s only so many times a woman can say how about the bed?\\
173 - Leonard: What’s this about Sheldon seeing you naked?\\
174 - Sheldon: Oh, relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts.\\
175 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. Penny is cutting Sheldon’s hair.\\
176 - Penny: Almost done.\\
177 - Sheldon: At the end of the haircut, Mr. D’Onofrio would tell me a dirty joke.\\
178 - Penny: Well, sorry, I don’t know any dirty jokes.\\
179 - Sheldon: That’s okay, I never understood them anyway.\\
180 - Penny: Okay, what do you think?\\
181 - Sheldon: Hmm, well, it’s a little Hollywood. But I think I can pull it off. Well done, Penny.\\
182 - Penny: Ha, told you. Okay, I’m just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go.\\
183 - Sheldon: Fun time. Hah. Sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me.\\
184 - Penny: Okay. (Sheldon laughs and jerks, Penny accidentally shaves a strip up the back of his head) Okay, yep, we’re all done now. It’s just, it’s good. Let me just take that away from you. Okay.\\
185 - Sgeldon: Thank you very much.\\
186 - Penny: You are welcome. Yeah, I’m gonna have to move.
\subsection {Episode 19: The Weekend Vortex}
1 - Scene: The stairwell\\
2 - Raj: Hey, want to spend some time playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?\\
3 - Leonard: Oh, I don’t know. I kind of promised myself I’d get off the computer, be more physically active. Get some exercise.\\
4 - Howard: You’re about to walk up three flights of stairs.\\
5 - Leonard: Good point, I’m in.\\
6 - Raj: You know what would be great? Let’s do it like the old days.\\
7 - Leonard: You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?\\
8 - Raj: Yeah. Start Saturday morning, go 48 hours, sleeping bags, junk food.\\
9 - Howard: Turn off our phones so our moms can’t call.\\
10 - Leonard: It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us.\\
11 - Howard: They called the cops because of the smell. They thought we were dead.\\
12 - Raj: We were badass back in the day.\\
13 - Leonard: All right, let’s do it.\\
14 - Howard: 48 hours of Star Wars gaming.\\
15 - Raj: It’s on like Alderaan.\\
16 - Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend. Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars< marathon\\
17 - Raj: Woo-hoo!\\
18 - Sheldon: Movies or video games? Or board game? Or trading card games? Or Lego’s? Or dress up? Or comic books? Or dramatic readings of novelizations? Yes to all!\\
19 - Leonard: We are going to play the online game.\\
20 - Sheldon: The online game? Bully!\\
21 - Amy: Gentlemen, as much as I’m sure Sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and I have other plans. We are attending my Aunt Flora’s 93rd birthday party.\\
22 - Sheldon: Just tell her I can’t come.\\
23 - Amy: She’ll be disappointed if we don’t show up.\\
24 - Sheldon: She’s 93. She won’t be disappointed for very long.\\
25 - Amy: No, hang on. I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. I made a written record request 72 hours in advance. I checked the tyre pressure on the car. I even contacted the Centres For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County. FYI, it’s none.\\
26 - Sheldon: Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way.\\
27 - Amy: You use it to get your way.\\
28 - Sheldon: I use it to get the right way. The fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence.\\
29 - Amy: You gave me your word. You’re coming with me.\\
30 - Leonard: We’ll miss you, Sheldon.\\
31 - Sheldon: Yeah, well, who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters. That’s for babies.\\
32 - Howard: Yeah, but it’s got lightsabres.\\
33 - Sheldon: Yeah, please, Amy! It’s got lightsabres!\\
34 - Credits sequence.\\
35 - Scene: The comic book store.\\
36 - Sheldon: Hello Stuart.\\
37 - Stuart: Hey Sheldon. Help you with anything?\\
38 - Sheldon: Yes. I’m attending a party this weekend, for a 93-year-old woman. Can you recommend a gift?\\
39 - Stuart: Uh, I don’t know. Could put a tennis ball on the end of Excalibur. Make a pretty badass cane.\\
40 - Sheldon: Do you supply the the tennis ball?\\
41 - Stuart: No.\\
42 - Sheldon: Then no. What else?\\
43 - Stuart: Hmm. Oh, have this collectors edition Batman utility belt. Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy.\\
44 - Sheldon: Well, she’d just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume.\\
45 - Stuart: I’m sorry Sheldon, that’s it. That’s all I got.\\
46 - Sheldon: Oh, it’s not your fault. I’ve been to the model train store. I’ve been to Radio Shack. This woman is impossible to shop for.\\
47 - Leonard: I’d make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasn’t in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.\\
48 - Sheldon: No, Leonard, go ahead and mock. Like my daddy always said, Shelly, women aren’t anything but flippin’ pains in the bottom.\\
49 - Leonard: That’s what your father used to say?\\
50 - Sheldon: Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw, but you get the gist.\\
51 - Howard: Look, if you don’t want to go to the party, just don’t go. You’re a grown man. Act like one. Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. Maybe she’ll dig it. Women like a firm hand on the tiller.\\
52 - Raj: I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didn’t help.\\
53 - Sheldon: Yeah, I always thought if I were ever enslaved, it would be by an advanced species from another planet, not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale.\\
54 - Howard: Now, I downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation. (Phone makes whip sound)\\
55 - Sheldon: You’re right. I’m smart as a whip. I should be able to figure this out.\\
56 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
57 - Leonard: Hey, listen, I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered, because we’re in this relationship-beta-test, if I should have asked you first. Then I thought if I did check with you first, you’d think that I was taking things to seriously. And then, then I got a nosebleed.\\
58 - Penny: You don’t have to check with me. Do whatever you want.\\
59 - Leonard: Oh. I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay.\\
60 - Penny: Really, what were you hoping for?\\
61 - Leonard: I don’t know, maybe that you’d be a little upset, and then you’d realize that I’m a stallion that has to run free. And that would turn you on a little.\\
62 - Penny: Okay, I’m an actress. Ask me again.\\
63 - Leonard: Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?\\
64 - Penny: Whu… the entire weekend? You mean I wouldn’t see you at all? But I ju… No, no, I knew what I was getting into. You can’t put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter. Oh, my, is it getting hot in here? Ay, papi.\\
65 - Leonard: Ay papi? What is that?\\
66 - Penny: An acting choice.\\
67 - Leonard: Oh. So you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?\\
68 - Penny: Choo got a problem with that, papi?\\
69 - Leonard: Uh-uh.\\
70 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Penny!\\
71 - Penny: Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here.\\
72 - Sheldon: Hello, Penny. I just stopped by to bring you this gift.\\
73 - Penny: Gummy bears? Thank you.\\
74 - Sheldon: Now that you’re in my debt, please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt’s tedious birthday party.\\
75 - Penny: Not a chance.\\
76 - Sheldon: All right. I thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. These are Cooper Coupons. These are for various things I can do for you. Um, oh, this one is for one free grammar check. Uh, you could use it for emails, letters, tattoos, what have you. Um, oh, this is fun one. This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center, where I point out their mistakes.\\
77 - Leonard: Keep an eye on those expiration dates, I’ve been burned more than once.\\
78 - Penny: All right, sweetie, I’m not going to get involved in your relationship.\\
79 - Sheldon: Oh, come on. It’s just a simple favour. Now, when’s the last time I asked you to do something for me?\\
80 - Penny: Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.\\
81 - Sheldon: When is the last time I asked you to do something that wasn’t a medical emergency?\\
82 - Penny: Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.\\
83 - Sheldon: All right, then, I have no choice but to go on to plan B.\\
84 - Penny: What’s that?\\
85 - Sheldon: I’m going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.\\
86 - Scene: Amy’s car.\\
87 - Amy: Good morning.\\
88 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
89 - Amy: I think you’re really going to enjoy yourself today. Not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunt’s nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. It’s like a vacation for your teeth.\\
90 - Sheldon: All right.\\
91 - Amy: You sure you’re okay with this?\\
92 - Sheldon: Yes. I decided to find a way that I could have this experience and enjoy it.\\
93 - Amy: Thank you. That means a lot to me.\\
94 - Sheldon: Oh, don’t thank me. Thank wireless technology. I realized, I can go to your aunt’s awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends.\\
95 - Amy: Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and you’re going to be sitting there playing a game? Isn’t that a little rude?\\
96 - Sheldon: Oh, I got that covered. Headset. I won’t hear a word the old geezers are saying.\\
97 - Amy: You know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you don’t mind me showing up at a party all by myself after I’ve already told everybody I’ll be bringing somebody, then, fine. Go home and play your game.\\
98 - Sheldon: Thanks. Ooh, listen, I wouldn’t mind a piece of birthday cake, provided the old gal’s candle blow is clean and dry.\\
99 - Scene: The apartment.\\
100 - Raj: Here you go. I’ve got everything we’ll need for the big game. Low fat turkey jerky, low-carb beer, 100-calorie snack packs.\\
101 - Leonard: You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one.\\
102 - Raj: Hey, I plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much.\\
103 - Sheldon: Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice between playing for the Republic and the light side, or the Sith Empire and the dark side.\\
104 - Leonard: Well, we’re always the good guys. In D&D, we’re lawful good, in City Of Heroes, we’re the heroes, in Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat.\\
105 - Sheldon: Those women are prostitutes? You said they were raising money for stem cell research.\\
106 - Howard: Hey, guys, I got a surprise.\\
107 - Leonard: Uh, if it’s yoghurt that helps ladies poop, I think Raj beat you to it.\\
108 - Howard: No. Bernadette’s going to be playing with us. So, that’s pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah.\\
109 - Raj: What, you invited your girlfriend? This is supposed to be our weekend.\\
110 - Howard: I had no choice. Last night, she said, why don’t we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didn’t answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she’s parking the car right now.\\
111 - Sheldon: Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?\\
112 - Leonard: Uh, it is, but I think you might’ve waited too long for it to be funny. (Whip sound) I was wrong, it’s still funny.\\
113 - Sheldon: Oh, good. Hah-hah!\\
114 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
115 - Penny: Amy, what’s wrong?\\
116 - Amy: My boyfriend’s a jerk.\\
117 - Penny: Well, I know he didn’t cheat on you, so what happened?\\
118 - Amy: I had to go to my aunt’s party all by myself, and everybody was like, where’s this boyfriend you’re always talking about? Is he real, or did you make him up like Armin the miniature horse breeder?\\
119 - Penny: Who’s Armin the miniature horse breeder?\\
120 - Amy: The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back. It unravelled quickly when I couldn’t answer the question how’d you two meet?\\
121 - Penny: I would have thought at a miniature horse show.\\
122 - Amy: Oh, that’s good.\\
123 - Penny: Mm.\\
124 - Amy: I panicked and said Woodstock. I just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family.\\
125 - Penny: Sure, I get that. I mean, he’s your first boyfriend and all.\\
126 - Amy: Not just my first boyfriend, he’s the best boyfriend. I mean, think about it. I’m dating Sheldon Cooper.\\
127 - Penny: Yes. On purpose.\\
128 - Amy: He’s handsome, he’s lanky, he’s brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality.\\
129 - Penny: Well, sickly is the new sexy.\\
130 - Amy: Yeah.\\
131 - Penny: Mm. You know, Amy, sometimes when you’re in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt.\\
132 - Amy: Do you ever worry about Leonard doing that to you?\\
133 - Penny: That’s hilarious. No.\\
134 - Scene: The apartment.\\
135 - Bernadette: Get that guy! Get that guy! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!\\
136 - Sheldon: Dr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isn’t as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesn’t make the land speeder go.\\
137 - Bernadette: Pew!\\
138 - Leonard: Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.\\
139 - Raj: Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, I bet he didn’t know how much fun it was killing stuff.\\
140 - Leonard: All right, I think we got them all. Let’s divide up the loot.\\
141 - Bernadette: Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got. You should put on yours and then we’ll match.\\
142 - Howard: But I worked hard to get this armour.\\
143 - Bernadette: Sorry, I just thought it’d be nice if people knew we were a couple.\\
144 - Howard: Fine, I’ll change. (Whip sound) \\
145 - Sheldon: Hah-hah!\\
146 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
147 - Amy: I don’t think I want to play a game.\\
148 - Penny: Oh, come on. They’re playing one across the hall, we should, too. Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink. Then you get to go again…\\
149 - Amy: Like that?\\
150 - Penny: Wow. Yeah, b-beginner’s luck. So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again and we can… uh… all right. So, yeah, okay, now I’m gonna drink this entire cup and then I’m going to drink another one… Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?\\
151 - Amy: Spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. At a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting.\\
152 - Penny: Whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here. Hold on. (Sound of cheering)\\
153 - Amy: That’d be my boyfriend. Happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends than hanging out with me.\\
154 - Penny: Wars.\\
155 - Amy: What?\\
156 - Penny: Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the two up.\\
157 - Amy: What’s the difference?\\
158 - Penny: There’s absolutely no difference.\\
159 - Amy: How do I get him to treat me better?\\
160 - Penny: All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold s*x, but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So, I’d say give him the silent treatment.\\
161 - Amy: No, he loves that.\\
162 - Penny: Hmm.\\
163 - Amy: Our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours. He said it was a magical evening.\\
164 - Penny: All right, then we’re gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie, making a scene.\\
165 - Amy: I don’t think I’d be good at that.\\
166 - Penny: That’s why you’re lucky to have me. Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants I’m not allowed into. Both Chili’s.\\
167 - Scene: The apartment.\\
168 - Raj: Bernadette, remember, your character’s the healer in our group. You’re in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard.\\
169 - Bernadette: I can’t help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie.\\
170 - Sheldon: That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced. And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.\\
171 - Amy (bursting in): Sheldon Cooper, I’ve got a bone to pick with you, and I’m about to do it in front of all your friends.\\
172 - Penny: Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!\\
173 - Amy: I’m gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour.\\
174 - Penny: Ooh, burn!\\
175 - Amy: And if you don’t start treating me better, I’m leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named Armin.\\
176 - Sheldon: Armin who?\\
177 - Amy: Armin… damn it.\\
178 - Penny: Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family, and you stood her up, okay? Look at this adorable, smushy face. Smush, smush, smush, smush.\\
179 - Amy: You’re hurting me.\\
180 - Penny: No, Sheldon hurt you.\\
181 - Amy: Before; now it’s you.\\
182 - Penny: Oh.\\
183 - Sheldon: I think I understand. You’re the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can’t lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution.\\
184 - Penny: Sheldon, she doesn’t want your stupid…\\
185 - Amy: Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming. Let’s go.\\
186 - Sheldon: Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler. Let me get my coat. (Whip sound) Oh, grow up, Leonard.\\
187 - Raj: But e-excuse me, I have something to say. None of you may realize it, but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday, I’ll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!\\
188 - Penny: And that’s how a girl makes a scene. I’m sorry, sweetie. You’re right. You deserve your weekend. Come on, Amy, let’s go.\\
189 - Amy: What about the Science Center?\\
190 - Penny: I’ll let you hold my hair while I throw up.\\
191 - Amy: Rain check.\\
192 - Bernadette: I’m gonna go, too.\\
193 - Howard: I’ll miss you.\\
194 - Bernadette: I’ll miss you.\\
195 - Howard: I’ll miss you more.\\
196 - Bernadette: No, I’ll…\\
197 - Raj: Just leave! Okay, now. This is the way it’s supposed to be. Men together, fighting the forces of evil.\\
198 - All: Hear! Hear!\\
199 - Raj: I can’t believe this is only 64 calories.\\
200 - Scene: Some time later. The guys are asleep.\\
201 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard Joel Wolowitz! I’ve been worried sick for two days, and I know you turned off your phone! You open up this door right now because I’ve had it up to here! I have been to the morgue and the hospital, and I spent the last half hour walking up these ferkakta stairs!\\
202 - Howard: That’s my ride, got to go. (Whip sound)
\subsection {Episode 20: The Transporter Malfunction}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Penny: Oh my God, I love this chicken.\\
3 - Sheldon: Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free.\\
4 - Penny: Okay, you’re right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want.\\
5 - Sheldon: Oh, that’s very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, I’ll come a-knocking.\\
6 - Howard: Hey, Raj, you didn’t send your RSVP in. I’m supposed to ask you if you’re bringing someone to the wedding.\\
7 - Raj: I’ll let you know.\\
8 - Howard: Well, can you make it soon. There’s a battle royale going on over the seating charts. In one corner, Bernadette’s mom, and the other three, mine.\\
9 - Sheldon: Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home.\\
10 - Leonard: Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster’s wedding.\\
11 - Sheldon: They had a make your own sundae bar. Ooh, that was a night to remember. Do you know, on the one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts.\\
12 - Howard: Anyway, you gotta let me know if you have a plus one, because if not my mom’s trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck.\\
13 - Raj: Alright, uh, fine, I’m coming and I’m bringing somebody. Uh, Koothrappali plus one.\\
14 - Leonard: Who you bringing?\\
15 - Raj: Who are you bringing?\\
16 - Penny: He’s bringing me. Who are you bringing?\\
17 - Raj: Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O’Donnells.\\
18 - Howard: Come on, who is it?\\
19 - Raj: I’m not telling. I’m from Asia. I’m mysterious. Deal with it.\\
20 - Sheldon: Howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?\\
21 - Howard: No, uh, I don’t think so.\\
22 - Sheldon: Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness.\\

24 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
25 - Raj (on skype): Hello Mummy, Daddy, how are you?\\
26 - Mrs Koothrappali: Pretty good, can’t complain.\\
27 - Dr Koothrappali: Oh I’m sure you can. Just give it a minute.\\
28 - Raj: Listen, uh, there’s something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasn’t ready until now, but I think it’s time.\\
29 - Dr Koothrappali: It’s finally happening. You’re coming out of the closet, aren’t you?\\
30 - Mrs Koothrappali: We love you, and we accept your alternate lifestyle. Just keep it to yourself.\\
31 - Raj: No, I’m not gay. If anything, I’m metrosexual.\\
32 - Dr Koothrappali: What’s that?\\
33 - Raj: It means I like women as well as their skincare products.\\
34 - Dr Koothrappali: Well, if you’re not coming out, why did you call us during the cricket semi-finals?\\
35 - Raj: ‘Cause I, I’m tired of trying to meet someone and, I think I’d like you to help me find uh, a wife.\\
36 - Mrs Koothrappali: And just to clarify, a female wife?\\
37 - Raj: Yes.\\
38 - Dr Koothrappali: Matchmaking, very smart move son. Much better than marrying for love.\\
39 - Mrs Koothrappali: We married for love.\\
40 - Dr Koothrappali: And it’s been wonderful.\\
41 - Scene: The apartment.\\
42 - Sheldon: Quantum physics makes me so happy.\\
43 - Leonard: Yeah, I’m glad.\\
44 - Sheldon: It’s like looking at the universe naked. (Shivers) \\
45 - Penny: Hi, you guys got a minute?\\
46 - Leonard: Sure, what’s up?\\
47 - Penny: Well, I was thinking about Sheldon’s little joke the other night about me eating all your food.\\
48 - Sheldon: Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group’s resident cut-up.\\
49 - Leonard: I’m sorry, you are our resident cut-up?\\
50 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
51 - Leonard: Prove it.\\
52 - Sheldon: Knock, knock.\\
53 - Leonard: Who’s there?\\
54 - Sheldon: Interrupting physicist.\\
55 - Leonard: Interrupting physi…\\
56 - Sheldon: MUON!\\
57 - Penny: Anyway, I got a little residual cheque from my commercial and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. So, Sheldon, ta-da!\\
58 - Sheldon: Ah! A vintage, mint in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!\\
59 - Leonard: Where did you get that?\\
60 - Penny: Uh, from Stuart at the comic-book store.\\
61 - Leonard: You went to the comic-book store by yourself?\\
62 - Penny: Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good.\\
63 - Sheldon: Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.\\
64 - Penny: Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?\\
65 - Sheldon: Not this time. Then they wouldn’t be special. Thanks Penny.\\
66 - Penny: You’re welcome. Don’t worry, I didn’t forget about you. Leonard, I got you a label maker.\\
67 - Leonard: Wow. No, it’s great. Also, uh, mint in box.\\
68 - Penny: Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!\\
69 - Leonard: Awesome!\\
70 - Sheldon: Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure.\\
71 - Penny: Oh, that’s great. Let’s open it up and put him in there.\\
72 - Leonard: Ah!\\
73 - Sheldon: Oh dear Lord. No!\\
74 - Penny: Why, they’re just toys?\\
75 - Sheldon: They’re mint in box.\\
76 - Leonard: They’re Collectables.\\
77 - Penny: C’mon can’t we just open one up and take a…\\
78 - Together: No!\\
79 - Leonard: Once you open the box it loses its value.\\
80 - Penny: Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it.\\
81 - Scene: A restaurant.\\
82 - Bernadette: Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?\\
83 - Raj: Oh yes. In my culture it’s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here I look like six two.\\
84 - Bernadette: The nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. They used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit.\\
85 - Howard: Hindus do the same thing. Except they leave room for a cow.\\
86 - Raj: Listen, I love your charming racist humour, but any chance you could not knock my religion while she’s here.\\
87 - Howard: Yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox.\\
88 - Raj: It’s different. You’re people don’t worship lox.\\
89 - Howard: Well clearly you’ve never been to brunch with my cousins.\\
90 - Bernadette: So, arranged marriages. The parents just decide, and then you have to get married?\\
91 - Raj: Oh, no, no, I get a say in it. But I’m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I’ve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth.\\
92 - Girl: Excuse me, are you Rajesh?\\
93 - Raj: Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh, nice to meet you.\\
94 - Lakshmi: Nice to meet you too.\\
95 - Raj: Oh, uh, these are my, my friends. This is Bernadette.\\
96 - Bernadette: Hello.\\
97 - Raj: And this is Howard.\\
98 - Howard: Nice to meet you.\\
99 - Lakshmi: You too.\\
100 - Raj: Please have a seat. (To Bernadette) I’m thinking double wedding!\\
101 - Scene: The apartment.\\
102 - Voice of Spock: Dr Cooper. Dr Cooper?\\
103 - Sheldon: Is someone there?\\
104 - Spock: Down here, on your desk.\\
105 - Sheldon: Spock?\\
106 - Spock: I need to speak with you.\\
107 - Sheldon: Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.\\
108 - Spock: It is not the only logical explanation. For example, you could be hallucinating after being hit on the head by, say, a coconut.\\
109 - Sheldon: Was I hit on the head by a coconut.\\
110 - Spock: I’m not going to dignify that with a response. Now, to the matter at hand. You need to play with the transporter toy.\\
111 - Sheldon: But it’s mint in box.\\
112 - Spock: Yes, and to open it would destroy it’s value. But remember, like me, you also have a human half.\\
113 - Sheldon: Well, I’m not going to dignify that with a response.\\
114 - Spock: Consider this. What is the purpose of a toy?\\
115 - Sheldon: To be played with.\\
116 - Spock: Therefore? To not play with it would be?\\
117 - Sheldon: Illogical. Oh, damn it Spock, you’re right. I’ll do it.\\
118 - Spock: Sheldon, wait. You have to wake up first.\\
119 - Sheldon: Oh, of course. Set phasers to dumb, right? (Wakes up in bed) Goody, goody, goody. This is wrong. This is wrong. I’m so excited, but this is wrong. I’m gonna do it. I’m doing it. I did it. Oh, that’s what I always thought 1975 smelled like. One to beam down Mr Scott. Aye, aye, Mr Spock. Energise. (Spins toy). Energise. (Tries to spin toy. It sticks. Tries to get Spock out and toy falls apart.) Don’t be broken. Please don’t be broken. (To Spock toy) What did you make me do? Okay, okay, think. (Sees Leonard’s toy) It’s only logical.\\
120 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
121 - Lakshmi: My goodness, that was delicious.\\
122 - Raj: Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake.\\
123 - Lakshmi: Impressive. What goes into making something like that.\\
124 - Raj: Well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! Lava cake.\\
125 - Lakshmi: I bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here.\\
126 - Raj: Well, let’s see. Yup, three missed calls.\\
127 - Lakshmi: Four missed calls, two text messages, and a failed video chat. I win. So, what are we going to tell them.\\
128 - Raj: I’d like to tell them things are going well.\\
129 - Lakshmi: Me too. But before we get their hopes up we should probably make sure we’re on the same page.\\
130 - Raj: Okay, what page are you on?\\
131 - Lakshmi: I’m on the one where I’m on a lot of pressure from my parents to get married and settle down, and have a family, and I’m going to do it so they don’t find out I’m gay.\\
132 - Raj: Say again.\\
133 - Lakshmi: I’m gay.\\
134 - Raj: Like, dude on dude, but with women?\\
135 - Lakshmi: I know a fake marriage isn’t an honest way to live, but you of all people must know how difficult it is to come out in our culture.\\
136 - Raj: Why me, of all people?\\
137 - Lakshmi: Well, there is a rumour back in New Delhi that you’re, how shall we say, comfortable in a sari.\\
138 - Raj: I’m not gay.\\
139 - Lakshmi: Really? The chocolate lava cake? The little soaps in the bathroom? And I’m sorry, but you’re wearing more perfume than I am.\\
140 - Raj: That’s Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information, it’s unisex.\\
141 - Lakshmi: Fill in the blank. I love the nightlife?\\
142 - Raj: I like to boogie.\\
143 - Lakshmi: Got you.\\
144 - Raj: W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women.\\
145 - Lakshmi: That’s disappointing. You were exactly the kind of phoney-baloney husband I was looking for.\\
146 - Raj: Thankyou. And once again, my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You don’t want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.\\
147 - Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom. Sheldon writhes in bed, then wakes up on an alien planet. \\
148 - Sheldon: Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.\\
149 - Spock: Hello again, Sheldon.\\
150 - Sheldon: What is it now, tiny Spock?\\
151 - Spock: I am very disappointed in you. You broke your toy and switched it with Leonard’s. You should be ashamed of yourself.\\
152 - Sheldon: You’re the one who told me to play with it.\\
153 - Spock: If I told you to jump off the bridge of the Enterprise, would you do it?\\
154 - Sheldon: No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave.\\
155 - Spock: Trust me, it gets old after a while. You must right your wrong, Sheldon.\\
156 - Sheldon: Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and he’s never going to open it, so he won’t know it’s broken. And I have a toy that isn’t broken. Everybody’s happy.\\
157 - Spock: Well I am unhappy.\\
158 - Sheldon: I thought where you come from they don’t have emotions.\\
159 - Spock: I come from a factory in Taiwan. Now do the right thing.\\
160 - Sheldon: You know what you are? Well, you’re a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps it’s time you beam on out of here.\\
161 - Spock: Fine. I will just use the transporter. Oh, right. You broke it.\\
162 - Sheldon: Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energise. (Throws Spock away. Get’s attacked by a Gorn. Wakes up.) Ah. Tiny Spock. Help.\\
163 - Scene: Howard’s laboratory. Howard is soldering something.\\
164 - Raj: Ready for lunch?\\
165 - Howard: Yep, one sec. (Puts thing in mouth.) Ah, good. Ma would have killed me if she’d found out I’d broke my retainer.\\
166 - Raj: Hey, uh, can I run something by you? It’s about Lakshmi.\\
167 - Howard: Yeah. Sure. How are things going?\\
168 - Raj: We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And she’s a lesbian.\\
169 - Howard: What do you mean, she’s a lesbian?\\
170 - Raj: Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and they’d blow us off, and then we’d tell each other they were probably gay. It’s like that. Except this time it’s true.\\
171 - Howard: Then why did she even go out with you?\\
172 - Raj: She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know, it sounded crazy to me at first, but I’m actually thinking about doing it.\\
173 - Howard: Okay, well, so the reason that might sound crazy, is ’cause it’s crazy.\\
174 - Raj: Look, Howard, you’re in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises.\\
175 - Howard: Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadette’s or my mom’s.\\
176 - Raj: It’s a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don’t have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once I’m married, I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go.\\
177 - Howard: Why don’t you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn’t slept with more women than you.\\
178 - Raj: Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does.\\
179 - Howard: So you’re seriously thinking about marrying someone you’re never going to have s*x with.\\
180 - Raj: I can’t believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.\\
181 - Howard: Yes, to other gay people.\\
182 - Raj: Do you hear how homophobic you sound?\\
183 - Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is working on his laptop. Spock is looking at him judgementally. He switches the two toys.\\
184 - Sheldon: Oh, I don’t want a broken toy. (Switches them back again. Penny and Leonard enter.) Nothing!\\
185 - Leonard: What?\\
186 - Sheldon: Nothing. I said nothing.\\
187 - Penny: That was weird.\\
188 - Leonard: Really? I don’t even notice any more.\\
189 - Penny: I cannot believe you guys aren’t going to play with these.\\
190 - Leonard: Well I told you, you don’t, it’s mint in box.\\
191 - Penny: I dunno. I just think it’s a waste. (Picks up box. Sheldon screams.) Relax. I’m just looking at the box.\\
192 - Sheldon: Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands.\\
193 - Penny: What is your problem?\\
194 - Sheldon: My problem is that I don’t want you to break Leonard’s toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her.\\
195 - Penny: Leonard, I bought you this because I wanted you to have fun with it. I don’t want it to just sit in this box.\\
196 - Leonard: You know, you’re right. I mean, it’s from you, I’m never going to sell it. I’m opening it.\\
197 - Penny: Yes.\\
198 - Sheldon: Mmmmm!\\
199 - Leonard: It’s broken.\\
200 - Penny: What?\\
201 - Sheldon: Oh, nice job, man-hands.\\
202 - Penny: I didn’t break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.\\
203 - Sheldon: Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, let’s all be mad at Stuart.\\
204 - Penny: You know, I paid a lot for this. Let’s take it over there and show him.\\
205 - Leonard: Absolutely.\\
206 - Sheldon: Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didn’t tell you.\\
207 - Leonard: Why would you open mine?\\
208 - Sheldon: I didn’t. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.\\
209 - Leonard: Well, you should talk to Stuart.\\
210 - Sheldon: I can’t because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that’s a lie.\\
211 - Penny: What is the truth?\\
212 - Sheldon: My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.\\
213 - Leonard: Okay, that I believe.\\
214 - Penny: Mmm.\\
215 - Sheldon: Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That’s a lie.\\
216 - Leonard: So, is that one mine.\\
217 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
218 - Leonard: Well, hand it over so I can open it.\\
219 - Sheldon: Okay. Leonard, even though I don’t have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it.\\
220 - Leonard: And that’s a lie, right?\\
221 - Sheldon: Big fat whopper. I hope it breaks.\\
222 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
223 - Raj: This is a treat, what brings you guys by?\\
224 - Bernadette: Raj, Howie told me what’s going on with you and Lakshmi.\\
225 - Raj: What, you told her?\\
226 - Howard: I told everybody.\\
227 - Bernadette: We believe there’s someone out there who’ll love you for you.\\
228 - Howard: Well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldn’t marry this woman.\\
229 - Raj: So, while I’m waiting for this mysterious perfect match, who may or may not exist, I’m supposed to just be alone.\\
230 - Bernadette: Not necessarily. I think we’ve found someone for you to cuddle with. (Pulls a puppy out of her bag.)\\
231 - Raj: Oh, my goodness. Aren’t you the cutest little Yorkie ever? You got him for me?\\
232 - Howard: Her. We thought you two would hit it off.\\
233 - Raj: I think we already have. Thank you guys so much. Let’s see if you fit in my man purse.\\
234 - Bernadette: Metrosexual my ass.
\subsection {Episode 21: The Hawking Excitation}
1 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
2 - Howard: So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning.\\
3 - Raj: I don’t mean to burst your bubble, dude, but those penile enlargement pills do not work.\\
4 - Howard: Believe me, I know. The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking.\\
5 - Leonard: You’re kidding.\\
6 - Raj: Why?\\
7 - Howard: He’s coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture, and he’s looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair.\\
8 - Leonard: That’s amazing. You’ll be like his pit crew. A word of caution, I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him.\\
9 - Howard (in Stephen Hawking voice): You’re right. I suppose that could be considered offensive.\\
10 - Raj: Oh, boy, Sheldon’s going to freak out.\\
11 - Leonard: Yeah, he worships Hawking.\\
12 - Howard: I was actually thinking about bringing him along when I go over there so he can meet the great man.\\
13 - Raj: That’s really nice of you, Howard.\\
14 - Howard: Hm, it’s no big deal.\\
15 - Leonard: Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It’ll look so nice next to the ones he’s already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.\\
16 - Sheldon: Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity’s understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, it’s two a.m., get out of my bedroom?\\
17 - Leonard: Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?\\
18 - Sheldon: Well, I believe I’ve done it. And I’m only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it.\\
19 - Leonard: Really?\\
20 - Raj: That’s incredible. Oh, here, break out the math.\\
21 - Sheldon: Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking… Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isn’t going to make any sense to you.\\
22 - Howard: Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics.\\
23 - Sheldon: Yeah, good for you, and don’t stop working on it.\\
24 - Raj: Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?\\
25 - Howard: Yep.\\
26 - Leonard: Still going to introduce him?\\
27 - Howard: Not on your life.\\
28 - Credits sequence.\\
29 - Scene: A corridor.\\
30 - Sheldon: Please, please, please let me meet Hawking.\\
31 - Howard: I told you, no.\\
32 - Sheldon: But I said I’m sorry.\\
33 - Howard: No, you said, would it help if I said I’m sorry?\\
34 - Sheldon: And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?\\
35 - Howard: Sheldon, you’re a condescending jerk. Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?\\
36 - Sheldon: Um, to go to Jewish heaven?\\
37 - Howard: Jews don’t have heaven.\\
38 - Sheldon: Then to avoid Jewish hell?\\
39 - Howard: Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell.\\
40 - Sheldon: Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal.\\
41 - Howard: Oh, you can’t be serious.\\
42 - Sheldon: Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there’s another human being.\\
43 - Howard: Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?\\
44 - Sheldon: Yeah, okay, I can see you’re going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps.\\
45 - Howard: Get out of my lab.\\
46 - Sheldon: Oh, now they’re so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?\\
47 - Howard: Get out.\\
48 - Sheldon: How about dolphins?\\
49 - Howard: Out!\\
50 - Scene: The apartment.\\
51 - Leonard: So, come on, how was the first day with Hawking?\\
52 - Howard: It was great. We talked about movies.\\
53 - Sheldon: Oh!\\
54 - Howard: I showed him some card tricks.\\
55 - Sheldon: Oh!\\
56 - Howard: He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.\\
57 - Sheldon: Oh!\\
58 - Howard: Something got you down there, bunky?\\
59 - Sheldon: Howard, please, I’m begging you.\\
60 - Leonard: Raj, you’re our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?\\
61 - Raj: Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesn’t believe in to end his life quickly.\\
62 - Sheldon: Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old, I dressed up as him for Halloween.\\
63 - Howard: You’re kidding.\\
64 - Sheldon: No, sir, no, I took my dad’s desk chair, attached a Speak & Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy.\\
65 - Howard: You don’t seem to be understanding the English word no. Maybe a different language will help. Russian, nyet. Chinese, bu. Japanese, iie. Klingon, qo. Binary coded Ascii, 0110111001101111.\\
66 - Sheldon: It’s actually 01100111.\\
67 - Howard: No!\\
68 - Sheldon: I’m not asking for me, I’m asking for Hawking.\\
69 - Howard: Let me try gansta, hells no.\\
70 - Sheldon: Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough I’ve made, he’ll reach out to me.\\
71 - Leonard: What if he doesn’t?\\
72 - Sheldon: He will, he’s really smart.\\
73 - Howard: That’s an interesting idea. Why don’t you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?\\
74 - Sheldon: How do I do that?\\
75 - Howard: You walk away.\\
76 - Sheldon: Walking away.\\
77 - Leonard: You do realize you own his ass right now.\\
78 - Howard: I do.\\
79 - Raj: You can make him do anything you want.\\
80 - Howard: Yeah, I know, I’m just trying to figure out how much I want to punish him.\\
81 - Raj: Well, don’t be too mean.\\
82 - Sheldon: Hey, fellas, I’m thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some.\\
83 - Raj: I wouldn’t mind a glass.\\
84 - Sheldon: I wasn’t talking to you.\\
85 - Raj: Bring him to his bony knees.\\
86 - Howard: Sheldon, come on back.\\
87 - Sheldon: Yes, yes. What did you decide?\\
88 - Howard: I’ll give your paper to Professor Hawking.\\
89 - Sheldon: Great, thank you. Oh, that’s terrific.\\
90 - Howard: But in exchange, I’d like you to do a few things for me.\\
91 - Sheldon: What kinds of things?\\
92 - Howard: Are you familiar with the 12 labours of Hercules?\\
93 - Sheldon: Of course.\\
94 - Howard: You should be so lucky.\\
95 - Scene: Howard’s bedroom.\\
96 - Sheldon: All right. What would you like me to do first?\\
97 - Howard: Well, I thought I’d start you off by polishing my belt buckles.\\
98 - Sheldon: Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw’s silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat.\\
99 - Howard: That’s nice.\\
100 - Sheldon: That’s a lot of belt buckles.\\
101 - Howard: Funny thing is, I only have one belt. Anyway, I’ll let you get started. Oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what you’re seeing there is splash back.\\
102 - Sheldon: You make sissy on your belt buckles? Mee-Maw’s forks never had that.\\
103 - Howard: Here is a black light to check them. And for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room.\\
104 - (Later)\\
105 - Howard: Sheldon, these look great. They’re like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. How’d you get them so shiny?\\
106 - Sheldon: Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off.\\
107 - Howard: Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.\\
108 - Sheldon: My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?\\
109 - Howard: Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong.\\
110 - Sheldon: And you want me to return it for you?\\
111 - Howard: No, no, no, mon petit cherie.\\
112 - Scene: The cafeteria. Sheldon enters in the French maid costume.\\
113 - Sheldon: What are you all staring at? Didn’t you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?\\
114 - Scene: The laundry room.\\
115 - Penny: Hey.\\
116 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
117 - Penny: It’s not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?\\
118 - Sheldon: This is not my laundry.\\
119 - Penny: Wow, are these Amy’s? Kind of trashy, good for her.\\
120 - Sheldon: Those are Howard’s.\\
121 - Penny: Ugh. Why are you washing Howard’s man panties?\\
122 - Sheldon: Because if I don’t, he won’t give my paper to Stephen Hawking. He’s a famous physicist.\\
123 - Penny: Yeah, yeah, I know, he’s the wheelchair dude who invented time.\\
124 - Sheldon: That’s close enough.\\
125 - Penny: I don’t understand, why doesn’t Howard just introduce you to the guy?\\
126 - Sheldon: Because he’s punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You don’t think I’m condescending, do you?\\
127 - Penny: Well…\\
128 - Sheldon: Oh, I’m sorry, condescending means…\\
129 - Penny: I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down.\\
130 - Sheldon: Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone.\\
131 - Penny: Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet.\\
132 - Sheldon: Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.\\
133 - Penny: See, there it is, there’s that twinkle.\\
134 - Sheldon: Well, I can’t help it. That’s an involuntary twinkle.\\
135 - Penny: What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?\\
136 - Sheldon: I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.\\
137 - Penny: Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason.\\
138 - Sheldon: I knew it.\\
139 - Scene: Howard’s bedroom.\\
140 - Howard: What’s the matter?\\
141 - Bernadette: Every time I spend the night, your mom slaps me on the behind and says, go get ‘im.\\
142 - Howard: It’s not her fault. She’s getting hormone replacement therapy. Makes her crazy horny. Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the French maid’s costume.\\
143 - Bernadette: Oh, my God, that’s terrible.\\
144 - Howard: Hey, I gave you first crack at it.\\
145 - Bernadette: Why are you doing that? You’re being mean to him.\\
146 - Howard: He’s mean to me all the time. You’ve heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.\\
147 - Bernadette: If you don’t want to get teased about that, get a doctorate. I have one, they’re great.\\
148 - Howard: Oh, come on, the man torments me. I’m just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine.\\
149 - Bernadette: It’s not the same thing. Sheldon doesn’t know when he’s being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.\\
150 - Howard: Fine, I’ll just make him do a couple more things, then I’ll stop.\\
151 - Bernadette: No, you have to stop now.\\
152 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Bernadette, I want to remind you, you promised to take me dress shopping tomorrow!\\
153 - Bernadette: Oh, damn. I’m sorry, I can’t make it, but Sheldon’s going to go with you! And that’s the last thing you do to him.\\
154 - Scene: A shop changing rooms.\\
155 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Sheldon! I need your help!\\
156 - Sheldon: What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?\\
157 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): It’s this dress. When I put my front in, my back pops out. When I put my back in, my front pops out. It’s like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub!\\
158 - Sheldon: What do you want me to do?\\
159 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): We’re gonna have to work as a team. Get in here, grab a handful, and start stuffing.\\
160 - Sheldon (off): I’m not sure how to do this.\\
161 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): It’s easy, just pretend you’re putting away a sleeping bag.\\
162 - Sheldon (off): Sleeping bags don’t usually sweat this much, but okay.\\
163 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Now zip me up.\\
164 - Sheldon (off): Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond.\\
165 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): You’re right, who am I kidding? You should have seen me when I was young, Sheldon. The fellas used to line up and bring me boxes of candy. Why did I eat it all? Would you hold me?\\
166 - Sheldon: Oh, no, you know, I’m not really the holding kind of… Oh!\\
167 - Scene: The apartment.\\
168 - Howard: Oh, guys, I just remembered. I got you some Hawking souvenirs.\\
169 - Leonard: What are these?\\
170 - Howard: Gears and springs from his wheelchair. Pretty cool, huh?\\
171 - Raj: Wow, that’s amazing.\\
172 - Howard: Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went.\\
173 - Sheldon: I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother.\\
174 - Howard: I should have sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file.\\
175 - Sheldon: Humorous. Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?\\
176 - Howard: I don’t know.\\
177 - Sheldon: Oh, for heaven’s sake. I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, I, I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom.\\
178 - Howard: All right, Sheldon, there’s only one thing left I want you to do. Don’t worry, it’s an easy one.\\
179 - Sheldon: Okay.\\
180 - Howard: Give me a compliment.\\
181 - Sheldon: Fine. You have very tiny hands.\\
182 - Howard: No, about my job. I want you to tell me I’m good at what I do.\\
183 - Sheldon: You’re obviously good at what you do.\\
184 - Howard: Well, then why are you always ripping on me?\\
185 - Sheldon: Oh, I understand the confusion. I have never said that you are not good at what you do. It’s just that what you do is not worth doing.\\
186 - Leonard: It’s nicer than anything he’s ever said to me. I’d take it and run.\\
187 - Howard: Thank you, Sheldon.\\
188 - Sheldon: Now will you give my paper to Hawking?\\
189 - Howard: Sorry, I can’t.\\
190 - Sheldon: What, why not?\\
191 - Howard: I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you.\\
192 - Sheldon: All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Please let Professor Hawking know that I’m available at his earliest convenience.\\
193 - Raj: I thought he might be a little more excited.\\
194 - Leonard: Give it a second. (Sound of Sheldon shrieking in joy in his bedroom)\\
195 - Scene: Stephen Hawking’s office.\\
196 - Sheldon: Professor Hawking, it’s an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir.\\
197 - Hawking: I know.\\
198 - Sheldon: I want to thank you for taking time to see me.\\
199 - Hawking: My pleasure. I enjoyed reading your paper very much. You clearly have a brilliant mind.\\
200 - Sheldon: I know.\\
201 - Hawking: Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole accelerating backwards through time is fascinating.\\
202 - Sheldon: Thank you. It just, it came to me one morning in the shower.\\
203 - Hawking: That’s nice. Too bad it’s wrong.\\
204 - Sheldon: What do you mean wrong?\\
205 - Hawking: You made an arithmetic mistake on page two. It was quite the boner.\\
206 - Sheldon: No, no, th-th-th-that can’t be right. I-I don’t make arithmetic mistakes.\\
207 - Hawking: Are you saying I do?\\
208 - Sheldon: Oh, no, no, no, of course not. It’s just, I was thinking… Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking.\\
209 - Hawking: Great, another fainter.
\subsection {Episode 22: The Stag Convergence}
1 - Scene: The cafeteria. Sheldon laughs to himself.\\
2 - Sheldon: I wish you could all be inside my head. The conversation is sparkling. (Pause) Fine, I’ll tell you. A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and algae. If you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? Hint, there is a right answer. None of you will get it.\\
3 - Raj: Okay, uh, I’d pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck I’ve always dreamed of having.\\
4 - Sheldon: Wrong. Leonard?\\
5 - Leonard: Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth.\\
6 - Sheldon: Wrong, and let’s keep it clean, shall we?\\
7 - Howard: Kangaroo, uh, I’d be a Kanga-Jew. The first of my people to dunk a basketball.\\
8 - Leonard: Also instead of just living in your mother’s house, you could actually live inside her body.\\
9 - Sheldon: Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, you’d be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad.\\
10 - Leonard: Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.\\
11 - Sheldon: All right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert. Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus, I have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. And no thank you, expensive concessions. Because as an algae, I’ll just snack on this sunlight.\\
12 - Raj: He got us again.\\
13 - Leonard: No, he didn’t.\\
14 - Raj: Anyway, if it’s okay with you, we should talk about Howard’s bachelor party.\\
15 - Sheldon: Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, you’re half swan.\\
16 - Raj: I’ve been doing some research on strippers. One agency I spoke to, said I could get us a great price if we’re flexible on age range and number of limbs.\\
17 - Howard: Sounds like loads of fun, but I promised Bernadette no strippers.\\
18 - Raj: You don’t want strippers? You’re the king of strippers. The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.\\
19 - Howard: What can I tell ya, I’m not into that stuff any more.\\
20 - Leonard: Good for you, Howard. I’m proud of you. And still, you’re the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special.\\
21 - Sheldon: You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.\\
22 - Howard: Well, it’s probably not for me.\\
23 - Raj: Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They’ve got that wine train.\\
24 - Sheldon: Boo, wine! But yay, trains. I’m in.\\
25 - Raj: Anyway, it’s a beautiful time of year. Uh, you travel through the vineyards. There’s a tasting on board. And all the wild flowers are in bloom. It’s magic.\\
26 - Leonard: Look at that, in 30 seconds, we went from hiring women to being them.\\
27 - Credits sequence.\\
28 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
29 - Penny: So, I hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight.\\
30 - Leonard: Yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and scotch. Nothing to worry about.\\
31 - Penny: Why should I worry?\\
32 - Leonard: Well, I don’t know. It’s a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn’t that make you a little jealous?\\
33 - Penny: Oh, come on Leonard, it’s you. What’s going to happen? I mean, even if there was a stripper, all you’d do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework.\\
34 - Leonard: Hey, I am a young man in his sexual prime. Under the right conditions, I-I-I am capable of just, really crazy stuff.\\
35 - Penny: Really? What is the craziest thing you’ve ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had s*x in the ocean does not count.\\
36 - Leonard: Oh, come on, that’s got to count. There was a really strong undertow, we could have died.\\
37 - Penny: Well, have fun tonight.\\
38 - Leonard: Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen.\\
39 - Penny: Yeah, there is.\\
40 - Leonard: You know, there’s nothing wrong helping some woman’s kid get through their S.A.T.’s.\\
41 - Scene: A restaurant.\\
42 - Leonard: Hey, I got to hand it to Raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.\\
43 - Sheldon: It’s not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.\\
44 - Leonard: Are you drinking whisky?\\
45 - Sheldon: Indeed. If I’m to participate in the social convention that is the stag night, then I must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. Jeepers! That’s yucky.\\
46 - Leonard: Whoa, it’s a little early to start dropping J-bombs, don’t you think?\\
47 - Wil Wheaton: Hey, you guys.\\
48 - Leonard: Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard.\\
49 - Wil: Well, it was either this or another hot tub party at George Takei’s house.\\
50 - Sheldon: I’m confused. I thought since our reconciliation, I was your friend in this group.\\
51 - Wil: Oh, I’m friends with Howard too.\\
52 - Sheldon: Oh. I guess you’re just friends with anybody. (Drinks) Aagh!\\
53 - Stuart: Hey, uh, Leonard, things are a little tight at the comic book store. I might need some help covering my share of the check.\\
54 - Leonard: Oh, yeah, no worries.\\
55 - Stuart: And maybe a few bucks for the valet.\\
56 - Leonard: Oh, all right.\\
57 - Stuart: And gas money to get home.\\
58 - Leonard: Yeah, sure.\\
59 - Stuart: Great. You know what? This is my grandfather’s watch.\\
60 - Leonard: Oh.\\
61 - Stuart: 18-carat gold, got it in Europe during the war.\\
62 - Leonard: Wow, that’s very nice.\\
63 - Stuart: Mm-hmm. A hundred bucks and it’s yours.\\
64 - Raj: Hey, everybody! The bachelor boy has arrived! For he’s a jolly good fellow…\\
65 - All (joining in): For he’s a jolly good fellow, for he’s a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny.\\
66 - Kripke: Yes, yes, yes. He’s a jowwy good fewwow. What time do the stwippers awwive?\\
67 - Howard: Actually, Barry, we’re not going to have strippers tonight.\\
68 - Kripke: Ah, then what the fwig did I get two hundwed dowwaws in singles out for?\\
69 - Stuart: You want to buy a watch?\\
70 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
71 - Amy (into a mini-cam): This is Maid of Honour Amy Farrah Fowler, bringing you the wedding activities just weeks out from the big day. Let’s check in with a beautiful, radiant young woman, and her friend who’s about to get married. Ladies, can you tell us what you’re doing?\\
72 - Bernadette: Um, these are gift bags we’re going to put in the hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests. This is a map of Pasadena. This is a list of local restaurants. And then, for Howie’s relatives, we have antihistamines, antacids, and medicine for diarrhoea and constipation.\\
73 - Penny: Yeah, we labeled them stop and go.\\
74 - Amy: All right, pivoting to the big question. Bernadette, on your wedding night you’ll be consummating your marriage. What do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife?\\
75 - Bernadette: Amy, please.\\
76 - Amy: Keeping in mind that whoever’s on top may set the tone for the marriage.\\
77 - Penny: Okay, show’s over.\\
78 - Amy: Hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night. Don’t you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened?\\
79 - Penny: I don’t care. Ask her things like are you going to take Howard’s name? Not who’s going to sit on who?\\
80 - Bernadette: I’ve actually been thinking I’m going to hyphenate: Bernadette Mary-Ann Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.\\
81 - Penny: Nice. You know, you should totally get BernadetteMaryAnnRostenkowskiWolowitz.com before someone snaps it up.\\
82 - Bernadette: Howard already took care of it. Plus, he set up our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our family histories. Do you know, for a while in Poland, my family and his family were neighbours.\\
83 - Penny: Oh, that’s cool.\\
84 - Amy: No, it’s not. I’ll explain it to you later.\\
85 - Scene: The restaurant.\\
86 - Raj: May I have your attention, please? We are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard Wolowitz.\\
87 - All: Hear! Hear!\\
88 - Sheldon: And, apparently, Wil Wheaton’s best friend.\\
89 - Wil: Sheldon…\\
90 - Sheldon: Talk to the hand.\\
91 - Raj: Does anyone have any words they’d like to say about our man of the evening?\\
92 - Sheldon: Yeah, I do. (All groan). As is the tradition, I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at Howard’s expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard, I always thought you’d be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right? Let’s see here. Oh, seriously though, Howard, you’re actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And that’s a zinger, because you’re not. I’ve always thought that you’d make someone a fine husband someday. Assuming you’d be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which I don’t see as likely. Hacha! Okay, let me see here. Okay, kidding aside, Howard, you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness. Bazinga, I don’t!\\
93 - Leonard: Sheldon…\\
94 - Sheldon: Doubleazinga! I do! Good luck following that.\\
95 - Leonard: So, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. He was a wild one. Well, I guess we all kind of were. I remember this one time, I was with this girl at the beach. We were in the ocean and we started making out. I know, it was crazy. I wasn’t even wearing my Aquasocks. Then…\\
96 - Kripke: Nobody cares, Hofstadter. Wwap it up.\\
97 - Leonard: Right. To Howard.\\
98 - All: To Howard.\\
99 - Leonard: I totally had s*x in the ocean.\\
100 - Stuart: Okay, I’ll go. Howard, when I think about you and Bernadette starting this wonderful life together, I can’t help but get a little choked up. I mean, look at you. You have everything. Look at me. I’m 37. I sleep in the back of a comic book store, and I have the bone density of an 80-year-old man. To Howard.\\
101 - Raj: Yeah, to Howard. Um, uh, who’s next?\\
102 - Kripke: I’ll go. Howard, I’m gonna say something to you that evewybody’s thinking but no one has the couwage to say out woud. When you invite a man to a bachewor pawty, the impwication is, there will be stwippews. Maybe not compwetewy nude, but at weast pasties and G-stwings. That’s not unweasonable.\\
103 - Raj: Hear, hear.\\
104 - All: Hear, hear.\\
105 - Raj: Okay, uh, anybody else? Huh? No? Okay, it all comes down to me, the best man. Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper. Okay, when I first came to this country, I-I didn’t know how to behave or how to dress, or what was cool, I was pretty lonely. But then I met Howard, and suddenly, my life changed, because we could be lonely together. This man became my whole world.\\
106 - Kripke: Yeah, nice speech, Fwancine. (Tucks a dollar in Raj’s pants.) \\
107 - Raj: I’m not done, but thank you. (Raj puts the dollar on the table. Stuart steals it.) I think back to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him I’m addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin.\\
108 - Howard: She was my second cousin.\\
109 - Sheldon: And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. Ba-da-bazinga!\\
110 - Raj: Oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one’s my favourite!\\
111 - Howard: Okay, buddy, that’s it. Sit down.\\
112 - Raj: Oh, oh, what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?\\
113 - Howard: Don’t remember. Please sit down.\\
114 - Raj: The only threesome I’ve ever had in my life, and I’m proud to say it was with this man right here.\\
115 - Howard: Oh, please shut up.\\
116 - Raj: Oh, oh, don’t get me wrong, nothing happened with me and Howard. There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us.\\
117 - Wil (filming on his phone): Oh, Internet, this is so going all over you.\\
118 - Sheldon: Jeepers, I’m drunk.\\
119 - Scene: Bernadette’s car.\\
120 - Howard: Thank you for picking us up. There’s a warning, right there, on the scotch bottle. You cannot be operatin’ heavy machinery after you had a snootful of this, laddie!\\
121 - Bernadette: Funny. You boys have a nice time?\\
122 - Howard: Yeah, it was great. And low-key, like I promised. No hanky-panky, no strippers. Just the guys telling jokes.\\
123 - Bernadette: That’s nice.\\
124 - Howard: How about you? Did you have a fun night? Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this.\\
125 - Raj’s Voice: Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one’s my favourite.\\
126 - Raj: You know, we’re not that far from my apartment. If you stop the car, I can walk from here.\\
127 - Bernadette: You ain’t goin’ anywhere, Threeway.\\
128 - Howard: Bernadette, listen…\\
129 - Bernadette: You lied to me. You said you told me about all the girls you’ve been with, but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute or Raj!\\
130 - Raj: Seriously, you don’t even have to stop the car. Anything under ten miles an hour and I can combat-roll into the street.\\
131 - Howard: Okay, just to set the record straight, I didn’t hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him. Shame on you, Raj. That is not how we treat women in this country.\\
132 - Bernadette: Don’t you try and blame this on him.\\
133 - Raj: Thank you, Bernadette.\\
134 - Bernadette: Zip it, pervert!\\
135 - Scene: Bernadette’s apartment.\\
136 - Bernadette: I don’t know what I’m going to do. I’m supposed to marry Howard in a couple of weeks and I’m not sure I even know who the man is any more.\\
137 - Amy: I’m curious what’s bothering you most, the borderline incest, the prostitute or group s*x with the girl dressed as the children’s cartoon?\\
138 - Penny: Amy, remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn’t?\\
139 - Amy: Right. And that was…\\
140 - Penny: Not.\\
141 - Bernadette: When I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother.\\
142 - Penny: Well, if that’s what you like, I’ll take you to the comic book store, the place is full of ‘em.\\
143 - Bernadette: Wait a minute. You set me up with Howard. Did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?\\
144 - Penny: Well, a little. You hear stuff.\\
145 - Bernadette: Why didn’t you tell me\\
146 - Penny: Well, I was gonna, but I didn’t think it would go past the first date. Then, when it did, I thought for sure it wouldn’t go past you meeting his mother. Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. I mean, the warning signs were there, this is really on you.\\
147 - Bernadette: My God! I thought you were my friend. (Runs to bedroom)\\
148 - Amy: I don’t think that was helpful.\\
149 - Scene: The apartment. Howard is on the phone.\\
150 - Howard: Hi, Bernie, it’s me again. Please call me back.\\
151 - Raj: Dude, I am so sorry.\\
152 - Howard: It’s not your fault, it’s mine. I did all that stuff, not you.\\
153 - Leonard: Actually, you did do one of them together.\\
154 - Sheldon: Here.\\
155 - Howard: What is this?\\
156 - Sheldon: You’re upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.\\
157 - Howard: No, but what is it?\\
158 - Sheldon: Chicken broth. It seemed culturally appropriate. Also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and it’s been bothering me for the last eight years. So, as they say, two birds.\\
159 - Howard: I don’t know what my next move is.\\
160 - Leonard: Well, Howard, I don’t know much about women.\\
161 - Howard: Yeah?\\
162 - Leonard: No, uh, that, that’s it. I don’t know much about women. Raj, you got anything?\\
163 - Raj: I’ve got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.\\
164 - Howard: I’m not calling the girl from Comic-con.\\
165 - Raj: All right. More Sailor Moon for me.\\
166 - Sheldon: I just threw up the bachelor party.\\
167 - Scene: Bernadette’s apartment.\\
168 - Penny: Please come out, Bernadette. Let’s talk through this.\\
169 - Bernadette: No, leave me alone.\\
170 - Amy: Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine. Do you have a cousin who you find attractive?\\
171 - Penny: Amy.\\
172 - Amy: Hey, you introduced him to the sleazebag. I’m just trying to clean up your mess.\\
173 - Howard (at the door): Oh, hi.\\
174 - Penny: Hey.\\
175 - Howard: I need to talk to Bernadette.\\
176 - Penny: Well, I don’t think she wants to talk to anyone right now.\\
177 - Howard: All right, well, could you at least give her a message?\\
178 - Penny: Yeah, sure, I guess.\\
179 - Howard: Tell her I’m really sorry, and if she doesn’t want to marry me, I get it. But what I really want her to know is the guy that she’s disgusted by, is the guy that I’m disgusted by, too. But that guy doesn’t exist any more, he’s gone, and the reason is because of her. So, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you.\\
180 - Penny: Oh, my God, Howard. That’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard. And it came out of you.\\
181 - Bernadette: Howie?\\
182 - Howard: Penny has a message for you.\\
183 - Bernadette: I heard. Your voice, not unlike your mother’s, travels through walls.\\
184 - Howard: Do you want me to go?\\
185 - Bernadette: No. Come here. I’m still really mad at you.\\
186 - Howard: I get that.\\
187 - Bernadette: Is there anything else about your past I should know?\\
188 - Howard: Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas. I’ll tell you later.\\
189 - Bernadette: Okay.\\
190 - Howard: So, is the wedding still on?\\
191 - Bernadette: Yeah, the wedding’s still on. (They hug)\\
192 - Amy: Oh, thank God. I’m still a maid of honour. (Joins in the hug)\\
193 - Penny: Oh, what the hell. (Joins in too)\\
194 - Amy: This is kind of hot.\\
195 - Scene: The laundry room. Leonard enters in his dressing gown.\\
196 - Leonard: Hello.\\
197 - Penny: What’s with the robe?\\
198 - Leonard (taking it off): I’m gonna have s*x with you right here, right now, on that washing machine.\\
199 - Penny: No, you’re not.\\
200 - Leonard: Come on, please.\\
201 - Penny: If you want to do something, you can help me fold this sheet.\\
202 - Leonard: Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy.
\subsection {Episode 23: The Launch Acceleration}
1 - Scene: Howard’s laboratory. The phone rings. Howard puts it on speaker.\\
2 - Howard: Howard Wolowitz.\\
3 - Voice: Hey, Howard. Dave Roeger here at NASA. We need to talk about your upcoming mission.\\
4 - Howard: Yes, yes, I’ve been doing my push-ups. I’m still stuck at nine, but that’s going all the way down with no one holding me.\\
5 - Roeger: That’s great, uh, but that’s not why I called. We’ve run into a bit of a snafu. Your Soyuz capsule failed the pressurization test, so bottom line, mission’s been scrubbed.\\
6 - Howard (Picks up receiver): You’re kidding. So what does that mean? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Boy, I got to tell you, I’m really disappointed. This was my dream ever since I was a little kid. Okay, well, uh, thanks for the call. Yep, you, too. (Puts down phone.) Yes! Thank you! Oh! Oh! I’m not gonna die in space! I’m gonna die the way God intended, in my late 50s, with a heart full of pastrami.\\
7 - Credits sequence.\\
8 - Scene: A suit shop.\\
9 - Sheldon (off): I’m going to need a larger shirt. This one’s a little tight under the arms.\\
10 - Assistant: Okay.\\
11 - Leonard: Do you think maybe it’s tight because you’re wearing long underwear?\\
12 - Sheldon: Yes, of course that’s why it’s tight.\\
13 - Leonard: All right, let me rephrase the question. Why are you wearing long underwear?\\
14 - Sheldon: You’re kidding. Shouldn’t the question be why aren’t you?\\
15 - Leonard: No, it should be: why are you?\\
16 - Sheldon: Leonard, these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. I don’t like my own sweat touching my skin, how do you think I feel about theirs?\\
17 - Assistant: Why don’t you slip this on?\\
18 - Sheldon: Said the hangman offering a noose.\\
19 - Raj: Well, that wasn’t as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes, but it was right up there.\\
20 - Howard: Well, that’s it. My orders have been rescinded. I am officially no go to space.\\
21 - Leonard: I’m sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you, I’m a little relieved you’re not going.\\
22 - Howard: Why?\\
23 - Leonard: Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians.\\
24 - Howard: Yeah, so?\\
25 - Leonard: When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say, ooh, check out this Blu-ray player, it must be good, it was built in Russia”?\\
26 - Howard: Well, their technology isn’t that bad.\\
27 - Raj: When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule, you free-fall from space at 500 miles per hour, and the only thing that slows you down is a little parachute that pops out right before you crash into the ground. And the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture Rocky and Bullwinkle.\\
28 - Howard: All right, well, whatever. I wasn’t worried.\\
29 - Raj: You weren’t?\\
30 - Howard: Let me explain the difference between you and me. You watch Star Trek. I live it.\\
31 - Raj: Oh, please. I don’t remember the episode of Star Trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store.\\
32 - Howard: Make all the jokes you want, but there’s only one of us here brave enough to almost do what I almost did.\\
33 - Sheldon: Ah, much better.\\
34 - Leonard: You must be burning up.\\
35 - Sheldon: A little. But not more than your urethras will be after whatever’s in those pants swims up them. Well, I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don’t I? I look like the Flash about to get married. Oh! A tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!\\
36 - Assistant: Uh, where’s he going?\\
37 - Leonard: He keeps emergency Purell in the car.\\
38 - Sheldon: Keys! Keys! Keys!\\
39 - Scene: Penny’s door.\\
40 - Penny: Hey, you.\\
41 - Leonard: Before I come in, you should know, I have gas. (Holds up gas canister) \\
42 - Penny: For the record, not your worst opening line.\\
43 - Leonard: Check it out. It’s the gas I use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. But it also has an interesting secondary use. Here. Breathe this in.\\
44 - Penny: B-Before I do it, if you’re a cop you have tell me, right?\\
45 - Leonard: Just try it.\\
46 - Penny: Okay. (In weirdly low voice) What’s it supposed to… Oh, my God, this is so freaky!\\
47 - Leonard (in low voice): You’re a mean one Mr. Grinch.\\
48 - Penny: Okay. Me, me, me. Ready? (Low voice) Leonard, I am your father.\\
49 - Leonard: I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life.\\
50 - Penny: Oh, Mm. Hey, you know how we’ve been taking things slow?\\
51 - Leonard: Mm-hmm.\\
52 - Penny: Well, I’ve been thinking, and maybe I’m ready to take things a little faster.\\
53 - Leonard: Oh, great.\\
54 - Penny: Mm-hmm.\\
55 - Leonard: And I promise, after waiting four months, fast is what you’re gonna get.\\
56 - Penny: You know, just-just one thing. Look, we’re in a really great place right now, and I don’t want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again.\\
57 - Leonard: So we won’t let it get weird.\\
58 - Penny: Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up, mm, since the last time you saw me naked, I got a Cookie Monster tattoo. The acceptable responses when you see it are awesome or nothing.\\
59 - Leonard: What about (inhales gas, in low voice) Cookies!\\
60 - Scene: Amy’s apartment.\\
61 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?\\
62 - Amy: Seven o’clock, right on time.\\
63 - Sheldon: It’s not an accident. I waited outside your door for twenty minutes.\\
64 - Amy: Well, dinner’s almost ready.\\
65 - Sheldon: I must say, I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. As I mentioned, the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale. You ask anyone, that’s a hot date.\\
66 - Amy: Tempting choices, but I have something special planned for tonight.\\
67 - Sheldon: What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?\\
68 - Amy: With our friends moving forward in their relationships, I’ve decided that we should make progress in ours as well.\\
69 - Sheldon: Oh, dear Lord. Two years ago, we didn’t even know each other, and now I’m in your apartment after dark. How much faster can this thing go?\\
70 - Amy: I had a feeling you’d be reluctant, which is why I’m going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks.\\
71 - Sheldon: Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away.\\
72 - Amy: I have devised an experiment that I believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.\\
73 - Sheldon: And how do you propose to do that? Uh, hope you’re not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control. Because there’s only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and that’s called school.\\
74 - Amy: Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up. In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera. I’m going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me.\\
75 - Sheldon: Well, seems what’s on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock.\\
76 - Amy: We’ll see. Let’s start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?\\
77 - Sheldon: Super Mario Bros. theme?\\
78 - Amy: Yes.\\
79 - Sheldon: I see what you’re doing. You’re attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game, admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood, but it won’t work.\\
80 - Amy: Fine. There’s no reason we still can’t have a lovely dinner. Why don’t you have a seat.\\
81 - Sheldon: Da-da-da da-da dum, boink, boink.\\
82 - Amy: May I offer you something to drink?\\
83 - Sheldon: You know I don’t drink.\\
84 - Amy: Not even strawberry Quik?\\
85 - Sheldon: I love strawberry Quik. It’s my favourite pink fluid, narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol.\\
86 - Amy: Oh, I know. I think it will go nicely with what I have prepared for dinner.\\
87 - Sheldon: Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!\\
88 - Amy: Just like your mommy used to make.\\
89 - Sheldon: Oh yummy, yummy! We should do this more often. Uh-oh.\\
90 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
91 - Leonard: I’m sorry. I did, I crossed a line. I didn’t mean to!\\
92 - Penny: Who says something like that right in the middle of s*x?\\
93 - Leonard: I don’t know, it just came out. People say weird things during s*x all the time.\\
94 - Penny: Okay, well, they sure as hell don’t say that.\\
95 - Leonard: It was the heat of the moment.\\
96 - Penny: No, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just like that, not will you marry me?\\
97 - Leonard: I’m sorry. Just, just give me another chance.\\
98 - Penny: Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go, hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools?\\
99 - Leonard: Again, I’m sorry. You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married, I got caught up in a little wedding fever. I take it back.\\
100 - Penny: You can’t take something like that back. I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?\\
101 - Leonard: Okay, at some point, we’ll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don’t we just start doing that now?\\
102 - Penny: You’re kidding.\\
103 - Leonard: No. Hey, do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all, like, what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny.\\
104 - Penny: It’s not funny.\\
105 - Leonard: Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go.\\
106 - Scene: Howard’s bedroom.\\
107 - Howard: Hey, I was thinking. For our first dance at the wedding, what if we learn the final number from Dirty Dancing?\\
108 - Bernadette: You’re kidding.\\
109 - Howard: No, come on. How cool would that be? Me running into your arms, you lifting me up into the air.\\
110 - Bernadette: Oh, you’re in a good mood.\\
111 - Howard: Yeah, well, why wouldn’t I be? You know, I’m marrying the girl of my dreams, and I finally got my mother to agree not to come on our honeymoon. (Phone rings) Oh, hang on. Oh, it’s NASA. Wolowitz. Oh! Hi, Dave. What’s up? No kidding. Really? Well, that’s great news. Great, great news. All right, I’ll watch my e-mail for the details. Okay, talk soon.\\
112 - Bernadette: What’s so great?\\
113 - Howard: It looks like I’m going into space after all.\\
114 - Bernadette: Oh, Howie, that’s wonderful!\\
115 - Howard: Uh-huh, wonderful. Yay.\\
116 - Bernadette: What happened? I thought they cancelled your mission.\\
117 - Howard: Th-They did. But NASA really wants my telescope up on the space station, so they’re putting me on an earlier launch.\\
118 - Bernadette: When?\\
119 - Howard: A week from Friday.\\
120 - Bernadette: What? We’re getting married that Sunday.\\
121 - Howard: You’re right. I, I can’t go to space. I have to get married, and no one can say that’s not a good reason. I’ll call him back.\\
122 - Bernadette: Wait. I don’t want to be the one who stands in your way.\\
123 - Howard: Well, too bad, you already did. It’s a done deal. Oh, well. But I forgive you.\\
124 - Bernadette: No. That’s not how I want to start our marriage, killing your dream. We’ll have the wedding when you get back.\\
125 - Howard: But what about all the plans and the guests?\\
126 - Bernadette: We’ll call them. Although my dad’s gonna go a little nutso over losing his deposits.\\
127 - Howard: You’re right, he is! Your dad’s gonna be furious. There’s no way he’s gonna let us postpone this wedding. Well, we tried.\\
128 - Bernadette: I’ll talk to him. He won’t say no to his little girl.\\
129 - Howard: No. I, uh, I should talk to him, man to man.\\
130 - Bernadette: But, Howie, my dad can be a bully. He’s gonna make you cancel your space flight.\\
131 - Howard: We can only hope… that he doesn’t.\\
132 - Scene: The apartment. Sheldon and Leonard are playing three dimensional chess.\\
133 - Sheldon: Bishop to queen four, level two. Check.\\
134 - Leonard: Sheldon, knight takes bishop. You all right?\\
135 - Sheldon: I’m fine.\\
136 - Leonard: Are you? You left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?\\
137 - Sheldon: Very well. Can I ask you a question about women?\\
138 - Leonard: We got you that book last year. Wasn’t everything in there?\\
139 - Sheldon: No, I’m having a relationship problem with Amy. And by the way, that book gave me nightmares.\\
140 - Leonard: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I screwed things up pretty good with Penny.\\
141 - Sheldon: Look at us, Leonard, engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol’ ladies.\\
142 - Leonard: I guess we are. So, what’s going on?\\
143 - Sheldon: Believe it or not, Amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy.\\
144 - Leonard: I’m sorry, that must be very difficult for you.\\
145 - Sheldon: It’s awful. This morning, she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day. It, it’s usually only open to children. She got them to make an exception.\\
146 - Leonard: Shame on her.\\
147 - Sheldon: They let me blow the whistle, Leonard.\\
148 - Leonard: She’s good.\\
149 - Sheldon: I know. And it gets worse. Her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times.\\
150 - Leonard: You mean, like in bed or in the shower?\\
151 - Sheldon: No! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book? For example, this morning, I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy’s dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders. Oh, what has that vixen done to me, Leonard? And how do I make it stop?\\
152 - Leonard: Well, if you had a physical relationship, I’d say propose during s*x. Turns out that’s a real mood killer.\\
153 - Sheldon: I assume we’re talking about you now?\\
154 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
155 - Sheldon: So, that’s how this works? I complain, and then you complain, and no one offers any solutions?\\
156 - Leonard: Pretty much.\\
157 - Sheldon: Well, no wonder the women are winning.\\
158 - Scene: Bernadette’s father’s house.\\
159 - Howard: Mr. Rostenkowski, are you busy?\\
160 - Mr. Rostenkowski: I’m just looking at some old pictures. Come on in.\\
161 - Howard: Family pictures, or… holy crap, that’s a dead person.\\
162 - Mr. Rostenkowski: Last murder case before I retired. How many bodies do you see there? Careful, it’s a trick question.\\
163 - Howard: I’m not sure.\\
164 - Mr. Rostenkowski: Nah, you’ll never get it. It’s a fraction.\\
165 - Howard: How about that. Anyway, sir, I need to talk to you about something.\\
166 - Mr. Rostenkowski: Walnut?\\
167 - Howard: No, thank you. I’m allergic.\\
168 - Mr. Rostenkowski: Oh, sure. My partner used to have that. He’s dead now.\\
169 - Howard: From nuts?\\
170 - Mr. Rostenkowski: Nah, his wife shot him. But she was nuts, so in a way.\\
171 - Howard: Nice story. Anyway, the reason I wanted to talk to you is NASA has moved up my launch to the International Space Station.\\
172 - Mr. Rostenkowski: Yeah, so?\\
173 - Howard: So, the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter. Now, I know what you’re going to say, I made a commitment to Bernadette and to your family and I’ve got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing. Well, message heard and understood. Mission cancelled. Thank you.\\
174 - Mr. Rostenkowski: Where are you going?\\
175 - Howard: I’m sorry. May I be excused?\\
176 - Mr. Rostenkowski: No, you may not. Let me tell you something. When I first met you… You just gonna stand there?\\
177 - Howard: I’m sorry, I didn’t know, is this going to… Well, I should sit… May I be seat… Well, I’ll just sit.\\
178 - Mr. Rostenkowski: When I first met you, I didn’t like you.\\
179 - Howard: I’m aware of that, sir.\\
180 - Mr. Rostenkowski: But then you and I had some time together.\\
181 - Howard: Uh-huh.\\
182 - Mr. Rostenkowski: It did not get better.\\
183 - Howard: Right, right.\\
184 - Mr. Rostenkowski: That silly Beatle haircut and you riding around on a red Vespa, and you still living at home with your mother. To be honest, I thought Bernadette chose you to punish me. But then I heard about your astronaut thing, and I realized I judged you too fast. Maybe you are the right guy for my little girl.\\
185 - Howard: Oh, I am. And just so you know, I’d still be an astronaut, even if I didn’t go to space. I’ve got an I.D. Card and a NASA golf shirt.\\
186 - Mr. Rostenkowski: No, no, you got to go. You can’t turn down an opportunity like this.\\
187 - Howard: But what about the wedding and all the money you put down for the reception?\\
188 - Mr. Rostenkowski: You let me worry about that. You go up to that space station, and you make me proud.\\
189 - Howard: Um, okay.\\
190 - Mr. Rostenkowski: You got a problem with that?\\
191 - Howard: All right, look, I’m gonna level with you. I’m terrified about going into space. What if I don’t make it back?\\
192 - Mr. Rostenkowski: It’s gonna be okay, son.\\
193 - Howard: You really think so?\\
194 - Mr. Rostenkowski: Of course. A pretty girl like Bernadette, she’ll find a new guy.\\
195 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
196 - Penny: Hey.\\
197 - Leonard: Hey. Off to work?\\
198 - Penny: Yeah.\\
199 - Leonard: Have a nice night.\\
200 - Penny: Okay, you, too.\\
201 - Leonard: Penny, just, wait. I’ve been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night.\\
202 - Penny: Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it, too.\\
203 - Leonard: I noticed you never answered me.\\
204 - Penny: You’re right. (Kisses him) No.\\
205 - Leonard: Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?\\
206 - Penny: Yep.\\
207 - Leonard: Is it still weird ’cause I proposed?\\
208 - Penny: Yep.\\
209 - Leonard: I have a couple more quick questions. Do you want to call me from the car?\\
210 - Penny: No!\\
211 - Leonard: I played that pretty well. (Enters apartment. Amy, dressed as a Vulcan starfleet officer, is examining Sheldon.)\\
212 - Amy: Hello, Leonard.\\
213 - Leonard: What are you doing?\\
214 - Amy: We’re playing doctor. Star Trek style.\\
215 - Sheldon: I’m in hell, Leonard. Don’t stop.
\subsection {Episode 24: The Countdown Reflection}
1 - Following a “Previously on The Big Bang Theory” section\\
2 - Scene: A Soyuz Spaceship capsule.\\
3 - Mission Control (in Russian): Launch step twelve reading okay.\\
4 - Cosmonaut (in Russian): Launch step twelve acknowledged.\\
5 - Howard: Hey Mike?\\
6 - Mike Massimino: Yeah.\\
7 - Howard: I changed my mind. I don’t want to do this.\\
8 - Mike: Good one.\\
9 - Howard: Yeah, I’m a funny guy. I also have a hysterical bit planned for later where I pretend to cry through the whole launch.\\
10 - Scene: The apartment.\\
11 - Leonard: Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?\\
12 - Sheldon: 289, right between the Game Show Network at 288 and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290.\\
13 - Amy: I love his eidetic memory, it’s so sexy. Sheldon, what are the ingredients in Pringles?\\
14 - Sheldon: Dried potatoes, vegetable oil, corn flower, wheat starch, maltodextrin, salt, and my favourite ingredient of all, uniformity.\\
15 - Amy: The uterus quivers, does it not?\\
16 - Leonard: There’s Howard’s rocket, live from Kazakhstan.\\
17 - Bernadette: Oh, God, I’m so nervous. I don’t think I can watch.\\
18 - Raj: You’re nervous? I’ve been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I’m wearing my fat pants.\\
19 - Sheldon: Remarkable. In just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard’s keister. And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been Tetris and mail-order brides.\\
20 - Bernadette: Give me those damn Pringles.\\
21 - Scene: Soyuz capsule.\\
22 - Cosmonaut (in Russian): Are all of the systems of the ship ready?\\
23 - Mission Control: Da.\\
24 - Mike: Okay, we’re in the final countdown. How you doing over there?\\
25 - Howard: Good! Good! Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing. How much urine do these suits hold?\\
26 - Credits sequence.\\
27 - Scene: Soyuz capsule.\\
28 - Mike: Hey, Froot Loops, want to hit your fan switch?\\
29 - Howard: Check.\\
30 - Cosmonaut: He calls you Froot Loops because of your very gay haircut?\\
31 - Howard: No, it’s ’cause I live with my mom and she makes me Froot Loops.\\
32 - Cosmonaut: Go with gay story, people are more accepting of that.\\
33 - Mike: Actually, Froot Loops just got married to a girl.\\
34 - Cosmonaut: Congratulations.\\
35 - Howard: Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch.\\
36 - Cosmonaut: You and Mrs. Loops have a big wedding?\\
37 - Howard: Not exactly. Listen, if you don’t mind, I’m not really up for chatting. I’m just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes. That went really quick. Let me try it again.\\
38 - Scene: Howard’s bedroom.\\
39 - Howard: Close your eyes. Put out your hand. I got you something special.\\
40 - Bernadette: Come on, Howard. I’m not falling for that again.\\
41 - Howard: No, here.\\
42 - Bernadette: Oh, Howie. A little star, it’s beautiful. Put it on me.\\
43 - Howard: Okay, but I’m going to have to get it back from you so I can take it to the International Space Station. That way, when I come home, you will have a star that was actually in space.\\
44 - Bernadette: Oh, my God.\\
45 - Howard: Take that, every guy who’s ever bought you anything.\\
46 - Bernadette: This is the most amazing gift I’ve ever gotten.\\
47 - Howard: Really? Well, if you like it that much, then close your eyes and put out your hand.\\
48 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): ‘m going to the supermarket to buy snacks for your trip. Do you want me to get those little boxes of Froot Loops you like?\\
49 - Howard: No! When I eat Froot Loops, the other astronauts make fun of me!\\
50 - Bernadette: Howard, I don’t want to wait until you’re back to get married.\\
51 - Howard: What?\\
52 - Bernadette: I want to be married to you before you get in that rocket.\\
53 - Howard: But I’m leaving in two days.\\
54 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): What about Apple Jacks?\\
55 - Howard: I don’t need to take cereal.\\
56 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): What kind of breakfast do you think they’re going to give you in Russia?\\
57 - Howard: They invented blintzes. I’ll be fine.\\
58 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): They invented the lightbulb in New Jersey. It doesn’t mean they hand them out to you when you go.\\
59 - Bernadette: We’ll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends, and we’ll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back.\\
60 - Howard: Wow. Okay. Let’s get married.\\
61 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): You know what, I’ll buy you All-Bran in case you get stopped up in outer space.\\
62 - Scene: The apartment.\\
63 - Bernadette: So anyway, we decided to go down to City Hall this afternoon get married, and then have the reception when Howard gets back.\\
64 - Leonard: That’s so great. (Others also make encouraging sounds)\\
65 - Howard: I mean, we know it’s short notice, but we’d love you all to come with us.\\
66 - Amy: No, no, no, this is not the wedding I wanted! I want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays The Way You Look Tonight.\\
67 - Bernadette: That wasn’t going to be our processional music.\\
68 - Amy: Well, it was going to be mine.\\
69 - Sheldon: Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline because it doesn’t sound like something I’ll enjoy.\\
70 - Leonard: Come on, Sheldon, it’ll be fun.\\
71 - Sheldon: That’s what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.\\
72 - Bernadette: So, what do you say, Amy?\\
73 - Amy: Can I wear my maid of honour dress?\\
74 - Bernadette: Seriously? You’re going to wear that thing to City Hall?\\
75 - Amy: It’s all I have left. You’re going to take that from me, too?\\
76 - Scene: City Hall.\\
77 - Penny: Amy, you look great.\\
78 - Amy: I know.\\
79 - Leonard: Where’d you get a beer?\\
80 - Raj: From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. Beautiful story, they’re in rival drug gangs, and they’re getting married. Shh, no one can know.\\
81 - Amy: Look at all these people in love. It kind of gets you thinking, doesn’t it?\\
82 - Sheldon: It does, indeed. Leonard, is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her?\\
83 - Howard: You proposed to Penny?\\
84 - Leonard: I don’t want to talk about it.\\
85 - Raj: Where did he pop the question? What did you say?\\
86 - Leonard: She said no, can we drop it now?\\
87 - Penny: It wasn’t a real proposal.\\
88 - Bernadette: Why wasn’t it a real proposal?\\
89 - Sheldon: He asked her during coitus.\\
90 - Howard: Did you get down on one knee or were you already there?\\
91 - Bernadette: Howard, don’t talk like that on your wedding day.\\
92 - Howard: I’m sorry, Ma… Bernadette. Ma… Burna… You’re ma Bernadette.\\
93 - Penny: Good move telling Sheldon.\\
94 - Leonard: What, I can’t propose? I can’t talk to my friends? Is there anything else I’m not allowed to do?\\
95 - Amy: All right, that’s enough. Today is not about you two. Today is about Howard and Bernadette and me.\\
96 - Registrar: Folks, can I have your attention. It’s five o’clock, we’re going to be able to take three more couples. The rest of you will have to come back on Monday.\\
97 - Bernadette: Oh, no.\\
98 - Howard: I got this. Excuse me, but is there any way you could squeeze us in? See, I’m an astronaut and I’m leaving for Russia on Sunday so I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.\\
99 - Registrar: Yeah, me, too. I’ll see you there.\\
100 - Bernadette: I can’t believe we’re not going to get married.\\
101 - Amy: Excuse me, I’m going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour.\\
102 - Scene: Soyuz capsule.\\
103 - Cosmonaut: So, I tell my wife, get a dog, don’t get a dog, I’m not walking it, I’m not feeding it, I’m not picking up after it.\\
104 - Mike: You know you’re going to wind up walking it.\\
105 - Cosmonaut: I know.\\
106 - Howard: Uh, shouldn’t you guys be talking about space stuff instead of dogs?\\
107 - Mike: Dimitri, Froot Loops would be more comfortable if we talked about space stuff.\\
108 - Dimitri: Okay, I’m going into space, and when I come back, I have to pick up a poodle crap.\\
109 - Mike: Is that better?\\
110 - Howard: Thanks.\\
111 - Scene: The Cheesecake Factory bar.\\
112 - Howard: You know, we could always drive to Vegas and get married.\\
113 - Bernadette: No, isn’t that kind of tacky?\\
114 - Penny: Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas.\\
115 - Bernadette: Are any of them still married?\\
116 - Penny: Yeah, I mean, not to the same people but…\\
117 - Bernadette: There’s got to be some place special we could do it.\\
118 - Sheldon: Leonard, where did you envision marrying Penny?\\
119 - Leonard: Will you shut up?\\
120 - Raj: Well, I know how to make it special.\\
121 - Howard: I told you we are not recreating the wedding from The Sound of Music.\\
122 - Raj: Yes, you made that brutally clear to me. What I was going to suggest is if that you’re willing to wait until Sunday morning, the Google satellite will be over Pasadena. You can have a wedding photograph from space.\\
123 - All: Oh!\\
124 - Leonard: That’s so cool.\\
125 - Howard: Oh, wait to go, Raj.\\
126 - Raj: I keep telling you, if I wasn’t an astrophysicist, I would have been a party planner. It was always a coin flip.\\
127 - Howard: Okay, so we know we’re going to do it Sunday morning. Now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us.\\
128 - Leonard: How about our roof?\\
129 - Bernadette: Oh, I like that.\\
130 - Howard: That’s great.\\
131 - Amy: Oh, my gosh. I can’t believe my maid of honour dress is going to be on Google Earth.\\
132 - Howard: So, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who’s going to do the ceremony.\\
133 - Penny: Well, that’s easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. I know a piercing parlour where, for a hundred bucks they’ll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want.\\
134 - Bernadette: Great, well, who’s it going to be?\\
135 - Sheldon: I’ll do it, provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon.\\
136 - Bernadette: No.\\
137 - Sheldon: What do you see in her?\\
138 - Scene: Soyuz capsule.\\
139 - Dimitri (in Russian): Mission Control, say again, how fast is it leaking?\\
140 - Howard: Leaking? What’s leaking?\\
141 - Dimitri: Fuel. Shh.\\
142 - Mission Control (in Russian): Not bad. We feel okay to go.\\
143 - Dimitri (in Russian): Okay, thanks Mission Control.\\
144 - Howard: There’s fuel leaking and we’re still going to go?\\
145 - Mike: Don’t lose your Froot Loops, Froot Loops.\\
146 - Dimitri: This happens a lot. Nine times out of ten, no problem.\\
147 - Howard: What happens on the tenth time?\\
148 - Dimitri: Problem.\\
149 - Scene: The apartment.\\
150 - Howard: Hey, guys, before I forget, I got you a little groomsman present.\\
151 - Raj: Oh, thanks, man.\\
152 - Sheldon: You didn’t have to do that.\\
153 - Howard: Fantastic Four, annual number three from 1965, in mint condition. The one where Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl get married.\\
154 - Leonard: Oh, wow.\\
155 - Sheldon: Oh, dear. I was afraid of this.\\
156 - Howard: What?\\
157 - Sheldon: While a thoughtful gift, this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars.\\
158 - Howard: Yeah, so?\\
159 - Sheldon: I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. Which places me in your debt and I can’t be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move, or to kill a man.\\
160 - Leonard: I doubt he’ll ask you to kill a man.\\
161 - Sheldon: Well, what if it’s his only way out? I can’t risk it. Here is twelve dollars. Now, we’re even. Wait, wait, wait, I bought a card. Give me two dollars. And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving.\\
162 - Scene: Penny’s door. Howard knocks.\\
163 - Amy: Who is it?\\
164 - Howard: It’s the groom.\\
165 - Amy: Can’t come in. Bad luck to see the bride.\\
166 - Howard: Okay, uh, fine. Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother. I’ll be right back.\\
167 - Bernadette (off): Why can’t she drive herself?\\
168 - Howard: She doesn’t want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so I’m going to lay her down in the back of my neighbour’s van.\\
169 - Bernadette (off): All right, just hurry!\\
170 - Howard: Okay, I’ll see you later, Ma… uh… lovely bride-to-be. I really got to watch that.\\
171 - Scene: The roof.\\
172 - Leonard: Come on, Raj, we’re ready to start.\\
173 - Raj: What, we’re ready when I say we’re ready. Uh-du-du-du, ooh, okay, now we’re ready.\\
174 - Howard: Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?\\
175 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): I’m fine where I am. I don’t want to fall off the roof.\\
176 - Howard: You’ll fall through the roof before you fall off it.\\
177 - Raj: Penny. (She starts music playing) \\
178 - Mr Rostenkowski: Your new mother-in-law’s a piece of work.\\
179 - Bernadette: Not now, Dad.\\
180 - Mr Rostenkowski: She’s got a bigger mustache than me. Here you go.\\
181 - Bernadette: Here you go? What am I, a football?\\
182 - Mr Rostenkowski: Like that guy could catch a football.\\
183 - Raj: Howard and Bernadette, the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers.\\
184 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Louder!\\
185 - Bernadette: They all got ordained, they’re all marrying us, it’s adorable, if you want to hear come closer.\\
186 - Raj: Guys, when I look at the two of you starting your lives together, it fills my heart, It fills my, heart, okay, I’m going to need a minute.\\
187 - Penny: Okay, I’ll, I’ll go. Howard and Bernadette, I know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding, but when you’re in love, it doesn’t matter where or how these things happen. It just matters that you have each other.\\
188 - Leonard: Hmm.\\
189 - Penny: Problem?\\
190 - Leonard: No.\\
191 - Sheldon: I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.\\
192 - Penny: Oh, grow up.\\
193 - Leonard: Hey, I didn’t say it.\\
194 - Amy: All right, that’s enough from the both of you.\\
195 - Penny: Well, he started it.\\
196 - Amy: Well, I’m ending it. Bernadette, I want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour. I also want you to know, that I will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out.\\
197 - Leonard: Thank you, Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that’s the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.\\
198 - Sheldon: Would you like some aloe vera? You just got burned. All right, my turn. Howard, Bernadette. (Begins speaking in Klingon)\\
199 - Bernadette: Sheldon! I told you no Klingon.\\
200 - Sheldon: Fine, I’ll do it in English, but it loses something. The need to find another human being to share one’s life with has always puzzled me. Maybe because I’m so interesting all by myself. With that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own. The Klingon would have made you cry.\\
201 - Raj: I believe you two have prepared vows?\\
202 - Bernadette: Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you, this is going to be short and sweet. I love you with all my heart and soul and promise to be with you forever.\\
203 - Howard: Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski.\\
204 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Speak up!\\
205 - Howard: Hey, from now on, she’s the only women who can yell at me! Until I met you, I couldn’t imagine spending my life with just one person. And now I can’t imagine spending one day of it without you.\\
206 - All: By the power vested in us, by the state of California…\\
207 - Sheldon: And the Klingon High Council…\\
208 - All: We now pronounce you husband and wife.\\
209 - Scene: Soyuz capsule.\\
210 - Mike: That’s ignition. I love this part.\\
211 - Dimitri: Me, too.\\
212 - Howard: I have strongly mixed feelings.\\
213 - Scene: The apartment.\\
214 - Bernadette: Oh, my God, it’s happening.\\
215 - Penny: Did I miss it?\\
216 - Leonard: No, come on in. Hurry.\\
217 - Bernadette: I love that man.\\
218 - Raj: Me, too.\\
219 - Penny: I can’t believe it. This whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying.\\
220 - Leonard: This is it.\\
221 - Sheldon: Boldly go, Howard Wolowitz.\\
222 - (Russian countdown ends, rocket takes off)\\
223 - Howard (voice off): Oy vay!

\subsection {Episode 01: The Date Night Variable}
1 - Following a “Previously on The Big Bang Theory” section\\
2 - Scene: The Comic Book Store.\\
3 - Stuart: So, Howard’s really in space, huh?\\
4 - Leonard: Mm-hmm, International Space Station. 250 miles that way.\\
5 - Raj: Right now, Howard’s staring down at our planet like a tiny Jewish Greek god. Zeusowitz.\\
6 - Sheldon: I must admit, I can’t help but feel a twinge of envy. He can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes. His dim, uncomprehending eyes. It’s like a cat in an airport carrying case.\\
7 - Leonard: You know, it’s not exactly glamorous up there. The water that the astronauts drink is made from each other’s recycled urine.\\
8 - Stuart: Must be nice. Nobody wants anything that comes out of me.\\
9 - Raj: I wonder what he’s doing right this very second.\\
10 - Leonard: Mm, conducting experiments in zero gravity.\\
11 - Raj: Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.\\
12 - Sheldon: Whatever it is, we know his life will never be the same.\\
13 - Scene: The International Space Station.\\
14 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard. Can you hear me?\\
15 - Howard: I can hear you without the phone,\\
16 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Don’t be snippy. I’m just excited to talk to my baby.\\
17 - Howard: I’m excited to talk to you, too.\\
18 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): So, what’s this mishegas about you moving out to go live with the little Polish girl?\\
19 - Howard: How about calling her my wife?\\
20 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Wives don’t take boys from their mothers.\\
21 - Howard: They do. That’s why we marry them.\\
22 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): I just hope I’m not dead from a broken heart before you get back.\\
23 - Howard: Ma, please. Everyone from NASA is listening to this phone call.\\
24 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Good. They should know what a horrible son you are.\\
25 - Howard: Okay, Ma, great talking to you. Gotta go. Well, space is ruined.\\
26 - Credits sequence.\\
27 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. Penny is bleaching Amy’s upper lip.\\
28 - Amy: This is so exciting. Soon, my upper lip will be the same fake blonde as my beautiful best friend.\\
29 - Penny: Hey, this is my natural hair colour. Now. So, does Sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?\\
30 - Amy: Oh, yes. According to the Relationship Agreement, on the anniversary of our first date, he must take me to a nice dinner, ask about my day and engage in casual physical contact that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy.\\
31 - Penny: That’s hot. You kids better use protection.\\
32 - Amy: How long does this stay on?\\
33 - Penny: Just a couple of minutes. You’ve really never done this before?\\
34 - Amy: Once in high school, but I dozed off and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face.\\
35 - Penny: Oh, my gosh, that’s awful. The other kids make fun of you?\\
36 - Amy: No, I had a cover story, I told everyone it was herpes. So, how’s everything going with you and Leonard?\\
37 - Penny: Uh, I don’t know, it’s still kind of weird. We haven’t really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of s*x.\\
38 - Amy: Oh, boo-hoo. If Sheldon proposed to me during s*x, my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go.\\
39 - Scene: The university cafeteria.\\
40 - Sheldon: Leonard, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?\\
41 - Leonard: Interesting question. On the one hand, I always thought…\\
42 - Sheldon: You don’t even know what it is, do you? The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does, the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question. As I am doing so eloquently right now.\\
43 - Leonard: I know what the anthropic principle is.\\
44 - Sheldon: Of course. I just explained it to you. Now, where do you stand on it?\\
45 - Leonard: Where do you stand on it?\\
46 - Sheldon: Strongly pro.\\
47 - Leonard: Then I believe that God created the world in six days, and on the seventh he made you to annoy me.\\
48 - Raj: Hey, guys.\\
49 - Leonard: Hey.\\
50 - Sheldon: Yeah, wait, Raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?\\
51 - Raj: I’m all for it.\\
52 - Sheldon: Attaboy!\\
53 - Leonard: Well, hang on. Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I don’t?\\
54 - Sheldon: Oh, Leonard. Let’s not take a saw to the branch we’re sitting on, shall we?\\
55 - Raj: Hey, uh, if you guys are free tonight, I heard about a spa where you soak your feet n a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them. I don’t need to tell you in Los Angeles, sandal season is year round.\\
56 - Leonard: Actually, I’m hanging out with Penny.\\
57 - Raj: Oh, okay. Sounds like it’s me and you, Sheldon. How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?\\
58 - Sheldon: As I’ve stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken, because the last words I would hear are “Release the Kraken.” That never gets old. “Release the Kraken!” Oh, chills. Besides, I’m having dinner with Amy.\\
59 - Raj: Oh, okay. I’ll just go home and be alone. Which is cool. I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so, cool.\\
60 - Sheldon: Darn. If you weren’t busy, I’d ask you to join us.\\
61 - Raj: Really? I can come? Thanks.\\
62 - Leonard: Sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy?\\
63 - Sheldon: Oh, absolutely. I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation and casual physical contact, but nowhere is it specified that I can’t outsource that to an Indian.\\
64 - Scene: The International Space Station\\
65 - Bernadette (on webcam): Howie? Howie?\\
66 - Howard: Hey, there’s my beautiful bride. Can you see me?\\
67 - Bernadette: I can. How are you?\\
68 - Howard: I’m amazing. I mean, this is even better than I dreamed. I look out the window, and it’s all so unbelievable.\\
69 - Bernadette: Good for you. I just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom.\\
70 - Howard: Oh, yeah? That’s nice.\\
71 - Bernadette: It was. Until I found out you never told her we’re not gonna live with her. Let’s talk about that for a minute.\\
72 - Howard: Hey, look, this pen is floating. How crazy is that?\\
73 - Bernadette: You said you told her, but you never did!\\
74 - Howard: Okay, okay, I know you’re upset, but let me share something I’ve learned since I got here. You realize how small your problems are when you’re looking down on them from space. Now, come on, that’s got to make you feel better.\\
75 - Bernadette: How clear is the image of me on that screen?\\
76 - Howard: Pretty clear.\\
77 - Bernadette: Do I look like I feel better?\\
78 - Howard: I mean, it’s not, like, HD quality.\\
79 - Bernadette: Listen, mister, you’re gonna talk to your mother and you’re gonna fix this, or that thing I said I was gonna do to you the minute you got home, you can do to yourself.\\
80 - Dimitri: Like he’s been doing since he got here.\\
81 - Scene: A restaurant.\\
82 - Amy: Sheldon, this place is so romantic.\\
83 - Sheldon: Oh, I’m glad you like it. Raj picked it out.\\
84 - Amy: Well, when you see him, tell him I say thank you.\\
85 - Sheldon: Tell him yourself.\\
86 - Raj: Yoo-hoo! Over here!\\
87 - Amy: I don’t understand. What’s he doing here?\\
88 - Sheldon: I invited him.\\
89 - Amy: On our date? Sheldon, that’s not okay.\\
90 - Sheldon: Yes, it is. There’s a loophole in the Relationship Agreement.\\
91 - Amy: You found a loophole?\\
92 - Raj: Sorry I started without you. I’m a little nervous. It’s been a long time since I’ve been on a date.\\
93 - Amy: I can’t believe I bleached my moustache for this.\\
94 - Raj: You should go to my girl. She’ll knock out those sideburns for free.\\
95 - Later.\\
96 - Raj: You know, Amy, I don’t even think you and I have had a real conversation. Let’s use tonight to get to know each other a little better. You start.\\
97 - Amy: Go home.\\
98 - Raj: I don’t understand.\\
99 - Amy: Sheldon, how could you do this? It’s our second anniversary.\\
100 - Raj: It’s your anniversary? Oh, my God, I had no idea. Amy, please, let me make this right.\\
101 - Amy: Thank you.\\
102 - Raj: My pleasure. Waiter? A bottle of champagne and three glasses. Oh, boy, isn’t this romantic?\\
103 - Sheldon: Oh, I hope that’s a rhetorical question, because I have no clue.\\
104 - Scene: The apartment. \\
105 - Penny: This is great. What’s the occasion?\\
106 - Leonard: No occasion. You know, things have been a little weird between us, so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you.\\
107 - Penny: That is so sweet.\\
108 - Leonard: I got all your favourites. Beer, wings, sliders. We can watch the football game. I even painted my stomach.\\
109 - Penny: Go Sports?\\
110 - Leonard: Well, in case you were in the mood for baseball, I didn’t want to look ridiculous.\\
111 - Penny: This is awesome. I love it!\\
112 - Leonard: Good, I’m glad.\\
113 - Penny: Gosh, I worked my ass off today. This is exactly what I needed.\\
114 - Leonard: Great. Just relax and enjoy. Tonight is all about you.\\
115 - Penny: Ah, thank you!\\
116 - Leonard: So, where exactly are we in this relationship?\\
117 - Penny: Oh, come on. I just told you I had a hard day.\\
118 - Leonard: You’re right, I’m sorry. Let’s watch the game.\\
119 - Penny: Great.\\
120 - Leonard: I just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets.\\
121 - Penny: Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?\\
122 - Leonard: Absolutely. You’re the girl, I’m the guy. Now, you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here.\\
123 - Penny: Thank you. (Knock on door)\\
124 - Leonard: Oh, I’ll get it. Go sports.\\
125 - Raj: Hello-lo-lo.\\
126 - Leonard: What are you doing here? I thought you were out with Sheldon and Amy.\\
127 - Raj: I was, but it’s their anniversary and I didn’t want to be a third wheel, so I figured I’d come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date.\\
128 - Leonard: Well, it’s not really a great time. Penny and I have some things we need to talk about.\\
129 - Penny: No, we don’t! Come on in!\\
130 - Raj: Sweet!\\
131 - Leonard: I can’t believe I shaved my stomach for this.\\
132 - Scene: The International Space Station\\
133 - Dimitri: Hey, Froot Loops. You got a phone call.\\
134 - Howard: Who is it?\\
135 - Dimitri: A woman who says she’s your mother but sounds like your father.\\
136 - Howard: Hey, Ma. You know, we could see each other if you turn on the computer.\\
137 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): I’m not going near that fakakta thing. I’ll catch a computer virus.\\
138 - Howard: You can’t catch a computer virus.\\
139 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, so now you’re an astronaut and a doctor?\\
140 - Howard: What do you want, Ma?\\
141 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Your wife says you have something important to tell me.\\
142 - Howard: Okay, here it is. Bernadette and I are starting a life together and…\\
143 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, God! You are gonna leave me.\\
144 - Howard: Ma…\\
145 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): It’s okay. Your father left me, you left me, I guess I’m just the kind of person people like to leave.\\
146 - Howard: It’s not definite. I’ll talk to Bernadette.\\
147 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Don’t bother. I’ll just go sit in a hole in the ground so I’m no trouble when I die.\\
148 - Howard: Stop it, Ma. I’m sure I can get Bernie to come around.\\
149 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): I knew it. I knew she was behind this. You listen to me, if you want to be a man you can’t let a woman tell you what to do.\\
150 - Howard: Okay, okay.\\
151 - Dimitri: Oy. I can’t believe these people won the Cold War.\\
152 - Howard: Now, can we please change the subject?\\
153 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Fine. Explain why you’ve been gone so long and I haven’t gotten a single letter. Not even a lousy postcard.\\
154 - Scene: The apartment.\\
155 - Raj: You know, I’m growing to like American football.\\
156 - Penny: Yeah, it’s fun, isn’t it?\\
157 - Raj: Well, it’s not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket, but hey, what is?\\
158 - Penny: All right, who’s ready for another beer?\\
159 - Leonard: I’m good.\\
160 - Raj: No, thank you.\\
161 - Penny: Girls.\\
162 - Raj: Oh, I’m having the nicest time. You guys are like family to me. You know that, right?\\
163 - Leonard: That’s great. Get out.\\
164 - Raj: What? Why?\\
165 - Leonard: Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about.\\
166 - Raj: Oh pish on your issues. You guys are fine. Yes, you hit some bumps along the way. I mean, Penny, you’ve always known how this man has felt about you, but you made him grovel for affection.\\
167 - Penny: Okay, hold on…\\
168 - Raj: Now, don’t blame yourself. He was a groveller from way back. But the point is, the two of you got past it. And, Leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of s*x? That was some weak tea, dude.\\
169 - Leonard: Some people might say it was romantic.\\
170 - Raj: Yeah, no. But yet, here you two are, still together. And that’s even after you and I had our crazy naked night.\\
171 - Leonard: Okay.\\
172 - Penny: That’s enough.\\
173 - Raj: I’m just saying that after everything you’ve been through, you get to look into each other’s eyes and say “I love you.” And that’s beautiful.\\
174 - Leonard: Actually, to this day, she’s never really said it.\\
175 - Raj: Oh, Penny. That’s ridiculous. You know you love him. You, you look him in the eyes and you say it.\\
176 - Penny: Raj.\\
177 - Raj: Oh come on, you know you want to say it. Say it. Say you love him. Say it!\\
178 - Scene: The hallway. Raj is ejected from the apartment.\\
179 - Raj: I really thought she would say it.\\
180 - Scene: The restaurant.\\
181 - Amy: Have I ever told you you’re like a sexy praying mantis?\\
182 - Sheldon: Every time you drink alcohol.\\
183 - Amy: You know what’s wonderful about the praying mantis? They devour their mate.\\
184 - Sheldon: Your point being?\\
185 - Amy: Dessert is served.\\
186 - Sheldon: I just had cobbler.\\
187 - Amy: You know what? I’m done with this.\\
188 - Sheldon: W-Where are you going?\\
189 - Amy: I’m leaving.\\
190 - Sheldon: You can’t leave. I need you.\\
191 - Amy: You do?\\
192 - Sheldon: Yes. You’re my ride.\\
193 - Amy: Sheldon, you either say something meaningful and from the heart, or you and I are done.\\
194 - Sheldon: All right. Please. Amy, when I look in your eyes and you’re looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal, because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time. I feel excited and, at the same time, terrified. The truth is, I don’t know what I feel, except I know what kind of man I want to be.\\
195 - Amy: Sheldon, that was beautiful.\\
196 - Sheldon: I should hope so. That’s from the first Spider-Man movie.\\
197 - Amy: I’ll take it.\\
198 - Sheldon: Good. Now, I assume we’re splitting the cheque?\\
199 - Scene: The Comic Book Store.\\
200 - Raj: Hey, Stuart.\\
201 - Stuart: Oh, hey. I was actually just about to close up.\\
202 - Raj: Oh, I’m sorry. I’ll leave.\\
203 - Stuart: No, no. It’s okay. Hang out.\\
204 - Raj: You sure?\\
205 - Stuart: Yeah, you’re my first customer today.\\
206 - Raj: All right. Great.\\
207 - Stuart: I’m, uh, having a nightcap. You want to join me?\\
208 - Raj: What are you drinking?\\
209 - Stuart: Coffee liqueur in a Chewbacca mug. I call it a sad-tini.\\
210 - Raj: Perfect for the night I’m having. Thank you.\\
211 - Stuart: Hmm. Nice not to drink alone.\\
212 - Raj: Amen to that. Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay into my dog’s water bowl.\\
213 - Stuart: You’re kidding.\\
214 - Raj: She’s kind of a mean drunk, but what are you gonna do?\\
215 - Stuart: Cheers.\\
216 - Raj: Cheers.\\
217 - Stuart: A little music?\\
218 - Raj: Sure. Mmm. Bossa nova. You listen to that with your hips as well as your ears.\\
219 - Stuart: Mmm.\\
220 - Raj: Oh. Something about latin music just makes me feel like I’m on a white sand beach in Rio.\\
221 - Stuart: Yeah. The sun, the waves, the beautiful bodies, tanned and glistening with sweat.\\
222 - Raj: I should go.\\
223 - Stuart: Yeah.\\
224 - Raj: Uh, thank you for the drink.\\
225 - Stuart: No problem.\\
226 - Raj: Hey, Stuart.\\
227 - Stuart: Yeah?\\
228 - Raj: Do you want to hang out tomorrow night, maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?\\
229 - Stuart: Yeah, I-I’d like to, but I’m a little tight on funds.\\
230 - Raj: No problem. My treat. I’ll swing by after work.\\
231 - Stuart: Okay.\\
232 - Raj: Okay.\\
233 - Stuart: I could do worse.\\
234 - Scene: The International Space Station\\
235 - Bernadette: Aw, that’s such good news, Howie. Thank you for telling her.\\
236 - Howard: Hey, I’m a grown man. I’m gonna live with my wife. My mother’s just gonna have to learn to make do on her own.\\
237 - Bernadette: Was she upset?\\
238 - Howard: Who can tell? She yells everything. She might have been upset. She might have been hungry.\\
239 - Bernadette: Thanks for fixing it. I love you.\\
240 - Howard: I love you, too. Sweet dreams. I’ll talk to you tomorrow?\\
241 - Bernadette: Good night, Rocket Man.\\
242 - Howard: To infinity and beyond, baby.\\
243 - Dimitri: Loops. You realize you just lied your ass off to your wife and your mother.\\
244 - Howard: I know.\\
245 - Dimitri: What are you gonna do when you get back to Earth?\\
246 - Howard: Oh, I’m never going back.
\subsection {Episode 02: The Decoupling Fluctuation}
1 - Scene: Bernadette’s apartment.\\
2 - Bernadette: And the next wedding gift is a gravy boat.\\
3 - Penny: Ooh, one gravy boat.\\
4 - Amy: That’s from Sheldon. He told me he had it engraved.\\
5 - Bernadette: In the event of a divorce, please return to Sheldon Cooper.\\
6 - Penny: One inappropriate, yet I wish I thought of that gravy boat.\\
7 - Amy: When I get married I’m going to register at the UCLA Cadaver Lab.\\
8 - Penny: Ew, why?\\
9 - Amy: ‘Cause I’ve always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.\\
10 - Bernadette: So, you actually see you and Sheldon getting married someday?\\
11 - Amy: Not just someday. In exactly four years. But don’t tell Sheldon. He’s still a flight risk.\\
12 - Bernadette: What about you, Penny?\\
13 - Penny: What about me what?\\
14 - Bernadette: Do you think you and Leonard might ever get married?\\
15 - Penny: Oh, well, you know, Leonard is great.\\
16 - Bernadette: But do you think you’ll ever get married?\\
17 - Penny: He’s a sweetie.\\
18 - Amy: You’re not answering the question. Do you love him?\\
19 - Penny: Yeah, sure, of course I love him.\\
20 - Bernadette: It doesn’t sound like it.\\
21 - Penny: Well, I do.\\
22 - Bernadette: Do you tell him that?\\
23 - Penny: No, he’d just take it the wrong way.\\
24 - Amy: What does that mean?\\
25 - Penny: It means he is special and smart and nice and…\\
26 - Bernadette: Are you gonna break up with him?\\
27 - Penny: No. Maybe. I don’t know.\\
28 - Bernadette: I had no idea you were unhappy.\\
29 - Penny: That’s the thing, I’m not. I’m not unhappy at all. It’s just, I don’t know, I, I’ve been in love before, but it felt different. But maybe this is a new, better, boring kind of love. Do you ever feel that way about Howard?\\
30 - Bernadette: Oh, that’s not really a fair comparison. I’m basically married to a sexy Buzz Lightyear.\\
31 - Penny: Amy, you?\\
32 - Amy: Can’t help ya, kid. Whenever I’m around Sheldon, I feel like my loins are on fire. In the good way. Not the urinary tract infection way.\\
33 - Credits sequence.\\
34 - Scene: Cutting between the International Space Station and the apartment (the guys are on webcam).\\
35 - Raj (voice off): Hey, buddy, how’s it going up there?\\
36 - Howard: You don’t have to shout, Raj. It’s not like I’m an astronaut floating around in outer space. Oh, wait, I am.\\
37 - Leonard: So, is it everything you hoped it would be?\\
38 - Howard: It’s better. I wake up every morning and I just can’t believe I’m on this incredible adventure.\\
39 - Dimitri: Hey, Froot Loops, did you clean the space toilet?\\
40 - Howard: Excuse me. I’m talking to my friends.\\
41 - Mike: You know the rules, new guy scrubs the toilet.\\
42 - Dimitri: If you do good job, next time we give you brush.\\
43 - Howard: Funny. We’re always giving each other a hard time up here. It’s kind of like being in a frat. You know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings.\\
44 - Sheldon: Okay, my turn. Let me talk to him.\\
45 - Leonard: Go ahead.\\
46 - Sheldon: 2311 North Los Robles Avenue, Pasadena, California to International Space Station. Can you read me? Over. (Makes static noise)\\
47 - Howard: Yes, I read you, Sheldon.\\
48 - Sheldon: Copy that. Over. (Static noise)\\
49 - Leonard: What are you doing?\\
50 - Sheldon: I am talking to a man in space. If you don’t have the (static noise) then he might as well be at the Coffee Bean over on Lake Street.\\
51 - Howard: You’re out of your mind,Sheldon.\\
52 - Sheldon: That’s a negative. My mother had me tested. Over. (Static noise)\\
53 - Mike: Come on, scrub it up, Loops.\\
54 - Howard: All right, all right. I gotta go. There’s a meteor shower.\\
55 - Mike: You want to see a meteor shower? Take a look at what Dimitri just left you in the toilet.\\
56 - Howard: Bye.\\
57 - Sheldon: Over and out. (Static noise)\\
58 - Raj: Bye, buddy!\\
59 - Stuart (knocking and entering): Hello.\\
60 - Raj: Hey, Stuart, come on in.\\
61 - Sheldon: What are you doing here?\\
62 - Stuart: Um, Raj invited me to go to the movies with you guys.\\
63 - Sheldon: Excuse me. I didn’t authorize this.\\
64 - Leonard: Sheldon, you are not in charge.\\
65 - Sheldon: That’s mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.\\
66 - Raj: What’s the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didn’t want to sit by myself.\\
67 - Sheldon: The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. Now, we’re going to be a faceless mass of six.\\
68 - Leonard: It’ll be fine. Just, uh, pretend he’s Wolowitz.\\
69 - Sheldon: Hmm. Do you like Raisinets?\\
70 - Stuart: I can take them or leave them.\\
71 - Sheldon: At the movies, Wolowitz always eats Raisinets.\\
72 - Stuart: Would you feel more comfortable if I ate Raisinets?\\
73 - Sheldon: Well, it’s hardly my business what you eat, as long as it doesn’t crunch during the film and it’s Raisinets.\\
74 - Stuart: Okay. Should we go?\\
75 - Sheldon: Yuh-uh, one more question, if you’re going to replace Wolowitz, I need to know a little more about you.\\
76 - Stuart: All right.\\
77 - Sheldon: Wolowitz went to MIT. What’s your educational background?\\
78 - Stuart: I went to art school.\\
79 - Sheldon: Equally ridiculous. Let’s go.\\
80 - Scene: The cinema.\\
81 - Sheldon: This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.\\
82 - Amy: Well, I like it.\\
83 - Sheldon: Yeah, of course you do. You’re a girl. You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things.\\
84 - Amy: Just watch the movie.\\
85 - Sheldon: It’s not fair. Penny isn’t making Leonard hold hands.\\
86 - Amy: There might be a reason for that.\\
87 - Sheldon: Sweaty? Unhygienic? Looks dumb? Take your pick.\\
88 - Amy: Penny said she’s not sure she wants to be Leonard’s girlfriend anymore.\\
89 - Sheldon: Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.\\
90 - Amy: So?\\
91 - Sheldon: So, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witches’ brew of his soda and spit?\\
92 - Amy: It’s complicated.\\
93 - Sheldon: String theory is complicated. That’s just yucky. Don’t get any ideas. All right, for the sake of argument, let’s say that’s true. Why doesn’t Penny just end the relationship?\\
94 - Amy: She’s not sure how she feels.\\
95 - Sheldon: How can she not be sure how she feels? You know, when I have a feeling, I know it. Trains? Love them. Swordfish? I love them, too. They’re fish with a sword for a nose.\\
96 - Amy: Regardless, don’t say anything to Leonard.\\
97 - Sheldon: Now you’re asking me to keep a secret from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?\\
98 - Amy: Yes, please, Penny will kill me.\\
99 - Sheldon: Uh, fine. FYI, secret-keeping? Hate it. Hand-holding? Not a fan. Hammerhead shark? I love that thing. Yeah, it’s another fish with a tool on its head.\\
100 - Stuart: Raisinet?\\
101 - Sheldon: Shh, we’re trying to watch the movie. This is not working out with him.\\
102 - Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is making a sucking noise with his teeth.\\
103 - Leonard: What are you doing?\\
104 - Sheldon: I think I might have tartar buildup. My tongue won’t go as far forward as it used to.\\
105 - Leonard: Maybe your tongue is shrinking.\\
106 - Sheldon (measures): Nope. Oh, you have no idea how annoying this is.\\
107 - Leonard: I’m starting to get a sense of it. Don’t worry. I’ll take you to the dentist tomorrow.\\
108 - Sheldon: Thank you. I appreciate that. You’re good people, Leonard. There’s something I need to tell you.\\
109 - Leonard: Okay.\\
110 - Sheldon: I can’t tell you.\\
111 - Leonard: Why?\\
112 - Sheldon: I can’t tell you why I can’t tell you. So I guess there’s two things I can’t tell you.\\
113 - Leonard: I wish there were more.\\
114 - Sheldon: Good night. I’m sorry. This is really important.\\
115 - Leonard: What is it?\\
116 - Sheldon: I like The Transformers. Do you like The Transformers?\\
117 - Leonard: Where exactly did your mother have you tested?\\
118 - Sheldon: Leonard, the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. You know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to. Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room. I’m going to pause to let that sink in.\\
119 - Leonard: Okay, I think I understand.\\
120 - Sheldon: You do?\\
121 - Leonard: The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you, but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires.\\
122 - Sheldon: That is literally the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.\\
123 - Scene: Leonard’s room.\\
124 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?\\
125 - Leonard: What?\\
126 - Sheldon: Are you sleeping?\\
127 - Leonard: I was. Now I’m having a nightmare. What do you want?\\
128 - Sheldon: Never mind. I still can’t tell you.\\
129 - Scene: Penny’s bedroom. Sheldon is standing over Penny’s bed, knocking on the wall.\\
130 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Penny wakes up and screams. Sheldon also screams)\\
131 - Penny: Oh, my God. Sheldon?\\
132 - Sheldon: You frightened me.\\
133 - Penny: What are you doing in my bedroom?\\
134 - Sheldon: Yeah, well, I knocked on the front door, but you didn’t hear it.\\
135 - Penny: How did you even get in, you weirdo?\\
136 - Sheldon: Yeah, really? I’ve seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years, but when I do it, it’s weird?\\
137 - Penny: What do you want, Sheldon?\\
138 - Sheldon: Oh, I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought, uh, seeing as you’re up, we could talk.\\
139 - Penny: Talk about what?\\
140 - Sheldon: Oh, I don’t know, uh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with, why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend. Yeah, pick one, your choice.\\
141 - Penny: Sheldon.\\
142 - Sheldon: Did you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that? Hubba-hubba.\\
143 - Penny: Okay, go home, crazy man.\\
144 - Sheldon: Yeah. Did you know that while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country, in today’s North Korea, he’s downright average. Hey, talk about a keeper.\\
145 - Penny: Okay, what did Amy tell you?\\
146 - Sheldon: Oh, very well. I can’t keep up this clever charade any longer. She told me that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard.\\
147 - Penny: Okay, you listen to me. I think it’s really sweet you’re trying to protect your friend, but this is none of your business. Got it?\\
148 - Sheldon: Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend. I’m a big fan of homeostasis. Do you know what that is?\\
149 - Penny: Of course not.\\
150 - Sheldon: Homeostasis refers to a system’s ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH.\\
151 - Penny: Worst bedtime story ever.\\
152 - Sheldon: My point is I don’t like when things change. So, regardless of your feelings, I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also, while we’re on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. I’m not comfortable with the new scent. Please stop this madness and go back to green apple.\\
153 - Penny: Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out, and until I do, you are not to say a word to Leonard. Do you understand?\\
154 - Sheldon: I do. You clear on the shampoo issue?\\
155 - Penny: Get out.\\
156 - Sheldon: Penny?\\
157 - Penny: What?\\
158 - Sheldon: Please don’t hurt my friend.\\
159 - Penny: That is the last thing I want to do.\\
160 - Sheldon: Thank you. Coconut? What were you thinking? Are you a hula girl?\\
161 - Penny: Get out.\\
162 - Scene: Amy’s bedroom. Phone rings.\\
163 - Amy: Hello?\\
164 - Penny: What the hell is wrong with you? You told Sheldon? Do you know what a terrible position this puts me in? (Phone beeps)\\
165 - Amy: Hang on, please. Hello?\\
166 - Sheldon: Yeah, just a heads-up: Penny knows that you blabbed about Leonard. She’s pretty mad.\\
167 - Amy: I know. She’s yelling at me right now.\\
168 - Sheldon: All right then, so we’re all on the same page. Yes.\\
169 - Scene: Cutting between the International Space Station and the Bernadette’s apartment.\\
170 - Howard: Hey, Bernie.\\
171 - Bernadette: There’s my hubby. How’s everything going up there?\\
172 - Howard: Oh, it’s okay. Space is beautiful. Earth is beautiful. Same old, same old.\\
173 - Bernadette: What’s wrong?\\
174 - Howard: Nothing. Everything’s fine.\\
175 - Bernadette: Howard.\\
176 - Howard: The other astronauts are being mean to me.\\
177 - Bernadette: No, what are they doing?\\
178 - Howard: Well, like for instance, the other day when I was asleep, one of the guys went on a space walk and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window. When I woke up, I screamed for like nine minutes.\\
179 - Bernadette: Oh, Howie.\\
180 - Howard: You can see it if you want. It’s on YouTube. Google astronaut screams for nine minutes.\\
181 - Bernadette: Why don’t you stand up to them?\\
182 - Howard: What am I supposed to say?\\
183 - Bernadette: I don’t know. Say, being mean is lame, what’s cool is being nice.\\
184 - Howard: Great, I’ll do that when I want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie.\\
185 - Bernadette: Do you want me to call somebody at NASA?\\
186 - Howard: No. My mom already tried that. It only made things worse.\\
187 - Scene: The apartment. The guys are playing a card game.\\
188 - Leonard: Gelatinous Sphere.\\
189 - Raj: Focused Locust.\\
190 - Stuart: Temple of Yip.\\
191 - Sheldon: I’m sorry. Wolowitz would never play that card.\\
192 - Stuart: All right, Lesser Demon Turtle.\\
193 - Sheldon: Fairy God Monster, I win. Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak.\\
194 - Raj: So, what are you guys doing later? Stuart and I were thinking of going out for a drink.\\
195 - Stuart: We’re gonna try to meet some girls.\\
196 - Raj: ‘Cause that’s what we do.\\
197 - Stuart: Watch out, ladies, a little coffee and cream coming your way.\\
198 - Raj: In case you didn’t follow that, I’m the coffee.\\
199 - Sheldon: Leonard? Maybe you’d like to go with them to meet girls.\\
200 - Leonard: Why would I be interested? I have Penny.\\
201 - Sheldon: Yeah, for now. But that woman has a death wish, Leonard. She talks to strangers, she pets unfamiliar dogs, and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment. If I were you, I’d get a back-up.\\
202 - Leonard: You can’t just replace someone you care about with some other random person.\\
203 - Stuart: No, please don’t ruin this for me.\\
204 - Sheldon: Do you remember how upset I was when they replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk?\\
205 - Leonard: Yes, you walked around for a week saying, Sheldon unhappy with casting choice.\\
206 - Sheldon: But, then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers, and he was even better.\\
207 - Leonard: What’s your point?\\
208 - Sheldon: Call me a romantic. I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere.\\
209 - Leonard: This is ridiculous. Are we gonna play cards or not?\\
210 - Stuart: I like Mark Ruffalo, too.\\
211 - Sheldon: Yeah, settle down there, fake Wolowitz. No one likes a kiss-up.\\
212 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
213 - Leonard: So, I had to take Sheldon to the dentist this morning.\\
214 - Penny: Really?\\
215 - Leonard: Yup. I told him if he didn’t bite the hygienist, I’d take him for ice cream.\\
216 - Penny: Mmm.\\
217 - Leonard: I didn’t have to take him for ice cream.\\
218 - Penny: Uh-huh.\\
219 - Leonard: You okay? You seem a little distracted.\\
220 - Penny: Look, there’s something I need to tell you.\\
221 - Leonard: Oh. Yeah, okay.\\
222 - Penny: I don’t really know how to say this.\\
223 - Leonard: Just say it.\\
224 - Penny: Okay. Here goes.\\
225 - Leonard: Mm-hmm.\\
226 - Scene: Bernadette’s apartment.\\
227 - Amy: You slept with him?\\
228 - Penny: I didn’t know what else to do. He had those big, sad eyes.\\
229 - Bernadette: Oh, sure, you had no choice.\\
230 - Penny: He looked at me like this.\\
231 - Amy: Well, if that’s all it takes, it’s a good thing you don’t have a dog.\\
232 - Bernadette: Don’t worry. You’ll have plenty of chances to break up with him. Your wedding day, your honeymoon, your 50th anniversary.\\
233 - Penny: Look, it’s fine. We’re not getting married, okay? We’re keeping things, you know, homeostasis.\\
234 - Amy: It’s so cute when she tries.\\
235 - Penny (phone text tone): It’s from Leonard. Last night was amazing. You’re amazing. I’m so lucky to have you in my life. (They give him a hangdog look) Okay, stop it.\\
236 - Scene: Cutting between the International Space Station and the Bernadette’s apartment.\\
237 - Howard: Hey, Bernie, guess what? I stood up to the other astronauts like you said and I got to tell you, last night was the first time in a week I got a good night’s sleep. (On screen, Howard has a mouse face drawn on his face, and the words F.LOOPS on his forehead.)\\
238 - Bernadette: Oh, Howie.\\
239 - Howard: What’s wrong? You look upset.\\
240 - Bernadette: Nope, this is my proud face.
\subsection {Episode 03: The Higgs Boson Observation}
1 - Scene: Webcam conversation between Bernadette’s Office and the International Space Station\\
2 - Howard: Hey, Bernie.\\
3 - Bernadette: Hey, how’s my little astronautie hottie?\\
4 - Howard: Okay, I guess. It’s just, being cooped up in this tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me.\\
5 - Bernadette: Well, hang in there. You just have a couple more days to go, and then you’ll be home.\\
6 - Howard: I know.\\
7 - Bernadette: I got to get back to work. I love you.\\
8 - Howard: Love you too. Hey, Bernie? Before you go, can you do something for me?\\
9 - Bernadette: What do you want me to do?\\
10 - Howard: Okay, here it is. I really miss gravity. Can you drop something so I can watch it fall?\\
11 - Bernadette: Really, you’re serious? Okay. (Drops a pencil)\\
12 - Howard: Oh, baby, you’re killing me.\\
13 - Scene: The apartment. Penny enters, carrying a box.\\
14 - Penny: Ugh. Hey, Sheldon? Hi. This came for you today. It’s from your mom.\\
15 - Sheldon: Oh, thank you, Penny.\\
16 - Penny: M-hmm.\\
17 - Sheldon: Yeah, wait, here. For your troubles.\\
18 - Penny: Oh, boy, a whole dollar. Now, I can quit my paper route. So, what’s in it?\\
19 - Leonard: Mmm, doesn’t matter. Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box.\\
20 - Sheldon: Yeah, it’s journals and research papers I wrote as a child.\\
21 - Penny: Aw, how cute. Is this like a diary?\\
22 - Sheldon: No, that’s my potty training journal.\\
23 - Penny: Really, your potty training journal?\\
24 - Sheldon: Yeah. And forgive my crude penmanship. I didn’t start typing until I was six.\\
25 - Penny: August 7, 8:42 a.m. This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?\\
26 - Sheldon: There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, colour and consistency.\\
27 - Penny: Oh, disgusting.\\
28 - Leonard: No, what’s disgusting is he’s still keeping track.\\
29 - Penny: Why do you need all this stuff?\\
30 - Leonard: No, no, no, no.\\
31 - Penny: Sorry!\\
32 - Sheldon: I am glad you asked. Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?\\
33 - Penny: Of course, it is, it’s been in the news. And it’s a very famous boson.\\
34 - Sheldon: Nice try. Now, in 1964, Dr. Peter Higgs, accomplished self-promoter and physicist, he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson. Now, initially the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right, and now he’s on the fast track to win a Nobel prize.\\
35 - Penny: Yeah, that’s basically what I said.\\
36 - Sheldon: Yeah, the point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps I’ve already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize.\\
37 - Leonard: I didn’t know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.\\
38 - Penny: You really think there’s some kind of scientific discovery in here?\\
39 - Sheldon: Well, this box only covers my work through nursery school. There’s a good deal more to come. I didn’t really hit my academic stride until I cut out that time-suck known as playing outdoors.\\
40 - Leonard: So, you’re going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?\\
41 - Sheldon: That’s a good point. My time is much too valuable. You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me. You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labour.\\
42 - Leonard: Not gonna happen.\\
43 - Sheldon: Well, if I didn’t think you could handle it, I wouldn’t be asking.\\
44 - Leonard: If you want help, just hire a grad student.\\
45 - Penny: Maybe I could do it.\\
46 - Sheldon: You, really? You can assess the quality of my work? Okay, um, here. I wrote this when I was five years old.\\
47 - Penny: A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non self-contradictory set of abelion groups. I’m just a blonde monkey to you, aren’t I?\\
48 - Sheldon: You said it, not me.\\
49 - Credits sequence.\\
50 - Scene: Sheldon’s office.\\
51 - Sheldon: All right, Ms. Jenson. Uh, before we begin, may I offer you a refreshment? Water, coffee, tea, a marijuana cigarette?\\
52 - Ms Jenson: No, thanks. I’m fine.\\
53 - Sheldon: Now, are you sure? Everyone’s smoking them. I think they’re the best.\\
54 - Ms Jenson: I don’t do drugs.\\
55 - Sheldon: Excellent, yeah. That was a ruse. They’re not the best. Physics is the best. And by the way, coffee was also an unacceptable choice. All right, so I see here you’re from Des Moines, Iowa. Uh, you’re summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University. Oh, and two years ago, you had a persistent ear infection. I hope that didn’t cause any hearing loss.\\
56 - Ms Jenson: No, of course not. How did you know about that?\\
57 - Sheldon: I did a comprehensive background check. Medical records, credit reports, criminal history. (Hiding mouth behind book) I trust you paid off those parking tickets.\\
58 - Ms Jenson: Yes, I did.\\
59 - Sheldon: Hearing unimpaired, good.\\
60 - Ms Jenson: Look, Dr. Cooper, I really want this position. It would be an incredible honour to work for a man of your brilliance.\\
61 - Sheldon: Flattery will not get you this job, Ms. Jenson.\\
62 - Ms Jenson: It’s not flattery if it’s the truth.\\
63 - Sheldon: Oh, well, thank you. Welcome aboard.\\
64 - Scene: A University corridor.\\
65 - Leonard: You talk to Howard lately?\\
66 - Raj: Uh, yeah, last night. He kept making me drop pencils for him. I got uncomfortable. (Entering Sheldon’s office) Hey, Sheldon, hope you’re hungry, they’re serving macaroni and… (spots Ms Jenson) che-ee-ee-ese.\\
67 - Leonard: Smooth. Hi.\\
68 - Ms Jenson: Hello.\\
69 - Leonard: Sheldon, aren’t you going to introduce us?\\
70 - Sheldon: No. I have people for that now. You’re up.\\
71 - Ms Jenson: I’m Alex, Dr. Cooper’s new assistant.\\
72 - Leonard: Ah, congratulations and may God have mercy on your soul. I’m Leonard. This is Raj.\\
73 - Alex: It’s nice to meet you. I’m so excited to be working with Dr…\\
74 - Sheldon: Yeah, please reserve chitchat for your breaks, Ms. Jenson. FYI, there will be no breaks.\\
75 - Alex: I should probably get to work.\\
76 - Leonard: She seems nice.\\
77 - Raj: Hey, you already got a girlfriend. I call dibs.\\
78 - Leonard: All I said was she seems nice.\\
79 - Raj: Yeah, well, I love her.\\
80 - Scene: Webcam conversation between Bernadette’s Office and the International Space Station\\
81 - Bernadette: Hey, I wasn’t expecting to hear from you today. Everything okay?\\
82 - Howard: Uh, no, not really.\\
83 - Bernadette: What’s wrong?\\
84 - Howard: Well, remember the Soyuz capsule they were sending to bring us home?\\
85 - Bernadette: Uh-huh.\\
86 - Howard: It’s delayed. We’re gonna be here at least another week. Maybe ten days. It’s the Russians, so you don’t know. They left dogs up here in the sixties.\\
87 - Bernadette: Come on, Howard. No one’s leaving you up there.\\
88 - Howard: I don’t know how much longer I can take this. I can’t sleep, and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux. I’m down to my last three Tums.\\
89 - Bernadette: You’re going to be fine. You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom. And they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two. Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.\\
90 - Howard: Okay, okay. What am I doing? I’m using up all the oxygen. If I die, promise you’ll never have s*x with another man.\\
91 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. Amy is applying very red lip gloss.\\
92 - Amy: Oh, yeah. I’m a man-eater now.\\
93 - Penny: Okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler. You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed.\\
94 - Amy: Oh, I don’t know. Looks like something used by Tinkerbell’s gynecologist.\\
95 - Penny: Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook, so… who are you calling?\\
96 - Amy: I’m going to video-chat Sheldon. If my new look leads to phone s*x, I’m going to have to ask you to leave the room.\\
97 - Alex: Dr. Cooper’s office.\\
98 - Amy: Oh, hello. Who are you?\\
99 - Alex: I’m Alex, Dr. Cooper’s assistant. Can I help you?\\
100 - Amy: I’d like to speak to Sheldon.\\
101 - Alex: I’m sorry. He’s asked me to hold all calls unless you’re Stephen Hawking, his mother or himself from the future.\\
102 - Amy: All right. Well, tell him Amy called.\\
103 - Alex: Last name?\\
104 - Amy: He knows my last name. I’m his girlfriend. We have a contract and everything. I’ll send you a PDF.\\
105 - Alex: All right, I will tell him you called.\\
106 - Amy: Hmm, that’s weird.\\
107 - Penny: What?\\
108 - Amy: Sheldon told me he had a new assistant named Alex. He didn’t mention that Alex was a girl.\\
109 - Penny: Maybe he didn’t notice.\\
110 - Amy: You’re right. I don’t have to worry about Sheldon.\\
111 - Penny: No, you do not.\\
112 - Amy: It’s her I have to worry about.\\
113 - Penny: Oh, Amy, really? She is not going to come on to Sheldon.\\
114 - Amy: Oh, really? Look at this face (Sheldon’s picture on phone) How can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it?\\
115 - Penny: Well, for starters, at some point, that face starts talking.\\
116 - Scene: University corridor.\\
117 - Penny: Amy, this is crazy. You have nothing to be suspicious about.\\
118 - Amy: I’m not suspicious. I just want to stop in, say hi to my boyfriend and meet his new assistant. (Throwing open Sheldon’s office door) Aha!\\
119 - Penny: Can we go now?\\
120 - Amy: Hang on. (Rubs Sheldon’s telephone receiver under her armpit)\\
121 - Penny: What are you doing?\\
122 - Amy: Isn’t it obvious? I’m spreading my scent to mark my territory.\\
123 - Penny: Come on, Amy. That is not gonna work.\\
124 - Amy: Really? Because just before you became my best friend, I did this all over your apartment.\\
125 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
126 - Raj: Has your, uh, assistant said anything about me?\\
127 - Sheldon: Oh, in fact, she has. Uh, her exact words were, what is that guy’s problem?\\
128 - Raj: I’m in her head. Let the dance begin.\\
129 - Alex: Here’s your frozen yoghurt, Dr. Cooper.\\
130 - Leonard: This should be fun.\\
131 - Sheldon: Half chocolate, half vanilla, side by side, not swirled?\\
132 - Alex: Yes.\\
133 - Sheldon: Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?\\
134 - Alex: Rainbow, not chocolate.\\
135 - Sheldon: Two cherries?\\
136 - Alex: One on top, one on the bottom.\\
137 - Sheldon: Stems removed?\\
138 - Alex: Um, top one, yes. I didn’t check the one on the bottom.\\
139 - Leonard: Oh!\\
140 - Alex: I’m so sorry, Dr. Cooper.\\
141 - Sheldon: It’s all right, Alex. I’m not mad at you, I’m just disappointed.\\
142 - Leonard: Wait, Alex. Do you want to join us?\\
143 - Alex: Um…\\
144 - Sheldon: Uh, Alex, a moment. I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter. Do you think it’s appropriate for her to sit with us, given her station?\\
145 - Leonard: Given her what?\\
146 - Sheldon: If I’ve learned anything from British television shows on PBS, it’s that servants dine downstairs with their own kind.\\
147 - Leonard: What?\\
148 - Sheldon: It’s a kindness, Leonard. Otherwise, you’re cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that’s just beyond their soot-stained fingertips.\\
149 - Leonard: Oh, sure. Please join us.\\
150 - Alex: Oh, okay. Thank you.\\
151 - Leonard: So, Alex, what’s the topic of your dissertation?\\
152 - Alex: I’m looking for Trojan asteroids at Earth’s L-Five Lagrange point.\\
153 - Leonard: Oh, that happens to be Dr. Koothrappali’s field of expertise. You two have a lot to talk about.\\
154 - Alex: Is that true? Is he all right?\\
155 - Leonard: No. But compared to your boss, he’s the poster boy for sanity.\\
156 - Alex: It’s okay, I’ve been around scientists all my life. My dad’s an astronomer at SETI.\\
157 - Leonard: Oh, SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. You should introduce him to Sheldon. The search is over.\\
158 - Alex: So, what kind of research are you doing?\\
159 - Leonard: High-energy lasers.\\
160 - Alex: Ooh. Military?\\
161 - Leonard: Not yet, but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away.\\
162 - Amy (to Penny, on other side of room): You were right. I had nothing to worry about. That skank’s your problem, not mine.\\
163 - Alex: You’re very funny, Dr. Hofstadter.\\
164 - Leonard: Thank you.\\
165 - Sheldon (choking): Cherry stem! Cherry stem!\\
166 - Scene: Webcam conversation between Bernadette’s Office and the International Space Station\\
167 - Bernadette: How you doing, Howie? You feeling a little better?\\
168 - Howard: Oh, a lot better, thanks. One sec. Listen close, I don’t have a lot of time. I need you to go to my house. In my bedroom, you’ll find a model rocket. I want you to take it and bring it back to your place.\\
169 - Bernadette: Okay.\\
170 - Howard: Step two, build a version roughly fourteen stories high. Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me. I’ll leave the door unlocked.\\
171 - Bernadette: Howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone, let them know you’re having a little anxiety.\\
172 - Howard: No, no, I’m fine. No anxiety. We should probably talk in code. From now on, frog is me, sandwich means you and lemon means rocket. So, come on, sandwich, build me a lemon ’cause froggy wants to come home.\\
173 - Scene: Penny’s car.\\
174 - Amy: Look at you, putting on a brave face.\\
175 - Penny: There’s nothing to be brave about. Everything’s fine.\\
176 - Amy: Really? I don’t know how much you know about primate behaviour, but Sheldon’s assistant was clearly courting Leonard. Were she a mandrill, she would have bent over and displayed her brightly coloured hindquarters like a big red welcome mat. By the way, you try that at the junior prom, you get kicked out.\\
177 - Penny: Okay, maybe she was flirting with him, but who cares? Look, I don’t even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now.\\
178 - Amy: So says your prefrontal cortex. But meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to Leonard, it must be because he’s desirable.\\
179 - Penny: Well, of course he’s desirable. I mean, he’s great. He’s smart, he’s sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you, he really tries.\\
180 - Amy: So it does bother you.\\
181 - Penny: Fine, it bothers me a little. No. You know what? This is stupid. It doesn’t bother me. Okay, it bothers me. But only because she wouldn’t stop laughing. Leonard is not that funny.\\
182 - Amy: And there you have it, prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust. If this were a boxing match, they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala. If you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now.\\
183 - Scene: The apartment.\\
184 - Penny: So, how was work today?\\
185 - Leonard: Ah, it was all right, I guess. Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon. Caught Raj right in the eye.\\
186 - Penny: Oh! You’re kidding.\\
187 - Leonard: No, Raj had to go to the nurse.\\
188 - Penny: Wow. Anything else?\\
189 - Leonard: Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn’t talk to her. She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt.\\
190 - Penny: Oh, is that it?\\
191 - Leonard: Isn’t that enough? It had the weaponised fruit and a puppet. What more do you want?\\
192 - Sheldon (arriving with Alex): Oh, good, Leonard, you’re here. Science news. This will interest you. And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails.\\
193 - Leonard: What do you got?\\
194 - Sheldon: I believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize. Behold.\\
195 - Leonard: Magnets: What Do They Stick To? If the answer is metal, it’s not exactly groundbreaking.\\
196 - Sheldon: The original title was “A Rederivation of Maxwell’s Equations Regarding Electromagnetism”" I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.\\
197 - Alex: Sheldon thinks the approach in this paper might change the way we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis.\\
198 - Penny: Oh, it’s about time. I hated the old way. Hi. I’m Penny.\\
199 - Alex: Alex. Uh, do you work with Dr. Hofstadter?\\
200 - Penny: In a way. We’ve kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.\\
201 - Alex: Oh. Well, you’re lucky. He seems very talented. And I’m sure a lot of people want to work with him.\\
202 - Penny: Well, a lot of people can’t. Uh, hey.\\
203 - Leonard: Where are we going?\\
204 - Penny: My limbic system wants to take your pants off.\\
205 - Alex: She seems nice.\\
206 - Sheldon: Notice people on your own time. We’re working.\\
207 - Scene: Webcam conversation between Bernadette’s Office and the International Space Station\\
208 - Bernadette: Hey, Howie, how you feeling?\\
209 - Howard: Better. Much better. The other astronauts held me down, gave me a shot. Oooh. Attention, people of Earth. Tonight, there will be two moons in the sky.\\
210 - Bernadette: Howie, stop that. NASA’s watching this! Put your pants back on!\\
211 - Howard: Whee! Whee!
\subsection {Episode 04: The Re-Entry Minimisation}
1 - Scene: The Apartment.\\
2 - Raj: Howard’s capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute.\\
3 - Leonard: It’ll be good to have him back.\\
4 - Raj: The Fantastic Four reunited.\\
5 - Sheldon: Yeah, you had a good run, Fake Wolowitz. We’ll remember you with nostalgic fondness, the way we do the dial-up modem, the VHS tape, or, or Leonard’s gym membership.\\
6 - Raj: We’re not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.\\
7 - Sheldon: Okay, one vote for, one vote against. Leonard, you’re the tiebreaker.\\
8 - Leonard: I don’t have a problem with Stuart. Besides, he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store.\\
9 - Sheldon: Well, I don’t sell my friendship that cheaply.\\
10 - Stuart: I can go thirty.\\
11 - Sheldon: Welcome aboard, old chum.\\
12 - Raj: Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard’s final descent has begun.\\
13 - Sheldon: He left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero.\\
14 - Scene: The Soyuz Capsule. Howard is screaming.\\
15 - Dimitri: Loops, calm down!\\
16 - Howard (singing): Baruch atah, Adonai, Eloheinu. Melech haolam, hamotzi. Lechem min haaretz\\
17 - Mike: What’s that?\\
18 - Howard: The Jewish prayer for eating bread! We don’t have one for falling out of space! We did it! We’re on the ground! We survived!\\
19 - Mike: That was just the parachute. We still have another six miles to go. (Howard screams again)\\
20 - Credits sequence.\\
21 - Scene: The Airport Arrivals Hall.\\
22 - Bernadette: Waiting for my husband.\\
23 - Man in Suit: That’s nice.\\
24 - Bernadette: He’s coming back from outer space.\\
25 - Man in Suit: I think this flight’s coming from Houston.\\
26 - Bernadette: No, I mean, he… Never mind. There he is! Howie!\\
27 - Various others (all at once): Howie! Howie!\\
28 - Howard: Whoa, thank you. Great to be back on Earth.\\
29 - Howie Mandel: Uh, I think they’re here for me, Ringo.\\
30 - Man in Suit: Mr. Mandel, I’m your driver.\\
31 - Howie Mandel: Oh, thanks. That nut job was telling everybody on the plane he’s an astronaut.\\
32 - Bernadette: I missed you so much.\\
33 - Howard: I missed you, too. Where are the guys?\\
34 - Bernadette: Oh, it’s just me.\\
35 - Howard: Oh, I get it. They’re waiting back home with a big surprise party. Don’t worry, I can act surprised. (Does)\\
36 - Bernadette: No, I told them they could have you tomorrow night. Tonight, you belong to me. (Sneezes) \\
37 - Howard: Gesundheit. You okay?\\
38 - Bernadette: I am now that you’re back. Come on, let’s go home so I can tear off those little pants.\\
39 - Howard: Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting.\\
40 - Scene: The apartment. \\
41 - Sheldon: You know, I am very disappointed that I won’t be able to celebrate Howard’s accomplishment tonight.\\
42 - Amy: Me, too. But we’ll see him tomorrow.\\
43 - Sheldon: Yes, it’s just that in all the years I’ve known him, he’s never had the opportunity to receive my admiration. I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened.\\
44 - Penny: You’re unbelievable.\\
45 - Sheldon: I know.\\
46 - Leonard: All right, Pictionary. What are the teams?\\
47 - Penny: How about boys versus girls?\\
48 - Sheldon: Oh, that hardly seems fair. But I guess any team that I’m not on has a decided disadvantage.\\
49 - Penny: Once again, unbelievable.\\
50 - Sheldon: Yeah, once again, I know.\\
51 - Penny: All right, round one. Here.\\
52 - Sheldon: Got it.\\
53 - Penny: Okay. Ready, set, go.\\
54 - Amy: Uh, box? Uh, window?\\
55 - Leonard: Batman. Batman and Robin. Uh, Wonder Twins plus the monkey. Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman.\\
56 - Amy: Uh, gift? Uh, Present!\\
57 - Penny: Present! Yeah!\\
58 - Sheldon: Oh, Leonard. Now, how can you not get that?\\
59 - Leonard: In what universe is that a present?\\
60 - Sheldon: It’s not a present, it’s the present. Look. There’s you and me. There’s Penny and Amy. We’re playing Pictionary. In the present.\\
61 - Penny: Oh, my God, we’re gonna kill them.\\
62 - Later\\
63 - Sheldon: It’s a quark-gluon plasma.\\
64 - Leonard: No.\\
65 - Sheldon: It’s asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.\\
66 - Leonard: Nothing with quarks.\\
67 - Sheldon: It’s an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.\\
68 - Leonard: No.\\
69 - Penny: It’s a chocolate chip cookie.\\
70 - Amy: Yes.\\
71 - Leonard: How could you miss that?\\
72 - Sheldon: Hey, if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie, you draw a glass of milk next to it.\\
73 - Leonard: Penny got it.\\
74 - Sheldon: Yeah, only after I eliminated all the obvious answers. You’re welcome.\\
75 - Later\\
76 - Leonard: Oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage. Uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst? Oh, oh, a hot dog.\\
77 - Amy: Penny, aren’t you gonna draw something?\\
78 - Penny: Relax, we got time, this is so fun.\\
79 - Sheldon: There.\\
80 - Leonard: A solar system. Uh, uh, uh, uh, um, unidentified flying liverwurst? I don’t…\\
81 - Amy: Now?\\
82 - Penny: Soon.\\
83 - Sheldon: Come on, Leonard, I am spoon-feeding this to you.\\
84 - Leonard: I don’t know, uh, Casper the alcoholic ghost?\\
85 - Penny: All right, that’s enough. (Draws)\\
86 - Amy: Uh, hand. Uh, nail, polish?\\
87 - Penny: Yep!\\
88 - Sheldon: Wait, no, no. No. The word is Polish. See, look. Polish sausage. And the, the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer. And then, finally, if that wasn’t enough, which it should have been, this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized French citizen, was Polish by birth.\\
89 - Penny: Excuse me, the word is polish. See? Small P.\\
90 - Sheldon: Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.\\
91 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s Bedroom.\\
92 - Howard: Bernie, you okay?\\
93 - Bernadette (off): Yeah, I’ll be right there. (Hacking and coughing noises)\\
94 - Howard: Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?\\
95 - Bernadette: It’s just allergies.\\
96 - Howard: Okay.\\
97 - Bernadette: Took some Benadryl. I’ll be fine. So, did you miss me?\\
98 - Howard: Oh. Are you kidding? Every minute of every…\\
99 - Bernadette (has a coughing fit): Ew. Excuse me.\\
100 - Howard: Sweetie, we don’t have to do this now.\\
101 - Bernadette: Yes, we do. You left right after we got married. This is like our honeymoon. Now, hold on to your hat. Oh. Uh-oh.\\
102 - Howard: You okay?\\
103 - Bernadette: A little dizzy. Must be the Benadryl. Switch places with me.\\
104 - Howard: Okay.\\
105 - Bernadette: Now, kiss me. (He does. She starts snoring)\\
106 - Howard: Bernadette? Bernie? Bernie?\\
107 - Bernadette (waking suddenly): That was amazing. You made me feel things I never… (starts snoring again)\\
108 - Howard: Well, that was quick, and a little gross. Now, I know how she feels.\\
109 - Scene: The apartment. \\
110 - Penny: Hey, Sheldon, you’re always full of fun little facts. Where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from?\\
111 - Sheldon: Don’t know.\\
112 - Penny: I wonder if it’s from, like, ancient Rome where they’d actually chop somebody’s ass off and then go, here. You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers.\\
113 - Sheldon: I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.\\
114 - Leonard: Mmm, in all fairness, Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills. It’s a pretty well-rounded game.\\
115 - Sheldon: Lot of big talk from a man who can’t draw a chocolate chip cookie.\\
116 - Penny: All right, fine, pick another game. Amy and I will beat you at anything.\\
117 - Sheldon: All right. Let’s play Physics Fiesta.\\
118 - Penny: Oh, come on, what is that?\\
119 - Sheldon: It’s a game that I just invented, in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish. Um, ¿Dónde está el boson de Higgs?\\
120 - Leonard: En el acelerador de particulares.\\
121 - Sheldon: Bueno, mi amigo.\\
122 - Penny: No, no, we’re not playing some dumb made-up game.\\
123 - Sheldon: All games are made up. They’re not found in nature. You don’t just dig in the ground, come across a rich vein of Rock’em Sock’em Robots.\\
124 - Leonard: Just pick another game.\\
125 - Amy: Why don’t we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?\\
126 - Leonard: No good, Sheldon doesn’t float.\\
127 - Sheldon: That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown.\\
128 - Amy: All right, let’s keep it simple. How about darts?\\
129 - Sheldon: No, that’s not fair either.\\
130 - Penny: Why not?\\
131 - Sheldon: Darts is a bar game. You’ve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.\\
132 - Leonard: Yeah, that’s when it started.\\
133 - Sheldon: Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests, they’re all out.\\
134 - Penny: Okay. Just for the record, I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest. I’ve won a few, but that’s just because I spill when I’m drunk, so…\\
135 - Amy: We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play real-life Operation.\\
136 - Sheldon: No.\\
137 - Leonard: Uh-uh.\\
138 - Penny: I don’t think so.\\
139 - Amy: Are you sure? I mean, the nose doesn’t light up, but if the corpse is fresh enough, sometimes you can get the leg to jerk.\\
140 - Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s House.\\
141 - Howard: Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home. Ma, the chain’s on the door.\\
142 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard? I thought I wasn’t going to see you till tomorrow.\\
143 - Howard: Yeah, well, Bernie’s not feeling well, so I thought I’d stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it.\\
144 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Uh, uh, okay, hold on, I’m not decent.\\
145 - Howard: All right. Woman hasn’t tied her robe in 20 years. Suddenly she’s not decent?\\
146 - Man’s Voice (off): You want me to hide in the closet or go out the back?\\
147 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Shh, you need to whisper.\\
148 - Howard: Ma, who is in there?\\
149 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Uh, nobody. The TV is on.\\
150 - Man’s Voice (off): I only got one sock. Where’s my other sock?\\
151 - Howard: Who is that?\\
152 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): I told you, it’s the TV. Jay Leno lost a sock, it’s hilarious.\\
153 - Howard: If you’re busy, I can come back.\\
154 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Just give me a second. Go, go, go, go.\\
155 - Howard (to man climbing out window): Dr. Schneider?\\
156 - Dr Schneider: Oh, hello, Howard.\\
157 - Howard: What are you doing here?\\
158 - Dr Schneider: Um, house call.\\
159 - Howard: You’re a dentist.\\
160 - Dr Schneider: Yes, yes, I am. I think he’s on to us.\\
161 - Scene: The apartment.\\
162 - Penny: Okay, glasses off. Find Waldo.\\
163 - Sheldon: Hurry up, find him, find him.\\
164 - Leonard: I’m trying. Don’t yell at me.\\
165 - Sheldon: For goodness’ sake, he’s wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt.\\
166 - Leonard: I know what he looks like.\\
167 - Amy: Oh, there he is, I got him.\\
168 - Penny: Yes, we win again.\\
169 - Sheldon: How could you not find him?\\
170 - Leonard: Because he’s hard to find. If he was easy to find, the books would be called There’s Waldo.\\
171 - Later. Penny and Sheldon have their foreheads on light sabres and are spinning.\\
172 - Leonard: 57, 58, 59, that’s one minute.\\
173 - Amy: Long division, long division. Go, go, go.\\
174 - Leonard: Remember, show your work.\\
175 - Sheldon: I’m okay. I’m okay. I’m not okay.\\
176 - Leonard: Get up, we can’t lose at math.\\
177 - Penny: 37.\\
178 - Amy: Yes.\\
179 - Later \\
180 - Amy: Ready, set, wrestle. (Penny pins Sheldon straight away) One, two, three, pin.\\
181 - Penny: Mwah!\\
182 - Sheldon: Stop that.\\
183 - Penny: Mwah!\\
184 - Sheldon: Amy, do something. Amy, help. Amy, stop that. Amy, Penny, both of you, stop it.\\
185 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
186 - Howard: One to beam aboard?\\
187 - Raj: Oh, my God, you’re back. Oh, look at you. You, you look like you grew.\\
188 - Howard: Yeah. The lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so I’m like an inch and a half taller. I’m going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed before I shrink back.\\
189 - Raj: Oh, uh, come in, come in. Oh, I, uh, I didn’t think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.\\
190 - Howard: Yeah, well, Bernadette’s a little under the weather and my mom’s kind of under my dentist.\\
191 - Raj: Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?\\
192 - Howard: Former dentist. I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.\\
193 - Raj: So you’re wandering all around by yourself? That’s not the kind of hero’s welcome an astronaut should come home to.\\
194 - Howard: It’s okay, you know, we space cowboys don’t do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels.\\
195 - Stuart: Oh, hey, man, welcome back.\\
196 - Howard: Oh, Stuart, thanks. What are you doing here?\\
197 - Stuart: I, I kind of live here now.\\
198 - Raj: Just until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday.\\
199 - Stuart: Ah, he’s spoiling me and I love it.\\
200 - Howard: Wow, so you guys are like buds now?\\
201 - Raj: Oh, yeah, we hang out all the time.\\
202 - Stuart: Plus, he doesn’t have a girlfriend, I don’t have a girlfriend.\\
203 - Raj: It’s like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other’s holes.\\
204 - Stuart: Uh, that sounds a little funny to an American ear.\\
205 - Raj: Which part?\\
206 - Stuart: Just all of it.\\
207 - Howard: Okay, so what do you guys got going on tonight?\\
208 - Stuart: Raj is taking me to the Sound of Music sing-along.\\
209 - Howard: Sound of Music sing-along? That used to be our thing, but that’s cool.\\
210 - Raj: Oh, Howard, it’s still our thing. Come with us, we’ll, we’ll get you a scalped ticket.\\
211 - Howard: So I’d be sitting by myself?\\
212 - Raj: We’ll switch. You’ll come sit with me after intermission.\\
213 - Stuart: So I, I, I’d be sitting by myself during Edelweiss?\\
214 - Howard: No, no, you guys go. Have fun.\\
215 - Raj: Okay, uh, will I get to see you tomorrow?\\
216 - Howard: Absolutely. See you, Stuart.\\
217 - Stuart: Yeah, yeah. Is he taller?\\
218 - Howard: At least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.\\
219 - Scene: The apartment. \\
220 - Penny: All right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are, no hands, first one to clean the pan wins.\\
221 - Amy: On the count of three. One, two…\\
222 - Sheldon: Wait. I’m a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.\\
223 - Leonard: So?\\
224 - Sheldon: So, with all those antioxidants, what if I run out of oxidants?\\
225 - Leonard: Sheldon, we haven’t won a game all night. Now, you either stick your face in that pie or I’m gonna stick that pie in your face.\\
226 - Sheldon: That’s rude.\\
227 - Amy: One, two, three, eat.\\
228 - Howard: Hey, guys, guess who’s back from space.\\
229 - All: Not now!\\
230 - Sheldon: Oh, ow, blueberry in my nose, blueberry in my nose!\\
231 - Leonard: Snort it down and keep eating!\\
232 - Scene: A diner.\\
233 - Waitress: You look familiar.\\
234 - Howard: I don’t think so.\\
235 - Waitress: Yeah, I just saw you on the news. You’re an astronaut.\\
236 - Howard: Yes. Yes, I am.\\
237 - Waitress: Good for you. How about a piece of cheesecake on the house?\\
238 - Howard: Oh, thank you so much. I’ve been having the worst night. I just got back, and my friends don’t care, my wife’s sick, I went to my mom…\\
239 - Waitress: You want the cheesecake or not?\\
240 - Howard: Yes, please. (Sings) And I think it’s gonna be long, long time till touchdown brings me ’round again to find I’m not the man they think I am at home, oh, no, oh, no, I’m a rocket man. (Sneezes) Perfect.
\subsection {Episode 05: The Holographic Excitation}
1 - Scene: The Comic Book Store\\
2 - Howard: Oh, hey, Stuart, I got you a little souvenir from my trip to space.\\
3 - Stuart: Well, Howard, that’s very nice of you.\\
4 - Leonard: Yeah, maybe. Open it first.\\
5 - Howard: It’s my official NASA portrait.\\
6 - Stuart: To Stuart, your comic book store is out of this world. Just like the guy in this picture was.”\\
7 - Sheldon: For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world.\\
8 - Howard: That’s not true. At the Walgreens I was over the moon for their store-brand antacids.\\
9 - Raj: Hey, Stuart, I see you’re getting ready for your Halloween party.\\
10 - Stuart: Yeah, it’s my annual attempt to meet women. Ninth time’s the charm.\\
11 - Raj: Would you like me to help? I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.\\
12 - Stuart: Thanks, but I can’t afford je ne sais quois. How much for just quois?\\
13 - Raj: You know, you don’t worry about money. I’ll take care of everything.\\
14 - Stuart: Really?\\
15 - Raj: Yeah, you’ll love it. Ain’t no party like a Koothra-party.\\
16 - Howard: But you know what wasn’t a party? That hotel in Kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch. I mean, it’s your last night on Earth. You’d think you’d get one p0rn channel.\\
17 - Leonard: Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?\\
18 - Sheldon: Interesting hypothesis. Let’s apply the scientific method, perform an experiment.\\
19 - Leonard: Okay. Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?\\
20 - Howard: Anywhere but the Space Station. On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf. But, hey, you don’t go there for the food, you go there for the view.\\
21 - Sheldon: It’s fascinating. Let me see if I can duplicate the result. Howard, I’ve always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. Care to weigh in?\\
22 - Howard: Not really.\\
23 - Sheldon: Oh, well.\\
24 - Howard: You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon. But, hey, that baby got me to space and back.\\
25 - Credits sequence.\\
26 - Scene: The Cheesecake Factory Bar\\
27 - Amy: Ladies night at the Cheesecake Factory. Does it get any better than this?\\
28 - Penny: I hope so.\\
29 - Amy: Question. Do you think your husband’s fondness for turtlenecks is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin?\\
30 - Penny: It’s not getting any better. (Text tone) Ugh. It’s Leonard. He wants to go costume shopping later.\\
31 - Bernadette: I thought you liked Halloween.\\
32 - Penny: I do, it’s just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store. A lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy.\\
33 - Bernadette: Like my husband?\\
34 - Amy: And my boyfriend?\\
35 - Penny: I’m, I’m sorry, Amy. You were saying something about Howard’s foreskin?\\
36 - Bernadette: Nice try, but you have to go to that party because we’re going.\\
37 - Penny: Yeah, I’m gonna go. It’s just not my idea of a good time.\\
38 - Bernadette: Leonard does thing he doesn’t like to make you happy.\\
39 - Penny: Well, yeah, he’s my boyfriend. Isn’t that, like, his job?\\
40 - Amy: Then what’s your job?\\
41 - Penny: Letting him make me happy.\\
42 - Bernadette: I just think in relationships you get back what you put into them.\\
43 - Amy: That’s not always true. Last night I gave Sheldon my best come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated.\\
44 - Penny: I guess I could probably try a little harder.\\
45 - Bernadette: You could start by taking an interest in his work.\\
46 - Penny: Yeah, that’s kind of a problem.\\
47 - Amy: Why?\\
48 - Penny: Not really clear on what he does.\\
49 - Bernadette: He’s an experimental physicist.\\
50 - Penny: Yeah, I’m not really clear on what that means.\\
51 - Amy: He takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine their accuracy.\\
52 - Penny: Yeah, you’re really just making it worse.\\
53 - Scene: The apartment.\\
54 - Sheldon: What kind of tea would you like?\\
55 - Amy: I think I’m gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.\\
56 - Sheldon: Two tea bags in one cup? You’re not at a rave.\\
57 - Amy: So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking, since this is gonna be our first Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, I thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume.\\
58 - Sheldon: I couldn’t agree more.\\
59 - Amy: Really? I find that inconsistent with everything I know about you.\\
60 - Sheldon: Oh, oh, on the contrary. Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. Now imagine this, you and I entering Stuart’s party and all eyes turn to see America’s most beloved and glamorous couple.\\
61 - Amy: Yeah?\\
62 - Sheldon: R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on Threepio.\\
63 - Amy: Sheldon, when I said couples costume, I meant like Romeo and Juliet or Cinderella and Prince Charming, not two robots from some silly movie I don’t even like.\\
64 - Sheldon: Okay, I’m gonna let that slide because I know you’re hopped up on tea bags.\\
65 - Amy: I make compromises for you all the time. Just this once, can’t we find something that we’re both happy with?\\
66 - Sheldon: Fine. How about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century? Hewlett and Packard. Dibs on Hewlett. What? You want to be Hewlett?\\
67 - Scene: Leonard’s laboratory.\\
68 - Penny: Anybody home?\\
69 - Leonard: Hey, what are you doing here?\\
70 - Penny: I just thought I’d stop by and say hello.\\
71 - Leonard: Oh, what a nice surprise. I don’t think you’ve ever seen my lab before.\\
72 - Penny: No, I know. It’s long overdue. So, what ya doing? Better not be building a robot girlfriend.\\
73 - Leonard: No. Although Howard was making some real strides in that area until he met Bernadette.\\
74 - Penny: You’re kidding.\\
75 - Leonard: Nope. Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.\\
76 - Penny: Ooh! What’s going on in here?\\
77 - Leonard: Oh, no, no, no, don’t look in there.\\
78 - Penny: What, is it secret?\\
79 - Leonard: No, it’s a nitrogen laser. It’ll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.\\
80 - Penny: Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.\\
81 - Leonard: Sign right there.\\
82 - Penny: Ah. Danger. Sure, sure. Yeah. What’s, what’s that?\\
83 - Leonard: Uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.\\
84 - Penny: Wow. High-techie-techie. What’s this little box?\\
85 - Leonard: That is a pencil sharpener.\\
86 - Penny: Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on right now?\\
87 - Leonard: It’s actually pretty neat.\\
88 - Penny: Yeah?\\
89 - Leonard: Yeah. It’s a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here, I’ll show you. We’ll just put this pencil over here.\\
90 - Penny: Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.\\
91 - Leonard: Very good. And then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila. (A floating 3D image of the pencil appears. Leonard moves it around with his finger)\\
92 - Penny: Wow. That is amazing.\\
93 - Leonard: You know, there’s a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram.\\
94 - Penny: What do you mean? (Leonard flicks a switch. The hologram changes to a view of the planet Earth). Oh! Wow!\\
95 - Leonard: Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really (changes view to solar system) just be information (changes view to the galaxy) on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos. (Starts the galaxy spinning) So it’s possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.\\
96 - Penny: Hmm.\\
97 - Leonard: What?\\
98 - Penny: Sometimes I forget how smart you are.\\
99 - Leonard: You should visit more often. What are you doing?\\
100 - Penny: Take off your clothes.\\
101 - Leonard: What? Here? Now?\\
102 - Penny: Yeah. You got a problem with that?\\
103 - Leonard: No, no. It’s kind of crazy. I’ve never fooled around in the lab before.\\
104 - Penny: Really? Never?\\
105 - Leonard: No. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn’t long enough.\\
106 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
107 - Raj: Before I forget, I’d like your opinion on the menus I’ve prepared for the Halloween party. The theme is food that goes bump in the night.\\
108 - Howard: Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon.\\
109 - Raj: On Sesame seed Bunzillas.\\
110 - Sheldon: Night of the Living Garlic Bread?\\
111 - Raj: It’s funny because bread sounds like dead.\\
112 - Sheldon: I’m sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.\\
113 - Raj: Ooh, Hallow-weenies! That’s a good one. They’ll pair nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?\\
114 - Howard: That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume. But then I realized everyone would be, like, where’s your costume? Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?\\
115 - Leonard: Hello, boys.\\
116 - Sheldon: What are you smiling at?\\
117 - Leonard: Nothing.\\
118 - Howard: You know where’s there’s a lot of nothing.\\
119 - All: Space.\\
120 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.\\
121 - Howard: Boy, it’s nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again. Did I tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my mouth and into the air lock?\\
122 - Bernadette: Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.\\
123 - Howard: So, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds. What to do? What to do to you? Astronaut Wolowitz, reporting for booty. Preparing thrusters. We have liftoff. Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?\\
124 - Bernadette: Okay, we need to talk.\\
125 - Howard: What?\\
126 - Bernadette: Howie, I know you went to space. I’m incredibly proud of you. But you might want to try and not bring it up every minute.\\
127 - Howard: I don’t talk about it every minute.\\
128 - Bernadette: Tonight at dinner you went on bout it for an hour straight.\\
129 - Howard: What was I supposed to talk about? We were eating at Johnny Rockets.\\
130 - Bernadette: I’m just saying, people are getting a little tired of it.\\
131 - Howard: So, I did this amazing thing and I’m never allowed to mention it?\\
132 - Bernadette: Of course you can. But maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up.\\
133 - Howard: Okay, no problem. It won’t happen again.\\
134 - Bernadette: I love you.\\
135 - Howard: I love you, too. I can’t tell you how many times I dreamed I was in bed here with you when I was… you know. What, I can’t even point?\\
136 - Scene: Leonard’s lab.\\
137 - Leonard: So, basically, this is what’s called mag-lev technology. It uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity. Here, you hold this.\\
138 - Penny: Whoa! That’s heavy.\\
139 - Leonard: Yeah. Oh, uh, you don’t have on any jewellery, do you?\\
140 - Penny: No. Why?\\
141 - Leonard: A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings. Now he’s on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size. Now watch this.\\
142 - Penny: Whoa! That is very cool.\\
143 - Leonard: Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I’m the super villain Magneto.\\
144 - Penny: Getting a little less cool, Leonard.\\
145 - Leonard: But what I really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.\\
146 - Penny: There we go.\\
147 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
148 - Raj: So, I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy’s tomb, or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who.\\
149 - Sheldon: A Tardis makes no sense. It’s a time machine from a science-fiction show. It has nothing to do with Halloween. That being said, if you don’t get a Tardis, you stink and your party stinks.\\
150 - Raj: Do you have a preference?\\
151 - Howard: I don’t care. Get the Tardis.\\
152 - Sheldon: Yes! This party just became a major rager.\\
153 - Raj: Oh, by the way, can I borrow your bullwhip and fedora?\\
154 - Howard: Yeah, sure, whatever.\\
155 - Raj: I was thinking of dressing up as Indiana Jones’ mocha-skinned love child. Indian Jones.\\
156 - Howard: Clever.\\
157 - Raj: What’s wrong with you?\\
158 - Howard: Nothing.\\
159 - Raj: Oh, Howard, I’ve got a party to plan. Don’t make me pull it out of you.\\
160 - Howard: Okay, here it is. Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space. Is that true?\\
161 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
162 - Raj: No.\\
163 - Sheldon: We seem to have different approaches here. I was going for helpful honesty. I have no idea what you’re doing.\\
164 - Raj: It’s called being nice.\\
165 - Sheldon: Okay. If you think being nice will get him to shut up, I’ll try it.\\
166 - Howard: You know what, guys? Never mind. I just won’t talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again.\\
167 - Sheldon: Look at that, the problem solved itself.\\
168 - Leonard: Hello, boys.\\
169 - Scene: The apartment.\\
170 - Sheldon: What if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt and pepper?\\
171 - Amy: You know salt makes me retain water and my cousin William was ground to death in a pepper factory accident. How about Raggedy Ann and Andy? I loved them growing up.\\
172 - Sheldon: No, I don’t think so. Those dolls represent three things I do not care for, clowns, children and raggediness. I think it’s a lost cause.\\
173 - Amy: No. There are certain things that say to the world, I have a boyfriend, and he’s not made up. Matching costumes, hickeys and s*x tapes. Pick one.\\
174 - Sheldon: What’s a hickey?\\
175 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom. Howard and Bernadette are dressed as smurfs.\\
176 - Bernadette: How do I look?\\
177 - Howard: Fine.\\
178 - Bernadette: Uh-oh, is someone a little blue? Come on, Howie, that’s like the funniest thing I’ve ever said in my life. What do you say? You ready to go?\\
179 - Howard: To tell you the truth, I’m not really in the mood.\\
180 - Bernadette: What are you talking about? It’ll be fun. All your friends’ll be there.\\
181 - Howard: Yeah, some friends. They all think I’m boring. Maybe you should go without me.\\
182 - Bernadette: No, if I’m there alone, people might think I’m just a really short person from Avatar.\\
183 - Howard: I’m sorry. I just don’t want to go.\\
184 - Bernadette: Hey, I just spent the last three hours colouring myself blue. I’m gonna be washing paint out of my Smurf for a month.\\
185 - Howard: Fine. Two weeks ago I was an astronaut.\\
186 - Bernadette: Yeah, well, now you’re a Smurf. Keep walking.\\
187 - Scene: The comic book store.\\
188 - Penny: Oh, my God, you guys look adorable.\\
189 - Bernadette: Thanks, so do you. Slutty cop?\\
190 - Penny: No, sexy cop. Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges.\\
191 - Bernadette: And Albert Einstein?\\
192 - Leonard: Ja, und later she’s going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light.\\
193 - Penny: I thought we said in the car, no accents?\\
194 - Leonard: Sorry, Officer.\\
195 - Girl dressed as a Witch: Hello. It’s a great party.\\
196 - Stuart: Thank you.\\
197 - Witch: The monster foods, they’re really fun.\\
198 - Stuart: Oh, yes, thank you. I like to think of fun things like that because I’m fun. I’m not clinically depressed at all.\\
199 - Amy: Sheldon, get in here.\\
200 - Sheldon: I should’ve picked hickey.\\
201 - Stuart: Hey, hey, look at you guys!\\
202 - Amy: I’m Raggedy Ann, and he’s Raggedy C-3PO.\\
203 - Sheldon: It was a compromise. I lost.\\
204 - Raj: Can you believe Stuart’s walking around taking credit for this party?\\
205 - Howard: Who cares?\\
206 - Raj: What do you mean who cares? Look at what I pulled off here. The DJ’s on fire, there’s a Tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my God, the food. Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese.\\
207 - Howard: You’re right, the party’s fantastic. Please, tell me more. I haven’t heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old.\\
208 - Raj: Is this about the space thing again?\\
209 - Howard: Well, I’m not allowed to talk about it, but since you brought it up, I went to space! Space, space! Space! Space, space! Space!\\
210 - Bernadette: Whoa, Drinky Smurf. Can I talk to you for a second?\\
211 - Howard: Great, now I’m in trouble. You happy?\\
212 - Bernadette: You, out! You are being very rude.\\
213 - Howard: No, I’m not. They’re all being rude. And you’re being rude.\\
214 - Bernadette: Me? What did I do?\\
215 - Howard (in a squeaky voice): Oh, Howie, stop talking about space so much. Nobody likes it.\\
216 - Bernadette (in a gruff voice): I don’t sound like that.\\
217 - Howard: You’re my wife. You’re supposed to be on my side.\\
218 - Bernadette: I’m always on your side.\\
219 - Howard: Then why are you trying to take this away from me? Being an astronaut is the coolest thing I’m ever gonna do. If I stop talking about it, then I’m just…\\
220 - Bernadette: Just what?\\
221 - Howard: Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.\\
222 - Bernadette: Plain old Howard Wolowitz is the best guy I know.\\
223 - Howard: You’re just saying that.\\
224 - Bernadette: No, I’m not. I married him. On purpose. Come here.\\
225 - Howard: I love you.\\
226 - Bernadette: I love you, too.\\
227 - Penny (emerging from Tardis): Nothing to see here. Just sexy police business.\\
228 - Leonard: Just explaining the theory of relativity. Twice.\\
229 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.\\
230 - Bernadette: Hey, what you watching?\\
231 - Howard: I don’t know. Raj sent me some video of Buzz Aldrin.\\
232 - Buzz (on video, handing Halloween candy to children): Here you go. It’s a Milky Way. The Milky Way’s a galaxy in space. I’ve been in space. Here’s a Mars bar. I’m an astronaut. And this one’s a Moon Pie. I walked on the Moon. What have you done?\\
233 - Howard: Okay, I get it.
\subsection {Episode 06: The Extract Obliteration}
1 - Scene: A dance video game where the characters are imperial stormtroopers from Star Wars and Bobba Fett. Opens onto the apartment where Howard and Raj are dancing to the game.\\
2 - Raj: Try to keep up, Howard, I’m killing it.\\
3 - Howard: Yeah, I wish we looked as cool dancing in clubs as we do right now.\\
4 - Leonard: Don’t worry, this is exactly how you look when you’re dancing in clubs.\\
5 - Raj: You’re welcome, ladies.\\
6 - Sheldon: Paradigm-shifting news, gentlemen. (Switches game off)\\
7 - Raj: Dude! I was about to Bollywood this bitch.\\
8 - Sheldon: Earlier today, I invited Professor Stephen Hawking to join me in the popular online game Words with Friends. Moments ago, he accepted my request. Do you understand what that means?\\
9 - Howard: That somewhere right now Stephen Hawking is saying, damn it, I meant to click no.”\\
10 - Sheldon: I’ll walk you through it. The game is not called Words with Strangers. No, it’s not even called Words with Acquaintances. It is called Words with…\\
11 - Raj: I’m not finishing your sentence. You pulled the plug on my funk.\\
12 - Sheldon: Friends! It’s Words with Friends! Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are. Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide, I’ll have everything I’ve ever wanted since I was six years old.\\
13 - Leonard: That’s really nice, Sheldon, I’m happy for you.\\
14 - Sheldon: And I’m happy for you, too. You are now friends with someone who is officially friends with Stephen Hawking. Enjoy it, boys. You may have peaked.\\
15 - Howard: Sheldon, I know Stephen Hawking. I worked with him.\\
16 - Sheldon: And if they ever come out with a game called Words with People You Once Worked With, you’ll be off to the races.\\
17 - Leonard: Sheldon, I don’t think this actually means…\\
18 - Sheldon: Hold that thought! Professor Hawking has made a move. Boy, oh, boy. Oh, it’s only a matter of time before we’re coming up with fun nicknames for each other. I’ll be Coop. He’ll be Wheels. If he’s okay with that. (Leaves)\\
19 - Raj (putting game back on and removing shirt): All right. Crank up the AC, boys, it’s gonna get hot in here!\\
20 - Credits sequence.\\
21 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
22 - Bernadette: So, I was taking a shower this morning, and when I got out, I started to dry off with what I thought was a towel but turned out to be Howard’s mom’s underwear. I had to take another shower. It wasn’t enough. Nothing will ever be enough.\\
23 - Amy: I once looked in Sheldon’s underwear drawer. He yelled at me. But now I know what it looks like and he can never take that away.\\
24 - Bernadette: There’s a book under here.\\
25 - Penny: Oh, I’ll get that.\\
26 - Bernadette: I got it.\\
27 - Penny: No, no, it’s…\\
28 - Bernadette: I got it. Why do you have a history textbook?\\
29 - Penny: No, it’s not a big deal. Just taking a class at the Pasadena Community College.\\
30 - Bernadette: That’s great. I didn’t know you wanted to go back to school.\\
31 - Penny: It’s just one history class. Look, I didn’t finish college, so I thought I would give it a try.\\
32 - Amy: Not to mention, your acting career is going south like Sherman. Read about it in your book.\\
33 - Bernadette: Why would you be embarrassed to tell us?\\
34 - Penny: No, I’m not embarrassed. I just didn’t want anyone to know because I haven’t told Leonard yet.\\
35 - Amy: Why wouldn’t you tell Leonard?\\
36 - Penny: Because it’s me going back to school, and he’s gonna be all “you can do it,” and “how can I help?” and “I’m so proud of you.” Ugh!\\
37 - Bernadette: I just can’t believe you could keep something like that from him.\\
38 - Amy: You guys have got to be the weirdest couple I know.\\
39 - Penny: Really? You can’t think of anyone weirder?\\
40 - Amy: I can, but she’s sitting right there.\\
41 - Scene: Amy’s laboratory.\\
42 - Sheldon: Yes. I play the word quiver with a triple letter and a double word score for 72 points. That ought to let the air out of your tyres, Hawking.\\
43 - Amy: Wow, my boyfriend is friends with Stephen Hawking and my new dandruff shampoo doesn’t smell like tar. Everything really is coming up Amy.\\
44 - Sheldon: It is glorious. One of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits. And I’m spanking him so hard his grad students won’t be able to sit down.\\
45 - Amy: You know, when one male dominates another, his testosterone level rises.\\
46 - Sheldon: What’s your point?\\
47 - Amy: It’s exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level.\\
48 - Sheldon: Ooh, my friend Stephen just played the word act for 18 points. That’s right, I call him Stephen now, because I checked, and he was not okay with Wheels.\\
49 - Amy: Oh, you could turn his act into extract (pronounced with emphasis on act), and it would be for double points.\\
50 - Sheldon: Amy. Why would you give me a word? Now, if I play extract it would be cheating.\\
51 - Amy: Sorry.\\
52 - Sheldon: Although, I could play the completely unrelated and better word extract (pronounced with emphasis on ex). Ethical conundrum avoided. Thanks, brain.\\
53 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
54 - Penny: Spaghetti okay?\\
55 - Leonard: It’s crunchy. Just the way I like it.\\
56 - Penny: Yeah, I don’t think the water was really boiling.\\
57 - Leonard: It’s great. I love it.\\
58 - Penny: Okay, listen, there’s something I need to tell you. I’ve been thinking about going back to school for a while now. So a couple months ago, I started taking a history class at the community college.\\
59 - Leonard: Oh. That’s great. Great, great, great. Why wait so long to tell me?\\
60 - Penny: I don’t want you to make a big deal out of it.\\
61 - Leonard: Why do you think I’d be like that? I get it, you’re taking one class. It’s nice. Maybe if it goes well, you take another, you enrol full-time. Ooh, be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college.\\
62 - Penny: You’re making it a big deal.\\
63 - Leonard: Sorry. Whatever. It’s all good.\\
64 - Penny: Anyway, that’s it. I just thought you should know.\\
65 - Leonard: Am I allowed to ask how the class is going?\\
66 - Penny: It’s really good. We’ve been talking about the origins of slavery. Turn in my first paper tomorrow.\\
67 - Leonard: Great topic. I can help with that. There are lots of different perspectives you can take, economic, sociological, political.\\
68 - Penny: Hey hey hey, this is my paper. And my perspective is that slavery is bad. Oh, and my professor’s black, so I’m pretty sure that’s the right answer.\\
69 - Leonard: Can I take a look?\\
70 - Penny: No, Leonard, this is my thing.\\
71 - Leonard: Okay, I get it.\\
72 - Penny: Thank you.\\
73 - Leonard: It’s like when I started doing chin-ups, I didn’t want you to see until I could do one. FYI, really close.\\
74 - Penny: Thank you. Now behave yourself and eat your dinner. Maybe later, if you’re lucky, you get to sleep with a college girl.\\
75 - Leonard: Really? ‘Cause I went to four years of college and five years of grad school, that never happened once.\\
76 - Scene: The apartment.\\
77 - Raj: I think the next time I have to speak to a call centre in India, I’m going to try using an American accent.\\
78 - Howard: Why?\\
79 - Raj: Because when I use my regular voice, I feel like I’m making fun of them.\\
80 - Howard: That’s ridiculous. Not to mention, your American accent is terrible.\\
81 - Raj: Dude, my accent is brilliant. (In American accent) Hey, my snow-white American friends, let’s put some cow meat on the barbecue and eat it until we’re all obese.\\
82 - Howard: This is what you sound like. I think I’m talking in an American accent, but it really sounds like I’m wearing a set of giant dentures.\\
83 - Raj: Sheldon, do I really sound like that?\\
84 - Howard: Tell him he sounds like that.\\
85 - Raj: Sheldon, you okay?\\
86 - Sheldon: It’s been three days. Why hasn’t Stephen Hawking played a word?\\
87 - Raj: The guy’s a genius. Maybe you weren’t challenging enough for him.\\
88 - Sheldon: Not challenging? I was humiliating the man. I was thinking of writing a book called A Brief History of the Time I Made Stephen Hawking Cry Like a Little Girl.\\
89 - Howard: There’s the problem. You can’t beat Hawking like that. He hates to lose. Everyone knows the guy’s a big baby. I mean, forget the wheelchair, he should be in a stroller.\\
90 - Sheldon: Really?\\
91 - Howard: One time when I was working with him, he said that Johnny Depp was in The Matrix. I told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting. So I looked it up online and showed him. Well, the next day, he had a pizza party, and everyone got invited but me. And then he was all, your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix.\\
92 - Sheldon: Good Lord, what have I done?\\
93 - Raj (in American accent): Good Lord, what have I done?\\
94 - Howard: Terrible.\\
95 - Raj: All right, hotshot, let’s hear your Indian.\\
96 - Howard: I can’t sit on that elephant, my ass is on fire from eating all this curry.\\
97 - Raj: Okay, yeah, that’s pretty good.\\
98 - Scene: Penny’s bedroom. Leonard sneaks from the bed and opens Penny’s computer. \\
99 - Leonard: Please be good. Please be good. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. She writes like she cooks.\\
100 - Scene: The apartment.\\
101 - Sheldon: Play. Play. Play. Play. Play.\\
102 - Leonard: What are you doing?\\
103 - Sheldon: Trying to use a Jedi mind trick to control Stephen Hawking. Play. Play. Ugh! He must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something.\\
104 - Leonard: I did a bad thing.\\
105 - Sheldon: Does it affect me?\\
106 - Leonard: No.\\
107 - Sheldon: Then suffer in silence. Play. Play. Play. (Knock knock knock) Stephen Hawking. (Knock knock knock) Stephen Hawking. (Knock knock knock) Stephen Hawking.\\
108 - Leonard: Penny started taking a class. She wrote a paper, she didn’t want me to read it, I went behind her back and I read it anyway.\\
109 - Sheldon: Stephen Hawking hates me.\\
110 - Leonard: I don’t know what to do. I mean, the paper’s terrible. But if I tell her, she’ll know that I read it and she’ll get really mad.\\
111 - Sheldon: I was beating him so bad, he doesn’t want to be friends anymore. Why does everyone love me except Stephen Hawking?\\
112 - Leonard: Is it possible we’re having two different conversations?\\
113 - Sheldon: How would I know? I’m not listening to you.\\
114 - Leonard: Hang on. Okay, here’s what we’re gonna do. Chess clock. We each get five minutes to talk about our problems. We’ll take turns. Each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend. Begin.\\
115 - Sheldon: I humiliated Stephen Hawking in a game of Words with Friends. He stopped playing, and now we’re not friends anymore.\\
116 - Leonard: He’s probably busy. You’re worried about nothing. Give it a couple more days. I’m sure he’ll play, and you’ll see that everything’s fine. My turn. I can’t let Penny hand in a bad paper, but how do I tell her it’s bad without letting her know that I read it?\\
117 - Sheldon: Hmm. Beats me. Now, I know Hawking’s not busy because I can see he’s playing other people right now.\\
118 - Leonard: Maybe since you’re so good, he’s taking his time to meet the challenge. I want Penny to enjoy school…\\
119 - Sheldon: Wolowitz told me he’s a big baby. But I didn’t know that, and I played extract for 82 points. It’s all Amy’s fault. She told me to play it. I have got to cut her loose.\\
120 - Leonard: Sheldon, I wasn’t done talking. She hands in the paper tomorrow. I know I could help her. And she’s my girlfriend. I, I should be allowed to help her. Why aren’t I allowed to help her?\\
121 - Sheldon: Yeah, I hear you, brother.\\
122 - Leonard: No. You need to give me some advice.\\
123 - Sheldon: Fine. Women, huh?\\
124 - Leonard: No, specific to my situation.\\
125 - Sheldon: Blonde women, huh?\\
126 - Leonard: Empathetic.\\
127 - Sheldon: It sucks to be you.\\
128 - Leonard: I quit.\\
129 - Sheldon: Leonard, wait. No. I listened to your dumb thing. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back.\\
130 - Leonard: What?\\
131 - Sheldon: Oh, of course, it only works on the weak-minded.\\
132 - Scene: Penny’s bedroom.\\
133 - Leonard: Good morning, sunshine.\\
134 - Penny: Leonard. It’s eight a.m. It’s like the middle of the night.\\
135 - Leonard: I know, but I have to go to work, and I made you breakfast.\\
136 - Penny: Oh, wow, that’s so sweet. Hey, what’s this?\\
137 - Leonard: Uh, before you open that, um, are you familiar with the story of The Shoemaker and the Elves?\\
138 - Penny: Elves? Come on, Leonard. It’s too early for Lord of the Rings.\\
139 - Leonard: No, no. Listen, um, once upon a time, there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night, elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him. And when the shoemaker woke up in the morning, he, he would be super happy, not mad at the elves at all. Open it.\\
140 - Penny: Okay. An examination of the economic, cultural, and political roots of slavery in the Old South, 1619 to 1865. What the hell is this?\\
141 - Leonard: Don’t ask me. A little elf did it.\\
142 - Penny: So let me get this straight. You just assumed my paper would be bad so you wrote one for me?\\
143 - Leonard: No, I assumed it would be good. Then I read it.\\
144 - Penny: What?\\
145 - Leonard: No, I, I mean, it was good. There were just a few things that needed a little polishing.\\
146 - Penny: You changed every word.\\
147 - Leonard: That’s not true. Uh, slavery. 1619. Your name at the top. That’s all you.\\
148 - Penny: You are such an ass. This is exactly why I didn’t want to tell you I was taking a class in the first place.\\
149 - Leonard: Please don’t be upset. I just, I didn’t want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school.\\
150 - Penny: Right, because me being in school is so important to you. That way, you wouldn’t have to be dating someone who’s only a waitress.\\
151 - Leonard: Oh, come on, you know that’s not true.\\
152 - Penny: Do I? Listen to me. I need to do this on my own. If I fail, I fail. If I pass, I pass. Do you get it?\\
153 - Leonard: I’m sorry. I was just trying to help.\\
154 - Penny: Yeah, well, next time don’t. Oh, and since you like stories so much, this is not The Shoemaker\\
155 - and the Elves, okay? This is, Give a man a fish, he eats it. Teach a man to fish, he, sells it or something. Whatever, I don’t know, it’s just a lot better than what you did, you big jerk!\\
156 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
157 - Howard: You ever hear back from Hawking?\\
158 - Sheldon: No. It would appear as if I’ve lost him. Stupid brain.\\
159 - Raj: It’ll be okay.\\
160 - Sheldon: How can it be okay? Stephen Hawking’s a genius and he talks like a robot. It’s everything I’ve ever wanted in a friend.\\
161 - Raj: Yeah, but if he’s a sore loser, maybe you’re better off without him.\\
162 - Sheldon: You’re right. I guess I just have to make lemonade out of the two of you. He played! He played! Coop and Rolling Thunder are together again. He was okay with that nickname.\\
163 - Howard: So, now all you have to do is let him win.\\
164 - Sheldon: Yeah, way ahead of you. I will play the word at for two measly points, throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world.\\
165 - Howard: What are you waiting for? Hit send.\\
166 - Sheldon: I can’t. Losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest.\\
167 - Raj: So don’t do it.\\
168 - Sheldon: Oh, but I want to be Hawking’s friend.\\
169 - Howard: So do it.\\
170 - Sheldon: Oh, but if I do, I’ll be a phony, a sellout, a Hollywood poser.\\
171 - Raj: Then don’t do it.\\
172 - Sheldon: I won’t. This feels right. My mother always said, to thine own self be true.\\
173 - Howard: Good for you.\\
174 - Sheldon: ‘Course she also told me that every animal in the world got on one boat, so what does she know? And send.\\
175 - Scene: The apartment.\\
176 - Leonard: Oh, hey. Haven’t heard from you in a couple days. You still mad at me?\\
177 - Penny: Nope. I have no reason to… “B” mad at you. Minus.\\
178 - Leonard: Wow.\\
179 - Penny: That’s right. On my paper. Not yours, mine, you punk-ass elf.\\
180 - Leonard: I don’t know what to say.\\
181 - Penny: Hmm, how about, gee, Penny, you’re smarter than I thought. You may be the one in school, but I’m the one who learned a lesson. I’m so stupid, Penny. Duh.\\
182 - Sheldon: She sounds exactly like you.\\
183 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
184 - Amy: How’d it go with Leonard?\\
185 - Penny: I don’t think he’ll be making that mistake again.\\
186 - Bernadette: Good.\\
187 - Penny: So, I know this goes without saying, but if either of you tell Leonard you helped me rewrite this paper, I will beat you both with a bag of oranges.\\
188 - Amy: Understood.\\
189 - Bernadette: Got it.\\
190 - Penny: Now, ladies, we got a B-minus on this paper. I think if we put our heads together, on the next one we could get an A.\\
191 - Bernadette: Uh, but we got you a B-minus on purpose to make it believable.\\
192 - Penny: Believable? You saying I’m not smart?\\
193 - Bernadette: No, no!\\
194 - Amy: You’re smart.\\
195 - Penny: That’s better.\\
196 - Amy: I feel like I’m in high school again.\\
197 - Bernadette: Yeah, doing the prom queen’s homework so she’ll like us.\\
198 - Amy: I know. It’s finally working.\\
199 - Scene: The apartment. Sheldon’s phone rings.\\
200 - Sheldon: It’s Stephen Hawking.\\
201 - Leonard: Well answer it. I want to hear.\\
202 - Sheldon: Professor Hawking, how nice of you to call.\\
203 - Stephen Hawking: Hello. I really enjoyed our game, Dr. Cooper.\\
204 - Sheldon: Oh, me, too.\\
205 - Stephen Hawking: Or should I say Dr. Loser? Ha, ha, ha.\\
206 - Sheldon: Yes, congratulations. You won fair and square. Uh, very impressive, sir.\\
207 - Stephen Hawking: Do you like brain teasers?\\
208 - Sheldon: Oh, I love brain teasers.\\
209 - Stephen Hawking: What does Sheldon Cooper and a black hole have in common? They both suck. Neener neener.
\subsection {Episode 07: The Habitation Cohabitation}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Sheldon: Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Before we get started, I’d like to announce the winner of our design your own flag competition. But I can’t. The only entry was from GameyGamer75, and I know that was a jpeg of your buttocks. Now this week we have a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help me, I’m pleased to introduce Internet personality, former star of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the only guy I know lucky enough to be immortalized in one sixteenth scale. Set phasers to fun for my friend, Wil Wheaton.\\
3 - Wil: Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I’m happy to be here.\\
4 - Amy: Cut.\\
5 - Sheldon: What’s wrong?\\
6 - Amy: Sorry, Sheldon, you were brilliant as always. Wil, that was a little wooden.\\
7 - Wil: Wooden?\\
8 - Amy: Don’t worry, it wasn’t terrible. Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound. And action.\\
9 - Sheldon: My friend, Wil Wheaton.\\
10 - Wil: Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I’m excited to be here.\\
11 - Sheldon: So, Wil, what do you have for us first?\\
12 - Wil: Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets. Now what’s interesting about this flag…\\
13 - Amy: Cut.\\
14 - Wil: What was wrong with that?\\
15 - Amy: It’s called Fun with Flags. They’re not at half-mast, nobody died. Let’s try and keep it upbeat.\\
16 - Wil: Um, no offence, but I’ve been acting since I was a kid. I think I can handle a Web show without a lot of direction.\\
17 - Sheldon: It’s true. In 1982, Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH. You moved me.\\
18 - Amy: You’ll have to forgive me. This is my first time directing, I just want it to be good.\\
19 - Wil: So do I.\\
20 - Amy: Great. So, this time let’s try more real boy, less Pinocchio. And action.\\
21 - Wil: And cut. You realize that I’m doing this for free, right?\\
22 - Amy: Yes. And so far, we’re still not getting our money’s worth. Let’s try it again. Everybody’s having fun. And action.\\
23 - Sheldon: So, Wil, what do you have for us first?\\
24 - Wil: Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets.\\
25 - Amy: Cut.\\
26 - Wil: Problem, first-time director?\\
27 - Sheldon: Oh, none that I could see. I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do. I got goose bumps.\\
28 - Amy: He was overacting on purpose.\\
29 - Sheldon: Really? He reminded me of a young William Shatner.\\
30 - Wil: Listen, Sheldon, I’m really happy to do this for you, but not if she’s gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time.\\
31 - Amy: You gonna let him speak to me like that?\\
32 - Sheldon: Well, you’re my girlfriend and I don’t want you to be upset. Then again, Wil Wheaton’s my friend and I don’t want him to be upset. Hmm, this is a sticky wicket. (To Wil) What do you think?\\
33 - Amy: Can I speak to you for a second?\\
34 - Sheldon: I’ll be right back. Feel free to play with yourself.\\
35 - Amy: I don’t care for your friend, he’s being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave.\\
36 - Sheldon: Amy, I can’t just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He’s a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him.\\
37 - Amy: Fine. Then maybe I should go.\\
38 - Sheldon: Could you? That would solve everything. You are the best. I’ll see you at dinner tonight?\\
39 - Amy: You sure you wouldn’t rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton?\\
40 - Sheldon: Come to think of it, I would! You, little lady, are on fire.\\
41 - Credits sequence.\\
42 - Scene: Howard’s bedroom.\\
43 - Bernadette: Every time we eat dinner here, your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes.\\
44 - Howard: Don’t take it personally. She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.\\
45 - Bernadette: You ready to go?\\
46 - Howard: Yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks.\\
47 - Bernadette: I don’t understand why you keep your stuff here when there’s plenty of room at home.\\
48 - Howard: What are you talking about? All I have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer. Ooh, there’s my plaid dickie. Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents. Can you believe it?\\
49 - Bernadette: 50 cents sounds right. Let’s go.\\
50 - Howard: You know, it’s kinda late. Why don’t we just spend the night here?\\
51 - Bernadette: Because we don’t live here.\\
52 - Howard: I know.\\
53 - Bernadette: Do you? You said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment, but half the time we stay here.\\
54 - Howard: That’s not true.\\
55 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, I’m doing laundry. You want me to put anything in for you?\\
56 - Howard: There’s some underwear in the hamper.\\
57 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, good, I got that new stain stick to try out.\\
58 - Howard: Thank you, I only put it on the list two weeks ago. Okay, I see what you’re getting at. How about this weekend I’ll box up all my things and move them to our place.\\
59 - Bernadette: Thank you.\\
60 - Howard: The lightsabres are gonna look great in the living room.\\
61 - Bernadette: Or in the closet. We can decide later.\\
62 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, help, my hand’s stuck in the garbage disposal.\\
63 - Howard: Let go of whatever piece of food you’re holding.\\
64 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Are you kidding? It’s a perfectly good chicken leg.\\
65 - Scene: The apartment.\\
66 - Leonard: Hey, look who’s out after dark, like a big boy.\\
67 - Sheldon: I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton. Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet.\\
68 - Leonard: I thought you had plans with Amy.\\
69 - Sheldon: Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got huffy and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.\\
70 - Leonard: Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?\\
71 - Sheldon: Yes, quite the kerfuffle.\\
72 - Leonard: Then Amy got mad and left?\\
73 - Sheldon: Walked right out the door.\\
74 - Leonard: And you?\\
75 - Sheldon: Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.\\
76 - Leonard: Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.\\
77 - Sheldon: Why’s that?\\
78 - Leonard: Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him.\\
79 - Sheldon: You’re just repeating what I said. It’s like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.\\
80 - Leonard: Trust me, call her.\\
81 - Sheldon: Fine. It’s a shame you didn’t go to dinner with us, because the buffet you’re about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close.\\
82 - Amy (on skype): What?\\
83 - Sheldon: You’ll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you’re mad at me. Tell him you’re not mad at me. Go ahead, set him straight.\\
84 - Amy: I’m mad at you, Sheldon.\\
85 - Sheldon: Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think they’re angry, they’re really just hungry.\\
86 - Amy: I’m not hungry. Your friend insulted me, and you didn’t do anything.\\
87 - Sheldon: Precisely, I didn’t do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?\\
88 - Leonard: Keep going, buddy, you’re doing great.\\
89 - Amy: Sheldon, I’m your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. That’s it. End of story. Good night.\\
90 - Sheldon: Wow, Amy’s mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day.\\
91 - Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.\\
92 - Penny: Hey. Sorry this took so long. But you used to work here, you know how it is.\\
93 - Bernadette: Kitchen slammed again?\\
94 - Penny: No, I’m a terrible waitress, remember?\\
95 - Bernadette: So, is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow?\\
96 - Howard: Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.\\
97 - Bernadette: What’s your excuse this time?\\
98 - Howard: No excuse. It’s just, you know, I’m Jewish, and technically, we’re not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath. So this one’s on God.\\
99 - Bernadette: That might be a little more convincing if you didn’t have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.\\
100 - Howard: My religion’s kinda loosey-goosey. Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don’t wear a cross, you’re good.\\
101 - Bernadette: Howie, you promised you’d move.\\
102 - Howard: And I will.\\
103 - Penny: Yeah, right.\\
104 - Howard: I will. I’m obviously not going to live in my mother’s house for the rest of my life. I’m not a child.\\
105 - Penny: I’ve seen her burp you.\\
106 - Howard: She did not burp me. She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp. Don’t you have other tables you should be waiting on?\\
107 - Penny: Yeah, but I told you, I’m not good at my job. Bernadette, listen to me. He is never gonna leave.\\
108 - Bernadette: I’m starting to think you’re right.\\
109 - Howard: All right, I’ve had enough of this. I’m a grown man, I have a successful career, for the love of God, I’ve been to space. I will move out when I’m ready, and I don’t need anyone badgering me into it.\\
110 - Penny: Wow, excuse me.\\
111 - Howard: That was just for her benefit. I’ll move tomorrow. I love you. Don’t leave me.\\
112 - Scene: Amy’s apartment.\\
113 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Angry Amy.\\
114 - Amy: What?\\
115 - Sheldon: I’ve been thinking about what happened, and I hope this gift will make things better.\\
116 - Amy: Star Trek DVDs? Why would I want this?\\
117 - Sheldon: First of all, you’re welcome. And furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheaton’s body of work, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. Get ready for 130 hours of I told you so. (She hands him back the DVDs and slams the door) Fine. I’ll just tell you what happens. Episode one, Encounter at Farpoint. Fade in. The new Enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV. Enter Wesley Crusher, played by my buddy… (Amy opens door, grabs DVDs, slams door again) She’s hooked.\\
118 - Scene: Howard’s bedroom.\\
119 - Raj: Wow. An end of an era.\\
120 - Howard: Boy, if these walls could talk.\\
121 - Leonard: They’d say, why does he touch himself so much?\\
122 - Howard: Yeah. I can’t believe I’m not going to live here anymore. This has always been my bedroom. Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.\\
123 - Leonard: Oh, yeah. Fifth grade. Sixth grade. Seventh grade. Eighth grade. Ninth grade.\\
124 - Howard: I remember when I was five, hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy. Had some Peanut M&M’S, went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital. Came home, celebrated with a Snickers, went into my second anaphylactic shock.\\
125 - Raj: When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?\\
126 - Howard: Sometime around the third Almond Joy.\\
127 - Leonard: Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?\\
128 - Howard: Yeah, I guess. Hey, would you do me a favour? Go on ahead. I just want one last moment alone in my old room.\\
129 - Leonard: We’re not standing outside by the U-Haul while you fondle yourself.\\
130 - Howard: Fine, let’s go.\\
131 - Scene: The Cheesecake Factory Bar.\\
132 - Penny: Hey. What brings you in?\\
133 - Sheldon: Penny, if you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to have a conversation about girls.\\
134 - Penny: I had a feeling we’d have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?\\
135 - Sheldon: Penny, please, I’m on the horns of a relationship dilemma. And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19.\\
136 - Penny: And for the record, bleugh. So what are you drinking?\\
137 - Sheldon: Well, it’s been a rough day. I usually go chamomile tea, but I don’t think that’s going to cut it.\\
138 - Penny: You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.\\
139 - Sheldon: Will that calm my nerves?\\
140 - Penny: It’s calmed the pants off me a couple of times.\\
141 - Sheldon: Sold.\\
142 - Penny: Oh. So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?\\
143 - Sheldon: The trouble isn’t with me, Penny, it’s with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle.\\
144 - Penny: Yeah, Amy told me what happened. Look, just apologize. It’ll warm her twaddle.\\
145 - Sheldon: It’s a Band-Aid at best. See, the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other. Which is baffling because they’re both crazy about me. And I like them, which indicates they’re bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek.\\
146 - Penny: Honey, you can’t make people like each other.\\
147 - Sheldon: Not true. Leonard made me like you. And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe. Cheers, pal. Ooh. Boy, that is a treat that’s hard to beat. Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, I’m having a tea party.\\
148 - Penny: You might want to pace yourself.\\
149 - Sheldon: I drink tea all the time. I think I know what I’m doing.\\
150 - Penny: Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.\\
151 - Sheldon: My problem is I’m out of tea.\\
152 - Penny: Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk.\\
153 - Sheldon: Penny, please, I think I’ve evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing.\\
154 - Penny: Sorry.\\
155 - Sheldon: On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.\\
156 - Penny: Welcome to Long Island, Tex.\\
157 - Sheldon: Amy deserves better. You know, when we buy the Planter’s deluxe mix, she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don’t have to look at them. She’s a unique blend of saint and squirrel.\\
158 - Penny: Yeah, that she is. Here you go.\\
159 - Sheldon: I’m a callous egomaniac. She’s gonna leave me.\\
160 - Penny: No, she won’t.\\
161 - Sheldon: No, she won’t. I’m great.\\
162 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
163 - Howard: Okay, I have now officially moved out of my mother’s house. You are now the only woman in my life who I’ll see naked in the bathroom.\\
164 - Bernadette: I know this wasn’t easy. You doing okay?\\
165 - Howard: Oh, I’m fine. It’s just her I’m worried about.\\
166 - Bernadette: Aw, she’ll be okay. She’s a grown woman.\\
167 - Howard: I know. It’s just ever since my dad left, I’ve felt responsible for her.\\
168 - Bernadette: That’s a lot for a kid to deal with.\\
169 - Howard: She was just so sad all the time. I was the only person who could cheer her up. Well, me and Ben and Jerry.\\
170 - Bernadette: She’s lucky you were there.\\
171 - Howard: You know, she’s why I first got into magic. I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. I can still remember the way she’d smile. For a few minutes, she’d forget how lonely she was.\\
172 - Bernadette: Aw, crap. Let’s go.\\
173 - Howard: Where we going?\\
174 - Bernadette: Grab a box. We’ll sleep at your mother’s place tonight.\\
175 - Howard: No, but I want to live here.\\
176 - Bernadette: Well, you should’ve thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story.\\
177 - Howard: Can’t we talk about this?\\
178 - Bernadette: No husband of mine is gonna break his mother’s heart!\\
179 - Scene: Wil Wheaton’s house.\\
180 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Wil Wheaton! (Knock, knock, knock) Wil Wheaton! Wait, how many was that?\\
181 - Wil: Hey, Sheldon, what’s up?\\
182 - Sheldon: Wouldn’t you like to know?\\
183 - Wil: Have you been drinking?\\
184 - Sheldon: Just tea. S’the best tea I’ve ever had.\\
185 - Wil: Why are you here?\\
186 - Sheldon: I’ll tell you. I’m from Texas. Need I say more?\\
187 - Wil: Yeah, actually, a little more would be helpful.\\
188 - Sheldon: You insulted my woman. I’m here to defend her honour. Two! It was two. (Knock, knock, knock) Wil Wheaton! Now prepare yourself for what may come.\\
189 - Wil: Oh, Sheldon, do you really think we’re gonna fight?\\
190 - Sheldon: My fists are not up here because I’m milking a giant invisible cow. They’re up to beat an apology out of you.\\
191 - Wil: Okay, I’m sorry.\\
192 - Sheldon: Well, that was a long bus ride for not very much.\\
193 - Wil: Are you okay?\\
194 - Sheldon: You’re asking a lot of questions, Wil Wheaton. As a matter of idle curiosity, which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting? Never mind, I’ll choose. (Vomits) You were so good in Stand by Me.\\
195 - Scene: The apartment.\\
196 - Sheldon: Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Get ready for a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help us, I’m pleased to introduce a special guest, surprisingly, it only took gas money and the promise of free food to get him here, Mr. LeVar Burton.\\
197 - LeVar: Hey, Sheldon, it’s a pleasure to be here. Well, we’ve got some interesting flags for…\\
198 - Amy: Cut. Yikes, this guy is worse than Wil Wheaton.\\
199 - Sheldon: I don’t know what she’s talking about, but I’m obligated to agree with her. She’s my girlfriend.\\
200 - LeVar: Ah, I hear you, brother. I still get lunch, right?
\subsection {Episode 08: The 43 Peculiarity}
1 - Scene: The cafeteria. Sheldon is drawing on a napkin.\\
2 - Raj: What are you drawing over there?\\
3 - Sheldon: It’s a hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.\\
4 - Howard: Oh, you silly doodlebug.\\
5 - Leonard: You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us.\\
6 - Sheldon: It’s a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard. You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down. (Hands Howard the napkin)\\
7 - Howard: Do you expect me to build this?\\
8 - Sheldon: I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen.\\
9 - Howard: Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon always disappears every day at two forty-five?\\
10 - Leonard: Really?\\
11 - Raj: He probably just goes to the bathroom.\\
12 - Leonard: Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays.\\
13 - Raj: It’s sad that you know that.\\
14 - Leonard: Oh, that’s just the tip of the sadness iceberg.\\
15 - Howard: I’m looking at his public calendar. Two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. Yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. He never has anything booked during that time.\\
16 - Raj: Twenty minutes a day, completely unaccounted for.\\
17 - Howard: We should figure out where he goes.\\
18 - Raj: Ooh, this is exciting. Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties.\\
19 - Leonard: Right, the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life?\\
20 - Howard: Colonel Koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.\\
21 - Raj: It was tapenade and you guys suck.\\
22 - Credits sequence.\\
23 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. Penny is texting.\\
24 - Penny: So, how was work today?\\
25 - Leonard: Well, I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection.\\
26 - Penny: That sounds like fun.\\
27 - Leonard: Yeah, it was.\\
28 - Penny: Oh, good, I guessed right.\\
29 - Leonard: Who you talking to?\\
30 - Penny: Oh, just this guy I met at school.\\
31 - Leonard: Oh, great. We’re still dating, right?\\
32 - Penny: Relax. He’s just a friend. We’re doing an oral report together. He’s really nice.\\
33 - Leonard: I’m sorry, what was that? I had a little stroke after oral.\\
34 - Penny: Would you stop? Look, he just moved here from London, okay? He doesn’t really know anybody.\\
35 - Leonard: Oh, good, an English accent, the sexiest accent you can have.\\
36 - Penny: No. That’s not true. There’s French, there’s Italian. No, you’re right, it’s the best.\\
37 - Leonard: Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?\\
38 - Penny: It didn’t come up.\\
39 - Leonard: Well, maybe you should tell him.\\
40 - Penny: What am I supposed to say?\\
41 - Leonard: Say, can’t talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. England sucks, you suck, USA number one.\\
42 - Penny: Fine. Hanging with my boyfriend. Talk to you later. Happy?\\
43 - Leonard: Yes. Thank you.\\
44 - Penny: Mm-hmm. Hmm.\\
45 - Leonard: What did he say?\\
46 - Penny: Nothing.\\
47 - Leonard: What?\\
48 - Penny: Did your boyfriend make you type that?\\
49 - Leonard: I hate this guy.\\
50 - Penny: Don’t be like that.\\
51 - Leonard: Come on, trust me, he’s hitting on you.\\
52 - Penny: No, he’s not. We’re just friends. Look, is this gonna be a problem? Because he’s supposed to come over tomorrow to work.\\
53 - Leonard: Really? Here?\\
54 - Penny: If it makes you uncomfortable, I’ll switch partners, even though the thing’s due next week and everyone already has a partner and I’ll probably end up failing the class.\\
55 - Leonard: That’d be great. Thank you.\\
56 - Scene: The corridor outside Sheldon’s office.\\
57 - Howard: Two forty-four, Right on schedule. Hey, Sheldon.\\
58 - Sheldon: Oh, hello.\\
59 - Howard: Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny. Want to come with us?\\
60 - Sheldon: No, thank you.\\
61 - Raj: Are you sure? They turn off the lights, and it’s like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place.\\
62 - Sheldon: I’m quite sure. Good day.\\
63 - Howard: Well, where are you going?\\
64 - Sheldon: Where are you going?\\
65 - Raj: We just told you.\\
66 - Sheldon: I just told you.\\
67 - Howard: No, you didn’t.\\
68 - Sheldon: Well, it’s your word against mine; see you in court.\\
69 - Howard: Should we follow him?\\
70 - Raj: I don’t know, I’m torn. I want to know where he’s going, but now I kind of want to play with the bunny.\\
71 - Alex: Hi, guys.\\
72 - Howard: Hey, Alex, do you know where your boss just went?\\
73 - Alex: No.\\
74 - Howard: Don’t you know his schedule?\\
75 - Alex: All I know is corduroy makes too much noise and I have to go find quieter pants.\\
76 - Howard: Come on.\\
77 - Raj: Boy, what I wouldn’t give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish.\\
78 - Scene: A corridor in the basement. Sheldon takes out a key, unlocks a door and enters.\\
79 - Howard: This is where he goes? What’s in there?\\
80 - Raj: I think it’s an old storage room.\\
81 - Howard: What could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?\\
82 - Raj: Well, he’s not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?\\
83 - Howard: Not yet. What are you doing?\\
84 - Raj: I’m listening.\\
85 - Howard: Can’t you face the other way and listen?\\
86 - Raj: I can’t do anything right for you, can I?\\
87 - Howard: What the hell is he up to?\\
88 - Raj: He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe he’s got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.\\
89 - Howard: Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?\\
90 - Raj: Howard, please, you can’t treat the man differently just because he’s disabled. That’s not okay.\\
91 - Scene: The apartment.\\
92 - Leonard: If you’re wondering why I’ve been staring through the peephole, I’m trying to get a look at this guy who’s coming over to Penny’s.\\
93 - Sheldon: To be honest, I didn’t know you were here.\\
94 - Leonard: It’s not a big deal. He’s just in her history class. They’re working on a project together. I don’t even know why I care. You know what, I don’t care.\\
95 - Sheldon: You think you don’t care?\\
96 - Leonard: This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.\\
97 - Sheldon: Oh, I don’t know. I mean, statistically speaking, I’m sure you have something to worry about.\\
98 - Leonard: What do you mean?\\
99 - Sheldon: Well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That’s one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.\\
100 - Leonard: Well, yeah, but this isn’t just about looks. I’m, I’m way above average in a lot of other things.\\
101 - Sheldon: Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products.\\
102 - Leonard: I’m talking about important things like emotional maturity.\\
103 - Sheldon: You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.\\
104 - Leonard: I liked it better when you thought I wasn’t here.\\
105 - Sheldon: I’m not saying you don’t have attractive qualities. Your choice of friends is impeccable, you’re a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes I like. You’re a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes.\\
106 - Leonard: None of this matters. I trust that Penny cares about me, and nothing’s gonna happen with this guy.\\
107 - Sheldon: Well, unless of course he’s a skilled hypnotist.\\
108 - Leonard: What?\\
109 - Sheldon: While unlikely, it’s still a statistical possibility. She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it.\\
110 - Leonard: Now you’re just being ridiculous.\\
111 - Sheldon: Am I? The mind’s a mysterious thing, Leonard. He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she’s a chicken pecking for corn.\\
112 - Scene: The university basement.\\
113 - Raj: Look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars.\\
114 - Howard: I think we’re more like ninjas.\\
115 - Raj: I don’t want to be a ninja, I want to be a cat burglar.\\
116 - Howard: Fine, I’ll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.\\
117 - Raj: No, we both have to be the same thing. Okay, we’re ninjas.\\
118 - Howard: Thank you.\\
119 - Raj: But next time, we’ll be cat burglars.\\
120 - Howard: It’s locked.\\
121 - Raj: Are you sure?\\
122 - Howard: Yes, I’m sure. Now, you stand guard, I’m going to…\\
123 - Raj (trying door): It’s locked.\\
124 - Howard: Just keep an eye out. I’ll have this open in a minute.\\
125 - Raj: When did you learn how to pick locks?\\
126 - Howard: When I was starting to do magic in junior high, I thought I could be an escape artist like Harry Houdini.\\
127 - Raj: How did that work out?\\
128 - Howard: Pretty good. I managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius. There. Ready?\\
129 - Raj: Hold on, hold on.\\
130 - Howard: What?\\
131 - Raj: Sheldon is a very smart man, and he obviously wants to keep this a secret.\\
132 - Howard: Yeah, so?\\
133 - Raj: What if it’s booby-trapped?\\
134 - Howard: Don’t worry, I’m one step ahead of him.\\
135 - Raj: Great, what’s your pl… (Howard pushes him inside)\\
136 - Howard: Are we good?\\
137 - Raj: Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?\\
138 - Howard: I don’t know. The solution to an equation?\\
139 - Raj: Maybe. It’s a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.\\
140 - Howard: What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?\\
141 - Raj: He’s always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.\\
142 - Howard: It’s paprika.\\
143 - Raj: Really? Well, oh, okay, one mystery solved.\\
144 - Scene: The apartment.\\
145 - Voice from Outside: Okay, good night.\\
146 - Penny (off): Thanks, Cole. See you at school.\\
147 - Cole (off): See you.\\
148 - Leonard: I’ll be right back.\\
149 - Sheldon: I thought you left a long time ago.\\
150 - Leonard (rushing to catch up with Cole): ‘sup?\\
151 - Cole: Hey.\\
152 - Leonard: You, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?\\
153 - Cole: No, I was just visiting a friend.\\
154 - Leonard: Oh, cool. That cute blonde on four?\\
155 - Cole: Yeah. You know her?\\
156 - Leonard: I, well, I see her around. I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude.\\
157 - Cole: Really?\\
158 - Leonard: Yeah. He’s ganged up.\\
159 - Cole: She told me he’s a scientist.\\
160 - Leonard: That’s the name of his gang. The Scientists. They are crazy.\\
161 - Cole: Well, thanks for the tip.\\
162 - Leonard: No problem, brother. Stay frosty. (Cole leaves. Leonard spots Penny watching.) We’re still dating, right?\\
163 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
164 - Alex: Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.\\
165 - Leonard: Hey, Alex, and call me Leonard. Dr. Hofstadter is my father. And my mother. And my sister. And our cat. Although, I’m pretty sure Dr. Boots Hofstadter’s degree was honorary.\\
166 - Alex: May I join you, Leonard?\\
167 - Leonard: Sure.\\
168 - Alex: Thanks.\\
169 - Leonard: Hey, Alex, let me ask you something. My girlfriend knows this guy at school. He’s got an English accent.\\
170 - Alex: Ooh, I love English accents.\\
171 - Leonard: Yeah, you all do. Anyway, I feel like he’s hitting on her. She says he’s just being nice and that I should trust her.\\
172 - Alex: It’s probably harmless. You know how it is. I’m sure you get hit on all the time.\\
173 - Leonard: Right. Because girls are always like, ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections. I got to get me some of that.\\
174 - Alex: I don’t know, I bet it happens more than you realize.\\
175 - Leonard: Trust me, it doesn’t.\\
176 - Alex: You sure? You’re cute, you’re funny. Maybe you’re getting hit on, and you don’t even know it.\\
177 - Leonard: Really?\\
178 - Alex: Yep, pretty sure.\\
179 - Leonard (laughs): Okay, I got to get back to work. Thanks for listening.\\
180 - Alex: No problem.\\
181 - Leonard: Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.\\
182 - Scene: Raj’s office.\\
183 - Raj: Come on, we’re smart guys. We can figure this out.\\
184 - Howard: Forty-three. What is forty-three? Besides my mom’s neck size.\\
185 - Raj: It’s the atomic number for technetium.\\
186 - Howard: That stuff’s radioactive.\\
187 - Raj: Do you think he’s building a bomb?\\
188 - Howard: Ah, it took him two years to put together that Lego Death Star, I’m not worried.\\
189 - Raj: Ooh, this could be something. forty-three is the number of calories in half a cup of fat-free yoghurt.\\
190 - Howard: Why would you know that?\\
191 - Raj: I’m sorry. We can’t all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. Wait, in the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, isn’t forty-three the answer to the question of life, the universe,and everything?\\
192 - Howard: That’s forty-two, dumb-ass.\\
193 - Raj: Hey, hey. Feelings.\\
194 - Howard: We should stop. I’m exhausted.\\
195 - Raj: Yeah, me, too. We’ve got more important things to do. Who cares what stupid forty-three means?\\
196 - Howard: Not me.\\
197 - Raj: Let’s go home. You want to get something to eat?\\
198 - Howard: Sounds good.\\
199 - Raj: What the balls is forty-three?\\
200 - Howard: I have to know!\\
201 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
202 - Leonard: Hi.\\
203 - Penny: Hey, shouldn’t you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?\\
204 - Leonard: Come on, I’m sorry.\\
205 - Penny: I just can’t believe you don’t trust me.\\
206 - Leonard: I do, of course I do.\\
207 - Penny: Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?\\
208 - Leonard: Really?\\
209 - Penny: Your picture’s on my refrigerator.\\
210 - Leonard: Oh. You know, I’m really starting to not like this guy.\\
211 - Penny: What is your problem? Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?\\
212 - Leonard: I don’t know. It-it-it’s hard sometimes. Everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if I’m standing right there. And they’re all taller than me. Why is everyone taller than me? You know what, this is all in my head. It’s my problem, not yours.\\
213 - Penny: Leonard, why do you always do this? Listen to me, you’re the one I’m with. You know I love you, so will you please relax because you’re driving me crazy.\\
214 - Leonard: You know that’s the first time you ever said that you love me.\\
215 - Penny: Yeah.\\
216 - Leonard: We’re just supposed to pretend it’s not a big deal?\\
217 - Penny: That’s exactly what we’re gonna do because you’re about to make me cry, and we both know if I start crying, you’re gonna start crying.\\
218 - Leonard: You’re right, you should go.\\
219 - Penny (crying): All right.\\
220 - Leonard (crying): She loves me. (Receives text) Hey, it’s Alex. Nice having coffee with you. If you want to talk more, I’m always available. Smiley face, smiley face. What a friendly girl.\\
221 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
222 - Howard: Okay, picture’s up. Looks like the camera’s working.\\
223 - Raj: That’s good quality video.\\
224 - Howard: It better be. It’s the spare camera for the Mars rover.\\
225 - Raj: How did you get your hands on that?\\
226 - Howard: Million dollar camera, ten dollar lock.\\
227 - Raj: Oh, my God, here he comes. This is it.\\
228 - Howard: What the hell is that thing?\\
229 - Raj: I don’t know.\\
230 - Sheldon (on screen): This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Experimental log. Wormhole generator test forty-four.\\
231 - Howard: Wormhole generator test? (On screen a wormhole appears)\\
232 - Sheldon: The first forty-three parallel universes I’ve checked proved to be empty. I see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different. (Puts his head in the wormhole)\\
233 - Howard: Oh, my God!\\
234 - Raj: Holy crap!\\
235 - Sheldon (with an alien creature stuck to his face): Oh! It’s eating my face!\\
236 - Raj: Aah! It’s eating his face!\\
237 - Sheldon (throwing alien onto the laptop): I found your webcam and replaced the video feed. You two should be ashamed of yourselves.\\
238 - Raj: Sheldon, we’re really sorry.\\
239 - Howard: Yeah, really sorry.\\
240 - Sheldon: Sorry? You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to. It’s exhausting. Which is why, for twenty minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge.\\
241 - Howard: But what are you doing in there?\\
242 - Raj: And what does forty-three mean?\\
243 - Sheldon: You don’t need to know, you don’t deserve to know, and you will never know.\\
244 - Raj: Yeah, well, I know how to make your egg salad now.\\
245 - Scene: The room in the basement. Sheldon enters, takes out a box, takes a beanbag from the box, then starts playing keepie-uppie,\\
246 - Sheldon: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight… Drat. I’m never going to get to forty-three again. One, two, three, four… Rats.
\subsection {Episode 09: The Parking Lot Escalation}
1 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
2 - Leonard: They are not.\\
3 - Raj: They are, too.\\
4 - Leonard: Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data. You’re just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.\\
5 - Raj: No, you’re displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter. Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing.\\
6 - Leonard: Oh, yeah? Mummies are wrapped in bandages.\\
7 - Raj: That’s called a fashion choice.\\
8 - Leonard: All right, you brought this on yourself. Sheldon, get him.\\
9 - Sheldon: If a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie. However, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite. So, like a zombie, that’s been eaten from the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on.\\
10 - Leonard: Good boy. Here’s a cookie.\\
11 - Sheldon: Oh, thank you.\\
12 - Howard: Hey, fellas, what’s going on?\\
13 - Leonard: Oh, mummies and zombies again.\\
14 - Howard: Oh, they’re not the same thing.\\
15 - Leonard: You get a cookie, too.\\
16 - Howard: Thanks. Guess who picked up his new car this morning?\\
17 - Raj: Congratulations. Does it have that new car smell?\\
18 - Howard: Yep. For as long as I can keep my mother out of it. If you want to check it out later, it’s parked right out front, space 294.\\
19 - Sheldon: I’m sorry, 294?\\
20 - Howard: Yeah.\\
21 - Sheldon: That’s my parking spot.\\
22 - Raj: Why do you have a parking spot? You don’t have a car. You don’t even drive.\\
23 - Sheldon: It doesn’t matter. That’s my spot.\\
24 - Leonard: Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.\\
25 - Sheldon: Well, I’m not using my nipples, either. Maybe they should reassign those.\\
26 - Howard: Sheldon, someday, if you get a car, I’m sure they’ll give you another parking space.\\
27 - Sheldon: I don’t want another parking space. I want my parking space. It’s perfect. It’s a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. It’s a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks.\\
28 - Howard: Fun story. Meanwhile, you still don’t have a car.\\
29 - Sheldon: Don’t try to change the subject. This is about a parking space. It has nothing to do with cars.\\
30 - Howard: Are you listening to yourself?\\
31 - Sheldon: I always listen to myself. It’s one of the great joys of my life. Now, get your car out of my spot.\\
32 - Howard: Nope.\\
33 - Sheldon: Very well. You leave me no choice.\\
34 - Scene: The parking spot. Sheldon is trying to push Howard’s car out of the spot.\\
35 - Sheldon: What are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?\\
36 - Credits sequence.\\
37 - Scene: The apartment.\\
38 - Sheldon (on phone): President Siebert, listen to reason. Yeah, I understand I don’t use the parking spot, but that’s not the point. I… Yes, I’m aware you told me not to call you at home, but you didn’t answer the door. And I know you were there, because I saw you through the mail slot. Yeah, well, that’s some salty language. May I remind you that you’re the president of a major university, not the president of the Potty Mouth Club. There it is again. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? Oh, well, I’m sorry for your loss. Good night, sir. Unbelievable. He says Wolowitz deserves my spot because he’s a high-profile asset to the university.\\
39 - Leonard: Well, he’s not wrong. Howard did go to the International Space Station.\\
40 - Sheldon: Yeah, that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?\\
41 - Leonard: Sheldon, let it go. It’s not a big deal.\\
42 - Sheldon: No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard. It starts with a parking space, where does it end? It’s like my dad always said, first they say you can’t drink and drive, next thing you know, you can’t let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat.\\
43 - Leonard: All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.\\
44 - Sheldon: Leonard, you’re my best friend. Why don’t you ever take my side?\\
45 - Leonard: Because I can never understand your side.\\
46 - Scene: Sheldon’s office.\\
47 - Howard: Give it back.\\
48 - Sheldon: I’m sorry, but could you be more specific?\\
49 - Howard: My Iron Man helmet. Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.\\
50 - Sheldon: Oh, that. Well, see, I wanted it, and you weren’t using it. Apparently, those are the rules we live by now. Payback, it truly is the B word, isn’t it?\\
51 - Howard: Sheldon, that is a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible, and I want it back.\\
52 - Sheldon: I’d love to help you out, but unfortunately (puts helmet on), I’m using it.\\
53 - Howard: Fine. I’m taking your diploma.\\
54 - Sheldon: Go ahead. That’s the only doctorate you’ll ever get. It smells funny in here.\\
55 - Scene: The apartment stairwell.\\
56 - Bernadette: We’re so proud of you, Amy. Your first bikini wax.\\
57 - Penny: Yeah. So, how you doing?\\
58 - Amy: A little sensitive, but not bad. Does it always take that long?\\
59 - Penny: Uh, no, they usually don’t have to go out and get more wax.\\
60 - Amy: I feel like I’m five pounds lighter.\\
61 - Bernadette: Really? Only five?\\
62 - Penny: Hey, anybody want a drink?\\
63 - Amy: Sure.\\
64 - Bernadette: Okay. So, did you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight, too?\\
65 - Amy: For hours. Fortunately, I couldn’t understand most of it ’cause Sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask.\\
66 - Bernadette: Howard was so angry I had to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep.\\
67 - Amy: I guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males. At some point, they’re bound to lock horns.\\
68 - Penny: I’m assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at Comic-Con?\\
69 - Bernadette: I’m really sorry they took Sheldon’s spot away. He shouldn’t have to suffer just because Howard’s such a big deal now.\\
70 - Amy: I know, Sheldon should just let Howard have his little moment in the sun.\\
71 - Bernadette: What’s that supposed to mean?\\
72 - Amy: Well, I mean, Howard’s never gonna go to space again, but Sheldon will always be a genius.\\
73 - Bernadette: You’re right. And I’m sure Sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again, if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science.\\
74 - Amy: If and when?\\
75 - Penny: Okay, maybe we should change the subject. Um, Amy, how are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?\\
76 - Bernadette: Hang on. None of Sheldon’s theories have ever been definitively proven. My husband actually went to outer space.\\
77 - Amy: That’s an impressive accomplishment. He’s now an inspiration to millions of Americans who know you don’t have to be special or even qualified to go into space.\\
78 - Penny: You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax. My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape. It’s a bad idea.\\
79 - Bernadette: Gosh, Amy. I’m sensing a little hostility. Is it maybe because, like Sheldon’s work, your s*x life is also theoretical?\\
80 - Penny: Damn.\\
81 - Amy: Yeah, well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won’t be thinking about his mother. And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard’s lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb.\\
82 - Penny: Anyway, to this day, I still can’t see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.\\
83 - Bernadette: I don’t have to take this. I’m gonna go home and have s*x with my husband right now. Maybe I’ll let him do it to me in the parking spot. Which sounds dirty, but I didn’t mean it that way,\\
84 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
85 - Raj: Okay, here’s another one: If a zombie bites a vampire, and the vampire bites a human, does the human become a vampire or a zombie? Or a zompire?\\
86 - Leonard: Sheldon?\\
87 - Sheldon: Cookie.\\
88 - Leonard: I don’t have any.\\
89 - Sheldon: Well, I’m not giving it away. (Enters apartment. Howard is sitting naked in his spot with a laptop on his lap)\\
90 - Howard: Hi Sheldon.\\
91 - Sheldon: He’s in my spot. Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot.\\
92 - Leonard: Howard, what are you doing?\\
93 - Howard: He wasn’t using it. And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.\\
94 - Sheldon: Get off there.\\
95 - Howard: Give me back my Iron Man helmet.\\
96 - Sheldon: Give me back my parking space.\\
97 - Howard: You don’t need a parking space. You don’t have a car.\\
98 - Sheldon: You don’t need an Iron Man helmet. You’re not Iron Man.\\
99 - Howard: Well, we appear to have reached an impasse. And you know, I have to say, I thought you’d be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk.\\
100 - Raj: I didn’t pick up on that. That’s a nice touch.\\
101 - Leonard: Mmm.\\
102 - Scene: The parking spot. Sheldon is spraypainting out Howard’s name and replacing it with his own.\\
103 - Amy: This is so exciting. I’m feeling all tingly. Although that could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone.\\
104 - Sheldon: Keep a lookout. This place is swarming with campus security. They will not hesitate to scold us.\\
105 - Amy: Freaking pigs.\\
106 - Sheldon: Oh, yeah. Okay, now, pull your car into the spot and let’s get out of here.\\
107 - Amy: Wait, I’m leaving my car here?\\
108 - Sheldon: Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake. Really makes these things tough to budge.\\
109 - Amy: Before I park, come in the back seat. I want to show you something I had done today.\\
110 - Sheldon: All right, colour me intrigued.\\
111 - Amy: What do you think?\\
112 - Sheldon: I think you’re high on paint fumes. And boy, that’s a lot of Band-Aids.\\
113 - Scene: Amy and Howard’s apartment.\\
114 - Penny: Okay, Howard’s mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos.\\
115 - Bernadette: What can I tell ya? She’s a big girl. Wherever you look, there she is. More coffee?\\
116 - Penny: No, Leonard’s taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee’ll just keep me awake. (Knock on door) Oh, I’ll get it.\\
117 - Amy: Oh, looks like someone’s on Team Bernadette. Where’s Howard?\\
118 - Bernadette: He’s not here. What’s wrong?\\
119 - Amy: He had my car towed. It cost me two hundred dollars to get it back.\\
120 - Bernadette: Oh, no. Where was it parked?\\
121 - Amy: In Sheldon’s spot.\\
122 - Bernadette: That doesn’t make sense. Sheldon doesn’t have a spot. Was it maybe in Howard’s spot?\\
123 - Amy: Don’t play dumb with me, sister. You tell your husband he owes me two hundred dollars.\\
124 - Bernadette: Well, that doesn’t make sense, either.\\
125 - Amy: Why not?\\
126 - Bernadette: Because I’m the one who had it towed.\\
127 - Amy: You?\\
128 - Bernadette: Didn’t see that one coming, did ya?\\
129 - Amy: Oh, yeah? Well, you’re not gonna see this coming. (Swings handbag. Bernadette ducks. Penny is hit in the face)\\
130 - Penny: Ow! Ow!\\
131 - Amy: Oh, my God,\\
132 - Bernadette: Are you okay?!\\
133 - Penny: You idiot, what the hell do you have in there?!\\
134 - Amy: Just my wallet, keys and a coffee can full of change I’ve been meaning to take to the bank.\\
135 - Bernadette: Don’t move. I’ll get some ice.\\
136 - Amy: Are you okay?\\
137 - Penny: Get away from me or I swear to God I will rip out what’s left of your pubes!\\
138 - Bernadette: Here.\\
139 - Penny: Thanks. Ah!\\
140 - Bernadette: Amy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand?\\
141 - Penny: Gee, you think?\\
142 - Amy: I do. Penny, Bernadette and I are sorry.\\
143 - Bernadette: You hit her! What did I do?\\
144 - Amy: You had my car towed.\\
145 - Bernadette: You were parked in Howard’s spot.\\
146 - Amy: I was parked in Sheldon’s spot.\\
147 - Bernadette: Sheldon doesn’t have a spot.\\
148 - Penny: Guys, I think I need to go to the emergency room.\\
149 - Bernadette: Okay, let’s go.\\
150 - Amy: I’ll drive. You can see where the tow truck scratched my car.\\
151 - Bernadette: The tow truck didn’t scratch your car.\\
152 - Amy: How do you know?\\
153 - Bernadette: ‘Cause I did it!\\
154 - Scene: The parking spot. Sheldon has set up his office in it.\\
155 - Sheldon: Morning, Professor Stevens. Don’t look at that whiteboard. That’s my math, not your math. Keep walking, nosey.\\
156 - Howard: What the hell are you doing?\\
157 - Sheldon: Oh. You said I’m not using my space, so I’m using it.\\
158 - Howard: Okay, you need to move now.\\
159 - Sheldon: No, I don’t.\\
160 - Howard: You can’t stay there forever.\\
161 - Sheldon: Actually, I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says I can. Give up, Wolowitz. You’ve chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can’t defeat. There is nothing you could possibly do to… (Howard starts sounding his horn. Sheldon puts on earphones)\\
162 - Howard: Those aren’t gonna help you, Sheldon,\\
163 - Sheldon: Oh, yes, they are. I mean, what?\\
164 - Howard: I’m warning you, Sheldon!\\
165 - Sheldon: Your threats are empty, nothing can move me. (Howard starts pushing his chair with the front of the car) Stop that.\\
166 - Howard: Get out of my spot.\\
167 - Sheldon: No. That’s it. I am calling campus security. You prepare for the scolding of your life.\\
168 - Leonard: What are you idiots doing?\\
169 - Sheldon: He’s trying to kill me, Leonard. Video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence.\\
170 - Howard: Would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?\\
171 - Leonard: You’re both acting like lunatics. It’s just a parking spot.\\
172 - Howard: It’s not just a parking spot. He can’t handle the fact that I’m a bigger deal than he is now.\\
173 - Sheldon: Oh, preposterous. I have been solely responsible for this university’s six loop quantum gravity calculations, I have changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates, and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine. Maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have work to do.\\
174 - Howard: Can you believe this guy?\\
175 - Leonard: What I don’t believe is that you tried to run him over.\\
176 - Howard: Oh, like you’ve never thought of doing that. Don’t hate me just because I lived the dream. (Horn beeps. Sheldon is sitting naked in Howard’s car.) \\
177 - Sheldon: Hey, sweet ride.\\
178 - Howard: What are you doing in there?\\
179 - Sheldon: Just breaking in your new car.\\
180 - Howard: Stop that. You stop that.\\
181 - Sheldon: You know what they say? Revenge is a dish best served nude.\\
182 - Scene: Sheldon’s office.\\
183 - Raj: Hey, got a minute?\\
184 - Sheldon: Oh, of course, come in. (Raj opens door to reveal Howard) This is an authentic Chinese throwing star, and I must warn you, I have seen many people throw them in movies.\\
185 - Raj: Calm down. Howard has something he wants to say to you.\\
186 - Howard: All right. Sheldon, when this whole thing with the parking space started, I had no idea just how much of a crazy b*st*rd…\\
187 - Raj: Howard, that’s not how we practiced it.\\
188 - Howard: I had no idea how much that spot meant to you. Anyway, I called President Siebert and told him it’s not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and I’ll park in the structure across the street.\\
189 - Sheldon: Well, Howard, thank you. It’s quite a gesture on your part. You’ve shown yourself to be the bigger man.\\
190 - Howard: Thank you.\\
191 - Sheldon: Which I find totally unacceptable. I must be the bigger man. Therefore, you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile.\\
192 - Howard: Wow, okay. Well, thanks. I don’t know what to say.\\
193 - Sheldon: There is nothing to say. Except I’m the bigger man. I’m not kidding. Say it.\\
194 - Raj: Just say it.\\
195 - Howard: You’re the bigger man, Sheldon.\\
196 - Sheldon: Oh, stop. And I believe this is yours. FYI, if you wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground.\\
197 - Scene: The cheesecake factory.\\
198 - Howard: I’d like to propose a toast, to burying the hatchet.\\
199 - Sheldon: To burying the hatchet.\\
200 - Bernadette: You know, I’m kind of glad this happened.\\
201 - Amy: Me, too. In some weird way, I kind of feel like it brought us closer.\\
202 - Penny (with two black eyes and a plaster across her nose): Yeah, everybody’s happy, great.\\
203 - Scene: A dry cleaners.\\
204 - Shopkeeper: Can I help you?\\
205 - Sheldon: Yes. According to information I gleaned from Yelp, you had great success when a santeriasuzy37 brought you a pair of leather slacks stained with chicken blood. I believe I may have a similar problem. This cushion experienced a nude revenge wiggle.\\
206 - Shopkeeper: A what?\\
207 - Sheldon: A naked man sat on it. Now, here’s my concern, his diet is rich in fatty deli meats. What test do you have to detect lipid residue?\\
208 - Shopkeeper: Lipid what?\\
209 - Sheldon: Lipid residue. An a**l autograph. A colon calling card, if you will.\\
210 - Shopkeeper: Tuesday okay?\\
211 - Sheldon: Don’t rush it. We may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level.\\
212 - Shopkeeper: Let me write you a ticket.\\
213 - Sheldon: Is that your son?\\
214 - Shopkeeper: Uh-huh.\\
215 - Sheldon: Looks like that laptop’s seen better days. If you’re interested, I’m selling this. It’s only two years old, 16 gigabytes of RAM, Intel core i7 processor, and I can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut’s pen1s.
\subsection {Episode 10: The Fish Guts Displacement}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Sheldon: Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?\\
3 - Leonard: Why would it trouble you? It’s, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song.\\
4 - Sheldon: It is, right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget., and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, heroes in a half-shell.\\
5 - Howard and Raj (together): Turtle power!\\
6 - Sheldon: However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that Spider-Man, Spider-Man does whatever a spider can.\\
7 - Howard: Yeah, so?\\
8 - Sheldon: I can think of many things Spider-Man can’t do that a spider can. One, crawl in your ear and die. Two, legally leave Guatemala without a passport. Three, have s*x with a spider.\\
9 - Raj: an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.\\
10 - Howard: It’s heebie-jeebies.\\
11 - Raj: I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic. Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme, movies that killed their franchises.\\
12 - Leonard: Oh. Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.\\
13 - Raj: Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous. I mean, you know a movie’s bad when my homegirl Sandy B can’t save it.\\
14 - Leonard: Penny’s working tonight, I’m in.\\
15 - Howard: Not me. I’m having dinner with Bernadette and her parents.\\
16 - Leonard: Fun. We know how much you love that.\\
17 - Howard: It’s torture. Especially with her dad. We have nothing in common.\\
18 - Sheldon: You know what I like to do when I’m forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? I bring up an interesting topic, like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders.\\
19 - Howard: Thanks, Sheldon. I’ll try that with my father-in-law.\\
20 - Sheldon: No, you can’t use that one. That’s mine. Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker. Uh, despite popular lore, there is no place in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in China.\\
21 - Howard: Great, thank you.\\
22 - Sheldon: Actually, you can’t have that one either. It’s too good. Sorry.\\
23 - Raj: What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?\\
24 - Sheldon: Sadly, yes. Amy’s taking me to a memorial service. It’s for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he’ll never make his way back to China.\\
25 - Leonard: That should lighten the mood.\\
26 - Sheldon: What can I say? I put the fun in funeral.\\
27 - Credits sequence.\\
28 - Scene: Amy’s apartment.\\
29 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Oh, right, funeral. (Knock, knock, knock) (solemnly) Amy.\\
30 - Amy: Hello, Sheldon.\\
31 - Sheldon: I’m not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?\\
32 - Amy: I think I’m too sick to go to the funeral.\\
33 - Sheldon: You’re sick? You poor kid. Well, see ya.\\
34 - Amy: Sheldon, aren’t you gonna take care of me?\\
35 - Sheldon: Me? No. No, I’m not that kind of doctor.\\
36 - Amy: But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them.\\
37 - Sheldon: Oh, no, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I’m ill. When you’re feeling better, you’ll think that’s funny.\\
38 - Amy: Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.\\
39 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this. Additionally, you are my girlfriend, and I care about your well-being.\\
40 - Amy: Thank you, Sheldon.\\
41 - Sheldon: You’re welcome. Now let’s get this over with.\\
42 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment. \\
43 - Howard: So, how have you been?\\
44 - Mr. Rostenkowski: Fine.\\
45 - Howard: Good. Fine is good. How you liking retirement?\\
46 - Mr. Rostenkowski: It’s fine.\\
47 - Howard: I’m sensing a theme. You ever really think about the Spider-Man theme song? How’s that dinner coming?\\
48 - Bernadette: I just put it in. It’s gonna be a while.\\
49 - Howard: I like rare chicken. Let’s do this.\\
50 - Bernadette: You could die.\\
51 - Howard: Death by chicken. That’s a pretty fowl way to go.\\
52 - Mrs. Rostenkowski: Here’s another beer, honey.\\
53 - Mr. Rostenkowski: Thank you.\\
54 - Howard: So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand Canyon. How was it?\\
55 - Mrs. Rostenkowski: It was good.\\
56 - Howard: Had no idea you were the chatty one.\\
57 - Scene: Amy’s apartment.\\
58 - Sheldon: 102.2. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It’s like you’re not even trying to get better.\\
59 - Amy: Sheldon, you don’t get over the flu in half an hour.\\
60 - Sheldon: Well, not with that attitude.\\
61 - Amy: I have to say, I’m finding your bedside manner a little lacking.\\
62 - Sheldon: I’m sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?\\
63 - Amy: Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its validity.\\
64 - Sheldon: Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath.\\
65 - Amy: Sheldon, this isn’t helping. Why don’t you just let me get some rest.\\
66 - Sheldon: How can you sleep? I’m not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.\\
67 - Amy: You, you want to rub something on my chest?\\
68 - Sheldon: Yes. All over it.\\
69 - Amy: Maybe we should start with that.\\
70 - Sheldon: Now you’re being a responsible patient. Now, you may notice some tingling.\\
71 - Amy: Oh, I’m counting on it.\\
72 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
73 - Howard: Okay, dig in.\\
74 - Mr. Rostenkowski: Hold up. Bless us, O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord. Amen.\\
75 - Howard: Took the words right out of my mouth.\\
76 - Bernadette: So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?\\
77 - Mr. Rostenkowski: I’m going next weekend.\\
78 - Howard: Oh, you like to fish?\\
79 - Mr. Rostenkowski: Yes.\\
80 - Howard: Sure. I can hear it in your voice.\\
81 - Mrs. Rostenkowski: Oh, if he didn’t like it, he wouldn’t go.\\
82 - Howard: You know, I hadn’t thought of that. (To Bernadette, whispering) Help me.\\
83 - Bernadette: Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime. Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better.\\
84 - Howard: No, no. We know each other well enough. He’s been talking my ear off all night.\\
85 - Bernadette: Howie, I think you’d have fun.\\
86 - Mr. Rostenkowski: Fine, you can tag along.\\
87 - Bernadette: Terrific. My two favorite fellas gone fishin’.\\
88 - Howard: Well, hang on a second, Bernie. Next weekend, we have that thing.\\
89 - Bernadette: What thing?\\
90 - Howard: You know, the thing.\\
91 - Bernadette: Oh, that thing. No, I cancelled that thing.\\
92 - Mr. Rostenkowski: All right, it’s settled. You and I are going fishing.\\
93 - Howard: Great. (To Bernadette) Thanks for the help.\\
94 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
95 - Howard: I’ve never even been fishing. This is gonna be a disaster.\\
96 - Raj: If you don’t want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I’ll give you a hint. You can see them here, here and here.\\
97 - Leonard: Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give you some pointers.\\
98 - Howard: Do either of you guys know how to fish?\\
99 - Leonard: No.\\
100 - Raj: No. But if you catch anything, I know how to steam it in banana leaves.\\
101 - Howard: Come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this.\\
102 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
103 - Penny: S’up?\\
104 - Scene: The apartment.\\
105 - Penny: Step one, worms.\\
106 - Howard: Ew!\\
107 - Penny: Okay, right there, ew is one of the things you’re not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. It’s right up there with icky and get it away. Now pick one up.\\
108 - Howard: Really?\\
109 - Penny: You’re gonna have to do it when you’re fishing.\\
110 - Howard: Okay.\\
111 - Penny: What are you waiting for?\\
112 - Howard: I don’t know, for them to die of natural causes.\\
113 - Penny: Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.\\
114 - Howard: Fine. There.\\
115 - Leonard: I’m no expert, but I think the hook has to go through the worm.\\
116 - Howard: Fine. Sorry, Mr. Worm. Sherm. Sherm the Worm.\\
117 - Penny: Hey, don’t name him. Just jab a hook in his face.\\
118 - Raj: You got this, buddy.\\
119 - Leonard: Yeah, come on, Howard. Hook that worm.\\
120 - Raj: You can do it.\\
121 - Penny: That’s great. Cheerleading, way to man things up.\\
122 - Scene: Amy’s apartment. \\
123 - Sheldon (reading): And the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. But, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. The end.\\
124 - Amy: That was great. Rub my chest again. (Knock at door) \\
125 - Sheldon: No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up. (Opens door)\\
126 - Bernadette: How’s the poor thing?\\
127 - Sheldon: Oh, I’m hanging in there. Thanks for asking.\\
128 - Bernadette: Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but there’s a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts.\\
129 - Sheldon: Uh, I’m going to draw you a soothing bath. Where’s your bath thermometer?\\
130 - Amy: I don’t have a bath thermometer.\\
131 - Sheldon: Fine. Then I’m going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.\\
132 - Bernadette: This is a really good expectorant. Although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music.\\
133 - Amy: Okay, okay, here’s the deal. I don’t need your medicine. I’m not sick.\\
134 - Bernadette: I don’t understand.\\
135 - Amy: I got better two days ago. It’s just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.\\
136 - Bernadette: So you’ve just been lying to him?\\
137 - Amy: See the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.\\
138 - Bernadette: I don’t mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.\\
139 - Amy: All right. I’ll tell him.\\
140 - Sheldon (off): Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?\\
141 - Amy: I’ll tell him tomorrow. Mama needs a bath.\\
142 - Scene: The apartment.\\
143 - Penny: Now, let’s assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish. You’re going to have to know how to gut it. So, what you’re going to do is you’re going to take your knife, slice him right up the belly. (Howard gags) You want me to stop?\\
144 - Howard: No, I’m fine. Keep going.\\
145 - Penny: All right. Now, you don’t want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face. (Howard, Leonard and Raj gag) Oh, my God. What is with you guys?\\
146 - Leonard: It’s not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us.\\
147 - Penny: What, never?\\
148 - Leonard: My dad was an anthropologist. The only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy. I hated that kid.\\
149 - Raj: Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored, I’d put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating.\\
150 - Howard: Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday.\\
151 - Raj: Yeah, okay, Howard wins.\\
152 - Leonard: You know, maybe we didn’t have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there’s a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip.\\
153 - Howard: You’re right. Oh! I should do this.\\
154 - Penny: Great. Here you go. What you’re going to do is you’re going to stick your thumb down its throat, grab the guts and pull.\\
155 - Howard: Here we go. Oh!\\
156 - Penny: Oh, look, it’s a female. You can see all the eggs. (All the guys gag)\\
157 - Scene: Amy’s apartment. Amy is dancing to “Walking on Sunshine”. Hears door and turns off stereo.\\
158 - Amy: Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you’re back. Taking a turn for the worst. I think I’m going to need another bath.\\
159 - Sheldon: I’m surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren’t recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.\\
160 - Amy: Oh?\\
161 - Sheldon: I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire.\\
162 - Amy: All right, all right. But I really was sick at the beginning. It’s just been so nice having you take care of me.\\
163 - Sheldon: It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour.\\
164 - Amy: I feel terrible I did this.\\
165 - Sheldon: It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future.\\
166 - Amy: I suppose that’s fair. What do you suggest?\\
167 - Sheldon: In a perfect world, I’d lock you in a stockade in the public square. That probably requires a permit.\\
168 - Amy: I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.\\
169 - Sheldon: Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn’t kill a man. You know, it’s a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.\\
170 - Amy: Are you saying you want to spank me?\\
171 - Sheldon: I don’t want to. But it looks like you left me no choice.\\
172 - Amy: That’s true. I’ve been a very bad girl.\\
173 - Scene: Bernadette’s parents’ garage. \\
174 - Howard: Hi-ho, hi-ho, it’s off to fish we go.\\
175 - Mr. Rostenkowski: That’s what you’re wearing?\\
176 - Howard: No good? The guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear.\\
177 - Mr. Rostenkowski: Maybe in cartoons.\\
178 - Howard: Wish I had known that before I posted all those pictures on Facebook.\\
179 - Mr. Rostenkowski: All right, let’s hit the road. I wouldn’t mind shooting some ducks in the morning.\\
180 - Howard: Wait, now we’re shooting things?\\
181 - Mr. Rostenkowski: I like using a big shell. You can’t eat them afterwards, but it’s fun watching them blow up.\\
182 - Howard: Sir, I’m flattered that you invited me, and I really want you to like me, but I don’t think this trip is the way to do it. And I can’t return these things if there’s chunks of duck all over them.\\
183 - Mr. Rostenkowski: So, why’d you agree to come?\\
184 - Howard: ‘Cause Bernadette made me.\\
185 - Mr. Rostenkowski: I tried to back out, too. My wife said I had to go.\\
186 - Howard: Really? Your wife makes you do stuff? You’re a big, scary cop.\\
187 - Mr. Rostenkowski: You’re an astronaut, and your wife makes you do things, and she’s only four feet tall.\\
188 - Howard: So, what do we do now? They expect us to go away for the weekend.\\
189 - Mr. Rostenkowski: Ah. There’s an Indian casino near Palm Springs. You know how to shoot craps?\\
190 - Howard: No, but I’m not a stranger to dice games. I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion.\\
191 - Mr. Rostenkowski: Mazel tov. I’ll teach you how to play.\\
192 - Howard: Really? Thank you, sir.\\
193 - Mr. Rostenkowski: Call me Mike.\\
194 - Howard: Okay. Oh, boy, we’re just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, Mike?\\
195 - Mr. Rostenkowski: That’s my wife and daughter you’re talking about.\\
196 - Howard: Great couple of gals.\\
197 - Mr. Rostenkowski: I wouldn’t go that far.\\
198 - Scene: Amy’s apartment. \\
199 - Sheldon: Are you prepared to receive your punishment?\\
200 - Amy: One second. I want to put on some music.\\
201 - Sheldon: Why?\\
202 - Amy: I don’t want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.\\
203 - Sheldon: Very well, then. Get over my knee. Let’s begin.\\
204 - Amy: Oh, my.\\
205 - Sheldon: Excuse me. You’re not supposed to be enjoying this.\\
206 - Amy: Then maybe you should spank me harder.\\
207 - Sheldon: Maybe I will.\\
208 - Amy: Ooh!
\subsection {Episode 11: The Santa Simulation}
1 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
2 - Penny: Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs.\\
3 - Leonard: Look at that, I built a fireplace with my own two hands.\\
4 - Penny: You’re so butch.\\
5 - Leonard: Aw, I got a little paper cut.\\
6 - Penny: Of course you did. Your hands are softer than veal.\\
7 - Leonard: Oh, before I forget, Saturday I’m planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys.\\
8 - Penny: Really? That’s how you’re gonna spend your Saturday night?\\
9 - Leonard: Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore.\\
10 - Penny: Oh, you poor thing. Is having a real-life girlfriend who has s*x with you getting in the way of your board games?\\
11 - Leonard: Little bit, yeah.\\
12 - Scene: The apartment.\\
13 - Amy: Oh, great! I’ve always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons.\\
14 - Sheldon: Yeah, oh, I’m sorry. I should’ve mentioned this earlier. You’re not invited.\\
15 - Amy: Why not?\\
16 - Sheldon: Amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves.\\
17 - Amy: By rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?\\
18 - Sheldon: Yeah, like a bunch of savages.\\
19 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment. Bernadette is on the webcam.\\
20 - Bernadette: Saturday night? But I’ve been working late all week. That was gonna be our night.\\
21 - Howard: But I have to go. We play as a group. If-if I’m not there, then everyone will blame you. They’ll be all, Bernadette ruined everything. She’s the worst. So, you see? I have to play Dungeons and Dragons for the marriage.\\
22 - Bernadette: You’re an idiot.\\
23 - Howard: I’m your idiot. Forever.\\
24 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
25 - Raj: So, listen, I know we talked about getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake, and then seeing the Christmas lights in Griffith Park, but Leonard’s talking about a big D and D game at his place.\\
26 - Stuart: Saturday night just went from crazy to epic. Woo-hoo!\\
27 - Credits sequence.\\
28 - Scene: The apartment.\\
29 - Leonard: All right, Sheldon, to start our quest you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you.\\
30 - Sheldon: A Christmas gift? You know I don’t enjoy Christmas.\\
31 - Stuart: What’s wrong with Christmas?\\
32 - Sheldon: Oh, where to begin? Trees indoors. Overuse of the words ’tis and ’twas. And the absurd custom of one stocking. Everyone knows socks belong in pairs. Who uses one sock?\\
33 - Howard:Pirate with a peg leg?\\
34 - Sheldon: Actually that helps, thank you.\\
35 - Leonard: Would you just look inside?\\
36 - Sheldon: Oh, a scroll. I like scrolls. They’re my third favourite system of transmitting the written word. After stone tablets and skywriting. You have all been summoned to join a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure. Your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred. I like where this is heading. Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres. Oh, that’s a saucy twist. That leader’s name, Santa Claus. No, no, no.\\
37 - Leonard: It’s actually ho, ho, ho, but you’ll get the hang of it. Thought it’d be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme.\\
38 - Sheldon: Fun? Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly, the best-tasting jelly, and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly.\\
39 - Leonard: Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in the smoking remains of Santa’s village. Clearly, a great battle has taken place.\\
40 - Raj: Oh, man, the first monster I see, I’m gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand, and shoot my magic all over his ass.\\
41 - Stuart: Do you hear yourself when you say these things?\\
42 - Leonard: Okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow. Sheldon, what do you do?\\
43 - Sheldon: I signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove Christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy.\\
44 - Leonard: Fine. Howard, what do you do?\\
45 - Howard: I follow the ogre tracks, checking for secret doors along the way.\\
46 - Leonard: And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.\\
47 - Howard: Okay, guys, let’s make a plan, spell casters in the back, warriors in the front.\\
48 - Raj: No, screw that noise, I’m going in. Hang on, Santa, I’m coming for you.\\
49 - Leonard: Okay, you run into a room full of weapons, hit a trip wire, a cannon blows your face off, you die, you’re out of the game.\\
50 - Raj: But, a cannon? Am I really out of the game?\\
51 - Sheldon: Lucky.\\
52 - Leonard: Okay, come on, moving on.\\
53 - Raj: Wait, doesn’t anyone have a rod of resurrection? Because if you’ve got one, I need it bad. Get in here with your rod and give it to me.\\
54 - Stuart: Okay, you need to say these things in your head before you say them out loud.\\
55 - Penny (entering): Hey, guys. I don’t mean to interrupt your little game, but I thought you’d like to see what you’re missing out on. So, Bernadette? Bernadette’s wearing leopard-print pumps and a rack-tastic red dress from Forever 21. And there’s Amy, showing all kinds of ankle. In an outfit I’m assuming is from Forever 63. And I, myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty.\\
56 - Sheldon: I know they’re making a rhetorical point, I just don’t know what it is.\\
57 - Penny: See you, boys. We are going drinking.\\
58 - Raj: Uh, wait, can I come with you? My character died.\\
59 - Bernadette: Sorry, Raj, it’s girls’ night out.\\
60 - Amy: Maybe another time.\\
61 - Leonard: Okay…\\
62 - Penny: Come on.\\
63 - Raj: Ooh! Girls’ night, girls’ night! Ooh! Ooh!\\
64 - Stuart: How does he not hear that?\\
65 - Scene: A bar.\\
66 - Amy: So, what’s the plan? Are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk, luring strange men into the bathroom, and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses?\\
67 - Bernadette: No!\\
68 - Penny: No!\\
69 - Amy: Geez, who’s Forever 63 now?\\
70 - Raj: Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table? Don’t worry. It’s my treat.\\
71 - Amy: Thanks.\\
72 - Penny: Wow, you should come to girls’ night more often. And not just because if you weren’t here, this would be a can of Pabst.\\
73 - Raj: My pleasure, nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady. Just ask my dog. My vet says if I give her any more foie gras, she’s going to die of gout.\\
74 - Bernadette: Hey, let’s help Raj meet a girl tonight.\\
75 - Raj: No, no, no, I’m fine.\\
76 - Penny: Okay, wait, are we talking one-night stand or do we want to get him into a relationship?\\
77 - Amy: Let’s get him laid!\\
78 - Raj: Stop it. You’re ruining girls’ night.\\
79 - Penny: Raj, you’re a great guy, you’re in a bar full of single women, let us help you.\\
80 - Bernadette: Yeah, you’re a real catch. I know you’re shy, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have someone wonderful in your life.\\
81 - Raj: That’s sweet of you. But what can you do to help?\\
82 - Bernadette: We’ll nose around, see if we can find a nice girl, and then introduce you.\\
83 - Raj: Okay. Well, a couple of things. Don’t tell them I come from money. I want them to love me for me. They must be insanely hot. Like, nines or tens.\\
84 - Penny: Nines or tens?\\
85 - Raj: Okay, an eight is acceptable if she’s willing to bring another eight to the hot tub.\\
86 - Bernadette: Bottom line, you’ll take any woman who’ll have you, right?\\
87 - Raj: In a New Delhi minute.\\
88 - Scene: The apartment.\\
89 - Stuart: I don’t remember you buying these miniatures in my store.\\
90 - Leonard: Oh, uh, yeah. I got ‘em on Amazon.\\
91 - Stuart: Sure. I get it. Why support a friend when you can support a multinational conglomerate that is crushing the life out of that friend?\\
92 - Leonard: I know, but when I shop online, I can do it on the toilet.\\
93 - Stuart: Have you seen my store? The whole place is a toilet.\\
94 - Howard: Can we please move this along?\\
95 - Leonard: Yeah, sorry. Uh, you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest. What do you do? And, Howard, do not say, I feel up the large chest.\\
96 - Howard: Excuse me, I’m a married man now. I wasn’t going to say anything so juvenile.\\
97 - Leonard: Great. What do you do?\\
98 - Howard: I walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go “blublublublublublublublu”\\
99 - Sheldon: I open the chest.\\
100 - Leonard: It’s locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in.\\
101 - Stuart: That’s not good. My character and I both have claustrophobia.\\
102 - Leonard: Glowing letters appear on the chest that read, If squashed to death you wish not to be, sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory.\\
103 - Howard: Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav?\\
104 - Leonard: Walls are getting closer.\\
105 - Stuart: Oh, boy, happy place, happy place.\\
106 - Sheldon: Wait, Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia.\\
107 - Leonard: You’re ten seconds away from getting crushed. Nine, eight.\\
108 - Howard: What are we supposed to do?\\
109 - Leonard: Seven, six.\\
110 - Sheldon: Wait, wait. Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol.\\
111 - Howard: Never heard of it. Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy.\\
112 - Leonard: Three, two.\\
113 - Stuart: Somebody sing the damn song.\\
114 - Sheldon: Good King Wenceslas looked out, on the feast of Stephen. When the snow lay ’round about, deep and crisp and even\\
115 - Leonard: The walls are getting slower.\\
116 - Sheldon: Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel. When a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel.\\
117 - Leonard:The walls stop. You’re safe.\\
118 - Howard: That was amazing, Sheldon.\\
119 - Stuart: How did you know that?\\
120 - Sheldon: It was simple. I combined a well-known historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents, Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop, singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos.\\
121 - Leonard: Okay, continuing our quest.\\
122 - Sheldon: W-W-Wait. There’s still four more verses. You don’t sing a song and not finish it. Hither, page, and stand by me, if thou know’st it, telling. Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling? Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost…\\
123 - Scene: The bar. \\
124 - Bernadette: Looks like he’s doing pretty good.\\
125 - Penny: Of course he is. Look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend. She’s angry, she’s drunk, and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire. I mean.\\
126 - Amy: That is some low-hanging fruit.\\
127 - Bernadette: Oh, here he comes.\\
128 - Penny: So, how’d it go?\\
129 - Raj: Great. I bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her e-mail address.\\
130 - Penny: Ooh!\\
131 - Bernadette: Jennifer at not-even-if-you-were-the-last-guy-on-earth dot loser.\\
132 - Raj: What?\\
133 - Bernadette: I’m sorry, Raj.\\
134 - Raj: Why can’t I find someone? I’m smart, I’ve got a cool job, and my naturally bronzed complexion means I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can’t.\\
135 - Penny: Oh, honey, it’s not you, it’s them.\\
136 - Raj: No, it’s not. She was too beautiful for me.\\
137 - Bernadette: Why would you say that?\\
138 - Raj: It’s true. I’m always attracted to women I can’t have. I do it all the time. I did the same thing with the two of you.\\
139 - Amy: The two of them? I don’t understand.\\
140 - Raj: Well, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny, and I thought she was into me, too, because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me. But apparently I misread those signals.\\
141 - Amy: And you liked Bernadette also?\\
142 - Raj: That was before Penny. I make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends’ girlfriends at a time. I’m very old-fashioned that way.\\
143 - Amy: So at, uh, some point, you probably had a thing for me, too.\\
144 - Raj: No, not really.\\
145 - Penny: Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?\\
146 - Raj: Not that I can think of.\\
147 - Bernadette: Think harder.\\
148 - Raj: Nope. I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. Or in this case, doesn’t, I mean, at all. What?\\
149 - Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is still singing.\\
150 - Sheldon: Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing. Ba-da-bum.\\
151 - Howard: Done?\\
152 - Sheldon: I think the word you’re looking for is bravo.\\
153 - Leonard: Okay, you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen.\\
154 - Sheldon: Melted snowmen? Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?\\
155 - Leonard: I don’t know. What’s the difference?\\
156 - Sheldon: Well it’s a game of the imagination, Leonard. Paint a picture.\\
157 - Leonard: Fine. You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.\\
158 - Sheldon: What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?\\
159 - Leonard: You see those, too.\\
160 - Sheldon: Oh, it’s like I’m really there.\\
161 - Stuart: I gotta tell you, this, this is the most holiday fun I’ve had since my therapist changed my anxiety medication and I stopped caring about the blood in my stool.\\
162 - Howard: Good story.\\
163 - Leonard: What are you drinking there? A little eggnog?\\
164 - Sheldon: Yes. What, is there a problem?\\
165 - Leonard: No, it’s nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmassy.\\
166 - Sheldon: Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink? Eggs are available all year ’round. I’ve been known to enjoy this poolside.\\
167 - Leonard: Come on, Sheldon. You know all the Christmas stories, and the carols, you’ve got an eggnog moustache going on there. Just admit it. You’re getting a little Yuletide spirit.\\
168 - Sheldon: Oh, don’t be silly. Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry. Why is this so important to you?\\
169 - Leonard: Honestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and I’m tired of you sucking the joy out of them now.\\
170 - Stuart: What was so bad about them?\\
171 - Leonard: I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning, you could tell he’d been there because the paper would be graded.\\
172 - Sheldon: No wonder you love Christmas. That sounds amazing.\\
173 - Leonard: It wasn’t amazing. I got a C-minus four years in a row.\\
174 - Sheldon: Yeah, I’m familiar with your work. C-minus was your gift.\\
175 - Scene: The bar.\\
176 - Raj: Amy, I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you.\\
177 - Amy: It’s fine. I’m used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice. I didn’t have my first kiss till I was 22, and the guy only did it so I’d give him back his insulin.\\
178 - Bernadette: Sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants.\\
179 - Amy: Forget it. I don’t expect you guys to understand.\\
180 - Raj: I understand. In seventh grade, I played Spin the Bottle and it landed on Alina Shankar. She said if I came near her, she would break the bottle and cut me.\\
181 - Amy: You think that’s bad? In college, I passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on.\\
182 - Raj: Sometimes I get so lonely, I sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I put it in my right hand and pretend I’m holding hands with another person.\\
183 - Amy: I do that, too. Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel. And I let it.\\
184 - Raj: It’s kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone.\\
185 - Amy: It is, isn’t it?\\
186 - Raj: But you’re not alone anymore. Now you’ve got Sheldon.\\
187 - Amy: I do. And don’t worry, someday you’ll have somebody, too.\\
188 - Raj: Thank you. I hope she’s half as lovely and amazing as you are.\\
189 - Amy: Thank you, Rajesh. He wants me, I’m good. We can go now.\\
190 - Raj: Damn it.\\
191 - Penny: What?\\
192 - Raj: Now that I know she doesn’t like me, I’m kind of into her.\\
193 - Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is writing numbers on a whiteboard.\\
194 - Sheldon: All right. I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.\\
195 - Howard: Great. Let’s do it. (They pick up bells and play according to the numbers. The tune is Jingle Bells)\\
196 - Leonard: The drawbridge is lowering.\\
197 - Stuart: My carpal tunnel’s acting up.\\
198 - Sheldon: Play through the pain.\\
199 - Leonard: You did it. The drawbridge is down. You cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room. And in the corner, chained to the wall, you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus. He says, ho, ho, help me.\\
200 - Howard: Yes, we found Santa. Christmas is saved. Don’t ever tell my mother I said that.\\
201 - Stuart: I take out my skeleton key and run to Santa to unchain him.\\
202 - Sheldon: But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard.\\
203 - Howard: Wait, what are you doing?\\
204 - Sheldon: You can’t talk, you’re paralyzed. I get right up in Santa’s big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again. Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas, when I was five years old, isn’t that right?\\
205 - Leonard: Uh, okay.\\
206 - Sheldon: My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas. And I told you, my Pop-Pop, because that was the year my grandfather died. I missed him and I wanted him back.\\
207 - Leonard: This is weird, right?\\
208 - Sheldon: Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. But you didn’t bring him back, did you? No, instead, I got Lincoln Logs. Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs, but Pop-Pop ain’t one of ‘em. And now you’re here asking me for something, to save you. Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but today’s not your day. I’m leaving you here to rot, and I hope the ogres feast on your bones. I take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!\\
209 - Leonard: Okay. So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa’s dead, and I picked this over having s*x with my girlfriend.\\
210 - Scene: The apartment, late at night. \\
211 - Sheldon: Santa?\\
212 - Santa: Oh, hello, Sheldon. You should be asleep.\\
213 - Sheldon: Well, then, you shouldn’t have jingle bells on your boots.\\
214 - Santa: Oh. I’ve been wanting to talk to you. I’m sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy. I can do a lot of magical things, but unfortunately bringing your Pop-Pop back isn’t one of them.\\
215 - Sheldon: I understand.\\
216 - Santa: But I do have something special for you. Close your eyes.\\
217 - Sheldon: Oh, I hope it’s a train.\\
218 - Santa: Oh, it’s better than a train.\\
219 - Sheldon: Two trains?\\
220 - Santa: Better.\\
221 - Sheldon: I’m getting three trains.\\
222 - Santa: Okay, open ‘em. (It’s a cannon, pointed at Sheldon) This is for leaving me in the dungeon to be eaten alive by ogres!\\
223 - Sheldon: Wait, uh, uh, hang on. In my defense…\\
224 - Santa: Ho, ho, ho, ya big dork. (Fires cannon)
\subsection {Episode 12: The Egg Salad Equivalency}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Sheldon: Well, I must say, Leonard, when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga, I was sceptical.\\
3 - Leonard: I can’t blame you. Tiny Twister was a complete bust.\\
4 - Sheldon: No, I was wrong. The looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice. I’ve never felt so alive. (Answers door) Oh, hello, Alex. Uh, let me go get you last night’s recordings.\\
5 - Leonard: What recordings?\\
6 - Sheldon: Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep? Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, it’s probably pure gold. So I started recording it all, and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call Sheldon After Dark.\\
7 - Alex: Hey, Leonard.\\
8 - Leonard: Hey. Just playing a little Giant Jenga here.\\
9 - Alex: Oh, I know, I’m the one who had to buy him the helmet. So, do you have any plans this weekend?\\
10 - Leonard: Well, most of Saturday’s gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we’re done. How about you?\\
11 - Alex: Oh, I’m gonna go see Kip Thorne give a lecture on subatomic space-time.\\
12 - Leonard: Ooh. That’s his take on John Wheeler’s quantum foam. That should be great.\\
13 - Alex: Well, if you want, you can come with me.\\
14 - Leonard: Ah, I’d love to, but I’m supposed to hang out with Penny.\\
15 - Alex: Well, bring her.\\
16 - Leonard: Well, she’s not really into that kind of stuff.\\
17 - Alex: Yeah, okay. Well, if you want to hear about the lecture, I can tell you all about it at work, or, you know, over dinner sometime.\\
18 - Leonard (jumping and knocking over the Jenga): What?\\
19 - Sheldon: Jenga, I win!\\
20 - Credits sequence.\\
21 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
22 - Howard: Oh, come on, that can’t be true.\\
23 - Raj: I did the research. Tony the Tiger, Dig’em the Frog, Cap’n Crunch, Toucan Sam, Count Chocula, Trix the Rabbit, Snap, Crackle and Pop. Not one cereal mascot is a girl. It’s a total breakfast sausage fest.\\
24 - Leonard: Are we done with this?\\
25 - Raj: Almost. Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee, I believe his name is Buzz.\\
26 - Leonard: Terrific. Something weird happened and I don’t know what to do about it.\\
27 - Howard: What’s going on?\\
28 - Leonard: Sheldon’s assistant asked me on a date last night.\\
29 - Raj: How could you do that to me? You know I’ve been working it with Alex for weeks.\\
30 - Leonard: Working it? You can’t even talk to her.\\
31 - Raj: I talk with my eyes.\\
32 - Howard: You look like my little cousin when he’s dropping one in his diaper.\\
33 - Leonard: She knows I have a girlfriend. It’s so weird.\\
34 - Raj: Oh, my God. You’re loving this.\\
35 - Leonard: To my bones. I mean, I’m not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny. It’s just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods.\\
36 - Raj: I both hate you and want to be you. This is Ryan Gosling all over again.\\
37 - Sheldon: Ah, gentlemen, what is on the conversational menu this morning?\\
38 - Raj: Leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well I was only six to eight months away from making my move.\\
39 - Leonard: I didn’t steal anyone.\\
40 - Raj: Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.\\
41 - Sheldon: Well, that’s not acceptable. I mean, I’m her boss. She needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality.\\
42 - Leonard: I’m androgynous?\\
43 - Sheldon: Oh, please. Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips.\\
44 - Leonard: What do you guys think I should do?\\
45 - Raj: I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny, I provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good.\\
46 - Scene: Amy’s apartment.\\
47 - Sheldon: I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. Uh, in the past, I’ve reached out to each of you individually, but I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group, which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts I have dubbed Sheldon Cooper’s Council of Ladies.\\
48 - Penny: What is happening?\\
49 - Sheldon: I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation. Uh, to protect those involved, I’ll be changing their names.\\
50 - Bernadette: Who’s involved?\\
51 - Sheldon: Well, a short, bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate. Let’s call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally.\\
52 - Penny: You’re talking about Leonard.\\
53 - Sheldon: No, no, Shilly-Shally has red hair and, uh, he briefly served in the Mexican Navy. Anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend, Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady.\\
54 - Amy: It’s your assistant Alex, isn’t it?\\
55 - Sheldon: No. No. No. This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.\\
56 - Penny: Wait, what the hell’s going on with Leonard and Alex?\\
57 - Sheldon: No, uh, no, I’m sorry. Who’s talking about Leonard and Alex?\\
58 - Penny: Fine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.\\
59 - Sheldon: Okay, look, it’s not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya. It is really about her boss, who doesn’t quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice, which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm, he’s usually pretty smart about these things.\\
60 - Penny: I’m gonna kill her.\\
61 - Bernadette: I’m sure you’ve got nothing to worry about. Leonard would never cheat on you.\\
62 - Amy: She’s right. But say the word, I got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose. One of them could end up in the backseat of her car. Or her shower.\\
63 - Sheldon: Ladies, ladies, please. We’re not here to talk about Penny, okay? We’re here to talk about me. Uh, I mean Einstein Von Brainstorm. Oh, darn it! All right, I guess the cat’s out of the bag. Let me explain what’s going on. Ricardo is really Leonard.\\
64 - Penny: We know what’s going on, Sheldon!\\
65 - Sheldon: Well, what should I do?\\
66 - Bernadette: Well, Alex is your employee. If she’s doing something that’s making Leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her.\\
67 - Sheldon: Oh, no, he’s not uncomfortable at all. No, he’s loving it. Yeah, he’s strutting around like he’s five-foot-six.\\
68 - Penny: What? He’s loving it?\\
69 - Bernadette: Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away.\\
70 - Sheldon: Talk to her? That’s all you’ve got? With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper’s Council of Ladies, I really expected more. Give me back the T-shirts.\\
71 - Scene: Sheldon’s office.\\
72 - Sheldon: Alex, check my schedule. What does my afternoon look like?\\
73 - Alex: I think it’s pretty wide open. Oh, wait. Here’s something at four o’clock. Give Alex a talking to?\\
74 - Sheldon: Well, that snuck up on us, didn’t it?\\
75 - Alex: Is there a problem?\\
76 - Sheldon: Let’s not call it a problem. Let’s call it an opportunity. To solve a serious problem.\\
77 - Alex: What did I do?\\
78 - Sheldon: You don’t know? Oh, you poor dear. Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don’t even know which way is up. You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.\\
79 - Alex: What? I didn’t make a sexual advance on anybody.\\
80 - Sheldon: Now, there’s no need to get defensive. I’m not unsympathetic to your plight. My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.\\
81 - Alex: What?\\
82 - Sheldon: Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.\\
83 - Alex: This conversation is making me uncomfortable.\\
84 - Sheldon: Yeah, you and me both, sister. Now, please understand, I don’t hold you responsible for your behaviour because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you’re a slave to your desire to reproduce. But during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? Let’s see here. Oh, yes. Check out this oozy doozy.\\
85 - Alex: I have to go.\\
86 - Sheldon: So does this fellow, but he can’t without it burning like hot soup.\\
87 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
88 - Leonard: Hey, pretty lady.\\
89 - Penny: Oh, you seem extra happy.\\
90 - Leonard: Uh, I guess I am.\\
91 - Penny: Any particular reason why?\\
92 - Leonard: I don’t know, just having a good day. This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so I got to listen to the radio. That was pretty crazy.\\
93 - Penny: Mm-hmm. Anything else?\\
94 - Leonard: Mm. I found this quiz online called Which Star Trek Character Are You? and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.\\
95 - Penny: That’s great.\\
96 - Leonard: Oh. It. Was.\\
97 - Penny: Hmm. Well, I’m glad you’re having such a great day.\\
98 - Leonard: Yeah. And the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.\\
99 - Penny: Oh, and who’s that?\\
100 - Leonard: What do you mean?\\
101 - Penny: Oh, I just didn’t know if you meant me or Alex.\\
102 - Leonard: Um, why would I mean Alex?\\
103 - Penny: Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it.\\
104 - Leonard: What?\\
105 - Penny: Don’t play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!\\
106 - Leonard: I’m missing something. (Enters apartment. To Sheldon) Did you say something to Penny about Alex?\\
107 - Sheldon: Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you.\\
108 - Leonard: Why would you do that?\\
109 - Sheldon: I needed advice about a woman. I would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it’s that you can’t tell a uterus from a unicycle.\\
110 - Leonard: At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.\\
111 - Sheldon: Good to know. Yeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies. (Answering phone) Hello. I see. Uh, what time? Very well, then. Huh. That was the Human Resources Department at the university. Apparently, my assistant Alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace.\\
112 - Leonard: Oh, my God, what did you do?\\
113 - Sheldon: Hmm, let me think. Nothing. I’m a delight.\\
114 - Scene: The Human Resources Department.\\
115 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Human Resources Department. (Knock, knock, knock) Human Resources Department. (Knock, knock, knock) Human Resources Department.\\
116 - HR Woman: Come in.\\
117 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
118 - HR Woman: Ah, Dr. Cooper, have a seat.\\
119 - Sheldon: Thank you.\\
120 - HR Woman: I called you in today because your assistant Alex Jensen has lodged a complaint against you.\\
121 - Sheldon: So I’ve been told. But I can’t understand what she has to complain about. I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. There’s string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that’s for anyone. Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.\\
122 - HR Woman: Cancel my next appointment. This is gonna take a while. Dr. Cooper, you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace.\\
123 - Sheldon: Like what?\\
124 - HR Woman: Well, according to Ms. Jensen, you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an egg salad sandwich. I don’t even know what that means, but I’m gonna go ahead and tell you you can’t say it.\\
125 - Sheldon: Oh! I see the confusion here. No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out. No. I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? Even you. You’re a slave.\\
126 - HR Woman: I’m a what?\\
127 - Sheldon: Well, y-you, I-I’m just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman’s menstrual cycle…\\
128 - HR Woman: Whuh-ah! Woah! You can’t talk about that, either, Dr. Cooper. Your language is entirely inappropriate, and I’m gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now.\\
129 - Sheldon: I don’t see why I’m the one being persecuted here. Dr. Hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen. You know, and Howard Wolowitz, he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted s*x robot. Oh, and at the office Christmas party, I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as Brown Sugar.\\
130 - HR Woman (writing): Hofstadter… Wolowitz… and the last one was Rajesh Koothrappali?\\
131 - Sheldon: Yes. No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn’t racist. He’s also brown.\\
132 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. Penny answers the door. Leonard is playing his cello outside.\\
133 - Leonard (singing): I’m sorry Alex hit on me, hit on me, hit on me. I’m sorry Alex hit on me, I’d no idea I’m cute.\\
134 - Penny: Oh, damn it, you are.\\
135 - Leonard: Please forgive me. I should have told you about Alex.\\
136 - Penny: I don’t care about Alex. Fine, I care. Okay, I hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean, do I need to be worried?\\
137 - Leonard: Of course not. No. Why?\\
138 - Penny: Because, she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesn’t have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.\\
139 - Leonard: You do that?\\
140 - Penny: No.\\
141 - Leonard: Hang on. Are you feeling insecure? Because that’s my thing, and if you take it away, I don’t know what I’m bringing to this relationship.\\
142 - Penny: Yes, Leonard, I am insecure. Happy?\\
143 - Leonard: No, I’m not happy.\\
144 - Penny: Why are you smiling?\\
145 - Leonard: I’m sorry. I just never think of you having feelings like that.\\
146 - Penny: Well, I do.\\
147 - Leonard: Why? Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex.\\
148 - Penny: Good.\\
149 - Leonard: Come here. Tell you a secret?\\
150 - Penny: What’s that?\\
151 - Leonard: With all these women chasing me, I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk.\\
152 - Penny: Can I tell you a secret?\\
153 - Leonard: Sure.\\
154 - Penny: Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and we’re all gonna stop.\\
155 - Leonard: Message received. Ah, excuse me. (Answering phone) Hello. This is Dr. Hofstadter. Okay. All right, thank you. That’s weird. I’m getting called in to Human Resources.\\
156 - Penny: What did you do?\\
157 - Leonard: I don’t know.\\
158 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.\\
159 - Howard: Huh. I just got called in to Human Resources.\\
160 - Bernadette: Why?\\
161 - Howard: I don’t know.\\
162 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
163 - Raj: Huh. That is so strange. Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow. (To his dog) Could you stop licking your ass for two minutes? I have a problem here.\\
164 - Scene: Human Resources department.\\
165 - Howard: Do you really think you should be drinking right now?\\
166 - Raj: How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?\\
167 - Howard: I don’t know. Seek professional help?\\
168 - Raj: I did. The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.\\
169 - Howard: Wait, you got called in, too? What is going on?\\
170 - Leonard: Sheldon threw us all under the bus.\\
171 - Howard: Oh.\\
172 - Raj: I feel like I’ve been called down to the principal’s office. Although I wouldn’t mind if Brown Sugar suspended me. From a s*x swing. This may have been a mistake.\\
173 - Howard: Relax. Everything’s gonna be fine. Before I met Bernadette I was in here every other day. Uh, little tip, turn off your I Like Big Butts ringtone before you go in.\\
174 - Raj: Well, this is all your fault.\\
175 - Leonard: How is this my fault?\\
176 - Raj: If you weren’t screwing around with Sheldon’s assistant, none of this would be happening.\\
177 - Leonard: I wasn’t screwing around with anyone.\\
178 - Raj: Oh, of course not. She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles.\\
179 - HR Woman: Ah, Mr. Wolowitz, it’s been a while.\\
180 - Howard: Hey, Janine. How are Tom and the kids?\\
181 - Janine: Fine. You must be Dr. Hofstadter.\\
182 - Leonard: Yes, but I think this is all a big misunderstanding.\\
183 - Raj: Yeah, yeah, me, too. I didn’t do anything.\\
184 - Janine: Is that alcohol on your breath?\\
185 - Raj: Howard built a s*x robot.\\
186 - Howard: That is not true. All I did was build a robot.\\
187 - Janine: Did it have six breasts?\\
188 - Howard: I’m sorry, I’m a feminist, I don’t notice things like how many breasts a robot has.\\
189 - Sheldon: Well, hello.\\
190 - Leonard: What are you doing here?\\
191 - Sheldon: Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.\\
192 - Janine: And I’m a little busy right now.\\
193 - Sheldon: But I came to file a complaint. Somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.\\
194 - Janine: And who was that?\\
195 - Sheldon: You, you dirty birdie. I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized I’m deeply offended. Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.\\
196 - Janine: That’s it. All of you, in my office now!\\
197 - Sheldon: And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if you’re menstruating. And based on your behaviour, I don’t have to.\\
198 - Scene: Sheldon’s office.\\
199 - Sheldon: It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive, and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology.\\
200 - Alex: Thank you, Dr. Cooper.\\
201 - Sheldon: Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn’t happen in the future.\\
202 - Alex: Okay.\\
203 - Sheldon: Yeah. Now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so, um, I’m gonna need you to take it for me. Oh, and, uh, you’d better ace it, they’re pretty mad.\\
204 - Scene: The apartment.\\
205 - Penny: So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.\\
206 - Leonard: Oh, would you stop worrying about that?\\
207 - Penny: I can’t help it. But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something about it. So I got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes.\\
208 - Leonard: That’s great.\\
209 - Penny: No, it isn’t, they are extremely boring. I mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day? Anyway, I decided I don’t need to be a scientist, I could just look like one. So I bought these.\\
210 - Leonard: Glasses? I really don’t think that’s gonna change… oh, my God, you look so smart and hot.\\
211 - Penny: I know, right? Watch this. Molecules.\\
212 - Leonard: Okay, come with me.\\
213 - Penny: Where are we going?\\
214 - Leonard: To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses. And maybe the boots.
\subsection {Episode 13: The Bakersfield Expedition}
1 - Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is steaming a Star Trek uniform.\\
2 - Leonard: Hey, will you steam my uniform next?\\
3 - Sheldon: Interesting. Do you recall this conversation? Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer? No, Sheldon, we don’t need a steamer. Looks like that rumpled chicken’s come home to roost.\\
4 - Penny: Hi. Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.\\
5 - Leonard: Oh, thanks, I thought I had more.\\
6 - Penny: Damn, you’ve got more makeup than I do. You’ve got better makeup than I do. Yeah, I’m borrowing this.\\
7 - Leonard: Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my Comic-Con makeup. I love you, but there are some things a man doesn’t share with his girlfriend.\\
8 - Sheldon: That’s a wise policy. I once borrowed my sister’s makeup for a costume contest. Got a terrible case of pinkeye. But luckily, I was going as a zombie. I won second place.\\
9 - Penny: I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.\\
10 - Leonard: That was San Diego Comic-Con. This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.\\
11 - Penny: Is that better?\\
12 - Leonard: Well, it’s a lot smaller. It’s more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.\\
13 - Sheldon: So to answer your question, no, it’s not better.\\
14 - Penny: Well, then why are you going?\\
15 - Sheldon: It’s a comic book convention. You know, it’s like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one’s still pretty good.\\
16 - Penny: All right. Well, you guys have fun. I guess I’ll see you Sunday night.\\
17 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
18 - Penny: Okay.\\
19 - Leonard: Oh, hang on a second. (Hands her the day’s newspaper) Hold this. (Photographs the two of them together)\\
20 - Penny: What was that for?\\
21 - Leonard: To show people when they don’t believe me.\\
22 - Credits sequence.\\
23 - Scene: A restaurant.\\
24 - Penny: Oh, this is the best. You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday, you got a problem. You do it on the weekend, you got brunch.\\
25 - Amy: Sheldon doesn’t believe in brunch. He can’t stand being at a table where one person’s having an omelette and another person’s having a sandwich.\\
26 - Bernadette: He’s not exhausting at all.\\
27 - Penny (receiving text): Oh. It’s Leonard. He says they’re on the road and headed for Bakersfield at warp speed. Maybe it’s the mimosa, but I’m gonna give the kid an LOL.\\
28 - Bernadette: It’s cute how excited they are. You should have seen Howard sewing his costume all week for the convention.\\
29 - Amy: When did Howard learn to sew?\\
30 - Bernadette: When he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his mom’s pants out.\\
31 - Amy: I don’t even understand why they go to these conventions.\\
32 - Penny: I know. The four of them work at a major university. They’re all super smart. How can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?\\
33 - Bernadette: I don’t mind it. I think Howie’s just in touch with his inner child. Although when he comes to bed in his Batman pyjamas, sometimes it feels like I’m touching his inner child.\\
34 - Amy: It’s probably because they were bullied growing up. In a world where you can’t fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment.\\
35 - Penny: Mmmm. Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids. Although, in my defence, if Danny Biffle didn’t want to eat a mouthful of dirt, he shouldn’t have shown up to school wearing a bow tie.\\
36 - Bernadette: I’ve never even read a comic book. You guys?\\
37 - Penny: Uh-uh.\\
38 - Amy: No.\\
39 - Bernadette: I mean, it’s such an important part of their lives. Maybe we should try reading some.\\
40 - Amy: Seriously?\\
41 - Bernadette: The comic book store isn’t far from here.\\
42 - Penny: That is an amazing idea. Okay, how many of these have I had?\\
43 - Scene: Leonard’s car.\\
44 - Sheldon: I think you should turn on the GPS.\\
45 - Leonard: It is on.\\
46 - Sheldon: But the turn-by-turn voice option isn’t on. I know I’d feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. I love the turn-by-turn voice option.\\
47 - Howard: Has it really only been ten miles?\\
48 - Leonard: I’m turning it on, but just to shut you up.\\
49 - GPS (in Sheldon’s voice): Leonard, bear left and continue on Interstate 210.\\
50 - Sheldon: Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he’s talking about. I’d put on my listening ears if I were you.\\
51 - Leonard: What did you do?\\
52 - Sheldon: I found a hack online. I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS.\\
53 - Raj: That is so cool.\\
54 - Leonard: Counterpoint, no, it’s not.\\
55 - GPS: Continue on Interstate 210 for five miles. Here’s an interesting fact about interstates.\\
56 - Leonard: Really?\\
57 - Sheldon: Shh, he said it’s interesting.\\
58 - GPS: Interstates are numbered as follows. Even-numbered routes run east and west, odd-numbered routes run north and south. Three-digit route numbers indicate bypasses or spurs.\\
59 - Howard: Look, Leonard, there’s a bridge. Drive off it.\\
60 - Raj: You know, we’re not that far from Vazquez Rocks.\\
61 - Sheldon: Oh, they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there.\\
62 - Howard: We’ve got our costumes in the trunk. We could go there and have a little photo shoot.\\
63 - Raj: Great idea. I haven’t had a carbohydrate in two weeks. These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and they’re gone.\\
64 - Leonard: Yeah, that sounds fun.\\
65 - Sheldon: Oh, smashing. Now, Leonard, do you know how to get there?\\
66 - Leonard: No.\\
67 - Sheldon: Yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does.\\
68 - GPS: Recalculating. While we’re waiting, do you know which president signed the Intestate Highway System Act into law? The answer, coming up in 14 miles.\\
69 - Sheldon: None of you will get it. It’s Eisenhower.\\
70 - Scene: The comic book store.\\
71 - Bernadette: Why are they staring?\\
72 - Amy: Who cares? Just soak it in. Hello, boys.\\
73 - Stuart: Oh, hey. Could you please stop staring? They’re just girls. It’s nothing you haven’t seen in movies or in drawings.\\
74 - Penny: Hey, Stuart.\\
75 - Stuart: What brings you guys here?\\
76 - Bernadette: We were looking for a recommendation about comic books.\\
77 - Stuart: Oh, well, I recommend you don’t open a store and sell them.\\
78 - Penny: No, we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much, so we thought we’d give it a try.\\
79 - Stuart: Oh, okay. What do you think you might be into? Superhero, fantasy, graphic novels, manga… I swear I will turn a hose on you.\\
80 - Bernadette: What kind of comics do the guys like?\\
81 - Stuart: Um, a little bit of everything. Mostly superhero stuff.\\
82 - Amy: All right, well, who’s the best superhero?\\
83 - Stuart: Shh! You can’t ask a question like that in here. Are you trying to start a rumble?\\
84 - Penny: Well then, what do you recommend?\\
85 - Stuart: Well, uh, let’s see. You’ve got your basic clean-cut good guys, Superman, Spider-Man, Captain America. Then you have your darker anti-heroes, your Batman, your Wolverine, Punisher.\\
86 - Amy: Ooh, I do love a bad boy.\\
87 - Penny: As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.\\
88 - Stuart: If I were you, I’d go for Fables number one. The artwork is sophisticated, it’s intelligently written, and it doesn’t objectify or stereotype women.\\
89 - Penny: Ooh, Thor! He’s hot.\\
90 - Stuart: Yeah, he kind of is.\\
91 - Scene: Vasquez Rocks. Sheldon, dressed as Data, is having his makeup put on by Raj, dressed as Worf.\\
92 - Raj: And we’re blending, and we’re blending, and we’re done.\\
93 - Sheldon: I know Mr. Data isn’t supposed to smile, but here it comes.\\
94 - Howard (dressed as a Borg): Come on, guys. Let’s do this.\\
95 - Leonard (dressed as Captain Picard): Yeah, I’m sweating my bald cap off.\\
96 - Howard: So what’s our first pose going to be?\\
97 - Raj: I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.\\
98 - Leonard: I’ll set the timer.\\
99 - Howard: Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?\\
100 - Sheldon: Mr. Data’s weapon is his mind. I’m wielding it.\\
101 - Raj: Phasers on the Borg! Charlie’s Angels.\\
102 - Howard: Okay, what’s next?\\
103 - Raj: Now let’s do some sexy glamour shots. I’ll set the mood. (Rhythmically) Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, Yeah, nice one, oontz, oontz. That’s right. Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz…\\
104 - Howard: Oh, my God. Leonard, someone’s stealing your car!\\
105 - Leonard: What? Hey, hey! Come back here!\\
106 - Raj: Stop!\\
107 - Sheldon: Stealing is against the law!\\
108 - Leonard: I don’t believe this.\\
109 - Howard: Son of a bitch.\\
110 - Raj: I’ll call 911. What, oh, no, my phone is in my other pants.\\
111 - Howard: Oh, so is mine.\\
112 - Leonard: Mine, too. Anybody got any ideas?\\
113 - Sheldon: Nope. The only thing left to do now is assign blame. (To Raj) Nice going.\\
114 - Scene: The side of the road.\\
115 - Leonard: What kind of a person steals another person’s car in broad daylight?\\
116 - Sheldon: What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?\\
117 - Leonard: I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali’s fault.\\
118 - Sheldon: You’re right. Nice going.\\
119 - Howard: Car.\\
120 - Raj: What is wrong with people? Why don’t they stop?\\
121 - Sheldon: Maybe we’re better off. What if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?\\
122 - Leonard: Look at us, Sheldon. We’re the crazy people.\\
123 - Sheldon: Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence.\\
124 - Howard: Good idea. Why don’t you get started on that?\\
125 - Leonard: Come on, let’s just start walking. There’s got to be a gas station or something nearby.\\
126 - Sheldon: What, you think just because you’re wearing a captain’s uniform, you’re in charge?\\
127 - Leonard: Yes.\\
128 - Sheldon: All right.\\
129 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
130 - Penny: Hmm, okay, I’m done. How did you guys finish so fast?\\
131 - Bernadette: I don’t know, there were a lot of pictures, and one page only had the word brakkadoom!\\
132 - Penny: Yeah, well, I have street smarts.\\
133 - Bernadette: So, what’d you guys think?\\
134 - Amy: Well, there was a lot of action.\\
135 - Penny: Mmm.\\
136 - Amy: And the story moved along at a brisk pace. It was, overall, what’s the word I’m looking for?\\
137 - Penny: Stupid?\\
138 - Amy: So stupid.\\
139 - Penny: I don’t know how Leonard can get so caught up in this.\\
140 - Bernadette: It’s crazy, they spend hours arguing about things that don’t even exist.\\
141 - Amy: What a waste of time.\\
142 - Penny: I know. A hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?\\
143 - Bernadette: I don’t think it’s heavy. It’s some sort of magic, so only Thor can lift it.\\
144 - Penny: That makes even less sense, I mean…\\
145 - Amy: No, no, no, it doesn’t. Thor is a god. The hammer is his, only he can use it. It’s like Sheldon and his toothbrush. Or his thin, beckoning lips.\\
146 - Penny: Okay, hang on, what if Thor’s hand is on the hammer? I mean, if he’s touching it with his god magic, does that mean I could lift it?\\
147 - Bernadette: No.\\
148 - Amy: Yes.\\
149 - Penny: Well, which is it?\\
150 - Amy: Maybe we missed something.\\
151 - Bernadette: Let’s read it again.\\
152 - Penny: Okay.\\
153 - Amy: Yeah.\\
154 - Bernadette: You want some tea?\\
155 - Amy: Good idea. I’ll help you.\\
156 - Penny: Wait, I thought we were reading.\\
157 - Amy: We are. We’re just, uh, giving you a head start.\\
158 - Scene: The desert.\\
159 - Howard: I wish my mom was here. We could all hang out in her shadow.\\
160 - Raj: Wool pants in the desert. I feel like I’ve got poached testicles.\\
161 - Leonard: Oh, you poor thing, you’re sweating. That’s so much worse than having your car stolen.\\
162 - Raj: Insurance is gonna buy you a new car. It’s not gonna de-funk my junk.\\
163 - Sheldon: Gentlemen, a little less bellyaching. We’re Starfleet officers and a member of the Borg Collective.\\
164 - Leonard: Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood.\\
165 - Sheldon: Leonard, all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love. And look at us. At this moment, we are, in fact, a Star Trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment, relying only on our wits, our fortitude and our moxie. As long as we have those things, nothing can stop…\\
166 - Guys in Passing Car (throwing a drink over Sheldon): Nerds!\\
167 - Sheldon: I hate this planet.\\
168 - Scene: Penny’s Apartment.\\
169 - Amy: It says right here on the hammer, whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.\\
170 - Bernadette: Hold on, who decides who’s worthy? Does the hammer decide?\\
171 - Penny: Yes!\\
172 - Amy: No! It can’t decide. It’s a hammer.\\
173 - Penny: You said it’s a magic hammer.\\
174 - Amy: Yeah, but, it can’t make decisions.\\
175 - Penny: If Harry Potter’s wand can make decisions, why can’t Thor’s hammer?\\
176 - Amy: Okay, if you’re going to start comparing wands and hammers, I can’t even take you seriously.\\
177 - Scene: A diner.\\
178 - Sheldon: Hello. Hello. Uh, uh, uh, four glasses of water, please. Anything for you guys?\\
179 - Leonard: Can I use your phone? Our car got stolen.\\
180 - Waitress: Why don’t you ask Scotty to beam you up?\\
181 - Sheldon: Scotty was on the original series, and we’re Next Generation. So, joke’s on you.\\
182 - Howard: We’re not with him.\\
183 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
184 - Amy: You can’t pick something up in outer space. In space, there is no up.\\
185 - Penny: Oh, yeah? Then how does the sun come up every day?\\
186 - Amy: Hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.\\
187 - Bernadette: Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall. Why don’t we go look at those?\\
188 - Penny: Oh, great. Yes. And then you will see, I am not wrong, because if we were in outer space, then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment. Yeah, that’s right, the slow reader used science. Suck on that.\\
189 - Scene: The diner.\\
190 - Policeman: Was there anything valuable in the car?\\
191 - Leonard: Our clothes, our wallets, phones.\\
192 - Raj: And about three hundred dollars worth of makeup, so this thief could look like anyone right now.\\
193 - Policeman: Makeup? Sure.\\
194 - Leonard: Uh, we’re going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield. They have a big costume contest. It’s cooler than it sounds.\\
195 - Policeman: I don’t know, sounds pretty cool.\\
196 - Raj: It, it is. It’s not just comic books. They’ve got action figures, toys, a Tron-themed dance party.\\
197 - Leonard: Okay, he gets how cool it is.\\
198 - Policeman: I think I have all I need here. You guys need me to call someone? I’m guessing your moms?\\
199 - Leonard: Thanks, but we’ve got it covered.\\
200 - Howard: Okay, I just talked to my mom. She arranged for us to get a rental car.\\
201 - Raj: Great. We can still make it to Comic-Con.\\
202 - Leonard: Are you kidding me? After all we’ve been through, I just want to go home.\\
203 - Raj: Don’t be like that. Come on, Howard, talk to him.\\
204 - Howard: I’m with Leonard. I’m done.\\
205 - Raj: Fine, then I guess it’s two against two. How do we decide?\\
206 - Sheldon: Actually, it’s three against one.\\
207 - Raj: What? What about the mission? You said we were a real-life landing party.\\
208 - Sheldon: Yeah, well, we’re not. We’re an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we’re idiots. And to tell you the truth, I’m starting to feel like one. I want to go home now.\\
209 - Raj: Okay. Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise? Get it? Enterprise? Screw you. That’s funny.\\
210 - Scene: The apartment.\\
211 - Bernadette: Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor while Thor is holding the hammer?\\
212 - Amy: Yeah?\\
213 - Bernadette: Then by the transitive property of picking things up, Hulk picked up the hammer.\\
214 - Amy: No. Hulk picked up Thor, Thor picked up the hammer.\\
215 - Penny: Okay, hang on. If I go to a bar and pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together, did I pick up the girl?\\
216 - Amy: Did that ever happen?\\
217 - Penny: Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?\\
218 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
219 - Sheldon: Well, I say that’s the last time we ever go outside.\\
220 - Amy (off): Look, right here. Red Hulk is picking up Thor’s hammer ’cause Thor’s touching it.\\
221 - Penny (off): No, it’s because they’re in space. He’s really just touching the strap.\\
222 - Amy(off): The strap is part of the hammer.\\
223 - Bernadette (off): No, it’s not!\\
224 - Raj: Are they actually arguing about comic books?\\
225 - Leonard: No, that can’t be right.\\
226 - Howard: Maybe Thor’s Hammer is a new colour of nail polish.\\
227 - Bernadette (off): Then Red Hulk must be worthy.\\
228 - Penny (off): How could Red Hulk be worthy?\\
229 - Bernadette (off): You don’t know his life.\\
230 - Sheldon: There’s only one logical explanation. Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.\\
231 - Raj: If it’s an alternate dimension, sounds like a job for a landing party.\\
232 - Sheldon: Captain, what are your orders?\\
233 - Leonard: I say we investigate.\\
234 - Sheldon: Wait. They might be hostile.\\
235 - Leonard: Fine, but set them to stun. If we vaporize Penny, I’ll never find a girlfriend that pretty again.\\
236 - Scene: Leonard’s car.\\
237 - GPS: Fun fact, President Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act from his hospital room.\\
238 - First Car Thief: Wow, that is interesting.\\
239 - Second Car Thief: You learn something new every day.\\
240 - GPS: Say, can you name the four state capitols that are not served by the interstate system?\\
241 - First Car Thief: Ooh, another quiz.\\
242 - Second Car Thief: Yes!
\subsection {Episode 14: The Cooper/Kripke Inversion}
1 - Scene: The Apartment.\\
2 - Leonard: Sheldon, your food’s getting cold.\\
3 - Sheldon: I’ll eat later. Right now, I’m suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics.\\
4 - Penny: It’s hot when Sheldon talks dirty.\\
5 - Raj: So, I found this Web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. How awesome is that?\\
6 - Howard: Let me see.\\
7 - Raj: Yeah, you can pick your wardrobe. You can even choose your accessories.\\
8 - Howard: Leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler.\\
9 - Leonard: Oh, this is neat. Think about all the action figures we’ve bought over the years. It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us. Don’t you think?\\
10 - Penny: Yeah, if that’s your idea of what’s cool, you should get one.\\
11 - Leonard: Yeah, so, I’m out.\\
12 - Raj: What do you think, Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?\\
13 - Sheldon: Would it come with Kung-Fu grip?\\
14 - Raj: No.\\
15 - Sheldon: Don’t waste my time.\\
16 - Leonard: You get that these are personalised action figures.\\
17 - Penny: Honey, if you want one, just get one.\\
18 - Howard: You’re still out, right?\\
19 - Leonard: Yep.\\
20 - Credits sequence.\\
21 - Scene: Sheldon’s office.\\
22 - Sheldon: A hush falls over the crowd as Cooper studies the board. He makes his move. He’s dividing both sides by I. He’s adding back the coefficient. He has a value for P. He’s plugging that back in. He takes the derivative, and he solves the equation. The crowd goes wild. Nobel! Nobel!\\
23 - Kripke: Cooper?\\
24 - Sheldon: Nobel. Kripke. Don’t look at my board.\\
25 - Kripke: What’s that?\\
26 - Sheldon: That’s a drawing of a really cool train. Don’t look at that, either. What do you want?\\
27 - Kripke: I have some bad news. You’re working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. I’m working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. The university is only awowed to submit one pwoposal.\\
28 - Sheldon: So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out. That’s hard cheese, Barry. You’re one of the good ones.\\
29 - Kripke: No, they’re making us work together.\\
30 - Sheldon: That’s ridiculous. I am one of the great minds of our generation. I work on a level so rarified you couldn’t even imagine it. I said stop looking at my cool train!\\
31 - Scene: Howard’s lab.\\
32 - Leonard: Hmm. Kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and Bernadette.\\
33 - Howard: Well, I wanted everybody to know I love my wife. And nobody to know I forgot to turn off the laser.\\
34 - Raj: They’re here. Our action figures have arrived. This is the best five hundred dollars I’ve ever spent.\\
35 - Leonard: A thousand dollars on action figures? How can you afford that?\\
36 - Howard: Easy. His family’s loaded, and Bernadette has a great job. My wife came with both fun bags and money bags.\\
37 - Raj: Say hello to an exact scale model of me. Oh, I’m not dark chocolate. I’m melt-in-your-mouth caramel.\\
38 - Howard: Oh, man. Look at my nose.\\
39 - Leonard: Maybe it’s a shipping problem.\\
40 - Howard: What?\\
41 - Leonard: Yeah. Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like you guys.\\
42 - Raj: This sucks.\\
43 - Howard: I can’t believe I wasted all that money.\\
44 - Leonard: Aw, and my girlfriend wouldn’t let me get one. Look at my face. Do I look smug? I feel smug.\\
45 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
46 - Penny: I hate it when you make me sit through all the credits.\\
47 - Leonard: Well, sometimes there’s a secret ending, like in The Avengers.\\
48 - Penny: Yeah, but I don’t think that’s going to happen in a documentary about the Holocaust.\\
49 - Leonard: They could show bloopers. Oh, no.\\
50 - Penny: What is that?\\
51 - Leonard: That is Sheldon’s “I’m unhappy and about to destroy the planet” music. Come on, let’s just go to your place.\\
52 - Penny: Well, wait, if he’s unhappy,shouldn’t we talk to him?\\
53 - Leonard: Shouldn’t we talk to him? Have you learned nothing in six years?\\
54 - Penny (entering apartment): You doing okay, sweetie?\\
55 - Sheldon: There is ominous music playing, and there is an afghan over my head. I don’t know where you’re from, but where I’m from, that means I’m not doing okay.\\
56 - Leonard: Want me to make you some tea?\\
57 - Sheldon: Tea is for when I’m upset. I’m not upset. The university’s forcing me to work with Kripke. I’m outraged.\\
58 - Leonard: So, cocoa?\\
59 - Sheldon: Yes, cocoa. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be paired with someone who’s so incredibly annoying?\\
60 - Leonard: Oh, teacher! Me! Me!\\
61 - Sheldon: See, I did all this great work, and now he’s just going to come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.\\
62 - Penny: What beverage do you make for that?\\
63 - Leonard: Oh, no, no, no, I know this. Uh, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?\\
64 - Sheldon: Yes, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!\\
65 - Scene: Sheldon’s office.\\
66 - Kripke: What the fwig, Cooper? We were supposed to meet in my office a half an hour ago.\\
67 - Sheldon: And yet, now you’re in my office. Point, Cooper. Welcome to the Thunderdome, Kripke.\\
68 - Kripke: We agweed to exchange copies of our work. Let me see yours.\\
69 - Sheldon: Why don’t you show me yours first.\\
70 - Kripke: You think I just few off the turnip twuck? We exchange at the same time.\\
71 - Sheldon: How do I know you’re not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?\\
72 - Kripke: How do I know you’re not going to do that with mine?\\
73 - Sheldon: Because I’m not interested in getting published in Mad magazine. Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome, Barry.\\
74 - Kripke: Are we going to do this or not? Thank you. So, we wead each other’s work, meet again tomowow?\\
75 - Sheldon: Fine.\\
76 - Kripke: Nice twy. This is bwank paper.\\
77 - Sheldon: And I am sure it’s still more valuable than whatever’s in here.\\
78 - Kripke: Cough it up, Cooper.\\
79 - Sheldon: Very well.\\
80 - Kripke: If this one’s bwank, too, I’m going to be fuwious.\\
81 - Sheldon: Fine.\\
82 - Scene: Howard’s lab.\\
83 - Raj: You! Always bet on black.\\
84 - Howard: Get that waste of money out of my face.\\
85 - Raj: It’s only a waste of money if we don’t play with them. (As doll) He’s right, dawg.\\
86 - Howard: Please, I’m working.\\
87 - Raj: You know, there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us.\\
88 - Howard: Oh, yeah? How’s that?\\
89 - Raj: Two words, 3-D printer. Wait, maybe it’s three words. No, hang on. Okay, one word, a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-D printer.\\
90 - Howard: I have always wanted a 3-D printer.\\
91 - Raj: Of course you have. They’re an engineer’s dream. Anything you can design, a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.\\
92 - Howard: Yeah, but they’re so expensive.\\
93 - Raj: Oh, come on. You deserve one. You’ve worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money.\\
94 - Howard: Well, the prices have been coming down.\\
95 - Raj: Oh, true. They’re practically giving them away. You know, in exchange for money.\\
96 - Howard: And we can make stuff we need for work with it. Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs, specialized tools…\\
97 - Raj: Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchin’ dream house.\\
98 - Howard: We don’t need Malibu Koothrappali’s dream house.\\
99 - Raj: Really, smart guy? Where’s he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?\\
100 - Scene: The apartment.\\
101 - Amy:The monkey in my tobacco study has taken to smoking a pipe. I’m supposed to remove his brain to examine, but it’s hard because now he reminds me of my uncle. You’ve been awfully quiet tonight. Is everything okay?\\
102 - Sheldon: I’m fine.\\
103 - Amy: All right, well, how was work today? Did you exchange your research with Kripke?\\
104 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
105 - Amy: Sheldon, what’s going on?\\
106 - Sheldon: I read his research, and, it’s leaps and bounds ahead of mine. Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as I had thought. It’s his mommy.\\
107 - Amy: Sheldon, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better. May I offer you a consoling hug?\\
108 - Sheldon: What do we have to lose?\\
109 - Amy: How’s that?\\
110 - Sheldon: I feel like I’m being strangled by a boa constrictor. Why’d you stop?\\
111 - Scene: The apartment.\\
112 - Leonard: Come on, Sheldon, we’re going to be late.\\
113 - Sheldon: I can’t go in today. I’m sick.\\
114 - Leonard: You’re not sick. You just don’t want to face Kripke.\\
115 - Sheldon: No, look.\\
116 - Leonard: 128.\\
117 - Sheldon: See?\\
118 - Leonard: What did you do, put this in your tea?\\
119 - Sheldon: Oh, dear. Now I’m not even smarter than you.\\
120 - Leonard: Sheldon, Kripke’s not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.\\
121 - Sheldon: Oh, don’t play the Einstein card. His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. So everything was a great breakthrough.\\
122 - Leonard: Sheldon Lee Cooper, I do not have time for this nonsense. Now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work.\\
123 - Sheldon: All right, geez. What a grouch.\\
124 - Leonard: How did I do that? I got to remember how I did that.\\
125 - Scene: Howard’s lab.\\
126 - Howard: Do you realize, by owning a 3-D printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in China?\\
127 - Raj: I think this thing was made in China.\\
128 - Howard: Eh, what can you do?\\
129 - Raj: Ooh, I, I think it’s done. Oh, it worked. We printed a whistle.\\
130 - Howard: Amazing. You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.\\
131 - Raj: And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought.\\
132 - Howard: Okay, give me a superhero pose, and I will scan you into the computer for your action figure.\\
133 - Raj: Oh, I wish I was in better shape.\\
134 - Howard: Stop holding your stomach in. I’ll give you a six-pack with the computer.\\
135 - Raj: Oh, okay, great. Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.\\
136 - Howard: All right, you can suck it in a little bit.\\
137 - Scene: Sheldon’s office.\\
138 - Kripke: Cooper, we have a pwobwem. Your work is weawy not at a wevew I expected it to be.\\
139 - Sheldon: I know. Go ahead, mock me. Just use small words so I understand.\\
140 - Kripke: Don’t pway dumb with me. We both know what your pwobwem is.\\
141 - Sheldon: We do?\\
142 - Kripke: You have a girlfwiend.\\
143 - Sheldon: So?\\
144 - Kripke: So my work would suffew, too, if I was getting waid all the time.\\
145 - Sheldon: Yes. That is the reason. My work is suffering because of all the laid I’m getting.\\
146 - Kripke: You wucky b*st*rd.\\
147 - Sheldon: What can I say, you know? She enjoys my genitals. I am giving them to her on a nightly basis.\\
148 - Kripke: Okay, stop bwagging. You had some bwiwiant insights in here, but if we’re gonna make this work, you need to buckew down and focus.\\
149 - Sheldon: I’ll do what I can. But it’s not going to be easy, because when I’m with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic\\
150 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
151 - Howard: Oh, good, you’re home. Got a little surprise for you.\\
152 - Bernadette: What?\\
153 - Howard: Say hello to my little friend.\\
154 - Bernadette: Oh, my God. That’s so cute. I didn’t think there could be a smaller version of you.\\
155 - Howard: I know, right? And, thanks to photographs and a little 3-D modeling, here comes the bride.\\
156 - Bernadette: Oh, Howie, I love these.\\
157 - Howard: I thought you might.\\
158 - Bernadette: Were they expensive?\\
159 - Howard: Didn’t cost a thing. I made them myself.\\
160 - Bernadette: How?\\
161 - Howard: Koothrappali and I bought a used 3-D printer for $5,000.\\
162 - Bernadette: $5,000 for a couple of dolls? Are you out of your mind?\\
163 - Howard: Not just for a couple of dolls. For as many dolls as we want. And whistles.\\
164 - Bernadette: At any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?\\
165 - Howard: It’s kind of dawning on me now.\\
166 - Bernadette: I don’t believe you. Howie, we can’t afford to waste money on junk like this.\\
167 - Howard: What are you talking about? We make plenty of money.\\
168 - Bernadette: I make plenty of money. You make peanuts.\\
169 - Howard: Yes, but we’re married now. That means, when you get sick, I take care of you. And when you make a bunch of money, I get to buy stuff. Sorry if you don’t like it, but that’s how love works.\\
170 - Bernadette: No, here’s how love works. You’re gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those. Oh, my God! Are you actually thinking about it?\\
171 - Scene: The apartment.\\
172 - Penny: All right, I don’t understand. Why didn’t you just tell Kripke the truth?\\
173 - Sheldon: Because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. Anyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive.\\
174 - Leonard: Is my coitus whimsically inventive?\\
175 - Penny: That is what I write on the bathroom walls. For a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter.\\
176 - Leonard: I know you’re joking, but I’d be okay with that.\\
177 - Penny: Yeah. Sheldon, can I ask you a question?\\
178 - Sheldon: Of course.\\
179 - Penny: You ever going to sleep with Amy?\\
180 - Sheldon: That’s awfully personal.\\
181 - Leonard: We don’t ask Sheldon things like that.\\
182 - Penny: Maybe you don’t, I do. What’s the deal?\\
183 - Sheldon: Well, word around the university is I’m giving her s*x organs a proper jostling.\\
184 - Penny: All right, come on, be serious. Look, you guys have been going out a long time. She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?\\
185 - Leonard: All right, we’re down the rabbit hole. What are you doing?\\
186 - Sheldon: Well, first of all, I’m quite fond of Amy.\\
187 - Penny: Then what’s the problem?\\
188 - Sheldon: Penny, all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others, hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams. But I’m working on it, you know? Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy’s chest. A year ago, that would have been unthinkable.\\
189 - Leonard: Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.\\
190 - Penny: Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?\\
191 - Sheldon: It’s a possibility.\\
192 - Penny (under breath while hitting Leonard): Oh, my God! (Out loud) Sheldon, I know this wasn’t easy for you, and I’m really glad we could have this conversation.\\
193 - Sheldon: Fine.\\
194 - Penny (under breath while hitting Leonard): Oh, my God!\\
195 - Leonard: Ow!\\
196 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
197 - Raj: Are you sure you want to do this? Give up your half of the 3-D printer?\\
198 - Howard: Yes. And can you please make that out to Bernadette? I was taken off the joint account until I learn the value of money.\\
199 - Raj: Wow, that’s harsh.\\
200 - Howard: Tell me about it.\\
201 - Raj: Aren’t you gonna eat lunch?\\
202 - Howard: Nah, I blew my food allowance on Pokemon cards.\\
203 - Scene: Sheldon’s office.\\
204 - Sheldon: Well, the equation balances, but it’s certainly not elegant.\\
205 - Kripke: Whatever. You get any wast night?\\
206 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
207 - Kripke: Gave it to her good, huh?\\
208 - Sheldon: No, I gave it to her well. Now, over here, I was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put…\\
209 - Kripke: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Was she naked, or was she weawing wingewie?\\
210 - Sheldon: I didn’t notice.\\
211 - Kripke: How could you not notice?\\
212 - Sheldon: I was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.\\
213 - Kripke: Ah, you’re kiwing me, Cooper!\\
214 - Sheldon: Can we get back to work?\\
215 - Kripke: Sure, sure, sure. You guys ever use any toys?\\
216 - Sheldon: Toys? I do have a model rocket next to my bed.\\
217 - Kripke: A wocket? You’we a fweak! I wove it!
\subsection {Episode 15: The Spoiler Alert Segmentation}
1 - Scene: The apartment\\
2 - Leonard: I don’t know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for so long. These are great. I just started number six.\\
3 - Sheldon: That’s a good one. Dumbledore dies in that one. Yeah, I know, I didn’t see it coming, either.\\
4 - Leonard: Why would you say that?\\
5 - Sheldon: You brought up the subject. I contributed an interesting fact on that subject. It’s called the art of conversation. Okay, your turn.\\
6 - Leonard: That was a huge spoiler.\\
7 - Sheldon: Good.\\
8 - Leonard: What is wrong with you? If I did that, you’d bitch about it for weeks.\\
9 - Sheldon: Oh, really, Leonard? Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?\\
10 - Leonard: Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?\\
11 - Sheldon: Yes, and I have a theory why. Because of your lactose intolerance, you switched over to soy milk. Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds. I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman.\\
12 - Leonard: You are unbelievable. I don’t know why I put up with you. You’re controlling, you’re irritating.\\
13 - Sheldon: There you go again, nag, nag, nag. You’re only proving my point, little lady.\\
14 - Leonard: You know what? Screw you, Sheldon. You are the most annoying person I have ever met.\\
15 - Sheldon: What? I’m annoying? You criticize my behaviour all the time. Sheldon, don’t talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. Sheldon, when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral, don’t yawn and point at your watch. Sheldon, don’t throw away my shirts ’cause you think they’re ugly. You’re impossible.\\
16 - Leonard: That’s it. I don’t, I don’t have to put up with this.\\
17 - Sheldon: Actually, I have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do.\\
18 - Leonard: Aw. Here’s what I think of your roommate agreement.\\
19 - Sheldon: You pick that up right now.\\
20 - Leonard: No.\\
21 - Sheldon: Roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5, the roommate agreement, like the American flag, cannot touch the ground.\\
22 - Leonard: I don’t care. I don’t have to do anything you say because I don’t think I want to live here anymore.\\
23 - Sheldon: Where are you going?\\
24 - Leonard: To live with Penny and not you, you crazy b*st*rd.\\
25 - Sheldon: Crazy b*st*rd?\\
26 - Leonard: Yes.\\
27 - Sheldon: Leonard, wait.\\
28 - Leonard: What?\\
29 - Sheldon: Dobby the elf dies in book seven.\\
30 - Credits sequence.\\
31 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
32 - Raj: Here you go.\\
33 - Howard: Great. Come on in.\\
34 - Raj: What, you don’t say thank you?\\
35 - Howard: It’s my suitcase. I lent it to you two years ago.\\
36 - Raj: Well, then, I should tell you I broke the wheel and the handle. So, is everyone from Bernadette’s company going to Vegas?\\
37 - Howard: No, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs. It’s part of a bonus she got.\\
38 - Raj: Cool. Did she discover a cure for something?\\
39 - Howard: Not exactly. They spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible a**l leakage.\\
40 - Raj: Is there a good a**l leakage?\\
41 - Howard: Anyway, it was Bernie’s idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation.\\
42 - Raj: Way to make lemonade. You know, from around the corner where fudge is made.\\
43 - Howard: Hey, I got a favour to ask.\\
44 - Raj: Sure.\\
45 - Howard: My mom’s been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her.\\
46 - Raj: Dumped her? What, did he use a forklift? Sorry. There’s nothing funny about morbid obesity.\\
47 - Howard: She’s huge. It was funny. Anyway, I was just hoping that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make sure she’s doing okay.\\
48 - Raj: Dude, I’m a single man. Saturday night is my party night.\\
49 - Howard: Really? What do you got going on?\\
50 - Raj: I don’t know, maybe drive down to Hollywood, hit a few hot spots, see if I can get lucky.\\
51 - Howard: Yeah, tell me if this sounds familiar. You pay fifteen dollars to park, you stand on the pavement for an hour until you break down and give the bouncer twenty bucks to let you in. You push your way to the bar, where you drink an eighteen dollar cosmopolitan, then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together. Your children, grandchildren. Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Then you give up on anyone ever loving you, go to Marie Callender’s, buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot.\\
52 - Raj:What time should I be at your mother’s?\\
53 - Howard: I told her around seven.\\
54 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
55 - Leonard: I swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being I have ever met.\\
56 - Penny: Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.\\
57 - Leonard: Well, I’ve had it. I am done. I can’t, I can’t live with him for one more minute.\\
58 - Penny: Wow. Where are you going to go?\\
59 - Leonard: I was thinking here with you.\\
60 - Penny: Oh.\\
61 - Leonard: That a problem?\\
62 - Penny: No, not at all. No, it’s, it’s great. It’s terrific. I, you know, I just can’t help feel bad about Sheldon. I mean, how’s he going to get by without you? Ernie.\\
63 - Leonard: He’s got Amy now.\\
64 - Penny: Yeah, he does, but it’s not the same.\\
65 - Leonard: Why?\\
66 - Penny: Um, well, um, all right. You, you know how in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ron didn’t abandon Harry just because Harry started dating Ron’s sister?\\
67 - Leonard: Harry and Ginny get together?\\
68 - Penny: Sorry. Spoiler alert. My point is, as much as I want to live with you, I can’t do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you.\\
69 - Leonard: Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat.\\
70 - Penny: Well, you know what they say, if it ain’t broke.\\
71 - Leonard: Wow. It sounds to me like you don’t want us to live together.\\
72 - Penny: No. No, no, I do. I do. It’s just, I mean, it’s a really big step.\\
73 - Leonard: Is it? We’re together all the time. Financially, it makes great sense. Can you think of one reason why we shouldn’t do this?\\
74 - Penny: Well, um, I’m just a little thirsty.\\
75 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
76 - Penny: I got nothing.\\
77 - Leonard: Great. I’ll go get my stuff.\\
78 - Penny: Yeah. Okay, all right, don’t freak out. You can make this work.\\
79 - Leonard: Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine.\\
80 - Penny: Oh, please let some of it be Xanax.\\
81 - Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.\\
82 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Are you ready for dessert?\\
83 - Raj: No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz. As it is, I’m going to have to carry my stomach out of here like I’m a fireman rescuing an infant.\\
84 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, please. You’re a tall glass of brown water. Have dessert.\\
85 - Raj: Well, I, I really couldn’t. But, uh, I’ve had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you’ve had removed from your body over the years. Didn’t know you could have a cyst inside another cyst.\\
86 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): The doctor said they were like Russian nesting dolls. Well, if you have to go, how about I put a little doggie bag together for you?\\
87 - Raj: That would be lovely. Thank you. (Sound of crying) Mrs. Wolowitz, uh, are you okay?\\
88 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Don’t mind me. I just cry when I’m lonely and have nothing to live for.\\
89 - Raj: I, uh, I suppose I could stay for some dessert.\\
90 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Great. You like chocolate chip cheesecake?\\
91 - Raj: Sure.\\
92 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): I’ll make one.\\
93 - Scene: The apartment.\\
94 - Sheldon: One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure. That’s Leonard’s.\\
95 - Amy: Children’s toy.\\
96 - Sheldon: One Star Trek: The Next Generation phaser. That’s Leonard’s.\\
97 - Amy: Children’s toy.\\
98 - Sheldon: One Game of Thrones collector’s edition Longclaw sword. Oh, Leonard and I bought that together. That’s a bit of an ethical conundrum. Eh, I’ll keep it.\\
99 - Amy: So, uh, what’s your plan moving forward?\\
100 - Sheldon: Uh, suppose I’ll have to find and cultivate a new roommate. What a task that will be. Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I took him in?\\
101 - Amy: No.\\
102 - Sheldon: Oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. He would just go whenever the mood struck him.\\
103 - Amy: Like a dog-boy.\\
104 - Sheldon: Exactly.\\
105 - Amy: What if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways?\\
106 - Sheldon: That would be ideal. If a person like that existed, I would sign on, no further questions asked.\\
107 - Amy: Great. Here I am!\\
108 - Sheldon: Wait. Here who is where?\\
109 - Amy: Me. Aren’t I your perfect roommate?\\
110 - Sheldon: Um…\\
111 - Amy: Think about it, Sheldon. I’m not a stranger, we’re intellectually compatible, I’m willing to chauffeur you around town, and your personality quirks, which others find abhorrent or rage-inducing, I find cute as a button. What do you think?\\
112 - Sheldon: Um…\\
113 - Amy: Tell me one reason why this isn’t a fantastic idea.\\
114 - Sheldon: Um…\\
115 - Amy: See? You can’t. I’m gonna go see if Leonard’s room is big enough for my water bed.\\
116 - Sheldon: Um…\\
117 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. \\
118 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Good buddy Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Good buddy Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Good buddy Leonard.\\
119 - Leonard: What do you want?\\
120 - Sheldon: Hey, good buddy. So, uh, I was just talking to Amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing.\\
121 - Leonard: Is that so?\\
122 - Sheldon: Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home. I’ll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then I’ll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy.\\
123 - Leonard: Cut to the chase, Sheldon.\\
124 - Sheldon: Okay. Amy’s decided she wants to move in with me, so I need you to come back home, you lovable scamp. That’s a lot of product.\\
125 - Penny: Hey. What’s going on?\\
126 - Leonard: Oh, get this, suddenly, Sheldon wants me back because Amy wants to move in with him.\\
127 - Penny: Really? Interesting.\\
128 - Leonard: Well, too late, pal. I’m not going anywhere. Penny and I are very happy living together. Isn’t that right?\\
129 - Penny: It’s like the happiness won’t ever leave the apartment.\\
130 - Sheldon: Leonard, please. You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn’t ready for.\\
131 - Penny: Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn’t mean you don’t care about each other, it just means things are moving at a pace you’re not comfortable with, and that’s fine.\\
132 - Leonard: Well, if he doesn’t want to live with her, then he should tell her how he feels.\\
133 - Penny: Well, maybe he doesn’t know how to say it without hurting her feelings.\\
134 - Sheldon: Feelings? What am I, a hippie at a love-in? No. The problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldn’t refute.\\
135 - Penny: That is the worst, isn’t it?\\
136 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
137 - Leonard: I’m sorry, Sheldon. I can’t help you. Oh, spoiler alert, this door’s about to slam in your face.\\
138 - Amy: Oh, there you are. When do I get a key to our apartment?\\
139 - Sheldon: Um…\\
140 - Scene: Howard’s old bedroom. A phone is ringing.\\
141 - Raj: Hello?\\
142 - Howard: Hey. How’d it go last night with my mom?\\
143 - Raj: Okay, I guess.\\
144 - Howard: What time did you leave?\\
145 - Raj: Actually, I’m still here.\\
146 - Howard: What? You spent the night?\\
147 - Raj: Yeah. Uh, after dinner, we watched a rerun of Rockford Files, and then she opened a bottle of, uh, cream sherry, and the next thing I know, she was tucking me into your bed.\\
148 - Howard: You wore my pyjamas?\\
149 - Raj: Mm-hmm. How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed, like, three times.\\
150 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Rajesh! You up? You ready for breakfast?\\
151 - Raj: Oh, boy. Breakfast.\\
152 - Howard: Okay, Raj, listen to me. You need to get out of there.\\
153 - Raj: But I have a cream sherry hangover and I smell blintzes.\\
154 - Howard: If you don’t leave now, she’ll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life.\\
155 - Raj: Oh, Howard, stop.\\
156 - Howard: Trust me, you’re not Jewish. That’s how they get you.\\
157 - Raj: You’re being silly. I can leave whenever I want.\\
158 - Howard: Oh, really? Where are your clothes and your shoes?\\
159 - Raj: They’re on the chair, right over… Oy vey.\\
160 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
161 - Sheldon: Hello, home wrecker.\\
162 - Penny: What did I do?\\
163 - Sheldon: You gave Leonard somewhere to go. Thanks to you, Amy’s out buying his and hers bath towels. Like I’d ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it.\\
164 - Penny: Okay. Listen, the truth is I don’t want him living with me.\\
165 - Sheldon: Great. Kick him out. Break his heart. Everybody wins.\\
166 - Penny: No, I don’t want to break his heart. I love him. This is just happening too fast.\\
167 - Sheldon: You think this is fast? It’s just a matter of time before I see Amy’s leg stubble in my shower.\\
168 - Penny: Yeah, and I’ve seen those legs. You might want to get some Drano.\\
169 - Sheldon: Hold on. If you don’t want to live with Leonard, why don’t you just tell him?\\
170 - Penny: Well, you know how he is. He’s sensitive and emotional.\\
171 - Sheldon: That’s because he drinks too much soy milk.\\
172 - Penny: Well, I don’t know what else we can do but tell them the truth.\\
173 - Sheldon: I suppose there’s no choice but to face the crying, angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair.\\
174 - Penny: Yeah. And who knows how Amy will react.\\
175 - Scene: A hotel room.\\
176 - Howard: Here’s some more ice.\\
177 - Bernadette: Oh, thanks.\\
178 - Howard: What were we thinking? We should have just done it the regular way.\\
179 - Bernadette: Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque du Soleil made it look so easy.\\
180 - Howard: Honestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need with you?\\
181 - Bernadette: If you could bend that far, you’d be doing us both a favour. (Phone) \\
182 - Howard: Hey, Raj. What’s up?\\
183 - Raj: You were right. I can’t get out of here.\\
184 - Howard: You’re still at my mother’s?\\
185 - Raj: I’m trapped. My clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys. I think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks. What do I do?\\
186 - Howard: Hey, you wanted a woman in your life. Now you got one.\\
187 - Raj: Come on, Howard, help me.\\
188 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Rajesh, tatellah, I ran you a bath.\\
189 - Raj: Oh, my God. She’s not gonna bathe me, is she?\\
190 - Howard: Gee, I wish I could tell you no. All right, well, thanks again for helping me out.\\
191 - Raj: But, Howard…\\
192 - Bernadette: Should we go back and rescue him?\\
193 - Howard: It’s too late. We’ll see him at his Bar Mitzvah.\\
194 - Scene: The apartment.\\
195 - Amy: Here you go. I picked up the Chinese food just the way Leonard used to.\\
196 - Sheldon: Is it kung pao chicken?\\
197 - Amy: Yes.\\
198 - Sheldon: Brown rice, not white rice?\\
199 - Amy: Yes.\\
200 - Sheldon: Spicy mustard from the Korean deli?\\
201 - Amy: Yes. I did good, right?\\
202 - Sheldon: Yes. Amy, are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?\\
203 - Amy: No.\\
204 - Sheldon: Yeah, why would you?\\
205 - Amy: Oh, and, uh, check this out. I took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us.\\
206 - Sheldon: Hello. This is Sheldon.\\
207 - Amy: And this is Amy.\\
208 - Sheldon: We’re not home right now.\\
209 - Amy: ‘Cause we out dropping science, son.\\
210 - Together: Leave a message.\\
211 - Amy: Beep.\\
212 - Sheldon: You can’t live here.\\
213 - Amy: What? Why? Is it the message? I only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn’t break in.\\
214 - Sheldon: No. It’s not the message.\\
215 - Amy: Well, what is it, then? I did everything just the way you like it.\\
216 - Sheldon: You did.\\
217 - Amy: Then what the hell, Sheldon? We have been going out for over two years, and I have been nothing but patient with you. I watch your dopey space movies. I signed your ridiculous contract. I even stopped wearing lip gloss ’cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery. I am the best girlfriend you’re ever gonna have. You give me one good reason why I can’t live here.\\
218 - Sheldon: It’s Penny’s fault.\\
219 - Amy: What?\\
220 - Sheldon: She doesn’t want to live with Leonard, so he has to come live here again. She’s the snake in our garden. She’s the reason we can’t be happy.\\
221 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
222 - Penny: Hey, Ames.\\
223 - Amy: Yeah. Hey, Ames, nothing. I was all set to move in with Sheldon, and now I hear I can’t ’cause you don’t want to live with Leonard.\\
224 - Leonard (off): What?\\
225 - Penny: Sheldon, what did you say?\\
226 - Sheldon: I said the truth. You don’t want to live with Leonard, and you know it.\\
227 - Leonard: Since when don’t you want to live with me?\\
228 - Penny: Oh, don’t get all huffy. You’re the one who decided to move in without even asking me if I was ready.\\
229 - Sheldon: Yeah, I think we should talk about that.\\
230 - Penny: And since you love the truth so much, why don’t you tell Amy you don’t want to live with her instead of blaming it on me?\\
231 - Sheldon: I thought we were talking about the other thing.\\
232 - Amy: You’re a coward.\\
233 - Sheldon: Well, the evidence does support that.\\
234 - Penny: Come on, Amy, let’s go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are.\\
235 - Amy: You know what would show them? I should move in here with you.\\
236 - Penny: Um…\\
237 - Sheldon: Do you want to catch up on some Walking Dead?\\
238 - Leonard: ‘Kay.\\
239 - Sheldon: Have you seen the one where Lori dies?\\
240 - Leonard: No.\\
241 - Sheldon: Or maybe she doesn’t. Let’s find out.\\
242 - Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house. Raj is climbing out of the window.\\
243 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Where you going?\\
244 - Raj (screams): No!
\subsection {Episode 16: The Tangible Affection Proof}
1 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
2 - Penny: You’ll never believe what happened to me at work today.\\
3 - Leonard: Hmm?\\
4 - Penny: This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life.\\
5 - Leonard: You’re kidding. Did you Heimlich him?\\
6 - Penny: No. I said, oh, my God, I think that old guy’s choking, and then one of the busboys Heimlich’ed him.\\
7 - Leonard: You’re a hero.\\
8 - Penny: Yeah, that was the point of the story.\\
9 - Leonard: Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have Thursday night off?\\
10 - Penny: Um, I think so. Why?\\
11 - Leonard: What do you mean, why? It’s Valentine’s Day.\\
12 - Penny: Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something.\\
13 - Leonard: You could be a little more into it.\\
14 - Penny: No, I’m into it, I’m into it. Just, there’s so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out.\\
15 - Leonard: Okay, well, this time it’s going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You don’t see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!\\
16 - Penny: You know, sometimes I think I’ve made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that.\\
17 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
18 - Sheldon: So, in conclusion, I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste.\\
19 - Amy: I concur, but you changed the subject. What are we doing for Valentine’s Day?\\
20 - Sheldon: Oh, you caught that, did you?\\
21 - Credits sequence.\\
22 - Scene: The comic book store.\\
23 - Howard (on phone): Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay! Okay.\\
24 - Raj: Everything okay?\\
25 - Howard: Bernie’s a little cranky since she’s been working, like, 17 hours a day. And I’ve got a lot on my plate, too, because I’ve been busting my tail playing Assassin’s Creed.\\
26 - Raj: Hey, Stuart, you got anything going on for Valentine’s Day?\\
27 - Stuart: Not really. Other than hiding all the sharp objects around here and white-knuckling it till morning. What do you got going on?\\
28 - Raj: Oh, well, I was going to spend the night with my special little lady, but, uh, she got worms, and then I had to take her to the vet.\\
29 - Stuart: There must be something we can do.\\
30 - Raj: Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who don’t have dates?\\
31 - Stuart That actually sounds kind of nice.\\
32 - Raj: Yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself.\\
33 - Stuart: That’s good. Or maybe something a little less hand in the pants.\\
34 - Scene: Sheldon’s office.\\
35 - Sheldon: Ah, Alex, excellent. I have a research problem that I believe you can help with.\\
36 - Alex: Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank you. I’ve been waiting for an opportunity to contribute to your scientific work.\\
37 - Sheldon: Oh, no, no. That’s not going to happen, no. What I need you to do is find a Valentine’s gift for my girlfriend.\\
38 - Alex: You realize I passed up an opportunity to work at Fermilab to take this job with you.\\
39 - Sheldon: Well, I guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents. Now, here is, let’s see, this is, this is about two thousand dollars, um, I think she likes monkeys and the colour grey. Contribute to my work. Ah, kids say the darnedest things.\\
40 - Scene: Howard’s lab.\\
41 - Leonard: Hey, you coming to lunch?\\
42 - Howard: Yeah, one second. Come here. I want to show you something.\\
43 - Leonard: What you looking at?\\
44 - Howard: Well, I was trying to come up with something really romantic to give Bernadette for Valentine’s Day since she’s been such a pain in the ass.\\
45 - Leonard: You can’t find a card that says that?\\
46 - Howard: Check it out. I used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.\\
47 - Leonard: Oh, that’s cool.\\
48 - Howard: A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.\\
49 - Leonard: From her micro-husband. That is amazing. How long did this take you?\\
50 - Howard: Mmm, about twelve hours. I pulled an all-nighter.\\
51 - Leonard: Oh, wow.\\
52 - Howard: Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. What are you and Penny doing?\\
53 - Leonard: Oh, I’m going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner.\\
54 - Howard: Oh, that’s not bad, but as far as romance goes, I think my gift hits it right out of… (Bumps into chair and drops the slide)\\
55 - Leonard: Want to come to dinner with us?\\
56 - Howard: Yes, please.\\
57 - Scene: The apartment.\\
58 - Sheldon: Okay. Amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect Valentine’s gift, so, you’re up kid. Dazzle me. Go.\\
59 - Alex: Okay, I think I have some really great choices. I went on Amy’s Facebook page and read up on her interests.\\
60 - Sheldon: Now, see, I never would have thought to do that. Clearly, I made a good choice farming this out to you. But I am telling you, Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. Anyway, my socks are on. Let’s knock them off.\\
61 - Alex: Well, um, I know she loves playing the harp, so I found this beautiful music box that plays one of her favourite songs.\\
62 - Sheldon: Now, Amy already has a real harp. And it can play any song. What are you trying to pull here?\\
63 - Alex: No, I just thought it would be…\\
64 - Sheldon: Next.\\
65 - Alex: Okay. Um, I know she’s a fan of The Canterbury Tales.\\
66 - Sheldon: Mmm.\\
67 - Alex: So I found this cool map that illustrates the character’s journey through England. I thought we could put it in a really nice frame.\\
68 - Sheldon: But she’s got Google Maps on her phone.\\
69 - Alex: I don’t know how to respond to that.\\
70 - Sheldon: Well, I hope it’s with a third good option, because these first two, buh.\\
71 - Alex: Okay. Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last. Since Amy’s a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, did lots of hand drawings of brain cells. And I managed to find this signed print.\\
72 - Sheldon: Wow. Oh, this is truly remarkable.\\
73 - Alex: Thank you.\\
74 - Sheldon: I think I’ll keep it for myself.\\
75 - Alex: What about your girlfriend?\\
76 - Sheldon: It’s too late. I call dibs.\\
77 - Scene: a restaurant.\\
78 - Penny: This place is really beautiful.\\
79 - Leonard: Waugh, romance ninja.\\
80 - Penny: Hey.\\
81 - Howard: Sorry we’re late.\\
82 - Penny: No problem. We just sat down.\\
83 - Leonard: Mmm, would you like some wine?\\
84 - Bernadette: Yeah, fill her up. I’ll tell you when to stop.\\
85 - Penny: Is everything okay?\\
86 - Howard: Terrific. Couldn’t be better.\\
87 - Bernadette: Oh, bite me.\\
88 - Howard: Look, we can still have a nice night. Just tell me where it is.\\
89 - Bernadette: Maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, I’d tell you.\\
90 - Leonard: Uh, where what is?\\
91 - Howard: She hid my Xbox like I’m a child. Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don’t give it back, I’m telling.\\
92 - Bernadette: I’ve been working late every night. All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did he do it? No. He just kept on playing that stupid game. You like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine.\\
93 - Howard: I said I’m sorry.\\
94 - Bernadette: Sorry doesn’t clean my underpants, buddy.\\
95 - Howard: I told you, turn them inside out.\\
96 - Bernadette: And I told you to bite me.\\
97 - Leonard: Trying to have a magical night here, guys.\\
98 - Penny: Oh, son of a bitch.\\
99 - Leonard: What?\\
100 - Penny: Nothing. Nothing.\\
101 - Leonard: No, tell me.\\
102 - Penny: It’s just this guy I used to date.\\
103 - Leonard: Oh.\\
104 - Penny: Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen, who’s here with him now.\\
105 - Leonard: You’re kidding.\\
106 - Penny: And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it.\\
107 - Leonard: I know it’s not ideal, but don’t let them ruin our night.\\
108 - Penny: No, you’re totally right. She could be skinny ’cause she’s dying.\\
109 - Leonard: That’s the spirit.\\
110 - Penny: You know what, screw them. Our night is going to be way more special than theirs.\\
111 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
112 - Bernadette: Uh-oh.\\
113 - Penny: What? (Penny’s ex is proposing to Gretchen) Oh, you got to be kidding me.\\
114 - Gretchen: Oh, my God, yes. Of course I’ll marry you.\\
115 - Leonard: Two can play this game. Penny…\\
116 - Penny: Get up.\\
117 - Leonard: All right.\\
118 - Scene: The comic book store.\\
119 - Raj: It’s nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine’s Day can come here tonight and be together.\\
120 - Stuart: Yeah, I’m really looking forward to it. In fact, there’s no place I would rather be than here.\\
121 - Raj: Except on a date with anybody.\\
122 - Stuart: Literally anybody.\\
123 - Raj: You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out. If you were a girl, all our problems would be solved.\\
124 - Stuart: What?\\
125 - Raj: Oh, yeah, think about it. We’d hang out, we’d read comic books, we’d see movies. It’d be like the best relationship ever.\\
126 - Stuart: That does sound nice.\\
127 - Raj: Then I’d take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion.\\
128 - Stuart: What?\\
129 - Scene: The restaurant.\\
130 - Penny: Oh, I can’t believe he’s going to marry the girl he cheated on me with.\\
131 - Leonard: Isn’t it kind of nice? I mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person.\\
132 - Penny: What, so I’m the wrong person? Maybe you want to be with Gretchen, too.\\
133 - Bernadette: They do look happy.\\
134 - Howard: Yeah, maybe tonight. But a year from now, he’ll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox. Well, he will.\\
135 - Leonard: You know what? Why don’t we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine’s Day?\\
136 - Penny: Yes, absolutely. Now they’re doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that.\\
137 - Leonard: I thought we were letting it go.\\
138 - Penny: We were; it’s just, it’s not fair, okay? They’re bad people. It’s not supposed to end happy for them, it’s supposed to end happy for me.\\
139 - Leonard: Um, it did end happy for you. You’re here with me.\\
140 - Penny: Yeah, yeah, I know.\\
141 - Leonard: Okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally.\\
142 - Penny: Oh, come on, don’t make this about you.\\
143 - Leonard: Oh, I’m not. It’s about you.\\
144 - Penny: Yeah, well, whatever, okay? I told you, Valentine’s Day sucks.\\
145 - Leonard: This one does, and you’re the reason why.\\
146 - Penny: What?\\
147 - Bernadette: You know, compared to them, I’m feeling pretty good about us.\\
148 - Howard: Me, too. How about we blow off dessert, go home early, I’ll do that laundry.\\
149 - Bernadette: Thank you.\\
150 - Howard: I love you.\\
151 - Bernadette: Love you, too.\\
152 - Howard: So where’d you hide it?\\
153 - Bernadette: Where you’d never look.\\
154 - Howard: Damn it, it’s in the washing machine.\\
155 - Scene: The apartment.\\
156 - Amy: Hello.\\
157 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
158 - Amy: Happy Valentine’s Day.\\
159 - Sheldon: Okay. Shall we go to dinner?\\
160 - Amy: Hang on. As you know, I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts.\\
161 - Sheldon: Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy it. I’ve been working on this facial expression all day.\\
162 - Amy: And I appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, I decided I was being selfish. So, I cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentine’s Day.\\
163 - Sheldon: What is that?\\
164 - Amy: By doing none of it. No dinner, no romance, no gifts. We stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved Star War Trek things.\\
165 - Sheldon: Really?\\
166 - Amy: Well, that’s what you’d love, isn’t it?\\
167 - Sheldon: More than anything.\\
168 - Amy: Well, then, that’s what we’re going to do.\\
169 - Sheldon: Well, I don’t know what to say. This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone’s ever given me. And that’s including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.\\
170 - Amy: I’m your girlfriend. That’s my job. And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return.\\
171 - Sheldon: No. No, after everything you didn’t do for me tonight, I want you to have it.\\
172 - Amy: What’s this?\\
173 - Sheldon: Read it.\\
174 - Amy: Sheldon Cooper, Caltech University employee information?\\
175 - Sheldon: At the bottom.\\
176 - Amy: In case of emergency, please contact… Amy Farrah Fowler. And there’s my phone number. This is the most beautiful gift you could’ve ever given me.\\
177 - Sheldon: Well, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would I want to share that with?\\
178 - Amy: And you picked me.\\
179 - Sheldon: It’s like you said, you’re my girlfriend.\\
180 - Amy: Oh, Sheldon.\\
181 - Sheldon: Yeah. Okay. Stop ruining Valentine’s Day and order my pizza.\\
182 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
183 - Penny: Night.\\
184 - Leonard: Yep. You know what? That was pretty crappy of you. I mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night, and it’s like you-you went out of your way to destroy it.\\
185 - Penny: Yeah, I know. I’m a total bitch.\\
186 - Leonard: I’m not saying that.\\
187 - Penny: Well, I am.\\
188 - Leonard: Fine, you win. You’re a bitch. Why couldn’t we just have a nice time?\\
189 - Penny: I don’t know. Maybe ’cause things are going so well between us lately and I’ve been really happy.\\
190 - Leonard: Okay, you’re gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.\\
191 - Penny: Obviously, I have some commitment issues.\\
192 - Leonard: Glaringly obvious. Go on.\\
193 - Penny: As long as things keep going great between us, you’ll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually I’m gonna end up saying yes, and then we’re gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out.\\
194 - Leonard: Okay. I know I propose a lot. So how about this? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.\\
195 - Penny: What, what do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?\\
196 - Leonard: No. No, no, no, no. But if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me.\\
197 - Penny: Really?\\
198 - Leonard: Yes. It’s all on you. But I got to tell you, when the time comes, I want the whole nine yards. I want you down on one knee, flowers, I want to be swept off my feet.\\
199 - Penny: Yeah, you got it.\\
200 - Leonard: And I’m cool with surprises. But nothing on a Jumbotron. I don’t want to cry on a big screen like that.\\
201 - Penny: Okay. You know what? This might be the wine talking, but I have a very important question to ask you.\\
202 - Leonard: You do?\\
203 - Penny: Leonard Hofstadter?\\
204 - Leonard: Yes?\\
205 - Penny: Will you be my valentine?\\
206 - Leonard: Sorry. Maybe next year. I’m just kidding. Romance ninja. Let’s have s*x. Waugh!\\
207 - Scene: The comic book store.\\
208 - Nerdy guy: Thank you, guys, for doing this.\\
209 - Raj: We’re glad you could make it.\\
210 - Nerdy guy: Usually I spend Valentine’s Day sad and alone. This year, I’m just sad.\\
211 - Raj: What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?\\
212 - Stuart: I know. I hate myself most of the time, but tonight’s the night I know everyone else does, too.\\
213 - Nerdy guy: I think you’re cool.\\
214 - Stuart: Great.\\
215 - Raj: I got to tell you, we’ve got to stop beating ourselves up like this. Excuse me, everybody. Can I have your attention, please? We’re all here tonight because we have no one to be with. But that doesn’t make us mutants. The only mutants here are in these comic books. We’ve got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we’re in a relationship. You know what I see when I look around? I see a room full of great people. So let’s give ourselves a break. We are a community, and as long as we have each other, we’re never truly alone.\\
216 - Girl: That was cool. What you said.\\
217 - Raj: You really think so?\\
218 - Girl: Yeah, I do.\\
219 - Raj: Thank you. Uh, would you like to, uh, get a cup, a cup of coffee or…?\\
220 - Girl: Okay.\\
221 - Raj: Later, losers!\\
222 - Scene: Amy’s lab. Phone rings.\\
223 - Amy: Hello? Another medical emergency? What’s wrong with him now? I seriously doubt he was bitten by a Chinese bird spider. How exactly does a bump feel Asian? Just put him on the phone. Sheldon, I am not driving over there again. Because I drove over there yesterday for a brain tumour that turned out to be an ice cream headache. Yes, I still want to be your emergency contact. Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumour. I’m on my way. Brain tumour would explain a lot.
\subsection {Episode 17: The Monster Isolation}
1 - Scene: (After a “previously on” sequence) A coffee shop\\
2 - Raj: So then I went to Cambridge, which was wonderful not only because it’s a good school but because it totally looks like Hogwarts. That’s where I fell in love with astronomy, and now I’m an astrophysicist at Caltech, so I guess you could say, uh, Raj is my name and stars are my game. And rhyming is also my game. So, uh, two games. Uh, anyway, that, that’s enough about me. I want to hear everything about you.\\
3 - Girl: I have to go to the bathroom.\\
4 - Raj: I go to the bathroom, too. Sometimes more frequently than I care to admit. Oh, I’ve had it checked out, it’s nothing. Hmm. This is going great. Mmm, can I have a refill on my chai tea? Yes, I have a good feeling about this. (Girl can be seen sneaking past window and leaving) I should have bought condoms.\\
5 - Credits sequence.\\
6 - Scene: The apartment.\\
7 - Sheldon: Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. My apologies that this episode is coming late. I did shoot one last week, in honour of Black History Month, but I was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of George Washington Carver could be considered wildly racist. My heart goes out to the members of the African-American community, who, like me, have been kept down by The Man. Now, Fun with Flags is not just for the flag aficionado, it’s also for the flag novice, so, to help me with that, please welcome my friend, neighbour, and flag virgin, yeah, not a real virgin. She’s had coitus many times. Sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast. Once while he was trying to watch The Incredibles. Penny.\\
8 - Penny: Hello.\\
9 - Sheldon: So, Penny, I understand you would like to learn more about flags.\\
10 - Penny: Yeah, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been at a party where everyone’s talking about flags and I just couldn’t join in.\\
11 - Sheldon: Yeah. Well, you came to the right place.\\
12 - Penny: Uh, I’m sorry, can we just pause for a minute?\\
13 - Sheldon: What’s wrong?\\
14 - Penny: I just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera, you know, like, like a real conversation. It’s something we work on in my acting class.\\
15 - Sheldon: Interesting. A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic. Perhaps that isn’t the compliment it sounds like.\\
16 - Penny: Yeah, let’s try it again, and maybe, this time, you could work on your body language a bit. You know, when you’re all hunched like that, you’re shutting the audience out, but when you’re relaxed and open, you’re inviting them in.\\
17 - Sheldon: Right. And which one do I want?\\
18 - Penny: Let’s try open.\\
19 - Sheldon: If our friend, the flag, has taught me anything, it’s to go where the wind takes you. As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole. And, action. So, Penny, what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night?\\
20 - Penny: Um, well, I’m from Nebraska. So what can you tell me about the state flag?\\
21 - Sheldon: Gosh, Penny, what’d you have for breakfast? A big glass of good question juice? The Nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue. Spread your legs, invite them in.\\
22 - Scene: Outside Raj’s apartment.\\
23 - Howard: I’m telling you, something’s wrong. I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble.\\
24 - Bernadette: Geez, how close were you guys before we got married?\\
25 - Leonard: Don’t look under that rock. (Knocking) Raj, you okay?\\
26 - Howard: You in there?\\
27 - Raj (off): Go away!\\
28 - Leonard: Come on, buddy, open up.\\
29 - Howard: We’re worried about you.\\
30 - Raj (off): Oh, just because I’ve stopped going to work and answering my phone you think something bad happened? Maybe something good happened.\\
31 - Bernadette: Did something good happen?\\
32 - Raj (off): Of course not. Nothing good ever happens. (Opens door. He is wearing a stained vest, his hair is unkempt, and he is drinking wine from a bottle.)\\
33 - Leonard: Whoa.\\
34 - Raj: What?\\
35 - Leonard: Nope, just, just, whoa.\\
36 - Bernadette: It smells pretty ripe in here. You kind feel it in your eyes.\\
37 - Leonard: Raj, what’s going on?\\
38 - Raj: I was humiliated by yet another woman.\\
39 - Howard: You didn’t kill her and chop her up, that’s not what we’re smelling, right?\\
40 - Raj: No. I took her for coffee, and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me.\\
41 - Bernadette: Oh, you poor baby.\\
42 - Raj: I went and looked. It was a high and tiny window. She must have been very motivated.\\
43 - Howard: I’m sorry. That’s awful, but come on, you got to shake it off.\\
44 - Leonard: Yeah, you can’t stay in your apartment for the rest of your life.\\
45 - Raj: Why not? With online shopping and overnight delivery, I can get anything I want. Look, I just ordered a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and two live lobsters on Amazon.\\
46 - Leonard: Lobsters overnight?\\
47 - Howard: Oh, you’re kidding. Let me see. Well, I’ll be. Look, you can throw in a couple steaks and have a surf and turf.\\
48 - Leonard: The surf and turf sounds good. See if they have corn on the cob.\\
49 - Bernadette: Guys, we’re trying to get him out of here, not you in.\\
50 - Raj: You’re wasting your time. Just please, leave me alone.\\
51 - Howard: Now what?\\
52 - Leonard: I don’t know.\\
53 - Bernadette: We could go to Red Lobster and talk about it. We’re all thinking it. I just had the decency to wait for him to leave.\\
54 - Scene: The apartment.\\
55 - Amy (on webcam): Hello, Sheldon.\\
56 - Sheldon: Hello. How’s the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?\\
57 - Amy: Fine. Just hold on. Mommy’s on the phone! Sorry. We’ve cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day, so things are a little intense. Makes me miss my marijuana-abusing flatworms. Those guys were mellow.\\
58 - Sheldon: Good news. Uh, the latest episode of Fun with Flags is online.\\
59 - Amy: Oh, that’s right. How’d it go with Penny?\\
60 - Sheldon: Much better than I expected. She even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language. Watch. Welcome to my world. Not welcome to my world. Welcome. Not welcome.\\
61 - Amy: Subtle, but powerful.\\
62 - Sheldon: I know. I’m still learning to control it.\\
63 - Amy: Did you tell Penny how helpful she was?\\
64 - Sheldon: Why would I do that?\\
65 - Amy: Because she’s your friend, and she did a nice job. I’m sure she’d like to hear it.\\
66 - Sheldon: All right.\\
67 - Amy: I didn’t mean now. Hello? Yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette. Well, I’d like a normal boyfriend. Deal with it.\\
68 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
69 - Penny: Oh, hi. What’s up?\\
70 - Sheldon: Um…\\
71 - Penny: You need me to shut the door so you can do your knocking thing?\\
72 - Sheldon: No. I didn’t start yet, it’s fine.\\
73 - Penny: Okay. So, what do you need?\\
74 - Sheldon: Well, I was thinking about you helping me out last night (knock, knock, knock)Penny. And I just wanted to tell you (knock, knock, knock) Penny, that the answer to the question, who did a great job? is you, (knock, knock, knock) Penny.\\
75 - Penny: Really?\\
76 - Sheldon: Yes, you were very natural in front of the camera, and I found your suggestions extremely helpful.\\
77 - Penny: Aw, sweetie, you just made my day.\\
78 - Sheldon: Okay.\\
79 - Penny: Hey, my acting class is putting on a play Friday night. I could put you and Amy on the guest list.\\
80 - Sheldon: Oh, that sounds terrible. Why would I want to do that?\\
81 - Scene: The apartment.\\
82 - Amy (on webcam): That’s right. They’re no good without the lighter.\\
83 - Sheldon: Well, so much for your advice on complimenting Penny.\\
84 - Amy: Why? What happened?\\
85 - Sheldon: She tried to rope us into going to her acting class to see a play. Don’t worry. Luckily, I had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river.\\
86 - Amy: Sheldon, that’s very rude. She helped you with your show. The right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play.\\
87 - Sheldon: Oh, so many crazy rules.\\
88 - Amy: That better be Tootsie Rolls you’re throwing at me!\\
89 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
90 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. Oh yeah, much better.\\
91 - Penny: What?\\
92 - Sheldon: Amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me, I’m obligated to do something nice for you. So, yes, I’ll go to your dopey play.\\
93 - Penny: Hey, I don’t want you to go any more.\\
94 - Sheldon: Why not?\\
95 - Penny: You should go ’cause you want to go, not because you have to.\\
96 - Sheldon: Oh, Dear Lord, more rules? Where does it stop? Can I want to go because I have to want to go?\\
97 - Penny: Okay. Do whatever you want.\\
98 - Sheldon: Yeah, but now, wait. Do whatever I want? Or whatever I have to want?\\
99 - Penny: Oh, for God’s sake, just come to the play.\\
100 - Sheldon: All right. I don’t want to, but at least that makes sense.\\
101 - Scene: The comic book store.\\
102 - Sheldon: You know, I haven’t seen Raj in several days. Is he no longer a part of our social group? And if so, should we be interviewing for a replacement? Perhaps, this time, we go Latin.\\
103 - Howard: He’s just decided he’s never leaving his apartment again.\\
104 - Sheldon: Oh, brilliant. I’ve been itching to pull that trigger.\\
105 - Howard: He’s upset because he can’t get anywhere with women.\\
106 - Sheldon: Would it help if I gave him some pointers? I’m just funnin’ ya.\\
107 - Girl: Hi. I don’t know if you remember me, but I was here the other night at your party.\\
108 - Stuart: Oh, yeah, you left with Raj.\\
109 - Girl: Uh, yeah.\\
110 - Howard: You’re the one? Okay, let me tell you something. That guy you blew off happens to be my best friend. Okay? He was devastated.\\
111 - Girl: Sorry. Can you just give him this?\\
112 - Howard: Okay. But I gotta warn you, Raj is a proud, passionate man. If you go running out on him again, you’re only gonna get, like, three or four more chances before you are history.\\
113 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
114 - Howard: Come on, she came back. This is good news. You should celebrate.\\
115 - Raj: I don’t want to celebrate.\\
116 - Howard: Not even a little? I mean, we could have a pants party. Go put some on.\\
117 - Raj: Why would I want her number? I don’t want anything to do with this woman.\\
118 - Howard: Oh, come on, Raj.\\
119 - Raj: No, you don’t get it. I want nothing to do with any woman. My heart is stone. From now on, I’m a monk. I renounce all worldly pleasures. Except for lobster. And garlic butter.\\
120 - Howard: Boy, I want to tell you it’s her loss, but you are not making it easy.\\
121 - Raj: You’re, you’re a good friend for trying to help, but, I’ve made my choice.\\
122 - Howard: All right. Well, I’ll see you around.\\
123 - Raj: See you. No, wait, take her number. I don’t want the temptation.\\
124 - Howard: Okay.\\
125 - Raj: I must be strong so I don’t stray from my true purpose, the study of the universe.\\
126 - Howard: All right. Thanks for ruining lobster for me.\\
127 - Scene: Outside on the street.\\
128 - Raj: Wait! Give me the number! Give me the number! Give me the number!\\
129 - Scene: The apartment.\\
130 - Leonard: So, Amy, what’s going on with your addiction study?\\
131 - Amy: Sadly, I’m no longer associated with that project.\\
132 - Leonard: Why? What happened?\\
133 - Amy: Typical bureaucratic nonsense. You can get animals addicted to a harmful substance, you can dissect their brains, but you throw their own faeces back at them and suddenly you’re unprofessional.\\
134 - Leonard: I’m sorry. That I asked.\\
135 - Sheldon: All right, let’s get this stupid play over with.\\
136 - Leonard: Uh, hang on. Empty your pockets.\\
137 - Sheldon: Why?\\
138 - Leonard: You know why. The Nintendo DS. And the PSP. Now the Gameboy.\\
139 - Sheldon: Aw, for Pete’s sake. Can we go now?\\
140 - Leonard: Well, is that all of it? (Pulls a Rubik’s cube from his pants.) Just set it down.\\
141 - Amy: Just so you know, this is not a stupid play. A Streetcar Named Desire is an American classic.\\
142 - Sheldon: It’s about streetcars? Oh, great. I won’t need this. (Pulls out an etch-a-sketch.)\\
143 - Scene: Outside Raj’s apartment. The girl from the comic book store knocks on the door.\\
144 - Raj: Just a sec. Oh, who says just a sec? I hate myself. Hello.\\
145 - Girl: Hi.\\
146 - Raj: Uh, would you like to come in?\\
147 - Girl: Oh, no, I can’t stay.\\
148 - Raj: Oh.\\
149 - Girl: I just wanted to say, I’m sorry for running out of the coffee shop. That wasn’t cool. So, uh, yeah. I’m sorry.\\
150 - Raj: Wait. Can you at least tell me what went wrong? It’s okay. I can take anything. Unless it’s something I did, or said, or am. ‘Cause those are, like, my buttons.\\
151 - Girl: No, it’s not any of that. It’s just, I kind of have a hard time around people I don’t know.\\
152 - Raj: Really? Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?\\
153 - Girl: I’ve been trying to force myself into situations that I’m not comfortable with. I saw the flyer in the store window, and I made myself go in. I don’t even like comic books.\\
154 - Raj: Yeah, me neither.\\
155 - Girl: Then what were you doing there?\\
156 - Raj: I lied. I love them. I only said that so you’d go out with me.\\
157 - Girl: Oh, you don’t want to do that. I’m kind of broken.\\
158 - Raj: That’s great. I’m broken, too.\\
159 - Girl: Oh, no, you’re not.\\
160 - Raj: Oh, I totally am. If it wasn’t for this beer, I couldn’t even talk to you right now. I’m a wreck. There are many things seriously wrong with me. And not quirks, either. Like, diagnosable psychological problems. Maybe brain damage.\\
161 - Girl: Well, how do I know you’re not just saying that?\\
162 - Raj: Go out with me on one date, and I promise you, you’ll see.\\
163 - Girl: Okay. Text me. Bye.\\
164 - Raj: You won’t regret it. I’m the most pathetic guy you’ve ever met. And that, boys and girls, is how it’s done.\\
165 - Scene: The theatre.\\
166 - Penny (as Blanche DuBois) : You love her very much, don’t you?\\
167 - Actor (as Mitch): Yes.\\
168 - Penny: I think you have a great capacity for devotion. You’ll be lonely when she passes on, won’t you? I understand what that is.\\
169 - Actor: To be lonely?\\
170 - Leonard: She’s pretty good, huh?\\
171 - Sheldon: She is. But when do they get to the part about streetcars?\\
172 - Penny (as Blanche): …when I was a very young girl. When I was 16 years old, I made the discovery, love. All at once, and much, much too completely. It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow. That’s how it struck the world for me. But I was unlucky. Deluded.\\
173 - Sheldon: She’s remarkable.\\
174 - Leonard: She really is.\\
175 - Amy: Our Penny’s a star.\\
176 - Sheldon: How can she remember all those lines, but as a waitress, she can’t remember no tomato on my hamburger?
\subsection {Episode 18: The Contractual Obligation Implementation}
1 - Scene: The apartment \\
2 - Leonard: Look, I know you guys don’t want to do this, but we have no choice. So, you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with.\\
3 - Howard: I got whine.\\
4 - Sheldon: I got the B word.\\
5 - Leonard: Yeah, well, it’s in our contract to serve on a university committee. And frankly, this is one I believe in. Okay, here we go. Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences.\\
6 - Howard: Come on, if I was any good at convincing women to do stuff, I wouldn’t have spent so much of my twenties in the shower.\\
7 - Sheldon: If you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our time.\\
8 - Leonard: Helping women? Y\\
9 - Sheldon: Helping anyone. People should take care of themselves.\\
10 - Leonard: Oh, like yesterday, when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?\\
11 - Sheldon: I’m not saying people can’t use tools. Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.\\
12 - Leonard: You don’t think it’s worthwhile to try to get more women working in science.\\
13 - Sheldon: I think that’s incredibly sexist of you. I believe in a gender-blind society like in Star Trek, where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals.\\
14 - Leonard: You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive, but a black lady still answered the space phone?\\
15 - Howard: Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time with Lieutenant Uhura.\\
16 - Sheldon: Howard’s disturbing recollections aside, I don’t appreciate being forced to do banal committee work.\\
17 - Leonard: Yes, I know, you’re too smart for this.\\
18 - Sheldon: Exactly. It’s like asking the Human Torch to heat up your frozen burrito.\\
19 - Leonard: Got it. All right, I’m thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process, is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names. Like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith.\\
20 - Sheldon: I suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials so as not to be pre-judged. Harry Potter’s J.K. Rowling, uh, Star Trek’s D.C. Fontana.\\
21 - Howard: Van Nuys pole-dancer D.D. Melons. All right, I think we’ve really helped women today. Let’s fire up the old Xbox.\\
22 - Leonard: Guys, please don’t make this a school project where I’m the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch.\\
23 - Sheldon: We’re not. This time you’re the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.\\
24 - Howard: So, you think I’m one of the smarter kids?\\
25 - Sheldon: No, you’re a tool I was using to make my point.\\
26 - Credits sequence.\\
27 - Scene: The apartment.\\
28 - Leonard: Guys, our topic is encouraging women in science, can you at least play a less sexist game\\
29 - Sheldon: How is it sexist? My character wields a battle axe as well as any man.\\
30 - Howard: Not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse a family of 30. And have enough milk left over to open a Baskin Robbins.\\
31 - Sheldon: Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner, I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town.\\
32 - Leonard: Sheldon, you’re always saying how much smarter you are than me. Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science.\\
33 - Sheldon: All your ideas address the issue at a university level. By then it’s too late. You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.\\
34 - Leonard: That’s actually good. Why didn’t I think of that?\\
35 - Sheldon: Some people are otters, some people are rocks.\\
36 - Leonard: I wonder if there’s a way we could give the idea a trial run.\\
37 - Howard: Maybe I could call my old middle school, see if we can talk to some of the female students.\\
38 - Leonard: That’s great, try to set up something for the three of us to go over there.\\
39 - Sheldon: Oh, hold on. While I’m comfortable speaking about science, I’m not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren. Better Google it.\\
40 - Howard: What exactly are you looking up?\\
41 - Sheldon: How do I get 12-year-old girls excited.\\
42 - Leonard and Howard (together): No!\\
43 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
44 - Raj: Thanks again for letting me crash girls’ night.\\
45 - Penny: Are you kidding? You brought fancy wine and made fondue. I’ve slept with guys for less. It’s a joke. Based on real events.\\
46 - Raj: Anyway, I was hoping I could, uh, pick your brains a little. I’m supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a killer first date.\\
47 - Amy: Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady n the face of danger, so I recommend an unsafe environment. Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks, picnic near a lunatic asylum, a wine tasting on Skid Row.\\
48 - Raj: Uh, Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues. Maybe we could start with something simpler.\\
49 - Bernadette: Why don’t you take her to Disneyland? You go on Space Mountain, you’re in the dark, she’s holding onto you.\\
50 - Penny: Yeah, but you just have to remember, that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end, so make sure you got your clothes back on. It’s a joke. Based on real events.\\
51 - Raj: Mm, Disneyland? I don’t know. With all the crowds and the weird characters walking around, just reminds me too much of India.\\
52 - Amy: I haven’t been to Disneyland since I was a kid. We should definitely go one weekend.\\
53 - Bernadette: Weekends are too crowded.\\
54 - Penny: So, blow off work, go on a weekday.\\
55 - Amy: Hooky? I’ve never played hooky in my life. My mom said that’s how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.\\
56 - Penny: It’s more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.\\
57 - Bernadette: Joke?\\
58 - Penny: I can laugh about it now.\\
59 - Bernadette: So, what do you say? This Friday we ditch work and go to Disneyland?\\
60 - Penny: I’m in.\\
61 - Amy: Me, too.\\
62 - Raj: Excuse me, I thought we were trying to solve my problem?\\
63 - Penny: Oh, yeah, right. Wait, what was your problem again?\\
64 - Raj: I am a man who can’t talk to women, trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can’t be around other people.\\
65 - Penny: Yeah, that’s a toughie.\\
66 - Bernadette: Let’s think.\\
67 - Amy: Hmm. We doing just Disney or California Adventure, too?\\
68 - Scene: A school hallway.\\
69 - Leonard: It’s nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students.\\
70 - Howard: Well, they’re actually pretty excited. I’m their most famous alum. If you don’t count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes.\\
71 - Sheldon: This must feel pretty good for you, coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut.\\
72 - Howard: Yeah, last time I was here, I was just a scrawny little nerd.\\
73 - Leonard: And now you’re also an astronaut.\\
74 - Howard: So many memories. I mean, how many times in these hallways was I tripped, punched and spit on? Oh, look, here’s my old locker. I have a masters in engineering and I still can’t figure out how Scott Kapinski got me and my briefcase to fit in there. (Kid bumps into him) Hey.\\
75 - Kid: What?\\
76 - Howard: Nothing.\\
77 - Sheldon: Smart. We don’t want any problems.\\
78 - Scene: Bernadette’s car.\\
79 - Amy: I can’t believe I ditched work for Disneyland.\\
80 - Bernadette: What did you tell your boss?\\
81 - Amy: Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages. At seven o’clock last night, I called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood. At nine thirty, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. At eleven thirty, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose. At twelve forty-five, I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now I’m going to Disneyland.\\
82 - Bernadette: Penny, what did you say?\\
83 - Penny: I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I said bye.\\
84 - Amy: So, what are we gonna do first?\\
85 - Bernadette: I don’t know about you guys, but I’m gonna make a beeline for the place that gives you a princess makeover.\\
86 - Amy: Ooh, that sounds like fun.\\
87 - Penny: You’re kidding, right? We’re not just gonna get drunk and go on rides?\\
88 - Amy: Come on, do it with us.\\
89 - Penny: All right, whatever. How does it work?\\
90 - Bernadette: Okay, so, you pick your princess, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Cinderella, they give you hair, makeup, the works.\\
91 - Penny: Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.\\
92 - Amy: Oh, I want to be Cinderella, too.\\
93 - Penny: Yeah.\\
94 - Bernadette: We can’t all be Cinderella.\\
95 - Amy: Then how do we decide?\\
96 - Bernadette: Well, it’s simple. This was my idea. I’m driving. I’m Cinderella. You bitches got a problem with that, we could stop the car right now.\\
97 - Scene: A library.\\
98 - Raj: Excuse me, I’m meeting a girl here. It’s kind of our first date.\\
99 - Man: In a library?\\
100 - Raj: She and I are both a little awkward in social situations, so this seemed like a good idea.\\
101 - Man: People say I’m a little awkward, too. May I join you?\\
102 - Raj: No, you can’t join us. Just go, go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from.\\
103 - Man (to Lucy): You can do better.\\
104 - Lucy: Oh, we’re eating here? (Reading) We’re having a texting date? (By text) I love that.\\
105 - Raj (by text): As you’re reading, it will help to remember I have an adorable accent.\\
106 - Scene: A classroom.\\
107 - Leonard: Okay, who’s ready for some science? Me, too. Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz, and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be. How cool, you ask? Well, how about negative 273 degrees, ’cause that’s the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it? What? All right. So now let’s bring out theoretical physicist Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\\
108 - Sheldon: Hello, female children. Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist. Polish-born, French-educated Madame Curie. Co-discoverer of radioactivity, she was a hero of science, until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. With a little hard work, I see no reason why that can’t happen to any of you. Are we done? Can we go?\\
109 - Later.\\
110 - Howard: The thing to remember is you can go to outer space, too. I mean, look at me. I went to this very school. Those desks you’re sitting in, I was once superglued to one of them.\\
111 - Girl: Did you go to the moon?\\
112 - Howard: No, but I did go to the International Space Station.\\
113 - Girl: Did you fly the rocket?\\
114 - Howard: No, but I was in the rocket. I didn’t actually…\\
115 - Girl: So you just flew around? That’s kind of like my uncle. He’s a flight attendant.\\
116 - Howard: No, I’m an American hero. Your uncle brings people nuts, okay?\\
117 - Leonard: Alright, alright. Boy, we are learning a lot here, huh? Thank you, astronaut Howard. Um, I am what’s called an experimental physicist, which is super-fun, because I get to test theories and work with lasers. Yes?\\
118 - Girl 2: How did you decide to become a scientist?\\
119 - Leonard: Uh, excellent question. Um, I suppose I’ve always been into science, you know. My mother and father are scientists, so I was kind of led in that direction. Uh, pushed might be a better way to describe it. To be honest with you guys, when I was your age, I wanted to be a rap star. Like Snoop Dogg, but with a healthy respect for the police. Yeah, no, sure, you laugh. Just like my mother did. After I confided, I was derided and chided, my moms and I collided. She said my dreams were misguided. That’s just a little freestyle.\\
120 - Scene: The library.\\
121 - Raj (by text): My dad’s a gynaecologist in India, so if you’re over there and need a check up, as he likes to say, he’s at your cervix.\\
122 - Lucy(by text): That’s terrible. Your dad should be sent to the pun-itentiary.\\
123 - Raj (by text): That’s a fitting pun-ishment. I still don’t know what you do for a living.\\
124 - Lucy (by text): Web design.\\
125 - Raj (by text): Anything I might have seen?\\
126 - Lucy (by text): I don’t know. You ever look at p0rn Web sites?\\
127 - Raj (by text): No, never. What is p0rn?\\
128 - Lucy (by text): Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say prom Web sites.\\
129 - Raj (by text): Ooh, fun. I love prom. The romance, the gowns, it’s like a fairy tale come to life. Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say, I like sports.\\
130 - Scene: The classroom.\\
131 - Leonard: I never wanted to play the cello. How do you meet girls playing the cello? Hey, you want to come over to my house and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?\\
132 - Howard: Quick, pull the fire alarm. Let’s get out of here.\\
133 - Sheldon: Uh, hello again. Um, yeah, I don’t know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences, but it’s clear you young women here, today, have been. While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time, it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now. Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler, are you there?\\
134 - Amy (voice): We’re here.\\
135 - Sheldon: Thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women.\\
136 - Amy: It’s our pleasure. I’m Dr. Fowler, and I’m a neuroscientist.\\
137 - Bernadette: And I’m Dr. Rostenkowski Wolowitz, and I’m a microbiologist.\\
138 - Amy: The world of science needs more women, but from a young age, we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look than about the power of our minds.\\
139 - Bernadette: That’s true. Every one of you has the capacity to be anything you want to be.\\
140 - Penny: Unless you want to be Cinderella.\\
141 - Bernadette: Come at me. See what happens.\\
142 - Scene: The library.\\
143 - Raj (by text): This was really fun.\\
144 - Lucy : My battery’s dying, so I’m just gonna talk. Thanks for today. I’ve been trying to do more things that scare me, and coming here was definitely one of them. But it was also really nice. So thanks, and, um, I’m gonna go. Maybe I could do one more scary thing before I go and give you a kiss good-bye? You know, if that’s okay. Okay. Panic attack. Maybe next time.\\
145 - Raj: I’m counting that as foreplay.\\
146 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
147 - Howard: Bernie, I’m home. You have fun today?\\
148 - Bernadette: Yes, and I have a surprise for you.\\
149 - Howard: Please be Cinderella. Please be Cinderella.\\
150 - Bernadette: Well, hello, Prince Charming.\\
151 - Howard: Milady.\\
152 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
153 - Leonard: Hey, how was your… what?\\
154 - Penny: I can explain. I played hooky with the girls, then we all went to Disneyland and got… What are you doing?\\
155 - Leonard (undressing): Disneyland. Go on, I’m listening.\\
156 - Scene: The apartment.\\
157 - Amy: Sheldon, all Snow White needs is one little kiss to wake up.\\
158 - Sheldon: Heard you the first time.
\subsection {Episode 19: The Closet Reconfiguration}
1 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
2 - Bernadette: What you doing?\\
3 - Howard: You said clean up. I’m cleaning up.\\
4 - Bernadette: You can’t just throw everything in the closet.\\
5 - Howard: Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can’t do both. This isn’t s*x.\\
6 - Bernadette: What if someone looks in there?\\
7 - Howard: They’re just coming over for dinner. No one’s gonna look in the closet.\\
8 - Bernadette: Well, you don’t know that. What if someone’s looking for the bathroom and they open that door?\\
9 - Howard: Could work out. For all we know there’s a toilet in there somewhere.\\
10 - Bernadette: Fine. But after tonight we need to get a handle on this mess.\\
11 - Howard: You know what we should do? We should show the closet to Sheldon.\\
12 - Bernadette: Why?\\
13 - Howard: Are you kidding? He’s like a savant at organizing. Everything in his apartment has a label on it. Including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. And if you look really close at that label maker label, you’ll see a label that says label.\\
14 - Bernadette: He’s our guest, we can’t just ask him to straighten our closet.\\
15 - Howard: No, we wouldn’t ask him. We’d just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there.\\
16 - Later.\\
17 - Howard: Hey, guys, come on in.\\
18 - All: Hi.\\
19 - Penny: Ooh, it smells good.\\
20 - Bernadette: Thanks. And, Sheldon, I know tonight’s the night you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch.\\
21 - Sheldon: Oh, you shouldn’t have.\\
22 - Bernadette: Oh, it’s my pleasure.\\
23 - Sheldon: No, you really shouldn’t have. I brought my own.\\
24 - Bernadette: You stopped and got him takeout?\\
25 - Leonard: I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.\\
26 - Bernadette: Sheldon, I’ve been cooking all day.\\
27 - Sheldon: Well, now don’t you feel silly.\\
28 - Bernadette: Show him the closet.\\
29 - Credits sequence.\\
30 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
31 - Raj: These spring rolls are amazing. Good job, Bernadette.\\
32 - Bernadette: That’s the takeout that Sheldon brought.\\
33 - Raj: Oh, well, I’m sure they wouldn’t have tasted nearly as good if I hadn’t tried your food first.\\
34 - Sheldon: Howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?\\
35 - Howard: Colour’s fine.\\
36 - Sheldon: Wrong, they’ll be arranged seasonally.\\
37 - Penny: Sheldon, aren’t you gonna spend a little time with Amy?\\
38 - Amy: Oh, it’s okay, I’m used to it. The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.\\
39 - Sheldon: Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami.\\
40 - Amy: His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please agree with me.\\
41 - Scene: The closet.\\
42 - Leonard: Sheldon, come on. It’s getting late. Time to go.\\
43 - Sheldon: Oh, five more minutes.\\
44 - Leonard: That’s what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny are already in the car. Let’s move it.\\
45 - Sheldon: How come I never get to do anything I want to do?\\
46 - Howard: You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home.\\
47 - Sheldon: Please, Leonard, he said it’s okay.\\
48 - Leonard: Sheldon, it’s, wait, I can go home without you? Bye.\\
49 - Sheldon: Howard, I have a few questions. I found three bowling pins. Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?\\
50 - Howard: Juggle.\\
51 - Sheldon: You health nuts kill me.\\
52 - Bernadette: Oh, my God, it’s beautiful. Look, he found the juggling pins I hid.\\
53 - Sheldon: Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it could either be filed…\\
54 - Howard: Whoa, you opened this?\\
55 - Sheldon: Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on the content…\\
56 - Howard: I couldn’t be less interested. Now, come on, I’ll take you home.\\
57 - Bernadette: Howard, don’t you want to know what’s in the letter?\\
58 - Howard: If I wanted to know, I would’ve opened it years ago. The closet looks great. Let’s get out of here.\\
59 - Sheldon: Wait, can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?\\
60 - Howard: Do whatever you want.\\
61 - Sheldon: Thanks. Oh. Great party.\\
62 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
63 - Leonard: You know, when I first met Howard, he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say, aw, I sat in gum.\\
64 - Penny: What is your point?\\
65 - Leonard: Well, it’s just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.\\
66 - Penny: Really? You couldn’t just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?\\
67 - Leonard: Trying to paint a picture.\\
68 - Penny: It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.\\
69 - Leonard: Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.\\
70 - Penny: Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?\\
71 - Leonard: Yeah. Although…\\
72 - Penny: No.\\
73 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
74 - Bernadette: Howie, you okay?\\
75 - Howard: Yeah, I just couldn’t sleep.\\
76 - Bernadette: Told you you shouldn’t have espresso after dinner. I know the little cups make you feel big, but it’s not worth it.\\
77 - Howard: It’s this stupid letter.\\
78 - Bernadette: Did you read it?\\
79 - Howard: No.\\
80 - Bernadette: You must be curious.\\
81 - Howard: Of course I’m curious. I haven’t seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid. And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? What’s that about?\\
82 - Bernadette: Why don’t you read it? Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.\\
83 - Howard: He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?\\
84 - Bernadette: I get that. So, what do you want to do with it?\\
85 - Howard: Something I should have done a long time ago. (Sets fire to it)\\
86 - Bernadette: Really? Are you sure?\\
87 - Howard: Yep.\\
88 - Bernadette: Feel better?\\
89 - Howard: I do. (Smoke alarm goes off) Great. Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.\\
90 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
91 - Amy: I can’t believe he set it on fire.\\
92 - Bernadette: Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. And he was already having a tough day ’cause he accidentally wore my pants to work. I don’t know why he was upset. They were bigger on him than me.\\
93 - Amy: Boy, I’m really curious what was in that letter.\\
94 - Bernadette: Me, too, but I guess now we’ll never know.\\
95 - Amy: Well, you said Sheldon read it. Why not ask him?\\
96 - Bernadette: I can’t do that. What kind of wife would I be if I didn’t respect my husband’s privacy?\\
97 - Penny: What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?\\
98 - Bermadette: That works.\\
99 - Penny: Okay.\\
100 - Scene: The laundry room.\\
101 - Sheldon: Bleuch. Like cleaning out the entire building’s belly button.\\
102 - Penny: Hey, Sheldon.\\
103 - Sheldon: Oh, hello. What can I do for you ladies?\\
104 - Amy: You have something we want.\\
105 - Sheldon: Oh, dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.\\
106 - Penny: No, we just want information.\\
107 - Sheldon: Oh. Oh, I’ve got that in spades. Ravage me.\\
108 - Penny: We heard you read the letter from Howard’s father.\\
109 - Sheldon: I did.\\
110 - Penny: What did it say?\\
111 - Sheldon: I can’t tell you that. I’m bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.\\
112 - Amy: Sheldon, that’s not a real thing.\\
113 - Sheldon: Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend’s hand at the movies. You know. That doesn’t stop you from pawing at me like you’re a bear and I’m a trash can full of sweets.\\
114 - Penny: Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.\\
115 - Sheldon: Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By happenstance, I came to know it. That doesn’t give me the right to disseminate it freely.\\
116 - Penny: Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette’s closet. Doesn’t that count for something?\\
117 - Sheldon: Are you pointing out that California is a community property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?\\
118 - Penny: Yeah, obviously.\\
119 - Sheldon: Well played. Sometimes I don’t give you enough credit, Penny.\\
120 - Scene: The apartment.\\
121 - Raj: Dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party.\\
122 - Leonard: Actually, all I did was invite you.\\
123 - Raj: Well, put your mind at ease. I’m here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard’s dinner party’s ass. Now, the first thing we need is a theme. I’m thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.\\
124 - Leonard: I’m thinking you need a testosterone patch. Penny and I just want to do something low-key. You know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors d’oeuvres.\\
125 - Raj: So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe’s? Hate to miss that.\\
126 - Leonard: Hey, where have you been?\\
127 - Sheldon: Oh, Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm, I’d say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.\\
128 - Leonard: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, you’ve been gone a long time.\\
129 - Sheldon: Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howard’s father.\\
130 - Leonard: What information?\\
131 - Sheldon: I can’t tell you that. I am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.\\
132 - Raj: Well, come on, we won’t tell anyone.\\
133 - Sheldon: Sorry, badgering me won’t work. What you should have said is, It’s pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us.\\
134 - Leonard: Fine, then that.\\
135 - Sheldon: All right, I’ll tell you. My goodness, everyone’s on their game today.\\
136 - Scene: The apartment kitchen.\\
137 - Amy: This is really fun.\\
138 - Raj: Yeah, it’s nice to get dressed up once in a while.\\
139 - Penny: Yeah, and the hors d’oeuvres are delightful.\\
140 - Leonard: As is the company.\\
141 - Penny: Aw.\\
142 - Sheldon: My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.\\
143 - Leonard: Hey, uh, listen, everybody. Before Howard gets here, et’s all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father.\\
144 - Raj: Of course.\\
145 - Penny: Sure.\\
146 - Amy: Absolutely.\\
147 - Sheldon: If I say yes, can we turn off that Latin orgy music?\\
148 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
149 - Howard: Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.\\
150 - Bernadette: Yeah, try doing it in heels.\\
151 - Howard: I am.\\
152 - Bernadette: Wait. There’s something I have to tell you.\\
153 - Howard: What?\\
154 - Bernadette: I know what was in your dad’s letter.\\
155 - Howard: Sheldon, I swear to God, I’m gonna kill you.\\
156 - Amy: Hey.\\
157 - Bernadette: I made him tell us.\\
158 - Howard: What? Us? Who else knows?\\
159 - Penny: I know.\\
160 - Amy: Me, too.\\
161 - Leonard: Same here.\\
162 - Raj: Shame on all of you.\\
163 - Leonard: You know, too.\\
164 - Raj: Couldn’t leave him one friend, could you?\\
165 - Howard: So everybody knows what’s in that letter except for me?\\
166 - Sheldon: Yes, it’s six against one. Stand down, sir.\\
167 - Howard: How could you do this?\\
168 - Bernadette: I’m sorry.\\
169 - Raj: If you want, we could tell you.\\
170 - Howard: No, I don’t want to know. I mean, I do, but… I got to go.\\
171 - Amy: Use me as a human shield!\\
172 - Sheldon: I panicked. He looked taller than usual.\\
173 - Scene: The closet.\\
174 - Bernadette (off): Howard?\\
175 - Howard: In here.\\
176 - Bernadette: I’m sorry. I should have left it alone.\\
177 - Howard: It’s okay. Sorry I ran off like that.\\
178 - Bernadette: What are you looking at?\\
179 - Howard: Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.\\
180 - Bernadette: That’s nice.\\
181 - Howard: I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look at this. Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever. Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows. Neither race was happy to see me with those.\\
182 - Bernadette: Think you could take a break?\\
183 - Howard: Why?\\
184 - Bernadette: Got a little surprise for you. Come on.\\
185 - Howard: Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have s*x tonight. I’ll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but… Oh. What are you guys doing here?\\
186 - Leonard: When you left, you weren’t sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad’s letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution.\\
187 - Howard: Oh, yeah, what’s that?\\
188 - Sheldon: It’s simple, really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. The, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once.\\
189 - Penny: We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of the elephant in the room, so…\\
190 - Sheldon: Anyway, um, I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don’t tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.\\
191 - Penny: Yeah. And I said if it wasn’t epistemic, we might as well not do it.\\
192 - Bernadette: Sit down, honey.\\
193 - Leonard: Raj, you’re up.\\
194 - Raj: Okay, um, It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said, Happy birthday, Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh, and it was a Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks it’s a fly. Silly frog. So funny.\\
195 - Leonard: Sheldon.\\
196 - Sheldon: It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.\\
197 - Howard: Nice try. That’s the plot for Goonies.\\
198 - Amy: Told you.\\
199 - Sheldon: Don’t.\\
200 - Leonard: Amy.\\
201 - Amy: You didn’t know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. And he cried because he was so proud of you.\\
202 - Howard: Really?\\
203 - Sheldon: Or that’s complete poppycock which Amy made up. It still could be the map.\\
204 - Leonard: Penny.\\
205 - Penny: It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn’t who he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.\\
206 - Sheldon: I would like to change mine. The pirate’s name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now it’s completely different from Goonies.\\
207 - Amy: No, it’s not.\\
208 - Sheldon: Don’t.\\
209 - Leonard: Okay, my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did.\\
210 - Howard: Hmm.\\
211 - Leonard: Bernadette.\\
212 - Bernadette: Inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born. On the back he wrote Howard, my son, my greatest gift. You okay?\\
213 - Howard: Yeah. I’m terrific.\\
214 - Leonard: So, which one do you think it is, matey?\\
215 - Howard: Actually, I don’t want to know. I want all of them to be true.\\
216 - Leonard: Well, one of them is.\\
217 - Howard: That’s pretty cool. Thank you, guys.\\
218 - Penny: Hey, it’s still early. Why don’t we go back and have that party?\\
219 - Raj: Yeah,\\
220 - Leonard: Yeah, cool.\\
221 - Amy: Okay.\\
222 - Sheldon: You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn’t the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadette’s diary has some saucy passages.\\
223 - Bernadette: Sheldon, don’t you dare.\\
224 - Sheldon: There’s nothing to worry about. Your secret’s safe with me.\\
225 - Bernadette: That’s more like it.\\
226 - Sheldon: Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.\\
227 - Scene: The apartment.\\
228 - Bernadette: Glad you’re feeling better.\\
229 - Howard: Me, too. If I’d known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats.\\
230 - Penny: This turned out pretty well, huh?\\
231 - Leonard: Yeah, I think so.\\
232 - Raj: I agree. That is, if you’ve never been to or heard of a party before.\\
233 - Amy: If you’d let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you’d be happy all the time.\\
234 - Sheldon: Uh, Penny, I, I have a couple of questions about your closet. Is there any reason you’re keeping this dead goldfish?\\
235 - Penny: Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.\\
236 - Sheldon: Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.\\
237 - Penny: Party’s over! Party’s over!
\subsection {Episode 20: The Tenure Turbulence}
1 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
2 - Leonard: I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies. Instead, it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again.\\
3 - Howard: We thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted to an asexual state, but the lawsuit from his Jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong.\\
4 - Leonard: My point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real.\\
5 - Raj: Only if you’re this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.\\
6 - Sheldon: If I could keep my Gmail account, I’d be okay with that.\\
7 - Barry: – Hewwo, fewwas.\\
8 - All: Hey.\\
9 - Barry: Wemember when we were twying to figuwe out what that smell coming fwom Pwofessor Tupperman’s office was?\\
10 - Howard: Yeah?\\
11 - Barry: Turns out it was Tupperman. Dead at his desk for two weeks.\\
12 - Howard: That’s terrible.\\
13 - Leonard: Oh, my God.\\
14 - Barry: In wieu of fwowers, the department chair is asking that evewyone donate a bottle of Febweze.\\
15 - Sheldon: If we’re going to change the topic from jellyfish, I’d be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle.\\
16 - Howard: Show a little compassion, a man died.\\
17 - Barry: And turned into a puddew of goo. Now, we can either sit awound and cwy over spilt pwofessor, or we can wejoice in the knowwedge that a tenured position has just opened up. I choose to do the watter.\\
18 - Sheldon: Excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous. A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent. If we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid.\\
19 - Raj: Well, I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure.\\
20 - Sheldon: Pchew!\\
21 - Barry: If you need my nose, you’ll find it firmwy wodged up the qectum of the tenure committee.\\
22 - Howard: You Ph.D’s gonna go suck up like Kripke?\\
23 - Leonard: No. I mean, I’ll apply, but I’m not gonna stoop to playing politics.\\
24 - Raj: Yeah, me neither. It should be about the work. And if I can’t get tenure, I’d like to see you or Sheldon get it.\\
25 - Sheldon: Raj, don’t dangle false hope in front of Leonard like that.\\
26 - Leonard: Excuse me, but I think I’m just as qualified as you are.\\
27 - Sheldon: Pchew! Pchew! Pchew! Pchew!\\
28 - Credits sequence.\\
29 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
30 - Penny: So tenured means a job for life?\\
31 - Leonard: Yup.\\
32 - Penny: You can’t get fired even if you’re bad at it?\\
33 - Leonard: Mm, not really.\\
34 - Penny: Wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.\\
35 - Scene: The apartment.\\
36 - Sheldon: While I disagree with the premise of tenure, if they gave it to me, it wouldn’t diminish my output. You know, I’m like the sun. Can’t turn this off.\\
37 - Amy: Are Rajesh and Leonard competing for it as well?\\
38 - Sheldon: Mm-hmm.\\
39 - Amy: Do they know they don’t stand a chance ’cause you’re so great?\\
40 - Sheldon: Well put. You know, I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running.\\
41 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
42 - Raj: It would be nice to have the increased income. Stop taking money from my parents.\\
43 - Howard: Money from family does come with strings attached.\\
44 - Raj: You have no idea. They buy me a new BMW for my birthday but can I get seat warmers? No. Rajesh, if you want a warm butt, you’re gonna have to pay for it yourself. Well, maybe I will, old man.\\
45 - Bernadette: I think that’s enough wine for now.\\
46 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
47 - Leonard: I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech.\\
48 - Penny: She’d be proud, huh?\\
49 - Leonard: Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call.\\
50 - Scene: The apartment.\\
51 - Sheldon: My primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact. I might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow. Or a chainsaw.\\
52 - Amy: Or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out, buy a house, get married. start a family.\\
53 - Sheldon: Or, the chainsaw.\\
54 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
55 - Raj: And I will return to New Delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled white elephant. And you know what will be on that elephant’s back? A seat warmer. No, Father, you may not have a ride.\\
56 - Bernadette: I’m gonna make some coffee.\\
57 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
58 - Penny: So, who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?\\
59 - Leonard: I’m not gonna schmooze anybody. I’m gonna let my work speak for itself.\\
60 - Penny: That’s great. That shows a lot of integrity.\\
61 - Leonard: Thank you. I’m a naive idiot, right?\\
62 - Penny: Oh, good, you heard me.\\
63 - Scene: The apartment.\\
64 - Amy: You know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision.\\
65 - Sheldon: Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.\\
66 - Amy: You don’t say.\\
67 - Sheldon: But I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to know who’s on the committee. Let’s see. Oh, Janine Davis. Oh, dear.\\
68 - Amy: Is that a problem?\\
69 - Sheldon: Well…\\
70 - (Flashback to Series 6, Episode 12, The Egg Salad Equivalency)\\
71 - Sheldon: Even you. You’re a slave.\\
72 - Janine: I’m a what?\\
73 - (End of flashback)\\
74 - Sheldon: I’m not sure, it could go either way.\\
75 - Scene: The university gymnasium.\\
76 - Leonard: Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey. Mrs. Davis.\\
77 - Janine: Hey.\\
78 - Leonard: Hey.\\
79 - Janine: Dr. Hofstadter.\\
80 - Leonard: Yeah. Just thought I’d come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season.\\
81 - Janine: Good for you.\\
82 - Leonard: Not that you need it. I bet you look great in a swimsuit.\\
83 - Janine: Thank you.\\
84 - Leonard: I’ve got what my father used to call furniture disease. My chest is falling into my drawers. I’m not, uh, familiar with this model. How do I make it start?\\
85 - Janine: You push start.\\
86 - Leonard: Right. This one might be broken.\\
87 - Janine: You have to move.\\
88 - Leonard: Got it. Oh. There. Oh, yeah. Yeah, now I’m feeling it. Oh, this is great. I could do this for the rest of my life. Hey, speaking, speaking of things you do for the rest of your life, uh, did I read that you’re on that-that tenure committee?\\
89 - Janine: Yep. I got to get a home gym.\\
90 - Leonard: Well, I’m sure you have a lot of good applicants, I just wanted to say hi and let you know that I’ll be throwing my hat in the ring.\\
91 - Janine: All right, I’ll keep an eye out for that.\\
92 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
93 - Barry: Hey, Hofstadter. Funny seeing you here for the first time in… ever.\\
94 - Leonard: Go away.\\
95 - Barry: Janine the Machine, wet’s do this!\\
96 - Janine: Hey, Barry.\\
97 - Leonard: Well, look at that. Burned a whole calorie.\\
98 - Barry: I guess you got here ewwy to burn off that banana bwead I baked you.\\
99 - Janine: Yeah, it was delicious. Thank you.\\
100 - Barry: No, my pweasure.\\
101 - Leonard: Oh, if you, if you like banana bread, I’ve got a-a great recipe. The trick is in, in fresh ground, I’ll e-mail it to you.\\
102 - Barry: Aw wight, I’m warm. Weady to kick it up a notch?\\
103 - Janine: Let’s go.\\
104 - Leonard: That’s enough cardio for me. I’m just gonna stretch out before I hit the weights.\\
105 - Janine: You okay?\\
106 - Leonard: Call someone.\\
107 - Scene: Janine’s office. There is a sound on her computer. It opens up an online video.\\
108 - Raj: Good day, Mrs. Davis. This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali from the astrophysics department. Don’t be alarmed, I’m not really in space. Anyhoo, I’d like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself, so sit back, relax and enjoy the following 90-minute video.\\
109 - Janine: Oh, come on.\\
110 - Raj: Born in New Delhi, the third son of an itinerant gynecologist, I showed early signs of genius. At the age of five I discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon.\\
111 - Shelldon (off): (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis?\\
112 - Janine: God, they’re everywhere. Come in. Dr. Cooper, how can I help you?\\
113 - Sheldon: Yes, hello. I’m fine. Um, I understand you may have a bad impression of me, so I bought you a gift.\\
114 - Janine: Uh, Dr. Cooper, that’s not necessary.\\
115 - Sheldon: It’s too late. Get ready to like me.\\
116 - Janine: Roots?\\
117 - Sheldon: The tragic history of slavery in America. Fun for the whole family.\\
118 - Janine: Why would you think this is an appropriate gift?\\
119 - Sheldon: Um… Well… You are black, right?\\
120 - Janine: This meeting has come to an end.\\
121 - Sheldon: Because you want to start watching it right now. Copy that. Let’s see. Up next on the tenure committee is Professor Wu. Well, get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan.\\
122 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
123 - Leonard: Gentlemen.\\
124 - Raj: Where have you been?\\
125 - Leonard: Nurse’s office.\\
126 - Howard: Asthma attack?\\
127 - Leonard: Asthma, heart, some kind of attack. I’m fine, though.\\
128 - Howard: You guys going to Professor Tupperman’s memorial?\\
129 - Raj: I don’t know.\\
130 - Leonard: Probably not.\\
131 - Sheldon: Barely knew him.\\
132 - Howard: Yeah, you wouldn’t want to look like you guys are brown-nosing the tenure committee, who will all be there. Oh, yeah, that’s what I was hoping for, meerkats.\\
133 - Scene: The apartment.\\
134 - Sheldon: I won’t be able to make our date night this Thursday, so, bad news for you.\\
135 - Amy: Well you better have a good excuse this time, because trimming Q-tips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense.\\
136 - Sheldon: First of all, when you say things like that, people think you’re crazy. Second, the reason I’m cancelling is because I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman.\\
137 - Amy: It sounds like a long and tedious evening.\\
138 - Sheldon: Eh, it will be. Honestly, if I must endure a long and tedious evening, I’d rather it be with you on date night. But I have no choice. The tenure committee’s going to be there.\\
139 - Amy: Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along.\\
140 - Sheldon: Well, now that I think about it, that would be most helpful.\\
141 - Amy: Of course it would. I’m well-versed in academic politics, and as a respected scientist, I can only raise your stock as a candidate.\\
142 - Sheldon: Actually, I meant you could drive me. But if it makes you happy, that other stuff, too.\\
143 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
144 - Leonard: Do anything interesting today?\\
145 - Penny: Oh, not really. I was out shopping with Amy. She wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing.\\
146 - Leonard: Wait, Sheldon’s going to be there? We all promised we weren’t going to go.\\
147 - Penny: Oh, what a jerk.\\
148 - Leonard: I know. I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.\\
149 - Penny: Well, since Amy’s going, do you want me there? You know, to support you?\\
150 - Leonard: Oh, that’s nice, but it-it’s just gonna be a room full of boring old men and I’m not sure how much help you’d be.\\
151 - Penny: Okay. I’m just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.\\
152 - Leonard: Oh, yeah. No. Thanks, that would be great help. You realize you might kill some of them.\\
153 - Penny: Oh, then you all can get tenure.\\
154 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
155 - Raj: Come on, Daddy. All the other scientists have seat warmers. This is so humiliating. I’ve got to get tenure. Okay, let’s meet halfway. How about I cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week? Looks like we’re both going to be living like animals.\\
156 - Scene: The memorial.\\
157 - Amy: Let’s go over our emotional responses one last time.\\
158 - Sheldon: Okay.\\
159 - Amy: Professor Tupperman is dead, and that makes us?\\
160 - Sheldon: Sad.\\
161 - Amy: The fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn’t make us cranky and claustrophobic. It makes us?\\
162 - Sheldon: Glad.\\
163 - Amy: Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of Roots was?\\
164 - Sheldon: Bad. However…\\
165 - Amy: No.\\
166 - Sheldon: Fine. Bad.\\
167 - Raj: Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.\\
168 - Sheldon: You’re here.\\
169 - Raj: Excuse me. I’m here to pay my respects to Professor Tupperware, or whatever his name is.\\
170 - Sheldon: So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.\\
171 - Leonard: Well, well, well, Sheldon, fancy meeting you here. I guess the train store in Glendale wasn’t having a cotillion after all. And you, you said you weren’t coming here, either.\\
172 - Raj: I have a thick accent. You don’t know what I said.\\
173 - Amy: I’d like to know why Penny’s here.\\
174 - Penny: I’m here to support my man, just like you.\\
175 - Sheldon: What are you going to do? Take people’s drink orders and get them wrong?\\
176 - Leonard: Do it.\\
177 - Sheldon: What? Did she do it yet?\\
178 - Amy: She plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further Leonard’s cause.\\
179 - Sheldon: Well, that’s a fine how-do-you-do. Don’t just stand there. Take your breasts out.\\
180 - Howard: Ooh, meerkat fight!\\
181 - Amy: You’re all wasting your time. Sheldon is the most qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosom’s going to change that. Seriously, is that tape? Like, how are they staying up like that?\\
182 - Leonard: Way to hit ‘em with both barrels.\\
183 - Raj: You two should be ashamed of yourselves. Using women to advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever Amy plans on doing.\\
184 - Sheldon: Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?\\
185 - Raj: Yes.\\
186 - Sheldon: Okay, because that was not clear.\\
187 - Amy: Sheldon!\\
188 - Sheldon: What? That was ambiguous.\\
189 - Raj: Well, now it’s biguous. What are you gonna do about it?\\
190 - Sheldon: Um…\\
191 - Howard: You could talk some smack about his mother.\\
192 - Sheldon: Well, yes, of course, he wouldn’t like that at all. Last night, I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother.\\
193 - Leonard: Okay, okay. Guys, what are we doing here?\\
194 - Sheldon: I don’t know what you’re doing, but I was about to insinuate that I had coitus with Raj’s mother for a dollar.\\
195 - Leonard: Oh, you do what you want, but I don’t want to lose my friends over tenure. Friends are forever.\\
196 - Howard: So is tenure.\\
197 - Bernadette: Walk.\\
198 - Leonard: I’m just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself.\\
199 - Raj: You’re right. This is beneath me. Lie your mother was last night.\\
200 - Leonard: How about it, Sheldon?\\
201 - Sheldon: What do you think I should do?\\
202 - Amy: Well, you’ll always be an academic success, but I seriously question whether you’ll make any more friends.\\
203 - Sheldon: I don’t want any more, but let’s go.\\
204 - Barry: Are you kidding? I would wove to baby-sit for you.\\
205 - Janine: I could not ask you to do that.\\
206 - Barry: Nonsense. Childwen wove me. Something about me just makes them waugh and waugh.\\
207 - Leonard: No. We cannot lose to that jerk.\\
208 - Raj: Yeah, screw it. I’m going in.\\
209 - Sheldon: Wait. Hold on. I believe screw it, I’m going in is what I said to your mother last night. Don’t worry, I didn’t really say that. I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting.\\
210 - Amy: Should have taken my breasts out while I had the chance.\\
211 - Scene: Janine’s office.\\
212 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? I know you’re in there. I saw your car in the parking lot.\\
213 - Janine: What?\\
214 - Sheldon: I just found out that you recommended myself, Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure.\\
215 - Janine: Well, despite your quirks, the three of you are very accomplished in your respective fields.\\
216 - Sheldon: I don’t know what you mean by quirks, but, um, I do want to express my gratitude.\\
217 - Janine: You didn’t bring another gift, did you?\\
218 - Sheldon: No, no. No, I learned my lesson. I understand that was inappropriate.\\
219 - Janine: Good.\\
220 - Sheldon: Anyway, thank you.\\
221 - Janine: You’re welcome. (Sheldon attempts a jive handshake) I’m gonna pretend that didn’t happen.\\
222 - Sheldon: Yeah, right on, sister.
\subsection {Episode 21: The Closure Alternative}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Sheldon: Oh, dear. Penny, have you been recording shows on our DVR again?\\
3 - Penny: No.\\
4 - Sheldon: Answer honestly. This is not a trial. That’ll come later.\\
5 - Penny: Absolutely not. Help me out here, I can’t afford another demerit.\\
6 - Leonard: Yeah. Uh, maybe we were hacked. You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately.\\
7 - Sheldon: Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart: Mall Cop?\\
8 - Leonard: I don’t know. It’s a fat guy on a Segway. That’s funny everywhere.\\
9 - Sheldon: I’m deleting it.\\
10 - Penny: Well, hang on. Maybe the Chinese haven’t finished watching it yet.\\
11 - Leonard: You know, if you’re trying to make space on the DVR, why don’t you just get rid of some of the stuff you’ve already watched? Like, um, Alphas.\\
12 - Sheldon: No, that’s the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. I’m going to re-watch it before season three starts.\\
13 - Leonard: There is no season three. They cancelled that show.\\
14 - Sheldon: Well, they can’t cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger.\\
15 - Leonard: They did.\\
16 - Penny: Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?\\
17 - Sheldon: Dumplings? Don’t you understand what’s going on here?\\
18 - Penny: As a rule, no.\\
19 - Sheldon: That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh, now I’ll never know what happened.\\
20 - Penny: Well, why don’t you make up your own ending?\\
21 - Sheldon: Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I’ll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, I’ll rub pudding on my gums. I’m going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for.\\
22 - Leonard: Oh, please, don’t do that.\\
23 - Sheldon: No. They can’t just cancel a show like Alphas. You know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.\\
24 - Penny: I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.\\
25 - Leonard: Ah, don’t. If they didn’t want to be yelled at by crazy nerds, they shouldn’t have started a sci-fi channel.\\
26 - Credits sequence\\
27 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
28 - Howard: I think you’re gonna be really happy with this security camera. The optics are great, it’s got infrared technology, and there’s even a backup battery when the power goes out.\\
29 - Raj: Whatever. I can see my little princess while I’m at work, right?\\
30 - Howard: Why can’t you just watch p0rn like a regular guy? I need your laptop so I can configure the software.\\
31 - Raj: Wait, hold on. This is weird.\\
32 - Howard: What?\\
33 - Raj: I was Googling that girl I’ve been dating, and I found her blog.\\
34 - Howard: Cool. Anything juicy?\\
35 - Raj: She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger? And he’s Indian? And he’s an astrophysicist, too?\\
36 - Howard: You know what’s going on, don’t you?\\
37 - Raj: Yes, Mummy was right. American girls are sexually voracious devils.\\
38 - Howard: I can’t believe I have to explain this. People change names on blogs to protect their privacy. Roger is Raj.\\
39 - Raj: Oh. I always thought, if I had a white name, it would be Gavin.\\
40 - Howard: Keep reading. What does it say?\\
41 - Raj: No, no, I don’t know if I should. If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would’ve told me. It’s almost like I’m reading her diary.\\
42 - Howard: It’s exactly what it’s like. Keep reading.\\
43 - Raj: No, this is creepy.\\
44 - Howard: Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when I put up that camera.\\
45 - Raj: It’s not creepy. Don’t listen to him. Oh, look who’s got the sweetest kisses.\\
46 - Howard: Should I go?\\
47 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
48 - Leonard: With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbacca’s. You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us. It’s got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this. What do you say?\\
49 - Penny: It’s six thirty in the morning.\\
50 - Leonard: I thought you grew up on a farm.\\
51 - Scene: The apartment.\\
52 - Sheldon (on phone): Hello, SyFy Network? Yeah, this is your vice president of programming. Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas. Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them it’s me, and I don’t want to answer a lot of questions about if I really am who I say I am, you know? I just. I want this done. No, I am not the person who just called. That man was clearly a cowboy. Yeah, who was plumb concerned about y’all cancelling his favourite show. Why do they keep hanging up on me?\\
53 - Amy: I’m sorry you’re upset. You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this.\\
54 - Sheldon: I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.\\
55 - Amy: Okay. Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure.\\
56 - Sheldon: Oh, that’s nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I don’t care how they end.\\
57 - Amy: You know, I might be able to help you with this. There’s a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less.\\
58 - Sheldon: Yeah, but I just told you, I don’t have a problem with closure.\\
59 - Amy: You sure about that?\\
60 - Sheldon: Oh, quite sure. (Amy starts a knocking sequence on the table. After staring at her a moment, Sheldon completes it.) That proves nothing.\\
61 - Scene: Raj’s office.\\
62 - Howard: Ready to go to lunch?\\
63 - Raj: Do you think I’m feminine?\\
64 - Howard: Yeah. Let’s go.\\
65 - Raj: Thanks a lot.\\
66 - Howard: What’s going on?\\
67 - Raj: I broke down, and I read Lucy’s blog, and in one of the entries she said, when we first met, I struck her as a little feminine.\\
68 - Howard: Just a little? That’s great.\\
69 - Raj: I have to talk to her about this.\\
70 - Howard: Oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about things? Listen to me, if she’s writing about your relationship, use it to your advantage. Rig the game.\\
71 - Raj: Well, that doesn’t seem fair.\\
72 - Howard: Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?\\
73 - Raj: No, it’s not. I’ve always thought that was unfair.\\
74 - Howard: So take what’s in that blog and use it to get her pants off.\\
75 - Raj: Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn’t you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?\\
76 - Howard: The key to her heart. That’s nice. Were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?\\
77 - Raj: I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women, Sir Elton John.\\
78 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
79 - Leonard: So, did you love it? Of course you loved it. How could you not love it? Tell me how much you loved it.\\
80 - Penny: It was cute.\\
81 - Leonard: Oh, don’t say cute. That’s the worst.\\
82 - Penny: What’s wrong with cute?\\
83 - Leonard: It just makes things seem small. It diminishes them.\\
84 - Penny: So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?\\
85 - Leonard: You can try, but nobody’s gonna believe you. I just, I don’t understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it.\\
86 - Penny: I liked it. I’m excited.\\
87 - Leonard: Well, then, tell your face.\\
88 - Penny: What do you want from me?\\
89 - Leonard: You know what? Never mind. We gave it a shot. Let’s just see what else is on.\\
90 - Penny: Oh, come on, don’t be like that.\\
91 - Leonard: Well…\\
92 - Penny: I’m sorry I called it cute. Let’s watch another one.\\
93 - Leonard: Really?\\
94 - Penny: Yeah, it was fun. Kind of reminded me of my high school. But instead of vampires, we had meth heads. But both came out at night and had messed up teeth.\\
95 - Leonard: All right, cool. I think you’ll like the next one better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.\\
96 - Penny: Oh. Well, that’s like my high school, too. But instead of a curse, it was crabs.\\
97 - Scene: The apartment.\\
98 - Amy: I’ve come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure.\\
99 - Sheldon: I take issue with the word compulsive.\\
100 - Amy: All I’m saying is, we live in a world where closure isn’t always an op…\\
101 - Sheldon: …tion. Okay. For the sake of argument, let’s say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?\\
102 - Amy: I’m going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isn’t so overwhelming.\\
103 - Sheldon: By playing tic-tac-toe?\\
104 - Amy: Yep. Your turn.\\
105 - Sheldon: Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. Especially since I’m about to win. (She wipes the board clean.) B-But we didn’t finish.\\
106 - Amy: Exactly. How does that make you feel?\\
107 - Sheldon: The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.\\
108 - Amy: And that’s exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.\\
109 - Sheldon: Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off.\\
110 - Amy: Come on, you can do this.\\
111 - Sheldon: You don’t know what it’s like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.\\
112 - Amy: Yeah, sounds like a drag.\\
113 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
114 - Penny: Okay, help me out here. Why does he love this show so much?\\
115 - Bernadette: Well, there was action, it was funny. I mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl, but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?\\
116 - Penny: Yippee, it’s backwards. I get it.\\
117 - Bernadette: Why does this bother you so much?\\
118 - Penny: I don’t know. It’s just, he’s so passionate about so many different things. I just don’t get that way. Do you?\\
119 - Bernadette: Well, sure. I’m pretty passionate about science. I remember the first time I looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms. It was like a whole other universe. If I wanted to, I could wipe it out with my thumb like a god.\\
120 - Penny: See? I wish I had some of that fire in my life. I mean, I want to care about things and get excited like you guys.\\
121 - Bernadette: Well, there’s no reason you can’t.\\
122 - Penny: You think?\\
123 - Bernadette: Absolutely. All we need to do is spend a little time and find something you’re passionate about.\\
124 - Penny: Ugh, that sounds like a lot of work.\\
125 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
126 - Howard (on webcam): Hey, what’s up?\\
127 - Raj: Uh, Lucy’s coming over. I need some advice.\\
128 - Howard: However long you think the foreplay should be, triple it.\\
129 - Raj: Just tell me which one you think is more manly. This hockey jersey or this football jersey.\\
130 - Howard: I don’t know. Go with hockey.\\
131 - Raj: Good, black is more slimming. Oh, that’s her. I got to go be butch. Toodles. Hey.\\
132 - Lucy: Hi.\\
133 - Raj: Come in.\\
134 - Lucy: Oh, look how cute your little doggy is.\\
135 - Raj: Yeah, well, I wouldn’t get too close. If I give the right command in German, she’ll rip your face off.\\
136 - Scene: The apartment. Montage of scenes.\\
137 - 1. Amy (singing): O’er the land of the free, and the home of the… Next.\\
138 - 2. (Sheldon is laying out an intricate pattern of dominoes) Amy: That’s quite an impressive layout, isn’t it?\\
139 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
140 - Amy: Let’s box it up.\\
141 - Sheldon: Let’s box it up.\\
142 - 3. (Sheldon is turning the handle on a jack-in-the-box. Just before the end of the tune)Amy: That’s enough. Sheldon, Sheldon, give it!\\
143 - 4. Amy: Okay, Sheldon, make a wish and blow out the candles. Oops, missed one. Now your wish can’t come true.\\
144 - Sheldon: Lucky for you, ’cause I wished you were dead.\\
145 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
146 - Lucy: I like your jersey.\\
147 - Raj: Thanks. I love hockey.\\
148 - Lucy: Oh, cool. So does my dad. We watched it all the time growing up. Who’s your favourite player?\\
149 - Raj: Not Brian Boitano, that’s for sure. How’s your burrito?\\
150 - Lucy: It’s still a little frozen in the middle.\\
151 - Raj: Probably because I didn’t read the instructions. No wrapper’s going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is Jay-Z.\\
152 - Lucy: Is something going on?\\
153 - Raj: What do you mean?\\
154 - Lucy: Well, you’re acting all weird, and I’m pretty weird, so I think I know what I’m talking about.\\
155 - Raj: I don’t know. Maybe it’s all those steroids I’ve been taking.\\
156 - Lucy: I think I’m gonna go. Thank you for the burrito and the pork rinds and the 20-minute lecture on why monster trucks are better than regular trucks.\\
157 - Raj: Wait, wait. I, I found your blog here you wrote about me.\\
158 - Lucy: Oh. I kind of just write that for myself. I didn’t think anybody actually read it.\\
159 - Raj: No kidding. You didn’t make it easy to find. I spent hours digging around online. For the record, you have excellent credit scores. And your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine.\\
160 - Lucy: Why were you acting so strange tonight?\\
161 - Raj: You called me feminine. And I, I wanted you to think I was more manly.\\
162 - Lucy: Raj, I didn’t say feminine was a bad thing. I meant that you’re sweet and thoughtful and your skin looks so much like caramel, I just want to dip an apple in your face.\\
163 - Raj: I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturising regimen.\\
164 - Lucy: So, are you okay?\\
165 - Raj: Yeah.\\
166 - Lucy: Good. Do you even like hockey?\\
167 - Raj: No. Bought this at the Staples Center when I went to see Taylor Swift.\\
168 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
169 - Penny: So, I was thinking how excited you get about stuff like Buffy or science or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy.\\
170 - Leonard: The Harmony One was fine. We didn’t need to upgrade to the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand.\\
171 - Penny: See, that’s the kind of passion I didn’t think I had. But then I realized I’m passionate about you.\\
172 - Leonard: Oh, my cute little tushy strikes again.\\
173 - Penny: No, I’m serious. Look, I’ve always had these plans. I was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life, and anything less than that just wasn’t worth getting excited about.\\
174 - Leonard: Those things can still happen.\\
175 - Penny: Oh, obviously it’s gonna happen. Yeah, a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so. Anyway, what I meant was, I shouldn’t wait, you know? I’ve got you, I’ve got Sheldon, all these wonderful friends. My life is exciting right now.\\
176 - Leonard: That’s a big deal.\\
177 - Penny: It is, isn’t it?\\
178 - Leonard: So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?\\
179 - Penny: Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke.\\
180 - Scene: The apartment.\\
181 - Sheldon: Amy, I must say, I was sceptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening.\\
182 - Amy: I’m a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.\\
183 - Sheldon: Well, you’re an excellent neuroscientist, you’re a wonderful girlfriend, and…\\
184 - Amy: And?\\
185 - Sheldon: Doesn’t matter, does it?\\
186 - Amy: I’m proud of you, Sheldon. (Exits.)\\
187 - Sheldon: And a complete sucker.\\
188 - (Montage of sccenes)\\
189 - 1. (Redraws tic-tac-toe board) Sheldon: Oh, yeah.\\
190 - 2. (Blows out all candles on the cake)\\
191 - 3. (Winds up jack-in-the-box until it pops out.) Sheldon: There he is.\\
192 - 4. Sheldon (singing): And the home of the brave.\\
193 - 5. (Knocks over first of intricate domino pattern) Sheldon: Don’t stop. Yes, keep going. Just like that.\\
194 - Almost there, almost there. Uh-huh-huh!\\
195 - Penny: Sheldon, you big weirdo, I want you to know that I love that you’re in my life.\\
196 - Sheldon: I love you, too.\\
197 - Scene: Later.\\
198 - Sheldon: Hello. Uh, is this the Bruce Miller who wrote the season finale of Alphas? Oh, smashing. Yeah, you already sound nicer than the last Bruce Miller who suggested I have sexual relations with myself. Now, down to business. Um, your show ended on a cliffhanger. Could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it? Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. I see. Well, that all stinks. No wonder you got cancelled. Bye.
\subsection {Episode 22: The Proton Resurgence}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Leonard: The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here, vertical Y coordinate here. When you’re happy with those, you press this button.\\
3 - Penny: Got it.\\
4 - Sheldon: Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Hey!\\
5 - Leonard: Nice shot.\\
6 - Penny: Eh, his giant head did most of the work.\\
7 - Sheldon: Very mature. You’re lucky I’m out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton.\\
8 - Leonard: You’re kidding. He’s still alive?\\
9 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
10 - Penny: Who’s Professor Proton?\\
11 - Leonard: He was the host of this great… Hey!\\
12 - Penny: Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.\\
13 - Sheldon: Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.\\
14 - Leonard: It was pretty cool.\\
15 - Penny: Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti.\\
16 - Sheldon: Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. He’s still available for parties and events. We should hire him.\\
17 - Leonard: Hire him to do what?\\
18 - Sheldon: Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.\\
19 - Leonard: It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didn’t I?\\
20 - Sheldon: Well, I’m e-mailing him right now.\\
21 - Leonard: Do you remember his old theme song?\\
22 - Sheldon: Of course I do.\\
23 - Together: Grab your goggles, put your lab coat on, here he comes, Professor Proton.\\
24 - Credits sequence.\\
25 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
26 - Raj: Hey, I just found out I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?\\
27 - Howard: Why don’t you put her in a kennel?\\
28 - Raj: Why don’t you put your mother in a home?\\
29 - Howard: To be honest, she’d do better in the kennel. I’ll talk to Bernie. I’m sure it’s fine.\\
30 - Raj: Thank you.\\
31 - Sheldon: It’s happening. Leonard, it’s happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.\\
32 - Leonard: You’re kidding.\\
33 - Howard: You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?\\
34 - Sheldon: And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I’d find a tactful way to do that.\\
35 - Howard: How’d you get him to come to your house?\\
36 - Sheldon: As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you can’t solve if you use your noggin.\\
37 - Leonard: And he wrote him a cheque.\\
38 - Sheldon: Yeah, that, too. Big cheque.\\
39 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
40 - Raj: Uncle Howard. Cinnamon’s here for her sleepover party.\\
41 - Howard: You know if you had a stroke, she’d eat you, right?\\
42 - Raj: And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.\\
43 - Howard: Okay, so what do I need to know to take care of her?\\
44 - Raj: It’s very simple. For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin, but not both. We’re watching our weight. Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like.\\
45 - Howard: Classy dog.\\
46 - Raj: Yes. Also, don’t forget to close the toilet or she’ll drink out of it.\\
47 - Howatd: I feel for ya. I’ve got a psychotic mommy, too.\\
48 - Scene: Leonard’s bedroom.\\
49 - Sheldon (off): Leonard, are you in bed?\\
50 - Leonard: Yes.\\
51 - Sheldon (off): Me, too.\\
52 - Leonard: Great.\\
53 - Sheldon (off): I can’t sleep.\\
54 - Leonard: Well, I can, so shut up.\\
55 - Sheldon (off): Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?\\
56 - Leonard: Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you’re gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.\\
57 - Sheldon (off): I’m thinking of wearing a tuxedo.\\
58 - Leonard: That’s not ridiculous. Good night.\\
59 - Sheldon (off): Do you have cufflinks?\\
60 - Leonard: No.\\
61 - Sheldon (off): Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three o’clock in the morning?\\
62 - Leonard: Okay, good night.\\
63 - Sheldon (off): Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof… Ow! Leonard?\\
64 - Leonard: What?\\
65 - Sheldon (off): I still can’t sleep.\\
66 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
67 - Howard: She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?\\
68 - Bernadette: Yeah, you two were so cute playing together.\\
69 - Howard: It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.\\
70 - Bernadette: And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn’t wear out her tiny legs.\\
71 - Howard: Yeah, that’s what I was doing.\\
72 - Bernadette: You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family.\\
73 - Howard: Really?\\
74 - Bernadette: Yeah. I never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, I felt like maybe someday we could do it.\\
75 - Howard: Of course we can. Especially if our baby’s as calm and quiet as little Cinna… Son of a bitch, she’s gone.\\
76 - Bernadette: Where’d she go?\\
77 - Howard: I don’t know, she didn’t leave a note.\\
78 - Bernadette: Well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller.\\
79 - Howard: No, I wasn’t. You were.\\
80 - Bernadette: No, I wasn’t.\\
81 - Howard: Yes, you were!.\\
82 - Bernadette: Yeah, well, you throw like a girl.\\
83 - Scene: The apartment. \\
84 - Sheldon: I’m getting worried.\\
85 - Penny: Relax, Sheldon, he’s only a few minutes late.\\
86 - Sheldon: Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four o’clock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case we’d join him in progress. (Phone rings) It’s him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye.\\
87 - Leonard: Where is he?\\
88 - Sheldon: The third floor landing. The poor old guy’s been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It’s really you.\\
89 - (On the third floor landing)\\
90 - Leonard: Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We should’ve told you about the broken elevator.\\
91 - Arthur: I agree.\\
92 - Sheldon: Professor Proton, it’s an honour to meet you.\\
93 - Arthur: Just, just call me Arthur.\\
94 - Sheldon: Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we’re friends.\\
95 - Arthur: No. A friend would’ve, would’ve told me about the elevator.\\
96 - Sheldon: Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it’s going to ruin my eyes.\\
97 - Arthur: Is, uh, is he dangerous?\\
98 - Leonard: Actually, he’s a genius.\\
99 - Sheldon: I am.\\
100 - Arthur: That doesn’t answer my question.\\
101 - Leonard: Mr. Jeffries, I’m, I’m Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny.\\
102 - Arthur: Hi.\\
103 - Penny: Hello.\\
104 - Arthur: Well, I hope I haven’t, uh, kept the kids waiting too long for, for the show.\\
105 - Sheldon: Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the show’s for me. Come on. I’ll race ya, Arthur.\\
106 - Arthur: Is the, is the blonde girl really your, your girlfriend?\\
107 - Leonard: Yes, sir.\\
108 - Arthur: You’re the genius.\\
109 - (Back in the Apartment)\\
110 - Penny: So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?\\
111 - Arthur: It, it’s hard to say. I’m, I’m still trying to figure out what, what th, what this is.\\
112 - Leonard: We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.\\
113 - Arthur: Well, there, there really isn’t too much to tell. After the TV show was, was cancelled, nobody in the scientific world would, uh, would take me seriously. So I was forced to do these, uh, children’s parties to, to make a living.\\
114 - Leonard: That’s too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding.\\
115 - Arthur: You, you get bit a lot. Let me see if, if I have this straight. You, you two are, are physicists, and you, and you want me to do a children’s science show?\\
116 - Sheldon: Yes. And if there’s time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.\\
117 - Arthur: You know, I’m a real scientist. I, I have a PhD from Cornell University.\\
118 - Sheldon: Yeah, that’s great. Did you bring your puppet?\\
119 - Arthur: No, no. I, I hate that puppet.\\
120 - Sheldon: Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It’s nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!\\
121 - Arthur: I’m, I’m awake, right? Th, this is happening?\\
122 - Scene: Bernadette’s car.\\
123 - Bernadette: Cinnamon!\\
124 - Howard: Cinnamon!\\
125 - Bernadette: You know, maybe she doesn’t recognize her name because of Raj’s accent.\\
126 - Howard: Good thinking. (In a bad Indian accent) Cinnamon, come to Daddy.\\
127 - Bernadette (likewise): Cinnamon. Where are you, my little lamb chop?\\
128 - Howard: Nice.\\
129 - Bernadette: Thanks.\\
130 - Howard: When this all blows over, remember that voice. It’s kind of a turn-on.\\
131 - Bernadette: It turns you on when I sound like Raj?\\
132 - Howard: Cinnamon!\\
133 - Scene: The apartment. \\
134 - Arthur: Okay, as, as I put the egg on top, and, and the flame goes out and, and, and the air pressure decreases in, in the flask, what do you think will happen?\\
135 - Penny: I think I know.\\
136 - Sheldon: It’s gonna get sucked in. It’s going to get sucked in.\\
137 - Penny: Okay, I didn’t know.\\
138 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
139 - Penny: See, I’m not a scientist like them.\\
140 - Arthur: I, I figured that out.\\
141 - Sheldon: Potato clock. Do potato clock.\\
142 - Penny: What’s that?\\
143 - Arthur: I, I power a clock with a, with a potato.\\
144 - Penny: Shut up. You can do that? I mean, wouldn’t that solve the world’s energy crisis?\\
145 - Arthur: No. Look, guys, keep your money. I, I think, uh, I, I think I’m done.\\
146 - Sheldon: What, well what’s wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.\\
147 - Arthur: No, she, she’s the only reason I’ve, I’ve stayed this long.\\
148 - Leonard: Then what is it?\\
149 - Arthur: I don’t know. I think I’m just, I, I just, I just don’t want to be Professor Proton any more.\\
150 - Sheldon: Well, how can you say that? Professor Proton’s the best.\\
151 - Arthur: What, what has it ever gotten me? I mean, I’m, I’m an 83-year-old man who has potatoes in, in his suitcase. Other scientists think, think I’m a joke. And the, the puppeteer who did, who did Gino, well, he also did my wife.\\
152 - Sheldon: Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something. :14:11,446\\
153 - Penny: I’m sorry to hear about your troubles.\\
154 - Arthur: Uh, thanks.\\
155 - Penny: But if you don’t mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?\\
156 - Arthur: What do you two talk about?\\
157 - Sheldon: I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?\\
158 - Arthur: I’ll, I’ll give you a hint. I have a bracelet with my own address on it.\\
159 - Sheldon: Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn’t have any friends growing up.\\
160 - Arthur: No, I, I get that.\\
161 - Sheldon: But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o’clock, you’d come to my house on Channel 68, and we’d do science together. If it hadn’t been for you, well, who knows what would’ve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could’ve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.\\
162 - Leonard: I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.\\
163 - Sheldon: Yeah, it’s true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.\\
164 - Arthur: Well, thank, thank you, guys. That, that, that means a lot.\\
165 - Leonard: It’s important you know how much you mean to us.\\
166 - Arthur: Uh-oh.\\
167 - Penny: Arthur, are you okay?\\
168 - Arthur: I’m having a problem with my pacemaker.\\
169 - Leonard: I’ll, I’ll call for help.\\
170 - Penny: Any chance we could plug it into the potato?\\
171 - Arthur: No.\\
172 - Scene: The telescope lab. Raj’s phone rings.\\
173 - Raj: Hello? What do you mean, you found my dog? She’s with my friends. Is she okay? Oh, thank you. Uh, just text me your address, I’m on my way. Oh, and if she’s hungry, go ahead and feed her. But do not give her anything starchy. She’s having risotto for dinner.\\
174 - Scene: The apartment.\\
175 - Paramedic: Your vitals are stable, but let’s take you in for some tests just to be safe.\\
176 - Leonard: You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?\\
177 - Sheldon: I’ll do it.\\
178 - Arthur: He’s not a relative, he’s not allowed, right?\\
179 - Paramedic: No, that’s not a rule. He can go.\\
180 - Sheldon: Oh, yeah.\\
181 - Arthur: I can’t catch a break today.\\
182 - Penny: We’ll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.\\
183 - Leonard: I’m sorry things turned out this way.\\
184 - Arthur: Well, at, at this point, I’m just glad someone’s carrying me down the stairs.\\
185 - Sheldon: Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this’ll be the best day ever.\\
186 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
187 - Bernadette: Can’t believe we lost her. What was I thinking? I’d be a terrible mom.\\
188 - Howard: Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first one’s always a throwaway. How’s this look?\\
189 - Bernadette: It’s fine. Where’d you get that picture of her?\\
190 - Howard: It’s not her. I just googled foo-foo little dogs. (Skype tone) It’s Raj. Stay quiet. Hey, bad timing. Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk.\\
191 - Raj: Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liars’ Lane?\\
192 - Howard: What?\\
193 - Raj: A lane frequented by liars. Like you, you big liar.\\
194 - Howard: You have her?\\
195 - Bernadette: Oh, thank God she’s okay.\\
196 - Raj: Well, I trusted you, and you let me down. The poor thing’s been shaking for hours.\\
197 - Howard: I’m really sorry.\\
198 - Bernadette: Hang on, you’ve had her for hours?\\
199 - Raj: Yes. I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry.\\
200 - Bernadette: So you knew she was okay, and you couldn’t pick up the phone to tell us?\\
201 - Raj: Well, I, I thought about…\\
202 - Bernadette: Don’t well me, mister. We’ve been worried sick. She could have been dead for all we knew. You should be ashamed of yourself.\\
203 - Raj: Sorry. I, I just…\\
204 - Bernadette: Sorry’s not good enough. Maybe you need to take some time and think about what you’ve done.\\
205 - Howard: Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom.\\
206 - Scene: A hospital room.\\
207 - Sheldon: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.\\
208 - Arthur: Thank you, Sheldon. That, that was very nice.\\
209 - Sheldon: Want me to sing it again?\\
210 - Arthur: No. The fourth, the fourth time was, was the charm.\\
211 - Sheldon: There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?\\
212 - Arthur: No. No, thank you. But I, I do, I do have a favour to, to ask.\\
213 - Sheldon: Name it.\\
214 - Arthur: Well, I’m, I’m booked to do a children’s party tomorrow, and, um, frankly I, you know, I, I don’t feel up to it.\\
215 - Sheldon: Oh, you’re not. You look awful.\\
216 - Arthur: Thank you. Anyway, uh, I mean, you know my act better than anybody. I was, I was hoping that maybe, you know, maybe you’d fill in for me.\\
217 - Sheldon: Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?\\
218 - Arthur: Yeah.\\
219 - Sheldon: Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.\\
220 - Arthur: Or a Korean family in Alhambra.\\
221 - Sheldon: But they’ll know I’m not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?\\
222 - Arthur: Sounds great.\\
223 - Sheldon: So, in a way it’s like I’m your son.\\
224 - Arthur: What, Whatever.\\
225 - Sheldon: Father.\\
226 - Arthur: Sure, what the hell.

1 - Scene: A taxi\\
2 - Bernadette: Burbank Airport, please.\\
3 - Penny: Vegas, here we come.\\
4 - Bernadette: No husbands, no boyfriends, no rules.\\
5 - Amy: No rules? We’re not gonna get drunk and have a six-way with the Blue Man Group, are we?\\
6 - Penny: No.\\
7 - Amy: So there are some rules.\\
8 - Bernadette: Fine. No husbands, no boyfriends, some rules.\\
9 - Amy: Thank you. Vegas!\\
10 - Scene: The apartment. \\
11 - Howard: The ladies are away, the boys will play.\\
12 - Raj: Anything can happen.\\
13 - Leonard: It’s gonna get crazy.\\
14 - Sheldon: Dungeons & Dragons.\\
15 - Scene: The taxi. \\
16 - Penny: I got a brand-new bikini, so drinks at the pool are on these.\\
17 - Bernadette: I got a sexy new tube top that says come hither, and a can of pepper spray that says close enough, Jack.\\
18 - Amy: I got some old underwear I’m gonna throw on stage at the Garth Brooks concert.\\
19 - Penny: I’m sorry, why old?\\
20 - Amy: ‘Cause last time I saw him, I threw new ones and it got me nothing.\\
21 - Scene: The apartment. \\
22 - Sheldon: I’ve got a brand-new seven piece set of polyhedral dice. Hello, new dice smell.\\
23 - Leonard: I’ve got my helm of lordly might, my boots of speed, and if things get too exciting, my inhaler of asthma.\\
24 - Raj: I got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior who will lay waste to all who stand before him. And I had a sensible salad for lunch, so I can eat all the pizza I want.\\
25 - Howard: Come on, are we gonna sit around chatting like a bunch of teenage girls, or are we gonna play D&D like a bunch of teenage boys who are never gonna have s*x with those teenage girls?\\
26 - Scene: The taxi. \\
27 - Girls: Vegas! Vegas! Vegas!\\
28 - Scene: The apartment.\\
29 - Boys: The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko! The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko! The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko!\\
30 - Credits sequence. \\
31 - Scene: The apartment.\\
32 - Raj: I’m actually glad Lucy had to work tonight. Saved me the awkward conversation about how I was gonna be hanging with my bros.\\
33 - Howard: Isn’t every conversation you two have awkward?\\
34 - Raj: Painfully so. We have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes, you can just hang up. So into her.\\
35 - Howard: Ready whenever you guys are.\\
36 - Sheldon: Yeah, yeah, we’ll be right there. Leonard?\\
37 - Leonard: Yeah?\\
38 - Sheldon: I’m not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you.\\
39 - Leonard: Oh, that’s nice. But relax, sometimes change is good. Uh, you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock, but you wound up liking him.\\
40 - Sheldon: Oh, please. Every time the topic of change comes up, you throw Zachary Quinto in my face. I’m upset the mailman has a new haircut, Zachary Quinto. I’m upset that daylight saving time started, Zachary Quinto. I’m upset daylight saving time ended, Zachary Quinto. I’m saying this for the last time, Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. So stop using him against me.\\
41 - Howard: Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in an overgrown old forest. Before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage. He says, (Nicolas Cage voice) Travel with caution. These woods are home to the bones of many a fallen hero.\\
42 - Leonard: See, Howard’s just as good a dungeon master as I am.\\
43 - Sheldon: As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes.\\
44 - Raj: Hey, come on, guys, focus. Um, uh, oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree, we thank you for your warning, but we are brave warriors, and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal. (Text sound) Oh, Lucy’s free after all. See ya.\\
45 - Leonard: Hey, hey, hey, you can’t leave. We just started.\\
46 - Raj: You’re right, I should finish the game. I take my plus-one long sword, stab myself in the face with it. I’m dead, I’ve got a date with a girl. Bye.\\
47 - Howard: We’ll be fine, watch. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Koothrappali’s bloody corpse, and says, (Raj voice) don’t worry, buddies, ghost Raj will help guide you through the forest. (Nicolas Cage voice) Well, I’m just a tree, but if I were you, I’d listen to your ghost friend.\\
48 - Sheldon: Go on, give him your lunch money.\\
49 - Scene: A restaurant\\
50 - Raj: I’m very happy you were able to hang out tonight.\\
51 - Lucy: Me, too.\\
52 - Raj: Not that it’s up to you to make me happy. Uh, well, unless you find neediness sexy. In which case, you’re about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet.\\
53 - Lucy: Can I tell you something? I was so nervous about seeing you, before I left my apartment, I put roll-on antiperspirant all over my body.\\
54 - Raj: Really?\\
55 - Lucy: Yeah. If sweat starts squirting out the top of my head, you’ll know why.\\
56 - Raj: I, uh, I’m sorry to put you through that.\\
57 - Lucy: Oh, it’s okay. I’ve been trying to force myself to do things that make me scared.\\
58 - Raj: What else have you been thinking about doing?\\
59 - Lucy: Well, let’s see. I’d love to be able to tell the lady who cuts my hair that I don’t like bangs.\\
60 - Raj: I like your bangs.\\
61 - Lucy: Oh, thanks, I like ‘em, too.\\
62 - Raj: What else?\\
63 - Lucy: Mmm, it’s kind of a tie between sending food back in a restaurant and saying no to those kids who sell magazines door-to-door.\\
64 - Raj: Mm, yeah. Those are both toughies.\\
65 - Lucy: I know. I have a two-year subscription to Guns & Ammo.53\\
66 - Scene: The apartment.\\
67 - Leonard: I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.\\
68 - Howard: Uh, it does. (Creaking sound)\\
69 - Sheldon: He does sound effects, too!\\
70 - Leonard: Hey, I always did sound effects. A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon. (Clicking sounds) Uh, uh, they attack a nearby unicorn. (Strange howl)\\
71 - Sheldon: Okay, well, I have a sound effect for those sound effects. (Blows raspberry)\\
72 - Penny: Guess who?\\
73 - Howard: What are you doing back?\\
74 - Bernadette: That’s an excellent question. Amy?\\
75 - Amy: Uh, well, when we were going through security, I got pulled out of line for a pat-down. The, uh, TSA agent got a little handsy. I may have broken her nose with my elbow.\\
76 - Bernadette: Long story short, she’s on the No Fly List and we might have been followed here by a drone.\\
77 - Amy: I’m sorry. I feel like such an idiot.\\
78 - Penny: Oh, it’s not so bad. You lost money, you’re filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger. I mean, that’s Vegas, you nailed it.\\
79 - Amy: You guys enjoy your evening. I’m gonna go before I ruin anybody else’s weekend.\\
80 - Sheldon: Ah, that’s my girl.\\
81 - Leonard: No, no, no, Amy, wait. I know it’s not the night you had in mind, but why don’t you guys stay and play with us? It’ll be fun.\\
82 - Sheldon: It would? Fun? Okay, three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play D&D? Do you have a drug problem?\\
83 - Leonard: What’s the big deal? Raj bailed, so we could use some extra players.\\
84 - Sheldon: Well, I’ve just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before.\\
85 - Penny: Oh, don’t worry, sweetie. No one has.\\
86 - Leonard: So, what do you say?\\
87 - Sheldon: I’ll leave it up to the dungeon master.\\
88 - Howard: A satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino rises from the forest floor and says, (Al Pacino voice) You’re playing D&D. You’re playing D&D. This whole apartment is playing D&D.\\
89 - Scene: Later, the same.\\
90 - Penny: Okay, who wants a drink?\\
91 - Sheldon: Yeah, we, now, Penny, we don’t consume alcohol during Dungeons & Dragons. It impairs our judgment.\\
92 - Penny: Oh, this isn’t alcohol. It’s a magic potion that makes me like you.\\
93 - Leonard: Double potion, please.\\
94 - Howard: Okay, here we go. You find yourselves face-to-face with two hulking ogres. What are you doing in our dungeon? You shall die!\\
95 - Sheldon: Okay, literal goose bumps. Look.\\
96 - Howard: What do you do?\\
97 - Leonard: I draw my broadsword.\\
98 - Sheldon: I ready my quarter-staff.\\
99 - Penny: I drink my potion.\\
100 - Bernadette: I say we attack the big one.\\
101 - Penny: You know what? Give me the dice, I want to roll.\\
102 - Howard: The dungeon master’s supposed to roll.\\
103 - Penny: Yeah, well I’m supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet. Now give it. All right, what do I need?\\
104 - Howard: Uh, fifteen or higher.\\
105 - Penny: Fifteen’s the point, the point is fifteen. Give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out. Sixteen! Yes! Oh, please tell me we’re playing for money.\\
106 - Sheldon: Oh, even better than money. You gained experience points.\\
107 - Penny: More potion, please.\\
108 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
109 - Scene: The restaurant.\\
110 - Raj: How are your crab cakes?\\
111 - Lucy: Kind of funky.\\
112 - Raj: That’s great.\\
113 - Lucy: It is? Does funky mean something different in India?\\
114 - Raj: No, no. Uh, you’ve always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant, here’s your chance.\\
115 - Lucy: Mmm, it’s okay. I just won’t eat ‘em.\\
116 - Raj: Don’t be ridiculous. Waiter?\\
117 - Waiter: Everything all right?\\
118 - Lucy: Uh, yeah. Everything all right with you?\\
119 - Waiter: Yes.\\
120 - Lucy: ‘Kay, thanks, bye.\\
121 - Raj: Hold on. Isn’t there something else you wanted to tell him?\\
122 - Lucy: N-No, it, it’s fine. Uh, He’s from a different country, he doesn’t understand our ways.\\
123 - Raj: Don’t be silly. Just tell him.\\
124 - Lucy: I have to go to the bathroom. And it’s not because the crab cakes are funky.\\
125 - Waiter: So you’re okay here?\\
126 - Raj: Uh, yeah, sorry. She’s just a little shy. The first time we met, she was so nervous, she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me.\\
127 - Scene: Lucy climbs out of bathroom window to find a locked gate.\\
128 - Lucy: Uh-oh. (Dials phone) Hey, Raj. Funny story.\\
129 - Scene: The apartment.\\
130 - Bernadette: Come on, mama wants a pair of dead ogres.\\
131 - Howard: Seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. The-the other ogre says, you killed my brother, now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined.\\
132 - Sheldon: That is amazing. He made me care about the ogre.\\
133 - Leonard: All right, Amy, there’s one ogre left. Take him out.\\
134 - Amy: Okay.\\
135 - Penny: Pretend he’s that TSA agent. Come on.\\
136 - Amy: Nineteen. Yes, this is turning out to be even better than Vegas.\\
137 - Penny: No, it’s not.\\
138 - Scene: An alley behind the restaurant.\\
139 - Raj: Lucy?\\
140 - Lucy: Hey. Long time no see.\\
141 - Raj: You don’t know me very well, but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company, it chips away at my masculinity.\\
142 - Lucy: I’m sorry.\\
143 - Raj: Why would you leave like that?\\
144 - Lucy: You were pushing me. I clearly didn’t want to send my food back, and you tried to make me do it anyway.\\
145 - Raj: Okay, if I upset you, then why didn’t you just say something?\\
146 - Lucy: Well, how can I tell you I’m upset if I can’t tell the woman at Supercuts that my forehead’s my best feature? It’s scary.\\
147 - Raj: Yeah, well, I like you a lot, and that’s scary for me. Mostly because you’re a proven flight risk.\\
148 - Lucy: How could you like me a lot?\\
149 - Raj: Well, uh, for one thing, you have bigger emotional problems than I do, and I find that very attractive in a woman. I, I don’t know. I just, I think you’re wonderful.\\
150 - Lucy: I’m sweating out of my head.\\
151 - Scene: The apartment. \\
152 - Howard: The dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the volcano.\\
153 - Sheldon: Yay!\\
154 - Howard: But wait., he’s not dead. He crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack.\\
155 - Sheldon: Yeah, uh, wait. Doesn’t he say something first? You know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?\\
156 - Howard: Fine. (Christopher Walken voice) You’d think, after all these years, I’d know not to fly over volcanoes. I’m a freaking idiot.\\
157 - Sheldon: The dragon’s Christopher Walken. That’s perfect.\\
158 - Leonard: All right, Amy, it’s your turn. We need one more hit. Finish him off.\\
159 - Amy: Here we go. Fifteen?\\
160 - Howard: It’s a hit. The dragon collapses to the ground.\\
161 - Sheldon: Wait. Wait. And says?\\
162 - Howard: Mother? Is that you? Your little boy is coming home.\\
163 - Sheldon: Oh, I don’t know about you guys, but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight.\\
164 - Bernadette: This may be the potion talking, but you are one fine-ass dungeon master.\\
165 - Howard: Oh, yeah? Well, when we get home, I’m gonna take you on a whole different adventure.\\
166 - Sheldon: Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.\\
167 - Amy: Sheldon, they’re talking about s*x.\\
168 - Sheldon: Oh, then I’m out.\\
169 - Penny: Ooh, I have an idea. Since it’s not happening any time soon, why don’t your character and your character do it in the game?\\
170 - Bernadette: Ooh! Come on, back me up here.\\
171 - Howard: Oh.\\
172 - Together: Ooh!\\
173 - Bernadette: Okay, I cast a love spell on Sheldon and Amy.\\
174 - Leonard: Ooh! Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that.\\
175 - Howard: The love spell takes effect. When Sheldon looks at Amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc he’s ever seen, and he’s overcome with a desire to rip her armour off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts. When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks, well, just like Sheldon, ’cause apparently she’s into that. What do you do?\\
176 - Amy: I don’t like this.\\
177 - Sheldon: You see what happens when you let girls play D&D?\\
178 - Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom. \\
179 - Sheldon (off): (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.\\
180 - Amy: What?\\
181 - Sheldon: I’ve never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride.\\
182 - Amy: You don’t have to come in here and cheer me up.\\
183 - Sheldon: Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that? Because they sure think otherwise.\\
184 - Amy: I’ll tell you what they think. They think our relationship is a joke.\\
185 - Sheldon: Well, I don’t think our relationship is a joke. I think “a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?’, that’s a joke. It’s a good one, too, because a horse has a long face.\\
186 - Amy: Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?\\
187 - Sheldon: Oh, my. That’s an uncomfortable topic. Amy, before I met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone.\\
188 - Amy: And now?\\
189 - Sheldon: And now what?\\
190 - Amy: Do you have any interest now?\\
191 - Sheldon: I have not ruled it out.\\
192 - Amy: Wow. Talk dirty to me.\\
193 - Sheldon: I know it doesn’t seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate.\\
194 - Amy: I guess I know that. It’s just, part of me wants more.\\
195 - Sheldon: More? I mean, look at us. It’s only been three years, here we are in bed together.\\
196 - Amy: Come on. Let’s go back out there.\\
197 - Sheldon: Well, no. Hold on. My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. We wouldn’t really be playing the game right if we didn’t see that through.\\
198 - Amy: Okay.\\
199 - Sheldon: I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. While the others pillage the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armour. (Rolls dice) It comes off.\\
200 - Amy: Oh.\\
201 - Sheldon: What do you do?\\
202 - Amy: I kiss you on the lips.\\
203 - Sheldon: I kiss you back on the (Rolls dice) lips as well. Your turn.\\
204 - Amy: I remove your armour. What do you do?\\
205 - Sheldon: I erotically caress your (Rolls dice) nose.\\
206 - Amy: Keep rolling.\\
207 - Scene: Outside Sheldon’s bedroom.\\
208 - Leonard: Hey, you guys have been in there for a while. You doing okay?\\
209 - Sheldon (off): We’re fine, thank you.\\
210 - Penny: Okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about…\\
211 - Amy: Go away! Sheldon is nibbling on my (sound of dice) 14! Yes!
\subsection {Episode 24: The Bon Voyage Reaction}
1 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
2 - Raj: So, anyway, last night on video chat, I spent, like, twenty minutes just staring into Lucy’s eyes.\\
3 - Leonard: Oh, that sounds romantic.\\
4 - Raj: It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three datesof all time.\\
5 - Leonard: So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?\\
6 - Raj: I’d love that, but she’s not really comfortable around people.\\
7 - Sheldon: Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek.\\
8 - Leonard: How’s that been working for you?\\
9 - Sheldon: Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt.\\
10 - Howard: Leonard, I may have gotten you a job.\\
11 - Leonard: I have a job.\\
12 - Sheldon: Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim.\\
13 - Howard: No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking’s team is sending an expedition to the North Sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes. One of their experimental physicists dropped out, and I recommended you.\\
14 - Leonard: Well, do you really think I have a shot?\\
15 - Howard: Yeah, I’ve worked with Hawking. I talked you up. He knows your research. I think this could happen.\\
16 - Leonard: He knows, wow.\\
17 - Sheldon: Well, now, but do you think that’s a good idea? Uh, you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?\\
18 - Raj: Hey, don’t discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity.\\
19 - Sheldon: No one asked you, Uhura.\\
20 - Scene: Leonard’s car.\\
21 - Sheldon: Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?\\
22 - Leonard: What do you think?\\
23 - Sheldon: Great. I’ve been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?\\
24 - Leonard: Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.\\
25 - Sheldon: Well, that’s the thing about factoids, they’re interesting.\\
26 - Leonard: I know what you’re doing. You don’t want me going on this research trip because you’re afraid to be alone.\\
27 - Sheldon: I’m not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea, it would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning.\\
28 - Leonard: Sheldon.\\
29 - Sheldon: Fine, no more drowning talk. I’ll change the subject. Oh. Who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?\\
30 - Leonard: Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say that’s going to stop me.\\
31 - Sheldon: Very well. Things between you and Penny have never been better. I hope four months apart doesn’t change anything. I should have opened with that, huh?\\
32 - Credits sequence.\\
33 - Scene: Raj’s apartment. Lucy is looking through Raj’s telescope.\\
34 - Raj: If you look carefully at Venus, you should be able to see the International Space Station pass by.\\
35 - Lucy: Wow. Your friend was actually up there?\\
36 - Raj: Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt\\
37 - Lucy: Did he take the T-shirt to space?\\
38 - Raj: Nope. It’s exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of friends, they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?\\
39 - Lucy: I don’t know. How many are there?\\
40 - Raj: Let’s see. Six. That’s pretty cool, I have six friends. Kind of like Sinatra.\\
41 - Lucy: Six strangers? That’s a lot of pressure. Staring at me, asking me personal questions. Like, what do you do? Where are you from? Why did you lock yourself in the bathroom?\\
42 - Raj: Okay, how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?\\
43 - Lucy: Will you be there?\\
44 - Raj: Of course.\\
45 - Lucy: Well, that’s two. Three if you count me. Oh, this is getting out of hand.\\
46 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. \\
47 - Penny: So, then, during my afternoon shift, I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.\\
48 - Leonard: Oh, that’s awful.\\
49 - Penny: Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.\\
50 - Leonard: So, listen, do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?\\
51 - Penny: I thought I said that to you.\\
52 - Leonard: Anyway, Stephen Hawking’s team is looking into that, and I’ve been invited to join them.\\
53 - Penny: Wow, Hawking. Good for you.\\
54 - Leonard: Well, it is. Just, you know, I’d be gone for a while.\\
55 - Penny: Well, how long?\\
56 - Leonard: Three, four months.\\
57 - Penny: Whoa. When would you leave?\\
58 - Leonard: Couple of weeks.\\
59 - Penny: Wow. Oh, okay, well, I’ll just come visit you.\\
60 - Leonard: That’s the thing, you can’t. I’ll be on a ship in the North Sea.\\
61 - Penny: On a ship? Aren’t they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?\\
62 - Leonard: Uh, he’s not gonna be there. He’s just sending a team to research his theory.\\
63 - Penny: Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months.\\
64 - Leonard: Yeah. And I’m a little worried because things between us have been so great, and I’d hate to do anything that screws that up.\\
65 - Penny: Oh, sweetie, if you’re gonna screw things up, it’s gonna be while you’re here, not while you’re away. No. I mean, look, you have to go. It sounds like an amazing opportunity. And I’m just basing that on how much I didn’t understand what you said about it.\\
66 - Leonard: Okay. I’ll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.\\
67 - Penny: Okay. Good.\\
68 - Leonard: I do have to ask you one favour.\\
69 - Penny: Sure.\\
70 - Leonard: Sheldon’s nervous about me leaving. Just keep an eye on him while I’m gone.\\
71 - Penny: Oh, I don’t know. Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?\\
72 - Leonard: Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one.\\
73 - Scene: The apartment. \\
74 - Leonard: Really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party.\\
75 - Howard: Are you kidding me? How often can you say bon voyage to somebody when they’re actually going on a voyage?\\
76 - Amy: Hello, Rajesh.\\
77 - Howard (in Raj accent): Hello, Amy. Nice to see you. What can I say? It’s funnier with the accent.\\
78 - Leonard: There’s beer in the fridge. Anyway, you guys really don’t need to make a big deal.\\
79 - Sheldon: Leonard, you’re being selfish. We need to give you a proper send-off so we’ll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face.\\
80 - Penny: Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.\\
81 - Bernadette: You know, one of the things that helped me get through Howard being in space for so long was getting married before he left.\\
82 - Penny: Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.\\
83 - Raj: Okay. I have a request to make.\\
84 - Amy: And now he can talk. I want to cut open your brain and see what the heck’s going on in there.\\
85 - Raj: The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil. Anyway, I, I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all, and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one.\\
86 - Sheldon: Oh, gee, I don’t know. My schedule’s a little busy.\\
87 - Raj: Actually, I was thinking Leonard.\\
88 - Leonard: Oh. Thank you, Raj. I’d be honoured.\\
89 - Howard: What the hell? I thought I was your best friend.\\
90 - Raj: You are, but you’ve got kind of a big personality, with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger.\\
91 - Penny: You know, maybe she’d be more comfortable meeting a girl first.\\
92 - Raj: Good idea. Bernadette?\\
93 - Penny: What the hell?\\
94 - Raj: Well, you’re very pretty. That could be intimidating to another woman.\\
95 - Penny: Oh, yeah.\\
96 - Bernadette: Hey, you don’t think I’m pretty enough to scare your girlfriend?\\
97 - Howard: Calm down, Bernie. You’re very scary.\\
98 - Amy: It should be me.\\
99 - Raj: Why? So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?\\
100 - Amy: A, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. And B, more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know how frightening that can be. But you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like I was family.\\
101 - Sheldon: Fine, I’ll do it.\\
102 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
103 - Amy: So, after I started dating Sheldon, I met Leonard, and then everybody else, and they’ve all been so wonderful to me.\\
104 - Lucy: That’s really nice to hear.\\
105 - Amy: Maybe next week, we could all get together.\\
106 - Raj: Oh, Lucy, you don’t have to answer that. Don’t put her on the spot. She hates that. Am I right? Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot. Go ahead, tell her.\\
107 - Amy: Ignore him. He’s a little nervous ’cause he doesn’t think I understand the severity of your social anxiety.\\
108 - Raj: What the? Are you crazy? You can’t talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious!\\
109 - Amy: Excuse me, but I’m a neurobiologist. I think I’m a little more qualified than you to understand what’s not working in your girlfriend’s brain!\\
110 - Raj: Don’t call her my girlfriend. We haven’t discussed whether or not we’re girlfriend or boyfriend yet. Now that it’s out there, are you my girlfriend? By the way, if you say no, I’ll never be happy again. Not to put you on the spot.\\
111 - Lucy: I think I have to go to the bathroom.\\
112 - Raj: We might as well go ahead and eat. She’s not coming back anytime soon.\\
113 - Scene: A store.\\
114 - Sheldon: This is ridiculous, we’re shopping for a party and this store doesn’t even have a party section.\\
115 - Penny: Yeah, it does, and here we are.\\
116 - Sheldon: You know, I have to say, Penny, I don’t understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this.\\
117 - Penny: Well, I’m his girlfriend, of course I’m gonna support him.\\
118 - Sheldon: Yeah, well, you’re his girlfriend for now. You know, maybe you’re not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other’s arms and britches.\\
119 - Penny: Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay? He gets to work with Stephen Hawking. Who, by the way, will not be on the boat. I checked it out.\\
120 - Sheldon: It’s not that big of an opportunity. And even if Hawking’s theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean, me? I’m interested in the big questions.\\
121 - Penny: Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.\\
122 - Sheldon: I’m not jealous. I’m just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me.\\
123 - Penny: Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay? But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn’t take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasn’t very good at her job.\\
124 - Sheldon: It was you.\\
125 - Penny: It wasn’t me. But she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. She got it. Look, I was so jealous. But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair…\\
126 - Sheldon: You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.\\
127 - Penny: I, looked her in the eye, smiled and said, I’m happy for you. Because that’s what friends do.\\
128 - Sheldon: They lie so they don’t look petty.\\
129 - Penny: Yeah.\\
130 - Sheldon: How?\\
131 - Penny: Like this. I am so happy for you.\\
132 - Sheldon: Wow. No wonder you didn’t get that toothpaste commercial.\\
133 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
134 - Raj (on skype): Hey.\\
135 - Lucy: Hi.\\
136 - Raj: I want to apologize for Amy last night. She was completely out of line. Are you, are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again?\\
137 - Lucy: Amy wasn’t the problem.\\
138 - Raj: Okay. I know. It was me. I, I pushed too hard. I’m sorry.\\
139 - Lucy: Thank you.\\
140 - Raj: You know, I, I’ve been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense, so Friday night, my friends are having a party.\\
141 - Lucy: A party?\\
142 - Raj: A little one. It’s, it’s a farewell for Leonard, so all the attention will be on him. If you wear something brown and sit on the couch, they won’t even know you’re there.\\
143 - Lucy: I’m not sure.\\
144 - Raj: Oh, please?\\
145 - Lucy: Raj.\\
146 - Raj: Come on. Don’t make me beg. And I’m from India, so I know how to do it.\\
147 - Lucy: Okay.\\
148 - Raj: Yeah, thank you! This means a lot to me. My friends are like my family. Unless you don’t like them, in which case, they’re dead to me.\\
149 - Scene: The apartment. \\
150 - Bernadette: So, have you ever spent a long time on a boat before?\\
151 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
152 - Bernadette: Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?\\
153 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
154 - Howard: I’m proud of you, Leonard. Working out on the North Sea for months, that’s really something.\\
155 - Leonard: I know. As far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime.\\
156 - Howard: Maybe your lifetime. I went to space.\\
157 - Leonard: It’s not a competition.\\
158 - Howard: You’re right, you’re right. I’m really proud of you, and I’m gonna miss you when you’re gone. And space beats water.\\
159 - Amy: Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming.\\
160 - Raj: She is. She’s just running a little late. You know how it is, girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup. She’ll be here. Just give it a rest, okay?\\
161 - Sheldon: Um, can I have your attention, everyone? (Clinks glass) That’s, uh, B-flat, for those who don’t have perfect pitch. I would like to propose a toast to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and I couldn’t be happier for him.\\
162 - Leonard: Thank you, Sheldon. That must’ve been very hard for you to say.\\
163 - Sheldon: Well, I mean it. I’m really happy for you. And that’s how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.\\
164 - Howard: Cheers.\\
165 - Penny: Cheers.\\
166 - Howard: It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard.\\
167 - Sheldon: Thank you.\\
168 - Howard: It must’ve killed you when I went to space.\\
169 - Raj (Looking at phone): Oh, no.\\
170 - Howard: Buddy, you okay? Oh, man.\\
171 - Bernadette: What’s going on?\\
172 - Raj: Uh, go ahead. Read it.\\
173 - Howard: Raj, I can’t come to the party. This is all just too much for me. I don’t think we should see each other any more. Sorry. Lucy.\\
174 - Raj: Excuse me.\\
175 - Penny: Raj, I’m so sorry.\\
176 - Amy: Me, too.\\
177 - Sheldon: It did not kill me when you went to space. Monkeys went to space.\\
178 - Scene: Penny’s car, outside the Airport.\\
179 - Penny: Well, here we are.\\
180 - Leonard: Yep. I’m really gonna miss you.\\
181 - Penny: I’m gonna miss you, too.\\
182 - Sheldon: Penny, we’re in the red zone. The white zone is for loading and unloading. We’re breaking the law.\\
183 - Penny: Okay, there’s no space in the white zone, so…\\
184 - Leonard: Anyway, we can e-mail, and I think the phone connections are pretty good.\\
185 - Sheldon: All right, you have to get out of the car right now. I’m not going to jail for you.\\
186 - Leonard: Would you just relax?\\
187 - Sheldon: Oh, I see a space in the white zone. Quick, circle the airport.\\
188 - Penny: Did you bring enough inhalers?\\
189 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
190 - Penny: And, uh, extra Dramamine? You remember what happened on It’s a Small World.\\
191 - Leonard: I’m covered.\\
192 - Penny: Okay.\\
193 - Sheldon: Oh, dear Lord, a police officer’s glancing in our direction. We’ve been made.\\
194 - Leonard: Calm down. I’m getting out. I have something I want to give you.\\
195 - Penny: Oh, Leonard.\\
196 - Sheldon: It’s just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of Leonard’s face in it. He got it at the mall on clearance. Now move, move, move.\\
197 - Penny: I love you.\\
198 - Leonard: I love you, too.\\
199 - Sheldon: Don’t worry, Officer. They just love each other. We’re not smuggling drugs.\\
200 - Scene: Raj’s apartment. \\
201 - Penny: Raj, it’s Penny. Are you in there?\\
202 - Raj: Hang on.\\
203 - Penny: Hey. I’m just coming back from the airport. I wanted to see how you’re doing.\\
204 - Raj: That’s, that’s very nice of you. Uh, come, come. Come on in.\\
205 - Penny: Can’t stay long. I left Sheldon in the car with the window cracked open. He’s gonna go through that activity book in, like, 30 seconds, so… Are you okay?\\
206 - Raj: No.\\
207 - Penny: Oh. I’m so sorry.\\
208 - Raj: No. It’s my fault. You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I, I drove her away.\\
209 - Penny: Oh, Raj.\\
210 - Raj: Penny, I, I miss her already.\\
211 - Penny: I know how you feel. I miss Leonard, too.\\
212 - Raj: What’s like, what is wrong with me? Why, why can’t I ever have love?\\
213 - Penny: You will.\\
214 - Raj: No, I, I won’t. I’m, I’m unlovable.\\
215 - Penny: That’s just the booze talking.\\
216 - Raj: No, it’s not. I haven’t had a drink since last night.\\
217 - Penny: You’re talking to me.\\
218 - Raj: I am. And now I’m crying for a whole different reason!\\
219 - Penny: Oh, me, too.\\
220 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
221 - Raj: So I guess what I’m saying is I get where Lucy’s coming from.\\
222 - Penny: That’s great. Do you want some wine?\\
223 - Raj: Uh, no, water’s fine. Anyhow, I’ve been thinking about it a lot and, and I totally see why Lucy did what she did. I pushed too hard. But you know what? If I back off and give her enough space, maybe there’s still a future for us. Yeah, the funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimes…\\
224 - Amy: Does he ever shut up?\\
225 - Raj: … but then it turns good again, and that means it’s better than if it had never been bad for a while. I know that now, thing’s aren’t good, they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh how I cried. It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face. But I’m a man, okay? So I need to pull myself together, pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean, it’s not all bad, right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you, so, you know, a silver lining….

\subsection {Episode 01: The Hofstadter Insufficiency}
1 - Scene: On the deck of a ship on the North Sea, in the middle of a storm. Leonard is on a sat-phone.\\
2 - Leonard: Sheldon, it’s not a great time, what do you want?\\
3 - Sheldon (in the apartment): Hello to you, too. I’m sorry, but this is important.\\
4 - Leonard: What is it?\\
5 - Sheldon: Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case, and Back to the Future III was, get this, in the Back to the Future II case.\\
6 - Leonard: So?\\
7 - Sheldon: So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?\\
8 - Leonard: Sheldon, I got to go inside. It’s getting rough out here.\\
9 - Sheldon: You’re dodging the question, I knew it was you. What was that?\\
10 - Leonard: What was what?\\
11 - Sheldon: This isn’t a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken.\\
12 - Leonard: Okay, I’m hanging up now. You know there’s no such thing as a k… (Leonard is attacked and dragged into the sea by a huge tentacle. Sheldon wakes up in bed.)\\
13 - Sheldon: No!\\
14 - Scene: Penny’s apartment door.\\
15 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. \\
16 - Penny: What’s the matter?\\
17 - Sheldon: Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind you’d get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed.\\
18 - Penny: Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?\\
19 - Sheldon: To be honest, I did.\\
20 - Penny: Aw.\\
21 - Sheldon: Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case. Leonard did it.\\
22 - Penny: Good night.\\
23 - Sheldon: No, wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you don’t miss Leonard as much, uh, ’cause you’re being kind of a baby about it.\\
24 - Penny: You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you.\\
25 - Sheldon: You’re welcome. Good night.\\
26 - Credits sequence.\\
27 - Scene: The cafeteria. \\
28 - Raj: I think you’d be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, Lucy, and I didn’t get upset at all.\\
29 - Howard: I’m proud of you.\\
30 - Raj: Well, you should be, ’cause she was looking good.\\
31 - Sheldon: Dear Lord, you’re an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. Gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way.\\
32 - Raj: Is that true?\\
33 - Sheldon: Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace.\\
34 - Howard: Come on, you can talk to girls now. It shouldn’t be hard for you to meet someone new.\\
35 - Raj: How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look, I see Lucy’s face? Tell me you don’t see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie.\\
36 - Howard: Oh, will you stop it. Now, listen to me, there’s a welcome party for incoming post-docs tonight. Go to it and meet someone who isn’t made of grease or pie.\\
37 - Raj: You think you’re so cool because your wife is a person?\\
38 - Howard: Look, Bernie’s at a neuroscience conference with Amy, I’ll go with you.\\
39 - Raj: You would do that for me?\\
40 - Howard: Of course. You’re my friend. I want you to be happy.\\
41 - Raj: Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amy’s out of town, would you like to join us?\\
42 - Sheldon: I want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it.\\
43 - Scene: A hotel room.\\
44 - Bernadette (on phone): Howie, stop. I can’t talk like that. Amy’s right here.\\
45 - Amy (on phone): Sheldon, stop. For the last time, I will not bring home bed bugs. \\
46 - Bernadette: The hotel’s nice. There’s a pool, a gym, the bar looks like fun. \\
47 - Amy: Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs.\\
48 - Bernadette: Aw, I love you, too. If I don’t talk to you before you go to sleep, I’ll meet you in dreamland.\\
49 - Amy: Good night. No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag.\\
50 - Scene: The apartment.\\
51 - Sheldon: Penny, did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains…\\
52 - Penny: No.\\
53 - Sheldon: Well, now that I’ve piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess.\\
54 - Penny: Why don’t you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?\\
55 - Sheldon: You overestimate his significance in my life.\\
56 - Penny: Mmm.\\
57 - Sheldon: Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I don’t think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code? (Taps out No in morse code on the table)\\
58 - Penny: Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot.\\
59 - Sheldon: Well, I try.\\
60 - Penny: All right, let’s just get this stupid game over with.\\
61 - Sheldon: Great. I’ll go first.\\
62 - Penny: Okay.\\
63 - Sheldon: By the way, how are you with zippers?\\
64 - Penny: Why?\\
65 - Sheldon: Well, I really need to go to the bathroom, and this one’s gone all cattywampus.\\
66 - Scene: The mixer party. \\
67 - Raj: Wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting. \\
68 - Girl: It is. You can download my paper off the university server.\\
69 - Raj: I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well.\\
70 - Girl: I will.\\
71 - Raj: All right.\\
72 - Howard: How’d it go?\\
73 - Raj: Well, if you like dry, factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence, it was bananas.\\
74 - Howard: Check it out. Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here. She’s probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.\\
75 - Raj: Oh, great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed.\\
76 - Howard: I heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad.\\
77 - Raj: That’s so much better than the old, ugly ones.\\
78 - Mrs Davis: Mr. Wolowitz, Dr. Koothrappali. \\
79 - Howard: Mrs. Davis, nice to see you. \\
80 - Raj: You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins.\\
81 - Mrs Davis: Okay.\\
82 - Raj: So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they’re adorable.\\
83 - Howard: It was better when you couldn’t talk to women.\\
84 - Scene: The hotel bar.\\
85 - Bernadette: I was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory.\\
86 - Amy: Oh, brain lesions are fascinating. Unless they’re yours, then they’re a drag.\\
87 - Bernadette: To the advancement of science.\\
88 - Amy: And to the sick and dying who make it possible.\\
89 - Bernadette: This is fun, we never really get to talk shop with Penny around. We usually just end up talking about boys.\\
90 - Amy: Which is fine, but it’s nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation.\\
91 - Waiter: From the two gentlemen at the bar.\\
92 - Amy: Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks, boys bought us drinks. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.\\
93 - Bernadette: Be cool.\\
94 - Amy: You be cool. Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to Penny.\\
95 - Bernadette: You’re right. Thank you.\\
96 - Scene: The apartment.\\
97 - Sheldon: Ooh. Bad move.\\
98 - Penny: Really? Why?\\
99 - Sheldon: My queen can now take your rook from below.\\
100 - Penny: So that means I lose, right? It’s over?\\
101 - Sheldon: If I make this move, but I won’t because we’re having too much fun.\\
102 - Penny: Okay, let’s take a break. \\
103 - Sheldon: We’re all out of alcohol.\\
104 - Penny: I wasn’t going to get alcohol. Gosh, I wonder what Leonard’s doing right now. I miss him so much.\\
105 - Sheldon: Well, if you’d like, we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As I’ve explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said, I am a rock, I am an i-i-i-island.\\
106 - Penny: I’m calling him.\\
107 - Sheldon: Oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone.\\
108 - Leonard (on board boat, at a party, dancing): Excuse me, ladies, my pants are buzzing. North Sea, how can I kelp you?\\
109 - Penny: Leonard?\\
110 - Leonard: Penny? Hey, it’s Penny. Everybody say hi to Penny.\\
111 - Everybody: Hi, Penny!\\
112 - Penny: Wow, it sounds like you’re having a good time.\\
113 - Leonard: Best time of my life. \\
114 - Sheldon: Isn’t it five thirty in the morning there?\\
115 - Leonard: Is it? Hey, everybody, it’s five thirty in the morning!\\
116 - Penny: Uh, okay, well, we were just calling you because we were missing you.\\
117 - Random voice: Iceberg!\\
118 - Leonard: Uh-oh, hang on.\\
119 - Sheldon: Are you in danger?\\
120 - Leonard: No, it’s a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!\\
121 - Everybody: Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg!\\
122 - Penny: Leonard, Leonard? I cannot believe we were missing that jerk.\\
123 - Sheldon: You were.\\
124 - Scene: The hotel bar.\\
125 - Amy: So what happened? How’d it go?\\
126 - Bernadette: It’s fine. I thanked them again and let them know we’re not available.\\
127 - Amy: So I can drink this without having to give up the goodies?\\
128 - Bernadette: Yes, it’s all cool. Although, if you wanted to talk to one of them, no one would blame you.\\
129 - Amy: And why would no one blame me?\\
130 - Bernadette: I don’t know what I’m saying.\\
131 - Amy: Well, it sounds like you’re saying that I could do better than Sheldon.\\
132 - Bernadette: Boy, these drinks are strong. Hoo, mama, I’m gonna be huggin’ the toilet tonight.\\
133 - Amy: No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that.\\
134 - Bernadette: I just meant that you’re not married and your boyfriend’s kind of, Sheldon.\\
135 - Amy: And your husband is extremely Howard. What’s your point?\\
136 - Bernadette: Sorry. I have no point. That was a stupid thing to say. Can we please just go back to having a nice time?\\
137 - Amy: We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and I remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo.\\
138 - Bernadette: Come on. I apologize. Can we please just let it go?\\
139 - Amy: Sure.\\
140 - Bernadette: Thanks.\\
141 - Amy: Your husband’s weird and his clothes are ridiculous.\\
142 - Scene: The apartment.\\
143 - Penny: I can’t believe it. All this time I’ve been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?\\
144 - Sheldon: That you’re having to process your emotional pain without vodka?\\
145 - Penny: No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all.\\
146 - Sheldon: Allow me to comfort you. At least you’ve got your health.\\
147 - Penny: Really? That, that’s it? That’s comforting?\\
148 - Sheldon: Um, uh, in a hundred years, you’ll both be dead and it won’t matter?\\
149 - Penny: No. Come on, you’re supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason he’s partying is to cover up his pain.\\
150 - Sheldon: Oh, no, I don’t think that’s true at all.\\
151 - Penny: This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he’s off having a good time?\\
152 - Sheldon: Well, perhaps you’re obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?\\
153 - Penny: Okay, that, that’s great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now.\\
154 - Sheldon: Actually, I can’t. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that I’d take care of you.\\
155 - Penny: He did?\\
156 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
157 - Penny: Oh, that’s really sweet.\\
158 - Sheldon: Plus, if I do a good job, he said he’d bring me back a sailor’s cap.\\
159 - Penny: Well, now I miss him even more.\\
160 - Sheldon: Well, if it’s any consolation, I’m sure Leonard’s tormented every moment he’s away from your warm embrace and cherry lips.\\
161 - Penny: Thanks.\\
162 - Sheldon: Oh, seriously?\\
163 - Scene: The mixer.\\
164 - Raj: Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?\\
165 - Mrs Davis: What?\\
166 - Raj: I’d like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys.\\
167 - Mrs Davis: Forget about it.\\
168 - Raj: You know, you, you and I, you and I have a lot in common.\\
169 - Mrs Davis: Is that right?\\
170 - Raj: Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay, fine, I’ll tell you about it.\\
171 - Scene: The apartment.\\
172 - Sheldon: Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. It’s in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.\\
173 - Penny: Come on. It’s still early. Let’s do something.\\
174 - Sheldon: Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4D chess.\\
175 - Penny: How about we just talk?\\
176 - Sheldon: All right. In 4D chess…\\
177 - Penny: No. Come on, let’s talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don’t know.\\
178 - Sheldon: I own nine pairs of pants.\\
179 - Penny: Okay, that, that’s a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal.\\
180 - Sheldon: I see. I own nine pairs of underpants.\\
181 - Penny: How about I go first?\\
182 - Sheldon: But I don’t want to know how many underpants you own. Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I’d say it’s a thousand.\\
183 - Penny: Okay, look, here’s something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came out.\\
184 - Sheldon: I’ve seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you.\\
185 - Penny: Oh, God.\\
186 - Sheldon: And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations you’re going for. Okay, here’s one I thought I’d take to the grave.\\
187 - Penny: Okay.\\
188 - Sheldon: Hmm. A while back, YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people I’m okay with it, but I’m really not.\\
189 - Penny: That’s your big revelation?\\
190 - Sheldon: Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter.\\
191 - Penny: Okay, you know what? I give up. I’m going to bed.\\
192 - Sheldon: Here’s something else you don’t know about me. You just hurt my feelings.\\
193 - Penny: What did I do?\\
194 - Sheldon: I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing.\\
195 - Penny: I, I didn’t think it was a big deal.\\
196 - Sheldon: It is to me; that’s the point.\\
197 - Penny: Sheldon, you are right. I’m really sorry. I should’ve known better.\\
198 - Sheldon: Your apology is accepted.\\
199 - Penny: Thank you. How about a hug?\\
200 - Sheldon: How about a hearty handshake?\\
201 - Penny: Come on.\\
202 - Sheldon: Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.\\
203 - Scene: The hotel room.\\
204 - Bernadette: Good night.\\
205 - Amy: Mm-hmm. It was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.\\
206 - Bernadette: Yeah, that felt nice.\\
207 - Amy: Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes.\\
208 - Bernadette: So, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone with them, which one would you have picked?\\
209 - Amy: I think I would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.\\
210 - Bernadette: Oh, good, ’cause I liked the tall thin one. He seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced, like I’d have to teach him a thing or two.\\
211 - Amy: Not my guy. I caught him staring at my rack. It’d be nice to be with a man who wants to know what’s underneath my cardigan. FYI, it’s another cardigan.\\
212 - Bernadette: Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.\\
213 - Amy: Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon.\\
214 - Both: Good night.\\
215 - Scene: The mixer.\\
216 - Mrs Davis: All right, Dr. Koothrappali, it’s been nice talking to you, but I need to go home and relieve my babysitter.\\
217 - Raj: Yeah, I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog.\\
218 - Mrs Davis: Yeah, it’s exactly the same thing. Good night.\\
219 - Raj: Mrs. Davis, I, uh, I must confess, I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead I got to connect with you at a human level. That’s a much better evening. You’re a lovely person.\\
220 - Mrs Davis: Are you hitting on me?\\
221 - Raj: No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting on you, you’d know it ’cause you’d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.\\
222 - Mrs Davis: You’re sweet. Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.\\
223 - Raj: Good night.\\
224 - Howard: Looks like she accepted your apology.\\
225 - Raj: And then some. I think we had a moment.\\
226 - Howard: Oh, please, you did not have a moment.\\
227 - Raj: Who died and made you king of moments?\\
228 - Howard: Okay, fine. Let’s say there was a moment.\\
229 - Raj: There was.\\
230 - Howard: There wasn’t. But, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?\\
231 - Raj: I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.\\
232 - Howard: So nothing.\\
233 - Raj: No, not a thing.\\
234 - Scene: A bathroom shower.\\
235 - Penny (acting): Ah, I’m so glad the police finally caught that psychotic genetically engineered ape.\\
236 - Leonard (on ship): That is my girlfriend. I swear to God.\\
237 - Everyone (on ship): Leonard! Leonard! Leonard! Leonard!\\
238 - Penny: Aaaaaaah!
\subsection {Episode 02: The Deception Verification}
1 - Scene: The stairwell\\
2 - Sheldon: And here’s another interesting weather fact.\\
3 - Penny: Another? Great.\\
4 - Sheldon: Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer.\\
5 - Penny: Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.\\
6 - Sheldon: Joke if you must, but you’re going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store.\\
7 - Penny: You know, I will miss this.\\
8 - Sheldon: I’ll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we’ll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can even push the cart. Please don’t take my looking forward to Leonard’s return as criticism of the job you’ve been doing in his absence.\\
9 - Penny: I won’t.\\
10 - Sheldon: That criticism will come later in your report card.\\
11 - Penny: Yeah, I didn’t stay for the detention, I’m not gonna read the report card.\\
12 - Leonard (in Penny’s apartment): Hello.\\
13 - Penny (screams): Leonard! Hi!\\
14 - Leonard: Keep your voice down.\\
15 - Penny: Oh, my God. You weren’t supposed to be here till Sunday.\\
16 - Leonard: We finished the experiment early, so I thought I’d come home and surprise you.\\
17 - Penny: Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?\\
18 - Leonard: I didn’t tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days alone.\\
19 - Penny: Oh, that is so romantic.\\
20 - Leonard: Uh, sure, that’s why I did it.\\
21 - Penny: Oh, I just cannot believe you’re here.\\
22 - Sheldon (off): Penny, it’s your lucky day. Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys.\\
23 - Credits sequence.\\
24 - Scene: The comic book store.\\
25 - Sheldon: Uh, Stuart, I was wondering if you could help me find something.\\
26 - Stuart: Happy to, unless it’s hope or a reason to live.\\
27 - Sheldon: Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As he’s been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate.\\
28 - Stuart: Okay, well, I don’t know how much you want to spend, but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.\\
29 - Sheldon: Aquaman? Oh, this isn’t a gag gift, Stuart.\\
30 - Stuart: Yeah, just as well. It’s a pretty rare piece. I’d rather just sell it to a real collector.\\
31 - Sheldon: I’m a real collector. How rare is it?\\
32 - Stuart: Oh, I shouldn’t even have mentioned it. How about a Batman squirt gun?\\
33 - Sheldon: Don’t try and trick me into buying something I don’t want. Now let’s talk Aquaman.\\
34 - Howard: What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus’s mind in Spider-Man’s body?\\
35 - Raj: Well, I’ve been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions, original and Lohan.\\
36 - Howard: Both versions: original and Lohan. You’re an idiot.\\
37 - Raj: Hey, what’s your problem?\\
38 - Howard: I’m sorry, I’ve been kind of snippy lately. It’s probably this stupid diet I’m on.\\
39 - Raj: Why are you on a diet?\\
40 - Howard: I’ve put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in the men’s section.\\
41 - Raj: Well, we’ve all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost.\\
42 - Sheldon: Twelve hundred dollars. That’s my final offer.\\
43 - Stuart: All right, Sheldon, you win. I’m sure Leonard is gonna love this.\\
44 - Sheldon: Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun.\\
45 - Stuart: Ooh, yeah, I don’t know. This squirt gun, it’s, uh, it’s pretty rare.\\
46 - Sheldon: Oh.\\
47 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
48 - Leonard: And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat.\\
49 - Penny: Ah.\\
50 - Leonard: And, oh, that’s me getting rescued after I fell in.\\
51 - Penny: Oh. (Knock on door) Oh, that’s the pizza.\\
52 - Leonard: Yep. Here’s some money.\\
53 - Penny: Thank you.\\
54 - Leonard: And I’m gonna hit the head. That’s what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.\\
55 - Penny: Hey.\\
56 - Pizza guy: Twenty-two fifty.\\
57 - Penny: Okay, here’s, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change.\\
58 - Pizza guy: Seriously? I just walked up, like, four flights of stairs.\\
59 - Penny: Oh. Okay. Well, here’s, um, thirty something cents and a promise I won’t call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana.\\
60 - Sheldon: Oh, Penny, I see you’ve ordered pizza. I have Chinese food.\\
61 - Penny: That’s nice.\\
62 - Sheldon: Oh, that’s a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns.\\
63 - Penny: Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so…\\
64 - Sheldon: Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport.\\
65 - Penny: Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks. (Toilet flushes) Have a good night!\\
66 - Sheldon: What, now, do you have company?\\
67 - Penny: No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet’s been doing that. I called the building manager, so…\\
68 - Sheldon: Oh, I can take a look at it.\\
69 - Penny: Well…\\
70 - Sheldon: I’m quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet.\\
71 - Penny: Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it’s okay. You don’t have to go into the bathroom.\\
72 - Sheldon: That’s curious. If there’s no one here, why are there two glasses of wine on the table?\\
73 - Penny: Oh. Well, you know, I, I’ve got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem.\\
74 - Sheldon: Of course. Ask a silly question.\\
75 - Penny: Oh.\\
76 - Sheldon: That’s odd.\\
77 - Penny: Um, what?\\
78 - Sheldon: There are takeout containers in the trash can.\\
79 - Penny: So? That’s my dinner from last night.\\
80 - Sheldon: What’s odd is they’re in the trash can.\\
81 - Penny: Okay. Look, honey, I promise there’s no one’s here. I‘ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.\\
82 - Sheldon: Oh, very well. I’m no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. Oh!\\
83 - Penny: What?\\
84 - Sheldon: Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?\\
85 - Penny: No.\\
86 - Sheldon: Oh, great. Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?\\
87 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
88 - Bernadette: Hi, honey.\\
89 - Howard: Hey.\\
90 - Bernadette: I made some brownies. You want one?\\
91 - Howard: You’re kidding, right? I mean, you know I’m trying to lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage.\\
92 - Bernadette: We are. Stop it. And for the last time, you’re not fat.\\
93 - Howard: Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale, ’cause one of you is lying.\\
94 - Bernadette: Fine, forget I asked. How was dinner at your mom’s?\\
95 - Howard: Awful. I had to rub her ointment all over her again.\\
96 - Bernadette: Why can’t she do it?\\
97 - Howard: ‘Cause we’ve got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn’t take into account the square footage of her back.\\
98 - Bernadette: Let me see. How long have you been putting this on her?\\
99 - Howard: I don’t know. Few weeks. Why?\\
100 - Bernadette: This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell me you’ve been wearing gloves.\\
101 - Howard: Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.\\
102 - Bernadette: Howie, the oestrogen’s getting absorbed by your skin. That’s why you’ve been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass.\\
103 - Howard: You’re full of oestrogen and you don’t act like that.\\
104 - Bernadette: That’s ’cause I’m a woman. I’ve had years of practice riding the dragon.\\
105 - Howard: Fine. I’ll wear gloves next time.\\
106 - Bernadette: It’s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system.\\
107 - Howard: I feel so stupid. And fat.\\
108 - Bernadette: It’s okay. You still look great to me. In fact, why don’t we go in the bedroom and I’ll prove it to you?\\
109 - Howard: s*x? Really? I mean, that’s just your solution to everything.\\
110 - Scene: The apartment.\\
111 - Amy: Oh, and here’s a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. Janko is spelled with a silent ptang. Sheldon, you’re not even listening to the rules of my made-up language.\\
112 - Sheldon: Yes, I am.\\
113 - Amy: Then what does tweepadock mean?\\
114 - Sheldon: Uh, elephant?\\
115 - Amy: Lucky guess.\\
116 - Sheldon: I’m sorry. I’m just distracted by something that happened over at Penny’s.\\
117 - Amy: What happened?\\
118 - Sheldon: I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.\\
119 - Amy: What?\\
120 - Sheldon: She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard’s lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions.\\
121 - Amy: I don’t think Penny would cheat on Leonard.\\
122 - Sheldon: Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It’s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity.\\
123 - Amy: You’re being ridiculous.\\
124 - Sheldon: Amy, there were Chinese food containers in the trash can.\\
125 - Amy: Poor Leonard.\\
126 - Scene: Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny’s door.\\
127 - Amy: Do you hear anything?\\
128 - Sheldon: I hear a woman’s voice.\\
129 - Amy: Is it Penny?\\
130 - Sheldon: No, it’s you. All right, I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing.\\
131 - Amy: Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like.\\
132 - Sheldon: There’s kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants.\\
133 - Amy: Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard.\\
134 - Sheldon: Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah, that’s it. I’m catching her in the act. (Unlocks door)\\
135 - Amy: No, Sheldon, don’t.\\
136 - Sheldon: Aha.\\
137 - Penny: What the hell?\\
138 - Sheldon: Leonard?\\
139 - Penny: Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that.\\
140 - Sheldon: Right. (Goes out.) (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha again?\\
141 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
142 - Leonard: I’m sorry, Sheldon. I should’ve told you I was back. I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny.\\
143 - Sheldon: Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you.\\
144 - Leonard: That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.\\
145 - Sheldon: Oh, no, no, let’s not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying.\\
146 - Penny: No, he doesn’t.\\
147 - Leonard: I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.\\
148 - Sheldon: Well, Leonard, I think it’s high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room.\\
149 - Leonard: The what?\\
150 - Sheldon: Amy?\\
151 - Amy: Please leave me out of this.\\
152 - Sheldon: Fine. Leonard, there’s no need for you to pretend to like me anymore.\\
153 - Leonard: Come on, I said I was sorry.\\
154 - Sheldon: No, no, you save your apologies for after you’ve had disappointing coitus with Penny.\\
155 - Penny: It was fine.\\
156 - Leonard: Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? It’s that sailor cap that you wanted. It’s neat, huh?\\
157 - Sheldon: You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?\\
158 - Leonard: I don’t. I really don’t. Just try it on. Oh, yeah.\\
159 - Amy: Hello, sailor.\\
160 - Penny: Ooh, now we’re talking.\\
161 - Sheldon: Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I’m wearing this year. Amy, you’re going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts.\\
162 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
163 - Howard: Thanks for coming over.\\
164 - Raj: No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches.\\
165 - Howard: Yeah, that’s cucumber and cream cheese. That’s turkey and loganberry. And don’t tell my hips, but I’m warming up a brie in the oven.\\
166 - Raj: Nice. So, mmm. What’s up?\\
167 - Howard: Okay, well, I’ve been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, I need you to be honest with me. Do my boobs look bigger to you?\\
168 - Raj: Well, it’s kind of hard to tell.\\
169 - Howard: Come on, Raj, it’s a yes or no question.\\
170 - Raj: I’m not sure. Um, wait. Jump up and down, let’s see if they jiggle. Uh, no, I, I still can’t tell, uh, oh, you know what? Okay, uh, give me some of this.\\
171 - Howard: Seriously?\\
172 - Raj: Do you want my help or not?\\
173 - Howard: Fine.\\
174 - Raj: Okay, yup. See, see, that, that looks like, that looks like they could be bigger. But you know, I bet, I bet when I do it, mine do the same thing.\\
175 - Howard: Yeah, they kind of do.\\
176 - Raj: Hmm. Uh, let me see something. (Grabs his boob)\\
177 - Howard: Hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive.\\
178 - Raj: Oh. Sorry, sorry, uh, okay. (Grabs boob again. Behind them, Bernadette walks in) I mean, yeah, maybe.\\
179 - Howard: Okay, let me feel. No, I am definitely up a cup size.\\
180 - Raj: You know, but, but they’re very firm, so you’ve got that going for you.\\
181 - Howard: You think?\\
182 - Raj: Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.\\
183 - Howard: Thank you. I really needed to hear that today. (Bernadette rolls eyes and walks out) Ooh, brie’s ready.\\
184 - Raj: Yay.\\
185 - Scene: The apartment.\\
186 - Leonard: Good morning.\\
187 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
188 - Leonard: So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?\\
189 - Sheldon: I’d like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.\\
190 - Leonard: Where do you think I would take you?\\
191 - Sheldon: Who knows? Uh, you said you’d be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. You say you’re taking me to work, but for all I know, I’ll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me.\\
192 - Leonard: I’m going to work. You can come if you want.\\
193 - Sheldon: Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt.\\
194 - Leonard: No, I don’t.\\
195 - Sheldon: Hurts, doesn’t it? You know, I find myself wondering if anything you’ve ever told me is true.\\
196 - Leonard: I didn’t make it back. The ship sank, I’m in hell.\\
197 - Sheldon: You say you’re from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?\\
198 - Leonard: Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren’t?\\
199 - Sheldon: All right, I’ll give you that one.\\
200 - Leonard: Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?\\
201 - Sheldon: I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.\\
202 - Leonard: Fine. What I did was wrong.\\
203 - Sheldon: I wish I could believe you.\\
204 - Leonard: You know what? I’m not driving you to work, because you’re incredibly annoying.\\
205 - Sheldon: You say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight.\\
206 - Leonard: Stop it.\\
207 - Sheldon: Keep it up?\\
208 - Leonard: Bye.\\
209 - Sheldon: Hello. So I guess you’re really holding up the other four fingers?\\
210 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
211 - Penny: Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?\\
212 - Amy: Driving Sheldon to work.\\
213 - Penny: He’s still mad at Leonard, huh?\\
214 - Amy: Well, he’s mad at you, too. He says you’re the succubus who led his friend astray.\\
215 - Penny: I don’t know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can’t be good.\\
216 - Sheldon: Thought I heard you out here.\\
217 - Penny: Hey, Sheldon.\\
218 - Sheldon: You don’t get a hey. You get a hmm.\\
219 - Penny: Come on, don’t be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months.\\
220 - Sheldon: You’re right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.\\
221 - Penny: Sheldon.\\
222 - Sheldon: I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I’m going to get in the mail now?\\
223 - Amy: Sheldon, your fight’s with Leonard. Penny’s got nothing to do…\\
224 - Sheldon: Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy’s girlfriend is my enemy.\\
225 - Amy: Really?\\
226 - Sheldon: Yes. You’re either with me or against me.\\
227 - Amy: You want to take the bus to work?\\
228 - Sheldon: Maybe there’s a third option.\\
229 - Amy: FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk.\\
230 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
231 - Leonard: So now we’re just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising.\\
232 - Howard: That’s so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation… Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here.\\
233 - Sheldon: Howard, Raj. Judas.\\
234 - Leonard: You know what? You’re a crazy person.\\
235 - Sheldon: A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army.\\
236 - Howard: Stop it.\\
237 - Sheldon: Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.\\
238 - Howard: I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two aren’t just friends. You’re best friends. And that’s a beautiful thing. I mean, Leonard, you know why he’s so mad at you? It’s ’cause he missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other day and I love him for it.\\
239 - Raj: A little loud, dude.\\
240 - Howard: So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we’re here together?\\
241 - Leonard: Okay.\\
242 - Sheldon: I suppose so.\\
243 - Howard: Thank you.\\
244 - Raj: Uh, it wasn’t anything weird. It was just to see how big they were.\\
245 - Scene: The apartment.\\
246 - Sheldon: And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures.\\
247 - Leonard: I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights.\\
248 - Penny: I’m so glad you guys are friends again.\\
249 - Sheldon: And I’m glad you and I are friends again, too.\\
250 - Penny: Aw.\\
251 - Sheldon: Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want you to have it.\\
252 - Penny: Fifty cents off Vagisil.\\
253 - Sheldon: Think of me when you apply it.\\
254 - Raj: Uh, can I just say, I’ve missed all of us hanging out together.\\
255 - Sheldon: Yeah.\\
256 - Penny: Me, too.\\
257 - Leonard: Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?\\
258 - Bernadette: Oh, that happened right after you left.\\
259 - Leonard: And no one told me?\\
260 - Howard (crying): Can’t believe we forgot to tell him.\\
261 - Penny (handing Howard the Vagisil coupon): Think of Sheldon when you apply it.
\subsection {Episode 03: The Scavenger Vortex}
1 - Scene: The Cheesecake Factory\\
2 - Raj: So, couldn’t help but notice none of you RSVP’d to my murder mystery dinner party.\\
3 - Leonard: Oh, yeah. We were meaning to do that.\\
4 - Raj: No, you weren’t because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you.\\
5 - Sheldon: I don’t think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing.\\
6 - Amy: We’re sorry, Rajesh.\\
7 - Bernadette: Maybe we can do it next week.\\
8 - Howard: Whoa, whoa, we’re not that sorry.\\
9 - Raj: Don’t worry, I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties.\\
10 - Leonard: Great.\\
11 - Sheldon: Thank you.\\
12 - Howard: Hallelujah.\\
13 - Raj: Because I’ve got something even better planned.\\
14 - Leonard: Aw.\\
15 - Howard: Why?\\
16 - Sheldon: Come on.\\
17 - Raj: Just hear me out. I’m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.\\
18 - Howard: Oh, I loved those. I did them every year there.\\
19 - Leonard: We did them at Princeton, too.\\
20 - Howard: Oh, that’s cute. Like it’s a real college.\\
21 - Sheldon: That’s amusing, I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too.\\
22 - Amy: Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that story’s more sad than funny.\\
23 - Penny: I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time.\\
24 - Leonard: Oh, these are a little different. There’s a tradition at elite universities…\\
25 - Howard: And Princeton.\\
26 - Leonard: A tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science.\\
27 - Penny: Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer.\\
28 - Raj: So, uh, who’s in?\\
29 - Leonard: I think it sounds fun.\\
30 - Amy: Yeah, me, too.\\
31 - Various: I’m in, let’s do it.\\
32 - Sheldon: I’m sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?\\
33 - Credits sequence.\\
34 - Scene: The apartment.\\
35 - Leonard: What’s all this?\\
36 - Sheldon: Oh, everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt.\\
37 - Leonard: You really think he’s gonna send us to a bowling alley?\\
38 - Sheldon: Well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams.\\
39 - Raj: Okay, everybody. Who’s ready for a scavenger hunt? (Pumping disco music) Somewhere in the city of Pasadena, I’ve hidden a golden coin. You will be faced with a total of ten puzzles. Each p… (cough) each, each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next, the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins.\\
40 - Sheldon: He is a born showman.\\
41 - Raj: Any questions?\\
42 - Howard: Yes, to be fair, do people who went to Princeton get a head start?\\
43 - Leonard: It’s not funny.\\
44 - Sheldon: No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It’s based on the premise that Princeton isn’t a very good school.\\
45 - Leonard: Ha-ha.\\
46 - Sheldon: Oh, see? Now he gets it.\\
47 - Raj: Okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two.\\
48 - Bernadette: Should we just do couples?\\
49 - Leonard: Couples sounds great. Or we could mix things up. Maybe pick names out of a hat. Whatever.\\
50 - Penny: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don’t you just admit you don’t want to be on a team with me.\\
51 - Leonard: I just said, couples sound great.\\
52 - Penny: Mm-hmm, yeah, you don’t think I’m smart enough. You think I’m gonna be a liability. Even though I totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. Yeah.\\
53 - Leonard: All right, let’s, let’s do couples. I want to.\\
54 - Penny: No, no. Let’s mix things up. I choose Sheldon, and we’re gonna kick your ass!\\
55 - Sheldon: Really? The only time I’m ever picked first for a team and I’m stuck with the liability?\\
56 - Amy: Stop that. Penny is not a liability.\\
57 - Penny: Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?\\
58 - Amy: Maybe we pick names out of a hat.\\
59 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. (Montage with scenes in the apartment and Leonard’s bedroom)\\
60 - Penny: All right, hurry up and close the door so they can’t hear us. Would you stop pouting? So, you picked my name. Get over it.\\
61 - Sheldon: Yes, and do you know what the odds are I’d pick your name?\\
62 - Penny: No.\\
63 - Sheldon: It’s not hard, one in five. Now you know why I’m pouting.\\
64 - Raj (over walkie-talkie): All right, teams. Get ready to open your first puzzle. Go. Do you see what I did? The first puzzle is a puzzle. Oh, my God, how adorable is that? I wish I had a friend like me.\\
65 - Sheldon: What are you doing? You have to start with the edges.\\
66 - Penny: Well, there’s no right way, Sheldon. I already found a few pieces that fit.\\
67 - Sheldon: Yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges. And stop wasting time.\\
68 - Howard: Wow, you’re really good at puzzles.\\
69 - Amy: I did them all the time as a kid. As my mom used to say, when you’re doing a puzzle, it’s like having a thousand friends. She was full of fun lies like that.\\
70 - Howard: If it makes you feel any better, my mom’s just full of pound cake.\\
71 - Amy: I’m sorry you got stuck with me. I bet you wanted to be with Bernadette.\\
72 - Howard: Have you ever played a game with Bernadette?\\
73 - Amy: No.\\
74 - Howard: Have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?\\
75 - Bernadette: Faster, faster, faster! Do you not know that word? It means more fast!\\
76 - Leonard: Stop yelling at me.\\
77 - Bernadette: Hey, you’ll know when I’m yelling at you.\\
78 - Penny: Ooh, ooh, it’s the comic book store. All right, come on, that’s where we have to go.\\
79 - Sheldon: But we haven’t finished the puzzle.\\
80 - Penny: But, it, it doesn’t matter. We know the answer, come on.\\
81 - Sheldon: You think you know the answer. But it could be a trick. What if when the puzzle’s complete, there’s a sign in the window that says go to the train store?\\
82 - Penny: Okay, it’s not gonna say that.\\
83 - Sheldon: Well, I hope you’re wrong. I really want to go to the train store.\\
84 - Howard: It’s the comic book store. Let’s go.\\
85 - Bernadette: Come on, numb nuts, it’s the comic book store.\\
86 - Penny: It’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store.\\
87 - Sheldon: It’s the comic book store.\\
88 - Scene: Leonard’s car.\\
89 - Leonard: Do you think Penny’s mad at me?\\
90 - Bernadette: Because you’re in the right lane behind a bus and you won’t go around it? I’m sure she finds it charming.\\
91 - Leonard: No, because I didn’t want her on my team.\\
92 - Bernadette: I’m starting to think she dodged a bullet. The slowest bullet in the world.\\
93 - Leonard: Geez, I never realized you were so competitive.\\
94 - Bernadette: Yeah, I know. Its, it’s probably because I grew up with five brothers and sisters so I had to fight for every… Oh, my God, you did not just slow down for a bird, you know they fly, right?\\
95 - Scene: Howard’s car.\\
96 - Amy: I think this is the first time we’ve ever actually been alone together.\\
97 - Howard: Huh, I guess you’re right. Wonder why that is?\\
98 - Amy: Well, off the top of my head, I’d say we don’t have a lot in common except for the people we’re involved with. Plus, when we first met, Penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you.\\
99 - Howard: Yeah. You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think.\\
100 - Amy: Such as?\\
101 - Howard: I don’t know. Tell me some things you like.\\
102 - Amy: Uh, let’s see. I like harps, Little House on the Prairie, medieval poetry, medieval literature…\\
103 - Howard: Hey, how about some music?\\
104 - Amy: Great. Sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car. He doesn’t want to be mistaken for a gang member.\\
105 - Howard: Find something you like.\\
106 - Amy: Beatles, boring. Eminem, scary. Weird Al? How old are you? Neil Diamond?\\
107 - Howard: Yeah, I love Neil Diamond.\\
108 - Amy: I love Neil Diamond.\\
109 - Both: Sweet Caroline, bum-ba-da, good times never seemed so good, so good, so good, so good. I’ve been inclined…\\
110 - Scene: The comic book store.\\
111 - Raj: Oh, hey, thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt.\\
112 - Stuart: Oh, my pleasure. Always happy to help out with fun things that I wasn’t invited to be a part of.\\
113 - Raj: Oh, congratulations. You’re the first team to arrive.\\
114 - Amy: Yes, it’s not a ruse to make fun of me. It’s a real game and I’m winning it.\\
115 - Raj: Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?\\
116 - Bernadette: Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! How am I faster than you? I’m in heels and I stopped to take a phone call.\\
117 - Leonard: I have asthma. Back off.\\
118 - Howard: Riddle me this. Arrah, Arrah, and gather round, the work of this hero is legion-bound. He multiplies N by the number of He, and in this room the thing you’ll see.\\
119 - Raj: Good riddle, huh?\\
120 - Stuart: Yeah. So when you guys plan fun activities, does my name even come up, or…?\\
121 - Raj: I invited you to my murder mystery party.\\
122 - Stuart: No, you didn’t.\\
123 - Raj: Oh.\\
124 - Penny: Ugh, we’re the last ones here, hurry up.\\
125 - Sheldon: It is a marathon, not a sprint.\\
126 - Penny: People run in a marathon.\\
127 - Sheldon: Not with a bowling ball on their back.\\
128 - Leonard: Hey, Penny, I just wanted to say good luck, and I hope there’s no hard feelings.\\
129 - Bernadette: Hey, Romeo. Repair your relationship on your own time.\\
130 - Leonard: Relax, it’s a hard puzzle. It’s gonna take a while to solve.\\
131 - Penny: Riddle me this…\\
132 - Sheldon: Got it.\\
133 - Penny: Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School is in the lead.\\
134 - Sheldon: I thought we were the Lightning Sharks.\\
135 - Howard: Hey, you know what this could mean (whispers).\\
136 - Amy: Oh, oh, that’s good. Then this would be (whispers back)\\
137 - Howard: That’s it.\\
138 - Amy: To the Neil Mobile.\\
139 - Bernadette: I knew it, we’re gonna lose.\\
140 - Leonard: Wait, I got it. I got it/\\
141 - Bernadette: Congratulations, you got it last.\\
142 - Leonard: You’re really mean, you know that?\\
143 - Stuart: So no one’s gonna buy anything.\\
144 - Scene: The geology lab at the University.\\
145 - Penny: Aha. Okay, let’s see. To continue on your quest, leave no stone unturned. Ooh.\\
146 - Sheldon: The next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks.\\
147 - Penny: Oh. Okay. Sheldon, I, I’ve got to ask, how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?\\
148 - Sheldon: Oh, simple, the ‘arrah, ‘arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah, a member of the Legion of Superheroes, known as Element Lad. And then the word He, it wasn’t the masculine pronoun, but rather H e, the abbreviation for helium. See where I’m going with this?\\
149 - Penny: Yes.\\
150 - Sheldon: Nice try. Now, Element Lad’s ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. Helium has an atomic number of two. If you multiply that by the atomic number of N, nitrogen, you get 14, which is the atomic number of? I’m just funnin’ you, silicon. And that is the most common element in the Earth’s surface. So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab.\\
151 - Penny: Wow. I can drink a beer underwater.\\
152 - Sheldon: And I’m sure your parents are proud. Now, finally, the line in this room the thing you’ll see was an obvious reference to Fantastic Four member The Thing, who’s made entirely of…\\
153 - Penny: Shut up. I solved it.\\
154 - Sheldon: Those are map coordinates. Got ‘em. Let’s go.\\
155 - Penny: Well, wait. Don’t you want to know how I figured it out?\\
156 - Sheldon: No one likes a know-it-all, Penny.\\
157 - Scene: Howard’s car.\\
158 - Howard: On the boats and on the planes.\\
159 - Amy: They’re coming to America.\\
160 - Howard: Never looking back again.\\
161 - Amy: They’re coming to America… \\
162 - Scene: Leonard’s car.\\
163 - Leonard: Um, I’m okay with you driving my car. I’m not okay with you flying my car.\\
164 - Bernadette: Don’t sweat it, my dad’s a cop. He can fix things.\\
165 - Leonard: Uh-huh. Like death?\\
166 - Bernadette (out of the window): Your kid may be an honour student but you’re a moron.\\
167 - Leonard: Penny’s not answering my texts.\\
168 - Bernadette: Who cares? Focus on the game.\\
169 - Leonard: This stupid game is why she’s mad in the first place. I’m telling her I’m quitting.\\
170 - Bernadette: No. Quitting would be the worst thing for your relationship.\\
171 - Leonard: Why?\\
172 - Bernadette: Because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are.\\
173 - Leonard: What does she think I am?\\
174 - Bernadette: How do I put this? She’s been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part. Or a cat. Or a willow.\\
175 - Leonard: I can’t believe she would say that about me.\\
176 - Bernadette: If you’re gonna cry about it there’s tissues in my purse. Unless you got some in yours. Big willow.\\
177 - Scene: Howard’s car.\\
178 - Howard: They’re coming to America, They’re coming to America.\\
179 - Amy: Today!\\
180 - Howard: Today!\\
181 - Together: Today! Today!\\
182 - Scene: Penny’s car.\\
183 - Sheldon: Okay, another 30 feet.\\
184 - Penny: Okay. Oh, it’s a bowling alley.\\
185 - Sheldon: Yes. Yes. My brain is better than everybody’s.\\
186 - Scene: The geology lab.\\
187 - Howard: Love on the rocks.\\
188 - Amy: Ain’t no big surprise.\\
189 - Howard: Just pour me a drink.\\
190 - Amy: And I’ll tell you some lies.\\
191 - Scene: The apartment stairwell. Leonard is lowering himself down the lift shaft.\\
192 - Leonard: Call me a lady part. We’ll see about that.\\
193 - Bernadette: Can you reach the clue?\\
194 - Leonard: Almost.\\
195 - Bernadette: Hurry, Sheldon and Penny were right behind us in the bowling alley.\\
196 - Leonard: Got it.\\
197 - Bernadette: Great, climb back up. Come on.\\
198 - Leonard: Yeah, Penny might be onto something.\\
199 - Scene: Penny’s car.\\
200 - Sheldon: To the planetarium.\\
201 - Penny: Let’s go.\\
202 - Scene: Leonard’s car.\\
203 - Leonard: To the tar pits.\\
204 - Bernadette: Let’s go.\\
205 - Scene: Howard’s car.\\
206 - Amy: There’s a Neil Diamond concert next month.\\
207 - Howard: Let’s go.\\
208 - Scene: The laundry room.\\
209 - Penny: Three bags, no one’s opened ‘em. we’re the first ones here.\\
210 - Sheldon: It’s dirty laundry. You’re up.\\
211 - Penny: What? Why me?\\
212 - Sheldon: Because you’ve been training for this your whole life. You live in a pile of dirty laundry.\\
213 - Bernadette: They’re here first. This is because you made me slow down for that blind guy.\\
214 - Penny: Okay, the clue must be in the bag.\\
215 - Leonard: The clue must be in the bag.\\
216 - Penny: It’s just a bunch of pants.\\
217 - Leonard: It’s just a bunch of pants.\\
218 - Penny: You know, I’m surprised you want to copy my answers since I’m not even smart enough to be on your team.\\
219 - Leonard: Well, why would you want to be on someone’s team who you like to call a, I can’t even say it in front of Sheldon.\\
220 - Penny: What are you talking about?\\
221 - Leonard: You know exactly what I’m talking about.\\
222 - Bernadette: No, she doesn’t. I just made that up.\\
223 - Leonard: Why would you do that?\\
224 - Bernadette: Because you were about to quit like a big, Sheldon, cover your ears.\\
225 - Sheldon: I’m not a child. I know the word ninny.\\
226 - Penny: Yeah, well, you should have quit ’cause I’m still gonna beat your ass.\\
227 - Bernadette: Wish I had a man like her on my team.\\
228 - Leonard: Hey, I am every bit as much of a man as Penny. Now, let’s do this.\\
229 - Sheldon: Wait, it’s not all pants, there’s one shirt.\\
230 - Penny: Oh.\\
231 - Sheldon: Hey, that’s my shirt.\\
232 - Leonard: This one is, too.\\
233 - Sheldon: No, no, that’s not mine. It has a big spot on it.\\
234 - Penny: But wait. So does this one.\\
235 - Bernadette: Maybe the spot’s the clue.\\
236 - Penny: Sheldon’s spot. The coin is in your spot.\\
237 - Sheldon: Oh, that’s clever.\\
238 - Penny (off): Hurry.\\
239 - Sheldon: Be there in a minute. I just have to pre-soak these.\\
240 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
241 - Bernadette: Stop her, Leonard, stop her.\\
242 - Penny: Well, where the hell’s the coin?\\
243 - Leonard: Wasn’t the answer Sheldon’s spot?\\
244 - Raj: Oh, yes, Leonard. Yes, it was.\\
245 - Bernadette: Then where’s the coin?\\
246 - Raj: Yes, exactly. Where is the coin? Why don’t you look in your pockets? I slipped them in there earlier today.\\
247 - Penny: I don’t get it.\\
248 - Raj: Don’t you see? When we’re all having fun together, we’re already winners. Oh, look. See? Even I’m a winner.\\
249 - Leonard: Are you kidding me?\\
250 - Penny: That is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.\\
251 - Bernadette: You suck so hard.\\
252 - Raj: Well, I thought… Come on, I didn’t want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game. And some of those puzzles were really hard and I didn’t know who was gonna get Penny.\\
253 - Penny: Run.\\
254 - Raj: Okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time.\\
255 - Penny: Run to India.\\
256 - Raj: I just wanted to do something beautiful.\\
257 - Sheldon (entering): Hey, look. I won.\\
258 - Scene: The Cheesecake Factory, karaoke night.\\
259 - Howard: Hey, she got the way to move me, Cherry,\\
260 - Amy: She got the way to groove me.\\
261 - Howard: Cherry, baby\\
262 - Amy: She got the way to move me, honey.\\
263 - Together: She got the way to groove me. She got the way to move me.\\
264 - Howard: Cherry\\
265 - Together: She got the way to groove me, yeah!
\subsection {Episode 04: The Raiders Minimization}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Sheldon: So what’d you think?\\
3 - Amy: It was good.\\
4 - Sheldon: That’s it? Good”\\
5 - Amy: I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be losing my virginity, I didn’t think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time.\\
6 - Sheldon: My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway, thank you for watching it. It’s one of my all-time favourites.\\
7 - Amy: It was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.\\
8 - Sheldon: Story problem? You, oh, Amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. I’ve watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which I can only watch when it’s still light out, but, I defy you to find a story problem. Here’s my jaw, drop it.\\
9 - Amy: All right. Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. If he weren’t in the film, it would turn out exactly the same.\\
10 - Sheldon: Oh, I see your confusion. You don’t understand. Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip.\\
11 - Amy: No, I do, and if he weren’t in the movie, the Nazis would have still found the ark, taken it to the island, opened it up and all died, just like they did. Let me close that for ya.\\
12 - Credits sequence.\\
13 - Scene: The foyer.\\
14 - Leonard: Hey.\\
15 - Penny: Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.\\
16 - Leonard: Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they don’t need me there to make it awkward. They have each other for that. So, how was school?\\
17 - Penny: Oh, good. Check it out, The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter.\\
18 - Leonard: You bought my mom’s book?\\
19 - Penny: Yeah. It’s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.\\
20 - Leonard: Oh, come on. Not that book. It, it’s got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it.\\
21 - Penny: Oh, cool. Are there pictures?\\
22 - Leonard: Seriously, please find another book.\\
23 - Penny: Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?\\
24 - Leonard: There, there’s chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just don’t talk to me about it.\\
25 - Penny: Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?\\
26 - Leonard: It was not a crisis. Apparently, I favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided.\\
27 - Penny: Oh, my God, you still go left.\\
28 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
29 - Raj: Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?\\
30 - Howard: Halle Berry. Why?\\
31 - Raj: Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online, and it’s one of the questions. And thank you, I’d kill for that woman’s bone structure.\\
32 - Leonard: Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?\\
33 - Sheldon: I’ll tell you why. Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me, so now I’m trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that.\\
34 - Howard: Because her life wasn’t enough?\\
35 - Raj: Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? It’s perfect.\\
36 - Sheldon: Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die.\\
37 - All: Aw!\\
38 - Howard: Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first.\\
39 - Leonard: Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place.\\
40 - All: Aw!\\
41 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
42 - Penny: Okay, I know you don’t want to talk about it, but can I just ask you one question about your mom’s book?\\
43 - Leonard: No.\\
44 - Penny: I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom’s make-up and wears balloon boobies.\\
45 - Leonard: They weren’t boobies, they were muscles. And the make-up was green. I was pretending to be The Hulk.\\
46 - Penny: You were wearing her bra.\\
47 - Leonard: That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?\\
48 - Penny: Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, it’s good to open up about these things.\\
49 - Leonard: Okay, fine. Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house.\\
50 - Penny: Well, why were you so angry?\\
51 - Leonard: Gee, I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I’d keep looking? The answer, by the way, June.\\
52 - Penny: Sweetie, I’m so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.\\
53 - Leonard: I do, too, but there’s not.\\
54 - Penny: Really? Are you sure about that?\\
55 - Leonard: Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Just warning you, I’m gonna go right. Don’t make a big deal out of it.\\
56 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
57 - Stuart: Is make-up really necessary?\\
58 - Raj: Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and smile. Okay, uh-uh, that one’s in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.\\
59 - Stuart: You got it.\\
60 - Raj: Okay, uh, let’s try it again. Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesn’t want to hurt you.\\
61 - Stuart: I don’t think I can give you that.\\
62 - Raj: Come on. One more time. Yeah, it’s, it’s a little blurry, but I think that works in your favour. Do you want a beer?\\
63 - Stuart: Sure. Hey, have you finished writing your profile yet?\\
64 - Raj: Almost. Oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?\\
65 - Stuart: I put unobjectionable. But now that I hear it out loud, it just seems like I’m being cocky. What did you put for your best feature?\\
66 - Raj: My parents’ money. Uh, what did you put for your best feature?\\
67 - Stuart: I put: not applicable.\\
68 - Raj: Come on, dude, you’re being too hard on yourself. You’ve got a lot of good stuff going on.\\
69 - Stuart: Really? Like what?\\
70 - Raj: Well, okay, you’re a, you’re a talented artist, you own your own business.\\
71 - Stuart: Neither of those things have ever helped me meet a woman.\\
72 - Raj: Okay, well, can we imply that you’re well-endowed?\\
73 - Stuart: I do have one oddly long testicle.\\
74 - Raj: Okay, now you’re talking like a winner!\\
75 - Scene: The apartment.\\
76 - Leonard: Whatcha doin’?\\
77 - Sheldon: Oh, it turns out Amy’s beloved Pride and Prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. He’s got too much pride, she’s got too much prejudice, it just works.\\
78 - Leonard: So you’re looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?\\
79 - Sheldon: Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke.\\
80 - Leonard: Mm-hmm. And?\\
81 - Sheldon: And I think I’ve got it. Consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?\\
82 - Leonard: Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn’t know how big he was gonna be.\\
83 - Sheldon: Of course. You know, why couldn’t she just like Ziggy? Yeah? That thing’s riddled with plot holes.\\
84 - Leonard: Sorry, buddy.\\
85 - Sheldon: Ooh, I think she’s a fan of Garfield as well. Oh, darn it, now so am I.\\
86 - Leonard: I’ll see you later. I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.\\
87 - Sheldon: Wait, hang on. You’ve spent time with Amy. Can you think of anything she’s fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn’t noticed?\\
88 - Leonard: I gotta go.\\
89 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
90 - Leonard: You ready to go?\\
91 - Penny: Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you don’t try and talk sports with the guys.\\
92 - Leonard: Some sports bar. It’s like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?\\
93 - Penny: Oh, come on. Every time we’re about to hang out with my friends, you don’t want to. It’s like, It’s too loud, or the bathroom’s too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I mean…\\
94 - Leonard: Well, you’re, you’re right. Let’s just go.\\
95 - Penny: Hey, what’s going on with you?\\
96 - Leonard: Nothing, I’m fine.\\
97 - Penny: All right, hang on. is this still about your mom’s book?\\
98 - Leonard: No. Not everything is about my mom.\\
99 - Penny: ‘Cause if you’re still upset about that, we don’t have to go.\\
100 - Leonard: Except this is totally about my mom.\\
101 - Penny: I’m so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?\\
102 - Leonard: That sounds nice. Yeah.\\
103 - Penny: Okay.\\
104 - Leonard: Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom.\\
105 - Scene: Leonard’s lab.\\
106 - Howard: Leonard, you ready for lunch?\\
107 - Leonard: One sec. Hey. Sorry.\\
108 - Howard: Hi, Penny.\\
109 - Penny: Hi. All right, sweetie. You hang in there today.\\
110 - Leonard: I’ll try, but I might be sad again tonight.\\
111 - Penny: Okay.\\
112 - Howard: Wow. s*x at work?\\
113 - Leonard: Leave it alone. That’s my girlfriend.\\
114 - Howard: Sorry.\\
115 - Leonard: Who just had s*x with me at work.\\
116 - Howard: Damn. How’d you swing that?\\
117 - Leonard: Well, whenever I talk about how awful my mom was, Penny will do anything to make me feel better.\\
118 - Howard: Seriously?\\
119 - Leonard: Look, I mean, I’m not proud of it, but it does work. I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python. Even I was bored, I just wanted to see if she’d make it to the end.\\
120 - Howard: You sound kind of proud of it.\\
121 - Leonard: I am, I’m really proud.\\
122 - Scene: The apartment.\\
123 - Amy (on webcam): Hello, Sheldon. Is everything okay?\\
124 - Sheldon: Yes. Why?\\
125 - Amy: Well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey.\\
126 - Sheldon: April 13, a dark night, indeed.\\
127 - Amy: So what can I do for you?\\
128 - Sheldon: I’m calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.\\
129 - Amy: Really?\\
130 - Sheldon: Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So I’d like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, Little House on the Prairie.\\
131 - Amy: That sounds lovely. Why are you rubbing your hands together?\\
132 - Sheldon: Um, I’m putting on lotion. Are you in or not?\\
133 - Amy: Of course I’m in.\\
134 - Sheldon: Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night, Dr. Fowler.\\
135 - Amy: Good night, Dr. Cooper.\\
136 - Sheldon: Good night, indeed. What a rube. Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?\\
137 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
138 - Bernadette: You were really quiet during dinner. Is everything okay?\\
139 - Howard: Yeah. I guess I was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was.\\
140 - Bernadette: Yeah, I bet it sucked. I’m gonna take a bath, you do the dishes.\\
141 - Howard: How about I take a bath with you and see what happens.\\
142 - Bernadette: Here’s what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna take a bath, and you’re gonna do the dishes.\\
143 - Howard: That’s it? No compassion?\\
144 - Bernadette: Aw, poor Howie. We good? I’m gonna take a bath.\\
145 - Howard: Bernie…\\
146 - Bernadette: God, what is going on with you?\\
147 - Howard: I’m sharing my pain.\\
148 - Bernadette: And I’m not buying it. Try again.\\
149 - Howard: I’m learning to be a man in a culture where it’s increasingly difficult to know how?\\
150 - Bermadette: Strike two.\\
151 - Howard: I’m copying Leonard. When he does this to Penny, they have s*x and watch Monty Python.\\
152 - Bernadette: Howard.\\
153 - Howard: I know. It was dumb, I shouldn’t have done it. And it’s making me feel sad. So sad. You know, why don’t you take a bath? I’ll do the dishes.\\
154 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
155 - Raj: Three, two, one.\\
156 - Stuart: That’s it. Our dating profiles are live on the Internet.\\
157 - Raj: Attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!\\
158 - Stuart: That’s right, ladies. For all you know, I’m confident and fun to be around.\\
159 - Raj: Oh, cool, it tells you when someone’s reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope that’s not her weight.\\
160 - Stuart: If it is, I’ll take her. Ooh, I got one, too. The ladies are coming to us. Oh, man, if I’d started this years ago, I’d be divorced two or three times by now.\\
161 - Raj: What? Another one. You know, it, it’s weird. When they’re reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?\\
162 - Stuart: Well, they’re not running away screaming, so, no.\\
163 - Scene: The apartment.\\
164 - Amy: I love Little House. It made me want to live on a farm so much I tried to milk my cat. That tangy bowl of Cheerios was not worth the stitches.\\
165 - Sheldon: Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That’s strange, since peanut butter wasn’t introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner.\\
166 - Amy: You’re trying to get back at me for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\
167 - Sheldon: That’s silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone, since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. This is more like Little House on the Preposterous.\\
168 - Amy: Sheldon, we’re in a relationship. When you get angry, just tell me. You don’t need to seek revenge.\\
169 - Sheldon: Are you sure? Every time my dad stayed out all night, my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco.\\
170 - Amy: Well, that’s not how we’re going to do it.\\
171 - Sheldon: Fine. I’m mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it.\\
172 - Amy: I shouldn’t have said it. I’m sorry.\\
173 - Sheldon: Thank you.\\
174 - Amy: Do you feel better?\\
175 - Sheldon: Yes. But not as good as I’m going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays. He’s a cat. He doesn’t have a job.\\
176 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
177 - Leonard: Hey, I was just… what is happening?\\
178 - Penny: Oh, just a little treat. I know you’ve been feeling really bad about your mom lately.\\
179 - Leonard: Oh, oh, I have. So bad.\\
180 - Penny: And I wanted to make you feel better, so I planned something very special for you.\\
181 - Leonard: Uh-huh, I can already feel it working.\\
182 - Mrs Hofstadter (on webcam): Hello, Leonard.\\
183 - Leonard: Mom?\\
184 - Mrs Hofstadter: I understand you have been whining about my parenting in order to emotionally manipulate your girlfriend.\\
185 - Leonard: I… uh…\\
186 - Penny: Bernadette told me everything. Now you don’t get the left or the right.\\
187 - Mrs Hofstadter: Let’s discuss why you continue to involve me in your s*x life.\\
188 - Leonard: Oh, please, Mommy. No, Mommy.\\
189 - Mrs Hofstadter: When you were six years old, you walked in on me and your father naked. I was swatting his bottom with your brand new Ping Pong paddle.\\
190 - Leonard: I didn’t dream that?\\
191 - Mrs Hofstadter: How did that make you feel?\\
192 - Leonard: Penny, come back. I’m sad for real now.\\
193 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
194 - Raj: In the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?\\
195 - Stuart: Combined?\\
196 - Raj: Yes.\\
197 - Stuart: Zero.\\
198 - Raj: Dude, this is, this is brutal.\\
199 - Stuart: I don’t think I’ve ever felt so rejected. And I had a rescue dog who ran back to the pound.\\
200 - Raj: This is the worst. If we’re gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school.\\
201 - Stuart: And make them look us in the eye.\\
202 - Raj: Yeah, anything is better than this.\\
203 - Scene: A bar.\\
204 - Raj: Hello.\\
205 - Girl: Not interested.\\
206 - Raj: I was wrong. This is worse.\\
207 - Scene: The apartment.\\
208 - Howard: Wait, wait, if it wasn’t for Indiana Jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse.\\
209 - Sheldon: That’s true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.\\
210 - Raj: Like a hero.\\
211 - All: Yeah!\\
212 - Leonard: Although, technically, Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. He couldn’t even get that done.\\
213 - All: Aw!
\subsection {Episode 05: The Workplace Proximity}
1 - Scene: The Cheesecake Factory\\
2 - Penny: Awkward silence, Sheldon on his phone, no touching. Somebody’s having date night.\\
3 - Amy: It’s actually steamier than it looks. Sheldon’s looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in Renaissance paintings.\\
4 - Sheldon: Oh, no, I got bored with that. I’m just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon.\\
5 - Penny: How do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?\\
6 - Sheldon: If you do that, I’ll scream.\\
7 - Amy: Sheldon, I have some exciting news to tell you.\\
8 - Sheldon: That makes two of us. My new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days. Come on, one.\\
9 - Amy: I’ve been invited to consult on an experiment at your university for a few months. Isn’t that great? We could have lunch together. We could carpool. \\
10 - Sheldon: You know, riding with Leonard has gotten a little tedious lately. The only car game he ever wants to play is the Quiet Game. And he’s terrible at it, I always win.\\
11 - Amy: So, you’re okay with this?\\
12 - Sheldon: Well, why wouldn’t I be?\\
13 - Amy: Well, this project would have us working in close proximity to one another. And there’s the vulgar adage that one should not defecate where one eats.\\
14 - Sheldon: My father used to say that all the time. That and, um, who does one have to orally gratify to get a drink around here? But what does that have to do with you working at the university?\\
15 - Amy: Sheldon, don’t defecate where you eat means don’t have a romantic relationship in the workplace.\\
16 - Sheldon: Really?\\
17 - Amy: Yes.\\
18 - Sheldon: Huh. Yeah, I always took it literally. That’s why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. Hmm.\\
19 - Amy: I’m relieved that you don’t have a problem with us working together.\\
20 - Sheldon: Not as relieved as I’m about to be. It’s a brave new world, little lady.\\
21 - Credits sequence.\\
22 - Scene: The apartment. \\
23 - Howard: Are you crazy? You don’t want your girlfriend at work with you. Hell Clam.\\
24 - Sheldon: Why not? Hairy Fairy.\\
25 - Raj: I think it could be romantic. You know, my parents met at his place of work. \\
26 - Leonard: Your father’s a gynaecologist.\\
27 - Raj: I know. What started as a pap smear turned into a date. Which turned into her working there, which turned into marriage, which then turned into hatred, which continues to this day. Two-Eyed Cyclops.\\
28 - Howard: Would you please tell him this isn’t a good idea?\\
29 - Leonard: No, no, I think it’ll be great. Maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work, she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes. Giant baby.\\
30 - Sheldon: That’s a Raging Ogre.\\
31 - Leonard: Yeah, I know.\\
32 - Howard: I’m just saying, I’d never want to work with Bernadette. Can you imagine seeing someone all day long and then you’re supposed to hang out with them after work, too?\\
33 - Raj: Hold on. We do that all the time. You and I work together and play together.\\
34 - Howard: Yeah, I know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman. Bipolar Bear.\\
35 - Sheldon: Well, I appreciate your concern, but I won’t be seeing any more of Amy than I already do. I assume we’ll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota.\\
36 - Leonard: Please let me be there when you tell her that.\\
37 - Sheldon: Why? So you can see the look on Amy’s face when she hears my top-notch idea?\\
38 - Leonard: Please, oh, please, just let me be there.\\
39 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
40 - Bernadette: So, Amy, what are you gonna be working on at Caltech?\\
41 - Amy: I’m leading a study to see if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme leads to paralyzing fear in monkeys.\\
42 - Bernadette: If they’re anything like humans, the answer’s yes.\\
43 - Amy: Wait, you’ve, you’ve done this experiment on humans?\\
44 - Bernadette: You mean like death row inmates with nothing to lose? No, that would be unethical.\\
45 - Penny: You know, not a lot of people know this, but the monoamine oxidase enzyme was discovered by a woman, Mary Bernheim. That’s right, my phone is just as smart as you guys.\\
46 - Sheldon (off): (Knock, knock, knock) Amy, Bernadette, Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy, Bernadette, Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy, Bernadette, Penny.\\
47 - Bernadette: He’s never gonna stop doing that, is he?\\
48 - Amy: I don’t mind. I’m hoping to put his love of repetition to good use someday.\\
49 - Sheldon: Hi. Um, I’ve reconsidered. Uh, you can’t work where I work. Enjoy the rest of your evening.\\
50 - Amy: Sheldon. I already signed the contract. I cashed a cheque. \\
51 - Sheldon: Mmm, you are not going to come out of this looking good.\\
52 - Penny: Sheldon, I don’t understand. I thought you said you were fine with it.\\
53 - Sheldon: Well, I was. But that was before Howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other.\\
54 - Bernadette: He said what?\\
55 - Sheldon: Now, don’t be insulted. He just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious. \\
56 - Bernadette: Excuse me, I need to have a chat with my husband.\\
57 - Sheldon: Yeah, well, now, well, keep it short. From what I gather, brevity is your friend. So, are we good here?\\
58 - Amy: No, we’re not good here. I am working on this project.\\
59 - Penny: Yeah, and you can’t tell her what she can and cannot do.\\
60 - Sheldon: Last week, you told Leonard he couldn’t wear his Wookie jacket out in public.\\
61 - Penny: That’s different. I’m not going to the mall with someone dressed like a dumb space bear.\\
62 - Amy: Sheldon, you don’t have to worry about me bothering you. I’ll be in a different building. And we don’t even have to have lunch together.\\
63 - Sheldon: Really?\\
64 - Amy: Yes. Before all things, I’m a scientist. I’m just there to do my work and, with a little luck, scare the living crap out of some monkeys.\\
65 - Sheldon: Hmm. You sure your mothlike personality won’t be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself?\\
66 - Amy: More and more sure.\\
67 - Sheldon: Well, then, you have my permission.\\
68 - Amy: I didn’t ask for your permission.\\
69 - Sheldon: Too late. No backsies.\\
70 - Howard: No, no, listen to me. Sheldon misunderstood. What I meant was, if we worked together, there’d be too much of me for you, not the other way around.\\
71 - Sheldon: Howard, if you’re going to lie to your wife, don’t start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood. That’s a dead giveaway.\\
72 - Bernadette: Well?\\
73 - Howard: Okay, fine. I did say that, and I think it’s true. I think if we worked together and lived together, we’d get sick of each other.\\
74 - Sheldon: Yeah, but to be fair, he only said the part about him getting sick of you.\\
75 - Howard: For the love of God, why?\\
76 - Bernadette: What exactly do you think you’d get sick of?\\
77 - Raj: His only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one.\\
78 - Howard: It’s nothing in particular. I…\\
79 - Bernadette: Is it my voice? Am I too bossy? What?\\
80 - Howard: My arm is feeling numb.\\
81 - Leonard: Nailed it.\\
82 - Bernadette: That’s the wrong arm for a heart attack, doofus. \\
83 - Howard: My point is, I’m sure there are things about me that would drive you crazy if you had to deal with them all day long.\\
84 - Bernadette: Like looking me in the eye and lying to me?\\
85 - Howard: Oh, well, come on, where am I supposed to look when I lie to you?\\
86 - Bernadette: Find somewhere else to sleep tonight.\\
87 - Howard: Bernie…\\
88 - Sheldon: If it makes you feel any better, Amy and I are fine. I mean, really good.\\
89 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
90 - Leonard: So, boys, how was the pyjama party? You guys jump on the bed and sing into hair brushes?\\
91 - Raj: It wasn’t a pyjama party. It was just a couple of bros hanging out, giggling, eating cookie dough and watching Princess Bride.\\
92 - Howard: Please, stop talking.\\
93 - Raj: As you wish.\\
94 - Howard: I mean, you know, Sheldon, none of this would’ve happened if I hadn’t tried to help you.\\
95 - Sheldon: Uh, it also wouldn’t have happened if, in the early universe, hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common. This is fun. Your turn.\\
96 - Amy: Gentlemen.\\
97 - Raj: Amy.\\
98 - Leonard: Hey.\\
99 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
100 - Leonard: That was kind of icy. You two okay?\\
101 - Sheldon: Oh, we’re fine. As Howard advised, she’s merely respecting our professional boundaries.\\
102 - Leonard: Smart. Take relationship advice from a man who spent last night braiding Raj’s hair.\\
103 - Sheldon: Yeah, you make a good point. It would appear I was worried for nothing. Look at her, desperately wishing she was over here at the cool table. Don’t worry, little moth. The flame will come to you.\\
104 - Raj: Oh, uh, on the off chance that Bernadette doesn’t call back and apologize, how do you feel about Mexican food for dinner tonight?\\
105 - Howard: I don’t know. Sounds kind of heavy.\\
106 - Raj: That’s ’cause you always fill up on chips.\\
107 - Amy: And this is Dr. Gunderson from Stockholm.\\
108 - Sheldon: Ah, Sweden. Yeah, home of my favourite Muppet and, uh, second favourite meatball. Okay, the Nordic reputation for lack of humour is well-founded. Boy, is his name Gunderson or No-Funderson?\\
109 - Amy: Where are we going with this, Dr. Cooper?\\
110 - Sheldon: Oh, please, I’m your boyfriend. You call me Sheldon. That’s right, I am in a boy-girl relationship with this cute little lump of wool.\\
111 - Amy: Sheldon.\\
112 - Sheldon: It’s a physical relationship, too. Hand-holding, hugging, even on hot days. Ow. Okay, here’s a new one. Apparently now we kick each other in the shin under the table. How do you like it when I do it to you? Not so much, huh?\\
113 - Scene: Amy’s lab.\\
114 - Amy: Test subject D7, aka Betsy, fear response study. Image number one, Frenchman on bicycle carrying baguettes. No visible reaction. Image number two, sousaphone. Still no reaction. Okay. Let’s kick things up a notch. Image number three, crocodile with a mouthful of monkeys. Okay, now we’re talking.\\
115 - Sheldon: Dr. Fowler?\\
116 - Amy: What do you want, Sheldon?\\
117 - Sheldon: Well, I’m done with work, so… ugh!\\
118 - Amy: Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, uh, better?\\
119 - Sheldon: Oh, baguettes. Yes, I like baguettes. What exactly are you doing?\\
120 - Amy: Determining baseline fear levels in capuchin monkeys by measuring their response to visual stimuli.\\
121 - Sheldon: So, goofing off. As I was saying, I’m done with work and Leonard’s not. So good news, you get to take me home. Play your cards right, I’ll let you drive me past the lot where the buses park at night.\\
122 - Amy: I can’t leave now, Sheldon. I’m very busy. Besides, why would I want to do you a favour after the way you treated me in the cafeteria? Image number four, boa constrictor. \\
123 - Sheldon: What on earth are you talking about? My behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful. Maybe your friend Gunderson needs to head over to IKEA and assemble a sense of humour.\\
124 - Amy: You embarrassed me in front of my colleagues on my first day here. Image number five, kitten in a teacup.\\
125 - Sheldon: Aw. Embarrassed you?\\
126 - Amy: You know what? I don’t have time for this. Find another way home.\\
127 - Sheldon: I’m starting to get the sense that you’re angry with me.\\
128 - Amy: Really? What tipped you off?\\
129 - Sheldon: Couple things, actually. Your tone of voice, your body language…\\
130 - Amy: Get out.\\
131 - Sheldon: Well, now, that.\\
132 - Amy: Image number six, woman giving birth.\\
133 - Sheldon: Bleugh!\\
134 - Scene: The apartment.\\
135 - Leonard: It’s nine o’clock, where you been?\\
136 - Sheldon: Oh, I had to take the bus home. Fell asleep and missed my stop.\\
137 - Penny: Oh, no.\\
138 - Sheldon: Did you know that Los Angeles has a Little Sri Lanka?\\
139 - Leonard: I did not.\\
140 - Sheldon: Well, I do now. They’re a lovely people. Although terrifying when you wake up face-to-face with them. If you’re hungry, I brought home some mutton and coconut milk.\\
141 - Penny: Why’d you get that? You hate lamb.\\
142 - Sheldon: I was asking for directions. Apparently, there was a communication problem.\\
143 - Leonard: I thought Amy was gonna drive you home.\\
144 - Sheldon: Yeah, I thought so, too, but she’s acting very strangely. I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan fellow on the bus, and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow. Although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-law’s witch doctor practice.\\
145 - Penny: Okay, Sheldon, what happened between you and Amy?\\
146 - Sheldon: Well, can you believe she said I embarrassed her?\\
147 - Penny: Yeah.\\
148 - Sheldon: But you didn’t even hear the details.\\
149 - Leonard: Sheldon, I’ve known you a long time, and I’m going to tell you this with all the love I can possibly muster. Amy’s right. You’re wrong.\\
150 - Sheldon: But you don’t even know…\\
151 - Leonard: Doesn’t matter.\\
152 - Sheldon: But, now, but in my defence…\\
153 - Leonard: Doesn’t matter.\\
154 - Sheldon: You’re not listening to my side of it.\\
155 - Penny: Okay, fine, Sheldon. What is your side?\\
156 - Sheldon: Well…\\
157 - Penny: Nope, got to go with Amy on this one.\\
158 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
159 - Howard: Ooh, shrimp was spicy.\\
160 - Raj: You want a TUMS?\\
161 - Howard: You got the tropical fruit kind?\\
162 - Raj: No, if I buy those, I just go through them like candy.\\
163 - Howard: Tell me about it. One time, I swear I pooped out a stick of chalk. (Knock on door) I’ll get it.\\
164 - Raj: Thanks.\\
165 - Bernadette: Hi.\\
166 - Howard: Oh, hi.\\
167 - Bernadette: I may have overreacted.\\
168 - Howard: Yeah, well, I didn’t handle it so great, either.\\
169 - Bernadette: It’s just sometimes I feel like you enjoy spending time with your friends more than with me.\\
170 - Howard: That’s not true.\\
171 - Bernadette: It’s not? You spend all day together at work, and then you all hang out at night playing games, going to the comic book store. Last week, you two got a couples massage. So, when you said you wouldn’t want to spend that much time with me, it really hurt my feelings.\\
172 - Howard: Oh, wow. Yeah, no, I get that. I’m so sorry. Starting tomorrow, I am turning over a new leaf. Time with you is my number one priority.\\
173 - Bernadette: Why tomorrow?\\
174 - Howard: Well, we’re real close to finishing off the new Batman game.\\
175 - Raj: It is awesome. Uh, you should probably go after her.\\
176 - Howard: Should I go after you?\\
177 - Bernadette (off): No!\\
178 - Howard: Thanks for getting me in trouble.\\
179 - Scene: Amy’s apartment.\\
180 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.\\
181 - Amy: Sheldon, what are you doing here so late?\\
182 - Sheldon: I couldn’t sleep because I kept thinking about what happened earlier between us. Also, I had one heck of a bus nap. Oh, speaking of which, do you want some mutton and coconut milk?\\
183 - Amy: No.\\
184 - Sheldon: Well, I cannot give this stuff away.\\
185 - Amy: What do you want?\\
186 - Sheldon: Amy, this isn’t easy to say. All relationships are difficult, but even more so when you’re in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions. And frankly, who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo.\\
187 - Amy: Sheldon, you’re not a weirdo.\\
188 - Sheldon: I wasn’t speaking about me. I mean, honestly, there’s no telling what will set you off. You know, introducing myself as your boyfriend. Giving you the opportunity to drive me home. Breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour, the funniest kind of humour.\\
189 - Amy: What’s your point?\\
190 - Sheldon: My point is, we’re a couple, and I like you for who you are, quirks and all.\\
191 - Amy: I like you, too.\\
192 - Sheldon: Well, I should hope so. I don’t see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense. Not even a good-bye? You see, that’s the kind of thing that makes people think you’re weird. Poor kid. She just doesn’t see it.\\
193 - Scene: The Cheesecake Factory Bar.\\
194 - Bernadette: I’m not apologizing to Howard. He can come beg me on his knees.\\
195 - Amy: Sheldon, too. If I see him at work, I’m just going to ignore him.\\
196 - Penny: All right, don’t worry. I talked to Leonard. He is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight.\\
197 - Scene: The apartment. \\
198 - Leonard: Laser’s warmed up.\\
199 - Howard: Pull.\\
200 - All: Yeah!
\subsection {Episode 06: The Romance Resonance}
1 - Scene: The Cheesecake Factory\\
2 - Penny: What are you working on?\\
3 - Sheldon: Can’t talk. In the zone.\\
4 - Penny: Do you know what he’s doing?\\
5 - Amy: Could be anything. Last time he was like this, he figured out electron transport in graphene. The time before that, he was making a list of who’s allowed in his tree fort if fe ever gets one. Still can’t believe I didn’t make the cut.\\
6 - Penny: Uh, Sheldon, you want to take a break? Your food’s ready.\\
7 - Leonard: No, no, what are you doing? He’s both happy and quiet. It’s like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time.\\
8 - Howard: Sorry we’re so late. Bernadette got stuck at work.\\
9 - Bernadette: Great news. A raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier and now can infect humans.\\
10 - Raj: Why is that great news?\\
11 - Bernadette: In the pharmaceutical business we have a saying, mo’ infections, mo’ money.\\
12 - Howard: Wait, Maybe you want to wash your little raccoon hands first.\\
13 - Bernadette: Oh, calm down. If I had it, I’d be dead already.\\
14 - Howard: Guys, listen up. \\
15 - Sheldon: Can’t listen, zone. Also don’t care.\\
16 - Howard: Next week is the anniversary of my first date with Bernadette.\\
17 - Sheldon: Really don’t care.\\
18 - Howard: I want to do something special, and I was hoping you guys could be a part of it.\\
19 - Penny: Aw, what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?\\
20 - Howard: Just putting something in the bank for what horrible thing I do next.\\
21 - Penny: Ah.\\
22 - Howard: Look, she’s gonna be back any second, so here’s the deal. I’m writing a song, and I was hoping we could all play it for her together.\\
23 - Leonard: Aw.\\
24 - Amy: Oh, I love that.\\
25 - Raj: That is so beautiful.\\
26 - Howard: Sheldon?\\
27 - Sheldon: When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory?\\
28 - Credits sequence\\
29 - Scene: The stairwell\\
30 - Leonard: It’s really sweet what Howard wants to do for Bernadette.\\
31 - Penny: Yeah. Hey, how come you’ve never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date?\\
32 - Leonard: Well, for starters, you’ve broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?\\
33 - Sheldon: Ooh, somebody call the burn ward. And back to the zone.\\
34 - Leonard: And besides, I do romantic things for you all the time. Can you even name one romantic thing you’ve done for me?\\
35 - Penny: I can name tons.\\
36 - Leonard: s*x doesn’t count.\\
37 - Penny: Oh. I know, what about that bed-and-breakfast?\\
38 - Leonard: Well, I took you there. All you did was…\\
39 - Penny: I know what I did. I bet they had to throw out that rocking chair. You know, I can be romantic if I want to.\\
40 - Leonard: It’s fine. And also not true.\\
41 - Penny: Okay, just you wait and see. I’m gonna romance your freakin’ ass off.\\
42 - Leonard: That’s beautiful. Is that Shakespeare?\\
43 - Penny: Sheldon?\\
44 - Sheldon: Zone.\\
45 - Leonard: He’ll figure it out when he falls off the roof.\\
46 - Scene: The apartment. \\
47 - Leonard: Sheldon, I know you’re in the zone, but do you want some tea? All right, I can’t believe I’m gonna say this, but you haven’t spoken in hours and I’m starting to get worried. Please say something.\\
48 - Sheldon: Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius.\\
49 - Leonard: Nope, it was better before.\\
50 - Sheldon: Look at it. I feel like my mind just made a baby. And it’s beautiful. It’s not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop.\\
51 - Leonard: Holy crap, Sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?\\
52 - Sheldon: Did I? Well, that can’t be right. No one’s ever done that before. Except me, because I just did it. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain…\\
53 - Leonard: Yeah, definitely better before.\\
54 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
55 - Howard: So I’m almost done writing the song for Bernadette. Are you cool playing the cello?\\
56 - Leonard: If by cool you mean willing to, yes. If by cool you mean cool, clearly you’ve never seen me play the cello.\\
57 - Howard: Great. Will you play the ukulele?\\
58 - Raj: Of course. I’d be happy to shred it on my ax.\\
59 - Howard: Or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar.\\
60 - Raj: Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face.\\
61 - Sheldon: Gentlemen. Uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. Now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. I don’t care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks. \\
62 - Howard: Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon.\\
63 - Raj: Yeah, I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired.\\
64 - Sheldon: Oh, well, thank you. Believe it or not, I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising.\\
65 - Leonard: Sheldon, that’s incredible.\\
66 - Sheldon: Yeah, I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although I’m pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See, they know how to keep people in line.\\
67 - Howard: So, what happens next?\\
68 - Sheldon: Oh, more testing, more success, more fame. Yeah, but don’t worry, I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe I’ve always been.\\
69 - Leonard: Good to know.\\
70 - Sheldon: Now give me that cookie, I discovered an element.\\
71 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. \\
72 - Penny: Thank you so much for coming.\\
73 - Raj: You called the right person. I believe I have the perfect romantic evening for you to give Leonard.\\
74 - Penny: Okay, good, ’cause I’ve been really struggling with this.\\
75 - Raj: As I’m sure you’re aware, the quickest way to a man’s heart is through his…\\
76 - Penny: Pants, but Leonard says s*x doesn’t count.\\
77 - Raj: Oh. You poor thing. You have one arrow in your quiver, and you just can’t use it. Fortunately, another pathway to a man’s heart is through his stomach. \\
78 - Penny: I don’t know if I want to cook for him. He’s kind of a picky eater. I mean, it’s too salty, it’s too dry, it’s too burnt and frozen at the same time. Okay, come on, what else would sweep you off your feet?\\
79 - Raj: Well, I’ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But boy, oh, boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition.\\
80 - Penny: Okay, that’s just the plot for Dirty Dancing. What else would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze’s head.\\
81 - Raj: Oh, oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside his window with a boom box in the air.\\
82 - Penny: That’s from Say Anything.\\
83 - Raj: Look, I’m a lonely guy, I watch a lot of movies. Look, Penny, if you truly want to be romantic, it needs to come from you.\\
84 - Penny: I get that, but why is this so hard?\\
85 - Raj: Well, you’ve probably never had to do this stuff ’cause you’re young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you.\\
86 - Penny: Yeah, I’m trying to be sad about that. I can’t.\\
87 - Scene: The apartment.\\
88 - Sheldon: Let’s see, what’s next? Okay, here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery.\\
89 - Amy: I don’t think the Smithsonian’s gonna want your marker. \\
90 - Sheldon: And that’s why you’re not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess who’s getting an article written about him in Physics Today? I’ll give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday.\\
91 - Amy: Sheldon, I’m so proud of you.\\
92 - Sheldon: Well, you should be. My discovery is spreading like wildfire. Unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean.\\
93 - Amy: What’s next?\\
94 - Sheldon: This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and…\\
95 - Amy: And what?\\
96 - Sheldon: No. No, no, no, no.\\
97 - Amy: What’s wrong?\\
98 - Sheldon: I’ve made a horrible mistake.\\
99 - Amy: What are you talking about?\\
100 - Sheldon: This table, it’s in square centimetres. I read it as square metres. You know what that means?\\
101 - Amy: That Americans can’t handle the metric system?\\
102 - Sheldon: Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000. \\
103 - Amy: But the Chinese team found the element.\\
104 - Sheldon: Yeah, well, they shouldn’t have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didn’t know about.\\
105 - Amy: So you just got lucky?\\
106 - Sheldon: Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.\\
107 - Amy: You and me both, brother. It doesn’t matter. The element was found because of you, and that’s groundbreaking.\\
108 - Sheldon: What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. I’m not a genius, I’m a fraud.\\
109 - Amy: You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, we’re forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else.\\
110 - Sheldon: Oh, great. Now I’m worse than a fraud. I’m practically a biologist.\\
111 - Scene: Leonard’s car.\\
112 - Leonard:: You got to stop beating yourself up over this. I mean, you made a mistake, but it was a happy mistake.\\
113 - Sheldon: There’s nothing happy about it. I’m being given credit that I don’t deserve. \\
114 - Leonard: Oh, people get things they don’t deserve all the time. Look at me with you. \\
115 - Sheldon: No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. I’ve got to find a way to stop this thing.\\
116 - Leonard: Buddy, I don’t think you can. I mean, once it’s out there, it’s out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a s*x tape.\\
117 - Sheldon: You know, frankly, I’d prefer a s*x tape.\\
118 - Leonard: You don’t know what a s*x tape is, do you?\\
119 - Sheldon: No.\\
120 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
121 - Howard: Make sure you guys get to the restaurant by eight. Bernadette’s meeting me there at eight thirty and I don’t want to blow the surprise.\\
122 - Leonard: We’ll be there.\\
123 - Raj: Got it. Now, uh, I have a question about the song. I was thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap.\\
124 - Howard: E-Ni-Ni-Ni-Ni-No.\\
125 - Raj: Come on, come on, you haven’t even heard it yet. Leonard, give me a beat.\\
126 - Leonard: I will not.\\
127 - Raj: Oh, please?\\
128 - Howard: No, I want this to be romantic.\\
129 - Raj: It will be. I don’t call anyone a ho, and the only time I use the phrase my bitch, I’m referring to you.\\
130 - Voice: There he is. (General applause) \\
131 - Sheldon: Stop it. Stop celebrating me.\\
132 - Voice: Woo!\\
133 - Sheldon: And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You’re fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn’t the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future.\\
134 - Raj: Wait, I don’t understand. They didn’t find the element?\\
135 - Sheldon: Oh, no, they found the element. (More applause) No, no, stop it. I don’t need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?\\
136 - Leonard: Invite them to live with us.\\
137 - Scene: A restaurant.\\
138 - Penny: Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this.\\
139 - Leonard: Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.\\
140 - Penny: Okay, you know what’s not romantic? Rubbing it in someone’s face.\\
141 - Leonard: Actually, it can be, but I told you s*x doesn’t count.\\
142 - Howard: I’m getting worried about Bernadette. I’m gonna call and check on her.\\
143 - Sheldon: The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.\\
144 - Raj: Oh, that’s a big deal.\\
145 - Sheldon: I know. When will this nightmare end?\\
146 - Leonard: Hey, I get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still, what you did is amazing. We’re really proud of you.\\
147 - Amy: I’m not.\\
148 - Sheldon: You’re not?\\
149 - Amy: Sheldon, I’ve been thinking about it, and you’re right. You don’t deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I’m embarrassed for you.\\
150 - Sheldon: That’s the most romantic thing I’ve ever heard.\\
151 - Penny: Damn it, everyone’s better at this than me.\\
152 - Sheldon: Congratulations, Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort.\\
153 - Howard: Guys, there was an accident at Bernie’s lab.\\
154 - Leonard: Oh, my God, is she okay?\\
155 - Howard: Yeah, but she’s at the hospital in quarantine.\\
156 - Penny: What?\\
157 - Amy: Poor Bernadette.\\
158 - Leonard: Oh, no.\\
159 - Sheldon: I hate to pile on the bad news, but I just got a raise.\\
160 - Scene: The hospital. \\
161 - Howard: Oh, my God, Bernie, what happened?\\
162 - Bernadette: Well, let’s just say the next time you move a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge, make two trips. \\
163 - Howard: You’re sure you’re okay?\\
164 - Bernadette: Yeah, it’s just a precaution. If there was a problem, I’d be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now. Sorry I messed up our date.\\
165 - Howard: Oh, don’t worry about it. I brought the date here. Guys, come on in.\\
166 - Bernadette: What’s all this?\\
167 - Howard: Well, tonight is the anniversary of our first date, and I wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you.\\
168 - Bernadette: Howie.\\
169 - Amy: Sheldon, get over here.\\
170 - Sheldon: She might be contagious. Don’t you think I’m having a rough enough day?\\
171 - Amy: Sheldon.\\
172 - Howard (singing): If I didn’t have you, life would be blue, I’d be Dr. Who without the TARDIS.\\
173 - Sheldon: Is it me, or does she not look so good?\\
174 - Amy: Shh.\\
175 - Howard: A candle without a wick, a Watson without a Crick, I’d be one of my outfits without a dick-ie. I’d be cheese without the mac, Jobs without the Wozniak, I’d be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it much harder to crack. I’d be an atom without a bomb, a dot without the com, and I’d probably still live with my mom.\\
176 - All: And he’d probably still live with his mom.\\
177 - Howard: Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You supported all my dreams and all my hopes. You’re like uranium-235 and I’m uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. I couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you Bernadette.\\
178 - Bernadette: Oh, Howie.\\
179 - Howard: If I didn’t have you life would be dreary, I’d be string theory without any string. I’d be binary code without a one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. I’d be Firefly, Buffy and Avengers without Joss Whedon. I’d speak a lot more Klingon, Heghlu’meH QaQ jajvam. \\
180 - All: And he’d definitely still live with his mom.\\
181 - Howard: Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You’re my best friend and my lover. We’re like changing electric and magnetic fields. You can’t have one without the other. I couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you, Bernadette.\\
182 - All: Oh, we couldn’t have imagined how good our lives would get from the moment that we met you, Bernadette.\\
183 - Bernadette: Howie, that was amazing. Look, I’m shaking.\\
184 - Sheldon: She’s sick, I knew it. Bye.\\
185 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. \\
186 - Leonard: I have to say, this is the best Top Ramen you’ve ever made.\\
187 - Penny: I discovered a secret ingredient. The flavour packet. That sucker is well named. All right, lover boy, get ready, ’cause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way.\\
188 - Leonard: Stop it, you’re gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident.\\
189 - Penny: Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, you’ll see why.\\
190 - Leonard: Oh, rose petals.\\
191 - Penny: Yes. The most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers.\\
192 - Leonard: You made the bed? You really are pulling out all the stops.\\
193 - Penny: Okay, I gave this a lot of thought, and I finally found something to show you how much I love you.\\
194 - Leonard: Oh, wow.\\
195 - Penny: It’s a first edition of Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. I remember it was your favourite book growing up.\\
196 - Leonard: This is great. It, thank you, it’s, so much.\\
197 - Penny: What?\\
198 - Leonard: Nothing. I love it.\\
199 - Penny: No. Something’s going on. What’s wrong with it? I remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition.\\
200 - Leonard: It’s true, I did. I did say that. When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it.\\
201 - Penny: Oh, my God, I am the worst.\\
202 - Leonard: No, no, it’s okay. It’s really thoughtful.\\
203 - Penny: No, it’s not. I mean, what’s thoughtful is everything you do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, here’s the, the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because. Here’s the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it.\\
204 - Leonard: I can’t believe you saved all this stuff.\\
205 - Penny: Of course I did. It’s you.\\
206 - Leonard: Come here.\\
207 - Penny: Oh.\\
208 - Leonard: Is that a pregnancy test?\\
209 - Penny: Oh, yeah, just the first one. I didn’t save them all.\\
210 - Scene: The apartment.\\
211 - Sheldon: I can’t believe I read this table wrong. I blame you.\\
212 - Amy: Me? What did I do?\\
213 - Sheldon: You distract me. I’ve been distracted since the moment I met you. \\
214 - Amy: Sorry.\\
215 - Sheldon: Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do.\\
216 - Amy: Oh, Sheldon.\\
217 - Sheldon (not in Amy’s daydream, now in the Cheesecake Factory): Amy? Amy? Did you hear what I said?\\
218 - Amy: Can’t talk, in the zone.
\subsection {Episode 07: The Proton Displacement}
1 - Scene: A supermarket\\
2 - Amy: I’ve never seen him this happy before.\\
3 - Leonard: That’s because you’ve never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.\\
4 - Sheldon: Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I can’t wait until I get a rash. \\
5 - Leonard: Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength. I guess they really do read their mail.\\
6 - Sheldon: Hey, isn’t that Professor Proton?\\
7 - Leonard: Oh, yeah.\\
8 - Sheldon: Look at him, just standing in line like he wasn’t moderately famous 30 years ago. Let’s go say hello.\\
9 - Leonard: Oh, maybe we shouldn’t bother him.\\
10 - Sheldon: I’m not going to bother him, I’m going to talk to him.\\
11 - Leonard: He thinks there’s a difference.\\
12 - Sheldon: Arthur? Arthur, it’s me, Sheldon Cooper. You may not remember because of your advanced age.\\
13 - Arthur: Trust me, I, I remember.\\
14 - Sheldon: This is my girlfriend, Amy. Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children.\\
15 - Arthur: Hold, hold, hold on. You, you have a girlfriend?\\
16 - Amy: Yes, and I’ve heard so much about you. Hey look, we’re wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. I can’t believe I dress like a celebrity.\\
17 - Arthur: Oh, okay, I get it now.\\
18 - Leonard: Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter.\\
19 - Arthur: Oh, oh, right, I remember your, your girlfriend. Is, is she, is she here?\\
20 - Leonard: No, she’s not.\\
21 - Sheldon: So, what prescription are you getting filled?\\
22 - Leonard: Sheldon.\\
23 - Sheldon: No. Wait, I want to guess. Don’t tell me.\\
24 - Arthur: I wasn’t going to tell you.\\
25 - Amy: Sheldon, come on.\\
26 - Sheldon: No, no, no. I’m really good at this. All right, give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?\\
27 - Arthur: Well, given my age, that’s more than just a lucky guess.\\
28 - Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, let’s go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that.\\
29 - Sheldon: But I’m hanging out with my friend, and we’re having fun. Look how happy he is.\\
30 - Credits sequence. \\
31 - The cafeteria.\\
32 - Howard: Bernie’s having a girls’ night on Friday at our place. You want to do something?\\
33 - Raj: Actually, I’m busy.\\
34 - Howard: Doing what?\\
35 - Raj: There’s a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave…\\
36 - Howard: You’re going to girls’ night.\\
37 - Raj: Yeah.\\
38 - Howard: You know they’re making jewellery right?\\
39 - Raj: You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts.\\
40 - Leonard: What’s up?\\
41 - Howard: Not his testosterone levels.\\
42 - Raj: Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.\\
43 - Howard: How is that possible?\\
44 - Leonard: Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton.\\
45 - Sheldon: Goody. What’s it say?\\
46 - Leonard: He’s working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if I’d take a look at it.\\
47 - Sheldon: That’s strange. That he would come to you for that and not me. Oh, I got two emails from him. Do you have Leonard’s email address? And. Never mind, I found it. I can’t believe he picked you over me.\\
48 - Howard: You don’t want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasn’t done any real science in decades.\\
49 - Raj: Yeah, it’s nothing to cry about.\\
50 - Sheldon: Sheldon Cooper does not cry.\\
51 - Howard: It’s true, you’d rust.\\
52 - Scene: The apartment.\\
53 - Sheldon: And to think I idolized that man. And why? At the end of the day he’s just another Hollywood phony.\\
54 - Amy: Is it really worth getting upset about?\\
55 - Sheldon: Yeah, they say don’t meet your heroes. Don’t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you’ll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk.\\
56 - Amy: Come on, he’s a retired kids show host.\\
57 - Sheldon: That’s even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.\\
58 - Amy: Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn’t want you to read his paper?\\
59 - Sheldon: Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills.\\
60 - Amy: Maybe he found you, um, a bit much.\\
61 - Sheldon: That’s kind of a stretch. Look, when it comes to social skills, I’ve mastered the big three. There’s the coy smile. There’s the friendly chuckle. There’s the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last one’s tricky, I’m still working on it.\\
62 - Amy: From what I saw the other day, I could understand why he and some people might find you…\\
63 - Sheldon: What?\\
64 - Amy: Doesn’t matter.\\
65 - Sheldon: No, go ahead, say it. I know what it is. I’ve heard it my whole life. The word’s annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying.\\
66 - Amy: Sheldon.\\
67 - Sheldon: Oh, it won’t hurt my feelings. Go ahead, Amy, say I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. Yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? Look, you know you want to say it, say it. Say I’m annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say it. Amy, say it. Well, she can’t stand it when I’m right.\\
68 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment. \\
69 - Amy: This is fun. I’m going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn’t have a list of medications I’m allergic to.\\
70 - Raj: Penny, how’s it going over there?\\
71 - Penny: Good, I’m just having little trouble with the glue.\\
72 - Amy: How do you not know how to use glue? Did you ditch pre-school?\\
73 - Penny: Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader.\\
74 - Howard: Hello, everyone.\\
75 - Raj: Okay, let me have it. Let’s hear all the Raj is a girl jokes.\\
76 - Howard: Nope. Bernadette told me it isn’t nice and I’m not allowed.\\
77 - Raj: Thank you.\\
78 - Howard: So I won’t be making fun of you, or the things you like, or the fact that you just want to have fu-un.\\
79 - Bernadette: Howie, stop. Come on, look at what I’m making.\\
80 - Howard: Oh, that’s actually pretty nice.\\
81 - Amy: I’m making a bracelet.\\
82 - Penny: Yeah, I’m just making a mess.\\
83 - Howard: You know, instead of beads and glue, you guys can use my soldering iron. You’d be able to make much cooler stuff.\\
84 - Raj: Oh, I think we’re doing just fine, thank you.\\
85 - Amy: Actually, I’d kind of like to try that.\\
86 - Bernadette: Me, too.\\
87 - Howard: Be right back.\\
88 - Penny: When did I have pistachios?\\
89 - Scene: Professor Proton’s house. \\
90 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Arthur. (Knock, knock, knock) Arthur. (Knock, knock, knock) Arthur. Door knocker. That’s TV money.\\
91 - Arthur: Sheldon, what are you doing here?\\
92 - Sheldon: I’m sorry, did I wake you?\\
93 - Arthur: Of course you woke me, it’s seven thirty.\\
94 - Sheldon: Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn’t on this map of Hollywood stars.\\
95 - Arthur: What do you want, Sheldon?\\
96 - Sheldon: It’s been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.\\
97 - Arthur: She sounds like a keeper.\\
98 - Sheldon: Anyway, I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry.\\
99 - Arthur: All right, apology accepted. Have a nice night.\\
100 - Sheldon: No, no, now that we’ve cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you.\\
101 - Arthur: Sheldon, in a couple hours I have to get up, pee and then wander around the house.\\
102 - Sheldon: Well, then, I’ll make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said it’s promising and he’s going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you’re a washed-up has-been. Or dead.\\
103 - Arthur: I should be so lucky.\\
104 - Sheldon: So, uh, what do you say?\\
105 - Arthur: You know, if it’s all the same with you, I, I think I’ll, I’ll stick with Leonard.\\
106 - Sheldon: It’s because I’m annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying. \\
107 - Arthur: Good night.\\
108 - Sheldon: Say it. Arthur, say it. Say I’m annoying. Say it. Say it. I’m annoying. Say it. \\
109 - Arthur: You’re annoying.\\
110 - Sheldon: Well, that really hurt. \\
111 - Scene: Leonard’s laboratory. \\
112 - Leonard: If you would have told me when I was a kid that someday I would be doing science next to Professor Proton, I would not have believed you.\\
113 - Arthur: If someone had told me that people would still call me Professor Proton when I was 83 years old, I never would have quit smoking.\\
114 - Leonard: I’m sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I’m just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, it’s really interesting.\\
115 - Sheldon: Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur. What an odd coincidence that you’re both here.\\
116 - Leonard: Why is it odd?\\
117 - Sheldon: Because as it just so happens, I’m also spending the day with a beloved children’s television science personality. Isn’t that right, new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model.\\
118 - Bill Nye: Wow, Arthur Jeffries. It’s an honour to meet you. My show never would have happened without yours.\\
119 - Arthur: That’s what I told my lawyers.\\
120 - Leonard: Mr. Nye, hello. I’m sorry he got you involved in this nonsense.\\
121 - Bill: He said I’d be speaking to a class.\\
122 - Sheldon: No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson. Now let’s go.\\
123 - Bill: What are you guys working on?\\
124 - Leonard: Oh, uh, we’re making nano vacuum tubes.\\
125 - Bill: Oh, that’s interesting.\\
126 - Arthur: Haven’t you stolen enough from me? Back off, bow tie.\\
127 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. \\
128 - Penny: Hey, guys, what do you think?\\
129 - Amy: Wow, Penny, good job.\\
130 - Penny: Thanks. Target, four ninety-nine. I’m getting a drink.\\
131 - Amy: What are you working on?\\
132 - Raj: Ah, I’m making a necklace for my mom. \\
133 - Amy: That’s sweet.\\
134 - Raj: Yeah, she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch, so I wanted to do something to let her know I was thinking about her.\\
135 - Penny: What’s going on with them?\\
136 - Raj: They’re just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says it’s because the sound of my mom’s voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.\\
137 - Bernadette: Hi.\\
138 - Penny: Hey, guys.\\
139 - Amy: Hello.\\
140 - Howard: Look who’s here to put the Jew in jewellery night.\\
141 - Bernadette: Oh, sure, so it’s fine when you say it.\\
142 - Howard: Sorry we’re late. I wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.\\
143 - Raj: I didn’t know you were coming again.\\
144 - Howard: Well, last week was a blast. Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here. \\
145 - Penny (laughing): It was not funny.\\
146 - Amy: So, what tools did you bring?\\
147 - Howard: Everything we need to make jewellery moulds. Here’s some silver, a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down.\\
148 - Penny: Ooh, that looks like fun.\\
149 - Bernadette: Maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire.\\
150 - Howard: Okay, who’s up first?\\
151 - Amy: Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?\\
152 - Raj: No, thanks.\\
153 - Howard: I was gonna make a necklace for my mom, but unfortunately she doesn’t have a neck. She’s just chins and fat and feet.\\
154 - Scene: Leonard’s laboratory.\\
155 - Leonard: Okay, we’re almost ready to go. Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes.\\
156 - Arthur: This is so exciting, I, I feel like I’m 75 again.\\
157 - Leonard: Oh, God.\\
158 - Arthur: What, what is it?\\
159 - Leonard: Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.\\
160 - Arthur: Can, can I ask you a question?\\
161 - Leonard: Yeah, sure.\\
162 - Arthur: Why do you put up with Sheldon?\\
163 - Leonard: Oh, uh, you know, because we’re friends.\\
164 - Arthur: Why?\\
165 - Leonard: Wow, you ask really hard questions.\\
166 - Arthur: Yeah.\\
167 - Leonard: Look, I know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he’s not doing it on purpose. It’s just how he is. But he’s also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together.\\
168 - Arthur: You, you know you’re describing a dog.\\
169 - Leonard: He did bite me once. But in his defence, I came up behind him while he was eating, so…\\
170 - Arthur: Yeah, they, they hate that.\\
171 - Leonard: You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met. And he’s a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him, too.\\
172 - Arthur: Why, why is that?\\
173 - Leonard: Boy, you will not let this go, will you? Oh, jeez.\\
174 - Arthur: Another photo from Sheldon?\\
175 - Leonard: No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.\\
176 - Arthur: He probably stole his wallet, too.\\
177 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. \\
178 - Howard: You know, if you guys are interested, there’s a technique where I can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your DNA in it.\\
179 - Penny: Oh, that’s amazing,\\
180 - Howard: Yeah. See Bernie’s engagement ring? That came right off my mom’s back.\\
181 - Bernadette: He’s kidding. If that were true, it’d be so much bigger.\\
182 - Raj: My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.\\
183 - Howard: Whoa, where is that coming from?\\
184 - Raj: I’ll tell you where it’s coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls’ night and now you’re here ruining it for everyone.\\
185 - Penny: Raj, cool it, he’s gonna make us hair diamonds.\\
186 - Howard: How am I ruining anything? I’m just trying to help you make better jewellery.\\
187 - Raj: But this isn’t about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings.\\
188 - Howard: Since when can’t you open up with me?\\
189 - Raj: There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won’t make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch.\\
190 - Howard: Buddy, I was just joking around. \\
191 - Raj: Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt. \\
192 - Howard: You’re right. I didn’t realize I was making you feel that way. It was very brave of you to tell me.\\
193 - Raj: Thank you. It wasn’t easy.\\
194 - Amy: They’re gonna have s*x before Sheldon and I do, I know it.\\
195 - Scene: The apartment.\\
196 - Sheldon: Arthur?\\
197 - Arthur: Hi, Sheldon.\\
198 - Sheldon: I’m surprised to see you here.\\
199 - Arthur: Yeah, me, too. Somewhere around the third floor I began to see a, a white light.\\
200 - Sheldon: I’ll get Leonard.\\
201 - Arthur: No, no, no, I’m, I’m here, I’m here to see you.\\
202 - Sheldon: If you’re hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I can’t help you. I’ve been informed that he’s now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.\\
203 - Arthur: No, I, I, I was thinking, if it isn’t too much trouble, I’d like to get your opinion about my, my paper.\\
204 - Sheldon: Thank you. It would be an honour.\\
205 - Arthur: Oh. Uh, great.\\
206 - Sheldon: Actually, I don’t need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it.\\
207 - Arthur: And, what did you think?\\
208 - Sheldon: Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing. \\
209 - Arthur: Mmm. Thank you.\\
210 - Sheldon: Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired. \\
211 - Arthur: Oh, well, that, that means a lot to me.\\
212 - Sheldon: Can I invite you in for tea?\\
213 - Arthur: Uh, no, no. I, I really, I have, I have to run.\\
214 - Penny: Hey, Arthur. How are you?\\
215 - Arthur: Well, I guess one cup wouldn’t hurt.\\
216 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
217 - Howard: Oh, hey, buddy, what’s up?\\
218 - Raj: Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something.\\
219 - Howard: You didn’t have to do that.\\
220 - Raj: Well, it was fun. I used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. It’s a lightsabre belt buckle.\\
221 - Howard: Wow, this is so cool. Thanks.\\
222 - Raj: Oh gets better.\\
223 - Howard: Wow.\\
224 - Raj: And that’s not even the best part. See? I have one, too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want.\\
225 - Scene: The apartment.\\
226 - Sheldon: Yeah, and my eighth favourite episode of Professor Proton was Alka-Seltzer rocket. You said, plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is. Remember? Remember that? Remember?\\
227 - Leonard: He can’t help it. He can’t. He really can’t.\\
228 - Sheldon: Oh, wait here. I’ll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nye’s house. As long as I’m not within 500 feet of it.\\
229 - Arthur: So, you, uh, you have, you have any, single grandmothers?\\
230 - Penny: Sorry, they’re both married.\\
231 - Arthur: Good.\\
232 - Penny: Mmm.\\
233 - Arthur: Hap, hap, happily?
\subsection {Episode 08: The Itchy Brain Simulation}
1 - Scene: The apartment\\
2 - Penny: Hey, can I ask you a question?\\
3 - Leonard: Sure.\\
4 - Penny: You’ve had this dart board since I’ve known you, but I’ve never seen you play.\\
5 - Leonard: Oh, uh, we played, once. I broke a window.\\
6 - Penny: What window?\\
7 - Leonard: That one over there.\\
8 - Sheldon: Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?\\
9 - Leonard: Skee-Ball tickets?\\
10 - Sheldon: Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago? I finally decided what prize I want. Hurry up.\\
11 - Leonard: Uh, if I still have them, they’re probably in the junk box.\\
12 - Penny: Ooh, what are you gonna get?\\
13 - Sheldon: None of your business. But when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later, you are most welcome to sniff it.\\
14 - Leonard: Yup, oh, here you go.\\
15 - Sheldon: Oh, thank you. Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles.\\
16 - Leonard: Oh. I forgot about this. My aunt made it for me when I started college.\\
17 - Penny: Aw, did she hate you?\\
18 - Leonard: Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite.\\
19 - Sheldon: I seem to be a few tickets short. Are there more in the box?\\
20 - Leonard: Hmm, I think I got them all. Nope, they’re not in there.\\
21 - Sheldon: Well, you barely looked. Let me see.\\
22 - Leonard: No, no, no, I, I looked, and there’s, there’s, there’s no more tickets.\\
23 - Sheldon: Leonard, let me look in the box.\\
24 - Leonard: Okay, okay. I’m gonna show you what’s in the box. But just promise not to flip out.\\
25 - Sheldon: Why would I flip out? Is it a spider? It’s a spider.\\
26 - Penny: No, if it was a spider, Lenny would’ve flipped out.\\
27 - Leonard: Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card. But it’s been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?\\
28 - Sheldon: That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?\\
29 - Leonard: I’m sorry. I’ll, I’ll take care of it.\\
30 - Sheldon: Okay.\\
31 - Leonard: I mean it, I’m going to.\\
32 - Sheldon: I believe you.\\
33 - Leonard: And you’re going to stay calm?\\
34 - Sheldon: I said I would.\\
35 - Leonard: How about that? Sheldon’s being reasonable.\\
36 - Penny: Yeah, it’s freaking me out. I’m gonna go.\\
37 - Credits sequence.\\
38 - Scene: The apartment.\\
39 - Leonard: So, when you say you’re not going to freak out about the DVD, here’s what that means. Don’t fixate on it. Don’t wake me up in the middle of the night. Or nag me through the door while I’m on the toilet.\\
40 - Sheldon: Okay, first, talking to you while you’re on the toilet isn’t exactly a picnic for me either, okay? Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you. And second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. It’s, it’s like, a, an itch in my brain I can’t scratch.\\
41 - Leonard: When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?\\
42 - Sheldon: You wouldn’t make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.\\
43 - Leonard: Well, I don’t know how to do that.\\
44 - Sheldon: How about this? I promise I won’t pester you about the DVD. You can defecate in peace. That’s a win for both of us. But, until this matter is resolved, I would like you to wear this sweater. With nothing underneath it.\\
45 - Leonard: That’s stupid. Why?\\
46 - Sheldon: You say it’s itchy and uncomfortable. I say situations like this make me feel the same way. \\
47 - Leonard: I’m telling you, try the hanger.\\
48 - Sheldon: Put it on. Let’s share the experience.\\
49 - Leonard: You got it. If this sweater shuts you up, I’m gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD.\\
50 - Sheldon: Oh, did I forget to tell you? That store went out of business years ago.\\
51 - Leonard: Really?\\
52 - Sheldon: How those nipples feeling, chief?\\
53 - Scene: The cheesecake factory bar.\\
54 - Bernadette: Penny, can we please get our drinks?\\
55 - Penny: Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.\\
56 - Amy: At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery.\\
57 - Bernadette: Cool. At my lab, I performed ten laser capture micro-dissections.\\
58 - Penny: I scraped gum off the bottom of that table. Only ’cause my manager saw me put it there.\\
59 - Amy: Oh, my gosh. That’s the girl that broke Rajesh’s heart.\\
60 - Bernadette: That’s Lucy?\\
61 - Penny: I don’t know why but I always pictured her as Indian.\\
62 - Bernadette: I think that reason’s called racism.\\
63 - Penny: I’m gonna go talk to her.\\
64 - Bernadette: Why? What are you gonna say?\\
65 - Penny: I’m not gonna say anything. I just want to check her out. Because she hurt my friend. My Indian friend. Who’s racist now?\\
66 - Bernadette: You because you just called him your Indian friend.\\
67 - Penny: Yeah, well, you’re short.\\
68 - Amy: We’re never getting our drinks.\\
69 - Bernadette: No, but we knew that.\\
70 - Penny: Hey, can I start you off with something to drink?\\
71 - Lucy: Oh, water would be great.\\
72 - Penny: Okay. Um, you’re Lucy, right? I’m a friend of Raj Koothrappali’s. Actually Amy recognized you.\\
73 - Lucy: Wow. How’s he doing?\\
74 - Penny: Oh, you know, he’s good.\\
75 - Lucy: Great.\\
76 - Penny: Yeah, this is none of my business. But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?\\
77 - Lucy: Oh, I don’t know. I guess I thought it would be easier.\\
78 - Penny: Yeah, I get that. I’ll go get you your water. When you say easier, you mean easier for you, right? ‘Cause it certainly didn’t make it easier for him.\\
79 - Lucy: Any chance I can get a different waitress?\\
80 - Penny: I’m sorry, this is rude of me. I will go get that water. See, see, see, see. Just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?\\
81 - Lucy: I don’t know your e-mail.\\
82 - Penny: You know what the worst part is? You’re sitting here, perfectly happy and he’s at home, a blubbering mess.\\
83 - Lucy: Oh, I thought you said he was okay.\\
84 - Penny: Well, I also said I was getting you water, but look at me still standing here. You know, I may be a bad waitress, but you are a bad person. Now, you want to hear the specials?\\
85 - Scene: The apartment.\\
86 - Howard: So, you can never take it off?\\
87 - Leonard: No.\\
88 - Raj: Not even to sleep?\\
89 - Leonard: No.\\
90 - Howard: So, you’re just an idiot?\\
91 - Leonard: It’s called proving a point.\\
92 - Howard: Is the point that you’re an idiot?\\
93 - Sheldon: Gentlemen, please. Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. He can’t walk in my actual shoes. He has the feet of a toddler.\\
94 - Raj: So, how are you gonna return the DVD if the store went out of business?\\
95 - Leonard: Monday morning I’ll go downtown, look up the owner’s information and send him the DVD. Pay the late fee, and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. Ah!\\
96 - Howard: And the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know that only you can prevent forest fires.\\
97 - Raj: I don’t get it.\\
98 - Howard: You didn’t have Smokey the Bear in India?\\
99 - Raj: No. Oh, is he anything like, uh, Mun-Mun the Mongoose? He taught us not to play with cobras.\\
100 - Howard: You had to be taught not to play with cobras?\\
101 - Raj: You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?\\
102 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
103 - Penny: Hey, if you guys were hungry, why didn’t you order something at the restaurant?\\
104 - Bernadette: We did, you never brought it.\\
105 - Penny: Oh, that’s right. Nachos and a turkey club.\\
106 - Amy: Not even close.\\
107 - Penny: Well, I was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your, I want to say salmon.\\
108 - Amy: You want to say sorry.\\
109 - Bernadette: So, how are you gonna tell Raj abut what you did?\\
110 - Penny: What do you mean how? What’s the big deal?\\
111 - Amy: You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.\\
112 - Bernadette: Then you made her cry and leave.\\
113 - Penny: Okay, you guys are overreacting. Raj is gonna appreciate how I had his back.\\
114 - Scene: The same, later.\\
115 - Raj: What is wrong with you, Penny? You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy. Now she knows I’m a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure. (Phone text sound) It’s Lucy. She wants to meet for coffee. I love you, Penny.\\
116 - Scene: Sheldon’s office.\\
117 - Howard: Hey, what’re you working on?\\
118 - Sheldon: I’m thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.\\
119 - Howard: That’s a pretty cool idea.\\
120 - Sheldon: Yeah. It’s great you’re here. I’d love to get an engineer’s opinion.\\
121 - Howard: Sure.\\
122 - Sheldon: This chair is squeaky. Now, do I fix it or get a new one?\\
123 - Leonard: Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning, but I found the owner of the video store. And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool. Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to, so this issue is resolved. Ah! And I’d just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, I didn’t use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me.\\
124 - Howard: You know, you could reimburse the video store owner’s next of kin.\\
125 - Leonard: Or it’s resolved.\\
126 - Sheldon: Hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good.\\
127 - Howard: I believe this is yours.\\
128 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
129 - Raj: Can I ask you guys a question? So, I’m seeing Lucy tomorrow night, and I’ve never hung out with someone who broke up with me. How do you do it?\\
130 - Howard: You can’t let her know you’re hurting. You know, the key is confidence.\\
131 - Raj: Why is the key always confidence? How come it’s never love handles and flop sweat?\\
132 - Bernadette: If this girl hurt you so much, are you sure you want to see her again?\\
133 - Howard: Well, if I may, he has so little self-respect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection, she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to YouTube, and he’d still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride.\\
134 - Raj: He’s right. But in my defence, if we could survive that, we could survive anything.\\
135 - Bernadette: Well, if you’re sure you want to do this, it’s only coffee, just relax and see what happens.\\
136 - Raj: Well, can I say she looks nice?\\
137 - Bernadette: Sure.\\
138 - Raj: Can I tell her I miss her?\\
139 - Bernadette: Maybe, if she asks.\\
140 - Raj: Oh, can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?\\
141 - Bernadette: I’d save that for the second date.\\
142 - Raj: Good, good. ‘Cause no matter how hard I try, I cannot get the twins to look alike.\\
143 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
144 - Penny: What are you doing?\\
145 - Leonard: Oh, I’m just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon’s stupid face when he sees that I didn’t let this get to me.\\
146 - Penny: Sheldon’s not here. Why don’t you take the sweater off?\\
147 - Leonard: There’s a principle at stake.\\
148 - Penny: Which is?\\
149 - Leonard: Oh, I don’t know. Who cares? Look at me.\\
150 - Penny: Oh, my God! Is that sweater made of bees? Come on, take it off. I won’t tell.\\
151 - Leonard: No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins.\\
152 - Penny: Sweetie, every night you don’t kill him in his sleep, he wins.\\
153 - Leonard: No, it’s, it’s almost done. I just, I have to find the next of kin, and send ‘em the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft.\\
154 - Penny: Smile.\\
155 - Leonard: What is that? What is that for?\\
156 - Penny: So you can send it to Princeton and get your money back.\\
157 - Scene: The apartment.\\
158 - Amy: I must say, Sheldon, you’re handling this DVD business with an impressive amount of maturity.\\
159 - Sheldon: I don’t know why that surprises you. I’m a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.\\
160 - Amy: Is there some kind of new coping mechanism you’re employing?\\
161 - Sheldon: The more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?\\
162 - Amy: I’m gonna go with sad. So what’s the story with you and this DVD?\\
163 - Sheldon: There’s nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers.\\
164 - Amy: Seriously?\\
165 - Sheldon: Please. Ha-ha, Oh.\\
166 - Scene: A coffee shop.\\
167 - Lucy: Hi.\\
168 - Raj: Hello. Oh, it’s so good to see you.\\
169 - Lucy: You, too.\\
170 - Raj: Please, sit. I, uh, I got you a cappuccino. I remembered it was your favourite. I also got crumb cake, but I remembered it was my favourite and I ate it. Anyway, uh, how are you?\\
171 - Lucy: I’m pretty good. Listen, I just wanted to apologize for breaking up with you in an e-mail.\\
172 - Raj: Well, and I ate all the crumb cake. We both made mistakes.\\
173 - Lucy: Okay.\\
174 - Raj: I’m so happy you asked me here, and I hope we can hang out again sometime. You know, as friends, lovemaking partners, whatever.\\
175 - Lucy: Oh, uh, I’m kind of seeing someone.\\
176 - Raj: I think I know the answer to this, but just to be clear, it’s not me, right?\\
177 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. \\
178 - Raj: This is all your fault, I should’ve listened to Mun-Mun because I’ve been playing with a cobra and her name is Penny. Why are you so cruel? Do you enjoy my pain?\\
179 - Penny: There’s a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.\\
180 - Raj: I love you, Penny.\\
181 - Scene: The apartment.\\
182 - Sheldon: How is it I can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can’t figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?\\
183 - Amy: I think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?\\
184 - Sheldon: There’s probably a deep reason. Which I’d be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.\\
185 - Leonard: Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options. Video store owner, Nursis Manookian, has no next of kin.\\
186 - Sheldon: Well, you seem hot under the collar, or is that the sweater?\\
187 - Leonard: Oh, oh, no, no. It’s because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian, no one attended. Luckily, my trip wasn’t a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I’m not Armenian, so it probably won’t work. This is over, right?\\
188 - Sheldon: Oh, not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon.\\
189 - Leonard: Listen to me, Sheldon. I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie.\\
190 - Sheldon: You know, it might be fun. You love hummus.\\
191 - Leonard: Why isn’t this bothering you? Isn’t your brain getting itchy? This is on your card. This could be ruining your credit score. Why isn’t this making you crazy?\\
192 - Sheldon: Leonard, I have something to tell you, but I want you to promise not to flip out.\\
193 - Leonard: What?\\
194 - Sheldon: Seven years ago, I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it.\\
195 - Leonard: What?\\
196 - Sheldon: I was going to mention it at the time, but then I thought, some day, this might be a teachable moment.\\
197 - Leonard: Aaaah! I, you, how can, what!\\
198 - Amy: Sheldon, that was diabolical.\\
199 - Sheldon: I know. And it wasn’t easy. Do you have any idea what it’s like to wait for years and never know if you’re going to finally get satisfaction?\\
200 - Scene: A coffee shop.\\
201 - Raj: Wow. You’re even prettier than Penny said. I can’t believe a girl like you doesn’t have a boyfriend.\\
202 - Girl: Well, I don’t.\\
203 - Raj: I don’t believe you, you’re lying to me. \\
204 - Girl: What?\\
205 - Raj: Oh, it’s okay. I have no morals and I’m desperately lonely. I’ll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side.\\
206 - Scene: The cheesecake factory.\\
207 - Girl (to Penny): What is wrong with you?\\
208 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
209 - Penny (to Raj): What is wrong with you?\\
210 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
211 - Raj (to a mirror): What is wrong with you?
\subsection {Episode 09: The Thanksgiving Decoupling}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Leonard: The math is all there. It’s not real.\\
3 - Penny: Yes, it is.\\
4 - Sheldon: Yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn’t do it.\\
5 - Raj: It’s horrible. Why would you push a cow over? They’re sacred.\\
6 - Penny: Oh, stop it. I’ve seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers.\\
7 - Raj: Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.\\
8 - Penny: Look, I’m telling you I’ve done it, okay? I clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side.\\
9 - Leonard: Were you drunk?\\
10 - Penny: I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?\\
11 - Leonard: I think you’re the one who fell over.\\
12 - Penny: That would explain why the sky was also on its side.\\
13 - Howard: Hey.\\
14 - Penny: Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?\\
15 - Howard: Mmm. I’m gonna say not. That’s just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she’s snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she’s invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.\\
16 - Sheldon: Mmm. You know, I’ve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so I’d love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful.\\
17 - Howard: Come on, it’ll be fun.\\
18 - Penny: Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.\\
19 - Howard: Please? Bernadette’s bringing her dad ’cause her mom’s out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy.\\
20 - Sheldon: Oh, since you put it that way, I’d love to go, but that sounds even more awful.\\
21 - Leonard: It’d actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.\\
22 - Sheldon: Uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?\\
23 - Leonard: I want to go.\\
24 - Penny: Yeah, me, too.\\
25 - Raj: I’m in.\\
26 - Howard: Sheldon.\\
27 - Sheldon: Ugh, fine, I’ll go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined, and it’s on you.\\
28 - Credits sequence.\\
29 - Scene: The apartment.\\
30 - Sheldon: Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz’s house?\\
31 - Amy: We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.\\
32 - Sheldon: Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.\\
33 - Amy: Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz’s mom’s with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?\\
34 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
35 - Penny: Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas.\\
36 - Leonard: You did?\\
37 - Penny: Yeah, back when I was dating Zack. It was actually more fun than I thought. We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club.\\
38 - Leonard: Wait, you went to a chapel?\\
39 - Penny: Yeah. \\
40 - Leonard: Why? \\
41 - Penny: We had one of those silly fake weddings.\\
42 - Leonard: Penny, you know those are real, right?\\
43 - Penny: No, they’re not.\\
44 - Leonard: Yeah, they are.\\
45 - Penny: No, they’re not.\\
46 - Leonard: Yeah, they are.\\
47 - Sheldon: He’s right.\\
48 - Amy: They’re real.\\
49 - Penny: But it didn’t seem real.\\
50 - Sheldon: Let me ask you a question. At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?\\
51 - Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.\\
52 - Bernadette: Hi, Dad.\\
53 - Mike: Hi, honey.\\
54 - Bernadette: Oh, you brought beer for everybody.\\
55 - Mike: Uh, okay, yeah, it’s for everybody. I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home and watch the game.\\
56 - Bernadette: You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.\\
57 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, the medicine’s not working.\\
58 - Howard (off): You just took it. At least let it reach your first stomach. (entering) Hey, Mike. Let me help you out, there.\\
59 - Mike: Thanks. What’s wrong with your mom?\\
60 - Howard: Oh, her gout’s flaring up. Turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away.\\
61 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): How can one little toe hurt so bad? \\
62 - Howard: Maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn. She should quiet down soon. I gave her enough pain meds to choke a, well, her.\\
63 - Bernadette: I guess we’re gonna have to do all the cooking.\\
64 - Howard: I have a better idea.\\
65 - Bernadette: If you think you’re gonna make me do all this by myself, you’re crazy.\\
66 - Howard: I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.\\
67 - Bernadette: Oh, well, that’s a great idea.\\
68 - Scene: Leonard’s car. \\
69 - Amy: No traffic, we’re sailing.\\
70 - Sheldon: Yes. Like we’re on a ship. Coming from Africa to America.\\
71 - Amy: Sheldon, that’s completely inappropriate. You can’t keep comparing yourself to a slave.\\
72 - Sheldon: Yes, Miss Amy.\\
73 - Leonard: I can’t believe you’re married to that idiot.\\
74 - Penny: Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.\\
75 - Leonard: Well, a goof or not, you’re actually married. You need to get this taken care of.\\
76 - Penny: I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?\\
77 - Sheldon: Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonard’s proposed, he’s gotten a resounding no. Yeah, that’s just off the top of my head.\\
78 - Penny: So how do I undo this?\\
79 - Leonard: I’m hoping you can get an annulment. It’s just like it never happened.\\
80 - Penny: Great, well, what do I have to do?\\
81 - Amy: It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?\\
82 - Sheldon: Hah!Penny? Next.\\
83 - Amy: Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding?\\
84 - Penny: Want of understanding? What does that even mean?\\
85 - Amy: Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.\\
86 - Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s kitchen.\\
87 - Bernadette: Thanks for saving the day.\\
88 - Raj: Ah, no problem. It wouldn’t be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?\\
89 - Howard: Um, I don’t know. Probably in a wad in her cheek.\\
90 - Bernadette: I’ll help Raj in here. Why don’t you go keep my dad company?\\
91 - Howard: He doesn’t want me in there. I’m the creepy little guy who has s*x with his daughter.\\
92 - Bernadette: Don’t be silly, he loves you.\\
93 - Howard: Does he?\\
94 - Bernadette: Okay, he cares about you a lot.\\
95 - Howard: Really?\\
96 - Scene: The living room.\\
97 - Bernadette: I do crap for you all the time. Get out there.\\
98 - Howard: So your wife’s in Arizona with the grandkids?\\
99 - Mike: Uh-huh.\\
100 - Howard: You know, my mom’s been to Arizona. She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon. Long story short, they had to shoot it. ‘Cause she’s so fat. I’ll get the door while you finish laughing. Hey, guys.\\
101 - Amy: Happy Thanksgiving.\\
102 - Sheldon: It smells wonderful. Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? Because I, too, know…\\
103 - Amy: Sheldon.\\
104 - Penny: Here. Thank you for having us.\\
105 - Howard: What’s with you?\\
106 - Leonard: Oh, she’s mad at me because she just found out she’s married to Zack.\\
107 - Howard: Really? That dumb-ass she used to date? That’s hysterical.\\
108 - Penny: I can’t believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.\\
109 - Scene: The kitchen.\\
110 - Amy: You need any help?\\
111 - Raj: Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?\\
112 - Amy: Uh, sure.\\
113 - Raj: Great. That makes one of you. Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette, you’re on corn, gravy and yam detail. Amy, you’re on rolls, cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That’s right, I see you. Okay, if you have any questions, I’ll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key.\\
114 - Amy: Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?\\
115 - Together: What?\\
116 - Scene: The living room.\\
117 - Howard: You ever play football?\\
118 - Mike: A little in college. You?\\
119 - Howard: No. But I did get tackled in the hallway once. The whole school cheered.\\
120 - Leonard: Okay, I found the, uh, court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. I’ll print them when we get home.\\
121 - Penny: Fine.\\
122 - Leonard: And we can just put this whole thing behind us.\\
123 - Penny: Are you done?\\
124 - Leonard: What?\\
125 - Penny: Look, I get it, I screwed up. Is this all we’re gonna talk about the rest of the day?\\
126 - Leonard: Why are you mad at me? You’re the one that did the stupid thing. I’m just trying to fix it.\\
127 - Penny: Ugh, I need some air.\\
128 - Leonard: Wuh, Penny.\\
129 - Sheldon: I don’t know the first thing about women, but I would not follow her.\\
130 - Mike: Listen to Stretch.\\
131 - Leonard: How am I the bad guy? She’s the one who married someone else. I’m the victim.\\
132 - Howard: Sounds like Zack’s the victim. You’re sleeping with his wife.\\
133 - Mike: I’ve kept my marriage together for 35 years. Can I weigh in here?\\
134 - Leonard: Sure.\\
135 - Mike: I’m trying to watch the game. Shut up. Oh, how do you not make a first down there?\\
136 - Sheldon: They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.\\
137 - Mike: How the hell do you know that?\\
138 - Sheldon: My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework.\\
139 - Penny: Well, you’ll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack and he’s willing to sign the court papers. He’s on his way here now.\\
140 - Leonard: Wait, you invited him here?\\
141 - Penny: Yeah. \\
142 - Mike: I’m getting ready to weigh in again.\\
143 - Leonard: Come on.\\
144 - Mike: What do you think they ought to do now?\\
145 - Sheldon: I would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz.\\
146 - Howard: Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. Get it? ‘Cause it sounds like blintz.\\
147 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Did someone say blintz?\\
148 - Scene: The dining room.\\
149 - Leonard: I just don’t understand why you invited him here today.\\
150 - Penny: Because you wouldn’t shut up about it. When I called him, he had nothing to do, so I just thought it would…\\
151 - Raj: Hey, guys, I’m trying to cook in here.\\
152 - Penny: Oh, sorry. We’ll keep it down.\\
153 - Raj: No, no, speak up. I’m about to use the blender, and I don’t want to miss anything.\\
154 - Leonard: Well, you might have to cook for one more because she invited Zack.\\
155 - Bernadette: What?\\
156 - Amy: Ooh!\\
157 - Raj: My, my. The plot, like my gravy, thickens.\\
158 - Scene: The living room.\\
159 - Sheldon: I don’t care for your mother’s bathroom. There’s not an angle to do one’s business without a clown figurine staring at you.\\
160 - Howard: That’s why I sit.\\
161 - Mike: Yeah, that’s why. You remember the Thanksgiving game when it snowed in Dallas?\\
162 - Sheldon: 1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.\\
163 - Mike: I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.\\
164 - Sheldon: So was my dad. And then he did.\\
165 - Howard: Anyone need a beer?\\
166 - Mike: Yeah.\\
167 - Howard: Thank God.\\
168 - Mike: So, does your dad still live in Texas?\\
169 - Sheldon: No. He died when I was 14.\\
170 - Mike: I’m sorry to hear that.\\
171 - Sheldon: So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried.\\
172 - Howard: Here you go.\\
173 - Mike: Oh, thanks. So, if your dad died when you were 14, you were never old enough to have a beer with the man.\\
174 - Sheldon: No, sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but I was 11 and my mom said no.\\
175 - Mike: Well, you’re having one with me.\\
176 - Sheldon: All right.\\
177 - Mike: To your dad.\\
178 - Howard: I never had a beer with my dad, either.\\
179 - Sheldon: Do you mind? We’re having a moment here.\\
180 - Scene: The kitchen.\\
181 - Amy: I can’t believe Penny’s married to Zack.\\
182 - Raj: Wonder what she saw in that guy.\\
183 - Bernadette: I don’t know. He’s sweet, he’s tall, handsome. \\
184 - Amy: Broad shoulders, good hair.\\
185 - Raj: Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.\\
186 - Bernadette: How’s it going out there?\\
187 - Howard: Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.\\
188 - Amy: I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when he’s not looking.\\
189 - Bernadette: What are they doing?\\
190 - Howard: They’re drinking beer and watching football. \\
191 - Bernadette: So why don’t you do that with them?\\
192 - Howard: They don’t want me.\\
193 - Bernadette: What do you mean?\\
194 - Howard: Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isn’t alive any more, and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about how sad I was when my dad abandoned…\\
195 - Amy: Zack’s here!\\
196 - Raj: Stir the gravy. \\
197 - Bernadette: Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are. I’ll be back in like five, ten minutes.\\
198 - Scene: The dining room.\\
199 - Leonard: Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.\\
200 - Zack: It’s all right. I didn’t have anything going on. Plus, Penny told me we’re married, and Thanksgiving’s a time to be with family.\\
201 - Penny: Yeah, okay, great. Can we just get this over with?\\
202 - Leonard: Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. On Monday, we’ll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over.\\
203 - Penny: Okay.\\
204 - Zack: I don’t know if I want to sign it.\\
205 - Raj, Bernadette and Amy: Ooh.\\
206 - Leonard: Why won’t you sign it?\\
207 - Zack: I just think splitting up can be rough on kids.\\
208 - Penny: We don’t have any kids.\\
209 - Zack: Are you sure? ‘Cause you didn’t know we were married until this morning.\\
210 - Penny: Okay, look, Zack, come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator.\\
211 - Zack: Of course it was an impersonator. We could never afford a real Elvis.\\
212 - Leonard: You married him instead of me? Good call. Sign the papers.\\
213 - Penny: Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this, whenever I mess up, you’re right there to make me feel even worse about it.\\
214 - Leonard: That is not true.\\
215 - Penny: Yeah, we could’ve waited till Monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over.\\
216 - Leonard: You’re the one who invited him here.\\
217 - Penny: Oh, there you go again, just another mistake you’re throwing in my face.\\
218 - Zack: Not cool, bro. I’m starting to think you’re not the kind of guy I want dating my wife.\\
219 - Leonard: Yeah, well, she’s not gonna be your wife for long.\\
220 - Zack: Oh, no. Are you dying?\\
221 - Penny: I’m about to. Sign the paper.\\
222 - Zack: Know what they say, happy wife, happy life. Let’s eat.\\
223 - Scene: The living room.\\
224 - Sheldon (burping): Two, three, eight, four, six. (Normal) That’s all I can do without throwing up.\\
225 - Mike: That is not what I expected when you said you were gonna burp pie.\\
226 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Did somebody say pie?\\
227 - Mike: I don’t know what’s scarier, the bathroom clowns or the woman that put them there.\\
228 - Sheldon: All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And there’s the clown that came out of her. I really didn’t want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I’ve had in a long time.\\
229 - Mike: Me, too.\\
230 - Bernadette: Hey. Howie says you’ve been making fun of him all day. Now, both of you apologize right now.\\
231 - Sheldon: She’s so tiny. It’s funny when she’s mad.\\
232 - Amy: All right, mister, I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology.\\
233 - Sheldon: Perhaps you’re right. I’m sorry for my behaviour. I’ve had alcohol, and it’s caused me to be inappropriate.\\
234 - Bernadette: It’s okay.\\
235 - Howard: Don’t worry about it.\\
236 - Amy: Thank you.\\
237 - Sheldon: Ain’t she great? \\
238 - Mike: Mmm.\\
239 - Amy: Sheldon.\\
240 - Sheldon: Now, how’s about you get us a couple of beers?\\
241 - Scene: The dining room.\\
242 - Bernadette: Thanks again for cooking.\\
243 - Amy: Yeah, everything was delicious.\\
244 - Raj: Well, I couldn’t have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.\\
245 - Mike: Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside and throw around the old pigskin?\\
246 - Sheldon: This is a Jewish house. I don’t think they have pigskin.\\
247 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Did someone say pigskin?\\
248 - Penny: Hey, I’m sorry about today. And I promise, next time I get married, it won’t be a joke. It’ll be for love. Or money.\\
249 - Leonard: I’m sorry, too.\\
250 - Zack: Don’t be. It’s my fault. I was a terrible husband. I was never around.\\
251 - Mike: I know I’m hard on you, but you’re not the worst son-in-law in the world.\\
252 - Howard: Mike, that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me.\\
253 - Mike: Well, I’m drunk.\\
254 - Sheldon: I just vomited on a lot of clowns.
\subsection {Episode 10: The Discovery Dissipation}
1 - Scene: A radio studio.\\
2 - Ira Flatow: This is Science Friday. I’m Ira Flatow. My guest today is responsible for the discovery of the first stable super-heavy element. Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\\
3 - Sheldon: Thank you. Uh, the university made me come here. I didn’t want to. Uh, big fan of the show.\\
4 - Ira: So, I understand that you actually discovered this element by mistake.\\
5 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
6 - Ira: And some people in the science community are calling it The Wonder Blunder.\\
7 - Sheldon: Who? Give me their names. I bet it’s Wolowitz.\\
8 - Ira: It’s just such a fascinating story. Your calculations are way off, but they find the element anyway. It’s like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure.\\
9 - Sheldon: Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?\\
10 - Ira: That’s interesting, but this could be taking you down the path toward a Nobel Prize. And in chemistry, no less. And wouldn’t that be unusual? Because you’re a physicist.\\
11 - Sheldon: Yes, yes, I’d be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry. Everyone laugh at the circus freak. You know, I don’t need to sit here and take this, Flatow. It is because of bullies like you, every day more and more Americans are making the switch to television.\\
12 - Credits sequence.\\
13 - Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is on the phone.\\
14 - Sheldon: President Seibert, I don’t know why you’re yelling. You’re the one who made me go on the radio. I was expecting a professional science interview, not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock. Well, if the university needs money so badly, perhaps you should start a swear jar. Whoa, that one’s worth a dollar.\\
15 - Amy: I know you don’t like it, but every time you do an interview, it raises the profile of the university. That translates to funding.\\
16 - Sheldon: Yeah, well, I’m not just some trained monkey dancing for coins.\\
17 - Leonard: Of course you’re not. People love trained monkeys.\\
18 - Penny: How can you not be happy? You’re tall, thin and famous. Oh, my God, I’m jealous of Sheldon.\\
19 - Sheldon: Look, you’re gonna be doing this stuff for a while. You’re just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.\\
20 - Sheldon: But none of you know what this is like. Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.\\
21 - Penny: Mmm, you clearly haven’t been with me at Mardi Gras.\\
22 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
23 - Bernadette: Want to pause the video game and help me clean up?\\
24 - Howard: I am cleaning up. Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.\\
25 - Bernadette: Come on, it’s your friend who’s coming to stay here.\\
26 - Howard: Raj grew up in India. Trust me, he’s seen worse.\\
27 - Bernadette: Howie. \\
28 - Howard: I promise I’ll help out the rest of the week.\\
29 - Bernadette: The rest of the week? You said it was just gonna be a night or two.\\
30 - Howard: Yeah, but if I told you a week, would you have said yes?\\
31 - Bernadette: No.\\
32 - Howard: Then you left me no choice.\\
33 - Bernadette: I love Raj, but that’s a long time for a house guest.\\
34 - Howard: I know, but they’re tenting his building. He can’t find a hotel he likes that allows dogs.\\
35 - Bernadette: He’s bringing Cinnamon?\\
36 - Howard: For a whole week, the nerve of some people.\\
37 - Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom. Sheldon is playing with his train set.\\
38 - Sheldon: Here comes the Embarrassment Express. With stops at Fraudville, Wonder Blunderberg, and Kansas City. Because it’s a hub.\\
39 - Amy: Sheldon, can I come in?\\
40 - Sheldon: Do you have cookies?\\
41 - Amy: No.\\
42 - Sheldon: Good. I don’t deserve cookies. Come in. Wil?\\
43 - Wil Wheaton: Hey, Sheldon. It’s been a while.\\
44 - Sheldon: Why are you here?\\
45 - Wil: Amy said you were having a rough time, and I thought maybe we could talk. Is that okay?\\
46 - Sheldon: Certainly. Although, right now, I’m having a rough time because there’s three people in my room, and it’s starting to feel like a discotheque.\\
47 - Amy: Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did.\\
48 - Wil: Yeah, I know a little something about that.\\
49 - Sheldon: Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad.\\
50 - Wil: I remember why it’s been a while. Sheldon, I was actually talking about when I was a kid on Star Trek.\\
51 - Sheldon: How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldn’t relate to that?\\
52 - Wil: Well, not everybody felt that way. A lot of people really hated the character, and some of them hated me because of it. I would do interviews, and people would be mean to me.\\
53 - Sheldon: That just happened to me. Next time you’re stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.\\
54 - Amy: Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things.\\
55 - Wil: Yeah, I’m an author now, I do public speaking, and I have my own Web series about board games.\\
56 - Amy: Uh, we’re trying to cheer him up, so… \\
57 - Wil: I’m just saying that there was a time when I thought I would never get out of Wesley Crusher’s shadow. But now, it’s just one small part of a pretty great life, and it’s a part that I’m happy is there.\\
58 - Sheldon: I do see what you’re saying. That helps.\\
59 - Wil: Good.\\
60 - Sheldon: Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?\\
61 - Wil: Sure.\\
62 - Amy: Okay.\\
63 - Sheldon: Oh, great, now, I work the controls, I say all aboard. You sit quietly and watch.\\
64 - Wil:Can I blow the whistle?\\
65 - Sheldon: You should probably go.\\
66 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
67 - Howard: You’re gonna brush your teeth on my couch?\\
68 - Raj: No, I’m gonna brush Cinnamon’s teeth.\\
69 - Howard: Why bother? She spends half the time licking her butt.\\
70 - Raj: And the other half licking my face. That’s why I’m brushing her teeth.\\
71 - Bernadette: Hey, guys. Sorry I’m so late. Did you already have dinner?\\
72 - Howard: No, we were waiting for you.\\
73 - Bernadette: Aw, that’s so sweet.\\
74 - Howard: Yeah. So what do you feel like making?\\
75 - Raj: Howard, the poor thing just got home from work. Let me get you a glass of wine. I’ll cook dinner.\\
76 - Bermadette: Oh, Raj, you’re our guest.\\
77 - Raj: Don’t be silly. Sit. You look like you’ve had a long day.\\
78 - Howard: No, she always looks like that. Because she married an idiot.\\
79 - Bernadette: Thank you, Raj.\\
80 - Raj: Please, this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. Now, tell us all about your day.\\
81 - Bernadette: Okay, um, well, first, I was late to a meeting ’cause I was stuck in traffic.\\
82 - Howard: Well, I keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone.\\
83 - Raj: Hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans, did I tell you how to fix it? No. I said, aw, that must hurt, and I rubbed your belly.\\
84 - Howard: I thought of you the whole time.\\
85 - Raj: All I’m saying is there’s a time to just listen. \\
86 - Bernadette: Thank you.\\
87 - Raj: There’s also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. And it’s when you’re ten.\\
88 - Scene: The apartment.\\
89 - Sheldon: Hello, President Siebert. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery. Oh, no, no, no, no. No need to thank mNo, thank my friend, Wil Wheaton. For your information, I have nine friends, hmm? Ten if we include you. Nine it is. Ah, it’s ten. I’ll count Wolowitz. Hello, friend Leonard.\\
90 - Leonard: Hey, you’re in a good mood.\\
91 - Sheldon: I’m in a great mood.\\
92 - Leonard: Well, you’re about to be in an even better one. I didn’t want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, I’ve been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist.\\
93 - Sheldon: Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it.\\
94 - Leonard: Yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results.\\
95 - Sheldon: Really?\\
96 - Leonard: Yes. Do you know what that means? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.\\
97 - Sheldon: So no more interviews?\\
98 - Leonard: No, it’s all over.\\
99 - Sheldon: I can’t believe it.\\
100 - Leonard: Well, you’re welcome.\\
101 - Sheldon: You robbed me of my greatest achievement.\\
102 - Leonard: What?\\
103 - Sheldon: I’m back down to nine friends. Make it eight, I’m sick of Wolowitz, too.\\
104 - Leonard: I, I don’t understand. All you’ve done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy.\\
105 - Sheldon: By taking away my only claim to fame? Well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends.\\
106 - Leonard: Oh, there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters don’t even live near each other.\\
107 - Sheldon: That’s what makes their friendship unlikely,\\
108 - Penny: Hey, what’s with all the yelling?\\
109 - Sheldon: Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.\\
110 - Penny: Oh, that’s great. You must be thrilled, \\
111 - Sheldon: That’s it, I’m down to seven friends.\\
112 - Penny: He’s counting hobbits and superheroes, right?\\
113 - Sheldon: When I thought the element was real, I didn’t want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist, I want it more than anything in the world.\\
114 - Leonard: The, the element never existed. I didn’t take it away, science took it away. Be mad at science.\\
115 - Sheldon: Don’t you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh, good, I’m back up to eight.\\
116 - Leonard: Will you tell him he’s out of his mind.\\
117 - Penny: Actually, I get what he’s saying.\\
118 - Sheldon: Oh, yes, nine. Welcome back, buddy.\\
119 - Penny: It’s like if you’re dating someone you’re not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever.\\
120 - Sheldon: I have no idea what she’s talking about, but we’re ganging up on you so I agree.\\
121 - Leonard: Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I don’t publish it, it’s just a matter of time before someone else does.\\
122 - Sheldon: No, no, of course you have to publish. That’s your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice.\\
123 - Leonard: Fine, I’ll publish.\\
124 - Sheldon: Can you believe this guy?\\
125 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
126 - Bernadette: Aw! Raj did the dishes.\\
127 - Howard: How do you know I didn’t do them?\\
128 - Bernadette: Because once, when all the knives were dirty, you cut a bagel with your keys.\\
129 - Raj: Good morning, everybody. I picked up coffee while I was out. Bernadette, here’s your soy peppermint mocha.\\
130 - Bernadette: Aw, you didn’t have to do that.\\
131 - Raj: Oh, my pleasure, and don’t worry about your presentation today. You’re gonna be great.\\
132 - Howard: Yeah, you’re gonna knock it out of the park.\\
133 - Bernadette: What presentation do I have today?\\
134 - Howard: Just go.\\
135 - Raj: He loves you.\\
136 - Howard: What are you doing? Are you trying to make me look bad?\\
137 - Raj: I’m just being a good house guest.\\
138 - Howard: No, you’re being a better husband than I am. Doing the dishes, getting coffee, knowing about her life, who does that?\\
139 - Raj: Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.\\
140 - Howard: I don’t want coffee.\\
141 - Raj: That’s why I got you hot chocolate.\\
142 - Howard: Give me that. Just stop showing me up.\\
143 - Raj: Howard, listen to me. You’re a great husband. Yes, your listening skills could use some work. But it’s amazing how far you’ve come given that you’re an only child raised by an over-protective mom.\\
144 - Howard: Um, is this getting weird?\\
145 - Raj: Hang on.\\
146 - Howard: So, yes.\\
147 - Scene: Sheldon’s office.\\
148 - Leonard: Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I, I posted my findings.\\
149 - Sheldon: I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.\\
150 - Leonard: These things happen all the time, Sheldon.\\
151 - Sheldon: Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.\\
152 - Barry: Thew he is. It’s my favowite superhewo, the Wetwactor.\\
153 - Leonard: Come on, don’t give him a hard time.\\
154 - Barry: I’m sowwy, Cooper. I wetwact it. By the way, Hofstadter, nice job dispwoving the Chinese team.\\
155 - Leonard: It’s not a big deal.\\
156 - Barry: It’s a huge deal. Cooper, maybe physics just isn’t your thing. Have you ever considered a caweer in wetail? That way you could take things back for a wiving.\\
157 - Leonard: Okay, Barry, that’s enough.\\
158 - Sheldon: No, no, no, that’s okay. I can fight my own battles. Isn’t that right, Bawwy.\\
159 - Barry: Is? Is that a wefewence to my speech impediment? That’s pwetty hurtful. I, I can’t contwol it.\\
160 - Sheldon: You’re right, That was uncalled for. I take it back.\\
161 - Barry: Of course you do. Because you’re the Wetwactor.\\
162 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
163 - Bernadette: Raj, this dinner was amazing. If you’re here much longer, I’m gonna have to buy bigger clothes.\\
164 - Raj: Nonsense. You need a little fattening up. You’ve been looking too skinny lately.\\
165 - Bernadette: Aw. Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?\\
166 - Howard: What are you talking about? Remember last week, when I asked you if you were wearing Spanx and you weren’t? How’s that different?\\
167 - Bernadette: Maybe you could try being more thoughtful, like your friend Raj.\\
168 - Howard: Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj. \\
169 - Bernadette: Oh, really?\\
170 - Howard: Yeah, yeah. He packed me a lunch this morning. And there was a note inside that said go get ‘em.\\
171 - Bernadette: Like I don’t do enough around here. Now I need to pack your lunch? And by the way, why do you need a note telling you to go get ‘em? You’re a grown man, you should know to go get ‘em.\\
172 - Howard: I do know to go get ‘em, but sometimes it’s nice to have emotional support when I’m going and getting them.\\
173 - Raj: Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves? Let’s just, you know, all calm down and take a step back.\\
174 - Bernadette: This is stupid. Why are we fighting?\\
175 - Howard: I don’t know. I guess I was just feeling like I’m a lousy husband.\\
176 - Bernadette: You’re not a lousy husband. You’re a great husband. I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.\\
177 - Howard: Are you kidding? You’re the best. I know what the problem is. It’s him.\\
178 - Raj: Oh, what did I do?\\
179 - Howard: You made us feel like we’re not trying hard enough.\\
180 - Bernadette: Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage till you showed up.\\
181 - Raj: Look, I’m sorry you’re upset with me, but I just have to say it’s nice to see the two of you on the same page.\\
182 - Howard: Oh, it does feel good to have you backing me up for once.\\
183 - Bernadette: I back you up all the time.\\
184 - Howard: That is not… he’s doing it again. \\
185 - Bernadette: What is wrong with you?\\
186 - Scene: The apartment.\\
187 - Leonard: I can’t believe they kicked you out. \\
188 - Raj: I can’t believe they’re still married. Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon’s toothbrush at Howard’s. I guess you’re sharing with Daddy again. \\
189 - Penny: Bark once if you need me to call PETA.\\
190 - Sheldon: What’s that animal doing in our apartment?\\
191 - Leonard: Oh, relax, she’s in her crate. She can’t get out.\\
192 - Sheldon: I have two words for you, Jurassic Park. This day just keeps getting worse and worse.\\
193 - Penny: You know, if it makes you feel any better…\\
194 - Sheldon: It probably won’t.\\
195 - Penny: You’re probably right.\\
196 - Amy: Sheldon, it’s a beautiful night. Why don’t you and I go for a nice walk together?\\
197 - Sheldon: Oh, everything is just s*x with you isn’t it?\\
198 - Raj: Sheldon, I think you might find the support you’re looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take. She can only be there for you as much as you are for her.\\
199 - Amy: Thank you, Rajesh.\\
200 - Raj: And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon, instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms.\\
201 - Amy: You should probably go.\\
202 - Scene: The radio studio.\\
203 - Ira: I’m Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday. I’d like to welcome back Dr. Sheldon Cooper, who thought he had discovered a new super-heavy element only to have it disproved by my next guest, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. Welcome to Science< Friday, gentlemen.\\
204 - Leonard: Thanks.\\
205 - Sheldon: Thank you. Ira, if I may, I’d like to apologize for my behaviour last week.\\
206 - Ira: It’s all right.\\
207 - Sheldon: Now, isn’t there something you’d like to say to me?\\
208 - Ira: No. Now, Dr. Hofstadter. Can you walk us through the process you used to disprove his theory?\\
209 - Leonard: Well…\\
210 - Sheldon: I believe I can answer that.\\
211 - Leonard: He asked me.\\
212 - Sheldon: Fine.\\
213 - Leonard: As I was saying…\\
214 - Sheldon: You’re telling it wrong. Ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named…\\
215 - Leonard: Sheldon.\\
216 - Sheldon: That’s right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbour’s dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. Which, sadly, he couldn’t build because Santa wouldn’t bring him enriched uranium.\\
217 - Ira: You know, I’d really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter, if it’s okay with you.\\
218 - Sheldon: What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?\\
219 - Ira: Actually, I didn’t invite you. You came in, you took a seat, and I’m not comfortable with confrontation.\\
220 - Leonard: Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.\\
221 - Sheldon: Well, that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio.\\
222 - Penny (listening in her apartment): You know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game.\\
223 - Amy: A little early for alcohol, isn’t it?\\
224 - Sheldon: You know, I don’t just say smart things about science. I also yodel. (Does)\\
225 - Amy: I’ll get the vodka.
\subsection {Episode 11: The Cooper Extraction}
1 - Scene: The apartment. Penny and Amy are playing a ski-ing game.\\
2 - Penny: Wow, you’re really good at this.\\
3 - Amy: Well, I have an extremely low centre of gravity. I’m like a pyramid.\\
4 - Penny: How you doing over there?\\
5 - Leonard: Oh, I hope it’s just a sprain. I cannot walk into that E.R. with another video game injury.\\
6 - Penny: Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?\\
7 - Sheldon: Oh, I would, but I’m on my way out.\\
8 - Leonard: Where?\\
9 - Sheldon: Texas.\\
10 - Amy: Right now? Why?\\
11 - Leonard: Is someone sick?\\
12 - Sheldon: Yes. My sister’s uterus came down with a baby.\\
13 - Penny: Oh, she’s pregnant? That’s great. You’re gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon.\\
14 - Sheldon: No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.\\
15 - Amy: How come you never said she was pregnant?\\
16 - Sheldon: Well, I never told you about my brother’s kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my family’s genitals?\\
17 - Leonard: Well, congrats, and it’s nice you’re gonna be there for your sister.\\
18 - Sheldon: Yes. I’m filling in for her husband who’s recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident. Lucky duck.\\
19 - Penny: Wow, so, how long will you be gone?\\
20 - Sheldon: Well, she’s due tomorrow. Although it did take her six years to finish high school, so who knows?\\
21 - Amy: Can I give you a ride to the airport?\\
22 - Sheldon: Oh, no, thank you, I don’t want to be an inconvenience. Chop-chop, Leonard. We leave in ten minutes.\\
23 - Credits sequence.\\
24 - Scene: The apartment.\\
25 - Leonard: All right, here’s the deal. Sheldon is gone, so the tree decorating rules are out the window.\\
26 - Penny: Yeah, which means we don’t have to use his ridiculous ornament-spacing template.\\
27 - Leonard: And I’m happy to report its kickstarter campaign is holding strong at zero dollars.\\
28 - Penny: Ah.\\
29 - Raj: Wait, so Star Wars and Star Trek characters can go on the same branch?\\
30 - Leonard: I know, it’s crazy. Welcome to the Thunderdome, people. (All whoop)\\
31 - Howard: I’ve never done this before. It’s kind of fun.\\
32 - Raj: Yeah, if your mom could see her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now, she’d have a heart attack.\\
33 - Bernadette: Good idea, I’ll take a picture.\\
34 - Penny: Honey, I’m a little strapped for cash this year, so for Christmas I was thinking of giving you this.\\
35 - Leonard: I love it.\\
36 - Penny: Okay.\\
37 - Leonard: But it is what you got me last year.\\
38 - Penny: Yeah.\\
39 - Leonard: And last night.\\
40 - Stuart: Hello.\\
41 - Various: Hey, Hi, Stuart. etc\\
42 - Stuart: Oh, good, I’m glad you guys didn’t wait for me to start. Although you said seven and it’s, it’s seven, but that’s fine.\\
43 - Amy (ringing from tablet): Oh, it’s probably Sheldon. Hi, Sheldon. Everybody’s here, say hi.\\
44 - Penny: Hi. \\
45 - Leonard: Hey, buddy.\\
46 - Raj: Hey.\\
47 - Howard: Howdy.\\
48 - Bernadette: Hi.\\
49 - Stuart: Hello.\\
50 - Sheldon: The second I go out of town you throw a Christmas party without me? \\
51 - Amy: Yeah, kinda.\\
52 - Sheldon: That’s so thoughtful. You guys are the best.\\
53 - Penny: Hey, how’s your sister?\\
54 - Sheldon: <i>She went into labor an hour ago.\\
55 - Amy: That’s wonderful. So you’re at the hospital?\\
56 - Sheldon: No, she chose to have a home birth because she wants to live in the Stone Age and a cave wasn’t available.\\
57 - Raj: You know, many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm, comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones.\\
58 - Sheldon: And turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic Slip ‘n Slide.\\
59 - Mrs Cooper (off): Shelly, come on. Your sister’s fully dilated and she wants a nice family picture before there’s blood everywhere.\\
60 - Sheldon: Oh, boy. I picked the wrong day to wear my good robot T-shirt.\\
61 - Raj: If you were having Sheldon’s baby would you really want him in the room?\\
62 - Penny: Yeah, if he’s in the room when they’re making the baby, I’ll give you ten dollars.\\
63 - Bernadette: Hey, I brought over It’s a Wonderful Life if you guys want to watch it later.\\
64 - Amy: Oh, I love that movie.\\
65 - Raj: I’ve never seen it.\\
66 - Stuart: Me neither.\\
67 - Amy: It’s great. It’s Christmastime and Jimmy Stewart’s really depressed and he’s gonna jump off a bridge and kill himself.\\
68 - Stuart: Don’t need to see it. Living it.\\
69 - Bernadette: But then he gets to see what the world would be like if he’d never been born.\\
70 - Penny: Hey, you ever imagine what that would be like? Not being born?\\
71 - Leonard: (Knock, knock, knock) What do you think? (Knock, knock, knock) What do you think? (Knock, knock, knock) What do you think?\\
72 - Amy: You make jokes about Sheldon, but if it weren’t for him, I don’t think any of us would be sitting in this room right now.\\
73 - Howard: Really? Sheldon not being here is the main reason I’m in this room.\\
74 - Amy: It’s true. None of you would know me. You wouldn’t know Bernadette. You wouldn’t be dating Penny.\\
75 - Leonard: You don’t know that. I’ve been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years. I could have picked her up. (General laughter) \\
76 - Penny: Oh, you weren’t joking.\\
77 - Leonard: No.\\
78 - Penny: Okay, sweetie, let me tell you exactly how that would have gone down.\\
79 - Fantasy sequence in Cheesecake Factory.\\
80 - Leonard: I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna ask her out.\\
81 - Howard: I’m gonna squirt chocolate milk out of my nipples. Sorry, I thought we’re saying things that are never gonna happen.\\
82 - Raj: Maybe this time he’s going to do it.\\
83 - Howard: Hope you’re thirsty, here it comes.\\
84 - Leonard: Watch me.\\
85 - Penny: Hey, you guys ready to order or you need a few minutes?\\
86 - Leonard: I, uh, ah, um, I…\\
87 - Penny: A few minutes it is.\\
88 - Raj: You didn’t ask her out, but that was a lot of sounds.\\
89 - Leonard: You guys are making me nervous.\\
90 - Howard: Fine, then go talk to her on your own.\\
91 - Leonard: I will. Excuse me.\\
92 - Penny: Yeah?\\
93 - Leonard: Hi, uh, um, I’m Leonard?\\
94 - Penny: Really? You don’t sound so sure.\\
95 - Leonard: No, I am he. Uh, any, anyway, um, there’s been something I’ve wanted to ask you for a long time. Um.\\
96 - Penny: What’s that?\\
97 - Leonard: Eh, uh, well, I was wondering, if you’re not too busy, um, uh, if, if you’d be interested in telling me where the restroom is?\\
98 - Penny: I think you’re too late.\\
99 - End fantasy sequence\\
100 - Leonard: Come on, I would not have peed my pants.\\
101 - Howard: She nailed it.\\
102 - Raj: Sounds about right.\\
103 - Leonard: But, you forget, I did ask you out in real life.\\
104 - Amy: Which couldn’t have happened if you didn’t live across the hall from her, which couldn’t have happened without Sheldon. Same goes with you guys. If Leonard wasn’t with Penny, she never would have set you up.\\
105 - Howard: Doesn’t matter. Bernadette still would’ve been working at The Cheesecake Factory, and I still would’ve been working this beefcake factory. You would’ve been all over me.\\
106 - Bernadette: Well…\\
107 - Fantasy sequence in the Cheesecake Factory.\\
108 - Bernadette: Hey, Penny, can I take that table?\\
109 - Penny: Sure, why?\\
110 - Bernadette: The one in the turtleneck is cute.\\

112 - Howard: Mm-hmm, chug-a-chug-a, yum, yum.\\

114 - Bernadette: Never mind.\\
115 - End fantasy sequence.\\
116 - Raj: Oh, man, that is so us.\\
117 - Leonard: You know, maybe you and I wouldn’t be together, but you wouldn’t have done so great yourself.\\
118 - Penny: Why? \\
119 - Leonard: Because I know exactly the kind of guy you would’ve ended up with.\\
120 - Fantasy sequence in Penny’s apartment.\\

129 - Penny: Me, too.\\
130 - End fantasy sequence.\\
131 - Leonard: The end.\\
132 - Amy (Tablet ringing): Hi, Sheldon. Everything okay?\\
133 - Sheldon: No, it’s not. I’ve seen things. Lady things.\\
134 - Amy: Listen to me. That is not the way they usually look.\\
135 - Sheldon: Doesn’t matter. This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. It’s some kind of dirty magic show.\\
136 - Mrs Cooper (off): Sheldon Lee Cooper. You get back in this room right now. And bring a mop.\\
137 - Sheldon: Did you hear that? A mop. I have two PhDs yet somehow I’m the janitor of my sister’s birth canal.\\
138 - Leonard: Hey, Sheldon sent us all an e-mail. Happy holidays from Texas. And there’s pictures. Aah! Don’t open them. Do not open them.\\
139 - Penny: Oh, come on. Childbirth is a natural, beautiful, uuurgh, it’s like someone sawed a cow in half.\\
140 - Raj: My father’s a gynaecologist, I think I can handle it. And, now, I’m gay.\\
141 - Bernadette: You know, I was thinking. Without Sheldon, most of us would have never met, but Penny would still live across from him. \\
142 - Amy: And with Leonard out of the picture, we all know what that would mean.\\
143 - Penny: We do?\\
144 - Fantasy sequence in the Laundry Room.\\
145 - Penny: Hey, Sheldon.\\
146 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
147 - Penny: Doing laundry?\\
148 - Sheldon: Of course I’m doing laundry. Saturday night is laundry night, and I’m in a laundry room, so, I believe your inference is justified.\\
149 - Penny: Oh, my inference is justified. Sheldon, you are so funny. Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too, because these clothes are so dirty. Almost as dirty as the dirty girl who’s wearing them.\\
150 - End fantasy sequence.\\
151 - Penny: Okay, that’s enough.\\
152 - Leonard: Disagree.\\
153 - Raj: Keep going. \\
154 - Howard: More.\\
155 - Fantasy sequence. \\
156 - Penny: So, what do you think?\\
157 - Sheldon: A tad asymmetrical, but nothing to be concerned about.\\
158 - Penny: Please, Sheldon. I need you.\\
159 - Sheldon: To what?\\
160 - Penny: To take me.\\
161 - Sheldon: I’m not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt.\\
162 - Penny: Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here.\\
163 - Sheldon: Penny, for the thousandth time, I’m saving myself for someone special. Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud. \\
164 - Penny: I think I know how to change your mind.\\
165 - End fantasy sequence.\\
166 - Leonard: That’s enough.\\
167 - Raj: Ew.\\
168 - Stuart: I was okay with it.\\
169 - Amy (tablet ringing): How’s it going, Sheldon?\\
170 - Sheldon: Actually, much better.\\
171 - Leonard: Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?\\
172 - Sheldon: I don’t know. I just got back. \\
173 - Amy: Where’d you go?\\
174 - Sheldon: My mother asked me to get some towels. I took advantage of the vague request and went to Bed, Bath & Beyond. (Scream from other room) Excuse me, I’m on the phone. So rude.\\
175 - Amy: Here’s another one. Penny, if it weren’t for Sheldon you never would have met comic book legend Stan Lee.\\
176 - Penny: Great.\\
177 - Raj: At least Leonard, Howard and I would have always been friends.\\
178 - Bernadette: Hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?\\
179 - Leonard: We talked about it, but Howard was in a pretty serious relationship with his mom.\\
180 - Howard: I lived with her to save money.\\
181 - Raj: Yeah, you didn’t have to buy groceries ’cause you were breast-feeding.\\
182 - Bernadette: Aw, so I guess if it weren’t for me, you’d still be living with her, huh?\\
183 - Howard: Not exactly.\\
184 - Penny: What do you mean, not exactly?\\
185 - Howard: Well, things would be a little different.\\
186 - Fantasy sequence in Mrs Wolowitz’s house.\\
187 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, where’s my lunch? I’m starving.\\
188 - Howard: I know you’re starving. The neighbours know you’re starving. There’s starving people in Africa who know you’re starving.\\
189 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): That’s it? There’s not enough food.\\
190 - Howard:Well, you cleaned out Earth. I don’t know what else to do.\\
191 - Bernadette: How is this any different?\\
192 - Howard: You didn’t let me finish. Here you go, Mother.\\
193 - Dead Mrs Wolowitz: You’re a good boy, Howard, such a good boy.\\
194 - End fantasy sequence.\\
195 - Amy: Wait, did she die or did you kill her?\\
196 - Howard: Eh, tomato, tomahto. The important thing is she’s dead.\\
197 - Bernadette: Hey, so how come you two didn’t move in together?\\
198 - Leonard: Oh, this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies’ man.\\
199 - Raj: Yeah, I was wrong. But I do think you and I would have had a great time.\\
200 - Fantasy scene in Raj’s apartment.\\
201 - Raj: Come on, Leonard, dinner.\\
202 - Fat Leonard: Coming.\\
203 - Leonard: Hang on. Why would I be fat?\\
204 - Raj: You’d have no girlfriend to see you naked, you’d try to fill the void with food, and I’m an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake.\\
205 - Leonard: Why can’t you be fat, too?\\
206 - Fat Leonard: What do you want to do for dessert?\\
207 - Fat Raj: I think there’s still half a cake from breakfast.\\
208 - Fat Leonard: No, there’s not.\\
209 - Fat Stuart: Hey, guys.\\
210 - Fat Leonard and Raj: Stuart!\\
211 - End fantasy sequence.\\
212 - Raj: What are you doing?\\
213 - Stuart: I just wanted to be in anyone’s story.\\
214 - Raj: Yeah, but why are you fat?\\
215 - Stuart: ‘Cause Leonard was fat.\\
216 - Penny: Amy, what about you? What do you think you’d be doing if you never met Sheldon?\\
217 - Amy: It’s hard to say, my life would be so different.\\
218 - Howard: You can say better. Sheldon can’t hear you.\\
219 - Amy: I don’t know.\\
220 - Fantasy sequence in Amy’s apartment.\\
221 - Amy: Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, there’s tears in the frosting, happy birthday to me. (Stuart honks a party hooter at her.)\\
222 - End fantasy sequence.\\
223 - Stuart: I’ll stop now.\\
224 - Amy (tablet ringing): How’s it going, Sheldon?\\
225 - Sheldon: That’s it. The baby’s here. It’s a boy.\\
226 - Penny: Aw.\\
227 - Amy: Yay.\\
228 - Raj: Congrats.\\
229 - Sheldon: Oh, thank you. I wasn’t sure I was gonna to make it. But my mother gave me some ice chips, my sister told me to breathe, and I just thought to myself, Sheldon, if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie, you can make it through this.\\
230 - Leonard: Well, good for you, buddy. We’ll let you get back in there.\\
231 - Sheldon: Oh no, no, I’m not going back in there. That baby is so irritating. He has literally been crying his entire life.\\
232 - Howard: Aw, he’s already taking after Uncle Shelly.\\
233 - Amy: Come on, Sheldon, you should go.\\
234 - Sheldon: Why?\\
235 - Amy: Well, you always complain that you never had an intelligent role model growing up, and now you can be one for your nephew.\\
236 - Sheldon: Ugh, all right, I’ll go. But from what I’ve seen, his attention span is as limited as his bladder control.\\
237 - Bernadette: You actually got him to do it.\\
238 - Rajj: Yeah, you keep saying how much Sheldon has affected all of us, but you’ve clearly had an impact on him.\\
239 - Amy: If that were true, I wouldn’t still be living alone. Well, not exactly alone. I do have a 50 pound sack of rice with one of Sheldon’s T-shirts on it.\\
240 - Leonard: I’m telling you, Sheldon cares for you more than you think.\\
241 - Amy: I wish I could believe you. I also wish there wasn’t a mouse living in Rice Sheldon.\\
242 - Leonard: Hang on, I’m gonna give you a little early Christmas present. I’m gonna show you something, but if you ever told Sheldon he’d probably never speak to me again. So, if you want to tell him, that’s fine. Look.\\
243 - Amy: I don’t understand.\\
244 - Leonard: He made you his screensaver.\\
245 - Amy: Oh. Wow. I had no idea. He is so into me. Wait, wait, where’d I go?\\
246 - Leonard: Oh, well, it’s you, Swamp Thing, Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man, but, look, you’re in the mix.\\
247 - Amy: I am in the mix. And I’m the hottest one.\\
248 - Penny: Who’s that?\\
249 - Leonard: Oh, Madame Curie.\\
250 - Amy: That’s fine, she’s dead.\\
251 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
252 - Sheldon: You okay?\\
253 - Amy: Just really glad you’re back.\\
254 - Sheldon: Me, too. I got a lot of TV to catch up on.\\
255 - Amy: I missed you.\\
256 - Sheldon: To quote Han Solo, I know.\\
257 - Amy: Did you miss me?\\
258 - Sheldon: I would’ve preferred to have you there with me.\\
259 - Amy: Oh.\\
260 - Sheldon: Or instead of me.\\
261 - Amy: Did you hold the baby?\\
262 - Sheldon: I did. \\
263 - Amy: And? How did it make you feel?\\
264 - Sheldon: Looking into the blank, innocent eyes of a creature that couldn’t begin to comprehend anything I was saying? Basically just another day at the office.\\
265 - Fantasy sequence at the Cheesecake Factory.\\
266 - Fat Leonard: I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna ask her out.\\
267 - Howard: And chocolate milk is gonna squirt out of my nipples.\\
268 - Fat Raj: Put up or shut up. You make it, I’ll drink it.\\
269 - Penny: You guys need anything else?\\
270 - Fat Leonard: Uh, your phone number and one more cheesecake.\\
271 - Penny: I’m sorry, I have a boyfriend. In fact, there he is now. Ready to go, sweetheart?\\
272 - Stuart: Not until I get my kiss.
\subsection {Episode 12: The Hesitation Ramification}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Amy: This is nice, that we all get to eat together.\\
3 - Leonard: Absolutely.\\
4 - Amy: Hmm. Can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation?\\
5 - Sheldon: We can, but thanks to Steve Jobs, we don’t have to.\\
6 - Penny: Guys, guys, you’re never gonna believe this.\\
7 - Leonard: What happened?\\
8 - Penny: I just got a part on a TV show.\\
9 - Amy: Congratulations.\\
10 - Leonard: What? That’s great. Guys.\\
11 - Howard: Oh, yeah\\
12 - Sheldon: Yay, Penny.\\
13 - Amy: What’s the show?\\
14 - Penny: Um, NC… II… or, you know, NCSTD… I don’t know, it’s, it’s, you know, it’s the one with the letters and I’m gonna be on it!\\
15 - Leonard: That’s amazing.\\
16 - Penny: Yeah.\\
17 - Howard: What’s your part?\\
18 - Penny: Um, I play a customer in a diner and I flirt with Mark Harmon.\\
19 - Raj: Ooh, Mark Harmon, he’s a dreamboat.\\
20 - Leonard: So it, it’s just flirting?\\
21 - Penny: Well, yeah. Why?\\
22 - Leonard: Uh, no reason. I just think it’s sexier when things are left to the imagination.\\
23 - Amy: He’s wrong.\\
24 - Credits sequence.\\
25 - Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.\\
26 - Raj: So I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman’s phone number.\\
27 - Leonard: Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?\\
28 - Raj: I don’t see why not. \\
29 - Howard: If you’re really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom.\\
30 - Sheldon: Why is that funny? That’s just unhygienic.\\
31 - Leonard: It’s a joke.\\
32 - Sheldon: I don’t think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitz’s mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. See? The twist is that people don’t usually change. Well, they don’t.\\
33 - Penny: Hey, guys, don’t forget, my episode’s on TV tomorrow night.\\
34 - Howard: We’ll be there.\\
35 - Raj: Can we bring anything?\\
36 - Penny: Oh, that’s so sweet of you, but I was gonna steal food from here. You know, my treat.\\
37 - Sheldon: Wait, if Howard’s mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles. Because she’s obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles. Maybe I need to dumb these down for you. \\
38 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
39 - Sheldon: Leonard, do you think I’m funny?\\
40 - Leonard: No. Do you?\\
41 - Sheldon: I think I’m hysterical.\\
42 - Leonard: I take it back. That was funny.\\
43 - Sheldon: The philosopher Henri Bergson says it’s funny when a human being behaves like an object. \\
44 - Leonard: I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut.\\
45 - Sheldon: Oh, he didn’t perform stand-up comedy, he was a philosopher.\\
46 - Leonard: You know, I think we’re zeroing in on your problem.\\
47 - Sheldon: Perhaps I’ll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they’re German, ’cause that’s a tough crowd.\\
48 - Leonard: Are you set on people laughing with you? ‘Cause if you’re cool with at you…\\
49 - Sheldon: I don’t get it.\\
50 - Scene: Bernadette’s car.\\
51 - Bernadette: Raj, when you said you were gonna bring a date to watch Penny’s thing tonight, I didn’t think you meant Stuart.\\
52 - Howard: Really? I never for a second thought it’d be anything else.\\
53 - Raj: I almost met someone last night, but I blew it. I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself, but she was so cute I panicked and said, wouldn’t it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other’s butts?\\
54 - Bernadette: Well, Stuart’s cute in his own way.\\
55 - Stuart: When I was a baby, my mother called me her little possum.\\
56 - Raj: Are possums cute?\\
57 - Stuart: Not at all.\\
58 - Howard: If you’re so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people.\\
59 - Raj: You mean like fatties and uggos?\\
60 - Bernadette: Or maybe just stop talking.\\
61 - Howard: I’m serious. Go to the mall, talk to anybody, practice, that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl, it won’t be so scary.\\
62 - Bernadette: Or just keep dating the possum.\\
63 - Scene: The apartment.\\
64 - Voice on television: Parsa doesn’t have those kind of resources.\\
65 - Second voice: No, and that’s why he had Erin Pace rewire it…\\
66 - Leonard: I’m so proud of you.\\
67 - Penny: We haven’t even gotten to my scene yet.\\
68 - Leonard: I know, but you’re going to be a TV star and you haven’t left me yet. That takes guts.\\
69 - Sheldon: I don’t know about you, but I’m very uncomfortable with all this.\\
70 - Amy: Why?\\
71 - Sheldon: I’ve never seen this show before and now I’m starting with episode 246? It’s unnatural.\\
72 - Amy: Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.\\
73 - Sheldon: All right.\\
74 - Penny: Okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it.\\
75 - Man on TV: I guess it’s you and me, kid.\\
76 - Mark Harmon on TV: What are you doing?\\
77 - Woman on TV: I’m trying to make peace.\\
78 - Mark Harmon on TV: We’re good.\\
79 - Woman on TV: Good.\\
80 - Mark Harmon on TV: Really? Because…\\
81 - Penny: Are you kidding me?\\
82 - Leonard: What’s wrong?\\
83 - Penny: Well, the diner scene. Where’s my diner scene?\\
84 - Sheldon: Well, don’t ask me. Until I see the prequel, I’m lost.\\
85 - Penny: No, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon, but it’s gone.\\
86 - Bernadette: What happened?\\
87 - Penny: They must’ve cut it.\\
88 - Leonard: Oh, Penny, I’m, I’m sorry. \\
89 - Howard: That stinks.\\
90 - Raj: I’m sure you were great.\\
91 - Penny: This doesn’t make any sense. I mean, I, I thought I did a, a really good job, I… Excuse me.\\
92 - Sheldon: I’ve been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Let’s tickle some ribs.\\
93 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
94 - Penny (on phone): No, Dad, I don’t think they cut me out of the show because I was too pretty. No, I don’t need you to come out and kick Mark Harmon’s ass. Daddy, I gotta go. I love you. Bye.\\
95 - Leonard: How you doing?\\
96 - Penny: Ugh, this is such a disaster. My parents had all my relatives over. They got one of those six-foot sandwiches, and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he’s missing and the sandwich is missing, and they’re probably in Mexico by now. So humiliating.\\
97 - Leonard: You still got the part. That’s a huge accomplishment.\\
98 - Penny: Yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay? People were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. More auditions, more parts. Now none of that’s gonna happen.\\
99 - Leonard: Honey, you only had, like, three lines. That wasn’t gonna happen anyway.\\
100 - Penny: Unbelievable.\\
101 - Leonard: Oh, come on, no, that’s not what I meant.\\
102 - Penny: Then what did you mean?\\
103 - Leonard: I don’t, look, you know, words don’t always have to mean things.\\
104 - Penny: I think you meant that you don’t believe in me.\\
105 - Leonard: Nope. Uh, uh, I might not know what I meant, but I know that I didn’t mean that. Not this guy. Oh, no way.\\
106 - Penny: I want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion.\\
107 - Leonard: Right.\\
108 - Penny: Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?\\
109 - Leonard: Yes.\\
110 - Penny: So you think I’ll be on TV and in movies and win awards.\\
111 - Leonard: Honestly?\\
112 - Penny: Yes, honestly.\\
113 - Leonard: I don’t.\\
114 - Penny: How could you say that?\\
115 - Leonard: I don’t know, I got all confused when you said honestly.\\
116 - Penny: Oh.\\
117 - Leonard: Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? Of course I do. But isn’t Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? All right, look, we’ll come back to that.\\
118 - Penny: No, please. Don’t stop, go on. Tell me how I’m gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.\\
119 - Leonard: That is not what I said. Look, I think you’re really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you’re shooting for. I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one.\\
120 - Penny: Wow, thank you.\\
121 - Leonard: Should’ve let Sheldon come.\\
122 - Scene: The apartment.\\
123 - Sheldon: This is interesting. Apparently, a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise. \\
124 - Amy: Well, that makes sense. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on their…\\
125 - Sheldon: BRAIN LESIONS!\\
126 - Amy: Sheldon, you scared me. That wasn’t funny.\\
127 - Sheldon: Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.\\
128 - Amy: Okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. I mean, humour is a complex neurological… (Sheldon drops his trousers) Okay, that’s pretty good.\\
129 - Sheldon: Excellent.\\
130 - Scene: The mall.\\
131 - Stuart: How about her?\\
132 - Raj: No. No pretty girls. The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.\\
133 - Stuart: Fine. How about that old lady with the walker?\\
134 - Raj: That depends. On any level, do you think she’s hot?\\
135 - Stuart: We’ll find somebody else.\\
136 - Scene: The apartment. \\
137 - Sheldon: Kumquat?\\
138 - Amy: I guess.\\
139 - Sheldon: Ointment?\\
140 - Amy: Sure.\\
141 - Sheldon: Now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?\\
142 - Amy: I don’t think I want to go out with you anymore.\\
143 - Sheldon: Will you please stop joking around? I’m trying to figure this out.\\
144 - Amy: Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?\\
145 - Sheldon: All of them.\\
146 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. \\
147 - Penny: You didn’t get your part cut.\\
148 - Voice on TV: All right, baby, here’s the deal.\\
149 - Penny: And you didn’t get your part cut. Yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didn’t get your part cut!\\
150 - Leonard: Hey. Can we talk?\\
151 - Penny: We can, but the part of Penny might get cut.\\
152 - Leonard: That was really crappy of me. What you’re trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and I really do believe you could be one of them.\\
153 - Penny: Thank you.\\
154 - Leonard: And to show you how much I believe in you, I kind of got you an audition.\\
155 - Penny: Are you serious? For what?\\
156 - Leonard: The new Star Wars movie.\\
157 - Penny: What? How did you manage that?\\
158 - Leonard: There’s this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it.\\
159 - Penny: Come on Leonard, this is just a PR stunt.\\
160 - Leonard: So? Even if it is, you have a huge advantage because you’re an actual actress. Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. Wolowitz sent his in two days ago.\\
161 - Penny: Really, let it go.\\
162 - Leonard: Look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of The Force, he… wow, I can feel you hating me right now.\\
163 - Scene: The mall. \\
164 - Stuart: How about that lady in the sweat suit, speed-walking?\\
165 - Raj: Yeah, she seems friendly and easy to… never mind, she’s gone. You know, maybe talking to people is too hard.\\
166 - Stuart: We could go over to that department store, practice on the mannequins.\\
167 - Raj: I don’t know. They’re dressed very stylishly. They’re probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by, no matter who it is, they’re the one. We’re gonna die here.\\
168 - Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.\\
169 - Amy: Hello.\\
170 - Bernadette: Hey.\\
171 - Howard: Where’s Sheldon?\\
172 - Amy: He’s home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour.\\
173 - Bernadette: That’s interesting.\\
174 - Amy: It’s exhausting. Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy?\\
175 - Bernadette: If you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh.\\
176 - Howard: Fake a laugh? Do you ever do that with me?\\
177 - Bernadette: No, of course not.\\
178 - Howard: Well, I’d be able to tell anyway.\\
179 - Bernadette: I don’t think you would.\\
180 - Howard: Please, I’ve made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out. (Bernadette laughs uncontrollably) Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms.\\
181 - Scene: The apartment. \\
182 - Leonard (on phone): Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses? Really? How much for three?\\
183 - Penny: Hey.\\
184 - Leonard: Yeah, I’ll call you back.\\
185 - Penny: Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didn’t mean to call it idiotic.\\
186 - Leonard: Well, I don’t think you called it idiotic.\\
187 - Penny: Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself. I wasn’t mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart.\\
188 - Leonard: Come on. It’s okay.\\
189 - Penny: No, it’s not okay. Look at me, okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and I’m still doing it. I can’t quit, because guess what? I can’t do anything else. And I finally get my big break, and it goes away. I’m such a mess.\\
190 - Leonard: No, you’re not.\\
191 - Penny: Really? ‘Cause this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn’t the only one in there.\\
192 - Leonard: Okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback.\\
193 - Penny: No, it’s not, okay? I’ve been out here for, like, ten years. I’ve nothing to show for it.\\
194 - Leonard: Well, you have me.\\
195 - Penny: You’re right. I do have you. Mm. Let’s get married.\\
196 - Leonard: What?\\
197 - Penny: Ooh. Leonard Hofstadter, will you marry me?\\
198 - Leonard: Um…\\
199 - Penny: Did you seriously just say um?\\
200 - Leonard: Look, you know I love you but, but you’re, you’re drunk and sad and feeling lost.\\
201 - Penny: Okay, so, so you don’t want to marry me?\\
202 - Leonard: That is not what I said.\\
203 - Penny: No, forget it. I take it back. Offer’s off the table.\\
204 - Sheldon: Who’s in the mood to laugh?\\
205 - Leonard: Really not a good time.\\
206 - Sheldon: But I used science to construct the perfect joke.\\
207 - Penny: I’m gonna go.\\
208 - Leonard: Penny, don’t.\\
209 - Penny: No, no, I just need to be alone.\\
210 - Sheldon: So, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. Where are you going?\\
211 - Leonard: To my room.\\
212 - Sheldon: Should I follow you?\\
213 - Leonard: No.\\
214 - Sheldon: Leonard, wait.\\
215 - Leonard: What?\\
216 - Sheldon: I forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous.\\
217 - Scene: The mall.\\
218 - Stuart: How about those guys on that bench over there? They look pathetic. I bet we could talk to them.\\
219 - Raj: That’s a mirror.\\
220 - Stuart: Oh, yeah.\\
221 - Security Guard: Hey, fellas, mall’s closing.\\
222 - Raj: Sorry.\\
223 - Security Guard: Yeah. Good night.\\
224 - Raj: Uh, excuse me. \\
225 - Security Guard: Yeah?\\
226 - Raj: Uh, do, do you like being a mall security guard?\\
227 - Security Guard: It’s all right.\\
228 - Raj: Okay, nice talking to you.\\
229 - Stuart: Smooth.\\
230 - Scene: The apartment.\\
231 - Sheldon: Can’t sleep?\\
232 - Leonard: No.\\
233 - Sheldon: Would you like to talk about it?\\
234 - Leonard: Penny proposed, and I didn’t say yes.\\
235 - Sheldon: Why not?\\
236 - Leonard: That’s a good question.\\
237 - Sheldon: Does that mean the relationship is over?\\
238 - Leonard: I don’t know.\\
239 - Sheldon: Why don’t you ask her?\\
240 - Leonard: Because I’m afraid to know the answer.\\
241 - Sheldon: Well, I’m sorry.\\
242 - Leonard: That’s it? You’re not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?\\
243 - Sheldon: No. You’re my friend, and, I’m sorry.\\
244 - Leonard: Did you just put a kick me sign on my back?\\
245 - Sheldon: No. That wouldn’t be funny at all.\\
246 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.\\
247 - Howard: Star Wars audition, take one, starring Howard Joel Wolowitz, real-life astronaut. Vader is here, now, on this moon. I felt his presence. He’s come for me. He can feel when I’m near…\\
248 - Bernadette: How many times do I have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when it’s empty?\\
249 - Howard: I’m in the middle of something.\\
250 - Bernadette: So am I.
\subsection {Episode 13: The Occupation Recalibration}
1 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
2 - Sheldon: It’s an outrage.\\
3 - Leonard: I know.\\
4 - Sheldon: The university, they think they can do whatever they want. We just have to sit there and take it.\\
5 - Leonard: You need to let it go, Sheldon.\\
6 - Sheldon: You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get.\\
7 - Leonard: Oh, my God, they’re just making you use your vacation days.\\
8 - Sheldon: But I don’t want a vacation.\\
9 - Leonard: Okay, listen, I don’t mean to diminish what you’re going through, but I’m a little distracted right now.\\
10 - Sheldon: Oh, this again? So, Penny proposed, you didn’t say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?\\
11 - Leonard: It doesn’t.\\
12 - Sheldon: Thank you.\\
13 - Leonard: I’m gonna go talk to Penny. \\
14 - Sheldon: I’m going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over. (Leonard knocks three times) Penny. Sorry.\\
15 - Penny: Hi.\\
16 - Leonard: Hey.\\
17 - Penny: Look, I’m sorry I didn’t text you back. I just needed some time to think.\\
18 - Leonard: Okay.\\
19 - Penny: Yeah. Come in.\\
20 - Leonard: Look, if you want to break up, just say it.\\
21 - Penny: Leonard…\\
22 - Leonard: No, no, no, no. I take it back. Don’t say it. Just, just hate me, but stay with me. It worked for my parents.\\
23 - Penny: Listen, I don’t want to break up with you.\\
24 - Leonard: Oh. Oh, okay. Good, good. So, it’s cool if I cry a little?\\
25 - Penny: Yeah, I probably wouldn’t.\\
26 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
27 - Penny: Look, you did the right thing last night. I was a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere.\\
28 - Leonard: Look, I get it, and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do.\\
29 - Penny: Great, because I’ve been thinking, if I really want this acting thing to work, I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that, I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.\\
30 - Leonard: Wow. That, that’s a big step.\\
31 - Penny: I know.\\
32 - Leonard: So, well, before making any rash…\\
33 - Penny: I already quit.\\
34 - Leonard: And I support you.\\
35 - Credits sequence.\\
36 - Scene: The apartment.\\
37 - Sheldon: Come on, take me to work with you.\\
38 - Leonard: No. You’re on vacation.\\
39 - Sheldon: Please. What if there’s a big breakthrough in science today and I’m not there to see it?\\
40 - Leonard: Do you really think there’s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?\\
41 - Sheldon: No. I was just tricking you.\\
42 - Leonard: Bye.\\
43 - Sheldon: Leonard, wait. Take me with you.\\
44 - Leonard: No.\\
45 - Sheldon: Please.\\
46 - Leonard: No.\\
47 - Sheldon: Too bad. I’m coming with you.\\
48 - Leonard: Oh, Sheldon, stay.\\
49 - Sheldon: But.\\
50 - Leonard: I said stay. I’m going to work. Do not follow me. \\
51 - Scene: The comic book store.\\
52 - Bernadette: Hey Stuart.\\
53 - Stuart: Hey.\\
54 - Bernadette: Sorry. Did I startle you?\\
55 - Stuart: Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does. What can I do for you?\\
56 - Bernadette: Well, I need a little help. I accidentally destroyed one of Howard’s comic books this morning, and was hoping I could replace it.\\
57 - Stuart: Wow. What happened?\\
58 - Bernadette: Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.\\
59 - Stuart: Well, don’t let The Riddler know that. It’s a comic book joke. Or maybe it’s not.\\
60 - Bernadette: Do you have this one?\\
61 - Stuart: Uh, well, it’s, it’s pretty rare. Can you give me a few days to track it down?\\
62 - Bernadette: Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it before Howie comes home from work.\\
63 - Stuart: Oh. What’s the hurry?\\
64 - Bernadette: Well, he’s always saying I should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right.\\
65 - Stuart: Well, I’ll do what I can, but I can’t make any promises.\\
66 - Bernadette: You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company. If you can make this happen today, I can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants. \\
67 - Stuart: Really? Do you have any of these?\\
68 - Scene: Amy’s laboratory.\\
69 - Amy: Hello, Mr. Rat Brain. Not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now, are we?\\
70 - Howard: Anybody home?\\
71 - Amy: Hey, what brings you guys here?\\
72 - Raj: Well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you’d like to join.\\
73 - Amy: Why? Because Sheldon’s not here this week, and you don’t think I have any other options? I’m just kidding. I’ll get my purse.\\
74 - Bert: Hi, Amy. I, oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know you had any company.\\
75 - Amy: That’s okay. Uh, Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh. Guys, this is Bert.\\
76 - Howard: Hi.\\
77 - Raj: Hey. Good to see you.\\
78 - Bert: Anyway, I wanted to show you this tourmalinated quartzthat we got in the lab.\\
79 - Amy: This is so pretty. Bert works for the geology department.\\
80 - Bert: Yeah. You know what, uh, geologists and Bon Jovi have in common?\\
81 - Howard: You’re both into rock?\\
82 - Bert: Yeah. Well, see ya.\\
83 - Amy: Oh, you forgot your quartz.\\
84 - Bert: Oh, it’s okay. I want you to have it. Bye.\\
85 - Amy: He’s nice.\\
86 - Howard: Yeah, he’s nice because he likes you.\\
87 - Amy: What?! No, he doesn’t.\\
88 - Raj: He brought you a pretty rock.\\
89 - Amy: So? He does that every day. Oh.\\
90 - Howard: You know, if you’d rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, it’s totally okay.\\
91 - Amy: He’s not my boyfriend.\\
92 - Raj: Are you sure? He’s tall, pale and awkward. That sounds like your type.\\
93 - Amy: Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?\\
94 - Raj: Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.\\
95 - Amy: What do I do? I don’t want to hurt his feelings.\\
96 - Howard: Maybe the problem is he thinks you’re available. Does he know you’re dating Sheldon?\\
97 - Amy: I guess it hasn’t come up.\\
98 - Howard: There you go. \\
99 - Raj: And does Sheldon know you’re dating Sheldon?\\
100 - Amy: I’m sorry. Who are you dating?\\
101 - Raj: Yeah, knock it off, Howard.\\
102 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
103 - Penny: Oh. Hey, Sheldon.\\
104 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
105 - Penny: You okay?\\
106 - Sheldon: I’m on vacation. What do you think?\\
107 - Penny: Why are you sitting in the stairwell?\\
108 - Sheldon: Leonard told me to stay.\\
109 - Penny: Oh. Well, good boy.\\
110 - Sheldon: Where are you going?\\
111 - Penny: Oh, I have a ton of errands to run. I need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class.\\
112 - Sheldon: Well, have fun.\\
113 - Penny: Okay. You want to come with me?\\
114 - Sheldon: Really?\\
115 - Penny: Come on, boy. Come on. Let’s go. Let’s go. Get in the car. Come on.\\
116 - Scene: The comic book store.\\
117 - Stuart (on phone): All right, thanks a lot. They have one at Capital Comics.\\
118 - Bernadette: Oh, that’s great.\\
119 - Stuart: No, it’s not. I hate that place. Guy who owns it is a jerk. He’s always making me feel bad about myself.\\
120 - Bernadette: Oh, that’s terrible. What’s the address?\\
121 - Stuart: You know, why don’t I just take you there? That way, I can make sure he doesn’t rip you off.\\
122 - Bernadette: Oh, thanks, but I don’twant you to close up. I mean, won’t you lose business? Sorry. That was mean.\\
123 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
124 - Amy: Penny really quit The Cheesecake Factory?\\
125 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
126 - Howard: So, what is she doing today?\\
127 - Leonard: I don’t know. She already thinks I don’t support this, so if I call, it might look like I’m checking up on her.\\
128 - Raj: Well, do you support this?\\
129 - Leonard: Of course I do. She’s a great actress. I’m proud she’s taking this risk.\\
130 - Amy: That’s nice.\\
131 - Leonard: You bought that? Great. I got to call her before I forget how I said it. Hey.\\
132 - Penny: Hi. What’s up?\\
133 - Leonard: Oh, how’s it going? You taking Hollywood by storm?\\
134 - Penny: Actually, I’m at The Cheesecake Factory.\\
135 - Leonard: You got your job back. That is great news. I didn’t want to say anything, but you are making the right choice. To plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane.\\
136 - Penny: Yeah. I’m just returning my uniform.\\
137 - Leonard: And I support you.\\
138 - Scene: Penny’s car.\\
139 - Voice: Before we begin your guided meditation, close your eyes and picture yourself in a peaceful environment.\\
140 - Sheldon: Okay. I’m inside the CERN super collider.\\
141 - Voice: Now, take a deep, relaxing breath in through your nose. And let it out.\\
142 - Sheldon: Wow. Didn’t see that coming.\\
143 - Voice: In. \\
144 - Sheldon: Let me guess.\\
145 - Voice: And out.\\
146 - Sheldon: What was I gonna do? Two ins in a row? Where’s my lemonade?\\
147 - Penny: I didn’t get it.\\
148 - Sheldon: A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time.\\
149 - Penny: Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?\\
150 - Sheldon: Do you see me drinking lemonade?\\
151 - Penny: No. I’m serious.\\
152 - Sheldon: Why do you ask?\\
153 - Penny: Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?\\
154 - Sheldon: No, I don’t think you are. \\
155 - Penny: Really?\\
156 - Sheldon: The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didn’t take some other job in case it didn’t work out. Which wasn’t easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year.\\
157 - Penny: Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can’t Leonard understand it?\\
158 - Sheldon: Because he’s not like us, Penny. We’re dreamers.\\
159 - Penny: Yeah, I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car.\\
160 - Scene: Amy’s laboratory.\\
161 - Bert: Hey.\\
162 - Amy: Hello, Bert.\\
163 - Bert: So, anyway, there’s this big, uh, rock and mineral show next week in Santa Monica.\\
164 - Amy: Listen, um, Bert, before you say anything else, I, I have a boyfriend.\\
165 - Bert: Oh. This is awkward. You thought I was gonna ask you to go with me to the mineral show.\\
166 - Amy: Weren’t you?\\
167 - Bert: Yeah.\\
168 - Amy: That’s very nice of you, but I do have a boyfriend.\\
169 - Bert: That’s what you all say. You just don’t want to go out with me because I have an off-putting personality.\\
170 - Amy: No, that’s not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you.\\
171 - Bert: Don’t worry. I’m used to it. I mean, I’m big and weird and funny-looking and no one ever wants to do anything with me.\\
172 - Amy: Don’t say that. \\
173 - Bert: It’s okay. I know I’m a monster. \\
174 - Amy: No, Bert, come on. I’d love to go to the mineral show with you.\\
175 - Bert: Sweet. It’s a date.\\
176 - Amy: No, it’s not.\\
177 - Bert: Too late.\\
178 - Scene: Capital Comics.\\
179 - Bernadette: Wow.\\
180 - Stuart: Yeah. Haven’t seen this many people in my store since that Korean church bus crashed through my front window.\\
181 - Jesse: Hey, Stuart.\\
182 - Stuart: Jesse.\\
183 - Jesse: Haven’t seen you in forever. Look how grey you’ve gotten.\\
184 - Stuart: My hair’s exactly the same colour as always.\\
185 - Jesse: No, I was talking about your skin.\\
186 - Stuart: Look, uh, my friend here needs a comic book.\\
187 - Jesse: Ooh, and she went into your store by mistake. Good thing there was no one there to see you. What do you need? Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this. Right over here.\\
188 - Stuart: Even you, Sweatpants?\\
189 - Sweatpants: Free popcorn.\\
190 - Jesse: Can I offer you a coffee? Espresso? Latte?\\
191 - Bernadette: No, thanks.\\
192 - Jesse: How about you, Stu? Mocha? Scone? Directions to the nearest soup kitchen?\\
193 - Bernadette: Hey.\\
194 - Jesse: I’m just kidding. He knows where the soup kitchen is.\\
195 - Stuart: It’s on Merton Avenue.\\
196 - Bernadette: I don’t think I like the way you’re treating my friend.\\
197 - Jesse: Sorry. You want the book or not?\\
198 - Bernadette: Not from you. Let’s go, Stuart.\\
199 - Stuart: You know something, Jesse? You may have a successful business and the kind of pink complexion that comes with good nutrition, but I have something more important.\\
200 - Jesse: What’s that?\\
201 - Stuart: Friendship. Which I would trade in a heartbeat for all of this.\\
202 - Scene: Amy’s laboratory.\\
203 - Howard: The mineral and rock show? That would be awful even without Bert.\\
204 - Amy: So what am I supposed to do now?\\
205 - Raj: Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?\\
206 - Amy: This isn’t funny. I’m gonna have to tell him the truth, that even if I didn’t have a boyfriend, I wouldn’t be interested in him.\\
207 - Howard: Oh, I’ve heard those words so many times. From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel.\\
208 - Raj: Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury.\\
209 - Howard: Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino.\\
210 - Raj: Megan Pincus.\\
211 - Howard: Tammy Cho.\\
212 - Raj: Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks?\\
213 - Howard: Arlene Russel.\\
214 - Raj: Yes. Arlene. She wrote no way on both our cappuccinos.\\
215 - Howard: Poor Bert. That guy’s got a rough afternoon ahead of him.\\
216 - Amy: Well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn’t interested?\\
217 - Raj: I guess, uh, I’d like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way.\\
218 - Howard: That’s how you reject a guy.\\
219 - Amy: Okay, I don’t have time for this. I’m just gonna go find him and be brutally honest.\\
220 - Howard: No, don’t.\\
221 - Raj: He’ll be so upset. He’ll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.\\
222 - Howard: You want us to talk to him?\\
223 - Amy: Really? You would do that?\\
224 - Raj: Sure. We’ve both been in his shoes. We’ll let him down with compassion and respect.\\
225 - Amy: Thank you.\\
226 - Howard: Let’s go.\\
227 - Raj: So we tell him she’s a lesbian, right?\\
228 - Howard: Of course we tell him she’s a lesbian.\\
229 - Scene: The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.\\
230 - Penny: And hold three, two, one. Very good. Now let’s try Warrior 2. And hold.\\
231 - Sheldon: I’ve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.\\
232 - Penny: Yeah, well, I don’t think we’re gonna get to do that today.\\
233 - Sheldon: Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.\\
234 - Leonard: Oh, hey.\\
235 - Penny: And now we go to Reverse Warrior.\\
236 - Leonard: How did she get you to do yoga?\\
237 - Sheldon: Well, to be honest, I thought she said Yoda.\\
238 - Penny: I’m helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me.\\
239 - Leonard: Oh, how many times do I have to say it? I support you.\\
240 - Penny: Sheldon, take a break.\\
241 - Sheldon: Namaste.\\
242 - Penny: Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?\\
243 - Leonard: Fine. I’m not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didn’t you ask me before you did it?\\
244 - Penny: Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?\\
245 - Leonard: Yes. I thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. If I’m wrong, then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we’re actually in.\\
246 - Penny: Yeah, well, maybe we do.\\
247 - Sheldon: I’m willing to if you guys are.\\
248 - Leonard: Can we please have some privacy?\\
249 - Sheldon: Y, No. I’m as much a part of this relationship as you two, and I think it’s high time we put all our cards on the table. For example, where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And, if so, where will we all live? Have you thought about that?\\
250 - Leonard: No.\\
251 - Sheldon: Penny?\\
252 - Penny: Okay, wait. What are we doing?\\
253 - Leonard: For some reason, we’re planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever.\\
254 - Sheldon: Good. Now we’re getting somewhere.\\
255 - Penny: Look, I know you think I’m being reckless, and you might be right, but I need to take this shot.\\
256 - Sheldon: Yeah, no kidding. Despite what it says on her résumé, she is no longer 22. \\
257 - Leonard: I swear, I am on your side. \\
258 - Penny: You keep saying you’re on my side, but you don’t act like it.\\
259 - Sheldon: He does that to me, too. Why do we put up with it?\\
260 - Leonard: Listen, I could never do what you’re doing, okay? I would be terrified.\\
261 - Penny: Well, it’s scary for me, too.\\
262 - Sheldon: I’m fine with it.\\
263 - Leonard: My point is, just because I couldn’t do it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. And I’m proud of you. \\
264 - Penny: Okay. Thank you.\\
265 - Sheldon: Well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let’s all share a milk shake. Uh, Penny, you’ll need a straw.\\
266 - Scene: Capital Comics.\\
267 - Jesse: You’re back.\\
268 - Bernadette: Yes, I am, there’s a few more things I want to say to you. Stuart’s store is just fine, and he’s a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, I’d like to buy it right now.\\
269 - Jesse: No problem. Oh, you want a latte while you wait?\\
270 - Bernadette: No, I don’t want a latte. I want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone. \\
271 - Jesse: I only have chocolate chip.\\
272 - Bernadette: Well, that sounds even better.\\
273 - Scene: Bert’s car.\\
274 - Bert: Thanks for coming to the mineral and rock show with me.\\
275 - Raj: We’re sorry Amy didn’t want to go.\\
276 - Howard: Really, really sorry.\\
277 - Bert: Eh. Who needs her when I have you guys? Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock sho-o-o-o-o-ow!
\subsection {Episode 14: The Convention Conundrum}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Howard: T-minus 60 seconds.\\
3 - Raj: Oh, it all comes down to this.\\
4 - Leonard: Oh, I’ve got butterflies.\\
5 - Sheldon: Don’t get soft on me, Hofstadter. I will slap those glasses right off your face.\\
6 - Penny: What’s going on?\\
7 - Leonard: Hey. We’re about to buy tickets for Comic-Con.\\
8 - Penny: Oh.\\
9 - Howard: T Minus 45 seconds.\\
10 - Leonard: They sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of us gets in, we can buy passes…\\
11 - Sheldon: Good Lord, this is not the time for flirting, keep it in your pants.\\
12 - Penny: This is a whole lot of weird before coffee.\\
13 - Howard: T-minus 30 seconds.\\
14 - Raj: Oh, I have to go to the bathroom so bad.\\
15 - Sheldon: Every year. I told you, wear a diaper.\\
16 - Raj: And I told you I get diaper rash.\\
17 - Howard: 15 seconds.\\
18 - Leonard: Well, this is it, this is it. This is it.\\
19 - Howard: Five, four, three, two, one. \\
20 - Sheldon: It’s live. Go, go, go, go, go.\\
21 - Raj: Anyone in?\\
22 - Sheldon: No.\\
23 - Leonard: Not yet. \\
24 - Howard: Nope.\\
25 - Sheldon: Do not stop refreshing your screens.\\
26 - All (repeatedly): Refresh. Refresh. Refresh….\\
27 - Penny: Yeah, this is not gonna be enough coffee.\\
28 - Credits sequence.\\
29 - Scene: The same, shortly after.\\
30 - All (repeatedly): Refresh… Refresh… Refresh…\\
31 - Howard: It’s been ten minutes. We’re running out of time.\\
32 - Penny: To be cool? Yeah.\\
33 - Leonard: I did it, I did it, I’m in the queue.\\
34 - Sheldon: Yay! And they say firefighters are the real heroes.\\
35 - Raj: Uh, what number in line are you?\\
36 - Leonard: Uh, fifteen…\\
37 - Howard: Great.\\
38 - Leonard: …thousand two hundred and eleven.\\
39 - Howard: Damn.\\
40 - Raj: Oh, they only have Thursday and Sunday passes left.\\
41 - Howard: Really?\\
42 - Leonard: Oh, Thursday’s gone. Just Sunday left.\\
43 - Sheldon: Oh, Sunday’s the worst. Everybody’s leaving, most of the good panels are over, and the only T-shirts they have left are small and XXXXL.\\
44 - Leonard: Sunday’s gone.\\
45 - Sheldon: Not Sunday, I love Sunday.\\
46 - Raj: So that’s it? Everything’s sold out?\\
47 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
48 - Howard: I can’t believe we’re not going.\\
49 - Sheldon: It’s okay. You know, there, there’s always WonderCon in Anaheim, you know? That, that’s just as good. Excuse me.\\
50 - Penny: Oh, guys, this is really sad. And in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago.\\
51 - Sheldon: I can’t believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes.\\
52 - Penny: What? You were all going as the Hulk?\\
53 - Howard: Not the same Hulk. Ferrigno, Bana, Norton and Ruffalo.\\
54 - Raj: We would have been the angry green belles of the masquerade ball.\\
55 - All: Yeah. \\
56 - Penny: And we’re back to the first kind of sad.\\
57 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
58 - Sheldon: Gentlemen, I have the solution to our Comic-Con problem. We don’t need them. I’m starting my own convention.\\
59 - Leonard: Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us.\\
60 - Sheldon: I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for life. Life, Leonard. You’re gonna feel pretty silly when we’re 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days.\\
61 - Leonard: Do what you want. We’re getting scalped tickets.\\
62 - Howard: I already found a guy online who’s willing to sell.\\
63 - Sheldon: How do you know this isn’t a sting operation set up by the Comic-Con police?\\
64 - Leonard: The same way I know that the people in the TV set can’t see me.\\
65 - Howard: Sheldon, just come with us. You’re not gonna make your own convention.\\
66 - Sheldon: You know, there was a time when Comic-Con didn’t exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen. And you mark my words, I’m gonna rip that guy off.\\
67 - Scene: The apartment. \\
68 - Sheldon (on phone): Yes, I’m starting my own comic book convention, and I thought that your client, Robert Downey Jr., would be perfect to appear on our first panel. Oh, well, now, why are you saying no? You haven’t even asked him yet. You know, excuse me, but I sat through Iron Man 2. I believe he owes me two hours of his time. They hung up on me.\\
69 - Leonard: Did you tell them that you’re holding your convention at a Marie Callender’s, and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?\\
70 - Sheldon: I didn’t even get to that part.\\
71 - Leonard: Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a waste of time.\\
72 - Sheldon: Not true. Wil thinks this is a great idea. He was just concerned that he wasn’t a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event. Also, that’s the same day that he shampoos his beard.\\
73 - Leonard: Sheldon, buddy, I just don’t think this is going to come together for you.\\
74 - Sheldon: You don’t know that. I still have plenty of solid leads on this list.\\
75 - Leonard: Good luck.\\
76 - Sheldon: No, wait. I need you to call Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye the Science Guy, ’cause, legally, I’m not allowed to. Oh, and, also, Carrie Fisher, you know, ’cause I hear he can be pretty nuts.\\
77 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
78 - Penny: I can’t believe Leonard is spending hundreds of dollars on scalped tickets. \\
79 - Amy: Last week, you spent that on a little dress. \\
80 - Penny: Yeah, but those tickets only get him into Comic-Con. That dress gets me into anywhere I want.\\
81 - Bernadette: Those tickets were pretty expensive. I had to give Howie an advance on his allowance. Now he’s never gonna put his toys away.\\
82 - Amy: Why can’t they do something sensible like Sheldon and start their own comic book convention? Also, who wants to throw me out that window?\\
83 - Bernadette: Well, while they’re acting like teenagers, we could do something grown-up.\\
84 - Amy: Oh. You mean like a museum?\\
85 - Penny: Yes, like a museum, but anything else.\\
86 - Bernadette: Oh, I know. There’s a nice hotel not far from here where they do afternoon tea.\\
87 - Amy: Ooh, afternoon tea, how sophisticated of us.\\
88 - Penny: Oh, all right, if we’re gonna be fancy, I should probably put on clean underwear.\\
89 - Bernadette: La-dee-da, look who has clean underwear.\\
90 - Penny: No, we’re gonna stop at Target on the way.\\
91 - Scene: The apartment.\\
92 - Raj: Hey, since Sheldon’s not going to Comic-Con, maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as.\\
93 - Leonard: Mmm, what if we go as The Fantastic Four, and just tell people that the Invisible Girl is standing there with us.\\
94 - Howard: Oh, and I thought our days of pretending to be with women who don’t exist were over.\\
95 - Sheldon: Gentlemen, I am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention.\\
96 - Leonard: Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?\\
97 - Sheldon: I don’t think that will be necessary for Mr. James Earl Jones. You heard me. The voice of Darth Vader, the Lion King’s dad, and FYI, the guy who says, This is CNN. Which also sounds like Darth Vader.\\
98 - Raj: How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?\\
99 - Sheldon: Simple. Earlier today, he tweeted that he’s looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. That’s where he’ll be, and that’s where I’m going, and…\\
100 - Howard: And that’s where Darth Vader’s gonna pour soy sauce on your head.\\
101 - Leonard: Sheldon, I don’t care if you get scalped tickets with us or not, but please don’t be creepy and go stalking this poor guy. You’re gonna get in trouble.\\
102 - Sheldon: You’re the ones who are going to get in trouble. You’re buying non-transferable tickets. And from a stranger, no less. Not only can you get banned from Comic-Con, if caught, you could be charged with petty theft. You think about that while I’m warning James Earl Jones about the danger of posting his location on Twitter. He got lucky this time. There are some weirdoes out there. (To the Imperial March theme) Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, badala, baba, badalum, bom, badala, bom, bom, forgot my keys, bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum… \\
103 - Scene: The same, later.\\
104 - Howard (on phone): Okay, great. Bye. Our friendly neighbourhood scalper says he’s running late.\\
105 - Raj: Does he sound like a criminal?\\
106 - Howard: What do you mean?\\
107 - Raj: You know, did he say things like, youse guys, or, listen here, see?\\
108 - Leonard: Yes. He, he’s late because he’s on his way here from 1940.\\
109 - Raj: I’m just saying, we don’t know who this guy is. What if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys, or make a suit outof our skins?\\
110 - Howard: Why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin?\\
111 - Raj: I don’t know. Maybe ’cause dark doesn’t show the stains?\\
112 - Leonard: Well, now you’re making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location.\\
113 - Howard: Why do you think I told him to come to your place?\\
114 - Scene: Hotel tea room.\\
115 - Amy: There sure are a lot of little kids here.\\
116 - Penny: I can’t believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up.\\
117 - Bernadette: I can’t believe the waiter thought I was your daughter.\\
118 - Amy: Well, last time I got dressed up and had tea was when I was five. Just me, my teddy bear, Raggedy Ann and my hamster. \\
119 - Bernadette: That’s cute.\\
120 - Amy: It was. Till my hamster ate all her babies. It got less cute really fast.\\
121 - Bernadette: Should we leave?\\
122 - Penny: Well, there’s a bar in the lobby.\\
123 - Bernadette: I could go for a drink.\\
124 - Amy: Aw. Drinking in the afternoon, just like her mommy.\\
125 - Scene: A sushi restaurant.\\
126 - James Earl Jones: Let me guess. You like Star Wars. You know, I’ve been in other movies. But you don’t care about those, do you? I have one thing to say to people like you. I like Star Wars, too. Care to join me?\\
127 - Sheldon: Thank you. My friend Leonard said if I bothered you while you were eating, you’d think I was a creepy stalker.\\
128 - James Earl Jones: Well, your friend Leonard sounds like a real weenie.\\
129 - Sheldon: He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is.\\
130 - Scene: The apartment.\\
131 - Raj: Okay, so, I’m on a Comic-Con message board, and there’s a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone else’s badge, and Sheldon was right, he did get charged with petty theft. Guys, if I go to jail dressed as the Human Torch, that might send the wrong message.\\
132 - Leonard: Maybe this isn’t a good idea.\\
133 - Howard: I can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds.\\
134 - Raj: Do it.\\
135 - Howard: Okay. We’re officially not going to Comic-Con.\\
136 - Leonard: Hold on. We always do this. \\
137 - Howard: Do what?\\
138 - Leonard: Chicken out. We’re, we’re so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong.\\
139 - Raj: That’s ’cause we’re the good guys.\\
140 - Leonard: Even Batman breaks the rules. \\
141 - Raj: You know I struggle with Batman.\\
142 - Leonard: I say, this one time, instead of wimping out, let’s be badasses.\\
143 - Raj: Okay, I’ll be a badass, but only if you pinky-swear to be one, too.\\
144 - Leonard: Howard, you in on this?\\
145 - Howard: No need. I’m breaking rules all the time. \\
146 - Leonard: Name one.\\
147 - Howard: Last night. Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle.\\
148 - Raj: What about that little cup they give you?\\
149 - Howard: Yeah. What about it?\\
150 - Raj: Are you impressed by that?\\
151 - Leonard: A little.\\
152 - Raj: Yeah, me, too.\\
153 - Scene: The sushi restaurant.\\
154 - James: You know, when I first read the script for Empire Strikes Back and Darth Vader told Luke he was his father, I thought for sure he was lying.\\
155 - Sheldon: Me, too. But he wasn’t, was he?\\
156 - James: He was not. How messed up was that?\\
157 - Sheldon: So messed up.\\
158 - James: What do you say let’s go have some fun? My wife’s in New York, and I got a Lion King residual cheque burning a hole in my pocket.\\
159 - Scene: The hotel bar.\\
160 - Penny: So, afternoon tea was a bust.\\
161 - Amy: On the bright side, every six-year-old there was jealous of my tiara. Not gonna lie, it felt good.\\
162 - Penny: Let me ask you a question, when did you guys start feeling grown up? ‘Cause I am not sure I do.\\
163 - Bernadette: Honestly, I thought when I got married I would, but I still kind of feel like I’m pretending. It doesn’t help that most of my clothes come from Gap Kids.\\
164 - Penny: Okay, so I’m an adult, and the other day I saw an old man slip and fall down, and I laughed. I mean, I laughed hard. Like, like, out loud. If he was conscious, he would’ve heard me.\\
165 - Amy: Gosh.\\
166 - Penny: I know. One of the tennis balls came off his walker and bounced right off his head. I mean, I, I almost wet myself. I guess you had to be there.\\
167 - Amy: I think I have you both beat. Imagine trying to feel like a grown-up when you’ve never even been with a man.\\
168 - Penny: Okay, s*x is not what makes you a grown-up.\\
169 - Bernadette: Yeah. Or you’d be the oldest one here.\\
170 - Penny: Really? Is that how you talk to your mother?\\
171 - Scene: The apartment.\\
172 - Howard: He just parked. He’s on his way up.\\
173 - Leonard: Good. This is exciting.\\
174 - Raj: It is. I feel alive.\\
175 - Leonard: Yeah. What if we do get caught, who cares? So we get banned from Comic-Con.\\
176 - Raj: Maybe slapped with a fine.\\
177 - Howard: Oh, no. I’d be an astronaut and a bad boy, how will women keep their pants on?\\
178 - Raj: Uh, maybe it’ll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh, crap, what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship? \\
179 - Leonard: I wonder if we’d have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants.\\
180 - Raj: He’s gonna be here any second, what should we do?\\
181 - Howard: Okay, you guys are such babies. I’ll handle this. If he thinks we’re not home, he’ll go away.\\
182 - Raj: I thought you were a badass.\\
183 - Howard: I lied about the Pepto, I always use the little cup.\\
184 - Scene: An ice cream parlour.\\
185 - Sheldon: Is it true, as a child, you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years?\\
186 - James: It is true.\\
187 - Sheldon: Oh. Is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of Darth Vader breathing?\\
188 - James: They sure did.\\
189 - Sheldon: Oh. Is it true that you were pre-med in college and you almost became a doctor?\\
190 - James: That’s right.\\
191 - Sheldon: Oh, James, I could listen to your stories all night.\\
192 - Scene: The hotel bar.\\
193 - Penny: I mean, really, what’s so great about being grown up?\\
194 - Bernadette: Well, for starters, we’d be splitting this check three ways.\\
195 - Penny: I’m serious. Who wants to do all that stuff? Have insurance, pay mortgages, leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car.\\
196 - Amy: I told you it was Penny.\\
197 - Penny: Oh, come on, it wasn’t me. Anyone could have knocked your mirror off, or whatever happened.\\
198 - Amy: Maybe the guys are right. I mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring. I’m sure they’re having more fun than we are.\\
199 - Scene: The apartment. Banging on door.\\
200 - Howard: Oh, God, I could really use exactly two tablespoons of Pepto right now.\\
201 - Scene: A big wheel.\\
202 - Sheldon: Hey, Los Angeles. I’m on a Ferris Wheel with Darth Vader. And he’s nicer than you think.\\
203 - James: I am.\\
204 - Scene: A karaoke bar.\\
205 - Sheldon: In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight…\\
206 - James: Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh…\\
207 - Sheldon: Bring it home, Mufasa. Eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, um, um-a-weh.\\
208 - James: Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh…\\
209 - Sceme: Outside a house.\\
210 - Sheldon: I don’t understand what we’re doing.\\
211 - James: Shh.\\
212 - Sheldon: Whose house is this?\\
213 - James: Carrie Fisher. And she’s a little crazy, so get ready to run. (Rings doorbell)\\
214 - Carrie Fisher: It’s not funny anymore, James.\\
215 - James: Then why am I laughing?\\
216 - Scene: A sauna.\\
217 - James: Ah, Sheldon, this is the perfect end to a perfect night.\\
218 - Sheldon: Okay. But I think it could have ended with the karaoke.\\
219 - James: What were you trying to ask me at the strip club?\\
220 - Sheldon: Oh. How much does it cost to get them off my lap?\\
221 - James: No. Something about a convention.\\
222 - Sheldon: Oh, right. Well, my friends and I couldn’t get into Comic-Con this year, and I was trying to start my own convention, and I was going to ask if you would be a panelist.\\
223 - James: Why don’t you and your friends come to Comic-Con with me?\\
224 - Sheldon: Really?\\
225 - James: Of course. And San Diego is right across the border from my favorite city on Earth, Tijuana, where I’m taking you every night. \\
226 - Sheldon: Ay-yi-yi. \\
227 - James: Ay-yi-yi, bang-bang.\\
228 - Scene: The same, later.\\
229 - James: So, Beau Bridges is on my shoulders, and Jeff Bridges is on Marlon Brando’s shoulders, and remember, we do not have permission to be in the pool… hey, Sheldon, wake up. And Angie Dickinson is about to sic the dogs on us, and I go under the water and Marlon goes under the water, and the water raises about two feet and sloshes all over her patio, and the dogs freak out and run like hell, and then we run like hell. Oh, boy, that was a lot of fun.\\
230 - Sheldon: I’m sorry, who’s Angie Dickinson?
\subsection {Episode 15: The Locomotive Manipulation}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Amy: Item 28, your pet name for me. Time’s running out on this. You need to make a decision.\\
3 - Sheldon: I submitted you a notarised list. \\
4 - Amy: I’m sorry, but Gollum and Flakey are not acceptable.\\
5 - Sheldon: Well, you don’t like Princess Corncob, you don’t like Fester, you’re just impossible to please.\\
6 - Amy: We’ll come back to that one. This brings us to the final item in our annual State of the Relationship Summit. Item 29, Valentine’s Day.\\
7 - Sheldon: Ah, the worst for last. Hmm. Classic Flakey.\\
8 - Amy: Before you get upset, I believe I’ve come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy.\\
9 - Sheldon: People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one.\\
10 - Amy: I propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley.\\
11 - Sheldon: I hate every word in that sentence. Including in, at, we and a.\\
12 - Amy: Come on, Sheldon. Why not?\\
13 - Sheldon: For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table.\\
14 - Amy: One step ahead of you, Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us.\\
15 - Sheldon: Oh, very well. What are the sleeping arrangements? We’ve only been dating for three years. If we were to share a room, people might talk.\\
16 - Amy: I got you your own room. \\
17 - Sheldon: What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?\\
18 - Amy: It doesn’t. I know it makes you feel like you’re bathing inside a monster.\\
19 - Sheldon: Look, I appreciate the effort, but I’m still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me.\\
20 - Amy: We’re going to have Valentine’s Day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train.\\
21 - Sheldon: Vintage? Be specific.\\
22 - Amy: An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 Pullman first-class coaches.\\
23 - Sheldon: Wow. I’m feeling the urge to hug you. And one, and two, all right, Gollum, we’re good.\\
24 - Credits sequence.\\
25 - Scene: The apartment.\\
26 - Bernadette: Are you sure you guys don’t want to come with us to Napa? You could probably still get a room.\\
27 - Penny: No, I think we’re just gonna have a quiet weekend at home.\\
28 - Leonard: Plus, I’m not sure it’s a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. What? It’s a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it’s all for laughs.\\
29 - Penny: That would really piss me off if I didn’t have a buzz going on.\\
30 - Sheldon: Howard, which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train?\\
31 - Howard: I’m sorry, what?\\
32 - Sheldon: Oh, I’m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing.\\
33 - Howard: I don’t own a pocket watch.\\
34 - Sheldon: Oh, my. Well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot.\\
35 - Raj: Since you two are gonna be around for Valentine’s, would you mind watching Cinnamon?\\
36 - Penny: You have Valentine’s plans? Which came out sounding way more surprised than I meant. Here, let me try that again. You have Valent… See? I can’t do it.\\
37 - Raj: I don’t have plans which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night.\\
38 - Amy: Well, an evening looking at the stars, that’s still kind of romantic.\\
39 - Raj: Except I’ll be alone.\\
40 - Amy: I’m trying to put lipstick on a pig here. Work with me.\\
41 - Leonard: We’d be happy to watch Cinnamon.\\
42 - Penny: Yeah.\\
43 - Raj: Thank you. Oh, and I’d like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have s*x, it’s cool if she stays in the room.\\
44 - Penny: Hey, same goes for the two of you with Amy.\\
45 - Scene: The Pullman dining car.\\
46 - Amy: What do you think, Sheldon?\\
47 - Sheldon: It’s magnificent. This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever.\\
48 - Amy: I’m so glad you like it.\\
49 - Sheldon: I’m prepared to say I love it, as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard.\\
50 - Scene: The apartment. \\
51 - Leonard (on phone): Okay. Raj, I got it. Bye. (To Cinnamon) That was your daddy. He wanted me to say that he misses… Why am I doing this?\\
52 - Penny: Happy Valentine’s Day.\\
53 - Leonard: Ooh, flowers and chocolates? Somebody’s trying to get me out of my panties.\\
54 - Penny: Don’t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It came that way when I bought it.\\
55 - Leonard: Got you a little something, too.\\
56 - Penny: Aw, jewellery. Oh, my God, Lakers tickets?\\
57 - Leonard: It gets better. Instead of me, you can take someone who will actually enjoy it.\\
58 - Penny: Aw. You are the best boyfriend ever.\\
59 - Leonard: Thank you. Seriously, please don’t make me go.\\
60 - Penny: Should we take this little party to the bedroom?\\
61 - Leonard: Mm, don’t have to, we have the whole place to ourselves.\\
62 - Penny: Oh, that’s true. \\
63 - Leonard: In fact, if you want, we can do it right here on Sheldon’s spot.\\
64 - Penny: That is the least sexy thing anyone’s ever said to me.\\
65 - Leonard: To the bedroom.\\
66 - Penny: Yeah.\\
67 - Scene: The dining car.\\
68 - Waiter: And for the entrée, tonight’s special is a seafood risotto. Do you have any questions?\\
69 - Sheldon: Uh, I do. Uh, does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?\\
70 - Waiter: I’m sorry, I meant questions about the food.\\
71 - Sheldon: Oh, of course. Um, is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?\\
72 - Amy: Uh, I think we’re gonna need a minute.\\
73 - Man in seat behind: Fun fact, it’s neither. They actually use the AAR type E coupler. If you listen carefully when the locomotive disconnects, you’ll hear the characteristic click-pshht-thunk of the knuckle.\\
74 - Sheldon: Get out of town.\\
75 - Howard: Fun fact, I’m gonna jump off this train.\\
76 - Scene: The apartment.\\
77 - Leonard: Hey, Cinnamon, guess who just did it human style.\\
78 - Penny: Oh, my God.\\
79 - Leonard: It’s a little late, but I’ll take it.\\
80 - Penny: No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That’s really bad for dogs.\\
81 - Leonard: Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?\\
82 - Penny: We gotta get her to a vet right now.\\
83 - Leonard: I don’t have a vet. I have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. You’d think I’d have a vet.\\
84 - Penny: Okay. There’s one not far from here. Come on. Let’s go.\\
85 - Leonard: Okay. Koothrappali was right. We should have let her watch.\\
86 - Scene: The dining car.\\
87 - Sheldon: Do another one, do another one.\\
88 - Man: Okay. Here’s my impression of the Amtrak Acela barreling down the Eastern Corridor. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. \\
89 - Sheldon: It’s like there’s a train in your mouth. Howard: Oh, yeah. I’ve got one. Um, the Amtrak Wolverine coming into Chicago. Bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch, bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch. Ooo-ooo.\\
90 - Man: I’ve been on that train. And I just was again.\\
91 - Amy: See if you guys can guess this one. Bang. Splat. Thud.\\
92 - Sheldon: How many trains have you been on?\\
93 - Man: Tons. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.\\
94 - Sheldon: Wow. Your life’s amazing.\\
95 - Man: Not always. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.\\
96 - Amy: Why do I even try?\\
97 - Bernadette: I’m gonna fix this right now.\\
98 - Howard: Okay. Just make it look like an accident.\\
99 - Bernadette: Excuse me. You are at Valentine’s dinner with your girlfriend. Now get back over there and be with her.\\
100 - Sheldon: You’re right. That was insensitive of me. I have to go back to my table now. You should join us.\\
101 - Man: All right.\\
102 - Bernadette: Great. Now there’s two of ‘em.\\
103 - Scene: A vet’s surgery.\\
104 - Lady Vet: How much chocolate did she eat?\\
105 - Penny: A whole box.\\
106 - Leonard: Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me. \\
107 - Penny: So the point is I may have saved her life.\\
108 - Vet: I’m sorry, is this a joke to you?\\
109 - Leonard: No. Maybe to her.\\
110 - Vet: How big a box of chocolate was it?\\
111 - Penny: Uh, something like this. I don’t know. It came free with a full tank of gas.\\
112 - Leonard: Really? Do you know how much those Lakers tickets were?\\
113 - Penny: Do you know how much gas is?\\
114 - Vet: Hey.\\
115 - Penny: Sorry.\\
116 - Leonard: Sorry.\\
117 - Raj: Oh, my God, Cinnamon, are you okay? I can’t believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs, I’ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts.\\
118 - Vet: You’re the owner?\\
119 - Raj: Owner, father, soul mate, and if anything happens to her, your worst nightmare.\\
120 - Vet: Well, she’s not throwing up, which is a good sign. So, I’m gonna take her in back, put her on fluids and give her something to absorb the toxins. \\
121 - Raj: Okay. Okay, thank you. Oh, if she’s scared, you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh, but don’t do Firework, that gets her all riled up.\\
122 - Vet: Got it. Should have been a dentist.\\
123 - Scene: The dining car.\\
124 - Man: Okay, what was the best four-ten-four U.S. Locomotive ever built?\\
125 - Sheldon: Trick question. There never was one.\\
126 - Man: Or was there? \\
127 - Sheldon: What?\\
128 - Man: In 1944, the Pacific Railroad built number 6131, which rearranged the drivers and cylinders, solving the problem of the Q-1, creating a duplex-drive four-four-six-four.\\
129 - Sheldon: In what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four? \\
130 - Howard: A world I don’t want to live in. Seriously, I no longer want to live in this world.\\
131 - Man: Hold on to your conductor’s hat. You crank the second and third axles, creating a pair of internal connecting rods, and boom, four-ten-four. If you think about it, the Q-2 was like the four-ten-four America never made.\\
132 - Sheldon: I may never stop thinking about it. Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?\\
133 - Waiter: Better than you think.\\
134 - Man: You know, if you ask nicely, they’ll let you visit the engine room.\\
135 - Sheldon: I never want this day to end.\\
136 - Amy: It’s feeling like it never will.\\
137 - Sheldon: Come on.\\
138 - Man: Hey, did I tell you what happened to me at UPS?\\
139 - Scene: The vets surgery.\\
140 - Raj: As if Valentine’s Day wasn’t bad enough, you try to kill my dog? And with cheap chocolate, no less?\\
141 - Penny: It wasn’t cheap. It was free.\\
142 - Leonard: We’re really sorry. It was an accident.\\
143 - Penny: Yeah, we weren’t even out of the room that long.\\
144 - Leonard: Oh, no, come on. It was a while. It was a while.\\
145 - Raj: Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?\\
146 - Vet: She’s responding well. We just want to keep her a little longer for observation.\\
147 - Raj: All right. Uh, would, would it be okay for me to see her? We’re usually in bed by now, and I want her to know that I’m here. Yes, we sleep together, and sometimes we spoon.\\
148 - Vet: It’s okay. I sleep with my dog, too. We’re not supposed to let people in back, but I think I can make an exception.\\
149 - Raj: Thank you.\\
150 - Vet: Come on. By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.\\
151 - Raj: Oh, yeah?\\
152 - Vet: And I don’t care what that obnoxious parrot back there says. I crushed it.\\
153 - Penny: I think there’s something going on between the two of them.\\
154 - Leonard: Maybe, but you also think nine minutes isn’t a while, so what do you know?\\
155 - Scene: The dining car.\\
156 - Howard: You okay?\\
157 - Amy: Why? Because my boyfriend’s off playing choo-choo with some weirdo?\\
158 - Howard: Well, to be fair, they’re both weirdos.\\
159 - Amy: I don’t know what made me think tonight would be any different.\\
160 - Bernadette: Well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot. To be honest, I bet Howie 200\\
161 - bucks it wasn’t gonna happen.\\
162 - Howard: I’m going to the Lego store to get a big-ass R2-D2.\\
163 - Bernadette: See? It’s not just Sheldon. They’re all idiots.\\
164 - Howard: She’s right. \\
165 - Bernadette: So, your boyfriend’s a fixer-upper. Most of them are. I mean, look at this guy. You think he came like this? When I met him, he was a hot, goofy mess. Now, he’s been to space. That’s all me.\\
166 - Howard: I had a little to do with it.\\
167 - Bernadette: Oh, sure you did. Who’s Mama’s big space man?\\
168 - Howard: I am.\\
169 - Scene: The vets surgery.\\
170 - Leonard: They’ve been in there, like, half an hour.\\
171 - Penny: Yeah, for future reference, that’s a while.\\
172 - Leonard: How long should we stay?\\
173 - Penny: I don’t know. I’m kind of hungry.\\
174 - Leonard: I saw a Thai place next door.\\
175 - Penny: Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey.\\
176 - Leonard: How’s she doing?\\
177 - Penny: How is everything?\\
178 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
179 - Raj: She’s gonna be okay; they’re gonna let me take her home.\\
180 - Penny: Oh, good.\\
181 - Vet: So I want you to keep a close eye on her for the next 24 hours. Here are a few warning signs to look out for, and if you see any of them, don’t hesitate to call.\\
182 - Raj: Oh. Thank you for taking such good care of my little girl.\\
183 - Vet: My pleasure. Have a nice night.\\
184 - Leonard: Yes, thank you for all your help.\\
185 - Penny: Yeah. I’m sorry if you didn’t think we were taking it seriously. We love animals.\\
186 - Vet: Oh, do you guys own any pets?\\
187 - Penny: No.\\
188 - Vet: Good.\\
189 - Scene: The dining car.\\
190 - Howard: I love you so much.\\
191 - Bernadette: I love you, too.\\
192 - Howard: Sorry.\\
193 - Bernadette: Sorry.\\
194 - Man: You guys missed a pretty great time. \\
195 - Sheldon: The conductor and I have the same pocket watch. \\
196 - Man: It was crazy. \\
197 - Sheldon: Dare I say loco? Oh, and, Amy, guess what? The conductor said as soon as he gets off work, he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us.\\
198 - Amy: Okay. I need to speak to my boyfriend in private, like, right now.\\
199 - Howard: There’s a car with a glass roof. Want to go look at the stars?\\
200 - Bernadette: Oh, that sounds so romantic.\\
201 - Amy: Oh, give it a rest.\\
202 - Bernadette: Let’s go.\\
203 - Amy: Why are you still here?\\
204 - Sheldon: Excuse me. I think you’re being a little rude.\\
205 - Amy: I’m being rude? You’ve been rude to me this entire evening.\\
206 - Sheldon: How is that possible? I’ve hardly spoken to you since we got on the train.\\
207 - Man: I’m detecting a little friction between you two, and I don’t want to be a third rail. Get it?\\
208 - Sheldon: I get it.\\
209 - Amy: Leave.\\
210 - Sheldon: What is your problem?\\
211 - Amy: It’s Valentine’s Day. We’re supposed to be having a romantic weekend.\\
212 - Sheldon: Oh, really? Because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. Did you mean that, or were you just trying to trick me?\\
213 - Amy: Fine, it’s true. I deserve romance, and I didn’t know how else to make it happen.\\
214 - Sheldon: Well, if you want romance, then let’s have romance. Oh, look, there’s wine. Mmm. Grape juice that burns. Uh, now let’s gaze into each other’s eyes, hmm? You blinked. I win.\\
215 - Amy: Sheldon.\\
216 - Sheldon: Let’s see. What’s next? Oh, kissing’s romantic.\\
217 - Amy: That was nice.\\
218 - Sheldon: Good. Um, the conductor said if I come back to the engine room, he’d show me how to bring the train through a crossing.\\
219 - Amy: Okay, have fun.\\
220 - Sheldon: Do you want to come with me?\\
221 - Amy: Really? I do.\\
222 - Man: Hey, guys, wait up.\\
223 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
224 - Raj: There you go. All cozy wozy. Here, let’s see what the doctor says to keep an eye out for. Hmm. Rajesh, I was dreading Valentine’s Day. Thank you for spending it with me. Yvette. Cinnamon, she-she gave me her phone number. If I’d known it was that easy, I would have considered poisoning you months ago. Oh, what should I say? Oh, I know. I’ll point out her name’s Yvette, and that she’s a vet. That’s hysterical. She’ll love it.\\
225 - Scene: The apartment.\\
226 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
227 - Leonard: Oh, hey. You’re back. How was your trip?\\
228 - Sheldon: It was wonderful. \\
229 - Leonard: Great. What did you do?\\
230 - Sheldon: I made a new friend who likes trains as much as I do, uh, I kissed Amy on the lips, and, uh, the conductor played his banjo for me. Good night.\\
231 - Leonard: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I’m gonna need more details.\\
232 - Sheldon: Oh, well, my new friend’s name was Eric. Um, Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. Oh, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger, but he made up for it with his can-do attitude.\\
233 - Leonard: No, hang on. Hang on. Are all those things equal to you?\\
234 - Sheldon: Hmm. It never occurred to me to pick a favourite.\\
235 - Leonard: Well, give it a go.\\
236 - Sheldon: I can’t answer that without collecting additional data.\\
237 - Leonard: Additional data. You dog.\\
238 - Sheldon: I’m not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog, but all right.
\subsection {Episode 16: The Table Polarization}
1 - Scene: The apartment\\
2 - Howard: I’m thinking about growing a goatee.\\
3 - Raj: Oh, actually that’s a Van Dyke. A goatee is just hair on the chin.\\
4 - Leonard: Oh. Wait, then what is it if you just have hair up here?\\
5 - Raj: You mean a moo-stache?\\
6 - Leonard: Moo-stache.\\
7 - Howard: He said it.\\
8 - Raj: Ha-ha, very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy. For your information, there are four times as many Indians as there are Americans, so the way we say it is right.\\
9 - Howard: Say what?\\
10 - Raj: Moo-stache.\\
11 - Leonard: Moo-stache.\\
12 - Howard: He said it.\\
13 - Bernadette: Guys, you’re being childish.\\
14 - Sheldon: Yeah, she’s right. You’re grown men, the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches.\\
15 - Amy: Hey, you were funny on purpose, good job.\\
16 - Penny: Hi. Sorry I’m late, I was at an audition.\\
17 - Leonard: Oh, I’m sorry.\\
18 - Sheldon: You’ll get ‘em next time.\\
19 - Penny: How about instead of assuming I failed, you ask me how it went?\\
20 - Leonard: Sorry. How did it go?\\
21 - Penny: Just shut up.\\
22 - Raj: Here, you can have your seat.\\
23 - Penny: No, no, no, stay there. I’m fine on the floor.\\
24 - Bernadette: Have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table?\\
25 - Amy: Yeah. You actually do have room for one up there.\\
26 - Raj: Oh, sure, I sit on the floor for years, no one cares. The pretty white girl’s there ten seconds, and suddenly we’re all running to IKEA.\\
27 - Sheldon: No one is running anywhere. We’re not getting a dining room table.\\
28 - Leonard: I know you don’t like change, but it’s not a terrible idea.\\
29 - Penny: Yeah, you guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?\\
30 - Sheldon: Do you want the long answer or the short answer?\\
31 - Howard: Hey, how come we never get that option?\\
32 - Sheldon: Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system, if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear, a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result.\\
33 - Penny: Translation?\\
34 - Leonard: Waah. I don’t want a table.\\
35 - Credits sequence.\\
36 - Scene: The apartment.\\
37 - Leonard: Hey, Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table. You want to come with us?\\
38 - Sheldon: You know, I’d love to, but, um, I’m too busy falling back in love with Windows 98.\\
39 - Leonard: Seriously? You haven’t used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it, you’re up here working?\\
40 - Sheldon: I can’t talk right now, I have several thousand updates to install.\\
41 - Leonard: Are you really gonna sit here all day?\\
42 - Sheldon: Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home.\\
43 - Leonard: If you’ll recall, the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway.\\
44 - Sheldon: It’s a made-up story, Leonard, I don’t even know why you’re talking about it.\\
45 - Leonard: I’m putting all this stuff in storage. We don’t need any of it.\\
46 - Sheldon: You, how can you say that? You show me one thing in here we can live without.\\
47 - Leonard: Oh, hang on. Check your in-box.\\
48 - Sheldon: Wait. Is this really worth it? We’ve lived together for years with nary an argument.\\
49 - Leonard: Huh?\\
50 - Sheldon: But we start talking about a table, and suddenly we’re at each other’s throats.\\
51 - Leonard: Nary an argument? Nary?\\
52 - Sheldon: Well, that means not one, or not any. Maybe instead of a table, you should buy a dictionary. Well, I don’t know if I won that, but at least he’s upset.\\
53 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
54 - Howard: Check it out.\\
55 - Raj: Magic wand TV remote?\\
56 - Howard: Yeah, I can control all sorts of stuff.\\
57 - Raj: Did Bernadette think it was cool?\\
58 - Howard: Not when I said mute and pointed it at her face.\\
59 - Raj: Oh, uh, let me try. Uh, channelis changeroni. This might be my second favorite brown magic wand.\\
60 - Howard: Well, that’s the last time I play with that. (Phone rings) I have to take this. Hello? 00:04:24,137\\
61 - Raj: Uh, off. And on. And the Oprah Network. This is so much better than watching TV like a muggle.\\
62 - Howard: Okay. Thank you. We’ll be in touch. You’re not gonna believe this.\\
63 - Raj: What’s going on? Oh. Wait. On. And off. What’s going on?\\
64 - Howard: That was NASA. They want me to go back up to the space station.\\
65 - Raj: Wow. What did you tell them?\\
66 - Howard: I told them I’d be honoured.\\
67 - Raj: A second trip to space, I’ll miss you.\\
68 - Howard: And I’m gonna miss you, too.\\
69 - Raj: And I just want you to know, I’m happy to look in on Bernadette while you’re gone.\\
70 - Howard: Thank you.\\
71 - Raj: And if anything were to happen to you, we will name our first born son Howard. I’m just kidding. We’ll name him Dalib, after my grandfather.\\
72 - Scene: A furniture store.\\
73 - Penny: Ooh, this one looks nice.\\
74 - Leonard: No. Sheldon doesn’t like reclaimed wood.\\
75 - Penny: Why not?\\
76 - Leonard: He’s afraid the original owners will come back.\\
77 - Penny: Yeah. Well, Sheldon’s not here.\\
78 - Leonard: Well, he is here. So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, there’s nothing I can do about it.\\
79 - Penny: All right, sweetie, you’re paying for this table, and it’s your apartment, too.\\
80 - Leonard: I know, but…\\
81 - Penny: No buts. You got to stop letting him boss you around.\\
82 - Leonard: You’re right. I mean, he decides what TV shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted Frodo, but we can’t both have Frodo, so guess who’s stuck with Samwise Gamgee.\\
83 - Penny: See? Right there. You’re a grown man, you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldn’t, but one problem at a time.\\
84 - Leonard: You make a lot of sense. I like this table, and I’m getting it.\\
85 - Penny: Really? This one?\\
86 - Leonard: That one? Damn right I like that one.\\
87 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
88 - Bernadette: Hey.\\
89 - Howard: Good news. Someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket.\\
90 - Bernadette: Fine. Can I at least shower first?\\
91 - Howard: No, not that. Although you already agreed to it, so no take-backs.\\
92 - Bernadette: What are you talking about?\\
93 - Howard: Sit down. NASA called. The telescope mount I installed on the space station got damaged, and they want me to go back up and fix it.\\
94 - Bernadette: Wow. Well, what did you say?\\
95 - Howard: What do you think I said? I said yes. Why do you look surprised?\\
96 - Bernadette: Well, it’s just, after last time, I didn’t think you’d ever want to go back.\\
97 - Howard: Are you kidding? It was the greatest experience of my life.\\
98 - Bernadette: Really? ‘Cause I kind of remember a lot of complaining and wishing for it to be over.\\
99 - Howard: I think you have me confused with what’s gonna happen when you get out of that shower.\\
100 - Scene: The apartment.\\
101 - Leonard: Hey, all set. What do you think? There’s plenty of room for everybody, a view out the window.\\
102 - Sheldon: My spot on the couch has a great view of a window. Sometimes I can see space battles through it. It’s called a TV.\\
103 - Penny: Give it a chance, Sheldon, you might actually like it.\\
104 - Sheldon: You’re absolutely right. Nope.\\
105 - Penny: Well, you can’t say he didn’t give it a fair shot.\\
106 - Sheldon: So, when can we get rid of it?\\
107 - Leonard: We’re not.\\
108 - Sheldon: What about the roommate agreement? It specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the Furnishing Committee. Which only sits on alternate years. Yeah, and by the way, it sits over there.\\
109 - Penny: Come on, that is ridiculous.\\
110 - Leonard: She’s right, a committee that important should meet more often.\\
111 - Penny: That’s not what I’m saying.\\
112 - Leonard: Oh. This is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life?\\
113 - Penny: Yes.\\
114 - Leonard: That.\\
115 - Sheldon: Okay. I think we’ve found the problem here. It’s not the table at all. It’s you.\\
116 - Penny: Me?\\
117 - Leonard: Well, it’s always me, take one for the team.\\
118 - Sheldon: I have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will, and then you came along and reshaped him, with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals.\\
119 - Penny: Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?\\
120 - Leonard: Fancy sounds like a compliment.\\
121 - Penny: Okay, I have not tried to change Leonard. That’s just what happens in relationships. Look how much Amy’s changed you.\\
122 - Sheldon: That’s not true.\\
123 - Penny: Oh, please. When I first met you, you were incapable of touching another human being. Now you’re holding hands, you’re going on dates, you even made out with her on a train.\\
124 - Sheldon: She told you?\\
125 - Penny: Of course she told me, it’s the most interesting thing that’s ever happened to her in her entire life.\\
126 - Leonard: You’re too close to it, but Amy has had a huge impact on you.\\
127 - Sheldon: You’re right. Without realizing it, I’ve allowed that woman to alter my personality.\\
128 - Leonard: Mm, Sheldon, you didn’t have a personality, you just had some shows you liked.\\
129 - Sheldon: No. No, I’ve changed. Like the frog who’s put in a pot of water that’s heated so gradually he doesn’t realize he’s boiling to death.\\
130 - Penny: Or you’re the frog who’s been kissed by a princess and turned into a prince.\\
131 - Leonard: Or you’re just a tall, annoying frog.\\
132 - Sheldon: Excuse me. I have to break up with my girlfriend.\\
133 - Penny: Oh, Sheldon, wait.\\
134 - Sheldon: No. You’ve opened my eyes to the truth. Amy has made me a more affectionate, open-minded person. And that stops now.\\
135 - Leonard: Well, we should call her.\\
136 - Penny: Yeah, mm-hmm. Amy, it’s Penny. Hey. Just a little heads-up. Leonard bought a dining room table. Yeah. Sheldon’s breaking up with you.\\
137 - Scene: Amy’s apartment.\\
138 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? I’ll get right to the point. I think we need to end this relationship, so just sign this with your finger, and, uh, please don’t cry on my iPad, I didn’t get AppleCare.\\
139 - Amy: I’m not surprised you want to end the relationship. I’m a little surprised you didn’t get AppleCare. Anyway, enjoy your life. Where do I sign?\\
140 - Sheldon: At the bottom. I must say, I’m relieved you’re not making more of a scene out of this.\\
141 - Amy: Oh, I’ve already moved on. Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me.\\
142 - Sheldon: It doesn’t?\\
143 - Amy: Of course not. This is just Leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship. He’s manipulating you like he always does.\\
144 - Sheldon: Wait, wait, now, hang on. You think he manipulates me?\\
145 - Amy: All the time. And he knew that, as your girlfriend, I wasn’t gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. I mean, a table? Come on?\\
146 - Sheldon: It is hideous.\\
147 - Amy: Well, thankfully, I won’t have to see it, ’cause I won’t be your girlfriend anymore. Amy Farrah Fowler. Why, yes, I would like to take a survey.\\
148 - Sheldon: Wait. You were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table?\\
149 - Amy: Of course I was.\\
150 - Sheldon: Wait. How do I know that you’re not manipulating me right now?\\
151 - Amy: I think if I were manipulating you, you’d be smart enough to see it.\\
152 - Sheldon: How do I know you’re not saying that as part of the manipulation?\\
153 - Amy: I think you’d be smart enough to see that, too.\\
154 - Sheldon: Okay. I’m sorry I gave you such a hard time, I just had to be sure.\\
155 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
156 - Raj: It’s pretty exciting that NASA wants to send Howard back up.\\
157 - Bermadette: Yeah, exciting. Can I ask you something?\\
158 - Raj: Course.\\
159 - Bernadette: He hated that entire experience. Does it make me an awful wife if I don’t think he should do it again?\\
160 - Raj: Not at all. He’s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. It’s like me in those moments when I miss India.\\
161 - Bernadette: So you’ll talk to him?\\
162 - Raj: Why me?\\
163 - Bernadette: Well, I’m his wife, I don’t want to ruin it for him.\\
164 - Raj: That’s the dynamic, I’m the fun one, you’re the buzzkill.\\
165 - Bernadette: Since when am I the buzzkill?\\
166 - Raj: Do you think this is cool?\\
167 - Bernadette: No, I think it’s stupid.\\
168 - Raj: Aha.\\
169 - Bernadette: You’re right, it’s great.\\
170 - Scene: The apartment.\\
171 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
172 - Leonard: Oh, hey. You guys didn’t break up.\\
173 - Sheldon: No. Sorry to disappoint you, but Amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me.\\
174 - Amy: Which you also figured out by yourself.\\
175 - Sheldon: Which I also figured out by myself.\\
176 - Penny: Well, I’m glad you’re still together.\\
177 - Sheldon: Yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship.\\
178 - Amy: Which is stronger than ever.\\
179 - Sheldon: Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was.\\
180 - Howard: But it got the way it was through change. The-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. I bought this couch. Me. So explain why that change was bad and this change was good.\\
181 - Sheldon: Um.\\
182 - Amy: You don’t need to explain yourself to him.\\
183 - Sheldon: I don’t need to explain myself to you!\\
184 - Amy: You’re sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.\\
185 - Sheldon: Keep the table. We don’t use that space.\\
186 - Amy: Damn it, I got cocky.\\
187 - Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.\\
188 - Howard: Hey, Bernie. I’m home. Hello.\\
189 - Bernadette: Hi, honey.\\
190 - Howard: What’s going on?\\
191 - Bernadette: Maybe you should have a seat.\\
192 - Howard: Um, okay. I know my mom’s not dead, there’d be balloons.\\
193 - Raj: Um, okay. First off, know that we all love you and cherish you.\\
194 - Mike Rostenkowski: Well, I wouldn’t…\\
195 - Bernadette: Daddy.\\
196 - Mike R: You’re great.\\
197 - Mike Massimino (on skype): Can I say something?\\
198 - Raj: Oh, of course.\\
199 - Mike M: Hey, Fruit Loops.\\
200 - Howard: Massimino? Why are you here?\\
201 - Mike M: Well, I heard you were thinking about going back up to the space station, and as someone who’s been there with you, well, you know how astronauts need to have the right stuff?\\
202 - Howard: Sure.\\
203 - Mike M: The stuff you have is wrong.\\
204 - Howard: You don’t think I did a good job up there?\\
205 - Mike M: You did a fine job. It’s just, you were scared and miserable the whole time.\\
206 - Bernadette: I think what we’re all trying to say is, you don’t seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you.\\
207 - Raj: Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.\\
208 - Mike R: Like a woman. Great analogy.\\
209 - Howard: Fine, maybe I was a little scared.\\
210 - Mike M: You peed in your space suit.\\
211 - Howard: You’re supposed to do that.\\
212 - Mike M: Not during the fitting.\\
213 - Mike R: Son, do I need to remind you what you asked me to do before you went up last time?\\
214 - Howard: Hang on. That was just me joking around.\\
215 - Mike R: You wanted me to shoot you in the foot.\\
216 - Howard: Come on, how is that not a joke? You got to get me out of this. Shoot me in the foot.\\
217 - Bernadette: Don’t forget all the other astronauts picking on you.\\
218 - Raj: And how you threw up in zero gravity, and it floated back in your mouth. And you threw up again. And so on and so on.\\
219 - Mike M: That was funny.\\
220 - Howard: Okay, so I wasn’t exactly John Glenn up there, but I’ve changed. I’m a different man now. Yeah, and I’m a little insulted that you guys don’t think I can handle it.\\
221 - Mike M: You know you’re gonna have to go through survival training again.\\
222 - Howard: Really?\\
223 - Scene: A doctor’s surgery.\\
224 - Howard: You’ve got to get me out of this.\\
225 - Doctor: What do you want me to do? You’re perfectly healthy.\\
226 - Howard: Check my blood pressure again. I can get it higher. just give me a second. (Dials phone) \\
227 - Mrs Wolowitz (on phone): Hello?\\
228 - Howard: Hi, Ma. How are you?\\
229 - Mrs Wolowitz: How I am is not dead, but you wouldn’t know that, because you don’t love me enough to pick up the phone.\\
230 - Howard: Go, go, go.\\
231 - Mrs Wolowitz: For all you know, I could have slipped in the tub and drowned. That’s what happened to your Aunt Ida.\\
232 - Doctor: Wow.\\
233 - Scene: The apartment.\\
234 - Raj: Howard, I’m so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts.\\
235 - Howard: Oh, me, too. I mean, the doctor was willing to fudge the results, but it just seemed so darned dishonest.\\
236 - Leonard: But the mission wouldn’t be for at least a year. Isn’t that enough time to get your blood pressure under…\\
237 - Howard: Look, my blood pressure’s too high, okay? Drop it.\\
238 - Penny: You know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a few months, she…\\
239 - Howard: Went to space? I don’t think so. Now, pass the soy sauce. Hey, not the green one, the red one.\\
240 - Penny: Sheldon, Amy, will you please come join us?\\
241 - Bernadette: Yeah, it’s fun up here.\\
242 - Leonard: So why are you trying to ruin it?\\
243 - Sheldon: No, thanks. We’re fine. I mean, if you people want to eat at the table, then that’s what you should do. I like eating down here because this is how we’ve always done things. But if those days are gone, they’re gone. It just makes me sad.\\
244 - Bernadette: Now I feel bad.\\
245 - Leonard: Oh, don’t anthropomorphize him, he’s got big eyes, but his feelings are not like ours.\\
246 - Bernadette: No, it just seems silly for us to sit in two groups.\\
247 - Leonard: Well, it’s not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big, evil baby.\\
248 - Bernadette: Look at Amy down there. Should we go?\\
249 - Penny: Yeah, let’s go.\\
250 - Leonard: But Penny, this was your idea. You said that I should stand up to him.\\
251 - Penny: Forget it, Leonard. It’s over.\\
252 - Leonard: Fine.\\
253 - Amy: Rajesh?\\
254 - Raj: Screw that! I sat on the floor for seven years. I’m staying right here.\\
255 - Bernadette: Come on, Raj, it’s not the same without you.\\
256 - Raj: Fine. But no more making fun of how I say tings.\\
257 - Howard: You mean tings like moo-stache?\\
258 - Sheldon: Well, isn’t this nice. Sometimes the baby wins.
\subsection {Episode 17: The Friendship Turbulence}
1 - Sceme: The apartment\\
2 - Bernadette: Raj, your tag’s sticking out.\\
3 - Raj: Thank you. That was the closest I’ve come to s*x in, like, two years.\\
4 - Bernadette: Now I feel a little gross.\\
5 - Raj: You’re only making it seem more real for me.\\
6 - Howard: Hey, that’s my wife. If anyone’s gonna make her feel gross about s*x, it’s me.\\
7 - Raj: Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?\\
8 - Sheldon: How about Penny’s depressing acting career?\\
9 - Leonard: Hey. I mean, it’s been a little tough, but Penny’s following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing.\\
10 - Penny: Aw, thank you.\\
11 - Howard: Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get s*x?\\
12 - Raj: Is that a real book? I would totally read that book.\\
13 - Amy: Can I borrow it when you’re done?\\
14 - Penny: Well, I’ll have you guys know I turned down a part in a movie last week.\\
15 - Leonard: Why would you do that?\\
16 - Penny: Because it was crap. It’s a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.\\
17 - Bernadette: Serial Ape-ist? I thought you died in that.\\
18 - Sheldon: She does. 42 minutes in.\\
19 - Raj: While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.\\
20 - Sheldon: I have an eidetic memory. I don’t know what his problem is.\\
21 - Penny: Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape’s DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.\\
22 - Sheldon: Am I missing something, or isn’t that the part she was born to play?\\
23 - Credits sequence.\\
24 - Scene: The apartment.\\
25 - Leonard: So are you really not gonna do this movie?\\
26 - Penny: Well, I don’t think it’s the kind of part that’s good for my career.\\
27 - Leonard: Well, but don’t a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?\\
28 - Penny: Okay, I don’t think Meryl Streep ever had to say “Must keep gorilla hands from killing again!”\\
29 - Raj: If she did, it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong.\\
30 - Leonard: I don’t know anything about show business, so if you think it’s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, I’m sure you know what you’re doing.\\
31 - Amy: I think we’re gonna go.\\
32 - Sheldon: Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didn’t get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard’s.\\
33 - Howard: Hey, I work at the same university you do.\\
34 - Sheldon: Yes, and Hawkeye’s in the Avengers, but no one ever says help, Hawkeye.\\
35 - Bernadette: Can I ask you something? Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?\\
36 - Penny: Oh, I’m sure he does it out of love. The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices.\\
37 - Amy: I think we’re gonna go.\\
38 - Leonard: No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you’d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it’s a fight.\\
39 - Sheldon: Well, with that sorted out, I’m happy to answer your question, Bernadette. Howard started it.\\
40 - Howard: I didn’t do anything. I was just sitting here.\\
41 - Sheldon: I wasn’t referring to this evening. Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.\\
42 - Raj: Ha-a-a. Still funny.\\
43 - Bernadette: That was ten years ago.\\
44 - Sheldon: Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.\\
45 - Amy: Really?\\
46 - Howard: The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. That’s funny.\\
47 - Raj: I was there. It was funny.\\
48 - Sheldon: In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.\\
49 - Scene: The street\\
50 - Amy: Thanks for walking me to my car.\\
51 - Raj: Actually, it’s for both of us. Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I’m a little freaked out by street gangs.\\
52 - Amy: Why can’t Raj find a girl? The mystery continues.\\
53 - Raj: I don’t appreciate your sarcasm, but we’ve still got two blocks to go, so I’ll put up with it.\\
54 - Amy: Whatever happened with your online dating?\\
55 - Raj: No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.\\
56 - Amy: Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too. Once, I even dropped in on my OBGYN just to get some human contact.\\
57 - Raj: It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.\\
58 - Amy: Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.\\
59 - Raj: What? You’ve kissed, like, once in three years.\\
60 - Amy: That’s true. Do whatever you want.\\
61 - Scene: Sheldon’s office.\\
62 - Howard: Hey.\\
63 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
64 - Howard: Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends.\\
65 - Sheldon: Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.\\
66 - Howard: Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and she made some great points. You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn’t hear the rest ’cause she took her bra off.\\
67 - Sheldon: Very well. How do you propose we move forward?\\
68 - Howard: Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.\\
69 - Sheldon: That’s a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.\\
70 - Howard: Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette can’t go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and I’ll show you around the space centre.\\
71 - Sheldon: I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you’ve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?\\
72 - Howard: No.\\
73 - Sheldon: I’m glad because I would not have seen that coming.\\
74 - Scene: Amy’s lab.\\
75 - Raj: Amy, I could use some help.\\
76 - Amy: Oh. Let me guess. There’s an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.\\
77 - Raj: I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl’s profile. She’s amazing.\\
78 - Amy: Oh, she’s cute. And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.\\
79 - Raj: And judging by her lack of Adam’s apple, she’s been female her entire life. I like that in a woman.\\
80 - Amy: Great, so what do you need me for?\\
81 - Raj: Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first.\\
82 - Amy: All right.\\
83 - Raj: Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower.\\
84 - Amy: Wow.\\
85 - Raj: I know. Powerful stuff, huh?\\
86 - Amy: No. You’re supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy.\\
87 - Raj: Okay, I’m getting some mixed messages here.\\
88 - Amy: Just say something normal like, I saw your profile. Looks like we have a lot in common, let’s get a cup of coffee sometime.”\\
89 - Raj: Yes. Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. Or you just write it for me.\\
90 - Amy: I’m not gonna pretend to be you.\\
91 - Raj: I don’t want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my, uh, online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.\\
92 - Amy: Well, what would I say to her?\\
93 - Raj: Just tell her what I’m really like. And, if you think it’ll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own words.\\
94 - Scene: Penny’s car.\\
95 - Sheldon: Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.\\
96 - Penny: Oh, it’s no problem. Is everything okay?\\
97 - Sheldon: Oh, I’m fine. It’s just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip. There’s the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America.\\
98 - Penny: Remember the old days when I would’ve said something dumb like why? Uh, that doesn’t sound good.\\
99 - Sheldon: Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?\\
100 - Penny: Yes.\\
101 - Sheldon: Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny, your check engine…\\
102 - Penny: Yeah, I know it’s on, Sheldon. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I cannot afford this right now.\\
103 - Sheldon: Maybe it’s just something minor. Ooh, good news, the light just went out.\\
104 - Scene: The apartment. \\
105 - Leonard: Are we playing individual or teams?\\
106 - Raj: Teams are fun.\\
107 - Sheldon: Oh, in that case, I’d like to be partnered with my good friend Howard.\\
108 - Raj: But I’m always on Howard’s team. We’re best friends. The kind who finish each others…\\
109 - Howard: I really don’t think we do tha…\\
110 - Raj: Do that. See?\\
111 - Penny: Oh, hi.\\
112 - Leonard: Oh, how’d it go at the mechanic?\\
113 - Penny: Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?\\
114 - Leonard: Yeah, sure.\\
115 - Raj: Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?\\
116 - Howard: Isn’t it a little late to get plane tick…\\
117 - Raj: Plane tickets? Yeah.\\
118 - Howard: Will you please sto…\\
119 - Raj: Stop that? Okay.\\
120 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
121 - Penny: I don’t know what to do. My car threw a rod and it’s totaled. I can’t afford a new one, I have no job, and now I can’t drive to auditions.\\
122 - Leonard: I’m so sorry. I know it’s a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?\\
123 - Penny: I did. I called them. The part’s gone. They gave it to someone else. Now that girl’s gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.\\
124 - Leonard: At least they talked about you on Letterman. Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go.\\
125 - Penny: How? Unlike me, you have a job. I’m just gonna have to go back to being a waitress, like I will be for the rest of my life.\\
126 - Sheldon: Leonard, would you wrap it up? We’re waiting on you.\\
127 - Penny: I’m sorry, is the fact that my life’s falling apart interfering with your board game?\\
128 - Sheldon: It is. You were wrong, friend Howard. She completely understood.\\
129 - Scene: Amy’s lab.\\
130 - Raj: Hey, you busy?\\
131 - Amy: No. What’s up?\\
132 - Raj: Have you heard back from Emily?\\
133 - Amy: I have.\\
134 - Raj: Great. And?\\
135 - Amy: And I’m afraid she doesn’t think you’re right for her.\\
136 - Raj: I give you one simple thing to do, contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it.\\
137 - Amy: I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn’t write to her yourself. She thought it made you seem too shy and passive.\\
138 - Raj: I’m not too shy and passive. You write her back and tell her I said that. You know, when you have a second.\\
139 - Amy: Look, I’ll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.\\
140 - Raj: What’s happening tomorrow night?\\
141 - Amy: I’m meeting her for coffee.\\
142 - Raj: What?\\
143 - Amy: Well, we just, we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off.\\
144 - Raj: I find a girl I like, and you’re stealing her?\\
145 - Amy: No. We just ended up having a lot in common. We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we’re both hardcore into quilting.\\
146 - Raj: Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.\\
147 - Scene: Bernadette’s car.\\
148 - Howard: That’s Sheldon. He says he’ll be down in a minute.\\
149 - Bernadette: What are you doing?\\
150 - Howard: Oh, he’s not coming out until he sees proof you don’t have an air freshener in your car.\\
151 - Bernadette: This is gonna be a long weekend for you.\\
152 - Howard: You’re the reason I’m doing it.\\
153 - Bernadette: I said to stop insulting each other. I didn’t tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.\\
154 - Howard: How do I know what you said? Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.\\
155 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
156 - Bernadette: Hi.\\
157 - Howard: Hey, buddy.\\
158 - Bernadette: You excited for Texas?\\
159 - Sheldon: Oh, very much so.\\
160 - Howard: It’s not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.\\
161 - Sheldon: Oh, who’s the real astronaut?\\
162 - Howard: Buzz Aldrin.\\
163 - Sheldon: Oh. Yay.\\
164 - Scene: An airplane. \\
165 - Sheldon: (Tap, tap, tap) Howard? (Tap, tap, tap) Howard? (Tap, tap, tap) Howard?\\
166 - Howard: What now?\\
167 - Sheldon: I have to go to the bathroom.\\
168 - Howard: You just went to the bathroom.\\
169 - Sheldon: But I didn’t use it because it didn’t seem safe. Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn’t have a seatbelt.\\
170 - Howard: Well, it still doesn’t.\\
171 - Sheldon: I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago.\\
172 - Howard: Fine.\\
173 - Sheldon: Why are you getting annoyed?\\
174 - Howard: I’m trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things.\\
175 - Sheldon: Like when?\\
176 - Howard: When? How about in the car? I’m an astronaut, and you know it. You just don’t like admitting it, because you’re jealous.\\
177 - Sheldon: Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me.\\
178 - Howard: Thank you.\\
179 - Sheldon: Because it made me realize they’ll just send anyone up there. Aren’t you going to let me out?\\
180 - Howard: No.\\
181 - Sheldon: But I still need to use the bathroom.\\
182 - Howard: Here you go. Be creative. What’s the matter? Scared of a little turbulence?\\
183 - Sheldon: No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. I’m not scared at all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.\\
184 - Howard: Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one.\\
185 - Sheldon: I take it back. I’m scared of turbulence!\\
186 - Howard: I’m gonna need that bag back.\\
187 - Scene: Penny’s apartment. \\
188 - Leonard: You sure you want to do this?\\
189 - Penny: Yeah. Why wouldn’t I want to get my old job back? It’ll be fun to see everyone. I haven’t talked to them since I said I quit, see you at the Oscars, bitches. Come on, let’s just get this over with.\\
190 - Leonard: Let’s get this over with. Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having s*x? I’m just, I’m trying to lighten the mood.\\
191 - Penny: I know. Thank you.\\
192 - Leonard: Sorry.\\
193 - Penny: It’s just so humiliating.\\
194 - Leonard: So humiliating? Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory…? I’m sorry. I’ll. I’ll stop. I’ll stop.\\
195 - Scene: Outside the building. \\
196 - Leonard: Come on, don’t look so sad. You never know what’s gonna happen. Maybe tonight will be great.\\
197 - Penny: Sweetie, I know you’re trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it’s making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isn’t your car.\\
198 - Leonard: I know. I thought we’d take yours.\\
199 - Penny: I don’t understand.\\
200 - Leonard: It’s nothing fancy, but it’ll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don’t have to go back to waitressing.\\
201 - Penny: I don’t know what to say.\\
202 - Leonard: Don’t say anything.\\
203 - Penny: Oh, my God.\\
204 - Leonard: I mean, you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car.\\
205 - Scene: A coffee shop.\\
206 - Amy: Look, I admit that it’s odd that Rajesh didn’t write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you’ll see he’s just a sweet, regular guy. As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty.\\
207 - Raj: Hello, Emily.\\
208 - Emily: Hello.\\
209 - Raj: Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower, what’s up?\\
210 - Emily: No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might.\\
211 - Raj: Uh, okay, that’s a separate issue. Let’s put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.\\
212 - Emily: I’m leaving.\\
213 - Amy: Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?\\
214 - Emily: You know, I think I’m just gonna go by myself.\\
215 - Raj: Not my best first date. Yeah, but not my worst, either.\\
216 - Scene: The airplane.\\
217 - Sheldon: I’m sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you.\\
218 - Howard: I’m sorry, too. It’s all my fault.\\
219 - Sheldon: If you weren’t my friend, there’d be a hole in my life.\\
220 - Howard: Thank you, Sheldon.\\
221 - Sheldon: Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled. But not as big.\\
222 - Announcement: The captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign. You’re now free to move about the cabin.\\
223 - Howard: It’s over.\\
224 - Sheldon: Yeah.\\
225 - Howard: Should we stop holding hands now?\\
226 - Sheldon: In a minute.\\
227 - Howard: Okay, good.
\subsection {Episode 18: The Mommy Observation}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Amy: Should you really be sitting in Sheldon’s spot?\\
3 - Raj: He’s in Texas, he’ll never know.\\
4 - Penny: I wouldn’t be so sure about that.\\
5 - Leonard: Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it’s true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up.\\
6 - Raj: Have you heard from Howard?\\
7 - Bernadette: I did. His talk at NASA went great.\\
8 - Penny: Sheldon didn’t heckle him?\\
9 - Bernadette: No, in fact, he was so well-behaved, Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream.\\
10 - Stuart: Hey, guys.\\
11 - Amy: Oh, hi.\\
12 - Bernadette: Hi, Stuart.\\
13 - Raj: Hey, Stuart!\\
14 - Stuart: How’s it going?\\
15 - Raj: Good. Sheldon’s out of town, so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn’t like.\\
16 - Stuart: Oh, how is it?\\
17 - Penny: Disgusting. Do not tell him.\\
18 - Leonard: What do you guys want to do tonight?\\
19 - Amy: I don’t know.\\
20 - Bernadette: Well, I told Howie if I wasn’t busy, I’d spend the night at his mom’s. So for God’s sake, think of something.\\
21 - Raj: Stuart? Are you okay?\\
22 - Stuart: No, I don’t feel so…\\
23 - Leonard: Oh, my God, Stuart?\\
24 - Penny: Oh, my God, you guys need to do something!\\
25 - Raj: Stuart?\\
26 - Leonard: Calling 911.\\
27 - Raj: Well, it’s too late.\\
28 - Leonard: What do you mean it’s too late?\\
29 - Raj: He’s been murdered by someone in this room.\\
30 - Penny: Oh, my God.\\
31 - Leonard: Oh, come on.\\
32 - Raj: Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.\\
33 - Amy: I’m leaving.\\
34 - Raj: You can’t leave. You’re a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.\\
35 - Bernadette: I didn’t know his last name was Bloom.\\
36 - Amy: Yeah, it’s Bloom.\\
37 - Penny: Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?\\
38 - Stuart: What do you think I was gonna do at home?\\
39 - Credits sequence.\\
40 - Scene: The apartment.\\
41 - Penny: Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?\\
42 - Raj: Lame characters with silly ac…, what kind of actress are you?\\
43 - Penny: You’re right, I’m sorry. Sounds like fun.\\
44 - Raj: Thank you.\\
45 - Penny: That kind of actress. This sucks.\\
46 - Leonard: Come on, guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And that’s great. It’s not sad, it’s great.\\
47 - Amy: I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.\\
48 - Raj: Actually, you’re all just gonna be yourselves.\\
49 - Amy: Oh, ugh.\\
50 - Bernadette: All right, if I’m doing this, I’m playing to win, so just to be clear, if we’re ourselves, that means one of us killed Stuart?\\
51 - Raj: Very good, Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi.\\
52 - Bernadette: What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?\\
53 - Raj: Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?\\
54 - Amy: According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first.\\
55 - Raj: Great, everyone’s a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues.\\
56 - Penny: Got it. Hey, who’s the murderer?\\
57 - Raj: Any question but that.\\
58 - Penny: Sorry. Hey, who’s not the murderer?\\
59 - Stuart: Bernadette, can you not stand so close to me?\\
60 - Bernadette: What do you care? You’re dead.\\
61 - Stuart: Suit yourself. But I can kind of see up your skirt.\\
62 - Scene: A hire car.\\
63 - Sheldon: Thank you for my bobble head.\\
64 - Howard: Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.\\
65 - Sheldon: It wasn’t easy. Was it Buzz?\\
66 - Howard: We can’t show up to your mom’s empty-handed. We should bring something.\\
67 - Sheldon: I already am. I’m bringing the gift of knowledge.\\
68 - Howard: Oh, boy.\\
69 - Sheldon: Despite what her Bible says, recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn’t exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later.\\
70 - Howard: I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.\\
71 - Scene: The apartment. \\
72 - Bernadette: So, what happens next?\\
73 - Raj: I can’t tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.\\
74 - Penny: Ooh, I’m gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.\\
75 - Amy: Hey, I found something. It looks like a little man with a briefcase.\\
76 - Leonard: Oh, no, no. That’s Clarence Darrow. It’s from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system.\\
77 - Raj: Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun.\\
78 - Penny: Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?\\
79 - Raj: Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didn’t have any friends.\\
80 - Bernadette: I didn’t know you were fat.\\
81 - Raj: Yeah, I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it doesn’t help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that, that I would play those games with them.\\
82 - Amy: That is so sweet.\\
83 - Leonard: I’ve seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat kid.\\
84 - Raj: No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.\\
85 - Bernadette: Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt.\\
86 - Amy: What’s it for?\\
87 - Bernadette: For a cup of coffee. But it’s dated 20 years from now.\\
88 - Raj: From the future? How fun and imaginative.\\
89 - Leonard: So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart?\\
90 - Raj: Correct.\\
91 - Leonard: Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he’s just ripping off Terminator?\\
92 - Raj: Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?\\
93 - Leonard: Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?\\
94 - Penny: I’m gonna need another clue.\\
95 - Scene: Sheldon’s childhood home.\\
96 - Howard: Okay, give me the flowers and pie.\\
97 - Sheldon: But if we show up and you’re holding them, she’ll think they’re only from you.\\
98 - Howard: They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough.\\
99 - Sheldon: Yes, but now that I’ve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there’s no going back. Boy, I can’t wait to see the look on her face. We’re leaving right now.\\
100 - Howard: What’s wrong?\\
101 - Sheldon: Nothing.\\
102 - Howard: What? Sheldon, tell me what’s going on.\\
103 - Sheldon: I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.\\
104 - Scene: A bar in Texas.\\
105 - Howard: You ready to talk about it?\\
106 - Sheldon: I’m not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what it’s like to see your mother ravaging someone?\\
107 - Howard: Does a brisket count? I’m sorry, buddy, that’s rough. But didn’t she know we were coming?\\
108 - Sheldon: No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?\\
109 - Howard: Well, did she see you in the window?\\
110 - Sheldon: No.\\
111 - Howard: Then don’t say anything.\\
112 - Sheldon: I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don’t tell her how disappointed I am, and that I’ll never forgive her?\\
113 - Howard: Well, don’t do it on the phone.\\
114 - Sheldon: No, I’m just going to tell her I’m coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho.\\
115 - Howard: That’s some tough talk, I may need to cut you off.\\
116 - Sheldon: Yeah, maybe you better, I took a pretty big sip.\\
117 - Howard: Look, she’s a grown woman. And, and your dad’s been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business.\\
118 - Sheldon: I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote.\\
119 - Scene: The apartment.\\
120 - Raj: Okay, murder suspects, Leonard has found the time machine the killer must’ve used. You’re all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey, you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so bored.\\
121 - Penny: Well, my beer isn’t flat and my rack’s not saggy. So far, the future’s great.\\
122 - Stuart: Hey, can I go to the bathroom?\\
123 - Raj: Fine, just try not to look too alive.\\
124 - Stuart: That’s my jam.\\
125 - Bernadette: So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?\\
126 - Amy: But why?\\
127 - Raj: Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.\\
128 - Amy: Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the money to buy Stuart’s comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea.\\
129 - Penny: Hey, I’m a famous actress living in London.\\
130 - Leonard: Hmm, I’m a professor at Stanford.\\
131 - Penny: Hmm.\\
132 - Bernadette: So I guess you two are making it work long distance.\\
133 - Raj: Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna.\\
134 - Amy: What does your card say, Bernadette?\\
135 - Leonard: Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we’d really drift apart if we both became successful?\\
136 - Penny: Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me.\\
137 - Leonard: But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I might not have that much choice in where I end up.\\
138 - Penny: Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn’t need the money.\\
139 - Leonard: Well, you don’t go into science for the money.\\
140 - Bernadette: Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps.\\
141 - Penny: So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go?\\
142 - Amy: Dun, dun, dun. He started it.\\
143 - Raj: Okay, okay, guys, new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, you’re an actress, you’re a professor and you have three beautiful kids.\\
144 - Leonard: Great.\\
145 - Penny: Really? You think I’m putting this body through three kids?\\
146 - Scene: Sheldon’s childhood home.\\
147 - Sheldon: Okay, let’s do this.\\
148 - Howard: Good luck.\\
149 - Sheldon: You, aren’t you gonna come with me?\\
150 - Howard: While you confront your mother about her s*x life? I’d rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.\\
151 - Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Mother? (Knock, knock, knock) Mother? (Knock, knock, knock) Mother?\\
152 - Mrs Cooper: Shelly, I’m so glad you’re here.\\
153 - Sheldon: I saw you having naked s*x.\\
154 - Mrs Cooper: What are you talking about?\\
155 - Sheldon: Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man.\\
156 - Mrs Cooper: Oh, Shelly, I’m so sorry. Come in. Um, maybe we should sit down and talk about this.\\
157 - Sheldon: Can you recommend a surface you haven’t had coitus on?\\
158 - Mrs Cooper: That’s not funny. Maybe we should sit at the table. Well, I’m sure that, uh, you have a lot of questions.\\
159 - Sheldon: Who was he?\\
160 - Mrs Cooper: His name is Ron. I met him at my prayer group.\\
161 - Sheldon: How long have you been involved with him?\\
162 - Mrs Cooper: A few months.\\
163 - Sheldon: And of those few months, how long have you been a demented s*x pervert?\\
164 - Mrs Cooper: That is no way to speak to your mother.\\
165 - Sheldon: Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen’s finest sofas.\\
166 - Mrs Cooper: I will give you one opportunity, young man, to apologize.\\
167 - Sheldon: Or what?\\
168 - Mrs Cooper: Or I will send you to your room.\\
169 - Sheldon: That’s ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.\\
170 - Mrs Cooper: Go to your room.\\
171 - Sheldon: But I occupy the moral high ground.\\
172 - Mrs Cooper: Go to your room.\\
173 - Sheldon: But I’m a professional scientist.\\
174 - Mrs: Go to your room!\\
175 - Sheldon: I’m a grown man.\\
176 - Scene: The apartment.\\
177 - Raj: Can we please get back to the game?\\
178 - Leonard: In a minute. I don’t understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science.\\
179 - Penny: Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress, I’m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are.\\
180 - Amy: I’m surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.\\
181 - Leonard: Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?\\
182 - Amy: Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard.\\
183 - Penny: In 20 years, who knows what’ll happen with any of us?\\
184 - Stuart: I think you and Leonard will be together.\\
185 - Penny: You do?\\
186 - Stuart: Yeah. I think you’re the best couple I know.\\
187 - Leonard: Aw.\\
188 - Penny: That’s so sweet.\\
189 - Bernadette: What the hell?\\
190 - Amy: Excuse me?\\
191 - Penny: Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that?\\
192 - Stuart: Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better. Penny brought Leonard out of his shell. And it seems like Leonard makes Penny think more deeply about the world. I don’t know. Together, you two kind of make one awesome person.\\
193 - Penny: Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you.\\
194 - Raj: Oh, come on.\\
195 - Bernadette: Penny did it, I win. Suck it, jackasses.\\
196 - Scene: Sheldon’s old bedroom.\\
197 - Howard: Hey, can I come in?\\
198 - Sheldon: Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car.\\
199 - Howard: That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn’t go smoothly with your mom.\\
200 - Sheldon: No. I’m not sure how we’re going to get past this.\\
201 - Howard: You know, I, I sort of went through something like this myself.\\
202 - Sheldon: Howard, we’ve all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe.\\
203 - Howard: I’m talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left.\\
204 - Sheldon: I didn’t know she did.\\
205 - Howard: Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it.\\
206 - Sheldon: What did you do?\\
207 - Howard: Well, let’s just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she’s basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why.\\
208 - Sheldon: I’m sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why.\\
209 - Howard: All I’m saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom’s happiness.\\
210 - Sheldon: You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.\\
211 - Howard: And the healing begins.\\
212 - Scene: Mrs Cooper’s living room.\\
213 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
214 - Mrs Cooper: Hello. Are you ready to discuss this calmly, like adults?\\
215 - Sheldon: I am.\\
216 - Mrs Cooper: Shelly, I’m sorry that you saw what you saw. I know that this is hard for you.\\
217 - Sheldon: I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy. Doesn’t this contradict all the religious rules you’ve been espousing your whole life?\\
218 - Mrs Cooper: You’re right, it does, and it’s something that I’m struggling with these days.\\
219 - Sheldon: Then why are you doing it?\\
220 - Mrs Cooper: Because I’m not perfect, Shelly. And that man’s booty is.\\
221 - Sheldon: Well, this is confusing for me. But I don’t want to stand in the way of your happiness. So, I’ll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance.\\
222 - Mrs Cooper: That is very Christian of you.\\
223 - Sheldon: Mother, if you’re going to conduct your life in this fashion, then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. You know, it’s not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore.\\
224 - Mrs Cooper: How old do you think I am?\\
225 - Sheldon: My point is that you’re going to need to be careful. You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology, but now you’re going to need a stronger friend named latex.\\
226 - Mrs Cooper: Are you having the s*x talk with me?\\
227 - Sheldon: Well, someone has to.\\
228 - Mrs Cooper: Oh, dear Lord.\\
229 - Sheldon: No, don’t look to Him. He’s mad at you right now.\\
230 - Scene: The apartment.\\
231 - Penny: Oh, come on, don’t pout. I’m sorry I ruined your game.\\
232 - Raj: I’m not pouting, I’m brooding. Which is how sexy men pout.\\
233 - Amy: It actually was kind of fun.\\
234 - Raj: You’re just saying that.\\
235 - Amy: Yeah.\\
236 - Bernadette: I liked the time travel element.\\
237 - Raj: Thank you. I thought it was inspired.\\
238 - Leonard: It was. By Terminator.\\
239 - Bernadette: Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends.\\
240 - Penny: Definitely.\\
241 - Leonard: Of course. Well, hey, how about this? Whether we’re friends, not friends, scattered around the world, no matter what, let’s all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8:00 p.m. and have dinner like we always do.\\
242 - Bernadette: Aw.\\
243 - Penny: I love it.\\
244 - Leonard: Putting it in my phone right now.\\
245 - Penny: Yeah, me, too.\\
246 - Stuart: My phone doesn’t have a calendar. So I’ll just write it on my hand.\\
247 - Raj: And it’s done.\\
248 - Penny: Yup, we’re all in.\\
249 - Leonard: All right, I’ll see you guys in 20 years.\\
250 - Scene: In front of the building, 20 years later.\\
251 - Stuart: I knew it.
\subsection {Episode 19: The Indecision Amalgamation}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Sheldon: Boy, do I have to urinate.\\
3 - Leonard: If only there were a solution to that.\\
4 - Sheldon: Seriously. I feel like I’ve got a fish tank in my pelvis.\\
5 - Leonard: So go to the bathroom.\\
6 - Sheldon: I can’t.\\
7 - Leonard: Why not?\\
8 - Sheldon: Because I’m trying to decide between getting an Xbox One or a PS4. Oh, pee, why’d I say that?\\
9 - Leonard: Forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why are you being stupid?\\
10 - Sheldon: I’m not being stupid. I’m employing the work of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk, who found that people with full bladders make better decisions.\\
11 - Leonard: Why did I pee before I decided to move in here?\\
12 - Penny: Hi.\\
13 - Leonard: Hey. Oh, how’d the audition go?\\
14 - Penny: I killed it. I was even able to cry real tears right on the spot.\\
15 - Leonard: Oh, that’s great.\\
16 - Penny: I know. Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket, here come the waterworks.\\
17 - Sheldon: Here come the waterworks.\\
18 - Leonard: Aren’t you gonna ask?\\
19 - Penny: What is this, my first day?\\
20 - Credits sequence. \\
21 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
22 - Bernadette: Can I get your opinion on something that happened at work today?\\
23 - Penny: Yeah, sure.\\
24 - Amy: Of course.\\
25 - Bernadette: Okay, well, I did something that will either make me look like a lovable goof or a horrible monster damned to spend eternity in hell.\\
26 - Amy: I’m sure it’s lovable.\\
27 - Penny: I’m gonna go with monster. What do you got?\\
28 - Bernadette: Well, there’s this lady in our office who’s retiring, and they were passing around one of those big cards for us to sign.\\
29 - Amy: Okay.\\
30 - Bernadette: But no one told me she was in a horrible car accident over the weekend and what I was signing was not a retirement card but was actually a get well card.\\
31 - Penny: I’m liking my odds here.\\
32 - Bernadette: So on the card, in the hospital, next to the woman who’s clinging to life are the words, “Hey, Vivian. You deserve this. And at least with you gone, no one will steal my yoghurt out of the fridge.”\\
33 - Penny: No.\\
34 - Bernadette: “LOL.” Smiley face.\\
35 - Amy: Oh, my gosh.\\
36 - Bernadette: “P.S. Good luck wherever you wind up.”\\
37 - Penny: Oh. Why didn’t I put money on this? (Phone rings) Hey, that’s my agent. If I got the part, it’s still the second best thing I’ve heard all day. Hello?\\
38 - Bernadette: Am I a terrible person?\\
39 - Amy: No. No, it was a mistake.\\
40 - Bernadette: Am I a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?\\
41 - Amy: Now I think you’re flirting with the line. Good news?\\
42 - Penny: No, I didn’t get it.\\
43 - Bernadette: I’m so sorry.\\
44 - Amy: You’ll get offered something soon.\\
45 - Penny: I kind of did. The part in that awful horror movie I passed on came back around. Apparently, it’s mine if I want it.\\
46 - Bernadette: Are you gonna take it?\\
47 - Penny: I don’t know what to do.\\
48 - Amy: Maybe you’ll get hit by a car and die. LOL, right?\\
49 - Scene: A coffee shop.\\
50 - Raj: Hey. Emily, right?\\
51 - Emily: Yeah.\\
52 - Raj: I, I don’t know if you remember me.\\
53 - Emily: From the dating Web site. Your friend e-mailed me because you were afraid to, then you tracked me down and acted like a lunatic?\\
54 - Raj: Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali. Look, uh, I just, I wanted to say I’m sorry. Okay? You were, like, the coolest person I ever found online, and I got really nervous and I, I just blew it.\\
55 - Emily: Uh, don’t worry about it. And if it makes you feel any better, you’re not the weirdest guy I’ve met off the Internet.\\
56 - Raj: Well, give me a chance, you don’t even know me.\\
57 - Emily: All right, here’s your chance.\\
58 - Raj: Ah, really? Thank you. Fate has given me a rare second chance, and I swear to Vishnu I’m not gonna blow it. Or normal words followed by a charming smile.\\
59 - Scene: Amy’s apartment.\\
60 - Sheldon: So, first there was PlayStation, aka PS1, then PS2, PS3 and now PS4. And that makes sense. You’d think after Xbox, there’d be Xbox 2. But no, next came Xbox 360. Hmm? And now, after 360, comes Xbox One. Why one? Maybe that’s how many seconds of thought they put into naming it.\\
61 - Amy: Can you get the butter, please?\\
62 - Sheldon: You know, however, with the Xbox One, I can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands. Up until now, I’ve had to use Leonard.\\
63 - Amy: Then get the other one. Pass the butter.\\
64 - Sheldon: Get? Hang on. I don’t feel like you’re taking this dilemma seriously.\\
65 - Amy: Fine, Sheldon. You have my undivided attention.\\
66 - Sheldon: Okay, now, the PS4 is more angular and sleek-looking.\\
67 - Amy: No way.\\
68 - Sheldon: Yeah, well, it’s true. But the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating.\\
69 - Amy: Well, you wouldn’t want your gaming system to overheat.\\
70 - Sheldon: No, see? Well, you absolutely would not. And furthermore, the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included.\\
71 - Amy: Included?\\
72 - Sheldon: Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM, while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory.\\
73 - Amy: Why would they still be using DDR3? Are they nuts?\\
74 - Sheldon: See? That’s what I thought. But then they go and throw in an ESRAM buffer.\\
75 - Amy: Whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Who’s they?\\
76 - Sheldon: Xbox.\\
77 - Amy: You’re kidding.\\
78 - Sheldon: No, I am not. And this ESRAM buffer should totally bridge the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap between the two RAM types.\\
79 - Amy: This is a nightmare. How will you ever make a decision?\\
80 - Sheldon You see? I don’t know. What should I do?\\
81 - Amy: Please pass the butter!\\
82 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
83 - Penny: Okay, it’s not me, right? This script is terrible.\\
84 - Leonard: Yeah. I had higher hopes for a movie called Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill. You know, it’s still possible for you to be good in a bad movie.\\
85 - Penny: Okay. (Reading) Sometimes I feel like I can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me, but then I see these bananas and I just want to eat them and then kill people. What am I gonna do?\\
86 - Leonard: Well, for starters, I wouldn’t eat the bananas.\\
87 - Penny: No, come on. This is serious.\\
88 - Leonard: Uh, uh, does it at least pay well?\\
89 - Penny: Less than I was making at The Cheesecake Factory.\\
90 - Leonard: What does your agent think?\\
91 - Penny: She’s thinking of taking a job at The Cheesecake Factory.\\
92 - Leonard: You know what, why don’t you just do it? You’ll go have fun for a few weeks, make some money, and who knows what it might lead to?\\
93 - Penny: Okay, look, here, page 58. I oil-wrestle an orang-utan in a bikini.\\
94 - Leonard: Just to clarify, which one of you is wearing the bikini?\\
95 - Penny: Both of us.\\
96 - Leonard: So it’s a family film.\\
97 - Scene: Amy’s apartment. \\
98 - Sheldon: Thank you again for dinner.\\
99 - Amy: You’re welcome.\\
100 - Sheldon: Good night.\\
101 - Amy: Uh, it’s date night. Aren’t you, uh, forgetting something?\\
102 - Sheldon: Oh, of course. (They kiss) Did I mention the PS4 controllers light up?\\
103 - Amy: No.\\
104 - Sheldon: Well, they do.\\
105 - Scene: The apartment. \\
106 - Raj: And then after coffee, we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from India were exotic and mysterious. So, with my mouth, I said, we’re just like anybody else, but with my eyes, I said, straight up, Red, hop on my flying carpet.\\
107 - Leonard: So, are you gonna see her again?\\
108 - Raj: Yeah, we have plans this weekend. And if it’s a clear night, I’m gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her.\\
109 - Penny: Okay, like what? Show me.\\
110 - Raj: I can’t do that to Leonard. This is some powerful panty-dropping stuff.\\
111 - Leonard: You have my blessing. Go for it.\\
112 - Raj: Okay. Penny, two of the brightest stars in the night sky are Altair and Vega. And it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the Milky Way.\\
113 - Penny: Oh, that’s sad.\\
114 - Raj: It is. But once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, Vega cries so hard that all the magpies in the world fly up and create a bridge with their wings so the two lovers can be together for a single night of passion.\\
115 - Penny: Wow.\\
116 - Leonard: Okay, that’s enough.\\
117 - Sheldon: Quick poll, PS4 or Xbox One? Raj?\\
118 - Raj: Uh, Xbox One.\\
119 - Sheldon: Penny?\\
120 - Penny: Huh?\\
121 - Sheldon: Leonard?\\
122 - Leonard: PS4.\\
123 - Sheldon: Wolowitz?\\
124 - Howard: Both great.\\
125 - Sheldon: Bernadette?\\
126 - Bernadette: I like the Wii.\\
127 - Sheldon: Thanks, Grandma.\\
128 - Raj: Oh, my goodness.\\
129 - Leonard: What’s up?\\
130 - Raj: I just got an e-mail from my ex-girlfriend Lucy. She misses me and wants to get together.\\
131 - Leonard: Two women at the same time? Nice job, playa.\\
132 - Penny: Really?\\
133 - Leonard: Was it the two women thing or the playa? It was the playa.\\
134 - Scene: The same, later.\\
135 - Raj: What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to choose between Emily and Lucy?\\
136 - Howard: Why do you have to choose? Date both of them.\\
137 - Raj: I can’t date two women at once. Zero women, that’s my sweet spot.\\
138 - Penny: Unless you’re sleeping with one of them, seeing other people isn’t a big deal.\\
139 - Raj: But what if one of them asks me what I was up to the night before and I was with the other one? Then, what, do I lie?\\
140 - Howard and Bernadette (together): Yes.\\
141 - Bernadette: What do you mean, yes?\\
142 - Howard: What do you mean, yes?\\
143 - Bernadette: Were you seeing other women when we started dating?\\
144 - Howard: No. Were you seeing other men?\\
145 - Bernadette: No.\\
146 - Leonard: Were you seeing other men?\\
147 - Penny: No.\\
148 - Leonard: Aren’t you gonna ask me?\\
149 - Penny: Come on, really?\\
150 - Scene: A coffee shop.\\
151 - Leonard: Thank you so much for letting us pick your brain.\\
152 - Wil Wheaton: Yeah, happy to help. So, what’s going on?\\
153 - Penny: Well, I’m having an impossible time getting my career off the ground, and I got offered a role in this crappy horror movie, and I just don’t know if I should take it.\\
154 - Wil: Well, I have certainly taken some jobs that I’ve been embarrassed by.\\
155 - Penny: I wouldn’t exactly call Star Trek embarrassing.\\
156 - Wil: I wasn’t.\\
157 - Penny: Me, either.\\
158 - Leonard: So, what do you think, is there a professional downside to doing it?\\
159 - Wil: Well, it’s tricky. You want to take projects that you’re excited about, but sometimes you also have to pay the bills. When you’re on the set working on something that you just know in your heart is bad, not Star Trek.\\
160 - Penny: Yeah, beam me up. I love it.\\
161 - Wil: Anyway, those jobs can be soul-crushing.\\
162 - Penny: That’s what I’m afraid of.\\
163 - Wil: So, I was in Stand By Me when I was a kid, and it was a huge success. The terrible movies I did came after that. I mean, imagine how that feels.\\
164 - Leonard: Sounds rough.\\
165 - Wil: I’m telling you, this business is brutal. To this day, I hate going on auditions. Okay, I walk in, and I can just feel them thinking, he was such a cute kid, what happened to him? And then I don’t get the job, and I can never find out why. Honestly, I get so depressed, there are entire weeks that I can’t even get out of bed.\\
166 - Leonard: Okay, this was helpful.\\
167 - Scene: The stairwell.\\
168 - Raj: Any news on your co-worker who’s in the hospital?\\
169 - Bernadette: Poor thing, she was in surgery for 18 hours. She’s alive, but she’s still in critical condition.\\
170 - Raj: Oh, no.\\
171 - Bernadette: The one bit of good news is they put her in a medically induced coma before she read the card. So, you know, silver linings.\\
172 - Howard: Were you like this when I married you?\\
173 - Scene: The apartment. \\
174 - Leonard (on phone): Don’t worry about it, buddy. Okay, bye. That was Wil, he’s feeling a lot better. Apparently, he’s 12-down in the TV Guide crossword puzzle.\\
175 - Raj: Did he help you make a decision about the movie?\\
176 - Penny: No. Did you figure out what you’re gonna do about the two girls?\\
177 - Raj: As a matter of fact, I did. I’ve spent so many years living in fear, saying no to new experiences, but from now on, I’m gonna say yes, yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life. Whatever it may be, the answer’s going to be yes.\\
178 - Howard: He’s gonna die alone, right?\\
179 - Leonard: Yes.\\
180 - Penny: Yes.\\
181 - Bernadette: Yes.\\
182 - Scene: An electrical store.\\
183 - Amy: I’m proud of you, Sheldon.\\
184 - Sheldon: You know, I’m proud of me, too. I’ve done all my research, I conducted an informal poll, and I’ve arrived at the rock-solid certainty I’ve made the right choice.\\
185 - Amy: Well, that’s got to be a good feeling.\\
186 - Sheldon: Oh, it is. Although.\\
187 - Amy: Oh, crap.\\
188 - Sheldon: I had the same feeling when I made my dad buy a Betamax instead of a VHS.\\
189 - Amy: You were just a little kid.\\
190 - Sheldon: Yeah, a little kid who picked the wrong format to record The MacNeil/Lehrer Report. Now I also was certain that HD DVD would win out over Blu-ray.\\
191 - Amy: How old were you then?\\
192 - Sheldon: Old enough to know better. You know, and now that I think about it, I stood in front of a case of iPods and I bought a Zune.\\
193 - Amy: What’s a Zune?\\
194 - Sheldon: Yeah, exactly. It’s an MP3 player brought to us by the makers of Xbox.\\
195 - Amy: No, what are you doing? No, no, pick that back up. You know it’s good. You did the research.\\
196 - Sheldon: But what if I’m wrong?\\
197 - Amy: You know what? How about I buy it for you? How about I buy you both?\\
198 - Sheldon: You know I only have one slot available in my entertainment centre.\\
199 - Amy: Then I’ll buy you a new entertainment centre.\\
200 - Sheldon: Well, yeah, okay, sure. But which one?\\
201 - Amy: How about this? I’ve heard that if you flip a coin, it will tell you how you actually feel. Because you’ll either be disappointed or excited by the outcome.\\
202 - Sheldon: Interesting.\\
203 - Amy: So, heads it’s PS4, tails it’s Xbox One.\\
204 - Sheldon: All right, I’ll try.\\
205 - Amy: What is it?\\
206 - Sheldon: A quarter.\\
207 - Amy: Could have given it back to me. That was a choice.\\
208 - Scene: A restaurant.\\
209 - Raj: You look, you look really pretty tonight.\\
210 - Emily: Thanks. I love that jacket.\\
211 - Raj: Thank you. Thanks, thanks. I’m sorry. I can’t do this. My, my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me, and I’m seeing her Saturday, And I’m glad you like it, it’s from J. Crew.\\
212 - Emily: I don’t understand.\\
213 - Raj: My friends told me it was okay to see more than one person at a time, but it, it feels like I’m being deceitful.\\
214 - Emily: Are you getting back together with her?\\
215 - Raj: No. I, I have no idea. What would you do?\\
216 - Emily: Uh, usually on first dates, I talk about music and stuff, but I was promised weird, so let’s do this. How serious were you two?\\
217 - Raj: Well, to be honest, we only went on four dates, hugged twice, kissed once, and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo.\\
218 - Emily: Wait, so, a girl you never slept with sent you an e-mail and you felt so guilty about it that you had to tell me?\\
219 - Raj: Yeah.\\
220 - Emily: That’s kind of adorable.\\
221 - Raj: Are you, are you sure? Because this is the part of the night where I’ve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves.\\
222 - Emily: I’m still here.\\
223 - Raj: Yeah, but now you make me wonder what’s wrong with you.\\
224 - Emily: We just met. You don’t need to tell me about other people you’re seeing.\\
225 - Raj: Really? Because I’m dating two women is basically the only cool thing I can say about myself.\\
226 - Scene: The electrical store.\\
227 - Sheldon: On the one hand, the Xbox One has a better camera, but the PS4 has a removable hard drive. Thoughts?\\
228 - Amy: I can’t feel my legs.\\
229 - Store assistant: Oh, I’m sorry, guys, but the store closed five minutes ago.\\
230 - Sheldon: But I haven’t decided yet.\\
231 - Store assistant: You’ll have to come back tomorrow. The registers are closed.\\
232 - Amy: Let’s get you some food. You, You’ll feel better after you eat.\\
233 - Sheldon: Okay.\\
234 - Amy: What-what do you want, like, Thai food? A burger?\\
235 - Sheldon: I don’t know. Hey, look, a quarter.\\
236 - Scene: A film set. Penny is being fitted with gorilla hands.\\
237 - Costume guy: How’s that feel?\\
238 - Penny: Great. Not like regret at all.\\
239 - Wil: Penny? We’re working together. Awesome.
\subsection {Episode 20: The Relationship Diremption}
1 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
2 - Leonard: I got to tell you, the more I read about the primordial gravity wave discovery, the more excited I get.\\
3 - Raj: I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.\\
4 - Howard: Only without the s*x.\\
5 - Raj: Yeah, literally, none of it.\\
6 - Leonard: What do you think about it, Sheldon?\\
7 - Sheldon: Meh.\\
8 - Raj: Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?\\
9 - Sheldon: Maybe it’s because I’m not an elitist. What I’d like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Who’s looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?\\
10 - Leonard: Oh, my God, you’re jealous.\\
11 - Sheldon: Why would I be jealous?\\
12 - Leonard: Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the Higgs field just got proven, and you’ve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you’re no closer to proving it than when you started.\\
13 - Sheldon: Yeah, well, I’ve had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television.\\
14 - Barry: Excuse me, fewwas. Sowwy for eavesdwopping, but there actually was some big stwing theowy news today out of the Hadwon Cowwider.\\
15 - Sheldon: Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?\\
16 - Barry: No, but they did find evidence that you’ll bewieve anything.\\
17 - Sheldon: Why would you do that? You’re a string theorist as well.\\
18 - Barry: Incowwect. I am a stwing pwagmatist. I say I’m gonna pwove something that cannot be pwoved, I appwy for gwant money, and then I spend it on wiquor and bwoads. Water.\\
19 - Sheldon: Do you think he’s right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?\\
20 - Howard: Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?\\
21 - Credits sequence.\\
22 - Scene: The apartment.\\
23 - Penny: Hey, you’re up early.\\
24 - Sheldon: I couldn’t sleep.\\
25 - Penny: I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad idea.\\
26 - Sheldon: No, that’s not it.\\
27 - Penny: Is something bothering you?\\
28 - Sheldon: Yes, but you wouldn’t understand.\\
29 - Penny: Oh, come on, try me.\\
30 - Sheldon: All right. I’ve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. I’ve got nothing to show for it, and I feel like a fool.\\
31 - Penny: Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but I know what it’s like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it.\\
32 - Sheldon: You mean your acting career?\\
33 - Penny: No.\\
34 - Sheldon: Your relationship with Leonard?\\
35 - Penny: No.\\
36 - Sheldon: Your failed attempt to go back to college?\\
37 - Penny: No. I’m saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and I know what it’s like to be in one and realize it’s never gonna turn out the way you want.\\
38 - Sheldon: I said Leonard, you said no.\\
39 - Penny: I’m talking about other guys.\\
40 - Sheldon: Okay. Well, what do you do?\\
41 - Penny: You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away.\\
42 - Sheldon: I don’t know if I can do that.\\
43 - Penny: I know it’s hard, honey, but in the end, that’s how you grow.\\
44 - Leonard: Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?\\
45 - Sheldon: Break it off, shake hands, walk away.\\
46 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
47 - Leonard: Hey, how’s dating two women going?\\
48 - Raj: Um, kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn’t the only person I was seeing, it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy.\\
49 - Howard: And?\\
50 - Raj: She had mixed feelings. But when I said, Emily was cool with it. Emily’s the best. Why can’t you\\
51 - be more like Emily? Those feelings became less mixed.\\
52 - Leonard: Women. Who knows what’ll set ‘em off?\\
53 - Raj: At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.\\
54 - Howard: I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible.\\
55 - Raj: Why the rush? She isn’t going anywhere.\\
56 - Howard: She is. But I like that attitude.\\
57 - Sheldon: Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?\\
58 - Raj: You’re really going to do this?\\
59 - Sheldon: I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out that what I’m going through is essentially a breakup. And according to Cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship.\\
60 - Howard: You’re reading Cosmo?\\
61 - Sheldon: Yes. As it turns out, there’s an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway, it suggests that I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas.\\
62 - Howard: What’s this?\\
63 - Sheldon: Oh, that’s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.\\
64 - Leonard: Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?\\
65 - Sheldon: It was. This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places.\\
66 - Raj: It’s going to be okay.\\
67 - Sheldon: I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I can’t keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too.\\
68 - Howard: So, you and Emily still together?\\
69 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
70 - Howard: I spoke to Bernadette. She’s free tomorrow night.\\
71 - Raj: Oh, okay, great. But if we’re really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily.\\
72 - Howard: Like when it turns out she’s made of rubber, I don’t say anything?\\
73 - Raj: She’s very real.\\
74 - Howard: Oh, that’s what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe.\\
75 - Raj: See? This is exactly the kind of thing I’m worried about you saying in front of her.\\
76 - Howard: I promise I’ll be on my best behaviour.\\
77 - Raj: You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.\\
78 - Howard: You got it.\\
79 - Raj: No jokes about the year I took ballet.\\
80 - Howard: You took ballet?\\
81 - Raj: God, you never listen.\\
82 - Scene: The apartment.\\
83 - Leonard: Are you sure you want to do this?\\
84 - Sheldon: The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.\\
85 - Leonard: What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?\\
86 - Penny (treating Sheldon as a ventriloquist doll): Oh my God, I do look like that.\\
87 - Sheldon: You stop it.\\
88 - Penny: So, how do you want me to cut it?\\
89 - Sheldon: Oh, how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?\\
90 - Leonard: So, business in the front, science in the back.\\
91 - Penny: Or I don’t cut it and maybe just style it a little.\\
92 - Sheldon: Oh, I’m in your hands. Do a good job and I’ll tell you Cosmo’s ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS.\\
93 - Penny: Can you keep him quiet? Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?\\
94 - Leonard: That doesn’t work any more. He just thinks I’m taking him to the doctor. So, now that you’re no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?\\
95 - Sheldon: Oh, there are so many exciting areas. Black holes, dark matter.\\
96 - Penny: Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn’t really understand it.\\
97 - Sheldon: Don’t feel bad. Neither does he.\\
98 - Penny: Okay, what do you think?\\
99 - Sheldon: Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?\\
100 - Leonard: It actually looks good, Sheldon.\\
101 - Penny: Doesn’t it?\\
102 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
103 - Sheldon: I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course, I’d be the dreamy one and the smart one.\\
104 - Amy: Sorry I’m late. What did you do?\\
105 - Penny: I gave him a new look. It’s cute, huh?\\
106 - Amy: Yeah, it’s cute. That’s the problem. I don’t need other girls to see him walking around like s*x on a stick.\\
107 - Sheldon: She’s right. I’m too hot.\\
108 - Scene: A restaurant.\\
109 - Bernadette: I’m excited to meet Emily.\\
110 - Howard: Me, too. I just hope he doesn’t blow it.\\
111 - Bernadette: Why would you say that?\\
112 - Howard: Because he’s Raj, that’s his thing. Beckham can bend it, Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it. Look, I don’t want it to happen, but odds are he’s gonna find a way to… Oh, crap, I know that girl.\\
113 - Bernadette: How?\\
114 - Howard: In a bad way, very bad.\\
115 - Raj: Hey, guys.\\
116 - Howard: Whatever you hear tonight, just remember I love you. Hey.\\
117 - Raj: Emily, these are my good friends, Howard and Bernadette. Guys, this is Emily.\\
118 - Emily: Nice to meet you.\\
119 - Bernadette: Hi.\\
120 - Emily: Have we met before?\\
121 - Howard: Uh, no. I, I don’t, I don’t think so.\\
122 - Emily: You sure? You look familiar.\\
123 - Howard: Well, you sure don’t. You I know, you I know, you? Total stranger. Even if you had yummy candy, I would not get in your van.\\
124 - Emily: Did you go to that spin class on Green Street?\\
125 - Howard: That must be it.\\
126 - Raj: Since when do you go to spin class?\\
127 - Howard: Wow. Now who doesn’t listen?\\
128 - Scene: The apartment.\\
129 - Amy: Sheldon, your food’s getting cold. What are you doing?\\
130 - Sheldon: Oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. Why do we have a geology book? Leonard, did you throw a children’s party while I was in Texas?\\
131 - Penny: Wait. What’s wrong with geology?\\
132 - Sheldon: Let me put this in a way you’ll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren’t real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science.\\
133 - Sheldon: Have you considered studying standard model physics?\\
134 - Sheldon: You want me to give up string theory for something that’s less advanced? You know, why don’t you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear?\\
135 - Penny: Like you could get a brown bear.\\
136 - Leonard: Hey, I’ve got a good job. I could buy salmon. You don’t know.\\
137 - Amy: Maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.\\
138 - Sheldon: Oh, please. If I wanted to take up a fad, I’d get a tramp stamp.\\
139 - Leonard: What about loop quantum gravity?\\
140 - Sheldon: Oh, Duchess, look at me. My quantum gravity’s positively loopy.\\
141 - Penny: Who’s the duchess?\\
142 - Leonard: One of the people that lives in his head.\\
143 - Amy: I hope he’s this distraught if he ever breaks up with me.\\
144 - Leonard: Well, if he does, I’ll see if my bear has a friend.\\
145 - Penny: Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why don’t you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you.\\
146 - Sheldon: That’s actually not bad advice. You know, I didn’t seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day.\\
147 - Amy: How does that happen?\\
148 - Sheldon: A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.\\
149 - Penny: Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?\\
150 - Sheldon: Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that’s been predigested by a fungus?\\
151 - Penny: And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!\\
152 - Scene: The restaurant.\\
153 - Bernadette: Emily, what do you do?\\
154 - Emily: I’m a dermatology resident at Huntington Hospital.\\
155 - Raj: Mmm, and you know what that means. Someone’s skin’s about to be softer than ever.\\
156 - Emily: This is making me crazy. I know I know you from somewhere.\\
157 - Raj: Oh, uh, Howard was an astronaut. Maybe that’s where you saw him.\\
158 - Emily: Wow. That’s amazing. What was that like?\\
159 - Howard: It was the most incredible experience of my life. Up there in the space station, you’re…\\
160 - Emily: Oh, my God, I remember.\\
161 - Howard: Can I finish my astronaut story?\\
162 - Emily: It was four years ago.\\
163 - Howard: Please don’t say it.\\
164 - Emily: We were set up on a blind date.\\
165 - Howard: Please don’t say it.\\
166 - Emily: You came to my apartment.\\
167 - Howard: You’re saying it.\\
168 - Raj: Wh, what happened?\\
169 - Bernadette: Yeah, what happened?\\
170 - Howard: Okay, I’ll say it. I was on the way to pick her up. My stomach felt a little funny. When I got there, I asked if I could use her bathroom.\\
171 - Bernadette: Please don’t say it.\\
172 - Howard: One roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later, I was so humiliated, I snuck out the window and never saw her again.\\
173 - Emily: You know what else I never saw again, my security deposit.\\
174 - Howard: I’m sorry. I tried to unclog it, but you didn’t have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere.\\
175 - Emily: Right, just water.\\
176 - Howard: Look, I have felt terrible about this for years, and I’m glad I have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry I am.\\
177 - Emily: It’s fine. All my friends love this story. They call you Clogzilla.\\
178 - Raj: Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!\\
179 - Howard: Yeah, yeah, I get it.\\
180 - Bernadette: Howie.\\
181 - Howard: Well, hey, it’s not like cotton candy comes out of you.\\
182 - Scene: The apartment.\\
183 - Amy: Come on, let’s get you to bed. You’ve had a lot to drink.\\
184 - Sheldon: No more than Penny.\\
185 - Amy: That’s what I’m saying.\\
186 - Sheldon: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. If somebody says come in, I’m gonna freak out.\\
187 - Scene: The restaurant.\\
188 - Bernadette: So, Emily, why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?\\
189 - Emily: I like cutting people with knives, and all the other jobs where you get to do that are illegal.\\
190 - Bernadette: You’re kidding, right?\\
191 - Raj: She’s scary, but it’s a cute scary.\\
192 - Howard: Can I say just one more thing? I had some kind of food poisoning that day. Sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. Nor was climbing out your window and running away. But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and I’d really appreciate it if we could move on.\\
193 - Bernadette: Howie, we moved on a long time ago.\\
194 - Howard: I’m just saying…\\
195 - Bernadette: We moved on.\\
196 - Howard: Okay. Fine.\\
197 - Bernadette: How’s your soup?\\
198 - Howard: Ah, it’s all right. They could’ve filled the bowl a little more. Excuse me.\\
199 - Bernadette: Where are you going?\\
200 - Howard: I need some fresh air.\\
201 - Emily: Been there.\\
202 - Scene: Sheldon, waking up in bed next to a Geology book.\\
203 - Sheldon: Oh, no. What have I done?\\
204 - Scene: The apartment.\\
205 - Leonard: How you feeling?\\
206 - Sheldon: Not so good.\\
207 - Leonard: Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?\\
208 - Sheldon: It’s not my friend. Nothing happened.\\
209 - Leonard: I don’t know. I heard you reading pretty loud last night.\\
210 - Sheldon: Oh, dear Lord. Where’s Amy?\\
211 - Leonard: After she put you to bed, she went home.\\
212 - Sheldon: Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh, no.\\
213 - Leonard: What?\\
214 - Sheldon: Apparently, I called Stephen Hawking last night.\\
215 - Scene: Stephen Hawking’s office.\\
216 - Answerphone: First new message.\\
217 - Sheldon (voice): Hawkman. It’s your old buddy Sheldonoscopy. How come you didn’t pick up the phone? Oh, right. My bad.\\
218 - Scene: The cafeteria..\\
219 - Howard: You’re awful quiet. Everything okay?\\
220 - Sheldon: Not really. I had a bit of an embarrassing evening.\\
221 - Howard: Ugh. Me, too. What happened?\\
222 - Sheldon: I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking.\\
223 - Howard: I wouldn’t worry about it. He’s got a pretty good sense of humour.\\
224 - Sheldon: Oh, I hope so. What happened to you last night?\\
225 - Howard: Oh, well, turns out I’d already met the girl Raj is seeing when I did a number on her bathroom. And that number was two.\\
226 - Sheldon: Well, you know, I’ve always been a fan of a story told by Attar of Nishapur, about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad. And that ring was inscribed with the phrase, this too shall pass.\\
227 - Barry: Hey, Cooper. I heard you dwunk-dialed Stephen Hawking last night? Classic.\\
228 - Howard: Get out of here, Barry.\\
229 - Barry: Whatever you say, Cwogziwwa.\\
230 - Sheldon: Clogzilla. That’s pretty funny. I don’t think that’s gonna pass.\\
231 - Scene: Stephen Hawking’s office.\\
232 - Answerphone: Next message.\\
233 - Sheldon (voice): It’s me again. I gave up string theory. You should give up black holes, and we can totally solve crimes together.\\
234 - Answerphone: Next message.\\
235 - Sheldon (voice): Do you know what’s great? Geology. Oh. Look at this geode. That’s fun to say. Gee-ode. Gee-ode.\\
236 - Answerphone: Next message.\\
237 - Sheldon (voice): Gee-ode. Gee-ode. I kiss girls now.\\
238 - Answerphone: Next message.\\
239 - Sheldon (voice): Hey, guess who I am. Beep bop boop bop. I’m you. Get it?\\
240 - Answerphone: Next message.\\
241 - Sheldon (voice): Are you mad at me? Oh, no, you’re mad at me. I’m so sorry. Beep bop boop bop.\\
242 - Answerphone: Next message.\\
243 - Sheldon (voice): Thiospinel sulfide. Thiospinel sulfide. That’s even more fun than gee-ode. Hey, did you see The Lego Movie?\\
244 - Stephen Hawking: What a jackass.
\subsection {Episode 21: The Anything Can Happen Recurrence}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Penny: So, we’re about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body.\\
3 - Leonard: Okay.\\
4 - Penny: But I realize they’re gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage. So, I asked the director why and he says, it’s important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape.\\
5 - Leonard: It’s sweet that he thinks there’s a story.\\
6 - Penny: Oh, and there’s not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean, I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there.\\
7 - Sheldon: Leonard, I could use your assistance.\\
8 - Leonard: Sure. What’s up?\\
9 - Sheldon: Well, now that I’ve given up string theory, I’m struggling to find my next area of focus. So, in your professional opinion, which of these areas do you think is the most promising?\\
10 - Leonard: Huh, well, I think there’s some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter.\\
11 - Sheldon: That’s helpful. Okay. Of these four areas…\\
12 - Penny: Sheldon, what did we say about being a nicer friend?\\
13 - Leonard: Thank you.\\
14 - Penny: Leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?\\
15 - Sheldon: It is just so frustrating.\\
16 - Penny: ‘Cause you’re trying too hard. You need to do something else, get your mind off it.\\
17 - Leonard: Hey. How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?\\
18 - Penny: Hey, that’s good. Why’d you guys stop doing that?\\
19 - Leonard: You made fun of us. Said it was stupid.\\
20 - Penny: Yeah. Sounds like me. Come on, Sheldon. What do you say?\\
21 - Sheldon: All right. I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday.\\
22 - Leonard: Great, what do you want to do?\\
23 - Sheldon: I don’t know. What do you want to do?\\
24 - Penny: I don’t know. What do you want to do?\\
25 - Leonard: I’m starting to remember the problem with Anything Can Happen Thursdays.\\
26 - Credits sequence.\\
27 - Scene: The apartment.\\
28 - Sheldon: Hmm, what can we do that’s fun?\\
29 - Leonard: What can we do that’s different?\\
30 - Penny: What can we do that’s free?\\
31 - Sheldon: Oh, got it. We order a pizza.\\
32 - Penny: Are you kidding? That’s what you always do. Think harder.\\
33 - Sheldon: You’re right. You’re right. Got it. We order calzones, cut them open, eat them like pizza. All right, all right, I’ll shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out. Got it. There’s a live-action role-playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings.\\
34 - Penny: Uh, tell me more about this calzone idea.\\
35 - Leonard: You know what? Why don’t we just ease into this. Let, let’s go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new restaurant.\\
36 - Sheldon: Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park?\\
37 - Leonard: No.\\
38 - Sheldon: All right.\\
39 - Leonard: Raj and Howard are at Howard’s mom’s, but should we call the girls and see if they want to come?\\
40 - Penny: No. Bernadette’s working late.\\
41 - Sheldon: Amy’s sick.\\
42 - Leonard: Aw. What’s wrong with her?\\
43 - Sheldon: Well, she talks a lot. She always wants to hold hands.\\
44 - Leonard: That’s not what I meant.\\
45 - Sheldon: Well, if you were referring to her illness your question should have been, what ails her?\\
46 - Leonard: What ails her?\\
47 - Sheldon: Oh. Who knows?\\
48 - Penny: Come on, anything can happen. We can push him down the stairs.\\
49 - Scene: Howard’s mother’s house.\\
50 - Howard: Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.\\
51 - Raj: No problem. How’s your mom feeling?\\
52 - Howard: Okay, but she’d feel better if she took her medicine.\\
53 - Raj: You know, when Cinnamon won’t take her medicine, I hide it in a piece of cheese.\\
54 - Howard: Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon, and then my mom can eat Cinnamon. So what do you feel like doing?\\
55 - Raj: I was thinking we could watch a DVD.\\
56 - Howard: Well, my mom doesn’t have a lot to choose from. Unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy. Spoiler alert, 20 minutes in they find a prune pit.\\
57 - Raj: Actually, how do you feel about watching House of 1000 Corpses?\\
58 - Howard: A straight-up gore-fest? You hate this stuff.\\
59 - Raj: I do, but for some reason, Emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow, so I thought if I start with you first, then I could act cool about it with her.\\
60 - Howard: That’s actually not a bad plan. I can sit through the colonoscopy now, but that first time I was like, oh my God, a prune pit.\\
61 - Raj: Uh, so, you’ll watch it?\\
62 - Howard: Sure.\\
63 - Raj: You’re a good friend. I owe you one.\\

67 - Sheldon: So, we’re just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online?\\
68 - Penny: Yep.\\
69 - Sheldon: Great. You know, this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into It Won’t Stop Coming Up Friday.\\
70 - Leonard: Hey, how about that Asian fusion place?\\
71 - Sheldon: Fusion and Asians? I’m trying not to think about science.\\
72 - Penny: What the hell? What? She’s not working late.\\
73 - Sheldon: And Amy doesn’t look sick.\\
74 - Penny: Why would they lie to us?\\
75 - Sheldon: That’s a good question. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. Why did you lie to us?\\
76 - Scene: Howard’s mother’s house.\\
77 - Raj: Hey. Listen to this. Murder, cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await.\\
78 - Howard: I just helped my mom out of the tub, so, I’m one slippery horror ahead of you.\\
79 - Raj: You’re a good son. I don’t know how you do it.\\
80 - Howard: Beach blankets, my friend, it’s all about beach blankets.\\
81 - Raj: All right, let’s get this over with. Ew, it’s got someone’s hair on it.\\
82 - Howard: Oh, yeah, you’re gonna do great with this movie.\\
83 - Scene: A bar.\\
84 - Penny: You’re not working late. Why did you lie to me?\\
85 - Sheldon: And Amy, you told me you were sick, but you look just as pale and tired as always.\\
86 - Amy: I’m sorry, I just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory.\\
87 - Bernadette: We kind of just wanted one night where we didn’t have to hear about how miserable you are making this movie.\\
88 - Amy: But none of that means we don’t love you.\\
89 - Penny: I haven’t been complaining that much about the movie. Have I?\\
90 - Leonard: I also love you.\\
91 - Penny: Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from all of you. Come on, Sheldon.\\
92 - Sheldon: Where are we going?\\
93 - Penny: We’re gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday, you’re gonna tell me all about your science stuff and I’m gonna complain about my movie, and we’re gonna support each other because that’s what friends do.\\
94 - Sheldon: Okay. ‘Cause if I had to pick now, I’d probably go with dark matter because…\\
95 - Penny: Shut up.\\
96 - Scene: A restaurant. Sheldon makes an “unsure” noise.\\
97 - Penny: What’s wrong?\\
98 - Sheldon: I don’t understand my food. Chinese noodles with Korean barbecue in a taco.\\
99 - Penny: It’s fusion.\\
100 - Sheldon: My mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity.\\
101 - Penny: Think I’ve been complaining too much about the movie?\\
102 - Sheldon: Not at all.\\
103 - Penny: Thank you.\\
104 - Sheldon: But to be fair, when you talk, most of what you say sounds like, wah, wah, wah, clothes, wah, wah, wah.\\
105 - Penny: Hey, I don’t understand why you’re not upset with Amy.\\
106 - Sheldon: I am. So much so that I’m gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night.\\
107 - Scene: Howard’s mother’s house.\\
108 - Raj: Okay. So, in the last 20 minutes, we’ve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. We’ve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish.\\
109 - Howard: And the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.\\
110 - Raj: On the bright side, she didn’t even notice the pill. Why does Emily like this stuff? Do you think there’s something psychologically wrong with her?\\
111 - Howard: What difference does it make?\\
112 - Raj: What do you mean?\\
113 - Howard: Oh, come on, she could have a freezer full of ex-boyfriend’s body parts and you’d still go out with her.\\
114 - Raj: I do like that the ex-boyfriend’s out of the picture.\\
115 - Scene: The bar.\\
116 - Amy: I feel so bad about lying to Sheldon. How am I gonna make it up to him?\\
117 - Bernadette: I’d tell you what I do with Howard, but I don’t think dressing up like a Catholic schoolgirl is gonna work with Sheldon.\\
118 - Leonard: He’d probably give you homework.\\
119 - Amy: Did you lie to Howard about tonight?\\
120 - Bernadette: Of course.\\
121 - Amy: And you don’t feel guilty about it?\\
122 - Bernadette: Between Penny’s gorilla movie and Howard’s gorilla mother, I had no choice.\\
123 - Leonard: Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty. What? I don’t lie to her.\\
124 - Bernadette: Oh, we know you don’t lie to her.\\
125 - Scene: The restaurant.\\
126 - Penny: Thank you. Hey, maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these.\\
127 - Sheldon: Penny, there’s only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life’s problems, and that’s an Oreo. Or a Nutter Butter, if you’re in a pinch.\\
128 - Penny: Come on, open it. I bet it says something great.\\
129 - Sheldon: This is Asian fusion. For all you know, there’s a tiny Chihuahua in here.\\
130 - Penny: Fine, I’ll go. Hmm. People turn to you for guidance and wisdom. Yeah, that’s a good one.\\
131 - Sheldon: No, it’s not.\\
132 - Penny: How is that not good?\\
133 - Sheldon: Turn to you for wisdom? Clearly, that cookie is mocking you. You’d never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter.\\
134 - Penny: Uh, since you’re paying for dinner, I’ll let that slide. Open yours.\\
135 - Sheldon: Have you ever paid for a meal?\\
136 - Penny: Not with money. Read.\\
137 - Sheldon: Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you.\\
138 - Penny: Oh, try again.\\
139 - Scene: Howard’s mother’s house. \\
140 - Howard: Let me get this straight. So, he kills this girl’s father, cuts off the guy’s face, and is wearing it as a mask while he makes out with her.\\
141 - Raj: I’m just gonna say it. That’s not okay. Why can’t I be in a relationship with a girl who likes The Sound of Music?\\
142 - Howard: Raj, you are the girl in the relationship who likes The Sound of Music. (Phone rings) Hey, Penny. What’s up? No, Bernie’s working late. Really? Thanks for telling me.\\
143 - Raj: What?\\
144 - Howard: I’m having s*x with a Catholic schoolgirl tonight.\\
145 - Scene: The street. Outside a psychic’s shop.\\
146 - Penny: Oh, I think I see our next stop.\\
147 - Sheldon: You can’t be serious. If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense, I’d follow Leonard on Instagram.\\
148 - Penny: No, come on, tonight we are trying new things.\\
149 - Sheldon: Oh. That’s a lot of incense. Or someone set a hippie on fire.\\
150 - Scene: Outside the bar.\\
151 - Bernadette (on phone): Yeah, honey, I’m still stuck at work. Really? Penny said that? Okay, it’s true. I’m sorry. I’ll see you at home. Yeah, yeah, I’ll put it on.\\
152 - Leonard: You and I never just hang out like this. Why is that?\\
153 - Amy: I know, it’s weird, right?\\
154 - Leonard: Yeah. We should do it more often.\\
155 - Amy: Oh, no. I mean, this is weird right now.\\
156 - Leonard: (Phone text sound) Ah, it’s Penny.\\
157 - Amy: Is she still mad?\\
158 - Leonard: Oh, doesn’t seem like it. She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her.\\
159 - Amy: A psychic? He considers them not just mumbo jumbo, but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo.\\
160 - Leonard: Well, Penny can be very persuasive. She’s gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldn’t normally do.\\
161 - Amy: Because she has s*x with you.\\
162 - Leonard: Yeah, she does.\\
163 - Amy: Can I confess something? Once in a while, I get a little jealous of how close Penny and Sheldon are.\\
164 - Leonard: Really?\\
165 - Amy: I mean, not in a romantic way. It’s just, she really has some sort of connection with him.\\
166 - Leonard: Well, well they’ve known each other a long time, and Penny grew up around horses, so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish.\\
167 - Amy: Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad they’re friends. I just wish he’d be that comfortable around me already.\\
168 - Leonard: Well, it took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too.\\
169 - Amy: Really? What did you do?\\
170 - Leonard: Something terrible in a former life? I don’t know.\\
171 - Bernadette: I gotta go. Penny ratted me out. FYI, she’s getting you a watch for your birthday with money she took out of your wallet.\\
172 - Scene: The psychic shop.\\
173 - Sheldon: I don’t mean to be rude or discourteous, but before we begin, I’d just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. Which means, and again, no insult intended, that you’re a fraud, your profession is a swindle, and, uh, your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people. Again, no offence.\\
174 - Penny: All right, Sheldon, just ask your question.\\
175 - Sheldon: Okay, I just did. What was it?\\
176 - Penny: Oh, for God’s sake. Look, he’s a physicist who’s trying to figure out what his next field of study should be.\\
177 - Sheldon: For your information, I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie.\\
178 - Penny: Okay, I can answer that one, I’ll be bored.\\
179 - Psychic: All right, why don’t we begin? Your spirit guides are telling me that there’s a woman in your life you’re having problems with.\\
180 - Sheldon: That’s an easy guess. I’m clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders.\\
181 - Psychic: Yes, you clearly are. But I’m seeing a specific woman that you’re in a romantic relationship with.\\
182 - Penny: Oh, oh, here we go.\\
183 - Psychic: Does she have dark hair?\\
184 - Penny: Yes, yes, your spirit guides are on fire.\\
185 - Sheldon: The majority of people have dark hair. Even you, at one time.\\
186 - Psychic: Does she work in a similar field to you?\\
187 - Sheldon: Ha. The opposite. She’s a neurobiologist, and I’m a theoretical physicist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg.\\
188 - Psychic: They’re telling me that you have difficulty being close with her.\\
189 - Penny: Oh, he does. He so does. What should he do?\\
190 - Psychic: He should give himself to this relationship. Once he does, all his other pursuits will come into focus.\\
191 - Penny: Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean, Amy is the key to your happiness.\\
192 - Psychic: Exactly. Personally and professionally. Everything will fall into place once you commit to her.\\
193 - Sheldon: You know what this is? Yeah, and I reserve this word for those rare instances when it’s truly deserved. This is malarkey.\\
194 - Penny: Wow, you really struck a nerve. I’ve never heard him use the M word before.\\
195 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
196 - Raj: Here we go, House of a 1,000 Corpses.\\
197 - Emily: Now, just so you know, I was a nanny for three years, so if you get scared, I can totally change your diaper.\\
198 - Raj: Actually, I have to tell you something. These kind of movies really aren’t my thing, so, last night, I watched it just to see what I was getting myself into.\\
199 - Emily: Okay.\\
200 - Raj: And I have to be honest, I thought it was disturbing and weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it.\\
201 - Emily: I wonder that, too.\\
202 - Raj: Then, why do you watch these things?\\
203 - Emily: Can I tell you something without you judging me?\\
204 - Raj: Sure.\\
205 - Emily: They kind of turn me on.\\
206 - Raj: And play.\\
207 - Scene: The apartment.\\
208 - Sheldon: Hello. I didn’t expect you this evening.\\
209 - Amy: Well, I was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night, I wanted to make it up to you.\\
210 - Sheldon: And how do you propose to do that? (Amy takes off coat and is dressed as a Catholic schoolgirl) Unless you have Gravity on Blu-ray under that skirt, I don’t know where you’re going with this.
\subsection {Episode 22: The Proton Transmogrification}
1 - Scene: The apartment.\\
2 - Sheldon: Gentlemen, Star Wars Day is rapidly approaching. We should finalize our plans.\\
3 - Penny: What? That’s a real thing? What is it, Star Wars Christmas?\\
4 - Howard: No. Don’t be ridiculous. That’s Wookiee Life Day.\\
5 - Penny: So, when is it?\\
6 - Leonard: Uh, well, it’s not May the fifth, and it’s not May the third. It’s May the fourth.\\
7 - Sheldon: Get it?\\
8 - Raj: May the fourth be with you?\\
9 - Leonard: May the force be with you. Get it?\\
10 - Penny: Oh, no. This face wasn’t because I didn’t get it.\\
11 - Credits sequence.\\
12 - Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom. There is a knock on the door.\\
13 - Sheldon: Come in.\\
14 - Leonard: Hey, you got a second?\\
15 - Sheldon: Yes. Actually, I’m glad you’re here. I’m working on the Star Wars Day schedule. Now, I have a window built in after Phantom Menace for complaining, but I’m worried an hour won’t be enough time.\\
16 - Leonard: Sheldon, I’ve got some bad news.\\
17 - Sheldon: What is it?\\
18 - Leonard: I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away.\\
19 - Sheldon: Professor Proton is dead?\\
20 - Leonard: Sorry, buddy.\\
21 - Sheldon: What are you doing?\\
22 - Leonard: Comforting you?\\
23 - Sheldon: Your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly aren’t.\\
24 - Leonard: Anyway, the, the funeral’s on Sunday.\\
25 - Sheldon: But, that’s Star Wars Day.\\
26 - Leonard: Yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. You okay? I know he meant a lot to you.\\
27 - Sheldon: I’m fine.\\
28 - Leonard: Okay. Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box.\\
29 - Scene: Amy’s apartment. \\
30 - Professor Proton (on youtube): This, uh, this is something interesting boys and girls. After an owl eats, he spits up part of his meal that he can’t digest, in the form of a pellet. Is, isn’t that a hoot? We’ll be right back after I fire my writers. (Owl hoots) Oh, shut up.\\
31 - Amy: Watching your old friend?\\
32 - Sheldon: Hmm. Yes. Look at him, Amy. It’s such a shame. Struck down in the prime of my life.\\
33 - Amy: Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?\\
34 - Sheldon: Oh, I’m not going to the funeral.\\
35 - Amy: Why not?\\
36 - Sheldon: All those people blowing their noses. You can’t tell the sick from the sad. Mm. I’ll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day, as planned.\\
37 - Amy: Are you sure you don’t want to go say good-bye?\\
38 - Sheldon: Amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time.\\
39 - Amy: And watching a bunch of goofy space movies you’ve seen hundreds of times isn’t?\\
40 - Sheldon: If we were in a physical relationship, you just lost s*x tonight.\\
41 - Scene: The apartment.\\
42 - Penny: Hey, guys.\\
43 - Raj: Hey, Penny. Happy Star Wars Day.\\
44 - Penny: Okay.\\
45 - Raj: Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbar’s Snack Bar is open for business.\\
46 - Penny: No, thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the funeral.\\
47 - Howard: You sure. Not even coffee? We have R2-Decaf. Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?\\
48 - Raj: And if you’re not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.\\
49 - Penny: Oh, I get it, like C3PO. What happened to me?\\
50 - Raj: Hey, uh, Sheldon, you want anything?\\
51 - Sheldon: Uh, no, thank you.\\
52 - Howard: You’re being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?\\
53 - Sheldon: I’m fine.\\
54 - Penny: Sweetie, are you sure you don’t want to come with us to the funeral?\\
55 - Sheldon: Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and there’s nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?\\
56 - Penny: No, he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?\\
57 - Sheldon: Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. I’m sure he didn’t care about silly superstitions like funerals. You know, if he were here, I think he’d say enjoy Star Wars Day.\\
58 - Leonard: He was 84, he’d say where’s my pudding?\\
59 - Raj: Before you go, at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road.\\
60 - Penny: Oh, like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now.\\
61 - Scene: Amy”s apartment. \\
62 - Amy: Arthur passing away was harder on Sheldon than he’s ready to admit. Really hoping this will cheer him up.\\
63 - Bernadette: Me, too. Although, it might’ve been thoughtless of us to bake a Death Star cake.\\
64 - Amy: No, it combines two of Sheldon’s favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button.\\
65 - Bernadette: Well, anyway, it’ll be a nice surprise for the boys. And Howie doesn’t think I take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while.\\
66 - Amy: Okay, let’s get the fondant and start decorating.\\
67 - Bernadette: This is pretty cool. You don’t see too many spherical cakes.\\
68 - Amy: I wonder why that is.\\
69 - Scene: The funeral.\\
70 - Penny: I have a confession to make.\\
71 - Leonard: Hmm?\\
72 - Penny: I’ve never been to a funeral before.\\
73 - Leonard: Really?\\
74 - Penny: I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didn’t have a funeral, we had a barbecue.\\
75 - Leonard: Yeah, we won’t be eating Arthur tonight.\\
76 - Penny: I didn’t know him very well, but I still really liked him. It’s weird that he’s just gone.\\
77 - Leonard: I know.\\
78 - Penny: I feel like I want to cry.\\
79 - Leonard: Oh that’s, that’s fine. Go ahead.\\
80 - Penny: I can’t do it with you staring at me.\\
81 - Leonard: Sorry.\\
82 - Penny: No, I’m dry. You’re a big crybaby, you start, I’ll join in.\\
83 - Leonard: I am not a crybaby.\\
84 - Penny: Toy Story 3?\\
85 - Leonard: The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift.\\
86 - Penny: It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.\\
87 - Leonard: I got your back.\\
88 - Penny: Yeah.\\
89 - Scene: The apartment. \\
90 - Sheldon: Okay, here we go. Episode I: The Phantom Menace.\\
91 - Raj: Ugh, let’s get this over with.\\
92 - Howard: Since we all agree Episode I isn’t our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time.\\
93 - Sheldon: Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it.\\
94 - Raj: You know, I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order, where you watch Episodes IV and V, then skip Episode I, watch II and III as a flashback, and then finish with VI.\\
95 - Howard: Okay, so you’d lose most of Jar Jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters.\\
96 - Sheldon: Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?\\
97 - Raj: It was just a suggestion.\\
98 - Sheldon: Well, you know what else was just a suggestion? Why don’t we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast.\\
99 - Raj: Wow.\\
100 - Howard: I think he’s taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.\\
101 - Raj: Should we try to console him?\\
102 - Howard: Or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?\\
103 - Raj: By staying here and watching the movie.\\
104 - Howard: That’s what good friends would do.\\
105 - Scene: Later.\\
106 - Howard: Well, at least without Sheldon here, we got to start with Episode IV.\\
107 - Raj: Mm, true. I do feel guilty about him.\\
108 - Howard: Me, too.\\
109 - Raj: Maybe we should see how he’s doing.\\
110 - Howard: Yeah.\\
111 - Raj: But after the cantina scene.\\
112 - Howard: Obviously.\\
113 - Scene: Sheldon, dreaming he is in the living room of the apartment on his laptop.\\
114 - Sheldon: Look at Arthur, cracking up at a joke I told him. I’ll never hear that laugh again.\\
115 - Arthur: You never heard it that time.\\
116 - Sheldon: Arthur. I thought you were dead.\\
117 - Arthur: I am. Oh, it, it’s fantastic. I mean this, this is the longest that I’ve gone without running into a men’s room in, in, in years.\\
118 - Sheldon: Why are you here?\\
119 - Arthur: I don’t know. I was, I was hoping I was going to haunt my ex-wife.\\
120 - Sheldon: I know why. You’ve come to me because you’re my Obi-Wan.\\
121 - Arthur: I’m, I’m not, I’m not familiar with that. Is, is, is that an, an Internet?\\
122 - Sheldon: Wow. Uh, you’re dead, so I’m going to let that slide. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars. After his physical demise, he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form.\\
123 - Arthur: Well, that, that clears that up.\\
124 - Sheldon: You must be here to give me advice.\\
125 - Arthur: Well, this, this is weird. Most, most of my robes open in, in the back.\\
126 - Sheldon: Those are your Jedi robes.\\
127 - Arthur: Oh, wait. What, what, what is, what is this?\\
128 - Sheldon: Be careful with that.\\
129 - Arthur: Oh. Oh. Oh, neato. I’m, uh, I’m going to need a Band-Aid.\\
130 - Scene: The funeral.\\
131 - Leonard: So, what did you think of your first funeral?\\
132 - Penny: Well, I don’t want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer.\\
133 - Leonard: Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house.\\
134 - Penny: You think about dying?\\
135 - Leonard: Mm. Well, I think more about if I’d have any regrets.\\
136 - Penny: What would you regret?\\
137 - Leonard: Mm, you know, that I didn’t travel more, take more risks, learn another language.\\
138 - Penny: You know Klingon.\\
139 - Leonard: That’s true.\\
140 - Penny: No, I meant that as a regret.\\
141 - Leonard: I just thought of one more.\\
142 - Penny: What’s that?\\
143 - Leonard: I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.\\
144 - Penny: Well, it just wasn’t the right time.\\
145 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
146 - Penny: And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.\\
147 - Leonard: What?\\
148 - Penny: I know that face. That’s your propose face.\\
149 - Leonard: I was not gonna propose. It’s already two to one.\\
150 - Penny: What’s two to one?\\
151 - Leonard: I proposed twice, you proposed once. Two to one.\\
152 - Penny: Oh, my. It’s not a contest.\\
153 - Leonard: I don’t know what you’re upset about. I’m the one who’s losing.\\
154 - Penny: Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so you could turn me down again?\\
155 - Leonard: Yeah, I think I would.\\
156 - Penny: Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?\\
157 - Leonard: Hmm.\\
158 - Penny: No, don’t you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up.\\
159 - Leonard: It’s just such a big decision. I don’t want to have any regrets.\\
160 - Scene: Amy’s apartment.\\
161 - Amy: Did you ever watch Professor Proton when you were a kid?\\
162 - Bernadette: No. My dad controlled the TV, so unless someone was a Texas Ranger, Jake or the Fatman, we didn’t see it.\\
163 - Amy: I never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that Sheldon got interested in science.\\
164 - Bernadette: Not me. I got into science ’cause I was always the smallest kid in school, so I thought if I became a scientist, I could invent a formula that made me taller.\\
165 - Amy: That’s cute.\\
166 - Bernadette: Yeah, I thought it was working for a while, but then I found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame. How about you?\\
167 - Amy: Oh, I guess it must have been back when I was in the Girl Sprouts.\\
168 - Bernadette: Girl Sprouts?\\
169 - Amy: My mom made it up as an alternative to the Girl Scouts. She didn’t want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore.\\
170 - Bernadette: How did that get you into science?\\
171 - Amy: Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did.\\
172 - Scene: Leonard’s car.\\
173 - Leonard: On the one hand, if I say yes…\\
174 - Penny: This isn’t funny anymore. Just say no so we’re done with this. Will you marry me or not?\\
175 - Leonard: Ooh, interesting. Did you just propose to me again?\\
176 - Penny: No.\\
177 - Leonard: Really? Because I just heard will you marry me? That’s two proposals, one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter.\\
178 - Penny: You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.\\
179 - Leonard: Hey. Penny, don’t get upset. Here. I love you, but, no, I will not marry you.\\
180 - Penny: Thank you.\\
181 - Leonard: Now, about that second proposal. On the one hand…\\
182 - Scene: Sheldon’s dream.\\
183 - Arthur: Where, where, where are we?\\
184 - Sheldon: This is the swampland of Dagobah. It’s where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi.\\
185 - Arthur: Oh. Too bad. I thought it was Florida.\\
186 - Sheldon: When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So, um, what do you got for me?\\
187 - Arthur: Um, always, get, get a prenup.\\
188 - Sheldon: That’s it? I thought there’d be more of a reason why you’re here.\\
189 - Arthur: Well, why, why do you think I’m here?\\
190 - Sheldon: I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.\\
191 - Arthur: Is, is this the, the first time you’ve lost, you know, someone close to you?\\
192 - Sheldon: Oh, no. No. I’ve already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos.\\
193 - Arthur: Yeah, I’ve, I’ve outlived a few of my doctors, too.\\
194 - Sheldon: Of course, my grandfather died when I was five. My father died when I was 14.\\
195 - Arthur: I’m, I’m sorry about that.\\
196 - Sheldon: And now you’re gone, too. It’s like all the men I’ve looked up to have gone away.\\
197 - Arthur: Well, you know, it’s, it’s okay to, to be sad about them. Just, just make sure, you know, you appreciate those who, who are still there for you.\\
198 - Sheldon: But I do appreciate them.\\
199 - Arthur: Well, then, what am I doing in a swamp dressed like Friar Tuck? Appreciate them, Sheldon. (Sheldon is woken up by a knocking on his bedroom door.)\\
200 - Leonard: Hey, buddy. Heard you’re having a rough day. You all right?\\
201 - Sheldon: I’m okay. How was the funeral?\\
202 - Leonard: It was nice, you know. A lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. Did you know that Arthur’s son is a high school sci…? (Sheldon hugs him) Hey, the guys are about to start Jedi. You want to go watch?\\
203 - Sheldon: I do. After I make them go back and watch one through five first.\\
204 - Leonard: Sheldon, that, that’ll take us all night.\\
205 - Sheldon: That’s true. Oh, it’s a good thing I had a nap.\\
206 - Scene: The apartment. \\
207 - Howard: Boy, some of the physical comedy with Jar Jar is a little tough to watch.\\
208 - Leonard: At least they toned him down in the second one.\\
209 - Penny: Yeah, he is pretty stupid.\\
210 - Raj: Hey, we can say it. You can’t.\\
211 - Amy: Hey, guys.\\
212 - Bernadette: Happy Star Wars Day.\\
213 - Sheldon: Wow. A Death Star cake.\\
214 - Amy: Yeah. We were hoping it might cheer you up.\\
215 - Bernadette: And even though it meant we had to miss the movies, we could still be part of the fun.\\
216 - Howard: Well, you didn’t miss anything. We just started over.\\
217 - Bernadette: Son of a bitch.\\
218 - Scene: The same, everyone is falling asleep.\\
219 - Sheldon: You’re back.\\
220 - Arthur: Yeah, apparently, um, I’m here whenever, when, whenever you need me.\\
221 - Sheldon: That’s nice.\\
222 - Arthur: May, maybe for you.\\
223 - Sheldon: Why do I need you now?\\
224 - Arthur: Well, as near as I could tell, you, you fell asleep watching Star Wars, and now you’re, you’re dreaming you’re watching Star Wars.\\
225 - Sheldon: So?\\
226 - Arthur: I mean, don’t, don’t you see a problem there? I mean, how, how you’re spending your limited time on Earth?\\
227 - Sheldon: Not at all.\\
228 - Arthur: Okay, good luck to you.
\subsection {Episode 23: The Gorilla Dissolution}
1 - Scene: The upstairs landing of Mrs Wolowitz’s house.\\
2 - Bernadette: Almost there. You’re doing great.\\
3 - Howard: Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box.\\
4 - Raj: Please hurry.\\
5 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): I don’t need a treadmill.\\
6 - Howard: The doctor says you need to get exercise.\\
7 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): I get plenty of exercise.\\
8 - Howard: Crushing my will to live isn’t exercise.\\
9 - Raj: If she isn’t gonna use it, then why are we doing this?\\
10 - Howard: She’ll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.\\
11 - Raj: All right. Now what?\\
12 - Bernadette: We set it up in Howie’s old room.\\
13 - Raj: Do you know how to set it up?\\
14 - Howard: Please, I’m an MIT-trained engineer. I think I can handle… Ma, look out.\\
15 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Aaaaah! I told you this thing would kill me.\\
16 - Credits sequence.\\
17 - Scene: The apartment.\\
18 - Raj: So she’s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.\\
19 - Leonard: Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.\\
20 - Amy: Should we do something for her?\\
21 - Sheldon: I know. Let’s go see the new Spider-Man movie.\\
22 - Amy: Sheldon, we’re talking about your friend’s mother. She got hurt.\\
23 - Sheldon: I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It’s called reading the room, Amy.\\
24 - Penny: Hi.\\
25 - Leonard: Hey, how were things on the set?\\
26 - Penny: Uh, pretty good, actually.\\
27 - Raj: So the movie’s not as bad as you thought?\\
28 - Penny: Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining about it, I’m just gonna go in every day and give it my all.\\
29 - Amy: Good for you.\\
30 - Penny: Thanks. There’s no reason why I shouldn’t be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone’s ever seen.\\
31 - Leonard: I don’t know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler’s List is tough to beat.\\
32 - Sheldon: Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.\\
33 - Leonard: It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.\\
34 - Sheldon: I know.\\
35 - Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.\\
36 - Howard: Okay, she’s all settled in the guest room.\\
37 - Bernadette: Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.\\
38 - Howard: You mean a forklift?\\
39 - Bernadette: Howie.\\
40 - Howard: I’m sorry. I just can’t deal with this right now.\\
41 - Bernadette: Taking care of your own mother? How can you say that?\\
42 - Howard: Bernie, she’s gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. Are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?\\
43 - Bernadette: I would do it for my mother.\\
44 - Howard: Yeah, of course you would, you’re a loving person. I’m what my people would call a putz.\\
45 - Bernadette: Look, I’m not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?\\
46 - Howard: We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world country who’s used to suffering and unpleasant smells.\\
47 - Bernadette: You’d hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? That’s so cruel.\\
48 - Howard: Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.\\
49 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): I need to tinkle.\\
50 - Howard: Sounds like a job for a loving person. Would you like me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?\\
51 - Bernadette: You are a putz.\\
52 - Howard: As advertised.\\
53 - Scene: A cinema.\\
54 - Sheldon: Thanks for coming with me.\\
55 - Raj: Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren’t you gonna get 3-D glasses?\\
56 - Sheldon: I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.\\
57 - Raj: Is that a real thing?\\
58 - Sheldon: Well, until they invent nose condoms, I’m not finding out.\\
59 - Raj: Emily, Hey.\\
60 - Emily: Oh, hey, Raj.\\
61 - Raj: Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily.\\
62 - Sheldon: Oh, yes, you’re the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?\\
63 - Emily: Um, you know what? I better go. My movie’s about to start.\\
64 - Raj: Are you here alone?\\
65 - Emily: No, not really.\\
66 - Raj: What do you mean, not really?\\
67 - Man: Hey, should we get our seats?\\
68 - Emily: Yeah. It was nice seeing you. Um, I’ll call you later.\\
69 - Raj: Yeah, okay.\\
70 - Sheldon: That was awkward, right?\\
71 - Raj: Uh-huh.\\
72 - Sheldon: Is it because she’s dating you but was out with that other fellow?\\
73 - Raj: Yes.\\
74 - Sheldon: Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.\\
75 - Scene: The movie set. \\
76 - Director: And action.\\
77 - Wil Wheaton: Please don’t shut me out.\\
78 - Penny: Go away. Just go away.\\
79 - Wil: I swear, I will find a way to turn you back.\\
80 - Penny: What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?\\
81 - Wil: I was trying to save your life.\\
82 - Penny: Life? What life? Look at me, I’m a monster. And now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I don’t know.\\
83 - Wil: You can’t give up. I love you.\\
84 - Penny: I love you, too. But I’m afraid I love killing more. Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you.\\
85 - Director: And cut. All right. All right, let’s set up for the next scene.\\
86 - Penny: Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better.\\
87 - Director: Let’s just move on. No one cares.\\
88 - Penny: Well, I care. I mean, look, if we’re gonna do this, why not try and make it something we’re actually proud of?\\
89 - Director: Look, sweetie, this movie is garbage, but you should be happy about that, ’cause if it was a good movie, you wouldn’t be in it.\\
90 - Leonard: Whoa, whoa, hang on. There’s no need to insult her.\\
91 - Director: And who are you?\\
92 - Leonard: I’m her boyfriend.\\
93 - Director: Isn’t she too hot for you?\\
94 - Leonard: A little, yeah.\\
95 - Director: Well, boyfriend, get off my set.\\
96 - Penny: You can’t do that. He’s with me.\\
97 - Director: You know what? You can get off my set, too. You’re fired.\\
98 - Penny: What? You can’t fire me. I’m the star. I’m the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.\\
99 - Director: Yeah, but we just shot the last scene where we see your face. So from now own, the star of the movie is whoever wears this.\\
100 - Wil: Hey, if you’re gonna fire her, then you have to fire me, too.\\
101 - Scene: A bar.\\
102 - Wil: Wow, that fell apart really fast.\\
103 - Scene: The apartment.\\
104 - Raj: Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn’t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.\\
105 - Sheldon: Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare I’ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don’t have all the ingredients to make chai tea.\\
106 - Raj: You don’t have to make me anything.\\
107 - Sheldon: No, I do. You’re upset about Emily and you’re Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?\\
108 - Raj: Sorry, I left them in my turban.\\
109 - Sheldon: Oh, I’ll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That’s close enough. You know, I’m curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?\\
110 - Raj: Wouldn’t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?\\
111 - Sheldon: Can’t happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.\\
112 - Raj: But you don’t have s*x with her, either.\\
113 - Sheldon: Slick, huh?\\
114 - Raj: To be truthful, Emily and I haven’t dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.\\
115 - Sheldon: Have you had intercourse?\\
116 - Raj: No.\\
117 - Sheldon: Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure.\\
118 - Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.\\
119 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): I’m hungry again.\\
120 - Howard: It’s like the world’s fattest cuckoo clock.\\
121 - Bernadette: You know, you’re always talking about having a baby someday. This is exactly what it’s gonna be like.\\
122 - Howard: No, it’s not.\\
123 - Bernadette: Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. We’re even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own.\\
124 - Howard: Maybe you’re right. Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.\\
125 - Bernadette: I’m just telling you now, if we do have kids, don’t expect me to do all the work.\\
126 - Howard: Hey, I’m a very paternal person. I’d be excellent at taking care of a baby.\\
127 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): I’m still hungry.\\
128 - Howard: I’m coming, you big baby.\\
129 - Scene: The bar.\\
130 - Penny: You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass.\\
131 - Wil: Forget it, man, it’s crap. You just move on to the next thing.\\
132 - Penny: Yeah, well, it’s easy for you to say. You used to be famous.\\
133 - Wil: Hey. I just lost a job for you.\\
134 - Penny: All right, I’m sorry, you’re famous.\\
135 - Wil: Penny, it’s not about being famous. It’s about the art. It’s about the passion we have for our craft. (Text message tone) I have an audition for Sharknado 2. If I book this, I am totally gonna pay you back for this beer.\\
136 - Penny: God, what am I doing with my life?\\
137 - Leonard: You having second thoughts about acting?\\
138 - Penny: You were on set, you saw what it was like.\\
139 - Leonard: Yeah, but it’s not always that bad.\\
140 - Penny: Oh, really?\\
141 - Leonard: What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute little theater?\\
142 - Penny: It was over a bowling alley.\\
143 - Leonard: Yeah, but there was ample parking.\\
144 - Penny: Are you done?\\
145 - Leonard: And you were so good in the TV commercial.\\
146 - Penny: It was for haemorrhoid cream.\\
147 - Leonard: And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.\\
148 - Penny: Leonard, you are really not cheering me up.\\
149 - Leonard: Come on. How can you be sad when you’re going home with all five-foot-six of this?\\
150 - Penny: Hmm. You think you’re five-foot-six, that’s funny.\\
151 - Scene: The apartment.\\
152 - Raj: I don’t understand it. I’m a nice guy, I have a great job, I’m well-educated, come from a good family. Why don’t women want to be with me?\\
153 - Sheldon: An interesting question. Well, good night.\\
154 - Raj: What? Don’t send me home. I can’t be alone right now.\\
155 - Sheldon: That’s your problem. You can’t be alone.\\
156 - Raj: What do you mean?\\
157 - Sheldon: How many women have you had dates with?\\
158 - Raj: Eleven.\\
159 - Sheldon: How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?\\
160 - Raj: Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?\\
161 - Sheldon: Sure.\\
162 - Raj: I’ll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.\\
163 - Sheldon: Well, now do you see the problem?\\
164 - Raj: Maybe. I, I don’t know.It’s late, I should, I should go. Look, I do get what you’re saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone.\\
165 - Sheldon: I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it’s my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night.\\
166 - Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.\\
167 - Bernadette: Howie, I’m back!\\
168 - Howard: Shh, I just got her to sleep.\\
169 - Bernadette: Sorry.\\
170 - Howard: What took you so long? The grocery store is a few blocks away.\\
171 - Bernadette: They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.\\
172 - Howard: Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?\\
173 - Bernadette: So what? After two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha.\\
174 - Howard: A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen.\\
175 - Bernadette: Queen? I’ve been killing myself here.\\
176 - Howard: Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, I’m nice, I want to take care of people.\\
177 - Bernadette: I’m glad I got that mocha. And you know what else I’m glad about? I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car.\\
178 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard.\\
179 - Howard: Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.\\
180 - Scene: Raj’s apartment.\\
181 - Raj: Hey.\\
182 - Emily: Thanks for letting me come over.\\
183 - Raj: Of course. Please, come in.\\
184 - Emily: I just wanted to say how sorry I am about tonight, and I want to make sure that we’re okay.\\
185 - Raj: Uh, look, you and I haven’t made any commitments to each other.\\
186 - Emily: I know. I just felt like I needed to explain. The guy I was with did my last tattoo, and he’s been asking me out for months. I finally said yes just to get it over with.\\
187 - Raj: It’s okay.\\
188 - Emily: Really?\\
189 - Raj: Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that’s my issue, not yours.\\
190 - Emily: Wow. If I saw you out with another woman, I’d be pretty upset.\\
191 - Raj: Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen.\\
192 - Emily: Just so you know, I’m not seeing anyone else.\\
193 - Raj: Well, me, neither.\\
194 - Emily: Okay.\\
195 - Raj: Okay. Please. So, uh, you, you have tattoos?\\
196 - Emily: Yeah.\\
197 - Raj: I don’t. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.\\
198 - Emily: That’s cool.\\
199 - Raj: It’s a piercing. So, uh, how many tattoos?\\
200 - Emily: One on my shoulder, one not on my shoulder and one really not on my shoulder.\\
201 - Raj: It’s, uh, been a long time since I’ve seen a girl’s really not her shoulder.\\
202 - Emily: Well, how about you show me your piercing and I show you my tattoos?\\
203 - Raj: But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches.\\
204 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
205 - Penny: Oh, my God. What a day.\\
206 - Leonard: Can I get you anything?\\
207 - Penny: No. I need to start making some smart decisions.\\
208 - Leonard: With your career?\\
209 - Penny: With my life.\\
210 - Leonard: Like what?\\
211 - Penny: I don’t know. We could get married.\\
212 - Leonard: Come on, be serious.\\
213 - Penny: I am.\\
214 - Leonard: Why? Because I’m a, a smart decision?\\
215 - Penny: Well, yeah.\\
216 - Leonard: So I’m like a bran muffin.\\
217 - Penny: What? No, that’s not what I’m saying.\\
218 - Leonard: No, it’s exactly what you’re saying. I’m the boring thing you’re choosing because I’m good for you.\\
219 - Penny: What does it matter? The point is, I’m choosing you.\\
220 - Leonard: Well, it matters a lot. I don’t want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you’re excited about even though it could give you diabetes.\\
221 - Penny: Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.\\
222 - Leonard: No, no. No, it’s too late. I’m your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon.\\
223 - Penny: You know what? Forget it. I never should’ve brought it up.\\
224 - Leonard: You know I want to marry you, but you’re only doing this because you got fired and you’re feeling sorry for yourself.\\
225 - Penny: Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? I finally realize I don’t need to be famous or have some big career to be happy.\\
226 - Leonard: Then what do you need?\\
227 - Penny: You, you stupid Pop-Tart.\\
228 - Leonard: Oh. Then I guess I’m in.\\
229 - Penny: Really? You guess you’re in?\\
230 - Leonard: Not like, I guess I’m in. Like I guess, I’m in!\\
231 - Penny: Okay. Leonard: Cool.\\
232 - Leonard: So is that it? Are, are we engaged?\\
233 - Penny: Yeah, I think so.\\
234 - Leonard: All right.\\
235 - Penny: What’s wrong?\\
236 - Leonard: I’m not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.\\
237 - Penny: Yeah, it kind of does, huh?\\
238 - Leonard: Oh, I know. This might help.\\
239 - Penny: Where did you get a ring?\\
240 - Leonard: I’ve had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?\\
241 - Penny: Oh, my God, yes.\\
242 - Leonard: This would have been so much more romantic if you didn’t have monkey hair on your finger.\\
243 - Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.\\
244 - Howard: How you feeling?\\
245 - Bernadette: Last night was a little rough, but I think we’re gonna get through this.\\
246 - Howard: I’m proud of us.\\
247 - Bernadette: Me, too.\\
248 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Where’s my pancakes?!\\
249 - Foreign Nurse: Coming, Mrs. Wolowitz!\\
250 - Bernadette: You were right.\\
251 - Howard: Welcome to Team Putz.
\subsection {Episode 24: The Status Quo Combustion}
1 - Scene: The Apartment.\\
2 - Leonard: How’s your mom holding up?\\
3 - Howard: She’s doing okay, but we just lost another nurse.\\
4 - Amy: How many is that now?\\
5 - Howard: Two, and I know what you’re thinking, she’s eating them.\\
6 - Bernadette: She’s just so impossible, they keep quitting.\\
7 - Sheldon: So, who’s watching her now?\\
8 - Howard: A bowl full of M&M’s with a few Ambien tossed in.\\
9 - Raj: What up, guys?\\
10 - All: Hello, hey!\\
11 - Leonard: Okay. Well, now that everyone’s here, Penny and I have some big news. We’re engaged.\\
12 - General cheering and congratulations.\\
13 - Raj: And I thought me having s*x with Emily was gonna be the big news.\\
14 - General cheering and congratulations.\\
15 - Leonard: Hey, hey, what the hell?\\
16 - Bernadette: You guys propose all the time. This never happens.\\
17 - Penny: You’re right! Yay!\\
18 - Credits sequence.\\
19 - Scene: The cafeteria.\\
20 - Raj: Boy, I’m so hungry today. I wonder why?\\
21 - Howard: Because you had s*x the other night?\\
22 - Raj: You know what? That may be it. By the way, it isn’t like riding a bike. Like, I fell off a few times.\\
23 - Leonard: Hey, buddy.\\
24 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
25 - Leonard: You okay?\\
26 - Sheldon: I just got called into President Siebert’s office. The university won’t let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. They’re forcing me to continue with string theory.\\
27 - Howard: Why?\\
28 - Sheldon: He said it’s why they hired me, it’s, it’s what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they don’t want to do. He then gave an example of something he had to do, even though he didn’t want to, which was look at my stupid face.\\
29 - Leonard: That’s a rude thing to say, out loud.\\
30 - Sheldon: It’s an outrage. Honestly, I’m tempted to leave the university.\\
31 - Howard: You know, if you’re really serious about that, I hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat.\\
32 - Leonard: Whatever you do, just don’t make any rash decisions.\\
33 - Sheldon: I don’t know. I am really aggravated.\\
34 - Raj: When I’m feeling low, I have s*x with a girl. But that’s just me.\\
35 - Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.\\
36 - Howard: Oh, come on, give her a chance.\\
37 - Nurse: No. Life, it is too short.\\
38 - Bernadette: I know you’ve only been here a day and a half, but you’re like part of the family. I don’t think the service is gonna send any more people.\\
39 - Howard: Yeah, maybe it’s time we just release Ma back into the sea.\\
40 - Bernadette: That’s not helpful.\\
41 - Howard: Well, then, we may need to get used to the idea that we’re gonna be living here the next few months.\\
42 - Bernadette: But we have jobs. We can’t baby-sit her 24 hours a day.\\
43 - Howard: Well, what if we use our vacation time?\\
44 - Bernadette: I wanted to go to Hawaii, not hell.\\
45 - Howard: I don’t know what else we can do.\\
46 - Bernadette: Howie, I love you, and as your wife, your mother is every bit as much my problem as she is yours, so, I want a divorce.\\
47 - Scene: The apartment.\\
48 - Mrs Hofstadter (on webcam): Hello, Leonard.\\
49 - Leonard: Hi, Mom. I have some exciting news.\\
50 - Mrs Hofstadter: I’m listening.\\
51 - Leonard: Before I tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?\\
52 - Mrs Hofstadter: No. Let me save you all of your hemming and hawing. Sheldon already told me that you and Penny are engaged.\\
53 - Leonard: I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.\\
54 - Mrs Hofstadter: Would you like for you and me to talk more?\\
55 - Leonard: You know what? It’s probably fine.\\
56 - Mrs Hofstadter: In any event, while I’ve had my misgivings about Penny, Sheldon spoke very fondly of her, and if she is good enough for him, then she’s good enough for me.\\
57 - Leonard: I’m your son. What about the fact that she’s good enough for me?\\
58 - Mrs Hofstadter: Sure.\\
59 - Leonard: Thanks, Mom.\\
60 - Mrs Hofstadter: Leonard, would it make you feel better to hear that your mother approved of your life choices?\\
61 - Leonard: Yes, it would.\\
62 - Mrs Hofstadter: Yeah. Well, you should work on that.\\
63 - Scene: Penny’s apartment.\\
64 - Penny (on phone): No, Mom, it’s the same guy I’ve been going out with for the past two years. Yeah, the scientist. Well, it’s complicated. I mean, he works with lasers and atomic magnets. No, I did not see it coming. No, we did not set a date. No, I am not pregnant. Yeah, this is a first for our family. All right, tell Dad I love him. I gotta go. All right, bye.\\
65 - Amy: Atomic magnets?\\
66 - Penny: Shut up.\\
67 - Bernadette: Sorry I’m late. The leaf blower broke, so I had to hand-dry my mother-in-law.\\
68 - Penny: You want some wine?\\
69 - Bernadette: Thanks. Little warning before you jump into this marriage business. You’re not just marrying him, you’re marrying his family.\\
70 - Penny: I think Leonard’s mom’s okay with me.\\
71 - Bernadette: It doesn’t matter if she’s okay with you. The question is, can she go to the bathroom by herself? Hit me again.\\
72 - Amy: So, what are the living arrangements gonna be?\\
73 - Penny: Well, haven’t really talked about it yet, but I figure at some point, I’ll move in with him, or he’ll move in with me.\\
74 - Amy: Well, with you not working, that makes financial sense.\\
75 - Bernadette: You’re not working. How would you like a job in home health care?\\
76 - Penny: Not a chance.\\
77 - Bernadette: Please. I’m desperate.\\
78 - Penny: No.\\
79 - Bernadette: I’ll pay you anything you want.\\
80 - Penny: Okay, then, yeah.\\
81 - Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.\\
82 - Penny: No, keep your money.\\
83 - Bernadette: I could’ve ridden a bull longer than that.\\
84 - Scene: The apartment.\\
85 - Leonard: What you working on?\\
86 - Sheldon: I’m writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate, so that I can move on from string theory.\\
87 - Leonard: Oh. How’s it going?\\
88 - Sheldon: You tell me. Dear Esteemed Colleagues, as you may know, I have requested to change my field of study. My decision to do so is, I believe, in the best interest of science. At your convenience, I’d be happy to explain it to you in words you’ll understand.\\
89 - Leonard: It’s nice that you called them esteemed.\\
90 - Sheldon: You’re right. I’ll take that out.\\
91 - Leonard: So, listen, there was something I was hoping to float past you.\\
92 - Sheldon: Mm.\\
93 - Leonard: Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements.\\
94 - Sheldon: Of course. She’s spent many nights here, and you’re worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding.\\
95 - Leonard: I’m not.\\
96 - Sheldon: Good, because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit an iceberg, countless men would perish.\\
97 - Leonard: Actually, this is about where she and I are going to live.\\
98 - Sheldon: What do you mean?\\
99 - Leonard: Well, well, we might want to live together.\\
100 - Sheldon: Oh, yeah, well, I’ve already given this some thought, and I’m willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. Now, obviously, not when she’s made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining.\\
101 - Leonard: That’s very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with… not you.\\
102 - Sheldon: I don’t understand. How could we all live together if I’m not there?\\
103 - Leonard: Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary.\\
104 - Sheldon: Where are you going to go?\\
105 - Leonard: I don’t know. We just started to think about this. Maybe I’ll move in with Penny, or maybe she and I’ll take this place, and you can move across the hall.\\
106 - Sheldon: Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?\\
107 - Leonard: No, I did not.\\
108 - Sheldon: Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?\\
109 - Leonard: No.\\
110 - Sheldon: Well, then, I’m all out of guesses. What? Me move across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?\\
111 - Leonard: Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life she deserves.\\
112 - Sheldon: I see. You’re putting your future bride’s happiness above mine.\\
113 - Leonard: Well, yeah.\\
114 - Sheldon: Wow.\\
115 - Scene: Amy’s apartment.\\
116 - Sheldon: How dare the university force me to go back to string theory?\\
117 - Amy: They just don’t appreciate you.\\
118 - Sheldon: Yeah, and on top of that, Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged, he may not want to live with me any more.\\
119 - Amy: Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik.\\
120 - Sheldon: I have real problems here, Amy. I can’t be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy.\\
121 - Amy: You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, you’re always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when you’re not there.\\
122 - Sheldon: Ugh, it’s like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and snakes.\\
123 - Amy: You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.\\
124 - Sheldon: Four keys! Who does he think he is, a warden?\\
125 - Amy: See? Maybe you’ll love living alone.\\
126 - Sheldon: I don’t know. Perhaps.\\
127 - Amy: And if it turns out you don’t, you and I could live together.\\
128 - Sheldon: You and… oh, sure, and while we’re at it, why don’t we get engaged, too? Why don’t we get a little house, start a family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself, woman?\\
129 - Amy: Sheldon, it was just a thought.\\
130 - Sheldon: No. Here’s a thought. You’re not moving in, Leonard’s not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. And by the way, I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup, you’re supposed to use the powder.\\
131 - Amy: It tastes the same.\\
132 - Sheldon: No. The syrup tastes better and I don’t like it.\\
133 - Scene: The apartment.\\
134 - Penny: This is so sweet. You never cook for me.\\
135 - Leonard: Well, you cook for me all the time and, ugh.\\
136 - Penny: If you don’t like my cooking, why haven’t you ever said anything?\\
137 - Leonard: It’s hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.\\
138 - Penny: Sorry. I’ll get better.\\
139 - Leonard: I know you’ll try. So, should we talk about setting a date?\\
140 - Penny: Well, I’d like to pick one that works with my brother’s schedule.\\
141 - Leonard: Okay. And when would that be?\\
142 - Penny: Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behaviour.\\
143 - Amy: Hi, is Sheldon here?\\
144 - Leonard: No, I thought he was with you.\\
145 - Amy: He was, but he stormed off and now he isn’t answering his phone.\\
146 - Leonard: What happened?\\
147 - Amy: He was really angry that you suggested he move out.\\
148 - Leonard: Oh.\\
149 - Amy: I also mentioned that he and I could live together but he was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is.\\
150 - Leonard: Well, he’s been having a couple of tough days. I’m sure he’s fine. He probably just needs a little alone time to decompress.\\
151 - Amy: You’re probably right. So, what are you guys doing?\\
152 - Penny: Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we’re just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple.\\
153 - Amy: That’s nice.\\
154 - Leonard: Anyway, as I was saying, Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. ‘Cause that’s important. Not just for him, but for most anybody, really.\\
155 - Amy: Don’t I know it. What is that, polenta?\\
156 - Penny: Amy, get out.\\
157 - Amy: Right.\\
158 - Scene: The comic book store.\\
159 - Sheldon: No.\\
160 - Stuart: Hey, Sheldon.\\
161 - Sheldon: What happened?\\
162 - Stuart: I was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire.\\
163 - Sheldon: And you couldn’t put it out?\\
164 - Stuart: I was across the street at the do-it-yourself car wash, taking a shower.\\
165 - Sheldon: So when will you reopen?\\
166 - Stuart: Um, I don’t know. I’m waiting to hear back from the insurance company.\\
167 - Sheldon: So, tomorrow?\\
168 - Stuart: I don’t mean to be rude, Sheldon, but, uh, my life is kind of falling apart right now.\\
169 - Sheldon: Your life? The university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me. And now, the place I need to go when I’m sad is damp and smells funny.\\
170 - Stuart: Well, sorry I let you down.\\
171 - Sheldon: No. I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. It stops now. I’m helping you get back on your feet. I would like to purchase this comic book, please.\\
172 - Stuart: That’ll be $2.99.\\
173 - Sheldon: Really? It’s soaking wet.\\
174 - Stuart: Fine, a dollar.\\
175 - Sheldon: Can you break a twenty?\\
176 - Stuart: No, I only have hundreds.\\
177 - Sheldon: You know what? I don’t always recognize sarcasm, but I do right now, and I don’t appreciate it. I’m sorry for your loss. But you’re not the only one whose day has been a disaster.\\
178 - Stuart: (Light falls on ground just where he was standing a moment before) That could have killed me. I can’t catch a break.\\
179 - Scene: The apartment.\\
180 - Leonard: I haven’t heard from Sheldon in a while. You think he’s okay?\\
181 - Penny: Oh, I’m sure he’s fine.\\
182 - Leonard: I’m gonna see where he is.\\
183 - Penny: How?\\
184 - Leonard: Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone.\\
185 - Penny: You do that?\\
186 - Leonard: Not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, I get worried.\\
187 - Penny: He can take care of himself. Look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle.\\
188 - Leonard: That’s weird.\\
189 - Penny: What?\\
190 - Leonard: He’s at the train station.\\
191 - Penny: So? He loves trains.\\
192 - Leonard: It’s dark out and he’s alone, I don’t like it. Let’s go get him.\\
193 - Penny: It’s sweet how you look out for him. You’re a good guy.\\
194 - Leonard: It’s not just that. My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him.\\
195 - Scene: The comic book store.\\
196 - Raj: Dude, I’m so sorry.\\
197 - Howard: Don’t take this the wrong way, but did you do this for the insurance money?\\
198 - Stuart: No. God, you sound like the police, the firemen, my parents, my therapist and the insurance company.\\
199 - Raj: We’re here for you, man. Whatever you need, okay?\\
200 - Stuart: Uh, actually, I was wondering if I could crash at your place for a few nights.\\
201 - Raj: Sure, of course. Oh, actually, Emily was gonna spend the night.\\
202 - Stuart: You slept with her? Nice.\\
203 - Raj: Well, I can’t take all the credit. She let me do it to her, but, uh, but I can always call her and cancel.\\
204 - Howard: Hang on. I know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time.\\
205 - Stuart: Great.\\
206 - Howard: I just have to warn you, it’ll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse.\\
207 - Stuart: So what’s the catch?\\
208 - Scene: The train station.\\
209 - Leonard: Sheldon.\\
210 - Sheldon: You tracked my phone?\\
211 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
212 - Sheldon: Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles.\\
213 - Penny: We were worried about you.\\
214 - Sheldon: Don’t be melodramatic. I’m just getting on a train and leaving forever.\\
215 - Leonard: Seriously? You don’t even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.\\
216 - Sheldon: My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It’s called living off the land.\\
217 - Leonard: Okay, I know you’re upset and there’s a lot of stuff going on, but it’s nothing we can’t work out. Come on, let’s get you home.\\
218 - Sheldon: No. I’ve reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now.\\
219 - Penny: And go where?\\
220 - Sheldon: It doesn’t matter.\\
221 - Leonard: So a few things don’t go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?\\
222 - Sheldon: I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And I’d sooner die than eat beans out of a can.\\
223 - Leonard: Come on, come home with us and tomorrow I’ll, I’ll take you to Legoland.\\
224 - Sheldon: Legoland is not the solution to everything. And it’s too much of a scene since that movie came out.\\
225 - Leonard: Then what can I do?\\
226 - Sheldon: Leonard, I am overwhelmed. Everything is changing and it’s simply too much. I need to get away and think.\\
227 - Leonard: Oh, come on, you know you’re overreacting.\\
228 - Penny: Leonard, hang on. Just come here. Maybe we need to let him go.\\
229 - Leonard: What? Why?\\
230 - Penny: It might be good for him.\\
231 - Leonard: You know he can’t take a trip like this by himself.\\
232 - Penny: He’s a grown man.\\
233 - Leonard: No, he looks like a grown man. You’ve seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.\\
234 - Penny: Leonard, we can’t protect him forever.\\
235 - Leonard: I know, but…\\
236 - Penny: He’ll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan.\\
237 - Sheldon: Good Lord. Padawan’s the student, not the teacher.\\
238 - Penny: Seriously, let him go.\\
239 - Leonard: Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I’m not gonna stand in your way.\\
240 - Sheldon: I do.\\
241 - Leonard: Okay. Good luck.\\
242 - Penny: Be safe and call us.\\
243 - Sheldon: I will.\\
244 - Leonard: Bye, buddy. Sheldon?\\
245 - Sheldon: Yes?\\
246 - Leonard: I’m gonna miss you.\\
247 - Sheldon: Of course you are.\\
248 - Leonard: He just made that easier.\\
249 - Penny: Mm.\\
250 - Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.\\
251 - Stuart: Hey. What are you guys still doing here? I got this, go. Go home.\\
252 - Howard: You sure?\\
253 - Stuart: Yeah, she’s fed, she took her pills, she’s all tucked in and watching TV.\\
254 - Bernadette: So, she’s not too much for you?\\
255 - Stuart: Are you kidding? I love her, she’s great.\\
256 - Mrs Wolowitz (off): Stewie, you gonna watch Wheel of Fortune with me?\\
257 - Stuart: Coming, Debbie.\\
258 - Howard: You call her Debbie?\\
259 - Stuart: She insisted. So, hey, guys, thank you so much. This job is a dream come true.\\
260 - Howard: Was that a little weird?\\
261 - Bernadette: Yeah. I don’t know why, but something about it feels unnatural.\\
262 - Howard: Okay, let’s go.\\
263 - Bernadette: Yep.\\
264 - Scene: The apartment.\\
265 - Amy (on phone): Okay, Sheldon, thanks for checking in. Talk to you tomorrow? Oh, okay, bye.\\
266 - Leonard: He’s okay?\\
267 - Amy: Actually sounds like he’s doing pretty well.\\
268 - Penny: I really think this is gonna be for the best.\\
269 - Leonard: Me, too. And he was able to take a sabbatical from…\\
270 - Amy: How could you let him go?

\subsection {Episode 02: The Junior Professor Solution}
1 - [ The apartment ]\\
2 - Sheldon: I recently read that during World War Two, Joseph Stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas.\\
3 - Howard: What a sick use of science.\\
4 - Raj: Hey, as long as the baby's healthy.\\
5 - Amy: I wonder if Stalin considered any other animals.\\
6 - Leonard: Hippos are the deadliest creature. A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass.\\
7 - Howard: Yes, but when they're hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles.\\
8 - Sheldon: Yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn't be attacked.\\
9 - Raj: But half-man, half-owl could fly…\\
10 - Sheldon: The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. Moving on.\\
11 - Howard: So, Penny, when's the new job start?\\
12 - Penny: Next Monday.\\
13 - Bernadette: Did you get a chance to look over the materials I gave you?\\
14 - Penny: Uh, not yet, but I will.\\
15 - Bernadette: Great. When?\\
16 - Penny: I said I'll get to it.\\
17 - Sheldon: I'm sensing awkwardness, am I right?\\
18 - Amy: Yes.\\
19 - Sheldon: Swish.\\
20 - Bernadette: I don't want to be pushy, but you've never done pharmaceutical sales before. It seems like you could use this time to get a head start.\\
21 - Penny: Well, the first few weeks will be all training. They'll tell me everything I need to know.\\
22 - Bernadette: But imagine how impressed they'd be if you showed up already familiar with the material.\\
23 - Penny: Okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacher's pet?\\
24 - Bernadette: Couldn't hurt.\\
25 - Leonard: Mm, I don't know. Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher's pet?\\
26 - Sheldon: It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz.\\
27 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\

1 - [ The apartment ]\\
2 - Howard: So, how does this game work? I just throw it, like a real ball?\\
3 - Leonard: Yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate.\\
4 - Howard: All right.\\
5 - Raj: You suck, Wolowitz.\\
6 - Howard: What's that about?\\
7 - Raj: I'm heckling you. It's a beloved part of baseball.\\
8 - Sheldon: He's right. And given that you're probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, I'm sure you do suck.\\
9 - Penny: Hi. What's going on?\\
10 - Leonard: Baseball.\\
11 - Penny: Okay, this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play.\\
12 - Leonard: He's practicing.\\
13 - Penny: For what?\\
14 - Howard: The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch, so guess who they called?\\
15 - Penny: What, you? Really?\\
16 - Howard: Well, a lot of people who weren't available, but then me.\\
17 - Penny: That's so cool. Congratulations. I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.\\
18 - Sheldon: Well, not just him. May I remind you that you're talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.\\
19 - Penny: I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn't something you forget.\\
20 - Leonard: C'mon now, throw one.\\
21 - Howard: All right, here we go.\\
22 - Raj: You look like a jackass.\\
23 - Howard: Cut it out. You're hurting my feelings.\\

1 - [ The cafeteria ]\\
2 - Leonard: Have you guys heard about this research team that's trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?\\
3 - Sheldon: Oh, I think that sounds wonderful.\\
4 - Howard: What? You're afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.\\
5 - Sheldon: Yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn't hit the Mesozoic spot.\\
6 - Raj: Hey, guys.\\
7 - Howard: Hey.\\
8 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
9 - Raj: We still on for tomorrow night?\\
10 - Leonard: Yeah. I'm excited to finally meet your girlfriend.\\
11 - Sheldon: Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends.\\
12 - Howard: Since when do you read social science?\\
13 - Sheldon: I go to the bathroom like everybody else.\\
14 - Raj: Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?\\
15 - Leonard: Yeah, you didn't lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I would categorize the two of us.\\
16 - Raj: You guys kiss and hold hands.\\
17 - Leonard: I've seen him do it. It's not romantic.\\
18 - Raj: Look, I'm not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he's in a relationship.\\
19 - Leonard: What happens if she doesn't like us?\\
20 - Raj: Well, hey, you're my dear friends. You'll get a Christmas card for a couple of years, and then you're dead to me.\\

1 - [ The cafeteria ]\\
2 - Raj: Hey, I read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking.\\
3 - Leonard: We had that idea years ago. How come we never did anything with it?\\
4 - Howard: Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back.\\
5 - Sheldon: I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town.\\
6 - Leonard: That's not what happened.\\
7 - Sheldon: I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss's death.\\
8 - Howard: No one wants to hear it.\\
9 - Sheldon: Why, die. Why did he die? Old, told. I was told he was old.\\
10 - Leonard: Penny is not the reason I didn't pursue that idea.\\
11 - Sheldon: Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?\\
12 - Raj: Easy. Sleeping with Penny.\\
13 - Howard: Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.\\
14 - Raj: Tricking Penny into getting engaged.\\
15 - Howard: And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up.\\
16 - Leonard: I think someone owes me an apology.\\
17 - Sheldon: Well, don't feel bad. I think we've all been distracted since the girls entered our lives.\\
18 - Howard: You admit Amy's a distraction?\\
19 - Sheldon: Oh, very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. Hi. Hope you're having a good day. Who has time for this constant sexting?\\
20 - Leonard: Well, maybe we have lost our focus.\\
21 - Howard: It wouldn't kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.\\
22 - Raj: Ooh, we could have one of those retreats.\\
23 - Leonard: Like our own science retreat.\\
24 - Howard: My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.\\
25 - Sheldon: I'm not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?\\
26 - Leonard: Then we'll go to a hotel.\\
27 - Sheldon: A hotel? Did you see The Shining?\\
28 - Raj: We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.\\
29 - Sheldon: Did you see The Lake House?\\
30 - Raj: Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.\\
31 - Sheldon: Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me. Time traveling mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet.\\
32 - Leonard: Fine. Then we'll just stay here and do it.\\
33 - Sheldon: Well, you didn't suggest a beach house.\\
34 - Leonard: You would go to a beach house?\\

2 - Bernadette: I like your suit.\\
3 - Penny: Oh, thanks. Got a couple new outfits for work.\\
4 - Howard: How does it feel knowing your fiancée's job is to go out and flirt with doctors, looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?\\
5 - Leonard: She doesn't flirt with doctors.\\
6 - Penny: Yeah. It's all very professional.\\
7 - Amy: You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?\\
8 - Penny: Okay, good.\\
9 - Bernadette: Speaking of new careers, how are things going with dark matter, Sheldon?\\
10 - Sheldon: Oh, yeah, I'd have to say it's the most exiting time in the history of the field.\\
11 - Bernadette: Oh. What's going on?\\
12 - Sheldon: I started doing it.\\
13 - Raj: You know, the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter.\\
14 - Leonard: Yeah, I've read about that, they're sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines.\\
15 - Raj: You know, Sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well.\\
16 - Penny: Wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?\\
17 - Sheldon: Why not?\\
18 - Penny: You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.\\
19 - Sheldon: Perhaps the emotion you're referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.\\
20 - Leonard: I think what Penny meant is, the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny, it's like a cat riding a Roomba.\\
21 - Howard:If they get scared, they'll have those hats with the lights on them, 'cause down there it's night-night all the time.\\
22 - Bernadette: Maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go (squeakily) ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.\\
23 - Leonard: Yeah, it'll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost.\\

2 - Bernadette: So, what are you working on these days?\\
3 - Amy: I'm studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.\\
4 - Bernadette: What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?\\
5 - Penny: Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear.\\
6 - Bermadette: Speaking of underwear, I have some interesting news.\\
7 - Penny: Okay, if it's sometimes Howie wears yours, Leonard already told us.\\
8 - Bernadette: He was being funny. I'm pretty sure. Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California. Isn't that cool?\\
9 - Amy: I think it's awful.\\
10 - Penny: Why would you say that?\\
11 - Amy: Bernadette is a successful microbiologist. She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. I mean, what kind of message does that send?\\
12 - Penny: I think the message is check out the rack on that scientist.\\
13 - Bernadette: Why can't someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?\\
14 - Amy: I just don't think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.\\
15 - Penny: Okay, what's the big deal? Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, I don't think it hurts to flirt a little. I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the girls.\\
16 - Amy: Maybe it's different in the world of sales, but it's already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science.\\
17 - Bernadette: I was kind of excited about the article, but now you're making me feel bad.\\
18 - Penny: No, I think you should do whatever you want. You know, maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them, I would've become a theoretical physicist. Stop smirking at each other.\\

3 - Howard: Oh, yeah, she loves that place. Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. That's why I don't take her to SeaWorld.\\
4 - Leonard: I know you-you don't want to hear it, but she was there with Stuart.\\
5 - Howard: That's fine. I don't care.\\
6 - Raj: It doesn't bug you when they go out on dates?\\
7 - Howard: They're not dating. They're just two friends who went out to dinner.\\
8 - Raj: And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.\\
9 - Howard: Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren't dating.\\
10 - Raj: Like who?\\
11 - Howard: Like you and your dog.\\
12 - Leonard: Don't rule out the dating.\\
13 - Howard: Fine, it bothers me. You happy?\\
14 - Sheldon: You think you've got problems. The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.\\
15 - Howard: How is this helpful?\\
16 - Sheldon: All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there's a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.\\
17 - Leonard: But the gibbon doesn't know what it's categorized as. It doesn't even know it's called a gibbon.\\

9 - Sheldon: Oh, Tesla.\\
10 - Penny: Hi.\\
11 - Amy: Hello.\\
12 - Sheldon: Hey, how did it go?\\
13 - Leonard: Oh, not fun. The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses.\\
14 - Penny: Yeah, I watched. It was like the scary boat tunnel in Willy Wonka.\\
15 - Amy: Did they figure out what's wrong?\\
16 - Leonard: Yeah. It's a deviated septum. The surgery to correct it is simple. He's gonna do it next week.\\
17 - Sheldon: Why would you have surgery?\\
18 - Leonard: Because I can't breathe. I snore, I get sinus infections.\\
19 - Penny: Yeah, back off, he's all mine.\\
20 - Sheldon: But you don't have a life-threatening condition. Why would you take the risk of surgery?\\
21 - Amy: Sheldon, it's a routine procedure, I've heard you complain about his snoring.\\
22 - Sheldon: Yes, for the first five or six years, but I've gotten used to it. It helps me sleep. He's like my mucus-powered white noise machine.\\
23 - Leonard: Sheldon, I'm gonna get the surgery, it's no big deal. End of story.\\
24 - Sheldon: Very well. I'm done talking about it.\\
25 - Leonard: Thank you.\\

3 - Amy: I know I was thinking that. Is this a show on flags or mind reading?\\
4 - Sheldon: But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend.\\
5 - Amy: And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board.\\
6 - Sheldon: So as they say, all good things must come to an end.\\

And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender, the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan, but I'm sure you remember that from episode sixty-two, White Flags, Who's Wavin' ‘Em and Why?\\

34 - Amy: I actually can't. My hips don't open wider than 22 degrees. I rode a very thin pony once. On the first bump, just popped right off.\\
35 - Penny: All right, well, what do you want to do?\\

43 - Penny: You were, but somehow I held myself back.\\
44 - Sheldon: You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating. The cold air will trigger Leonard's asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni.\\

11 - Sheldon: Aw, now I'm sad I didn't hear it.\\
12 - Penny: So what do you need the headphones for?\\
13 - Sheldon: Well, I've been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesn't make protons decay. I'm hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment. See, I've got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature. Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty. And then, oh, last but not least, this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade Richard Feynman.\\

52 - Sheldon: You sounded in distress. I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you. Like a murder. Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.\\
53 - Penny: Oh, I'm just doing this awful workout. I hate it.\\
54 - Sheldon: Well, if you hate it, then why are you doing it? Although I could ask the same question about coitus with Leonard.\\
55 - Penny: I don't know, I guess I like that I hate it. It makes me work harder.\\

65 - Raj: Go ahead, make fun. You can't embarrass me, I've got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater.\\
66 - Howard: Okay, who was he talking to, Emily or Cinnamon? "I want you to know, the bed feels so lonely when you're not in it."\\
67 - Raj: I may not be liking this game so much.\\
68 - Leonard: Cinnamon. Give me another one.\\
69 - Howard: Okay, Emily or Cinnamon? "Check it out, I got us matching sweaters!"\\
70 - Leonard: We all got the Christmas card, Cinnamon.\\
71 - Raj: You know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet. It's not strange.\\
72 - Leonard: Ooh, Emily. I heard him say that to Emily. Hey, I thought you were staying home.\\
73 - Sheldon: Yeah, I was, but after talking to Penny, I realised something. I, first, she's trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are. And second, the reason I may not be progressing in my research is I've created too pleasant of an environment for myself.\\
74 - Howard: What do you mean?\\
75 - Sheldon: According to a classic psychological experiment by Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety. So I'd like to ask you all to do something for me. Keep me on my toes. (stammers) Just throw me off my game. Essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable.\\
76 - Howard: Hold on. What's in it for us?\\
77 - Sheldon: Well, I suppose...\\
78 - Howard: Okay, we'll do it.\\
79 - [ Amy's laboratory ]\\
80 - Sheldon: Done.\\
81 - Amy: 33 seconds. Okay, that'll be our baseline.\\
82 - Sheldon: You know, I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet.\\
83 - Amy: It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.\\
84 - Sheldon: And his last meal was a food pellet? You're a monster.\\
85 - Amy: All right, next, we're gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate.\\
86 - Sheldon: Very well. And good luck, I'm a pretty laid-back guy.\\
87 - Amy: Ready? Begin. (squeezes balloon) Why'd you pop it?\\
88 - Sheldon: I'm sorry, I was aiming for your heart.\\
89 - Amy: Look, I know you don't like it, but that's the point of the experiment. I need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone. And you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana.\\
90 - Sheldon: Who eats them horizontally?\\
91 - Amy: My mother said that's how good girls do it.\\
92 - Sheldon: Perhaps this was a waste of time.\\
93 - Amy: Sheldon, you're a remarkable scientist. Just be patient, I'm sure you'll find the breakthrough you've been looking for.\\
94 - Sheldon: Thank you.\\
95 - Amy: And if you only do solid research instead of making a groundbreaking discovery, what does it matter?\\
96 - Sheldon: "Only do solid research"? I come to you for help, and you insult me? I thought the least that you would do would be...\\
97 - Amy: Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone.\\
98 - Sheldon: Really? Oh, that's fantastic. Now, wait, they're dropping. Why are they dropping?\\
99 - Amy: Because you're happy they're elevated.\\
100 - Sheldon: Oh, that is infuriating. Ooh, look, they went back up again. Terrific. Oh, no, they went back down.\\
101 - [ The apartment ]\\
102 - Raj: All right, guys, what game do you want to play?\\
103 - Howard: Let's see. How about "Emily or Cinnamon"?\\
104 - Raj: You know what? I think it's a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is, you're jealous of all my relationships.\\
105 - Howard: Oh, maybe I am. Who wouldn't want to be the girl, or possibly dog, to hear the words, "you're so lucky, you have the shiniest hair".\\
106 - Leonard: That is a tough one. Uh, I know he brushes both of them.\\
107 - Sheldon: Gentlemen, I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. I'd like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. From now on, when I make an assertion, I need you to challenge it.\\
108 - Leonard: So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?\\
109 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
110 - Raj: And you think that's going to help?\\
111 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
112 - Howard: Well, I don't think that's gonna help at all.\\
113 - Sheldon: Oh, no, it will. See, by keeping my mind engaged, I'll become more focused.\\
114 - Leonard: Howard's right, that'll never work.\\
115 - Sheldon: Stop fighting me on the premise. It's scientifically valid. I'm going to advance propositions, I just want you to challenge me.\\
116 - Raj: I don't think that's what you want at all.\\
117 - Sheldon: Why, of course it's what I want. Why would I say it's what I want if it's not what I want?\\
118 - Leonard: Because it is what you want, and it's not what you said.\\
119 - Sheldon: I ask you for one simple thing, and you can't even do it.\\
120 - Howard: Yes, we can.\\
121 - Sheldon: Yeah, well, then do it.\\
122 - Howard: Nah.\\
123 - Sheldon: You guys are the worst. Thank you, I think that was helpful.\\

126 - Amy: That would be so romantic for you and Leonard.\\
127 - Penny: Yeah, clearly you haven't seen him on the beach walking around with his metal detector.\\
128 - Amy: If I were going to Hawaii, I'd spend all my time at the Keck Observatory. Did you know that the telescopes there have better resolution than the Hubble?\\
129 - Penny: Really? Want to go to Hawaii?\\
130 - Sheldon: (knocking on door) Ladies? (Knocks) Ladies? (Knocks) Ladies?\\
131 - Penny: Come in.\\
132 - Sheldon: Ladies.\\
133 - Penny: What's up?\\
134 - Sheldon: Well, as you may know, I've been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels, and I thought, what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?\\
135 - Penny: What exactly do you think goes on here?\\
136 - Sheldon: Well, conversations that you wouldn't be comfortable having in front of the opposite s*x. You know, who has the best cervix. Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. Men's buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them.\\
137 - Bernadette: We were talking about Penny's job.\\
138 - Sheldon: And how difficult it is to do when she's bloated, cranky and crampy? Continue.\\
139 - Penny: Sheldon, we are just people. We talk about the same things you guys talk about.\\
140 - Sheldon: You talk about if werewolves can swim? See, Leonard says yes, but I say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten. What do you think?\\
141 - Penny: Let's just talk about our periods.\\
142 - Amy: No, hold on. All canines instinctively know how to swim. Why wouldn't a werewolf have the same abilities?\\
143 - Bernadette: Well, they're not a hundred percent wolf. They're a werewolf, that's only part wolf. It's like comparing apples to oranges.\\
144 - Sheldon: Thank you. Oh, and technically, it's apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full. Hey, this is fun. We should do it sometime when you aren't all PMS'ing. Bye.\\
145 - [ The apartment ]\\
146 - Leonard: What is going on?\\
147 - Sheldon: Oh. Uh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level, so I'm using Darth Vader, the Joker, and Godzilla's roar to keep me in that sweet spot. Uh, I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix, but turns out I love her.\\
148 - Leonard: Well, at least listen to it through headphones. I'm trying to sleep. Good night.\\
149 - Sheldon: Boy, Taylor was right, haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.\\
150 - [ Amy's apartment ]\\
151 - Amy: You've been working so much lately, I'm glad you didn't forget about date night.\\
152 - Sheldon: Of course.\\
153 - Amy: Sheldon.\\
154 - Sheldon: Yeah.\\
155 - Amy: Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.\\
156 - Sheldon: (stammers) I can do both. My brain is working at optimal capacity. I can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time.\\
157 - Amy: Fine. How was your day?\\
158 - Sheldon: Oh, you said it.\\
159 - Amy: Sheldon. Sheldon, I'm worried about you. You're not eating, you haven't slept in days, and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell.\\
160 - Sheldon: I know. It's replaced Godzilla as my principle source of anxiety.\\
161 - [ The apartment ]\\
162 - Howard: Okay, so it's one vote Emily, one vote Cinnamon. Penny, you're the tiebreaker.\\
163 - Penny: Say the quote again.\\
164 - Howard: "It's just so perfect that we're both Libras."\\
165 - Penny: Wow, this is hard. I'm gonna say Cinnamon.\\
166 - Howard: Yes.\\
167 - Penny: Yes.\\
168 - Raj: Come on.\\
169 - Howard: That was the last one, I promise. We won't play any more.\\
170 - Raj: Thank you. 'Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings.\\
171 - Bernadette: Emily's feelings?\\
172 - Raj: Yes, Emily. Whatever. Where's Sheldon?\\
173 - Penny: Date night.\\
174 - Leonard: That can't be much fun for Amy. You know, at work today, he tried his first Red Bull.\\
175 - Bernadette: What happened?\\
176 - Leonard: He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car.\\
177 - Bernadette: Don't you think you should make him stop all this?\\
178 - Howard: I don't know, he's not really hurting anybody.\\
179 - Leonard: You didn't have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.\\
180 - Sheldon: He is getting a lot of work done. He had a pretty interesting take on proton decay.\\
181 - Raj: Wow, if he cracks that it's a game changer, guys. It'll completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe.\\
182 - Howard: Hmm, it would. Okay, back to "Emily or Cinnamon"? "How can such a little girl eat such a big steak"?\\
183 - [ Amy's apartment ]\\
184 - Amy: Sheldon, I want you to take that cap off.\\
185 - Sheldon: That nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah. But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill, that'd really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah.\\
186 - Amy: I'm sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night.\\
187 - Sheldon: There you go, perfect.\\
188 - Amy: Sheldon, stop it, I'm not kidding. Take the cap off, and put the notebook away.\\
189 - Sheldon: But after months of struggling, I'm finally making progress.\\
190 - Amy: You don't need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.\\
191 - Sheldon: Or do I, hmm? Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia while convinced he was an armadillo.\\
192 - Amy: That's not true.\\
193 - Sheldon: Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I have been hallucinating lately.\\
194 - Amy: Sheldon, this has to stop. You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself.\\
195 - Sheldon: Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have since I made the switch to dark matter. What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?\\
196 - Amy: Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety.\\
197 - Sheldon: Hmm, perhaps. But I'm not taking the cap off.\\
198 - Amy: It's one thing to make yourself miserable, but you're making everyone around you miserable, too. Now, I'm telling you for the last time, take the cap off.\\
199 - Sheldon: Oh, really? What if I don't? And before you answer that, can I have my dessert?\\
200 - [ A bus ]\\
201 - Sheldon: And then she threw me out. Me, her very own boyfriend. When all I've done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in.\\
202 - Man: Yeah, well, women, what are you gonna do?\\
203 - Sheldon: I knew you'd understand, Armadillo Isaac Newton.\\
204 - [ Sheldon's bedroom ]\\
205 - Penny: Okay.\\
206 - Leonard: Here we are.\\
207 - Sheldon: Hey. What are you trying to pull? The president of science isn't in here.\\
208 - Leonard: You lie down, he'll be here in a minute.\\
209 - Sheldon: Okay. Hey, I thought you were trying to trick me.\\
210 - Penny: Now, you just get comfortable.\\
211 - Sheldon: No, no, comfort is the enemy. You know what's comfortable? Slippers and blankets and panda bears. Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman's face on it. Warm up the car, Leonard, it's poster time.\\
212 - Leonard: Maybe in the morning.\\
213 - Penny: Yeah, you get some sleep.\\
214 - Sheldon: No, I don't want to go to sleep, you can't make me.\\
215 - Penny: You're right, we can't.\\
216 - Sheldon: Yeah, darn straight, you can't. Try to tell a grown man to go to sleep.\\
217 - Penny:  Soft kitty, warm kitty \\
218 - Leonard:  Little ball of fur... \\
219 - Sheldon: That's not gonna work.\\
220 - Penny (singing):  Happy kitty, sleepy kitty \\
221 - Together (singing):  Purr, purr, purr. \\
222 - Leonard: You know, he can be a lot of trouble, but when I see him lying here asleep like this, I just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face.\\
223 - Penny: Mmmm.\\
224 - [ The cafeteria ]\\
225 - Howard: You look like you got some rest.\\
226 - Sheldon: Oh, I'm feeling much better. And I've also been continuing to make progress without artificially raising my anxiety levels.\\
227 - Leonard: I turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out, so my levels, right up there.\\
228 - Raj: Hey, guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?\\
229 - Leonard: Yeah, sure.\\
230 - Howard: Yeah, no problem.\\
231 - Sheldon: Of course not.\\
232 - Emily: So I hear you guys have been playing a little game.\\
233 - Howard: Well, um, we were just kidding around.\\
234 - Emily: Well, you may think it's funny that Raj is sweet and sensitive, but I think it's sexy. Ugh, why is there dog hair in your mouth?
\subsection {Episode 14: The Troll Manifestation}
1 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
2 - Penny: So, tell me about your day, how's it going with the particle detector?\\
3 - Leonard: Wow, you remember that?\\
4 - Penny: Yeah, I listen to what you say. You're building a particle detector using superfluid helium.\\
5 - Leonard: You know, when you talk like that, I want to take you right here on this table.\\
6 - Penny: And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. So, how's the detector going?\\
7 - Leonard: Well, it's tricky working with superfluids. Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own.\\
8 - Penny: Kind of like Sheldon's ant farm.\\
9 - Leonard: Exactly, except you don't have a lunatic running around, yelling, I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me? Come on, this is boring, you really want to talk about this?\\
10 - Penny: No, I do. I-I didn't write "superfluid helium" on this napkin for nothing.\\
11 - Leonard: Okay, well, this is cool. Uh, there's a thing called "superfluid vacuum theory", where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tension...\\
12 - Penny: Hey, if you're pausing for dramatic effect, I'd keep it moving.\\
13 - Leonard: No, no. People don't talk about surface tension. If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble... This is exciting. This is really exciting. I have to go find Sheldon.\\
14 - Penny: Okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you.\\
15 - [ The apartment ]\\
16 - Leonard: Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time. So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?\\
17 - Sheldon: Hmm.\\
18 - Leonard: What? Is it wrong? Have you seen it somewhere else?\\
19 - Sheldon: Hmm.\\
20 - Leonard: I know this isn't my area, and I could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?\\
21 - Sheldon: Well, (sighs) (stammers) you could have set Newton's gravitational constant to one. And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry. You know I can't stand these scented markers.\\
22 - Leonard: No one told you to taste them. Come on, is, is this good or not?\\
23 - Sheldon: It's good.\\
24 - Leonard: Really?\\
25 - Sheldon: I like it. I think you're on to something.\\
26 - Leonard: You do? You're not messing with me?\\
27 - Sheldon: Not at all. In fact, I have got something for just such an occasion. I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you. Good job.\\
28 - Leonard: You're giving me a sticker?\\
29 - Sheldon: Not just a sticker. That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow.\\
30 - Leonard: I'm not a preschooler.\\
31 - Sheldon: (stammers) Fine, I'll take it back.\\
32 - Leonard: I earned this. Back off.\\

45 - Original Air Date on February 5, 2015\\
46 - [ The apartment ]\\
47 - Leonard: You're still awake?\\
48 - Sheldon: For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, "you're still awake" seems like quite the sophomore slump.\\
49 - Leonard: You worked out all the math.\\
50 - Sheldon: Oh, I did more than work out all the math. I wrote a paper.\\
51 - Leonard: You wrote a paper on my idea?\\
52 - Sheldon: I wrote a paper on our idea.\\
53 - Leonard: When did my idea become our idea?\\
54 - Sheldon: When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy-Bake oven of my mind.\\
55 - Leonard: This is good. Our idea is really good.\\
56 - Sheldon: Well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright.\\
57 - Leonard: You know, if no one's thought of this, yet, this could be a big deal.\\
58 - Sheldon: Only way we'll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server. I have it ready to go, but I wasn't gonna do it without you.\\
59 - Leonard: Wow, it's all happening so fast. Should we just sleep on it?\\
60 - Sheldon: We could, but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch.\\
61 - Leonard: You're sure it's good?\\
62 - Sheldon: My name is right on there with yours. That is a surefire mark of quality. That might as well say "directed by Joss Whedon".\\
63 - Leonard: Okay, partner, let's do it.\\
64 - Sheldon: Come on. Click the mouse with me.\\
65 - Leonard: One, two three.\\
66 - Together: Click.\\
67 - Leonard: Well, we did it.\\
68 - Sheldon: Yes, we did, my friend.\\
69 - Leonard: Is your tongue blue?\\
70 - Sheldon: I don't want to talk about it.\\
71 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
72 - Bernadette: Okay, movie night, what do you want to watch?\\
73 - Amy: Whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?\\
74 - Penny: Oh, God. Probably nothing. I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.\\
75 - Bernadette: Search for it.\\
76 - Penny: What, no, why?\\
77 - Bernadette: 'Cause it would be fun to watch.\\
78 - Penny: It would be humiliating.\\
79 - Bernadette: Well, now we have two reasons.\\
80 - Amy: They have it.\\
81 - Bernadette: Please, can we watch it?\\
82 - Amy: (sighs) Please?\\
83 - Penny: Fine, but I'm telling you, it's terrible.\\
84 - Amy: Have you even seen it?\\
85 - Penny: No.\\
86 - Bernadette: Well, maybe it turned out better than you think.\\
87 - (bike bell rings on TV)\\
88 - Voice on TV: Bananas, get your fresh bananas.\\
89 - Bernadette: (laughing) It really didn't.\\
90 - [ Leonard's laboratory ]\\
91 - Leonard: Sheldon, this is superfluid helium. Put this in your mouth, your tongue will freeze and break off.\\
92 - Sheldon: Does it smell like blueberries?\\
93 - Leonard: No.\\
94 - Sheldon: Then we're probably okay.\\
95 - Howard: Hey, your paper got mentioned on the Quantum Diaries physics blog.\\
96 - Leonard: (gasps) Really? What'd they say?\\
97 - Howard: Uh, it's basically a summary of the theory, but there's a bunch of positive comments on the message board.\\
98 - Leonard: Let me see, let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. We're insightful and innovative.\\
99 - Sheldon: Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.\\
100 - Leonard: Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative. Uh, another one says, "The concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking". Do you hear that, Mr. Out-Of-The?\\
101 - Sheldon: I do, indeed, Mr. Box-Thinking.\\
102 - Howard: How are you today, Mr. Can-You-Believe-These-Jack-Asses?\\
103 - Raj: Just dandy, Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv.\\
104 - Sheldon: Read another one.\\
105 - Leonard: Okay, okay. Uh, "The analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish."\\
106 - Sheldon: Who wrote that?\\
107 - Leonard: It's anonymous, and user name "General Relativity".\\
108 - Sheldon: Well, I'm responding to it.\\
109 - Leonard: Uh, don't lower yourself to their level.\\
110 - Sheldon: Look, I am simply going to defend our work, scientist to scientist. And failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers.\\
111 - Leonard: Sheldon, my name's on that paper, too. There's no upside to doing this.\\
112 - Sheldon: He just left another comment.\\
113 - Raj: What does it say?\\
114 - Leonard: "Upon review, I've changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. In fact, it's inspired me to come up with my own theory. Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket, much like Cooper and Hofstadter."\\
115 - Sheldon: Can I respond now?\\
116 - Leonard: Do it.\\
117 - Sheldon: You mess with the bull, you get the horns. I'm about to show this guy just how horny I can be.\\
118 - Leonard: Somebody else do it.\\
119 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
120 - Penny (on TV): Doctor, please help me. I think I might be turning into a killer gorilla.\\
121 - Doctor: Why do you think you're turning into a killer gorilla and not just a regular gorilla?\\
122 - Penny (on TV): Because regular gorillas are vegetarians, and I just bit the fingers off your receptionist.\\
123 - (Penny screeching like an ape; chaotic clattering)\\
124 - Penny: Okay, we've seen plenty.\\
125 - Bernadette: No, give me the remote.\\
126 - Amy: Careful. She'll bite your fingers off.\\
127 - Penny: Okay, well, I've been poking around the internet, and I think I found something we'll enjoy watching even more.\\
128 - Amy: What is it?\\
129 - Penny: Oh, just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant.\\
130 - Amy: What?\\
131 - Bernadette: Okay, I learned my lesson. Making fun of people is wrong.\\
132 - Amy: I haven't learned my lesson. Play it. Play it.\\
133 - Bernadette (on screen): Hi. I'm Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski from Yorba Linda, California.\\
134 - Penny: You look like a talking cupcake.\\
135 - Bernadette (on screen): And you should pick me for Miss California Quiznos 1999, because I want to...  tell you what I want, what I really really want, l tell you what I want, what I really really want, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna Really, really, really be Miss California Quiznos 1999! \\
136 - Amy: Play it again. Play it again.\\
137 - [ The apartment ]\\
138 - Raj: Did he respond yet?\\
139 - Sheldon: Hmm. No, not yet.\\
140 - Leonard: Well, maybe we shouldn't have sunk to his level.\\
141 - Howard: It wasn't that bad.\\
142 - Leonard: Read it back one more time.\\
143 - Sheldon: (clears throat) "My good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. In fact, we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. And later tonight, your mother."\\
144 - Leonard: And you don't think that's too rough?\\
145 - Sheldon: We're just standing behind her. It's not like we're gonna say boo and scare her.\\
146 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
147 - Penny: How could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants?\\
148 - Bernadette: 'Cause it's embarrassing.\\
149 - Penny: (laughing) It is; it truly is.\\
150 - Bernadette: Yeah, well, Amy writes Little House on the Prairie fan fiction about herself and posts it on the Internet.\\
151 - Penny: No.\\
152 - Amy: Why? What did I do?\\
153 - Bernadette: Sorry, I had to get the spotlight off me, and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training.\\
154 - Penny: Okay. We are reading that right now.\\
155 - Amy: No, please don't.\\
156 - Bernadette: We got embarrassed tonight. Come on.\\
157 - Amy: But it's personal.\\
158 - Penny: Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?\\
159 - Amy: (chuckles) No.\\
160 - Penny: Oh, my God, it's about her and Sheldon.\\
161 - Amy: It's not about me and Sheldon. It's about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia, and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper she falls in love with.\\
162 - Penny: Please show us?\\
163 - Bernadette: Please?\\
164 - Amy: No.\\
165 - Penny: You know I'm gonna read it either way.\\
166 - Amy: (scoffs) Good luck finding it.\\
167 - Penny: Amelia and the time-trav... found it! (chuckles) It was just past dawn on the prairie, and like every morning, Amelia prepared to do her chores. Except something about this morning felt different.\\
168 - Bernadette: Why? Why did it feel different?\\
169 - Penny: "Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air, or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. A man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings."\\
170 - (Penny and Bernadette squealing)\\
171 - Amy: You know, there was a time when I was alone and had no friends. I'm starting to miss that.\\
172 - [ The apartment ]\\
173 - Sheldon: He still hasn't responded. What's taking him so long?\\
174 - Leonard: Do you really want him to write back?\\
175 - Sheldon: Yeah, I do. Then no matter how he responds, I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying, "Oh, really?"\\
176 - Leonard: Me-wow.\\
177 - Howard: What are you doing?\\
178 - Raj: I've, uh, created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper.\\
179 - Howard: "This wee li'l bairn of a theory nearly blew my kilt off."\\
180 - Raj: No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. (Scottish accent) "This wee li'l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off."\\
181 - Sheldon: (gasps) He wrote back. "Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech, essentially a technical school, where even the physicists are basically engineers." (gasps) "Engineers"? Do you know how insulting that is?\\
182 - Howard: Yes.\\
183 - Raj: Guys, this person's just going out of their way to get a rise out of you.\\
184 - Sheldon: Yeah, but it's still so aggravating.\\
185 - Raj: Yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those.\\
186 - Howard: Yeah. Dr. Dmitri Plancovik of Moscow University said, (Russian accent) "Dis paper great, I love it more than wodka".\\
187 - Raj: See? Better with the accent.\\
188 - Sheldon: And send.\\
189 - Leonard: What did you write?\\
190 - Sheldon: I'm done hiding from bullies. I'm taking this into the real world.\\
191 - Leonard: What does that mean?\\
192 - Sheldon: I told him we'll meet him face-to-face anytime, anywhere.\\
193 - Leonard: Are you crazy? You don't know who this person is. Delete that.\\
194 - Raj: Come on, Sheldon!\\
195 - Sheldon: Oh, okay, okay, calm down. (electronic tones play) (gasps) It's him. He's trying to video chat. Perhaps I shouldn't have taken this into the real world.\\
196 - Leonard: Oh, really?\\
197 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
198 - Penny: "'Time travel? I don't understand,' said Amelia. Cooper stared at her. 'Which word don't you understand, time or travel?'"\\
199 - Bernadette: Wow, even in your fantasies Sheldon's kind of exhausting.\\
200 - Amy: He's like that in the beginning, so she can change him. It's called good writing. And wishful thinking.\\
201 - Penny: "It stung Amelia when he spoke to her this way. In her little one-room schoolhouse, she was always the smartest student, regularly besting the boys in her class, but this was no boy in front of her, this was a man."\\
202 - Bernadette: Here we go.\\
203 - Penny: "Cooper told Amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold, like computers and living past 30. He asked her if she had any questions. All she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers, but she was too afraid to hear the answer."\\
204 - Bernadette: Oh, Amelia.\\
205 - Penny: "So instead she asked if, in the future, Montana ever became a state."\\
206 - Amy: In the 1800s that was considered flirting.\\
207 - [ The apartment ]\\
208 - Raj: I'm so sick of people being mean on the Internet.\\
209 - Howard: Well, I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they'd never say to your face.\\
210 - Sheldon: Interesting. I can't think of a single thing I wouldn't say to someone's face.\\
211 - Leonard: Never noticed that about you.\\
212 - Raj: You know what? At least you guys did something. You know, you, you had a theory, you wrote a paper, you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people's work.\\
213 - Sheldon: He's right. I say we call this person back. We've got no reason to hide.\\
214 - Leonard: All right, do it. Call him. Let's find out what this loser's ever accomplished.\\
215 - Sheldon: Click it with me. One, two, three, click.\\
216 - (line ringing)\\
217 - Stephen Hawking: Well, hello there.\\
218 - Sheldon: Professor Hawking?\\
219 - Stephen Hawking: Oh, brother, you should see the look on your faces.\\
220 - Leonard: You really didn't like our paper?\\
221 - Stephen Hawking: I like your paper very much. The premise is intriguing.\\
222 - Sheldon: Then why are you attacking us?\\
223 - Stephen Hawking: If you were sitting in a chair for 40 years, you'd get bored, too. Anyway, got to go. I promised to help the neighbour kid with his maths homework. Ciao.\\
224 - Leonard: Stephen Hawking liked our paper. (chuckles softly) Said the premise is intriguing.\\
225 - Sheldon: Good to see you again, Mr. Stephen-Hawking Liked-Our-Paper.\\
226 - Leonard: And you as well, Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing.\\
227 - Howard: How do you do, Mr. I'll-Admit-That's-Pretty-Cool?\\
228 - Raj: Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure.\\
229 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
230 - Penny: "With a heavy heart, Amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine. She regretted giving Cooper the part he needed."\\
231 - Bernadette: Because she wanted him to give her the part she needed.\\
232 - Amy: Okay, that's enough.\\
233 - Penny: What? No, I really want to know what happens, and Bernadette really, really, really wants to know what happens.\\
234 - Amy: You're just making fun of me.\\
235 - Bernadette: I was just kidding. I'm sorry. And the story's really good.\\
236 - Penny: No, it is. Does he stay? Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?\\
237 - Bernadette: Please?\\
238 - Amy: Fine. "As Cooper prepared to depart, tears filled Amelia's eyes. He took her hand in his and said, 'I can't stay, but I will never forget you.' He brushed his fingers against her cheek, then quickly stepped into the machine. 'Please don't go,' she whispered. But it was too late. The engine hummed to life."\\
239 - Bernadette: But they didn't even kiss.\\
240 - Amy: "She turned away, wiping her eyes. She couldn't bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever. Then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around. It was Cooper."\\
241 - Penny: (gasps) Yes.\\
242 - Amy: "'What about the future?' asked Amelia. He looked deeply into her eyes and whispered, 'There is no future without you.' He pulled her in close. She began to tremble all over. She felt his warm breath..."\\
243 - Leonard: You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said.\\
244 - Penny: Get out!\\
245 - Bernadette: Not now!\\
246 - [ An 1800's house ]\\
247 - Amelia: Is the water warm enough?\\
248 - Cooper: Given the fact that you took the time to build a wood fire, draw the water from the well and heat it, it would be rude to complain. But since you asked, it's a little nippy.\\
249 - Amelia: I can fix that. I couldn't help but notice your unusual undergarments.\\
250 - Cooper: They're not undergarments. They're Underoos. Where I come from, they're known as underwear that's fun to wear.\\
251 - Amelia: And what's the significance of the spider?\\
252 - Cooper: Oh, that represents Spider-Man. He does whatever a spider can.\\
253 - Amelia: There's a lot of rhyming in the future, isn't there?\\
254 - Leonard: You're right. This is even weirder than I thought.\\
255 - Penny: You want me to stop reading?\\
256 - Leonard: Are you kidding? No, no.\\
257 - Penny: "As he stood for Amelia to dry him..."\\
258 - Amelia: So, tell me, Cooper, are the ways of physical love different in the future?\\
259 - Leonard: Yeah, okay, I'm good.

2 - Sheldon: I've invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?\\
3 - Amy: Sure.\\
4 - Sheldon: How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?\\
5 - Amy: How many?\\
6 - Sheldon: Who cares? He stole the idea and doesn't deserve his own joke.\\
7 - Amy: Is that really true?\\
8 - Sheldon: Of course, that's how you know it's a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs.\\
9 - Barry: Hey, sowwy to intewupt.\\
10 - Sheldon: Uh, Barry, uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?\\
11 - Barry: Did you know Edison didn't actuawy invent the wight bulb?\\
12 - Sheldon: What do you want, Barry?\\
13 - Barry: Just wanted to dwop this off as a wittle thank you for Amy.\\
14 - Amy: What's this for?\\
15 - Barry: Your idea weawy hewped me out. My wight-cone quantization paper's onwine alweady. The wesponse has been amazing.\\
16 - Amy: Well, that's fascinating. I can't wait to read it.\\
17 - Sheldon: Oh, no, me as well. Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz. Why dot biz? Because I just gave you the business. And also bazinga dot com was taken.\\
18 - Barry: Anyway, thanks again. Cooper, suck eggs.\\
19 - Sheldon: Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?\\
20 - Amy: Well, I'd been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and I thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, it's not a big deal.\\
21 - Sheldon: Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn't you try to help me?\\
22 - Amy: I did. You said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs.\\
23 - Sheldon: That's pretty funny, that does sound like me. But that doesn't mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along.\\
24 - Amy: Sheldon, we're all scientists. I helped out a fellow colleague. You're being petty.\\
25 - Sheldon: I'm being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him, he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends, he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?\\

40 - Howard (on phone): Okay, Ma. Say hi to Aunt Gladys. Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.\\
41 - Bernadette: Your mom having fun in Florida?\\
42 - Howard: Mmm, she loves it. She finally found a place where everyone talks about how sweaty they are. Anyway, she wants us to go to the house and check in on Stuart because he might be lonely.\\
43 - Bernadette: She's just being nice.\\
44 - Howard: Well, I'm her son, how come she doesn't send someone to check on me if I'm lonely?\\
45 - Bernadette: Because you have a wife.\\
46 - Howard: Yeah, well, sometimes you work late.\\
47 - Bernadette: I know you don't like Stuart being in the house, but the store's about to reopen, I'm sure he'll get back on his feet.\\
48 - Howard: That would be great. I'd love for things between me and Mom to get back to normal.\\
49 - Bernadette: Well, normal's a strong word, but sure.\\
50 - [ The laundry room ]\\
51 - Penny: Hey.\\
52 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
53 - Penny: You okay?\\
54 - Sheldon: If I was okay, I would've said hello, and not the much more ominous hello.\\
55 - Penny: What's going on?\\
56 - Sheldon: I'm mad at Amy.\\
57 - Penny: Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?\\
58 - Sheldon: No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.\\
59 - Penny: Oh, that sounds like a good thing.\\
60 - Sheldon: Well, it would be, except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival, no less. I'm sorry you had to see that.\\
61 - Penny: I'm sorry I didn't have a camera.\\
62 - Sheldon: Why would she do this to me?\\
63 - Penny: Well, I'm sure she didn't upset you on purpose. Besides, aren't you the one who says there's nothing more important than the advancement of science?\\
64 - Sheldon: No, I said there's nothing more important than me advancing science.\\
65 - Penny: All right, well, if I'm understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, I'm thinking you might have to let this one go.\\
66 - Sheldon: Ugh, let it go. I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it's my fault, and it's not okay to feel the way I feel.\\
67 - Penny: I don't know what to tell you. I mean, why don't you talk to her?\\
68 - Sheldon: Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? Gee, Penny, life's giving me lemons. What should I do?\\
69 - Penny: Well, you could shove them somewhere.\\
70 - Sheldon: Okay, now you're getting creative.\\
71 - [ The comic book store ]\\
72 - Stuart: Thanks again for your help.\\
73 - Leonard: No problem.\\
74 - Raj: Our pleasure.\\
75 - Leonard: The place really looks great.\\
76 - Raj: Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago.\\
77 - Stuart: I keep telling you I didn't burn it down.\\
78 - Leonard: We know, we know, because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime.\\
79 - Bernadette: Stuart, this place looks amazing.\\
80 - Stuart: Thanks.\\
81 - Howard: You really did a nice job.\\
82 - Stuart: And thank you for putting up with me staying at your mom's through all this. I couldn't have done it otherwise.\\
83 - Howard: I appreciate that, and I'm glad you were able to... is that my mother's furniture?\\
84 - Stuart: Yeah, she said I could use it. Doesn't it look great?\\
85 - Howard: Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.\\
86 - Bernadette: Howie.\\
87 - Howard: Why don't you just clean out the whole room? Take the string art clown I made her in third grade and the ribbon I got in swim class for putting my face in the water.\\
88 - Stuart: What is your problem? She said it was okay.\\
89 - Howard: Well, I'm her son, and I say it's not okay.\\
90 - Stuart: Some son, looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art.\\
91 - Howard: Well, maybe I should've gone to a fancy art school like you. Then I could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy's mother.\\
92 - Bernadette: Why don't we leave so you can cool off?\\
93 - Stuart: I think that's a good idea. Take him out of my store.\\
94 - Howard: Your store? My mother gave you the money to reopen. I'm not going anywhere.\\
95 - Leonard: Why don't we go get the food for the party.\\
96 - Stuart: Thank you.\\
97 - Raj: Smart, looks like we're being helpful.\\
98 - Leonard: Mmm, when really we're just exiting an uncomfortable situation.\\
99 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
100 - Sheldon: Kripke, you know, of all the people, Barry Kripke. I'm so... Are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you?\\
101 - Penny: No.\\
102 - Sheldon: Oh, give me that. Just out of curiosity, if I were to let something go, how would I do that?\\
103 - Penny: I don't know, just think about something else.\\
104 - Sheldon: Can I think about the spiny anteater?\\
105 - Penny: Sure.\\
106 - Sheldon: The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke. That didn't help at all.\\
107 - Penny: You know, some people try visualization.\\
108 - Sheldon: How does that work?\\
109 - Penny: Okay, imagine your problems are a pen.\\
110 - Sheldon: Okay.\\
111 - Penny: Now imagine you're holding that pen.\\
112 - Sheldon: Okay.\\
113 - Penny: Now open your hand and let it go.\\
114 - Sheldon: But I just got this pen. It's got my initials on it and everything. Look.\\
115 - Penny: Sheldon, this isn't that hard.\\
116 - Sheldon: I may have a better way that you can teach me.\\
117 - Penny: How?\\
118 - Sheldon: What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?\\
119 - Penny: What? She didn't give me any puzzles.\\
120 - Sheldon: Are you sure?\\
121 - Amy (in flashback): Boy, I just can't seem to get these scissors back together. Can you do it?\\
122 - Amy (in flashback): Darn it. There's something in my eye, and I need to sort these coins by size. Can you help?\\
123 - Amy (in flashback): Penny? I really want to eat this banana, but it's stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box.\\
124 - Penny: Son of a bitch.\\
125 - Sheldon: Okay, that's great. Now, let it go.\\
126 - Penny: I can't believe you were testing me against a chimp.\\
127 - Sheldon: Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box, by the way.\\
128 - Penny: Why would she even do this?\\
129 - Sheldon: She's been conducting an experiment on apes where they're given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn't be able to solve them. That's when Amy said, want to make this interesting?\\
130 - Penny: Make this interesting? You bet money on me?\\
131 - Sheldon: No, no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now, isn't that interesting?\\
132 - Penny: It's not interesting. It's incredibly insulting.\\
133 - Sheldon: Okay, maybe this will help. Imagine you're holding a pen. Before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that'll make the next part really hard.\\
134 - Penny: Oh, my, that's it. Get out.\\
135 - Sheldon: I don't understand why you're mad at me. You should be mad at Amy. Like I was this afternoon. Hey, look at that, I let it go.\\
136 - Penny: Get out.\\
137 - Sheldon: Penny?\\
138 - Penny: What?\\
139 - Sheldon: I think I left my pen in there.\\
140 - [ The comic book store ]\\
141 - Bernadette: I understand why you're upset, but he worked really hard to get the store ready. And it's just furniture.\\
142 - Howard: It's my mom's furniture. It belongs in the house I grew up in, next to that pile of TV Guides and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old, was a quality piece of string art.\\
143 - Bernadette: Howie, if the store succeeds, Stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your mother's house. Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that.\\
144 - Howard: That is a good point. But I didn't marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I'm being.\\
145 - Bernadette: This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.\\
146 - [ A deli ]\\
147 - Leonard: Hi, we're here to pick up an order for Comic Center.\\
148 - Waitress: Sure, let me go check on that.\\
149 - Raj: Dude, I, I think that's Nathan Fillion.\\
150 - Leonard: Oh yeah, look at that.\\
151 - Raj: And he's picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh, I have got an idea.\\
152 - Leonard: We're not selling his tomatoes on eBay.\\
153 - Raj: No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart's store, that would be amazing.\\
154 - Leonard: That would be great.\\
155 - Raj: So should we go talk to him?\\
156 - Leonard: I don't know. I mean, if he's not nice, it's gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again.\\
157 - Raj: What? The, the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk. We still watch Game of Thrones.\\
158 - Leonard: He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.\\
159 - Raj: I was distracted. It's weird seeing a member of the Night's Watch with a kayak strapped to his car. Come on. Hi, excuse me, s, sorry, I, I don't mean to bother you, but we're just really big fans of Firefly. And Dr. Horrible.\\
160 - Nathan Fillion: Oh, uh, I think you made a mistake. I'm not an actor.\\
161 - Raj: Don't say that. I mean, you're not Dame Judi Dench, but you're pretty great.\\
162 - Nathan Fillion: Oh, yeah, I get it, you think I'm Nathan Fillion, but I'm not. So if you don't mind, I would just love to eat my lunch.\\
163 - Leonard: Come on. Sorry to bother you.\\
164 - Raj: Don't know why he's so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once, and I'm still floating.\\
165 - [ The hallway ]\\
166 - Amy: Sheldon, it's me.\\
167 - Penny: Oh, hey. Did you see that? I, I figured out how to open the door all by myself. Maybe I'll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate.\\
168 - Amy: What are you talking about?\\
169 - Penny: I know you've been giving me secret puzzle tests.\\
170 - Amy: Sheldon, open the door.\\
171 - Sheldon: I can't. I'm naked.\\
172 - Amy: I just saw you.\\
173 - Sheldon: Hang on.\\
174 - Penny: Open the door now.\\
175 - Amy: Oh, hey.\\
176 - Penny: Pull up your pants.\\
177 - Amy: It's not a big deal. I run tests like this on undergrads all the time. If you fill out some paperwork at the university, I can get you five dollars.\\
178 - Penny: I don't want five dollars. I want my dignity.\\
179 - Amy: So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?\\
180 - [ The deli ]\\
181 - Leonard: Thank you.\\
182 - Raj: Thanks.\\
183 - Leonard: Sorry again.\\
184 - Nathan Fillion: No problem.\\
185 - Raj: Are you sure you're not him? Uh, you can tell us. We're scientists, not crazy fanboys.\\
186 - Nathan Fillion: All right, fine. I'm him.\\
187 - Raj: And you're eating alone at a deli. I don't buy it, you're not him.\\
188 - Nathan Fillion: I just wanted to eat my lunch in peace. But I really am him. And thank you very much for being a fan. If you want, uh, let's take a picture.\\
189 - Leonard: That would be great.\\
190 - Raj: Great.\\
191 - Leonard: Yeah, thank you.\\
192 - Nathan Fillion: You bet.\\
193 - Raj: Wait, hang on. If you're really Nathan Fillion, what's the line from Firefly about your bonnet?\\
194 - Nathan Fillion: I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you.\\
195 - Leonard: That's it, that's the line.\\
196 - Raj: Although, I knew the line, doesn't make me Nathan Fillion.\\
197 - Nathan Fillion: Do you want the picture or not?\\
198 - Raj: I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.\\
199 - Nathan: How about a picture with a guy who looks like Nathan Fillion but a little more annoyed than Nathan Fillion usually is?\\
200 - Leonard: What do you think?\\
201 - Raj: Ah, it's good enough for Facebook.\\
202 - [ The comic book store ]\\
203 - Leonard: I can't believe they did that.\\
204 - Penny: I know, it's so insulting. At one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.\\
205 - Leonard: Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box. He was testing me, too.\\
206 - Penny: Unbelievable.\\
207 - Leonard: And how could a chimp even solve that? That was impossible.\\
208 - Penny: Really? You couldn't get it out?\\
209 - Sheldon: Thank you.\\
210 - Amy: Wow, the store looks great.\\
211 - Leonard: So you guys were testing us both? What is the matter with you?\\
212 - Penny: Eh, what's the matter with them is they think they're so smart they don't care if they hurt other people's feelings.\\
213 - Amy: That's not true.\\
214 - Sheldon: That sounds like us. I still don't understand why you're upset. You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.\\
215 - Amy: Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall.\\
216 - Howard: I'm sorry, but it's making me crazy.\\
217 - Bernadette: Can you please just let it go?\\
218 - Sheldon: Oh, I can help you with that. Imagine you're holding an ordinary pen. While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket.\\
219 - Howard: Hold that thought. (On phone) Hello?\\
220 - Amy: How can I make this up to you?\\
221 - Penny: The answer's in this puzzle box. Let's see if you can open it.\\
222 - Stuart: You could have at least warned him about the furniture.\\
223 - Raj: That's what I said when we moved it.\\
224 - Bernadette: You helped him?\\
225 - Raj: No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.\\
226 - Leonard: Hey, you okay?\\
227 - Howard: No.\\
228 - Leonard: What's wrong?\\
229 - Howard: My mom died.\\
230 - Bernadette: What?\\
231 - Howard: Uh, that was my aunt. Ma took a nap. She never woke up.\\
232 - Bernadette: Oh, my God, Howie.\\
233 - Leonard: I'm so sorry.\\
234 - Raj: What can we do?\\
235 - Howard: I don't know.\\
236 - Sheldon: May I say something?\\
237 - Leonard: Not right now, Sheldon.\\
238 - Sheldon: But I think it would be comforting.\\
239 - Leonard: Buddy.\\
240 - Howard: No, it's okay. What?\\
241 - Sheldon: When I lost my own father, I didn't have any friends to help me through it. You do.\\
242 - Penny: I really thought he was gonna say let it go.\\
243 - [ The apartment ]\\
244 - Raj (on phone): Okay, thanks, Bernadette. Travel safe. Okay, bye. Well, they've booked a flight. They're heading to the airport now.\\
245 - Penny: How's Howard holding up?\\
246 - Raj: He's hanging in there.\\
247 - Leonard: How are you doing, Stuart?\\
248 - Stuart: Still can't believe she's gone. I mean, that woman took me in. If it wasn't for her, I, I would have been homeless.\\
249 - Amy: One of us would have taken you in.\\
250 - Stuart: Yeah, I don't recall any offers. But, you know what, uh, I, I'm glad it worked out the way it did because I got to know this wonderful person.\\
251 - Raj: Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America, Howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought I was the gardener.\\
252 - Penny: Whenever I saw her, she'd say I was too skinny and try and feed me.\\
253 - Amy: She did that to me, too.\\
254 - Penny: Don't take this away from me.\\
255 - Sheldon: I didn't care for her yelling. But now that I'm not going to hear it again, I'm sad.\\
256 - Leonard: If you want, I can yell at you later.\\
257 - Sheldon: It won't be as good.\\
258 - Leonard: Let's have a toast. To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother to all of us. We'll miss you.

2 - Amy: I just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours.\\
3 - Leonard: That doesn't sound right. My research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging.\\
4 - Penny: Honey, neither of us comes off good in that story.\\
5 - Raj: Yeah, I-I... I saw that article you're talking about. Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy.\\
6 - Amy: And then they finish it off by staring into each other's eyes for four minutes.\\
7 - Sheldon: Oh, that's nonsense. I proclaimed my love for you. And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.\\
8 - Amy: Other than the fact that I had it, that was a magical night.\\
9 - Penny: Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?\\
10 - Raj: What? I don't need science to win her heart. I have my family's wealth for that.\\
11 - Leonard: I'm telling you, you can't create love in a few hours. Right?\\
12 - Penny: Oh, careful. You're poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor.\\
13 - Sheldon: Yeah, but we don't have to debate this. We're scientists. We can conduct our own research. I propose that we imprison two street people and...\\
14 - Amy: No.\\
15 - Sheldon: You didn't even let me finish.\\
16 - Amy: Forget it.\\
17 - Sheldon: So, you can experiment on all the apes you want. But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings, suddenly I'm the monster.\\
18 - Raj: Why don't you just do the test?\\
19 - Sheldon: In the interest of science, I'd be willing to.\\
20 - Penny: What? You're okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?\\
21 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
22 - Penny: Please, can I do it with him? Please?\\
23 - Leonard: I've been listening to Sheldon's feelings on things for ten years. Tag, you're it.\\
24 - Raj: Yeah, but what if the experiment works?\\
25 - Penny: I'm not gonna fall in love with Sheldon.\\
26 - Amy: That's what I said. Before I knew it, he pontificated his way right into my heart.\\

44 - Penny: You know what? I can honestly say if we fall in love, not only will I drive you there, I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want.\\

49 - Raj: Well, even if the study's nonsense, I don't believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldn't use a Ouija board, or pick a fight with an Asian guy. He probably doesn't know karate, but why risk it?\\
50 - Amy: I think we're safe.\\
51 - Raj: Well, that's what the bullies at Bruce Lee's high school thought. And then, bam. Karate.\\

71 - first, I meant first.\\
72 - Clerk: I just need some information. Uh, what's the flight number?\\
73 - Bernadette: Eight sixteen.\\
74 - Howard: I really did mean first.\\
75 - Bernadette: Just drop it.\\
76 - Clerk: And can you describe the bag?\\
77 - Bernadette: Um, well, it's, uh, black. There's a red ribbon tied to the handle.\\
78 - Howard: The world's greatest mom is in the shoe compartment.\\
79 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
80 - Sheldon: You ready to begin?\\
81 - Penny: Yup. Be right there. I assume you don't want wine.\\
82 - Sheldon: Correct. You're not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.\\
83 - Penny: What heavy machinery? Let's just start.\\
84 - Sheldon: Well, as a Texas gentleman, I'm inclined to say ladies first. Although, I'm concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. Perhaps we should flip a coin. Or if you're familiar with the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors...\\
85 - Penny: Question one. "Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?"\\
86 - Sheldon: Hmm. Living or dead?\\
87 - Penny: Just says "anyone in the world". I guess that means living.\\
88 - Sheldon: Ah, that's just as well. As much as I'd love to meet Euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and I cannot look at toes during dinner. Oh, I know, the person I'd most like to have dinner with is myself.\\
89 - Penny: You sure that's your choice? 'Cause I've had that dinner.\\
90 - Sheldon: Well, I haven't. And while they say never meet your heroes, I just don't see how I could disappoint. Who would you choose?\\
91 - Penny: Robert Downey, Jr.\\
92 - Sheldon: Oh, I didn't think of Iron Man. You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner, we can meet you two for dessert.\\
93 - [ Raj's car ]\\
94 - Raj: So, what do you guys want to do?\\
95 - Amy: Well, we're the ones tagging along, you pick.\\
96 - Emily: Ooh, have you ever been to an escape room?\\
97 - Leonard: What's that?\\
98 - Emily: Um, it's kind of like interactive theatre, except you have to solve puzzles in a certain amount of time to get out. There's one downtown where they trap you in a room with a zombie.\\
99 - Raj: (short laugh) Oh, so kind of like what's happening with Penny right now.\\
100 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
101 - Sheldon: "What would constitute a perfect day for you?"\\
102 - Penny: Uh, well, I'd probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing.\\
103 - Sheldon: That's it?\\
104 - Penny: Yeah, why?\\
105 - Sheldon: You didn't mention Leonard.\\
106 - Penny: He's there.\\
107 - Sheldon: I don't think so. (stammers) Leonard can't stand yoga, the beach, massages or dancing.\\
108 - Penny: Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? What's yours?\\
109 - Sheldon: Uh, I wake up. Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup. Uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race.\\
110 - Penny: Interesting, you didn't mention Amy.\\
111 - Sheldon: Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?\\
112 - [ An escape room ]\\
113 - Woman in lab coat: You're about to enter the lab of the late Dr. David Saltzberg. While conducting studies on slowing the aging process, there was a catastrophic accident and he died. Or did he?\\
114 - Leonard: Ladies?\\
115 - Emily: Are you being polite or scared?\\
116 - Leonard: Yup.\\
117 - Emily: Ah, what a room!\\
118 - Amy: Oh.\\
119 - Leonard: This is cool.\\
120 - Amy: So, how do we start?\\
121 - Emily: We have to look for the clues hidden around the room.\\
122 - Raj: Uh, wasn't there supposed to be a zombie?\\
123 - Zombie: (growling) Uuuuuuuh!\\
124 - Raj: (yelling) Ooh! Okay, let's hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear.\\
125 - [ The Baggage Claim ]\\
126 - Clerk: Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz? As far as I can tell, your bag arrived in Los Angeles.\\
127 - Bernadette: So, where is it?\\
128 - Clerk: I don't know, perhaps somebody took it off the carousel by mistake?\\
129 - Howard: So, some stranger has my mom? Is that what you're telling me? My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?\\
130 - Clerk: I, I wish I was telling you that. Um, but the passenger could've gotten on an international flight.\\
131 - Howard: Oh, okay, great. So, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and you've narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet Earth.\\
132 - Clerk: I'm sorry. W, would 500 frequent-flyer miles help? That could get you to Sacramento.\\
133 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
134 - Sheldon: "If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?"\\
135 - Penny: Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.\\
136 - Sheldon: I don't think you're taking this seriously.\\
137 - Penny: Come on, I'm just having some fun with you.\\
138 - Sheldon: I believe what you're doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.\\
139 - Penny: Fine. Honestly, if I could have one quality, I wish I could be as smart as you guys.\\
140 - Sheldon: Ha. Keep dreaming.\\
141 - Penny: Sheldon.\\
142 - Shedon: I'm sorry. That was me having fun with you. Look, you may not be as, as academically inclined as are we. Yes, that's how you say it. But, you possess an intelligence I envy. Which leads me to my answer. I would choose the ability to read people's minds.\\
143 - Penny: Well, I can't read people's minds. Actually, that's not true, I can read men's minds, but only 'cause it's usually the one thing.\\
144 - Sheldon: When are we going to get robot eyes?\\
145 - Penny: You're all alike.\\
146 - Sheldon: Well, what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like, I can't always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know, like, uh, if they're mad at something I've done or just in a bad mood. It, it's incredibly stressful.\\
147 - Penny: Really? You always seem so confident.\\
148 - Sheldon: Well, I'm not. And if I could read people's minds, life would be so much simpler.\\
149 - Penny: Well, now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you.\\
150 - Sheldon: Thank you.\\
151 - Penny: Wow, I just felt this wave of affection for you.\\
152 - Sheldon: You sure it's not too much Bible juice?\\
153 - Penny: And the wave is gone.\\
154 - [ The escape room ]\\
155 - Zombie: Brains!\\
156 - Amy: Keep it down, we're working here.\\
157 - Raj: Okay, we've got the cipher decoded.\\
158 - Emily: How's it going with the globe?\\
159 - Amy: We used the coordinates to locate the cities.\\
160 - Leonard: I'm putting the city names in the grid now. I'm sure that'll give us the code to the safe.\\
161 - Zombie: Solve puzzle too fast! Slow down!\\
162 - Leonard: Yup. Got the code.\\
163 - Zombie: Just saying, no refund for finish early!\\
164 - [ The baggage check ]\\
165 - Bernadette: Sure you don't want to go home? When the bag's returned, they'll deliver it to us.\\
166 - Howard: No, I'm not leaving without her.\\
167 - Bernadette: All right, we'll wait.\\
168 - Howard: I could've driven her.\\
169 - Bernadette: What?\\
170 - Howard: The day she left for Florida. She asked me to drive her to the airport. I was too busy. And I made her take a cab. I was too busy.\\
171 - Bernadette: There's no way you could've known. Be right back. Excuse me?\\
172 - Clerk: Yes?\\
173 - Bernadette: You better find my husband's mother 'cause one way or another, w e're walking out of this airport with a dead woman.\\
174 - [ The escape room ]\\
175 - Leonard: Which book are we looking for?\\
176 - Raj: Uh, Origin of Species.\\
177 - Leonard: Here it is. There's a black light.\\
178 - Emily: Oh, hang on.\\
179 - (zombie moaning)\\
180 - Raj: Oh, okay. Uh, "Brothers and sisters I have none, but this man's father is my father's son. Who am I looking at?" Yeah, yeah, we get it, you want brains. Calm down.\\
181 - Amy: Well, if I don't have a brother, my father's son is me. And if I'm this man's father, then he's my son. The answer's "son".\\
182 - Emily: Ooh. There's a picture of the sun over there.\\
183 - Leonard: I bet the key's behind it.\\
184 - Zombie: Could be somewhere else.\\
185 - Emily: Oh, got the key.\\
186 - Amy: So, that's the key to the door? That's it?\\
187 - Leonard: We spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?\\
188 - Raj: It's like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just flew away.\\
189 - Emily: Sorry, guys. Really thought the puzzles would be better.\\
190 - Amy: Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees.\\
191 - Zombie: Remember that before you post on Yelp.\\
192 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
193 - Penny: "If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?"\\
194 - Sheldon: So, it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose there's something satisfying about dying on my birthday.\\
195 - Penny: Today's your birthday?\\
196 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
197 - Penny: Well, that's always been a secret. Not even Amy knows.\\
198 - Sheldon: Well, I don't enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling "surprise" fills me with more dread than the words "George Lucas Director's Cut."\\
199 - Penny: So, why did you finally tell me?\\
200 - Sheldon: The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.\\
201 - Penny: Well, thank you for sharing it with me. I won't tell anyone.\\
202 - Sheldon: Thank you.\\
203 - Penny: That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.\\
204 - Sheldon: You're making it difficult to love you right now.\\
205 - [ The baggage check ]\\
206 - Clerk: Great news, your bag was returned.\\
207 - Howard: Oh, thank God. It's okay, she's here. Ma's here.\\
208 - Bernadette: Okay, thank you so much.\\
209 - Howard: Ma? I'm sorry I didn't take you to the airport. I just want you to know that I'll never forgive myself for being so selfish. And I promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.\\
210 - Bernadette: Oh, no. That thing's gonna end up in my bedroom.\\
211 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
212 - Sheldon: That's it. We're done with the questions.\\
213 - Penny: All that's left to do is stare into each other's eyes for four minutes without talking.\\
214 - Sheldon: Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. We're good to go.\\
215 - Penny: You ready?\\
216 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
217 - Penny: And begin. This is kind of creepy.\\
218 - Sheldon: We're not supposed to talk during this part.\\
219 - Penny: Sorry.\\
220 - Sheldon: This is kind of creepy.\\
221 - Penny: Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact.\\
222 - Sheldon: Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car. So I'm just concentrating on that. Plus, it's easier around people that I'm comfortable with.\\
223 - Penny: Aw, sweetie, I'm comfortable around you, too.\\
224 - Sheldon: Of course you are, I'm warm and soothing. I'm like a human bowl of tomato soup.\\
225 - Penny: I meant more like a little brother.\\
226 - Sheldon: Oh. Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister. And sometimes, a mother.\\
227 - Penny: It's getting creepy again.\\
228 - Sheldon: What?\\
229 - Penny: Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.\\
230 - Sheldon: It was a Monday afternoon. You joined us for Indian food.\\
231 - Penny: Can you believe it's been eight years?\\
232 - Sheldon: Yeah, and you're still eating our food.\\
233 - Penny: I can't remember a time you guys weren't in my life.\\
234 - Sheldon: I remember it perfectly. But I have an eidetic memory. If you're interested, I also remember how much you owe us for the food.\\
235 - (alarm beeping)\\
236 - Penny: That's it. That wasn't so bad.\\
237 - Sheldon: No, it wasn't. Uh, now let's tabulate the results of the experiment. I think it's safe to say that you're not in love with me and I'm not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences.\\
238 - Penny: Well, maybe. But I'm still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you.\\
239 - Sheldon: And I, you. And yes, that's how you say that. Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, I'd say we have some hard choices to make.\\
240 - Penny: Like what?\\
241 - Sheldon: Gary Con, do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so, who gets to be Gary?\\
242 - [ The hallway ]\\
243 - Sheldon: Thank you for walking me home.\\
244 - Penny: I just want to make sure you get there safe.\\
245 - Sheldon: Well, this is me. It's been a very interesting evening.\\
246 - Penny: It really has.\\
247 - All: Surprise!\\
248 - Sheldon: Aah! And after I let you be Gary.

2 - Leonard: I was unstoppable. I mean, I was, I was on fire. It was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when they're in the zone.\\
3 - Penny: Again, it was miniature golf.\\
4 - Leonard: Admit it, you're a little turned on.\\
5 - Penny: You can't be this proud.\\
6 - Leonard: Why not?\\
7 - Penny: Because I beat you.\\
8 - Leonard: Hey.\\
9 - Penny: Hi.\\
10 - Sheldon: Oh, good. You're back.\\
11 - Amy: We have some exciting news.\\
12 - Leonard: Okay.\\
13 - Sheldon: As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time, and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible.\\
14 - Penny: Okay.\\
15 - Amy: After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward.\\
16 - Leonard: Okay.\\
17 - Sheldon: Do you want to say it?\\
18 - Amy: Let's say it together.\\
19 - Together: We're getting a turtle.\\
20 - Penny: This is why I've been saying we should keep champagne on ice.\\
21 - Sheldon: Sarcasm?\\
22 - Amy: Yes.\\
23 - Sheldon: Okay. That was tricky, 'cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business.\\
24 - Leonard: Well, we're, we're very happy for you.\\
25 - Penny: Yes.\\
26 - Amy: Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.\\
27 - Sheldon: No. It's true. It means that we care so much about each other, there's enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.\\
28 - Leonard: Why a turtle?\\
29 - Sheldon: After much deliberation, we've determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don't shed fur, they don't make noise.\\
30 - Amy: For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.\\
31 - Sheldon: Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that's also why I chose you as a roommate.\\
32 - Leonard: Well, congratulations. Who would've thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?\\
33 - Penny: Mm-hmm.\\
34 - Amy: That's what I said.\\
35 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\

48 - [ Emily's apartment ]\\
49 - Raj: So, where's your roommate tonight?\\
50 - Emily: Well, I thought it was a little unfair that she's always here, and you never get a chance to stay over, so I killed her.\\
51 - Raj: But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding.\\
52 - Emily: And the more important thing to remember is that I'd never hurt you. (phone chimes) Oh, crap. I have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient.\\
53 - Raj: That's okay. I can come back later.\\
54 - Emily: No. No, don't be silly. I won't be gone long. Just stay here.\\
55 - Raj: Okay, cool. Oh, and you're sure your roommate's not gonna come back while I'm here alone, right? 'Cause that'll be awkward.\\
56 - Emily: Oh, don't worry. She's in Palm Springs.\\
57 - Raj: Oh, good.\\
58 - Emily: Well, her torso is. Just kidding. I put her in a wood chipper.\\
59 - [ A pet store ]\\
60 - Sheldon: Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.\\
61 - Amy: It's okay. You made it. We're fine.\\
62 - Sheldon: That was a lot of puppies.\\
63 - Amy: Let's forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?\\
64 - Sheldon: Oh, I don't know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?\\
65 - Amy: Well, he's barely moving. He looks half dead.\\
66 - Sheldon: I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How'd you like to come home with us? You'll be living with me because we don't live in the same house.\\
67 - Amy: But that's not your fault. Like you, we're taking it ridiculously slow. You'll stay with me when he's at Comic-Con or away for work.\\
68 - Sheldon: Or if they accept Daddy's application to live on Mars.\\
69 - Amy: What are you talking about?\\
70 - Sheldon: Oh, there's this company that's attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking "Seth", but he kind of looks Italian.\\
71 - Amy: You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldn't be bothered to tell me?\\
72 - Sheldon: Would you have approved?\\
73 - Amy: Of course not.\\
74 - Sheldon: Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isn't that right, Giuseppe?\\
75 - [ The apartment ]\\
76 - Leonard: Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make.\\
77 - Penny: Aw, is this your first time?\\
78 - Leonard: No, I got you something for Valentine's Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.\\
79 - Penny: Well, why?\\
80 - Leonard: Well, 'cause I got it at the dirty store.\\
81 - Penny: You went to the dirty store without me?\\
82 - Leonard: In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.\\
83 - Penny: Well, get it. Get it for me.\\
84 - Leonard: Yeah?\\
85 - Penny: Yeah.\\
86 - Leonard: Okay, uh, well, I hope it's fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it's kind of creative and artistic.\\
87 - Penny: Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?\\
88 - Leonard: No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.\\
89 - Penny: Whoa, that's kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off.\\
90 - Leonard: You're making fun of me. Forget it.\\
91 - Penny: No. No, come on, I want to do it.\\
92 - Leonard: Really?\\
93 - Penny: Yeah, let's you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.\\
94 - Leonard: Okay, but it's a drive, the one I went to is in San Diego.\\
95 - [ Howard and Bernadette's apartment ]\\
96 - Howard: How are the taxes going?\\
97 - Bernadette: Okay. But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here.\\
98 - Howard: Those are business expenses. You can write those off.\\
99 - Bernadette: A two hundred dollar R2-D2 is a business expense?\\
100 - Howard: Oh, Bernie, you're gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited. (cell phone rings) Hey, what's up?\\
101 - Raj: Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital, so I'm just hanging out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?\\
102 - Howard: Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.\\
103 - Raj: What are you, a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?\\
104 - Howard: She doesn't have to, I filled up on jelly beans.\\
105 - Raj: So, uh, what game are you... Oh. Crap.\\
106 - Howard: What's wrong?\\
107 - Raj: I can't get Emily's night-stand to close.\\
108 - Howard: So?\\
109 - Raj: She's gonna know I was looking in it.\\
110 - Howard: Why were you looking in it?\\
111 - Raj: Well, there's a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back.\\
112 - Howard: Okay, calm down. There's probably something jammed behind it. Just, uh, pull it out and see what's there.\\
113 - Raj: Hang on. Oh no. Oh, no. Oh, God, no.\\
114 - Howard: You know what, you sound busy, I'm gonna let you go.\\
115 - Raj: Dude, the whole front came off. Now she's gonna know I was snooping.\\
116 - Bernadette: What's happening?\\
117 - Howard: Raj was snooping through Emily's drawers and broke one.\\
118 - Bernadette: Aw. I'm gonna miss her.\\
119 - [ Penny's bedroom ]\\
120 - Penny: So what do you think?\\
121 - Leonard: I thought it'd be a little more, just more.\\
122 - Penny: I'm not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean, did we move at all?\\
123 - Leonard: Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad.\\
124 - Penny: Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this.\\
125 - Leonard: Uh, Th, that's true. How late did we stay up last night?\\
126 - Penny: Almost 1am.\\
127 - Leonard: Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren't even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.\\
128 - Penny: Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this.\\
129 - Leonard: Yeah. You get the paint, I'll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this.\\
130 - [ The stairwell ]\\
131 - Sheldon: I can't believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.\\
132 - Amy: No one told you to poke the turtle's face.\\
133 - Sheldon: I was playing Got Your Nose. That's how you get children to like you.\\
134 - Amy: I'm surprised you even care if he likes you, since you're planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.\\
135 - Sheldon: Ugh, this again. Amy, I've already had one new hole torn in my body today. I don't need another one.\\
136 - Amy: Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever.\\
137 - Sheldon: So you're saying you wouldn't leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?\\
138 - Amy: I would at least mention it before filling out the application.\\
139 - Sheldon: Huh, that's exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said.\\
140 - Amy: And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.\\
141 - Sheldon: First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application.\\
142 - Amy: You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon.\\
143 - Sheldon: Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?\\
144 - Amy: No. Forget it.\\
145 - Sheldon: What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?\\
146 - Amy: Please don't.\\
147 - (humming the Star Trek theme)\\
148 - Sheldon: Yep, you're mad.\\
149 - [ Howard and Bernadette's apartment. Howard is on the phone to Raj ]\\
150 - Howard: Okay, let me see the damage.\\
151 - Raj: Hang on.\\
152 - Howard: Well, I think you broke the dowels. You're not gonna have time to glue it back on, you'll have to nail it.\\
153 - Raj: With what?\\
154 - Howard: Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?\\
155 - Raj: She does.\\
156 - Howard: Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.\\
157 - Raj: Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?\\
158 - [ The apartment ]\\
159 - Sheldon: I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint.\\
160 - Amy: Why do you even want to do this?\\
161 - Sheldon: Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?\\
162 - Amy: Can't you just tell me?\\
163 - Sheldon: But I made a video.\\
164 - Sheldon (on video): I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I'd like to tell you why I should be chosen to (echoing) go to Mars. I'm exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can't take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don't trust me because I smell like nothing. Yeah... (inhales) Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?\\
165 - Leonard (on video): You mean this weirdly suspicious one?\\
166 - Sheldon (on video): Yes. Open it and check.\\
167 - Leonard (on video): I don't get it. There's actually peanut brittle in... Please go to Mars.\\
168 - Sheldon (on video): But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it's my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. (echoing) To Mars.\\
169 - Sheldon: Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out.\\
170 - [ Penny's bathroom ]\\
171 - Leonard: Right there, right there, Oh, God, that's it.\\
172 - Penny: How did you get paint in your eye?\\
173 - Leonard: Because you wouldn't let me wear safety goggles.\\
174 - [ Emily's bedroom. Raj is still on the phone with Howard ]\\
175 - Raj: (sighs heavily) This looks terrible. She, she's gonna know.\\
176 - Howard: It's fine. You just need two more nails.\\
177 - Raj: Okay, where should I put them?\\
178 - Howard: In Emily's eyes.\\
179 - Raj: You're not helping.\\
180 - Bernadette: Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping.\\
181 - Raj: You know, it, it's bad enough that I have to deal with this...\\
182 - Emily: Raj? I'm back.\\
183 - (door closes)\\
184 - Raj: Oh, no. Hey.\\
185 - Emily: Hi.\\
186 - Raj: (stammering) How was the hospital?\\
187 - Emily: Fine. What were you doing in there?\\
188 - Raj: Uh w, well, okay, look, I, I don't want to lie to you. I got curious, I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand.\\
189 - Emily: You were looking in my night stand?\\
190 - Raj: Yeah.\\
191 - Emily: So, the first time I leave you alone, you snoop on me?\\
192 - Raj: You've never snooped around my apartment?\\
193 - Emily: No.\\
194 - Raj: Come on, think back. It would really help if you had.\\
195 - Emily: I can't believe you don't trust me.\\
196 - Bernadette: She sounds really mad.\\
197 - Howard: We should hang up.\\
198 - Bernadette: Yeah, we should.\\
199 - Howard: But we're not going to, are we?\\
200 - Bernadette: Not a chance.\\
201 - Howard: What happened to snooping is wrong?\\
202 - Bernadette: Howard, you're going to jail for tax fraud. Who cares?\\
203 - [ Penny's bedroom ]\\
204 - Leonard: Well, we did it.\\
205 - Penny: We sure did.\\
206 - Leonard: I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete.\\
207 - Penny: Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.\\
208 - Leonard: So, where do we want to hang it?\\
209 - Penny: What? Are you kidding? We're not hanging it.\\
210 - Leonard: But it's an expression of our love.\\
211 - Penny: And our butts. Not hanging it.\\
212 - Leonard: Seems a shame to throw it away.\\
213 - Penny: Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William Shatner painted it.\\
214 - Leonard: God, I love you. I love you so much.\\
215 - [ The apartment ]\\
216 - Amy: I think I'm gonna go home.\\
217 - Sheldon: Why? I really don't understand what's happening here.\\
218 - Amy: You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something.\\
219 - Sheldon: Amy. Oh, why didn't I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.\\
220 - Amy: Sure. Unless something better comes along.\\
221 - Sheldon: Do you want me to withdraw my application?\\
222 - Amy: What I want is for us to be planning our future together.\\
223 - Sheldon: And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because I've seen people make the long-distance thing work.\\
224 - Amy: We're on the same planet.\\
225 - Sheldon: Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?\\
226 - Amy: Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?\\
227 - Sheldon: I am. Yeah, if I'm going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don't we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?\\
228 - Amy: Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.\\
229 - Sheldon: Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say "good lord, what on Mars are you talking about"?\\
230 - Amy: You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars.\\
231 - Sheldon: You just can't keep it in your space pants, can you?\\
232 - Amy: Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians.\\
233 - Sheldon: They would, wouldn't they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?\\
234 - Amy: I guess we'll have to make a new video together, as a couple.\\
235 - Sheldon: (gasps) Good idea. And since you've had such a rough day, I'm gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard's face.\\
236 - [ Emily's bedroom ]\\
237 - Raj: Thank you for forgiving me.\\
238 - Emily: That's okay. At some point, we were bound to have our first fight.\\
239 - Raj: Well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust "doughy", but the truth is you were right, and I was just angry at myself.\\
240 - Emily: Can I ask you one thing?\\
241 - Raj: Of course. What?\\
242 - Emily: Did you look in my closet?\\
243 - Raj: No. Just the drawer.\\
244 - Emily: You promise you didn't look in the closet?\\
245 - Raj: I promise. Why, what's in there?\\
246 - Emily: Don't worry about it. Good night.

2 - Sheldon: Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places.\\
3 - Amy: I'd say I'm sorry I asked, except I didn't.\\
4 - Sheldon: Oh, look, it's the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.\\
5 - Amy: Oh, let me see.\\
6 - Sheldon: I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks.\\
7 - Amy: Sheldon, this article doesn't mention Leonard at all.\\
8 - Sheldon: Well, that can't be right.\\
9 - Amy: It only refers to "Dr. Cooper and his team." Did you even talk about him?\\
10 - Sheldon: All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesn't include any of those smelly perfume cards.\\
11 - Amy: Poor Leonard.\\
12 - Sheldon: Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.\\
13 - Amy: He might not be.\\
14 - Sheldon: Oh, maybe you're right. He is kind of a lump.\\
15 - Amy: Think about it. How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonard's team?\\
16 - Sheldon: Oh, I'd be incensed.\\
17 - Amy: So you see what I'm getting at?\\
18 - Sheldon: Squeaky wheel gets the grease?\\
19 - Amy: No.\\
20 - Sheldon: Grass is always greener?\\
21 - Amy: Try again.\\
22 - Sheldon: Well, I don't know, we're all Groot? Just tell me.\\
23 - Amy: Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. He's going to feel bad.\\
24 - Sheldon: But it wasn't my fault. I didn't exclude him. And I didn't write the article.\\
25 - Amy: Remember that time you didn't get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?\\
26 - Sheldon: Oh, that kid. Poor Leonard.\\
27 - Amy: Exactly.\\
28 - Sheldon: For the record, that kid was a terrible choice. If you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule England.\\
29 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
30 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
31 -  The Earth began to cool \\
32 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\

42 - [ Howard's car ]\\
43 - Howard: Thanks for helping us sort through all my mom's stuff.\\
44 - Raj: Of course. I know what it's like having to go through a loved one's possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died, you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay? But in India, it's a thing.\\
45 - Bernadette: Well, it'll be good that you're there. Howard's been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go.\\
46 - Howard: Well, it's hard. A lot of Ma's stuff brings back fond memories.\\
47 - Bernadette: Is that why you couldn't get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?\\
48 - Howard: Yes. It reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick, nobody's looking, fill your pockets with ketchup.\\
49 - [ The apartment ]\\
50 - Sheldon: Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?\\
51 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
52 - Sheldon: Good, good. And your name is on the electric bill and mine isn't. And I'm okay with that.\\
53 - Leonard: Actually, your name is on the electric bill.\\
54 - Sheldon: Oh, right. This is a disaster.\\
55 - Leonard: I don't even know what you're talking about and I agree.\\
56 - Sheldon: Okay, I have to tell you something, but you're not going to like it.\\
57 - Leonard: What's going on?\\
58 - Sheldon: An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory.\\
59 - Leonard: Did they hate it?\\
60 - Sheldon: No. No, they loved it. They, uh, couldn't say enough nice things about it.\\
61 - Leonard: So what's the problem?\\
62 - Sheldon: You know how the PennySaver only has my name...\\
63 - Leonard: Sheldon.\\
64 - Sheldon: They didn't mention you in the article. Only me.\\
65 - Leonard: Really?\\
66 - Sheldon: I know. It's not fair. Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and a**l sphincter. Let's keep those tight.\\
67 - Leonard: Uh, that, that's not necessary.\\
68 - Sheldon: It is. They're what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look, maybe, maybe you shouldn't read it. It'll only make you feel worse.\\
69 - Leonard: "Cooper and his team"?\\
70 - Sheldon: You should know I had nothing to do with that.\\
71 - Leonard: Uh, at least they're talking about the theory. I mean, that's what's important.\\
72 - Sheldon: You know, you're right. Yeah. You know, it's like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and he's far richer. And he's a household name, you know? Whereas, you know, you say Ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.\\
73 - Leonard: That's not helping.\\
74 - Sheldon: Well, I'd give more examples, but, well, everyone in your position's so forgettable.\\
75 - [ Mrs Wolowitz's House ]\\
76 - Howard: Stuart, we're here.\\
77 - Raj: It's nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom's house.\\
78 - Howard: Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb, but nobody took him.\\
79 - Stuart: Hey. Just so you know, the power's out.\\
80 - Bernadette: What happened?\\
81 - Stuart: I called, they said a transformer blew. It's the whole block. Should be fixed by tomorrow.\\
82 - Howard: Wait, when did it go out?\\
83 - Stuart: In the middle of the night.\\
84 - Howard: Oh, my God.\\
85 - Bernadette: Howie, what's wrong?\\
86 - Howard: It's all defrosting.\\
87 - Bernadette: It's okay. It's just food.\\
88 - Howard: It's not just food. This is the last food my mother ever made. This is her last brisket. This is her last meatloaf. This is her last. I have no idea what this is, but it's the last one.\\
89 - Raj: Everything okay?\\
90 - Howard: No. All Ma's food is gonna be ruined.\\
91 - Bernadette: Well, why don't we take it home and put it in our freezer?\\
92 - Raj: You don't want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.\\
93 - Bernadette: What should we do?\\
94 - Howard: I'll tell you exactly what we're gonna do. We're gonna eat it.\\
95 - Bernadette: There's, like, twenty pounds of food in there.\\
96 - Howard: All you said was I had to get rid of things. You didn't say they couldn't pass through my colon first.\\
97 - Bernadette: Howie.\\
98 - Howard: Okay. Then how about this? Let's invite everyone over to dinner. It'll be like Ma's feeding us one last time.\\
99 - Bernadette: I love that.\\
100 - Raj: Me, too. Oh, look, we've got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it.\\
101 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
102 - Penny: I mean, who even reads Scientific American?\\
103 - Leonard: It's kind of a big deal.\\
104 - Penny: If it's such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?\\
105 - Leonard: Can we please just stop talking about it?\\
106 - Penny: I'm sorry. What can I do?\\
107 - Leonard: Nothing, I'm fine.\\
108 - Penny: No, no. I'm gonna cheer you up. Here we go.\\
109 - Leonard: What are we doing?\\
110 - Penny: I am taking you shopping.\\
111 - Leonard: Oh.\\
112 - Penny: My baby is sad, and I'm gonna make him happy again.\\
113 - Leonard: Look, I know shopping cheers you up, but it's just not really my thing.\\
114 - Penny: Well, what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?\\
115 - Leonard: Does it have a camera in it?\\
116 - Penny: It does have a camera in it.\\
117 - Leonard: Baby's listening.\\
118 - Sheldon: (Knocks) Leonard? (Knocks) Leonard? (Knocks) Leonard?\\
119 - Leonard: What?\\
120 - Sheldon: I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.\\
121 - Leonard: What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?\\
122 - Sheldon: I did.\\
123 - Leonard: Thank you. What did he say?\\
124 - Sheldon: He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.\\
125 - Leonard: Why did he think you're the lead scientist? It was my idea.\\
126 - Penny: You know, for an extra four bucks, I can have this thing here tomorrow.\\
127 - Sheldon: Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said he's been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is 'cause my name is on it.\\
128 - Penny: You know what? I did it. What's four bucks?\\
129 - Leonard: If you're trying to make me feel better, it's not working.\\
130 - Sheldon: Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?\\
131 - Leonard: No.\\
132 - Sheldon: Oh. That's just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up. (Knocks) Leonard? (Knocks) Leonard? (Knocks) Leonard? Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so I'm ready whenever you are.\\
133 - [ Amy's car ]\\
134 - Sheldon: All he had was an idea.\\
135 - Amy: Well, that is an important part.\\
136 - Sheldon: Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won't Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.\\
137 - Amy: But Leonard's idea was good.\\
138 - Sheldon: Fine. Then Grumpy, what's he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won't take his side.\\
139 - [ Penny's car ]\\
140 - Leonard: I'm the one who thought of it.\\
141 - Penny: Well, didn't he do a lot of the work?\\
142 - Leonard: Yeah. But now he's happy to let people think he's responsible for everything.\\
143 - Penny: And that's why you get an iPad helicopter.\\
144 - [ Amy's car ]\\
145 - Sheldon: Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?\\
146 - Amy: It's not your fault.\\
147 - Sheldon: Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?\\
148 - Amy: Not your fault.\\
149 - Sheldon: Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn't correct him?\\
150 - Amy: Hey, look at that pretty bird.\\
151 - [ Penny's car ]\\
152 - Leonard: He always needs all the attention. He's such a baby.\\
153 - Penny: I know, I know.\\
154 - Leonard: I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.\\
155 - [ Mrs Wolowitz's kitchen ]\\
156 - Raj: Okay, I'll start heating some of this stuff up.\\
157 - Bernadette: Thanks.\\
158 - Howard: Oh, man. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom. A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.\\
159 - Bernadette: Did she throw anything away?\\
160 - Howard: No. If I find my foreskin, I'm gonna kill myself.\\
161 - Raj: Okay, so we've got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna.\\
162 - Howard: No, that's noodle kugel.\\
163 - Raj: One Jewish lasagna, two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzoh ball soup.\\
164 - Howard: Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking.\\
165 - Bernadette: You okay?\\
166 - Howard: Yeah, I'm okay. Let's get started.\\
167 - Raj: You got it.\\
168 - Howard: (voice breaking) I'm never gonna talk to her again.\\
169 - Bernadette: Should we tell everyone not to come?\\
170 - Howard: No. I want to do this.\\
171 - Bernadette: Okay. Well, I'll keep it together if you can.\\
172 - Howard: Okay. (chuckles)\\
173 - Raj: (voice breaking) I'm not making any promises.\\
174 - [ Mrs Wolowitz's living room ]\\
175 - Stuart: Glad you guys could make it.\\
176 - Leonard: Of course.\\
177 - Penny: Wow, it looks really pretty in here.\\
178 - Stuart: Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood.\\
179 - Leonard: So, Stuart, have you thought about what you'd do if Howard sells the house?\\
180 - Stuart: And there goes the mood.\\
181 - Sheldon: Hi. Hello. Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name.\\
182 - Leonard: Subtle.\\
183 - Sheldon: But you got it, right?\\
184 - Howard: Hey, guys.\\
185 - All: Hey. Hi. Hello.\\
186 - Howard: I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight's not a sad occasion.\\
187 - Bernadette: Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we've all had here so many times before.\\
188 - Howard: Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death.\\
189 - Amy: Do you need any help in the kitchen?\\
190 - Bernadette: No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable.\\
191 - Penny: All right, hey, you two, we're here for Howard right now, okay?\\
192 - Amy: Yes, so please behave yourselves.\\
193 - Leonard: Fine.\\
194 - Sheldon: Of course.\\
195 - Stuart: So I heard you two, uh, wrote a paper together. How's that going?\\
196 - [ Mrs Wolowitz's dining room ]\\
197 - Penny: This food is amazing.\\
198 - Raj: Mm, and not a vegetable in sight.\\
199 - Howard: That's not true. We've got tomatoes right here.\\
200 - Amy: All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.\\
201 - Sheldon: Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.\\
202 - Penny: Oh, so it's like The View.\\
203 - Amy: Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women.\\
204 - Sheldon: Oh, I'm aware. It features Whoopi Goldberg. She played Guinan on Star Trek: Next Gen. Penny, Next Gen refers to Star Trek...\\
205 - Penny: Shut up.\\
206 - Raj: I would like to propose a salon topic.\\
207 - Amy: Ooh, please do, Rajesh.\\
208 - Raj: The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made "Tor" a female.\\
209 - Penny: Wait, who's Tor?\\
210 - Raj: You know, Tor, the God of "Tunder". As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?\\
211 - Howard: Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.\\
212 - Stuart: It's true. At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet.\\
213 - Amy: We won't know if there's equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.\\
214 - Howard: I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.\\
215 - Penny: Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.\\
216 - Sheldon: I don't believe it matters what the topic is. What's crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It's all about the execution.\\
217 - Leonard: Of course you'd focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What's more important, an idea or its execution?\\
218 - Bernadette: Oh, that's fine.\\
219 - Sheldon: Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That's a lovely little notion. Kind of like, "I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago." Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. "Hello? Oh, hold on." Leonard, it's your uncle. He says you just got burned.\\
220 - Amy: Sheldon.\\
221 - Penny: Guys.\\
222 - Leonard: No, it's okay. We're all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?\\
223 - Howard: Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real.\\
224 - Sheldon: Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. Starting today, it'll go Gettysburg Address, "I have a dream," and what he just said.\\
225 - Leonard: Oh, now he's a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.\\
226 - Sheldon: Leonard, please. His mother just died.\\
227 - Leonard: You're being ridiculous.\\
228 - Sheldon: Yeah, so are you.\\
229 - Penny: Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I'd go to my real salon.\\
230 - Sheldon: Leonard, lots of people could've had that idea, but very few people could've worked out the math the way I did.\\
231 - Leonard: Lots of people also didn't have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me.\\
232 - Sheldon: Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he's better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don't know about you, but I support our boys overseas.\\
233 - Amy: And girls.\\
234 - Sheldon: Hey, you already ruined Thor; give it a rest.\\
235 - Leonard: So I'm just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?\\
236 - Sheldon: I didn't hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.\\
237 - Leonard: You want some of this? I'll give you some.\\
238 - Bernadette: Hey. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!\\
239 - Sheldon: She said my name first, that must kill you.\\
240 - Bernadette (O.C.): I don't know what you think you're doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband. We're eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? Whatever it is you're fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there's no dessert for either of you. Look at me when I'm talking to you. And don't think...\\
241 - Howard: You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom?\\
242 - Amy: I don't hear it.\\
243 - Raj: No, not at all.\\
244 - [ Mrs Wolowitz's living room ]\\
245 - Penny: I don't think I've eaten that much in my entire life.\\
246 - Howard: It's why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off.\\
247 - Sheldon: You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert...\\
248 - Penny: Shut up.\\
249 - Ra: So glad you two are done fighting.\\
250 - Leonard: Right now, I'm just trying to burp without throwing up.\\
251 - Sheldon: Hang on. Physics Today mentioned the paper.\\
252 - Stuart: What'd they say?\\
253 - Amy: Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?\\
254 - Sheldon: They did.\\
255 - All: Yay.\\
256 - Bernadette: Good news, I found more Tums.\\
257 - All: Yay.

2 - Sheldon: Leonard, I've been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley.\\
3 - Leonard: Oh, I like to laugh. But say it anyway.\\
4 - Sheldon: Okay, um, what do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department? I'll have fries with that. Because his education hasn't prepared him for a career in the sciences.\\
5 - Penny: You know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon.\\
6 - Amy: Are you all set for your trip?\\
7 - Sheldon: Yeah, I think so. I just restocked the old PRK.\\
8 - Penny: "PRK"?\\
9 - Leonard: Public restroom kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places.\\
10 - Sheldon: I don't see what's crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell.\\
11 - Leonard: Keep going.\\
12 - Sheldon: And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener. Um, noise-cancelling headphones. Oh, danger whistle. Um, pepper spray. Ooh, a multi-language occupied sign. Uh, let's see, we have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes, a clothespin for my nose. Oh, and a mirror on a stick, so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn't some kind of weirdo.\\
13 - Penny: You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away?\\
14 - Amy: Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle?\\

28 - [ Leonard's car ]\\
29 - Sheldon: Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called "I Can't Spy"? It's all the nail-biting tension of I Spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum.\\
30 - Leonard: If it's half as much fun as "One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall," I'm in.\\
31 - Sheldon: I'll begin. Uh, I can't spy with my little eye something passing right through us.\\
32 - Leonard: That soy Frappuccino I had.\\
33 - Sheldon: Will you please play the game? I can't spy with my little eye something passing right through us.\\
34 - Leonard: I don't know, um, if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimetres, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?\\
35 - Sheldon: I don't want to play anymore.\\
36 - Leonard: We haven't been on a road trip in a while. This is fun.\\
37 - Sheldon: We get it, you won the game. Stop bragging.\\
38 - Leonard: No, listen, we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? That's pretty cool.\\
39 - Sheldon: I suppose it is. In fact, if you'd like to celebrate with a little music, I'd be okay with that.\\
40 - Leonard: What? This road trip just got crazy.\\
41 - Sheldon: Play that funky music, white boy.\\
42 - Leonard: I'm surprised you know that reference.\\
43 - Sheldon: What reference?\\
44 - [ Mrs Wolowitz's house ]\\
45 - Bernadette: So, I put stickers on everything we're gonna sell. We just need help taking it all out to the driveway.\\
46 - Amy: Can I be in charge of pricing? I've been going to garage sales my whole life. Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel?\\
47 - Howard: All right, Amy's in charge of pricing and being 75.\\
48 - Raj: Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this?\\
49 - Penny: Sure. Oh, we had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time.\\
50 - Raj: Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong.\\
51 - Penny: Oh, I meant beer pong.\\
52 - Amy: I had a table, too, but I didn't have any friends, so all I did was serve.\\
53 - Bernadette: You know, you can leave one side up and play against it.\\
54 - Amy: And if I had a friend, they might have told me that.\\
55 - Howard: Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It's my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house.\\
56 - Bernadette: I think you just answered your own question.\\
57 - Howard: Come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it.\\
58 - Bernadette: Sweetie, we have a lot to do. We don't need to decide this right now.\\
59 - Howard: Well, I guess as long as you're keeping an open mind.\\
60 - Bernadette: Of course.\\
61 - [ Leonard's car ]\\
62 -  "Play that funky music, white boy" is playing \\
63 - Sheldon: So they're requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?\\
64 - Leonard: Yes.\\
65 - Sheldon: And this music we're listening to right now is funky as well?\\
66 - Leonard: Sure.\\
67 - Sheldon: Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?\\
68 - Leonard: It could be.\\
69 - Sheldon: So it's like the musical equivalent of Russell's Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don't contain themselves as members contains itself?\\
70 - Leonard: Exactly.\\
71 - Sheldon: Well then I hate it. Music should just be fun.\\
72 - (music stops)\\
73 - Leonard: Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early.\\
74 - Sheldon: Will our hotel room be ready?\\
75 - Leonard: I doubt it.\\
76 - Sheldon: Aren't you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?\\
77 - Leonard: If we do, we'll just tell him to hit the bricks, see?\\
78 - Sheldon: Seems a little confrontational, but all right. You know, we won't be very far from Skywalker Ranch.\\
79 - Leonard: Oh, that's true. It's not like we can get in there.\\
80 - Sheldon: Why not?\\
81 - Leonard: I-I don't think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.\\
82 - Sheldon: Yoda's swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. That's code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in.\\
83 - Leonard: We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it.\\
84 - Sheldon: Yes. Oh, I'm so excited. And I just can't hide it.\\
85 - Leonard: "I'm about to lose control, and I think I like it."\\
86 - Sheldon: What are you talking about?\\
87 - [ Mrs Wolowitz's house ]\\
88 - Penny: So when do you guys think you're gonna move in?\\
89 - Howard: We're still figuring how much remodeling we want to do.\\
90 - Bernadette: It's tricky finding the right balance between "tasteful modern" and "Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest."\\
91 - Amy: Have you made a decision about the TARDIS? I think I can sell it if we call it "Big British Porta-Potty."\\
92 - Howard: We're not selling it, it's mine.\\
93 - Bernadette: You can't just decide. How about I arm-wrestle you?\\
94 - Howard: That's not fair. It's like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.\\
95 - Raj: You could play Ping-Pong for it.\\
96 - Howard: I would do that.\\
97 - Bernadette: How is that fair? You grew up with a table.\\
98 - Howard: Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods.\\
99 - Penny: Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through, I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where I hate that I know it belongs.\\
100 - Bernadette: Yes, Penny plays for me.\\
101 - Howard: That's not fair, she has upper body muscles.\\
102 - Raj: Dude, three-time Sanskriti School for Well-Born Boys badminton champion.\\
103 - Howard: That's right, okay, Raj can play for me.\\
104 - Amy: Ooh, you just chose champions. It's like we're re-enacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat.\\
105 - Penny: Yeah, it's also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones.\\
106 - Bernadette: Leonard makes you watch that, too?\\
107 - Penny: No, no, I like that show. It's got dragons and people doing it.\\
108 - Howard: So it's settled. The fate of Doctor Who's TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers.\\
109 - Amy: If you still have that bra, I'll give you a nickel for it.\\
110 - [ Leonard's car ]\\
111 - Sheldon: There it is. It's just a gate. On a road.\\
112 - Leonard: Wasn't even that hard to find.\\
113 - Sheldon: This is so amazing.\\
114 - Leonard: I know. You want to get a picture?\\
115 - Sheldon: I want more than a picture. I want to go in.\\
116 - Leonard: Well, so do I, but they'll never let us.\\
117 - Sheldon: Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?\\
118 - Leonard: No, but I don't have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me.\\
119 - Sheldon: There's a speaker box. Drive up, push the button, and let's see what happens.\\
120 - Leonard: Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? I'm a little nervous.\\
121 - Sheldon: Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations.\\
122 - Leonard: Right.\\
123 - Sheldon: (gasps) You pushed it, are you out of your mind?\\
124 - Voice: May I help you?\\
125 - Leonard: Um, uh, uh, uh, we don't have an appointment, and, and we don't belong here, but we, we're, like, crazy-big fans. I mean... (stammers) uh, buh, buh, "crazy for Star Wars" crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don't want to look in.\\
126 - Sheldon: You're blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him.\\
127 - Voice: Hello? This speaker's not working, just pull up.\\
128 - Leonard: And that's how it's done.\\
129 - [ The same, further inside the ranch ]\\
130 - Sheldon: All right, we've defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate.\\
131 - Leonard: We're trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda.\\
132 - Sheldon: I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So what's the plan?\\
133 - Leonard: Uh, I'm just gonna be honest with the guy.\\
134 - Sheldon: Honesty will never get us in.\\
135 - Leonard: Well, what's your plan?\\
136 - Sheldon: All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse's office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.\\
137 - Security Guard: Who are you here to see?\\
138 - Leonard: Uh, I'm just gonna tell you the truth.\\
139 - Sheldon: Oh, you are killing me.\\
140 - Leonard: We don't have an appointment. We, we're just fans of Mr. Lucas's work, and we thought we'd take a shot and see if we could get in and look around.\\
141 - Security Guard: Sorry, guys, we get this a lot. Can't let you in.\\
142 - Sheldon: What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? (imitating Yoda) A recording session I must attend.\\
143 - Leonard: I'm sorry, don't listen to him. We're actually physicists. We're giving a lecture at Berkeley later today. We just, we had some time to kill.\\
144 - Security Guard: Hey, listen, you seem like decent guys. I can't let you in, but I got some hats and T-shirts I can give you.\\
145 - Leonard: Thank you so much. See? Maybe honesty is the best... (door opens) What are you doing?\\
146 - Sheldon: Shedding the yoke of my oppressors, you blind, sad little man.\\
147 - Security Guard: Don't move. Code A-A-23, A-A-23.\\
148 - Voice: Copy.\\
149 - Sheldon: I can see the ranch, Leonard. Oh, it's rustic, it's lovely. I'd take a picture, but people are chasing me. I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it. They have Tasers, but they wouldn't dare use... Aaaaaaagh!\\
150 - [ Mrs Wolowitz's house ]\\
151 - Howard: Come on, Raj. You are the King Kong of Ping-Pong. You are the menace of table tennis. Put her away, 'cause I don't have a third one. Yes! Yes! (whoops)\\
152 - Amy: Rajesh eight, Penny four.\\
153 - Penny: Sorry, he's really good.\\
154 - Bernadette: Hey, Raj. if Howard can't keep the TARDIS, how great would it look at your place?\\
155 - Raj: What?\\
156 - Howard: Yeah, what?\\
157 - Bernadette: I don't know much about Doctor Who, but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the TARDIS, which is pretty cool 'cause on the show, the inside of the TARDIS is bigger than the outside. But then again, I don't know much about Doctor Who.\\
158 - Howard: Don't listen to her. You and I go way back, we're like brothers.\\
159 - Raj: We are. We are. Oh, no. What a terrible serve. Sorry, brother.\\
160 - Amy: Eight-five.\\
161 - Howard: This is ridiculous. I want a new champion. Amy, were you serious about being able to serve?\\
162 - Amy: Uh, it, it's been a long time. I don't know. I'm probably pretty rusty.\\
163 - Penny: Wow.\\
164 - Howard: She's my champion.\\
165 - Bernadette: Well, if you can switch champions, so can I. I want Raj.\\
166 - Penny: Hey.\\
167 - Bernadette: Oh, come on, like you even care.\\
168 - Penny: I care. Oh, wait, no, I don't. Good luck, Raj.\\
169 - Howard: You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you.\\
170 - Raj: So did I.\\
171 - [ An office in Skywalker Ranch ]\\
172 - Sheldon: Do you think they're gonna call the police?\\
173 - Leonard: I don't know. Maybe they'll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.\\
174 - Sheldon: Oh, I think that's below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer. Stormtroopers are really the ones who...\\
175 - Leonard: Oh, shut up.\\
176 - Nerdy Guy: He's right. Uh, Stormtroopers actually combine both the function of infantry and military police.\\
177 - Leonard: Uh-huh, I'm normally very nice, but you shut up, too.\\
178 - Sheldon: So, what are you in for?\\
179 - Nerdy Guy: Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas and say thank you. You know, growing up, the movies had such an impact on my life. I never really fit in anywhere. Till I discovered the worlds he created and finally found a place where I belong.\\
180 - Sheldon: But why are you here?\\
181 - Nerdy Guy: Oh, I, uh, I hopped a fence, and they caught me in the sculpture gallery making out with a Chewbacca statue.\\
182 - Sheldon: Excuse me. Leonard, they have a sculpture gallery.\\
183 - Security Guard: All right, I talked to my supervisor, and we're gonna let you go with a warning. (sighs in relief) But if you ever come back, we will call the police and press charges.\\
184 - Leonard: We understand. Thank you so much.\\
185 - Nerdy Guy: Uh, what about me?\\
186 - Security Guard: No, you're not going anywhere, kissy face. Let's go. I have to take your picture to post at the guard gate.\\
187 - Sheldon: Uh, one question about that picture. Can it be with George Lucas? (imitating Yoda) Ooh, grumpy you are.\\
188 - [ Mrs Wolowitz's house ]\\
189 - Howard: Okay, this is the match that decides it all. First to 11 wins. Serve switches every five points. And just so you know, when this started, I was going to put the TARDIS in a discreet corner of the house, but I've since turned mean, and now it's going right in the middle of the living room on a rotating platform with a sign that says "suck it". Game on.\\
190 - Bernadette: Except, Raj is gonna win. Isn't that right, Raj?\\
191 - Raj: Uh, yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good.\\
192 - Bernadette: Come on, get in her head. Be intimidating.\\
193 - Raj: Okay, uh, I'm gonna own you, bitch.\\
194 - Penny: Whoa.\\
195 - Bernadette: Hey.\\
196 - Amy: That's not nice.\\
197 - Raj: Let's just play.\\
198 - Howard: One-zero. Two. Three. Four. Five-nothing. (chuckles) Wait, did you play badminton or sad-minton?\\
199 - Bernadette: Don't listen to him, all she's got is a serve. Now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away.\\
200 - Raj: What, and that's not offensive? Where's the line?\\
201 - Penny: It's in your purse. Play.\\
202 - Bernadette: One-five. Two-five. Three-five. Four-five. Five-five.\\
203 - Howard: Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-five.\\
204 - Bernadette: Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-ten.\\
205 - Amy: Well, that was an exciting 40 seconds.\\
206 - Howard: It was, and now the serve is back to you, and the game is over.\\
207 - Bernadette: You know, Amy, I, uh, can't help but wonder how Sheldon would react if the TARDIS was at your place.\\
208 - Howard: Don't listen to her, just hit the ball.\\
209 - Amy: Keep talking.\\
210 - [ Amy's apartment ]\\
211 - Bernadette: If this doesn't get him into your bedroom, nothing will.\\
212 - [ The stairwell ]\\
213 - Sheldon: Are you still mad at me?\\
214 - Leonard: Yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested, and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee.\\
215 - Sheldon: Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty.\\
216 - Leonard: The glass is empty, Sheldon. It's completely empty. If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst, he would be dead, do you know why?\\
217 - Sheldon: Before I answer, was he a smoker? I think you're looking at this all wrong.\\
218 - Leonard: Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it.\\
219 - Sheldon: Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in. And no one we know can say that. And for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser.\\
220 - Leonard: That part was pretty good.\\
221 - Sheldon: See?\\
222 - Leonard: You did flop around a lot.\\
223 - Sheldon: I'll take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate.\\
224 - Leonard: You know, when they were escorting us to the detaining room, I looked through a door, and I'm pretty sure I saw a display case with the Ark of the Covenant.\\
225 - Sheldon: That's amazing.\\
226 - Leonard: I know.\\
227 - Sheldon: And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle. Although that was right after the Tasing, so who can say for sure?\\
228 - Leonard: I guess this could count as an adventure.\\
229 - Sheldon: It was. And even though we're not allowed back there, they can never take today away from us. Unlike my sense of smell, which hasn't returned since the Tasing. No, I got nothing.\\
230 - [ Amy's bedroom ]\\
231 - Sheldon: Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail, quick, we need to reset the time circuits. Oh, no, I left my sonic screwdriver behind.\\
232 - Amy: Really should have thought this through.

2 - Raj: You're wrong.\\
3 - Howard: No, I'm not.\\
4 - Raj: Yes, you are.\\
5 - Howard: No, I'm not. Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet, are they called gifs or jifs?\\
6 - Leonard: Well, the G stands for graphics. That's a hard G, so I'd say gif.\\
7 - Raj: The guy who invented it says it's jif.\\
8 - Howard: I'm sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?\\
9 - Sheldon: Well, I'll give you three guesses why I'm so irritated.\\
10 - Howard: Something happened different from the way you wanted it.\\
11 - Sheldon: I guess news travels fast. It's true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasn't included.\\
12 - Leonard: Oh, Sheldon, I'm sure it's not because they don't think you're an elite scientist.\\
13 - Howard: Yeah, I bet you anything it's just 'cause you're a pain in the ass.\\
14 - Sheldon: You're just saying that to make me feel better.\\
15 - Leonard: Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.\\
16 - Sheldon: Agreed.\\

31 - [ Mrs Wolowitz's house ]\\
32 - Bernadette: Hey, Raj.\\
33 - Raj: Hey, I got you a little gift.\\
34 - Bernadette: Oh, that's a lot of Girl Scout Cookies.\\
35 - Raj: You know me. I'm from India. I can't resist children begging. So, how's it going with the title to the house?\\
36 - Howard: Great, it's all done. The lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. I didn't have to meet him, I didn't have to talk to him, I don't even know where he is.\\
37 - Raj: Wow, so you're not curious at all?\\
38 - Howard: Nope.\\
39 - Raj: Hmm. What if he's in prison? What if he's a spy? What if he's in a Beatles cover band? I'm just saying, if he's got your nose and haircut, he'd make a killer Ringo.\\
40 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
41 - Wil Wheaton: Thanks again for agreeing to do this.\\
42 - Penny: Oh, it's cool, I've never been on a podcast before.\\
43 - Leonard: Well, you picked a good one to start. Wil's had lots of great guests. Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden.\\
44 - Penny: Those are Star Trek people.\\
45 - Leonard: Yes.\\
46 - Penny: I only figured that out because I've never heard of any of them.\\
47 - Wil: I deserve that. I invited you on my show and I drove here.\\
48 - Penny: Sorry.\\
49 - Wil: Okay, so, this is basically gonna be just like a little talk show. Uh, we're gonna take some calls, we'll talk about what it was like on the set of Serial Ape-ist 2. It should be really fun.\\
50 - Leonard: This is exciting.\\
51 - Penny: Yeah, so, how many people listen?\\
52 - Wil: Most people download it later, but usually a few thousand people listen live.\\
53 - Penny: What? A few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff?\\
54 - Wil: Again, right in the ears, straight to the feelings.\\
55 - [ The apartment ]\\
56 - Amy: Can you please pass the salt?\\
57 - Sheldon: Sure. It's not like I was invited to Richard Feynman's house and have anything better to do.\\
58 - Amy: Is this how the rest of the night's going to be?\\
59 - Sheldon: I don't know the future. Do you think there's a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman's house and everyone in it?\\
60 - Amy: No, Sheldon.\\
61 - Sheldon: Then buckle up, you're in for a cranky night.\\
62 - Amy: According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, we're not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.\\
63 - Sheldon: You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.\\
64 - Amy: Well, it applies to you, too.\\
65 - Sheldon: I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as you're concerned, I'm smiling. Although, I must admit, I'm smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant.\\
66 - [ Mrs Wolowitz's house ]\\
67 - Raj: So, Bernadette, have you thought about how you're going to redecorate this place?\\
68 - Bernadette: You know, I'm thinking ripping up the carpets, maybe lose the wallpaper, all new light fixtures.\\
69 - Raj: You know, if you knocked out this wall, it would give you an open floor plan, and then, it's a little scary, but could be fun, indoor fire pit.\\
70 - (doorbell rings)\\
71 - Howard: Hey, I grew up in this house, okay? No one's knocking anything down.\\
72 - Bernadette: Okay, okay. When he's at Comic-Con, I'm bringing in a wrecking ball.\\
73 - Howard: Can I help you?\\
74 - Guy at door: Hi. Are you Howard Wolowitz?\\
75 - Howard: Yes.\\
76 - Guy: Um, this is a little weird, but a lawyer was trying to contact my father, because his name was still on the title for this house.\\
77 - Howard: Wuh, uh, who's your father?\\
78 - Guy: Sam Wolowitz.\\
79 - Howard: S-Sam Wolowitz is my father.\\
80 - Guy: I know.\\
81 - Howard: Well, wait, so if we have the same father, are, are you saying you're my half-brother?\\
82 - Guy: I think so.\\
83 - Howard: Bernadette, weird things are happening out here.\\
84 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
85 - Penny: I think I started to suspect it was a bad movie when I looked at the script and saw the title, Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill.\\
86 - Wil: Uh, spoiler alert, after the monkey sees, it kills.\\
87 - Leonard: Psst.\\
88 - Wil: I've just been handed a note. I'm going to read it. "Wil, do you want more Diet Coke? Also, we have juice."\\
89 - Leonard: I-I didn't want to interrupt.\\
90 - Wil: Uh, that voice you just heard belongs to Leonard, Penny's fiancé. Uh, Leonard, why don't you grab some headphones and join us?\\
91 - Leonard: Really?\\
92 - Wil: Yeah.\\
93 - Leonard: (chuckles) Yeah, great.\\
94 - Wil: So, while Leonard gets set up, let's take a call. Hello, caller, you are on with Penny and Wil from Serial Ape-ist 2.\\
95 - Woman Caller: I don't have a question. I just want to say I'm a big fan of the movie. I've seen it, like, ten times.\\
96 - Penny: Okay, well, I'll apologize for the first time, but the other nine are on you.\\
97 - Wil: Thanks a lot, caller. You know that the movie actually has a little bit of a cult following.\\
98 - Penny: Really?\\
99 - Wil: Yeah. I was at a science-fiction convention, and I saw a woman dressed as your half-ape character.\\
100 - Leonard: Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj.\\
101 - Wil: All right, it's time for a very special guest caller, a friend of mine, who you probably know as the director of such movies as Clerks, or from podcasts and books where he often reminds you that he's the guy who directed Clerks. Hello, Kevin Smith.\\
102 - Kevn: Hey, man, yo, is everything okay, Wil? 'Cause it's been, like, two minutes and you haven't even brought up Stand By Me.\\
103 - Penny: Hey, Kevin. It's really exciting to talk to you.\\
104 - Leonard: It really is.\\
105 - Kevin: Oh, you guys are very sweet. So, Penny, listen, I saw your movie.\\
106 - Penny: Oh, wow. I wish it was better.\\
107 - Wil: Oh, don't worry about it. Have you seen some of Kevin's films?\\
108 - Kevin: You're cruisin' for a beatin', Wheaton. Anyway, man, I dug the ape movie, Penny. And I thought you were, like, really great in it.\\
109 - Penny: Aw.\\
110 - Wil: You know, I'm in the movie, too.\\
111 - Kevin: Yeah, whatever. Penny. Penny, how come you're not in more stuff, man? I'd cast you in a minute.\\
112 - Penny: Seriously?\\
113 - Kevin: Oh, yeah, man. I'm actually in pre-production on a movie right now. Way different than anything I've ever done before. It's called Clerks 3. You should come over and read for a part.\\
114 - Penny: Oh, my, I would love that.\\
115 - Leonard: You have a new job.\\
116 - Penny: Well, maybe I can do both.\\
117 - Leonard: I don't think you can do both.\\
118 - Penny: I don't think I asked you.\\
119 - Kevin: Yeah, you tell him, Penny.\\
120 - Leonard: Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.\\
121 - [ The apartment ]\\
122 - Sheldon: Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?\\
123 - Amy: Probably not. It's an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.\\
124 - Sheldon: You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but I've since evolved, and now I think it's dumb.\\
125 - Amy: Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do.\\
126 - Sheldon: Hey, look at that. Even in your example, you're all by yourself.\\
127 - Amy: When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees.\\
128 - Sheldon: I can just picture them all right now at Feynman's house, probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger. See? They're missing out on hilarious jokes like that.\\
129 - Amy: And at the same time, not.\\
130 - Sheldon: It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn't let me in. I hated that so much.\\
131 - Amy: You know, there's nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort.\\
132 - Sheldon: Isn't that a little juvenile?\\
133 - Amy: More juvenile than this?\\
134 - Sheldon: I'll get the blankets. You Google how to have childlike fun.\\
135 - [ Mrs Wolowitz's house ]\\
136 - Howard: You know what, I'm being a bad host. Let me get some more coffee.\\
137 - Bernadette: Oh, let me do it, Howard.\\
138 - Howard: No, I got it.\\
139 - Bernadette: So, Josh, what do you do?\\
140 - Josh: I'm studying oceanography down in San Diego.\\
141 - Bernadette: Oh, how nice. I loved Finding Nemo.\\
142 - Raj: Enough chitchat. How do we know you are who you say you are?\\
143 - Josh: Why would I lie?\\
144 - Raj: Okay, you got me there. You here looking for money?\\
145 - Josh: No.\\
146 - Raj: A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?\\
147 - Josh: No.\\
148 - Raj: You're in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.\\
149 - Bernadette: Why don't you help with the coffee?\\
150 - Raj: Okay, but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting, and I'd like to learn more about it. Hey, you okay?\\
151 - Howard: Not really. This guy shows up out of the blue, and now I have a brother? My father has another family?\\
152 - Raj: I get it. What do you want to do?\\
153 - Howard: I don't know. I, I'd just like him to go away. I can't deal with this.\\
154 - Raj: All right, I've got your back.\\
155 - Howard: Thank you. Come on. And I'd like to point out, this wall just provided a lot of privacy.\\
156 - Josh: I can't believe my brother's an astronaut. That's amazing. What was it like?\\
157 - Raj: Listen, dude, it's time for you to hit the road.\\
158 - Howard: Hey, hey, the young man asked a good question.\\
159 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
160 - Wil: So, for those of you just tuning in, we are listening to a really fun fight between my co-star...\\
161 - Leonard: No, no, no. We're not fighting, we're just having a conversation.\\
162 - Wil: All right. We're listening to a really fun conversation between my co-star from Serial Ape-ist 2 and her fiancé, who doesn't believe women should have dreams.\\
163 - Leonard: Give me back that juice.\\
164 - Penny: What is the harm if I audition?\\
165 - Leonard: Well, what if you get it?\\
166 - Penny: I don't know, I make a movie, become rich and famous, win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and live an incredibly wonderful life.\\
167 - Leonard: From a Kevin Smith movie?\\
168 - Kevin: Oh, I'm hanging up now.\\
169 - Wil: Don't you listen to him, buddy. You're awesome. You're one of the greatest directors of our time.\\
170 - Kevin: I don't have a part for you, Wheaton.\\
171 - Wil: And that was Kevin Smith.\\
172 - Penny: Thanks a lot.\\
173 - Leonard: I'm just trying to protect you. How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?\\
174 - Penny: Okay, instead of protecting me, why don't you try being excited when something good happens?\\
175 - Leonard: I'm always excited for you. I'm excited that you found this new job where you're making decent money.\\
176 - Penny: Decent? I make twice what you make.\\
177 - Leonard: Wait, twice?\\
178 - Penny: Yeah.\\
179 - Leonard: Like, times two twice?\\
180 - Wil: For those of you at home, Leonard just found out his fiancée makes way more money than he does. Let's listen.\\
181 - Leonard: I went to school for half my life. I have a doctorate. I'm still paying off college loans.\\
182 - Penny: Well, how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out.\\
183 - Leonard: Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?\\
184 - Wil: For those of you at home, I am shaking my head no.\\
185 - [ The apartment. Including fort ]\\
186 - Amy: How's it going, Sheldon?\\
187 - Sheldon: Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights.\\
188 - Amy: Can I come in?\\
189 - Sheldon: Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket.\\
190 - Amy: Amazing.\\
191 - Sheldon: I know. This isn't the printout. This is my real face.\\
192 - Amy: What are we doing? This is a fort. Let's sit on the floor.\\
193 - Sheldon: Roughing it? Okay. Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels.\\
194 - [ Mrs Wolowitz's house ]\\
195 - Howard: I'm surprised you could hear me with this Thin Mint in your ear. Yeah, pretty cool, huh?\\
196 - Josh: Yeah. Anyway, I should probably get going.\\
197 - Bernadette: Howie, have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic?\\
198 - Josh: Sorry, I have a long drive.\\
199 - Howard: Well, I hope I get to see you again.\\
200 - Josh: (chuckles) I hope so, too. I've always dreamed of having a brother to play catch with.\\
201 - Bernadette: Keep dreaming.\\
202 - Howard: Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game.\\
203 - Josh: Wow.\\
204 - Bernadette: He did it with a robot.\\
205 - Josh: You had s*x with a robot?\\
206 - Howard: That's not what she meant.\\
207 - Raj: But technically, yes.\\
208 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
209 - Leonard: Hang on, if you're making all this money, where is it?\\
210 - Penny: In a safe place.\\
211 - Leonard: What does that mean, under your bed?\\
212 - Penny: No, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. I'm not overly conservative. I'm young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks.\\
213 - Leonard: Wait a minute, you have "a guy"?\\
214 - Penny: Don't you have a guy?\\
215 - Leonard: Why would I have a guy? I don't have any money.\\
216 - Penny: Oh, sweetie, you should really get some money.\\
217 - Wil: For those of you listening at home, how great is this?\\
218 - Leonard: Wil, I'm begging you, just please turn that off.\\
219 - Wil: Sure. And we're back.\\
220 - Penny: Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. This is the way life is. And I'm sure in time they'll change again.\\
221 - Leonard: Great, you're not only more successful than me, now you're more mature.\\
222 - Penny: Okay, look, would it make you feel better if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?\\
223 - Leonard: That would be great, thank you.\\
224 - Wil: I'm just gonna jump in here real quick. Leonard, a moment ago, you were dead set against Penny resuming her acting career, but now you're all for it. Is it fair to say that she played you like a violin?\\
225 - Leonard: Yes, it is, Wil.\\
226 - [ Mrs Wolowitz's house ]\\
227 - Josh: So, I have to ask, was the robot sexy?\\
228 - Howard: (chuckles) It was actually just a mechanical hand.\\
229 - Josh: 'Cause that's all you need, right?\\
230 - Howard: You are my brother.\\
231 - [ The fort ]\\
232 - Sheldon: Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or "fort off", are, Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket.\\
233 - Amy: I'd say, Knox over Ticonderoga, 'cause it's got the gold.\\
234 - Sheldon: Mm-hmm.\\
235 - Amy: And McBlanket over Sumter 'cause it has a higher thread count. (phone rings) Oh. Ten o'clock. Date night's over.\\
236 - Sheldon: Wait, no. We haven't picked a winner.\\
237 - Amy: We both know this one's gonna win.\\
238 - Sheldon: Well, of course we do. Fort Knox doesn't have a secret physics lending library.\\
239 - Amy: Come on, I'll help you take this down.\\
240 - Sheldon: Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?\\
241 - Amy: Well, as long as we're suspending the parameters, I could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover.\\
242 - Sheldon: That's a big step.\\
243 - Amy: It's a big fort.\\
244 - Sheldon: Very well. I will agree to a family-friendly, G-rated, boy-girl sleepover.\\
245 - Amy: PG. Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.\\
246 - Sheldon: G-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers.\\
247 - Amy: You got yourself a sleepover.\\
248 - Sheldon: Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?\\
249 - Amy: Would it alarm you to know that I hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?\\
250 - Sheldon: It would, but you know how much I admire preparedness. How did you know we'd be in the living room?\\
251 - Amy: Who says this is the only one I hid?\\
252 - [ The apartment ]\\
253 - Leonard: Hello? What is this?\\
254 - Sheldon: We built a fort.\\
255 - Leonard: Are those my sheets?\\
256 - Amy: Yes, they are.\\
257 - Leonard: Okay. Well, you kids have fun. I'm gonna go to sleep.\\
258 - Sheldon: Well, Leonard, don't you want to see the inside of the fort?\\
259 - Leonard: Yeah, I'm good.\\
260 - Sheldon: Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can't come in.\\
261 - Leonard: Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?\\
262 - Sheldon: I want to say no, but it's too glorious. Get in here.\\
263 - Leonard: Thank you.\\
264 - Amy: Okay, have a seat on the floor.\\
265 - Sheldon: Not there. That's my spot.

1 - [ The cafeteria ]\\
2 - Sheldon: Hey, would you like to hear some songs I've rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?\\
3 - Howard: Sure.\\
4 - Leonard: Really?\\
5 - Howard: Yeah. Well, I like music, I like science, I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it.\\
6 - Sheldon:  There was a scientist who had a theory \\
7 -  And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o \\
8 -  J-A-M-E-S \\
9 -  C-L-E-R-K \\
10 -  Space M-A-X-W-E-L-L \\
11 -  And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o \\
12 -  There was a scientist who had a theory \\
13 -  And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o \\
14 -  A-M-E-S \\
15 - Leonard: Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we, we get it.\\
16 - Sheldon: Perhaps you'd prefer this one. (clears throat)\\
17 -  The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all \\
18 -  Because it has eight legs \\
19 -  And two body parts \\
20 - Leonard: That's pretty cool, Sheldon.\\
21 - Sheldon: Thank you. Do either of you know Beyoncé? I'd love her to get behind it.\\
22 - Raj: Hey.\\
23 - Leonard: Hey.\\
24 - Howard: Hey.\\
25 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
26 - Raj: You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASA's been working on?\\
27 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
28 - Raj: Well, they're looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life.\\
29 - Leonard: Oh. When I encountered alien life, I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.\\
30 - Sheldon: All right, you can't breathe our air without an inhaler, he's allergic to Earth nuts, but I'm the alien.\\
31 - Raj: Anyway, I'm among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system.\\
32 - Sheldon: Excellent.\\
33 - Howard: Good for you.\\
34 - Leonard: Congratulations.\\
35 - Raj: And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.\\
36 - Leonard: Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?\\
37 - Sheldon: I'll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm.\\
38 - Howard: Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities.\\
39 - Sheldon: Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.\\
40 - Howard: Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged for cross-sensory transposition?\\
41 - Raj: Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard, you're on the team.\\
42 - Leonard: My mommy raised a gentleman.\\
43 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
44 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
45 -  The Earth began to cool \\
46 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
47 -  We built the Wall \\
48 -  We built the pyramids \\

55 - Original Air Date on April 16, 2015\\
56 - [ Raj's apartment ]\\
57 - Raj: Hey. Thanks for coming by.\\
58 - Leonard: Yeah. I'm excited to help.\\
59 - Raj: I would have included the others, but you know exactly what would've happened. They would've taken over the project and bossed us around.\\
60 - Leonard: I get it. Uh, just this morning, Sheldon wouldn't let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict.\\
61 - Raj: You should have told him to mind his own business.\\
62 - Leonard: Yeah. That's better than what I did say, which was, fine, I'll eat them with club soda.\\
63 - Raj: What makes them think they're always in charge of everything?\\
64 - Leonard: Mmm, they're alpha males.\\
65 - Raj: (chuckles) Huh, what does that make us?\\
66 - Leonard: We could be betas. They're second in charge.\\
67 - Raj: Okay, that sounds good.\\
68 - Leonard: Or we could be omegas. They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.\\
69 - Raj: Okay, that sounds like us.\\
70 - Leonard: Whatever. There's no alphas here, and this is your project. You're in charge. How do you want to start?\\
71 - Raj: I don't know. How do you want to start?\\
72 - Leonard: I don't know. Should we call Sheldon and Howard?\\
73 - Raj: No. We can do this by ourselves.\\
74 - Leonard: Okay. Great. How do you want to start?\\
75 - Raj: I don't know. How do you want to start?\\
76 - [ The hallway ]\\
77 - Penny: (Knocks) Sheldon. (Knocks) Sheldon. (Knocks) Sheldon.\\
78 - Sheldon: I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it.\\
79 - Penny: Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.\\
80 - Sheldon: I don't recommend it. You'll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway, if you're looking for Leonard, he's with Koothrappali.\\
81 - Penny: Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you.\\
82 - Sheldon: How nice. Here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags.\\
83 - Penny: No, no. It's about my acting career.\\
84 - Sheldon: Oh, sorry. That's not on the list.\\
85 - Penny: Well.\\
86 - Sheldon: Oh, wait. No. How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy.\\
87 - Penny: Okay, look, here's the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales, it's going great, but I have an audition for a movie, and if I get it, it could screw everything up.\\
88 - Sheldon: Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.\\
89 - Penny: Well, why? (sighs)\\
90 - Sheldon: I'm attempting to turn over a new leaf. Earlier today, it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people.\\
91 - Penny: You're really not gonna tell me?\\
92 - Sheldon: No, that train has left the station. Now, we can play this one of two ways. You can say, "trains, tell me more," or you can just look at me like that and I'll start.\\
93 - [ Howard and Bernadette's house ]\\
94 - Bernadette: What's going on in here?\\
95 - Howard: I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.\\
96 - Bernadette: (chuckles) Oh. How do you drink it?\\
97 - Howard: Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit.\\
98 - Bernadette: I think I'll have a beer.\\
99 - Howard: First take a picture with me.\\
100 - Bernadette: Why?\\
101 - Howard: Well, Raj and I always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself and I'm putting this on Instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. Say cheese.\\
102 - Bernadette: Is this about the space probe he's working on without you?\\
103 - Howard: You betcha. The very one.\\
104 - Bernadette: Howard, you're grown men. You guys don't have to do everything together.\\
105 - Howard: I know. That's why I'm spending tonight with you.\\
106 - Bernadette: Trying to hurt Raj's feelings.\\
107 - Howard: With my honeybunch.\\
108 - Bernadette: You're being childish.\\
109 - Howard: No. He is. So I have a dominant personality. We all know that.\\
110 - Bernadette: I'm sorry. What do we know?\\
111 - Howard: In social groupings, I just naturally wind up in charge.\\
112 - Bernadette: Don't take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?\\
113 - Howard: You don't think I'm a leader?\\
114 - Bernadette: I was kidding. Of course you are.\\
115 - Howard: Right. I couldn't change if I wanted to.\\
116 - Bernadette: You better not change, because I love who you are. Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you're done or can you do it all by yourself?\\
117 - Howard: All by myself.\\
118 - Bernadette: There's my big boss man.\\
119 - [ The apartment ]\\
120 - Sheldon: So, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, I prefer the more accurate cow exploder.\\
121 - Penny: Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question.\\
122 - Sheldon: Mmm.\\
123 - Penny: If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?\\
124 - Sheldon: Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?\\
125 - Penny: No.\\
126 - Sheldon: All right, then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information.\\
127 - Penny: Oh. You're right. I'm worried about something that hasn't even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.\\
128 - Sheldon: Well, Penny, who's smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?\\
129 - Penny: Oh, I guess you're right. Maybe it is the person who asks.\\
130 - Sheldon: No, it's the wise man. That's why he's called the wise man. You know how I know that? I'm the wise man.\\
131 - Penny: I'm sorry. What was I thinking?\\
132 - Sheldon: Uh, just out of curiosity, why didn't you ask Leonard for advice about this?\\
133 - Penny: 'Cause I already know what he'll say. (whining voice) "Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn't do it."\\
134 - Sheldon: Ah, it's just like he's here.\\
135 - [ Raj's apartment ]\\
136 - Raj: Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the Golden Record on Voyager, were heavily criticized.\\
137 - Leonard: Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player.\\
138 - Raj: Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.\\
139 - Leonard: That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.\\
140 - Raj: Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die.\\
141 - Leonard: My God, when he's on the table and they use the paddles on him.\\
142 - Raj: And he's all white.\\
143 - Leonard: They zip him up in that bag.\\
144 - Raj: And Gertie can't stop crying.\\
145 - Leonard: The flower dies.\\
146 - Raj: Okay, let's talk about something else.\\
147 - Leonard: All right, so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that's simple.\\
148 - Raj: And doesn't require outside machinery to be built to access it.\\
149 - Leonard: It's also a problem because we don't even know if the aliens who find this can see. I mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us.\\
150 - Raj: Like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers.\\
151 - Leonard: That's actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent.\\
152 - Raj: Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs.\\
153 - Leonard: Yeah. Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.\\
154 - Raj: Okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well.\\
155 - Leonard: The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch.\\
156 - Raj: Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium.\\
157 - Leonard: All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system.\\
158 - Raj: We, we can totally do that.\\
159 - Leonard: I know.\\
160 - Raj: This is great.\\
161 - Leonard: Yeah, you know what else it is?\\
162 - Raj: What?\\
163 - Howard: Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.\\
164 - Raj: Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers.\\
165 - [ The cafeteria ]\\
166 - Sheldon:  It's the eye of the tiger \\
167 -  It's the ear of the bat \\
168 -  It's the whiskers of the catfish \\
169 -  And the walrus... \\
170 - Howard: Hang on. Not that your song isn't terrible, it is... but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?\\
171 - Sheldon: You didn't let me finish.\\
172 -  And also regarding the bat \\
173 -  It has sonar. \\
174 - Leonard: Hey.\\
175 - Howard: Hello.\\
176 - Raj: Look, I know you guys are upset, but we've talked about it, and we think it'd be beneficial for you to be part of the project.\\
177 - Howard: Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?\\
178 - Sheldon: I'm sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.\\
179 - Leonard: We want you back on the project with us.\\
180 - Sheldon: Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?\\
181 - Raj: Look, we admit it. The idea that you guys came up with was really good, and I'd love your help.\\
182 - Howard: I suppose it couldn't have been easy for you to say that.\\
183 - Raj: It wasn't, so are you in?\\
184 - Sheldon: Certainly.\\
185 - Howard: Sure.\\
186 - Leonard: Great. Now that we're all on the same page, let's get together tonight and work on it.\\
187 - Sheldon: "Get together tonight"? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj.\\
188 - Raj: Okay, I think we should do it right now.\\
189 - Sheldon: Tonight works better for me.\\
190 - Raj: Okay.\\
191 - [ A hallway ]\\
192 - Penny (V.O.): Okay, it's just an audition. Why am I nervous? Maybe it's a good thing. Just means I want it. And I can have it. This feels right. Why did I ever give this up?(Out loud)  I'm starting to remember.\\
193 - [ The apartment ]\\
194 - Raj: So, I'd like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it.\\
195 - Sheldon: Uh, building on that, we should order dinner.\\
196 - Leonard: How is that building on what he just said?\\
197 - Howard: Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese.\\
198 - Raj: Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said.\\
199 - Sheldon: Building on building on that, there's a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.\\
200 - Leonard: Building on that, I'd like to remind you, I'm lactose intolerant.\\
201 - Howard: I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.\\
202 - Sheldon: Bah, you didn't say building on. You're out.\\
203 - Leonard: It's not Simon Says.\\
204 - Raj: Yeah, you're missing the point, Sheldon.\\
205 - Sheldon: You're out, and you're out. I win. Who wants pizza?\\
206 - [ The audition room ]\\
207 - Girl: Penny?\\
208 - Penny: Oh, hey.\\
209 - Girl: Hey. I haven't seen you auditioning in a while.\\
210 - Penny: Yeah, uh, I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep.\\
211 - Girl: You quit acting?\\
212 - Penny: Well, kind of. But now I get to act like inflamed heart is only a "mild side effect." (laughs)\\
213 - Second Girl: I heard you can make good money doing that.\\
214 - Penny: Yeah, it's going okay, but I do miss this sometimes.\\
215 - First Girl: Really?\\
216 - Penny: Mmm.\\
217 - First Girl: 'Cause I got to tell you, I am so sick of the humiliation and being treated like a piece of meat.\\
218 - Audiitoner: Chelsea?\\
219 - First Girl: Wish me luck. (laughs)\\
220 - Second Girl: They're gonna love you. I heard she's pushing 40 and everything's fake.\\
221 - Penny: Yeah. I started that rumour.\\
222 - [ The apartment ]\\
223 - Leonard: Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be.\\
224 - Raj: Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.\\
225 - Howard: The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.\\
226 - Sheldon: Yeah, I never cared for that. It's advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are.\\
227 - Leonard: Squeeze yourself.\\
228 - Sheldon: Oh, don't be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency.\\
229 - Raj: Well, maybe there's a way to appear non-aggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger.\\
230 - Howard: You want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? That's ridiculous.\\
231 - Raj: Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?\\
232 - Sheldon: Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard.\\
233 - Raj: (sighs) Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over.\\
234 - Howard: It's not always.\\
235 - Leonard: What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba's head, and I got to be his fat slug butt.\\
236 - Sheldon: We looked great.\\
237 - Leonard: You let a guy sit on me.\\
238 - Howard: He was dressed as Princess Leia. It made a nice picture.\\
239 - Leonard: I'm just saying, sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside.\\
240 - Raj: Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA, you didn't even think to ask me and Leonard.\\
241 - Howard: You know what? You're right. I should have asked you.\\
242 - Sheldon: Yeah, and if he does ask you, go. It's amazing.\\
243 - Howard: Okay, and if we're talking about being left out of things, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.\\
244 - Sheldon: Oh, I recommend that, too. That was a magical experience.\\
245 - Leonard: Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.\\
246 - Sheldon: I sure did. Oh, my goodness. Well, from Jabba's head to ice cream with Darth Vader, I'm having a heck of a ride. Yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when I'm in charge. Now, why don't you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?\\
247 - Leonard: Sheldon, you're not in charge. Raj is in charge.\\
248 - Sheldon: Leonard, who's really in charge? The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?\\
249 - Raj: He's right. If you think about it, we're all in charge.\\
250 - Sheldon: No, the guy in charge is in ch... why is everyone so bad at these?\\
251 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
252 - Penny: I mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much I hated about that world. You, you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity. I don't want to feel those things. I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things.\\
253 - Amy: I can't believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie.\\
254 - Penny: I did. I mean, I walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out.\\
255 - Bernadette: Well, I'm glad you have a new appreciation for your job.\\
256 - Penny: I do, and you know, I don't think I've ever thanked you properly for helping me get it.\\
257 - Bernadette: Properly, at all. It's just words I've never heard.\\
258 - Penny: Well, thank you. You're a good friend, and you changed my life.\\
259 - Bernadette: You're welcome. Hey, now that you're making some real money, maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner.\\
260 - Penny: Sure.\\
261 - Amy: And you probably have to invite your other friend 'cause she overheard you talking about it, and it would be awkward to exclude her.\\
262 - Penny: Okay.\\
263 - Bernadette: How about now?\\
264 - Penny: All right.\\
265 - Bernadette: Don't forget your wallet.\\
266 - Penny: I, uh, huh. (groans)\\
267 - [ An alien spacecraft ]\\
268 - Sheldon (on screen): Greetings from planet Earth. Just turn left at Alpha Centauri. You can't miss it.\\
269 - First Alien: That soft pink alien looks delicious.\\
270 - Second Alien: I could eat.

3 - Howard: I'll figure it out.\\
4 - Raj: It streams HD video straight to your phone while it's flying.\\
5 - Howard: Nice. Where were you when I was single?\\
6 - Leonard: Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?\\
7 - Penny: Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things, you know, makeup, underwear, clothes.\\
8 - Sheldon: If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, you're packed.\\
9 - Amy: Leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?\\
10 - Leonard: Nope. It's pretty exciting.\\
11 - Sheldon: Aren't you afraid of being blinded?\\
12 - Leonard: How would I be blinded?\\
13 - Sheldon: At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. It's all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye.\\
14 - Leonard: I'll take my chances.\\
15 - Sheldon: Fine. I wonder if they make I told you so cards in braille.\\
16 - Raj: Look, the problem with commencement speeches is that they're boring. Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?\\
17 - Howard: Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?\\
18 - Raj: I don't know. Why do I own one?\\
19 - Amy: I think it's really nice that you're sharing this experience with Penny.\\
20 - Leonard: Mm, I thought it'd be fun to show her my old stomping grounds. I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me.\\
21 - Bernadette: Well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist.\\
22 - Amy: With a beautiful girl on your arm.\\

38 - Leonard: How'd you get ready so fast?\\
39 - Penny: Oh, I pack light. Once, I got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt.\\
40 - Leonard: Why did you need a belt?\\
41 - Penny: It's called an evening look. I've never been to New Jersey before.\\
42 - Leonard: It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.\\
43 - Penny: So it's not really like that?\\
44 - Leonard: No, it's like that. Well, I'm excited to show you around.\\
45 - Penny: You think we'll have time to visit your mom over there?\\
46 - Leonard: Yes. We'll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press, but I'm not doing that either. (phone chimes) Uh-oh. I just got an alert. Our flight's been cancelled.\\
47 - Penny: What?\\
48 - Leonard: Yeah, looks like there's a big storm all up the East Coast.\\
49 - Penny: Well, can we get on another airline?\\
50 - Leonard: I don't think so.\\
51 - Penny: So, that's it? We're not going?\\
52 - Leonard: I guess not. (scoffs)\\
53 - Penny: Well, that sucks.\\
54 - Leonard: Yeah. I worked hard on that speech, too.\\
55 - Penny: Oh. You could tell it to me.\\
56 - Leonard: Oh, thank you, but I'm okay.\\
57 - Penny: Are you sure? I could pretend I'm a high school cheerleader who can't control herself around esteemed alumni.\\
58 - Leonard: Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders.\\
59 - Penny: Ooh.\\
60 - [ The apartment ]\\
61 - Howard: Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the camera's on, they're both on the same network; we should be getting an image.\\
62 - Sheldon: All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad.\\
63 - Howard: Maybe we should recalibrate it.\\
64 - Sheldon: All right.\\
65 - Howard: Step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times.\\
66 - Sheldon: It actually says "at least"?\\
67 - Howard: Yeah.\\
68 - Sheldon: Why would they say "at least"? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?\\
69 - Howard: Sheldon.\\
70 - Sheldon: You see where I'm going with this.\\
71 - Howard: Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.\\
72 - Sheldon: All right, that seems simple enough. Initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Well, I suppose ten is technically "at least ten". But they're still getting at least one angry letter.\\
73 - Howard: Now I rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green.\\
74 - Sheldon: Initiating rotation sequence. Don't look at me, initiate. Oh... What does red and yellow mean?\\
75 - Howard: It means the calibration failed. We have to start over.\\
76 - Sheldon: Oh. Very well. Re-initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... eleven. It's a good thing I didn't send that letter.\\

80 - Dr Koothrapalli: Not much, just wanted to see how my son's doing.\\
81 - Raj: Very well, thank you.\\
82 - Dr Koothrapalli: Are you still dating that dermatologist?\\
83 - Raj: If you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldn't have to ask.\\
84 - Dr Koothrapalli: Oh, and there's something else I wanted to ask you. Why did you spend a month's rent on a toy helicopter?!\\
85 - Raj: Oh, you're where that bill goes.\\
86 - Dr Koothrapalli: I'm tired of indulging your foolish lifestyle. It's time you learned responsibility. And the only way to teach you that is to cut off your allowance.\\
87 - Raj: No, Daddy, no. There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. I know, you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week.\\
88 - Dr Koothrapalli: No, my mind is made up. Starting now, you're on your own.\\
89 - Raj: But, Daddy, I, I miss my family so much, and with you and Mummy getting a divorce, I feel sad and empty. Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. So while I can't hug you every day, flying that helicopter...\\
90 - Dr Koothrapalli: I'm cutting you off.\\
91 - Raj: Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?\\
92 - [ The apartment ]\\
93 - Howard: No red and yellow, no red and yellow.\\
94 - Sheldon: Yay.\\
95 - Howard: It's green.\\
96 - Sheldon: We did it. Oh, if it's this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it.\\
97 - Howard: Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off.\\
98 - Sheldon: Oh, no.\\
99 - Howard: Oh. All right, playtime's over. Let's open this baby up.\\
100 - Sheldon: Won't that void the warranty?\\
101 - Howard: Sheldon, I have a master's degree in engineering. I wipe my bottom with warranties. Except for AppleCare. That pays for itself in the long run.\\
102 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
103 - Penny: Hi.\\
104 - Leonard: Hey, where'd you go?\\
105 - Penny: I got you a little something to cheer you up.\\
106 - Leonard: Really? s*x last night, pancakes this morning, am I dying?\\
107 - Penny: Just open it.\\
108 - Leonard: A cap and gown? Why do I need a cap and gown?\\
109 - Penny: Because you are giving your commencement speech.\\
110 - Leonard: What are you talking about?\\
111 - Penny: I called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype.\\
112 - Leonard: Really? That's amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you.\\
113 - Penny: Yeah, now about those, uh, they came from a costume shop, and all they had left was sexy graduate, so they might be a little short.\\
114 - Leonard: Short and sexy, that's my wheelhouse.\\
115 - Penny: Yeah.\\
116 - [ The apartment ]\\
117 - Howard: Boy, oh, boy, that's a lot of pieces.\\
118 - Sheldon: You know what they all do, right?\\
119 - Howard: Yes, of course.\\
120 - Sheldon: What about this one?\\
121 - Howard: Well, I, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?\\
122 - Sheldon: Not very.\\
123 - Howard: That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.\\
124 - Sheldon: So, can you get it working?\\
125 - Howard: I'm an MIT-trained engineer. I've built components for the space station.\\
126 - Sheldon: I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn't work.\\
127 - Howard: It worked fine, it just wasn't designed for Russian cosmonauts and their potato-based diet.\\
128 - Raj: Hey, guys.\\
129 - Howard: Hey.\\
130 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
131 - Raj: I have to return the helicopter. My father... What did you do?\\
132 - Sheldon: Well, don't worry. He went to MIT. He can solve any problem, as long as it doesn't originate in a Russian man's colon.\\
133 - Raj: I don't freaking believe this.\\
134 - Howard: Relax, it'll be fine.\\
135 - Raj: No, you have to put this back together right now, so I can return it.\\
136 - Sheldon: You can't return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.\\
137 - Raj: What?\\
138 - Sheldon: I think metaphorically. But he was in the bathroom for a while.\\
139 - Raj: Howard, my father cut me off. I have to get my money back for this.\\
140 - Howard: Calm down.\\
141 - Raj: Okay. Okay, you're right. It's time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life. Be a man. (On phone) Hello, Mummy.\\
142 - Mrs Koothrapalli: Hello, Rajesh. What a nice surprise.\\
143 - Raj: Well, I've been thinking about you. How are you doing? Are you happy, Mummy?\\
144 - Mrs Koothrapalli: Such a sweet boy for asking. Can't believe you come from the poison seed of your father.\\
145 - Raj: Well, I like to think I take mostly after you. Anyway, speaking of Daddy, I had a very strange conversation with him. He said he couldn't afford to send me money any more because of his active social life.\\
146 - Mrs Koothrapalli: What does that mean, active social life?\\
147 - Raj: Well, let's not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. Let's talk about you.\\
148 - Mrs Koothrapalli: Rajesh, is your father seeing someone?\\
149 - Raj: All I know, Mummy, is that he's a single wealthy doctor, and now, for some reason, there's no money for your little boy.\\
150 - Mrs Koothrapalli: Well, however much money your father was giving you, I'll give you more.\\
151 - Raj: Thank you, Mummy, I love you. (quietly) Helicopters for everybody.\\
152 - [ Penny's apartment ]\\
153 - Penny: What's taking so long?\\
154 - Leonard: I don't think this is gonna work.\\
155 - Penny: Just let me see. Sweetie, you know you're supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown.\\
156 - Leonard: A, surprised you know that. B, I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you.\\
157 - Penny: Oh. Well, you do.\\
158 - Leonard: Thank you.\\
159 - Penny: Yeah. You're gonna be on Skype, they're not gonna see your legs.\\
160 - Leonard: Well, I'm gonna go put on some pants just in case. But I have to say, this is very freeing.\\
161 - Penny: Add a belt and I'll take you some place nice.\\
162 - Leonard: Oh. Done and done.\\
163 - [ The apartment ]\\
164 - Howard: Okay, I think I've narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip.\\
165 - Sheldon: Very impressive. You know, when you're done with that, can you look at this? It doesn't make smoke anymore.\\
166 - Howard: One toy at a time.\\
167 - Sheldon: Mm. Sorry. Ah, maybe it's for the best. I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados.\\
168 - Raj: What's the first one?\\
169 - Howard: Suicide.\\
170 - Sheldon: Wrong. Obesity.\\
171 - Bernadette: I have the tool you wanted.\\
172 - Howard: Thank you.\\
173 - Raj: You guys don't have to go to the trouble. I'm back in the money now, I can just buy another helicopter.\\
174 - Howard: It's not about the money. It's about solving a problem. It's why I became an engineer. It's what I like to do, it's what I'm trained to do. It's who I am.\\
175 - Sheldon: Oh, look at you, the little engineer that could.\\
176 - Bernadette: Why don't you just call tech support?\\
177 - Howard: Hey.\\
178 - Sheldon: Whoa.\\
179 - Raj: Not cool.\\
180 - Bernadette: What?\\
181 - Howard: There's two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support.\\
182 - Bernadette: I call tech support all the time.\\
183 - Howard: Ha-ha.\\
184 - Sheldon: You call tech support.\\
185 - Raj: What a baby.\\
186 - [ Leonard's old school ]\\
187 - Headmaster: And now, for our commencement address, one of our most distinguished alumni, noted Caltech physicist Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.\\
188 - Leonard (on screen): Members of the faculty, students, I'm excited to speak to you today. I can't help but remember the last time I was in this auditorium. Two guys from the lacrosse team played keep-away with my asthma inhaler. But enough about my ten-year reunion. I'd also like to take a moment to thank my beautiful fiancée for to helping make this speech possible, even though weather nearly prevented it.\\
189 - Penny: Oh. Hello. I, I didn't know he was gonna point it at me, so, don't do drugs and stay in school.\\
190 - Leonard: They're graduating.\\
191 - Penny: Okay, bye.\\
192 - [ The apartment ]\\
193 - Howard: All right, the power supply is reconnected. I think we're back in business. Let's just run a few tests before we take it outside. Sheldon, we got WiFi?\\
194 - Sheldon: Check.\\
195 - Howard: GPS?\\
196 - Raj: Check.\\
197 - Howard: Battery charged?\\
198 - Sheldon: Check.\\
199 - Bernadette: Four hours of our lives gone? Check.\\
200 - Howard: All right. All systems go. In five...\\
201 - Together: Four, three, two, one.\\
202 - (electrical crackle)\\
203 - Sheldon: That's what my train used to do.\\
204 - Bernadette: Ready to call tech support?\\
205 - Howard: Give me the number. Probably wind up talking to some foreign guy who's reading from the same manual I have. (Raj's phone rings)\\
206 - Raj: It's my father, you jerks. Hello, Daddy.\\
207 - Dr Koothrapalli: What did you say to your mother?\\
208 - Raj: Nothing. I was just calling to check in, make sure she's doing okay.\\
209 - Dr Koothrapalli: Well, after talking to you, she seems to think I'm some sort of playboy.\\
210 - Raj: Really? I don't know where she'd get an idea like that. You know Mummy and her crazy imagination I'm so lucky I take after you.\\
211 - Dr Koothrapalli: You think you take after me?\\
212 - Raj: Well, I try to. I certainly wouldn't be a scientist if you hadn't been my role model. (Re-entering apartment) Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?\\
213 - [ Leonard's old school ]\\
214 - Leonard (on screen): It was L. Frank Baum who said, "No thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure." Wow, I'm boring myself. (sighs) Sorry, I can't see any of your faces right now, but I bet they look like this. Uh, you know, I, I wrote an entire speech to say how high school prepares you and what a wonderful place it is, but I hated it. Maybe high school's great if you look like this, but I didn't even feel like I existed at that school. And now that I think about it, I bet a lot of you feel the same way. So, for the remainder of my speech, this is for the invisible kids. Uh, maybe you never fit in. Or maybe you're the smallest kid in the school, or the heaviest or the weirdest. Maybe you're graduating and you still haven't had your first kiss. By the way, 19, and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you. Maybe you don't have any friends. And guess what? That's okay. While all the popular kids are off doing whatever, I don't know what they were doing 'cause I was never there.\\
215 - Penny: I'll, I'll tell you later.\\
216 - Leonard: My point is, while you're spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, what you're really doing is becoming interesting. And when people finally do notice you, they're gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought. And for those of you who were popular in high school, it's over, sorry. Thank you and congratulations.\\
217 - [ The apartment ]\\
218 - Tech Support (recording): Your call is important to us. All our technicians are busy helping other customers. Please stay on the line and someone will be with you shortly.\\
219 - (flute music playing)\\
220 - Howard: What happened to me? When did I become an old man baffled by modern technology? Next thing you know, I'll be hitching my pants up to my armpits and complaining about the awful music the kids are listening to.\\
221 - Sheldon: It is awful, isn't it? Listen to that noise.\\
222 - Howard: Hang on, hang on. It's working. I did it.\\
223 - Raj: How'd you do that?\\
224 - Howard: No idea, but I did it.\\
225 - Bernadette: Maybe you shouldn't be flying it inside.\\
226 - Howard: Well, I'm not flying it.\\
227 - Sheldon: Then who is?\\
228 - Howard: I don't know. Must be getting a WiFi signal from somewhere else.\\
229 - Sheldon: Initiate landing sequence. Initiate landing sequence. (screams) Hey, the camera's working. Oh, look, it's me. (screams)\\
230 - Tech Support Guy: Tech Support, can I help you?\\
231 - Sheldon: Yes, it's a robot uprising. Call the police.\\
232 - [ The hallway ]\\
233 - Leonard: So you really think they liked it?\\
234 - Penny: Oh, sweetie, it was the best speech I...\\

10 - Sheldon: You act like I didn't get you that mushroom log on Valentine's Day.\\
11 - Amy: He's right. Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years.\\
12 - Penny: You know, your mom's never been too thrilled with our relationship. Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me.\\
13 - Leonard: If you could run out and get a PhD, that might make her like you.\\

31 - [ The apartment ]\\
32 - Mrs Cooper: Shelly, I'm so proud of you and Leonard for getting this award.\\
33 - Sheldon: Oh, thank you, Mother.\\
34 - Mrs Cooper: I tried to read your paper, but it was very hard for me to understand.\\
35 - Sheldon: Oh, it's quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.\\
36 - Mrs Cooper: Interesting. You can believe that, but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense.\\
37 - Sheldon: What did they feed the lions, Mother?\\
38 - Mrs Cooper: The floating bodies of drowned sinners, of course.\\
39 - Sheldon: Listen, Leonard's mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she's here?\\
40 - Mrs Cooper: Are you ashamed of me?\\
41 - Sheldon: Of course not. I love you. I'm just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.\\
42 - Mrs Cooper: Well, I love you, too. My little bowl of lion chow.\\
43 - [ The stairwell ]\\
44 - Dr Hofstadter: So, have you and Penny set a wedding date?\\
45 - Leonard: No, we're kind of taking it slow.\\
46 - Dr Hofstadter: I see.\\
47 - Leonard: What does that mean?\\
48 - Dr Hofstadter: You've been on and off with this woman for seven years and engaged for one year. One has to wonder if there's a problem. Are you having satisfactory intercourse?\\
49 - Leonard: Yes, Mother.\\
50 - Dr Hofstadter: Only satisfactory. I see.\\
51 - Leonard: I change my answer. It, it's amazing. It's hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other.\\
52 - Dr Hofstadter: Seems odd to try and impress your mother with your sexual prowess. But then, you always did have that unresolved Oedipal complex.\\
53 - Leonard: See, this right here, what you're doing, can you please not do that around Sheldon's mom?\\
54 - Dr Hofstadter: Why? Are you attracted to her, too?\\
55 - Leonard: Of course not. She's, she's just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.\\
56 - Dr Hofstadter: Leonard, I'm an adult. I know how to conduct myself around people from different walks of life.\\
57 - Leonard: Thank you.\\
58 - Dr Hofstadter: Where is she from again?\\
59 - Leonard: East Texas.\\
60 - Dr Hofstadter: Ugh.\\
61 - Leonard: Hey, look who's here.\\
62 - Sheldon: Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, it's so good to see you again.\\
63 - Dr Hofstadter: Likewise. I read your paper, it was very impressive.\\
64 - Sheldon: Oh, thank you.\\
65 - Leonard: We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?\\
66 - Dr Hofstadter: Of course I did, but it's a mother's job to make sure her child's self-esteem is not dependent on anyone's approval.\\
67 - Leonard: That's so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.\\
68 - Sheldon: Doctor Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary.\\
69 - Dr Hofstadter: : So nice to meet you.\\
70 - Mrs Cooper: Nice to meet you, too. How was your flight?\\
71 - Dr Hofstadter: Very pleasant. And yours?\\
72 - Mrs Cooper: Lovely. Almost as if someone, not saying who, was watching over the plane.\\
73 - Dr Hofstadter: You're kidding, right?\\
74 - Leonard: Subtle, mom, real subtle.\\
75 - [ Howard and Bernadette's house ]\\
76 - Bernadette: Stuart.\\
77 - Stuart: Morning.\\
78 - Bernadette: We talked about this. I don't mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules. And rule number one is pants.\\
79 - Howard: Hey.\\
80 - [ The apartment ]\\
81 - Mrs Cooper: You must be very proud of your son.\\
82 - Dr Hofstadter: Oh, yes. He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.\\
83 - Mrs Cooper: He did?\\
84 - Dr Hofstadter: Oh, you mean this son. Uh, sure, he's terrific.\\
85 - Sheldon: Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?\\
86 - Leonard: You mean, my hypothesis. I hypothesized it all by myself.\\
87 - Dr Hofstadter: Calm down, dear. Mary, I'm curious. When did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind?\\
88 - Sheldon: Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.\\
89 - Mrs Cooper: Well, I would have to say when he was 13 and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.\\
90 - Sheldon: Ooh, this is a good one.\\
91 - Mrs Cooper: Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is ever since he was a little boy, he was always concerned with the well-being of others. And he didn't think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity, so he was gonna power the entire town for free.\\
92 - Sheldon: (stammers) Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.\\
93 - Mrs Cooper: Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable. When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad, I thought he was talking about Twinkies from one of his friends.\\
94 - Sheldon: But I wasn't. 'Cause I didn't have any friends.\\
95 - Mrs Cooper: (laughs) No. It turns out that this little scallywag was trying to use my Visa card to buy uranium from an African warlord in the country of Chad.\\
96 - Dr Hofstadter: Sounds like Sheldon was a handful.\\
97 - Mrs Cooper: Oh, he was a handful.\\
98 - Sheldon: I was a handful.\\
99 - Leonard: You still are. Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner.\\
100 - Dr Hofstadter: All right. He broke the vacuum cleaner.\\
101 - [ Howard and Bernadette's house ]\\
102 - Howard: I mean, for a while, everything was vampires. Now it's all zombies. I wonder what the next monster fad will be.\\
103 - Raj: We haven't had a good invisible man in a while.\\
104 - Stuart: Clearly, you've never seen me try to talk to a woman.\\
105 - Bernadette: Guys. In the time you've been sitting here playing video games, I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank.\\
106 - Stuart: I put on pants.\\
107 - Howard: Kiss-ass.\\
108 - Bernadette: Okay, I don't know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today. You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.\\
109 - Raj: Hey, I don't even live here.\\
110 - Bernadette: Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?\\
111 - Raj: I do. And some of it's wool, so dry flat if possible.\\
112 - [ The apartment ]\\
113 - Sheldon: Oh, and here's a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree.\\
114 - Dr Hofstadter: You don't look very happy.\\
115 - Sheldon: Well, I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life.\\
116 - Mrs Cooper: Shelly does not like change.\\
117 - Sheldon: Oh, true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen.\\
118 - Penny: Hey, sorry, got caught up at work. Hi, Beverly.\\
119 - Dr Hofstadter: Hello. Oh, okay.\\
120 - Penny: Sorry, I forgot.\\
121 - Sheldon: You remember my mother.\\
122 - Penny: Oh, yes. Hi, Mary.\\
123 - Mrs Cooper: Good to see you again, dear.\\
124 - Penny: Ah, yeah, now that's what I'm talking about.\\
125 - Leonard: So, Mom, you haven't seen Penny since we got engaged.\\
126 - Penny: Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring.\\
127 - Dr Hofstadter: Oh, lovely. Must have been very expensive.\\
128 - Sheldon: Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.\\
129 - Leonard: We did not. That's not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?\\
130 - Sheldon: Oh, sure.\\
131 - Leonard: It came from Tiffany's.\\
132 - Sheldon: You mean the box, right?\\
133 - Leonard: Keep walking.\\
134 - Penny: Really doesn't matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.\\
135 - Sheldon: Did I misspeak about the ring?\\
136 - Leonard: Yes, and we'll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You're like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.\\
137 - Sheldon: Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?\\
138 - Leonard: Yes, you are a super weaner.\\
139 - Sheldon: Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you're looking for is a double mother suckler.\\
140 - Leonard: Yeah, you're right. That is the term I'm looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler.\\
141 - Sheldon: Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you.\\
142 - Penny: We're not in a rush. We'll set a date when the time is right.\\
143 - Mrs Cooper: It doesn't matter, sweetie. The moment a man lays with a woman, they are married in the eyes of the Lord.\\
144 - Dr Hofstadter: Uch.\\
145 - Mrs Cooper: Uch? The bible is uch to you?\\
146 - Dr Hofstadter: No, I'm sorry. That was inappropriate. As a psychiatrist, I know how important people's superstitions can be to them.\\
147 - Mrs Cooper: You want to talk about superstitions? Sheldon sent me the books you wrote, all that nonsense about superegos and ids. What bull dropped that on the barn floor?\\
148 - Dr Hofstadter: His name is Sigmund Freud.\\
149 - Penny: Hey, look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.\\
150 - Mrs Cooper: Stay out of this.\\
151 - Penny: Mm-hmm.\\
152 - Mrs Cooper: At least the bearded man that I believe in preaches love and compassion. All yours talks about is why you hold in your poop and want to crawl back inside your mama.\\
153 - Dr Hofstadter: It's fascinating. How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon come from someone like you?\\
154 - Mrs Cooper: I know the answer. You're not gonna like it.\\
155 - Dr Hofstadter: Try me.\\
156 - Mrs Cooper: When I was pregnant with Shelly, I was driving to church, and I was praying to the Lord to give me a son smarter than his dumb-ass daddy. And I looked over and I saw a Jesus bobblehead in the Subaru next to me nodding yes. What is that supposed to mean?\\
157 - Dr Hofstadter: : It means, I can't believe we're having this conversation.\\
158 - Mrs Cooper: Well, do it some more. Maybe you can knock some sense into yourself.\\
159 - Penny: Why don't we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.\\
160 - Sheldon: It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.\\
161 - Leonard: Oh, don't flatter yourself. She likes everybody better than she likes me.\\
162 - [ Howard and Bernadette's house ]\\
163 - Raj: How old is this Jell-O?\\
164 - Stuart: Well, it's carrots, so gonna say very.\\
165 - Howard: Sorry we have to do this.\\
166 - Stuart: Bernadette's not wrong. She does work hard around here.\\
167 - Raj: Yeah, maybe it's a good thing if she stops babying you so much.\\
168 - Howard: She doesn't baby me.\\
169 - Stuart: I saw her pull you home in a wagon.\\
170 - Howard: For your information, I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck.\\
171 - Raj: Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship.\\
172 - Howard: You're right. It's time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. Bernie, I made a mess.\\
173 - [ A coffee shop ]\\
174 - Dr Hofstadter: I'm terribly sorry that I upset your mother.\\
175 - Sheldon: Oh, it's all right. She'll forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell.\\
176 - Dr Hofstadter: I can't help but notice how her unconditional love for you is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies.\\
177 - Sheldon: Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.\\
178 - Dr Hofstadter: But look how well you turned out.\\
179 - Sheldon: I'd feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonard's brother and sister are.\\
180 - Dr Hofstadter: I suppose.\\
181 - Sheldon: While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.\\
182 - Dr Hofstadter: Do you suppose you would've flourished more in a reward-based environment?\\
183 - Sheldon: Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted, so who cares?\\
184 - [ The apartment ]\\
185 - Leonard: Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself, I always had to earn it.\\
186 - Mrs Cooper: Oh, Leonard, I'm sure she loves you very much. In her own cold godless way.\\
187 - Penny: Yeah, and you certainly don't have to earn my love.\\
188 - Leonard: Thank you.\\
189 - Penny: Of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit.\\
190 - Leonard: That's not what it is.\\
191 - Penny: I know, I know. Zzzzzzzz.\\
192 - Mrs Cooper: When your mom gets back, I'm gonna need to apologize for the way I spoke to her.\\
193 - Penny: Well, come on now, she did kind of start it.\\
194 - Mrs Cooper: Doesn't matter, a good Christian would've turned the other cheek. On the other hand, a good Texan would've shot her, so, I just kind of split the difference. Hey, who's in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs?\\
195 - Leonard: Oh, me.\\
196 - Penny: Yeah, me, too.\\
197 - Mrs Cooper: Coming up.\\
198 - Leonard: I don't really feel I deserve it.\\
199 - [ Howard and Bernadette's house ]\\
200 - Howard: That was a big sticky mess, but I think I got it.\\
201 - Raj: Looks good.\\
202 - Stuart: Yeah.\\
203 - Bernadette: Look at that. You cleaned it up all by yourself.\\
204 - Howard: Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself. Honestly, I don't know why you complain so… okay, maybe I missed one spot. Just leave.\\
205 - [ The apartment ]\\
206 - Mrs Cooper: I'm so glad that you and I were able to bury the hatchet.\\
207 - Dr Hofstadter: Me, too. And I respect your right to your beliefs.\\
208 - Mrs Cooper: And I will pray for you.\\
209 - Leonard: Okay, Mom, let's get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else.\\
210 - Dr Hofstadter: One moment. There's something I need to say to you.\\
211 - Leonard: Oh, really? That's too bad.\\
212 - Dr Hofstadter: Leonard, I always made you earn my affection, but today I realize that there's more than one way to raise a child.\\
213 - Sheldon: I taught her that.\\
214 - Dr Hofstadter: Therefore, I would like to initiate a new protocol wherein I shower you with unconditional love.\\
215 - Leonard: Wow. When does that start?\\
216 - Dr Hofstadter: So needy. Come to Mommy.\\
217 - Penny: It's okay, go ahead.\\
218 - Dr Hofstadter: Oh, my son.\\
219 - Leonard: Oh, my mother.\\
220 - Penny: Oh, my God.\\
221 - [ Howard and Bernadette's house ]\\
222 - Stuart:  It's a hard-knock life \\
223 - Together:  It's the hard-knock life for us \\
224 -  It's the hard-knock life for us \\
225 -  'Stead of treated, we get tricked \\
226 -  'Stead of kisses, we get kicked \\
227 -  It's the hard-knock life \\
228 -  Got no folks to speak of so \\
229 -  It's the hard-knock row we hoe \\
230 -  Cotton blankets... 'stead of wool \\
231 -  Empty bellies... 'stead of full \\
232 -  It's a hard-knock life.

2 - Amy: Can you believe it's been five years since our first date?\\
3 - Sheldon: I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?\\
4 - Amy: That's what you're thinking about?\\
5 - Sheldon: Well, one of the things.\\
6 - Amy: Are any of them me?\\
7 - Sheldon: Yes. I thought, "I can't decide if I should watch The Flash TV show. I know, I'll ask Amy." Anyway...\\
8 - Amy: What are you doing?\\
9 - Sheldon: You're right, you did kind of kill the mood.\\
10 - Amy: I didn't kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show.\\
11 - Sheldon: Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn't a decision to take lightly. I'm wrestling with a big commitment issue here.\\
12 - Amy: Really? That's the commitment issue you're wrestling with? Sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all I can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?\\
13 - Sheldon: Irony's not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try.\\
14 - Amy: (sarcastically) Oh, sure, I'd love to.\\
15 - Sheldon: Whenever you're ready.\\

29 - [ The comic book store ]\\
30 - Stuart: I don't want to rush you, but I'm closing a little early tonight.\\
31 - Raj: Ooh. Hot date?\\
32 - Stuart: Uh, no. I overheard Bernadette tell Howard she was making him a meat loaf, and you don't have to not ask me twice.\\
33 - Emily: If I stick a light bulb on this, wouldn't it make a great lamp for my bedroom?\\
34 - Raj: You're kidding, right?\\
35 - Emily: Oh. Is this freaking you out?\\
36 - Raj: I guess I'm just more of a Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.\\
37 - Emily: All right. Never mind.\\
38 - Raj: No, no, no. Hey, you should totally get it. In fact, I'll buy it for you.\\
39 - Stuart: Sold.\\
40 - Emily: Raj, you don't have to do that.\\
41 - Stuart: Too late. No returns.\\
42 - [ The stairwell ]\\
43 - Leonard: That was really intense.\\
44 - Penny: Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers' market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables.\\
45 - Leonard: Hey.\\
46 - Sheldon: Oh, good. You're here. I need your assistance.\\
47 - Leonard: Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?\\
48 - Sheldon: What happened?\\
49 - Penny: Oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.\\
50 - Sheldon: Been there.\\
51 - Penny: Mmm. So what do you need help with?\\
52 - Sheldon: Amy's mad at me, and I'm not clear why.\\
53 - Penny: Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?\\
54 - Sheldon: Yes.\\
55 - Penny: That's probably it. What'd you say to her?\\
56 - Sheldon: Well, I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series.\\
57 - Penny: And that made her angry?\\
58 - Sheldon: Baffling, right? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face.\\
59 - Penny: Well, Sheldon, when you're kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her.\\
60 - Sheldon: It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.\\
61 - Penny: Yeah. I'm tapping out. Leonard?\\
62 - Leonard: I'm gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.\\
63 - Sheldon: Oh, no, not just a season. If I'm in, I'm in for the whole run, even if the quality declines.\\
64 - Leonard: I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.\\
65 - Sheldon: Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.\\
66 - Penny: Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night.\\
67 - Sheldon: Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary.\\
68 - Penny: Okay, see, that's even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat.\\
69 - Sheldon: If that happens, don't make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can.\\
70 - [ Howard and Bernadette's house ]\\
71 - Raj: You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?\\
72 - Bernadette: You mean 'cause she has weird tattoos?\\
73 - Raj: No, because she wants to have s*x with me in a graveyard.\\
74 - Howard: One more time?\\
75 - Raj: She and I were supposed to watch the new Avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out. So I said, "What else do you want to do?" She said, "Let's go to a cemetery and do it on somebody's grave."\\
76 - Howard: Like, a random person or somebody she knew?\\
77 - Raj: What difference does it make?\\
78 - Howard: Well, if it's her father's grave and they didn't get along, then you know she holds a grudge.\\
79 - Bernadette: The only issue is that everybody has their own thing, and as long as it's two consenting adults, I guess I don't see the harm in it.\\
80 - Raj: Well, what if it's one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he's afraid of being alone?\\
81 - Bernadette: Well, then I guess bring a blanket. The grass gets damp at night.\\
82 - Raj: I don't know, guys. Maybe this relationship isn't for me. Maybe I should break up with her.\\
83 - Howard: (chuckles) Right. You're gonna break up with a girl who has s*x with you. Can you believe this guy?\\
84 - Bernadette: I think if Raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it.\\
85 - Howard: How are you saying that with a straight face?\\
86 - Bernadette: (chuckling) I don't know.\\
87 - Raj: You guys are being jerks.\\
88 - Howard: Buddy, other than Jenny Craig, you've never broken up with a girl in your life.\\
89 - Raj: You're one to talk. You've been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don't see you showing him the door.\\
90 - Howard: That's not the same thing. Emily's a person. Stuart's more like an infestation, something you spray for.\\
91 - Raj: Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone's feelings as I am.\\
92 - Bernadette: That's not true. We were just laughing right in your face.\\
93 - [ The apartment ]\\
94 - Penny: Thanks for cooking.\\
95 - Leonard: Mmm. My pleasure.\\
96 - Penny: That carrot was delicious.\\
97 - Leonard: Yeah. I wish I'd fought harder for the rest of 'em.\\
98 - Penny: Still haven't heard from her?\\
99 - Sheldon: No, and I'm confused. It's been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out she's wrong by now.\\
100 - Penny: Hey, I don't think she's wrong about you going too slow in the relationship.\\
101 - Sheldon: Too slow?\\
102 - Penny: Yeah, you've been going out for years. You haven't even slept together.\\
103 - Sheldon: That's right. It's called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two aren't moving forward in your relationship.\\
104 - Penny: (scoffs) Uh, hello.\\
105 - Sheldon: Hello.\\
106 - Penny: No. Sheldon, we're getting married.\\
107 - Sheldon: But you've been engaged for over a year now, and you don't even have a wedding date.\\
108 - Penny: Well, we will. We're just not in a rush.\\
109 - Sheldon: Okay.\\
110 - Leonard: We're gonna set a date.\\
111 - Sheldon: Okay. If you say so.\\
112 - Penny: Yeah, it's just, things are good right now.\\
113 - Leonard: Really good.\\
114 - Penny: I'm focusing on my job.\\
115 - Leonard: And we've been busy with our paper.\\
116 - Penny: So busy.\\
117 - Leonard: Yeah, we'll pick a date when we pick a date.\\
118 - Penny: Yeah.\\
119 - Sheldon: Okay.\\
120 - Penny: You know, I can see why Amy's mad at you.\\
121 - Sheldon: Yeah, shut up, Sheldon.\\
122 - [ Howard and Bernadette's house ]\\
123 - Bernadette: Did you eat all my yoghurt?\\
124 - Howard: You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they don't do even though they do?\\
125 - Bernadette: You know... which yoghurt I mean.\\
126 - Howard: I didn't touch it. Must have been Stuart.\\
127 - Bernadette: (sighs) Maybe Raj is right. Maybe it's time we tell him he needs to move out.\\
128 - Howard: We should have done it months ago.\\
129 - Bernadette: I know, but his store was reopening, and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick.\\
130 - Howard: (groans) Yeah, right. Sick. He didn't have jaundice. He just looks like that.\\
131 - Bernadette: All right. Tonight's the night.\\
132 - Howard: Agreed. When he gets home, I'm dropping the hammer.\\
133 - Bernadette: Ooh, I like when you take charge.\\
134 - Howard: Oh, I'm not taking charge, you're the hammer.\\
135 - [ The apartment ]\\
136 - Leonard: So... why haven't we picked a date?\\
137 - Penny: You know why.\\
138 - Leonard: Well, of course I know why. But just for fun... why?\\
139 - Penny: Not in a rush, busy with work...\\
140 - Sheldon: Things are good right now.\\
141 - Penny: Really good.\\
142 - Leonard: You still want to get married, right?\\
143 - Penny: Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?\\
144 - Leonard: I don't know. Because we don't have a date?\\
145 - Penny: Well, you want a date, pick a date.\\
146 - Leonard: It's not just the date. We haven't talked about anything. Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor?\\
147 - Sheldon: Outdoor? Oh. I can RSVP no right now.\\
148 - Penny: Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?\\
149 - Leonard: Is your dad paying for it?\\
150 - Penny: I doubt it.\\
151 - Leonard: Okay, two friends each.\\
152 - Penny: All right, well, I want it in a church.\\
153 - Leonard: Fine. I want black-tie.\\
154 - Penny: Fine. I want to release butterflies.\\
155 - Sheldon: Seriously? Airborne worms?\\
156 - Leonard: Okay. Well, then it's settled: small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies.\\
157 - Penny: Sounds perfect.\\
158 - Leonard: Great.\\
159 - Sheldon: You still didn't pick a date.\\
160 - Penny: Stay out of it.\\
161 - Leonard: Shut up.\\
162 - [ A graveyard ]\\
163 - Emily: Mmm. It's a beautiful night.\\
164 - Raj: Oh, yes, we've got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty, who apparently died when she was the same age I am.\\
165 - Emily: Makes you feel alive, doesn't it?\\
166 - Raj: So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant, but here we are.\\
167 - Emily: You aren't scared, are you?\\
168 - Raj: Of ghosts, no. Of you, little bit.\\
169 - [ The apartment ]\\
170 - Sheldon: I'm sorry I've upset you. I shouldn't have asked so many questions.\\
171 - Penny: No, it's okay.\\
172 - Leonard: Yeah, maybe it's good you got us talking about this stuff.\\
173 - Sheldon: Well, look at that, even when I'm causing problems, I make the world a better place. Hey, next, why don't we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny's love of the ol' glug-glug?\\
174 - Penny: Uh, Sheldon, I think we're good for now.\\
175 - Sheldon: Ah, well... very well. So does this mean you'll finally pick a wedding date?\\
176 - Penny: (sighs) Here we go again. Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? We're committed to each other. We're happy. A ceremony isn't gonna change anything.\\
177 - Sheldon: So you're never getting married? It's his whining, isn't it?\\
178 - Leonard: Sheldon, I'm not a whiner.\\
179 - Sheldon: It's amusing that he doesn't hear it.\\
180 - Leonard: Look, all she's saying is we are in love so it doesn't matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now.\\
181 - Penny: Ew, 50? We'll be old and gross.\\
182 - Leonard: Yeah, but we'll be old and gross together.\\
183 - Sheldon: My aunt and uncle were married 63 years. Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt.\\
184 - Penny: Um... I'm free tonight.\\
185 - Leonard: Are you saying you want to get married?\\
186 - Penny: Vegas isn't that far away.\\
187 - Leonard: I'm in. Let's do it.\\
188 - Sheldon: After all these years. I'm really happy for the two of you.\\
189 - Penny: Oh, thank you.\\
190 - Leonard: Thanks.\\
191 - Sheldon: Now get out of my spot.\\
192 - [ Howard and Bernadette's house ]\\
193 - Howard: Bernie, Stuart just pulled up. So remember, the key is to be firm. Show no weakness.\\
194 - Bernadette: Right.\\
195 - Howard: Good luck.\\
196 - Bernadette: Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here.\\
197 - Howard: (mutters) Never should have told you my middle name.\\
198 - Stuart: Hey, guys.\\
199 - Howard: Hey, you got a minute?\\
200 - Stuart: Sure. Uh, let me just put this stuff in the fridge. I felt bad for finishing your yoghurt, so I bought more. And, Howard, your favourite fruit is in season. Crunch Berries.\\
201 - Bernadette: Don't let that sway you.\\
202 - Howard: It's hard not to. They taste so much better than real berries.\\
203 - Stuart: What's up?\\
204 - Bernadette: So... we need to talk.\\
205 - [ The graveyard ]\\
206 - Emily: You okay?\\
207 - Raj: I think we should talk.\\
208 - [ Howard and Bernadette's house ]\\
209 - Stuart: Is everything okay?\\
210 - Bernadette: Well... you've been living here a while now.\\
211 - Stuart: I know. I may sell comic books at work, but the real superheroes are sitting right in front of me.\\
212 - Bernadette: Yeah...\\
213 - Howard: His middle name is David. Go.\\
214 - [ The graveyard ]\\
215 - Raj: Look, I care about you a lot, but we are very different people.\\
216 - Emily: Are you breaking up with me?\\
217 - Raj: No, no, I'm just pointing out that you're dark on the inside and I'm dark on the outside.\\
218 - [ Howard and Bernadette's house ]\\
219 - Bernadette: So, anyway, what I'm trying to say is... (phone rings)\\
220 - Howard: You need to take that?\\
221 - Stuart: It's just my dad, probably calling to wish me a happy birthday. I'll call him back. You were saying?\\
222 - [ The graveyard ]\\
223 - Emily: Look, Raj, be honest with me. If you want to end things, just do it. Don't expect me to do it for you.\\
224 - Raj: End things? I'm trying to tell you that I love you.\\
225 - [ Howard and Bernadette's house ]\\
226 - Howard and Bernadette:  Happy birthday to you. \\
227 - [ Leonard's car ]\\
228 - Penny: Wow, there's a Denny's in Vegas you can actually get married in.\\
229 - Leonard: (chuckles) Doesn't sound very romantic.\\
230 - Penny: Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes.\\
231 - Leonard: I'm sure we'll find a decent chapel.\\
232 - Penny: Yeah. This is crazy!\\
233 - Leonard: I know! You think people are gonna be mad?\\
234 - Penny: Maybe. But this isn't about them; it's about us.\\
235 - Leonard: It is. It is about us.\\
236 - Penny: And you know what the best part is? We took our time. I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets.\\
237 - Leonard: Right. No surprises.\\
238 - Penny: And no regrets.\\
239 - Leonard: Uh, well, there- there's one thing I feel I should tell you.\\
240 - Penny: What?\\
241 - Leonard: You know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us.\\
242 - Penny: What?\\
243 - Leonard: Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?\\
244 - Penny: Yeah.\\
245 - Leonard: Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on...\\
246 - Penny: No, you told me.\\
247 - Leonard: Okay, um... well, there was this girl.\\
248 - Penny: What did you do?\\
249 - Leonard: Nothing... really. It was just kissing.\\
250 - Penny: And then what?\\
251 - Leonard: And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me... and I wanted you to know.\\
252 - Penny: All right.\\
253 - Leonard: Did you ever do anything like this since we've been?\\
254 - Penny: Nope, never.\\
255 - Leonard: Oh, that's too bad.\\
256 - Penny: You know, can I ask you a question?\\
257 - Leonard: Hmm?\\
258 - Penny: Why are you telling me this now?\\
259 - Leonard: Well, like I said, we're about to get married, and I-I want a clean slate. No secrets.\\
260 - Penny: Really? Be- Because to me, it seems like we're about to get married and you're trying to sabotage it.\\
261 - Leonard: W-Would you rather I didn't tell you?\\
262 - Penny: No, I don't want there to be secrets between us.\\
263 - Leonard: See, now I'm confused. I mean, what- what am I supposed to do?\\
264 - Penny: Uh, keep your mouth off other women.\\
265 - Leonard: I can do that. Uh, uh, f-from now on, this mouth, you and food, that's it.\\
266 - Penny: (sighs) Okay.\\
267 - Leonard: Yeah?\\
268 - Penny: Look, I'm not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we weren't engaged at the time, and it was just kissing.\\
269 - Leonard: Right.\\
270 - Penny: Just kissing.\\
271 - Leonard: It wasn't even very good. She was a smoker, I'd just been seasick...\\
272 - Penny: Okay, that's enough. Stop talking.\\
273 - Leonard: So... we're still getting married?\\
274 - Penny: Yes.\\
275 - Leonard: Because we love each other.\\
276 - Penny: Yes.\\
277 - Leonard: And it's the happiest day of our lives.\\
278 - Penny: (short laugh) Don't push it.\\
279 - [ The apartment ]\\
280 - (line ringing)\\
281 - Amy:  Hello.\\
282 - Sheldon: Hello. Listen, I've been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and I think...\\
283 - Amy: I've been thinking about them, too, Sheldon. Being your girlfriend is so challenging. Emotionally, physically. I've been incredibly patient for years.\\
284 - Sheldon: Strongly disagree. Go on.\\
285 - Amy: Okay, well, this isn't easy to say, because I love you, but I need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation.\\
286 - Sheldon: Oh.\\
287 - Amy: I hope you understand.\\
288 - Sheldon: Okay.\\
289 - Amy: Bye, Sheldon.\\
290 - Sheldon: Well, Gollum, you're an expert on rings. What do I do with this one?
